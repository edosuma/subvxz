00:44.294 --> 00:46.755
Another great race today, Johnny.

00:46.797 --> 00:49.174
Who are you gonna ride in the Stakes?

00:49.216 --> 00:51.927
Eddie, like my daddy
always used to say...

00:51.969 --> 00:54.429
...and I live by it...

00:54.471 --> 00:57.140
"Never change horses in midstream."

00:57.182 --> 01:02.145
Never change horses.
Sounds like a smart bet.

01:02.187 --> 01:05.607
Always stick with a winner.

01:05.649 --> 01:08.318
Keep America working.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.946
Don't change horses in midstream.

01:10.988 --> 01:16.118
On election day, reelect the president.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.549
Can you step this way, Mr. Brean?

01:30.590 --> 01:34.136
Lift your arms, please.

01:34.177 --> 01:38.557
That's him. That's Mr. Fix-it.

02:53.256 --> 02:56.551
It's right here.

03:04.976 --> 03:07.062
You can have a seat right here, Connie.

03:07.104 --> 03:11.108
He doesn't know anything.

03:13.777 --> 03:16.071
John Levy's staff, his assistant...

03:16.113 --> 03:20.742
...and of course Amy Cain, Press.

03:23.328 --> 03:26.373
Yes. Thank you. That'll be
all. Thank you, gentlemen.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.750
- Want some coffee?
- Yeah, black, please.

03:28.792 --> 03:32.921
Gaviston, bring some
coffee, please. Black.

03:32.963 --> 03:36.383
All right. You kids here in this room...

03:36.425 --> 03:38.885
...what you hear here, what say
here and what you do here...

03:38.927 --> 03:41.263
...if it gets out, you leaked it.

03:41.304 --> 03:42.556
Tell them what they need to know.

03:42.597 --> 03:48.061
When it broke, the president said
one thing, "Get me Conrad Brean."

03:48.103 --> 03:49.855
Anyway. What's the thing?

03:49.896 --> 03:54.025
He had an illegal immigrant nanny
some years back? Didn't declare?

03:54.067 --> 03:57.028
You people get ahead in the polls,
all of a sudden you get nervous.

03:57.070 --> 04:00.115
He made a pass at some
secretary some years ago?

04:00.157 --> 04:02.951
There was a group of Firefly Girls
from Sante Fe were here last month.

04:02.993 --> 04:05.287
One of the girls expressed interest
in the Frederic Remington bust.

04:05.328 --> 04:08.373
The President took her into the office, you know
the office behind the Oval Office for a period of...

04:08.415 --> 04:10.834
Three minutes. It couldn't
have been over three minutes.

04:10.876 --> 04:12.711
The Secret Service will
back me up on that.

04:12.752 --> 04:15.505
So, it's not the illegal
immigrant nanny thing?

04:15.547 --> 04:19.301
The girl's alleging...

04:21.887 --> 04:24.431
Jesus, Mary, Joseph.

04:24.473 --> 04:28.143
Maybe we could say it was a
funny drug reaction to the flu.

04:28.185 --> 04:29.686
Who's got the story?

04:29.728 --> 04:30.645
Don't you want to know if it's true?

04:30.687 --> 04:32.022
What difference does it
make, if it is true?

04:32.063 --> 04:34.441
It's a story and it breaks.
They gonna have to run with it.

04:34.483 --> 04:35.984
How long we've got till it breaks?

04:36.026 --> 04:38.028
Front page, Washington Post, tomorrow.

04:38.069 --> 04:40.280
Well, yeah. That's not good.

04:40.322 --> 04:43.658
- Ok. Where is he?
- China.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.327
When is he due back?

04:45.368 --> 04:49.539
They're set to leave pretty soon.

04:49.581 --> 04:53.668
Yeah, well. All right. He stays on the
ground in China at least another day.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.837
Why?

04:55.879 --> 04:57.380
- You the Press Office?
- Yes.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.216
Earn your money. He's
ill. Play he's sick.

04:59.257 --> 05:00.550
When do we bring him back?

05:00.592 --> 05:03.094
I'm gonna need a day. At least a day.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.180
He's sick. Get that out right now.

05:05.222 --> 05:07.140
Get them on the phone and tell
the jackals how sick he is.

05:07.182 --> 05:10.560
We gotta get that out before the story
breaks. We have to correspond to it.

05:10.602 --> 05:12.521
Issue a bulletin. He's
got some rare strain...

05:12.562 --> 05:15.524
- Won't hold.
- I need a day. I need some running time.

05:15.565 --> 05:16.733
It won't hold a day, Connie.

05:16.775 --> 05:18.735
Yes, it will. You know
why? I'll tell you why.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.237
Why is the president in China?

05:20.278 --> 05:22.864
- Trade relations.
- You're goddamn right.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.741
It's got nothing to do
with the B-3 bomber.

05:24.783 --> 05:28.578
- There is no B-3 bomber.
- I just said that. There is no B-3 bomber.

05:28.620 --> 05:32.207
I don't know why these
rumors get started.

05:32.249 --> 05:35.293
All right. I need $20,000. I need a car.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.337
All right. Get me a car and driver.

05:37.379 --> 05:41.466
The southwest gate now, please.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.843
What?

05:43.885 --> 05:45.053
What is it?

05:45.095 --> 05:47.389
Campaign commercial.
Should we look at it?

05:47.430 --> 05:49.182
Yeah, yeah. Put it in.

05:49.224 --> 05:50.892
This should be interesting.

05:50.934 --> 05:52.686
What is it?

05:52.727 --> 05:54.813
The rough cut. The other
side's new commercial.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.273
The Neal commercial?

05:56.314 --> 05:58.066
Yeah. We had somebody steal it.

05:58.108 --> 06:00.944
This'll be on the air
the day after tomorrow.

06:00.986 --> 06:03.738
In the final days of the campaign...

06:03.780 --> 06:05.740
...has the president changed his tune?

06:05.782 --> 06:09.286
♪ Thank heaven for little girls.

06:09.327 --> 06:11.413
The presidency is about honor.

06:11.454 --> 06:15.125
♪ Thank heaven for little girls.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.085
It's about principles.

06:17.127 --> 06:20.005
♪ Without them, what
♪ would little boys do?

06:20.046 --> 06:22.632
And it's about integrity.

06:22.674 --> 06:25.760
This tune has got to change.

06:25.802 --> 06:30.932
On election day, vote
Neal for president.

06:30.974 --> 06:33.602
Oh, boy.

06:34.144 --> 06:36.313
All right. Who's gonna take
the press conference today?

06:36.354 --> 06:37.981
Is there a press conference today?

06:38.023 --> 06:39.733
What do you think?

06:39.774 --> 06:42.110
We gonna have to use this
as a base of operations.

06:42.152 --> 06:44.195
I'm gonna need one day, two days.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.115
Whoever's leaking that stuff
to the Post lets it slip...

06:47.157 --> 06:50.243
"I hope this won't screw
up the B-3 program."

06:50.285 --> 06:53.580
"What B-3 program, and why
should it screw it up?"

06:53.622 --> 06:55.999
"If the president decides
to deploy the B-3...

06:56.041 --> 06:57.876
"...before it's fully tested..."

06:57.917 --> 07:00.462
"Deploy the B-3 before
it's fully tested?"

07:00.503 --> 07:02.631
"Yeah. Why?"

07:02.672 --> 07:03.965
"Why? The crisis."

07:04.007 --> 07:08.470
- What crisis?
- I'm working on that.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.639
At the same time get General Scott
and the Joint Chiefs of Staff...

07:10.680 --> 07:12.307
...and put them on a plane
to Seattle right away.

07:12.349 --> 07:15.644
He's nervous to talk
to the Boeing people.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.145
- But?
- But? But what?

07:17.187 --> 07:18.480
But there isn't a B-3 bomber.

07:18.521 --> 07:20.523
- Where'd you go to school? Wellesley?
- Dartmouth.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.734
Show a little spunk.
There is no B-3 bomber.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.027
General Scott, to the
best of your knowledge...

07:24.069 --> 07:25.820
...is not in Seattle to talk to Boeing.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.155
Connie, it won't prove out.

07:27.197 --> 07:30.659
It doesn't have to prove out. We just gotta
distract them. We just gotta distract them.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.494
Got less than two weeks
till the election.

07:32.535 --> 07:35.497
What in the world would do that?
What in the world would do that?

07:35.538 --> 07:40.502
I'm working on it. I'm working on it.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.507
Winifred, Mr. Brean.

07:45.548 --> 07:46.341
Thank you.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.009
- What's this?
- $20,000.

07:48.051 --> 07:50.679
I gotta go to L.A. and
see a Hollywood producer.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.639
Meet me at National in an hour.

07:52.681 --> 07:54.849
We'll go to Chicago and
connect there to L.A.

07:54.891 --> 07:58.478
See you at National.

08:03.775 --> 08:06.611
Tell me... Tell me...
Tell me this again.

08:06.653 --> 08:09.197
We landing?

08:09.239 --> 08:10.740
Tell me again.

08:10.782 --> 08:13.201
Don't worry about. It's nothing new.

08:13.243 --> 08:17.414
During Reagan's administration,
240 Marines killed in Beirut.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.541
24 hours later, we invade Grenada.

08:19.582 --> 08:20.542
That was their M.O.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.168
Change the story, change the lead.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.545
It's not a new concept.

08:23.586 --> 08:25.547
Wake me when we land. We'll talk more.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.841
Wait. We can't afford a war.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.926
We're not gonna have a war.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.469
We're having the appearance of a war.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.179
We cannot afford appearance of a war.

08:33.221 --> 08:36.683
- What'll it cost?
- But they would find out.

08:36.725 --> 08:38.518
Who's gonna find out?
The American people?

08:38.559 --> 08:41.604
- Exactly.
- Who's gonna tell them?

08:41.645 --> 08:43.773
What did they find out
about the Gulf War?

08:43.815 --> 08:46.901
One video of one bomb falls down
a chimney. Blows up the building.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.445
The building could have
been made out of Legos.

08:48.486 --> 08:53.283
- You really want us to go to war?
- That's the general idea.

08:53.324 --> 08:54.701
With who?

08:54.743 --> 08:58.163
I'm working on it.

08:58.663 --> 09:01.833
- Albania?
- Yeah.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.126
Why?

09:03.168 --> 09:05.295
Why not? What do you know about them?

09:05.336 --> 09:07.672
- Nothing.
- Precisely.

09:07.714 --> 09:10.592
They seem shifty, they seem standoffish.

09:10.633 --> 09:13.678
I mean, who knows from Albania? What do you
know about Albania? Who trusts Albanians?

09:13.720 --> 09:15.597
What did Albania ever do to us?

09:15.638 --> 09:16.765
What did they do for us?

09:16.806 --> 09:19.559
This is why we have to
mobilize the B-3 bomber.

09:19.601 --> 09:21.561
You really want to go
to war with Albania?

09:21.603 --> 09:24.731
We don't have a choice.
This is what you do.

09:24.773 --> 09:27.275
Get your press office
right now to deny it.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.777
It didn't happen.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.613
"Deny. There is no report
of Albanian activity."

09:31.654 --> 09:32.947
They have to deny it.

09:32.989 --> 09:36.618
- It didn't happen.
- Deny. Deny. Deny.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.828
...news from the president
on his visit to China.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.622
Another sort of news, however...

09:40.663 --> 09:42.582
...has emerged from the
presidential quarter.

09:42.624 --> 09:45.460
We turn to Melissa Gardner
at KZAB in Sante Fe...

09:45.502 --> 09:47.462
...with this breaking news. Melissa.

09:47.504 --> 09:50.340
Thanks, Richard. Today
a local Firefly Girl...

09:50.381 --> 09:53.134
...accused the president
of sexual misconduct.

09:53.176 --> 09:55.470
This photo of the
president with the girls...

09:55.512 --> 09:58.556
...was taken during their
recent tour of the White House.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.892
The girl claims that
the sexual misconduct...

10:00.934 --> 10:03.269
...occurred inside the Oval Office.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.480
Her attorney says there
are no plans yet...

10:05.522 --> 10:06.731
...to hold a press conference.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.442
Right now, folks in Sante Fe
and the rest of America...

10:09.484 --> 10:12.153
...are waiting for a response
from the White House...

10:12.195 --> 10:13.822
...on these harsh allegations.

10:13.863 --> 10:17.534
With the election only days
away, the big question is...

10:17.575 --> 10:20.662
...how much will this
scandal affect the outcome?

10:20.703 --> 10:22.455
Top people, Albanian desk.

10:22.497 --> 10:24.999
I don't know, either,
but probably we have one.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.668
Listen. I want you to
roust them out of bed.

10:26.709 --> 10:30.421
Albanian desk, CIA, NSA. Roust
them out of bed, sirens blaring.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.840
Honey, I know they're
gonna be up in an hour.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.925
I want them up now. Now, listen
to me. Tell your staff...

10:33.967 --> 10:35.677
General Scott in Seattle?

10:35.718 --> 10:39.639
Well. No. I don't think his trip
has to do with the B-3 bomber.

10:39.681 --> 10:42.016
Excuse me, Miss. I'll have
to ask you to turn that off.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.977
OK, I know. It'll just be a second.

10:44.018 --> 10:45.895
Miss, there are no
electronics on the plane.

10:45.937 --> 10:48.231
I really have to ask
you to turn that off.

10:48.273 --> 10:49.816
It'll just take two seconds.

10:49.858 --> 10:52.527
We've said flat out
there is no B-3 bomber.

10:52.569 --> 10:54.612
I understand. I understand.

10:54.654 --> 10:58.032
If it is true, he should,
he must step down...

10:58.074 --> 11:01.244
...and if it's not true, then he must...

11:01.286 --> 11:04.581
We are informed he has
extended his visit to China.

11:04.622 --> 11:07.917
I say on behalf of the
American people, come home.

11:07.959 --> 11:10.420
Face the music, whatever that may be.

11:10.461 --> 11:12.171
The election's in 11 days.

11:12.213 --> 11:14.048
Let the American people decide.

11:14.090 --> 11:15.884
"Let the American people decide."

11:15.925 --> 11:18.887
Senator Neal, presidential candidate.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.179
Excuse me, Senator.

11:20.221 --> 11:22.181
That's 11 days till the election...

11:22.223 --> 11:24.726
...and the president ahead
in the polls by... Bob?

11:24.767 --> 11:26.227
Seventeen percent.

11:26.269 --> 11:30.356
Accusations have surfaced
which could affect the outcome.

11:30.398 --> 11:31.733
The White House has announced that...

11:31.774 --> 11:33.568
...in response to the media pressure...

11:33.610 --> 11:35.445
...there will be a press conference.

11:35.486 --> 11:37.614
My God. This is how a
Hollywood producer lives?

11:37.655 --> 11:42.535
This is bigger than the White House.

11:43.077 --> 11:45.747
Get me my veggie shake, Rumond...

11:45.788 --> 11:47.332
...and remind me to turn
over in 10 minutes...

11:47.373 --> 11:50.501
...to tan the other side.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.629
Do I know you?

11:52.670 --> 11:55.173
We have some mutual
friends in Washington.

11:55.214 --> 11:58.760
Yes, as you said, and is it true?

11:58.801 --> 12:00.470
Mr. Motss, I wouldn't...

12:00.511 --> 12:03.765
You wouldn't be here if it
wasn't true. It's true, right?

12:03.806 --> 12:07.560
Really, who could say?

12:07.644 --> 12:10.313
I like the guy. He
signed his book to me...

12:10.355 --> 12:13.399
..."For two generations...
"I mean... What was it?

12:13.441 --> 12:16.277
"For progress to
occur," I think he said.

12:16.319 --> 12:18.821
Two Generations to Agree, yes.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.949
That's what he inscribed.
How'd you know that?

12:20.990 --> 12:22.325
That's the title of the book.

12:22.367 --> 12:25.161
That's the title?

12:25.203 --> 12:27.956
For Progress to Occur It's
Necessary for Two Generations to...

12:27.997 --> 12:31.918
That's a terrible title.

12:33.044 --> 12:34.420
You're right.

12:34.462 --> 12:37.298
For Two Generations to
Agree. That is the title.

12:37.340 --> 12:38.633
You know. I never looked at the cover.

12:38.675 --> 12:40.176
I just looked at what he wrote to me.

12:40.218 --> 12:42.261
When you get the time,
you can read the cover.

12:42.303 --> 12:46.140
John Levy is expected to respond
to the Firefly allegations...

12:46.182 --> 12:48.226
...of sexual misconduct
by the president.

12:48.267 --> 12:51.771
This guy is fucked.

12:53.272 --> 12:56.150
What one has to do, Mr. Motss,
is fight a holding action.

12:56.192 --> 12:59.821
Holding action? They're going to
run this man through the shredder.

12:59.862 --> 13:02.991
If we can hold the break in the dam
for 11 days till the election...

13:03.032 --> 13:04.325
...I think we got a chance.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.661
You can't hold the dam.
I mean, how the hell...

13:06.703 --> 13:10.331
I don't get what you want me to do.

13:10.373 --> 13:15.503
...advised him to stay on the ground
in China for one or two days.

13:15.545 --> 13:18.006
During that time, of
course, we'll remain...

13:18.047 --> 13:19.340
But he's gotta come back sometime.

13:19.382 --> 13:21.551
What is one or two days gonna buy you?

13:21.592 --> 13:23.219
Look at all those hands.

13:23.261 --> 13:24.929
Brer Rabbit couldn't get out of this.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.348
Would you comment
please on the rumors...

13:27.390 --> 13:30.309
...that the president's fly...
the president's delay...

13:30.351 --> 13:34.188
...is due to the situation in Albania?

13:34.230 --> 13:35.982
There is...

13:36.024 --> 13:38.443
I'm not aware of the
situation to which you refer.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.528
Sir, we've just learned that
the State Department...

13:40.570 --> 13:43.948
...has set up a special Albanian
task force at Ops Center.

13:43.990 --> 13:48.327
Mr. Sklansky, I am... We
have... Mrs. Rose, yes?

13:48.369 --> 13:52.165
Early this morning, General
Scott flew to Seattle.

13:52.206 --> 13:55.376
Is his trip connected
with the B-3 bomber?

13:55.418 --> 14:00.381
Mrs. Rose, there... To the best of my
knowledge, there is no B-3 bomber.

14:00.423 --> 14:03.593
Mr. Levy, is the situation
in Albania related anyway...

14:03.634 --> 14:06.054
...to the Muslim fundamentalist
anti-American uprising?

14:06.095 --> 14:08.765
Now they get it. Now they get it.

14:08.806 --> 14:11.851
There you go. There's a little help.

14:11.893 --> 14:15.646
...that have some
fundamentalist movements...

14:15.688 --> 14:18.232
How close are you to this thing?

14:18.274 --> 14:22.820
What do you want the kid to say?

14:22.987 --> 14:26.199
We will keep you apprised
of any new information.

14:26.240 --> 14:31.162
Regarding these groups, at this
time, there is no information about...

14:31.204 --> 14:33.039
Have him say...

14:33.081 --> 14:35.917
I know we're all concerned
for the president.

14:35.958 --> 14:40.379
I'm sure that our hopes
and prayers are with him.

14:40.421 --> 14:42.090
Could you have Levy say...

14:42.131 --> 14:43.925
"I know we're all concerned
for the president.

14:43.966 --> 14:47.553
"I'm sure our hopes and
prayers are with him."

14:47.595 --> 14:53.643
I just wanna say that I know that we
are all concerned for the president...

14:53.684 --> 14:55.478
...and that our hopes
and prayers are with him.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.604
He didn't phrase it right.

14:56.646 --> 15:00.566
He didn't sell the line.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.821
All right, you bought
yourself one day, maybe two.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.323
For bring them together, all I
need is 11 till the election.

15:07.365 --> 15:09.742
Are you gonna stretch it? This
isn't gonna hold for 11 days.

15:09.784 --> 15:11.828
- The guy fucked a Girl Scout.
- A Firefly Girl.

15:11.869 --> 15:14.038
He fucked a Firefly Girl.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.623
What are you gonna do to hold that off?

15:15.665 --> 15:18.459
Excuse me. I'm gonna
get my veggie shake.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.294
What do you think would
hold it off, Mr. Motss?

15:20.336 --> 15:22.797
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

15:22.839 --> 15:28.427
I mean, you, you... You'd
have to have a war.

15:28.678 --> 15:33.474
You're kidding. You're not kidding.

15:35.560 --> 15:39.814
I'm in show business,
yes? Why come to me?

15:39.856 --> 15:42.567
I'll tell you why, Mr. Motss.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.819
"54, 40, or fight." What does that mean?

15:44.861 --> 15:47.238
- It's a slogan. It's from...
- "Remember the Maine."

15:47.280 --> 15:48.364
Yeah, that's gotta be.

15:48.406 --> 15:51.200
"Tippecanoe and Tyler, too."
- No, that's not.

15:51.242 --> 15:52.827
They're war slogans, Mr. Motss.

15:52.869 --> 15:55.288
We remember the slogans, we can't
even remember the fucking wars.

15:55.329 --> 15:56.664
- You know why?
- Why?

15:56.706 --> 15:59.542
- That's show business. That's why we're here.
- I see.

15:59.584 --> 16:01.335
Naked girl, covered in napalm.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.670
"V" for victory.

16:02.712 --> 16:06.007
5 Marines raising the
flag, Mount Surabachi.

16:06.048 --> 16:09.177
You remember the picture 50
years, but forget the war.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.512
The Gulf War, smart bomb
falling down a chimney.

16:11.554 --> 16:14.015
2,500 missions a day, 100 days.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.434
One video of one bomb, Mr. Motss.

16:16.475 --> 16:17.852
The American people bought that war.

16:17.894 --> 16:20.897
War is show business.
That's why we're here.

16:20.938 --> 16:24.525
And what do you do for the president?

16:24.567 --> 16:26.027
Why Albania?

16:26.068 --> 16:27.737
Why not?

16:27.778 --> 16:29.864
They gotta know at some point.

16:29.906 --> 16:32.241
Who?

16:32.617 --> 16:35.870
You know. The... The public.

16:35.912 --> 16:37.413
- They gotta know?
- Yes.

16:37.455 --> 16:39.582
Stan, get with it. Who killed Kennedy?

16:39.624 --> 16:41.334
I read the first draft
of the Warren Report.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.544
It says he was killed by a drunk driver.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.796
You watched The Gulf War. What
do you see day after day?

16:45.838 --> 16:47.965
The one smart bomb
falling down a chimney.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.258
The truth?

16:49.300 --> 16:51.510
I was in the building
when we shot that shot.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.512
We shot it in a studio in
Falls Church, Virginia.

16:53.554 --> 16:55.056
1/10 scale model of a building.

16:55.097 --> 16:56.057
Is that true?

16:56.098 --> 16:58.142
How the fuck do we
know? You take my point?

16:58.184 --> 16:59.936
Yes. All right. Ok.

16:59.977 --> 17:02.480
You want me to do what?

17:02.521 --> 17:03.773
We want you to produce.

17:03.814 --> 17:06.233
You want me to produce your war?

17:06.275 --> 17:08.152
Not a war. It's a pageant.

17:08.194 --> 17:11.030
We need a theme, a song, some visuals.

17:11.071 --> 17:12.240
It's a pageant.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.367
It's like the Oscars.
That's why we came to you.

17:14.407 --> 17:16.035
I never won an Oscar.

17:16.077 --> 17:18.412
That's a damn shame you didn't,
but you produced the Oscars.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.248
Yes. Indeed, I did.

17:20.289 --> 17:22.875
You know, you're a writer,
that's your script.

17:22.916 --> 17:25.627
You're a director, but if you're
the producer, what do you do...

17:25.670 --> 17:26.628
...nobody knows what you do.

17:26.671 --> 17:29.382
The producer, I mean, all
he's got is the credit.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.926
You see? And some plaques on the wall.

17:31.968 --> 17:35.763
They don't know what we
do. Don't get me started.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.556
If you never won an Oscar...

17:37.598 --> 17:39.392
...how would you like an ambassadorship?

17:39.433 --> 17:42.270
An ambassadorship? That's my payoff?

17:42.311 --> 17:43.896
Tell me what you want.

17:43.938 --> 17:46.732
Fellow, I'd just do it for fun
of it. For a story to tell.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.150
You couldn't tell anybody.

17:48.192 --> 17:50.236
I'm just kidding.

17:50.278 --> 17:52.947
- I mean, you couldn't tell anybody.
- No, no, no. It's just a figure of speech.

17:52.989 --> 17:55.324
It's a pageant.

17:55.366 --> 17:56.617
It's a pageant. That's what it is.

17:56.659 --> 17:57.702
The country's at war.

17:57.743 --> 17:58.911
It's Miss America. You're Bert Parks.

17:58.953 --> 18:01.038
- Why Albania?
- Because...

18:01.080 --> 18:03.624
They have to have something we want.
What do we have that they want?

18:03.666 --> 18:06.460
- Freedom.
- Why would they want that?

18:06.502 --> 18:09.130
- Oppressed?
- No, no, no. Fuck freedom.

18:09.171 --> 18:12.466
They want to destroy the
godless Satan on the United.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.677
They want to destroy our way of life.

18:14.719 --> 18:16.595
All right? Ok? Ok? Ok?

18:16.637 --> 18:18.347
The president is in China.

18:18.389 --> 18:23.644
He is dealing with the dispatch
of the B-3 bomber to Albania.

18:23.686 --> 18:26.022
Why?

18:27.064 --> 18:30.109
Why? Help me.

18:31.068 --> 18:34.447
All right, all right. Let's
see. Geo-politically if we...

18:34.488 --> 18:37.825
We just found out they have the bomb.

18:37.867 --> 18:41.495
We just found out they have the bomb.

18:41.537 --> 18:46.959
- That's good.
- And, and... wait a second.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.086
No, no. The bomb's not there...

18:49.128 --> 18:52.548
...because they'd have to
have a rocket and that shit.

18:52.590 --> 18:55.885
They are a bunch of wogs. No,
no. Cross that out. All right.

18:55.926 --> 18:58.012
It's a suitcase bomb.

18:58.054 --> 18:59.513
I didn't know I said that.

18:59.555 --> 19:02.058
It's a suitcase bomb.
You don't need missiles.

19:02.099 --> 19:04.894
You can put a bomb in a suitcase. Right?

19:04.935 --> 19:06.228
It's a suitcase bomb.

19:06.270 --> 19:08.773
That's good. A suitcase bomb.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.650
It's a suitcase bomb.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.694
When it's cooking, it's cooking.

19:13.736 --> 19:18.157
We're cooking, and it's
in... it's in... it's in...

19:18.199 --> 19:20.368
Canada. All right?

19:20.409 --> 19:23.287
Albanian terrorists have
placed a suitcase bomb...

19:23.329 --> 19:27.333
...in Canada in an attempt to
infiltrate the bomb into the USA.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.752
That's good.

19:29.794 --> 19:32.838
That's terrific. I'll tell
you why. It is cost effective.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.174
It's producing. That's what it is.

19:35.216 --> 19:37.718
- It's really great.
- I could tell you stories.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.179
Cecil B. De Mille, all right?
The Greatest Show on Earth...

19:40.221 --> 19:42.056
...he needs an elephant.

19:42.098 --> 19:43.349
I got the president on the line.

19:43.391 --> 19:46.685
One minute. Hey, one minute.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.062
De Mille, right?

19:48.104 --> 19:50.898
Needs an elephant for a
reshoot. Know what he does?

19:50.940 --> 19:53.401
Ames here. Yes, sir?

19:53.442 --> 19:55.069
You listening?

19:55.111 --> 19:57.488
- Nobody's listening.
- I'm listening.
- Ok, ok, ok.

19:57.530 --> 20:00.783
- The suitcase bomb.
- Good title for a movie.

20:00.825 --> 20:02.952
Please, write it down.
Don't editorialize.

20:02.993 --> 20:05.371
The thinking is, terrorism.

20:05.413 --> 20:08.833
Act One: Albania denies everything.

20:08.874 --> 20:12.086
The president comes on
the air, "Be calm."

20:12.128 --> 20:13.587
Know what I need right now?

20:13.629 --> 20:17.341
You better get me Johnny Dean,
Liz Butsky, and the Fad King.

20:17.383 --> 20:20.761
Isn't Johnny Dean in the...

20:20.803 --> 20:22.805
Back in Nashville.

20:22.847 --> 20:25.307
- Ok. Act Two.
- We don't need an Act Two.

20:25.349 --> 20:28.477
Don't forget Fad King. We
don't need an Act Two?

20:28.519 --> 20:31.272
We just have to hold their interest
for 11 days till the election.

20:31.313 --> 20:32.606
It's a teaser.

20:32.648 --> 20:35.151
It's a teaser. Absolutely right.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.361
- Grace!
- Yeah.
- Teaser.

20:37.403 --> 20:40.573
They're getting a really good
reaction on the Albanian thing.

20:40.614 --> 20:44.910
Hello, John, you two-bit redneck
shitkicker. How the heck are you?

20:44.952 --> 20:48.330
Get out. Get out.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.127
He's got a new wife.

20:53.169 --> 21:00.301
Right now, he's riding in a pickup
truck with a shotgun and a dog.

21:00.342 --> 21:03.262
Listen, listen. We needed
you here yesterday.

21:03.304 --> 21:06.807
All right? Yes? Come on.
Get your ass out here.

21:06.849 --> 21:09.602
The president wonders about
the possible Albanian backlash.

21:09.643 --> 21:11.729
You can't have a war without an enemy.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.273
We could have one, but it
would be a very dull war.

21:14.315 --> 21:15.983
How long do we need him here for?

21:16.025 --> 21:17.485
We're done in 11 days.

21:17.526 --> 21:19.987
Eleven days, John. We need you.

21:20.029 --> 21:22.364
You want to write a song for us?

21:22.406 --> 21:24.408
Is there gonna be a
back end on this thing?

21:24.450 --> 21:25.284
What?

21:25.326 --> 21:27.161
Is there gonna be a
back end on this thing?

21:27.203 --> 21:29.038
What? Back end?

21:29.079 --> 21:31.081
Yeah. You know.
Percentage points, money.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.750
Yeah, count on it.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.335
Where is the back end coming from?

21:34.376 --> 21:35.336
Lots of cash, John.

21:35.377 --> 21:38.172
- It's like a thing with yellow ribbon.
- Thing with the yellow ribbon?

21:38.214 --> 21:40.841
- Yeah. The hostages.
- Hostages?

21:40.883 --> 21:43.219
They tied the yellow
ribbons around everything.

21:43.260 --> 21:45.346
Yeah. But that was a
naturally occurring...

21:45.387 --> 21:48.641
That was a put-up job?

21:48.682 --> 21:51.977
All right. Grace! Grace!

21:52.019 --> 21:53.312
Yes. What?

21:53.354 --> 21:54.563
Jezz!

21:54.605 --> 21:56.607
I want you to get Johnny a ticket. OK?

21:56.649 --> 21:58.150
- Fad King on two.
- Ok.

21:58.192 --> 22:02.863
He's riding in a pickup truck
right now with a shotgun and a dog.

22:02.905 --> 22:04.156
Are you shitting me?

22:04.198 --> 22:08.160
King, listen, got a thing
here, product placement.

22:08.202 --> 22:11.539
Of course there's a back end.

22:11.580 --> 22:13.874
- It can't be a ribbon.
- What's wrong with a ribbon?

22:13.916 --> 22:15.626
Because, AIDS has the
yellow ribbon thing.

22:15.668 --> 22:16.544
Fuck ribbons.

22:16.585 --> 22:18.837
Look. Canada. Ok? Our
neighbor to the north...

22:18.879 --> 22:21.590
...all of a sudden transformed
into that place from whence...

22:21.632 --> 22:24.051
...like the north wind, terror comes.

22:24.093 --> 22:25.302
I like that. Keep
talking. That's what...

22:25.344 --> 22:27.054
What guards us against Canada?

22:27.096 --> 22:30.558
I guard the Canadian border.

22:30.599 --> 22:32.142
Mounties guard the border. Mountie hats.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.561
Stupid fucking hats.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.104
What? Davy Crockett had a
hat. We may have a fortune.

22:35.145 --> 22:38.232
You could crush them and
put them in your pocket.

22:38.274 --> 22:41.277
You can't put a mountie hat in your pocket.
You need a pocket the size of fucking Detroit.

22:41.318 --> 22:43.571
You see this? This is what producing is.

22:43.612 --> 22:47.366
You put me in a room
with talent... electric.

22:47.408 --> 22:49.618
You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking
armbands. That's what I'm thinking.

22:49.660 --> 22:53.914
- Armbands is good.
- I'm thinking... I'm thinking green. OK? Not like Kelly green.

22:53.956 --> 22:56.834
Last year, the number one selling
color in new cars in America was green.

22:56.875 --> 22:59.044
- People like green.
- Hunter.

22:59.086 --> 23:02.590
Hunter green. Strong, pride, dignity.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.133
But not Kelly green.
You know what I mean?

23:04.174 --> 23:06.719
I like it with a hat.
What if we had a hat...

23:06.760 --> 23:10.431
- Maybe. That could be.
- You see that?

23:10.472 --> 23:14.351
Sit on my lap if you love me...

23:14.393 --> 23:17.938
...but don't put your hand down there.

23:17.980 --> 23:18.772
I didn't mean...

23:18.814 --> 23:21.609
We'll take a short nap.

23:21.650 --> 23:23.777
See, I just thought you should see it.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.195
I don't think it should be a song.

23:25.237 --> 23:28.532
- I'm glad that your mama's not here.
- He misunderstood.

23:28.574 --> 23:31.243
No, no, no. I mean if
you do a song about it.

23:31.285 --> 23:32.494
I just thought it was funny.

23:32.536 --> 23:34.496
Sit on my lap...

23:34.538 --> 23:37.458
I don't think it's appropriate
for what we're doing.

23:37.499 --> 23:39.126
I just meant for you to see it.

23:39.168 --> 23:42.963
I guard the Canadian border.

23:43.005 --> 23:45.132
The president spent the
weekend pressing the flesh.

23:45.174 --> 23:50.429
He wasn't campaigning.
He was dating, actually.

23:50.471 --> 23:53.891
Connie, change this. Thank you.

23:53.932 --> 23:56.769
Behind the mention of Albania,
of his stomach flu...

23:56.810 --> 24:00.022
...taking refuge these scant
days away from the election.

24:00.064 --> 24:01.982
Young girl in rubble.

24:02.024 --> 24:05.235
She was driven from her home
by Albanian terrorists. Ok?

24:05.277 --> 24:08.030
- It is her we are mobilizing to defend.
- Yes.

24:08.072 --> 24:11.033
- Or is it she?
- It is her we are mobilizing.

24:11.075 --> 24:12.534
- Can we get her a kitten?
- Yeah.

24:12.576 --> 24:14.870
Young girl in rubble with a kitten.

24:14.912 --> 24:16.080
Good. That's good.

24:16.121 --> 24:19.458
OK. See. This is too static.

24:19.500 --> 24:22.378
Young girl running from the village.

24:22.419 --> 24:23.504
More energy.

24:23.545 --> 24:25.881
Time to face these terrible charges...

24:25.923 --> 24:29.134
...to answer all of these questions.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.553
- What's this, Stanley?
- It's head shots.

24:31.595 --> 24:36.141
Girls to you know, play the victim
you know, in our news footage.

24:36.183 --> 24:37.267
OK. Write this down.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.770
Young girl running from
village towards camera.

24:39.812 --> 24:42.564
Grainy, hand-held, you
know, news footage.

24:42.606 --> 24:43.941
Send it to everyone.

24:43.982 --> 24:47.861
What do you think of these
people? I like the sorrowful one.

24:47.903 --> 24:49.029
What the hell is this again?

24:49.071 --> 24:52.449
Young Albanian girl
running from her home.

24:52.491 --> 24:53.659
I like this broad right here.

24:53.701 --> 24:56.578
Where? No. Yours is too Texan.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.414
We're locked into Albania. Why?

24:58.455 --> 25:00.541
Albania's hard to rhyme.

25:00.582 --> 25:02.209
What are you looking at me for?

25:02.251 --> 25:05.838
It's the name of the country.

25:05.879 --> 25:08.549
Albanian. Albanian.

25:08.590 --> 25:11.552
That rhymes.

25:11.802 --> 25:14.388
- John Belushi?
- Jim.

25:14.430 --> 25:15.889
Jim Belushi.

25:15.931 --> 25:18.058
- Jim Belushi what?
- Albanian.

25:18.100 --> 25:19.893
Jim Belushi's Albanian?

25:19.935 --> 25:21.270
Sure, it's thing you
know. Are you kidding?

25:21.311 --> 25:24.314
Anybody know who's ever eaten
in an Albanian restaurant?

25:24.356 --> 25:27.443
- Is there such a thing an Albanian restaurant?
- Has to be. They have to eat.

25:27.484 --> 25:31.155
- Is there a national dish?
- No. Nobody would know. We can make it up.

25:31.196 --> 25:35.117
Jim Belushi is Albanian.

25:49.798 --> 25:52.426
What time is it?

25:52.468 --> 25:54.052
3:03.

25:54.094 --> 25:55.429
Great idea.

25:55.471 --> 25:59.099
To the men and women of the
303 detachment with their...

25:59.141 --> 26:00.434
Leopard skin.

26:00.476 --> 26:02.644
With their berets.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.021
How about all black?

26:04.063 --> 26:04.897
That's good.

26:04.938 --> 26:07.441
Half black, half leopard...

26:07.483 --> 26:09.735
...wear it on your head.

26:09.777 --> 26:12.654
Half black, half leopard...

26:12.696 --> 26:16.617
...wear it to your head.

26:18.660 --> 26:22.831
I guard the American dream.

26:25.667 --> 26:29.838
I guard the American dream.

26:39.181 --> 26:41.975
Everybody's always in
a hurry these days.

26:42.017 --> 26:44.144
If they're not rushing somewhere...

26:44.186 --> 26:46.647
...there'll be changing something
that doesn't need changing.

26:46.688 --> 26:50.025
That's why I'm glad we're
standing behind the president.

26:50.067 --> 26:53.403
Sure we are. It just makes good sense.

26:53.445 --> 26:56.031
You don't want to change
horses in midstream.

26:56.073 --> 26:58.450
Why are they sticking with
this age-old horseshit?

26:58.492 --> 27:00.869
Why are they sticking with
the same old garbage?

27:00.911 --> 27:04.832
- Who hires these people?
- I feel insulted just having seen it. You know what I mean?

27:04.873 --> 27:07.042
- It's offensive.
- Poorly costumed.

27:07.084 --> 27:10.754
New York Times, Washington
Post: War. War. War.

27:10.796 --> 27:13.841
Times got the Firefly Girl
in the Style section.

27:13.882 --> 27:16.635
Post on page 12.

27:16.677 --> 27:19.930
It's good. Hello?

27:19.972 --> 27:22.182
It's very important. Listen up, Connie.

27:22.224 --> 27:25.227
It's all war. You're doing good.

27:25.269 --> 27:27.980
Would you vote for that person
based on that commercial?

27:28.021 --> 27:29.439
- You know, I don't vote.
- Why don't you vote?

27:29.481 --> 27:32.526
Last time I vote when that one time Major
League Baseball started the fans voting...

27:32.568 --> 27:34.903
...I voted for Boog Powell on
first base. He didn't get in it...

27:34.945 --> 27:37.072
...and it just disappointed
me. Stayed with me.

27:37.114 --> 27:38.031
It's futile.

27:38.073 --> 27:39.992
You've never voted for president?

27:40.033 --> 27:41.910
No. Do you vote?

27:41.952 --> 27:45.122
No. I always vote for
the Academy Awards...

27:45.163 --> 27:46.039
...but I never win.

27:46.081 --> 27:47.541
Liz, do you vote? Do you vote?

27:47.583 --> 27:49.877
No. I don't vote. I
don't like the rooms.

27:49.918 --> 27:53.130
Too claustrophobic. I
can't vote in small places.

27:53.171 --> 27:58.302
- It's about that time.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

28:04.391 --> 28:08.353
We got the Albanian girl with a
cat, with a kitten, and with a dog.

28:08.395 --> 28:10.564
But I don't want a dog.
I asked for a kitten.

28:10.606 --> 28:13.650
I understand that, but the
pet wrangler suggested...

28:13.692 --> 28:16.737
I think I need to speak to the president
before you decide on the animal.

28:16.778 --> 28:20.115
You don't understand. Can't they
find me a kitten? Listen to me.

28:20.157 --> 28:22.534
Albanian terrorists
have a staging area...

28:22.576 --> 28:24.244
...for their atomic workshop.
That's why she's fleeing.

28:24.286 --> 28:27.539
Listen this. Just follow this. What if it
wasn't Albania? Let's say it was Italy?

28:27.581 --> 28:30.167
I can get a lot of cash if it's Italy.
Listen this concept. "The boot."

28:30.208 --> 28:33.420
"Give them the boot." What
if a shoe was the fad?

28:33.462 --> 28:36.465
OK. The little girl is
coming toward the camera.

28:36.506 --> 28:38.675
What does she have in
her hands? A kitten.

28:38.717 --> 28:39.551
Better.

28:39.593 --> 28:41.136
Albania doesn't do anything for me.

28:41.178 --> 28:42.554
I think that's the problem.

28:42.596 --> 28:46.558
- We're locked into Albania.
- Why is that?

28:46.600 --> 28:49.645
The president's gonna go to war
with Albania in about 30 minutes.

28:49.686 --> 28:51.146
Declaring war on Albania?

28:51.188 --> 28:53.148
No. We're not declaring
war. We're going to war.

28:53.190 --> 28:55.525
We haven't declared
war since World War II.

28:55.567 --> 29:00.739
- We're going to war?
- We're going to war.

29:00.781 --> 29:03.825
This late-breaking news
just in from Air Force One.

29:03.867 --> 29:05.285
The president of the United States...

29:05.327 --> 29:08.789
...has said that he apologizes
for the need for secrecy...

29:08.830 --> 29:10.958
...and he assures that
it is necessary...

29:10.999 --> 29:13.752
...for the safety of the
men and women in combat.

29:13.794 --> 29:15.963
He says that the Republic of Albania...

29:16.004 --> 29:19.633
...long a staging ground for
terrorism around the world.

29:19.675 --> 29:23.679
He has mentioning a state of
war is or is about to happen...

29:23.720 --> 29:26.640
...between the United States
and the Republic of Albania.

29:26.682 --> 29:28.141
How many kittens do we have, Grace?

29:28.183 --> 29:30.811
There ought to be kittens
a-plenty, Stanley. I had a call.

29:30.852 --> 29:34.523
All right, people. Let's get started.

29:34.564 --> 29:35.524
Ok?

29:35.565 --> 29:37.109
Hi.

29:37.150 --> 29:39.569
Hello. My name is Stanley Motss.
I'll be your producer this morning.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.780
What I would like you to do,
Miss... What is your name?

29:41.822 --> 29:42.698
Tracy Lime.

29:42.739 --> 29:45.242
Tracy, stand against that wall,
and on my signal "action"...

29:45.283 --> 29:47.995
...I want you running
toward me, screaming.

29:48.036 --> 29:49.663
- Can we get you anything?
- I'm fine.

29:49.705 --> 29:52.916
How about a cup of tea?
A little milk, low fat?

29:52.958 --> 29:53.959
You Ok?

29:54.001 --> 29:56.169
OK. Fine. Let's just try
one. I wanna we just try.

29:56.211 --> 29:58.547
Is this a national? Is that the case?

29:58.588 --> 30:00.382
- Well, it's a little bit...
- It's a direct buy-out.

30:00.424 --> 30:03.093
Yeah. Why just have your
agent... What the hell is this?

30:03.135 --> 30:05.012
What is this, a menagerie?
I want kittens.

30:05.053 --> 30:06.805
I can't wait to put this on my resume.

30:06.847 --> 30:07.681
I just want kittens.

30:07.723 --> 30:10.434
Tracy, can I talk to
you for a minute please?

30:10.475 --> 30:14.021
This is a special kind of situation.
It's a funny kind of situation.

30:14.062 --> 30:17.065
Well, Sir. We have a schnauzer
and what appears to be...

30:17.107 --> 30:18.358
It's a Lhasa apso.

30:18.400 --> 30:19.735
Lhasa apso?

30:19.776 --> 30:21.361
It couldn't have been simpler. Kittens.

30:21.403 --> 30:25.490
What you got here is basically a cross
between a dog and what a substantially...

30:25.532 --> 30:27.284
No. I don't wanna cross.
I just want kittens.

30:27.325 --> 30:29.870
Absolutely, sir. Absolutely.
The president wants a kitten.

30:29.911 --> 30:31.204
No. I want a kitten.

30:31.246 --> 30:32.039
Well. Get a kitten.

30:32.080 --> 30:35.125
Get rid of all the dogs
and keep the kittens.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.334
Miss. Excuse me.

30:36.376 --> 30:39.421
I'm gonna have to have you sign
this little sheet of paper here.

30:39.463 --> 30:42.049
Well, my agent would be real
real miffed with me if I...

30:42.090 --> 30:43.800
This doesn't have to do with your deal.

30:43.842 --> 30:47.387
This is your security clearance.

30:47.429 --> 30:50.390
Right there.

30:51.183 --> 30:52.851
Nice signature. Thank you, Tracy.

30:52.893 --> 30:56.813
Nice meeting you, Tracy.

30:59.107 --> 31:00.108
This is a nice one.

31:00.150 --> 31:02.652
No, no. But that's not a kitten.
That's a cat. These are kittens.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.279
They just wanted to
give you some options.

31:04.321 --> 31:07.074
Yes, but it's too confusing. That
guy keeps pushing the Lopso opso.

31:07.115 --> 31:08.325
Lhasa apso.

31:08.366 --> 31:10.452
- Things in the mix. We'll do it optically.
- We're gonna do it digitally.

31:10.494 --> 31:12.621
OK. Let's try to shoot one.

31:12.662 --> 31:14.331
- Stacey?
- Tracy.

31:14.372 --> 31:16.833
I want you to stand over right here.

31:16.875 --> 31:19.252
OK? Here you go. Right there.

31:19.294 --> 31:23.381
- These are chips.
- Yeah.

31:24.466 --> 31:25.759
Hold the bag when you run.

31:25.801 --> 31:27.803
We need it for the arm position.
On screen, it'll be a kitten.

31:27.844 --> 31:28.887
Can I hold the kitten?

31:28.929 --> 31:30.847
No. We'll punch it in
later. Right there.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.349
You're gonna punch the kitten later?

31:32.390 --> 31:33.683
- Yes.
- Why?

31:33.725 --> 31:35.560
For a wider set of options.

31:35.602 --> 31:37.938
A wider option of what?

31:37.979 --> 31:40.857
Of kittens.

31:40.982 --> 31:46.071
Sir, all kidding aside, when this goes
national, I get to put it on my resume?

31:46.113 --> 31:47.447
Actually, no.

31:47.489 --> 31:50.909
Because... What is it, a guild
thing or something? I mean...

31:50.951 --> 31:53.286
You can never tell anyone you did this.

31:53.328 --> 31:54.621
What could they do me?

31:54.663 --> 31:57.124
They'd come to your house and kill you.

31:57.165 --> 31:59.292
The president.

31:59.334 --> 32:01.628
Stop the makeup. She's
been raped by terrorists.

32:01.670 --> 32:03.964
- She's not pale enough.
- Jump out, please.

32:04.005 --> 32:05.924
They're starting to shoot now...

32:05.966 --> 32:09.052
...and they're gonna do
the kitten thing optically.

32:09.094 --> 32:10.804
That's right, Mr. President.

32:10.846 --> 32:12.806
I don't know how they do
the kitten optically...

32:12.848 --> 32:17.727
...but they know what they're doing.

32:19.354 --> 32:21.731
Sir, she's not an illegal
immigrant, is she?

32:21.773 --> 32:23.024
Could I see the contract, please?

32:23.066 --> 32:24.818
Why is it so flat?

32:24.860 --> 32:28.363
Because the president cannot
employ an illegal immigrant.

32:28.405 --> 32:30.240
- Let's use more spray.
- Cover up.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.159
Let's keep working people!

32:32.200 --> 32:35.871
Are we getting there?

32:37.205 --> 32:42.169
OK. Good. Put the village behind her.

32:48.675 --> 32:52.095
Gimme some flames.

32:53.972 --> 32:56.349
How about some screaming?

32:56.391 --> 32:57.559
Screaming's good.

32:57.601 --> 33:01.521
Some sound of screaming.

33:03.398 --> 33:07.027
- What might be good is ooh-ahh sirens.
- What the hell is ohh-ahh?

33:07.068 --> 33:08.737
You know. Anne Frank.

33:08.778 --> 33:10.864
OK. That's good.

33:10.906 --> 33:13.074
Find us the Anne Frank sirens.

33:13.116 --> 33:14.659
That's chilling. That's good.

33:14.701 --> 33:17.162
That's giving me goose bumps.

33:17.204 --> 33:20.874
Find us the ooh-ahhs.

33:25.587 --> 33:27.714
We're gonna be back in Washington when?

33:27.756 --> 33:29.257
We'll be back tonight.

33:29.299 --> 33:31.218
Tonight is...

33:31.259 --> 33:34.095
It seems that Senator Neal
has discovered something.

33:34.137 --> 33:36.556
It makes no difference
about Senator Neal.

33:36.598 --> 33:41.811
I don't care what Senator
Neal's got. We got a war.

33:41.853 --> 33:43.480
Look at that girl.

33:43.521 --> 33:44.773
Doesn't she look Albanian?

33:44.814 --> 33:48.652
She looks like she was born
and raised in Albania.

33:48.693 --> 33:51.404
I got an instinct for
casting. Don't ask me why.

33:51.446 --> 33:53.198
OK. We're gonna do it again, sweetie.

33:53.240 --> 33:55.367
- What's her name, Stacey?
- Tracy.

33:55.408 --> 34:00.247
One more time, Tracy. You're
doing fine. You're doing fine.

34:00.288 --> 34:03.708
Could she be running across a bridge?

34:03.750 --> 34:08.797
She's running across a burning bridge.

34:14.261 --> 34:16.763
- That looks good.
- That's beautiful.

34:16.804 --> 34:18.598
Of course, we'll need some water.

34:18.639 --> 34:20.266
Is it a stream?

34:20.308 --> 34:21.643
No, I think...

34:21.685 --> 34:24.020
- A pond?
- No, I think...

34:24.062 --> 34:26.898
I think it's a calico kitten.

34:26.940 --> 34:29.275
She's running across with a kitten.

34:29.317 --> 34:32.070
Can we have a calico kitten? Please.

34:32.112 --> 34:34.864
Floyd, punch in a calico kitten.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.116
I have 19 screens here.

34:36.157 --> 34:37.784
I can't see one calico kitten.

34:37.826 --> 34:44.708
The thinking is as of this moment
a small calico kitten, sir.

34:46.583 --> 34:49.129
- Calico kitten.
- OK.

34:49.170 --> 34:54.592
We have a small calico
kitten, sir. Calico.

34:54.967 --> 34:56.469
- What?
- He wants a white one.

34:56.511 --> 34:59.764
He wants a white one?

34:59.806 --> 35:01.349
Let me talk to him.

35:01.391 --> 35:03.643
He's mobilizing the sixth fleet.

35:03.685 --> 35:05.145
Connie, can I please talk to him?

35:05.186 --> 35:08.523
He's mobilizing the sixth fleet.

35:08.565 --> 35:11.693
I hate it when they start to meddle.

35:11.735 --> 35:13.069
Can we have a white one?

35:13.111 --> 35:16.781
He wants a white one.

35:18.742 --> 35:21.536
Thank you.

35:30.462 --> 35:31.713
Are we ready yet?

35:31.755 --> 35:34.215
How soon you think we will
able to get this cut?

35:34.257 --> 35:36.009
We're gonna be done in 4 or 5 hours.

35:36.051 --> 35:38.928
That's good. We can leak
that to the press...

35:38.970 --> 35:43.141
...they can downlink it on
Tel star 401, transporter 21.

35:43.183 --> 35:47.771
Makes you glad you've lived this long.

35:47.812 --> 35:51.316
This just in newsbreak a special
report from the Albanian front.

35:51.358 --> 35:52.734
We've just received information that...

35:52.776 --> 35:55.904
...the young Albanian national
fleeing in this video...

35:55.945 --> 36:02.911
...is attempting to escape
terrorist reprisals in her village.

36:04.245 --> 36:06.289
America has seldom witnessed...

36:06.331 --> 36:09.167
...a more poignant
picture of the human race.

36:09.209 --> 36:11.544
- Fantastic.
- That was good.

36:11.586 --> 36:12.420
They used the same process...

36:12.462 --> 36:14.130
...with the last Schwarzenegger movie.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.883
- Fantastic.
- Isn't that amazing how they do that?

36:16.925 --> 36:19.552
You know what, Conrad? This
is only the beginning.

36:19.594 --> 36:21.179
Wait till we get the song.

36:21.221 --> 36:24.099
Then you got the song, the image,
the merchandising tie-ins.

36:24.140 --> 36:25.225
You know. This is only the beginning.

36:25.266 --> 36:28.311
- We were right. You're the man.
- You're the man.

36:28.353 --> 36:30.730
- To the beginning.
- To the beginning.
- To the beginning.

36:30.772 --> 36:32.107
Got your car.

36:32.148 --> 36:34.776
I hate it when they
send these long ones.

36:34.818 --> 36:36.903
- Did you make the turn OK?
- Not a problem.

36:36.945 --> 36:39.489
I'm sorry, Conrad. You
think it's too ostentatious?

36:39.531 --> 36:40.824
Just fine. I'll stretch out.

36:40.865 --> 36:43.618
- OK. Good. Just make due.
- OK.

36:43.660 --> 36:47.330
I'll see you in Nashville.

36:47.372 --> 36:49.541
Go to the two-tone hat.

36:49.582 --> 36:52.085
I don't care. You work it out.

36:52.127 --> 36:55.380
You must have had similar
situations in the past.

36:55.422 --> 36:59.300
There are unconfirmed reports at
this time from a reliable source...

36:59.342 --> 37:00.927
...that things are in motion.

37:00.969 --> 37:03.555
What I'm hearing and this is a quote...

37:03.596 --> 37:05.432
"The president is looking for a swift...

37:05.473 --> 37:07.851
...painless, and victorious
conclusion to the war."

37:07.892 --> 37:10.937
However, the source
will not go on record.

37:10.979 --> 37:14.107
All I can tell you is this
comes from the highest level.

37:14.149 --> 37:15.942
New York Times, Washington Post...

37:15.984 --> 37:17.318
...Detroit Register, Sacramento Bee...

37:17.360 --> 37:20.321
...all in remission. No mention
of the Firefly Girl. None.

37:20.363 --> 37:23.074
10 days to go. Big Bird
touches down when?

37:23.116 --> 37:24.617
We bring him tomorrow at 5 a.m.

37:24.659 --> 37:26.161
Anything at the airport?

37:26.202 --> 37:27.912
The press thought no. What do you think?

37:27.954 --> 37:29.789
Here's what I think. Is it gonna rain?

37:29.831 --> 37:32.625
Can you give me the weather
tomorrow morning? Andrews, 5 a.m.?

37:32.667 --> 37:35.211
A young Albanian girl...

37:35.253 --> 37:37.505
...dressed in her... whatever.

37:37.547 --> 37:40.383
Is there some festival
some harvest festival...

37:40.425 --> 37:42.469
...an Albanian harvest
festival, something like that?

37:42.510 --> 37:45.138
Get on this right away. Find me an harvest
festival. Albanian harvest festival.

37:45.180 --> 37:46.431
There's gotta be something.

37:46.473 --> 37:48.641
Anyway, she gives him the
sacred whatever it is...

37:48.683 --> 37:51.436
...telling him this is a
sacred traditional offering...

37:51.478 --> 37:53.938
...given to the man who
ties the first sheaf...

37:53.980 --> 37:56.274
...the last sheaf, who
the fuck knows what sheaf?

37:56.316 --> 37:58.067
This is good. Is she
saying this in Albanian?

37:58.109 --> 37:59.027
She's speaking in Albanian...

37:59.068 --> 38:01.154
...because this is the only
way it can be understood...

38:01.196 --> 38:04.949
...by her sacred,
sainted, and aged mother.

38:04.991 --> 38:07.327
We're picking them up now.

38:07.368 --> 38:10.163
Now the old lady starts to speak.

38:10.205 --> 38:12.040
"You have brought peace
not only to this..."

38:12.081 --> 38:14.459
No, no. The child speaks.

38:14.501 --> 38:16.336
A face of innocence, no cynicism.

38:16.377 --> 38:17.754
The child says...

38:17.795 --> 38:19.214
Are you getting this?

38:19.255 --> 38:22.133
Now, the old broad starts
to break down and cry.

38:22.175 --> 38:24.135
Big Bird shrugs off his secret
service, goes over there...

38:24.177 --> 38:26.471
...covers her with his
own coat, end of story.

38:26.513 --> 38:30.099
Can you find out if there is any chance we could
get some rain at Andrews tomorrow? Thank you.

38:30.141 --> 38:32.018
How is Big Bird holding up by the way?

38:32.060 --> 38:33.228
He's good.

38:33.269 --> 38:36.356
He does want to know... Forget about the
office. What does your fellow Motss want?

38:36.397 --> 38:38.733
I don't know. Ambassador to Togo.

38:38.775 --> 38:42.403
No rain tomorrow at Andrews, but
we do have a rain at Boca Raton.

38:42.445 --> 38:44.239
Then direct the plane to Boca.

38:44.280 --> 38:50.036
OK. Connie says let's
divert the plane to Boca.

38:53.373 --> 38:56.751
What's happening?

39:11.641 --> 39:13.226
Can I help you?

39:13.268 --> 39:15.562
What's the problem?

39:15.603 --> 39:17.188
We're really in a rush here.

39:17.230 --> 39:19.357
Do you know who we are?

39:19.399 --> 39:22.193
I'm afraid that's the
trouble, Miss Ames.

39:22.235 --> 39:24.571
CIA.

39:44.382 --> 39:45.925
What am I gonna do?

39:45.967 --> 39:47.427
I have a three-year-old daughter...

39:47.468 --> 39:49.971
...eventually headed for orthodonture.

39:50.013 --> 39:52.390
Oh, God. Now that the CIA knows,
I'm gonna lose everything...

39:52.432 --> 39:54.434
...my career, my reputation.
What am I gonna do?

39:54.475 --> 39:57.228
Brazen it through.

39:57.270 --> 39:58.479
Took you long enough?

39:58.521 --> 40:00.523
We found them as soon as we could, sir.

40:00.565 --> 40:02.108
All right.

40:02.150 --> 40:05.111
After I'm done with them,
what do they want me to do?

40:05.153 --> 40:07.614
Lug them back to the district
or dump them in the country...

40:07.655 --> 40:09.198
...let the FBI trip over them?

40:09.240 --> 40:11.242
Legal department says you pick.

40:11.284 --> 40:13.244
Depends on what we want to do with them.

40:13.286 --> 40:15.622
This is a newsbreak special
report on the war in Albania.

40:15.663 --> 40:17.248
We've just received more details...

40:17.290 --> 40:19.709
...of the young Albanian girl
seen running for her life.

40:19.751 --> 40:23.087
The young girl was trying to escape
after hearing her family was killed.

40:23.129 --> 40:29.302
Apparently, there was a
family connection in Canada.

40:29.886 --> 40:32.555
Two things I know to be true...

40:32.597 --> 40:35.516
...there's no difference between
good flan and bad flan...

40:35.558 --> 40:37.268
...and there is no war.

40:37.310 --> 40:38.603
Guess who I am.

40:38.645 --> 40:41.439
I would like to point out that
I am under medical care...

40:41.481 --> 40:43.900
...and taking medication, side
effects of which have a little bit...

40:43.941 --> 40:45.652
Quite touching.

40:45.693 --> 40:47.362
I also take this opportunity...

40:47.403 --> 40:50.114
...to suggest that, equally,
I admit to nothing...

40:50.156 --> 40:51.949
...and I would like my lawyer present.

40:51.991 --> 40:53.660
We show, and NSA confirms...

40:53.701 --> 40:56.537
...there are no nuclear
devices on the Canadian border.

40:56.579 --> 40:58.831
There are no nuclear devices in Albania.

40:58.873 --> 41:01.000
Albania has no nuclear capacity.

41:01.042 --> 41:04.754
Our spy satellites show no secret
terrorist training camps...

41:04.796 --> 41:06.714
...in the Albanian hinterland.

41:06.756 --> 41:09.717
The border patrol, the
FBI, the RCMP report...

41:09.759 --> 41:13.346
...no... repeat... no
untoward activity...

41:13.388 --> 41:15.723
...along our picturesque
Canadian border.

41:15.765 --> 41:18.685
The Albanian government
is screaming its defense.

41:18.726 --> 41:20.395
The world is listening.

41:20.436 --> 41:21.896
There is no war.

41:21.938 --> 41:24.357
Of course, there's a war. I'm
watching it on television.

41:24.399 --> 41:26.484
Who might you be? What
you all said and done?

41:26.526 --> 41:28.861
- My name is Conrad Brean.
- Who do you work for?

41:28.903 --> 41:32.240
Nobody whose name you want me to
say, Mr. Young. I promise you.

41:32.281 --> 41:35.451
So well and good, but when
the fit hits the shan...

41:35.493 --> 41:37.036
...somebody has to stay after school.

41:37.078 --> 41:38.538
Who do you suppose that might be?

41:38.579 --> 41:40.873
I don't know what you're talking about.

41:40.915 --> 41:43.376
The spy satellites show it, Mr. Brean.

41:43.418 --> 41:44.711
They show no war.

41:44.752 --> 41:46.462
Then what good are they
if they show no war?

41:46.504 --> 41:49.882
I mean, why we spend a quarter trillion
dollars a year on defense department?

41:49.924 --> 41:51.092
What good are they if they show nothing?

41:51.134 --> 41:52.635
Are they useless or
just broken? Or what?

41:52.677 --> 41:54.554
I would like to point out further...

41:54.595 --> 41:56.431
...that these medications
taken in conjunction...

41:56.472 --> 41:57.932
If there's no threat,
then where are you?

41:57.974 --> 42:00.935
Let me go one more. If there's
no threat, what good are you?

42:00.977 --> 42:02.603
Mr. Brean, you are the threat.

42:02.645 --> 42:04.522
I'm the threat? I am the threat?

42:04.564 --> 42:05.940
What have I been doing
the last 30 years...

42:05.982 --> 42:08.234
...that you haven't been doing.
You wanna me fool in on that?

42:08.276 --> 42:09.861
The last 30 years, Mr. Brean...

42:09.902 --> 42:12.196
...I have been working to ensure
the security of my country.

42:12.238 --> 42:14.907
I'm sure that speaks well
of you and your parents...

42:14.949 --> 42:17.452
...but if forced to choose between
the security of your country...

42:17.493 --> 42:19.662
...and the security of your
job, which would you pick?

42:19.704 --> 42:21.998
While you hesitate,
permit me to suggest...

42:22.039 --> 42:24.709
...that they are one in the
same. Your country and your job.

42:24.751 --> 42:27.170
I'm doing my job, Mr. Brean.
That's what you see me doing.

42:27.211 --> 42:29.839
I'm doing my job, too.

42:29.881 --> 42:32.925
Let me ask you something. Let
me ask you a simple question.

42:32.967 --> 42:35.887
Why do people go to war?
Why they go to war?

42:35.928 --> 42:37.930
- I'll play your silly game.
- OK. Why they go to war?

42:37.972 --> 42:39.265
To ensure their way of life.

42:39.307 --> 42:41.267
- Would you fight to do that?
- I have.

42:41.309 --> 42:43.936
If you went to war again,
who would it be against?

42:43.978 --> 42:46.272
Your ability to fight a
two-ocean war against who?

42:46.314 --> 42:47.482
Sweden and Togo?

42:47.523 --> 42:49.609
That time has passed. It's over.

42:49.650 --> 42:52.445
The war of the future
is nuclear terrorism.

42:52.487 --> 42:54.530
It'll be against a small
group of dissidents...

42:54.572 --> 42:57.492
...who, unbeknownst perhaps to
their own governments, have...

42:57.533 --> 42:59.952
To go to that war, you
have to be prepared.

42:59.994 --> 43:02.371
You gotta be alert. The
public has gotta be alert...

43:02.413 --> 43:04.540
...because that is the
war of the future...

43:04.582 --> 43:07.335
...and if you're not gearing
up to fight that war...

43:07.376 --> 43:09.545
...then eventually the ax will
fall. You'll be out in the street.

43:09.587 --> 43:12.715
You can call this a drill,
call this job security...

43:12.757 --> 43:15.134
...call it anything you
like, but I got one for you.

43:15.176 --> 43:16.803
You go to war to preserve
your way of life.

43:16.844 --> 43:19.972
Chuck, this is your way of life.

43:20.014 --> 43:22.141
And if your spy satellites
don't see nothing...

43:22.183 --> 43:23.726
...if there ain't no war...

43:23.768 --> 43:26.813
...then you can go home and
take up golf my friend...

43:26.854 --> 43:31.901
...'cause there ain't no war but ours.

43:33.694 --> 43:35.780
Thank you.

43:35.822 --> 43:40.159
- Drive carefully.
- Bye bye.

43:46.207 --> 43:47.458
Nice enough people.

43:47.500 --> 43:49.043
They just hadn't thought it through.

43:49.085 --> 43:50.962
You talked us out of there.

43:51.003 --> 43:53.214
No, no. We just got delayed.
We're going to Nashville.

43:53.256 --> 43:54.423
What?

43:54.465 --> 43:56.384
I said you could talk
a dog off a meat truck.

43:56.425 --> 43:58.135
Thank you.

43:58.177 --> 43:59.637
No, no, no. We just got stuck. It's ok.

43:59.679 --> 44:02.348
All systems five-by-five.
See you in Nashville.

44:02.390 --> 44:04.100
You saved our bacon.

44:04.141 --> 44:08.771
It was just a phenomenal performance.

44:08.813 --> 44:11.941
You turned them around. You
turned them around like a...

44:11.983 --> 44:16.863
They just hadn't thought it through.

44:20.491 --> 44:24.871
He's moving across the tarmac.

44:25.788 --> 44:28.833
But it appears something has
distracted the president...

44:28.875 --> 44:31.419
...and he has stopped moving
toward the waiting motorcade.

44:31.460 --> 44:33.212
I appears there's a little girl...

44:33.254 --> 44:35.131
...trying to speak to the president.

44:35.172 --> 44:38.426
It seems she's speaking
in... Is it Albanian?

44:38.467 --> 44:41.762
Can we get someone to translate?

44:41.804 --> 44:44.056
Dan, I think what she is saying...

44:44.098 --> 44:48.060
...is that this wheat offering
is sort of ceremonial...

44:48.102 --> 44:50.646
...and that it is the first sheaf...

44:50.688 --> 44:52.231
...the first cut of the harvest.

44:52.273 --> 44:54.358
I'm not proficient in Albanian...

44:54.400 --> 44:56.068
...but the old woman is quite taken...

44:56.110 --> 44:58.362
...as the president is
offering her the coat.

44:58.404 --> 45:01.032
It is quite an emotional moment here.

46:58.399 --> 47:00.526
I loved the fat, wet Albanian broad.

47:00.568 --> 47:01.736
Thank you.

47:01.777 --> 47:03.529
You know why? It was understated.

47:03.571 --> 47:05.364
You got lucky with the rain, too.

47:05.406 --> 47:07.742
We had to divert the
plane to Boca Raton.

47:07.783 --> 47:10.036
You should have come to
me. We have rain machines.

47:10.077 --> 47:11.620
I'm a producer. I make rain.

47:11.662 --> 47:13.914
Next time.

47:13.956 --> 47:15.541
I have just gotten word...

47:15.583 --> 47:18.961
...that the situation in
Albania is resolved...

47:19.003 --> 47:21.213
...that it is resolved.

47:21.255 --> 47:22.923
The CIA confirms...

47:22.965 --> 47:25.885
...that our troops along
the Canadian border...

47:25.926 --> 47:29.930
...and overseas are standing down.

47:29.972 --> 47:34.060
I must take this opportunity to
call upon our president to say...

47:34.101 --> 47:36.270
What does he mean, the
situation has been resolved?

47:36.312 --> 47:38.105
He just ended the war.

47:38.147 --> 47:39.523
He ended the war?

47:39.565 --> 47:40.566
Why did he have to do that?

47:40.608 --> 47:42.234
I think the CIA has
just cut a better deal.

47:42.276 --> 47:45.654
He ended the war?

47:46.405 --> 47:48.074
He can't end the war.

47:48.115 --> 47:52.036
He's not producing this.

47:53.454 --> 47:55.414
This is in bad taste.

47:55.456 --> 47:58.834
Can we stop this?

47:59.460 --> 48:02.421
Stop. It's over.

48:02.463 --> 48:04.673
Can we stop this? Can we stop this?

48:04.715 --> 48:07.802
Stop the choir.

48:07.843 --> 48:09.345
It has been quite a week, Richard.

48:09.386 --> 48:11.764
I can't remember when any
president of United States...

48:11.806 --> 48:13.557
...was hit with the flu, a war...

48:13.599 --> 48:16.268
...and accused of sexual
misconduct by a teenage girl...

48:16.310 --> 48:17.603
...all in the same seven-day period.

48:17.645 --> 48:21.315
This, of course, only days
before he runs for reelection.

48:21.357 --> 48:24.026
We've just received information
from sources at the CIA...

48:24.068 --> 48:26.946
...that confirms the
cessation of hostilities...

48:26.987 --> 48:29.615
The CIA.

48:31.492 --> 48:33.452
I thought they let us out too easily.

48:33.494 --> 48:35.371
The war's over.

48:35.412 --> 48:37.456
It's over. I saw it on television.

48:37.498 --> 48:38.749
I have to sell my house.

48:38.791 --> 48:40.209
The war is not over.

48:40.251 --> 48:43.295
No. The war is not over. I saw it on TV.

48:43.337 --> 48:46.132
That's what you hired me for.

48:46.173 --> 48:48.634
The war isn't over until
I say it's over. Ok?

48:48.676 --> 48:51.011
This is my picture. This
is not the CIA's picture.

48:51.053 --> 48:54.014
You think you're in a tight spot now.

48:54.056 --> 48:56.809
All right, Conrad. Try making The
Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

48:56.851 --> 48:58.811
- Tell it to him, King.
- Three of the horsemen died.

48:58.853 --> 49:01.647
Hear what he's saying? Three
of the horsemen died...

49:01.689 --> 49:03.899
...two weeks before the end
of principal photography.

49:03.941 --> 49:06.235
This is nothing. This is nothing.

49:06.277 --> 49:10.072
This is just Act One, "The War."

49:10.114 --> 49:13.534
Now, we really do need
an Act Two, so we work.

49:13.576 --> 49:14.827
Act Two.

49:14.869 --> 49:16.203
- You know what it's like?
- What?

49:16.245 --> 49:18.164
The Japanese. In the caves.

49:18.205 --> 49:20.040
- Go on.
- Okinawa.

49:20.082 --> 49:22.084
They didn't believe the war was over.

49:22.126 --> 49:24.170
That's right. So, now we have
a guy who doesn't believe...

49:24.211 --> 49:26.338
No, no. We have an American serviceman.

49:26.380 --> 49:29.425
A brave American
serviceman is left behind.

49:29.466 --> 49:31.427
A hero.

49:31.468 --> 49:33.721
Oh, my God. I can't believe
it. What was I thinking?

49:33.762 --> 49:35.514
We had a war. We forgot the hero.

49:35.556 --> 49:38.309
You can't have a war
and not have a hero.

49:38.350 --> 49:39.852
It's like we sent a Christmas card...

49:39.894 --> 49:41.187
...and left out the...
What do you call it?

49:41.228 --> 49:42.354
- Fruitcake.
- There you go.

49:42.396 --> 49:44.648
All right. Let's work. Ok?

49:44.690 --> 49:46.901
We got a guy who's left behind, so...

49:46.942 --> 49:49.528
This is terrific. This
is lucky this happened.

49:49.570 --> 49:51.530
He was left behind,
who just discarded...

49:51.572 --> 49:54.658
...like an old shoe.

49:54.700 --> 49:56.160
That's good. That's good.

49:56.202 --> 49:57.786
What's good? What did I say?

49:57.828 --> 49:59.038
- Shoe.
- Old shoe?

49:59.079 --> 50:02.208
It's just instinct.

50:02.249 --> 50:04.418
I want you to give me the Pentagon...

50:04.460 --> 50:08.130
...a list of people in all
military special programs.

50:08.172 --> 50:11.300
"Left behind like an
old shoe." That is good.

50:11.342 --> 50:15.346
I want to talk to Johnny.

50:17.097 --> 50:18.349
Yeah... What is it?

50:18.390 --> 50:21.227
The war is over. Ok?

50:21.268 --> 50:23.562
Now, we're going to need a new song.

50:23.604 --> 50:26.899
I think, it should be a song
about a shoe, a shiny shoe...

50:26.941 --> 50:28.859
...a black patent shoe...

50:28.901 --> 50:30.736
...a good old shoe.

50:30.778 --> 50:33.530
I was just on my way to get drunk.

50:33.572 --> 50:37.618
Yes, you get drunk, John. But I need
a new song, ok? A good old shoe song.

50:37.660 --> 50:40.412
It should be a ballad of loss and...

50:40.454 --> 50:42.122
- You wanna to help me?
- Redemption.

50:42.164 --> 50:45.793
Loss and redemption is very very good.

50:45.834 --> 50:48.963
Shit. What key do you want it in?

50:49.004 --> 50:51.632
I don't know keys.

50:51.674 --> 50:55.761
I got a lot of people here are
depressed because the war just ended.

50:55.803 --> 50:57.638
Please give me a new song.

50:57.680 --> 50:59.598
All right. I got him on the phone.

50:59.640 --> 51:01.976
- King? - Yeah.
- Pentagon.

51:02.017 --> 51:03.227
Take it.

51:03.269 --> 51:07.106
I need a list of military
special programs.

51:07.147 --> 51:09.316
Bottom of the ninth. All right?

51:09.358 --> 51:12.319
They don't know who
they're playing with.

51:12.361 --> 51:14.780
They don't shut down our picture.

51:14.822 --> 51:16.407
You people gonna be long?

51:16.448 --> 51:18.492
Otherwise, I'll put away the equipment.

51:18.534 --> 51:19.702
I don't know what I'm doing.

51:19.743 --> 51:21.620
I think I'm supposed
to be writing a song.

51:21.662 --> 51:23.914
Writing a song? What kind of song?

51:23.956 --> 51:28.127
Is there anybody there named Schumann?

51:28.168 --> 51:30.546
- Schuster?
- Schumacher.

51:30.587 --> 51:32.965
I got a great idea.

51:33.007 --> 51:37.219
Johnny, I got an idea.
Old shoe, new shoe. OK?

51:37.261 --> 51:40.806
Daddy had a hound dog...

51:40.848 --> 51:44.852
...used to call him Blue.

51:45.352 --> 51:47.855
Follow me 'round...

51:47.896 --> 51:51.900
...stick to me like glue.

51:54.695 --> 51:57.489
His favorite thing to play with...

51:57.531 --> 51:59.908
...used to be a good ol' shoe.

51:59.950 --> 52:01.660
Wait a minute. Used to be.

52:01.702 --> 52:03.537
See, you hit that 16-16.

52:03.579 --> 52:06.749
Well, I wish I had a woman...

52:06.790 --> 52:11.420
...who was half as good and true.

52:11.879 --> 52:14.381
Anybody here know Morse code?

52:14.423 --> 52:15.716
What you gonna do Morse code?

52:15.758 --> 52:18.218
Give me the fax.

52:18.260 --> 52:20.262
Sergeant William Schumann, U.S. Army...

52:20.304 --> 52:24.558
...serial number 2131284262.

52:25.476 --> 52:26.894
Good ol' shoe.

52:26.935 --> 52:29.563
Here's the deal.

52:29.605 --> 52:33.734
Good Ol' Shoe. Good Ol' Shoe.

52:33.776 --> 52:35.527
Whatever you walk in...

52:35.569 --> 52:37.488
...he will get you through.

52:37.529 --> 52:40.032
He's in a sweater...

52:40.074 --> 52:41.742
...and he's...

52:41.784 --> 52:44.828
We drop him behind enemy lines.

52:44.870 --> 52:46.413
He's trapped.

52:46.455 --> 52:47.915
The sweater.

52:47.956 --> 52:51.043
- In the sweater.
- Good.

52:51.085 --> 52:55.839
Is there a way we can make
it sound old and scratchy...

52:55.881 --> 52:59.635
...with, like, a hiss?

53:02.805 --> 53:04.056
With an old label.

53:04.098 --> 53:08.894
I see where you're going with this.

53:11.271 --> 53:13.440
Stand up straight and tall...

53:13.482 --> 53:15.692
...the way he taught you to.

53:15.734 --> 53:18.821
I'll write a speech.

53:18.862 --> 53:20.906
I'll help you with the speech.

53:20.948 --> 53:26.036
The president reveals
that William Schumann...

53:26.078 --> 53:29.415
...was trapped behind enemy lines.

53:29.456 --> 53:31.583
This is good.

53:31.625 --> 53:33.293
Heartfelt.

53:33.335 --> 53:35.921
- Touching.
- Touching.

53:35.963 --> 53:38.340
People will weep.

53:38.382 --> 53:42.302
Soul of a good ol' shoe.

53:43.679 --> 53:45.931
He might even get to heaven...

53:45.973 --> 53:50.853
...on the soul of his good ol' shoe.

53:56.275 --> 53:58.569
All right, here's the
speech. President's speech.

53:58.610 --> 54:00.529
Put this in the Library
of Congress right away.

54:00.571 --> 54:02.114
Folk music section, 1930.

54:02.156 --> 54:04.032
Right away, please.

54:04.074 --> 54:08.579
Get it in the Library of Congress now.

54:08.620 --> 54:10.831
Oh, God.

54:10.873 --> 54:14.042
Who's seeing the guy
from the CBS tonight?

54:14.084 --> 54:17.463
Tonight, you remember some song
from the folk song days...

54:17.504 --> 54:18.839
...something about a good old shoe.

54:18.881 --> 54:20.132
Tonight?

54:20.174 --> 54:22.968
You're with him watching
the president's speech...

54:23.010 --> 54:24.344
What if he's busy tonight?

54:24.386 --> 54:27.014
- Lure him.
- What are you saying?

54:27.055 --> 54:30.142
What I am saying is I don't have
to be your confessor, darling.

54:30.184 --> 54:33.270
Tell him you've got some info on
the president's sex scandal...

54:33.312 --> 54:34.188
...it's on your conscience.

54:34.229 --> 54:36.857
Believe me. He'll drop
whatever he's doing.

54:36.899 --> 54:38.984
Folks, folks, this is a shitty business.

54:39.026 --> 54:41.028
It needs no ghost comes from
the grave to tell us that...

54:41.069 --> 54:43.530
...but, Lord willing,
eight days from now...

54:43.572 --> 54:46.241
...I'm gonna be taking
you into the second term.

54:46.283 --> 54:47.659
Wait till you hear the speech tonight.

54:47.701 --> 54:49.661
The 303 speech. Great.

54:49.703 --> 54:51.538
Where's that Fad King by the way?

54:51.580 --> 54:52.498
I'll get him.

54:52.539 --> 54:54.041
Could we go now please people?

54:54.082 --> 54:56.460
A good plan today is better
than a perfect plan tomorrow.

54:56.502 --> 54:59.171
Conrad, how are they doing
on Sergeant Schumann?

54:59.213 --> 55:00.714
They're working on him,
they're finding him.

55:00.756 --> 55:02.341
Good. It's working.

55:02.382 --> 55:04.927
It's all happening people.
It's taking place around us.

55:04.968 --> 55:08.722
People, it is in the works.
It is being addressed.

55:08.764 --> 55:10.057
We are being proactive.

55:10.098 --> 55:13.227
We are going out tonight with
what may be the finest example...

55:13.268 --> 55:15.979
Get me an update on
the army, the Pentagon.

55:16.021 --> 55:17.523
Get this guy Schumann. Put him on hold.

55:17.564 --> 55:18.941
Have him standing by.

55:18.982 --> 55:23.237
People I gotta tell you, I
see a lot of glum faces now.

55:23.278 --> 55:24.905
Please don't be disconsolate.

55:24.947 --> 55:28.158
This is politics at its finest.

55:28.200 --> 55:30.410
This is where the rubber meets the road.

55:30.452 --> 55:33.413
Now I'm gonna tell that we've
got a leader going out tonight...

55:33.455 --> 55:35.123
...to 95 million American homes.

55:35.165 --> 55:36.917
He's gonna turn this thing around.

55:36.959 --> 55:38.710
You think this is tough?

55:38.752 --> 55:41.547
I was 4 months into production
on The Song of Solomon...

55:41.588 --> 55:43.215
...found out I didn't have the rights.

55:43.257 --> 55:44.841
Turn it up. It's our spot.

55:44.883 --> 55:48.178
Tough? This is nothing.

55:48.220 --> 55:52.391
Will you look at that shit?

55:52.599 --> 55:57.229
'Cause you don't change
horses in midstream.

55:57.271 --> 55:59.731
Don't change horses.

55:59.773 --> 56:01.149
This speech is good.

56:01.191 --> 56:05.028
I mean, we're kinda locked
into it, Mr. President.

56:05.070 --> 56:07.114
For the future of our families...

56:07.155 --> 56:11.952
The music. Where did they get that?

56:13.287 --> 56:17.833
- Pain in the ass.
- What? What? What?

56:17.874 --> 56:20.460
- He won't do it.
- What do you mean he won't do it?
- He won't do the speech.

56:20.502 --> 56:22.796
- What do you mean he won't do it?
- He won't do the speech.

56:22.838 --> 56:24.423
What do you mean? What
choice does he have?

56:24.464 --> 56:26.925
What do you mean he won't do the
speech? He won't do our speech?

56:26.967 --> 56:28.093
He says it's corny.

56:28.135 --> 56:31.763
It's what? It's corny? Corny?

56:31.805 --> 56:33.098
Of course it's corny.

56:33.140 --> 56:35.434
We wouldn't have him say
it if it wasn't corny.

56:35.475 --> 56:37.019
It's not a question.

56:37.060 --> 56:38.729
This is the center
for rest of the thing.

56:38.770 --> 56:40.272
Don't tell me it's corny.

56:40.314 --> 56:42.441
We're locked into the speech, right?

56:42.482 --> 56:43.650
We're locked in.

56:43.692 --> 56:45.611
We are playing way past this.

56:45.652 --> 56:47.738
We are past this. OK.

56:47.779 --> 56:48.739
Corny.

56:48.780 --> 56:50.449
This is what I need.

56:50.490 --> 56:54.119
I want you to get me 30 secretaries
and put them in an office now.

56:54.161 --> 56:56.038
Would you do that? You just
tell him I'm coming up.

56:56.079 --> 56:59.041
I need to see the president
and five minutes of this time.

56:59.082 --> 57:01.084
Speech is corny. Know
what this reminds me of?

57:01.126 --> 57:04.046
Years ago, when I first
went out to Hollywood...

57:04.087 --> 57:05.380
...they said to me,
"It's too theatrical."

57:05.422 --> 57:08.258
You know I was from the theater. So, everything
was over their heads. It's too theatrical.

57:08.300 --> 57:09.968
Not theatrical. He
thinks it's too corny.

57:10.010 --> 57:11.595
Don't tell me the speech is corny.

57:11.637 --> 57:13.180
Just tell him I'm comin'
up. I'm coming up.

57:13.221 --> 57:17.142
My fellow Americans, I
thank a merciful God...

57:17.184 --> 57:19.936
...and I am sure each
and every one of us...

57:19.978 --> 57:22.022
...will thank that Supreme Power...

57:22.064 --> 57:25.150
...whatever we conceive
that power to be...

57:25.192 --> 57:28.195
...that peace is at hand.

57:28.236 --> 57:31.448
The threat of nuclear
terrorism has been quelled.

57:31.490 --> 57:34.660
Mr. President, I'm using a
little more projection...

57:34.701 --> 57:40.165
...because I think this speech
needs a little bit a "umph".

57:40.207 --> 57:43.251
Bear with me.

57:45.671 --> 57:49.091
Thank you so much.

57:59.601 --> 58:01.770
That was so moving.

58:01.812 --> 58:03.188
Thank you so much.

58:03.230 --> 58:06.024
Thank you.

58:10.529 --> 58:13.949
You konow, Connie? I felt
very much at home in there.

58:13.990 --> 58:15.534
Simple quirk of fate.

58:15.575 --> 58:17.160
I could have gone this way.

58:17.202 --> 58:19.204
It's all a change in wardrobe.

58:19.246 --> 58:21.206
So, what do you think? Was it too much?

58:21.248 --> 58:24.334
I'll tell you, Stanley.

58:24.376 --> 58:26.545
- You did it.
- Yeah.

58:26.586 --> 58:27.921
You did it. You jumped in there...

58:27.963 --> 58:29.840
...and saved the thing when
the thing needed saving.

58:29.881 --> 58:31.842
You don't think it was too much?

58:31.883 --> 58:33.760
Personally?

58:33.802 --> 58:35.053
Maybe it was.

58:35.095 --> 58:38.223
Of course the president doesn't
have to say it that way, Connie.

58:38.265 --> 58:40.225
It's like Plato once said.

58:40.267 --> 58:42.728
It doesn't matter how the fuck you
get there as long as you get there.

58:42.769 --> 58:44.229
He said that?

58:44.271 --> 58:46.523
Connie, what is it exactly
you do for the president?

58:46.565 --> 58:49.568
My fellow Americans, I
thank a merciful God...

58:49.609 --> 58:53.572
...and I'm sure all of us will
thank that Supreme Power...

58:53.613 --> 58:56.241
...whatever we conceive
that power to be...

58:56.283 --> 59:00.287
...that peace is at hand.

59:03.540 --> 59:06.877
The threat of nuclear
terrorism has been quelled.

59:06.918 --> 59:09.921
We are in contact with
the Albanian premier...

59:09.963 --> 59:11.423
...who assures me and...

59:11.465 --> 59:13.717
...this government
credits his assurances...

59:13.759 --> 59:16.261
...that his country
does not wish us ill.

59:16.303 --> 59:17.554
Know any Latin?

59:17.596 --> 59:19.139
I, Claudius. That's what I know.

59:19.181 --> 59:22.642
I need a Latin motto for the patch.

59:22.684 --> 59:24.352
The 303 patch.

59:24.394 --> 59:28.106
...by a designation number, 303.

59:28.148 --> 59:32.319
A member of the group was left
behind, what were then, enemy lines.

59:32.360 --> 59:37.073
And I can only say to those
family members of Group 303...

59:37.115 --> 59:39.367
...whose members are,
I know as I speak...

59:39.409 --> 59:40.786
...gathering to comfort you.

59:40.827 --> 59:42.579
To the parents of the missing man...

59:42.621 --> 59:45.123
...I can only say no
effort will be spared...

59:45.165 --> 59:48.752
...to find this brave
man and bring him home.

59:48.794 --> 59:52.297
We've just received this photograph
of Schumann in captivity...

59:52.339 --> 59:55.592
...held by a dissident group
of Albanian terrorists.

59:55.634 --> 59:58.637
Now, I don't know how many of you
are familiar with Morse code...

59:58.678 --> 01:00:02.891
...but could you bring the
camera closer and here, please?

01:00:02.933 --> 01:00:05.644
You'll see his sweater is worn.

01:00:05.685 --> 01:00:07.145
It has been unraveled in places.

01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:09.898
And those places form dashes and dots...

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:14.820
...and those dots spell out
a message in Morse code.

01:00:14.861 --> 01:00:18.406
That message is, "Courage, Mom."

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:20.033
"Courage, Mom."

01:00:20.075 --> 01:00:23.662
He got the message
through. "Courage, Mom."

01:00:23.703 --> 01:00:25.455
Not bad for government work.

01:00:25.497 --> 01:00:27.165
Having a good time?

01:00:27.207 --> 01:00:29.459
Haven't had this much fun since live TV.

01:00:29.501 --> 01:00:32.170
To the men and women of Unit 303...

01:00:32.212 --> 01:00:34.631
...to my fellow citizens,
I say, "Courage, Mom."

01:00:34.673 --> 01:00:38.635
I have informed the Albanian
government that we will not rest...

01:00:38.677 --> 01:00:40.554
...until the safe return
of Sergeant Schumann.

01:00:40.595 --> 01:00:44.683
I'm told his unit mates gave
him the nickname "Old Shoe."

01:00:44.724 --> 01:00:48.854
Wasn't there a folk
song called "Old Shoe?"

01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:51.940
Do you remember that? Something like...

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:56.111
I don't know. I can vaguely remember it.

01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:57.571
Do you know what I'm talking about?

01:00:57.612 --> 01:00:59.531
"Old Shoe."

01:00:59.573 --> 01:01:01.241
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

01:01:01.283 --> 01:01:03.368
Good night and God bless.

01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:08.081
Trump that, Senator Neal, you
Howdy-Doody-looking vontz.

01:01:08.123 --> 01:01:10.667
As we reported earlier, U.S.
Serviceman Willie Schumann...

01:01:10.709 --> 01:01:12.544
...remains missing behind enemy lines...

01:01:12.586 --> 01:01:15.213
It's all thinking ahead.

01:01:15.255 --> 01:01:16.756
That's what producing is.

01:01:16.798 --> 01:01:19.718
- It's like being a plumber.
- Yes. It's like being a plumber.

01:01:19.759 --> 01:01:22.387
Do your job right, nobody should notice.

01:01:22.429 --> 01:01:25.348
When you fuck up, everything
gets full of shit.

01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:27.392
...symbol of the military team...

01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:30.061
...Sergeant William
Schumann, the "Old Shoe."

01:01:30.103 --> 01:01:32.898
What do you say, we line up the
president for the Peace Prize?

01:01:32.939 --> 01:01:34.733
Our job ends on election day.

01:01:34.774 --> 01:01:38.069
Yes. But, come on.

01:01:38.111 --> 01:01:39.738
Just for the symmetry of the thing?

01:01:39.779 --> 01:01:40.739
That's right.

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:42.741
If Kissinger can win the Peace Prize...

01:01:42.782 --> 01:01:46.119
...I wouldn't be surprised to wake up
and find out I'd won the Preakness.

01:01:46.161 --> 01:01:49.789
Well, yes, but our guy did bring peace.

01:01:49.831 --> 01:01:51.249
Yeah, but there wasn't a war.

01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:55.754
All the greater accomplishment.

01:02:10.977 --> 01:02:13.438
Where's the money...

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.441
Where's the tie-in with
throwing away the old shoes?

01:02:16.483 --> 01:02:18.068
Who steps up and pays you for that?

01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:20.320
You throw away the shoes.
What are you gonna do?

01:02:20.362 --> 01:02:21.821
Buy new ones.

01:02:21.863 --> 01:02:24.115
We have some powerful new friends...

01:02:24.157 --> 01:02:27.160
...at the International
Association of Shoe Manufacturers.

01:02:27.202 --> 01:02:28.828
See. You guys sure get around.

01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:30.956
Fad King is my hero. Want to go first?

01:02:30.997 --> 01:02:33.416
Sure.

01:02:35.377 --> 01:02:38.672
History, Connie.

01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:40.840
Those are ratty shoes.

01:02:40.882 --> 01:02:42.884
Yeah, that's why we're
flinging them away.

01:02:42.926 --> 01:02:47.389
You want to try some? Go ahead.

01:02:47.555 --> 01:02:49.474
Here. Do it again.

01:02:49.516 --> 01:02:53.269
Go ahead. Have a ball.

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:57.983
Ok. Watch this.

01:03:00.068 --> 01:03:04.072
Go on, tell your friends.

01:03:04.489 --> 01:03:06.241
Well. This is interesting.

01:03:06.282 --> 01:03:10.495
I have just been handed this.
Something just discovered.

01:03:10.537 --> 01:03:13.832
A 1930s recording, part of
the folk song collection...

01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:15.500
...of the Library of Congress...

01:03:15.542 --> 01:03:18.753
...and a fitting song, if
I may say so, about Shoe.

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:20.630
You know Schumann is
the military soldier...

01:03:20.672 --> 01:03:25.885
...who's been left behind enemy lines...

01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:33.018
Jim, can I get a word with you, please?

01:03:33.059 --> 01:03:36.730
Would you like to comment
the situation on Albania?

01:03:36.771 --> 01:03:39.149
Yes, there is one thing I'd like to say.

01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:43.236
This is to the Albanians that
have this man in custody.

01:03:43.278 --> 01:03:49.701
I mean this from the bottom of
my heart as one of your race.

01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:54.873
I didn't know Jim Belushi was Albanian.

01:03:57.959 --> 01:04:03.381
The search for Willie
Schumann continues...

01:04:29.783 --> 01:04:32.577
Tell Grace, as soon as we
land, I want a reflexologist.

01:04:32.619 --> 01:04:33.536
Male or female?

01:04:33.578 --> 01:04:35.205
- The Polish...
- The White House wants to know about...

01:04:35.246 --> 01:04:36.539
...the Congressional Medal of Honor.

01:04:36.581 --> 01:04:38.083
- What about it?
- For Schumann.

01:04:38.124 --> 01:04:40.752
Wait a minute, wait.
We got 86% in favor.

01:04:40.794 --> 01:04:44.047
We bring him back tomorrow,
charts go up, they don't go down.

01:04:44.089 --> 01:04:45.799
I don't want to tell them
how to do their business...

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:47.550
...but why don't they do
it after the election?

01:04:47.592 --> 01:04:49.511
Makes more sense, and
it'll help them more.

01:04:49.552 --> 01:04:51.554
When are you bringing
him back? Schumann?

01:04:51.596 --> 01:04:53.556
King, show him the thing.

01:04:53.598 --> 01:04:56.351
- It's not done yet. I don't wanna show him.
- Show it to him.

01:04:56.392 --> 01:04:59.104
Talk about enlarging the
market. Tell him, Faye.

01:04:59.145 --> 01:05:02.774
Here it is. Artist's
rendering of the memorial.

01:05:02.816 --> 01:05:04.067
The memorial?

01:05:04.109 --> 01:05:06.611
That's the memorial of the fallen.

01:05:06.653 --> 01:05:08.321
Of the Albanian campaign.

01:05:08.363 --> 01:05:10.115
- Lovely.
- It's better than lovely.

01:05:10.156 --> 01:05:12.242
This guy made a deal
with Governor Kneehigh...

01:05:12.283 --> 01:05:13.910
- Senator Leahy.
- Right.

01:05:13.952 --> 01:05:16.454
Connie, you have to see how much
granite you have to put in this thing.

01:05:16.496 --> 01:05:18.289
We got a site picked out and everything.

01:05:18.331 --> 01:05:20.458
And, the beauty part is...

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.293
...guess who retains the
merchandising rights.

01:05:22.335 --> 01:05:24.129
- Show him the clock?
- Show him.

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:26.089
Got it as a clock.

01:05:26.131 --> 01:05:27.674
Lovely.

01:05:27.715 --> 01:05:29.843
- We gotta get going.
- When's Schumann coming back?

01:05:29.884 --> 01:05:30.677
Getting him right now.

01:05:30.718 --> 01:05:33.513
- I need his neck size.
- You gotta get his neck size.

01:05:33.555 --> 01:05:34.806
I think it may be about 17 1/2.

01:05:34.848 --> 01:05:37.642
You know, 17 1/2, thinking
is not good enough.

01:05:37.684 --> 01:05:39.727
I'm an artist, not a factory worker.

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:42.147
What did he eat behind enemy
lines when he's trapped?

01:05:42.188 --> 01:05:43.690
Birds, snakes.

01:05:43.731 --> 01:05:46.484
Bullshit. He ate tiny
cheeseburgers in tin foil.

01:05:46.526 --> 01:05:47.986
Pull a string, they heat themselves, ok?

01:05:48.027 --> 01:05:49.863
We call Burger King, Johnny Rockets.

01:05:49.904 --> 01:05:52.282
We get the Shoe Burger with
cheese and 303 sauce...

01:05:52.323 --> 01:05:54.742
"Behind enemy lines or anytime."

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:56.077
- Good.
- Good? That's good.

01:05:56.119 --> 01:05:56.953
That's the slogan.

01:05:56.995 --> 01:05:59.664
And I got the copyright on
the Albanian kitten thing.

01:05:59.706 --> 01:06:01.749
I'm gonna call Nike, get Rodman
to dye his hair leopard skin.

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:06.838
We'll have a sneaker... "Air Leopard."

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:09.549
...a high school basketball
game last night...

01:06:09.591 --> 01:06:11.926
...between Montgomery
Bell and Blair Park.

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:13.428
Students, during the game...

01:06:13.469 --> 01:06:16.139
...in spontaneous moment
of sheer patriotism...

01:06:16.181 --> 01:06:19.517
...threw their tennis shoes on
the court by the hundreds...

01:06:19.559 --> 01:06:21.102
...just for the Old Shoe.

01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:23.855
Bring him back. William
Schumann, soldier...

01:06:23.897 --> 01:06:25.732
There's no business like it.

01:06:25.773 --> 01:06:28.443
Demonstrations are springing
up all over the country...

01:06:28.484 --> 01:06:31.487
...as American people continue
to show their patriotism.

01:06:31.529 --> 01:06:34.449
You ought to get them to run
that inaugural speech by me.

01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:36.534
Inaugural speech? I don't know.

01:06:36.576 --> 01:06:39.412
The White House staff gonna be
jealous by given up that one.

01:06:39.454 --> 01:06:43.082
Come on, Connie. Let me
close out the thing in style.

01:06:43.124 --> 01:06:45.251
I've come to feel it's my thing.

01:06:45.293 --> 01:06:49.130
You take a job, you take a job, and
many times, it's just a job, you know.

01:06:49.172 --> 01:06:50.673
And then... You know what I mean?

01:06:50.715 --> 01:06:52.217
Hell of a ride, Stanley. Hell of a ride.

01:06:52.258 --> 01:06:53.676
Isn't it? Isn't it?

01:06:53.718 --> 01:06:55.386
You know, you take the
bitter with the sweet...

01:06:55.428 --> 01:06:57.055
...or the sweet with the bitter.

01:06:57.096 --> 01:07:00.934
What's that expression?

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:05.396
...feeling good about the economy.

01:07:05.438 --> 01:07:07.065
That's why we're voting
for the president, Ed.

01:07:07.106 --> 01:07:08.775
What do you think?

01:07:08.816 --> 01:07:12.737
Well, Bob, my mind wasn't
100% made up, but now it is.

01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:18.368
I say, don't go changing
horses in midstream.

01:07:18.493 --> 01:07:19.953
Absolutely.

01:07:19.994 --> 01:07:22.622
Who needs surprises these days?

01:07:22.664 --> 01:07:24.582
For an economy you can rely on...

01:07:24.624 --> 01:07:27.627
Fucking amateurs.

01:07:27.669 --> 01:07:31.547
Pity of it is, two more days,
and we bring it all back home.

01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:33.132
Knock wood.

01:07:33.174 --> 01:07:35.426
And who's gonna know?

01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:38.763
Who's gonna know what we did?

01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:40.348
Pride of a job well done, Stan.

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:45.228
It's the pride of a job well
done, but it's more that, Stanley.

01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:49.023
It's the gratitude of your
party and your president, right?

01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:53.820
- Is that the thing?
- Indeed it is. Indeed it is.

01:07:53.861 --> 01:07:57.282
Dean City, Oklahoma.
Army special programs.

01:07:57.323 --> 01:07:58.700

01:07:58.741 --> 01:08:01.244
We'll bring him back and
stash him in the hospital.

01:08:01.286 --> 01:08:04.330
Call the plane. Tell me
where to pick him up.

01:08:04.372 --> 01:08:07.542
I bet you're good at chess.

01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:10.753
I would be, I could remember
how all the pieces move.

01:08:10.795 --> 01:08:13.256
Ok. So, we'll call you. Ok.

...that he's expected in
Washington tomorrow morning.

01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:51.169

...Big Bird's gonna meet
Schumann at the airport?

01:09:00.886 --> 01:09:03.639
Big mistake. Big mistake. You
got to bring him in by stages.

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:06.975
Big mistake to reveal
Schumann before the election.

01:09:07.018 --> 01:09:08.185
How so?

01:09:08.227 --> 01:09:11.022
Sweetheart, Schumann is the shark. Ok?

01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:12.523
Schumann is Jaws.

01:09:12.564 --> 01:09:14.942
You know, you have to tease
'em. You gotta tease 'em.

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:18.237
You don't put Jaws in the
first reel of the movie.

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:20.365
It's the contract, sweetheart.

01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:23.158

Everybody's gotta learn.

01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:37.631
Any business.

01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:39.300
You take the fruit of 40 years...

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:41.636
...hard lessons, mistakes,
and you call it wisdom.

01:09:41.676 --> 01:09:42.970
That's the truth.

Yeah, but...

I don't even like to go to Brentwood.

You know, Connie? This
here, Schumann and us...

01:11:15.855 --> 01:11:18.441
Look at that. King
Kong and the trainers.

01:11:18.483 --> 01:11:21.360
This is it.

01:11:22.487 --> 01:11:25.323
I'm standing here for this picture
of Sergeant Willie Schumann.

01:11:25.364 --> 01:11:30.161
He's become known to Americans simply
as the Old Shoe. He is a war hero...

01:11:30.203 --> 01:11:31.787
This is gonna be a masterpiece.

01:11:31.829 --> 01:11:33.164
Giving them what they want.

01:11:33.206 --> 01:11:36.834
...from his Group 303 and left
behind in enemy territory.

01:11:36.876 --> 01:11:38.878
- Here at Andrews Air Force Base...
- Here it comes.

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:44.926
...they prepare for the
return of Willie Schumann.

01:11:48.387 --> 01:11:51.641
Sergeant Schumann, if I
may, welcome to history.

01:11:51.682 --> 01:11:53.518
Sergeant Schumann, I'm Ames. Welcome.

01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:55.186
Somebody named Brean?

01:11:55.228 --> 01:11:56.729
Yeah. Right here.

01:11:56.771 --> 01:12:00.024
Sign here for me, please, sir.

01:12:00.066 --> 01:12:03.027
Captain, you want to
take her up, please?

01:12:03.069 --> 01:12:04.570
There's heavy weather back east.

01:12:04.612 --> 01:12:05.530
What do you think?

01:12:05.571 --> 01:12:07.990
6 to 5 and pick 'em.
You want to chance it?

01:12:08.032 --> 01:12:13.871
If it'll fly, let's fly.
People are waiting for.

01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:18.334
A child at the airport
breaks through the ranks...

01:12:18.376 --> 01:12:22.046
...runs to Old Shoe, rubs
meat on Schumann's cuff.

01:12:22.088 --> 01:12:24.423
A little dog runs to it.
The dog loves Schumann.

01:12:24.465 --> 01:12:26.842
He is a perfect war hero.

01:12:26.884 --> 01:12:28.386
Perfect.

01:12:28.427 --> 01:12:30.137
You cast him.

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:33.933
All right. Book it up.

01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:36.561
What's this?

01:12:36.602 --> 01:12:40.273
Keys to the manacles.

01:12:41.816 --> 01:12:43.901
Oh, my God.

01:12:43.943 --> 01:12:49.282
Wait. Wait. What do you...
Wait. Just wait. Wait. Wait.

01:12:49.323 --> 01:12:53.160
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

01:12:53.494 --> 01:12:55.621
What is the trouble?

01:12:55.663 --> 01:12:58.040
No trouble at all, ma'am.

01:12:58.082 --> 01:13:00.960
Then why is he in chains?

01:13:01.002 --> 01:13:04.255
He's in chains because he's a convict.

01:13:04.297 --> 01:13:07.091
A convict?

01:13:10.094 --> 01:13:13.222
How you doing?

01:13:25.401 --> 01:13:28.362
Take a look.

01:13:30.489 --> 01:13:34.285
All right, well. When we
asked for special programs...

01:13:34.327 --> 01:13:36.162
...they gave us special prisons.

01:13:36.203 --> 01:13:38.247
Only a one-word difference.

01:13:38.289 --> 01:13:41.083
- Has he been in jail long?
- 12 years.

01:13:41.125 --> 01:13:44.545
Does he have much longer to serve?

01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:45.880
What did he do?

01:13:45.921 --> 01:13:49.634
- He raped a nun.
- Oh, God. Oh. God. Je... Oh, God.

01:13:49.675 --> 01:13:51.969
- And...
- I don't want to know an "and."

01:13:52.011 --> 01:13:53.220
Why is there an "and"?

01:13:53.262 --> 01:13:57.350
Look, look, look. He's fine as
long as he gets his medications.

01:13:57.391 --> 01:13:59.268
And if he doesn't get his medications?

01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:02.438
He's not fine.

01:14:03.689 --> 01:14:06.901
Yeah, Captain. Yeah, Captain.

01:14:06.943 --> 01:14:11.656
You'd better get us to Washington.

01:14:14.867 --> 01:14:17.453
How are ya?

01:14:17.495 --> 01:14:19.914
Fine.

01:14:29.048 --> 01:14:31.258
Gonna get me back tomorrow?

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:34.387
'Cause, you know, tomorrow
they're having beans.

01:14:34.428 --> 01:14:36.847
I need a real readjustment.
We have to rethink this.

01:14:36.889 --> 01:14:37.848
Beans!

01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:40.351
William. Yes. We're
trying to do this thing.

01:14:40.393 --> 01:14:43.938
- As long as you get me back for the beans.
- For the beans, yes.

01:14:43.979 --> 01:14:45.731
He's a lot sicker than we thought.

01:14:45.773 --> 01:14:49.402
Rush him under wraps to Walter
Reed for serious tests.

01:14:49.443 --> 01:14:52.863
If you're gonna keep me out, I can
like the chance to go to church.

01:14:52.905 --> 01:14:55.533
You know what I mean?

01:14:55.574 --> 01:14:59.412
Are you very religious?

01:15:02.248 --> 01:15:04.208
What have you done to me?

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:06.335
What have you done to me?

01:15:06.377 --> 01:15:09.130
All combat takes place
at night in the rain...

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:10.756
...at the junction of four map segments.

01:15:10.798 --> 01:15:12.091
What are you going to do?

01:15:12.133 --> 01:15:14.176
He's fine as long as he
gets his medication.

01:15:14.218 --> 01:15:18.139
Well, speaking of that, we're
gonna need lots of this stuffs.

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:20.057
Why don't you get on
the phone and get it?

01:15:20.099 --> 01:15:22.852
I think, you people are
looking at this all wrong.

01:15:22.893 --> 01:15:24.687
If you look at the back story...

01:15:24.729 --> 01:15:26.856
...the guy is coming back
from combat and torture...

01:15:26.897 --> 01:15:30.025
...of course he's going
to be a little fucked up.

01:15:30.067 --> 01:15:31.736
Of course he's gonna need a little help.

01:15:31.777 --> 01:15:35.114
Anybody want a beer?
'Cause I could party.

01:15:35.156 --> 01:15:37.032
I'm gonna need an ambulance.

01:15:37.074 --> 01:15:38.826
We take him the last
moment from the plane.

01:15:38.868 --> 01:15:42.747
No, no, no. We land, take him from the
plane. We put him in the ambulance.

01:15:42.788 --> 01:15:45.916
Air Force jet lands, we take
somebody else from that jet.

01:15:45.958 --> 01:15:48.169
What the fuck do I care?

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:49.754
Somebody in a hospital gown.

01:15:49.795 --> 01:15:51.422
You get me back for the beans.

01:15:51.464 --> 01:15:52.923
You know, 'cause tomorrow's the beans.

01:15:52.965 --> 01:15:54.550
'Cause this dog ain't gonna hunt.

01:15:54.592 --> 01:15:56.927
Oh, no. He's gonna be fine.

01:15:56.969 --> 01:15:58.345
Aren't you, William?

01:15:58.387 --> 01:16:01.265
Speaking of which, I have a prescription
and I wanna give you the number.

01:16:01.307 --> 01:16:03.225
I want you standing by
with a lot of this stuff.

01:16:03.267 --> 01:16:07.021
A crate of it. It's...

01:16:07.646 --> 01:16:09.523
Anti-psychotic.

01:16:09.565 --> 01:16:13.110
Anti-psychotic. The number
is V... Hello? Hello?

01:16:13.152 --> 01:16:14.570
This is nothing.

01:16:14.612 --> 01:16:16.530
The old days, I used to
think I was a pharmacist...

01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:18.032
...the stuff I had carrying around.

01:16:18.073 --> 01:16:22.912
With the beans, you can tell if
they're puttin' stuff in it.

01:16:22.953 --> 01:16:26.624
So you don't have to fear it.

01:16:26.665 --> 01:16:28.876
What kind of stuff?

01:16:28.918 --> 01:16:30.961
Yeah. Hello? Hello? Are you around?

01:16:31.003 --> 01:16:33.881
What do you mean, what kind of stuff?

01:16:33.923 --> 01:16:36.050
- No. What kind of stuff?
- What do you mean?

01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:38.636
He just wanted to know what
you meant. He didn't mean.

01:16:38.677 --> 01:16:40.137
Did you mean?

01:16:40.179 --> 01:16:42.223
- I didn't mean. No. Not at all.
- He didn't mean.

01:16:42.264 --> 01:16:44.809
- He didn't mean anything.
- You meant something. What do you mean?

01:16:44.850 --> 01:16:46.143
No, no, no. He didn't mean anything.

01:16:46.185 --> 01:16:47.561
Give him another pill.

01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:51.690
What the fuck do you
mean, what kind of stuff?

01:16:51.732 --> 01:16:54.026
Pill, William.

01:16:54.068 --> 01:16:57.154
This is nothing. Did
you ever shoot in Italy?

01:16:57.196 --> 01:17:00.449
Try three Italian starlets
swacked-out on Benzedrine and grappa.

01:17:00.491 --> 01:17:02.618
This is nothing.

01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:06.831
This is a walk in the park.

01:17:07.081 --> 01:17:08.457
Who are you?

01:17:08.499 --> 01:17:10.835
Who are you sons of bitches?

01:17:10.876 --> 01:17:13.295
- Killers!
- Just calm down.

01:17:13.337 --> 01:17:18.634
Where are you taking me?
Where are you taking me?

01:17:18.676 --> 01:17:21.554
Oh, my God!

01:17:24.139 --> 01:17:26.433
Sergeant Willie Schumann is coming home.

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:28.769
Schumann's plane should be
somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean...

01:17:28.811 --> 01:17:31.647
...making its final descent
back into this country.

01:17:31.689 --> 01:17:32.898
The White House reported...

01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:36.235
...he was safely rescued and on
his way back to American soil.

01:17:36.277 --> 01:17:38.571
We're still waiting for
his plane to land...

01:17:38.612 --> 01:17:40.364
...at Andrews Air Force Base.

01:17:40.406 --> 01:17:43.200
A plane that is due to
land. Long overdue.

01:17:43.242 --> 01:17:46.537
The president is monitoring
the situation personally...

01:17:46.579 --> 01:17:47.705
...and closely.

01:17:47.746 --> 01:17:50.124
We will keep you updated
as to any developments.

01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:51.917
Thank you very much.

01:17:51.959 --> 01:17:55.129
Oh, God. What do we do now?

01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:57.298
What do we do now, boy producer?

01:17:57.339 --> 01:18:00.175
Mister win-an-Emmy,
social-conscience, whale-shit...

01:18:00.217 --> 01:18:02.511
...save-the-rain-forest,
peacenik-commie...

01:18:02.553 --> 01:18:04.638
...fuckin'- hire-a-convict shithead?

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:08.225
What do we do now, liberal,
affirmative action, shithead...

01:18:08.267 --> 01:18:11.562
...peacenik commie fuck?
What do you wanna do now?

01:18:11.604 --> 01:18:14.565
This is nothing. Piece of cake.

01:18:14.607 --> 01:18:17.359
Producing is being a samurai warrior.

01:18:17.401 --> 01:18:19.028
They pay you day in,
day out for years...

01:18:19.069 --> 01:18:21.739
...so that one day, when called upon...

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:24.742
...you can respond, your
training at its peak...

01:18:24.783 --> 01:18:28.370
...and save the day!

01:18:30.122 --> 01:18:32.041
Produce this Schumann.

01:18:32.082 --> 01:18:33.626
Produce him, I say...

01:18:33.667 --> 01:18:35.169
...or, and I don't
hesitate to say this...

01:18:35.210 --> 01:18:39.632
...rank him as just another in
a series of broken promises.

01:18:39.673 --> 01:18:43.510
This tardy absence of the
flight must give us pause...

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:48.057
...and in that pause, we should
take time to examine ourselves...

01:18:48.098 --> 01:18:49.558
Fuck you.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.769
Leave it alone. What did
television do to you?

01:18:51.810 --> 01:18:54.438
It destroyed the electoral process.

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:57.524
Ok. Enough lovemaking.
Let's go. Come on.

01:18:57.566 --> 01:19:00.778
- Where?
- We got work to do, Winifred.

01:19:00.819 --> 01:19:02.321
Come on, pal.

01:19:02.363 --> 01:19:04.073
Is it time for exercise?

01:19:04.114 --> 01:19:06.367
'Cause, you know. It's
my day in the yard.

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:07.576
Let's get him out to the highway.

01:19:07.618 --> 01:19:09.954
You think this is tough? Come on, pal!

01:19:09.995 --> 01:19:12.331
This is nothing! Piece of cake!

01:19:12.373 --> 01:19:14.041
Albanian dissidents...

01:19:14.083 --> 01:19:17.252
...having somehow obtained
a surface-to-air missile...

01:19:17.294 --> 01:19:19.463
Connie, you had your fortune right here.

01:19:19.505 --> 01:19:21.465
You were ready to throw it away.

01:19:21.507 --> 01:19:24.760
Listen. If you got a problem,
solve it. That's producing.

01:19:24.802 --> 01:19:28.013
Someday when they tell this story...

01:19:28.055 --> 01:19:29.473
You can't tell this story.

01:19:29.515 --> 01:19:32.226
- Why not?
- Somebody would have you killed.

01:19:32.267 --> 01:19:34.520
Of course, I know.

01:19:34.561 --> 01:19:38.399
Not now. Not now. But I mean,
when they do tell the story...

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:42.987
Nobody can tell this
story Stanley, ever.

01:19:43.028 --> 01:19:47.032
Listen to me. This is
what I do for a living.

01:19:47.074 --> 01:19:49.326
You can't tell this story.
He's not kidding with you.

01:19:49.368 --> 01:19:51.453
You can't tell this
story. You knew that.

01:19:51.495 --> 01:19:54.832
The deal was you get an ambassadorship.

01:19:54.873 --> 01:19:57.001
I used to have a Camaro.

01:19:57.042 --> 01:19:59.670
What the fuck kind of story are you going
to tell anyway? The guy's a nut case.

01:19:59.712 --> 01:20:01.839
You would be too if you went
through what he went through.

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:03.340
He raped a nun.

01:20:03.382 --> 01:20:04.717
What he went through in Albania.

01:20:04.758 --> 01:20:06.010
He's doped to the gills.

01:20:06.051 --> 01:20:07.511
Where's my little pills?

01:20:07.553 --> 01:20:08.637
Show some compassion.

01:20:08.679 --> 01:20:11.098
He spent the last 12 years
in a military prison.

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:13.309
How are we gonna explain that?

01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:15.394
How we gonna explain it? Am I worried?

01:20:15.436 --> 01:20:17.521
How do we explain that when
the world is watching?

01:20:17.563 --> 01:20:20.024
Fuck the world. Try a 10 a.m.
pitch meeting...

01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:22.526
...coked to the gills, no sleeping,
haven't even read the treatment.

01:20:22.568 --> 01:20:25.070
Connie, how we gonna explain
in fact he was in prison?

01:20:25.112 --> 01:20:27.114
How you gonna explain that?
Well, you see, Winifred...

01:20:27.156 --> 01:20:28.907
...this is where you've
never been at a pitch.

01:20:28.949 --> 01:20:30.826
His records say he was in prison...

01:20:30.868 --> 01:20:34.038
...as all the record say for all
the men and women of Group 303...

01:20:34.079 --> 01:20:39.918
...as they must because
of the secrecy involved.

01:20:55.601 --> 01:20:57.061
I'm on top of it.

01:20:57.102 --> 01:20:59.063
Not sure whether enemy action...

01:20:59.104 --> 01:21:02.066
I'm fine. I'm fine. I got it.

01:21:02.107 --> 01:21:05.235
Stanley, I told you, I
do this for a living.

01:21:05.277 --> 01:21:06.403
You do what for a living?

01:21:06.445 --> 01:21:08.238
Exactly what do you
do for the president?

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:12.618
I lost my wallet. You got any change?

01:21:12.659 --> 01:21:14.244
How we doing, boy?

01:21:14.286 --> 01:21:15.746
Ready to mix it up?

01:21:15.788 --> 01:21:17.748
Is today laundry day?

01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:20.709
- What do you do on laundry day?
- Laundry.

01:21:20.751 --> 01:21:23.337
Stand by to copy this.
Just get a pencil.

01:21:23.378 --> 01:21:24.922
Down safely.

01:21:24.963 --> 01:21:27.049
Produce this Schumann.

01:21:27.091 --> 01:21:30.427
Produce him, I say, or, and I
don't hesitate to say this...

01:21:30.469 --> 01:21:34.640
...rank him as just another in
a series of broken promises.

01:21:34.681 --> 01:21:36.141
Sustained minor injuries.

01:21:36.183 --> 01:21:38.560
Flight crew being investigated
for possible pilot error.

01:21:38.602 --> 01:21:42.022
Transshipped to an undisclosed location.

01:21:42.064 --> 01:21:45.776
This deserted runway should
be filled with well-wishers...

01:21:45.818 --> 01:21:48.946
How you doing? A cold drink?

01:21:48.987 --> 01:21:51.281
Schumann was to return to
American soil today...

01:21:51.323 --> 01:21:54.159
...after his safe rescue in Albania.

01:21:54.201 --> 01:21:57.579
He looks like me.

01:21:57.663 --> 01:22:01.416
William Schumann deserves an
explanation from the White House.

01:22:01.458 --> 01:22:05.129
Wait, we are now going
live to the White House.

01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:08.132
I have an update regarding
the aircraft incident...

01:22:08.173 --> 01:22:09.299
...involving Sergeant Schumann.

01:22:09.341 --> 01:22:11.969
He is down safely and he
will be transshipped.

01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:14.721
We are informed he has
sustained minor injuries...

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:16.515
...which will require his
being medicated for some time...

01:22:16.557 --> 01:22:20.477
Bring in the cavalry. Nick of time.

01:22:20.519 --> 01:22:22.938
You see that? Political
shitbirds. Fuck with us, huh?

01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:28.277
They don't know who
they're playing with.

01:22:29.695 --> 01:22:32.156
Purty.

01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:34.867
I'm a little concerned
about the driver of the rig.

01:22:34.908 --> 01:22:36.243
- What rig?
- The harvester.

01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:44.918
- What about him?
- He doesn't have his green card. He doesn't have his green card.

01:22:45.043 --> 01:22:46.170
So what?

01:22:46.211 --> 01:22:49.673
So, you want Schumann to be
rescued by an illegal alien?

01:22:49.715 --> 01:22:52.634
We can't have Schumann saved
by an illegal immigrant.

01:22:52.676 --> 01:22:54.761
Get on the phone. Fly in a judge.

01:22:54.803 --> 01:23:00.559
Get on the phone. What's
all this moping about?

01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:06.857
Do you have any change?

01:23:06.899 --> 01:23:12.112
I like the night life, I like to boogie.

01:23:12.487 --> 01:23:13.655
Susie!

01:23:13.697 --> 01:23:15.199
William?

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:17.826
Susie, are you all right?

01:23:17.868 --> 01:23:20.829
Susie, are you all right?

01:23:20.871 --> 01:23:23.582
Kickball.

01:23:27.252 --> 01:23:28.795
Susan, are you all right?

01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:30.964
Let me talk to him!

01:23:31.006 --> 01:23:33.217
Why did you drop...

01:23:33.258 --> 01:23:34.259
I think we should...

01:23:34.301 --> 01:23:38.096
Willie, where are you going?

01:23:38.138 --> 01:23:40.849
Shoester!

01:23:45.604 --> 01:23:48.774
Let me talk to him. Shoe, you in there?

01:23:48.815 --> 01:23:50.609
I'll kill that son of a bitch.

01:23:50.651 --> 01:23:53.612
I have a relationship.
Shoe, you want to talk?

01:23:53.654 --> 01:23:56.114
Get you anything you
want. You want some beans?

01:23:56.156 --> 01:23:59.743
Will that do it, Shoester?

01:23:59.785 --> 01:24:02.913
Come on, Shoe!

01:24:03.664 --> 01:24:07.167
Oh, God! He's dead.

01:24:13.966 --> 01:24:15.300
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

01:24:15.342 --> 01:24:18.637
He's not dead. He's alive.

01:24:18.679 --> 01:24:21.640
Strike that.

01:24:24.017 --> 01:24:26.728
Oh, Jesus!

01:24:26.770 --> 01:24:28.939
So close and yet so far.

01:24:28.981 --> 01:24:30.107
What do you mean?

01:24:30.148 --> 01:24:31.650
We were this close.

01:24:31.692 --> 01:24:33.277
This is nothing. What
are you talking about?

01:24:33.318 --> 01:24:35.112
This is nothing. This just got big.

01:24:35.153 --> 01:24:37.239
Got big? Got big? He's dead. He's dead.

01:24:37.281 --> 01:24:39.950
We killed Old Shoe.

01:24:39.992 --> 01:24:47.040
And what is better than the
triumphal homecoming of a war hero?

01:24:51.003 --> 01:24:53.380
Ready!

Good. Good. Good. Looking good.

01:26:11.958 --> 01:26:14.127
Bring it all back home.

01:26:14.169 --> 01:26:16.880
Lassie barks twice, and it's
time to take out the garbage.

01:26:16.922 --> 01:26:18.423
Hell of a show, Stan.

01:26:18.465 --> 01:26:19.841
Hell of a job.

01:26:19.883 --> 01:26:22.511
It's just producing. That's what it is.

01:26:22.552 --> 01:26:24.638
You know, there's no
Academy Award for producing.

01:26:24.679 --> 01:26:27.224
- You're kidding.
- There's no Academy Award for producing.

01:26:27.265 --> 01:26:30.852
Where do movies come from if
nobody produces them, Connie?

01:26:30.894 --> 01:26:34.773
They come from people like you.

01:26:34.815 --> 01:26:38.527
Well, you know. You just got to
take the bitter with the better.

01:26:38.568 --> 01:26:40.570
Job's almost done.

01:26:40.612 --> 01:26:42.614
Knock on wood.

01:26:42.656 --> 01:26:44.032
We did a good job.

01:26:44.074 --> 01:26:46.827
That's our reward.

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:48.620
You know, you can't save the world.

01:26:48.662 --> 01:26:50.497
All you can do is try.

01:26:50.539 --> 01:26:54.209
Ain't that the truth?

01:26:57.963 --> 01:26:59.756
And, as we said, the president...

01:26:59.798 --> 01:27:02.634
...thrust of the Albanian
episode to put him over the top.

01:27:02.676 --> 01:27:05.595
Yes. You could say that, Shirley,
but it's just simply just not true.

01:27:05.637 --> 01:27:06.638
What would be true, then?

01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:09.349
Well, you said it yourself
earlier, if I may rephrase...

01:27:09.391 --> 01:27:11.560
...that the success of the
president in the polls...

01:27:11.601 --> 01:27:15.313
- As of today, 89% favorable.
- 89% favorable...

01:27:15.355 --> 01:27:18.316
...is based not on the events,
which of course we cannot control...

01:27:18.358 --> 01:27:21.069
...but on the spin
given to those events.

01:27:21.111 --> 01:27:24.614
What's the lesson here, Connie?
Never give up. Never give up.

01:27:24.656 --> 01:27:26.158
You're right. You're right.

01:27:26.199 --> 01:27:27.159
The show must go on.

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:28.452
Proud traditions.

01:27:28.493 --> 01:27:32.998
I am prouder of this than
anything I ever did in my life.

01:27:33.039 --> 01:27:34.207
You should be, Stan.

01:27:34.249 --> 01:27:36.460
I want to thank you, Connie.

01:27:36.501 --> 01:27:39.254
I want to thank you.

01:27:39.296 --> 01:27:44.551
- You gave me a good opportunity.
- Thank you. Thank you.

01:27:44.593 --> 01:27:47.721
And as we said, the president,
a surefire winner...

01:27:47.762 --> 01:27:51.224
...and the campaign, many
said, that put him there.

01:27:51.266 --> 01:27:53.977
Another great race today, Johnny.

01:27:54.019 --> 01:27:55.645
Who are you going to ride in the Stakes?

01:27:55.687 --> 01:27:58.482
Eddie, like my daddy
always used to say...

01:27:58.523 --> 01:27:59.691
The message is irrelevant.

01:27:59.733 --> 01:28:01.776
The main element here
we have to deal with...

01:28:01.818 --> 01:28:04.696
...is the fact that fear is what's
driving a lot of people. Ok?

01:28:04.738 --> 01:28:07.532
Yes. Commercials. Commercials.
Commercials. Commercials.

01:28:07.574 --> 01:28:09.075
The president is a product.

01:28:09.117 --> 01:28:10.660
Yes, the president is a product.

01:28:10.702 --> 01:28:13.955
He's the President of the
United States of America. 89%.

01:28:13.997 --> 01:28:15.332
Which we're dealing with today.

01:28:15.373 --> 01:28:18.168
Commercials. Commercials.
Commercials. Commercials.

01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:21.087
It's time the American people
began to take a look at that.

01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:24.132
And, now we're going to
be taken your calls.

01:28:24.174 --> 01:28:29.596
- The number is 1-800-555-0199.
- Oh, shit.

01:28:37.062 --> 01:28:38.897
Stanley, what are you doing?

01:28:38.939 --> 01:28:41.525
What am I doing?

01:28:41.566 --> 01:28:44.528
I wanna call somebody up.

01:28:44.569 --> 01:28:45.946
Stan, that's very funny.

01:28:45.987 --> 01:28:47.697
I'm going to get these people straight.

01:28:47.739 --> 01:28:49.241
You can't do that, Stanley.

01:28:49.282 --> 01:28:51.993
Watch me.

01:28:55.539 --> 01:28:56.915
Stan, you knew the deal
when you signed on.

01:28:56.957 --> 01:28:58.833
Come on. Deals change.

01:28:58.875 --> 01:29:00.961
Sure it is.

01:29:01.002 --> 01:29:03.630
Let's rethink that ambassadorship.

01:29:03.672 --> 01:29:05.966
I'm talking London. I'm talking Paris.

01:29:06.007 --> 01:29:08.176
I'm talking a secret account
for your extra expenses...

01:29:08.218 --> 01:29:09.761
...getting laid whenever you want.

01:29:09.803 --> 01:29:11.388
Marine guards will
salute you all the time.

01:29:11.429 --> 01:29:14.057
No. It's tempting, but I got
to answer to a higher calling.

01:29:14.099 --> 01:29:15.684
- Art.
- Money?

01:29:15.725 --> 01:29:18.061
Money? You think I did this for money?

01:29:18.103 --> 01:29:20.939
I did this for credit. For credit.

01:29:20.981 --> 01:29:22.357
You always knew you
couldn't take the credit.

01:29:22.399 --> 01:29:23.817
That's one thing. But I'm
not going to stand here...

01:29:23.858 --> 01:29:26.403
...and let two dickheads
from film school take it.

01:29:26.444 --> 01:29:28.113
Stanley, listen to me.

01:29:28.154 --> 01:29:29.281
Are you nuts?

01:29:29.322 --> 01:29:30.740
- Stanley, no fooling.
- What?

01:29:30.782 --> 01:29:32.409
You're playing with your life now.

01:29:32.450 --> 01:29:33.827
Fuck my life. Fuck my life.

01:29:33.868 --> 01:29:35.829
I want the credit. The credit.

01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:38.415
Do you know what the New York
Times said about my last picture?

01:29:38.456 --> 01:29:40.208
They called it "a thrill
ride for the ages..."

01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:41.793
...but they didn't mention the producer.

01:29:41.835 --> 01:29:43.920
They talked about the costumes...

01:29:43.962 --> 01:29:45.714
...but never talked about the producer.

01:29:45.755 --> 01:29:46.840
You know what that picture grossed?

01:29:46.881 --> 01:29:48.049
Now I'm going to stand here...

01:29:48.091 --> 01:29:50.260
...and let some limp-dick
film-school pansy...

01:29:50.302 --> 01:29:51.595
...take the credit? What?

01:29:51.636 --> 01:29:53.096
You can't do it.

01:29:53.138 --> 01:29:54.931
Don't you tell me that!

01:29:54.973 --> 01:29:57.434
Don't you ever tell me that!

01:29:57.475 --> 01:29:59.227
I am the producer of this show!

01:29:59.269 --> 01:30:01.313
If I didn't step up, you're nowhere!

01:30:01.354 --> 01:30:04.524
I put this together
out of spit and polish!

01:30:04.566 --> 01:30:05.942
Look at that.

01:30:05.984 --> 01:30:08.528
That is a complete fucking fraud...

01:30:08.570 --> 01:30:12.657
...and it looks 100% real.

01:30:17.871 --> 01:30:20.957
It's the best work I've
ever done in my life...

01:30:20.999 --> 01:30:25.086
...because it's so honest.

01:30:31.176 --> 01:30:33.136
They told me I couldn't
remake Moby Dick...

01:30:33.178 --> 01:30:34.804
...from the point of view of the whale.

01:30:34.846 --> 01:30:36.640
$450 million domestic.

01:30:36.681 --> 01:30:38.141
I'm not even talking about the video.

01:30:38.183 --> 01:30:40.268
I made this lame turkey fly.

01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:43.480
I did it... Pure Hollywood.

01:30:43.521 --> 01:30:47.150
For once in my life, I
will not be pissed on.

01:30:47.192 --> 01:30:49.444
Do you hear me?

01:30:49.486 --> 01:30:53.031
I want the credit. I want the credit.

01:30:53.073 --> 01:30:54.949
I'm taking it. Good bye.

01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:57.410
Shit.

01:31:11.049 --> 01:31:13.134
He's coming down.

01:31:13.176 --> 01:31:18.848
Connie, could I see you
here a minute? Thanks.

01:31:19.474 --> 01:31:20.684
Do you swear to uphold...

01:31:20.725 --> 01:31:22.268
...the duties and responsibilities...

01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:24.938
...of a citizen of the
United States of America...

01:31:24.979 --> 01:31:26.940
...to defend her in time of peril...

01:31:26.981 --> 01:31:30.443
...to defend her from all
enemies, foreign and domestic?

01:31:30.485 --> 01:31:35.865
Do you make this pledge
with full resolve?

♪ Common ground...

01:31:53.341 --> 01:31:56.553

And turning to the Hollywood page...

01:32:53.985 --> 01:32:56.946
...famed film producer
Stanley R. Motss...

01:32:56.988 --> 01:32:59.282
...died suddenly of a
massive heart attack...

01:32:59.324 --> 01:33:01.618
...while sunbathing poolside.

01:33:01.659 --> 01:33:05.246
Mr. Motss was 57 or 62-years-old...

01:33:05.288 --> 01:33:07.457
...depending on the bio.

01:33:07.499 --> 01:33:09.542
His credits include numerous films...

01:33:09.584 --> 01:33:15.590
...which America has come
to love as old classics.

01:33:18.384 --> 01:33:19.677
This just in.

01:33:19.719 --> 01:33:22.138
A group calling itself
"Albania Unite"...

01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:24.724
...has claimed responsibility
for the bombing moments ago...

01:33:24.766 --> 01:33:26.518
...of the village of Klos, Albania.
