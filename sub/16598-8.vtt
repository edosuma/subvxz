00:02.870 --> 00:04.205
Previously on The Exorcist...

00:04.238 --> 00:05.839
What do you want from me?
Quit pretending.

00:05.873 --> 00:08.576
You know perfectly well
what you must do.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.478
Bring her to me.

00:10.511 --> 00:11.512
(sizzling)

00:11.545 --> 00:13.381
How's Jim?
I moved out.

00:13.414 --> 00:15.216
There's a place
where I'm not married

00:15.249 --> 00:17.585
and you're not a priest.
Leave everything else outside.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.153
You're so special.

00:19.187 --> 00:20.921
Let me touch you.

00:20.954 --> 00:22.090
Let me touch you...
Come on.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.757
MARIA: Your Eminence,
and Father Bennet.

00:23.791 --> 00:25.593
So happy to have you.

00:25.626 --> 00:28.096
BENNETT:
Tattersal Landscaping.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.697
Perhaps you'd like
to explain to me

00:29.730 --> 00:31.199
how a defunct
landscaping company

00:31.232 --> 00:33.067
funnels nearly $3 million

00:33.101 --> 00:34.835
into a papal planning
committee.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.470
(grunting)

00:39.039 --> 00:40.040
(screams)

00:40.074 --> 00:42.042
The Devil in my Daughter.

00:42.076 --> 00:44.778
TALK SHOW HOST: What happened
to you in Georgetown?

00:44.812 --> 00:46.247
REGAN:
I remember that

00:46.280 --> 00:48.582
I couldn't control
my body sometimes.

00:48.616 --> 00:50.618
There was just
this voice.

00:50.651 --> 00:53.053
That's all I remember.

00:53.087 --> 00:55.022
What happened in that room...

00:55.055 --> 00:57.691
I can't... remember.

00:57.725 --> 00:58.926
(growling)

00:58.959 --> 01:01.095
So that your child
may be born again!

01:01.129 --> 01:03.097
(rumbling)

01:03.131 --> 01:05.299
Help me.
(gasps)

01:05.333 --> 01:07.235
(yelling):
Mother Bernadette!
(growling)

01:07.268 --> 01:09.103
MARCUS: Four decades ago, it had
Regan's body and it lost it.

01:09.137 --> 01:11.605
That is a demon
with a 40-year grudge.

01:11.639 --> 01:12.606
You're asking me to lie.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.975
God is in me. Yeah, lie.

01:15.976 --> 01:18.912
*

01:18.946 --> 01:20.948
(inhales)

01:22.250 --> 01:23.751
(door opens)

01:23.784 --> 01:24.785
(footsteps approach)

01:28.756 --> 01:30.691
(exhales)

01:33.927 --> 01:35.062
Get her out of here.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.797
It's her right to be here.

01:36.830 --> 01:39.567
(low, pleased growling)

01:39.600 --> 01:40.934
(exhales)

01:43.103 --> 01:45.406
(demonic voice):
The sow.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.707
Casey...

01:48.376 --> 01:50.778
Why didn't you tell me
you found her?

01:50.811 --> 01:52.313
That's my daughter.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.814
Only part of her.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.115
(grunts)

01:55.149 --> 01:57.050
ANGELA:
I'm her mother.

02:01.155 --> 02:02.523
Casey?

02:02.556 --> 02:04.758
(demonic voice):
Rags.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.927
Bloody rags.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.197
Casey, I know
you can hear me.

02:09.230 --> 02:12.866
I know you're in there.
Baby, you have to stay strong.
(door opens)

02:12.900 --> 02:15.936
NUN: I'm sorry, you
can't go in there.
HENRY: Get out of our way.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.572
KATHERINE: Let us in.
NUN: I'm sorry, you're gonna
have to hold back.

02:20.308 --> 02:22.176
Oh, my God.
Casey...

02:24.378 --> 02:26.347
You need to get this family
out of here right now.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.316
You need to get
out of my face right now.

02:28.349 --> 02:29.583
(demonic voice):
Mother MacNeil.

02:31.185 --> 02:32.920
Someone got old.

02:37.258 --> 02:38.859
(normal voice):
Kat?

02:41.929 --> 02:44.031
I knew you'd come.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.668
Are you here to take me home?

02:47.701 --> 02:50.371
Yeah. Just as soon
as you're better,

02:50.404 --> 02:51.705
we're gonna take you back.

02:51.739 --> 02:54.308
(demonic voice):
You're a terrible driver.

02:54.342 --> 02:55.709
What?

02:55.743 --> 02:57.177
Just walk away, Katherine.

02:57.211 --> 02:58.412
Almost ran me over

02:58.446 --> 03:01.349
when you ogled that
ginger whore's breasts.

03:01.382 --> 03:03.551
Only one in your
company with any talent,

03:03.584 --> 03:07.255
and you obliterated it
for a little lesbo curiosity.

03:07.288 --> 03:09.257
It's not her.
CASEY (normal voice):
Kat,

03:09.290 --> 03:11.692
look at me.
Get away, Kat.

03:11.725 --> 03:14.228
(demonic voice):
Is that you speaking,
Daddy Dimwit?

03:14.262 --> 03:16.196
Casey, honey...
Duh, duh,

03:16.230 --> 03:17.731
duh, Dad.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.567
Did you string those words, Dad,

03:19.600 --> 03:22.270
into a sentence
all by yourself, Dad?

03:22.303 --> 03:24.004
Head buried in blueprints

03:24.037 --> 03:25.706
while I unscrewed that screw,

03:25.739 --> 03:28.742
and sent the scaffolding
down, down,

03:28.776 --> 03:31.712
down, duh, duh,
duh, Dad?

03:31.745 --> 03:33.080
(growls)

03:33.113 --> 03:34.748
(grunts)

03:34.782 --> 03:36.584
(Katherine shrieks)

03:36.617 --> 03:38.619
(panting)

03:42.122 --> 03:45.593
MOTHER BERNADETTE:
"The glorious Mother of God,
the Virgin Mary,

03:45.626 --> 03:47.795
"commands you to flee.
We have come to crush

03:47.828 --> 03:50.964
your proud head..."
(normal voice):
What's wrong, Mommy?

03:50.998 --> 03:54.768
Get the hell out of my child.

03:54.802 --> 03:56.537
(demonic voice):
Hell?

03:56.570 --> 03:59.072
Do you know what Hell is, Regan?

03:59.106 --> 04:01.275
It's where Casey
is right now.

04:01.309 --> 04:02.576
(door closes)

04:02.610 --> 04:04.912
In a room
with no windows,

04:04.945 --> 04:06.714
nailed to the floor,

04:06.747 --> 04:09.216
surrounded by nothing.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.151
Alone forever.

04:11.184 --> 04:13.621
Knowing it was her mother
who put here there.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.490
But don't worry.

04:16.524 --> 04:20.127
There's room for you, too.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.162
*

04:53.561 --> 04:54.795
MARCUS AND TOMAS (distant):
God surrounds us.

04:54.828 --> 04:55.829
The love of God enfolds us.

04:55.863 --> 04:56.997
The power of God protects us.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.131
HENRY:
We should be in there.

04:58.165 --> 04:59.266
They're trying to save her.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.768
We should be allowed to...
(thump)

05:00.801 --> 05:03.170
What's the word?
What's the damn word?

05:03.203 --> 05:04.304
Watch.
Monitor!
We should be

05:04.338 --> 05:06.707
allowed to monitor
what is going on.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.141
How can you be
so calm about this?

05:08.175 --> 05:09.610
How can you just sit there
and be calm?

05:09.643 --> 05:11.044
I'm a lot of things right now,

05:11.078 --> 05:12.312
but calm is not one of them.

05:12.346 --> 05:14.715
This was the hardest part.

05:14.748 --> 05:17.785
And Father Maren
barred me from the room.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.219
You're left on the outside

05:19.252 --> 05:20.888
and you have to listen
to all those sounds.
Yeah?

05:20.921 --> 05:23.023
How'd that work out
for Father Maren?

05:23.056 --> 05:25.025
Honey.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.994
What?

05:27.027 --> 05:29.530
I need you to go home
and start packing for us.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.298
Oh, like hell. Like hell I am.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.401
We're not leaving her here.
ANGELA:
We're not.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.002
I'm gonna be here.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.537
I'm gonna get her back.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.138
And when this is over, when...

05:38.171 --> 05:39.707
when this works,

05:39.740 --> 05:42.009
it's gonna be bad for Casey.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.377
Just like it
was for me.
(loud thump)

05:43.411 --> 05:45.045
The police,
the... the media,

05:45.078 --> 05:46.714
everything.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.849
You don't want to put her
through that, do you?

05:48.882 --> 05:50.918
No.
(exhales)
So,

05:50.951 --> 05:52.319
we need you to be able to...

05:52.352 --> 05:54.422
pick up and get
the hell out of town.

05:54.455 --> 05:56.724
All right?
Can you do that for me?

05:56.757 --> 05:58.025
Just...

05:59.893 --> 06:02.195
...don't... don't
let them hurt her.

06:02.229 --> 06:04.031
Never.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.900
Call us, if anything changes.

06:06.934 --> 06:09.837
(prayer continues
indistinctly)

06:09.870 --> 06:11.872
(choral music playing)

06:16.143 --> 06:18.111
FEMALE REPORTER:
Mr. Rance!
(cameras clicking)

06:18.145 --> 06:19.580
(excited chatter)

06:25.719 --> 06:27.855
CHRIS:
Get out of her face!

06:27.888 --> 06:30.123
Get them to back off.
CHRIS:
Leave her alone.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.629
Mr. Rance, where is your
daughter? Mr. Rance, please.

06:35.663 --> 06:37.665
(car door opens, engine starts)

06:39.467 --> 06:41.869
(tires screech)

06:41.902 --> 06:43.904
FEMALE REPORTER:
Is Casey inside the building?

06:44.938 --> 06:46.940
(excited chatter)

06:48.509 --> 06:50.077
REPORTERS:
Where is Casey?

06:51.479 --> 06:54.281
You are trespassing
on private property.

06:54.314 --> 06:55.783
You are creating

06:55.816 --> 06:57.951
a hostile environment
for the sisters

06:57.985 --> 06:59.386
who are cloistered here.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.388
As head of this priory,

07:01.421 --> 07:03.123
I request that all of you leave.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.459
Otherwise, I will be forced

07:05.493 --> 07:07.227
to call the police, and...

07:07.260 --> 07:08.662
We're already here.

07:08.696 --> 07:10.598
I would like
these people to leave.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.466
Uh, public sidewalks,
so unless someone

07:12.500 --> 07:15.302
commits a specific crime, there
isn't a whole lot we can do.

07:15.335 --> 07:17.337
It's an unlawful gathering.
Look,

07:17.370 --> 07:20.140
why don't you let me come in,
take a quick look around,

07:20.173 --> 07:21.675
we can tell all
these nice people

07:21.709 --> 07:22.976
there's nothing to see here,

07:23.010 --> 07:24.612
everyone goes home.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.246
Do you have a warrant?

07:26.279 --> 07:28.181
I was hoping we
didn't need one, Sister.

07:28.215 --> 07:29.983
It's Mother.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.852
Five minutes,
we'll be out of your hair.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.286
(bell tolls)

07:33.320 --> 07:36.323
Ah. Would you look at that?

07:36.356 --> 07:40.027
You don't want to do that...

07:40.060 --> 07:42.262
(door opens)

07:42.295 --> 07:44.297
(sirens wailing in distance)

07:45.566 --> 07:46.734
(beeping)

07:48.001 --> 07:49.637
(inhales sharply):
Ugh.

07:49.670 --> 07:52.640
LESTER: Oh, quit squirming.
It's barely been punctured.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.474
(grunts)
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:54.508 --> 07:56.209
Have you ever been
stabbed before?

07:56.243 --> 07:58.111
Myrtle Beach, 1974.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.881
Ate two tabs of brown clown
in the parking lot

08:00.914 --> 08:03.851
after a supremely
disappointing ELO

08:03.884 --> 08:05.519
quote unquote "concert."
Yes.

08:05.553 --> 08:08.055
Yes, I'd like to report the
discovery of human remains.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.958
Um... probably like...
(large vehicle rumbling past)

08:10.991 --> 08:12.225
a dozen?

08:12.259 --> 08:13.961
Yeah, a dozen.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.196
Well, they wouldn't be remains

08:16.229 --> 08:18.165
if they weren't dead,
would they?

08:18.198 --> 08:20.467
Tattersal Landscaping
at Overton and 11th.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.702
Boiler room.

08:21.735 --> 08:23.170
Check the boiler room.

08:23.203 --> 08:26.907
Tattersal.
T-A-T-T-E-R-S-A-L.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.175
Sure. I'll hold.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.409
(beeps)

08:29.442 --> 08:31.144
Let me call.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.313
I do a bang-up '40s gumshoe.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.715
(cracks)

08:36.083 --> 08:39.319
MARCUS (distant):
Strike terror, Lord,

08:39.352 --> 08:41.521
into the beast now laying waste
to your vineyard.

08:41.555 --> 08:44.324
Fill your servants
with courage to fight manfully

08:44.357 --> 08:45.993
against that reprobate dragon...
Marcus...

08:46.026 --> 08:47.928
...lest he despise those who put
their trust in you...

08:47.961 --> 08:49.763
It's not working.
It wants Angela.

08:49.797 --> 08:51.565
All the more reason
to keep her away.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.767
You saw how it woke
when she was in here.

08:53.801 --> 08:56.670
She could help us draw
the demon out. Bait the whale.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.238
MARCUS: You never give
a demon what it wants.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.340
(squishing, squeaking)
Why not? Why not give it to her?

09:00.373 --> 09:03.176
You disobeyed my direct order.

09:03.210 --> 09:06.046
I don't take orders from you.
Well you should,
'cause you're gonna

09:06.079 --> 09:08.782
get her killed.
Well, I'm not the one
with blood on my hands.

09:08.816 --> 09:11.819
No, you're not,
'cause you're not an exorcist.
And you're not a priest.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.354
(insects buzzing)

09:14.387 --> 09:15.522
(grunts)

09:15.555 --> 09:16.890
(demonic voice laughs)

09:16.924 --> 09:18.992
Ugh!

09:23.997 --> 09:26.099
(insects chirping intensely)

09:26.133 --> 09:28.001
(whimpers)

09:29.637 --> 09:32.572
(growling, exhaling)

09:35.242 --> 09:36.543
Tomas, Tomas!
(grunts)

09:36.576 --> 09:37.778
Shh, shh!

09:37.811 --> 09:39.813
(panting)

09:40.814 --> 09:42.482
It worms its way in...

09:43.516 --> 09:46.153
...and it lays its little eggs.

09:46.186 --> 09:48.188
(laughing)

09:55.829 --> 09:57.831
(laughs)

09:58.832 --> 10:00.467
Angela beat it once.

10:02.302 --> 10:05.172
It's a risk.

10:10.310 --> 10:13.446
...blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.
(door opens)

10:13.480 --> 10:15.849
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
(footsteps)

10:15.883 --> 10:17.317
pray for us sinners,

10:17.350 --> 10:19.519
now and at the hour
of our death.

10:19.552 --> 10:23.490
Our Father, who art in heaven,

10:23.523 --> 10:25.425
hallowed be Thy name,
Thy kingdom come,

10:25.458 --> 10:26.660
Thy will be done...

10:26.694 --> 10:29.362
I'm ready.

10:39.873 --> 10:43.043
I can't emphasize enough
the risk you're taking.

10:43.076 --> 10:45.378
Don't think a 40-year absence
will protect you.

10:45.412 --> 10:48.448
I know this thing
better than anyone.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.950
If you feel it
poking around at all,

10:49.983 --> 10:51.451
even the slightest twinge,

10:51.484 --> 10:52.452
you run.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.221
Drop everything and run.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.222
(door opens)

10:55.255 --> 10:58.358
(hinges creaking)

10:58.391 --> 10:59.727
MOTHER BERNADETTE:
...all wretched powers...

10:59.760 --> 11:02.029
all wicked legions...

11:02.062 --> 11:05.365
(continues praying quietly)

11:07.600 --> 11:09.169
(exhales)

11:09.202 --> 11:10.971
(chains rattling)

11:11.004 --> 11:12.572
All infernal invaders...

11:12.605 --> 11:13.974
(demonic voice):
Hello, Mommy.

11:14.007 --> 11:14.975
(sizzling)

11:15.008 --> 11:16.977
You're not my daughter.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.712
(sizzling)

11:18.746 --> 11:20.413
That's right.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.750
Your daughter's dead.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.752
Isn't that what you told Padre?

11:26.854 --> 11:29.322
What kind of mother
gives up hope that easily?

11:29.356 --> 11:32.259
TOMAS AND MOTHER BERNADETTE:
All Satanic powers...

11:32.292 --> 11:33.894
(moaning)

11:33.927 --> 11:35.028
All wicked
legions...

11:35.062 --> 11:37.364
I liked you better as a soloist.

11:37.397 --> 11:38.832
Hiding behind a civilian,
Marcus?

11:38.866 --> 11:41.001
MARCUS:
Keep it talking.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.335
About what?

11:42.369 --> 11:43.904
The more mundane,
the better.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.572
Words don't matter.

11:45.605 --> 11:47.540
Yes, Mother.

11:47.574 --> 11:49.843
Distract me.

11:49.877 --> 11:52.612
Do-- do you remember
when you broke your foot?

11:52.645 --> 11:54.681
Riveting.

11:54.714 --> 11:55.448
Ah.

11:55.482 --> 11:58.118
(groaning)

11:58.151 --> 11:59.787
Keep on with it.

11:59.820 --> 12:00.921
You had a play date.

12:00.954 --> 12:02.189
You were at, uh,

12:02.222 --> 12:04.724
you were at
Saylor's house.

12:04.758 --> 12:06.894
And you were
climbing a tree

12:06.927 --> 12:08.361
in the backyard, the oak.

12:08.395 --> 12:11.098
And one of the
branches snapped,

12:11.131 --> 12:12.465
and you fell.

12:12.499 --> 12:14.601
Good. Keep talking.

12:14.634 --> 12:15.803
You fell.

12:15.836 --> 12:16.870
Uh, your foot...

12:16.904 --> 12:19.873
Casey, you broke
your foot.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.608
You thought about it,
didn't you?

12:21.641 --> 12:23.276
When she was born.

12:23.310 --> 12:26.046
Couldn't wait to rip her
from your teat

12:26.079 --> 12:27.747
like a sickly kitten.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.616
ANGELA:
And you didn't cry.

12:29.649 --> 12:30.984
You didn't even call home.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.619
Which is what you
really should have done.

12:32.652 --> 12:34.888
You just--
you just started walking.

12:34.922 --> 12:37.090
Suppose it's my fault...

12:37.124 --> 12:38.758
for stretching you out.

12:38.792 --> 12:41.461
Leaving a hole
that nothing

12:41.494 --> 12:42.996
could ever quite fill.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.998
You walked home.

12:45.032 --> 12:46.266
All three blocks.

12:46.299 --> 12:48.001
And you didn't cry.

12:48.035 --> 12:49.269
Not even once.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.171
On a broken foot, you walked.

12:51.204 --> 12:52.806
Not Henry.

12:52.840 --> 12:55.242
Not your daughters.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.677
Bet she didn't tell you...

12:57.710 --> 13:00.647
she scraped the first one out.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.749
And that's when--

13:02.782 --> 13:04.284
that's, that's when...

13:04.317 --> 13:06.086
Worried it would
come out like her.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.087
...I knew.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.255
Rotten.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.256
Filthy.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.358
I knew!
Putrid.

13:11.391 --> 13:14.461
I knew that no matter
what life threw you, Casey,

13:14.494 --> 13:15.929
that you
would be okay.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.130
Devil of lies.

13:17.164 --> 13:18.598
ANGELA: Because
you are strong.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.467
You are stronger

13:20.500 --> 13:21.969
...monster.
...than I could
ever be.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.336
Give way to Christ.
Casey!

13:23.370 --> 13:24.804
TOMAS:
Give way, you monster.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.106
I forgive you, fallen angel.
(sizzling)

13:26.139 --> 13:26.940
(groaning)

13:26.974 --> 13:28.008
None of your works.

13:28.041 --> 13:30.878
MARCUS:
I forgive you, fallen angel.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.279
I forgive you,
fallen angel.

13:32.312 --> 13:35.182
I forgive you,
fallen angel.

13:35.215 --> 13:37.784
I forgive you, fallen angel.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.187
MOTHER BERNADETTE:
Child of God, you are forgiven.
(growling)

13:40.220 --> 13:41.454
Walk into
the light.
(growling)

13:41.488 --> 13:43.056
(groaning)

13:43.090 --> 13:45.025
(growling)
MARCUS:
...you have no authority,

13:45.058 --> 13:46.526
but that which is given.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.461
Following up
on the gruesome discovery

13:48.495 --> 13:50.864
of an as-yet undisclosed
number of corpses

13:50.898 --> 13:54.067
at a decommissioned warehouse
in the Bronzeville neighborhood.

13:54.101 --> 13:55.702
At a press conference...

14:11.952 --> 14:13.720
NEWS ANCHOR: ...not to jump
to any conclusions.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.293
...they are narrowing down
a group of suspects

14:53.326 --> 14:55.762
and hope to have the perpetrator
or perpetrators

14:55.795 --> 14:57.830
in custody
in the very near future.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.734
Just whatever you need
for the next few weeks, okay?

15:01.768 --> 15:03.803
What's the rush? It's not like
we're gonna be able to move

15:03.836 --> 15:05.705
with the state
that Casey's in.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.274
I mean, you saw
how sick she looks.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.876
She's gonna need doctors,
medication.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.444
Do we even know
where the hell
we're moving to?

15:11.478 --> 15:13.246
Guelph.
Guelph?

15:13.280 --> 15:14.414
Yeah, it's outside Toronto.

15:14.447 --> 15:15.615
Canada.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.050
Who the hell
lives in Canada?

15:17.084 --> 15:18.618
I got in touch
with an old friend.

15:18.651 --> 15:19.953
So we run away
and what,

15:19.987 --> 15:21.288
just hope everyone
magically forgets

15:21.321 --> 15:22.555
that Casey
killed two people?

15:22.589 --> 15:23.556
That was the demon.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.192
That was not your sister!

15:26.259 --> 15:27.694
I know.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.631
Um,

15:31.664 --> 15:33.733
I've got a house
in Palm Springs.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.236
It's a little,
four-bedroom place.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.305
I bought it as a winter home.

15:38.338 --> 15:39.772
I haven't lived there in years.

15:39.806 --> 15:41.908
There's a renter.
I can boot him out.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.311
It's quiet
and it's private.

15:44.344 --> 15:45.612
No, they'll find us.

15:45.645 --> 15:46.846
Even if we
get her back,

15:46.879 --> 15:48.248
they're gonna
arrest her.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.483
They can find her
in Canada, too.

15:50.517 --> 15:51.985
Do you have a summer home
in Venezuela?

15:52.019 --> 15:53.253
I hear that's
where criminals go.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.454
She's not a criminal.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.256
I know, but you just said
she's gonna get arrested.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.490
Not a lot of dance schools

15:57.524 --> 15:59.326
in Guelph,
I'm guessing.

16:01.028 --> 16:02.362
Henry, you've
got to think of

16:02.395 --> 16:04.031
both daughters at this point.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.366
We're not splitting up
this family.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.235
I'm not going
back to school.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.870
Yes, you are.

16:10.903 --> 16:12.205
Honey, now,
it's lousy timing

16:12.239 --> 16:13.673
but I'm putting it out there.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.642
Don't.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.344
I've made up my mind.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.679
(zipper closing)

16:19.712 --> 16:21.648
(demonic growling)

16:21.681 --> 16:23.050
(chains rattling)

16:23.083 --> 16:25.785
...one baptism, one God
and Father of all

16:25.818 --> 16:28.488
who is above all and through
all and in all.
(growling)

16:28.521 --> 16:29.522
There is one body

16:29.556 --> 16:31.791
and one Spirit...
(growling loudly)

16:31.824 --> 16:33.826
that belongs to your call.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.295
(overlapping voices):
One Lord, one faith,

16:35.328 --> 16:38.231
one baptism, one God
and Father of all...

16:38.265 --> 16:40.067
who is over all
and through all...
(groaning)

16:40.100 --> 16:42.969
"Who was over all,
and through all and in all."

16:43.002 --> 16:45.038
Just as you were called...
(groaning)

16:45.072 --> 16:47.407
(wheezing)

16:47.440 --> 16:49.842
...one baptism,
one God and

16:49.876 --> 16:51.844
(growling)
...Father of all,
who is over all...

16:51.878 --> 16:52.779
and through all

16:52.812 --> 16:55.182
and in all.
There is one God and one...

16:55.215 --> 16:57.384
(growling)

16:57.417 --> 16:59.152
(demonic yelling)

16:59.186 --> 17:01.321
(groaning)
...one faith, one baptism,

17:01.354 --> 17:02.922
one God and
Father of all...

17:02.955 --> 17:04.491
ANGELA:
One faith, one baptism,

17:04.524 --> 17:06.193
one God and Father of all,

17:06.226 --> 17:09.529
who is over all and through all
and in all.

17:09.562 --> 17:10.997
But grace was given to each...

17:11.030 --> 17:13.433
...one of us,

17:13.466 --> 17:16.236
according to the measure
of Christ's gift.

17:16.269 --> 17:21.208
(demonic voice):
The things I could tell you
about Christ's gift.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.676
What are you doing?

17:23.710 --> 17:26.012
Let's play a game, Mother.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.615
Just you and me.

17:28.648 --> 17:32.085
(rumbling)

17:39.626 --> 17:41.628
RADIO ANNOUNCER:
Really cold day here in D.C.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.696
It's only gonna get up to
the mid-30s,

17:43.730 --> 17:46.266
so be sure to wear your muffs
and scarves out there.
(humming)

17:46.299 --> 17:48.635
What's going on? Beltway traffic
looking pretty good.
(humming continues)

17:48.668 --> 17:50.303
That fender-bender on the 395,

17:50.337 --> 17:51.571
we mentioned earlier

17:51.604 --> 17:53.206
looks to be all clear.
(humming)

17:53.240 --> 17:55.408
So for you Led Heads,
tickets for Zeppelin's

17:55.442 --> 17:57.076
North American Tour go on sale
(humming)

17:57.110 --> 17:58.611
next week...

17:58.645 --> 18:00.647
Is there anyone there?

18:00.680 --> 18:02.782
RADIO ANNOUNCER:
...so unless you want to drive

18:02.815 --> 18:04.651
to one of New York's
three Garden shows...

18:04.684 --> 18:06.786
No.
...grab some seats at the
Baltimore Civic Center.

18:11.924 --> 18:12.892
Is there anyone there?

18:12.925 --> 18:16.229
* ...run right

18:16.263 --> 18:18.665
Hello?
* Off you go to school

18:18.698 --> 18:20.400
* Where you can learn the rules
there right *

18:20.433 --> 18:21.868
Are you there?

18:25.472 --> 18:27.207
Hello?

18:31.778 --> 18:33.946
* Never go astray

18:33.980 --> 18:36.115
* And stay an honest
loving son *

18:36.149 --> 18:38.518
(chuckles)

18:38.551 --> 18:39.919
What's your name?

18:39.952 --> 18:43.022
* Son of my father

18:43.055 --> 18:46.926
* Molded, I was folded,
I was preform-packed *

18:46.959 --> 18:49.162
* Son of my father

18:49.196 --> 18:51.598
(planchette moving)

18:51.631 --> 18:54.133
* Commanded, I was branded
in a plastic vac' *

18:54.167 --> 18:57.204
* Surrounded and confounded
by statistic facts *

18:57.237 --> 19:01.308
(planchette moving)

19:05.845 --> 19:07.814
Captain Howdy.

19:07.847 --> 19:10.383
(scoffs)
Captain Howdy?

19:11.418 --> 19:13.220
What kind of
name is that?

19:17.690 --> 19:19.826
Captain Howdy?

19:19.859 --> 19:22.161
Is my mom ever gonna
get married again?

19:27.267 --> 19:29.869
SALESMAN:
Mm, no.

19:29.902 --> 19:32.605
REGAN:
Captain Howdy,
that's not very nice.

19:34.106 --> 19:35.342
You.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.576
How am I gonna
have a new dad

19:36.609 --> 19:38.345
if my mom never
finds someone?

19:38.378 --> 19:41.180
Still haven't found Daddy,
have we?

19:43.250 --> 19:44.651
Nice to see you all

19:44.684 --> 19:45.718
grown up, though.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.086
It's been a minute.

19:47.119 --> 19:50.423
You were the photographer,
at the zoo.

19:50.457 --> 19:52.325
And you were six.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.827
You took my picture.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.996
That was the first
time I saw...

19:57.029 --> 19:58.731
Watch the birdie.
(camera flashes)

19:58.765 --> 20:01.701
(bird fluttering)

20:03.903 --> 20:06.072
Why are you making
me watch this?

20:06.105 --> 20:08.708
I thought you didn't
remember most of it.

20:08.741 --> 20:11.043
Consider this a refresher,

20:11.077 --> 20:12.945
a stroll down memory lane.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.581
(door opens)

20:14.614 --> 20:15.882
CHRIS:
Rags?

20:17.650 --> 20:18.918
You down there?

20:20.953 --> 20:23.356
(Regan's voice):
Yeah, Mom. I'm fine.

20:23.390 --> 20:24.557
Geez.

20:24.591 --> 20:26.192
CHRIS:
Okay, Stinkpot.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.127
Just-- just
checking.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.562
(door closes)

20:29.596 --> 20:30.563
You own mother

20:30.597 --> 20:31.964
called you Stinkpot.

20:32.999 --> 20:36.102
I gave you memories.

20:36.135 --> 20:39.372
Do you know what's
my favorite memory of you?

20:39.406 --> 20:40.607
Mm...

20:40.640 --> 20:42.709
This...

20:42.742 --> 20:44.911
right here.

20:44.944 --> 20:47.980
My sweet, my dear...

20:49.015 --> 20:53.152
My Regan MacNeil.

20:53.185 --> 20:55.622
The girl that
got away.

20:59.158 --> 21:01.828
Look what you've done
to her, to me!

21:01.861 --> 21:05.332
Do you remember how much
pleasure you were feeling

21:05.365 --> 21:06.733
at this moment?

21:06.766 --> 21:09.436
The gates I unlocked
for you.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.338
Past.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.340
I ruined men
for you. Say it.

21:13.373 --> 21:14.741
That isn't true.

21:14.774 --> 21:18.811
Oh, yes. Henry?
Virility personified.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.613
Why did you choose me?

21:20.647 --> 21:23.516
"Why me"?

21:23.550 --> 21:26.786
"Why me"?

21:26.819 --> 21:28.688
Who are you?

21:28.721 --> 21:31.758
You expect me to say you have
some gift, some ability,

21:31.791 --> 21:35.127
something that sets you apart
and makes you special?

21:35.161 --> 21:36.929
You were chosen?

21:36.963 --> 21:39.866
There are close to eight
billion human beings

21:39.899 --> 21:44.371
crawling this earth--
you're like vermin. "Why me?"

21:44.404 --> 21:47.707
Because you were under
my foot, you stupid bitch.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.442
(chuckles)

21:49.476 --> 21:51.711
"Why me?"

21:51.744 --> 21:54.146
I will say this.

21:54.180 --> 21:57.283
It has good vintage, your whine.

21:57.316 --> 22:00.987
Even your Christ on his cross
screamed out,

22:01.020 --> 22:04.290
"Why me?"
like it was poetry.

22:04.323 --> 22:08.628
"Father, why hast Thou
forsaken me?"

22:08.661 --> 22:11.330
He was screaming in pain

22:11.364 --> 22:15.334
and shouting, "Damn you!

22:15.368 --> 22:17.470
Why me?"

22:17.504 --> 22:20.072
Leave my family alone!

22:21.874 --> 22:23.743
No.

22:25.712 --> 22:28.047
Forgot that, did you?

22:28.080 --> 22:29.649
Why are you doing this?

22:29.682 --> 22:32.519
Because you don't get
to walk away.

22:32.552 --> 22:35.187
Not after what you did.

22:35.221 --> 22:39.726
Besides...I miss your taste.

22:39.759 --> 22:41.494
Ah! Oh...

22:41.528 --> 22:44.363
Ahh.
Oh!

22:44.397 --> 22:46.232
You're different now.

22:46.265 --> 22:49.335
You taste like... death.

22:49.368 --> 22:50.870
(door opens)

22:50.903 --> 22:52.939
CHRIS:
Rags? Rags?

22:52.972 --> 22:54.641
Yoo-hoo.

22:56.776 --> 22:58.911
You sure you're okay?

22:58.945 --> 23:00.780
What you doing
down here?

23:00.813 --> 23:02.214
Oh, jeez.

23:02.248 --> 23:04.784
Where'd you get
that thing?

23:04.817 --> 23:06.886
Listen, go up
and say hi to Burke.

23:06.919 --> 23:10.623
He'd love to
see you. Yeah?

23:10.657 --> 23:12.024
What's the matter?

23:12.058 --> 23:15.027
(gasps):
Oh, I didn't tell you.

23:15.061 --> 23:16.429
(chuckles)

23:16.463 --> 23:20.032
Guess what?
Your momma is gonna be

23:20.066 --> 23:22.368
a great big movie
director.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.604
(chuckles)

23:24.637 --> 23:27.474
Well, maybe not big, but they
sent over this script,

23:27.507 --> 23:29.476
and they want me to direct
one-third of it.

23:29.509 --> 23:33.379
It's like this
triptych thing.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.281
What do you think?
Should I do it?

23:35.314 --> 23:38.050
It's called "Hope."
Come on up.

23:38.084 --> 23:41.120
Come upstairs, and I'll let you
have half a glass of wine.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.993
(demonic growls)

23:47.026 --> 23:48.828
MARCUS: You have no will
but that which is given.

23:48.861 --> 23:51.297
You have no authority
but that which is given.

23:51.330 --> 23:53.633
(praying indistinctly)

23:53.666 --> 23:58.905
(gasping)

23:58.938 --> 24:01.007
Return to the shadow,
viper!

24:01.040 --> 24:03.109
You have no hold
on this woman.

24:03.142 --> 24:05.077
Child of God,
you are forgiven.

24:05.111 --> 24:07.680
You are loved.
You are perfect and whole.

24:07.714 --> 24:10.016
There is no place for you here.

24:10.049 --> 24:11.150
Marcus!

24:11.183 --> 24:14.487
(gasping, banging continue)

24:14.521 --> 24:15.522
Yeah, worth a shot.

24:18.725 --> 24:23.162
Oh, my God, I'm heartily sorry
for having offended Thee.

24:23.195 --> 24:25.131
And I detest all my sins.

24:25.164 --> 24:26.432
(demonic voice):
Last rites, priest?

24:26.465 --> 24:28.467
Giving up on the piglet
so soon?

24:28.501 --> 24:30.870
The last rites aren't
for Casey, they're for you.

24:30.903 --> 24:33.305
Because I dread the loss of
Heaven and the pains of Hell.

24:33.339 --> 24:36.709
ALL: But most of all because
they offend Thee, my God,

24:36.743 --> 24:40.212
who are all good and deserving
of all my love.

24:40.246 --> 24:41.948
Sorry, Mommy, show's over.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.651
Time to give the people
what they want.

24:44.684 --> 24:45.818
Casey...

24:45.852 --> 24:48.187
(cracking)

24:48.220 --> 24:49.989
Casey! No!

24:50.022 --> 24:52.859
MARCUS:
Angela, get back!

24:52.892 --> 24:54.026
Casey, stay with me!

24:54.060 --> 24:55.461
Angela, please!
Stay with me!

24:55.494 --> 24:56.896
Casey, no!

24:56.929 --> 25:00.366
MARCUS:
You have no authority but
that which is given.

25:00.399 --> 25:02.001
Casey!

25:02.034 --> 25:03.970
I firmly resolve,
with the help of Thy grace,

25:04.003 --> 25:06.706
to confess my sins,
to do penance,

25:06.739 --> 25:10.843
and to amend my life!
Amen.

25:10.877 --> 25:14.013
He has borne our weakness
and endured our suffering.

25:14.046 --> 25:16.415
He will reward you
with eternal life.

25:16.448 --> 25:18.551
I confess to Almighty God,

25:18.585 --> 25:20.419
and to you,
my brothers and sisters,

25:20.452 --> 25:22.488
that I have greatly sinned,

25:22.521 --> 25:23.890
in my thoughts
and in my words.

25:23.923 --> 25:26.659
In what I have done and
what I have failed to do.

25:26.693 --> 25:29.095
Through my fault!
Through my fault!

25:29.128 --> 25:30.997
Through my most grievous fault.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.332
(shouting):
I confess!

25:33.365 --> 25:35.267
(demonic growling)

25:36.603 --> 25:37.704
(gasping)

25:43.375 --> 25:45.945
(groaning, growling)

25:47.814 --> 25:49.982
Return to me!

26:15.407 --> 26:17.409
(gasps)

26:17.443 --> 26:18.645
(normal voice):
Mom?

26:18.678 --> 26:20.446
Casey?

26:21.648 --> 26:23.082
(whimpers)

26:23.115 --> 26:24.350
Casey!

26:28.187 --> 26:30.122
(both crying)

26:31.858 --> 26:33.192
ANGELA:
Casey.

26:43.102 --> 26:44.937
Oh, Casey.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.631
(siren blaring)

27:25.544 --> 27:27.947
(excited crowd chatter)

27:27.980 --> 27:30.382
*

27:57.576 --> 27:59.946
*

28:28.908 --> 28:31.277
*

28:33.780 --> 28:35.782
(siren blaring)

28:37.449 --> 28:39.451
*

28:41.253 --> 28:43.722
(indistinct chatter)

28:51.430 --> 28:53.565
SWAT LEADER: Move! Move in!
Okay, go!

28:59.171 --> 29:01.774
Clear!
Clear.

29:02.909 --> 29:05.244
Hallway's clear!

29:11.984 --> 29:15.087
(men speaking indistinctly)

29:16.622 --> 29:17.957
(door kicked in)

29:17.990 --> 29:20.459
Gun, gun, gun!
Drop the weapon!

29:20.492 --> 29:22.028
Drop the weapon!

29:23.595 --> 29:26.298
Can you hear the angels?

29:26.332 --> 29:29.001
Can you hear them singing?

29:29.035 --> 29:30.669
(gunshot)

29:36.708 --> 29:38.811
(monitor beeping)

29:47.119 --> 29:48.855
DETECTIVE LAWRENCE:
Mr. Rance.

29:48.888 --> 29:51.991
I'm gonna need to talk to her
the second she's alert.

29:52.024 --> 29:54.693
You can talk
to our lawyer first.

29:54.726 --> 29:56.963
But I'm also gonna
talk to your daughter.

29:56.996 --> 29:59.165
It's gonna happen,
Mr. Rance.

29:59.198 --> 30:00.699
It's happening.

30:00.732 --> 30:05.171
She's a 100-pound girl.
She didn't do it.

30:05.204 --> 30:06.638
So why the lawyer?

30:17.649 --> 30:20.186
(both sigh)

30:20.219 --> 30:22.889
Is she gonna be okay?

30:22.922 --> 30:26.192
I think the Rance girls are
a couple of tough cookies.

30:26.225 --> 30:28.494
That's what I think.

30:30.729 --> 30:34.566
When this is done,

30:34.600 --> 30:37.203
you should give some serious
thought to what Chris said.

30:37.236 --> 30:39.371
About California.

30:39.405 --> 30:41.140
I thought we were going
to be Canadians.

30:41.173 --> 30:44.310
Or Venezuelans.
Maybe us.

30:44.343 --> 30:49.315
You...You were always
gonna be somewhere else.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.217
It's just a matter
of when.

30:52.751 --> 30:54.820
Your grandma's
a movie star.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.322
It's so weird.

30:56.355 --> 30:57.589
(chuckles):
I know.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.660
But she knows people
who can help you.

31:01.693 --> 31:04.196
I'll think about it.

31:04.230 --> 31:05.531
Okay.

31:05.564 --> 31:07.766
You're getting better, dad.

31:07.799 --> 31:09.435
You've been sharp.

31:09.468 --> 31:11.470
Ditto.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.545
*

31:28.587 --> 31:30.089
* In the midnight hour

31:30.122 --> 31:31.723
(crowd cheering)

31:31.757 --> 31:34.393
* Love's coming on strong

31:34.426 --> 31:36.195
* Thoughts of you are creeping

31:36.228 --> 31:37.964
MARCUS:
You asked me what
God sounds like,

31:37.997 --> 31:40.032
what He looks like.

31:40.066 --> 31:41.400
That is God.

31:41.433 --> 31:43.402
* Love so heavy, love so sweet

31:43.435 --> 31:46.072
Really?
* Thoughts of you baby
made me weak in my knees *

31:46.105 --> 31:51.277
I thought He was more like
a six-piece mariachi band.

31:51.310 --> 31:53.112
Did you just take the piss?

31:53.145 --> 31:55.581
(laughs)

31:55.614 --> 31:57.449
You did.

31:57.483 --> 31:59.718
Tomas Ortega told a joke.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.087
Oh, no, no, no.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.888
For the record,
I tell jokes all the time,

32:02.921 --> 32:04.490
you just don't understand them.

32:04.523 --> 32:06.425
Oh, is that right?
All this time?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:06.458 --> 32:08.060
Every single time.
Oh, okay.

32:08.094 --> 32:09.561
They go right over your head.
Yeah.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.130
Very sophisticated humor,
my friend.

32:11.163 --> 32:14.133
(both chuckle)

32:17.703 --> 32:20.506
It's really over, isn't it?

32:21.707 --> 32:23.475
Doesn't have to be.

32:23.509 --> 32:26.112
You can make a go of this,
you know.
Hmm.

32:26.145 --> 32:29.481
Being an exorcist.

32:29.515 --> 32:31.283
You're not all rubbish.

32:31.317 --> 32:32.518
Well, I thought you said

32:32.551 --> 32:35.654
an exorcist had to give up...

32:35.687 --> 32:38.124
family, friends.

32:40.126 --> 32:42.328
Love.

32:42.361 --> 32:44.530
Yeah, well, you do.

32:44.563 --> 32:46.999
But you get to see the world.
Mm.

32:47.033 --> 32:48.434
Live out of a bag.

32:48.467 --> 32:51.137
(chuckles)

32:51.170 --> 32:52.404
Cheers.

32:54.506 --> 32:56.208
To Casey Rance.

32:56.242 --> 32:57.543
To...

32:57.576 --> 32:59.845
standing in the doorway

32:59.878 --> 33:02.148
and pushing back the night.

33:02.181 --> 33:03.982
Yours is better.

33:04.016 --> 33:06.018
(chuckles)

33:09.821 --> 33:11.190
Ooh.

33:11.223 --> 33:13.125
Got to go.
Got to go.

33:13.159 --> 33:16.062
Oh, come on, how can
you walk out on this goddess?

33:16.095 --> 33:17.563
We should close the place down.

33:17.596 --> 33:19.331
Get in a bar fight.

33:25.371 --> 33:27.373
Next time, my friend.

33:29.275 --> 33:30.576
(chuckles)

33:36.348 --> 33:40.052
A la próxima...

33:40.086 --> 33:41.520
hermano.

33:41.553 --> 33:44.890
* Never knew why
I loved you so *

33:44.923 --> 33:47.993
* Never did understand

33:48.026 --> 33:49.895
* Felt like lightning

33:49.928 --> 33:51.263
* Felt like quicksand

33:51.297 --> 33:52.264
* Loving you, baby

33:52.298 --> 33:59.105
* Wasn't in my plan...

33:59.138 --> 34:01.140
(guitar solo)

34:22.961 --> 34:24.963
(siren wails in the distance)

35:14.480 --> 35:16.248
What are

35:16.282 --> 35:20.719
their names, Father Bennett?

35:21.887 --> 35:23.655
(grunting)

35:36.067 --> 35:38.370
(rustling slows, grunting stops)

35:46.011 --> 35:48.013
(siren wailing in the distance)

35:50.482 --> 35:52.484
*

36:08.834 --> 36:10.402
Hola.

36:18.109 --> 36:19.378
(crying):
I'm sorry.

36:25.917 --> 36:27.519
Jim.

36:27.553 --> 36:29.355
We haven't met.

36:32.057 --> 36:33.759
Well, that's rude.

36:33.792 --> 36:35.261
You do know who I am, yeah?

36:35.294 --> 36:37.329
I mean, you've been
in my house, in...

36:37.363 --> 36:39.765
in my bed.

36:43.535 --> 36:45.571
Yes, I know.

36:46.938 --> 36:48.206
I came home and
he was just there.

36:48.240 --> 36:49.608
It's okay.

36:51.743 --> 36:53.679
JIM:
So,

36:53.712 --> 36:55.914
how many times did
you sleep with my wife?

36:59.318 --> 37:01.287
Does it matter?

37:04.923 --> 37:07.092
You know, she always
used to talk about you.

37:07.125 --> 37:08.527
"He's such a nice guy.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.696
"Oh, we're just friends.

37:10.729 --> 37:13.131
He's probably homosexual
just like the others."

37:15.501 --> 37:17.503
She hid you good.

37:21.340 --> 37:25.311
You hide too, behind
that little white collar.

37:28.747 --> 37:31.149
(Velcro rips)

37:35.321 --> 37:36.555
So,

37:36.588 --> 37:39.057
who's hiding now?

37:39.090 --> 37:40.492
Leave him alone.

37:40.526 --> 37:42.160
You want to hit me?
I'm just telling you,

37:42.193 --> 37:43.895
I'm right here.

37:43.929 --> 37:45.130
You want me to be the guy

37:45.163 --> 37:46.832
who beats up a priest in church?

37:46.865 --> 37:49.167
I am right here.

37:52.270 --> 37:53.605
No.

37:53.639 --> 37:56.675
No, what I'm gonna do is

37:56.708 --> 38:00.612
I'm going to make a call
to your boss, or bishop,

38:00.646 --> 38:03.449
or whatever the hell he is,
and I'm gonna see how he feels

38:03.482 --> 38:07.185
about the whole priest
committing adultery thing.

38:07.218 --> 38:10.822
My guess, not too happy.

38:16.227 --> 38:19.365
I'm sorry.

38:19.398 --> 38:21.533
I never...

38:21.567 --> 38:23.569
never meant for any...

38:32.878 --> 38:34.780
I'll take care of this.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.948
I promise.

38:36.982 --> 38:40.786
(footsteps receding)

38:40.819 --> 38:42.821
*

38:48.694 --> 38:50.396
Now, local police are
not answering questions

38:50.429 --> 38:53.499
at the moment,
but neighbors say Mr. Harplen

38:53.532 --> 38:54.500
was a bit of a recluse.
(phone dialing)

38:54.533 --> 38:55.501
He lived in the apartment

38:55.534 --> 38:56.868
for a little over a month...

38:56.902 --> 38:59.638
Be damned, Bennett was right.
(phone ringing)

38:59.671 --> 39:02.574
Like he wasn't insufferable
to begin with.

39:02.608 --> 39:04.376
Speaking of,

39:04.410 --> 39:06.378
someone isn't answering
his phone.

39:06.412 --> 39:08.079
...if bombs or
bomb-making materials

39:08.113 --> 39:09.648
were found in the apartment

39:09.681 --> 39:11.583
as of yet, but we do have
reason to believe...

39:11.617 --> 39:13.351
I met him,

39:13.385 --> 39:16.488
John Harplen.

39:16.522 --> 39:18.890
He was living under a tarp,
shoes hanging off his feet.

39:18.924 --> 39:21.359
We also believe that Harplen
was acting alone...

39:21.393 --> 39:23.194
How does a man like that
afford a 20 grand's-worth

39:23.228 --> 39:25.397
of military-grade hardware?

39:25.431 --> 39:27.032
Are you saying he's a patsy?

39:27.065 --> 39:28.266
But again...

39:28.299 --> 39:31.102
I'm saying this isn't over.

39:44.916 --> 39:46.952
You think it'll hurt the resale?

39:46.985 --> 39:49.521
(chuckles)

39:49.555 --> 39:51.256
Can I help you?

39:51.289 --> 39:52.758
No, it's just hard to figure out

39:52.791 --> 39:54.926
what to take and what to leave.

39:54.960 --> 39:57.563
Henry says we could send
a moving company for the rest,

39:57.596 --> 39:59.731
but we're gonna be fugitives,

39:59.765 --> 40:03.569
so that's laughable.

40:03.602 --> 40:05.103
You could always stay
and fight it.

40:05.136 --> 40:06.972
I'm sure you could find
one member of a jury

40:07.005 --> 40:09.975
who believes
in demonic possession.

40:10.008 --> 40:12.478
(chuckles)

40:12.511 --> 40:13.745
Sorry.

40:13.779 --> 40:14.980
Too soon.

40:15.013 --> 40:17.983
It just seems crazy

40:18.016 --> 40:21.720
that I'm walking away
from my whole life, again.

40:21.753 --> 40:23.989
But this time you have
your family with you, honey.

40:24.022 --> 40:25.557
You have me.

40:25.591 --> 40:27.559
Sure.
We could cross-stitch

40:27.593 --> 40:31.830
pillows together that say,
"Mom, a girl's best friend."

40:31.863 --> 40:34.232
Look, I know this is
still new, Rags, but...

40:34.265 --> 40:35.934
Or we could burn our mouths
on this soup

40:35.967 --> 40:38.436
that you and I make
from scratch.

40:38.470 --> 40:40.772
And I know that we have
to build up trust,

40:40.806 --> 40:42.240
but if you ju...
While Casey and-and Kat

40:42.273 --> 40:46.244
prepare to pass along
their rancid MacNeil genes.

40:46.277 --> 40:48.747
(music box plays tune)

40:48.780 --> 40:50.148
Fine.

40:50.181 --> 40:52.518
Forget I said anything.

40:52.551 --> 40:54.653
Aw.

40:54.686 --> 40:58.790
I am gonna forget everything
that you ever said to me.

40:58.824 --> 41:00.792
You little stinkpot.

41:00.826 --> 41:02.828
*

41:07.666 --> 41:08.934
(whispers):
You.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.468
(gasps, then bone cracks)

41:28.486 --> 41:30.488
