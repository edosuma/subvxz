00:00.242 --> 00:02.665
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.265 --> 00:05.799
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.368 --> 00:09.669
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:09.737 --> 00:11.938
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:12.006 --> 00:14.341
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.408 --> 00:16.242
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.309 --> 00:19.045
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:19.113 --> 00:21.147
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:22.250 --> 00:23.617
<i>A trigger-happy girlfriend...</i>

00:23.684 --> 00:25.252
Should we shoot them?

00:25.319 --> 00:27.053
<i>...an old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:27.121 --> 00:29.823
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:29.891 --> 00:32.192
<i>...family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:32.259 --> 00:34.127
<i>...if you're desperate....</i>
<i>Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:34.195 --> 00:37.264
<i>...and a down-and-out spy</i>
<i>you met along the way.</i>

00:37.331 --> 00:38.899
That's how we do it,
people.

00:38.966 --> 00:41.568
<i>Bottom line --</i>
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:41.636 --> 00:43.403
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

00:46.595 --> 00:48.483
I know where
we can find Anson Fullerton.

00:48.484 --> 00:49.130
Excuse me?

00:49.131 --> 00:50.431
He's picking up
a package tomorrow

00:50.499 --> 00:51.999
in a motel
in Atlantic City.

00:53.776 --> 00:55.710
Nate, you're the only one
who can get to Anson

00:55.778 --> 00:57.512
before he escapes.

00:59.081 --> 01:01.149
Get up. Get up!

01:01.216 --> 01:03.351
- We got him, man.
- It is about time.

01:07.489 --> 01:09.890
No! Nate!

01:09.958 --> 01:13.127
Nate!

01:13.195 --> 01:14.962
I need to find
who killed my brother.

01:14.997 --> 01:16.097
I'm not
giving up on this.

01:16.164 --> 01:17.665
I did some poking
around the FBI.

01:17.733 --> 01:19.000
Turns out a buddy
at the bureau

01:19.067 --> 01:21.736
might be willing
to share Nate's file on the D.L.

01:21.803 --> 01:23.938
If you can get that FBI file
on Nate's murder,

01:24.006 --> 01:25.273
I can run down leads
with Jesse.

01:25.340 --> 01:27.074
The sniper rifle
used to kill Nate

01:27.142 --> 01:28.376
was made
by Meyerson Industries.

01:28.443 --> 01:30.411
If we find that gun,
that'd be a good start.

01:30.479 --> 01:32.346
We can't just ask them
who they sold their gun to.

01:32.414 --> 01:33.614
Well, not directly,

01:33.682 --> 01:35.049
but there are other ways
to get information.

01:35.117 --> 01:37.318
Like?
Blackmail.

01:37.386 --> 01:40.054
The V.P. of sales
is the son of the founder.

01:40.122 --> 01:42.790
He's a blackmailer's dream.
He loves to par-tay.

01:43.121 --> 01:44.821
- Are you blackmailing me?
- Yeah.

01:44.889 --> 01:47.090
So what do you want?

01:47.158 --> 01:48.926
I want the records of every sniper rifle
you sold in the last 12 months.

01:48.993 --> 01:52.763
The sale order shows the gun
was shipped to the Pryon Group.

01:52.830 --> 01:55.599
It's a private security firm
upstate.

01:55.770 --> 01:58.605
And whoever took that gun
used it to shoot Nate.

01:58.673 --> 02:00.840
If we can find out
who had access to that gun,

02:00.908 --> 02:02.575
we can find Nate's killer.

02:04.478 --> 02:05.679
Boom.

02:05.746 --> 02:07.414
Everything there is to know
about Jack Vale,

02:07.481 --> 02:08.848
the C.E.O.
of the Pryon Group.

02:08.916 --> 02:10.517
Now, the good news is,
Vale's security is airtight,

02:10.584 --> 02:12.252
so there's no way
that gun just walked off

02:12.319 --> 02:13.553
one of his
training facilities.

02:13.621 --> 02:14.988
Which means the man
who killed Nate

02:15.056 --> 02:17.691
will be
on the books somewhere.

02:17.758 --> 02:19.359
We need to
get into their system.

02:19.427 --> 02:20.760
We have approximately
a snowball's chance in hell

02:20.828 --> 02:22.262
of getting past
that firewall.

02:22.329 --> 02:24.831
Vale's system makes the Pentagon
look like Disneyland.

02:24.899 --> 02:26.766
Then we skip the computers
and we go directly to Vale.

02:26.834 --> 02:31.071
Sounds good, but how do you
approach a guy like that?

02:31.138 --> 02:32.906
Probably best to go in

02:32.973 --> 02:35.108
as someone in the market
for private military services.

02:35.176 --> 02:38.011
Do you think that you could
set up a dummy corporation?

02:38.079 --> 02:41.014
Sure, but the thing is,
even if we get Mike the meeting,

02:41.082 --> 02:42.582
Vale's a guy who hangs out
with billionaires,

02:42.650 --> 02:44.050
you know,
with a "B."

02:44.118 --> 02:46.352
Well, I was hoping we could
talk to your girlfriend,

02:46.420 --> 02:48.221
help me look the part?

02:48.289 --> 02:51.024
I just need to
borrow a few accessories.

02:51.092 --> 02:53.960
I hate this
so much already.

02:54.028 --> 02:56.796
<i>When you're posing</i>
<i>as a potential client</i>

02:56.864 --> 03:00.200
<i>of a private military company,</i>
<i>it doesn't pay to be subtle.</i>

03:00.267 --> 03:03.203
<i>A private army</i>
<i>is a very high-dollar item,</i>

03:03.270 --> 03:05.405
<i>and the people who rent them</i>
<i>tend to be super-rich</i>

03:05.473 --> 03:07.607
<i>and not afraid to show it.</i>

03:07.675 --> 03:09.175
<i>It's an expensive cover I.D.</i>

03:09.243 --> 03:11.778
<i>But if you do it right,</i>
<i>it's worth every penny.</i>

03:11.846 --> 03:15.181
<i>You want your target focused</i>
<i>less on your credentials</i>

03:15.249 --> 03:17.083
<i>and more</i>
<i>on the make of your watch</i>

03:17.151 --> 03:20.420
<i>and the size of your wallet.</i>

03:20.488 --> 03:21.988
Mr. Krueger?

03:22.056 --> 03:23.089
Jack Vale.
Good to meet you.

03:23.157 --> 03:24.724
And you must be...

03:24.792 --> 03:26.593
Charles Finley,
Mr. Krueger's associate.

03:26.660 --> 03:28.027
This is Andrew Thompson.

03:28.095 --> 03:29.963
He's my regional manager
for the eastern seaboard.

03:30.030 --> 03:32.132
He'll be handling the day-to-day
of your account.

03:32.199 --> 03:33.500
It's good to meet you.

03:33.567 --> 03:35.301
It's a beautiful machine
you have there.

03:35.369 --> 03:37.604
You should see it
at 180 miles an hour.

03:38.939 --> 03:40.807
Really appreciate you guys
coming down to Miami.

03:40.875 --> 03:43.576
No problem at all.
How long you all been down here?

03:43.644 --> 03:45.278
I'm surprised I haven't
heard of your outfit.

03:45.346 --> 03:46.613
I take that
as a compliment.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.882
Not being heard of
is part of our business model.

03:48.949 --> 03:50.717
Mine, too.

03:50.785 --> 03:53.119
Well, drinks ain't gonna
find us.

03:53.187 --> 03:54.320
Shall we sit?

03:57.758 --> 04:00.426
We've had insurgents
firing on our oil fields

04:00.494 --> 04:02.061
from a mile out,
Mr. Vale.

04:02.129 --> 04:04.731
Can your outfit
handle that kind of thing?

04:04.799 --> 04:06.800
Engaging at that distance
won't be a problem.

04:06.867 --> 04:08.835
Got snipers who can shoot
the tail feathers off a hawk

04:08.903 --> 04:10.236
from two miles away.

04:10.304 --> 04:12.806
Perfect. When can I review
my personnel options?

04:14.308 --> 04:16.509
That's a bit sticky,
I'm afraid.

04:16.577 --> 04:19.312
We've got a strict
confidentiality policy.

04:19.380 --> 04:21.880
Protects the employees
and the client.

04:21.949 --> 04:25.852
We understand that, sir. We're
just not comfortable with it.

04:25.920 --> 04:28.221
Listen, if you want grunts
with guns, you don't need Pryon.

04:28.289 --> 04:29.622
I get the best in the world

04:29.690 --> 04:32.325
because they trust me
to protect their privacy.

04:32.393 --> 04:33.793
But I promise you,

04:33.861 --> 04:37.297
I can and will build a team
that meets your needs.

04:37.364 --> 04:41.601
Mr. Vale, when I'm about to give
a man a $42 million contract,

04:41.669 --> 04:44.470
I expect to see
what my money pays for.

04:44.538 --> 04:46.372
Now, if you're uncomfortable
with that,

04:46.440 --> 04:48.041
I can take my business
elsewhere.

04:56.483 --> 04:58.952
That's too bad.
Charles.

04:59.019 --> 05:00.687
Hold on, now.
Hold on.

05:00.754 --> 05:02.689
My mama
raised a reasonable man.

05:02.756 --> 05:04.324
Tell you what.

05:04.391 --> 05:05.625
I'll have Thompson here

05:05.693 --> 05:07.660
take you around
one of our facilities.

05:07.728 --> 05:09.262
South Carolina's
training now.

05:09.330 --> 05:10.563
Perfect.

05:10.631 --> 05:12.999
That way you can see
how our men prepare for duty.

05:13.067 --> 05:14.434
Should put your minds
at ease.

05:14.501 --> 05:15.935
That would be acceptable.

05:16.003 --> 05:18.671
Good.
Thompson will be in touch.

05:18.739 --> 05:21.841
Lunch
is taken care of.

05:23.310 --> 05:26.479
"Acceptable"?

05:26.547 --> 05:27.714
Mike, unless we happen to
run into somebody

05:27.781 --> 05:29.015
with a name tag that says,

05:29.083 --> 05:30.950
"Hi, my name is the guy
that killed Nate,"

05:31.018 --> 05:32.452
this tour's gonna be
a waste of time.

05:32.519 --> 05:33.820
Maybe not.

05:33.888 --> 05:36.623
Thompson was eyeing my Rolex
like he wanted to eat it.

05:36.690 --> 05:37.957
You think
he's the weak link?

05:38.025 --> 05:39.659
He looks pretty breakable
to me.

05:39.727 --> 05:42.328
Hello, Michael.

05:42.396 --> 05:44.631
Fi, how does a weekend
in South Carolina sound?

05:44.698 --> 05:47.333
It's not Paris,
but there will be lots of guns.

05:47.401 --> 05:50.703
Sounds lovely,
but we may not be available.

05:50.771 --> 05:53.873
Guess who just dropped by
for a visit -- the CIA.

05:56.043 --> 05:57.010
What? Who?

05:57.077 --> 05:58.645
Manaro and Bailey.

05:58.712 --> 06:01.247
Now, are they not
the same two idiots

06:01.315 --> 06:02.782
that nearly got Sam killed?

06:02.850 --> 06:04.417
Put them on speaker.

06:04.485 --> 06:06.753
I don't know what you guys
are trying to drag me into.

06:06.820 --> 06:09.589
But, Manaro,
forget it. I'm busy.

06:09.657 --> 06:11.925
We're not here to drag you
into anything, Westen.

06:11.992 --> 06:14.193
We're here
for our newest asset.

06:14.261 --> 06:15.328
Newest asset?

06:15.396 --> 06:17.263
Manaro,
what are you talking about?

06:17.331 --> 06:20.733
I'm talking about your
girlfriend, Fiona Glenanne.

06:21.652 --> 06:25.652
<font color=#00FF00>Burn Notice 6x0</font>

Original Air Date on August 16, 2012

06:25.653 --> 06:29.653
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

06:32.403 --> 06:34.754
Fi isn't working for you.
End of story.

06:34.833 --> 06:36.334
Damn straight.

06:36.402 --> 06:38.136
You guys almost
got me killed twice.

06:38.203 --> 06:39.704
And now
you're coming after Fi?

06:39.772 --> 06:42.240
Back off. Axe, this is
none of your business.

06:42.308 --> 06:44.442
The hell it isn't!
She's my friend, too.

06:44.510 --> 06:45.743
And last time I checked,

06:45.811 --> 06:47.478
I'm the resident expert
on you two idiots.

06:47.546 --> 06:49.380
You remember Colombia?
Do you remember that?

06:49.448 --> 06:50.381
Yeah. Yeah.

06:50.449 --> 06:52.016
I-I remember
you shot at me,

06:52.084 --> 06:53.651
pretty much got us kicked out of our jobs...
Tied us up, uh...

06:53.719 --> 06:55.253
...stole our helicopter
...For a couple months there.

06:55.321 --> 06:56.521
And then
I saved your sorry butts.

06:56.588 --> 06:58.389
And let's not forget,

06:58.457 --> 07:00.091
I got back
your damn predator drone.

07:00.159 --> 07:02.894
Oh --
Who loses a predator drone?!

07:02.962 --> 07:05.029
Guys, guys, guys!

07:05.097 --> 07:07.565
You're wrong.
Unfortunately.

07:07.633 --> 07:09.300
They <i>can</i> make me
work for them.

07:09.368 --> 07:10.234
What are you
talking about?

07:12.071 --> 07:15.807
This contract that she signed
in order to get out of prison

07:15.874 --> 07:18.643
says she works
for the CIA whenever we want.

07:18.711 --> 07:20.712
Maybe Agent Pearce
let it slide,

07:20.779 --> 07:22.647
but she's
not around anymore.

07:22.715 --> 07:24.882
So, Glenanne either
works with us

07:24.950 --> 07:27.051
or she goes
back to prison.

07:27.119 --> 07:28.486
Any questions?

07:28.554 --> 07:30.755
Good.

07:32.691 --> 07:34.492
This is Vincent Durov.

07:34.560 --> 07:36.761
He runs an aerospace company
in the Ukraine,

07:36.829 --> 07:38.496
and he takes his winters here
on South Beach.

07:38.564 --> 07:40.064
He's dabbled
in the black market for years --

07:40.132 --> 07:42.000
spare parts, engines.

07:42.067 --> 07:43.901
But he never sold
to terrorists or enemy nations.

07:43.969 --> 07:47.138
Something tells me
that has changed.

07:47.206 --> 07:48.706
We have an asset who tells us
he's about to sell

07:48.774 --> 07:51.576
some highly sensitive ballistics
tech to some very bad people.

07:51.643 --> 07:53.878
But our asset doesn't know
who's buying or when.

07:53.946 --> 07:55.980
So we got to
do this quick.

07:56.048 --> 07:57.648
Durov leaves Miami
on Tuesday,

07:57.716 --> 08:00.752
so we need the what, when,
and where on this deal by then.

08:00.819 --> 08:03.688
Your asset got you this far,
why do you need me?

08:03.756 --> 08:06.724
The intel is in his safe.
Our asset is his girlfriend.

08:06.792 --> 08:08.726
Cute, but not much
of a safe-cracker.

08:08.794 --> 08:10.294
This isn't about
cracking a safe.

08:10.362 --> 08:11.662
If it was,
you wouldn't be here.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.501
We already
sent in a field op,

08:16.568 --> 08:19.337
but he, uh...
washed up on Miami Beach

08:19.405 --> 08:21.706
with an extra hole
in his head.

08:21.774 --> 08:24.208
Wait, Durov already knows
that someone's after him,

08:24.276 --> 08:26.611
and you expect me
to pull this off by Tuesday?

08:26.678 --> 08:29.514
It'll be fine. We'll support you.
We'll have your back.

08:29.581 --> 08:31.649
Yeah, until she's no longer
mission critical.

08:31.717 --> 08:33.518
Then you'll run like scared,
little girls.

08:33.585 --> 08:35.953
Sam, don't worry.

08:36.020 --> 08:37.321
They won't be the only ones
supporting her.

08:37.389 --> 08:38.889
I'm in on this job
with you.

08:39.792 --> 08:41.692
No.
I said I'm in.

08:41.760 --> 08:45.196
Jesse and I can deal
with all the other stuff.

08:46.899 --> 08:48.466
Fine.

08:48.534 --> 08:50.768
Just stay out of our way,
let us do our job.

08:50.836 --> 08:52.670
Do your job
and there won't be a problem.

08:55.774 --> 09:00.044
<i>One of the biggest challenges</i>
<i>in covert operations</i>

09:00.112 --> 09:01.779
<i>is working</i>
<i>with civilian assets.</i>

09:03.415 --> 09:05.016
<i>It's often as much about</i>

09:05.084 --> 09:07.351
<i>keeping the asset</i>
<i>from falling apart</i>

09:07.419 --> 09:09.120
<i>as it is</i>
<i>about gathering intelligence.</i>

09:09.188 --> 09:13.191
<i>Kind of like babysitting,</i>
<i>only with a gun to your head.</i>

09:13.258 --> 09:15.893
Listen to me.
Relax. Act normal.

09:15.961 --> 09:18.629
You don't understand. I didn't
sign up for any of this.

09:18.697 --> 09:20.064
Believe me,
I do understand.

09:20.132 --> 09:21.332
They're gonna
get me killed.

09:21.400 --> 09:22.967
I'll get you out
the minute the job is done.

09:23.035 --> 09:24.235
I promise.
Yeah?

09:24.303 --> 09:26.204
I've heard that before
from the last guy,

09:26.271 --> 09:27.238
and now he's dead.

09:27.306 --> 09:28.306
And you're alive.

09:28.373 --> 09:29.440
Durov
underestimates you.

09:29.508 --> 09:31.109
Chances are,
he'll underestimate me, too.

09:31.176 --> 09:34.378
Look, as long as you help me
sell this, we'll be fine.

09:34.446 --> 09:35.980
Now, I reviewed your history
on the way over here.

09:36.048 --> 09:38.049
You modeled in Milan?

09:38.117 --> 09:39.617
Two years ago.
Good.

09:39.685 --> 09:42.120
I did some, uh...
some work there myself.

09:42.187 --> 09:43.554
I know the city well.

09:43.622 --> 09:45.490
We'll tell Durov that
we worked in fashion together

09:45.557 --> 09:47.692
and I need a place to stay
for a few days.

09:47.759 --> 09:50.194
Can you do that?

09:50.262 --> 09:51.162
Salud.

09:54.566 --> 09:57.702
<i>For a spy,</i>
<i>deep-cover assignments</i>

09:57.769 --> 10:00.671
<i>often mean going into enemy</i>
<i>territory alone and unarmed.</i>

10:00.739 --> 10:03.374
<i>If you want to survive,</i>
<i>you better have a support team</i>

10:03.442 --> 10:05.476
<i>you can trust</i>
<i>watching your back.</i>

10:05.544 --> 10:08.646
All right.
Mics and cameras are hot.

10:14.086 --> 10:16.554
Angie.

10:16.622 --> 10:18.456
Phoebe, I'm so glad
you're here.

10:18.524 --> 10:20.558
You look fantastic.
So do you.

10:20.626 --> 10:22.660
It's good to see you.
You good?

10:22.728 --> 10:24.095
- You're doing great.
- Ma'am, stay here.

10:24.163 --> 10:25.329
We're gonna have to
search you.

10:25.397 --> 10:26.731
They just have to
look through your stuff.

10:26.798 --> 10:28.166
Vincent's rules.

10:28.233 --> 10:30.535
You think the guards are buying
their girlfriend routine?

10:30.602 --> 10:31.602
They got this.

10:31.670 --> 10:32.904
Yeah,
a security thing.

10:32.971 --> 10:34.405
He'll tell you all about
how top secret his work is

10:34.473 --> 10:35.506
if you ask him,
but I wouldn't.

10:35.574 --> 10:36.641
Boring.

10:38.377 --> 10:40.645
<i>Modifications like</i>
<i>nitrous-oxide injectors</i>

10:40.712 --> 10:43.314
<i>and ultra-light, carbon-fiber</i>
<i>bodywork are great in movies,</i>

10:43.382 --> 10:44.715
<i>but in real life,</i>

10:44.783 --> 10:47.818
<i>spies need cars</i>
<i>that won't raise suspicions</i>

10:47.886 --> 10:49.487
<i>if they're searched.</i>

10:49.555 --> 10:51.155
<i>The speed, power,</i>
<i>and handling you need</i>

10:51.223 --> 10:52.657
<i>had better come</i>
<i>factory installed</i>

10:52.724 --> 10:55.326
<i>because if the wrong person</i>
<i>gets curious,</i>

10:55.394 --> 10:57.595
<i>it could mean a bullet</i>
<i>to the head.</i>

10:57.663 --> 10:59.564
Arms up, please, miss.
I need to pat you down.

10:59.631 --> 11:02.166
Antonio,
I can handle this.

11:04.000 --> 11:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here

11:11.443 --> 11:13.544
Hey, baby.
This is Phoebe.

11:13.612 --> 11:18.449
Pleasure.
It's nice to meet you.

11:18.517 --> 11:21.018
Angie's told me all about
her prince charming.

11:21.086 --> 11:24.956
I'm no prince, but I can
occasionally be charming.

11:25.023 --> 11:27.124
I must apologize
for the security.

11:27.192 --> 11:29.193
I'm afraid it's become
a necessity.

11:42.975 --> 11:45.509
She's clean.

11:45.577 --> 11:46.911
I checked
every inch of her.

11:52.985 --> 11:54.619
Looks like she's in.

11:56.922 --> 11:58.723
<i>The private-military industry</i>

11:58.790 --> 12:02.994
<i>is worth $100 billion a year</i>
<i>worldwide and growing.</i>

12:03.061 --> 12:05.496
<i>It's secretive, well-armed,</i>
<i>and almost completely</i>

12:05.564 --> 12:07.498
<i>unregulated</i>
<i>by international law,</i>

12:07.566 --> 12:10.701
<i>which is great if you need</i>
<i>to hire your own private army,</i>

12:10.769 --> 12:12.003
<i>but not so good if you need</i>

12:12.070 --> 12:13.971
<i>to steal</i>
<i>their classified intelligence,</i>

12:14.039 --> 12:15.840
<i>which means sometimes</i>
<i>you have to rely</i>

12:15.907 --> 12:17.875
<i>on your powers of persuasion.</i>

12:17.943 --> 12:20.211
Of course,
this is just one of our camps.

12:20.279 --> 12:23.047
Our men also cycle through
our urban and desert training.

12:23.115 --> 12:24.915
Yes, it's a rigorous
training program.

12:24.983 --> 12:26.817
I can see that.
But it won't be enough.

12:26.885 --> 12:29.520
My boss is still gonna need
to know more about your guys.

12:29.588 --> 12:31.522
I think Mr. Vale
was pretty clear.

12:31.590 --> 12:33.758
We don't reveal
the identities of our men.

12:34.960 --> 12:36.360
I knew this would be
a waste of time.

12:36.428 --> 12:37.728
Maybe. Maybe not

12:37.796 --> 12:40.097
look, I'm just --
I'm just thinking out loud here,

12:40.165 --> 12:43.668
but perhaps a side deal
could get this done,

12:43.735 --> 12:45.703
you know, a little, uh...
little arrangement.

12:45.771 --> 12:47.338
What are you
trying to say?

12:47.406 --> 12:48.806
Just that, you know,

12:48.874 --> 12:50.041
we can make this worth your
while, if you know what I mean.

12:50.108 --> 12:51.509
Yes, I do.

12:51.576 --> 12:52.810
You're trying to pay me off, aren't you?
Whoa --

12:52.878 --> 12:53.978
I mean, why would
you even suggest that?

12:54.046 --> 12:55.846
No one
is suggesting anything.

12:55.914 --> 12:58.249
My associate just misspoke,
that's all.

12:58.317 --> 13:01.319
Right. Well, make sure
you don't misspeak again.

13:01.386 --> 13:03.254
If Vale even suspected
something like this,

13:03.322 --> 13:04.822
I'd be a lot worse than fired.
Say no more.

13:04.890 --> 13:06.657
It's totally my bad.
I'm sorry.

13:06.725 --> 13:09.593
Oh, uh, you know, we may have to
finish this up tomorrow.

13:09.661 --> 13:12.096
Oh, yeah, we --
we have a conference call.

13:12.164 --> 13:13.431
We can meet you
in the afternoon.

13:15.534 --> 13:16.901
That can be arranged.

13:16.968 --> 13:19.003
Very good.
Thank you, sir.

13:22.107 --> 13:24.909
That went well. You think
he's gonna report us?

13:24.976 --> 13:26.243
Look, we'd have an M4
shoved in our faces

13:26.311 --> 13:27.712
if that's
what he was gonna do.

13:27.779 --> 13:30.147
No, let him feel self-righteous
for a night.

13:30.215 --> 13:32.750
It'll help us tomorrow.

13:38.757 --> 13:42.426
Okay, that guard
is staying put for a while.

13:42.494 --> 13:43.894
It's action time.

13:43.962 --> 13:45.062
Action time?

13:45.130 --> 13:46.931
Did they teach you that
at Langley?

13:46.998 --> 13:49.567
Just...call her,
Westen.

13:49.634 --> 13:51.402
Okay, I'm gonna
"action time" it now.

13:55.407 --> 13:56.774
Michael.

13:56.842 --> 13:59.076
Fi, you ready to make
the approach to the office?

13:59.144 --> 14:00.678
Ready. We clear?

14:00.746 --> 14:02.037
Yeah, we're about as clear
as we're gonna get.

14:02.062 --> 14:03.314
And Durov?

14:03.315 --> 14:04.982
He's in a meeting across town
until 4:00.

14:05.050 --> 14:07.318
You should be fine as long as
you don't fall asleep in there.

14:07.386 --> 14:08.586
If he catches us --

14:08.653 --> 14:09.920
we're gonna be fine.
Stay with me, okay?

14:09.988 --> 14:11.021
Yeah.

14:11.089 --> 14:12.757
You sure
we're clear?

14:12.824 --> 14:15.292
Once I start this,
I can't bail out.

14:15.360 --> 14:17.361
Just get in there,
Glenanne.

14:17.429 --> 14:20.030
<i>The easiest way to open a door</i>
<i>with an electric lock</i>

14:20.098 --> 14:22.032
<i>is to the cut the electricity,</i>

14:22.100 --> 14:24.668
<i>unless your target</i>
<i>has a fail-secure door</i>

14:24.736 --> 14:26.904
<i>designed to stay locked</i>
<i>during a power outage.</i>

14:26.972 --> 14:28.973
<i>To get past a fail-secure door,</i>

14:29.040 --> 14:31.575
<i>you can try to</i>
<i>steal the entry code,</i>

14:31.643 --> 14:34.445
<i>but if you have access to</i>
<i>the manufacturer's schematics,</i>

14:34.513 --> 14:37.481
<i>it's much easier</i>
<i>to wire in a duplicate circuit</i>

14:37.549 --> 14:39.216
<i>and trip the lock yourself.</i>

14:39.284 --> 14:40.384
Nice toys.

14:40.452 --> 14:41.786
I could get used to having

14:41.853 --> 14:43.587
a CIA tech team
at my beck and call.

14:43.655 --> 14:44.789
You two work freelance?

14:44.856 --> 14:47.792
No, Glenanne,
we work for the CIA.

14:47.859 --> 14:49.260
Of course,
if you worked freelance,

14:49.327 --> 14:50.428
you could afford
better suits.

14:52.297 --> 14:55.466
Michael, we're in.

14:55.534 --> 14:58.035
It's a reinforced
floor safe.

15:00.138 --> 15:02.306
The wheel is serrated
with false tumbler notches.

15:02.374 --> 15:03.541
I'm gonna have to
drill it.

15:03.608 --> 15:05.609
Think it might
have a relocker, too.

15:05.677 --> 15:07.545
If you can find
the serial number,

15:07.612 --> 15:09.480
we can get
the drill-point diagram.

15:09.548 --> 15:10.714
We're gonna have to.

15:10.782 --> 15:13.451
We're not gonna get in
any other way.

15:20.492 --> 15:22.126
What the hell is that?

15:24.696 --> 15:26.797
I think we have a problem.
I think that's Durov's car.

15:26.865 --> 15:29.633
That's definitely --
What?

15:29.701 --> 15:31.001
You said
he was at a meeting.

15:31.069 --> 15:32.903
He is. I mean,
he was supposed to be.

15:32.971 --> 15:34.305
We hacked his schedule!

15:34.372 --> 15:37.308
You didn't have anyone
surveilling the meeting?

15:37.375 --> 15:39.643
It is a multinational
computer-chip company.

15:39.711 --> 15:40.978
We don't have authorization
for that kind of surveillance.

15:45.250 --> 15:46.584
Fi, get out now.
Durov's back.

15:46.651 --> 15:47.885
What? Manaro said --

15:47.953 --> 15:49.887
Fi, they screwed up.

15:49.955 --> 15:53.390
Damn. Fi, Durov's
got his briefcase out.

15:53.458 --> 15:55.793
Chances are,
he's coming right at you,

15:55.861 --> 15:58.329
so get out of there now.
No, not until I get what I came for.

15:58.396 --> 15:59.597
I'm not gonna
do this again.

15:59.664 --> 16:01.165
What's going on?
CIA employs idiots.

16:01.233 --> 16:03.767
That's what's going on.
Durov's headed this way.

16:03.835 --> 16:05.703
Oh, my God.
Stay calm.

16:05.770 --> 16:07.505
You can't panic now.

16:07.572 --> 16:08.706
Fi!
I got it.

16:08.773 --> 16:12.276
Alpha-kilo-echo-
10128291.

16:12.344 --> 16:15.513
Got it.
Got it. Get out now. Go.

16:15.580 --> 16:17.882
If he sees us,
we're dead.

16:17.949 --> 16:20.217
Not if you help me
talk our way out of this.

16:20.285 --> 16:22.253
I told them
I'm not going to waste my time

16:22.320 --> 16:23.687
if they can't deliver.

16:23.755 --> 16:28.859
If he wants another meeting,
he can note his price.

16:28.927 --> 16:30.995
I'll call you back.

16:31.062 --> 16:32.863
There you are.

16:32.931 --> 16:33.998
Angela,
what are you doing here?

16:34.065 --> 16:35.232
How many times
have I told you

16:35.300 --> 16:37.434
this part of the house
is off limits?

16:37.502 --> 16:39.770
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

16:39.838 --> 16:42.172
Off limits?
Even to us?

16:42.240 --> 16:44.208
Yes,
especially for you.

16:44.276 --> 16:47.511
Who do you think you are
snooping around my office? I --

16:47.579 --> 16:50.814
No, no.
You've got the wrong idea.

16:50.882 --> 16:52.349
I-I'm sorry, baby.

16:52.417 --> 16:55.686
See, Phoebe just wanted you
to play with us,

16:55.754 --> 17:02.026
and you've been so nice
to let her stay, and...

17:02.093 --> 17:06.696
I think
she just got ideas.

17:09.401 --> 17:11.035
I'm a little embarrassed
right now.

17:11.102 --> 17:12.502
Just a little bit
embarrassed.

17:12.570 --> 17:15.606
I'm sorry.

17:15.674 --> 17:18.342
Angie and I
used to party a lot.

17:20.178 --> 17:27.417
I thought that we would just --
oh, God, I misunderstood you.

17:27.484 --> 17:30.888
There is a place for play
and a place for work.

17:30.956 --> 17:33.490
From now on,
you stay out of here.

17:33.558 --> 17:35.092
Mm.
Both of you.

17:35.160 --> 17:35.993
Mm-hmm.

17:39.364 --> 17:41.231
I promise.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.669
<i>Whether you're</i>
<i>in a market in Syria</i>

17:53.714 --> 17:56.916
<i>or a boutique in Miami,</i>
<i>getting supplies</i>

17:56.984 --> 17:59.952
<i>to operatives in the field</i>
<i>is always dangerous.</i>

18:00.020 --> 18:01.888
<i>Often you have to</i>
<i>spot a contact,</i>

18:01.955 --> 18:03.923
<i>arrange an excuse to approach,</i>
<i>and make a drop,</i>

18:03.991 --> 18:06.692
<i>and do it all while</i>

18:06.760 --> 18:08.961
<i>looking like you're just out</i>
<i>for a day's shopping.</i>

18:09.029 --> 18:11.898
Oh, you have to try this.
Oh, it's perfect.

18:11.965 --> 18:14.033
Go see
what Vincent thinks.

18:18.438 --> 18:21.374
Hey, baby, can you come
to the back with me?

18:21.441 --> 18:23.309
I need your opinion
on this dress.

18:27.681 --> 18:30.249
Where the hell
have you been?

18:30.317 --> 18:32.051
I've been dragging Durov
all over town.

18:32.119 --> 18:33.386
Drill-point diagrams
take time.

18:33.453 --> 18:35.855
Go to Oak Tree Antiques next.
Buy something big.

18:35.923 --> 18:37.290
We'll put the drill
inside the packages.

18:37.357 --> 18:40.026
No.
What do you mean, no?

18:40.093 --> 18:42.195
They'll find it. The guards
have been checking every bag.

18:42.262 --> 18:44.197
You don't understand. We have to
get into that safe today.

18:44.264 --> 18:45.631
If we can't get those tools
in there --

18:45.699 --> 18:47.400
The tools aren't gonna
do us much good

18:47.467 --> 18:49.101
if I got shot
getting them in, are they?

18:50.904 --> 18:54.006
They check the bags,
but they don't check his car.

18:55.542 --> 18:58.477
Tell Michael
we'll need a mechanic.

18:58.545 --> 18:59.946
I'll let him know
when and --

19:00.013 --> 19:03.616
A sabotage play? No. No way.
It's too risky.

19:03.684 --> 19:05.751
You two have nearly
got us killed already.

19:05.819 --> 19:07.220
We're gonna
do this my way.

19:07.287 --> 19:08.855
I don't have authorization
for this.

19:08.922 --> 19:11.424
How are we supposed to
get support teams in place?

19:11.491 --> 19:14.093
We have to take our chances
with the shopping bags right --

19:14.161 --> 19:15.261
In your dreams,
creep-o.

19:15.329 --> 19:16.829
What are you doing?
I'm saving your ass.

19:16.897 --> 19:20.066
You get out of here and you
tell Michael what I said.

19:20.133 --> 19:21.934
Vincent,
look what I found.

19:22.002 --> 19:24.737
You like? I like.
Come look.

19:33.580 --> 19:34.814
What was that?

19:34.882 --> 19:36.582
Just get in the car.

19:51.031 --> 19:52.732
Everything all right?

19:52.799 --> 19:55.968
Oh, it's my strap
of my silly shoe.

19:57.371 --> 19:58.704
Allow me.

20:07.314 --> 20:10.449
<i>The key</i>
<i>to successfully bribing someone</i>

20:10.517 --> 20:14.220
<i>who resists in initial approach</i>
<i>is research and observation.</i>

20:14.288 --> 20:16.122
<i>You need to know</i>
<i>as much as you can</i>

20:16.189 --> 20:17.523
<i>about your target --</i>

20:17.591 --> 20:19.592
<i>his principles,</i>
<i>his weaknesses, his dreams.</i>

20:19.660 --> 20:21.460
<i>With most by-the-book targets,</i>

20:21.528 --> 20:24.463
<i>it's usually just a matter</i>
<i>of making them feel like</i>

20:24.531 --> 20:26.332
<i>they're not being paid</i>
<i>to do something wrong --</i>

20:26.400 --> 20:29.302
<i>they're being rewarded</i>
<i>for doing something right.</i>

20:29.369 --> 20:31.671
Mr. Thompson,
it's good to see you again.

20:31.738 --> 20:33.539
Listen, I have to apologize
for yesterday.

20:33.607 --> 20:35.541
I screwed the pooch,

20:35.609 --> 20:37.243
and someone
told Mr. Krueger about it.

20:37.311 --> 20:39.278
He was not happy.

20:39.346 --> 20:41.180
My ears
are still ringing.

20:41.248 --> 20:42.581
So, I'm sorry.

20:42.649 --> 20:43.950
What's this?

20:44.017 --> 20:46.819
This is the good stuff.
50 years old.

20:46.887 --> 20:48.854
Mr. Krueger really
wanted me to make this right.

20:48.922 --> 20:51.324
Of course, I had to
pay for the bottle myself.

20:51.391 --> 20:53.059
The man pays you
$500,000 a year.

20:53.126 --> 20:54.393
He expects you
to clean up your own mess.

20:54.461 --> 20:56.595
Look, we're very sorry
if you were offended.

20:56.663 --> 20:57.897
And if you were,

20:57.965 --> 20:59.865
maybe a few shots of this
will help you forget it.

20:59.933 --> 21:01.867
That's fine.
Don't worry about it.

21:01.935 --> 21:03.302
Well, thanks.

21:03.370 --> 21:04.737
And, you know, actually,
Mr. Krueger was very impressed

21:04.805 --> 21:06.772
with how you handled this,
so, uh --

21:06.840 --> 21:08.074
Let's just
cut to the chase.

21:08.141 --> 21:09.475
Mr. K wants you onboard.

21:09.543 --> 21:11.744
You serious?

21:11.812 --> 21:13.713
I mean, you'd be entry level
like me --

21:13.780 --> 21:15.081
Now, wait a second.

21:15.148 --> 21:17.216
You guys really make $500,000
at entry level?

21:17.284 --> 21:19.518
Don't let that scare you off.
We promote from within.

21:19.586 --> 21:21.020
I mean,
you'd hit the big money soon.

21:24.424 --> 21:28.627
I'm sorry. I have a three-year
contract. I can't accept.

21:28.695 --> 21:30.997
Oh, well, boss's orders.
We had to try.

21:31.064 --> 21:33.399
So, I guess we should
finish up the tour.

21:33.467 --> 21:35.835
But first, how about
a taste of that scotch?

21:37.838 --> 21:39.638
Well, right this way,
gentlemen.

21:42.275 --> 21:43.943
I finally make it back.

21:44.011 --> 21:47.079
And believe it or not,
they give me a medal.

21:47.147 --> 21:48.447
Come on!
Get out of here!

21:48.515 --> 21:50.316
Never figured out it was me
who set the damn thing off

21:50.384 --> 21:51.951
in the first place.

21:52.019 --> 21:54.053
Oh, you are the man.
I love this guy.

21:54.121 --> 21:55.554
How much
do you love this guy?

21:55.622 --> 21:57.023
Krueger would, too.

21:57.090 --> 21:59.025
You know, it's a damn shame
you can't take this job.

21:59.092 --> 22:00.659
We got to
find somebody soon

22:00.727 --> 22:02.428
or we're gonna be screwed in Dubai.
That is true.

22:02.496 --> 22:06.032
You guys do a lot of work in Dubai?
Oh, please.

22:06.099 --> 22:07.833
The intercontinental there
is like my second home.

22:09.636 --> 22:11.070
If you've never had a Martini
from a six-star hotel,

22:11.138 --> 22:12.571
you should
because they're good.

22:12.639 --> 22:14.140
Oh, I bet.

22:14.207 --> 22:16.976
Would Vale send me
to Dubai? Ha!

22:17.044 --> 22:18.744
Hey, you could always go
on Krueger's dime.

22:18.812 --> 22:20.446
It's not too late.
Just saying.

22:20.514 --> 22:21.947
Not for him,
but it is for us.

22:22.015 --> 22:23.983
We're wheels up in 45.

22:24.051 --> 22:26.152
Oh, yikes.
We got to go.

22:26.219 --> 22:27.820
Hey,
it's been real, man.

22:27.888 --> 22:29.922
Thank you for everything.
Anytime.

22:31.358 --> 22:32.925
You're crazy.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.100
I don't think
he's gonna go for it.

22:41.168 --> 22:42.301
Trust me,
it's like buying a car.

22:42.369 --> 22:43.369
They won't
take you seriously

22:43.437 --> 22:44.437
till you're
walking off the lot.

22:44.504 --> 22:46.539
Hey.

22:46.606 --> 22:48.874
About that job offer,
I'd, uh...

22:48.942 --> 22:51.844
I'd love to get
a few more details.

22:57.150 --> 23:01.420
<i>Sabotage is most often used</i>
<i>to destroy a target's vehicles,</i>

23:01.488 --> 23:03.289
<i>but not always.</i>

23:03.356 --> 23:06.625
<i>Simply damaging an enemy's car</i>
<i>can be very useful, as well,</i>

23:06.693 --> 23:08.994
<i>as long as you can</i>
<i>get your own team in position</i>

23:09.062 --> 23:10.229
<i>to do the repairs.</i>

23:10.297 --> 23:12.398
It was serviced
just last week.

23:12.466 --> 23:13.866
I-I don't know
what's wrong.

23:13.934 --> 23:15.801
Well, clearly something
is wrong.

23:15.869 --> 23:19.738
Call Gregor. Tell him
to pick us up in the Bentley.

23:19.806 --> 23:22.007
Really?

23:22.075 --> 23:23.676
The Bentley all the way
from Coral Gables

23:23.743 --> 23:24.944
in this traffic?

23:25.011 --> 23:28.180
I mean, this could make it
to a service station.

23:28.248 --> 23:31.383
We could grab a little lunch
while we wait.

23:31.451 --> 23:33.819
I'm ravenous.
Aren't you ravenous?

23:36.423 --> 23:37.590
Find a place.

23:41.561 --> 23:44.997
There's a station at Coral Way
and Southwest 42nd.

23:45.065 --> 23:47.032
Good.

23:48.502 --> 23:51.203
Ladies, we're going.

23:57.244 --> 23:59.111
We got less than five minutes
before Durov gets here.

23:59.179 --> 24:00.546
All right, we'll take care
of the owner.

24:00.614 --> 24:01.814
You get set up
to plant the tools.

24:01.882 --> 24:04.483
Let's move!

24:06.119 --> 24:10.222
Hello...Al.

24:10.290 --> 24:12.892
What do you want?
What's he think he's doing?

24:12.959 --> 24:15.761
We're with the CIA. We need to
make use of your establishment.

24:15.829 --> 24:16.996
It's a matter
of national security.

24:17.063 --> 24:19.498
CIA? What's the CIA
doing in Miami?

24:19.566 --> 24:21.600
That's classified.

24:21.668 --> 24:23.469
Why do you need an auto shop
for something that's classified?

24:23.537 --> 24:25.137
Sir,
that's need-to-know.

24:25.205 --> 24:26.338
And you do not
need to know.

24:26.406 --> 24:27.606
Will you guys
get rid of him?

24:27.674 --> 24:29.742
They are coming!
I'm on this.

24:33.046 --> 24:35.831
There's no time to explain
to you right now.

24:35.832 --> 24:37.573
There won't be any damage
to your place. We just need --

24:37.598 --> 24:38.284
Oh, there'll be damage --

24:38.285 --> 24:39.318
to <i>you</i> if you don't
clear out of here.

24:39.386 --> 24:40.686
Hey, hey. Easy!

24:40.754 --> 24:42.688
Hey, now!
There's no call --

24:42.756 --> 24:45.558
for you
to tell me what to do!

24:47.327 --> 24:48.928
Closed, of course.

24:48.995 --> 24:50.129
Damn straight,
little man!

24:52.399 --> 24:53.465
It says it's open.

24:53.533 --> 24:55.000
Then where is everyone?

24:57.971 --> 24:58.971
Enough.
We don't want to hurt you.

25:06.880 --> 25:07.746
Come on!

25:08.949 --> 25:10.649
What's going on?

25:17.123 --> 25:19.058
Sorry, y'all.

25:19.125 --> 25:21.694
I was, uh -- I was cleaning up
in the back.

25:21.761 --> 25:23.596
What can I do you for?

25:33.891 --> 25:34.868
Hurry.

25:34.869 --> 25:37.404
If we don't join Vincent soon,
he's gonna come looking for us.

25:38.408 --> 25:40.748
Durov will know something's up
if you're hyperventilating.

25:40.848 --> 25:42.349
Calm down.

25:42.416 --> 25:43.617
Calm down?

25:43.684 --> 25:45.118
You almost got caught
just looking at the safe.

25:45.186 --> 25:47.087
How are you gonna have time
to drill it?

25:48.289 --> 25:50.056
Why don't you let me
deal with that, huh?

25:50.124 --> 25:51.958
For now, help me
with these tools.

25:57.531 --> 26:00.500
The drill is muffled,
but it'll still make some noise.

26:00.568 --> 26:03.670
You have to keep Durov
in the den watching the game.

26:03.738 --> 26:05.972
The louder,
the better.

26:06.040 --> 26:07.507
Timing
is gonna be tight.

26:07.575 --> 26:09.876
You just have to remember to
trigger the alarms at exactly --

26:09.944 --> 26:11.745
Quarter past.
I know.

26:11.812 --> 26:14.948
Hey. Living with Durov
was the hard part.

26:15.016 --> 26:15.949
This is easy.

26:17.251 --> 26:19.953
Michael,
we're all set.

26:20.021 --> 26:21.755
- How's the exit plan coming?
- We'll be ready.

26:21.822 --> 26:24.124
When the carbon-monoxide alarm
goes off,

26:24.191 --> 26:25.558
you'll evacuate
with the others.

26:25.626 --> 26:28.995
Do you think Angela will
be able to handle the alarms?

26:29.063 --> 26:31.298
We've been over the plan
50 times.

26:31.365 --> 26:32.165
I'll see you soon.

26:39.507 --> 26:41.641
Are you ready
to ruin Durov's day?

26:49.483 --> 26:52.118
<i>Getting people</i>
<i>to evacuate a building</i>

26:52.186 --> 26:53.987
<i>is a lot harder</i>
<i>than you might think.</i>

26:58.993 --> 27:01.861
<i>Most people don't pay</i>
<i>much attention to fire alarms</i>

27:01.929 --> 27:03.229
<i>unless they see flames.</i>

27:03.297 --> 27:05.098
<i>Carbon-monoxide alarms,</i>
<i>on the other hand,</i>

27:05.166 --> 27:08.068
<i>tend to get plenty</i>
<i>of attention.</i>

27:08.135 --> 27:10.937
<i>People are reluctant to ignore</i>
<i>a threat that's invisible,</i>

27:11.005 --> 27:12.772
<i>odorless, and deadly.</i>

27:12.840 --> 27:15.709
<i>And best of all,</i>
<i>any home with a gas line</i>

27:15.776 --> 27:18.244
<i>already has</i>
<i>a built-in delivery system.</i>

27:18.312 --> 27:19.479
Do you have any idea

27:19.547 --> 27:21.114
how many city ordinances
we had to violate

27:21.182 --> 27:22.215
for your little plan?

27:22.283 --> 27:23.683
Hooking
into the gas lines.

27:23.751 --> 27:25.552
You have a better idea of
getting them out of the house?

27:25.619 --> 27:27.187
If something explodes,
it's on you.

27:27.254 --> 27:28.455
I'm not
doing the paperwork.

27:28.522 --> 27:29.789
If something explodes,

27:29.857 --> 27:31.925
we're gonna have bigger problems
than paperwork.

27:43.637 --> 27:45.905
There we go.
Welcome aboard.

27:45.973 --> 27:47.440
I still have to
give Vale notice.

27:47.508 --> 27:49.142
But, of course,
it's just formality.

27:49.210 --> 27:50.477
You might make that plane
to Dubai after all.

27:50.544 --> 27:52.345
Oh, definitely.

27:52.413 --> 27:53.747
Now we just need to
deal with those personnel files,

27:53.814 --> 27:55.148
and we can get going.

27:55.216 --> 27:58.018
Personnel files?
What are you talking about?

27:58.085 --> 27:59.486
Come on.

27:59.553 --> 28:01.621
You can't be the only worthwhile
recruit in this outfit.

28:01.689 --> 28:03.289
We need a sniper team.

28:03.357 --> 28:05.158
You want me to poach men
from Vale?

28:05.226 --> 28:07.227
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
You said --

28:07.294 --> 28:08.862
We said
that we needed a team.

28:08.929 --> 28:10.797
I'm sorry.
I thought that was clear.

28:10.865 --> 28:12.966
Well, I'm sorry.
I thought I was clear, too.

28:13.034 --> 28:15.468
I'm not
sharing Pryon's files.

28:15.536 --> 28:17.637
I can't.
Andy, that's fine.

28:17.705 --> 28:19.305
But you can't expect Krueger
to hire you

28:19.373 --> 28:21.641
if you're refusing
your first assignment.

28:21.709 --> 28:23.376
There has to be
another way.

28:23.444 --> 28:24.677
I could
recruit my own men.

28:24.745 --> 28:26.646
I swear.
Look, I just need a --

28:26.714 --> 28:28.982
I'm very sorry,
but Krueger was specific.

28:29.050 --> 28:31.584
I can't bring you over
without those files.

28:31.652 --> 28:33.286
You'd be doing these guys
a favor, Andy.

28:33.354 --> 28:35.488
Krueger's gonna take care of them
just like he's taking care of you.

28:35.556 --> 28:37.290
Think about it.

28:38.859 --> 28:41.261
Look, I'm...

28:41.328 --> 28:42.962
I'm just gonna sit here
and work.

28:43.030 --> 28:45.331
If you happen to
wander in there,

28:45.399 --> 28:46.866
I'm too busy to notice.

28:48.702 --> 28:50.670
You read me?

28:50.738 --> 28:53.306
Loud and clear, amigo.

28:59.947 --> 29:01.481
Okay. Check it out.

29:01.549 --> 29:03.383
The Pryon Group
only has four guys

29:03.451 --> 29:04.884
qualified on the gun
that killed Nate.

29:04.952 --> 29:06.286
Two of them were in Kabul
that week.

29:06.353 --> 29:08.321
The other one was being treated
for a shoulder wound,

29:08.389 --> 29:10.990
which leaves us
with this guy.

29:11.058 --> 29:13.159
"T.G."
No name?

29:13.227 --> 29:15.795
I mean, how does Mr. Mysterious
get away with just initials?

29:15.863 --> 29:18.031
I don't know.
Hey, Thompson!

29:18.099 --> 29:19.799
Shh!
Thompson!

29:20.968 --> 29:22.168
If they hear you,
we're cooked!

29:22.236 --> 29:23.803
What's up with this T.G.?
Why no full name?

29:26.574 --> 29:28.942
He's off the books.

29:29.009 --> 29:31.444
See, sometimes Vale
lets people come down and train

29:31.512 --> 29:32.912
without
officially coming on.

29:32.980 --> 29:35.615
We don't
ask any questions.

29:35.683 --> 29:38.051
No, that guy,
you don't want to know.

29:39.186 --> 29:42.021
Okay, well,
we're just about done here,

29:42.089 --> 29:43.990
so accounting should be
in touch with you next week.

29:44.058 --> 29:46.025
Just keep your head down until
you have a start date, okay?

29:46.093 --> 29:47.160
Sure thing.

29:47.228 --> 29:48.495
Hey, we'll see you
in Dubai, huh?

29:51.232 --> 29:52.632
All right, man.

29:52.700 --> 29:54.400
Right day, right gun,

29:54.468 --> 29:56.436
pulling all the right strings
to stay off the books.

29:56.504 --> 29:57.637
T.G.'s our guy.
Yeah. Great.

29:57.705 --> 29:59.105
Now we're
two whole letters closer

29:59.173 --> 30:00.507
to finding the man
who killed Nate.

30:00.574 --> 30:03.176
Yeah, well,
closer than we were yesterday.

30:03.244 --> 30:05.311
If you say so.
Come on.

30:05.379 --> 30:06.980
I need a beer
before I start trying

30:07.047 --> 30:10.984
to pick this damn needle
out of a haystack.

30:17.558 --> 30:19.058
- You ready?
- Yeah.

30:19.126 --> 30:21.161
The alarms go off,

30:21.228 --> 30:24.397
you never have to see the CIA
or Durov again.

30:24.465 --> 30:26.199
I like the sound
of that.

30:40.080 --> 30:41.548
<i>Any safe can be cracked</i>

30:41.615 --> 30:44.083
<i>with enough time</i>
<i>and the right equipment.</i>

30:44.151 --> 30:46.553
<i>Even high-end models</i>
<i>with security features</i>

30:46.620 --> 30:48.087
<i>like glass relockers --</i>

30:48.155 --> 30:49.355
<i>sheets of glass</i>
<i>in the walls that shatter</i>

30:49.423 --> 30:51.291
<i>if you try</i>
<i>to drill through them.</i>

30:51.358 --> 30:55.762
<i>Hit one, and a locking bolt</i>
<i>seals the safe permanently.</i>

30:55.829 --> 30:58.665
<i>But if you come prepared</i>
<i>with a drill-point diagram</i>

30:58.732 --> 31:00.767
<i>and a good borescope,</i>

31:00.834 --> 31:03.503
<i>you can bypass the relocker</i>
<i>and find the combination</i>

31:03.571 --> 31:04.837
<i>by studying the wheel pack.</i>

31:04.905 --> 31:07.540
I'm going to the kitchen.
You want anything?

31:07.608 --> 31:09.309
<i>Then you just have to hope</i>

31:09.376 --> 31:11.945
<i>your plan to</i>
<i>get out of the building</i>

31:12.012 --> 31:14.314
<i>goes as well as your plan</i>
<i>to get into the safe.</i>

31:17.585 --> 31:19.252
Hey, Fi.
Did you get it?

31:19.320 --> 31:21.054
Yeah.

31:21.121 --> 31:22.422
Everything's fine.
What are you doing here?

31:22.489 --> 31:24.324
You're supposed to be

31:24.391 --> 31:25.858
setting off
the carbon-monoxide alarms.

31:25.926 --> 31:27.460
The plan was --

31:27.528 --> 31:30.363
Funny thing about the plan is...
I changed it.

31:35.035 --> 31:36.569
This is bad.

31:36.637 --> 31:38.304
That alarm
should have gone off by now.

31:38.372 --> 31:39.672
This thing
goes south on us --

31:39.740 --> 31:42.842
It's not going south.
Just give her time.

31:46.981 --> 31:48.381
Come on, Fi. Come on.

31:48.449 --> 31:51.351
It all makes sense now.

31:51.418 --> 31:53.453
Durov wasn't selling
ballistics technology. You are.

31:57.625 --> 31:58.825
Clever girl, Fi.

31:58.892 --> 32:01.494
It would have been fun
to work together for real.

32:01.562 --> 32:02.629
Oh, well. Next life.

32:04.765 --> 32:07.634
I usually work alone, but
Durov's security is too good.

32:07.701 --> 32:10.136
The CIA has all the right people
with all the right toys.

32:10.204 --> 32:12.672
Just need the magic words --
"sell to terrorists" --

32:12.740 --> 32:14.007
and those idiots
will do whatever you want.

32:15.776 --> 32:18.011
Even if you get out,
Durov will find me here.

32:18.078 --> 32:21.247
He'll figure it out.
I doubt it.

32:21.315 --> 32:25.585
See, you'll be
in little bits.

32:25.653 --> 32:26.886
It'll look like
you tried to blow the safe

32:26.954 --> 32:28.121
after you
botched the drilling.

32:31.492 --> 32:34.560
For what it's worth,

32:34.628 --> 32:37.563
you're a lot smarter
than the first guy the CIA sent.

32:37.631 --> 32:40.033
Had to kill that moron
before he got near the safe.

32:46.974 --> 32:51.978
As usual, the best man
for the job...is a woman.

33:06.829 --> 33:08.718
<i>If you need</i>
<i>to get out of a zip tie</i>

33:08.719 --> 33:09.886
<i>and you can't</i>
<i>cut yourself free,</i>

33:09.954 --> 33:13.857
<i>your best option</i>
<i>is to find a shim.</i>

33:13.925 --> 33:16.359
<i>You can make a shim</i>
<i>out of almost anything</i>

33:16.427 --> 33:18.028
<i>that's thin enough</i>
<i>and flexible enough</i>

33:18.095 --> 33:19.529
<i>to slip into the cable tie</i>
<i>and separate the teeth</i>

33:19.597 --> 33:22.532
<i>from the ratchet mechanism.</i>

33:24.669 --> 33:26.870
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>that's easier said than done</i>

33:26.938 --> 33:28.772
<i>if your hands are tied.</i>

33:47.792 --> 33:49.659
Fi.

33:49.727 --> 33:51.461
Michael, I've got a bit
of a situation.

33:51.529 --> 33:52.729
What is going on?

33:52.797 --> 33:54.965
Angela's the one
selling secrets, not Durov.

33:55.032 --> 33:56.900
She's locked me in here
with a bomb.

33:56.968 --> 33:58.201
It's got a break-wire trigger.

33:58.269 --> 33:59.869
If I try to diffuse it
or even move it, if I --

33:59.937 --> 34:01.972
if I touch one of those wires,
the whole thing explodes.

34:02.039 --> 34:03.540
I'm on my way.
No, there's no time.

34:03.607 --> 34:05.709
You need to lock this place down
before Angela escapes.

34:05.776 --> 34:08.277
Lock it down?
With you inside?

34:08.346 --> 34:09.913
No, I'm already trapped.

34:09.981 --> 34:12.047
My only shot of getting out of
here if she's in here with me.

34:12.116 --> 34:14.083
I'll take care of it.

34:14.150 --> 34:15.518
Where you going?
Where you going?

34:20.091 --> 34:21.358
Move.

34:21.425 --> 34:22.926
Not until you tell us
what the hell's going on.

34:22.994 --> 34:24.928
Sounds like your valuable asset
in there

34:24.996 --> 34:26.429
was using you
to rip off Durov.

34:26.496 --> 34:27.797
She trapped Fiona inside.

34:27.864 --> 34:29.232
Angela using us?

34:29.300 --> 34:30.667
No, I'm sorry.
That's not possible.

34:30.735 --> 34:33.636
You said yourself Durov
didn't sell to terrorists.

34:33.704 --> 34:36.106
Didn't it strike you as odd
that he changed his mind

34:36.172 --> 34:38.007
as soon as
you got someone close to him?

34:38.074 --> 34:41.244
But he killed our operative.
I saw the body.

34:41.312 --> 34:43.346
Who told you
Durov pulled the trigger?

34:43.414 --> 34:45.348
It was Angela.

34:45.416 --> 34:47.083
Oh, my God.

34:47.150 --> 34:49.252
I'm gonna say this
one more time --

34:49.320 --> 34:50.453
stay out of my way!

34:54.658 --> 34:57.927
<i>Most people know that carbon</i>
<i>monoxide is a poisonous gas.</i>

34:57.995 --> 34:59.629
<i>Inhale too much,</i>

34:59.697 --> 35:02.365
<i>and it displaces the oxygen</i>
<i>in your bloodstream</i>

35:02.433 --> 35:04.601
<i>and suffocates you</i>
<i>from the inside out.</i>

35:04.668 --> 35:07.037
Hey, Antonio.
I'm going to the liquor store.

35:07.104 --> 35:08.338
Oh, I can go.

35:08.406 --> 35:10.240
Oh, that's very sweet of you,
but I've got it.

35:10.307 --> 35:12.909
<i>What most people don't know</i>
<i>is that in a confined space</i>

35:12.977 --> 35:18.081
<i>with a vapor-to-air mixture</i>
<i>anywhere between 12% and 75%,</i>

35:18.149 --> 35:20.884
<i>it's also a powerful explosive.</i>

35:25.089 --> 35:27.657
No, no, no, no.
Let me go.

35:32.863 --> 35:36.066
We're going inside --
now!

35:41.272 --> 35:42.605
What the hell
is going on?

35:42.673 --> 35:44.107
A van hit the gate
and exploded.

35:44.175 --> 35:46.776
Sir, your office.
What about it? What's wrong?

35:46.844 --> 35:50.280
Her friend.
She broke into the safe.

35:50.347 --> 35:52.082
What are you up to?

35:52.149 --> 35:56.519
Baby...you can't believe
I knew about this.

35:59.623 --> 36:01.691
Baby, I had no idea.

36:03.928 --> 36:06.429
Come. Bring her.

36:08.933 --> 36:10.670
Do you have any idea how much
equipment you just blew up?!

36:10.695 --> 36:11.501
That is totally unacceptable!

36:11.502 --> 36:13.970
It was the fastest way
to lock it down.

36:14.038 --> 36:15.572
Yeah!
With Angela inside!

36:15.639 --> 36:17.740
With -- with the information
we came for!

36:17.808 --> 36:19.309
We have to got
to get in there.

36:19.376 --> 36:21.544
Yeah, we do! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

36:21.612 --> 36:22.645
Dude!

36:22.713 --> 36:24.280
You go in now,
Fiona dies.

36:24.348 --> 36:26.216
What are you doing?
You had your chance.

36:26.283 --> 36:27.851
Now we're gonna
do it her way.

36:29.019 --> 36:30.687
Durov,
there's a bomb in your safe.

36:30.754 --> 36:31.888
Angela is the only one
who can disarm it.

36:31.956 --> 36:33.223
What are you talking about?!

36:33.290 --> 36:34.524
We have
less than two minutes.

36:34.592 --> 36:36.659
I'm with the CIA.
There's no time to explain.

36:36.727 --> 36:38.061
Why would you say such a thing?
Baby, she's lying!

36:38.129 --> 36:40.130
Do you think I know
how to build a bomb?

36:41.765 --> 36:42.932
You know what I think?

36:44.535 --> 36:48.138
I think it is your bomb.
Now disarm it.

36:53.777 --> 36:55.111
Fine.

36:55.179 --> 36:58.615
Pull out the circuit board
and cut the yellow wires.

37:02.653 --> 37:04.254
Do it.

37:15.599 --> 37:16.499
No, stop!

37:33.817 --> 37:37.153
It was your bomb.
You lying bitch!

37:37.221 --> 37:40.290
Durov,
put the gun down.

37:40.357 --> 37:42.926
I was sent here
to stop the sale

37:42.993 --> 37:44.827
of ballistics technology
to terrorists.

37:44.895 --> 37:47.230
The CIA think you're behind it.
I know you're not.

37:47.298 --> 37:49.866
But if you kill her,
I'll have no way of proving it.

37:49.934 --> 37:54.037
It's your call,
Vincent.

37:54.104 --> 37:55.538
You die in prison
or she does.

37:59.176 --> 38:00.210
Get them out of my sight.

38:13.891 --> 38:15.692
Wow.
Job well done, you two.

38:15.759 --> 38:18.228
I mean, uh, we could have done
with fewer explosions,

38:18.295 --> 38:19.896
but bravo.

38:19.964 --> 38:20.997
Nice work.

38:21.065 --> 38:22.131
What do you want?

38:22.199 --> 38:23.533
Right.

38:23.601 --> 38:26.102
Um, we were thinking
that in the official report,

38:26.170 --> 38:29.405
it might help if Angela
were the original target.

38:29.473 --> 38:31.507
Don't want to
confuse anyone.

38:31.575 --> 38:33.076
You know
how the brass can be.

38:33.143 --> 38:34.277
So Fiona
saves your ass

38:34.345 --> 38:36.346
and now you want her
to cover this up, too.

38:36.413 --> 38:37.780
Oh, no.

38:37.848 --> 38:39.649
"Cover up" is --
no, no, no. Just --

38:39.717 --> 38:41.484
it would just be
like a detail --

38:41.552 --> 38:43.553
simplifying.
How about this?

38:43.621 --> 38:46.189
You write your report.
You write whatever you want.

38:46.257 --> 38:50.326
But the agreement that I signed
with the CIA -- lose it.

38:50.394 --> 38:51.928
For good.

38:51.996 --> 38:53.963
That's --
that sounds doable.

38:54.031 --> 38:55.698
Then do it.

38:55.766 --> 38:58.368
Good.
Nice job, you guys.

39:05.566 --> 39:06.711
Seriously?

39:06.712 --> 39:09.747
That's all Pryon had on the man
who killed my brother?

39:10.350 --> 39:11.936
Initials
and weapons clearances?

39:12.028 --> 39:13.462
Mike,
the guy is a ghost.

39:13.529 --> 39:15.564
Jesse and I found zip,

39:15.631 --> 39:17.899
and we looked under every rock
we could think of.

39:17.967 --> 39:19.901
Then we go back to Vale.

39:19.969 --> 39:21.760
Well, that's what I'm thinking.
But the question is,

39:21.761 --> 39:24.195
how do we explain the fact
we know this guy exists?

39:24.263 --> 39:25.630
We don't.

39:25.698 --> 39:27.265
Vale said he could build a team
that fit my needs.

39:27.333 --> 39:29.901
I'll make sure all my needs
add up to T.G.

39:29.969 --> 39:31.236
Well,
that could work,

39:31.303 --> 39:33.405
but we could also get a list
of 10 other guys

39:33.472 --> 39:34.873
who had nothing to do
with this,

39:34.940 --> 39:37.475
or Vale sees through it
and we both get killed.

39:37.543 --> 39:39.511
I don't see any other way.
Do you?

39:41.213 --> 39:43.048
Make the call.

39:45.718 --> 39:47.986
Mr. Vale's office,
please.

39:48.054 --> 39:50.221
I have Mr. Krueger
for him.

39:50.289 --> 39:52.824
Hold, please.

39:55.194 --> 39:58.463
Vale.
My men were very impressed.

39:58.531 --> 40:00.765
I want to
send you some specs,

40:00.833 --> 40:02.467
get you started
on building my team.

40:02.535 --> 40:04.369
Excellent.

40:11.577 --> 40:14.412
So, Mike, assuming we get Vale
to set up a meeting

40:14.480 --> 40:15.680
with this son of a bitch,

40:15.748 --> 40:17.816
we got to come up with a plan
to snatch him.

40:17.883 --> 40:19.350
You're thinking
interrogation?

40:19.418 --> 40:20.652
Yeah, something like that.
We're only gonna get one --

40:20.720 --> 40:22.454
he's here.

40:22.521 --> 40:23.722
Hey. You made it.

40:23.789 --> 40:25.290
We were gonna
give you a call.

40:25.357 --> 40:26.558
I won't be staying long.

40:26.625 --> 40:28.226
Why? What's wrong?

40:28.294 --> 40:29.461
What the hell
are you up to?

40:29.528 --> 40:30.628
What are you
talking about?

40:30.696 --> 40:31.896
Don't play games with me.

40:31.964 --> 40:33.631
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

40:33.699 --> 40:35.233
Uh, no.
Uh, really, we don't.

40:35.301 --> 40:36.568
Oh, sure.

40:36.635 --> 40:39.204
He asked for a sniper
cleared on five different guns

40:39.271 --> 40:42.307
who's got experience
in Costa Rica and speaks Farsi.

40:42.374 --> 40:43.641
Did you think
I wouldn't figure out

40:43.709 --> 40:45.290
you're looking
for Tyler Gray?

40:45.644 --> 40:47.512
Tyler Gray?

40:47.580 --> 40:48.646
Are you kidding me?

40:48.714 --> 40:50.315
The only reason I'm here

40:50.382 --> 40:52.517
is because I'm <i>not</i> gonna
talk about it on the phone.

40:52.585 --> 40:56.721
Now, I don't know who you are,
but this is over.

40:56.789 --> 40:59.090
You need to back off.

40:59.158 --> 41:00.992
And so does that guy
you got following me.

41:01.060 --> 41:02.494
What? There's someone
following you?

41:02.561 --> 41:06.030
Are you sure?
Yeah. I'm sure.

41:06.098 --> 41:08.700
Listen, Vale, calm down.
I'm not having you followed.

41:08.768 --> 41:10.068
Why did you --

41:20.880 --> 41:22.180
Dad, look!
Someone shot that guy.

41:22.248 --> 41:23.815
Kid, stay down.

41:25.718 --> 41:28.019
Vale! Vale!

41:28.087 --> 41:29.654
Stay with me.
Who's Tyler Gray?

41:29.722 --> 41:31.656
Who's Tyler Gray?!

41:31.724 --> 41:33.324
Who's Tyler Gray?!

41:33.392 --> 41:36.294
Mike, he's gone.
