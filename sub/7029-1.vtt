00:12.490 --> 00:18.160
it is another year on Oak Island one
that marks a significant milestone for

00:18.160 --> 00:20.820
brothers Rick and Marty lagina and

00:20.820 --> 00:25.009
members of their team because after 50

00:25.009 --> 00:27.849
years of dreaming there we are and a

00:27.849 --> 00:31.289
decade of researching

00:31.289 --> 00:34.660
and processing information it is now

00:34.660 --> 00:37.730
finally the time to dig that's a nice

00:37.730 --> 00:40.140
machine right there

00:40.140 --> 00:45.540
but where and how deep aren't just two

00:45.540 --> 00:47.850
of the questions they will be facing

00:47.850 --> 00:49.630
let's try give one little pull there and

00:49.630 --> 00:51.659
the way you go

00:51.659 --> 00:56.140
because hundreds of others have come

00:56.140 --> 00:58.199
before them and all have failed or died

00:58.199 --> 01:00.850
trying there's been generation after

01:00.850 --> 01:03.230
generation involved in this search and

01:03.230 --> 01:05.489
now it's come to us

01:05.489 --> 01:09.119
looking at all that equipment I have to

01:09.119 --> 01:10.990
admit it's exciting to think you're

01:10.990 --> 01:13.299
digging on Oak Island how can it not be

01:13.299 --> 01:15.650
exciting if you can't get excited leave

01:15.650 --> 01:19.899
you're hoping you're anticipating I can

01:19.899 --> 01:21.840
dig for right here I'm saying I'm ready

01:21.840 --> 01:23.719
to go and then as that first show

01:23.719 --> 01:27.520
hopeful proceeds you want there to be

01:27.520 --> 01:35.869
something when that bucket tips

01:35.869 --> 01:39.240
there is an island in the North Atlantic

01:39.240 --> 01:41.290
where people have been looking for an

01:41.290 --> 01:44.950
incredible treasure for more than 200

01:44.950 --> 01:47.780
years so far they have found bits of

01:47.780 --> 01:51.359
gold chain a stone slab with strange

01:51.359 --> 01:54.820
symbols carved into it even a 17th

01:54.820 --> 01:58.899
century Spanish coin today six men have

01:58.899 --> 02:02.939
died trying to solve the mystery and

02:02.939 --> 02:06.679
according to legend one more will have

02:06.679 --> 02:31.930
to die before the treasure can be found

02:31.930 --> 02:39.740
[Music]

02:39.740 --> 02:48.700
okay Big Brother well we're coming into

02:48.700 --> 02:51.960
western shore and true to form we have

02:51.960 --> 02:54.380
nasty nasty weather focus on the

02:54.380 --> 02:56.630
positive positive is we're back we're

02:56.630 --> 02:58.320
back we're back

02:58.320 --> 03:02.501
it's an interesting year it's 50 years

03:02.501 --> 03:05.570
since we've read the article is it 50

03:05.570 --> 03:09.430
years ago fears hard to believe it was

03:09.430 --> 03:14.100
50 years ago in 1965 that an article

03:14.100 --> 03:16.230
detailing the legend of the Oak Island

03:16.230 --> 03:19.300
money pit appeared in the January issue

03:19.300 --> 03:22.650
of Reader's Digest it was this simple

03:22.650 --> 03:25.070
five-page article that inflamed the

03:25.070 --> 03:27.950
imagination of an 11 year old boy named

03:27.950 --> 03:30.750
Rick lagina who along with his younger

03:30.750 --> 03:33.230
brother marty was growing up in

03:33.230 --> 03:36.430
Michigan's Upper Peninsula it was also

03:36.430 --> 03:38.460
this same article that caught the

03:38.460 --> 03:41.050
attention of a florida-based contractor

03:41.050 --> 03:44.710
named dan Blankenship Blankenship soon

03:44.710 --> 03:46.790
after moved to Oak Island with his wife

03:46.790 --> 03:49.490
and has spent the past 50 years of his

03:49.490 --> 03:52.320
life obsessed with finding a treasure

03:52.320 --> 03:58.630
here this is a special year look you

03:58.630 --> 04:01.110
know we're at the brink we've just got

04:01.110 --> 04:03.650
the most important data know that Oak

04:03.650 --> 04:07.210
Island is seen in 50 years yeah

04:07.210 --> 04:09.260
and that's what's cool

04:09.260 --> 04:11.850
last year Rick and Marty trying to send

04:11.850 --> 04:15.470
two divers down to the bottom of the

04:15.470 --> 04:18.410
235-foot treasure shaft known as 10x

04:18.410 --> 04:27.680
only to hit a dead end
using scanning

04:27.680 --> 04:30.949
sonar they mapped an underground cavern

04:30.949 --> 04:33.199
that dan Blankenship first discovered

04:33.199 --> 04:36.180
when he dug 10x more than 40 years ago

04:36.180 --> 04:41.020
this is by the lift damn hole they even

04:41.020 --> 04:43.910
gathered data that suggested that Dan's

04:43.910 --> 04:48.729
claims of scene of vertical post

04:48.729 --> 04:52.719
man-made tools and wooden chests might

04:52.719 --> 04:53.719
very well be true

04:53.719 --> 05:05.220
we're almost Eric here's the Cosway

05:05.220 --> 05:07.789
the overriding theme this year is to

05:07.789 --> 05:10.960
cross a few of the more substantive

05:10.960 --> 05:12.560
possibilities off the list

05:12.560 --> 05:16.881
the swamp the money pit 10-x it's time

05:16.881 --> 05:17.881
for us to get some answers let's get to

05:17.881 --> 05:24.499
the bottom of 10-x once and for all

05:24.499 --> 05:27.580
to get to the bottom of 10-x Marty and

05:27.580 --> 05:30.220
Rick have decided on a bold and

05:30.220 --> 05:33.509
potentially dangerous plan they will

05:33.509 --> 05:37.879
send a diver down 181 feet and then

05:37.879 --> 05:41.560
another 44 feet through a narrow 27-inch

05:41.560 --> 05:44.569
hole to what their research has revealed

05:44.569 --> 05:47.389
could be a large underground treasure

05:47.389 --> 05:50.830
chamber but first they will have to

05:50.830 --> 05:53.370
clear decades of rusted pipes including

05:53.370 --> 05:57.840
a badly corroded 10-foot riser pipe the

05:57.840 --> 06:00.139
pipe was originally put there in order

06:00.139 --> 06:02.529
to pump water and hopefully precious

06:02.529 --> 06:06.919
artifacts out of the shaft but now it is

06:06.919 --> 06:09.279
a dangerous obstruction to anyone

06:09.279 --> 06:14.820
attempting to dive

06:14.820 --> 06:16.969
to remove the riser pipe the brothers

06:16.969 --> 06:19.660
will need to descend more than 40 feet

06:19.660 --> 06:21.949
down the possibly unstable

06:21.949 --> 06:26.539
eight-foot-wide portion of the hole OD I

06:26.539 --> 06:29.659
was going you're gonna take care of us

06:29.659 --> 06:36.409
right here in good hands that's what I

06:36.409 --> 06:37.409
wanted to hear right there

06:37.409 --> 06:43.979
we get a little trepidation Parminder

06:43.979 --> 06:47.729
I'm in a suit or a harness and I'm a

06:47.729 --> 06:49.139
human being going down there you know

06:49.139 --> 06:52.469
it's a death trap in there of pipes and

06:52.469 --> 06:55.599
ropes and ladders and rusty stuff

06:55.599 --> 06:58.270
there's a certain degree of danger to

06:58.270 --> 07:00.960
those things here's the deal

07:00.960 --> 07:02.930
you watch him one point of contact one

07:02.930 --> 07:05.020
point of direction whatever he tells you

07:05.020 --> 07:07.620
to do do and that's as simple as that

07:07.620 --> 07:13.460
okay let's go for right my brother and I

07:13.460 --> 07:15.219
started this together and it's nice when

07:15.219 --> 07:18.189
we do things on site together and he

07:18.189 --> 07:25.370
wanted to go down and I was grateful

07:25.370 --> 07:28.150
for Marty this is his first experience

07:28.150 --> 07:32.550
inside the 235 foot deep borehole gone

07:32.550 --> 07:33.550
down

07:33.550 --> 07:38.499
Terrax here we come although the first

07:38.499 --> 07:42.360
181 feet was reinforced with both steel

07:42.360 --> 07:44.949
and concrete to keep it from collapsing

07:44.949 --> 07:46.319
under the enormous pressure

07:46.319 --> 07:49.210
this is Oregon's after 40 years of harsh

07:49.210 --> 07:52.719
weather and churning saltwater tides the

07:52.719 --> 07:55.529
metal casing has become rusted and could

07:55.529 --> 08:02.059
very well be unstable when this cord

08:02.059 --> 08:07.169
10 feet we get down in the shaft and we

08:07.169 --> 08:08.729
each had a different interpretation he

08:08.729 --> 08:11.219
looked at it kind of like a science guy

08:11.219 --> 08:15.800
studying the engineering of it what is

08:15.800 --> 08:18.809
that and I was being a little bit of a

08:18.809 --> 08:21.270
dreamer thinking my gosh they built it

08:21.270 --> 08:23.979
on faith believing there was something

08:23.979 --> 08:25.680
down below going down

08:25.680 --> 08:33.360
you keep an eye on the riser you know

08:33.360 --> 08:35.929
what a setup

08:35.929 --> 08:42.159
oh why wouldn't I get it this thing like

08:42.159 --> 08:46.200
going it we're strapped to it

08:46.200 --> 08:49.300
and kill us to be good on in drone

08:49.300 --> 08:51.899
before cutting the rusted pipe Rick and

08:51.899 --> 08:53.920
Marty must first secure it with Rome

08:53.920 --> 08:56.110
that has been tied to the platform by

08:56.110 --> 08:58.850
dave blankenship at the surface this

08:58.850 --> 09:01.220
will ensure that the column of corroded

09:01.220 --> 09:03.920
steel doesn't fall down the shaft and

09:03.920 --> 09:06.680
create an even bigger obstacle later on

09:06.680 --> 09:10.380
what are we gonna get on to get down

09:10.380 --> 09:12.760
there in that gap give it how are we

09:12.760 --> 09:20.899
gonna get done Rick's leaning over the

09:20.899 --> 09:23.269
basket and ever since we've been kids

09:23.269 --> 09:25.980
he's always been more of a risk-taker

09:25.980 --> 09:30.139
than I am truth is I didn't even think

09:30.139 --> 09:33.160
about there you go

09:33.160 --> 09:34.320
what are you planning on doing outside

09:34.320 --> 09:35.320
that bucket

09:35.320 --> 09:44.480
Bobby isn't the safest thing don't do it

09:44.480 --> 09:47.010
the back of the pockets on

09:47.010 --> 10:04.070
alright are you alright Rick lagina has

10:04.070 --> 10:06.519
just had a close call while working

10:06.519 --> 10:10.570
inside borehole 10-x my hardest

10:10.570 --> 10:15.170
got me the ankle removing the corroded

10:15.170 --> 10:17.750
riser pipe is more difficult and

10:17.750 --> 10:20.100
dangerous than either Rick or Marty

10:20.100 --> 10:23.190
expected even though it is 8 feet wide

10:23.190 --> 10:26.730
the 10x shaft is cramped and the

10:26.730 --> 10:28.569
possibility that the rusted metal casing

10:28.569 --> 10:31.630
could collapse is very real sure all

10:31.630 --> 10:34.949
right get back in there with the old

10:34.949 --> 10:37.460
rusted drill pipe securely tied to the

10:37.460 --> 10:40.610
platform Rick and Marty will cut off a

10:40.610 --> 10:43.570
large section obstructing the shaft this

10:43.570 --> 10:45.980
should allow future divers to be able to

10:45.980 --> 10:49.769
maneuver safely during their narrow

10:49.769 --> 11:04.250
235-foot descent down 10x

11:04.250 --> 11:05.589
even though we had it secured by the

11:05.589 --> 11:07.720
rope I was concerned because that pipe

11:07.720 --> 11:10.050
was so rusty and junky that when we cut

11:10.050 --> 11:15.840
it they could completely fall apart

11:15.840 --> 11:27.060
those ready to come out now

11:27.060 --> 11:39.259
success really

11:39.259 --> 11:41.149
now that the potential obstruction has

11:41.149 --> 11:43.720
been caught the team has the difficult

11:43.720 --> 11:46.949
task of figuring out how to safely hoist

11:46.949 --> 11:49.420
hundreds of pounds of rusted steel out

11:49.420 --> 11:50.430
of 10x

11:50.430 --> 11:54.819
are you gonna hook on dude hook it right

11:54.819 --> 11:58.819
here if we can hold it but we're going

11:58.819 --> 12:02.310
to pull this rally-ho

12:02.310 --> 12:08.511
now we can help Gus into here but yeah

12:08.511 --> 12:09.649
but then you're gonna use them full of

12:09.649 --> 12:13.240
railing off that I'm gonna do here is

12:13.240 --> 12:15.310
the problem when we tied off at the

12:15.310 --> 12:17.500
surface we realized that we had to get

12:17.500 --> 12:19.290
the rope off in order to lift the pipe

12:19.290 --> 12:21.339
up and to do that we had to get slack in

12:21.339 --> 12:23.350
it

12:23.350 --> 12:26.930
I can pull it up you can yeah yeah I can

12:26.930 --> 12:29.600
pull it up you got a robber Rick if you

12:29.600 --> 12:32.190
have to do in there to do it yeah I got

12:32.190 --> 12:36.880
I'll have some here soon ropeburn

12:36.880 --> 12:39.550
you know what if you fall in there

12:39.550 --> 12:41.490
you're gonna die don't little quit

12:41.490 --> 12:45.699
everything we do think I would do

12:45.699 --> 12:48.129
something together this blood wait a sec

12:48.129 --> 12:49.709
why don't you sit over there

12:49.709 --> 13:04.139
let's do this

13:04.139 --> 13:07.290
was it heavy yeah it was happy but I

13:07.290 --> 13:10.550
just had enough to get then the slack so

13:10.550 --> 13:11.850
they could hook on to the crane

13:11.850 --> 13:12.850
Oh

13:12.850 --> 13:22.630
after a
day of hard work and a few close

13:22.630 --> 13:25.300
calls the Oak Island team has finally

13:25.300 --> 13:27.170
managed to remove one of the

13:27.170 --> 13:31.490
deteriorating riser pipes from 10x

13:31.490 --> 13:38.079
lovely but the pipe is just the first of

13:38.079 --> 13:40.250
many that will have to be extracted

13:40.250 --> 13:42.770
before Rick and Marty will declare the

13:42.770 --> 13:46.579
235-foot deep borehole save enough for

13:46.579 --> 13:50.459
another attempted dive hey big brother

13:50.459 --> 13:53.199
one small victory one very tiny victory

13:53.199 --> 13:58.870
but we won good way to end the day

13:58.870 --> 13:59.870
anyway

13:59.870 --> 14:04.750
it is morning on Oak Island a time when

14:04.750 --> 14:07.939
results are processed questions are

14:07.939 --> 14:11.779
raised and new information is considered

14:11.779 --> 14:16.899
okay today Rick Marty and their partners

14:16.899 --> 14:19.120
have agreed to meet with father-son

14:19.120 --> 14:21.790
treasure hunters Robert and Bob Leonard

14:21.790 --> 14:23.529
and they're gonna give a presentation

14:23.529 --> 14:26.839
today the pair have traveled all the way

14:26.839 --> 14:29.460
from Texas to present an amazing theory

14:29.460 --> 14:31.790
about Oak Island and what they are

14:31.790 --> 14:35.350
convinced is not one treasure site but

14:35.350 --> 14:38.110
several guys take it away guys

14:38.110 --> 14:40.750
our company utilizes a technology that

14:40.750 --> 14:44.380
is based on satellite imagery that reads

14:44.380 --> 14:46.840
a certain wavelengths of light and based

14:46.840 --> 14:50.380
on that it technology will identify it

14:50.380 --> 14:51.889
almost any kind of thing you're looking

14:51.889 --> 14:52.889
for

14:52.889 --> 14:55.480
it's called nuclear magnetic resonance

14:55.480 --> 14:56.480
imaging

14:56.480 --> 15:00.230
and it can go in and analyze and see

15:00.230 --> 15:01.700
things that we can't see with the human

15:01.700 --> 15:04.800
eye similar to the type of technology

15:04.800 --> 15:06.600
that is used in medical facilities

15:06.600 --> 15:09.769
during an MRI no clear magnetic

15:09.769 --> 15:12.720
resonance can detect subtle differences

15:12.720 --> 15:14.139
in what are called the resonance

15:14.139 --> 15:16.370
frequencies emitted by various

15:16.370 --> 15:18.459
substances when subjected to

15:18.459 --> 15:21.769
electromagnetic radiation according to

15:21.769 --> 15:24.329
the Leonard's this technology when

15:24.329 --> 15:27.310
coupled with detailed satellite imagery

15:27.310 --> 15:28.500
is similar to the type of

15:28.500 --> 15:31.220
ground-penetrating technology currently

15:31.220 --> 15:34.259
being used by the US military to locate

15:34.259 --> 15:36.500
underground weapon systems and secret

15:36.500 --> 15:39.440
bunkers it can produce a map that

15:39.440 --> 15:41.769
enables them to virtually see beneath

15:41.769 --> 15:44.319
the surface of the earth and precisely

15:44.319 --> 15:47.480
identify objects at various depths all

15:47.480 --> 15:48.600
right so here's the map

15:48.600 --> 15:55.389
your lines are supposed to represent

15:55.389 --> 16:01.040
what tunnels yeah these are tunnels once

16:01.040 --> 16:03.160
the green mean that means it's flooded

16:03.160 --> 16:04.970
with seawater what's the blue me

16:04.970 --> 16:09.639
blue is loaded not flooded got tunnels

16:09.639 --> 16:14.180
we've got old wood so we don't care

16:14.180 --> 16:17.389
about the old wooden that's right that's

16:17.389 --> 16:19.740
right

16:19.740 --> 16:24.230
we've got bronze

16:24.230 --> 16:30.310
we've got silver we've got gold

16:30.310 --> 16:41.089
we've got rubies ivory diamonds and one

16:41.089 --> 16:42.449
part of me says this is completely

16:42.449 --> 16:48.899
impossible on the other hand right

16:48.899 --> 16:57.089
absolutely do this here having some up

16:57.089 --> 17:00.220
with the evidence of treasure in the

17:00.220 --> 17:04.180
ground yes Rick Marty and their partners

17:04.180 --> 17:06.640
have just heard what is perhaps the most

17:06.640 --> 17:09.640
incredible theory in the 220 year old

17:09.640 --> 17:12.240
history of Oak Island you're saying that

17:12.240 --> 17:15.659
you can find objects with info we can

17:15.659 --> 17:17.839
through the magnetic resonance imaging

17:17.839 --> 17:20.609
using a highly experimental and largely

17:20.609 --> 17:23.109
top-secret method father and son

17:23.109 --> 17:26.059
treasure hunters Robert and Bob Leonard

17:26.059 --> 17:28.990
have just presented data suggesting that

17:28.990 --> 17:31.620
a web of underground tunnels each

17:31.620 --> 17:34.410
leading to vast deposits of jewels and

17:34.410 --> 17:37.240
precious metals lies beneath the surface

17:37.240 --> 17:40.850
of the 140 acre island

17:40.850 --> 17:43.940
look I have a high degree of skepticism

17:43.940 --> 17:47.430
okay to some extent you're presenting a

17:47.430 --> 17:50.140
black box technology is no doubt about

17:50.140 --> 17:52.260
it it's hard to explain you are Tartars

17:52.260 --> 17:53.990
we are in the oil business I don't know

17:53.990 --> 17:55.630
how many times so I'm going to show it

17:55.630 --> 17:57.350
up in our office with what we call black

17:57.350 --> 17:59.390
box technology and by that we mean we

17:59.390 --> 18:01.690
don't know what's inside the box we're

18:01.690 --> 18:04.350
not saying that just because you can't

18:04.350 --> 18:05.530
see in there doesn't mean it doesn't

18:05.530 --> 18:07.620
work I mean we want to try everything

18:07.620 --> 18:10.140
you know that has a potential of working

18:10.140 --> 18:12.870
out here you know what strikes me here

18:12.870 --> 18:15.289
is Dan you have long believed how

18:15.289 --> 18:17.742
extensive the tunneling complex hell of

18:17.742 --> 18:22.150
a lot more than that if anyone has heard

18:22.150 --> 18:24.390
every Theory there is concerning Oak

18:24.390 --> 18:28.330
Island it's dan Blankenship in 50 years

18:28.330 --> 18:30.730
he's seen and done more than just about

18:30.730 --> 18:34.180
anyone to try and solve the mystery if

18:34.180 --> 18:36.850
anything the Leonard's incredible theory

18:36.850 --> 18:40.100
only confirms what Dan has long believed

18:40.100 --> 18:42.510
that Oak Island lies atop of virtual

18:42.510 --> 18:45.450
maze of treasure tunnels you have

18:45.450 --> 18:47.790
punched many holes you know trying to

18:47.790 --> 18:49.830
find tunnels cut in over a hundred holes

18:49.830 --> 18:52.230
did you find tunnels or voids under the

18:52.230 --> 18:53.350
ground of course

18:53.350 --> 18:56.190
that's good using an ancient method

18:56.190 --> 18:59.220
known as dowsing where by divining rods

18:59.220 --> 19:01.320
can indicate voids in the ground which

19:01.320 --> 19:04.520
could in turn contain water or even oil

19:04.520 --> 19:07.520
dan has come to believe that various

19:07.520 --> 19:10.240
tunnels exist in multiple locations on

19:10.240 --> 19:13.140
the island it was by dowsing

19:13.140 --> 19:15.659
that Dan was able to find the cavern at

19:15.659 --> 19:20.260
the bottom of 10x some 235 feet under

19:20.260 --> 19:23.990
I mean I find it curious that when the

19:23.990 --> 19:26.400
when they Leonard showed us their map

19:26.400 --> 19:28.279
there were areas that were consistent

19:28.279 --> 19:31.169
with Dan's dowsing this is kind of the

19:31.169 --> 19:36.679
biggest void here it's about 150 160 170

19:36.679 --> 19:39.500
five feet long and about 60 feet wide so

19:39.500 --> 19:40.500
we figured that'd be a pretty easy

19:40.500 --> 19:41.860
target and there is a gold signature in

19:41.860 --> 19:43.590
there and what we're gonna do is try to

19:43.590 --> 19:45.620
prove it a couple of ways we brought

19:45.620 --> 19:47.169
another metal detector and we've also

19:47.169 --> 19:50.360
brought a resistivity machine and if

19:50.360 --> 19:52.010
these two technologies will say that

19:52.010 --> 19:54.350
paints the same picture and then we

19:54.350 --> 19:56.870
would go from there I mean I'm sure

19:56.870 --> 19:58.200
everybody on this side of the table

19:58.200 --> 20:01.310
wants to believe it well they've what do

20:01.310 --> 20:06.330
you think but do you believe in in that

20:06.330 --> 20:11.390
type of tunnel layout I'm hoping Rick

20:11.390 --> 20:19.140
not the question skeptical minutes out

20:19.140 --> 20:22.850
there but prove it my guess is you guys

20:22.850 --> 20:25.250
are raring to go yes why don't we get

20:25.250 --> 20:27.429
them going Jack yeah I'd love to go with

20:27.429 --> 20:29.193
them and check it out and why don't you

20:29.193 --> 20:30.850
get Charles too because he can direct

20:30.850 --> 20:34.059
you we're on the island better go get us

20:34.059 --> 20:39.940
some data while Rick and Marty returned

20:39.940 --> 20:43.559
to their work on 10x Craig stepson Jack

20:43.559 --> 20:46.149
Begley and Island historian Charles

20:46.149 --> 20:48.830
Barkhouse have joined father and son

20:48.830 --> 20:51.690
treasure hunters Bob and Robert Leonard

20:51.690 --> 20:54.090
at the center of the island near the

20:54.090 --> 20:58.000
mysterious triangle-shaped swamp

20:58.000 --> 21:00.020
the Leonard's are planning to run field

21:00.020 --> 21:02.779
tests in order to determine if their

21:02.779 --> 21:05.279
theory that a vast network of treasure

21:05.279 --> 21:09.320
tunnels exists under Oak Island is true

21:09.320 --> 21:11.110
most exciting target is right up the

21:11.110 --> 21:13.230
road over there that's showing a gold in

21:13.230 --> 21:16.149
there a hundred eight feet deep

21:16.149 --> 21:18.490
using their satellite map of the island

21:18.490 --> 21:20.890
the Leonard's have chosen to focus on a

21:20.890 --> 21:23.730
large target with gold signatures

21:23.730 --> 21:25.860
located northwest of the Oak Island

21:25.860 --> 21:29.410
swamp how does this resistivity work

21:29.410 --> 21:30.880
basically we're gonna send electricity

21:30.880 --> 21:32.390
through the ground and if it doesn't

21:32.390 --> 21:36.549
connect then it's hitting a FOID

21:36.549 --> 21:39.029
resistivity works by sending electrical

21:39.029 --> 21:41.450
currents into the ground between two

21:41.450 --> 21:45.240
points or pros as the currents blow they

21:45.240 --> 21:47.280
aren't down into the earth twice the

21:47.280 --> 21:50.350
distance between the probe stems any

21:50.350 --> 21:52.990
breaks in the current or resistivity

21:52.990 --> 21:56.049
would indicate a void or in this case a

21:56.049 --> 21:57.980
tunnel

21:57.980 --> 21:59.520
the resistivity portion of their

21:59.520 --> 22:02.460
investigation is proven technology you

22:02.460 --> 22:05.220
can use resistivity to determine certain

22:05.220 --> 22:09.169
things in the ground using a GPS system

22:09.169 --> 22:10.980
to locate the tunnel coordinates from

22:10.980 --> 22:13.909
the map the Leonard's mark two points

22:13.909 --> 22:17.730
with two electric probes one positive

22:17.730 --> 22:19.289
and one negative right

22:19.289 --> 22:20.700
yeah

22:20.700 --> 22:27.460
all right let's go plug it in okay so

22:27.460 --> 22:29.800
turn on

22:29.800 --> 22:30.800
so we'll be able to see on this little

22:30.800 --> 22:36.080
display here will do a manual scan so

22:36.080 --> 22:40.200
let's see what it says all right that

22:40.200 --> 22:42.539
says ground

22:42.539 --> 22:45.549
which means we're heating all earth so

22:45.549 --> 22:46.590
no tunnel

22:46.590 --> 22:48.929
let's look that's good that pins right

22:48.929 --> 22:51.071
there so we missed it so what we need to

22:51.071 --> 22:52.820
do is move it over about ten feet so

22:52.820 --> 22:54.659
let's run over there and we're gonna

22:54.659 --> 22:56.690
move that state cover so far

22:56.690 --> 22:59.210
the electrical resistivity machine has

22:59.210 --> 23:01.670
revealed no evidence of the underground

23:01.670 --> 23:03.470
tunnels that were indicated by the

23:03.470 --> 23:06.370
satellite data could it mean another

23:06.370 --> 23:10.090
dead end let's go try it and if we don't

23:10.090 --> 23:12.740
get something on this line well I'm just

23:12.740 --> 23:16.799
gonna pack my stuff up and go home I

23:16.799 --> 23:25.230
guess let's kick it back on see what it

23:25.230 --> 23:27.020
says

23:27.020 --> 23:28.809
[Music]

23:28.809 --> 23:30.590
Cave says it right there does it make

23:30.590 --> 23:32.049
any sense at all that there would be a

23:32.049 --> 23:35.950
tunnel over here Courtney what dance

23:35.950 --> 23:39.409
belief is absolute belief that there are

23:39.409 --> 23:40.590
tunnels small through this island that

23:40.590 --> 23:41.861
if you can get down there and find it it

23:41.861 --> 23:43.380
just confers what he's been saying for

23:43.380 --> 23:46.020
50 years yeah so let's pack this up okay

23:46.020 --> 23:57.540
yep

23:57.540 --> 23:59.980
father and son treasure hunters Robert

23:59.980 --> 24:02.700
and Bob Leonard are convinced they have

24:02.700 --> 24:05.279
located a subterranean tunnel filled

24:05.279 --> 24:07.760
with gold near the middle of the island

24:07.760 --> 24:09.210
come out here I'll show you where the

24:09.210 --> 24:11.590
gold spot is perhaps even more

24:11.590 --> 24:14.570
significant it is located just where

24:14.570 --> 24:16.610
their earlier research told them it

24:16.610 --> 24:19.110
should be nearly half a mile from the

24:19.110 --> 24:24.190
money pit and 10x all right guys

24:24.190 --> 24:28.080
x marks the spot this is it that's where

24:28.080 --> 24:29.559
we drill the gold signature that's the

24:29.559 --> 24:32.100
gold signature the remote survey shows

24:32.100 --> 24:34.220
this to be at a hundred and eight feet

24:34.220 --> 24:36.580
and it may have as high as an 18-foot

24:36.580 --> 24:38.580
ceiling in it

24:38.580 --> 24:42.341
oh look you can if there really is a

24:42.341 --> 24:44.500
cavity under here it's a game changer

24:44.500 --> 24:48.470
but I tell you I'm skeptical the only

24:48.470 --> 24:51.080
way to confirm it is to put rod down

24:51.080 --> 24:55.630
hole what if it is it's 220 years of

24:55.630 --> 24:57.590
search and this may be the culmination

24:57.590 --> 25:00.110
of it and our hope is that you are

25:00.110 --> 25:03.950
correct I think I know two guys to be

25:03.950 --> 25:05.020
holding their breath the whole time that

25:05.020 --> 25:09.220
bits going down right could there really

25:09.220 --> 25:12.070
be a maze of treasure tunnels lying deep

25:12.070 --> 25:13.240
beneath Oak Island

25:13.240 --> 25:16.309
unfortunately proving the Leonard's

25:16.309 --> 25:19.409
incredible theory will be both difficult

25:19.409 --> 25:22.840
and expensive it also could be several

25:22.840 --> 25:25.760
weeks before Marty and Rick will be able

25:25.760 --> 25:28.059
to secure the type of drilling equipment

25:28.059 --> 25:31.279
needed to search for and hopefully find

25:31.279 --> 25:33.080
evidence that a vast network of

25:33.080 --> 25:35.290
underground treasure tunnels actually

25:35.290 --> 25:37.690
exists

25:37.690 --> 25:40.019
instant toxicated somebody says on your

25:40.019 --> 25:42.010
property there's gold right here drill

25:42.010 --> 25:43.010
right here

25:43.010 --> 25:44.909
you think yeah why not why not drill a

25:44.909 --> 25:47.110
hole right here but then we can't just

25:47.110 --> 25:48.890
drill a hole wherever somebody thinks it

25:48.890 --> 25:50.570
is so we have to do a little more

25:50.570 --> 25:52.289
diligence on this technology and we

25:52.289 --> 25:53.289
intend to

25:53.289 --> 25:58.130
but following up on the Leonard's

25:58.130 --> 26:00.830
incredible theory is just one of the

26:00.830 --> 26:03.779
many tasks that Marty and Rick will need

26:03.779 --> 26:07.730
to focus on

26:07.730 --> 26:10.690
as another day begins on Oak Island

26:10.690 --> 26:13.149
the brothers focus their energies back

26:13.149 --> 26:19.080
to 10x showed up ordered guys and the

26:19.080 --> 26:21.559
need to figure out how to get someone

26:21.559 --> 26:24.070
safely all the way down the narrow

26:24.070 --> 26:27.080
235-foot borehole

26:27.080 --> 26:30.159
hey guys we have another power chord we

26:30.159 --> 26:34.909
can 100 footer get lots of yeah today

26:34.909 --> 26:37.340
Rick and Marty have invited underwater

26:37.340 --> 26:39.900
visualization experts Brian Abbott and

26:39.900 --> 26:42.789
Nick Burchill to come back to the island

26:42.789 --> 26:46.530
and meet with them at 10x just want to

26:46.530 --> 26:49.570
do quick diagnostic Brian Abbott has had

26:49.570 --> 26:52.090
more than 20 years experience managing

26:52.090 --> 26:54.630
sonar operations for archaeological

26:54.630 --> 26:57.760
investigations police force training and

26:57.760 --> 27:00.159
even projects for the Department of

27:00.159 --> 27:04.850
Homeland Security in 2010 he was part of

27:04.850 --> 27:07.419
an elite team that was the first to map

27:07.419 --> 27:09.740
the wreck of the Titanic using sonar

27:09.740 --> 27:13.950
technology cables coming it was his data

27:13.950 --> 27:16.519
collected last summer that convinced the

27:16.519 --> 27:19.640
Oak Island team that 10x in addition to

27:19.640 --> 27:22.019
the money pit should be the focus of

27:22.019 --> 27:31.840
this year's operations if there's a

27:31.840 --> 27:33.400
great big call in the wood this is a

27:33.400 --> 27:34.400
man-made deal

27:34.400 --> 27:42.120
these are probably the lasers this year

27:42.120 --> 27:44.320
in addition to conducting another more

27:44.320 --> 27:47.110
detailed sonar scan the team will be

27:47.110 --> 27:49.570
using the spectrum 90 high-definition

27:49.570 --> 27:53.300
camera to photograph the areas of 10x

27:53.300 --> 27:55.490
where Rick and Marty will still need to

27:55.490 --> 27:57.780
clear away pipes and other dangerous

27:57.780 --> 28:00.149
debris down can you hold it up so that

28:00.149 --> 28:03.200
the ball can rotate understood with the

28:03.200 --> 28:05.570
ability to withstand depths of up to

28:05.570 --> 28:08.929
1000 feet okay the spectrum 90 can not

28:08.929 --> 28:12.880
only give a 360 degree view of the shaft

28:12.880 --> 28:15.400
it can enlarge images up to 40 times

28:15.400 --> 28:20.049
their size it also features a highly

28:20.049 --> 28:22.559
advanced laser function which will be

28:22.559 --> 28:24.980
able to give precise measurements of any

28:24.980 --> 28:36.419
objects it might encounter
is very good

28:36.419 --> 28:38.200
this doesn't look like vegetation it's

28:38.200 --> 28:40.320
it looks like chemical can it still be

28:40.320 --> 28:42.139
part of it die why not it could be the

28:42.139 --> 28:48.559
green dye still

28:48.559 --> 28:51.309
last summer as part of a test to see if

28:51.309 --> 28:53.010
the underground chambers believed to be

28:53.010 --> 28:56.799
at the bottom of 10x might connect to

28:56.799 --> 28:58.470
the money pit and out to the ocean Rick

28:58.470 --> 29:00.769
lagina and Dave Blankenship poured

29:00.769 --> 29:04.600
non-toxic green dye down 10x

29:04.600 --> 29:08.590
does anybody see any dye coming on it

29:08.590 --> 29:10.460
was a test that had been performed

29:10.460 --> 29:13.340
numerous times in the past with very

29:13.340 --> 29:17.159
results sometimes the dye would seep

29:17.159 --> 29:18.269
into the ocean

29:18.269 --> 29:19.549
sometimes it Morgan's

29:19.549 --> 29:24.100
we have a problem here since it's very

29:24.100 --> 29:28.279
green but now the remaining green dye

29:28.279 --> 29:30.190
presents yet another obstacle for the

29:30.190 --> 29:32.059
team okay keep going

29:32.059 --> 29:34.889
okay here we go this ability down the

29:34.889 --> 29:39.450
shaft is nearly zero stop okay I'm at

29:39.450 --> 29:41.389
the junction now we're directly over the

29:41.389 --> 29:43.230
27-inch shaft

29:43.230 --> 29:44.649
there's a lot of stuff on the bottom

29:44.649 --> 29:47.360
we've got plywood we've got steel

29:47.360 --> 29:49.480
there's rebar down there there's some

29:49.480 --> 29:52.080
chunks of concrete I'd really glad the

29:52.080 --> 29:53.850
divers didn't get down and get tangled

29:53.850 --> 29:56.231
in this we're centered on the hole so we

29:56.231 --> 29:57.750
got a clear shot right where we are

29:57.750 --> 30:06.190
running up and down two feet please Rick

30:06.190 --> 30:08.880
okay keep going please we should just

30:08.880 --> 30:10.970
devote me at the top of the chamber

30:10.970 --> 30:12.454
clearing the shaft we are definitely on

30:12.454 --> 30:17.460
to the pipe and into the chamber I'm

30:17.460 --> 30:20.260
gonna take it down until we see bottom

30:20.260 --> 30:22.620
ah there we are

30:22.620 --> 30:26.690
okay stop and what's that what just

30:26.690 --> 30:28.470
going on there something close

30:28.470 --> 30:33.669
it's gold those do to appear to be

30:33.669 --> 30:39.399
golden oh my god that is weird

30:39.399 --> 30:41.750
gold pieces let's do this appear to be

30:41.750 --> 30:42.750
cool oh my god

30:42.750 --> 30:45.860
while running a high-definition camera

30:45.860 --> 30:48.070
at the bottom of borehole 10-x

30:48.070 --> 30:50.950
underwater imaging expert Nick Burchell

30:50.950 --> 30:53.620
has just made what he thinks could be a

30:53.620 --> 31:00.179
startling find like flecks

31:00.179 --> 31:03.230
naturally occurring but you got to test

31:03.230 --> 31:07.960
own but they're at their golden color

31:07.960 --> 31:09.919
somebody says the magic word the magic

31:09.919 --> 31:13.010
four-letter word gold and you know

31:13.010 --> 31:14.679
initially of course the hairs on back

31:14.679 --> 31:16.640
your neck rise up and then you typical

31:16.640 --> 31:18.179
guilin you get brought back down to

31:18.179 --> 31:19.950
earth no that's just a bright spot in

31:19.950 --> 31:22.120
the end hydrate but it was interesting

31:22.120 --> 31:26.660
how that word changes people I think

31:26.660 --> 31:28.570
that word has changed the dynamic of

31:28.570 --> 31:32.169
this whole place what's to the right

31:32.169 --> 31:36.080
they're almost looking like the column

31:36.080 --> 31:38.250
there that's the post

31:38.250 --> 31:40.730
although the spectrum 90 camera may not

31:40.730 --> 31:43.350
have revealed the presence of gold it is

31:43.350 --> 31:46.169
now capturing an image that might prove

31:46.169 --> 31:48.269
that what dan Blankenship saw at the

31:48.269 --> 31:51.590
bottom of 10x more than 40 years ago was

31:51.590 --> 31:54.230
not just an illusion there's been this

31:54.230 --> 31:55.880
mystery as to whether there's a post

31:55.880 --> 31:59.080
there a big heavy timber that runs from

31:59.080 --> 32:01.940
floor to ceiling to help shore up the

32:01.940 --> 32:05.580
roof if you will of a tunnel and that's

32:05.580 --> 32:08.030
what the conjectures that that's exactly

32:08.030 --> 32:12.330
what that is it was concrete it still

32:12.330 --> 32:13.509
not the best visibility there

32:13.509 --> 32:16.590
there's so much scatter from that green

32:16.590 --> 32:19.500
die green it just throws your perception

32:19.500 --> 32:22.980
off we've got a good

32:22.980 --> 32:24.950
well are we calling it for today yeah

32:24.950 --> 32:29.259
yeah all right coming up everything

32:29.259 --> 32:32.130
hinges upon something that says men were

32:32.130 --> 32:33.789
hundreds of people over on doing

32:33.789 --> 32:36.720
something at surface until you bring

32:36.720 --> 32:39.659
something up or put eyes on it it's all

32:39.659 --> 32:48.159
conjecture

32:48.159 --> 32:51.679
a week has passed and underwater imaging

32:51.679 --> 32:54.480
experts Brian Abbott and Nick virtue

32:54.480 --> 32:56.570
have returned to Oak Island with what

32:56.570 --> 32:58.720
they promised will be the most detailed

32:58.720 --> 33:02.399
information about ten eggs to date okay

33:02.399 --> 33:05.250
amaze us okay so here we have some

33:05.250 --> 33:06.950
imagery from the bottom that's the

33:06.950 --> 33:10.179
bottom of the shaft by now it is obvious

33:10.179 --> 33:12.539
to the team that before another diver

33:12.539 --> 33:16.019
attempts to reach the bottom of the

33:16.019 --> 33:17.960
235-foot shaft it will need to be

33:17.960 --> 33:20.179
carefully checked for stability and

33:20.179 --> 33:23.320
cleared of all obstructions but what is

33:23.320 --> 33:26.940
still unknown is what if anything lies

33:26.940 --> 33:28.429
at the bottom one of the things we were

33:28.429 --> 33:30.470
looking at is the condition of the shaft

33:30.470 --> 33:34.070
itself this looks fairly structurally

33:34.070 --> 33:36.720
sound to me you did a great building

33:36.720 --> 33:46.580
that years ago
I mean I could get down

33:46.580 --> 33:48.830
there when these fellows were here last

33:48.830 --> 33:50.409
year and I saw I'd love to get down

33:50.409 --> 33:53.549
there and do some work we didn't make a

33:53.549 --> 33:55.769
lot of headway with the cameras just

33:55.769 --> 33:58.440
poor visibility it's too green that

33:58.440 --> 34:00.580
being said we went back we did some

34:00.580 --> 34:02.669
really good sonar what we did a little

34:02.669 --> 34:04.159
bit different this year is that we used

34:04.159 --> 34:05.870
a different type of sonar we were able

34:05.870 --> 34:07.880
to get more data points but also more

34:07.880 --> 34:10.389
imaging we've got ten times as much

34:10.389 --> 34:12.810
point data so we can see curves and

34:12.810 --> 34:15.340
squares and rectangles a lot easier so

34:15.340 --> 34:16.340
here's our post

34:16.340 --> 34:17.340
[Music]

34:17.340 --> 34:23.168
Wow wait don't you have to posts there

34:23.168 --> 34:25.168
and all of a sudden yes we were able to

34:25.168 --> 34:27.440
definitively find two posts that are

34:27.440 --> 34:29.780
here we've got better data on that the

34:29.780 --> 34:32.300
acoustic imaging data showed them to be

34:32.300 --> 34:33.300
squared

34:33.300 --> 34:35.230
they weren't circular and they were made

34:35.230 --> 34:38.889
on 14 inches so those targets are there

34:38.889 --> 34:40.780
they're very distinctly two posts or

34:40.780 --> 34:42.530
columns or something that's a sonar

34:42.530 --> 34:44.239
picked up which is weird because there

34:44.239 --> 34:46.500
was only one the first time but now

34:46.500 --> 34:48.418
there are two and you know it was quite

34:48.418 --> 34:50.409
significant to me that the implication

34:50.409 --> 34:52.320
is that there would and he's I think

34:52.320 --> 34:54.168
he's more than 50/50 that there would

34:54.168 --> 34:56.329
those are wooden posts that's it there's

34:56.329 --> 34:58.760
our proof

34:58.760 --> 35:00.590
we did find something I think it's it's

35:00.590 --> 35:03.780
kind of unique there's a structure down

35:03.780 --> 35:05.980
there it's it's right in this area right

35:05.980 --> 35:08.180
here it's roughly two-and-a-half feet by

35:08.180 --> 35:11.440
two feet it's got a nice curved top you

35:11.440 --> 35:14.650
think it's submerged at all and so yes

35:14.650 --> 35:16.640
now I don't know how deep it's buried it

35:16.640 --> 35:18.680
may be deeper in the sediment so maybe

35:18.680 --> 35:21.270
three feet high but it's it's an icebox

35:21.270 --> 35:26.581
that's down there a man-made what we

35:26.581 --> 35:29.240
think this box could be is a possible

35:29.240 --> 35:34.319
chest weight percent confidence that

35:34.319 --> 35:40.079
that is a man-made chest ninety percent

35:40.079 --> 35:42.690
really yeah it's it's a man-made object

35:42.690 --> 35:44.500
now whether it's hollow inside or it

35:44.500 --> 35:46.630
couldn't have come down to 27 inch

35:46.630 --> 35:51.050
because and it's not going back up by 27

35:51.050 --> 35:53.640
you get that from from what we can see

35:53.640 --> 35:55.260
the only way that that could have got

35:55.260 --> 35:58.280
into that chamber is through a tunnel

35:58.280 --> 36:03.390
90% yeah 90% you have to quote you go

36:03.390 --> 36:07.170
ahead a great problem have no it's not

36:07.170 --> 36:09.380
Mattingly frustrating we can tell you

36:09.380 --> 36:10.961
about the outside of it but we can't

36:10.961 --> 36:12.770
tell you what I understand this we're

36:12.770 --> 36:15.619
gonna find out what's inside it let's go

36:15.619 --> 36:21.310
back to this this one I don't know where

36:21.310 --> 36:23.240
to go at this one this one's unique I've

36:23.240 --> 36:25.740
talked with Nick about this part of my

36:25.740 --> 36:28.540
job because I train police and fire

36:28.540 --> 36:31.490
units on how to do evidence recovery

36:31.490 --> 36:35.050
using sonar this is the same sonar so

36:35.050 --> 36:36.790
you're not in your head looking at me

36:36.790 --> 36:44.130
where this is a body laying across here

36:44.130 --> 36:46.270
really yeah there's an object down there

36:46.270 --> 36:55.070
that looks like human remains

36:55.070 --> 36:56.970
I'm saying this is a body laying across

36:56.970 --> 36:58.620
here there's an object down there that

36:58.620 --> 37:01.589
looks like human remains yeah a human

37:01.589 --> 37:05.839
body lying at the bottom of 10-x did you

37:05.839 --> 37:07.430
see a body when you were down there

37:07.430 --> 37:11.520
definitely for decades

37:11.520 --> 37:14.240
dan Blankenship has claimed that he saw

37:14.240 --> 37:16.579
what he believed to be the remains of a

37:16.579 --> 37:20.640
dead body lying at the bottom of 10x

37:20.640 --> 37:26.150
some 235 feet underground this videotape

37:26.150 --> 37:30.300
recorded in 1971 does show a shadowy

37:30.300 --> 37:32.960
image that is eerily consistent with the

37:32.960 --> 37:38.069
one revealed by the scanning sonar

37:38.069 --> 37:40.089
I believe this body is laying face down

37:40.089 --> 37:41.859
and if you look I believe this is an

37:41.859 --> 37:46.420
elbow beers left elbow yeah could a dead

37:46.420 --> 37:50.560
body really lie at the bottom of 10-x if

37:50.560 --> 37:54.160
so how did it get there and how is it

37:54.160 --> 37:56.770
remain so relatively intact after so

37:56.770 --> 37:59.970
long wait a minute you're saying there's

37:59.970 --> 38:01.870
a body in there you're imaging a body he

38:01.870 --> 38:03.630
says there's a body where this body come

38:03.630 --> 38:05.760
from we can't explain what we're seeing

38:05.760 --> 38:07.520
all we can tell you is that's what we're

38:07.520 --> 38:10.440
seeing let me ask you something this is

38:10.440 --> 38:11.440
really weird

38:11.440 --> 38:13.660
and I want to ask you this was his head

38:13.660 --> 38:16.720
on his body or was his head kind of on

38:16.720 --> 38:28.390
the side at least we think we did okay

38:28.390 --> 38:30.230
we hit a lot of team out there we

38:30.230 --> 38:32.280
brought a lot of chains up you brought

38:32.280 --> 38:34.490
chain up did you really so we figured

38:34.490 --> 38:38.670
the body was chained to that post

38:38.670 --> 38:42.650
and we broke the chain one of the many

38:42.650 --> 38:45.170
legends about Oak Island concerns a

38:45.170 --> 38:48.240
slave one of the hundreds that many

38:48.240 --> 38:50.650
believed were forced to dig the massive

38:50.650 --> 38:52.980
network of underground tunnels and booby

38:52.980 --> 38:58.180
traps after trying to escape the slave

38:58.180 --> 39:00.390
was allegedly chained to a post deep

39:00.390 --> 39:04.640
underground and left there to die so

39:04.640 --> 39:06.839
that his ghost might guard the treasure

39:06.839 --> 39:08.849
forever

39:08.849 --> 39:11.040
put the discovery of a dead body on Oak

39:11.040 --> 39:12.040
Island

39:12.040 --> 39:14.000
mean that the centuries-old legend is

39:14.000 --> 39:16.710
true

39:16.710 --> 39:18.480
great what do you think with the daddy

39:18.480 --> 39:21.060
you brought up I mean you're sure

39:21.060 --> 39:24.109
indicating that man was down there man

39:24.109 --> 39:28.390
is still don't there so to me you're

39:28.390 --> 39:30.220
just adding more evidence that we need

39:30.220 --> 39:32.010
to get down there and the big question

39:32.010 --> 39:35.160
for us is how are we gonna do it safely

39:35.160 --> 39:38.359
I agree I'm catastrophic Allah uncatted

39:38.359 --> 39:41.790
tropically the bottom line is Marty you

39:41.790 --> 39:42.790
got a problem

39:42.790 --> 39:45.080
[Laughter]

39:45.080 --> 39:47.650
[Music]

39:47.650 --> 39:50.060
we wanted to exhaust the surface

39:50.060 --> 39:53.560
exploration first do everything we could

39:53.560 --> 39:55.500
from the surface to make those digs or

39:55.500 --> 39:57.960
that dive most safe and most productive

39:57.960 --> 40:03.980
order there now it's time to dig

40:03.980 --> 40:06.780
brothers Rick and Marty lagina along

40:06.780 --> 40:09.750
with their partners are finally ready to

40:09.750 --> 40:12.690
commit themselves to what promises to be

40:12.690 --> 40:15.250
the biggest and most expensive treasure

40:15.250 --> 40:17.880
hunting operation in the history of Oak

40:17.880 --> 40:20.480
Island

40:20.480 --> 40:24.160
there will be setbacks and danger but

40:24.160 --> 40:27.670
the rewards could be great if they can

40:27.670 --> 40:30.440
solve this 220 year old mystery

40:30.440 --> 40:33.910
but what exactly will they find a

40:33.910 --> 40:39.839
priceless cache of pirate treasure

40:39.839 --> 40:41.010
precious religious artifacts

40:41.010 --> 40:47.420
while they discover something

40:47.420 --> 40:50.170
perhaps the proof that what lies buried

40:50.170 --> 40:54.260
on Oak Island was never meant to be

40:54.260 --> 40:58.500
found at all

40:58.500 --> 41:01.869
this season on the curse of Oak Island

41:01.869 --> 41:05.080
to claim this spot we're digging on Olga

41:05.080 --> 41:07.390
@ x marks the spot

41:07.390 --> 41:10.940
isn't that a Templar cross this cross is

41:10.940 --> 41:11.940
Portuguese

41:11.940 --> 41:15.730

41:15.730 --> 41:17.420

41:17.420 --> 41:19.060
work of the Aztec empire

41:19.060 --> 41:23.770
