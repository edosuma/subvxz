I'M CRAZY FOR PICKING MARK,

BUT HONESTLY,
I KNOW HE'S A GOOD ARTIST,

06:05.323 --> 06:06.699

A GRAFFITI BACKGROUND.

06:06.783 --> 06:09.202

06:09.285 --> 06:11.746

06:21.214 --> 06:23.132
I DON'T WANT TO WORK WITH AARON

06:23.216 --> 06:25.218
BECAUSE HE'S
A COMPLETE CONTROL FREAK,

06:25.301 --> 06:27.136
AND HE ALWAYS THINKS
THAT WHAT HE KNOWS IS THE BEST.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.679

IF WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT, YEAH?

06:28.763 --> 06:29.597

{\an8}- PRECISION'S IMPORTANT
IN THIS CHALLENGE

06:56.415 --> 07:00.002

{\an8}- THEY HAVE TO BE BOLD
AND GRAPHIC,

07:08.719 --> 07:10.930
{\an8}AND THAT'S GONNA ENCOMPASS
SOLID COLOR, BOLD LINES,

07:11.013 --> 07:14.600
{\an8}AND A CREATIVE FLOW.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.269

TO DO THE BACKGROUND FIRST?

07:18.437 --> 07:19.772

THAT'S LOOKING.

YOUR SOCKS OFF?

07:38.749 --> 07:40.501

TAKE THE REINS AND LEAD

07:43.462 --> 07:45.047
{\an8}ON A FLASH CHALLENGE

07:45.131 --> 07:46.716
{\an8}BECAUSE I'M IN TEAMS
WITH SOMEONE ELSE

{\an8}THAT DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT THE HELL THEY'RE DOING.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.136

WHAT TO DO NEXT.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.264

07:53.347 --> 07:54.265

08:00.897 --> 08:02.857

08:08.571 --> 08:09.906

08:09.989 --> 08:11.949

ON THE TOP.

08:15.786 --> 08:17.622

FASTER THAN THAT, I THINK.

08:20.708 --> 08:22.043

08:48.361 --> 08:50.488
JUDGING BY THOSE TENTACLES,
I'M NOT WORRIED.

08:50.571 --> 08:51.697

THE DIRECTION WE'RE GOING?

09:03.918 --> 09:07.046
{\an8}ERIK AND I BIT OFF WAY MORE
THAN WE CAN CHEW ON THIS ONE.

09:07.129 --> 09:09.006
IT'S SUPER DETAILED.

09:09.090 --> 09:13.261
I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA FINISH.

09:13.344 --> 09:14.845
- PRESSURE IS ON.

09:14.929 --> 09:19.392
- FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

09:19.475 --> 09:21.310
THAT'S IT.
TIME IS UP.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.603
- NAILED IT.

09:22.687 --> 09:24.480
- TEAM JAPANESE?

09:24.730 --> 09:27.441
- YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
NOT EVERYBODY CAN DO DNA.

09:27.525 --> 09:29.193
{\an8}- ERIK AND JASON'S DESIGN
ISN'T EVEN FINISHED.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.320
MONSTER DNA'S NEVER GONNA PUT IT

09:31.404 --> 09:33.322
ON A PAIR
OF HALF-FINISHED HEADPHONES.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.824
NO WAY WE CAN'T WIN
THIS FLASH CHALLENGE NOW.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.329
- CLEEN AND MARK.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.290
- WE KIND OF WENT WITH A PLAY
ON THE WHOLE IDEA

09:42.373 --> 09:44.458
OF WHAT IT'S CALLED,
THE MONSTER DNA.

09:44.542 --> 09:47.503
- YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL FLOW
WITH A GREAT COLOR PALETTE.

09:47.586 --> 09:50.423
THE WAY YOU INCORPORATED
THE LOGO INTO THE ACTUAL DESIGN,

09:50.506 --> 09:52.425
YOU GUYS DID A REALLY GREAT JOB.

09:52.675 --> 09:55.886
- DEFINITELY LOOKS LIKE ONE
PERSON'S STYLE, LOTS OF DETAIL.

09:55.970 --> 09:59.640
FOR A PRECISION CHALLENGE,
YOU REALLY NAILED IT.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.517
- AARON AND CRIS.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.228
- YOUR BIG FAULT
TODAY IS PRECISION.

10:04.312 --> 10:08.482
THE LINES THAT YOU PUT IN HERE
ARE ANYTHING BUT PRECISE.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.484
THE LITTLE GREEN LINES
IN THE BACKGROUND,

10:10.568 --> 10:12.320
THEY'RE NOT
ALL THE SAME THICKNESS.

10:12.403 --> 10:14.196
THEY DON'T ALL GO
THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.115
THAT'S NOT KEEPING
YOUR DETAILS PRECISE.

10:16.198 --> 10:17.783
- YOU GUYS DID GET A LOT
OF COVERAGE DONE.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.327
HOWEVER, LEARN TO RIDE
THE SHAPE.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.329
TRY TO FIND A FLOW

10:21.412 --> 10:24.332
IN SOME WAY TO MAKE
YOUR DESIGNS MORE DYNAMIC.

10:24.415 --> 10:26.375
- JASON AND ERIK.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.295
- WELL, I GOT TO SAY, GUYS,
THAT WATER, NOT VERY FLOWY.

10:29.378 --> 10:30.379
IT'S GOT WEIRD SHAPES,

10:30.463 --> 10:32.256
AND EACH FINGER WAVE

10:32.340 --> 10:35.426
IS A DIFFERENT SHAPE FROM
ANY OF THE OTHER FINGER WAVES.

10:35.509 --> 10:37.428
- THIS BEING
A PRECISION CHALLENGE,

10:37.511 --> 10:38.804
AND ESPECIALLY ON THIS BIG
OF A SCALE,

10:38.888 --> 10:41.015
I WANT TO SEE IT A LOT TIGHTER.

10:41.098 --> 10:42.933
{\an8}- I BLAME JASON
FOR NOT FINISHING,

10:43.017 --> 10:44.352
{\an8}'CAUSE HE WANTED
TO PAINT THE BACKGROUND FIRST,

10:44.435 --> 10:45.519
{\an8}AND THAT WAS JUST A STUPID MOVE.

10:45.770 --> 10:48.773
NOW LOOK WHERE WE ARE.

10:48.856 --> 10:50.608
- TODAY WE'RE TESTING PRECISION

10:50.691 --> 10:53.235
BY DESIGNING
MONSTER DNA HEADPHONES.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.029
LET'S START OFF
WITH MARK AND CLEEN.

10:55.112 --> 10:56.906
- THEY WERE VERY PRECISE.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.908
THEIR DETAILS ARE VERY CLEAN.

10:58.991 --> 11:01.619
THEY REALLY FILLED UP
THE ENTIRE WORKSPACE.

11:01.702 --> 11:02.995
- AND THEIR COLORS
WERE REALLY SOLID,

11:03.079 --> 11:04.538
WHICH ALSO TOOK PRECISION.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.874
SO ALL IN ALL,
THE EXECUTION, LAYOUT,

11:06.957 --> 11:08.959
AND THE FLOW OF THEIR PAIR
OF HEADPHONES, REALLY NICE.

11:09.043 --> 11:11.087
- LET'S TALK
ABOUT ERIK AND JASON.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.547
- THEY DIDN'T FINISH
THEIR DESIGN, AND HONESTLY,

11:13.631 --> 11:16.592
WHAT ONE TEAM CAN DO,
ALL TEAMS SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO,

11:16.675 --> 11:18.386
AT LEAST IN COVERAGE
AND EXECUTION.

11:18.677 --> 11:20.429
- AND AT THIS POINT
IN THE COMPETITION, FOR SURE.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.264
- YEAH.
THESE GUYS ARE NOT GOING FOR IT.

11:22.348 --> 11:23.432
THEY'RE HITTING A WALL.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.017
- AARON AND CRIS.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.602
- WHAT AARON AND CRIS DID

11:26.852 --> 11:28.521
IS JUST
A VERY UNINTERESTING DESIGN,

11:28.771 --> 11:30.523
AND THE WAY
THEY FIT IT TO THE HEADPHONE,

11:30.606 --> 11:32.316
NOT REALLY VERY CREATIVE.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.944
THE TENTACLES DON'T EVEN
LOOK SMOOTH AND HAVE ANY FLOW.

11:35.027 --> 11:36.487
I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY
THE EASIEST DECISION

11:36.570 --> 11:37.947
WE'VE EVER HAD TO MAKE.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.074
- LET'S GO LET THEM KNOW.

11:40.157 --> 11:42.284
TODAY YOU HAD TO USE PRECISION

11:42.368 --> 11:45.913
TO CREATE A CUSTOM DESIGN
FOR MONSTER DNA HEADPHONES.

11:45.996 --> 11:48.666
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED
THAT THE WINNERS

11:48.749 --> 11:52.795
OF TODAY'S FLASH CHALLENGE
ARE...

11:52.878 --> 11:55.589
CLEEN AND MARK.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.508
- YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS REALLY TOOK
THE BALL AND RAN WITH IT

11:57.591 --> 11:59.427
AS FAR AS ATTACKING
AND EXECUTING

11:59.510 --> 12:01.011
AND MAKING SOMETHING HAPPEN.

12:01.095 --> 12:04.557
{\an8}- RIGHTEOUS, I WON.
JUST WHAT I NEEDED.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.600
- WHAT I'LL SAY
TO THE REST OF THE GUYS IS,

12:06.684 --> 12:09.061
MAN, DON'T MAKE IT THAT EASY
FOR SOMEBODY

12:09.145 --> 12:10.563
TO WALK AWAY WITH THE WIN.

12:10.646 --> 12:12.481
PUT UP A FIGHT.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.692
- CLEEN AND MARK,

12:14.775 --> 12:17.486
MONSTER DNA WILL PRODUCE
A LIMITED EDITION RUN

12:17.570 --> 12:19.655
OF YOUR CUSTOM HEADPHONES

12:19.905 --> 12:22.575
THAT WILL BE SOLD
ALONGSIDE CHRIS NUÑEZ'S

12:22.658 --> 12:26.495
AT HANDCRAFTED IN MIAMI
AND AT MONSTERPRODUCTS.COM.

12:26.579 --> 12:29.290
YOU'LL ALSO HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN ALL THE HUMAN CANVASES

12:29.373 --> 12:31.417
FOR THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.502
- I GOT THE SKULL PICKS,
AND I GOT TO HAVE MY DESIGN

12:33.586 --> 12:35.588
PRINTED AND MANUFACTURED
AND ON THE STORE SHELVES.

12:35.671 --> 12:38.966
I JUST WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO
SHARE THE SPOTLIGHT WITH CLEEN.

12:39.049 --> 12:40.885
- HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT
AND PREPARE TO MEET

12:40.968 --> 12:45.055
YOUR CANVASES
FOR THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.599
{\an8}- I'M NOT GOING DOWN.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.434
{\an8}- THERE AIN'T NO WAY
YOU'RE GOING TO THE FINALE.

12:48.517 --> 12:50.144
{\an8}- DON'T [bleep] WITH ME,
ALL RIGHT?

12:50.227 --> 12:51.979
- THERE IS ONE MORE THING.
- WHAT?

12:52.062 --> 12:53.522
- I AM [bleep]
IF I DON'T GET THIS RIGHT.

12:58.652 --> 13:01.780
- I FEEL A LOT
OF [bleep] PRESSURE RIGHT NOW.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.200
LAST TIME I WENT HOME
IN SIXTH PLACE,

13:04.283 --> 13:05.993
AND THIS IS SIXTH PLACE.
- OH.

13:06.076 --> 13:07.745
- THIS ELIMINATION
WAS THE LAST ONE--

13:07.828 --> 13:09.205
- THIS ELIMINATION--
THAT'S RIGHT.

13:09.288 --> 13:10.623
SO I NEED TO GET BEYOND THAT.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.583
- THE LAST TWO PIECES YOU DID,

13:12.666 --> 13:14.293
THEY WERE READY
TO BOOT YOUR ASS OUT ALREADY.

13:14.376 --> 13:16.128
- SO WHAT?
I HAVE UPS AND DOWNS.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.130
- BUT YOU MAKE ONE HICCUP,
AND IT'LL BE--

13:18.214 --> 13:20.382
- WELL, I DON'T INTEND
ON DOING THAT, SO I DON'T

13:20.466 --> 13:22.593
EVEN WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
- AND IF THEY ALREADY THINK--

13:22.676 --> 13:24.637
- SO WE DON'T EVEN NEED TO HAVE
THIS [bleep] DISCUSSION...

13:24.720 --> 13:25.596
- I'M JUST SAYING.
- BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING DOWN.

13:25.679 --> 13:26.639
- OKAY.

13:26.722 --> 13:28.474
MIND YOUR ANXIETY,

13:28.557 --> 13:30.643
'CAUSE THERE AIN'T NO WAY
YOU'RE GOING TO THE FINALE

13:30.726 --> 13:32.645
IF YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT THAT BULL[bleep].

13:32.895 --> 13:34.730
- IF THIS IS YOUR WAY OF TRYING
TO GET IN MY [bleep] HEAD...

13:34.813 --> 13:36.690
- I'M JUST SAYING.
- THINK AGAIN, BRO,

13:36.774 --> 13:38.442
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE
[bleep] ANXIETY.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.194
- I'M NOT TRYING
TO DRIVE YOU NUTS.

13:40.277 --> 13:42.071
- DON'T [bleep] WITH ME,
ALL RIGHT?

13:42.154 --> 13:43.489
YOU JUST LEAVE MY BUSINESS
TO MY BUSINESS.

13:43.572 --> 13:45.574
YOU HANDLE YOUR OWN [bleep].

13:45.658 --> 13:46.951
- I'M HAVING A CONVERSATION
WITH YOU ABOUT THIS COMPETITION.

13:47.034 --> 13:48.410
- YOU CALL THAT A CONVERSATION?

13:48.494 --> 13:49.703
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET IN MY HEAD.

13:49.787 --> 13:51.580
DUDE, I JUST WENT DOWN THERE.

13:51.664 --> 13:52.498
I HAD TO FIGHT
FOR MY [bleep] LIFE.

13:52.581 --> 13:54.667
- AND YOU'RE DONE WITH IT.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.502
- THE LAST THING I NEED
IS FOR A DUDE WEARING A HOT DOG

13:56.585 --> 13:57.002
AROUND HIS NECK
TO TALK [bleep] ABOUT ME.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.678
- WELCOME TO THIS WEEK'S
ELIMINATION TATTOO.

14:05.970 --> 14:10.015
NAIL IT, AND YOU'LL BE
ONE STEP CLOSER TO $100,000,

14:10.099 --> 14:11.600
A FEATURE IN <i> INKED</i> MAGAZINE,

14:11.684 --> 14:13.686
AND THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

14:13.978 --> 14:16.605
YOU'LL BE JUDGED
BY OLIVER PECK, CHRIS NUÑEZ,

14:16.689 --> 14:18.691
AND MYSELF.

14:18.774 --> 14:21.735
BUT THIS WEEK, WE HAVE
A VERY SPECIAL GUEST JUDGE.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.821
A SECOND-GENERATION ARTIST

14:23.904 --> 14:25.823
TAUGHT BY HIS FATHER
AT A YOUNG AGE,

14:25.906 --> 14:28.242
HE'S BEEN TATTOOING
FOR OVER 20 YEARS.

14:28.325 --> 14:30.619
THE OWNER
OF SALTWATER TATTOO SUPPLY

14:30.869 --> 14:36.625
AND CLASSIC TATTOO
IN FULLERTON, CALIFORNIA,

14:36.709 --> 14:38.085
MR. TIM HENDRICKS.
- HENDRICKS.

14:38.168 --> 14:40.504
- WHAT?
- OH, MY GOD.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.631
- I DO ALL KINDS OF STYLES,

14:42.715 --> 14:44.633
BUT I'M BEST KNOWN
FOR MY PORTRAITS.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.635
{\an8}AS A GUEST JUDGE,

14:46.719 --> 14:48.637
{\an8}I'M GONNA BE LOOKING FOR
THE FUNDAMENTALS OF TATTOOING.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.598
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

14:50.681 --> 14:52.266
IF YOU'RE GONNA WIN
THE TITLE OF INK MASTER,

14:52.349 --> 14:53.851
YOU BETTER BE GOOD
AT EVERYTHING.

14:53.934 --> 14:55.769
HEY, GUYS.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.271
- WHAT'S UP?
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:57.354 --> 14:59.189
{\an8}- EVERYTHING THIS GUY DOES
IS AMAZING.

14:59.273 --> 15:01.150
HE IS THE BAR
THAT I TRY TO SET MYSELF AT,

15:01.233 --> 15:02.651
SO I'M DEFINITELY
GONNA BE ON MY GAME.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.528
- THAT'S AWESOME.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.447
- AS YOU KNOW,
WE'RE NOT YOUR ONLY CRITICS.

15:06.530 --> 15:09.658
EACH WEEK, YOU'LL ALSO
BE JUDGED BY AMERICA.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.703
VIEWERS AT HOME
WILL SCOUR EVERY DETAIL

15:12.786 --> 15:15.748
OF YOUR ELIMINATION TATTOO
AT INKMASTER.SPIKE.COM

15:16.040 --> 15:18.292
AND VOTE FOR THE TATTOO
THAT THEY THINK IS THE BEST.

15:18.375 --> 15:20.628
AMERICA'S VOTE
WILL HAVE A MASSIVE IMPACT

15:20.711 --> 15:22.755
AT THE LIVE FINALE.

15:22.838 --> 15:26.216
THIS WEEK,
WE'RE TESTING PRECISION.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.427
{\an8}- PRECISION IS MAKING SURE
ALL THE LITTLE DETAILS

15:28.510 --> 15:30.638
{\an8}IN YOUR DESIGN
ARE EXACT AND PERFECT.

15:30.929 --> 15:36.977
{\an8}- TODAY, YOU MUST TATTOO
THE ULTIMATE TEST OF PRECISION,

15:37.061 --> 15:39.396
{\an8}A PORTRAIT.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.565
{\an8}- OH, DAMN.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.609
{\an8}IS THE UNIVERSE
MESSING WITH ME RIGHT NOW?

15:43.692 --> 15:47.321
{\an8}I GOT ELIMINATED ON PORTRAIT DAY
LAST TIME I COMPETED.

15:47.404 --> 15:49.281
- YOU DIDN'T DO
A HORRIBLE TATTOO,

15:49.365 --> 15:51.533
BUT THE EAR, THE HAIR,
THE GLASSES--

15:51.617 --> 15:53.410
IT'S THOSE DETAILS
THAT ARE WRONG.

15:53.494 --> 15:54.828
- FOR SOME REASON,
THE DAMN STENCIL JUST

15:54.912 --> 15:56.538
DIDN'T COME OUT STRONG ENOUGH.

15:56.622 --> 15:57.790
- WE CAN'T
OVERLOOK THESE MISTAKES

15:57.873 --> 15:59.792
WHEN WE'RE JUDGING ACCURACY.

15:59.875 --> 16:02.127
- I HAVE TO REDEEM MYSELF.

16:02.211 --> 16:05.714
- A PORTRAIT IS ONE OF
THE EASIEST TATTOOS TO SCREW UP.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.508
ONE DROP OF INK
IN THE WRONG PLACE

16:07.591 --> 16:09.718
WILL MAKE YOUR PORTRAIT
UNRECOGNIZABLE.

16:09.802 --> 16:13.514
{\an8}- IF YOU ALTER THE APPEARANCE
OF SOMEBODY'S FACE IN A TATTOO,

16:13.597 --> 16:15.599
{\an8}YOU JUST MADE IT
INTO SOMEBODY ELSE.

16:15.683 --> 16:17.184
- TODAY, ONCE AGAIN,

16:17.267 --> 16:19.895
THE CANVASES ARE IN PAIRS.

16:19.978 --> 16:22.064
EVERY CANVAS
WANTS THE SAME PORTRAIT

16:22.147 --> 16:24.858
AS ONE OTHER CANVAS...
- WOW.

16:24.942 --> 16:28.487
- GIVING A SIDE-BY-SIDE
COMPARISON LIKE NEVER BEFORE.

16:28.570 --> 16:29.738
- WHAT?
- OH, MY GOD.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.699
- GO BIG OR GO HOME.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.659
- THAT MEANS YOU'LL ALL BE
GOING HEAD-TO-HEAD

16:33.742 --> 16:35.744
WITH ONE OTHER ARTIST.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.872
THE JUDGES WILL DIRECTLY COMPARE
YOUR WORK IN CRITIQUE.

16:38.956 --> 16:39.832
ONE OF YOU WILL WIN,

16:40.082 --> 16:41.500
AND ONE OF YOU WILL LOSE.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.669
{\an8}- CAN'T LOSE.

16:43.752 --> 16:46.255
{\an8}- THIS IS THE ULTIMATE
HEAD-TO-HEAD, STRAIGHT UP,

16:46.338 --> 16:48.799
{\an8}AND I AM [bleep]
IF I DON'T GET THIS RIGHT.

16:49.049 --> 16:50.843
- THERE IS ONE MORE THING.

16:50.926 --> 16:52.761
YOUR CANVASES HAVE BROUGHT

16:52.845 --> 16:55.764
THE SUBJECT OF THEIR PORTRAIT
ALONG WITH THEM.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.766
- THAT'S [bleep].
- THIS IS CRAZY.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.017
- LET'S MEET YOUR CANVASES.

17:03.814 --> 17:06.233
CANVASES,
PLEASE REVEAL THE PORTRAIT

17:06.316 --> 17:07.317
THAT THE ARTIST
WILL BE TATTOOING.

17:15.784 --> 17:18.619
- CLEEN AND MARK,
YOU WON THE FLASH CHALLENGE.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.915
YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.375
YOU'RE ALSO DETERMINING
WHICH ARTISTS

17:23.459 --> 17:24.835
TATTOO HEAD-TO-HEAD.

17:24.917 --> 17:26.878
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER

17:26.962 --> 17:29.423
TO BE SMART ABOUT
WHO YOU PIT AGAINST ONE ANOTHER.

17:29.506 --> 17:30.758
- READY?
- LET'S DO IT.

17:34.011 --> 17:34.678
{\an8}- I'VE HAD A LOT
OF UPS AND DOWNS

17:34.762 --> 17:36.930
{\an8}IN THIS COMPETITION SO FAR.

17:37.014 --> 17:38.724
{\an8}SO I'M GONNA MAKE SURE THAT
I GET THE COOLEST DESIGN I CAN,

17:38.807 --> 17:39.933
{\an8}AND I'M GONNA TAKE OUT
A TOP DOG,

17:40.017 --> 17:41.518
{\an8}PROVE THAT I DESERVE TO BE HERE.

17:41.602 --> 17:42.811
{\an8}LOOK AT THAT HANDSOME GUY.

17:43.061 --> 17:44.855
{\an8}- AT THIS POINT
IN THE COMPETITION,

17:44.938 --> 17:46.523
{\an8}I JUST WANT TO STEAMROLL
ALL THESE WEAK LINKS

17:46.607 --> 17:48.275
{\an8}IN THE HOUSE AND GET RID
OF SOME OF THE TRASH.

17:48.358 --> 17:49.818
{\an8}WHERE DO YOU PLAN
ON GETTING THIS?

17:49.902 --> 17:51.945
{\an8}- RIGHT HERE ON MY RIBS.
- [exhales]

17:52.196 --> 17:55.324
{\an8}THE LAST PLACE I WANT TO PUT
A PORTRAIT IS THE RIBS.

17:55.407 --> 17:56.784
{\an8}- ARE YOU OPEN TO MOVE IT
OFF THE RIBS?

17:56.867 --> 17:58.494
{\an8}- NO.
- IT'S GONNA SUCK.

17:58.577 --> 17:59.995
{\an8}- THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL PICTURE.
- THANK YOU.

18:00.245 --> 18:01.789
{\an8}- WHERE ARE YOU GUYS
PLANNING ON PUTTING THIS?

18:01.872 --> 18:02.915
{\an8}- ON THE SIDE OF MY THIGH.
- NICE.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.005
- SO WE'RE DOING A LITTLE GIRL?
- YES.

18:10.255 --> 18:11.840
{\an8}- DOING PORTRAITS
OF YOUNGER CHILDREN

18:11.924 --> 18:13.801
{\an8}IS VERY DIFFICULT

18:13.884 --> 18:16.804
{\an8}BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE
DEFINITIVE LINES IN THEIR FACES.

18:16.887 --> 18:18.806
IF YOU PUT A LITTLE
TOO MUCH SHADING ANYWHERE,

18:18.889 --> 18:20.557
THIS WHOLE THING
IS GOING TO HELL.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.810
WHO WE GIVING THE RIB SHOT TO?

18:31.151 --> 18:32.236
OKAY.

18:35.864 --> 18:38.492
{\an8}- I'M STOKED.

18:38.575 --> 18:40.869
- CANVASES, ONE BY ONE,

18:40.953 --> 18:43.372
PLEASE READ THE ARTIST'S NAME
ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SKULL.

18:43.455 --> 18:44.706
- JASON.
- THE RIBS.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.625
{\an8}THAT'S GONNA KILL ME.

18:46.708 --> 18:48.293
{\an8}- CLEEN ROCK ONE.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.254
{\an8}- I'VE NEVER GONE HEAD-TO-HEAD
WITH JASON,

18:50.337 --> 18:51.964
{\an8}SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT
I BEAT EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE

18:52.047 --> 18:55.008
{\an8}AT LEAST ONCE.

18:55.092 --> 18:57.344
- ERIK.

19:03.475 --> 19:04.643
- MARK.
- BOOM.

19:04.726 --> 19:07.813
- OH, [bleep] [bleep].

19:07.896 --> 19:09.356
{\an8}- PEOPLE MIGHT THINK I'M CRAZY,

19:09.439 --> 19:10.440
{\an8}BUT I'M TAKING THE BULL
BY THE HORNS HERE.

19:10.524 --> 19:13.694
{\an8}ERIK'S GOING DOWN.

19:13.777 --> 19:15.028
{\an8}- AARON.
- RIGHT HERE.

19:15.112 --> 19:16.947
{\an8}I SPECIALIZE IN PORTRAIT WORK,

19:17.030 --> 19:20.075
{\an8}SO I WOULD GO HEAD-TO-HEAD
AGAINST ANYONE.

19:20.158 --> 19:22.494
- CRIS.

19:22.578 --> 19:23.829
- TOTALLY CONFIDENT.
THIS ONE'S MINE.

19:28.917 --> 19:30.836
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS, REMEMBER,
AFTER THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

19:30.919 --> 19:33.422
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
WILL VOTE ON THE TATTOO

19:33.505 --> 19:35.716
THAT THEY THINK IS THE WORST
AND PUT ONE ARTIST

19:35.799 --> 19:37.718
UP FOR ELIMINATION.

19:37.801 --> 19:41.096
YOU WILL HAVE SIX HOURS
TO TATTOO YOUR PORTRAIT.

19:41.346 --> 19:45.809
BASED ON YOUR WORK,
ONE OF YOU WILL CLOSE SHOP.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.019
GOOD LUCK.

19:47.102 --> 19:48.854
- ALL RIGHT, MAN.

19:48.937 --> 19:50.731
- HOW'S IT GOING, MAN?
- WHAT'S UP?

19:50.814 --> 19:51.940
- YOU READY FOR THIS?
- YEAH, I'M READY.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.358
{\an8}- THERE IS NO BETTER TEST

19:53.442 --> 19:54.818
{\an8}OF PRECISION
THAN A PORTRAIT TATTOO.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.987
- YOU ARE IN VERY GOOD HANDS.

19:57.070 --> 19:59.281
- IF YOU MESS UP A DETAIL,
YOU CHANGE THAT PERSON'S FACE.

19:59.364 --> 20:02.034
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE PERFECT,
OR YOU FAIL.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.994
- THAT'S PERFECT, RIGHT THERE.

20:04.077 --> 20:05.746
- YEAH, I LIKE THAT A LOT.

20:05.829 --> 20:07.873
- THAT'S YOUR SISTER, I TAKE IT?
- YES.

20:07.956 --> 20:10.083
- YOU'RE BOTH GONNA
GET GREAT TATTOOS.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.377
ERIK'S AN AMAZING ARTIST,
SO IT'S GONNA BE A REAL BATTLE.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.129
- I'M PROBABLY GONNA BLOW IT UP
A LITTLE BIGGER THAN THAT, TOO.

20:14.379 --> 20:16.173
- THAT'S NO PROBLEM.
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

20:16.256 --> 20:18.050
THE BIGGER, THE BETTER.
- IT'S BACKWARDS.

20:18.133 --> 20:20.010
- 'CAUSE SHE'S LOOKING STRAIGHT,
THOUGH.

20:20.093 --> 20:21.053
- YEAH, BUT YOU SEE, LIKE,
HOW IT'S--

20:21.303 --> 20:22.971
SEE HOW HER FACE IS THAT WAY?

20:23.055 --> 20:24.973
- FACING THAT WAY.
- YEAH, YEAH.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.141
SO THE FACE IS--IS ANGLED.
- OKAY, SO LET'S--

20:26.391 --> 20:27.517
- SO IT WOULD BE BACKWARDS.

20:27.601 --> 20:28.977
{\an8}I NEED TO GET THIS CANVAS

20:29.061 --> 20:31.104
{\an8}TO MOVE HIS PLACEMENT,
BECAUSE THE WAY

20:31.188 --> 20:32.105
THAT HIS DAUGHTER
IS FACING IN THIS PHOTO,

20:32.397 --> 20:34.399
IT'S GONNA BE BACKWARDS ON HIM.

20:34.483 --> 20:35.901
IT'S GONNA BE BREAKING EVERY LAW
THAT'S IN TATTOOING.

20:35.984 --> 20:37.986
IDEALLY,
IT WOULD BE GREAT THERE.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.905
- ON THE FOREARM.
- I KNOW PORTRAITS.

20:39.988 --> 20:41.990
THEY ALWAYS LOOK GOOD THERE,
MAN.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.117
IT'S JUST--IT'S JUST A SPOT THAT
YOU JUST DO IT THAT LOOKS GREAT.

20:44.201 --> 20:44.910
I DON'T WANT
TO PRESSURE YOU JUST BECAUSE,

20:44.993 --> 20:47.079
YOU KNOW, ALL THIS,

20:47.162 --> 20:49.539
BUT IT'S JUST
SUCH AN EASIER SPOT TO DO.

20:49.623 --> 20:50.958
- NOW, WHAT WAS THE DISCREPANCY
OUT THERE?

20:51.041 --> 20:53.001
YOU WANTED IT ON YOUR RIBS,

20:53.085 --> 20:55.629
BUT RIB TATTOOS HURT LIKE HELL,
AND THEY ARE HARDER TO DO.

20:55.712 --> 20:57.130
{\an8}- YEAH, OH, YEAH.
- THEY TAKE LONGER TO DO.

20:57.381 --> 20:59.174
{\an8}I REALLY HAVE TO CONVINCE
MY CANVAS RIGHT NOW

20:59.424 --> 21:01.510
{\an8}TO GET THIS OFF THE RIBS.

21:01.593 --> 21:03.011
IS THERE ANY WAY
TO TALK YOU INTO ANOTHER AREA?

21:03.095 --> 21:04.596
- NO.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.473
- OKAY.
- NO.

21:06.556 --> 21:07.891
- I HAVE SO MUCH ON THE LINE
RIGHT HERE,

21:07.975 --> 21:10.060
BUT HE'S NOT BUDGING AT ALL.

21:10.143 --> 21:12.020
- IT'S MY FATHER, AND I ALWAYS
WANT HIM CLOSE TO MY SIDE

21:12.104 --> 21:13.021
WHEN HE'S ALIVE, AND,

21:13.271 --> 21:15.023
GOD FORBID, HE PASSES AWAY,

21:15.107 --> 21:16.441
I STILL WANT TO KEEP HIM
BY MY SIDE.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.402
- I CAN'T GO HOME ON PORTRAITS.

21:18.485 --> 21:20.070
I NEED THIS CANVAS
TO MOVE THIS DAMN TATTOO.

21:31.665 --> 21:34.167
- THAT'S NOT BAD.
I LIKE THAT ONE.

21:34.251 --> 21:37.212
- I THINK IT'S A HARD ONE, MAN.

21:37.295 --> 21:39.464
AND I'M COMPETING
AGAINST SOMEBODY REALLY GOOD.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.425
- I DON'T KNOW
HOW GOOD HE IS AT PORTRAITS.

21:41.508 --> 21:44.052
I'M THE BEST PORTRAIT TATTOOER
IN THE BUILDING.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.054
IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.181
- AARON'S BEING
A COCKY SON OF A BITCH,

21:48.265 --> 21:50.183
RUNNING AROUND SAYING
THAT HE'S THE KING OF PORTRAITS.

21:50.267 --> 21:51.893
IT'S SO ANNOYING.

21:51.977 --> 21:53.770
I WANT TO WATCH
AARON FAIL TODAY.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.814
AARON, YOU BETTER BRING IT,
MOTHER[bleep].

21:55.897 --> 21:58.150
FINALLY GET TO GO UP
AGAINST EACH OTHER AGAIN, MAN.

21:58.233 --> 22:00.152
- I'M NOT WORRIED.
- IT'S GONNA BE GOOD [bleep].

22:00.402 --> 22:03.280
- PART OF ME WAS HOPING YOU'D
HANG AROUND A LITTLE LONGER.

22:03.363 --> 22:05.073
TOP FIVE, BABY.
- MM-HMM.

22:05.157 --> 22:09.244
- TOP FIVE.

22:09.327 --> 22:11.913
- YOU HAVE SIX HOURS
TO DEMONSTRATE PRECISION

22:11.997 --> 22:14.082
BY TATTOOING A PORTRAIT,

22:14.166 --> 22:18.754
AND YOUR TIME BEGINS NOW.

22:18.837 --> 22:21.048
- LET'S DO THIS, MAN.
- LET'S GET THIS GOING.

22:21.131 --> 22:23.008
{\an8}- TODAY, THESE ARTISTS
REALLY HAVE TO SHOW PRECISION

22:23.091 --> 22:25.927
{\an8}BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO REALLY
SHOWCASE THE SUBTLE DETAILS

22:26.011 --> 22:29.222
{\an8}THAT MAKE THAT PERSON COME ALIVE
TO THEIR FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

22:29.306 --> 22:30.182
- I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

22:30.432 --> 22:32.267
- IT'S MUCH TOUGHER TO GO

22:32.350 --> 22:34.186
HEAD-TO-HEAD
DOING THE EXACT SAME PHOTO

22:34.269 --> 22:35.854
BECAUSE THE WEAKNESSES
ARE COMPLETELY OBVIOUS.

22:35.937 --> 22:37.647
- OKAY, READY?

22:44.154 --> 22:45.489
{\an8}- I'M SWEATING BULLETS
RIGHT NOW.

22:45.572 --> 22:46.698
{\an8}PORTRAITS ARE NOT MY THING.

22:46.782 --> 22:47.991
{\an8}I'M GOING UP AGAINST ERIK,

22:48.075 --> 22:49.493
{\an8}AND THERE'S NO MARGIN FOR ERROR.

22:49.576 --> 22:51.745
{\an8}- YOU CHOSE TO PUT YOURSELF UP
WITH ERIK.

22:51.828 --> 22:53.205
WHY'D YOU MAKE THAT CHOICE?

22:53.288 --> 22:55.040
- I FIGURED IT'D BE A GOOD PUSH.

22:55.123 --> 22:57.250
IT WOULD BE
A REALLY GREAT CHALLENGE.

22:57.334 --> 22:59.086
MY STRATEGY ON THIS PORTRAIT
IS TO USE ALL THE PRECISION

22:59.169 --> 23:00.962
I CAN IN THE EYES,
THE NOSE, THE MOUTH,

23:01.046 --> 23:02.089
AND MAKE IT LOOK EXACTLY
LIKE HIS MOTHER.

23:02.172 --> 23:04.132
I'M NOT SCARED.

23:04.216 --> 23:05.300
I'M GONNA MAKE SURE
I GO BEYOND TO GET THIS WIN.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.677
- OH, WOW.

23:07.761 --> 23:09.387
I LOVE IT.
- RIGHT?

23:09.471 --> 23:13.058
- YEAH. THAT'S AWESOME.
- COOL.

23:13.141 --> 23:14.810
{\an8}THERE'S NO CHANCE IN HELL
THAT MARK'S GONNA BEAT ME TODAY

23:14.893 --> 23:16.061
{\an8}ON THIS PORTRAIT CHALLENGE.

23:16.144 --> 23:17.521
{\an8}I'M ALWAYS PUSHING THE LIMITS.

23:17.604 --> 23:19.648
{\an8}I'M ALWAYS TRYING
TO BE INNOVATIVE.

23:19.731 --> 23:21.900
{\an8}- YEAH, SOME STUFF

23:21.983 --> 23:24.820
{\an8}JUST TO FINISH IT OFF NICELY,
SO IT'LL LOOK COOL.

23:24.903 --> 23:26.905
- WELL, IT'S LOOKING GOOD.
IF I BEAT ERIK,

23:26.988 --> 23:29.032
THE JUDGES ARE DEFINITELY GONNA
HAVE TO TAKE NOTICE.

23:29.116 --> 23:31.284
MY WHOLE STRATEGY RIGHT NOW
IS TO GO BIG OR GO HOME.

23:31.535 --> 23:33.495
- FOUR HOURS REMAINING.

23:42.546 --> 23:45.298
{\an8}- I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME I DID A PORTRAIT.

23:45.382 --> 23:47.134
{\an8}EVEN THOUGH I DON'T DO PORTRAITS
ON A DAILY BASIS,

23:47.217 --> 23:49.136
{\an8}I KNOW I'M GONNA BEAT JASON.

23:49.219 --> 23:51.555
I'VE WORKED MY ASS OFF
TO BE WHERE I'M AT.

23:51.638 --> 23:54.224
I AM STRAIGHT EDGE.
I STAY AT HOME, AND I DRAW,

23:54.307 --> 23:56.852
AND I PAINT SO THAT I CAN GO IN,
KILL IT EVERY TIME.

23:56.935 --> 23:58.145
I CAME TO JUST DO MY BEST.

24:02.983 --> 24:06.945
- OH, MY GOD.
- YEAH, THE RIBS ARE NO JOKE.

24:07.028 --> 24:09.239
{\an8}I'M HERE FOR REDEMPTION,
AND I HAVE GOT TO BEAT CLEEN.

24:09.322 --> 24:11.324
{\an8}- [bleep].

24:11.408 --> 24:12.993
- YOU'RE A WARRIOR, DUDE.

24:13.076 --> 24:15.162
I HAVE MY WORK CUT OUT FOR ME,

24:15.245 --> 24:17.205
AND I HAVE SO MUCH ON THE LINE
RIGHT HERE.

24:17.289 --> 24:20.292
I GOT KICKED OFF IN THE PORTRAIT
CHALLENGE ON SEASON THREE,

24:20.375 --> 24:22.210
AND I'M NOT GETTING KICKED OFF
AGAIN.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.545
- AH!
- ONE MORE HOUR REMAINING.

24:27.549 --> 24:30.302
- OW, OW, OW, OW, OW, OW.

24:30.385 --> 24:33.805
{\an8}- YOU CAN DO IT.

24:33.889 --> 24:36.099
{\an8}- HOW YOU DOING, BUD?
- WHAT'S UP, MAN?

24:36.183 --> 24:38.310
{\an8}I DO COLOR PORTRAITS,
NOT BLACK AND GRAY.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.228
{\an8}I'M REALLY TRYING
TO TAKE MY TIME HERE.

24:40.312 --> 24:43.273
{\an8}ONE MISTAKE,
THIS PORTRAIT IS DONE.

24:43.356 --> 24:45.942
ANY LITTLE SLIPUP, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA RECOGNIZE THE PERSON.

24:46.026 --> 24:49.362
- DO YOU WAIT TO DO, LIKE,
SOME OF THE HEAVY, HEAVY DARKS?

24:49.446 --> 24:51.323
- I DON'T KNOW, I GUESS--I GUESS
IT DEPENDS ON THE PORTRAITS,

24:51.406 --> 24:52.991
REALLY,
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.

24:53.074 --> 24:55.827
- CRIS' TATTOO
LOOKS VERY SLOPPY.

24:55.911 --> 24:57.329
IF HE DOESN'T GO BACK IN
AND SMOOTH THAT OUT,

24:57.579 --> 24:58.788
THAT COULD BE THE KISS OF DEATH.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.293
- MM.

25:03.543 --> 25:05.378
{\an8}- THIS IS ONE OF THE SCARIEST,

25:05.462 --> 25:07.797
{\an8}MOST INTIMIDATING CHALLENGES
OF THE ENTIRE COMPETITION,

25:07.881 --> 25:10.467
{\an8}AND THIS IS THE ONE THAT I'VE
BEEN READY FOR SINCE DAY ONE.

25:10.550 --> 25:13.637
- [groans]
- STAY WITH ME.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.847
WE'RE ALMOST TO THE END, OKAY?
- MM-HMM.

25:15.931 --> 25:17.140
- I'M READY TO WATCH EVERYBODY
ELSE FALL DOWN AND ME TO RISE.

25:17.224 --> 25:20.268
THIS MAY BE ONE OF MY BEST WINS.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.979
THIS IS WHAT'S GONNA PUT US
IN THE WINNER'S CIRCLE, OKAY?

25:25.357 --> 25:27.442
- TEN, NINE,

25:27.525 --> 25:29.569
EIGHT, SEVEN,

25:29.653 --> 25:32.822
SIX, FIVE, FOUR,

25:32.906 --> 25:36.284
THREE, TWO, ONE.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.370
THAT'S IT. TIME'S UP.
MACHINES DOWN.

25:38.620 --> 25:40.455
NO MORE TATTOOING.

25:40.538 --> 25:44.960
- ALL RIGHT, MAN.
DONE.

25:45.043 --> 25:46.419
- THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL TATTOO.
- YEAH.

25:46.503 --> 25:48.171
I'M GONNA CHERISH THIS FOREVER.

25:48.255 --> 25:49.923
- NICE. IT'S AMAZING.
- IT'S GOOD.

25:50.006 --> 25:50.882
I GET TO SEE THIS
WHILE I'M ALIVE.

25:50.966 --> 25:52.300
- YEAH.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.135
- WOW.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.263
YOU KILLED IT, BRO.
- THANKS.

25:56.346 --> 25:58.390
- THANK YOU.
- LOVE YOU.

25:58.473 --> 26:00.100
- I LOVE IT.
I CAN'T WAIT TO WEAR SHORTS.

26:00.183 --> 26:01.893
- IT LOOKS LIKE MOM?
- YES.

26:01.977 --> 26:03.853
- EVERYONE WANTS TO SEE.

26:03.937 --> 26:06.064
- OH, DAMN.

26:06.147 --> 26:08.316
- ERIK'S TATTOO DOES NOT LOOK
LIKE THE REFERENCE PHOTO.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.485
IT LOOKS MORE LIKE A COMIC BOOK
CHARACTER WITH A CHEF'S HAT.

26:10.568 --> 26:12.362
ERIK HAS A VERY INFLATED VIEW
OF HIS OWN SKILLS,

26:12.612 --> 26:15.490
AND HE NEEDS TO BE NERVOUS.

26:15.740 --> 26:18.118
{\an8}- HE CLAIMS TO BE THE [bleep]
PORTRAIT KING OVER HERE.

26:18.201 --> 26:19.911
{\an8}- DING, DING, DING!
IT'S ON.

26:19.995 --> 26:21.913
- YOU [bleep] KILLED IT.

26:21.997 --> 26:24.291
- WE DON'T HAVE A CLEAR WINNER
OR A CLEAR LOSER.

26:24.374 --> 26:25.917
- I'M NOT PICKING.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.799
- YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
LOOK FRAZZLED 'CAUSE I WON.

26:32.882 --> 26:34.050
- YEAH?
- HOW MUCH YOU WANT TO BET?

26:34.134 --> 26:35.468
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

26:35.552 --> 26:37.345
- I'D PUT MONEY ON THE FACT

26:37.429 --> 26:39.472
THAT I JUST
BEAT YOU HEAD-TO-HEAD AGAIN.

26:39.556 --> 26:41.182
- DING, DING, DING, IT'S ON.
- NO, IT'S OVER ALREADY.

26:41.266 --> 26:42.976
- OH.
- OH.

26:43.059 --> 26:45.145
- I KNEW HALFWAY THROUGH
THAT I WON.

26:45.228 --> 26:46.396
- SO ARE YOU SAYING THAT
YOU WON THE WHOLE ENTIRE DAY?

26:46.479 --> 26:48.440
- NO, I KNOW I WON AGAINST--

26:48.523 --> 26:50.317
- WHOA, WHY ARE YOU
NOT CONFIDENT ENOUGH

26:50.400 --> 26:51.818
THAT YOU DIDN'T WIN
THE WHOLE DAY, THEN?

26:51.901 --> 26:53.611
- DID YOU?
- YEAH, I DID.

26:53.695 --> 26:54.863
- YOU WON THE WHOLE DAY?
- YEAH, I DID.

26:54.946 --> 26:56.489
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,

26:56.573 --> 26:58.408
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
- WHOA.

26:58.658 --> 27:00.243
- HE CLAIMS TO BE THE [bleep]
PORTRAIT KING OVER HERE.

27:00.327 --> 27:01.536
- YOU DO CLAIM
THAT YOU'RE THE PORTRAIT GUY.

27:01.619 --> 27:03.371
- YEAH.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.373
- I'LL PUT MONEY ON IT,
'CAUSE MY PORTRAIT

27:05.457 --> 27:06.750
LOOKS LIKE A PORTRAIT.
- NO, YOU--PORTRAIT KING.

27:06.833 --> 27:08.710
- WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO TO--

27:08.793 --> 27:10.503
- NO PROBLEM, PORTRAIT KING.
- PORTRAIT KING?

27:10.587 --> 27:12.422
- PORTRAIT KING.
- PORTRAIT KING.

27:12.672 --> 27:14.466
- IT'S JUST ONE OF MY FORTES.
- KING OF THE PORTRAITS.

27:14.758 --> 27:15.967
- IF YOU DON'T WIN,
HOW'S THAT GONNA MAKE YOU FEEL?

27:16.051 --> 27:16.259
- LIKE AN ASS[bleep].

27:31.524 --> 27:35.153
- TODAY, YOU HAD TO TATTOO
THE ULTIMATE TEST OF PRECISION,

27:35.236 --> 27:36.905
A PORTRAIT.

27:36.988 --> 27:38.156
EACH OF YOU
TATTOOED HEAD-TO-HEAD

27:38.239 --> 27:39.991
WITH ANOTHER ARTIST,

27:40.075 --> 27:43.328
AND WE WILL DIRECTLY
COMPARE YOUR WORK.

27:43.411 --> 27:45.955
MARK, LET'S START WITH YOU.

27:46.039 --> 27:48.166
YOU WENT UP AGAINST ERIK.

27:48.249 --> 27:50.168
- OUT OF EVERYTHING
I'VE SEEN YOU DO,

27:50.251 --> 27:52.420
THIS IS THE MOST PRECISION
I'VE SEEN YOU EXECUTE.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.464
REALLY NICE DETAILS
IN THE MOUTH.

27:54.547 --> 27:56.424
THE REALLY LIGHT SHADES
AND THE LITTLE HIGHLIGHTS

27:56.508 --> 27:58.176
THAT YOU DID IN THE WRINKLES
OF THE LIPS

27:58.259 --> 27:59.928
REALLY MAKE THE TATTOO
LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

28:00.011 --> 28:01.888
AND THIS IS A BIG COMEBACK
FOR YOU.

28:01.971 --> 28:05.892
SOAK IT IN AND KEEP TRYING
TO RIDE THE WAVE.

28:05.975 --> 28:10.230
- ERIK.

28:10.313 --> 28:12.440
- THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL
ON THE EYES IS NICE.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.526
THE EYES ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT
PART OF THE ENTIRE FACE.

28:14.776 --> 28:15.777
BUT THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS
THAT ARE CHANGED,

28:15.860 --> 28:17.821
LIKE THE NOSE,

28:17.904 --> 28:19.572
YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE NOSTRIL,

28:19.656 --> 28:21.449
AND IN THE PHOTOGRAPH,
YOU CAN'T.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.618
SO IT ALMOST TILTS THE FACE
IN ONE ASPECT,

28:23.701 --> 28:25.537
BUT THEN EVERYTHING ELSE
IS THE SAME.

28:25.620 --> 28:26.871
- THAT'S HOW IT WAS
IN THE PHOTOGRAPH

28:26.955 --> 28:28.832
WHEN I PUMPED UP THE CONTRAST.

28:28.915 --> 28:30.792
- YOU ALTERED DETAILS
WHICH CHANGED THE SHAPE

28:30.875 --> 28:32.544
OF THIS LADY'S FACE.

28:32.836 --> 28:35.171
THAT BOTTOM LIP
IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SHAPE

28:35.255 --> 28:37.340
THAN WHAT IT IS IN THE PHOTO.

28:37.424 --> 28:39.342
AS FAR AS PRECISION GOES,
YOU MISSED THE MARK ON THAT.

28:42.470 --> 28:44.222
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
BETWEEN MARK AND ERIK,

28:44.305 --> 28:45.932
WHO WINS
THE HEAD-TO-HEAD COMPETITION?

28:46.015 --> 28:47.600
{\an8}- MARK CAPTURED THE LIKENESS.

28:47.684 --> 28:49.185
{\an8}IT LOOKS LIKE HER.

28:49.269 --> 28:50.562
{\an8}THE PROPORTIONS
ARE TOTALLY CORRECT.

28:50.812 --> 28:52.480
{\an8}- FINAL ANSWER?
- I'M GONNA GO WITH MARK.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.149
- MARK.

28:54.232 --> 28:56.192
- MARK.
- MARK.

28:56.276 --> 28:59.446
- THE WINNER OF THE HEAD-TO-HEAD
CHALLENGE IS MARK.

28:59.529 --> 29:02.657
CLEEN, YOU WENT HEAD-TO-HEAD
WITH JASON.

29:02.907 --> 29:05.910
- YOU [bleep] KILLED IT
ON THE DETAILS ON THE HAT

29:05.994 --> 29:07.829
AND THE JACKET AND THE EMBLEMS.

29:07.912 --> 29:09.581
THE LITTLE HIGHLIGHTS
ON THE U.S. SYMBOLS

29:09.664 --> 29:11.624
ON HIS LAPEL IS JUST GREAT.

29:11.708 --> 29:14.210
FOR A PRECISION CHALLENGE,
I THINK YOU NAILED IT.

29:14.294 --> 29:16.588
- YOU EVEN ADDED A HIGHLIGHT

29:16.671 --> 29:19.007
TO THE TIE
WHICH ISN'T SHOWN IN THE PHOTO,

29:19.090 --> 29:21.551
AND THAT, I REALLY LIKED
BECAUSE THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS

29:21.634 --> 29:23.261
YOU CAN MAKE BETTER
IN A PORTRAIT,

29:23.344 --> 29:25.346
AND YOU DID THAT.
- YOU EXCELLED.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.599
IT WAS JUST DONE NICELY
AND SHARP AND METICULOUSLY.

29:27.849 --> 29:31.603
THAT'S WHAT WINS
THIS COMPETITION.

29:31.686 --> 29:31.936
- JASON.

29:36.274 --> 29:38.651
- YOU DID DO SOME NICE DETAILS
IN THE JACKET,

29:38.735 --> 29:40.653
BUT FOR THE PRECISION CHALLENGE,

29:40.737 --> 29:42.447
YOU MISSED A COUPLE
OF KEY SHAPES IN THE FACE.

29:42.530 --> 29:44.199
THE MOUTH IN THE PORTRAIT
KIND OF HAS A SHAPE

29:44.282 --> 29:45.867
LIKE YOURS DOES RIGHT NOW.

29:45.950 --> 29:48.119
- THAT PISSED OFF SHAPE?
- YEAH.

29:48.203 --> 29:50.205
IT HAS THAT LITTLE CURL TO IT,
AND YOURS IS PRETTY STRAIGHT,

29:50.288 --> 29:52.707
AND IT REALLY CHANGES
THE EXPRESSION IN THE FACE.

29:52.790 --> 29:54.542
- IF YOU LOOK IN THE PHOTO,

29:54.626 --> 29:56.461
THE CONTRAST
BETWEEN HOW DARK THE HAT IS

29:56.544 --> 29:59.172
AND HOW DARK HIS SKIN IS
IS DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT.

29:59.255 --> 30:00.924
REALLY DARK IN THE FACE

30:01.007 --> 30:03.009
AND MISSING THE SHAPE
OF HIS MOUTH

30:03.092 --> 30:07.430
IS WHAT TAKES IT AWAY
FROM LOOKING LIKE THIS GUY.

30:07.514 --> 30:08.473
- WHO WINS
THE HEAD-TO-HEAD COMPETITION

30:08.556 --> 30:11.059
BETWEEN CLEEN AND JASON?

30:11.142 --> 30:13.686
{\an8}- THERE'S NO MISTAKING
THE DIFFERENCE IN THE QUALITY

30:13.770 --> 30:16.397
{\an8}OF HOW SMOOTH
AND HOW NICE CLEEN'S IS.

30:16.481 --> 30:17.774
- FINAL DECISION.
- CLEEN.

30:17.857 --> 30:19.400
- MY PICK IS CLEEN.

30:19.484 --> 30:21.528
- CLEEN.
- CLEEN.

30:21.611 --> 30:23.696
- THE WINNER OF THE HEAD-TO-HEAD
COMPETITION IS CLEEN.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.573
CONGRATULATIONS.
- THANK YOU.

30:25.657 --> 30:29.327
- CRIS, YOU WENT HEAD-TO-HEAD
WITH AARON.

30:29.410 --> 30:32.330
- MY BIG PROBLEM
WITH THIS TATTOO IS YOU MADE UP

30:32.413 --> 30:34.707
A BUNCH OF HIGHLIGHTS
THAT DON'T EXIST IN THE PHOTO.

30:34.791 --> 30:36.501
ON HER NECK UNDERNEATH HER CHIN,
YOU JUST MADE UP

30:36.584 --> 30:39.003
A COMPLETE WHITE HIGHLIGHT
THAT DOESN'T EXIST.

30:39.087 --> 30:41.506
IT REALLY DOES CHANGE THE SHAPE
OF THIS GIRL'S FACE A LOT,

30:41.589 --> 30:44.509
AND THEN YOU REALLY
WENT GRAPHIC WITH IT.

30:44.592 --> 30:47.637
YOU EXAGGERATED THE LINES
IN HER CREASES IN HER MOUTH.

30:47.720 --> 30:50.431
IN THE PHOTO,
SHE LOOKS REAL SOFT AND ROUND,

30:50.515 --> 30:52.100
AND YOU PUT A LOT
OF HARD EDGES ON HER.

30:52.183 --> 30:55.103
THAT HURTS YOU
ON PRECISION DAY.

30:55.186 --> 30:59.023
- AARON.

30:59.107 --> 31:00.817
- I THINK THE FIRST THING
THAT I NOTICED ON THIS

31:00.900 --> 31:02.694
IS THAT DROOPY EYE.

31:02.777 --> 31:04.737
ON THE RIGHT,
IT SAGS A LITTLE BIT.

31:04.821 --> 31:06.781
I THINK THAT THROWS THINGS
COMPLETELY OFF.

31:06.864 --> 31:08.866
- ANOTHER PLACE
THAT THE PRECISION IS NOT THERE

31:08.950 --> 31:10.285
IS IN THE MOUTH.

31:10.368 --> 31:12.620
THOSE LIPS ARE NOT HER LIPS,

31:12.704 --> 31:15.039
AND THEN THE REALLY DARK
YOU DID IN THE GUMS--

31:15.123 --> 31:17.250
IT MAKES IT ALMOST LOOK LIKE
SHE'S MISSING TEETH.

31:17.333 --> 31:20.461
THE TRANSLATION
FROM THE PHOTO TO THE SKIN

31:20.545 --> 31:23.506
IS WHERE THE PRECISION
HAS TO BE 100%,

31:23.590 --> 31:26.092
AND A PORTRAIT
IS VERY UNFORGIVING.

31:26.175 --> 31:27.510
- PORTRAIT KING
JUST GOT DECROWNED.

31:31.681 --> 31:33.850
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS, SO WHO WINS
THE HEAD-TO-HEAD COMPETITION

31:33.933 --> 31:35.602
BETWEEN CRIS AND AARON?

31:35.685 --> 31:37.312
{\an8}- THIS IS KIND OF
A TOUGH ONE FOR ME.

31:37.395 --> 31:40.023
{\an8}CRIS, I THINK THAT YOURS
IS ACTUALLY OVERPRECISE.

31:40.106 --> 31:41.816
{\an8}THE HARD LINES KIND OF TAKE AWAY

31:41.899 --> 31:45.028
{\an8}FROM ANY SOFTNESS
THAT A PORTRAIT MIGHT HAVE.

31:45.111 --> 31:47.655
- AARON'S LOOKS
MORE LIKE A LITTLE GIRL TO ME.

31:47.739 --> 31:51.242
- I LITERALLY FIND ENOUGH THINGS

31:51.326 --> 31:53.286
IN BOTH THAT ARE BAD
THAT I DON'T HAVE A CLEAR WINNER

31:53.369 --> 31:56.581
OR A CLEAR LOSER.

31:56.664 --> 31:57.790
- JUST JUDGE EACH SECTION.

31:57.874 --> 31:59.167
{\an8}JUST JUDGE THE MOUTH.

31:59.250 --> 32:00.752
{\an8}- CRIS GOT IT.
- CRIS GOT IT.

32:00.835 --> 32:02.837
{\an8}- NOW JUST JUDGE THE EYES.
- DEBATABLE.

32:02.920 --> 32:04.547
{\an8}- JUST JUDGE THE HAIR NOW.
- AARON.

32:04.631 --> 32:06.341
{\an8}- AARON GOT IT.
- JUST JUDGE THE CHIN.

32:06.424 --> 32:07.592
{\an8}- CRIS GOT IT.
- CRIS GOT IT.

32:07.675 --> 32:08.843
{\an8}- NOW JUST JUDGE THE CHEEKS.

32:08.926 --> 32:10.970
{\an8}- AARON GOT IT.
- AARON.

32:11.054 --> 32:12.639
- GUYS, I'M OUT.

32:12.722 --> 32:14.807
I'M NOT PICKING A WINNER.
- FLIP A COIN.

32:14.891 --> 32:16.517
- WE DON'T FLIP COINS
IN THIS THING.

32:16.601 --> 32:18.603
- OKAY, NO,
I'M JUST SAYING, THEN.

32:18.686 --> 32:20.647
- THE FAIREST THING
THAT I CAN SAY TO BOTH OF YOU

32:20.730 --> 32:22.649
IS THAT I DON'T SEE
EITHER ONE BEING A LANDSLIDE

32:22.732 --> 32:23.691
TO THE PLUS OR THE MINUS.
- I AGREE WITH THAT.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.319
NO WINNER.

32:26.402 --> 32:28.404
- ALL RIGHT.

32:28.488 --> 32:31.824
FOR THIS HEAD-TO-HEAD CHALLENGE,
THERE IS NO WINNER.

32:31.908 --> 32:35.078
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
IS DELIBERATING RIGHT NOW,

32:35.161 --> 32:37.622
AND THEIR VOTE WILL PUT
ONE ARTIST UP FOR ELIMINATION.

32:37.705 --> 32:39.874
HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT.

32:39.957 --> 32:41.459
WE'LL CALL YOU BACK
WHEN WE HAVE A DECISION.

32:45.004 --> 32:46.881
- ONE OF US IS GOING HOME.

32:46.964 --> 32:48.800
ONE OF US IS PACKING OUR [bleep]
AND GOING HOME.

32:49.092 --> 32:51.094
- I'LL BE [bleep] LIVID
IF I GO HOME BEFORE YOU GUYS.

32:51.177 --> 32:52.887
I'LL GO DOWN THERE,
BUT I'M NOT [bleep] GOING HOME.

32:52.970 --> 32:54.806
I THINK
YOU SHOULD BE GOING HOME,

32:54.889 --> 32:56.641
I THINK YOU SHOULD BE
GOING HOME,

32:56.724 --> 32:58.434
AND I THINK
CRIS SHOULD BE GOING HOME.

32:58.518 --> 33:00.645
- WELL, YOU CAN KISS MY ASS,
'CAUSE--

33:00.728 --> 33:02.063
- BULL[bleep], DUDE. HOW MANY
TIMES YOU BEEN DOWN THERE?

33:02.146 --> 33:03.731
- ONCE.
- EXA--ONCE?

33:03.981 --> 33:05.316
- ONE TIME,
AND YOUR WEIRD-ASS TATTOOS

33:05.400 --> 33:07.402
HAVE PUT YOU DOWN THERE TWICE.

33:07.485 --> 33:08.945
YOU INTENTIONALLY MADE IT LOOK
LESS LIKE THE PERSON.

33:09.028 --> 33:10.655
THAT DOESN'T
MAKE IT RIGHT.

33:10.738 --> 33:12.740
- NO, I MADE IT LOOK
JUST LIKE THE PERSON.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.909
I DON'T GIVE A [bleep]
WHAT ANYBODY SAYS.

33:14.992 --> 33:16.828
I'M NOT BACKING DOWN,
AND I'M NOT GOING HOME TODAY.

33:17.078 --> 33:18.871
- THERE'S SIX OF US LEFT,
AND SOMEBODY'S GONNA LEAVE.

33:18.955 --> 33:19.872
- IT AIN'T GONNA BE ME.
[bleep] THAT.

33:20.123 --> 33:21.916
- I KNOW FOR A FACT

33:22.166 --> 33:23.334
THAT IF I GOT YOUR TATTOO,
I WOULD HAVE KILLED IT.

33:23.418 --> 33:24.627
- [bleep] THAT, MAN.

33:24.711 --> 33:26.504
- I, FROM THE GET-GO,

33:26.587 --> 33:28.548
DIDN'T LIKE EITHER ONE
OF YOU GUYS' TATTOOS

33:28.631 --> 33:30.133
BECAUSE YOUR STYLISTIC
APPROACHES CHANGED THE LOOK

33:30.216 --> 33:32.218
OF THE SUBJECT--
THAT'S IT.

33:32.301 --> 33:34.220
- JUST GET OVER THAT ALREADY.
- THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

33:34.303 --> 33:36.305
- I DON'T GIVE A [bleep]
IF YOU LIKED IT OR NOT.

33:36.389 --> 33:38.516
YOU'RE NOT THE [bleep] JUDGE.
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

33:38.599 --> 33:40.476
IT'S A PRECISION CHALLENGE,
AND YOU BOTH [bleep] IT UP.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.478
- YOU'RE NOT THE JUDGE.
I DON'T GIVE A [bleep].

33:42.562 --> 33:44.230
- NO, PRECISION--
I NAILED THE [bleep] PRECISION

33:44.313 --> 33:45.940
BECAUSE I HAD
TOO MUCH PRECISION.

33:46.023 --> 33:48.192
- THAT'S FINE.
YOU KNOW WHAT, THOUGH?

33:48.276 --> 33:49.777
IF EITHER ONE OF YOU [bleep]
PIECES OF [bleep] HAD MY CANVAS,

33:49.861 --> 33:51.279
IT'D HAVE BEEN A [bleep] TURD.
- OOH.

33:51.362 --> 33:53.197
- THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL,

33:53.281 --> 33:54.866
'CAUSE YOU [bleep] UP
ON YOUR LIGHT SKIN,

33:55.116 --> 33:56.951
AND YOU [bleep] UP
ON YOUR LIGHT SKIN.

33:57.201 --> 34:04.751
IF EITHER ONE OF YOU HAD MINE,
YOU'D HAVE BEEN GONE.

34:04.834 --> 34:07.378
- SO TODAY WE'RE TESTING
PRECISION WITH PORTRAITS.

34:07.462 --> 34:09.213
LET'S START WITH ERIK.

34:09.297 --> 34:10.757
- I HAVE MASSIVE PROBLEMS
WITH THE HAIR.

34:10.840 --> 34:13.259
USING A LOT OF BLACK IS GOOD.

34:13.342 --> 34:15.762
USING TOO MUCH BLACK
IS EXTREMELY BAD,

34:15.844 --> 34:17.889
AND I THINK
HE CROSSED THAT LINE.

34:17.972 --> 34:19.806
- WHERE HE REALLY FELL APART
FOR ME IS THE PRECISION,

34:20.056 --> 34:22.018
THE PRECISION IN THE LIPS,

34:22.101 --> 34:24.270
THE PRECISION IN THE SHAPE
OF THE CAP IN THE BACK.

34:24.353 --> 34:27.356
{\an1}HE CREATED SHAPES IN THE SHADING
THAT DON'T EXIST IN THE PHOTO.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.817
- I WOULD SAY IT'S TERRIBLE.

34:29.900 --> 34:32.445
- LET'S MOVE ALONG
TO AARON AND CRIS.

34:32.527 --> 34:34.530
{\an8}WE WERE UNABLE
TO MAKE A DECISION.

34:34.614 --> 34:36.866
{\an8}- AARON'S PORTRAIT
LOOKS LIKE HE TOOK THE PHOTO

34:36.949 --> 34:39.368
{\an8}AND RAN IT THROUGH
THE XEROX MACHINE TEN TIMES.

34:39.452 --> 34:40.953
- HE WASN'T PRECISE
WITH THE DETAILS.

34:41.036 --> 34:41.871
HE LOST IT ON THE EYE.

34:42.121 --> 34:43.706
HE LOST IT ON THE MOUTH.

34:43.790 --> 34:45.500
HE LOST IT.
- YEAH.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.585
- THE MORE THAT I LOOK
AT CRIS' TATTOO,

34:47.668 --> 34:50.295
THE STRANGER IT BECOMES TO ME
IN THE SHADING

34:50.379 --> 34:51.839
AND THE WAY
THAT HE EXECUTED IT.

34:51.922 --> 34:53.800
- IT'S HARD TO LOOK AT.

34:53.882 --> 34:55.927
THOSE HARD LINES
GIVE IT THAT 16-YEAR-OLD LOOK.

34:56.010 --> 34:57.845
IT'S JUST NOT A STRONG PORTRAIT.

34:57.929 --> 35:00.389
- IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE
A LITTLE GIRL.

35:00.473 --> 35:03.851
{\an1}- IF THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY VOTES
FOR ONE OF THESE TWO PORTRAITS

35:03.935 --> 35:05.853
TO BE DOWN AT THE BOTTOM
AS WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY,

35:05.937 --> 35:07.605
IS THAT GONNA HELP
SWAY OUR DECISION HERE?

35:07.688 --> 35:08.940
- IT DEFINITELY COULD.

35:09.023 --> 35:11.567
- THIS IS A TOUGH ONE.

35:11.651 --> 35:15.279
{\an8}- WE'RE HERE TO DETERMINE WHO
HAD THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

35:15.363 --> 35:18.407
- THAT IS MY TATTOO,
AND MY ARTIST WAS ERIK.

35:18.491 --> 35:20.368
- THE THING
THAT GETS ME IS THE DARK SHADOW

35:20.451 --> 35:21.786
HE PUT ON HER CHEEK,

35:21.869 --> 35:23.037
IT'S NOT ENOUGH DETAIL,

35:23.120 --> 35:24.956
AND THE HAIR IS JUST TOO FLAT.

35:25.039 --> 35:29.085
- AND THE PICTURE
LOOKED MORE ALIVE.

35:29.168 --> 35:30.670
- THIS IS MY TATTOO,

35:30.753 --> 35:32.964
AND MY ARTIST WAS AARON.

35:33.047 --> 35:34.966
- IT LOOKS MORE LIKE MY SISTER.

35:35.049 --> 35:36.884
LIKE, I CAN'T SEE MYSELF AT ALL
IN THAT PICTURE.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.886
- IT'S ACTUALLY THE EYES
AND THE NOSE.

35:39.136 --> 35:40.471
- MM-HMM.
- IT'S THE SLIGHT DIFFERENCE

35:40.555 --> 35:41.931
THAT HE DIDN'T CATCH RIGHT.

35:42.014 --> 35:43.683
- YEAH, 'CAUSE MY SISTER'S NOSE,

35:43.766 --> 35:44.934
IT NEEDED TO BE
A LITTLE MORE ROUNDER,

35:45.017 --> 35:46.978
AND IT'S KIND OF JUST THERE.

35:47.061 --> 35:49.063
- HE DIDN'T DO THIS VERY WELL.

35:49.146 --> 35:50.982
- I LIKE THE TATTOO,

35:51.232 --> 35:56.279
I JUST THINK THAT IT
DOES NOT LOOK LIKE MY DAUGHTER.

35:56.362 --> 35:57.530
- THAT'S MY TATTOO.

35:57.613 --> 35:59.615
MY ARTIST WAS CRIS.

35:59.699 --> 36:01.158
- THE LIGHT'S DIFFERENT
ON THE LEFT SIDE THAN IT IS

36:01.242 --> 36:02.910
ON THE RIGHT SIDE.
- YEAH.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.037
- AND THE LINES
AROUND THE MOUTH, IT'S OFF.

36:05.121 --> 36:06.873
LIKE, ONE'S HIGHER
THAN THE OTHER.

36:07.164 --> 36:09.000
- YEAH, ONE'S MORE ROUND, WHILE
ANOTHER ONE LOOKS LIKE THE LINE

36:09.083 --> 36:10.835
JUST WENT STRAIGHT DOWN.
- YEAH.

36:10.918 --> 36:12.753
- WE'RE AT THIS POINT
OF THE CHALLENGE

36:12.837 --> 36:14.505
WHERE ANY LITTLE THING
NEEDS TO BE ON POINT.

36:14.589 --> 36:15.631
- MM-HMM.
- DO WE HAVE A DECISION?

36:15.715 --> 36:18.968
all: YES.

36:19.051 --> 36:21.053
- I DON'T THINK MY PORTRAIT
WAS THAT BAD,

36:21.137 --> 36:25.016
CONSIDERING SOME OF
THE OTHER PORTRAITS THAT I SAW.

36:25.266 --> 36:26.934
- THERE'S NO GUARANTEES.
WE'VE SEEN THAT SO FAR.

36:32.940 --> 36:34.025
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

36:34.275 --> 36:37.737
THE ARTISTS IN THE BOTTOM...

36:37.820 --> 36:40.323
ARE ERIK...

36:40.406 --> 36:43.451
AARON...

36:43.534 --> 36:45.703
AND CRIS.

36:45.786 --> 36:47.914
WE'LL SEE ALL OF YOU DOWNSTAIRS.

36:51.459 --> 36:53.377
- YOU READY?
- LET'S GO.

37:03.054 --> 37:05.932
- TODAY, YOU WENT HEAD-TO-HEAD
TATTOOING PORTRAITS.

37:06.015 --> 37:09.352
CRIS, AARON, AND ERIK,

37:09.435 --> 37:14.774
YOUR SPOT
IN THIS COMPETITION IS AT RISK.

37:14.857 --> 37:18.069
CRIS, YOU'RE HERE
BECAUSE THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY

37:18.152 --> 37:21.447
DETERMINED THAT YOU HAD
THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

37:21.530 --> 37:24.492
- I JUST TRIED TO DO
A REALLY CLEAN, SOLID TATTOO.

37:24.575 --> 37:27.453
- THESE MADE-UP HIGHLIGHTS
CHANGED THOSE CONTOURS,

37:27.536 --> 37:29.163
AND YOU DID PUT A FEW YEARS
ON HER.

37:29.246 --> 37:31.123
- I'M JUST DISAPPOINTED
IN MYSELF

37:31.207 --> 37:33.000
JUST BEING DOWN HERE
SO MANY TIMES.

37:33.084 --> 37:34.418
- UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN YOU HAVE
THAT MANY POOR OUTINGS,

37:34.502 --> 37:36.754
THEY CATCH UP.

37:36.837 --> 37:38.631
- AARON.

37:38.714 --> 37:40.466
- I DON'T FEEL
THIS IS A VERY PRECISE TATTOO.

37:40.549 --> 37:42.718
IT LOOKS REALLY RUSHED.

37:42.802 --> 37:44.553
- IT WAS METICULOUS AND TEDIOUS,
AND I SPENT A LOT OF TIME--

37:44.637 --> 37:46.764
- THERE'S NOTHING
THAT LOOKS METICULOUS.

37:46.847 --> 37:48.599
- THIS IS KILLING ME BECAUSE
I SPECIALIZE IN PORTRAIT WORK,

37:48.683 --> 37:50.935
AND I'M EMBARRASSED AND ASHAMED

37:51.018 --> 37:53.062
I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE RIGHT
NOW, BUT I ATTEMPTED TO MAKE

37:53.312 --> 37:57.608
MY TATTOO LOOK LIKE THE SUBJECT,
NOT A CARTOON VERSION OF IT.

37:57.692 --> 37:58.985
I'M NOT TRYING TO DOG ON YOUR
TATTOO,

37:59.068 --> 38:00.820
BUT IF YOU CHANGE FEATURES

38:00.903 --> 38:02.863
AND MAKE THEM
LOOK LIKE SOMEBODY ELSE,

38:02.947 --> 38:04.615
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW THAT QUALIFIES AS PRECISION.

38:04.699 --> 38:06.659
- YOU CHANGED DETAILS, TOO.
- YEAH.

38:06.742 --> 38:07.910
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- WHAT DID I CHANGE?

38:07.994 --> 38:08.911
I--I FLUFFED THE CHIN.

38:08.995 --> 38:10.705
{\an8}- AND THE TEETH.

38:10.788 --> 38:12.540
{\an8}- AS FAR AS CAPTURING
THE LIKENESS OF THIS YOUNG GIRL,

38:12.623 --> 38:14.667
{\an8}Y'ALL BOTH MISSED THE MARK.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.921
- ERIK.

38:19.005 --> 38:22.133
- I'M JUST A REAL STICKLER
ON VERY SPECIFIC FUNDAMENTALS

38:22.216 --> 38:24.051
OF TATTOOING,

38:24.135 --> 38:26.929
AND THE LINES UP TOP AT
THE FILIGREE WERE A BIT SLOPPY.

38:27.013 --> 38:29.682
- I'VE BUSTED MY HUMP THIS WHOLE
TIME DOING GREAT TATTOOS.

38:29.765 --> 38:31.726
THERE'S PEOPLE STANDING NEXT TO
ME THAT HAVE BEEN AT THE BOTTOM

38:31.809 --> 38:34.270
SO MANY DAMN TIMES,
AND THEN I'VE HAD ONE BAD DAY.

38:34.353 --> 38:36.147
I BASICALLY DON'T THINK
I DESERVE TO GO HOME.

38:36.397 --> 38:38.190
- YOU'RE GOING UP
AGAINST FEWER AND FEWER PEOPLE.

38:38.274 --> 38:40.151
IF YOU DO A BAD TATTOO,

38:40.234 --> 38:44.071
YOUR REPORT CARD
CAN ONLY SAVE YOU SO MUCH.

38:44.155 --> 38:46.866
- WHO GOES HOME?

38:46.949 --> 38:49.535
- JUST LOOKING
BETWEEN AARON AND CRIS,

38:49.618 --> 38:51.954
THERE'S PLENTY OF ARGUMENT
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE FENCE.

38:52.038 --> 38:53.664
{\an8}- LET'S TALK IT OUT.

38:53.748 --> 38:57.960
{\an8}- ON FIRST GLANCE,
AARON'S LOOKS MORE PHOTOGRAPHIC.

38:58.044 --> 39:00.379
{\an8}- IF I WERE TO JUDGE
ON PRECISION TODAY,

39:00.463 --> 39:04.133
{\an8}I WOULD PICK CRIS' TATTOO
OVER AARON'S.

39:04.216 --> 39:05.259
- I UNDERSTAND
THAT THE CHALLENGE OF THE DAY

39:05.509 --> 39:07.970
IS PRECISION, BUT AS A CLIENT,

39:08.054 --> 39:09.930
I'M NOT GOING TO MY FRIENDS,

39:10.014 --> 39:11.599
"HEY, CHECK OUT THE PRECISION
IN THIS PIECE."

39:11.682 --> 39:13.476
- BUT IT'S HARD FOR ME
TO PASS UP

39:13.559 --> 39:18.147
HOW TECHNICALLY SMOOTH
CRIS' ABILITIES ARE.

39:18.230 --> 39:20.232
- I'VE SEEN MORE VERSATILITY
FROM CRIS

39:20.316 --> 39:22.193
THAN I HAVE OUT OF AARON.
- CRIS?

39:22.276 --> 39:23.944
- YEAH.
- THE GUY WHO SAID HE GAVE UP

39:24.028 --> 39:24.904
BEFORE HE GOT STARTED
ON A TATTOO?

39:24.987 --> 39:27.198
REALLY?

39:27.281 --> 39:30.284
WE'RE OBVIOUSLY
VERY SPLIT HERE.

39:30.367 --> 39:33.996
FINAL DECISIONS.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.456
MY VOTE IS FOR CRIS TO GO.

39:35.539 --> 39:37.208
- I'M GONNA SAY AARON.

39:37.291 --> 39:40.127
- AARON.
- AARON.

39:40.211 --> 39:42.254
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

39:42.338 --> 39:45.216
AARON, YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE INK MASTER.

39:45.299 --> 39:47.051
- CHOICES WERE JUST OFF,

39:47.134 --> 39:49.011
AND IF YOU WOULD HAVE HIT
ONE OR TWO CHOICES RIGHT,

39:49.095 --> 39:51.388
THIS WOULD NOT BE THIS DECISION.

39:51.472 --> 39:53.474
- PLEASE PACK YOUR MACHINES
AND CLOSE SHOP.

39:58.813 --> 40:01.273
- THIS IS NOT MY TIME TO GO.

40:01.357 --> 40:03.192
THIS IS BULL[bleep].
I GOT SENT HOME ON A PORTRAIT.

40:03.275 --> 40:05.611
THIS IS EVEN BIGGER BULL[bleep]

40:05.694 --> 40:08.155
THAT CRIS IS STILL HERE
WITH THE [bleep]-ASS TATTOO

40:08.239 --> 40:10.157
THAT HE DID.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.159
THIS IS ALL WRONG.

40:12.243 --> 40:13.369
THIS CANNOT BE
HAPPENING TO ME RIGHT NOW.

40:20.167 --> 40:22.086
announcer: ON THE NEXT EPISODE
OF <i> INK MASTER...</i>

40:22.169 --> 40:26.632
- WE'VE ASSEMBLED A VERY SPECIAL
PANEL OF GUEST JUDGES,

40:26.715 --> 40:28.759
AND YOU SHOULD BE FREAKED OUT.

40:28.843 --> 40:30.719
- THIS TATTOO'S GONNA
BE THE DEATH OF ONE OF YOU.

40:30.803 --> 40:32.596
- YOU TWO ARE
ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK RIGHT NOW.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.682
- THIS IS ALSO
A MENTAL MIND[bleep], MAN.

40:34.765 --> 40:36.851
- BUT A MASTER
WOULD NEVER DOUBT THEMSELVES.

40:36.934 --> 40:38.894
- YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE I HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BEAT YOU?

40:38.978 --> 40:41.063
- SUN SHINES IN A DOG'S ASS
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

40:41.147 --> 40:42.982
- IT'S GONNA GET
PRETTY ROUGH TODAY.

40:43.065 --> 40:44.775
I WOULDN'T WANT
TO BE IN YOUR SHOES RIGHT NOW.

40:44.859 --> 40:46.152
- I'VE GIVEN YOU EVERY SHOVE
I COULD.

40:46.235 --> 40:47.153
I CAN'T STAND THIS TATTOO.

40:47.444 --> 40:49.196
- IT LOOKS LIKE A CHILD DRAWING.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.948
- I'D RATHER YOU COME UP
AND KICK ME

40:51.031 --> 40:52.199
IN THE BALLS
THAN SAY THAT.

40:52.283 --> 40:53.576
- YOU DROPPED IT ON THIS ONE.

40:53.659 --> 40:53.868
- HOWEVER, THERE IS A TWIST.
