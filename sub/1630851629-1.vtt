WEBVTT

01:04.147 --> 01:05.940
Doctor, get back in the car!

01:05.982 --> 01:07.776
No! No.

01:07.817 --> 01:10.153
I'm still gonna blow
this motherfucker's brains out.

01:11.529 --> 01:14.199
-Mom! Mom!

01:14.240 --> 01:16.242
Help!

01:25.543 --> 01:27.837
-Pick up.

01:29.005 --> 01:30.548
Pick up.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.134
Dude, where are you?

01:33.176 --> 01:34.469
OSCAR
Hey there, sassy lovers.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.137
-This is Oscar.
-Damn it.

01:36.179 --> 01:37.806
I am unable to take
your call right now

01:37.847 --> 01:39.349
because I'm standing right...

01:39.391 --> 01:40.809
-behind you!

01:40.850 --> 01:44.062
Hey, Oscar, uh, call me
wh-when you get this.

01:44.104 --> 01:47.524
Um, I messed up
with Allyson, man.

01:47.565 --> 01:50.151
I got to find her and, uh,
fix it somehow,

01:50.193 --> 01:52.612
so, uh, if you know where she is

01:52.654 --> 01:55.365
or if you guys are together,
let me know.

01:55.407 --> 01:58.410
All right. Be safe. Bye.

02:02.038 --> 02:03.957
Damn it!

02:10.213 --> 02:12.465
Dude, you okay?

02:14.175 --> 02:16.386
Hey! You okay?

02:18.555 --> 02:20.265
Hey.

02:22.392 --> 02:25.228
Hey, man, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

02:26.021 --> 02:27.063
Oh, no.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.065
Oh, my God. Okay.

02:29.107 --> 02:32.235
Okay.

02:32.277 --> 02:35.071
Help! Help!

02:35.113 --> 02:37.157
Oh, shit. Help!

02:37.198 --> 02:39.034
Somebody help!

02:39.075 --> 02:40.535
Okay, okay.

02:40.577 --> 02:41.661
All right.

02:41.703 --> 02:45.040
All right.
Um, okay, okay, okay.

02:47.792 --> 02:48.918
Okay. All right, man.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.879
Come on. Come on,
look at me, look at me.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.172
Stay with me, stay with me.

02:52.213 --> 02:53.548
Hawkins, Officer Hawkins.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.717
Okay. Look at me, look at me.
You're good.

02:55.759 --> 02:58.303
Hold on tight.
I'm gonna get help, okay?

02:58.345 --> 03:00.764
-Help! Help!
-He needs to die.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.391
He needs to die.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.268
Okay, okay.
Come on, come on.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.644
Stay still, stay still,
stay still. Look at me.

03:06.686 --> 03:08.229
-Look at... Look at me.
-He needs to die.

03:08.271 --> 03:09.647
Who needs to die?

03:09.689 --> 03:11.775
He needs to die.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.485
And I'm the one...

03:13.526 --> 03:15.695
that's gonna get him.

03:21.284 --> 03:23.495
Oh, shit.

03:24.579 --> 03:26.247
Haddonfield
Sheriff's Department.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.458
Stop right there.

03:32.796 --> 03:34.631
I said stop!

03:45.600 --> 03:47.310
Shit.

03:49.854 --> 03:51.648
Shit.

04:04.703 --> 04:07.580
-Hawkins! You all right?

04:07.622 --> 04:08.832
-Did you see him?

04:08.873 --> 04:10.709
-Where did he go?
-Where have you guys been?

04:10.750 --> 04:12.252
I called for backup
ten minutes ago.

04:12.293 --> 04:13.795
Easy, rookie.

04:13.837 --> 04:15.630
Loomis said he shot him
multiple times in the chest.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.132
I saw from 50 yards away.

04:17.173 --> 04:20.385
He crossed right here
and then just disappeared.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.178
Okay. Sullivan, you and Tobias

04:22.220 --> 04:23.722
search Chestnut,
south to the bypass.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.849
Hawkins and I will track
Market Street up to Lampkin.

04:25.890 --> 04:26.891
We'll catch him.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.977
Yeah, kill the bad guy.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.563
Jesus, Frank.

04:31.604 --> 04:33.440
I used to know the guy.

04:33.481 --> 04:35.650
-Michael. We were kids.
-Yeah?

04:35.692 --> 04:37.819
Was he one of those
weirdo freaks who used to pluck

04:37.861 --> 04:40.238
the wings off butterflies
when he was a kid?

04:40.280 --> 04:42.282
Not that I ever saw.

04:42.323 --> 04:43.992
He was just...

04:44.034 --> 04:46.161
Just killed his sister
when he was six years old?

04:46.202 --> 04:49.205
Yeah. My mom used to make me
go over to his house to play.

04:49.247 --> 04:51.708
She felt bad. But he would just
spend the whole time

04:51.750 --> 04:54.461
staring out of his sister's
bedroom window.

04:54.502 --> 04:56.504
I always remember thinking,

04:56.546 --> 04:59.007
"The hell is he looking at
out there?"

05:00.342 --> 05:02.510
He was looking at Haddonfield.

05:02.552 --> 05:05.847
Simple town where
nothing exciting ever happens.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.432
Yeah.

05:07.474 --> 05:10.393
Then one day, he just snapped.

05:18.985 --> 05:21.529
-Lonnie, Lonnie,
weird and scrawny. -

05:21.571 --> 05:24.199
Has bad dreams,
so cries to mommy.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.784
He's gonna get you.

05:25.825 --> 05:28.203
He's gonna get you, Lonnie.
He's gonna get you.

05:28.244 --> 05:29.496
Touch Conrad's candy again,

05:29.537 --> 05:30.955
I swear to God
I'll beat your ugly ass!

05:30.997 --> 05:32.207
Yeah, we'll beat your
ugly ass. That's right!

05:32.248 --> 05:33.708
I didn't do it. It wasn't me.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.418
-It was Richie.
-Then show me.

05:35.460 --> 05:36.920
Open your hand right now.

05:36.961 --> 05:38.463
-No. -Why don't you
open up your hand?

05:38.505 --> 05:39.756
I don't want to.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.218
-Get off.
-Open your hand!

05:44.427 --> 05:45.845
Leave me alone.

05:47.597 --> 05:48.932
Yeah, okay.

05:50.892 --> 05:53.520
That's what you get when
you fuck with the Mullanys.

05:53.561 --> 05:56.022
Get away from me!
Leave me alone!

05:58.692 --> 06:00.735
Hey. Everything all right
with you kids?

06:00.777 --> 06:03.488
Yeah. Just trick-or-treating
with our new old friend Lonnie.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.073
What? You...

06:05.115 --> 06:07.450
You kids see anyone
walking around in a white mask?

06:07.492 --> 06:09.828
It's Halloween.
Everyone's wearing a mask.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.955
That's right. I need you
to go home right now.

06:11.996 --> 06:14.416
Go home to your parents
and lock your doors.

06:14.457 --> 06:16.668
-Why? What did he do?
-What did he do?

06:16.710 --> 06:18.253
He murdered three teenagers
down the street.

06:23.967 --> 06:26.094
Don't get murdered, Lonnie.

06:26.136 --> 06:28.263
--Sleep with
one eye open, Lonnie.

06:28.304 --> 06:29.931
He's gonna get you, Lonnie Elam!

06:29.973 --> 06:32.100
-Boogey, Boogey.
-Did you see his face?

06:33.226 --> 06:36.354
Lonnie, Lonnie,
weird and scrawny.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.606
Has bad dreams,
so cries to mommy.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.233
Be careful, Lonnie.

06:40.275 --> 06:41.776
He's gonna get you,
Lonnie. He's gonna get you.

06:41.818 --> 06:43.278
He's gonna get you, Lonnie.

06:43.319 --> 06:44.988
Sleep with one eye open, Lonnie.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.781
He's gonna get you, Lonnie.

06:46.823 --> 06:49.034
He's gonna get you,
Lonnie Elam.

07:12.015 --> 07:13.475
Help.

07:13.516 --> 07:14.893
Help!

07:14.934 --> 07:17.604
I'm sorry
for tripping Tommy Doyle

07:17.645 --> 07:18.855
and bullying him.

07:18.897 --> 07:21.816
Just... just-just please
don't kill me.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.401
-Hey, kid. You okay?

07:23.443 --> 07:25.028
Hey, whoa. It's all right.
Take it easy.

07:25.070 --> 07:26.363
Where'd he go?

07:26.404 --> 07:27.614
Where is he?

07:27.655 --> 07:29.574
You-you didn't see him?

07:29.616 --> 07:32.118
-Take a deep breath.
-Who?

07:32.160 --> 07:34.162
The Boogeyman.

07:36.122 --> 07:37.499
-He's gonna kill you!
-Whoa. Hey, hey.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.501
-Boogeyman?
-What the hell?

07:39.542 --> 07:41.002
That's it.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.297
That's the Myers house.

07:44.339 --> 07:46.675
That's where it happened.

07:46.716 --> 07:49.844
Halloween, 1963.

08:19.874 --> 08:22.085
-Hey, Frank?

08:22.127 --> 08:23.586
Yeah.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.880
There's a dead dog in here.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.048
What?

08:27.090 --> 08:28.174
Nothing.

08:39.269 --> 08:41.563
Don't shoot!

08:41.604 --> 08:43.898
-Frank. Frank.
-What?

08:45.442 --> 08:47.318
Oh, sh...

08:49.279 --> 08:51.823
Go for it.

08:52.824 --> 08:55.952
PETE
Three, two, one.

08:59.164 --> 09:00.623
Okay.

09:00.665 --> 09:04.085
-Crazy.

09:10.967 --> 09:12.385
Ugh.

09:12.427 --> 09:13.970
Spiderwebs.

10:06.189 --> 10:07.899
Haddonfield.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.526
Where nothing exciting
ever happ...

10:15.031 --> 10:16.157
McCabe?

10:20.328 --> 10:22.330
McCabe?

10:22.372 --> 10:24.249
-McCabe!

10:28.545 --> 10:29.838
Drop him!

10:29.879 --> 10:31.423
Drop him or I'll shoot.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.134
Michael, I'm warning you.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.304
Goddamn it!

10:57.824 --> 10:59.701
Hang on, McCabe.

10:59.743 --> 11:01.369
Pete. Pete, Pete.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.830
Hey, hey. It's-it's okay.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.457
We're gonna get...

11:05.498 --> 11:07.917
We're gonna get you some help,
okay? Just hang in there.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.294
-It's gonna be okay, all right?

11:09.336 --> 11:10.712
-You're gonna stay with me?

11:10.754 --> 11:12.047
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Stay with me, okay?

11:12.088 --> 11:13.214
Stay back! The evil is here!

11:14.758 --> 11:16.217
-Move, move, move!

11:16.259 --> 11:17.552
-Freeze!
-Stop!

11:17.594 --> 11:20.138
Michael, stay where you are.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.723
You got him, right?

11:21.765 --> 11:24.059
We... Tell me we got him.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.477
OFFICER
Stay right there!

11:25.518 --> 11:26.978
Uh-huh.

11:27.812 --> 11:30.231
We got him?

11:30.273 --> 11:32.525
HAWKINS
Oh, my God.

11:36.154 --> 11:38.281
I'm sorry.

11:38.323 --> 11:40.200
Sorry.

11:40.241 --> 11:42.911
Oh, God.

11:48.291 --> 11:49.584
Stop!

11:49.626 --> 11:51.002
Michael, stay back.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.754
Hold it right there!

11:52.796 --> 11:54.089
...description of
the subject for confirmation.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.549
-It's him.
-It's him.

11:56.591 --> 11:58.134
It's Michael Myers.

12:01.012 --> 12:04.933
Officer Hawkins, tell me,
what happened in here?

12:04.974 --> 12:06.601
Tell me what happened.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.103
Did Michael kill?

12:08.144 --> 12:09.646
Did Michael kill again?

14:24.614 --> 14:26.574
I thought that was
gonna be, like,

14:26.616 --> 14:27.909
a holiday pizza party

14:27.951 --> 14:29.327
with a bunch of coworkers,
not an orgy.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.663
Your vulgar-ass boss
acted inappropriately.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.081
You need to start

14:33.123 --> 14:34.457
standing up for yourself
in these situations.

14:34.499 --> 14:36.084
Yeah, no. That's right.
You're right.

14:36.126 --> 14:37.585
No, stand up for myself.
Now, tomorrow morning,

14:37.627 --> 14:39.254
I'm gonna go in there,
I'm gonna quit that job...

14:39.295 --> 14:41.089
And you're gonna punch
Dr. Mathis in the face.

14:41.131 --> 14:43.425
-Ooh! Champagne.
-Yep. Punch him in the face.

14:43.466 --> 14:45.051
-Okay. -- Yes!
-- Oh, look at you.

14:45.093 --> 14:46.469
With all the shit
happening today,

14:46.511 --> 14:48.263
-two homicides at
a gas station... -

14:48.304 --> 14:50.306
Stop it. We don't even
know if he was on the bus.

14:50.348 --> 14:52.684
Tommy, you're so paranoid.

14:54.144 --> 14:55.937
-Very sous bois.
-Mm, okay.

14:55.979 --> 14:57.605
-Oh. Excuse me.
-Great.

14:57.647 --> 14:59.691
Yeah, that's...
that's a little old French term

14:59.733 --> 15:01.317
meaning this bitch tastes good.

15:02.861 --> 15:04.070
All right!

15:07.323 --> 15:08.783
Hey. Hey.

15:08.825 --> 15:10.910
Hey, hey, guys, guys, guys.

15:10.952 --> 15:12.537
Can you bring it down a tad?

15:12.579 --> 15:14.914
Like, my wife and I are trying
to watch the talent show.

15:14.956 --> 15:16.499
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

15:16.541 --> 15:18.293
-Sorry. -Yeah. Yeah, sorry.
-Sorry about that.

15:18.335 --> 15:20.628
-Appreciate it.
-Okay.

15:22.005 --> 15:23.798
I'm gonna go get us
a couple of drinks.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.467
-You relax.
-Okay.

15:25.508 --> 15:28.261
Well, I'm kind of a
sommelier, but for cheap wines.

15:28.303 --> 15:30.638
-Yeah.
-Yeah, can I get, um,

15:30.680 --> 15:32.307
two of the voodoo
skeleton thing right here?

15:32.349 --> 15:34.601
Hey, look here, don't be
bothered by them motherfuckers

15:34.642 --> 15:36.061
over there, man.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.229
They are friends
with that crazy lady

15:38.271 --> 15:40.982
that almost got killed
by Michael Myers.

15:41.024 --> 15:42.984
No shit.
I-I heard about that.

15:43.026 --> 15:44.486
Wha...
Uh, Laura Stropes or something.

15:44.527 --> 15:46.571
-Laurie Strode.
-Strode, yeah.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.239
The one that survived
Michael Myers.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.033
They come here every Halloween,

15:50.075 --> 15:52.744
and, you know,
tears in their beers.

15:54.579 --> 15:56.831
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to introduce

15:56.873 --> 15:58.541
our next thespian.

15:58.583 --> 16:02.796
Now, I used to bust this guy's
balls when we were kids,

16:02.837 --> 16:04.714
but he is all grown-up now.

16:04.756 --> 16:09.969
And he's become the most
captivating bird whistler.

16:15.392 --> 16:18.561
-Hey, everybody.
-All right, Tommy!

16:18.603 --> 16:20.897
Uh, Lonnie put me up
to this shit.

16:22.399 --> 16:24.901
Uh, I'm not gonna
whistle for you.

16:24.943 --> 16:26.403
I'm, uh... I'm gonna
tell you a story.

16:26.444 --> 16:29.155
-Ghosts and goblins!
-Oh...

16:30.407 --> 16:32.867
-- You got this, Tommy!
-- Turn off the lights!

16:32.909 --> 16:36.538
Any of you know the story
of the Haddonfield Boogeyman?

16:36.579 --> 16:40.208
Too young to give a shit?
Too drunk to remember?

16:40.250 --> 16:45.046
40 years ago, a madman escaped
from a mental hospital.

16:45.088 --> 16:47.090
It was the night
before Halloween,

16:47.132 --> 16:48.925
and three teenage girls

16:48.967 --> 16:50.844
were walking home
from Haddonfield High.

16:50.885 --> 16:53.555
They had sightings of a...

16:53.596 --> 16:57.225
a ghostlike figure creeping
right through our town.

16:57.267 --> 17:00.103
A man in a white mask.

17:00.145 --> 17:03.023
Or was it more than a man?

17:03.064 --> 17:05.442
He was watching them.

17:05.483 --> 17:09.487
Before the night was over,
three people would be murdered.

17:09.529 --> 17:13.158
And in the house next door,
there was a babysitter

17:13.199 --> 17:15.660
and a young boy
and a young girl,

17:15.702 --> 17:18.997
and they were brutally attacked
by this stalker

17:19.039 --> 17:23.335
who had a power beyond
any mortal man.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.881
My name is Tommy Doyle.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.134
And I was that young boy.

17:31.176 --> 17:34.888
So, please, join me

17:34.929 --> 17:38.600
in commemorating the victims

17:38.641 --> 17:42.437
and the survivors
of Michael Myers.

17:42.479 --> 17:45.231
-Thank you.

17:48.318 --> 17:52.781
Now, we have, uh, the lovely
Miss Lindsey Wallace.

17:52.822 --> 17:56.659
Her babysitter, Annie Brackett,
was executed that night.

18:04.292 --> 18:06.711
And we have
Miss Marion Chambers.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.380
She survived an assault.

18:11.007 --> 18:13.510
We have Lonnie Elam.

18:13.551 --> 18:16.513
Lonnie survived
a face-to-face encounter.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.433
Help!

18:21.601 --> 18:23.645
It's Halloween night
in Haddonfield.

18:23.687 --> 18:27.190
When terror's
supposed to be fun.

18:27.232 --> 18:29.693
When we hide behind masks

18:29.734 --> 18:31.945
and we pretend
we aren't what we are.

18:31.986 --> 18:33.822
Is he real?

18:33.863 --> 18:35.657
Who knows?

18:35.699 --> 18:37.659
Who's next?

18:37.701 --> 18:42.205
Maybe not tonight,
maybe not tomorrow,

18:42.247 --> 18:44.332
but the Boogeyman
is coming for me.

18:44.374 --> 18:46.459
And he's coming for you.

18:46.501 --> 18:49.713
But he's not gonna get us.

18:49.754 --> 18:51.214
Not this time.

18:51.256 --> 18:54.843
Because we will never
succumb to fear.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.177
This is for you, Laurie.

18:58.221 --> 18:59.556
Wherever you are.

18:59.597 --> 19:00.974
We're almost at
the hospital, Mom.

19:01.016 --> 19:02.726
Take deep breaths.
Deep breaths.

19:02.767 --> 19:04.686
We're almost there.
We're almost at the hospital.

19:04.728 --> 19:06.771
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.440
It's good. It's good.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.191
-It's okay. It's okay.

19:10.233 --> 19:12.193
No, no, no, no.

19:12.235 --> 19:15.280
-No, no, no, no, no!
-No!

19:15.321 --> 19:17.657
Oh, let it burn!

19:17.699 --> 19:19.242
No!

19:19.284 --> 19:20.910
Let it burn!

19:20.952 --> 19:24.581
MAN Copy that.
Utilities are being shut down.

19:24.622 --> 19:27.542
We got a gas-fed fire in here.

19:27.584 --> 19:29.169
Ten-four. Stand by.

19:29.210 --> 19:30.754
Copy.

19:36.426 --> 19:38.053
Assignment complete.

19:38.094 --> 19:40.221
-Utilities are disengaged.
-Copy.

19:40.263 --> 19:41.806
-Eyes on the roof.
-Watch out.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.558
With you. Let's move.
All right, let's go.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.894
Command Ladder 13, do you copy?

20:09.292 --> 20:12.128
-Mayday. Mayday.

20:13.797 --> 20:15.590
Radio silence.
We have a Mayday alert.

20:15.632 --> 20:17.384
This is Benton
with Engine Eight.

20:17.425 --> 20:19.678
There's been
a structural collapse.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.097
My air supply has been
compromised.

20:22.138 --> 20:24.015
PASS alarm has been activated.

20:24.057 --> 20:26.393
Oh, shit.

20:27.644 --> 20:29.270
Come in, Engine 13.

20:29.312 --> 20:32.357
Oh.
There's someone else down here!

20:32.399 --> 20:34.442
Do you copy?

20:41.032 --> 20:44.411
Central,
we have a firefighter down.

20:45.286 --> 20:48.373
All right, team one,
commence rescue.

20:50.041 --> 20:51.501
Benton?

20:53.253 --> 20:54.462
Benton, my hand's here!

20:54.504 --> 20:56.881
Take my hand!

20:56.923 --> 20:58.717
Take my hand now!

20:58.758 --> 21:00.969
Mayday event.
Send in rescue team now.

21:01.011 --> 21:02.512
Grab my hand!

21:09.019 --> 21:11.771
The fuck is that?

22:17.295 --> 22:19.047
Mom, can you hear us?

22:19.089 --> 22:21.091
-All right.
-She was stabbed in the abdomen.

22:21.132 --> 22:23.093
Activate the trauma team.
We got an unconscious female

22:23.134 --> 22:25.011
-with an abdominal injury.
-Can you hear me, Mom?

22:25.053 --> 22:26.388
Possibly penetrating,
multiple contusions.

22:26.429 --> 22:27.597
Mom, can you hear me?

22:27.639 --> 22:29.724
She's losing a lot of blood.

22:29.766 --> 22:31.267
Ma'am, can you tell me
your name?

22:31.309 --> 22:32.477
Allyson, wait here, honey.

22:32.519 --> 22:34.521
Ma'am, can you tell me
your name?

22:34.562 --> 22:37.315
Um, uh, that's... that's my mom.

22:37.357 --> 22:38.483
It's Laurie Strode.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.610
-Strode. She was attacked.
-Laurie.

22:40.652 --> 22:42.070
She's, uh... she's my mom.

22:42.112 --> 22:43.988
Sh-She's been attacked.
She has probably...

22:44.030 --> 22:46.408
Ma'am, I-I think you should
really let a nurse look at you.

22:46.449 --> 22:47.534
I'm fine.

22:47.575 --> 22:49.828
I'm fine.

22:52.247 --> 22:53.957
It's not my blood.

22:53.998 --> 22:55.333
Okay? It's not my blood.

23:37.500 --> 23:38.960
DOCTOR
We'll close up the fascia,

23:39.002 --> 23:41.880
and, uh, we'll loosely
staple the, uh, skin

23:41.921 --> 23:43.548
so it doesn't get infected.

23:45.508 --> 23:48.053
She's lost a good bit of blood,
but it's all controllable.

23:48.094 --> 23:49.763
I think she'll be fine.

23:49.804 --> 23:53.641
Get her to the floor,
into the ICU tonight.

23:53.683 --> 23:55.977
The internal organ
will be repaired,

23:56.019 --> 23:58.563
and so there shouldn't be
any long-term damage.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.190
Her only concern will be

24:00.231 --> 24:02.984
her abdominal wall will be
very sore from the knife wound

24:03.026 --> 24:05.528
and from our midline
incision here.

24:09.366 --> 24:10.992
Thank you for everything.

24:11.034 --> 24:12.952
Honey.

24:12.994 --> 24:14.537
Hey.

24:14.579 --> 24:16.581
She's gonna be okay.

24:17.457 --> 24:19.584
She's gonna be okay.

24:24.714 --> 24:26.883
Dad's gone.

24:30.512 --> 24:32.764
He'll always be with us.

24:33.723 --> 24:35.975
Even if we can't see him.

24:42.482 --> 24:43.900
WOMAN
No, I'm not afraid to go.

24:43.942 --> 24:46.403
I just don't feel like it.

24:46.444 --> 24:48.488
Besides, I sort of promised
my father

24:48.530 --> 24:49.698
we-we were going to the movies.

24:49.739 --> 24:52.242
I don't hear
no more fire trucks.

24:53.743 --> 24:55.745
Goddamn sleep apnea mask
smells like Lucky Strikes

24:55.787 --> 24:57.539
from when
your mother borrowed it.

24:57.580 --> 24:59.207
I smell it, too.

24:59.249 --> 25:00.667
But that stink ain't cigarettes.

25:00.709 --> 25:02.210
That's Laurie Strode's
house on fire.

25:02.252 --> 25:05.672
Well, from-from upstairs,
it looks like they put it out.

25:05.714 --> 25:08.675
But that nut bag lives
a highly flammable lifestyle.

25:08.717 --> 25:10.719
Better not talk no shit
about that woman.

25:10.760 --> 25:13.138
She will fuck you up.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.557
How about you and I
snack on some Cheez-Its

25:15.598 --> 25:18.810
and try a little
Beaujolais nouveau?

25:20.020 --> 25:22.856
Cheap piece of shit.

25:22.897 --> 25:24.607
You don't know
how to fly that thing.

25:24.649 --> 25:26.401
Give me that controller.

25:26.443 --> 25:28.653
-Here, I got you.

25:33.366 --> 25:35.201
The fuck was that?

25:35.243 --> 25:37.162
Somebody in there?

26:02.020 --> 26:03.772
Hey!

26:09.611 --> 26:11.821
SONDRA
You see anything?

26:31.675 --> 26:33.635
Hey, Sondra. Sondra.

26:33.677 --> 26:35.011
There's a big fella
in our bathroom,

26:35.053 --> 26:37.055
and he's wearing a monster mask.

26:37.097 --> 26:38.723
Well, what the fuck
does he want?

26:38.765 --> 26:41.184
Who gives a shit?
Call the cops!

27:01.538 --> 27:03.957
Run, Sondra! Run!

27:15.885 --> 27:17.929
No.

27:24.060 --> 27:25.895
Please no.

27:31.568 --> 27:32.527
Fuck...

27:55.884 --> 27:58.219
-Sondra!

28:03.350 --> 28:04.726
Sondra!

28:06.561 --> 28:08.521
Sondra!

28:14.611 --> 28:16.571
Sondra!

29:23.096 --> 29:25.181
Hey. I, uh, heard
your speech up there, man.

29:25.223 --> 29:27.267
Like, everybody knows
that story,

29:27.308 --> 29:30.103
everybody is terrified
of that Boogeyman shit,

29:30.145 --> 29:32.105
-and I had no idea.
-No, I appreciate it.

29:32.147 --> 29:33.648
Yeah. Hey, man, let me...
let me buy you guys a round.

29:33.690 --> 29:35.525
-Drink? Drink? Yeah.
-Appreciate it, man. Thank you.

29:35.567 --> 29:37.235
-Sorry about that earlier, too.
-No, no, no, it's fine.

29:37.277 --> 29:39.154
-It's fine. We're all good here.
-Hey, let me see that.

29:39.195 --> 29:40.905
-- I'm a nurse.
-- Oh, okay.

29:40.947 --> 29:42.866
Is he a real doctor?

29:42.907 --> 29:44.409
-Oh. Thank you. Cheers, Tommy.
-Cheers.

29:44.451 --> 29:46.202
-- Yeah.
-- Let me check you out.

29:55.503 --> 29:57.005
Hey there, Bonnie.

29:57.047 --> 29:58.381
You and Clyde need a ride?

29:58.423 --> 30:00.175
Dad, I need you
to come pick me up.

30:00.216 --> 30:02.844
I'm, uh... I'm-I'm at
the park near school,

30:02.886 --> 30:05.263
and, uh, a police officer
was attacked.

30:05.305 --> 30:07.724
-And, uh...
-Where-where are you?

30:13.063 --> 30:15.190
Keep applying pressure
to external hemorrhage.

30:15.231 --> 30:17.025
How's that pulse?

30:26.409 --> 30:28.453
I've been having a bar
about 50 years.

30:28.495 --> 30:30.455
-50 years? -And you started
with your granddaddy, right?

30:30.497 --> 30:32.207
Yeah, my grandpa
who started the business.

30:32.248 --> 30:34.793
That's my grandpa's picture
up here. Yeah, I got...

30:34.834 --> 30:36.419
I got my bat up here.
Huckleberry.

30:36.461 --> 30:37.921
-Old Huckleberry.
-Baseball bat. Excellent.

30:37.962 --> 30:39.297
Oh, if he come back today,
we gonna...

30:39.339 --> 30:40.799
-we got something for him.
-That's right.

30:40.840 --> 30:42.050
-To Brian. To Brian.
-Yeah.

30:42.092 --> 30:43.385
-- To Brian.
-- To Brian.

30:43.426 --> 30:44.844
-Thank you. Yes.
-All right, then.

30:44.886 --> 30:46.054
I knew we came
to the right place.

30:46.096 --> 30:48.139
Hey, guys.
Cameron's in trouble.

30:48.181 --> 30:49.933
Lonnie, what's wrong?

30:49.974 --> 30:51.226
Oh, my God.

30:57.315 --> 30:59.984
Got a goddamn massacre
on our hands.

31:00.026 --> 31:01.444
-Graham!
-Yes, sir.

31:01.486 --> 31:02.696
Establish a perimeter.

31:02.737 --> 31:04.280
Copy that.

31:06.366 --> 31:07.742
Motherfucker!

31:07.784 --> 31:09.744
GRAHAM
Attention, all responders.

31:09.786 --> 31:12.414
Be advised, we have
a violent criminal at large,

31:12.455 --> 31:14.124
armed and dangerous.

31:14.165 --> 31:15.750
We will deploy all units

31:15.792 --> 31:19.462
of frontline and tactical
officers to search the area.

31:20.630 --> 31:23.091
This fugitive is on foot.

31:23.133 --> 31:25.343
His name is Michael Myers.

31:26.344 --> 31:28.054
Go get him.

31:41.276 --> 31:42.944
-Oh, my God.
-Hey, turn it up.

31:42.986 --> 31:45.113
Tommy, look. Hey, turn it up.

31:45.155 --> 31:48.158
...service station
earlier today.

31:48.199 --> 31:50.410
This evening,
four bodies were discovered

31:50.452 --> 31:53.121
in three homes along
the same residential street.

31:53.163 --> 31:56.458
Residents of North Haddonfield
are on high alert.

31:56.499 --> 31:58.293
-Officials are investigating.
-What's gonna stop him?

31:58.335 --> 31:59.711
Less than an hour ago,

31:59.753 --> 32:02.172
Haddonfield authorities
positively identified...

32:02.213 --> 32:03.465
-That's our street.
-...several more victims

32:03.506 --> 32:05.633
in this
South Bastick neighborhood.

32:05.675 --> 32:07.802
That reporter is right
outside Mrs. Dewbottom's house.

32:07.844 --> 32:09.137
That's right next door
to our house.

32:09.179 --> 32:10.597
...two patients of the local

32:10.638 --> 32:12.640
Smith's Grove State Hospital
unaccounted for

32:12.682 --> 32:14.642
after yesterday's
transport bus escape.

32:14.684 --> 32:16.811
Authorities have not
confirmed a connection

32:16.853 --> 32:20.231
between those two events,
but police are encouraging

32:20.273 --> 32:22.442
all residents to remain inside

32:22.484 --> 32:25.070
until further information
is released.

32:25.111 --> 32:28.198
Tonight's tragedy
an eerie reminder of an event

32:28.239 --> 32:30.075
in Haddonfield history

32:30.116 --> 32:32.660
this community has spent
decades trying to forget.

32:32.702 --> 32:34.537
But police now believe
that more people...

32:34.579 --> 32:36.956
I-I remember him
from 40 years ago.

32:36.998 --> 32:39.334
I was laying in my bed,
and he...

32:39.376 --> 32:41.836
he stabbed... he...
he killed her.

32:41.878 --> 32:43.421
That's-that's Julian.
That's that...

32:43.463 --> 32:45.465
That's that little asshole kid
from across the street.

32:45.507 --> 32:47.676
And she was my number-one
main best babysitter.

32:47.717 --> 32:49.678
Yeah, we're gonna go, all right?

32:49.719 --> 32:51.221
Uh, hey, thanks, man.

32:51.262 --> 32:53.348
Um, it was nice meeting
you guys, but we got to go.

32:53.390 --> 32:55.183
-- Be careful. --
Oh, y'all be careful, now.

32:55.225 --> 32:57.268
What the hell is happening?

32:57.310 --> 32:58.687
It's Michael. It's got to be.

32:58.728 --> 33:00.438
WOMAN
I've lived here my whole life.

33:00.480 --> 33:02.732
This was a safe place,
and now it's not anymore.

33:07.070 --> 33:09.406
Shit. I forgot my stethoscope.

33:09.447 --> 33:10.865
Come on, baby,
we got to get home.

33:10.907 --> 33:13.368
I bet that lady still has it.
Hey, I'll be right back.

33:35.598 --> 33:36.850
What?

33:38.768 --> 33:40.270
-What's wrong?

33:40.311 --> 33:41.604
Baby. Baby, baby.

33:41.646 --> 33:42.897
-What? What? What's wrong?
-He's in the car.

33:42.939 --> 33:44.232
-What?
-He's in the car.

33:44.274 --> 33:45.567
-Who? What?
-He's in the back seat.

33:45.608 --> 33:46.901
Michael Myers is
in the back seat. Go look.

33:46.943 --> 33:47.902
-Go look? Hell no!

33:47.944 --> 33:49.738
What's wrong with you?

33:52.782 --> 33:54.409
Somebody help me.
He's here.

33:54.451 --> 33:55.660
He's in the back seat of my car.

33:55.702 --> 33:57.245
I saw him when I went
to go get in.

33:57.287 --> 33:58.747
It's the same guy
you were talking about--

33:58.788 --> 34:00.290
-the one that that was on TV.

34:00.331 --> 34:01.666
Tommy, what are you doing?

34:01.708 --> 34:03.918
That nasty snatcher's
in my parking lot?

34:03.960 --> 34:05.587
Yes, sir.

34:05.628 --> 34:07.297
Love lives today.

34:07.339 --> 34:08.840
But evil dies tonight.

34:10.467 --> 34:13.595
Tommy Doyle's gonna fuck him up.

34:13.636 --> 34:15.096
He's right there, in my car.

34:15.138 --> 34:17.057
He, uh... he got out of the car

34:17.098 --> 34:19.476
and got into the front
of the car.

34:19.517 --> 34:22.020
I saw him.
He looked right at me.

34:38.828 --> 34:40.747
Is it him?

34:40.789 --> 34:42.499
He's watching us.

34:46.211 --> 34:48.088
I got this.

34:48.129 --> 34:50.256
Tommy, be careful.

35:10.985 --> 35:12.153
Michael.

35:12.195 --> 35:13.488
Wake up.

35:13.530 --> 35:15.281
-Oh, my God.

35:15.323 --> 35:17.117
-Tommy, careful!
-Oh, no!

35:17.158 --> 35:19.244
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Whoa!

35:24.124 --> 35:26.126
Damn.
What in the hell's going on?

35:42.475 --> 35:43.852
Fuck!

35:43.893 --> 35:45.520
Come on, come on.

35:47.522 --> 35:49.232
Look at my damn car.

35:49.274 --> 35:51.234
ANNOUNCER
WURG 94.9.

35:51.276 --> 35:52.736
Tommy, careful!

35:52.777 --> 35:56.156
Giving you the urge
with Willie the Kid.

35:56.197 --> 35:58.491
Haddonfield's home for rock.

35:59.492 --> 36:01.995
He thinks he can come
around here and scare us?

36:10.003 --> 36:12.881
I'm gonna rip his mask off,
look him in the eye,

36:12.922 --> 36:16.676
swing Old Huckleberry here
and say night night.

36:18.928 --> 36:20.889
Night night.

36:55.298 --> 36:57.300
Mmm.

36:58.718 --> 37:00.637
Hey, Big John.

37:06.393 --> 37:08.269
Hey, Big John!

37:15.151 --> 37:17.320
Could you turn that down?

37:17.362 --> 37:19.781
Christ, Little John.

37:19.823 --> 37:22.117
I thought we were gonna
watch a movie.

37:22.158 --> 37:23.910
-No.

37:23.952 --> 37:25.161
Fuck that.

37:25.203 --> 37:26.663
It's Halloween.

37:26.705 --> 37:28.998
Pulled some old spooky records.

37:29.040 --> 37:30.792
Want to get high and dance?

37:30.834 --> 37:31.960
It's tempting.

37:33.503 --> 37:36.464
Little late
for trick-or-treaters.

37:38.842 --> 37:41.469
-Argh, matey. -Me and my sister
were trick-or-treating,

37:41.511 --> 37:43.638
and, uh, we got candy bars
from your house,

37:43.680 --> 37:46.224
and when she bit into it,
there was a rusty razor blade.

37:46.266 --> 37:48.059
Wha... All right.
Calm down, calm down.

37:48.101 --> 37:49.519
Now, where is she?

37:49.561 --> 37:51.813
She's right, um... there.

37:53.314 --> 37:55.275
Big John!

37:55.316 --> 37:56.860
Big John, come quick!

37:56.901 --> 37:58.528
What, what, what, what?

37:58.570 --> 38:00.363
-What's happened?
-She's bleeding.

38:00.405 --> 38:02.407
She swallowed a razor blade.
She's still alive.

38:02.449 --> 38:04.743
-Call 911.
-Can you help her?

38:04.784 --> 38:07.078
-Oh.
-She bit her tongue off.

38:07.120 --> 38:08.580
-She's bleeding to death.
-Okay, there's the blade.

38:08.621 --> 38:10.665
-It's in the barf.

38:12.042 --> 38:13.668
The fuck was that?

38:13.710 --> 38:15.503
Did someone just go
in our house?

38:18.256 --> 38:19.716
Oh, my God.

38:19.758 --> 38:21.426
-What is it? What?
-Are you okay?

38:21.468 --> 38:22.677
-Boo!
-Aah! Jesus!

38:22.719 --> 38:25.096
-We scared you!

38:26.389 --> 38:28.433
I got it!

38:28.475 --> 38:30.393
You think this is funny, huh?

38:30.435 --> 38:33.271
We got you good.

38:33.313 --> 38:35.440
I stole the whole damn bowl.

38:37.025 --> 38:39.277
You don't know who
you're messing with, do you?

38:39.319 --> 38:40.779
Take it easy, Big John.

38:40.820 --> 38:42.864
-They're too young to know.
-Too young to know what?

38:42.906 --> 38:45.617
Do you have any idea
whose house this was?

38:45.658 --> 38:47.535
No.

38:47.577 --> 38:50.872
You ever hear of
Michael fucking Myers?

38:50.914 --> 38:53.583
And do you know
what happens to people

38:53.625 --> 38:57.712
who come into the Myers home
without an invitation?

38:57.754 --> 38:59.172
We're not even scared.

38:59.214 --> 39:02.467
-Oh, yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

39:02.509 --> 39:05.345
He stabbed his sister
in the tits.

39:05.387 --> 39:08.807
-Yuck.
-Right upstairs.

39:11.726 --> 39:16.231
And sometimes,
when the wind blows just right,

39:16.272 --> 39:19.234
we can still hear her ghost

39:19.275 --> 39:21.444
calling out his name.

39:21.486 --> 39:23.446
Oh, sh-she calls.

39:23.488 --> 39:25.073
Mm-hmm.

39:25.115 --> 39:28.493
Michael.

39:28.535 --> 39:32.038
BOTH
Michael...

39:33.623 --> 39:35.250
Get out of my yard,
you little perverts!

39:38.253 --> 39:40.547
-Wh-What was that?

40:09.367 --> 40:11.745
All right, let's go. Let's get
him into code room three.

40:11.786 --> 40:13.788
-What have we got here?
-Internal bleeding,

40:13.830 --> 40:15.623
lacerations,
but he's gonna make it.

40:15.665 --> 40:17.208
Call Respiratory
for a ventilator.

40:17.250 --> 40:18.793
-Officer Hawkins.
-Go. Go, go, go.

40:18.835 --> 40:20.378
Make sure trauma two is prepped.

40:20.420 --> 40:22.672
And I need help
getting him on the table.

40:38.021 --> 40:40.857
Allyson. Allyson.

40:42.359 --> 40:44.527
Hey. Can I speak with you?

40:44.569 --> 40:46.821
Ask you a few questions?

40:51.868 --> 40:54.829
I was always told
that I couldn't...

40:56.748 --> 40:59.084
I couldn't talk about Michael.

41:00.001 --> 41:02.587
I could never acknowledge
the tragedy.

41:02.629 --> 41:04.798
It was as if
my mother's biggest fear

41:04.839 --> 41:06.633
was that my grandmother
was right

41:06.675 --> 41:09.344
and the Boogeyman was real.

41:09.386 --> 41:11.179
For 40 years, he was waiting

41:11.221 --> 41:12.722
to come and kill my mother.

41:12.764 --> 41:15.183
He found where she lived.

41:15.225 --> 41:17.560
He came to her house.

41:19.145 --> 41:21.231
She put us in his path.

41:23.608 --> 41:25.902
He murdered my husband.

41:26.820 --> 41:28.655
That's what happened.

41:28.697 --> 41:30.657
Well, so how did Michael know?

41:30.699 --> 41:34.035
How did he know how to find
your grandmother?

41:34.077 --> 41:35.620
He didn't.

41:35.662 --> 41:37.247
It was his doctor.

41:37.288 --> 41:39.374
Michael's doctor.

41:39.416 --> 41:41.543
He is the one that...

41:41.584 --> 41:43.878
He took him there.
He knew where to go.

41:43.920 --> 41:47.007
And he's the one
that brought them together.

41:48.842 --> 41:51.720
It was his obsession,

41:51.761 --> 41:53.471
not Michael's.

41:53.513 --> 41:55.140
But we got him.

41:55.181 --> 41:58.059
Shot him in the face,
burned him alive

41:58.101 --> 42:00.729
so he can't hurt anyone
ever again.

42:04.774 --> 42:06.568
I'm sorry, Karen.

42:06.609 --> 42:08.486
Thank you.

42:08.528 --> 42:10.405
No one told you?

42:10.447 --> 42:12.365
Told me what?

42:15.869 --> 42:18.246
Michael Myers is alive.

42:18.288 --> 42:19.289
What?!

42:20.415 --> 42:22.083
Allyson, Allyson!
Allyson, are you okay?

42:22.125 --> 42:23.960
-Oh, sorry.
-Slow down.

42:24.002 --> 42:26.171
-Allyson, please wait.
-Excuse me. Excuse me.

42:26.212 --> 42:29.090
I'm so sorry. I just want to
help in any way I can, okay?

42:29.132 --> 42:31.092
-He's still alive.
-We're going after him.

42:31.134 --> 42:32.969
Me, my dad, you,
if you want to come.

42:33.011 --> 42:34.929
-We're joining Tommy Doyle.

42:36.306 --> 42:39.059
You need to get
everybody here now.

42:39.100 --> 42:41.353
If he is alive,
he is on his way here.

42:41.394 --> 42:43.104
Mom.

42:43.146 --> 42:45.899
Honey, I want you to go
and sit in Grandmother's room

42:45.940 --> 42:47.942
and wait there
until she wakes up, okay?

42:47.984 --> 42:49.778
-No. -No, no, no.
She-she's coming with us.

42:49.819 --> 42:51.237
-We're joining Tommy Doyle.
-She what?

42:51.279 --> 42:53.198
I don't know if you've heard,
but they've...

42:53.239 --> 42:54.949
No, the police officers should
be on their way here right now.

42:54.991 --> 42:56.701
Tommy's organizing groups,
groups of people that care.

42:56.743 --> 42:58.370
We're gonna go after him.
We're gonna find Michael.

42:58.411 --> 43:00.914
I'm going with them.
We're gonna hunt him down,

43:00.955 --> 43:02.791
-and we're gonna put
an end to this. -Yeah.

43:02.832 --> 43:05.126
No, he is on his way here.
I keep telling them that.

43:05.168 --> 43:08.088
He is stalking her, and we are
staying here to protect her.

43:08.129 --> 43:10.757
He's infected your family,
he's infected my family

43:10.799 --> 43:12.884
with grief and fear
for 40 years.

43:12.926 --> 43:14.511
He's gonna die tonight.

43:14.552 --> 43:16.388
-He killed Dad. -Clear
the hallway! You have to move!

43:16.429 --> 43:18.765
Excuse me! My husband,
he's been very badly hurt!

43:18.807 --> 43:20.558
-Clear the hallway, people.

43:20.600 --> 43:22.143
Go back to the waiting area.

43:22.185 --> 43:24.646
Go back to the waiting room.
Clear the hallway.

43:24.688 --> 43:27.315
I'm not gonna pretend
this didn't happen.

43:27.357 --> 43:29.109
I love Dad, and somebody loves

43:29.150 --> 43:32.195
whoever is laying
under those sheets right now.

43:33.446 --> 43:35.949
Look. Look at me.
We failed, baby.

43:35.990 --> 43:38.076
We set a trap,
we set the whole thing on fire,

43:38.118 --> 43:39.953
and he lived through it.
Think about that.

43:39.994 --> 43:42.080
The police are out there
looking for him.

43:42.122 --> 43:44.708
You think you're the one
that's gonna find him?

43:44.749 --> 43:48.169
Sit in that room
and wait with your grandmother.

43:48.211 --> 43:49.879
Now!

43:54.634 --> 43:56.594
Does the hospital have
security guards?

43:56.636 --> 43:58.138
Do you have security guards?

43:58.179 --> 43:59.889
It seems like you should have
security guards

43:59.931 --> 44:01.891
in case something
like this happens.

44:01.933 --> 44:03.560
And this is happening right now.

44:03.601 --> 44:06.521
I mean, my daughter is in here,
my mother is in here,

44:06.563 --> 44:08.773
there is a madman
on the loose...

44:08.815 --> 44:10.734
Oh! Oh, God!

44:18.575 --> 44:20.118
Goodbye, Michael.

44:52.692 --> 44:56.029
This is for you,
whenever you need it.

45:13.588 --> 45:15.924
She's here. She's here.
We found her. Laurie's here.

45:15.965 --> 45:18.426
She's in recovery.

45:18.468 --> 45:19.803
It's lucky she survived.

45:19.844 --> 45:21.554
I just heard from
one of the police officers

45:21.596 --> 45:22.972
at her compound.

45:23.014 --> 45:25.100
11 dead bodies.
They're all first responders.

45:25.141 --> 45:27.018
Holy shit.
Cameron's in there.

45:27.060 --> 45:29.020
Three of his friends
were killed.

45:29.062 --> 45:30.772
-It's a madhouse.
-All right, Lonnie, listen.

45:30.814 --> 45:32.857
The only way
we're gonna stop this

45:32.899 --> 45:34.818
is if we all come together
on this.

45:34.859 --> 45:36.069
You're goddamn right.

45:36.111 --> 45:37.821
-All right. All right.
-All right?

45:39.739 --> 45:42.158
How about this sassy tackle?

45:43.702 --> 45:45.161
You have a permit for all these?

45:45.203 --> 45:46.246
Some of 'em.

45:46.287 --> 45:48.873
-- Dad.
-- Hey, hey.

45:50.166 --> 45:52.085
-Where's your girlfriend?
-Uh, she's okay.

45:52.127 --> 45:53.920
-She's gonna stay
with her family. -Good for her.

45:53.962 --> 45:55.505
-Hey, Mr. Doyle.
-Hey, buddy.

45:55.547 --> 45:57.882
-Lonnie, check it out.

46:00.969 --> 46:03.013
You guys are coming, too?

46:03.054 --> 46:04.472
Couldn't let you have
all the fun.

46:04.514 --> 46:06.224
So many victims
in our neighborhood.

46:06.266 --> 46:07.726
Close friends of ours,
and we just want to help out.

46:07.767 --> 46:08.977
I'm a doctor.
My husband's a nurse.

46:09.019 --> 46:10.603
I should've guessed.

46:10.645 --> 46:12.439
All right, we have to give all
these people protection.

46:12.480 --> 46:14.149
-You got to share your shit,
Lonnie. -All right.

46:14.190 --> 46:16.067
You coming with us?

46:16.109 --> 46:18.111
Let's see what you got.

46:18.153 --> 46:20.030
Yeah, just help yourself.

46:21.531 --> 46:24.993
Michael Myers has haunted
this town for 40 years.

46:26.703 --> 46:28.496
Tonight, we hunt him down.

46:34.377 --> 46:36.504
Excuse me.
I need some good people.

46:36.546 --> 46:38.548
People who aren't afraid
to get their hands dirty.

46:38.590 --> 46:40.258
Everybody else needs to go home.

46:42.052 --> 46:44.054
So, what do we do
if we find him?

46:44.095 --> 46:45.764
Go inside. Go inside.

46:45.805 --> 46:47.515
It's not safe to be out. Go.

46:47.557 --> 46:49.059
It's not safe to be out.

46:49.100 --> 46:51.728
Man, I had an altercation
with Myers about an hour ago,

46:51.770 --> 46:53.271
but he escaped.

46:53.313 --> 46:55.023
Now, listen, boys,
there's strength in numbers.

46:55.065 --> 46:57.108
You cover Spring Creek
to the bypass,

46:57.150 --> 46:59.152
and then let me know
if you see anything.

46:59.194 --> 47:02.280
This man is a threat,
and we need to stop him tonight!

47:03.865 --> 47:05.867
Nobody ever took him seriously.

47:05.909 --> 47:07.660
-Who?
-Dr. Loomis,

47:07.702 --> 47:09.704
Michael's first doctor.

47:09.746 --> 47:11.373
He knew a killer
when he saw one.

47:11.414 --> 47:13.291
Now, the only way to catch him

47:13.333 --> 47:16.044
is to play by his own game--
the element of surprise.

47:16.086 --> 47:17.837
So he thinks
you're going one place,

47:17.879 --> 47:20.090
then you pop up someplace else.

47:20.131 --> 47:22.092
And keep your eyes open.

47:24.844 --> 47:26.054
Eyes open.

47:31.434 --> 47:33.728
Wait, what's going on
over there?

47:33.770 --> 47:35.605
Baby, who is that?

47:35.647 --> 47:37.649
Looks like kids.

47:37.691 --> 47:39.150
They all alone?

47:39.192 --> 47:41.277
Marion, give me the flashlight.

47:41.319 --> 47:43.405
It's the wrong night to be out.

47:43.446 --> 47:44.572
Careful, Lindsey.

47:44.614 --> 47:46.324
-Lindsey, I wouldn't go...
-Stay here.

47:49.786 --> 47:51.413
Never fired a gun before.

47:51.454 --> 47:53.915
Right, so I don't even know
why they gave you a gun.

47:53.957 --> 47:55.792
It's big, too.
Can you handle it?

47:55.834 --> 47:57.085
-That's a no.

47:57.127 --> 47:58.253
Give me, give me.
I shot this shit before.

47:58.294 --> 47:59.754
Okay. If you want it.

47:59.796 --> 48:00.839
I got it.

48:00.880 --> 48:02.632
Okay. Fine.

48:04.759 --> 48:06.469
Hey.

48:06.511 --> 48:08.430
What are you guys
doing out here?

48:08.471 --> 48:10.265
It's Halloween.
We've been trick-or-treating.

48:10.306 --> 48:11.850
-We got a whole bag of candy.
-You guys should not be

48:11.891 --> 48:13.226
out here right now, okay?
It's not safe.

48:13.268 --> 48:14.436
-You gonna kill me?
-CHRISTY No.

48:14.477 --> 48:15.603
Satan, not today.

48:15.645 --> 48:17.772
-Oh, I'm so scared.
-Are you guys alone?

48:17.814 --> 48:19.315
-Where are your parents?
-No.

48:19.357 --> 48:21.026
No, we're waiting
for our friend.

48:21.067 --> 48:22.652
And, like, there's
a creepy man in a white mask,

48:22.694 --> 48:25.405
and he keeps, like, trying
to play hide-and-seek with us,

48:25.447 --> 48:27.615
-and he thinks...
-And I think he's a pervert.

48:27.657 --> 48:28.908
Where did you see him?

48:28.950 --> 48:30.160
He's just hiding behind trees.

48:30.201 --> 48:31.286
And he pops out like,
"Peekaboo!"

48:31.327 --> 48:32.954
I mean, we're not
three years old.

48:32.996 --> 48:34.289
-Come on, man!
-Oh, look, there he is.

48:34.330 --> 48:37.000
-Oh, hello!
-Hello.

48:37.042 --> 48:39.044
MINDY
What the hell are you doing?

48:40.837 --> 48:43.006
You want some candy?

48:45.675 --> 48:47.552
Is that Dennis's mask?

48:47.594 --> 48:49.262
Run. Go home now.

48:49.304 --> 48:51.306
Before he kills us all!
Get out of here!

48:51.348 --> 48:53.141
Run! Do not turn around!

48:53.183 --> 48:55.060
Keep going home!

48:56.019 --> 48:57.395
Oh, my God.

48:57.437 --> 48:59.314
What if someone is disabled?

48:59.356 --> 49:01.149
-Like, that doesn't make any
sense... -Yeah, but...

49:01.191 --> 49:03.068
-What the hell is that?

49:03.109 --> 49:04.778
-What the fuck?
-It's Michael.

49:09.366 --> 49:11.659
Fuck this bullshit! Drive!

49:11.701 --> 49:13.161
Go! Go!

49:22.128 --> 49:23.755
Drive the fucking...

49:25.507 --> 49:26.841
God!

49:28.718 --> 49:31.096
-No, whoa! Jesus, Marion.
-Marion, watch it!

49:35.558 --> 49:37.143
-Marion, the door's locked!
-I don't want to die in here!

49:37.185 --> 49:38.687
-Unlock the door!
-Unlock the door! -Oh!

49:38.728 --> 49:40.605
-Come on! -Let me out of here!
-Move! He's behind you!

49:40.647 --> 49:42.691
-The door's locked, Marion.
-Move!

49:47.404 --> 49:48.530
Go, go!

49:48.571 --> 49:49.364
Vanessa, go!

49:49.406 --> 49:51.282
Get out of the fucking car!

49:51.324 --> 49:54.077
-I love you, baby!

49:54.119 --> 49:56.454
No!

49:56.496 --> 49:58.540
-Let go of her!

49:59.582 --> 50:02.168
-Okay, come on. We got to go.
We got to go. -Oh, God.

50:03.753 --> 50:06.214
MARION
No.

50:06.256 --> 50:07.757
Shoot him! Shoot him, Marion!

50:07.799 --> 50:09.217
Hey, Michael.

50:09.259 --> 50:11.553
This is for Dr. Loomis.

50:19.060 --> 50:21.187
-Oh, God. No!
-Marion!

50:30.613 --> 50:32.949
Come on. Die.

50:32.991 --> 50:35.744
Die, die, die!

53:27.916 --> 53:30.418
-Mom. Oh, God. No, wait.

53:30.460 --> 53:33.088
Stop, stop, please.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

53:33.129 --> 53:34.631
-I'm fine.
-You're not fine.

53:34.673 --> 53:37.467
You had a knife
in your fucking stomach.

53:37.509 --> 53:39.803
It's a paper cut.

53:39.844 --> 53:41.763
Where's Allyson?

53:42.889 --> 53:45.350
She was supposed
to be in here, with you.

53:45.392 --> 53:47.268
-You didn't see her?
-Nah...

53:47.310 --> 53:49.813
I'm so geeked out
on pain meds, kiddo.

53:49.854 --> 53:52.315
Uh, uh, no.

53:55.235 --> 53:56.820
Is everything okay?

53:58.780 --> 54:00.699
She probably just needed
some fresh air.

54:03.076 --> 54:06.830
My God, they just leave your
bloody shirt just sitting here?

54:09.165 --> 54:11.042
Karen.

54:12.085 --> 54:14.337
Karen.

54:15.338 --> 54:17.507
Michael's gone.

54:18.341 --> 54:20.010
We got him.

54:20.051 --> 54:21.803
That's right. We got him.

54:21.845 --> 54:25.598
We burned him
to the goddamn ground.

54:25.640 --> 54:27.934
-Excuse us.

54:27.976 --> 54:30.186
Pardon.

54:30.228 --> 54:31.771
-Uh, over here.
-Frank?

54:31.813 --> 54:33.982
-- Go a little further back.
-- Okay. Okay.

54:34.024 --> 54:35.316
-Got the draw sheet?
-Yeah.

54:35.358 --> 54:36.651
One, two...

54:36.693 --> 54:38.236
-There you go.

54:38.278 --> 54:39.696
Okay.

54:41.239 --> 54:43.033
You knew my dad?

54:43.074 --> 54:45.368
Yeah, I knew Ray.

54:45.410 --> 54:48.329
He used to sell me peyote.

54:48.371 --> 54:52.542
I remember once we were out
on Lake Cherokee in this canoe

54:52.584 --> 54:55.003
with a shaman from Little Rock.

54:55.045 --> 54:58.923
Your-your daddy got freaked out

54:58.965 --> 55:00.759
by his own reflection.

55:00.800 --> 55:03.303
He took off his pants,
and he jumped in.

55:05.096 --> 55:07.515
I stopped doing drugs with him,

55:07.557 --> 55:10.393
but I'll-I'll miss him.

55:10.435 --> 55:12.228
-- Dad.
-- What? It's true.

55:12.270 --> 55:14.314
No, no, no.
Dad, look, right there.

55:14.356 --> 55:16.608
You see that? That's Tommy.

55:16.649 --> 55:19.069
-- Yeah.
-- Whose car is that?

55:19.110 --> 55:21.404
Lindsey's. Shit.

55:25.075 --> 55:26.534
Lindsey's car.

55:26.576 --> 55:28.453
It's covered in blood.
There's no bodies.

55:28.495 --> 55:30.413
It's Michael.

55:30.455 --> 55:32.248
He's here.

55:32.290 --> 55:34.584
Come on, I need you guys.
Come on.

55:34.626 --> 55:35.794
Be careful now, all right?

55:35.835 --> 55:37.212
Keep your heads up, eyes open.

55:37.253 --> 55:38.880
Okay. Let's go, let's go.

55:39.631 --> 55:41.383
Lindsey!

55:41.424 --> 55:43.593
-- Okay.
-- Just be safe, okay?

55:43.635 --> 55:45.428
You, too. Lindsey!

55:45.470 --> 55:47.555
Lindsey!

55:50.058 --> 55:51.393
Lindsey!

55:51.434 --> 55:53.436
-- Marion!
-- Marion!

55:57.357 --> 55:59.192
You guys be careful, okay?

55:59.234 --> 56:00.902
Keep your heads up.

56:02.404 --> 56:04.614
Oh, shit, Tommy.

56:08.284 --> 56:10.453
Oh, fuck.

56:15.458 --> 56:17.168
Oh, God.

56:33.143 --> 56:34.686
Fuck me.

56:34.728 --> 56:36.604
Yo, Dad, Dad.
What's over there?

56:36.646 --> 56:38.857
We found something.

56:39.983 --> 56:41.776
Oh, God.

56:44.487 --> 56:47.115
Oh, I'm sorry.

56:47.157 --> 56:49.617
-That's Marion, Lonnie.
-He did this.

56:49.659 --> 56:52.620
Oh, God, Marion.

56:52.662 --> 56:55.248
Tommy, what the fuck?

56:55.290 --> 56:58.001
I'm gonna get you.

56:58.043 --> 57:00.503
Come and get it, man.

57:07.135 --> 57:08.511
Over here.

57:08.553 --> 57:10.764
She's over here.

57:10.805 --> 57:13.350
LINDSEY
I saw his face.

57:13.391 --> 57:14.559
I saw everything.

57:14.601 --> 57:15.810
He's still out there.

57:15.852 --> 57:17.395
-She's lucky to be alive.
-I saw him.

57:17.437 --> 57:18.646
You saw his face?

57:18.688 --> 57:20.815
He's still out there, Tommy.

57:20.857 --> 57:22.817
You'll be okay, Lindsey.

57:22.859 --> 57:24.361
You're gonna be okay.

57:24.402 --> 57:26.988
He's still out there.

57:30.158 --> 57:32.035
Frank.

57:34.329 --> 57:36.289
Frank, are you awake?

57:43.713 --> 57:46.549
Do you remember that night?

57:46.591 --> 57:48.885
At the bar?

57:50.095 --> 57:52.389
You know, I-I never
said anything,

57:52.430 --> 57:54.766
'cause I couldn't be sure.

57:57.602 --> 57:59.938
I was so messed up.

58:07.070 --> 58:09.030
But you helped me.

58:13.076 --> 58:14.911
I always liked you.

58:17.997 --> 58:20.875
-You so crazy.

58:20.917 --> 58:22.877
Fuck you.

58:26.047 --> 58:27.590
Hi.

58:28.425 --> 58:30.593
Hi.

58:32.387 --> 58:34.305
I remember that night.

58:34.347 --> 58:36.141
Yeah.

58:37.767 --> 58:39.561
I kissed you.

58:39.602 --> 58:41.563
Yeah.

58:41.604 --> 58:43.440
I remember.

58:43.481 --> 58:45.734
You held my hand.

58:47.110 --> 58:48.903
That was it.

58:48.945 --> 58:51.823
Now, I was hoping for more.

58:53.366 --> 58:56.453
But I knew you were sweet for...

58:58.580 --> 59:00.832
Ben Tramer.

59:06.004 --> 59:07.380
Frank.

59:10.383 --> 59:12.218
We got him.

59:13.261 --> 59:15.805
We killed Michael.

59:16.598 --> 59:18.391
You ki...

59:21.186 --> 59:23.146
Well, it's about time.

59:23.188 --> 59:24.939
Ow.

59:24.981 --> 59:27.567
-Ow. Don't make me laugh.

59:27.609 --> 59:30.028
Oh, good. You're awake.

59:31.863 --> 59:33.698
Now, on a scale from one to ten,

59:33.740 --> 59:36.493
what is your pain level,
with ten being the worst?

59:36.534 --> 59:37.994
Number 11.

59:38.870 --> 59:40.538
This will make the pain go away.

59:42.999 --> 59:44.292
Laurie.

59:44.334 --> 59:47.087
Nurse, will you do me a favor?

59:47.879 --> 59:49.631
Help out my friend here.

59:49.673 --> 59:52.217
Make it a double.

59:52.258 --> 59:54.719
You stood up to that monster.

59:54.761 --> 59:56.763
I tried, Tommy.

59:56.805 --> 59:58.807
You know, when we were kids,

59:58.848 --> 1:00:00.809
we used to all dare each other

1:00:00.850 --> 1:00:02.811
to sneak into
the old Myers house.

1:00:04.354 --> 1:00:07.649
Lonnie was the only one
brave enough to do it.

1:00:07.691 --> 1:00:09.442
I lied.

1:00:10.527 --> 1:00:13.321
I never made it inside.

1:00:13.363 --> 1:00:15.407
When they arrested
Michael that night,

1:00:15.448 --> 1:00:18.076
I was telling my wife
that my daughter was killed,

1:00:18.118 --> 1:00:21.079
so I wasn't there to put
a bullet in his brain,

1:00:21.121 --> 1:00:23.164
like we should have.
This is no time for prudence.

1:00:23.206 --> 1:00:25.500
How'm I supposed to know
if my brother's alive or not?

1:00:25.542 --> 1:00:27.752
-I-I don't know. -I've been
waiting here for over an hour.

1:00:27.794 --> 1:00:29.713
Who the hell's in charge here?

1:00:29.754 --> 1:00:31.256
Authorized medical
and security personnel only.

1:00:31.297 --> 1:00:33.008
There's not enough medical
or security help.

1:00:33.049 --> 1:00:34.509
-He's going to kill everybody!
-You need to relax.

1:00:34.551 --> 1:00:36.094
We've requested backup officers
and medical staff

1:00:36.136 --> 1:00:37.595
from Russellville
and Eaton County for support,

1:00:37.637 --> 1:00:38.930
but no confirmation.

1:00:38.972 --> 1:00:40.849
We can't handle
this scope a crime scene.

1:00:40.890 --> 1:00:42.892
My son.
My son Oscar, is he here?

1:00:42.934 --> 1:00:44.060
Uh, I got a call.

1:00:44.102 --> 1:00:45.770
I'm his mother. Is he alive?

1:00:45.812 --> 1:00:47.147
I have no idea, but triage
expansion just opened up.

1:00:47.188 --> 1:00:48.648
I'm gonna have you sign in
right here.

1:00:48.690 --> 1:00:50.025
It's spelled B-E-R-L-U-C-C-H-I.

1:00:50.066 --> 1:00:51.443
Clear the hallway, please.

1:00:51.484 --> 1:00:52.485
Somebody help!

1:00:52.527 --> 1:00:53.862
Please, emergency.

1:00:53.903 --> 1:00:55.030
Take her to
the emergency room, please.

1:00:55.071 --> 1:00:56.614
You're gonna be okay, Linds.

1:00:56.656 --> 1:00:57.907
He's still out there, Tommy.

1:00:57.949 --> 1:00:59.659
-Be careful.
-Karen.

1:00:59.701 --> 1:01:01.411
How are you doing?
How's your mom?

1:01:01.453 --> 1:01:02.954
-How's Laurie? Is she okay?
-Where's my daughter?

1:01:02.996 --> 1:01:04.372
She's okay. She's fine.

1:01:04.414 --> 1:01:05.457
She's with Lonnie and Cameron.

1:01:05.498 --> 1:01:06.666
No, no, but he's coming here.

1:01:06.708 --> 1:01:07.959
She's not supposed
to be with them.

1:01:08.001 --> 1:01:09.919
He's coming here?
How do you know that?

1:01:09.961 --> 1:01:12.797
All right, secure a perimeter.
Hospital's on lockdown.

1:01:12.839 --> 1:01:15.383
-All right, listen, folks.
Listen! -

1:01:15.425 --> 1:01:16.885
Folks, please.

1:01:16.926 --> 1:01:18.553
-The Boogeyman is at large.

1:01:18.595 --> 1:01:21.389
He's got no choice
but to emerge.

1:01:21.431 --> 1:01:23.224
He is an apex predator.

1:01:23.266 --> 1:01:25.560
When he surfaces,
there will be no pause.

1:01:25.602 --> 1:01:27.062
There will be no empathy.

1:01:27.103 --> 1:01:29.731
This ends when Michael is dead!

1:01:29.773 --> 1:01:31.941
Michael Myers will be
executed tonight,

1:01:31.983 --> 1:01:34.986
and it will not go
without witness!

1:01:35.028 --> 1:01:38.323
We need all of you.

1:01:38.365 --> 1:01:40.784
-Evil dies tonight!

1:01:40.825 --> 1:01:41.826
Evil dies tonight!

1:01:41.868 --> 1:01:43.745
All right, everybody, calm down.

1:01:43.787 --> 1:01:44.871
The Sheriff's Department
has this...

1:01:44.913 --> 1:01:45.997
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1:01:46.039 --> 1:01:47.332
Sheriff, we will not calm down.

1:01:47.374 --> 1:01:49.000
We have watched
your department fail...

1:01:49.042 --> 1:01:50.669
-fail tonight!
-Tommy's right!

1:01:50.710 --> 1:01:51.961
This is Haddonfield.

1:01:52.003 --> 1:01:53.922
This is our town.

1:01:53.963 --> 1:01:56.841
He killed my daughter
40 years ago

1:01:56.883 --> 1:01:58.843
and desecrated her body.

1:01:58.885 --> 1:02:00.095
Evil dies tonight.

1:02:00.136 --> 1:02:01.596
Goddamn it, Brackett!

1:02:01.638 --> 1:02:03.765
I am the law, not you.

1:02:03.807 --> 1:02:05.934
-Fuck off, Barker.
-Jonesy, get over there!

1:02:05.975 --> 1:02:07.185
-Robin, I need you up there.

1:02:07.227 --> 1:02:08.853
I need you over here.
You two...

1:02:08.895 --> 1:02:10.230
-Laurie!

1:02:10.271 --> 1:02:11.815
-Tommy, you can't
go in there! -Tommy?

1:02:11.856 --> 1:02:13.525
-Tommy, you can't go in there!
-Laurie. Laurie.

1:02:13.566 --> 1:02:15.110
-Tommy!
-Tommy.

1:02:15.151 --> 1:02:17.070
-Laurie. He killed Marion.
-Tommy.

1:02:17.112 --> 1:02:19.698
-And he attacked Lindsey, too.
-What? Karen.

1:02:19.739 --> 1:02:21.866
We didn't know for sure.
I didn't know what to tell you.

1:02:21.908 --> 1:02:24.327
Mom, I just want you to be okay.

1:02:24.369 --> 1:02:26.329
Listen, I just want you to know,
when he gets here,

1:02:26.371 --> 1:02:29.290
I'm gonna fucking kill him,
because 40 years ago,

1:02:29.332 --> 1:02:31.793
-when I was a kid,
you protected me. -Yeah.

1:02:31.835 --> 1:02:34.254
So, tonight,
I'm gonna protect you. Okay?

1:02:34.295 --> 1:02:36.631
Nurse.
You know, I appreciate you,

1:02:36.673 --> 1:02:38.675
but could you get out, please?

1:02:38.717 --> 1:02:40.593
Like, get out now!

1:02:41.761 --> 1:02:42.971
We had him.

1:02:43.013 --> 1:02:44.472
How did he escape?

1:02:44.514 --> 1:02:45.974
I don't know. I don't know.

1:02:46.016 --> 1:02:47.642
What do we do? We don't
have the police support.

1:02:47.684 --> 1:02:49.310
We fight.

1:02:49.352 --> 1:02:50.562
We always fight.

1:02:50.603 --> 1:02:53.231
-Go! Find him, Tommy!
-Yeah. I will. I will.

1:02:53.273 --> 1:02:55.191
-I... No.
-Mom, don't. Don't.

1:02:55.233 --> 1:02:56.735
I need you to listen to me.

1:02:56.776 --> 1:02:58.445
You need to listen to me
right now, okay?

1:02:58.486 --> 1:03:01.865
All right, a lifetime
of preparation, and for what?

1:03:01.906 --> 1:03:03.742
Ray is dead.

1:03:03.783 --> 1:03:05.326
So many people are dead.

1:03:05.368 --> 1:03:06.828
We're not equipped.

1:03:06.870 --> 1:03:09.664
Allyson's run off
with crazy Lonnie Elam.

1:03:09.706 --> 1:03:11.833
People are losing their minds.

1:03:11.875 --> 1:03:14.419
There are authorities
who are trained

1:03:14.461 --> 1:03:17.422
to deal with exactly
this kind of... this...

1:03:17.464 --> 1:03:19.966
There's a system.

1:03:20.800 --> 1:03:23.178
Well, the system failed.

1:03:23.219 --> 1:03:25.096
Now, get the fuck out of my way.

1:03:25.138 --> 1:03:27.015
-Don't. No. No.
-No, no, no. Get away.

1:03:27.057 --> 1:03:28.183
-What are you doing?
-Karen, no!

1:03:28.224 --> 1:03:29.225
-Stop right now!
-Get away!

1:03:29.267 --> 1:03:30.810
I am not gonna let you do this.

1:03:30.852 --> 1:03:32.187
-No. Mom.
-Get out of my way.

1:03:32.228 --> 1:03:34.064
-Move! -Mom, please,
what are you doing?

1:03:36.274 --> 1:03:38.693
Do you even know what that is?

1:03:40.695 --> 1:03:42.572
It makes the pain go away.

1:03:48.953 --> 1:03:50.538
Let him come for me.

1:03:50.580 --> 1:03:51.748
No.

1:03:51.790 --> 1:03:54.042
Let him take my head
as I take his.

1:03:54.084 --> 1:03:56.795
-No.
-Maybe the only way he can die

1:03:56.836 --> 1:03:57.962
is if I die, too.

1:03:58.004 --> 1:04:00.715
-No.
-Karen, you and Allyson

1:04:00.757 --> 1:04:02.425
should not have to keep running

1:04:02.467 --> 1:04:06.137
because of the darkness
that I created, honey.

1:04:06.179 --> 1:04:08.723
So you just have to let me go.

1:04:08.765 --> 1:04:10.809
-Karen, move!
-Mom, stop. Stop, Mom.

1:04:10.850 --> 1:04:13.186
Listen. Mom.

1:04:15.563 --> 1:04:18.233
Stop.

1:04:18.274 --> 1:04:21.486
I am not gonna let
anything happen to you.

1:04:23.780 --> 1:04:25.824
We want to get married.

1:04:25.865 --> 1:04:27.992
Um...

1:04:28.034 --> 1:04:31.121
Uh, I-I guess, uh, right away.

1:04:31.162 --> 1:04:32.914
Right away, yeah. Right away.

1:04:32.956 --> 1:04:36.084
The waggle dance
is how bees communicate.

1:04:36.126 --> 1:04:38.086
They share the information
where the flower is

1:04:38.128 --> 1:04:39.921
with the rest of the colony.

1:04:39.963 --> 1:04:43.967
They communicate
the precise location

1:04:44.009 --> 1:04:45.427
by shaking their butts.

1:04:45.468 --> 1:04:47.512
What is in that honey?

1:04:47.554 --> 1:04:49.889
WOMAN Hey, Mom,
he wants to talk to you.

1:04:49.931 --> 1:04:53.018
Hello, Mom.
Seymour Moskowitz.

1:04:53.059 --> 1:04:54.894
Right. Jewish.

1:04:54.936 --> 1:04:58.440
My mom kept bees
before she died.

1:05:00.734 --> 1:05:02.736
I'm sorry.

1:05:02.777 --> 1:05:04.446
I'm sorry, baby.

1:05:08.992 --> 1:05:11.619
And now they're
at the back door.

1:05:11.661 --> 1:05:14.789
Halloween's over, kids!

1:05:20.503 --> 1:05:22.547
I'll handle it.

1:05:32.557 --> 1:05:33.975
Knock it off!

1:05:39.397 --> 1:05:42.150
Well, now they're
at the front door.

1:05:49.157 --> 1:05:51.659
Let's scare the shit
out of these kids.

1:06:03.338 --> 1:06:05.382
John.

1:06:06.466 --> 1:06:09.010
Don't you know
whose house this was?

1:06:09.052 --> 1:06:10.679
Huh?

1:06:10.720 --> 1:06:12.764
Honey, don't do anything stupid.

1:06:12.806 --> 1:06:14.599
We don't want to get sued.

1:06:16.351 --> 1:06:18.728
I bet those bitches
are in the bushes.

1:06:20.188 --> 1:06:22.732
Did you lock the back door?

1:06:22.774 --> 1:06:24.442
Uh...

1:06:24.484 --> 1:06:25.735
I'll check.

1:06:27.737 --> 1:06:30.448
Next time, I'm coming
with a pitchfork.

1:06:45.755 --> 1:06:47.340
Big John?

1:06:48.091 --> 1:06:49.718
Big John?

1:06:53.930 --> 1:06:55.765
Yes, Little John?

1:06:57.392 --> 1:07:00.020
Someone's in our house.

1:07:00.061 --> 1:07:02.772
And it's not a child.

1:07:08.445 --> 1:07:10.780
Fuck that.

1:07:23.877 --> 1:07:26.296
I got this knife.

1:07:31.134 --> 1:07:33.428
I got this knife.

1:07:45.231 --> 1:07:47.025
-Fuck off, man.

1:07:47.067 --> 1:07:49.194
Get out of my face.

1:07:49.235 --> 1:07:50.987
Lonnie, where are you?

1:07:51.029 --> 1:07:52.781
I'm at the hospital right now.

1:07:52.822 --> 1:07:54.574
Yeah, I brought her in to E.R.

1:07:56.159 --> 1:07:58.328
Is that him?

1:07:59.537 --> 1:08:01.623
I saw that guy on TV.

1:08:01.664 --> 1:08:03.708
Back, back, back.

1:08:11.341 --> 1:08:13.009
You know what I mean?

1:08:14.761 --> 1:08:16.471
I have no answer for you.

1:08:17.472 --> 1:08:19.516
Help me.

1:08:20.850 --> 1:08:22.227
Help me!

1:08:27.273 --> 1:08:28.525
Tommy, what's happening?

1:08:28.566 --> 1:08:30.110
-I don't know.
-Who is it?

1:08:30.151 --> 1:08:31.486
Um...

1:08:31.528 --> 1:08:33.780
-Help me! -Who is it?
Is it Michael?

1:08:33.822 --> 1:08:35.740
-Is it him? -I don't know.
-It's Michael.

1:08:35.782 --> 1:08:36.991
Michael's here.

1:08:37.033 --> 1:08:38.159
He's not wearing his mask!

1:08:38.201 --> 1:08:40.245
-It's Michael.
-Michael!

1:08:40.286 --> 1:08:42.831
Michael! Stop!

1:08:44.916 --> 1:08:46.167
Stop!

1:08:46.209 --> 1:08:47.377
Mom, Mom, you're not
going near him.

1:08:47.419 --> 1:08:48.920
-I'm gonna go.
-No, you're not.

1:08:48.962 --> 1:08:50.213
Block the doorway!

1:08:50.255 --> 1:08:52.382
Don't let him leave!

1:08:52.424 --> 1:08:54.718
-He's getting away.
-Tommy, get him!

1:08:54.759 --> 1:08:56.344
Excuse me.

1:08:56.386 --> 1:08:59.347
-Evil dies tonight!

1:08:59.389 --> 1:09:00.724
-Evil dies tonight!
-Come on!

1:09:00.765 --> 1:09:04.853
Evil dies tonight!
Evil dies tonight!

1:09:04.894 --> 1:09:07.480
Evil dies tonight!

1:09:07.522 --> 1:09:10.400
Evil dies tonight!
Evil dies tonight!

1:09:10.442 --> 1:09:12.485
Evil dies tonight!

1:09:12.527 --> 1:09:16.823
Evil dies tonight!
Evil dies tonight!

1:09:19.617 --> 1:09:21.536
Little John?

1:09:22.287 --> 1:09:23.830
Big John.

1:09:23.872 --> 1:09:25.373
Yeah.

1:09:38.053 --> 1:09:40.055
Little John?

1:09:40.096 --> 1:09:41.806
Big John.

1:09:56.279 --> 1:09:59.616
Little John, the study's clear.

1:10:54.879 --> 1:10:56.840
Big John!

1:11:14.024 --> 1:11:16.026
Big John.

1:11:16.067 --> 1:11:17.318
No.

1:11:17.360 --> 1:11:19.779
Big John.

1:11:25.827 --> 1:11:27.537
Michael.

1:11:31.958 --> 1:11:34.502
You've come home.

1:11:42.302 --> 1:11:44.262
No!

1:11:54.773 --> 1:11:56.941
No, no, no, that's not...

1:11:56.983 --> 1:11:59.652
-That's not him. It's not him!
-It's not him? It's not him!

1:11:59.694 --> 1:12:01.363
-That's not Michael!
-It's not him!

1:12:01.404 --> 1:12:03.531
-It's not him! It's not him!
-Get him!

1:12:03.573 --> 1:12:04.574
It's not him!

1:12:04.616 --> 1:12:07.035
You fucking sheep, it's not him!

1:12:07.077 --> 1:12:09.788
-It's not him! It's not him!
-Get out of the way!

1:12:14.376 --> 1:12:16.378
Mom, Mom, Mom!

1:12:16.419 --> 1:12:17.420
Mom. Mom.

1:12:17.462 --> 1:12:19.339
-Mom. Mom!

1:12:19.381 --> 1:12:20.882
I got to get you out of here.

1:12:20.924 --> 1:12:22.050
Tommy!

1:12:22.092 --> 1:12:24.427
Get back here!

1:12:24.469 --> 1:12:27.389
Help! Help!

1:12:27.430 --> 1:12:30.058
Somebody help me!

1:12:32.769 --> 1:12:34.437
-Mom! Okay.

1:12:34.479 --> 1:12:36.731
Okay. Okay, be careful.

1:12:38.191 --> 1:12:40.151
-I got it, Sheriff.
-You're gonna be okay.

1:12:40.193 --> 1:12:41.569
-- Come on.
-- Get him!

1:12:41.611 --> 1:12:42.946
-- It's not him.
-- I know, Mom.

1:12:42.987 --> 1:12:45.115
I got her. I got her.
Go, go, go.

1:12:45.156 --> 1:12:46.783
-It's... not him.
-Your arm.

1:12:46.825 --> 1:12:48.535
-All right, let's get her...
-They're after the wrong guy.

1:12:48.576 --> 1:12:50.537
-Let's get her into bed.
-It's not him. It's not Michael.

1:13:02.757 --> 1:13:04.926
-Get out of the way!

1:13:04.968 --> 1:13:07.095
Okay, Mom. Come on.

1:13:07.137 --> 1:13:08.596
-We got you.

1:13:08.638 --> 1:13:10.015
All right, gentle. Careful.

1:13:10.056 --> 1:13:12.100
-Careful. I can handle this.

1:13:12.142 --> 1:13:14.185
Be careful of your head.

1:13:14.227 --> 1:13:16.271
Okay. All right.

1:13:16.312 --> 1:13:17.355
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1:13:17.397 --> 1:13:18.898
All right, look, stay here.

1:13:18.940 --> 1:13:20.734
There's gonna be guards
outside the door, all right?

1:13:20.775 --> 1:13:22.444
-Be careful. -I'm gonna get
a nurse to get you

1:13:22.485 --> 1:13:23.820
-all hooked up again, okay?
-You be careful.

1:13:23.862 --> 1:13:25.780
Hospital staff sightings
on the second floor.

1:13:28.867 --> 1:13:31.119
Please stop!

1:13:31.161 --> 1:13:33.663
Please! It's not Michael!

1:13:33.705 --> 1:13:35.123
You don't know
what he looks like!

1:13:35.165 --> 1:13:37.167
We're in the stairwell. Move!

1:13:37.208 --> 1:13:39.753
Watch it, asshole. Karen.

1:13:39.794 --> 1:13:42.672
You okay?
Here, move over to the side.

1:13:43.590 --> 1:13:45.133
To the side with them.
Careful, careful.

1:13:45.175 --> 1:13:46.801
-He's up there!
-Stop! It's not him!

1:13:46.843 --> 1:13:49.012
-Get out of my way!
-Tommy, stop! Chill out.

1:13:49.054 --> 1:13:51.014
Get a grip, Tommy!

1:13:51.056 --> 1:13:53.266
Get the fuck out of the way!

1:13:53.308 --> 1:13:56.353
-Knock it off!

1:13:58.855 --> 1:14:00.899
-Tommy!

1:14:00.940 --> 1:14:02.650
We're gonna kill him!

1:14:02.692 --> 1:14:04.152
CROWD
Evil dies tonight!

1:14:04.194 --> 1:14:07.155
-It's all happening.

1:14:07.197 --> 1:14:09.866
Michael's masterpiece.

1:14:09.908 --> 1:14:12.911
He created this chaos, but...

1:14:12.952 --> 1:14:16.539
I'm the one that brought it all
onto Haddonfield.

1:14:16.581 --> 1:14:19.918
I could have made
all this go away.

1:14:21.002 --> 1:14:24.631
It was that night
that you were attacked.

1:14:24.673 --> 1:14:27.133
It's not your fault.

1:14:27.175 --> 1:14:29.552
It's mine.

1:14:33.848 --> 1:14:35.975
It was an accident.

1:14:36.851 --> 1:14:40.105
I was lost in my own regret.

1:14:40.146 --> 1:14:41.648
Did Michael kill again?

1:14:41.690 --> 1:14:44.442
I saw the look

1:14:44.484 --> 1:14:46.778
in Loomis's eyes.

1:14:46.820 --> 1:14:50.198
All he wanted was more blood.

1:14:51.449 --> 1:14:53.451
More death.

1:14:53.493 --> 1:14:55.036
And I couldn't take it.

1:14:55.078 --> 1:14:57.205
And then in that moment,
all I could think was that

1:14:57.247 --> 1:15:00.667
inside that monster,
there was somebody's baby boy.

1:15:02.085 --> 1:15:05.588
Purely and simply evil.

1:15:05.630 --> 1:15:08.550
No! Don't!

1:15:08.591 --> 1:15:11.803
I could have made
all this go away.

1:15:11.845 --> 1:15:15.181
It's not your fault.

1:15:15.223 --> 1:15:17.434
It's mine.

1:15:17.475 --> 1:15:19.769
But now I know...

1:15:21.021 --> 1:15:25.650
...there's nothing
inside that man but pure evil.

1:15:25.692 --> 1:15:27.777
It's not just Michael.

1:15:27.819 --> 1:15:30.989
It's what he's done
to this town, these people.

1:15:32.115 --> 1:15:34.409
Decent people.

1:15:34.451 --> 1:15:36.244
You're a good man, Frank.

1:15:36.286 --> 1:15:37.829
You were doing your job.

1:15:37.871 --> 1:15:40.749
But now it needs to die.

1:15:40.790 --> 1:15:44.627
'Cause every time
somebody's afraid,

1:15:44.669 --> 1:15:47.088
the Boogeyman wins.

1:15:47.130 --> 1:15:50.592
It needs to die.

1:15:50.633 --> 1:15:54.846
And I'm the one
that needs to kill it.

1:16:22.749 --> 1:16:24.417
It's not you.

1:16:24.459 --> 1:16:26.336
I know it's not you.

1:16:28.463 --> 1:16:30.674
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1:16:40.350 --> 1:16:42.352
I know you're scared.

1:16:43.478 --> 1:16:45.355
They're scared, too.

1:16:48.358 --> 1:16:50.985
I'm not gonna let them hurt you.

1:17:09.379 --> 1:17:11.006
Okay.

1:17:11.047 --> 1:17:13.842
-Okay. I know. I know.

1:17:13.883 --> 1:17:16.594
I'm gonna help you.
I'm gonna help you.

1:17:16.636 --> 1:17:18.304
Okay, come on. Come on.

1:17:20.390 --> 1:17:21.725
Let go of my hand.

1:17:21.766 --> 1:17:23.018
That's good.

1:17:23.059 --> 1:17:24.728
I'm gonna lock these doors.

1:17:27.564 --> 1:17:28.690
Okay.

1:17:28.732 --> 1:17:30.400
Okay. Lock this behind me.

1:17:31.526 --> 1:17:33.069
They're coming.

1:17:33.737 --> 1:17:35.196
They're coming.

1:17:35.238 --> 1:17:37.490
-Come on!

1:17:45.874 --> 1:17:47.959
I'm not gonna let them hurt you.

1:17:51.338 --> 1:17:52.464
It's him.

1:17:52.505 --> 1:17:54.758
Get him! Get him!

1:18:23.495 --> 1:18:25.413
Evil dies tonight!

1:18:25.455 --> 1:18:26.664
Evil dies tonight!

1:18:26.706 --> 1:18:29.793
-Evil dies tonight!

1:18:40.428 --> 1:18:42.347
Evil dies tonight!

1:18:45.183 --> 1:18:49.854
Evil dies tonight!
Evil dies tonight!

1:18:52.148 --> 1:18:53.775
Stop them!

1:18:53.817 --> 1:18:55.568
It's not him?

1:19:35.900 --> 1:19:38.528
-Move!
-Evil dies tonight!

1:19:38.570 --> 1:19:40.321
Evil dies tonight!

1:19:42.741 --> 1:19:44.367
-- Oh, my God.
-- He's dead.

1:19:46.536 --> 1:19:48.329
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

1:19:48.371 --> 1:19:50.331
Evil dies tonight!

1:19:58.840 --> 1:20:01.509
Leigh! Leigh!

1:20:01.551 --> 1:20:03.762
No. It's not him.

1:20:03.803 --> 1:20:06.014
It's not him, Tommy.

1:20:07.015 --> 1:20:09.517
He's always worn a mask.
How do we know it's not him?

1:20:09.559 --> 1:20:11.019
How do we know, Leigh?

1:20:18.360 --> 1:20:22.238
Now he's turning us
into monsters.

1:20:50.100 --> 1:20:52.310
I swear I was just trying
to do the right thing.

1:20:53.311 --> 1:20:54.688
Look at me.

1:20:58.608 --> 1:21:01.569
What I'm thinking is
the killer was choking him,

1:21:01.611 --> 1:21:03.738
Pete went for his gun.

1:21:03.780 --> 1:21:06.700
As he pulled it up, it went off.

1:21:08.910 --> 1:21:11.037
Give me your gun.

1:21:11.871 --> 1:21:13.206
Don't look at it.

1:21:13.248 --> 1:21:16.001
Just be cool
and give me your gun.

1:21:16.042 --> 1:21:18.086
Take this.

1:21:18.128 --> 1:21:19.921
It was an accident.

1:21:19.963 --> 1:21:21.589
He shot himself.

1:21:21.631 --> 1:21:23.299
Got it?

1:21:24.134 --> 1:21:25.427
Just because
your intentions are good

1:21:25.468 --> 1:21:27.637
doesn't mean things
always work out.

1:21:30.515 --> 1:21:32.100
I stood in the way.

1:21:32.142 --> 1:21:34.102
It was me.

1:21:34.144 --> 1:21:36.604
-It wasn't him.
-Let me find him, then.

1:21:36.646 --> 1:21:38.106
He's after me.

1:21:38.148 --> 1:21:39.899
No, he's not.

1:21:39.941 --> 1:21:41.443
Frank.

1:21:41.484 --> 1:21:44.237
-He's not.

1:21:44.279 --> 1:21:46.614
It was the doctor that took him
to your house tonight.

1:21:46.656 --> 1:21:47.991
It wasn't Michael.

1:21:48.033 --> 1:21:50.326
It's not about you.

1:21:51.411 --> 1:21:53.121
-Doctor, get back in the car!
-No!

1:21:53.163 --> 1:21:55.290
I'm still gonna blow
this motherfucker's brains out.

1:21:56.624 --> 1:21:58.668
Mom! Mom!

1:21:59.753 --> 1:22:00.920
Help!

1:22:02.297 --> 1:22:05.133
He's a six-year-old boy
with the strength of a man

1:22:05.175 --> 1:22:06.885
and the mind of an animal.

1:22:06.926 --> 1:22:09.054
I know. I've seen his face.

1:22:09.095 --> 1:22:12.307
I looked in his eyes
when I took off his mask.

1:22:12.349 --> 1:22:14.642
Did you know that
when he was a little boy

1:22:14.684 --> 1:22:17.937
he used to stand
in his sister's bedroom and...

1:22:17.979 --> 1:22:20.148
stare out the window?

1:22:20.190 --> 1:22:22.275
My partner died

1:22:22.317 --> 1:22:24.903
the night he stood
on that same spot.

1:22:24.944 --> 1:22:27.113
But for an instant,

1:22:27.155 --> 1:22:30.367
before his death, he knew.

1:22:30.408 --> 1:22:33.161
Maybe he wasn't looking out.

1:22:34.579 --> 1:22:36.623
Maybe he was looking in.

1:22:38.208 --> 1:22:39.959
At his reflection.

1:22:40.001 --> 1:22:41.795
At himself.

1:22:42.712 --> 1:22:46.383
Who knows what makes him kill,
what motivates him?

1:22:46.424 --> 1:22:51.721
But in his heart,
it always seemed to me

1:22:51.763 --> 1:22:54.641
he wants one thing.

1:22:54.683 --> 1:22:57.268
He's going home.

1:22:57.310 --> 1:22:59.312
-He went from Laurie's
compound... -Mm-hmm.

1:22:59.354 --> 1:23:01.189
...the victims
in her neighborhood,

1:23:01.231 --> 1:23:02.899
to the park, okay?

1:23:02.941 --> 1:23:05.902
If you track those locations,
that's a straight line,

1:23:05.944 --> 1:23:08.029
basically an arrow
pointing straight

1:23:08.071 --> 1:23:11.449
to Lampkin Lane,
Michael's childhood home.

1:23:11.491 --> 1:23:15.412
I came face-to-face with
this asshole when I was a kid.

1:23:15.453 --> 1:23:19.582
He creeps, he kills,
he goes home.

1:23:23.086 --> 1:23:25.714
Then that's where we're going.

1:23:25.755 --> 1:23:27.424
Yeah.

1:23:34.931 --> 1:23:36.808
Karen. Karen.

1:23:36.850 --> 1:23:38.059
Listen, I'm sorry.

1:23:38.101 --> 1:23:39.602
You were right, okay?
I'm sorry.

1:23:39.644 --> 1:23:42.731
Tommy, you took my daughter
to chase a killer,

1:23:42.772 --> 1:23:44.774
and an innocent man is dead.

1:23:44.816 --> 1:23:46.901
Fuck it.
None of us are innocent.

1:23:46.943 --> 1:23:49.112
Karen, listen. Listen.
I fucked up.

1:23:49.154 --> 1:23:50.613
I fucked up. I'm sorry.

1:23:50.655 --> 1:23:52.323
So, what now?

1:23:52.365 --> 1:23:54.701
You're sorry? You're just gonna
stand here hating yourself?

1:23:54.743 --> 1:23:55.869
No.

1:23:55.910 --> 1:23:57.912
I got to keep trying.

1:23:57.954 --> 1:23:59.414
But if I go down,

1:23:59.456 --> 1:24:01.875
I'm gonna go down swinging.

1:24:04.753 --> 1:24:06.629
I need a car.

1:24:07.630 --> 1:24:09.341
I have a car.

1:24:29.069 --> 1:24:31.780
Okay, so the key is
we stick together.

1:24:31.821 --> 1:24:33.448
No, I'm going in alone.

1:24:33.490 --> 1:24:35.116
-What?
-Mr. Elam.

1:24:35.158 --> 1:24:36.993
You fucking dummy,
you brought your kid

1:24:37.035 --> 1:24:38.870
-to the belly of the beast.
-Dad, no.

1:24:38.912 --> 1:24:40.538
Mr. Elam, with all due respect,

1:24:40.580 --> 1:24:42.791
you really expect me
to sit here while you go inside

1:24:42.832 --> 1:24:44.793
and confront the man
that killed my father?

1:24:44.834 --> 1:24:47.212
No, I don't expect you to.

1:24:47.253 --> 1:24:49.464
But I'm asking, Allyson.

1:24:49.506 --> 1:24:51.800
For your sake and my son's.

1:24:51.841 --> 1:24:54.636
Okay? Just stay here.

1:24:54.678 --> 1:24:59.140
You see anything suspicious,
you honk the horn, all right?

1:24:59.182 --> 1:25:01.476
But you stay safe.

1:25:01.518 --> 1:25:03.269
All right?

1:25:07.691 --> 1:25:10.402
I will see you
at the finish line, buddy.

1:26:06.666 --> 1:26:08.251
Okay.

1:26:16.343 --> 1:26:19.304
This is so fucked up.

1:26:23.600 --> 1:26:26.811
-Cameron, let's go.

1:26:26.853 --> 1:26:28.813
Come on.

1:26:28.855 --> 1:26:29.939
Go, go, go, go!

1:26:38.323 --> 1:26:40.700
Okay.

1:26:51.127 --> 1:26:52.879
Dad?

1:27:03.139 --> 1:27:04.766
CAMERON
Allyson.

1:27:04.808 --> 1:27:06.643
Over there.

1:29:39.004 --> 1:29:40.839
Dad.

1:29:45.885 --> 1:29:46.636
Cameron?

1:30:13.496 --> 1:30:15.915
Allyson!

1:30:15.957 --> 1:30:16.958
Cameron!

1:30:25.091 --> 1:30:26.968
Cameron!

1:30:28.219 --> 1:30:29.679
No!

1:30:30.388 --> 1:30:34.017
-Cameron! No!

1:30:35.101 --> 1:30:36.311
Cameron!

1:30:37.604 --> 1:30:39.230
ALLYSON
No.

1:30:39.272 --> 1:30:41.149
No, no, no, no!

1:30:41.191 --> 1:30:43.026
-No!

1:30:43.068 --> 1:30:45.111
-Allyson!
-No!

1:30:48.656 --> 1:30:51.159
Come and get me, motherfucker!

1:30:51.201 --> 1:30:53.286
Come and get me.

1:31:24.192 --> 1:31:25.318
Leave him alone!

1:31:27.070 --> 1:31:28.613
No.

1:31:28.655 --> 1:31:30.490
No. No!

1:31:30.532 --> 1:31:32.867
-No!

1:31:37.038 --> 1:31:38.748
No!

1:31:51.219 --> 1:31:53.763
Do it. Do it.

1:31:54.556 --> 1:31:56.016
Do it!

1:32:16.202 --> 1:32:17.871
Mom.

1:32:31.009 --> 1:32:32.969
Mom.

1:32:39.476 --> 1:32:40.769
No, Mom.

1:32:40.810 --> 1:32:42.270
You want your mask?

1:32:42.312 --> 1:32:43.730
Come and get it!

1:32:43.772 --> 1:32:46.608
You want to fucking
kill someone, take me!

1:32:46.649 --> 1:32:49.319
Mom. No, Mom.

1:32:52.614 --> 1:32:54.574
I'm an innocent woman,

1:32:54.616 --> 1:32:56.618
just like your sister was.

1:32:56.659 --> 1:32:58.661
It was Halloween night.

1:32:58.703 --> 1:33:00.580
She was in her bedroom.

1:33:00.622 --> 1:33:02.791
And it was right here.

1:33:02.832 --> 1:33:04.709
Your house.

1:33:04.751 --> 1:33:07.629
Can't you feel it?

1:33:07.671 --> 1:33:09.631
ALLYSON
No. No, Mom.

1:33:12.717 --> 1:33:14.803
Mom, no.

1:33:21.935 --> 1:33:24.688
Mom!

1:34:03.059 --> 1:34:04.894
Gotcha.

1:34:16.531 --> 1:34:18.491
Hey, Michael.

1:34:18.533 --> 1:34:20.118
It's Halloween.

1:34:20.160 --> 1:34:23.288
Everyone's entitled
to one good scare.

1:35:04.162 --> 1:35:07.374
-- Light him up.
-- Let's take him.

1:35:48.665 --> 1:35:50.250
We got this, Karen.

1:35:51.668 --> 1:35:53.920
Go be with your daughter.

1:36:17.902 --> 1:36:19.904
I always thought Michael Myers

1:36:19.946 --> 1:36:23.992
was flesh and blood,
just like you and me,

1:36:24.034 --> 1:36:25.869
but a mortal man
could not have survived

1:36:25.910 --> 1:36:27.412
what he's lived through.

1:36:28.621 --> 1:36:30.749
The more he kills,

1:36:30.790 --> 1:36:32.500
the more he transcends

1:36:32.542 --> 1:36:36.171
into something else
impossible to defeat.

1:36:36.212 --> 1:36:37.881
Fear.

1:36:37.922 --> 1:36:39.883
People are afraid.

1:36:39.924 --> 1:36:43.261
That is the true curse
of Michael.

1:36:43.303 --> 1:36:46.014
He'll always be here, won't he?

1:36:46.056 --> 1:36:48.224
Even when we can't see him.

1:36:54.272 --> 1:36:56.566
You can't defeat it
with brute force.

1:36:58.068 --> 1:37:01.196
If we only knew then
what we know now.

1:37:39.317 --> 1:37:41.569
It is the essence of evil.

1:37:43.655 --> 1:37:45.573
The anchor that divides us.

1:37:46.908 --> 1:37:50.620
It is the terror that grows
stronger when we try to hide.

1:38:23.903 --> 1:38:26.448
If they don't stop him tonight,

1:38:26.489 --> 1:38:28.783
maybe we'll find him tomorrow.

1:38:28.825 --> 1:38:30.368
Or next Halloween,

1:38:30.410 --> 1:38:34.039
when the sun sets
and someone is alone.

1:39:10.575 --> 1:39:14.162
You can't close your eyes
and pretend he isn't there.

1:39:19.209 --> 1:39:21.503
Because he is.
