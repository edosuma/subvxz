Danny.

00:48.381 --> 00:49.882
Danny, we have to have
a little talk.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.383
Yeah, what's up, Burt?

00:51.384 --> 00:52.885
You got this whole town
in an uproar.

00:52.886 --> 00:56.355
Forty-two tickets
for tailgating?

00:56.356 --> 00:58.157
You should've seen that mess.

00:58.158 --> 01:00.025
It was a potential nightmare.

01:00.026 --> 01:01.960
They can't help it
if they're bumper to bumper.

01:01.961 --> 01:03.429
It's rush hour!

01:04.431 --> 01:07.900
I don't make the laws.
I just enforce them.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.402
Danny, look, please, if you
wanna ride shotgun for me,

01:10.403 --> 01:13.772
you gotta have something
in the barrel.

01:13.773 --> 01:17.076
"You gotta have something
in the barrel."

01:17.077 --> 01:18.077
I love that.

01:19.412 --> 01:20.913
No, Danny, please,
I'm talking about,

01:20.914 --> 01:23.415
you have to learn
how to interpret the law.

01:23.416 --> 01:26.418
All right, now for example, say
somebody does something wrong.

01:26.419 --> 01:28.420
Not a lot wrong, a little wrong.

01:28.421 --> 01:31.356
Now, suppose the wrong-doer
is a right guy.

01:31.357 --> 01:34.326
Well, now, there's a fine line
between right and wrong.

01:34.327 --> 01:36.161
And sometimes,
you have to let a person have

01:36.162 --> 01:38.497
the right to be wrong.

01:38.498 --> 01:41.467
Am I right, or am I wrong?

01:41.468 --> 01:43.470
Absolutely.

01:46.439 --> 01:47.940
Now, listen to this, Burt.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.942
I'm afraid to.

01:49.943 --> 01:53.445
Fact. There have been two
murders in the last four years

01:53.446 --> 01:55.447
in Dunn's River. Fact!

01:55.448 --> 01:58.217
Both of those murders
have gone unsolved.

01:58.218 --> 01:59.718
What is the point?

01:59.719 --> 02:01.220
Don't you see?

02:01.221 --> 02:03.722
The writing's on the wall.

02:03.723 --> 02:07.059
Those victims were killed
in the same place.

02:07.060 --> 02:09.527
Danny, what are you
talking about?

02:09.529 --> 02:11.463
Sam Ogilvie
was killed on North Street.

02:11.464 --> 02:12.965
Old Man Jennings,
they found on Melrose.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.967
How can you tell me
that they were killed

02:14.968 --> 02:15.968
in the same place?

02:15.969 --> 02:18.471
Look at the map.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.374
There's North...

02:22.375 --> 02:27.279
and there's Melrose.

02:27.280 --> 02:31.651
Those murders took place
less than an inch apart.

02:37.123 --> 02:38.123
Hello, Burt.

02:38.124 --> 02:39.625
Oh, Chester, Dutch,

02:39.626 --> 02:40.626
how you doing?

02:40.627 --> 02:43.128
Fine, just fine.

02:43.129 --> 02:45.130
Look, if you guys are here
to see your parole officer,

02:45.131 --> 02:46.632
Wally's not here on Tuesdays.

02:46.633 --> 02:48.000
That's not why we're here.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.001
We wanna make a deal.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.936
Shut up, Dutch.

02:50.937 --> 02:52.437
Burt...

02:52.438 --> 02:54.873
You're one heck of a guy.

02:54.874 --> 02:56.375

What do you want, Chester?

03:05.218 --> 03:06.118
I beg your pardon?

03:06.119 --> 03:07.553
What do you want, Chester?

03:07.554 --> 03:09.288
Burt, I'm taken back.

03:09.289 --> 03:10.689
What do you want, Chester?

03:10.690 --> 03:12.658
What could I possibly want?

03:12.659 --> 03:14.660
We wanna buy your
construction company.

03:14.661 --> 03:16.662
Would you put a lid on it?

03:16.663 --> 03:20.165
Burt, because you're
one heck of a guy,

03:20.166 --> 03:21.667
Dutch and I are willing

03:21.668 --> 03:24.603
to take Campbell & Son
Construction off your hands.

Chester welding girders

03:29.609 --> 03:31.610
in a three-piece suit, eh?

03:31.611 --> 03:33.613
[LAUGHTER]

03:35.114 --> 03:37.583
I don't weld girders.

03:37.584 --> 03:39.418
That's what I have Dutch for.

03:39.419 --> 03:41.787
I'll be busy keeping my eye
on the cash flow.

03:41.788 --> 03:44.790
Ooo-hoo-hoo!

03:44.791 --> 03:47.192
Chester, you're an embezzler.

03:47.193 --> 03:50.495
Burt, this is no time
to nitpick.

03:50.496 --> 03:54.499
Burt, do you remember when we
had the big blizzard,

03:54.500 --> 03:56.501
and I had Benson
dig your car out?

03:56.502 --> 03:58.003
Mm-hm.

03:58.004 --> 03:59.004
Will ya give me the company?

03:59.005 --> 04:00.005
No, that's...

04:00.006 --> 04:02.007
I don't think so, Chester.

04:02.008 --> 04:03.008
Burt, Burt, Burt.

04:03.009 --> 04:05.010
I think that you will find
this bid sufficient.

I don't know...

04:09.015 --> 04:11.516

04:11.517 --> 04:14.019
Tirali Construction Company
offered us double that.

04:14.020 --> 04:15.520
We'll triple it!

04:15.521 --> 04:16.521
Blithering idiot!

04:16.522 --> 04:18.023
What are you yelling at me for?

04:18.024 --> 04:19.024
You said it's worth five times

04:19.024 --> 04:20.024
what we're offering 'em.

04:20.026 --> 04:21.961
Have you heard
from your brain lately?

04:23.896 --> 04:26.398
Wait a minute, guys.
Come on, relax.

04:26.399 --> 04:27.899
I don't know if I wanna sell.

04:27.900 --> 04:29.401
I mean, for a couple of reasons.

04:29.402 --> 04:32.404
For one thing, I'm not gonna
be wearing this badge forever,

04:32.405 --> 04:34.906
and secondly, something
you don't understand is,

04:34.907 --> 04:36.408
it's my company.

04:36.409 --> 04:38.844
I worked my whole life
to have my name mean something.

04:38.845 --> 04:43.149
And today, all the name
Campbell means, is... soup.

04:45.118 --> 04:48.120
Burt, you'll still retain...
20 percent of the company.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.121
I don't think so.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.622
40 percent!

one of your pistols?

05:15.014 --> 05:16.515
I am very skeptical.

05:16.516 --> 05:17.516
What do you think?

05:17.517 --> 05:19.852
About what?

05:21.354 --> 05:25.857
My partner and I have conferred,
and we think this idea

05:25.858 --> 05:27.859
is a ridiculous idea.

05:27.860 --> 05:30.362
Very well. If that's
the way you feel about it,

05:30.363 --> 05:31.863
I'm certainly not going to beg.

05:31.864 --> 05:32.865
Come along, Dutch.

Oh, Burt, please!

You're making a fool
of yourself.

what you're thinking,

05:48.381 --> 05:49.381
that I'm a murderer, right?

No, I can live with that.

05:50.883 --> 05:51.883
Ditto.

05:51.884 --> 05:53.385
That I escaped from prison?

Don't be silly.

05:54.387 --> 05:55.887
Psshh.

05:55.888 --> 05:57.889
That Chester is a lowlife.

Well...

05:58.891 --> 06:01.893
Shut up.

for a break

06:04.330 --> 06:05.831
that I don't deserve.

06:05.832 --> 06:07.766
But I'm turning my life around.

I got a wife now,
and I wanna have a family.

06:11.237 --> 06:12.738
This is my only shot, Burt,

06:12.739 --> 06:14.206
and I'm gonna make good on it.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.207
I give ya my word.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.710
Come on, Dutch, please.
I don't want...

06:18.711 --> 06:20.212
I'm in a very funny
position here.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.714
Chester... eh?

06:22.715 --> 06:24.716
I'd like to confer
with my associate again.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.218
Absolutely, confer.

I mean that.

06:28.688 --> 06:29.688
Thank you.

I told you this would be
a piece of cake.

06:35.194 --> 06:37.195
I just... I don't
trust him.

06:37.196 --> 06:38.196
I know he means well,

06:38.197 --> 06:40.699
and I know we could keep
an eye on him, but still...

06:40.700 --> 06:42.200
You know what I mean?

06:42.201 --> 06:43.702
Uh-huh.

06:43.703 --> 06:45.203
But your mother,
she'd never forgive me

06:45.204 --> 06:47.072
if I let this poor guy
go on to welfare.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.577
Yeah, Chester.

06:52.578 --> 06:56.081
But he's a crook.
He's an embezzler.

06:56.082 --> 06:58.583
But he's family.

06:58.584 --> 06:59.584
Do you know what I mean?

06:59.585 --> 07:02.321
Not at all.

Oh, Chester, don't do that.

07:16.335 --> 07:19.337
All right, now, on one
condition here, Dutch.

07:19.338 --> 07:20.338
You're the president.

07:20.339 --> 07:21.339
It's a deal.

07:27.346 --> 07:28.347
Chester, pay him.

07:30.850 --> 07:32.351
All right.

07:34.754 --> 07:37.156
This is an I-owe-you.

I-owe-you? You're not gonna
pay me anything?

07:41.060 --> 07:42.027
What, you're serious?

07:42.028 --> 07:43.528
Where would I get
that kind of money?

Hey, Burt,

07:45.031 --> 07:46.031
don't worry.

07:46.032 --> 07:48.533
We ain't got the money yet,
but... we'll earn it.

07:48.534 --> 07:50.035
That's right!

07:50.036 --> 07:52.037
Come on, Dutch, let's
get down to the pier

07:52.038 --> 07:53.038
and get that steel shipment.

07:53.039 --> 07:55.040
Whoa, wait.
What steel shipment?

07:55.041 --> 07:57.042
The cheap stuff from Hong Kong.

07:57.043 --> 07:58.543
The buildings will look
the same.

08:47.127 --> 08:50.061
Well, at least
let me take one oar,

08:50.062 --> 08:53.565
and I'll sit beside you
for a while.

while you were sleeping,

09:00.573 --> 09:02.073
my little chilly pepper.

09:02.074 --> 09:06.077
El, think we could just
dip into our food supply again?

two breath mints left.

09:09.081 --> 09:11.082
I see...

Well, could we just
have a little sip of water?

09:13.586 --> 09:16.588
The canteen, she is empty.

09:16.589 --> 09:17.589
She is?
Yeah.

Oh, El, why didn't
we plan this better?

09:21.594 --> 09:24.596
We should've had a big yacht
standing by, you know,

09:24.597 --> 09:26.598
just in case
the revolution failed.

09:26.599 --> 09:28.099
Oh, no, no.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.101
That would be negative thinking.

09:30.102 --> 09:31.102
Uh, true.

09:31.103 --> 09:34.105
But we would've had
food and water,

09:34.106 --> 09:36.608

some warm clothes.

If I don't like a guy,
I don't take him on.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.006
You don't believe me, do you?

20:09.007 --> 20:12.510
Hey, it's no concern of mine
how you make your living.

20:12.511 --> 20:16.013
I think you're jealous.

20:16.014 --> 20:19.016
Jealous! Ha!

20:19.017 --> 20:22.520
Oh, that's funny.
Very, very funny.

20:22.521 --> 20:23.521
Jealous.

20:23.522 --> 20:25.022
[LAUGHS]

20:25.023 --> 20:27.525
Me, jealous?

20:27.526 --> 20:29.527
Boy, that's a laugh.

20:29.528 --> 20:32.464
I'm laughin'. Ha.

20:33.465 --> 20:35.733
Do you wanna make love to me?

20:38.237 --> 20:40.739
I'm a cop, Gwen.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.742
I'm a good cop.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.577
I'm honest. I'm clean.

20:46.578 --> 20:49.447
I try and make this town
safe for everyone.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.317
Yes.

20:53.318 --> 20:55.286
Okay.

20:57.289 --> 20:59.790
But I can't.

20:59.791 --> 21:03.127
Look, could you just promise me
to shut down operations

21:03.128 --> 21:05.063
until this whole thing
blows over?

21:05.998 --> 21:09.000
You're the first guy
who ever asked me not to do

21:09.001 --> 21:10.502
what they normally pay me to do.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.004
Promise me.

21:14.473 --> 21:16.974
Okay, I promise.

21:16.975 --> 21:19.477
I won't hook
until you say it's okay.

21:19.478 --> 21:21.479
[SIGHS] Great.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.481
That's a big load off my mind.

21:23.482 --> 21:25.983
You really do?

21:25.984 --> 21:27.485
What?

21:27.486 --> 21:28.986
Wanna make love?

21:28.987 --> 21:32.923
Yeah, but I can't.

21:32.924 --> 21:35.426
I mean, I can.

21:37.863 --> 21:41.699
I just, uh... won't,
ya know?

21:41.700 --> 21:42.700
No.

21:42.701 --> 21:45.703
You see, I would be
committing a crime.

21:45.704 --> 21:46.704
I'm a cop.

21:46.705 --> 21:49.707
Yeah, I would have to arrest
myself, and frankly,

21:49.708 --> 21:51.208
I don't think I could do it.

21:51.209 --> 21:54.145
You know, knowing me, I'd
probably try and set an example,

21:54.146 --> 21:56.648
and I'd throw the book at me,
and then where would I be?

22:04.656 --> 22:08.159
I could just
give me a reprimand.

22:09.961 --> 22:13.464
