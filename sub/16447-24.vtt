00:00.001 --> 00:03.635
<i> Previously on</i>
the big bang theory...

00:03.637 --> 00:07.272
I was offered a summer research
fellowship at Princeton.

00:08.975 --> 00:10.976
Princeton.

00:10.978 --> 00:12.811
A fine institution.

00:14.180 --> 00:16.347
The place where
Albert Einstein taught,

00:16.350 --> 00:18.417
and where Leonard got his phd,

00:18.419 --> 00:20.953
so it may have gone downhill.

00:22.255 --> 00:24.423
And just remember,
I'm proud of you.

00:24.425 --> 00:26.625
And I support you
in all that you do.

00:26.627 --> 00:27.826
Thank you.

00:27.828 --> 00:28.994
That means a lot.

00:28.996 --> 00:30.229
Oh, and one last thing.

00:30.231 --> 00:32.898
If you find yourself
working with a male scientist,

00:32.900 --> 00:35.801
who's as smart as
me, as tall as me,

00:35.803 --> 00:37.336
and has hair like Thor,

00:37.338 --> 00:39.772
well, then, I want you to
step away from the situation

00:39.774 --> 00:41.774
and call me immediately.

00:44.144 --> 00:46.078
How are you settling in?

00:46.080 --> 00:47.479
Amy:
Pretty well.

00:47.481 --> 00:49.481
Princeton has
a beautiful campus.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.316
Now, I've learned some fun facts
about New Jersey

00:51.318 --> 00:52.885
to help you make small talk.

00:52.887 --> 00:54.253
Would you like to know

00:54.255 --> 00:57.322
the state bird
or the murder rate?

00:58.091 --> 00:59.925
They're both shocking.

01:01.327 --> 01:03.328
Actually, I want to hear
about you.

01:03.330 --> 01:04.797
How are things at home?

01:04.799 --> 01:07.800
Well, I'm a lot less likely
to see an eastern goldfinch

01:07.802 --> 01:09.868
or be murdered,
I'll tell you that.

01:11.237 --> 01:12.771
I miss you.

01:12.773 --> 01:12.771
I miss you, too.

01:12.773 --> 01:16.041
It's so strange, earlier today
i ended a sentence

01:16.043 --> 01:17.609
with a preposition

01:17.611 --> 01:20.546
and you weren't there
to correct my grammar.

01:20.548 --> 01:23.749
I'm sorry you had
to go through that.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.684
In fact,

01:25.686 --> 01:28.754
that's when
i started to really miss you.

01:30.156 --> 01:33.158
You know you just split
an infinitive.

01:33.160 --> 01:36.028
Did I?

01:36.030 --> 01:38.664
Are you gonna teach me a lesson?

01:40.600 --> 01:42.034
I am.

01:43.436 --> 01:44.903
It is naughty to put an adverb

01:44.905 --> 01:48.507
between the word "to"
and the verb stem.

01:48.509 --> 01:51.043
What are you gonna do about it?

01:51.045 --> 01:54.213
I'm going to admonish you.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.715
Vigorously?

01:56.717 --> 02:01.520
That's the only kind
of admonishing I do.

02:01.522 --> 02:04.823
¶ Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ¶

02:04.825 --> 02:08.393
¶ then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... wait! ¶

02:08.395 --> 02:10.027
¶ the earth began to cool ¶

02:10.030 --> 02:12.998
¶ the autotrophs began to drool,
neanderthals developed tools ¶

02:13.000 --> 02:14.800
¶ we built the wall ¶
¶<i> we built the pyramids</i> ¶

02:14.802 --> 02:17.703
¶ math, science, history,
unraveling the mystery ¶

02:17.705 --> 02:20.072
¶ that all started
with a big bang ¶

02:20.074 --> 02:21.807
¶<i> bang!</i> ¶

02:26.713 --> 02:28.313
how's Sheldon doing
with Amy gone?

02:28.315 --> 02:29.715
Well, the last three nights

02:29.717 --> 02:31.950
I've had to take him
to get a haircut,

02:31.952 --> 02:34.620
to the train store,
and to a walgreens in arcadia

02:34.622 --> 02:38.690
where they still have
the "good ibuprofen."

02:38.692 --> 02:41.360
Now ask me how I'm doing
with Amy gone.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.762
How are you doing with...
Shut up.

02:43.764 --> 02:47.099
If you'd like,
we can help you out.

02:47.101 --> 02:48.433
Oh, that would be great.

02:48.435 --> 02:49.868
I mean, not me,
I've got a wife and child,

02:49.870 --> 02:53.505
but this one posts video of
himself flossing on instagram.

02:54.874 --> 02:56.975
It was a tutorial.

02:58.111 --> 03:00.579
And yes, I'm happy to keep
Sheldon company.

03:00.581 --> 03:03.348
Great. Tonight he wants to
look at ladders at home depot.

03:03.350 --> 03:04.516
Oh, why does he need a ladder?

03:04.518 --> 03:06.151
He doesn't; He just
likes looking at them.

03:06.153 --> 03:07.986
Bring a book.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.354
Gentlemen.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.889
You may remember Dr. nowitzki,

03:10.891 --> 03:13.458
she's back at Caltech
for her postdoc.

03:13.460 --> 03:14.560
Hello.
Hello.
Hi.

03:14.562 --> 03:15.994
Oh, let me bring
a chair for you.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.296
Oh, thanks.

03:17.298 --> 03:18.497
Dr. nowitzki's
going to tell me

03:18.499 --> 03:20.032
about the work
she did at cern.

03:20.034 --> 03:23.936
And she brought me this
duty-free toblerone.

03:23.938 --> 03:25.537
Oh. I love those.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.873
Let's sit somewhere else.

03:32.145 --> 03:33.946
What just happened?

03:33.948 --> 03:38.483
A stranger just lured Sheldon
away with a candy bar.

03:40.386 --> 03:43.121
Wait, isn't she the grad student
that used to follow him around?

03:43.123 --> 03:44.823
Oh, yeah.

03:44.825 --> 03:48.961
Back before he hit puberty
and grew man parts.

03:48.963 --> 03:51.196
So what do you guys
think that's about?

03:51.198 --> 03:52.764
Knowing Sheldon, nothing.

03:52.766 --> 03:55.901
So, tell me about your
scalar dark energy experiment.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.436
Not 'til you tell me
about your latest paper

03:57.438 --> 03:58.804
on quantum loop theory.

03:58.806 --> 04:02.274
Oh. You must be one of those
dessert before dinner people.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.443
(Laughs)

04:04.445 --> 04:08.680
He just made her laugh,
something's wrong.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.983
Do you see the way
she's looking at him?

04:10.985 --> 04:14.386
Yeah. Like Bernadette
used to look at me.

04:14.388 --> 04:17.189
I keep telling you,
close the bathroom door.

04:19.425 --> 04:20.791
Ah, did you see that?

04:20.793 --> 04:23.095
She just touched his hand
and he didn't SWAT it away.

04:23.097 --> 04:25.030
What is happening?

04:25.032 --> 04:29.134
Okay, the simplest explanation
is usually the right one.

04:29.136 --> 04:30.602
Which is?

04:30.604 --> 04:33.772
That ain't Sheldon.

04:36.209 --> 04:37.609
Not only did
they eat together,

04:37.611 --> 04:39.411
Leonard said he
made her laugh.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.646
That's nothing,

04:40.648 --> 04:43.148
Howie said
she touched his hand.

04:43.150 --> 04:44.349
Did he purell?

04:44.351 --> 04:47.019
No.

04:47.021 --> 04:48.587
I cannot believe Leonard

04:48.589 --> 04:52.124
mentioned the toblerone
but left that part out.

04:52.126 --> 04:53.959
Should we call Amy?

04:53.961 --> 04:56.728
I don't know; We shouldn't worry
her if it's nothing.

04:56.730 --> 04:59.097
I guess we could wait till
we have more information

04:59.099 --> 05:00.499
about this girl.
Yeah.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.734
(Sighs)
Do you think living with Amy

05:02.736 --> 05:05.337
has somehow stirred up
Sheldon's...

05:05.339 --> 05:07.939
Sexual appetite?

05:07.941 --> 05:11.009
Ugh.

05:12.779 --> 05:16.014
How can you think that?

05:17.650 --> 05:20.686
Why would you even
put those words together?

05:20.688 --> 05:21.853
All right,
then we agree.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.355
He's not making
any moves,

05:23.357 --> 05:24.923
it's this
Dr. Ramona chick.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.926
Nowitzki. I googled her,
she's pretty cute.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.628
Really? All i
got from Leonard

05:29.630 --> 05:33.865
was the toblerone bar had nuts.

05:35.134 --> 05:36.401
(Gasps)
And get this,

05:36.403 --> 05:38.670
I saw an articulating ladder

05:38.672 --> 05:41.440
with dual-leg leveling,
which delivers stability

05:41.442 --> 05:44.076
and adaptability
to uneven terrain.

05:44.078 --> 05:47.579
Sounds like a big night.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.614
Yeah. Raj made the funniest
joke, he said,

05:49.616 --> 05:52.984
"which is the best ladder to use
to hang myself?"

05:52.986 --> 05:56.121
(Laughs)

05:56.123 --> 05:59.157
So you're keeping busy?
You're not lonely?

05:59.159 --> 05:59.157
Oh, not at all.

05:59.159 --> 06:02.761
I've had outings with Leonard
and raj in the evening,

06:02.763 --> 06:05.697
and-- oh, I had lunch
with Dr. nowitzki.

06:05.699 --> 06:06.765
Who's he?

06:06.767 --> 06:08.500
Oh, Dr. nowitzki is a woman.

06:08.502 --> 06:09.634
Oh. Really?

06:09.636 --> 06:11.069
Uh, when did you meet her?

06:11.071 --> 06:11.937
Many years ago.

06:11.939 --> 06:13.739
Back when she was
a grad student.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.607
She's always been
a huge fan of my work,

06:15.609 --> 06:17.909
and now she's doing
research at Caltech.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.813
Huge fan, you say?

06:21.815 --> 06:23.915
Yes. I think you'd like her.

06:23.917 --> 06:26.852
She's extremely intelligent,
just like you.

06:26.854 --> 06:29.121
Unlike you,
she's tall, blonde

06:29.123 --> 06:32.190
and used to be
an olympic swimmer.

06:33.993 --> 06:36.661
That's terrific.
I'll call you right back.

06:37.630 --> 06:39.197
(skype rings)

06:39.199 --> 06:40.565
Oh, hey, Amy.

06:40.567 --> 06:43.668
I gave you one job!

06:44.637 --> 06:45.771
Keep an eye on him.

06:45.773 --> 06:47.706
How hard is that?

06:47.708 --> 06:49.441
We thought you meant

06:49.443 --> 06:52.110
not letting him
run out into traffic.

06:53.579 --> 06:55.580
Which he only did once.

06:55.582 --> 06:56.848
Yeah.

06:56.850 --> 06:59.351
Why didn't you tell me?

06:59.353 --> 07:01.119
We didn't want you to worry.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.621
Should I worry?

07:02.623 --> 07:04.122
No. Come on,
it's Sheldon.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.557
Nothing is gonna happen.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.426
That's what you said to me
when I started dating him.

07:07.428 --> 07:08.760
And then five years later,

07:08.762 --> 07:11.430
bingo-bango, something happened.

07:11.432 --> 07:14.132
Yeah, but you're gonna
be back in three months.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.400
(Sighs)
You don't get it.

07:15.402 --> 07:18.036
I've been smacking that
ketchup bottle for a long time.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.771
All she's got to do
is tip it over

07:19.773 --> 07:22.674
and point it at her fries.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.743
Well, what do you
want us to do?

07:24.745 --> 07:26.011
I don't know.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.646
Might be the New Jersey talking,

07:27.648 --> 07:31.483
but this nowitzki broad
needs to disappear.

07:31.485 --> 07:33.585
That's ridiculous.

07:33.587 --> 07:34.986
As far as we know,

07:34.988 --> 07:37.823
all that happened is two
scientists had lunch.

07:37.825 --> 07:39.558
Yeah, but one of
those scientists

07:39.560 --> 07:41.760
is a tall,
blonde olympic swimmer.

07:41.762 --> 07:45.163
Come on. Looks don't matter
to Sheldon.

07:45.165 --> 07:48.900
Because he only
has eyes for you.

07:49.769 --> 07:51.269
Nice try.

07:51.271 --> 07:53.405
Thanks.
I was scrambling.

07:56.275 --> 07:57.642
It's unbelievable.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.644
Sheldon has lunch
with another woman

07:59.646 --> 08:02.247
and somehow my wife
yells at me.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.748
Penny laid into me, too.

08:03.750 --> 08:08.687
Apparently, I'm overly fixated
on premium Swiss chocolate bars.

08:08.689 --> 08:11.623
Can you even eat those things?

08:11.625 --> 08:13.425
If I take a lactaid
a half-hour before

08:13.427 --> 08:15.494
and some pepto right after.

08:15.496 --> 08:16.962
Sounds like a lot of work.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.297
Yeah. Eh, I'm worth it.

08:20.566 --> 08:21.933
Guys. Focus.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.702
Should we do something
about nowitzki?

08:23.704 --> 08:25.871
Like what?

08:25.873 --> 08:27.372
Uh, well, she's single,

08:27.374 --> 08:30.075
so if somebody else asks her out
and she says yes,

08:30.077 --> 08:32.443
then we know
she's not into Sheldon.

08:32.446 --> 08:34.044
I'll do it.

08:37.817 --> 08:40.284
No offense, Stuart,

08:40.287 --> 08:42.554
but th-th-the
woman's a doctor.

08:42.556 --> 08:44.856
So? Doctors like me.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.892
Whenever I see mine he calls in

08:46.894 --> 08:50.028
a bunch of other
doctors to have a look.

08:51.864 --> 08:54.299
She's not that
kind of doctor.

08:54.301 --> 08:55.500
Stuart:
Oh.

08:55.502 --> 08:56.868
Well, her loss.

08:56.870 --> 09:01.039
I've been called
a genuine medical oddity.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.013
Actually, I was
going to suggest me.

09:08.015 --> 09:11.082
Great. Anybody's
better than, mmm.

09:12.518 --> 09:13.785
Excuse me.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.754
They took out my spleen
and gallbladder,

09:15.756 --> 09:17.989
not my feelings.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.397
(Clears throat)

09:25.399 --> 09:26.731
Dr. nowitzki.

09:26.733 --> 09:29.167
Good to see you.
Good to see you, too.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.468
May I join you?

09:30.470 --> 09:31.903
No.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.508
Good to see you.

09:39.378 --> 09:42.113
We should call guinness,
that might be a record.

09:43.349 --> 09:45.550
She's clearly having
a working lunch

09:45.552 --> 09:47.852
and preferred to eat alone.

09:47.854 --> 09:50.255
Dr. Cooper, over here.

09:51.891 --> 09:55.327
I could have made her
very happy.

09:55.329 --> 09:58.129
You kept walking.
I think you did.

10:00.967 --> 10:03.068
Do you really think
there's reason to worry?

10:03.070 --> 10:05.337
Yeah, she's definitely
going after Sheldon.

10:05.339 --> 10:07.339
I made a play for her
and she shot me down.

10:07.341 --> 10:09.407
All right, well,
that doesn't prove anything.

10:09.409 --> 10:13.244
Yeah, there's a million reasons
a woman would shoot raj down.

10:14.814 --> 10:16.815
Like, really, a million?

10:16.817 --> 10:18.116
Fine, hundreds.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.217
Thank you.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.186
The point is
this could be nothing

10:21.188 --> 10:23.822
and we are all overreacting.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.490
Hey, everybody.

10:25.492 --> 10:26.858
This is my friend,

10:26.860 --> 10:28.426
Dr. nowitzki.
Hi.

10:28.428 --> 10:31.496
All:
Hi.

10:31.498 --> 10:34.532
We just went swimming.

10:39.705 --> 10:41.640
And you actually
got in a pool?

10:41.642 --> 10:43.108
I was scared,

10:43.110 --> 10:48.046
but I told myself it's
just a big bathtub.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.280
Then I got scared again
'cause there are

10:49.282 --> 10:52.150
all these strangers
in my bathtub.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.652
I was proud of him--
a lot of people

10:53.654 --> 10:55.654
don't put their face in
the water on the first day.

10:55.656 --> 10:59.324
Well, I was hiding from a
bee, but it still counts.

11:01.093 --> 11:04.229
Can I just squeeze in here?

11:06.866 --> 11:09.267
So, Sheldon, have
you talked to Amy?

11:09.269 --> 11:10.735
Yes, we skyped this morning

11:10.737 --> 11:12.671
and I'm sure I'll check in
with her before I go to sleep.

11:12.673 --> 11:13.905
Ramona:
Sheldon talks about her

11:13.907 --> 11:15.740
all the time.
I can't wait to meet her.

11:15.742 --> 11:15.740
That is true.

11:15.742 --> 11:20.412
She keeps asking how long
Amy's going to be gone.

11:22.048 --> 11:24.182
Uh, so, Ramona,
tell us about yourself.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.950
Do you, do you
have a boyfriend?

11:25.952 --> 11:28.553
Leonard, your wife
is sitting right here.

11:28.555 --> 11:30.321
What are you doing?

11:32.591 --> 11:35.360
No, my work doesn't leave me a
lot of time for relationships.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.562
I think you made that
very clear.

11:37.564 --> 11:41.166
She was part of the
American team at cern.

11:41.168 --> 11:44.436
I had a front row seat when
they detected the higgs boson.

11:44.438 --> 11:45.904
Sheldon:
Do you know,

11:45.906 --> 11:47.572
I've corresponded
with Peter higgs.

11:47.574 --> 11:49.274
Would you like to see
some of his letters?

11:49.276 --> 11:51.142
Absolutely.
I'll get them.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.511
Well, hang on,
I'll come with you.

11:53.513 --> 11:54.779
Oh, fun.

11:54.781 --> 11:56.981
Like a play date.

11:57.516 --> 11:59.317
(Door closes)

11:59.319 --> 12:01.086
Okay, correct me if I'm wrong,
but isn't that exactly

12:01.088 --> 12:03.722
what we were supposed to stop
from happening?

12:03.724 --> 12:05.824
I threw my body at them,

12:05.826 --> 12:08.393
what else did you want me to do?

12:09.195 --> 12:11.596
You think you should call Amy?

12:11.598 --> 12:13.998
You got fingers and a mouth,
you call her.

12:16.936 --> 12:18.536
Here you go.

12:18.538 --> 12:20.572
Are these all
from Peter higgs?

12:20.574 --> 12:21.840
Hmm? Oh, no, no, no.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.141
They're from many
famous people.

12:23.143 --> 12:24.676
See? Oh, like this one.

12:24.678 --> 12:26.077
This is from
Patrick Stewart.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.646
It says if I come
to his house again,

12:28.648 --> 12:31.015
I get to meet his dogs.

12:33.619 --> 12:34.652
(skype rings)

12:34.654 --> 12:36.554
Oh, excuse me.

12:38.124 --> 12:41.259
Hello, Sheldon.
Oh, hello, Amy.

12:42.495 --> 12:43.695
I was missing you again.

12:43.697 --> 12:45.230
I miss you, too.

12:45.232 --> 12:46.664
Hey, this is good timing.

12:46.666 --> 12:49.634
Remember that Dr. nowitzki
i told you about?

12:49.636 --> 12:50.969
She's right here.

12:50.971 --> 12:54.172
Sh-she's what?

12:55.307 --> 12:57.208
Hello.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.611
Hi.

12:59.613 --> 13:01.212
So nice to meet you.

13:01.214 --> 13:02.981
Uh-huh.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.250
(Phone rings)

13:05.252 --> 13:07.585
Hang on.

13:07.587 --> 13:09.654
Hello.

13:09.656 --> 13:12.524
A little late, Leonard.

13:12.526 --> 13:14.392
I'm sorry.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.761
What is Leonard doing
calling you at this hour?

13:16.763 --> 13:18.696
It's not important.

13:18.698 --> 13:21.933
I must tell you, that seems
a little inappropriate.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.501
Don't you agree?

13:23.503 --> 13:24.669
I do.

13:24.671 --> 13:26.471
See?

13:26.473 --> 13:28.473
We both think so.

13:30.943 --> 13:32.310
All right, this
is making me crazy.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.578
Somebody's got
to go over there.

13:33.580 --> 13:36.381
You got feet and legs,
you do it.

13:39.118 --> 13:40.218
Will you with me?

13:40.220 --> 13:43.354
To do what?
Shake a can of nickels at them?

13:44.356 --> 13:47.192
We're being ridiculous.

13:47.194 --> 13:48.560
There's no way a woman
that attractive

13:48.562 --> 13:52.363
is trying to seduce
Sheldon Cooper.

13:52.365 --> 13:55.433
You done trying to make
yourself feel better?

13:55.435 --> 13:58.770
No. I haven't played
the race card yet.

14:00.439 --> 14:03.441
Hey, I hate to
break up the party,

14:03.443 --> 14:07.212
but Amy says I'm tired
and have to go to bed.

14:08.314 --> 14:10.148
It was nice
seeing everybody.

14:10.150 --> 14:11.349
Thank you for dinner.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.784
Sure.
Our pleasure.

14:12.786 --> 14:15.053
Whatever.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.788
Walk me to my car?

14:16.790 --> 14:17.922
Of course.

14:17.924 --> 14:20.758
We'll all go.

14:22.000 --> 14:28.074

14:36.141 --> 14:37.675
Excuse me.

14:49.088 --> 14:51.289
Pardon. I just need to... yeah.

15:01.700 --> 15:02.967
(Laughing):
That was fun.

15:02.969 --> 15:05.169
It was like Mario kart.

15:08.340 --> 15:10.708
Bye.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.243
We need to talk.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.012
Wh-- is this about
Leonard and Amy?

15:14.014 --> 15:15.713
I don't like it either.

15:19.118 --> 15:21.853
Okay, I know you don't have a
lot of experience with women,

15:21.855 --> 15:23.254
but Ramona seems to have

15:23.256 --> 15:25.256
a romantic interest in you.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.125
That doesn't make any sense.

15:27.127 --> 15:28.760
She knows I have a girlfriend.

15:28.762 --> 15:30.762
Well, sometimes women
don't care.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.997
Sometimes it makes them
want a guy even more.

15:32.999 --> 15:35.400
That may be true,

15:35.402 --> 15:37.669
but Dr. nowitzki's
just a friend.

15:37.671 --> 15:40.038
In fact, I wouldn't have
even noticed she's a woman

15:40.040 --> 15:43.741
if she hadn't worn that bathing
suit that highlighted her bosom.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.947
Okay. Um... (Clears throat)
...Let's try this.

15:48.949 --> 15:50.748
Think of yourself
as one of those

15:50.750 --> 15:53.584
limited edition toys
people like to collect.

15:53.586 --> 15:56.487
I already do.

15:57.690 --> 15:59.490
Well, then you get it.

15:59.492 --> 16:02.026
(Gasps)
Because there's
only one of me,

16:02.028 --> 16:03.628
I'm more valuable.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.029
Right.

16:05.031 --> 16:07.165
Although, Amy's
already taken me

16:07.167 --> 16:10.268
out of my package
and played with me.

16:13.572 --> 16:15.606
Let's forget the toy thing,
okay?

16:15.608 --> 16:18.443
Um, maybe...
Penny, look. I
appreciate your concern,

16:18.445 --> 16:21.045
but I don't think
that's what's happening.

16:21.047 --> 16:23.715
All right. What do
you think is happening?

16:23.717 --> 16:26.784
I think Dr. nowitzki is
a friendly colleague.

16:26.786 --> 16:30.788
I think you and Leonard need
to see a marriage counselor.

16:32.257 --> 16:34.192
And I need to
update my résumé

16:34.194 --> 16:36.361
to include swimming
as a special skill.

16:44.236 --> 16:47.238
Don't look at me
like that, I tried.

16:51.744 --> 16:53.077
(Knocking at door)

16:53.079 --> 16:55.213
Hey, did you eat yet?

16:55.215 --> 16:57.148
Uh, breakfast yes, lunch no.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.750
I did have a cough drop,

16:58.752 --> 17:03.321
but that really rides the
line between sucking and eating.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.089
Well, perfect.
I made us sandwiches.

17:05.090 --> 17:06.958
How thoughtful.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.059
Thank you.

17:08.060 --> 17:09.160
Mmm. No big deal,

17:09.162 --> 17:11.029
I enjoy spending time with you.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.829
And I with you.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.898
Question:

17:14.901 --> 17:18.703
Are you seeking a romantic
relationship with me?

17:19.704 --> 17:21.339
What if I were?

17:21.340 --> 17:24.776
Well, that would raise
a number of problems.

17:24.778 --> 17:25.777
We're colleagues.

17:25.779 --> 17:27.444
I'm currently
in a relation...

17:35.320 --> 17:37.855
Excuse me a moment.

18:02.448 --> 18:04.649
(Seat belt bell chimes)

18:11.924 --> 18:13.925
(Laughs)

18:37.516 --> 18:38.316
Amy.

18:38.318 --> 18:39.350
Amy.
(Knocks again)

18:39.352 --> 18:41.052
(Knocks again)
Amy.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.770
Will you marry me?
