01:20.457 --> 01:23.460
Mr. Black: It was
July 18th, 1969.

01:25.462 --> 01:28.465
It was early in the
morning, about 5:30 a.m.

01:29.550 --> 01:31.218
It was a beautiful
day to fly.

01:31.343 --> 01:32.970
No wind to speak of.

01:33.095 --> 01:34.638
So how could
it be better?

01:36.515 --> 01:38.517
We start up the engines.

01:38.642 --> 01:40.435
We were full of fuel.

01:40.561 --> 01:41.228
Everything was fine.

01:41.353 --> 01:43.397
And we started taxiing.

01:47.234 --> 01:48.318
And then sure enough,

01:48.443 --> 01:50.070
the aircraft
started to climb.

01:50.195 --> 01:53.156
Chuck brought the landing
gear up.

01:54.241 --> 01:55.909
We were accelerating
and climbing

01:56.034 --> 01:56.910
above the runway,

01:57.035 --> 01:59.204
and I think we were about

01:59.329 --> 02:02.499
100 feet above the ground
when I started noticing

02:02.624 --> 02:03.667
that something was wrong.

02:05.711 --> 02:07.671
You have one engine
at higher rpm,

02:07.796 --> 02:09.047
another low rpm.

02:09.172 --> 02:12.092
Now that can happen
with an engine failure.

02:14.094 --> 02:16.179
And I mean,
I grabbed the chairs

02:16.305 --> 02:18.932
and held on
and looked out

02:19.057 --> 02:21.476
and I saw a bunch
of green grass

02:21.602 --> 02:23.437
and it looked
like a city park

02:23.562 --> 02:25.647
And I thought, well,
worst case scenario,

02:25.772 --> 02:28.150
we've always been trained
to just land in a park.

02:29.234 --> 02:32.237
But the next thing
I noticed was

02:32.404 --> 02:35.365
towering trees
were filling our windshield

02:37.034 --> 02:38.577
Chuck grabbed
the flight controls,

02:38.702 --> 02:41.622
and he yanks them all
the way left.

02:41.747 --> 02:42.956
As far as they'll go.

02:43.081 --> 02:45.042
And then he pulls them
all the way back,

02:45.167 --> 02:46.835
against his chest.

02:58.972 --> 03:01.975
I suddenly found myself

03:02.100 --> 03:05.103
above the crash site,

03:06.480 --> 03:07.940
but unaware

03:08.065 --> 03:11.068
of what I was
looking at or why.

03:11.443 --> 03:12.819
I was not in any pain.

03:12.945 --> 03:15.155
I was not in any fear
or discomfort.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.824
I was just above this
crash site.

03:23.038 --> 03:26.333
I could see an airplane
and I could see a pilot.

03:26.458 --> 03:28.961
First of all, my eyes
went right to one pilot.

03:29.086 --> 03:31.171
This was Gene.

03:31.296 --> 03:33.799
And then I went over
and I saw another pilot

03:33.924 --> 03:35.676
right next to him
five feet away.

03:35.801 --> 03:38.762
And I recognized this
as Chuck.

03:41.390 --> 03:43.892
And while I'm processing
what I'm looking at,

03:44.017 --> 03:47.104
I see a third pilot also
about five feet away.

03:48.480 --> 03:51.483
And this is me.

04:05.998 --> 04:09.334
Mr. Burke: Imagine if what
we're living here on this

04:09.459 --> 04:12.546
earth is really being
lived on a flat, black

04:12.671 --> 04:14.548
and white
painting on a wall,

04:14.673 --> 04:15.924
and death is separation.

04:16.049 --> 04:17.551
So when we die, our

04:17.676 --> 04:20.637
spirit separates
from our physical body.

04:22.222 --> 04:23.557
You die and
you're ripped off

04:23.682 --> 04:25.308
that flat,
black and white

04:25.434 --> 04:26.768
two-dimensional painting

04:26.893 --> 04:29.563
your brought out into a
three-dimensional room

04:29.688 --> 04:31.732
of color all around you.

04:33.608 --> 04:34.484
You're experiencing things

04:34.609 --> 04:35.652
you've never
experienced before,

04:35.777 --> 04:37.195
even though you can
see your world

04:37.320 --> 04:39.406
is contained
within this world,

04:40.991 --> 04:43.076
then imagine
you're put back into

04:43.201 --> 04:44.911
that flat,
black and white painting,

04:45.037 --> 04:46.538
and you have to describe

04:46.663 --> 04:49.374
three dimensions of color

04:49.499 --> 04:52.502
in two-dimensional
black and white terms.

04:52.627 --> 04:53.670
How would you do it?

05:32.667 --> 05:34.002
Dr. Sabom: Medically,

05:34.127 --> 05:35.337
Scientifically,

05:35.587 --> 05:37.172
the point of death

05:37.923 --> 05:39.299
cannot be defined.

05:39.424 --> 05:44.554
What we do know is there
is a process of dying

05:45.555 --> 05:47.015
during which I feel the

05:47.140 --> 05:50.060
near-death
experience occurs.

05:53.522 --> 05:56.149
75% of the people in that
first study

05:56.274 --> 05:59.277
have had a documented
cardiac arrest.

06:03.073 --> 06:04.407
Part of the
experience is they

06:04.533 --> 06:06.159
said they floated up
out of their body

06:06.284 --> 06:07.994
and they can see
what was going on

06:08.120 --> 06:10.080
during the resuscitation.

06:10.539 --> 06:13.542
I felt that myself,
as a cardiologist

06:13.667 --> 06:16.670
could pick that apart.

07:29.159 --> 07:31.203
Mr. Burke: This is clinical
death as we know it,

07:31.328 --> 07:33.288
sometimes
for a few minutes,

07:33.413 --> 07:35.916
sometimes 30 minutes,
sometimes hours.

07:36.041 --> 07:39.044
And yet modern medicine
or the miraculous,

07:39.211 --> 07:40.045
I don't know,

07:40.170 --> 07:41.671
resuscitated them

07:41.796 --> 07:43.340
and they were able
to come back

07:43.465 --> 07:44.841
and talk about it.

07:44.966 --> 07:46.760
You may think
you've died.

07:46.885 --> 07:48.595
Dr. Sabom: All definitions,
medically,

07:48.720 --> 07:50.555
scientifically,
and legally

07:50.722 --> 07:53.433
state that once you go
across that red line,

07:53.558 --> 07:55.101
i.e. you die,

07:55.977 --> 07:57.520
you don't come back.

07:57.729 --> 08:00.732
And I like to say doctors
resuscitate,

08:01.149 --> 08:03.276
not resurrect
their patients.

08:04.569 --> 08:06.196
Mr. Burke: I was actually
an agnostic.

08:06.321 --> 08:08.281
I didn't know if I
believed there was a God.

08:08.406 --> 08:10.116
I thought, I don't
know if I believe

08:10.242 --> 08:11.243
there's a heaven or not,

08:11.368 --> 08:13.453
but my dad was
dying of cancer

08:13.578 --> 08:16.915
and someone gave him
the very first research

08:17.040 --> 08:20.043
on what's now called
near-death experiences.

08:20.293 --> 08:21.753
And I saw it
on his nightstand,

08:21.878 --> 08:24.339
picked it up
and read it in one night.

08:24.464 --> 08:26.174
And that just
got me curious.

08:26.299 --> 08:29.261
So I kind of opened my
my eyes, my mind,

08:29.719 --> 08:31.263
and I started
to explore from there.

08:34.099 --> 08:35.517
I found it fascinating,

08:35.642 --> 08:37.811
kind of, the train
of how this

08:37.936 --> 08:39.854
whole near-death
experience phenomenon

08:39.980 --> 08:42.941
started to get
traction in America.

08:43.275 --> 08:47.112
Dr. George Ritchie
was the first one

08:47.237 --> 08:49.948
to really talk
publicly about this.

08:50.073 --> 08:52.409
He was actually
at Camp Barkeley

08:52.534 --> 08:55.537
getting ready to go
fight in World War II.

08:55.704 --> 08:58.415
Joan Rivers: What happened
during those 9 minutes?

08:58.540 --> 08:59.791
What did you see?
What happened?

08:59.916 --> 09:01.293
Dr. Ritchie: I met
the Christ

09:01.418 --> 09:03.169
because I was told
to stand up, you are

09:03.295 --> 09:04.921
in the presence
of the Son of God.

09:05.046 --> 09:07.132
He came into my room

09:07.257 --> 09:09.676
and he conducted me
through four different

09:09.801 --> 09:11.636
realms of life
after death.

09:11.761 --> 09:13.805
Life really is
forever. We don't die.

09:13.930 --> 09:16.057
Death is nothing
more than just a gateway

09:16.182 --> 09:16.933
through which we go.

09:17.058 --> 09:20.520
Mr. Burke: Dr. Moody
actually heard him lecture

09:20.645 --> 09:22.230
at the University
of Virginia,

09:22.355 --> 09:24.649
where he was
a visiting professor

09:24.774 --> 09:25.942
and heard him talk about

09:26.067 --> 09:27.110
this near-death
experience.

09:27.235 --> 09:28.611
Dr. Moody: In 1969,

09:28.737 --> 09:30.447
I became a professor
of philosophy

09:30.572 --> 09:32.365
at East
Carolina University

09:32.490 --> 09:34.659
and in teaching
courses on Plato.

09:34.784 --> 09:36.202
I began to hear these

09:36.328 --> 09:38.580
experiences
from my students

09:38.705 --> 09:41.291
and also from other
faculty members.

09:41.416 --> 09:42.500
Dr. Sabom: I was
brought into this

09:42.625 --> 09:44.294
field kicking
and screaming.

09:44.419 --> 09:46.796
I was at the University
of Florida in Gainesville

09:46.921 --> 09:48.548
with Sarah Kreissinger

09:48.673 --> 09:50.467
who was a psychiatric,
social worker

09:50.592 --> 09:52.761
at the hospital
I was working at.

09:52.886 --> 09:54.262
And she had picked up

09:54.387 --> 09:56.806
Raymond Moody's book
Life After Life,

09:56.931 --> 09:58.224
about two months

09:58.350 --> 10:00.643
after it was
initially published.

10:00.769 --> 10:02.854
She read it.
She gave it to me.

10:02.979 --> 10:04.606
She asked me
what I thought.

10:04.731 --> 10:06.024
This is Dr. Raymond
Moody,

10:06.149 --> 10:08.777
noted psychiatrist,
lecturer, and researcher.

10:08.902 --> 10:10.612
He is perhaps best
known as the author

10:10.737 --> 10:12.155
of the groundbreaking
examination

10:12.280 --> 10:13.615
of the near-death
experience.

10:13.740 --> 10:16.451
The bestselling book,
Life After Life.

10:16.576 --> 10:19.037
It has sold upwards
of 15 million copies,

10:19.162 --> 10:22.040
and has been printed in
14 different languages.

10:22.165 --> 10:23.416
Dr. Moody: They tell us,
first of all,

10:23.541 --> 10:25.210
that they seem,
from their point of view,

10:25.335 --> 10:27.379
to leave
their physical bodies

10:27.504 --> 10:30.590
to float up above the
scene of the resuscitation

10:30.715 --> 10:33.510
and to watch the events
going on down below.

10:35.887 --> 10:37.347
They tell us that they go

10:37.472 --> 10:40.392
through a narrow
passageway or a tunnel

10:41.267 --> 10:43.019
into an
incredibly brilliant

10:43.144 --> 10:44.729
and warm and loving light

10:45.772 --> 10:46.856
Dr. Sabom: Hogwash.

10:46.981 --> 10:49.526
I never heard
these experiences before.

10:49.651 --> 10:50.819
I went into the hospital

10:50.944 --> 10:52.821
asking some of the
older physicians,

10:52.946 --> 10:54.989
"Hey, you ever heard
a patient say this?"

10:55.115 --> 10:55.949
"No."

10:58.493 --> 11:00.537
So I was very skeptical

11:00.662 --> 11:02.872
that these things
were even occurring.

11:02.997 --> 11:04.541
And if they were
occurring,

11:04.666 --> 11:06.376
they were either
hallucinations

11:06.501 --> 11:09.421
or delusions or whatever.

11:11.714 --> 11:15.176
In cardiology, we're about
scientific studies.

11:15.427 --> 11:16.928
So I asked a few people

11:17.053 --> 11:18.596
who had been resuscitated,

11:18.721 --> 11:19.556
and the third patient

11:19.681 --> 11:21.641
I talked to had
an experience

11:21.766 --> 11:23.101
similar to what
Moody talked

11:23.226 --> 11:25.437
about in his book,
Life After Life.

11:25.562 --> 11:28.022
So, Sarah and I said,

11:28.148 --> 11:31.443
Well, maybe we ought
to look into this further.

11:32.777 --> 11:35.572
We devised a
scientific protocol

11:35.697 --> 11:36.948
to interview
these people.

11:37.073 --> 11:38.992
We tape recorded
the interviews.

11:39.117 --> 11:40.827
We took down
their background data,

11:40.952 --> 11:43.538
the demographics,
etc.. And...

11:44.789 --> 11:47.041
this went
on for five years.

11:47.167 --> 11:48.710
First of all,
I'd get permission

11:48.835 --> 11:52.464
to tape record it
and then say,

11:52.589 --> 11:53.798
okay, go...

12:58.279 --> 12:59.447
Dr. Sabom: These
people say,

12:59.572 --> 13:01.533
"I've never told anybody
about this, doc.

13:01.658 --> 13:02.909
And by the way, I'm
the only one

13:03.034 --> 13:04.410
that's ever had this."

13:04.536 --> 13:07.163
So the near-death
experience at that time,

13:07.288 --> 13:11.417
and that's about 45 years
ago was not well known.

13:11.626 --> 13:14.462
And so these people
were sort of

13:14.587 --> 13:16.381
coming up
with it on their own,

13:16.506 --> 13:19.634
and they were suspicious
of me asking the questions,

13:19.968 --> 13:20.802
which to me

13:20.927 --> 13:23.763
lent credibility to what
they were telling me.

13:23.888 --> 13:25.557
Dr. Moody: Many of them
said, for example,

13:25.682 --> 13:28.434
that they had tried to tell
their doctor about it

13:28.560 --> 13:31.437
or a minister about it and
that they were dismissed.

13:31.563 --> 13:33.648
And in those initial years,

13:33.773 --> 13:37.068
the people that I talked
with were just very happy

13:37.193 --> 13:39.320
that at last somebody
would listen to them.

13:42.282 --> 13:44.576
Mr. Storm: I started at
Northern Kentucky University

13:44.701 --> 13:46.369
in 1972.

13:46.828 --> 13:49.205
I was hired as an assistant
professor and I was

13:50.164 --> 13:52.542
offered a promotion
to full professor

13:52.667 --> 13:55.795
at the age of 25, and
I was also given tenure

13:56.921 --> 13:59.340
my third year.

14:01.593 --> 14:03.177
Seven students, myself

14:03.303 --> 14:03.970
and my wife

14:04.095 --> 14:05.722
toured Amsterdam

14:05.847 --> 14:08.016
and then went up
to Denmark.

14:08.141 --> 14:11.102
Spent a few days there,
went to Sweden for a day.

14:11.519 --> 14:14.230
And last week, it was
a three week trip,

14:14.355 --> 14:17.275
and our last week,
was a week in Paris.

14:19.110 --> 14:23.656
It was an art tour, it was,
pretty much all museums.

14:26.367 --> 14:28.286
On that Saturday morning,

14:28.411 --> 14:29.954
June 1, 1985,

14:30.079 --> 14:31.164
and I had the most acute

14:31.289 --> 14:32.915
pain I'd ever
experienced in my life

14:33.041 --> 14:36.044
in the center of
my abdomen. Right there.

14:41.090 --> 14:42.467
It was terrifying
because it

14:42.592 --> 14:43.843
it just came from
nowhere.

14:43.968 --> 14:46.179
And I never experienced
such acute pain.

14:46.304 --> 14:47.764
I mean, this was like

14:47.889 --> 14:49.390
the kind of pain
that blows

14:49.515 --> 14:50.725
the top of your head off.

14:55.355 --> 14:56.731
A doctor
came very quickly,

14:56.856 --> 14:57.982
got me up
off the floor,

14:58.107 --> 14:59.901
with a great deal of
difficulty because

15:00.026 --> 15:01.235
I couldn't move.

15:01.361 --> 15:02.612
He knew exactly
what was wrong.

15:02.737 --> 15:04.781
and told me that I
had a perforation

15:04.906 --> 15:05.990
of the duodenum.

15:06.115 --> 15:07.450
Which means I had a hole

15:07.575 --> 15:09.452
go through my
small stomach.

15:10.119 --> 15:12.080
What was happening
was the hydrochloric acid

15:12.205 --> 15:12.872
and the enzymes

15:12.997 --> 15:13.748
and the bacteria
in everything

15:13.873 --> 15:15.166
are now migrating, leaking

15:15.291 --> 15:16.709
into my abdominal cavity.

15:16.834 --> 15:17.877
To put it in crude terms.

15:18.002 --> 15:21.422
I was digesting myself,
on the inside.

15:22.590 --> 15:24.092
Without exaggeration,

15:24.217 --> 15:25.718
what it felt like
was fire.

15:26.719 --> 15:28.137
my wife riding alongside me

15:28.262 --> 15:29.055
in the back of
the ambulance

15:29.180 --> 15:31.724
as we traveled
70, 80 miles an hour

15:31.849 --> 15:34.977
through the streets
of Paris to the big

15:35.770 --> 15:36.813
city hospital

15:39.273 --> 15:40.692
they confirmed basically,

15:40.817 --> 15:42.527
if I didn't have the
surgery in an hour,

15:42.652 --> 15:43.653
I would die.

15:45.113 --> 15:47.740
So they sent me
to the surgical hospital.

15:47.865 --> 15:49.242
And because it was
the weekend,

15:49.367 --> 15:51.869
there was no doctor
available.

15:51.994 --> 15:54.622
No surgeon
available at the hospital

15:54.747 --> 15:57.667
they sent me to.
So I was put in a room.

15:59.711 --> 16:00.753
I begged, I screamed,

16:00.878 --> 16:03.840
I yelled,

16:05.133 --> 16:05.967
and my wife begged

16:06.092 --> 16:07.385
and yelled and screamed,

16:07.510 --> 16:09.512
Nurse, can someone
please come in here?

16:11.681 --> 16:12.306
Mr. Storm: Sorry.

16:12.432 --> 16:14.809
We need a doctor
to prescribe something

16:14.934 --> 16:16.978
Can you please talk
to someone who can help us?

16:17.103 --> 16:18.104
There has to be somebody,

16:18.229 --> 16:20.273
how can there not be
someone here?

16:24.902 --> 16:27.780
Mr. Storm: There I
was for 10 hours.

16:27.905 --> 16:29.532
About once an hour,
the nurse would come in

16:29.657 --> 16:32.160
and ask how I was doing,
and I would tell her in

16:32.285 --> 16:35.246
French and English
that I was dying and

16:36.456 --> 16:39.459
shrug their shoulders
and walk away.

16:40.460 --> 16:41.502
I wasn't in fear.

16:41.627 --> 16:42.879
I was in terror

16:43.004 --> 16:45.882
Because I was 38 years old,
very successful

16:46.007 --> 16:47.633
in my career
at the university,

16:47.759 --> 16:52.013
you know, wife and two
kids, nice house, two cars.

16:52.472 --> 16:53.723
The thing
that kept going through

16:53.848 --> 16:55.725
my mind is this
can't be happening.

16:55.850 --> 16:57.977
This can't be happening.
This can't be happening.

17:00.521 --> 17:01.355
People ask me,

17:01.481 --> 17:02.690
How do you know
you were dying?

17:02.815 --> 17:05.735
It's like the stupidest
question in the world

17:06.819 --> 17:08.571
when you're dying,
you know it

17:09.697 --> 17:11.407
with every breath.

17:11.532 --> 17:14.452
I felt like I had one more
breath to go.

17:17.955 --> 17:21.751
Nurse came into the room
at 8:30 that night

17:21.876 --> 17:23.169
and said they were sorry,

17:23.294 --> 17:23.961
but they were

17:24.086 --> 17:26.714
unable to locate a doctor
and they would try

17:26.839 --> 17:29.801
to find one the next day,
which was Sunday.

17:30.551 --> 17:32.428
Well, when she said that,
I was like,

17:32.553 --> 17:34.347
okay, it's over. Done.

17:34.472 --> 17:36.098
You know,
I can't do this anymore.

17:36.224 --> 17:38.267
You know, I'm exhausted.

17:38.392 --> 17:39.352
And I looked
at her [Beverly],

17:39.477 --> 17:42.396
and it was horrible to
see her crying like that.

17:43.397 --> 17:47.068
And I closed my eyes and
stopped trying to breathe.

17:47.193 --> 17:50.196
And I went unconscious.

17:52.532 --> 17:54.242
I was an atheist,
and I knew that

17:54.367 --> 17:56.410
when you die,
it's just over.

17:56.536 --> 18:00.414
It's like the big nothing,
you know, void the end.

18:03.292 --> 18:03.918
Mr. Black: The official

18:04.043 --> 18:07.004
impact speed recorded
by the National

18:07.129 --> 18:10.967
Transportation Safety Board
was 135 miles an hour.

18:12.426 --> 18:15.429
We impacted
right below the cockpit

18:15.847 --> 18:16.931
with that impact speed.

18:17.056 --> 18:20.268
It just exploded
the cockpit into...

18:20.393 --> 18:23.020
We just,
everything was opened up.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.064
We hit that dome and fell,

18:25.189 --> 18:28.109
boom,
right down to the ground.

18:29.694 --> 18:31.779
I'm told by the curator

18:31.904 --> 18:33.739
of the mausoleum,
that the mausoleum

18:33.865 --> 18:35.700
was six stories,
seven stories tall.

18:35.825 --> 18:37.285
And we slammed

18:37.410 --> 18:39.537
right into the top of it.

18:41.080 --> 18:42.373
I can remember today

18:42.498 --> 18:45.418
as well as I could five
years ago, ten years ago.

18:46.127 --> 18:50.172
You realize
that you are not

18:51.424 --> 18:53.175
a body.

18:53.301 --> 18:55.344
I believe it's

18:55.469 --> 18:58.431
what happens to everyone
when they die.

19:00.057 --> 19:01.809
Mr. Storm: I awoke
from unconsciousness

19:01.934 --> 19:03.227
standing there

19:03.352 --> 19:04.604
next to the bed,

19:04.729 --> 19:06.606
feeling better than I ever
felt before in my life.

19:08.941 --> 19:12.069
My vision
was greatly increased.

19:12.194 --> 19:13.696
Instead of seeing 106

19:13.821 --> 19:17.241
degrees, I could see
almost 360 degrees.

19:18.117 --> 19:20.828
My depth of field
was total.

19:20.953 --> 19:23.915
When I looked at something
close, I, everything

19:24.040 --> 19:25.458
far was in focus.

19:25.583 --> 19:27.835
Being an artist and being
a visual person, not much.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.922
The first thing I was like,
Wow, I've never been able

19:31.047 --> 19:31.756
to see like this.

19:31.881 --> 19:33.174
Then I realized I
could hear,

19:33.299 --> 19:35.092
smell, taste, touch, everything.

19:35.217 --> 19:36.260
I could feel

19:36.385 --> 19:39.305
all the little nuances
in the cold linoleum floor.

19:40.431 --> 19:43.351
I could hear the buzzing
of the fluorescent lights

19:43.476 --> 19:46.437
in the ceiling
really loudly.

19:47.313 --> 19:50.483
All of my senses were
greatly, greatly enhanced.

19:51.233 --> 19:53.444
Mr. Black: I'm looking
down and I'm realizing

19:53.569 --> 19:56.489
there's my body,
but I'm up here.

19:56.864 --> 20:00.660
I can't be dead because
I've never felt more alive.

20:02.870 --> 20:05.539
I was not only alive,
I was free.

20:05.665 --> 20:07.500
And I didn't understand
this.

20:07.625 --> 20:09.251
But I realized then, okay,

20:10.836 --> 20:13.839
I am a spirit.

20:14.090 --> 20:17.093
I have a soul.

20:18.177 --> 20:18.970
And I used to live

20:19.095 --> 20:22.056
in that body.

20:23.516 --> 20:26.519
I was pressed up against
the instrument panel

20:27.186 --> 20:30.189
and was motionless.

20:30.356 --> 20:32.858
It was 16 minutes
before the fire department

20:32.984 --> 20:33.818
got there.

20:33.943 --> 20:36.946
The paramedics
got there right after

20:39.573 --> 20:42.576
they put me and Chuck
in the same ambulance.

20:43.119 --> 20:48.541
And I have tremendous
strong memories

20:48.874 --> 20:53.754
that I'm watching my body
and Chuck and I'm chasing

20:53.879 --> 20:56.882
that ambulance as it goes
through the streets.

20:57.049 --> 21:00.302
I have no idea
how to explain

21:00.428 --> 21:02.596
a lot of the things
we're talking about.

21:02.722 --> 21:06.892
But chasing that ambulance
without really any effort.

21:07.143 --> 21:08.019
How did I do that?

21:08.144 --> 21:11.063
I don't know.

21:14.400 --> 21:15.651
I wasn't worried.

21:15.776 --> 21:16.986
I wasn't in pain.

21:17.111 --> 21:19.447
I wasn't concerned really.

21:19.572 --> 21:24.410
I was questioning,
what is this all about

21:26.495 --> 21:28.539
Dr. Long: Now, while no two
near-death experiences

21:28.664 --> 21:29.457
are the same,

21:29.582 --> 21:31.083
they have a very consistent

21:31.208 --> 21:33.419
pattern of elements
or what occurs

21:33.544 --> 21:34.879
during the near-death
experience.

21:35.004 --> 21:37.840
That typically occur in
a very consistent process.

21:40.134 --> 21:41.010
The very first thing that

21:41.135 --> 21:44.055
happens is that close
brush with death.

21:44.180 --> 21:45.181
They're unconscious.

21:45.306 --> 21:47.516
They may be clinically dead
with absent heartbeat,

21:47.641 --> 21:48.726
absent breathing.

21:48.851 --> 21:50.311
At that time when
they shouldn't

21:50.436 --> 21:52.813
have any experience at
all, they do.

21:52.938 --> 21:54.815
Often the first thing
that happens is

21:54.940 --> 21:57.860
what's called
an out-of-body experience.

21:58.069 --> 21:59.528
Mr. Burke: People leave
their bodies.

21:59.653 --> 22:01.238
They're, they're watching

22:01.363 --> 22:03.074
the resuscitation
many times, but they say

22:03.199 --> 22:05.284
they still have
a spiritual body.

22:05.409 --> 22:06.494
Dr. Long: From that
vantage point,

22:06.619 --> 22:08.454
they can see ongoing
earthly events

22:08.579 --> 22:09.955
and often later describe

22:10.081 --> 22:13.042
frantic efforts
at their own resuscitation.

22:16.378 --> 22:18.172
Mr. Burke: They move out
of that place

22:18.297 --> 22:19.590
of their resuscitation,

22:19.715 --> 22:22.635
and they come to a place
of exquisite beauty.

22:22.802 --> 22:25.471
- Dr. Sabom:
- They very commonly
see a light at times.

22:25.596 --> 22:28.557
They interpret
that as a religious figure.

22:28.766 --> 22:32.853
Mr. Burke: And this light was
light that is love and life.

22:33.145 --> 22:34.522
It was palpable

22:34.647 --> 22:35.481
and not hard to look at,

22:35.606 --> 22:37.066
but it came out
of everything,

22:37.191 --> 22:39.443
and yet it made everything
vibrant.

22:39.568 --> 22:41.570
The colors,
they say, are far

22:41.695 --> 22:42.988
beyond our color spectrum.

22:44.365 --> 22:45.157
Dr. Long: Music has been

22:45.282 --> 22:47.159
described so beautiful

22:47.284 --> 22:49.286
that they say they've never
heard anything like it.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.831
Nothing like that
is possible on earth.

22:51.956 --> 22:54.208
Dr. Sabom: Deceased
relatives or friends often

22:54.333 --> 22:56.418
come to meet them there.

22:56.544 --> 22:58.921
Mr. Burke: You know, they say
we still have all our memories

22:59.046 --> 23:01.006
our humor,
we're the same people.

23:01.132 --> 23:03.509
But we meet again
on the other side.

23:03.634 --> 23:06.720
Dr. Sabom: And some of them say,
well, I reached a place where

23:06.887 --> 23:07.596
I felt like

23:07.721 --> 23:10.683
if I went any further,
I wouldn't come back

23:11.433 --> 23:12.101
Dr. Long: At that time,

23:12.226 --> 23:13.769
they may then have
a life review.

23:13.894 --> 23:16.814
They may see part
or all of their prior life.

23:17.982 --> 23:19.441
Dr. Sabom: The whole
experience is

23:19.567 --> 23:22.528
very calm,
it's very peaceful.

23:23.320 --> 23:26.323
Some people don't
want to come back.

23:28.576 --> 23:29.577
Mr. Burke: And then many talk

23:29.702 --> 23:32.913
about a God of light
and love

23:33.414 --> 23:35.916
that they experience
in this presence.

23:36.041 --> 23:38.335
This light is brighter
than the sun,

23:38.460 --> 23:41.255
but again, not just light
like we would see

23:41.380 --> 23:42.173
here on earth.

23:43.090 --> 23:46.635
And they feel an
unconditional love

23:46.760 --> 23:48.596
and peace and acceptance

23:48.721 --> 23:51.682
from this God like they've
never experienced before.

23:53.142 --> 23:55.644
- Dr. Long:
- Ultimately, they either
make the choice to return

23:55.769 --> 23:58.731
to the earthly body or
sent back involuntarily.

23:59.648 --> 24:02.484
Mr. Burke: This God almost
always says to them,

24:02.610 --> 24:04.612
Your time is not up yet.

24:04.737 --> 24:07.364
You still have a purpose
on Earth.

24:07.489 --> 24:08.532
Sometimes he asks them,

24:08.657 --> 24:09.950
Do you want to stay
or do you want to go?

24:10.075 --> 24:12.453
Many times he says,
You got to go back.

24:12.578 --> 24:15.581
None of them want to go
back.

24:20.544 --> 24:22.046
Mr. Burke: Not every
single one of

24:22.171 --> 24:24.423
them experiences
all the commonalities.

24:24.548 --> 24:27.843
Some do, some experience
three, four or five,

24:27.968 --> 24:30.930
some ten, 20,
some, all of them.

24:31.513 --> 24:33.807
But those
commonalities overlap.

24:33.933 --> 24:36.393
But there are uniqueness
to each experience.

24:36.518 --> 24:39.563
Like when they encounter
this god of light and love,

24:39.813 --> 24:42.024
each one of them feels like

24:42.149 --> 24:44.068
they are the only
one God loves.

24:46.987 --> 24:47.738
And yet,

24:47.863 --> 24:50.866
they all feel that way.

25:08.217 --> 25:09.260
Mr. Burke: You know actually,
these near-death

25:09.385 --> 25:12.346
experiences are not new.

25:13.472 --> 25:15.182
Plato wrote in the Republic
about

25:15.307 --> 25:18.227
a soldier who comes to
on his funeral pyre

25:18.644 --> 25:21.647
and had an experience
like this.

25:22.231 --> 25:24.358
Paul in the New Testament,
who wrote much of

25:24.483 --> 25:25.526
the New Testament,

25:25.651 --> 25:27.069
I believe in
Acts chapter 14,

25:27.194 --> 25:29.780
He's stoned to
death in Lystra

25:30.072 --> 25:31.156
and left for dead.

25:31.282 --> 25:34.118
And then he gets back up
and he talks about

25:34.243 --> 25:37.246
how he had an experience
of going to heaven

25:40.874 --> 25:41.959
Dr. Moody: In the ancient world.

25:42.084 --> 25:45.129
Presumably these
experiences were very rare.

25:45.796 --> 25:48.132
By the time
I started investigating it

25:48.257 --> 25:50.509
in the 60s
and 70s,

25:50.634 --> 25:52.845
the advent
of cardiopulmonary

25:52.970 --> 25:55.097
resuscitation
had greatly increased

25:55.222 --> 25:57.808
the number of people
who had been to the brink

25:57.933 --> 25:59.101
of death and recovered.

25:59.226 --> 26:01.020
So there were
a lot of cases.

26:01.145 --> 26:04.148
Dr. Sabom: Some of them say,
well, I reached a place where

26:04.273 --> 26:05.024
I felt like

26:05.149 --> 26:08.068
if I went any further,
I wouldn't come back.

26:08.360 --> 26:11.280
And I get questioned
about this a lot.

26:11.405 --> 26:12.197
And the question

26:12.323 --> 26:15.200
is, well, is that really
a barrier or not?

26:15.326 --> 26:16.660
And my answer is,

26:16.785 --> 26:18.537
well, I've not been able
to interview

26:18.662 --> 26:20.331
any of them
that didn't come back.

26:20.456 --> 26:21.623
So I assume

26:21.749 --> 26:25.210
that if they do go over
that, it very well may be

26:25.419 --> 26:26.670
a point of no return.

26:26.795 --> 26:28.714
I have no evidence
to suggest that,

26:28.839 --> 26:32.426
except I have no evidence
to refute it either.

26:35.846 --> 26:37.473
Raymond Moody heard
about our work,

26:37.598 --> 26:40.476
so he called us up
to his house,

26:40.601 --> 26:43.520
along with two
other researchers.

26:44.063 --> 26:46.690
Dr. Moody: And that's when I met
all of these wonderful people

26:46.815 --> 26:50.069
Bruce Grayson and Mike
Sabom and Kenneth Ring.

26:51.111 --> 26:53.447
Dr. Sabom: We got together,
we compared notes

26:53.572 --> 26:55.032
and we said, you know,
we ought to form

26:55.157 --> 26:58.702
a group and share with one
another what we're doing.

26:59.119 --> 27:00.788
And it eventually
turned out to be

27:00.913 --> 27:03.207
what's now known as IANDS

27:03.332 --> 27:06.293
International Association
and Near-Death Studies.

27:10.047 --> 27:12.716
Mr. Burke: After five years of
doing research, Dr. Sabom

27:12.966 --> 27:15.928
ends up writing
a book convinced that

27:16.220 --> 27:19.848
this really does show that
there is life after death.

27:19.973 --> 27:22.643
But then even more
fascinating, he publishes

27:22.768 --> 27:23.727
in the Journal of the

27:23.852 --> 27:25.396
American Medical
Association

27:25.521 --> 27:27.815
his findings and what
changed his mind.

27:28.440 --> 27:30.275
Dr. Long: I was in my
residency training

27:30.401 --> 27:32.152
and I was going through
a bound journal

27:32.277 --> 27:34.029
looking for a cancer
related article.

27:34.154 --> 27:37.032
And completely by accident,
I found in the title

27:37.157 --> 27:39.952
of an article the
term Near-Death experience.

27:42.371 --> 27:44.123
Dr. Long: Everything I knew as
a doctor said,

27:44.248 --> 27:46.792
This is medically
inexplicable.

27:46.917 --> 27:47.918
In this article

27:48.043 --> 27:49.545
all around
the world, were people

27:49.670 --> 27:51.880
having these experiences
while they were unconscious

27:52.005 --> 27:53.799
or even clinically dead

27:53.924 --> 27:55.843
who can't be mystified
by that question

27:55.968 --> 27:58.929
of what happens
after you die?

28:00.806 --> 28:03.267
Dr. Moody: As I've traveled
around the world to China

28:03.392 --> 28:05.102
and Japan and India

28:05.227 --> 28:08.147
and North and South America
and all over Europe,

28:08.564 --> 28:11.150
people all over the world
use the word light,

28:11.275 --> 28:12.693
but they say that it's not

28:12.818 --> 28:13.777
the light that comes

28:13.902 --> 28:16.196
from a light bulb
or from the sun.

28:16.321 --> 28:18.949
But universally
the description is that the

28:19.074 --> 28:21.618
light of complete
compassion and love.

28:21.743 --> 28:24.621
And people also say
that they learned

28:24.746 --> 28:27.124
from their experience
that what we call

28:27.249 --> 28:30.836
death is a transition
into some other reality.

28:31.170 --> 28:33.088
So they
lose their fear of death.

28:38.469 --> 28:41.972
Don Piper: The day was
January 18th, 1989,

28:42.097 --> 28:45.100
very chilly by
South Texas standards.

28:45.559 --> 28:48.103
I almost stopped
in a little town

28:48.228 --> 28:50.898
before you cross
all the bridges to get some

28:51.023 --> 28:52.816
some coffee. I didn't.

28:52.941 --> 28:55.277
The people who were
on the highway ahead of me,

28:55.402 --> 28:57.529
she wanted some coffee.
They pulled over.

28:57.654 --> 29:00.616
I drove past them
and they came in behind me,

29:00.782 --> 29:03.785
Dick and Anita,
Onarecker.

29:04.453 --> 29:09.500
It was foggy
and a slight rain.

29:09.625 --> 29:11.835
It was wet

29:11.960 --> 29:14.880
and I knew I would have to
cross some bridges.

29:16.381 --> 29:19.009
It was an old bridge

29:19.134 --> 29:22.095
and it is very narrow.

29:22.638 --> 29:25.474
I'm just really focused
on getting back

29:25.599 --> 29:28.560
to Alvin, Texas,
where I lived.

29:28.852 --> 29:30.646
I was headed back that way

29:30.771 --> 29:32.272
and looking forward
to seeing my family,

29:32.397 --> 29:35.734
which I missed for three
days, especially my wife.

29:37.152 --> 29:38.320
What I didn't know

29:38.445 --> 29:41.406
was that steep
embankment was there.

29:42.866 --> 29:44.826
It's like going on a tunnel

29:44.952 --> 29:46.870
because you had this
big metal superstructure

29:46.995 --> 29:49.915
above you,
on both sides of you.

29:50.415 --> 29:52.167
You can see only really

29:52.292 --> 29:55.212
to the end of the bridge
and then

29:55.504 --> 29:57.506
the highway goes up.

29:57.631 --> 30:00.634
So I couldn't see beyond
the end of the bridge.

30:01.051 --> 30:02.970
Out of nowhere, a tractor

30:03.095 --> 30:06.014
trailer truck
hit the car in his lane,

30:06.265 --> 30:09.393
then came over to my lane
and hit me head on.

30:22.990 --> 30:25.450
When we approached
the bridge,

30:25.576 --> 30:27.953
the first thing on
the right

30:28.078 --> 30:31.123
was this large 18 wheeler,
and then the next

30:31.248 --> 30:33.667
thing on the left,
I believe, was a gray car.

30:33.792 --> 30:36.712
It had a single older
man in it.

30:37.796 --> 30:40.966
Then the next thing
was Don's red car

30:41.091 --> 30:43.385
that was all crushed
and smashed.

30:43.510 --> 30:46.054
So we were only
four vehicles on the bridge

30:46.179 --> 30:47.472
at that point.

30:47.598 --> 30:48.473
Swen Spujt: I was stationed

30:48.599 --> 30:50.100
in Walker
County at the time.

30:50.225 --> 30:51.768
I said,
How does it look for him?

30:51.893 --> 30:53.687
And they said,
"not good at all."

30:53.812 --> 30:56.064
That was, you know, just
something I never forgot.

30:56.189 --> 30:57.608
I mean, was seeing that

30:57.733 --> 30:59.901
it was a miserable,
miserable day.

31:00.027 --> 31:01.528
Traffic is backed
up from miles

31:01.653 --> 31:03.655
in both directions
because at that time

31:03.780 --> 31:06.116
there was the only bridge
across that lake,

31:06.241 --> 31:07.284
in fact, Dick Onarecker.

31:07.451 --> 31:08.201
And Anita

31:08.327 --> 31:11.830
had to leave their car
and walk up on the bridge

31:11.955 --> 31:14.791
to get to where
the accident was.

31:14.916 --> 31:16.918
Police approached
Dick first and said,

31:17.044 --> 31:18.962
Don't even bother
with that man.

31:19.087 --> 31:21.590
I've already checked him
and he has no pulse.

31:21.715 --> 31:23.592
And then Dick did check,

31:23.717 --> 31:26.136
and he could not
identify any pulse.

31:27.721 --> 31:30.641
You could see from this
wrecking yard picture that

31:30.766 --> 31:33.727
the trajectory of the truck
as it went over.

31:34.978 --> 31:37.773
When the truck hit me,
it literally took

31:37.898 --> 31:40.859
this arm over my shoulder
into the back seat.

31:41.902 --> 31:42.903
The steering wheel

31:43.028 --> 31:46.198
actually went horizontal
and into my chest

31:47.282 --> 31:50.202
My head had banged up
against the metal side

31:50.327 --> 31:53.288
of the interior of the car.

31:53.538 --> 31:56.541
My right leg
was broken at the knee,

31:57.000 --> 32:00.504
but I must have slid on
the seat a little sideways

32:01.171 --> 32:02.881
because it hit
from that angle.

32:03.006 --> 32:06.051
And when it did, it
literally severed my left

32:06.176 --> 32:09.179
leg just above the knee,

32:10.097 --> 32:13.225
and four and a half
inches of the femur

32:13.558 --> 32:17.062
was ejected from the car
and actually never found.

32:17.938 --> 32:19.314
I had been
killed instantly.

32:19.439 --> 32:21.566
My heart was not beating,

32:21.692 --> 32:23.318
so it was not
pumping blood.

32:24.611 --> 32:27.614
I died on the bridge.

32:34.079 --> 32:37.082
Dr. Neal: I'm a board certified
orthopedic spine surgeon

32:37.833 --> 32:42.754
and physicians
spend their entire career

32:44.172 --> 32:45.549
evading death.

32:45.674 --> 32:49.052
We believe that
if we are smart enough,

32:49.428 --> 32:51.346
if we are
well-trained enough,

32:51.471 --> 32:54.808
and if we do a good enough
job that we can control

32:54.933 --> 32:57.936
the outcomes, that we can
control the variables

32:58.061 --> 33:01.064
and we can cheat death.

33:03.775 --> 33:06.862
My husband and I
were avid kayakers.

33:07.946 --> 33:10.031
Kayaking is

33:10.157 --> 33:13.160
both challenging
and exhilarating.

33:13.618 --> 33:16.371
We began to go down
the river.

33:16.496 --> 33:19.124
We went over
the first couple of drops.

33:19.249 --> 33:22.294
It was very high flow,
very high

33:22.419 --> 33:24.421
current, strong current.

33:24.546 --> 33:27.257
There is another client
that sort of bobbled

33:27.382 --> 33:29.301
her way past me and

33:29.426 --> 33:32.429
ended up sideways at the
entrance to the chute.

33:33.263 --> 33:36.183
So my only option
was to veer over

33:36.308 --> 33:38.435
and go over the
main part of the waterfall

33:43.064 --> 33:45.192
and the
front end of my boat

33:45.317 --> 33:48.278
became pinned

33:51.531 --> 33:53.325
and the boat and I
were then

33:53.450 --> 33:56.953
completely submerged under
8 to 10 feet of water.

34:04.711 --> 34:08.006
I recognized that I was
probably going to drown.

34:12.469 --> 34:15.388
I would think about
the fact that

34:15.514 --> 34:18.558
I must be dead,
but I didn't feel dead.

34:19.351 --> 34:22.312
I felt more alive
than I've ever felt.

34:24.689 --> 34:27.150
I felt this
incredible experience

34:27.275 --> 34:30.195
like I was just
part of the water.

34:30.737 --> 34:33.740
I felt magnificent, actually.

34:34.783 --> 34:37.869
I knew that
I was being held by Christ

34:39.079 --> 34:42.082
as purely as I know,

34:42.457 --> 34:43.708
anything.

34:45.418 --> 34:48.004
I know it sounds crazy,

34:48.129 --> 34:52.217
but it's just
something that

34:53.260 --> 34:56.263
is outside of our language.

34:57.472 --> 34:59.975
Peter Panagore: We went up a
world famous climb,

35:00.100 --> 35:02.602
maybe 500 feet,
three pitches up

35:02.727 --> 35:04.479
David Ditchfield: As the train
started pulling out,

35:04.604 --> 35:06.481
I just thought, This is it.
I'm going to die.

35:06.606 --> 35:08.650
I took a corner
to a 90 miles

35:08.775 --> 35:11.236
an hour, flipped over,
and it landed on the top.

35:11.361 --> 35:13.655
All I remember seeing was a
big white, white light.

35:13.780 --> 35:15.907
The knife had gone all
the way through my liver.

35:16.032 --> 35:19.077
I had a punctured lung and
I started feeling myself

35:19.744 --> 35:20.745
leave my body.

35:20.871 --> 35:22.747
You were in the hospital
bed, right?

35:22.873 --> 35:24.457
But you had left your body
and you

35:24.583 --> 35:26.501
Betty Eadie: My body was on
the bed and my spirit ...

35:26.626 --> 35:28.169
and I could see
in every direction.

35:28.295 --> 35:30.005
Up on the ceiling
looking down.

35:30.130 --> 35:32.883
There was this feeling of a
presence. It felt like God

35:33.008 --> 35:34.801
Not like this guy
up in the sky.

35:34.968 --> 35:36.011
And that was God.

35:36.136 --> 35:37.137
I just know it was God

35:37.262 --> 35:39.097
The meaning of life,
of everything,

35:39.222 --> 35:41.182
It was unlike anything
I've ever experienced.

35:41.308 --> 35:42.893
I have no fear of death.

35:43.018 --> 35:45.604
...it's with total knowledge
and unconditional love...

35:45.729 --> 35:48.607
It was all the love that
is in the universe.

35:48.773 --> 35:50.901
Death is not the end.
It's probably the beginning.

35:51.026 --> 35:52.319
I looked into his eyes,
It was like

35:52.444 --> 35:54.404
I was looking
at forever inside of him,

35:54.529 --> 35:55.822
and I could see the love
he had for me.

35:55.947 --> 35:57.657
You know,
people don't believe you

35:57.782 --> 36:00.285
when you say the story,
but it's just so real.

36:03.955 --> 36:07.125
Dr. Neal: Almost 30 minutes
had gone by.

36:07.292 --> 36:11.296
Enough time had passed
that they had shifted from

36:11.796 --> 36:15.216
a rescue mode to purely
a body recovery mode.

36:16.176 --> 36:20.221
I could see this
bloated purple body

36:20.347 --> 36:24.434
and I never felt alive
and then dead.

36:24.559 --> 36:27.646
I never felt conscious
and unconscious.

36:28.063 --> 36:30.774
I felt conscious
and then more conscious

36:30.899 --> 36:35.153
I felt alive
and then more alive.

36:37.280 --> 36:40.909
Dr. Sabom: I came into this
thing skeptical, mean

36:41.034 --> 36:43.995
I could have very easily
blown this whole thing off.

36:44.120 --> 36:45.580
If you go
to the resuscitation

36:45.705 --> 36:46.790
for 20 minutes

36:46.915 --> 36:47.582
and you've been

36:47.707 --> 36:50.627
without oxygen
for 20 minutes or whatever,

36:51.544 --> 36:53.838
you're going to lose
some neurons,

36:53.964 --> 36:55.173
You're going to
have brain damage.

36:55.298 --> 36:56.967
You may not
live either.

36:57.092 --> 36:59.761
You'll die a
neurologic death

36:59.886 --> 37:02.847
general rule is, the longer
without the oxygen.

37:03.181 --> 37:06.851
Normally, the more brain
damage you're going to have,

37:07.227 --> 37:10.897
and it's progressive
until it's restored.

37:12.190 --> 37:14.317
CBS News: A new study may
provide answers

37:14.442 --> 37:15.527
to the age old question

37:15.652 --> 37:18.613
What happens to our brains
when we die?

37:20.615 --> 37:24.661
Dr. Zemmar: The brain has always
been the most fascinating

37:24.869 --> 37:26.079
and the most interesting

37:26.204 --> 37:27.956
organ to me
because to the world

37:28.081 --> 37:30.208
it is completely
unexplored.

37:30.333 --> 37:32.252
I was working in Vancouver
at the Vancouver

37:32.377 --> 37:33.378
General Hospital.

37:33.503 --> 37:35.797
This was the 87 year
old gentleman.

37:35.922 --> 37:38.842
He came during
the emergency shift

37:39.426 --> 37:43.304
with a bleed between
the brain and the skull.

37:43.430 --> 37:46.391
We call it
a subdural hematoma.

37:46.725 --> 37:49.019
And we decided to operate.

37:49.144 --> 37:50.687
We removed the skull.

37:50.812 --> 37:52.022
We removed the bleeding.

37:52.147 --> 37:53.815
He did fairly well
after the surgery

37:53.940 --> 37:55.859
for about three days.

37:56.109 --> 37:58.737
And then he started
having seizures.

37:58.862 --> 38:02.574
So we went and applied
an EEG to see

38:02.699 --> 38:04.701
where the seizures
are coming from

38:04.826 --> 38:06.327
and how to treat them.

38:06.453 --> 38:08.329
Once we had this applied,

38:08.621 --> 38:10.457
he had a heart
attack and died.

38:12.625 --> 38:14.669
So that left us with

38:14.794 --> 38:18.214
the rare recording
of the human brain

38:18.339 --> 38:20.050
that went from a life
to death.

38:21.051 --> 38:24.763
It's the first ever
recording of a dying human

38:24.888 --> 38:27.891
brain, one that happened
entirely by chance.

38:28.016 --> 38:29.851
We've heard about people

38:29.976 --> 38:32.395
before who have faced
near death experiences.

38:32.520 --> 38:34.522
Describe this moment

38:34.647 --> 38:36.232
where they were
the important moments

38:36.357 --> 38:38.234
in their life
flashed before their head.

38:38.359 --> 38:39.778
Is that
what we're talking about?

38:39.903 --> 38:41.488
Is that what this is?

38:41.613 --> 38:42.781
- Dr.
From what
this case of

38:42.906 --> 38:43.740
One tells us

38:43.865 --> 38:45.784
all the things
they are consistently

38:45.909 --> 38:48.495
being described
by people who undergo

38:48.620 --> 38:50.080
near-death experience.

38:50.205 --> 38:52.916
These guys have exhibited
these brain waves

38:53.041 --> 38:55.960
that exactly the same ones
we're measuring

38:56.086 --> 38:59.464
when we record the activity
of this patient

38:59.839 --> 39:00.507
30 seconds

39:00.632 --> 39:02.217
before the heart stops
beating

39:02.342 --> 39:05.303
and 30 seconds after
the heart stops beating,

39:05.720 --> 39:07.889
that we found
was quite astonishing.

39:08.932 --> 39:11.101
After searching
and searching,

39:11.226 --> 39:14.437
we had not found anybody
at the time when we wrote

39:14.562 --> 39:16.481
the manuscript
and submitted it

39:16.606 --> 39:19.901
that had full brain
recordings

39:20.026 --> 39:21.820
from the dying human brain.

39:21.945 --> 39:24.948
Under acute
clinical environments.

39:25.615 --> 39:28.743
brain waves
are always present

39:29.035 --> 39:31.746
in our brain.

39:31.871 --> 39:34.999
They differ in frequency,

39:35.125 --> 39:39.629
meaning how many times
per second they oscillate.

39:40.004 --> 39:44.884
The high frequency waves
are called gamma waves.

39:45.510 --> 39:48.138
Then the lower ones
we call them

39:48.263 --> 39:51.266
beta, theta,
alpha and delta waves.

39:51.641 --> 39:54.811
Those are slower
frequent oscillations.

39:54.936 --> 39:58.940
We found
an increased interplay

39:59.065 --> 40:02.026
of these oscillatory bands
with each other.

40:03.361 --> 40:06.573
We looked at how this,
for example,

40:07.323 --> 40:10.743
theta waves that are
known for memory recall,

40:10.869 --> 40:14.539
how do they couple
with gamma waves?

40:14.956 --> 40:17.542
And we found an increased
coupling of the

40:17.667 --> 40:20.545
two after a heart
stopped beating.

40:20.670 --> 40:23.464
The brain is a prediction
machine that is designed

40:23.590 --> 40:24.424
for survival.

40:25.592 --> 40:26.634
So we see something,

40:26.759 --> 40:27.886
we interpret the signal,

40:28.011 --> 40:29.637
we generate a response

40:30.388 --> 40:33.850
in all kinds of responses
that the brain generates.

40:34.809 --> 40:38.605
The only one we can measure
right now is movement.

40:39.898 --> 40:42.775
We can't measure
what we call thinking.

40:42.901 --> 40:44.360
Can you measure emotions?

40:44.485 --> 40:45.153
Feelings?

40:45.278 --> 40:46.321
I don't know what
to answer you.

40:46.446 --> 40:48.239
We can't measure
all these things.

40:48.364 --> 40:51.367
We know that the brain
somehow does these things.

40:51.993 --> 40:53.077
We may never understand

40:53.203 --> 40:54.621
what exactly happens.

40:54.746 --> 40:56.080
And maybe that's not the most

40:56.206 --> 40:57.916
important thing either.

40:58.499 --> 40:59.626
If the science

40:59.751 --> 41:02.587
can contribute even
a minute percentage

41:02.712 --> 41:04.797
and can shed light

41:04.923 --> 41:08.218
on the nature
of the human brain dying.

41:08.593 --> 41:10.011
If I could go to
my patients

41:10.136 --> 41:11.554
and I could tell them,

41:11.679 --> 41:15.308
it may be that your loved
one is replaying

41:15.433 --> 41:17.268
some of the memories
of their life.

41:18.895 --> 41:21.898
It somehow
makes things easier.

41:22.106 --> 41:24.776
It tells them
they're not suffering.

41:24.901 --> 41:27.862
That, I think, would help
patients in that

41:27.987 --> 41:30.949
tremendously
difficult time.

41:41.459 --> 41:43.378
Growing up in South Korea.

41:43.503 --> 41:45.004
I grew up in a
Buddhist home.

41:45.129 --> 41:46.506
Ever since the age
of six, seven,

41:46.631 --> 41:50.551
I was asking questions
like, Why are humans made?

41:50.677 --> 41:52.679
Why are we born?

41:52.804 --> 41:55.223
What is the purpose
of mankind?

41:55.348 --> 41:57.392
Why am I here?

41:57.517 --> 41:58.935
The Buddhist
monks at the temple

41:59.060 --> 42:00.561
would say things like,
Oh yeah, Steve,

42:00.687 --> 42:02.397
you can go to heaven,
you can go to hell,

42:02.522 --> 42:03.314
come back,

42:03.439 --> 42:04.482
you can get reincarnated

42:04.607 --> 42:06.567
into an animal
or a different species.

42:06.693 --> 42:08.528
They taught you how to do
right and do wrong,

42:08.653 --> 42:10.697
and try to earn
your salvation.

42:10.822 --> 42:13.658
My mother, who was trained
as a registered nurse,

42:13.783 --> 42:14.450
she got recruited

42:14.575 --> 42:17.537
by a VA veterans
hospital in Boston.

42:18.371 --> 42:20.081
You know, she prepared
the way for us to come.

42:20.206 --> 42:22.458
So I came with my younger
brother in elementary school.

42:26.671 --> 42:27.463
The older I got,

42:27.588 --> 42:30.091
middle school and
even up to freshman year,

42:30.216 --> 42:31.968
and I remember
feeling a lot of confusion.

42:32.093 --> 42:33.803
I remember looking
in the mirror and saying,

42:33.928 --> 42:35.513
How come I'm the only one?

42:35.638 --> 42:37.849
How come I have
to be Korean?

42:37.974 --> 42:40.393
And it was a big struggle
and led me to become

42:40.518 --> 42:41.352
a little rebellious.

42:41.477 --> 42:44.188
Like I joined the garage
band. I tried to...

42:44.314 --> 42:45.356
I think I tried
a little harder

42:45.481 --> 42:48.443
than others
to try to fit in.

42:49.235 --> 42:51.779
And I just remember,
you know, always feeling

42:51.904 --> 42:54.782
a little empty, feeling
confusion and emptiness.

42:54.907 --> 42:56.242
You know, from high school.

42:59.037 --> 43:00.997
I remember
in the summer of 1998,

43:01.122 --> 43:03.041
we will get high
in the morning,

43:03.166 --> 43:05.752
in the afternoon, in the
evening, the whole summer.

43:05.877 --> 43:08.254
I don't remember
being sober for an hour.

43:08.379 --> 43:11.215
And my mom and brother
were getting super worried.

43:11.341 --> 43:12.842
I called the Buddhist
temple for help.

43:12.967 --> 43:14.052
They didn't help either.

43:14.177 --> 43:14.969
So I realized, like,

43:15.094 --> 43:18.556
this is something that is
beyond my power ability to

43:19.015 --> 43:20.683
to to save myself from.

43:23.019 --> 43:24.687
You know, people
say when they see demons

43:24.812 --> 43:26.230
or evil spirits,
they might think

43:26.356 --> 43:28.941
somebody comes
with a pitchfork and horns.

43:29.067 --> 43:30.485
But I had an open eye

43:30.610 --> 43:32.653
vision of all Asian
grandpa coming.

43:32.779 --> 43:34.572
He's talking to me
like I'm talking to you.

43:34.697 --> 43:35.490
He said, Hey, Steve,
I know you're

43:35.615 --> 43:36.366
having a hard time.

43:36.532 --> 43:39.660
If you commit suicide
and take your own life,

43:40.036 --> 43:42.997
then I can give you 50,000
less years of hell.

43:43.122 --> 43:44.707
And I'm like,
That's a great deal.

43:46.501 --> 43:47.960
I went to the kitchen.

43:48.086 --> 43:50.171
I grabbed the biggest
knife I could find.

43:50.296 --> 43:52.131
Got on my knees.

43:52.256 --> 43:53.091
So I grabbed a knife

43:53.216 --> 43:54.842
and I cut my
neck open here,

43:55.426 --> 43:58.096
which, you know,
was very painful.

43:58.429 --> 44:00.098
My mom sees the
event happening,

44:00.223 --> 44:01.933
so she calls 911.

44:02.058 --> 44:04.102
The cops came,
and then there's

44:04.227 --> 44:06.229
the Grandpa spirit is
still there speaking to me,

44:06.354 --> 44:07.105
says, Steve,
you got to hurry up.

44:07.230 --> 44:08.523
You're going
to miss your chance.

44:08.648 --> 44:09.440
Go for the stomach.

44:09.565 --> 44:14.153
So I cut my stomach open,
which actually is,

44:14.320 --> 44:16.406
you know, the scars
go down all the way here.

44:16.531 --> 44:18.741
I lost a big part
of my blood.

44:19.909 --> 44:22.912
The cops came
and whacked me with a bat.

44:23.204 --> 44:24.997
I dropped the knife.

44:25.123 --> 44:27.583
I remember
losing consciousness.

44:27.708 --> 44:29.001
The whole living was
bloody red.

44:29.127 --> 44:31.796
My mom was crying.
I remember hearing her.

44:31.921 --> 44:33.005
They put me
in the stretcher

44:33.131 --> 44:34.882
because already I'm
very damaged.

44:35.007 --> 44:37.260
I'm losing blood,
like at a very fast rate

44:37.385 --> 44:39.387
and I'm going in of conscious.

44:39.512 --> 44:41.222
The grandpa spirits gone

44:41.347 --> 44:43.641
and then it was just into
the unknown after that.

44:44.225 --> 44:45.435
I remember coming out,

44:45.852 --> 44:49.480
seeing my body and then
seeing the E.R. room.

44:49.605 --> 44:53.943
I remember going through
just darkness, like even

44:54.068 --> 44:57.071
seeing rocks and stones
around me just falling.

44:57.738 --> 45:00.241
It just felt like I was
falling in an elevator.

45:00.366 --> 45:03.327
And I don't know how to
put it into words exactly,

45:03.661 --> 45:05.455
but I knew I was going
to a different place.

45:05.580 --> 45:07.123
There was still real,

45:07.248 --> 45:09.292
more real than anything
here on Earth.

45:09.417 --> 45:10.585
I was still fully
conscious.

45:10.710 --> 45:11.627
Everything's happening,

45:11.752 --> 45:13.129
but now it's like

45:13.254 --> 45:14.380
there's different
set of rules,

45:14.505 --> 45:17.300
there's a different set
of awarenesses.

45:17.425 --> 45:19.093
And you're saying
goodbye to Earth.

45:19.218 --> 45:21.179
I knew I was saying
goodbye to Earth.

45:21.304 --> 45:24.265
And going to
another place of eternity.

45:24.515 --> 45:26.893
And then God came to me
and like a ball of light,

45:27.018 --> 45:28.603
that became
like a triangle.

45:29.437 --> 45:31.689
Behind it I saw the city,

45:31.814 --> 45:34.025
I looked up and it was
glittering like gold.

45:34.150 --> 45:35.359
The walls were gold.

45:36.736 --> 45:37.612
I don't know how it works,

45:37.737 --> 45:40.656
but it's definitely
a place we go.

45:42.200 --> 45:44.118
I heard a voice
before I woke up.

45:44.243 --> 45:45.661
I love you.

45:45.786 --> 45:48.748
And I open my eyes and I'm
in the emergency room.

45:48.873 --> 45:51.667
I was like,
Oh my God, I'm alive.

45:51.792 --> 45:53.294
So first of all, I was
so thankful I was alive.

45:53.419 --> 45:55.671
I look around,
my mom's there,

45:55.796 --> 45:58.508
she's crying, grabbing
my hand, son, you know,

45:58.633 --> 46:00.635
you, you regained
consciousness.

46:00.760 --> 46:03.054
And I was still trying
to process what happened,

46:03.179 --> 46:04.597
but I just knew
I was back on Earth.

46:06.724 --> 46:09.352
They said it took two
surgeries to cover

46:09.477 --> 46:10.645
the blood vessels
that were cut.

46:10.770 --> 46:13.397
A specialist had to fly in
at the last minute,

46:13.523 --> 46:15.024
and if he was late,
they told me I would

46:15.149 --> 46:16.359
have been bye, bye forever.

46:16.484 --> 46:18.402
My heart and blood wouldn't
go back up.

46:18.528 --> 46:20.112
We just kept
sinking, sinking, sinking,

46:20.238 --> 46:21.572
during the whole surgery.

46:21.697 --> 46:23.199
And they said
it was a miracle.

46:23.324 --> 46:24.242
Good timing.

46:28.913 --> 46:32.291
I know one thing, we all
live once and die once.

46:32.416 --> 46:34.794
And there is
judgment after.

46:42.552 --> 46:43.386
Dr. Sabom: I think
that there are

46:43.511 --> 46:47.306
a lot of people that do
take advantage of this.

46:47.598 --> 46:49.850
The novelty
and the fascination

46:49.976 --> 46:52.853
of this experience.

46:52.979 --> 46:55.064
We're all to die
and we all want to know

46:55.189 --> 46:56.732
what's going to happen
once that happens.

46:56.857 --> 46:57.900
So, I mean,

46:58.025 --> 47:01.612
this is speaking to us all.
And of great importance.

47:02.738 --> 47:05.741
That can be abused.

47:06.951 --> 47:09.412
Some of these these cases

47:09.537 --> 47:11.872
are transmitted through

47:11.998 --> 47:14.709
several different people
before they get in print.

47:14.834 --> 47:16.252
And they get
a lot of attention

47:16.377 --> 47:17.461
because they're fantastic.

47:17.587 --> 47:19.046
But what I've tried to

47:19.171 --> 47:22.466
do is remove
some of the subjectivity

47:23.134 --> 47:26.053
to these experiences.

47:26.178 --> 47:28.347
And put data out there

47:28.472 --> 47:31.892
that's been scientifically,
rigorously collected.

47:32.977 --> 47:34.812
There's no way
you can verify

47:34.937 --> 47:37.315
the transcendental part
of the experience.

47:37.440 --> 47:38.899
The person feels like they go

47:39.025 --> 47:41.360
to an otherworldly
environment

47:41.485 --> 47:42.987
as opposed
to their environment

47:43.112 --> 47:44.822
right there in the room
with them.

47:44.947 --> 47:46.949
Mr. Burke: What really convinced
me and what convinced

47:47.074 --> 47:51.162
many skeptical doctors,
oncologist, cardiologist,

47:51.412 --> 47:54.999
is that when people
initially leave their body,

47:55.291 --> 47:56.626
they say that many times

47:56.751 --> 47:57.835
they were in the room

47:57.960 --> 48:00.880
still where they were being
resuscitated or worked on

48:01.047 --> 48:01.714
many times up

48:01.839 --> 48:04.759
near the ceiling,
looking down, watching.

48:04.925 --> 48:07.053
They felt incredible peace,
even though

48:07.178 --> 48:08.137
it was chaotic.

48:09.513 --> 48:11.098
oftentimes in the room

48:11.223 --> 48:13.225
where they were
working on their body,

48:14.226 --> 48:16.437
When they would come back,

48:16.562 --> 48:19.523
they were able to give
corroborative evidence

48:19.982 --> 48:21.609
that they actually saw

48:21.734 --> 48:22.860
what was going on
in the room,

48:22.985 --> 48:24.654
even though
they were unconscious

48:24.779 --> 48:26.947
at the time they
were worked on.

48:27.073 --> 48:30.034
They shouldn't have
been able to see this.

48:30.493 --> 48:33.829
Dr. Sabom: Autoscopic means
self-visualization.

48:33.954 --> 48:37.375
They were visualizing
themself from the ceiling,

48:37.541 --> 48:41.128
lying in bed, lifeless,
or being resuscitated.

48:42.546 --> 48:45.174
That is the verifiable part

48:45.299 --> 48:47.426
of a near-death experience,
where you can go back

48:47.551 --> 48:49.345
and either verify what
they said they saw

48:49.470 --> 48:51.222
or what
actually occurred.

48:51.347 --> 48:53.349
And that's what I wanted.

48:53.474 --> 48:54.517
That was the main thing

48:54.642 --> 48:56.769
that got me hooked
on this thing.

48:56.894 --> 48:58.771
And I paid
very little attention

48:58.896 --> 49:01.399
to the tunnel, the light,
the deceased relatives

49:01.524 --> 49:03.818
and friends,
the religious figures.

49:03.943 --> 49:07.196
For me as a
cardiologist, scientist,

49:07.321 --> 49:08.489
and a physician,

49:08.614 --> 49:10.199
I wanted some verification,

49:10.324 --> 49:12.034
I wanted
some medical records.

49:12.159 --> 49:14.870
I wanted to talk to people
who had been there

49:14.995 --> 49:17.998
and seen what had
happened in the room.

49:26.382 --> 49:27.842
Dr. Greene: Back in
the early 1990s,

49:27.967 --> 49:30.553
when I was a resident
training and neurosurgery

49:30.678 --> 49:33.681
at Phoenix and at the Barrow
Neurological Institute,

49:33.806 --> 49:36.392
one of the best places
to go in the world.

49:36.517 --> 49:39.437
It was a destination center
for neurosurgery.

49:40.146 --> 49:41.522
I was on the Chairman
Service,

49:41.647 --> 49:44.066
Dr. Robert Spetzler

49:44.191 --> 49:47.403
and Dr. Spetzler is
world renowned.

49:47.528 --> 49:49.196
There was a patient
who came to him

49:49.321 --> 49:51.240
named Pamela Reynolds,

49:52.575 --> 49:55.119
Dr. Spetzler: What we're looking
at is the aneurysm that she had.

49:55.244 --> 49:57.246
Which is at the very
base of the brain.

49:57.371 --> 49:59.331
This is the balloon
that can burst

49:59.457 --> 50:02.209
and cause this
incredible catastrophe.

50:02.334 --> 50:05.045
It's all the way at the
very base of the brain.

50:05.171 --> 50:06.839
And that is why it's so

50:06.964 --> 50:08.466
incredibly difficult
to get there.

50:08.591 --> 50:10.593
Dr. Greene: The anatomical
location of the basal

50:10.718 --> 50:13.721
artery is a neurosurgeons
no man's land.

50:14.472 --> 50:16.432
She underwent an operation.

50:16.557 --> 50:17.308
Again,

50:17.433 --> 50:20.060
pretty unusual operation
called cardiac standstill.

50:20.186 --> 50:22.021
I came in several times
into the operating room

50:22.146 --> 50:23.355
because it's a cardiac

50:23.481 --> 50:25.483
standstill case
and they're fascinating.

50:25.608 --> 50:28.402
Dr. Sabom: If you were going to
do a laboratory experiment,

50:28.527 --> 50:30.196
this is the perfect
experiment.

50:30.321 --> 50:32.198
She was put on the
operating room table

50:32.323 --> 50:35.284
and immediately put under
general anesthesia.

50:35.743 --> 50:38.120
Dr. Greene: The cardiac
standstill operation requires

50:38.245 --> 50:41.248
teams of medical providers,
surgical providers,

50:41.457 --> 50:42.750
all of which is designed to:

50:42.875 --> 50:46.045
1. drop the temperature of
a person's body.

50:46.170 --> 50:49.507
2. Drain out all the blood
out of their body.

50:49.632 --> 50:53.552
3. Keep them in a state
of suspended animation,

50:54.011 --> 50:55.888
shut down brain function.

50:56.013 --> 50:57.640
And you've actually
stopped the heart.

51:00.100 --> 51:02.520
Dr. Sabom: They had these things
in her ears

51:02.645 --> 51:06.524
that emitted 95 to 100
decibel clicks.

51:06.649 --> 51:08.192
If the click went off

51:08.317 --> 51:11.403
and you saw spike
on the EEG

51:11.529 --> 51:13.781
that was measuring
the brain stem,

51:13.906 --> 51:16.534
then you knew
the brainstem was active.

51:16.659 --> 51:18.077
Dr. Greene: No heart
that's beating,

51:18.202 --> 51:21.831
a brain that's no
longer functioning.

51:21.956 --> 51:23.415
Dr. Sabom: And what they had to
do is get it

51:23.541 --> 51:26.377
so that those clicks
were eliciting no

51:26.502 --> 51:29.421
brainstem reactivity, i.e.

51:29.547 --> 51:31.006
it was flatlined.

51:32.508 --> 51:35.261
So was pretty
much totally isolated

51:35.386 --> 51:37.638
from the environment
physically.

51:37.763 --> 51:41.183
And medically,
she was in a--

51:41.308 --> 51:43.686
that's why they call
procedure standstill.

51:43.811 --> 51:45.563
Everything
was at a standstill.

51:46.814 --> 51:47.982
Tom Wilkinson: She would be
clinically dead

51:48.107 --> 51:50.317
for a whole hour
of the operation.

51:52.444 --> 51:55.281
Dr. Sabom: She had a three part
near-death experience.

51:55.406 --> 51:57.741
The first part
was out-of-body,

51:57.867 --> 51:59.285
autoscopic part,

51:59.410 --> 52:02.663
When Spetzler first started
up the brain saw

52:03.414 --> 52:06.208
she heard the conversation
between Spetzler and

52:06.333 --> 52:07.501
the surgeon

52:07.626 --> 52:09.753
about the artery
being too small

52:09.879 --> 52:11.005
in her right
femoral artery,

52:11.130 --> 52:13.549
and they had to switch
over to the left.

52:13.674 --> 52:14.717
The visual part.

52:14.842 --> 52:18.721
She saw the bone saw,
which I didn't even know

52:18.846 --> 52:21.765
what it looked like myself
as a cardiologist.

52:21.891 --> 52:23.475
And I was then
looking down at the body.

52:23.601 --> 52:26.937
I knew it was my body,
but I didn't care.

52:27.688 --> 52:29.815
My vantage
point was sort of

52:29.940 --> 52:32.067
sitting on the doctor's
shoulder.

52:32.192 --> 52:35.279
I remember the instrument
in his hand.

52:36.113 --> 52:39.909
It looked like the handle
of my electric toothbrush.

52:40.034 --> 52:42.995
Dr. Sabom: And then she said
that there was this tray

52:43.495 --> 52:47.291
of instruments
to the right of Spetzler,

52:47.541 --> 52:50.252
that it looked like
the socket wrench set that

52:50.377 --> 52:51.587
her father used to have.

52:53.130 --> 52:56.091
And then the other stuff
was the same autoscopic.

52:56.216 --> 52:58.427
And in between
those two experiences,

52:58.552 --> 52:59.637
which she relates

52:59.762 --> 53:02.765
the experience
as a continuous experience,

53:03.390 --> 53:05.225
she had the transcendental
experience.

53:05.351 --> 53:06.560
I felt a presence.

53:06.685 --> 53:08.062
I sort of turned around

53:08.187 --> 53:10.564
to look at a
pin-point of light.

53:10.689 --> 53:12.858
Dr. Sabom: Well, how do you know
the transcendental

53:12.983 --> 53:14.610
experience happened

53:14.735 --> 53:16.779
when the blood was drained
out of her head?

53:16.904 --> 53:18.906
Well, you don't.

53:19.031 --> 53:21.283
All you can do is infer it.

53:21.408 --> 53:22.576
You can't prove it.

53:22.701 --> 53:24.745
The other two are
time anchored.

53:24.870 --> 53:27.081
The middle is not.

53:30.084 --> 53:31.377
Dr. Greene: Pam came back,

53:32.169 --> 53:34.296
I believe,
the following day.

53:35.214 --> 53:36.882
As with every patient,
I'm rounding on her

53:37.007 --> 53:39.635
in the intensive care unit
before the chairman rounds

53:39.760 --> 53:42.763
and she's awake
talking with me.

53:43.263 --> 53:44.515
You know, usually ask the

53:44.640 --> 53:45.975
typical questions
How are you feeling?

53:46.100 --> 53:48.644
after that tube was removed
from her by extubation

53:48.769 --> 53:50.396
and she was able
to control her airway

53:50.521 --> 53:52.564
and she was becoming
more lucid?

53:52.690 --> 53:54.692
Well, she
had a lot to talk about.

53:55.693 --> 53:56.652
She began to

53:56.777 --> 53:59.780
describe some details
about her operation.

54:00.322 --> 54:02.533
And as she spoke,

54:02.658 --> 54:04.868
I became spooked.

54:07.246 --> 54:09.707
She talked about her
blood vessels and her

54:09.832 --> 54:12.793
groin, being canulated
and being too small.

54:14.336 --> 54:17.297
She talked about her
heart being shocked twice.

54:18.549 --> 54:21.552
Giving me details that
she just shouldn't know.

54:22.052 --> 54:25.055
I sort of put the kibosh
on the conversation.

54:25.723 --> 54:28.017
"Pam, you need
to get some rest.

54:28.142 --> 54:29.643
I'll come back later."

54:29.768 --> 54:30.686
I went to my chairman

54:30.811 --> 54:33.480
and told Dr. Spetzler,

54:33.605 --> 54:35.858
"You need to talk
with Pam Reynolds.

54:36.692 --> 54:39.695
She's describing stuff that
she just shouldn't know.

54:40.195 --> 54:42.698
This ain't right."

54:44.074 --> 54:45.034
Functionally speaking,

54:45.159 --> 54:46.952
Pam, was dead.

54:47.995 --> 54:50.873
Dr. Moody: Typically, when
people are coming out of a dream

54:50.998 --> 54:51.707
in the morning,

54:51.832 --> 54:54.752
they feel like they're
coming back to reality.

54:55.085 --> 54:58.505
But people who have
a near-death experience

54:58.630 --> 55:01.383
say that is they
go into that experience,

55:01.633 --> 55:04.511
it's this life
that becomes dreamlike.

55:04.636 --> 55:07.598
People feel that
when they, from the world's

55:07.723 --> 55:11.435
point of view, are dying,
they actually are waking up

55:11.935 --> 55:15.230
to a reality that
this state of existence

55:15.355 --> 55:17.900
that we're in now
seemed like a dream or

55:18.025 --> 55:19.318
as though you're asleep.

55:25.115 --> 55:25.991
Dr. Sabom: I think
the near-death

55:26.116 --> 55:29.286
experience is where
science meets religion.

55:29.411 --> 55:32.372
There is a big difference
between proof and evidence.

55:32.581 --> 55:34.124
This is all evidence,

55:34.249 --> 55:36.794
but enough evidence
at some point

55:36.919 --> 55:42.508
makes it so close to proof
that most people would say

55:43.884 --> 55:44.593
it's right,

55:44.718 --> 55:46.136
it's real.

55:48.680 --> 55:51.683
I got to watch what I say
because I don't want to

55:51.934 --> 55:54.937
unnecessarily
alienate people.

55:55.145 --> 55:57.981
I think skepticism is good

55:58.107 --> 56:00.025
skepticism, true
skepticism.

56:00.150 --> 56:02.236
But rigidity is not.

56:02.361 --> 56:04.113
In other words,
if you have an

56:04.238 --> 56:07.282
ideological opposition
to something

56:07.825 --> 56:11.370
and you fight tooth
and nail to support it,

56:11.578 --> 56:14.581
or at least advocate it

56:15.374 --> 56:17.543
and refuse
to look at the other side,

56:17.668 --> 56:19.086
that's not being objective.

56:19.211 --> 56:20.796
Dr. Long: There's a lot
about the afterlife

56:20.921 --> 56:22.381
that we don't know
for sure.

56:22.506 --> 56:25.384
We'll all know for real
only after we die.

56:25.509 --> 56:27.553
And not completely
before then.

56:28.137 --> 56:30.806
Mr. Burke: There have been lots
of alternate theories

56:30.931 --> 56:32.850
fighter pilots syndrome.

56:34.226 --> 56:34.893
You're pulling G's,

56:35.018 --> 56:37.020
It feels like you're
going through a tunnel.

56:37.146 --> 56:38.021
Some say

56:38.147 --> 56:41.775
psychedelic drugs like
DMT or LSD or mescaline,

56:42.776 --> 56:45.070
vibrant colors and, and,

56:45.195 --> 56:48.157
maybe going to
another place,

56:48.740 --> 56:51.660
Dr. Long: You name it, DMT,
Ketamine, LSD,

56:51.785 --> 56:52.911
those are

56:53.036 --> 56:55.622
generally illicit
substances that produce

56:55.747 --> 56:56.790
hallucinatory effects.

56:56.915 --> 56:58.375
And in fact, many people

56:58.500 --> 57:00.377
that take these
illicit substances

57:00.502 --> 57:03.380
and the difference between
the experience they have

57:03.505 --> 57:06.175
and the typical near-death
experience

57:06.300 --> 57:07.676
is very striking.

57:08.385 --> 57:11.013
Mr. Burke: The problem is that

57:11.138 --> 57:14.516
all of those might describe
one aspect.

57:16.101 --> 57:19.062
You have people
and we're talking thousands

57:19.188 --> 57:22.900
and thousands of people
all around the globe, old,

57:23.025 --> 57:26.612
young, sighted
people, blind people.

57:27.112 --> 57:29.489
And they're saying
the same thing,

57:29.615 --> 57:32.367
though on the other side,
blind people can see

57:32.492 --> 57:35.120
they have to adjust to it,
to describing things

57:35.245 --> 57:38.081
that they see, but
they see the same things.

57:38.207 --> 57:41.251
And there was one study
done with 23 blind people,

57:41.376 --> 57:43.962
14 of them
blind from birth,

57:44.087 --> 57:45.214
two of them that I report

57:45.339 --> 57:48.300
about describe the light
coming out of everything.

57:49.092 --> 57:51.386
Dr. Long: There's the near-death
experience of Marta.

57:51.511 --> 57:54.848
She was a five-year-old
girl and totally blind.

57:55.307 --> 57:58.060
Marta went into a lake
and drowned,

57:58.185 --> 58:00.896
and her consciousness rose
above her body.

58:01.021 --> 58:04.274
She described vividly
details of birds' feathers,

58:04.399 --> 58:07.319
birds' eyes,
details on telephone poles.

58:07.486 --> 58:10.697
It's remarkable to me
how someone totally blind

58:11.114 --> 58:12.199
can be fascinated

58:12.324 --> 58:14.660
by mundane
things that you and I

58:14.785 --> 58:16.536
would not consider
to be so exciting.

58:16.662 --> 58:18.789
Seeing this
for the first time

58:18.914 --> 58:20.999
while she's unconscious

58:21.124 --> 58:23.001
and below the
surface of the water

58:23.126 --> 58:25.629
and yet having a
near-death experience.

58:25.754 --> 58:29.299
Mr. Burke: So how do you get
a lucid experience

58:29.925 --> 58:32.511
that happens both
for people who have had

58:34.054 --> 58:35.472
hallucinogenic

58:35.597 --> 58:38.267
drugs potentially
in the hospital or,

58:38.392 --> 58:40.060
you know, anesthesia,

58:40.185 --> 58:41.186
But they're saying

58:41.311 --> 58:44.231
the same things as those
who have had no anesthesia

58:44.356 --> 58:46.984
and the same things
that little kids say,

58:47.109 --> 58:48.777
the same things that people
from different

58:48.902 --> 58:50.487
religious
backgrounds and cultures

58:50.612 --> 58:53.740
say you don't have mass
hallucinations.

59:01.164 --> 59:02.958
The moment
the truck struck me,

59:03.083 --> 59:06.044
I was standing
at the gates of Heaven.

59:11.842 --> 59:14.636
And it was magnificent.

59:14.761 --> 59:17.097
It was like the
inside of an oyster.

59:17.222 --> 59:20.809
It was pearl and dazzling,

59:21.059 --> 59:24.062
almost like it was living.

59:25.564 --> 59:27.858
It just looked that way
because of the light

59:27.983 --> 59:30.944
reflecting off the gate.

59:32.070 --> 59:33.655
Heaven is light.

59:33.780 --> 59:34.698
God is light.

59:34.823 --> 59:36.867
It's... it's astounding.

59:39.119 --> 59:40.537
One of the most
difficult things

59:40.662 --> 59:42.247
about talking about heaven

59:42.372 --> 59:44.791
is that you have to do it
with earthly words,

59:44.916 --> 59:48.545
and there are no earthly
words that do it justice.

59:55.719 --> 59:58.513
Mr. Black: I did think
for a moment, okay, I died.

59:58.638 --> 01:00:00.223
Okay, I'm gone.

01:00:00.349 --> 01:00:01.350
And was I sad?

01:00:01.475 --> 01:00:03.310
No, not at all.

01:00:06.355 --> 01:00:07.022
I wasn't worried

01:00:07.147 --> 01:00:08.523
about my mom or dad

01:00:08.648 --> 01:00:11.068
or what they would think
or my--, nothing.

01:00:11.193 --> 01:00:14.029
I was only looking forward
to where I was going

01:00:14.154 --> 01:00:17.616
and it was nothing but joy
and peace, love and unity.

01:00:25.457 --> 01:00:28.460
I was surrounded by people
I knew and loved in life.

01:00:30.087 --> 01:00:32.923
The first person
I saw was my grandfather.

01:00:33.048 --> 01:00:35.217
I was very close
to my grandfather.

01:00:35.342 --> 01:00:38.053
The last time I saw him,
he was in a casket.

01:00:38.178 --> 01:00:41.014
At his funeral, he did
not look good.

01:00:41.139 --> 01:00:44.101
Now I'm standing
at the gates of Heaven,

01:00:44.226 --> 01:00:46.144
and there he is
to greet me.

01:00:46.269 --> 01:00:47.562
And he looked really good.

01:00:47.687 --> 01:00:49.022
He extended his hands to me

01:00:49.147 --> 01:00:51.149
and spoke a language
I've never heard before,

01:00:51.274 --> 01:00:55.445
but fully understood and
said, Welcome home, Donnie.

01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:05.831
Mr. Black: I recognized this
group of people.

01:01:05.997 --> 01:01:11.586
These people are looking
at me with such love.

01:01:14.589 --> 01:01:18.260
They're all seemingly
at the prime of their life.

01:01:18.635 --> 01:01:19.636
And these people

01:01:19.761 --> 01:01:23.348
were greeting me
and they were so delighted

01:01:23.723 --> 01:01:26.726
that I was there,

01:01:27.352 --> 01:01:30.647
Dr. Neal: And I knew that they
were there for me,

01:01:30.772 --> 01:01:34.151
to welcome me,
to greet me, to to love me,

01:01:34.276 --> 01:01:36.278
to make me feel known.

01:01:36.945 --> 01:01:39.448
And I knew that
they had known loved me

01:01:39.573 --> 01:01:42.492
as long as I've existed.

01:01:46.246 --> 01:01:48.665
The music was phenomenal.

01:01:48.790 --> 01:01:51.793
Thousands of songs at the
same time without chaos,

01:01:52.461 --> 01:01:53.795
all manner of music,

01:01:54.129 --> 01:01:55.464
instrumental,

01:01:55.881 --> 01:01:57.632
choruses,

01:01:59.843 --> 01:02:03.180
Astoundingly,
they just invade you.

01:02:03.305 --> 01:02:06.266
I mean, you're permeated
by the music.

01:02:11.271 --> 01:02:14.983
My senses were
incredibly vivid,

01:02:15.108 --> 01:02:18.862
you know, touch and taste
and feel and hearing.

01:02:18.987 --> 01:02:20.113
It was just all.

01:02:20.238 --> 01:02:21.490
It's just the most
real thing

01:02:21.615 --> 01:02:22.991
that's ever happened to me.

01:02:25.494 --> 01:02:28.914
After I greeted
the people, they parted

01:02:29.039 --> 01:02:32.042
and I could see
through the gate.

01:02:32.876 --> 01:02:34.836
There was
a long boulevard that

01:02:34.961 --> 01:02:36.796
really bisects the city

01:02:36.922 --> 01:02:39.925
and it appears
to be constructed of gold.

01:02:40.467 --> 01:02:43.470
So many of the things
that we experience here

01:02:43.762 --> 01:02:46.515
are there,
but much infinitely

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:49.559
more glorious and perfect.

01:02:49.726 --> 01:02:52.145
I wanted to climb that hill

01:02:52.270 --> 01:02:54.397
and fall at the
feet of the great

01:02:54.523 --> 01:02:56.566
God of all
creation and say,

01:02:56.691 --> 01:02:59.402
"Thank you for
letting me come."

01:02:59.528 --> 01:03:00.820
That was my objective.

01:03:07.285 --> 01:03:09.913
Mr. Burke: Not every near-death
experience is a good one.

01:03:10.038 --> 01:03:13.375
23% of those who come
forward talking about them

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.003
talk about how they had
hellish experiences.

01:03:26.846 --> 01:03:27.639
At that time,

01:03:27.764 --> 01:03:30.684
I, I felt really empty.

01:03:30.809 --> 01:03:33.061
It just seemed like
the best thing to do

01:03:33.186 --> 01:03:35.063
was just to die
at that point.

01:03:35.188 --> 01:03:37.357
If I die,
then it's game over.

01:03:37.482 --> 01:03:39.901
And if I die, then the pain
and the suffering,

01:03:40.026 --> 01:03:41.403
the depression,

01:03:41.528 --> 01:03:43.947
the darkness,
all this is going to stop.

01:03:44.072 --> 01:03:46.157
Well,
if I do enough cocaine,

01:03:46.283 --> 01:03:47.909
then maybe my heart
will stop beating

01:03:48.034 --> 01:03:50.287
because it feels like it's
racing out of my chest.

01:03:57.711 --> 01:03:58.920
And I didn't see
a bright light.

01:03:59.045 --> 01:03:59.963
I saw a black tunnel.

01:04:00.088 --> 01:04:01.673
It felt like somebody
grabbed me and dropped me

01:04:01.798 --> 01:04:04.217
in this outer darkness.

01:04:04.342 --> 01:04:06.928
As I started racing down
this tunnel,

01:04:07.053 --> 01:04:08.430
it seemed like infinity.

01:04:08.555 --> 01:04:11.349
It was like
a bottomless pit.

01:04:11.474 --> 01:04:13.977
I don't know how,
but I was no longer high.

01:04:14.102 --> 01:04:17.105
All my senses
were at 1,000.

01:04:18.690 --> 01:04:20.442
I knew that I had died,

01:04:20.567 --> 01:04:22.068
and it was one of
the scariest moments

01:04:22.193 --> 01:04:24.154
in my entire life.

01:04:25.363 --> 01:04:27.324
And I'm racing
down this tunnel

01:04:27.449 --> 01:04:28.992
that seems like forever,

01:04:29.117 --> 01:04:31.620
like a thousand miles an hour

01:04:31.745 --> 01:04:33.663
as I'm just freefalling.

01:04:36.124 --> 01:04:38.335
If I'm going to hell,
there's got to be a mistake

01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:40.420
because I never
killed anybody.

01:04:40.545 --> 01:04:41.504
I didn't rob a bank.

01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:43.548
I mean, I'm a good person.

01:04:43.673 --> 01:04:44.674
I'm not a bad guy.

01:04:44.799 --> 01:04:47.010
The only person I hurt
was myself.

01:04:47.135 --> 01:04:50.221
When I began to justify
how good I was,

01:04:50.847 --> 01:04:52.474
it went faster

01:04:52.599 --> 01:04:54.601
like 2,000 miles an hour.

01:04:56.269 --> 01:04:58.146
It speeded up the process.

01:04:58.271 --> 01:05:01.232
Like, now you're
really going to Hell.

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:04.694
I remember at that point
I cried out

01:05:04.819 --> 01:05:07.781
with all desperation.

01:05:09.574 --> 01:05:13.244
I said, "God, you need to
come help me right now.

01:05:14.079 --> 01:05:17.082
because I need you.

01:05:17.916 --> 01:05:20.919
If you really exist,
I need your help.

01:05:21.461 --> 01:05:22.712
So you got to come help me.

01:05:22.837 --> 01:05:25.757
Please, God,
I need your help."

01:05:30.637 --> 01:05:31.388
Mr. Storm: In the bed

01:05:31.513 --> 01:05:34.432
that I had been in
was this big slab of meat.

01:05:34.641 --> 01:05:36.685
And when I looked
at the face,

01:05:36.810 --> 01:05:39.854
it bore an amazing
resemblance to me.

01:05:41.773 --> 01:05:44.526
And I could not understand

01:05:44.651 --> 01:05:47.070
how that could resemble me.

01:05:47.195 --> 01:05:49.280
But I was perfectly
well standing there,

01:05:49.406 --> 01:05:52.325
perfectly alive,
looking at this,

01:05:52.534 --> 01:05:53.451
hunk of meat.

01:05:54.953 --> 01:05:56.788
The other thing
that bothered me was that

01:05:56.913 --> 01:05:59.874
my wife would not
respond to me.

01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:03.628
Well, at first I started
talking in a nice voice,

01:06:03.753 --> 01:06:05.296
and then I started yelling
at her, like, you know,

01:06:06.631 --> 01:06:08.967
what the
hell is going on here?

01:06:09.092 --> 01:06:11.136
Look at me. Talk to me.

01:06:11.261 --> 01:06:12.178
You know,
I'm all better.

01:06:12.303 --> 01:06:14.848
You know, what's that
thing in the bed?

01:06:14.973 --> 01:06:16.516
How did it get there?

01:06:18.143 --> 01:06:21.146
I was very upset,
very distressed.

01:06:21.479 --> 01:06:24.315
And then I heard people out
in the hallway

01:06:24.441 --> 01:06:27.318
outside the well-lit room

01:06:28.111 --> 01:06:32.449
in the darkish-gray,
hazy hallway.

01:06:40.415 --> 01:06:42.292
And there was
a group of people standing

01:06:42.417 --> 01:06:46.004
outside the light
of the room in the hallway.

01:06:46.671 --> 01:06:47.547
I said, "I'm sick.

01:06:47.672 --> 01:06:49.215
I need a doctor."

01:06:50.717 --> 01:06:53.303
And they said, "We know.

01:06:53.428 --> 01:06:54.971
We know all about you.

01:06:55.096 --> 01:06:56.389
It's time for you to
come with us."

01:06:56.514 --> 01:06:59.058
So I thought that they were

01:06:59.184 --> 01:07:02.145
hospital personnel
to take me to a doctor.

01:07:05.398 --> 01:07:06.649
When I left the room

01:07:06.775 --> 01:07:08.026
and went into the hall,

01:07:09.444 --> 01:07:11.196
I can't explain how I knew,

01:07:11.321 --> 01:07:13.198
I couldn't go back
into the room.

01:07:13.323 --> 01:07:14.574
The door didn't close,

01:07:14.699 --> 01:07:16.242
but I knew that
it was impossible

01:07:16.367 --> 01:07:18.995
for me to go back
into the light of the room.

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:21.331
So I hesitated and
the people became very...

01:07:21.456 --> 01:07:23.374
Hurry up,
Let's go. Let's go.

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:25.210
We can't wait anymore.
You know.

01:07:25.335 --> 01:07:27.962
We've been here a long time
waiting for you.

01:07:28.087 --> 01:07:28.838
Hurry up.

01:07:28.963 --> 01:07:32.175
So I gave in
and went with them

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:34.469
and they immediately
surrounded me

01:07:34.594 --> 01:07:37.180
and moved me forward
into that greyness.

01:07:48.399 --> 01:07:52.570
As we moved along,
I could not perceive walls,

01:07:52.904 --> 01:07:56.324
ceiling, any
feature at all.

01:07:56.950 --> 01:07:58.743
And we walked
and walked and walked.

01:07:58.868 --> 01:08:00.537
And after a while
I was like, okay,

01:08:00.662 --> 01:08:02.705
this hospital's
not that big, you know?

01:08:02.831 --> 01:08:05.750
I mean, we walked miles
now, and it's like,

01:08:05.959 --> 01:08:07.627
where's the stairs?

01:08:07.752 --> 01:08:08.962
You know,
where's the up and down?

01:08:09.087 --> 01:08:11.130
Where's the walls?
And there was nothing.

01:08:11.256 --> 01:08:12.757
We just walked and walked.

01:08:15.593 --> 01:08:16.761
So I was asking the people

01:08:16.886 --> 01:08:18.763
around me like,
this isn't the hospital,

01:08:18.888 --> 01:08:21.266
This isn't right, you know,
where are we?

01:08:21.391 --> 01:08:22.100
Stuff like that, and,

01:08:22.225 --> 01:08:25.562
their response
was, "Shut up, be quiet.

01:08:25.854 --> 01:08:26.521
Keep moving.

01:08:26.646 --> 01:08:28.231
Move, move, move!"

01:08:30.650 --> 01:08:33.194
They'd say,
"You're going to find out.

01:08:33.319 --> 01:08:35.405
You'll find out.

01:08:35.530 --> 01:08:38.491
You're going to get there."

01:08:39.742 --> 01:08:41.494
There was a lot of
people around us,

01:08:41.619 --> 01:08:42.954
possibly hundreds,

01:08:43.079 --> 01:08:44.622
I don't know.
They were

01:08:44.747 --> 01:08:47.792
being very vulgar, very
threatening, very scary.

01:08:48.918 --> 01:08:50.753
I'm in abject darkness.

01:08:50.879 --> 01:08:53.256
I have absolutely no
idea which way

01:08:53.381 --> 01:08:55.633
is forward, backward.
I mean,

01:08:55.758 --> 01:08:57.802
all I knew was I wanted to
get away from them.

01:09:00.597 --> 01:09:03.266
They said, "No,
you've got further to go."

01:09:03.391 --> 01:09:06.311
And they started to push
and shove me.

01:09:07.145 --> 01:09:09.981
And I fought back.

01:09:10.106 --> 01:09:13.109
They began by punching,
shoving, kicking.

01:09:14.193 --> 01:09:17.697
And then they started
biting, scratching

01:09:18.907 --> 01:09:21.784
and tearing me apart, literally.

01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:24.120
disemboweling me,
gouging my eyes.

01:09:24.245 --> 01:09:25.788
And it was all accompanied

01:09:25.914 --> 01:09:27.582
with a great deal
of laughter and joy.

01:09:32.670 --> 01:09:35.048
I thought about

01:09:35.173 --> 01:09:36.841
my whole life
and everything seemed like

01:09:36.966 --> 01:09:38.843
what was the point.

01:09:38.968 --> 01:09:40.803
And I realized
that my relationships

01:09:40.929 --> 01:09:43.848
with my mother
and father were a disaster.

01:09:44.182 --> 01:09:47.185
My relationship with
my sisters wasn't good.

01:09:47.393 --> 01:09:50.647
My relationship with
my wife was very troubled.

01:09:52.857 --> 01:09:55.276
I was not proud or pleased

01:09:55.401 --> 01:09:57.612
with my relationship
with my two children.

01:09:59.906 --> 01:10:01.824
I sank into

01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:05.662
a pit of despair
and hopelessness

01:10:05.787 --> 01:10:08.039
that I can't begin
to describe.

01:10:12.418 --> 01:10:17.048
My mind offered up a memory
of myself as a little boy

01:10:17.173 --> 01:10:20.134
going to a Sunday school
singing "Jesus Loves Me"

01:10:21.010 --> 01:10:22.303
When I was a little boy

01:10:22.428 --> 01:10:24.514
and I was afraid,
like having nightmares

01:10:24.639 --> 01:10:27.684
at night or whatever,
I would pray to Him and

01:10:28.226 --> 01:10:30.186
He would chase the
lions and tigers.

01:10:30.311 --> 01:10:32.313
and bears away.

01:10:32.438 --> 01:10:34.983
And as a child,
it was, like, mostly

01:10:35.108 --> 01:10:37.026
in the image
of like a superhero.

01:10:37.151 --> 01:10:39.195
Jesus was like a superhero.

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:40.196
And so...

01:10:40.530 --> 01:10:41.239
that's it.

01:10:41.572 --> 01:10:43.074
That was all I knew.

01:10:43.199 --> 01:10:46.744
So I called out to him
in complete desperation,

01:10:47.996 --> 01:10:51.082
A tiny little star
appeared in the sky,

01:10:52.542 --> 01:10:54.627
and very rapidly
it got brighter

01:10:54.752 --> 01:10:57.672
and brighter and brighter.

01:10:58.297 --> 01:11:00.091
Mr. Black: I started moving

01:11:00.216 --> 01:11:03.428
helplessly
without direction.

01:11:03.553 --> 01:11:05.388
I had nothing to do
with this.

01:11:05.513 --> 01:11:07.348
I started moving
out of the room.

01:11:07.473 --> 01:11:09.684
I next realized that

01:11:09.809 --> 01:11:12.937
I have left the hospital
and now I'm traveling

01:11:13.646 --> 01:11:16.649
almost like a rocket ship,
just moving

01:11:16.899 --> 01:11:18.317
out of this atmosphere.

01:11:20.611 --> 01:11:23.614
As if in deep space.

01:11:24.991 --> 01:11:28.369
Mr. Storm: I realized we were
not on the ground anymore.

01:11:28.494 --> 01:11:31.456
We were moving upward,
straight upwards.

01:11:33.416 --> 01:11:35.501
So I've got my face
buried in His chest

01:11:35.626 --> 01:11:36.461
hanging on to Him.

01:11:36.586 --> 01:11:39.088
I'm like, I don't want to
let me go because I,

01:11:39.213 --> 01:11:40.590
I'm afraid if I let go,

01:11:40.715 --> 01:11:42.550
or if he lets go, I'm
going to fall back

01:11:42.675 --> 01:11:44.427
into that horrible
place again.

01:11:44.552 --> 01:11:47.346
Mr. Black: And there was a beam
of light that was lighting

01:11:47.472 --> 01:11:50.391
the pathway
of where I was going.

01:11:52.852 --> 01:11:54.520
My whole life
flashed in front of me

01:11:54.645 --> 01:11:56.147
as big as the sky,

01:11:57.023 --> 01:11:58.816
Mr. Black: Tiny spheres
of light.

01:11:59.484 --> 01:12:02.445
They weren't planets,
they weren't stars.

01:12:02.570 --> 01:12:05.573
These were beings
going to Earth

01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:08.034
Mr. Storm: Where we were going
is what I first thought

01:12:08.159 --> 01:12:11.579
was a galaxy.
A huge world of light.

01:12:11.954 --> 01:12:13.831
Mr. Black: The light that
I'm looking at,

01:12:13.956 --> 01:12:17.001
is coming from none
other than God Himself.

01:12:20.379 --> 01:12:23.382
Inside the light was life,

01:12:24.967 --> 01:12:27.970
And inside
that light was love.

01:12:28.096 --> 01:12:31.766
And my body is
still on Earth.

01:12:33.351 --> 01:12:36.813
My brain and eyeballs
are back there.

01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:39.816
But, I'm sensing
and discerning

01:12:39.941 --> 01:12:42.860
all of these things.

01:12:43.694 --> 01:12:45.029
When you leave this earth

01:12:45.154 --> 01:12:47.323
and you step into
the eternity,

01:12:47.448 --> 01:12:50.451
everything is
crystal clear.

01:12:58.042 --> 01:13:00.128
Mr. Black: I knew I was coming
to this holy area

01:13:00.253 --> 01:13:01.712
and obviously

01:13:01.838 --> 01:13:04.757
it took another second
to connect the dots.

01:13:04.882 --> 01:13:06.300
This is Heaven.

01:13:11.722 --> 01:13:12.640
Mr. Storm: And he spoke to me

01:13:12.765 --> 01:13:15.685
for the first time
in his voice,

01:13:15.810 --> 01:13:17.937
but it was telepathic
but it wasn't

01:13:18.062 --> 01:13:19.105
a thought of mine.

01:13:19.230 --> 01:13:21.357
It was his voice
in my head.

01:13:21.482 --> 01:13:23.025
And then he said,
I've got some people

01:13:23.151 --> 01:13:24.402
that I want you to meet.

01:13:24.527 --> 01:13:26.195
They've recorded your life

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:29.282
and they want
show you your life.

01:13:29.824 --> 01:13:31.701
So they proceeded to

01:13:31.826 --> 01:13:33.995
show me my life
in chronological order.

01:13:38.791 --> 01:13:41.794
What I saw, to
summarize it, was

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:44.755
happy youth

01:13:44.881 --> 01:13:45.798
pretty much

01:13:45.923 --> 01:13:49.260
going to adolescence,
everything going sour,

01:13:50.428 --> 01:13:51.679
particularly
with my relationship

01:13:51.804 --> 01:13:52.513
with my father.

01:13:52.638 --> 01:13:56.851
Because of my father's
cruelty to me,

01:13:58.060 --> 01:13:59.729
I was cruel back.

01:14:01.606 --> 01:14:04.525
My father was physically
and emotionally abusive

01:14:04.650 --> 01:14:07.904
every day to my mother,
my sisters and to me.

01:14:09.947 --> 01:14:11.157
I mean, it never stopped.

01:14:13.451 --> 01:14:14.994
The only way
that I could deal with it

01:14:15.119 --> 01:14:17.997
was to try
and not feel anything.

01:14:18.372 --> 01:14:20.208
And all he wanted for me

01:14:20.333 --> 01:14:23.461
was to be
a little duplicate of him,

01:14:23.794 --> 01:14:26.672
you know,
just be subservient to him.

01:14:26.797 --> 01:14:29.425
You know,
being being disobedient

01:14:29.550 --> 01:14:31.886
had immediate
physical consequences

01:14:32.011 --> 01:14:34.972
of being kicked
or punched or hit.

01:14:36.224 --> 01:14:38.976
And I saw myself striving

01:14:39.101 --> 01:14:42.396
to become emotionless
and feeling-less,

01:14:43.272 --> 01:14:45.316
which was a way for
me to protect myself

01:14:45.441 --> 01:14:46.400
from being hurt.

01:14:48.402 --> 01:14:51.239
As I became
more manipulative

01:14:51.364 --> 01:14:53.241
and successful,

01:14:53.366 --> 01:14:56.494
the more the angels
and Jesus expressed

01:14:56.619 --> 01:14:57.828
their disappointment

01:14:57.954 --> 01:15:00.957
and sadness
with me and my life.

01:15:02.625 --> 01:15:04.961
And it really hurt
to disappoint them

01:15:05.086 --> 01:15:05.920
because I here

01:15:06.045 --> 01:15:09.006
I have these newfound
friends, my big rescuer,

01:15:10.007 --> 01:15:13.010
you know, best friend
I ever had.

01:15:14.845 --> 01:15:16.597
And I'm-- and I'm
looking at my life

01:15:16.722 --> 01:15:19.642
and I'm a big, huge
disappointment.

01:15:22.645 --> 01:15:25.815
and you should put me back.

01:15:26.941 --> 01:15:29.443
I don't belong here.

01:15:33.823 --> 01:15:34.949
You know,
you've made a mistake.

01:15:35.074 --> 01:15:36.033
I don't belong here.

01:15:36.158 --> 01:15:38.119
And he said,
"We don't make mistakes.

01:15:38.244 --> 01:15:41.122
You do belong here."

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:46.961
Dr. Neal: At this point.

01:15:47.086 --> 01:15:48.838
I had had

01:15:48.963 --> 01:15:50.923
a number of operations and

01:15:51.048 --> 01:15:55.428
I was finally able
to be upright instead of

01:15:56.012 --> 01:15:56.971
wheelchair bound.

01:15:58.514 --> 01:16:00.182
But I,

01:16:00.308 --> 01:16:03.311
wasn't
able to walk very well.

01:16:05.604 --> 01:16:08.607
When I was
sent back to my body,

01:16:09.608 --> 01:16:12.778
I knew that
sharing my experiences

01:16:12.903 --> 01:16:15.823
with other people
was part of the deal.

01:16:16.699 --> 01:16:20.661
I knew that part of that
was writing about them.

01:16:21.579 --> 01:16:23.956
And so I woke up

01:16:24.081 --> 01:16:27.793
and I spent the
next week or so

01:16:28.419 --> 01:16:31.839
getting up at three
or four in the morning and

01:16:32.465 --> 01:16:35.468
writing for a few hours
before the morning routine.

01:16:36.677 --> 01:16:40.598
And so I, you know,
made my final revisions.

01:16:40.723 --> 01:16:43.934
And when I hit
the save button,

01:16:44.185 --> 01:16:47.855
I took my youngest son, who
was still living at home

01:16:48.522 --> 01:16:51.525
into town to get ice cream
so we could celebrate.

01:16:52.193 --> 01:16:55.196
And so as we were
driving into town

01:16:56.530 --> 01:17:00.201
to celebrate,
I called my older boys

01:17:01.035 --> 01:17:04.038
because my oldest son
and his brother

01:17:04.413 --> 01:17:06.999
were at the time
living in Maine.

01:17:07.124 --> 01:17:08.250
They were ski training.

01:17:10.378 --> 01:17:11.796
And I called them

01:17:11.921 --> 01:17:14.882
to share this great news.

01:17:16.008 --> 01:17:18.636
And the coach
answered the phone

01:17:18.761 --> 01:17:22.556
and told me that Willie
had just been hit

01:17:22.681 --> 01:17:24.642
by a car and killed.

01:17:32.691 --> 01:17:33.901
and um,

01:17:40.699 --> 01:17:42.034
I mean,

01:17:43.411 --> 01:17:45.621
I reacted

01:17:45.746 --> 01:17:48.707
like any mother would.

01:17:57.049 --> 01:18:00.761
The depth of my spiritual
knowledge,

01:18:02.096 --> 01:18:05.266
does not protect me
from grief.

01:18:06.517 --> 01:18:09.520
It doesn't protect me from

01:18:09.645 --> 01:18:12.606
sorrow or any of
those things.

01:18:14.316 --> 01:18:15.443
The depth of pain,

01:18:15.568 --> 01:18:18.529
of losing a child is,

01:18:19.238 --> 01:18:22.032
I don't think, a

01:18:22.158 --> 01:18:24.243
pain that can be
replicated by

01:18:24.368 --> 01:18:27.288
any other human
experience.

01:18:28.831 --> 01:18:31.834
I mean, I was devastated

01:18:48.684 --> 01:18:51.687
And it all stopped

01:18:52.813 --> 01:18:55.816
just as quickly I arrived.

01:19:02.114 --> 01:19:04.867
That accident happened
at 11:45 in the morning.

01:19:04.992 --> 01:19:07.995
I arrived at Hermann
Memorial Hospital

01:19:08.245 --> 01:19:11.248
at like 6:15 that night.

01:19:11.665 --> 01:19:14.543
So they went and got my
wife out of her classroom,

01:19:14.668 --> 01:19:15.503
brought it down
to the office

01:19:15.628 --> 01:19:17.129
and told her the news.

01:19:17.796 --> 01:19:20.257
And I walked down the
hall and into the office,

01:19:20.382 --> 01:19:21.926
and our assistant principal

01:19:22.051 --> 01:19:23.469
came out
from around her desk

01:19:23.594 --> 01:19:25.179
and just wrapped me
in this hug.

01:19:25.304 --> 01:19:28.182
And she says, "Don's
been in an accident."

01:19:28.307 --> 01:19:30.309
And that's all that
we knew.

01:19:30.434 --> 01:19:33.437
I was taken into surgery
that evening

01:19:33.687 --> 01:19:36.690
and was in surgery
for 12 hours.

01:19:38.484 --> 01:19:39.985
The next day

01:19:40.110 --> 01:19:43.030
was when I realized
I was in the recovery room.

01:19:43.739 --> 01:19:46.742
The emergency room
had called

01:19:46.867 --> 01:19:49.119
and the nurse said,
he can't hold the phone,

01:19:49.245 --> 01:19:51.038
but I'm going to put it
next to his ear

01:19:51.163 --> 01:19:52.790
so he can hear you.

01:19:54.041 --> 01:19:55.084
And I started with
the questions,

01:19:55.209 --> 01:19:57.044
"Are you okay?
What happened?

01:19:57.169 --> 01:19:58.212
Do I need to
come out there?"

01:19:58.337 --> 01:20:01.215
just, you know, rambling
sort of things.

01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:02.925
And all I could hear
him say was,

01:20:03.050 --> 01:20:04.802
"I just want to go home.

01:20:04.927 --> 01:20:06.053
I just want to go home."

01:20:08.472 --> 01:20:09.682
Later, I understood

01:20:09.807 --> 01:20:12.726
that he meant his
Heavenly home.

01:20:13.727 --> 01:20:14.520
Had I had a choice,

01:20:14.645 --> 01:20:16.230
I would not have
come back here.

01:20:16.355 --> 01:20:19.400
I mean, I've had 30
wonderful years here,

01:20:20.025 --> 01:20:21.819
but I would still rather
be there.

01:20:21.944 --> 01:20:23.070
I know what happens next,

01:20:23.195 --> 01:20:25.447
and it's it's always
better there

01:20:25.573 --> 01:20:26.824
than it will ever be here.

01:20:26.949 --> 01:20:29.910
So I didn't really want to
come back, but

01:20:30.327 --> 01:20:32.329
I didn't get a choice.

01:20:34.290 --> 01:20:36.542
He went into a deep
depression.

01:20:36.667 --> 01:20:40.588
And I would go in, and
he would just lay there.

01:20:40.879 --> 01:20:44.133
He wouldn't talk to me.
He wouldn't acknowledge me.

01:20:44.925 --> 01:20:46.176
I would bring papers
to grade.

01:20:46.302 --> 01:20:47.970
I would sit over in the
corner and grade

01:20:48.095 --> 01:20:50.180
and stay there
till about 11:00

01:20:50.306 --> 01:20:52.099
almost every night.

01:20:52.850 --> 01:20:54.184
And then I'd tell him
goodnight,

01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:55.561
and I'd leave.

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:02.443
And it was hurtful, because
I thought, you're alive.

01:21:02.860 --> 01:21:04.445
You know, you're alive.
You're back with us.

01:21:04.570 --> 01:21:05.529
Don't you love us enough to

01:21:05.654 --> 01:21:06.947
be glad to be back with us?

01:21:09.158 --> 01:21:12.244
And to me, that
was harder to deal with.

01:21:12.369 --> 01:21:14.246
The depression was harder
to deal with

01:21:14.371 --> 01:21:17.374
than the physical injuries,
which were massive.

01:21:17.916 --> 01:21:20.085
And I remember one night,

01:21:20.210 --> 01:21:21.670
I thought, you know what?

01:21:21.795 --> 01:21:23.255
I'm going to go home
early tonight,

01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:25.257
and I'm going to take
a warm shower,

01:21:25.382 --> 01:21:26.800
and I'm going to
crawl in the bed,

01:21:26.925 --> 01:21:28.552
and get a good
night's sleep.

01:21:28.677 --> 01:21:31.639
So I gathered up
all my stuff,

01:21:31.764 --> 01:21:33.140
and I just said,

01:21:33.265 --> 01:21:35.351
well, I guess I'll
see you tomorrow.

01:21:40.648 --> 01:21:43.442
No response.

01:21:43.567 --> 01:21:44.735
That night, something

01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:47.738
clicked inside of me,
and I had had it.

01:21:47.946 --> 01:21:50.908
And I dropped
that book bag,

01:21:51.033 --> 01:21:53.619
and I stomped my way over
to the side of the bed,

01:21:53.744 --> 01:21:54.995
and I let him have it.

01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:56.830
What is wrong with you?

01:21:56.955 --> 01:21:58.457
Why aren't
you glad to see us?

01:21:58.582 --> 01:22:00.376
Why aren't you glad
that you're back with us?

01:22:00.501 --> 01:22:02.294
It was just--
it just tumbled out.

01:22:04.755 --> 01:22:05.964
And so I grabbed
my stuff up,

01:22:06.090 --> 01:22:08.175
and I'm walking
out the door.

01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:11.220
And there was a big mirror
next to his bed.

01:22:12.888 --> 01:22:15.891
And I looked over there,
and he was crying.

01:22:17.601 --> 01:22:19.186
Just tears.

01:22:20.062 --> 01:22:23.732
So I walked myself back
over, and I kind of had to-

01:22:23.941 --> 01:22:26.944
he had so many metal
things that we had kind of

01:22:27.236 --> 01:22:30.239
got my way in and I just
wrapped him in my arms.

01:22:30.781 --> 01:22:33.575
And I said, It's
going to be okay.

01:22:33.701 --> 01:22:37.913
And I realized then that

01:22:39.206 --> 01:22:42.167
I had to accept that
sometimes

01:22:42.459 --> 01:22:45.421
he was going through things
I didn't understand.

01:22:54.513 --> 01:22:56.640
Mr. Storm: Finally,

01:22:56.765 --> 01:22:59.476
I got through it.

01:22:59.601 --> 01:23:01.437
Jesus said,
"Do you have any questions?"

01:23:01.562 --> 01:23:03.063
I said, "I've got a million
questions."

01:23:03.188 --> 01:23:05.190
He said,
"What do you want to know?"

01:23:05.315 --> 01:23:06.275
So I asked him
everything that

01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:08.235
I could think of to know,

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:09.903
And if we went
through that,

01:23:10.028 --> 01:23:11.321
it would
take us several years.

01:23:12.781 --> 01:23:14.366
And He gave me a whole

01:23:14.491 --> 01:23:16.994
new understanding
of everything.

01:23:17.119 --> 01:23:18.495
I said, "Great,

01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:20.330
Now that I understand,
I want to go to heaven."

01:23:20.456 --> 01:23:21.874
He said, "um um,

01:23:22.958 --> 01:23:24.752
You're not ready
for Heaven yet."

01:23:26.462 --> 01:23:28.464
Finally, I said, "What do
you want me to do?"

01:23:28.589 --> 01:23:29.715
"I want you to love
the person

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:30.591
that you're with."

01:23:30.758 --> 01:23:32.301
I said, "Okay, yeah,
but then what

01:23:32.426 --> 01:23:33.552
do you want me to do
after I do that?"

01:23:33.677 --> 01:23:35.429
And He said, "No, that's
what I want you to do."

01:23:35.554 --> 01:23:38.557
I said, you know, "What
good is that going to do?"

01:23:38.682 --> 01:23:40.851
He said, "It's going to
change the world."

01:23:41.685 --> 01:23:44.688
And I said, "That's
going to change the world?

01:23:45.272 --> 01:23:47.357
I don't think so, no."

01:23:47.483 --> 01:23:48.442
I said,
"You don't understand.

01:23:48.567 --> 01:23:51.028
The world is like
a terrible, cruel place.

01:23:51.153 --> 01:23:52.696
Even if I love someone,
they're just going to go

01:23:52.821 --> 01:23:55.574
get beat up somewhere else
and not going to--"

01:23:55.699 --> 01:23:57.242
He said, "No, if you
love someone,

01:23:57.367 --> 01:23:59.203
they'll take that love
out into the world

01:23:59.328 --> 01:24:01.872
and maybe they'll love
somebody and it'll

01:24:01.997 --> 01:24:02.956
grow and grow and grow."

01:24:03.081 --> 01:24:04.583
I said, "It's not going to
work."

01:24:04.708 --> 01:24:05.626
And He said,
"It's God's plan.

01:24:05.751 --> 01:24:07.211
It's going to work."

01:24:07.336 --> 01:24:09.755
Well, when he pulls out
the God's plan work,

01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:10.547
you know,

01:24:10.672 --> 01:24:12.007
I mean, like,
what can you say?

01:24:15.719 --> 01:24:18.722
And so finally I conceded.

01:24:18.847 --> 01:24:20.224
and I said, "Okay,
I'll go back."

01:24:20.349 --> 01:24:21.600
And with that, bang,

01:24:21.725 --> 01:24:23.644
I'm in the body,
I'm in the bed.

01:24:29.316 --> 01:24:30.484
The nurse who'd
been in the room

01:24:30.609 --> 01:24:31.944
comes in and says,

01:24:32.069 --> 01:24:33.737
a doctor has arrived
at the hospital and

01:24:33.862 --> 01:24:36.573
we're going to prepare you
for surgery.

01:24:36.698 --> 01:24:38.242
When I awoke,

01:24:38.367 --> 01:24:40.494
I knew that
what had happened to me

01:24:40.619 --> 01:24:43.622
was the most
important thing in my life.

01:24:45.123 --> 01:24:48.794
Because now my life had
real meaning and purpose.

01:24:50.212 --> 01:24:51.380
I was very, very weak.

01:24:51.505 --> 01:24:54.424
I had been in
surgery for hours.

01:24:55.968 --> 01:24:57.594
I'd spent
most of the morning

01:24:57.719 --> 01:24:58.929
trying to think of how
I was going

01:24:59.054 --> 01:25:02.015
to tell my wife
what had happened.

01:25:02.808 --> 01:25:05.769
I said to her,
"It's all love."

01:25:07.187 --> 01:25:09.064
She said, "I love you."

01:25:09.189 --> 01:25:11.692
And I said, "I know you
love me, but it's all love."

01:25:14.361 --> 01:25:17.364
She said, "What are you
talking about?"

01:25:17.531 --> 01:25:20.534
And I said, "It's
an ocean of love.

01:25:21.827 --> 01:25:24.788
And you have to just go in

01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:28.083
into that ocean of love
and be a part of it."

01:25:30.210 --> 01:25:33.213
And she said, "Okay, honey,

01:25:35.090 --> 01:25:37.426
Try to get some rest."

01:25:41.889 --> 01:25:43.015
Here I am. I'm I' giv--

01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:46.059
I'm giving her
the abbreviated

01:25:46.602 --> 01:25:49.605
wisdom of God.

01:25:50.814 --> 01:25:52.774
And she's basically
telling me,

01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:54.318
you know,
you're making no sense.

01:25:54.443 --> 01:25:55.903
It's crazy talk.

01:25:58.697 --> 01:25:59.907
From that day forward,

01:26:00.032 --> 01:26:03.577
I tried to tell people
about God, Heaven, Hell,

01:26:04.953 --> 01:26:07.956
what I'd experienced,
and nobody,

01:26:08.415 --> 01:26:11.418
nobody took me
seriously at all.

01:26:11.752 --> 01:26:13.378
I was a zealot.

01:26:13.503 --> 01:26:14.796
I was a complete zealot.

01:26:14.922 --> 01:26:17.841
And it was

01:26:18.425 --> 01:26:19.968
not good
for my relationship

01:26:20.093 --> 01:26:23.013
with my kids
because the more that they

01:26:23.972 --> 01:26:26.975
did not respect what
I was trying to tell them

01:26:27.392 --> 01:26:30.187
and the more they told me
I was nuts and crazy

01:26:30.312 --> 01:26:31.355
and stuff like that,
the more...

01:26:32.689 --> 01:26:34.483
it totally alienated them

01:26:34.608 --> 01:26:37.152
from the Bible,
from God, from me.

01:26:37.277 --> 01:26:40.280
I mean, it was completely
counterproductive.

01:26:41.281 --> 01:26:42.908
It was a disaster.

01:26:50.415 --> 01:26:51.875
My wife left me.

01:26:53.126 --> 01:26:56.505
She poisoned the
kids against me.

01:26:59.007 --> 01:27:00.092
They've rejected me.

01:27:00.217 --> 01:27:01.218
They don't want anything
to do with me.

01:27:01.343 --> 01:27:04.304
They think I'm a crazy man.

01:27:05.389 --> 01:27:08.392
It's all going to work out.

01:27:12.729 --> 01:27:14.064
I know that God works
stuff out.

01:27:14.189 --> 01:27:17.150
It just doesn't happen
on our time frame.

01:27:17.609 --> 01:27:19.069
I mean, I'd like it now.

01:27:19.194 --> 01:27:20.946
It's not happening
right now,

01:27:21.071 --> 01:27:22.030
but it could happen
tomorrow.

01:27:22.155 --> 01:27:24.950
It might take a long time.

01:27:25.075 --> 01:27:26.493
I don't know,

01:27:31.456 --> 01:27:32.541
A couple of years
down the road

01:27:32.666 --> 01:27:33.291
when I found out

01:27:33.417 --> 01:27:34.918
about the Heaven
experience,

01:27:35.043 --> 01:27:35.919
people have asked me,

01:27:36.044 --> 01:27:38.588
"Aren't you mad that
he didn't tell you?"

01:27:38.714 --> 01:27:40.340
Not really.

01:27:40.465 --> 01:27:44.094
I was relieved
because now I understand.

01:27:45.554 --> 01:27:46.722
You know,
if you've been to Heaven,

01:27:46.847 --> 01:27:49.182
why would you want to be
back in the pain

01:27:49.307 --> 01:27:50.684
that he was in?

01:27:54.062 --> 01:27:56.481
I found myself
on a daily basis

01:27:56.606 --> 01:27:59.359
with all these devices
attached to me

01:27:59.484 --> 01:28:02.195
and unable to move at all.

01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:04.031
I couldn't do a
single solitary thing

01:28:04.156 --> 01:28:05.073
for myself at all.

01:28:05.198 --> 01:28:07.659
38 and then 39 year old man

01:28:07.784 --> 01:28:10.746
who was completely
helpless.

01:28:16.543 --> 01:28:17.419
Why?

01:28:18.170 --> 01:28:19.629
You let me see that,

01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:21.506
And you brought
me back to this.

01:28:22.174 --> 01:28:24.009
What is going on here?

01:28:24.217 --> 01:28:27.220
What was the purpose
of this?

01:28:35.896 --> 01:28:37.481
Dr. Moody: In my studies
of psychiatry,

01:28:37.606 --> 01:28:39.775
I quickly realized
that practically

01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:42.819
everybody
is chasing something.

01:28:43.612 --> 01:28:46.823
Some chase fame
or money or power.

01:28:47.741 --> 01:28:50.702
But what I quickly realized
in talking with people

01:28:50.827 --> 01:28:52.412
who had near-death
experiences

01:28:52.537 --> 01:28:54.664
is that whatever
they were chasing

01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:57.751
before this experience,
convinced them that

01:28:58.043 --> 01:29:00.796
what life is all
about is learning to love.

01:29:04.549 --> 01:29:07.511
Mr. Burke: And they all come
back all around the globe

01:29:07.719 --> 01:29:11.181
with the same "aha".
That God is love.

01:29:11.598 --> 01:29:13.517
And that how we treat and
love one another

01:29:13.642 --> 01:29:16.019
is what matters
most to God.

01:29:16.144 --> 01:29:16.853
You have people

01:29:16.978 --> 01:29:19.439
who have these experiences
and come back

01:29:19.564 --> 01:29:22.526
and their life
is radically changed.

01:29:24.861 --> 01:29:25.695
Mr. Storm: When I came back

01:29:25.821 --> 01:29:26.988
one of the things I knew
I wanted

01:29:27.114 --> 01:29:30.033
to make friends
with my dad.

01:29:31.034 --> 01:29:33.703
Not only was
I able to forgive my father

01:29:33.829 --> 01:29:36.665
because I understood
that he was just messed up

01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:39.209
because of his messed up
childhood.

01:29:39.334 --> 01:29:40.669
All my father
really wanted to do

01:29:40.794 --> 01:29:42.212
was to be loved but he

01:29:42.337 --> 01:29:44.339
didn't know how to do that
in an appropriate way.

01:29:44.464 --> 01:29:46.842
So he tried to be loved
in inappropriate ways.

01:29:46.967 --> 01:29:49.886
He thought obedience
and discipline.

01:29:50.679 --> 01:29:52.097
And my mother
and my sisters

01:29:52.222 --> 01:29:53.265
were really angry with me

01:29:53.390 --> 01:29:56.309
because they all told me
several times

01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:58.979
"You and Dad
hated each other

01:29:59.104 --> 01:30:02.023
and now you're
his best friend. Why?"

01:30:03.775 --> 01:30:05.777
And I'd say, "Because
he's my dad."

01:30:07.404 --> 01:30:09.197
Grace is passed along
and passed along

01:30:09.322 --> 01:30:11.867
and passed along.
And it's powerful.

01:30:11.992 --> 01:30:13.994
It's powerful because
people change lives

01:30:14.119 --> 01:30:15.245
for the good.

01:30:15.370 --> 01:30:19.332
They find hope, peace,
love, joy, contentment.

01:30:19.457 --> 01:30:21.918
You know.

01:30:22.043 --> 01:30:23.753
And they also find

01:30:23.879 --> 01:30:25.755
God and eternal life.

01:30:33.180 --> 01:30:35.599
Dr. Neal: When I was being shown

01:30:35.724 --> 01:30:37.601
the ripple effect
of my own actions

01:30:37.726 --> 01:30:41.188
and my own words,
I was able to see this

01:30:41.688 --> 01:30:45.859
20, 25, 35 times
removed from me.

01:30:47.110 --> 01:30:48.486
That's

01:30:48.612 --> 01:30:51.615
a big distance.

01:30:51.865 --> 01:30:54.868
I understood all the hurts
and sorrows and dreams.

01:30:55.202 --> 01:30:58.830
Everything that had brought
me to that point in time

01:30:59.247 --> 01:31:02.250
when I may have hurt
someone else.

01:31:02.375 --> 01:31:05.295
I also had this complete
understanding

01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:06.755
of the back story

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:08.340
or the, you know,
the life story

01:31:08.465 --> 01:31:10.508
of the other
people involved

01:31:11.051 --> 01:31:13.470
and everything
that had brought them

01:31:13.595 --> 01:31:16.431
to that moment in time
where they hurt me

01:31:16.556 --> 01:31:17.807
or they
hurt someone I loved

01:31:19.643 --> 01:31:21.353
What we
each say and what we

01:31:21.478 --> 01:31:24.522
each do and the choices
we make matter.

01:31:25.690 --> 01:31:26.900
They really do.

01:31:33.823 --> 01:31:36.826
Dr. Neal: When I talk
about my son's death,

01:31:37.077 --> 01:31:38.870
I know that he went home,

01:31:38.995 --> 01:31:41.790
and I'm sure that he didn't
want to come back either.

01:31:41.915 --> 01:31:44.834
I'm sure he was reassured
that we would be fine.

01:31:46.670 --> 01:31:48.546
When my time
on earth is done,

01:31:48.672 --> 01:31:51.258
my oldest son
will be there to greet me,

01:31:51.383 --> 01:31:54.386
my father, my stepfather.

01:31:54.928 --> 01:31:55.762
I now know

01:31:55.887 --> 01:31:58.431
other people who have died,
people who I love, people

01:31:58.556 --> 01:31:59.891
who are important
in my life.

01:32:00.016 --> 01:32:01.309
I don't see

01:32:01.434 --> 01:32:04.479
us here on Earth, and God's
world is over here.

01:32:04.938 --> 01:32:08.233
I think we exist
in the midst of it.

01:32:11.403 --> 01:32:13.363
I had the most

01:32:13.488 --> 01:32:16.408
overwhelming sense
of being home,

01:32:17.075 --> 01:32:18.785
of being where
I really belong,

01:32:18.910 --> 01:32:21.454
where we
really belong, all of us.

01:32:23.206 --> 01:32:25.875
It took about a few
months to recover fully.

01:32:26.042 --> 01:32:28.211
I was still feeling
the pain,

01:32:28.336 --> 01:32:31.339
feeling a little down,
depressed. Seeing Hell

01:32:31.464 --> 01:32:35.593
and Heaven, changed me to
kind of prioritize others.

01:32:36.386 --> 01:32:39.431
So at the age of 35,
I joined the Army Reserves.

01:32:40.265 --> 01:32:42.309
I became a chaplain.

01:32:42.434 --> 01:32:43.727
People just
came back from war

01:32:43.852 --> 01:32:44.936
and you could tell
that they had

01:32:45.061 --> 01:32:47.355
a very heartbroken
experience

01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:50.191
or a psychological damage,
or the atrocities of war.

01:32:50.317 --> 01:32:52.485
So we did a lot
of counseling.

01:32:52.610 --> 01:32:54.154
We would pick up
phone calls at two,

01:32:54.279 --> 01:32:55.280
three in the morning,

01:32:55.405 --> 01:32:57.657
go with them to training,
hang out with them.

01:32:57.782 --> 01:33:00.535
I would tell them that
there's hope.

01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:03.621
I would tell them that
depression is not forever.

01:33:05.373 --> 01:33:07.375
I believe
all over the world,

01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:08.793
there are so many unique

01:33:08.918 --> 01:33:10.879
NDEs, near-death
experiences,

01:33:11.004 --> 01:33:12.005
and so many cultures

01:33:12.130 --> 01:33:14.132
and backgrounds, American
or not,

01:33:14.257 --> 01:33:16.885
all types of religions,
because

01:33:17.010 --> 01:33:18.553
death is as real as life.

01:33:19.637 --> 01:33:21.306
And I believe God
in his mercy,

01:33:21.431 --> 01:33:22.807
no matter what
religious background

01:33:22.932 --> 01:33:24.934
you are, allows you
to go through that

01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:28.063
so that you can seek Him
in the process.

01:33:28.813 --> 01:33:31.316
I don't know why
some people survive

01:33:31.441 --> 01:33:33.234
and some people don't.

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:34.611
I wish.

01:33:34.736 --> 01:33:36.529
I wouldn't have survived.

01:33:36.654 --> 01:33:37.655
I've had some
very real things

01:33:37.781 --> 01:33:38.615
happen to me on Earth.

01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:40.909
The birth
of five grandchildren,

01:33:41.034 --> 01:33:42.702
seeing my children
all graduate.

01:33:42.827 --> 01:33:45.747
I mean, it's
been glorious in many ways,

01:33:46.081 --> 01:33:47.582
but nothing compares
to Heaven.

01:33:47.707 --> 01:33:49.376
It's just, that's
the most real thing.

01:33:49.501 --> 01:33:51.419
That is my reality.

01:33:51.544 --> 01:33:53.254
This is not.

01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:54.047
Mr. Burke: What do we have

01:33:54.172 --> 01:33:57.092
more in common
as humanity than death?

01:33:57.342 --> 01:34:01.012
And to know that there is
hope beyond this life,

01:34:01.805 --> 01:34:04.099
that there truly is beauty,

01:34:04.224 --> 01:34:07.018
and relationship and love

01:34:07.143 --> 01:34:09.813
and adventure ahead.

01:34:09.938 --> 01:34:11.314
You know, that

01:34:11.439 --> 01:34:14.192
all of our our history
and our memories,

01:34:14.317 --> 01:34:17.028
they don't end and we don't
become something else.

01:34:17.153 --> 01:34:18.071
It goes on.

01:34:21.658 --> 01:34:23.284
Dr. Sabom: People ought to
keep an open mind

01:34:23.410 --> 01:34:25.120
to what's going on,

01:34:25.245 --> 01:34:27.997
not accept everything
they hear

01:34:28.832 --> 01:34:31.876
from people, from me,
from anybody.

01:34:32.710 --> 01:34:35.713
Be skeptical,
ask questions,

01:34:36.798 --> 01:34:38.550
think about it.

01:34:38.675 --> 01:34:41.719
There are things that we
can't explain, and I think

01:34:42.011 --> 01:34:45.223
it needs to be documented
as much as we can.

01:34:45.515 --> 01:34:49.060
Documentation's important.
Without that,

01:34:49.727 --> 01:34:52.730
it's an interesting story,
and that's it.

01:34:55.066 --> 01:34:56.568
We can only do so much.

01:34:56.693 --> 01:34:58.153
You know,
we're human beings

01:34:58.278 --> 01:34:59.821
and we do the best we can.

01:34:59.946 --> 01:35:01.698
I think
most people really do.

01:35:01.823 --> 01:35:03.783
We don't have
all the answers,

01:35:03.908 --> 01:35:06.870
and I don't think we ever
will have all the answers.

01:35:06.995 --> 01:35:09.247
In the scientific realm.

01:35:09.372 --> 01:35:11.875
What is a human
soul? Is a human soul?

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.877
does it live after death?

01:35:14.002 --> 01:35:15.211
I don't think science
is going

01:35:15.336 --> 01:35:16.713
to answer those questions.

01:35:16.838 --> 01:35:19.924
I think all of these
near-death experiences

01:35:21.384 --> 01:35:24.637
suggest that
that's possible.
