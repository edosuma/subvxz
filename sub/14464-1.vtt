WEBVTT

01:41.227 --> 01:42.562
- Take it easy, Peter.

01:44.064 --> 01:46.066
Not the kinda research you expected, huh?

01:47.525 --> 01:48.610
Relax!

01:48.818 --> 01:50.570
Sit back and enjoy the ride.

01:59.204 --> 01:59.996
- Kill it!

02:02.040 --> 02:05.376
Go, go, go, go!

02:05.585 --> 02:06.586
Keep firing!

02:13.593 --> 02:15.303
He's been tracking us!

02:19.516 --> 02:21.810
I nailed the bastard!

02:27.690 --> 02:28.691
My arm!

02:42.914 --> 02:43.998
- So what do you think?

02:46.793 --> 02:48.461
Glad you came, right?

02:48.670 --> 02:50.296
Said you wanted to be rich,

02:50.505 --> 02:52.048
well, this is what it looks like.

02:54.342 --> 02:56.010
Glad you made yourself comfortable.

03:20.326 --> 03:22.120
- God help us.

05:23.700 --> 05:24.409
- So what you're stating

05:24.617 --> 05:26.536
is that Wexel Hall Pharmaceuticals

05:26.744 --> 05:29.247
have denied any knowledge of
genetic testing on animals

05:29.455 --> 05:31.457
at their secret labs in Eastern Europe?

05:31.666 --> 05:34.002
- Well, actually, the
fact that CEO J.D. Murdoch

05:34.210 --> 05:36.921
personally contacted PETA
to deny these claims,

05:37.130 --> 05:39.257
we feel gave total credence to the leak

05:39.465 --> 05:42.552
that testing was more inhumane
than we have ever seen.

05:42.760 --> 05:43.720
- Can you be more specific

05:43.928 --> 05:45.805
without divulging your informants?

05:46.014 --> 05:48.349
- Our sources
reported, and I quote,

05:48.558 --> 05:50.977
"The testing we witnessed is more cruel,

05:51.185 --> 05:53.855
"more grotesquely evil
than the American people

05:54.063 --> 05:55.648
"could ever imagine."

05:58.735 --> 06:02.113
- Good morning, Mr. Murdoch.

06:02.322 --> 06:05.742
Good morning, Mr. Murdoch.

06:05.950 --> 06:10.830
Good morning, Mr. Murdoch.

06:23.426 --> 06:24.886
- Stay!

06:25.094 --> 06:26.471
- Good morning, Mr. Murdoch.

06:28.097 --> 06:30.767
- Handshake says a lot
about a man, Pinkus.

06:30.975 --> 06:31.809
- Yes sir.

06:42.612 --> 06:44.489
Can I get you a cup of coffee, sir?

06:44.697 --> 06:47.450
- Cut the pleasantries,
there's been a leak.

06:47.658 --> 06:48.576
- A leak?

06:49.827 --> 06:54.707
- PETA, People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals

06:55.124 --> 06:57.418
have launched an inquiry
with public relations.

06:58.378 --> 07:00.129
Where exactly is our facility

07:00.338 --> 07:02.465
and what exactly are we doing there?

07:02.673 --> 07:03.508
Now I'm asking myself

07:03.716 --> 07:04.675
how the hell did they find out about us?

07:04.884 --> 07:07.845
- Well I can assure you, Mr.
Murdoch, I will find out.

07:08.054 --> 07:10.306
- I am the public face of Wexel Hall,

07:10.515 --> 07:13.893
when that face is damaged, I am damaged.

07:14.102 --> 07:14.727
- I understand, sir.

07:14.936 --> 07:16.771
- Not to mention the fact
that every drug company

07:16.979 --> 07:18.773
in the world is crawling up our ass

07:18.981 --> 07:20.525
trying to beat us to the finish line.

07:20.733 --> 07:23.319
- I could double security
but until we've identified

07:23.528 --> 07:24.529
the source, it would be pointless.

07:24.737 --> 07:26.030
- It is your job!

07:26.239 --> 07:27.782
And you will do your job

07:27.990 --> 07:29.534
or the only thing you'll be supervising

07:29.742 --> 07:32.203
is a proctologist removing
my boot from your rectum,

07:32.412 --> 07:33.746
do you understand?

07:33.955 --> 07:35.081
- Yes sir.

07:35.289 --> 07:37.208
- What is the status of the project?

07:38.167 --> 07:38.960
- We've

07:39.877 --> 07:41.462
hit some delays.
- You've hit some delays?

07:41.671 --> 07:43.798
Now why is it I'm not surprised?

07:44.006 --> 07:45.633
What sort of delays?

07:45.842 --> 07:48.594
- Kane will answer all your questions.

07:49.595 --> 07:51.139
- Where is Kane?

07:56.686 --> 07:57.687
- Just this way, sir.

07:58.729 --> 08:02.150
This is a live feed of
the queen anaconda's tank.

08:06.654 --> 08:10.366
- Completely motionless,
just like my first wife.

08:10.575 --> 08:12.410
- Don't let her slumber fool you.

08:12.618 --> 08:15.329
She's 1,200 pounds of pure crushing power.

08:15.538 --> 08:16.164
As I said,

08:16.372 --> 08:17.623
just like my first wife.

08:17.832 --> 08:19.625
- Good to see you, Mr. Murdoch.

08:19.834 --> 08:21.752
I wasn't expecting you until next week.

08:21.961 --> 08:24.046
- Well, Professor, as you
know, I'm a man in a hurry.

08:24.255 --> 08:26.382
- Well, sir, our staff's
been working 'round the clock

08:26.591 --> 08:28.718
and I'm fully aware of your schedule.

08:28.926 --> 08:29.552
- Good,

08:29.760 --> 08:31.888
'cause I'm paying you for results.

08:32.096 --> 08:34.182
- As you know, we have
successfully synthesized

08:34.390 --> 08:36.601
and produced a blood orchid extract,

08:36.808 --> 08:39.770
our patient tolerates the
serum just like snakes

08:39.979 --> 08:42.648
in the wild do with zero
negative side effects

08:43.691 --> 08:45.693
and no signs of aging.

08:45.902 --> 08:48.571
- The synthetic serum
is fully efficacious.

08:48.779 --> 08:52.158
- Yes, at present only in snakes but

08:53.284 --> 08:55.536
there is something you must see.

08:55.745 --> 08:56.454
Please.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.207
- This is more like it.

09:06.422 --> 09:10.092
But tell me, what is it that
snakes have that we don't have?

09:10.301 --> 09:11.844
- We still have not determined

09:12.053 --> 09:14.764
why the extract is non-toxic in the snake

09:14.972 --> 09:16.516
but lethal in humans.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.518
- But you yourself told me
you'd made some progress.

09:18.726 --> 09:19.644
- There has been,

09:19.852 --> 09:23.189
we've reduced but not
eliminated the toxicity.

09:23.397 --> 09:26.526
- In dogs and in chimpanzees?
- Even mice.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.945
Mice administered a
steady dose of the serum

09:29.153 --> 09:31.072
show signs of a reduced rate of aging.

09:34.325 --> 09:36.786
But ultimately, they die,

09:36.994 --> 09:39.539
from some mechanism I
don't fully understand.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.378
- Mr. Murdoch, this is Darryl.

09:46.420 --> 09:47.547
- Hello Darryl.

09:47.755 --> 09:49.048
- Nice to meet you, sir.

09:49.257 --> 09:50.758
- This way, sir.
- Impressive.

09:55.012 --> 09:55.972
Oh, very impressive.

09:57.139 --> 09:59.058
- Well, the bottom line, Mr. Murdoch

09:59.267 --> 10:02.687
is that we've developed a
second-generation serum by

10:02.895 --> 10:04.730
producing a new strain of the orchid.

10:05.690 --> 10:09.402
We hope to solve the
problem at the source.

10:10.903 --> 10:13.698
Behold the miracle of modern science.

10:17.285 --> 10:17.994
- Behold the miracle?

10:18.202 --> 10:19.996
I can't see anything.

10:20.204 --> 10:23.165
- We keep it dark to create
an artificial sleep cycle

10:23.374 --> 10:24.375
for the creature.

10:34.927 --> 10:36.470
Ugly son of a bitch, isn't it?

10:37.471 --> 10:38.556
- What is that?

10:38.764 --> 10:40.766
- It was a typical anaconda.

10:41.934 --> 10:43.769
It certainly isn't typical now.

10:56.198 --> 10:58.492
- How's my baby doing today?
- He's hungry again.

10:59.577 --> 11:00.661
- What's the ambient temp in the cage?

11:00.870 --> 11:01.746
- 65.

11:01.954 --> 11:03.497
- All right, let's cozy it up five degrees

11:03.706 --> 11:05.708
and increase the sentinel mix by 20 CCs.

11:05.916 --> 11:06.917
- Okay.

11:07.126 --> 11:10.087
- Are you telling me a
regular dosage of serum

11:10.296 --> 11:12.006
is what's produced this?

11:12.214 --> 11:14.216
- For the most part we wanted
to see if heavy dosages--

11:14.425 --> 11:17.345
- Amazing, four months ago
he could fit in a shoebox.

11:17.553 --> 11:19.263
- Yeah, that's probably
how he feels right now.

11:19.472 --> 11:21.057
- Suits are here.
- Yeah, I know,

11:21.265 --> 11:23.142
and I intend to find out why.

11:23.351 --> 11:25.061
- In fact, quite the opposite.

11:25.269 --> 11:27.146
It's bigger, faster, stronger.

11:27.355 --> 11:28.689
- And a hell of a lot meaner.

11:29.649 --> 11:31.817
We're making great progress but
we need larger holding tanks

11:32.026 --> 11:33.152
and additional security.

11:33.361 --> 11:35.279
- I was getting to that.

11:35.488 --> 11:36.822
- Were you?

11:37.031 --> 11:40.493
- Mr. Murdoch, our
herpetologist, Dr. Amanda Hayes.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.286
- I've submitted four requests to Pinkus

11:42.495 --> 11:44.455
and every time his answer
is, "It's not my call."

11:44.664 --> 11:46.666
So whose call is it?

11:46.874 --> 11:48.084
Yours, Mr. Murdoch?

11:48.292 --> 11:51.003
Please excuse Dr. Hayes.

11:51.212 --> 11:52.797
She's not familiar with the protocol.

11:53.005 --> 11:54.632
- Oh I'm very familiar with the protocol,

11:54.840 --> 11:56.175
I'm just doing what you pay me for,

11:56.384 --> 11:58.177
minding the wellbeing of our reptiles

11:58.386 --> 11:59.679
and watching our asses.

12:01.180 --> 12:02.139
- Dr. Hayes,

12:02.348 --> 12:05.351
you give me a marketable
product and I will buy you

12:05.559 --> 12:08.813
the biggest animal park
this side of the equator.

12:09.021 --> 12:11.190
- We need larger facilities now.

12:11.399 --> 12:12.066
- I'll see what I can do.

12:12.274 --> 12:13.859
- You have to do better than that,

12:14.068 --> 12:15.695
you're not the one handling 60-foot snakes

12:15.903 --> 12:17.029
with massive appetites.

12:17.238 --> 12:19.907
We are under staffed and
in way over our heads.

12:26.580 --> 12:27.915
- What does she mean by that?

12:29.709 --> 12:32.044
- If you'll excuse me, gentlemen,

12:32.253 --> 12:34.547
I have some cultures to examine.

12:34.755 --> 12:35.464
Pinkus.

12:37.842 --> 12:38.843
- It's nothing.

12:39.051 --> 12:39.760
- Nothing?

12:42.221 --> 12:43.973
I'm paying you an obscene amount of money

12:44.181 --> 12:45.766
to keep this research on track.

12:45.975 --> 12:48.978
It is clearly not on track.

12:49.186 --> 12:53.357
And my very expensive
expert there is concerned!

12:53.566 --> 12:55.067
- Money is not the problem.

12:55.276 --> 12:56.944
If we stopped every
time we needed to expand

12:57.153 --> 12:59.029
or upgrade, we'd be months behind.

12:59.238 --> 13:02.241
Everything here is custom
made, it takes time.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.954
- Time is what I do not have.

13:10.499 --> 13:11.333
- Amanda.
- Sir.

13:11.542 --> 13:12.460
- Excuse us.
- Sure.

13:14.336 --> 13:16.005
- What is the matter with you?

13:16.213 --> 13:19.925
- I didn't go to med school
to serve a life sentence.

13:20.134 --> 13:21.635
- It's just a means to an end.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.012
- Whose end?

13:23.220 --> 13:24.096
For what?

13:24.305 --> 13:26.599
So some sick billionaire can defeat death?

13:26.807 --> 13:27.641
- What do you mean he's sick?

13:27.850 --> 13:30.186
- Oh come on, Eric, you didn't see it?

13:30.394 --> 13:32.897
Pupils dilated, pale skin, coughing?

13:33.105 --> 13:35.024
Not to mention his severe weight loss.

13:36.358 --> 13:39.361
Looks to me like he's got
cancer which means he's dying.

13:39.570 --> 13:40.279
- Amanda,

13:41.405 --> 13:44.283
we're at the brink of
saving millions of lives.

13:44.492 --> 13:47.286
Can you imagine a drug that
could revitalize cancer patients

13:47.495 --> 13:48.621
and reverse Alzheimer's?

13:49.705 --> 13:52.124
- Do you really still believe that?

13:52.333 --> 13:53.042
- Don't you?

13:53.959 --> 13:55.461
- I don't know.

13:55.669 --> 13:57.963
For something that's
supposed to be so good,

13:58.172 --> 13:59.924
why does it feel wrong?

14:00.132 --> 14:01.091
- You knew what we were doing

14:01.300 --> 14:01.967
when we started the research, Amanda.

14:02.176 --> 14:03.844
- Yeah, but I expected it to be handled

14:04.053 --> 14:05.179
with more responsibility.

14:06.222 --> 14:08.641
We are tampering with evolution, Eric.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.434
Come on, it's

14:11.519 --> 14:12.603
just a big snake.

14:14.897 --> 14:17.483
- Yeah, well that's
definitely an understatement.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.319
All right, I'll talk to you later, okay?

14:20.528 --> 14:21.737
- Okay.

14:34.083 --> 14:35.793
- Bigger, tougher, meaner, eh?

14:36.001 --> 14:37.253
I could use a bit of that.

14:38.420 --> 14:39.588
- That's not a good idea, sir.

14:39.797 --> 14:40.714
- And you're telling me it's the serum

14:40.923 --> 14:42.842
that's responsible for this?

14:43.050 --> 14:44.218
- Sir.
- Amazing.

14:44.426 --> 14:46.595
- Sir, turn that light off.

14:46.804 --> 14:49.181
Turn that light off!

14:49.390 --> 14:50.558
- What the hell happened there?

14:50.766 --> 14:52.810
Pinkus?

14:53.018 --> 14:55.938
The warning lights in the
tank are starting to go crazy.

14:56.146 --> 14:57.064
What's going on?

14:57.273 --> 14:58.399
- I told you not to do that.

14:58.607 --> 14:59.233
Darryl?
- What's going on?

14:59.441 --> 15:01.318
- Hit the gas.
- What's going on?

15:01.527 --> 15:02.778
Hey!
- More lights are flashing.

15:02.987 --> 15:04.989
There's a lot of movement!

15:06.031 --> 15:07.449
- Don't you touch that gas!
- Darryl!

15:07.658 --> 15:09.702
- You'll kill it!
- Hit the god damn gas!

15:09.910 --> 15:13.247
- Wait, you're gonna kill him!
- No, we're not killing him.

15:13.455 --> 15:14.832
- Don't, turn the gas off!
- Please!

15:15.040 --> 15:17.626
- You'll kill him!

15:17.835 --> 15:18.460
I won't let you kill it!

15:18.669 --> 15:21.088
- Sir, sir, calm down, it
will only sedate the snake.

15:21.297 --> 15:22.464
- Don't you tell me to calm down!

15:22.673 --> 15:23.841
Darryl!

15:24.049 --> 15:26.135
Darryl, what's that?
- What's happening?

15:26.343 --> 15:26.969
- Darryl!

15:27.177 --> 15:27.887
Look, look.
- What?

15:28.095 --> 15:29.096
- Don't worry, Mr. Murdoch,

15:29.305 --> 15:30.681
that's three-inch polycarbonate glass.

15:30.890 --> 15:32.391
- Well it's not enough.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.104
What's he doing?
- Everybody just stay calm.

15:37.313 --> 15:38.647
The gas will sedate it.

15:38.856 --> 15:41.275
- Are you sure?
- He'll settle down, I'm sure.

15:46.030 --> 15:47.615
- Everybody calm down.

15:53.370 --> 15:54.163
It's fine.

15:56.582 --> 15:57.374
- Finally.

15:58.334 --> 15:59.919
- Let's just leave him be.

16:01.128 --> 16:04.590
Darryl, call Kane, let
him know what happened.

16:04.798 --> 16:05.591
I'll call the technicians

16:05.799 --> 16:07.760
to get this repaired.
- All right.

16:11.597 --> 16:12.222
- Darryl!

16:12.431 --> 16:13.307
Hit the alarm, lock us down!

16:13.515 --> 16:15.476
- Hit the alarm, hit the alarm!

16:15.684 --> 16:19.605
- Remember--

16:19.813 --> 16:20.898
- Everyone outside.

16:21.106 --> 16:23.233
Stay calm, everyone outside, let's go!

16:23.442 --> 16:24.860
- We're safe here, right?
- We gotta help him.

16:25.069 --> 16:25.694
- Right?

16:25.903 --> 16:26.612
Screw him!
- He's my friend!

16:26.820 --> 16:28.364
- There's a monster out there!
- He's my friend,

16:28.572 --> 16:29.782
I gotta help him!
- The gas!

16:29.990 --> 16:32.493
If the snake doesn't get ya, the gas will!

16:32.701 --> 16:34.495
Now shut up!

16:36.789 --> 16:38.374
- Oh my god.

16:38.582 --> 16:39.208
- What happened?

16:39.416 --> 16:40.376
- What do you think happened?

16:40.584 --> 16:42.002
- What the hell did
you do, where's Darryl?

16:42.211 --> 16:43.796
- Darryl didn't make it!

16:45.381 --> 16:47.508
- We've gotta go, let's go!

16:47.716 --> 16:49.426
- You said the gas would knock it out!

16:49.635 --> 16:50.719
- He's looking for a way out.

16:50.928 --> 16:51.887
- We have to contain him.

16:52.096 --> 16:54.348
Security, go on full lock
down, I repeat, full lockdown.

16:54.556 --> 16:57.184
- Yes sir, I understand sir,
I'm locking down right now.

16:58.477 --> 16:59.561
- Amanda, get the guns!

16:59.770 --> 17:01.021
Hey, where do you think you're going?

17:01.230 --> 17:02.773
- All personnel
should exit immediately

17:02.982 --> 17:03.857
to your designated safety zone.

17:04.066 --> 17:05.275
- I'm getting Murdoch outta here.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.569
- Nobody's going anywhere, grab a gun!

17:10.446 --> 17:12.907
- All personnel
should proceed immediately to--

17:13.117 --> 17:14.242
- No way, I'm getting outta here!

17:14.451 --> 17:15.160
- Pinkus!

17:16.203 --> 17:17.079
Take the gun!

17:18.204 --> 17:20.249
- This is not
a drill, all personnel--

17:20.457 --> 17:21.875
Proceed immediately to your

17:22.084 --> 17:26.005
designated safety zones.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.256
This is not a drill.

17:27.464 --> 17:29.216
- The sedatives must've taken effect.

17:29.425 --> 17:30.592
- Are you sure?

17:30.801 --> 17:34.138
- Yeah, that stuff will
knock out 10 rhinos.

17:34.346 --> 17:36.849
- It's a stun gas, it only
lasts for five minutes.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.434
- You're right, Amanda, get the masks.

17:38.642 --> 17:40.185
- All personnel should--
- Pinkus,

17:40.394 --> 17:42.438
escort Mr. Murdoch out of here.

17:42.646 --> 17:43.397
- Yeah, yeah.

17:45.315 --> 17:46.608
Sir?

17:46.817 --> 17:47.860
- This is not a drill.

17:48.068 --> 17:50.029
All personnel should exit the facility

17:50.237 --> 17:52.114
to their designated safety zones.

17:56.160 --> 17:57.453
- Get out!
- This is not a drill.

17:57.661 --> 17:59.288
All personnel should exit immediately

17:59.496 --> 18:01.957
to your designated safety zone.

18:02.875 --> 18:04.585
- Is she outside already?
- She's already gone.

18:04.793 --> 18:07.004
This is not a drill.

18:07.212 --> 18:08.797
All personnel should exit immediately

18:09.006 --> 18:11.467
to your designated safety zone.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.346
This is not a drill.

18:16.555 --> 18:18.390
All personnel should exit immediately

18:18.599 --> 18:21.060
to your designated safety zone.

18:24.438 --> 18:27.733
This is not a drill, all
personnel should exit immediately

18:27.941 --> 18:30.402
to your designated safety zone.

18:33.906 --> 18:35.532
This is not a drill.

18:37.242 --> 18:38.911
This is not a drill...

18:46.460 --> 18:49.088
This is not a drill.

18:49.296 --> 18:52.257
Immediately to your
designated safety zone.

18:52.466 --> 18:53.675
- Okay.

18:55.260 --> 18:56.929
Oh god.
- This is not a drill.

18:57.137 --> 18:58.138
- It's Darryl.
- All personnel should exit

18:58.347 --> 19:01.350
immediately to your
designated safety zone.

19:01.558 --> 19:02.601
- Are you okay?

19:02.810 --> 19:04.686
- Come on,
let's get through this.

19:04.895 --> 19:06.688
- This is not a drill, all personnel

19:06.897 --> 19:08.816
should exit immediately
to your designated--

19:09.024 --> 19:10.526
- Where is he?

19:10.734 --> 19:11.443
Over here?

19:14.238 --> 19:15.531
- This is not a drill.

19:15.739 --> 19:17.366
All personnel should exit--
- Where is it?

19:17.574 --> 19:20.452
- Immediately to
your designated safety zone.

19:20.661 --> 19:21.829
- Oh no.

19:22.037 --> 19:23.622
- He's not in here!

19:23.831 --> 19:24.623
- This is not a drill.
- Where would he go?

19:24.832 --> 19:26.834
- I don't know but
we better find him fast.

19:27.042 --> 19:28.460
- The queen,
he's gone after the queen.

19:28.669 --> 19:30.129
- Let's go!
- Come on.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.384
- This is not
a drill, all personnel

19:35.592 --> 19:38.720
should proceed immediately to
their designated safety zone.

19:38.929 --> 19:40.973
- How are we going to explain
that one, hmm, Pinkus?

19:42.516 --> 19:45.310
Don't tell me you haven't
got a backup lighting system.

19:45.519 --> 19:46.353
Please don't tell me.
- No, no,

19:46.562 --> 19:48.272
it should come on in a minute, sir.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.399
- Let's get outta here, quickly, quickly!

19:52.568 --> 19:53.777
- Oh god.

20:12.963 --> 20:13.672
Oh god.

20:14.548 --> 20:15.883
- I hate when you're right.

20:16.884 --> 20:17.676
- So do I.

20:24.433 --> 20:25.142
Susan.

20:26.518 --> 20:27.311
Oh no.

20:45.454 --> 20:46.455
Oh no, she's gone.

20:59.009 --> 21:00.552
- He broke her out.

21:04.014 --> 21:05.891
- This is all my fault.

21:10.938 --> 21:11.897
- Run!

22:30.225 --> 22:32.644
- Have you any idea what this
is going to cost to cover up?

22:32.853 --> 22:33.520
- Yes.

22:33.729 --> 22:35.355
No, I mean, yes, I know exactly--

22:35.564 --> 22:37.357
- I want this place clean!

22:37.566 --> 22:39.693
I want it cleaned properly!

22:40.736 --> 22:41.528
- Sir.

22:41.737 --> 22:44.364
Might I advise that we can
still salvage the situation?

22:45.407 --> 22:46.867
The on-site security team is already here

22:47.075 --> 22:48.410
and we have a team of
professional trackers

22:48.618 --> 22:49.536
on their way here as we speak.

22:49.745 --> 22:51.913
- You do whatever you have to do!

22:52.122 --> 22:54.041
But you will be with them 24 hours a day.

22:55.125 --> 22:55.834
- What do you mean, sir?

22:56.043 --> 22:59.212
- You're a supervisor, Pinkus, supervise.

22:59.421 --> 23:01.798
Otherwise I will have them
test that serum on you.

23:06.386 --> 23:07.763
- Sir, I don't do field work, I--

23:07.971 --> 23:11.141
- I want news, Pinkus!

23:11.350 --> 23:12.809
Good news!
- Pinkus.

23:13.018 --> 23:13.727
Name's Grozny.

23:21.109 --> 23:24.488
- Until I hear good news,
you will report to me hourly.

23:25.572 --> 23:26.365
- Yes sir.

23:29.826 --> 23:31.328
Grozny,

23:31.536 --> 23:32.245
follow me.

23:33.330 --> 23:34.873
I'll brief you on the situation.

23:46.802 --> 23:49.679
- Nine guys, it took five
shots to bring him down.

23:49.888 --> 23:51.640
- We'll give you 20, that's market rate.

23:53.225 --> 23:57.104
- Look, guys, I don't care
what kinky plans you're into

23:57.312 --> 24:00.482
but these are five-pound Java rhino horns

24:00.690 --> 24:03.485
so I suggest you go to an ATM teller,

24:03.693 --> 24:05.862
one that dispenses some respect.

24:06.780 --> 24:08.156
30 thousand or nothin'.

24:19.584 --> 24:20.377
- Deal.

24:29.428 --> 24:30.846
- Always a pleasure.

24:34.307 --> 24:35.100
Pleasure.

24:40.147 --> 24:41.398
- Give us the envelope.

24:42.274 --> 24:45.735
- Okay, I got 30 thousand
dollars in crisp American bills,

24:45.944 --> 24:48.029
now if you want Euros you're
gonna have to go to Greece

24:48.238 --> 24:50.365
or a bank, I kinda get them confused.

24:53.785 --> 24:54.494
Hang on.

24:57.205 --> 24:58.498
Yeah?

24:58.707 --> 24:59.416
Pinkus!

25:00.417 --> 25:02.169
I'm a little busy right now.

25:02.377 --> 25:03.086
- What?

25:04.296 --> 25:05.839
- Oh, let me guess.

25:06.047 --> 25:08.758
You didn't reinforce the
cages and the snakes got out.

25:09.926 --> 25:11.928
- This is serious, we are prepared to pay

25:12.137 --> 25:13.847
and I need you here to lead the team.

25:14.055 --> 25:15.849
- Yeah, I'll be there as soon as I can.

25:18.143 --> 25:20.228
What?

25:20.437 --> 25:21.062
What?

25:21.271 --> 25:21.980
What's your name?

25:22.189 --> 25:23.523
- Florian.

25:23.732 --> 25:25.150
- Florian?

25:25.358 --> 25:26.985
For you.
- What?

25:39.873 --> 25:43.710
- Always know the animal before the hunt.

25:52.802 --> 25:54.888
- Sonya, Sonya.

26:04.105 --> 26:06.566
- These creatures are one of a kind,

26:06.775 --> 26:08.485
growing to become 60 feet long.

26:08.693 --> 26:10.987
- 60 foot snakes?
- I got one of those.

26:11.196 --> 26:12.280
Dreamer.

26:12.489 --> 26:13.198
- Please!

26:16.201 --> 26:18.537
They are fast and very strong,

26:19.496 --> 26:20.956
having never dealt with
anything quite like this,

26:21.164 --> 26:23.708
I urge you to use extreme caution.

26:24.709 --> 26:28.129
We must bring them down, it is imperative.

26:28.338 --> 26:29.297
- And they are more than 60 feet--

26:29.506 --> 26:30.840
- Thank you, Dr. Hayes!

26:31.800 --> 26:33.343
I will handle this briefing.

26:33.552 --> 26:35.595
- My team and I know these
woods like our own backyard.

26:35.804 --> 26:39.224
- It's easier than that, we
also know their location.

26:40.350 --> 26:43.395
We try and keep a short
leash on our investments.

26:43.603 --> 26:44.896
In case of emergencies.

26:45.105 --> 26:46.189
- We're moving out in 10.

26:46.398 --> 26:48.149
- Hammett's on his way
here, we should wait.

26:48.358 --> 26:50.151
- We're not waiting for
Hammett, not when we know

26:50.360 --> 26:53.196
where the snakes are,
we need to strike fast.

26:53.405 --> 26:55.615
Like I said, we move out in 10.

26:57.117 --> 26:57.826
- Man, he wants all the glory.

26:58.034 --> 26:59.077
- You're right about that,

26:59.286 --> 27:01.079
you know how he feels about Hammett.

27:01.288 --> 27:02.497
- Yep.
- You heard the man,

27:02.706 --> 27:03.957
10 minutes.

27:04.165 --> 27:05.875
- I need to speak with you privately.

27:09.254 --> 27:11.214
Why haven't you called the
government or the military?

27:11.423 --> 27:13.550
- Because the company's
handling this matter privately.

27:13.758 --> 27:15.885
- The company has no idea
what we're dealing with!

27:16.094 --> 27:16.928
- Dr. Hayes, do I need to remind you

27:17.137 --> 27:19.889
that you signed a strict
confidentiality contract?

27:20.098 --> 27:21.141
- There are innocent people out there

27:21.349 --> 27:22.517
that need to be warned.

27:22.726 --> 27:25.228
- Our professionals will
resolve this matter swiftly

27:25.437 --> 27:27.147
and efficiently, and as for you,

27:27.355 --> 27:30.150
take this as a friendly
warning, do not interfere!

27:30.358 --> 27:32.319
- I am responsible for those animals,

27:32.527 --> 27:34.404
nobody knows their
behavior better than me.

27:34.613 --> 27:35.905
Those snakes aren't gonna bask in the sun

27:36.114 --> 27:37.115
and roll over for you.

27:38.074 --> 27:39.200
I'm coming with you.

27:47.626 --> 27:49.252
You're not the one handling 60-foot snakes

27:49.461 --> 27:51.588
with massive appetites,
we are understaffed

27:51.796 --> 27:53.590
and in way over our heads.

27:55.175 --> 27:57.469
- Can you imagine a drug
that could revitalize

27:57.677 --> 28:00.430
cancer patients and reverse Alzheimer's?

28:00.639 --> 28:01.973
- Do you really believe that?

28:02.932 --> 28:03.683
- Don't you?

28:03.892 --> 28:06.311
Please excuse Dr. Hayes,

28:06.519 --> 28:08.605
she's not familiar with the protocol.

28:14.944 --> 28:15.945
- Ms. Hayes?

28:17.572 --> 28:18.365
Ms. Hayes?

28:19.366 --> 28:20.158
- Yeah?

28:21.242 --> 28:22.577
- You like traveling light.

28:23.495 --> 28:26.831
- Oh, I don't think I'd feel
really comfortable with that.

28:28.083 --> 28:28.792
- Well it would make you comfortable

28:29.000 --> 28:32.170
if you ever came face to
face with a 60-foot snake.

28:32.379 --> 28:33.213
- I already have, remember?

28:33.421 --> 28:34.339
I helped create them.

28:35.548 --> 28:37.217
Besides, that's why you guys are here.

28:37.425 --> 28:39.719
- I'm just trying to give you
the best chance to survive.

28:39.928 --> 28:42.681
- It's no problem, Amanda,
just stick with Nick.

28:44.057 --> 28:47.143
Nick, introduce her to the bazooka.

28:50.730 --> 28:51.523
- The bazooka.

28:54.067 --> 28:56.111
24 knockouts, regional city champ.

29:07.956 --> 29:09.666
- Hey, can I see that gun again?

29:16.589 --> 29:17.632
- Whoa, whoa.

29:19.759 --> 29:20.719
- Oh, sorry.

29:27.016 --> 29:28.476
- Hey, Dragosh?
- Hmm?

29:28.685 --> 29:31.271
- They say you should
never look them in the eye.

29:31.479 --> 29:33.148
And, what else?

29:33.356 --> 29:35.817
- They have the powers of mesmerize.

29:36.025 --> 29:37.610
That's proof.

29:37.819 --> 29:39.654
- No, no, no, no, no, it's true.

29:39.863 --> 29:40.989
I heard the story of a hunter

29:41.197 --> 29:43.783
who stared in the eyes
of the anaconda too long.

29:45.160 --> 29:48.204
Suddenly, he was hypnotized.

29:49.581 --> 29:50.874
He swallowed him alive.

29:53.501 --> 29:55.754
- You want me to stuff this
rifle down your throat?

29:55.962 --> 29:58.965
- Don't be an ass, Andrei, you
know he's afraid of snakes.

29:59.174 --> 30:02.427
- I'm not afraid of snakes,
I just don't like them.

30:02.635 --> 30:03.928
- You don't have to like 'em,

30:04.137 --> 30:05.597
you just have to like killing 'em.

30:05.805 --> 30:07.056
- I'm fine with that.

35:24.123 --> 35:24.999
- We're close.

35:25.208 --> 35:26.417
- Good.

35:27.502 --> 35:29.003
- Got it.
- Follow them.

35:33.633 --> 35:34.842
- Ugh, finally.

35:59.408 --> 36:00.993
- Well the signal's
coming from around here,

36:01.202 --> 36:03.538
it could be anywhere within 100 yards.

36:04.664 --> 36:05.915
- These bastards detect heat,

36:06.124 --> 36:09.001
so you're always prone to
attack, don't forget that.

36:11.921 --> 36:13.464
Nick, Andrei, see who's home.

36:15.550 --> 36:17.468
Dragosh, check the barn.
- All right.

36:17.677 --> 36:18.553
- You two, 'round the back.

36:18.761 --> 36:21.472
- Let's go.
- Come on, let's go.

36:21.681 --> 36:23.349
- What about us?

36:23.558 --> 36:25.393
- Mr. Pinkus, Ms. Hayes,

36:26.269 --> 36:27.145
stay put!

36:28.187 --> 36:29.522
- If they were here
you'd see some evidence.

36:29.730 --> 36:31.440
- Yeah, you're absolutely right.

36:31.649 --> 36:33.276
That's why we're looking around.

36:33.484 --> 36:34.193
- Grozny.

36:35.361 --> 36:36.529
You may need this.

36:39.282 --> 36:40.074
- Thanks.

36:56.007 --> 36:57.842
- Hello, anybody home?

37:00.136 --> 37:01.929
Hello?

37:02.138 --> 37:02.847
- Try the door.

37:07.977 --> 37:09.520
- It's not locked.

37:09.729 --> 37:11.105
Why would it be?

37:44.347 --> 37:47.391
It's like Little House on the Prairie.

37:59.654 --> 38:01.239
- Let's check around the back.

38:08.037 --> 38:08.829
- I'm

38:09.914 --> 38:11.958
sorry about the Professor.

38:14.543 --> 38:15.544
He was a good man.

38:17.421 --> 38:18.798
- Yeah, thanks.

38:19.006 --> 38:20.675
- Dragosh, it's reading we're close.

38:21.676 --> 38:23.261
Keep your eyes peeled.

38:27.014 --> 38:27.974
- All clear!

38:29.809 --> 38:31.727
- Listen, I'm goin' in,
I can't wait anymore.

38:33.479 --> 38:35.231
- You go 'round back, I'll take front.

38:35.439 --> 38:36.148
- Okay.

38:38.150 --> 38:39.735
- Let's go check over there.

39:01.465 --> 39:02.466
- Hey, better safe than sorry, huh?

39:02.675 --> 39:05.177
- Be vigilant guys, we know it's nearby.

39:05.386 --> 39:06.929
- Come on guys, it's 60 feet long.

39:09.807 --> 39:12.268
- The place is deserted, maybe
they went out for supplies?

39:19.150 --> 39:20.443
That's slightly disturbing.

39:24.405 --> 39:25.573
- What happened to it?

39:25.781 --> 39:28.451
- Well when they don't like
a meal they spit it back up.

39:29.368 --> 39:30.286
- I'd eat it.

39:32.997 --> 39:35.458
Come on, guys, it's just a goat.

39:35.666 --> 39:38.419
- If these beasts only
eat things that look good,

39:38.627 --> 39:42.048
if I were you, Ms. Hayes,
I'd be very careful.

39:42.256 --> 39:44.050
- Excuse me?
- I hate to interrupt

39:44.258 --> 39:46.302
but we've got a job to do.

39:46.510 --> 39:47.511
- Over here!

39:49.555 --> 39:52.058
- Dragosh, Nick, you stay here!

39:52.266 --> 39:53.768
Andrei, hang back.

40:12.578 --> 40:13.371
- Whoa.

40:16.290 --> 40:18.209
- Well that makes things
a little more difficult.

40:18.417 --> 40:20.002
- Tight leash, isn't that
what you said, Pinkus?

40:20.211 --> 40:21.879
- All right, let's put plan B into effect.

40:22.088 --> 40:23.923
- And what might that be?

40:24.131 --> 40:25.007
- Dunno yet.

40:26.509 --> 40:29.470
I don't understand how it shed so quickly.

40:29.678 --> 40:30.846
- Ecdysis, it only happens when the snake

40:31.055 --> 40:33.015
grows too large for its skin,

40:33.224 --> 40:35.935
which means it's growing pretty damn fast.

40:38.562 --> 40:40.314
- All right, Victor,

40:40.523 --> 40:42.274
I want you to start putting
the supplies in order.

40:42.483 --> 40:44.985
Dragosh, set up a lookout around here.

40:45.194 --> 40:46.237
Andrei, 'round the back!

40:46.445 --> 40:47.863
Nick--

40:48.072 --> 40:50.866
Shoot it!

40:57.415 --> 40:58.457
- Oh god, no!

41:01.961 --> 41:05.589
- Shoot it, go, let's go!

41:05.798 --> 41:06.507
Shoot it!

41:09.051 --> 41:09.927
Over there!

41:16.851 --> 41:17.643
Go, go!

41:22.606 --> 41:25.109
Take that, you son of a bitch!

41:25.317 --> 41:26.402
Go, go, go!

41:26.610 --> 41:28.487
- Come on, come on!
- Go!

41:29.697 --> 41:31.365
- Get something, check the jeep!

41:31.574 --> 41:34.493
- There it is!
- Quick, get my bag.

41:39.623 --> 41:40.583
Get it!

41:42.084 --> 41:43.544
- How is he?

41:47.840 --> 41:49.133
- Dragosh!

42:10.279 --> 42:13.157
- Cease fire, cease fire!

42:13.365 --> 42:14.867
Amanda, help Grozny!

42:15.910 --> 42:19.163
Pinkus, in Grozny's Jeep
there's a fire extinguisher!

42:21.832 --> 42:24.502
The rest of you, follow
me, we end this now!

42:24.710 --> 42:25.920
Come on!
- Right.

42:26.128 --> 42:28.422
- Let's go, come on!

42:28.631 --> 42:30.174
- Fire extinguisher.

42:31.467 --> 42:32.343
- Hurry up!

42:43.812 --> 42:45.856
- What?
- Sophia, Andrei.

42:46.065 --> 42:47.566
- Do it!

42:47.775 --> 42:49.109
- Victor.
- Get the bag over here!

42:49.318 --> 42:52.571
Now, quick, hurry up, hurry up, come on!

42:52.780 --> 42:54.406
Get my bag!
- Where is it?

42:54.615 --> 42:56.200
- Hurry up!
- What?

42:56.408 --> 42:58.369
- Come on!
- I'm coming!

42:59.703 --> 43:01.372
- Open it up, quick, hurry!

43:01.580 --> 43:02.706
- Okay, hold on!

43:02.915 --> 43:04.333
I don't know which one--
- Hold him down first.

43:04.542 --> 43:05.543
- Here!
- Give me the elastic.

43:05.751 --> 43:07.127
- There, there, there, there!
- No, the elastic!

43:07.336 --> 43:09.088
- I don't know, I don't know!

43:09.296 --> 43:10.297
- Give me the elastic.
- There, there, there!

43:10.506 --> 43:12.132
- Okay, now hold him down, hold him down.

43:12.341 --> 43:13.592
- Okay.
- Now pinch off this artery.

43:13.801 --> 43:15.553
- I don't know what I'm doing!
- Just pinch of this artery!

43:15.761 --> 43:17.930
Hang in there!
- Oh my god!

43:18.138 --> 43:19.014
I don't know what I'm doing, Amanda!

43:19.223 --> 43:19.848
- Okay, just push!

43:20.057 --> 43:21.350
- I don't know what I'm doing!
- Just put pressure

43:21.559 --> 43:23.477
and don't let go, right
here, don't let go.

43:23.686 --> 43:25.020
- Okay, okay.
- Okay?

43:25.229 --> 43:27.523
- It's okay, Grozny!

43:49.461 --> 43:50.254
- Come on.

43:51.213 --> 43:53.841
Here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

43:55.301 --> 43:56.427
Where are ya?

44:02.933 --> 44:04.893
Why are you hiding, huh?

44:09.189 --> 44:10.649
Come on.

44:12.651 --> 44:14.111
- I see it!
- Where, where?

44:14.320 --> 44:16.655
- 12 o'clock!

44:16.864 --> 44:17.740
- Follow it!

44:48.312 --> 44:49.021
- There.

44:53.233 --> 44:54.777
- Damn, it's big.
- Let's go!

44:55.778 --> 44:57.196
- Sofia!

44:57.404 --> 44:58.447
Sofia!

45:04.161 --> 45:04.953
- Come on.

45:06.080 --> 45:07.748
Got somethin' for ya.

45:16.173 --> 45:17.466
That's not good.

45:18.509 --> 45:21.053
- Put pressure!
- Amanda I don't feel a pulse!

45:21.261 --> 45:22.721
He doesn't have a pulse!
- Just shut the hell up!

45:22.930 --> 45:25.140
- Amanda, it's over, Amanda, he is gone!

45:25.349 --> 45:28.310
- Shut the hell up just put--
- Amanda, it's over!

45:28.519 --> 45:30.479
- No, just come on!

45:30.688 --> 45:31.605
Come on.

45:31.814 --> 45:33.607
- Amanda, he's dead!

45:33.816 --> 45:34.525
- Come on.

45:35.943 --> 45:37.403
Come on.

46:43.343 --> 46:44.595
- Victor.

46:44.803 --> 46:45.512
- Come on.

47:16.460 --> 47:17.503
- Don't move.

47:41.568 --> 47:42.611
- Boy, you take the cake
for leaving without me.

47:42.820 --> 47:44.696
- Well it wasn't my idea!

47:44.905 --> 47:45.989
- We have to find it, we have to kill it!

47:46.198 --> 47:48.450
- Take it easy, what do you
wanna do, grab it by the tail?

47:48.659 --> 47:49.785
We're gonna find this thing, all right?

47:49.993 --> 47:50.828
Relax, relax.

47:51.036 --> 47:52.037
- It's about time, Hammett.

47:52.246 --> 47:53.163
- Yeah, good to see you too, Nick.

47:53.372 --> 47:54.540
Everybody come on, gather 'round here,

47:54.748 --> 47:55.666
we gotta make a plan!

47:56.750 --> 47:57.960
- Hammett!
- Andrei,

47:58.168 --> 47:59.795
get the steel case in the back of my car.

48:00.003 --> 48:00.963
All right, listen up, guys.

48:01.171 --> 48:02.840
We've all worked together before,

48:03.048 --> 48:04.258
there's simple rules, okay?

48:04.466 --> 48:07.302
Once you see this thing you
unload everything you can

48:07.511 --> 48:10.472
until it stops moving and
you shoot only for the head.

48:10.681 --> 48:12.766
Nothin' else will bring
this thing down, you got it?

48:12.975 --> 48:14.101
You follow my lead, I'll take you right up

48:14.309 --> 48:15.352
the snake's ass, all right?

48:15.561 --> 48:17.437
Let's go.
- What's that?

48:17.646 --> 48:18.689
- It's a tracking device.

48:18.897 --> 48:21.149
- Victor, you, Sofia, Amanda in the Jeep.

48:21.358 --> 48:23.652
Nick, Pinkus, you're with me and Andrei.

48:26.947 --> 48:28.323
- I think I'll stay here.

48:28.532 --> 48:31.159
- Suit yourself, but you're
gonna miss all the excitement.

49:21.585 --> 49:23.962
- We're getting close, the
signal is becoming stronger.

49:24.171 --> 49:26.381
Good.

49:32.679 --> 49:33.472
- There!

49:34.556 --> 49:37.100
Come on, don't lose him!

49:37.309 --> 49:39.269
We're almost there.

49:39.478 --> 49:41.229
- Stay with them.
- I am!

49:41.438 --> 49:42.814
- Come on!

49:46.568 --> 49:47.611
- This way, quick.

49:49.947 --> 49:51.031
- We got it.

49:51.239 --> 49:52.699
I repeat, we got it.

49:52.908 --> 49:54.284
Stay on it.
- I am trying!

49:54.493 --> 49:55.202
- Try harder!

49:58.205 --> 50:01.625
- Andrei, lose the tracker,
we're on to him now.

50:01.833 --> 50:05.545
- It's the end of the
line for these bastards.

50:17.265 --> 50:20.477
- Damn it, try to keep this car steady!

50:29.569 --> 50:30.278
- You okay?

50:30.487 --> 50:32.698
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

50:43.875 --> 50:45.752
- How is that possible?

50:53.093 --> 50:54.720
It's burning!

50:54.928 --> 50:56.596
Get this stuff off me!
- You're okay!

50:56.805 --> 50:59.182
No, you're okay!
- Where is he?

50:59.391 --> 51:03.311
Drive straight!

51:03.520 --> 51:05.397
- Where is he?
- Go left!

51:06.398 --> 51:07.190
- It's burning!

51:22.289 --> 51:25.751
- I think my leg is broken, my leg.

51:36.636 --> 51:37.971
- Victor?

51:38.180 --> 51:38.889
Victor.

51:40.640 --> 51:41.433
Victor!

51:43.018 --> 51:44.186
Oh god.

51:44.394 --> 51:45.103
Sofia?

51:46.146 --> 51:46.938
Sofia!

51:49.191 --> 51:51.485
- Amanda?
- Do you see him?

51:51.693 --> 51:54.988
- Amanda, I think my leg is broken.

51:55.197 --> 51:58.325
- Okay, okay, I'm coming.

52:00.577 --> 52:01.286
- My leg.

52:27.104 --> 52:28.730
- Amanda?

52:28.939 --> 52:30.649
Amanda, you all right?

52:32.317 --> 52:33.443
Amanda?

52:33.652 --> 52:34.361
- Hammett.

52:37.823 --> 52:42.786
Hammett.

52:44.121 --> 52:45.580
Hammett.

52:55.549 --> 52:56.466
Oh my god, no.

52:56.675 --> 52:58.385
No, no, no, no.

53:08.603 --> 53:09.729
Oh god this can't be happening.

53:09.938 --> 53:14.776
Get me out of here, please.

53:15.902 --> 53:17.362
No!

54:31.645 --> 54:33.021
Oh my.
- Hey, hey, it's okay.

54:33.230 --> 54:34.356
It's okay.
- He didn't see me.

54:34.564 --> 54:35.565
He didn't see me, it must've been the mud,

54:35.774 --> 54:38.068
he couldn't sense me.
- Where are the others?

54:38.276 --> 54:39.527
- They're dead.
- All right.

54:39.736 --> 54:41.613
Gotta catch up with Nick and
Andrei, it'll be all right.

55:15.647 --> 55:17.190
- What have I done?

55:30.036 --> 55:30.996
- Look, I don't know what's going on

55:31.204 --> 55:33.206
but Murdoch called me and
he said I should be here.

55:33.415 --> 55:35.041
I have no idea, why didn't
you call me earlier?

55:35.250 --> 55:37.794
- Do you think it's possible?
- Is what possible?

55:38.003 --> 55:39.504
- Amanda.
- What's going on?

55:41.214 --> 55:42.590
- Nothing.

55:42.799 --> 55:43.591
- Oh, really?

55:43.800 --> 55:45.927
Like you guys are here
discussing the weather?

55:46.136 --> 55:47.470
- You wanna give us a moment?

55:48.471 --> 55:49.222
- Gladly.

55:54.060 --> 55:54.769
- What?

55:54.978 --> 55:56.980
We were just discussing the possibilities

55:57.188 --> 55:58.982
of bringing this creature down.

55:59.190 --> 55:59.858
- Oh really?

56:00.066 --> 56:01.484
How come I don't believe you?

56:01.693 --> 56:02.819
- You don't even know me.

56:03.028 --> 56:04.154
- I've worked with Pinkus enough to know

56:04.362 --> 56:06.114
that he's always got an agenda.

56:06.323 --> 56:07.615
So when I see someone I don't trust

56:07.824 --> 56:09.284
talking to another person I don't trust

56:09.492 --> 56:11.494
I just don't get all
warm and fuzzy inside.

56:11.703 --> 56:14.122
- Well, that's where the
whiskey comes in, darlin'.

56:19.377 --> 56:21.004
- You two vipers can talk
business all you want,

56:21.212 --> 56:22.422
I'm gonna go call the Army.

56:23.340 --> 56:25.467
- Damn, you sure are hot
when you're making threats.

56:25.675 --> 56:26.676
- Oh I'm not making any threats,

56:26.885 --> 56:28.303
I'm gonna go call the Army right now.

56:28.511 --> 56:30.138
- She's hiding something big.

56:30.347 --> 56:32.140
- Yeah, the Army.
- What do you mean?

56:33.016 --> 56:34.851
- I'm not sure but she knows something.

56:35.894 --> 56:36.770
- A bluff, I don't think so.

56:36.978 --> 56:39.564
- I've got a bad feeling about her.

56:39.773 --> 56:41.816
- Let's find out what it is.
- Big, fancy PHD,

56:42.025 --> 56:43.109
but I do know one thing,

56:43.318 --> 56:44.861
there ain't a snake on this planet

56:45.070 --> 56:47.364
that can skewer people with its tail.

56:49.616 --> 56:51.326
- We weren't expecting this much trouble.

56:51.534 --> 56:53.328
- Really?
- What are you two discussing?

56:53.536 --> 56:54.746
- Yeah, Amanda, why don't you tell 'em,

56:54.954 --> 56:56.122
what were we discussing?

57:00.877 --> 57:02.045
- The serum.

57:02.253 --> 57:04.130
Okay, we gave it a serum.

57:04.339 --> 57:05.965
Sort of a DNA tune up.

57:06.174 --> 57:07.217
- Transgenics.

57:09.636 --> 57:10.637
- Snakes are the only animals

57:10.845 --> 57:12.931
that can tolerate the new serum,

57:13.139 --> 57:14.766
we had to find out why.

57:14.974 --> 57:16.518
So we altered its DNA

57:16.726 --> 57:18.436
in an attempt to isolate the gene

57:18.645 --> 57:20.063
that makes it immune to toxicity.

57:20.271 --> 57:22.649
- And the enormous size
of the spike in the tail

57:22.857 --> 57:24.442
is because of the drugs?

57:26.444 --> 57:27.529
- We believe the serum
is responsible, yes.

57:27.737 --> 57:29.239
- Well, well done, Doctor.

57:29.447 --> 57:31.366
- Do you think that I
intended for any of this?

57:31.574 --> 57:33.493
We were developing a drug
that would save lives.

57:33.701 --> 57:34.869
- Well saving lives, I
think you failed there.

57:35.078 --> 57:36.121
- No, no, no, no, no, we didn't fail,

57:36.329 --> 57:38.540
we were actually on the
cusp of a breakthrough.

57:41.334 --> 57:43.586
But there's a reason why I came along.

57:43.795 --> 57:45.296
- I don't like where this is going.

57:45.505 --> 57:47.382
- Don't know how it could get any worse.

57:48.800 --> 57:49.634
- She's pregnant.

57:52.011 --> 57:52.804
- I was wrong.

57:54.013 --> 57:55.640
- The female's about to give birth.

57:55.849 --> 57:56.558
- When?

57:57.892 --> 57:59.853
- In less than 24 hours, if not sooner.

58:00.854 --> 58:02.814
- Normal little snakes, right?

58:03.022 --> 58:04.149
- Like the black one.

58:04.357 --> 58:06.443
- Why the hell would you
allow something like that?

58:06.651 --> 58:08.361
- For research, the offspring would put us

58:08.570 --> 58:10.196
one step closer to perfecting the serum.

58:10.405 --> 58:13.116
- The serum, and just what
was this serum supposed to do

58:13.324 --> 58:14.409
besides wreak havoc?

58:14.617 --> 58:16.494
- A giant step towards the cure

58:16.703 --> 58:17.954
for cancer and Alzheimer's disease.

58:18.163 --> 58:20.290
- Well, giant's the operative
word here, that's for sure.

58:20.498 --> 58:22.250
- Okay, we can sit here
and argue about this

58:22.459 --> 58:23.084
or we can do something,

58:23.293 --> 58:24.419
because in less than 24 hours,

58:24.627 --> 58:26.045
this country's gonna be overrun.

58:26.254 --> 58:27.005
- Andrei, give me the sat phone--

58:27.213 --> 58:28.423
- Now, what are you doing?
- I'm calling the military.

58:28.631 --> 58:29.966
- Good call, Nick.
- You sure you wanna do that?

58:30.175 --> 58:32.010
- What else is there to do?
- Hold on a second,

58:32.218 --> 58:32.844
let's hear him out.

58:33.052 --> 58:34.762
- Our mission is based on secrecy, guys,

58:34.971 --> 58:35.847
you call in the military,

58:36.055 --> 58:37.432
we're kissing our paychecks goodbye.

58:37.640 --> 58:40.018
- There are thousands, no,
millions of lives at stake here.

58:40.226 --> 58:40.852
- Make that call, Nick.

58:41.060 --> 58:41.728
- You wanna go to jail, Sweetie?

58:41.936 --> 58:43.730
Last I heard, transgenics
were highly illegal.

58:43.938 --> 58:45.523
- Better 10 by 10 than six feet under.

58:45.732 --> 58:47.275
- She's right, we're not
equipped to deal with this

58:47.484 --> 58:49.235
and now we have no way
to find him in time.

58:49.444 --> 58:51.488
- I disagree, I think our
chances are excellent.

58:51.696 --> 58:52.739
I know where the snakes are.
- How?

58:52.947 --> 58:54.449
- I shot one with a tracker.

58:54.657 --> 58:55.700
One that can't be shed.

58:58.036 --> 58:58.828
Besides,

58:59.954 --> 59:01.581
you wanna call in the military?

59:01.789 --> 59:03.041
They won't be here in time.

59:12.967 --> 59:14.761
- You better be right.

59:36.115 --> 59:38.201
- Coffee?
- Sure, thanks.

59:40.954 --> 59:41.746
- Look,

59:43.206 --> 59:45.208
maybe we got off on the wrong foot.

59:46.501 --> 59:49.462
- Oh, I see, you've come
here to apologize, have you?

59:49.671 --> 59:50.922
No,

59:51.130 --> 59:53.967
actually I came here to offer you a job.

59:56.928 --> 01:00:00.348
- Well then I'd have to
question your intelligence.

01:00:00.557 --> 01:00:01.933
- Why is that?

01:00:02.141 --> 01:00:03.184
- 'Cause you're the great white hunter

01:00:03.393 --> 01:00:05.436
and I'm the one with the PHD, remember?

01:00:06.896 --> 01:00:07.689
- Oh.

01:00:08.982 --> 01:00:09.816
Wow.

01:00:13.403 --> 01:00:14.362
- I just hope that you're as good

01:00:14.571 --> 01:00:15.822
as everybody says you are.

01:00:18.992 --> 01:00:20.743
- No, I'm better.

01:00:43.266 --> 01:00:44.309
- Got it,

01:00:44.517 --> 01:00:45.852
the old industrial park.

01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:47.228
- Okay, let's go.

01:00:58.615 --> 01:00:59.324
You don't have to go in there.

01:00:59.532 --> 01:01:01.409
- One of us needs to stay
here, you good with that?

01:01:01.618 --> 01:01:02.243
- Sure.

01:01:02.452 --> 01:01:03.077
- We need you to be our eyes,

01:01:03.286 --> 01:01:05.163
if anything changes,
let us know immediately.

01:01:05.371 --> 01:01:06.080
- Got it.

01:02:17.235 --> 01:02:18.152
Straight ahead.

01:02:35.044 --> 01:02:37.088
- Pinkus?
- Yeah?

01:02:37.296 --> 01:02:38.923
- Stay back and cover us, huh?

01:02:40.675 --> 01:02:42.343
- Okay.

01:03:07.034 --> 01:03:08.536
- You're almost right on top of it.

01:03:16.919 --> 01:03:18.129
- Right.

01:03:18.337 --> 01:03:19.589
It's gotta be in here.

01:03:28.598 --> 01:03:30.391
- What now?

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:31.476
- I go high.

01:03:32.518 --> 01:03:33.936
- Low left.

01:03:34.145 --> 01:03:35.188
- Lower right.

01:03:36.689 --> 01:03:39.567
- One, two, three.

01:04:17.146 --> 01:04:17.897
Oh no.

01:04:20.733 --> 01:04:22.109
- Sofia.

01:04:44.590 --> 01:04:45.675
- Pinkus!

01:04:53.516 --> 01:04:54.809
Pinkus, hold on.

01:05:01.524 --> 01:05:03.359
- They're coming this way, I need backup.

01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:06.737
- Amanda spotted the snakes!

01:05:06.946 --> 01:05:07.947
We'll be right there!

01:05:08.155 --> 01:05:09.448
- Leave him, leave him,
there's nothing we can do,

01:05:09.657 --> 01:05:10.908
leave him!

01:05:15.955 --> 01:05:16.747
- Sorry.

01:05:21.335 --> 01:05:22.461
- I saw them go this way!

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.727
- Let me guess, they swim.

01:05:40.062 --> 01:05:41.522
- Unfortunately, very well.

01:05:42.773 --> 01:05:44.734
- This is where they went in.

01:05:44.942 --> 01:05:46.319
- What's the temperature of that water?

01:05:46.527 --> 01:05:48.154
- 40, maybe 50 degrees.

01:05:48.362 --> 01:05:49.113
- Well they're cold blooded

01:05:49.322 --> 01:05:52.074
so they can only last
like 20 or 30 minutes.

01:05:52.283 --> 01:05:54.285
- 30 minutes, seven miles an hour,

01:05:55.369 --> 01:05:56.996
puts 'em on that side of the lake.

01:05:57.204 --> 01:05:59.498
- They would swim until
they found a food source.

01:06:01.125 --> 01:06:02.668
Which means...

01:06:02.877 --> 01:06:03.586
- What?

01:06:04.879 --> 01:06:05.588
- She's about to give birth.

01:06:05.796 --> 01:06:07.048
- Oh god.
- What are you saying?

01:06:07.256 --> 01:06:08.257
- The anaconda lays their young

01:06:08.466 --> 01:06:10.593
next to an abundant food supply.

01:06:10.801 --> 01:06:11.510
- The city.

01:06:13.012 --> 01:06:13.763
- What do we do?

01:06:13.971 --> 01:06:15.556
- Find out where they went
ashore and we keep tracking.

01:06:15.765 --> 01:06:17.224
- Keep tracking them, are you nuts?

01:06:17.433 --> 01:06:19.185
Half our crew is dead and if we'd called

01:06:19.393 --> 01:06:21.687
like Amanda wanted maybe--
- Nobody wanted this, man.

01:06:21.896 --> 01:06:23.064
Let me tell you a little
bit about the military

01:06:23.272 --> 01:06:24.857
in this country, they're about as reliable

01:06:25.066 --> 01:06:26.692
as a bottle of Jack at an AA meeting.

01:06:26.901 --> 01:06:27.777
- You are full of it,

01:06:27.985 --> 01:06:29.570
you've done nothing but get us killed.

01:06:29.779 --> 01:06:32.281
- Let me paint you a clearer picture.

01:06:32.490 --> 01:06:34.158
In about 12 hours, this entire country

01:06:34.367 --> 01:06:35.993
is gonna be overrun with baby snakes

01:06:36.202 --> 01:06:38.287
that will eat you and
everything in their path,

01:06:38.496 --> 01:06:40.957
now we can either find them and stop them

01:06:41.165 --> 01:06:42.708
or we can call in the military.

01:06:42.917 --> 01:06:43.626
- Call 'em already!

01:06:43.834 --> 01:06:45.294
- Andrei, give me the sat phone!

01:06:49.131 --> 01:06:51.676
Yeah, it's Hammett, put me
through to Major Reisner.

01:06:53.386 --> 01:06:55.638
Major, a situation has arisen

01:06:55.846 --> 01:06:57.974
that requires your urgent assistance.

01:06:58.182 --> 01:07:01.394
A 100 foot mutated anaconda
has escaped a confined facility

01:07:01.602 --> 01:07:04.105
near Biaton, we've been
tracking it for two days,

01:07:04.313 --> 01:07:05.314
we've already lost five men.

01:07:05.523 --> 01:07:08.150
Now our concern is for the local citizens.

01:07:08.359 --> 01:07:10.444
We need backup ASAP.

01:07:14.156 --> 01:07:15.783
Thank you, I'll alert my team.

01:07:15.992 --> 01:07:18.619
I'll keep the sat phone on
to triangulate our position.

01:07:19.578 --> 01:07:20.579
Andrei, keep it on!

01:07:21.622 --> 01:07:22.748
Everyone happy?

01:07:24.417 --> 01:07:26.419
Now you got two choices.

01:07:26.627 --> 01:07:28.921
You go home with a great snake story

01:07:29.130 --> 01:07:30.006
or you go with me.

01:07:31.257 --> 01:07:32.800
I intend on getting a nice new pair

01:07:33.009 --> 01:07:35.136
of anaconda snakeskin
boots in the morning.

01:07:54.113 --> 01:07:57.074
- Five more minutes, honey,
your father will be home soon.

01:08:14.508 --> 01:08:15.968
- I got ya.

01:08:16.176 --> 01:08:16.969
- What do you see?

01:08:17.178 --> 01:08:18.929
- The natural patterns in the bushes,

01:08:19.138 --> 01:08:22.308
patterns in the dirt, every
animal's got its stamp,

01:08:22.515 --> 01:08:24.602
you just gotta know how to find 'em.

01:08:24.810 --> 01:08:25.519
Call the others!

01:08:29.732 --> 01:08:31.358
- Hammett's found the trail.

01:08:31.567 --> 01:08:33.359
We're heading northwest.

01:08:33.569 --> 01:08:36.322
Our coordinates are 34982 by 45093, over.

01:08:39.116 --> 01:08:40.326
- We're heading west now.

01:08:41.952 --> 01:08:44.330
We should intersect on Farrigo Road

01:08:44.537 --> 01:08:47.541
about 2.1 kilometers from your location,

01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:50.169
assuming that you stay on that heading.

01:08:50.377 --> 01:08:52.421
- Sounds right, out.

01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:53.756
- Okay, turn here.

01:08:59.386 --> 01:09:00.095
Take the left fork.

01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:08.938
What?

01:09:12.358 --> 01:09:13.442
- We're less than a quarter mile

01:09:13.651 --> 01:09:14.734
from our rendezvous, right?

01:09:14.944 --> 01:09:15.569
- Yeah, that's right.

01:09:15.778 --> 01:09:17.404
- We have 20 minutes 'til they get here.

01:09:17.613 --> 01:09:18.363
- What are you getting at?

01:09:18.572 --> 01:09:19.990
- That factory has
everything a giant snake

01:09:20.198 --> 01:09:21.158
would want in a home.

01:09:22.618 --> 01:09:24.411
We have the weapons
and the time, let's go.

01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:25.912
- Yeah, I'm with you.

01:09:34.087 --> 01:09:35.131
- What is it?

01:09:36.298 --> 01:09:38.216
- The trail just disappeared.

01:09:38.425 --> 01:09:40.301
- It can't just disappear.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

01:09:40.511 --> 01:09:41.804
It's gotta be here somewhere.

01:09:43.848 --> 01:09:44.640
The trees.

01:09:46.225 --> 01:09:49.937
Look out!

01:09:55.234 --> 01:09:56.026
You okay?
- Yeah.

01:09:56.235 --> 01:09:58.779
But I think God wants us to fail.

01:09:58.988 --> 01:10:01.407
- Not just yet, pal, not just yet.

01:10:01.615 --> 01:10:03.159
- Oh you've got to be kidding me.

01:10:05.828 --> 01:10:08.622
- Well, at least we
established a rendezvous.

01:10:08.831 --> 01:10:10.207
Let's get the hell outta here.

01:10:11.584 --> 01:10:12.668
- Take a look at this.

01:10:15.296 --> 01:10:16.755
- Well if there's blood,
there's more blood.

01:10:18.966 --> 01:10:19.758
Let's find it.

01:10:22.761 --> 01:10:23.512
Bingo.

01:10:26.015 --> 01:10:28.684
That snake just made our
job a hell of a lot easier.

01:10:28.893 --> 01:10:29.602
Let's go.

01:10:38.819 --> 01:10:40.321
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

01:10:40.529 --> 01:10:41.655
Andrei, we got a visual on the snake,

01:10:41.864 --> 01:10:43.115
20 degrees west of your location,

01:10:43.324 --> 01:10:44.491
the old abandoned power plant, over.

01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:45.659
- Try him again.

01:10:45.868 --> 01:10:47.286
- Andrei, do you copy?

01:10:47.494 --> 01:10:48.245
- I guess we're on our own.

01:10:48.454 --> 01:10:49.997
- Great, give me the biggest gun you have.

01:10:51.498 --> 01:10:52.208
- How cute.

01:10:52.416 --> 01:10:54.043
- Just kidding.
- This big enough for you?

01:10:54.251 --> 01:10:55.628
- Let's go.
- Gonna have to do for now.

01:11:30.996 --> 01:11:32.665
- We're clear.

01:11:34.917 --> 01:11:35.834
You ready for this?

01:11:36.794 --> 01:11:37.836
- Not even remotely.

01:11:39.213 --> 01:11:40.005
- Atta girl.

01:11:57.898 --> 01:11:58.983
Nice apartment.

01:12:06.907 --> 01:12:08.742
- You saw it come in here, right?

01:12:08.951 --> 01:12:11.578
- It would've been hard to miss.

01:13:33.744 --> 01:13:35.162
This must be the guest room.

01:13:35.371 --> 01:13:36.080
- Yeah.

01:13:40.334 --> 01:13:41.752
I say we go over there.

01:13:42.669 --> 01:13:43.462
- Okay.

01:14:04.274 --> 01:14:06.026
- The blood here's the
snake's blood, right here.

01:14:06.235 --> 01:14:06.944
- Yeah.

01:14:09.947 --> 01:14:11.490
That makes me feel a lot better.

01:14:20.457 --> 01:14:23.335
- There's more right here.

01:15:20.851 --> 01:15:22.394
- Hold on, hold on.

01:15:35.741 --> 01:15:36.450
Clear.

01:15:50.339 --> 01:15:51.131
Clear.

01:16:12.736 --> 01:16:14.112
You got my back?

01:16:14.321 --> 01:16:15.197
- I got your back.

01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:49.856
- They're playing hide and seek.

01:16:50.065 --> 01:16:51.275
Watch out!

01:16:53.193 --> 01:16:53.902
Oh god!

01:17:03.203 --> 01:17:04.329
It's only rats.

01:17:04.538 --> 01:17:06.039
- Just snake snacks.

01:17:24.683 --> 01:17:25.475
- Hammett!

01:17:28.145 --> 01:17:29.229
- That's it.

01:17:29.438 --> 01:17:30.897
All right, keep up.

01:17:46.455 --> 01:17:48.540
- Where'd he go?

01:17:52.002 --> 01:17:53.211
- No!

01:17:54.713 --> 01:17:55.797
Wait, stop it!

01:17:56.006 --> 01:18:00.886
No, no, no!

01:18:04.431 --> 01:18:05.140
- Help me.

01:18:08.602 --> 01:18:10.979
Damn it, Amanda, take me out!

01:18:15.108 --> 01:18:17.027
- What are you doing?

01:18:17.235 --> 01:18:19.196
Nick, no!

01:18:19.404 --> 01:18:20.030
What are you doing?

01:18:20.238 --> 01:18:21.406
No!

01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:27.621
No!

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:33.168
What do I do?

01:18:33.377 --> 01:18:34.086
- Run!

01:18:44.096 --> 01:18:44.888
- Hurry!

01:19:27.806 --> 01:19:29.683
Give me the sat phone.
- Why are we stopping?

01:19:29.891 --> 01:19:30.809
We have to help them.
- You go on ahead,

01:19:31.017 --> 01:19:31.935
I wanna check backup.

01:19:33.603 --> 01:19:35.897
We're four miles
northeast of the location.

01:19:36.106 --> 01:19:38.692
The old power plant, you can't miss it.

01:19:44.948 --> 01:19:46.950
- Murdoch residence.
- It's Mr. Reisner,

01:19:47.159 --> 01:19:48.660
please, put me through to Murdoch.

01:19:48.869 --> 01:19:50.537
- Just a second, sir.

01:19:50.746 --> 01:19:53.206
Mr. Murdoch, Mr. Reisner on line for you.

01:19:54.332 --> 01:19:57.127
- Tell him I'll call
him back on the other line.

01:19:57.335 --> 01:19:58.420
- Yes sir.

01:20:05.635 --> 01:20:08.847
- I told you not to call me
on any line but this one.

01:20:09.055 --> 01:20:10.891
- Sorry, it won't happen again.

01:20:11.099 --> 01:20:12.309
I wanted to let you know that everything

01:20:12.517 --> 01:20:15.270
is going as planned,
we're right on schedule.

01:20:15.479 --> 01:20:16.938
- Good.

01:20:17.147 --> 01:20:19.316
No one must know anything about this.

01:20:19.524 --> 01:20:20.817
- That won't be a problem,

01:20:21.026 --> 01:20:23.111
just make sure our money is in place.

01:20:44.466 --> 01:20:45.675
- Oh my god, I thought you guys were dead.

01:20:45.884 --> 01:20:47.761
- Our radio was broken.
- Where's Nick?

01:20:47.969 --> 01:20:49.346
- He's dead and so is the black one.

01:20:49.554 --> 01:20:51.181
- The queen?
- I think it's down that hall.

01:20:51.389 --> 01:20:53.016
- What's this?

01:20:53.225 --> 01:20:54.059
- It's a slug.
- A what?

01:20:54.267 --> 01:20:55.477
- An infertile
membrane, a dead egg.

01:20:55.685 --> 01:20:56.311
- What does it mean?

01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:57.145
- It means she's about to
start laying any minute.

01:20:57.354 --> 01:20:59.231
- Then let's finish this
and get the hell outta here!

01:21:06.988 --> 01:21:09.366
- 60 seconds will give us enough time.

01:21:09.574 --> 01:21:11.535
We'll blow this whole place.

01:21:19.292 --> 01:21:20.669
- What the hell, Hammett?

01:21:20.877 --> 01:21:22.420
- Quite a sight, isn't it?

01:21:22.629 --> 01:21:24.005
The miracle of birth.

01:21:24.214 --> 01:21:26.925
I can't believe you wanna
destroy something so beautiful.

01:21:28.009 --> 01:21:30.262
Ah ah ah, toss the gun down, soldier girl.

01:21:33.765 --> 01:21:36.726
What, you don't think I'd shoot you?

01:21:39.896 --> 01:21:40.772
Good girl.

01:21:40.981 --> 01:21:42.941
- You have no idea what
you're doing, Hammett.

01:21:43.149 --> 01:21:44.401
- I think I do.

01:21:44.609 --> 01:21:47.445
10 million dollars for
just one baby snake.

01:21:48.488 --> 01:21:50.156
- Let me guess, you're
working with Murdoch.

01:21:50.365 --> 01:21:52.576
- You are not a doctor for nothing.

01:21:53.785 --> 01:21:55.829
- There's no special
forces unit, is there?

01:21:56.037 --> 01:21:57.414
- Two for two.

01:21:57.622 --> 01:21:59.416
- Why don't you just shoot me?

01:21:59.624 --> 01:22:03.169
- Well, you could be a meal
or you could take a bullet

01:22:03.378 --> 01:22:06.798
and be a meal or you could
work for a brand new employer

01:22:07.799 --> 01:22:09.718
who could use some of your expertise

01:22:09.926 --> 01:22:11.136
and continue your research.

01:22:18.018 --> 01:22:19.477
- Cut me in on the 10 million?

01:22:22.814 --> 01:22:23.607
- Negotiable.

01:22:25.775 --> 01:22:26.568
- Okay.

01:22:30.822 --> 01:22:32.157
- Okay.

01:22:32.365 --> 01:22:33.116
- Not!

01:22:43.376 --> 01:22:45.086
- So, you wanna play?

01:23:10.487 --> 01:23:12.697
I'm trying to be nice here.

01:24:01.162 --> 01:24:03.832
- Happy trails, slimy bitch!

01:24:10.588 --> 01:24:13.258
Your 10 mil's about to
go up in flames, Hammett!

01:24:15.093 --> 01:24:17.137
Hope that's not the only thing.

01:24:20.432 --> 01:24:21.725
Good knowing you.

01:26:18.174 --> 01:26:19.008
- Reisner?

01:26:19.217 --> 01:26:20.552
You have a package for me?

01:26:22.428 --> 01:26:23.680
- Yes, Mr. Murdoch, I have one.

01:26:23.888 --> 01:26:25.682
I will begin research immediately.

01:26:25.890 --> 01:26:27.934
- You show me proof,
the money will be wired

01:26:28.143 --> 01:26:29.936
direct to your account.
