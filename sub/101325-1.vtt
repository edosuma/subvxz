00:00.560 --> 00:03.960
Open the fucking door. Come on, let's go.

00:11.280 --> 00:14.320
Damn, open the door right now.
Open the fucking door.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.320
What do you want?

00:20.960 --> 00:22.640
Come on. I know somebody's out there.

00:22.720 --> 00:23.720
Open up.

00:27.040 --> 00:30.200
<i>I'm Detective Edward Robert Sutton.</i>

00:30.280 --> 00:31.760
What do you want?

00:31.840 --> 00:33.280
<i>I'm a police officer.</i>

00:34.680 --> 00:36.880
<i>My badge number is 5149.</i>

00:40.000 --> 00:43.680
<i>I've served with honour,
valour, and integrity.</i>

00:45.280 --> 00:48.680
<i>I've served with distinction
all my career.</i>

00:50.640 --> 00:55.200
<i>I'm a police officer at heart
and I always will be.</i>

00:57.560 --> 01:02.680
<i>I will tell you exactly what happened,
the events in the order they occurred.</i>

01:04.000 --> 01:05.760
<i>You can put the pieces together.</i>

01:06.640 --> 01:08.960
<i>This is my story, and I stand by it.</i>

01:41.160 --> 01:42.680
<i>All units. I repeat, all units.</i>

01:42.760 --> 01:44.920
<i>Suspected kidnapping at 312 Oakford Road.</i>

02:01.680 --> 02:04.960
This is unit 1276,
we're a few blocks away.

02:16.480 --> 02:18.320
<i>1276.
Suspect is a white male.</i>

02:18.400 --> 02:20.160
<i>He's considered armed and dangerous.</i>

02:20.840 --> 02:23.040
<i>I repeat, the suspect
is considered armed and dangerous.</i>

02:23.120 --> 02:24.120
<i>Proceed with caution.</i>

02:33.960 --> 02:35.520
Copy that.

02:35.600 --> 02:37.160
10-4. We're on it.

03:59.560 --> 04:00.960
<i>I miss active duty.</i>

04:04.200 --> 04:07.400
<i>I made my mark. I did my job.</i>

04:13.120 --> 04:16.120
<i>I was one of the guys.
I took pride in my work.</i>

04:23.080 --> 04:25.320
<i>I'm on medical leave.</i>

04:33.120 --> 04:36.920
<i>Since I had the leg injury,
I've been taking painkillers.</i>

04:41.880 --> 04:44.240
<i>The downside is, they're addictive.</i>

05:10.920 --> 05:13.040
- <i>Rose speaking.</i>
- Hi, it's me.

05:13.120 --> 05:14.800
What's going on? Where are you?

05:14.880 --> 05:19.400
<i>Oh, I'm stuck in traffic, again.</i>

05:19.480 --> 05:21.680
Uh, listen, is there any leftovers
from yesterday?

05:22.360 --> 05:26.400
- <i>I think I put them in the fridge.</i>
- No, I looked. There's nothing there.

05:26.920 --> 05:28.760
<i>Uh, perhaps I threw it away.</i>

05:28.840 --> 05:30.600
<i>After all, I made it three days ago.</i>

05:31.480 --> 05:34.160
Okay then, um, I guess I'll make
something for us both.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.640
- Drive safe.
<i>- Okay, see you soon, honey.</i>

05:46.360 --> 05:48.080
<i>I don't know what I'd do
without her.</i>

05:51.240 --> 05:53.040
<i>She's always by my side.</i>

06:08.120 --> 06:11.680
<i>That night, I was watching the news.</i>

06:12.440 --> 06:15.560
<i>I'm pretty sure it was the first time
I heard about the missing girl.</i>

06:17.040 --> 06:19.920
<i>I had no idea her case would come
so close to home.</i>

06:21.760 --> 06:23.520
<i>…they're keeping him alive.</i>

06:23.600 --> 06:26.000
<i>In the meantime,
we want to get to some new information</i>

06:26.080 --> 06:29.520
<i>out of the state of Illinois
as authorities are hunting for a kidnapper</i>

06:29.600 --> 06:32.200
<i>they believe
has been kidnapping young girls for years.</i>

06:32.280 --> 06:34.080
<i>Today's victim is Lisa Coleman</i>

06:34.160 --> 06:36.880
<i>who has been seen taken
near her home at Oakford Road.</i>

06:36.960 --> 06:39.880
<i>The kidnapped girl's father, Richard,
works at night for a ministry</i>

06:39.960 --> 06:41.680
<i>and went to a gym the next morning.</i>

06:41.760 --> 06:44.880
<i>From there, he called Lisa
who said that the man was following her.</i>

06:44.960 --> 06:47.920
<i>By the time Richard had returned
to the house, she was missing.</i>

06:48.000 --> 06:49.680
<i>Let's hope she's well
and we will come back</i>

06:49.760 --> 06:51.760
<i>with more news about this in a minute.</i>

06:51.840 --> 06:54.680
<i>Now, to a warning
for a storm that will soon reach Illinois.</i>

06:54.760 --> 06:57.840
<i>Meteorologists strongly recommend people
stay inside their homes</i>

06:57.920 --> 07:00.760
<i>and be prepared for power outages
in the coming days…</i>

07:40.440 --> 07:42.240
<i>Open the fucking door!</i>

08:38.919 --> 08:39.919
Rose.

08:44.960 --> 08:45.960
Rose?

08:51.880 --> 08:52.880
Rose?

08:57.240 --> 08:58.400
Hello?

09:10.560 --> 09:12.040
<i>Hi, you've reached Rose.</i>

09:12.120 --> 09:14.560
<i>Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you soon.</i>

09:16.480 --> 09:17.480
Where are you?

09:19.480 --> 09:21.600
Is everything okay? I waited all night.

09:25.640 --> 09:27.480
Rose, I need you to call me right away.

09:43.480 --> 09:45.720
<i>I was just roaming around
through the apartment</i>

09:45.800 --> 09:49.080
<i>when I came upon some old case files.</i>

09:53.840 --> 09:57.520
<i>They reminded me
of my partner, Paul Brenner.</i>

10:06.280 --> 10:07.280
Rose?

10:11.880 --> 10:14.960
Rose, if that's you, please talk to me.
What's going on?

10:19.000 --> 10:24.920
Rose, I'm worried about you.

10:39.240 --> 10:41.560
<i>Hi, you've reached Rose.
Please leave a message.</i>

10:50.160 --> 10:51.400
<i>Well, of course I was worried.</i>

10:51.480 --> 10:53.880
<i>But she'd been away
on longer trips before.</i>

11:00.720 --> 11:03.280
<i>I didn't have a reason
to call it in.</i>

11:03.360 --> 11:04.720
<i>She was on her way home.</i>

11:07.160 --> 11:08.160
<i>You know…</i>

11:09.720 --> 11:12.400
<i>I've spent most of my career
preparing for the worst.</i>

11:13.520 --> 11:14.520
<i>On the job.</i>

11:16.040 --> 11:17.400
<i>Day in and day out.</i>

11:18.280 --> 11:21.080
<i>Different case scenarios
playing out in my mind.</i>

11:21.840 --> 11:22.840
<i>What if…</i>

11:25.120 --> 11:28.960
<i>I had no reason to worry about her.
I knew she was okay.</i>

11:31.760 --> 11:35.960
<i>I just needed something
to keep my mind off things for a while.</i>

11:58.680 --> 12:00.880
Hey, you, knock it off up there.

12:49.720 --> 12:52.000
<i>Desk work is my least favourite.</i>

12:54.720 --> 12:56.120
<i>I belong in the field.</i>

12:57.320 --> 13:00.080
<i>First officer on the scene,
that's where I belong.</i>

13:22.160 --> 13:25.880
Hey, anybody down here?

13:47.920 --> 13:49.440
<i>I remember the smell.</i>

13:50.560 --> 13:55.560
<i>It wasn't just the pathogenic spores
you would expect.</i>

13:55.640 --> 13:57.080
<i>There was something else as well.</i>

14:23.720 --> 14:27.360
<i>I've been on the force
as long as I can remember.</i>

14:29.280 --> 14:31.760
<i>I started out years ago.</i>

14:33.800 --> 14:38.080
<i>I had my field training
and I quickly moved up the ranks.</i>

14:39.400 --> 14:43.240
<i>Homicide, missing persons,
aggravated assault, domestic violence.</i>

14:43.320 --> 14:44.320
<i>You name it.</i>

14:46.280 --> 14:48.440
<i>I've seen some bad shit going down.</i>

15:05.680 --> 15:08.160
<i>No signs of a struggle, nothing.</i>

15:09.000 --> 15:10.440
<i>No hard evidence.</i>

15:15.760 --> 15:20.920
<i>I still had a gut feeling
something was wrong.</i>

15:21.800 --> 15:23.200
<i>Terribly wrong.</i>

16:59.040 --> 17:00.040
Shit.

17:11.720 --> 17:13.800
<i>♪ Would you ever ♪</i>

17:15.800 --> 17:18.680
<i>♪ Take a look at my forms? ♪</i>

17:21.800 --> 17:26.200

What the fuck is with this? Come on.

19:27.280 --> 19:28.280
Ugh.

20:03.680 --> 20:06.560
Ugh. Holy fuck.

20:21.800 --> 20:22.800
Whew.

20:29.160 --> 20:30.160
Rose?

20:30.640 --> 20:31.640
<i>Hi, honey.</i>

20:32.320 --> 20:33.760
Ugh. What's going on?

20:34.560 --> 20:36.240
Please tell me you're okay.

20:36.320 --> 20:39.320
<i>I'm fine.
The phone died, so I couldn't call you.</i>

20:40.160 --> 20:42.880
W-What happened yesterday?
I was worried sick about you.

20:42.960 --> 20:43.960
<i>I couldn't drive home.</i>

20:44.040 --> 20:45.920
<i>They closed down the road
because of the storm.</i>

20:46.000 --> 20:49.160
- Where are you now?
- <i>I'm staying at the motel near the lake.</i>

20:49.240 --> 20:51.600
<i>Same place we rented canoes
last summer, remember?</i>

20:52.560 --> 20:53.920
Okay, that's good.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.280
<i>I have to go now.
See you tomorrow, honey.</i>

21:06.640 --> 21:10.800
<i>My strong point
is paying attention to detail.</i>

21:12.520 --> 21:14.360
<i>In this line of work, you have to.</i>

21:18.040 --> 21:23.800
<i>There's a certain satisfaction
that comes from solving a complex case.</i>

21:27.080 --> 21:30.520
<i>Much like putting together
a difficult puzzle.</i>

21:37.320 --> 21:40.200
Edward?

21:40.280 --> 21:42.720
Edward!

21:44.400 --> 21:47.160
- Edward Sutton!
- Yeah?

21:47.240 --> 21:50.360
What are you doing in there?
Keep it down, will you?

21:50.440 --> 21:52.520
What? What are you talking about?

21:52.600 --> 21:55.120
If I get any more complaints,
you'll be evicted.

21:55.760 --> 21:58.960
Don't you have anything better to do?
Mind your own business.

21:59.040 --> 22:03.200
By the way, the neighbours saw you
carrying a bunch of carpets last week.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.880
You know you're not allowed
to change anything, right?

22:06.640 --> 22:08.640
Don't be telling me what to do
in my own apartment.

22:08.720 --> 22:11.360
Don't forget it's my apartment,
not yours.

22:12.440 --> 22:14.400
Fuck you!

22:14.480 --> 22:17.160
I'm gonna charge you for everything
you wreck in there.

22:17.240 --> 22:18.240
You hear me?

22:19.160 --> 22:22.800
It's my apartment.
I know my rights, so fuck off.

22:22.880 --> 22:25.600
I'll make this hell for you.
Just you wait and see.

22:25.680 --> 22:28.680
What's that, are you threatening me?
You know I'm a cop, right?

22:28.760 --> 22:32.280
Just keep it down, Edward.
Keep it down!

22:33.280 --> 22:35.680
Nobody should have to pay
for this shithole anyways.

23:02.080 --> 23:03.480
<i>I felt a presence.</i>

23:07.840 --> 23:09.720
<i>Someone else was down there.</i>

24:37.520 --> 24:40.760
<i>The first officer at the scene
needs to protect the crime scene.</i>

24:44.760 --> 24:47.680
<i>Evidence has to be kept uncontaminated.</i>

24:56.440 --> 25:00.760
<i>If a case is not in progress,
the case will be assigned to a detective.</i>

25:07.640 --> 25:09.720
<i>The detective will collect
forensic evidence,</i>

25:09.800 --> 25:13.000
<i>like fingerprints, blood, or saliva.</i>

25:17.480 --> 25:18.480
Hmm <i>…</i>

26:31.480 --> 26:32.480
Hey, stop.

26:33.120 --> 26:34.120
Stop!

26:44.360 --> 26:45.360
Where did you go?

26:48.080 --> 26:49.160
Fuck!

27:03.320 --> 27:05.136
Stillwater Police Department.
How can I help you?

27:05.160 --> 27:06.160
Anne!

27:07.040 --> 27:08.520
Paul Brenner, please.

27:08.600 --> 27:10.960
<i>Hey, Eddie. I'm connecting you now.</i>

27:13.400 --> 27:16.400
- <i>Investigator Paul Brenner speaking.</i>
- It's me, Edward.

27:16.480 --> 27:17.720
<i>Eddie, how are you?</i>

27:18.720 --> 27:19.840
I'm alright.

27:19.920 --> 27:22.680
<i>How's that chest pain
and that leg of yours?</i>

27:22.760 --> 27:23.800
Yeah, it's the same.

27:23.880 --> 27:25.840
<i>So what's going on, Eddie?</i>

27:28.040 --> 27:29.040
It's weird.

27:29.640 --> 27:30.720
<i>What do you mean weird?</i>

27:31.280 --> 27:34.280
Well, there's some strange noises
from the basement.

27:34.360 --> 27:35.760
Bloodstains, and <i>…</i>

27:35.840 --> 27:37.520
somebody actually attacked me.

27:37.600 --> 27:39.080
<i>Eddie, are you alright?</i>

27:40.680 --> 27:42.720
Listen, I-I'm thinking
maybe you can help me.

27:43.320 --> 27:45.040
<i>You've been acting
kind of strange lately.</i>

27:45.120 --> 27:46.736
<i>You know how those painkillers
mess you up.</i>

27:46.760 --> 27:48.600
- Yeah, but Paul…
<i>- Just try to get some sleep.</i>

27:48.640 --> 27:49.640
<i>I have to go now.</i>

27:56.480 --> 27:59.440
<i>It was becoming
more and more apparent to me</i>

28:00.280 --> 28:02.760
<i>that someone was trying to frame me.</i>

28:04.840 --> 28:07.360
<i>But I couldn't figure out
who would have a motive.</i>

28:13.760 --> 28:15.520
<i>It just didn't make sense to me.</i>

28:16.520 --> 28:18.800
<i>Who in their right frame of mind</i>

28:18.880 --> 28:21.760
<i>would've gone through all this trouble
to set me up?</i>

28:28.840 --> 28:29.840
<i>Eddie?</i>

28:30.280 --> 28:32.000
Rose, is that you?

28:32.720 --> 28:34.040
<i>Yes, who would it be?</i>

28:34.640 --> 28:35.760
<i>You sound strange.</i>

28:36.760 --> 28:39.720
It's nothing, I'm <i>…</i> I'm not feeling well.

28:39.800 --> 28:42.120
<i>What is it this time?
Is something wrong?</i>

28:42.200 --> 28:43.200
No, I <i>…</i>

28:43.640 --> 28:46.400
- When are you coming home?
<i>- Oh, I don't know.</i>

28:47.000 --> 28:48.720
<i>If I'm lucky, I'll be home by tonight.</i>

28:50.760 --> 28:51.920
I really miss you.

28:54.480 --> 28:55.480
Rose?

28:56.240 --> 29:00.280
Rose?

29:04.200 --> 29:05.680
- Rose?
<i>- Help.</i>

29:05.760 --> 29:08.600
- Is that you, Rose?
<i>- Please help me.</i>

29:08.680 --> 29:09.680
Who is this?

29:10.120 --> 29:13.480
<i>M</i>-<i>My name is Lisa,</i>
<i>and I</i>-<i>I can't see, I'm tied up.</i>

29:13.560 --> 29:16.080
What? Tied up? How did you get my number?

29:16.160 --> 29:20.360
<i>Uh, I just woke up
and I found this phone.</i>

29:20.440 --> 29:22.800
<i>I pushed redial.</i>

29:22.880 --> 29:24.960
Okay, listen, Lisa, I can help you.

29:25.040 --> 29:27.920
W-What does it look like in there?
Do you have any clues?

29:28.000 --> 29:29.400
<i>I</i>-<i>I can't see.</i>

29:30.040 --> 29:31.520
<i>It's</i>-<i>It's pitch black.</i>

29:31.600 --> 29:35.200
Okay, listen, calm down.
I'm a detective. I'm gonna help you here.

29:35.280 --> 29:36.720
<i>Please. Hurry.</i>

29:36.800 --> 29:38.480
I-Is someone near you?

29:38.560 --> 29:40.840
<i>No, I</i>-<i>I can't hear him.</i>

29:40.920 --> 29:43.840
<i>But he</i>-<i>he could be back any second.</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

29:43.920 --> 29:46.040
Try to remember,
who could have done this to you?

29:46.120 --> 29:47.680
Where could they have taken you?

29:48.200 --> 29:52.560
<i>I</i>-<i>I remember a face, and I was</i>
<i>thrown into a car and taken away.</i>

29:54.400 --> 29:57.400
Okay, where was the last place you were
before they took you?

29:57.960 --> 29:59.440
<i>Uh, I was…</i>

30:19.240 --> 30:22.760
Let me go!

30:36.440 --> 30:37.440
Lisa.

30:37.840 --> 30:38.920
Lisa, are you there?

30:39.800 --> 30:41.680
Thank god. Get me out of here.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.320
- Just stand back.
- Please, hurry.

30:50.080 --> 30:51.080
Hang on.

30:57.080 --> 30:58.200
Lisa.

31:00.320 --> 31:01.320
I can't breathe.

31:02.320 --> 31:05.440
Hang on, hang on.

31:10.280 --> 31:11.400
Hang on, come on.

31:13.360 --> 31:16.120
Lisa!

31:25.080 --> 31:26.800
<i>♪ The sky is no longer the limit ♪</i>

31:39.000 --> 31:41.120
No, stop! Stop, Lisa!

31:41.200 --> 31:43.880
Five, four...
Five, four, nine, nine, six, eight, one.

31:43.960 --> 31:45.920
Five, four, nine, nine, six, eight, one.

31:49.480 --> 31:51.320
Five, four, nine, nine, six, eight, one.

31:53.800 --> 31:55.160
Five, four…

31:56.760 --> 31:57.960
…eight, one.

32:08.040 --> 32:09.800
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

32:09.880 --> 32:12.640
This is Edward Sutton.
There's been a kidnapping.

32:13.280 --> 32:17.680
Send somebody around to my house
right away, 237 East Mulberry Street.

32:18.280 --> 32:21.160
<i>We'll send someone over right
away, sir. What did you see?</i>

32:21.240 --> 32:24.160
The missing girl, Lisa Coleman.
From the news.

32:24.240 --> 32:29.000
They took her away in a car.
The license plate is 5499681.

32:30.120 --> 32:31.120
Please hurry.

32:47.120 --> 32:48.280
What's happening?

33:40.440 --> 33:42.000
<i>The police never arrived.</i>

33:43.160 --> 33:44.160
<i>Where were they?</i>

33:45.920 --> 33:47.240
Where are those guys?

34:05.600 --> 34:08.239
<i>Of course he would return
to the scene.</i>

34:08.320 --> 34:10.120
<i>He'd left too much evidence.</i>

34:10.760 --> 34:13.639
<i>He would come back
and try and cover his tracks.</i>

34:14.280 --> 34:15.480
<i>Clean up his mess.</i>

34:26.080 --> 34:27.239
<i>It was protocol.</i>

34:28.400 --> 34:31.719
<i>Protecting the scene
while waiting for backup.</i>

34:32.760 --> 34:35.560
<i>It's standard operating procedure.</i>

35:14.000 --> 35:16.360
<i>All criminals make mistakes.</i>

35:17.480 --> 35:21.200
<i>His biggest mistake
was playing games on my turf.</i>

36:07.440 --> 36:08.880
Hey... Ow!

36:45.360 --> 36:48.240
Ugh.

36:55.880 --> 36:56.920
Come on.

36:59.920 --> 37:01.600
Where are you at, motherfucker?

37:06.320 --> 37:07.400
Where are you hiding?

38:15.920 --> 38:19.040
Fuck.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.160
<i>You have reached
Stillwater Police Department.</i>

38:23.240 --> 38:26.840
<i>We are not in right now.
Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

38:28.240 --> 38:32.680
Anne, there's been a kidnapping.
Please send troopers to my place.

38:32.760 --> 38:34.920
237 East Mulberry Street.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.440
I called 911, but they never showed up.

38:37.520 --> 38:40.520
It's the missing girl from the news,
Lisa Coleman.

38:40.600 --> 38:42.040
They took her away in a car.

38:42.120 --> 38:48.800
Check out the license of, uh, 5499681.

38:48.880 --> 38:50.880
Please hurry.

39:05.800 --> 39:07.600
<i>Ahh!</i>

39:11.080 --> 39:12.160
Who are you?

40:02.520 --> 40:05.800
What the fuck is that?

40:08.200 --> 40:09.920
It just doesn't make sense.

40:24.720 --> 40:26.720
Hey!

40:32.560 --> 40:34.880
What are you doing?

40:37.400 --> 40:38.560
Open the door.

40:42.320 --> 40:43.320
Hello?

40:47.920 --> 40:50.960
Open the fucking door. Come on, let's go!

40:58.400 --> 41:01.480
Damn, open the door right now!
Open the fucking door!

41:03.040 --> 41:06.240
What do you want?

41:10.520 --> 41:12.240
Come on, I know somebody's out there.

41:12.320 --> 41:13.320
Open up.

41:27.120 --> 41:29.800
What's going on? Come on! Open up!

41:34.240 --> 41:35.240
Fuck.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.240
There's nothing there.

42:10.720 --> 42:13.520
Ugh! F... Fuck!

42:16.320 --> 42:17.320
Look…

42:19.400 --> 42:20.440
what do you want?

42:20.520 --> 42:21.520
Just tell me.

42:25.480 --> 42:27.440
Open the fucking door!

42:31.800 --> 42:32.960
Fuck.

43:37.920 --> 43:38.920
<i>He tricked me.</i>

43:44.000 --> 43:46.720
<i>I don't know
how I could have been so stupid.</i>

43:50.280 --> 43:52.840
<i>I was caught in the lion's den.</i>

43:55.840 --> 43:59.680
All I could do
was wait for the cops to arrive.

44:01.480 --> 44:04.520
- Did you get all of that?
- Yes, ma'am, I sure did.

44:12.200 --> 44:13.720
There is no doubt in my mind

44:13.800 --> 44:16.880
that this has been a traumatic situation
for you, officer Sutton.

44:18.280 --> 44:20.880
Someone with your experience
would certainly be an expert

44:20.960 --> 44:22.920
on standard operating procedures.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.720
I have no doubt about that.

44:28.960 --> 44:33.280
And this is a standard we should be held
accountable to, shouldn't we?

44:40.160 --> 44:41.480
Absolutely.

44:45.320 --> 44:47.200
Well, under normal circumstances,

44:47.280 --> 44:52.120
I would most likely be satisfied
and the matter would end here.

44:56.400 --> 44:59.520
But these are no normal circumstances,
are they, officer Sutton?

45:01.920 --> 45:03.200
No, I guess they're not.

45:06.800 --> 45:09.560
As you may know,
you don't have the right to an attorney

45:10.360 --> 45:12.240
during an internal
investigation interview.

45:14.000 --> 45:17.320
Are you aware of your rights
and are you comfortable with this?

45:17.400 --> 45:19.520
What difference would it make?

45:22.520 --> 45:23.520
Can we proceed?

45:25.360 --> 45:26.400
Can I have a smoke?

45:27.320 --> 45:29.720
No, you may not.
City ordinance.

45:45.200 --> 45:46.200
Where was I?

45:46.920 --> 45:48.040
<i>Trapped.</i>

46:07.520 --> 46:08.520
<i>I woke up.</i>

46:10.320 --> 46:12.240
<i>He let me out.</i>

46:26.400 --> 46:27.400
Who let you out?

46:30.920 --> 46:32.120
<i>Did you see him?</i>

46:34.320 --> 46:35.840
<i>Can you give us a description?</i>

46:37.360 --> 46:38.360
I…

46:51.600 --> 46:53.680
<i>What was he doing
in your basement?</i>

46:56.240 --> 46:57.800
He was playing games with me.

47:02.640 --> 47:03.640
<i>He got away.</i>

47:08.480 --> 47:09.960
<i>He made me look like a fool.</i>

47:28.760 --> 47:30.560
Let's talk about your partner.

47:32.320 --> 47:33.320
Did you get along?

47:34.760 --> 47:37.120
I didn't choose my partner. Nobody does.

47:39.760 --> 47:41.280
He was popular on the force.

47:42.200 --> 47:44.200
He's, uh, well-liked.

47:46.520 --> 47:47.600
Hmm <i>…</i>

47:50.760 --> 47:53.120
He's got an impressive list
of accomplishments.

47:56.280 --> 47:58.440
But, uh <i>…</i>

48:00.720 --> 48:03.280
he sets, uh, double standards.

48:07.280 --> 48:12.800
You know, one for him
and his pals on the force

48:14.120 --> 48:16.160
and another for everyone else.

48:21.080 --> 48:23.200
That <i>…</i> That's Paul.

48:41.920 --> 48:43.320
Nobody's perfect, I guess.

48:46.320 --> 48:48.560
So how long were you and Paul
working together?

48:48.640 --> 48:51.880
Seems like ages.

49:11.560 --> 49:15.640
Paul Brenner, Edward Sutton,
Cooper, disappearance <i>…</i>

49:20.040 --> 49:21.920
Paul Brenner, Edward Sutton <i>…</i>

49:25.000 --> 49:28.720
Paul Brenner, Edward Sutton,
Mary Jones, disappearance <i>…</i>

49:31.400 --> 49:33.040
Case unsolved.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.800
Disappearance. Case unsolved.

49:37.880 --> 49:44.880
Case unsolved, case unsolved,
case unsolved…

50:11.840 --> 50:13.040
<i>This is Paul.</i>

50:13.120 --> 50:16.840
- Hey, Paul.
- <i>Why did you call? What is so urgent?</i>

50:16.920 --> 50:19.240
Well, what's that noise?

50:21.600 --> 50:22.720
<i>What noise, Eddie?</i>

50:24.280 --> 50:27.000
- Uh, where are you now?
- <i>Right now, I'm too busy!</i>

50:28.360 --> 50:29.960
Hey, Paul?

50:44.000 --> 50:45.240
<i>What noise, Eddie?</i>

50:55.880 --> 50:57.120
<i>What noise, Eddie?</i>

50:59.880 --> 51:02.240
<i>- Uh, where are you now?
- Right now, I'm too busy!</i>

51:04.520 --> 51:05.960
<i>Hey, Paul?</i>

51:09.240 --> 51:12.200
Paul, what the fuck
are you doing?

51:24.160 --> 51:25.720
<i>Hi, you've reached Rose.</i>

51:25.800 --> 51:28.360
<i>Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you soon.</i>

51:28.440 --> 51:31.160
Rose, listen to me.

51:32.080 --> 51:34.920
I think it'll be best if you stayed away
for a couple of days.

51:35.800 --> 51:39.440
Uh, call me back,
and I'll explain the situation.

51:49.120 --> 51:50.280
<i>I'd been blind.</i>

51:53.680 --> 51:56.320
<i>I thought he was a hard-working cop
like myself.</i>

51:59.480 --> 52:01.400
I'd been chasing shadows

52:01.480 --> 52:04.040
when the answers had been
right in front of me all this time.

52:12.400 --> 52:14.880
<i>Didn't you suspect
your partner earlier?</i>

52:16.800 --> 52:19.200
<i>I didn't have a reason
to suspect him.</i>

52:19.840 --> 52:20.920
<i>How come?</i>

52:23.320 --> 52:24.320
<i>Why not?</i>

52:25.640 --> 52:27.480
<i>My partner and I had been close.</i>

52:29.520 --> 52:31.520
<i>We'd worked together for a long time.</i>

52:34.080 --> 52:36.600
<i>Failure to report misconduct,</i>

52:36.680 --> 52:39.320
<i>would you consider that
a criminal offense?</i>

52:40.640 --> 52:44.680
<i>Failing to report misconduct
in the department is a criminal offense.</i>

52:44.760 --> 52:45.760
<i>I'm aware of that.</i>

52:46.880 --> 52:48.240
<i>They call it blue code.</i>

52:49.160 --> 52:51.960
<i>You protect your partner
even though he's committing a crime.</i>

52:52.880 --> 52:55.560
I would be suspended.
I could go to prison.

52:56.760 --> 52:59.840
<i>Would you cover for him,
out of loyalty?</i>

53:00.440 --> 53:03.200
<i>I'm sure there's a sense of loyalty,
isn't there?</i>

53:03.280 --> 53:06.480
<i>Sure, there's a sense
of loyalty within the department.</i>

53:07.120 --> 53:08.680
<i>But we have a code of conduct.</i>

53:09.760 --> 53:13.800
<i>If you commit a crime,
you have to serve the time.</i>

53:13.880 --> 53:15.280
<i>Even if you're a cop.</i>

53:21.280 --> 53:23.720
Let's see here. That's right.

53:35.160 --> 53:36.160
Okay.

54:10.320 --> 54:11.320
Let's see.

54:12.600 --> 54:13.600
Here I go.

54:16.440 --> 54:17.440
Here I go.

54:18.160 --> 54:20.320
Okay.

54:51.720 --> 54:52.720
Good.

55:11.480 --> 55:12.480
No.

55:18.360 --> 55:19.560
Come on now.

56:05.240 --> 56:07.000
<i>What happened in the basement?</i>

56:18.800 --> 56:20.520
Ed, what happened?

56:31.280 --> 56:32.600
<i>Tell us what happened, Ed.</i>

56:42.320 --> 56:43.320
He was there.

57:47.480 --> 57:49.160
Waiting for backup was impossible.

57:52.320 --> 57:53.800
This was an active incident.

58:06.840 --> 58:08.120
What are you doing?

58:11.480 --> 58:12.640
Open the door.

58:16.360 --> 58:17.360
Hello?

58:21.720 --> 58:25.120
Open the fucking door. Come on, let's go!

58:37.640 --> 58:40.240
Ugh.

58:44.960 --> 58:45.960
Oh, man.

58:51.360 --> 58:52.960
Oh, motherfucker.

58:55.240 --> 58:58.400
Ugh.

59:36.240 --> 59:38.760
<i>Stillwater Police Department,
how can I help you?</i>

59:39.600 --> 59:42.280
Did you get my message?
Where are those troopers?

59:42.360 --> 59:45.480
<i>Hey, Eddie, yes.
They said you weren't at home.</i>

59:45.560 --> 59:48.920
- Did you run that license plate?
- <i>Yes, it's registered to Paul.</i>

59:49.000 --> 59:51.160
- <i>Why?</i>
- Ha-Have you seen him lately?

59:51.720 --> 59:54.920
<i>No, I haven't seen him
in the last couple of days.</i>

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:15.680
Fuck.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:17.880
Come on.

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.080
Stillwater PD.
This is Edward Sutton, over.

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:30.960
Stillwater PD.
Detective Sutton here, over.

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:38.960
Oh, man.

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:41.320
This is, uh, Detective Sutton, over.

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:05.080
Where are you guys?

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:11.720
Paul, I know it's you.

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.400
What's the matter with you?

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:20.080
Talk to me.

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:21.160
Hey.

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:24.400
Hey.

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:25.840
Hello?

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Paul.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:29.960
What are you doing?

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:31.080
If that's you…

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:37.200
the police are on their way, you know.
Should be here any minute.

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.360
Open the door.

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:45.600
Open the fucking door! Come on, let's go!

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:51.440
Damn, open the door right now.
Open the fucking door!

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000
What do you want?

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.600
Okay, quit fucking around. Come on.

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:00.680
Open the door.

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.880
I know you're out there. What do you want?

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:11.680
What's going on? Come on, open up!

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:13.400
What the fuck is this?

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:34.560
Open the fucking door!

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:53.920
<i>Officer Sutton.</i>

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.800
Officer Sutton, what did you find
under the floor?

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:08.880
Officer Sutton.

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:13.520
I don't know.

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.360
- I forget.
- What were you looking for?

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:18.080
Officer Sutton?

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:21.440
I was only trying to help Lisa.

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:24.080
The girl from the news?

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:27.720
I was doing everything in my power
to help Lisa.

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:31.280
You saw her on TV?

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:33.320
No, she called me.
She was in the basement.

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:36.000
I was there. You know, she was hurt.

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:38.240
Her life was in danger.

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:36.240
There is no basement, is there?

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:52.840
<i>Help.</i>

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:55.600
<i>Please help me.</i>

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:00.120
<i>It's the missing girl
from the news.</i>

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:06.120
<i>M</i>-<i>My name is Lisa,</i>
<i>and I</i>-<i>I can't see, I'm tied up.</i>

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:09.440
<i>I called 911,
but they never showed up.</i>

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:12.480
<i>Investigator Paul Brenner speaking.</i>

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:16.600
<i>I found this phone.
I pushed redial.</i>

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.160
<i>Eddie, are you alright?</i>

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:30.240
Officer Sutton, there was no Lisa.

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:04.160
We can't corroborate
your version of events.

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:07.760
As a matter of fact,
we have evidence that suggests otherwise.

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:11.880
There are no records
of a police officer named Paul Brenner.

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:15.280
And our files show
that you mostly patrolled alone.

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:20.240
You're a fucking liar, Ed.
You never called us.

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:23.440
Your landlord reported
suspicious activities.

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:29.760
We've reached
the only plausible conclusion.

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:32.960
You inflicted those wounds on yourself.

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:37.160
And you've created this version of events
because the truth would be too unbearable.

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:47.920
When was the last time
you spoke with your wife Rose?

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:08.800
Hello, Eddie?

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:12.440
- <i>Hi, it's me.</i>
- Oh, hi, honey.

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:18.279
- What's going on? Where are you?
<i>- I'm still at the motel.</i>

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:22.680
- Oh. Oh, okay.
<i>- Near the lake.</i>

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:25.720
Mm. W-When do you think you'll be back?

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:27.399
<i>The storm is getting worse.</i>

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:30.040
Ah, okay, uh…

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:34.080
You know, I was thinking
of that time we went to the lake.

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:36.479
- Remember that?
<i>- Yes.</i>

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.040
Yeah, that was fun.

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:40.960
- Oh, and... And it was raining.
<i>- Uh</i>-<i>huh.</i>

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.536
And it had all those people,
they were running around,

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:46.640
trying to get out of the rain,
get into their cabins.

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:52.120
And then… And then we decided
w-we were gonna go canoeing.

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:55.880
We wanted to canoe
around the lake, in the rain.

01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:58.880
<i>I remember. You were all wet.</i>

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:02.560
Yeah, that was pretty funny.
You know, I'm not much of a paddler.

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:06.479
<i>I know, we couldn't get to shore.</i>

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:11.760
Yeah, so… So when do you think
you're gonna get back here?

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:14.640
<i>They're talking
about days of storms.</i>

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:18.840
Okay, okay. I-I… I really miss you.

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.560
I miss you, too. I love you.

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:22.439
I know. Yeah, me too.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.120
<i>I have to go now.</i>

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:28.920
- Okay.
<i>- See you soon.</i>

01:09:29.479 --> 01:09:30.479
Bye-bye.

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:43.200
Maybe this will refresh
your memory.

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:03.520
You killed her, Ed.

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.080
You can't go back
and undo what you've done.

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:07.920
Your time is up.

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:30.760
Eddie?

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:34.480
Eddie! It's Officer James.
I'm with Officer Burns.

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:37.240
Eddie, are you alright in there?

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:39.360
Eddie, is everything okay?

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:40.840
Eddie, open up!

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:44.600
Damn, what a stench.

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:47.960
You'd better come
take a look at this.

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:54.760
What have you done to her?

01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:56.440
What have you done to Rose?

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.760
Get down on the floor and don't you move.
Get down!

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:01.840
Ooh!

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:04.720
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:07.800
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:09.720
You have the right to speak to an attorney

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:12.280
and to have an attorney present
during a questioning.

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:16.600
<i>If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed to you at no cost.</i>

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:36.000
Edward Sutton, our work here is done.

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:41.200
The state prosecutor
will take it from here.

01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:44.920
Yeah.

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:01.800
<i>This case was clear cut.</i>

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:08.240
<i>We had a crime, a victim, and a suspect.</i>

01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:11.440
<i>The evidence was overwhelming.</i>

01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:14.560
<i>It would all be admissible
in a court of law.</i>

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:18.120
<i>A judge would have to rule
in favour of the plaintiff.</i>

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:24.560
<i>I'm Detective Edward Robert Sutton.</i>

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:29.040
<i>Badge number 5149.</i>

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.280
<i>I've served with honour,
valour, and integrity.</i>

01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:38.200
<i>Case closed.</i>

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:40.840
<i>Paul?</i>

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:44.480
Paul?

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:48.080
<i>Don't you worry.</i>

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:49.240
Paul?

01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:52.000
<i>Yes, I'm here now.</i>

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:53.680
Paul?

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:55.680
W-What's… What's happening?

01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:58.960
<i>You don't have to search anymore.</i>

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:00.720
<i>I'm here.</i>

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:05.120
<i>I'm here for good this time.</i>
