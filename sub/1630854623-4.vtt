00:21.125 --> 00:24.000
<i>Merwyn's dream had become a reality.</i>

00:24.583 --> 00:29.000
<i>Once Eredin's scouting party found</i>
<i>a suitable world, she'd conquer it,</i>

00:29.541 --> 00:33.083
<i>civilizing any inhabitants</i>
<i>who welcomed her empire</i>

00:33.583 --> 00:36.625
<i>and erasing those</i>
<i>who would resist its glory.</i>

00:39.875 --> 00:42.791
Locate food sources above all else.

00:43.708 --> 00:47.625
There will be no civilizing other worlds
till we settle the lowborn here.

00:49.666 --> 00:52.125
Watch Balor as you would
a viper at your feet.

00:53.958 --> 00:58.083
I'll keep Fenrik in my blade's shadow.
He won't risk her.

01:05.458 --> 01:07.458
If you'll do the honors, Balor.

01:09.208 --> 01:10.291
Chief Sage.

01:23.416 --> 01:25.666
May the spirit of Solryth guide you.

01:39.375 --> 01:41.583
Let the new golden age begin.

01:49.750 --> 01:51.000
What is this place?

01:51.583 --> 01:55.125
Look for water.
Scan the horizon for signs of life.

01:55.208 --> 01:56.291
Smoke from fires, anything.

01:56.375 --> 01:58.166
Do you mean to sacrifice them?

01:59.500 --> 02:01.208
Fenrik, you're not my blood.

02:02.583 --> 02:04.083
But you're my blood in heart.

02:04.708 --> 02:07.416
You are the part of me

02:09.208 --> 02:10.708
that I value the most.

02:23.291 --> 02:25.416
What in the name of all the gods…

02:41.083 --> 02:44.208
I gave you everything you wanted,
and still you betrayed me.

02:48.333 --> 02:49.333
On me!

02:50.000 --> 02:53.250
Wherever this takes you,
may you burn for all eternity.

03:26.166 --> 03:28.833
<i>Now you've transformed,</i>

03:28.916 --> 03:33.541
<i>what will you do</i>
<i>with such wonderful Chaos?</i>

03:33.625 --> 03:36.208
I'm going to take
what I've always deserved.

03:37.416 --> 03:38.666
<i>Everything.</i>

04:22.041 --> 04:23.458
Empire grain store.

04:24.750 --> 04:27.791
They're starving down here.
It won't take much.

04:38.625 --> 04:39.666
Good luck.

04:55.375 --> 04:57.333
I've returned with the empress' prisoner.

05:14.208 --> 05:16.250
Empress,
<i>The Book of Monoliths.</i>

05:17.416 --> 05:19.000
Syndril was a genius,

05:19.083 --> 05:22.208
but he didn't realize the full potential
of his magical equations.

05:22.291 --> 05:23.750
This one, in particular.

05:23.833 --> 05:27.458
If I'm right, it allows travel
not just between worlds.

05:27.541 --> 05:28.416
Stop.

05:28.500 --> 05:31.583
We could travel through time itself.

05:36.375 --> 05:37.416
Leave us.

05:50.708 --> 05:54.291
Wasn't easy.
Still, I always deliver what I promise.

05:54.791 --> 05:57.125
So I'll take what I'm owed and leave.

05:57.208 --> 06:00.125
Xin'trean air doesn't agree with me.

06:00.958 --> 06:02.041
And what of the Lark?

06:02.125 --> 06:04.708
Dead. As promised.

06:05.291 --> 06:08.166
Along with some others
who joined her along the way.

06:08.250 --> 06:10.291
You can have them for free.

06:15.166 --> 06:16.291
You're relieved.

06:21.041 --> 06:22.125
Break.

06:22.208 --> 06:25.250
Secure the square.
Move it, move it, move it. Let's go!

06:26.250 --> 06:29.125
-Out front, now!
-Meldof, two up top.

06:29.208 --> 06:32.125
-Don't let them get to the war horn!
-Sound the alarm!

06:32.208 --> 06:33.750
To arms--

06:47.625 --> 06:49.166
Soulreaver.

06:49.666 --> 06:52.208
One of Father's favorite prizes.

06:53.666 --> 06:56.916
Had this been another time,
I'd have returned this to you.

06:58.458 --> 06:59.500
-No--
-Stay there.

06:59.583 --> 07:01.375
But these are new days.

07:01.916 --> 07:03.791
-A bright future lies ahead.

07:03.875 --> 07:05.541
Regretfully, not for you.

07:07.333 --> 07:09.625
You're a sellsword and Ghost Tribe.

07:10.208 --> 07:11.875
So you see why I can't let you go.

07:13.125 --> 07:17.666
You… will honor our agreement.

07:18.583 --> 07:19.666
Honor?

07:20.375 --> 07:22.000
From the legends that I've read,

07:22.083 --> 07:24.500
your Ghost Tribe was honorable
above all else.

07:25.083 --> 07:27.666
And yet here you are, a betrayer,

07:27.750 --> 07:30.416
selling out your fellow warriors
for a bit of metal!

07:30.916 --> 07:32.875
A disgrace to your ancestors.

07:32.958 --> 07:36.500
-I'll skin you alive.
-Take her to the square.

07:36.583 --> 07:39.125
Behead her with the sword
she betrayed her friends for.

07:39.208 --> 07:40.666
I'll haunt you for eternity.

07:40.750 --> 07:44.291
And place her head on the city gates
as a warning to malcontents.

07:44.375 --> 07:49.500
May your womb rot,
and your name be forgotten.

07:59.750 --> 08:01.750
Best get that riot
happening quick.

08:01.833 --> 08:02.875
Go do your thing, Lark.

08:05.208 --> 08:06.583
People of Xin'trea!

08:07.166 --> 08:08.375
We mean you no harm.

08:09.208 --> 08:10.666
We're here for justice.

08:10.750 --> 08:13.750
The grain behind these doors is yours.

08:14.791 --> 08:17.291
Every grain store in this city
belongs to you.

08:17.375 --> 08:22.583
Grain grown by you, the lowborn,
to fatten her empire's armies,

08:22.666 --> 08:24.541
feeding off your blood, sweat and tears.

08:24.625 --> 08:27.333
-All while your own children starve.
-That's right!

08:27.416 --> 08:29.000
She's the Lark.

08:29.083 --> 08:31.041
-Take what's yours!

08:31.125 --> 08:32.000
The Lark?

08:39.708 --> 08:41.291
It's empty.

08:42.208 --> 08:44.916
-It's empty!
-How are we…

08:45.000 --> 08:46.916
-Don't care about the lowborn!
-Shit.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.500
Those bastards!
They've left us nothing!

08:49.583 --> 08:51.666
-How will we survive?
-It's gone!

08:56.166 --> 09:01.041
This is the future under the empress
and her bloody empire.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.250
All that lies ahead for you,
for your children, is starvation.

09:06.750 --> 09:09.458
-We need to rise up.

09:09.541 --> 09:12.583
I know you're scared,
but we'll never have this chance again.

09:13.166 --> 09:14.916
Together, we can win.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
-…an army…
-We can't…

09:55.083 --> 09:58.000
-Go! Spread the word!

09:58.083 --> 10:00.875
Let them know
this is the day the lowborns rise!

10:00.958 --> 10:03.625
-Yeah!
-The day Xin'trea becomes yours!

10:04.791 --> 10:07.250
Let them feel your thorns!

10:08.458 --> 10:11.208
Freedom and food for all!

10:11.291 --> 10:13.500
-Yeah!
-Arm yourselves!

10:13.583 --> 10:14.625
Go!

10:16.375 --> 10:19.291
I thought my magic was powerful.
Well done.

10:19.375 --> 10:23.666
If I fall, you owe me a song,
and I want both me stones in it.

10:23.750 --> 10:24.916
Uthrok Mighty Cock.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.291
He who had two enormous balls
that slew an empire!

10:28.375 --> 10:32.416
Hark that Lark!
On me, you magnificent bastards!

10:38.875 --> 10:40.208
Let's get inside.

10:55.708 --> 10:56.791
Fjall.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.333
What's happened to you?

11:13.041 --> 11:14.291
You have questions.

11:18.250 --> 11:20.958
Everything that you've heard is true.

11:22.083 --> 11:23.541
I had Alvitir killed.

11:24.958 --> 11:25.791
And your family.

11:27.041 --> 11:28.291
All of Dog Clan.

11:29.333 --> 11:33.208
I knew everyone that I loved would die,
and I said yes.

11:34.083 --> 11:35.708
Without a second breath.

11:37.083 --> 11:40.666
I was going to be
a footnote in someone else's story.

11:41.250 --> 11:44.291
I was a fertile thing to be traded.
I was unseen, Fjall!

11:44.375 --> 11:45.291
No.

11:48.291 --> 11:51.125
<i>I</i> saw you.

11:54.041 --> 11:55.666
The old ways had to die.

11:57.041 --> 11:59.000
As much as I loved my brother,

11:59.083 --> 12:01.625
he would have just made the same mistakes
as every king before him.

12:02.958 --> 12:05.541
-But the army and mages are on my side.

12:06.125 --> 12:08.916
They are civilizing other worlds
as we speak.

12:10.416 --> 12:14.208
I will lead us into a new golden age.

12:16.416 --> 12:18.125
And I want you by my side.

12:22.375 --> 12:25.041
I know you'll need time.

12:44.250 --> 12:46.500
You truly are demented.

12:51.375 --> 12:52.875
Do you honestly think

12:54.208 --> 12:57.416
I could forgive you after what you did?

12:59.416 --> 13:05.166
Do you know the sacrifices
my clan had to make just to protect you?

13:06.250 --> 13:09.583
The horrors we inflicted on others
in your name?

13:11.500 --> 13:13.125
And you betrayed us.

13:22.708 --> 13:23.708
You're a monster.

13:30.208 --> 13:32.000
-Oh!

13:33.291 --> 13:34.583
I should know.

13:37.791 --> 13:39.041
-This way.
-Move!

13:46.333 --> 13:48.041
-The prisoner's got free!

14:20.750 --> 14:22.708
You had to be rude about it.

14:27.250 --> 14:28.875
-Focus.
-You focus.

14:28.958 --> 14:32.083
It won't open.
The locks must be dimeritium.

14:32.166 --> 14:35.000
Pissing time before
there's soldiers on our arses 'ere.

14:36.875 --> 14:38.166
That wasn't us.

14:38.750 --> 14:39.708
Get ready.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.333
Done sightseeing?

14:48.291 --> 14:50.666
Bit of color on your face suits you,
so it does.

14:52.708 --> 14:54.583
-Which way to the monolith?
-It's up ahead.

14:54.666 --> 14:57.791
-Where are all the guards?
-Hopefully heading towards the riot.

14:57.875 --> 14:59.666
-Wait.
-Up there!

15:00.666 --> 15:03.625
Go. Destroy the monolith.
We'll hold them here.

15:09.083 --> 15:09.958
Stay alive.

15:10.041 --> 15:12.541
I'll do my best. You mind yourself.

15:14.250 --> 15:16.250
Go, go, go, go!

15:18.333 --> 15:20.833
-To the throne room.
-Kill him on sight.

15:21.416 --> 15:23.166
-Move!
-Strap your tits.

15:35.250 --> 15:36.208
Bollocks.

15:40.375 --> 15:41.375
Aah!

15:49.250 --> 15:50.708
A bit of color suits you too.

15:51.291 --> 15:53.708
-Thanks.
-Fuck me, was it always this tirin'?

15:53.791 --> 15:56.875
Come on, big lad.
We're only just getting started.

16:10.791 --> 16:12.166
No retreat!

16:40.708 --> 16:41.583
Wait, wait, wait.

16:41.666 --> 16:43.208
We're losing control of the lower city.

16:43.291 --> 16:46.958
-We must get you to the Yaruga Barracks.
-No. Just take me to my chambers first.

16:47.541 --> 16:50.250
That's her. Okay, go.
We can make it from here.

16:51.333 --> 16:53.375
-Good hunting.
-And you.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.625
Let's get to the monolith.

17:33.750 --> 17:34.708
You're her.

17:36.125 --> 17:37.125
The Lark.

17:37.875 --> 17:39.000
I thought you'd be…

17:40.583 --> 17:41.500
more.

17:43.375 --> 17:45.916
We've more in common than not,
from what I gather.

17:46.958 --> 17:50.416
Both abandoned lives written for us
to write our own.

17:52.708 --> 17:56.041
Everything I have done
has been for elfkind,

17:56.125 --> 17:59.125
and I will not apologize for that, Lark.

18:00.750 --> 18:03.541
You've no idea what elfkind even is.

18:05.833 --> 18:08.541
-You're just another spoiled princess.
-I am Empress!

18:08.625 --> 18:12.250
You are a child
given the reins of a warhorse.

18:15.208 --> 18:18.000
You don't speak for elfkind.

18:18.083 --> 18:19.458
What, and you do?

18:20.750 --> 18:22.666
They speak for themselves now.

18:26.250 --> 18:29.583
Small minds will always fear
what they don't understand.

18:34.333 --> 18:36.083
Take your revenge, then,

18:36.166 --> 18:39.041
and be done with it, little Lark.

18:41.333 --> 18:44.833
The thought of watching
the life drain from your eyes fed me.

18:46.875 --> 18:50.083
Nourished my broken heart
all this long way.

18:51.833 --> 18:53.791
The closer I got, a thought…

18:55.291 --> 18:56.666
kept eating away at me.

18:59.750 --> 19:01.166
That what you did was right.

19:03.333 --> 19:04.750
Wiping out the monarchies.

19:07.041 --> 19:07.916
And the clans.

19:09.500 --> 19:12.666
We were the monarchies' boots
on the necks of the people.

19:13.375 --> 19:14.833
We were their blade,

19:15.583 --> 19:16.666
without question.

19:23.333 --> 19:25.208
But you are just more of the same.

19:31.958 --> 19:33.625
You changed nothing.

19:39.916 --> 19:41.375
You're just another boot

19:42.250 --> 19:43.625
looking for more necks.

19:48.125 --> 19:49.250
You hear that?

19:51.541 --> 19:53.583
That's the future of elfkind.

19:55.125 --> 19:57.625
And the songs they sing
will not be of you,

20:00.375 --> 20:01.750
but of freedom.

20:06.083 --> 20:08.208
You want to control your own story.

20:09.708 --> 20:10.958
I've given you a choice.

20:12.291 --> 20:14.958
Leave the blade as it is,
and a physic might find you.

20:15.458 --> 20:16.333
Save you.

20:16.875 --> 20:19.875
You'll live long enough
to watch your world crumble around you.

20:20.625 --> 20:21.708
Face your wrongs.

20:24.958 --> 20:27.000
Or pull it out
and bleed to death a coward.

20:27.083 --> 20:28.166
Huh…

20:28.916 --> 20:30.041
No one will know.

20:31.583 --> 20:32.791
No one but you.

20:49.166 --> 20:50.833
Sir! There's been an uprising.

20:57.625 --> 20:59.250
Balor!

21:00.375 --> 21:02.250
You have corrupted everything.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.333
This ends now!

21:15.083 --> 21:16.625
How can he control fire?

21:17.958 --> 21:19.041
Do you feel that?

21:20.458 --> 21:22.875
-The Chaos energy from the other world.
-Yeah.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.250
Huh.

22:19.416 --> 22:20.333
Ah!

22:21.041 --> 22:22.291
Don't mind me, love.

22:22.791 --> 22:23.750
Actually,

22:24.916 --> 22:27.208
you wouldn't know the way
to the royal mint, would you?

22:29.875 --> 22:31.166
Oh, here they are!

22:35.541 --> 22:39.375
You're a lovely lookin' uprising.
Enjoy your freedom while it lasts.

22:39.458 --> 22:42.083
Oh, by the way,
they have peaches in the kitchen.

22:47.458 --> 22:48.666
Remember me.

23:37.166 --> 23:38.583
Fjall, move!

23:45.958 --> 23:46.833
Éile!

24:18.041 --> 24:19.708
-Fjall!

24:41.125 --> 24:44.375
All my life,
people like you have dismissed me.

24:47.500 --> 24:49.291
-No longer.

24:49.958 --> 24:52.208
I control Chaos!

24:52.291 --> 24:54.166
I don't need any of you.

24:58.208 --> 25:00.208
We need to use his power against him.

25:01.208 --> 25:04.291
I'll merge my power with his Chaos energy
to shatter the monolith.

25:09.541 --> 25:10.958
-Now!

25:11.041 --> 25:12.333
Bind me to him!

25:39.625 --> 25:44.166
Isn't it amazing how unscary something is
when you can see its arsehole?

25:46.000 --> 25:47.541
-No!
-Fjall!

25:48.125 --> 25:49.333
Fjall's gone.

25:49.416 --> 25:51.125
-Callan!

25:58.333 --> 25:59.916
No!

26:55.083 --> 26:56.458
Come back to me.

27:18.583 --> 27:19.583
Please.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.750
I can't.

27:31.458 --> 27:32.791
I'll wait for you…

27:34.583 --> 27:38.250
in the great halls of Caer Aenwyn.

27:41.083 --> 27:42.916
Live, Éile.

27:45.541 --> 27:46.791
-Live.

27:51.291 --> 27:52.916
-I love you.

29:15.625 --> 29:17.083
What are you doing?

29:19.000 --> 29:20.041
No.

29:38.958 --> 29:40.500
<i>With a final touch,</i>

29:40.583 --> 29:42.000
<i>-the great mage shattered…</i>
-Syndril!

29:42.083 --> 29:43.333
<i>-his greatest creation…</i>
-Syndril!

29:44.000 --> 29:48.208
<i>…not realizing the energy released</i>
<i>would shatter space and time itself.</i>

29:51.541 --> 29:56.125
<i>The fragile veils between worlds</i>
<i>had been ripped apart.</i>

30:00.541 --> 30:02.833
<i>Planes of existence began to cross.</i>

30:05.166 --> 30:07.625
<i>Skies warred with skies.</i>

30:07.708 --> 30:09.625
<i>Night fed upon day.</i>

30:09.708 --> 30:12.666
<i>Multiple worlds crossed through</i>
<i>each other,</i>

30:12.750 --> 30:15.791
<i>scattering species like seeds</i>
<i>as they merged.</i>

30:19.375 --> 30:22.666
<i>This was the Conjunction of the Spheres.</i>

30:31.000 --> 30:33.541
<i>Every living thing fell…</i>

30:34.041 --> 30:34.958
<i>silent.</i>

30:40.041 --> 30:41.250
<i>And then…</i>

30:43.666 --> 30:44.958
<i>the Continent awoke.</i>

30:56.041 --> 30:58.125
<i>Strange ships lay wrecked,</i>

30:58.208 --> 31:01.791
<i>having cast an even stranger cargo</i>
<i>on Elven shores.</i>

31:06.000 --> 31:10.625
<i>Humans, cast forever</i>
<i>and far from their own world.</i>

31:11.541 --> 31:14.291
<i>Mankind now walked among elves.</i>

31:15.708 --> 31:17.375
-Where am I?

31:21.375 --> 31:23.000
What are you?

31:23.083 --> 31:24.958
Where did you come from?

31:25.041 --> 31:26.125
Help me!

31:29.666 --> 31:32.333
<i>Nothing would ever be the same again.</i>

32:16.750 --> 32:18.375
SYNDRIL, BELOVED BROTHER

33:40.041 --> 33:43.041
WANTED - BRAVE ELVES TO SLAY VODNIKS
TOP COIN PAID

34:04.541 --> 34:05.541
Come eat.

34:07.791 --> 34:10.500
<i>Éile and Fjall had seeded new life.</i>

34:11.125 --> 34:13.750
<i>A child carrying a blood like no other,</i>

34:14.750 --> 34:18.375
<i>one marked by beast and magic.</i>

34:18.458 --> 34:21.125
I haven't had food like this
since leaving Ard Fuile.

34:21.708 --> 34:23.916
Are you sure
you've no Dwarven blood in you at all?

34:24.000 --> 34:26.416
I don't know. What do you think?

34:28.083 --> 34:30.333
-A few generations back, maybe.

34:30.416 --> 34:32.958
-Makes us family, so it does.

34:37.625 --> 34:38.625
It happened, Ithlinne.

34:40.291 --> 34:42.250
I slayed a beast, just like you said.

34:44.791 --> 34:47.000
Only it wasn't the beast I expected.

34:51.125 --> 34:52.000
Can you?

34:56.750 --> 34:57.916
Are you sure?

35:24.500 --> 35:26.708
The time of the spheres
is upon us.

35:26.791 --> 35:29.625
Aen Seidhe lost across the skies.

35:29.708 --> 35:31.166
Cast adrift in time.

35:31.250 --> 35:33.166
-Ever searching for love…

35:33.250 --> 35:35.083
-Lost.
-And left behind.

35:35.791 --> 35:38.875
The Lark's seed shall carry forth

35:38.958 --> 35:43.750
the first note of a song
that ends all times…

35:43.833 --> 35:47.208
<i>And one of her blood shall sing the last.</i>

35:47.291 --> 35:48.583
<i>…the last…</i>

35:49.083 --> 35:50.166
Wait, what?

35:54.291 --> 35:55.291
Who?

35:56.083 --> 35:57.875
Who? Which one of their blood?

35:59.041 --> 36:01.875
<i>Sing the Song of the Seven, Sandpiper.</i>

36:11.291 --> 36:12.208
Oh.

36:12.291 --> 36:14.958
<i>So the oppressed may find</i>
<i>hope and strength</i>

36:15.041 --> 36:16.625
<i>in the tale of their ancestors,</i>

36:17.458 --> 36:18.666
<i>and be ready…</i>

36:19.250 --> 36:21.416
<i>for the great change to come.</i>

37:09.250 --> 37:10.916
-Go on, then.
-Okay.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.500
-Aah!
-Bad luck.

37:13.125 --> 37:14.208
Too bad, too bad.
