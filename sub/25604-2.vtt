00:09.160 --> 00:10.400
What's this, Katekar?

00:11.160 --> 00:12.600
Did Mr. Sartaj kill him?

00:14.560 --> 00:15.880
Why are you laughing?

00:16.400 --> 00:19.120
-How did he get the tip?
-How would I know?

00:19.840 --> 00:22.040
-Don't lie.
-I don't know anything.

00:23.560 --> 00:25.840
How did he surface after 15 years?

00:26.240 --> 00:30.880
-Do I look like an astrologer to you?
-Why are you getting angry?

00:31.680 --> 00:34.440
My wife nags me at home.
I don't need it here.

01:02.040 --> 01:02.920
Sartaj?

01:04.920 --> 01:07.000
-What's going on?
-I received a tip, sir.

01:12.080 --> 01:13.240
Why didn't you tell me?

01:14.080 --> 01:16.920
I had no idea, sir.
I realized when I got here.

01:18.040 --> 01:20.320
Go to the police station.

01:22.400 --> 01:23.800
Majid will take over the case.

01:25.000 --> 01:25.960
It's my case, sir.

01:30.680 --> 01:33.080
Do you have any idea what happened here?

01:35.160 --> 01:36.960
Ganesh Gaitonde has returned.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.960
There's the press,
there are other agencies.

01:40.640 --> 01:42.000
Have you ever dealt with them?

01:43.120 --> 01:44.160
"It's my case."

01:45.760 --> 01:47.120
Just look at yourself.

02:26.960 --> 02:29.560
<i>You can't get away so easily, Mr. Sartaj.</i>

02:34.160 --> 02:37.040
<i>You'll be back to hear my story.</i>

03:32.760 --> 03:34.200
Here, on this day...

03:35.880 --> 03:37.520
I give you my word.

03:38.920 --> 03:40.880
This is Bipin Bhonsle's promise.

03:44.160 --> 03:46.200
In the next four weeks...

03:47.560 --> 03:52.640
we'll make a water train
operational across Maharashtra.

03:56.520 --> 03:59.320
Every village and district
will have water.

04:00.200 --> 04:02.000
Long live India. Long live Maharashtra.

04:06.520 --> 04:10.040
We have the home minister here,
and to welcome him,

04:10.400 --> 04:15.040
I invite our Member of Parliament,
Mr. Rajendra Joshi.

04:17.120 --> 04:20.600
I ask him to present our honored guest,

04:20.680 --> 04:23.400
our home minister, Mr. Bipin Bhonsle,
with a bouquet...

04:24.560 --> 04:26.640
-When did it happen?
-Last night.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.280
Who's the DCP?

04:28.840 --> 04:29.880
Parulkar.

04:31.360 --> 04:32.200
Call him.

04:42.840 --> 04:44.840
Ma'am, to your right.

04:48.280 --> 04:49.720
Mr. Karan!

04:49.840 --> 04:52.720
-Mr. Karan!
-Ma'am, please!

05:02.200 --> 05:03.960
This is my last movie with you.

05:04.080 --> 05:06.480
You're the worst actor
I have ever worked with.

05:06.560 --> 05:09.240
Why? Are you going to star
in <i>Superheroes</i> with Ranbir?

06:02.360 --> 06:04.120
What do you think about the woman?

06:04.680 --> 06:06.080
Looks like an escort.

06:16.040 --> 06:17.800
When did this become a RAW case?

06:19.360 --> 06:20.560
It's an internal matter.

06:31.040 --> 06:34.120
-Yes, Mr. Bhonsle.
-Did one of your men kill Gaitonde?

06:34.880 --> 06:38.200
<i>No... he killed himself.</i>

06:38.720 --> 06:43.200
I want a detailed report on this.

06:43.280 --> 06:45.600
How did the RAW get involved?

06:46.600 --> 06:48.880
One of my men is with them.

06:49.280 --> 06:50.640
<i>I don't care about that.</i>

06:50.720 --> 06:54.080
If he helps the RAW officers,
you will face the consequences.

06:54.760 --> 06:56.560
Don't worry, Mr. Bhonsle.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.680
I'm not worried, Parulkar.

07:01.320 --> 07:05.400
The Naxal threat in Gadchiroli
is something to worry about.

07:07.400 --> 07:10.160
<i>You could be useful there.</i>

07:11.160 --> 07:12.040
<i>Understood?</i>

07:12.480 --> 07:13.320
Yes, sir.

07:17.840 --> 07:20.880
I can't get through to Jojo.
I want my file.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.520
If my name surfaces, everyone's will.

08:00.680 --> 08:02.960
<i>Constable Katekar got a bulldozer...</i>

08:04.000 --> 08:05.440
<i>and we broke down the wall.</i>

08:05.920 --> 08:07.240
<i>It was around 9 a.m.</i>

08:08.120 --> 08:09.240
<i>I went in first.</i>

08:11.280 --> 08:12.560
The first thing I saw was...

08:13.040 --> 08:14.840
a woman's dead body.

08:15.400 --> 08:17.280
She had been shot in the face.

08:20.240 --> 08:21.160
I went ahead,

08:21.800 --> 08:23.760
and saw Gaitonde sitting...

08:24.840 --> 08:26.480
in a corner, on the chair.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.480
He was pointing the revolver towards me.

08:30.120 --> 08:31.560
I gave him a warning...

08:33.360 --> 08:35.960
but he shot himself.

08:40.240 --> 08:42.400
Why did he call you?

08:43.840 --> 08:45.720
I asked him the same question, sir.

08:46.280 --> 08:47.960
He said he needed to talk.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.960
Your father, Constable Dilbagh Singh... was a cop
when Gaitonde was active in Mumbai.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.400
He was a good man, sir.

09:03.720 --> 09:05.680
Any more details about the 25-day warning?

09:06.240 --> 09:08.800
Who? When? Where? Did he say anything?

09:09.360 --> 09:10.200
No, sir.

09:11.240 --> 09:14.240
He just said that Mumbai
will be destroyed in 25 days,

09:14.320 --> 09:16.520
-and to save it.
-Did he give any proof...

09:17.720 --> 09:19.640
to make us take him seriously?

09:20.200 --> 09:22.720
Maybe he had an agenda.

09:22.800 --> 09:24.200
He killed himself, sir.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.080
In front of me.

09:27.040 --> 09:28.520
Nobody lies when their life
is about to end.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.880
Did he mention ISI,
directly or indirectly?

09:32.880 --> 09:34.200
No, ma'am.

09:34.280 --> 09:37.440
Foreigners, neighboring countries,
enemies, currencies?

09:37.520 --> 09:38.440
No, ma'am. Not even once.

09:39.920 --> 09:44.520
Did he say anything about the lady
whose body was found there? Like...

09:44.600 --> 09:48.440
Ma'am, we've checked our database.
There's no match.

09:49.160 --> 09:51.920
Gaitonde was a womanizer.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.120
-He was always with someone.
-I don't think she was an escort.

09:57.120 --> 09:58.760
He said everyone will die...

09:59.080 --> 10:00.080
except for Trivedi.

10:01.880 --> 10:02.840
Who's Trivedi?

10:03.520 --> 10:04.640
I don't know, sir.

10:11.320 --> 10:12.600
Take the report from Sartaj.

10:14.760 --> 10:15.960
<i>What do you think?</i>

10:16.600 --> 10:18.440
<i>He's a low-performing officer.</i>

10:19.520 --> 10:21.760
<i>He needs anxiety pills to fall asleep.</i>

10:23.000 --> 10:25.480
<i>He's put on weight in the last two years.</i>

10:26.360 --> 10:28.080
<i>He's hungry for attention.</i>

10:28.720 --> 10:32.960
<i>I don't know how much we can trust him.</i>

10:37.120 --> 10:38.920
Why did Gaitonde come back?

10:39.680 --> 10:43.480
-Is his old gang still active?
-Is there anyone we could speak to?

10:44.840 --> 10:45.680
Bunty.

10:46.320 --> 10:47.480
His oldest aide.

10:48.720 --> 10:52.400
He runs a construction business
and is a TV producer.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.040
Find him.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.440
Did you decode it?

11:05.920 --> 11:08.160
Do it quickly. E-mail it to me.

11:15.240 --> 11:17.040
What were you saying about that woman?

11:17.760 --> 11:19.240
She was shot in the face.

11:22.920 --> 11:25.360
That shows that the killer was angry.

11:25.880 --> 11:30.120
And if he was so angry,
she was either his friend or his enemy...

11:31.360 --> 11:32.640
not just an escort.

11:36.160 --> 11:37.320
Can you get more details?

11:40.960 --> 11:41.800
What happened?

11:42.680 --> 11:47.120
High-profile cases like these
ruin small-time officers like me.

11:50.760 --> 11:52.600
Find out more and call me.

11:54.640 --> 11:55.640
<i>Sir, I got a call.</i>

11:56.400 --> 11:57.480
I investigated.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.320
You have all the details.

12:07.480 --> 12:10.040
If you support the department
in the Bengali Bura case...

12:12.840 --> 12:14.560
the department will support you.

12:32.720 --> 12:33.600
Why, sir?

12:33.880 --> 12:35.360
For killing Gaitonde.

12:36.440 --> 12:38.200
You haven't even read the report yet.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.640
Surrender your weapon and go home.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.320
Sartaj.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.200
<i>Gaitonde said a name.</i>

13:03.040 --> 13:03.920
Trivedi.

13:07.520 --> 13:08.960
Is it the same Trivedi?

13:14.280 --> 13:15.840
What did he say about Trivedi?

13:16.800 --> 13:19.760
Everyone will die except Trivedi.

13:22.480 --> 13:24.320
-Is that it?
-Yes.

14:01.520 --> 14:04.120
Hey. Turn right.

14:04.480 --> 14:08.080
People think that only cops take bribes.

14:08.600 --> 14:09.480
Sir.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.960
-Yes?
-Sir, my son...

14:13.000 --> 14:15.320
Shamsul. He hasn't returned home.

14:15.400 --> 14:19.240
You told me to come back later.
It's been days now.

14:21.840 --> 14:24.080
-Are you from Bengali Bura?
-Yes, sir.

14:25.040 --> 14:28.200
He must have gone to join Al-Qaeda
or ISIS. Go check.

14:28.760 --> 14:29.840
Stop bugging me.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.040
Get lost!

14:32.120 --> 14:33.520
So annoying.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.800
-Yes, sir.
-Why did he call me?

14:40.400 --> 14:41.280
<i>Who, sir?</i>

14:42.160 --> 14:43.160
Gaitonde.

14:44.280 --> 14:45.960
He could have called anyone.

14:46.400 --> 14:47.240
Why me?

14:47.800 --> 14:48.920
Who knows, sir?

14:49.720 --> 14:51.920
He must have known your father.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.280
-Open it.
-Okay, sir.

17:02.880 --> 17:04.920
<i>I said you'd be back.</i>

17:10.880 --> 17:14.200
<i>My story is like a scorpion,</i>
<i>and it has stung you.</i>

17:15.640 --> 17:17.960
<i>Until you hear the story</i>
<i>of where I came from,</i>

17:18.400 --> 17:20.880
<i>you won't understand</i>
<i>this religious conflict.</i>

18:07.120 --> 18:10.280
<i>We buried our gold in the jungle</i>
<i>outside Gopalmath.</i>

18:10.880 --> 18:12.920
<i>We didn't know what to do with it.</i>

18:13.480 --> 18:18.000
<i>Mathu and I would stare at it</i>
<i>like morons every day.</i>

18:18.080 --> 18:21.440
<i>We thought we would be murdered</i>
<i>if we took it somewhere.</i>

18:21.920 --> 18:24.640
<i>And if we left it there,</i>
<i>it would be stolen.</i>

18:24.960 --> 18:27.640
<i>I even suspected Mathu.</i>

18:46.000 --> 18:49.760
<i>I don't know if the leopard came</i>
<i>to save Mathu or to tell me...</i>

18:49.840 --> 18:54.320
<i>that I was not only the king of the city,</i>
<i>but of the jungle as well.</i>

18:55.800 --> 19:00.800
<i>When I looked into its eyes without fear,</i>
<i>I felt like I was God.</i>

19:01.600 --> 19:04.080
<i>It told me to think big.</i>

19:04.720 --> 19:07.440
<i>Bombay is filthy rich. Ravage it.</i>

19:09.280 --> 19:13.120
<i>In 1985, the mother died</i>
<i>and her son became the prime minister.</i>

19:13.200 --> 19:15.320
<i>He got involved in the Bofors scam.</i>

19:16.000 --> 19:18.480
<i>I thought if the prime minister</i>
<i>was dishonest</i>

19:18.560 --> 19:20.520
<i>how could I walk down a straight path?</i>

19:28.000 --> 19:30.920
<i>The plan to win over Bombay</i>
<i>was clear in my mind.</i>

19:31.880 --> 19:34.760
<i>First, find a rich man</i>
<i>who can launder your money.</i>

19:44.320 --> 19:48.880
<i>Paritosh Shah. My friend, brother,</i>
<i>treasurer, everything.</i>

19:49.960 --> 19:53.920
<i>Money made us very close.</i>

19:56.280 --> 19:58.400
<i>One wife, three kids, and a tiny shop.</i>

19:58.960 --> 20:01.240
<i>The fucker worshiped his safe.</i>

20:01.840 --> 20:03.240
<i>Money was his religion.</i>

20:03.320 --> 20:07.920
<i>And I knew how to make</i>
<i>a religious man my follower.</i>

20:08.760 --> 20:11.680
<i>The next step in the plan</i>
<i>was to start a gang.</i>

20:12.160 --> 20:15.120
<i>In Nagpada Masjid Bunder,</i>
<i>there was a gang down every alley.</i>

20:16.440 --> 20:19.640
<i>So, I came to Kailashpada.</i>
<i>I found new members here.</i>

20:19.720 --> 20:22.480
<i>Bada Badriya, tall and muscular.</i>

20:22.600 --> 20:25.520
<i>He prayed five times a day</i>
<i>and worked out ten times.</i>

20:25.600 --> 20:27.160
<i>And his brother, Chotta Badriya.</i>

20:27.920 --> 20:30.880
<i>He couldn't keep it in his pants,</i>
<i>but he was very loyal.</i>

20:30.960 --> 20:33.840
Hey, take your brother.
He threw up on my bed.

20:36.200 --> 20:37.200
You motherfucker!

20:38.680 --> 20:39.800
Fuck off!

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
<i>I started the gang and then waited,</i>
<i>like a cheetah.</i>

20:43.160 --> 20:45.440
<i>Now we needed a sharp mind.</i>

20:45.640 --> 20:49.160
<i>Someone who knew</i>
<i>every shady motherfucker in the area</i>

20:49.720 --> 20:52.200
<i>-and would direct me to the treasure.</i>
-You asshole!

20:52.320 --> 20:53.680
Don't be a dick to the waiter.

20:54.280 --> 20:56.800
If you bullshit me,
I'll throw you out with the trash.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.280
Get the fuck out of here.

20:58.360 --> 21:00.440
Get out. I don't want any trouble.

21:00.520 --> 21:03.320
-You don't wear lipstick.
-I didn't put much on.

21:03.440 --> 21:05.520
No one's told me to wear it before.

21:06.200 --> 21:08.680
-I love red.
-I love blue.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.640
You fucker! You're drunk, get lost.

21:12.080 --> 21:14.560
Get out of here and don't come back.

21:16.360 --> 21:18.520
Get out of here
or I'll hit you in the face!

21:19.480 --> 21:20.640
I'll use my sandals.

21:20.720 --> 21:22.000
Are you going or not?

21:22.920 --> 21:25.400
-Ganesh Gaitonde.
-So? Should I worship you? -Get out.
-I saw your place.

21:28.040 --> 21:29.160
So what?

21:29.520 --> 21:32.320
-I'm a regular there.
-Everyone is. Now get the fuck out.

21:33.200 --> 21:34.800
-I'm coming for a drink.
-Get lost!

21:34.880 --> 21:36.200
I'll come for a drink.

21:36.280 --> 21:37.960
<i>Then I met Kanta Bai.</i>

21:38.240 --> 21:42.840
<i>She was brave,</i>
<i>but she wouldn't help me at first.</i>

21:42.920 --> 21:46.680
<i>I started a moonshine business with her</i>
<i>to convince her.</i>

21:47.160 --> 21:50.400
<i>Her liquor was top-notch.</i>
<i>Her business grew tenfold.</i>

21:50.760 --> 21:52.520
<i>Then she told me everything.</i>

21:56.960 --> 22:00.720
<i>Kanta Bai said Bombay's riches</i>
<i>were in its garbage.</i>

22:01.280 --> 22:03.480
<i>There was a fucking garbage mafia.</i>

22:04.000 --> 22:07.480
<i>Gopalmath's garbage dump</i>
<i>stretched five kilometers long.</i>

22:07.960 --> 22:10.760
<i>It churned out 70 lakh rupees</i>
<i>worth of garbage every day.</i>

22:10.840 --> 22:15.400
<i>Everything was on sale. Chairs, drums,</i>
<i>the broken neck of a guitar, everything.</i>

22:15.880 --> 22:18.560
<i>And Momin was the king.</i>

22:19.560 --> 22:23.520
<i>My final plan was to replace Momin.</i>

22:24.600 --> 22:27.000
I want to build a house in Gopalmath.

22:27.480 --> 22:28.760
In the garbage.

22:29.360 --> 22:30.960
And I'll do it for sure.

22:34.880 --> 22:36.880
The land you're talking about...

22:37.680 --> 22:39.000
where Gopalmath is...

22:40.320 --> 22:42.960
you were right.
It belongs to the government.

22:44.440 --> 22:47.000
The auction will take place here.

22:48.800 --> 22:52.000
If you want your name on the list...

22:53.520 --> 22:55.040
you'll have to pay up.

22:56.440 --> 23:01.400
Double the amount.
We'll have to bribe everyone.

23:02.320 --> 23:05.000
I want ten plots.

23:05.080 --> 23:06.200
You'll get them.

23:07.040 --> 23:09.280
All ten. It will be done.

23:10.480 --> 23:12.080
I'll have the papers ready.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.760
Pay the money,
and I'll prepare the documents.

23:14.840 --> 23:16.720
Okay? I'm off.

23:22.440 --> 23:23.760
You'll get the money.

23:25.480 --> 23:27.200
But if you try to fuck me around,

23:27.280 --> 23:30.960
I'll chop you up and feed you to the dogs.
I promise you.

23:32.520 --> 23:34.920
<i>There was a part of Mumbai</i>
<i>within my reach.</i>

23:35.080 --> 23:38.760
<i>And there was another part,</i>
<i>alive, glittering, and unattainable.</i>

23:43.240 --> 23:45.960
-Where are you going?
-Inside. Where else?

23:46.440 --> 23:47.760
Do you know what's inside?

23:48.840 --> 23:49.680
What?

23:51.240 --> 23:52.960
It's the boss's den, man.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.040
It's not for beggars.

23:55.760 --> 23:59.880
Go get wasted in some shady local bar.
Understood? Get lost.

23:59.960 --> 24:02.240
Friend, we're not beggars.

24:02.920 --> 24:04.280
We have a lot of money.

24:04.360 --> 24:08.520
If that could get you in,
half of Bombay would be in there.

24:09.080 --> 24:11.040
Know your place and fuck off.

24:12.120 --> 24:15.040
<i>Just as the Taj Mahal enchants people</i>
<i>when they see it for the first time,</i>

24:15.120 --> 24:17.360
<i>I felt the same when I saw Isa</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

24:17.440 --> 24:21.040
<i>The only difference was that people</i>
<i>take photos of the Taj Mahal.</i>

24:21.120 --> 24:23.880
<i>I wanted to bring Isa down.</i>

24:31.240 --> 24:33.920
Who was that guy who just went inside?

24:35.040 --> 24:37.640
Suleiman Isa. Have you heard of him?

24:38.320 --> 24:39.400
<i>Suleiman Isa.</i>

24:40.480 --> 24:45.600
<i>I couldn't get my mind off</i>
<i>his nice car and the pretty lady.</i>

24:47.440 --> 24:48.840
Hey, get out of the way!

25:44.360 --> 25:45.600
Listen, you asshole...

25:46.920 --> 25:49.320
all your talk of buying my land...

25:51.400 --> 25:53.240
will get you killed.

25:54.680 --> 25:57.760
Shut up and get the fuck out of here.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.280
If I ever see you again...

26:02.520 --> 26:03.480
Fucker!

26:20.440 --> 26:22.360
Police Inspector Parulkar.

26:22.840 --> 26:24.080
Congratulations.

26:24.240 --> 26:27.520
Your first case has been registered
at the Kailashpada Police Station.

26:27.640 --> 26:29.000
IPC 435.

26:30.480 --> 26:32.120
Do you have a lot of money?

26:33.120 --> 26:34.080
Is it too heavy?

26:35.160 --> 26:36.360
Where do you live?

26:37.600 --> 26:38.440
Gopalmath.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.360
That's a garbage dump.

26:43.560 --> 26:47.680
Fucking swine. No wonder you stink.

26:50.160 --> 26:52.840
Around here, I see beggars like you
end up dead every day.

26:54.440 --> 26:56.000
Leave Kailashpada.

27:02.680 --> 27:03.920
What did you think?

27:05.160 --> 27:09.200
That you would come here
and become a big man with your money?

27:10.200 --> 27:14.480
Millions of people come here every day
and creep into the sewage like bugs.

27:15.920 --> 27:18.120
They get squashed.

27:21.120 --> 27:23.800
If you want to stay alive,
you need to be brave.

27:24.800 --> 27:27.680
If you want to be a big man,
you need to be brave.

27:41.200 --> 27:42.160
You're packing?

27:44.400 --> 27:45.760
You can come if you want to.

27:50.800 --> 27:51.640
Where are you going?

27:53.760 --> 27:55.480
Back home.

27:56.920 --> 27:57.880
Why?

28:02.720 --> 28:03.760
Are you done?

28:06.520 --> 28:08.240
Let it be.

28:09.480 --> 28:13.200
Are you scared? Tell me.

28:13.280 --> 28:15.120
-Tell me.
-Yes, I'm scared!

28:16.120 --> 28:19.240
I don't want to die in a brawl.

28:23.680 --> 28:24.920
<i>Mathu left for his village.</i>

28:25.200 --> 28:27.200
<i>Parulkar had spotted me.</i>

28:27.840 --> 28:29.800
<i>My name was in his files now.</i>

28:30.280 --> 28:35.000
<i>The municipality guy, Talpade,</i>
<i>took my money and told Momin about me.</i>

28:37.560 --> 28:40.960
<i>The municipality was Momin's.</i>
<i>Parulkar was Momin's.</i>

28:41.800 --> 28:46.040
<i>Kailashpada was Momin's.</i>
<i>I was losing everything.</i>

29:05.360 --> 29:06.520
Momin?

29:07.320 --> 29:10.080
He wants us both to leave.

29:26.400 --> 29:28.760
<i>The municipality guy, Talpade,</i>
<i>was the first to die.</i>

29:40.200 --> 29:42.480
<i>Then there was the fuel.</i>

30:20.760 --> 30:25.360
<i>Momin's business, worth 20 crore rupees,</i>
<i>was reduced to ashes overnight,</i>

30:25.920 --> 30:27.840
<i>and his body was never found.</i>

30:38.840 --> 30:41.960
<i>The smoke hung thick over Bombay</i>
<i>for five days.</i>

30:42.120 --> 30:46.880
<i>From Borivali to Byculla, everyone knew</i>
<i>that Kailashpada had a new boss.</i>

30:49.680 --> 30:51.760
<i>Ganesh Gaitonde.</i>

31:03.760 --> 31:04.960
Hello, Mom.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.480
You haven't slept yet?

31:06.640 --> 31:08.200
<i>We both have this problem.</i>

31:08.280 --> 31:09.600
<i>We don't get enough sleep.</i>

31:10.040 --> 31:13.760
<i>Your father was the only one</i>
<i>who slept soundly.</i>

31:14.240 --> 31:16.400
Switch off the TV
and you'll be able to sleep.

31:16.520 --> 31:18.440
<i>Gaitonde is all over the news.</i>

31:18.640 --> 31:19.800
<i>Weren't you there?</i>

31:19.920 --> 31:22.640
<i>Some of your officers were there,</i>
<i>including Parulkar.</i>

31:22.760 --> 31:25.840
<i>He's in your department, isn't he?</i>

31:26.760 --> 31:30.000
-Yes.
<i>-It would've been nice to see you.</i>

31:30.480 --> 31:31.920
<i>I thought I missed it.</i>

31:33.320 --> 31:34.960
No, Mom, you didn't.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.120
I wasn't there.

31:37.960 --> 31:41.000
<i>When are you coming home?</i>
<i>It's been seven months.</i>

31:41.120 --> 31:42.920
Yes, Mom. I'll come home soon.

31:44.080 --> 31:47.160
-I'll talk to you later. Bye.
<i>-Bye.</i>

31:51.680 --> 31:52.720
Fucker.

33:16.160 --> 33:19.360
Is your Istanbul posting confirmed?

33:24.000 --> 33:25.320
All the action is there.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.640
Doesn't seem like it.

33:29.720 --> 33:30.720
What do you mean?

33:31.800 --> 33:33.800
Still obsessed with working in the field?

33:36.600 --> 33:39.280
If a man wants to work
in the field, it's passion.

33:39.360 --> 33:41.120
If a woman wants to, it's obsession. You're a good analyst,
do what you do best.

34:18.200 --> 34:21.760
Did you find out about Gaitonde's man?
Bunty, the one in construction?

34:23.560 --> 34:25.600
All his offices
and bank accounts have been sealed.

34:26.480 --> 34:28.120
Let's see, we need to push more.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.200
He must be waiting for things to settle.

34:31.280 --> 34:33.400
If he comes out now,
a rival gang will kill him.

34:33.480 --> 34:36.160
Markand, there is no rival gang.

34:43.680 --> 34:46.160
If I say something,
you won't take it badly?

34:49.000 --> 34:51.280
You don't want to prove yourself
in the field.

34:52.640 --> 34:57.360
I think you're doing this
because your father died in the field.

35:04.200 --> 35:05.800
I've been hearing that since the academy.

35:07.120 --> 35:08.480
It's been 16 years.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.240
Listen, take me to the office.

37:02.640 --> 37:03.920
Easy!

37:05.200 --> 37:08.200
Oh, dear. It's all black and blue.

37:09.760 --> 37:10.960
It's infected.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.720
When is the government going to give you
the money for the treatment?

37:16.320 --> 37:20.600
I inquired yesterday. The documents
have been submitted to the ministry.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.800
"The documents have been submitted
to the ministry."

37:24.600 --> 37:26.320
It's been ten years since 26/11.

37:27.400 --> 37:30.720
Why did you take the bullet?
Why did you risk your life?

37:31.160 --> 37:34.600
And what did you get?
A trophy and that's it.

37:34.760 --> 37:38.280
My dear, you've been telling me this
every night for the past ten years.

37:39.800 --> 37:41.640
Am I sitting in the police station now?

37:42.440 --> 37:45.200
I am here, in our house, with you.

37:46.240 --> 37:47.640
Why are you nagging me?

37:48.440 --> 37:49.480
I'm nagging?

37:51.560 --> 37:53.640
That Sikh has performed
black magic on you.

37:53.720 --> 37:55.280
Hey.
-What "hey"?

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Do you get overtime
to wander around with him?

38:00.120 --> 38:03.120
His wife left him and now
you're stuck with him all day.

38:56.480 --> 38:59.320
-Yes, sir.
<i>-I've found her car.</i>

39:00.000 --> 39:01.840
I'll send you the license number.

39:02.400 --> 39:03.800
Find out who the owner is.

39:03.880 --> 39:04.920
Okay, sir.

39:31.120 --> 39:32.120
What do you want?

39:33.440 --> 39:35.400
I have a little work matter. It's urgent.

39:37.280 --> 39:39.800
You're screwed, and now
you want me to be screwed as well.

39:39.880 --> 39:41.400
I didn't come here to beg.

39:41.480 --> 39:45.000
It's important,
and it won't take more than five minutes.

39:45.400 --> 39:49.240
Mr. Sartaj is stuck. This is a huge case.
We just need a little help.

40:46.280 --> 40:47.440
Hurry up!

40:53.960 --> 40:56.600
-Holy shit.
-Does it hurt?

40:57.920 --> 40:59.320
I don't know what to do.

41:02.040 --> 41:05.120
My wife says that a trip to Shirdi
will fix everything. We don't have the money
to pay for better treatment.

41:12.760 --> 41:14.480
Did Parulkar say anything?

41:17.160 --> 41:19.400
"Lie in court and you'll be fine...

41:21.160 --> 41:23.040
speak the truth and get fucked."

41:23.640 --> 41:24.680
Then do it, sir.

41:26.360 --> 41:27.520
-Lie?
-Yes.

41:29.480 --> 41:33.240
These Bengali Bura Bangladeshis...
Motherfuckers.

41:33.360 --> 41:35.320
Why fight the department for them?

41:35.800 --> 41:37.880
Bastards, who knows what they eat?

41:39.320 --> 41:41.560
They drive like crazy during Eid.

41:41.840 --> 41:44.360
That's how they are. Motherfuckers.

41:44.920 --> 41:46.800
There's nowhere to breathe in Mumbai.

41:47.360 --> 41:49.160
-Is it that suffocating?
-Yes.

41:50.360 --> 41:52.560
And when Zoya Mirza's film premieres?

41:52.680 --> 41:53.840
You're first in the line.

41:56.800 --> 41:58.280
That's different, sir.

46:21.360 --> 46:22.240
Katekar.

46:25.920 --> 46:26.920
Holy shit.
