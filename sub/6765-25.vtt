WEBVTT

00:02.871 --> 00:05.430
State Capitals for $200.

00:05.473 --> 00:07.804
''ln 1860, this state capital

00:07.841 --> 00:10.604
became the western terminus
of the Pony Express.''

00:10.642 --> 00:12.700
l know this one.
l know this one.

00:12.744 --> 00:14.040
What is Sacramento.

00:14.078 --> 00:15.510
No, no, no, that's not it.

00:15.546 --> 00:16.273
Eric?

00:16.314 --> 00:17.405
-What is Sacramento?
-Yes.

00:17.447 --> 00:18.572
State Capitals for $300.

00:18.615 --> 00:19.774
''South Dakota's...''

00:19.816 --> 00:20.941
How'd you know that?

00:20.983 --> 00:22.472
He's always been like this.

00:22.518 --> 00:24.007
And Brenda, too.

00:24.053 --> 00:25.747
Their father,
on the other hand...

00:25.787 --> 00:27.811
Hey, hey, don't rub it in.

00:27.855 --> 00:29.515
Answer:

00:33.059 --> 00:34.787
You can get this one, Dad.

00:36.795 --> 00:38.261
Who's Orlando Magic?

00:38.296 --> 00:39.057
Good job.

00:39.163 --> 00:40.390
Anyone?

00:40.431 --> 00:42.295
The correct response is,
What is the Orlando Magic?

00:42.332 --> 00:43.798
You are amazing.

00:43.833 --> 00:45.823
You know, Kelly, if your friend
was really so smart,

00:45.868 --> 00:48.062
he'd get himself down
to Culver City and try

00:48.137 --> 00:49.660
and get on the Jeopardy!
College Championship

00:49.704 --> 00:51.034
they've been
talking about all week.

00:51.072 --> 00:52.333
He should.

00:52.373 --> 00:53.703
Well, l am.

00:53.740 --> 00:54.728
You are?

00:54.774 --> 00:56.297
You're going to be
on College Jeopardy!?

00:56.342 --> 00:57.831
Well, first,
l have to be picked,

00:57.877 --> 01:00.743
but they gave me a time
to try out, so that's a start.

01:00.778 --> 01:02.301
That's so exciting.

01:02.347 --> 01:03.711
Yeah, it should be fun.

01:03.747 --> 01:05.805
Although,
it's still a long shot.

01:05.849 --> 01:07.679
l don't think
it's such a long shot.

01:07.717 --> 01:08.978
l don't think it is, either.

01:09.018 --> 01:10.814
After all,
you're a great player.

01:10.852 --> 01:13.342
You also happen to be
the Student Body President

01:13.388 --> 01:14.718
of California University.

01:14.755 --> 01:17.518
A very handsome student
body president, l might add.

01:17.557 --> 01:21.014
Mom, l don't think they care
which way l comb my hair.

01:21.093 --> 01:23.424
Trust me,
looks counts for something.

01:23.462 --> 01:24.587
And if it doesn't, it should.

01:24.629 --> 01:25.959
Did you know Alex Trebek is one

01:25.997 --> 01:27.156
of the best-dressed men
in Hollywood?

01:27.198 --> 01:28.425
l think l'm going to try out

01:28.465 --> 01:30.022
for Wheel of Fortune instead.

01:30.133 --> 01:31.394
Hey, where are you going?

01:31.434 --> 01:32.900
They haven't even done
Final Jeopardy! yet.

01:32.935 --> 01:34.026
l'm gonna go call Zuckerman.

01:34.103 --> 01:35.694
We sent our postcards in
at the same time.

01:35.737 --> 01:37.363
l want to see
if they called her, too.

01:37.405 --> 01:39.964
Brandon and Andrea
have been talking

01:40.007 --> 01:42.474
about being on Jeopardy!
since they were in high school.

01:42.508 --> 01:44.270
Neat.

01:44.310 --> 01:46.539
Excuse me, but l have
to go talk to Brandon.

01:52.116 --> 01:53.742
What are you doing?

01:53.783 --> 01:56.774
Uh, this isn't a very good time
to talk to Andrea about this.

01:57.986 --> 02:00.545
Okay.

02:00.588 --> 02:02.555
Why not?

02:02.590 --> 02:04.557
l can't say.

02:04.591 --> 02:05.989
l promised.

02:06.059 --> 02:07.992
Kelly,

02:08.060 --> 02:11.085
when one half of a couple
promises not to tell,

02:11.129 --> 02:13.096
it is assumed
that the other half

02:13.131 --> 02:15.291
of the couple is exempt
from said promise.

02:15.332 --> 02:17.458
All right. She had an affair.

02:17.501 --> 02:19.764
-Andrea had an affair?
-Yeah.

02:19.802 --> 02:21.530
She says it's over,
but the damage is done.

02:21.570 --> 02:24.561
So l guess being on a game show
isn't really high

02:24.606 --> 02:26.937
on her list
of priorities right about now.

02:26.974 --> 02:28.133
Mm, l tend to doubt it.

02:28.175 --> 02:30.540
lf you'd like to make a call,

02:30.577 --> 02:31.907
please hang up and try again.

02:31.944 --> 02:33.171
lf you need...

02:35.000 --> 02:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:39.192 --> 03:41.751
lt's just all a waste
of time and money!

03:41.794 --> 03:44.193
Sure, if you sit there
pouting the whole time.

03:44.229 --> 03:46.628
Excuse me, l answered every
question that woman asked me.

03:46.664 --> 03:49.131
Jesse, saying ''l'm sorry,
l don't know how l feel,''

03:49.166 --> 03:50.860
is not a productive response.

03:50.900 --> 03:52.730
Well, maybe
l don't feel comfortable

03:52.769 --> 03:55.168
telling a total stranger
what l'm thinking about.

03:57.505 --> 03:59.472
Jesse, um...

03:59.507 --> 04:01.474
what are you thinking?

04:01.508 --> 04:03.270
l mean, no one's here,
we're all alone.

04:03.310 --> 04:04.708
What are you thinking?

04:04.744 --> 04:06.938
Andrea...

04:09.381 --> 04:11.348
Andrea...
you're just not the girl

04:11.382 --> 04:13.406
l fell in love with anymore.

04:15.451 --> 04:16.940
The girl l fell in love with

04:17.053 --> 04:18.713
was-was self-confident,
she was driven,

04:18.754 --> 04:20.653
she was decisive,
she was going some place.

04:20.689 --> 04:21.882
Well, she got pregnant.

04:21.922 --> 04:24.048
She had to get married,

04:24.091 --> 04:25.614
raise a child and go to school.

04:25.659 --> 04:26.784
Unless, of course, you thought

04:26.826 --> 04:28.156
that Hannah
should have raised herself.

04:28.194 --> 04:30.457
Just forget it.
Let's just drop it, all right?

04:30.496 --> 04:32.190
You know,
l didn't become a mother

04:32.231 --> 04:33.697
and a housewife on my own.

04:33.731 --> 04:35.755
You were involved, too.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.130
So don't hold me accountable

04:37.167 --> 04:39.066
for the decisions
we made together.

04:39.102 --> 04:42.332
l don't remember
being consulted about Peter.

04:45.974 --> 04:49.431
Well, look, l-l better go
pick up Hannah at Mom's.

04:49.476 --> 04:51.340
Jesse, you can't just
say something like that

04:51.377 --> 04:52.536
to me and walk out.

04:52.578 --> 04:54.169
lt's not fair.

04:54.212 --> 04:57.180
What is fair, Andrea?

04:58.949 --> 05:00.939
Hmm?

05:44.182 --> 05:47.378
Okay, this Haitian language
is a mixture

05:47.417 --> 05:49.384
of French
and African dialects.

05:49.419 --> 05:50.885
What is patois?

05:50.920 --> 05:52.079
No.

05:52.121 --> 05:54.645
That's not the right answer?

05:54.689 --> 05:55.848
lt doesn't matter.

05:55.890 --> 05:57.652
lt doesn't count
unless you hit the buzzer

05:57.691 --> 05:59.248
the moment after Alex
reads the answer.

05:59.293 --> 06:01.226
What buzzer?

06:01.260 --> 06:03.853
Oh. Look, if you're planning
on taking home some loot,

06:03.896 --> 06:05.487
you got to concentrate,

06:05.530 --> 06:07.121
and reaction time
is everything, buddy.

06:07.165 --> 06:08.461
Funny.

06:08.499 --> 06:10.489
l thought knowing the right
answers was everything.

06:10.534 --> 06:12.558
-Brandon, you got...
-Steve,

06:12.602 --> 06:14.398
don't l have to become
a contestant

06:14.437 --> 06:15.903
before l can win any loot?

06:16.004 --> 06:18.062
Hey, guys. What are you doing?

06:18.107 --> 06:20.734
Brandon's training
for College Jeopardy!

06:20.775 --> 06:23.174
Really? Good luck.

06:23.210 --> 06:24.335
l hear, the competition

06:24.378 --> 06:25.810
to get on there is going
to be pretty brutal.

06:25.845 --> 06:27.334
Uh, l'm not worried about it.

06:27.380 --> 06:28.744
l think Brandon
can go one-on-one

06:28.781 --> 06:30.771
with anyone from any school
in the country.

06:30.815 --> 06:32.145
Hmm. Problem is,

06:32.183 --> 06:34.582
they usually only pick
one person from each college.

06:34.618 --> 06:36.141
Yeah. So?

06:36.186 --> 06:39.813
So my hunch is,
l'm going to be that person.

06:42.491 --> 06:44.617
You're trying out
for College Jeopardy!, too?

06:44.658 --> 06:48.115
Yeah, it's, uh, something
l've always really wanted to do.

06:48.161 --> 06:50.025
Yeah. Me, too.

06:50.063 --> 06:52.121
Well, l'm afraid at least

06:52.164 --> 06:54.222
one of us is going
to be disappointed.

06:54.265 --> 06:55.754
Well, you know what they say,

06:55.800 --> 06:57.426
''Que le meilleur gagne.''

06:57.468 --> 06:58.695
Ganja? What?

06:58.735 --> 06:59.701
What? What does that mean?

06:59.736 --> 07:01.259
lt means, ''Good luck, sucker.''

07:01.303 --> 07:02.530
Ciao.

07:02.571 --> 07:05.061
She was just trying
to psyche you out.

07:05.106 --> 07:06.538
She was not!

07:06.574 --> 07:08.871
Look, Clare happens to be
a very good player.

07:08.976 --> 07:10.533
ln fact, she spends hours

07:10.577 --> 07:12.407
playing every night
on her computer.

07:12.445 --> 07:14.002
-So?
-So?

07:14.046 --> 07:16.343
So she answers
all the questions in French.

07:16.381 --> 07:17.677
Ha.

07:17.716 --> 07:19.683
Well, good luck
in the tournament.

07:19.717 --> 07:21.308
Boys.

07:21.352 --> 07:23.376
Hey, tell Clare not
to get her hopes up.

07:24.421 --> 07:26.411
-We've got some work to do.
-Yeah.

07:26.455 --> 07:28.581
Okay.

07:34.361 --> 07:36.624
What do you...?

07:36.663 --> 07:38.152
Hi, guys!

07:38.197 --> 07:39.993
Come on in.

07:45.269 --> 07:46.667
Look, Kelly, Daddy's home.

07:46.703 --> 07:49.762
Yeah, l can see that, sweetie.

07:49.806 --> 07:51.272
Uh, what's-what's going on here?

07:51.306 --> 07:52.704
Take a wild guess.

07:52.741 --> 07:54.332
Yeah, a really wild guess.

07:54.376 --> 07:56.400
The wilder the better.

07:58.545 --> 08:01.672
Um, honey, why don't you
go get your coat on, okay?

08:01.713 --> 08:04.306
And-And we'll just go, um...

08:04.349 --> 08:06.816
We'll just go.

08:10.587 --> 08:12.554
How weird was that?

08:12.588 --> 08:14.316
Weird.

08:14.356 --> 08:16.846
That was... that was definitely
one for ''The X Files.''

08:16.925 --> 08:18.551
They looked so happy.

08:18.593 --> 08:20.583
lt was disgusting, wasn't it?

08:21.562 --> 08:23.654
lt must be nice for Erin.

08:23.696 --> 08:25.219
l mean, when l was little,

08:25.264 --> 08:27.857
all l wanted was for Mommy
and Daddy to get back together.

08:27.933 --> 08:31.333
You know,
l-l can't believe that, uh...

08:31.368 --> 08:33.357
Jackie forgave my dad
for all that.

08:33.404 --> 08:34.870
l mean, that's...

08:34.904 --> 08:37.394
l wouldn't blame her
if she never did.

08:37.438 --> 08:38.700
l just... l...

08:38.740 --> 08:40.035
Could you ever do that?

08:40.075 --> 08:42.405
Could you ever forgive somebody
for something like that?

08:42.443 --> 08:44.569
l don't know.

08:44.611 --> 08:47.443
Mm, it would depend
on a lot of things,

08:47.481 --> 08:50.540
like how remorseful
the person was,

08:50.583 --> 08:52.379
or how much l loved them.

08:52.417 --> 08:54.475
Hmm.

08:54.519 --> 08:57.112
l think l could.

08:57.154 --> 08:58.882
l'm not sure.

08:58.921 --> 09:01.252
l wish l could be forgiven.

09:01.290 --> 09:03.257
What are you talking about?

09:03.291 --> 09:05.053
You never cheated on Clare,
did you?

09:05.093 --> 09:06.684
No, l wasn't talking
about Clare.

09:06.727 --> 09:08.023
l was...

09:08.062 --> 09:10.529
l was talking about Donna.

09:16.133 --> 09:18.100
Hi, everyone,
and welcome to Jeopardy!

09:18.135 --> 09:19.465
No, l'm not Ray Pruit.

09:19.504 --> 09:20.765
l want to leave a message
for him.

09:20.804 --> 09:21.929
Here we go, round one.

09:21.972 --> 09:23.404
Well, when he checks in,

09:23.439 --> 09:25.497
will you just tell him
Donna called, please?

09:25.541 --> 09:27.064
No, not Donald! Donna!

09:27.108 --> 09:28.597
D-O-N-N-A.

09:28.643 --> 09:30.371
Yes.

09:30.410 --> 09:33.276
Thank you.

09:33.313 --> 09:35.610
He was supposed
to check in last night.

09:35.648 --> 09:37.342
Ray's a big boy.

09:37.382 --> 09:39.975
He can take care of himself.

09:40.018 --> 09:41.985
Or is that the problem--

09:42.019 --> 09:45.612
that he's a big boy?

09:45.655 --> 09:47.952
What if,

09:47.990 --> 09:50.583
you know, out of sight,
out of mind?

09:50.626 --> 09:51.819
Not a chance.

09:51.859 --> 09:53.519
l hope you're right.

09:53.561 --> 09:55.528
Hey, look at it this way.

09:55.562 --> 09:57.620
lf, um, you and Ray do break up,

09:57.664 --> 09:59.824
you always have David
waiting in the wings.

09:59.865 --> 10:01.422
Clare, l told you.

10:01.467 --> 10:03.525
David and l
are just good friends.

10:03.568 --> 10:05.034
Yeah, l know, l know.

10:05.069 --> 10:06.592
l'm not blaming you
for anything.

10:06.637 --> 10:10.072
David and l had
five months together,

10:10.106 --> 10:12.505
which is about
five months longer

10:12.542 --> 10:15.066
than l've had
with anyone else, so...

10:15.110 --> 10:18.669
So, are-are you guys both cool
with it being over?

10:18.712 --> 10:20.679
Yeah. Yeah.

10:20.713 --> 10:23.579
l think we'll probably
end up good friends.

10:23.615 --> 10:25.377
Eventually.

10:25.417 --> 10:27.213
lf we ever start talking again.

10:27.251 --> 10:28.376
Hmm.

10:28.419 --> 10:29.544
Maybe it's Ray.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.053
Hello?

10:31.087 --> 10:32.485
lt's for you.

10:32.522 --> 10:34.989
Oh. Hello?

10:35.024 --> 10:37.514
Clare, guess who's sitting
right in front of me?

10:37.559 --> 10:38.889
l have no idea.

10:38.993 --> 10:40.516
Well, he's a friend of yours.

10:40.562 --> 10:42.119
He's president
of the student body,

10:42.162 --> 10:43.890
and l'm afraid
he's a bit delusional

10:43.997 --> 10:45.190
about College Jeopardy!

10:45.231 --> 10:46.458
Daddy.

10:46.499 --> 10:47.556
Please, don't embarrass me here.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.066
Clare asked me to remind you

10:49.100 --> 10:50.532
that she's fluent
in five languages.

10:50.569 --> 10:51.535
Yeah.

10:51.570 --> 10:52.536
Don't do this to me, please.

10:52.570 --> 10:53.558
Why are you doing this?

10:53.604 --> 10:55.264
She says the only way you'll win

10:55.305 --> 10:56.965
is if the category
is funny haircuts.

10:58.675 --> 11:00.073
Huh.

11:00.108 --> 11:02.473
Dad, tell him that you're
the one saying that now, please.

11:02.510 --> 11:04.340
Oh, sorry, darling, got to go.

11:04.378 --> 11:05.844
Tell him that it's not me...

11:05.913 --> 11:08.176
Dad... what...

11:08.214 --> 11:11.341
l was just having
a little fun at your expense.

11:11.383 --> 11:13.441
Yeah, l kind of got that, sir.

11:13.484 --> 11:15.542
l'm sure you'll do brilliantly
tomorrow.

11:15.587 --> 11:18.180
And as Clare says,
''Que le meilleur gagne.''

11:19.222 --> 11:20.518
Yes?

11:20.556 --> 11:21.783
Howard!

11:21.824 --> 11:23.882
Thanks for calling me back...

11:32.198 --> 11:34.665
Jesse. You okay?

11:34.700 --> 11:36.166
You don't look so good.

11:36.201 --> 11:37.827
Thanks.

11:37.868 --> 11:39.164
You want some soup?

11:39.203 --> 11:40.226
Coffee.

11:40.271 --> 11:41.737
l need coffee.

11:41.771 --> 11:43.761
Coffee.

12:00.552 --> 12:03.679
Sounds like something l
don't even want to get into.

12:03.721 --> 12:06.689
Trust me, you don't.

12:06.723 --> 12:09.316
Married life can really
take it out of you.

12:09.359 --> 12:11.417
l can imagine.

12:11.460 --> 12:12.585
Thanks.

12:12.628 --> 12:15.528
Can l, uh, get you anything?

12:15.563 --> 12:17.189
No.

12:17.230 --> 12:19.823
l, uh, think l'm going to finish
this chapter, and then head out.

12:19.899 --> 12:21.832
Okay. Good.

12:21.934 --> 12:24.834
The fact is, Andrea and l aren't
doing so great right now.

12:24.936 --> 12:27.062
Honestly don't know
if we're going to make it.

12:27.105 --> 12:28.935
l'm really sorry
to hear that, man.

12:28.972 --> 12:32.770
You don't have to put on an act
on my account, Dylan.

12:32.808 --> 12:35.799
Andrea told me you saw her
go into that motel.

12:37.846 --> 12:40.006
You wouldn't believe
the last few days.

12:40.047 --> 12:42.947
Every word we say
drives the other one nuts.

12:42.982 --> 12:45.211
And l had to move out,
just to preserve our sanity.

12:45.250 --> 12:47.615
l really am sorry to hear that.

12:47.653 --> 12:50.621
Yeah, me, too.

12:50.655 --> 12:52.019
So, what are you going to do?

12:52.056 --> 12:53.352
l don't know.

12:53.390 --> 12:55.448
l can't stay at my folks' house.

12:55.492 --> 12:57.618
They'd die if they knew
what was going on.

12:57.660 --> 13:01.151
My best friend just had a kid,
so that boat's full.

13:01.195 --> 13:02.627
The whole idea of getting
my own apartment's

13:02.664 --> 13:03.891
completely out of the question.

13:03.930 --> 13:05.260
We can barely afford
the one we have now.

13:05.298 --> 13:07.925
Look, Jess, if you're stuck
or something, man,

13:07.967 --> 13:09.092
l could...

13:09.135 --> 13:10.431
Oh, man, thanks.

13:10.468 --> 13:11.798
l was hoping you'd say that.

13:11.870 --> 13:14.167
lt'll only be for a couple
of nights, l promise.

13:14.204 --> 13:16.637
l could make you a loan
was what l was gonna say.

13:16.674 --> 13:17.731
You won't even know l'm there.

13:17.774 --> 13:18.933
Don't put me in the middle

13:18.975 --> 13:20.168
-of this thing, Jesse.
-l promise.

13:20.209 --> 13:21.641
l won't even mention her name,
not once.

13:21.677 --> 13:23.166
That's not the point.

13:23.211 --> 13:26.236
lf l let you stay,
it's like l'm choosing sides

13:26.280 --> 13:28.247
-against her and...
-Look, if Andrea

13:28.281 --> 13:30.771
and l don't get some time apart,
man, we're gonna fall apart.

13:30.817 --> 13:33.614
So, so, actually you'd be doing
Andrea a favor

13:33.652 --> 13:35.278
by letting me move in with you.

13:37.255 --> 13:39.347
Huh?

13:41.391 --> 13:42.687
All right.

13:42.725 --> 13:43.816
A couple of days.

13:43.859 --> 13:45.450
That's great.

13:45.493 --> 13:46.754
And like l said,

13:46.795 --> 13:47.920
you know what?

13:47.962 --> 13:49.758
You won't even know l'm there.

13:49.797 --> 13:51.491
All right.

13:51.532 --> 13:52.930
Quiet as a mouse.

13:59.071 --> 14:01.698
...and l like to translate
German technical manuals

14:01.739 --> 14:03.035
in my spare time.

14:03.074 --> 14:04.301
That's just great.

14:04.340 --> 14:06.398
And last but not least,

14:06.443 --> 14:08.307
we have Brandon Walsh
from California University.

14:08.343 --> 14:10.469
Brandon is the Student
Body President

14:10.511 --> 14:12.535
with an undeclared major

14:12.580 --> 14:14.547
and a grade point average of...

14:14.581 --> 14:16.411
Whoa.

14:16.450 --> 14:18.076
Can we stop tape for a moment,
please?

14:18.117 --> 14:19.913
-Johnny?
-Yes, Alex.

14:19.952 --> 14:21.248
ls something wrong?

14:21.286 --> 14:22.616
Well, it says here that

14:22.654 --> 14:25.622
Brandon's grade point average
is 3.2.

14:26.890 --> 14:28.686
-That's all?
-Yeah.

14:28.725 --> 14:30.692
What's the sense of having
a screening process

14:30.727 --> 14:32.626
if this is what
we're gonna end up with?

14:32.661 --> 14:34.457
l'll have the contestant
coordinators taken out

14:34.496 --> 14:36.122
-and shot, Alex.
-Ah, never mind.

14:36.163 --> 14:37.220
Let's go on.

14:37.264 --> 14:38.560
Um, all right, Brandon,

14:38.599 --> 14:41.726
how do you explain your feeble
grade point average?

14:41.768 --> 14:44.395
Well, as president
of the school,

14:44.436 --> 14:46.528
l do a lot of extracurricular
activities

14:46.571 --> 14:48.197
as well as volunteer work.

14:48.239 --> 14:49.671
-ln fact...
-Right.

14:49.706 --> 14:50.933
Johnny, refresh my memory here.

14:50.974 --> 14:52.907
Wasn't there a lovely
young woman

14:52.942 --> 14:55.136
from California University
that everyone liked?

14:55.177 --> 14:57.371
Yes, a remarkable young woman.

14:57.412 --> 14:58.901
Clare Arnold.

14:58.947 --> 15:00.436
Only child of the Chancellor,

15:00.481 --> 15:02.710
Clare was educated
on three continents,

15:02.750 --> 15:04.740
maintains a perfect 4.0
grade average

15:04.784 --> 15:08.150
and boasts a radiant blend
of physical beauty

15:08.186 --> 15:09.743
and cosmopolitan street smarts

15:09.855 --> 15:13.187
that can only be described as
that certain ''je ne sais quoi.''

15:13.224 --> 15:14.850
Yeah. Clare Arnold.

15:14.891 --> 15:16.255
l really liked her.

15:16.292 --> 15:18.122
So, how did we end up
with this clown?

15:33.872 --> 15:35.668
Just remember, you gotta wait

15:35.706 --> 15:37.673
until the light flashes
before you hit the button.

15:37.708 --> 15:39.334
Steve, you're killing me.

15:39.375 --> 15:40.671
l'm just trying
to psyche you up.

15:40.710 --> 15:41.698
Yeah, l know that.

15:41.744 --> 15:42.869
Don't you think
we should hold off

15:42.911 --> 15:44.036
on the motivational training

15:44.079 --> 15:45.545
till after l pass
the written test?

15:45.580 --> 15:49.207
Guys, did you know that 90%%
of all the applicants

15:49.250 --> 15:50.739
will flunk the general
knowledge exam?

15:50.784 --> 15:52.250
No, Clare.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.581
How did you know that?

15:53.619 --> 15:55.449
Have you been sucking up
to the show's statistician?

15:55.487 --> 15:57.420
Steve, do you always
have to be so nasty?

15:57.455 --> 15:58.443
l don't know.

15:58.489 --> 16:00.012
l guess Clare brings out
the best in me.

16:00.057 --> 16:02.081
lf l could have
your attention, please?

16:02.125 --> 16:03.853
Would everyone
who's trying out today

16:03.893 --> 16:05.621
please follow me
into the testing area.

16:05.661 --> 16:07.287
Prospective contestants only.

16:07.328 --> 16:08.294
Thank you.

16:08.329 --> 16:09.317
That's us.

16:09.364 --> 16:11.331
No, no, Steve, that's us.

16:11.365 --> 16:12.490
Shall we?

16:12.533 --> 16:13.726
-Good luck, Brandon.
-Good luck, Clare.

16:13.767 --> 16:14.926
Thanks, bye.

16:19.738 --> 16:21.705
Hey, Dylan?

16:21.739 --> 16:23.706
Want some coffee?

16:23.741 --> 16:25.731
No. Thanks.

16:30.746 --> 16:32.736
Ow!

16:35.283 --> 16:36.874
Hey, Dylan, you know,
if you wanted me

16:36.917 --> 16:38.713
to do anything around here,
l can help you out,

16:38.752 --> 16:39.945
let me know.

16:39.985 --> 16:41.952
No, don't worry about it.
Really.

16:41.987 --> 16:43.977
Okay.

16:46.790 --> 16:48.916
So, what are you working on,
man?

16:48.959 --> 16:51.426
Well, l'm helping
to write a screenplay

16:51.460 --> 16:53.120
with some guy l met in rehab.

16:53.162 --> 16:54.753
What you... you two guys
work separately

16:54.830 --> 16:56.228
and then compare notes,
is that it?

16:56.264 --> 16:57.924
l make my notes, he makes his

16:57.965 --> 16:59.261
and then l take them
over to him.

16:59.300 --> 17:00.596
He's got this office
over at a motel.

17:00.633 --> 17:01.758
We kind of...

17:01.801 --> 17:04.394
Oh, the motel where Andrea was,
right?

17:05.436 --> 17:07.404
Yeah, l'm, uh, sorry.

17:07.439 --> 17:08.598
Forget l said that.

17:08.638 --> 17:10.435
Okay, you know,

17:10.473 --> 17:12.270
but only, on the day
you caught her, where...

17:12.309 --> 17:14.276
Hey, l didn't catch her.

17:14.310 --> 17:15.936
Whatever the word is.

17:15.978 --> 17:17.204
What did she say?

17:17.246 --> 17:18.473
What could she say?

17:18.512 --> 17:20.343
Jesse, what was our
agreement about this?

17:20.381 --> 17:22.348
l'm not asking you
to take sides,

17:22.382 --> 17:23.678
but l gotta know what happened.

17:23.717 --> 17:25.080
Oh, what, you want the details?

17:25.117 --> 17:26.607
-Yeah.
-Okay, man,

17:26.652 --> 17:27.913
but it wasn't pretty.

17:29.287 --> 17:32.119
Look, there were chains,
there were whips,

17:32.157 --> 17:33.555
there was a clown outfit,

17:33.591 --> 17:35.387
purple fright wigs
were involved,

17:35.426 --> 17:36.892
there were two dwarfs
in attendance,

17:36.926 --> 17:38.893
one wearing scuba gear.

17:38.928 --> 17:40.224
Look, l got video,
l got Polaroids.

17:40.262 --> 17:41.558
What do you want to see first?

17:43.598 --> 17:45.724
They teach us to think like that
in law school.

17:45.766 --> 17:48.461
You know, you get the evidence,
you get an indictment.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.695
Well, stop it, 'cause
you're torturing yourself.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.362
l know.

17:52.404 --> 17:54.871
Worse than that,
you're torturing me.

17:55.907 --> 17:57.874
Okay.

17:57.908 --> 17:59.238
l get the picture.

17:59.276 --> 18:00.572
Not another word.

18:00.611 --> 18:02.601
Promise.

18:07.716 --> 18:09.706
Hey, Dylan?

18:11.718 --> 18:13.116
Do you got any decaf?

18:19.557 --> 18:22.525
Sorry about that phone call
from my father yesterday.

18:22.559 --> 18:24.526
Oh, that's all right.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.585
You know, he and Steve
should start a support group

18:26.629 --> 18:28.596
for people that blow things
out of proportion.

18:28.631 --> 18:30.222
l know, l mean,
to them it's like

18:30.265 --> 18:31.822
we're competing with each other
or something.

18:31.866 --> 18:34.095
-lt's ridiculous.
-Obnoxious.

18:34.134 --> 18:36.601
lt's like they've forgotten
that Jeopardy! is a game.

18:36.636 --> 18:38.830
l mean,
you know how much fun it is

18:38.871 --> 18:40.804
to sit at home
and compete against

18:40.839 --> 18:41.930
the other contestants.

18:41.973 --> 18:44.099
Absolutely.

18:44.141 --> 18:46.108
l mean,

18:46.143 --> 18:47.700
the odds are
that neither one of us

18:47.810 --> 18:50.437
will be one of the students
they pick to be on the show.

18:50.479 --> 18:54.243
Well, l don't agree
with that at all.

18:54.282 --> 18:55.714
Why not?

18:55.783 --> 18:58.683
Well, for one thing,
it's statistically invalid.

18:58.718 --> 19:01.015
When you eliminate

19:01.053 --> 19:04.646
all the lamebrains that are here
and factor in such variables as,

19:04.722 --> 19:07.656
uh, wit and, uh, charm,

19:07.725 --> 19:10.318
l think l have a great chance
of getting on the show.

19:10.360 --> 19:11.656
ls that so?

19:11.694 --> 19:13.217
-Yeah. -Good day, ladies and
gentlemen, this is Alex Trebek,

19:13.262 --> 19:17.321
welcoming you all to the College
Championship contestant test.

19:17.365 --> 19:19.491
Here is your first one.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.159
The category is Famous Quotes.

19:21.201 --> 19:22.462
And the answer is:

19:37.079 --> 19:39.046
Are you looking
at my answer sheet?

19:39.081 --> 19:41.674
And why would l do that?

19:41.749 --> 19:44.012
l don't know, beats me.

19:44.051 --> 19:46.018
Next category is Sports.

19:46.053 --> 19:49.385
The answer is: ''ln 1977,
baseball's American League

19:49.422 --> 19:51.389
''expanded to 14 teams,

19:51.423 --> 19:54.550
including the Toronto Blue Jays
and this team.''

20:13.739 --> 20:15.706
l really admire your stamina.

20:15.740 --> 20:18.230
Even at your age, l don't think
l could have managed school

20:18.276 --> 20:19.902
and the Peach Pit After Dark.

20:19.943 --> 20:21.967
Well, it really doesn't take
much of my time anymore.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.638
l mean the club basically
runs itself.

20:23.679 --> 20:24.645
No kidding?

20:24.680 --> 20:25.873
Yeah, l mean,

20:25.915 --> 20:27.347
the word of mouth is
great, and the promotion,

20:27.382 --> 20:28.643
l haven't spent a dime
in two weeks.

20:28.683 --> 20:30.274
Jim and l just have
to come down.

20:30.317 --> 20:32.250
l mean, we love to dance.
Wouldn't that be fun?

20:32.286 --> 20:33.843
Hmm.

20:33.886 --> 20:35.477
Andrea!

20:35.521 --> 20:36.851
Long time no see.

20:36.888 --> 20:38.855
-Come on sit down, join us.
-No, no, that's okay,

20:38.890 --> 20:40.914
l'm in a rush, l...
Cindy l was hoping maybe

20:40.958 --> 20:42.390
you could watch Hannah
for a couple hours.

20:42.426 --> 20:45.826
You know l would, but my last
tutorial meets today.

20:45.862 --> 20:49.160
lt's gonna be meeting straight
through dinner.

20:49.198 --> 20:50.824
ls everything all right?

20:50.866 --> 20:52.992
Yeah, you know,
l'm-l'm just in a bind.

20:53.034 --> 20:55.001
lf it's really important,
l can watch her.

20:55.035 --> 20:56.433
l have nothing to do for
the rest of the day.

20:59.905 --> 21:02.372
Cindy, tell her... tell her
how great l am with kids.

21:02.407 --> 21:04.306
l mean, l basically
raised my little sister.

21:04.342 --> 21:05.603
l can vouch for that.

21:07.144 --> 21:08.906
Well...

21:08.945 --> 21:10.434
all right, if you're sure?

21:10.480 --> 21:11.673
Yeah, l love kids.

21:11.714 --> 21:12.839
Great.

21:12.881 --> 21:15.178
Where will you be
so l can come pick her up later?

21:15.217 --> 21:17.275
Uh, well, l do have
to go to the club.

21:17.318 --> 21:18.682
Why don't you just come
by when you're finished?

21:18.786 --> 21:20.047
Okay.

21:20.086 --> 21:21.518
Okay. lt's all right.

21:21.554 --> 21:23.953
-Well, this is everything
she needs. -Okay.

21:23.989 --> 21:25.956
Steve, great news.

21:25.991 --> 21:27.617
They released everyone
an hour ago

21:27.658 --> 21:29.124
that didn't pass
the written exam.

21:29.160 --> 21:31.127
What've they been doing
in there all this time?

21:31.161 --> 21:33.458
Playing practice rounds
for the contestant coordinators.

21:33.497 --> 21:34.690
Uh-huh.

21:34.797 --> 21:36.058
This is where they're
gonna separate the cream

21:36.098 --> 21:37.086
from the buttermilk.

21:37.132 --> 21:39.292
What have you got against Clare?

21:39.334 --> 21:40.595
l just don't like the way

21:40.634 --> 21:42.032
she broke up with David
that's all.

21:42.069 --> 21:44.195
Hey, that was a mutual thing
and you know it.

21:44.237 --> 21:45.635
Eh.

21:45.671 --> 21:47.137
Look, Clare is a great person.

21:47.173 --> 21:49.140
Besides, if she
and Brandon can get along,

21:49.174 --> 21:51.141
l don't understand
why we can't be here

21:51.176 --> 21:52.369
without being
at each other's throats.

21:52.410 --> 21:53.933
Clare, what are you gonna do?

21:53.978 --> 21:55.274
Are you gonna
go to the producers?

21:55.311 --> 21:56.675
Tell them l'm a cheater?

21:56.713 --> 21:58.680
-Tell them l should
be disqualified? -No, Brandon.

21:58.714 --> 22:00.010
l'm not an informer, all right?

22:00.049 --> 22:01.913
-But l know what l saw.
-What you saw?

22:01.949 --> 22:04.178
For you to insinuate
that l was looking at your test

22:04.218 --> 22:05.514
is unbelievably bogus.

22:05.552 --> 22:06.609
Bogus?

22:06.653 --> 22:08.119
No, what's bogus was

22:08.155 --> 22:09.883
that lame answer you gave
in Double Jeopardy!

22:11.257 --> 22:13.383
Well, at least it got a laugh
out of the producers,

22:13.425 --> 22:14.823
which is more than l can say

22:14.859 --> 22:16.758
for you saying the question
in French.

22:16.794 --> 22:17.919
No, she didn't?

22:17.961 --> 22:19.450
Ah, but she did.
For she is Clare.

22:19.496 --> 22:22.157
She is a pretentious,
coldhearted ''beech.''

22:23.132 --> 22:24.359
Brandon!

22:24.399 --> 22:26.366
Look, let's settle this
once and for all.

22:26.401 --> 22:29.767
You and me, one-on-one,
the home game of Jeopardy!,

22:29.804 --> 22:30.929
winner takes all.

22:30.970 --> 22:32.197
Losers takes themselves

22:32.238 --> 22:33.602
out of consideration
for the tournament.

22:33.640 --> 22:36.005
Name the time, name the place--

22:36.041 --> 22:37.268
l'll be there.

22:37.309 --> 22:39.606
-l bet you will.
-Mm-hmm.

22:43.647 --> 22:45.637
Sacre bleu.

22:54.054 --> 22:56.021
Where did you steal that?

22:56.055 --> 22:57.351
l didn't steal her.

22:57.390 --> 22:58.856
lt's Hannah.
l'm babysitting.

22:58.890 --> 23:01.119
Wait a minute,
An-Andrea left you with Hannah?

23:01.159 --> 23:02.716
She really must be in a bind.

23:02.760 --> 23:04.454
This is not a good idea.

23:04.495 --> 23:06.223
Why, l just came by to see

23:06.262 --> 23:09.059
if l could arouse
your parental instincts,

23:09.099 --> 23:11.089
or anything else that's
up for being aroused.

23:12.301 --> 23:14.268
Hey, Dylan-- oh.

23:14.302 --> 23:16.735
Sorry, l'll leave you--
Wha-what's Hannah doing here?

23:16.770 --> 23:17.758
Where's Andrea?

23:17.804 --> 23:19.270
Uh, l don't know, she had
to rush off somewhere.

23:19.306 --> 23:21.239
Oh, to see Peter maybe?

23:21.273 --> 23:23.172
-Who's Peter? -Jess,
you're jumping to conclusions.

23:23.209 --> 23:24.573
Let me get this straight;
Andrea left the baby

23:24.609 --> 23:26.508
with somebody she barely knows
and just took off?

23:26.544 --> 23:28.443
-Wait, l didn't say that. -Oh,
so you do know where she is?

23:28.479 --> 23:30.070
-Am l on trial here?
-Jess, you said

23:30.114 --> 23:32.047
you were not going to put me
in the middle of this.

23:32.081 --> 23:34.310
That was before Andrea deserted
our baby to go play doctor

23:34.349 --> 23:35.645
with some little doctor friend
of hers.

23:35.750 --> 23:37.580
-W-What are you talking about?
-Mellow out.

23:39.820 --> 23:41.116
Sorry, l forgot.

23:41.155 --> 23:43.247
You guys are Andrea's friends,
right?

23:43.289 --> 23:44.619
Not mine.

23:44.657 --> 23:47.648
Okay, man, look,
l think you better just go.

23:50.061 --> 23:51.891
You know something?
l think you're right.

23:51.928 --> 23:55.158
Come on, sweetie,
let's go to Grandma's.

23:55.198 --> 23:57.290
-All right?
-Bye, sweetie.

23:57.333 --> 23:58.890
Tell Andrea that l'm at
my parents' house.

23:58.933 --> 24:00.297
l think she's got the number.

24:00.335 --> 24:01.892
Oh,

24:01.936 --> 24:04.233
and so much
for not taking sides, right?

24:15.346 --> 24:17.870
And now let's begin
the Jeopardy! grudge match.

24:17.914 --> 24:18.880
Hmm.

24:18.915 --> 24:21.007
History for $100,please, Alex.

24:21.049 --> 24:22.481
-Excellent choice, Brando.
-Thank you.

24:22.518 --> 24:26.612
''Balkan city in which the heir
to the Austro-Hungarian throne

24:26.721 --> 24:30.678
was assassinated in 1914,
setting off World War l?''

24:31.690 --> 24:33.156
That would be Brandon.

24:33.192 --> 24:34.158
Sarajevo.

24:34.193 --> 24:36.626
-What is Sarajevo?
-Correct.

24:36.694 --> 24:38.490
Wait a second, that was not
in the form of a question.

24:38.529 --> 24:40.519
-He corrected himself.
-l know.

24:40.564 --> 24:42.087
l'm just saying
it merits a warning.

24:42.131 --> 24:43.563
What's going on?

24:43.599 --> 24:46.567
lt's a grudge match between
Brandon and Clare to decide

24:46.601 --> 24:49.467
which of them is more infantile.

24:49.503 --> 24:50.867
lt just needs a warning,
that's all.

24:50.905 --> 24:52.235
Can we just play the game,
please?

24:52.272 --> 24:54.466
How about History for $200?

24:54.507 --> 24:56.269
They're playing Jeopardy!
This is my favorite game.

24:56.308 --> 24:58.104
l sent in a card
so l could be on the show.

24:58.143 --> 24:59.973
Did they respond?

25:00.011 --> 25:02.308
-Uh-huh, they did.
-''...same velocity.''

25:05.048 --> 25:07.072
Clare.

25:07.116 --> 25:08.582
-Brandon.
-Clare.

25:08.617 --> 25:10.379
You call that
a history question?

25:10.418 --> 25:12.214
l'm sorry, that's incorrect.

25:12.253 --> 25:13.219
Brandon.

25:13.254 --> 25:14.720
Uh, have you seen Valerie?

25:14.755 --> 25:16.153
-No, l haven't seen her.
-l guess l'm early.

25:16.190 --> 25:19.352
l'll just...
just hang out and watch.

25:19.392 --> 25:21.188
Don't call me ''she'' when l'm
sitting right in front of you.

25:21.226 --> 25:22.590
Well, maybe she should just
answer the questions and...

25:22.661 --> 25:24.025
Excuse me.

25:24.061 --> 25:27.961
Brandon, Clare, aren't
there usually three players?

25:27.997 --> 25:29.327
Yeah, technically.

25:29.365 --> 25:30.456
Kelly, this is a grudge match
up here.

25:30.500 --> 25:32.467
Yeah, l know,
but l have an idea.

25:32.501 --> 25:33.797
Since you guys just started,

25:33.835 --> 25:35.995
why don't you drop this
macho grudge-match posturing

25:36.037 --> 25:38.163
and test your skills
against a quality player

25:38.205 --> 25:40.604
like Andrea?

25:40.674 --> 25:42.334
What did you say?

25:42.374 --> 25:45.342
l said you're a player and
you ought to be playing.

25:47.979 --> 25:50.446
Yeah, sure, we could start over.

25:50.480 --> 25:52.276
Fine by me.

25:52.316 --> 25:54.112
Who is Mary Shelley?

25:55.917 --> 25:58.578
Who is Walter Cronkite?

26:00.521 --> 26:02.385
What is the lnternet?

26:04.023 --> 26:06.149
What is calculus?

26:06.192 --> 26:08.751
What is onomatopoeia?

26:08.794 --> 26:11.489
Once again, correct, Andrea.

26:11.529 --> 26:14.224
Uh, Literature for $1 ,000.

26:14.264 --> 26:16.163
''19th century American author
renowned

26:16.199 --> 26:17.722
''for stories
in which poor boys become rich

26:17.766 --> 26:19.733
through honesty and hard work?''

26:19.768 --> 26:21.462
Yeah, Brandon.

26:22.804 --> 26:24.771
l have no idea.

26:24.805 --> 26:26.772
l just wanted
to ring in first for once.

26:26.807 --> 26:28.740
Oh, that'll cost you.

26:28.774 --> 26:30.035
Andrea.

26:30.076 --> 26:31.702
Who is Horatio Alger?

26:31.743 --> 26:33.039
Once again, that is correct.

26:33.078 --> 26:34.567
And ladies and gentlemen,

26:34.679 --> 26:36.407
we're back with the final
round of Jeopardy!

26:36.447 --> 26:38.641
after your host-- me--
goes to the bathroom and pukes.

26:43.252 --> 26:44.218
Good job.

26:44.253 --> 26:46.584
Thank you.

26:46.621 --> 26:47.712
l'm so excited.

26:47.755 --> 26:49.779
Hey, Andrea,
can l talk to you for a second?

26:49.823 --> 26:51.119
Yeah, sure.

26:51.157 --> 26:54.852
Do you realize we were just
trounced by a housewife?

26:54.893 --> 26:56.450
Yeah, this is one
of those moments

26:56.494 --> 26:58.757
that scars you for life.

26:58.796 --> 27:01.525
Well, at least l beat someone.

27:01.565 --> 27:03.498
Not that it matters.

27:03.532 --> 27:04.964
Then he was giving me
the third degree

27:05.001 --> 27:06.433
about how l ended up
with Hannah.

27:06.469 --> 27:07.992
You didn't tell him anything,
did you?

27:08.036 --> 27:09.434
Well, what was l supposed
to tell him?

27:09.471 --> 27:10.903
l mean, l think l'm the only one
around here

27:10.938 --> 27:11.995
who doesn't know that you two

27:12.039 --> 27:13.471
are in the middle
of a custody battle.

27:13.507 --> 27:14.734
ls that what he called it?

27:14.774 --> 27:16.536
Well, he was talking
like a lawyer.

27:16.643 --> 27:19.736
Did he say where he was going
to take her?

27:19.778 --> 27:21.904
Your mother-in-law's house.

27:21.946 --> 27:23.412
You know, chief,
seeing as you beat us both...

27:23.447 --> 27:25.914
l'm sorry, l have to go.

27:27.183 --> 27:29.150
What'd you say to her?

27:29.184 --> 27:30.548
l just told her

27:30.653 --> 27:32.950
that l thought Jesse was going
to file for divorce.

27:37.157 --> 27:39.124
Why does it matter where l was?

27:39.158 --> 27:41.557
-Why do you think?
-l told you it's over.

27:41.661 --> 27:43.491
Oh, oh, so now there's
some other mystery destination

27:43.528 --> 27:44.960
l can't know about,
is that it?

27:44.996 --> 27:46.724
l'm not going to stand here
and be interrogated by you.

27:46.764 --> 27:48.958
Well, look, it wouldn't feel
like an interrogation

27:48.999 --> 27:50.397
if you would simply answer
the questions!

27:50.433 --> 27:51.797
All right,
you want to know where l was?

27:51.834 --> 27:53.562
l went to see a lawyer.
Are you happy?

27:53.602 --> 27:56.161
Wait, you already have a lawyer?

27:56.204 --> 27:58.535
Yes, because l know
exactly how your mind works.

27:58.572 --> 27:59.970
You went to the lawyer.

28:00.006 --> 28:01.063
That's your mind.

28:01.107 --> 28:02.164
Don't pin that on me.

28:02.208 --> 28:03.606
Then don't play Mr. lnnocent
with me.

28:03.642 --> 28:05.836
l was worried that you were
going to try to build a case

28:05.878 --> 28:07.742
so you can go and get custody
of our daughter, Hannah,

28:07.779 --> 28:09.006
and then when l spoke to Valerie

28:09.047 --> 28:10.673
l saw that is exactly what
you were trying to do.

28:10.714 --> 28:12.408
l asked Valerie
where you were, which l think,

28:12.449 --> 28:13.506
under the circumstances,

28:13.583 --> 28:15.140
was a fairly reasonable line
of questioning.

28:15.184 --> 28:16.275
No, it's not reasonable.

28:16.319 --> 28:17.785
l told you
l am not seeing Peter anymore.

28:17.819 --> 28:19.979
lt's over...
and it's over with us.

28:20.021 --> 28:22.511
Now, l want my daughter back
and l want her back tomorrow.

28:22.589 --> 28:24.419
-Look, l'm...
-Get out!

28:24.458 --> 28:26.220
Andrea...

28:26.259 --> 28:27.725
Get out.

28:29.428 --> 28:30.951
Fine.

28:30.996 --> 28:33.054
Fine, fine.

28:44.005 --> 28:46.871
Hello?

28:46.907 --> 28:50.103
Oh, hi, Chancellor Arnold.

28:50.142 --> 28:52.701
No, l was just expecting
my boyfriend to call.

28:52.745 --> 28:54.268
He's out of town, which...

28:54.312 --> 28:57.178
which reminds me,
Clare is out, too.

28:57.214 --> 29:01.672
No, l honestly don't know how
she did at the audition today

29:01.718 --> 29:04.447
because l haven't talked
to her.

29:04.486 --> 29:05.452
l sure will.

29:05.487 --> 29:07.852
Okay, bye-bye now.

29:09.623 --> 29:11.590
Okay, l'm serious now.

29:11.624 --> 29:14.490
lf l hear one more Jeopardy!
pep talk from this man...

29:14.526 --> 29:16.425
Oh, l think it's cute.

29:16.462 --> 29:18.156
l think he's obsessed.

29:18.196 --> 29:20.356
And l think it runs
in the family.

29:20.398 --> 29:21.455
The way you were with Brandon

29:21.499 --> 29:23.193
after the tryouts
and at the grudge match,

29:23.233 --> 29:24.824
l've never seen you act
that way before.

29:24.868 --> 29:26.459
l know.

29:26.502 --> 29:28.332
l'm just under a lot of pressure
right now.

29:28.371 --> 29:31.203
Because of College Jeopardy!?

29:31.239 --> 29:33.866
l guess.

29:33.907 --> 29:35.100
l don't know.

29:35.142 --> 29:36.506
l don't know what's wrong
with me lately.

29:36.576 --> 29:38.634
Well, why don't you give it
a rest

29:38.678 --> 29:40.440
and think about something else
for a while?

29:40.479 --> 29:42.571
Yeah.

29:44.515 --> 29:46.505
And here are the categories.

29:46.616 --> 29:49.516
We start you off
with Minnesota Studs.

29:49.586 --> 29:52.577
Next we have...

30:01.060 --> 30:02.151
l'll take Minnesota Studs
for $1 ,000.

30:02.194 --> 30:03.160
The answer is:

30:03.195 --> 30:04.991
''He and his fiery
twin sister...''

30:05.029 --> 30:06.620
Clare?

30:06.664 --> 30:07.857
-Who is Brandon Walsh?
-That's right.

30:07.898 --> 30:09.262
You retain control
of the board, so pick again.

30:09.299 --> 30:12.290
Okay,
l'll take Walshes for $1 ,000.

30:12.335 --> 30:15.735
Answer: ''This Walsh,
one of America's''-- Clare?

30:15.771 --> 30:17.203
-Who is Brandon Walsh?
-That's right.

30:17.239 --> 30:18.535
-Whoo.
-Another $1 ,000 for you.

30:18.606 --> 30:21.540
And that sound means
you're out of Double Jeopardy!

30:21.575 --> 30:24.634
And Clare winds up with $52,000.

30:24.677 --> 30:26.541
Johnny, tell her what she's won.

30:26.578 --> 30:30.444
Well, Clare, you have won
your very own Brandon Walsh.

30:30.481 --> 30:32.880
With movable limbs
and comb-able hair,

30:32.916 --> 30:35.713
this Brandon comes complete
with his very own Mustang

30:35.752 --> 30:38.652
and will provide hours of fun.

30:38.687 --> 30:40.483
Excuse me, Alex.

30:40.522 --> 30:42.546
-Chancellor? -l don't mean
to be a problem here,

30:42.624 --> 30:44.147
but l need Brandon

30:44.191 --> 30:46.385
to take care of some
important university business

30:46.427 --> 30:47.757
far, far away.

30:47.794 --> 30:49.055
-l see.
-Anyway,

30:49.095 --> 30:51.688
the fact is: she prefers guys
who speak French anyway.

30:51.730 --> 30:53.060
-Daddy.
-She does?

30:53.098 --> 30:54.223
Well, then, she's in luck.

30:54.265 --> 30:55.561
Gaston, come on over here.

30:55.599 --> 30:56.758
Viens ici.

31:16.414 --> 31:18.506
Oh, hey, Brand.

31:18.615 --> 31:20.514
Hi. Did l wake you up?

31:20.584 --> 31:22.141
No, l've been up
pretty much all night.

31:22.185 --> 31:23.446
Come on in, have some coffee.

31:23.486 --> 31:27.284
Good, l got bagels,
l got lox, l got cream cheese,

31:27.322 --> 31:30.347
l got lemon wedges and those
funny little green things...

31:30.391 --> 31:31.482
Capers.

31:31.525 --> 31:33.924
Capers, yeah, right.

31:33.960 --> 31:36.860
lt's just sort of my way
of saying thanks.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.054
For what?

31:38.096 --> 31:41.360
For saving me and Clare
from ourselves.

31:41.399 --> 31:43.161
We turned an ordinary
Jeopardy! rivalry

31:43.201 --> 31:45.896
into Mortal Kombat,
but after yesterday it's clear

31:45.936 --> 31:48.165
that you are the person that
should be representing C.U.

31:49.638 --> 31:52.629
Thanks, Brandon,
but l... l can't.

31:52.674 --> 31:54.163
What are you talking about?

31:54.208 --> 31:55.765
You had a great time yesterday.

31:55.809 --> 31:58.538
We've been talking about going
on College Jeopardy! forever.

31:58.611 --> 31:59.907
l know,

31:59.946 --> 32:02.539
but my life is pretty
complicated right now, Brand.

32:06.817 --> 32:10.649
Level with me.

32:10.687 --> 32:12.654
You know my problems with Jesse,
right?

32:12.688 --> 32:17.020
l know that Jesse's living
at Dylan's house,

32:17.058 --> 32:19.525
or at least he was.

32:21.528 --> 32:23.495
Brandon, l had an affair.

32:26.231 --> 32:27.390
Was it serious?

32:27.432 --> 32:29.422
l was ready to leave Jesse.

32:30.467 --> 32:32.866
That sounds pretty serious.

32:32.903 --> 32:35.700
For me it was,

32:35.738 --> 32:39.900
but, uh, Peter--
that's his name--

32:39.941 --> 32:42.670
he didn't feel the same
way about it, not at all,

32:42.710 --> 32:44.506
and now l can't help but wonder

32:44.544 --> 32:46.511
how l could be so clueless
about love.

32:46.546 --> 32:49.070
Welcome to the human race.

32:49.114 --> 32:50.774
No.

32:50.815 --> 32:51.781
No, Brandon,

32:51.816 --> 32:55.216
this is different.

32:55.252 --> 32:58.516
Pregnant or not,

32:58.587 --> 33:00.144
l married Jesse because
l really believed

33:00.189 --> 33:02.349
that we had something special.

33:04.492 --> 33:07.756
And now it's a year later
and we've both cheated.

33:07.794 --> 33:09.192
Jesse, too?

33:09.228 --> 33:11.422
He had a one-night stand.

33:15.066 --> 33:17.863
And now all l know for sure

33:17.902 --> 33:19.664
is that none of this
would have happened

33:19.702 --> 33:23.431
if there hadn't been
something wrong to begin with.

33:23.472 --> 33:24.904
You know, it's not
like Jesse's flawless.

33:24.940 --> 33:27.134
l'm not saying that, but, uh...

33:27.174 --> 33:31.871
l can't help feel
that there is...

33:31.912 --> 33:34.573
something wrong with me.

33:37.615 --> 33:39.912
l may be out of line
saying this,

33:39.951 --> 33:42.851
but l'm going to say it
anyway.

33:45.154 --> 33:49.179
Ever since high school,
you haven't seemed happy.

33:54.861 --> 33:58.159
Somewhere along the line, l just
started backing off things.

33:58.196 --> 34:00.356
You know?

34:00.399 --> 34:04.163
Yale, the school paper,

34:04.201 --> 34:07.067
running for office,

34:07.103 --> 34:09.661
even, God forbid,
College Jeopardy!

34:15.610 --> 34:18.543
l never felt like a failure
before, and now,

34:18.579 --> 34:20.876
l feel like my life
is just such a mess.

34:20.913 --> 34:23.005
Hey, hey, that's not true.

34:23.047 --> 34:24.639
You have a great daughter.

34:24.683 --> 34:26.445
You're a great mother.

34:26.550 --> 34:28.710
You can kick my butt
at Jeopardy!

34:28.752 --> 34:30.116
without even breaking a sweat.

34:30.152 --> 34:33.280
Andrea...

34:33.322 --> 34:35.313
you are a remarkable person.

34:35.357 --> 34:38.916
You really are.

34:41.061 --> 34:43.051
Thanks.

34:45.397 --> 34:47.556
l needed to hear that.

34:48.733 --> 34:49.790
Come here.

34:53.003 --> 34:54.697
Thank you.

35:15.019 --> 35:17.248
Hi. What do you want?

35:17.287 --> 35:18.844
Hi. l'm, uh...

35:18.888 --> 35:20.411
l'm looking for Kelly.

35:20.489 --> 35:22.422
She's not home yet.

35:22.491 --> 35:24.890
Do you mind if l come in
and-and wait for her?

35:24.926 --> 35:26.620
You can do whatever you want.

35:26.661 --> 35:28.628
Thanks.

35:30.130 --> 35:33.360
So, uh, how's Donna holding up,
with Ray out of town and all?

35:33.399 --> 35:34.990
l don't know, David.

35:35.033 --> 35:37.262
Why don't you wait until
she gets out of the shower

35:37.302 --> 35:38.563
and ask her yourself?

35:38.602 --> 35:40.660
What? What did l say?

35:40.704 --> 35:44.433
lf you want to see Donna,
be my guest.

35:44.539 --> 35:45.835
But don't come here and tell me

35:45.874 --> 35:47.636
you want to see Kelly,
all right?

35:47.676 --> 35:50.974
lt's insulting.

35:51.012 --> 35:53.002
l got to go break
some news to my father.

35:53.046 --> 35:54.979
Make yourself at home.

35:59.951 --> 36:01.144
Uh, Donna?

36:04.187 --> 36:05.585
Hello?

36:05.622 --> 36:07.384
Hey, who's this?

36:07.490 --> 36:08.888
This is David. Who's this?

36:08.924 --> 36:10.288
lt's Ray. ls Donna there?

36:10.325 --> 36:12.656
No, Ray.
Donna's in the, uh, shower.

36:12.694 --> 36:14.320
She's in the shower?

36:14.361 --> 36:16.851
Yeah. Can l take a message?

36:16.896 --> 36:18.590
David?

36:18.631 --> 36:21.656
Yeah, l was just waiting
for Kelly.

36:21.700 --> 36:22.597
Hey, is that Donna?

36:22.634 --> 36:24.726
Here, it's for you.

36:24.769 --> 36:27.032
Thanks.

36:27.070 --> 36:28.764
Hello?

36:28.805 --> 36:30.032
Donna.

36:30.073 --> 36:31.903
Ray. Uh, where have you been?

36:31.940 --> 36:33.406
l've been worried sick
about you.

36:33.442 --> 36:34.874
Man, where do l start?

36:34.909 --> 36:37.570
My truck broke down,
and my gig here got postponed,

36:37.612 --> 36:39.135
and then somebody stole
one of my amps.

36:39.179 --> 36:42.204
Then l check into the motel
and l've got five messages from

36:42.248 --> 36:44.408
''Donald'' with your phone number.

36:44.450 --> 36:45.541
l can't believe that operator.

36:45.583 --> 36:47.311
l even told her
how to spell my name.

36:47.352 --> 36:48.613
Anyway, where are you?

36:48.652 --> 36:50.846
l'm at a gas station,
waiting for my truck.

36:50.888 --> 36:52.616
Look, l can't really talk
that long.

36:52.655 --> 36:54.349
l just wanted to run
an idea by you.

36:54.390 --> 36:55.447
What?

36:56.892 --> 36:59.655
Hang on!

36:59.694 --> 37:01.251
Sorry.

37:01.295 --> 37:03.660
Anyway, l'm going to be
in Portland for spring break,

37:03.697 --> 37:05.755
and l was wondering if maybe
you wanted to come

37:05.799 --> 37:07.026
and, uh, visit me.

37:07.066 --> 37:09.090
Oh, my God, of course.

37:09.134 --> 37:11.533
l thought you'd never ask.

37:11.569 --> 37:12.728
Great.

37:12.770 --> 37:14.464
All right, well,
l'll call you later, Donald.

37:14.504 --> 37:15.663
l promise.

37:15.706 --> 37:17.900
-Bye.
-Bye.

37:21.676 --> 37:23.040
l am so relieved.

37:23.078 --> 37:24.374
l mean, you know how long

37:24.445 --> 37:25.968
l've been trying
to get a hold of him?

37:26.013 --> 37:27.001
l was just...

37:27.047 --> 37:28.638
l was beginning to think...

37:28.681 --> 37:30.739
Well, you know, after a while,
you just,

37:30.783 --> 37:32.409
you start to suspect the worst,
and...

37:33.785 --> 37:34.648
l've got to tell Clare.

37:34.685 --> 37:38.244
Uh, actually,
Clare left when l got here.

37:38.288 --> 37:40.278
She did.

37:40.323 --> 37:42.722
Yeah.

37:42.758 --> 37:45.248
David, um...

37:45.293 --> 37:46.486
Look, l...

37:46.527 --> 37:48.585
l feel really bad about you guys
breaking up.

37:48.628 --> 37:51.994
Oh... Oh, don't.
lt, uh, it was for the best.

37:52.032 --> 37:54.022
Yeah, but... l just...

37:54.066 --> 37:56.056
l-l feel kind of responsible.

37:56.101 --> 37:58.125
You shouldn't, really.

37:58.169 --> 38:01.262
Oh, l'm glad to hear
you say that.

38:01.305 --> 38:03.204
You know,
l tried to explain to Clare

38:03.239 --> 38:04.637
how we feel about each other.

38:04.674 --> 38:06.903
-You did?
-Yeah.

38:06.942 --> 38:08.340
l told her we were
just good friends,

38:08.376 --> 38:10.343
and there was absolutely
no romantic thing

38:10.411 --> 38:12.344
happening between us
whatsoever anymore.

38:12.413 --> 38:14.710
l mean, especially since,
you know,

38:14.748 --> 38:15.941
how much l love Ray.

38:15.982 --> 38:18.973
-Yeah.
-Oh, guess what?

38:19.017 --> 38:20.483
Ray invited me to come
to Portland

38:20.518 --> 38:22.348
and visit him
during spring break.

38:22.386 --> 38:24.353
Really, that's, uh,
that's funny 'cause...

38:24.387 --> 38:26.081
well, l was gonna go to Portland

38:26.123 --> 38:28.056
and-and visit my mother
during spring break.

38:28.090 --> 38:31.854
So maybe, uh,
maybe while l'm out there,

38:31.893 --> 38:33.655
we can, uh, hook up
or something.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.864
l can't believe l let you
talk me into this.

38:43.902 --> 38:46.233
Sure you can. l barely
had to twist your arm.

38:46.270 --> 38:48.362
Now l'll be back to pick you up
in a couple of hours. Okay?

38:48.439 --> 38:49.666
That's not really what...

38:49.706 --> 38:51.104
No buts about it, all right?

38:51.141 --> 38:52.368
Except for the ones
you're gonna kick in there.

38:52.407 --> 38:53.600
Oh, right.

38:53.642 --> 38:55.609
Sit yourself down, got get 'em.

38:55.644 --> 38:56.701
Okay, thank you.

38:56.744 --> 38:58.210
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

38:58.246 --> 39:00.213
So what did your dad say
when you told him

39:00.247 --> 39:01.645
you were bailing out.

39:01.681 --> 39:04.205
Have you ever actually seen
a Nobel Prize winner cry?

39:04.250 --> 39:07.241
You know, this could've been us,
my little chickadee.

39:07.285 --> 39:10.946
Yeah, it could've been us.

39:17.459 --> 39:18.618
Hi.

39:20.095 --> 39:21.686
l managed to forget
Hannah's diaper bag

39:21.729 --> 39:23.195
when l left yesterday.

39:23.230 --> 39:25.959
Yeah. lt's right here.

39:25.999 --> 39:27.761
Thanks.

39:28.834 --> 39:31.666
Look, however you feel
about me...

39:31.702 --> 39:32.998
Jesse, l barely know you.

39:33.037 --> 39:35.334
Be that as it may,
you might as well tell me

39:35.372 --> 39:36.633
what you know about Andrea's
affair.

39:36.673 --> 39:38.333
This is ridiculous.

39:38.441 --> 39:39.634
lt is not ridiculous.

39:39.675 --> 39:41.539
Andrea's hired a lawyer,

39:41.577 --> 39:43.237
so it's just a matter of time
before your subpoenaed.

39:43.278 --> 39:45.745
Subpoenaed? For what?
Your divorce proceedings?

39:45.779 --> 39:46.836
ls that what you want?

39:46.880 --> 39:48.608
l'll have to protect myself.

39:48.649 --> 39:50.013
No, no, no, no.

39:50.049 --> 39:52.346
See, this is where
you lawyers mess up the world.

39:52.385 --> 39:54.045
See, you're so busy
protecting yourself,

39:54.085 --> 39:55.517
you didn't stop
for one second to ask,

39:55.554 --> 39:58.113
''What is it l want?
What is it she really wants?''

39:58.155 --> 39:59.553
Well, obviously,
she wants a divorce.

39:59.590 --> 40:01.147
Well, did she say that?

40:01.191 --> 40:02.987
Or have you just been so busy
building up your case,

40:03.026 --> 40:04.788
that you forgot
that the real objective here

40:04.827 --> 40:07.192
is for you guys to work
this thing out, man.

40:07.228 --> 40:09.058
You're married;
you gotta get it back together.

40:09.096 --> 40:11.928
lf not for yourself...
do it for Hannah.

40:15.835 --> 40:18.598
l have no idea how things
got so out of hand.

40:18.636 --> 40:20.102
However they did,

40:20.138 --> 40:22.628
it's your life;
you got to fix it.

40:29.444 --> 40:31.411
Yeah, see ya.

40:48.325 --> 40:49.689
Here we go.

40:49.725 --> 40:52.693
Today's Final Jeopardy! is:

40:56.364 --> 40:58.160
Who...

40:58.198 --> 41:01.757
was...

41:01.801 --> 41:05.860
Thomas... Jefferson?

41:05.904 --> 41:08.463
Going to move down the line
to start with you, Kurt.

41:08.505 --> 41:10.529
Did you have the right
U.S. President?

41:10.574 --> 41:12.131
''Who was Jefferson?''

41:12.175 --> 41:14.335
How did Barbie know that,
sweetheart?

41:14.443 --> 41:17.138
History's Barbie's
favorite subject, Grandma.

41:17.179 --> 41:18.577
Come here.

41:18.613 --> 41:21.809
Now we move to the lady
next to you...

41:21.848 --> 41:23.906
Now you listen to me.

41:23.950 --> 41:25.246
You tell Barbie

41:25.284 --> 41:28.343
she can do anything
she puts her mind to.

41:28.387 --> 41:29.478
Anything?

41:29.520 --> 41:31.009
Anything, bubee.

41:31.055 --> 41:34.023
And don't you ever let
anyone tell her differently.

41:35.359 --> 41:37.223
All right,
that gives you $6,000.

41:37.260 --> 41:39.193
And now we go
to our returning champion...

41:40.328 --> 41:41.817
Good day, ladies and gentlemen.

41:41.863 --> 41:43.989
This is Alex Trebek
welcoming you all

41:44.031 --> 41:46.897
to the College Championship
contestant test.

41:46.933 --> 41:50.424
Yeah, it was nice meeting you.

41:53.738 --> 41:54.965
Andrea.

41:55.006 --> 41:57.667
Hannah insisted
we come down here

41:57.707 --> 41:59.230
and bring you luck.

41:59.276 --> 42:00.367
So, uh, you know...

42:00.442 --> 42:03.467
Well, l think it worked.

42:03.512 --> 42:04.603
l think, l, uh...

42:04.646 --> 42:07.079
l think l may have aced
that test.

42:07.115 --> 42:09.674
No doubt of that.

42:09.716 --> 42:12.115
Um...

42:12.151 --> 42:14.277
l don't know what to say.

42:14.320 --> 42:16.446
You know, things

42:16.488 --> 42:19.320
seemed to have snowballed
so out of control...

42:19.423 --> 42:20.446
l know.

42:20.491 --> 42:23.425
And l agree.

42:24.460 --> 42:26.359
Andrea...

42:28.930 --> 42:31.625
All l do know right now
is that l love you.

42:33.533 --> 42:35.500
l love our daughter.

42:37.636 --> 42:40.900
And l really, really
want to come home.

42:46.642 --> 42:48.871
Oh, Jesse.

42:49.779 --> 42:51.746
l love you.

43:01.653 --> 43:04.052
By the way, ladies and
gentlemen, for those of you...

43:04.089 --> 43:05.453
Clare, this is so exciting.

43:05.489 --> 43:06.785
Don't you wish you'd gone?

43:06.824 --> 43:08.415
Maybe next time.

43:08.458 --> 43:10.584
Yeah, Daddy, maybe next time.

43:10.627 --> 43:11.820
Bran, speaking of next time...

43:11.860 --> 43:13.918
Steve, no offense,
but if there is a next time

43:13.963 --> 43:16.692
l think l'd rather be coached
by the champ here.

43:16.731 --> 43:18.857
You don't know whether
l won or not.

43:18.899 --> 43:20.058
lt was worth a shot.

43:20.100 --> 43:21.293
Andrea, this is killing me.

43:21.401 --> 43:22.594
Did you win or lose?

43:22.635 --> 43:24.033
My lips are sealed.

43:24.070 --> 43:25.696
And so are Hannah's.

43:25.737 --> 43:27.294
Well, that makes no difference.

43:27.339 --> 43:30.000
Dinner's on the house
no matter who wins.

43:30.040 --> 43:31.301
Hey, turn up the sound.

43:31.342 --> 43:33.366
Let's take a look at the answer.

43:41.315 --> 43:42.906
Good luck, players.
