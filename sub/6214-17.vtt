WEBVTT

00:00.068 --> 00:01.262
I don't wanna argue about this.

00:01.036 --> 00:03.596
My environmental group
is meeting here today and that's final.

00:03.773 --> 00:06.606
But we are still airing out the place
from last time.

00:06.776 --> 00:09.506
News flash,
natural deodorant does not work.

00:09.678 --> 00:10.804
Morgan, they're great people.

00:10.980 --> 00:12.811
I mean, they're a little pasty,
a little furry,

00:12.982 --> 00:15.075
a little gamey, but great people.

00:15.251 --> 00:17.913
Well, I'm out of here.
Sabrina, do you wanna go to the mall?

00:18.087 --> 00:20.248
Sorry, I'm already going shopping
with my boyfriend.

00:21.056 --> 00:25.493
Wow, when a guy goes shopping,
it's definitely love.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.074

01:07.537 --> 01:09.528
I need some
of your long-lasting mascara.

01:09.706 --> 01:12.174
Oh, you don't need that.
You look great without makeup.

01:12.342 --> 01:15.209
Actually, I don't think you've ever
seen me without... Thank you.

01:15.378 --> 01:16.811
Yeah.

01:17.547 --> 01:18.605
Wrap it up.

01:18.781 --> 01:19.975
Hey, guys.

01:20.149 --> 01:21.844
Hey, I see
you're just browsing today.

01:22.018 --> 01:23.918
- Whoa, you okay?
Heh.

01:24.087 --> 01:25.315
Yeah, it's these new mules.

01:25.488 --> 01:28.013
They're stylish
but not great for walking.

01:28.191 --> 01:29.681
Then why'd you buy them?

01:29.859 --> 01:31.554
Oh, you have so much
to learn about women.

01:31.728 --> 01:32.990
We're a mystery.

01:33.162 --> 01:35.323
Well,
I'm heading up to the fifth floor.

01:35.498 --> 01:37.830
There's a buyer up there
that wants to look at my designs,

01:38.001 --> 01:40.799
and I have a feeling that today
might be my lucky...

01:40.970 --> 01:42.767
Morgan, watch out.

01:52.882 --> 01:55.180
Did you just see that?

01:55.351 --> 01:56.784
I almost died.

01:57.887 --> 01:59.514
Thank God for that wind.

02:01.657 --> 02:03.784
And for my little wind maker.

02:03.960 --> 02:06.554
Wait, that didn't sound right.

02:06.796 --> 02:09.764
And then, just as I was about
to plummet to my death,

02:09.931 --> 02:13.333
this huge gust of wind
swept me right back up on my feet.

02:13.503 --> 02:15.164
And Sabrina
was completely useless.

02:15.338 --> 02:16.737
She just stood there pointing.

02:16.906 --> 02:19.136
Hey, I'll have you know that...

02:19.308 --> 02:21.776
If that ever happens again,
I promise I won't point.

02:21.944 --> 02:26.278
You know, this whole near-death thing
has really gotten me thinking.

02:26.449 --> 02:30.283
I don't wanna be remembered just
for my fashion sense and great hair.

02:30.787 --> 02:33.722
I wanna be remembered
for being a do-gooder.

02:33.890 --> 02:35.881
But one that looks pretty
and smells nice.

02:36.059 --> 02:37.492
Morgan, that's fantastic.

02:37.660 --> 02:39.787
And I'll support you
in anything you decide to do.

02:40.329 --> 02:42.126
I'm coming
to your environmental meeting.

02:42.298 --> 02:45.096
- Anything but that.
Rox, come on.

02:45.268 --> 02:47.736
Morgan wants to get involved
with someone other than herself.

02:47.904 --> 02:50.065
Okay, fine.
You can help me collate the handouts.

02:50.239 --> 02:51.331
There you go, Morgan.

02:51.507 --> 02:53.270
Collating handouts to save the trees,

02:53.443 --> 02:54.910
which are then cut down
to make paper,

02:55.078 --> 02:56.602
which are what the handouts
are made of.

02:56.779 --> 02:58.303
There you go.

03:00.616 --> 03:03.346
Great dirty denims,
if you're a sharecropper.

03:03.519 --> 03:05.510
And where did you get
these earrings?

03:05.688 --> 03:07.485
Because I am never shopping there.

03:09.125 --> 03:10.615
Okay, who are you?
Why are you here?

03:10.793 --> 03:13.353
And does Sister Mary Elizabeth
know you're skipping class?

03:13.529 --> 03:16.726
Sabrina,
these girls aren't ditching PE.

03:17.633 --> 03:20.625
- We're the Fates.
- The Fates?

03:20.803 --> 03:23.465
You mean the three girls
who manipulate innocent people's lives

03:23.639 --> 03:25.300
with cruel, random acts?

03:25.475 --> 03:28.103
So you've heard of us, cool.
Heh, I'm Paris.

03:28.277 --> 03:30.336
- Mackenzie.
- Ashley.

03:30.513 --> 03:32.640
Uh, I'm hoping this is a social call,
and you're right,

03:32.815 --> 03:34.339
I'm never wearing those jeans again.

03:34.517 --> 03:36.815
- Am I?
- Ooh. Can I tell her why we're here?

03:36.986 --> 03:38.146
Please?

03:38.321 --> 03:40.448
Yeah, if I want it
to come out all wrong.

03:40.623 --> 03:42.488
Mackenzie, go.

03:42.658 --> 03:44.523
We weave a tapestry
of every person's life,

03:44.694 --> 03:46.525
and when it's time
for that person to die,

03:46.696 --> 03:47.890
we snip the thread.

03:48.064 --> 03:49.554
Snip.

03:50.700 --> 03:53.032
Today was Morgan Cavanaugh's time
to die.

03:53.202 --> 03:54.794
But we didn't get to snip.

03:54.971 --> 03:56.438
Do you know why?

03:56.606 --> 03:59.473
Because of that freaky,
unexplained gust of wind?

03:59.642 --> 04:01.405
I mean, lucky break, huh?

04:01.577 --> 04:03.636
You owe us, big time.

04:03.813 --> 04:07.806
- Huge time.
- Yeah, really big, huge time.

04:09.285 --> 04:10.547
Sorry.

04:10.720 --> 04:12.688
I had to save Morgan's life.

04:12.855 --> 04:14.152
I had no choice.

04:14.323 --> 04:16.553
Uh, we make the choices, not you.

04:16.726 --> 04:18.956
I hope you're in the mood
for something horrific.

04:19.128 --> 04:20.390
It's payback time.

04:20.563 --> 04:22.758
But first, mall time.

04:22.932 --> 04:24.763
Let's motor.

04:29.805 --> 04:31.204
<i>Left shoulder, Zeppo.</i>

04:34.210 --> 04:36.872
Well,
it's been nice knowing you, Sab.

04:37.046 --> 04:38.707
Oh, come on, they're schoolgirls.

04:38.881 --> 04:41.611
What are they gonna do, say I can't
have lunch at the cool table?

04:41.784 --> 04:44.548
- Been there.
- Let me put it this way.

04:44.720 --> 04:47.245
They gave Lincoln
his theater tickets.

04:48.257 --> 04:50.748
What am I gonna do?
I can't take on the Fates.

04:50.927 --> 04:52.827
You could do what I always do,

04:52.995 --> 04:57.159
cull the weak one from the herd
and attack her from behind a big rock.

04:57.567 --> 04:59.432
Salem, that's perfect.

05:00.970 --> 05:05.031
Of course, whenever I do that,
I get the tar kicked out of me.

05:08.211 --> 05:10.236
Okay, hold still, Ashley.

05:10.413 --> 05:11.641
Oh.

05:11.814 --> 05:14.783
Oh, bummer, I slipped.
Good luck with that.

05:16.152 --> 05:18.120
You guys.

05:19.822 --> 05:23.883
Excuse me, do you have anything
that will remove this?

05:24.393 --> 05:25.417
Absolutely.

05:25.595 --> 05:27.392
- Sabrina.
- Ashley.

05:27.563 --> 05:29.895
Now isn't this a co-inky-dink?

05:30.066 --> 05:32.626
There you go. All gone.

05:32.802 --> 05:35.168
You know,
you have the most beautiful features.

05:35.338 --> 05:36.999
- Heh, I do?
- Hello?

05:37.173 --> 05:38.572
Look at your nose.

05:38.741 --> 05:40.709
I mean, you could be a nose model.

05:40.876 --> 05:43.936
You know, you could do commercials
for tissues and cold medicine.

05:44.113 --> 05:46.172
- You name it.
- Nasal spray?

05:46.349 --> 05:48.817
Absolutely. Now, hold still.

05:49.852 --> 05:53.185
So how are you guys planning
on killing me?

05:53.356 --> 05:55.187
I couldn't possibly tell you that.

05:55.358 --> 05:57.656
Oh, you have
the most gorgeous lashes.

05:57.827 --> 06:00.728
Okay, Paris wanted
some serious dismemberment,

06:00.896 --> 06:02.887
and Mackenzie
was lobbying for leprosy,

06:03.065 --> 06:05.556
but we settled on you tripping
over a rug this afternoon,

06:05.735 --> 06:08.363
hitting your head on the banister
and going into a coma.

06:08.537 --> 06:11.665
Wow, that's both horrific and boring.

06:11.841 --> 06:14.309
Ashley, can we talk girl to goddess?

06:14.744 --> 06:17.645
Look, I'm really sorry that I stepped in
and saved Morgan's life.

06:17.813 --> 06:19.405
But she's one of my best friends.

06:19.582 --> 06:21.447
You'd do the same thing for a friend,
right?

06:21.617 --> 06:22.845
If I had any.

06:23.019 --> 06:24.179
Well, you've got one now.

06:24.353 --> 06:26.651
Unless I should bash my head
and then fall into a coma.

06:26.822 --> 06:28.221
How much fun would I be then?

06:28.624 --> 06:32.924
Well, I suppose
I could reweave your tapestry.

06:33.095 --> 06:34.426
Hey, there's an idea.

06:34.597 --> 06:36.497
But I'd have to ask Paris
and Mackenzie first.

06:36.666 --> 06:39.157
No, no, uh,
they're not the boss of you.

06:39.335 --> 06:42.463
I mean, don't you decide
your own fate? Ha-ha-ha. Get it?

06:42.638 --> 06:44.663
Ha, ha. No.

06:45.574 --> 06:49.066
But you still have to be punished
for that whole Morgan thing.

06:49.779 --> 06:51.076
Right.

06:51.247 --> 06:55.445
Well, how about if instead of the coma,
I stub my toe?

06:55.618 --> 06:58.212
I mean, that hurts like the dickens.
I did just get a pedicure.

06:58.788 --> 07:00.619
- I'll see what I can do.
- Ha-ha-ha.

07:01.157 --> 07:03.557
Here, take some free blush.

07:03.726 --> 07:05.751
Not that you need it.

07:12.134 --> 07:14.295
Please let me stub my toe,
please let me stub my toe,

07:14.470 --> 07:16.028
please let me stub toe.

07:19.508 --> 07:23.410
No!

07:24.046 --> 07:26.537
Oh. Ow, ow.

07:26.716 --> 07:29.207
Yay! I'm alive. Ow.

07:29.385 --> 07:31.182
Oh, thank you, Ashley.

07:31.587 --> 07:32.849
Are you okay?

07:33.622 --> 07:35.214
Yeah, honestly,
I've never been better.

07:35.391 --> 07:37.256
Carry on saving the planet.

07:37.860 --> 07:40.829
So as I was saying,
if we don't act soon,

07:40.996 --> 07:42.930
these woods
will be turned into a parking lot.

07:43.099 --> 07:46.466
Oh, well, can you tell them to make the
spaces wide enough to fit my Boxster?

07:47.370 --> 07:50.203
I know it's little,
but I like to park diagonally.

07:50.639 --> 07:53.369
It's prettier in profile.

07:54.610 --> 07:56.942
Remember how I was so worried
about her embarrassing me?

07:57.113 --> 07:59.013
Well, we rounded that corner about
40 minutes ago

07:59.181 --> 08:00.580
when she served veal kabobs.

08:00.750 --> 08:03.776
Oh, are there any left?
So I can throw them out.

08:04.353 --> 08:05.752
Morgan is just new at this.

08:05.921 --> 08:07.650
You have to help her out,
show her the ropes.

08:07.823 --> 08:09.984
And someday,
I'm sure she'll make you proud.

08:10.159 --> 08:13.492
Guess what, I just signed us up
for an all-night rave at Big Oak.

08:13.662 --> 08:15.721
It's not a rave, it's a protest.

08:15.898 --> 08:18.389
And Big Oak is not a club, it's a tree.

08:18.567 --> 08:19.898
I'm not following.

08:20.069 --> 08:22.196
You just volunteered us
to sleep in a tree.

08:23.072 --> 08:25.768
See? Aren't you proud of her now?

08:25.941 --> 08:27.431
Gotta go.

08:30.446 --> 08:31.606
Oh, no, you're back.

08:31.781 --> 08:33.749
I mean, welcome back.

08:33.916 --> 08:36.145
There is a whole slew of fashion don'ts
in the other room

08:36.318 --> 08:37.842
just waiting to be humiliated.

08:38.020 --> 08:40.181
We are furious.

08:40.356 --> 08:42.586
How dare you
take advantage of Ashley?

08:42.758 --> 08:44.123
That is our job.

08:44.293 --> 08:47.729
We are so getting you back.
And it is going to be gnarly.

08:47.897 --> 08:53.460
And ugly.
- Yeah, really gnarly and ugly too.

08:53.969 --> 08:56.028
Come on,
I'm in a really good place right now.

08:56.205 --> 08:58.867
I'm not ready to be snipped,
gnarled, or coma'ed.

08:59.041 --> 09:00.941
Please, please,
don't mess up my life.

09:01.310 --> 09:03.676
Hey, how's the love of my life?

09:03.846 --> 09:05.336
You, uh, ready to grab a bite?

09:05.514 --> 09:07.209
No, not now.
Now is not a good time.

09:07.383 --> 09:11.183
- So who is this?
- No one.

09:11.353 --> 09:13.082
No one at all.
Just some wandering vagabond.

09:13.255 --> 09:14.688
Take some bread and be gone.

09:14.857 --> 09:16.415
"Love of my life," huh?

09:16.592 --> 09:18.924
Uh, Sabrina, what's going on?

09:19.094 --> 09:22.154
Local cheerleaders selling candy bars
which I promised to buy thousands of

09:22.331 --> 09:23.958
if you'll just skip along
your merry way.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.127
He is so cute.

09:27.303 --> 09:28.395
Cute?

09:28.571 --> 09:31.039
He is drop-dead gorgeous.

09:31.941 --> 09:34.307
- Emphasis on the "drop dead. "
- No.

09:34.477 --> 09:36.945
Hey, hey, Sabrina. Let the girl talk.

09:38.347 --> 09:40.212
I guess we should be going.

09:40.382 --> 09:43.180
Um, Sabrina,
you're a tough customer.

09:43.352 --> 09:45.252
But we'll figure out a way
to get to you.

09:45.421 --> 09:47.582
And I think we just did.

09:47.756 --> 09:48.848
Snip, snip.

09:49.024 --> 09:52.221
No! Anything but the snip.

09:52.995 --> 09:55.793
I just like you with long hair.

09:56.265 --> 09:58.358
And breathing.

10:03.839 --> 10:06.603
Fate, fate, "Twist of... "

10:06.775 --> 10:07.799
"Fickle Finger of... "

10:07.977 --> 10:10.275
Oh, why isn't there anything
about stopping Fate?

10:10.446 --> 10:11.970
Who knows
what they're gonna do to Aaron

10:12.147 --> 10:13.409
unless I come up with something?

10:13.582 --> 10:15.015
- Oh, boy.
- Here's something.

10:15.184 --> 10:18.278
"To cheat death, the Fates
must be thwarted three times. "

10:18.454 --> 10:21.685
- Thwarted? Who am I, Batman?
- Hmm.

10:24.059 --> 10:25.890
Oh, thanks.

10:27.263 --> 10:28.992
Don't eat that!

10:29.164 --> 10:31.189
- Why not?
- Because it could kill you.

10:31.667 --> 10:34.067
Like meat does
when it's improperly prepared

10:34.236 --> 10:36.466
or laced with strychnine.

10:36.939 --> 10:39.533
Oh, who puts Swiss cheese
on a burger?

10:39.708 --> 10:42.268
Um, the cook,
when you order it that way?

10:43.312 --> 10:44.779
Thanks.

10:44.980 --> 10:47.778
- Any issue with the fries?
- No, I'm sure they're fine.

10:51.253 --> 10:53.016
Not fine.

10:57.026 --> 10:58.152
Oh.

10:58.327 --> 10:59.692
Thanks.

10:59.862 --> 11:01.489
You ever heard
of the Heimlich maneuver?

11:01.664 --> 11:04.656
Uh, I prefer the Pez maneuver.
But at least you're safe.

11:04.833 --> 11:06.801
Unless that's where
I lost my charm bracelet.

11:06.969 --> 11:10.461
Hey, aren't those the girls
I just saw at your house?

11:11.974 --> 11:15.501
Sullen and unemployed.

11:15.678 --> 11:17.145
And vindictive.

11:17.313 --> 11:19.144
Well, anyway, that's enough eating.

11:19.315 --> 11:20.543
Time to walk it off. Obesity.

11:20.716 --> 11:22.479
America's silent killer.

11:23.485 --> 11:25.851
- I still have to pay for that burger.
- It's okay. I'm running a tab.

11:27.222 --> 11:29.190
Flying death stars. Get down.

11:30.326 --> 11:31.418
Flying death stars?

11:31.594 --> 11:33.027
Over at that Chinese restaurant.

11:33.195 --> 11:35.595
Oh, but spicy?
Yeah, that's the death part.

11:35.764 --> 11:37.254
Let's go.

11:38.634 --> 11:39.658
This could turn out okay.

11:39.835 --> 11:42.429
As long as we're up in this tree,
they can't chop it down.

11:42.605 --> 11:45.631
But it might get a little tight once
the rest of my luggage arrives.

11:45.808 --> 11:47.799
I think you're missing
the whole point of this.

11:47.977 --> 11:49.638
We're supposed to be
at one with nature.

11:49.812 --> 11:52.337
Well,
I'm sitting on 50 yards of leather.

11:52.514 --> 11:54.414
What could be
more natural than that?

11:55.117 --> 11:57.779
Only 23 hours
and 49 minutes left to go.

12:00.756 --> 12:02.189
Hello?

12:02.358 --> 12:05.088
Wow, great reception up here.

12:05.260 --> 12:08.195
And each minute
more excruciating than the last.

12:11.066 --> 12:12.465
Sabrina, is there a problem?

12:12.635 --> 12:16.469
No, no problem. The world's
just a big scary place, is all.

12:16.939 --> 12:20.033
No, no, there will be
no street crossing on my watch.

12:20.209 --> 12:22.734
Oh, but, Mom, all the other kids
are allowed to cross the street.

12:22.911 --> 12:25.243
If all the other kids wanted
to jump off a cliff would you...

12:25.414 --> 12:27.075
Look, I just want you to be safe.

12:28.717 --> 12:30.878
I gotta watch what I say.
Hey, looks like rain.

12:34.123 --> 12:36.887
<i>- That was very Looney Tunes.
- Sabrina, what is with the umbrella?</i>

12:37.059 --> 12:39.323
- It's a beautiful day.
- You know what?

12:39.495 --> 12:41.019
It is a beautiful day.

12:43.032 --> 12:45.660
It's a beautiful day, I've thwarted you
three times. Count them.

12:45.834 --> 12:47.995
French fry in the gullet,
ninja death stars to the head,

12:48.170 --> 12:49.467
safe falling from the sky, ha.

12:49.638 --> 12:51.663
<i>You lose, I win
You lose, I win</i>

12:51.840 --> 12:53.034
<i>You can't kill my boyfriend now</i>

12:53.208 --> 12:55.676
- Whoo-hoo.
- You're never gonna believe this.

12:55.844 --> 12:58.278
I'm the new head of A & R
for Warner Records in Los Angeles.

12:58.447 --> 13:00.847
- You're moving to L. A?
- Yeah, and I start tomorrow.

13:01.016 --> 13:02.574
- But what about...?
- Shh.

13:03.118 --> 13:06.815
Maybe we can't kill him, but good luck
with that long-distance thing.

13:06.989 --> 13:08.217
You're breaking us up?

13:10.459 --> 13:12.222
You lose, we win.

13:12.394 --> 13:16.091
<i>You lose, we win, you lose, we win
You lose, we win</i>

13:16.265 --> 13:18.426
You lose. Whoo-hoo.

13:20.202 --> 13:21.533
And through this affirmation,

13:21.704 --> 13:25.105
the trees and mankind will live
in peace and harmony.

13:25.274 --> 13:26.935
And double pepperoni.

13:27.109 --> 13:29.942
Do you mind?
I'm trying to commune with nature.

13:30.112 --> 13:33.741
And I am trying to communicate
with the pizza guy.

13:34.183 --> 13:39.143
Okay, after the fields,
you'll pass some bushes and a creek.

13:39.321 --> 13:43.655
And then, we're sitting on top
of this big, brown and green thingy.

13:49.165 --> 13:52.362
Hey, Sabrina,
what do you think of this?

13:52.535 --> 13:56.232
"Aaron was a good man
with particularly good hair. "

13:56.405 --> 13:57.429
They're not killing him.

13:57.607 --> 14:00.269
The plaid princesses are trying
to break us up by moving him to L.A.

14:00.443 --> 14:01.671
I'm not gonna let that happen.

14:01.844 --> 14:03.812
They're not the only ones
that can do weaving.

14:03.980 --> 14:05.242
Ha, ha. Lots of luck.

14:05.414 --> 14:06.847
You can't even thread a needle.

14:07.016 --> 14:08.881
Maybe not, but you can.

14:09.051 --> 14:10.518
Eh?

14:12.855 --> 14:14.880
Wow, this is the first den of evil

14:15.057 --> 14:16.888
I've ever been in
with pink shag carpeting.

14:17.059 --> 14:21.962
I wish I could say the same.
Oh, man, I miss hanging out with Elvis.

14:22.131 --> 14:24.861
Salem, focus.
We have to find Aaron's tapestry.

14:25.034 --> 14:26.058
Uh...

14:26.235 --> 14:28.533
Is it this one on the loom
with his name on it?

14:28.704 --> 14:29.898
Good focusing.

14:30.072 --> 14:33.098
Oh, look at all the knots.
Poor, Aaron.

14:33.276 --> 14:36.074
When he grows a tail,
I'll throw him a pity party.

14:36.245 --> 14:39.214
But in the meantime,
we've got a little re-weaving to do.

14:39.382 --> 14:41.680
Any chance this is
a weave-by-number?

14:42.051 --> 14:43.916
Well,
I can kiss this manicure goodbye,

14:44.086 --> 14:46.987
but I think
I still got myself a boyfriend.

14:47.156 --> 14:49.181
Sabrina, I've been looking
all over for you.

14:49.358 --> 14:51.849
Guess what.
I'm not moving to Los Angeles after all.

14:52.028 --> 14:53.723
Well, isn't that a shocker?

14:54.697 --> 14:56.062
No. I'm moving to Laos.

14:56.966 --> 15:00.197
Well, now that really is a shocker.
Would you excuse me for a moment?

15:11.247 --> 15:13.044
Sabrina, I've got some bad news.

15:13.216 --> 15:14.843
- You're still moving to Laos?
- No.

15:15.017 --> 15:18.111
But I've been doing some research.
I think I have rickets.

15:33.269 --> 15:34.395
Please tell me you're praying

15:34.570 --> 15:37.198
because you've been cured of rickets
and you're not moving to Laos.

15:37.373 --> 15:39.773
No, I've had an epiphany.

15:39.942 --> 15:41.341
I'm going to join a nunnery.

15:42.778 --> 15:44.473
Your turn.

15:47.850 --> 15:48.874
How's it going?

15:49.051 --> 15:50.780
For a cat who's weaving
with paws on a loom?

15:50.953 --> 15:52.352
Remarkable.

15:53.756 --> 15:55.314
Oh, hi.

15:55.491 --> 15:58.392
Uh. Oh, heh, this isn't Atlantic City.

15:58.561 --> 16:00.859
No wonder
I couldn't find the nickel slots.

16:01.030 --> 16:02.622
Gotta go. Bye.

16:02.798 --> 16:04.857
Get me Sabrina's tapestry.

16:05.034 --> 16:07.059
Now we're really
gonna have some fun.

16:09.472 --> 16:12.339
Huh? Now you've really done it.

16:12.508 --> 16:15.375
"Sabrina was a good woman
with particularly good hair. "

16:15.544 --> 16:17.535
- Hey, it still works.
- Cute.

16:18.914 --> 16:21.246
Weave your way out
of an animal shelter once I'm gone.

16:25.254 --> 16:28.121
Sabrina, listen, before I go to L.A.,

16:28.291 --> 16:30.816
there's something
I wanna talk to you about.

16:30.993 --> 16:32.927
Oh, no.

16:33.095 --> 16:34.858
Here it comes. Okay, I'm ready.

16:35.031 --> 16:36.726
Just make it quick.

16:36.899 --> 16:38.867
You know,
I knew I was gonna ask you this

16:39.035 --> 16:40.502
from the moment
that I first met you,

16:41.203 --> 16:44.263
and I just realized,
what am I waiting for?

16:46.442 --> 16:48.137
Sabrina,

16:48.944 --> 16:50.241
will you marry me?

16:51.681 --> 16:53.615
What? Are you insane?

16:53.783 --> 16:55.080
You don't wanna marry me.

16:55.251 --> 16:57.879
Yes, I do. I love you.

16:58.054 --> 17:00.249
Sabrina, we belong together.
It's fate.

17:00.423 --> 17:05.291
Yeah, you better believe it's fate.
Okay, this is just getting ridiculous.

17:09.231 --> 17:12.200
All right, you little delinquents,
it's recess at St. Brats.

17:12.367 --> 17:13.960
Look, all I did
was save my friend's life

17:14.136 --> 17:16.262
and all you've done since then
is try to ruin mine.

17:16.439 --> 17:19.499
Forcing Aaron to propose makes
a mockery of our entire relationship.

17:19.675 --> 17:21.040
This ends here and now.

17:21.210 --> 17:24.145
Well, aren't you
the little drama queen. Ha, ha.

17:24.579 --> 17:27.174
First of all,
we don't have to ruin your life.

17:27.349 --> 17:29.682
You're an expert at doing that
all by yourself.

17:29.852 --> 17:31.251
Just look at your tapestry.

17:33.723 --> 17:34.917
And second,

17:35.091 --> 17:38.151
we had nothing to do with
Mr. Honey-Man popping the question.

17:38.327 --> 17:39.521
But what about the ring?

17:39.695 --> 17:44.598
Oh, he got that last Thursday.

17:44.767 --> 17:46.667
But that was before
any of this started.

17:46.836 --> 17:47.928
Uh-huh.

17:48.104 --> 17:49.435
So you just sat back
and watched me

17:49.605 --> 17:52.506
destroy the most significant
and special moment of my entire life?

17:52.675 --> 17:55.109
- Oh, yeah. Ha, ha.
- We had popcorn and everything.

17:56.479 --> 18:00.745
Well, that explains the butter
and salt all over my teen years.

18:00.916 --> 18:03.510
- Sure you don't want some pizza?
- No, I don't want some pizza.

18:03.686 --> 18:05.677
I don't want a facial,
and I don't want a manicure,

18:05.855 --> 18:08.380
and I don't want to borrow
your scented buckwheat pillow.

18:08.557 --> 18:09.922
Why not?

18:10.092 --> 18:13.118
Because this is a protest,
not a day at the spa.

18:13.295 --> 18:14.694
I'm protesting.

18:14.864 --> 18:16.422
Hardly.

18:16.599 --> 18:18.794
I don't know
what you are getting so upset about.

18:18.968 --> 18:22.301
You're the one who's always telling me
to think about what's important.

18:22.471 --> 18:24.029
Well,
you know what's important to me?

18:25.841 --> 18:27.934
Having a good time.

18:28.110 --> 18:29.873
Enjoying life.

18:30.045 --> 18:31.706
Just because you're giving back
to society

18:31.881 --> 18:33.212
doesn't mean you have to suffer.

18:33.382 --> 18:35.976
Yes, it does. That's how it's done.

18:36.152 --> 18:37.312
Why?

18:37.486 --> 18:39.716
Well, because it's...

18:39.889 --> 18:41.322
You see...

18:41.857 --> 18:44.189
Oh, just read the newsletter.

18:44.627 --> 18:47.027
Sure you don't want any pizza?

18:47.730 --> 18:49.220
It's veggie.

18:52.268 --> 18:55.135
Well, maybe just one piece.

18:58.274 --> 19:01.539
Salem, is there any chance
that Aaron is just in the other room

19:01.710 --> 19:02.972
laughing over the callous,

19:03.145 --> 19:05.409
uncaring way
I rejected his marriage proposal?

19:05.581 --> 19:08.482
No, but I got a little chuckle out of it.

19:13.722 --> 19:15.986
<i>Flight 892 is now boarding.</i>

19:16.158 --> 19:17.523
<i>All passengers, please proceed...</i>

19:17.693 --> 19:20.287
Hi there. Hi.

19:20.496 --> 19:21.656
Hello, Sabrina.

19:21.831 --> 19:24.698
Aaron, you've got to believe me.
I'm really sorry.

19:24.867 --> 19:27.927
I guess I just didn't think you were
sincere about proposing to me.

19:29.138 --> 19:31.197
What part seemed insincere?

19:31.373 --> 19:32.670
Me offering you the diamond ring,

19:32.842 --> 19:35.310
or getting down on my knees
and bearing my soul?

19:35.878 --> 19:38.142
It's sounding a lot more
sincere now.

19:38.314 --> 19:39.838
Look, I know how you must feel.

19:40.015 --> 19:43.348
You must be totally humiliated,
completely embarrassed...

19:43.519 --> 19:45.953
Yeah, I was there, thanks.

19:47.022 --> 19:49.752
Well,
I just came here to say I love you.

19:49.925 --> 19:54.419
And that I knew we belonged together
the very first moment I saw you.

19:54.597 --> 19:56.622
Now, that sounded sincere.

19:57.032 --> 19:58.829
You should've heard it
when I said it.

19:59.568 --> 20:01.001
Would you mind if we?

20:04.006 --> 20:05.564
You know, and for the record,

20:05.741 --> 20:08.107
if you ever felt
like proposing to me again,

20:08.277 --> 20:11.178
I could pretty much guarantee
that my answer would be different.

20:11.347 --> 20:14.373
And you wouldn't even have
to have the ring with you.

20:17.086 --> 20:19.884
But if you did,
that would be nice too.

20:21.624 --> 20:25.924
You know, some people
might call me an idiot, I don't care.

20:28.964 --> 20:32.024
Hey, idiot, you're kneeling in gum.

20:32.201 --> 20:33.964
And I don't care.

20:34.637 --> 20:37.299
- Sabrina, will you...?
- Yes.

20:37.473 --> 20:38.735
Wait for me to finish.

20:39.775 --> 20:42.005
Sorry. Right, right. Please go on.

20:43.379 --> 20:45.142
Sabrina...

20:45.314 --> 20:48.147
- Will be marry me?
- Yes.

20:50.686 --> 20:53.177
Oh, this is how
I always pictured it would be.

20:53.355 --> 20:55.050
What, being proposed to
in a crowded airport

20:55.224 --> 20:57.124
by a guy with gum on his pants?

20:57.293 --> 20:59.853
No, being proposed to by you.

21:00.029 --> 21:01.360
The gum is just a nice touch.

21:09.405 --> 21:11.305
Okay, guys, shift's over.

21:11.473 --> 21:13.134
Oh, no, we're not going anywhere.

21:13.309 --> 21:15.038
We are committed
to this big old tree.

21:15.210 --> 21:16.336
And having fun doing it.

21:16.512 --> 21:19.072
There's nothing that could possibly
get us to leave this tree.

21:19.748 --> 21:22.649
- Guess what. I'm getting married!
- We're out of here.
