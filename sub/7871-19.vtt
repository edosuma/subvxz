00:40.159 --> 00:42.577
There were some awesome dresses!

00:42.611 --> 00:46.030
And quite a few...
(singsong): disasters!

00:46.065 --> 00:48.016
Fine. What would
you get rid of?

00:48.050 --> 00:50.518
Well, I can't part with
a single one of my <i>Hoarders,</i>

00:50.553 --> 00:52.771

00:54.807 --> 00:56.191

00:56.225 --> 00:58.760
Oh, fine. I'll just get rid of
these <i>Itchy and Mitchys.</i>

00:59.945 --> 01:02.147
For every one of my
cartoons that you erase,

01:02.181 --> 01:03.965

01:10.840 --> 01:13.374
At least I can delete
these Westminster Dog Shows.

01:13.409 --> 01:14.559
(growls)

01:14.593 --> 01:15.994
Fine. I'm getting rid of

Something important.

01:37.550 --> 01:39.851

the Padres or the Tigers?

01:39.885 --> 01:41.653
I'm not talking about baseball.

01:41.687 --> 01:44.906
I'm asking if a priest can beat
a big cat in a death match

01:44.940 --> 01:46.441
in some kind of polygon.

01:46.492 --> 01:47.792
Hexa or octa?

01:47.827 --> 01:51.763
Only one way to decide:
arm wrestling.

01:51.797 --> 01:52.997
Eh, who am I kidding?

01:53.032 --> 01:54.499

09:58.282 --> 10:00.116
Aw, come on.

10:00.150 --> 10:01.718
Five seconds to slip-off.

10:01.752 --> 10:02.852
And four, three...

10:02.886 --> 10:05.421
Boy, what are you
doing up here?!

10:05.456 --> 10:07.790
Also, what am I doing up here?

10:07.825 --> 10:10.793
Bart, you said your grandfather
wouldn't bother us.

10:10.828 --> 10:12.228
I gave him a caramel.

10:12.263 --> 10:14.047
He should have been chewing
for hours.

10:14.081 --> 10:15.348
I couldn't unwrap it!

10:15.382 --> 10:16.349
(yells)

10:16.383 --> 10:17.767
I got you, Grampa!

10:17.801 --> 10:20.386
Hold, bolo, hold!

10:20.420 --> 10:21.771
I don't want to die!

10:21.805 --> 10:23.856
I want to still be a burden!

10:25.142 --> 10:27.193
(yelling)

10:27.227 --> 10:27.944
(all gasp)

10:33.784 --> 10:35.418
Please be okay.

10:35.452 --> 10:40.323
♪ How deep is your love?
How deep is your love? ♪

10:40.357 --> 10:41.391
Boy?

10:41.425 --> 10:42.625
Yes, Grampa?!

10:42.660 --> 10:44.594
Kiss my forehead.

10:44.628 --> 10:46.396
(groans)

10:48.415 --> 10:50.483
Man, I must real love him.

10:57.041 --> 10:59.342
I'm not gonna die today.

10:59.376 --> 11:01.127
Aw, that's so sweet.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.628
Let's get all
our grandfathers

11:02.663 --> 11:04.130
and chuck them
down this thing.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.732
All right!
All right!

11:10.636 --> 11:12.020
Why am I in the basement?

11:12.071 --> 11:13.688
Shouldn't I see a medico?

11:13.739 --> 11:15.523
If the Wilsons' calf
is birthed,

11:15.557 --> 11:17.475
Doc Miller
should be available.

11:17.493 --> 11:19.877
Thank God your mental powers
haven't deteriorated.

11:19.912 --> 11:21.763
Well, why the hell
am I down here?!

11:21.797 --> 11:23.798
I was supposed to be
in charge of you.

11:23.832 --> 11:25.983
I can't let Mom and
Dad know what I did.

11:26.001 --> 11:27.585
But I promise I'll
take good care of you

11:27.620 --> 11:28.953
until you're well again.

11:28.987 --> 11:30.738
No deal!
I'm getting out of here.

11:30.773 --> 11:31.756
(groans)

11:31.790 --> 11:33.207
Ooh, wow.

11:33.242 --> 11:35.109
My tailbone!

11:35.144 --> 11:37.478
And it was my last good bone.

11:37.513 --> 11:38.947
(groans)

11:38.981 --> 11:40.949
There, there,
you'll be fine.

11:40.983 --> 11:42.817
I'll take care of
everything you need.

11:42.851 --> 11:44.585
I want a foot rub.

11:44.620 --> 11:46.421
Yes, but do
you <i>need</i> one?

11:46.455 --> 11:47.922
Nobody needs one!

11:47.957 --> 11:49.090
Now start rubbing!

11:49.124 --> 11:50.174
(groans)

11:50.209 --> 11:51.609
Rub harder!

11:53.412 --> 11:54.696
(humming)

11:57.316 --> 11:58.850
(grunts)
Sorry, pal.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.451
"Sorry, pal"?

12:00.486 --> 12:01.869
Hey, that's common courtesy.

12:01.904 --> 12:03.705
The kind I've only seen
in movies.

12:03.739 --> 12:05.740
This suit is amazing!

12:07.743 --> 12:09.527
Eh, this dump is too filthy

12:09.561 --> 12:11.913
for a man
with a positive worldview.

12:11.947 --> 12:14.599
I'm gonna start cleaning.

12:14.633 --> 12:15.917
Dirt.

12:15.968 --> 12:16.918
Carpet.

12:16.969 --> 12:18.136
Another layer of dirt.

12:18.170 --> 12:19.170
Congoleum.

12:19.204 --> 12:20.138
(gasps)

12:20.172 --> 12:21.339
Hardwood!

12:21.373 --> 12:24.475
The perfect floor
for doing a happy jig.

12:25.177 --> 12:27.161
(upbeat music playing)

12:33.902 --> 12:36.504
And now to light up the sign
and let the world know

12:36.538 --> 12:39.173
that the new, improved Moe's
is open for business.

12:44.546 --> 12:45.513
Hmm.

12:45.547 --> 12:47.048
Wow, non-losers?

12:47.082 --> 12:49.000
Huh, I never thought
I'd see the day.

12:49.034 --> 12:50.985
Gentlemen,
what can I get you?

12:51.020 --> 12:53.321
We'll take anything you've got
aged 15 years or more.

12:53.355 --> 12:55.573
Hmm.

12:56.575 --> 12:57.959
Hmm.

12:58.677 --> 13:00.344
(squeaking)

13:00.379 --> 13:04.165
Well, actually, I do have this
bourbon that I brewed myself.

13:04.199 --> 13:06.234
It'll either be
the best thing you ever had

13:06.268 --> 13:08.236
or the last thing
you'll ever have.

13:08.270 --> 13:09.170
Mmm.
Huh.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.644
Wow! Hey, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

13:16.678 --> 13:17.979
Moe, we're venture
capitalists.

13:18.013 --> 13:20.248
We turn dreams into money
that mostly goes to us,

13:20.282 --> 13:21.499
but you get a little.

13:21.533 --> 13:22.483
Tell me more!

13:22.518 --> 13:23.785
How many
bottles of this

13:23.819 --> 13:25.236
Kentucky Kool-Aid
do you have?

13:25.270 --> 13:26.888
Just the one,
but I could whip up

13:26.922 --> 13:28.689
two or 300,000 more.

13:28.724 --> 13:30.725
Moe, you got a great product,
a fantastic suit,

13:30.759 --> 13:32.593
and we're gonna give you
everything you need.

13:32.628 --> 13:34.912
Startup money,
branding specialists.

13:34.947 --> 13:36.748
Corporate jets,
private drivers.

13:36.782 --> 13:39.016
If your feet touch the ground,
we've failed.

13:39.051 --> 13:40.818
This is all so sudden.

13:43.021 --> 13:45.189
Now it's not.
I'm in!

13:45.224 --> 13:47.191
Only one more thing
we need to do.

13:47.226 --> 13:49.060
Check this out with
our focus group.

13:58.987 --> 13:59.954
So, what do we think?

13:59.988 --> 14:00.955
Be honest, now.

14:00.989 --> 14:02.256
I love it!

14:02.291 --> 14:03.658
I've made a lot of mistakes,

14:03.692 --> 14:05.426
but liking this
ain't one of them.

14:07.112 --> 14:08.813
(groans)

14:08.831 --> 14:11.482
Every time I call
Grampa's phone, I get no answer.

14:11.517 --> 14:15.069
Uh, he told me he was gonna
nap most of the week.

14:15.104 --> 14:16.637
Oh! Oh, good.

14:16.672 --> 14:19.123
Well, he needs his sleep.

14:22.277 --> 14:23.978
Time for your meds!

14:25.347 --> 14:26.147
Come on, blue!
Come on, pink!

14:26.181 --> 14:27.498
Come on, come
on, come on!

14:27.516 --> 14:29.417
Take it, take it,
there you go, yes!

14:29.451 --> 14:33.571
After a pulse-pounding race,
hypertension pills win again.

14:33.605 --> 14:36.040
Call me crazy, but I can't stop
betting on dementia.

14:36.074 --> 14:37.141
(chuckles)

14:37.176 --> 14:40.077
Now, what say we turn
the hot water on and off

14:40.112 --> 14:42.063
while your father's
taking a shower?

14:42.097 --> 14:43.764
HOMER:
(gasps) Oh!

14:43.799 --> 14:44.765
(gasping)

14:44.800 --> 14:46.667
Hot, oh!
Cold, oh!

14:46.702 --> 14:47.835
(screams)

14:47.870 --> 14:49.504
Thank God I'm not
in the shower!

14:49.538 --> 14:51.973
(both laughing)

14:55.477 --> 14:57.145
Hmm.

14:57.179 --> 14:59.680
Grampa, we've been spending
so much time together,

14:59.715 --> 15:02.416
I almost feel like you're
part of the family.

15:02.451 --> 15:03.851
Aw.

15:03.886 --> 15:04.952
And I've been wondering.

15:04.987 --> 15:06.787
Not like I miss
having my afternoons free

15:06.822 --> 15:10.691
or anything, but...
are you starting to feel better?

15:10.726 --> 15:12.160
Absolutely not!

15:12.194 --> 15:15.163
My crotch is crotchety,
sitting down makes me uppity,

15:15.197 --> 15:17.498
and you call
these cups pleated?!

15:17.533 --> 15:19.133
Okay, okay, just checking.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.168
(sighs)

15:20.202 --> 15:22.653
"Dear She-Done-Left-Me Records,

Sonny Rollins?

15:37.169 --> 15:38.569
That's right, Lisa.

15:38.604 --> 15:42.406
And I'm here to beg you to
stop writing those letters.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.976
You're siding
with record companies?

15:45.010 --> 15:46.677
This isn't about
money, Lisa.

15:46.712 --> 15:49.814
From Tupac Shakur to
Dwight Eisenhower,

15:49.848 --> 15:53.150
holograms have introduced some
of our leading dead people

15:53.185 --> 15:55.887
to a new audience of
people with money.

15:55.921 --> 15:58.206
Resetting, resetting.

15:58.240 --> 16:01.475
From Tupac Shakur to
Dwight Eisenhower...

16:01.510 --> 16:02.910
You're a hologram, aren't you?

16:02.945 --> 16:03.945
No.

16:03.979 --> 16:05.763
Resetting, resetting.

16:05.797 --> 16:07.915
(groans)

16:07.950 --> 16:09.667
Have you no shame?!

16:09.701 --> 16:11.102
Does this answer your question?

16:11.136 --> 16:12.136
(man beatboxing)

16:12.170 --> 16:13.437
(rapping):
♪ My name is Princess Di

♪ And I'm here to say

16:14.907 --> 16:17.491
♪ When I watch a DVD,

Take it, Gandhi!

16:18.543 --> 16:20.611
First Bank of Springfield--

16:20.629 --> 16:24.281
say "Mumbai"
to high checking fees!

16:24.299 --> 16:25.783
(hisses)

16:28.470 --> 16:30.421
MOE:
Hey, thanks, guys.

16:30.455 --> 16:33.658
I ain't never been to
no fancy rooftop party before.

16:33.692 --> 16:34.825
No beer?

16:34.860 --> 16:37.028
That's a pretty big screwup.

16:37.062 --> 16:38.629
Moe, we got
a special surprise.

16:38.647 --> 16:40.097
You like chicks
with nose clips?

16:40.131 --> 16:41.232
Then you're really
gonna be happy.

16:41.266 --> 16:43.267
Bring it, girls.

16:46.154 --> 16:49.023
Hey, that is the most accurate
picture of my face

16:49.074 --> 16:51.025
made of girl-parts
that I have ever seen.

16:51.059 --> 16:53.377
And it's not decadent 'cause you
can ask interns to do anything.

16:53.412 --> 16:54.973
Thanks. Thank you so much,
Ken and Glen.

16:54.997 --> 16:56.280
Ah, you're welcome.

16:56.315 --> 16:58.282
Anything to celebrate
your I.P.O. tomorrow.

16:58.316 --> 16:59.617
You know what
that is, right?

16:59.651 --> 17:00.851
Um...

17:00.886 --> 17:01.869
Moe, we love your whiskey,

17:01.920 --> 17:03.004
we love your backstory,

17:03.038 --> 17:04.955
and we love that suit
that hangs off you

17:04.990 --> 17:06.290
like silk on
a skeleton.

17:06.324 --> 17:08.376
So, starting tomorrow,
we're gonna sell shares

17:08.426 --> 17:09.827
in your company
to the public.

17:09.845 --> 17:12.096
All you do is show up
at the stock exchange,

17:12.130 --> 17:14.665
ring the bell, and
you'll leave a rich man.

17:14.683 --> 17:16.651
(elevator bell dings)
We'll see you tomorrow.

17:16.685 --> 17:18.970
Enjoy your last night
as a Democrat.

17:20.372 --> 17:22.356
Dang it, my suit's
stuck in the door.

17:24.175 --> 17:25.726
No, no, no!

17:25.777 --> 17:27.895
<i>This building's got 98 floors!</i>

17:27.945 --> 17:29.797
And I'm going down to P-6!

17:29.831 --> 17:31.365
<i>P-6!</i>

17:36.805 --> 17:38.806
(knocking)

17:42.076 --> 17:42.811
Moe?

17:42.812 --> 17:44.212
What are you doing?

17:44.246 --> 17:46.781
Midge, uh, the suit
got a little mussed up.

17:46.816 --> 17:49.617
I-I got to ask you,
is it noticeable?

17:49.652 --> 17:51.553
Thank God
the kids aren't here.

17:51.587 --> 17:52.754
LISA:
I was.

17:54.773 --> 17:56.858
Aw, without my magic suit,
I'm nothing.

17:56.892 --> 17:58.943
The suit wasn't magic, Moe.

17:58.978 --> 18:01.529
Don't you know the story
of Dumbo the elephant?

18:01.564 --> 18:03.565
I didn't go
to movies as a kid.

18:03.599 --> 18:05.900
Spent all my time
at the pierogi factory.

18:05.935 --> 18:08.069
Dab the potato,
fold the dough.

18:08.103 --> 18:10.038
That was my <i>Star Wars.</i>

18:10.072 --> 18:12.991
Well, Dumbo had
a magic feather.

18:13.025 --> 18:15.059
He thought he
needed it to fly,

18:15.094 --> 18:17.245
but it turned out
the magic was

18:17.279 --> 18:19.314
in him the
whole time.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.649
So you're saying
Moe is Dumbo,

18:21.684 --> 18:23.551
his bourbon is
the giant ears,

18:23.586 --> 18:26.254
and we're that flock
of racist crows?

18:26.288 --> 18:29.858
The crows weren't racist,
the people who drew them were.

18:29.892 --> 18:31.376
Okay, I get it,
I get it.

18:31.410 --> 18:34.012
It wasn't the suit that made
the bourbon, it was me.

18:34.063 --> 18:35.597
And I can do anything.

18:35.631 --> 18:36.564
Don't stand up!

18:36.599 --> 18:37.699
Except stand up.

18:37.733 --> 18:38.966
BART:
<i>Grampa,</i>

18:38.984 --> 18:40.435
I made your favorite dinner:

18:40.469 --> 18:42.637
teething biscuits
soaked in buttermilk.

18:44.306 --> 18:47.425
(singing
"The Blue Danube" waltz)

18:48.444 --> 18:50.862
Oh! Oh! The pain!

18:50.913 --> 18:53.281
(grunting)

18:53.315 --> 18:54.449
You're completely fine!

18:54.483 --> 18:56.050
I've been taking care of you,

18:56.085 --> 18:58.419
giving you love and
attention for nothing!

18:58.454 --> 19:00.421
All right, boy, I admit it.

19:00.456 --> 19:03.992
I've been faking being hurt,
just like I fake

19:04.026 --> 19:07.629
liking those terrible homemade
Christmas gifts you give.

19:07.663 --> 19:09.764
But Mom said it was
a gift made with love.

19:09.798 --> 19:11.032
Did she?

19:11.066 --> 19:12.033
No.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.568
Even she thought it was crap.

19:13.602 --> 19:15.770
But what you did
wasn't for nothing.

19:15.804 --> 19:18.072
It was the best two weeks

19:18.107 --> 19:20.875
of this final horrible
part of my life.

19:20.910 --> 19:24.412
Well, you are the first thing
I took care of that didn't die.

19:24.446 --> 19:27.415
(chuckles):
Oh, I hear that a lot.

19:28.651 --> 19:30.251
Hey-ya, guys.

19:30.286 --> 19:32.737
Security, there's
a homeless monster up here!

19:32.771 --> 19:34.656
Hey-hey-hey, I'm
your partner, Moe.

19:35.858 --> 19:37.742
N-Now, let's go make
us a fortune, huh?

19:37.793 --> 19:38.760
(bell tolling)

19:38.794 --> 19:40.762
(all gasp)
Look!

19:40.796 --> 19:44.365
It's Quasimodo
without the pathos!

19:44.400 --> 19:45.500
People, please, please.

19:45.534 --> 19:46.884
My name is Moe Szyslak

19:46.919 --> 19:50.288
of Makers Moe Bourbon,
ticker symbol: M-O-E.

19:50.322 --> 19:53.458
I'm the CEO, and I promise
that I will hand-brew

19:53.492 --> 19:56.494
every bottle
with these very hands, huh?

19:56.528 --> 19:58.963
I-I'll supervise production,
I'll manage marketing.

19:58.998 --> 20:01.683
My face is gonna be
on every bottle!

20:01.717 --> 20:04.118
And we will only use
the finest ingredients

20:04.153 --> 20:05.753
made in America.

20:05.788 --> 20:07.188
(booing, clamoring)

20:09.992 --> 20:11.592
Glad you're back, Moe.

20:11.627 --> 20:14.629
At least I don't have to
train the new bartender

20:14.663 --> 20:17.849
to make what I like--
beer to the top.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.518
(humming)

20:20.552 --> 20:22.120
(sighs)

20:39.572 --> 20:41.039
Not today, old friend.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.441
But don't worry, holidays are
just around the corner.
