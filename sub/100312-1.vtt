WEBVTT

00:25.350 --> 00:26.986
<i>Get me in ten minutes, Ray.</i>

00:28.087 --> 00:29.088
<i>Boss.</i>

00:44.536 --> 00:46.571
- Bobby.
- Boss?

00:47.472 --> 00:49.474
I'll have a pint
and a pickled egg.

00:50.009 --> 00:51.144
Coming straight up.

01:22.407 --> 01:25.044
<i>If you wish to be
the king of the jungle,</i>

01:25.178 --> 01:27.412
<i>it's not enough
to act like a king.</i>

01:30.315 --> 01:31.918
<i>You must be the king.</i>

01:33.186 --> 01:34.854
<i>And there can be no doubt.</i>

01:35.988 --> 01:40.059
Because doubt causes chaos
and one's own demise.

01:51.403 --> 01:52.471
Hello, my love.

01:53.338 --> 01:54.606
It's date night tonight.

01:54.941 --> 01:56.943
Nine o'clock,
you and I, River Cafe.

02:01.214 --> 02:02.514
Who's there?

02:04.249 --> 02:05.617
Ros, who's there?

04:35.167 --> 04:36.468
Chink, chink.

04:43.175 --> 04:44.176
Fletcher.

04:44.777 --> 04:47.780
<i>Buenas tardes, Raymondo.</i>

04:47.914 --> 04:51.616
I should stab you with
that fucking rolling pin.

04:51.751 --> 04:55.755
Oh, don't be cunty. I was just hoping we
could have a cozy little drink together.

04:56.222 --> 05:00.760
So, I've got a meeting on Saturday
at your favorite newspaper.

05:01.861 --> 05:06.299
As the best private investigator
in this smoky little town...

05:06.431 --> 05:08.566
good evening,
ladies and gentlemen...

05:08.701 --> 05:12.872
they are ready to put 150 grand in
my pocket to give them some filth.

05:13.005 --> 05:15.308
Good for me, that,
but in this case...

05:17.043 --> 05:18.244
it's bad for you.

05:19.779 --> 05:23.382
So Big Dave,
editor extraordinaire,

05:23.515 --> 05:27.320
has developed a terrible
antipathy for your boss

05:27.452 --> 05:30.156
and his liquorish assortment
of tasty mates.

05:30.289 --> 05:35.361
He's out to destroy him and all those
that cozy up to him. Front cover. Bosh!

05:35.493 --> 05:37.997
There will be blood and fucking
feathers everywhere, my darling.

05:38.596 --> 05:41.100
Get to it, Fletcher.
I'm starting to itch.

05:41.233 --> 05:44.170
Now, we both know that your boss has
very, very deep pockets,

05:44.303 --> 05:47.340
and I would like to invite him just
to have a teeny rummage in them.

05:48.941 --> 05:50.676
What the fuck
are you talking about?

05:50.810 --> 05:52.477
If you would be so kind

05:52.610 --> 05:54.113
as to furnish me with
20 million British pounds,

05:54.246 --> 05:55.881
I will give you everything...

05:56.015 --> 05:59.118
memory cards, contact sheets,
recordings, the lot,

05:59.251 --> 06:02.688
and a modest little screenplay
I wrote all by myself.

06:02.822 --> 06:03.856
Hold on.

06:04.589 --> 06:08.027
We just went from Â£150,000
to 20 million.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.329
That's a steep rise
in 30 seconds.

06:10.463 --> 06:13.299
Yeah, but I would argue that you're
lucky, because that is nothing

06:13.432 --> 06:17.136
compared to what I could,
and perhaps should, be asking.

06:17.269 --> 06:20.206
Oh, well, thank God
you're not greedy, Fletcher,

06:20.339 --> 06:22.708
you deluded,
shit-eating cunt.

06:24.677 --> 06:26.679
I quite like it
when you talk dirty to me.

06:27.880 --> 06:30.082
I can feel myself engorging.

06:30.850 --> 06:33.252
Come on, have a drink with me.
It's really yummy.

06:33.719 --> 06:37.023
I looked it up. App-ed it.
1500 quid?

06:37.156 --> 06:39.759
I didn't know you could spend
that much on a bottle of scotch.

06:40.626 --> 06:45.331
I'm gonna tell you a story to
demonstrate why my quote is my quote.

06:46.598 --> 06:48.300
Will you play a game
with me, Ray?

06:49.502 --> 06:51.003
I don't wanna play a game.

06:51.771 --> 06:54.507
- Please?
- No.

06:54.940 --> 06:57.009
I said play a fucking game
with me, Ray.

07:05.718 --> 07:06.786
Right.

07:07.253 --> 07:08.354
Lovely.

07:08.854 --> 07:12.358
Now, I want you
to imagine a character,

07:12.491 --> 07:15.761
a dramatic character,
like in a book or a play or a film.

07:15.895 --> 07:18.497
But not digital,
not on a memory stick.

07:18.631 --> 07:22.068
Analog. Chemical process.
"Keep the grain in the picture," I say.

07:22.201 --> 07:23.702
Old-school, 35 mill.

07:28.674 --> 07:30.409
Now, I'm seeing this
through a lens, I am,

07:30.543 --> 07:32.311
and I'm not talking about
the small screen.

07:32.445 --> 07:34.046
It's not TV, Raymond.

07:34.180 --> 07:37.049
As I said,
old-school cinema format.

07:37.183 --> 07:40.986
It's what we in the business called
anamorphic, or ratio 2.35 to 1.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.889
And I want you to join me
on this cinematic journey,

07:44.023 --> 07:45.791
'cause it is cinema, Ray.

07:45.925 --> 07:48.894
It's beautiful,
beautiful cinema.

07:49.829 --> 07:52.364
Now, roll camera.

07:54.567 --> 07:56.902
<i>Enter our protagonist.</i>

07:57.036 --> 07:59.205
<i>He's good-looking,
he's gorgeous,</i>

07:59.338 --> 08:02.607
<i>he's golden age,
he's a proper handsome cunt.</i>

08:02.741 --> 08:06.245
<i>His name is Mickey Pearson.</i>

08:06.779 --> 08:08.914
Unique background
has our Mickey.

08:09.048 --> 08:13.786
<i>American born, Rhodes scholar,
so he's born clever but poor.</i>

08:13.919 --> 08:16.589
<i>Now, that's quite a leap from
a trailer park in Americana</i>

08:16.722 --> 08:19.624
<i>to the thousand-year-old</i>
<i>university in old</i> Angleterre,

08:19.758 --> 08:23.129
<i>where he studies
the dark art of horticulture.</i>

08:23.262 --> 08:26.332
But he never finished his education,
never went home, because...

08:26.465 --> 08:28.634
<i>he found his vocation.</i>

08:28.767 --> 08:30.069
<i>A naughty vocation.</i>

08:30.903 --> 08:32.438
<i>He's a bad boy.</i>

08:32.571 --> 08:35.174
<i>He starts dealing
the dirty wonder weed</i>

08:35.307 --> 08:38.477
<i>to his rich, British,
upper-class uni pals</i>

08:38.611 --> 08:40.946
<i>and realizes
he's rather good at it.</i>

08:41.080 --> 08:43.849
<i>He's clear and objective
about ambition</i>

08:43.982 --> 08:47.486
<i>and he can surf the echelons
of our complicated culture.</i>

08:48.921 --> 08:52.358
<i>He knew how to take advantage
of his advantage.</i>

08:54.360 --> 08:56.028
<i>He was a hungry animal,
you see.</i>

08:56.162 --> 08:59.165
<i>He was powerful and ruthless,
cunning and quick,</i>

08:59.298 --> 09:01.667
<i>charismatic and smart, but...</i>

09:01.800 --> 09:04.537
<i>he had to do some naughty
things to get where he got,</i>

09:04.670 --> 09:06.305
<i>to establish his position,</i>

09:06.438 --> 09:09.074
<i>to show he wasn't just
teeth, tits and tan.</i>

09:10.009 --> 09:12.011
Well, he wasn't
fucking hollow, was he?

09:14.914 --> 09:16.448
<i>He had an engine
under his hood</i>

09:16.582 --> 09:18.984
<i>and a gun in his holster.</i>

09:21.420 --> 09:23.889
So, he's not exactly clean,
our Mickey.

09:24.023 --> 09:25.791
He has come up the hard way.

09:25.925 --> 09:28.527
He's earned his position,
shall we say.

09:28.662 --> 09:30.362
<i>Well, that was the early days,</i>

09:30.496 --> 09:33.532
<i>and he cracked on with
his New World pioneer spirit.</i>

09:34.233 --> 09:37.836
What's he worth today?
100, 200, 500 million?

09:37.970 --> 09:40.573
But now the plot
begins to thicken.

09:40.706 --> 09:43.275
He has reached
a crossroads in his life.

09:43.409 --> 09:45.711
The middle class and the middle
age, they've got to him.

09:45.844 --> 09:49.381
They've corrupted his appetite
for the horrors. He's gone soft.

09:49.515 --> 09:52.384
He wanted to cash in his chips
and get out of the game,

09:52.518 --> 09:55.087
and he seems to have found
the perfect customer.

09:55.221 --> 09:56.555
Smash cut, please...

09:57.056 --> 09:59.058
<i>to interior, a gala dinner.</i>

09:59.191 --> 10:02.127
Just a few words to say
thank you to Michael Pearson

10:02.261 --> 10:04.730
for his limitless generosity
and time.

10:04.863 --> 10:09.335
<i>Now, Mickey has been cultivating
a special relationship</i>

10:09.468 --> 10:13.739
<i>with the erudite, learned and
broad-minded Matthew Berger.</i>

10:13.872 --> 10:17.243
Yes, Raymond, I do know about
the Jewish billionaire cowboy,

10:17.376 --> 10:20.446
another slice of Americana
creating drama in <i>Angleterre.</i>

10:20.579 --> 10:24.583
And finally to Matthew Berger
blindsiding us with his donation

10:24.718 --> 10:27.886
to build the entire cognitive
behavioral therapy unit.

10:28.387 --> 10:30.724
<i>So these two have met before.
Fuck knows where.</i>

10:30.856 --> 10:34.793
<i>Presumably at the annual international
drug dealers convention in Las Vegas.</i>

10:34.927 --> 10:36.996
<i>And they've done
some small deals together,</i>

10:37.129 --> 10:39.465
<i>but now they're ready
for the big one.</i>

10:39.598 --> 10:42.368
Well, that was unexpected,
Matthew.

10:43.068 --> 10:45.304
Now I understand why you're
seated at the head of the table.

10:45.437 --> 10:48.073
Snuck that one right by me, didn't
you, you naughty little girl?

10:48.440 --> 10:50.476
Making a splash
with the gentry.

10:50.609 --> 10:53.178
Oh, I like to make a splash
whenever possible.

10:53.647 --> 10:57.449
Well, you also seem to understand
the significance of a proper attire.

10:57.583 --> 10:58.984
Indeed I do.

10:59.118 --> 11:00.419
I believe
a sense of ownership

11:00.552 --> 11:02.254
is vital
in every aspect of life,

11:02.388 --> 11:04.758
perhaps never more so than
when it comes to wardrobe.

11:04.890 --> 11:08.594
For every look there is a season,
and for every season a strategy.

11:08.728 --> 11:11.130
<i>Now starts the alpha dance.</i>

11:11.263 --> 11:12.898
<i>They're not really talking
about clothes, Raymond.</i>

11:13.032 --> 11:14.634
<i>Oh, fucking no.</i>

11:14.768 --> 11:16.435
<i>They're like
a pair of old doggies</i>

11:16.568 --> 11:19.004
<i>sniffing round one another's
intellectual assholes.</i>

11:19.138 --> 11:21.807
<i>It's a good old-fashioned
cock-off, Raymond.</i>

11:21.940 --> 11:24.644
Michael, I'm looking forward
to doing business together.

11:25.144 --> 11:27.613
- May we excuse ourselves?
- Yes, please.

11:28.547 --> 11:30.349
We should say good night
to our host.

11:35.254 --> 11:36.588
So what do you think?

11:37.156 --> 11:38.692
I'm not sure.

11:38.824 --> 11:39.825
Your Grace.

11:39.958 --> 11:41.360
He's a fox,

11:41.493 --> 11:43.162
and foxes
have a predictable nature.

11:43.295 --> 11:45.064
Trust this Jew
about that Jew.

11:45.197 --> 11:46.666
If you let him
in the henhouse,

11:46.800 --> 11:48.668
you can expect blood
and feathers everywhere.

11:49.803 --> 11:52.304
Fresh from
a farmyard pheasant shoot,

11:52.438 --> 11:55.174
these two are starting
to like each other.

11:55.307 --> 11:57.843
It's looking good, Ray.
It's looking fucking good.

11:57.976 --> 12:00.579
I'm impressed with what you've done with your enterprise.

12:00.714 --> 12:02.848
You see, try as I might,
I can't work out how you do it,

12:02.981 --> 12:04.751
and bush is my game.

12:04.883 --> 12:07.386
How does anyone grow
50 tons of super skunk

12:07.519 --> 12:09.421
without letting anyone else
know how they do it?

12:09.555 --> 12:11.957
I'm flattered to hear that
from you, Matthew.

12:12.091 --> 12:14.493
I imagine that big brain of yours
is sweating a stream of tears

12:14.627 --> 12:16.195
just trying
to figure it out.

12:16.328 --> 12:17.797
Brilliance
should be acknowledged.

12:17.930 --> 12:18.997
Mm.

12:19.131 --> 12:20.866
Run the numbers
by me again.

12:20.999 --> 12:24.570
200 million gross p.a.,
100 million net.

12:24.704 --> 12:26.138
But your people
know this already.

12:26.271 --> 12:28.340
They've swept the numbers
for months now.

12:28.474 --> 12:32.378
The bottom line is I'll sell
it to you for 400 million.

12:38.984 --> 12:41.286
But you knew that already.
Hop in.

12:41.420 --> 12:44.056
<i>Now, I can't be specific
about the heroes and zeros,</i>

12:44.189 --> 12:46.626
but there was a lot of money
hanging in the balance.

12:46.760 --> 12:50.262
Question: What would it be
worth to have the power

12:50.396 --> 12:52.965
to be able to pull the plug
on an operation like that?

12:53.098 --> 12:57.202
Answer: A greedy man would
want half the sale price,

12:57.336 --> 13:00.372
but a smart man would know
that 20 million pounds

13:00.506 --> 13:03.909
was just about uncomfortable enough
to make everyone feel comfortable.

13:04.610 --> 13:07.647
You're a cunning and creative
toad, aren't you, Fletcher,

13:07.781 --> 13:09.615
coming up
with a plan like this?

13:09.749 --> 13:11.651
Yeah, but I didn't really
come up with it, did I?

13:11.785 --> 13:13.252
It was Big Dave.

13:13.385 --> 13:15.020
He commissioned me
to do a job on Mickey,

13:15.154 --> 13:16.689
you know, sniff about,
keep an eye on him,

13:16.823 --> 13:18.758
go through his bins,
reveal his sins.

13:19.391 --> 13:23.595
Mickey Pearson, the odious Yankee gangster.
We're gonna bury him.

13:23.730 --> 13:27.533
Because it seems he's got himself
a new friend. Lord Pressfield.

13:27.667 --> 13:30.602
Question:
Is that the Lord Pressfield?

13:30.936 --> 13:32.304
<i>His Grace, the duke?</i>

13:32.438 --> 13:35.073
Yeah. Once fourth in line
to the throne.

13:35.207 --> 13:36.776
Apparently Mickey Pearson
has squeaked his way

13:36.910 --> 13:39.211
into the crack
of his fat, posh ass.

13:40.379 --> 13:43.817
This is yours, Fletcher. I need a man
with your creativity, with your nose.

13:43.949 --> 13:45.652
Now, you know
you're my favorite bloodhound.

13:45.785 --> 13:47.586
I just think it's really
important to remember

13:47.720 --> 13:49.154
who you're talking to, Dave.

13:49.288 --> 13:51.490
Of course I remember,
Fletcher.

13:51.623 --> 13:54.526
So just make absolutely sure the
check doesn't disappoint this time.

13:55.427 --> 13:57.329
The number is 150,000.

13:57.664 --> 14:00.365
He wants to ruin him,

14:00.499 --> 14:03.435
but I am here
to do you a favor.

14:04.671 --> 14:07.339
And it's not like you're not
getting something for your money.

14:07.473 --> 14:10.609
You could even turn that script
into a feature film, Raymond.

14:11.176 --> 14:14.379
We could make it together.
We could be partners.

14:15.113 --> 14:16.850
I have learned off you lot.

14:17.149 --> 14:20.586
You gotta look after number
one, and now it's my turn.

14:21.754 --> 14:25.491
The sun is not going up
for me, Ray. It's going down.

14:26.893 --> 14:29.929
So why has Big Dave
got it in for my boss?

14:30.062 --> 14:32.097
Two months ago,
your man Mickey

14:32.231 --> 14:34.834
<i>made my man Dave feel
like a right fucking idiot.</i>

14:34.968 --> 14:36.836
Henry. Mickey.

14:36.970 --> 14:38.103
How did he do that?

14:38.237 --> 14:39.605
Didn't accept his hand.

14:39.739 --> 14:41.708
- Dave. <i>Daily Print.</i>
- Yes.

14:42.574 --> 14:44.644
No. Editor
of the <i>Daily Print.</i>

14:44.777 --> 14:47.546
<i>Turns out Dave had
gone after one of Mickey's lords,</i>

14:47.680 --> 14:49.581
<i>did a proper tabloid job
on him.</i>

14:49.716 --> 14:51.885
<i>It would appear that His
Lordship had had a quick spin</i>

14:52.017 --> 14:54.253
<i>on one of
his attractive young footmen.</i>

14:54.386 --> 14:56.990
<i>After the splash, shares
crashed, job went, wife followed,</i>

14:57.122 --> 14:59.191
<i>and even his kids
disowned him.</i>

14:59.324 --> 15:01.628
<i>Well, that Dave
can't half be a cunt.</i>

15:02.394 --> 15:04.162
But no one
will pull him on it.

15:04.296 --> 15:06.598
Too fucking scared that Dave
will do a feature on them.

15:06.733 --> 15:09.535
<i>But your Mickey, he's got
a fabulous set of balls.</i>

15:09.669 --> 15:12.839
So he snubbed him in front of a crowd
that Dave could only wish he belonged to.

15:12.972 --> 15:16.208
You know, lords and ladies, the sort that
Mickey feels very comfortable in front of.

15:16.809 --> 15:18.978
Men, excuse us.

15:19.144 --> 15:21.146
<i>Well, he might just as
well have pulled Dave's cock off.</i>

15:21.280 --> 15:23.016
I do believe that was a bit
of a fuck off, Dave.

15:23.148 --> 15:25.117
<i>'Cause he just
fizzled like a party balloon.</i>

15:25.985 --> 15:27.854
That's no reason
to go after a fella.

15:27.987 --> 15:30.657
Well, I don't know what to tell you.
He wants Mickey's blood.

15:30.790 --> 15:34.259
And he would be getting it
too, if it wasn't for...

15:35.294 --> 15:38.731
You're a filthy fantasist,
and now it's time to leave.

15:38.865 --> 15:42.167
Oh, don't be silly.
I'm only just lubing you up.

15:42.301 --> 15:47.172
Now, there is a reason why Matthew,
or anyone else for that matter,

15:47.306 --> 15:50.275
cannot work out
how Mickey does what he does.

15:50.409 --> 15:54.212
How does he grow 50 tons of white
widow super cheese every year?

15:54.346 --> 15:56.248
Everyone knows
that needs a lot of space.

15:56.381 --> 15:59.786
So where is the space and how
come he's kept it under wraps?

15:59.919 --> 16:03.088
<i>You can't just dig a hole in the ground
and drop 200 shipping containers in there.</i>

16:03.221 --> 16:04.791
<i>Oh, no, my love.
That will not work.</i>

16:04.924 --> 16:08.728
No. You have to be creative.
You need an angle.

16:08.861 --> 16:11.664
The problem with land in this
country is there's not much of it...

16:13.032 --> 16:15.969
and there's public access even
when it's supposed to be private.

16:16.535 --> 16:19.438
And the public have rights:
dog walkers...

16:19.571 --> 16:21.239
Yes, jog on.

16:21.373 --> 16:23.810
<i>...footpaths, right to roam,</i>

16:23.943 --> 16:25.410
<i>bimblers, ramblers,</i>

16:25.544 --> 16:26.980
<i>badger lovers...</i>

16:27.714 --> 16:29.649
<i>...and any other busy cunt
with enough time on his hands</i>

16:29.782 --> 16:31.116
to sniff
the green tweed of England.

16:31.249 --> 16:32.752
Good morning!

16:32.885 --> 16:34.386
And they have groups,

16:34.519 --> 16:38.057
<i>forums, meetings,
social media,</i>

16:38.190 --> 16:40.059
<i>and they love
a good chat and a hiss</i>

16:40.192 --> 16:42.895
about anyone who's decided to
mow his lawn without a license.

16:44.030 --> 16:47.299
And then there's the helicopters,
drones, Google Earth,

16:47.432 --> 16:49.501
<i>heritage sites,
parish councils,</i>

16:49.636 --> 16:51.004
and the beat goes on.

16:51.804 --> 16:54.272
And that's before you even think
about getting power in here.

16:56.643 --> 16:59.679
So what is
Mickey's unique method?

16:59.812 --> 17:04.316
I tip my cap at the cheek,
at the elegance, at the class.

17:05.084 --> 17:07.053
And what would
that method be exactly?

17:07.185 --> 17:09.521
You have to understand
a culture to understand a man.

17:10.188 --> 17:12.025
<i>Toffs, aristocrats,</i>

17:12.156 --> 17:15.127
<i>dukes, duchesses,
lords and ladies,</i>

17:15.260 --> 17:17.130
lots of land
and fuck all dough.

17:17.262 --> 17:21.034
<i>Houses to keep, damp to
keep out, silver to polish.</i>

17:21.165 --> 17:24.169
You must remember
that cash is very persuasive

17:24.301 --> 17:27.707
<i>to the class that got spanked by
angry lefties and death duties.</i>

17:28.975 --> 17:32.544
<i>And every time you inherit a
fortune, you lose half to the state.</i>

17:32.679 --> 17:34.681
<i>So this is my moment to swoop in</i>

17:34.814 --> 17:36.849
<i>like a guardian fucking angel</i>

17:36.983 --> 17:40.385
<i>and offer my services so they
can keep their houses in order.</i>

17:40.519 --> 17:42.655
And they're not too bothered
about what I do,

17:43.122 --> 17:46.224
<i>as long as that cash
keeps rolling in each year.</i>

17:46.358 --> 17:49.128
It's good to get a lord, yes,
but it's not easy.

17:49.261 --> 17:53.066
It takes work,
wine, women and disco.

17:53.633 --> 17:56.401
<i>Twelve sites. Twelve farms.</i>

17:56.535 --> 17:59.438
<i>One thousand of these estates
in the great UK.</i>

17:59.571 --> 18:01.573
<i>Bonne chance</i>
trying to find them all.

18:02.742 --> 18:05.778
That's it. My infrastructure.

18:06.746 --> 18:11.349
And that, sir, is, with my
blessing, what you are paying for.

18:12.217 --> 18:14.787
If it's as discreet and as
lucrative as you claim it is,

18:14.921 --> 18:16.621
I'll buy the whole business.

18:16.923 --> 18:18.590
But enough foreplay, Michael.

18:19.192 --> 18:20.592
I wanna see your plant.

18:22.895 --> 18:24.997
I've gone to great lengths
to make my operation

18:25.131 --> 18:27.667
as invisible as possible,
Matthew.

18:27.800 --> 18:30.235
If you were standing on my
bush, you wouldn't know it.

18:32.370 --> 18:35.842
As a matter of fact,
you are standing on my bush.

18:38.811 --> 18:40.847
It's a spectacular business,
Michael.

18:41.881 --> 18:43.716
Such a shame it will go
bankrupt in ten years

18:43.850 --> 18:45.952
when things go legal
in the great UK.

18:46.585 --> 18:48.921
And you want me
to pay top dollar for it?

18:49.222 --> 18:51.256
A nugget under half a yard?

18:52.524 --> 18:53.726
That is the price.

18:54.727 --> 18:57.496
Now step inside and I'll show
you what half a yard gets you.

19:02.467 --> 19:07.006
Ooh. A delightful tool shed
for 400 million dollars.

19:07.640 --> 19:09.441
Is the ball-peen hammer
included?

19:09.574 --> 19:12.477
Course it is.
Now let me show you the nails.

19:20.485 --> 19:21.586
Watch your head.

19:22.320 --> 19:23.656
Carry on, chaps.

19:34.901 --> 19:37.170
England's
green and pleasant land.

19:39.272 --> 19:40.773
Those are some nails.

19:42.141 --> 19:45.178
Location, staff, technology.

19:46.045 --> 19:49.949
See, you're buying the substructure
for the superstructure to come,

19:50.582 --> 19:54.253
and with purchase you will
inherit the best sites available,

19:54.386 --> 19:57.489
the finest botanists and herb
sommeliers in the world,

19:57.622 --> 20:01.194
as well as the most innovative
marijuana technology on the planet.

20:02.360 --> 20:04.897
And when this little piggy
goes to legal market

20:05.031 --> 20:08.067
and the demand
way outpaces the supply...

20:09.035 --> 20:12.470
these locations,
these green-fingered botanical boys,

20:12.604 --> 20:14.907
as well as
my superior technology,

20:15.041 --> 20:16.341
will be at a premium.

20:17.777 --> 20:19.178
And you would own them all.

20:22.014 --> 20:26.052
Did you know it took 15 years after
alcohol prohibition ended back home

20:26.185 --> 20:28.321
for the legal market
to scratch that itch?

20:29.121 --> 20:30.890
Fifteen years.

20:31.489 --> 20:33.592
And that's if
you do nothing with it.

20:34.293 --> 20:37.029
Yes, it's a win-win,
no matter how you look at it.

20:38.597 --> 20:40.867
And I'm not greedy.
You and I both know

20:41.000 --> 20:44.203
that 400 million is a
fair-to-generous asking price,

20:45.104 --> 20:47.472
especially considering
that once this game's kosher,

20:47.606 --> 20:50.408
it's going to be worth
somewhere between 200 billion

20:50.542 --> 20:53.846
and, well,
half a trillion pounds.

20:54.213 --> 20:55.380
Annually.

20:56.048 --> 20:57.415
Weed.

20:57.549 --> 20:58.751
Bush.

20:59.352 --> 21:00.853
Skunk-amola.

21:01.553 --> 21:03.756
White widow super cheese.

21:05.358 --> 21:06.726
It's the new gold rush.

21:07.894 --> 21:10.863
This is the thin end
of a very fat wedge, sir.

21:11.596 --> 21:14.532
If it's such a fat wedge,
why don't you keep it?

21:15.600 --> 21:19.872
You see, I've developed a reputation
as a man who came up the hard way.

21:20.605 --> 21:23.843
You could say that there's blood
on these pretty white hands.

21:24.844 --> 21:28.781
But in the new business,
once legal and under the jurisdiction

21:28.915 --> 21:32.919
of the respectable umbrella
of ministerial legitimacy,

21:33.052 --> 21:36.722
an enterprise like this will
need a face with a clean past,

21:36.856 --> 21:40.059
which sadly I do not possess.

21:40.192 --> 21:42.295
Retirement
doesn't sound so bad.

21:42.427 --> 21:45.865
Long walks in the countryside,
pruning roses with my better half,

21:45.998 --> 21:47.432
raising some cubs.

21:47.565 --> 21:50.136
I've earned it.

21:50.870 --> 21:54.807
Look, we both know growing
is only 50% of the business.

21:55.607 --> 21:57.575
I need
your European connections.

21:57.710 --> 21:59.912
I've seen
how the sausage is made.

22:00.046 --> 22:01.546
Now tell me
about the butcher shops.

22:02.480 --> 22:04.183
Well, that comes later,
Matthew,

22:04.750 --> 22:06.584
when the money's in escrow.

22:06.719 --> 22:10.022
Now that we've established
the dilemma of our protagonist,

22:10.156 --> 22:13.693
let us turn to our antagonist.

22:13.826 --> 22:16.696
Many miles away,
across the open plains,

22:16.829 --> 22:22.201
another beautiful feral beast
lopes his way to a watering hole.

22:22.335 --> 22:23.601
Who are you talking about
now?

22:23.736 --> 22:27.539
I talk, Raymondo, of Dry Eye.

22:27.673 --> 22:29.175
Oh, Dry Eye.

22:29.308 --> 22:32.044
What is he?
Chinese? Japanese? Pekingese?

22:32.178 --> 22:33.545
Get on your fucking knees?

22:33.679 --> 22:35.480
Dirty dragon filth.

22:35.613 --> 22:38.784
<i>âª Yellow is the color
Gambling is the game âª</i>

22:38.918 --> 22:43.322
He explodes on the scene like a millennial
fucking firecracker. Bang, bang, bang.

22:43.456 --> 22:45.358
You chee-bye motherfuckers!

22:45.490 --> 22:47.460
<i>I'm gonna have to
stop you right there, Fletcher.</i>

22:47.994 --> 22:49.862
That doesn't sound like
the Dry Eye I know.

22:49.996 --> 22:52.465
Just making sure you're
paying attention, Raymond.

22:52.597 --> 22:56.268
So let's cut instead
to a somewhat anticlimactic

22:56.402 --> 22:59.171
<i>but suave and debonair
Dry Eye,</i>

22:59.305 --> 23:01.140
<i>like a Chinese James Bond.</i>

23:02.308 --> 23:04.043
<i>"Ricense" to kill.</i>

23:05.878 --> 23:07.747
- Open them up.
- Yes, boss.

23:12.952 --> 23:14.353
Good Lord.

23:17.189 --> 23:19.925
Hose them down, load them up
and fuck them off.

23:20.059 --> 23:22.828
- Let me have a look at 432.
- Yes, boss. It's just right here.

23:27.967 --> 23:32.171
There's 120 rims, uh,
32 LS engines, 60 custom...

23:32.304 --> 23:34.106
All right. Pay the man.

23:34.240 --> 23:37.977
Sorry, chaps. I quoted you for
a 20 when it's a 40-footer.

23:38.110 --> 23:40.179
It's gonna be double bubble.

23:40.846 --> 23:42.681
Double bubble?

23:44.183 --> 23:47.853
A gentleman's quote
is a gentleman's word.

23:48.988 --> 23:52.725
Now, either you or your family are
gonna have to pay for that lesson.

23:54.460 --> 23:55.995
Do we have an understanding?

23:57.163 --> 23:58.330
Yes, boss.

23:59.632 --> 24:01.400
Give the soppy prick
his money.

24:05.004 --> 24:07.206
<i>Anyway,
let's put a pin in Dry Eye</i>

24:07.339 --> 24:09.208
and turn again to Mickey.

24:09.675 --> 24:11.777
If you're thinking
of smoking that in here...

24:12.545 --> 24:13.479
don't.

24:13.646 --> 24:15.081
I find that confusing.

24:15.214 --> 24:18.451
Do you mean don't smoke
or don't think?

24:22.254 --> 24:23.889
Oh...

24:24.023 --> 24:25.925
Oh, all right, all right,
it's going out.

24:44.777 --> 24:49.415
<i>I think the time has come
for me to introduce you to our queen.</i>

24:49.548 --> 24:50.816
Harold, bag.

24:50.950 --> 24:52.718
<i>A Cockney Cleopatra</i>

24:52.852 --> 24:54.787
<i>to Mickey's cowboy Caesar.</i>

24:54.920 --> 24:58.557
<i>The only weak link in his
otherwise impregnable armor</i>

24:58.691 --> 25:02.495
<i>is his devotion, his passion,
some would say his obsession</i>

25:02.628 --> 25:04.296
<i>with his beauteous lady wife.</i>

25:04.430 --> 25:06.832
I'm trying to do you
a favor here, Mike,

25:06.966 --> 25:09.301
but every time I do you a favor,
it ends up costing me too.

25:09.435 --> 25:11.770
- <i>Now, come on, Ros...</i>
- Why is Miss Kova still here?

25:11.904 --> 25:14.039
That Range was supposed
to be finished this morning.

25:14.173 --> 25:17.176
- I'm not talking to you, Mike.
- Sorry, boss. Rodge is on the Range.

25:17.309 --> 25:20.045
How many times have I told you?
I don't want Roger up front.

25:20.179 --> 25:22.648
This is a sanctuary
for the ladies. Where is he?

25:22.781 --> 25:24.550
He's up in your office
with your husband.

25:27.786 --> 25:30.389
Misha, darling, I'll have you
out of here in 20 minutes.

25:30.523 --> 25:33.025
Rosalind, I've got a spin
class in half an hour.

25:33.159 --> 25:34.994
Twenty minutes
and no charge.

25:35.127 --> 25:36.829
Lisa, champagne.

25:37.429 --> 25:39.665
- Mike, are you still there?
- <i>Of course I'm still fucking here.</i>

25:39.798 --> 25:42.935
Right, well, if you're still there,
who's ordering the fucking parts?

25:43.235 --> 25:44.436
So what do you think?

25:44.570 --> 25:46.305
Ringing the bell,
but not too loud.

25:47.072 --> 25:48.174
Dipped in honey.

25:49.141 --> 25:50.476
That's on the money.

25:51.277 --> 25:53.712
But you always could make
a good cup of tea, Mickey.

25:53.846 --> 25:55.347
Very nice.

25:56.282 --> 25:57.349
Hello, Ros.

25:58.584 --> 25:59.952
What the fuck
is going on in here?

26:00.452 --> 26:01.854
I should have known
it was you behind this.

26:02.421 --> 26:03.889
Rodge is supposed to be
working down there

26:04.023 --> 26:05.491
and you're up here
blowing his brains out.

26:05.624 --> 26:07.459
- I'm on it, boss.
- You wanna be.

26:07.927 --> 26:09.461
Don't blame the Dodge,
dear.

26:09.595 --> 26:11.130
You know he's got
a special nose

26:11.263 --> 26:13.098
and he's doing
this old dog a favor.

26:13.232 --> 26:14.668
Dodge, get down there
and earn your money.

26:14.800 --> 26:15.834
Gone.

26:18.704 --> 26:20.339
What you doing here anyway?

26:20.472 --> 26:22.676
Thought I'd come by to have
a cup of tea with my wife.

26:23.342 --> 26:25.411
Well, go on, then.
Put the kettle on.

26:27.846 --> 26:29.548
Looks like
the deal's gone through.

26:30.416 --> 26:32.585
- Second thoughts?
- No second thoughts.

26:32.718 --> 26:34.386
I like middle age.

26:34.520 --> 26:37.890
I like gentrification,
private schools, fine wines

26:38.023 --> 26:41.760
and a spoonful of caviar
to help my medicine go down.

26:42.595 --> 26:45.998
But most importantly, I'm looking
forward to spending more time with you.

26:46.131 --> 26:47.199
Course you are.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.602
Look, I don't want you
knocking around here

26:49.735 --> 26:52.037
feeling all unemployed
and lost with yourself.

26:52.538 --> 26:53.939
Well, fuck me.

26:54.708 --> 26:56.242
Most wives would beg
their other halves

26:56.375 --> 26:58.177
to get out
of this game, but not you.

26:58.310 --> 26:59.778
That's because
I know you, darling.

27:00.879 --> 27:04.016
Look, you'll have to
do this elegantly, love.

27:04.684 --> 27:08.120
If word spreads that you're getting
out, that could read as weakness.

27:08.254 --> 27:10.422
And if you smell smoke,
it's 'cause there's a fire,

27:10.556 --> 27:12.726
and that could
get expensive.

27:12.858 --> 27:15.761
So you're gonna have to stamp that
out without any gentrification.

27:16.730 --> 27:17.796
But not you, love.

27:19.633 --> 27:21.333
Don't you do anything messy.

27:22.134 --> 27:24.403
That's why you've
got people, remember?

27:24.536 --> 27:26.572
I fucking love you, babe.

27:26.706 --> 27:28.073
Course you do.

27:29.041 --> 27:30.175
Any chance?

27:31.810 --> 27:33.579
No, you can wait.

27:34.013 --> 27:36.248
I've got a red-hot Russki
with her finger on the trigger.

27:36.382 --> 27:39.018
- Gotta deal with it.
- I don't mind the two of yous.

27:39.151 --> 27:40.853
Go on, fuck off.

27:42.788 --> 27:43.989
Fletcher...

27:45.424 --> 27:47.059
why are you
wasting our time?

27:47.559 --> 27:50.062
I know what happens in my
world and what doesn't.

27:50.195 --> 27:53.299
What I fail to recognize is
why Michael should be motivated

27:53.432 --> 27:55.167
to write you
a check for 20 million.

27:55.301 --> 27:58.971
I find you very impatient, Raymond.
I am a storyteller.

27:59.104 --> 28:01.573
As they say in the film game,
I'm laying pipe.

28:01.940 --> 28:03.777
Well, you'd better put
something through it soon.

28:03.909 --> 28:06.312
So what is that?
Is that a barbecue as well?

28:08.113 --> 28:10.983
- Yes, it is, Fletcher.
- I love a barbie.

28:11.383 --> 28:13.152
That is a useful bit of plant,
then, isn't it?

28:13.285 --> 28:16.055
So that heats up your knees
and cooks at the same time?

28:16.188 --> 28:18.891
You gotta show me
how to get one of them.

28:19.024 --> 28:21.327
Well, you can take it with
you if you fuck off now.

28:22.494 --> 28:23.797
Ray.

28:24.963 --> 28:26.332
Is there any chance
of a steak?

28:32.271 --> 28:36.041
Yeah, all right. Got a bit of
Wagyu in the freezer as it happens.

28:36.175 --> 28:39.646
- I've never had Wagyu.
- Yeah, well, it'll be wasted on you, but it's all I've got.

28:39.779 --> 28:41.715
- I'll get it, mate.
- Oh, no, you're all right.

28:41.847 --> 28:43.750
- Just stay right there.
- Oh.

28:46.218 --> 28:47.386
Ow, fuck me!

28:48.854 --> 28:49.955
It's hot.

28:58.163 --> 29:01.200
He's a sly fox,
that Fletcher.

29:07.807 --> 29:09.341
Night-night, Aslan.

29:10.042 --> 29:11.877
32 LS engines?

29:12.344 --> 29:14.546
You got all these parts
on a 40-foot container?

29:15.514 --> 29:16.515
Yeah.

29:17.349 --> 29:18.550
How'd you get
your hands on that?

29:20.152 --> 29:22.254
Ask no questions,
hear no lies.

29:22.722 --> 29:23.757
Hence the price.

29:24.724 --> 29:26.760
- So how much?
- Oh, no charge.

29:26.892 --> 29:29.194
Okay, so what's the price?

29:29.328 --> 29:30.529
A meeting with your husband.

29:30.663 --> 29:32.297
Oh, fuck off.

29:32.431 --> 29:33.666
That's not gonna happen.

29:34.233 --> 29:35.601
It's in his interest.

29:37.837 --> 29:42.074
Tell you what, keep the parts.
Consider it a gesture of goodwill.

29:44.209 --> 29:45.879
You know
how to get hold of me.

29:47.546 --> 29:49.481
Well, I can't
promise anything.

29:49.615 --> 29:52.050
Dry Eye, he got his little
sit-down with Michael, didn't he?

29:52.918 --> 29:56.088
Bold move, that,
coming in heavy,

29:56.221 --> 29:59.525
sanctioned or unsanctioned...

30:00.526 --> 30:03.562
<i>by the dragon head himself,
Lord George.</i>

30:04.229 --> 30:06.465
<i>Well, he's a naughty boy,
that George.</i>

30:06.866 --> 30:09.636
<i>But Dry Eye,
oh, he's next generation,</i>

30:09.769 --> 30:12.938
<i>and them Chinamen, they upgrade
quicker than i-fucking-Phones.</i>

30:13.071 --> 30:14.373
Is he making moves?

30:16.275 --> 30:18.110
<i>Is he breaking out on his own?</i>

30:18.243 --> 30:20.747
<i>Big man plans
behind Lord George's back?</i>

30:23.716 --> 30:27.519
To be fair, it was very nicely played
with 100 grand's worth of free car parts,

30:27.654 --> 30:32.124
because everyone knows that the way
to a man's heart is through his wife.

30:34.661 --> 30:36.528
You'd make a lovely wife,
Raymond.

30:47.072 --> 30:49.541
Thank you for taking the time
to see me, Michael.

30:50.409 --> 30:51.878
Lord George sends his best.

30:52.311 --> 30:55.047
I only took this meeting
because Ros asked me to.

30:55.180 --> 30:57.082
Make sure to never approach
her like that again.

30:57.717 --> 30:59.351
I meant no disrespect.

31:09.662 --> 31:10.763
How can I help?

31:11.931 --> 31:13.298
I understand
you're getting out.

31:14.466 --> 31:17.269
Getting out.
Getting out of what?

31:17.402 --> 31:19.505
Bed? My head?
The closet?

31:20.005 --> 31:22.140
Don't flirt with me, Dry Eye.
I'm a busy man.

31:22.742 --> 31:24.476
I hear you're
getting out of the game.

31:25.845 --> 31:28.915
And I would like you
to consider an offer.

31:29.047 --> 31:31.049
Look, I'm gonna stop you
right there

31:31.183 --> 31:33.151
so you don't waste any more of
your precious breath, young man.

31:33.285 --> 31:35.487
This is not a discussion
for the two of us.

31:35.621 --> 31:37.657
Unlike the salt and pepper,
it's not on the table.

31:42.160 --> 31:44.596
This is a big number.

32:06.653 --> 32:07.720
Cash.

32:08.287 --> 32:11.758
I am not for sale.

32:13.993 --> 32:16.562
And even if I was,
you're several zeros short.

32:16.696 --> 32:18.898
Now, you may be able to buy
your man's sausage for that,

32:19.032 --> 32:21.366
but to me it just looks
rude at breakfast.

32:24.003 --> 32:25.070
You're out of touch.

32:28.206 --> 32:31.410
You're forgetting the laws of the
jungle, looking down on me.

32:36.582 --> 32:39.585
Now, when the silverback's
got more silver than back...

32:40.687 --> 32:41.955
he best move on...

32:44.122 --> 32:45.591
before he gets moved on.

32:46.759 --> 32:48.293
It's not dignified.

32:49.094 --> 32:52.932
It's beneath you, Michael.
Trying to do you a favor.

32:54.968 --> 32:57.202
This is a big fucking number.

33:03.275 --> 33:04.711
And this?

33:05.544 --> 33:07.279
This is a big fucking gun.

33:15.587 --> 33:17.222
Eyes not so dry now, are they?

33:19.792 --> 33:20.927
Hurts, does it?

33:22.427 --> 33:24.631
You looking for your balls
or a hole in the wall?

33:24.764 --> 33:27.432
- Fuck!
- Where the fuck do you think you're going?

33:27.834 --> 33:31.169
Because you're not going out the way you
came in, you deluded duck-eating cunt.

33:31.303 --> 33:33.973
Talking to me about the laws of the jungle.

33:34.107 --> 33:36.809
What was it? Something
about being beneath me?

33:36.943 --> 33:38.377
Silver on back?

33:39.578 --> 33:42.015
There's only one rule
in this fucking jungle.

33:42.447 --> 33:45.484
When the lion's hungry,
he eats.

33:47.285 --> 33:48.353
<i>You're wrong, Fletcher.</i>

33:48.487 --> 33:50.155
That's not how Michael works.

33:50.288 --> 33:53.325
Yeah, I know. I know. I was
just having a bit of fun.

33:53.693 --> 33:55.560
Every movie needs
a bit of action, doesn't it?

33:55.695 --> 33:57.630
And it's not like Michael
doesn't have a reputation.

33:57.764 --> 33:59.498
Had a reputation.

34:00.133 --> 34:01.834
He's been gentrified.

34:06.839 --> 34:08.675
<i>...big fucking number.</i>

34:09.241 --> 34:13.545
I know how you lot love fables,
so let me share a little fable with you.

34:15.114 --> 34:17.315
There once was
a young and foolish dragon

34:17.449 --> 34:19.686
who came to ask
a wise and cunning lion

34:19.819 --> 34:22.121
about acquiring
his territory.

34:22.254 --> 34:25.190
Now, the lion, he wasn't interested,
so he told the little dragon to fuck off.

34:26.659 --> 34:29.062
But the dragon couldn't
understand what "fuck off" meant,

34:29.194 --> 34:32.031
so he persisted and
continued to ask the lion

34:32.165 --> 34:34.067
about acquiring
his territory.

34:34.199 --> 34:37.003
So the lion took
the little dragon for a walk

34:37.136 --> 34:39.839
and put five bullets
in his little dragon head.

34:41.540 --> 34:43.009
End of story.

34:45.645 --> 34:48.380
Now, allegedly
there's a message in there.

34:48.513 --> 34:51.684
I don't know what it is,
but you're a clever boy, Dry Eye.

34:51.818 --> 34:53.585
Maybe you can
explain it to me.

34:55.587 --> 34:57.389
I think your time's up,
chaps.

34:58.557 --> 35:00.727
Michael, you should recons...

35:03.395 --> 35:04.596
Just marinade on it.

35:06.065 --> 35:07.700
In the meantime, fuck off.

35:12.038 --> 35:15.373
Oh, I bet Mickey was pleased he
took that meeting, wasn't he?

35:15.507 --> 35:17.777
Yes, it went very well.

35:17.910 --> 35:19.946
- Yeah.
- Do you want the top or the bottom?

35:20.412 --> 35:22.048
The bottom, please, darling.

35:22.882 --> 35:25.517
Now, things started to unravel
after that meeting.

35:25.651 --> 35:28.553
Didn't Mickey get a rat
infestation at one of his farms?

35:34.794 --> 35:35.995
Come on.

35:37.395 --> 35:38.463
Stealth, stealth.

35:39.932 --> 35:40.967
Go.

35:43.236 --> 35:44.569
Ballys down.

35:47.539 --> 35:49.474
Let's move. Go, go, go, go.

35:52.277 --> 35:53.278
Shit.

35:54.947 --> 35:57.750
Oh, my days.

35:58.316 --> 35:59.786
Fucking hell.

36:00.418 --> 36:01.754
He said
there'd be a bit of puff.

36:01.888 --> 36:03.355
Yeah, they weren't joking.

36:04.857 --> 36:07.559
Oi, fellas.
It's already packed.

36:07.693 --> 36:08.895
Let's not mess about.

36:09.028 --> 36:10.328
Let's load it up, boys.

36:11.130 --> 36:12.464
Who the fuck are you lot?

36:12.597 --> 36:14.399
Fuck. Cover up.

36:14.967 --> 36:16.334
Do you know
who owns this gaff?

36:16.736 --> 36:18.037
We don't give a fuck.

36:18.537 --> 36:20.072
I think you got off
on the wrong stop.

36:21.073 --> 36:22.407
Oi, Tezza!

36:22.541 --> 36:24.944
- What?
- Fancy a row?

36:27.079 --> 36:28.346
Who are these jokers?

36:28.480 --> 36:29.816
They want our gear.

36:30.482 --> 36:31.583
Marv!

36:32.584 --> 36:33.686
Who's this cunt?

36:34.253 --> 36:35.387
John!

36:36.454 --> 36:38.523
Oh, hello.
It's Dad's Army.

36:38.658 --> 36:39.992
Oi, Frank.

36:41.459 --> 36:43.328
What's this?
Teddy bears' picnic?

36:43.461 --> 36:45.031
Oi, Mo!

36:46.464 --> 36:48.333
Any more rabbits
in that warren?

36:48.466 --> 36:49.635
You lads fancy a warm-up?

36:49.769 --> 36:50.970
Not for you Jelly Babies.

36:51.103 --> 36:52.305
On three, lads.

36:52.939 --> 36:53.873
Three.

36:55.708 --> 36:57.076
Hey!

36:57.210 --> 36:58.978
What? You wanna
call him back, Granddad?

36:59.879 --> 37:01.080
Fuck!

37:01.681 --> 37:02.982
Boss, let me get
two burgers on the stove.

37:03.115 --> 37:04.183
Get that quick, understand?

37:04.317 --> 37:06.118
And I want two chips as well.

37:06.252 --> 37:08.221
What is this smell
of wee in here?

37:10.488 --> 37:12.124
Who the fuck
is this joke, man?

37:12.258 --> 37:13.860
Don't stand near me, son.

37:14.660 --> 37:17.230
You got your mouthwash
muddled up with cat piss.

37:17.697 --> 37:20.532
Take two steps back
and wait your turn.

37:23.135 --> 37:25.403
You better fuck off, old man,
or I'll wet you.

37:25.537 --> 37:27.640
The only thing you can wet's
your underpants, son.

37:27.940 --> 37:29.242
Now, back two steps.

37:29.809 --> 37:32.477
Trigger. That's you. Go on.

37:32.611 --> 37:34.247
- That's you. You're up, bruv.
- Yeah?

37:34.379 --> 37:36.048
Do him. Fucking do him, lad.

37:36.182 --> 37:38.416
Stick it in him, bruv.

37:38.550 --> 37:40.585
Now, if you're gonna stab,
stab, Trigger.

37:40.720 --> 37:43.521
Don't, you know, dance.

37:43.656 --> 37:45.858
What are yous, like a Four
Tops tribute act or something?

37:46.391 --> 37:48.127
The Foreskins. The Redskins.

37:48.261 --> 37:50.029
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Here come the Indians.

37:50.162 --> 37:52.632
Bit of the old Northern Soul,
is it, boys?

37:52.765 --> 37:55.268
Putting the gay
back in Marvin Gaye.

37:55.400 --> 37:57.870
I'm on fire over here, lads. Come on,
I need some back and forth. Come on.

37:58.004 --> 38:00.572
What have you got for me?
Now, make it quick. Make it funny.

38:01.240 --> 38:03.209
Fuck you.

38:03.910 --> 38:06.478
Jeez, that's disappointing.
No, no, not that.

38:07.013 --> 38:08.814
Go again. Go again.

38:08.948 --> 38:11.516
Now, make it sharp.
Cut me with it.

38:11.651 --> 38:13.252
- Fucking do him, laddie.
- Come on.

38:13.386 --> 38:15.054
Yeah. Yeah.

38:15.187 --> 38:16.554
Oh, shit!

38:16.689 --> 38:17.890
Come on then, you dickhead.

38:18.925 --> 38:21.294
My eyes!

38:21.894 --> 38:23.696
Yous are embarrassing
yourself here, lads.

38:24.764 --> 38:27.266
Kids stab, girls shoot,
boys punch.

38:27.400 --> 38:30.369
Grown-ups fight with their heads.
That's where the real battle is.

38:30.502 --> 38:32.104
Up here, in the gray.

38:32.238 --> 38:33.773
He sparked me out, bruv.

38:34.073 --> 38:36.642
Now, wake up, lads.
Life's quick, you're slow.

38:36.776 --> 38:38.476
Life's hard on a bone top.

38:39.412 --> 38:41.847
Come on down the gym.
We'll see what we can do with yous.

38:44.083 --> 38:47.253
Hang on.
Are you the coach?

38:51.924 --> 38:53.426
Coach, it's Ernie.

38:53.993 --> 38:57.296
Shit. It's the fucking coach,
bro. It's the fucking coach.

38:57.430 --> 38:59.031
Ernie, what is it?

38:59.165 --> 39:00.700
<i>Ball's in the back of the net.</i>

39:01.634 --> 39:04.804
We've rung the bell here and we're gonna
include you, because you're our mentor.

39:04.937 --> 39:07.605
I don't know what you're talking about,
but I don't like the sound of it.

39:07.740 --> 39:11.444
- We've landed a load of sticky bush.
- <i>Listen to me, now, Ernie.</i>

39:11.576 --> 39:13.511
Walk away.

39:13.646 --> 39:15.715
It's too late. We're at
the gym now unloading the van.

39:15.848 --> 39:17.083
You took my van?

39:17.750 --> 39:19.819
Wait there.
I'll be back in ten minutes.

39:20.618 --> 39:23.422
I'm sorry to intrude,
but I think you need to see this, boss.

39:26.225 --> 39:29.362
<i>âª Man don't have to Take off the door âª</i>

39:29.494 --> 39:31.529
<i>âª Pull up in a dinger Straight
through The hole in the floor âª</i>

39:31.664 --> 39:33.866
<i>âª We're the Toddlers

39:34.000 --> 39:35.468

39:35.600 --> 39:36.969
<i>âª Plants
Not ten or twenty âª</i>

39:37.103 --> 39:38.938
It's Eggs Benny,
'cause I never get cracked.

39:40.072 --> 39:41.841
<i>âª Man's egg got cracked
And his legs went jelly âª</i>

39:42.607 --> 39:44.810
<i>âª Just know that We're leaving
the room With every last penny âª</i>

39:44.944 --> 39:46.712
They call me Ghost, 'cause
you never see me coming.

39:46.846 --> 39:48.714
<i>âª Just know it's over
When you see ghosts âª</i>

39:48.848 --> 39:50.983
<i>âª Spinning back kick

39:51.117 --> 39:53.419
<i>âª Man don't want that smoke Big
elbow to The top of the dome âª</i>

39:54.120 --> 39:57.156
My name's Ernie. 'Cause the left hand's
fast and the right hand's sturdy.

39:57.289 --> 39:59.658
<i>âª The left hand's fast
And the right hand's sturdy âª</i>

39:59.792 --> 40:01.694
<i>âª You know I've been Bad from early,

40:01.827 --> 40:03.496
- <i>âª I'm fighting dirty âª</i>
- Jim.

40:03.629 --> 40:05.398
<i>âª Jim, Jim
The Iron Chin âª</i>

40:05.530 --> 40:07.233
<i>âª You already know

40:07.366 --> 40:09.268
<i>âª When it comes to
This fighting thing âª</i>

40:09.402 --> 40:10.903
<i>âª Man'll head-butt him
Put in the double-leg takedown âª</i>

40:11.037 --> 40:12.338
Why are we watching
fight porn, Ray?

40:13.172 --> 40:15.540
Because it's fight porn
at one of my farms.

40:15.674 --> 40:18.010
<i>âª We're the Toddlers
Are you dumb? âª</i>

40:18.144 --> 40:20.413
<i>âª Just know that we come from The

40:20.545 --> 40:23.082
<i>âª Means we're coming For the

40:23.215 --> 40:24.549
<i>âª 'Cause we're coming For your funds,
bang, bang You see us in a gang âª</i>

40:28.521 --> 40:30.256
- Coach.
- Jim, put that shit out.

40:30.389 --> 40:32.091
- I've only just...
- Jim, into the office.

40:32.458 --> 40:34.559
Benny, put down that box
of scorpions. Follow Jim.

40:34.693 --> 40:36.195
It weren't my idea, Coach.

40:37.797 --> 40:39.198
Oh, shit.

40:39.331 --> 40:41.233
Mal, what the fuck did
you do to your nose?

40:41.367 --> 40:42.701
You have a fight
in a week, man.

40:42.835 --> 40:44.070
Looks a lot worse
than what it is.

40:44.203 --> 40:45.738
- I'm a hundred percent.
- Yeah?

40:47.773 --> 40:49.308
Two thousand hits!

40:49.442 --> 40:50.709
Oh, my days!

40:51.043 --> 40:53.879
I look mad in this.
The lighting is banging.

40:54.914 --> 40:57.216
<i>âª Put it on the net Do you wanna bet?
It will do a million a set âª</i>

40:57.349 --> 41:00.920
<i>âª That's it Boxes of bush All
buds, no dust âª</i>

41:01.619 --> 41:04.323
<i>âª Boxes and boxes and boxes We're
the Toddlers Are you dumb? âª</i>

41:05.257 --> 41:08.127
<i>âª Boxes of bush
All buds, no dust âª</i>

41:08.694 --> 41:10.930
<i>âª Boxes and boxes and boxes We're
the Toddlers Are you dumb? âª</i>

41:11.063 --> 41:13.566
Make sure you get the upper cut in.
It looks gangsta.

41:13.933 --> 41:15.434
Is that what I think it is?

41:15.568 --> 41:18.204
Yeah,
but the best version of it.

41:18.337 --> 41:20.139
Tell me you didn't put
that fight porn online.

41:20.272 --> 41:22.541
It's white hot, Coach.
The hits.

41:22.675 --> 41:24.043
It's gone
intergalactic.

41:24.176 --> 41:25.544
What was I thinking,

41:25.678 --> 41:27.646
leaving you kids alone
unsupervised?

41:29.248 --> 41:31.383
Take it down. Now!

41:31.517 --> 41:33.786
I've gotta say,
I was impressed.

41:33.919 --> 41:36.889
The way they fought?
They're on point, guvnor.

41:37.356 --> 41:39.558
Whoever trained them
knows what he's doing.

41:39.692 --> 41:40.993
Thank you.
That's enough.

41:41.427 --> 41:43.162
- Well, I'm just saying.
- Well, quit saying.

41:43.295 --> 41:44.763
Okay, thank you.

41:45.564 --> 41:48.501
No sooner do I entertain
Matthew's offer to buy me out

41:48.634 --> 41:50.703
and reject Dry Eye's offer

41:51.403 --> 41:52.538
does one of my farms
get raided.

41:52.671 --> 41:54.140
First time ever.

41:54.440 --> 41:56.108
Doesn't feel like
a coincidence, does it?

41:56.242 --> 41:58.310
It isn't.
There's fuckery afoot.

41:59.245 --> 42:01.547
- How did they find it?
- I don't know.

42:01.680 --> 42:02.948
I'm making inquiries.

42:04.183 --> 42:05.818
What about Matthew?

42:05.951 --> 42:07.286
He's gonna need reassuring

42:07.419 --> 42:09.021
before he parts
with 400 big ones.

42:09.155 --> 42:11.056
So many questions
unanswered, Ray.

42:11.190 --> 42:14.960
I mean, who'd be smart enough
to find one of Mickey's farms?

42:15.094 --> 42:16.162
Apart from me, of course.

42:17.029 --> 42:20.966
<i>And who would be bold enough
to make such a move?</i>

42:21.100 --> 42:24.003
<i>Especially to film it all
and then post it all online?</i>

42:24.136 --> 42:27.706
Because that is really rubbing
your face in it, isn't it?

42:28.507 --> 42:29.675
<i>I'm here to help, Michael.</i>

42:29.808 --> 42:32.278
I'm your friend, your ally,

42:32.411 --> 42:34.346
your Santa Claus
for all seasons,

42:34.480 --> 42:38.284
and I'd like you to know my team
of elves can be very persuasive.

42:38.684 --> 42:42.388
Persuasive? And why
would I need persuasive?

42:42.521 --> 42:45.891
Well, I hear you might have
had a little trouble.

42:46.759 --> 42:48.827
Now, you helped me before
when my source ran dry,

42:48.961 --> 42:51.397
so I'm just returning
the favor and reminding you

42:51.530 --> 42:53.098
I have effectual friends.

42:53.232 --> 42:54.500
Elves?

42:55.067 --> 42:56.335
Elves?

42:56.468 --> 42:59.238
- Yes. You said elves.
- Did I?

42:59.371 --> 43:00.406
Mm.

43:01.173 --> 43:04.678
No trouble over here, Matthew.
No trouble at all.

43:07.413 --> 43:08.814
So we brought you
a token.

43:08.948 --> 43:10.082
You did?

43:11.850 --> 43:15.554
And what might this be?

43:15.689 --> 43:19.091
It's a paperweight to keep down all
the paper I'm about to give you.

43:19.225 --> 43:22.161
- Well, it looks like a gun.
- And it's a paperweight.

43:22.294 --> 43:26.599
Seeing how in this country,
unlike in our homeland, they're illegal.

43:26.732 --> 43:29.335
So is riding your bicycle
at night without lights.

43:29.468 --> 43:31.070
Laws are there
as a guideline.

43:31.203 --> 43:33.839
In France, it's illegal
to call a pig Napoleon,

43:33.973 --> 43:35.341
but just try and stop me.

43:37.309 --> 43:39.511
I quite like it.
You're very kind.

43:39.646 --> 43:42.181
- Thank you.
- Hands across the sea.

43:42.314 --> 43:44.350
<i>Mickey calmed down the Jew</i>

43:44.483 --> 43:46.085
<i>and it seems the deal
is still going ahead.</i>

43:46.552 --> 43:50.122
<i>But bad timing, jeopardizing
deals, shutting down farms.</i>

43:50.256 --> 43:54.293
<i>It could be an expensive disaster if
Mickey doesn't get this cleaned up.</i>

43:54.728 --> 43:56.495
Should I be scared?

43:57.796 --> 44:01.333
I don't think so,
but I like to err on the side of caution.

44:01.467 --> 44:02.968
What does that mean?

44:03.102 --> 44:04.970
It means I'm going to
have to close shop,

44:05.104 --> 44:08.173
shut this farm down
and make it disappear.

44:08.607 --> 44:10.075
You might see
a couple of trucks around here

44:10.209 --> 44:11.944
over the next few days,
but that's it.

44:12.077 --> 44:14.179
Well, I'm not gonna pretend
that missing out

44:14.313 --> 44:17.349
on a million pounds commission a
year isn't going to hurt somewhat.

44:17.483 --> 44:19.084
The pain is being shared.

44:19.218 --> 44:22.621
Stolen product,
loss of earnings meantime,

44:22.756 --> 44:25.824
the cost of shutting down,
the expense of setting up elsewhere.

44:26.558 --> 44:28.427
It's funny, really, but
it couldn't be worse timing.

44:28.762 --> 44:30.062
How so?

44:30.195 --> 44:31.430
I've...

44:32.598 --> 44:34.900
I've just learned we need
a whole new roof apparently.

44:35.034 --> 44:38.337
As I say, I'm as upset
about this as you are.

44:42.941 --> 44:45.010
- Henry.
- Mickey.

44:45.745 --> 44:49.581
<i>The toffs look after Mickey.
Now Mickey looks after the toffs.</i>

44:50.249 --> 44:52.786
<i>But there's a lot of toffs
to look after.</i>

44:53.619 --> 44:55.621
- Henry.
- <i>And when it rains...</i>

44:55.755 --> 44:57.156
Let me take care of the roof.

44:57.289 --> 44:59.525
<i>...it fucking pours.</i>

45:00.025 --> 45:03.062
<i>Now, there's only one thing that
needs more looking after than a toff,</i>

45:03.195 --> 45:05.665
<i>and that is
a toff's offspring.</i>

45:05.799 --> 45:09.068
<i>Which brings me neatly back
to Big Dave's story,</i>

45:09.201 --> 45:11.705
<i>the very reason I'm sitting
here sipping whiskey with you</i>

45:11.837 --> 45:13.572
<i>in the first fucking place.</i>

45:13.707 --> 45:17.242
<i>This is how Big Dave
is gonna bring Mickey down,</i>

45:17.376 --> 45:21.547
<i>by using and abusing Lord
Pressfield's much-beloved child.</i>

45:21.681 --> 45:26.485
Lord Pressfield's daughter, the famous and
talented Laura, all self-hate and harm,

45:26.618 --> 45:29.888
has fallen for this Power
Noel's smacked-out dark charm,

45:30.022 --> 45:31.691
and I want the lot of them,

45:32.257 --> 45:35.060
especially that
slimy little jam rag Pearson,

45:35.194 --> 45:37.731
in bed with a skint,
discredited toff,

45:37.863 --> 45:41.567
and supplying gear to young
and reckless rock-star royals,

45:41.701 --> 45:43.969
royals unbridled
by distracted parents

45:44.103 --> 45:46.171
too busy skiing
on the Swiss Alps to notice

45:46.305 --> 45:48.040
and too fucking stupid
to care.

45:48.173 --> 45:50.876
I like it.
You're good at this, boss.

45:51.009 --> 45:53.011
Yeah, I know what I'm good at,
Hammy. Fuck off.

45:54.012 --> 45:58.584
<i>Aristocratic, junkie, bulimic,
auto-tuned singing daughter</i>

45:58.718 --> 46:01.253
<i>shacked up with some smacked-out,
once-upon-a-time pop star,</i>

46:01.387 --> 46:03.055
<i>and all looked after
by Mickey Pearson.</i>

46:03.188 --> 46:06.191
I like it.
You know, I like it a lot.

46:06.892 --> 46:08.560
We wrapped her
in cotton wool.

46:08.695 --> 46:10.596
But she was
our little Lor-la.

46:12.131 --> 46:15.000
Charlie called her that because
she couldn't say Laura at first.

46:15.702 --> 46:17.403
We miss her terribly, Mickey.

46:18.504 --> 46:20.105
I've failed as a parent.

46:20.239 --> 46:22.307
You mustn't keep
beating yourself up, dear.

46:22.441 --> 46:25.310
Anne's right, Charles.
You mustn't blame yourselves.

46:25.444 --> 46:27.346
It sounds as though Laura
fell in with the wrong crowd

46:27.479 --> 46:29.948
at a time when she was
particularly vulnerable.

46:30.082 --> 46:31.684
What more
could we do?

46:32.918 --> 46:34.620
It's happened
to so many of our friends.

46:34.754 --> 46:36.221
It's a curse.

46:37.556 --> 46:40.092
- Do you mind if I look into it?
- So you'll help us?

46:41.728 --> 46:43.262
Let me see what I can do.

46:47.667 --> 46:49.636
You should get yourself
one of these, boss.

46:49.769 --> 46:51.403
Well, that's the plan.

46:51.537 --> 46:53.038
Everything all right?

46:53.539 --> 46:54.874
You remember
their daughter?

46:55.007 --> 46:56.942
Yeah, Laura.
Nice girl. Good voice.

46:57.075 --> 47:00.612
Teeny sort of spunk-funk fuck pop.
Shame about the habit.

47:00.747 --> 47:04.016
She's gone missing. They've asked
us to find her, bring her home.

47:04.550 --> 47:05.517
Mm-hmm.

47:06.251 --> 47:07.754
Is that a problem?

47:07.887 --> 47:09.488
Well, I had a feeling
you might ask me this, boss,

47:09.621 --> 47:11.190
so I did some due diligence.

47:11.323 --> 47:13.025
I know where she is
and I don't like it.

47:13.158 --> 47:15.461
- I'd rather we didn't get involved.
- Why not?

47:15.961 --> 47:17.963
<i>She's on
a South London council estate.</i>

47:18.096 --> 47:20.365
- <i>So?</i>
- It's out of our jurisdiction.

47:20.767 --> 47:22.802
There's too many moving parts,
parts that we can't control.

47:22.936 --> 47:24.771
What if she doesn't wanna come?
It's gonna get messy.

47:24.904 --> 47:27.606
Well, that may be true,
but you're still doing it.

47:28.641 --> 47:29.975
I accept that.

47:31.143 --> 47:32.511
But can't you
send Frazier instead?

47:32.645 --> 47:34.346
No, I can't
send Frazier instead.

47:34.480 --> 47:35.815
You're my best man.
I want you.

47:42.387 --> 47:43.989
It's just that
I don't like smackies.

47:44.122 --> 47:46.158
It's the filth and the grime
and the grub in the tub.

47:46.291 --> 47:49.194
I'm not asking your OCD to spend
the weekend with them, Ray.

47:50.797 --> 47:52.364
Think of it
as philanthropy.

47:53.833 --> 47:55.200
Come on,
you're driving.

47:56.568 --> 47:58.537
No good deed
goes unpunished.

47:58.671 --> 48:02.742
And this is where you
have your moment, isn't it, Raymondo?

48:02.876 --> 48:04.543
This is where
you step on stage

48:04.677 --> 48:07.012
and set the dominoes flying
every-fucking-where.

48:08.146 --> 48:09.414
Meaning what?

48:09.548 --> 48:13.085
Meaning no good deed
goes unpunished.

48:13.519 --> 48:14.888
Knock, knock-knock,
knock, knock.

48:24.062 --> 48:25.364
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

48:26.198 --> 48:27.266
Wrong door.

48:27.399 --> 48:28.567
Ah, ah, ah.

48:29.736 --> 48:33.138
My name is Raymond Smith.

48:34.139 --> 48:36.174
Can I step inside
for a moment, please?

48:42.614 --> 48:44.149
How can I help you,
Officer?

48:45.217 --> 48:48.420
I'm not the police. No, I just
need a moment of your time.

48:48.554 --> 48:50.556
It's about Laura Pressfield.

48:51.958 --> 48:53.492
I don't know anyone
of that name.

48:54.293 --> 48:56.595
It would be much easier
for all parties concerned

48:56.729 --> 48:58.865
if I could just step inside
for a moment.

48:59.632 --> 49:00.867
No, fuck off.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.835
Jeez.

49:03.402 --> 49:04.871
That's a nice whip, bruv.

49:05.337 --> 49:07.539
Killer motor. It's a shame
about them rims, though.

49:07.674 --> 49:08.975
Yeah, lend us the keys.

49:09.107 --> 49:10.944
Put some chrome twenty-twos
on that.

49:11.076 --> 49:13.445
Hey, my man's got the Dessies
and the bootcuts, you know.

49:13.579 --> 49:15.280
Deffo linking a jessie.

49:30.063 --> 49:31.396
What the fuck?

49:36.903 --> 49:39.438
- What are you doing here?
- Now, now, now.

49:40.172 --> 49:42.742
- Get the fuck out.
- Now, now, now.

49:48.180 --> 49:50.248
As you was, boys and girls.

50:01.360 --> 50:02.629
Sit down.

50:07.599 --> 50:08.801
Thank you.

50:13.505 --> 50:15.607
Shall we have
a little bit of fresh air?

50:20.813 --> 50:22.949
Who the fuck
are your mates, Brown?

50:23.082 --> 50:26.786
No need to get excited, young man.
We will be gone in a few moments.

50:26.919 --> 50:29.488
No, no, no, you'll be gone before then.
Get the fuck out now.

50:32.659 --> 50:34.861
I can be dangerous if I want to be.
Get the fuck out now.

50:34.994 --> 50:38.765
Sit down, Power,
before you get yourself into more trouble.

50:38.898 --> 50:41.299
How d'you know my name? How
the fuck does he know my name?

50:41.433 --> 50:43.036
I know all your names.

50:43.736 --> 50:46.973
Apart from
that little anomaly.

50:47.840 --> 50:49.809
I know where
you went to school.

50:50.810 --> 50:52.779
I know who your parents are.

50:52.912 --> 50:57.449
And I know you'll suck a
cock for a five-pound bag.

51:01.520 --> 51:02.955
Now sit.

51:11.864 --> 51:14.867
Just so we're clear,
I work for a man,

51:15.534 --> 51:17.170
a powerful man.

51:17.536 --> 51:18.503
Michael Pearson.

51:18.638 --> 51:20.205
Ten points to you, Laura.

51:20.338 --> 51:21.674
Who's Michael Pearson?

51:22.041 --> 51:25.210
Friend of her father's.
Runs London's puff game.

51:25.343 --> 51:26.679
A big dick swinger.

51:27.146 --> 51:28.513
What is your name,
young man?

51:29.481 --> 51:31.718
- Aslan.
- And where are you from, Aslan?

51:31.851 --> 51:33.786
You don't sound like
one of the natives.

51:34.386 --> 51:35.587
Disneyland.

51:35.722 --> 51:37.289
Sounds about right.

51:37.824 --> 51:39.558
Well, you are correct.
He is a big dick swinger.

51:39.692 --> 51:42.028
But I wouldn't want him
to hear you say that.

51:42.161 --> 51:45.898
It's best you forget what he apparently
does for a living after we depart.

51:46.733 --> 51:50.103
Now, Laura, your father's
asked us to bring you home.

51:50.235 --> 51:51.536
She's not going anywhere.

52:00.913 --> 52:02.181
Do you mind if I sit?

52:02.314 --> 52:03.548
Yes.

52:13.525 --> 52:18.765
I don't build a joint like
the Americans and the new school...

52:19.464 --> 52:23.236
back-strapping, jockstrapping,
coke-wrapping, and all that bollocks.

52:23.770 --> 52:26.739
I like a good old-fashioned
50-50 mix, me.

52:27.206 --> 52:28.674
That's how we used to play.

52:29.274 --> 52:31.077
If there's one thing
I will never understand,

52:31.210 --> 52:33.311
it's why you lot
get addicted to heroin.

52:33.913 --> 52:37.750
If there's one drug you should not
chase, it is the dirty dragon.

52:38.651 --> 52:40.186
Did you ever
give it a spin, Bunny?

52:40.318 --> 52:43.156
No, not me, Ray.
I don't even puff anymore.

52:43.288 --> 52:47.325
Of course not. Bunny likes the gym.
You can probably see that.

52:48.227 --> 52:51.164
- What are you benching these days?
- Three wheels a side.

52:52.064 --> 52:53.266
What about you, Brown?

52:53.699 --> 52:56.903
- What about me?
- What could I lift?

52:57.569 --> 53:00.273
You couldn't lift
a wheel of cheese, you cunt.

53:03.743 --> 53:04.977
Now...

53:06.879 --> 53:08.781
if you wanna be naughty,

53:08.915 --> 53:11.951
what happened to a little smoke
and a poke and a glass of wine,

53:12.084 --> 53:14.319
some Barry White,
candles around the bath

53:14.452 --> 53:15.988
and put your finger
in the missus?

53:16.789 --> 53:18.224
Who's Barry White?

53:18.858 --> 53:20.293
Big black geezer.

53:20.425 --> 53:21.694
Sexy voice.

53:21.828 --> 53:23.629
I'm... I'm lost.

53:23.763 --> 53:27.465
Am I in the bath with Barry
White's finger in my missus?

53:27.867 --> 53:31.971
Be quiet, Brown. You were lost
long before Barry White walked in.

53:43.883 --> 53:45.818
If you lot are unhappy,

53:45.952 --> 53:48.486
you should share your thoughts
with your friends.

53:49.121 --> 53:52.357
Nice friends. Talk it out,
find a positive solution.

53:52.959 --> 53:57.029
But, no,
all you lot choose squalor.

53:57.997 --> 54:00.532
Drowning in
your liberal white guilt.

54:01.600 --> 54:03.302
Sorry,
what am I guilty of?

54:03.435 --> 54:05.503
Being a cunt, Brown.

54:06.839 --> 54:08.373
Being a cunt.

54:09.842 --> 54:11.844
Anyway, I'm not your shrink.

54:11.978 --> 54:14.180
I'm just trying to radiate
some positive vibes man to man.

54:14.313 --> 54:16.849
I mean, that's what this puff
game used to be all about.

54:20.319 --> 54:21.687
Anyway...

54:23.856 --> 54:25.091
back to you, Laura,

54:25.224 --> 54:28.393
queen in this here
kingdom of shit.

54:28.995 --> 54:32.865
A single rose
in a cauldron of thorns.

54:34.599 --> 54:36.235
Are you ready
to turn the corner?

54:37.236 --> 54:39.404
Open the curtains
and let the light in?

54:39.872 --> 54:42.775
Do your mum and dad a favor
and try the impossible,

54:43.376 --> 54:45.211
make yourself happy.

54:51.516 --> 54:52.550
All right.

54:53.252 --> 54:55.453
Fucking hell.
That was easy.

54:56.588 --> 54:58.190
All right, fantastic.

54:58.324 --> 54:59.926
Well, in that case, Bunny,

55:00.059 --> 55:02.194
will you help Laura
with her things, please?

55:02.328 --> 55:04.063
Incoming.

55:04.196 --> 55:06.098
It's all right, Bunny.
I don't really have anything.

55:12.570 --> 55:14.273
It's a shithole anyway.

55:17.643 --> 55:18.978
Don't go. Please, wait!

55:21.881 --> 55:23.115
Sit down!

55:25.084 --> 55:28.154
Touch me again,
I'll cut your fucking arm off.

55:31.390 --> 55:33.426
It's all right, Bunny.
Keep going.

55:34.727 --> 55:38.097
I just will not be
manhandled by a junkie cunt.

55:42.401 --> 55:46.973
Dave, keep the kids in
school for one minute.

55:51.377 --> 55:53.245
My man
probably wants to buy weed.

55:53.379 --> 55:56.349
- What, da Loud Pack, boss?
- Or the Purple Haze then.

55:56.481 --> 55:58.483
My man just pulled out
a donkey choker, bruv.

55:58.616 --> 56:00.152
Keep your puff.

56:00.820 --> 56:04.589
Buy yourself a sticky book
and a packet of sweets.

56:04.724 --> 56:05.825
All-in!

56:07.126 --> 56:08.361
Now, now, now.

56:10.562 --> 56:12.098
You cunt.

56:12.732 --> 56:14.300
Fuck you!

56:14.433 --> 56:17.136
Hey, that is
a naughty kettle, bruv.

56:17.269 --> 56:18.536
Hey, what's the time,
Mr. Wolf?

56:18.671 --> 56:22.641
It's time for you
to fuck off, lads.

56:22.775 --> 56:25.311
Fucking hit him, Brown!

56:28.613 --> 56:31.117
Ah. He's bought you a gun.

56:31.250 --> 56:33.252
That's a nice little gift.

56:33.386 --> 56:35.654
Five years in prison
all in one little box.

56:35.788 --> 56:38.657
Oh, but that's not a gun,
dear. That's a paperweight.

56:38.791 --> 56:42.928
Course it is, along with a
family of six baby bullets.

56:44.130 --> 56:45.664
Guess we'll have to
get rid of that.

56:46.665 --> 56:48.701
- Hello, Ray.
- Rosalind.

56:49.068 --> 56:50.369
Sorry for the interruption.

56:50.503 --> 56:52.004
What do you need, Ray?

56:52.138 --> 56:54.640
Laura Pressfield
has been returned home safely.

57:01.380 --> 57:02.515
Good.

57:05.051 --> 57:06.185
What else?

57:07.219 --> 57:09.255
One of her associates
had an accident.

57:10.622 --> 57:13.092
- Shit.
- He fell out of a window, boss.

57:13.225 --> 57:14.559
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

57:14.693 --> 57:18.197
It's time for you
to fuck off, lads.

57:20.332 --> 57:21.566
Oh, shit.

57:21.700 --> 57:23.302
Sounds like
quite an extreme accident.

57:23.436 --> 57:25.638
Yeah, it was more like
a death, really.

57:27.273 --> 57:29.308
- Oh, shit.
- Selfie, bruv!

57:29.442 --> 57:30.575
So you killed someone?

57:31.177 --> 57:33.245
No. It was the gravity
that killed him.

57:34.280 --> 57:35.815
- Who was he?
- Aslan.

57:35.948 --> 57:38.250
Some Russian kid
with tracks on his arms.

57:38.384 --> 57:40.152
Russian kid?
That doesn't sound good.

57:40.286 --> 57:41.320
Anyone see you?

57:41.454 --> 57:43.122
Little selfie? Selfie, bruv?

57:43.255 --> 57:44.423
Shit.

57:44.790 --> 57:46.826
Nothing was recorded.
We left it clean.

57:47.093 --> 57:49.462
- The body?
- I've dealt with that.

57:51.197 --> 57:53.732
- This is not ideal.
- It is not.

57:54.400 --> 57:56.936
<i>You can't be fooled
by how those junkies dress.</i>

57:57.570 --> 58:00.706
- <i>They went to schools, expensive schools.</i>
- Aslan.

58:00.840 --> 58:03.275
<i>Their parents
have money, lots of money.</i>

58:04.443 --> 58:06.445
And money can be a problem.

58:07.947 --> 58:09.448
Shit.

58:09.582 --> 58:12.318
I bet you told Mickey nothing
about what happened.

58:12.852 --> 58:16.055
You're fishing, Fletcher,
because you've got no idea.

58:16.188 --> 58:19.058
You're right, I am fishing.

58:19.191 --> 58:23.262
Look at this. I'm fishing
in my little baggie.

58:24.296 --> 58:25.764
And what have I found?

58:27.399 --> 58:28.467
Oh.

58:28.601 --> 58:30.870
Thank you.
Or should I say...

58:31.770 --> 58:32.805
<i>spasibo?</i>

58:33.172 --> 58:34.607
What's that young man
doing?

58:34.740 --> 58:36.575
Is he looking for
something on the floor?

58:37.076 --> 58:38.477
Frazier.

58:39.111 --> 58:41.614
Lads, we're gonna
need those phones.

58:42.281 --> 58:44.049
Hey, run. Move, bruv. Move.

58:44.183 --> 58:46.452
Bunny, get him.
Fucking clean that up.

58:46.952 --> 58:49.488
- Come on then, catch me, dickhead.
- Little cunt.

59:13.913 --> 59:15.214
Wanker!

59:20.452 --> 59:23.222
What you saying now, fam? Huh?
Now I've got backup.

59:24.924 --> 59:27.026
You couldn't back up
a phone, you cunt.

59:27.393 --> 59:29.328
Bruv, this guy's trying
to take my phone.

59:29.461 --> 59:31.897
- Fucking do him.
- Back the fuck up!

59:32.031 --> 59:33.232
How you gonna talk your way
out of this one, mate?

59:33.365 --> 59:34.833
Easy, lads.

59:36.168 --> 59:39.772
I'm sure you're all
roadmen, gangsters,

59:39.905 --> 59:43.175
proper naughty boys
and all that bollocks.

59:44.410 --> 59:46.612
But I come in peace.

59:48.380 --> 59:51.417
I'm not trying to steal it.
I'm trying to buy it.

59:52.751 --> 59:55.588
For good money.
Honest money.

59:56.755 --> 59:58.490
Yeah? What, this phone?

01:00:01.026 --> 01:00:03.762
- How much?
- A full bag.

01:00:04.664 --> 01:00:08.400
Then I'll be gone,
like the darkness at dawn.

01:00:09.235 --> 01:00:12.204
How about you give us that bag
and be gone anyway?

01:00:19.211 --> 01:00:21.080
Stop fucking around, cunt.

01:00:23.515 --> 01:00:27.419
Give me the phone
and take the money.

01:00:28.053 --> 01:00:30.222
Drop the fucking money
and run, boy.

01:00:37.763 --> 01:00:38.797
Right.

01:00:40.734 --> 01:00:43.637
- Fuck!
- Move, move, move!

01:00:45.371 --> 01:00:46.472
Now...

01:00:47.906 --> 01:00:52.444
put the phone on the ground.

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:03.956
Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta.

01:01:14.266 --> 01:01:16.902
- Fucking prick.
- What are you doing, Dave?

01:01:17.269 --> 01:01:20.439
- It's on him somewhere.
- I'm trying. Just give me a second. Fuck.

01:01:21.741 --> 01:01:22.908
<i>Ray?</i>

01:01:23.275 --> 01:01:25.477
Can I use your toilet?
Just a pee-pee?

01:01:29.214 --> 01:01:31.517
Fletcher, shoes off inside.

01:01:31.651 --> 01:01:33.552
Leave them by the door.

01:01:33.687 --> 01:01:35.187
Yes, Mommy.

01:01:37.156 --> 01:01:39.191
Come on, bruv.
Where's your pace, brother?

01:01:39.626 --> 01:01:41.193
You can do better than that.

01:01:41.327 --> 01:01:42.528
Wanker.

01:01:43.195 --> 01:01:45.331
Come on, Bunny,
stop fucking about.

01:01:45.998 --> 01:01:48.500
Look at you sweat, bruv.

01:01:48.635 --> 01:01:50.804
Nearly there.
Nearly there. Nearly there.

01:01:50.936 --> 01:01:53.539
Lift those legs up.
Come on, bro.

01:01:53.673 --> 01:01:55.474
You should have brought
your running shoes today, bro.

01:01:55.607 --> 01:01:56.842
Trying out for the Olympics,
are we?

01:01:57.176 --> 01:01:59.578
It's fucking Usain Bolt.
Come on, Usain.

01:02:12.424 --> 01:02:13.459
Phone.

01:02:22.702 --> 01:02:24.036
Sorry about that.

01:02:26.605 --> 01:02:28.006
Can I go home now?

01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:30.943
Course you can, darling.
Course you can.

01:02:51.865 --> 01:02:53.031
Is there a problem here, Ray?

01:02:53.165 --> 01:02:54.466
I don't know.

01:02:55.601 --> 01:02:57.202
Is there a problem here,
Fletcher?

01:02:58.103 --> 01:02:59.905
I see no problem at all.

01:03:01.775 --> 01:03:03.542
I forgot to wash my hands.

01:03:05.244 --> 01:03:06.713
Next time call first.

01:03:06.846 --> 01:03:08.247
Sorry, guv.

01:03:09.749 --> 01:03:11.583
And you haven't
heard a whisper?

01:03:11.718 --> 01:03:13.585
How can so much bush go missing
and nobody know nothing?

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:16.088
<i>Ah,
I've heard nothing, Coach, honestly.</i>

01:03:16.221 --> 01:03:18.056
<i>Nothing on the street.
But you know what?</i>

01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:20.058
<i>There is this geezer
called Mickey Pearson.</i>

01:03:20.192 --> 01:03:22.261
- Who the fuck is Mickey Pearson?
- <i>Ah, you know him.</i>

01:03:22.394 --> 01:03:24.296
<i>He runs the bush game.
He's a horrible cunt.</i>

01:03:24.430 --> 01:03:26.465
<i>You don't wanna
step on his toes.</i>

01:03:26.598 --> 01:03:28.701
<i>But there's no way your lads
jimmied their way into his car,</i>

01:03:28.835 --> 01:03:30.469
<i>so I wouldn't concern yourself
with that.</i>

01:03:30.602 --> 01:03:32.271
All right, you know
where to find me, Chasa.

01:03:32.404 --> 01:03:33.640
Keep your ear to the ground.

01:03:33.773 --> 01:03:35.374
Primetime, in you get.

01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:38.310
Ernie.

01:03:39.478 --> 01:03:40.946
Did you get
that Chinese fella's name?

01:03:41.079 --> 01:03:42.181
- Phuc.
- What?

01:03:42.314 --> 01:03:43.949
Phuc, like "fuck" with a "Ph."

01:03:44.082 --> 01:03:46.418
Don't get street with me, Ernie.
Where does he live?

01:03:46.552 --> 01:03:48.688
- Posh part of Croydon.
- Drop the rope.

01:03:48.822 --> 01:03:50.456
There is no posh part
of Croydon.

01:03:50.890 --> 01:03:54.661
- It's comparative, innit?
- Oi, Ernie, what are you doing?

01:03:54.794 --> 01:03:56.295
Why aren't you training,
you black cunt?

01:03:56.830 --> 01:03:58.096
I'm on my own here.

01:04:00.265 --> 01:04:01.701
Did he just call me
a black cunt?

01:04:02.134 --> 01:04:04.637
- Yes, he did.
- He can't do that. That's racist.

01:04:04.771 --> 01:04:07.573
But, you are black and you are a
cunt, Ernie. Those are the facts.

01:04:07.707 --> 01:04:09.575
I don't think Primetime cares
what race you run in.

01:04:10.209 --> 01:04:12.679
The fact that I'm black has nothing
to do with the fact I'm a cunt.

01:04:12.812 --> 01:04:15.013
He didn't say black people
were cunts, Ernie.

01:04:15.147 --> 01:04:17.149
He was being specific to you.
One has nothing to do with the other.

01:04:17.282 --> 01:04:18.852
And I'd go a step further,
if I'm not mistaken,

01:04:18.984 --> 01:04:20.986
and say it was a term
of familiar affection.

01:04:21.119 --> 01:04:23.790
Primetime's a Gypsy.
I wouldn't call him a pikey cunt.

01:04:23.923 --> 01:04:25.925
Why not? He might be
very understanding.

01:04:26.058 --> 01:04:27.493
Only if it comes from
a place of love, of course.

01:04:27.627 --> 01:04:29.261
Now, back to
the issue at hand.

01:04:29.394 --> 01:04:31.497
I need that Chinese
geezer's address, okay?

01:04:31.631 --> 01:04:33.198
You'll have it
by the morning, Coach.

01:04:33.332 --> 01:04:35.167
- Good lad.
- And, Coach...

01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:36.870
- What?
- I've got some good news.

01:04:37.002 --> 01:04:39.338
- What?
- I found out whose weed we took.

01:04:41.206 --> 01:04:43.175
And now
you fucking tell me!

01:04:44.109 --> 01:04:45.511
Did I say stop?

01:04:47.012 --> 01:04:49.682
Ernie, this is not
the fucking time

01:04:49.816 --> 01:04:51.918
to keep your cards
close to your chest.

01:04:53.018 --> 01:04:55.087
Just tell me his name
isn't Mickey Pearson.

01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:57.322
Blimey, Coach,
are you a Gypsy too?

01:04:57.456 --> 01:04:59.091
You been reading tea leaves,
got a crystal ball?

01:04:59.224 --> 01:05:01.360
That is not good news,
Ernie.

01:05:01.493 --> 01:05:05.063
Mickey Pearson is terrible news in the
face of a violent and expensive debt.

01:05:14.106 --> 01:05:15.541
I'm here
to see your boss.

01:05:22.649 --> 01:05:24.082
Feel free to talk.

01:05:24.717 --> 01:05:26.686
I gather you're the
consigliere of the outfit

01:05:26.819 --> 01:05:29.488
that my boys were stupid
enough to fuck around with.

01:05:30.723 --> 01:05:34.359
On that note, I'd like to extend
my apologies on their behalf.

01:05:35.127 --> 01:05:36.729
My boys, they're naive,

01:05:37.296 --> 01:05:39.331
they've had hard lives and they're
just starting to come good,

01:05:39.464 --> 01:05:42.367
but they're my lads,
my responsibility,

01:05:42.735 --> 01:05:44.904
so it's me that should be
accountable for their actions.

01:05:45.437 --> 01:05:49.107
Now, I can return your goods,
but I can't return the inconvenience,

01:05:49.241 --> 01:05:51.310
the time,
the fucking headache.

01:05:52.210 --> 01:05:57.316
And so I offer you my loyalty,
my word, my time,

01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:59.618
until that debt is settled.

01:06:02.187 --> 01:06:06.291
I'll make amends,
but just leave me lads alone.

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:11.698
First of all, I'm gonna need to know
how your lads got the information

01:06:11.831 --> 01:06:13.800
about where our farm
was sited,

01:06:14.199 --> 01:06:15.969
'cause that's not
common knowledge.

01:06:17.169 --> 01:06:21.373
Once we've overcome that little
challenge, then we can talk.

01:06:23.508 --> 01:06:25.645
Well, I can do
better than that.

01:06:33.151 --> 01:06:36.588
His name is Phuc, but it's spelled with
a "Ph," so it sounds like "fu-uck."

01:06:38.691 --> 01:06:40.258
So it's Phu-uc?

01:06:40.392 --> 01:06:42.461
What?
Yeah, something like that.

01:06:42.594 --> 01:06:46.431
Anyway, he's the kid that gave us
the skunk farm job. Do you know him?

01:06:46.565 --> 01:06:49.468
Yeah, we've met before,
haven't we, Phu-uc... Phuc?

01:06:49.601 --> 01:06:50.670
That's the one.
Phu-uc?

01:06:50.803 --> 01:06:52.805
- Phuc.
- Phuc.

01:06:54.306 --> 01:06:55.440
All right.

01:06:55.942 --> 01:06:57.644
Don't do anything stupid, now,
son, right?

01:07:00.612 --> 01:07:02.214
How did you know
the location?

01:07:02.347 --> 01:07:03.850
I need my inhaler.

01:07:03.983 --> 01:07:05.384
Yeah, in a minute.

01:07:06.019 --> 01:07:09.154
I need you to tell me how you
knew the location of our farm.

01:07:10.355 --> 01:07:13.826
I've been trailing you for months.
Dry Eye was given the address.

01:07:14.794 --> 01:07:17.262
I can't breathe!
I need it, please.

01:07:17.396 --> 01:07:20.298
All right, Phuc.
Calm the fu-uck down.

01:07:22.835 --> 01:07:25.437
Right, here, steady yourself.
For fuck's sake.

01:07:27.406 --> 01:07:28.808
Sort him out.

01:07:29.441 --> 01:07:31.144
All right.

01:07:32.611 --> 01:07:33.846
Here, here, look at me.

01:07:34.513 --> 01:07:35.782
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:07:35.915 --> 01:07:37.549
- Where's your inhaler?
- There.

01:07:39.118 --> 01:07:41.319
Right, here, take a blim.

01:07:41.453 --> 01:07:45.091
Now, good boy. There you go, son.
You all right?

01:07:48.027 --> 01:07:49.062
Fuck!

01:07:50.163 --> 01:07:51.229
No, stop, don't!

01:07:59.038 --> 01:08:02.041
Fuck's sake, Ray. You need
to invest in some parachutes.

01:08:02.474 --> 01:08:04.177
There's a pattern
emerging here.

01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:05.678
I'm sorry, boss.

01:08:05.812 --> 01:08:07.914
And who's this
jumping Phuc boy, anyway?

01:08:08.047 --> 01:08:10.549
- It's Dry Eye's man.
- You mean Lord George's man.

01:08:11.084 --> 01:08:14.619
It could just be Dry Eye's doing.
He's been getting bold lately.

01:08:14.754 --> 01:08:18.091
Yeah. Well,
they still all work for Lord George.

01:08:19.291 --> 01:08:20.993
I'm gonna take care
of this one myself.

01:08:49.055 --> 01:08:50.156
Lord George.

01:08:50.756 --> 01:08:52.125
Mr. Pearson.

01:08:53.591 --> 01:08:55.094
And to what do I owe?

01:09:06.939 --> 01:09:08.006
What you watching?

01:09:09.307 --> 01:09:10.810
I'm watching the telly.

01:09:11.376 --> 01:09:13.112
What you watching
on the telly?

01:09:13.246 --> 01:09:15.747
I'm watching
the horse racing.

01:09:16.215 --> 01:09:19.652
Live satellite
from Hong Kong.

01:09:20.618 --> 01:09:22.220
My only vice.

01:09:22.354 --> 01:09:24.724
Well, that's not
strictly true, is it?

01:09:25.224 --> 01:09:26.893
Meaning?

01:09:27.026 --> 01:09:30.495
Meaning I've always taken vice
to be the definition

01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:33.598
of any criminal activity
or wicked behavior

01:09:33.733 --> 01:09:36.501
involving prostitution,
pornography or drugs,

01:09:36.636 --> 01:09:38.904
so, no...

01:09:39.971 --> 01:09:43.276
racing is definitely not
your only vice, your lordship.

01:09:43.408 --> 01:09:46.344
I'd say you're eyebrows deep
in every vice known to man.

01:09:46.478 --> 01:09:48.580
- There is a difference.
- Being?

01:09:49.215 --> 01:09:55.554
I facilitate. I don't participate
in any of the aforementioned vices.

01:09:58.124 --> 01:09:59.225
What about tea?

01:10:10.002 --> 01:10:11.369
What about tea?

01:10:11.503 --> 01:10:14.640
Well, that too is a vice.

01:10:15.641 --> 01:10:17.509
Caffeine is a drug,
don't you know?

01:10:17.643 --> 01:10:21.479
So is that what you're here
to talk to me about? Tea?

01:10:21.613 --> 01:10:25.417
Sweet Mary Jane is my vice
of choice, as you well know.

01:10:25.852 --> 01:10:29.121
Of course, I'm addicted to
selling it, not consuming it.

01:10:29.487 --> 01:10:32.725
I specifically chose
to deal in marijuana.

01:10:33.159 --> 01:10:35.061
Sure, I could see
there was more to be made

01:10:35.194 --> 01:10:38.798
in shifting the white or the brown
powder, as you so chose,

01:10:38.931 --> 01:10:43.468
but, you see, my jam,
it doesn't kill anyone,

01:10:43.870 --> 01:10:45.570
and I like that.

01:10:47.974 --> 01:10:49.642
<i>While your poison...</i>

01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:55.447
is and always has been
a destroyer of worlds.

01:11:03.656 --> 01:11:08.728
So, yes, your facilitation is
most definitely participation.

01:11:18.905 --> 01:11:21.941
But I'm not here to give you a
sermon on situational ethics.

01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:25.344
So why the fuck
are you here?

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:44.596
You're starting a war
with me, George,

01:11:44.730 --> 01:11:46.431
and I'm trying to moonwalk
with elegance here,

01:11:46.564 --> 01:11:48.466
but I'm finding it
very fucking difficult.

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:50.136
Laura!

01:11:50.269 --> 01:11:51.938
<i>I don't fuck around with puff.</i>

01:11:52.071 --> 01:11:54.106
You send your man Dry Eye
around my place

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:56.075
to see if he can buy
my business for a few beans.

01:11:56.208 --> 01:11:57.276
Laura!

01:11:59.477 --> 01:12:01.347
<i>You didn't
think I'd find out?</i>

01:12:01.479 --> 01:12:03.349
Having me followed
for months?

01:12:04.616 --> 01:12:06.919
Yeah. You crossed the line,

01:12:07.053 --> 01:12:08.620
<i>and that comes
with a price.</i>

01:12:09.221 --> 01:12:11.157
You raided
one of my locations.

01:12:11.891 --> 01:12:13.659
You know the rules,
George.

01:12:14.459 --> 01:12:15.962
What the fuck
were you thinking?

01:12:16.095 --> 01:12:17.930
You raided one of
my locations.

01:12:18.064 --> 01:12:19.932
<i>What the fuck
were you thinking?</i>

01:12:20.299 --> 01:12:22.335
What the fuck
were you thinking, George?

01:12:58.603 --> 01:13:01.707
Should you
try and undermine me,

01:13:02.441 --> 01:13:05.177
or should you attempt
to threaten my position again,

01:13:05.311 --> 01:13:07.913
I will be forced to accept
your call to arms.

01:13:08.047 --> 01:13:09.248
Do you understand?

01:13:11.717 --> 01:13:12.818
Good.

01:13:14.186 --> 01:13:17.857
Now, I can see you're feeling
somewhat under the weather.

01:13:18.357 --> 01:13:20.059
<i>That's because
I spiked your tea</i>

01:13:20.192 --> 01:13:22.995
<i>with a nasty little parasitic
genus called shigella.</i>

01:13:23.829 --> 01:13:27.333
Left unattended, you will shit yourself
to death before the sun doth set.

01:13:29.101 --> 01:13:31.070
I suggest taking
two of these fizzy biscuits.

01:13:33.538 --> 01:13:35.241
You'll be fine
in an hour or two,

01:13:35.841 --> 01:13:38.144
long enough to consider
your past indiscretions.

01:13:44.050 --> 01:13:47.753
And, George, if I can get to
you in your own kitchen...

01:13:49.388 --> 01:13:50.489
I can get to you anywhere.

01:13:58.697 --> 01:14:01.367
- Did you do it?
- Do what?

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:03.969
Did you raid
Mickey Pearson's farm?

01:14:04.103 --> 01:14:08.207
- No.
- So you're telling me that Phuc did this behind your back.

01:14:09.075 --> 01:14:11.844
Well, let's just say this.
He didn't do it in front of it.

01:14:12.610 --> 01:14:13.712
He did it
without my blessing.

01:14:13.846 --> 01:14:15.414
But you did go behind my back

01:14:15.548 --> 01:14:17.316
and offer to buy his business.

01:14:19.351 --> 01:14:21.987
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

01:14:24.423 --> 01:14:26.659
Now, let me warn you
the way you warn me.

01:14:27.592 --> 01:14:31.464
There comes a point where
the young succeed the old.

01:14:32.565 --> 01:14:33.732
Don't push me.

01:14:38.237 --> 01:14:39.872
There are some things
I don't know about.

01:14:40.005 --> 01:14:43.109
Something between Dry Eye
and Lord George.

01:14:43.242 --> 01:14:48.547
Now, whatever it was,
someone killed Lord George.

01:14:49.014 --> 01:14:53.452
Anyone else might think
that was you or Mickey.

01:14:55.921 --> 01:14:58.057
Shall we continue
with our little story?

01:14:59.725 --> 01:15:01.794
Does that arouse
your interest, Raymond?

01:15:02.428 --> 01:15:03.929
So Matthew knows Dry Eye.

01:15:05.264 --> 01:15:07.299
- So what?
- Well, yes, I agree.

01:15:07.433 --> 01:15:08.801
Perhaps they were
just meeting up

01:15:08.934 --> 01:15:10.536
to talk about holidaying
in the Maldives

01:15:10.669 --> 01:15:14.507
or the long-term implications
of leaving the EU.

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:19.512
But I filmed it, had it lip-read,
translated and transcribed.

01:15:19.645 --> 01:15:22.615
Rather like the classic
1974 film <i>The Conversation,</i>

01:15:22.748 --> 01:15:25.117
starring Gene Hackman
and John Cazale.

01:15:25.251 --> 01:15:28.554
You know, Coppola slipped that
one out between the <i>Godfathers.</i>

01:15:29.121 --> 01:15:31.457
It wasn't really for me.
It's a bit boring, to be honest.

01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:36.595
Now, can I just say, that Matthew,
he's quite something, isn't he?

01:15:36.729 --> 01:15:38.697
He's not
your average American.

01:15:38.831 --> 01:15:42.134
He's a Mr. International.
Even speaks a bit of Cantonese.

01:15:42.268 --> 01:15:47.641
Come here. You play Dry Eye
and I shall be Matthew.

01:15:49.241 --> 01:15:50.442
Come on.

01:15:55.114 --> 01:15:57.883
All right.

01:15:59.118 --> 01:16:00.786
Try and get it in time
with his lips, all right?

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:02.521
- Yeah, yeah.
- Ready?

01:16:03.622 --> 01:16:04.823
Roll camera. Action.

01:16:18.170 --> 01:16:20.539
<i>There was an incident.
Lord George...</i>

01:16:20.674 --> 01:16:21.774
<i>Fuck's sake, Raymond.</i>

01:16:21.907 --> 01:16:23.442
It's a bit fucking wooden.

01:16:23.576 --> 01:16:25.444
Put something into it,
you know, a bit of welly.

01:16:25.978 --> 01:16:27.413
And action.

01:16:27.546 --> 01:16:28.914
There was an incident.

01:16:29.048 --> 01:16:30.716
Lord George
didn't come through it.

01:16:30.849 --> 01:16:32.418
Didn't come through it?

01:16:32.551 --> 01:16:34.920
The last thing you need to do
is attract any octopus.

01:16:35.054 --> 01:16:36.355
Octopus?

01:16:37.623 --> 01:16:40.392
What does that mean?
It's not a very good translation.

01:16:40.526 --> 01:16:42.094
No, there's nothing wrong
with the translation.

01:16:42.228 --> 01:16:43.896
Matthew's not that fluent.
And it's Cantonese.

01:16:44.029 --> 01:16:45.564
Just go with it
and fill in the blanks.

01:16:45.699 --> 01:16:47.032
And action.

01:16:47.667 --> 01:16:49.735
<i>It's all on Michael.
He's to blame.</i>

01:16:50.502 --> 01:16:51.904
<i>That is not a smart move.</i>

01:16:52.037 --> 01:16:54.006
Don't tell me
what a smart move is.

01:16:54.139 --> 01:16:55.274
<i>I beg for your pardon.</i>

01:16:55.407 --> 01:16:57.109
You heard me
perfectly well.

01:16:57.243 --> 01:16:59.778
<i>There will be repercussions
for Michael's actions.</i>

01:16:59.912 --> 01:17:01.547
You think you're
running things, do you?

01:17:02.047 --> 01:17:03.949
<i>Don't stroke my mouse hair.</i>

01:17:05.217 --> 01:17:08.320
- What does "mouse hair" mean?
- Yeah, I think what he means is don't jeopardize my deal,

01:17:08.454 --> 01:17:10.289
but I admit that one's
a bit of a googly.

01:17:10.422 --> 01:17:12.091
Then Matthew loses it a bit

01:17:12.224 --> 01:17:14.560
and his translation goes
completely out of the window.

01:17:14.694 --> 01:17:17.496
Something about springtime
and sweaters.

01:17:17.631 --> 01:17:19.131
I think what he means
is he's upset.

01:17:19.265 --> 01:17:20.634
<i>And then Dry Eye
says something,</i>

01:17:20.766 --> 01:17:22.268
<i>but some cunt
moved in front of me,</i>

01:17:22.401 --> 01:17:23.737
<i>so I didn't get that
either.</i>

01:17:23.869 --> 01:17:25.938
Your Cantonese
is dog shit,

01:17:26.071 --> 01:17:27.139
so I'm gonna say this
in English

01:17:27.273 --> 01:17:28.307
and I'm gonna say it once,

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.142
so listen to me,
Rubenstein.

01:17:32.712 --> 01:17:34.446
This is how
it's gonna play out.

01:17:35.814 --> 01:17:37.483
You're gonna
back the fuck off...

01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:40.152
and I'm gonna
take it all.

01:17:41.453 --> 01:17:44.189
And you will pay me
my respect.

01:17:45.291 --> 01:17:47.526
And there you have it.
That's all I've got.

01:17:47.661 --> 01:17:50.496
Sorry. Show's over.

01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:53.299
But I think
it's quite clear

01:17:53.432 --> 01:17:55.868
that they're not just
mah-jongg partners, are they?

01:17:56.435 --> 01:17:57.503
Mm?

01:18:05.077 --> 01:18:07.513
Not all of that
was clear, Fletcher.

01:18:07.647 --> 01:18:09.281
I mean,
according to you,

01:18:09.415 --> 01:18:11.751
we already know Matthew
wants to buy Michael out.

01:18:12.786 --> 01:18:16.255
- So why is that news?
- Oh, don't you worry, my darling.

01:18:16.388 --> 01:18:18.190
We are gonna
come to the news.

01:18:18.891 --> 01:18:21.593
<i>I'm approaching my climax.</i>

01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:29.601
Dry Eye.

01:18:30.135 --> 01:18:33.439
I trust you will make
Michael Pearson pay for this.

01:18:34.306 --> 01:18:36.275
You are
the dragon head now.

01:18:36.408 --> 01:18:38.177
Solidify your position.

01:18:39.646 --> 01:18:40.979
It will be done, Uncle.

01:18:42.081 --> 01:18:44.950
<i>So Dry Eye got the upgrade
he was after, didn't he, Raymond?</i>

01:18:45.084 --> 01:18:47.519
<i>The question is,
what was he gonna do with it</i>

01:18:47.654 --> 01:18:49.656
<i>now that he's
Billy Big Bollocks?</i>

01:18:49.789 --> 01:18:51.390
Give me ten minutes,
Ray.

01:18:52.524 --> 01:18:53.559
Boss.

01:19:07.473 --> 01:19:08.808
Hello, Ros.

01:19:08.941 --> 01:19:10.943
It's date night tonight,

01:19:11.076 --> 01:19:13.847
9:00 p.m., you and I,
River Cafe.

01:19:13.979 --> 01:19:16.248
Nine o'clock? I'll be there.

01:19:20.052 --> 01:19:21.620
We're closed.

01:19:21.755 --> 01:19:22.888
Hang up.

01:19:24.724 --> 01:19:25.759
No.

01:19:26.325 --> 01:19:27.426
<i>Hang the fucking phone up.</i>

01:19:27.559 --> 01:19:28.594
Who's there?

01:19:30.562 --> 01:19:32.097
Ros, who's there?

01:19:32.431 --> 01:19:33.599
<i>What you doing here,
Dry Eye?</i>

01:19:37.603 --> 01:19:39.438
It's warming up now,
isn't it?

01:19:39.571 --> 01:19:43.275
At this point, I'm guessing
that you didn't even know

01:19:43.409 --> 01:19:45.444
that Lord George
was dead yet,

01:19:45.577 --> 01:19:47.946
let alone
what Dry Eye was up to.

01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:50.549
Hello, Dry Eye.
What do you want?

01:20:02.961 --> 01:20:04.062
Fancy a boiled sweet?

01:20:04.731 --> 01:20:07.266
- No.
- Suit yourself.

01:20:15.574 --> 01:20:16.910
Who the fuck was he?

01:20:17.409 --> 01:20:19.211
<i>I'm not exactly
sure what happened next,</i>

01:20:19.344 --> 01:20:21.781
<i>because you two managed
to give me the slip.</i>

01:20:21.915 --> 01:20:23.949
They got Rosalind.
Call Roger.

01:20:25.617 --> 01:20:27.821
Oh, goody. Another bottle.

01:20:27.953 --> 01:20:30.088
Hold on. You were there?

01:20:32.792 --> 01:20:34.828
Yeah.
Of course I was there.

01:20:35.561 --> 01:20:38.932
He's not picking up. Maybe you
should put your seat belt on.

01:20:40.098 --> 01:20:42.100
Yeah, let me call Rosalind.
Let me do it.

01:20:43.602 --> 01:20:45.772
I got it.
Just watch the road.

01:20:46.605 --> 01:20:48.440
Now, Rosalind, don't be alarmed,

01:20:48.574 --> 01:20:50.275
but you're gonna
come with me

01:20:50.409 --> 01:20:52.645
until I can resolve all these
issues with your husband.

01:20:53.412 --> 01:20:54.814
I'm not going anywhere.

01:20:55.614 --> 01:20:57.483
She's not picking up.
It's just ringing.

01:20:57.616 --> 01:21:00.419
- Fuck.
- We could just slow down a little bit.

01:21:02.254 --> 01:21:03.622
Fuck!

01:21:18.337 --> 01:21:19.973
<i>You know how it works.</i>

01:21:20.673 --> 01:21:24.176
You either come with me or Tony
here is gonna make you come with me.

01:21:24.309 --> 01:21:27.012
You're in my office
under my roof.

01:21:27.145 --> 01:21:28.915
It's not your position
for Tony to do anything

01:21:29.047 --> 01:21:31.383
other than to fuck off back
from whence he came.

01:21:31.517 --> 01:21:33.151
Tony.

01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:37.724
What's that?
Is that a paperweight?

01:21:37.857 --> 01:21:41.360
Funny you should say that. Turns out
anything with weight can be a paperweight.

01:21:41.493 --> 01:21:43.663
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Well, that's up to you, isn't it?

01:21:43.796 --> 01:21:46.164
Either you do as I tell
you to and use the door,

01:21:46.298 --> 01:21:48.701
or I'm gonna shoot fat Tony
right between the eyes.

01:21:48.835 --> 01:21:50.837
You see, this gun's
only got two bullets,

01:21:50.970 --> 01:21:53.405
so I'm not gonna fuck about
illustrating its significance.

01:21:53.539 --> 01:21:55.274
You're gonna have to
trust me on that.

01:21:55.407 --> 01:21:57.209
The alternative
is a little bit absolute.

01:21:58.477 --> 01:22:00.379
I'm gonna have
to check your grammar on that.

01:22:00.847 --> 01:22:03.016
It can't be
just a little bit absolute.

01:22:03.148 --> 01:22:05.617
It either is or it isn't.

01:22:05.752 --> 01:22:08.855
Whatever it is,
I've lost my patience.

01:22:08.988 --> 01:22:12.859
I'm telling you, I will squeeze this
trigger and Tony will be no more.

01:22:12.992 --> 01:22:14.861
Tony.

01:22:16.228 --> 01:22:18.765
Listen to me, cunt.
You take one step forward,

01:22:18.898 --> 01:22:20.733
it'll be the last fucking
step you ever take.

01:22:20.867 --> 01:22:22.234
Tony, get on it.

01:22:57.569 --> 01:22:58.972
I fucking dare you.

01:23:01.674 --> 01:23:02.775
Just calm down.

01:23:03.876 --> 01:23:04.911
I'm leaving.

01:23:12.584 --> 01:23:14.053
I guess that's
your two bullets, eh?

01:23:15.021 --> 01:23:16.321
Rosalind!

01:23:30.268 --> 01:23:31.638
Rosalind!

01:23:38.143 --> 01:23:39.846
Stay fucking still!

01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:48.054
Hello, babe.

01:24:04.937 --> 01:24:06.005
Hello, love.

01:24:06.673 --> 01:24:08.908
<i>So you're
basing your whole crescendo</i>

01:24:09.441 --> 01:24:11.077
on a figment
of your imagination.

01:24:11.209 --> 01:24:14.981
I'm basing my whole crescendo
on the sum of its parts.

01:24:15.114 --> 01:24:17.349
A few minor details aside,
I wouldn't have any trouble at all

01:24:17.482 --> 01:24:21.453
selling this juicy peach
of a drama to Big Dave.

01:24:21.586 --> 01:24:23.488
He'd cream
his fucking panties.

01:24:23.622 --> 01:24:26.291
You're too smart to be
blackmailing us, Fletcher.

01:24:26.425 --> 01:24:29.128
Yes, yes, and obviously I've
taken precautionary measures.

01:24:29.428 --> 01:24:32.832
You can do all kinds of
horrible things to me if you want.

01:24:33.331 --> 01:24:35.134
I might even enjoy them.

01:24:35.267 --> 01:24:37.870
But you'd have to leave the
country and never come back.

01:24:38.004 --> 01:24:39.972
So is that the story over
now, Fletcher?

01:24:40.106 --> 01:24:43.810
All this, this whole buildup,
was leading to this next part.

01:24:43.943 --> 01:24:47.180
This is the news that
you were asking about before.

01:24:47.312 --> 01:24:48.748
Ready?

01:24:49.347 --> 01:24:50.382
Matthew.

01:24:51.216 --> 01:24:53.019
<i>He's gonna need some people
to run his business here</i>

01:24:53.152 --> 01:24:55.054
<i>when he buys it
from Michael, right?</i>

01:24:55.188 --> 01:24:57.990
He's gonna need a reliable pair of
hands, someone like you.

01:24:58.124 --> 01:25:00.093
Hmm. So why didn't he
ask you, Raymond?

01:25:00.225 --> 01:25:02.594
I don't know.
It's none of my business.

01:25:02.729 --> 01:25:04.262
Because, I'll tell you,

01:25:04.897 --> 01:25:07.399
he already had someone
earmarked for the role.

01:25:08.201 --> 01:25:11.336
<i>Dry Eye.
He promised Dry Eye the job,</i>

01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:15.240
but only if Dry Eye helped drive
down the price of Mickey's business.

01:25:15.373 --> 01:25:19.746
You see, it was Matthew who told Dry
Eye the location of Mickey's farm,

01:25:19.879 --> 01:25:22.247
<i>so he could steal
his white widow super cheese</i>

01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:24.650
to cause ripples
and reduce the market value.

01:25:24.784 --> 01:25:27.452
And that is why Phuc,
in turn,

01:25:27.586 --> 01:25:31.824
<i>got those juice-swilling,
acne-backed muscle Marys to do the job.</i>

01:25:31.958 --> 01:25:33.826
<i>It was Matthew</i>

01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:36.729
who set this whole
train of events off.

01:25:37.529 --> 01:25:39.799
<i>But what he did not
plan on, you see...</i>

01:25:39.932 --> 01:25:41.634
Fuck you,
you old cunt!

01:25:41.768 --> 01:25:43.069
I'll piss on your grave.

01:25:45.738 --> 01:25:47.339
<i>...was Dry Eye...</i>

01:25:49.242 --> 01:25:50.475
killing Lord George.

01:25:51.944 --> 01:25:55.580
<i>Now, Dry Eye does not want to be
subservient to Matthew anymore.</i>

01:25:55.715 --> 01:25:57.116
Doesn't wanna be
subservient to anyone.

01:25:57.250 --> 01:25:59.018
This is how
it's gonna play out.

01:26:00.552 --> 01:26:02.354
You're gonna
back the fuck off

01:26:02.889 --> 01:26:04.857
and I'm gonna
take it all.

01:26:04.991 --> 01:26:08.694
Dry Eye likes the smell of
power and does not like Matthew.

01:26:08.828 --> 01:26:13.199
<i>So, the little dragon needed a gentle
reminder of who was really running things.</i>

01:26:13.331 --> 01:26:15.367
You've been in this paddling
pool for two minutes.

01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:18.336
I've been swimming in the ocean
with the sharks for 20 years.

01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:21.040
I'll tell you
how this plays out.

01:26:21.774 --> 01:26:23.276
You will drown...

01:26:24.409 --> 01:26:27.146
and then my Mossad crabs
will eat you.

01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:32.151
And this, my love, is why I want
my hard-earned 20 million pounds.

01:26:32.285 --> 01:26:38.323
Because not only do I know exactly
how Mickey's business operates,

01:26:38.456 --> 01:26:42.762
but I also know that the very
man he's trying to sell it to

01:26:42.895 --> 01:26:45.530
is trying to force him
into selling it on the cheap

01:26:45.665 --> 01:26:48.600
and has indirectly
started a war.

01:26:49.302 --> 01:26:52.638
So, you see, I think you should be
calling me your trusted consigliere,

01:26:53.605 --> 01:26:55.141
or your spy
behind the lines,

01:26:55.274 --> 01:26:59.278
your intellectual
reconnaissance, if you prefer.

01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:02.181
I'm impressed.

01:27:03.415 --> 01:27:05.617
You certainly know
more than I do.

01:27:05.751 --> 01:27:08.486
I'm impressed not only
by your information,

01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:10.723
but by your imagination.

01:27:11.489 --> 01:27:12.725
Thank you very much.

01:27:15.328 --> 01:27:17.129
So you've got 72 hours.

01:27:18.164 --> 01:27:21.366
And I would just reiterate
that if anything happens to me,

01:27:21.499 --> 01:27:23.836
I do have my insurance policy
in place.

01:27:24.303 --> 01:27:27.073
Everything will go to Big Dave,
and from him to the public,

01:27:27.206 --> 01:27:29.175
and you, my love,
will go to Mars.

01:27:29.308 --> 01:27:32.377
So, strong recommendation,
just pay up

01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:38.050
and watch me recede into the
sunset blowing kisses, yes?

01:27:41.087 --> 01:27:45.258
Well, then, time to use the
door, you black bastard.

01:27:45.390 --> 01:27:47.727
Well, that's just silly, isn't
it, 'cause I'm not black.

01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:50.730
No, but your fucking soul is,
you dark cunt.

01:27:52.932 --> 01:27:56.035
Now, out of my house,
'cause I'm going to bed.

01:27:58.536 --> 01:28:00.039
Can I come with you?

01:28:01.406 --> 01:28:05.443
No, but you can go smoke the exhaust
pipe in the back of your hearse.

01:28:07.113 --> 01:28:08.546
I might come anyway.

01:28:10.116 --> 01:28:12.752
You'll just hear me
scratching about in the dark,

01:28:13.451 --> 01:28:15.221
wanking into a hanky.

01:28:20.425 --> 01:28:22.962
All right, so, 20 million.

01:28:24.096 --> 01:28:25.998
You've got 72 hours,
starting now.

01:28:26.933 --> 01:28:29.601
Ticktock, ticktock.

01:28:31.137 --> 01:28:32.371
And I'm gone.

01:28:35.408 --> 01:28:36.943
Ticktock.

01:28:40.947 --> 01:28:42.648
Ticktock.

01:28:52.391 --> 01:28:54.060
He's just left.

01:28:54.193 --> 01:28:55.795
He thinks he's very clever.

01:28:56.561 --> 01:28:57.997
Start with Big Dave.

01:29:03.202 --> 01:29:05.304
Now, you keep this
between you and me, Hammy,

01:29:05.438 --> 01:29:08.007
but Fletcher's been in touch.
He says he's got what we need.

01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:10.608
Careful, boss. Fletcher's ass
belongs to the highest bidder.

01:29:10.743 --> 01:29:12.610
Yeah.
He says he wants 150 grand.

01:29:12.745 --> 01:29:15.114
But if it's proper, it's worth
a whole week's exclusive.

01:29:15.247 --> 01:29:16.514
Well, what does he
have exactly?

01:29:16.649 --> 01:29:18.084
He was just
tickling me nuts,

01:29:18.217 --> 01:29:19.517
but he says
he wants to meet Saturday.

01:29:19.652 --> 01:29:20.753
So keep it free.

01:29:23.155 --> 01:29:24.522
Yeah, pronto.

01:29:31.563 --> 01:29:34.200
Oi, you can't park there,
mate. Move the van.

01:29:34.333 --> 01:29:36.469
Don't worry, friend.
We'll be gone in a minute.

01:29:36.601 --> 01:29:38.804
We're not a newspaper.
We're a blood sport.

01:29:38.938 --> 01:29:40.572
Oi, Russ. Move the van.

01:29:40.706 --> 01:29:42.241
I'm on it, boss.

01:29:43.042 --> 01:29:44.677
Move it. Now.

01:29:45.478 --> 01:29:48.580
- I said in a minute.
- Oi, spunk bubble.

01:29:48.714 --> 01:29:50.649
Get rid of
the fucking van.

01:29:55.888 --> 01:29:59.225
I'm warning you,
Russ does karate.

01:30:03.829 --> 01:30:07.099
Careful, boys.
Russ does karate.

01:30:08.533 --> 01:30:10.936
Russ, if you know
what's good for you,

01:30:11.070 --> 01:30:13.039
get in the car now.

01:30:16.509 --> 01:30:19.577
Sorry, boss.
I'm only a blue belt.

01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:22.515
You melt.

01:30:24.050 --> 01:30:27.386
Now what? We're making
a YouTube movie? Eh?

01:30:28.087 --> 01:30:29.355
Break dancing?

01:30:30.189 --> 01:30:33.426
I'm warning you.
I'm fucking powerful.

01:30:33.558 --> 01:30:36.695
We know all that. Why don't you tell
us all about it in the back of the van?

01:30:36.829 --> 01:30:39.865
I'm not going.
I'm not fucking... No!

01:30:39.999 --> 01:30:41.867
No.

01:30:42.001 --> 01:30:43.669
Get him in there.

01:30:46.472 --> 01:30:47.740
Unbelievable.

01:30:52.678 --> 01:30:54.113
Well, well, well.

01:30:57.683 --> 01:30:59.752
You're all right, Big Dave.
You're in safe hands now.

01:30:59.885 --> 01:31:02.620
- No need to panic, okay?
- Who are you?

01:31:02.755 --> 01:31:04.589
Don't worry about that
right now.

01:31:05.758 --> 01:31:07.259
Look...

01:31:07.393 --> 01:31:09.028
Look, whatever's
gone on here,

01:31:09.161 --> 01:31:10.729
I just need
to get back to work.

01:31:10.863 --> 01:31:12.765
If you let me go,
I'll just forget all about it.

01:31:12.898 --> 01:31:15.868
I'll have you back to work
in short order, my friend.

01:31:16.001 --> 01:31:17.303
Now, I believe
you're a reporter.

01:31:18.737 --> 01:31:20.605
And there's something
I wanna report to you.

01:31:20.739 --> 01:31:22.775
Now, it seems for
this brief moment in time

01:31:22.908 --> 01:31:25.111
I've found my way
into the film business,

01:31:25.244 --> 01:31:29.949
and last night I made a film with
an impressively sized farmyard pig.

01:31:33.953 --> 01:31:36.422
Morning, sir.
Two cups of tea.

01:31:36.555 --> 01:31:39.091
One with sugar, one without.

01:31:39.225 --> 01:31:41.193
All right, lads,
go on, give us a minute.

01:31:44.063 --> 01:31:45.998
There are some wet
wipes there over your shoulder.

01:31:46.132 --> 01:31:48.534
Your clothes are neatly folded
there on the bench.

01:31:48.667 --> 01:31:52.304
Now, in due course, you're gonna
press the space bar on this computer

01:31:52.438 --> 01:31:55.941
and you're gonna witness your
participation in said film.

01:31:56.075 --> 01:31:59.478
Now, that little drug we
gave you last night really...

01:32:01.147 --> 01:32:02.882
loosened up
your inhibitions, man.

01:32:03.616 --> 01:32:07.119
The only thing you'll need to do to
stop this little creative expression

01:32:07.253 --> 01:32:09.722
from becoming
a social media sensation

01:32:09.855 --> 01:32:12.691
is lose any interest you have
in the future of Mickey Pearson.

01:32:14.093 --> 01:32:15.995
I'm gonna leave you now
to clean yourself up.

01:32:17.930 --> 01:32:19.532
Space bar, yeah?
Have a hot drink as well.

01:32:19.665 --> 01:32:21.700
It might make you feel
a little bit better.

01:32:21.834 --> 01:32:23.569
It was a fucking rough night
for you.

01:32:25.371 --> 01:32:26.972
Enjoy the show.

01:32:33.445 --> 01:32:37.583
<i>âª Old
MacDonald Had a farm, e-i-e-i-o âª</i>

01:32:37.716 --> 01:32:40.386
<i>âª And on that farm He had a pig... âª</i>

01:32:40.519 --> 01:32:42.755
- How's your man, then, Coach?
- Ah, he'll survive.

01:32:42.888 --> 01:32:44.890
Wouldn't have been the pig I would have chosen, though.

01:32:49.461 --> 01:32:50.963
We know what bit that is.

01:32:52.698 --> 01:32:54.733
<i>Let me tickle that belly.</i>

01:32:54.867 --> 01:32:57.637
<i>You are so naughty.</i>

01:32:57.770 --> 01:33:00.139
- Good Lord.
- I was there and I'm still shocked.

01:33:00.706 --> 01:33:02.408
<i>Squeal for me, piggy.</i>

01:33:02.541 --> 01:33:05.211
- Is that who I think it is?
- Yeah, it certainly is.

01:33:07.813 --> 01:33:09.081
And that's your doing?

01:33:09.215 --> 01:33:11.016
<i>Where is that applesauce?</i>

01:33:11.617 --> 01:33:13.485
You can't unsee it
once you've seen it, can you?

01:33:13.619 --> 01:33:15.588
No, you can't unsee it.
It's nightmare fuel.

01:33:15.721 --> 01:33:16.889
That will be with me forever.

01:33:18.290 --> 01:33:19.725
That story
won't be running.

01:33:22.161 --> 01:33:24.930
Right. I've got one more
thing I need you to do.

01:33:25.064 --> 01:33:27.766
Ah, look,
before you continue, Ray,

01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:32.004
I train lads to be good lads.
I'm not a fucking gangster.

01:33:32.137 --> 01:33:35.507
Now, I've been forced to do some
gangster things, that's okay.

01:33:35.642 --> 01:33:37.677
But I'm not the gift
that keeps on giving.

01:33:37.810 --> 01:33:40.412
So with the greatest respect,
I'll do this one last thing for you

01:33:40.546 --> 01:33:42.014
and then that's it.

01:33:42.147 --> 01:33:45.551
<i>No mÃ¡s.</i>
Three strikes and I'm out.

01:33:52.358 --> 01:33:54.426
- Everything all right, Coach?
- No, Ernie, it isn't.

01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:57.129
You need to understand the
severity of your actions.

01:34:04.236 --> 01:34:05.838
Dave, an hour.

01:34:05.971 --> 01:34:07.006
Okay, boss.

01:34:12.044 --> 01:34:14.146
Thank you
for the grand tour.

01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:15.814
I'm a believer.

01:34:15.948 --> 01:34:17.283
Thank you, chaps.

01:34:19.618 --> 01:34:22.021
Now, are we ready
to finalize the numbers?

01:34:22.821 --> 01:34:23.922
We already have.

01:34:24.056 --> 01:34:25.491
Mm...

01:34:25.624 --> 01:34:27.761
The situation's changed,
Michael.

01:34:27.893 --> 01:34:30.462
- The market's changed.
- How so?

01:34:30.996 --> 01:34:34.600
The exit value of your business
needs to be recalculated.

01:34:35.334 --> 01:34:37.269
Please, be specific.

01:34:37.403 --> 01:34:39.305
Oh, I will be.

01:34:39.438 --> 01:34:42.776
You're asking 400 for 12 locations
and a distribution network,

01:34:42.908 --> 01:34:45.377
which was a fair valuation
at the time.

01:34:45.511 --> 01:34:48.314
But when one of those
locations was compromised,

01:34:48.447 --> 01:34:50.784
the value of all those
locations were compromised

01:34:50.916 --> 01:34:52.618
and this obviously
affects the price.

01:34:53.452 --> 01:34:57.089
Your skunk farm was a fucking viral
sensation on YouTube, Michael.

01:34:57.222 --> 01:34:59.693
And when Johnny Law starts
sniffing, which he will,

01:34:59.825 --> 01:35:01.927
all of those locations
will have to cease production

01:35:02.061 --> 01:35:05.831
for, I'd say, at least 12 months
at a cost of 100 million net p.a.,

01:35:05.964 --> 01:35:08.668
before marking down the loss of
staff, relocation and site rentals.

01:35:08.802 --> 01:35:10.602
- You still with me?
- Yes, I'm following.

01:35:10.737 --> 01:35:12.871
It will take
at least three years

01:35:13.005 --> 01:35:16.475
to get your supply, distribution
and demand back to full capacity.

01:35:16.608 --> 01:35:20.346
Your staffing costs are 25% of
your 100 million operational cost,

01:35:20.479 --> 01:35:24.049
so that's 25 million per annum
for three annums.

01:35:24.183 --> 01:35:26.518
And location rental
at 15 million a year,

01:35:26.653 --> 01:35:30.690
that's a 120 GBP bite
right there.

01:35:30.824 --> 01:35:33.392
Your unit economics
have taken a hit,

01:35:33.525 --> 01:35:38.063
and forecasting out your top-line growth
margin in the current inimical climate,

01:35:38.197 --> 01:35:41.467
I calculate what was worth
400 million a month ago

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:46.071
must now be valued
at an anemic, mm... 130.

01:35:47.306 --> 01:35:51.043
You see, it's not about the
first domino that fell, Michael.

01:35:51.877 --> 01:35:53.045
It's about the last.

01:35:55.381 --> 01:35:56.448
Please.

01:35:59.985 --> 01:36:02.722
I like you, Michael.
You're a good chap.

01:36:03.522 --> 01:36:07.226
And if you want me to help you out of
this hole you've found yourself in,

01:36:07.861 --> 01:36:10.896
I can pay you
100 million dollars today.

01:36:11.897 --> 01:36:14.366
It's a good offer
and it's real,

01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:16.636
and I'll do this
because I'm your friend.

01:36:16.770 --> 01:36:19.873
My accountant can transfer
the fee within the hour.

01:36:20.774 --> 01:36:22.809
I like your domino analogy.

01:36:24.543 --> 01:36:28.580
The question I ask is,
who tumbled the first domino?

01:36:29.214 --> 01:36:32.317
I'm afraid that's not my
concern or my business, Michael.

01:36:32.451 --> 01:36:34.286
At the risk
of contradicting you,

01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:38.390
it is very much your business,
and certainly your concern.

01:36:39.859 --> 01:36:41.326
Only you made one mistake.

01:36:42.695 --> 01:36:43.830
That being?

01:36:44.430 --> 01:36:47.399
You seem to have mistaken me
for some kind of a cunt.

01:36:49.234 --> 01:36:51.638
Let me introduce you
to the first domino.

01:36:55.708 --> 01:37:00.379
It's a tad dramatic, isn't it,
corpses in freezers? Who is this man?

01:37:00.512 --> 01:37:02.548
What's he got to do with
anything that I'm talking about?

01:37:02.682 --> 01:37:05.284
I take it with that statement
you are in denial

01:37:05.417 --> 01:37:07.986
of so-said relationship
with this frozen Chinaman?

01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:10.289
Well, of course
I'm in denial of it.

01:37:10.422 --> 01:37:14.092
I don't have relationships
with dead, frozen Chinamen.

01:37:14.226 --> 01:37:17.797
Best not to be glib at this time
in the proceedings, Matthew.

01:37:21.533 --> 01:37:23.770
Don't bother looking
for your Mossad crabs.

01:37:23.903 --> 01:37:26.338
This is a fish market.
They have found a home.

01:37:26.873 --> 01:37:29.408
To be clear,
I do not know that man.

01:37:31.711 --> 01:37:33.512
<i>I'll tell you
how this plays out.</i>

01:37:34.112 --> 01:37:38.685
<i>You will drown and then
my Mossad crabs will eat you.</i>

01:37:38.818 --> 01:37:42.120
So while you were discussing
who would take over my business

01:37:42.254 --> 01:37:43.756
after you fucked it,

01:37:44.724 --> 01:37:47.794
you somehow mistook so-said
Chinaman for someone else?

01:37:49.461 --> 01:37:53.499
Business is business, Michael.
It's nothing personal.

01:37:53.633 --> 01:37:55.969
While I am not emotional
about the money,

01:37:56.101 --> 01:37:59.873
there is a price indebted to me for
the blood I've gotten on my hands

01:38:00.005 --> 01:38:03.408
restoring order to the
untidiness that you created,

01:38:03.542 --> 01:38:05.177
and that price,
according to you...

01:38:05.310 --> 01:38:09.348
400 minus 130...
is 270 million dollars.

01:38:09.481 --> 01:38:12.551
And I'm keeping
the business,

01:38:13.853 --> 01:38:16.990
while you are
getting in the freezer.

01:38:17.657 --> 01:38:20.760
And you will make that transaction if
you want to get out of the freezer.

01:38:20.894 --> 01:38:25.364
It is 25 below zero in there,
so I assume you'll last about an hour.

01:38:25.497 --> 01:38:27.266
That said,
I wouldn't fuck about,

01:38:27.399 --> 01:38:29.568
because frostbite is very
expensive on the fingers and toes,

01:38:29.702 --> 01:38:33.539
so I would type as quickly as possible
while you have the use of them.

01:38:34.239 --> 01:38:36.341
- Uh...
- After you've attended to that indiscretion,

01:38:36.475 --> 01:38:40.345
you can then deal with the next
consequence of your shortsightedness.

01:38:40.914 --> 01:38:44.884
As stated,
I am not emotional about the money.

01:38:47.586 --> 01:38:51.256
But I am emotional about the fact that
someone laid their hands on my wife.

01:38:54.593 --> 01:38:55.862
My wife!

01:38:58.463 --> 01:39:01.901
No amount of money on God's green earth
can pay for that transgression, Matthew.

01:39:02.035 --> 01:39:03.602
No, for that...

01:39:07.472 --> 01:39:08.708
I want a pound of flesh.

01:39:09.876 --> 01:39:10.944
A pound of flesh?

01:39:11.076 --> 01:39:12.611
It matters not to me

01:39:12.745 --> 01:39:14.747
where on your anatomy
it is withdrawn from.

01:39:15.682 --> 01:39:18.885
If you don't have the stomach
to take it for yourself,

01:39:19.018 --> 01:39:21.119
big Bunny here
is very adept with a knife,

01:39:21.253 --> 01:39:23.088
and, as you can see,
he's dressed for the weather.

01:39:23.221 --> 01:39:27.526
But a penny short
or a gram shy...

01:39:28.928 --> 01:39:31.363
and that freezer door
does not open.

01:39:31.496 --> 01:39:32.531
Am I clear?

01:39:33.666 --> 01:39:34.701
Good.

01:39:35.768 --> 01:39:37.436
- Bunny.
- Incoming.

01:39:50.215 --> 01:39:52.618
What, is it Wagyu again
for breakfast, Raymond?

01:39:54.954 --> 01:39:58.624
Aren't you gonna introduce me to your
mysterious and slightly menacing friend?

01:40:03.997 --> 01:40:06.099
What's that for?
Is that for my money?

01:40:08.567 --> 01:40:09.702
Where's my money, Raymond?

01:40:09.836 --> 01:40:11.303
There's your payment.

01:40:15.108 --> 01:40:16.608
Go on, take a look.

01:40:16.743 --> 01:40:18.610
Thank you,
mysterious stranger.

01:40:28.755 --> 01:40:31.289
Well, that's disappointing, 'cause that
doesn't look like 20 million pounds.

01:40:31.423 --> 01:40:34.459
It's more interesting than that,
your insurance policy,

01:40:34.593 --> 01:40:37.997
all the photos, all the bodies,
all the skeletons, all the filth.

01:40:38.131 --> 01:40:42.367
It's not the only one,
darling. I'm not a mong.

01:40:42.501 --> 01:40:44.804
What do you think's in that,
you fucking eejit?

01:40:45.672 --> 01:40:47.807
Of course we were
aware of what Matthew was up to.

01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:49.676
We're not complete
fucking idiots.

01:40:51.878 --> 01:40:54.647
I've been onto you
for a long time, Fletcher.

01:40:55.614 --> 01:40:57.684
I knew you'd been following Michael.

01:40:57.817 --> 01:40:59.451
<i>They're very similar,
our jobs.</i>

01:41:00.019 --> 01:41:02.254
<i>Only I'm better at it
than you are.</i>

01:41:03.956 --> 01:41:07.526
I knew when you came over that night that
you'd only be there for half an hour...

01:41:08.393 --> 01:41:10.328
<i>Buenas tardes, Raymondo.</i>

01:41:10.462 --> 01:41:13.532
...to tell me how clever you
are and try to blackmail us.

01:41:14.266 --> 01:41:16.535
I've got some very important
information to impart to you, Raymond.

01:41:16.669 --> 01:41:20.173
I also knew you couldn't
resist a Â£1500 single malt,

01:41:20.305 --> 01:41:23.710
an Â£80 Wagyu steak and a
state-of-the-art smokeless barbie

01:41:24.276 --> 01:41:26.913
- that even keeps your feet warm.
- I love a barbie.

01:41:27.046 --> 01:41:29.916
I promise you, you will regret
this if you don't hear it.

01:41:30.049 --> 01:41:32.685
And when the Scotch
got into your cold veins,

01:41:32.819 --> 01:41:35.520
you lost the benefit
of your sharp instincts.

01:41:35.988 --> 01:41:38.223
Oh, goody. Another bottle.

01:41:38.356 --> 01:41:40.893
Can you tell the mysterious
gentleman to relax?

01:41:41.027 --> 01:41:44.063
Because I promise you, you will regret it
if you don't hear this. Sit down, my love.

01:41:44.197 --> 01:41:47.599
See, I kept you there 'cause I needed
to know about Matthew and Dry Eye.

01:41:48.801 --> 01:41:51.838
<i>Took us a while to find
your insurance policies.</i>

01:41:53.505 --> 01:41:55.540
<i>'Cause you're
a naughty squirrel, Fletcher.</i>

01:41:56.475 --> 01:41:58.610
Fletcher, shoes off inside.

01:41:58.745 --> 01:42:00.046
Yes, Mommy.

01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:04.416
<i>But it was made a lot easier after
I planted a tracker in your shoe.</i>

01:42:08.888 --> 01:42:11.090
<i>You're never gonna be
a predator with us, Fletcher.</i>

01:42:12.959 --> 01:42:14.794
You're always
gonna be prey.

01:42:16.028 --> 01:42:19.397
So that's it. Three strikes.
We're good, right?

01:42:22.101 --> 01:42:25.238
- I'll see you around.
- With the greatest respect, I hope not.

01:42:31.576 --> 01:42:35.982
Now, Fletcher,
what were you saying?

01:42:36.716 --> 01:42:39.284
It wasn't
Lord George that was after Mickey,

01:42:39.417 --> 01:42:41.854
or Dry Eye, or Matthew.

01:42:42.989 --> 01:42:44.322
Do you wanna know who it was?

01:42:48.961 --> 01:42:50.163
I've got photos.

01:42:52.899 --> 01:42:54.767
Right.
You've got 30 seconds.

01:42:54.901 --> 01:42:55.935
Thank you, darling.

01:42:57.970 --> 01:42:59.806
Fuck.

01:43:01.573 --> 01:43:03.009
Primetime,
what is it, son?

01:43:03.142 --> 01:43:05.945
Coach, we're gonna take
care of this for you.

01:43:06.078 --> 01:43:07.445
Ernie's got a plan.

01:43:07.713 --> 01:43:09.414
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:43:09.548 --> 01:43:12.785
The Michael situation.
We're gonna sort it.

01:43:14.553 --> 01:43:16.155
Primetime, listen... Prime...

01:43:17.622 --> 01:43:18.590
Jesus.

01:43:29.735 --> 01:43:31.503
<i>Now, you
remember Aslan, don't you?</i>

01:43:32.138 --> 01:43:34.640
The young gentleman
you kept in the freezer?

01:43:37.109 --> 01:43:41.647
Well, this is Aslan Senior,
Russian oligarch.

01:43:43.149 --> 01:43:45.350
<i>Ex-KGB. Made all
his money in gas pipes.</i>

01:43:45.483 --> 01:43:48.688
And he's extremely sad that his
one-and-only son fell out of a window.

01:43:49.155 --> 01:43:50.656
Oh, shit.

01:43:50.957 --> 01:43:52.859
And I fear that where
they failed before, Raymond,

01:43:52.992 --> 01:43:55.194
they're not gonna fail again.

01:43:55.328 --> 01:43:57.330
And how do you know
all this?

01:43:57.462 --> 01:44:00.666
Because someone told them everything
they want to know about Michael,

01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:03.468
and that someone is me.

01:44:04.670 --> 01:44:05.872
Go on.

01:44:06.839 --> 01:44:09.574
<i>So I said I'd tell them
where Michael was for a price.</i>

01:44:10.475 --> 01:44:14.280
But that money was pending till
after, you know, the deed was done.

01:44:16.249 --> 01:44:18.050
<i>And then when they
messed up the first time,</i>

01:44:18.184 --> 01:44:21.519
I had a little rethink and came
up with my version 2.0 plan,

01:44:21.654 --> 01:44:23.555
which is
when I came to see you.

01:44:23.689 --> 01:44:26.391
You see, get my 20 mils
off Michael first

01:44:26.524 --> 01:44:30.930
and then, after the event,
get paid again, double bubble.

01:44:31.063 --> 01:44:34.466
But you and your mysterious friend
put paid to that, so well done, you.

01:44:35.268 --> 01:44:36.769
Why did you just
look at your watch?

01:44:38.237 --> 01:44:41.774
Well, it's like I say.
The Russians are gonna clean house.

01:44:41.908 --> 01:44:44.977
And you are part of
that house, Raymond.

01:44:45.111 --> 01:44:48.080
They're gonna get Michael when he comes
out of his meeting at the fish market.

01:44:49.115 --> 01:44:51.717
And they are coming here.
So you see what I've done there?

01:44:52.218 --> 01:44:54.053
By telling you,
I've saved your lives.

01:44:54.186 --> 01:44:56.155
Which I think in turn
saves mine, doesn't it?

01:44:56.289 --> 01:44:58.057
Don't fucking move.

01:45:06.032 --> 01:45:07.133
Dave.

01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:09.001
Dave?

01:45:18.044 --> 01:45:19.278
No Dave.

01:45:24.383 --> 01:45:25.418
Fuck.

01:45:30.890 --> 01:45:32.590
Fuck!

01:46:13.099 --> 01:46:14.066
Fuck.

01:46:30.783 --> 01:46:33.252
<i>So the Toddlers
spray the car with bullets,</i>

01:46:33.386 --> 01:46:35.154
killing the Russians.

01:46:36.188 --> 01:46:38.157
<i>The car rolls to a stop.</i>

01:46:39.458 --> 01:46:41.894
Smash cut to black. Titles.

01:46:43.396 --> 01:46:46.065
So, what happened
to Michael?

01:46:47.199 --> 01:46:48.533
<i>I need an ending.</i>

01:46:48.667 --> 01:46:50.269
<i>No, no, no, my darling.</i>

01:46:51.569 --> 01:46:53.039
<i>What you need...</i>

01:46:53.839 --> 01:46:55.241
is a sequel.

01:46:55.540 --> 01:46:58.377
Think it over. Have a read.
You know my fee.

01:46:58.511 --> 01:47:00.946
I'm off to La La
to talk to the competition.

01:47:01.546 --> 01:47:05.017
Think about that.
Got a plane to catch. And I'm gone.

01:47:10.089 --> 01:47:11.457
Good afternoon.

01:47:12.358 --> 01:47:15.694
So, it's Heathrow
Airport, please, Terminal 3,

01:47:15.828 --> 01:47:18.097
and thence
to sunny California.

01:47:20.299 --> 01:47:23.903
<i>Buenas tardes,
Fletcher-mondo.</i>

01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:27.540
Raymond. Well, well, well.

01:47:27.673 --> 01:47:29.542
A man of many vocations,
aren't you?

01:47:39.051 --> 01:47:41.520
Now, I want you to play
a game with me, Fletcher.

01:47:47.159 --> 01:47:48.394
He's got Fletcher.

01:47:50.196 --> 01:47:51.964
<i>If you wish to be
the king of the jungle,</i>

01:47:52.098 --> 01:47:54.467
<i>it's not enough
to act like a king.</i>

01:47:55.301 --> 01:47:56.969
<i>You must be the king.</i>

01:47:58.370 --> 01:48:00.306
<i>And there can be no doubt.</i>

01:48:00.439 --> 01:48:04.043
<i>Because doubt causes chaos
and one's own demise.</i>

01:48:05.845 --> 01:48:07.379
<i>My queen told me that.</i>

01:48:08.613 --> 01:48:09.915
Any chance?
