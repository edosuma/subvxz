<i>Hey, everybody,
it's five minutes</i>

02:55.925 --> 02:57.925
<i>before the big hour of 5:00
here on Frantic Friday.</i>

02:57.968 --> 03:00.346
<i>We're rockin' and rollin'
and shootin' those big 45s</i>

03:00.347 --> 03:03.099
<i>at KROK FM Drive at hometime.</i>

03:03.265 --> 03:05.109
<i>Everybody's crowding
out of downtown big D,</i>

03:05.268 --> 03:08.237
<i>so let's go to our KROK guy
in the sky, Doug Doogan,</i>

03:08.396 --> 03:11.526
<i>tune into Power 106FM
KROK chopper!</i>

03:11.692 --> 03:13.786
<i>Hey, Doug, what's it looking like
from up there?</i>

03:13.943 --> 03:16.990
<i>Hey, big buddy, things are
getting pretty jammed up down there.</i>

03:16.991 --> 03:20.491
<i>75 Central Expressway
is backed up all the way to LBJ</i>

03:20.658 --> 03:22.831
<i>and I-35 northbound is packed</i>

03:22.993 --> 03:26.715
<i>because everybody who is anybody
is headed toward the lake.</i>

03:26.872 --> 03:27.873
<i>This is Doug Doogan,</i>

03:28.040 --> 03:31.385
<i>and that's the whirly bird's-eye view
of the K-Wreck report.</i>

03:31.545 --> 03:33.388
<i>Drive carefully, Dallas,
and have a</i>...

03:35.465 --> 03:37.264
I hope I brought enough food
for this weekend.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.807
I'm really looking forward
to relaxing on the lake.

03:39.969 --> 03:42.644
I'm not worried, you always
bring enough food for an army.

03:42.805 --> 03:45.150
I'm leaving all my troubles
at the office.

03:45.307 --> 03:46.980
No phone, no work,

03:47.185 --> 03:50.485
just a quiet, peaceful weekend
at the lake.

03:53.817 --> 03:56.615
Paul, what's that?

03:57.695 --> 03:59.743
What the hell?

04:17.007 --> 04:19.225
Call the police.

04:20.802 --> 04:24.101
Paul, call 911.

04:25.223 --> 04:26.314
You bet.

04:27.475 --> 04:31.480
Call 'em. This ol' boy
just killed a motorcycle cop.

04:31.646 --> 04:32.692
I seen him.

04:37.235 --> 04:39.783
<i>- Switchboard.</i>
- Yeah, give me the police, please.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.619
<i>Police department.
Name, please.</i>

04:41.781 --> 04:43.909
This is Paul Loftus.

04:44.074 --> 04:46.452
<i>What's your location, sir?</i>

04:46.620 --> 04:49.840
I'm at Lake Dallas
at, uh, Cane's Fishing Lodge.

04:49.997 --> 04:52.750
<i>What's the nature
of your problem, sir?</i>

04:53.543 --> 04:55.966
I think there's been a murder.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.266
Captain Coldyron,
Detective Glorioso.

05:08.432 --> 05:10.526
This here is Detective Grotes
with the division.

05:10.685 --> 05:11.526
Are you ready, sir?

05:11.685 --> 05:14.235
We're going into the division
on this, Captain.

05:26.742 --> 05:29.872
Lean back and relax, sir.
You'll shower and shave downtown.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.540
It's gonna be a long night.

05:32.706 --> 05:34.754
Buckle up for safety, sir.

05:36.293 --> 05:39.548
Sure, you bet.

05:52.351 --> 05:55.896
<i>My name is Coldyron,
Barrett Coldyron.</i>

05:55.896 --> 05:57.990
<i>I'm a Captain
with the Dallas Police Department,</i>

05:58.149 --> 06:00.697
<i>in charge
of their tactical operations lab.</i>

06:00.860 --> 06:03.283
<i>Two days ago, I was considered
one of the leaders</i>

06:03.446 --> 06:05.699
<i>in the field of police robotics.</i>

06:05.865 --> 06:10.166
<i>Today, I'm thought of as a modern-day
Dr. Frankenstein.</i>

06:10.327 --> 06:12.456
<i>My objective was pure enough,</i>

06:12.622 --> 06:15.750
<i>to make the streets of the city
a little safer,</i>

06:15.916 --> 06:19.512
<i>where gangs of punks, dope dealers,
and the rest of society's scum</i>

06:19.512 --> 06:23.507
<i>could be effectively controlled
and hopefully eradicated.</i>

06:23.507 --> 06:26.807
<i>A controlled army of police robots
could stop the slaughter</i>

06:26.970 --> 06:29.894
<i>of the hundreds of policemen
who sacrificed their lives every year</i>

06:30.055 --> 06:32.899
<i>in the protection
of those they serve.</i>

06:33.058 --> 06:36.153
<i>But how do you stop
a killing machine gone berserk,</i>

06:36.353 --> 06:40.108
<i>with only a go button
and no compassion?</i>

06:40.274 --> 06:43.778
<i>This battle may have been lost,
but the war continues.</i>

06:43.944 --> 06:47.449
<i>There's just too much at stake
to give up now.</i>

06:47.615 --> 06:52.713
<i>A way must be found
to protect society from itself.</i>

06:53.872 --> 06:56.420
<i>Still another chance.</i>

06:56.582 --> 06:59.005
<i>Maybe it can be done.</i>

06:59.168 --> 07:00.716
<i>Just maybe.</i>

07:00.879 --> 07:02.588
Sir?

07:02.588 --> 07:05.341
Uh, yes, sir.

07:12.682 --> 07:15.151
We can gain entry
into every classified paper

07:15.310 --> 07:17.937
in the tactical operations lab,
Dr. Coldyron.

07:18.103 --> 07:19.901
We'd rather get it from you, though.

07:20.064 --> 07:23.819
Make no mistake,
we will do so in any event.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.577
Talk or not.

07:25.737 --> 07:28.411
You know that this isn't
an official debriefing.

07:28.572 --> 07:31.951
Officially not an arrest questioning.

07:32.117 --> 07:36.588
Then, please state so for the record,
Doctor... unofficially.

07:36.747 --> 07:37.920
Officially.

07:38.082 --> 07:40.084
Officially.

07:40.250 --> 07:42.218
For the record?

07:43.129 --> 07:44.755
Or for the mayor?

07:44.923 --> 07:47.391
Or the division commander?

07:47.550 --> 07:50.769
Or about 12 other
high-crotched Federales,

07:50.928 --> 07:53.182
perched behind a two-way mirror?

07:55.057 --> 07:59.312
<i>Last Thursday,
my life was a hell of a lot simpler.</i>

07:59.521 --> 08:03.151
<i>The day started
just like any other day.</i>

08:03.315 --> 08:07.240
<i>The fresh October morning breeze
blew across the ranch,</i>

08:07.444 --> 08:10.699
<i>the cattle were coming in
for the morning feeding,</i>

08:10.865 --> 08:12.365
<i>and a buttery morning sunlight</i>

08:12.367 --> 08:15.620
<i>painted a golden glow
through the ranch house windows.</i>

08:17.706 --> 08:20.709
<i>If I'd known then
what was about to happen,</i>

08:20.875 --> 08:23.343
<i>I'd have never crawled out of bed.</i>

11:36.321 --> 11:38.119
<i>Clearing these stumps
for pasture land</i>

11:38.280 --> 11:40.375
<i>has always been a chore.</i>

11:41.576 --> 11:45.375
<i>In the past, I've always used
nitro or dynamite,</i>

11:45.538 --> 11:49.040
<i>but this new primer chord explosive
lets me practice my rope,</i>

11:49.042 --> 11:52.091
<i>and, at the same time,
it blows the stumps away.</i>

12:02.846 --> 12:06.772
Hm, guess I'd better go back
to straight nitro.

12:20.365 --> 12:21.490
Hello.

12:21.490 --> 12:24.039
<i>Barrett?
Am I on that stupid squawk box?</i>

12:24.201 --> 12:26.375
Hi, darling.
Can you hear me?

12:26.537 --> 12:27.788
<i>Like you're in a shower stall.</i>

12:27.956 --> 12:30.926
No, shaving.
You working today, babe?

12:31.083 --> 12:33.086
<i>- Give me a</i> reason.
- Money.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.879
<i>Oh, marry me,
and I won't need money.</i>

12:35.879 --> 12:37.052
Two can live as cheap as one

12:37.215 --> 12:38.932
if one doesn't eat.

12:39.091 --> 12:42.140
Speaking of which,
if you're a good girl and go to work,

12:42.302 --> 12:45.182
I'll cook the steaks
at your place tonight.

12:45.347 --> 12:48.692
<i>The perfect reason.
Call me from the lab.</i>

12:48.850 --> 12:49.898
<i>I love you.</i>

12:50.061 --> 12:53.235
I love you, too, Penny. Bye.

14:19.817 --> 14:20.783
<i>Ten years ago,</i>

14:20.942 --> 14:24.072
<i>when I founded the Dallas Police
Tactical Operations Lab,</i>

14:24.238 --> 14:27.081
<i>our objective was to research,
develop, and construct</i>

14:27.240 --> 14:30.370
<i>the nation's first
invincible police force.</i>

14:30.536 --> 14:33.085
<i>Even though we've made
incredible advancements,</i>

14:33.246 --> 14:37.047
<i>sometimes it's hard
to tell the boys from the toys.</i>

15:02.192 --> 15:03.660
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

15:03.860 --> 15:06.740
The research team
from our sister facility in L.A.

15:06.947 --> 15:12.580
is here today to sit in on a demonstration
of the new IA-1138 endo-chassis.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.293
Good. Say, you know,
I hope they brought

15:15.456 --> 15:18.835
the hydrogenated wheat germ
and desiccated liver this time.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.924
You just can't get it anywhere
like in L.A.

15:22.087 --> 15:26.173
Um, wheat germ
and desiccated liver, sir? What for?

15:26.174 --> 15:28.302
For my handball game, son.

15:28.469 --> 15:32.063
Keen reflexes, super endurance.

15:32.222 --> 15:33.394
Oh, yes, sir.

15:33.557 --> 15:36.152
- Don't ask stupid questions.
- Yeah.

15:36.309 --> 15:38.937
Handball, phew.

15:39.105 --> 15:43.201
Huh, I got your handball game
right here, pal.

15:47.572 --> 15:50.698
- 12:00 for lunch. Now, you be there.
- I'll be there.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.293
- Good morning, Captain Coldyron.
- Good morning.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.419
- How are you doing?
- Great.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.414
Whatever you say.

15:57.581 --> 16:01.381
Say, Hayley, why don't you hit me
with those seven digits for a date?

16:01.543 --> 16:04.717
- Would you?
- All right, I'm coming.

16:05.380 --> 16:07.678
Good morning, everyone.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.227
Welcome back to big D and DPD's

16:10.385 --> 16:13.355
Tactical Operations
Research and Development.

16:13.514 --> 16:15.562
I won't bore you
with re-chewed details,

16:15.725 --> 16:19.229
but since we're officially
on the record this morning,

16:19.394 --> 16:21.489
let me quickly recap our charter.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.775
We scientists are like degreed
science-fiction writers.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.611
We're all prognosticators
of the future.

16:27.778 --> 16:30.030
And since our particular
purpose of vision

16:30.197 --> 16:32.451
belongs to the creed
of law enforcement,

16:32.616 --> 16:36.120
we open in-roads into tomorrow
in ways and means

16:36.287 --> 16:40.962
of those who would serve and protect
justice and order.

16:41.125 --> 16:44.220
As you know, it's all my fault
that for the past three and a half years

16:44.378 --> 16:46.505
our public benefactors
have channeled funds

16:46.672 --> 16:48.673
into this development project.

17:00.852 --> 17:03.731
Dr. Bryan,
Wilson Institute of Hawthorne.

17:03.898 --> 17:08.074
Is this what your research
has led up to? A tin marionette?

17:08.236 --> 17:12.490
Not quite. Another scientist,
Dr. Steele from Houston,

17:12.656 --> 17:14.875
developed a super technology

17:15.076 --> 17:18.375
constructed combat chassis
out of an alloy.

17:18.538 --> 17:22.416
An unknown alloy,
simply given an obscure number.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.800
I'm Dr. Carl, also from Wilson.

17:25.001 --> 17:27.130
What's your intent
with some little known alloy?

17:27.131 --> 17:30.178
Is there some good vibration
to its molecular tonality

17:30.179 --> 17:31.517
you can utilize?

17:31.675 --> 17:33.973
Exactly. Watch.

17:44.521 --> 17:48.232
Dr. Michael of
East-West Test Center.

17:48.233 --> 17:52.535
The chassis, how can it animate
without gears or motors?

17:52.697 --> 17:56.326
I mean, I get around, but I've
never seen anything like this.

17:56.491 --> 17:59.621
This combat chassis has been issued
a prime directive, Doctor.

17:59.787 --> 18:02.631
Dr. Alan,
Jargon University of Malibu.

18:02.789 --> 18:06.714
Are you saying this thing could do
anything from aerobics to tai chi?

18:06.876 --> 18:10.346
Right, it can do karate
to full-field combat.

18:12.758 --> 18:15.477
Uh, Dr. Bruce,
Johnston Labs, Zuma Beach.

18:15.635 --> 18:17.479
God only knows this is spectacular,

18:17.637 --> 18:20.141
but what exactly
are we dealing with here?

18:20.307 --> 18:23.857
Molecular memory and learning.
All it needs is a supply.

18:24.060 --> 18:26.439
A current of electricity
as a catalyst.

18:26.605 --> 18:29.773
An inducer,
simulative brain impulse.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.777
In this case, a command.

18:31.943 --> 18:35.073
The metal itself has already been
taught the aerobic movement

18:35.239 --> 18:37.458
by the particular electrical impulse

18:37.616 --> 18:40.586
of the induced
corresponding command.

18:40.744 --> 18:44.124
Then the molecules move the chassis
into the remembered posture.

18:44.289 --> 18:48.545
The metal itself can learn,
remember, and teach itself.

18:48.711 --> 18:51.714
It doesn't need motors,
gears, and tubes.

18:51.881 --> 18:55.306
Just a flat place to stand
and a lever that's long enough,

18:55.468 --> 18:57.384
and it can move the world.

18:57.385 --> 19:00.515
Well, who are we
who create such a thing?

19:00.681 --> 19:02.523
Heroes and villains?

19:03.808 --> 19:06.278
The only difference
between a hero and a villain

19:06.436 --> 19:09.781
is the amount of compensation
they take for their services.

19:09.782 --> 19:12.948
At our pay scale,
I'd say we're heroes.

19:15.153 --> 19:17.233
What are you planning,
high-tech rock 'n' roll

19:17.280 --> 19:18.907
to the rescue
of the civil law and order?

19:19.115 --> 19:20.959
You're on my
wavelength, and you're right.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.833
And I've already wondered
if our creation

19:22.994 --> 19:25.292
is gonna rescue society
or destroy it.

19:25.455 --> 19:28.460
I think Dr. Frankenstein
must have felt the same way.

19:28.625 --> 19:31.253
He was full
of fine intentions himself, you know.

19:31.255 --> 19:34.347
Only he tried to harness death,
and we're trying to harness life.

19:35.173 --> 19:39.930
Either we control society
or it destroys itself.

19:40.971 --> 19:43.556
And next year, same time,
same place,

19:43.557 --> 19:45.525
if you'll be our guests again,

19:45.684 --> 19:48.438
you'll see the product
of the next phase of evolution.

19:48.604 --> 19:51.278
25 years from now,
if you'll come next fall,

19:51.440 --> 19:53.032
what you'll see
will be the only thing

19:53.233 --> 19:56.157
that stands
between humanity and itself.

19:56.319 --> 19:59.414
Remember, mankind is
bent on genocide,

19:59.573 --> 20:01.666
self-extermination.

20:01.826 --> 20:04.500
I will show you the only remedy.

20:05.078 --> 20:10.300
Dr. Coldyron, urgent phone call
for you in your office.

20:10.459 --> 20:13.294
It's division command, Buglar.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.296
Priority, line one.

20:15.297 --> 20:17.846
Bad, as usual?

20:18.008 --> 20:20.978
Worse than that.
He's swelled up like a poison toad.

20:21.178 --> 20:25.557
Hm, the man hasn't had a decent
bowel movement in a week.

20:25.724 --> 20:28.819
I told him to lay off
that home cooking.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.534
The man was 39 years old

20:35.692 --> 20:39.072
before he discovered gravy
wasn't a beverage.

20:40.948 --> 20:43.076
<i>Commander,
how nice to hear your voice.</i>

20:43.284 --> 20:45.787
Let's not spar
with the social amenities, Coldyron,

20:45.952 --> 20:47.625
and say we did.

20:47.788 --> 20:50.007
Now, down to business.

20:50.165 --> 20:55.047
Do you know who called me
at 5:00 a.m. this morning?

20:55.253 --> 20:57.847
Well, I'll tell you who, Doctor.

20:58.007 --> 21:01.056
Our benefactor, your meal ticket,

21:01.218 --> 21:04.768
Mr. Free Ride,
as you must think of him.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.978
The grim reaper,
as I think of him,

21:07.141 --> 21:09.894
Senator Donald D. Douglas.

21:10.059 --> 21:13.780
The man who gave you the shovel
you've been digging up graves with,

21:13.939 --> 21:15.486
<i>my friend.</i>

21:15.648 --> 21:18.277
Do you know
what he wanted to know?

21:18.443 --> 21:21.323
He wanted a progress report
on your project.

21:21.489 --> 21:23.115
And do you know what I said?

21:23.324 --> 21:27.124
Look, Commander Buglar, Earl,
I know what you're gonna say.

21:27.327 --> 21:31.208
No. No, you don't here, Doctor.

21:31.373 --> 21:36.003
No, I lied to the senator and said
everything was right on schedule.

21:36.170 --> 21:37.467
See, I had to lie to him

21:37.630 --> 21:41.009
because from day one,
you cut me out of it.

21:41.174 --> 21:45.351
You've hated me. You thought I was
nothing but a stupid paper jerker,

21:45.512 --> 21:47.059
a peasant.

21:47.263 --> 21:52.269
Well, I don't know how you're doing,
so I said everything is fine.

21:52.435 --> 21:54.233
Fine, fine, fine!

21:54.395 --> 21:58.445
Then he got cross with me, Barrett,
quite cross,

21:58.608 --> 22:02.364
and said, "No, Commander,
things are ahead of schedule",

22:02.529 --> 22:04.156
way ahead.

22:04.365 --> 22:07.115
In fact, we're close to fruition.

22:07.116 --> 22:11.337
"We're going to have product
in 60 days."

22:11.497 --> 22:13.750
Product?
Well, what the hell are you trying...?

22:13.915 --> 22:15.384
<i>You know what I told him?</i>

22:15.542 --> 22:17.715
<i>I said 60 days is impossible.</i>

22:17.877 --> 22:20.421
<i>Maybe 60 months.</i>

22:20.422 --> 22:23.675
<i>- Do you know what he called me?</i>
- What?

22:23.843 --> 22:26.266
Private citizen.

22:26.428 --> 22:28.806
- And do you know why?
<i>- Why?</i>

22:28.972 --> 22:32.477
Because he can make me
a private citizen in 60 seconds!

22:32.643 --> 22:33.682
Now, why would he do that?

22:33.769 --> 22:37.490
For the same reason a dog
licks itself, boy, because it can.

22:37.647 --> 22:40.697
And because he's got a hold of me
in the same place.

22:40.859 --> 22:43.032
And you have any idea why?

22:43.194 --> 22:44.366
No, you don't,

22:44.529 --> 22:47.078
because you're a lab jockey,
and I'm a politician.

22:47.240 --> 22:50.414
Well, let me lay it out
plain for you, son.

22:50.577 --> 22:54.458
The senator found himself
a holy grail three and a half years ago.

22:54.623 --> 22:57.467
That grail can make him king.

22:57.625 --> 23:02.132
Your project, your dream,
that's his holy grail.

23:02.338 --> 23:03.939
He's skimmed millions
from here and there

23:04.008 --> 23:05.384
and gave it to the mayor.

23:05.550 --> 23:08.304
The mayor took a slice
and gave it to me.

23:08.470 --> 23:12.394
I took my cut, and it went down
through half a dozen middle people,

23:12.557 --> 23:16.563
and you got what was left
for your great quest.

23:17.770 --> 23:20.398
Am I getting through to you, cowboy?

23:20.566 --> 23:21.488
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

23:21.650 --> 23:24.778
<i>Election's coming up
in six months.</i>

23:24.944 --> 23:28.825
<i>With product of your research,
he'll take public credit,</i>

23:28.990 --> 23:32.494
<i>and he'll use it to catapult himself
into the White House.</i>

23:33.244 --> 23:38.046
<i>So, Doctor,
I'm not asking for product.</i>

23:38.208 --> 23:41.837
<i>I'm delivering the command.
60 days.</i>

23:42.003 --> 23:43.846
And if there isn't
product by then?

23:44.006 --> 23:47.931
Then the mayor, myself,
six other high political figures,

23:48.093 --> 23:51.722
and, oh, yeah, yourself as well,

23:51.888 --> 23:53.731
all go to the state penitentiary

23:53.891 --> 23:56.940
for misappropriation
of state and federal funds.

23:57.102 --> 23:58.854
And your holy grail,

23:59.020 --> 24:01.022
well, that gets turned
into a public urinal,

24:01.190 --> 24:03.488
with your name printed
on a target at the bottom.

24:03.651 --> 24:06.700
<i>It</i>... <i>it isn't ready.</i>

24:06.862 --> 24:09.990
Four years from now,
maybe the prototype.

24:10.156 --> 24:13.376
- Any sooner...
<i>- You work for me, Coldyron.</i>

24:13.535 --> 24:15.502
<i>And you get it done.</i>

24:15.663 --> 24:18.415
That's about as far
as you're gonna stick it, Earl.

24:18.582 --> 24:21.756
You may be so crooked
you got to screw your head on.

24:21.919 --> 24:23.045
<i>But you're not pulling my strings.</i>

24:23.211 --> 24:26.631
No, Coldyron, I'm pulling your plug.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.634
You're off the project
as of right now.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.973
<i>Let me tell you something, Mister.</i>

24:31.135 --> 24:32.887
You fire me,
and I'll make more noise

24:33.055 --> 24:36.901
than two skeletons making love
in a tin coffin, brother.

24:36.902 --> 24:38.934
<i>You bastard!</i>

24:38.935 --> 24:42.236
Yeah, by accident of birth, Earl.

24:42.439 --> 24:44.907
But you, you're a self-made man.

24:45.067 --> 24:48.822
I quit. You run the project yourself,
and good luck.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.580
<i>Who's your second-in-command?</i>

24:50.739 --> 24:52.286
Doctor Houghtaling, my assistant.

24:52.490 --> 24:53.287
<i>Give him the keys,</i>

24:53.491 --> 24:55.836
<i>and don't let the door hit you
in the ass on your way out.</i>

25:05.003 --> 25:06.346
<i>Phew, phew, ham'.!</i>

25:06.547 --> 25:08.173
Oh, uh, hey, Captain Coldyron, sir.

25:08.339 --> 25:11.013
I need to get you down
to the arrange and qualify.

25:11.175 --> 25:12.301
It's that time again.

25:12.510 --> 25:13.603
What's that, Statum?

25:13.761 --> 25:15.481
You want me to go out
and shoot targets now?

25:15.638 --> 25:17.892
After the range, you're getting
in my face about this, Statum?

25:18.057 --> 25:20.026
Right now, is that what you want?
Huh?

25:20.027 --> 25:21.270
No, forget it.

25:21.478 --> 25:24.067
I'll just write it in, sir.
No need to bother.

25:24.068 --> 25:27.364
Uh, I'll just send over
another sharpshooter medal.

25:27.567 --> 25:29.319
That's all, sir.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.655
Sorry, sir. Thanks!

25:31.821 --> 25:33.619
Sorry.

25:36.826 --> 25:39.171
- What's up, sir?
- I got to get out of here.

25:39.328 --> 25:41.548
Buglar just jumped down my throat.

25:41.707 --> 25:45.086
- Why, sir?
- Because he can!

25:45.794 --> 25:47.136
Sir, what are you doing?

25:47.296 --> 25:49.765
I'm giving you the keys.

25:49.923 --> 25:51.798
Keys to what, sir?

25:51.799 --> 25:55.349
The holy grail, Houghtaling.

26:00.017 --> 26:03.145
Ahem, uh, priority line,
Houghtaling.

26:03.311 --> 26:08.159
Uh, it's the division commander,
and it's for you.

26:10.943 --> 26:13.116
<i>Oh, boy-</i>

26:23.539 --> 26:25.587
Baroney's Investments, Miss Gayle.
May I help you?

26:25.750 --> 26:28.424
<i>- Penny, it's</i> me.
- Hi, you.

26:28.628 --> 26:29.881
<i>Yeah, hi.</i>

26:30.047 --> 26:32.366
Oh, no, don't even talk to me
unless you've had a nice day.

26:32.465 --> 26:35.265
- Take <i>off work.</i>
- Give me a reason.

26:35.426 --> 26:38.020
<i>I quit.</i>

26:38.180 --> 26:42.059
Meet you in 20 minutes,
at Crocketts.

26:42.226 --> 26:44.694
Judy, I'm out to lunch.

26:52.778 --> 26:58.375
So, um, what did
Division Commander Buglar say?

26:58.575 --> 27:00.576
Coldyron's fired.

27:01.411 --> 27:04.255
I'm Project Chief now.
Uh-huh.

27:04.413 --> 27:06.541
I got 60 days.

27:06.708 --> 27:08.801
60 days to what?

27:08.961 --> 27:10.837
Well, to deliver product.

27:11.003 --> 27:14.258
That's... that's impossible.
It can't be done!

27:14.423 --> 27:17.428
Well, what if...
What if you don't deliver?

27:17.635 --> 27:20.058
Then, you're Project Chief.

27:20.221 --> 27:22.566
Oh.

27:22.723 --> 27:25.853
You, uh...
You gonna finish those fries?

29:11.708 --> 29:13.836
Houghtaling, it's not that one.
It's the index file.

29:14.001 --> 29:16.096
Would you shut up, will you?
Just shut up.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.428
Hold it, all right?

29:18.589 --> 29:22.265
Now, I can't run
a sequential circuitry test

29:22.426 --> 29:25.852
without the impulse feed chain.

29:26.013 --> 29:28.436
Coldyron, this is your monster.

29:28.599 --> 29:31.022
We'll never figure this out.

29:32.270 --> 29:34.317
- Wait, Willard.
- Huh.

29:34.317 --> 29:35.906
Punch in all the impulse codes.

29:36.066 --> 29:37.361
That'll activate the chain,

29:37.362 --> 29:40.157
and we can go down to the tank
and trace the circuits by hand.

29:40.319 --> 29:41.572
- What do you say?
- Yeah, cool.

29:41.779 --> 29:43.781
Well, uh, I guess, you know,

29:43.949 --> 29:45.872
as long as there's no current
in the chain, it's okay,

29:46.034 --> 29:49.163
but we got to keep this room locked
until we get back.

29:49.328 --> 29:51.457
I mean, my God,
if somebody just...

29:51.623 --> 29:52.714
Never mind that.

29:52.874 --> 29:55.798
What do you think this is,
some low-budget Sci-Fi flick?

29:55.961 --> 29:58.931
I mean, what can possibly happen,
Willard?

29:59.088 --> 30:00.848
Well, uh, you know,
for one thing...

30:00.923 --> 30:05.224
I said, never mind that.
That's negative thinking.

30:05.386 --> 30:07.765
Think positive.

30:07.931 --> 30:12.936
Yeah, well, I think we're
positively crazy for even trying this.

30:13.103 --> 30:15.401
<i>Oâ€œ: Keepers!</i>

30:15.564 --> 30:17.191
Alan? Alan?

30:17.356 --> 30:18.825
All we have to do
is crank it up for the media.

30:18.983 --> 30:22.203
I mean, let it spin across the room
for the cameras.

30:22.362 --> 30:24.204
We've got 60 days.

30:24.364 --> 30:28.460
And we've assisted Coldyron
a dozen times.

30:28.617 --> 30:32.963
I just knew it.
I'm gonna end up Project Chief.

30:50.182 --> 30:53.777
Say, baby, slide me them seven digits.

30:56.104 --> 30:57.195
The phone number, Momma.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.904
You've got to give up
the phone number.

31:01.984 --> 31:05.830
Hey, baby, look,
I got my bad self up in your face,

31:05.989 --> 31:08.083
and you're looking
everywhere but here.

31:08.240 --> 31:12.496
You think you're bad or something?
Another white supremacist?

31:20.002 --> 31:22.221
Shoeboogie, you're, like,
going too far.

31:23.256 --> 31:26.601
Another pale face grinding his heel
in a poor Indian's face!

31:26.759 --> 31:28.979
I thank God my sainted ancestors

31:29.136 --> 31:30.616
gone off
to the happy hunting grounds,

31:30.721 --> 31:32.269
ain't around to see this.

31:32.432 --> 31:35.527
- This racism.
- You're not an Indian.

31:35.684 --> 31:37.813
Look at these cheek bones, baby.

31:37.979 --> 31:40.606
Either I'm an Indian or I'm a sissy.

31:40.773 --> 31:44.368
And, well, since...
I must be an Indian.

31:44.528 --> 31:46.574
Don't you, like,
have some mopping to do?

31:46.575 --> 31:49.199
Yo, love,
I'll prove to you I'm Indian.

31:49.365 --> 31:51.288
Instant Indian lore.

31:51.451 --> 31:53.786
My people were red-hand Apache.

31:53.787 --> 31:56.586
We had a custom.
It's called the blood eagle.

31:56.748 --> 32:00.502
When a war chief captures an enemy
warrior that he really respects,

32:00.669 --> 32:03.763
he lets him choose the way
he wants to be executed.

32:03.963 --> 32:06.261
Oh, gross, quit it.
Go somewhere else.

32:07.174 --> 32:10.144
Yo, Betty, listen.
I learned this stuff.

32:10.303 --> 32:13.557
You see, if that warrior wanted
to prove how brave he really was,

32:13.765 --> 32:16.143
he'd ask to die
by the blood eagle.

32:16.308 --> 32:17.981
Okay, I'll ask.

32:18.144 --> 32:21.023
Gross me out,
what is the blood eagle?

32:21.189 --> 32:21.984
Check it out.

32:22.148 --> 32:23.749
Well, the warrior,
he lays on the ground,

32:23.900 --> 32:26.073
and they tie ropes to his arms
and his legs,

32:26.236 --> 32:28.910
and the other ends of the ropes
they tie to four different horses.

32:29.071 --> 32:30.592
And they slap the horses
on the behind,

32:30.656 --> 32:32.500
and they run
in four different directions.

32:32.659 --> 32:33.898
And, well, the guy, you know...

32:34.786 --> 32:36.913
That's sickening!
That's it!

32:37.079 --> 32:39.673
Okay, that's cool.

32:39.833 --> 32:46.215
'Cause, like I said, once you go red,
you never get out of bed.

32:47.132 --> 32:48.304
My tunes!

32:48.467 --> 32:50.094
<i>Guts to have my tunes.</i>

32:52.636 --> 32:53.980
Son of a bitch!

32:58.768 --> 33:00.816
Hey, what up, dude?

33:02.730 --> 33:05.904
Looks cool as blue steel to me.

33:09.445 --> 33:13.246
That was 99 cents worth of batteries
shot in the behind.

33:13.407 --> 33:16.332
Somebody owes me $3.99.

33:16.494 --> 33:21.000
Somebody in this mad doctor place
got some trouble coming from me.

33:21.165 --> 33:24.715
You don't mess around
with we the people.

33:24.877 --> 33:28.007
We the people get pissed off.

33:46.441 --> 33:48.660
How long before the steaks
are ready?

33:48.817 --> 33:51.662
Mmm, 20 minutes.

33:54.574 --> 33:58.545
Oh, I forgot I used all the charcoal
last week.

33:59.871 --> 34:05.001
I want to get out of these clothes,
and I'd hate to go back out.

34:05.167 --> 34:08.797
Oh, lady, you got some
bargaining position.

34:09.005 --> 34:11.224
I'll marinate the meat
and make the salad

34:11.382 --> 34:13.510
if you go to the mini-mart.

34:13.677 --> 34:15.771
Hm, I reckon you got a bargain.

34:15.929 --> 34:18.773
Sure, we're partners.

34:22.101 --> 34:24.561
Oh, yuck.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.657
Never a black eye around
when you got a steak.

34:26.815 --> 34:27.690
Be right back.

34:27.856 --> 34:30.451
Okay, bye'

34:33.445 --> 34:35.322
Willard.

34:36.114 --> 34:37.663
Oh, Willard.

34:37.826 --> 34:39.123
Hm, hm, what?

34:39.286 --> 34:42.164
Willard, we have an impulse feed
coming in with the chain.

34:42.329 --> 34:43.956
Where is it coming from?

34:43.956 --> 34:47.177
Where is it coming from?
Worse than that, where is it going to?

35:46.936 --> 35:47.902
Change a dollar?

35:48.103 --> 35:50.481
Get out of my face, asshole!

35:50.648 --> 35:54.949
Look, dirtwad, I'm gonna walk
back over to my car,

35:55.152 --> 35:57.952
I'm gonna call your license in
to the cops,

35:58.155 --> 36:00.625
but if you can give me change
for a dollar,

36:00.784 --> 36:03.003
that's gonna give you
about 30 extra seconds

36:03.003 --> 36:05.036
before I call you in.

36:05.038 --> 36:07.507
<i>Comprende,</i> bro?

36:53.711 --> 36:57.887
Take it easy, take it easy,
and nobody will get hurt.

36:59.175 --> 37:00.722
The car!
Where's the car?

37:02.094 --> 37:03.438
Blondie, what'd you do?

37:04.722 --> 37:06.396
Easy freezy.

37:06.557 --> 37:09.186
Okay, white boy, you get to watch...

37:09.351 --> 37:12.447
You get to watch me
blow her brains up

37:12.605 --> 37:15.449
and splatter all over the ground.

37:15.608 --> 37:16.902
Well, what are you gonna do?

37:16.903 --> 37:17.867
You gonna stop me?

37:18.027 --> 37:19.699
All you got is a newspaper.

37:20.822 --> 37:25.543
I got more than a newspaper,
and you get to guess what it is.

37:25.702 --> 37:26.827
Oh!

37:30.956 --> 37:34.632
<i>Que P350? Que...
Que paso?</i>

37:44.929 --> 37:48.307
Hey, lady, you want a job?

37:49.851 --> 37:51.023
I'm fine.

37:51.769 --> 37:53.693
Absolutely.

37:54.521 --> 37:56.523
Me too, hun.

37:56.690 --> 37:59.284
In a few minutes.

37:59.443 --> 38:00.911
I know.

38:01.070 --> 38:02.663
Sure.

38:02.822 --> 38:04.699
See you.

38:06.951 --> 38:08.577
Captain.

38:10.704 --> 38:15.302
Just fill in all the right places,
and I'll sign it for you.

38:15.460 --> 38:19.590
And since you're going into trouble...
So, why don't you go on home?

38:19.755 --> 38:21.632
Thanks a lot, Mokie.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.474
I really appreciate you
covering for me.

38:24.635 --> 38:29.893
It's been a long day.
Just doesn't want to seem to end.

38:30.974 --> 38:32.568
There you go.

38:32.726 --> 38:34.148
So, don't use that next time.

38:34.353 --> 38:35.947
Statum and his boys
don't like picking up bodies

38:36.105 --> 38:37.572
<i>with a pauper scooper.</i>

38:37.731 --> 38:40.983
I don't like it even more.
Thanks, again.

38:40.985 --> 38:42.452
No problem.

38:42.612 --> 38:44.079
So, Captain...

38:46.990 --> 38:48.992
Want you to know,
you've done the right thing.

38:49.159 --> 38:51.878
But you ain't no street cop, are you?

38:52.038 --> 38:54.836
Why don't you go back to your nice,
little laboratory and stay there?

38:56.000 --> 38:58.001
You're right, Mokie.

38:58.795 --> 39:00.717
You let us boys handle the streets.

39:00.880 --> 39:03.302
Handle the test tubes, huh?

39:04.967 --> 39:06.561
Sure.

39:09.681 --> 39:12.730
'Cause if I don't handle
the test tubes,

39:12.891 --> 39:16.567
the streets are gonna
eat you boys alive.

39:17.521 --> 39:20.492
Teeth, hair, and eyeballs.

39:23.485 --> 39:26.153
Hm, hm.

39:26.155 --> 39:30.284
I don't get it. Everything where...
Where the battery pack is...

39:30.451 --> 39:31.327
it's inoperative.

39:31.494 --> 39:32.416
Yeah, I know, all the batteries

39:32.579 --> 39:35.297
in the storage generators
and energy transmitter, they're empty.

39:35.456 --> 39:36.878
They're all drained.

39:37.041 --> 39:39.168
What's going on?

39:40.335 --> 39:41.382
You don't think...?

39:41.545 --> 39:45.891
Uh, no. Oh, no.
No, no, I don't wanna think, no.

39:46.050 --> 39:48.018
So, look.

39:50.429 --> 39:51.762
How you doing, bro?

39:51.764 --> 39:54.061
Hm, he looks okay to me.

39:54.224 --> 39:56.818
Come on, we've got
lots of work to do.

39:56.978 --> 39:59.137
One of these days,
I'm going to quit this job.

41:00.458 --> 41:04.759
Excuse me, can I get you to sign
up for the policemen's ball?

41:13.554 --> 41:15.893
Hey, what's the matter with you,
buddy?

41:15.894 --> 41:18.313
Get your pecker caught
in the plumbing this morning?

41:18.518 --> 41:20.235
I oughta jack you UP-

41:20.436 --> 41:23.735
Spit and polish, academy snot.

41:23.898 --> 41:26.025
God save us all!

42:51.693 --> 42:55.244
Willard, what do you think
drained all the energy packs

42:55.405 --> 42:56.702
down in the vault?

42:56.865 --> 42:58.539
Oh, jeez, I don't know.

42:58.701 --> 43:02.422
You know what I thought,
but, no, nothing was out of place.

43:04.248 --> 43:07.172
I might as well shut everything down
and pull the plug in the vault.

43:07.335 --> 43:11.385
We wouldn't want
some sort of accident.

43:12.465 --> 43:17.141
Yeah, I got the feeling
this is how Terminator got started.

43:50.210 --> 43:51.963
I'm going to work
after the honeymoon.

43:52.130 --> 43:53.170
That's all there is to it.

43:53.297 --> 43:54.969
What do you mean?

43:55.132 --> 43:57.842
Go to what work?

43:57.844 --> 44:00.643
All you've ever done
is go to school.

44:00.804 --> 44:02.556
And there aren't many jobs
where you can go to class,

44:02.722 --> 44:04.349
take tests, and go to frat parties.

44:04.516 --> 44:05.313
Well, what are you saying?

44:05.476 --> 44:08.355
Just 'cause I'm getting married,
my life is over before it even starts?

44:08.521 --> 44:10.230
Of course not, Sony.

44:10.231 --> 44:14.987
Hey, honey, it's just embarrassing
for a guy to have his wife work.

44:20.324 --> 44:22.952
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

44:23.119 --> 44:25.338
Better not.

44:28.123 --> 44:30.376
You know what it is?

44:31.293 --> 44:33.717
It's the wedding.

44:33.880 --> 44:35.882
- I mean, that's what's wrong with us.
- Look, I want a wedding.

44:36.047 --> 44:37.391
And just because you've already
gone through with it,

44:37.550 --> 44:38.391
doesn't mean that I've...

44:38.550 --> 44:40.052
It's a barbaric ritual!

44:40.219 --> 44:43.518
I mean, the sacrificial virgin.
It's heathen.

44:43.722 --> 44:47.101
- It's sweet.
- It's dragging us out, Sony.

44:49.103 --> 44:52.197
Look, it took three weeks
to get this shower together tonight.

44:52.199 --> 44:53.442
And look at you.

44:53.648 --> 44:57.152
You look like you got both eyes
coming out of the same hole.

45:00.572 --> 45:03.416
I'm going to work
after the honeymoon.

45:09.539 --> 45:11.838
Okay, I'll make you a deal, okay?

45:13.043 --> 45:15.922
Hey.
'Hey, what?

45:17.465 --> 45:21.139
Elope with me tonight, huh?

45:22.344 --> 45:27.818
And, uh, I'll help you get a job
after the honeymoon.

45:36.858 --> 45:38.532
Oh, it's 2:00 a.m.
I'm starving.

45:38.735 --> 45:39.862
You ate at the shower.

45:40.028 --> 45:42.373
That was five hours ago.

45:44.032 --> 45:47.753
Hey, you want to go to the IHOP?
Huh?

45:48.704 --> 45:51.126
I mean, I gotta check
the tranny anyway.

45:51.289 --> 45:54.134
You were gonna lose ten pounds
before the wedding.

45:54.293 --> 45:56.842
Five pounds, Sony. Five!

46:11.811 --> 46:13.108
Gregory, slow down.

46:17.023 --> 46:18.150
That's it, Greg Hutchins,

46:18.317 --> 46:21.445
you stop this car right now,
and you let me out.

46:25.407 --> 46:26.625
You want out?
There's out!

46:26.826 --> 46:28.385
Out of the car,
out of the relationship,

46:28.411 --> 46:30.333
as far out as you want to go!

46:47.887 --> 46:49.889
It's okay, honey.
It's a police officer.

46:50.807 --> 46:54.277
Police officer this far out of town?
Hm.

46:54.436 --> 46:55.813
Excuse me, Officer?

46:55.980 --> 46:57.606
I was just telling my girlfriend here,

46:57.815 --> 47:00.487
you guys are really cleaning up
the undesirables in this neighborhood.

47:00.487 --> 47:01.648
You crossed the force.

47:01.818 --> 47:05.119
A restricted grid
at an illegal speed.

47:05.280 --> 47:06.623
You guys are tough.

47:06.824 --> 47:10.670
In fact, uh, I'm willing to bet you,
uh, 20 bucks

47:10.869 --> 47:12.269
that you're gonna give me a ticket.

47:13.204 --> 47:15.458
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
Hey, hey!

47:16.916 --> 47:19.215
Greg!

48:37.373 --> 48:38.965
What's happening?

48:39.125 --> 48:40.172
Greg...

48:40.333 --> 48:42.427
Greg.

48:42.585 --> 48:44.963
What do they want with us?

48:48.134 --> 48:49.726
What's happening?

48:49.927 --> 48:51.769
This can't be right.

48:51.971 --> 48:55.224
There's got to be a mistake.
This can't be right.

48:55.391 --> 48:59.065
I got to talk. I got to talk.

48:59.228 --> 49:01.478
I got to talk this thing over.

50:14.177 --> 50:16.021

There's been a murder.

52:18.802 --> 52:22.306
A motorcycle patrolman
is trying to kill me next.

Hurry.

Where are you?</i>

<i>Well, this is Deputy Walter Dean,

<i>Can you identify
the motorcycle patrolman?</i>

52:40.449 --> 52:43.793
No. I mean, yes, I can.
He's a crazy cop.

52:43.952 --> 52:46.545
He killed my fiancÃ©,
and he's gonna kill me next

52:46.704 --> 52:48.628

52:53.253 --> 52:55.221
I don't know.

52:56.422 --> 52:59.768
An old gas station off I-20 west.

52:59.927 --> 53:03.648
Near exit 643,

<i>We're not allowed to move,</i>

53:15.358 --> 53:17.157
He is behind me out there.

53:17.318 --> 53:19.987
I can't stay here.
I have got to go.

53:19.987 --> 53:23.708
<i>All right, but you just tell us
which road and which direction.</i>

53:25.034 --> 53:28.414
State road 919, south.

54:30.099 --> 54:33.400
Impossible! Impossible!

55:10.139 --> 55:11.938
Duty?

55:17.313 --> 55:18.815
Oh, God.

55:30.284 --> 55:31.525
<i>Project Chief Willard.</i>

55:31.619 --> 55:33.121
Willard, Coldyron.

55:33.288 --> 55:36.166

we programmed in prime directive?

55:36.333 --> 55:39.677
<i>Uh, Doctor Coldyron,
well, uh, sir... jeez, uh...</i>

55:39.836 --> 55:41.510
<i>Well, his last orders were, uh...</i>

55:41.672 --> 55:43.072
<i>Why, is there something wrong, sir?</i>

55:43.215 --> 55:44.807
What did you do after I left?

55:44.967 --> 55:46.934
<i>Oh, well, nothing much.
We, uh... We just tried a test.</i>

55:47.094 --> 55:48.186
What happened?

55:48.387 --> 55:49.855
<i>Uh, well, I don't know, really.</i>

55:50.012 --> 55:52.186
<i>We... we followed

<i>and when we came back,</i>

55:55.936 --> 55:58.108
<i>all the power packs in the room

55:58.313 --> 55:59.280
Drained?

55:59.438 --> 56:01.157
<i>- Yeah, well, drained.</i>
- What drained them?

56:01.358 --> 56:02.985
Now, sir,
I know what you're thinking.

56:03.150 --> 56:04.911
<i>I mean, I looked closely.
It was still there.</i>

56:05.027 --> 56:08.157
You looked in the tank, but you didn't
check the suspension readout.

56:08.157 --> 56:10.500
<i>On, no, why?</i>

56:10.659 --> 56:12.001
- ROTOR'S out.
- I <i>see.</i>

56:12.159 --> 56:13.628
<i>Well, sir, I'd like to take
this opportunity</i>

56:13.786 --> 56:16.585
<i>to resign my position

56:21.795 --> 56:26.016
This is Captain Coldyron
calling Detective Mango, priority.

56:26.173 --> 56:29.768
<i>Captain Coldyron, John Mango.
I'm glad you called.</i>

56:29.927 --> 56:31.804

<i>Yes, sir. Deputy Sheriff Dean

56:34.974 --> 56:38.400
<i>A Sonia R. Garren
called from the road.</i>

56:38.561 --> 56:42.362
<i>She said a motorcycle patrolman
shot her fiancÃ© and is after her now.</i>

What'd you tell her?

56:43.608 --> 56:45.987
<i>To keep moving until DPD got to her.</i>

56:46.152 --> 56:49.373
Good. Nobody move
till you hear from me.

56:54.286 --> 56:56.539
<i>- Buglar.</i>
- Coldyron.

56:56.704 --> 56:58.503
<i>Damn it, Coldyron,
what do you want?</i>

56:58.664 --> 57:02.010
You got your wish, 59 days soon.

57:02.168 --> 57:03.715
I just hope you can handle it.

57:03.878 --> 57:05.552
<i>What are you raving about, man?</i>

57:05.552 --> 57:08.391
You wanted product,
you got product.

57:08.550 --> 57:11.052
- It's already killed once.
<i>- What?</i>

57:11.219 --> 57:13.186
<i>ROTOR.</i>

57:13.387 --> 57:16.358
The men you put in charge,
they activated it.

57:16.516 --> 57:18.483
It went out,
put itself on active duty.

57:18.643 --> 57:21.146
Its last program
was prime directive.

57:21.313 --> 57:22.655
<i>Shut up, Coldyron.</i>

57:22.813 --> 57:25.693
Prime directive
in 25-50 years from now.

57:25.858 --> 57:28.954
Prime directive to our ROTOR unit
is judge and execute.

57:29.112 --> 57:34.414
It stops felons, judges the crime,
and executes sentence.

57:34.576 --> 57:37.795
Justice served, COD.

57:37.954 --> 57:40.048
<i>Not another word!</i>

57:40.206 --> 57:41.686
You call the Senator,
and you tell him

57:41.791 --> 57:43.418
ROTOR walked through
a busload of nuns

57:43.585 --> 57:47.306
to get to a jaywalker
with malice towards no one.

57:47.505 --> 57:48.597
It won't stop.

57:49.800 --> 57:53.099
It wasn't ready.
Its brain functions are incomplete.

57:53.260 --> 57:58.849
It can't think twice, can't reason,
can't change its prime directive.

57:58.849 --> 58:02.018
It's like a chainsaw set on frappÃ©.

58:02.019 --> 58:06.742
<i>If, Coldyron, you've had one
of your experiments go out of control,</i>

58:06.900 --> 58:09.119
<i>well, I suggest you reconsider
your resignation</i>

58:09.277 --> 58:12.280
<i>and save your own ass
before the Senator finds out.</i>

58:12.489 --> 58:16.460
All right, Buglar.
I'll go get him.

58:16.617 --> 58:18.291
And when I bring him back,

58:18.452 --> 58:20.954
I'm ramming him
right down City Hall's throat.

58:20.956 --> 58:23.800
<i>ROTOR is not my problem.</i>

58:23.958 --> 58:26.211
You're right, Buglar.

58:26.378 --> 58:28.221
I'm your problem.

59:19.639 --> 59:21.231
Hi.

59:21.391 --> 59:22.643
Sorry about the TV.

59:22.809 --> 59:25.027
We got to keep it on
until after the homecoming.

59:25.186 --> 59:27.485
Can I get you some hot coffee?

59:27.646 --> 59:30.900
Hm, coffee...
Yeah, sure.

59:31.735 --> 59:34.784
- Cream and sugar with that, ma'am?
- Yeah.

59:55.132 --> 59:59.764
It's Captain Coldyron
calling Detective Mango, emergency.

01:00:00.847 --> 01:00:02.190
<i>John Mango.</i>

01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:04.726
Sonia R. Garren, where is she?

01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:08.021
I'm gonna bring her in... alone.

01:00:40.219 --> 01:00:44.065
Hey, you can't come in here
like that!

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:53.797
Hey, little lady,
what's the deal here?

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:56.929
- Out of my way!
- This guy giving you a problem?

01:01:57.088 --> 01:02:02.389
Hey, faggot city cop, you ain't got
shit around here, bud.

01:02:18.235 --> 01:02:21.284
How about a real man, asshole?

01:02:41.423 --> 01:02:44.472
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?

01:03:13.956 --> 01:03:16.880
Psst, hey, come on over here!

01:03:17.043 --> 01:03:18.135
Come on!

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:21.315
Right down there. Go through
that little trap door, right there.

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:13.023
Stay away from the glass.
Get back, he's dangerous.

01:04:17.394 --> 01:04:19.443
What's your problem, bud?

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:28.072
Get out of here.
Leave me alone!

01:04:33.661 --> 01:04:36.083
Please, help me.

01:04:36.246 --> 01:04:39.000
Come on up here.
You'll be okay.

01:04:40.168 --> 01:04:42.717
Just sit right there, honey.

01:04:44.672 --> 01:04:47.221
Hey, you! Pull that trigger,
and they're gonna be picking up

01:04:47.384 --> 01:04:49.824
little bitty pieces of blue pig shit
all over the parking lot.

01:04:51.304 --> 01:04:52.304
Son of a bitch!

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:18.481
Breaker, breaker.

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:20.893
Sonia Garren.

01:06:21.059 --> 01:06:22.402
Come in.

01:06:22.561 --> 01:06:23.813
<i>Come in, Sonia.</i>

01:06:24.021 --> 01:06:25.114
Who is this?

01:06:25.273 --> 01:06:28.572
<i>Sonia Gerran, the '86 Impulse?</i>

01:06:28.735 --> 01:06:30.112
Yeah, yeah, who is this?

01:06:30.277 --> 01:06:32.780
<i>- Are you all right, Sonia?</i>
- Yes!

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:34.706
<i>This is Captain Barrett Coldyron.</i>

01:06:34.865 --> 01:06:38.496
<i>I just pulled into the gas station
in the Isuzu Trooper.</i>

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:40.914
<i>I've been trying to find you.</i>

01:06:41.079 --> 01:06:43.958
<i>Before the motorcycle cop
caught up to you...</i>

01:06:45.501 --> 01:06:47.425
Oh, God.

01:06:47.586 --> 01:06:50.135
Eat this, you alloy son of a bitch!

01:06:57.054 --> 01:06:58.931
What's happening?
What's going on?

01:06:59.599 --> 01:07:02.478
Sonia, he's after you.

01:07:02.643 --> 01:07:07.275
I think I crippled him,
at least his ride.

01:07:08.148 --> 01:07:09.115
Listen to me.

01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:11.659
<i>The cop's name is ROTOR.</i>

01:07:11.818 --> 01:07:14.572
<i>He's gone renegade.
Keep moving.</i>

01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:17.867
<i>Don't go home. Don't stop for help.
Just keep moving.</i>

01:07:18.076 --> 01:07:19.498
<i>I'm going for help.</i>

01:07:19.661 --> 01:07:21.333
<i>I'll be gone, I don't know...
a few hours.</i>

01:07:21.496 --> 01:07:23.793
<i>Can you keep moving
until I get back?</i>

01:07:23.956 --> 01:07:26.880
<i>I have to stop him,
and you have to be the bait.</i>

01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:29.215
<i>Can you do it?</i>

01:07:29.378 --> 01:07:32.974
Yeah, maybe.

01:07:33.132 --> 01:07:34.724
<i>Help me, Sonia.</i>

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:36.806
<i>Help me help you.</i>

01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:39.764
<i>This thing, ROTOR,
is on a rampage.</i>

01:07:39.931 --> 01:07:45.476
<i>If he stays after you, he won't go off
on a killing spree. All right?</i>

01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:48.277
Wait a minute,
what are you talking about?

01:07:48.438 --> 01:07:49.648
Is that thing...

01:07:49.648 --> 01:07:52.367
Hey, what do you mean?
Answer me!

01:07:52.527 --> 01:07:55.780
Meet me.
Do you know Lake Dallas?

01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:58.829
Any of the fishing camps out there?

01:07:59.032 --> 01:08:00.512
I don't know
any of the fishing camps.

01:08:00.659 --> 01:08:02.411
I know some of the roads
up at the fishing camps.

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:05.628
<i>Good. There's a big sign
that says Cane's Fishing Lodge.</i>

01:08:05.789 --> 01:08:06.882
On the left, yeah.

01:08:07.041 --> 01:08:08.793
<i>Okay, now, listen close.</i>

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:12.715
<i>Meet me there at 4:00 p.m.
Can you do it?</i>

01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:18.261
Get this son of a bitch
away from me, Captain.

01:08:18.426 --> 01:08:19.895
Hang on, Sonia!

01:08:31.064 --> 01:08:33.067
Operator.

01:08:33.234 --> 01:08:37.658
I'd like to make a call
to Houston, Texas.

01:08:37.822 --> 01:08:39.413
Area code 713.

01:08:43.243 --> 01:08:45.246
<i>Welcome to the machine.</i>

01:08:45.412 --> 01:08:47.836
<i>Leave the name,
leave the number,</i>

01:08:47.997 --> 01:08:50.377
<i>if you know what's good for you.</i>

01:08:50.542 --> 01:08:52.761
<i>If this is Doctor Corrine Steele,</i>

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.511
<i>I'm Barrett Coldyron.</i>

01:08:54.671 --> 01:08:57.298
<i>It's 5:45 a.m.</i>

01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:59.644
<i>We've never met, but I need you.</i>

01:08:59.801 --> 01:09:02.350
<i>I'll wait at the American Airlines
ticket counter in Dallas</i>

01:09:02.511 --> 01:09:03.935
<i>until you get here.</i>

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.518
<i>ROTOR is out.</i>

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:54.198
Well, hey, Officer,

01:09:54.356 --> 01:09:57.860
there's an on/off switch
on that radio, you know?

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:30.230
Whoa! Please, don't!

01:10:30.393 --> 01:10:32.769
Oh, jeez!
Don't fail me now!

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:36.319
Woo! God, dang!

01:11:02.925 --> 01:11:05.974
<i>American Airlines
now deplaning flight 643</i>

01:11:06.136 --> 01:11:09.766
<i>from Los Angeles
at gate number 22B.</i>

01:11:15.438 --> 01:11:16.939
<i>American Airlines...</i>

01:11:47.804 --> 01:11:50.603
I'm sorry we finally got
to meet like this, Dr. Steele.

01:11:50.765 --> 01:11:52.938
I feel like old friends
meeting again.

01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:54.819
You know, we got to know
each other's papers

01:11:54.894 --> 01:11:56.567
in mathematics pretty well.

01:11:56.729 --> 01:12:00.073
Your designs for the combat chassis
are the most brilliant I've ever seen.

01:12:00.274 --> 01:12:03.025
It was nothing
without your own brain matrix.

01:12:03.027 --> 01:12:04.573
He's out there.

01:12:04.737 --> 01:12:07.707
We made him, and he's doing
what he made him for.

01:12:07.864 --> 01:12:10.458
In science, there's no room
for human error.

01:12:10.618 --> 01:12:12.461
There's no place for it in law.

01:12:12.619 --> 01:12:14.838
We built the perfect lawman.

01:12:14.997 --> 01:12:18.171
One who could walk into the streets
of blood, the cities of fire,

01:12:18.333 --> 01:12:20.506
the edge of destruction,

01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:24.765
and function perfectly,
again and again.

01:12:24.923 --> 01:12:29.350
And already, look what's happened.
Human error.

01:12:30.304 --> 01:12:32.726
Now, I've got to bring him back in.

01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:34.733
You know it's impossible, don't you?

01:12:34.734 --> 01:12:37.399
Yeah, maybe.

01:12:37.561 --> 01:12:40.314
- Except for this.
- The deactivation key?

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:41.606
Come on.

01:12:41.774 --> 01:12:45.994
Yeah, well, maybe like you said,
impossible, but...

01:12:46.153 --> 01:12:48.076
Let me ask you something, Steele.

01:12:48.077 --> 01:12:50.666
Can we bring him in?

01:12:51.449 --> 01:12:53.622
You got the key.

01:13:58.935 --> 01:14:00.686
I've done my homework already.

01:14:00.853 --> 01:14:03.948
Let me ask you something.
Can he be stopped?

01:14:04.105 --> 01:14:05.448
I don't know.

01:14:05.608 --> 01:14:08.657
When I stack 'em,
they stay stacked.

01:14:08.819 --> 01:14:11.368
Yes. Thank you for calling
Lincoln Hotel.

01:14:11.529 --> 01:14:13.050
Good morning.
Welcome to Lincoln Hotel.

01:14:13.073 --> 01:14:14.394
May I check for your reservation?

01:14:14.449 --> 01:14:17.123
Steele, C.R. Steele.

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:20.210
We're not knocking over
tin cans here. This is reality.

01:14:20.372 --> 01:14:23.592
Doctor Steele.
Yes, room 222.

01:14:23.751 --> 01:14:25.548
- Great.
- What?

01:14:25.711 --> 01:14:28.632
- That's his badge number.
- Superstitious, huh?

01:14:28.634 --> 01:14:29.677
Could I have another room?

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:32.639
There's no sense tempting reality
too darn much.

01:14:48.234 --> 01:14:50.862
Remember what I said
at ROTOR'S christening?

01:14:51.028 --> 01:14:54.497
First prototype of a future battalion.

01:14:54.657 --> 01:14:56.876
On the battlefield highways
of the future,

01:14:57.033 --> 01:14:59.957
he'll be the judge, jury,
and executioner.

01:15:00.121 --> 01:15:02.590
<i>Now I've got to wonder,
were we playing God</i>

01:15:02.747 --> 01:15:04.841
<i>breathing life
into our artificial Adam?</i>

01:15:05.001 --> 01:15:07.048
<i>Or have we lost sight of paradise?</i>

01:15:07.211 --> 01:15:08.507
<i>What was it Newton said?</i>

01:15:08.671 --> 01:15:11.345
<i>Did I request the, Maker, from my clay
to mold me man?</i>

01:15:11.548 --> 01:15:14.268
<i>Did I solicit thee from darkness
to promote me?</i>

01:15:14.467 --> 01:15:17.141
<i>Is it his fault he is what he is,
or is it ours?</i>

01:15:18.639 --> 01:15:20.891
Well, either way,
he's out there now.

01:15:21.057 --> 01:15:22.775
25 years too soon.

01:15:22.935 --> 01:15:24.481
Let's go get him.

01:15:25.104 --> 01:15:27.778
Clear the way, please!
Clear the way!

01:15:33.654 --> 01:15:36.372
We're cut off.
No backing, no backup.

01:15:36.573 --> 01:15:39.292
I don't know what's happening,
except for this.

01:15:39.493 --> 01:15:41.621
I know he's not
on an ongoing program.

01:15:41.787 --> 01:15:44.131
Something in the molecular memory
of the chassis alloy,

01:15:44.289 --> 01:15:46.582
it's affecting the brain matrix.

01:15:46.583 --> 01:15:48.837
- How so?
- He's programming himself.

01:15:49.002 --> 01:15:51.005
He's got more potential
than we ever dreamed.

01:15:51.171 --> 01:15:53.345
Oh, God. The brain matrix,

01:15:53.548 --> 01:15:55.801
it's modeled after your own
lower brain functions,

01:15:55.967 --> 01:15:58.140
without the higher functions
to control them.

01:15:58.304 --> 01:16:00.055
A brain without a heart.

01:16:00.221 --> 01:16:02.974
A conscious without recognition.

01:16:02.975 --> 01:16:04.726
A will without a soul.

01:16:04.894 --> 01:16:08.649
If I miss, you'll be fighting
your own base instincts.

01:16:08.814 --> 01:16:12.318
To combat pure will,
you'll have to use pure illogic.

01:16:12.525 --> 01:16:13.322
What do you mean?

01:16:13.527 --> 01:16:15.779
You will have to allow yourself
to fail.

01:16:15.945 --> 01:16:17.698
Use your failure against him.

01:16:17.864 --> 01:16:20.449
Your failure is his failure.

01:16:20.451 --> 01:16:23.250
Your weakness is his weakness.

01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:26.336
Then, only then,
can you do something.

01:16:26.498 --> 01:16:30.220
Great, except I don't know
what any of that means.

01:16:30.377 --> 01:16:32.720
Let's hope you never have to find out.

01:16:32.721 --> 01:16:36.559
Remember, you're the brains,
I'm just the brawn.

01:16:36.716 --> 01:16:37.842
Sure.

01:16:52.899 --> 01:16:55.528
I can pick him up now and then
on the trace monitor.

01:16:55.694 --> 01:16:57.537
Probably when he's having
power surges.

01:16:57.695 --> 01:16:59.448
He's draining constantly.

01:16:59.657 --> 01:17:00.953
I got a theory.

01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:03.791
What if I force
his substructure plates apart?

01:17:03.953 --> 01:17:06.206
If you got that close,
you could use the key.

01:17:06.372 --> 01:17:07.588
If I got that close,

01:17:07.747 --> 01:17:10.171
finding the keyhole would be
the last thing on my mind.

01:17:10.333 --> 01:17:11.586
Come on, what if?

01:17:11.752 --> 01:17:13.048
It would cause a power surge.

01:17:13.212 --> 01:17:17.011
His inner electrical current
would surge to the surface, draw off.

01:17:17.173 --> 01:17:19.141
Right there,
you'd get the full charge.

01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:21.395
What if I got that close?

01:17:21.595 --> 01:17:24.974
Could work,
but don't get that close.

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:57.065
Here's the story.

01:18:57.233 --> 01:18:59.577
The girl, Sonia Gerran,
somehow got in his way.

01:18:59.777 --> 01:19:02.371
I don't know, ran a stop sign
or something.

01:19:02.529 --> 01:19:04.247
ROTOR killed her boyfriend.

01:19:04.405 --> 01:19:05.748
She ran.

01:19:05.908 --> 01:19:08.576
The robot is programmed to chase.

01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:11.671
I caught up to her last night.
She's okay. She's resourceful.

01:19:11.829 --> 01:19:15.130
Been driving ever since,
keeping him occupied tracking her.

01:19:15.292 --> 01:19:17.886
My God, what have we done?

01:19:18.045 --> 01:19:20.172
I wish I knew.

01:19:52.371 --> 01:19:56.376
Come on, Mr. Coldyron.
I'm here, he's here.

01:19:56.542 --> 01:19:58.385
Where in the hell are you?

01:20:03.756 --> 01:20:05.304
There it is, on the screen.

01:20:05.466 --> 01:20:07.720
Power surge.
We've got him!

01:20:07.886 --> 01:20:09.136
All right, let's get off the road

01:20:09.137 --> 01:20:11.606
and go cross country from here.

01:20:18.479 --> 01:20:21.154
You don't happen to know
any good Indian trackers, do you?

01:20:24.987 --> 01:20:27.614
Used to spend every summer
on the Indian reservation.

01:20:27.615 --> 01:20:28.614
Will I do?

01:20:28.823 --> 01:20:32.670
I'm like a cemetery.
I'll take anybody.

01:20:36.832 --> 01:20:39.255
- Don't step in that.
- Okay.

01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:43.635
Shit!

01:20:49.927 --> 01:20:52.601
- Look here.
- Is it his?

01:20:52.805 --> 01:20:55.649
Well, it ain't Pee-Wee Herman's.

01:21:14.953 --> 01:21:17.456
You've been accused
of being an accomplice

01:21:17.622 --> 01:21:19.796
in a major traffic violation.

01:21:20.458 --> 01:21:23.962
Oh, God, make it a dream.

01:21:24.128 --> 01:21:26.881
I am ROTOR.

01:21:27.966 --> 01:21:31.936
You are guilty.

01:21:37.768 --> 01:21:39.395
Get away from me!

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:42.564
- Guilty.
- You're insane!

01:22:31.654 --> 01:22:33.157
All right.
Don't move, now, Sonia.

01:22:33.323 --> 01:22:35.166
We've got him, okay?

01:22:35.324 --> 01:22:37.077
I hope.

01:22:38.828 --> 01:22:39.829
<i>ROTOR'.!</i>

01:22:41.289 --> 01:22:43.384
<i>ROTOR'.!</i>

01:22:43.542 --> 01:22:45.168
This concludes the drill.

01:22:45.335 --> 01:22:47.337
That's all for today.

01:22:57.305 --> 01:22:59.307
Mm.

01:23:13.279 --> 01:23:15.408
Throw me that bag!

01:23:20.703 --> 01:23:21.704
Hurry!

01:23:21.872 --> 01:23:24.045
Buy me one more minute.

01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:30.842
Sony, help me!
Tie the primer cord off!

01:23:50.775 --> 01:23:52.698
Coldyron, watch!

01:24:04.789 --> 01:24:05.837
Sony, get in the Trooper!

01:24:05.998 --> 01:24:08.467
Get ready to back it off
and take up the slack!

01:24:17.677 --> 01:24:19.020
Come on, you monster!

01:24:19.179 --> 01:24:22.399
What's the matter,
using my brain to think with?

01:24:22.399 --> 01:24:24.189
You think I'd set you up?

01:24:25.476 --> 01:24:26.649
Enough!

01:24:26.811 --> 01:24:28.654
Do you understand?
I said, no more!

01:24:28.655 --> 01:24:30.865
Enough! No more!

01:24:36.029 --> 01:24:40.078
Come on!
Damn you, you bastard!

01:24:40.242 --> 01:24:41.413
I give up!

01:24:41.577 --> 01:24:44.046
You hear me?
I give up!

01:25:20.157 --> 01:25:23.036
The robot's electric discharge
is gonna detonate the fiber cord!

01:25:23.201 --> 01:25:25.203
For Christ sake, get down!

01:25:37.882 --> 01:25:39.305
We all got plenty of time

01:25:39.305 --> 01:25:41.929
to figure out what this means
to each one of us.

01:25:44.096 --> 01:25:46.440
I'm gonna leave my report
in my office.

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:53.073
After that, I got a ranch,
I got a horse, I got a pretty girl.

01:25:53.230 --> 01:25:56.484
And, like you, I got a future.

01:25:57.819 --> 01:26:00.072
One day at a time.

01:26:26.139 --> 01:26:30.939
