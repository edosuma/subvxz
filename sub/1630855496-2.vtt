I am the managing editor, Doug,
not your secretary.

23:38.835 --> 23:40.878
If you need me,
I'll be drinking

23:41.045 --> 23:43.172
your secret Scotch
in Joyce's office.

I've found at the back

-is a swollen uvula.
-[all laugh]

23:53.724 --> 23:55.309
Okay, these pills are
definitely making me funnier.

23:55.476 --> 23:57.061
-Can I have the other half now?
-[Shelly] No. It's 2:00 a.m.

23:57.228 --> 23:58.688
The sitter probably thinks
we're dead.

23:58.855 --> 24:00.481
Okay, so what's another hour?

24:00.648 --> 24:02.275
You've had enough, okay?

24:02.441 --> 24:05.278
Y-you can tell all your friends
tomorrow at the club

24:05.444 --> 24:08.781
about your big party
with the porn stars.

24:08.948 --> 24:11.576
That's what you think
this night is about?

24:11.742 --> 24:13.369

24:15.621 --> 24:17.832
Something is going on with you,
and I don't know what.

24:17.999 --> 24:19.542
And I-I don't quite know why,
but I just figured

24:19.709 --> 24:20.501
it would be good
for us to get away

24:20.668 --> 24:21.502
from the kids and the house

24:21.669 --> 24:22.628
and the responsibilities,

24:22.795 --> 24:23.796
try to have a little fun
together?

24:25.423 --> 24:26.799
I would like that, too,

24:26.966 --> 24:29.760
to have some fun with you.

24:30.303 --> 24:32.555
Look, I love you.

24:32.722 --> 24:34.223
And-and whatever this is,

24:34.390 --> 24:35.933
I wanna figure it out with you.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.101
Do whatever it takes.

24:39.437 --> 24:41.189
I do still have
that other half, so...

25:40.665 --> 25:42.416

this ridiculous movie

25:42.583 --> 25:43.834
into this spectacle

to give themselves a way
to do just that.
