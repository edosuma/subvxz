00:02.600 --> 00:04.720
It was like it when I got it.

00:04.760 --> 00:07.080
Oh, my days!
Look at the state of that axle.

00:07.120 --> 00:09.400
What a bodge! Oh dear.
Oh dear.

00:09.440 --> 00:12.720
My mum could have done a better job
with those wheel arches,

00:12.760 --> 00:14.240
and she's been dead 20 years!

00:14.280 --> 00:17.280
That's bad then, isn't it?
They're all warped. Look.

00:17.320 --> 00:19.600
I'm just looking for
a bit more speed is all.

00:19.640 --> 00:22.160
You race then, chief?
Planning to, planning to.

00:22.200 --> 00:25.480
Underground or in the arena?
Well, hopefully arena one day.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.400
What's underground?
Wannabe circuit.

00:27.440 --> 00:30.320
Every Saturday outside
the city wall. Oh sweet.

00:30.360 --> 00:34.520
Bunch of dickheads! Think they know
the first thing about racing.

00:34.560 --> 00:36.240
I hate dickheads.

00:36.280 --> 00:38.920
It could be several things
slowing her down, boss.

00:38.960 --> 00:42.520
The wheels, the axle, or the arches.
I'd start again with all of them.

00:42.560 --> 00:44.560
OK, how much do you reckon
this is gonna...?

00:44.600 --> 00:46.520
495 denarii.
Oh.

00:46.560 --> 00:49.120
Or, could it just be the horse?

00:49.160 --> 00:51.000
Yeah.

00:51.040 --> 00:53.280
To be fair, it could be that.

00:53.469 --> 01:08.325

01:08.360 --> 01:12.160
"Owing to the failure of your
legal representative in court."

01:12.200 --> 01:13.400
Sorry about that.

01:13.440 --> 01:16.240
"You will hereby be deported
in five days time

01:16.280 --> 01:20.160
"unless you are able to pay
a 3,000 denarii fine

01:20.200 --> 01:23.280
"or obtain a work permit
from a reputable company.

01:23.320 --> 01:26.840
"We hope you've enjoyed your stay
in Rome and please do not come back."

01:26.880 --> 01:30.200
I am so sorry. If there's anything
I can do, please just say.

01:30.240 --> 01:32.920
Can you pay 3,000 denarii?
No, to be fair, I can't do that.

01:32.960 --> 01:35.800
What about Grandma's inheritance?
That's a few thousand?

01:35.840 --> 01:38.400
It was. It's now about 50.
Right.

01:38.440 --> 01:41.520
Is there a grandpa
that could maybe help out?

01:41.560 --> 01:43.000
By help out you mean die.

01:43.040 --> 01:46.080
Grandpa will outlive us all.
Mm, great.

01:46.120 --> 01:48.840
Well, look we'll find a way
out of this, I promise.

01:50.680 --> 01:53.800
The way I see it,
things couldn't be any better.

01:53.840 --> 01:57.680
Right, how exactly? The girl
I may well love is being deported.

01:57.720 --> 01:59.720
Because I'm racing this Saturday.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.200
She bets her money on me,
I romp home,

02:02.240 --> 02:04.400
she pays off her fine, job done.

02:04.440 --> 02:06.800
Racing as in...
Chariots, baby.

02:06.840 --> 02:09.880
On the underground circuit.
Ah, and underground as in...

02:09.919 --> 02:11.760
Tunnels, probably.

02:11.800 --> 02:14.720
No, Grumio, underground
as in not that legal.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.440
Oh, perfect!
She should bet on me.

02:16.480 --> 02:18.760
My odds will be good cos I'm new.
You're shit.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.160
A bit of both.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.560
Sorry, what is this?
Carbs, for the race.

02:23.600 --> 02:26.720
I've got to carb up.
Do you? The horse is doing the work.

02:26.760 --> 02:28.800
I egg her on, don't I?
Not very well, clearly.

02:28.840 --> 02:31.720
I've never seen Peggy go quicker
than a trot. That's not true!

02:31.760 --> 02:34.040
Do not suggest gambling
to the girls, OK?

02:34.080 --> 02:36.280
I'm taking care of it.
All right, fine.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.880
G-man, is this carbs or sand?

02:42.920 --> 02:45.160
It's a sandy carbs.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.600
Keep going, champ.
All right.

02:46.640 --> 02:48.680
No pain, no gain.
Yeah.

02:48.720 --> 02:50.720
Go on, champ. Huh.

02:50.760 --> 02:53.400
She's dedicated, conscientious,

02:53.440 --> 02:56.360
she works well on her own
and as part of a team.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.480
And needs a work permit
to avoid deportation.

02:58.520 --> 02:59.920
Pretty much.

02:59.960 --> 03:02.760
Her CV seems to be a list of accents.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.240
Yes, I'm an actor mainly.
That's my acting CV.

03:05.280 --> 03:07.400
Proficient in folk dancing I see.

03:07.440 --> 03:11.400
I'm a bit rusty, but I'm happy to do
a refresher course if it helps.

03:11.440 --> 03:13.600
It doesn't,
because this is an office.

03:13.640 --> 03:16.560
Ever worked in one of these?
No, but I'm keen to learn.

03:16.600 --> 03:19.720
And she does have useful
officey skills, don't you?

03:19.760 --> 03:22.880
Yes, I can do adding and taking away
and the other one.

03:22.920 --> 03:24.560
Can you fuck people's husbands?

03:24.600 --> 03:27.920
Erm... is that an officey skill?

03:27.960 --> 03:30.320
Not really. How's that relevant?

03:30.360 --> 03:33.600
My bastard husband has just
shacked up with one of her lot.

03:33.640 --> 03:35.280
My lot?
Yes, you know?

03:35.320 --> 03:37.880
Young, blonde, perky.

03:37.920 --> 03:40.800
OK, that's not really her fault.
No, no, I know.

03:40.840 --> 03:43.680
I don't want to take it out on you
but if you stay much longer

03:43.720 --> 03:46.880
I may very well stab this pen
into your milky white neck.

03:46.920 --> 03:49.600
Right, let's maybe leave it.

03:49.640 --> 03:52.080
Thank you for the opportunity.

03:53.600 --> 03:57.160
Come on, Peggy. Yeah! Yeah.

03:57.200 --> 04:00.160
What you doing?
Just trying out a new noise. Yeah.

04:00.200 --> 04:02.280
Hah.
Go on, you bugger.

04:02.320 --> 04:04.360
Go on, get, get.
Stop. We're confusing her.

04:04.400 --> 04:05.960
Try the carrot.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.520
No, I meant on Peggy, Grumio.
Oh. Right, yeah.

04:09.560 --> 04:10.880
Hah. Hah.

04:10.920 --> 04:13.760
Salve, Grumio. Horsing about again.

04:13.800 --> 04:16.279
All right, Davus.
How do you get something to run?

04:16.320 --> 04:17.600
Maybe chase it with an axe.

04:17.640 --> 04:19.760
Usually works for me.
Sounds a bit full on.

04:19.800 --> 04:23.400
So listen, how do you fancy
a rotisserie chicken?

04:23.440 --> 04:25.360
Keep talking.

04:28.240 --> 04:32.560
So, Landlord's now living in
this exclusive gated community,

04:32.600 --> 04:35.120
slash maximum security prison.

04:35.160 --> 04:37.040
Right. I wondered where he'd been.

04:37.080 --> 04:39.680
And he wants to see you.
Why me?

04:39.720 --> 04:42.080
He values your specific talent.
What's that then?

04:42.120 --> 04:44.560
Being able to
fit through a tiny pipe.

04:44.600 --> 04:48.400
I'd do it myself but pff,
I could barely get my dick in there.

04:48.440 --> 04:51.360
Well, I want the chicken
upfront then,

04:51.400 --> 04:52.960
so I can eat it in the pipe.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.600
You know it's a sewage pipe.
Mm, OK, I'll have it after.

04:56.640 --> 04:58.360
Good stuff. Right, up and at 'em.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.080
Come on, my son.

05:05.800 --> 05:08.200
Uhh. Ergh.

05:09.440 --> 05:10.720
Yeah, push me.
That's it.

05:12.040 --> 05:13.600
Oh, it's dead brown.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.760
Close your mouth maybe.

05:17.000 --> 05:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:25.160 --> 05:26.360
Oi.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.120
Landlord.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.880
Salve, Grumio.
All right, Landlord.

05:30.920 --> 05:33.160
Am I glad to see you.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.000
I don't know. Are you?

05:35.040 --> 05:37.720
Yes, I am.
So how's prison going then?

05:37.760 --> 05:40.320
Quite secure unfortunately.

05:40.360 --> 05:42.640
I feel a bit erm, stuck.

05:42.680 --> 05:45.320
You know what I mean?
I do actually, yeah.

05:45.360 --> 05:46.560
I'd give you a tour but...

05:46.600 --> 05:49.320
I should be getting back.
It's a bit whiffy in here.

05:49.360 --> 05:54.520
Sure. Well, do me a favour
and give this to Davus, will you?

05:54.560 --> 05:56.360
It's just a little shopping list.

05:56.400 --> 05:59.360
Got ya.
Ta-ra then. Come and see me anytime.

05:59.400 --> 06:00.800
You know where I am.

06:04.680 --> 06:08.280
It's doing my head in. I just can't
get Peggy going no matter what I do.

06:08.320 --> 06:09.600
Have you tried whipping her?

06:09.640 --> 06:11.720
What, whip Peggy?
Whip her on the bum.

06:11.760 --> 06:13.920
Dig your heels in.
She'll go like the clappers.

06:15.120 --> 06:19.400
I mean, Peggy is a horse, right?
No, she's his new girlfriend.

06:19.440 --> 06:22.320
You want me to whip her on her bum.
I got confused.

06:22.360 --> 06:24.600
Dig his heels in.
I thought she was a horse.

06:24.640 --> 06:27.360
That's what you're into.
That's how you make women go?

06:27.400 --> 06:28.920
I'm not into that.
Pervert!

06:28.960 --> 06:30.200
No.
What are you into?

06:30.240 --> 06:32.760
If you're not into that...
I'm into big booties.

06:32.800 --> 06:34.960
Really, water boy.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.120
Remind me to have
the salad for lunch.

06:37.160 --> 06:40.320
Yes, don't worry.
You're perfectly safe. Water man.

06:40.360 --> 06:44.000
Good to hear.
Don't look at my tuchus again.

06:44.040 --> 06:47.800
Copier, I've decided to give
your perky little pal a job

06:47.840 --> 06:49.680
and therefore a work permit.

06:49.720 --> 06:51.520
Oh, brilliant. That's fantastic.

06:51.560 --> 06:53.520
I've overcome my anger
towards my husband

06:53.560 --> 06:55.760
due to some Celtic
breathing techniques.

06:55.800 --> 06:58.040
Those guys can really breathe.
They can indeed.

06:58.080 --> 07:01.080
In with peace. Out with pain. Whoo.

07:01.120 --> 07:04.040
The job comes with two conditions.
Go ahead.

07:04.080 --> 07:07.320
One, she must dress dowdily.
I'll cut a hole in a sack.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.760
And two, you must visit
my house tonight,

07:09.800 --> 07:12.680
gain entry and beat the living shit
out of my husband.

07:12.720 --> 07:15.800
Sorry, I don't really understand.
It's very simple.

07:15.840 --> 07:18.680
You beaty hubby, she getty jobby.

07:18.720 --> 07:21.120
Yeah, I'm not gonna beaty hubby.

07:21.160 --> 07:22.520
Then no getty jobby,

07:22.560 --> 07:26.080
because that love rat bastard
needs to bleed hard...

07:26.120 --> 07:28.160
And in with peace.

07:28.200 --> 07:31.040
And out with pain.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.200
Of course you could beaty hubby.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.880
You're nails.
Am I, though?

07:39.920 --> 07:43.200
I'm really scared of violence.
And wasps. And crowds.

07:43.240 --> 07:45.560
We have already blackmailed
Flavia's husband.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.360
We'd be adding injury to insult.

07:47.400 --> 07:50.120
We're only gonna shit him up a bit,
not kill the guy.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.200
Not sure it's worth it.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.320
All this faff for a girl
who doesn't like me.

07:55.360 --> 07:56.680
Of course she likes you.

07:56.720 --> 07:59.640
I've been hounding her since
she moved in and I've got nowhere.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.880
At least if she leaves,
Metella will go with her.

08:01.920 --> 08:03.960
Don't give up now,
hey, if she's leaving

08:04.000 --> 08:07.400
she might have sex with you because
she never has to see you again.

08:07.440 --> 08:09.280
Oh perfect. How romantic!

08:09.320 --> 08:12.880
Fuck romantic! You need to end
your sex drought, dude.

08:12.920 --> 08:15.160
End the drought!

08:16.680 --> 08:18.560
Douche me.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.040
Ooh.

08:29.440 --> 08:31.200
Hi, is Cynthia in?
No.

08:31.240 --> 08:34.000
She's gone to the gardens
before we return to Britain

08:34.039 --> 08:36.039
where we're being deported
because of you.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.120
I have said sorry.
Can I take a message?

08:38.159 --> 08:41.120
Tell Cynthia I've tried my best
but I'm not getting anywhere.

08:41.159 --> 08:42.679
I could have told you that.

08:42.720 --> 08:45.320
With the work permits.
To keep you guys in Rome.

08:45.360 --> 08:48.280
Ah-ha. So I guess that's that then.

08:48.320 --> 08:51.520
That's the last time I hear
you lamely knocking at our door.

08:51.560 --> 08:54.400
And the last time I'm disappointed
when it's you that answers.

08:54.440 --> 08:57.000
Well, it's been an absolute blast.

08:57.040 --> 09:00.480
Are you ready for this to be slammed
in your hideous face one last time?

09:00.520 --> 09:03.800
Actually... no. Not yet.

09:03.840 --> 09:06.600
You have always tried to
get between me and Cynthia.

09:06.640 --> 09:08.720
Right from the start for no reason.

09:08.760 --> 09:11.960
You are totally wrong for each other.
Surely you get that by now?

09:12.000 --> 09:13.880
Tell you what I get, mate,

09:13.920 --> 09:18.320
I get that you are a cold knob,
who's always hated me.

09:18.360 --> 09:22.440
Given we're never gonna see each
other ever again, I wanna know why.

09:28.440 --> 09:31.080
Because you're such a crap kisser.

09:31.120 --> 09:35.520
And you're a grumpy cow.
Shut up, you whiny prick.

09:37.086 --> 09:41.686
I don't know. It just happened.
And with that, the sex drought ends!

09:41.688 --> 09:42.928
I'm so proud.

09:42.968 --> 09:45.608
Thought you liked the other one.
Yeah, well so did I.

09:45.648 --> 09:47.888
I thought you hated this one.
Again, so did I.

09:47.928 --> 09:51.328
She's always so shitty with me.
Exactly, because she wants you bad.

09:51.368 --> 09:53.208
This is what I've been
saying all along.

09:53.248 --> 09:55.008
You've never said that before.

09:55.048 --> 09:57.368
Have I not?
No. You've not.

09:57.408 --> 09:58.968
I've definitely thought it.

09:59.008 --> 10:01.928
We've agreed to keep it secret.
Carry on like we hate each other.

10:01.968 --> 10:04.408
You've had plenty of practice.
Yeah.

10:04.448 --> 10:08.528
But the weird thing is,
I think I really like Metella.

10:08.568 --> 10:11.048
Of course you do.
You two are well suited.

10:11.088 --> 10:14.768
You're both brainy and... frowny.
I mean, it's perfect.

10:14.808 --> 10:18.208
Isn't she being deported?
I'm sure that bit's not ideal.

10:18.248 --> 10:20.968
Still, you've got a couple of days
of rampant humping.

10:21.008 --> 10:23.368
Then you can wipe her down
and wave her off.

10:23.408 --> 10:25.088
She can't go. Not now.

10:25.128 --> 10:27.368
I've been chasing the wrong one
this whole time.

10:27.408 --> 10:29.368
I need to keep them here.
What you gonna do?

10:29.408 --> 10:31.928
I think we've got a hubby to beaty.

10:40.208 --> 10:43.608
OK, this one's Flavia's house.
Right, here's the plan.

10:43.648 --> 10:46.288
You pin him down.
Right, pin him with my hands?

10:46.328 --> 10:47.648
Not with pins, clearly.

10:47.688 --> 10:50.448
I was thinking I could do
a berserker. What's that?

10:50.488 --> 10:53.048
You just kind of hulk out
and cause mayhem.

10:53.088 --> 10:55.568
Yeah, don't do that.
OK, I have it really as a backup.

10:55.608 --> 10:58.288
You're gonna create a diversion.
What's that then?

10:58.328 --> 11:00.888
Just make him look the other way
so I can smack him about.

11:00.928 --> 11:03.048
Nice one.
And let me do the talking.

11:03.088 --> 11:04.448
Good luck, everyone.

11:05.648 --> 11:10.248
Hello there. We work with Flavia.
We've come to pick up a folder.

11:10.288 --> 11:13.968
What, all three of you?
It's a really big folder.

11:14.008 --> 11:16.648
OK, then, come on.

11:18.808 --> 11:20.928
Hey, I know you.

11:20.968 --> 11:24.568
You're the guy who blackmailed me
for my chariot.

11:24.608 --> 11:27.528
Oh yeah. That was me.
Sorry about that.

11:27.568 --> 11:31.128
No worries.
Actually did me a bit of a favour.

11:31.168 --> 11:34.088
Went and bought a bigger one.
Oh, amazing.

11:34.128 --> 11:36.368
Yeah, that stepped it up
a bit of a gear.

11:36.408 --> 11:38.528
Leather trim, metallic paintwork,

11:38.568 --> 11:41.488
those really nasty spiky things
on the wheels for racing.

11:41.528 --> 11:43.528
Ooh nasty.
I just entered a race.

11:43.568 --> 11:46.328
Have ya? Oh rock on, man.
Bit of a speed demon, hey?

11:46.368 --> 11:47.488
Er, guys.

11:47.528 --> 11:49.968
Hardly, he can't even get
Peggy to run.

11:50.008 --> 11:52.528
She's not responding to the command?
What command?

11:52.568 --> 11:56.328
Guys, Pegasus is a highly-trained
racing animal.

11:56.368 --> 12:00.128
She's not gonna run unless you
give her the proper vocal command.

12:00.168 --> 12:02.248
And what is that?
Moooo.

12:02.288 --> 12:04.168
A moo?
Yeah.

12:04.208 --> 12:08.008
I guess she must have been a bit
freaked by cows when she was...

12:08.048 --> 12:10.368
Hey, sorry.
Can I offer you some food?

12:10.408 --> 12:12.848
Yes, please.

12:12.888 --> 12:17.008
Got this amazing Ligurian ham.
It is the business.

12:17.048 --> 12:19.288
I've got a very
feisty cheese over there.

12:19.328 --> 12:22.008
That's very kind of you, but we do
need to get that folder now.

12:22.048 --> 12:24.488
Go and get it then.
We'll have some feisty cheese.

12:24.528 --> 12:26.048
Grumio, I mean...

12:27.048 --> 12:30.048
Fucking hell! What was that?
That's for being a dirty love rat.

12:30.088 --> 12:31.728
You've just slapped me.
Yeah.

12:31.768 --> 12:34.568
I can't believe you just slapped me,
you dirty, filthy bitch.

12:34.608 --> 12:36.288
Well, believe it.
Get off me.

12:36.328 --> 12:37.968
Ooh, ahh.
Get off me.

12:38.008 --> 12:41.608
Hey, look over here. Moony.

12:42.648 --> 12:44.568
Ooh.
Get out my house.

12:44.608 --> 12:46.768
Right. Ahhh!

12:46.808 --> 12:49.288
Shitting hell. My sword.

12:49.328 --> 12:51.128
My sword.

12:53.648 --> 12:55.088
We're going.
Come on!

12:55.128 --> 12:57.088
We're leaving now.

13:01.088 --> 13:03.248
Twats.

13:05.528 --> 13:09.208
So, all in all,
I think it was a success.

13:09.248 --> 13:10.408
Really?

13:10.448 --> 13:14.368
My husband's totally unscathed
face and body suggests otherwise.

13:14.408 --> 13:16.368
But we shat him up though I bet.

13:16.408 --> 13:18.888
Not so much actually
according to Cornelius.

13:18.928 --> 13:22.048
You ate various cold meats.
That was Grumio.

13:22.088 --> 13:24.688
Then one of your bore their bottom.
Also Grumio.

13:24.728 --> 13:26.248
Whilst you took your top off.

13:26.288 --> 13:28.368
I was hulking out, doing a berserker.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.768
And then broke one of my vases.

13:30.808 --> 13:33.648
I did slap him.
Did he mention the slap?

13:33.688 --> 13:35.088
He did not.
I did slap him.

13:35.128 --> 13:36.568
He did. He slapped him good.

13:36.608 --> 13:39.808
So, can Cynthia have the job then?

13:39.848 --> 13:42.328
What do you think?

13:42.368 --> 13:45.568
We just go back to plan A,
they bet on me, I win the race,

13:45.608 --> 13:48.928
they pay the three grand, you and
Metella live snarkily ever after.

13:48.968 --> 13:50.368
That is not plan A.

13:50.408 --> 13:53.008
There's not enough letters
to give that plan a name.

13:53.048 --> 13:55.648
I know the special noise now.
Sure, you can moo at a horse.

13:55.688 --> 13:57.848
That really fills me
with confidence.

13:57.888 --> 13:59.808
What are you doing?

13:59.848 --> 14:01.968
Trust me and I will win.

14:02.008 --> 14:05.888
I don't think it works like that.
Well, at least admit I can win.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.688
OK, I admit it's mathematically
possible for you to win.

14:08.728 --> 14:10.528
Thanks, man. I appreciate it.

14:12.288 --> 14:14.048
Thanks, babe.

14:14.088 --> 14:16.368
You all right, lads?
Hey.

14:16.408 --> 14:19.128
Hi, Cynthia. Metella.

14:19.168 --> 14:21.888
Get anyone deported today,
you ugly bastard?

14:21.928 --> 14:24.168
Not yet, you ginger prick.

14:24.208 --> 14:27.048
We're selling the things we can't
take back to Britain with us.

14:27.088 --> 14:29.248
Everything must go, including us.

14:29.288 --> 14:31.568
You never know.
You might be staying.

14:31.608 --> 14:36.408
Right, Marcus?
Er, yeah. There's one last option.

14:36.448 --> 14:38.848
You could always bet on him.
Yeah, do that.

14:38.888 --> 14:40.968
Bet on him to do what?
I'm in a chariot race.

14:41.008 --> 14:43.008
That's your plan? Betting on him.

14:43.048 --> 14:44.928
He CAN do it.
And will.

14:44.968 --> 14:47.888
I know it's not what we'd want,
but it's all we've got.

14:47.928 --> 14:50.848
How about we throw caution to
the wind and just give it a go?

14:50.888 --> 14:52.688
Britain's a long way away.

14:52.728 --> 14:55.848
So, I'd much prefer
to have you next door.

14:59.448 --> 15:03.208
Delivering the shopping,
delivering the shopping,

15:03.248 --> 15:06.488
delivering the shopping to Landlord.

15:07.528 --> 15:11.488
Oh, lovely.
That will work a treat.

15:11.528 --> 15:13.168
What's all this stuff for then?

15:13.208 --> 15:15.768
Erm, I'm thinking of joining
the woodwork club.

15:15.808 --> 15:17.488
Yeah, escape the drudgery.

15:17.528 --> 15:21.648
Won't they have tools there?
No, no tools in prison. Only screws.

15:23.448 --> 15:26.768
That's for whittling.
Oh. So what you gonna make then?

15:26.808 --> 15:29.648
I don't know.
I guess maybe a swing.

15:29.688 --> 15:31.648
Oh, yeah, wicked.

15:31.688 --> 15:33.768
The years will fly by
if you're on a swing.

15:33.808 --> 15:35.768
That is the idea.

15:41.488 --> 15:43.168
Oh. Hi, Cynth.

15:43.208 --> 15:46.208
Hey, so when's this race then?
A couple of hours or so.

15:46.248 --> 15:48.408
Stylax is already there.
Geeing himself up.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.808
Right. Shouldn't he be
geeing the horse up?

15:50.848 --> 15:52.248
Yeah, he won't be told.

15:52.288 --> 15:54.968
Whatever works, because
I'm going to do the betting.

15:55.008 --> 15:57.328
You are. Wow, that's fantastic.

15:57.368 --> 15:58.968
I'd do anything to stay in Rome.

15:59.008 --> 16:01.408
I can see how much it means to you
to have us next door.

16:01.448 --> 16:05.008
It really does. God knows what
freaks might move in instead.

16:05.048 --> 16:07.448
Yeah, but it's more
than that though, isn't it?

16:07.488 --> 16:11.568
Is it? You've pursued me
since the moment I got here.

16:11.608 --> 16:16.168
Sometimes I've felt flattered and
other times I've felt mm, harassed.

16:16.208 --> 16:20.288
I guess I'm starting to see
what might have been.

16:20.328 --> 16:23.088
Only now when it's almost too late.

16:23.128 --> 16:26.848
So how about we do what you said
and throw caution to the wind?

16:27.928 --> 16:30.568
Oh. Now.

16:30.608 --> 16:32.768
This is what you want, isn't it?

16:32.808 --> 16:35.128
Yeah.

16:49.368 --> 16:50.888
Davus!

16:50.928 --> 16:53.528
Davus! I'm finished.

16:53.568 --> 16:55.688
Davus!

16:55.728 --> 16:58.888
- Make way!
- Ooh!

17:01.888 --> 17:06.688
Hi. Out there.
I'm late for a race.

17:06.728 --> 17:09.688
Salve, Grumio.
All right, Landlord, pull us out.

17:09.728 --> 17:11.328
Sorry, I'm in a bit of a rush.

17:11.367 --> 17:13.328
Ooh. Help!

17:22.728 --> 17:25.367
Oh, by jove,
he's done the double.

17:25.407 --> 17:28.968
Sex drought all year
and then boom, sex flood.

17:29.008 --> 17:31.368
I'm a dirty love rat.
Yeah, I know you are.

17:31.408 --> 17:34.208
I'm so incredibly proud.
What the hell do I do though?

17:34.248 --> 17:37.528
Will they definitely tell each other?
Pretty sure they will.

17:37.568 --> 17:40.688
Cynthia's also keeping it secret
but that won't last long.

17:40.728 --> 17:43.808
Is it out of the question that they
might be willing to share you?

17:43.848 --> 17:46.448
Share me?
They're more likely to stab me!

17:46.488 --> 17:49.888
Look, I think it's best
for all of us, but mainly me,

17:49.928 --> 17:53.928
if the girls just got
deported after all.

17:53.968 --> 17:57.248
Good thinking. Which of course
they will if you lose the race.

17:57.288 --> 18:00.368
Oh, no, no, no, no. Bad thinking.
Don't make me throw the race, dude.

18:00.408 --> 18:03.408
You don't have to. You're not gonna
win it as we both know.

18:03.448 --> 18:05.968
All I'm saying is,
if by some freak occurrence

18:06.008 --> 18:08.128
you look like you might win it,
just don't.

18:08.168 --> 18:10.608
OK, for me?

18:10.648 --> 18:13.568
Huh, fine.
Ah cool, man.

18:13.608 --> 18:16.168
May as well stop lunging then.

18:16.208 --> 18:17.768
Cheers, man.

18:19.088 --> 18:21.768
Right. Here goes.

18:24.128 --> 18:25.888
Uhhh!

18:27.528 --> 18:28.888
Ha, ha.

18:28.928 --> 18:31.208
Bloody hell.

18:37.008 --> 18:40.288
In the next race
we've got Castro at nine to four,

18:40.328 --> 18:42.968
Attibius at three to one,
and Aidanus at seven to one,

18:43.008 --> 18:45.688
and Stylax at one hundred to one.

18:56.808 --> 18:58.288
Hey.

19:00.408 --> 19:02.448
I did the betting.
Cool.

19:02.488 --> 19:04.088
On Stylax, right? To win.

19:04.128 --> 19:07.408
Yep. We'll make over 5,000 denarii
if he wins.

19:07.448 --> 19:09.608
The odds on him are brilliant,
as in terrible.

19:09.648 --> 19:12.488
Great. Well then, come on, Stylax.

19:12.528 --> 19:14.168
All right.

19:15.768 --> 19:16.888
Yeah.

19:16.928 --> 19:18.928
Nut?
Thanks.

19:18.968 --> 19:21.608
Not for me.

19:22.848 --> 19:25.808
Three, two, one!

19:36.648 --> 19:38.888
Come on, Stylax!

19:42.208 --> 19:44.528
Move it, Stylax!

19:45.408 --> 19:47.728
Oh. Ooh.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.648
Uh-oh!

19:51.528 --> 19:54.688
Mooo!
No. No. Grumio.

19:54.728 --> 19:57.088
No, Grumio.
Moooo!

19:59.168 --> 20:00.648
Go on, Stylax.

20:01.488 --> 20:02.688
Yes.

20:02.728 --> 20:04.688
Whoa, Peggy. Whoa, Peggy.

20:05.688 --> 20:07.208
Yeah, I can't...

20:08.128 --> 20:11.168
Whoa. Whoa!

20:11.208 --> 20:14.168
Moo!
Stop mooing!

20:15.408 --> 20:17.608
Ah, jove.

20:18.728 --> 20:20.408
Final lap.

20:20.448 --> 20:23.768
Come on!
Come on, Stylax!

20:23.808 --> 20:25.888
Whoa!

20:26.928 --> 20:28.208
Jove!

20:28.248 --> 20:32.408
I don't like it.
I don't like it. Ooh.

20:32.448 --> 20:35.528
Keep on going.
Go on, Stylax!

20:35.568 --> 20:38.328
He's going to do it.
Oh. Great.

20:38.368 --> 20:40.888
He's doing it.

20:45.528 --> 20:49.088
Did it first.

20:53.008 --> 20:55.488
Uhh!

21:00.648 --> 21:02.248
Erm...

21:02.288 --> 21:04.088
The winner is Stylax!

21:04.128 --> 21:06.488
Uhh! Uhh!

21:06.528 --> 21:09.488
Don't like it. Uhh.

21:09.528 --> 21:12.408
You were right about the girls.
They're not gonna share you.

21:12.448 --> 21:14.408
Uh-huh.
You were right about the race.

21:14.448 --> 21:16.448
It is the horse, not the driver.
Uh-huh.

21:16.488 --> 21:20.288
Which makes it a stupid bloody sport.
I mean, it's way too fast.

21:20.328 --> 21:22.408
Especially when someone
starts mooing.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.728
How were I supposed to know
you needed him to lose

21:24.768 --> 21:27.688
cos you wanted the girls kicked out
cos you'd done the other one

21:27.728 --> 21:30.288
as well as the other one,
I can't keep up these days.

21:30.328 --> 21:33.008
Yeah, neither can I.

21:33.048 --> 21:36.888
Hey, how come you leaving?
I thought you'd won enough to stay.

21:36.928 --> 21:39.848
We're staying in Rome, we're just
getting out of this shit pit.

21:39.888 --> 21:43.808
We don't want to live next door to a
big-nosed, lying, cheating, bastard

21:43.848 --> 21:46.568
who makes this face
when this orgasms.

21:46.608 --> 21:49.928
I don't do that face.
You do actually.

21:49.968 --> 21:53.568
That's it then.
There goes the love of my life.

21:53.608 --> 21:55.008
Which one?

21:55.048 --> 21:59.568
Mm, yeah, not sure.
I've really fucked it up this time.

21:59.608 --> 22:02.848
Oh bullshit, man. You're my hero.

22:02.888 --> 22:06.568
You've had sex with
two girls in one week.

22:06.608 --> 22:08.368
You live in the best
city in the world

22:08.408 --> 22:10.888
and you get to hang out
with me and G-man.

22:10.928 --> 22:13.528
Things couldn't be any better. Hey.

22:13.568 --> 22:17.168
Yeah, before we hug, can we maybe
wash off the blood, shit and vom?

22:17.208 --> 22:18.688
Oh. Yeah, sure.

22:18.728 --> 22:20.648
