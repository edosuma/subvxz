( Exhales )

00:19.645 --> 00:22.481
Okay, okay, okay.

00:22.482 --> 00:24.523
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.

00:24.524 --> 00:26.526
- ( Exhales )
- Ahem.

00:27.527 --> 00:30.529
First time taking the test?

00:30.530 --> 00:33.533
Uh...

00:34.952 --> 00:37.536
Excellent stop, young man.

00:37.537 --> 00:40.540
Though you might want
to pull up a little.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.546
( Car alarm blares )

00:47.547 --> 00:50.092
We can just go, right?

00:50.093 --> 00:52.552
That's my car.

00:55.555 --> 00:59.558
Easy now. You should be at least
one full car length behind...

00:59.559 --> 01:01.560
( brakes screech )

01:01.561 --> 01:03.563
It could've been worse.

01:05.565 --> 01:06.566
And now it's worse.

01:08.568 --> 01:11.571
( Siren wailing )

01:14.574 --> 01:16.575
So emergency vehicles
have the right of way,

01:16.576 --> 01:19.413
but it's not right
to turn right when

01:19.414 --> 01:21.581
it's no right on red. Right?

01:23.583 --> 01:25.585
I'm only here to observe.

01:30.590 --> 01:33.593
( Wordless groaning )

01:38.308 --> 01:39.598
Relax.

01:39.599 --> 01:43.563
You're gonna do just fine.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.612
See? Fine.

01:53.613 --> 01:55.158
Thank you.

01:56.742 --> 01:59.619
Squirrel! Squirrel!

02:08.627 --> 02:10.630
Points for not killin' it?

02:15.635 --> 02:18.638
( Horn blares )

02:19.639 --> 02:22.476
Was I a terrible person
in a past life?

02:22.477 --> 02:24.643
The past five lives?

02:24.644 --> 02:26.645
Would you snap out of it?

02:26.646 --> 02:28.773
It's gonna be a wonderful day.

02:28.774 --> 02:30.649
Who fails anything five times?

02:30.650 --> 02:33.652
I failed to ride the El
Diablo coaster five times,

02:33.653 --> 02:36.655
'cause I'm still shorter than the
"you must be this tall" hand.

02:36.656 --> 02:39.493
Does that stop me from hanging
upside down every morning?

02:39.494 --> 02:41.660
Mm-mm. I've grown
a twelfth of an inch.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.205
And change.

02:43.206 --> 02:44.663
( Snorting laughter )

02:44.664 --> 02:46.666
Hey! That's one.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.669
You don't get two.

02:52.090 --> 02:53.673
Okay. All right.

02:54.674 --> 02:56.675
That license was
the key to everything.

02:56.676 --> 02:57.676
It's the age-old equation.

02:57.677 --> 03:00.679
License plus girls
suddenly noticing you,

03:00.680 --> 03:02.681
multiplied by
ultra-hip parties,

03:02.682 --> 03:04.683
divided by
a sensible new haircut,

03:04.684 --> 03:07.686
equals popularity to
the power of infinity.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.688
The ultimate cool-gorithm.

03:09.689 --> 03:11.983
But that dream is dead
now, Russell.

03:11.984 --> 03:14.693
They're gonna call me
"Five-Time Failure,"

03:14.694 --> 03:16.695
which as far as nicknames go,
doesn't have that much teeth,

03:16.696 --> 03:18.115
but it still hurts.

03:18.116 --> 03:20.699
I'd take that over Smallest
Kid In the World any day.

03:20.700 --> 03:24.413
And at least we're still a notch
above Space Helmet and Booger Tom.

03:24.414 --> 03:27.706
You wanna come over
after school?

03:27.707 --> 03:29.709
My mom makes homemade coleslaw.

03:31.837 --> 03:34.673
Just him thinking that
we'd accept that invitation

03:34.674 --> 03:37.551
- shows how close we are to rock bottom.
- Duly noted.

03:37.552 --> 03:40.679
Well, on the plus side, at least
we do have chem lab today.

03:40.680 --> 03:43.722
I feel like that's really more of
a plus for you than it is for me.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.724
What can I say?

03:45.725 --> 03:46.852
I love science.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.737
Wow. Just wow.

03:58.738 --> 04:01.033
The way you handle that beaker.

04:01.034 --> 04:02.741
You remind me of
a young Marie Curie.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.161
Didn't she die of
radiation poisoning?

04:04.162 --> 04:05.746
I'm pretty sure I said young.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.748
Oh, thank you for saving
my butt, Mark.

04:09.749 --> 04:11.750
I'm so lucky we became
lab partners this year.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.752
Are you kidding?
I'm the lucky one.

04:13.753 --> 04:16.755
If it wasn't for you, I'd be
stuck with Cheese Hands Tony.

04:20.178 --> 04:22.761
Ugh. This school's so harsh
with nicknames.

04:22.762 --> 04:23.888
I know.

04:23.889 --> 04:25.764
What's your nickname again?

04:25.765 --> 04:28.767
Nice Teeth Ashley.

04:28.768 --> 04:32.771
- That's brutal.
- ( Both laugh )

04:32.772 --> 04:34.774
So...

04:36.902 --> 04:39.071
What are you doing this Sunday?

04:39.072 --> 04:42.781
Sittin' around. Maybe my
house, maybe Russell's. Why?

04:42.782 --> 04:45.494
Well, Monica Delmonico's
having a pool party...

04:45.495 --> 04:46.785
Okay, all right.

04:46.786 --> 04:49.788
I think I know where
you're goin' with this, Ashley.

04:49.789 --> 04:52.791
The best dish to bring to a pool
party is cold noodle salad.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.793
Or so I have read.

04:54.794 --> 04:57.796
I was actually wondering
if you wanted to take me

04:57.797 --> 05:00.509
to the party.

05:00.510 --> 05:02.353
I mean, you just took
your license test, right?

05:04.764 --> 05:06.805
Yes. It's true.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.350
Then you can pick me up.
We'll go together.

05:08.351 --> 05:10.227
Yeah. Together.

05:10.228 --> 05:12.771
Great. See you at noon.

05:12.772 --> 05:14.773
- Oh, and bring that, uh...
- Cold noodle salad?

05:14.774 --> 05:15.940
Perfect. I'm gonna be
bringing cupcakes

05:15.941 --> 05:17.816
from my aunt's bakery.
Love Crumbs.

05:17.817 --> 05:20.779
You can totally taste the love.

05:20.780 --> 05:22.365
Bye.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.668
Did that just happen?

05:34.669 --> 05:36.670
Did the girl that
I've been crushing on

05:36.671 --> 05:38.837
since kindergarten
just ask me out?

05:38.838 --> 05:40.839
It's like you just leveled up
right in front of me.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.842
You'll sneak me in through the
back gate or doggy door, right?

05:43.843 --> 05:45.679
Yeah, dude, yeah.

05:45.680 --> 05:46.845
Just gonna drive on
over, pick her up,

05:46.846 --> 05:49.266
I'll carry you in
in my towel bag,

05:49.267 --> 05:50.142
and... what?

05:50.143 --> 05:52.269
I don't wanna say it.

05:52.270 --> 05:53.852
Oh.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.814
Pick her up.

05:55.815 --> 05:57.856
That's not possible,
because of the failures.

05:57.857 --> 06:01.403
Because of the horrible,
choking failures.

06:01.404 --> 06:04.406
- ( Hyperventilating )
- Don't spin out on me now.

06:04.407 --> 06:07.576
The worst thing we can do
is lose our focus.

06:07.577 --> 06:09.161
( Liquid splashing )

06:09.162 --> 06:11.870
Uh, I hope that's the base
and not the acid.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.872
( Sizzling sound )

06:13.873 --> 06:16.876
Nope. Dwayne, please escort me
to the eyewash station.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.879
I've checked this DMV
and that DMV.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.424
I'm not finding
any appointments.

06:22.425 --> 06:24.883
Why are there no appointments?

06:24.884 --> 06:27.886
Keep searching.
Look around you, Russell.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.723
Look where we are.

06:29.724 --> 06:31.433
Bus pick-up.

06:31.434 --> 06:33.892
Where cool comes to die.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.313
Okay, okay, okay.

06:36.314 --> 06:38.897
Today is Friday.

06:38.898 --> 06:40.442
The party is Sunday.

06:40.443 --> 06:42.444
I have to get
my license tomorrow.

06:42.445 --> 06:45.739
( Sighs ) Ashley
Pinafore is a rope

06:45.740 --> 06:48.907
that has been tossed
down to us by destiny.

06:48.908 --> 06:51.910
Climb that rope right on
up to popularity nirvana.

06:51.911 --> 06:52.912
Toss that rope
back down to you,

06:52.913 --> 06:55.040
and pull ourselves up from

06:55.041 --> 06:58.917
this horror show
to a cool new world.

06:58.918 --> 07:01.880
One with parties
and lake trips.

07:01.881 --> 07:03.922
And sparkling cider brunches.

07:03.923 --> 07:06.760
Really? That's what
cool is to you?

07:06.761 --> 07:09.928
Have you ever been to one?
They are lovely.

07:09.929 --> 07:12.931
Okay, well, either way, none of that
is happening without my license.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.644
No license, no Ashley.

07:15.645 --> 07:17.646
No Ashley, no pool party,

07:17.647 --> 07:19.938
and no pool party...

07:19.939 --> 07:22.941
Has anybody seen
my medicated lip balm?

07:22.942 --> 07:26.945
We're lookin' at
Booger Tom and Space Helmet

07:26.946 --> 07:27.946
to throw us a rope.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.493
A booger-covered rope.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.788
( Horn honks )

07:38.958 --> 07:40.959
Who am I kidding?

07:40.960 --> 07:42.961
Finding an appointment
is the least of our worries.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.673
Even if I get one,
I'm just gonna turn into

07:44.674 --> 07:46.965
a quivering mess
like the last five times.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.803
Daddy needs a sure thing!

07:49.804 --> 07:51.514
Then you're gonna
wanna see this.

07:55.975 --> 07:59.978
Ninety-two percent. 92!

07:59.979 --> 08:02.982
Can you even comprehend
what that means?

08:03.983 --> 08:06.278
Okay, this driving instructor,

08:06.279 --> 08:09.114
this beautiful Glenn Bufferton,

08:09.115 --> 08:13.535
passes over 92%
of all of his testees.

08:13.536 --> 08:16.995
Listen to these comments.

08:16.996 --> 08:20.999
"Pushover. A gimme. It's like
he wasn't even in the car."

08:21.001 --> 08:25.004
Honey, you can't shop for driving
instructors on the internet

08:25.005 --> 08:27.006
like printer cartridges.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.550
Check this out.

08:28.551 --> 08:30.010
Favorite movie:
Whatever you're watching.

08:30.011 --> 08:33.011
Political views:
Whoever you're into.

08:33.013 --> 08:36.015
Religion:
Don't wanna offend anyone.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.017
This guy clearly just
wants to be liked.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.561
It's a virtual lock.

08:39.562 --> 08:43.022
He is the Heimlich maneuver
for my choking.

08:43.023 --> 08:46.443
And all it takes is
a 51-mile drive to the DMV.

08:46.444 --> 08:48.027
Oh, yeah.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.029
Who's with me?

08:49.030 --> 08:53.032
Son, you need to take
a step back.

08:53.033 --> 08:56.035
Quite frankly, your mother
and I are worried

08:56.036 --> 08:59.038
that you may be on the verge
of a mental breakdown.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.040
I'm beggin' you.

09:01.041 --> 09:05.044
What could be more important than the hopes
and dreams of your precious baby boy?

09:05.045 --> 09:08.007
Uh, an all-day flea market,
that's what.

09:08.008 --> 09:09.048
Over ten acres of bargains.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.050
Mm-hmm. And they've
got churros.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.052
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.763
He's all booked up.

09:14.764 --> 09:17.056
It needs to be tomorrow.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.601
Now, Mark, this is
the exact opposite way

09:19.602 --> 09:21.060
of getting me
to agree with you.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.062
I know it is. I just...

09:23.063 --> 09:24.063
I don't think
that you're grasping

09:24.064 --> 09:26.065
the Ashley Pinafore of it all.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.067
Pinafore Schminafore.
Now you listen to me.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.069
You are the coolest cat
in this household.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.071
If your friends don't
know that by now,

09:32.072 --> 09:34.073
the heck with them.
It's their loss.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.201
Your mom can drive you
to the party.

09:36.202 --> 09:39.078
I'll even make my noodle salad.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.080
Oh, we can invite Ashley over
to play Crazy Eights after.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.082
Fun!

09:46.086 --> 09:48.087
( laughing )

09:48.088 --> 09:51.801
And that's why Mark
sucked his thumb till he was 12.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.104
Don't forget your nose plugs.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.400
( Shrieking )

10:12.112 --> 10:13.948
( cell phone rings )

10:18.118 --> 10:20.119
RUSSELL: <i> You okay, pal?</i>

10:20.120 --> 10:22.121
<i>I thought I heard
someone screaming.</i>

10:22.122 --> 10:24.123
- I'm fine.
- <i> Are you sure?</i>

10:24.124 --> 10:25.250
<i>'Cause it was high-pitched.</i>

10:25.251 --> 10:27.127
<i>Like a really feminine
howler monkey.</i>

10:32.132 --> 10:34.134
I'm fine.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.137
Are you?

10:38.138 --> 10:39.139
Why aren't you wearing
your night guard?

10:39.140 --> 10:41.141
I should probably come over.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.859
So you're not gonna
drive a car any time soon.

10:50.860 --> 10:52.277
So what?

10:52.278 --> 10:55.154
There are plenty of things
you can drive without a license.

10:55.155 --> 10:58.157
Bumper cars. Lawn mowers.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.284
Those tiny carts
that drive old people

10:59.285 --> 11:02.161
to their gates at the airport.

11:02.162 --> 11:05.124
I know your heart's
in the right place, Russell,

11:05.125 --> 11:07.166
but everything you're saying

11:07.167 --> 11:09.169
is making me feel way worse.

11:11.171 --> 11:14.133
You're right.
We're young, it's Saturday.

11:14.134 --> 11:16.175
Let's get an early start
on our homework.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.178
This was a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity,

11:19.179 --> 11:20.179
and I bungled it.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.182
I bungled it!

11:26.186 --> 11:28.187
So be a man.
Tell Ashley you lied.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.899
You were desperate
to be around her,

11:30.900 --> 11:32.191
so you would've said
or done anything.

11:32.192 --> 11:36.195
Sure, 'cause girls love
a desperate, lying fraidy-cat.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.489
Face it, Russell.

11:37.490 --> 11:39.198
We're stuck...

11:39.199 --> 11:42.201
with boring old regular Mark.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.203
Unwanted, unloved,

11:44.204 --> 11:47.206
and unable to pull the car
out of the driveway

11:47.207 --> 11:48.207
without parental supervision.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.208
Mark, you're scaring me.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.210
Well, that's our future.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.212
My neighbor Don can't
drive me to the DMV

11:53.213 --> 11:56.215
because of that "suspicious
mole." Hope he's okay.

11:56.216 --> 12:01.220
A cab costs $137 one way.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.223
I guess we could call
Booger Tom's mom.

12:03.224 --> 12:05.224
You think that car
has boogers in it?

12:05.225 --> 12:08.353
Their everything
has boogers in it.

12:08.354 --> 12:11.230
Unless you know
a licensed driver

12:11.231 --> 12:14.233
who's willing to ride with
us halfway across the state,

12:14.234 --> 12:17.237
no questions asked,
I just don't know.

12:22.242 --> 12:25.370
Let go of the walker, Grandpa.

12:25.371 --> 12:27.246
I'll put it in the trunk.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.248
I'm not goin' in the trunk.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.668
No one said you were, Grandpa.

12:31.669 --> 12:34.253
We love you.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.254
There.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.092
Now have some fauxgurt.

12:41.804 --> 12:44.263
He loves those
Happy Scratchers.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.265
Never wins, but he loves 'em.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.227
So are we even sure
this is legal?

12:48.228 --> 12:50.269
Issued by the state
of North Dakota in 1949,

12:50.270 --> 12:52.814
but technically, still valid.

12:52.815 --> 12:54.816
As long as you've
got your learner's permit,

12:54.817 --> 12:56.275
he's the perfect chaperone.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.819
Legal and forgetful.

12:57.820 --> 13:01.280
Plus we can use his senior
citizen discount at rest stops.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.282
I like where your head's at.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.578
You don't get bumped up
a grade for nothing.

13:10.583 --> 13:12.292
Here you go.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.839
( Loudly )
We'll be back in 30 minutes.

13:17.840 --> 13:20.299
Is that when the movie starts?

13:20.300 --> 13:22.301
Sure.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.306
We may have to stop at
the movies on the way back home.

13:33.606 --> 13:34.606
This is the one, Russell.

13:34.607 --> 13:36.441
Magic number six.

13:36.442 --> 13:38.735
I may not say it enough, buddy,

13:38.736 --> 13:41.320
but you are
a terrific sidekick.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.323
Funny. I always thought
of you as the sidekick.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.868
Hmm. I'm the one on the quest.

13:46.869 --> 13:51.330
Or are you a side quest
to my much grander quest

13:51.331 --> 13:53.332
whose true meaning
has yet to reveal itself?

13:53.333 --> 13:54.626
Sounds like something
a sidekick would say.

13:54.627 --> 13:56.335
Said the sidekick.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.755
( Cell phone beeps )

13:59.339 --> 14:00.632
It's Ashley.

14:00.633 --> 14:03.342
It's our first text.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.344
She wants to know if
I can also take.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.347
- Harper Blanc to the pool party.
- Harper Blanc.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.642
Harper Blanc who smells
like peaches Harper Blanc?

14:10.643 --> 14:12.351
That's the one.

14:12.352 --> 14:13.645
I'm texting no.

14:13.646 --> 14:15.356
No!

14:20.360 --> 14:23.780
Don't you realize, one
popular girl begets another?

14:23.781 --> 14:26.365
You're trending, Mark.
You're trending.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.367
Yeah? But if I choke this time,

14:28.368 --> 14:31.371
the only thing trending
will be my humiliation.

14:34.375 --> 14:36.375
I hate to be a nudge,

14:36.376 --> 14:38.378
but I think you just
leap-frogged us.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.383
I think you're mistaken.

14:44.384 --> 14:48.387
I really hate to invoke
the no-cutsies rule...

14:48.388 --> 14:50.389
And I'd hate to invoke
the four witnesses behind you

14:50.390 --> 14:53.392
to reach down your throat
and pull your underwear

14:53.393 --> 14:55.395
out your mouth.

14:57.815 --> 15:01.400
Say hello to the Brothers Nico.

15:01.401 --> 15:05.404
Hey, meatheads,
back off my friend.

15:05.405 --> 15:09.408
Or maybe you're not
attached to your teeth.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.410
Metaphorically.

15:11.411 --> 15:14.413
I know your teeth are physically
rooted in your gums...

15:14.414 --> 15:15.414
You know what?
You get my point.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.417
You got a big mouth, inchworm.

15:21.421 --> 15:25.424
Yeah? Well, you got
one big eyebrow.

15:25.425 --> 15:28.387
Now apologize
to my scared friend.

15:28.388 --> 15:29.428
Don't play the hero, tiny.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.141
Yeah, don't play
the hero, tiny.

15:32.142 --> 15:33.433
( Sound of whip cracking )

15:33.434 --> 15:35.977
See, even they know
you're the sidekick.

15:35.978 --> 15:40.399
Sorry. Were you the one just
standing up to the villain?

15:40.400 --> 15:42.441
Seriously?

15:42.442 --> 15:44.403
At the DMV?

15:44.404 --> 15:45.444
Let's not be those people.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.447
Don't tell me
what to do, Angela.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.575
Oh, don't tell me,
don't tell me what to do.

15:50.576 --> 15:52.451
BOY: Don't tell me,
don't tell me

15:52.452 --> 15:54.453
don't tell me what to do.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.454
Wait, what?

15:55.455 --> 15:56.577
You need to fill out a form.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.462
Whoa.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.465
Not my first rodeo.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.471
Okay, okay.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.473
Just relax.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.475
Just find your bliss.

16:16.476 --> 16:20.439
( Waves crashing,
seagulls cawing )

16:20.440 --> 16:22.481
Russell, put that down.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.484
I do not need your relaxing
Sounds of Nature app right now.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.486
You need to stay loose.

16:27.487 --> 16:30.324
We've got Mr. 92% on our side.

16:30.325 --> 16:31.783
Your streak of failure
ends today.

16:31.784 --> 16:34.203
The internet's lied before.

16:34.204 --> 16:36.495
Like remember those ancient
Chinese growth pills you ordered?

16:36.496 --> 16:39.208
They were neither ancient
nor Chinese nor pills.

16:39.209 --> 16:40.499
I grew a quarter of an inch.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.501
I know you did, buddy.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.503
The point is, how do we know

16:44.504 --> 16:46.505
this Glenn Bufferton
didn't just write

16:46.506 --> 16:48.507
all those reviews himself?

16:48.508 --> 16:49.508
How do we know he's not
too good to be true?

16:49.509 --> 16:52.804
- ( Door opens )
- ( Groans )

16:52.805 --> 16:56.515
Okay, let's get those hands
at 10 and 2.

16:56.516 --> 16:57.809
Or, you know,
whatever you want.

16:57.810 --> 17:01.520
I already get the sense
you know what you're doing.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.523
Mint?

17:23.542 --> 17:28.547
Looks like we've got
a natural on our hands.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.550
So, any fun plans
once you get your...

17:31.551 --> 17:33.552
( loud thump )

17:33.553 --> 17:36.556
Uh... please, sir. I...

17:36.557 --> 17:38.557
( stammering )
I didn't mean to...

17:38.558 --> 17:39.976
No excuses.

17:39.977 --> 17:42.521
That was clearly a pothole.

17:42.522 --> 17:44.273
I'm sorry.

17:44.274 --> 17:47.401
The city should've
fixed that by now,

17:47.402 --> 17:49.112
and I apologize
on their behalf.

17:54.409 --> 17:57.576
Well, looks like I've seen
everything I need to see.

17:57.577 --> 18:00.579
All we have left is
the formality of paperwork.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.582
Congratulations, Mark.

18:03.583 --> 18:07.130
- You've got your li...
- ( Goofy horn ringtone plays )

18:09.589 --> 18:11.590
Go for Glenn.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.718
I'm sorry that
it bothers you, honey,

18:13.719 --> 18:16.595
but that's the way
I like to answer the phone.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.596
( All chuckling )

18:17.597 --> 18:21.600
Leaving? That's
a bit of an over-reaction.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.602
Karen, calm down.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.604
Karen, please. Karen, no!

18:25.605 --> 18:27.442
Karen!

18:30.610 --> 18:32.154
Pull over up here.

18:32.155 --> 18:33.612
Sir, that's a tow-away zone.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.614
Who are you, the mayor?
Pull over!

18:35.615 --> 18:36.616
I'm not the mayor.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.582
Okay. All right.

18:43.583 --> 18:44.623
So there it is. Okay.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.626
Whoa. ( Laughs )

18:46.627 --> 18:48.627
Why is it so hot in here?

18:48.628 --> 18:51.590
If you want, I can
turn on the air con...

18:51.591 --> 18:52.632
ditioning.

18:52.633 --> 18:54.633
I can't breathe.

18:54.634 --> 18:57.636
The car is so small.
Why is the car so small?

18:57.637 --> 19:00.640
( Shivering )
It's so cold in here.

19:07.773 --> 19:10.649
Should I go get your tie?

19:10.650 --> 19:12.651
Pull out, merge into traffic,
take your first right,

19:12.652 --> 19:14.071
and your third left.

19:14.072 --> 19:15.655
Why aren't we moving?!

19:19.785 --> 19:21.660
Come on, come on,
pick up the pace.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.864
You know you can get a ticket
for going too slow, right?

19:29.669 --> 19:30.669
As soon as we cross Elm,
take a left

19:30.670 --> 19:32.671
over the first lawn you see.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.968
I don't think this is
a driving test anymore.

19:41.516 --> 19:43.682
Well done. You see how
giving it some gas

19:43.683 --> 19:44.683
helped you fly over that curb?

19:44.684 --> 19:46.229
Thank you?

19:48.688 --> 19:51.690
- Doodlebear.
- You're too late, Glenn. I'm leaving.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.693
There's no more spark.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.697
No spark.

19:57.698 --> 19:59.698
But we went to the House of
Spaghetti last night.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.700
I've seen enough
daytime television

20:01.701 --> 20:03.702
to know this isn't gonna
end well. Let's go.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.705
No way, dude.
I got this test aced.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.707
This isn't a test anymore.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.709
It's something different.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.711
Something darker.

20:12.712 --> 20:15.715
Well, excuse me if I'm not comfortable
picking out my belly button lint.

20:15.716 --> 20:18.717
Nature puts it there
for a reason.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.720
See? They're just
sortin' stuff out.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.722
We just need to let this
dust-up run its course,

20:23.723 --> 20:26.268
and we'll be back at
the DMV, license in hand.

20:26.269 --> 20:28.727
Plus this is really
none of our business.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.729
Mitch, short guy, settle
an argument for me. Come on.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.733
Now it's our business.

20:35.445 --> 20:37.154
Mitch, you've spent
enough time with me

20:37.155 --> 20:39.738
to know that
I'm a level-headed guy, right?

20:39.739 --> 20:40.865
Tell me something, Mitch.

20:40.866 --> 20:42.741
How would you feel
if your husband fell short

20:42.742 --> 20:44.286
of every expectation?

20:44.287 --> 20:45.745
Uh...

20:45.746 --> 20:47.747
My name's Mark.

20:50.876 --> 20:53.752
Wow! I didn't figure you
for a quitter, Karen.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.754
Well, you didn't have to
sleep next to a night farter

20:55.755 --> 20:59.051
for the last five years.

20:59.052 --> 21:01.760
I have trouble
digesting lactose.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.763
You know where would be a really
good place to work this out?

21:04.764 --> 21:06.308
Back at the DMV.

21:06.309 --> 21:08.310
You can't just
pick up and leave.

21:08.311 --> 21:10.769
You are my sun, my moon.

21:10.770 --> 21:11.770
My sunny moon.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.482
There must be
something I can do.

21:13.483 --> 21:15.609
Classic Glenn. Big on promises,

21:15.610 --> 21:16.775
short on follow-through.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.777
You said you'd pick up
the dry cleaning,

21:18.778 --> 21:20.779
and that was weeks ago.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.074
Well, it's a tad
out of the way.

21:22.075 --> 21:24.783
But if that settles it,
I'll pick it up today.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.785
We could get it on
the way back to the DMV.

21:26.786 --> 21:27.786
You also promised to
pick up our nephew

21:27.787 --> 21:30.207
- at karate class.
- That's today.

21:30.208 --> 21:32.792
Good-bye, Glenn.

21:34.794 --> 21:37.796
Maybe we can get a new driving
instructor on grounds of insanity.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.798
Fellas, come over here
and use your bodies

21:39.799 --> 21:41.801
to block this taxi
so she can't leave.

21:46.641 --> 21:48.933
Okay, Russell, please.

21:48.934 --> 21:52.354
Our quest stands
on the edge of a knife.

21:52.355 --> 21:54.813
If we go limp,
it'll only hurt a little.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.816
That's just bad science.

21:56.817 --> 21:59.361
Let's go before
things get worse.

21:59.362 --> 22:02.115
( Tires screeching )

22:07.370 --> 22:08.828
I give you worse.

22:10.956 --> 22:14.668
This guy failed me after
you cut me off back there.

22:14.669 --> 22:17.836
You cost me
my license, forehead.

22:17.837 --> 22:20.839
That's right, you better run.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.260
He said I have road rage.

22:23.261 --> 22:24.843
Now I'm gonna road rage

22:24.844 --> 22:27.556
all over your face.

22:27.557 --> 22:29.142
What's wrong with my forehead?

22:32.852 --> 22:35.814
I'm not going
anywhere, sunny moon.

22:35.815 --> 22:37.983
You're just gonna
have to run me over.

22:47.410 --> 22:48.868
Point Karen.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.004
Hang tight.

22:59.005 --> 23:01.880
I'll be back with
my multi-purpose hatchet

23:01.881 --> 23:04.427
whose many purposes
you'll soon discover.

23:11.309 --> 23:12.891
Ashley's overrated, right?

23:12.892 --> 23:14.894
- Let me in.
- ( Both screaming )

23:16.896 --> 23:18.024
Follow that cab.

23:24.197 --> 23:27.866
How am I doing, sir? I don't
wanna break the speed limit

23:27.867 --> 23:28.907
in front of
my driving instructor.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.619
Here's an instruction.

23:30.620 --> 23:32.911
Stop driving like
a little baby and gas it,

23:32.912 --> 23:35.333
'cause we're actually
being passed by a little baby.

23:38.878 --> 23:40.920
Still, I think
we lost Road Rage.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.925
Or he's right behind us.

23:46.926 --> 23:49.929
( Heavy metal music plays )

23:54.934 --> 23:57.062
- They're gaining!
- I can see that in my side mirror, Russell,

23:57.063 --> 23:59.648
where objects are
closer than they appear,

23:59.649 --> 24:02.776
as any seasoned driver
should know.

24:02.777 --> 24:04.486
KAREN: <i> Please leave
a message, unless you're Glenn.</i>

24:04.487 --> 24:06.945
Oh, you can turn off
your phone, Karen,

24:06.946 --> 24:09.948
but you cannot turn off my heart,
no matter how hard you try.

24:09.949 --> 24:12.786
Look, her cab is taking a right on Delgado.
Push, Mitch, push.

24:12.787 --> 24:14.953
Mitch, Mark. Either one
would look really good

24:14.954 --> 24:17.957
on a shiny new
driver's license.

24:21.504 --> 24:23.922
If this maniac
comes any closer,

24:23.923 --> 24:26.965
he'll be in the backseat,
and I'm in the backseat!

24:26.966 --> 24:28.967
Okay, you're going to
engage your left signal,

24:28.968 --> 24:30.969
- but you are going to turn right.
- What?

24:30.970 --> 24:31.971
You heard me.

24:31.972 --> 24:33.973
Oh, Mr. Bufferton, please.

24:40.815 --> 24:43.692
Is now a bad time
to request a bathroom break?

24:43.693 --> 24:44.984
BOTH: Yes!

24:46.986 --> 24:49.988
Ah, the bus terminal,
where we had our first date.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.990
And there she is, pulling up!

24:51.991 --> 24:54.411
Quick, there's a spot
right there. Park.

24:54.412 --> 24:56.288
Park like the wind.

24:56.289 --> 24:58.997
Parallel park? It's just like
my second failure.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.999
For the love of Pete,
just pull up there already.

25:01.001 --> 25:04.004
I am losing her!

25:09.009 --> 25:11.010
I did it.

25:11.011 --> 25:13.012
Give me a thumbs up.

25:13.013 --> 25:15.975
This is a moment
you'll wanna remember.

25:19.437 --> 25:21.021
I'm stuck.

25:22.022 --> 25:24.023
You have a window, too.

25:24.024 --> 25:25.026
( Horn beeps )

25:31.031 --> 25:33.032
Doodlebear!

25:33.033 --> 25:34.743
Doodlebear!

25:34.744 --> 25:37.036
Tilt your head to the left.

25:37.037 --> 25:39.039
I wanna catch
this midday light.

25:41.041 --> 25:43.002
Doodlebear, where are you?

25:43.003 --> 25:45.044
Doodlebear!

25:45.045 --> 25:47.465
Don't just stand there.
Find the man's Doodlebear.

25:50.050 --> 25:53.052
GLENN: Steubensville?

25:53.053 --> 25:55.054
Steubensville?

25:55.055 --> 25:58.058
Sweet gherkin, why?

26:02.480 --> 26:05.064
Maybe she's going
bird watching.

26:05.065 --> 26:07.359
There's some amazing
conservation land out there.

26:07.360 --> 26:11.070
Knobbler's Field,
it's a bird watcher's paradise.

26:11.071 --> 26:13.365
And the Dickcissel
is in mating season.

26:13.366 --> 26:16.075
- Karen hates birds.
- Who hates birds?

26:16.076 --> 26:18.077
Karen. And when she gets
to Steubensville

26:18.078 --> 26:21.080
to stay with her bird-hating
mother, I am finished.

26:21.081 --> 26:23.082
So back to the DMV then?

26:23.083 --> 26:25.084
What's the point?

26:25.085 --> 26:28.087
With Karen gone,
life has lost all meaning.

26:28.088 --> 26:30.089
Everything that's
important to me...

26:30.090 --> 26:34.094
corn dogs, taxidermy,
scratch and sniff stickers,

26:34.095 --> 26:39.098
the job...
I'm done with all of it.

26:39.099 --> 26:41.100
Hey, no, no. Don't say that.

26:41.101 --> 26:43.102
Think of the good times, yeah?

26:43.103 --> 26:45.104
Like remember earlier,
when you were all,

26:45.105 --> 26:47.232
- "Congratulations, Mark, you've got your li..."
- No, no.

26:47.233 --> 26:49.234
I've given out my last license.

26:49.235 --> 26:51.071
Uh...

27:03.083 --> 27:04.123
If we leave now,

27:04.124 --> 27:06.543
we can still see
that movie with my grandpa.

27:06.544 --> 27:10.129
DAD: <i> Your mom can
drive you to the party.</i>

27:10.130 --> 27:11.131
<i>( voice echoing )</i>

27:13.133 --> 27:15.135
So, Ash, you havin' fun?

27:17.138 --> 27:19.139
Marco!

27:23.686 --> 27:27.146
No!!

27:27.147 --> 27:29.148
Russell, grab
that bus schedule.

27:29.149 --> 27:31.150
How many stops between
here and Steubensville?

27:31.151 --> 27:32.444
Four.

27:32.445 --> 27:34.153
Glenn, get your face off
that woman's shoulder.

27:34.154 --> 27:35.989
You're gonna get pink eye.

27:35.990 --> 27:37.157
If I can get you to your wife

27:37.158 --> 27:39.451
before she reaches
your mother-in-law,

27:39.452 --> 27:41.160
- you think you can win her back?
- Probably not.

27:41.161 --> 27:44.163
Okay, well, do you think you
could possibly think of a way

27:44.164 --> 27:45.874
to win her back
between here and there?

27:45.875 --> 27:48.167
I suppose I could try.

27:48.168 --> 27:51.170
Great. I can't think of
a more appropriate thank-you

27:51.171 --> 27:53.172
than rewarding a generous
young boy with his license.

27:53.173 --> 27:55.467
- You know such a boy?
- Me, Glenn.

27:55.468 --> 27:58.177
- I'm talking about me.
- Oh, sure, sure.

27:58.178 --> 28:00.179
Deal.

28:00.180 --> 28:02.181
Excuse me.
I just get good grades,

28:02.182 --> 28:04.183
I'm not used to being
a step behind,

28:04.184 --> 28:05.184
but why would we possibly
wanna spend more time

28:05.185 --> 28:07.186
with this lunatic?

28:07.187 --> 28:09.481
Go with me here. We get
this boob back on his feet,

28:09.482 --> 28:12.191
and back with his wife,
and back to the DMV,

28:12.192 --> 28:13.353
then... ( cell phone buzzes )

28:16.196 --> 28:17.196
Oh!

28:17.197 --> 28:21.035
Then we'll be gettin'
texts like this

28:21.036 --> 28:23.202
all the time.

28:23.203 --> 28:25.622
<i>Moly santo.</i>

28:25.623 --> 28:27.206
<i>Moly santo</i> indeed.

28:27.207 --> 28:30.209
Unless, you know, you wanna
go eat some coleslaw

28:30.210 --> 28:32.211
with Booger Tom
and Space Helmet.

28:32.212 --> 28:35.340
No! I wanna go to sparkling cider
brunches with you and Ashley.

28:35.341 --> 28:38.217
Still not sure that's a
thing, but that's the spirit!

28:38.218 --> 28:40.219
In case you were wondering,

28:40.220 --> 28:43.222
this is what heroes do.

28:43.223 --> 28:46.226
Now... let's do this.

28:48.646 --> 28:53.233
Hey! Never mess with
the Brothers Nico.

29:06.246 --> 29:08.247
Maybe they're just
giving it a light wax.

29:08.248 --> 29:11.250
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me?!

29:11.251 --> 29:14.546
You know, I had a good excuse
for borrowing my mom's car,

29:14.547 --> 29:17.256
but not for losing it to
a pack of cave trolls.

29:17.257 --> 29:19.258
What's the point
of any of this?

29:19.259 --> 29:22.261
Okay, Glenn's car is back
at the DMV.

29:22.262 --> 29:23.972
We'd lose too much time.
That's out of play.

29:23.973 --> 29:26.266
Oh, everything's out of play.

29:28.268 --> 29:30.270
Is he gonna be a wet
blanket the whole time?

29:32.232 --> 29:34.273
Okay, Russell,
I'll use Dig For It,

29:34.274 --> 29:36.693
you use Search Doctor, and we'll
cross-reference with the smartest route.

29:36.694 --> 29:40.279
No spark. Glenn Bufferton's
got enough spark for ten men.

29:40.280 --> 29:43.282
Okay, Nico Repo's 8.3
miles away due north.

29:43.283 --> 29:46.703
Which is only four miles away
from Glenn's wife's first stop.

29:46.704 --> 29:50.289
That means this quest
is still very much alive, baby.

29:50.290 --> 29:52.291
We just need to spring
my mom's car, then...

29:52.292 --> 29:55.294
Gun it through Knobbler's Field.
We'll use it as a short cut.

29:55.295 --> 29:57.296
Little nature,
little off-roading.

29:57.297 --> 30:00.299
Okay, I am not racing my mom's
sensibly priced utility wagon

30:00.300 --> 30:02.301
across the Australian outback.

30:02.302 --> 30:04.303
Fine, but you always take
my advice in the end.

30:04.304 --> 30:07.306
I mean, if anything,
I'm a <i> sparkler.</i>

30:07.307 --> 30:10.309
Hey, you're the dumped husband
of my last fare.

30:10.310 --> 30:12.146
The one with no spark.

30:12.147 --> 30:14.313
I bent over backwards
to please that woman.

30:14.314 --> 30:17.026
Why is she riding
a bus to her mother's?

30:17.027 --> 30:18.317
Two cars in this economy?

30:18.318 --> 30:21.320
( laughs ) What am I, Jay Z.?

30:21.321 --> 30:23.322
( Guffaws ) I like you.

30:23.323 --> 30:24.323
Funny man.

30:24.324 --> 30:28.327
To laugh at, not to be though.

30:28.328 --> 30:30.289
Listen, we have no time
for this nonsense.

30:30.290 --> 30:31.873
Ooh, pull over here.

30:31.874 --> 30:33.332
What? Did you hit
your head back there, Glenn?

30:33.333 --> 30:35.334
We have to get my mom's car.

30:35.335 --> 30:37.462
You told me I need to figure
out a way to win Karen back.

30:37.463 --> 30:40.339
So I figure I should
"follow through"

30:40.340 --> 30:42.342
by picking up my nephew
at karate class.

30:50.350 --> 30:54.353
Good news. Wilson just qualified
for the all-valley tournament.

30:54.354 --> 30:57.357
Bad news. The cab just drove away
with our last shred of hope.

30:57.358 --> 30:59.901
We don't have any money. Do you?

30:59.902 --> 31:01.653
Nah. Karen canceled
my credit cards

31:01.654 --> 31:04.363
after I bought a side of
beef over the internet.

31:04.364 --> 31:08.077
Last year, this dude, he gave me
colored meatballs in my Easter basket.

31:08.078 --> 31:11.370
- Well, you owe my mom a car.
- People.

31:11.371 --> 31:13.372
Excuse me if I'm not
concerned with

31:13.373 --> 31:15.374
how your mother drives
to water aerobics every morning.

31:15.375 --> 31:18.212
- People!
- Have you ever wanted something

31:18.213 --> 31:21.380
so bad that you would
lie, cheat, and steal

31:21.381 --> 31:23.383
just to get it?

31:23.384 --> 31:26.385
People! You're not gonna
believe this.

31:26.386 --> 31:29.388
Our pit stop may actually
be a lucky break.

31:29.389 --> 31:31.390
Her bus passes
right by here on its route.

31:31.391 --> 31:32.810
In fact...

31:43.403 --> 31:45.404
Karen, I did it!

31:45.405 --> 31:49.408
I picked up Wilson.
I'm a changed man.

31:49.409 --> 31:53.413
Just look out your win... dow.

31:58.544 --> 32:01.380
Oh!

32:01.381 --> 32:03.422
Feels like my heart
just got run over by a bus.

32:03.423 --> 32:05.424
Okay, new ideas.

32:05.425 --> 32:07.386
New ideas.
Shout 'em out if you got 'em.

32:07.387 --> 32:08.427
I think I'm having
a heart attack.

32:08.428 --> 32:10.389
You're not having
a heart attack.

32:10.390 --> 32:11.973
Wait. Are you having
a heart attack?

32:11.974 --> 32:15.434
( Siren wailing )

32:15.435 --> 32:18.437
( wheezing )

32:18.438 --> 32:21.400
Yeah, he's not having
a heart attack.

32:21.401 --> 32:23.442
Probably anxiety, or gas.

32:23.443 --> 32:26.445
My money's on gas.

32:26.446 --> 32:28.448
- Then why are we going to the hospital?
- Standard procedure.

32:28.449 --> 32:31.450
What kind of insurance
do you have, Mr. Bufferton?

32:31.451 --> 32:33.452
Insurance? At today's rates?

32:33.453 --> 32:35.454
I had Karen drop that
months ago.

32:35.455 --> 32:37.457
I guess you're gonna
have to pay out of pocket.

32:50.470 --> 32:54.474
Wilson. Wilson, jump out, buddy.
Come on.

33:00.023 --> 33:03.483
( Wheezing )

33:06.486 --> 33:07.486
I think I'm having
a heart attack.

33:07.487 --> 33:10.489
Oh, just fart already!

33:10.490 --> 33:12.034
You know, running through
all those red lights

33:12.035 --> 33:14.493
in that ambulance
actually made up time,

33:14.494 --> 33:16.495
and I think the hospital
might be nearby.

33:16.496 --> 33:20.209
Search Gal, find me Nico Repo.

33:20.210 --> 33:22.501
<i>Mapping route to Beepo's Tacos.</i>

33:22.502 --> 33:25.504
Why? Why must you buy
these off-brand smart phones?

33:25.505 --> 33:27.506
Lay off Search Gal.

33:27.507 --> 33:29.634
Voice recognition technology
is an imperfect science.

33:29.635 --> 33:31.510
I could go for
some Beepo's tacos.

33:31.511 --> 33:35.514
Find me Nico Repo Depot
and Car Wash.

33:35.515 --> 33:38.517
<i>Nico Repo Depot
and Car Wash located.</i>

33:38.518 --> 33:40.519
<i>Distance: .7 miles.</i>

33:40.520 --> 33:42.521
Somebody owes Search Gal
an apology.

33:42.522 --> 33:44.524
Will do. Let's go.

33:46.526 --> 33:49.528
Did nobody hear me
about Beepo's tacos?

33:49.529 --> 33:51.531
( Groans )

34:02.377 --> 34:04.503
Guys, I cannot
stress this enough.

34:04.504 --> 34:06.671
Beepo's Tacos al pastor?

34:06.672 --> 34:08.547
Well worth the visit.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.549
Could we just please
refocus on the part

34:10.550 --> 34:12.386
where we get my mom's car back

34:12.387 --> 34:13.678
before it's stripped for parts?

34:13.679 --> 34:15.554
( All laughing )

34:15.554 --> 34:17.556
Spray 'em!

34:17.556 --> 34:20.393
Is anyone else getting the vibe

34:20.395 --> 34:22.561
that logic and reason are off
the table with this bunch?

34:22.562 --> 34:24.563
Even if we had the money,

34:24.563 --> 34:27.565
it's not like they would
just hand over the car.

34:27.567 --> 34:30.569
At least, not without us
leaving here with wet crotches.

34:30.570 --> 34:32.697
Wilson! You're trained
in physical combat.

34:32.697 --> 34:34.572
Any advice, broheim?

34:34.574 --> 34:36.576
My advice?

34:38.413 --> 34:40.579
I don't care.
I got a party to be at.

34:40.580 --> 34:43.581
Roger that, broheim.

34:43.583 --> 34:45.583
Well, it looks like
we're stuck, broheims.

34:45.585 --> 34:47.585
Stop saying broheim.

34:47.587 --> 34:50.549
Hey, Russell, could you just
knock me out and wake me up

34:50.550 --> 34:52.551
when I'm
a licensed driver, please?

34:52.552 --> 34:54.592
I say we ram their defenses

34:54.594 --> 34:57.596
at the joints
to test its integrity.

34:57.597 --> 35:01.310
Or what about that sewage
pipe you've got your foot on?

35:01.311 --> 35:03.603
Property values here
must be terrific.

35:11.611 --> 35:14.613
( Water dripping )

35:14.614 --> 35:17.159
Maybe it tunnels
underneath the fence.

35:17.160 --> 35:20.620
Unfortunately, it's too tight
for any of us to crawl through.

35:24.624 --> 35:27.045
Not for the smallest
kid in the world.

35:29.629 --> 35:31.630
For the record,
I chafed my elbow

35:31.631 --> 35:33.050
and had to suck in my gut,

35:33.051 --> 35:34.633
so, you know, not that small.

35:34.634 --> 35:36.635
You look like you could
be in my grade.

35:36.636 --> 35:38.637
For reals.

35:38.638 --> 35:40.474
You know, if you weren't eight.

35:40.475 --> 35:41.640
Dream on, short round.

35:41.641 --> 35:45.644
Whoa ho ho! Burn!

35:45.645 --> 35:48.607
Why don't you two just go
sit quietly over there.

35:48.608 --> 35:50.650
Maybe work on a speech
to win your wife back,

35:50.651 --> 35:52.652
'cause it's the point
of the whole mission.

35:56.656 --> 35:58.657
Russell, I'm really not sure
this is a good idea.

35:58.658 --> 36:01.660
Please. I'll just crawl
through mole-man style,

36:01.661 --> 36:03.662
liberate your mom's car,

36:03.663 --> 36:06.665
and we'll be rippin' across
Knobbler's Field in no time.

36:06.666 --> 36:09.668
I still haven't said
yes to that.

36:09.669 --> 36:11.671
You always take
my advice in the end.

36:20.680 --> 36:22.682
You're doin' great, Russell.

36:22.683 --> 36:26.520
And you do not have
a newly discovered fear

36:26.521 --> 36:27.980
of closed places.

36:35.695 --> 36:38.697
( Shrieks, pants )

36:38.698 --> 36:40.700
Human head.

36:46.706 --> 36:48.833
It's just a mannequin head.

36:48.834 --> 36:50.709
That's...

36:50.710 --> 36:53.005
equally as creepy.

36:53.006 --> 36:54.713
I can't see him anymore, guys.

36:54.714 --> 36:56.715
His mom makes him wear
those sneakers

36:56.716 --> 36:58.717
with the reflective patches.

36:58.718 --> 37:00.721
You know, you remind me of me
when I was young.

37:04.724 --> 37:07.726
Why? Why would you ever
say that to me?

37:07.727 --> 37:09.728
You are single-minded
in purpose,

37:09.729 --> 37:11.730
just like I was.

37:11.731 --> 37:13.858
That's how I landed Karen.

37:13.859 --> 37:15.734
And believe you me,

37:15.735 --> 37:17.737
that girl was <i> way
</i> out of my league.

37:17.738 --> 37:21.740
That's nothing like... me.

37:21.741 --> 37:24.743
Of course, I had
to sacrifice stuff to get her.

37:24.744 --> 37:26.745
She hated my dream
of going to clown college,

37:26.746 --> 37:28.747
so that went bye-bye.

37:28.748 --> 37:31.043
But these are the choices
you make for a lady

37:31.044 --> 37:33.878
who lifts you up
to a whole new level.

37:33.879 --> 37:36.048
So what if I cry
in the basement

37:36.049 --> 37:38.757
while making balloon
animals in secret?

37:38.758 --> 37:41.303
It's worth it.

37:41.304 --> 37:42.761
And it'll be
worth it for you, too.

37:42.762 --> 37:45.764
Oh, it wasn't so bad.

37:45.765 --> 37:47.767
I had a loyal friend
to talk to.

37:47.768 --> 37:50.769
Wore orthopedic shoes.

37:50.770 --> 37:52.771
I used to call him my sidekick.

37:52.772 --> 37:54.773
You know,

37:54.774 --> 37:56.068
now that I think about it,

37:56.069 --> 37:58.487
I guess it sounds
nothing like you.

37:58.488 --> 38:01.781
Yeah, Mark. Nothing like you.

38:04.784 --> 38:08.788
Russell! ( Voice echoing )

38:15.213 --> 38:18.797
Stuck? The irony.

38:18.798 --> 38:19.925
( Cell phone rings )

38:21.927 --> 38:23.802
Search Gal, answer.

38:23.803 --> 38:27.807
<i>Mapping route to Beepo's Tacos.</i>

38:36.109 --> 38:38.817
Search Gal, kill! Kill!

38:38.818 --> 38:41.820
<i>Kill command accepted.
Shutting down now.</i>

38:41.821 --> 38:45.824
( phone powers down )

38:45.825 --> 38:49.788
( whispering )
Search Gal, help me.

38:49.789 --> 38:53.832
Oh! I ate seven bags
of cotton candy that night.

38:53.833 --> 38:55.834
<i>You have reached
the voice-mail of...</i>

38:55.835 --> 38:57.837
Guys, he's not picking up.
It's really not a good sign.

38:57.838 --> 38:59.838
Russell doesn't get
that many phone calls,

38:59.839 --> 39:01.840
so he never lets them
go to voice-mail.

39:01.841 --> 39:03.842
Wait a minute.

39:03.843 --> 39:06.845
You two can afford
phone plans with "voice-mail"?

39:06.846 --> 39:09.848
( Wheezing laugh )
Who are you, Jay Z.?

39:09.849 --> 39:12.851
Listen, we don't get
my mom's car back,

39:12.852 --> 39:15.854
we can kiss both Ashley
and your wife good-bye.

39:15.855 --> 39:17.816
That's horrible. Who's Ashley?

39:17.817 --> 39:18.857
( Cell phone rings )

39:18.858 --> 39:20.859
It's Ashley.

39:20.860 --> 39:23.405
You are a conjurer
of evil things.

39:23.406 --> 39:25.574
- Hey, girl!
- <i> Quick question.</i>

39:25.575 --> 39:27.701
What's your favorite
kind of cupcake?

39:27.702 --> 39:30.869
Fair warning: Amber Valeen's
favorite is ganache,

39:30.870 --> 39:33.165
so you'll probably have
ganache all over your car.

39:33.166 --> 39:36.875
- Oh. So Amber's coming too?
- <i> Fun, right?</i>

39:36.876 --> 39:39.878
Is there anybody else
I need to get a cupcake for?

39:39.879 --> 39:41.298
Uh...

39:41.299 --> 39:46.885
Well, does Monica Delmonico's
pool have a shallow end?

39:46.886 --> 39:49.888
And if so,
specifically, how shallow?

39:49.889 --> 39:52.891
- Uh, I guess I could check.
- <i> You know what? Never mind.</i>

39:52.892 --> 39:54.893
Not to be a stick in the mud,

39:54.894 --> 39:57.189
but my mom's car
has sort of an intimate feel,

39:57.190 --> 39:59.898
and what with the expanding
passenger list...

39:59.899 --> 40:02.902
Oh, totally.
Hey, you know Dean Greeves

40:02.903 --> 40:04.903
<i>just got his license,</i>

40:04.904 --> 40:07.449
and a new SUV that has tons
of room, so we could just...

40:07.450 --> 40:10.869
Vanilla. Get me vanilla.

40:10.870 --> 40:13.913
Bye, girl.

40:15.915 --> 40:18.043
I knew it.
The sharks are circling.

40:18.044 --> 40:19.918
Stupid mole-man plan.

40:19.919 --> 40:22.756
I'm the one with
things at stake here.

40:22.757 --> 40:25.924
Russell is gonna mole-man me
out of my new life.

40:25.925 --> 40:27.761
Okay, okay.

40:27.762 --> 40:29.928
The only way to free Russell,

40:29.929 --> 40:30.929
get my mom's car back,

40:30.930 --> 40:32.931
and get back on the road
to your wife

40:32.932 --> 40:35.934
is to get on the other
side of that fence.

40:35.935 --> 40:38.897
The only question is how.

40:38.898 --> 40:41.483
All right, impromptu
brainstorming session.

40:41.484 --> 40:42.941
Shout 'em out if you got 'em.

40:42.942 --> 40:44.943
Phone delivery man! Skydiving!

40:44.944 --> 40:46.071
Delivery man! Time travel!

40:46.072 --> 40:47.656
You said delivery man
twice, Glenn.

40:47.657 --> 40:48.947
That's how much
I believe in it.

40:48.948 --> 40:50.659
Wilson.

40:50.660 --> 40:52.661
Nothin'?

40:52.662 --> 40:55.664
Lay off, bro.
I'm about to clear level three.

40:55.665 --> 40:57.916
While I agree that
video games may offer

40:57.917 --> 41:00.503
most of life's answers,
I really don't think...

41:03.963 --> 41:06.965
Wilson! You're a genius!

41:06.966 --> 41:08.802
Oh!

41:08.803 --> 41:10.969
Whoo!

41:10.970 --> 41:12.971
Didn't shower after
karate, did you, buddy?

41:12.972 --> 41:14.974
Chicks dig the musk.

41:18.938 --> 41:22.107
As you can see, I've come
to my own rescue once again.

41:22.108 --> 41:23.982
You're welcome.

41:23.983 --> 41:26.695
Once I am safely
on the other side,

41:26.696 --> 41:28.987
you two gentlemen can
scurry over by way of

41:28.988 --> 41:31.990
this crude but sturdy rope,

41:31.991 --> 41:34.119
meticulously engineered
from two undershirts,

41:34.120 --> 41:36.995
a pair of khakis,
an old trash bag,

41:36.996 --> 41:38.415
and Wilson's
yellow karate belt.

41:38.416 --> 41:40.999
Congratulations,
by the way, man.

41:41.001 --> 41:43.002
- That's really something to be proud of.
- Whatevs.

41:43.003 --> 41:45.004
- Yeah?
- Shouldn't you be wearing a helmet?

41:45.005 --> 41:48.007
( laughs ) Totally unnecessary.

41:48.008 --> 41:51.010
Taking into consideration
your height and, uh,

41:51.011 --> 41:53.305
doughy build,
your downward force

41:53.306 --> 41:55.974
should launch me into the sky,

41:55.975 --> 41:58.017
I pull my shirt taut,

41:58.018 --> 42:00.019
simulating the aerodynamics
of your average fruit bat,

42:00.020 --> 42:02.021
allowing me to sail over
the fence,

42:02.022 --> 42:06.026
and land safely on that filthy,
gross mattress right over there.

42:09.029 --> 42:11.030
Don't have to raise your hand.

42:11.031 --> 42:13.032
You, uh, take physics
in school?

42:13.033 --> 42:15.034
Nope. Chemistry.

42:15.035 --> 42:18.747
But the principles
are more or less the same.

42:18.748 --> 42:20.039
The math is sound.

42:20.040 --> 42:23.042
Sounds like genius forgot
to carry a two.

42:23.043 --> 42:25.044
Hope you like
the taste of dirt.

42:25.045 --> 42:27.046
Trust me.

42:27.047 --> 42:29.009
Jump.

42:32.052 --> 42:34.764
Abort!!

42:46.066 --> 42:48.068
( Weakly ) Ta-da.

42:54.074 --> 42:57.076
Man, I should've just
stayed in that ambulance.

42:57.077 --> 42:59.079
Wow!

42:59.080 --> 43:01.915
You must feel
so stupid right now.

43:01.916 --> 43:05.084
What does it feel like
to be that stupid?

43:05.085 --> 43:08.088
ANGELA: Move it, chumps.

43:10.508 --> 43:13.092
Come on, give
the poor kid a break.

43:13.093 --> 43:14.386
He doesn't even know
what state he's in.

43:14.387 --> 43:17.096
Why you gotta
ruin things, Angela?

43:17.097 --> 43:19.098
Yeah, why you gotta
ruin things?

43:19.099 --> 43:21.100
- Go get me a juice box.
- ( Whip cracking )

43:21.101 --> 43:23.937
Hey, don't make me
send you to bed.

43:23.938 --> 43:25.814
You knuckleheads try
and stay out of jail

43:25.815 --> 43:27.817
while I get
this sack of meat's car.

43:29.652 --> 43:33.112
I'm just gonna
lay here and clear my head.

43:33.113 --> 43:35.407
You know what's good for that?

43:35.408 --> 43:37.535
A bath.

43:45.125 --> 43:47.126
Am I done yet?

43:47.127 --> 43:50.129
Nope. I got a coupon.

43:50.130 --> 43:52.425
Buy one, get one free.

44:06.146 --> 44:07.440
That wasn't so bad.

44:27.167 --> 44:30.169
( Mimicking brothers ) "Butt out, Angela.
You ruin everything."

44:30.170 --> 44:31.171
You butt out.

44:34.009 --> 44:36.175
Don't make me have to hurt you.

44:36.176 --> 44:39.178
I don't want to,
but I will tase you.

44:39.179 --> 44:40.179
My sidekick is in peril.

44:40.180 --> 44:42.182
You're gonna tase me?

44:42.183 --> 44:44.183
With your Taser?

44:44.184 --> 44:46.896
That's what I said.

44:48.606 --> 44:51.190
You are adorable.

44:51.191 --> 44:53.193
You know what?
I'm gonna let you have this.

44:59.034 --> 45:01.200
You're too kind.

45:01.201 --> 45:04.203
You know, as much as
this industrial-strength soap

45:04.204 --> 45:06.205
really stings, it doesn't sting

45:06.206 --> 45:08.042
nearly as bad as
those five failures

45:08.043 --> 45:09.209
I was telling you
about earlier.

45:09.210 --> 45:13.505
So if anyone understands
your frustration at the world,

45:13.506 --> 45:15.214
it's me.

45:15.215 --> 45:18.217
The man is our enemy,
not each other.

45:18.218 --> 45:20.219
I beseech you.

45:20.220 --> 45:22.639
Let us part as friends, huh?

45:22.640 --> 45:25.224
The best of friends.

45:25.225 --> 45:27.227
What say you?

45:39.239 --> 45:42.242
Is that the majority opinion?

45:46.246 --> 45:48.247
Hop in, buddy.

45:48.248 --> 45:51.085
- I took a hostage.
- What?!

45:51.086 --> 45:52.251
- Get 'em.
- Stay back.

45:52.252 --> 45:54.214
The tiny one is a maniac.

45:55.255 --> 45:58.092
He is gonna tase me.

45:58.093 --> 45:59.259
With his Taser.

46:06.101 --> 46:09.268
I'm so mad, I wanna yank off
another mannequin head.

46:09.269 --> 46:11.980
You should probably
cool it with that, bro.

46:11.981 --> 46:13.272
Cool nothing.

46:13.273 --> 46:16.276
I have three words, gentlemen.

46:18.696 --> 46:21.281
Beast Mode.

46:28.288 --> 46:30.582
Wilson, where's your uncle?

46:30.583 --> 46:34.294
Uncle by marriage, dude.

46:40.843 --> 46:43.302
Sh!

46:43.303 --> 46:45.304
Be still.

46:45.305 --> 46:48.307
Russell's got you.
Let me be your hero.

46:48.308 --> 46:50.309
Hero? You are the least
heroic hero

46:50.310 --> 46:53.313
in all of hero history.

46:57.318 --> 46:59.444
( Waves crashing,
seagulls cawing )

46:59.445 --> 47:03.322
I will shove that thing
down your...

47:03.323 --> 47:06.325
So, Russell tells me
you two are best friends.

47:06.326 --> 47:10.329
Best friends don't make things
go from bad to worse.

47:10.330 --> 47:12.331
I had the situation
under control.

47:12.332 --> 47:14.333
You look like a seagull

47:14.334 --> 47:16.335
cleaned up after an oil spill.

47:16.336 --> 47:18.337
So I swooped in
and saved the day.

47:18.338 --> 47:20.339
That's how heroes roll.

47:20.340 --> 47:21.340
You've seen me play
Capture the Flag.

47:21.341 --> 47:23.342
Yeah, I have.

47:23.343 --> 47:24.343
You take it way too far.

47:24.344 --> 47:28.347
The point is to
capture the flag.

47:28.348 --> 47:31.350
Okay, you kidnapped their queen

47:31.351 --> 47:33.352
and gave them new
and interesting reasons

47:33.353 --> 47:35.354
to hate me.

47:35.355 --> 47:36.355
Not to mention we lost
the one guy

47:36.356 --> 47:37.774
who can end this nightmare.

47:37.775 --> 47:40.359
Because his phone
was in his pants,

47:40.360 --> 47:44.073
and his pants were in
your ill-conceived rope.

47:44.074 --> 47:45.364
A hero wouldn't have
made that mistake.

47:45.365 --> 47:47.366
Oh, you're not a hero.

47:47.367 --> 47:49.369
You're not even
a good sidekick.

47:50.788 --> 47:53.372
Somebody needs couples therapy.

47:53.373 --> 47:55.374
You know, you're welcome
to leave whenever.

47:55.375 --> 47:57.376
Oh, I'm staying.

47:57.377 --> 47:58.377
Any time away from my brothers

47:58.378 --> 48:00.379
is a breath of fresh air.

48:00.380 --> 48:03.382
No joke; The whole house
smells like meatballs and B.O.

48:03.383 --> 48:05.802
And technically speaking,

48:05.803 --> 48:08.387
I'm the only licensed driver.

48:08.388 --> 48:10.389
Well, then,
technically speaking,

48:10.390 --> 48:12.391
thrilled to have ya.

48:12.392 --> 48:15.394
I emerged from the underworld

48:15.395 --> 48:17.814
reborn like a phoenix.

48:17.815 --> 48:19.398
How could I not be the hero?

48:19.399 --> 48:22.236
Okay, okay, guys.

48:22.237 --> 48:24.403
We're dangerously close to
going off the rails here.

48:24.404 --> 48:26.405
The most important thing now

48:26.406 --> 48:28.407
is to just find
our last, best hope.

48:28.408 --> 48:32.412
Hey, check out this weirdo
drifter on that tiny bike.

48:34.414 --> 48:36.833
Is he not wearing pants?

48:36.834 --> 48:40.419
Oh, sweet mercy, you're here.

48:40.420 --> 48:42.421
My calves are on fire.

48:42.422 --> 48:43.840
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

48:43.841 --> 48:47.427
- Abandoning us, leaving your nephew.
- By marriage!

48:47.428 --> 48:50.389
The only way my family
line has survived

48:50.390 --> 48:52.391
is by fleeing at
the first sign of danger.

48:52.392 --> 48:53.432
Get in the car, Glenn.

48:53.433 --> 48:56.435
I can't. My legs are useless.

48:56.436 --> 48:59.439
And I gotta return this bike
to that sweet little girl.

49:03.444 --> 49:05.570
If he asks me to massage
a cramp, I quit.

49:05.571 --> 49:08.447
- ( Cell phone beeps )
- Not that you need my help,

49:08.448 --> 49:11.450
but we're right near the bus's
third stop at Dearborn Junction.

49:11.451 --> 49:14.453
Glenn, we have to move,
and we have to move right now.

49:14.454 --> 49:17.456
You're gonna have
to massage my legs.

49:17.457 --> 49:19.419
WILSON: Not it!

49:26.466 --> 49:30.469
Oh, man, they got
a Beepo's taco truck?

49:30.470 --> 49:32.597
This party's gonna be
off the hook.

49:32.598 --> 49:35.474
This party's for third graders?

49:35.475 --> 49:39.479
Don't hate the playa.
Hate the game.

49:41.481 --> 49:43.482
By the way, nobody mention

49:43.483 --> 49:45.319
that I'm wearing my mom's
aerobic shirt, all right?

49:45.320 --> 49:47.486
It was in the trunk,
and it's dry.

49:47.487 --> 49:49.488
Plus I look really good
in violet.

49:49.489 --> 49:51.490
I hope your mom's rig
can run on fumes,

49:51.491 --> 49:53.492
because I don't know if
I trust the gas gauge

49:53.493 --> 49:55.329
with all the dead weight
we're carrying.

49:55.330 --> 49:58.497
I think he's talking about you.

49:58.498 --> 50:00.499
And not that I deserve
any credit

50:00.500 --> 50:03.502
for saving the mission
from certain failure yet again,

50:03.503 --> 50:06.506
but the bus stop
is coming up fast.

50:10.345 --> 50:12.346
Glenn, I hope you have
your speech prepared.

50:12.347 --> 50:14.513
Just the dance sequence. But I'm
pretty sure the words will come.

50:14.514 --> 50:17.517
- Then let's do this!
- ( Siren wailing )

50:20.520 --> 50:23.357
- Come on! - Really?
- You owe me a wife!

50:23.358 --> 50:25.524
Guys, emergency vehicles
have the right of way.

50:25.525 --> 50:27.527
Test number four.
I know what I'm doing.

50:29.529 --> 50:31.530
Hey, aren't those the guys

50:31.531 --> 50:34.533
who stiffed us
on our transport fee?

50:34.534 --> 50:36.535
Maybe we can get
20 bucks out of them for lunch.

50:36.536 --> 50:39.538
The rules of the road
are rules for a reason.

50:39.539 --> 50:41.540
Back me up, Glenn.

50:41.541 --> 50:44.086
Sorry? I was distracted by this
ambulance barreling towards us.

50:44.087 --> 50:46.546
They found us! Scatter!

50:48.548 --> 50:50.549
What a wuss.

50:50.550 --> 50:52.553
You're the one
who owes them money.

50:55.555 --> 50:56.556
Wait up!

51:09.569 --> 51:10.570
( Siren in the distance)

51:11.571 --> 51:12.571
- ( car honks )
- Whoa Whoa!

51:12.572 --> 51:14.409
Come on! Today is not the day.

51:29.589 --> 51:31.591
Ah, it's more trouble
than its worth.

51:32.592 --> 51:33.592
I've to go pick up the guy that

51:33.593 --> 51:34.874
fell out of that
hot air balloon.

51:40.600 --> 51:42.601
( Sighs )

51:42.602 --> 51:44.405
GIRL: We'll take three
of the ganache, please.

51:49.609 --> 51:51.611
( Whispers )
Oh, the universe hates me.

51:52.612 --> 51:53.612
( Sighs )

51:53.613 --> 51:55.157
Don't hide from me.

51:55.158 --> 51:56.159
I see you.

51:58.618 --> 51:59.618
There you are.

51:59.619 --> 52:01.746
Yummy vanilla.

52:01.747 --> 52:03.623
Hiding behind the red velvet.

52:07.627 --> 52:09.047
We'll take these too, please.

52:15.345 --> 52:16.635
So, is that nice Mark boy

52:16.636 --> 52:18.055
still taking you
to Monica's pool party?

52:18.056 --> 52:21.640
Not sure.
We do weird phone call.

52:21.641 --> 52:23.204
I think Dean Greaves
might be taking us.

52:25.188 --> 52:27.647
Crowd management,
real time traffic for miles,

52:27.648 --> 52:30.649
fuel consumption,
road snacks...

52:30.650 --> 52:34.613
I give and I give and
all he does is take.

52:34.614 --> 52:35.655
Don't even get me started.

52:35.656 --> 52:38.657
I feel like that with
my brother sometimes too.

52:38.658 --> 52:40.659
Well, all the time, actually.

52:40.660 --> 52:43.622
The important thing is
not to take it personally.

52:43.623 --> 52:45.665
Specially since we have
no idea where he went.

52:47.667 --> 52:48.960
I stand corrected.

52:48.961 --> 52:50.669
What are you dummies
doing just sitting here?

52:50.670 --> 52:52.671
Ashley is in that store,

52:52.672 --> 52:55.155
along with a million questions
that I don't know how to answer.

53:00.680 --> 53:02.225
Oh, these cup cakes are perfect.

53:03.683 --> 53:04.976
Watch where you're going!

53:04.977 --> 53:05.698
( Ashley screams )

53:11.691 --> 53:12.818
( gasps )

53:14.694 --> 53:16.530
OK. If Ashley sees us...

53:16.531 --> 53:18.697
she's going to ask Dean Greaves
to take her to the party.

53:18.698 --> 53:19.698
Super.

53:19.699 --> 53:21.700
MARK: Not super!

53:21.701 --> 53:24.703
Totally super.
Dean Greaves is terrific.

53:24.704 --> 53:27.706
Charming, dreamy eyes.
Plays guitar.

53:27.707 --> 53:28.833
When life gives
you Dean Greaves,

53:28.834 --> 53:30.709
you make Dean Greaves hate.

53:30.710 --> 53:31.711
( Imitates Russell )

53:35.715 --> 53:37.009
Oh good.

53:37.010 --> 53:38.552
Ashley's gone.

53:38.553 --> 53:40.719
( Police radio )

53:40.720 --> 53:42.721
And Glenn just got arrested.

53:42.722 --> 53:44.434
Call me.

53:51.731 --> 53:52.731
Well, they're
reducing the charges

53:52.732 --> 53:55.027
for him stealing
the little girl's bike.

53:55.028 --> 53:58.030
But, he's still in the hook
for being in his underwear.

53:58.031 --> 54:00.739
Yo! I got places to be!

54:00.740 --> 54:03.742
This karate body needs protein.

54:03.743 --> 54:07.039
So, now we have to bail him out
and save his marriage?

54:07.040 --> 54:10.167
Where are we supposed
to get seventy five bucks?

54:10.168 --> 54:12.751
And $25 for him
being in his underwear.

54:12.752 --> 54:14.753
He told me that
was a bathing suit.

54:14.754 --> 54:17.756
He said it was because he did
not have any more clean laundry.

54:17.757 --> 54:19.051
( Heaves )

54:19.052 --> 54:21.760
It's times like this
you have to ask yourself.

54:21.761 --> 54:23.597
Wouldn't it be
easier if you just

54:23.598 --> 54:25.307
build your own pool and
have your own party?

54:25.308 --> 54:26.765
I've got a really good idea.

54:26.766 --> 54:29.768
Why doesn't Russell call
his new best friend,

54:29.769 --> 54:31.771
Dean Greaves to come in
and save the day.

54:31.772 --> 54:34.773
I know you're just being
flippant, but he totally would.

54:34.774 --> 54:37.777
Remember those?
He saved from those wild dogs.

54:37.778 --> 54:40.614
Yo, check it!
A Happy Scratcher!

54:40.615 --> 54:43.782
Wilson got three pineapples
and a dollar sign.

54:43.783 --> 54:45.495
Cha-ching, yo!

54:46.786 --> 54:47.912
Is he speaking emoji?

54:47.913 --> 54:49.081
Check it.

54:49.082 --> 54:50.790
Wilson's flush.

54:52.210 --> 54:53.793
( All panic )

54:55.921 --> 54:57.796
Those are my grandpa's
Happy Scratchers

54:57.797 --> 54:58.923
and mine by birthright.

54:58.924 --> 55:01.800
And you have to be eighteen
to cash them in, tough guy.

55:01.801 --> 55:03.802
Hand over the tickets, Wilson.

55:03.803 --> 55:05.515
( Car locks )

55:07.517 --> 55:08.807
- ( car unlocks )
- ( Car locks)

55:08.808 --> 55:10.809
- ( car unlocks )
- ( Car locks)

55:10.810 --> 55:12.812
( car unlocks
and locks simultaneously )

55:14.774 --> 55:15.815
( punching sounds )

55:18.818 --> 55:21.780
Let a real man handle this.

55:21.781 --> 55:22.821
I just want to put you
in my pocket.

55:22.822 --> 55:24.367
Bring it.

55:25.825 --> 55:27.827
( Moans )

55:29.829 --> 55:32.831
I draw the line at hitting
eight year olds.

55:32.832 --> 55:33.959
Unless they're family.

55:36.546 --> 55:37.962
We need that ticket, Wilson.

55:37.963 --> 55:39.674
What's it going to take?

55:47.682 --> 55:50.684
Got karate master's
head honor, Wilson.

55:50.685 --> 55:52.851
Where's the honor in blackmail?

55:52.852 --> 55:54.853
When Wilson's late
for a jammy-jam...

55:54.854 --> 55:56.690
Wilson plays dirty.

55:56.691 --> 55:57.856
So the kid will do anything

55:57.857 --> 56:00.859
to get to a super cool
popular kid party.

56:00.860 --> 56:02.861
Sure that's something
you can get behind.

56:02.862 --> 56:04.863
And I'm sure there's
a gas station near by.

56:04.864 --> 56:06.700
Just saying.

56:06.701 --> 56:07.867
You know, with our
suspicious gas gauge.

56:07.868 --> 56:10.869
Just tell me
where the street is.

56:10.870 --> 56:13.832
Or should we get Dean Greaves
to navigate for us?

56:13.833 --> 56:16.710
If you had quit bickering like
a couple of cats in a bag,

56:16.711 --> 56:19.714
you'd see that big dope's
jammy-jam is right there.

56:24.844 --> 56:25.885
( Indistinct crowd )

56:35.895 --> 56:36.895
Short guy,

56:36.896 --> 56:37.897
Mitch,

56:37.898 --> 56:39.898
girl whose name
I can't remember,

56:39.899 --> 56:41.027
catch you on the flip.

56:46.906 --> 56:47.907
( Sighs )

56:52.205 --> 56:53.912
Wilson.

56:53.913 --> 56:55.914
Don't tell me it's a pool party.

56:55.915 --> 56:58.918
No doubt. Wilson's gonna
get his snuggle on.

57:05.925 --> 57:07.927
I really need to
get that license.

57:07.928 --> 57:09.638
Let's go bail Glenn out.

57:09.639 --> 57:10.929
Unless...

57:10.930 --> 57:14.933
Don't you dare say Dean Greaves.

57:14.934 --> 57:17.646
- Then we should really...
- Don't you dare

57:17.647 --> 57:19.648
say Knobbler's Field!

57:19.649 --> 57:21.940
My mom's car has been
through enough already.

57:21.941 --> 57:23.942
Knobbler's Field
is off the table.

57:23.943 --> 57:26.945
Dean Greaves is off the table!
You know what?

57:26.946 --> 57:29.366
Anything that comes out
your mouth, off the table!

57:29.367 --> 57:30.949
You say that now, Forehead.

57:30.950 --> 57:32.494
- ( Gasps )
- But you always

57:32.495 --> 57:33.952
take my advice in the end.

57:33.953 --> 57:37.374
Hey! It's just a pool party.

57:37.375 --> 57:38.957
Just a pool party?

57:38.958 --> 57:41.960
Just a pool party?

57:41.961 --> 57:45.964
This license.
Leveling up. Ashley.

57:45.965 --> 57:47.926
It is everything to me!

57:47.927 --> 57:49.968
Boy, I close my eyes...

57:49.969 --> 57:51.970
You almost sound like Glenn.

57:51.971 --> 57:54.973
Who wants to go to
a pool party with Glenn?

57:54.974 --> 57:56.975
Who wants to go to
a pool party with you?

57:56.976 --> 57:59.978
With your cheap phones
and your Mole Man

57:59.979 --> 58:00.979
and your sparkling
cider lunches.

58:00.980 --> 58:02.981
- Brunches!
- Oh, whatever!

58:02.982 --> 58:04.983
It's embarrassing.

58:04.984 --> 58:06.945
And plus, you were
never even invited.

58:06.946 --> 58:08.987
( Snorts )

58:08.988 --> 58:11.990
No. I don't need
your stupid pool party.

58:11.991 --> 58:14.994
I got Wilson's. Have fun
choking on your sixth failures.

58:17.540 --> 58:18.997
Fine! Go!

58:18.998 --> 58:21.001
We'll move faster without you.

58:30.010 --> 58:32.011
Kinda takes the wind
out of your sails

58:32.012 --> 58:34.013
when you gotta stop in
the middle of your big moment.

58:34.014 --> 58:35.014
Doesn't it, drama queen?

58:35.015 --> 58:36.015
Test number one.

58:36.016 --> 58:39.018
Three seconds.
Not before. Not after.

58:39.019 --> 58:42.021
But, squarely at the stop sign.

58:42.022 --> 58:44.566
I don't write the rules, Angela.

58:44.567 --> 58:47.027
Nope. You just die by them.

58:53.033 --> 58:55.034
GLENN:
Thanks again for springing me

58:55.035 --> 58:56.035
from the big house, guys.

58:56.036 --> 58:58.037
Now, back to our Karen quest.

58:58.038 --> 58:59.039
MARK: Guys.

59:02.042 --> 59:04.043
Oh!

59:04.044 --> 59:05.044
Frosty in here.

59:05.045 --> 59:07.046
I haven't felt anything
this tense since.

59:07.047 --> 59:09.048
Knifey Pete and New Fish Wingo
went at it in the yard.

59:09.049 --> 59:12.011
It did not end well
for Knifey Pete.

59:12.012 --> 59:14.053
Well, while you were making
colorful new friends...

59:14.054 --> 59:17.056
Let me catch you up on what
happened here in the real world.

59:17.057 --> 59:19.058
Bail money for you...

59:19.059 --> 59:20.059
Karate fights...

59:20.060 --> 59:22.061
A conga line of blue-hairs.

59:22.062 --> 59:23.605
Mark chased away
his only friend.

59:23.606 --> 59:25.064
One more thing.

59:25.065 --> 59:28.067
We missed the bus's final stop
before Steubensville

59:28.068 --> 59:30.069
and our last chance of catching
your wife is slipping away.

59:30.070 --> 59:32.072
All right. Can it with
the monologue, Shakespeare.

59:32.073 --> 59:33.073
Work that peddle.

59:33.074 --> 59:34.366
Why?

59:34.367 --> 59:36.075
What's the point?

59:36.076 --> 59:38.077
We're never going to
beat her bur to Steubensville.

59:38.078 --> 59:39.496
We're doomed.

59:39.497 --> 59:41.373
Unless some sign appears
out of nowhere

59:41.374 --> 59:43.083
to magically show us the way.

01:00:01.101 --> 01:00:03.102
GLENN:
We are making excellent time.

01:00:03.103 --> 01:00:04.814
Great idea, Mark.

01:00:06.106 --> 01:00:07.649
( Sighs )

01:00:07.650 --> 01:00:09.108
So you're just going to
keep on driving?

01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:11.110
Like nothing's wrong?

01:00:11.111 --> 01:00:13.112
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

01:00:13.113 --> 01:00:16.115
Even when he's not here,
he's saving your butt.

01:00:16.116 --> 01:00:17.242
Not cool, bro!

01:00:17.243 --> 01:00:19.118
OK! Fine!

01:00:19.119 --> 01:00:22.121
Yeah, Russell scored with
a Knobbler's Field shortcut.

01:00:22.122 --> 01:00:25.124
So what? Doesn't mean
he's right about everything.

01:00:25.125 --> 01:00:27.126
You know, he told me
to close the sun roof,

01:00:27.127 --> 01:00:29.249
so the bugs wouldn't get in.
Nothing's happened there.

01:00:36.136 --> 01:00:37.680
Doesn't count. Too delightful.

01:00:40.850 --> 01:00:42.142
These things
on the other hand...

01:00:43.269 --> 01:00:45.687
A menace.

01:00:45.688 --> 01:00:47.147
MARK: Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:00:55.155 --> 01:00:58.158
GLENN: He is literally
inside my nostrils.

01:01:02.162 --> 01:01:04.707
Oh, Russell was right
about the sun roof.

01:01:12.172 --> 01:01:13.715
Whoa!

01:01:13.716 --> 01:01:17.177
GLENN: Am I OK? I think it
might have scratched me.

01:01:22.142 --> 01:01:24.143
No. No, you're good.

01:01:24.144 --> 01:01:27.186
OK. Russell was right
about two things. So what?

01:01:27.187 --> 01:01:30.150
Even a broken clock
is right twice a day. Right?

01:01:32.027 --> 01:01:34.487
Wha-what's that flashing
nozzle on the dash mean?

01:01:37.197 --> 01:01:39.198
( All grunting )

01:01:39.199 --> 01:01:41.200
MARK: Oh, come on.

01:01:41.201 --> 01:01:43.037
Put your back into it.

01:01:43.038 --> 01:01:44.203
The gas station's less
than a mile this way.

01:01:44.204 --> 01:01:47.206
Over the river and
through the woods.

01:01:47.207 --> 01:01:49.751
Somebody suggested
we fill up earlier.

01:01:49.752 --> 01:01:52.754
Something about
a faulty gas gauge.

01:01:52.755 --> 01:01:54.213
The name's on
the tip of my tongue.

01:01:54.214 --> 01:01:57.216
OK! OK! All right!

01:01:57.217 --> 01:02:00.220
I admit it. Russell was right.
He was right about everything.

01:02:00.221 --> 01:02:04.223
The shortcut. The sun roof.
The gas gauge. The dead weight.

01:02:04.224 --> 01:02:07.226
I think he's talking about you.

01:02:07.227 --> 01:02:09.229
You name it,
Russell was right about it.

01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:12.191
Hey.

01:02:12.192 --> 01:02:13.232
Don't take it so hard.

01:02:13.233 --> 01:02:15.234
I mean, look around.

01:02:15.235 --> 01:02:17.236
It's beautiful here.

01:02:17.237 --> 01:02:19.238
And someone recently told me

01:02:19.239 --> 01:02:21.240
that dickcissel is
in mating season.

01:02:21.241 --> 01:02:23.077
That was Russell.

01:02:23.078 --> 01:02:25.244
( Sighs )
Yeah, I miss that kid.

01:02:25.245 --> 01:02:26.371
He's great.

01:02:26.372 --> 01:02:28.248
I wanted him to come
to the pool party.

01:02:28.249 --> 01:02:30.249
I really did.

01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:32.211
He's just nervous.

01:02:32.212 --> 01:02:34.088
He can come out
a little strong sometimes.

01:02:34.089 --> 01:02:36.255
I mean, you guys have never
seen him play capture the flag.

01:02:36.256 --> 01:02:38.257
I don't blame you Mark.

01:02:38.258 --> 01:02:40.259
I mean, when my buddy
with the orthopedic shoes

01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:41.678
started cramping my style,

01:02:41.679 --> 01:02:46.265
I dropped him like a bad habit
and went straight to Karen town.

01:02:46.266 --> 01:02:50.269
But, not because
of the orthopedic shoes.

01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:51.271
That's prejudice.

01:02:53.273 --> 01:02:54.983
Sweet gherkin.

01:02:54.984 --> 01:02:56.276
I am glad.

01:03:00.406 --> 01:03:02.407
I guess Russell was
right about everything.

01:03:02.408 --> 01:03:04.283
Can't believe it.

01:03:04.284 --> 01:03:08.287
I was embarrassed
about him but...

01:03:08.288 --> 01:03:10.290
I- I should have
been embarrassed about me.

01:03:11.584 --> 01:03:13.293
I choked.

01:03:14.294 --> 01:03:17.296
I choked at friendship.
( sighs )

01:03:17.297 --> 01:03:19.716
And the truth shall
set you free.

01:03:19.717 --> 01:03:23.302
Though technically
we're still stuck in a field...

01:03:23.303 --> 01:03:24.304
in the rain...

01:03:24.305 --> 01:03:26.305
because of you.

01:03:26.306 --> 01:03:30.309
Who cares about
that stupid pool party.

01:03:30.310 --> 01:03:32.311
I would rather just spend
the rest of my days

01:03:32.312 --> 01:03:34.313
as a regular Mark,

01:03:34.314 --> 01:03:36.733
as long as I just got
my best friend back.

01:03:36.734 --> 01:03:39.319
RUSSELL: That would sound
lovely in a tasteful card.

01:03:40.321 --> 01:03:42.321
Quality card stock.

01:03:42.322 --> 01:03:43.322
Something classy.

01:03:43.323 --> 01:03:44.323
Eggshell is nice.

01:03:44.324 --> 01:03:46.325
- ANGELA: Oh, Russell!
- MARK: Buddy!

01:03:46.326 --> 01:03:47.327
Tell me you brought food.

01:03:53.333 --> 01:03:55.169
How'd you know we'd be here?

01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:58.337
What can I say? You always
take my advice in the end.

01:03:58.338 --> 01:04:00.339
Snap!

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:02.341
Plus, I-I knew you'd
forget to gas up,

01:04:02.342 --> 01:04:04.343
and I know how much
that party means to you.

01:04:04.344 --> 01:04:07.181
That an-and not
dying in a field.

01:04:07.182 --> 01:04:08.348
You do know me.

01:04:10.768 --> 01:04:12.769
So, how was Wilson's pool party?

01:04:12.770 --> 01:04:14.353
He said I was on the list.

01:04:14.354 --> 01:04:18.357
Big Dub does run with a
pretty exclusive party crowd.

01:04:18.358 --> 01:04:21.361
Primo cake, I'm told.

01:04:25.366 --> 01:04:27.326
MARK: You know,

01:04:27.327 --> 01:04:28.367
when this is all over,

01:04:28.368 --> 01:04:30.787
I owe you a
sparkling cider brunch.

01:04:30.788 --> 01:04:32.371
RUSSELL: Oh, Mark.

01:04:32.372 --> 01:04:33.373
Those are so last year.

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:37.377
( All sighing and gasping )

01:04:39.379 --> 01:04:40.379
All right.

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:43.382
Tank full.
No permanent injuries.

01:04:43.383 --> 01:04:45.386
Russell's earned a well
deserved power nap.

01:04:48.388 --> 01:04:51.390
I can't understand why
I like him so much.

01:04:51.391 --> 01:04:53.518
I think he reminds me
of the doll I once had.

01:04:53.519 --> 01:04:57.396
Yo, Glenn,
how's that speech coming?

01:04:57.397 --> 01:04:59.398
"You are the corn to my cob"

01:04:59.399 --> 01:05:01.818
"and are at
your best with butter."

01:05:01.819 --> 01:05:03.402
Karen loves butter.

01:05:03.403 --> 01:05:04.946
Keep thinking.

01:05:04.947 --> 01:05:06.405
You know, I'm proud
of you, Mark.

01:05:06.406 --> 01:05:08.407
You shook it off and,
lo and behold,

01:05:08.408 --> 01:05:10.410
the light at
the end of the tunnel.

01:05:16.416 --> 01:05:19.418
( Car honking )

01:05:19.419 --> 01:05:22.421
You know, the problem with the
light at the end of the tunnel,

01:05:22.422 --> 01:05:24.424
there's always a darkness
right behind you.

01:05:32.432 --> 01:05:34.433
Oh, no.

01:05:34.434 --> 01:05:35.434
Beast mode.

01:05:35.435 --> 01:05:38.437
Here's Nicos!

01:05:38.438 --> 01:05:39.438
How did they find us?

01:05:39.439 --> 01:05:40.982
You know, I may have
mentioned Steubensville

01:05:40.983 --> 01:05:43.442
in that fourth or
fifth grid cycle.

01:05:43.443 --> 01:05:46.445
Right before that really
moving speech I gave earlier.

01:05:46.446 --> 01:05:48.282
He told us exactly
where he's going to be

01:05:48.283 --> 01:05:50.449
in that super dumb speech
he gave earlier.

01:05:50.450 --> 01:05:51.451
What an idiot!

01:05:58.458 --> 01:06:00.459
There she is!

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:03.462
Is that the bus?
Did I say, "Throw it to me?"

01:06:03.463 --> 01:06:06.465
So much optimism
in such a tiny body.

01:06:06.466 --> 01:06:07.466
We're gaining.

01:06:07.467 --> 01:06:09.303
Wait! Pull over here.

01:06:09.304 --> 01:06:10.469
- What?
- Are you crazy?

01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:12.181
You owe me a power nap!

01:06:12.182 --> 01:06:14.308
Non negotiable pit stop.

01:06:14.309 --> 01:06:15.474
Trust me.

01:06:15.475 --> 01:06:17.476
I know what I'm doing.

01:06:17.477 --> 01:06:19.314
OK. When you
put it that way, no!

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:21.898
Stubborn as a mule.

01:06:21.899 --> 01:06:23.901
Just like I was when
I was your age.

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:26.486
MARK: Get out!

01:06:35.495 --> 01:06:37.496
I don't know how quick an ulcer

01:06:37.497 --> 01:06:40.500
can form in a teenage body
but, ho, ho, ho!

01:06:40.501 --> 01:06:43.046
I swear he's helped me
set a record.

01:06:53.514 --> 01:06:55.475
Come on.

01:07:02.522 --> 01:07:04.523
Carrots and vegetables.

01:07:04.524 --> 01:07:06.068
Point Glenn.

01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:08.653
( Car screeches )

01:07:08.654 --> 01:07:12.531
By the way, why is your dry cleaner
all the way in Steubensville?

01:07:12.532 --> 01:07:13.532
Cheapest rates around.

01:07:13.533 --> 01:07:15.370
( Groans )

01:07:27.547 --> 01:07:29.548
All right. We're
on the goal line

01:07:29.549 --> 01:07:30.675
with two seconds left
on the clock.

01:07:30.676 --> 01:07:33.553
We're unstoppable!

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:43.562
We're going to strap your ride!

01:07:43.563 --> 01:07:44.564
And eat your bones!

01:07:45.565 --> 01:07:47.567
Would you believe me
if I told you

01:07:47.568 --> 01:07:49.570
he was the one
with most potential.

01:07:58.578 --> 01:08:00.579
One car length. One car length!

01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:02.581
I mean, you guys
are seeing this right?

01:08:02.582 --> 01:08:03.582
My last test.

01:08:03.583 --> 01:08:05.544
Young man...

01:08:05.545 --> 01:08:06.585
I may not have always shown it,

01:08:06.586 --> 01:08:09.590
but I admire your commitment
to vehicular safety.

01:08:14.887 --> 01:08:16.555
Oops!

01:08:21.435 --> 01:08:22.600
MARK: Even when you
try to be nice,

01:08:22.602 --> 01:08:23.729
you ruin things.

01:08:31.611 --> 01:08:33.612
Yo, tie this suit
behind the seat,

01:08:33.613 --> 01:08:35.615
we'll swap it for cash
at the Suit Palace later.

01:08:39.618 --> 01:08:41.621
( Cellphone ringing )

01:08:44.624 --> 01:08:46.625
GLENN: Sorry, ah, ah, Ashley.

01:08:46.626 --> 01:08:49.587
Um, Mark can't come
to the phone right now.

01:08:49.589 --> 01:08:50.629
Um, he's under
extreme pressure,

01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:52.631
and I don't want him
soiling his pants

01:08:52.631 --> 01:08:54.633
in front of pretty girl.

01:08:54.634 --> 01:08:56.635
Mark, Hello?

01:08:56.636 --> 01:08:58.636
Hello, Ashley.

01:08:58.638 --> 01:09:01.058
That was my uncle, we're
taking him to the hospital.

01:09:01.059 --> 01:09:02.767
Something's not right
with his head.

01:09:02.768 --> 01:09:05.644
But Mark is really...
Double bag, double bag...

01:09:05.645 --> 01:09:07.645
Suitcase on the left.

01:09:07.647 --> 01:09:09.066
RUSSELL: Designer
man purse straight ahead.

01:09:09.067 --> 01:09:09.747
GLENN: Snowboard.

01:09:13.653 --> 01:09:15.654
Ah... I don't get it.

01:09:21.661 --> 01:09:23.663
( Gasps )

01:09:28.794 --> 01:09:30.670
ALL: Ah!

01:09:32.671 --> 01:09:34.674
( All grunting )

01:09:35.675 --> 01:09:37.676
<i>Is Mark there?</i>

01:09:37.676 --> 01:09:40.639
Yes, I mean, yes.

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:41.640
I'm here.

01:09:43.684 --> 01:09:45.684
I know I was weird earlier,

01:09:45.685 --> 01:09:48.687
but, I learned something today.

01:09:48.688 --> 01:09:52.109
A pool party
is just a pool party.

01:09:52.109 --> 01:09:53.692
Is that party really worth it

01:09:53.693 --> 01:09:55.988
if you're not partying in the
pool with people you love?

01:09:58.698 --> 01:10:00.699
I was actually just calling

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:01.700
to remind you
to bring sunscreen,

01:10:01.701 --> 01:10:03.702
it's supposed to be pretty hot.

01:10:03.703 --> 01:10:06.706
Mark, do you still want to go
to this party with me?

01:10:08.708 --> 01:10:10.710
<i>Miss a party
with nice-teeth Ashley?</i>

01:10:11.711 --> 01:10:12.711
<i>Never.</i>

01:10:12.712 --> 01:10:15.840
Oh, exciting news.

01:10:15.841 --> 01:10:17.716
I decided to bring a plus one.

01:10:17.717 --> 01:10:20.720
Or more accurately,
a plus half.

01:10:20.721 --> 01:10:23.140
( Russell screams )

01:10:23.141 --> 01:10:24.724
See you at the party.

01:10:31.731 --> 01:10:34.151
MARK: All right,
it's the end of our quest.

01:10:34.152 --> 01:10:36.153
As long as we don't
screw the things up.

01:10:36.154 --> 01:10:37.736
I think...

01:10:37.737 --> 01:10:40.739
There's only one way
this can go down.

01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:42.741
We're gonna have
to cannonball this thing.

01:10:42.742 --> 01:10:44.743
Or we could just meet her
at the station.

01:10:44.744 --> 01:10:48.582
My situation demands
a grand gesture.

01:10:48.583 --> 01:10:51.750
It's go big
or go home, broheim.

01:10:51.751 --> 01:10:52.751
Or go die,

01:10:52.752 --> 01:10:54.754
which is the more
likely outcome.

01:10:55.755 --> 01:10:57.756
Glenn, get back in the car.

01:10:57.757 --> 01:11:00.594
Too late. This is my destiny.

01:11:00.595 --> 01:11:01.760
MARK: Glenn, this is crazy.

01:11:01.761 --> 01:11:03.763
How are you gonna even hold on?

01:11:04.764 --> 01:11:06.765
You let me worry about that.

01:11:06.766 --> 01:11:08.311
( Music playing )

01:11:09.729 --> 01:11:12.772
GLENN:
Toodle-bear! Karen! Karen!

01:11:12.773 --> 01:11:16.777
Karen!
( screeching ) Toodle-bear!

01:11:18.778 --> 01:11:21.782
MARK: Please don't be dead.
Please don't be dead...

01:11:23.618 --> 01:11:27.786
Clown college means
everything to me, Karen.

01:11:27.787 --> 01:11:29.498
Please tell me I can go.

01:11:29.499 --> 01:11:31.790
Sure.

01:11:31.791 --> 01:11:35.087
Baby, just get in the car.

01:11:35.088 --> 01:11:37.756
I love you, Toodle-bear.

01:11:37.757 --> 01:11:39.798
I hope he doesn't
remember any of this.

01:11:39.799 --> 01:11:42.802
Because we're not paying
for clown college.

01:11:49.935 --> 01:11:52.812
There she is,
we're not too late.

01:12:01.821 --> 01:12:03.822
All we have to do is
just buy Glenn a few minutes.

01:12:03.823 --> 01:12:05.824
Unless a few minutes
is all he has left.

01:12:05.825 --> 01:12:06.825
MARK: Ah.

01:12:06.826 --> 01:12:08.662
Slow down, Forehead.

01:12:08.663 --> 01:12:10.829
I've a perfectly
normal-sized forehead.

01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:13.833
You think you can
cost me my license,

01:12:13.834 --> 01:12:15.835
steal my sister,

01:12:15.836 --> 01:12:17.836
ding up my
beast-mode accessories,

01:12:17.837 --> 01:12:19.838
and get off scot-free?

01:12:19.839 --> 01:12:21.966
Technically,
we borrowed your sister,

01:12:21.967 --> 01:12:23.842
and if it makes
feel any better,

01:12:23.843 --> 01:12:25.137
I'm sure I could find some
reasonably priced

01:12:25.138 --> 01:12:27.846
beast-mode accessories
on the internet.

01:12:27.847 --> 01:12:29.808
Ugh, again?

01:12:29.809 --> 01:12:31.851
Why do we have
to be those people?

01:12:33.853 --> 01:12:35.854
Angela...

01:12:35.855 --> 01:12:38.857
You need to learn
when to speak up,

01:12:38.858 --> 01:12:41.860
and when to keep
your mouth shut.

01:12:41.861 --> 01:12:42.862
RUSSELL: And you...

01:12:44.864 --> 01:12:47.867
need to learn to relax.

01:12:52.165 --> 01:12:54.417
( Fighting )

01:12:55.875 --> 01:12:57.294
RUSSELL: My head!

01:12:57.295 --> 01:12:58.877
I don't want
to embarrass you, Gino,

01:12:58.878 --> 01:13:00.879
but you just got three-seconded

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:03.176
by someone who weighs
less than a bag of sugar.

01:13:04.884 --> 01:13:06.886
Russell, can I just say...

01:13:08.014 --> 01:13:10.889
wow, I was...

01:13:10.890 --> 01:13:13.310
It was simply majestic, man.
I mean...

01:13:13.311 --> 01:13:15.894
Don't mention it,
that's what heroes do.

01:13:15.895 --> 01:13:17.314
- ANGELA: Ooh.
- MARK: You see, here I am,

01:13:17.315 --> 01:13:19.441
just trying to give you
a nice compliment...

01:13:19.442 --> 01:13:20.899
Uh, fellas?

01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:22.902
( Background chatter )

01:13:28.326 --> 01:13:30.453
Go get that license.

01:13:50.930 --> 01:13:53.767
Oh, good, you're awake.

01:13:53.768 --> 01:13:55.934
Are you sure that
this is what you want?

01:13:55.935 --> 01:13:57.479
This is what I always wanted.

01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:59.938
Shia LaBeouf,

01:13:59.939 --> 01:14:02.942
I have always wanted
your autograph.

01:14:03.943 --> 01:14:06.945
Ah, Mrs. Glenn?

01:14:06.946 --> 01:14:08.947
Bufferton.

01:14:08.948 --> 01:14:10.949
I'm so sorry, I'm not sure
if you took his last name.

01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:12.786
If not I completely
understand why.

01:14:12.787 --> 01:14:13.952
Um, but your husband,

01:14:13.953 --> 01:14:16.915
he's got something
desperately to tell you.

01:14:16.916 --> 01:14:17.957
What's wrong with him?

01:14:18.958 --> 01:14:21.086
Outside of the usual stuff?

01:14:21.087 --> 01:14:22.961
I'd say probably head trauma.

01:14:22.962 --> 01:14:27.926
Look. I think it's great that
Glenn is making new friends,

01:14:27.927 --> 01:14:29.511
but, I've been
over this before,

01:14:29.512 --> 01:14:31.970
the spark is gone and so am I.

01:14:31.971 --> 01:14:35.392
Mrs. Glenn, I know you've got
reason to doubt him, but...

01:14:35.393 --> 01:14:37.976
Today, your husband
has pulled a calf muscle,

01:14:37.977 --> 01:14:38.977
done time,

01:14:38.978 --> 01:14:40.814
picked up out-of-the-way
dry cleaning,

01:14:40.815 --> 01:14:41.980
put together a four,

01:14:41.981 --> 01:14:44.983
may be a five serviceable
romantic speeches,

01:14:44.984 --> 01:14:46.985
babysat a self-entitled
karate champ.

01:14:46.986 --> 01:14:48.987
My mother's waiting.

01:14:48.988 --> 01:14:51.117
He-he bounced off
a bus for you.

01:14:54.829 --> 01:14:57.996
- No, he didn't.
- Yes, he did.

01:14:57.997 --> 01:15:00.125
He did all that stuff.

01:15:00.126 --> 01:15:03.002
For you.

01:15:03.003 --> 01:15:05.839
You may think that you want
a more glamorous life,

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:09.843
you know, one with
voice mails and a new car,

01:15:09.844 --> 01:15:13.012
but don't be so quick to throw
away what you already have.

01:15:13.013 --> 01:15:16.017
'Cause what you already have has
been fighting for you all day.

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:19.018
And if you have
someone in your life

01:15:19.019 --> 01:15:21.020
that knows you're
worth fighting for,

01:15:21.021 --> 01:15:23.858
then you're right,
that's not a spark.

01:15:25.025 --> 01:15:27.027
Mrs. Glenn, that's a fire.

01:15:31.031 --> 01:15:33.032
H- how do I know he'll change?

01:15:33.033 --> 01:15:35.034
You don't.

01:15:35.035 --> 01:15:37.037
But if you walk away now,
you're gonna blow it.

01:15:38.038 --> 01:15:39.581
Just trust me.

01:15:39.582 --> 01:15:43.042
I know a thing or two
about choking the clutch.

01:15:43.043 --> 01:15:45.044
Oh...

01:15:45.045 --> 01:15:46.755
Oh, I hate crying,

01:15:46.756 --> 01:15:48.174
almost as much as I hate fur.

01:15:49.884 --> 01:15:51.011
Oh.

01:15:57.892 --> 01:15:59.351
Toodle-bear?

01:15:59.352 --> 01:16:02.061
Is that you?

01:16:02.062 --> 01:16:04.481
Oh, honey, I miss you so much.

01:16:04.482 --> 01:16:06.065
I picked up your dry cleaning.

01:16:06.066 --> 01:16:09.068
It's scattered over Highway 46.

01:16:09.069 --> 01:16:10.070
Oh!

01:16:11.072 --> 01:16:13.072
They're not strangling
each other,

01:16:13.073 --> 01:16:14.073
that's gotta be
a good sign, right?

01:16:14.074 --> 01:16:16.075
- Yeah.
- True love.

01:16:16.076 --> 01:16:17.076
You know it when you see it.

01:16:17.077 --> 01:16:19.078
We did it! We did it!

01:16:19.079 --> 01:16:20.079
Good-bye, booger-covered rump!

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:22.082
Hello, Ashley!

01:16:25.085 --> 01:16:27.086
It's been fun, boys.

01:16:27.087 --> 01:16:29.088
But I should probably get back
to my gang of knuckleheads.

01:16:29.089 --> 01:16:31.216
It's almost dinnertime,

01:16:31.217 --> 01:16:34.094
and none of them are allowed
to use a stove.

01:16:36.096 --> 01:16:38.098
Hey, Angela.

01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:43.103
It wasn't a Taser,
it was an inhaler.

01:16:47.107 --> 01:16:48.108
I know.

01:16:53.113 --> 01:16:54.406
Oh.

01:16:54.407 --> 01:16:57.116
So this is what
victory feels like.

01:16:57.117 --> 01:16:58.117
Yeah, it is!

01:16:58.118 --> 01:16:59.118
( Both cheering )

01:16:59.119 --> 01:17:00.829
Can you believe it, man?

01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:02.121
We're just a twenty-minute
drive from the DMV,

01:17:02.122 --> 01:17:05.125
and only a signature away
from the Promised Land.

01:17:05.126 --> 01:17:08.127
Mr. Ninety-two percent pays off,
Thank you, internet.

01:17:08.128 --> 01:17:10.129
No, I'm actually glad
we helped him.

01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:12.131
You do good things
for good people,

01:17:12.132 --> 01:17:14.134
and good things just happen.

01:17:31.151 --> 01:17:32.151
WOMAN: Mark!

01:17:32.152 --> 01:17:34.153
Mark!

01:17:34.154 --> 01:17:38.157
Ashley and Dean,
do make a cute couple.

01:17:38.158 --> 01:17:42.162
You should probably
start working out.

01:17:43.163 --> 01:17:45.165
Cannonball!

01:17:57.177 --> 01:17:59.178
Glenn.

01:17:59.179 --> 01:18:00.179
Why are you doing this?

01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:02.141
Promises were made,

01:18:02.142 --> 01:18:03.182
deals were struck.

01:18:03.183 --> 01:18:04.601
Please come back.

01:18:04.602 --> 01:18:06.186
( Mark screams )

01:18:10.733 --> 01:18:12.192
Glenn's a jerk.

01:18:13.193 --> 01:18:15.194
I can't believe he left us.

01:18:15.195 --> 01:18:17.196
After everything
we did for him.

01:18:17.197 --> 01:18:20.199
What kind of a selfish monster
abandons his friends

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:23.203
and loved ones without
so much as second thought?

01:18:29.044 --> 01:18:31.045
You gotta call Angela, dude.

01:18:31.046 --> 01:18:32.337
She's only our legal chaperon.

01:18:32.338 --> 01:18:35.924
I can't call Angela.
We left on such a high.

01:18:35.925 --> 01:18:38.217
Just when I thought this day

01:18:38.218 --> 01:18:40.219
couldn't get
any more humiliating.

01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:41.220
I think it's kind of fun.

01:18:41.221 --> 01:18:43.223
( Tow truck towing )

01:18:49.229 --> 01:18:50.229
Pick up the pace, slick,

01:18:50.230 --> 01:18:52.231
and don't tell your sister.

01:18:52.232 --> 01:18:54.234
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

01:18:55.945 --> 01:18:57.237
( Tow truck towing )

01:19:06.246 --> 01:19:07.246
I just thought of
a few other things

01:19:07.247 --> 01:19:09.248
you can drive
without a license.

01:19:09.249 --> 01:19:10.249
Golf cart.

01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:12.251
Jet ski.

01:19:12.252 --> 01:19:15.254
Maybe like a big drill.

01:19:15.255 --> 01:19:17.256
That might be
a special class of license.

01:19:17.257 --> 01:19:19.258
Thanks, buddy, but...

01:19:19.259 --> 01:19:21.261
I really don't have it
in me to be cheered up.

01:19:28.268 --> 01:19:30.269
Most important thing
to do now...

01:19:30.270 --> 01:19:31.396
is to just make sure

01:19:31.397 --> 01:19:33.273
that I'm not grounded
for the rest of my life.

01:19:35.275 --> 01:19:37.397
On a scale of one to ten,
how important's that to you?

01:19:39.989 --> 01:19:40.990
( Mark gasps )

01:19:42.242 --> 01:19:44.826
There you guys are.

01:19:44.827 --> 01:19:48.288
We've been looking
for you everywhere.

01:19:54.294 --> 01:19:55.294
RUSSELL: Grounded for a month?

01:19:55.295 --> 01:19:57.296
You must be hating life
pretty hard right now.

01:19:57.297 --> 01:19:59.298
Ugh, it's not so bad.

01:19:59.299 --> 01:20:01.593
I got my loyal buddy
right across the way.

01:20:01.594 --> 01:20:03.302
It'll go by in a snap.

01:20:03.303 --> 01:20:06.305
So, I guess back
to the bus on Monday.

01:20:06.306 --> 01:20:07.306
And every day.

01:20:07.307 --> 01:20:08.308
Not for long.

01:20:09.602 --> 01:20:11.311
Heroes never say die.

01:20:12.312 --> 01:20:15.314
Hey, in case
you didn't realize,

01:20:15.315 --> 01:20:16.315
you didn't choke today.

01:20:16.316 --> 01:20:18.317
Sure, you gagged a little.

01:20:18.318 --> 01:20:19.318
RUSSELL:
But the luggage slalom,

01:20:19.319 --> 01:20:23.322
the maniac squirrel,
your magnificent speech,

01:20:23.323 --> 01:20:25.324
you passed your test.

01:20:25.325 --> 01:20:27.161
Even if you didn't you know...

01:20:27.162 --> 01:20:28.327
pass your test.

01:20:28.328 --> 01:20:30.455
You should be proud
of regular Mark.

01:20:30.456 --> 01:20:31.457
Thanks, buddy.

01:20:37.337 --> 01:20:39.338
You meant both
of us before, right?

01:20:39.339 --> 01:20:41.341
- We're both the heroes.
- Yes.

01:20:46.472 --> 01:20:49.348
( laughter )

01:20:49.349 --> 01:20:50.350
MAN: Thank you.

01:20:53.896 --> 01:20:56.356
WOMAN:
Oh, Glenn, you are a hoot!

01:21:05.365 --> 01:21:07.366
Who might this stranger be?

01:21:07.367 --> 01:21:10.369
And what has
this stranger told you?

01:21:10.370 --> 01:21:13.372
I think somebody has
a little explaining to do.

01:21:13.373 --> 01:21:15.375
How could you keep
this as a secret?

01:21:15.376 --> 01:21:17.919
Ah, ah...

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:21.380
I'm sure he was just
trying to surprise you.

01:21:21.381 --> 01:21:22.381
I mean, he-he got so excited,

01:21:22.382 --> 01:21:24.384
he left before
I could even tell him.

01:21:26.386 --> 01:21:28.387
Sometimes people
just get so caught up

01:21:28.388 --> 01:21:31.100
in the moment they take off.

01:21:31.101 --> 01:21:34.393
You know, I hear that's a thing.

01:21:34.394 --> 01:21:37.396
But since your house is so close
to my favorite corn dog stand,

01:21:37.397 --> 01:21:39.399
I'd figured
I'd drop it off myself.

01:22:01.421 --> 01:22:05.384
Congratulations, you earned it!

01:22:05.385 --> 01:22:06.425
Looks like the coolest cat
in this household

01:22:06.426 --> 01:22:08.428
just got a little bit cooler.

01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:12.431
By the way,

01:22:12.432 --> 01:22:13.432
you wouldn't happen to have
a pair of boxer briefs

01:22:13.433 --> 01:22:14.433
I could borrow, would you?

01:22:14.434 --> 01:22:16.435
I'm on day two
of a bathing suit

01:22:16.436 --> 01:22:17.855
and no clean laundry.

01:22:22.442 --> 01:22:23.442
Hey, that was really nice
of your parents

01:22:23.443 --> 01:22:25.444
to suspend your grounding
for the pool party.

01:22:25.445 --> 01:22:27.446
Yeah, Yeah,
they're good like that.

01:22:27.447 --> 01:22:29.449
Listen, I...

01:22:31.411 --> 01:22:32.451
I wanna thank you
for what you did,

01:22:32.452 --> 01:22:34.453
everything you went through.

01:22:34.454 --> 01:22:36.455
You're a better man than I.

01:22:36.456 --> 01:22:40.460
Glenn, could you say that
one more time for me, please?

01:22:41.461 --> 01:22:44.423
You are a better man than I.

01:22:44.424 --> 01:22:47.466
You have no idea
how good it feels,

01:22:47.467 --> 01:22:49.468
to hear you say that to me.

01:22:49.469 --> 01:22:51.470
I'm just glad I could help
you out with your dream.

01:22:51.471 --> 01:22:53.473
I know you helped me with mine.

01:22:54.474 --> 01:22:56.185
Oh!

01:22:56.186 --> 01:22:57.476
Togo's my lab partner
in clown college.

01:22:57.477 --> 01:23:00.479
Guy is a <i> genius</i> with seltzer.

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:02.481
( Honk honk )

01:23:02.482 --> 01:23:03.483
Classic Togo.

01:23:05.485 --> 01:23:08.487
I'm sorry if this is
a stupid question, but...

01:23:08.488 --> 01:23:10.489
- Where's your wife?
- What's that now?

01:23:10.490 --> 01:23:11.490
Karen?

01:23:11.491 --> 01:23:14.453
The woman that we chased
halfway across the state.

01:23:14.454 --> 01:23:15.494
Epic Adventures Karen?

01:23:15.495 --> 01:23:18.497
Oh, yeah, it didn't work out.

01:23:18.498 --> 01:23:19.498
GLENN: She was right, no spark.

01:23:19.499 --> 01:23:21.500
So, we parted ways.

01:23:21.501 --> 01:23:23.502
But, our little quest
sure got my fire going.

01:23:23.503 --> 01:23:26.923
I re-enrolled in North Dakota
Central State Clown College

01:23:26.924 --> 01:23:28.507
last night.

01:23:28.508 --> 01:23:31.511
You were so good
at your old job.

01:23:32.512 --> 01:23:34.513
To be honest with you,

01:23:34.514 --> 01:23:36.225
I was just coasting.

01:23:36.226 --> 01:23:37.516
Would you believe

01:23:37.517 --> 01:23:39.519
I passed over ninety-two
percent of my testees?

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:42.815
Ninety-two percent.

01:23:45.525 --> 01:23:47.237
( Rap music playing )

01:23:49.530 --> 01:23:50.823

So, I vault over the wall,

01:24:15.098 --> 01:24:18.100
mimic the wing span
of a common fruit bat,

01:24:18.101 --> 01:24:20.559
and, much like said fruit bat,

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:21.560
I achieved flight.

01:24:21.561 --> 01:24:23.397
- That's amazing.
- Yeah.

01:24:23.398 --> 01:24:25.564
That was some flight,
fruit bat.

01:24:25.565 --> 01:24:28.861
RUSSELL: My journey through the
sewer was far more dangerous.

01:24:34.574 --> 01:24:36.575
Don't you just wanna
put him in your pocket?

01:24:36.576 --> 01:24:38.577
He's hilarious.

01:24:38.578 --> 01:24:41.580
I'm happy we decided
to keep things small.

01:24:41.581 --> 01:24:43.582
Oh, no, you didn't.

01:24:43.583 --> 01:24:45.585
Oh, settle down, girlfriend.

01:24:46.587 --> 01:24:47.588
Come on.

01:24:52.592 --> 01:24:56.595
You know, I'm really glad we decided
to come to this party together.

01:24:56.596 --> 01:24:58.890
Yeah, well, I'm really glad
I got my license.

01:24:58.891 --> 01:25:02.144
I would have come with you even
if your mom had to drive.

01:25:02.145 --> 01:25:04.603
I was just looking for an
excuse to hang out with you.

Thanks so much
for getting my vanilla.

01:25:31.631 --> 01:25:33.632
You're welcome.

01:25:33.633 --> 01:25:35.634
Did I tell you that
I'd to buy these twice?

01:25:35.635 --> 01:25:37.636
Some crazy man in his underwear

01:25:37.637 --> 01:25:39.638
ruined the first box.

01:25:39.639 --> 01:25:41.641
He actually kinda looks
like that clown over there.

01:25:42.642 --> 01:25:43.643
Hey there, little fellow.

01:25:49.649 --> 01:25:52.651
Enjoy your poodle.

01:25:52.652 --> 01:25:53.946
( Squeak squeak )

01:25:59.659 --> 01:26:01.496
I'm sure that's
just a coincidence.
