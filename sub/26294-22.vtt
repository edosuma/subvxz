WEBVTT

00:00.413 --> 00:03.979
Olivia said Casey and I
were meant for each other.

00:04.003 --> 00:06.171
How do you feel about Casey?

00:06.173 --> 00:08.206
That's the thing. I-I don't know.

00:08.208 --> 00:09.975
When I told you to leave Hubble alone,

00:09.977 --> 00:10.917
that wasn't a suggestion.

00:10.919 --> 00:13.144
That was an order.
And you went over there anyway?

00:13.146 --> 00:14.285
I was supposed to sit on my hands

00:14.287 --> 00:15.597
when I have knowledge that could help?

00:15.599 --> 00:17.849
He's not letting this thing go, is he?

00:17.851 --> 00:19.551
Maybe you should reach out to him.

00:19.553 --> 00:22.287
I have a feeling you're
the onhe needs right now.

00:22.289 --> 00:24.620
I'm Lieutenant Kelly Severide
with the CFD.

00:24.621 --> 00:26.121
Are you related to Benny Severide?

00:26.123 --> 00:28.127
Carol Spears is the arsonist.

00:28.892 --> 00:31.703
She's in it for the chaos.
Someone's gonna get killed.

00:31.705 --> 00:34.643
So whatever we do, we better move fast.

00:42.172 --> 00:44.278
You're still working
on the arsonist case?

00:45.409 --> 00:47.030
Carol Spears.

00:47.544 --> 00:49.324
She's in the wind. No sign of her.

00:50.013 --> 00:51.813
CPD is involved?

00:51.815 --> 00:54.015
Intelligence unit is
in the middle of something.

00:54.017 --> 00:57.652
Voight said to sit tight
and trust the process.

01:01.420 --> 01:02.924
This is the last thing I thought

01:02.926 --> 01:04.548
would come out of my mouth, but...

01:04.941 --> 01:06.592
I wish Benny were here.

01:07.497 --> 01:08.930
He'd chew up some ass over at CPD

01:08.932 --> 01:10.598
to have half the department
in the streets

01:10.600 --> 01:11.889
looking for this lady.

01:14.271 --> 01:18.540
Well, I am not half
the department, but I'm in.

01:20.077 --> 01:21.161
What are we looking for?

01:21.163 --> 01:22.281
No, you don't have to do that, please.

01:22.283 --> 01:24.109
I'm helping you. End of story.

01:26.983 --> 01:28.449
Fine.

01:28.474 --> 01:30.240
You better watch out, Herrmann.

01:30.265 --> 01:31.765
Once I get good rolling these hoses,

01:31.790 --> 01:34.791
I might join Engine 51.
Start putting out some fires.

01:34.816 --> 01:36.626
Anytime you want to take Clarence's spot,

01:36.670 --> 01:38.126
you let me know.

01:38.128 --> 01:39.416
He doesn't mean that.

01:39.896 --> 01:42.294
Hey, Capp. Your shirt's on backwards.

01:42.986 --> 01:44.418
Thanks.

01:44.443 --> 01:46.110
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Ritter!

01:46.135 --> 01:47.155
What?

01:47.180 --> 01:48.887
You just had an absolutely perfect

01:48.912 --> 01:50.717
ball busting opportunity

01:50.741 --> 01:52.640
and you kicked it all
the way to Wisconsin.

01:52.642 --> 01:55.744
Are you telling me that
Capp did something so stupid

01:55.746 --> 01:58.713
as to put his shirt on backwards,

01:58.715 --> 02:00.648
and you don't light him up?

02:00.650 --> 02:01.716
Is there something wrong with you?

02:01.718 --> 02:03.785
Mouch, help me out here.

02:03.787 --> 02:07.055
Yeah, the situation demands insults.

02:07.057 --> 02:10.558
You can't let Capp off the hook
just because you're friends.

02:10.560 --> 02:12.647
Yeah, but you got mad when I was...

02:13.463 --> 02:15.298
Whoa!

02:16.827 --> 02:23.097
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

02:28.348 --> 02:30.475
My... my mom's about to have a baby!

02:31.878 --> 02:34.044
She said drive to the fire station.

02:34.046 --> 02:36.747
You did good. You did good.

02:36.749 --> 02:38.749
- What's your name?
- Cory.

02:38.751 --> 02:39.917
You hurt, Cory?

02:39.919 --> 02:41.218
Mmm! My head!

02:41.220 --> 02:42.720
- Jump bag.
- Yeah.

02:42.722 --> 02:43.988
This baby's coming.

02:43.990 --> 02:46.157
Turn toward me, honey. Let me see.

02:47.560 --> 02:48.726
Yeah, it is.

02:48.728 --> 02:50.161
Uh, Foster, grab me the OB kit.

02:50.163 --> 02:51.196
On it!

02:52.165 --> 02:54.365
Mom!

02:54.367 --> 02:57.168
Uh, she's good, Cory.
It hurts to have a baby.

02:57.170 --> 02:59.870
Listen, we're gonna put
a bandage on that cut, okay?

02:59.872 --> 03:03.274
You did good. You did so good, baby.

03:06.835 --> 03:08.712
All right, your contractions
are right on top of each other.

03:08.714 --> 03:10.114
What's your name, mama?

03:10.116 --> 03:11.882
- Daria.
- Okay, Daria.

03:11.884 --> 03:13.684
Next time I'm gonna
need you to push, okay?

03:13.686 --> 03:15.519
Push, push.

03:15.521 --> 03:18.022
How we looking? Hey, how's it going?

03:18.024 --> 03:19.790
Uh, you can see its head.

03:21.461 --> 03:23.194
Jump out.

03:23.196 --> 03:24.895
I've seen a lot of grown men and women

03:24.897 --> 03:26.964
do a lot of great things, Cory.

03:26.966 --> 03:28.432
You driving this car up here

03:28.434 --> 03:30.601
so your mom can deliver
your baby brother?

03:30.603 --> 03:32.703
It's top of the list.

03:32.705 --> 03:34.305
Baby sister.

03:34.307 --> 03:36.574
Baby sister.

03:36.576 --> 03:37.975
Just wait here.

03:37.977 --> 03:40.744
All right. Push, push, push.

03:43.783 --> 03:45.082
Keep going.

03:45.084 --> 03:48.552
- Okay. Okay.
- She's doing good.

03:49.989 --> 03:51.622
Look at you!

03:51.624 --> 03:53.457
You did it, Daria.

03:53.459 --> 03:56.494
Oh, it's my baby!

03:56.496 --> 03:59.430
Oh! There's my baby.

04:04.670 --> 04:06.837
See your sister there?

04:06.839 --> 04:08.815
You're a big reason she's here.

04:10.009 --> 04:11.408
Mommy and baby are looking good.

04:11.410 --> 04:12.676
Let's get her to Lakeshore, guys.

04:12.678 --> 04:14.005
- Yeah.
- Copy that.

04:14.007 --> 04:17.680
Hey, have you ever ridden
in a fire truck, Cory?

04:17.683 --> 04:19.184
No.

04:19.185 --> 04:22.319
Well, let's say we follow the
ambulance over to the hospital

04:22.321 --> 04:24.321
and you ride up front with me, huh?

04:24.323 --> 04:25.789
We'll get your mom and baby sister

04:25.791 --> 04:27.334
to the hospital safe, okay?

04:27.927 --> 04:29.693
- All aboard, 81.
- Let's go.

04:29.695 --> 04:31.088
I'll go grab Kidd.

04:32.339 --> 04:33.697
All right, jump up.

04:35.968 --> 04:38.836
Got your belt on?

04:43.376 --> 04:44.582
Who needs coffee?

04:44.584 --> 04:46.377
That was the best morning
pick me up ever.

04:46.379 --> 04:48.345
I'll go give Boden a heads up.

04:48.347 --> 04:51.691
See about getting a tow truck
out here for the station wagon.

04:52.567 --> 04:54.806
Yo, Ritter, I've been thinking.

04:54.808 --> 04:57.821
- Here we go.
- Yeah. Hey, Ritter.

04:57.823 --> 05:01.225
You know, as we were watching
that beautiful baby

05:01.227 --> 05:03.160
take her first breath this morning,

05:03.162 --> 05:05.229
it dawned on me

05:05.231 --> 05:08.632
that it is part of my job to teach you,

05:08.634 --> 05:11.869
like that baby, the ways of the world.

05:11.871 --> 05:17.541
And by that, I mean how to
properly bust somebody's balls.

05:19.103 --> 05:20.447
- Mm-mm.
- No, no, no.

05:20.449 --> 05:22.212
Don't shake your head, all right?

05:22.214 --> 05:24.315
It is as important to a firefighter

05:24.317 --> 05:27.418
as learning how to use an axe
or spray a hose.

05:27.420 --> 05:31.822
It is an art form that
requires a deft touch.

05:31.824 --> 05:33.223
And we?

05:33.225 --> 05:34.925
We're gonna have our
first lesson in earnest

05:34.927 --> 05:37.561
as soon as Truck 81 gets back here.

05:39.532 --> 05:41.632
Yay!

05:46.539 --> 05:48.405
Feeling okay?

05:49.375 --> 05:50.774
Hey, you don't have to stay with him.

05:50.776 --> 05:52.576
We can hang out with Cory
until his dad gets here.

05:52.578 --> 05:55.137
Cory, what happened? Where's your mom?

05:55.139 --> 05:56.714
- How are you?
- Are you mad?

05:56.716 --> 05:57.781
What?

05:57.783 --> 05:59.283
No. No, son.

05:59.285 --> 06:01.285
Your son drove his mom
right up to the firehouse

06:01.287 --> 06:02.953
where he knew there were
a lot of men and women

06:02.955 --> 06:04.288
ready to help.

06:04.290 --> 06:05.891
I've never seen anything like it.

06:06.626 --> 06:08.226
You did that?

06:09.128 --> 06:11.095
Where'd you learn to drive a car?

06:11.097 --> 06:12.429
Xbox.

06:14.033 --> 06:15.466
Thank you.

06:15.468 --> 06:16.693
Of course.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.637
- Mr. Crowell?
- Yes?

06:19.639 --> 06:21.905
Would you like to go meet
your baby daughter?

06:21.907 --> 06:23.405
More than anything.

06:27.601 --> 06:30.658
Well, I'm gonna take
the truck back to the firehouse

06:30.660 --> 06:32.316
before there's any more excitement.

06:32.667 --> 06:34.669
You were really good with that boy.

06:35.287 --> 06:37.154
Just doing my job.

06:42.128 --> 06:44.328
- What?
- Jump him already.

06:44.330 --> 06:45.996
Look at your face.

06:45.998 --> 06:48.132
Oh, my God, you're as easy
to read as "The Hunger Games."

06:48.134 --> 06:50.634
Just jump him already
and get it over with.

06:50.636 --> 06:52.936
What if he doesn't want me to jump him?

06:52.938 --> 06:55.606
Have you seen yourself?
You're a freaking 11.

06:55.608 --> 06:57.074
Who wouldn't want you to jump them?

06:57.076 --> 06:59.194
Hell, I want you to jump me.

07:01.681 --> 07:03.914
- Hey, I'm back.
- Hey.

07:03.916 --> 07:05.483
- Take a look.
- All right.

07:05.485 --> 07:07.251
Hubble said that while Carol Spears

07:07.253 --> 07:09.586
was married to this guy, uh, Doug Denton,

07:09.588 --> 07:12.281
he must've helped her control
her compulsion,

07:12.283 --> 07:14.414
even if he didn't know anything
about her starting fires.

07:14.416 --> 07:16.527
OFI ran into this place
yesterday to talk to Denton,

07:16.529 --> 07:18.495
but he wasn't very helpful.

07:18.497 --> 07:20.097
I mean, he was cooperative,

07:20.099 --> 07:21.865
but he's still bitter about the divorce.

07:21.867 --> 07:24.803
Hasn't seen her since she left.
Wants nothing to do with her.

07:28.848 --> 07:30.274
I'll bet you a box of Cracker Jacks

07:30.276 --> 07:32.309
this guy knows more than he's letting on.

07:32.644 --> 07:34.378
I mean, he knew her best.

07:34.688 --> 07:36.280
He'd know where she would hole up

07:36.282 --> 07:38.615
or what her most likely targets are.

07:39.192 --> 07:42.519
Yeah, but OFI said they were stalemated.

07:43.279 --> 07:46.457
I don't know what
Hubble's personal situation is,

07:46.459 --> 07:49.660
but, you know,
maybe I'd be better qualified

07:49.662 --> 07:51.962
to talk to somebody about
a rough relationship

07:51.964 --> 07:53.581
with an ex-spouse.

07:55.401 --> 07:57.401
Capp said you were looking for me, Chief?

07:57.403 --> 07:59.203
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on in.

07:59.205 --> 08:00.904
Do I need to shut the door?

08:00.906 --> 08:02.973
Oh, no, no, no. It's nothing like that.

08:02.975 --> 08:05.576
Um, my lovely wife

08:05.578 --> 08:09.012
thought it'd be a good idea
to outbid the Hildebrants

08:09.014 --> 08:10.247
at Terrence's school auction.

08:10.249 --> 08:12.182
Uh-oh. What'd you win?

08:12.184 --> 08:13.717
Dinner for four at the Palm next Friday.

08:13.719 --> 08:16.386
- Ooh, swanky.
- Tell me about it.

08:16.388 --> 08:18.589
Anyway, Donna says I have
to invite someone

08:18.591 --> 08:21.225
besides Mouch and Herrmann
to come join us.

08:21.227 --> 08:25.262
So grab yourself a plus-one.
Join us for dinner.

08:25.264 --> 08:27.064
Sounds like I need to find a date.

08:27.066 --> 08:28.532
Sounds like you do.

08:28.534 --> 08:31.335
All right, Chief.
Let's see what I can do.

08:32.630 --> 08:34.664
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

08:36.000 --> 08:42.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:56.462 --> 09:00.130
T-O-P-I-C-S.

09:00.132 --> 09:01.799
Okay.

09:01.801 --> 09:04.768
It would behooves us to start
with the basics, right?

09:04.770 --> 09:08.639
What you can and cannot
attack somebody for.

09:08.641 --> 09:12.911
So, here in the
acceptable column, we have...

09:13.912 --> 09:15.813
what are these people wearing?

09:16.416 --> 09:19.049
What are they eating?
What are they saying?

09:19.051 --> 09:21.251
What kind of hair do they have?

09:21.253 --> 09:23.987
Uh, maybe they got
a new blemish or a mole.

09:23.989 --> 09:25.956
I could go on and on.

09:25.958 --> 09:27.791
But this is important.

09:27.793 --> 09:31.562
What is not acceptable to attack?

09:36.601 --> 09:38.103
There's only one.

09:38.571 --> 09:40.103
Age.

09:40.105 --> 09:41.805
What? Hey, no. And race.

09:41.807 --> 09:44.508
And sexual preference. And, uh, gender.

09:44.510 --> 09:47.010
And disabilities and religion.

09:47.012 --> 09:48.812
Some of those sure, but...

09:48.814 --> 09:50.832
Age is the key one.

09:50.834 --> 09:52.282
No, it is not.

09:52.284 --> 09:53.684
All right, you know what?

09:53.686 --> 09:55.452
We're gonna have to do a practice case.

09:55.454 --> 09:58.755
It's like when we drill
with those rescue dummies?

09:58.757 --> 10:00.524
Okay?

10:03.929 --> 10:05.462
Hey, my brother!

10:05.464 --> 10:08.599
Wanna listen to some bitching Van Halen?

10:08.601 --> 10:09.833
Okay.

10:09.835 --> 10:12.803
So how many opportunities
do you see here?

10:14.106 --> 10:18.041
Squad 3, Engine 51,
car fire, 422 W. California.

10:18.043 --> 10:21.445
Okay. To be continued.

10:35.127 --> 10:37.194
Herrmann, someone's in there!

10:44.670 --> 10:47.504
Herrmann, hit it!

10:47.506 --> 10:49.306
- Send water!
- Copy that.

10:52.745 --> 10:54.144
Back me up!

11:07.026 --> 11:08.926
God damn it.

11:12.364 --> 11:16.266
Whoa, Severide. Look at that.

11:16.268 --> 11:17.391
Gas can.

11:17.393 --> 11:20.270
This girl or guy turned
their car into an oven.

11:23.776 --> 11:25.242
What's up, boss?

11:25.244 --> 11:27.629
The arsonist we've been after?

11:29.088 --> 11:33.183
That's the donut shop where she
told Benny she was a victim.

11:37.523 --> 11:39.923
And this is her car.

11:47.144 --> 11:49.111
- Captain Hubble, please?
- Hey.

11:52.550 --> 11:54.283
Hey, listen. It's Severide.

11:54.285 --> 11:55.651
There's a victim from a car fire

11:55.653 --> 11:57.453
headed to the morgue at Cook County.

11:57.455 --> 11:58.954
It was a car found
in front of Donut Heaven

11:58.956 --> 12:00.956
where Carol Spears
first claimed to be a victim.

12:00.958 --> 12:03.425
The car is just like the one she owned.

12:03.427 --> 12:06.462
But, listen, I don't think
it's her body inside.

12:08.332 --> 12:10.566
I'm telling you check the dental records.

12:10.568 --> 12:12.168
It doesn't fit for her
to go out like this.

12:12.170 --> 12:13.502
Not after 15 years,

12:13.504 --> 12:16.005
not after toying with
my father for so long.

12:16.260 --> 12:17.606
I will.

12:20.178 --> 12:21.310
Wanna keep working?

12:21.312 --> 12:22.684
Yeah.

12:26.951 --> 12:28.439
Brett.

12:29.649 --> 12:30.942
Yeah.

12:31.455 --> 12:33.022
So, uh, I...

12:33.024 --> 12:35.191
It's not that you're bad
at, you know, coming up

12:35.193 --> 12:36.458
with clever things to say.

12:36.460 --> 12:38.194
Although that might be part of it.

12:38.196 --> 12:39.762
It's just that I think

12:39.764 --> 12:42.364
you just don't want to hurt
anybody's feelings.

12:42.979 --> 12:44.057
Exactly.

12:44.059 --> 12:45.367
You didn't become a firefighter

12:45.369 --> 12:47.333
to worry about feelings.

12:48.439 --> 12:51.064
Oh. Perfect!

12:51.066 --> 12:52.734
- What?
- Insult Brett.

12:52.736 --> 12:54.343
No, I'm not gonna insult Brett.

12:54.345 --> 12:55.844
Oh, sure you are.

12:55.846 --> 12:58.280
Listen, nobody is safe
in a firehouse, all right?

12:58.282 --> 13:00.555
Even someone as sweet as Sylvie.

13:01.556 --> 13:02.851
What would I even insult her about?

13:02.853 --> 13:04.453
I don't know. Let's think about it.

13:04.455 --> 13:06.322
Uh, it's her turn to make lunch.

13:06.324 --> 13:07.790
It's not me. We're all hungry.

13:07.792 --> 13:10.392
- Right, Captain?
- Leave me out of this.

13:10.719 --> 13:12.219
He's hungry. We're all hungry.

13:12.221 --> 13:14.288
So go ahead. Insult her for the lunch.

13:14.290 --> 13:16.654
Okay. Um...

13:17.793 --> 13:19.626
how about...

13:19.628 --> 13:21.228
hey, Brett?

13:21.230 --> 13:24.064
My mom always told me never
to trust a skinny cook.

13:24.066 --> 13:26.166
So you should not be making lunch.

13:26.168 --> 13:29.236
Aww, you think I look skinny?

13:29.238 --> 13:32.639
Excuse me. You body shaming Brett?

13:32.641 --> 13:34.408
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

13:34.410 --> 13:35.676
I-I-I-I wouldn't...

13:35.678 --> 13:37.477
It kind of sounds like you were.

13:39.279 --> 13:40.720
Uh...

13:42.251 --> 13:44.318
All right, advanced lesson number one.

13:44.320 --> 13:47.477
Don't attack the lamb when
a shepherd's still around.

13:50.159 --> 13:53.316
Um, what did you want to ask me?

13:54.196 --> 13:56.363
Uh...

13:56.365 --> 13:58.398
you know what?

13:58.400 --> 13:59.947
Let me get back to you.

14:11.113 --> 14:13.795
Hey if you wanna call it a
night and get some shut-eye...

14:14.617 --> 14:16.214
I'm good.

14:19.388 --> 14:22.386
You've been staring at
that same page for an hour.

14:22.958 --> 14:25.592
I just don't wanna miss some details.

14:29.852 --> 14:35.469
But the last time you had
that same look in your eye

14:35.471 --> 14:37.777
was after Benny died

14:38.540 --> 14:41.823
and we went to hell.

14:43.412 --> 14:45.078
You were tired then.

14:45.743 --> 14:47.787
Trying to do too much.

14:48.817 --> 14:50.784
And I don't like it.

14:54.957 --> 14:57.203
No one else is gonna catch this woman.

15:16.779 --> 15:18.266
Hey, this is Kelly.

15:24.253 --> 15:27.326
Are you gonna call CPD?
This is an escalation.

15:28.290 --> 15:30.691
Okay, yeah. That's what I figured.

15:31.038 --> 15:32.456
I will.

15:34.530 --> 15:36.029
Body wasn't Carol's.

15:38.033 --> 15:39.839
It was a homeless woman

15:40.965 --> 15:45.205
with a history of drug abuse
and mental health issues.

15:45.207 --> 15:47.507
Carol must've lured her to the car,

15:47.509 --> 15:50.777
let her shoot up, lit the fuse.

15:51.267 --> 15:52.713
God.

15:55.746 --> 15:59.119
You're right.
No one's moving fast enough on this.

16:00.723 --> 16:04.124
As soon as shift is over,
we go to see the ex.

16:15.738 --> 16:17.237
Doug?

16:17.239 --> 16:19.139
I'm Kelly Severide. This is Stella Kidd.

16:19.141 --> 16:20.707
We're with the Chicago Fire Department.

16:20.709 --> 16:22.209
- Fire?
- Yes.

16:22.211 --> 16:23.977
Can we ask you some questions?

16:23.979 --> 16:25.545
I just talked to the police department

16:25.547 --> 16:28.531
and some woman from the arson department

16:28.533 --> 16:29.649
or whatever it's called.

16:29.651 --> 16:32.058
The Office of Fire Investigation, yeah.

16:32.921 --> 16:34.354
I don't know what else I can tell you.

16:34.356 --> 16:37.090
No, we completely understand.

16:37.092 --> 16:39.659
But we were thinking
we can maybe come inside

16:39.661 --> 16:41.695
and talk more casually.

16:47.102 --> 16:49.035
I don't know what you want to know.

16:49.037 --> 16:51.605
Carol and I were oil and water,

16:51.607 --> 16:53.829
and we never should've gotten
married in the first place.

16:53.831 --> 16:57.744
But my dad had just died and, uh...

16:57.746 --> 17:01.915
I was in a dark place when she found me.

17:01.917 --> 17:04.184
But you were married 15 years.

17:04.185 --> 17:06.300
Well, it was fine at first.

17:07.222 --> 17:10.589
And... and we didn't fight.
It wasn't like that.

17:10.592 --> 17:14.560
It was just like a-a gradual erosion.

17:14.563 --> 17:18.165
You don't even realize your
marriage is falling apart.

17:18.867 --> 17:20.467
And then it's over.

17:20.469 --> 17:21.801
Who ended it?

17:21.804 --> 17:23.192
I left.

17:23.872 --> 17:25.194
Why?

17:25.874 --> 17:27.613
She said things.

17:29.244 --> 17:31.283
I loved her, but she...

17:32.447 --> 17:34.514
I just felt like
I didn't know her anymore.

17:36.652 --> 17:37.873
I...

17:39.087 --> 17:44.157
I was married to a man named Grant.

17:44.159 --> 17:46.426
He was bad news.

17:46.428 --> 17:48.328
He wasn't able to help himself,

17:48.330 --> 17:52.388
and so I spent all of
my energy trying to help him.

17:53.514 --> 17:55.602
When I kicked him out,

17:55.604 --> 17:58.305
he kept coming back to me
again and again.

17:58.307 --> 18:01.480
And every time,
worse than the time before.

18:01.910 --> 18:04.025
And I thought about it a lot.

18:05.192 --> 18:06.580
Why?

18:06.861 --> 18:12.285
Why wouldn't he just leave me alone?

18:14.118 --> 18:20.160
I realized that I was the only
person in his entire life

18:20.162 --> 18:21.959
that ever tried to make him better.

18:22.965 --> 18:24.764
And it drained me.

18:24.766 --> 18:28.507
Drained me until
I-I had nothing left to give.

18:30.038 --> 18:32.219
So I know where you're at, Doug.

18:33.888 --> 18:38.378
And that's why I know that
Carol will come back to you

18:38.380 --> 18:41.020
just like Grant came back to me.

18:43.518 --> 18:48.488
You are worth more than
this woman deserves.

18:48.490 --> 18:50.780
I can promise you that, Doug.

18:52.828 --> 18:54.909
So when she comes back,

18:55.397 --> 18:59.332
we need you to contact us.

19:01.832 --> 19:05.252
Because she's hurting other people, Doug.

19:05.908 --> 19:07.382
She is.

19:12.047 --> 19:17.183
We need to find Carol so that
she doesn't hurt anyone else.

19:26.561 --> 19:28.094
Doug.

19:31.833 --> 19:33.099
Is she here?

19:43.245 --> 19:44.844
Carol?

20:00.645 --> 20:02.144
Carol!

20:09.721 --> 20:11.277
Hey!

20:12.724 --> 20:15.157
Get off me, you bastard!

20:17.928 --> 20:19.495
You good?

20:19.497 --> 20:21.163
Oh.

20:21.165 --> 20:23.330
Hey! Okay.

20:23.835 --> 20:25.401
I'm so sorry.

20:25.403 --> 20:26.836
Help me, Doug.

20:26.838 --> 20:29.572
- Help me! They're hurting me!
- You need help.

20:29.574 --> 20:30.740
Carol, they're gonna get you help.

20:30.742 --> 20:32.923
Help me, Doug! Now!

20:34.078 --> 20:38.347
Doug, call 911. Now. Do it.

20:57.502 --> 20:58.960
It's just a scratch.

20:58.962 --> 21:00.607
- Be honest.
- It's nothing.

21:00.609 --> 21:02.271
If I'm gonna look like
Frankenstein's monster,

21:02.273 --> 21:03.439
I wanna know.

21:03.441 --> 21:05.289
Won't even need stitches.

21:05.810 --> 21:07.499
What'd I tell ya?

21:09.714 --> 21:11.378
You were great in there.

21:14.256 --> 21:16.952
Just trying to connect so he'd open up.

21:16.954 --> 21:18.954
Severide.

21:20.391 --> 21:21.722
Great work.

21:23.628 --> 21:25.394
I'm just glad it's over.

21:25.396 --> 21:26.829
You know, I'm not sure

21:26.831 --> 21:28.330
if anyone would've ever
been able to solve this

21:28.332 --> 21:29.365
if it wasn't for you.

21:29.367 --> 21:32.902
Ah. Thanks goes to Benny.

21:32.904 --> 21:34.303
Well, listen.

21:34.305 --> 21:36.405
Someday when you least expect it,

21:36.407 --> 21:39.448
I'm gonna convince you
to transfer over to OFI.

21:40.044 --> 21:43.654
You have a nose for it, Kelly.
Just like your father.

21:50.822 --> 21:52.488
- Hey!
- Hey, Herrmann.

21:52.490 --> 21:53.889
What are you drinking, Mayor?

21:53.891 --> 21:56.425
I'm gonna have a...
I'll have a shot of whiskey.

21:56.427 --> 21:57.693
You got it.

21:57.695 --> 21:59.662
So, hey, I don't know your secret

21:59.664 --> 22:02.164
but you look the same going out
as you did coming in.

22:02.166 --> 22:03.766
- Hey, Herrmann.
- Yeah.

22:03.768 --> 22:06.268
I've got a phrase up on
the fifth floor of City Hall.

22:06.270 --> 22:09.605
Never does a man stand so tall
as when he's on all fours

22:09.607 --> 22:11.073
kissing somebody else's butt.

22:11.075 --> 22:13.576
- So here's to standing tall.
- Hey.

22:13.578 --> 22:15.878
And to Chicago's police and firefighters.

22:15.880 --> 22:17.880
Their service on behalf

22:17.882 --> 22:19.448
of the most American of American cities.

22:19.450 --> 22:20.950
- There you go.
- Thanks, Herrmann.

22:20.952 --> 22:22.324
Absolutely.

22:23.721 --> 22:26.589
Hey, there she is!

22:26.591 --> 22:27.790
- Hey!
- Hey.

22:29.260 --> 22:31.126
Hey, we heard about you and Severide

22:31.128 --> 22:32.895
bringing down that arsonist.

22:32.897 --> 22:34.263
You get to drink free all night.

22:34.265 --> 22:36.932
I drink free every night, Herrmann.

22:36.934 --> 22:39.201
Well, Severide gets a drink half off.

22:40.204 --> 22:43.117
Where is Kelly?

22:43.119 --> 22:44.440
Uh, haven't seen him.

22:44.442 --> 22:46.242
But if you wanna slide me
one of them free drinks

22:46.244 --> 22:50.012
Herrmann was talking about,
I'd be much obliged.

22:53.150 --> 22:55.084
Oh, Chaplain, uh,
we are going to the bar.

22:55.086 --> 22:56.318
You want me to grab you something?

22:56.320 --> 22:58.554
- IPA.
- You got it.

22:59.658 --> 23:02.324
Are... are you here to pat
Stella on the back or...

23:02.326 --> 23:05.094
No, I'm... I'm here to see you.

23:05.096 --> 23:08.162
- Oh.
- I wanted to, uh...

23:09.500 --> 23:11.500
I have some important news to tell you.

23:11.502 --> 23:13.002
Sure. Of course.

23:14.639 --> 23:17.172
The National First Responder
and Peer Support Initiative

23:17.174 --> 23:20.409
has asked me to be their director.

23:21.341 --> 23:24.179
Really? That's a big deal.

23:24.181 --> 23:26.649
It is, it is.

23:26.651 --> 23:29.418
Oh, Kyle, that's wonderful.

23:32.957 --> 23:34.480
You're a superstar.

23:35.355 --> 23:37.067
Well, here's the bad news.

23:37.069 --> 23:38.358
Um...

23:38.596 --> 23:41.864
The headquarters are
outside of Indianapolis.

23:42.488 --> 23:45.868
They want me to move, like, yesterday.

23:45.870 --> 23:47.937
Oh, really?

23:47.939 --> 23:50.039
Do you think that's a-a bad idea?

23:50.041 --> 23:52.623
No, no. I mean...

23:53.778 --> 23:55.978
selfishly, I'm not happy about it.

23:55.980 --> 23:59.448
But I think they're
really lucky to have you.

24:01.285 --> 24:03.092
What is up, Chaplain?

24:04.188 --> 24:06.889
Kyle is moving to Indianapolis.

24:06.891 --> 24:09.458
- Um, A-Anderson, actually.
- Really?

24:09.460 --> 24:11.126
That's like 30 minutes
from where I grew up.

24:11.128 --> 24:13.228
- Really?
- You will love it.

24:13.230 --> 24:14.937
Great people in Anderson.

24:17.468 --> 24:19.835
The universe has really
conspired to keep us apart,

24:19.837 --> 24:21.151
hasn't it?

24:24.241 --> 24:26.909
You know, I-I'm gonna...
I'm gonna get going.

24:26.911 --> 24:28.477
It was good to see you, everybody.

24:28.479 --> 24:31.080
And thanks, this has... this has been...

24:31.082 --> 24:33.983
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

24:34.373 --> 24:37.653
Uh, be right back.

24:43.861 --> 24:46.228
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:46.760 --> 24:50.699
It's, uh, good to see
you back with the Chaplain.

24:50.701 --> 24:52.401
What? Uh, no, we're...

24:52.403 --> 24:56.672
I always liked him. With you, I mean.

24:57.020 --> 24:59.008
You guys are right for each other.

24:59.010 --> 25:02.211
Both nice, good, selfless people.

25:02.213 --> 25:04.113
You're good together.

25:16.794 --> 25:18.627
Can I get an Old Fashioned?

25:18.629 --> 25:20.043
You got it, Captain.

25:21.132 --> 25:23.298
Hey, you seen Kelly?

25:24.011 --> 25:25.715
- He came home.
- Mm-hmm?

25:25.717 --> 25:27.588
It's a little weird, actually.

25:27.590 --> 25:29.416
You know that notebook of Benny's

25:29.418 --> 25:30.471
he's been carrying around?

25:30.473 --> 25:31.563
Uh-huh.

25:31.565 --> 25:33.142
He just threw it on the couch and left.

25:33.144 --> 25:34.766
I thought maybe he came here.

25:35.446 --> 25:37.146
No.

25:42.119 --> 25:45.654
Herrmann, I'm gonna need
the rest of the night off.

25:45.656 --> 25:46.989
What?

25:46.991 --> 25:48.791
Your shift just started.

26:33.537 --> 26:36.205
You deserve a better man than me.

26:40.878 --> 26:42.625
So I decided...

26:46.650 --> 26:49.543
I decided I'm gonna be
the man you deserve.

27:49.099 --> 27:50.933
Morning.

27:56.240 --> 27:57.839
How's it going?

27:57.841 --> 28:01.843
Mmm. It's pretty perfect.

28:04.207 --> 28:06.348
How are we doing on time?

28:06.626 --> 28:09.284
Uh, we should shower up, hit the road.

28:09.286 --> 28:10.786
Okay.

28:15.969 --> 28:19.261
You decided to get
this place ready to sell?

28:20.724 --> 28:22.142
I'm gonna keep it.

28:23.185 --> 28:24.933
Fix it up. Make it worthy.

28:30.674 --> 28:33.208
Um...

28:36.046 --> 28:38.213
Which way is the shower?

28:40.784 --> 28:43.385
Yeah, no. I mean you should show me.

28:43.387 --> 28:45.721
Oh.

28:48.821 --> 28:50.320
Morning, glories!

28:50.322 --> 28:52.122
Boden pushed the briefing
back half an hour.

28:52.124 --> 28:53.223
He's on a phone call.

28:53.225 --> 28:54.558
- Perfect!
- Yes!

28:54.560 --> 28:56.093
That means we are officially not late.

28:56.095 --> 28:58.962
Sylvie! Sylvie, hey.

28:58.964 --> 29:00.163
I'm glad I caught you.

29:00.165 --> 29:01.665
I wanted to talk to you before shift.

29:01.667 --> 29:03.066
Um, I drove to your apartment,

29:03.068 --> 29:04.501
but you were already
on the road, I guess.

29:04.503 --> 29:06.169
Um, yeah.
We're... we're bells up at 8:00.

29:06.171 --> 29:08.572
Yeah, look, uh, I was
thinking about this all night.

29:08.574 --> 29:11.275
I don't want to make
a big scene, but, um...

29:11.277 --> 29:12.976
I spent five months in that hospital bed

29:12.978 --> 29:15.312
and I swore I would make
the most out of every second

29:15.314 --> 29:16.580
if I got through that alive.

29:16.582 --> 29:18.815
- Oh, Kyle...
- And then you showed up

29:18.817 --> 29:21.018
and... and I couldn't see
what was right in front of me.

29:21.020 --> 29:23.353
- I... I don't...
- I love you, Sylvie.

29:23.355 --> 29:25.989
Your smile changes the temperature

29:25.991 --> 29:28.025
in whatever room you walk into.

29:28.027 --> 29:30.861
You have such a-a brightness.

29:30.863 --> 29:32.529
Such a radiance, such a goodness

29:32.531 --> 29:35.365
that... that I would be
the biggest fool on Earth

29:35.367 --> 29:37.601
if I let you get away from me.

29:44.677 --> 29:47.110
I'm leaving for Indiana tomorrow.

29:47.112 --> 29:49.146
And I am begging you to come with me.

29:50.683 --> 29:52.315
Sylvie Brett...

29:53.686 --> 29:55.286
will you marry me?

30:06.131 --> 30:07.964
- Yes.
- Yes? Yes?

30:07.966 --> 30:09.866
- Yes.
- You said yes, right?

30:09.868 --> 30:11.868
- Yes.
- Oh, my gosh!

30:13.238 --> 30:14.705
Oh, my God!

30:17.743 --> 30:19.309
Um, care to share?

30:19.311 --> 30:21.378
What's up?

30:21.380 --> 30:24.614
I think the chaplain just
asked Sylvie to marry him.

30:25.684 --> 30:27.584
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

30:27.586 --> 30:29.720
My God!

30:34.093 --> 30:35.692
Hey.

30:38.263 --> 30:40.097
Congratulations.

30:40.099 --> 30:41.781
I just, um...

30:42.768 --> 30:45.769
It's... it's what you said
to me, actually.

30:45.771 --> 30:48.438
You said that Kyle and I
are right for each other

30:48.440 --> 30:53.443
and I really thought
about that all night.

30:53.445 --> 30:55.946
And then he showed up here.

30:59.585 --> 31:03.086
Well, I'm... I'm happy for you.

31:05.891 --> 31:07.406
Thanks, Matt.

31:12.731 --> 31:14.464
Excuse me.

31:14.466 --> 31:17.033
Whoa, whoa, Chief!

31:17.035 --> 31:19.469
I didn't mean to come between
you and breakfast.

31:19.471 --> 31:22.038
I mean, it looks like
you need the jaws of life

31:22.040 --> 31:24.141
to help you fit into
that white shirt these days,

31:24.143 --> 31:25.728
am I right?

31:28.647 --> 31:30.247
Ritter.

31:31.150 --> 31:35.986
Never, ever ball bust
your Battalion Chief.

31:40.426 --> 31:44.895
Truck 81, Squad 3,
Engine 51, Ambulance 61,

31:44.897 --> 31:46.563
factory fire, 474 N. Racine.

31:46.565 --> 31:48.799
Hmm.

31:53.972 --> 31:55.839
- Oh, man.
- What?

31:55.841 --> 31:57.574
Three worst fires.

31:57.576 --> 32:01.011
Lumber yard, tire factory, and this one.

32:01.013 --> 32:02.446
Mattress factory.

32:02.448 --> 32:05.081
Put your chin strap on, kid.

32:05.083 --> 32:07.083
We're gonna take a beating.

32:16.161 --> 32:18.161
Hey, what's going on?

32:18.163 --> 32:19.362
Fire started in the basement.

32:19.364 --> 32:20.597
We got a ton of overstock down there

32:20.599 --> 32:22.265
and about 50 doing inventory.

32:22.267 --> 32:23.867
- Fifty men?
- Yeah.

32:23.869 --> 32:25.435
In the basement?

32:25.437 --> 32:26.870
Okay, men, you heard him.

32:26.872 --> 32:29.339
We got mattresses and we got a basement.

32:29.341 --> 32:30.874
Okay, squad, Truck,

32:30.876 --> 32:32.776
get down and get as
many people out as you can.

32:32.778 --> 32:34.511
- Copy.
- Engine drop two lines.

32:34.513 --> 32:37.380
Paramedics, start setting up
triage right there.

32:37.382 --> 32:38.482
- Copy that.
- Let's go, move it.

32:38.484 --> 32:40.450
Battalion 25 to Main,

32:40.452 --> 32:43.687
I need a 2-11 Alarm and an EMS Plan One

32:43.689 --> 32:47.557
at the Arnow Mattress Factory
on North Racine.

32:47.559 --> 32:49.960
The emergency stairwell is this way.

33:02.307 --> 33:04.140
Hey, we need another entrance.

33:04.142 --> 33:05.408
Oh, man.

33:05.410 --> 33:06.910
Get him out of here!

33:08.914 --> 33:11.748
Hey, Chief, we're at
the top of the stairwell

33:11.750 --> 33:12.916
but it's cooking!

33:12.918 --> 33:14.021
We need another way down!

33:14.023 --> 33:15.307
Here!

33:19.157 --> 33:20.924
All right. Okay.

33:20.926 --> 33:23.093
It looks like there's a service elevator

33:23.095 --> 33:24.661
in the Charlie-Delta corner.

33:24.663 --> 33:27.097
- Let's go.
- The top of the stairs.

33:27.099 --> 33:28.765
Copy!

33:35.107 --> 33:37.207
Otis! Get this elevator above us.

33:37.209 --> 33:38.275
Copy!

33:38.277 --> 33:40.043
Everyone, mask up.

33:46.184 --> 33:48.176
- Capp.
- Copy.

33:51.790 --> 33:54.524
- Johnny, rope bag!
- Lieutenant.

34:05.470 --> 34:08.271
- Capp!
- Coming in.

34:09.373 --> 34:11.440
- Hold this.
- Yeah.

34:21.053 --> 34:23.053
Doherty, charge the line.

34:30.262 --> 34:32.996
All right, feed it down!

34:35.667 --> 34:37.559
- You good?
- Yeah.

34:38.070 --> 34:40.562
Let's get this door open.

34:42.139 --> 34:44.674
One, two, three!

34:44.676 --> 34:48.678
Easy, easy.

34:48.679 --> 34:50.746
Slowly, slowly. Hey, wait, wait!

34:53.136 --> 34:55.804
Come on, this way.

34:55.829 --> 34:58.697
- Toward the elevator.
- Over here!

34:58.699 --> 35:00.799
This way!

35:04.205 --> 35:06.438
- Coming through.
- I got you.

35:06.440 --> 35:09.492
Truck 64, get a ladder down
that elevator shaft.

35:09.519 --> 35:12.353
Trucks 66 and 43, primary search.

35:12.355 --> 35:16.290
Ambulances 74 and 97,
assist 61 with triage.

35:16.292 --> 35:18.292
Engine 12, engine 25,

35:18.294 --> 35:21.462
I need hose lines attacking the
stairwells on the Alpha side.

35:21.464 --> 35:22.863
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

35:28.771 --> 35:31.038
- One at a time!
- Follow us! Follow us!

35:31.040 --> 35:33.074
One at a time! Easy! Easy! Easy!

35:33.076 --> 35:34.809
Hey, hey! Take it easy! Slow down!

35:34.811 --> 35:36.577
- Hey, wait, wait, wait!
- Slow down!

35:40.616 --> 35:41.716
Opening up the line!

35:43.720 --> 35:45.619
- You're clear!
- Got your back.

35:45.621 --> 35:47.955
Fire department! Call out!

35:47.957 --> 35:50.124
Fire department, stairwell!

35:50.126 --> 35:52.593
We've got a ladder
at the service elevator!

35:54.764 --> 35:56.497
Oh!

36:24.427 --> 36:26.794
No! No, no, no, no, no!

36:26.796 --> 36:28.662
Help the living, Kidd!

36:28.664 --> 36:31.532
Help the living! Come on!

36:31.534 --> 36:34.668
Fire department! Call out!

36:37.340 --> 36:39.340
Hey, Tony, Capp!

36:39.342 --> 36:40.875
Get them out of here!

36:40.877 --> 36:43.226
- Copy.
- We'll lead you out.

36:47.450 --> 36:48.682
Help! Help!

36:48.684 --> 36:51.352
Hey, okay! Get back!

36:51.354 --> 36:53.421
We'll get you out of here!

36:57.693 --> 36:59.026
Hey, Cruz!

36:59.028 --> 37:01.529
- Get your slamigan in here!
- Copy that.

37:14.710 --> 37:16.066
You need another bottle, Captain?

37:16.068 --> 37:17.326
Yeah.

37:20.149 --> 37:22.083
Thanks.

37:22.085 --> 37:24.919
Chief, I've got smoke inhalation victims

37:24.921 --> 37:26.520
that made it out of the basement

37:26.522 --> 37:28.355
but can't get outside to you.

37:28.357 --> 37:30.157
Request help to evacuate!

37:30.159 --> 37:32.760
70 feet inside the Charlie-side door.

37:32.762 --> 37:34.261
2-11 companies are two minutes out.

37:34.263 --> 37:36.197
I only got ambo 61 out here.

37:36.199 --> 37:38.099
We don't have two minutes, Chief.

37:38.101 --> 37:40.401
Send Brett and Foster in
if you can spare them.

37:40.403 --> 37:42.570
What's the fire like where you are?

37:42.572 --> 37:45.573
They're safe up here.
Floor is two feet of cement.

37:45.575 --> 37:47.174
Basement's another story.

37:50.246 --> 37:54.081
- Keep moving, keep moving.
- Keep moving.

37:54.083 --> 37:56.083
- This way.
- Okay, I'll send them in.

37:56.085 --> 37:59.687
Brett, Foster. Suit up, follow me.

38:06.095 --> 38:07.928
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

38:09.265 --> 38:11.732
Okay, one at a time, everybody!

38:11.734 --> 38:14.034
- Okay, go!
- You heard him.

38:14.036 --> 38:16.704
- One at a time!
- Go! Go! Go!

38:23.913 --> 38:25.813
Ritter, come on!

38:30.620 --> 38:33.454
Oh, no!

38:39.896 --> 38:44.305
Chief, we got an old industrial boiler!

38:44.967 --> 38:46.767
And it's about to blow!

38:46.769 --> 38:49.470
It's gonna take out the whole block!

38:49.472 --> 38:52.806
Get everybody out!
I'm gonna try to hold it off!

38:52.808 --> 38:55.075
Brett, Foster. Come here.

38:55.077 --> 38:56.644
The basement's gonna blow.

38:56.646 --> 38:58.029
You need to get as many
of these victims out

38:58.031 --> 38:59.422
as we can now.

38:59.424 --> 39:00.791
Copy.

39:00.793 --> 39:04.485
All units, I need everyone to evacuate.

39:04.487 --> 39:06.086
Now!

39:06.088 --> 39:08.155
Help! Help!

39:08.157 --> 39:09.456
- Come on!
- Let's get out!

39:09.458 --> 39:11.759
Hold, hold! One at a time!

39:11.761 --> 39:13.994
- One at a time now!
- Easy!

39:15.865 --> 39:18.332
- Go!
- Hold it! One at a time!

39:19.936 --> 39:21.969
Come on!

39:24.307 --> 39:26.840
All right, Ritter, get out!

39:26.842 --> 39:29.810
- That's an order!
- No way, Lieutenant!

39:29.812 --> 39:31.145
Yeah, you're a kid!

39:31.147 --> 39:32.788
You got your whole life in front of you!

39:32.790 --> 39:34.230
Go!

39:34.550 --> 39:36.023
Go!

39:45.027 --> 39:46.527
I'm not leaving you!

39:48.798 --> 39:51.365
Everyone, evacuate! Now!

39:51.367 --> 39:54.335
Hey Chief, we got a fortified door

39:54.337 --> 39:56.367
with at least a half a dozen
people alive in here!

39:56.369 --> 39:57.738
We've got to get them out!

39:57.740 --> 40:00.507
Severide, Cruz, this is an emergency!

40:00.509 --> 40:02.633
Evacuate now!

40:07.750 --> 40:09.293
Get 'em up!

40:09.295 --> 40:10.683
Come on. Think you can get up?

40:10.685 --> 40:12.753
- Brett? Move on.
- Go! Now!

40:12.755 --> 40:14.588
- Let's go.
- Get up!

40:17.693 --> 40:18.926
You guys evacuate!

40:18.928 --> 40:21.095
I'm going back for Severide!

40:21.097 --> 40:23.097
We're in this together, Captain.

40:27.069 --> 40:29.069
Then let's help Severide!

40:32.908 --> 40:35.743
Evacuate! Evacuate!

40:35.745 --> 40:37.778
Come on!

40:42.218 --> 40:44.351
Damn it, Ritter!

40:44.353 --> 40:46.286
Just get out, you dumb kid!

40:46.633 --> 40:49.555
