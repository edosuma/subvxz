WEBVTT

00:02.208 --> 00:04.708
- ( feet shuffling )
- ( man groans )

00:04.708 --> 00:07.000
Man:
 Right in here.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.125
Right this way,
gentlemen.

00:08.125 --> 00:12.416
Bring him
right in here.

00:12.416 --> 00:14.000
( groaning )

00:14.000 --> 00:15.708
- Easy.
- Okay.

00:15.708 --> 00:20.166
( groaning )

00:20.166 --> 00:22.250
Oh, what happened
to his face?

00:22.250 --> 00:23.416
What the hell
do you think?

00:23.416 --> 00:26.291
Some son of a bitch
took a cosh to it.

00:26.291 --> 00:28.541
He looks
healthy enough.

00:28.541 --> 00:30.416
Bed rest
and cold compress

00:30.416 --> 00:32.665
is my professional
prescription.

00:32.665 --> 00:35.791
Only cost
you two bits.
Pay at the door.

00:37.625 --> 00:39.125
The right leg,
sawbones.

00:40.958 --> 00:42.833
Oh.

00:43.625 --> 00:47.000
( groaning )

00:48.625 --> 00:50.500
Ain't you supposed to
wash your hands first?

00:50.500 --> 00:51.791
Are you telling me
how to do my job?

00:51.791 --> 00:54.291
I've been practicing
medicine since the war.

00:54.291 --> 00:57.708
And in all that time,
I can tell you,

00:57.708 --> 01:00.833
I never had a single
complaint from anyone
that lived.

01:00.833 --> 01:03.750
For the love of Christ,
boss, why don't we take
him to the Knick?

01:03.750 --> 01:06.500
Because I don't
want to be in debt

01:06.500 --> 01:08.625
to that crooked
little shit Barrow.

01:08.625 --> 01:10.958
( groans )

01:10.958 --> 01:12.416
How bad is it?

01:12.416 --> 01:14.166
Not as bad
as it might have been.

01:14.166 --> 01:16.125
The bullet
broke the bone.

01:16.125 --> 01:18.375
Looks like it missed
the big artery in there.

01:18.375 --> 01:21.875
Well, I suppose we might
as well get started.

01:21.875 --> 01:25.916
If you gentlemen
would take a firm hold
of your friend.

01:25.916 --> 01:27.833
No! No!
No! No!

01:27.833 --> 01:30.000
All right,
that fucking tears it.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Find a telephone.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.791
( phone ringing )

01:33.791 --> 01:36.000
( clock ticking )

01:38.000 --> 01:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:57.875 --> 02:00.500
Whoever the hell
this is,

02:00.500 --> 02:06.166
go to hell.

02:06.166 --> 02:07.291
( groaning )

02:12.708 --> 02:14.875
( screams )

02:21.041 --> 02:24.041
Hey, I almost forgot.

02:24.041 --> 02:26.833
You owe me two bits
for the consultation.

02:26.833 --> 02:30.125
Treatment comes
with a free shave
and a haircut.

02:30.125 --> 02:32.875
Bring your friend
back around.

02:34.083 --> 02:35.666
If he lives.

02:36.833 --> 02:39.625
( footsteps )

02:48.375 --> 02:50.375
I hate for you
to see me this way.

02:50.375 --> 02:51.458
Believe me,
Mr. Mendieta,

02:51.458 --> 02:53.125
there's nothing
to be ashamed of.

03:01.416 --> 03:03.291
Does it cause you
a great deal of pain?

03:03.291 --> 03:06.750
( winces ) It make it
difficult to walk.

03:08.083 --> 03:10.500
Ah, coÃ±o!
You can push it
all you like,

03:10.500 --> 03:13.250
but it won't go
back in.

03:13.250 --> 03:15.291
I'm sorry to tell you,
you're suffering from

03:15.291 --> 03:18.166
an irreducible indirect,
inguinal hernia.

03:18.166 --> 03:19.750
A weakness in
your peritoneum
has made it possible

03:19.750 --> 03:24.000
for tissue
to insinuate its way
into your scrotal sac.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.708
Do you--
do you understand
what I'm saying?

03:27.708 --> 03:30.791
I understand that you
don't treat me like a man.

03:30.791 --> 03:32.291
Using all your big words

03:32.291 --> 03:35.916
while I stand here
half-naked.

03:38.083 --> 03:39.833
My apologies.

03:41.083 --> 03:43.333
Why don't you get dressed
and I'll explain

03:43.333 --> 03:44.291
what we have to do?

03:47.833 --> 03:50.125
Mendieta.

03:50.125 --> 03:52.166
Is that a Cuban name?

03:52.166 --> 03:55.041
Yes, I come here
after the war.

03:55.041 --> 03:58.041
How do you make
your living?

03:58.041 --> 03:59.041
With your back?

03:59.041 --> 04:02.833
No, I am
 el tabaquero.

04:02.833 --> 04:05.333
I roll cigars.

04:07.541 --> 04:10.625
100% Cuban tobacco.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.500
Thank you.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.916
No, no,
I'll save it
for later.

04:15.916 --> 04:18.958
Esta bien.
It's okay.

04:18.958 --> 04:20.250
Mr. Mendieta,
the only treatment

04:20.250 --> 04:23.208
for your type of hernia
is surgery.

04:23.208 --> 04:25.083
Please.

04:28.416 --> 04:31.791
( sighs )
Unfortunately...

04:31.791 --> 04:34.375
I have yet to perform
an operation

04:34.375 --> 04:36.666
in which
the silk sutures--

04:36.666 --> 04:39.000
the sewing that
reinforces the gut--

04:39.000 --> 04:41.375
hasn't failed.

04:41.375 --> 04:43.333
That's why,
with your permission,
Mr. Mendieta,

04:43.333 --> 04:45.250
I would like to perform
your operation

04:45.250 --> 04:48.708
using a metallic wire
like silver

04:48.708 --> 04:49.125
as a medical suture.

04:52.333 --> 04:57.000
And what happens to me
if this surgery fails, too?

04:59.083 --> 05:02.166
You probably won't die,

05:02.166 --> 05:05.875
but it's possible that you
will suffer intensely for
the rest of your life.

05:07.250 --> 05:08.250
( laughs )

05:13.291 --> 05:15.250
Ah.

05:15.250 --> 05:17.583
They say--

05:17.583 --> 05:20.333
they say every cloud
has a silver lining.

05:20.333 --> 05:24.166
And now Mendieta
will have one, too.

05:26.916 --> 05:28.500
( laughs )

05:28.500 --> 05:31.416
( groaning )

05:31.440 --> 05:36.840

05:36.916 --> 05:38.125
Right this way,
gentlemen, please.

05:44.791 --> 05:47.125
Bunky Collier.

05:47.125 --> 05:48.708
This is one of
Bunky Collier's pimps?

05:48.708 --> 05:50.041
It's his
brother-in-law,
in fact.

05:50.041 --> 05:52.541
Can you save the leg?

05:52.541 --> 05:54.458
What kind of business
have you got with
Bunky Collier?

05:54.458 --> 05:56.083
Can you save
the leg or not?

05:56.083 --> 05:59.750
Edwards, what brings
you here so early
in the morning?

05:59.750 --> 06:03.125
Just trying
to impress you,
Dr. Thackery.

06:03.125 --> 06:05.333
Well, as long
as you're here,
scrub in.

06:05.333 --> 06:07.291
You'll be assisting me
in surgery.

06:07.291 --> 06:08.500
- Like hell he will.
- Who else is there?

06:08.500 --> 06:10.875
- Gallinger?
- He doesn't have
a telephone.

06:10.875 --> 06:12.250
But Dr. Chickering
is on his way.

06:12.250 --> 06:13.916
He lives all
the way uptown.

06:13.916 --> 06:15.166
Time is of
the essence, Barrow.

06:15.166 --> 06:18.083
You want me to save
the personage or not?

06:18.083 --> 06:20.625
Very well,
gentlemen.

06:31.375 --> 06:33.208
Knuckle dragger.

06:33.208 --> 06:35.541
Excuse me?

06:35.541 --> 06:37.958
I assume
you've read Darwin.

06:43.166 --> 06:45.583
( groaning )

06:51.583 --> 06:54.791
You're certainly taking
your damn time about it.

06:54.791 --> 06:56.500
Ought to plug you
in the leg.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.416
See how fast things
move around here then.

07:01.416 --> 07:03.916
The doctors
will begin shortly.

07:05.458 --> 07:07.875
In the meantime,
I thought we might discuss

07:07.875 --> 07:11.125
the matter of compensation
for my services.

07:11.125 --> 07:12.041
I told you
in the carriage.

07:12.041 --> 07:14.500
I'll cut 500
from your debt

07:14.500 --> 07:16.125
if you don't
lose the leg.

07:16.125 --> 07:18.041
Fair enough?

07:18.041 --> 07:22.833
Not fair at all,
actually.

07:22.833 --> 07:26.291
500 barely covers
a few months' interest.

07:26.291 --> 07:29.833
( man groaning )

07:29.833 --> 07:32.375
Thank you, nurses.
We'll take it from here.

07:40.916 --> 07:43.375
What the hell is that?

07:43.375 --> 07:44.875
What's that coon
think he's doing
down there?

07:44.875 --> 07:47.666
Barrow:
We're understaffed
this early in the morning.

07:47.666 --> 07:50.958
I can assure you,
Dr. Edwards will only
be assisting in the surgery.

07:50.958 --> 07:53.958
Collier:
 That black bastard better not
 get too familiar with my man

07:53.958 --> 07:57.500
if he don't want
to find himself hanging
from a lamppost.

07:57.500 --> 07:59.250
( groaning stops )

08:01.208 --> 08:03.375
One thing more.

08:03.375 --> 08:05.250
If he loses that leg,

08:05.250 --> 08:09.291
I'll compensate you
by shooting all three of you
in the fucking face.

08:16.125 --> 08:17.625
How's his pulse?

08:21.250 --> 08:23.333
Weak, but steady.

08:23.791 --> 08:26.291
Vacuum.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.291
( crank rattling )

08:36.291 --> 08:40.707
Christ, the bullet
is lodged in the tunica.

08:40.707 --> 08:43.416
It's the only reason
he hasn't already
bled to death.

08:45.541 --> 08:47.333
Do you really think
we'll be able to save
this leg?

08:47.333 --> 08:50.583
I'm not even sure
we can save the man.

08:50.583 --> 08:52.875
Tourniquet.

09:16.041 --> 09:17.750
We need to take
the leg off now.

09:17.750 --> 09:20.000
It's already showing
signs of necrosis.

09:23.458 --> 09:27.291
Thackery:
Can't get the broken
bones to set.

09:31.625 --> 09:34.208
Edwards:
 His pulse is eccentric.
 We need to amputate now.

09:47.291 --> 09:49.708
( tools clanking )

10:01.000 --> 10:03.083
( crunches )

10:13.291 --> 10:18.166
See, the sharp ends
of the broken bones

10:18.166 --> 10:20.125
were preventing
secure connection.

10:20.125 --> 10:23.000
Would you thread me up
a length of catgut?

10:28.791 --> 10:32.083
See, the...

10:33.041 --> 10:36.083
funny thing about Darwin.

10:36.083 --> 10:39.541
You know, he wanted
to be a doctor.

10:40.625 --> 10:43.750
Couldn't stand
the sight of blood.

10:45.625 --> 10:47.458
Cornelia:
 Has anyone else
 experienced

10:47.458 --> 10:49.833
symptoms of typhoid
since the boys fell ill?

10:49.833 --> 10:52.541
Miss Carhart:
 Not that I know of,
 Miss Robertson.

10:52.541 --> 10:56.291
- Did the boys dine
anywhere unusual lately?
- No.

10:56.291 --> 10:59.333
Have they had occasion to
relieve themselves anywhere
outside of here?

10:59.333 --> 11:01.875
An outhouse, say,
or latrine?

11:01.875 --> 11:05.000
- I beg your pardon?
- How many toilets you got
 in this joint anyway?

11:05.000 --> 11:06.166
You're welcome
to count them.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.625
Are all the staff
here today?

11:08.625 --> 11:10.458
All but three
who were released
last week.

11:10.458 --> 11:13.250
We needed fewer staff
at the summer home.

11:13.250 --> 11:14.500
Cornelia:
Which three were released?

11:14.500 --> 11:16.708
Mr. Brock, the electric
automobile driver,

11:16.708 --> 11:20.375
Miss Mallon
and Miss Monroe,
assistants to the cook.

11:20.375 --> 11:22.208
Do you have
their addresses?

11:22.208 --> 11:25.208
If I do, they're in
the household accounts.

11:25.208 --> 11:28.000
Do you handle
much raw food
this time of year?

11:28.000 --> 11:30.125
Some fruits
and vegetables,
of course.

11:30.125 --> 11:33.041
- Ice cream?
- Oh, yes. Every day.

11:33.041 --> 11:34.791
Now, where are the lord
and lady of the house
this fine morning?

11:34.791 --> 11:38.500
Mrs. Cooke spent
the night at the hospital
with the boys

11:38.500 --> 11:40.875
and Mr. Cooke left word
he was not to be disturbed.

11:40.875 --> 11:42.750
That ain't up to him.

11:42.750 --> 11:44.500
For all his money,
he shouldn't think

11:44.500 --> 11:46.583
that he's immune
to this disease.

11:46.583 --> 11:49.250
Unless, of course,
he's got a servant who
wipes his ass for him.

11:49.250 --> 11:52.125
Don't think for a moment
he doesn't.

11:56.833 --> 11:58.583
Christ.

11:58.583 --> 12:01.375
It gets so humid
in this town.

12:02.333 --> 12:05.000
It's all
the tall buildings.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.458
They capture
the heat.

12:33.166 --> 12:36.708
A pleasure,
as always, Doctor.

12:46.958 --> 12:49.416
How's our personage?

12:49.416 --> 12:51.250
He's still bipedal.

12:51.250 --> 12:54.791
I'll take the drain
out in 24 hours.

12:54.791 --> 12:56.250
If there's no pus
within a week,

12:56.250 --> 12:58.125
he should make
a complete recovery.

12:58.125 --> 13:00.291
So he will
walk again?

13:00.291 --> 13:02.625
Oh, he'll be back
to accommodating you

13:02.625 --> 13:06.916
at one of
Collier's cathouses
in no time at all.

13:17.083 --> 13:19.791
Still got a few minutes.

13:19.791 --> 13:20.750
Why don't you
get cleaned up?

13:20.750 --> 13:23.791
For what?

13:24.833 --> 13:26.833
You haven't forgotten,
have you?

13:26.833 --> 13:30.708
The Edison people
are making their
presentation at noon.

13:30.708 --> 13:33.250
( groans )

14:14.583 --> 14:17.541
It gives me great pleasure
to present today

14:17.541 --> 14:21.000
the Edison X-ray
photographic apparatus.

14:23.250 --> 14:24.458
Evelyn, if you'll
be so kind.

14:24.458 --> 14:28.416
One places
the photographic
plate here

14:28.416 --> 14:32.000
while the patient's
afflicted limb is then
placed on top of that.

14:34.416 --> 14:35.541
( electricity humming )

14:35.541 --> 14:37.666
The X-ray tube
is then activated.

14:37.666 --> 14:40.875
And the result
is the X-ray photograph.

14:40.875 --> 14:43.375
A peerless tool
for medical diagnosis.

14:45.250 --> 14:47.250
Those are
actually the bones?

14:47.250 --> 14:49.958
They are,
specifically of
a 35-year-old woman.

14:49.958 --> 14:54.250
You can see
the phalanges here.
The proximal, the distal.

14:54.250 --> 14:57.958
And here where
she fractured her second
and third metacarpals.

14:57.958 --> 14:59.958
Sewing machine,
I believe.

14:59.958 --> 15:03.041
- It's incredible.
- It's the future.

15:03.041 --> 15:04.833
And what does the future
cost these days?

15:04.833 --> 15:05.833
Thackery:
$3,000.

15:05.833 --> 15:07.500
Are you insane?

15:07.500 --> 15:09.916
Cornelia:
 We've just spent
 the past hour

15:09.916 --> 15:11.416
discussing cost-cutting
measures.

15:11.416 --> 15:13.833
And now you want to splurge
on some sideshow attraction?

15:13.833 --> 15:18.083
You think that saving
money by not laundering
staff uniforms

15:18.083 --> 15:20.666
and charging them for meals
as Mr. Barrow suggests

15:20.666 --> 15:22.583
will suddenly bring back
patients with money?

15:22.583 --> 15:26.333
In less than a year,
I guarantee that the X-ray

15:26.333 --> 15:28.833
will be the new standard
in diagnosis.

15:28.833 --> 15:31.125
For once, let us be ahead
of the other hospitals.

15:31.125 --> 15:32.583
Habershorn:
 The only way we're going to be
 able to afford this machine

15:32.583 --> 15:36.083
is if the heavens open up
and rain gold down on us.

15:36.083 --> 15:38.666
Short of that, we'll need
to consider other options.

15:38.666 --> 15:40.416
Thackery:
What other options?

15:40.416 --> 15:44.166
Moving the Knick
uptown to where all
the money has gone.

15:44.166 --> 15:46.166
Our former donors
will come back to us.

15:46.166 --> 15:48.458
We can become
profitable again.

15:48.458 --> 15:51.041
The value of this building
is only going down.

15:51.041 --> 15:54.333
The neighborhood continues
to be overrun by the poor
and unwashed.

15:54.333 --> 15:56.291
Cornelia:
 Who need us.

15:56.291 --> 15:58.208
Practically every other
hospital has fled uptown.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.416
Who will be left
to care for them?

16:00.416 --> 16:01.791
We've given them more
than their fair share.

16:01.791 --> 16:05.416
Even the monsignor
won't find it hard
to argue

16:05.416 --> 16:08.666
that we've held
our charitable hand
out much too long.

16:08.666 --> 16:12.625
Medical advice is as much
a commodity as bread.

16:12.625 --> 16:16.208
And to give
either one or the other
to the unworthy is wrong.

16:16.208 --> 16:18.916
It encourages
irresponsibility

16:18.916 --> 16:21.250
and reckless use
of valuable resources.

16:21.250 --> 16:23.875
Now, I have a prime
piece of grassland

16:23.875 --> 16:26.500
on 5th Avenue
and 80th Street which--

16:26.500 --> 16:28.583
Thackery:
How will moving to
the middle of nowhere help

16:28.583 --> 16:31.000
except to
shorten your commute
to these meetings?

16:31.000 --> 16:33.916
And how will living
in a fantasy where bills
don't need to be paid

16:33.916 --> 16:36.916
and expensive resources are
tossed out to the impoverished

16:36.916 --> 16:39.166
like silver coins
from a railroad man's
carriage help either?

16:43.750 --> 16:45.916
It's nice in here.

16:45.916 --> 16:48.333
It is with you.

16:50.708 --> 16:54.333
( sighs )

16:54.333 --> 16:56.666
If I could,
I would take you away.

16:59.458 --> 17:01.875
And go somewhere.

17:01.875 --> 17:04.540
Montreal,
a beach in Carolina.

17:06.875 --> 17:09.040
Leave everyone behind.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.540
I'd go anywhere
you told me to.

17:16.500 --> 17:18.333
I had the money, Junia.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.540
I tried.

17:26.125 --> 17:28.583
I try every day
to get there.

17:30.208 --> 17:33.125
But I've made
some mistakes.

17:34.833 --> 17:36.250
What sort of mistakes?

17:41.250 --> 17:44.083
I took money

17:44.083 --> 17:46.750
from my employer.

17:48.416 --> 17:50.583
I invested it with
a Wall Street man

17:50.583 --> 17:52.541
that said
it couldn't lose.

17:54.166 --> 17:56.208
Then it did.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.541
So I took more money
and I tried to get it back.

18:02.958 --> 18:06.416
Then we had the drop
of '98 and we all lost.

18:06.416 --> 18:10.625
All except for Harriman
and Vanderbilt and his ilk.

18:10.625 --> 18:12.666
They always
sail on through,

18:12.666 --> 18:14.666
rich as ever.

18:21.708 --> 18:23.666
Do you even know
what I'm talking about?

18:25.916 --> 18:27.291
Not really.

18:27.291 --> 18:30.250
- ( urinating )
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

18:39.458 --> 18:40.541
Hello, Mr. Barrow.

18:40.541 --> 18:42.833
Officer.

18:42.833 --> 18:45.333
I come looking
for a favor.

18:45.333 --> 18:49.458
Well, in here,
four bucks will get
you any favor you want.

18:49.458 --> 18:51.833
It's of
a different nature.

18:51.833 --> 18:54.541
I want to propose
a little business
with Mr. Collier

18:54.541 --> 18:56.208
and I need
a proper introducing.

18:56.208 --> 19:00.166
What makes you think
I know this man Collier?

19:00.166 --> 19:02.833
I've seen you coming out
of his place a few times.

19:02.833 --> 19:04.416
Been watching the door
there for a while now.

19:04.416 --> 19:06.291
Well, I only go in there
to get cigarillos
for my wife.

19:06.291 --> 19:08.625
That's very
accommodating of them,

19:08.625 --> 19:10.791
making a 10-cent sale
at 2:00 in the morning.

19:10.791 --> 19:13.750
( sighs )

19:13.750 --> 19:15.375
What'd you have in mind?

19:15.375 --> 19:17.708
We get a lot of girls
off the street.

19:17.708 --> 19:19.458
Round them up
and bring them in.

19:19.458 --> 19:21.166
Freelancers
who hook for no one.

19:21.166 --> 19:25.041
I thought if I could
convince a few of them
to work for Mr. Collier,

19:25.041 --> 19:28.250
he protects them,
gives them a good place
like this to work and--

19:28.250 --> 19:30.541
Give you some money
for bringing them in.

19:30.541 --> 19:31.833
It's good for everyone.

19:31.833 --> 19:35.208
It's a service to the girls
and to Mr. Collier.

19:35.208 --> 19:37.958
I just need someone
to vouch for me
with the man.

19:37.958 --> 19:40.625
Tell Mr. Collier
I'm on the level,
no tricks.

19:40.625 --> 19:43.791
I thought since we knew
each other from Mr. Speight

19:43.791 --> 19:46.416
and other dealings
at your hospital,
you might be inclined.

19:46.416 --> 19:48.458
And what would your boss,
Big Bill Devery,

19:48.458 --> 19:49.250
think of your
little scheme?

19:49.250 --> 19:51.833
He'd probably want a cut.

19:51.833 --> 19:55.416
So let's not ask.

19:55.416 --> 19:58.500
It's just I got more
mouths to feed at home
than he's willing to pay.

19:59.958 --> 20:00.791
Can you do me
this favor, Mr. Barrow?

20:00.791 --> 20:04.333
Well, you see, Phinny,

20:04.333 --> 20:06.125
these things
don't come free.

20:13.500 --> 20:16.083
Well, what do you know?
Right on time.

20:16.083 --> 20:19.166
Punctuality is
the politeness
of cadence.

20:19.166 --> 20:21.333
Is that so?

20:21.333 --> 20:24.458
I'll have to
remember that, Harry.

20:24.458 --> 20:26.291
Well, we shouldn't keep
a paying customer waiting.

20:33.041 --> 20:35.833
Cleary:
 And here is
 the patient herself.

20:35.833 --> 20:37.750
Say hello, Mrs. Sung.

20:37.750 --> 20:39.916
( speaking Mandarin )

20:45.541 --> 20:48.166
Excuse me,
Mr. Cleary.

20:48.166 --> 20:50.291
Please, we change
our minds

20:50.291 --> 20:52.375
and we must ask you
please to leave.

20:52.375 --> 20:55.041
What are you
talking about, leave?

20:55.041 --> 20:56.708
Your wife is here
to have the procedure.

20:56.708 --> 20:58.500
My wife thinks now
the procedure

20:58.500 --> 21:00.250
is contrary
to the will of God.

21:00.250 --> 21:01.791
What do you know
about the will of God?
You're bloody heathens.

21:01.791 --> 21:04.375
We are Christians.

21:04.375 --> 21:05.791
We were converted
at the Methodist school
in Peking.

21:05.791 --> 21:09.000
- And she's a fucking
Catholic nun.
- Cleary!

21:09.000 --> 21:10.500
There's not a higher
authority in the land

21:10.500 --> 21:12.875
when it comes to matters
of the fucking catechism.

21:12.875 --> 21:14.583
God, fucking Methodists.

21:14.583 --> 21:16.375
Would you get over
with the nun?

21:16.375 --> 21:17.833
I'm just trying to ease
her conscience a bit.

21:17.833 --> 21:20.833
( speaking Mandarin )

21:24.541 --> 21:27.625
There, look,
she's all docile
and ready for you.

21:34.250 --> 21:37.083
So, how shall
we begin?

21:37.083 --> 21:39.666
You'll be wanting her
to strip naked, I suppose.

21:39.666 --> 21:42.000
We'll begin with you
leaving the premises
at once.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.333
Can't I watch?

21:44.333 --> 21:46.875
Well, you can't object
to me sitting in
the kitchen.

21:46.875 --> 21:48.250
All right,
all right.

21:48.250 --> 21:50.625
There's a saloon
on the corner.

21:50.625 --> 21:51.625
I'll stand myself
a growler.

21:51.625 --> 21:54.208
And can stand him
one as well.

22:04.458 --> 22:07.708
- ( baby crying )
- Shh, shh, shh.

22:11.541 --> 22:13.208
How long has she
been like this?

22:13.208 --> 22:15.375
Since you left
this morning.

22:15.375 --> 22:18.541
Poor little thing.
She brought up her breakfast

22:18.541 --> 22:20.750
and she hasn't
stopped crying long enough
to nurse since then.

22:20.750 --> 22:22.416
All right, shh, shh.

22:22.416 --> 22:23.333
Please put her
on the table.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.208
( crying continues )

22:45.875 --> 22:48.125
We need to get Lillian
to the Knick right away.

22:48.125 --> 22:50.083
- What is it?
- Go the bedroom,
get the baby's things.

22:50.083 --> 22:52.000
- I'll call a carriage.
- What's the matter with
her, Everett?

22:52.000 --> 22:55.250
- I'll tell you
in the carriage.
- No, tell me now.

22:55.250 --> 22:56.708
She's presenting
the symptoms of
meningitis.

22:56.708 --> 22:58.333
- What is that?
- It's a viral infection
of the brain,

22:58.333 --> 23:01.041
and a stiff neck
is a common symptom.

23:01.041 --> 23:03.666
I just can't be certain.
That's why we need to go
to the hospital now.

23:12.333 --> 23:14.291
Where's Mr. Sung?

23:14.291 --> 23:17.166
Oh, you're priceless,
you know that?

23:17.166 --> 23:19.041
You didn't think I was
really gonna bend an elbow

23:19.041 --> 23:20.666
with the yellow menace,
did you?

23:20.666 --> 23:22.333
You got here quick.

23:22.333 --> 23:24.166
Foam's not even settled
on my beer yet.

23:24.166 --> 23:26.250
I didn't go through
with it.

23:26.250 --> 23:27.750
What the hell are you
talking about, you didn't
go through with it?

23:27.750 --> 23:31.041
She was seven months along.
The child had quickened.

23:31.041 --> 23:32.541
Fuck does that mean?

23:32.541 --> 23:33.958
It means she could
feel it kicking.

23:33.958 --> 23:37.500
Let that be a lesson to you.
It would have been a sin.

23:38.916 --> 23:40.708
Stand me one of those.

23:43.708 --> 23:47.041
Not a very auspicious start
to our partnership.

23:48.125 --> 23:49.708
I think you made
the right choice

23:49.708 --> 23:51.666
frog-marching me
out of there, though.

23:51.666 --> 23:53.625
No reason both of us
should go to Sing Sing

23:53.625 --> 23:55.416
if the guard were to
catch you red-handed,

23:55.416 --> 23:56.375
so to speak.

23:56.375 --> 23:58.125
You're a real gent,
Cleary.

23:58.125 --> 24:00.916
And let no man
say otherwise.

24:00.916 --> 24:06.083
But the law says
that anyone caught aiding
or abetting abortion

24:06.083 --> 24:08.666
shall be punished
in like manner as
the principal offender.

24:08.666 --> 24:11.083
Made a study of law,
have you?

24:11.083 --> 24:13.083
So should you
if this is to be
your only livelihood

24:13.083 --> 24:15.708
after the hospital closes.

24:15.708 --> 24:17.416
And who says
the hospital is closing?

24:17.416 --> 24:20.000
The smart money
is moving uptown.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.041
The Knick will have
to do the same if it doesn't
want to be shuttered.

24:23.041 --> 24:24.583
And there's nothing
you nor I

24:24.583 --> 24:26.916
nor even the great
John W. Thackery can
do about it,

24:26.916 --> 24:31.708
no matter the miracles
he's had to perform in
the operating theater.

24:31.708 --> 24:34.416
And if the hospital moves
uptown, will you go with it?

24:34.416 --> 24:37.291
I'll go wherever
the Church sends me.

24:37.291 --> 24:39.625
Well, that's just peachy
for you, Sister.

24:39.625 --> 24:41.625
But I'll have you know,

24:41.625 --> 24:43.958
I'm a man what makes
his own fate.

24:43.958 --> 24:45.458
There's nothing stopping
Tom Cleary

24:45.458 --> 24:49.041
from following
the smart money,
as you call it,

24:49.041 --> 24:51.666
anywhere it may lead,
and that includes uptown.

24:51.666 --> 24:55.208
( chuckles )
You, my friend, aren't
following anything smart.

24:55.208 --> 24:57.833
Not until you acquire
some fine manners

24:57.833 --> 25:00.458
and learn to drive
a motorized car.

25:00.458 --> 25:02.166
And dress presentably.

25:02.166 --> 25:02.750
And fucking shave.

25:02.750 --> 25:05.625
( laughs )

25:05.625 --> 25:08.250
Barring all that,
we're stuck with each other.

25:08.250 --> 25:10.750
- SlÃ¡inte.
- SlÃ¡inte.

25:10.750 --> 25:12.541
- ( clinks )
- ( laughs )

25:18.458 --> 25:20.625
Saddle of lamb

25:20.625 --> 25:22.416
Ã  la Colbert.

25:23.708 --> 25:25.791
Astonishing.

25:25.791 --> 25:28.708
I had the great pleasure
to sample this very dish

25:28.708 --> 25:32.000
only last week.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.875
I believe it is
Charles' specialty.

25:34.875 --> 25:37.083
Charles?

25:37.083 --> 25:38.666
Ranhoefer.

25:38.666 --> 25:39.750
The chef at Delmonico's.

25:39.750 --> 25:42.291
I wouldn't know.

25:42.291 --> 25:44.250
I haven't been to
Delmonico's in years.

25:44.250 --> 25:46.083
No, I was speaking
about this.

25:46.083 --> 25:49.083
The ability to see
inside the human body

25:49.083 --> 25:51.041
without penetrating
the flesh.

25:51.041 --> 25:53.958
You know, the first
great fortunes that were
amassed on this planet

25:53.958 --> 25:55.375
were a result
of the material,

25:55.375 --> 25:59.208
the wealth that God
put in and on the Earth--

25:59.208 --> 26:01.833
gold and copper,
lumber, iron ore.

26:01.833 --> 26:04.541
But this,

26:04.541 --> 26:08.375
this has demonstrated to me
that the next great fortunes

26:08.375 --> 26:12.000
will be a result
of the immaterial.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.250
The unseen wealth
buzzing all around us

26:14.250 --> 26:17.000
like electricity
and X-rays.

26:19.875 --> 26:21.875
Mmm.

26:27.166 --> 26:29.458
So how much?

26:29.458 --> 26:32.708
$3,000 for
a single machine.

26:32.708 --> 26:34.666
( laughs )

26:34.666 --> 26:36.083
See?

26:36.083 --> 26:40.083
They're already earning
a fortune on the immaterial.

26:40.083 --> 26:42.250
( laughs )

26:42.250 --> 26:44.291
We'll discuss it
over cigars.

26:46.166 --> 26:49.166
Oh, I thought
I might see you here
tonight, Robertson.

26:49.166 --> 26:50.583
Corky.

26:50.583 --> 26:53.833
Tell me,

26:53.833 --> 26:57.541
when was the last time
you dined at Delmonico's?

26:57.541 --> 27:00.791
You wouldn't find
a Vanderbilt dead
at that place.

27:00.791 --> 27:02.666
It only attracts
the riffraff.

27:02.666 --> 27:04.250
You know, I'm sorry
to intrude,

27:04.250 --> 27:06.375
but I wanted
to thank you

27:06.375 --> 27:08.250
for arranging
the luncheon next week
with the governor.

27:08.250 --> 27:09.875
Happy to oblige.

27:09.875 --> 27:13.750
To this day,
I can't imagine what
possessed the Panamanians

27:13.750 --> 27:16.166
to entrust that project
to the French.

27:16.166 --> 27:18.750
Well, they built
the Suez Canal.

27:18.750 --> 27:20.208
That was years ago.

27:20.208 --> 27:22.625
And what have we here?

27:22.625 --> 27:25.458
X-ray.

27:25.458 --> 27:26.791
This is
an excellent device,

27:26.791 --> 27:29.416
this X-ray machine.

27:29.416 --> 27:31.583
I donated two of them
to Manhattan Hospital.

27:31.583 --> 27:32.916
Well...

27:32.916 --> 27:35.625
enjoy your lamb.

27:39.916 --> 27:42.083
Chateau Lagrange.

27:42.583 --> 27:45.416
'84.

27:46.791 --> 27:49.125
( sniffs )

27:54.625 --> 27:56.791
( sniffs )

28:05.458 --> 28:07.250
You can have the machine.

28:13.291 --> 28:15.208
( humming )

28:20.916 --> 28:23.333
The hernial sac
has been cut

28:23.333 --> 28:27.083
and the bowel
is being reinserted
into the peritoneum.

28:37.208 --> 28:39.541
Miss Odom.

28:39.541 --> 28:41.375
Please stitch
the bottom layer

28:41.375 --> 28:43.333
as I showed you.

28:46.708 --> 28:48.750
Dr. Edwards,
how did a man like you

28:48.750 --> 28:52.625
ever get his hands
on something as expensive
as silver wire?

28:52.625 --> 28:54.708
It wasn't that hard.

28:54.708 --> 28:56.125
Just don't ask to see
my pocket watch.

29:02.708 --> 29:05.416
Miss Manx?

29:08.708 --> 29:10.125
Pulse is strong
and steady.

29:14.125 --> 29:15.333
Mrs. Gamble.

29:18.458 --> 29:20.250
Another here

29:20.250 --> 29:22.166
with an emphasis
on the stitching.

29:22.708 --> 29:25.375
( clicks )

29:29.416 --> 29:33.041
Girl, it's a crying shame
all those pretty
silver stitches

29:33.041 --> 29:35.500
is going to seal up
that fat man.

29:35.500 --> 29:37.375
( laughs )

29:37.375 --> 29:40.666
- ( footsteps )
- Shh, shh, shh.

29:40.666 --> 29:44.041
( woman laughing )

29:47.166 --> 29:50.583
( kissing )

29:50.583 --> 29:52.416
You remembered
to bring something,
didn't you?

29:52.416 --> 29:54.250
- What?
- French letter.

29:54.250 --> 29:56.416
I won't let you
put it in me without
wearing one.

29:56.416 --> 29:58.625
That's a matter
of life and death.
You're a nurse.

29:58.625 --> 30:00.125
You wouldn't refuse
comfort to a dying man.

30:00.125 --> 30:02.541
At least take me
someplace

30:02.541 --> 30:04.416
where I won't get
coal dust on my knees.

30:04.416 --> 30:06.250
It's filthy down here.

30:08.125 --> 30:10.375
( footsteps departing )

30:21.958 --> 30:22.791
All right, ladies.
Show's over.

30:22.791 --> 30:25.500
Back to work.

30:28.958 --> 30:31.916
- ( knocks )
- Boss, you ain't
gonna believe this.

30:33.250 --> 30:34.791
Good evening.

30:35.958 --> 30:38.708
Roundsman Sears
of the 19th Precinct,

30:38.708 --> 30:39.333
meet Bunky Collier.

30:41.083 --> 30:44.125
What the fuck
is this, Barrow?

30:44.125 --> 30:45.791
Some kind of threat?

30:45.791 --> 30:48.958
( chuckles )
It's a business
proposal.

30:50.416 --> 30:54.083
I do business with
coppers all the time.

30:54.083 --> 30:56.291
The hell I need
another one for?

30:56.291 --> 30:59.958
Well, Roundsman Sears
is particularly
well situated

30:59.958 --> 31:02.583
to supply you with
your stock in trade.

31:02.583 --> 31:04.625
What's that?
Cigars?

31:04.625 --> 31:07.916
Whores.

31:12.416 --> 31:14.833
The 19th Precinct

31:14.833 --> 31:17.166
is in the Tenderloin,
ain't it?

31:18.833 --> 31:20.541
My boys can't walk down
the sidewalk there,

31:20.541 --> 31:22.125
it's so crowded
with whores.

31:22.125 --> 31:25.083
What have you got
that they don't have?

31:25.083 --> 31:27.458
A uniform.

31:27.458 --> 31:31.875
You see,
every day I arrest
pretty young girls

31:31.875 --> 31:33.541
who are down
on their luck.

31:33.541 --> 31:36.875
One look at a uniform
alongside the threat
of incarceration

31:36.875 --> 31:39.875
is all it requires for
the tender young things

31:39.875 --> 31:42.541
to agree enthusiastically
to any alternative

31:42.541 --> 31:43.333
I should happen
to propose.

31:47.333 --> 31:49.375
What does this mutt
get out of the deal?

31:49.375 --> 31:54.166
First of all, let me
put your mind at ease.

31:54.166 --> 31:56.833
I looked in on
your brother-in-law
this evening

31:56.833 --> 32:00.000
and the doctors
assure me he will make
a full recovery.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.666
Don't think you're
dipping your bucket
into that well again.

32:02.666 --> 32:05.541
I'll take a flat fee
deducted from my debt

32:05.541 --> 32:07.291
for every girl
that Phinny recruits.

32:09.208 --> 32:12.083
Beginning with
the two outside.

32:14.166 --> 32:16.416
Two, you say?

32:31.375 --> 32:33.500
What's your name?

32:33.500 --> 32:34.291
Millicent.

32:36.500 --> 32:39.416
I don't normally
keep coons,

32:39.416 --> 32:40.916
but you have
a nice figure.

32:40.916 --> 32:43.708
If a customer asks,

32:43.708 --> 32:46.666
tell him
you're an octoroon,
understand?

32:49.333 --> 32:50.458
What's your name?

32:50.458 --> 32:53.083
Alice.

32:53.083 --> 32:55.250
We ain't got
an Alice,

32:55.250 --> 32:57.291
but we got a surfeit
of blondes.

32:57.291 --> 33:01.166
So from now on,
you're a redhead.

33:01.166 --> 33:03.916
The cost of the dye
to be deducted from
your pay.

33:04.708 --> 33:07.708
All right, girls,

33:07.708 --> 33:09.583
show me the goods.

33:11.500 --> 33:12.666
( sighs )

33:12.666 --> 33:15.291
You'll be provided
with room and board

33:15.291 --> 33:16.833
on a weekly basis,

33:16.833 --> 33:19.208
which will also be deducted
from your pay.

33:19.208 --> 33:21.458
Twice a month
you'll be examined

33:21.458 --> 33:23.750
by a lady doctor,
who will see

33:23.750 --> 33:25.125
that you are not sick
or pregnant.

33:28.791 --> 33:31.166
Very nice.

33:31.166 --> 33:33.250
Thank you.

33:33.250 --> 33:35.166
My colleague Jimmy here

33:35.166 --> 33:38.041
will now test your level
of enthusiasm.

33:48.166 --> 33:49.708
Always a pleasure.

34:01.625 --> 34:05.250
- ( piano playing )
- ( muffled conversation )

34:13.875 --> 34:16.916
( knocking )

34:25.166 --> 34:27.250
Neely, what are you
doing here?

34:27.250 --> 34:28.250
It's your mother.

34:31.375 --> 34:33.000
Tell me
what happened.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.625
She's complained of pain
in her lower back

34:34.625 --> 34:35.958
for the past few days.

34:35.958 --> 34:37.125
She's also been
unable to urinate.

34:37.125 --> 34:39.791
Tonight the pain
intensified,

34:39.791 --> 34:41.375
so my father asked me
to fetch you.

34:54.125 --> 34:56.708
What the hell
are you doing here?

34:56.708 --> 34:58.250
I was called here
to treat this lady.

34:58.250 --> 35:00.958
Don't blame
Dr. Thackery, Algie.

35:00.958 --> 35:03.500
The captain thought
your presence would
be a comfort to me.

35:03.500 --> 35:05.666
Mother, you have
a pain in your back?

35:05.666 --> 35:07.375
- Something terrible.
- It could be appendicitis.

35:07.375 --> 35:09.875
We need to get her
to the hospital now.

35:09.875 --> 35:12.666
She also has
a swelling in the area
of the right kidney.

35:12.666 --> 35:15.791
I think it's probably
just a cyst causing
a blockage.

35:15.791 --> 35:17.583
- I'm going to pop it.
- ( screams )

35:17.583 --> 35:20.833
Edwards: Stop!
 You could rupture
 her appendix and kill her.

35:20.833 --> 35:23.708
Nonsense.
If she had appendicitis,
she'd have a fever.

35:23.708 --> 35:26.333
- ( grunts )
- Oh! Oh!

35:26.333 --> 35:27.250
Oh!

35:28.875 --> 35:32.750
Well, something went.

35:32.750 --> 35:34.250
You gentlemen will have
to excuse me now.

35:34.250 --> 35:37.541
I need to pay a visit
to the privy.

35:38.166 --> 35:39.416
Thank you, Doctor.

35:39.416 --> 35:42.750
There's probably a little
blood in the stream,

35:42.750 --> 35:44.583
but there's nothing
to worry about.

35:50.791 --> 35:52.458
Doctor.

35:59.541 --> 36:01.208
( sighs )

36:06.333 --> 36:08.041
Is she gonna
be all right?

36:08.041 --> 36:10.250
- It was nothing serious.
- Oh, thank God.

36:10.250 --> 36:12.291
She just needs a day
or two of bed rest.

36:12.291 --> 36:14.041
Her boy can look in
on her.

36:14.041 --> 36:16.833
Thank you, Thack.
I was just heading
back to the club.

36:16.833 --> 36:19.208
Had to fold a hell
of a hand to rush
back here.

36:19.208 --> 36:21.083
I'll walk you out.

36:26.458 --> 36:28.708
Tell me, Thack,

36:28.708 --> 36:30.625
how is Cornelia?

36:30.625 --> 36:32.208
What do you mean?

36:32.208 --> 36:33.291
How is she doing
at the Knick?

36:33.291 --> 36:35.958
Am I well represented
by her?

36:35.958 --> 36:40.333
Or am I seen as a fool
who can't say no
to his little girl?

36:40.333 --> 36:42.625
Anyone who views her
as a little girl

36:42.625 --> 36:44.416
does so at their
own peril.

36:44.416 --> 36:47.000
You haven't really
answered my question.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.125
You should be proud.

36:49.125 --> 36:52.333
In 10 years,
she could be running
the whole hospital.

36:52.333 --> 36:56.291
In 10 years, I expect
to have a gaggle
of grandchildren.

36:56.291 --> 36:59.500
I hope she understands
that when she's married,

36:59.500 --> 37:01.875
she'll have other
responsibilities
to her husband.

37:01.875 --> 37:04.333
Does she know that?

37:04.333 --> 37:06.833
Because if not,
it could be one hell
of a conversation.

37:06.833 --> 37:08.916
( laughs )

37:10.291 --> 37:13.500
If you'd be willing
to have it with her,

37:13.500 --> 37:15.708
I would be forever
in your debt.

37:15.708 --> 37:17.333
You're already
in my debt.

37:19.166 --> 37:21.208
Nicaragua.

37:21.208 --> 37:23.166
Yes.

37:23.166 --> 37:24.125
Hmm.

37:26.791 --> 37:29.083
Ah.

37:31.666 --> 37:34.291
Doesn't seem
possible, but...

37:34.291 --> 37:37.208
feels hotter here
than it ever did
down there.

37:37.208 --> 37:40.250
- It's all the buildings.
- Oh, is that so?

37:40.250 --> 37:42.250
They capture the heat.

37:50.541 --> 37:52.583
( baby cooing )

38:16.875 --> 38:19.125
How long have you
been standing there?

38:19.125 --> 38:20.250
Only a moment.

38:20.250 --> 38:23.166
You look quite natural
with children.

38:25.708 --> 38:27.500
I wanted
to ask you, Nurse,

38:27.500 --> 38:31.000
if you've ever visited
the Eden MusÃ©e before.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
The dime museum
on 23rd Street?

38:33.000 --> 38:35.333
- Mmm.
- No, I haven't.

38:35.333 --> 38:37.291
Well, they have
a lovely winter garden

38:37.291 --> 38:38.625
that I feel like
you would enjoy.

38:38.625 --> 38:42.625
You can have an ice cream
and listen to music.

38:42.625 --> 38:46.000
I think I'd like the waxworks
at the Chamber of Horrors.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.291
Do you enjoy
being frightened?

38:49.291 --> 38:51.958
( laughs )
I think it's delicious,

38:51.958 --> 38:53.875
so long as it's not
really happening.

38:53.875 --> 38:55.791
Maybe we can go there
one afternoon.

38:55.791 --> 38:57.333
Dr. Chickering,
I need you.

38:59.083 --> 39:00.708
It's a previa case.

39:00.708 --> 39:04.000
I need a doctor
to order the patient
into surgery immediately.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.750
- Mrs...
- Lefkowitz.

39:06.750 --> 39:08.416
Lefkowitz.
Look up, please,
Mrs. Lefkowitz.

39:08.416 --> 39:09.791
Great.
Thank you.

39:09.791 --> 39:11.291
How long have you
been in labor?

39:11.291 --> 39:13.291
Since 8:00
this morning.

39:13.291 --> 39:15.666
I just need you
to order her into surgery.

39:15.666 --> 39:17.041
I'm not allowed to.

39:17.041 --> 39:21.208
You're wasting time,
Bertie.

39:21.208 --> 39:22.333
( whimpering )

39:25.208 --> 39:27.416
Nurse Elkins,
fetch Dr. Thackery.

39:27.416 --> 39:30.041
Tell him we have
an extreme case of previa.

39:30.041 --> 39:32.416
( breathing heavily )

39:33.625 --> 39:34.291
Where's Gallinger?

39:34.291 --> 39:35.583
No one's seen him.

39:35.583 --> 39:38.541
Then tell Dr. Chickering
he'll be assisting.

39:47.750 --> 39:50.000
( sink running )

39:52.333 --> 39:55.000
We ready?
Patient all prepped?

39:55.000 --> 39:56.708
Of course.

39:56.708 --> 39:58.125
( clears throat )

39:58.125 --> 40:00.500
You look a tad
rattled, Bertie.

40:00.500 --> 40:02.000
I wasn't eager to see
another previa patient

40:02.000 --> 40:05.416
after Dr. Christiansen.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.458
Listen to me.

40:08.458 --> 40:10.166
Christiansen was brilliant,
but he froze.

40:10.166 --> 40:11.708
You know,
he lost his nerve.

40:11.708 --> 40:13.208
We won't.

40:13.208 --> 40:15.583
We make
a bigger incision.

40:15.583 --> 40:18.083
We have the electric
cauterizer, which is faster.

40:18.083 --> 40:21.500
We can save this mother.
We can save this child.

40:21.500 --> 40:22.333
We can do this.

40:30.041 --> 40:32.250
( clock ticking )

40:47.916 --> 40:49.708
How long?

40:51.833 --> 40:53.958
Bertie:
 72 seconds.

40:56.541 --> 40:59.666
I don't think
anybody could have
done it faster.

41:02.416 --> 41:04.916
We did everything right.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.208
( baby crying )

41:39.333 --> 41:42.833
Did you hear about
the Gallingers?

41:42.833 --> 41:45.416
Little Lillian's sick.

41:45.416 --> 41:47.833
Her head's at
an unusual angle

41:47.833 --> 41:50.000
and there's a slight
swelling of the forehead.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.333
We think it's meningitis.

41:52.333 --> 41:55.458
How the hell was she
exposed to that?

41:55.458 --> 41:59.000
Everett had a patient
with multiple rat bites.

42:13.208 --> 42:16.000
Just another Tuesday
at the Knick.

42:43.750 --> 42:45.958
It's a beauty,
isn't it?

42:49.541 --> 42:51.208
It's called a Rambler.

42:51.208 --> 42:54.500
First thing I did
when I moved here,

42:54.500 --> 42:56.125
even before I found
a place to stay,
was to buy it.

42:58.791 --> 42:59.791
Comes in five colors.

42:59.791 --> 43:02.750
And you chose blue.

43:02.750 --> 43:04.375
I did.

43:04.375 --> 43:06.416
To match your eyes.

43:08.041 --> 43:10.541
I like riding
in the city.

43:10.541 --> 43:13.125
Makes me feel
like I'm part of it.

43:13.125 --> 43:14.958
I saw you on it
this morning.

43:14.958 --> 43:17.458
You didn't look like
you were part of anything.

43:17.458 --> 43:19.333
You looked free.

43:21.083 --> 43:22.333
I quite envied you that.

43:24.083 --> 43:26.791
Can you ride a bicycle?

43:26.791 --> 43:30.291
Is it like riding a horse?
I can ride a horse.

43:30.291 --> 43:31.916
Not in the least.

43:31.916 --> 43:35.083
Then, no, I can't.

43:35.083 --> 43:37.541
Then let me teach you.

43:44.125 --> 43:45.666
( laughs )

43:45.666 --> 43:46.875
It's harder than
it looks at first,

43:46.875 --> 43:49.083
but it's the easiest
thing in the world.

43:49.083 --> 43:52.125
Hence the saying,
it's as easy as falling
off a bicycle.

43:54.166 --> 43:56.833
You're thinking
too much.

43:56.833 --> 43:58.708
Why don't you try
singing a song?

43:58.708 --> 44:00.375
It'll help
distract you.

44:00.375 --> 44:01.208
A song?

44:08.625 --> 44:11.458
( humming, laughing )

44:17.625 --> 44:19.166
Turn to the side.
You're falling.

44:23.708 --> 44:27.583
âª Boys and girls
together âª

44:27.583 --> 44:30.208
âª Me and Mamie O'Rourke âª

44:30.208 --> 44:32.208
âª Boys and girls
together âª

44:34.875 --> 44:37.625
âª Boys and girls
together âª

44:37.625 --> 44:41.041
( laughs )
âª Me and Mamie O'Rourke âª

44:41.041 --> 44:44.416
âª The light fantastic
on the-- âª

44:48.125 --> 44:49.250
You're a good teacher.

44:51.083 --> 44:52.625
You're a good student.

44:55.375 --> 44:58.625
