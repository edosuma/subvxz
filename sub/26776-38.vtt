How's the Omega Weapon coming?
- Almost done.

20:31.830 --> 20:35.167
{\an5}Just waiting for your dad
to come back with
the shellgon crystals.

20:35.233 --> 20:37.603
- My dad?
- Yeah I know...

20:37.669 --> 20:39.671
- You sent my dad
to get shellgon crystals?!

20:39.738 --> 20:41.139
- Yeah it's been a big day.

20:41.206 --> 20:42.641
- Woa, woa, woa,
wait, wait, wait.

20:42.708 --> 20:44.376
The shellgon crystals?!

20:44.443 --> 20:47.012
The ones under
the right tube pad?

20:47.079 --> 20:48.280
Right next to
the iridium crystals

20:48.347 --> 20:49.615
under the left tube pad?!

20:49.681 --> 20:51.984
- Yes.
- But Schwoz always told me...

20:52.050 --> 20:53.819
{\an5}[ imitates Schwoz ]
The iridium crystals regulate
the power source

20:53.885 --> 20:56.788
for the tube system that runs
through all the Man Caves.

20:56.855 --> 20:58.056
If they get removed--

20:58.123 --> 20:59.257
- It could be bad.

20:59.324 --> 21:00.892
[ imitates Schwoz ]
- Real bad.

21:00.959 --> 21:03.829
{\an5}[ clears throat
and says in regular voice ]
Real bad.

21:03.895 --> 21:04.896
Hi.

21:04.963 --> 21:06.898
- Like, how bad?

21:06.965 --> 21:08.233
- Like it could cause
a chain reaction

21:08.300 --> 21:10.535
that could blow up
every single Man Cave.

21:10.602 --> 21:12.070
- And you sent my dad?!

21:12.137 --> 21:13.472
- It's been a big day!

21:13.538 --> 21:15.607
- You could have probably sent
anybody else!

21:20.479 --> 21:21.980
- Woa woa woa. Here he is.
Here he is. Here he is.

21:22.047 --> 21:25.951
- Anyone order some crystals?

21:26.018 --> 21:28.720
- Ummm. Where did you get those?

21:28.787 --> 21:31.223
- These lil' guys?

21:31.289 --> 21:33.358
From the right tube pad.

21:33.425 --> 21:35.661
[ everyone breathes
a sign of relief ]

21:35.727 --> 21:37.496
{\an5}- Thank you. That's great.
- I knew it was
going to be alright.

21:37.562 --> 21:39.197
{\an8}- I knew he'd do it.

21:39.264 --> 21:42.000
{\an8}- But I also took these lil'
girls from the left tube pad.

21:42.067 --> 21:44.770
{\an8}Just to be safe.
