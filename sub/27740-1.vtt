<i>This was</i>

01:07.275 --> 01:09.695

01:09.737 --> 01:13.365
<i>out of about</i>

01:09.737 --> 01:13.365

01:16.702 --> 01:19.204
I haven't seen it all yet,

01:16.702 --> 01:19.204
but...

01:20.915 --> 01:23.166
this one still seemed

01:20.915 --> 01:23.166
different.

01:24.167 --> 01:27.046
Maybe it was how far it went.

01:27.086 --> 01:29.631
Now, you never know

01:27.086 --> 01:29.631
how these situations

01:29.673 --> 01:31.717
if they will end in violence.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.761
But that threat of harm,

01:31.759 --> 01:33.761
that terror

01:33.802 --> 01:35.512
that the victim

01:33.802 --> 01:35.512
is made to live with,

01:35.554 --> 01:37.556
that's always there.

01:39.307 --> 01:41.685
And suddenly one day...

01:43.102 --> 01:44.312
boom.

02:00.037 --> 02:01.872

02:08.461 --> 02:09.797
Submit.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.634
Oh. Tommy, I'm so sorry.

02:13.675 --> 02:16.136
Uh, I'm gonna be there

02:13.675 --> 02:16.136
as soon as I can. I just...

02:18.305 --> 02:20.849
No, don't call Cherise in!

02:18.305 --> 02:20.849
I'm...

02:20.891 --> 02:23.310
I'm literally

02:20.891 --> 02:23.310
right down the street.

02:24.603 --> 02:26.647
No, I promise

02:24.603 --> 02:26.647
I'm really almost there.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.941
- Honestly, like, 30 seconds.

02:28.983 --> 02:31.110
This time, I me...

02:28.983 --> 02:31.110
Oh, shit. Okay.

02:31.151 --> 02:34.947
Um, hey, Tommy,

02:31.151 --> 02:34.947
I gotta go, but I...

02:34.989 --> 02:36.657
I'm gonna be right there.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.283
Don't call Cherise

02:36.698 --> 02:38.283
or anything else.

02:48.043 --> 02:50.963
I'm sorry, Chief Dodd.

02:48.043 --> 02:50.963
I'm at your mercy again.

02:53.090 --> 02:56.677
- Oh, you're not Chief Dodd.

02:53.090 --> 02:56.677
- Nope.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.762
- Officer Barragan.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.762
- Officer Barragan.

02:58.804 --> 03:00.221
- Right. You're the new guy.

02:58.804 --> 03:00.221
- Mm-hmm.

03:00.263 --> 03:01.598
So you're probably

03:00.263 --> 03:01.598
not gonna let me off

03:01.640 --> 03:02.808
with my usual warning

03:01.640 --> 03:02.808
then, right?

03:02.850 --> 03:04.768
'Cause, I mean, why would you?

03:04.810 --> 03:06.895
You know how fast

03:04.810 --> 03:06.895
you were going?

03:07.729 --> 03:10.107
- Too fast?

03:07.729 --> 03:10.107
- Too fast.

03:10.149 --> 03:12.151
And you were talking

03:10.149 --> 03:12.151
on your cell phone.

03:12.191 --> 03:13.318
Mm.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.653
Where you headed

03:13.360 --> 03:14.653
in such a hurry?

03:14.695 --> 03:16.404
Uh, the James' Center.

03:16.446 --> 03:17.739
- I work there.

03:16.446 --> 03:17.739
- Oh, okay.

03:17.781 --> 03:19.366
- Yeah.

03:17.781 --> 03:19.366
- Where is that?

03:19.407 --> 03:21.743
It's right up the corner.

03:19.407 --> 03:21.743
I'm headed to work.

03:21.785 --> 03:24.038
Okay. Good to know.

03:24.079 --> 03:26.247
We have the world's best pie.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.083
Also good to know.

03:28.125 --> 03:29.543
All right, Julie.

03:30.669 --> 03:32.420
How did, how do you know

03:30.669 --> 03:32.420
my name?

03:32.462 --> 03:34.048
Well, chief, he, uh,

03:32.462 --> 03:34.048
gave me a heads-up

03:34.089 --> 03:37.051
on some of the town's more

03:34.089 --> 03:37.051
reckless citizens

03:37.092 --> 03:38.593
and their routes.

03:38.635 --> 03:40.012
I was expecting you.

03:40.054 --> 03:41.471
So, here's what I'm gonna do.

03:41.513 --> 03:43.015
I'm gonna do

03:41.513 --> 03:43.015
what the chief would do here.

03:43.057 --> 03:44.683
Julie Dillon,

03:44.725 --> 03:46.351
consider this a verbal warning.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.187
Well, thank you, sir.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.437
You're welcome.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.023
Just do me a favor, slow down,

03:51.065 --> 03:52.900
keep both hands on the wheel.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.484
If you're not careful,

03:52.941 --> 03:54.484
you'll fly into a ditch

03:54.526 --> 03:56.361
or kill somebody.

03:56.403 --> 03:59.073
I promise you, I will do

03:56.403 --> 03:59.073
neither of those things.

03:59.114 --> 04:00.157
Okay.

04:00.199 --> 04:02.283
- Thank you.

04:00.199 --> 04:02.283
- Thank you.

Okay, so you guys

04:31.021 --> 04:32.606
got your food.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.149
Um, you need the... What was it?

04:34.191 --> 04:35.400
Hash browns and toast?

04:35.442 --> 04:36.902
And then anything else?

04:38.070 --> 04:40.114
- Order up!

04:43.366 --> 04:45.368
Hey, you still owe me

04:43.366 --> 04:45.368
hash browns and toast.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.121
You don't have 'em, probably

04:45.410 --> 04:47.121
'cause you didn't write it down.

04:47.162 --> 04:49.081
Check your tickets. Table four.

04:50.331 --> 04:51.625
Oh, come on.

04:52.709 --> 04:56.379
So, since Tommy can't

04:52.709 --> 04:56.379
get it together,

04:56.421 --> 04:59.049
hash browns and toast on him,

04:56.421 --> 04:59.049
coffee's on me.

04:59.091 --> 05:00.675
- Thank you.

04:59.091 --> 05:00.675
- Hey!

05:00.717 --> 05:03.011
- At least I was on time, okay?

05:00.717 --> 05:03.011
- Ha-ha.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.143
- Good morning, Evelyn.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.143
- Hey.

05:09.184 --> 05:11.103
- What do you have for me?

05:09.184 --> 05:11.103
- Uh...

05:11.145 --> 05:13.021
Let me see here. Ah!

05:13.063 --> 05:16.817
Okay. A ten-letter word

05:13.063 --> 05:16.817
for "freedom."

05:16.858 --> 05:19.194
The, the third letter's a B.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.739
Liberation?

05:22.781 --> 05:24.992
Look at you. You are ready

05:22.781 --> 05:24.992
for college.

05:25.033 --> 05:28.328
Even though you can leave the

05:25.033 --> 05:28.328
rest of us behind, it's fine.

05:28.369 --> 05:30.164
I may be "liberated"

05:28.369 --> 05:30.164
from this town,

05:30.205 --> 05:31.248
but I could never leave you.

05:31.290 --> 05:33.834
Mm. By the way,

05:33.875 --> 05:36.211
there's some extra

05:33.875 --> 05:36.211
in there this week.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.797
I won 50 bucks

05:36.253 --> 05:38.797
in the scratch-off.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.174
I can't take that.

05:40.215 --> 05:43.093
Yes, you can, and you will.

05:40.215 --> 05:43.093
Go. Go.

05:59.651 --> 06:01.402
So, I don't know

06:01.444 --> 06:04.531
what you're up to tonight

06:01.444 --> 06:04.531
but, um...

06:04.572 --> 06:06.074
so, me and the boys

06:04.572 --> 06:06.074
are heading to Lucky's

06:06.116 --> 06:08.618
to play some pool and...

06:08.660 --> 06:11.121
I don't know if you...

06:11.163 --> 06:12.497
want to go.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.124
That's nice. Sounds fun.

06:14.166 --> 06:16.960
Sensing a "but"

06:14.166 --> 06:16.960
coming on its way.

06:17.002 --> 06:19.880
It's inappropriate to talk

06:17.002 --> 06:19.880
about "butts" in the workplace.

06:22.341 --> 06:25.177
What? No...

06:22.341 --> 06:25.177
No, no, no. I-I wasn't--

06:25.219 --> 06:27.304
Gotcha.

06:27.346 --> 06:31.308
Um, I can't tonight.

06:31.350 --> 06:33.810
I have a thing

06:31.350 --> 06:33.810
with Kinsey and Suzanne and...

06:35.187 --> 06:37.272
Lucky's sounds fun though.

06:38.357 --> 06:42.236
Cool. That's, uh...

06:38.357 --> 06:42.236
That's awesome.

06:42.277 --> 06:44.571
Maybe another time.

06:42.277 --> 06:44.571
I like pool.

07:05.092 --> 07:08.303
[indistinct song

07:15.852 --> 07:18.272
Hello, Officer Barragan.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.190
Don't tell me that you changed

07:18.313 --> 07:20.190
your mind about letting me go.

07:20.232 --> 07:21.900
- Am I under arrest?

07:20.232 --> 07:21.900
- Nope.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.903
While you are clearly a danger

07:21.942 --> 07:24.903
to yourself and others,

07:24.945 --> 07:26.571
I'm just here to inspect

07:24.945 --> 07:26.571
the pie, ma'am.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.407
It is really good.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.117
I'll be the judge of that.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.577
Do you have a preference?

07:32.619 --> 07:35.289
I'll have whatever you think

07:32.619 --> 07:35.289
I should have.

07:35.330 --> 07:36.497
Coming right up.

07:46.300 --> 07:47.508
So...

07:47.550 --> 07:49.219
with you being new in town

07:47.550 --> 07:49.219
and all,

07:49.261 --> 07:51.846
I figured you might want

07:49.261 --> 07:51.846
somebody to...

07:53.098 --> 07:54.474
I don't know, show you around?

07:55.892 --> 07:58.478
Are you asking me out

07:55.892 --> 07:58.478
on a date, Julie Dillon?

08:00.730 --> 08:02.357
Friday night.

08:02.399 --> 08:04.443
I don't know.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.278
A criminal and a cop?

08:06.320 --> 08:08.947
- People might talk.

08:09.448 --> 08:10.657
Let 'em.

08:14.035 --> 08:15.245
Friday night.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.129
Yeah, we were close.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.631
But, you know, when,

08:24.171 --> 08:26.631
when David showed up,

08:26.673 --> 08:29.050
it... changed things.

08:29.884 --> 08:32.346
How so?

08:32.386 --> 08:35.056
I, you know, I just felt

08:32.386 --> 08:35.056
things were different.

08:35.097 --> 08:38.643
She liked him,

08:35.097 --> 08:38.643
and what do I know?

08:38.684 --> 08:40.687
She was happy.

08:40.727 --> 08:42.856
Did you like her?

08:44.316 --> 08:46.651
<i>I mean,</i>

08:44.316 --> 08:46.651
<i>who didn't like Julie?</i>

08:48.611 --> 08:51.198
- Hey! I'm so sorry.

08:48.611 --> 08:51.198
- Hey-hey!

08:51.239 --> 08:53.408
I couldn't get my till

08:51.239 --> 08:53.408
to close out at work

08:53.450 --> 08:55.452
and it was this whole thing,

08:53.450 --> 08:55.452
so...

08:55.494 --> 08:56.703
We'll see if I have a job

08:55.494 --> 08:56.703
tomorrow.

08:56.744 --> 08:58.413
I am sure you're fine.

08:59.414 --> 09:01.375
Got you little somethin'.

09:03.584 --> 09:06.087
Doesn't look like much but, uh,

09:06.129 --> 09:08.382
turn that, that's that, yeah.

09:12.135 --> 09:14.054
- Thank you.

09:12.135 --> 09:14.054
- You're welcome.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.761
Isn't that the guy

09:53.093 --> 09:54.761
you work with?

09:54.802 --> 09:56.304
Yeah.

09:56.346 --> 09:59.057
He was watching you

09:56.346 --> 09:59.057
during the show, you know?

09:59.099 --> 10:02.227
- Pretty intense.

09:59.099 --> 10:02.227
- Well, that's just Tommy.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.479
- Just Tommy, huh?

10:05.522 --> 10:06.814
Yeah. Now, where were we?

10:06.856 --> 10:09.943
No, but, you don't

10:06.856 --> 10:09.943
like him, right?

10:09.984 --> 10:12.195
What? No!

10:12.237 --> 10:14.364
God, no.

10:14.406 --> 10:16.533
'Cause I like you, Julie.

10:14.406 --> 10:16.533
I do.

10:16.575 --> 10:20.203
Yeah? But do you "like me"

10:16.575 --> 10:20.203
like me?

10:20.245 --> 10:22.622
I just said I like you.

10:22.663 --> 10:25.459
Wait, are you letting me

10:22.663 --> 10:25.459
in here?

10:25.500 --> 10:27.294
Uh...

10:27.335 --> 10:30.255
Look, my last

10:27.335 --> 10:30.255
relationship was

10:30.297 --> 10:31.881
really dysfunctional.

10:31.923 --> 10:34.426
- So...

10:31.923 --> 10:34.426
- Someone from around here?

10:34.468 --> 10:37.429
No. Uh, East Larson.

10:34.468 --> 10:37.429
Where I used to live.

10:37.471 --> 10:39.889
Oh. What's her name?

10:39.931 --> 10:43.017
Alicia. But I don't

10:39.931 --> 10:43.017
wanna talk about her.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.313
David, I'm not her.

10:46.354 --> 10:47.564
I know.

10:47.606 --> 10:49.690
I just wanna be...

10:49.732 --> 10:52.444
open about everything.

10:52.486 --> 10:54.654
You know, this,

10:52.486 --> 10:54.654
whatever this is,

10:54.695 --> 10:58.617
I... I want it to be right.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.833
I don't know what to say.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.833
I like you.

11:14.673 --> 11:16.801
<i>You know...</i>

11:16.843 --> 11:20.472
Navajo myth talks

11:16.843 --> 11:20.472
about resisting meanness.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.850
That was Julie growing up.

11:25.393 --> 11:27.979
Not a mean bone in her.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.231
Did she date a lot

11:28.021 --> 11:30.231
before this happened?

11:32.317 --> 11:35.195
I was always happy

11:32.317 --> 11:35.195
when she found someone.

11:37.447 --> 11:38.906
Truly.

11:38.948 --> 11:41.951
<i>For the first time</i>

11:38.948 --> 11:41.951
<i>since her father died,</i>

11:41.993 --> 11:44.245
<i>her life was</i>

11:41.993 --> 11:44.245
<i>in perfect harmony.</i>

11:44.287 --> 11:46.122
- And he was like--

11:44.287 --> 11:46.122
- Okay, okay.

11:46.164 --> 11:48.375
- N-n-no, don't say it.

11:46.164 --> 11:48.375
- No, no, no, no...

11:48.416 --> 11:49.792
And he was just like,

11:49.834 --> 11:51.461
"Today, I want

11:51.503 --> 11:53.171
whatever you think

11:51.503 --> 11:53.171
I should have."

11:53.213 --> 11:55.048
- Oh!

11:55.089 --> 11:56.924
So I brought him

11:55.089 --> 11:56.924
the lemon meringue pie.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.717
- That was some good pie.

11:58.759 --> 12:01.555
- I think that's sweet.

12:01.596 --> 12:03.264
I'm happy to see that Julie's

12:03.306 --> 12:05.183
finally with a guy

12:03.306 --> 12:05.183
who respects her opinion.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.186
Ay, Mom, can we please

12:05.225 --> 12:08.186
not talk about that?

12:09.896 --> 12:11.898
Who is this?

12:11.939 --> 12:14.775
Nobody. It's...

12:11.939 --> 12:14.775
Just forget about it.

12:14.817 --> 12:17.153
He just wasn't

12:14.817 --> 12:17.153
right for you.

12:18.737 --> 12:20.490
- Sorry, David.

12:18.737 --> 12:20.490
- No, no.

12:20.532 --> 12:22.534
I can handle it.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.661
Guess I'll just have to

12:22.576 --> 12:24.661
step up my game.

12:24.703 --> 12:27.121
I guess you will.

12:31.710 --> 12:33.712
- Where are we?

12:31.710 --> 12:33.712
- Trust me.

12:33.752 --> 12:35.714
It's worth the drive.

12:41.344 --> 12:43.597
Wow, this place is amazing.

12:50.395 --> 12:51.688
Is this real?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.691
You bet.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.693
It's my grandfather's

12:54.733 --> 12:56.693
old hunting rifle.

12:56.735 --> 12:58.819
Wow. Huh.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.700
Here. Oh.

13:03.742 --> 13:06.077
Spilled some. One second.

13:09.664 --> 13:12.917
Everything in here

13:09.664 --> 13:12.917
is so masculine.

13:12.959 --> 13:16.755
It makes me wanna wear flannel

13:12.959 --> 13:16.755
and chop down trees.

13:16.795 --> 13:18.298
I could see that.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.925
The sexiest lumberjack

13:18.339 --> 13:20.925
to ever walk these woods.

13:22.636 --> 13:24.554
Oh!

13:24.596 --> 13:26.389
Is this you?

13:29.142 --> 13:31.810
It is! You were adorable.

13:34.522 --> 13:37.609
Oh, I can't believe

13:34.522 --> 13:37.609
that you were right here,

13:37.651 --> 13:40.111
and I never met you.

13:44.574 --> 13:47.201
- What?

13:44.574 --> 13:47.201
- Nothing.

13:48.244 --> 13:49.912
What is it?

13:54.083 --> 13:56.419
I'm really happy with you.

13:56.461 --> 13:59.464
Seeing these photos,

13:56.461 --> 13:59.464
it always reminds me of them.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.469
What? Your parents?

14:02.300 --> 14:04.469
They look nice.

14:05.219 --> 14:06.387
Yeah.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.349
I didn't mean to pry.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.976
No, it's, it's okay.

14:16.272 --> 14:18.441
Is this at the cabin?

14:18.483 --> 14:20.193
Yeah.

14:20.234 --> 14:22.529
My mom stopped coming

14:20.234 --> 14:22.529
a couple years after this,

14:22.570 --> 14:25.323
but my dad and I came

14:22.570 --> 14:25.323
every summer.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.742
Spend some time

14:25.365 --> 14:27.742
with the chief and his family...

14:28.951 --> 14:31.245
till my dad died.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.542
I'm sorry.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.128
My dad was the best.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.341
After he died,

14:40.380 --> 14:43.341
my mom kinda checked out,

14:43.383 --> 14:45.051
but she'd still send me up here

14:45.092 --> 14:47.303
to spend time

14:45.092 --> 14:47.303
with the chief and his family.

14:47.345 --> 14:49.723
Get rid of me for the summer.

14:49.764 --> 14:51.974
- Chief Dodd?

14:49.764 --> 14:51.974
- Yeah.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.976
Then when she passed,

14:54.018 --> 14:56.730
the cabin went to me.

14:56.771 --> 14:58.773
Here we are.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.654
Thank you for telling me that.

15:04.696 --> 15:06.947
Thank you for listening.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.791
- Oh.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.791
- Who's that?

15:16.833 --> 15:19.168
I'm sorry. I didn't know

15:16.833 --> 15:19.168
that was in there.

15:19.210 --> 15:22.338
Is that... her?

15:22.380 --> 15:23.964
Uh, Alicia?

15:26.217 --> 15:27.761
It is, right?

15:29.679 --> 15:31.681
Look, it's okay.

15:33.433 --> 15:36.603
Everybody has stuff

15:33.433 --> 15:36.603
in their past.

15:36.644 --> 15:39.980
Even the sexiest lumberjack

15:36.644 --> 15:39.980
to walk these woods

15:40.022 --> 15:42.525
has made a mistake or two.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.861
She was definitely a mistake.

15:44.903 --> 15:47.071
Things didn't end well for us.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.657
She was hung up on somebody else

15:47.113 --> 15:49.657
the whole time we were dating.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.952
It messed me up.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.914
You know what's not a mistake?

15:55.955 --> 15:57.749
What's that?

15:57.791 --> 15:59.834
This beer...

15:59.876 --> 16:02.044
this boy...

16:02.086 --> 16:03.546
and this place.

16:03.588 --> 16:06.090
I guess it is pretty good.

16:06.132 --> 16:08.301
You know, you never

16:06.132 --> 16:08.301
gave me a tour.

16:08.342 --> 16:10.845
- I can do that.

16:08.342 --> 16:10.845
- Actually, no.

16:10.887 --> 16:14.307
- Feeling a little dizzy.

16:10.887 --> 16:14.307
- Okay.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.768
Think I might need

16:14.348 --> 16:16.768
to lie down,

16:16.810 --> 16:18.185
if that's okay.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.939
- Okay.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.939
- If that's okay.

16:29.656 --> 16:32.032
Well, if you're dizzy,

16:32.074 --> 16:33.367
come here, lumberjane.

16:33.409 --> 16:36.036
- Whoa!

16:33.409 --> 16:36.036
- Take you in here.

16:38.623 --> 16:41.542
<i>Coldwater Hills</i>

16:38.623 --> 16:41.542
<i>is a small town.</i>

16:43.336 --> 16:45.797
<i>A town where everyone</i>

16:43.336 --> 16:45.797
<i>knows everyone.</i>

16:45.839 --> 16:48.299
Anytown, USA?

16:48.341 --> 16:51.177
That depends on

16:48.341 --> 16:51.177
where you grew up.

16:51.218 --> 16:53.346
You know, it's as messed up as,

16:53.387 --> 16:55.389
as any town.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.477
You know, if you change

16:57.350 --> 16:59.477
your mind and wanted

16:59.519 --> 17:01.771
to do an Xbox and beer night,

16:59.519 --> 17:01.771
the offer still stands.

17:01.813 --> 17:04.983
Just two friends

17:01.813 --> 17:04.983
on a very platonic,

17:05.023 --> 17:09.069
non-weird,

17:05.023 --> 17:09.069
not-at-all-awkward

17:05.023 --> 17:09.069
hangout sesh, okay?

17:10.029 --> 17:11.280
Thank you.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.672
Have a good night.

18:07.837 --> 18:09.672
Julie. Hey.

18:09.714 --> 18:12.258
Hi! Hey, what are you

18:09.714 --> 18:12.258
doing here?

18:12.299 --> 18:15.261
I thought you got off work

18:12.299 --> 18:15.261
at 4:00.

18:15.302 --> 18:17.680
Yeah, but, like,

18:15.302 --> 18:17.680
how did you get in?

18:17.722 --> 18:20.600
I was worried about you,

18:17.722 --> 18:20.600
so I wanted to stop by.

18:20.641 --> 18:23.603
Oh. Yeah, I just had

18:20.641 --> 18:23.603
to deposit something

18:23.644 --> 18:25.646
before the bank closed.

18:25.688 --> 18:26.898
Um...

18:28.107 --> 18:30.234
I think we need to talk

18:28.107 --> 18:30.234
about Tommy.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.780
Okay, what about him?

18:33.821 --> 18:35.573
I think you need

18:33.821 --> 18:35.573
to keep an eye on him.

18:35.615 --> 18:38.409
Something about him just

18:35.615 --> 18:38.409
doesn't feel right.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.955
I wanted to make sure

18:39.786 --> 18:41.955
you were okay.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.083
- Yes.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.083
- Yeah?

18:45.124 --> 18:47.001
- Yeah, I'm, I'm good.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.001
- Good.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.757
Oh. Well, hello.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.509
What a nice surprise.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.509
Thank you, David.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.971
- What are you kids up to?

18:55.551 --> 18:57.971
- Uh, I just got home.

18:58.012 --> 19:01.724
Yeah, we're just gonna

18:58.012 --> 19:01.724
make plans later. Right?

19:01.766 --> 19:04.102
Wanna take this all

19:01.766 --> 19:04.102
the way to the kitchen for me?

19:04.143 --> 19:06.312
- I think I could do that.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.312
- Thank you.

19:06.353 --> 19:07.647
All right.

19:09.857 --> 19:11.734
<i>Did you ever say</i>

19:09.857 --> 19:11.734
<i>anything to her?</i>

19:11.776 --> 19:13.694
About David?

19:13.736 --> 19:15.863
No. No, never.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.573
It was never my place.

19:17.615 --> 19:19.867
Do you wish you had?

19:21.953 --> 19:25.832
I think, I think she

19:21.953 --> 19:25.832
figured that out eventually.

19:31.712 --> 19:32.839
Hey,

19:31.712 --> 19:32.839
thanks for, uh, watching

19:32.880 --> 19:34.173
the little rugrat tonight.

19:34.214 --> 19:35.508
Hope I'm not keeping you

19:34.214 --> 19:35.508
from your own

19:35.549 --> 19:37.969
scandalous pursuits with David.

19:38.011 --> 19:40.888
Gosh. I'm just lucky to have

19:38.011 --> 19:40.888
some time with this little one.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.266
You okay, kiddo?

19:44.308 --> 19:45.309
She's been this little

19:45.351 --> 19:46.686
ray of sunshine all day.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.729
And here's the fun part--

19:46.727 --> 19:48.729
no explanation.

19:48.771 --> 19:50.397
Yay!

19:51.732 --> 19:54.234
Did something happen?

19:54.276 --> 19:56.570
Mm, this boy at school is mean.

19:56.612 --> 19:59.448
He said I threw a rock,

19:56.612 --> 19:59.448
but I didn't throw a rock.

19:59.490 --> 20:01.450
No one believed me,

19:59.490 --> 20:01.450
they all believed him.

20:01.492 --> 20:03.536
- He always lies.

20:01.492 --> 20:03.536
- Who threw a rock?

20:03.577 --> 20:06.539
- Hey, you're not here, remember?

20:03.577 --> 20:06.539
- Fine. Not here.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.749
But I'll find out.

20:08.791 --> 20:11.127
Okay. Listen to me.

20:11.169 --> 20:15.131
Sometimes a boy like that,

20:11.169 --> 20:15.131
a boy who lies really well,

20:15.173 --> 20:19.052
no matter what, people are gonna

20:15.173 --> 20:19.052
believe him and not you.

20:19.093 --> 20:21.470
But, see, sooner or later,

20:19.093 --> 20:21.470
the truth is gonna come out

20:21.512 --> 20:23.139
because it always does.

20:23.181 --> 20:25.516
- Really?

20:23.181 --> 20:25.516
- Really.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.477
So someday you're gonna be able

20:25.558 --> 20:28.477
to look him in the eyes

20:28.519 --> 20:30.980
and say, "All the people

20:28.519 --> 20:30.980
that you fooled,

20:31.022 --> 20:32.356
they know that you are lying

20:32.398 --> 20:34.274
and they know

20:32.398 --> 20:34.274
I'm telling the truth."

20:34.316 --> 20:35.902
And that's gonna

20:34.316 --> 20:35.902
be super awesome.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.111
Awesome.

20:38.612 --> 20:40.614
Nice job stealing

20:38.612 --> 20:40.614
my parenting thunder.

20:40.656 --> 20:43.201
Okay.

20:40.656 --> 20:43.201
All right, kids. I'm out.

20:44.952 --> 20:47.413
- Have fun, Mommy.

20:44.952 --> 20:47.413
- I will. I love you.

20:47.454 --> 20:49.415
- Muah! I will.

20:47.454 --> 20:49.415
- Have fun.

20:49.456 --> 20:52.334
- Stay out as late as you want.

20:49.456 --> 20:52.334
- Oh! Okay.

20:55.213 --> 20:56.296
Okay, what's first?

20:56.338 --> 20:57.423
Doing our make-up

20:57.464 --> 20:58.716
or eating the 50 pounds of candy

20:58.758 --> 20:59.926
that I have in my purse?

20:59.967 --> 21:01.594
<i>♪ The 50 pounds</i>

20:59.967 --> 21:01.594
<i>of candy ♪</i>

21:01.635 --> 21:02.929
<i>♪ ...pounds of candy ♪</i>

21:02.970 --> 21:05.056
<i>♪ Fifty pounds of candy ♪</i>

21:05.098 --> 21:06.682
Okay.

21:29.872 --> 21:31.665
Julie?

21:36.295 --> 21:38.923
Hey. There's a sleeping

21:36.295 --> 21:38.923
little girl in here.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.216
Is everything okay?

21:41.217 --> 21:43.343
Didn't you see I called?

21:43.385 --> 21:46.055
Yeah, what,

21:43.385 --> 21:46.055
what are you doing here?

21:46.097 --> 21:48.390
You, you don't have

21:48.432 --> 21:49.976
any idea what I've been

21:48.432 --> 21:49.976
going through.

21:50.017 --> 21:52.145
Julie?

21:52.186 --> 21:54.272
Hey, why don't you go to bed,

21:52.186 --> 21:54.272
sweetie?

21:54.313 --> 21:55.815
I'll tuck you in in a second.

22:01.403 --> 22:03.948
What the hell is going on?

22:03.990 --> 22:06.492
- Everybody's been worried sick.

22:03.990 --> 22:06.492
- Everybody?

22:06.533 --> 22:08.161
What are you talking about?

22:08.202 --> 22:10.871
I thought we were supposed

22:08.202 --> 22:10.871
to be together tonight.

22:13.166 --> 22:16.085
- Oh, we had talked about it.

22:13.166 --> 22:16.085
- Yeah, we had talked about it.

22:16.127 --> 22:18.254
So when I didn't hear from you,

22:16.127 --> 22:18.254
I started to worry.

22:18.296 --> 22:19.922
And then I called your mother.

22:19.964 --> 22:22.300
My mother? What does my mother

22:19.964 --> 22:22.300
have to do with this?

22:22.341 --> 22:23.884
She said you would be here.

22:23.926 --> 22:27.387
But we couldn't reach you,

22:23.926 --> 22:27.387
so here I am.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.890
Is your phone off

22:27.429 --> 22:29.890
or something?

22:29.932 --> 22:32.101
Okay. Just come inside.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.610
How many times have you

22:39.900 --> 22:41.610
called and texted me?

22:41.652 --> 22:44.322
I was trying to get in touch

22:41.652 --> 22:44.322
with you, okay?

22:44.362 --> 22:45.739
When I didn't hear back,

22:44.362 --> 22:45.739
I-it made it worse.

22:45.781 --> 22:48.534
My mom has been calling me

22:45.781 --> 22:48.534
all night?

22:48.575 --> 22:50.536
You made us all

22:48.575 --> 22:50.536
very concerned about you.

22:50.577 --> 22:52.330
I'm babysitting

22:50.577 --> 22:52.330
for my best friend.

22:52.370 --> 22:54.207
Well, it would've been

22:52.370 --> 22:54.207
nice to know that.

22:54.248 --> 22:55.415
Anything could've

22:54.248 --> 22:55.415
happened to you.

22:55.457 --> 22:56.625
When you didn't answer,

22:56.667 --> 22:57.668
I, I thought maybe that Tommy--

22:57.710 --> 22:59.212
My phone ringer is off.

22:59.253 --> 23:00.713
That's not a crime.

23:09.638 --> 23:10.848
Hm...

23:19.940 --> 23:23.736
I always wanna be able

23:19.940 --> 23:23.736
to find you.

23:25.445 --> 23:27.365
- Why?

23:27.405 --> 23:30.117
- Why?

23:27.405 --> 23:30.117
- Hey, guys, what's up?

23:31.535 --> 23:33.579
Hey. Do you mind

23:31.535 --> 23:33.579
giving us a minute?

23:33.620 --> 23:35.664
We just really need

23:33.620 --> 23:35.664
to sort some things out.

23:35.706 --> 23:38.542
- No, I don't think so.

23:35.706 --> 23:38.542
- I...

23:38.584 --> 23:40.294
Okay. Then, then come with me.

23:40.336 --> 23:42.504
- No, I have to finish up here.

23:40.336 --> 23:42.504
- Mommy!

23:42.546 --> 23:45.174
Julie, look. Please.

23:45.216 --> 23:47.134
- I think you should just go.

23:45.216 --> 23:47.134
- Julie, stop.

23:47.176 --> 23:49.178
Okay? Think for a second.

23:47.176 --> 23:49.178
Think about what you're doing.

23:49.220 --> 23:51.138
- You just slow down.

23:49.220 --> 23:51.138
- Hold on, okay?

23:51.180 --> 23:53.807
Julie, just...

23:51.180 --> 23:53.807
Let's, let's start over.

23:53.849 --> 23:56.769
We can talk about it.

23:56.810 --> 24:00.189
But not right now,

23:56.810 --> 24:00.189
and really, really not here.

24:04.568 --> 24:05.778
Come on.

24:11.449 --> 24:12.701
Good night.

24:22.962 --> 24:26.299
Yeah, I guess

24:22.962 --> 24:26.299
I'm the brassy best friend.

24:26.340 --> 24:29.385
Straight talk.

24:26.340 --> 24:29.385
I take zero crap.

24:30.844 --> 24:32.012
Julie...

24:33.013 --> 24:34.390
not so much.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.560
And I'll never forgive myself

24:35.975 --> 24:38.560
for not pushing her

24:38.602 --> 24:40.562
to see it for what it was.

24:45.276 --> 24:48.321
I can't tell you how much

24:45.276 --> 24:48.321
I need this girls' night.

24:48.362 --> 24:50.030
<i>Have you</i>

24:48.362 --> 24:50.030
<i>heard from him?</i>

24:50.072 --> 24:52.325
He's being really sweet.

24:50.072 --> 24:52.325
He sent me flowers.

24:52.366 --> 24:54.368
<i>Ah.</i>

24:54.410 --> 24:57.788
I... feel bad, like...

24:57.830 --> 24:59.123
you know, maybe I screwed up.

24:59.165 --> 25:00.707
<i>It was</i>

24:59.165 --> 25:00.707
<i>not your fault,</i>

25:00.749 --> 25:03.377
<i>my little Indian princess,</i>

25:00.749 --> 25:03.377
<i>at all.</i>

25:03.419 --> 25:05.629
<i>So don't worry about it.</i>

25:06.630 --> 25:08.132
He's been texting me.

25:09.675 --> 25:11.260
I think maybe I should

25:09.675 --> 25:11.260
hear him out.

25:11.302 --> 25:14.013
What do you...

25:11.302 --> 25:14.013
think he's thinking?

25:14.054 --> 25:16.140
<i>You don't want</i>

25:14.054 --> 25:16.140
<i>my opinion on that.</i>

25:16.182 --> 25:18.058
<i>Okay. It was</i>

25:16.182 --> 25:18.058
<i>a bit much for me.</i>

25:18.100 --> 25:19.810
<i>That's all I'm gonna say.</i>

25:19.852 --> 25:21.561
<i>And be smart.</i>

25:21.603 --> 25:22.896
Yeah.

25:22.938 --> 25:25.483
I just think, you know,

25:22.938 --> 25:25.483
maybe, like,

25:25.523 --> 25:27.985
he was having a bad day or...

25:28.027 --> 25:30.570
there could've been

25:28.027 --> 25:30.570
something going on.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.984
Julie.

26:51.026 --> 26:52.903
Just wanted to talk.

26:55.155 --> 26:57.324
I wanted to explain

26:55.155 --> 26:57.324
the other night.

26:59.201 --> 27:01.412
Okay.

27:01.454 --> 27:05.165
I don't think you understand

27:01.454 --> 27:05.165
how much I care about you.

27:05.207 --> 27:07.376
I think about you

27:05.207 --> 27:07.376
all the time.

27:08.794 --> 27:12.423
Start over. Prove to you

27:08.794 --> 27:12.423
how much I care about you.

27:15.968 --> 27:20.180
Maybe we can go back out

27:15.968 --> 27:20.180
to the cabin again?

27:20.222 --> 27:23.809
- David--

27:20.222 --> 27:23.809
- Or... have a date night?

27:23.850 --> 27:27.187
I, uh...

27:23.850 --> 27:27.187
David, just don't.

27:31.484 --> 27:32.692
You promised me

27:31.484 --> 27:32.692
we would talk.

27:32.734 --> 27:34.612
We will, just not...

27:34.652 --> 27:36.654
right now and not here,

27:34.652 --> 27:36.654
right now--

27:36.696 --> 27:39.241
- Were you lying to me?

27:36.696 --> 27:39.241
- No.

27:39.283 --> 27:42.119
- No.

27:55.715 --> 27:58.010
Do you still wanna be

27:55.715 --> 27:58.010
with me?

28:00.346 --> 28:03.474
- Because...

28:00.346 --> 28:03.474
- Yeah.

28:03.516 --> 28:07.769
I think there is

28:03.516 --> 28:07.769
something powerful between us.

28:07.811 --> 28:11.190
And I know we're supposed to

28:07.811 --> 28:11.190
be together, you know?

28:11.231 --> 28:14.610
I just need you to understand me

28:11.231 --> 28:14.610
the way I understand you.

28:16.945 --> 28:19.865
- Yeah.

28:16.945 --> 28:19.865
- We all make mistakes.

28:19.906 --> 28:22.493
We occasionally hurt those

28:19.906 --> 28:22.493
that we love the most.

28:24.702 --> 28:26.872
I need you to know

28:24.702 --> 28:26.872
that I'm hurt.

28:29.249 --> 28:30.459
Okay.

28:31.335 --> 28:33.128
I understand...

28:38.842 --> 28:40.052
Good.

28:41.011 --> 28:42.762
Good.

28:43.472 --> 28:45.265
I'm glad we talked.

28:45.307 --> 28:48.768
Please just keep this little

28:45.307 --> 28:48.768
misunderstanding between us.

28:48.810 --> 28:51.689
In a town like this,

28:51.730 --> 28:53.857
people get the wrong idea.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.860
They start to talk.

28:56.902 --> 29:00.072
But this is just

28:56.902 --> 29:00.072
between us, okay?

29:06.828 --> 29:09.248
You look like a scared rabbit.

29:12.209 --> 29:14.002
Look, I'll, uh...

29:15.337 --> 29:17.172
I'll leave you alone.

29:17.214 --> 29:19.550
But we'll talk soon. Okay?

29:17.214 --> 29:19.550
I'll call you?

29:19.592 --> 29:20.759
Mm-hmm.

29:37.067 --> 29:40.404
<i>♪ I'm turnin' around</i>

29:50.330 --> 29:54.251

29:50.330 --> 29:54.251
- Mom... I, I, um...

29:57.296 --> 29:59.172
What's wrong?

29:59.214 --> 30:01.007
Hey, baby, are you okay?

30:01.049 --> 30:03.093
It's okay. I got you.

30:06.764 --> 30:08.098
It's David.

30:09.600 --> 30:12.770
I don't know

30:09.600 --> 30:12.770
what just happened.

30:13.979 --> 30:15.939
What happened?

30:15.981 --> 30:19.151
It was nothin'.

30:15.981 --> 30:19.151
What did she say?

30:19.192 --> 30:21.153
Her mother called it in.

30:21.194 --> 30:23.822
Well, did she actually

30:21.194 --> 30:23.822
report something?

30:23.863 --> 30:28.160
Why then were you hiding

30:23.863 --> 30:28.160
behind her shed?

30:28.201 --> 30:29.495
It was a private place

30:29.536 --> 30:32.164
and there was a garden

30:29.536 --> 30:32.164
in the back.

30:35.459 --> 30:37.503
Was there a rake?

30:37.544 --> 30:40.213
Um... yeah.

30:40.255 --> 30:42.508
There was a rake and a hose

30:40.255 --> 30:42.508
and a shovel

30:42.549 --> 30:44.510
and... everything else

30:42.549 --> 30:44.510
you would find

30:44.551 --> 30:46.094
in every garden

30:44.551 --> 30:46.094
within a 50 miles.

30:46.136 --> 30:47.346
So what?

30:50.683 --> 30:52.309
Look, she's upset.

30:52.351 --> 30:54.645
We had a good thing goin'.

30:54.687 --> 30:57.439
But we hit a rough patch.

30:54.687 --> 30:57.439
That's all.

31:02.235 --> 31:04.446
I feel bad for her.

31:10.952 --> 31:14.080
You know, I knew your dad

31:10.952 --> 31:14.080
a lot of years.

31:14.122 --> 31:16.458
And I knew when he was

31:14.122 --> 31:16.458
lying to me.

31:21.046 --> 31:23.298
You lying to me?

31:23.340 --> 31:26.176
You know me, Chief.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.094
I wouldn't lie to you.

31:28.136 --> 31:31.390
She's just... off.

31:32.015 --> 31:33.642
End of story.

31:48.699 --> 31:52.536
I'm sorry you had to

31:48.699 --> 31:52.536
deal with that. It's just...

31:52.578 --> 31:55.163
Believe me, I can tell you

31:52.578 --> 31:55.163
stories about Julie Dillon.

31:55.205 --> 31:57.499
She is not worth it.

31:58.417 --> 32:00.753
I'll keep that in mind.

32:04.464 --> 32:06.800
You've known David

32:04.464 --> 32:06.800
for years?

32:06.842 --> 32:08.093
Yeah. You know?

32:08.134 --> 32:10.637
And I, uh, I knew his father

32:10.679 --> 32:12.514
for a lot longer than that.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.642
I promised him I'd,

32:15.684 --> 32:18.186
I'd look after his boy.

32:18.228 --> 32:19.813
And I did.

32:20.856 --> 32:22.775
What about Julie?

32:22.816 --> 32:24.443
What about her?

32:24.484 --> 32:26.278
After

32:24.484 --> 32:26.278
the incident behind the shed,

32:26.319 --> 32:28.614
you didn't put a stop to it.

32:29.989 --> 32:33.410
Is there a question

32:29.989 --> 32:33.410
in there or...

32:33.452 --> 32:36.162
What incident behind the shed?

32:36.204 --> 32:38.373
He cornered her

32:36.204 --> 32:38.373
with a rake.

32:38.415 --> 32:39.708
Did he?

32:41.752 --> 32:43.503
Did he?

32:43.545 --> 32:45.297
You see what I'm saying?

32:45.338 --> 32:47.340
We don't know.

32:48.174 --> 32:49.384
Look.

32:50.260 --> 32:52.805
Everything that happened...

32:52.846 --> 32:54.389
it's terrible...

32:56.308 --> 32:57.893
in hindsight...

32:59.185 --> 33:01.354
but at the time...

33:07.986 --> 33:10.363
No, I'm just pickin' up Kinsey

33:07.986 --> 33:10.363
for Suzanne.

33:10.405 --> 33:12.616
I actually barely

33:10.405 --> 33:12.616
made it on time.

33:13.617 --> 33:16.119
Well, I just submitted it.

33:16.161 --> 33:18.163
It may take more than a week.

33:18.204 --> 33:20.123
I'm not that amazing.

33:23.042 --> 33:25.838
Hey, I'm gonna

33:23.042 --> 33:25.838
call you back, okay?

33:25.879 --> 33:29.549
No, it's fine. Uh, I'll call...

33:25.879 --> 33:29.549
I love you.

33:31.426 --> 33:32.928
Hey, Tina,

33:31.426 --> 33:32.928
have you seen Kinsey?

33:32.970 --> 33:34.972
I thought someone

33:32.970 --> 33:34.972
picked her up already.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.306
Do you need me to call Suzanne?

33:36.348 --> 33:38.141
No, call the police.

33:36.348 --> 33:38.141
Right now, please.

33:39.559 --> 33:40.769
Kinsey?

33:41.520 --> 33:42.729
Kinsey?

33:43.355 --> 33:44.564
Kinsey?

33:45.315 --> 33:46.775
Kinsey!

33:47.192 --> 33:48.360
Kinsey!

33:48.902 --> 33:50.153
Kinsey!

33:50.570 --> 33:51.864
Kinsey!

33:52.865 --> 33:54.700
Julie!

34:04.167 --> 34:05.377
Hm.

34:10.047 --> 34:11.299
What are you doing here?

34:11.341 --> 34:13.802
I saw a lost girl,

34:11.341 --> 34:13.802
and I'm the police.

34:13.844 --> 34:16.679
It's my job to keep her safe

34:13.844 --> 34:16.679
until somebody shows up.

34:16.722 --> 34:19.224
- You were late.

34:16.722 --> 34:19.224
- Kinsey, come here.

34:19.264 --> 34:20.516
Honey,

34:19.264 --> 34:20.516
I'm sorry that I was late.

34:20.559 --> 34:21.726
- It's okay.

34:20.559 --> 34:21.726
- Yeah.

34:21.768 --> 34:23.268
We had a snack

34:21.768 --> 34:23.268
while we waited.

34:23.311 --> 34:25.688
- Right, Kinsey?

34:23.311 --> 34:25.688
- Mm-hmm.

34:25.731 --> 34:27.858
Please, I need to take her home.

34:28.650 --> 34:30.944
You seem upset.

34:30.985 --> 34:34.031
Honestly, I should

34:30.985 --> 34:34.031
be the one who's upset.

34:34.072 --> 34:37.283
Spreading rumors about me when

34:34.072 --> 34:37.283
we know I haven't done anything.

34:38.952 --> 34:40.913
Maybe you're

34:38.952 --> 34:40.913
havin' a tough time.

34:40.954 --> 34:42.748
Maybe that's why

34:40.954 --> 34:42.748
you're tellin' Mom lies,

34:42.789 --> 34:44.833
and you're late pickin' up

34:42.789 --> 34:44.833
your little friend.

34:46.835 --> 34:48.837
You know, it's a good thing

34:46.835 --> 34:48.837
I was around.

34:48.879 --> 34:51.757
Be a shame if a little girl

34:48.879 --> 34:51.757
went missing.

34:57.721 --> 34:59.973
Okay. Well, uh, let's have

34:57.721 --> 34:59.973
that talk real soon.

35:04.728 --> 35:07.313
Julie, wait up.

35:04.728 --> 35:07.313
What's goin' on?

35:07.355 --> 35:09.024
Will you please tell him

35:07.355 --> 35:09.024
to leave me alone?

35:09.066 --> 35:10.817
I need to take her home.

35:10.859 --> 35:12.193
Whoa!

35:12.945 --> 35:14.153
Julie.

35:20.243 --> 35:22.871
We gonna have

35:20.243 --> 35:22.871
a problem here, David?

35:22.913 --> 35:25.123
Look, I don't know

35:22.913 --> 35:25.123
what her issue is.

35:25.164 --> 35:27.584
I see a lost kid...

35:27.626 --> 35:29.878
Chief, I'm just

35:27.626 --> 35:29.878
doing my job, okay?

35:31.588 --> 35:33.757
I don't know what she thinks

35:31.588 --> 35:33.757
I was doing. I...

35:33.799 --> 35:35.092
I don't know what

35:33.799 --> 35:35.092
she's gonna say next.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.509
Stop. Stop talking.

35:36.551 --> 35:38.553
- You, come here.

35:36.551 --> 35:38.553
- Look.

35:38.595 --> 35:40.263
- Shh. Listen to me.

35:40.305 --> 35:43.266
Listen to me.

35:40.305 --> 35:43.266
You gotta play nice here.

35:43.308 --> 35:45.351
- I'm try--

35:43.308 --> 35:45.351
- I don't wanna hear it.

35:45.393 --> 35:47.228
You're done talking.

35:47.270 --> 35:49.564
She's a nice girl.

35:47.270 --> 35:49.564
I get that.

35:49.606 --> 35:52.109
But whatever you two had

35:49.606 --> 35:52.109
is long gone.

35:53.735 --> 35:56.321
Now, I need you to just

35:53.735 --> 35:56.321
stay the hell away from her.

35:56.362 --> 35:58.698
All right?

35:56.362 --> 35:58.698
Stay away from her.

35:58.740 --> 36:00.325
And this will all blow over.

36:00.366 --> 36:02.619
- I was trying to, Chief.

36:00.366 --> 36:02.619
- I don't...

36:03.703 --> 36:05.580
- Okay?

36:05.622 --> 36:07.749
- Okay.

36:05.622 --> 36:07.749
- Are we good?

36:07.791 --> 36:09.042
We're good.

36:09.918 --> 36:11.920
- Yes, sir.

36:09.918 --> 36:11.920
- Better be.

36:13.338 --> 36:15.298
Swear to God, you're gonna be

36:13.338 --> 36:15.298
the death of me, kid.

36:15.340 --> 36:17.383
- I...

36:15.340 --> 36:17.383
- Straighten up!

36:17.425 --> 36:19.594
Sorry, Chief.

36:28.353 --> 36:30.355
Textbook, right?

36:30.396 --> 36:32.231
Yeah, he was really good...

36:32.273 --> 36:34.985
at keeping everyone

36:32.273 --> 36:34.985
off-balance.

36:35.027 --> 36:38.404
At knowing how far to go

36:35.027 --> 36:38.404
without going too far.

36:38.446 --> 36:40.490
At covering his tracks.

36:41.574 --> 36:43.952
At controlling

36:41.574 --> 36:43.952
the local gossip.

36:43.994 --> 36:47.413
This was a...

36:43.994 --> 36:47.413
master craftsman

36:47.455 --> 36:50.167
in the fine art

36:47.455 --> 36:50.167
of manipulation.

36:52.585 --> 36:53.879
Are you gonna be

36:52.585 --> 36:53.879
fine tonight?

36:53.920 --> 36:55.296
- Closin'?

36:53.920 --> 36:55.296
- Yeah.

36:55.338 --> 36:56.715
I could wait for you

36:55.338 --> 36:56.715
if you want.

36:56.756 --> 36:58.633
No. I'll be fine.

37:00.593 --> 37:03.221
Hey, are you okay?

37:03.262 --> 37:06.599
You know, a bunch of us

37:03.262 --> 37:06.599
are kinda concerned.

37:06.641 --> 37:08.060
You don't really

37:06.641 --> 37:08.060
seem yourself.

37:08.101 --> 37:09.352
I'm fine.

37:10.103 --> 37:11.855
I'll be fine.

37:13.690 --> 37:17.194
Hey, if you wanna talk

37:13.690 --> 37:17.194
or, you know...

37:17.944 --> 37:19.988
No, I am super tough.

37:20.739 --> 37:23.075
- Remember?

37:20.739 --> 37:23.075
- Okay.

37:23.533 --> 37:25.077
All right.

37:54.898 --> 37:57.901
You know, I think

37:54.898 --> 37:57.901
we're really good together.

37:57.943 --> 38:00.445
That's what

37:57.943 --> 38:00.445
I've been wanting to tell you.

38:05.491 --> 38:09.913
But you,

38:05.491 --> 38:09.913
you keep turnin' off on me.

38:09.955 --> 38:10.956
Why?

38:14.167 --> 38:17.045
I just wanna be with you, okay?

38:14.167 --> 38:17.045
Take care of you.

38:17.087 --> 38:19.505
It's driving me crazy.

38:17.087 --> 38:19.505
I mean, uh...

38:24.052 --> 38:25.845
Come on, Julie.

38:27.513 --> 38:29.849
What do you say, huh?

38:29.891 --> 38:32.811
It could be

38:29.891 --> 38:32.811
like this, always.

38:48.118 --> 38:51.204
Yeah, well, you tell him

38:48.118 --> 38:51.204
to stay away from her.

38:51.246 --> 38:55.083
But... Chief, I don't care,

38:51.246 --> 38:55.083
and that's my daughter.

38:56.375 --> 38:58.586
What... Okay.

39:00.463 --> 39:02.924
Yeah.

39:05.468 --> 39:06.886
What did he say?

39:08.680 --> 39:11.057
David was apparently...

39:11.099 --> 39:14.186
with someone tonight

39:11.099 --> 39:14.186
who backed up his story.

39:14.227 --> 39:17.022
He told the chief he wasn't

39:14.227 --> 39:17.022
anywhere near the diner.

39:18.064 --> 39:20.233
Who did he say he was with?

39:20.608 --> 39:22.360
Gail.

39:22.401 --> 39:24.237
From the police station?

39:24.279 --> 39:26.239
Yeah.

39:31.577 --> 39:34.497
I don't understand.

39:31.577 --> 39:34.497
What did I... do?

39:34.539 --> 39:38.793
Hey. You didn't do

39:34.539 --> 39:38.793
anything wrong.

39:39.961 --> 39:42.214
No one deserves

39:39.961 --> 39:42.214
to be treated that way.

39:42.255 --> 39:44.841
And we're not gonna let him get

39:42.255 --> 39:44.841
away with any more of this.

39:44.883 --> 39:48.386
I'm gonna kill the bastard

39:44.883 --> 39:48.386
before anything happens to you.

39:53.975 --> 39:55.852
Changing Woman.

39:59.438 --> 40:02.441
Changing Woman.

40:05.028 --> 40:06.571
Tell me again.

40:13.245 --> 40:15.914
Once upon a time...

40:17.540 --> 40:20.001
there was nothing

40:17.540 --> 40:20.001
but darkness...

41:27.735 --> 41:30.447
Okay, no, but I'm saying

41:27.735 --> 41:30.447
that I didn't do it.

41:30.488 --> 41:32.073
Somebody else did.

41:32.115 --> 41:35.701
Uh, somebody who...

41:32.115 --> 41:35.701
hacked my email or something.

41:35.743 --> 41:38.830
Okay, resubmit my application

41:35.743 --> 41:38.830
with proof of identification

41:38.871 --> 41:41.207
when you already have

41:38.871 --> 41:41.207
my application. I...

41:41.249 --> 41:42.541
Don't you have any sort of,

41:41.249 --> 41:42.541
like,

41:42.583 --> 41:44.336
fact-check system

41:42.583 --> 41:44.336

41:44.377 --> 41:48.465
Or are your heads

41:44.377 --> 41:48.465
too far up each other's asses?

41:49.799 --> 41:51.550
Hello?

42:26.294 --> 42:28.004
What can I get you guys?

42:31.549 --> 42:33.092
- Hi.

42:31.549 --> 42:33.092
- Where've you been? I've been...

42:33.134 --> 42:34.593
I've been working

42:33.134 --> 42:34.593
both sides of the counter.

42:34.635 --> 42:36.929
I'm sorry, um...

42:36.971 --> 42:39.391
You know, I'm just not

42:36.971 --> 42:39.391

42:39.432 --> 42:40.475

What you said about him

It really shows

44:13.901 --> 44:16.279
Look, I shouldn't

44:13.901 --> 44:16.279
even be saying this,

44:16.321 --> 44:20.074
but... do you know he's had

44:16.321 --> 44:20.074
thoughts of hurting himself?

44:20.116 --> 44:22.619
That's what you're doing

44:20.116 --> 44:22.619
to his reputation.

44:22.660 --> 44:24.954
I mean, thank God

44:22.660 --> 44:24.954
I've been there for him.

44:24.996 --> 44:26.747
Some nights I...

44:26.789 --> 44:29.208
Some nights I spend hours

44:26.789 --> 44:29.208
holding him

44:29.250 --> 44:30.835
and consoling him.

44:30.876 --> 44:33.212
Sweetheart,

44:30.876 --> 44:33.212
it's four dollars.

44:34.797 --> 44:36.466
Well...

44:36.508 --> 44:38.426
Keep the change.

44:38.468 --> 44:40.886
And keep your mouth shut.

44:50.647 --> 44:55.485
<i>♪ Just another prom night</i>

44:50.647 --> 44:55.485
<i>Car crash... ♪</i>

44:58.154 --> 45:00.198
The money in the jar was gone

44:58.154 --> 45:00.198
when I opened it.

45:00.239 --> 45:02.283
Nothing else was there,

45:00.239 --> 45:02.283
but, uh...

45:03.535 --> 45:05.870
- But what?

45:12.293 --> 45:14.045
Okay, this is good.

45:16.548 --> 45:18.508
Look, something's not right.

45:19.551 --> 45:21.052
I've been thinking

45:19.551 --> 45:21.052
about this,

45:21.093 --> 45:23.346
all the stuff that's

45:21.093 --> 45:23.346
been happenin' to you,

45:23.388 --> 45:24.930
it's not random.

45:26.182 --> 45:28.100
I think somebody's after you.

45:29.602 --> 45:31.688
I-I-I don't know.

45:31.728 --> 45:34.566
Maybe not, but I've been

45:31.728 --> 45:34.566
speaking to my dad about it.

45:36.317 --> 45:39.696
He gave me... some security.

45:41.906 --> 45:44.534
In my glove box,

45:41.906 --> 45:44.534
there's a handgun.

45:44.576 --> 45:46.202
No, I can't, I can't.

45:46.244 --> 45:48.037
I can't even

45:46.244 --> 45:48.037
think about that right now.

45:49.330 --> 45:53.000
Look, if you need anything,

45:53.042 --> 45:56.671
I can help you.

45:53.042 --> 45:56.671
It's gonna be okay.

45:56.713 --> 45:58.381
It's gonna be okay.

46:00.132 --> 46:03.219
Hey, hey. Hey, it's okay.

46:04.387 --> 46:07.848
- It's okay. Hey, it's okay.

46:08.558 --> 46:10.685
It's gonna be okay.

46:13.770 --> 46:16.649
Uh. Uh...

46:20.861 --> 46:23.281
- You're sweet.

46:20.861 --> 46:23.281
- I know.

46:26.200 --> 46:29.078
And don't worry

46:26.200 --> 46:29.078
about what Gail said.

46:29.120 --> 46:30.996
Okay, just another case

46:29.120 --> 46:30.996
of some guy's new girlfriend

46:31.038 --> 46:32.248
talking to the last one.

46:32.290 --> 46:33.916
Hmm.

46:33.958 --> 46:35.668
It's how this town works.

46:36.669 --> 46:37.878
Right.

46:39.589 --> 46:40.965
Yeah.

46:41.006 --> 46:42.383
I gotta get back inside.

46:42.425 --> 46:43.635
Cherise is coming to help me.

46:43.676 --> 46:46.887
So you get out of here,

46:43.676 --> 46:46.887
all right?

46:53.645 --> 46:56.188
Make sure you relax, okay?

47:20.045 --> 47:22.674
<i>- DMV, this is Suzanne.</i>

47:20.045 --> 47:22.674
- Hey, it's me.

47:22.715 --> 47:25.384
<i>Hi. Is everything okay?</i>

47:25.426 --> 47:27.052
I need to ask a favor.

47:27.094 --> 47:29.472
<i>Of course.</i>

47:27.094 --> 47:29.472
<i>Whatever you need.</i>

47:29.514 --> 47:32.057
<i>I need to find</i>

47:29.514 --> 47:32.057
<i>somebody in East Larson.</i>

47:56.791 --> 47:58.042
Can I help you?

47:58.083 --> 47:59.836
Are-are you Alicia Warren?

48:06.551 --> 48:08.135
I am.

48:08.177 --> 48:10.929
Um, this is gonna sound

48:08.177 --> 48:10.929
kind of weird,

48:10.971 --> 48:14.308
but did you used to date a guy

48:10.971 --> 48:14.308
named David Barragan?

48:16.561 --> 48:18.354
No.

48:16.561 --> 48:18.354
I'm sorry.

48:18.396 --> 48:20.939
- You have the wrong person.

48:18.396 --> 48:20.939
- No, but you did. I...

48:20.981 --> 48:23.234
Look, I know that you did.

48:23.275 --> 48:25.110
I don't have anything

48:23.275 --> 48:25.110
to say to you.

48:25.152 --> 48:27.697
But, excuse me, I just wanted

48:25.152 --> 48:27.697
to ask you a couple questions.

48:27.739 --> 48:30.199
- Did you bring him here?

48:27.739 --> 48:30.199
- No.

48:30.241 --> 48:32.326
- No, no, no. No.

48:30.241 --> 48:32.326
- You need to leave right now.

48:32.368 --> 48:33.703
Just leave, or I'm

48:32.368 --> 48:33.703
gonna call the police.

48:33.745 --> 48:35.538
No, no, no. Please, please.

48:33.745 --> 48:35.538
I just... I...

48:35.580 --> 48:37.456
Did he ever threaten you

48:37.498 --> 48:39.208
or make you feel...

48:40.543 --> 48:42.879
Because I think

48:40.543 --> 48:42.879
that he's doing it to me.

48:43.546 --> 48:44.963
- Look.

48:45.005 --> 48:46.507
- I'm sorry.

48:45.005 --> 48:46.507
- No, please.

48:46.549 --> 48:47.884
No, you're on your own.

48:46.549 --> 48:47.884
I'm really sorry.

48:47.924 --> 48:50.887
- You have to leave.

48:47.924 --> 48:50.887
- Please. Please.

48:50.927 --> 48:53.097
But I just... I re... I need...

48:53.138 --> 48:54.599
I just need your help!

48:54.640 --> 48:56.726
I can't help you.

48:58.644 --> 49:00.396
Damn it!

50:12.259 --> 50:14.553
Just get the hell away from me!

50:14.595 --> 50:16.555
- You know...

50:16.597 --> 50:18.140
I seem to remember telling you

50:18.182 --> 50:20.309
if you weren't careful,

50:18.182 --> 50:20.309
you'd end up in a ditch.

50:20.351 --> 50:22.561
You also said

50:20.351 --> 50:22.561
that I would kill somebody.

50:22.603 --> 50:25.105
Cute.

50:25.147 --> 50:27.942
I need to see your license

50:25.147 --> 50:27.942
and registration.

50:30.277 --> 50:32.655
Where do you think

50:30.277 --> 50:32.655
you're going?

50:34.907 --> 50:36.325
Huh?

50:38.076 --> 50:40.746
Please, David,

50:38.076 --> 50:40.746
what do you want?

50:51.173 --> 50:52.299
So, you're gonna kill me?

50:52.341 --> 50:54.010
That's up to you.

50:54.844 --> 50:56.387
What does that mean?

50:57.847 --> 51:00.140
You know, I wouldn't

50:57.847 --> 51:00.140
have to do any of this

51:00.182 --> 51:02.309
if you would just

51:00.182 --> 51:02.309
leave things alone.

51:03.561 --> 51:07.147
But instead,

51:03.561 --> 51:07.147
you go to see Alicia.

51:07.189 --> 51:09.817
And you didn't

51:07.189 --> 51:09.817
think I would know?

51:07.189 --> 51:09.817
I know everything.

51:11.569 --> 51:14.279
What are you two

51:11.569 --> 51:14.279
gonna do, huh?

51:14.321 --> 51:17.700
Gang up on me?

51:17.742 --> 51:21.579
- It's just two crazies talking.

51:22.914 --> 51:25.791
- You're psycho.

51:27.459 --> 51:29.336
Now that's a shame.

51:35.091 --> 51:37.093
What have you been

51:35.091 --> 51:37.093
drinking, Julie?

51:42.975 --> 51:46.311
I want you to come

51:42.975 --> 51:46.311
with me. Yeah.

51:47.897 --> 51:50.775
- No.

51:47.897 --> 51:50.775
- Hey! Shh, shh.

51:50.816 --> 51:52.234
Shh.

51:53.235 --> 51:55.279
I just want you to

51:53.235 --> 51:55.279
come with me.

51:55.320 --> 51:57.907
- I wanna show you something.

51:55.320 --> 51:57.907
- No.

51:57.949 --> 51:59.366
- I'm not going with you, David.

51:57.949 --> 51:59.366
- Shh.

51:59.408 --> 52:01.077
Everything is gonna be fine.

51:59.408 --> 52:01.077
Okay?

52:01.117 --> 52:02.995
- Help! Help! Help!

52:01.117 --> 52:02.995
- Hey!

52:03.037 --> 52:05.456
- Shh. Hey!

52:03.037 --> 52:05.456
- Help me! Somebody help me!

52:07.374 --> 52:09.961
- Out. Out.

52:12.337 --> 52:14.548
I took it back.

52:14.590 --> 52:17.175
You don't mind, do you?

52:19.971 --> 52:22.890
You never really

52:19.971 --> 52:22.890
appreciated it anyway.

52:27.812 --> 52:30.648
I was so, so good to you,

52:30.689 --> 52:32.984
and you just spit in my face.

52:43.995 --> 52:45.370
You're right.

52:47.289 --> 52:50.001
I wasn't good to you.

52:47.289 --> 52:50.001
I was terrible.

52:50.793 --> 52:53.963
Guess my...

52:54.005 --> 52:58.467
My feelings get ahead

52:54.005 --> 52:58.467
of me sometimes and...

52:59.969 --> 53:04.180
and...

52:59.969 --> 53:04.180
I just...

53:04.222 --> 53:06.642
I get scared of-of

53:04.222 --> 53:06.642
my feelings

53:06.684 --> 53:10.146
and I can't see

53:06.684 --> 53:10.146
what's in front of me

53:10.186 --> 53:13.649
or...

53:10.186 --> 53:13.649
Even appreciate it, so...

53:31.583 --> 53:33.335
Help me.

54:05.951 --> 54:07.243
Mm.

54:14.418 --> 54:16.921
This is where

54:14.418 --> 54:16.921
I wanted to bring you.

54:21.508 --> 54:24.053
Come on. Get out.

54:33.062 --> 54:35.522
Air up here

54:33.062 --> 54:35.522
is so fresh, right?

54:37.775 --> 54:39.151
You know, they say

54:39.193 --> 54:41.904
that all of that's

54:39.193 --> 54:41.904
sacred Indian territory.

54:45.365 --> 54:47.118
You feelin' the vibe?

54:48.953 --> 54:51.455
This is Serrano land.

54:51.496 --> 54:53.373
- I'm Navajo.

54:51.496 --> 54:53.373
- No.

54:53.999 --> 54:56.794
You are beautiful.

55:00.338 --> 55:02.091
You know, I was gonna

55:00.338 --> 55:02.091
bring you up here,

55:02.133 --> 55:04.218
ask you to marry me

55:02.133 --> 55:04.218
right here.

55:05.177 --> 55:07.012
I love this spot.

55:10.474 --> 55:12.350
What would you have said?

55:18.732 --> 55:20.316
- Yes.

55:18.732 --> 55:20.316
- Yeah?

55:20.358 --> 55:21.693
Of course.

55:21.735 --> 55:23.528
- Of course?

55:21.735 --> 55:23.528
- Yes.

55:42.131 --> 55:45.383
You know, my dad's cabin

55:42.131 --> 55:45.383
is just up the road.

55:47.094 --> 55:51.015
I always felt like

55:47.094 --> 55:51.015
this was a magical place.

55:51.056 --> 55:54.185
I would ride my bike

55:51.056 --> 55:54.185
up here when I was a little kid.

55:54.226 --> 55:58.022
God, it was like

55:54.226 --> 55:58.022
I was in a distant land.

55:58.063 --> 55:59.815
Mm, maybe there is

55:58.063 --> 55:59.815
something to be said

55:59.857 --> 56:02.567
about the whole

55:59.857 --> 56:02.567
one-with-nature thing.

56:04.611 --> 56:07.656
Never really got much

56:04.611 --> 56:07.656
into that, but...

56:07.698 --> 56:12.286
I gotta say, something about

56:07.698 --> 56:12.286
being the only one in the world.

56:17.208 --> 56:19.001
You blew it.

58:00.394 --> 58:01.812
<i>I got home that night,</i>

58:01.853 --> 58:06.191
<i>and sh-she was just...</i>

58:01.853 --> 58:06.191
<i>gone.</i>

58:06.233 --> 58:09.236
<i>And then</i>

58:06.233 --> 58:09.236
<i>they found her car.</i>

58:09.278 --> 58:11.155
<i>All smashed up.</i>

58:11.196 --> 58:14.950
Her body was missing,

58:11.196 --> 58:14.950
so I wondered...

58:14.992 --> 58:18.454
"W-was she still alive?

58:18.495 --> 58:20.956
Did somebody take her?"

58:20.998 --> 58:22.666
Did they talk to David?

58:23.708 --> 58:25.461
Oh, yeah, but then again,

58:25.502 --> 58:27.338
he had an alibi.

58:27.379 --> 58:28.797
Gail.

58:29.881 --> 58:32.550
No one

58:29.881 --> 58:32.550
really wanted to believe

58:32.592 --> 58:35.304
that he had anything

58:32.592 --> 58:35.304
to do with it.

58:35.346 --> 58:37.931
Can you describe

58:35.346 --> 58:37.931
what you were feeling?

58:41.477 --> 58:44.188
I could only hope

58:41.477 --> 58:44.188
and pray that...

58:45.522 --> 58:48.400
somehow,

58:45.522 --> 58:48.400
some way,

58:48.442 --> 58:51.862
she was... still alive.

59:06.126 --> 59:09.171
You never know

59:06.126 --> 59:09.171
where these cases will take you.

59:09.213 --> 59:12.590
This one took me

59:09.213 --> 59:12.590
to Coldwater Hills.

59:14.468 --> 59:18.472
You know what WMD stands for

59:14.468 --> 59:18.472
in Coldwater Hills?

59:18.514 --> 59:20.224
Weapons of Mass Destruction?

59:22.518 --> 59:24.978
White men on duty.

59:30.526 --> 59:32.277
All right, listen up.

59:33.945 --> 59:35.489
This is Sergeant Miller.

59:35.531 --> 59:37.866
He's with the County Sheriff's

59:35.531 --> 59:37.866
Investigation...

59:37.908 --> 59:39.617
Criminal Investigative

59:37.908 --> 59:39.617
Division.

59:39.659 --> 59:42.120
That's the one.

59:39.659 --> 59:42.120
He's here to help us

59:42.162 --> 59:43.497
with the Julie Dillon situation.

59:43.539 --> 59:45.123
I ask you to extend him

59:43.539 --> 59:45.123
every courtesy

59:45.165 --> 59:46.791
that you would me.

59:48.210 --> 59:49.420
Sergeant Miller.

59:49.461 --> 59:50.837
Thank you, Chief.

59:53.882 --> 59:55.426
First, we need to set up

59:53.882 --> 59:55.426
a timeline.

59:55.467 --> 59:56.510
Who saw her last?

59:56.552 --> 59:58.803
Has she made any phone calls?

59:58.845 --> 01:00:01.014
Her body missing from the scene

59:58.845 --> 01:00:01.014
of the accident suggests

01:00:01.056 --> 01:00:02.349
suspicious circumstances.

01:00:02.391 --> 01:00:04.059
Does she have any

01:00:02.391 --> 01:00:04.059
known enemies?

01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:05.519
Significant other? Ex?

01:00:05.561 --> 01:00:07.521
Anybody that would

01:00:05.561 --> 01:00:07.521
wanna wish her harm.

01:00:07.563 --> 01:00:08.939
Anybody she's had trouble with.

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:10.607
Anything.

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:19.324
What am I missing here?

01:00:23.287 --> 01:00:26.039
Okay. I've got nothing to hide.

01:00:26.081 --> 01:00:27.458
How many reports had to be made

01:00:27.499 --> 01:00:29.042
before you take this seriously?

01:00:29.084 --> 01:00:31.420
Well,

01:00:29.084 --> 01:00:31.420
first of all,

01:00:29.084 --> 01:00:31.420
this girl,

01:00:31.462 --> 01:00:33.505
she's known to exaggerate.

01:00:33.547 --> 01:00:34.881
Look at what we have.

01:00:34.923 --> 01:00:36.841
We have her car,

01:00:34.923 --> 01:00:36.841
busted up in a ditch

01:00:36.883 --> 01:00:39.177
covered in alcohol, and

01:00:36.883 --> 01:00:39.177
her gone from the scene.

01:00:39.219 --> 01:00:41.888
How does that implicate

01:00:39.219 --> 01:00:41.888
Officer Barragan?

01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:45.183
Look, all I know is that

01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:45.183
if he's part of this,

01:00:45.225 --> 01:00:47.269
he has anything to do

01:00:45.225 --> 01:00:47.269
with her disappearance,

01:00:47.311 --> 01:00:49.687
the accident, anything,

01:00:49.729 --> 01:00:51.731
that's gonna come back

01:00:49.729 --> 01:00:51.731
on you hard.

01:00:51.773 --> 01:00:53.233
If you're implying

01:00:51.773 --> 01:00:53.233
that I'm somehow

01:00:53.275 --> 01:00:54.359
to blame for any of this...

01:00:54.401 --> 01:00:56.987
I'm not implying anything.

01:00:57.028 --> 01:00:59.490
Just considering the facts.

01:00:59.531 --> 01:01:01.199
Yeah, well, consider this.

01:01:01.241 --> 01:01:04.119
This is my goddamn case,

01:01:01.241 --> 01:01:04.119
Sergeant Miller.

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:05.954
I'm willing to work

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:05.954
with you here, but I suggest

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:07.705
you mind your tone.

01:01:11.293 --> 01:01:12.586
You're right. Your town.

01:01:12.628 --> 01:01:13.837
- Those are the rules.

01:01:12.628 --> 01:01:13.837
- Thank you.

01:01:13.878 --> 01:01:14.963
Don't mind me if I keep

01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:16.756
an eye on that kid.

01:01:16.798 --> 01:01:19.343
Do whatever

01:01:16.798 --> 01:01:19.343
makes you feel helpful.

01:01:19.384 --> 01:01:21.219
I'm gonna send my guys

01:01:19.384 --> 01:01:21.219
out to Stanton Farm,

01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:23.054
we're gonna work

01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:23.054
our way out from there.

01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:24.973
Soon as we cross

01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:24.973
the town line,

01:01:25.015 --> 01:01:27.351
I'll be sure

01:01:25.015 --> 01:01:27.351
and let you know.

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.479
Thanks for stopping by.

01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:57.982
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:57.982
<i>in a distant land,</i>

01:02:58.024 --> 01:03:00.110
<i>there was nothing</i>

01:03:00.151 --> 01:03:03.154
<i>but darkness, until...</i>

01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:05.240
Changing Woman.

01:03:05.282 --> 01:03:09.703
Every year, Changing Woman

01:03:09.745 --> 01:03:11.788
was born in the spring,

01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:13.707
died in winter,

01:03:13.749 --> 01:03:17.919
and magically was

01:03:13.749 --> 01:03:17.919
reborn again in the spring.

01:03:17.961 --> 01:03:19.963
Changing Woman had...?

01:03:21.089 --> 01:03:22.507
Twins.

01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:24.968
That's right.

01:03:25.009 --> 01:03:27.512
Twin children...

01:03:27.554 --> 01:03:31.057
born with special powers.

01:03:31.099 --> 01:03:33.602
<i>When they were older,</i>

01:03:33.644 --> 01:03:37.105
<i>the twins set out</i>

01:03:33.644 --> 01:03:37.105
<i>to find their father,</i>

01:03:37.147 --> 01:03:40.275
<i>who was the shining sun</i>

01:03:37.147 --> 01:03:40.275
<i>above.</i>

01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:42.277
<i>On their dangerous</i>

01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:42.277
<i>journey,</i>

01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:44.404
<i>they met Spider Woman,</i>

01:03:44.446 --> 01:03:47.532
<i>who protected and guided them</i>

01:03:44.446 --> 01:03:47.532
<i>along the way.</i>

01:03:47.574 --> 01:03:50.160
When they reached

01:03:47.574 --> 01:03:50.160
their father,

01:03:50.201 --> 01:03:53.163
<i>he knew that</i>

01:03:50.201 --> 01:03:53.163
<i>they were his children,</i>

01:03:53.204 --> 01:03:55.081
<i>and he told them</i>

01:03:55.123 --> 01:03:57.542
all about the monsters.

01:03:57.584 --> 01:03:59.544
Bringers of chaos.

01:04:00.671 --> 01:04:04.382
So, when the monsters come...

01:04:04.424 --> 01:04:07.969
we can seek the power

01:04:04.424 --> 01:04:07.969
to destroy them

01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:10.972
<i>by saying to the sun,</i>

01:04:11.014 --> 01:04:13.891
<i>"Give me the light</i>

01:04:11.014 --> 01:04:13.891
<i>of your mind,</i>

01:04:13.933 --> 01:04:17.187
<i>that my mind</i>

01:04:13.933 --> 01:04:17.187
<i>may be strong.</i>

01:04:17.228 --> 01:04:20.440
Give me some of your strength,

01:04:20.482 --> 01:04:24.194
that my arm may be strong."

01:04:36.873 --> 01:04:38.583
Are you okay, baby?

01:04:40.669 --> 01:04:42.713
- Hm?

01:04:40.669 --> 01:04:42.713
- Yeah. Yeah, I...

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.800
Sorry, just, uh, just a dream.

01:04:47.718 --> 01:04:50.970
Just, um...

01:04:51.012 --> 01:04:53.306
I've got a lot on my mind

01:04:51.012 --> 01:04:53.306
with all this...

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.144
- Hope I didn't scare you.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.144
- No.

01:04:58.186 --> 01:04:59.937
No, I'm, I'm good.

01:04:59.979 --> 01:05:03.191
I'm... I'm really,

01:04:59.979 --> 01:05:03.191
really good, actually.

01:05:03.233 --> 01:05:05.819
Is that terrible?

01:05:07.195 --> 01:05:09.989
Just... I don't know,

01:05:07.195 --> 01:05:09.989
I just...

01:05:10.031 --> 01:05:11.867
I feel like you were

01:05:10.031 --> 01:05:11.867
brought here for a reason.

01:05:11.908 --> 01:05:14.494
You know?

01:05:11.908 --> 01:05:14.494
Like this was meant to be.

01:05:14.536 --> 01:05:18.081
N-not Julie going missing,

01:05:14.536 --> 01:05:18.081
of course, but...

01:05:18.122 --> 01:05:20.625
I don't know,

01:05:18.122 --> 01:05:20.625
me working at the station,

01:05:20.667 --> 01:05:23.336
and you knowing the chief.

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:27.758
He's always been there for me.

01:05:27.799 --> 01:05:29.593
So many people have deserted me,

01:05:29.634 --> 01:05:31.428
but through the hardest parts

01:05:29.634 --> 01:05:31.428
of my life,

01:05:31.469 --> 01:05:33.054
he has been there.

01:05:33.764 --> 01:05:35.139
Baby, I'm here.

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:36.892
Right?

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:38.101
I know. Yeah, um...

01:05:38.142 --> 01:05:40.061
No, I just...

01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:45.233
I just want to...

01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:45.233
make him proud, you know?

01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:47.151
Feel I owe that to him.

01:05:47.193 --> 01:05:49.571
I know, I know

01:05:47.193 --> 01:05:49.571
he's proud of you.

01:05:49.613 --> 01:05:52.073
I see it in his eyes.

01:05:52.115 --> 01:05:53.742
And I am, too.

01:05:54.492 --> 01:05:55.993
No matter what.

01:06:03.627 --> 01:06:05.837
What do you mean,

01:06:03.627 --> 01:06:05.837
"No matter what?"

01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:10.133
I mean, David, we...

01:06:10.174 --> 01:06:12.803
we both know you weren't

01:06:10.174 --> 01:06:12.803
with me Friday night.

01:06:16.013 --> 01:06:17.432
Where were you?

01:06:21.561 --> 01:06:23.313
Do you really want to know?

01:06:26.065 --> 01:06:28.151
I went to get

01:06:26.065 --> 01:06:28.151
something for you.

01:06:28.192 --> 01:06:31.655
Something that I think

01:06:28.192 --> 01:06:31.655
you will like.

01:06:31.696 --> 01:06:33.364
Um...

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:35.826
- But if you want me to--

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:35.826
- No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

01:06:35.867 --> 01:06:38.495
No, don't you dare tell me.

01:06:35.867 --> 01:06:38.495
You just...

01:06:38.536 --> 01:06:41.873
You just wait until

01:06:38.536 --> 01:06:41.873
you are good and ready.

01:06:43.792 --> 01:06:46.127
'Cause I am right here.

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:48.713
And I've got something

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:48.713
for you, too,

01:06:48.755 --> 01:06:50.548
if that's okay.

01:07:14.572 --> 01:07:17.367
- Sgt. Miller?

01:07:14.572 --> 01:07:17.367
- Mrs. Dillon, yes?

01:07:17.408 --> 01:07:19.202
She's still alive.

01:07:19.243 --> 01:07:22.079
- Excuse me?

01:07:19.243 --> 01:07:22.079
- My daughter is still alive.

01:07:23.247 --> 01:07:24.290
I heard her.

01:07:24.332 --> 01:07:26.710
I heard her voice.

01:07:26.751 --> 01:07:28.628
Mrs. Dillon, our minds

01:07:26.751 --> 01:07:28.628
can play all kinds

01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:30.171
of tricks on us

01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:30.171
when we're in distress.

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:31.840
- No.

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:31.840
- Yes. I've seen it before.

01:07:31.882 --> 01:07:34.300
No, it was no trick.

01:07:34.342 --> 01:07:37.428
I heard her as clear

01:07:34.342 --> 01:07:37.428
as I'm hearing you.

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:40.682
She's out there somewhere.

01:07:40.724 --> 01:07:44.227
She's alive,

01:07:40.724 --> 01:07:44.227
and she's waiting to be found.

01:07:45.645 --> 01:07:49.649
So, please, go find her.

01:08:17.761 --> 01:08:19.470
I wanted to be with you, Julie.

01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:21.264
I really did.

01:08:22.305 --> 01:08:23.975
But if I can't have you,

01:08:24.017 --> 01:08:25.685
nobody will!

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.191
Do you hear me?

01:08:35.236 --> 01:08:38.573
I don't know where you went,

01:08:35.236 --> 01:08:38.573
but I will find you.

01:08:54.546 --> 01:08:56.215
Sgt. Miller.

01:08:56.256 --> 01:08:57.591
What are you doing here?

01:08:57.634 --> 01:08:59.676
Well, I could ask you

01:08:57.634 --> 01:08:59.676
the same thing.

01:09:00.804 --> 01:09:03.139
Everybody's out near

01:09:00.804 --> 01:09:03.139
Stanton Farm.

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:06.850
Yeah, I just remembered

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:06.850
Julie loved coming out here.

01:09:06.893 --> 01:09:08.979
Came out here to think,

01:09:06.893 --> 01:09:08.979
get her head clear.

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:12.023
Thought maybe I could come

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:12.023
out here and find something.

01:09:12.064 --> 01:09:13.984
Seemed like a good idea.

01:09:14.024 --> 01:09:15.734
So, did you do it?

01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:18.904
Do what?

01:09:18.947 --> 01:09:21.365
Did you find anything?

01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:24.368
No. Nothing.

01:09:26.955 --> 01:09:30.082
Sure is pretty, though.

01:09:26.955 --> 01:09:30.082
Quiet, too.

01:09:31.626 --> 01:09:33.294
So far away from everything.

01:09:33.336 --> 01:09:34.671
Yeah. I got a cabin up here.

01:09:34.712 --> 01:09:36.171
Been coming for years.

01:09:36.212 --> 01:09:38.008
I know the area well.

01:09:38.049 --> 01:09:40.718
I'll head back, grab the dogs,

01:09:38.049 --> 01:09:40.718
get them back out here.

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:43.138
No, don't bother.

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:43.138
This is not local jurisdiction.

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:44.889
Oh, it's not a bother.

01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:47.183
Anything for Julie.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.854
No, seriously,

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.854
I got this area covered.

01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:55.316
You should head back to town.

01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:55.316
All hands on deck.

01:10:03.324 --> 01:10:04.993
All hands on deck.

01:10:26.764 --> 01:10:30.393
<i>At about that time,</i>

01:10:26.764 --> 01:10:30.393
<i>the two boys came forward.</i>

01:10:30.434 --> 01:10:32.729
<i>They'd, they'd</i>

01:10:30.434 --> 01:10:32.729
<i>seen Julie in a,</i>

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:34.814
<i>well, in-in a truck</i>

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:34.814
<i>that we thought</i>

01:10:34.856 --> 01:10:38.902
<i>could've been David's truck</i>

01:10:34.856 --> 01:10:38.902
<i>heading out to where</i>

01:10:38.943 --> 01:10:42.155
<i>Sgt. Miller found David</i>

01:10:38.943 --> 01:10:42.155
<i>poking around.</i>

01:10:42.197 --> 01:10:44.281
But you weren't

01:10:42.197 --> 01:10:44.281
so sure at the time?

01:10:47.952 --> 01:10:51.414
Look, being police means

01:10:47.952 --> 01:10:51.414
you have to take

01:10:51.455 --> 01:10:53.374
every lead seriously.

01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:58.004
And, uh, it's also my job

01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:58.004
as chief to be skeptical

01:10:58.046 --> 01:11:01.382
<i>of pretty much everyone</i>

01:10:58.046 --> 01:11:01.382
<i>I come into contact with.</i>

01:11:02.967 --> 01:11:04.427
<i>But, uh...</i>

01:11:06.804 --> 01:11:08.264
<i>sometimes...</i>

01:11:10.433 --> 01:11:14.145
sometimes you just don't see

01:11:10.433 --> 01:11:14.145
things as clearly...

01:11:15.230 --> 01:11:16.606
as you'd like.

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.904
David, it's me.

01:11:24.405 --> 01:11:25.823
David?

01:11:37.168 --> 01:11:39.003
<i>So, did they talk to you?</i>

01:11:39.045 --> 01:11:40.755
Yeah, they talked to me.

01:11:40.797 --> 01:11:42.799
I think I was the last one

01:11:40.797 --> 01:11:42.799
to talk to Julie,

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:45.218
so they had

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:45.218
a lot of questions for me.

01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:47.303
Who did you talk to?

01:11:47.344 --> 01:11:49.680
Chief Dodd. Who else?

01:11:49.722 --> 01:11:53.143
I told him what I knew,

01:11:49.722 --> 01:11:53.143
and he did nothing with it.

01:11:53.184 --> 01:11:55.145
Thank God Miller was around.

01:11:55.186 --> 01:11:57.688
At least someone with some sense

01:11:55.186 --> 01:11:57.688
that people could talk to.

01:11:57.730 --> 01:11:59.774
And when I, when I

01:11:57.730 --> 01:11:59.774
talked to him, I told him.

01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:01.525
Told him what?

01:12:01.567 --> 01:12:03.611
That Julie had called me

01:12:01.567 --> 01:12:03.611
about Alicia.

01:12:10.451 --> 01:12:12.411
David is missing.

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:17.959
Are you saying

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:17.959
this girl Julie,

01:12:18.001 --> 01:12:19.585
she might actually be alive?

01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:22.755
I don't know, but...

01:12:22.797 --> 01:12:26.592
if she is alive, she probably

01:12:22.797 --> 01:12:26.592
needs our help, so...

01:12:26.634 --> 01:12:29.262
finding him is our best shot

01:12:26.634 --> 01:12:29.262
at finding her.

01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:32.556
You're gonna

01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:32.556
catch him, though.

01:12:33.599 --> 01:12:35.310
That's the plan.

01:12:38.437 --> 01:12:39.814
I mean, something like this...

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:41.983
If you, if you catch him...

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:46.904
If he gets locked up,

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:46.904
does he stay locked up?

01:12:46.946 --> 01:12:49.406
I mean...

01:12:49.448 --> 01:12:50.741
I don't know, man.

01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:51.951
Alicia...

01:12:53.995 --> 01:12:56.831
are you worried that

01:12:56.873 --> 01:12:59.416
if you help me here,

01:12:56.873 --> 01:12:59.416
he's gonna come for you?

01:13:00.293 --> 01:13:02.795
Look, if you can help us,

01:13:02.837 --> 01:13:05.131
we'll do everything we can

01:13:02.837 --> 01:13:05.131
to keep you safe.

01:13:05.173 --> 01:13:07.091
But we're up against it

01:13:05.173 --> 01:13:07.091
here, Alicia.

01:13:07.133 --> 01:13:09.385
If you know anything about

01:13:07.133 --> 01:13:09.385
where he might be hiding,

01:13:09.426 --> 01:13:11.012
where he might have gone...

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:15.892
I'm trying to think.

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:15.892
I just--

01:13:15.933 --> 01:13:19.562
Alicia, he very well

01:13:15.933 --> 01:13:19.562
may have killed this girl.

01:13:21.064 --> 01:13:22.690
Help us find him.

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:25.068
Help us find her.

01:13:32.575 --> 01:13:33.951
I'll be right back.

01:13:58.101 --> 01:13:59.352
What is this?

01:14:00.895 --> 01:14:03.106
He took me there

01:14:00.895 --> 01:14:03.106
a couple of times.

01:14:03.147 --> 01:14:05.108
It's outside of town.

01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:07.693
He said he had a cabin

01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:07.693
out near Kettle Woods.

01:14:07.735 --> 01:14:09.070
Is this it?

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:14.075
- Alicia... please.

01:14:14.117 --> 01:14:16.619
You have to promise me

01:14:14.117 --> 01:14:16.619
that I'm gonna be safe.

01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:19.580
- I-I'll do everything in my--

01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:19.580
- No, you have to promise me.

01:14:23.209 --> 01:14:24.377
I promise.

01:14:29.799 --> 01:14:31.384
Do you have a map?

01:14:31.426 --> 01:14:34.553
Look, I had nothing

01:14:31.426 --> 01:14:34.553
to do with it.

01:14:34.595 --> 01:14:36.472
<i>Well, neither did I.</i>

01:14:36.513 --> 01:14:39.225
Well, someone, whoever

01:14:36.513 --> 01:14:39.225
is trying to...

01:14:39.267 --> 01:14:41.852
frame me or take Julie,

01:14:39.267 --> 01:14:41.852
they're...

01:14:41.894 --> 01:14:43.187
They're trying to make me

01:14:41.894 --> 01:14:43.187
look like

01:14:43.229 --> 01:14:45.606
a crazy person,

01:14:43.229 --> 01:14:45.606
like a killer.

01:14:45.648 --> 01:14:49.110
<i>David, do you think</i>

01:14:45.648 --> 01:14:49.110
<i>I'm stupid?</i>

01:14:49.152 --> 01:14:51.404
I think you're amazing.

01:14:53.281 --> 01:14:56.659
But I do need your help

01:14:53.281 --> 01:14:56.659
with something.

01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:59.329
- I, uh...

01:15:08.504 --> 01:15:10.547
I'm gonna have to

01:15:08.504 --> 01:15:10.547
call you back.

01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:14.218
Sergeant...

01:15:15.719 --> 01:15:17.180
What's going on?

01:15:18.055 --> 01:15:20.057
What did these boys say?

01:15:21.142 --> 01:15:22.768
I heard David's missing.

01:15:22.810 --> 01:15:25.313
We don't have

01:15:22.810 --> 01:15:25.313
all the information yet.

01:15:25.355 --> 01:15:27.190
David just hadn't shown up

01:15:25.355 --> 01:15:27.190
the last day or so,

01:15:27.231 --> 01:15:28.565
but I may have a lead.

01:15:29.775 --> 01:15:31.861
- About Julie?

01:15:29.775 --> 01:15:31.861
- Well, no.

01:15:31.902 --> 01:15:33.570
But I may have found David.

01:16:14.111 --> 01:16:16.155
Who's there?

01:17:04.995 --> 01:17:07.081
Just show yourself.

01:17:07.123 --> 01:17:09.542
I promise to make it quick.

01:17:20.386 --> 01:17:23.264
David, get out here now.

01:17:20.386 --> 01:17:23.264
We gotta talk.

01:17:23.306 --> 01:17:25.558
- Shit.

01:17:23.306 --> 01:17:25.558
- David!

01:17:27.893 --> 01:17:29.770
- Shit.

01:17:27.893 --> 01:17:29.770
- Son.

01:17:29.812 --> 01:17:31.939
Please, just...

01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:34.609
come out here and talk to me,

01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:34.609
will you?

01:17:41.365 --> 01:17:42.992
I'm here.

01:17:43.951 --> 01:17:45.995
What the hell happened?

01:17:47.037 --> 01:17:48.664
If you're innocent

01:17:47.037 --> 01:17:48.664
here, David,

01:17:48.705 --> 01:17:50.791
this, this doesn't help.

01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:53.085
I didn't do anything.

01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:53.085
You have to know that.

01:17:53.127 --> 01:17:56.422
You're like family to me, kid.

01:17:53.127 --> 01:17:56.422
You know that.

01:17:56.464 --> 01:17:59.175
- You're like my own boy.

01:17:56.464 --> 01:17:59.175
- I know.

01:17:59.216 --> 01:18:01.594
That's why you're the only one

01:17:59.216 --> 01:18:01.594
who can help me here.

01:18:01.636 --> 01:18:04.472
Somebody is making it look like

01:18:01.636 --> 01:18:04.472
I'm doing all these things.

01:18:04.514 --> 01:18:07.600
I got a message

01:18:04.514 --> 01:18:07.600
from Sgt. Miller.

01:18:07.642 --> 01:18:10.520
He spoke to Suzanne,

01:18:07.642 --> 01:18:10.520
and Alicia.

01:18:10.561 --> 01:18:12.021
Yeah, well, they're all liars.

01:18:13.147 --> 01:18:14.565
It's a witch hunt.

01:18:17.193 --> 01:18:19.945
We don't even know

01:18:17.193 --> 01:18:19.945
what to say, David.

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:23.282
They'll find you.

01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:28.287
That's, that's why I wanted

01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:28.287
to get to you first.

01:18:28.329 --> 01:18:33.626
Try to... talk

01:18:28.329 --> 01:18:33.626
some sense into you.

01:18:33.668 --> 01:18:35.586
Chief...

01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:38.714
Look.

01:18:38.755 --> 01:18:40.550
My father, he always

01:18:38.755 --> 01:18:40.550
trusted you--

01:18:40.591 --> 01:18:43.636
Oh, cut the crap, David!

01:18:46.805 --> 01:18:48.558
Come on, let's...

01:18:51.644 --> 01:18:55.022
Just, just, just come

01:18:51.644 --> 01:18:55.022
with me, all right?

01:18:57.441 --> 01:18:59.485
We'll sort it all out.

01:18:59.527 --> 01:19:01.404
Now, come on. All right?

01:20:26.238 --> 01:20:27.864
Shh...

01:20:29.158 --> 01:20:30.867
Shh...

01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:43.046
You're a monster.

01:20:44.965 --> 01:20:47.176
And I would do it all again.

01:20:50.304 --> 01:20:52.348
Because I love you, Julie.

01:21:08.155 --> 01:21:10.407
Why would that be loaded?

01:21:16.664 --> 01:21:20.083
As long as I live,

01:21:16.664 --> 01:21:20.083
I'll never stop.

01:21:21.544 --> 01:21:23.462
Aah!

01:21:47.069 --> 01:21:48.945
<i>When you work</i>

01:21:47.069 --> 01:21:48.945
<i>enough years on a job,</i>

01:21:48.987 --> 01:21:51.198
<i>you see all kinds</i>

01:21:48.987 --> 01:21:51.198
<i>of things.</i>

01:21:54.577 --> 01:21:56.453
Terrible things.

01:22:04.712 --> 01:22:07.005
<i>Beautiful things.</i>

01:22:17.974 --> 01:22:22.020
<i>And you just file it all away</i>

01:22:17.974 --> 01:22:22.020
<i>as much as you can and move on.</i>

01:22:35.826 --> 01:22:38.120
<i>But what I saw</i>

01:22:35.826 --> 01:22:38.120
<i>that morning...</i>

01:22:42.124 --> 01:22:44.960
that's gonna stick with me

01:22:42.124 --> 01:22:44.960
for the rest of my life.

01:22:48.964 --> 01:22:50.382
Julie!

01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:58.390
<i>There she was.</i>

01:22:58.432 --> 01:22:59.975
<i>Alive.</i>

01:23:00.851 --> 01:23:02.478
<i>My little girl.</i>

01:23:07.775 --> 01:23:09.944
Our children are bound to us.

01:23:10.736 --> 01:23:12.154
We're tied.

01:23:19.161 --> 01:23:23.290
Uh... Maybe someone

01:23:19.161 --> 01:23:23.290
<i>was</i> watching over her.

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:25.918
Giving her strength.

01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:29.129
Reminding her of what

01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:29.129
she had to live for.

01:23:29.797 --> 01:23:31.924
I mean...

01:23:31.966 --> 01:23:34.009
we all knew Julie was special.

01:23:35.552 --> 01:23:37.387
Here's what I know.

01:23:37.429 --> 01:23:39.389
I know a young woman

01:23:37.429 --> 01:23:39.389
was shot and left out

01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:41.892
in the middle

01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:41.892
of nowhere for three days.

01:23:41.934 --> 01:23:43.602
And somehow...

01:23:46.313 --> 01:23:49.733
somehow she... got up.

01:23:55.572 --> 01:23:57.825
There is no logical reason

01:23:55.572 --> 01:23:57.825
why my girl Julie Dillon

01:23:57.867 --> 01:23:59.117
is alive today.

01:23:59.159 --> 01:24:00.369
None.

01:24:03.163 --> 01:24:05.374
And yet, she is.

01:24:11.463 --> 01:24:13.465
And yet, I am.
