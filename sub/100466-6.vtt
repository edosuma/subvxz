you were either fighting
on a hill,

50:57.930 --> 50:58.847
or there was dialogue
on a hill,

50:59.098 --> 51:00.558
or you were sat
crouching in cover,

51:00.641 --> 51:01.767
but you were on a hill.

51:02.101 --> 51:04.937
(GRUNTING)

51:05.104 --> 51:06.730
It was absolutely brutal.

51:07.273 --> 51:08.691
JACK LOTHIAN: What we were
interested in doing

51:08.774 --> 51:11.402
was looking at,
when did Mac become Mac?

51:11.485 --> 51:13.404
‐(GUNFIRE)
‐Move, move!

51:15.489 --> 51:17.157
It was quite interesting
to go back and see

51:17.241 --> 51:19.660
what was the first
section 20‐type mission

51:19.743 --> 51:20.911
that Mac was ever on?

51:20.995 --> 51:22.413
His first, sort of decision

51:22.496 --> 51:23.998
to stand up to authority
or not.

51:24.081 --> 51:26.417
You split from your team,

51:26.500 --> 51:28.294
and then engaged the enemy.

51:28.627 --> 51:29.670
Sir.

51:29.753 --> 51:30.963
(MAN GRUNTS)

51:31.630 --> 51:32.548
And what laid the seeds

51:32.631 --> 51:34.425
for the person
that he ended up being.

51:34.508 --> 51:36.427
(MAN GROANING)

51:37.386 --> 51:38.929
Everything's falling apart.

51:39.972 --> 51:40.973
You don't want to let go.

51:41.348 --> 51:42.933
JAMIE BAMBER: My favorite
episode that I've read so far

51:43.017 --> 51:44.226
of Strike Back is episode six.

51:44.310 --> 51:46.061
And it's an episode
I'm not really in, at all.

51:46.145 --> 51:48.897
It just goes to show
we're not all selfish... actors.

51:49.273 --> 51:51.442
What was it like,
lying there, bleeding out?

51:51.525 --> 51:53.527
WARREN: When, you know,
the therapist is going,

51:53.611 --> 51:55.404
"Think about this incident
and what can you see?"

51:55.487 --> 51:58.198
And it was so fresh in my mind,
Wyatt and Alin

51:58.282 --> 52:01.118
and fuckin'... tears
coming down on my face,

52:01.201 --> 52:02.411
and that fuckin' hurt me.

52:02.494 --> 52:04.496
Then I just went to bits
in that scene.

52:05.581 --> 52:06.957
I was thinking...

52:07.499 --> 52:09.001
"Just hold on...

52:10.002 --> 52:11.045
just...

52:11.629 --> 52:12.838
one more breath.

52:15.466 --> 52:16.842
One more second."

52:17.843 --> 52:21.221
That scene on the day,
didn't feel like

52:21.305 --> 52:22.890
there was a lot of acting
involved. (CHUCKLES)

52:22.973 --> 52:25.434
Seeing him lie there
in that pool of blood,

52:25.517 --> 52:26.518
I couldn't look at it.

52:26.935 --> 52:31.273
It felt like I was constantly
on the verge of falling apart,

52:31.357 --> 52:32.566
and I think everyone felt
that way.

52:32.650 --> 52:34.860
‐MAN: Here he is!
‐DANIEL: I deliberately....

52:34.943 --> 52:37.071
slept about three hours
the night before.

52:37.154 --> 52:39.073
'Cause I knew that
I'd be just raw,

52:39.156 --> 52:40.908
and I said to Warren,
"I don't wanna see you that day.

52:40.991 --> 52:43.243
First time I see you is
on the ground, bleeding out."

52:43.327 --> 52:44.745
By that time, you're exhausted,
you're sweaty,

52:44.828 --> 52:45.954
I haven't slept for days,

52:46.038 --> 52:47.831
and, uh‐‐ And you go in,
and you see your‐‐

52:48.082 --> 52:50.459
your best mate
trying to stay alive for you.

52:50.542 --> 52:52.628
Don't you fuckin' leave me!
Don't you leave me!

52:52.711 --> 52:54.380
I hope it's
a pretty powerful moment.

52:56.799 --> 52:58.634
WARREN: So, originally‐‐ we have
afforded now with‐‐

52:58.717 --> 52:59.677
certainly with our gang,

52:59.760 --> 53:00.969
the two actually go
and do something

53:01.053 --> 53:02.721
that is very... not Strike Back.

53:02.805 --> 53:04.765
But still, quintessentially
Strike Back.

53:04.848 --> 53:07.309
I gave it everything,
and so did everyone,

53:07.393 --> 53:08.602
and I think it's just been
one fuckin'

53:08.686 --> 53:10.813
hell of an experience
that I will cherish,

53:10.896 --> 53:12.272
and never forget.
