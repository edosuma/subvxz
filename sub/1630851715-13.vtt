WEBVTT

00:02.872 --> 00:03.829
MARQUIS IS SICK.

00:03.873 --> 00:05.831
THERE WAS AN INCIDENT.

00:05.875 --> 00:07.964
THE JOKER PRESSED
THIS GODFORSAKEN THING

00:08.008 --> 00:10.053
TO MY SON'S HEAD
AND TURNED HIM
INTO A MONSTER.

00:10.097 --> 00:12.316
I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT
ANOTHER BUZZ
COULD CURE HIM.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.753
I AM LOSING MY MIND!

00:14.797 --> 00:16.277
THE HALLUCINATIONS
ARE BACK.

00:16.320 --> 00:17.800
I JUST NEED
A LITTLE EDGER

00:17.843 --> 00:19.236
UNTIL YOU CAN GET
ME THE JOY BUZZER.

00:19.280 --> 00:20.542
THERE'S ONLY ONE BUZZ LEFT.

00:20.585 --> 00:24.459
RYAN NEEDS IT...
FOR HER BROTHER.

00:24.502 --> 00:26.200
YOUR DAD
PROGRAMMED YOUR
SUIT'S AI

00:26.243 --> 00:27.984
TO SPEAK
WITH HIS VOICE?

00:28.028 --> 00:29.725
DAD, SAY HELLO
TO MARY.

00:29.768 --> 00:31.205
HELLO, MARY.

00:31.248 --> 00:33.207
IT'S LIKE YOU CAN
TALK TO HIM AGAIN.

00:33.250 --> 00:36.819
IT SEEMS BATWOMAN IS
A NO-SHOW.

00:38.560 --> 00:41.041
MY GOD.
THAT'S WHY BATWOMAN
DIDN'T SHOW UP.

00:41.084 --> 00:43.086
SHE WAS HERE
THE WHOLE TIME.

00:43.130 --> 00:45.349
I'M SORRY, MARY.

00:45.393 --> 00:47.003
WHAT DID YOU DO?

00:47.047 --> 00:49.005
WHAT IF I WERE
TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING

00:49.049 --> 00:51.399
THAT WOULD MAKE
THE JOKER...

00:51.442 --> 00:53.227
WISH HE WERE YOU?

00:53.270 --> 00:54.706
LET'S HAVE SOME FUN.

01:37.575 --> 01:41.144
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA! HA HA HA!

01:42.972 --> 01:44.626
HA HA HA HA!

02:25.275 --> 02:26.798
HA HA HA! HA HA HA!

02:28.365 --> 02:29.932
HA HA HA!

02:38.288 --> 02:41.117
HA HA HA HA!

02:41.161 --> 02:43.728
EXACTLY WHERE YOU SAID
THEY WOULD BE, FUNNY MAN.

03:17.284 --> 03:19.068
OH, MY GOD!

03:19.111 --> 03:20.504
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:20.548 --> 03:22.593
WHY ISN'T THIS STRONGER?

03:22.637 --> 03:24.334
ALICE, STOP THIS.

03:24.378 --> 03:26.249
VOLTAGE, CONDUCTOR.
THEY SAID IT WOULD WORK.

03:26.293 --> 03:28.599
- WHY ISN'T IT WORKING?
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:28.643 --> 03:30.949
GETTING ALICE
OUT OF MY HEAD!

03:30.993 --> 03:34.126
ALICE, STOP...THIS.

03:34.170 --> 03:35.519
- THAT COULD KILL YOU.
- GIVE IT BACK!

03:35.563 --> 03:36.912
WAIT, WAIT.

03:36.955 --> 03:38.827
JUST WAIT.

03:41.308 --> 03:44.789
I TOLD YOU I WOULD
HELP YOU!

03:44.833 --> 03:46.443
AND I FOUND A PLACE.

03:46.487 --> 03:48.532
IT'S IN SWITZERLAND,
IT'S NEAR GENEVA,

03:48.576 --> 03:51.405
AND IT'S CALLED
THE WEISSE KANINCHEN
SANATORIUM.

03:51.448 --> 03:53.972
THEY SPECIALIZE
IN CHILDHOOD TRAUMA.

03:55.713 --> 03:57.367
THEY CAN HELP YOU.

04:02.285 --> 04:04.026
NO.

04:06.028 --> 04:07.595
NO MORE CELLS.

04:10.032 --> 04:13.035
NO MORE INSTITUTIONS.

04:15.429 --> 04:17.300
I CANNOT BE
IN MY HEAD ANYMORE!

04:17.344 --> 04:19.346
I WANT OUT!

04:19.389 --> 04:23.393
PLEASE GET ME OUT.

04:23.437 --> 04:27.310
PLEASE, PLEASE.

04:29.617 --> 04:32.750
I CAN'T.

04:32.794 --> 04:34.622
PLEASE!

04:37.189 --> 04:39.017
ALL RIGHT, BATWOMAN.
WHAT'S THE PLAN?

04:39.061 --> 04:40.671
HOW DO WE BEST HANDLE
OUR ONE WILD

04:40.715 --> 04:42.238
AND PRECIOUS BUZZ?

04:42.282 --> 04:44.022
MARQUIS SHOWED US
HE DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS

04:44.066 --> 04:45.763
TO A SLIVER OF HUMANITY,

04:45.807 --> 04:47.504
AND THANKS TO, ALICE,
HE JUST GOT CONTROL

04:47.548 --> 04:49.245
OF THE BATCAVE,

04:49.289 --> 04:51.726
SO HOWEVER WE GET HIM,
IT'S GOT TO BE TODAY,

04:51.769 --> 04:55.207
AND IF THIS THING ONLY
HAS JUICE FOR ONE BUZZ,

04:55.251 --> 04:57.732
I HAVE TO BE THE ONE
TO MAKE THE PLAY.

04:57.775 --> 04:59.473
SO WE LURE HIM CLOSE,

04:59.516 --> 05:01.866
AND I HIT HIM BEFORE HE
KNOWS WHAT'S COMING.

05:01.910 --> 05:04.304
OR ALTERNATIVELY,
WE GIVE IT TO ALICE.

05:06.001 --> 05:07.959
SORRY I'M LATE.

05:08.003 --> 05:09.309
YOU KNOW SHE JUST GAVE
MARQUIS THE KEYS

05:09.352 --> 05:11.311
TO THE BATKINGDOM,
RIGHT?

05:11.354 --> 05:12.660
I JUST CAME BACK
FROM ARKHAM,

05:12.703 --> 05:14.357
WHERE I FOUND HER
PLAYING DIY

05:14.401 --> 05:17.012
ELECTROSHOCK THERAPY
WITH A SOCKET WRENCH.

05:17.055 --> 05:20.581
SHE'S NOT GONNA
SURVIVE HER NEXT
PSYCHOLOGICAL BREAK.

05:20.624 --> 05:22.583
WE TRIED TO HELP HER.

05:22.626 --> 05:24.149
ALICE MADE HER BED.

05:24.193 --> 05:26.978
OK, MARY.

05:27.022 --> 05:29.807
WE KNOW YOU FEEL
A CERTAIN...WHATEVER

05:29.851 --> 05:33.811
FOR HER,
BUT THE BUZZER CREATED MARQUIS.

05:33.855 --> 05:35.552
THE JOKER CREATED
MARQUIS,

05:35.596 --> 05:37.032
AND IF WE'RE
SPLITTING HAIRS,

05:37.075 --> 05:38.555
HE CREATED ALICE,
TOO.

05:38.599 --> 05:41.341
ALICE KILLED
YOUR MOM, MARY.

05:41.384 --> 05:43.908
DO YOU THINK
I FORGOT?

05:43.952 --> 05:46.607
YOU THINK I DON'T
KNOW HOW BADLY

05:46.650 --> 05:48.913
RYAN WANTS
HER BROTHER BACK

05:48.957 --> 05:51.351
OR THAT THE FIRST
TIME ALICE EVER
MET SOPHIE

05:51.394 --> 05:53.353
SHE THREW HER OFF
A 30-STORY BUILDING?

05:53.396 --> 05:56.530
I KNOW. IT IS NOT
LIKE THIS IS

05:56.573 --> 06:02.057
SOME EASY DECISION
FOR ME...OR ANYONE,

06:02.100 --> 06:06.757
BUT I BELIEVE ALICE
IS CAPABLE OF CHANGE.

06:06.801 --> 06:08.629
SHE JUST NEEDS
A CHANCE.

06:14.809 --> 06:17.812
COME ON. EACH ONE
OF YOU LOOKED ME
IN THE EYE

06:17.855 --> 06:20.118
A FEW WEEKS AGO,
APOLOGIZED

06:20.162 --> 06:22.425
FOR SIDELINING ME,
AND ASSURED ME

06:22.469 --> 06:24.471
I WOULD HAVE A VOICE
ON THIS TEAM.

06:25.994 --> 06:28.866
THIS IS IT.

06:28.910 --> 06:31.521
THIS IS ME USING
MY VOICE.

06:33.175 --> 06:36.787
THIS IS--THIS IS
WHAT I WANT.

06:36.831 --> 06:40.487
I NEED TO SAVE
ALICE'S LIFE.

06:47.015 --> 06:49.321
I JUST GOT
A LIVE URGENT MESSAGE
FROM MARQUIS JET.

06:49.365 --> 06:50.497
YEAH, ME, TOO.

06:50.540 --> 06:53.369
I THINK
WE ALL DID.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.154
WHAT'S UP, GOTHAM CITY?
WE HAVING FUN YET?

06:56.198 --> 06:57.765
MARQUIS JET HOLLERIN' AT YOU

06:57.808 --> 06:59.636
FROM A TOP-SECRET LOCATION.

06:59.680 --> 07:02.073
THE TIME HAS COME,
THE DAY IS HERE.

07:02.117 --> 07:04.249
TONIGHT IS THE DAMN NIGHT.

07:04.293 --> 07:06.469
I NEED EVERYONE
TO TAKE TO THE STREETS,

07:06.513 --> 07:08.602
GET OUT ON YOUR BALCONIES,
JUMP UP ON YOUR CAR.

07:08.645 --> 07:10.125
HELL, CLIMB UP
TO THE TIPPY TOP

07:10.168 --> 07:11.692
OF YOUR CORNER CHURCH STEEPLE

07:11.735 --> 07:13.868
BECAUSE IN 5 HOURS
ON THE DOT...

07:15.522 --> 07:18.176
I'M GONNA BE SHOUTING
BATWOMAN'S TRUE IDENTITY

07:18.220 --> 07:19.874
FROM THE ROOFTOPS.

07:21.702 --> 07:23.573
SPOILER ALERT!

07:23.617 --> 07:25.880
SHE'S NOT THE HERO
YOU THINK SHE IS.

07:25.923 --> 07:28.012
TICKTOCK, GOTHAM.

07:30.493 --> 07:32.843
THIS IS REALLY HAPPENING.

07:32.887 --> 07:36.456
MARQUIS JET IS ABOUT TO
SHUT BATWOMAN DOWN FOR GOOD.

07:43.941 --> 07:45.682
WE ARE STILL
HOURS AWAY

07:45.726 --> 07:47.510
FROM THE BATWOMAN NAME DROP,

07:47.554 --> 07:49.164
BUT CURIOSITY
HAS ALREADY PULLED

07:49.207 --> 07:51.079
SOME GOTHAM RESIDENTS
TO THE STREETS,

07:51.122 --> 07:54.909
REACTING TO CLAIMS MADE
BY WAYNE CEO MARQUIS JET

07:54.952 --> 07:56.650
THAT HE KNOWS
THE SCARLET KNIGHT'S

07:56.693 --> 07:58.913
SECRET IDENTITY
AND THAT WE SHOULD ALL BRACE

07:58.956 --> 08:00.567
FOR DISAPPOINTMENT.

08:00.610 --> 08:02.656
NO DETAILS BEYOND THAT
WERE TEASED,

08:02.699 --> 08:05.093
BUT PUTTING A FACE TO THE NAME
WOULD CERTAINLY BE

08:05.136 --> 08:08.488
THE END OF BUSINESS AS USUAL
FOR THE CAPED CRUSADER,

08:08.531 --> 08:11.534
WHOSE ANONYMITY IS KEY
TO HER OWN SAFETY

08:11.578 --> 08:13.231
AND THOSE OF HER LOVED ONES.

08:13.275 --> 08:14.972
WHILE VARIOUS THEORIES
SURROUNDING

08:15.016 --> 08:17.540
WHO'S BEHIND THE MASK
HAVE BEEN BOUNCING AROUND

08:17.584 --> 08:18.846
SOCIAL MEDIA...

08:18.889 --> 08:20.151
OH. GUYS.

08:20.195 --> 08:22.937
TOLD YOU
SHE DOESN'T KNOCK.

08:22.980 --> 08:25.026
I TAKE IT YOU SAW
MARQUIS' THREATS.

08:25.069 --> 08:27.507
I BELIEVE 10 MILLION PEOPLE
SAW MARQUIS' THREATS.

08:27.550 --> 08:29.509
HOW ON EARTH
DID HE HIJACK

08:29.552 --> 08:32.294
EVERY PHONE, TV,
AND LIVESTREAM
IN THIS CITY?

08:32.337 --> 08:33.556
HE GOT INTO THE BATCAVE.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.818
FROM THERE, HE FOUND
THE COMPUTER,

08:34.862 --> 08:36.385
WHICH LED TO WAYNE'S
SATELLITE,

08:36.428 --> 08:38.256
WHICH HE USED TO OVERRIDE
GOTHAM'S AIRWAVES.

08:38.300 --> 08:39.910
MY DAD CREATED THE TECH
IN THE EVENT

08:39.954 --> 08:41.999
THAT BATMAN HAD TO SEND
AN SOS TO EVERY PERSON

08:42.043 --> 08:43.610
IN THE CITY ALL AT ONCE.

08:43.653 --> 08:45.394
ANY CHANCE YOU CAN
TRACE THE ORIGINAL FEED

08:45.437 --> 08:46.874
BACK TO ITS LOCATION?

08:46.917 --> 08:48.136
WITHOUT ACCESS
TO THE BATCAVE, I WAS LUCKY

08:48.179 --> 08:49.790
TO BE ABLE TO GET
A SCREENCAP.

08:49.833 --> 08:52.183
WELL, THAT'S NOT
GONNA HELP US.

08:52.227 --> 08:54.142
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:54.185 --> 08:55.926
DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW YOUR FATHER

08:55.970 --> 08:58.059
ALWAYS REPEATED HIMSELF
WHEN HE GOT MAD?

08:58.102 --> 09:00.844
- VIVIDLY. WHY?
- I CAN HEAR HIM NOW.

09:00.888 --> 09:03.281
"JADA, JADA, JADA,
YOU LET MY BOY

09:03.325 --> 09:06.023
"TAKE ON MARQUIS
WITH A SMARTPHONE
AND A DIALUP?

09:06.067 --> 09:09.287
MM-MM-MM."

09:09.331 --> 09:11.333
I'M SURE MY TECH TEAM
CAN PULL

09:11.376 --> 09:15.859
A CARRIER-GRADE ROUTER
OFF JETURIAN'S SERVER FARM.

09:15.903 --> 09:19.167
UH...THANK YOU?

09:19.210 --> 09:20.777
WE DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF TIME.

09:20.821 --> 09:22.605
WE'VE GOT TO FIND
MARQUIS AND BUZZ HIM

09:22.649 --> 09:23.954
WITH THAT JOY BUZZER.

09:23.998 --> 09:25.390
WHERE'S RYAN?

09:25.434 --> 09:28.176
AHEM. THAT IS SUCH
A GOOD QUESTION.

09:28.219 --> 09:31.745
UH...WHERE'S RYAN?

09:31.788 --> 09:35.792
RIGHT. UH, SOPHIE,
DIDN'T RYAN TELL YOU
WHERE SHE WAS HEADED?

09:35.836 --> 09:37.098
UH, YES.
I BELIEVE SHE SAID

09:37.141 --> 09:38.621
SHE WAS RUNNING
AN ERRAND.

09:38.665 --> 09:40.188
RIGHT. THAT'S
WHAT I REMEMBER.

09:40.231 --> 09:43.191
ERRAND. DUH. SHE DID
MENTION AN ERRAND.

09:43.234 --> 09:44.801
WHERE WAS IT AGAIN?

09:44.845 --> 09:47.325
TELL ME WHY YOU
DESERVE THE JOY BUZZER.

09:47.369 --> 09:49.632
SHOULDN'T YOU BE
OUT ENJOYING YOUR
LAST FEW HOURS

09:49.676 --> 09:51.503
OF SUPERHERO
ANONYMITY?

09:51.547 --> 09:54.550
YEAH, I SHOULD.
INSTEAD, I'M HERE

09:54.594 --> 09:56.073
DOING MY BEST FRIEND
A SOLID

09:56.117 --> 09:57.814
WHILE THE PERSON
WHO ACTUALLY NEEDS IT

09:57.858 --> 09:59.207
IS OUT THERE THREATENING
TO DESTROY

09:59.250 --> 10:01.818
EVERYTHING I'VE WORKED FOR.

10:01.862 --> 10:03.515
OH, YOU MEAN
THE BROTHER
YOU'RE SCARED

10:03.559 --> 10:06.040
IS TOO GOOD
TO BE TRUE?

10:06.083 --> 10:09.043
FACE IT, RY-RY,
YOU CAN BLAME MARY
ALL YOU WANT,

10:09.086 --> 10:12.350
BUT DEEP DOWN
IN THAT LITTLE
ORPHAN HEART,

10:12.394 --> 10:14.526
YOU NEED ME
TO HAVE THAT THING.

10:14.570 --> 10:17.486
OH, WOW. MARY WAS RIGHT.
YOU DID STOP MAKING SENSE.

10:17.529 --> 10:19.227
OR...CHANCES ARE
YOU SPENT

10:19.270 --> 10:21.272
THE LAST FEW MONTHS
DAYDREAMING

10:21.316 --> 10:23.623
ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD
BE LIKE TO HAVE
A NUCLEAR FAMILY.

10:23.666 --> 10:25.537
THANKSGIVING DINNERS,

10:25.581 --> 10:27.670
FAMILY GAME NIGHTS,

10:27.714 --> 10:31.282
THE COMFORT OF A KIDNEY
SHOULD A NEW ONE
BECOME NECESSARY.

10:31.326 --> 10:34.590
YOUR DESPERATION'S SHOWING.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.680
WHAT IF YOU ZAP MARQUIS

10:37.724 --> 10:39.160
AND THAT GOOD
LITTLE BOY BURIED

10:39.203 --> 10:40.857
BENEATH THAT TACKY
CLOWN SUIT TURNS OUT

10:40.901 --> 10:43.077
TO BE DOING JUST FINE

10:43.120 --> 10:46.384
WITHOUT HIS NEEDY
LITTLE SISTER?

10:46.428 --> 10:48.604
DO YOU REALLY
WANT TO RISK GETTING
YOUR HOPES UP

10:48.648 --> 10:51.999
ONLY TO HAVE HIM
LEAVE YOU LIKE
EVERYBODY ELSE?

10:54.523 --> 10:58.396
I'M YOUR SAFE BET,
RYAN. HEH HEH.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.485
PSYCHO OR SANE,

11:00.529 --> 11:03.227
YOU DON'T NEED ME
TO LOVE YOU BACK.

11:15.762 --> 11:18.025
OUR STINGRAYS CAN
SIMULATE A CELL TOWER,

11:18.068 --> 11:19.635
AND SINCE OUR SUPERCOMPUTERS
ARE TOO BIG

11:19.679 --> 11:21.768
TO WALK THROUGH THAT DOOR,
YOU'LL NEED THIS,

11:21.811 --> 11:25.249
A SECURE ACCESS POINT
TO THE QUANTUM COMPUTER
AT GOTHAM UNIVERSITY.

11:25.293 --> 11:27.512
DID YOU SAY
QUANTUM COMPUTER?

11:27.556 --> 11:30.602
YOUR FATHER HAD ME FUND
THE COMPUTER LAB IT LIVES IN.

11:30.646 --> 11:33.649
IT SEEMS ONLY RIGHT
YOU USE IT.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.783
GREG, TELL HERSHEL
TO PULL THE GENERATOR
INTO THE ALLEY.

11:36.826 --> 11:38.306
YES, MA'AM.

11:38.349 --> 11:39.786
THIS PROCESSOR MAKES
THE BATCAVE LOOK LIKE

11:39.829 --> 11:41.309
IT RUNS
ON A HAMSTER WHEEL.

11:41.352 --> 11:42.963
WHERE WERE ALL
OF THESE RESOURCES

11:43.006 --> 11:44.747
WHEN JADA DIDN'T THINK
WE HAD THE JOY BUZZER?

11:44.791 --> 11:46.314
DIBS ON NOT BEING
THE ONE TO TELL HER.

11:46.357 --> 11:48.533
ANY UPDATE FROM RYAN?

11:48.577 --> 11:49.883
NOT YET.

11:52.973 --> 11:55.453
SO WHAT'S IT
GONNA BE, RY-RY?

11:55.497 --> 11:58.979
WOW. THIS WAS
A WASTE OF MY TIME.

11:59.022 --> 12:01.590
HAVE A NICE LIFE, ALICE.

12:01.633 --> 12:03.592
I DON'T DESERVE
THE JOY BUZZER, OK?

12:07.161 --> 12:09.641
WE BOTH KNOW THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANTED TO HEAR...

12:11.252 --> 12:13.297
BUT I DO HAVE A LITTLE
PIECE OF INFORMATION

12:13.341 --> 12:17.388
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
IF YOU WANT TO LIVE
TO SEE TOMORROW.

12:17.432 --> 12:19.216
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

12:22.263 --> 12:24.308
DARE I SAY IT'S
ACCURATE TO ASSUME

12:24.352 --> 12:27.834
THAT MARQUIS IS
HARBORING A...

12:27.877 --> 12:30.619
WEE, LITTLE MAN CRUSH
ON THE JOKER?

12:37.060 --> 12:40.411
GOT A HIT. HONING IN
ON MARQUIS' LOCATION NOW.

12:40.455 --> 12:41.848
HOW DOES THAT
MAKE SENSE?

12:41.891 --> 12:43.371
WHAT ARE ALL
OF THOSE?

12:43.414 --> 12:44.807
HIS SINGULAR CELL I.D.
IS PINGING OFF

12:44.851 --> 12:46.461
10 DIFFERENT SHOPS
IN GOTHAM SQUARE.

12:46.504 --> 12:48.245
ACCORDING
TO YOUR BROTHER,

12:48.289 --> 12:50.247
WHEN HE WAS 7,
THE JOKER JUMPED
ON HIS BUS

12:50.291 --> 12:52.815
AND WHISPERED
HIS BIG, EVIL PLAN

12:52.859 --> 12:55.862
TO DESTROY GOTHAM CITY
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

12:57.298 --> 12:59.822
UNFORTUNATELY
FOR THE JOKER,

12:59.866 --> 13:01.606
BATTY STOPPED HIM
AND DUMPED HIM
INTO ARKHAM

13:01.650 --> 13:03.086
BEFORE HE COULD
PULL IT OFF,

13:03.130 --> 13:07.090
BUT, UM, CURIOUS CATHY
OVER HERE

13:07.134 --> 13:09.614
WANDERED DOWN TO THE CAF

13:09.658 --> 13:11.573
AND ASKED A FEW
OF THE ARKHAM LIFERS

13:11.616 --> 13:14.271
IF MR. SMILEY PANTS
HAD EVER...

13:14.315 --> 13:18.145
TALKED ABOUT WHAT HE
HAD PLANNED ON DOING
THAT DAY.

13:18.188 --> 13:22.062
WOW. DID I EVER HEAR
THE MOST...

13:22.105 --> 13:24.281
INTERESTING RIDDLE.

13:24.325 --> 13:26.631
HE'S MOVING,
JUST REALLY, REALLY SLOW.

13:26.675 --> 13:28.546
CONVERTING COORDINATES,
ADDING ALTITUDE.

13:28.590 --> 13:30.070
HE'S NOT ON THE GROUND.
HE'S IN THE AIR.

13:30.113 --> 13:31.811
SO, WHAT? MARQUIS
TOOK THE WAYNE JET?

13:31.854 --> 13:33.116
WELL, IF THE WAYNE JET
MOVED THAT SLOW,

13:33.160 --> 13:34.639
IT WOULD FALL OUT
OF THE SKY.

13:36.467 --> 13:38.339
- NO.
- WHAT?

13:40.341 --> 13:43.213
NO. NO! NO!

13:43.257 --> 13:46.521
WHAT WAS IT?

13:46.564 --> 13:48.915
TEASE THEM
WITH A RIDDLE,

13:48.958 --> 13:51.918
GET THEM ALL OUTSIDE.

13:51.961 --> 13:57.445
WHAT'S WET AND MELTS
AND ISN'T SNOW

13:57.488 --> 13:59.577
BUT ENDS IN GENOCIDE?

14:01.449 --> 14:04.974
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
MY IDENTITY, IS IT?

14:07.237 --> 14:09.065
THAT WAS JUST THE DRAW.

14:11.154 --> 14:14.549
THIS...IS ABOUT
THE JOKER'S DESIRE

14:14.592 --> 14:17.769
TO PUNISH THE CITY
FOR WORSHIPING

14:17.813 --> 14:19.554
THE BAT SYMBOL.

14:26.474 --> 14:28.693
IT'S ABOUT KILLING
AS MANY PEOPLE

14:28.737 --> 14:31.392
AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE

14:31.435 --> 14:33.350
AND RIDDLING THIS CITY
WITH SURVIVORS

14:33.394 --> 14:35.309
THAT ARE AS UGLY
AS HIM.

14:35.352 --> 14:39.400
HOW? HOW DOES ONE PERSON
BLOW UP AN ENTIRE CITY?

14:39.443 --> 14:41.968
HE TOOK IT. IT'S GONE.

14:42.011 --> 14:43.708
HE MUST HAVE FOUND
THE LOCATION

14:43.752 --> 14:45.145
OF THE SECRET AIRSTRIP
IN THE BATCAVE'S RECORDS.

14:45.188 --> 14:47.321
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IT'S GONE? WHAT'S GONE?

14:47.364 --> 14:48.583
THE BATBLIMP.

15:33.236 --> 15:34.716
THE GAME'S CHANGED.

15:34.759 --> 15:36.674
THIS ISN'T
ABOUT MY IDENTITY.

15:36.718 --> 15:38.633
IT'S ABOUT LURING 10 MILLION
INNOCENT PEOPLE

15:38.676 --> 15:40.330
TO THEIR DEATHS.

15:40.374 --> 15:42.071
IN ONE HOUR, MARQUIS IS
DROPPING ACID BOMBS

15:42.115 --> 15:43.812
OVER THE CITY
AND DESTROYING EVERYTHING

15:43.855 --> 15:46.467
AND EVERYONE
IN ITS BLAST RADIUS,

15:46.510 --> 15:47.990
SO WE MAY BE IN A BAR
DEALING WITH THE FALLOUT

15:48.034 --> 15:50.645
OF BATMAN'S GREATEST ENEMY
WITHOUT A JOY BUZZER

15:50.688 --> 15:52.386
OR TIME TO THINK STRAIGHT,

15:52.429 --> 15:54.388
BUT WE DON'T
GET EXCUSES.

15:54.431 --> 15:57.521
- NO ONE DIES TODAY. AM I CLEAR?
- CRYSTAL.

15:57.565 --> 16:00.655
GOOD. ANY CHANCE YOU CAN
HACK INTO THE CONTROLS
OF THE BATBLIMP?

16:00.698 --> 16:02.135
I'VE NEVER ONCE SEEN
THE BLIMP'S INTERFACE,

16:02.178 --> 16:03.658
BUT IT'S POSSIBLE
THE COORDINATES

16:03.701 --> 16:05.181
ARE VULNERABLE TO
AN ISMI CATCHER.

16:05.225 --> 16:06.661
- NEED A YES OR NO.
- I CAN'T LAND IT,

16:06.704 --> 16:07.879
BUT I CAN PROBABLY
GET IT CLOSE.

16:07.923 --> 16:09.446
CLOSE IS ALL WE NEED.

16:09.490 --> 16:11.753
I NEED YOU TO DIRECT IT
TO THE GCPD ROOFTOP.

16:11.796 --> 16:13.276
WHY? WHAT ARE YOU
PLANNING?

16:13.320 --> 16:14.712
SO YOU CAN STOP ME?

16:14.756 --> 16:16.236
IT'S THAT CRAZY?

16:16.279 --> 16:18.020
LOOK AT YOU FIGURING
ME OUT ALREADY.

16:18.064 --> 16:20.109
NO TIME FOR DETAILS.
BESIDES, I NEED YOU AND MARY

16:20.153 --> 16:22.242
TO PUT YOUR BRAINS TOGETHER
TO GET EVERYONE IN THE CITY

16:22.285 --> 16:25.158
TO TAKE COVER WITHOUT
INCITING A CHAOS MOB.

16:25.201 --> 16:27.943
HOW? NOT TO THROW
SHADE ON MY OWN
SEX APPEAL HERE,

16:27.987 --> 16:30.076
BUT YOU KNOW I
ONLY HAVE, LIKE,
300 FOLLOWERS

16:30.119 --> 16:32.992
ON SOCIALS, RIGHT?

16:33.035 --> 16:35.385
THE BATMAN TROPHIES.

16:35.429 --> 16:37.083
CHANCES ARE MARQUIS
CLEANED HOUSE

16:37.126 --> 16:38.998
ON THE BATWEAPONS,
BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS

16:39.041 --> 16:40.608
TO THE WING
WITH THE TROPHY ROOM

16:40.651 --> 16:42.305
WITHOUT BATWOMAN'S DNA.

16:42.349 --> 16:45.047
- SO?
- SO BETWEEN THE MAD HATTER'S HAT

16:45.091 --> 16:47.310
AND THE CONDIMENT KING'S
GUN, SURELY THERE'S

16:47.354 --> 16:49.443
SOME KOOKY TOOL IN THERE
THAT CAN INFLUENCE

16:49.486 --> 16:50.966
PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOR.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.881
OK. LET'S
SAY THERE WERE.

16:52.924 --> 16:55.057
HOW THE HELL DO
WE GET INTO
THE BATCAVE?

16:55.101 --> 16:56.798
I'M SURE MARQUIS
QUADRUPLED SECURITY

16:56.841 --> 16:58.278
SINCE BATWING AND I
GOT BUSTED

16:58.321 --> 17:00.497
BREAKING INTO WAYNE.

17:00.541 --> 17:03.065
JADA'S REALLY NOT HAPPY
WITH ME,

17:03.109 --> 17:05.111
BUT I MAY HAVE AN IDEA.

17:11.421 --> 17:12.901
I'M SORRY.

17:16.557 --> 17:19.255
WHEN YOU SAID WE'D
GET OUR FAMILY BACK,

17:19.299 --> 17:20.691
I TRUSTED YOU.

17:20.735 --> 17:22.476
WE WILL GET
OUR FAMILY BACK.

17:22.519 --> 17:25.914
HOW? THAT BUZZER WAS
THE ONLY WAY TO SAVE MARQUIS.

17:25.957 --> 17:28.090
YOU KNEW THAT,
AND YOU STILL GAVE IT AWAY.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.918
HAVING THAT BUZZER
IN OUR POSSESSION

17:29.961 --> 17:31.485
WOULDN'T CHANGE
THE FACT THAT A BLIMP

17:31.528 --> 17:33.095
HOVERING OVER OUR CITY
IS ABOUT TO DOUSE

17:33.139 --> 17:35.402
OUR STREETS WITH
THE JOKER'S ACID BOMBS.

17:35.445 --> 17:37.578
WE NEED TO GET PEOPLE
TO SAFETY.

17:37.621 --> 17:39.493
I HAVE CONNECTIONS, RYAN,

17:39.536 --> 17:41.973
BUT I HIGHLY DOUBT
THE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES

17:42.017 --> 17:43.366
IS GOING TO TAKE
MY CALL.

17:43.410 --> 17:45.455
I DON'T NEED
THE PRESIDENT.

17:45.499 --> 17:47.414
I NEED MY MOM

17:47.457 --> 17:49.155
TO PICK UP HER PHONE

17:49.198 --> 17:51.505
AND GET ME WAYNE
ENTERPRISES BACK.

17:51.548 --> 17:54.725
DO TO HIM WHAT YOU
DID TO ME.

17:54.769 --> 17:57.989
IF IT WERE THAT SIMPLE,
I WOULD HAVE DONE IT
WEEKS AGO.

17:58.033 --> 18:03.430
MARQUIS IS SMART.
HIS ACCOUNTING IS BULLETPROOF.

18:03.473 --> 18:06.998
AND I'M GUESSING
HE'S NOT HIDING

18:07.042 --> 18:09.349
A BILLION-DOLLAR
VIGILANTE FUND.

18:11.481 --> 18:16.921
NO, BUT HE IS HIDING
SOMETHING--

18:16.965 --> 18:19.359
THE UGLY TRUTH.

18:19.402 --> 18:23.145
JADA...
IF YOU DO MEAN

18:23.189 --> 18:24.929
WHAT I THINK
YOU MEAN,

18:24.973 --> 18:26.409
THERE COULD BE
SERIOUS RAMIFICATIONS

18:26.453 --> 18:28.846
FOR YOU, TOO.

18:28.890 --> 18:33.677
I'VE RISKED EVERYTHING
TO PROTECT MY SON AND FAILED.

18:33.721 --> 18:37.420
IT'S TIME I TAKE A PAGE
FROM MY DAUGHTER'S HANDBOOK.

18:37.464 --> 18:39.640
IT'S TIME TO PUT
THE CITY FIRST.

18:49.302 --> 18:53.741
IT'S NEVER GOOD WHEN YOUR CFO
CALLS YOU AT MARTINI O'CLOCK.

18:53.784 --> 18:55.046
YEAH.

18:57.745 --> 19:00.139
WHO SAID THAT?

19:00.182 --> 19:02.532
HEH. UH-HUH.

19:02.576 --> 19:05.709
YOU THINK YOU CAN FIRE ME?

19:05.753 --> 19:08.582
YOU AND WHO ELSE?

19:08.625 --> 19:12.847
OH! THE DOJ. HA HA HA!

19:12.890 --> 19:15.632
THAT'S RICH. YEAH.
HAVE FUN WITH THAT.

19:23.988 --> 19:25.773
MARQUIS JET'S
OWN MOTHER,

19:25.816 --> 19:27.514
BUSINESS TYCOON JADA JET,

19:27.557 --> 19:30.995
JUST ADMITTED TO
THE DECADES-LONG FAMILY SECRET.

19:31.039 --> 19:33.607
3 YEARS AGO, FRANKLIN JET
WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD

19:33.650 --> 19:35.348
AFTER A FALL.

19:35.391 --> 19:38.133
THESE ALLEGATIONS NOW
THROW THAT INTO QUESTION.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.570
MEANWHILE, THE WAYNE BOARD
HAS UNANIMOUSLY

19:40.614 --> 19:44.270
REAPPOINTED RYAN WILDER
TO THE CEO POSITION,

19:44.313 --> 19:47.316
CALLING HER PREVIOUS
RESIGNATION COERCED.

19:47.360 --> 19:51.102
THAT POSITION WOULD BE
REINSTATED IMMEDIATELY. MS--

19:55.106 --> 19:58.893
HEH. YOU THINK I CARE
ABOUT WAYNE OR--OR--OR FAMILY

19:58.936 --> 20:00.590
OR ANY OF YOU IDIOTS?!

20:05.769 --> 20:08.903
DON'T YOU GET IT?

20:08.946 --> 20:10.557
NONE OF YOU MATTER ANYMORE.

20:13.299 --> 20:16.215
LUKE, WE'RE IN.
JADA'S PLAY WORKED.

20:16.258 --> 20:19.261
WAYNE TOWER WAS
POSTAPOCALYPTIC.

20:19.305 --> 20:22.264
SO...READY TO TEACH ME
HOW TO DO THIS?

20:24.440 --> 20:26.964
LUKE? HELLO?
BATCAVE TO LUKE.

20:27.008 --> 20:28.836
YEP. I COPY.
JUST FURIOUSLY HACKING

20:28.879 --> 20:30.490
INTO A NUCLEAR BATBLIMP
FROM A BARSTOOL.

20:30.533 --> 20:32.274
APOLOGIES
FOR THE 3-SECOND DELAY.

20:32.318 --> 20:34.668
OK. I'M AT THE COMPUTER.

20:34.711 --> 20:37.453
TELL ME HOW MARQUIS WAS
ABLE TO HIJACK THE AIRWAVES.

20:49.813 --> 20:52.599
OK. ARE YOU LOOKING
AT THE SATELLITE
ACCESS PORTAL?

20:52.642 --> 20:55.993
UH, THE THING
WITH THE DOTS
AND THE NUMBERS?

20:56.037 --> 20:58.169
LET'S ASSUME YES.
SO YOU'RE GONNA
GET A PROMPT.

20:58.213 --> 20:59.562
THEN YOU NEED TO
CLAIM ACCESS

20:59.606 --> 21:01.347
TO EACH
OF THE SATELLITES.

21:01.390 --> 21:03.087
UH...

21:03.131 --> 21:04.654
JUST CLICK THE BOX NEXT
TO THE SATELLITE FILE.

21:04.698 --> 21:06.700
OK. CLICKING BOXES.

21:09.703 --> 21:11.835
IT'S KIND OF CREEPY
HOW EASY THIS IS.

21:11.879 --> 21:14.577
WELL, CONSIDERING
I JUST HAD TO REMIND YOU
WHERE THE POWER SWITCH WAS--

21:14.621 --> 21:16.362
OK. TEAM DOCTOR,
NOT THE TECHIE.

21:16.405 --> 21:19.190
I'D LIKE TO SEE
ONE OF YOUR PATIENT
INTAKE REPORTS.

21:19.234 --> 21:21.062
- I MISSED THIS.
- WHAT? ME FUMBLING

21:21.105 --> 21:24.935
OVER THIS ELECTRONIC
PAPERWEIGHT YOU CALL
A COMPUTER?

21:24.979 --> 21:26.241
US.

21:29.505 --> 21:31.290
ME, TOO.

21:45.565 --> 21:49.351
OK. I'M TWO CLICKS AWAY
FROM CONTROLLING
GOTHAM'S AIRWAVES.

21:50.874 --> 21:53.137
OK. COOL. WHAT DID
SOPHIE LAND ON?

21:55.270 --> 21:58.708
THE PENGUIN'S UMBRELLA.

21:58.752 --> 22:00.971
INDUCING GOTHAM
INTO A HYPNOTIC STATE

22:01.015 --> 22:02.364
VIA EYE FASCINATION.

22:02.408 --> 22:03.757
I MEAN, THAT--
THAT'S BRILLIANT.

22:05.889 --> 22:07.543
OK. HEY. UH, GET
YOUR HYPNO ON.

22:07.587 --> 22:09.023
I JUST GOT INTO THE BLIMP.

22:09.066 --> 22:10.285
BATBAR TO BATWOMAN.

22:13.767 --> 22:15.595
- JUST LANDED.
- ALL RIGHT. I'M IN.

22:15.638 --> 22:16.987
I'M ENTERING
YOUR COORDINATES NOW.

22:17.031 --> 22:18.554
LET ME KNOW
WHEN YOU SEE IT.

22:20.861 --> 22:22.341
YEAH.

22:26.083 --> 22:27.607
GOT EYES.

22:50.194 --> 22:52.240
AH. I LOVE YOU MORONS.

22:55.069 --> 22:56.592
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

22:56.636 --> 23:00.248
HEY. HEY!

23:00.291 --> 23:01.945
WHY DID WE DROP?

23:01.989 --> 23:03.599
I HAVE NO IDEA,
MR. JET.

23:03.643 --> 23:05.471
COMPUTER CHANGED COORDINATES
AND LOCKED ME OUT.

23:05.514 --> 23:07.211
WELL, THEN PUT IT
IN AUTOPILOT.

23:07.255 --> 23:08.561
I DID. NOTHING IS
WORKING, SIR.

23:08.604 --> 23:09.866
IT'S TOTALLY DEAD.

23:11.215 --> 23:12.826
GUESS YOU TWO
HAVE THAT IN COMMON.

23:15.959 --> 23:19.049
LUKE, I NEED THIS THING
TO BE A LOT LOWER.

23:19.093 --> 23:21.095
YEAH. TRYING.
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

23:21.138 --> 23:23.532
I'M LITERALLY STARING
AT A TICKING CLOCK HERE.

23:23.576 --> 23:25.360
YEAH. I LOST ACCESS.
EVERYTHING JUST
DROPPED OFFLINE.

23:25.404 --> 23:26.796
I NEED SOME TIME
TO GET BACK IN.

23:26.840 --> 23:29.538
WE DON'T HAVE TIME.

23:29.582 --> 23:31.235
WISH ME LUCK.

23:31.279 --> 23:32.672
WHOA, WHOA, HEY, HEY!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:32.715 --> 23:34.064
TAKING THE SCENIC ROUTE.

23:34.108 --> 23:35.414
LORD, HELP ME.

23:51.299 --> 23:54.171
I'M IN THE CARGO HOLD NOW.

23:54.215 --> 23:55.521
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

23:58.175 --> 23:59.612
PLEASE TELL ME
THEY TAUGHT YOU

23:59.655 --> 24:01.614
HOW TO DISARM A BOMB
AT POINT ROCK.

24:01.657 --> 24:03.006
GET ME EYES ON IT.

24:05.531 --> 24:07.228
HALF A DOZEN DRUMS.

24:09.491 --> 24:11.188
ALL ATTACHED TO A TIMER
THAT TELLS ME

24:11.232 --> 24:13.016
WE HAVE LESS
THAN 15 MINUTES

24:13.060 --> 24:15.497
BEFORE MARQUIS MAKES IT
RAIN ACID ALL OVER GOTHAM.

24:15.541 --> 24:17.151
WHERE DO I START?

24:19.327 --> 24:21.068
- YOU DON'T.
- OK. I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING

24:21.111 --> 24:22.896
MORE LIKE
CUT THE GREEN OR PURPLE.

24:22.939 --> 24:24.593
I COUNT AT LEAST
4 TRIPWIRES

24:24.637 --> 24:26.508
THAT WOULD SET
THIS OFF EARLY,

24:26.552 --> 24:28.467
NOT TO MENTION ANY
OTHER NASTY HIDDEN
SURPRISES

24:28.510 --> 24:29.903
THE JOKER MIGHT HAVE
LEFT BEHIND.

24:29.946 --> 24:31.513
YOU TOUCH ANY ONE
OF THOSE WIRES,

24:31.557 --> 24:33.472
THE WHOLE DAMN THING
COULD GO.

24:36.039 --> 24:38.128
WHERE THE HELL ARE WE
WITH EVACING THE CITY?

24:38.172 --> 24:40.479
I'M JUST ABOUT TO ACCESS
WAYNE SECURITY MAINFRAME

24:40.522 --> 24:44.134
AND DROP A HOT TIP...NOW.

24:51.272 --> 24:53.187
AUTOMATED VOICE:
GET UNDERGROUND IMMEDIATELY.

24:53.230 --> 24:56.059
TAKE COVER.
WAIT FOR INSTRUCTIONS.

24:56.103 --> 24:57.887
GET UNDERGROUND IMMEDIATELY.

24:57.931 --> 25:00.716
TAKE COVER.
WAIT FOR INSTRUCTIONS.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.544
GET UNDERGROUND IMMEDIATELY.

25:02.588 --> 25:05.547
TAKE COVER.
WAIT FOR INSTRUCTIONS.

25:05.591 --> 25:07.418
GET UNDERGROUND IMMEDIATELY.

25:07.462 --> 25:10.160
TAKE COVER.
WAIT FOR INSTRUCTIONS.

25:11.510 --> 25:14.382
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S WORKING.

25:14.425 --> 25:17.733
THE PENGUIN'S UMBRELLA
IS ACTUALLY HYPNOTIZING
PEOPLE TO TAKE COVER.

25:17.777 --> 25:19.430
YOU HEAR THAT,
BATWOMAN?

25:19.474 --> 25:21.215
WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS.
YOU OUT OF THERE YET?

25:21.258 --> 25:23.522
I'M GONNA TRY TO REROUTE
THE BLIMP OVER THE OCEAN.

25:32.095 --> 25:34.794
OK. TELL ME YOU LEARNED
HOW TO WIRE

25:34.837 --> 25:36.970
A BLIMP'S CONTROLS
AT POINT ROCK.

25:37.013 --> 25:38.754
PRETTY SURE PILOT
A GIANT COMBUSTIBLE
BALLOON WASN'T

25:38.798 --> 25:40.713
OFFERED
IN BASIC TRAINING.

25:40.756 --> 25:42.628
THIS THING BLOWS,

25:42.671 --> 25:44.586
ACID'S STILL GONNA RAIN DOWN
OVER THE CITY.

25:44.630 --> 25:46.457
ONCE MARQUIS
REALIZES WE TOOK
AWAY HIS AUDIENCE,

25:46.501 --> 25:48.198
HE COULD
TRIGGER THE BOMB
AT ANY MOMENT

25:48.242 --> 25:49.591
WITH YOU STILL
INSIDE.

25:49.635 --> 25:51.114
I CAN'T JUST WALK
AWAY FROM THIS.

25:51.158 --> 25:52.855
I'M NOT LOSING
YOU, RYAN!

25:54.727 --> 25:57.120
YOU DON'T GET TO PLAY
THE CRAZY CARD WITH ME.

25:59.514 --> 26:01.908
I'M NOT LOSING YOU.

26:01.951 --> 26:04.519
NOBODY'S EVER SAID
THAT TO ME BEFORE.

26:04.563 --> 26:07.609
AND NOBODY
EVER WILL AGAIN.

26:07.653 --> 26:09.219
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
YOU HAD SOMETHING TO DO

26:09.263 --> 26:10.960
WITH WHAT'S GOING ON
BELOW.

26:11.004 --> 26:13.920
SEE, THIS IS WHY
I NEVER WANTED
A LITTLE SISTER.

26:13.963 --> 26:16.879
THEY RUIN ALL THE FUN.

26:16.923 --> 26:19.490
YOUR DEFINITION OF FUN IS
BLOWING UP HALF OF GOTHAM?

26:19.534 --> 26:21.623
WHOA. WHY
SO PESSIMISTIC?

26:21.667 --> 26:24.147
THAT MEANS HALF
THE ISLAND LIVES

26:24.191 --> 26:25.845
TO REMEMBER THE DAY
THAT THE BATBLIMP

26:25.888 --> 26:27.629
DISFIGURED THEM
BEYOND RECOGNITION

26:27.673 --> 26:29.326
AND BATWOMAN DIDN'T
SAVE THEM.

26:29.370 --> 26:30.850
ERR! UNH!

26:44.080 --> 26:45.647
DISARM THE BOMB.

26:45.691 --> 26:47.257
EVERYONE'S TAKEN COVER
ALREADY.

26:47.301 --> 26:49.216
- YOUR PLAN FAILED!
- YOUR PLAN FAILED!

26:49.259 --> 26:50.696
YOUR PLAN TO WEASEL
IN ON MY LIFE

26:50.739 --> 26:52.045
AND STEAL MOMMY AWAY?

26:52.088 --> 26:53.394
HARD FAIL, SIS!

26:53.437 --> 26:55.048
DISARM THE BOMB, MARQUIS!

26:55.091 --> 26:56.484
W-W-WHAT IS THIS,
YOUR LAST ATTEMPT

26:56.527 --> 26:57.964
TO WIN JADA'S LOVE?

26:58.007 --> 27:00.053
HUH? YOU--YOU SAVE
HER SCREWED UP SON

27:00.096 --> 27:01.881
AND THEN MAYBE
SHE'LL APOLOGIZE

27:01.924 --> 27:04.361
FOR LEAVING YOU
IN A DROPBOX?

27:04.405 --> 27:06.407
SHE DOESN'T
LOVE YOU, WILDER!

27:06.450 --> 27:07.713
TAKE THE HINT!

27:28.472 --> 27:29.952
I'M NOT DOING THIS
FOR JADA.

27:29.996 --> 27:32.520
RIGHT. THE HERO'S
BURDEN. I FORGOT.

27:32.563 --> 27:33.956
YOU'RE DOING THIS
FOR MANKIND!

27:34.000 --> 27:35.654
I'M DOING IT
FOR MY FAMILY.

27:38.700 --> 27:40.441
HA HA HA HA HA HA!

27:40.484 --> 27:42.661
GIVE ME MY BROTHER BACK!

27:44.140 --> 27:48.101
GIVE...HIM...BACK!

27:48.144 --> 27:51.757
PLEASE. I WANT MARQUIS.
PLEASE!

27:53.584 --> 27:54.847
I'M SORRY.

27:59.329 --> 28:00.853
I'M SORRY.

28:12.908 --> 28:14.605
I'M SORRY...

28:14.649 --> 28:16.564
THAT YOU'RE SO
DESPERATE FOR A FAMILY

28:16.607 --> 28:19.088
THAT YOU BELIEVED
YOU COULD SAVE ME!

28:19.132 --> 28:21.047
AAH!

28:22.788 --> 28:24.572
HA HA HA!

28:34.321 --> 28:36.018
HA HA HA--OHH!

28:53.427 --> 28:54.645
BATWOMAN?

29:02.392 --> 29:05.613
RYAN? RYAN, ARE
YOU THERE? CHECK IN.

29:07.397 --> 29:09.965
RYAN. RYAN, TALK
TO ME, PLEASE.

29:10.009 --> 29:12.011
SAY SOMETHING.
ARE YOU OK?

29:14.013 --> 29:17.320
YOU THINK I'M GONNA DIE
BEFORE YOU BUY ME DINNER?

29:25.502 --> 29:26.765
UNH.

29:28.679 --> 29:29.942
THE BOMB.

29:29.985 --> 29:31.813
WE'RE ON IT.

29:53.400 --> 29:54.880
THIS IS WORSE
THAN I THOUGHT.

29:54.923 --> 29:56.664
CAN YOU REWIRE
THE CONTROLS?

29:59.710 --> 30:01.277
NOT IN TWO MINUTES.

30:01.321 --> 30:02.757
I NEED TO INSTALL
A WHOLE NEW OPERATING SYSTEM

30:02.801 --> 30:04.106
TO STEER THIS THING
OUT OF THE CITY.

30:04.150 --> 30:05.716
BUT YOU'RE LUKE.
THERE'S ALWAYS SOME

30:05.760 --> 30:06.979
SUPERGENIUS GIGABYTE-FILLED
RABBIT IN A HAT

30:07.022 --> 30:08.719
SOMEWHERE, RIGHT?

30:08.763 --> 30:10.069
RIGHT.

30:11.984 --> 30:14.160
YOU'RE RIGHT.

30:14.203 --> 30:15.726
MY HELMET'S AI.

30:15.770 --> 30:18.642
WHOA. OK.
IT CAN DO THAT?

30:18.686 --> 30:20.557
WELL, MY DAD DESIGNED
THE BATTECH

30:20.601 --> 30:23.343
TO TALK TO EACH OTHER.

30:23.386 --> 30:25.127
THE AI IS THE ONLY THING

30:25.171 --> 30:28.870
THAT COULD OVERRIDE
THIS NAV SYSTEM IN TIME.

30:28.914 --> 30:30.480
IF I CAN DOCK IT
TO THE MAINFRAME,

30:30.524 --> 30:31.917
WE MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE
A FIGHTING CHANCE.

30:31.960 --> 30:34.745
WAIT. DOCK IT?
AS IN LEAVE IT BEHIND?

30:34.789 --> 30:36.051
ONLY WAY THIS WORKS.

30:36.095 --> 30:37.792
BUT, LUKE, THAT'S
YOUR DAD.

30:42.144 --> 30:44.451
SOPHIE...GIVE ME
A DIRECTION I CAN GET TO

30:44.494 --> 30:46.583
IN 2 MINUTES
AND 15 SECONDS.

30:46.627 --> 30:48.324
COPY. I'M ON IT.

30:52.894 --> 30:54.243
- HUH!
- UNH!

30:59.945 --> 31:02.904
HA HA HA!

31:02.948 --> 31:05.864
DO BATS HAVE
9 LIVES, TOO?

31:05.907 --> 31:08.388
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
YOU CAN HOLD US UP
MUCH LONGER.

31:09.955 --> 31:11.782
YOU WILLING TO
KILL ME

31:11.826 --> 31:14.089
OR DIE FOR ME, SIS?

31:14.133 --> 31:18.267
NOT...LETTING GO.

31:21.140 --> 31:22.924
IS IT JUST ME,
OR IS THIS EVIL PLAN

31:22.968 --> 31:25.840
UNFOLDING EXACTLY
AS I CALLED IT?

31:28.669 --> 31:30.018
LOOK AT ME DOING
SOMETHING OUT

31:30.062 --> 31:31.890
OF THE GOODNESS
OF MY HEART.

31:31.933 --> 31:33.413
I'M SURPRISED YOU DIDN'T
SPONTANEOUSLY BURST
INTO FLAMES.

31:33.456 --> 31:34.936
IT MUST MEAN I'VE
REALLY CHANGED.

31:34.980 --> 31:36.329
DID THIS EARN ME
THE BUZZER OR WHAT?

31:36.372 --> 31:38.897
YOU REALLY WILLING
TO DITCH THE BITCH?

31:38.940 --> 31:40.463
I WATCHED MY MOM'S
HEAD

31:40.507 --> 31:42.030
BOBBING DOWN A RIVER,

31:42.074 --> 31:43.771
ENDURED A LIFE SENTENCE

31:43.814 --> 31:45.077
IN A MONSTER'S BASEMENT

31:45.120 --> 31:46.730
AND HAD MY HEAD
SCRAMBLED

31:46.774 --> 31:48.210
BY A WOMAN SCORNED.

31:48.254 --> 31:51.257
NOW I'M COMING
TO YOU OF ALL PEOPLE

31:51.300 --> 31:54.303
FOR SOME MAGIC KEY
TO MAKE THE CRAZY
GO POOF.

31:55.826 --> 31:58.003
THAT MUST SHOW YOU
HOW DESPERATE I AM.

31:58.046 --> 31:59.961
I DON'T SEE DESPERATE.
I SEE A GIRL

32:00.005 --> 32:01.397
WHO LIVED
A HELL OF A LIFE

32:01.441 --> 32:03.704
CAPABLE OF CHANGE.

32:03.747 --> 32:06.185
I CAN'T...DO IT
ON MY OWN!

32:06.228 --> 32:08.709
NO. YOU DON'T WANT TO
DO IT ON YOUR OWN

32:08.752 --> 32:11.407
BECAUSE IT'S HARD,
BUT IF ANYONE CAN SURVIVE

32:11.451 --> 32:13.801
HARD, ALICE, IT'S YOU.

32:18.023 --> 32:20.329
THIS...IS FOR MARY,

32:20.373 --> 32:21.983
BUT DEEP DOWN,
MARY KNOWS

32:22.027 --> 32:23.898
AND I KNOW AND YOU KNOW

32:23.942 --> 32:26.379
YOU ARE NOT THE ONE
WHO NEEDS THIS.

32:31.079 --> 32:32.298
UGH.

32:36.302 --> 32:38.957
AAH! ERR!

32:51.752 --> 32:53.754
THANK YOU.

32:53.797 --> 32:55.103
I MEAN IT.

32:57.758 --> 32:59.716
TO BE CLEAR...

32:59.760 --> 33:02.850
WE STILL AREN'T
FRIENDS,

33:02.893 --> 33:05.461
AND I CAN'T HELP
YOU WITH THAT.

33:10.901 --> 33:12.338
LESS THAN
A MINUTE, BATWING.

33:12.381 --> 33:13.992
HOW MUCH LONGER
BEFORE IT'S OPERATIONAL?

33:17.299 --> 33:20.520
AI's IN.
JUST NEED COORDINATES.

33:20.563 --> 33:22.478
SOPHIE, NOW.

33:22.522 --> 33:24.045
THESE CALCULATIONS
WERE MADE WHEN WE

33:24.089 --> 33:25.829
STILL HAD TWO MINUTES
ON THE CLOCK.

33:25.873 --> 33:27.440
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WE DON'T HAVE TIME

33:27.483 --> 33:28.963
TO GET IT OUT
OF GOTHAM?

33:29.007 --> 33:31.574
BATCAVE,
I NEED A DIRECTION ASAP!

33:31.618 --> 33:33.228
20 SECONDS.

33:33.272 --> 33:35.013
SOPHIE! COORDINATES!

33:35.056 --> 33:37.624
OK. UM,
40 DEGREES NORTH,

33:37.667 --> 33:39.756
73 DEGREES WEST.

33:39.800 --> 33:41.280
IF WE CAN'T GET IT
TO THE OCEAN,

33:41.323 --> 33:42.542
WE CAN AT LEAST GET
IT TO THE CITY'S

33:42.585 --> 33:44.761
MOST DESOLATE AREA.

33:44.805 --> 33:46.415
IT'S WORKING.

33:46.459 --> 33:48.026
NOW GET OUT OF THERE.

33:52.508 --> 33:54.467
YOU INSPIRED ME
TO BE A HERO.

33:57.122 --> 33:58.297
THANKS, DAD.

33:58.340 --> 34:00.038
I'M PROUD
OF YOU, SON.

34:00.081 --> 34:02.127
YOU AND YOUR TEAM WILL SAVE
A LOT OF LIVES TONIGHT.

34:02.170 --> 34:03.867
NOW GO SAVE YOURS.

34:22.538 --> 34:24.714
BATCAVE TO BATWING,
DO YOU READ?

34:24.758 --> 34:26.281
BATWING, CHECK IN.
ARE YOU OK?

34:31.634 --> 34:34.246
I'M HERE.
I GOT OUT OF THERE.

34:38.337 --> 34:40.382
- HELLO?
- HEY.

34:40.426 --> 34:41.775
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING OUT HERE?

34:41.818 --> 34:43.168
GOT SPLIT UP
FROM MY MOM.

34:43.211 --> 34:45.387
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE SHE WENT.

34:45.431 --> 34:48.347
OK. I'LL HELP YOU
FIND HER.

34:48.390 --> 34:51.089
WHO ARE YOU ANYWAY?

34:51.132 --> 34:52.525
CALL ME BATWING.

34:57.095 --> 34:58.922
HOW IS HE?

34:58.966 --> 35:01.011
HIS VITALS
ARE STABLE.

35:01.055 --> 35:03.405
PHYSICALLY,
HE'S OK,

35:03.449 --> 35:05.755
BUT UNTIL HE
WAKES UP,

35:05.799 --> 35:07.453
WE WON'T KNOW IF
THE BUZZER WORKED.

35:12.414 --> 35:14.068
IT'S GOING TO WORK.

35:17.593 --> 35:21.031
THANK YOU FOR
FINDING A WAY TO
MAKE THIS HAPPEN.

35:21.075 --> 35:24.339
I TOLD YOU YOU COULD
TRUST ME.

35:24.383 --> 35:29.388
RYAN...DESPITE
MY MISTAKES,

35:29.431 --> 35:34.871
YOU HAVE EXCEEDED
MY WILDEST DREAMS.

35:34.915 --> 35:36.699
I CAN'T CHANGE
THE PAST,

35:36.743 --> 35:39.920
BUT MAYBE WE CAN BUILD
A DIFFERENT FUTURE.

35:41.487 --> 35:43.053
I'D LIKE THAT.

35:47.928 --> 35:49.712
MARQUIS?

35:49.756 --> 35:52.933
BABY, CAN YOU
HEAR ME?

35:57.155 --> 35:58.939
HI, MOM.

36:05.293 --> 36:07.774
HEY, SIS.

36:07.817 --> 36:09.558
NICE TO MEET YOU
FOR REAL.

36:11.386 --> 36:13.997
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

36:14.041 --> 36:15.608
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

36:19.133 --> 36:21.091
LIKE I NEED
MY LITTLE SISTER.

36:31.363 --> 36:32.929
SERIOUSLY?

36:44.941 --> 36:46.726
GOOD FOR YOU, BETH.

37:05.962 --> 37:07.921
SO WHAT NEXT?

37:07.964 --> 37:09.531
WELL, NOW THAT WE'VE
GOT WAYNE BACK,

37:09.575 --> 37:12.708
WHAT'S NEXT IS RECLAIMING
THIS SPACE

37:12.752 --> 37:15.494
AS IN WHAT IS UP
WITH TACKY-ASS TV

37:15.537 --> 37:17.800
COVERING
MY STAINED GLASS?

37:17.844 --> 37:22.283
I MEAN...WHAT'S
NEXT FOR US?

37:22.327 --> 37:26.461
WELL, I THOUGHT WE AGREED
YOU WERE GONNA BUY ME DINNER.

37:33.947 --> 37:36.515
BROUGHT THE CHAMPS!

37:36.558 --> 37:39.518
AND WE'RE
INTERRUPTING.

37:39.561 --> 37:41.302
THIS IS GONNA KEEP
HAPPENING, ISN'T IT?

37:41.346 --> 37:42.825
- PROBABLY.
- PROBABLY.

37:42.869 --> 37:45.001
WELL, I FOR ONE
AM NOT GONNA LET

37:45.045 --> 37:47.134
A SLIGHTLY AWKWARD
SENSATION GET
IN THE WAY

37:47.177 --> 37:49.005
OF OUR RARE
OPPORTUNITY

37:49.049 --> 37:51.312
TO CELEBRATE!

37:51.356 --> 37:53.488
I'M ACTUALLY GLAD
YOU'RE ALL HERE.

37:53.532 --> 37:56.012
I NEED YOUR HELP
GETTING THIS PLACE

37:56.056 --> 37:57.884
RIGHT AGAIN.

37:57.927 --> 38:01.975
STARTING WITH THIS.

38:02.018 --> 38:05.065
WOMAN:

38:18.948 --> 38:20.602
THAT'S BETTER.

38:20.646 --> 38:24.563
SO DO I WANT TO KNOW WHAT
HE DID TO OUR BATCAVE?

38:24.606 --> 38:26.695
DOESN'T BATWOMAN
TAKE A NIGHT OFF?

38:26.739 --> 38:31.352
THIS IS GOTHAM, HOME
OF THE INFECTIOUS REPTILE TEETH,

38:31.396 --> 38:33.876
DUDES IN PIG MASKS,

38:33.920 --> 38:36.836
A KILLER VINE CAUSING
MY BESTIE TO GET HER BADDIE ON.

38:36.879 --> 38:39.665
IF I HAVE LEARNED ANYTHING,

38:39.708 --> 38:43.364
IT IS TO BE PREPARED
FOR EVERYTHING AT ALL TIMES.

38:43.408 --> 38:44.496
ARE Y'ALL WITH ME?

38:44.539 --> 38:46.411
WE'RE WITH YOU,
BATWOMAN.

38:46.454 --> 38:48.195
WHERE ELSE
WOULD WE BE?

38:49.892 --> 38:53.809
YEAH. OH. I THOUGHT
WE WERE DRINKING.

38:53.853 --> 38:55.376
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

38:55.420 --> 38:58.205

38:58.248 --> 38:59.554

39:02.949 --> 39:04.342
LET'S GET TO WORK.

39:11.653 --> 39:14.439
THIS IS DANA DEWITT LIVE
FROM THE TOXIC SCENE

39:14.482 --> 39:16.310
THAT COULD'VE DESTROYED
GOTHAM CITY

39:16.354 --> 39:18.268
WITHOUT THE HEROICS
OF BATWOMAN.

39:18.312 --> 39:21.794
THE CITY HAS ADVISED CITIZENS
TO STAY AWAY FROM THE AREA

39:21.837 --> 39:24.536
AS THEY ASSESS THE HAZARDOUS
AIR QUALITY CAUSED

39:24.579 --> 39:29.367
BY THE JOKER'S ACID BOMB
THAT BLANKETED THE NEIGHBOR--

39:29.410 --> 39:31.499
OH, MY GOD. WHAT IS THAT?

39:33.022 --> 39:35.590
AAH! OH, MY GOD!

40:17.327 --> 40:19.025
GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD!
