WEBVTT

00:06.397 --> 00:08.138
All right, everybody, look.

00:08.182 --> 00:09.531
My mama's gonna be here soon.

00:09.574 --> 00:10.445
Feet down.

00:12.795 --> 00:14.623
Dave, you know how you usually

00:14.666 --> 00:17.060
go on and on
about how great I am?

00:17.104 --> 00:18.322
I know,
I'll turn it down.

00:18.366 --> 00:20.020
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:20.063 --> 00:21.021
I need you to turn it
all the way up.

00:22.848 --> 00:24.807
Sometimes she forgets the light

00:24.850 --> 00:26.461
I bring into the world.

00:26.504 --> 00:28.463
I'm gonna need the full Dave.

00:28.506 --> 00:29.942
Okay, full Dave.

00:29.986 --> 00:31.466
Locked and loaded.

00:33.511 --> 00:35.818
Calvin, she's coming
to see her baby boy

00:35.861 --> 00:37.211
get the Chamber
of Commerce Award.

00:37.254 --> 00:39.604
Mama Marilyn's leaving
a luxury cruise

00:39.648 --> 00:41.563
with Calvin's brother
just to be here.

00:41.606 --> 00:43.217
Now, that is a proud mother.

00:43.260 --> 00:45.393
Oh, where was my proud mother

00:45.436 --> 00:47.134
when I got my award
in fifth grade?

00:47.177 --> 00:50.267
It was for perfect attendance,
Marty.

00:50.311 --> 00:51.790
And you didn't attend.

00:53.401 --> 00:56.099
You don't see the irony in that?

00:56.143 --> 00:59.320
Look, I just want this
visit to go perfectly.

00:59.363 --> 01:02.932
Sometimes my mom can be
a little hard to please.

01:02.975 --> 01:05.717
A little?
Mama Marilyn is a gangster.

01:05.761 --> 01:07.241
She's the only one
who can crack on Pop

01:07.284 --> 01:08.285
without him cracking back.

01:08.329 --> 01:10.722
Well, it's called respect.

01:10.766 --> 01:12.246
And a little fear.

01:12.289 --> 01:14.074
I grew up in the '70s.

01:14.117 --> 01:16.032
Whuppin' kids was
still in style.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.468
Yeah, that's it.
It's true.

01:17.512 --> 01:18.600
Ooh, she's here, y'all.

01:18.643 --> 01:19.601
Ooh, I got
flowers for her!

01:19.644 --> 01:21.168
Okay, baby.

01:23.213 --> 01:25.650
Hi.Oh, my God!

01:29.176 --> 01:32.396
Ooh, girl, you look
beautiful as ever.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.224
Thank you.Hey, my grandbabies.

01:34.268 --> 01:36.270
You see me!I see you.

01:36.313 --> 01:38.576
With faces like these,

01:38.620 --> 01:40.535
why don't I have tons
of beautiful great-grandbabies?

01:42.276 --> 01:44.191
Well, Marilyn, I'd settle
for just one ugly one.

01:46.584 --> 01:48.673
You must be Dave and Gemma.

01:48.717 --> 01:50.197
Hi! Oh!

01:50.240 --> 01:52.286
I feel so warm
and safe.

01:54.984 --> 01:56.159
Hey, Mama.

01:56.203 --> 01:57.682
Oh, there you are.

01:57.726 --> 01:59.554
Yeah, yeah.

01:59.597 --> 02:01.077
You're looking good,
baby.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.034
But you got to start
exfoliating.

02:02.078 --> 02:03.732
Yeah.

02:03.775 --> 02:05.821
Oh, no, uh, right.

02:05.864 --> 02:07.301
Uh, Mama Marilyn?

02:07.344 --> 02:09.520
No need to exfoliate
perfection.

02:09.564 --> 02:11.261
I mean,
do you see those pores?

02:11.305 --> 02:12.958
No, you don't,
because they don't exist.

02:13.002 --> 02:14.917
Dave, come on.

02:14.960 --> 02:16.658
Y-You're embarrassing me.

02:16.701 --> 02:18.703
Come on.

02:26.233 --> 02:29.149
Mmm, girl, if I had a cookbook,

02:29.192 --> 02:30.454
I'd put your recipes in it.

02:32.195 --> 02:34.284
I understand
why your business is booming.

02:34.328 --> 02:36.547
Aw, thank you, Marilyn.Yeah.

02:36.591 --> 02:38.288
Well, you know, Calvin's
auto shop is doing great, too.

02:38.332 --> 02:39.811
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:39.855 --> 02:40.986
But I can't eat a car.

02:43.946 --> 02:45.817
You know, Mom, uh,

02:45.861 --> 02:48.168
the city is literally
giving me an award

02:48.211 --> 02:50.344
for how my business
serves the community.

02:50.387 --> 02:52.128
I think I'm doing all right.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.435
Lighten up, Calvin.

02:54.478 --> 02:56.176
Everything does not
have to be about you.

02:57.786 --> 03:00.528
Well, you know,
tonight kind of is.

03:00.571 --> 03:03.052
Well, you know,
Calvin getting an award

03:03.095 --> 03:05.141
is pretty impressive,
don't you think, Marilyn?

03:05.185 --> 03:08.188
It was 30 years ago
when I got it.

03:09.972 --> 03:11.539
They weren't just
handing them out

03:11.582 --> 03:13.018
to anybody
back in the day.

03:13.062 --> 03:14.281
Mm.

03:14.324 --> 03:16.239
And they still aren't.

03:18.285 --> 03:21.723
How cool is it that Calvin is
following in your footsteps?

03:21.766 --> 03:23.594
Yeah, yeah.

03:23.638 --> 03:25.335
You know, actually,
I was just thinking

03:25.379 --> 03:27.424
it should be called
"the Butler Award."

03:27.468 --> 03:29.252
Oh, that's good,
that's good.

03:29.296 --> 03:32.168
They should call it
"the Marilyn Butler Award."

03:32.212 --> 03:34.431
Because I got it first.

03:35.824 --> 03:37.434
Well, mine's gonna be
shinier than yours

03:37.478 --> 03:40.002
because it's new.

03:40.045 --> 03:41.221
What-what's that, Calvin?

03:41.264 --> 03:42.874
Uh, I was just, I was saying

03:42.918 --> 03:43.919
that I like your new hairdo.

03:43.962 --> 03:45.181
Oh.

03:48.489 --> 03:51.013
That's either
potato chip grease or glue.

03:51.970 --> 03:54.016
Only one way to find out.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.888
Oh.

03:56.932 --> 03:58.020
Peanut butter.

04:00.022 --> 04:01.806
That's nasty.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.245
This is why I always get
my own bowl of chips.

04:08.944 --> 04:11.990
Hey, so what's this history
collage you guys are working on?

04:12.034 --> 04:14.776
We're learning about
the Elaine Massacre in Arkansas.

04:14.819 --> 04:17.039
Hmm, I never learned
about that in school.

04:17.082 --> 04:20.042
Hundreds of Black people
were killed in a riot in 1919.

04:20.085 --> 04:23.263
The book says that state
officials tried to cover it up.

04:23.306 --> 04:25.134
Oh, this is a part
of the new

04:25.177 --> 04:27.049
diverse studies program
that your mom started, huh?

04:27.092 --> 04:28.485
Yeah, Mom doesn't want us
growing up

04:28.529 --> 04:29.965
as clueless as you guys did.

04:30.008 --> 04:32.228
Well...

04:32.272 --> 04:33.577
I don't want to be clueless,

04:33.621 --> 04:35.449
so I'm gonna learn
with you guys.

04:35.492 --> 04:37.320
My dad says
there's lots of people

04:37.364 --> 04:39.148
who'd rather act like
those things never happened.

04:39.191 --> 04:42.020
Well, unfortunately,
he's not wrong.

04:42.064 --> 04:44.022
Boys, set your alarm.

04:44.066 --> 04:45.415
It's time for me to get woke.

04:49.724 --> 04:51.421
I'm sorry,
he learned it from TikTok.

04:51.465 --> 04:52.683
There's nothing
I can do.

04:56.905 --> 05:00.256
And where would
Calvin's Pit Stop be

05:00.300 --> 05:02.737
without my Tina?

05:02.780 --> 05:05.522
She's the engine of my life

05:05.566 --> 05:08.699
with the performance chassis
that is built

05:08.743 --> 05:10.614
to hug my road.

05:12.703 --> 05:15.663
Ooh, that's fire, baby!

05:15.706 --> 05:16.707
Hold up.

05:18.579 --> 05:20.711
You're not really gonna
use that tonight, are you?

05:20.755 --> 05:23.888
Not anymore. No.

05:23.932 --> 05:26.891
Uh, so what time does
this little thing start tonight?

05:26.935 --> 05:30.068
Uh, well, this "little thing"
starts at00.

05:30.112 --> 05:31.809
Aren't you gonna get ready?

05:31.853 --> 05:34.116
Yeah, yeah, I'm just working
on my acceptance speech.

05:34.159 --> 05:36.292
How hard is it just to say,

05:36.336 --> 05:38.294
"Thank you, God,
thank you, Mama,"

05:38.338 --> 05:40.340
and get the hell off the stage?

05:42.385 --> 05:44.082
Um...

05:44.126 --> 05:45.475
Marilyn...

05:45.519 --> 05:47.869
I am supposed
to introduce Calvin tonight,

05:47.912 --> 05:49.871
but since you're here,

05:49.914 --> 05:52.003
why don't you say
some nice words

05:52.047 --> 05:53.918
about him in my place?

05:53.962 --> 05:56.356
Oh, Tina, that's a
wonderful idea. Thank you.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.009
Uh, Mama, you sure you can

05:58.053 --> 05:59.707
put together a speech
at the last minute?

05:59.750 --> 06:02.013
Last minute is when
I do my best work.

06:07.845 --> 06:09.499
Oh, babe.

06:09.543 --> 06:11.501
Um, I probably should've

06:11.545 --> 06:13.329
run that by you first.
I'm sorry.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.939
No, you know what, don't be.

06:14.983 --> 06:17.333
Thank you.
Mm.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.815
Now my mama will be forced
to brag about me in public.

06:20.858 --> 06:22.773
You know?

06:22.817 --> 06:24.384
I wonder what she's
gonna talk about first.

06:24.427 --> 06:26.690
You know, my business savvy,

06:26.734 --> 06:29.301
or how the community loves me?

06:29.345 --> 06:31.434
Or... oh, oh!

06:31.478 --> 06:32.740
Or how humble I am.

06:39.268 --> 06:40.922
Stop fighting me, Double Stuf!

06:42.576 --> 06:43.751
Excuse me,
Mrs. Johnson?

06:43.794 --> 06:45.013
Yep.

06:45.056 --> 06:47.842
Stan Simmons, Eden's dad.

06:47.885 --> 06:50.410
They said I'd find you
by the vending machine.

06:50.453 --> 06:52.063
That's sad.

06:52.107 --> 06:53.848
Um...

06:53.891 --> 06:55.415
How can I help you?

06:55.458 --> 06:58.635
I just want to say I'm,
uh, really struggling

06:58.679 --> 06:59.941
with this new
diversity curriculum.

06:59.984 --> 07:00.985
"Struggling"?

07:01.029 --> 07:02.944
Well, not me. More Eden.

07:02.987 --> 07:04.728
I mean, there's educating,

07:04.772 --> 07:06.426
and then there's burdening
our children with guilt,

07:06.469 --> 07:09.429
which can lead to depression
and God knows what else.

07:11.256 --> 07:13.041
Well, we certainly
don't want any of that.

07:13.084 --> 07:14.825
Mm-hmm.

07:14.869 --> 07:16.174
But the goal is
to tell the truth

07:16.218 --> 07:17.741
about our country's history.

07:17.785 --> 07:20.527
But by being exposed
to this curriculum,

07:20.570 --> 07:22.442
she's feeling responsible
for things

07:22.485 --> 07:24.269
she had nothing to do with.

07:24.313 --> 07:26.794
Like race riots and slavery.

07:26.837 --> 07:28.839
Well, our children
didn't fight the British,

07:28.883 --> 07:31.059
but we teach them about
the American Revolution.

07:34.671 --> 07:35.977
I just think it's
important for our kids

07:36.020 --> 07:37.631
to get the full picture.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.592
I was hoping to avoid this,
Mrs. Johnson, but, um...

07:42.636 --> 07:45.116
I donate a lot of money
to this school,

07:45.160 --> 07:48.598
and I'd hate to take it
and my child elsewhere.

07:50.687 --> 07:53.211
I think the old textbook
gave the right picture.

08:00.088 --> 08:01.742
If you donate so much money,

08:01.785 --> 08:03.570
why don't we have
better vending machines?

08:11.491 --> 08:13.667
Wow, Pop, it is crazy

08:13.710 --> 08:16.539
how this night is supposed
to be about you,

08:16.583 --> 08:18.672
but, uh, everybody is
loving on Mama Marilyn.

08:21.065 --> 08:22.110
Well, that's
all right.

08:22.153 --> 08:23.720
Because in a minute,

08:23.764 --> 08:26.462
she's about to give me
all my props.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.551
Now sit down and eat
your little sea bass.

08:28.595 --> 08:31.467
Fun fact.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.513
Marty, this is
the quiet part of the dinner.

08:41.912 --> 08:43.348
Uh, you okay?

08:45.263 --> 08:47.527
I'm fine. Why do you ask?

08:47.570 --> 08:49.180
Well, you're...

08:49.224 --> 08:50.704
double-fisting rosés.

08:52.183 --> 08:53.533
They're small.

08:56.927 --> 08:59.843
I just can't stop thinking about
that big donor from school.

08:59.887 --> 09:02.672
I've gotten more calls
about the new book.

09:02.716 --> 09:05.414
If we lose donations over this,
I could lose my job.

09:05.457 --> 09:07.068
Well, I think
you need to let

09:07.111 --> 09:09.070
all the parents
voice their opinions.

09:09.113 --> 09:11.115
I mean, if you're gonna
go down, go down fighting.

09:12.987 --> 09:14.728
You know what,
you're right.

09:16.033 --> 09:17.687
I'll call a meeting
and explain how important

09:17.731 --> 09:19.689
this new curriculum is.Yeah.

09:19.733 --> 09:21.778
Thanks, honey.

09:23.301 --> 09:26.130
Two more rosés, please.

09:26.174 --> 09:27.741
Relax, one's for you.

09:31.266 --> 09:33.094
Okay, all right,
everybody, here we go.

09:33.137 --> 09:34.051
Forks down, cameras up.

09:34.095 --> 09:35.749
Get your camera.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.707
Welcome, everybody.

09:37.751 --> 09:39.448
Here to introduce this year's

09:39.491 --> 09:41.624
Excellence in Business
award winner

09:41.668 --> 09:44.105
is a recipient herself
for her employment agency,

09:44.148 --> 09:46.803
and my first crush.

09:49.066 --> 09:50.328
Mrs. Marilyn Butler.

09:56.857 --> 09:59.599
Uh, uh, Tina, get me a napkin.

09:59.642 --> 10:00.774
This-this is about to get deep,
I'm sure.

10:01.775 --> 10:03.037
Okay.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.735
Thank you, everyone.

10:05.779 --> 10:07.607
What can I say
about my son, Calvin...

10:09.391 --> 10:11.959
...that he hasn't already
told you about himself?

10:14.135 --> 10:17.007
Okay, ev-everybody starts
their speech off with a joke.

10:17.051 --> 10:19.270
Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, no.

10:19.314 --> 10:21.838
That was a pretty good one.

10:21.882 --> 10:25.450
I always knew Calvin
would be his own boss.

10:25.494 --> 10:26.800
He had to be.

10:26.843 --> 10:27.975
No one else would hire him.

10:31.326 --> 10:33.633
Calvin, your mom is killing it.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.941
All my laughs are fake,
by the way.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.641
I'm so sorry, baby.

10:41.684 --> 10:44.078
Asking her to do
the intro was a mistake.

10:44.121 --> 10:46.863
No, Marty's outfit is a mistake.

10:49.126 --> 10:51.172
This is a disaster.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.792
Wow.

11:02.836 --> 11:05.882
Seriously, since there were
so many people tonight

11:05.926 --> 11:08.755
who thanked me for helping them
start their businesses,

11:08.798 --> 11:10.495
I think I should get
this award again.

11:13.890 --> 11:15.675
We love you, Marilyn!

11:15.718 --> 11:17.764
Sit on down, Frank.
Stop flirting.

11:19.287 --> 11:21.202
But, seriously,

11:21.245 --> 11:24.945
this award is
a great honor for my son.

11:24.988 --> 11:27.817
I'm sure he's gonna cherish
it like it's his first one.

11:27.861 --> 11:29.427
Because it is.

11:29.471 --> 11:32.300
Oh!

11:32.343 --> 11:34.606
This has got to be
almost over, right?

11:34.650 --> 11:36.130
If there's a God.

11:37.740 --> 11:40.830
I can go on and on about Calvin,

11:40.874 --> 11:44.138
but why do that
when he's so much better at it?

11:47.054 --> 11:48.925
Ladies and gentlemen,

11:48.969 --> 11:50.884
this year's honoree

11:50.927 --> 11:53.364
and his own biggest fan,

11:53.408 --> 11:56.063
my son, Calvin Butler.

11:57.238 --> 11:59.762
Go, Daddy!

11:59.806 --> 12:02.460
Oh, she thinks she got jokes?
I got jokes.

12:02.504 --> 12:04.245
Ca-Calvin, don't do it.
She's your mother.

12:04.288 --> 12:05.681
You'll regret it.
Just stick to your speech.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.770
Baby, you'll be fine.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.946
All right, go ahead, baby!
That's my husband!Go, Dad! Go!

12:11.556 --> 12:13.254
You want me to stay
up here with you?

12:13.297 --> 12:14.864
Make sure
they keep laughing?

12:14.908 --> 12:17.519
No, Mama,
I got it. Uh, Frank?

12:17.562 --> 12:19.173
Would you mind? Thank you.Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.

12:19.216 --> 12:21.262
Yeah, please,
go with Frank, Mama.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.528
Thank you. And, uh...

12:26.571 --> 12:28.443
thank you, Mama,
for those kind words.

12:34.014 --> 12:36.538
If it wasn't
for your endless positivity,

12:36.581 --> 12:38.148
who knows
where I would be today?

12:44.024 --> 12:46.417
I mean, it's that kind
of motherly love

12:46.461 --> 12:48.898
and support that keeps me going.

12:52.554 --> 12:53.903
Is he making fun of me?

12:53.947 --> 12:55.905
Oh, the tiramisu
is delicious.

12:55.949 --> 12:57.733
Did you have some?

13:02.042 --> 13:04.566
And again,

13:04.609 --> 13:06.568
I just want to say thank you
to my wonderful mother,

13:06.611 --> 13:09.179
my beautiful wife,
my two sons,

13:09.223 --> 13:11.181
and the Chamber of Commerce

13:11.225 --> 13:12.792
for this great award.

13:12.835 --> 13:14.184
Thank you guys so much.

13:18.493 --> 13:20.669
So that's how you get
your laughs, huh?

13:20.712 --> 13:22.584
Making fun of your mama?

13:24.368 --> 13:25.805
I just read
from my speech.

13:27.632 --> 13:30.026
Just be happy
you can't read my mind.

13:35.249 --> 13:36.554
Ooh.

13:36.598 --> 13:38.643
Calvin, I've got to say...

13:38.687 --> 13:39.949
I'm kind of afraid
of your mom.

13:43.126 --> 13:45.563
Well, I'm a grown-ass man, Dave,
and I'm not.

13:45.607 --> 13:47.478
Oh, I think she's
coming back.

13:47.522 --> 13:49.002
Okay, okay...

13:55.530 --> 13:57.619
And that's why I stand
behind my decision.

13:57.662 --> 14:00.143
This book is not teaching
an alternate history.

14:00.187 --> 14:02.624
It's teaching
the history of America.

14:06.758 --> 14:09.022
The floor is open for comments.

14:09.065 --> 14:11.851
You did great, hon.
I'm really proud of you.

14:11.894 --> 14:14.462
Me, too. You know, I like
watching you take on the masses.

14:14.505 --> 14:17.769
And by "masses,"
I mean "ignorant asses."

14:19.206 --> 14:22.383
Stan Simmons, Eden's dad.

14:22.426 --> 14:25.473
The world's already
a scary place.

14:25.516 --> 14:27.649
We don't need
our children's innocent minds

14:27.692 --> 14:29.433
filled with stuff
they don't need to know about

14:29.477 --> 14:30.913
by so-called educators.

14:30.957 --> 14:33.220
Let our kids...

14:33.263 --> 14:35.004
be kids.

14:40.009 --> 14:42.446
Did he just say
"so-called"?

14:42.490 --> 14:44.884
Yes, he did.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.842
Hold my earrings.
This might get ugly.

14:46.886 --> 14:47.974
Mm-hmm.

14:48.017 --> 14:50.019
Here, hold my earrings, too.

14:50.063 --> 14:51.891
I'm her ride-or-die.

14:53.675 --> 14:55.242
Can we say something?

14:55.285 --> 14:56.852
Grover?

14:56.896 --> 14:58.506
What are you kids doing here?

14:58.549 --> 15:00.682
We came to say
we don't want the old book.

15:00.725 --> 15:02.336
We like the new one.

15:02.379 --> 15:03.859
We want to learn the truth
about our history.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.600
Yeah, we're not scared.

15:05.643 --> 15:06.731
We can handle anything.

15:06.775 --> 15:07.907
We eat the lunch here.

15:10.387 --> 15:12.041
We are the youth...

15:12.085 --> 15:13.956
And we want the truth!

15:16.698 --> 15:18.352
Sorry, Dad, I'm
not uncomfortable.

15:18.395 --> 15:19.919
You are.
These things happened.

15:19.962 --> 15:20.920
I need to know
about it.

15:22.791 --> 15:26.403
You kids are
too young for all of this.

15:26.447 --> 15:28.710
I disagree.

15:28.753 --> 15:31.582
If my son's old enough
to experience racism,

15:31.626 --> 15:33.280
then your daughter is
old enough to learn about it.

15:36.718 --> 15:39.373
Y-You're making a big mistake.

15:39.416 --> 15:40.635
And it's gonna cost you.

15:40.678 --> 15:42.506
Mr. Simmons,

15:42.550 --> 15:44.378
I know in my heart
if we don't tell

15:44.421 --> 15:48.077
the whole story,
that will be the mistake.

15:48.121 --> 15:49.905
But if parents like you
are gonna threaten

15:49.949 --> 15:51.559
to pull your donations
over this,

15:51.602 --> 15:54.170
then this isn't
the place for me.

15:54.214 --> 15:56.956
No, Ms. Johnson,
we love what you're doing.

15:56.999 --> 15:58.740
I'd be happy
to donate more money

15:58.783 --> 16:00.568
so our kids can learn
their true history.

16:00.611 --> 16:03.266
Us, too.Oh, count me in.

16:03.310 --> 16:05.529
And my kids don't even
go to this school.

16:13.189 --> 16:16.845
Thanks again
for your hospitality, Tina.

16:16.888 --> 16:20.066
And thanks for the ride
to the airport, boys.

16:20.109 --> 16:22.720
Somebody else was too busy.

16:25.071 --> 16:27.856
Well, I don't remember
somebody asking me.

16:30.250 --> 16:32.339
Well, I'm sorry you had
to cut your trip short.

16:32.382 --> 16:34.950
Ouch, man. It's already
uncomfortable enough.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.387
I don't need you
poking me.

16:37.431 --> 16:39.215
Mama Marilyn,
are you sure

16:39.259 --> 16:40.825
you can't stay for
another day or two?

16:40.869 --> 16:42.566
Uh, thank you, Malcolm,

16:42.610 --> 16:45.395
but I know when
I'm not wanted.

16:45.439 --> 16:47.441
Again...

16:47.484 --> 16:50.705
just reading
from my prepared speech.

16:50.748 --> 16:52.924
Mm-hmm.

16:52.968 --> 16:55.710
Disrespected by my own son.

16:55.753 --> 16:58.843
"Disrespected"?

16:58.887 --> 17:00.845
Me disrespecting you?

17:00.889 --> 17:02.412
Oh!

17:02.456 --> 17:05.415
Wow!

17:05.459 --> 17:07.461
That is rich.

17:07.504 --> 17:10.551
Boy, are you coming for me?

17:10.594 --> 17:12.161
No, Mama,
this my house right here.

17:12.205 --> 17:14.250
I need you to understand this...Oh! Oh! Oh!

17:14.294 --> 17:16.470
Oh! Okay, oh, oh, wait,
okay, all right!

17:16.513 --> 17:18.559
It is time

17:18.602 --> 17:22.041
that you both acknowledge
that you are just alike.

17:22.084 --> 17:24.652
Spicy and lovable
all wrapped up into one.

17:24.695 --> 17:27.046
Which is why I love you both.

17:27.089 --> 17:30.005
But nobody is leaving my house
until you talk things out.

17:31.528 --> 17:33.400
That's right, I said it.

17:37.708 --> 17:39.493
Well, I guess
Tina told you.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.627
I thought
she was telling you.

17:47.675 --> 17:51.679
Ma, I just wanted this visit
to be different this time.

17:51.722 --> 17:53.420
I mean, I was proud
of that award,

17:53.463 --> 17:55.030
and I wanted
you to be, too.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.946
Calvin,
I am proud of you.

17:57.989 --> 18:00.166
Well, it doesn't
feel like it.

18:00.209 --> 18:02.298
In fact, it's never
felt like it.

18:02.342 --> 18:05.127
My whole life, I've
been second with you.

18:05.171 --> 18:07.434
I mean, and I'm
your firstborn.

18:07.477 --> 18:09.218
Curtis...

18:09.262 --> 18:11.090
he gets all
the attention.

18:11.133 --> 18:13.048
And I got all
the wisecracks.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.137
You didn't need
my attention.

18:15.181 --> 18:17.966
Like Tina said,
we're just alike.

18:18.009 --> 18:21.100
Good-looking,
intelligent,

18:21.143 --> 18:23.319
independent
and thick-skinned.

18:25.060 --> 18:27.715
You see what you did?
What?

18:27.758 --> 18:29.760
You were talking
about me, but really,

18:29.804 --> 18:31.632
it was a compliment
about you.

18:33.155 --> 18:34.896
Oh, that's where
I get that from.

18:37.551 --> 18:41.337
Son, you were the kind
of kid that if I said

18:41.381 --> 18:43.557
there was something
impossible for you to do,

18:43.600 --> 18:46.125
you would get up
the next day and just do it.

18:47.474 --> 18:49.258
Well, why did I
get a whupping

18:49.302 --> 18:51.260
when you said it was
impossible for me

18:51.304 --> 18:53.132
to drive your car?

18:53.175 --> 18:55.351
Baby, you were
only 12 years old.

18:57.701 --> 18:59.225
I mean, it was a small car,
you remember that?

18:59.268 --> 19:00.748
It was a little bitty car.

19:00.791 --> 19:02.097
Yeah, I remember.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.230
Look, you were
a shooting star then.

19:04.273 --> 19:06.275
You're a shooting star now.

19:06.319 --> 19:08.930
Well, that would've
been a nice line

19:08.973 --> 19:10.975
for your speech
last night.

19:11.019 --> 19:12.716
But where's
the fun in that?

19:15.589 --> 19:18.548
Calvin, I love
the man you've become.

19:18.592 --> 19:21.812
Despite the fact that you was
gonna kick my ass out.

19:23.379 --> 19:25.903
No, you were the one
that wanted to leave.

19:25.947 --> 19:27.688
Well, now I'll stay

19:27.731 --> 19:29.994
a few extra days.

19:30.038 --> 19:31.605
And you can
make it up to me.

19:33.389 --> 19:35.609
My baby.
Thanks, Mama.

19:35.652 --> 19:37.263
Thank you, honey.

19:37.306 --> 19:38.786
So, uh...

19:38.829 --> 19:41.571
how many extra
days we talking?

19:43.138 --> 19:44.313
I'm playing, I'm playing.

19:49.579 --> 19:52.191
You know, it's been a while
since I've stretched out

19:52.234 --> 19:54.323
the old karaoke
cords, but...

19:54.367 --> 19:56.499
Mama Marilyn, you
are in for a treat.

19:56.543 --> 19:58.545
Oh, no, baby.

19:58.588 --> 19:59.763
We're gonna save you
for last.

20:03.419 --> 20:05.116
Okay, baby, start us off.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.988
Baby, you know I'm tired.

20:32.231 --> 20:35.277
Say what

20:43.633 --> 20:46.245
Come on, y'all!

20:46.288 --> 20:48.421
So you still want
to follow this?

20:48.464 --> 20:49.900
Nope.
