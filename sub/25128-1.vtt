00:13.635 --> 00:16.385
(dramatic music)

00:22.375 --> 00:25.042
(classic music)

00:37.260 --> 00:39.427
(ticking)

00:41.428 --> 00:43.554
- [Man] I went to the
movies the other day,

00:43.555 --> 00:46.431
I noticed a trend starting to emerge.

00:46.432 --> 00:48.288
The yuppie fear thriller.

00:48.289 --> 00:50.348
Now I don't know what a yuppie is,

00:50.349 --> 00:51.949
we certainly weren't all as good looking

00:51.973 --> 00:54.795
as James Spader or Rob Lowe.

00:54.796 --> 00:57.259
These certainly aren't the
movies I can relate to.

00:57.260 --> 00:58.580
Do you ever notice in these films

00:58.604 --> 01:02.343
how everybody's so well tanned,
well toned and well groomed?

01:02.344 --> 01:05.303
This one stars Matthew
Modine and Melanie Griffith.

01:05.304 --> 01:07.611
It also has a sociopathic in it played

01:07.612 --> 01:11.063
by Michel Keaton, I hope I
didn't ruin that for you.

01:11.064 --> 01:14.456
Here's another example of
yuppie culture, shoulder pads.

01:14.457 --> 01:15.737
Now when I when I was growing up

01:15.761 --> 01:17.624
the only time anyone wore shoulder pads

01:17.625 --> 01:19.910
was in the national football league.

01:19.911 --> 01:22.023
I guess it's supposed to be fashionable.

01:22.024 --> 01:24.623
What exactly is a yuppie anyway?

01:24.624 --> 01:26.511
I'm told it's an acronym,

01:26.512 --> 01:29.981
it stands for young, urban, professional.

01:29.982 --> 01:31.415
Of course when I was young I wasn't

01:31.416 --> 01:34.809
concerned with being a
young urban professional.

01:34.810 --> 01:36.474
I was more concerned with surviving

01:36.475 --> 01:39.625
the mortar rounds coming from
a German gun in placement.

01:39.626 --> 01:42.138
American youth of today are to busy

01:42.139 --> 01:45.794
worrying about the color of their new BMW.

01:45.795 --> 01:48.704
When I was a kid I had
to stand in bread lines,

01:48.705 --> 01:52.142
you know we had simpler
problems when I was growing up.

01:52.143 --> 01:53.652
Like if the Russians were gonna

01:53.653 --> 01:56.948
be rolling tanks down
Welsher Boulevard or not,

01:56.949 --> 01:58.529
course when I was in my early 20s

01:58.530 --> 02:01.625
my ambition was to
dodge stuka dive bombers

02:01.626 --> 02:04.783
that the Germans were
laying on us at D day,

02:04.784 --> 02:07.263
I wasn't concerned about new technology

02:07.264 --> 02:10.264
like fanny packs or word processors.

02:11.338 --> 02:13.442
No my concerns were more about whether

02:13.443 --> 02:14.908
or not my buddies were hanging

02:14.909 --> 02:18.217
dead from barbed wire on Omaha beach.

02:18.218 --> 02:21.173
I was to busy jumping into
my fox hole to avoid getting

02:21.174 --> 02:25.256
my head blown off by a german
machine gun in placement.

02:25.257 --> 02:27.058
While these yuppies today walk around with

02:27.059 --> 02:31.469
their fanny packs I was carrying
home my buddy in a bucket.

02:31.470 --> 02:33.602
Of course we didn't have fanny packs back

02:33.603 --> 02:35.356
then otherwise we'd need very big

02:35.357 --> 02:37.906
ones to carry around our buddies.

02:37.907 --> 02:40.677
They call them body bags in the military.

02:40.678 --> 02:43.625
Instead of fanny packs
and other new technologies

02:43.626 --> 02:47.225
like word processors and fax machines

02:47.226 --> 02:49.883
my main concern was on Omaha beach

02:49.884 --> 02:52.008
and the human soup that
we were being ground

02:52.009 --> 02:55.016
up into by the german artillery.

02:55.017 --> 02:56.692
- I'm Morley Safer we'll.

02:56.693 --> 02:58.859
(ringing)

02:58.860 --> 02:59.860
- Hello?

03:01.560 --> 03:02.753
- [Phone] Trent.

03:02.754 --> 03:03.931
- General Schwartzcoff.

03:03.932 --> 03:05.445

03:05.446 --> 03:07.798

03:08.743 --> 03:09.893
- Yes sir.

03:09.894 --> 03:11.573
- [Phone] I need you to do something.

03:11.574 --> 03:13.424
- Of course I'll do something sir.

03:13.425 --> 03:16.164
- [Phone] Someone is hired to kill you.

03:16.165 --> 03:17.918
Somebody you know Trent.

03:17.919 --> 03:18.919
- Oh really?

03:19.889 --> 03:21.682
- [Phone] You understand?

03:21.683 --> 03:23.143
- Yes sir.

03:23.144 --> 03:26.816
- [Phone] It's your goddamn partner Tim.

03:26.817 --> 03:29.131
He wants you dead.

03:29.132 --> 03:30.743
- He wants me dead.

03:30.744 --> 03:32.661
- [Phone] Listen to me.

03:36.630 --> 03:38.047
You know Willard.

03:40.553 --> 03:44.357
He hired Bono from U2 to
do the dirty work Trent.

03:44.358 --> 03:45.299
- Bono?

03:45.300 --> 03:47.882
- [Phone] Can you believe that?

03:52.379 --> 03:55.393
- I'll take care of it immediately.

03:55.394 --> 03:56.683
- [Girl] If something happens to

03:56.684 --> 03:59.805
my mommy will you take care of me?

03:59.806 --> 04:02.042
- Of course I would.

04:02.043 --> 04:03.448
- [Man] And their destruction.

04:03.449 --> 04:05.136
- There's only one woman for me.

04:05.137 --> 04:07.103
- That's all you need.

04:07.104 --> 04:08.590
- [Man] Her triumph.

04:08.591 --> 04:12.583
- When your husband makes
love to you it's my face he's.

04:12.584 --> 04:15.325
- Just get out of our house.

04:15.326 --> 04:17.569
- She's turning me Micheal
just like you said she would.

04:17.570 --> 04:18.528
- [Woman] Call the police.

04:18.528 --> 04:19.363
- [Man] Clare calm down.

04:19.363 --> 04:21.600
- [Woman] You don't know
what she's capable of.

04:21.601 --> 04:24.684
- [Man] People don't deserve freedom.

04:25.625 --> 04:27.358
- Anyone can have an exploit.

04:27.359 --> 04:28.192
(smacks)

04:28.193 --> 04:29.373
- [Woman] Micheal?

04:29.374 --> 04:31.241
- [Woman] What goes around comes around.

04:31.242 --> 04:33.319
- [Girl] Mommy.

04:33.320 --> 04:34.153

04:34.154 --> 04:37.298
the cradle is the hand
that rules the world.

04:37.299 --> 04:39.725
- [Woman] It's my family.

04:39.726 --> 04:42.758
- [Man] The hand that rocks the cradle.

04:42.759 --> 04:45.451
- They don't deserve free enterprise.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.548
This is our time my friend.

04:47.549 --> 04:50.264

04:50.265 --> 04:51.098

04:51.099 --> 04:52.481

04:52.482 --> 04:53.461
- Dan.

04:53.462 --> 04:55.294

04:56.430 --> 04:59.347

05:00.407 --> 05:02.856
I just saw a preview for this movie.

05:02.857 --> 05:04.663
The hand that rocks the cradle.

05:04.664 --> 05:07.621
- [Dan] Yeah I'm looking forward to that.

05:07.622 --> 05:09.475
- [Trent] I saw myself in the preview.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.106
- [Dan] What?

05:11.107 --> 05:13.135
- No it was me.

05:13.136 --> 05:17.034
It was my life, it was my
wife, it was my family.

05:17.035 --> 05:19.157
- [Dan] That doesn't make any sense.

05:19.158 --> 05:19.991
- [Trent] I know it doesn't

05:19.992 --> 05:22.110
make any sense but that what I saw.

05:22.111 --> 05:23.151

05:49.861 --> 05:51.876

05:51.877 --> 05:54.794
There is a hand rocking the cradle.

05:55.760 --> 05:57.696
It's rocking my cradle.

06:32.524 --> 06:34.227
- Trent will you take that jacket off?

06:34.228 --> 06:35.228
- Meh.

06:38.001 --> 06:39.321
- You know in all the years we've

06:39.345 --> 06:42.127
been married I've never once
seen you without that thing on.

06:42.128 --> 06:44.641

25:04.016 --> 25:05.364
It's called sampling.

25:05.365 --> 25:07.689
We're sampling the past into the present.

25:07.690 --> 25:09.490
You're gonna be hearing

Solid chrome makes up the receiver,

the effective range is 600 miles solider.

head, I can't do it anymore.

30:01.631 --> 30:03.214

30:03.215 --> 30:06.104
- Julia Roberts from Pretty Women is here.

30:06.105 --> 30:07.197

30:07.198 --> 30:08.998
I don't know what to do,
he's going to beat me

30:09.022 --> 30:10.749
to a pulp and he's going to kill me

30:10.750 --> 30:12.868
and drown me in a pool of my own blood.

30:12.869 --> 30:14.842
- Christ I'm gonna kill that son of a.

30:14.843 --> 30:16.363
- For all I know he's just gonna watch

30:16.387 --> 30:19.008
the pools of blood for
days, he's just a bastard.

30:19.009 --> 30:21.089
- Alright, alright, take it
easy okay, we're here to help.

30:21.090 --> 30:23.304
You can stay with us for a
while, what ever you need.

30:23.305 --> 30:24.745
Look you live right next door,

we can just go over when he's not there,

30:26.347 --> 30:28.387
get your things and bring
them back here, it's okay.

30:28.411 --> 30:29.647
- No, I, I was.

30:29.648 --> 30:30.481
- [Tessa] Since when did men think

30:30.482 --> 30:32.367
they could start treating us this way?

30:32.368 --> 30:33.201
- [Trent] I don't think we need

30:33.202 --> 30:34.642
to turn this into a sexist argument.

30:34.666 --> 30:35.644
- [Julia] I was!

30:35.645 --> 30:37.290
- You know in the 80s we had

30:37.291 --> 30:40.038
the really successful slasher films,

30:40.039 --> 30:42.821
you know it was like the
last gasp of male dominance

30:42.822 --> 30:45.127
and really did well
for us in the industry,

30:45.128 --> 30:47.313
I'm not saying that
women don't have a place

30:47.314 --> 30:49.458
but I just think that if we just went back

30:49.459 --> 30:52.648
to that a little bit we would
have a great market for it,

30:52.649 --> 30:53.743
you know the market even shows

30:53.744 --> 30:55.278
that the creeps are still out there.

30:55.279 --> 30:56.959
- Alright, could you knock it off Jacques!

30:56.983 --> 30:57.798
Don't listen to him.

30:57.799 --> 30:59.055
- [Jacques] You always cut me off on

30:59.056 --> 31:00.095
this and I'm telling you.

31:00.096 --> 31:01.027
- This is not funny.

31:01.027 --> 31:01.910
- [Jacques] You know your problem,

31:01.911 --> 31:03.530
you never got creeped out enough,

31:03.531 --> 31:05.867
that was always the issue,
if you got creeped on more.

31:05.868 --> 31:06.756
- I was!

31:06.757 --> 31:08.637
- I think it would have
blown out better for ya,

31:08.661 --> 31:10.021
look I'm just trying to say

31:10.022 --> 31:12.191
that there was a time when men had a place

31:12.192 --> 31:13.432
in this industry and women have

31:13.456 --> 31:15.328
just kinda swooped in and taken over.

31:15.329 --> 31:16.849
- [Trent] Well they haven't completely

31:16.873 --> 31:18.985
taken over the show yet, come on.

31:18.986 --> 31:21.026
- Look I am working for
women at this point ya know,

31:21.050 --> 31:23.321
I mean I got Dawn Steels got my balls

31:23.322 --> 31:25.526

31:25.527 --> 31:27.007
I mean I'm taking it up the ass here!

31:27.031 --> 31:29.339
- [Tessa] Are you kidding
me, knock it off already.

31:29.340 --> 31:30.173
- I was.

31:30.174 --> 31:32.789
- Everyone, why are you
bringing this up now?

31:32.790 --> 31:34.957
(yelling)

31:37.796 --> 31:39.288
Jacques will you knock it off?

31:39.289 --> 31:41.360
- I was sleeping with the enemy!

31:41.361 --> 31:44.406
(dramatic music)

31:44.407 --> 31:46.899
- Trent come here, this is my wife Naomi,

31:46.900 --> 31:48.317
Naomi this is Trent.

31:48.318 --> 31:52.204
She's the creator and CEO of Chia pet.

31:52.205 --> 31:54.233

Bad things happen to good people

32:15.370 --> 32:19.117

reason what so ever Trent.

32:19.118 --> 32:20.404
We can take care of this.

32:20.405 --> 32:22.458

out of my house, okay.

32:22.459 --> 32:23.326
He gives me the creeps.

32:23.327 --> 32:26.156
- [Man] I know, but what
about the babysitter?

32:26.157 --> 32:28.655

calm, hand her some clothes,

32:28.656 --> 32:31.181
just a pair of something.

32:31.182 --> 32:34.871
- I cannot believe you
have this in your home,

32:34.872 --> 32:36.404
is this a real Dego?

32:36.405 --> 32:37.238
- Yes.

32:37.239 --> 32:39.329

32:39.330 --> 32:41.103

32:48.186 --> 32:49.431

excuses anymore, he's a coked up,

32:51.867 --> 32:54.104
he's just unreliable, he's unstable.

32:54.105 --> 32:55.265
- [Man] Don't worry about it.

32:55.266 --> 32:56.590
- [Trent] The guy is unreliable

32:56.591 --> 32:58.503
and I can't have him in
the operation anymore,

32:58.504 --> 32:59.664
you've got to get rid of Tim.

32:59.688 --> 33:01.521

33:09.480 --> 33:11.323

33:11.324 --> 33:12.157

are me and my Leslie.

33:13.919 --> 33:14.835

- Door to silence, bringer of violence.

36:20.212 --> 36:24.333
- [All] Give us the rune
stone, give us the moon stone.

36:24.334 --> 36:27.484
Servants of twilight fires within,

36:27.485 --> 36:29.902
immortal sins, next of kin's.

36:30.847 --> 36:34.989
Evil destruction, children of the night.

36:34.990 --> 36:36.902

36:36.903 --> 36:38.346
Give us this night.

36:38.347 --> 36:40.958

36:40.959 --> 36:42.626
- Give us the sight.

36:43.792 --> 36:46.459
(ominous music)

36:56.753 --> 36:58.365
- Nobody else has seen this right?

36:58.366 --> 37:01.654
What, it was just playing last night?

37:01.655 --> 37:02.613
- That idiot Tobo must

37:02.614 --> 37:04.879
have left this thing playing all night.

37:04.880 --> 37:09.325
- Yeah well we cannot
let these things be seen.

37:09.326 --> 37:11.253
If the tribunal finds out,
you know what will happen.

37:11.254 --> 37:13.219
- [Trent] I know, I know,
don't worry about it okay?

37:13.220 --> 37:14.700
Moron didn't know what he was seeing,

37:14.701 --> 37:16.141
he probably thinks this is out takes

37:16.165 --> 37:18.324
from a slayer video or something.

37:18.325 --> 37:20.493
While she's not real at all.

37:20.494 --> 37:21.848
She comes from glass bricks.

37:21.849 --> 37:23.716
- [Robert] Explain, I don't get it.

37:23.717 --> 37:25.527
- She's an artificial construct,

37:25.528 --> 37:27.345
she comes from glass bricks.

37:27.346 --> 37:28.412
- [Man] That's the babysitter.

37:28.413 --> 37:29.246
- [Trent] What the fuck?

37:29.246 --> 37:30.079
- [Robert] You're right.

37:30.079 --> 37:30.912
- [Trent] Well yes.

37:30.913 --> 37:32.879
- I knew there was something
about her, I knew it.

37:32.880 --> 37:34.633
We're gonna close that deal, tonight.

37:34.634 --> 37:36.871
- Good, the wall is sealed.

37:36.872 --> 37:38.215
- Is it solidified?

37:38.216 --> 37:40.755
- Yup, it's rock solid.

37:40.756 --> 37:43.756
We did it, we changed the time line.

37:46.158 --> 37:48.410
We just reshaped reality.

37:48.411 --> 37:50.661

37:57.782 --> 37:59.075
- How ya doing?

37:59.076 --> 38:01.180
I'm officer Chooford.

38:01.181 --> 38:03.152
This is special officer Chasuhaga.

38:03.153 --> 38:05.113
Do you mind if we come in
and have a word with ya?

38:05.137 --> 38:05.830
- Chewford?

38:05.831 --> 38:08.452
- Chugo, I mean Chooford, Chooford,

38:08.453 --> 38:10.928
my dad gave me the
nickname when I was a kid.

38:10.929 --> 38:13.035
It stuck, anyway, do
you mind if we come in?

38:13.036 --> 38:15.721
- Not at all, we whole heartedly
support law enforcement.

38:15.722 --> 38:19.270
In fact I write most of the
policies you gentlemen follow.

38:21.967 --> 38:24.475

38:24.476 --> 38:25.689
Three strike law.

38:25.690 --> 38:29.147
- Yeah, trying to get it
down to a one strike law.

38:29.148 --> 38:31.898
Or maybe half a strike, fuck 'em.

38:33.541 --> 38:35.541
- Life for a thumb here?

38:36.463 --> 38:39.161
- Let's make it a misdemeanor.

38:39.162 --> 38:40.154
- Seems a bit harsh.

38:40.155 --> 38:41.689
- [Chasuhaga] Yeah, that's ridiculous.

38:41.690 --> 38:43.998
- And who is this again?

38:43.999 --> 38:46.133
- She's special officer Chasuhaga.

38:46.134 --> 38:48.600
She's part of a new
investigative division.

38:48.601 --> 38:50.121
- What investigative division is that?

38:50.145 --> 38:52.548
I over see all the divisions.

38:52.549 --> 38:53.937
- Not this on.

38:53.938 --> 38:56.021
(coughs)

38:58.115 --> 38:59.469
- Is that who I think it is?

38:59.470 --> 39:01.689
- [Trent] Yeah, that's Julia Roberts

39:01.690 --> 39:03.331
she's staying with us for a while.

39:03.332 --> 39:04.876
- Julia fucking Roberts?

39:04.877 --> 39:06.685
(chuckles)

39:06.686 --> 39:07.772

Pretty fucking woman.

I love her, you know just my wife

39:11.146 --> 39:12.304
and I just the other night we went

39:12.305 --> 39:13.719

39:13.720 --> 39:14.570
- [Trent] Yeah well she was sleeping

39:14.571 --> 39:16.927
with the enemy and that's
why she's here now.

39:16.928 --> 39:19.059
- Julia fucking Roberts
lives on your couch?

39:19.060 --> 39:20.523
- It's incredible, I thought she

39:20.524 --> 39:23.873
had a movie to do but sh
will not get off my couch.

39:23.874 --> 39:25.157
We had one unwanted roommate,

39:25.158 --> 39:26.529
now we can't get rid of this one.

39:26.530 --> 39:27.832
- Is it a pull off couch?

39:27.833 --> 39:29.614
- No it's a stay on couch,

39:29.615 --> 39:31.220
people get in that couch
and they don't wanna leave.

39:31.221 --> 39:32.781
- Well did ya try walking around naked,

39:32.805 --> 39:34.436
maybe that'll um, get her out of here.

39:34.437 --> 39:36.889
- We've tried everything,
she does not wanna leave.

39:36.890 --> 39:37.998
No, Julia Roberts is very

39:37.999 --> 39:39.602
comfortable where she is apparently.

39:39.603 --> 39:41.100
- Well she looks hot, sitting there.

39:41.101 --> 39:41.934
- [Trent] Yeah, well maybe she

39:41.935 --> 39:43.086
can go to live on your
couch for six months.

39:43.087 --> 39:44.773
- Well she's welcome, my wife
wouldn't like her very much.

39:44.774 --> 39:46.905
- Do you know anything
about pretty young women

39:46.906 --> 39:49.263
wandering around in
the early morning hours

39:49.264 --> 39:53.140
wrapped in plastic and
tin foil on your street?

39:53.141 --> 39:55.786
- Can't say that I do.

39:55.787 --> 39:58.988
- Tell you what, reports we're getting.

39:58.989 --> 40:01.284
These girls are being shot
with a tranquilizer gun

40:01.285 --> 40:05.110

out in front of your house.

40:05.111 --> 40:06.799
Walking around your street.

40:06.800 --> 40:08.680
And you're telling me you
know nothing about it?

40:08.681 --> 40:10.001
- I don't know anything about it.

40:10.025 --> 40:12.078
- They're seen coming from your house.

40:12.079 --> 40:13.331
- No idea.

40:13.332 --> 40:14.165
- You sure?

40:14.166 --> 40:15.748
- Oh yeah I'm sure.

40:16.776 --> 40:20.014
- You know that your other
neighbor is Bill Cosby?

40:20.015 --> 40:21.015
- So?

40:24.210 --> 40:25.410

40:25.434 --> 40:27.015
for a while and we're gonna blow

You and bill do a little hug
and drug on your off time.

01:02:50.608 --> 01:02:52.519
- Why the odd number, why not 28?

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:53.997

No you know why, you know
why that's out there?

01:03:43.124 --> 01:03:45.851
Cause if you decide to kill me.

01:03:45.852 --> 01:03:48.708

01:04:03.322 --> 01:04:04.955
product in the consumers hands Trent.

01:04:04.956 --> 01:04:06.785
Once that's gone it's just profit for us.

01:04:06.786 --> 01:04:07.619
For everyone.

01:04:07.619 --> 01:04:08.452

01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:19.941
to take things home that they can buy?

01:04:19.965 --> 01:04:22.644
Forget it, people are
morons, we'll remove options.

01:04:22.645 --> 01:04:23.764
Fuck everyone.

01:04:23.765 --> 01:04:25.183
- The music industry is over

01:04:25.184 --> 01:04:27.098
and more importantly I need to be

01:04:27.099 --> 01:04:28.787
in charge of the entire thing.

01:04:28.788 --> 01:04:30.622

- How did you come up with such a thing?

01:04:34.981 --> 01:04:37.695
- We're shutting down the
entire music retail industry.

01:04:37.696 --> 01:04:39.181
In both America and the world.

01:04:39.182 --> 01:04:40.015
- Right.

01:04:40.016 --> 01:04:42.274
- [Brent] You know how much
it costs to manufacture CDs?

01:04:42.275 --> 01:04:43.127
- [Trent] I do not.

01:04:43.128 --> 01:04:48.108
- Ten cents, cassettes, five
cents, the hesta Ann front.

01:04:48.109 --> 01:04:48.942
- [Trent] I see your point.

01:04:48.943 --> 01:04:50.503
- [Brent] We're shutting them all down,

01:04:50.527 --> 01:04:54.255
the public are morons, we
control the world now Trent.

01:04:54.256 --> 01:04:56.662
We have to do Russia of
799 before it's to late,

01:04:56.663 --> 01:04:59.796
we're shutting it down
Trent the world is ours.

01:04:59.797 --> 01:05:01.421
(chuckles)

01:05:01.422 --> 01:05:05.111
- I don't think that guys
capable of shutting his garage.

01:05:05.112 --> 01:05:06.558
The world is ours?

01:05:06.559 --> 01:05:08.566
No, no, the world is mine.

01:05:08.567 --> 01:05:10.510
The fucks he got?

01:05:10.511 --> 01:05:12.554
Taking my business model from cineplex

01:05:12.555 --> 01:05:16.383
odeon and transposing it to Tower Records.

01:05:16.384 --> 01:05:18.134
This will never work.

01:05:20.467 --> 01:05:23.050
(somber music)

01:05:30.291 --> 01:05:31.291
- [Trent] Gene Spader?

01:05:31.292 --> 01:05:33.012
- [Chad] Fucking bad
influence that asshole.

01:05:33.036 --> 01:05:35.286
- [Trent] Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

01:05:37.092 --> 01:05:38.134
- I mean that's the other thing,

01:05:38.135 --> 01:05:40.533
I'm just under so much stress
with Janet and everything.

01:05:40.534 --> 01:05:42.233
She's been over eating
her weights going up

01:05:42.234 --> 01:05:44.578
and down like a goddamn Wall street stock.

01:05:44.579 --> 01:05:45.617
- [Trent] What does she weigh now anyway?

01:05:45.618 --> 01:05:47.027
- [Chad] She's up to 275.

01:05:47.028 --> 01:05:47.861
- [Trent] Jesus.

01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:48.694
- [Chad] Spending thousands on

01:05:48.695 --> 01:05:50.193
this new fucking jazzercise thing

01:05:50.194 --> 01:05:52.078
and I don't know if it's working or not.

01:05:52.079 --> 01:05:54.039
And I mean so it's, you
know a breath of fresh air

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:55.550
when you come up here because you're

01:05:55.551 --> 01:05:58.276
one of my only friends, actually
maybe my dearest friend.

01:05:58.277 --> 01:06:00.637
- [Trent] You know I'm more
concerned with Latoya right now.

01:06:00.661 --> 01:06:02.285
Do you know she's talking?

01:06:02.286 --> 01:06:04.449
- Let me tell you something Trent,

01:06:04.450 --> 01:06:07.681
Laytoya's toying around a little to much.

01:06:07.682 --> 01:06:08.892
- She's wild.

01:06:08.893 --> 01:06:10.536
She's out of control, how she learned

01:06:10.537 --> 01:06:11.697
this stuff in the first place

01:06:11.721 --> 01:06:14.040
I'll never understand why she was let in,

01:06:14.041 --> 01:06:16.805
this is Latoya Jackson
we're talking about here.

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:20.905
- You know Janet is driving
me crazy, I can't control her.

01:06:20.906 --> 01:06:24.753
She sits around the house
all day eating Hagen daz.

01:06:24.754 --> 01:06:28.434
- What has she done for you lately?

01:06:28.435 --> 01:06:29.845
- You know that I'm the person

01:06:29.846 --> 01:06:33.429
that wrote the lyrics
for the song Control?

01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:35.260
- That's very impressive.
- And you know where

01:06:35.261 --> 01:06:36.539
those lyrics came from?

01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:38.253
- Perimeter scan clear.

01:06:38.254 --> 01:06:40.721
- [Chad] They came from you Trent.

01:06:40.722 --> 01:06:42.943
From what I've learned about you.

01:06:42.944 --> 01:06:44.872
From how you've made me feel.

01:06:44.873 --> 01:06:49.770
We can sit here and we can
talk all fucking day long.

01:06:49.771 --> 01:06:51.913
But it's how you've made me feel,

01:06:51.914 --> 01:06:54.879
that's what inspired the
lyrics behind Control.

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:57.541
- So should I be expecting
a check any day now?

01:06:57.542 --> 01:06:59.606
Sick of people ripping me off.

01:06:59.607 --> 01:07:01.415
First Spader, now you.

01:07:01.416 --> 01:07:03.096
- Let's go inside and
make some sandwiches.

01:07:03.097 --> 01:07:04.150
- Alright, let's go.

01:07:04.151 --> 01:07:06.567
(dramatic music)

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:14.515
- I want this guy dead.

01:07:14.516 --> 01:07:16.918
- [Bono] Don't worry about
it I'll take care of it.

01:07:16.919 --> 01:07:19.252
(crunching)

01:07:20.619 --> 01:07:22.690
- Look, I gotta rehears
with the band alright?

01:07:22.691 --> 01:07:24.941
Edge is flying in tomorrow.

01:07:26.536 --> 01:07:30.204
- [Robert] What am I paying you for again?

01:07:30.205 --> 01:07:34.701
Listen to me, U2 would
be nothing without me.

01:07:34.702 --> 01:07:37.403
U2 would be nothing without me.

01:07:37.404 --> 01:07:39.489
- [Bono] Do you mean me,
you to or the band U2?

01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:42.653
- [Robert] Jesus fucking Christ.

01:07:42.654 --> 01:07:47.482
- [Bono] Look Achtung Baby
is on tour right now baby.

01:07:47.483 --> 01:07:50.203
I'll have Chango take care of it.

01:07:50.204 --> 01:07:52.666
- I don't know what Chango is,

01:07:52.667 --> 01:07:55.649
just get the fuck done with it.

01:07:55.650 --> 01:07:56.688

rapper just attacked me

his ass, I took care of it.

tonight, what am I gonna do?

01:13:29.012 --> 01:13:29.930

01:13:29.930 --> 01:13:30.765

scotch and a shot of tequila?

01:13:36.728 --> 01:13:38.040
- Have you met Trent?

01:13:38.041 --> 01:13:42.055
Trent's here, he's a
really good friend of mine.

01:13:42.056 --> 01:13:44.639
This is my wife, Janet Jackson.

01:13:46.230 --> 01:13:47.874
- [Trent] Janet Jackson?

01:13:47.875 --> 01:13:48.708
- How are you?

01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:50.590
- Wow it is really nice to meet you.

01:13:50.591 --> 01:13:51.424
- Thank you.

01:13:51.425 --> 01:13:53.859
- What Have You Done For
Me Lately, love that.

01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:57.336
So how's this no fear campaign
of yours coming along?

01:13:57.337 --> 01:13:58.755
Or is that a brand?

01:13:58.756 --> 01:14:02.426
Just what the hell are you
trying to put together here?

01:14:02.427 --> 01:14:04.261
- I mean it's a nice little racket

01:14:04.262 --> 01:14:09.055
but I mean I'm still making
more money with water beds.

01:14:09.056 --> 01:14:12.148
- Bubbles gonna pop on that real soon.

01:14:12.149 --> 01:14:13.316
- That's cute.

01:14:14.491 --> 01:14:16.251
He's just a friend of
mine, he means nothing,

01:14:16.275 --> 01:14:18.170
he's little confused,
he's a little scared.

01:14:18.171 --> 01:14:21.702
Just play the quagmire
and let me do this okay?

01:14:21.703 --> 01:14:24.681
- [Janet] But I'm just, don't trust him.

01:14:24.682 --> 01:14:27.650
- You just need to walk
around and look cute okay?

01:14:27.651 --> 01:14:29.711
- You played ball with
the Mendez brothers?

01:14:29.712 --> 01:14:32.454
Didn't those guys kill their parents?

01:14:32.455 --> 01:14:36.955
- Trent this is America,
innocent until proven guilty.

01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:41.001
- You always know just
how to calm me down.

01:14:41.002 --> 01:14:43.561
- Yeah, ya see you just need to put

01:14:43.562 --> 01:14:46.479
your mind in a different dimension.

01:14:47.787 --> 01:14:50.500
You know what the
problem with the mind is?

01:14:50.501 --> 01:14:52.216
You don't own it.

01:14:52.217 --> 01:14:54.658
It's not yours for the taking my brother.

01:14:54.659 --> 01:14:55.632
Okay?

01:14:55.633 --> 01:14:57.247
Just sit back and relax,

01:14:57.248 --> 01:14:59.381
don't let your emotions
get the best of you.

01:14:59.382 --> 01:15:01.873
You just roll with the waves.

01:15:01.874 --> 01:15:04.541
Dan's acquired right of Docking.

01:15:06.778 --> 01:15:09.177
- These raw bands are gonna be famous.

01:15:09.178 --> 01:15:12.035
Pay to play on the Sunset strip?

01:15:12.036 --> 01:15:13.286
I created that.

01:15:14.444 --> 01:15:17.177
The idea is to get Cindy
Loper to actually wear

01:15:17.178 --> 01:15:20.443
a fanny pack for the photo shoot

01:15:20.444 --> 01:15:21.758
for the next album coming out.

01:15:21.759 --> 01:15:25.318
- She's so unusual she's
probably gonna go for it.

01:15:25.319 --> 01:15:26.999
- [Chad] And if you know it's gonna branch

01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:28.656
off to people like Peewee Herman.

01:15:28.657 --> 01:15:30.462
Spoke with Eddie Van Halen a well.

01:15:30.463 --> 01:15:32.856

01:15:32.857 --> 01:15:34.257

the creative aspect there's an amazing

01:16:01.654 --> 01:16:04.678
music producer who goes
by the name of Jimmy Jam.

01:16:04.679 --> 01:16:07.201
He showed out of Minnesota.

01:16:07.202 --> 01:16:09.307

01:16:09.308 --> 01:16:14.221

01:16:18.610 --> 01:16:21.488

01:16:21.489 --> 01:16:22.977
He's driving me fucking crazy,

01:16:22.978 --> 01:16:25.429
he's been staying with
us for over four years.

01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:28.180
This disgusting idiot Tobo, okay?

01:16:29.042 --> 01:16:31.757

01:16:31.758 --> 01:16:33.953

01:16:33.954 --> 01:16:38.454

You know how much trouble I could get in?

01:16:41.339 --> 01:16:43.756
- Trent take it easy brother.

01:16:45.377 --> 01:16:47.257
You know it's just like
I was telling my friend.

01:16:47.281 --> 01:16:50.684
Christian Brando, you
can't control any of it.

01:16:50.685 --> 01:16:52.996

01:16:55.417 --> 01:16:58.550

01:16:58.551 --> 01:17:00.302
- Oh I know, it's ours.

01:17:00.303 --> 01:17:02.343
- We're going into the 90s hell.

01:17:02.344 --> 01:17:06.017
Trent just sit back and relax brother,

01:17:06.018 --> 01:17:07.935
you're with Caruso now.

01:17:09.397 --> 01:17:10.517

01:17:10.541 --> 01:17:13.599
for you to always remember Trent

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:15.201
is the we own this time brother.

01:17:15.202 --> 01:17:16.677
- Oh I know.

01:17:16.678 --> 01:17:17.905
But I love hearing it.

01:17:17.906 --> 01:17:20.682
- But try thinking about not thinking

01:17:20.683 --> 01:17:23.074
and try controlling what you can't

01:17:23.075 --> 01:17:24.971
control which is absolutely nothing.

01:17:24.972 --> 01:17:27.555
- Chad, it's all about control.

01:17:28.708 --> 01:17:30.430
How do you think I got where I am today?

01:17:30.431 --> 01:17:33.790
How do you think that I have
all of the judges in my pocket?

01:17:33.791 --> 01:17:37.296
How do you think I'm the
one writing the laws?

01:17:37.297 --> 01:17:39.514
It's all about taking control.

01:17:39.515 --> 01:17:43.932
- Trent you have nothing to
fear, but no fear itself.

01:17:47.586 --> 01:17:50.378
- That's where the no
fear things came from.

01:17:50.379 --> 01:17:53.129
(dramatic music)

01:17:56.890 --> 01:17:58.661
- Friday is the spice of life.

01:17:58.662 --> 01:18:00.342
- We all like the
different things in guys.

01:18:00.366 --> 01:18:03.151
- One persons turn offs might
be another persons turn on.

01:18:03.152 --> 01:18:05.221
- The one thing we share
in common is Telefriends.

01:18:05.222 --> 01:18:08.853
- [TV] Where I always
meet the greatest guys.

01:18:08.854 --> 01:18:10.616
- [TV] Call now.

01:18:10.617 --> 01:18:12.087
- That was a lovely meal Trent,

01:18:12.088 --> 01:18:15.031
thank you and your lovely
wife Tessa very much,

01:18:15.032 --> 01:18:17.260
thank this lovely ladies as well,

01:18:17.261 --> 01:18:18.461
it's been a wonderful evening.

01:18:18.485 --> 01:18:19.418
- Aw thank you.

01:18:19.419 --> 01:18:21.891
- You Know what, these kind of gatherings

01:18:21.892 --> 01:18:24.596
remind me of some of the great Japanese

01:18:24.597 --> 01:18:27.163
films that maybe you're familiar with.

01:18:27.164 --> 01:18:31.132
You know the Japanese were
the masters of the frame,

01:18:31.133 --> 01:18:33.914
they were the masters of composition,

01:18:33.915 --> 01:18:38.462
and years later I was
approached to the Exorcist.

01:18:38.463 --> 01:18:40.851
And that was a film that was very much

01:18:40.852 --> 01:18:43.609
a part of the zaikaist at the time.

01:18:43.610 --> 01:18:45.423
But things have changed now

01:18:45.424 --> 01:18:49.610
and they want me to do
this yuppie fear thriller

01:18:49.611 --> 01:18:51.901
type film that's, you know you're probably

01:18:51.902 --> 01:18:56.490
more in tune with it that I
am, it's part of the Zaikaist.

01:18:56.491 --> 01:19:00.429
The studio isn't always right,
the suits are usually wrong.

01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:02.691
- No, no, no, the studio's always right.

01:19:02.692 --> 01:19:04.349
(laughing)

01:19:04.350 --> 01:19:05.994
- Trent I know what your saying

01:19:05.995 --> 01:19:08.959
about the era of the maverick film maker

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:12.324
being at an end but I think you're wrong.

01:19:12.325 --> 01:19:15.135
I think if even if you
take into consideration

01:19:15.136 --> 01:19:18.991
the restrictions and some of the efforts

01:19:18.992 --> 01:19:22.617
that are being made to
corral some of these,

01:19:22.618 --> 01:19:25.670
these maverick film makers,
I think there's still

01:19:25.671 --> 01:19:27.218
a few that are going to distinguish

01:19:27.219 --> 01:19:29.233
themselves in the years ahead.

01:19:29.234 --> 01:19:32.736
For instance speaking for
myself I just finished.

01:19:32.737 --> 01:19:36.347
Cat Squad two and there was
very little intemperance

01:19:36.348 --> 01:19:38.807
from the suits, I was able to do what

01:19:38.808 --> 01:19:41.642
I wanted to do the way I wanted to do it.

01:19:41.643 --> 01:19:43.243
- Well William with all due respect with

01:19:43.244 --> 01:19:44.844
the budget that you were working with no

01:19:44.868 --> 01:19:49.318
one was going to interfere,
but when you wanna think big.

01:19:49.319 --> 01:19:52.259
At that point maybe it's best to let

01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:55.283
some other people take
control of the situation.

01:19:55.284 --> 01:19:56.524
Sit down with Steven Spielberg,

01:19:56.548 --> 01:19:59.646
ask him who's making the decisions.

01:19:59.647 --> 01:20:01.703
- It sounds to me Trent like your on board

01:20:01.704 --> 01:20:04.202
for all kinds of artistic suppression,

01:20:04.203 --> 01:20:05.555
if you don't mind me saying that.

01:20:05.556 --> 01:20:08.105
- Oh no, no, we're not suppressing it,

01:20:08.106 --> 01:20:11.035
we're bringing it to the forefront.

01:20:11.036 --> 01:20:14.036
(suspenseful music)

01:20:21.188 --> 01:20:23.168
- When I started working in this industry

01:20:23.169 --> 01:20:26.651
I was working completely
from a five cents level,

01:20:26.652 --> 01:20:28.697
just completely locked in.

01:20:28.698 --> 01:20:30.036
And by the time I'm finished

01:20:30.037 --> 01:20:31.813
my latest film The Guardian

01:20:31.814 --> 01:20:35.897
I was fully on board with
beings living in trees.

01:20:38.079 --> 01:20:41.618
- [Trent] As long as
we keep people stupid.

01:20:41.619 --> 01:20:42.899
- Well the goal of this film

01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:45.692
is to wake people up,
it's just the opposite.

01:20:45.693 --> 01:20:49.242
These films are, this
is a five alarm fire.

01:20:49.243 --> 01:20:51.008
I don't know why you would say that Trent.

01:20:51.009 --> 01:20:54.009
(suspenseful music)

01:21:01.169 --> 01:21:02.929
- The thing I like about
You William Friedkin

01:21:02.953 --> 01:21:05.799
is that you're a director
who's willing to play ball.

01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:08.183
- Well let's not get
to carried away Trent,

01:21:08.184 --> 01:21:10.234
I like the support from up top

01:21:10.235 --> 01:21:11.818
but I'm not one of these people

01:21:11.819 --> 01:21:14.155
that's ready to throw I the towel,

01:21:14.156 --> 01:21:16.305
that the age of the maverick director.

01:21:16.306 --> 01:21:19.306
(suspenseful music)

01:21:21.121 --> 01:21:24.235
And Trent I can't help but
wonder if you've completely

01:21:24.236 --> 01:21:28.653
sold your soul to this
illuminati construct of money.

01:21:30.119 --> 01:21:33.119
(suspenseful music)

01:21:43.265 --> 01:21:45.150
And you can literally walk in to

01:21:45.151 --> 01:21:48.649
some of these gay clubs and
it would be pitch black.

01:21:48.650 --> 01:21:50.388
- I remember that.

01:21:50.389 --> 01:21:51.697
- [William] You're to young.

01:21:51.698 --> 01:21:54.698
(suspenseful music)

01:21:58.487 --> 01:22:00.836
It dealt with all the things
we're dealing with now,

01:22:00.837 --> 01:22:03.527
the corporate ownership of America,

01:22:03.528 --> 01:22:05.681
the corporatization of culture.

01:22:05.682 --> 01:22:06.922
- [Woman] I can't believe that.

01:22:06.946 --> 01:22:09.120
- [William] The emerging police state.

01:22:09.121 --> 01:22:11.953
And I wrote Bill, I
said how soon can we get

01:22:11.954 --> 01:22:16.388
a script drafted and make a
fucking movie out of this?

01:22:16.389 --> 01:22:19.389
(suspenseful music)

01:22:23.647 --> 01:22:25.236
(laughing)
- [William] He introduced me

01:22:25.237 --> 01:22:28.294
to a group of producers
and all they kept talking

01:22:28.295 --> 01:22:31.212
about was the reptilian illuminati.

01:22:32.534 --> 01:22:34.148
I'd never heard of these concepts,

01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:36.308
I didn't know what the hell
they were talking about.

01:22:36.309 --> 01:22:39.574
(suspenseful music)

01:22:39.575 --> 01:22:41.870
Credit Bill Blady with
turning the envelope.

01:22:41.871 --> 01:22:43.168
- That's funny.

01:22:43.169 --> 01:22:46.499
In the mean time we're staying back here

01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:48.240
and we are shutting down all

01:22:48.241 --> 01:22:50.841
of the single house movie theaters.

01:22:50.842 --> 01:22:51.675
- Why?

01:22:51.676 --> 01:22:53.793
- Which of course you're
in agreement with.

01:22:53.794 --> 01:22:54.794
- No, why?

01:22:56.047 --> 01:22:57.592
Are you looking to kill the spirit

01:22:57.593 --> 01:23:01.883
of cinema which this entire
industry was founded upon?

01:23:01.884 --> 01:23:03.653
- [Trent] The spirit of cinema?

01:23:03.654 --> 01:23:08.000
- Trent are you in league
with this effort to destroy.

01:23:08.001 --> 01:23:08.959
- It's required.

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:12.896
- [William] The individual
auteur authorship of.

01:23:12.897 --> 01:23:14.297
- Hey, no, no, no, no, we're trying

01:23:14.298 --> 01:23:15.898
to make some money here, cineplex odeon.

01:23:15.922 --> 01:23:16.871
- [Tessa] Calm down.

01:23:16.872 --> 01:23:21.539
- It's okay, cineplex odeon,
multiplexes are the future.

01:23:24.393 --> 01:23:26.915
- [TV] Rated R, starts
tomorrow at theater everywhere.

01:23:26.916 --> 01:23:28.276
- Trent I didn't sign up for this,

01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:31.475
when I was making The
People vs Paul Crump,

01:23:31.476 --> 01:23:34.510
before you were in
diapers my good young man.

01:23:34.511 --> 01:23:35.344
- [Trent] Uh huh, uh huh.

01:23:35.345 --> 01:23:37.037
- The zaikaist of the time was

01:23:37.038 --> 01:23:39.448
that american film makers would have

01:23:39.449 --> 01:23:42.170
the opportunity to become auteurs,

01:23:42.171 --> 01:23:43.934
do you now the auteur theory?

01:23:43.935 --> 01:23:46.198
- Oh that opportunity
has passed my friend.

01:23:46.199 --> 01:23:48.821
No, no, no, the single
house movie theaters

01:23:48.822 --> 01:23:52.524
are the past, multiplexes are the future.

01:23:52.525 --> 01:23:53.525
Okay?

01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:58.009
- [Lady] Yes.

01:23:58.010 --> 01:24:02.167
- It's very simple, the more
screens, the more money.

01:24:02.168 --> 01:24:03.722
We're going to over see it all,

01:24:03.723 --> 01:24:04.711
we're going to make sure

01:24:04.712 --> 01:24:07.961
that we give the people what they want.

01:24:09.348 --> 01:24:11.752
And we're gonna get what we want,

01:24:11.753 --> 01:24:14.170
you're with me on this right?

01:24:15.511 --> 01:24:17.267
- I'm gonna have to think about it Trent.

01:24:17.268 --> 01:24:21.435
- William Friedkin, I know
you're with me on this.

01:24:25.257 --> 01:24:27.762
The 90s are gonna be a
great time my friend,

01:24:27.763 --> 01:24:29.263
just get on board.

01:24:30.832 --> 01:24:31.832
Multiplexes.

01:24:33.976 --> 01:24:34.976
- I'm in.

01:24:34.977 --> 01:24:38.013
- Hey, we're manipulating reality.

01:24:38.014 --> 01:24:38.847
- To The Guardian.

01:24:38.848 --> 01:24:41.472
- [Women] The Guardian,
the Guardian was great.

01:24:41.473 --> 01:24:43.016
- [Trent] Block buster.

01:24:43.017 --> 01:24:46.017
(suspenseful music)

01:24:48.286 --> 01:24:53.203
(chattering) (eerie music)

01:24:56.094 --> 01:24:57.761
- [Woman] Oh my God.

01:24:59.621 --> 01:25:00.621
Oh my God.

01:25:01.925 --> 01:25:03.269
- [Trent] Really guys?

01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:04.270
Now?

01:25:05.624 --> 01:25:07.217
(dramatic chord)

01:25:07.218 --> 01:25:09.718
(guns firing)

01:25:23.257 --> 01:25:24.732
(suspenseful music)

01:25:24.733 --> 01:25:28.733
- [TV] 1-900-867-3007,
three dollars per minute.

01:25:29.744 --> 01:25:34.033
Stay on as long as you'd
like, for adult only.

01:25:34.034 --> 01:25:37.058
(chocking)

01:25:37.059 --> 01:25:39.809
(dramatic music)

01:25:46.748 --> 01:25:48.998
(coughing)

01:25:51.477 --> 01:25:53.144
- Where, where am I?

01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:58.089
What's going?

01:25:58.090 --> 01:25:59.090
- The hell?

01:25:59.986 --> 01:26:03.433
- Why do I sound like this?
- (coughs)

01:26:03.434 --> 01:26:06.028
This doesn't make any sense.

01:26:06.029 --> 01:26:09.529
- Well, what a little shit, what the hell?

01:26:13.037 --> 01:26:14.620
- Where's Friedkin?

01:26:15.984 --> 01:26:17.956
Where's Billy Friedkin?

01:26:17.957 --> 01:26:19.540
Where is everybody?

01:26:21.257 --> 01:26:22.424
Why am I here.

01:26:27.588 --> 01:26:28.813
What?

01:26:28.814 --> 01:26:31.091
(dramatic chord) What is this?

01:26:31.092 --> 01:26:32.271
- Oh no.
- Man.

01:26:32.272 --> 01:26:33.632
- [Trent] This can't be happening.

01:26:33.656 --> 01:26:36.323
No! (Screaming)

01:26:37.858 --> 01:26:39.775
I, I've gotta get home.

01:26:47.573 --> 01:26:50.240
What the, what the hell are you?

01:26:54.849 --> 01:26:57.895
So what, what do you think
you're looking at, stop it.

01:26:57.896 --> 01:26:59.766
Stop it, no, no, no don't look at me,

01:26:59.767 --> 01:27:01.814
this is not the real me.

01:27:01.815 --> 01:27:04.332
Leave me alone, don't look
at me, don't look at me.

01:27:04.333 --> 01:27:05.292
- This is not, this is not me.

01:27:05.293 --> 01:27:06.604
- New Jack city.

01:27:06.605 --> 01:27:07.682
- I don't look like this.
- Everybody crowd around,

01:27:07.683 --> 01:27:09.383
- Follow us, this is where the party's at.

01:27:09.384 --> 01:27:10.925
Yeah I see you.

01:27:10.926 --> 01:27:12.126
- New Jack city?

01:27:12.127 --> 01:27:13.390
New Jack city?

01:27:13.391 --> 01:27:15.070
- [Guys] New Jack city.

01:27:15.071 --> 01:27:15.935
(booms)

01:27:15.936 --> 01:27:17.455
- Fuck me, Jack city.

01:27:17.456 --> 01:27:18.776
I'm not interested, I don't care.

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:20.133
- New Jack city.

01:27:21.731 --> 01:27:24.552
- Shut up, it must be a terrible movie.

01:27:24.553 --> 01:27:27.220
Mario Van Peebles is over rated.

01:27:28.948 --> 01:27:33.781
(coughs) (radio chatter)

01:27:39.346 --> 01:27:43.513
- Why are you so obsessed
with these glass bricks?

01:27:46.538 --> 01:27:48.371
God you're disgusting.

01:27:49.263 --> 01:27:53.477
And what's with this novel
that you took from the house?

01:27:53.478 --> 01:27:54.603
Is this some kind of mystery

01:27:54.604 --> 01:27:57.188
that your building, you
need to keep me in on this.

01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:58.606
I'm your partner.

01:28:02.626 --> 01:28:04.626
I out rank you you know?

01:28:08.222 --> 01:28:12.555
And when are you gonna clean
up this fucking pigpen?

01:28:17.687 --> 01:28:19.770
This is a fucking pigpen!

01:28:21.779 --> 01:28:24.406
This is a company car, not your house.

01:28:24.407 --> 01:28:26.556
I don't even know how you got hired.

01:28:26.557 --> 01:28:29.890
I can't believe you're a police officer.

01:28:31.678 --> 01:28:34.178
Much less a fucking detective.

01:28:36.003 --> 01:28:39.170
How the hell did you get hired anyway?

01:28:41.694 --> 01:28:43.134
- Do you remember those glass bricks

01:28:43.158 --> 01:28:45.983
in the bathroom back at the house?

01:28:45.984 --> 01:28:46.984
- Ya.

01:28:48.034 --> 01:28:52.225
- Every time I touched one
it was like touching jelly.

01:28:52.226 --> 01:28:54.582
It was fucking weird.

01:28:54.583 --> 01:28:55.868
- Huh?

01:28:55.869 --> 01:28:56.869
- Look.

01:29:00.256 --> 01:29:01.256
Let's go.

01:29:02.375 --> 01:29:03.375
- Where?

01:29:05.393 --> 01:29:09.636
- We're gonna go see detective Matsahiro.

01:29:09.637 --> 01:29:11.021
- Who?

01:29:11.022 --> 01:29:12.264
- Detective Matsahiro.

01:29:12.265 --> 01:29:14.765
(car dinging)

01:29:18.728 --> 01:29:19.892
- So where is this guy?

01:29:19.893 --> 01:29:22.430
- Hey get your gun tucked
into your bun alright?

01:29:22.431 --> 01:29:25.045
He's gonna be right
here, he's expecting us.

01:29:25.046 --> 01:29:26.507
- What is that supposed to mean?

01:29:26.508 --> 01:29:27.675
- There he is.

01:29:33.175 --> 01:29:34.580
Pleasure officer.

01:29:34.581 --> 01:29:36.996
Matsahiro, special officer Chasuhaga

01:29:36.997 --> 01:29:38.140
from the stock division.

01:29:38.141 --> 01:29:39.030
- Stockade?

01:29:39.031 --> 01:29:40.398
- Yeah he's from Tokyo, from on

01:29:40.399 --> 01:29:42.707
the black reign division, down long.

01:29:42.708 --> 01:29:44.092
- Black reign division?

01:29:44.093 --> 01:29:46.260
- Yeah like the movie, Black Reign.

01:29:46.261 --> 01:29:48.235
- Micheal Gagain.

01:29:48.236 --> 01:29:53.153
- Yeah I know the movie guys
but what the hell is going on?

01:29:56.214 --> 01:29:57.214
- She knows a little bit,

01:29:57.215 --> 01:30:01.214
she's a little confused,
why don't you tell her.

01:30:10.820 --> 01:30:11.987
Investigation.

01:30:13.926 --> 01:30:16.248
It's a very strong connection,
I've been telling ya.

01:30:16.249 --> 01:30:17.879
- No this is insane,

01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:21.392
is this some kind of practical joke Chuck?

01:30:21.393 --> 01:30:24.216
- You are named Chuck Chooford?

01:30:24.217 --> 01:30:26.816
- Yes, I gave him a
different name from before,

01:30:26.817 --> 01:30:28.317
yeah I'm Chooford.

01:30:30.388 --> 01:30:33.721
- [Chasuhaga] What the heck is going on?

01:30:37.408 --> 01:30:39.311
- When the glass brick freezes.

01:30:39.312 --> 01:30:40.145
- What?

01:30:40.146 --> 01:30:42.842
- Time freezes, I've been telling ya.

01:30:42.843 --> 01:30:47.093
- We need to find baby
shitter, how you say?

01:30:47.094 --> 01:30:47.927
- [Chooford] Sitter.

01:30:47.927 --> 01:30:48.760
- Baby what?

01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:49.593
- [Chooford] Babysitter,

01:30:49.593 --> 01:30:50.426
through Japanese, babyshitter, babysitter.

01:30:50.427 --> 01:30:52.904
- Okay, the babysitter in the house?

01:30:52.905 --> 01:30:54.322
- [Chooford] Yes.

01:30:56.405 --> 01:31:01.405
- [Chasuhaga] Alright so, time
freezes, what does that mean?

01:31:03.495 --> 01:31:05.551
What is going on guys?

01:31:05.552 --> 01:31:07.969
(chattering)

01:31:10.832 --> 01:31:13.415
- I am the foulest of them all.

01:31:15.262 --> 01:31:17.705
Hold out your palm, I'll
leave my ink stain on you.

01:31:17.706 --> 01:31:19.873
(chatter)

01:31:23.687 --> 01:31:25.854
(booming)

01:31:28.009 --> 01:31:31.426
Nobody cares, nobody's interested unless.

01:31:40.416 --> 01:31:42.583
(booming)

01:31:43.598 --> 01:31:44.781
- Who is this guy?

01:31:44.782 --> 01:31:46.314
Kim Fowley?

01:31:46.315 --> 01:31:48.929
Give me a break, that guy's all washed up,

01:31:48.930 --> 01:31:51.180
I'm bigger than Kim Fowley.

01:31:56.969 --> 01:32:00.282
No, I'll never accept it,
I'll never accept this,

01:32:00.283 --> 01:32:03.416
I killed Duke Connor, I'm within control.

01:32:03.417 --> 01:32:04.750
I bent the laws.

01:32:10.752 --> 01:32:14.458
This is terrible, noise,
this is not working.

01:32:14.459 --> 01:32:18.542
This is not the reality
that I'm gonna live with.

01:32:20.786 --> 01:32:23.036
What are you talking about?

01:32:29.286 --> 01:32:33.203
- [Man] All I want is my
fucking money forward.

01:32:34.241 --> 01:32:39.112
- That guy's lucky to sell
ten tickets to anything.

01:32:39.113 --> 01:32:40.781
I'm still Trent DuPont.

01:32:40.782 --> 01:32:43.126
- [Man] Trent, what are you doing?

01:32:43.127 --> 01:32:44.127
Turn around.

01:32:44.979 --> 01:32:45.979
Hey.

01:32:49.251 --> 01:32:52.336
You're blocking me, what the
hell can't you move outta here.

01:32:52.337 --> 01:32:55.018
Hell you dummy sons of
bitches, get out of my way.

01:32:55.019 --> 01:32:57.238
Listen to me, get out of my way.

01:32:57.239 --> 01:32:58.072
(yelling) - [Trent] I'm still.

01:32:58.073 --> 01:33:00.009
Trent DuPont, I'm still I'm control.

01:33:00.010 --> 01:33:01.976
You can stay there, writes
the laws, my reality!

01:33:01.977 --> 01:33:03.337
Changing, I'm changing my reality,

01:33:03.361 --> 01:33:04.997
multiplexes are the future.

01:33:04.998 --> 01:33:05.998
- Ivory?

01:33:07.618 --> 01:33:08.629
- Ivory ya.

01:33:08.630 --> 01:33:10.079
- Where, what are you doing?

01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:12.112
- I'm in Palm Springs right now.

01:33:12.113 --> 01:33:13.344
- Where's my driver?

01:33:13.345 --> 01:33:15.959
Your car was supposed to
be here 30 minutes ago.

01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:18.044
- Well ya'll gotta figure
it out for yourselves.

01:33:18.045 --> 01:33:20.088
- I don't know what's
going on in Westwood,

01:33:20.089 --> 01:33:22.109
there was a shooting,
the blacks were there

01:33:22.110 --> 01:33:23.519
and there was a screening

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:25.826
of a black film and someone got shot,

01:33:25.827 --> 01:33:27.132
(booms) It's complete mayhem

01:33:27.133 --> 01:33:28.685
there across the street right now.

01:33:28.686 --> 01:33:30.612
- I ain't got nothing
to do with that shit.

01:33:30.613 --> 01:33:34.103
- That's the thing, with Trent
it's becoming a disaster.

01:33:34.104 --> 01:33:36.701
When I get back from Paris,
if that's not taken care of

01:33:36.702 --> 01:33:39.811
you and I are gonna have
some serious problems.

01:33:39.812 --> 01:33:41.644
It's getting sloppy Ivory.

01:33:41.645 --> 01:33:43.391
It's getting really sloppy.

01:33:43.392 --> 01:33:45.670
- Hey man, Trent started this whole thing,

01:33:45.671 --> 01:33:47.322
I do what Trent says.

01:33:47.323 --> 01:33:50.561
- Whatever Trent tells you is a lie.

01:33:50.562 --> 01:33:53.860
As a matter of fact I already
got Trent taken care of.

01:33:53.861 --> 01:33:55.504
I mean for Christs sakes the guys

01:33:55.505 --> 01:33:58.830
not even an american,
he's a fucking Canadian.

01:33:58.831 --> 01:34:00.660
- Man I'm in Palm Springs right now.

01:34:00.661 --> 01:34:03.004
- I don't give a damn if
you're in Palm Springs,

01:34:03.005 --> 01:34:04.378
I need a car here in ten minutes.

01:34:04.379 --> 01:34:07.084
- Hey listen man, this is the
new Jack city uprising man.

01:34:07.085 --> 01:34:07.918
- You know what's gonna happen

01:34:07.919 --> 01:34:09.911
if Janet doesn't make that flight?

01:34:09.912 --> 01:34:12.571
- Janet don't want nothing
to do with your ass no more.

01:34:12.572 --> 01:34:13.405
- You would have never even

01:34:13.406 --> 01:34:15.488
have met Axle Rose if it wasn't for me.

01:34:15.489 --> 01:34:16.406
- Actual Fowley?

01:34:16.407 --> 01:34:19.542
- Not Actual Fowley, Axle Rose.

01:34:19.543 --> 01:34:23.297
- She ain't taking no flight,
she coming with me now.

01:34:23.298 --> 01:34:24.966
- Oh, oh really?

01:34:24.967 --> 01:34:26.900
Well you listen to me you fucking cunt.

01:34:26.901 --> 01:34:28.811
If you don't start thinking rationally

01:34:28.812 --> 01:34:30.372
you're gonna end up in a fucking coffin

01:34:30.396 --> 01:34:32.976
right next to Trent, you understand that?

01:34:32.977 --> 01:34:35.812
- Did this mother fucker
just call me a cunt?

01:34:35.813 --> 01:34:38.725
- You know what, go fuck
yourself you fucking cunt.

01:34:38.726 --> 01:34:40.086
Now let's get the fuck out of here

01:34:40.110 --> 01:34:42.860
(dramatic music)

01:34:53.431 --> 01:34:54.812
Wait a second, where are we going?

01:34:54.813 --> 01:34:55.646
Let's go this way.

01:34:55.647 --> 01:34:58.396
(dramatic music)

01:35:06.286 --> 01:35:07.453
- [Man] Trent.

01:35:08.666 --> 01:35:09.666
- What?

01:35:09.667 --> 01:35:11.107
- [Man] Trent.
- What's that sound?

01:35:11.108 --> 01:35:13.543
What in the worlds talking to me?

01:35:13.544 --> 01:35:14.864
- Yo craft it's time, cause we're

01:35:14.888 --> 01:35:16.999
about to take over this baby.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:17.918
- This is our terf.

01:35:17.919 --> 01:35:20.180
(yelling)

01:35:20.181 --> 01:35:21.709
- This is our food line right here.

01:35:21.710 --> 01:35:22.704
- That's right.

01:35:22.705 --> 01:35:26.151
- Cause if you cross that line
you gonna get bum whooped.

01:35:26.152 --> 01:35:27.485
- I can't sleep.

01:35:32.756 --> 01:35:36.923
Oh no, I thought if I woke
up I'd be myself again.

01:35:37.952 --> 01:35:40.805
(dramatic music) Not this self,

01:35:40.806 --> 01:35:42.223
but my real self.

01:35:43.488 --> 01:35:45.619
- That's right man, come join the party.

01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:47.425
Come on, come join the party.

01:35:47.426 --> 01:35:48.259
- Right on.

01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:49.562
- [Boys] Come on, there's gonna

01:35:49.563 --> 01:35:51.079
be a party and we gonna boogie boy.

01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:52.056
New Jack city boy.

01:35:52.056 --> 01:35:52.889
We are gonna boogie.

01:35:52.889 --> 01:35:53.722
New Jack city boy.

01:35:53.722 --> 01:35:54.555
Do it.

01:35:54.555 --> 01:35:55.388
- [Trent] No strikes.

01:35:55.388 --> 01:35:56.221
Just stop it.

01:35:56.222 --> 01:35:58.689
(chattering)

01:35:58.690 --> 01:35:59.894
- Hey. (Dramatic music)

01:35:59.895 --> 01:36:01.094
- Who are you?

01:36:01.095 --> 01:36:02.747
- [Human] I'm Trent DuPont, move it.

01:36:02.748 --> 01:36:04.542
- But that's impossible, I'm Trent DuPont.

01:36:04.543 --> 01:36:05.376
- [Human] I don't have time for this.

01:36:05.376 --> 01:36:06.209
- No, no, no, no.

01:36:06.210 --> 01:36:07.514
- I'm a busy man.

01:36:07.515 --> 01:36:09.368
- I'm Trent DuPont.
- I'm Trent DuPont.

01:36:09.369 --> 01:36:10.358
- Oh you think you're tough

01:36:10.359 --> 01:36:11.674
just cause you're taller than me.

01:36:11.675 --> 01:36:13.415
- I don't know who you are,
I don't care who you are,

01:36:13.416 --> 01:36:14.249
- I'm Trent DuPont.
- Alright brother.

01:36:14.250 --> 01:36:17.254
- You're not Trent DuPont, I'm
Trent DuPont, I'll kill you.

01:36:17.255 --> 01:36:18.459
- I don't have time for you.

01:36:18.460 --> 01:36:21.622
(dramatic chord) (yelling)

01:36:21.623 --> 01:36:24.320
- [Trent] I'll have you
killed, you stay right there.

01:36:24.321 --> 01:36:26.469
I will get you, I will attack you,

01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:28.567
(growling)
I will, where are you going?

01:36:28.568 --> 01:36:29.401
Get back here!

01:36:29.402 --> 01:36:34.084
(yelling) (sirens)

01:36:34.085 --> 01:36:35.605
(dramatic music)
- That's how we do it,

01:36:35.629 --> 01:36:36.253
New Jack city.

01:36:36.254 --> 01:36:38.511
- [All] New Jack city, New
Jack city, New Jack city.

01:36:38.512 --> 01:36:43.345
(dramatic music) (sirens)

01:36:47.810 --> 01:36:52.727
