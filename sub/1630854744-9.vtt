00:09.510 --> 00:11.470
<i>You have me confused with someone else.</i>

00:11.470 --> 00:13.680
Sounds like someone really hurt you.

00:14.264 --> 00:16.517
<i>A secret is a weapon.</i>

00:17.100 --> 00:21.063
A knife of insight to be used by you

00:22.689 --> 00:23.982
<i>or against you.</i>

00:24.525 --> 00:30.364
<i>But using a weapon not only changes
the victim, but the one who wields it.</i>

00:32.115 --> 00:37.538
One thing we know is that former mayoral
candidate Andrew Finney was killed.

00:37.538 --> 00:40.707
All right, listen up!
Finney is the priority.

00:40.707 --> 00:44.878
<i>To believe his colleagues,
Finney was a champion for Oakland,</i>

00:44.878 --> 00:46.588
<i>but he had a dark secret.</i>

00:46.588 --> 00:48.674
He was a sex trafficker.

00:49.675 --> 00:53.929
<i>We know he made payments
to law enforcement to hide his crimes,</i>

00:54.972 --> 00:56.598
<i>but someone was blackmailing him</i>

00:56.598 --> 01:00.811
<i>and clearly wanted to harm him
when they realized he might talk.</i>

01:01.436 --> 01:07.860
<i>Often those closest to you are
the custodians of your deepest secrets.</i>

01:08.986 --> 01:14.908
<i>The fear is, one day after they've
quietly slipped out the back door,</i>

01:14.908 --> 01:19.496
they'll weaponize
those precious truths against you.

01:20.622 --> 01:27.045
<i>What I wanna know is, what other secrets
did Finney take with him to his grave?</i>

01:27.629 --> 01:30.632
<i>Whatever they are and who killed him...</i>

01:34.469 --> 01:39.558
hold the key to stopping
whoever is behind this trafficking ring,

01:40.142 --> 01:42.436
once and for all.

02:54.383 --> 02:58.846
I am going to chalk this lapse
in judgment up to you drinking again.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.180
Hello?

03:01.390 --> 03:04.893
I'm sorry, baby.
What were you saying again?

03:04.893 --> 03:06.311
What is going on with you?

03:06.311 --> 03:08.355
You've been like a zombie
for, like, two days.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.274
It's just stress.
I haven't been sleeping well.

03:10.274 --> 03:14.278
Well, perk up, drink your caffeine,
whatever you gotta do. Today's a big day.

03:14.278 --> 03:15.445
Yes, it is.

03:15.445 --> 03:16.655
- Morning, honey!
- Hi.

03:16.655 --> 03:18.198
You ready for school?

03:18.699 --> 03:19.783
Yeah, I think so.

03:19.783 --> 03:20.909
All right.

03:21.577 --> 03:23.287
I'm so proud of you.

03:23.287 --> 03:25.330
I think getting back to normal
is gonna be good for you.

03:25.330 --> 03:26.957
It's gonna be good for us as a family.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.168
First, let's go over the rules
one more time

03:29.168 --> 03:30.586
so we're all on the same page.

03:30.586 --> 03:32.796
Text check-ins every hour.

03:32.796 --> 03:34.256
Location tracking on.

03:34.256 --> 03:36.717
No going off campus.
And you carpool to crew.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.552
Don't you think
that's a little bit overkill?

03:38.552 --> 03:40.387
No. If anything, it's underkill.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.347
- Can't homeschool her.
- Why not?

03:42.347 --> 03:44.391
We could teach her the same thing
they're teaching there.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.226
I agree with the need for safety,

03:46.226 --> 03:48.562
but how we implement that,
that is a discussion.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.439
Yeah, maybe one day. But not today.

03:50.439 --> 03:52.149
She needs her independence, babe.

03:52.149 --> 03:55.319
Sure. Listen, what time is crew over?
'Cause I'ma come pick you up

03:55.319 --> 03:56.820
- and make sure that you get home--
- No.

03:57.404 --> 04:01.325
- Trini.
- Look, I'll carpool home.

04:01.909 --> 04:06.246
Okay, it's fine.
I just-- I wanna go to school.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.248
Okay? I'm ready.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.000
If it's too soon, it's too soon.

04:10.501 --> 04:14.630
You said it was my choice,
so do you trust me or not?

04:14.630 --> 04:16.589
Of course.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.926
But you know you can talk to us
if you need to.

04:19.468 --> 04:23.764
The more we communicate as a family,
the better off we're gonna be. Yeah?

04:26.767 --> 04:30.312
<i>As we know, the body of Oakland
mayoral candidate Andrew Finney</i>

04:30.312 --> 04:34.066
<i>was found by an office worker who
discovered the body in the parking garage.</i>

04:34.066 --> 04:35.150
All right, so what's up?

04:35.150 --> 04:38.070
<i>Finney was killed at the site
of his campaign office by an un--</i>

04:39.905 --> 04:45.536
Look, there's something
I need to tell you both.

04:45.536 --> 04:48.080
I think we need to investigate Eva.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.831
What? Why?

04:49.831 --> 04:53.043
Because Andrew Finney trafficked her
when she was just a teenager.

04:53.043 --> 04:53.961
Holy shit.

04:54.795 --> 04:58.799
We don't know that she killed him,
but she obviously had a motive.

04:58.799 --> 05:02.886
Yeah, I felt something was off
when she and I tailed Finney that day.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.847
You're pretty quiet, Aames.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.559
I think Eva was the last person
to see Andrew Finney alive.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.227
She had opportunity.

05:10.227 --> 05:13.313
I found footage of her
in the parking garage at Finney's office

05:13.313 --> 05:15.399
13 minutes before he died.

05:15.399 --> 05:17.109
Okay, hold on. Hold up.

05:17.109 --> 05:21.280
You know, all due respect, Aames, I mean,
that means that there's still a window.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.448
I mean,
the last person to see Finney alive

05:23.448 --> 05:25.117
was the one who was driving that car.

05:25.117 --> 05:27.160
Right. Which could've been Eva.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.580
Or that window means
it could've been Bill Ochoa.

05:29.580 --> 05:31.874
If he was afraid
that Finney could out him,

05:31.874 --> 05:33.792
that's gotta be one hell of a motive, right?

05:33.792 --> 05:36.420
Agreed. Yeah, we need to figure out
who was in that car.

05:36.420 --> 05:38.297
Listen, I gotta go back to the station.

05:38.297 --> 05:39.965
But what are we gonna do about Eva?

05:40.674 --> 05:44.136
Well, we need to find out what she did
after she left Finney's office.

05:44.136 --> 05:47.306
You stay away from her, Poppy.
I know she's been through hell,

05:47.306 --> 05:49.308
but she is a person of interest now.

05:55.814 --> 05:56.815
Hey, Pop.

05:59.401 --> 06:00.819
Can I talk to you for a minute?

06:02.362 --> 06:04.907
No. Not right now, Markus.

06:09.244 --> 06:12.623
I wanna commend you all for stepping up
so soon after the Mills case.

06:13.749 --> 06:16.001
I know you're tired. I am too.

06:16.543 --> 06:20.714
Quick reminder to avoid
the reporters outside, or elsewhere.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.634
The department has no comment
at this time.

06:23.634 --> 06:24.760
We tracked down the servers

06:24.760 --> 06:27.721
that backed up the camera footage
from the mixer house we raided.

06:28.639 --> 06:32.434
The cameras are owned and operated
by one of the johns, Bill Ochoa.

06:33.101 --> 06:36.772
On his servers, we found video
of guys having sex with underage girls

06:36.772 --> 06:38.690
at these mixers over the years.

06:39.274 --> 06:42.694
One of the videos showed Finney
with an underage girl.

06:43.862 --> 06:46.490
I've dispatched officers to arrest Ochoa

06:46.490 --> 06:48.325
for possible extortion and blackmail.

06:48.325 --> 06:49.701
In the meantime,

06:49.701 --> 06:52.329
everyone keep pulling Finney's emails,

06:52.329 --> 06:55.457
contacts, call logs,
bank statements, witnesses.

06:55.457 --> 06:56.959
Finney's killer is still at large,

06:56.959 --> 06:59.628
and the DA wants somebody
in custody yesterday.

06:59.628 --> 07:00.796
Let's get it done.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.382
- Did you get anything from the coworkers?
- No, sir.

07:03.382 --> 07:04.758
Then hit 'em again.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.010
Let me take a shot at Ochoa.

07:08.262 --> 07:10.138
- Why?
- 'Cause I can get to him.

07:11.723 --> 07:13.475
It's personal for me, sir.

07:13.475 --> 07:17.020
Fine. But we got a partial plate
on the car that hit Finney.

07:17.646 --> 07:19.940
After you're done questioning Ochoa,
run it down.

07:20.524 --> 07:24.945
Traced it to a car dealer in the East Bay
run by a Nico Zebka.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.072
Check it out
and let me know what you find.

07:31.118 --> 07:34.162
<i>It's been 48 hours
since the murder of Andrew Finney.</i>

07:34.162 --> 07:36.540
<i>Much of the Bay Area is still in shock</i>

07:36.540 --> 07:39.168
<i>over what some are calling
an assassination.</i>

07:39.168 --> 07:42.796
<i>Police are mystified
as to who killed him and why.</i>

07:42.796 --> 07:45.340
<i>Several suspects
have been brought into custody,</i>

07:45.340 --> 07:48.302
- <i>but as of this broadcast, no charges--</i>
- Girl, you scared me.

07:48.302 --> 07:49.469
Just watching the news.

07:50.387 --> 07:51.388
I'm glad you came.

07:51.388 --> 07:54.016
I-- You know, I keep thinking about
all those other johns

07:54.016 --> 07:56.268
and just feeling like
we should take 'em down ourselves.

07:56.268 --> 07:57.352
Forget OPD.

07:57.352 --> 07:58.520
Yeah, maybe.

07:58.520 --> 08:02.858
But listen, I just saw
some shady guys in the parking lot.

08:02.858 --> 08:05.652
- I tried to scatter 'em, but--
- It's always something.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.446
- One sec.
- Yeah. Okay.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.222
Yeah, let's just push
the budget meeting to 4:00.

08:39.311 --> 08:40.312
Looking for something?

08:41.104 --> 08:42.272
A pen.

08:46.944 --> 08:48.862
Thanks. Did you see 'em?

08:48.862 --> 08:51.031
I'm just trying to remember
the license plate.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.783
No. I missed 'em.

08:54.618 --> 08:58.413
So, when are we gonna focus
on bringing down the other johns?

08:58.914 --> 09:02.251
I can handle that.
I think you should focus on healing.

09:02.251 --> 09:04.127
But this is helping me heal.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.171
Now what?

09:06.171 --> 09:10.801
Well, I was gonna go back through
the videos we got from Ochoa.

09:10.801 --> 09:12.386
Good. I'll join you.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.058
I want a full list
of your contacts in tech.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.768
Is this a witch hunt, Detective?

09:20.352 --> 09:22.396
No. This is a manhunt.

09:22.396 --> 09:26.567
See, I'm trying to find out
why a mayoral candidate was murdered

09:27.234 --> 09:32.656
and why a company owned by Bill here
had videos of men with underage girls,

09:32.656 --> 09:35.117
including one of a young Andrew Finney.

09:35.117 --> 09:36.577
So what was the deal, Bill?

09:36.577 --> 09:39.621
Finney becomes mayor.
He greases the wheels of your businesses.

09:39.621 --> 09:42.958
But then the truth about your trafficking
was gonna get exposed,

09:42.958 --> 09:45.544
so you silenced him.

09:45.544 --> 09:46.962
You don't have to answer that.

09:48.589 --> 09:51.800
I'm an investor. I have a lot of contacts.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.760
I'm not implicated in any of this.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.512
No, you're a rapist, Bill.

09:55.512 --> 09:59.349
And you may also be a trafficker.
Maybe even a killer.

09:59.349 --> 10:03.478
And I'm gonna find the truth,
whether you cooperate or not.

10:03.478 --> 10:07.649
Listen,
my client will beat the statutory charge

10:07.649 --> 10:10.319
because the accuser's
an unreliable witness.

10:10.319 --> 10:12.863
She's a runaway
who had drugs in her system.

10:13.363 --> 10:15.908
The child pornography charge is laughable.

10:15.908 --> 10:18.827
My client had no knowledge
of those videos.

10:18.827 --> 10:20.579
Do you have any other witnesses?

10:22.497 --> 10:26.793
No one's going to testify
that I assaulted anyone, because I didn't.

10:29.087 --> 10:31.715
I don't need another witness.
I already got one.

10:32.758 --> 10:36.803
And when she comes forward,
she's gonna bury you.

10:52.569 --> 10:54.112
Well, that's enough of that.

10:54.863 --> 10:56.615
It's starting to give me hives.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.119
"AF." Is that one of Finney?

11:03.288 --> 11:04.289
Yeah.

11:06.041 --> 11:07.376
Put it on.

11:07.376 --> 11:08.961
- Eva.
- Put it on, Poppy.

11:14.466 --> 11:16.718
<i>One sec. Just gonna use the bathroom.</i>

11:16.718 --> 11:18.053
<i>Take your time.</i>

11:22.683 --> 11:23.684
Oh, my God.

11:23.684 --> 11:26.353
- What?
- That's Nadia.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.689
The girl you told me about?
From your interview?

11:29.356 --> 11:31.859
- Yeah.
- Holy shit.

11:32.860 --> 11:36.321
She knew there was a camera there.
Did she trap Finney?

11:37.531 --> 11:38.532
We gotta find her.

11:38.532 --> 11:41.785
She could be the key to figuring out
how the tape ended up with Bill Ochoa

11:41.785 --> 11:42.870
and who else has seen it,

11:42.870 --> 11:45.122
which might lead us
to Finney's blackmailer.

11:45.122 --> 11:47.791
Okay. Just hold on, okay? Slow down.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.251
Why are you trying to slow-walk me?

11:49.251 --> 11:51.461
I'm not trying to slow-walk you, Eva.

11:52.254 --> 11:55.132
Things are tense.
I'm just trying to be cautious.

11:55.132 --> 11:57.342
For whom? For me or for you?

11:58.343 --> 12:00.095
- Eva.
- You know what? Let me cut to the chase.

12:00.095 --> 12:02.431
I do know Nadia's last name.

12:03.265 --> 12:06.310
You wanna find her, you'll need my help.

12:11.440 --> 12:12.441
Yeah.

12:12.941 --> 12:15.027
Ain't no fun
when the rabbit got the gun, huh?

12:16.528 --> 12:18.655
I gotta go to school,
but I'll call you when I find her.

12:44.556 --> 12:46.475
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:47.726 --> 12:49.394
It is wild being back in school.

12:50.062 --> 12:52.731
I never thought I'd miss the smell
of cafeteria mac and cheese,

12:52.731 --> 12:55.317
but it hits different
when you haven't had it in so long.

12:57.194 --> 13:00.155
I met this girl in history class
who said we'd hang later. You wanna come?

13:00.739 --> 13:03.492
No. I have a lot of studying
to catch up on.

13:03.992 --> 13:05.994
I'm kind of stressed
that I'm falling behind.

13:05.994 --> 13:08.956
- Okay.
- Hey, Trini. How's it going?

13:10.582 --> 13:12.292
- Fine.
- That's good.

13:12.292 --> 13:16.213
So, when is Aubrey getting out of juvie?
I heard he's, like, in a ton of trouble.

13:16.213 --> 13:19.341
But wait, how did it work
with you not getting into trouble?

13:19.341 --> 13:21.051
And Melanie, genuine question,

13:21.051 --> 13:22.719
but shouldn't you be in trouble too

13:22.719 --> 13:25.097
since you were, like,
a legit prostitute or something?

13:27.641 --> 13:29.309
What a slut.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.228
You know,

13:32.688 --> 13:36.483
I'd say some stupid shit too if I was
as fucking ugly as you are, Catie.

13:37.943 --> 13:39.069
Screw you both.

13:44.825 --> 13:47.452
I don't need you to fight for me. Okay?

13:51.790 --> 13:53.292
- Hey, Daddy.
- Hey.

13:54.710 --> 13:55.961
What are you doing here?

13:57.462 --> 13:59.631
Well, we haven't talked since we saw Bug.

13:59.631 --> 14:02.759
I'm just still trying to figure out
how I feel about it.

14:04.219 --> 14:05.220
About Mama.

14:05.804 --> 14:11.518
I don't know
if her sacrifice was noble or selfish.

14:14.396 --> 14:16.023
We just knew pieces of her.

14:16.523 --> 14:19.193
The whole time
I thought she stepped out on me.

14:21.195 --> 14:25.699
I feel disgusted with myself
for thinking I wasn't enough.

14:26.742 --> 14:28.744
I had no idea what she was going through,

14:28.744 --> 14:31.205
'cause if I had,
I would've killed Alexander that day.

14:31.955 --> 14:34.833
It's hard to accept that I didn't know
that piece of her.

14:38.003 --> 14:41.089
Made me wonder
what I don't know about my daughters.

14:41.089 --> 14:43.884
- What are you talking about?
- I didn't know about you and Shirley.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.970
Maybe Des and Cydie
are carrying a secret pain too.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.096
I j--

14:49.014 --> 14:52.309
I just wanna know that you all are okay
when I'm no longer around.

14:52.309 --> 14:55.270
Daddy, you know I hate it
when you say stuff like that.

14:55.270 --> 14:57.564
I'm not gonna always be here
to protect the family.

14:58.815 --> 15:01.151
That responsibility
will one day belong to you.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.739
Are you gonna tell your sisters
what Bug said?

15:10.911 --> 15:14.039
Well, whatever you decide,

15:14.039 --> 15:17.334
the last thing this family needs
is something to tear us apart.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.799
Nico's customer service center, line 2.

15:23.799 --> 15:28.637
Hey, thanks for giving me the call.
You know, helps get my mind off things.

15:28.637 --> 15:30.097
Listen, Markus.

15:31.723 --> 15:34.601
I called you
'cause there's something I need from you.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.937
What is this? You giving me the okey doke?

15:36.937 --> 15:38.897
I'm just trying to be straight with you.

15:39.898 --> 15:41.567
All right. Well, then go ahead.
Spit it out.

15:42.067 --> 15:46.572
I need Trini to testify against Bill Ochoa
in a preliminary hearing.

15:46.572 --> 15:48.407
The initial ID isn't enough.

15:49.575 --> 15:54.037
The longer we wait, the more Ochoa's
lawyers are gonna poke holes in her story.

15:54.037 --> 15:55.372
Now, with Trini's help,

15:55.372 --> 15:59.251
I think we can get him for her assault
and possibly Finney's murder.

16:01.753 --> 16:02.754
Well, I'll ask her.

16:02.754 --> 16:07.676
You know, if it means
finally getting his ass into prison,

16:07.676 --> 16:11.805
I'm sure she'll do it. I hope.

16:12.681 --> 16:15.017
All right. Keep me posted.

16:17.978 --> 16:18.812
Okay.

16:18.812 --> 16:21.023
Yeah, I'm not really sure how I can help.

16:21.023 --> 16:23.650
Really? 'Cause the car
that came from your dealership

16:23.650 --> 16:25.444
was used in the murder of Andrew Finney.

16:25.444 --> 16:27.946
Which makes you an accessory.

16:27.946 --> 16:29.531
Well, not to mention conspiracy to murder.

16:29.531 --> 16:31.783
I didn't even think about that.
Yeah, that's a good call.

16:31.783 --> 16:33.869
- And that's just what we know, right?
- Right. Exactly.

16:33.869 --> 16:36.538
Hold on. I had no idea
what that car was being used for.

16:37.581 --> 16:39.166
But you knew it was being used.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.793
I get requests to send cars to events
all the time.

16:41.793 --> 16:42.920
What kind of events?

16:42.920 --> 16:45.047
I don't know.
I'm not fucking invited to them.

16:45.047 --> 16:47.549
I receive the request and I fill it.

16:47.549 --> 16:50.177
I swear.
My buddy, Kevin Sun, hooked me up.

16:50.177 --> 16:52.054
Look, I screenshot every one.

16:56.183 --> 16:58.644
These are in Questeur,
but I've never seen the app like this.

16:58.644 --> 17:01.230
- When did you get these?
- I don't know. I get a bunch of 'em.

17:01.230 --> 17:03.106
You got one on the 11th.

17:03.607 --> 17:05.108
It's the same night as the mixer.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.277
Who sends you these messages?

17:07.277 --> 17:10.696
They're anonymous.
I just-- I get the info and I do it.

17:10.696 --> 17:11.823
And you don't respond?

17:11.823 --> 17:14.867
You can't. It's kind of a one-way thing.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.494
That's not how the app is known to work.

17:17.162 --> 17:18.789
I'm gonna need copies of these.

17:23.961 --> 17:27.047
You're sure Aames thinks
this is the best way to charge Ochoa?

17:27.047 --> 17:30.259
Not just the best way.
It may be the key to the whole thing.

17:32.386 --> 17:33.846
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:33.846 --> 17:35.264
Well, how'd school go?

17:37.099 --> 17:38.767
What's going on?

17:39.893 --> 17:45.732
Sweetheart, Aames thinks that
Bill Ochoa could've been Finney's killer.

17:45.732 --> 17:50.153
And they wanna stack charges against him,
including assault.

17:50.946 --> 17:52.614
But he needs you to testify.

17:53.448 --> 17:57.619
That means talking about what happened.
Naming him.

17:59.454 --> 18:00.747
This is what you guys want?

18:00.747 --> 18:02.499
Only if you're up to it.

18:06.086 --> 18:07.588
Okay. Yeah.

18:10.674 --> 18:12.426
I've got homework. Good night.

18:26.732 --> 18:27.733
Eva?

18:46.877 --> 18:47.878
I knew it.

18:48.504 --> 18:50.464
I knew you were sneaking around
the other day.

18:52.508 --> 18:53.717
What do you want, Poppy?

18:53.717 --> 18:56.011
The truth, for once.

18:56.011 --> 18:57.095
The truth?

18:58.555 --> 19:00.766
Why don't you tell me
what you think happened?

19:00.766 --> 19:02.476
What you've got all figured out?

19:03.018 --> 19:04.228
You lied to me, Eva.

19:05.354 --> 19:07.856
You used me to get closer to Finney.

19:07.856 --> 19:10.359
And when you thought
you couldn't get justice,

19:10.359 --> 19:11.443
you went to see him.

19:12.152 --> 19:13.278
We saw you on camera.

19:14.613 --> 19:16.490
You think I killed Finney?

19:18.617 --> 19:20.577
- I didn't kill him.
- Then why were you there?

19:20.577 --> 19:22.788
Oh, my God. I'll tell you
the same thing I just told the cops.

19:22.788 --> 19:24.289
So, they questioned you?

19:24.289 --> 19:27.501
Yeah, Poppy. Thanks for that.

19:28.377 --> 19:31.672
I'll repeat myself because that's clearly
the only way to get through to you.

19:32.422 --> 19:35.175
All I did was talk to him.

19:35.175 --> 19:36.885
Why wouldn't you just tell me that?

19:36.885 --> 19:39.763
Because you would've told me not to go,
that I was jeopardizing the case.

19:39.763 --> 19:40.848
And trust me...

19:42.099 --> 19:43.976
I wish I was driving that car.

19:45.185 --> 19:46.687
I wish I could trust you.

19:48.355 --> 19:49.356
Did you ever?

19:54.403 --> 19:57.406
I can tell you are losing a little bit
of weight from all these salads and stuff.

19:57.406 --> 19:59.616
- Your neck look real good.
- I'm trying. My neck looks good?

19:59.616 --> 20:01.410
Yeah. That's the part that you really--

20:01.410 --> 20:03.495
When you're losing weight,
the neck goes first.

20:03.996 --> 20:05.247
Yes, because you have--

20:05.247 --> 20:06.665
Hey, girls. Come see me.

20:07.165 --> 20:08.584
Did he just summon us?

20:09.084 --> 20:11.712
Yeah. What did you do?

20:12.379 --> 20:13.547
I ain't do shit.

20:14.715 --> 20:16.675
- Poppy.
- Poppy. Oh, geez.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.139
Hey, Daddy. What's going on?

20:22.139 --> 20:25.934
- You need some help with something?
- No, I'm fine. Have a seat.

20:29.354 --> 20:31.732
I've been meaning to ask both of you.

20:33.609 --> 20:35.444
What do you wanna do with your lives?

20:36.236 --> 20:38.739
Is that a real question?

20:38.739 --> 20:40.616
Yeah, Daddy, what's this about?

20:40.616 --> 20:41.867
Look, I'm just trying to--

20:42.910 --> 20:43.911
I'm just--

20:46.413 --> 20:49.625
I've made decisions for you girls
that have shaped your lives.

20:49.625 --> 20:52.211
Yeah, well,
that's how it's supposed to be.

20:52.211 --> 20:55.297
And I've been thinking a lot
about what we leave behind.

20:56.673 --> 20:59.134
The MC, The Knock.

21:00.802 --> 21:03.847
You girls are my most precious legacy.

21:03.847 --> 21:05.682
Did something happen at the doctor's?

21:05.682 --> 21:07.017
- Did they tell you--
- Des--

21:07.017 --> 21:09.645
No. This has nothing to do with the CTE.

21:10.229 --> 21:11.688
I'm just trying to tell you girls

21:11.688 --> 21:15.108
if there's anything you wanted to do
with your lives that you didn't,

21:15.108 --> 21:17.861
because you were afraid
of how I might react,

21:17.861 --> 21:20.364
or you felt like you had to hide from me,

21:20.364 --> 21:23.242
I don't wanna stop you from doing
those things, saying those things.

21:23.242 --> 21:24.618
I never wanted to be--

21:25.994 --> 21:28.247
I never wanted The Knock to be a burden.

21:30.791 --> 21:31.875
Yeah.

21:40.133 --> 21:42.803
You sure this is where Nico said
he was told to drop off the car?

21:42.803 --> 21:45.806
Yeah. I'm not seeing any cameras.

21:48.016 --> 21:49.309
Listen, I was gonna ask you...

21:51.311 --> 21:53.730
did you miss OPD when you left?

21:54.690 --> 21:56.275
You thinking about stepping away?

21:57.568 --> 22:00.737
This whole Emily Mills thing,
the way they treated Drea, Trini--

22:00.737 --> 22:04.032
I'm just not sure I belong there.

22:04.741 --> 22:06.034
The private sector's not bad.

22:06.034 --> 22:08.704
The pension is obviously not that great,

22:08.704 --> 22:10.289
but the work can be better...

22:11.623 --> 22:12.624
with the right people.

22:13.584 --> 22:14.668
That's what I was thinking.

22:17.087 --> 22:19.089
Hey, excuse me. I'm with the OPD.

22:19.590 --> 22:22.509
Just wondering if you might've seen
a black Chevy Impala

22:22.509 --> 22:23.886
parked around here the last few days?

22:23.886 --> 22:25.387
This is what it looks like.

22:26.972 --> 22:30.350
Yeah. That car was parked here
a while back. Right over there.

22:30.934 --> 22:32.311
Did you see who drove it off?

22:33.103 --> 22:35.606
I sure did. Pretty little thing.

22:35.606 --> 22:36.815
A woman?

22:36.815 --> 22:38.483
Black girl. Young.

22:40.777 --> 22:43.906
- Is that her?
- Nope. Younger than her.

22:50.329 --> 22:51.622
Any of these girls?

23:00.547 --> 23:02.299
No, not her either.

23:02.966 --> 23:05.886
The girl who drove that car off
isn't in them pictures.

23:05.886 --> 23:10.057
Listen, I'm gonna get someone down here,
and you can describe the girl to her.

23:10.057 --> 23:12.351
- Do I get paid?
- Yeah, we'll work something out.

23:12.851 --> 23:13.894
Thanks.

23:13.894 --> 23:14.978
Thank you.

23:17.564 --> 23:21.026
So Nico was told by a user on Questeur
to drop off the car?

23:21.026 --> 23:21.944
Uh-huh.

23:21.944 --> 23:25.906
And there's this one-way messaging
function hidden within Questeur?

23:25.906 --> 23:28.408
Exactly. But according to Nico,

23:28.408 --> 23:31.453
the messages were encrypted,
so there's no way to know who sent them.

23:33.497 --> 23:34.790
What?

23:36.375 --> 23:38.001
I think we might've both been wrong.

23:38.001 --> 23:40.838
I'm gonna need you
to be a little more specific.

23:40.838 --> 23:43.173
I'm talking about Eva and Bill Ochoa.

23:43.173 --> 23:44.675
- How so?
- Look.

23:47.970 --> 23:50.013
Aames has a sketch artist
who's working with a guy

23:50.013 --> 23:53.141
who might be able to ID the person
who was driving the car.

23:53.642 --> 23:57.312
Now, he says it was a young woman,
but he ruled Eva out.

23:57.312 --> 23:59.481
- He could be wrong.
- Maybe.

24:01.608 --> 24:06.154
But then that would mean
Bill Ochoa didn't kill Finney either.

24:06.154 --> 24:09.199
But it doesn't mean he can't be the head
of the sex trafficking ring.

24:09.992 --> 24:12.452
But, yeah, he's not our killer.

24:12.452 --> 24:14.955
Do you think he could have built
the messaging function?

24:14.955 --> 24:17.916
No, but he has enough money
to pay someone to do it.

24:19.042 --> 24:22.880
Then it's probably only accessible
by whoever created it.

24:22.880 --> 24:26.175
Yeah, but if that isn't Bill,
then who is it?

24:27.885 --> 24:29.970
I need to talk to Lee Hackman.

24:39.021 --> 24:40.022
Poppy?

24:41.231 --> 24:42.691
- Sybil.
- Yes.

24:42.691 --> 24:45.944
- So good to see you again.
- Likewise.

24:45.944 --> 24:48.780
I had a really nice lunch
with your father the other day.

24:48.780 --> 24:49.865
Is that right?

24:50.574 --> 24:54.620
- So what are you doing here?
- Actually, I came to see Lee.

24:55.245 --> 24:56.496
Is everything okay?

24:58.040 --> 25:02.211
Honestly, I don't know, but it's urgent.
It's about your company.

25:04.213 --> 25:06.840
I don't think Lee is being honest with me.

25:07.341 --> 25:08.342
I'm sorry.

25:08.342 --> 25:10.844
He tends to do things his way,

25:10.844 --> 25:15.557
and his boys' club needs to be brought
into the 21st century.

25:15.557 --> 25:16.642
Come on.

25:18.769 --> 25:20.854
And the grid will be
fully disconnected, but--

25:22.314 --> 25:24.525
- Sybil, I'm in the middle of a meeting.
- I know.

25:24.525 --> 25:27.653
Finalizing plans for
the big groundbreaking ceremony next week.

25:27.653 --> 25:29.613
- That can wait.
- Okay.

25:30.113 --> 25:31.740
You guys wanna give us a minute?

25:32.366 --> 25:34.868
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

25:35.452 --> 25:36.912
Well...

25:40.541 --> 25:42.251
Okay, you have my attention.

25:42.251 --> 25:44.920
There's something suspicious
about your Questeur app.

25:44.920 --> 25:47.714
We found a hidden messaging function
within the app.

25:55.806 --> 25:58.308
- How did you find this?
- Lee.

25:58.308 --> 26:00.811
No. This isn't me.
I've never seen it before.

26:02.396 --> 26:07.526
Well, whoever built it has been using it
to send private anonymous messages.

26:07.526 --> 26:11.905
And I think those messages are being used
to operate a sex trafficking ring.

26:11.905 --> 26:14.199
Well, I have hundreds of engineers
who work here.

26:14.199 --> 26:16.493
Any one of them
could have planted that, right?

26:16.493 --> 26:17.911
According to my research,

26:17.911 --> 26:22.583
that same messaging function could have
been used to orchestrate Finney's murder.

26:23.792 --> 26:28.380
I am not involved in sex trafficking
or murder. That's insane.

26:28.380 --> 26:33.093
And if you wanna pursue this absurd claim,
have fun wasting your time.

26:33.969 --> 26:35.137
I actually have work to do.

26:43.312 --> 26:44.313
Ezra.

26:45.063 --> 26:48.901
You deleted a podcast testimony
of a survivor?

26:48.901 --> 26:49.818
What?

26:49.818 --> 26:53.238
I get a call that says that
you intentionally sabotaged the story.

26:53.238 --> 26:56.074
That a survivor who was one
of Finney's victims came forward.

26:56.074 --> 26:57.659
I didn't sabotage the story.

26:57.659 --> 27:00.412
- Then what did you do?
- I made a call.

27:00.412 --> 27:02.956
I didn't think
it needed to be included in the cut.

27:02.956 --> 27:05.417
Well, clearly it might've had
major implications on the case

27:05.417 --> 27:08.170
because it happened
before he was fucking killed, Poppy.

27:08.170 --> 27:11.423
You can't penalize me for that.
I don't have a crystal ball.

27:11.423 --> 27:12.674
So it's all true then?

27:12.674 --> 27:15.636
Just listen. Just calm down
and hear me out. Let's talk this out.

27:15.636 --> 27:18.597
No. You have been lying to me, Poppy.

27:19.223 --> 27:20.390
I don't work with liars.

27:20.974 --> 27:21.975
What does that mean?

27:22.476 --> 27:24.978
It means I might take legal action
against you

27:24.978 --> 27:27.898
to have you remunerate the entire deal
back to Boisterous.

27:27.898 --> 27:28.982
- What--
- That's what it means.

27:28.982 --> 27:30.984
- Wait. What? Ezra.
- No.

27:30.984 --> 27:33.654
- Listen, we can talk about this-- Ezr--
- No. We're done.

27:39.034 --> 27:40.994
- Hello?
- Are you fucking kidding me?

27:40.994 --> 27:43.664
What? You don't like
when the truth is used against you?

27:43.664 --> 27:46.291
- You're fucking with my livelihood.
- And you fucked with my life.

27:46.291 --> 27:49.545
You didn't have to work with me.
You could have walked away at any time.

27:49.545 --> 27:51.129
Bullshit. You would have chased me

27:51.129 --> 27:53.048
to the ends of the earth
to get your fucking story.

27:53.048 --> 27:56.468
Like you didn't show up at my house
asking for help.

27:57.052 --> 28:00.639
Look,
I'm sorry I accused you of killing Finney.

28:01.306 --> 28:04.434
All I ever wanted to do was help you.
Help all those girls.

28:04.434 --> 28:08.355
You know what your problem is?
You don't like being the bad guy.

28:09.565 --> 28:10.649
Even when you are.

28:10.649 --> 28:15.445
Eva, Boisterous just threatened
to have me pay back my entire deal.

28:15.445 --> 28:17.781
I could lose my house.
I could lose everything.

28:17.781 --> 28:18.907
I told the truth.

28:18.907 --> 28:21.076
Oh, f-- "Truth."

28:27.165 --> 28:30.377
Got the artist's rendering
of the suspect who drove the car.

28:37.092 --> 28:39.469
- That's Rochelle.
- Who?

28:43.265 --> 28:45.017
Rochelle Johnson.

28:49.813 --> 28:51.064
Let's go get her.

29:11.460 --> 29:12.461
Okay.

29:17.716 --> 29:20.010
<i>I got you something. Yeah.</i>

29:31.230 --> 29:33.315
- Your turn.
- No.

29:38.237 --> 29:39.238
No.

29:44.743 --> 29:45.744
Mom! Dad!

29:47.454 --> 29:51.291
Wait, please! Wait!

29:53.961 --> 29:55.420
Yo, why is she scared?

30:05.472 --> 30:07.266
Sorry.

30:08.058 --> 30:09.935
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

30:09.935 --> 30:11.103
Come to my office.

30:12.813 --> 30:14.481
You don't have to pretend to be okay.

30:16.316 --> 30:17.317
Yes, I do.

30:18.902 --> 30:19.736
Why?

30:21.071 --> 30:25.492
Because if I'm not perfect,
then everything will fall apart.

30:26.493 --> 30:28.787
- What makes you think that?
- 'Cause it already has.

30:31.915 --> 30:32.916
My dad--

30:34.835 --> 30:36.545
This is a safe space.

30:36.545 --> 30:39.214
Everything you say
in here is confidential.

30:45.554 --> 30:49.600
My parents do better when I do better.

30:51.018 --> 30:54.354
So I have to be okay.
I have to be good again.

30:56.607 --> 31:00.360
Which is why I have to focus on school
and testifying against my--

31:02.404 --> 31:04.114
Do your parents know how you feel?

31:08.035 --> 31:09.786
I know how hard this feels right now.

31:10.370 --> 31:11.538
No, you don't.

31:17.377 --> 31:18.378
Look at me.

31:20.005 --> 31:26.094
When I was your age, I was in the
exact same position you're in right now.

31:27.346 --> 31:29.848
The exact same position.

31:30.432 --> 31:31.475
I made mistakes.

31:33.977 --> 31:37.606
Some weren't my fault, but some were.

31:40.192 --> 31:42.486
I'm just afraid to tell them how I feel.

31:45.364 --> 31:46.949
Especially my dad. He--

31:50.202 --> 31:51.870
He's not well.

31:51.870 --> 31:52.996
I'll tell you what.

31:54.248 --> 31:55.499
How about we make a pact?

31:56.542 --> 31:59.127
If you do the thing you're afraid of, I...

32:03.006 --> 32:05.467
will commit to being accountable
for my mistakes.

32:06.468 --> 32:08.303
And if you testify against your attacker,

32:08.303 --> 32:11.765
I will be right there with you
every step of the way.

32:13.267 --> 32:14.309
I promise.

32:38.834 --> 32:39.835
I'm surprised you came.

32:39.835 --> 32:41.253
Surprised you called.

32:44.673 --> 32:46.717
I'm sorry I reacted the way I did.

32:47.426 --> 32:49.303
Is everything gonna be okay
with Boisterous?

32:49.803 --> 32:50.804
I don't know yet.

32:52.472 --> 32:53.807
I'll figure it out.

32:54.600 --> 32:55.601
Look.

32:57.102 --> 33:00.647
I never wanted you to feel like
I didn't believe you,

33:00.647 --> 33:03.275
or that I was trying to control you.

33:03.275 --> 33:04.568
I wasn't.

33:04.568 --> 33:05.652
I just--

33:07.237 --> 33:11.033
I needed to protect those girls
because I could have been one of them too.

33:13.452 --> 33:16.830
Rochelle was driving the car
that hit Finney.

33:17.372 --> 33:18.373
Do you trust me now?

33:20.792 --> 33:22.211
Aames is looking for her.

33:22.794 --> 33:23.795
But...

33:23.795 --> 33:28.050
But I still don't understand why Rochelle,
of all people,

33:28.050 --> 33:29.551
was the one to pick up the car.

33:29.551 --> 33:30.844
Maybe she had nothing to lose.

33:30.844 --> 33:32.888
But what did she stand to gain?

33:33.639 --> 33:37.226
There's no way
she's been orchestrating this ring.

33:37.226 --> 33:39.353
I think I know someone that can help us.

33:40.938 --> 33:41.939
I found Nadia.

33:42.648 --> 33:44.650
I got her address a while ago, actually,

33:44.650 --> 33:46.777
but I was too afraid to face her.

33:50.280 --> 33:53.200
Funny enough, I got strength from Trini.

33:53.700 --> 33:56.954
Trini. She's a brave one.

33:59.248 --> 34:04.711
With her help, we may finally get justice.
For all of you.

34:14.346 --> 34:15.848
How was school today, honey?

34:23.105 --> 34:26.775
- Work okay?
- You know. Is what it is.

34:32.072 --> 34:33.699
Okay, what's going on with you two?

34:34.199 --> 34:37.369
Nothing, baby.
You know, just tired is all.

34:37.953 --> 34:40.371
And I'm not?
Listen, you've been absent for days.

34:40.371 --> 34:42.123
I don't know what's going on with you,
babe, but--

34:42.123 --> 34:43.417
It's because he's drinking.

34:47.545 --> 34:50.174
I saw him drinking in his office.

34:55.219 --> 34:56.221
Look, I--

34:57.054 --> 34:59.558
- I know, okay? I know. Listen.
- No.

34:59.558 --> 35:01.393
- You can't do this to me, Markus.
- It hasn't been easy.

35:01.393 --> 35:03.228
- You can't do this to us.
- I've been trying, all right?

35:03.228 --> 35:04.479
- Really?
- I know.

35:04.479 --> 35:06.148
- I thought we'd been through this.
- Can I talk?

35:06.148 --> 35:07.691
Right now? You're gonna do this right now?

35:07.691 --> 35:09.359
- Allow me to talk!
- How are you doing this to me--

35:09.359 --> 35:12.946
Stop! Just stop fighting, please.

35:15.407 --> 35:19.119
Do you wanna know how school was?
It was terrible.

35:21.580 --> 35:23.874
Because your perfect girl failed.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.043
Okay? I failed.

35:26.043 --> 35:28.086
It's okay, honey. It's okay.

35:28.086 --> 35:29.713
No, it's not okay.

35:30.797 --> 35:35.093
- He's drinking because of me.
- No. Okay, baby? No. All right?

35:36.929 --> 35:38.013
It's not your fault.

35:38.597 --> 35:41.350
It never has been, and it never will be.

35:42.351 --> 35:44.561
I have to take responsibility
for what I did.

35:45.062 --> 35:47.147
And I know I put pressure on you,

35:47.147 --> 35:50.692
but my love for you is not conditional
on you getting good grades.

35:51.693 --> 35:54.279
Anything like that. It never was.

35:54.947 --> 35:57.115
I'm sorry I made you feel that way.

35:57.115 --> 35:59.326
We both love you very much, baby girl.

36:00.661 --> 36:04.540
And I never meant to put that burden
on you.

36:06.625 --> 36:07.793
- Okay?
- Yeah.

36:18.846 --> 36:20.347
Sure you wanna do this?

36:38.323 --> 36:40.534
Hi. I'm Poppy Scoville.

36:40.534 --> 36:43.203
I know who you are. What do you want?

36:51.086 --> 36:52.087
Hi.

36:52.796 --> 36:54.882
I'm sorry to come here like this.

36:58.969 --> 37:00.220
It's so good to see you.

37:01.346 --> 37:08.145
Nadia, I have so much shame
around everything that happened.

37:09.396 --> 37:11.982
But I just wanted you to know
that I'm trying.

37:13.192 --> 37:14.610
I'm trying to make amends...

37:19.072 --> 37:20.157
for what I did.

37:21.533 --> 37:26.914
You don't have to forgive me,
but I want you to know how sorry I am.

37:29.791 --> 37:31.376
You're the reason I was trafficked.

37:34.338 --> 37:36.006
The reason I was branded.

37:37.174 --> 37:40.052
The reason my life changed forever.

37:41.011 --> 37:42.679
But I'm a different person now.

37:44.723 --> 37:46.433
Done a lot of healing since then.

37:50.479 --> 37:51.772
I forgive you.

38:00.531 --> 38:01.532
Thank you.

38:02.533 --> 38:05.160
So if you know
that Rochelle killed Finney,

38:05.160 --> 38:06.411
what do you need me for?

38:06.995 --> 38:10.958
I don't think
Rochelle is operating the ring.

38:10.958 --> 38:13.502
Somebody else was blackmailing Finney.

38:14.419 --> 38:18.465
- It wasn't me.
- No. N-- That's not what we're saying.

38:19.550 --> 38:23.220
But there is an old video of you and him.

38:24.179 --> 38:28.267
When that video was made,
did he know you were recording him?

38:30.143 --> 38:31.144
No.

38:32.479 --> 38:35.440
He sent me to one of his friends,
but his friend wasn't interested.

38:35.941 --> 38:38.986
And a couple of days later, I got
an anonymous message from the friend.

38:39.653 --> 38:41.446
- Anonymous?
- Yeah.

38:41.446 --> 38:42.990
He must've had some beef with Finney

38:42.990 --> 38:47.244
because he messaged me
to set up this camera to get revenge.

38:47.244 --> 38:48.912
What was in it for you?

38:48.912 --> 38:52.916
I just wanted enough to pay for college
and start a new life.

38:52.916 --> 38:55.836
And I made him promise to pull strings
to get me into Stanford.

38:56.628 --> 38:59.715
Who was he? The friend.

39:00.215 --> 39:01.466
Was it Lee Hackman?

39:02.259 --> 39:03.927
How did you know?

39:03.927 --> 39:07.973
I think Lee Hackman has been lying to us
this entire time.

39:07.973 --> 39:10.893
- You think he had Finney killed?
- I don't know.

39:11.935 --> 39:14.438
But I think he might be the head
of this trafficking ring.

39:23.655 --> 39:24.990
- Hey, Daddy.
- Hey.

39:34.875 --> 39:35.876
Thank you.

39:43.926 --> 39:48.305
All my life, I needed Mama to be perfect

39:48.305 --> 39:52.643
because all my life
I've been grieving her.

39:53.769 --> 39:58.398
What she sacrificed
to keep her pain from us, it's...

40:00.651 --> 40:02.069
overwhelming me, Daddy.

40:02.069 --> 40:03.445
I know, sweetheart. I know.

40:03.987 --> 40:10.327
I think Mama's suffering,
keeping her secrets, is what hurt us.

40:11.036 --> 40:12.788
Hurt our family for so long.

40:14.790 --> 40:16.291
You might be right, Popsicle.

40:21.046 --> 40:27.261
I saw two people come together today
after a lifetime of secrets.

40:28.679 --> 40:30.138
Saw how it healed them.

40:30.806 --> 40:36.770
I'm done keeping mine from Des and Cydie.
I'm done.

40:37.271 --> 40:40.649
Your sisters are strong.
They'll understand.

40:43.151 --> 40:44.152
We're family.

40:45.320 --> 40:46.321
Always will be.

40:53.245 --> 40:58.625
The hardest part about secrets
is the carnage left in their wake.

41:00.085 --> 41:04.089
Secrets isolate you
from everything you cherish,

41:04.089 --> 41:09.261
everything that defines you,
until you lose all sense of yourself.

41:10.262 --> 41:12.681
<i>And it is precisely at that moment</i>

41:12.681 --> 41:17.186
<i>that you are most vulnerable
to exploitation.</i>

41:17.853 --> 41:21.231
<i>This ring of traffickers was only possible</i>

41:21.815 --> 41:26.028
because so many people were willing
to keep secrets.

41:26.778 --> 41:32.826
<i>So many people were willing to silo
young women until they were obliterated.</i>

41:33.952 --> 41:39.333
A young woman deep in the life,
named Rochelle,

41:39.333 --> 41:42.461
has been identified
as Andrew Finney's killer.

41:43.003 --> 41:45.214
So far, she's evaded capture.

41:45.214 --> 41:50.594
One could only assume
her act was yet another desperate attempt

41:51.637 --> 41:53.680
to keep secrets buried.

41:53.680 --> 41:57.768
But to be frank, I'm done with secrets.

41:58.685 --> 42:03.106
<i>I'm done with the people who use them
to hurt others.</i>

42:03.857 --> 42:05.442
<i>So I wanna make a promise to you.</i>

42:06.235 --> 42:11.949
<i>Whoever was or is running
this trafficking ring is still at large.</i>

42:11.949 --> 42:14.993
<i>And I will find them.</i>

42:16.787 --> 42:21.667
And I promise to never keep the truth
from you.

42:22.626 --> 42:24.711
My name is Poppy Scoville,

42:26.380 --> 42:29.967
and I'd like you to reconsider.

42:32.302 --> 42:34.054
I can't believe Mama and this man.

42:35.430 --> 42:38.183
That's obviously why Daddy was acting
so weird the other day.

42:39.268 --> 42:42.938
I've been wanting to tell y'all
for a while,

42:43.605 --> 42:44.982
but I was afraid...

42:46.942 --> 42:47.985
that you'd hate me.

42:48.652 --> 42:50.654
Hate y-- Why?

42:51.530 --> 42:53.156
That I was tearing us apart.

42:53.657 --> 42:54.908
No.

42:56.034 --> 42:59.246
No. Never.

42:59.997 --> 43:01.665
You are our sister, Poppy,

43:02.291 --> 43:06.420
but this man, Alexander,
it makes me think about Melanie.

43:09.506 --> 43:14.595
If she left me for her biological parents,
it would kill me.

43:15.262 --> 43:19.308
Nothing is gonna change
how she feels about you.

43:20.225 --> 43:22.895
Biology isn't the only thing
that makes you a parent.

43:24.229 --> 43:25.230
Okay?

43:27.065 --> 43:29.067
Is it hella corny to say that I love you?

43:29.985 --> 43:31.653
And I love this weird-ass family.

43:32.613 --> 43:33.614
It is.

43:34.406 --> 43:35.741
But I'll allow it.

43:38.452 --> 43:39.745
I love y'all.

43:42.915 --> 43:44.458
What happened to our sister?

43:44.458 --> 43:46.585
- I don't know her.
- Hey.

43:46.585 --> 43:48.504
This family is so fucked up.

43:49.129 --> 43:51.507
What's going on?
I mean, is it our birthday?

43:51.507 --> 43:53.884
- Say it again.
- Did hell freeze over?

43:53.884 --> 43:55.302
You love us.

44:01.683 --> 44:02.893
Hey, y'all.

44:02.893 --> 44:04.102
- Hey.
- Hi.

44:05.062 --> 44:06.063
How you doing, Trini?

44:06.688 --> 44:07.731
Better. Thank you.

44:07.731 --> 44:10.108
- And Aames is on the way.
- Good.

44:10.108 --> 44:11.944
Well, anybody want anything from the cart?

44:13.445 --> 44:14.780
- Honey?
- I'm okay.

44:14.780 --> 44:15.864
- I'm good.
- You sure?

44:15.864 --> 44:18.367
- Yeah. Thank you.
- I'm just gonna pick something up.

44:18.367 --> 44:19.451
Okay.

44:19.451 --> 44:21.537
- Hey. How're you doing?
- Hey. I'm really good.

44:22.037 --> 44:23.247
Hey, Principal Pierre.

44:23.247 --> 44:25.916
- Hi. How are you?
- Thank you for coming.

44:28.293 --> 44:29.670
They know about the drinking.

44:30.546 --> 44:33.006
Trini saw me. Outed me last night.

44:35.008 --> 44:37.719
But it was good though.
You know, in a fucked-up kind of way,

44:37.719 --> 44:41.139
it was like the first time
we felt like a family again.

44:42.850 --> 44:45.102
Believe me, I know what you mean.

44:45.102 --> 44:46.186
Hey, listen.

44:48.355 --> 44:50.148
I'm real sorry about the kiss.

44:50.148 --> 44:52.150
For putting you in that position,
you know?

44:56.071 --> 44:58.031
- We should probably get something.
- Yeah.

44:59.241 --> 45:00.701
Can I get two coffees, please?

45:00.701 --> 45:02.202
Two coffees coming up.

45:03.954 --> 45:04.955
There he is.

45:05.497 --> 45:06.665
- Hey.
- Hey.

45:06.665 --> 45:07.749
Where you been?

45:09.251 --> 45:13.338
Thought I had a lead on Rochelle.
Turned out to be a no-go.

45:13.338 --> 45:16.216
Maybe whoever's calling the shots
paid her to get lost.

45:16.216 --> 45:19.386
You're gonna do great. I'll be
right there with you the whole time.

45:19.386 --> 45:21.680
And remember what the attorney said.
Ochoa won't be there,

45:21.680 --> 45:23.765
so you can answer the questions freely.

45:23.765 --> 45:26.059
- Okay, honey?
- Okay. Yeah.

45:26.059 --> 45:28.812
I'm sweating.
Does anyone have a hair band?

45:28.812 --> 45:30.397
- Or something?
- No, sorry.

45:30.397 --> 45:31.773
- Let me check.
- Thank you.

45:34.860 --> 45:35.861
Gosh.

45:40.240 --> 45:41.742
Maybe right here.

45:41.742 --> 45:44.077
- No, I don't think so.
- Nothing?

45:46.538 --> 45:47.623
Get down!

45:55.714 --> 45:57.424
Shots fired. Alameda Superior Courthouse.

45:57.424 --> 45:58.759
- We need backup now.
- Zarina!

45:58.759 --> 46:00.093
- We're okay.
- Are you okay?

46:00.093 --> 46:01.261
We're okay. Yeah.

46:01.261 --> 46:03.847
- You sure? All right.
- Oh, my God.

46:05.599 --> 46:07.017
- Oh, shit.
- Babe, pressure.

46:07.017 --> 46:08.185
Principal Pierre!

46:08.185 --> 46:09.978
Oh, my God. Eva.

46:09.978 --> 46:13.065
- Eva, can you hear me?
- Oh, my God.

46:13.607 --> 46:14.775
Anyone see the shooter?

46:14.775 --> 46:17.945
- Aames! She's been hit.
- Pressure, pressure.

46:18.654 --> 46:20.239
- Don't let go. Hard pressure.
- All right.

46:20.239 --> 46:21.698
- Eva?
- Baby, stay with us.

46:21.698 --> 46:23.075
Eva?
