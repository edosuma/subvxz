00:00.831 --> 00:02.221
Who is this guy?
What is he doing?

00:02.350 --> 00:05.038
He's watching, which is why we
refer to him as the observer.

00:05.197 --> 00:06.430
Previously on fringe...

00:06.534 --> 00:07.901
That's a different guy.

00:07.997 --> 00:09.405
Who are these people?

00:09.495 --> 00:13.678
I think these guys show up
at important moments.

00:14.773 --> 00:15.925
You were dead, Peter.

00:16.989 --> 00:19.646
We were drowning
and he dove in.

00:20.689 --> 00:23.305
We were saved, both of us,
by a man that I had never met.

00:23.372 --> 00:26.441
The boy is important.
He has to live.

00:26.509 --> 00:28.043
I have said too much.

00:28.110 --> 00:29.711
I'm not supposed
to get involved.

00:29.779 --> 00:32.347
It appears you've been busy.

00:32.415 --> 00:33.782
You have changed the future.

00:33.849 --> 00:37.319
You need to restore balance.
How?

00:37.386 --> 00:39.788
You will have an opportunity

00:39.855 --> 00:41.957
to fix this.

00:42.024 --> 00:44.759
Please don't take my son.

01:02.578 --> 01:04.078
Walter?

01:07.750 --> 01:09.251
Peter.

01:09.318 --> 01:10.752
You're up early.

01:10.820 --> 01:13.488
Oh, no, I'm still asleep
upstairs in my bed.

01:13.556 --> 01:15.657
You're just talking to
an astral projection of me.

01:15.725 --> 01:18.727
You're just saying that
to see if I'm high.

01:18.794 --> 01:20.161
What are you doing, Walter?

01:20.229 --> 01:23.181
I'm making myself smarter.

01:23.266 --> 01:25.500
Really?

01:25.568 --> 01:27.602
When William removed
those parts of my brain

01:27.670 --> 01:31.106
all those years ago,
he diminished my intellect.

01:31.173 --> 01:33.708
And now, I'm not
the equal of my equal.

01:33.776 --> 01:34.943
Your equal?

01:35.011 --> 01:38.146
Walternate.
If I can think like him,

01:38.214 --> 01:41.750
I can figure out what he's
trying to do with that device

01:41.817 --> 01:43.685
and how to keep you safe.

01:43.753 --> 01:44.853
Walter.
Hmm?

01:44.920 --> 01:46.688
You really sure you
should be dabbling in that?

01:46.756 --> 01:49.758
I've done hundreds of
experiments on myself.

01:49.825 --> 01:51.526
No. That's not
what I meant, Walter.

01:51.594 --> 01:53.662
According to William bell,

01:53.729 --> 01:55.797
he took out those parts
of your brain for a reason.

01:55.865 --> 01:58.600
Because you asked him to.

01:58.668 --> 02:01.636
Because you were afraid
of what you were becoming.

02:04.440 --> 02:07.142
I don't wanna see you
hurt yourself.

02:09.312 --> 02:11.946
I won't hurt myself.

02:14.650 --> 02:16.217
Who's that
at 2:00 in the morning?

02:16.285 --> 02:18.320
Oh! My pizza.

02:19.522 --> 02:21.423
<i>So you are high, then.</i>

02:21.490 --> 02:23.725
<i>Maybe a bit.</i>

02:33.135 --> 02:36.071
We've got a live one.

02:40.376 --> 02:43.812
<i>That's Mr. Joyce.
He's a sleepwalker.</i>

02:45.514 --> 02:48.583
<i>Open door in
the patient wing.</i>

02:51.053 --> 02:53.021
Who is that?

02:53.089 --> 02:54.522
Come on.

02:58.794 --> 03:00.061
Mr. Joyce.

03:02.031 --> 03:05.633
Are you awake?
Mr. Joyce.

03:05.701 --> 03:07.869
Who were you talking to?

03:07.937 --> 03:10.038
That boy.
Where did he go?

03:10.106 --> 03:12.741
I was talking to...

03:12.808 --> 03:15.610
Bobby.

03:15.678 --> 03:17.645
Bobby?

03:17.713 --> 03:20.915
Now, he definitely
wasn't talking to Bobby.

03:22.852 --> 03:24.436
Who's Bobby?

03:25.588 --> 03:28.623
It's Mr. Joyce's son.

03:28.691 --> 03:32.127
He died in 1985.

03:32.194 --> 03:34.562
What did he say to you?

03:45.107 --> 03:46.908
<i>Did you tell him?</i>

03:49.145 --> 03:50.245
What now?

03:50.312 --> 03:52.580
<i>I take you back home.</i>

04:22.277 --> 04:23.277
Olivia Dunham?

04:23.345 --> 04:24.662
Yeah.

04:30.018 --> 04:31.619
Thank you.

04:58.981 --> 05:01.182
Dunham.

05:09.624 --> 05:11.425
Hey.

05:11.493 --> 05:12.893
Hey.

05:14.496 --> 05:16.097
What's up?

05:16.164 --> 05:18.332
Broyles was just
telling us a ghost story.

05:18.383 --> 05:19.633
Bobby Joyce.

05:19.701 --> 05:21.102
He's the son of one
of the residents here.

05:21.169 --> 05:23.304
Or rather, he was.

05:23.372 --> 05:25.973
He died 25 years ago.

05:26.041 --> 05:27.508
And it gets more odd.

05:27.576 --> 05:29.577
The cameras picked up
this as well.

05:29.644 --> 05:32.013
<i>The observer?</i>

05:33.281 --> 05:35.850
It's been a while
since we've seen him.

05:35.917 --> 05:37.251
Agent Broyles?

05:43.358 --> 05:44.992
You comin', Walter?

05:46.928 --> 05:48.228
Yes, of course.

05:48.280 --> 05:49.764
After I took a
second look at the video,

05:49.831 --> 05:51.449
I knew who it was right away.

05:51.533 --> 05:54.368
Mr. Joyce keeps a photo
of Bobby on his bedside table.

05:54.436 --> 05:56.253
I been looking at it
ever since I worked here.

05:56.338 --> 05:57.638
Did Mr. Joyce say what it was

05:57.706 --> 05:59.840
that he and Bobby
were talking about?

05:59.908 --> 06:02.176
He doesn't remember.
He was sleepwalking.

06:02.244 --> 06:04.845
That's Mr. Joyce.

06:06.581 --> 06:08.783
Roscoe Joyce!

06:08.850 --> 06:09.850
You know him?

06:11.620 --> 06:13.471
Mr. Joyce!

06:13.555 --> 06:15.623
Mr...Mr. Joyce.

06:17.459 --> 06:19.960
I'm Walter bishop!

06:20.028 --> 06:22.096
I'm a tremendous fan!

06:23.832 --> 06:25.366
Nice to meet you.

06:25.434 --> 06:28.169
You ever heard of
Violet sedan chair? No.

06:28.236 --> 06:30.071
It's Walter's favorite band.

06:30.138 --> 06:31.439
Roscoe Joyce
is their keyboardist.

06:31.506 --> 06:32.940
He's a hero of Walter's.

06:33.008 --> 06:34.842
He's up there
with Einstein and tesla.

06:34.910 --> 06:37.878
Uh...Mr. Joyce,

06:37.946 --> 06:39.747
I'm agent Olivia Dunham.

06:39.815 --> 06:42.683
Hi.

06:42.751 --> 06:45.019
I understand that you
had a visitor last night.

06:45.087 --> 06:47.455
My son.

06:49.424 --> 06:51.826
I don't remember
talking to him.

06:51.893 --> 06:55.796
But I remember he was here.

06:55.864 --> 06:58.065
It's a curse, not...

06:58.133 --> 07:02.603
Remembering a miracle.

07:02.671 --> 07:05.973
It was a miracle
seeing him again.

07:08.343 --> 07:10.945
Can you imagine
what that's like?

07:11.012 --> 07:13.581
Yes, I can.

07:21.923 --> 07:23.257
Mr. Joyce?

07:23.325 --> 07:24.291
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

07:24.359 --> 07:25.826
It's time for his
physical therapy

07:25.894 --> 07:27.695
and his medication.

07:29.698 --> 07:31.732
Ready, Mr. Joyce?

07:31.800 --> 07:33.467
One, two...

07:33.535 --> 07:35.136
<i>Three.</i>

07:38.540 --> 07:40.975
I've come to believe
in some strange things,

07:41.042 --> 07:42.409
but ghosts...

07:42.477 --> 07:44.311
Bobby wasn't a ghost.

07:44.379 --> 07:47.364
The observer doesn't
experience time like we do.

07:47.449 --> 07:49.917
<i>If we can accept that he can
travel from the past</i>

07:49.985 --> 07:51.819
to the present
and back to the past again,

07:51.887 --> 07:53.254
then it's not inconceivable

07:53.321 --> 07:55.990
that he could bring
others with him.

07:56.057 --> 07:57.858
We'll have to try
and help Mr. Joyce

07:57.926 --> 08:00.661
remember what his son
said to him.

08:00.729 --> 08:03.330
I'll need to take him
back to my lab.

08:03.398 --> 08:04.932
But why would the observer
drag a dead man

08:05.000 --> 08:06.767
25 years through time
just to talk with his father?

08:06.835 --> 08:08.502
<i>I don't know.</i>

08:08.570 --> 08:10.271
But every time
the observer shows up,

08:10.338 --> 08:12.973
it has something to do
with you.

08:13.041 --> 08:15.676
And every time,
it's something bad.

08:15.744 --> 08:17.411
Walter, come on, you...

08:17.479 --> 08:19.180
I'll go wait in the car.

08:24.119 --> 08:27.855
I'll make the arrangements
to have Mr. Joyce released.

08:27.906 --> 08:29.690
Three pills
at 8:00 this evening,

08:29.758 --> 08:31.959
and he gets a little cranky
if he doesn't eat.

08:32.027 --> 08:33.294
That's all right.

08:33.361 --> 08:34.695
I got experience with cranky.

08:34.746 --> 08:36.764
Thank you.
Mm-hmm. Have a good one.

08:40.202 --> 08:42.135
That's sweet.

08:42.203 --> 08:45.339
<i>Yeah, it is.</i>

08:52.981 --> 08:55.950
Uh, I don't think
that this was for me.

08:56.017 --> 08:57.718
It arrived this morning,

08:57.786 --> 08:59.853
and I looked at the date
on the order,

08:59.921 --> 09:02.156
and it was from when
I was over there.

09:02.224 --> 09:04.325
So I figured that it was
probably for her.

09:04.392 --> 09:05.626
Olivia...

09:05.694 --> 09:08.596
it's okay.

09:17.239 --> 09:20.040
I understand
you're gonna help me

09:20.108 --> 09:22.910
remember what
my son said to me.

09:22.978 --> 09:24.778
We're gonna try.

09:40.629 --> 09:44.298
I'm almost done here.
You guys finished out front?

10:14.996 --> 10:18.966
I'm at 719 Skelton Avenue.
There has been a robbery.

10:37.752 --> 10:38.786
Help me.

11:01.092 --> 11:02.643
Thank you.

11:15.047 --> 11:17.481
Walter?
Where do you want this?

11:17.549 --> 11:21.419
Uh, r-r-right...There!

11:21.486 --> 11:23.020
Very good.
Thanks, fellas.

11:25.891 --> 11:28.042
What's he listening to?
Ocean waves.

11:28.110 --> 11:30.628
I need him to be
in a peaceful state of mind

11:30.696 --> 11:32.663
for the hypnotherapy
to take full effect.

11:32.731 --> 11:34.198
<i>Once he's in a more
pliable state,</i>

11:34.266 --> 11:36.801
<i>he may be able to access
his memories.</i>

11:36.868 --> 11:39.737
That's a good look, Walter.

11:39.805 --> 11:41.839
These were created
by an old friend of mine,

11:41.907 --> 11:44.659
Dr. Jacoby
from Washington state.

11:44.743 --> 11:47.511
They will enable me
to see Roscoe's aura

11:47.579 --> 11:51.782
so that I can measure
the depth of his hypnotic state.

11:51.850 --> 11:53.317
And the piano?

11:53.385 --> 11:57.421
Roscoe's mind
doesn't work like ours.

11:57.489 --> 12:00.725
<i>His creativity
is expressed through music.</i>

12:00.792 --> 12:03.311
Playing may help him
to recollect the conversation

12:03.395 --> 12:04.795
he had with his son.

12:04.863 --> 12:06.764
And if you just happen
to get a private concert

12:06.832 --> 12:08.766
from your musical idol...

12:08.834 --> 12:10.518
That's not why I'm doing this.

12:10.602 --> 12:13.771
But I cannot deny
that I would enjoy it.

12:16.441 --> 12:18.075
Mr. Joyce?

12:19.878 --> 12:21.712
We're ready for you.

12:21.780 --> 12:24.248
What do you want me to do?

12:24.316 --> 12:26.450
Let me guide you.

12:26.518 --> 12:28.719
Listen to my voice.

12:28.787 --> 12:31.455
I will speak
into the microphone.

12:33.992 --> 12:37.194
Now, imagine yourself...
Somewhere tranquil,

12:37.262 --> 12:41.399
serene, safe.

12:41.466 --> 12:44.602
<i>Go down the staircase...</i>

12:44.669 --> 12:47.471
<i>So there's no footage
at all?</i>

12:47.539 --> 12:49.473
Okay, well,
thank you for checking.

12:51.176 --> 12:52.410
I thought maybe
the traffic cameras

12:52.477 --> 12:53.911
would have picked up
the observer,

12:53.979 --> 12:56.113
but no such luck.

12:56.181 --> 12:57.848
How's it going out there?

12:57.916 --> 13:01.552
Uh, Walter's channeling
the amazing Kreskin.

13:05.057 --> 13:07.024
I just wanted to try
and explain the book.

13:07.092 --> 13:09.860
You don't have to.

13:09.928 --> 13:12.730
She asked me what
my favorite book was.

13:12.798 --> 13:14.665
I understand that she was
probably just trying

13:14.733 --> 13:16.367
to gather information
on me, but...

13:16.435 --> 13:21.272
I also know that I'm not
the easiest guy to get to know.

13:21.340 --> 13:25.009
It's always been easier
for me to...

13:25.077 --> 13:27.445
Keep people at arm's length...

13:27.512 --> 13:31.248
Which is actually something
that I think we have in common.

13:35.153 --> 13:38.356
The book wasn't meant for her.

13:38.423 --> 13:40.057
It was meant for
the Olivia Dunham

13:40.125 --> 13:43.561
that I've spent the last
couple years of my life with.

13:46.198 --> 13:47.898
Because I wanted you
to read it.

13:47.966 --> 13:52.203
You're the person
I wanted to share it with.

13:55.173 --> 13:58.075
You know, I feel like
rip van winkle.

14:00.645 --> 14:04.682
Everything is different.

14:04.750 --> 14:08.853
Even you opening up to me
is different.

14:08.920 --> 14:10.855
And this book
is just a reminder

14:10.922 --> 14:14.859
of all the things
that I missed,

14:14.926 --> 14:17.228
conversations we didn't have...

14:18.397 --> 14:19.830
<i>You guys should come
see this.</i>

14:19.898 --> 14:23.167
Walter's doing it.

14:31.476 --> 14:32.943
Sit.

14:37.833 --> 14:39.950
At the count of three,

14:40.018 --> 14:43.087
you will open your eyes,
but you won't be awake.

14:43.155 --> 14:46.957
You'll still be open
and receptive as you are now.

14:47.025 --> 14:49.693
Are you ready?

14:49.761 --> 14:51.729
One...

14:51.797 --> 14:53.764
Two, three.

15:00.071 --> 15:04.275
It's been a long time
since I touched a piano.

15:37.275 --> 15:40.010
Roscoe, I want you
to think back.

15:42.481 --> 15:45.549
The night you saw Bobby.

15:45.617 --> 15:47.418
Tuesday...

15:47.486 --> 15:50.688
Tuesday is...

15:50.755 --> 15:52.723
Chicken dinner.

15:52.791 --> 15:55.759
Yes. And...

15:55.827 --> 15:57.661
After you went to bed
and fell asleep,

15:57.729 --> 15:58.896
what happened?

16:01.099 --> 16:03.334
Bobby...

16:03.401 --> 16:05.736
My boy.

16:05.804 --> 16:09.940
I didn't believe it was him.

16:10.008 --> 16:12.943
It'd been so long since...

16:13.011 --> 16:14.411
I'd seen him.

16:17.015 --> 16:19.917
I asked him if he was real.

16:23.855 --> 16:28.592
He took my hand...

16:28.660 --> 16:33.464
He was real.

16:33.532 --> 16:36.033
What did he say?

16:36.101 --> 16:39.770
He whispered something to me.

16:39.838 --> 16:43.674
He was so close...

16:43.742 --> 16:45.709
I felt his...

16:45.777 --> 16:47.011
God, I-I-I'm...

16:47.078 --> 16:49.146
Dunham.
Can you hold on, please?

16:49.214 --> 16:50.981
I-I'm so sorry, Walter.

16:51.049 --> 16:53.150
<i>This is Dunham.
Let's go.</i>

16:53.218 --> 16:56.153
What did Bobby say?

16:58.156 --> 16:59.557
I don't remember.

16:59.624 --> 17:02.026
<i>Go it. I'm on my way.</i>

17:02.093 --> 17:04.395
The observer's been spotted
in Brookline, so...

17:07.198 --> 17:08.832
Walter, you all right?

17:08.900 --> 17:10.501
If all right means
despondent, yes.

17:10.569 --> 17:12.636
Peter, go.
I'll take care of him.

17:13.637 --> 17:15.906
Walter, I'm sorry!

17:20.211 --> 17:22.680
He was in a...

17:22.747 --> 17:25.082
Brown shirt.

17:25.150 --> 17:26.884
Who was?

17:26.952 --> 17:28.919
Bobby.

17:28.987 --> 17:33.257
His mother gave it to him.

17:34.659 --> 17:38.495
What did Bobby tell you?

17:40.098 --> 17:42.866
He told me...

17:42.934 --> 17:45.769
I would...Meet you.

17:45.837 --> 17:49.607
Walter...Bishop.

17:49.674 --> 17:53.210
He called you by name.

17:53.278 --> 17:57.715
Bobby said I was
supposed to...Help you.

17:57.782 --> 17:59.750
Help me.

17:59.818 --> 18:01.018
How?

18:01.086 --> 18:03.687
I don't know.

18:09.127 --> 18:11.095
Don't you?

18:28.274 --> 18:30.275
It has begun.

18:30.342 --> 18:32.310
I have set everything
in motion.

18:32.361 --> 18:35.280
I have watched Dr. bishop
as long as you have,

18:35.348 --> 18:38.717
perhaps not as closely,
but I think you're wrong.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.352
He won't do it.

18:40.419 --> 18:42.320
I disagree.

18:42.388 --> 18:45.323
I believe he has changed.

18:49.562 --> 18:52.530
You think he has changed.

18:52.598 --> 18:54.532
I don't believe he has.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.234
In either case,

18:56.302 --> 18:58.570
I suppose we will find out
soon enough.

19:25.498 --> 19:29.100
Are you sure you don't know
what I'm supposed to do for ya?

19:29.168 --> 19:30.568
No idea.

19:30.636 --> 19:32.804
Bobby told me to help you.

19:32.872 --> 19:35.040
You already have.

19:35.107 --> 19:37.876
Just hearing you play, I...

19:37.944 --> 19:39.411
<i>I feel like
I'm a teenager again.</i>

19:45.935 --> 19:47.185
Can I ask you something,
Roscoe?

19:48.587 --> 19:52.223
Why did Violet sedan chair
break up?

19:52.291 --> 19:55.627
I don't know.
It just happened.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.696
We were having
creative differences.

19:57.763 --> 20:01.066
We figured the best thing to do
was to take a break,

20:01.133 --> 20:04.035
give the band time to regroup.

20:04.103 --> 20:07.305
One day, I looked up...

20:07.373 --> 20:10.675
And a couple of years
had gone by.

20:10.743 --> 20:14.079
I barely touched the keyboard.

20:14.146 --> 20:15.880
And then a couple more.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.716
Eventually...

20:17.783 --> 20:20.085
It just seemed easier not to.

20:22.888 --> 20:25.223
I suppose that
that's hard to understand.

20:25.291 --> 20:27.692
No.

20:27.760 --> 20:32.130
I spent years away
from the things I loved.

20:32.198 --> 20:34.432
I've been trying to get
back into the swing of it

20:34.500 --> 20:37.268
ever since.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.674
<i>I was having
an asthma attack.</i>

20:42.742 --> 20:44.743
It was like
he saw what I needed.

20:44.810 --> 20:47.512
He got my inhaler
from my purse.

20:47.580 --> 20:50.782
Did he say anything to you?

20:50.850 --> 20:52.283
No. Nothing.

20:52.351 --> 20:54.753
It was like nothing
affected him.

20:54.820 --> 20:59.057
He had this calmness.

20:59.125 --> 21:03.228
I didn't even think
he was real, except...

21:03.295 --> 21:05.130
He saved my life.

21:08.934 --> 21:15.673
So...What... what is all this
you got here, huh?

21:15.741 --> 21:19.077
Recently,
I invented a liquid base

21:19.145 --> 21:22.280
to aid in the process
of brain-mapping.

21:23.549 --> 21:24.949
Ha. Really?

21:25.017 --> 21:27.285
Brain-mapping.

21:27.353 --> 21:29.154
<i>That's a good name
for an album.</i>

21:29.221 --> 21:30.872
<i>Any chance you could
explain that</i>

21:30.956 --> 21:34.325
<i>to a simpleton like me?</i>

21:34.393 --> 21:37.462
I don't want to bore you
with the details,

21:37.530 --> 21:39.998
but I'm missing
parts of my brain.

21:40.066 --> 21:42.600
And I have to rejuvenate them

21:42.668 --> 21:44.402
in order to rise

21:44.470 --> 21:47.238
to the intellectual
challenges before me.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.506
And they are?

21:48.574 --> 21:50.508
Discovering why your son Bobby

21:50.576 --> 21:52.243
left the message...

21:52.311 --> 21:54.345
And how to keep my son Peter

21:54.413 --> 21:56.314
from the peril surrounding him.

21:56.382 --> 21:59.751
Is that...Milk?

21:59.819 --> 22:01.453
The milk acts
as a bonding agent

22:01.520 --> 22:02.854
for the other compounds.

22:05.091 --> 22:08.626
A-and helps disguise
the taste.

22:08.694 --> 22:11.963
I don't see how I can

22:12.031 --> 22:14.466
help you in any way.

22:14.533 --> 22:17.669
My knowledge of science
begins and ends

22:17.736 --> 22:20.371
with inventing
a recipe for a...

22:20.439 --> 22:23.975
<i>Strawberry milk shake.</i>

22:24.043 --> 22:25.977
You like strawberry milk shake?

22:26.045 --> 22:29.514
They're my number one drink
since I stopped drinking.

22:29.582 --> 22:31.549
It's mine too!

22:31.617 --> 22:34.052
Ashram!
Come out here, please.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.653
Walter, what is it?

22:35.721 --> 22:38.456
<i>I need you to go to the grocery store.
Walter...</i>

22:38.524 --> 22:40.792
We need a gallon
of strawberry ice cream,

22:40.860 --> 22:43.628
<i>some sweet whey,
and some yeast and some sugar.</i>

22:43.696 --> 22:46.297
Okay.
We need coffee anyway.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.899
Thank you, dear.

22:49.601 --> 22:52.871
I spent six years
perfecting my recipe.

22:52.938 --> 22:54.506
<i>You must try it!</i>

22:54.573 --> 22:56.608
Well...Ha.

22:56.675 --> 22:58.676
To answers.

22:58.744 --> 23:00.678
Oh, did you forget something?

23:00.746 --> 23:04.749
I hope they didn't
run out of sweet whey.

23:06.118 --> 23:08.553
Hello, Walter.

23:08.621 --> 23:10.388
We need to speak.

23:18.384 --> 23:21.119
You call it...
Autumn.

23:21.187 --> 23:23.321
Is that right?

23:23.372 --> 23:25.990
Lovely word.

23:26.042 --> 23:28.293
We had a deal.

23:28.361 --> 23:31.830
Please...
Don't take him from me.

23:33.966 --> 23:37.402
The drawing.
Peter in the device.

23:37.470 --> 23:40.238
You know the future.

23:40.306 --> 23:43.542
Tell me how I can
save my son from dying.

23:43.609 --> 23:47.012
There are things that I know.

23:47.079 --> 23:49.114
But there are things
that I do not.

23:49.182 --> 23:53.485
Various possible futures
are happening simultaneously.

23:53.553 --> 23:57.355
I can tell you all of them,
but I cannot tell you

23:57.423 --> 24:00.392
which one of them
will come to pass.

24:00.459 --> 24:04.162
Because every action
causes ripples,

24:04.230 --> 24:09.501
consequences both obvious
and...Unforeseen.

24:12.004 --> 24:14.439
For instance...

24:14.507 --> 24:18.426
After I pulled you
and Peter from the icy lake,

24:18.511 --> 24:23.949
later that summer,
Peter caught a firefly.

24:24.016 --> 24:26.818
I could not have known
he would do that

24:26.886 --> 24:29.354
or that because he did

24:29.422 --> 24:33.191
a young girl three Miles
away would not.

24:33.259 --> 24:34.776
<i>And so later that night,</i>

24:34.861 --> 24:37.863
she would continue looking,

24:37.930 --> 24:41.666
trying to find another one.

24:41.734 --> 24:44.302
I could not have known that
when she did not come home,

24:44.370 --> 24:46.371
her father would go out
looking for her,

24:46.439 --> 24:49.074
driving in the rain,

24:49.141 --> 24:51.476
so that when the traffic
light turned red,

24:51.544 --> 24:55.213
his truck skidded through the
intersection at Harvard yard,

24:55.281 --> 24:57.132
killing a pedestrian.

24:57.216 --> 24:59.684
Did that happen?

24:59.752 --> 25:02.354
You and I have interfered

25:02.421 --> 25:05.423
with the natural course
of events.

25:05.491 --> 25:09.027
We have upset the balance

25:09.095 --> 25:11.696
in ways I could not
have predicted.

25:13.900 --> 25:17.903
Which is why
now I need your help.

25:20.506 --> 25:22.774
Help?

25:22.825 --> 25:24.476
When the time comes,

25:24.543 --> 25:27.345
give him the keys
and save the girl.

25:27.413 --> 25:29.180
Give him the keys?
W-wha... what do you mean?

25:29.248 --> 25:30.515
What girl?

25:30.583 --> 25:32.584
You should answer your phone.

25:40.459 --> 25:42.127
Hello?

25:42.194 --> 25:44.129
<i>Apparently, your friend
is fighting crimes now.</i>

25:44.196 --> 25:47.265
<i>Friend?
The observer.</i>

25:47.333 --> 25:49.200
<i>Broke up a robbery
at a jewelry store.</i>

25:49.268 --> 25:50.535
Three guys came in,
killed the owner,

25:50.603 --> 25:51.736
tied up the girl
who worked here.

25:51.804 --> 25:53.939
<i>Girl?
Yeah, according to her,</i>

25:54.006 --> 25:55.473
<i>the observer
saved her life.</i>

25:55.541 --> 25:58.743
<i>Who is she, the girl?
Her name's Victoria Dimiro.</i>

25:58.811 --> 26:00.428
Why?

26:00.496 --> 26:03.081
I-I-I need to speak to her.
Bring her here.

26:03.149 --> 26:05.050
<i>Walter... please don't
argue with me, Peter.</i>

26:05.117 --> 26:06.084
<i>This is important.</i>

26:06.152 --> 26:08.186
I need to speak with her.

26:08.254 --> 26:09.988
Fine.
But you'll have to wait.

26:10.056 --> 26:11.122
Cops are about to
take her downtown

26:11.190 --> 26:12.457
so she can give a statement.

26:12.525 --> 26:13.925
Well, as soon as they're done,

26:13.993 --> 26:15.994
bring her here to me.

26:26.806 --> 26:30.041
Ah! There you are.

26:30.109 --> 26:32.911
I have several things
to tell you.

26:32.979 --> 26:35.113
First...

26:35.181 --> 26:39.084
Miss Farnsworth is back.

26:40.453 --> 26:42.587
And, uh, and I...

26:42.655 --> 26:46.391
Remember something else.

26:48.127 --> 26:51.229
Bobby...Called me
on the phone.

26:51.297 --> 26:53.264
Just now?

26:53.332 --> 26:55.100
Oh, no, no. Ha ha.

26:55.167 --> 26:56.634
No.

26:56.702 --> 26:59.304
Years ago.

27:02.141 --> 27:04.309
We were on tour,

27:04.377 --> 27:07.946
and he called to tell me

27:08.014 --> 27:10.281
about a strange dream
he'd just had.

27:10.349 --> 27:13.518
He dreamt a bald man

27:13.586 --> 27:16.388
in a dark suit

27:16.455 --> 27:18.990
took him to see me.

27:19.058 --> 27:23.061
I was an old man
living in a nursing home.

27:25.197 --> 27:29.868
Dreamin' about
something that happens...

27:29.935 --> 27:33.838
25 years later.

27:33.906 --> 27:37.776
I don't think
it was a dream at all.

27:37.843 --> 27:43.548
I think...The man in the suit
took your son through time.

27:43.616 --> 27:46.184
And it was only just last night

27:46.252 --> 27:48.686
that you caught up
to the other end of the visit.

27:52.358 --> 27:53.358
Wild.

27:55.694 --> 27:58.329
You know, come to think of it,

27:58.397 --> 28:03.501
that was the last
conversation we had.

28:03.569 --> 28:07.005
Him...Telling me
about his dream.

28:09.141 --> 28:11.409
We were playing

28:11.477 --> 28:13.511
a show that night,

28:13.579 --> 28:17.615
a club in Harvard yard.

28:17.683 --> 28:21.352
Bobby...

28:21.420 --> 28:24.355
Was on his way to the show.

28:24.423 --> 28:26.191
I remember looking outside

28:26.258 --> 28:30.728
and seeing how hard
it was raining.

28:30.796 --> 28:33.932
I remember getting
a call from the police.

28:36.535 --> 28:38.036
They told me...

28:38.104 --> 28:40.939
He stepped onto
the crosswalk...

28:44.743 --> 28:45.677
When a truck...

28:45.744 --> 28:48.680
skidded through
the traffic light.

28:56.856 --> 29:00.325
<i>They said it was...
wasn't anybody's fault.</i>

29:05.397 --> 29:09.167
When I lost my son...

29:09.235 --> 29:12.737
Nothing seemed to
matter anymore.

29:16.942 --> 29:20.879
That's the reason
I broke up the band.

29:32.024 --> 29:35.293
But here I am.

29:35.361 --> 29:37.996
I played again.
It felt good.

29:38.063 --> 29:40.031
It felt right.

29:42.935 --> 29:45.737
Maybe that's why
Bobby came back.

29:48.140 --> 29:50.275
Maybe it was.

29:52.711 --> 29:55.680
Would you excuse me
for a moment?

30:00.452 --> 30:02.387
Hey.
Peter called.

30:02.454 --> 30:04.422
He wanted me to let you know

30:04.490 --> 30:05.723
that they are
on their way back,

30:05.791 --> 30:08.560
and they're bringing
the salesgirl with them.

30:08.627 --> 30:09.961
Walter, what is it?

30:10.029 --> 30:12.564
I know what
the observer's doing.

30:12.631 --> 30:14.666
Okay.

30:14.733 --> 30:16.768
The day I crossed over
and saved Peter,

30:16.835 --> 30:19.571
I set off a chain reaction.

30:19.638 --> 30:22.140
I set the universe
off-balance.

30:22.208 --> 30:24.509
Two of them.

30:24.577 --> 30:27.145
I've seen the damage
with my own eyes, but...

30:27.213 --> 30:28.746
It's not enough.

30:28.814 --> 30:31.115
It... it's not enough
to understand

30:31.183 --> 30:32.550
the suffering I've caused.

30:32.618 --> 30:34.052
Walter, we have been over this.

30:34.119 --> 30:35.620
You couldn't have known.

30:35.688 --> 30:37.822
That's exactly the point...
unforeseen consequences.

30:37.890 --> 30:40.358
But my fault, just the same.

30:43.562 --> 30:44.729
And that man...

30:44.797 --> 30:47.165
Has lost a son

30:47.233 --> 30:49.367
because I was
unwilling to lose mine.

30:52.905 --> 30:56.007
I know the observer
is trying to restore balance,

30:56.075 --> 30:58.243
and he wants me to help him,

30:58.310 --> 31:01.179
to... to help undo
all the damage I've caused,

31:01.247 --> 31:02.513
but I can't do it.

31:02.581 --> 31:03.881
Don't you see?
Doing that,

31:03.949 --> 31:05.950
I would lose him
all over again.

31:06.018 --> 31:07.919
Lose who?
Peter!

31:07.987 --> 31:09.187
Walter...

31:09.255 --> 31:11.489
I need a phone!

31:18.297 --> 31:19.564
Hello.

31:19.631 --> 31:22.033
<i>A-ask that salesgirl
a question for me.</i>

31:22.101 --> 31:24.602
Where was she in 1985?

31:24.653 --> 31:26.871
I can't do that, Walter.
She's in the car in front of us.

31:26.939 --> 31:28.406
But we're just passing
through Porter square.

31:28.474 --> 31:29.941
We should be there
in about five minutes.

31:30.009 --> 31:31.576
You can ask her all
the questions you like then...

31:35.681 --> 31:37.649
Peter?

31:48.167 --> 31:49.667
Peter?

31:49.735 --> 31:51.803
<i>Peter, what is it?</i>

31:51.870 --> 31:53.405
You check the other car.
I'll go after him.

31:53.472 --> 31:54.973
<i>Peter, what's happening?</i>

31:55.040 --> 31:56.841
<i>The observer
ran into the cop car.</i>

31:56.909 --> 31:58.576
Peter, are you all right?

31:58.644 --> 32:01.012
Get on the dispatch.
We're gonna need an ambulance.

32:01.080 --> 32:03.081
<i>Peter! I gotta go!
I gotta go!</i>

32:03.149 --> 32:04.749
Where's your, uh, your inhaler?

32:07.353 --> 32:08.820
No. It's not in there.

32:08.888 --> 32:10.955
The bald man in the store...

32:11.023 --> 32:12.290
He took it.

32:12.358 --> 32:15.360
Put your arms around my neck.

32:16.929 --> 32:18.096
Excuse me!

32:18.164 --> 32:19.898
FBI! Move!

32:21.367 --> 32:22.934
Try to calm down.
You're gonna be all right.

32:26.338 --> 32:27.539
Peter, are you okay?

32:27.606 --> 32:29.374
Yeah, I'm fine, but she's not.

32:29.442 --> 32:31.376
<i>What's wrong with her?</i>

32:31.444 --> 32:33.344
She's asthmatic.
The adrenaline from the crash...

32:33.412 --> 32:35.013
elevated her heart rate
and triggered an attack.

32:35.080 --> 32:36.514
Exactly. There's an ambulance
on the way, okay?

32:36.582 --> 32:37.649
Where are you going?

32:37.716 --> 32:38.983
Olivia took off
after the observer on foot.

32:39.051 --> 32:40.635
I'm gonna catch up.

32:40.719 --> 32:42.053
<i>Hey, gimme the keys, and save the girl.
What did you say?</i>

32:42.121 --> 32:45.156
I said gimme the keys
and save the girl.

32:45.224 --> 32:47.058
He told me you'd say that.
Who?

32:47.126 --> 32:48.943
The observer.

32:49.028 --> 32:50.995
This is it!
This is his plan.

32:51.063 --> 32:52.363
This is what he wanted.

32:52.431 --> 32:53.898
You spoke with the observer?

32:53.966 --> 32:55.283
Yes! He is
course correcting.

32:55.367 --> 32:57.202
I don't know how,
but he's done some kind of...

32:57.269 --> 32:58.803
A chain reaction that started
from the moment

32:58.871 --> 33:01.139
that we walked into that
nursing home to meet Roscoe.

33:01.207 --> 33:03.174
Everything since has been
the sequence

33:03.242 --> 33:04.876
culminating
in this very moment,

33:04.944 --> 33:07.011
and if I save this woman
and let you go,

33:07.079 --> 33:09.447
then I'm afraid
the consequences...

33:09.515 --> 33:10.665
You're gonna die, Peter.

33:10.749 --> 33:12.217
They're gonna take you from me.

33:12.284 --> 33:14.252
Walter, you can't predict
the future, and neither can I.

33:14.320 --> 33:15.820
But if you don't help
that girl right now,

33:15.888 --> 33:17.755
she's gonna die
in the street... do you hear me?

33:17.823 --> 33:19.190
They'll take you from me.

33:19.258 --> 33:22.527
Walter, give me the keys.

33:22.595 --> 33:24.295
Give me the keys, Walter.

33:31.337 --> 33:32.937
Excuse me!
Out of my way! Move!

33:33.005 --> 33:35.240
FBI!

33:35.307 --> 33:36.991
Coming through!
Excuse me!

33:46.452 --> 33:47.886
<i>Yeah.
I'm on state street.</i>

33:47.953 --> 33:49.220
I've lost him.

33:49.288 --> 33:50.755
<i>I got him.</i>

33:50.823 --> 33:54.058
He's headed into a hostel
at 119 main street.

33:54.126 --> 33:56.794
<i>Okay. I'm on my way.</i>

34:03.102 --> 34:04.469
Hey!

34:13.612 --> 34:15.647
<i>Walter, she's getting worse!</i>

34:20.853 --> 34:23.420
Now, here, I-I want you
to lay down, please,

34:23.489 --> 34:25.456
so we can help you...
lay down.

34:25.524 --> 34:26.591
Astrid, would you
put your hands

34:26.659 --> 34:27.708
either side
of her ribs, please?

34:27.793 --> 34:29.327
It's all right.

34:29.395 --> 34:30.628
When I tell you,

34:30.696 --> 34:32.996
I want you to push up,
applying constant pressure.

34:33.047 --> 34:34.165
Okay.

34:34.216 --> 34:35.934
I am going to use
this plastic bottle

34:36.001 --> 34:37.969
to push air into your lungs.

34:38.036 --> 34:41.139
Will you hold your nose,
please?

34:41.206 --> 34:43.408
Okay, good.
Are you ready? Push.

34:53.185 --> 34:55.937
<i>What is this all about?</i>

34:56.021 --> 34:58.022
<i>You know, don't you?</i>

35:00.192 --> 35:02.026
The picture of me
and the device...

35:02.094 --> 35:03.995
what does it mean?

35:05.431 --> 35:07.498
What's gonna happen to me?

35:11.870 --> 35:13.838
It must be very difficult.

35:13.906 --> 35:15.640
What?

35:15.708 --> 35:19.577
Being a father.

35:38.464 --> 35:40.097
Hey!

36:01.487 --> 36:03.988
You need to keep her calm
to prevent another attack.

36:04.056 --> 36:06.391
Thank you.

36:10.863 --> 36:13.014
H-hello?

36:13.098 --> 36:15.533
<i>Walter, we lost him.</i>

36:15.601 --> 36:17.502
Peter?

36:17.569 --> 36:19.003
<i>No, Walter, the observer.
Peter's fine.</i>

36:19.071 --> 36:21.039
<i>He's just a bit
banged up, that's all.</i>

36:21.106 --> 36:23.307
Why would you think
we lost Peter?

36:25.678 --> 36:27.145
Is Peter okay?

36:29.748 --> 36:31.816
Yes.

36:31.884 --> 36:35.219
It doesn't make sense.

36:35.287 --> 36:38.856
Why would the observer
do all this?

36:47.421 --> 36:49.589
Home.

36:51.158 --> 36:54.794
It was a pleasure
to meet you, Kelly.

36:54.862 --> 36:57.063
You too, Roscoe.

36:59.433 --> 37:01.401
I don't know what to say.

37:01.468 --> 37:04.971
Come visit me sometime.

37:05.039 --> 37:08.474
Bring me
a strawberry milk shake.

37:08.542 --> 37:10.443
I'll play some piano for ya.

37:10.511 --> 37:13.046
It would be an honor.

37:23.757 --> 37:26.559
I forgot what my son felt like,

37:26.627 --> 37:29.796
what he smelled like.

37:29.863 --> 37:34.300
How it felt to be around him.

37:34.368 --> 37:36.669
But now I remember.

37:38.839 --> 37:42.442
Nobody is supposed to have
a second chance like that.

37:47.981 --> 37:50.400
First he saves the girl,
then he tries to kill her.

37:50.484 --> 37:52.852
Then he runs up
five flights of stairs

37:52.920 --> 37:55.688
just to shoot me with his
magic air gun and disappear.

37:55.756 --> 37:57.323
None of it makes any sense.

37:57.391 --> 38:01.461
And how is this different
to any other day?

38:02.930 --> 38:05.264
Peter, are you sure
you don't wanna go see a doctor?

38:05.332 --> 38:08.067
No, I'm okay.
Thanks.

38:21.047 --> 38:22.615
<i>You ever feel like</i>

38:22.683 --> 38:24.917
every time we get close
to getting the answers,

38:24.985 --> 38:26.853
somebody changes the question?

38:31.158 --> 38:32.425
Olivia.

38:37.831 --> 38:40.566
So why is this
your favorite book?

38:43.470 --> 38:44.737
Because it talks about

38:44.805 --> 38:48.174
not depending on other
people for answers.

38:48.242 --> 38:51.944
That you can only find
the answers inside yourself.

38:52.012 --> 38:53.679
Which...

38:53.747 --> 38:55.114
Given our current situation,

38:55.182 --> 38:57.750
is kind of amusing
if you think about it.

39:05.893 --> 39:07.360
Peter? Peter!

39:11.098 --> 39:13.166
Hello. Walter bishop.

39:13.233 --> 39:14.567
<i>Walter, Peter's collapsed.</i>

39:14.635 --> 39:16.102
He's having
some kind of a seizure.

39:16.170 --> 39:18.437
He took some aspirins and
swallowed it with some milk...

39:18.489 --> 39:20.606
<i>milk?
Yeah, from the refrigerator.</i>

39:20.657 --> 39:22.575
Oh, God!
Oh, God what?

39:22.643 --> 39:24.944
<i>The organometals
I-in the serum</i>

39:25.012 --> 39:27.513
must have reacted w-with
the phosphates in the milk.

39:27.581 --> 39:28.915
Walter, what do I do?

39:28.982 --> 39:31.350
<i>He needs an anticoagulant
to stop the seizures.</i>

39:31.418 --> 39:34.320
<i>In my medical bag on the shelf
near the centrifuge.</i>

39:34.388 --> 39:36.022
<i>Okay, I got it...
you'll also need</i>

39:36.089 --> 39:38.891
<i>the gallon jug of saline,
which is on the bottom shelf.</i>

39:38.959 --> 39:41.894
Open the bag... you'll find
a bottle of magnesium sulfate.

39:41.962 --> 39:43.029
<i>Use the syringe.</i>

39:43.096 --> 39:45.364
<i>1 cc of magnesium sulfate,</i>

39:45.432 --> 39:48.167
<i>9 ccs o-of saline.</i>

39:48.235 --> 39:49.702
<i>It's not here, Walter,
the magnesium sulfate.</i>

39:49.770 --> 39:51.020
<i>I can't find it.</i>

39:51.104 --> 39:53.539
Oh, w... no, no, no,
I moved it, so...

39:53.607 --> 39:55.157
So I-I'd know where
I put it.

39:55.242 --> 39:57.376
<i>It was such
an obvious place...</i>

39:57.444 --> 39:58.611
<i>please, Walter!</i>

39:58.679 --> 39:59.612
Oh! Yeah!

39:59.680 --> 40:01.047
I-I alphabetized it.

40:01.114 --> 40:03.049
<i>I-it's in the refrigerator</i>

40:03.116 --> 40:05.685
next to the mayonnaise.

40:05.752 --> 40:07.520
Okay. I got it.

40:07.588 --> 40:09.355
<i>Quickly...</i>

40:12.960 --> 40:14.961
okay, Walter.
Where do I put it?

40:15.028 --> 40:17.129
In his leg.
In his right leg.

40:26.340 --> 40:28.357
Olivia?

40:28.442 --> 40:31.577
<i>Please tell me
what's happening.</i>

40:31.645 --> 40:33.813
<i>Olivia?</i>

40:33.880 --> 40:35.248
Okay.

40:35.315 --> 40:37.450
Okay, I think he's stabilizing.

40:37.517 --> 40:39.485
Everything's okay.

41:22.095 --> 41:23.262
Hey.

41:23.330 --> 41:26.265
I made you some...
Rosemary chicken soup.

41:26.333 --> 41:28.267
How are you feeling, son?

41:28.335 --> 41:30.269
I'm better.

41:30.337 --> 41:32.338
Thank you.

41:33.507 --> 41:35.174
What are you thanking me for?

41:35.242 --> 41:38.244
For what you did.

41:38.312 --> 41:41.280
My serum was flawed.

41:41.348 --> 41:44.817
It would have killed me
if I'd taken it.

41:44.885 --> 41:48.454
You only lived 'cause
you're young and healthy.

41:48.522 --> 41:51.324
And I suspect...That's what
this was all about.

41:51.391 --> 41:53.292
You lost me, Walter.

41:53.360 --> 41:54.994
I think...

41:55.062 --> 41:58.297
The observer saved my life.

41:58.365 --> 42:00.299
When he gave you
a knock on the head

42:00.367 --> 42:02.501
so you'd take some aspirin
and wash it down with the milk

42:02.569 --> 42:04.570
so you'd ingest the serum
instead of me.

42:04.638 --> 42:06.172
I think
if that's all he wanted,

42:06.239 --> 42:07.740
there must have been
an easier way.

42:07.808 --> 42:09.575
Well, he's not human.

42:09.643 --> 42:12.011
You can't expect him
to think like us.

42:13.980 --> 42:15.748
Thank you.

42:39.773 --> 42:41.874
I must admit,

42:41.942 --> 42:44.844
I feared
my experiment would fail.

42:44.911 --> 42:46.345
But you were right.

42:46.413 --> 42:49.582
He's changed.

42:49.649 --> 42:53.285
He was willing
to let his son die.

42:53.353 --> 42:55.921
Yes.

42:55.989 --> 42:59.358
And now we know.

42:59.426 --> 43:02.128
When the time comes...

43:02.195 --> 43:05.564
He will be willing
to do it again.
