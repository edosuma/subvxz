WEBVTT

01:11.947 --> 01:13.782
Slow down.

01:13.782 --> 01:16.117
You're gonna make yourself sick.

01:42.061 --> 01:43.854
You know,

01:43.854 --> 01:46.565
we're sitting
on 7 million bucks here.

01:46.565 --> 01:47.649
Literally.

01:48.609 --> 01:49.944
And?

01:53.447 --> 01:57.284
Say we take it,
split it 50-50...

01:58.452 --> 02:00.579
take off.

02:00.579 --> 02:02.330
It's not ours.

02:04.499 --> 02:05.751
Could be.

02:07.586 --> 02:11.256
Yeah, well, I know some people
who'd have a problem with that.

02:11.256 --> 02:12.507
Them?

02:14.301 --> 02:16.177
Don't worry about them.

02:20.975 --> 02:22.684
You feeling right?

02:28.065 --> 02:30.109
First thing we do,

02:30.109 --> 02:34.113
take 6 million bucks
and build a time machine.

02:34.113 --> 02:36.991
Those people
that you're worried about?

02:36.991 --> 02:39.034
They'll never find us.

02:41.996 --> 02:44.498
Where would you go first, huh?

02:44.498 --> 02:47.668
You look like a history buff.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.671
What, would you go
to Civil War times

02:50.671 --> 02:53.590
or ancient Rome?

02:53.590 --> 02:55.634
Oh, Christ.

03:04.143 --> 03:06.728
December 8, 2001.

03:08.022 --> 03:09.439
Why?

03:10.565 --> 03:12.609
No, no.

03:16.195 --> 03:18.699
March 17, 1984.

03:24.245 --> 03:26.373
Day I took my first bribe.

03:33.505 --> 03:35.298
And then I'd go forward.

03:36.967 --> 03:41.055
There's some people I'd like to
check on in five or ten years,

03:41.055 --> 03:43.348
make sure they're doing okay.

03:48.729 --> 03:49.813
You?

03:51.356 --> 03:53.067
Heh, it's easy.

03:54.526 --> 03:57.112
May 10, 1965.

04:01.158 --> 04:05.495
That's the day Warren Buffett
took over at Berkshire Hathaway.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.916
I figure, got a million left

04:08.916 --> 04:10.625
from building the time machine,

04:10.625 --> 04:15.797
so I'd take my half and
just stick it into Berkshire.

04:15.797 --> 04:19.051
And then I come back here,
and...

04:21.011 --> 04:22.679
I'm a billionaire.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.641
Oh...

04:28.102 --> 04:30.687
Is there such a thing
as a trillionaire?

04:32.397 --> 04:34.524
That's it? Money?

04:36.317 --> 04:38.028
What else?

04:38.028 --> 04:39.988
Nothing you'd change?

04:50.165 --> 04:51.666
I'm rested.

05:35.543 --> 05:37.337
<i>Marion, are you still there?</i>

05:37.337 --> 05:40.340
Yes. It's a--
It's a little car, beige.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.383
I-- I don't know the make.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.307
64P...

05:51.559 --> 05:53.228
FT6.

05:53.228 --> 05:55.981
He's headed south,
towards Curtis.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.860
Oh, please, get him.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.119
<i>12-42 responding.</i>

06:11.205 --> 06:13.540
<i>V as in Victor.</i>
<i>That's a Saturn Aura?</i>

06:13.540 --> 06:18.045
<i>That is correct, Saturn Aura.</i>
<i>Nebraska, 6-4-Paul-Frank-Tom...</i>

06:23.717 --> 06:27.470
<i>White male, late 40s,</i>
<i>about 5'11", 180 pounds.</i>

09:11.759 --> 09:16.723
"Hoover Max Extract
Pressure-Pro Model 60."

09:16.723 --> 09:22.645
Hoover Pressure-Pro
Max Extract Model 60.

10:09.401 --> 10:11.152
Anybody home?

10:16.699 --> 10:18.910
Hands now.

10:38.305 --> 10:41.558
<i>I was at a party,</i>
<i>just minding my own business.</i>

10:43.143 --> 10:45.103
<i>You are under arrest.</i>

10:45.103 --> 10:47.814
<i>I'd better call Saul.</i>

10:47.814 --> 10:49.232
<i>Hi, I'm Saul Goodman.</i>

10:49.232 --> 10:51.192
<i>Did you know</i>
<i>that you have rights?</i>

10:51.192 --> 10:54.028
<i>Constitution says you do.</i>
<i>And so do I.</i>

10:54.028 --> 10:56.323
<i>I believe</i>
<i>that until proven guilty,</i>

10:56.323 --> 10:59.576
<i>every man, woman and child</i>
<i>in this country is innocent.</i>

10:59.576 --> 11:01.995
<i>And that's why</i>
<i>I fight for you, Albuquerque.</i>

11:21.680 --> 11:23.642
Hello, Krista. It's Gene.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.686
Uh, sorry I wasn't in
this morning.

11:27.686 --> 11:29.439
Did you open up okay?

11:30.731 --> 11:33.860
I'm fine.
C-could you do me a favor?

11:35.862 --> 11:38.739
The week's rotation
needs to be posted by 3.

11:38.739 --> 11:40.325
Could you handle that?

11:42.118 --> 11:43.953
Now, one more thing. Um...

11:45.163 --> 11:46.581
Just call the main office.

11:46.581 --> 11:48.500
The number is on
the bulletin board.

11:48.500 --> 11:51.670
And, uh,
let them know, um...

11:53.754 --> 11:55.923
you're gonna need
a new manager.

12:00.595 --> 12:02.889
This is how they get you?

12:04.349 --> 12:06.142
This is how they get you?

12:11.147 --> 12:13.107
This is how they get you?

12:14.192 --> 12:16.944
This is how they get you?

12:16.944 --> 12:18.905
Jesus.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.990
What were you thinking?

12:22.825 --> 12:26.871
What were you thinking?

12:34.879 --> 12:37.257
Ah, shit.

13:17.338 --> 13:18.632
Hey!

13:19.882 --> 13:23.136
I need another phone call!

13:23.136 --> 13:25.430
Another phone call!

13:40.153 --> 13:41.571
William Oakley and Associates.

13:41.571 --> 13:43.615
Trust experience,
trust Oakley.

13:43.615 --> 13:45.074
Bill Oakley speaking.

13:45.074 --> 13:47.160
<i>"Trust experience,</i>
<i>trust Oakley."</i>

13:47.160 --> 13:49.746
<i>I like that. It's catchy.</i>

13:49.746 --> 13:51.830
<i>You know who this is, right?</i>

13:54.917 --> 13:56.043
Saul?

13:56.043 --> 13:58.296
<i>You got it, buddy.</i>

13:58.296 --> 14:00.089
What-- What are you, uh--?

14:00.089 --> 14:02.592
What are you doing?

14:02.592 --> 14:05.011
Uh, you know I'm gonna
have to report this call.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.471
<i>Whoa, calm down, junior.</i>

14:06.471 --> 14:08.348
<i>The cops know</i>
<i>all about the call.</i>

14:08.348 --> 14:10.517
<i>They're probably listening in.</i>
<i>The fact is,</i>

14:10.517 --> 14:14.145
<i>I'm standing in the middle of</i>
<i>a police station as we speak.</i>

14:15.480 --> 14:17.148
So they finally caught you.

14:17.148 --> 14:19.818
<i>Listen, this is your lucky day.</i>
<i>I am talking</i>

14:19.818 --> 14:23.279
<i>to Saul Goodman's</i>
<i>new advisory counsel.</i>

14:23.279 --> 14:25.365
What?
Keep up, Bill.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.033
You hit the jackpot.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.451
<i>Advisory counsel?</i>

14:28.451 --> 14:30.537
This puts you on the map,
amigo.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.038
Here's what you're gonna do.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.833
You're gonna grab a flight
to Omaha, Nebraska, ASAP.

14:34.833 --> 14:36.125
There's nothing direct,

14:36.125 --> 14:37.877
so you'll have to connect
through Houston.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.878
Who's paying for this?

14:39.878 --> 14:42.632
<i>You are. Listen, you hear that?</i>
Hear what?

14:42.632 --> 14:45.510
Bang, bang!
That's opportunity knocking.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.679
Get off your ass
and answer the door.

14:47.679 --> 14:48.971
Okay, on your way,

14:48.971 --> 14:50.598
make some calls.
<i>Wait, wait. Hold on.</i>

14:50.598 --> 14:52.433
Even supposing hypothetically

14:52.433 --> 14:53.976
I'd be willing
to take this on...

14:53.976 --> 14:56.062
<i>Willing?</i>
<i>Bill, this is a career-maker.</i>

14:56.062 --> 14:57.522
<i>Get real. You're doing this.</i>

14:57.522 --> 15:00.567
The DA has a warehouse
of evidence against you.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.486
I can't even begin to imagine
what the feds are sitting on.

15:03.486 --> 15:05.530
<i>No matter who your lawyer is,</i>

15:05.530 --> 15:07.532
<i>you are screwed.</i>

15:07.532 --> 15:10.993
<i>So I gotta ask,</i>
<i>where do you see this ending?</i>

15:13.663 --> 15:15.623
Where do I see it ending? Um...

15:16.915 --> 15:19.753
With me on top, like always.

15:42.776 --> 15:45.278
WOMAN:<i>RICO.</i>
MAN:<i>Not five, not ten,</i>

15:45.278 --> 15:47.906
but 27 predicate violations.

15:47.906 --> 15:49.282
Conspiracy to manufacture

15:49.282 --> 15:50.867
and distribute
a controlled substance.

15:50.867 --> 15:53.703
On this scale?
Life sentence, stat max.

15:53.703 --> 15:54.954
Money laundering.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.623
Eight counts, 20 years each.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.500
One hundred sixty years,
stat max.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.878
We'll argue
for consecutive sentencing.

16:01.878 --> 16:04.547
Accessory after the fact
to multiple murders.

16:04.547 --> 16:07.717
Including two
decorated federal officers.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.886
Fifteen years each.

16:09.886 --> 16:11.971
By our count,
that's life plus...

16:11.971 --> 16:13.848
One hundred ninety.

16:13.848 --> 16:16.309
Life plus 190 years.

16:18.394 --> 16:21.063
All right.
I'm willing to extend

16:21.063 --> 16:23.399
a one-time,
take-it-or-leave-it offer.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.401
Here's the headline.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.153
Thirty years.

16:27.153 --> 16:29.614
Keep your nose clean,
stay healthy,

16:29.614 --> 16:32.533
you have a shot at seeing
daylight in your old age.

16:36.203 --> 16:38.957
Mr. Oakley, your co-counsel,

16:38.957 --> 16:41.793
is he here with us?
All right, listen.

16:41.793 --> 16:44.170
You've got Agent Schrader's
widow back there.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.255
Why don't you invite her in?
Uh, wait--

16:46.255 --> 16:47.966
You owe her that much,
don't you?

16:47.966 --> 16:50.092
She can't be present
at a plea negotiation.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.470
It's completely inappropriate.
She's already here.

16:52.470 --> 16:55.306
Both parties agree,
so it's fine, really.

17:36.347 --> 17:39.433
They tell me they found you
in a garbage dumpster.

17:41.644 --> 17:43.270
Well, that makes sense.

17:46.482 --> 17:49.694
My husband was the best man
that I've ever known.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.865
He lived to help others.

17:55.282 --> 17:56.993
If somebody was in trouble,

17:56.993 --> 17:59.495
no matter the time,
no matter the place,

17:59.495 --> 18:02.456
Hank Schrader would be there...

18:05.877 --> 18:07.754
with a smile and a joke.

18:10.882 --> 18:13.133
He was kind.

18:14.052 --> 18:15.469
He was decent.

18:16.387 --> 18:18.056
He was strong.

18:21.267 --> 18:26.146
His partner... Steve Gomez,

18:26.146 --> 18:29.817
Steve and Blanca made a home

18:29.817 --> 18:32.737
that was warm
and full of laughter.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.406
Three children.

18:36.449 --> 18:41.704
Three fatherless children.

18:43.539 --> 18:46.208
Hank and Steve,
the good guys...

18:48.002 --> 18:50.546
they were shot dead...

18:50.546 --> 18:53.091
and left in a hole
in the desert.

18:55.635 --> 18:56.844
And you...

18:58.096 --> 19:01.348
you helped the two-faced
poisonous bastard

19:01.348 --> 19:03.017
behind it all.

19:05.019 --> 19:06.312
For what?

19:07.438 --> 19:08.648
Money.

19:10.942 --> 19:14.445
You did it all... for money.

19:16.030 --> 19:18.240
No matter
what they do with you now,

19:18.240 --> 19:20.743
no matter where they put you
or for how long,

19:20.743 --> 19:24.122
it will never be enough.

19:32.922 --> 19:34.590
Mrs.--

19:34.590 --> 19:36.425
Mrs. Schrader...

19:38.218 --> 19:40.304
...the loss
that you've suffered,

19:40.304 --> 19:42.056
it's unspeakable.

19:46.978 --> 19:51.899
I met your husband
a few times.

19:51.899 --> 19:54.276
He was a man
who stood by his word

19:54.276 --> 19:57.196
and was very good at his job.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.781
Straight shooter.

20:00.616 --> 20:04.328
You and he are... victims.

20:08.248 --> 20:09.709
And so am I.

20:14.881 --> 20:18.509
Two years ago,
a man came into my office.

20:19.635 --> 20:22.805
He said his name was Mayhew.

20:22.805 --> 20:26.726
He wanted one of my clients
to lie under oath.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.020
He offered me money.

20:29.020 --> 20:30.563
I declined.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.106
Any lawyer would.

20:33.440 --> 20:37.195
That night,
as I was leaving my office,

20:37.195 --> 20:38.320
I was attacked.

20:39.864 --> 20:41.949
Two men threw a sack
over my head.

20:41.949 --> 20:45.745
They hogtied me, and they
drove me out into the desert.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.580
And when
they pulled the hood off,

20:47.580 --> 20:52.043
I was kneeling
in front of an open grave,

20:52.043 --> 20:55.004
with a gun pointed at my head.

20:55.004 --> 20:57.882
That was my introduction
to Walter White.

21:01.468 --> 21:02.929
From that moment on...

21:04.388 --> 21:07.141
there hasn't been a minute
that I wasn't afraid.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.144
Yeah, I worked for him.

21:10.144 --> 21:11.771
I made a lot of money.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.814
But that's not why I did it.

21:13.814 --> 21:18.360
I did it because I knew what
he would do to me if I refused.

21:18.360 --> 21:21.030
Over and over, I thought
about going to the police.

21:21.030 --> 21:23.365
I even thought about
talking to Agent Schrader.

21:23.365 --> 21:26.244
But I knew that Walter White

21:26.244 --> 21:29.622
would kill me wherever I was.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.165
And I was right.

21:32.166 --> 21:34.001
You look it up.

21:34.001 --> 21:36.963
October 4, 2009.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.881
They murdered ten men

21:38.881 --> 21:43.886
inside three prisons
in the space of two minutes.

21:43.886 --> 21:45.638
Knifed.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.347
Throats slashed.

21:47.347 --> 21:49.809
A man was burned alive.

21:49.809 --> 21:53.479
They even killed
one of my colleagues, a lawyer.

21:53.479 --> 21:56.065
He was cooperating with the DEA.

21:57.441 --> 21:59.193
Daniel Wachsberger.

22:00.444 --> 22:02.947
The news said Dan...

22:04.031 --> 22:06.117
was stabbed 48 times.

22:07.868 --> 22:12.290
So, yeah, when it all blew up,
I ran.

22:12.290 --> 22:14.500
But not from the police.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.668
From them.

22:17.295 --> 22:19.005
Walter White might be dead.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.299
But Jesse Pinkman
and the others,

22:21.299 --> 22:24.218
they're still out there,
somewhere.

22:27.305 --> 22:29.515
Mrs. Schrader,

22:29.515 --> 22:33.102
you are looking at a man
who has lost everything.

22:33.102 --> 22:36.147
My profession,
my family, my freedom.

22:37.064 --> 22:39.233
I have-- I have nobody.

22:39.233 --> 22:40.818
I have nothing.

22:49.869 --> 22:52.746
And you think jurors
are gonna buy that?

22:56.209 --> 22:57.584
One.

22:59.837 --> 23:01.630
All I need is one.

23:05.176 --> 23:09.096
Oakley tells me
that you've never lost a case.

23:10.264 --> 23:11.849
Is that so?

23:13.059 --> 23:15.144
It's a hell of a record.

23:15.144 --> 23:16.603
You should be
proud of that.

23:16.603 --> 23:17.980
Still...

23:17.980 --> 23:20.440
juries, right?

23:20.440 --> 23:24.945
Whew! You never can tell.
It's a roll of the dice.

23:26.322 --> 23:29.533
I'm just-- I'm hoping
there's some wiggle room.

23:31.952 --> 23:34.705
You are not going
to negotiate with this man.

23:34.705 --> 23:36.207
You're not.

24:06.237 --> 24:07.780
"Seventeen:

24:07.780 --> 24:09.823
After sentence has been imposed

24:09.823 --> 24:12.701
on the counts to which
defendant pleads guilty,

24:12.701 --> 24:14.494
as agreed herein,

24:14.494 --> 24:16.330
the government will move
to dismiss

24:16.330 --> 24:19.666
counts three through nine
of the indictment.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.086
Eighteen:

24:22.086 --> 24:24.546
Based on the facts
now known to the government,

24:24.546 --> 24:29.051
the anticipated offense level
is 35, which, when combined

24:29.051 --> 24:32.430
with the anticipated criminal
history category of one,

24:32.430 --> 24:35.308
results in an anticipated
advisory sentencing

24:35.308 --> 24:39.270
guidelines range
of 85 to 90 months imprisonment

24:39.270 --> 24:41.772
in addition
to any supervised release,

24:41.772 --> 24:45.234
fine and restitution
the court may impose."

24:48.154 --> 24:49.863
Seven and a half years.

24:51.489 --> 24:54.034
Let's get this thing signed
and get the hell out of here.

24:54.034 --> 24:56.245
We're good with that.
"Nineteen:

24:57.204 --> 24:58.872
Term to be served

24:58.872 --> 25:02.251
at FCI Butner Low,
North Carolina,

25:02.251 --> 25:03.752
Wing D."

25:05.629 --> 25:09.342
FCI Butner Low.
It's a great location.

25:09.342 --> 25:11.469
Very nice weather.

25:11.469 --> 25:14.512
It's the only federal
institution with a golf program.

25:14.512 --> 25:17.308
It's good enough
for Bernie Madoff.

25:17.308 --> 25:19.517
This is
an actual request?

25:19.517 --> 25:22.188
Heh, you kidding?
I give you guys half a chance,

25:22.188 --> 25:25.858
you're gonna throw me
into gen pop in some hellhole.

25:25.858 --> 25:29.695
I visited a client once
at ADX Montrose.

25:29.695 --> 25:32.865
"The Alcatraz of the Rockies."
No.

25:32.865 --> 25:35.201
No, that's a deal breaker,
my friend.

25:43.959 --> 25:46.170
FCI Butner Low, Wing...

25:46.170 --> 25:48.714
D. Wing D.

25:48.714 --> 25:50.716
Wing D.

25:50.716 --> 25:52.968
And now we are done.

25:52.968 --> 25:56.763
Ah, as Steve Jobs used to say:
"One more thing."

25:56.763 --> 25:58.307
"Twenty:

25:58.307 --> 25:59.808
During incarceration,

25:59.808 --> 26:01.268
defendant Goodman to receive

26:01.268 --> 26:04.313
one pint Blue Bell
mint chocolate chip ice cream

26:04.313 --> 26:06.690
every Friday
for the duration."

26:06.690 --> 26:09.026
Are you kidding?
He's kidding.

26:09.026 --> 26:12.071
Blue Bell. Mint Chocolate Chip.
No substitutions.

26:12.071 --> 26:14.114
Okay. That's it.

26:14.114 --> 26:16.450
Hold on.
I can oil everybody's locks.

26:16.450 --> 26:18.536
No more games.
I got a sweetener.

26:18.536 --> 26:20.496
It's nothing I've talked about.

26:20.496 --> 26:22.706
New arena. Primo stuff.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.838
Go.

26:29.838 --> 26:35.344
Inside story, previously unknown
felony homicide.

26:35.344 --> 26:40.140
Concerns a prominent Albuquerque
attorney who, uh, disappeared,

26:40.140 --> 26:44.019
believed to have killed himself.
Howard Hamlin?

26:44.019 --> 26:46.105
You're talking
about Howard Hamlin?

26:46.105 --> 26:47.689
That's your sweetener?

26:48.941 --> 26:52.027
He's trying to sell us
the Hamlin thing.

26:52.027 --> 26:54.738
He thought
he really had something.

26:54.738 --> 26:56.823
Sounds like you and your ex
aren't talking

26:56.823 --> 26:59.535
on a regular basis.
Kim Wexler

26:59.535 --> 27:02.580
walked into the Albuquerque
DA's office last month.

27:02.580 --> 27:06.792
She spilled her guts about
Howard Hamlin. On the record.

27:06.792 --> 27:10.170
You got nothing left to sell.

27:10.170 --> 27:11.671
Last chance.

27:11.671 --> 27:15.092
Do we go to trial
or do we have a deal?

27:16.469 --> 27:19.305
Yes. Yes.
We have a deal.

27:19.305 --> 27:21.265
Let's get this in writing.

27:21.265 --> 27:23.601
Not a word changes.

27:56.758 --> 27:58.218
Of course.

28:00.220 --> 28:02.222
Ow!

28:12.024 --> 28:15.902
Am I gonna be sorry
if I ask what's going on?

28:15.902 --> 28:18.071
I'm putting a stop to it.

28:18.071 --> 28:19.615
Stop to what?

28:21.074 --> 28:22.368
"To what?"

28:23.452 --> 28:25.954
Listen. Just listen.

28:30.376 --> 28:31.460
That click?

28:31.460 --> 28:33.671
The click.

28:33.671 --> 28:39.218
The flame is lighting
and then it keeps going out.

28:39.218 --> 28:40.718
So it's either...

28:42.012 --> 28:43.847
a thermocouple
that's corroded

28:43.847 --> 28:45.558
or we have a short.

28:46.517 --> 28:48.185
A thermocouple
is corroded.

28:48.185 --> 28:49.727
Okay, I got it.

28:49.727 --> 28:52.147
Hey, uh, maybe we could
just unplug it?

28:52.147 --> 28:55.442
Or cut a wire or something?
No, listen, I...

28:55.442 --> 29:00.155
see no reason to stay
down here without hot water

29:00.155 --> 29:02.491
when it's something
that I can easily fix.

29:02.491 --> 29:04.034
Aha!

29:04.034 --> 29:07.162
I think this will do the trick.

29:07.162 --> 29:10.082
You wouldn't happen to have
a pocket knife or screwdriver

29:10.082 --> 29:12.876
in one of those bags, would you?
No.

29:12.876 --> 29:14.587
What? Speak up.

29:14.587 --> 29:16.088
No.

29:27.891 --> 29:29.518
Come on.

29:29.518 --> 29:31.019
There we go.

29:40.279 --> 29:41.739
This should work.

29:58.171 --> 30:00.173
Hey, you're a scientist,
right?

30:00.173 --> 30:01.675
So, uh, I have a question.

30:01.675 --> 30:04.678
What would you do
if you had a time machine?

30:05.763 --> 30:08.181
A time machine?

30:09.266 --> 30:11.268
Yeah.

30:11.268 --> 30:13.186
From a scientist's
point of view.

30:13.186 --> 30:15.230
You can go backwards,
forwards, uh...

30:15.230 --> 30:16.356
Where would you go?

30:16.356 --> 30:18.525
A meaningless question.

30:18.525 --> 30:20.277
Time... Huh.

30:20.277 --> 30:23.071
Time machine. Look.

30:23.071 --> 30:25.865
Time travel.
The kind of time travel

30:25.865 --> 30:28.868
that you're thinking of
is a scientific impossibility.

30:28.868 --> 30:31.789
It would violate the second law
of thermodynamics.

30:31.789 --> 30:33.749
Uh, but what about a wormhole?

30:33.749 --> 30:35.833
Oh!
Well, I was watching NOVA,

30:35.833 --> 30:38.878
and Alan Alda seemed to think--
Oh, well, then, Alan Alda,

30:38.878 --> 30:40.088
he's the expert.

30:40.088 --> 30:43.008
Oh, Christ.
Are you kidding me?

30:43.008 --> 30:46.052
Quantum mechanics?
We're discussing that now?

30:47.680 --> 30:49.723
Stay in your lane.

30:53.851 --> 30:56.563
It's just
a thought experiment.

30:56.563 --> 30:59.983
There's gotta be something you'd
go back and change if you could.

31:04.738 --> 31:06.573
You are not...

31:06.573 --> 31:08.659
talking about a time machine,

31:08.659 --> 31:12.579
which is both a real
and theoretical impossibility.

31:12.579 --> 31:14.623
You are talking about
regrets.

31:14.623 --> 31:18.043
So if you want to ask
about regrets,

31:18.043 --> 31:20.879
just ask about regrets

31:20.879 --> 31:23.590
and leave all this
time-traveling nonsense

31:23.590 --> 31:26.468
out of it.
Okay. Regrets, then.

31:30.055 --> 31:31.931
Regrets?

31:31.931 --> 31:33.141
Yeah.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.647
My regrets.
All right, well...

31:42.900 --> 31:44.236
My regrets.

32:00.586 --> 32:01.837
Well...

32:10.011 --> 32:12.305
When I was a graduate student,

32:12.305 --> 32:15.434
I started a company with some--

32:16.894 --> 32:19.438
At the time,
I thought they were my friends.

32:21.064 --> 32:26.152
Our goal was to commercialize
discoveries that I had made.

32:28.071 --> 32:31.533
And at a certain point...

32:33.952 --> 32:35.495
I stepped away.

32:35.495 --> 32:37.956
I thought I was doing
the gentlemanly thing.

32:39.249 --> 32:40.876
But little did I understand

32:40.876 --> 32:44.087
that they were
artfully maneuvering me

32:44.087 --> 32:46.632
into leaving my own creation.

32:49.885 --> 32:52.095
And had I stayed, oh...

32:54.681 --> 32:55.849
Well...

32:57.016 --> 32:59.269
I wouldn't be down here
with you.

33:00.270 --> 33:01.897
So you started a company?

33:01.897 --> 33:03.231
Is it still around?

33:05.191 --> 33:06.401
Oh, yes.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.279
Is it successful?

33:10.823 --> 33:12.282
Very.

33:12.282 --> 33:14.910
How could you never tell me
about this?

33:14.910 --> 33:16.870
We could have
done something with this.

33:16.870 --> 33:18.455
Wrongful termination.

33:18.455 --> 33:21.291
Intellectual property theft.
Uh, patent fraud.

33:21.291 --> 33:24.085
I mean, I could've
sunk my teeth into this.

33:24.085 --> 33:28.841
You'd have been the last lawyer
I'd have gone to.

33:30.550 --> 33:32.135
Yeah, sure.

33:35.806 --> 33:37.474
So, what about you?

33:39.058 --> 33:40.560
Regrets.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.984
Uh--
Wait, I got one.

33:52.155 --> 33:53.448
You know what, never mind.

33:53.448 --> 33:56.702
Ahem, when I was
20, um... 22,

33:56.702 --> 34:00.246
I pulled a slip-and-fall
outside Marshall Field's. I did.

34:00.246 --> 34:03.583
And I was stupid and young,
and I was trying to show off,

34:03.583 --> 34:05.544
so I hit the ice
as fast as I could--

34:05.544 --> 34:07.044
I biffed it so hard

34:07.044 --> 34:08.755
I heard a crack. Whew!

34:08.755 --> 34:10.799
Wasn't the ice. Was me.

34:11.967 --> 34:14.135
I actually hurt myself.

34:14.135 --> 34:17.848
I mean, I--
My knee's never been the same.

34:19.641 --> 34:21.309
A slip-and-fall?

34:21.309 --> 34:25.355
Yeah, that's how I put myself
through bartending school.

34:27.524 --> 34:28.859
Right.

34:32.821 --> 34:34.239
So...

34:39.118 --> 34:41.454
So you were always like this?

35:36.051 --> 35:37.677
I'm sorry.

35:42.641 --> 35:44.684
Psst, Bill. Hey.

35:44.684 --> 35:46.519
I'm just going to...
Sir,

35:46.519 --> 35:50.607
this man is a federal prisoner,
I'm a U.S. Marshal.

35:50.607 --> 35:53.026
I'm gonna ask you
not to speak to him.

35:53.026 --> 35:54.611
That's my lawyer.

35:56.154 --> 35:59.240
Is that true, you're his lawyer?
Yes.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.284
You'll have other opportunities
to talk.

36:01.284 --> 36:03.703
Please move out of the aisle.
Hold up.

36:03.703 --> 36:07.582
Nothing I say in front of you
is privileged, right?

36:07.582 --> 36:09.835
That's right.
So if I talk to my attorney

36:09.835 --> 36:11.128
and let something slip

36:11.128 --> 36:13.046
that could help
the government's case,

36:13.046 --> 36:16.341
you could pass it along to
the prosecution. Totally clean.

36:16.341 --> 36:18.593
Correct.

36:18.593 --> 36:22.514
With that in mind, you're sure
we can't have a few words?

36:28.728 --> 36:30.022
Make it fast.

36:31.397 --> 36:32.607
She confessed.

36:32.607 --> 36:34.067
What's the DA gonna do with it?

36:34.067 --> 36:37.529
No witnesses,
no physical evidence.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.238
If I had to guess...

36:39.238 --> 36:42.075
Most likely they sit on it.
Permanently.

36:43.827 --> 36:45.453
Okay.

36:45.453 --> 36:47.998
No. Not okay.

36:47.998 --> 36:50.000
Not for her.
Her problem's not the DA.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.627
What, then?
Well, apparently,

36:52.627 --> 36:55.212
Kim took her sworn-and-notarized
statement

36:55.212 --> 36:57.298
and hand-delivered it
to Hamlin's widow.

36:57.298 --> 36:59.425
No.
Yes.

36:59.425 --> 37:01.386
She opened herself up
to a civil suit.

37:01.386 --> 37:03.805
The widow can take her
for everything she has,

37:03.805 --> 37:06.766
and everything she's gonna have,
in perpetuity.

37:06.766 --> 37:09.268
So is she suing?

37:10.520 --> 37:12.271
All I can tell you for sure

37:12.271 --> 37:16.693
is that Mrs. Hamlin's out
lawyer shopping as we speak.

37:16.693 --> 37:19.112
Not that she bothered
to call me.

37:22.157 --> 37:25.451
Hey, can I, uh, go
to the john now?

37:27.620 --> 37:29.664
I'm going.

37:56.858 --> 37:59.778
Hold up, Bill. No, wait.
You're gonna love this.

37:59.778 --> 38:02.614
The Hamlin thing? Government
doesn't know the half of it.

38:02.614 --> 38:03.990
As soon as we land,

38:03.990 --> 38:05.617
I want you
to tell the other side

38:05.617 --> 38:07.410
that I've got more to trade,
okay?

38:07.410 --> 38:11.164
I just remembered something
that will make their toes curl.

38:11.164 --> 38:12.457
Okay.

38:12.457 --> 38:14.751
Anything that makes
their toes curl

38:14.751 --> 38:16.753
is bound to jam Kim up.

38:16.753 --> 38:20.090
If it involves her.
Oh, it involves her.

38:20.090 --> 38:23.301
Kim's already got a civil suit
hanging over her head.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.178
You give the government more,

38:25.178 --> 38:27.430
maybe they bring
the hammer down.

38:29.390 --> 38:32.185
What more are you gonna get?
What's left?

38:32.185 --> 38:35.688
You don't understand.
It's really good ice cream.

39:00.213 --> 39:02.381
Boys again?
Girls this time.

39:02.381 --> 39:04.550
Well, she's not sleeping
for a year or two.

39:04.550 --> 39:06.678
At least.
Is she coming back?

39:06.678 --> 39:08.263
She'll have to.

39:08.263 --> 39:10.140
Josh is a twin, isn't he?
Oh, yeah.

39:10.140 --> 39:11.808
And it's his birthday
next week.

39:11.808 --> 39:13.893
I always take him out,
just the two of us,

39:13.893 --> 39:15.603
because he had to share
everything.

39:15.603 --> 39:17.605
That's nice.
It's either Red Lobster

39:17.605 --> 39:20.399
or that new Middle Eastern place
over on Wickham.

39:20.399 --> 39:22.277
"Top" something?
Topkapi.

39:22.277 --> 39:24.154
That's it.
Topkapi.

39:24.154 --> 39:27.115
Glen took you there, didn't he?
What did you guys think?

39:27.115 --> 39:28.825
Uh...

39:28.825 --> 39:30.576
It wasn't...

39:30.576 --> 39:32.578
Not good, huh?

39:32.578 --> 39:34.831
No, uh-- No, it was fine.

39:34.831 --> 39:36.374
Would Josh like it?

39:38.877 --> 39:40.377
He-- He might.

39:40.377 --> 39:42.964
Okay. Another birthday
at Red Lobster.

39:42.964 --> 39:44.716
He can live with that.

39:44.716 --> 39:47.593
What do we get them for
the shower? A stroller, right?

39:47.593 --> 39:50.305
Yeah, one of the nice ones
with the shock absorbers.

39:50.305 --> 39:53.266
But twins? Won't they need
a double stroller?

39:53.266 --> 39:54.392
I think there was...

40:15.454 --> 40:16.998
...get her for you.

40:16.998 --> 40:19.209
You too, Donny.

40:19.209 --> 40:24.714
Seana? Donny from
TPC Sawgrass, line four.

40:24.714 --> 40:26.383
Hey, Tammy.
I'm leaving early.

40:26.383 --> 40:28.343
Can you let Ricardo know?
Sure. No prob.

40:28.343 --> 40:30.303
Thanks.

40:30.303 --> 40:34.515
Palm Coast Sprinkler. Watering
your world since 1978...

41:49.715 --> 41:52.302
If he shows up,
you keep that door locked.

41:52.302 --> 41:54.846
You call the police
and then you call me.

41:54.846 --> 41:57.349
Any time, day or night. Okay?

41:57.349 --> 41:58.850
Okay.
I'll see you Thursday.

41:58.850 --> 42:00.935
Let me know if you need me
to pick you up.

42:00.935 --> 42:02.687
Thank you.
Okay.

42:09.235 --> 42:12.322
Ladies, it's right this way.
Sorry about the heat.

42:12.322 --> 42:14.073
AC's on the fritz.

42:22.999 --> 42:25.877
Fill this out. And before
you ask, there's no charge.

42:25.877 --> 42:27.670
All our services are free.

42:27.670 --> 42:31.508
Oh, uh, actually I'm here
to see if I can volunteer.

42:31.508 --> 42:33.676
You want to volunteer?

42:33.676 --> 42:35.011
Yes.

42:35.011 --> 42:36.513
Can you answer a phone?

42:36.513 --> 42:37.763
Sure.

42:37.763 --> 42:39.807
Then there you go.

42:46.147 --> 42:49.192
Central Florida Legal Aid.
How can I help you?

43:28.022 --> 43:29.941
Hello?
SUZANNE:<i>Kim?</i>

43:29.941 --> 43:31.526
Yes?

43:31.526 --> 43:33.403
<i>This is Suzanne Ericsen.</i>

43:33.403 --> 43:35.154
Hi, Suzanne.

43:35.154 --> 43:38.783
I want to make it clear this
call is completely unofficial.

43:38.783 --> 43:40.368
<i>All right.</i>

43:40.368 --> 43:42.161
I shouldn't
even be talking to you.

43:42.161 --> 43:43.662
But considering everything,

43:43.662 --> 43:45.873
I think it's only right
you know what's going on.

43:45.873 --> 43:47.333
<i>You've seen the news?</i>

43:48.667 --> 43:49.710
I don't think so.

43:49.710 --> 43:53.089
<i>Your ex, Saul Goodman?</i>

43:53.089 --> 43:54.799
<i>He was arrested in Nebraska.</i>

43:54.799 --> 43:57.135
<i>He's been extradited</i>
<i>to New Mexico.</i>

44:01.013 --> 44:03.516
When was this?
<i>Two days ago.</i>

44:04.642 --> 44:07.395
<i>But that's not why</i>
<i>I'm calling.</i>

44:07.395 --> 44:11.316
<i>He's giving testimony</i>
<i>that affects you. Personally.</i>

44:14.652 --> 44:17.113
What kind of testimony?

44:33.671 --> 44:40.094
<i>♪ Only believe ♪</i>

44:40.970 --> 44:42.680
<i>♪ My lordy ♪</i>

45:57.338 --> 45:59.090

46:01.758 --> 46:05.722
All rise for the Right Honorable
Judge Samantha Small.

46:09.100 --> 46:12.186
Court's now in session.
Please take a seat.

46:16.941 --> 46:21.487
Okay, item one on the calendar,

46:21.487 --> 46:25.908
CR 10-7253,
<i>United States of America v...</i>

46:27.410 --> 46:30.538
Defendant has requested
to use the name Saul Goodman.

46:30.538 --> 46:34.791
So it's<i>United States</i>
<i>v. Saul Goodman.</i>

46:34.791 --> 46:36.877
Counsel, please state
your appearances.

46:39.547 --> 46:42.133
AUSA George Castellano.

46:42.133 --> 46:44.969
With me is Elizabeth Nooryani,

46:44.969 --> 46:47.472
trial attorney from
the Drug Enforcement section

46:47.472 --> 46:49.223
of the Department of Justice.

46:49.223 --> 46:53.060
AUSAs Sarah Braddock,
Neel Patel, and Hillary Park

46:53.060 --> 46:56.355
and Special Agent in Charge
Austin Ramey from the DEA.

46:56.355 --> 46:59.108
Also present in the courtroom,
Zachary Hernandez,

46:59.108 --> 47:02.320
Special Agent in Charge
of the FBI in New Mexico.

47:02.320 --> 47:05.323
Your Honor, I'd also like to
note the presence of the victims

47:05.323 --> 47:10.536
who are here this morning,
Marie Schrader and Blanca Gomez.

47:13.872 --> 47:16.584
William Oakley appearing
as advisory counsel.

47:16.584 --> 47:19.211
Saul Goodman appearing
on his own behalf.

47:19.211 --> 47:21.005
Good morning.

47:21.005 --> 47:24.801
The defendant still wants
to represent himself?

47:24.801 --> 47:26.885
That's right, Your Honor.

47:26.885 --> 47:28.554
Okay.

47:31.474 --> 47:33.685
The parties have reached
a plea agreement

47:33.685 --> 47:35.478
satisfactory to both sides.

47:35.478 --> 47:37.271
However, I have reviewed

47:37.271 --> 47:39.856
the government's sentencing
recommendations

47:39.856 --> 47:43.194
and, well, I have questions.

47:43.194 --> 47:47.031
Mr. Castellano, will you please
come up to the microphone?

47:54.038 --> 47:57.583
Mr. Castellano, today,
we consider the sentence

47:57.583 --> 48:00.336
for a defendant
who will be pleading guilty

48:00.336 --> 48:03.506
to multiple felonies,
RICO offenses,

48:03.506 --> 48:05.466
money laundering conspiracy,

48:05.466 --> 48:09.928
accessory after the fact to
the murder of federal officers.

48:11.305 --> 48:13.140
And for these offenses,

48:13.140 --> 48:16.352
the government's
sentencing recommendation

48:16.352 --> 48:19.271
is seven years.
I can assure you,

48:19.271 --> 48:21.399
my colleagues
and I gave every aspect

48:21.399 --> 48:24.402
of this recommendation
careful consideration.

48:24.402 --> 48:27.697
Help me understand.
Has the defendant provided

48:27.697 --> 48:29.741
substantial assistance
to the government?

48:29.741 --> 48:31.033
Your Honor.

48:31.033 --> 48:33.411
Mr. Oakley,
please advise your client

48:33.411 --> 48:35.204
to stay silent at this time.

48:35.204 --> 48:38.416
Your Honor, with respect,
Mr. Oakley is advisory counsel.

48:38.416 --> 48:40.752
I'm representing myself
here today.

48:40.752 --> 48:43.755
If I may say something
that I think will help the court

48:43.755 --> 48:45.715
fully understand the situation.

48:45.715 --> 48:47.091
Mr. Goodman.

48:47.091 --> 48:50.135
You are the beneficiary
of the most generous

48:50.135 --> 48:53.264
sentencing recommendation I've
seen in 22 years on the bench.

48:53.264 --> 48:57.017
Any statement you make
imperils that recommendation.

48:57.017 --> 48:59.353
I'm very aware of that,
Your Honor.

48:59.353 --> 49:01.355
If you'll allow me to speak,
I...

49:01.355 --> 49:04.483
I think I can save
the court's valuable time.

49:07.612 --> 49:10.239
Go ahead, briefly.

49:24.712 --> 49:27.924
Two years ago,
a man came into my office,

49:27.924 --> 49:30.802
he said his name was Mayhew.

49:30.802 --> 49:35.180
He wanted one of my clients
to lie for him under oath.

49:35.180 --> 49:37.057
He offered me money.

49:37.057 --> 49:39.393
I refused.

49:39.393 --> 49:43.773
That night as I was leaving
my office, I was attacked.

49:43.773 --> 49:46.484
A bag was shoved over my head.

49:46.484 --> 49:49.612
I was hogtied. I was driven
out into the desert.

49:49.612 --> 49:51.530
And when they pulled
the hood off,

49:51.530 --> 49:53.574
I was kneeling
in front of an open grave

49:53.574 --> 49:56.201
with a gun pointed at my head.

49:56.201 --> 49:59.497
That was my introduction
to Walter White.

50:00.997 --> 50:02.750
I was terrified.

50:08.255 --> 50:09.757
But not for long.

50:12.718 --> 50:14.846
That night I saw opportunity.

50:15.930 --> 50:17.932
A shot at big money,

50:17.932 --> 50:20.893
and I grabbed it
and I held it tight.

50:20.893 --> 50:24.271
And for the next 16 months,

50:24.271 --> 50:26.941
my every waking moment
was spent building

50:26.941 --> 50:28.776
Walter White's drug empire.

50:28.776 --> 50:31.988
Hold on, Mr. Goodman,
stop right there.

50:31.988 --> 50:34.573
Consult Mr. Oakley
before you say another word.

50:34.573 --> 50:38.034
Your Honor, I believe the court
deserves the whole truth.

50:38.034 --> 50:42.456
You are contradicting your plea
agreement's sworn factual basis.

50:42.456 --> 50:44.000
No offense, Your Honor,

50:44.000 --> 50:46.251
but I think I know the law here
better than you do.

50:46.251 --> 50:48.379
Your Honor, we'd like
to request a recess.

50:48.379 --> 50:50.006
We do not need a recess.

50:50.006 --> 50:53.009
We are satisfied
for Mr. Goodman to continue.

50:53.009 --> 50:56.679
Your Honor, I'd like to petition
to withdraw from this case.

50:56.679 --> 50:57.763
Denied.

50:57.763 --> 51:00.265
Respectfully--
Not a chance.

51:03.853 --> 51:06.104
Bobbi, swear Mr. Goodman in.

51:10.026 --> 51:11.903
Do you swear
that the evidence

51:11.903 --> 51:13.988
you shall give to the court
in this matter

51:13.988 --> 51:15.614
shall be the truth,
the whole truth,

51:15.614 --> 51:17.783
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

51:17.783 --> 51:19.744
I do.

51:19.744 --> 51:22.078
Mr. Goodman,
you are now under oath.

51:23.622 --> 51:25.416
Any false statement you make

51:25.416 --> 51:27.793
can be used
in prosecution for perjury,

51:27.793 --> 51:29.670
or obstruction of justice.

51:29.670 --> 51:32.339
Do you understand?
Yes.

51:32.339 --> 51:33.799
All right.

51:33.799 --> 51:35.676
In the last 24 hours,
have you used

51:35.676 --> 51:38.387
any alcohol or other drugs?
No, Your Honor.

51:38.387 --> 51:40.806
Are you taking
any prescription medications?

51:40.806 --> 51:42.307
No.

51:42.307 --> 51:43.559
All right.

51:44.727 --> 51:46.604
Continue.

51:53.652 --> 51:55.696
Oh, um...

51:55.696 --> 51:59.324
I lied to the government
about Kim Wexler.

51:59.324 --> 52:03.996
Uh, I fed them a load of BS
about her involvement

52:03.996 --> 52:06.164
in Howard Hamlin's murder.
I just...

52:06.164 --> 52:08.292
I just wanted her
to come here today.

52:08.292 --> 52:10.335
I wanted her to hear this.

52:14.339 --> 52:16.717
So yeah, I wasn't there
when the meth was cooked.

52:16.717 --> 52:18.886
I wasn't there
when it was sold.

52:18.886 --> 52:20.638
I didn't witness
any of the murders,

52:20.638 --> 52:22.723
but I damn well knew
what was happening.

52:22.723 --> 52:25.517
I was more
than a willing participant.

52:25.517 --> 52:27.269
I was indispensable.

52:27.269 --> 52:28.938
I kept Walter White
out of jail.

52:28.938 --> 52:31.649
I laundered his money.
I lied for him.

52:31.649 --> 52:35.319
I conspired with him
and I made millions.

52:36.737 --> 52:39.615
If he hadn't walked
into my office that day,

52:39.615 --> 52:42.076
Walter White would have
been dead

52:42.076 --> 52:44.787
or behind bars within a month.

52:46.998 --> 52:50.126
And Agent Schrader
and Agent Gomez

52:50.126 --> 52:53.838
and a whole lot of other people
would still be alive.

52:56.381 --> 52:59.175
Fact is, Walter White
couldn't have done it

52:59.175 --> 53:00.845
without me.

53:03.055 --> 53:04.306
You got that?

53:05.474 --> 53:07.018
We move to strike

53:07.018 --> 53:08.310
Mr. Goodman's comments.

53:08.310 --> 53:10.354
On what grounds?
Uh, speculation.

53:10.354 --> 53:13.691
Speculation? He's testifying
to his own actions.

53:13.691 --> 53:16.318
Your Honor, uh,
he's describing events

53:16.318 --> 53:18.445
that would have transpired
had he acted differently.

53:18.445 --> 53:21.032
I have one more thing to say.
Sit down, Mr. Goodman.

53:21.032 --> 53:22.950
Please, Your Honor. Please.
Now.

53:22.950 --> 53:25.077
The government
urges the court

53:25.077 --> 53:26.912
to allow Mr. Goodman
to continue.

53:26.912 --> 53:28.998
How is that not speculation?

53:34.252 --> 53:36.380
All right, Mr. Goodman.

53:36.380 --> 53:37.464
Go ahead.

53:41.802 --> 53:44.346
What happened
to Howard Hamlin,

53:44.346 --> 53:46.515
it was...

53:46.515 --> 53:47.850
It was...

53:50.853 --> 53:52.771
I can't even...

53:56.942 --> 54:02.573
After that,
Kim had the guts to start over.

54:02.573 --> 54:05.241
She left town. But...

54:07.536 --> 54:09.413
I'm the one who ran away.

54:14.210 --> 54:16.045
And my brother Chuck.

54:17.379 --> 54:20.091
Uh, Charles McGill.

54:20.091 --> 54:21.800
You may have known him.

54:24.428 --> 54:26.597
He was an incredible lawyer,

54:26.597 --> 54:29.808
the most brilliant guy
I ever met.

54:29.808 --> 54:30.976
But he was limited.

54:32.352 --> 54:33.687
I tried.

54:35.147 --> 54:37.566
I could have tried harder.

54:39.068 --> 54:40.569
I should have.

54:42.613 --> 54:44.782
Instead--
Your Honor--

54:44.782 --> 54:49.078
Bill, please.
Just let me get through this.

54:49.078 --> 54:52.206
Instead, when I saw
a chance to hurt him,

54:52.206 --> 54:53.665
I took it.

54:57.128 --> 55:01.132
I got his malpractice insurance
canceled.

55:01.132 --> 55:05.052
I took away the one thing
he lived for: the law.

55:08.013 --> 55:10.182
After that, he killed himself.

55:16.939 --> 55:18.690
And I'll live with that.

55:29.285 --> 55:31.162
What was all that?

55:31.162 --> 55:34.498
That thing with your brother,
that wasn't even a crime.

55:34.498 --> 55:36.583
Yeah, it was.
Mr. Goodman.

55:36.583 --> 55:40.004
Sit down and stay seated.

55:40.004 --> 55:42.380
The name's McGill.

55:42.380 --> 55:44.091
I'm James McGill.

55:45.801 --> 55:47.385
Your Honor, in view

55:47.385 --> 55:49.847
of the defendant's confession...
We'd like a recess.

55:49.847 --> 55:51.765
Hold on.
That was not a confession.

55:51.765 --> 55:54.935
...urges this court to impose
the statutory maximum...

55:54.935 --> 55:58.605
It was merely a point of view
in a very complex narrative.

55:58.605 --> 56:01.525
...to assess the additional
claims Mr. Goodman--

56:01.525 --> 56:03.777
I'm sorry, Mr. McGill
has now admitted to,

56:03.777 --> 56:06.030
including perjury
on this court.

56:14.412 --> 56:16.623
Yes, I did.

56:16.623 --> 56:18.709
Oh, crap.

56:29.553 --> 56:31.263
I was starting to worry.

56:31.263 --> 56:33.431
My car conked out on I-40.

56:33.431 --> 56:35.934
I almost got creamed
by a cement truck.

56:42.774 --> 56:47.445
Oh, um, they had
those apples that you like.

56:47.445 --> 56:49.865
I got you half a dozen Fuji.

56:49.865 --> 56:53.369
Um, and the newsstand
on Central said

56:53.369 --> 56:55.954
they might start carrying
the<i>Financial Times.</i>

56:55.954 --> 56:57.748
So that's good, right?

57:10.677 --> 57:11.929
What?

57:11.929 --> 57:14.223
You know I could
hire someone to do this.

57:14.223 --> 57:16.432
I could get someone
from the office.

57:16.432 --> 57:18.310
I'm doing it.

57:18.310 --> 57:19.895
Yeah, every day?

57:19.895 --> 57:22.940
While you're trying
to start a practice?

57:22.940 --> 57:25.150
Why?

57:26.610 --> 57:28.987
Because you're my brother, duh.

57:28.987 --> 57:30.446
You'd do the same for me.

57:33.784 --> 57:37.121
Well, you could stay
for a while. We could talk.

57:37.121 --> 57:39.290
Talk. What about?

57:41.333 --> 57:43.335
Your cases, your clients?

57:43.335 --> 57:46.088
<i>You</i> want to talk
about<i>my</i> clients?

57:46.088 --> 57:49.341
Heh, seriously, you want
to talk about, uh, the granny

57:49.341 --> 57:51.802
who got picked up
for soliciting

57:51.802 --> 57:54.346
inside a Christian Science
Reading Room?

57:54.346 --> 57:56.848
What about the kid
who broke into a liquor store

57:56.848 --> 57:59.184
and drank five bottles
of crème de menthe

57:59.184 --> 58:00.894
and then passed out
behind the counter?

58:00.894 --> 58:04.522
They deserve a vigorous defense
like any other client.

58:06.024 --> 58:08.860
Or maybe you just want
to tell me what I'm doing wrong.

58:08.860 --> 58:10.946
That's not what I had in mind.

58:22.416 --> 58:25.877
I'm hoping you didn't steal that
from a motel ice machine.

58:25.877 --> 58:31.591
You know, I'm gonna take a pass
on the heart-to-heart, Chuck.

58:31.591 --> 58:37.014
One of my deserving clients,
he got caught waving the weenie

58:37.014 --> 58:39.433
outside of Hobby Lobby.

58:39.433 --> 58:41.852
Hold on,
you gotta reimburse yourself.

58:41.852 --> 58:45.605
Mm, this one's on me.
Jimmy.

58:47.483 --> 58:49.401
If you don't like
where you're heading,

58:49.401 --> 58:53.155
there's no shame in going back
and changing your path.

58:55.157 --> 58:58.494
Oh, when have you
ever changed your path?

59:02.580 --> 59:04.375
Hey, think on it.

59:04.375 --> 59:08.128
We always end up having
the same conversation, don't we?

59:10.464 --> 59:11.882
I'll see you tomorrow, Chuck.

59:11.882 --> 59:14.801
And I might have
the<i>Financial Times.</i>

1:01:03.285 --> 1:01:04.702
I know you?

1:01:19.801 --> 1:01:20.927
Hey.

1:01:22.179 --> 1:01:25.641
"Better call Saul," right?

1:01:28.268 --> 1:01:29.311
McGill.

1:01:29.311 --> 1:01:31.229
What?

1:01:31.229 --> 1:01:33.649
I'm McGill.

1:01:35.066 --> 1:01:37.194
Don't give me that.

1:01:37.194 --> 1:01:38.736
You're Saul.

1:01:41.031 --> 1:01:44.201
Hey, it's Better Call Saul.

1:01:46.537 --> 1:01:47.663
No shit.

1:01:48.913 --> 1:01:51.166
Psst, psst!

1:01:51.166 --> 1:01:52.709
Back here, yo.

1:01:56.712 --> 1:01:58.756
Back here.

1:02:05.681 --> 1:02:08.350
See? Told you.

1:02:08.350 --> 1:02:10.018
It's Better Call Saul.

1:02:10.018 --> 1:02:12.812
All right. Better Call Saul.

1:02:13.730 --> 1:02:14.898
Hey.

1:02:14.898 --> 1:02:16.483
Yeah.

1:02:16.483 --> 1:02:18.026
Better Call Saul.

1:02:19.944 --> 1:02:23.615
Better Call Saul.

1:02:24.866 --> 1:02:29.705
Better Call Saul.

1:02:31.331 --> 1:02:35.460
PRISONERS

1:02:36.752 --> 1:02:46.304
<i>Better Call Saul.</i>

1:02:43.093 --> 1:02:46.304
Shut up!

1:02:46.304 --> 1:02:49.140
<i>Better Call Saul.</i>
I said, shut up.

1:02:49.140 --> 1:02:52.227
<i>Better Call Saul.</i>
Shut the hell up.

1:02:52.227 --> 1:02:55.272
<i>Better Call Saul.</i>
Shut up now!

1:02:55.272 --> 1:02:57.982
<i>Better Call Saul.</i>
Shut up!

1:02:57.982 --> 1:02:59.150
<i>Better Call...</i>

1:03:19.630 --> 1:03:21.131
Saul.

1:03:21.131 --> 1:03:22.591
Lawyer's here.

1:03:26.637 --> 1:03:28.430
I got you, Saul.

1:03:54.289 --> 1:03:56.667
Ma'am.
No cuffs, please.

1:04:05.133 --> 1:04:06.468
Thank you.

1:04:17.228 --> 1:04:18.605
Hi, Jimmy.

1:04:22.066 --> 1:04:23.360
Hi.

1:04:26.196 --> 1:04:27.698
How did you...?

1:04:27.698 --> 1:04:30.784
Uh, turns out
my New Mexico bar card

1:04:30.784 --> 1:04:33.077
doesn't have
an expiration date.

1:05:41.813 --> 1:05:44.315
You had them down
to seven years.

1:05:46.359 --> 1:05:47.985
Yeah, I did.

1:05:57.161 --> 1:05:58.914
Eighty-six years.

1:06:07.631 --> 1:06:09.424
Eighty-six years.

1:06:19.684 --> 1:06:21.436
But...

1:06:21.436 --> 1:06:25.398
with good behavior,
who knows?

1:07:49.148 --> 1:07:51.275
Hey, here we go,
here we go.

1:08:09.502 --> 1:08:11.087
Check him.
