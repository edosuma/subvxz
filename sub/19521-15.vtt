- Well, a record 41 athletes

02:59.547 --> 03:01.280

03:01.282 --> 03:03.815

Our ninjas will have
just four minutes

03:08.589 --> 03:10.956
to complete
this difficult course.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.058
<i>It starts with the very tricky
Giant Ring Swing.</i>

03:13.060 --> 03:15.827
<i>Competitors will have to
swing out and snag their ring</i>

03:15.829 --> 03:17.729
<i>on a hook, leap a 7-foot gap,</i>

03:17.731 --> 03:21.200
<i>then swing 18 feet
to the narrow landing pad.</i>

03:21.202 --> 03:23.035
<i>Then they'll face an iconic
obstacle</i>

03:23.037 --> 03:24.536
<i>with a tough new twist</i>

03:24.538 --> 03:26.638
<i>at the Criss Cross
Salmon Ladder.</i>

03:26.640 --> 03:29.007
<i>Finalists have to jump
the bar up eight rungs,</i>

03:29.009 --> 03:31.877
<i>changing sides twice
on their way to the top.</i>

03:31.879 --> 03:33.545
<i>The Wave Runner is back.</i>

03:33.547 --> 03:36.481
<i>Athletes need a vise-like grip
and perfect balance</i>

03:36.483 --> 03:40.419
<i>to work their way across two
odd-shaped pivoting boards.</i>

03:40.421 --> 03:43.488
<i>If they survive, they'll face
the brand-new Swing Surfer,</i>

03:43.490 --> 03:46.358
<i>a 13-foot vault
onto a swinging pendulum</i>

03:46.360 --> 03:50.195
<i>followed by a 12-foot jump
to a rope on the other side,</i>

03:50.197 --> 03:53.532
<i>but the toughest test is still
to come down Wingnut Alley.</i>

03:53.534 --> 03:56.802
<i>It's a series of four rotating
bars that swing side-to-side</i>

03:56.804 --> 04:00.439
<i>and require laches up
to 12 feet.</i>

04:00.441 --> 04:02.074
<i>With the clock ticking down,</i>

04:02.076 --> 04:05.110
<i>anyone still standing needs
to push past the Wall Flip.</i>

04:05.112 --> 04:11.283
<i>This year the panels weigh
100, 125, and 150 pounds.</i>

04:11.285 --> 04:13.218

04:40.648 --> 04:42.314
<i>only a couple of months old,</i>

04:42.316 --> 04:45.684

<i>in the corner counting
down the four minutes.</i>

<i>without using up
a lot of time or strength.</i>

05:07.508 --> 05:09.908
<i>You can see how high
those hooks are,</i>

05:09.910 --> 05:12.878
<i>and now has this 18-foot
swing to the landing,</i>

05:12.880 --> 05:14.279

though;</i>

05:48.849 --> 05:51.983

<i>You got to take a flying leap
out and land on that pendulum.</i>

06:38.132 --> 06:40.699

<i>That ledge has only about
a foot wide.</i>

07:05.692 --> 07:08.693

the lower body too, to offload</i>

- Come on, Joe, you got it.

01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:46.060
<i>- Well, there are six hooks.</i>

01:22:46.062 --> 01:22:48.095
<i>It's a path about
15 feet long.</i>

01:22:48.097 --> 01:22:50.030
<i>- All right, he's on.
- He's on.</i>

01:22:50.032 --> 01:22:53.133
<i>- The fourth hook is higher
and off to the side.</i>

01:22:53.135 --> 01:22:56.070
<i>Oh, long reach,</i>

01:22:56.072 --> 01:22:57.471
<i>and a good save.</i>

01:22:57.473 --> 01:22:58.839
<i>Can he hold on?</i>

01:22:58.841 --> 01:23:02.576
- Oh, no!
- No!

01:23:02.578 --> 01:23:05.279
<i>Joe Moravsky, the Weatherman</i>

01:23:05.281 --> 01:23:09.149
<i>ends up wet
on stage three,</i>

01:23:09.151 --> 01:23:11.218
<i>the dream unrealized,</i>

01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:13.253
<i>and yet the man
who makes it farther</i>

01:23:13.255 --> 01:23:16.657
<i>than anyone in
an incredible season nine.</i>

01:23:16.659 --> 01:23:20.561
<i>- This was Joe Moravsky's
best run ever on stage three.</i>

01:23:20.563 --> 01:23:24.164
<i>He beat the Ultimate
Cliffhanger, the Body Prop,</i>

01:23:24.166 --> 01:23:26.700
<i>and the new obstacle,
the Peg Cloud,</i>

01:23:26.702 --> 01:23:29.603
<i>but at Time Bomb time ran out.</i>

01:23:29.605 --> 01:23:31.271
<i>He missed with his left hand,</i>

01:23:31.273 --> 01:23:33.574
<i>and then his grip
gave out on his right,</i>

01:23:33.576 --> 01:23:36.176
<i>but he makes it further
than anyone this year.</i>

01:23:36.178 --> 01:23:39.480
<i>- And Joe Moravsky getting
a well-deserved ovation</i>

01:23:39.482 --> 01:23:41.382
<i>after making it to the seventh</i>

01:23:41.384 --> 01:23:44.451
<i>of the eight obstacles
on stage three.</i>

01:23:44.453 --> 01:23:46.620
- I'm just thankful
for the opportunity.

01:23:46.622 --> 01:23:48.989
This is one of the coolest
playgrounds in the world.

01:23:50.192 --> 01:23:54.028
<i>- So that wraps up a dramatic
final night in Vegas.</i>

01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:57.831
<i>We started with 41 competitors
vying for a million dollars,</i>

01:23:57.833 --> 01:23:59.366
<i>but it didn't happen.</i>

01:23:59.368 --> 01:24:02.202
<i>Only three could move on
to stage three,</i>

01:24:02.204 --> 01:24:05.039
<i>and none could make it
to stage four.</i>

01:24:05.041 --> 01:24:06.907
<i>We'll have to wait
till next year</i>

01:24:06.909 --> 01:24:10.677
<i>to crown a new "American
Ninja Warrior" champion.</i>

01:24:10.679 --> 01:24:12.746
For Akbar Gbajabiamila
and Kristine Leahy,

01:24:12.748 --> 01:24:14.081
I'm Matt Iseman.

01:24:14.083 --> 01:24:17.618
We'll see you on next season
of "American Ninja Warrior."
