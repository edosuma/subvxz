09:23.564 --> 09:25.430
YOU SEE GEORGE SPARED
NO EXPENSE.

09:25.499 --> 09:27.165
[LAUGHTER]
- THEY HAD A BALCONY.

09:27.234 --> 09:27.966
THAT WAS A FIRE ESCAPE.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.968
WELL, THEY COULD BARBECUE.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.369
[LAUGHTER]

09:31.405 --> 09:33.438
IT RAINED THE FIRST FEW MONTHS
WE WERE THERE.

09:33.440 --> 09:34.906
[LAUGHS]

09:34.975 --> 09:36.974
IT WAS LIKE AN OLD FRIEND
COME TO VISIT.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.309
FELT LIKE I WAS
BACK IN IRELAND.

09:38.345 --> 09:41.179
- OH, DARLING.
- A YEAR LATER, BRIDGET WESTON WAS BORN.

09:41.248 --> 09:45.383
[THUNDER]
[BABY CRYING]

09:45.419 --> 09:48.453
NOT WASTING ANY TIME,
KEVIN WESTON, HEIR TO THE THRONE,

09:48.588 --> 09:49.988
ARRIVED 10 MONTHS LATER.

09:50.057 --> 09:53.324
WHY AM I THE ALIEN
AND YOU GET FIREWORKS, KEVIN?

09:53.327 --> 09:54.792
- IT'S HIS MOVIE.
- HA HA!

09:54.861 --> 09:58.063
LIKE COLUMBIA RIVER SALMON,
THE WESTONS' LIFE WAS UPSTREAM,

09:58.198 --> 09:59.998
BUT THEY NEVER
LET IT GET THEM DOWN.

10:00.067 --> 10:02.400
GEORGE GOT A JOB AT THE BANK... [BELLS
RINGING] [CASH REGISTER BELL RINGS]

10:02.469 --> 10:04.869
AND SOON THEY COULD AFFORD
MORE THAN A LUMP OF COAL

10:05.005 --> 10:06.604
IN THEIR STOCKINGS AT CHRISTMAS.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.406
- YAY!
- LOOK AT THAT.

10:08.475 --> 10:10.341
GEORGE HAD A PAPER ROUTE
BY THE TIME HE WAS 9.

10:10.377 --> 10:11.743
A MORNING AND EVENING ROUTE.

10:11.812 --> 10:12.743
- PLEASE.
- YES.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.213
THE YEARS WENT BY.
MAGGIE'S GARDEN GREW

10:15.282 --> 10:16.815
AND SO DID GEORGE'S JOB
AT THE BANK.

10:16.817 --> 10:20.085
HE BECAME A LOAN OFFICER.

10:20.220 --> 10:23.554
MAGGIE SAW BRIDGET OFF
TO HER PROM.

10:23.590 --> 10:25.556
AFTER THE KIDS GRADUATED
HIGH SCHOOL

10:25.592 --> 10:26.825
AND WENT OFF TO COLLEGE,

10:26.827 --> 10:28.693
MAGGIE OPENED A NURSERY

10:28.762 --> 10:30.662
AND DAD BECAME A VICE PRESIDENT.

10:32.766 --> 10:37.435
WHEN THE KIDS ARE AWAY,
THE PARENTS CAN PLAY.

10:37.471 --> 10:38.770
THERE'S NO STOPPING
GEORGE AND MAGGIE WESTON,

10:38.905 --> 10:44.109
TOGETHER FOR 20 YEARS,
LOOKING FORWARD TO 20 MORE.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.645
MOM AND DAD, LONG MAY YOU WAVE.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.980
HA HA HA!
[APPLAUSE]

10:49.049 --> 10:51.583
- LIGHTS!
- WHOO WHOO WHOO WHOO!

10:53.186 --> 10:55.386
MOM AND DAD, YOU'RE THE BEST.

10:55.389 --> 10:56.921
YOU BOTH SACRIFICE
A LOT OVER THE YEARS

10:57.057 --> 10:58.256
TO RAISE KEVIN AND ME,

10:58.391 --> 10:59.858
AND WE WANT TO GIVE
YOU SOMETHING.

10:59.993 --> 11:03.928
SO GRANDMA AND GRANDPA,
GRANNY AND SEAN,

11:03.997 --> 11:05.864
WE ALL PITCHED IN
TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING

11:05.999 --> 11:08.666
THAT IS LONG OVERDUE.

11:08.702 --> 11:09.867
A SECOND HONEYMOON!

11:09.903 --> 11:13.404
[ALL CHEERING]

11:13.473 --> 11:16.273
5 DAYS ON THE SUNNY ISLAND
OF MANZANILLA,

11:16.309 --> 11:17.875
ALL EXPENSES PAID
AND NON-REFUNDABLE, DAD.

11:17.911 --> 11:20.878
MARGARITA NIGHTS
AND COCONUT DREAMS

11:20.947 --> 11:22.480
ON DORADO BEACH.

11:22.549 --> 11:24.949
BETTER START PACKING.
YOU LEAVE TOMORROW NIGHT ON THE RED-EYE.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.218
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I CAN'T GO TOMORROW

11:27.353 --> 11:29.020
BECAUSE I HAVE
A BOARD MEETING ON WEDNESDAY.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.755
IT'S ALL
TAKEN CARE OF, GEORGE.

11:30.757 --> 11:32.356
LOIS IS GONNA STAND IN FOR YOU.

11:32.426 --> 11:34.892
UH, YEAH, BUT I HAVE NO ONE
TO COVER FOR ME AT THE NURSERY.

11:34.961 --> 11:36.026
WHAT DO YOU THINK
MOTHERS ARE FOR?

11:36.063 --> 11:37.962
- OH, MOM.
- ISN'T IT ROMANTIC?

11:37.964 --> 11:41.299
- YEAH.
- [LAUGHS]

11:42.736 --> 11:44.369
WHOO-HOO!

11:44.371 --> 11:46.370
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
WE CAN'T JUST TELL EVERYBODY

11:46.440 --> 11:48.305
THAT WE'RE SEPARATING
AND GET A REFUND.

11:48.341 --> 11:49.907
BECAUSE IT'S NON-REFUNDABLE.
REMEMBER?

11:49.943 --> 11:52.977
YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW,
WE COULD AFFORD

11:53.013 --> 11:55.446
TO GO ANYWHERE WE WANT TO,
ANYTIME WE WANT TO,

11:55.449 --> 11:57.648
BUT ALL YOU EVER DO IS WORK.

11:57.684 --> 11:59.250
YEAH, WELL...

11:59.385 --> 12:01.185
I'M NOT GONNA BE WORKING
THE NEXT 5 DAYS.

12:01.254 --> 12:02.987
I'M GONNA BE WINDSURFING.

12:04.725 --> 12:06.124
THESE KIDS THINK OF EVERYTHING.

12:06.126 --> 12:08.960
THEY GOT ME WINDSURFING LESSONS
AND YOU SCUBA LESSONS.

12:13.033 --> 12:16.467
IT'S JUST THAT A HONEYMOON
IS MEANT TO BE ROMANTIC.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.336
DON'T START ON OUR
SEX LIFE, MAGGIE.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.538
WHAT SEX LIFE, GEORGE?
WE DON'T HAVE A SEX LIFE.

12:20.607 --> 12:20.739
THERE YOU GO.

12:23.977 --> 12:27.745
LOOK, WAIT A MINUTE.
IF WE GO TO MANZANILLA,

12:27.748 --> 12:30.014
NOBODY HAS TO KNOW WHAT WE DO
ONCE WE GET THERE, RIGHT?

12:30.016 --> 12:32.150
WHY DON'T WE TAKE
SEPARATE VACATIONS?

12:32.219 --> 12:34.352
I MEAN, YOU GO YOUR WAY
AND I'LL GO MY WAY.

12:34.487 --> 12:37.421
ALL WE HAVE TO DO TOGETHER
IS GET ON THAT PLANE.

12:37.457 --> 12:40.058
- SEPARATE VACATIONS?
- YEAH.

12:43.029 --> 12:44.362
MIGHT WORK.

12:45.232 --> 12:46.498
[CAR HORN HONKS] - ALL RIGHT.
I GOT IT.

12:46.633 --> 12:48.166
I GOT IT.
I GOT IT.

12:48.168 --> 12:52.170
OK. UHH.
OHH. MAGGIE.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.740
WHAT IS IN HERE? UHH.

12:57.977 --> 13:01.779
[GRUNTING]

13:01.782 --> 13:02.847
SEAN AND I ARE
WAITING IN THE CAR.

13:02.849 --> 13:04.783
WE'LL BE RIGHT OUT, MOM.

13:04.918 --> 13:05.983
WHAT IS IT?

13:06.019 --> 13:07.986
IT'S INCENSE.
BRIDGET GAVE IT TO ME.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.253
NO, MAGGIE.
DON'T BRING THAT.

13:09.322 --> 13:10.455
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA USE IT.

13:10.457 --> 13:13.725
SEPARATE VACATIONS, GEORGE.
COMPRENDE?

13:15.796 --> 13:17.962
COMPRENDE.

13:46.693 --> 13:53.364
"SENOR NO ES MI ESPOSO.
HE IS NOT MY HUSBAND."

13:53.400 --> 14:01.406
"LA CARNE ESTA DEMESAIDA ECHA.
THE MEAT IS OVERDONE."

14:03.109 --> 14:05.309
THEY HAVEN'T COME UP
FOR AIR ONCE.

14:05.378 --> 14:08.846
THEY DON'T NEED AIR, GEORGE.
THEY'RE YOUNG AND IN LOVE.

14:08.882 --> 14:11.082
NEXT.

14:16.056 --> 14:19.590
LET'S SEE. WESTON.

14:19.659 --> 14:21.350
THE HONEYMOON PACKAGE.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.792
ARE YOU GUYS NEWLYWEDS, TOO?

14:23.842 --> 14:27.139
- NO, NOT REALLY.
- OH, OUR KIDS GAVE US A VACATION.

14:27.189 --> 14:30.031
- A SECOND HONEYMOON?
- AWW.

14:30.081 --> 14:32.998
THAT IS SO COOL.
BRAD LUCKINBILL.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.792
THIS IS MY WIFE JENNIFER.

14:35.842 --> 14:37.651
JENNIFER LUCKINBILL.

14:37.701 --> 14:40.160
- MAGGIE WESTON.
- GEORGE. GLAD TO MEET YOU.

14:40.210 --> 14:41.624
ARE YOU GUYS
GOING TO MANZANILLA?

14:41.674 --> 14:43.331
- DORADO BEACH.
- OH, WE ARE, TOO!

14:43.381 --> 14:44.676
CAN'T WAIT.

14:44.726 --> 14:47.548
EXCUSE ME, MR. AND
MRS. WESTON, I'M SORRY,

14:47.598 --> 14:50.712
BUT THE FLIGHT FROM SEATTLE TO
SAN JUAN IS COMPLETELY BOOKED.

14:50.762 --> 14:52.431
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T SEAT
THE TWO OF YOU TOGETHER.

14:52.481 --> 14:54.840
BUT I'M SURE THAT ONCE YOU GET
ON BOARD, YOU CAN SWITCH SEATS.

14:54.890 --> 14:56.256
- DON'T WORRY. IT'S FINE, REALLY.
- NO PROBLEM.

14:56.306 --> 14:58.029
THAT'S OK?
YOU'RE SO NICE.

14:58.031 --> 15:00.365
OK, AND I'M SURE
THE AIRLINE CHARTER

15:00.500 --> 15:01.699
SERVICING YOUR CONNECTION
TO MANZANILLA

15:01.834 --> 15:02.767
WILL BE ABLE TO
SEAT YOU TOGETHER.

15:02.902 --> 15:06.137
WE'LL KEEP OUR FINGERS
CROSSED. THANK YOU.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.176
- MM.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.311
ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU NEED?

15:13.446 --> 15:16.981
UH, YES, BUT I'M AFRAID
YOU CAN'T HELP ME.

15:19.586 --> 15:20.852
NEXT.

15:20.854 --> 15:23.421
HI. WE'RE GOING
TO MANZANILLA.

15:53.954 --> 15:56.120
HELLO, SENOR.

16:32.725 --> 16:33.024
THIS WAY, PLEASE.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.927
MAYBE THE KIDS GOT US A LIMO.

16:36.062 --> 16:38.529
HA HA!

16:38.598 --> 16:40.131
SENOR RIVERA, THERE MUST BE
SOME MISTAKE.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.732
WE ARE NOT DRUG DEALERS.

16:41.735 --> 16:44.402
WE'VE BEEN MARRIED 20 YEARS.
WE'RE ON OUR SECOND HONEYMOON.

16:44.471 --> 16:48.139
MM. JASMINE. HA HA HA.
SOOTHING FOR THE NERVES, HUH?

16:48.208 --> 16:51.542
EXCELLENT AFTER A STRESSFUL DAY.
INCENSE.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.143
MY DAUGHTER GAVE IT TO ME
FOR THE TRIP.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.678
BUT WE HAVE NO VIDA LOCA
IN MANZANILLA.

16:54.748 --> 16:59.416
HERE EVERYONE IS, LIKE YOU SAY IN
YOUR COUNTRY, KEEPING IT REAL.

16:59.452 --> 16:59.751
GET THE LUGGAGE.

17:01.855 --> 17:04.288
MY APOLOGIES, MRS. WESTON, HUH?

17:04.357 --> 17:06.690
PLEASE EXCUSE THE ZEAL
OF MY OFFICERS

17:06.760 --> 17:09.426
AND THE NOSES OF MY DOGS.

17:09.561 --> 17:11.628
NOW WE HAVE OUR FIRST STORY
TO TELL THE KIDS.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.431
A GOOD OUTLOOK FOR A WISE MAN.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.032
- THANK YOU, GENERAL.
- NO, PLEASE.

17:15.167 --> 17:17.702
I'M BUT A LOWLY CIVIL SERVANT.

17:17.837 --> 17:18.970
AND MRS. WESTON, MAY I SAY

17:18.972 --> 17:22.039
OUR HUMBLE ISLAND
IS FORTUNATE TO HAVE

17:22.108 --> 17:25.910
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL FLOWER
ADDED TO ITS GARDEN.

17:25.912 --> 17:29.647
OH. YOU CERTAINLY MAY.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.115
YEAH.

17:34.988 --> 17:40.124
GEORGE! OH!
OH, LOOK AT MY NEW SLIP.

17:40.259 --> 17:45.463
SOMEDAY THEY WILL TEACH A DOG
HOW TO INSPECT A LADY'S BAGS.

17:45.598 --> 17:46.797
UNTIL THEN, ALLOW ME.

17:46.833 --> 17:50.535
MY SISTERS WILL TAKE
[INDISTINCT]

17:50.670 --> 17:53.270
CARTE BLANCHE, TO A POINT.

17:53.339 --> 17:55.005
IT'S THE LEAST WE CAN DO.

17:55.075 --> 17:56.207
THANK YOU.

17:56.209 --> 17:57.608
OK, CAN WE LEAVE NOW?

17:57.644 --> 18:01.178
OF COURSE.
MY MAN WILL TAKE YOU TO YOUR HOTEL.

18:01.214 --> 18:03.280
SHOULD YOU NEED
ANY FURTHER ASSISTANCE,

18:03.349 --> 18:06.818
AN HELICOPTER RIDE, PERHAPS,
HERE, HERE.

18:06.953 --> 18:09.287
DO NOT HESITATE TO CALL, HUH?

18:10.623 --> 18:10.955
THANK YOU.

18:18.297 --> 18:20.831
CANNOT BELIEVE YOU LET
THAT GUY KISS YOUR HAND.

18:20.867 --> 18:24.768
IT'S THE CUSTOM.
IT WAS VERY SWEET.

18:24.838 --> 18:27.038
AND FRANKLY, IT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

18:27.040 --> 18:29.039
OH, OH, AND I SUPPOSE GETTING
BUSTED FOR DRUGS,

18:29.109 --> 18:29.974
THAT WAS NONE OF
MY BUSINESS, TOO.

18:30.043 --> 18:32.643
YOU KNOW, I DO THINK
THAT I TOLD YOU

18:32.645 --> 18:34.912
NOT TO BRING THAT INCENSE.

18:34.981 --> 18:37.115
OH, IT'S A CHARMING TOWN.

18:40.319 --> 18:41.852
OH, YES, LOOK--
WEDDINGS AND DIVORCES.

18:41.855 --> 18:44.455
FULL SERVICE DOWN HERE.

19:12.552 --> 19:15.620
GRACIAS. SHOCK ABSORBERS
WOULD BE NICE.

19:15.622 --> 19:20.624
OOH, THANK YOU.
OH, LOOK AT THIS LOVELY RESORT, GEORGE.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.293
THANK YOU.
YOU KNOW,

19:22.295 --> 19:24.829
AS SOON AS WE GET THE ROOMS
SQUARED AWAY,

19:24.831 --> 19:26.564
I'M GONNA GO STRAIGHT
TO THE BEACH.

19:26.566 --> 19:28.165
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TELL
ME WHERE WE'RE GOING, MAGGIE,

19:28.234 --> 19:29.767
BECAUSE WE'RE ON OUR
OWN NOW, REMEMBER?

19:29.836 --> 19:31.469
I WAS JUST TRYING TO--

19:33.573 --> 19:34.972
BE NICE.

19:42.915 --> 19:45.049
[SQUAWK]

19:55.128 --> 19:56.694
MM. IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

19:59.865 --> 20:00.998
BUT SENOR WESTON,
YOU HAVE OUR

20:01.067 --> 20:03.066
MOST LUXURIOUSLY APPOINTED
HONEYMOON SUITE.

20:03.102 --> 20:05.269
IT OVERLOOKS CORAZON ISLAND.
IT HAS ITS OWN JACUZZI.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.204
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T NEED
A JACUZZI.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.472
I NEED MY OWN ROOM.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.540
I'M AFRAID WE'RE BOOKED SOLID
FOR THE NIGHT.

20:10.577 --> 20:11.208
I CAN TRY TO MOVE YOU
IN THE MORNING,

20:11.244 --> 20:12.743
IF I GET A CANCELLATION.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.811
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WE NEED TO HAVE SEPARATE ROOMS.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.881
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A SUITE.

20:16.883 --> 20:20.751
IT COULD BE A SINGLE OVERLOOKING
THE CAR PARK. WE DON'T CARE.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.420
BUT WE HAVE NOTHING, SENORA.

20:22.555 --> 20:26.357
IF I MAY SUGGEST, I COULD HAVE A
ROLLAWAY BED SENT TO YOUR ROOM.

20:26.426 --> 20:28.825
I'M SORRY. THAT'S THE BEST
I CAN DO RIGHT NOW.

20:28.861 --> 20:30.228
FINE.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.831
YOU GOT ANY CALYPSO DANCES
OR LIMBO CONTESTS

20:34.867 --> 20:36.100
HERE AT THE HOTEL TONIGHT?

20:36.169 --> 20:37.768
WELL, LET'S SEE.
RICKY MARTIN JUST CHECKED OUT,

20:37.903 --> 20:40.638
JENNIFER LOPEZ IS ON VACATION,

20:40.640 --> 20:43.507
AND CHRISTINA AGUILERA WON'T BE
HERE UNTIL NEXT WEEK.

20:43.543 --> 20:46.510
BUT FOR YOU, WE DO HAVE KARAOKE
AT THE GARDENIA.

20:46.579 --> 20:46.777
THANK YOU.

20:48.981 --> 20:51.048
THANK YOU.

20:51.117 --> 20:52.483
GRACIAS, SENOR.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.786
TWO DOLLARS.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.255
HMM. SO?

20:57.390 --> 20:59.790
WELL, I FIGURE SINCE WE'RE
TAKING SEPARATE VACATIONS,

20:59.826 --> 21:01.859
WE SHOULD SPLIT EVERYTHING
50/50.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.194
FINE.

21:03.196 --> 21:05.395
"FOR THE HONEYMOONERS
WITH OUR COMPLIMENTS."

21:05.431 --> 21:06.596
LOOK, THEY GAVE US

21:32.461 --> 21:34.737
OK, MAGGIE.
WHEN YOU'RE READY,

21:34.787 --> 21:36.636
I THOUGHT WE MIGHT START
WITH A LITTLE SNORKELING

21:36.686 --> 21:37.622
TO GET YOU WARMED UP.

21:37.672 --> 21:39.678

THE SPORTS DESK ANYTIME.

21:39.728 --> 21:42.145

21:42.195 --> 21:44.713
SHALL I HAVE YOUR MEAL WAITING

21:44.763 --> 21:47.674
YES. WHY DON'T YOU
CHARGE IT TO THE ROOM

21:47.724 --> 21:49.995
AND TAKE A NICE, BIG TIP
FOR YOURSELF?

21:50.045 --> 21:50.508
THANK YOU.

21:51.444 --> 21:53.411
LET'S GO.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.185
EXCUSE ME. COULD I GET
A BEACH TOWEL HERE?

22:01.321 --> 22:04.054

22:04.057 --> 22:08.025
WESTON. GEORGE WESTON.
OH, A CLUB SODA.

22:08.961 --> 22:10.728
YOUR WIFE HAS A FOOD ORDER IN.

22:10.730 --> 22:13.597

HEY! ISN'T THIS PLACE GREAT?

22:43.296 --> 22:44.428

22:51.504 --> 22:53.036

OK, BUT JUST ONE.

22:55.041 --> 22:56.240

23:10.990 --> 23:15.860
HA HA HA!
THIS IS A GREAT BEACH.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.728
MM. THEY BLEACH THE SAND.

23:17.797 --> 23:18.929
REALLY?

23:18.931 --> 23:20.731
IT MUST COST A FORTUNE.

23:22.001 --> 23:24.334
BUT THIS PLACE
IS REALLY SOMETHING.

23:24.370 --> 23:25.936
I MEAN, EVERYONE IS GOING AROUND

23:26.071 --> 23:27.471
WITH A BIG SMILE ON THEIR FACE.

23:27.473 --> 23:30.207
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE EITHER
JUST MARRIED OR JUST DIVORCED.

23:30.342 --> 23:31.942
OH, SO BIG BUSINESS
DOWN HERE, HUH?

23:32.077 --> 23:33.677
MANZANILLA'S FAMOUS FOR IT.

23:33.813 --> 23:34.144
HA HA HA!

23:34.147 --> 23:35.012
OH. OHH.

23:35.147 --> 23:37.148

[WHIRRING]

23:37.283 --> 23:38.616
AH! I SET IT ON VIBRATE.

23:38.751 --> 23:43.220
IT'S MY MASSAGE.
THEY FIND YOU WHEREVER YOU ARE.

23:43.289 --> 23:44.955
KIND OF LIKE THE IRS.

23:44.957 --> 23:47.958
HA HA HA!
THAT'S FUNNY!

23:47.994 --> 23:48.959
YOU'RE CLEVER.

23:49.028 --> 23:50.760

23:50.797 --> 23:53.230
SMART AND FUNNY.

23:53.299 --> 23:56.734

23:59.972 --> 24:01.839

24:02.908 --> 24:05.909

24:05.978 --> 24:07.378
OH, NO, NO, NO.

24:07.380 --> 24:11.848
66.27 FOR A CLUB SODA
AND A SNACK? I DON'T THINK SO.

24:11.884 --> 24:14.384
BUT YOUR WIFE SAID
TO CHARGE IT.

24:14.420 --> 24:16.453
WHAT IS THAT?

24:16.522 --> 24:17.688
GUAVA GATEAU.

24:20.860 --> 24:23.427
MAGGIE IS OUT OF HER MIND.

24:25.331 --> 24:26.497
MAGGIE!

24:28.534 --> 24:29.933
MAGGIE.

24:30.002 --> 24:32.002
MAGGIE. MAGGIE.

24:35.074 --> 24:38.609
I JUST SIGNED A BILL FOR LUNCH.
$66.27.

24:38.611 --> 24:39.877
ARE YOU TRYING TO BREAK THE BANK
OUR FIRST DAY OUT?

24:40.012 --> 24:41.212
I DIDN'T PAY FOR IT.

24:41.347 --> 24:42.680
THE NURSERY'S A BUSINESS.
IT'S NOT A BLANK CHECK.

24:42.815 --> 24:46.350
GEORGE, WE ARE ON VACATION.
SEPARATE VACATIONS.

24:46.419 --> 24:47.484
SO SEPARATE.

24:47.520 --> 24:49.886
WELL, I COULD, IF I WASN'T
GETTING BUSTED FOR DRUGS

24:49.922 --> 24:51.688
AND HAVING TO SIGN

24:51.757 --> 24:54.024
EXCUSE ME, THE LADY IS
IN THE MIDDLE OF A LESSON.

24:54.159 --> 24:55.359
BACK OFF.
SHE'S MY WIFE.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.894
DON'T HIT HIM, PLEASE.
I'LL HAVE TO IDENTIFY THE BODY.

24:57.930 --> 24:59.229
OH, I SEE.
SO IF WE WEREN'T MARRIED,

24:59.265 --> 25:00.564
YOU'D LET THE GUY SLUG ME.

25:00.600 --> 25:03.167
- IS THAT IT?
- TONY, WE'LL FINISH TOMORROW, OK?

25:03.169 --> 25:05.436
- YEAH.

25:11.277 --> 25:14.778
RULE NUMBER 9, GEORGE.
RESPECT PERSONAL SPACE.

25:14.847 --> 25:17.314
RULE NUMBER 8-- COMMON GOALS.

25:17.316 --> 25:18.716
IT'S NOT YOUR MONEY
OR MY MONEY, MAGGIE.

25:18.851 --> 25:19.783
IT IS OUR MONEY.

25:19.919 --> 25:21.251
AND I'M SORRY TO BE
A DOWNER AND SPOIL

25:21.287 --> 25:22.586
YOUR CUDDLY SNORKEL OUT THERE,

25:22.622 --> 25:25.121
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE

25:25.157 --> 25:28.025
BREAKFAST IS INCLUDED, GEORGE.

25:29.862 --> 25:32.996
OH, BE A CHILD.
RUN AWAY.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.799
THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER HOTEL
ROOM ON THIS ISLAND SOMEWHERE.

25:35.835 --> 25:37.000
WELL, YOU'RE MISS MONEYBAGS.

25:37.036 --> 25:40.404
WHY DON'T YOU TRY
THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE?

25:42.341 --> 25:43.741
PASS ME MY SWEATER, WILL YOU?

25:45.077 --> 25:47.011
MY MOTHER GAVE YOU
THAT SWEATER.

25:47.146 --> 25:49.046
THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME.

25:55.187 --> 25:57.554
TIPS AND LUNCH.
YOU OWE ME ONE HALF OF $78.

25:57.590 --> 25:58.756
PUT IT ON MY TAB.

25:58.891 --> 26:01.892
THIS IS YOUR TAB, MAGGIE.
YOU CANNOT PUT A TAB ON A TAB.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.028
SAYS WHO? TAXI!

26:04.030 --> 26:06.496
OH, OH.
YOU'RE GONNA RUSH OFF IN THIS TAXI.

26:06.532 --> 26:08.098
YOU GOT NO IDEA
WHERE THE HELL YOU ARE.

26:08.134 --> 26:10.100
AND DRIVE AROUND ALL DAY
WITH THE METER RUNNING

26:10.235 --> 26:11.769
LOOKING FOR A ROOM SOMEPLACE.

26:11.771 --> 26:13.170
- IS THAT IT?
- DOWNTOWN, PLEASE.

26:13.305 --> 26:15.772
DOWNTOWN? THERE IS NO
DOWNTOWN HERE, MAGGIE.

26:15.841 --> 26:18.175
GEORGE, PEOPLE ARE STARING.

26:18.177 --> 26:20.110
OK, OK, YOU WANT TO BE
BY YOURSELF, MAGGIE? HUH?

26:20.245 --> 26:22.846
YOU WANT TO GO DOWNTOWN? OK. OK.

26:22.848 --> 26:25.916
I THINK IT'S TIME WE TAKE OFF
THE TRAINING WHEELS, MAGGIE.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.517
SEPARATION'S FOR SISSIES.

26:27.587 --> 26:28.953
I MEAN, WE'RE IN THE QUICKIE
CAPITAL OF THE WORLD.

26:31.724 --> 26:34.024
LET'S DO IT.
I WANT A DIVORCE.

26:34.793 --> 26:36.293
ANDALE.

26:56.015 --> 27:00.818
OH, MR. AND MRS. WESTON.

27:00.953 --> 27:03.354
IT IS YOU WHO SEEK A DIVORCE?

27:03.489 --> 27:04.287
YES, GENERAL.

27:04.323 --> 27:07.157
PLEASE, I AM BUT
A LOWLY MAGISTRATE.

27:07.159 --> 27:09.559
WHO THOUGHT YOU TWO WERE HERE
ON A SECOND HONEYMOON.

27:09.629 --> 27:11.828
AND WE THOUGHT YOU WERE
A CUSTOMS OFFICIAL.

27:11.897 --> 27:15.098
WELL, MANZANILLA
IS A SMALL ISLAND.

27:15.134 --> 27:17.768
A MAN WHO'S A [INDISTINCT]
MUST WEAR MANY HATS.

27:17.903 --> 27:19.436
PLEASE, SIT.

27:19.772 --> 27:21.772
SO IT WAS NOT TRUE,

27:21.907 --> 27:23.773
WHEN YOU SAID YOU WERE
HERE TO CELEBRATE

27:23.809 --> 27:26.310
20 WONDERFUL YEARS OF MARRIAGE.

27:26.445 --> 27:28.445
EVERYTHING THAT WE TOLD YOU
WAS TRUE.

27:28.481 --> 27:31.315
IT'S JUST THAT WE CAN'T
BE MARRIED ANYMORE.

27:31.317 --> 27:35.119
AND THIS IS INDEED
A SERIOUS MATTER.

27:35.254 --> 27:36.920
WHEN TWO PEOPLE
SUCH AS YOURSELVES

27:36.989 --> 27:39.122
CHOOSE TO REND THE BONDS
THAT HAVE HELD THEM

27:39.158 --> 27:41.191
TOGETHER FOR SO MANY YEARS,

27:41.193 --> 27:43.727
IT US NOT SOMETHING
TO ENTER INTO LIGHTLY.

27:44.897 --> 27:46.797
I ASSUME YOU HAVE
HAD COUNSELING.

27:46.866 --> 27:47.731
A YEAR WITH DR. BEEMAN.

27:47.800 --> 27:51.869
AH HA HA!
DR. BEEMAN.

27:51.871 --> 27:53.937
HAVE YOU SPOKEN
WITH YOUR PRIEST?

27:53.973 --> 27:57.875
ARE THESE QUESTIONS
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY?

27:57.877 --> 27:58.942
PERHAPS IT WOULD
BE WISE FOR YOU

27:59.011 --> 28:01.778
TO DISCUSS YOUR FEELINGS
FOR AN HOUR OR SO

28:01.814 --> 28:04.214

28:10.889 --> 28:14.291
NOW, WE HAVE DECIDED
WE WANT A DIVORCE.

28:14.360 --> 28:17.561
WELL, IN THAT CASE, I AM BOUND
BY THE LAWS OF MY COUNTRY

28:17.696 --> 28:18.629
TO GIVE YOU ONE.

28:18.764 --> 28:21.431
HERE WE ARE.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.967
I MUST ASK FOR YOUR SIGNATURES
ON THESE FORMS

28:24.003 --> 28:26.770
AND ONCE THEY'RE FILED,
YOUR DIVORCE WILL BE FINAL

28:26.905 --> 28:28.972
IN 48 HOURS.

28:28.974 --> 28:30.574
WE HEARD IT WAS ONE DAY.

28:30.643 --> 28:33.577
WELL, ACCORDING TO THE DISCRETION
OF THE COURT, MR. WESTON.

ENOUGH DIVERSION

28:37.750 --> 28:38.849
TO MAKE YOUR WAIT
A PLEASANT ONE.

I'LL TAKE A TAXI.

29:38.977 --> 29:40.844
COULD YOU MAYBE
RECOMMEND A HOTEL

29:40.979 --> 29:42.512
I COULD STAY IN TONIGHT?

29:42.515 --> 29:44.714
OF COURSE.
LET'S SEE.

29:45.284 --> 29:46.850
WE DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING IN TOWN

MRS. WESTON, AS YOUR SAFETY
IS MY PRIMARY CONCERN,

30:07.006 --> 30:11.875
I MUST RECOMMEND THAT YOU RETURN
TO DORADO BEACH.

30:11.877 --> 30:13.142
SHALL I CALL A CAR?

AND WHEN I WOKE UP, HE WAS GONE.

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:44.138
- SHOW ME, PLEASE.
- YEAH.

01:15:44.273 --> 01:15:48.209
IF YOU DON'T MIND MY ASKING,
WAS THERE A QUARREL?

01:15:48.211 --> 01:15:49.744
NO. WELL, YES, BUT--

01:15:49.879 --> 01:15:51.078
YOU ARGUED, PERHAPS?

01:15:51.213 --> 01:15:52.613
PLEASE, JUST FIND HIM.
HE MIGHT BE HURT.

01:15:52.615 --> 01:15:55.683
DON'T WORRY. WE WILL
PRAY TO SAINT JUDE FOR HIM.

01:15:56.853 --> 01:16:00.821
GEORGE IS OUT THERE SOMEWHERE.
I CAN'T JUST LEAVE.

01:16:00.857 --> 01:16:02.823
RAMON IS CALLING
THE HELICOPTER.

01:16:02.859 --> 01:16:05.292
THEY WILL SEARCH INTO THE NIGHT.

01:16:05.361 --> 01:16:07.227
WE MUST LEAVE
BEFORE IT GETS DARK.

01:16:07.263 --> 01:16:09.496
ONLY IF YOU PROMISE ME
YOU'LL FIND HIM.

01:16:09.532 --> 01:16:13.267
OF COURSE.
I PROMISE, BUT NOW PLEASE--

01:16:21.377 --> 01:16:23.510
WHERE ON EARTH COULD HE BE?

01:16:23.546 --> 01:16:25.646
[OINKING]

01:16:25.682 --> 01:16:28.515
NO, PIG! NO! NOT AGAIN.
GET BACK. BACK, BACK, BACK.

01:16:28.585 --> 01:16:32.986
GO AWAY. AAH! OH! MAGGIE!

01:16:33.022 --> 01:16:35.523
WHOA! GO. GO.

01:16:35.658 --> 01:16:39.126
HELP! UH UH UH! OH, MY GOD.

01:16:39.162 --> 01:16:41.195
OH, GOD. OH...

01:16:41.197 --> 01:16:43.797
MAGGIE! MAGGIE!

01:16:43.833 --> 01:16:47.735
OOH! MAGGIE!

01:16:47.737 --> 01:16:51.339
OH! OUCH! MAGGIE!

01:16:56.145 --> 01:16:57.944
SO YOU'RE NOT SURE
HOW HE FEELS,

01:16:57.981 --> 01:17:01.014
BUT YOU WANT TO GIVE IT
A CHANCE.

01:17:01.050 --> 01:17:02.749
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET A DIVORCE,

01:17:02.785 --> 01:17:04.619
AND YOU'RE ON THE PLANE
TOMORROW.

01:17:04.754 --> 01:17:07.821
YES. I THINK SO.

01:17:07.857 --> 01:17:10.224
I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND.

01:17:10.359 --> 01:17:14.628
YOU'RE IN LOVE
WITH YOUR HUSBAND.

01:17:14.664 --> 01:17:18.565
IT HAPPENS.

01:17:18.635 --> 01:17:19.767
YOU HAVE SOUL, PHILLIP.

01:17:19.836 --> 01:17:22.970
I THINK THAT'S WHAT ATTRACTED ME
TO YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE.

01:17:23.039 --> 01:17:25.506
NOT MY SMILE?

01:17:25.508 --> 01:17:29.243
WELL, THE SMILE
GOES WITHOUT SAYING,

01:17:29.245 --> 01:17:31.445
AND I HOPE YOU DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY,

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:33.914
BUT, YOU KNOW, THE FACT THAT YOU
WERE ATTRACTED TO ME,

01:17:33.916 --> 01:17:37.651
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW
HOW IMPORTANT THAT WAS.

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:43.424
MAGGIE, HOW COULD ANYBODY
NOT BE ATTRACTED TO YOU?

01:17:45.995 --> 01:17:48.963
DISFRUTA LA VIDA.

01:17:54.871 --> 01:17:57.805
I'LL HAVE
ANOTHER COCO LOCO, PLEASE.

01:17:57.874 --> 01:18:00.207
[CHUCKLES]

01:18:00.209 --> 01:18:01.742
SO TELL ME, GEORGE,

01:18:01.778 --> 01:18:04.544
WHEN WAS THE MOMENT YOU SAID,

01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:07.014
"HEY, THERE'S AN ELEPHANT IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE LIVING ROOM.

01:18:07.016 --> 01:18:09.817
WE NEED A DIVORCE"?

01:18:09.819 --> 01:18:11.418
GLORIA, I'M AN IDIOT.

01:18:11.421 --> 01:18:13.821
- OH, I THINK YOU'RE GREAT.
- OH, THANKS.

01:18:13.823 --> 01:18:16.290
THAT MEANS A LOT BECAUSE I HAD
MORE FUN WITH YOU THE OTHER DAY

01:18:16.425 --> 01:18:19.626
THAN I HAVE HAD IN YEARS,
AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

01:18:19.662 --> 01:18:21.028
- THAT'S A PROBLEM?
- YES.

01:18:21.097 --> 01:18:22.563
YOU SEE, I NEED TO HAVE FUN
WITH MY WIFE--

01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:26.767
MY EX-WIFE OR WHATEVER--
I MEAN, IF SHE'LL LET ME.

01:18:26.836 --> 01:18:28.869
TELL ME THIS IS MAKING SENSE.

01:18:28.871 --> 01:18:30.571
UH...IN A WAY.

01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:33.240
GLORIA, YOU ARE
AN EXTRAORDINARY WOMAN,

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:37.912
AND YOU WILL NEVER KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU HAVE CHANGED MY LIFE.

01:18:38.047 --> 01:18:42.083
GET A MASSAGE EVERY DAY
AND NEVER STOP WINDSURFING.

01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:48.321
20 BUCK TIP? GENEROUS GUY.

01:18:48.357 --> 01:18:51.525
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT
FROM A BANKER?

01:19:22.759 --> 01:19:25.025
[TELEPHONE RINGS]

01:19:25.061 --> 01:19:26.760
HA HA HA!

01:19:26.796 --> 01:19:30.164
HELLO? HELLO?

01:19:30.233 --> 01:19:32.833
OH, YES. OH. HEE HEE HEE!
THANK YOU, ANTONIO.

01:19:32.835 --> 01:19:34.769
OH, SAY HELLO FOR ME. OW.

01:19:34.904 --> 01:19:37.705
GEORGE, WE'RE GONNA
MISS OUR PLANE.

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:40.040
ANTONIO IS SENDING A CAR FOR US.

01:19:40.042 --> 01:19:42.376
WHAT TIME IS IT?

01:19:42.511 --> 01:19:45.312
HA HA HA!

01:19:48.184 --> 01:19:51.585
I DON'T FEEL DIVORCED...

01:19:51.621 --> 01:19:52.987
NEITHER DO I.

01:19:52.989 --> 01:19:56.590
AND I DON'T FEEL MARRIED,
EITHER.

01:19:56.659 --> 01:19:58.259
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

01:19:58.394 --> 01:20:00.727
BETTER.

01:20:00.797 --> 01:20:04.331
ME, TOO.

01:20:26.956 --> 01:20:31.158
OH, THANK YOU.

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:34.361
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:20:34.363 --> 01:20:36.563
HERE YOU GO. THANK YOU.

01:20:36.599 --> 01:20:37.498
THANK YOU.

01:20:37.633 --> 01:20:39.833
THANK YOU. BYE.

01:20:39.902 --> 01:20:41.902
I TIPPED THEM $4.00,
$2.00 EACH.

01:20:42.037 --> 01:20:43.837
IT'S GREAT.

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:46.039
IT'S NOT TOO MUCH?

01:20:46.075 --> 01:20:47.908
PERFECT.

01:20:48.043 --> 01:20:50.845
MAGGIE, WE CAN'T BE DIVORCED.

01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:51.912
HOW ARE WE GONNA
TELL THE KIDS?

01:20:52.047 --> 01:20:56.717
MAGGIE, WILL YOU MARRY ME?

01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:12.466
ANTONIO, WOULD YOU
MARRY US, PLEASE?

01:21:12.601 --> 01:21:14.868
I WOULD BE HONORED,
BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARY

01:21:14.904 --> 01:21:20.340
BECAUSE I DID NOT FILE
THE DIVORCE PAPERS.

01:21:20.376 --> 01:21:23.877
MY DEAR MR. AND MRS. WESTON,
YOU MUST UNDERSTAND.

01:21:23.946 --> 01:21:26.947
SO MANY COUPLES COME
TO MANZANILLA EACH YEAR,

01:21:27.016 --> 01:21:30.550
BUT WHEN I SAW YOU,
SOME VALENTINO SPOKE TO ME,

01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:33.286
AND HE SAID, "ANTONIO,
HERE ARE TWO PEOPLE

01:21:33.322 --> 01:21:36.657
WHO DESPERATELY WANT
TO FIX A LOVE THAT IS BROKEN."

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:38.758
WAS I WRONG TO LISTEN?

01:21:38.794 --> 01:21:40.995
NO.

01:21:42.765 --> 01:21:46.166
GEORGE, WE COULD RENEW OUR VOWS.

01:21:46.168 --> 01:21:48.101
BUT THERE'S NO TIME.
THEY'RE BOARDING.

01:21:48.137 --> 01:21:49.770
NO, NO, NO.

01:21:49.839 --> 01:21:53.173

TWO VERY DIFFERENT PROCEDURES.

TAKE GEORGE WESTON

IN SICKNESS AND HEALTH
