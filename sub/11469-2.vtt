[ Door closes ]

35:36.517 --> 35:38.952
My client wants to help you
clear up several homicides

35:39.087 --> 35:40.521
in which he was involved.

35:40.621 --> 35:42.855
And in exchange, he gets
to maximize his exposure,

35:42.955 --> 35:44.890
a life without parole,
no death penalty.

35:44.990 --> 35:47.393
Correct.
We have DNA from your Van,

35:47.493 --> 35:49.294
as many as seven
possible victims.

35:49.394 --> 35:52.097
Why would I make a deal
before we get the science back

35:52.130 --> 35:54.198
and see what unsolveds
we can match it to?

35:54.298 --> 35:55.932
And we have the body
from the Van.

35:56.100 --> 35:57.200
You need Mr. waits to tell you

35:57.300 --> 35:59.001
where the other bodies
are buried.

their loved ones
have been found

36:03.838 --> 36:05.972

incarcerated.

If I don't tell you,
you'll never know.

I think we're good
with what we've got.

36:12.011 --> 36:13.912
There's another case.

36:14.012 --> 36:16.248
You already have the body.

36:16.348 --> 36:17.516
Wait.
We never discussed this.

36:17.616 --> 36:21.519
I was saving it...
For this meeting.

36:23.520 --> 36:27.923
It's not the entire body,
just the bones.

36:28.023 --> 36:29.858
What case is that?

36:29.958 --> 36:33.594
Up in the canyon,
the 12-year-old kid.

36:33.694 --> 36:37.197
A dog found his bones.

36:37.297 --> 36:40.933

36:41.033 --> 36:43.835
I like the view so much,

36:43.935 --> 36:47.003
I put the others
up there, too.

36:47.138 --> 36:51.141
It's peaceful, serene.

36:57.646 --> 37:00.748
How many murders
are we talking about exactly?

37:00.848 --> 37:02.450
Oh.

So, what do we have on him

38:02.395 --> 38:04.530
besides a 25-year-old
molestation conviction?

38:04.630 --> 38:06.864
Well, we're working
on a search warrant,

38:06.964 --> 38:08.233
but it's pretty thin.

38:08.333 --> 38:10.033
Detectives found some stuff
in the house,

38:10.201 --> 38:11.268
some -- some photos of kids.

38:11.368 --> 38:13.603
Pornographic?
Not at all.

38:13.703 --> 38:15.671
They also found
some boys' stuff --

38:15.771 --> 38:16.806
baseball mitts and a bike.

38:16.906 --> 38:18.072
Was he cooperative?

38:18.207 --> 38:20.342
Offered to take
a polygraph.

38:20.442 --> 38:23.511
And where are we
on identifying the victim?

38:23.611 --> 38:25.612
We're cross-referencing
the leads from the tip line

38:25.712 --> 38:27.347
with hospital records
and missing persons.

38:28.915 --> 38:34.852
Chief, uh, can I speak to you
about captain pounds?

38:34.952 --> 38:37.655
Bosch thinks that captain pounds
gave money Chandler

38:37.755 --> 38:40.257
a copy of his confidential
board of rights file.

38:40.357 --> 38:42.691
That's a serious allegation,
lieutenant.

38:42.791 --> 38:44.293
Bosch believes it.

38:44.393 --> 38:45.694
And that makes it so?

38:45.794 --> 38:46.928
We need officers to trust

38:47.028 --> 38:48.530

hearings

are actually confidential

to make a statement

38:53.934 --> 38:55.468
and talk
to a department shrink.

To then have their personal
background thrown at them

38:58.003 --> 39:01.440
in open court
is bullshit...Sir.

under advisement, lieutenant.
