more serious than that.

09:15.789 --> 09:18.723
If the transformation becomes
complete, Kim will be gone.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.458
Gone? Gone like how?

09:20.460 --> 09:22.661
Gone like gone...
as in forever.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.496
Kim, you can embarrass yourself

09:24.498 --> 09:25.830
right out of existence.

09:25.832 --> 09:28.466
The good news is,
I've isolated the cause...

09:28.468 --> 09:30.502
the pollen of the Aurora
orchid flower.

09:30.504 --> 09:31.736
It's only found

09:31.738 --> 09:33.605
in the remote regions
of the Amazon jungle.

09:33.607 --> 09:36.141
Another dose of pollen
should negate the effect.

09:36.143 --> 09:37.809
Quest time. Come on, Rufus.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.811
Oh, yeah!

09:39.813 --> 09:41.546
Let's go.
No way.

09:41.548 --> 09:44.382
What if you barf on the plane
or get gum stuck on your shoe?

09:44.384 --> 09:47.319
You have to stay right here and
avoid embarrassment at any cost.

09:47.321 --> 09:48.453
Oh, come on.

09:48.455 --> 09:49.621
If I can do anything,

09:49.623 --> 09:52.157
I can keep myself
from getting embarrassed.

09:52.159 --> 09:53.325
Totally mind over matter.

09:53.327 --> 09:54.659
Sorry, too risky, KP.

09:54.661 --> 09:56.094
I mean, if it were me.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.529
You what?

09:57.531 --> 09:58.730
If I got hit by Drakken,
it wouldn't matter.

09:58.732 --> 10:01.266
How so? Oh, I don't
get embarrassed.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.534
Ever? Not that I can remember.

10:02.536 --> 10:04.469
But what about the time
you lost your pants?

10:04.471 --> 10:06.871
<i>Times.</i> Too many
to count, my friend.

10:06.873 --> 10:07.772
And did I blush?

10:07.774 --> 10:09.240
I did not.

10:09.242 --> 10:10.475
Hate to admit it,
but he's right.

10:10.477 --> 10:11.309
You're grounded.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.777
( <i>sighs</i>)

10:12.779 --> 10:14.512
( <i>groans</i> )

10:14.514 --> 10:16.681
KIM:
<i>Okay, blinds closed.</i>

10:16.683 --> 10:18.516
Doors locked. Computer off.

10:18.518 --> 10:19.684
No embarrassment.

10:19.686 --> 10:20.652
No embarrassment.

10:20.654 --> 10:21.653
Oh, wait.

10:21.655 --> 10:22.887
The phone.

10:24.190 --> 10:25.624
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

10:25.626 --> 10:26.625
Hello?

10:26.627 --> 10:28.493
Kim, it's Josh.

10:28.495 --> 10:31.630
Josh, look I'm-I'm
so sorry about your shirt.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.431
Kim, I just wanted
to see if you're okay?

10:33.433 --> 10:35.567
I'm fine... for the most part.

10:35.569 --> 10:38.370
Listen, I... know this
is kind of... last second,

10:38.372 --> 10:40.472
but... do you want to hang out
tonight? I don't know...

10:40.474 --> 10:41.840
Yes. I mean no.

10:41.842 --> 10:42.874
I mean yes.

10:42.876 --> 10:45.610
I want to, but, uh, yes.

10:45.612 --> 10:47.145
Yes, yes.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.714
I'm sorry, is that your way
of saying yes or no?

10:49.716 --> 10:51.483
The answer is definitely yes.

10:51.485 --> 10:54.519
Just give me a couple
of minutes to get changed, okay?

11:02.895 --> 11:04.496
Hold up once
you get to the dock.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.197
I'll be right there to meet you.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.432
To meet us? You? Really?

11:07.434 --> 11:09.701
I figured you could
use some backup.

11:09.703 --> 11:13.304
Besides, it's time I got some
experience in the field.

11:14.306 --> 11:15.507
Ron, Rufus.

11:15.509 --> 11:17.342
Wade, I must say
it's a pleasure

11:17.344 --> 11:19.511
to finally
meet you in the flesh.

11:20.646 --> 11:22.914
Meet the Wadebot XR prototype.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.617
Okay, not flesh per se.

11:26.819 --> 11:28.486
Let's roll.

11:28.488 --> 11:29.688
( <i>straining</i>)

11:29.690 --> 11:31.222
How are we doing on time?

11:31.224 --> 11:33.692
As long as Kim stays in her
room, we should be cool.

11:36.262 --> 11:39.297
( <i>doorbell chimes</i> )

11:39.299 --> 11:40.598
We'll get it!
We'll get it!

11:40.600 --> 11:42.233
Don't even think
about it, tweebs.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.702
Hi, Kim.
Hey, Josh.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.336
You ready?

11:45.338 --> 11:46.838
( <i>kissing noises</i>)

11:46.840 --> 11:47.839
Let's ride.

11:47.841 --> 11:48.973
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.

11:48.975 --> 11:50.809
I'll be home by 10:00.

11:52.812 --> 11:54.746
Just in case.

11:54.748 --> 11:56.748
Okay, so if she
gets home by 10:00,

11:56.750 --> 11:57.949
she'll be on her computer

11:57.951 --> 11:59.651
doing the diary
spill by about...

11:59.653 --> 12:00.852
10:01!

12:00.854 --> 12:03.021
So we hack into
the diary by 10:02.

12:03.023 --> 12:04.589
No good.
Why no good?

12:04.591 --> 12:08.393
She'll be up all night writing
gushy stuff about Josh.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.495
Oh, right. The earliest
we can get the dirt

12:10.497 --> 12:11.696
will be tomorrow morning.

12:11.698 --> 12:13.264
Unless...

12:13.266 --> 12:14.766
We spy.

12:14.768 --> 12:16.401
Hoo-sha!

12:17.269 --> 12:18.503
I hope you're hungry.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.271
Ravenous.

12:20.273 --> 12:23.508
Sorry. It's a little
chilly in here. Brrr!

Table for two, please.

12:27.848 --> 12:32.450
( <i>jaunty music playing</i>)

12:35.688 --> 12:37.856
We need to make it another six
or seven miles downriver.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.691
It should...

12:42.661 --> 12:43.661

12:43.663 --> 12:45.463
Rapids? They're not on the map.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.599
No. They're right
in front of us!

How do you like me now,
Mother Nature?

13:16.329 --> 13:17.495
Who's your daddy?

13:17.497 --> 13:18.797

That's not on the map either.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.475
( <i>all screaming</i> )

13:39.018 --> 13:43.688
It feels good to get out
of my room once in a while.

13:43.690 --> 13:45.757
I'm serious.
It's the mix of the hot

13:45.759 --> 13:47.625
and salty, and cold and sweet.

13:49.862 --> 13:52.497
Is Josh doing what
I think he's doing?

13:52.499 --> 13:54.732
Dipping his fry into his shake?

13:54.734 --> 13:56.835
What does Kim
see in this freak?

13:56.837 --> 13:59.437
Try it.

13:59.439 --> 14:02.440
A french fry
dipped in a milkshake.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.843
Josh Manke,

14:04.845 --> 14:07.946
Huh, he's kind of cute.
I approve.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.348
What are you,

We're trying
to vanish Kim Possible

14:12.018 --> 14:14.085
from the face of the Earth.
Remember?

14:14.087 --> 14:16.120
One heaping helping
of embarrassment?

No way. Not until
I know you way better.

is really getting good!

on Earth

where the Aurora orchid grows.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.165
See if you could set it
down there, Wade.

15:01.167 --> 15:03.568
That looks like a safe spot.

be gone for good.

to borrow those binoculars

19:25.331 --> 19:27.398
Yes. Why do you ask?

19:27.400 --> 19:30.801
Oh, uh... um... no reason.

19:33.305 --> 19:35.139
Hey, check it out.

19:38.377 --> 19:40.077
Josh, this is amazing.

19:40.079 --> 19:42.079
You did it, didn't you?

19:42.081 --> 19:45.149
Yeah. Yeah, oh, me and some
of the neighborhood kids.

19:45.151 --> 19:47.051
It was all tagged
with graffiti before.

19:47.053 --> 19:48.686
It's beautiful.

19:50.956 --> 19:52.690
Here you go, Kim.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.226
One rare, endangered
Amazonian orchid for... Kim?

19:55.228 --> 19:58.196
Blinds down. Computer off.
Phone...

19:58.198 --> 19:59.964
Caller I.D. Caller I.D.

20:01.900 --> 20:03.834
Manke.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.704
This was fun tonight.

20:11.143 --> 20:12.410
What's going on?

20:12.412 --> 20:13.811
No!

20:13.813 --> 20:15.112
Not that.

20:15.114 --> 20:17.148
Kim, is that you taking a bath?

20:25.891 --> 20:26.958
Kim?

20:26.960 --> 20:28.392
Talk to me, Wade.

20:28.394 --> 20:29.927
I'm picking up thermal scans

20:29.929 --> 20:31.929
from a floating head
in Middleton Park.

20:31.931 --> 20:33.231
That's probably her, right?

20:33.233 --> 20:34.498
Hang on, Kim!

20:36.768 --> 20:40.171
This is the weirdest date
I've ever been on.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.740
( <i>gasping</i> )

20:42.742 --> 20:43.874
Tweebs!

20:43.876 --> 20:45.876
Hey, Kim, how come
you're just a head?

20:45.878 --> 20:47.912
Yeah. Is that like
full-blown cooties or something?

20:47.914 --> 20:49.080
Home. Now.

20:49.082 --> 20:50.448
I'll destroy you two later.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.817
But if that was Jim and Tim,
then where are...?

20:53.986 --> 20:55.253
( <i>kiaiing</i> )

20:55.255 --> 20:57.388
Ahh! Ooh!

20:57.390 --> 20:59.824
What's up? Show's over?

21:02.261 --> 21:04.562
DRAKKEN:
Yes, she's just a head.

21:04.564 --> 21:06.197
Finish her!

21:06.199 --> 21:08.099
Give her the pimple punch!

21:08.101 --> 21:09.333
Pimple punch?

21:09.335 --> 21:11.002
Pimple punch?

21:12.271 --> 21:13.838
( <i>gasps</i> )

21:26.051 --> 21:27.151
( <i>coughing</i> )

21:27.153 --> 21:28.853
Oh, you got to be kidding.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.488
That is... Oh, my!

21:34.793 --> 21:35.893
Hey, there you are.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.128
What's going on?

21:37.130 --> 21:38.162
What's with the cape?

21:38.164 --> 21:39.497
Long story.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.532
No. It's cool.

21:43.068 --> 21:44.302
( <i>sneezing</i> )

21:44.304 --> 21:47.071
Josh, wa-wait.

21:47.073 --> 21:48.039
( <i>sneezes</i>)

21:48.041 --> 21:50.408
( <i>sneezing</i> )

21:51.276 --> 21:53.077
Bless you.

21:56.915 --> 21:59.850
Come on.
What is the big secret?

21:59.852 --> 22:02.219
Okay. You promise
you won't laugh?

22:02.221 --> 22:03.321
Yeah. Cross my heart.

22:03.323 --> 22:04.655
I like to put marshmallows

22:04.657 --> 22:05.823
on hot dogs, okay?

22:05.825 --> 22:06.891
Are you happy now?

22:06.893 --> 22:08.359
Marshmallows?
Are you for real?

22:08.361 --> 22:10.261
That's, like,
totally embarrassing.

22:10.263 --> 22:13.097
Yeah, but I can live with it.

22:16.268 --> 22:18.002
Do you know what
this night has been?

22:18.004 --> 22:19.937
Yes. Perfect.
