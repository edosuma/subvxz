♪♪

00:12.011 --> 00:13.138
One thousand!

00:14.807 --> 00:17.768
(Henry)

00:14.807 --> 00:17.768
Uhh... The number of times

00:14.807 --> 00:17.768
you forgot to wear underwear!

00:18.978 --> 00:21.229
No. That only happened,

00:18.978 --> 00:21.229
like, nine times.

00:22.648 --> 00:23.983
(sighs)

00:22.648 --> 00:23.983
Ten.

00:25.108 --> 00:27.736
Okay.

00:25.108 --> 00:27.736
So, 1,000 what?

00:27.778 --> 00:30.489
Sit-ups. I'm talkin'

00:27.778 --> 00:30.489
'bout sit-ups, boy.

00:31.406 --> 00:33.033
No way you can do

00:31.406 --> 00:33.033
1,000 sit-ups.

00:33.659 --> 00:34.869
Not in a row.

00:35.369 --> 00:39.581
But I've done four sit-ups

00:35.369 --> 00:39.581
every day for the past 250 days,

00:40.415 --> 00:41.583
which is 1,000!

00:42.918 --> 00:44.795
(Henry)

00:42.918 --> 00:44.795
Wow. Hardcore.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.715
Punch me.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.715
Punch me right in the gut.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.516
(groaning)

00:57.558 --> 00:58.684
(giggles)

00:58.726 --> 01:00.352
You okay?

01:00.394 --> 01:03.230
Yeah. I'm just going to rest

01:00.394 --> 01:03.230
down here for a minute.

01:04.231 --> 01:05.232
Okay.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.694
And this is for you.

01:08.903 --> 01:10.571
(Jasper continues groaning)

01:10.612 --> 01:11.572
What is this?

01:12.155 --> 01:13.240
It's your favorite.

01:13.281 --> 01:16.493
A grilled cheese...

01:13.281 --> 01:16.493
with skeezits.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.039
Why are you

01:18.370 --> 01:20.039
giving me this?

01:20.080 --> 01:22.041
Because I'm your sister,

01:20.080 --> 01:22.041
and I love you.

01:22.624 --> 01:25.293
(Jasper groans)

01:22.624 --> 01:25.293
Don't trust her.

01:30.674 --> 01:32.175
It won't explode.

01:32.968 --> 01:33.969
Just enjoy it.

01:37.096 --> 01:41.309
Oh, hey... can I borrow

01:37.096 --> 01:41.309
your Yo Pro camera?

01:41.351 --> 01:42.686
I knew it!

01:43.062 --> 01:43.687
What?

01:44.646 --> 01:46.105
You brought me this

01:44.646 --> 01:46.105
because you want something.

01:46.982 --> 01:48.025
Come on, man.

01:48.692 --> 01:49.317
No way.

01:50.027 --> 01:51.486
I spent over 100 bucks

01:50.027 --> 01:51.486
on that thing

01:51.528 --> 01:53.154
and I'm not

01:51.528 --> 01:53.154
lending it to anybody.

01:53.614 --> 01:54.448
Sorry.

01:54.698 --> 01:56.199
(continues groaning)

02:08.712 --> 02:09.713
I told you so.

02:10.839 --> 02:11.757
(knocking at door)

02:12.716 --> 02:13.884
Hey, Henry.

02:12.716 --> 02:13.884
You ready?

02:13.926 --> 02:15.260
Yeah, I just got

02:13.926 --> 02:15.260
to grab my jacket.

02:16.762 --> 02:19.306
Uhhh... I don't know

02:16.762 --> 02:19.306
if you noticed,

02:19.347 --> 02:20.849
but there's a Jasper

02:19.347 --> 02:20.849
on your floor.

02:23.602 --> 02:24.812
Eating dirty skeezits.

02:26.187 --> 02:26.939
(Henry)

02:26.187 --> 02:26.939
Yeah.

02:27.314 --> 02:28.607
Hey, Jasp,

02:28.649 --> 02:30.150
me and Char are going to

02:28.649 --> 02:30.150
head over to Junk-n-Stuff.

02:30.191 --> 02:31.652
(grunts)

02:30.191 --> 02:31.652
Have fun.

02:32.319 --> 02:33.361
You okay?

02:33.403 --> 02:34.655
You want some water

02:33.403 --> 02:34.655
or something?

02:34.696 --> 02:35.322
Yeah.

02:35.572 --> 02:36.490
Sink's in the kitchen.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.162
(grunting)

02:42.871 --> 02:45.540
I guess<i> you</i> don't have

02:42.871 --> 02:45.540
a Yo Pro camera I can borrow.

02:46.041 --> 02:49.086
Nah. My parents don't like me

02:46.041 --> 02:49.086
to have things.

02:49.795 --> 02:50.587
Great.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.675
Dude, if you need

02:51.839 --> 02:54.675
a Yo Pro, just go buy one.

02:55.050 --> 02:55.884
Uh...

02:56.551 --> 02:58.512
You see a money tree

02:56.551 --> 02:58.512
growing out of my butt?

03:00.179 --> 03:02.850
Well, then sell something

03:00.179 --> 03:02.850
to get some money.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.143
Sell what?

03:04.434 --> 03:05.226
I don't know.

03:05.644 --> 03:06.520
There's got to be

03:05.644 --> 03:06.520
something around here

03:06.561 --> 03:07.813
you don't want anymore.

03:08.229 --> 03:10.774
Like my old playhouse

03:08.229 --> 03:10.774
in the backyard?

03:11.358 --> 03:13.902
Oh, yeah.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.902
That's good.

03:14.235 --> 03:15.654
A playhouse is property.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.656
So?

03:17.698 --> 03:18.740
Tell you what.

03:18.782 --> 03:20.534
I'll fix up

03:18.782 --> 03:20.534
your old playhouse,

03:20.575 --> 03:21.910
make it look all nice and

03:22.243 --> 03:23.244
then I'll help you

03:22.243 --> 03:23.244
sell it.

03:23.620 --> 03:24.872
And what do you want?

03:25.956 --> 03:27.124
We split the money

03:25.956 --> 03:27.124
from the sale.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.208
You get half,

03:27.541 --> 03:29.208
I get half.

03:29.835 --> 03:31.753
A'ight.

03:29.835 --> 03:31.753
I'll do that.

03:32.754 --> 03:33.505
Deal.

03:41.346 --> 03:42.472
It all just

03:41.346 --> 03:42.472
kind of happened.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.725
My dad was

03:42.806 --> 03:44.725
an irresponsible scientist.

03:45.350 --> 03:46.935
I wanted

03:45.350 --> 03:46.935
an afterschool job.

03:47.268 --> 03:49.813
(Captain Man)

03:47.268 --> 03:49.813
And by accident,

03:47.268 --> 03:49.813
he made me indestructible.

03:49.855 --> 03:50.898
Ahhh!

03:51.148 --> 03:52.816
(Henry)

03:51.148 --> 03:52.816
I went to

03:51.148 --> 03:52.816
this crazy store

03:53.441 --> 03:55.276
and met a pretty

03:53.441 --> 03:55.276
interesting guy.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.486
I'm going to

03:55.318 --> 03:56.486
blow your mind.

03:56.987 --> 03:59.239
(Captain Man)

03:56.987 --> 03:59.239
Now I protect the good

03:56.987 --> 03:59.239
citizens of Swellview.

03:59.489 --> 04:00.365
Who call me...

04:00.407 --> 04:01.366
(Henry)

04:00.407 --> 04:01.366
He turned out to be...

04:01.700 --> 04:02.450
You know the name.

04:02.492 --> 04:03.493
Captain man!

04:03.535 --> 04:04.745
That's right, Henry.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.497
In time, I realized

04:04.912 --> 04:07.497
that being a superhero

04:07.539 --> 04:08.916
is a lot to handle alone.

04:09.249 --> 04:09.958
He wanted some help.

04:10.333 --> 04:11.543
(Captain Man)

04:10.333 --> 04:11.543
I needed a sidekick.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.087
I, Henry hart...

04:13.128 --> 04:14.588
(Captain Man)

04:13.128 --> 04:14.588
Pledge to never ever

04:13.128 --> 04:14.588
ever tell anyone...

04:14.629 --> 04:16.506
That I'm captain man's

04:14.629 --> 04:16.506
secret sidekick.

04:16.548 --> 04:17.382
It is done.

04:17.507 --> 04:18.633
(Henry)

04:17.507 --> 04:18.633
Now we blow bubbles.

04:18.675 --> 04:19.467
(Captain Man)

04:18.675 --> 04:19.467
And fight crime.

04:19.718 --> 04:20.844
(Henry)

04:19.718 --> 04:20.844
Feels good.

04:21.261 --> 04:28.018
♪♪

04:35.316 --> 04:36.317
Call it.

04:36.359 --> 04:37.945
Up the tubeee!

04:38.445 --> 04:39.571
Oh, my boot.

04:39.947 --> 04:40.864
(Captain Man)

04:39.947 --> 04:40.864
Ha!

04:52.626 --> 04:54.211
Hey.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.211
Hey, Char?

04:54.878 --> 04:56.046
Yeah, what's up?

04:56.088 --> 04:57.005
Have you, uh...

04:58.048 --> 04:59.841
have you been noticing

04:58.048 --> 04:59.841
anything, like,

05:00.425 --> 05:02.010
weird about Ray?

05:02.343 --> 05:06.765
Uhhh... Every day.

05:02.343 --> 05:06.765
All the time. Why?

05:08.016 --> 05:08.976
No, I mean...

05:10.518 --> 05:11.561
He's been talking...

05:12.353 --> 05:14.940
Like, when nobody else

05:12.353 --> 05:14.940
is around.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.235
You mean...

05:15.983 --> 05:18.235
Talking to himself?

05:18.277 --> 05:19.778
Yeah.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.530
Like, full-on conversations

05:19.820 --> 05:22.530
with people who aren't there.

05:23.115 --> 05:26.701
Well, my uncle Rosco talks to

05:23.115 --> 05:26.701
his food before he eats it.

05:26.743 --> 05:27.744
What's he say?

05:28.120 --> 05:30.622
Stuff like...

05:28.120 --> 05:30.622
"Well, hello, hamburger.

05:31.456 --> 05:34.293
You're about to take a trip

05:31.456 --> 05:34.293
down to belly town."

05:35.543 --> 05:36.753
(Ray)

05:35.543 --> 05:36.753
Is that

05:35.543 --> 05:36.753
a serious question?

05:37.254 --> 05:39.047
No, I can't go ride

05:37.254 --> 05:39.047
roller coasters with you

05:39.089 --> 05:40.339
because I have a job.

05:40.674 --> 05:41.466
And stop poking me.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.052
Hey guys.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.762
You find out any more info

05:44.094 --> 05:45.762
on that motorcycle thief?

05:45.804 --> 05:47.430
Will you not stand

05:45.804 --> 05:47.430
so close to me?

05:48.223 --> 05:49.683
I can feel you

05:48.223 --> 05:49.683
breathing on my neck.

05:51.268 --> 05:51.977
Thank you.

05:57.191 --> 05:58.817
Why are you guys

05:57.191 --> 05:58.817
staring at me?

05:59.567 --> 06:00.485
Uh...

06:00.610 --> 06:01.444
Because you're

06:00.610 --> 06:01.444
talking to nobody.

06:01.486 --> 06:02.112
Shh!

06:02.154 --> 06:02.988
It's got to be said.

06:05.406 --> 06:07.617
Right, I haven't

06:05.406 --> 06:07.617
introduced you to Brad.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.494
Brad, this is Henry

06:08.160 --> 06:09.494
and Charlotte.

06:09.536 --> 06:12.371
Guys...

06:09.536 --> 06:12.371
this is invisible Brad.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.252
Hiii, Braaad.

06:18.253 --> 06:19.796
Looking good, Brad.

06:21.923 --> 06:22.924
Brad, say hi.

06:25.093 --> 06:25.802
Brad?

06:27.346 --> 06:29.056
Ugh.

06:27.346 --> 06:29.056
Come on, Brad.

06:29.764 --> 06:30.765
Hate it

06:29.764 --> 06:30.765
when he does this.

06:32.517 --> 06:33.643
Brad?

06:33.685 --> 06:35.187
Brad?

06:33.685 --> 06:35.187
Where are you?

06:35.854 --> 06:37.272
Come on, this isn't

06:35.854 --> 06:37.272
funny anymore, man.

06:37.981 --> 06:38.773
Brad!

06:38.815 --> 06:39.900
This is so sad.

06:39.941 --> 06:40.734
He's not okay.

06:41.776 --> 06:42.819
Ah! Gotcha.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.946
(grunting)

06:47.448 --> 06:48.116
Come here.

06:49.284 --> 06:51.452
Now, say hello

06:49.284 --> 06:51.452
to those kids.

06:54.331 --> 06:55.249
Hey, guys.

06:56.583 --> 06:57.251
I'm Brad.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.421
There's no such thing

07:00.254 --> 07:02.421
as an invisible person.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.633
Okay, what would make you

07:02.964 --> 07:05.633
believe that Brad's real?

07:06.218 --> 07:07.761
Let's see him

07:06.218 --> 07:07.761
slap Henry.

07:07.802 --> 07:08.803
(scoffs)

07:07.802 --> 07:08.803
Yeah.

07:09.263 --> 07:11.431
Come on,

07:09.263 --> 07:11.431
slap me, Brad.

07:11.932 --> 07:12.974
Right here on my--

07:11.932 --> 07:12.974
(slaps)

07:22.442 --> 07:25.362
(both)

07:22.442 --> 07:25.362
Heeey, Braaad.

07:31.952 --> 07:35.914
Looks like about

07:31.952 --> 07:35.914
14 square feet,

07:37.040 --> 07:39.167
imported Mexican plastic.

07:40.794 --> 07:41.920
This is a nice house.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.505
It's old

07:42.462 --> 07:44.505
and disgusting.

07:45.299 --> 07:47.550
No, we just hose it down,

07:47.592 --> 07:49.928
fix the cracks,

07:47.592 --> 07:49.928
shine it up all nice,

07:49.970 --> 07:52.055
and I bet you we get

07:49.970 --> 07:52.055
a couple hundred bucks for it.

07:52.847 --> 07:54.015
Seriously?

07:54.474 --> 07:55.100
Yeah.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.185
There's a big demand

07:55.809 --> 07:57.185
for playhouses like this.

07:57.518 --> 07:58.770
Now, let me check

07:57.518 --> 07:58.770
out the inside.

07:59.229 --> 08:01.481
Or as we say,

07:59.229 --> 08:01.481
the interior.

08:08.405 --> 08:11.366
Oh, yeah!

08:08.405 --> 08:11.366
This is nice.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.076
And it's even got it's--

08:13.493 --> 08:17.331
(screaming)

08:21.626 --> 08:22.961
What's in there?

08:26.631 --> 08:29.050
That beast was living

08:26.631 --> 08:29.050
in your playhouse!

08:30.510 --> 08:33.054
Hey!

08:30.510 --> 08:33.054
You owe me rent!

08:35.849 --> 08:37.309
Ugh, ugh!

08:41.271 --> 08:42.397
Hey, pass the ketchup?

08:42.897 --> 08:44.691
(Brad)

08:42.897 --> 08:44.691
Sure. Here you go.

08:47.110 --> 08:48.403
So, Brad,

08:47.110 --> 08:48.403
I have a question.

08:48.903 --> 08:50.989
Did something make you

08:48.903 --> 08:50.989
become invisible

08:51.031 --> 08:52.324
or were you just

08:51.031 --> 08:52.324
born this way?

08:52.740 --> 08:55.035
(Brad)

08:52.740 --> 08:55.035
Nah, nobody's

08:52.740 --> 08:55.035
born invisible.

08:55.618 --> 08:57.287
Wait, I thought you were

08:55.618 --> 08:57.287
sitting right there.

08:57.329 --> 08:58.955
(Brad)

08:57.329 --> 08:58.955
I was. But...

08:58.997 --> 09:01.875
My leg was cramping up

08:58.997 --> 09:01.875
so I'm walking around.

09:02.501 --> 09:04.336
How do we talk to a guy

09:02.501 --> 09:04.336
we can't see?

09:04.669 --> 09:06.505
Here, Brad.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.505
Put these on and sit down.

09:06.921 --> 09:07.630
(Brad)

09:06.921 --> 09:07.630
Yeah, okay.

09:11.134 --> 09:13.553
So, you turned invisible,

09:11.134 --> 09:13.553
like, when?

09:14.137 --> 09:14.929
Five years ago.

09:15.263 --> 09:17.432
It was all

09:15.263 --> 09:17.432
Captain Man's fault.

09:17.474 --> 09:18.892
(sighs)

09:17.474 --> 09:18.892
Here we go again.

09:19.351 --> 09:20.519
Well, what happened?

09:21.228 --> 09:23.813
Okay, see, I was being chased

09:21.228 --> 09:23.813
by this insane criminal

09:23.855 --> 09:25.440
who wanted to turn me

09:23.855 --> 09:25.440
invisible.

09:25.482 --> 09:26.274
Why?

09:26.607 --> 09:27.942
I don't know,

09:26.607 --> 09:27.942
because he hated me and

09:28.068 --> 09:30.320
I guess he knew how much

09:28.068 --> 09:30.320
I enjoy being visible?

09:31.530 --> 09:33.907
(Brad)

09:31.530 --> 09:33.907
Yeah, like I used to be.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.201
It wasn't my fault.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.327
Yes, it was!

09:38.661 --> 09:39.704
Just tell us what happened.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.873
Okay, so this evil dude

09:40.080 --> 09:41.873
was firing at me

09:41.915 --> 09:43.208
with his invisiblaster, right?

09:43.542 --> 09:46.920
I was just riding my bike,

09:43.542 --> 09:46.920
minding my own business.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.130
When I dove out

09:47.921 --> 09:49.130
of the way,

09:49.172 --> 09:50.965
the invisiblaster's beam

09:49.172 --> 09:50.965
missed me and--

09:51.007 --> 09:51.883
Hit me!

09:52.551 --> 09:54.844
And that's how Captain Man

09:52.551 --> 09:54.844
ruined my life.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.431
How was I supposed

09:56.096 --> 09:57.431
to know

09:57.472 --> 09:58.681
you'd be riding your bike

09:57.472 --> 09:58.681
right behind me?

09:59.182 --> 10:00.434
You owe me.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.438
Look, didn't I lend you

10:02.310 --> 10:04.438
4,000 bucks

10:04.479 --> 10:06.106
so you could buy

10:04.479 --> 10:06.106
that hot tub?

10:06.231 --> 10:08.233
Didn't I let you stay here

10:06.231 --> 10:08.233
in the man cave for two months

10:08.275 --> 10:09.568
after your girlfriend

10:08.275 --> 10:09.568
dumped you?

10:10.068 --> 10:11.652
And who paid

10:10.068 --> 10:11.652
for that nose job, huh?

10:11.694 --> 10:12.446
This guy.

10:13.738 --> 10:14.531
(Brad)

10:13.738 --> 10:14.531
Great.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.408
Now I have

10:14.948 --> 10:16.408
a beautiful nose

10:16.699 --> 10:18.535
that no one

10:16.699 --> 10:18.535
will ever see.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.788
Their relationship

10:20.120 --> 10:21.788
is really complicated.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.499
What do you want

10:23.039 --> 10:24.499
from me, Brad?

10:27.877 --> 10:29.546
(Brad)

10:27.877 --> 10:29.546
I want to be

10:27.877 --> 10:29.546
your sidekick.

10:30.171 --> 10:30.838
What?

10:31.172 --> 10:32.882
Hey, hey,

10:31.172 --> 10:32.882
whoa, whoa, hey!

10:33.716 --> 10:35.676
Ray's already

10:33.716 --> 10:35.676
got a sidekick, me.

10:36.010 --> 10:38.679
(Brad)

10:36.010 --> 10:38.679
You're just a kid,

10:36.010 --> 10:38.679
who's visible.

10:39.222 --> 10:41.266
Oh! So you're

10:39.222 --> 10:41.266
better than me

10:41.308 --> 10:42.725
just 'cause I'm visible

10:41.308 --> 10:42.725
and you're not?

10:42.767 --> 10:44.227
All right, guys,

10:42.767 --> 10:44.227
come on.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.229
Let's not play

10:44.644 --> 10:46.229
the visibility card.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.899
Brad... I think

10:47.772 --> 10:49.899
it's time for you to go.

10:51.651 --> 10:52.360
(Brad)

10:51.651 --> 10:52.360
Wait.

10:53.236 --> 10:55.071
Think about

10:53.236 --> 10:55.071
what a great sidekick I'd be.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.408
I could sneak up

10:56.030 --> 10:58.408
on bad guys, and then...

10:56.030 --> 10:58.408
(punches)

10:59.159 --> 11:00.201
Ow!

11:01.202 --> 11:01.869
I'm okay.

11:03.037 --> 11:05.457
(Brad)

11:03.037 --> 11:05.457
See? You never saw

11:03.037 --> 11:05.457
that punch coming.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.667
Look, I already have

11:05.790 --> 11:07.667
an excellent sidekick

11:07.708 --> 11:08.543
and that's Henry.

11:08.585 --> 11:09.461
Thank you.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.046
(Brad)

11:10.086 --> 11:12.046
All right.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.046
What if Henry quits?

11:12.088 --> 11:13.006
I'm never going to quit.

11:13.047 --> 11:13.798
He's not quitting.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.842
(Brad)

11:14.382 --> 11:15.842
But what if he does?

11:14.382 --> 11:15.842
Then what?

11:17.302 --> 11:18.345
All right, Brad.

11:18.719 --> 11:20.972
If Henry ever quits,

11:18.719 --> 11:20.972
you can be my sidekick, okay?

11:21.014 --> 11:22.098
Anything else?

11:22.140 --> 11:23.766
(Brad)

11:22.140 --> 11:23.766
Yeah. I want your shirt.

11:24.601 --> 11:25.602
You can't have

11:24.601 --> 11:25.602
my shirt.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.021
Hey! Brad!

11:29.189 --> 11:30.273
Give me my shirt back, Brad.

11:30.649 --> 11:31.566
Brad!

11:32.233 --> 11:33.360
Kids, don't,

11:32.233 --> 11:33.360
don't look at this.

11:35.529 --> 11:37.364
Okay,

11:35.529 --> 11:37.364
seriously, though,

11:37.405 --> 11:39.157
it's not funny anymore,

11:37.405 --> 11:39.157
so, okay.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.286
Ah! I'm not playing

11:41.784 --> 11:43.286
with you, man.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.621
Brad. Brad!

11:45.746 --> 11:47.165
You don't

11:45.746 --> 11:47.165
wear clothes anyway.

12:04.349 --> 12:05.350
(Brad grunts)

12:06.893 --> 12:07.810
(Henry)

12:06.893 --> 12:07.810
Oh, what the...

12:08.311 --> 12:08.978
What's goin on?

12:09.312 --> 12:09.979
(Brad)

12:09.312 --> 12:09.979
Quit your job.

12:10.021 --> 12:11.856
(footsteps)

12:13.024 --> 12:14.067
(bushes rustling)

12:14.108 --> 12:14.733
(thumps)

12:22.200 --> 12:23.076
Uh...

12:24.536 --> 12:26.204
Did you feel

12:24.536 --> 12:26.204
that earthquake, too?

12:41.760 --> 12:42.554
Henry!

12:42.803 --> 12:43.430
Whoa, what, what?

12:44.598 --> 12:45.348
Why you sleeping?

12:45.932 --> 12:48.017
Because...

12:45.932 --> 12:48.017
I was up all night,

12:48.059 --> 12:50.228
and this invisible guy

12:48.059 --> 12:50.228
kept sneaking into my room,

12:50.270 --> 12:51.438
and flipping

12:50.270 --> 12:51.438
my bed over, and...

12:53.189 --> 12:56.192
That's the dream

12:53.189 --> 12:56.192
I kept having.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.280
Well, will you pass out

12:58.027 --> 13:00.280
some of these flyers for me?

13:00.779 --> 13:01.489
What are these?

13:02.198 --> 13:03.742
They're for a house

13:02.198 --> 13:03.742
I'm selling with Piper.

13:04.158 --> 13:05.326
I'm her real estate agent.

13:05.577 --> 13:06.953
(bell rings)

13:06.994 --> 13:09.038
Isn't this her old,

13:06.994 --> 13:09.038
gross playhouse

13:09.080 --> 13:10.373
that's been sitting

13:09.080 --> 13:10.373
in my backyard

13:10.415 --> 13:11.332
for the last five years?

13:11.625 --> 13:13.752
Yeah,

13:11.625 --> 13:13.752
but I totally remodeled it.

13:14.043 --> 13:15.587
I'm telling you,

13:14.043 --> 13:15.587
for the right buyer, this--

13:15.629 --> 13:16.588
Henry. Henry, I...

13:17.004 --> 13:17.796
Hi, Miss Shapen.

13:18.797 --> 13:19.758
I need to

13:18.797 --> 13:19.758
talk to Henry.

13:20.383 --> 13:21.800
Okay.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.725
One... Two...

13:28.767 --> 13:30.769
(screaming)

13:32.395 --> 13:33.980
Henry,

13:32.395 --> 13:33.980
I need some advice.

13:34.397 --> 13:35.231
What about?

13:35.940 --> 13:37.651
Well, I joined this

13:35.940 --> 13:37.651
new online dating service,

13:38.025 --> 13:39.778
dontletmediealone.com.

13:41.112 --> 13:42.280
Right, right, right.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.823
None of the men

13:43.156 --> 13:44.823
are contacting me.

13:45.866 --> 13:46.660
Oh...

13:47.368 --> 13:50.913
Well, that's very common

13:47.368 --> 13:50.913
for people of...

13:51.956 --> 13:53.792
Yourself.

13:55.460 --> 13:56.961
It's just that,

13:55.460 --> 13:56.961
you know, I thought you--

13:57.211 --> 13:58.212
(screams)

13:59.589 --> 14:00.423
(Brad laughs)

14:00.465 --> 14:01.299
Ugh!

14:01.341 --> 14:02.676
What the bucket?

14:03.926 --> 14:06.929
(screaming)

14:07.846 --> 14:08.973
(Brad)

14:07.846 --> 14:08.973
Quit your job!

14:09.390 --> 14:10.433
(footsteps running away)

14:22.821 --> 14:23.904
(distant chatter)

14:24.364 --> 14:25.448
Ooh, here they come.

14:26.157 --> 14:28.785
Now, act professional

14:26.157 --> 14:28.785
and be nice.

14:28.827 --> 14:30.036
Don't tell me

14:28.827 --> 14:30.036
what to do.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.497
Do you want to

14:30.995 --> 14:32.497
sell this house

14:32.539 --> 14:34.332
and get the money

14:32.539 --> 14:34.332
to buy a Yo Pro camera?

14:34.374 --> 14:36.751
Yeah, but you work for me.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.751
I don't work for you.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.878
-Do you want

14:36.793 --> 14:38.878
my help or not?

14:36.793 --> 14:38.878
-This is my playhouse.

14:38.919 --> 14:40.463
-This is no time to argue.

14:38.919 --> 14:40.463
-I'm in charge here.

14:40.505 --> 14:41.506
Who do you think you are?

14:41.548 --> 14:42.882
Well, hello.

14:42.923 --> 14:44.718
Welcome to my backyard.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.928
Mommy,

14:46.052 --> 14:47.928
I love this playhouse.

14:48.179 --> 14:50.473
Hey, looks like your daughter's

14:48.179 --> 14:50.473
already in love.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.351
Yes, what kind of

14:51.140 --> 14:53.351
playhouse is this?

14:53.393 --> 14:56.312
It's the Playmaster

14:53.393 --> 14:56.312
Plus Dream House.

14:56.688 --> 14:58.231
Yes. It was built

14:56.688 --> 14:58.231
in '09

14:58.773 --> 15:00.358
out of imported Mexican plastic.

15:01.442 --> 15:05.154
Mommy, I love it so much.

15:01.442 --> 15:05.154
Can I have it, please?

15:05.905 --> 15:08.115
Uh, would you consider $50?

15:08.491 --> 15:09.784
$50?!

15:11.285 --> 15:12.412
Let me handle this.

15:12.829 --> 15:13.580
(groans)

15:14.914 --> 15:16.374
My client feels that $50

15:16.416 --> 15:18.959
is way too low for a playhouse

15:16.416 --> 15:18.959
of this quality.

15:19.460 --> 15:22.171
Come on.

15:19.460 --> 15:22.171
It's not exactly fresh and new.

15:22.547 --> 15:23.840
Neither are you.

15:24.965 --> 15:26.676
Okay, you need to learn

15:24.965 --> 15:26.676
some manners.

15:26.718 --> 15:27.594
That's it.

15:27.927 --> 15:28.887
Piper, don't.

15:28.928 --> 15:29.888
We'll take 50.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.305
I am not buying

15:29.929 --> 15:31.305
a playhouse

15:31.347 --> 15:33.516
from a rude little girl

15:31.347 --> 15:33.516
who tells me that--

15:33.558 --> 15:38.438
(screaming)

15:39.647 --> 15:41.232
Wait! No! Come back!

15:47.614 --> 15:48.907
You were

15:47.614 --> 15:48.907
a little aggressive.

15:53.411 --> 15:55.830
So, I'm sound asleep

15:53.411 --> 15:55.830
in my bed

15:55.872 --> 15:57.998
and Brad sneaks in

15:55.872 --> 15:57.998
to my house

15:58.040 --> 15:59.542
and flips my bed over.

16:00.543 --> 16:02.002
This game is impossible.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.838
I can't get all these ants

16:02.044 --> 16:03.838
in this little pair of pants.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.549
I feel like you're not

16:05.131 --> 16:06.549
listening to me.

16:08.175 --> 16:11.262
Look, I know Brad's

16:08.175 --> 16:11.262
kind of obnoxious.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.054
Kind of?

16:12.472 --> 16:13.848
He snuck into my school,

16:13.890 --> 16:15.349
put a bucket

16:13.890 --> 16:15.349
on my teacher's head,

16:15.391 --> 16:17.560
splashed water

16:15.391 --> 16:17.560
on my area,

16:18.519 --> 16:20.897
and then he spanked

16:18.519 --> 16:20.897
my teacher with a mop.

16:22.273 --> 16:23.190
Yeah, that's Brad.

16:24.275 --> 16:25.944
And every time,

16:24.275 --> 16:25.944
before he runs away,

16:25.985 --> 16:28.195
he goes, "quit your job."

16:28.863 --> 16:30.865
Hey! Another ant...

16:31.658 --> 16:32.659
in the pants.

16:35.620 --> 16:36.663
Hey, what is that?

16:37.371 --> 16:39.415
I don't know.

16:37.371 --> 16:39.415
Looks like a steel pipe.

16:39.958 --> 16:40.917
But why would it--

16:41.334 --> 16:42.084
Brad!

16:43.210 --> 16:43.962
What are you--

16:44.378 --> 16:45.505
(Henry screams)

16:45.546 --> 16:46.255
Brad!

16:46.923 --> 16:47.966
(Brad)

16:46.923 --> 16:47.966
Quit your job.

16:48.967 --> 16:50.134
This has to stop, Brad!

16:50.426 --> 16:52.762
(crying dramatically)

16:50.426 --> 16:52.762
Ohh, why? Why? Why?!

16:57.809 --> 16:59.059
This better work.

17:00.227 --> 17:00.895
What is that?

17:01.395 --> 17:02.229
Turkey leg.

17:03.690 --> 17:04.482
How's my eye look?

17:06.860 --> 17:08.068
Put the leg back on it.

17:09.278 --> 17:10.196
(doorbell rings)

17:10.237 --> 17:10.822
Finally.

17:10.864 --> 17:13.616
(grunting)

17:18.204 --> 17:19.205
Your parents here?

17:19.246 --> 17:20.206
(Henry)

17:19.246 --> 17:20.206
No, just come in.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.416
So, what happened now?

17:23.250 --> 17:23.960
This.

17:25.085 --> 17:25.920
Ahhh!

17:26.796 --> 17:28.047
Who gave you

17:26.796 --> 17:28.047
the black eye?

17:28.088 --> 17:28.923
Invisible Brad.

17:28.965 --> 17:29.757
He punched you?

17:30.216 --> 17:31.926
Worse.

17:30.216 --> 17:31.926
I was in gym class today,

17:31.968 --> 17:33.803
and I was standing

17:31.968 --> 17:33.803
behind Mitch Bilsky.

17:33.845 --> 17:35.221
So what'd

17:33.845 --> 17:35.221
invisible Brad do?

17:35.262 --> 17:37.849
He pinched Mitch Bilsky

17:35.262 --> 17:37.849
on the butt!

17:38.975 --> 17:40.643
to make Mitch think

17:38.975 --> 17:40.643
I did it.

17:40.685 --> 17:43.354
- Ooh, yeah,

17:40.685 --> 17:43.354
guys don't like that.

17:40.685 --> 17:43.354
- No, they don't.

17:43.396 --> 17:46.190
Uh, girls don't like that

17:43.396 --> 17:46.190
either, just so you know.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.735
We got to do something

17:47.066 --> 17:48.735
about Brad.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.152
Don't worry.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.152
We're going to get him.

17:50.570 --> 17:51.487
(Brad)

17:50.570 --> 17:51.487
I doubt it.

17:51.529 --> 17:52.363
(screaming)

17:53.656 --> 17:54.782
(Brad)

17:53.656 --> 17:54.782
Quit your job.

17:57.326 --> 17:58.244
(Henry grunts)

17:59.119 --> 18:00.747
(Brad)

17:59.119 --> 18:00.747
You have

17:59.119 --> 18:00.747
a beautiful home.

18:08.295 --> 18:10.214
How do we beat a guy

18:08.295 --> 18:10.214
we can't see?

18:10.757 --> 18:13.342
Uh, we fix it

18:10.757 --> 18:13.342
so we can see him.

18:13.384 --> 18:14.260
How?

18:14.301 --> 18:15.053
Yeah, how?

18:15.344 --> 18:16.220
With paint.

18:16.429 --> 18:17.972
Oh, come on,

18:16.429 --> 18:17.972
how is paint gonna...

18:18.014 --> 18:19.724
I don't really think that paint

18:18.014 --> 18:19.724
is the answer that we're...

18:20.558 --> 18:21.893
(both)

18:20.558 --> 18:21.893
Paint!

18:25.772 --> 18:27.899
And this is the Playmaster

18:25.772 --> 18:27.899
Plus Dream House?

18:28.274 --> 18:31.778
Yes, sir.

18:28.274 --> 18:31.778
Imported Mexican plastic.

18:32.987 --> 18:34.405
Well, Eric,

18:32.987 --> 18:34.405
what do you think?

18:35.197 --> 18:36.282
I love it.

18:36.407 --> 18:37.283
-Yeah?

18:37.533 --> 18:38.659
It is a very nice playhouse.

18:38.993 --> 18:40.745
It's not just

18:38.993 --> 18:40.745
a play house,

18:41.996 --> 18:42.663
it's a play home.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.125
Dad, please buy it.

18:46.542 --> 18:49.796
You know, rabbits used to do

18:46.542 --> 18:49.796
their business in that thing.

18:51.213 --> 18:52.339
Piper!

18:52.882 --> 18:54.216
I promise you,

18:54.258 --> 18:56.343
I totally power-hosed

18:54.258 --> 18:56.343
every square inch--

18:56.385 --> 18:57.303
(laughs) It's okay.

18:57.678 --> 18:58.763
How much do you want for it?

18:59.430 --> 19:00.389
200?

19:01.181 --> 19:02.016
Deal.

19:02.058 --> 19:03.101
Oh, wow.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.645
Sorry, this playhouse

19:03.601 --> 19:05.645
isn't for sale.

19:05.686 --> 19:07.438
Yeah...

19:05.686 --> 19:07.438
Wait, what?

19:08.522 --> 19:11.317
Kid, your friend already

19:08.522 --> 19:11.317
accepted my offer for 200--

19:11.358 --> 19:13.444
It's my playhouse

19:11.358 --> 19:13.444
and I'm not selling it.

19:13.987 --> 19:15.488
You can't just change your mind

19:13.987 --> 19:15.488
in the middle of--

19:15.529 --> 19:18.491
(screaming)

19:19.784 --> 19:21.577
Wait, wait, wait!

19:19.784 --> 19:21.577
Come back!

19:27.625 --> 19:30.252
He was going to

19:27.625 --> 19:30.252
give us 200 bucks.

19:30.795 --> 19:33.798
100 for each of us.

19:30.795 --> 19:33.798
And you sprayed him away!

19:35.215 --> 19:35.925
I'm sorry.

19:36.968 --> 19:37.718
It's just...

19:39.012 --> 19:41.722
My mom and dad gave this to me

19:39.012 --> 19:41.722
for my fourth birthday.

19:42.932 --> 19:43.766
And I guess...

19:44.934 --> 19:46.769
I guess I'm just not ready

19:44.934 --> 19:46.769
to let it go yet.

19:48.562 --> 19:50.773
Okay.

19:48.562 --> 19:50.773
I understand.

19:51.649 --> 19:52.775
I just wish you'd told me

19:52.817 --> 19:54.443
before I spent my money

19:52.817 --> 19:54.443
to fix it all up.

19:55.319 --> 19:56.154
I'm really sorry.

19:56.487 --> 19:57.363
It's...

19:56.487 --> 19:57.363
Hey.

19:58.156 --> 19:59.866
Would it be okay

19:58.156 --> 19:59.866
if I just played with it...

20:01.826 --> 20:03.243
By myself

20:01.826 --> 20:03.243
for a little while?

20:04.078 --> 20:04.829
Sure.

20:06.164 --> 20:06.789
Have fun, kiddo.

20:16.674 --> 20:18.509
Okay, you said 300.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.054
Yep. Here you go.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.764
Get it off my lawn

20:21.762 --> 20:23.764
by six o'clock.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.561
(Henry)

20:26.934 --> 20:28.561
Okay, is the trip wire set?

20:28.602 --> 20:29.269
Just about.

20:29.896 --> 20:32.148
Oh, this is going

20:29.896 --> 20:32.148
to be so great.

20:32.523 --> 20:34.775
Invisible Brad's going to get

20:32.523 --> 20:34.775
covered with red paint,

20:35.068 --> 20:36.986
so we'll be able

20:35.068 --> 20:36.986
to see him, and then

20:37.028 --> 20:38.571
we're going to kick him

20:37.028 --> 20:38.571
about 50 times

20:38.612 --> 20:39.655
right in his invisible--

20:39.697 --> 20:40.865
okay, I get it.

20:42.366 --> 20:43.910
(beeping)

20:47.538 --> 20:48.539
Ray?

20:50.166 --> 20:51.667
Why did you

20:50.166 --> 20:51.667
come down the tube?

20:52.251 --> 20:54.170
You were supposed to walk out

20:52.251 --> 20:54.170
of the elevator with Brad.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.547
I...

20:54.754 --> 20:56.547
I need to sit down.

20:57.339 --> 20:58.799
Are you okay?

20:59.175 --> 20:59.926
What's wrong?

21:01.260 --> 21:02.845
Is Brad in here

21:01.260 --> 21:02.845
with us now?

21:05.389 --> 21:06.557
I wish he was.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.435
Well, what happened?

21:10.019 --> 21:11.478
Everything was going

21:10.019 --> 21:11.478
according to plan.

21:12.312 --> 21:14.857
I told invisible Brad

21:12.312 --> 21:14.857
that Henry quit

21:14.899 --> 21:16.650
and that he could be

21:14.899 --> 21:16.650
my new sidekick.

21:16.692 --> 21:17.443
And did he buy it?

21:17.735 --> 21:19.653
Ohhh...

21:17.735 --> 21:19.653
he bought it.

21:20.487 --> 21:21.781
What does that mean?

21:22.990 --> 21:23.908
Well...

21:24.283 --> 21:26.119
We were finishing

21:24.283 --> 21:26.119
our root beers,

21:26.744 --> 21:27.912
we took a selfie,

21:28.662 --> 21:30.081
I paid the check,

21:30.123 --> 21:32.166
and then we were walking

21:30.123 --> 21:32.166
across the street together

21:32.208 --> 21:32.875
on our way here.

21:33.459 --> 21:34.127
And?

21:35.502 --> 21:36.879
Brad got hit by a bus.

21:39.090 --> 21:41.675
I guess the driver

21:39.090 --> 21:41.675
just didn't see him.

Mmm
