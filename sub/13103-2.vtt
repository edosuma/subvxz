WEBVTT

00:03.128 --> 00:04.959
Sorry it wasn't wrapped.
It was overnight.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.916
Take your time.
I'm early anyway.

00:06.965 --> 00:09.456
They did a really nice job.
Looks brand-new.

00:09.510 --> 00:10.750
Yeah, it is. It is.

00:10.802 --> 00:13.885
It's just, um, I kind of had a rough first day,
so a fresh start, you know?

00:13.931 --> 00:15.296
(woman) Help! Stop him!

00:15.349 --> 00:17.806
Police! Stop that man!

00:17.851 --> 00:18.840
|sntthatyou?

00:18.894 --> 00:20.850
Uh... Uh...

00:21.313 --> 00:23.679
(Jeremy Fisher) J‘ She runs guns,
everyone wants guns J‘

00:23.732 --> 00:25.518
J‘ She runs guns, everyone wants guns J‘

00:25.567 --> 00:26.682
Police!

00:26.735 --> 00:28.441
J‘ She runs guns, everyone wants guns J‘

00:29.029 --> 00:30.644
J‘ She runs guns, everyone wants... J‘

00:30.697 --> 00:32.312
Thanks so much for getting us.

00:35.244 --> 00:36.279
Come on.

00:37.829 --> 00:40.286
You know, you're lucky Officer Shaw
was willing to give you a ride.

00:40.541 --> 00:41.997
I would have made you walk.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.623
- Let's go.
- McNally?

00:43.669 --> 00:46.581
- Yeah?
- You left your dry cleaning in my car.

00:47.256 --> 00:48.336
Oh, thank you.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.168
.l‘ Doo-doo-doo-doo .l‘

00:51.218 --> 00:52.253
Come on.

00:52.302 --> 00:53.508
Aah!

00:53.554 --> 00:55.465
Oh, thank you.

00:55.514 --> 00:57.596
.l‘ Left her for the L.R.A. .l‘

00:57.641 --> 01:00.007
.l‘ Fly by a million hornets .l‘

01:00.060 --> 01:01.721
.l‘ These bullets know my name .l‘

01:02.062 --> 01:03.051
Ooh!

01:03.105 --> 01:04.845
.l‘ She runs guns, everyone wants guns .l‘

01:04.898 --> 01:06.729
Could you just... It's fine.

01:06.775 --> 01:07.935
.l‘ There she goes... .l‘

01:07.985 --> 01:09.145
Gosh. (chuckles)

01:09.194 --> 01:10.695
She's a rookie.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.022
Pfft. It shows.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.108
Hey. She caught you, didn't she?

01:14.783 --> 01:15.943
(door buzzes, beeps)

01:15.993 --> 01:18.700
.l‘ Why do you wanna save me? .l‘

01:18.745 --> 01:20.531
.l‘ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh .l‘

01:20.581 --> 01:21.570
I can book him.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.830
.l‘ Lord, my soul is taken .l‘

01:23.875 --> 01:25.536
.l‘ Doo, doo, doo-doo-doo-doo .l‘

01:25.586 --> 01:28.077
J‘ Doo, doo,
doo-doo-doo-doo .l‘

01:28.130 --> 01:29.165
.l‘ Doo, doo... .l‘

01:29.214 --> 01:31.205
Oh. Hello.

01:31.258 --> 01:33.374
Oh. You're in uniform?

01:33.427 --> 01:36.385
Yeah, well, can't really work undercover

01:36.430 --> 01:38.341
now that everybody on the street
knows I'm a cop,

01:38.390 --> 01:39.880
so thanks for that.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.888
She, uh, chase you down an alley
and jump on you, too?

01:43.937 --> 01:46.178
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, she does that.

01:46.231 --> 01:48.438
You sure he's not an undercover cop?

01:49.276 --> 01:50.391
(Shaw exhales, laughs)

01:50.444 --> 01:51.559
(door buzzes, beeps)

01:51.612 --> 01:54.399
.l‘ Her love is a scar that never heals .l‘

01:54.448 --> 01:56.359
.l‘ Ooh, ooh, whee, ooh .l‘

01:56.408 --> 01:58.069
(sirens wailing)

01:58.118 --> 01:59.449
.l‘ There she goes .l‘

01:59.494 --> 02:01.655
"Mercury goes retrograde today.

02:01.705 --> 02:04.412
"Expect communication breakdown,
crossed paths.

02:04.458 --> 02:07.040
Nothing will go as planned."
Are you listening?

02:07.085 --> 02:08.700
Listen, I'm just trying to get
through my second shift

02:08.754 --> 02:11.370
without messing up
in a catastrophic way again, all right?

02:11.423 --> 02:13.379
We haven't even paraded yet.
You already caught a bad guy.

02:13.425 --> 02:14.915
We're just ridin' you.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.424
You weren't wearing your uniform.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.585
It's actually true.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.796
If you're not on shift,
you don't go after a subject.

02:20.849 --> 02:23.340
"Heavy badge syndrome."
That's what it's called.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.930
Oh, thanks, Chris. Thanks.

02:25.979 --> 02:26.968
- Well, no, I'm--
- No, really.

02:27.022 --> 02:30.389
No, I'm just saying, follow the rules,
listen to your T.O., you're golden.

02:30.442 --> 02:32.899
See, now that's a horoscope
I can actually get behind.

02:32.944 --> 02:34.525
Oh, let me guess--Capricorn?

02:34.571 --> 02:36.983
Power-mad,
goat of the zodiac?

02:37.282 --> 02:41.150
Hell, no. I'm a Leo. Hit me up.
Lion of Zion in the house.

02:41.203 --> 02:42.784
(gun fires)
Oh! Whoa!

02:44.748 --> 02:46.784
Oh, man. You're gonna have
so much paperwork.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.245
Some of you may remember
a guy named Don Reaney Jr.

02:50.295 --> 02:51.455
from a triple murder
he committed last November.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.167
Reaney? No way! Snakeface.
(laughs)

02:54.216 --> 02:56.207
Yeah, go ahead and laugh,
but it took us months to nail him.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.170
He's not as dumb
as the tattoo makes him look.

02:58.220 --> 03:01.633
(all) Whoa! Whoo-hoo!

03:01.682 --> 03:02.842
(Noelle) Look who's back in harness.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.597
(Sam, singsong) Da-da-da-dah.

03:04.643 --> 03:06.099
Thank you, thank you. Feels good.

03:06.144 --> 03:09.477
Drank a bottle of amarone,
shaved, took a hot shower...

03:09.523 --> 03:10.512
with your mother...

03:10.565 --> 03:12.430
(all) Oh!

03:12.484 --> 03:14.645
(Boyko) All right, settle down.
Pay attention.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.277
Reaney here escaped from
a prison transport this morning,

03:17.322 --> 03:18.858
put one guard in a coma.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.193
- Where'd we lose him?
- Yonge and Gerrard, his old stomping grounds.

03:21.368 --> 03:25.657
Our very own 15 division.
We need to get this guy today.

03:25.706 --> 03:28.664
Rookies, this is a real chance
to make your bones.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.371
Epstein, you're with Shaw.

03:31.753 --> 03:32.833
Epstein, nice.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.625
Peck, Williams.

03:37.884 --> 03:41.001
McNally, your training officer today

03:41.054 --> 03:42.043
will be Sam Swarek.

03:42.097 --> 03:44.383
- (man chuckles)
- (woman) Wow.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.342
Now it's, uh, Sammy's
first shift back in uniform,

03:48.395 --> 03:51.057
so, McNally, be gentle with him...
this time.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.100
Serve, protect,

03:53.150 --> 03:55.015
and watch your partner's back.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.649
Go on. Get out there.

03:56.737 --> 04:00.070
(indistinct conversations)

04:01.450 --> 04:03.441
(Sam) It's an absolute falsehood.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.700
- What is up with that?
- No, no, no. He was--

04:05.746 --> 04:09.034
Half-caf with, uh, skim,
two sweeteners. (panting)

04:09.082 --> 04:10.492
Are you kissing my ass?

04:10.959 --> 04:12.915
It's... just coffee.

04:13.837 --> 04:15.327
'Cause, you know,
I ain't going easy on you

04:15.380 --> 04:19.089
just 'cause your parents are white shirts.
Are we clear?

04:19.676 --> 04:21.382
Yeah, l'm-- I'm a rookie, ma'am.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.760
I'm just here to listen and learn, that's all.

04:27.058 --> 04:28.923
- Ooh!
- Gentlemen.

04:29.352 --> 04:30.558
Ladies.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.552
- Cheers.
- Yeah.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.517
(indistinct police radio chatter)

04:35.650 --> 04:36.901
Feeling punished?

04:36.943 --> 04:39.525
What? Uh, no. No, sir.

04:39.571 --> 04:40.651
Good.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.563
Tell that hairball if he pushes you around,
he has to answer to me.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.700
(snorts) Right, like I'm
gonna be calling Homicide.

04:46.745 --> 04:48.531
Hey, I could use the company.

04:50.749 --> 04:53.240
Anyway, I mean it.
You need anything, call me.

04:57.214 --> 04:58.795
(Luke on phone)
Sorry about that. Callaghan.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.753
(female dispatcher speaks indistinctly)

05:02.803 --> 05:04.088
(engines starts, siren wailing in distance)

05:04.137 --> 05:06.093
Okay, so I'm sure you've had the talk.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.255
Partners--you back me up
no matter what.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.548
Don't move unless I tell you to.

05:09.601 --> 05:12.638
- It's my car, so my rules are the rules.
- Yes, sir.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.894
Good, so here's my addendum.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.680
I'm here because I'd rather work the streets

05:16.733 --> 05:19.816
than man the wire room
until a spot in Guns-and-Gangs opens up.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.397
And while I do like working the streets,

05:21.446 --> 05:24.654
I did not ask to train a rookie.
I did not ask to have a partner.

05:24.699 --> 05:26.906
I'm not your boyfriend.
I will not be holding your hand.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.949
Well, that's great,
'cause I don't date cops anyway.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.496
Sweetheart, you're not my type.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.454
Um, I was thinking that maybe
we should look for this guy

05:33.500 --> 05:34.660
around Gerrard and Jarvis.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.701
You know, if I just got out ofjail,
I'd want some drugs and a hooker--stat.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.920
- That's good. Or we can follow my lead.
- That's great.

05:40.966 --> 05:42.297
- Sound good?
- Yes, sir.

05:45.095 --> 05:46.676
(Grand Analog)
.l‘ Yo, no need to freak out .l‘

05:46.721 --> 05:47.972
.l‘ Unless you're freaked out .l‘

05:48.014 --> 05:50.596
.l‘ I bring the passion back in one freestyle .l‘

05:50.642 --> 05:53.509
J‘ This ain't no accident,
just a brainchild of another... .l‘

05:53.562 --> 05:56.474
(Dov) Dude, we are gonna crack
some Snakeface skull. I can feel it.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.229
Action followed by more action.

05:58.567 --> 06:01.104
Now shouldn't we be, uh, out on the prowl?

06:01.945 --> 06:03.151
Hungry like the wolf?

06:05.073 --> 06:08.986
We are looking for a weedy guy.

06:09.035 --> 06:12.118
He shows up here the same time,
just like clockwork, huh?

06:12.163 --> 06:13.198
Striped hoodie.

06:13.248 --> 06:14.488
Vertical or horizontal?

06:14.541 --> 06:16.657
(woman on radio)
There's an open container.

06:17.919 --> 06:19.295
You want to keep screwing around?

06:20.547 --> 06:22.128
Or do you want to do something?

06:22.173 --> 06:23.253
Do something, sir.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.086
Huh? Okay. Okay.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.796
You notice anything? No?

06:27.846 --> 06:29.211
Anything at all?

06:29.890 --> 06:32.677
(woman on radio) ...and would like an officer
to walk through the house with him.

06:33.351 --> 06:35.091
- He's right there.
- That's right.

06:35.145 --> 06:38.854
Known associate of Don Reaney Jr.,
okay? A con...

06:38.899 --> 06:42.608
(snaps fingers)
A con always checks in with his dealer.

06:42.652 --> 06:43.983
All right, get out of the car.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.399
- What?
- Bring him over here.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.693
And don't even think
about touching that gun.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.324
He's probably not armed.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.206
(door closes)

06:58.251 --> 06:59.866
(horn honks)

07:00.587 --> 07:01.827
Go get him.

07:04.341 --> 07:05.581
Go, Epstein.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.710
(dog barking)

07:09.763 --> 07:11.344
(speaking indistinctly)

07:14.935 --> 07:17.517
Excuse me, sir.
Can I ask you a couple--

07:21.942 --> 07:23.603
Police! Don't move!

07:24.194 --> 07:25.479
| just want to talk!

07:31.660 --> 07:34.367
(tires screech)
- Whoa!

07:34.412 --> 07:36.277
(gasping for breath)

07:36.331 --> 07:39.573
I said--
I said bring him over.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.617
- I tried. He ran.
- Get up.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.126
Oh, yeah?
You shouldn't have let him.

07:43.171 --> 07:46.004
Now we gotta book him, Epstein.
When you do it right, they don't run.

07:46.049 --> 07:48.711
(handcuffs click)
Hey, that was your second rookie mistake.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.671
- What was the first?
- Not buying my sandwich.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.427
Come on. No helmet, huh? Stupid.

07:54.015 --> 07:55.846
All right, let's go.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.098
Get in.

07:57.143 --> 07:58.679
- Okay.
- Man up.

07:59.604 --> 08:00.980
(horn honks)

08:03.233 --> 08:07.101
There's a red metal door down that alley
on your right, red gang tag.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.268
lt's open.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.698
Go up three flights.
Go into a small office on your left

08:10.740 --> 08:12.901
and arrest a woman named Emily Starling.

08:12.951 --> 08:14.942
- By myself?
- You're 5-0, aren't ya?

08:14.995 --> 08:16.781
- Uh, what?
- A cop.

08:17.789 --> 08:19.780
Oh, o-okay.
What's the charge?

08:19.833 --> 08:22.074
Family court warrant--
failure to pay child support.

08:22.127 --> 08:24.459
Child support?
Shouldn't we be looking for Reaney?

08:24.504 --> 08:25.710
She knows him, all right? Trust me.

08:25.755 --> 08:26.870
What's the matter?
You got a little stage fright?

08:26.923 --> 08:29.255
No, sir. It's just...

08:29.676 --> 08:30.665
Where's the warrant?

08:33.221 --> 08:34.336
Already signed.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.394
(Sam) Go on.

08:46.109 --> 08:48.100
(alarm wailing in distance)

08:49.821 --> 08:51.903
(horn blares in distance)

09:02.751 --> 09:03.957
Oh, crap.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.325
Come on.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.710
Hey, uh...

09:12.052 --> 09:14.338
(speed-dial beeps)

09:14.387 --> 09:16.093
(cell phone rings)

09:16.723 --> 09:17.963
(siren wailing in distance)

09:18.016 --> 09:19.096
(ring)

09:19.142 --> 09:20.131
(beep)

09:20.185 --> 09:21.220
What's up, copper?

09:21.269 --> 09:23.726
Hey, Dad, great.
Um... I got a question for you.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.520
When do l have the authority to enter?

09:25.565 --> 09:29.683
The reasonable expectation of a crime,
uh, life in danger.

09:30.779 --> 09:33.441
Are you actually asking me for help?

09:33.490 --> 09:35.776
I know. It's a switch.
So what about a warrant?

09:35.825 --> 09:39.158
Don't you have a training officer
to tell you about those things?

09:39.204 --> 09:42.617
Yeah, it's just--it's--it's complicated, okay?
lt's Swarek.

09:42.665 --> 09:45.953
Sam Swarek? (chuckles)
I'd just go ahead and kick the door in.

09:46.294 --> 09:49.411
He loves that kind of thing.
Go ahead. I got your back.

09:49.464 --> 09:50.670
Okay.

09:56.221 --> 09:58.257
Oh, my...

09:58.306 --> 10:00.467
Ooh! Okay.

10:00.517 --> 10:02.974
(inhales sharply)
Ow. It's really solid.

10:03.019 --> 10:06.056
Pick the lock then.
You want me to talk you through it?

10:06.106 --> 10:08.518
Dad, you taught me how to pick a lock
on my 12th birthday. I'm good.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.898
Oh. Well, good for me, then.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.606
- Thanks, Dad. I'll call you later.
- Go get 'em.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.122
(whispering) Okay.

10:28.002 --> 10:29.412
Come on.
(lock clicks)

10:30.171 --> 10:32.503
Yes! (chuckles)

10:34.134 --> 10:35.590
(door creaks)

10:35.635 --> 10:37.842
(indistinct police radio chatter,
telephone ringing)

10:37.887 --> 10:39.263
Why is my chair so high?

10:39.472 --> 10:43.761
You know, I bet someone threw out
the instructions to these things.

10:44.519 --> 10:45.554
Denise always does that.

10:45.603 --> 10:48.015
She comes home with a make-your-own
bookshelf or something, then she'll lose--

10:48.064 --> 10:49.804
You still got that girlfriend?

10:49.941 --> 10:51.021
Yeah. Yeah.

10:55.697 --> 10:56.857
Detective Barber.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.068
All right. Reaney's hit the media.

10:59.117 --> 11:01.779
There's gonna be tons of tips coming in,
most of them are crap.

11:01.828 --> 11:04.194
But I want you to keep me posted, okay?

11:04.247 --> 11:07.080
Uh, sir, how do we know when they're crap?

11:07.125 --> 11:10.333
Good question.
Officer Nash, you got a minute?

11:43.620 --> 11:44.700
Police.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.788
Emily Starling?
l have a warrant for your arrest.

11:50.210 --> 11:55.000
What? But I'm contesting that in court.
That was a legal U-turn.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.755
Actually, it's family court.
Um, failure to pay child support.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.586
Lady, I don't even have a kid.

11:59.636 --> 12:03.094
Ma'am, would you just stand up, okay?
Do you understand the charges against you?

12:03.139 --> 12:04.345
(Emily) Your charges are crap.

12:05.266 --> 12:07.552
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I have a warrant for this woman's arrest.

12:07.602 --> 12:08.762
They don't speak English.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.938
(speaking Chinese dialect)

12:10.980 --> 12:13.096
Look, I actually have a warrant, okay?

12:16.444 --> 12:17.775
lt's...

12:17.820 --> 12:20.857
Okay, um, it's right here.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.781
So can you just stand up? Come on.

12:24.327 --> 12:26.192
- Put your hands behind your back.
- You gotta be kidding me.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.328
This is not happening.

12:28.831 --> 12:30.787
Hurry up!
Let's get this over with.

12:30.833 --> 12:31.822
(handcuffs click)

12:34.462 --> 12:35.622
Move.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.750
(indistinct police radio chatter)

12:45.974 --> 12:47.760
Oh, no. No way.
Where the hell have you been?

12:47.809 --> 12:49.424
- I've been trying to reach you!
- Emily, calm down.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.843
- Why are you in a uniform, Sammy?
- My cover got blown.

12:51.896 --> 12:54.308
- Pedro was with me. He knows I'm a cop.
- That means everyone knows you're a cop.

12:54.357 --> 12:56.348
We don't have a lot of time here, okay?

12:56.401 --> 12:58.813
- Please take these off!
- Sweetheart, I'm so sorry.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.897
We gotta get you disappeared.
Get her in the back, okay?

13:00.947 --> 13:02.687
- No, no!
- Whoa, what the hell?

13:02.740 --> 13:04.571
It's okay. She's got a point. In the back.

13:05.451 --> 13:06.440
Come on.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.323
Hey, what's with the fake warrant?

13:13.376 --> 13:14.616
It's only fake if they look.

13:14.711 --> 13:17.168
Listen, I am trying to play by the rules, okay?
I'm trying to play by your rules.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.829
That's the thing.
|--| don't actually have any rules.

13:19.882 --> 13:20.917
But, uh, hey...

13:21.718 --> 13:22.798
Thanks for playing.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.765
(sirens wailing in the distance)

13:30.810 --> 13:33.301
(rock music soundtrack)

13:37.025 --> 13:38.981
I missed you last night.

13:39.027 --> 13:42.485
l have a life, Jerry, you know.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.904
I know the deal--

13:44.949 --> 13:46.780
no strings, we hook up...

13:46.826 --> 13:48.282
friends with benefits.

13:48.328 --> 13:52.947
(laughs) You are so cute
when you try and talk all young.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.455
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

13:55.293 --> 13:56.282
That's why I love you.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.452
You're not one of those girls
with crazy rules--

13:58.504 --> 14:02.793
you know, make the guy buy you dinner,
time your phone calls with a stopwatch.

14:02.842 --> 14:03.922
Give me those.

14:05.053 --> 14:06.668
Mmm.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.135
Oh, my God.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.265
What?

14:14.270 --> 14:16.056
Oh, no, that's Boyko with his puzzle.

14:16.731 --> 14:18.346
It's a one-way mirror, see?

14:18.858 --> 14:21.645
- It's cool.
- Jerry. (laughs)

14:24.072 --> 14:25.061
Jerry!

14:25.114 --> 14:27.275
What? I'm not your training officer.
Shh, shh, shh.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.362
(lowers voice)
You leave first. Go.

14:30.787 --> 14:31.776
All right.

14:44.801 --> 14:45.961
Got you a little something.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.591
It's no big deal.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.098
It's bad luck to give someone a knife.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.054
Not if that somebody's a copper.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.106
It's a Hosko. Check the blade.

15:01.984 --> 15:02.973
(Traci laughs)

15:03.027 --> 15:05.814
You know, now that you're on thejob,
in case things go south.

15:07.657 --> 15:09.363
Is that why I'm in the barn today--

15:09.867 --> 15:11.152
'cause you're worried about me?

15:11.202 --> 15:12.237
No.

15:12.829 --> 15:17.414
Okay, maybe I, uh,
put a little buzz in Boyko's ear.

15:17.458 --> 15:18.573
And buzzed what?

15:19.460 --> 15:20.449
Nothing.

15:20.503 --> 15:22.869
You know, just that you could
learn something from the D's.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.913
All right, this is not the academy.

15:24.966 --> 15:29.630
You are not my instructor anymore, okay?
Please, don't sabotage me.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.796
That inscription is lame.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.009
It's a saying.

15:41.858 --> 15:43.223
I need to go back to my apartment.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.107
No way. First place
Anton's people are gonna look.

15:45.153 --> 15:46.438
Anton Hill?

15:47.447 --> 15:49.529
You have to let me go home.

15:49.574 --> 15:50.609
Why? Something there you want?

15:50.658 --> 15:54.446
Yeah, my life, my clothes,
my books, my collection--

15:54.495 --> 15:56.360
Sir, we are not even
following orders.

15:56.414 --> 16:00.123
Girl's spent $900 on salt and pepper shakers.
Buys 'em online. It's insane.

16:00.168 --> 16:01.578
Shut up. They're valuable.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.367
Yeah? You can steal some new ones
at the bus station.

16:03.421 --> 16:05.628
Bus station?
I thought we had a deal.

16:05.673 --> 16:08.460
You promised me 5 grand,
said you'd help me move out west.

16:08.509 --> 16:09.715
You promised me somethin', too.

16:09.760 --> 16:10.920
And l have it.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.585
Yeah? Where?

16:12.972 --> 16:14.712
No way. It's my insurance.

16:14.765 --> 16:18.383
You're telling me l have to leave town,
my life's in danger.

16:18.436 --> 16:20.597
I don't have a dime, Sammy.
This is messed up.

16:20.646 --> 16:22.637
Okay, okay. We'll figure somethin' out.
(speed-dial beeps)

16:22.690 --> 16:25.147
- So now can I go home and get my stuff?
- No.

16:25.193 --> 16:26.524
- Please.
- No.

16:26.569 --> 16:28.901
- What are we doing?
- We're taking care of an informant,

16:28.946 --> 16:30.356
dropping her off with one of my guys.

16:31.449 --> 16:34.566
Reuben! Hey, bro. Swarek.
You ready to work off some debt here?

16:36.245 --> 16:38.531
I'm not sure he was, like, the guy.

16:38.581 --> 16:40.287
But he had this creepy tattoo.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.823
- Oh.
- I'll show you.

16:41.876 --> 16:43.741
Can I touch your arm,
or is that against the rules?

16:43.794 --> 16:45.785
Oh, it--it's legal.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.172
- (Chris) Huh...
It's right... here.

16:50.510 --> 16:51.875
Ma'am?

16:51.928 --> 16:53.589
(slurring)
That guy with the tattoo--

16:53.638 --> 16:55.799
l have some information.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.930
Okay. Let mejust grab a pen.

16:57.975 --> 16:59.931
(Chris) ...peace and quiet.

16:59.977 --> 17:02.559
My roommate's cool.
He can be a little--

17:02.605 --> 17:03.811
(man vomits)

17:05.191 --> 17:06.226
Ahh...

17:06.275 --> 17:09.517
Okay, whoa, whoa. Okay.
Yep, I got it. Okay.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.526
Maybe not. You know what?

17:13.407 --> 17:14.658
You're going to the drunk tank, sir.

17:14.700 --> 17:18.284
Chris--Officer Diaz,
the gentleman said he had a tip.

17:18.329 --> 17:19.694
He puked on our pamphlets.

17:20.665 --> 17:23.031
Those are the rules.
Come on. Okay, no.

17:23.167 --> 17:24.873
All right, come on.

17:25.836 --> 17:27.542
- Sammy.
- Reuben, Emily.

17:27.755 --> 17:29.336
- Hey.
- Babysit her. Keep her safe.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.792
- I will.
- I'll be right back.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.377
- You still going to meetings?
- You know it.

17:32.426 --> 17:34.678
Good. It works if you work it.
Behave.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.506
- Who, me or her?
- Both.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.713
(chuckles) Come on.
Let's get you some food.

17:44.438 --> 17:45.689
Boom! I've been shot.
Where are we?

17:46.607 --> 17:48.563
Front and Cherry, northeast corner.

17:49.819 --> 17:50.899
You're right.

17:50.945 --> 17:52.936
Probably been playing that
since you were 6.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.780
Yeah, I'm familiar with it.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.943
You know, I always admired
your mom making superintendent.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.366
It's not easy for a woman
to rise in the ranks like that.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.369
Total workaholic, huh?

18:06.669 --> 18:08.250
Yeah, right.

18:08.796 --> 18:12.505
My mom taught me
that success is 90% luck,

18:12.550 --> 18:13.665
10% timing.

18:13.718 --> 18:16.710
(woman on radio) All units, prepare to copy
information about the escapee.

18:16.762 --> 18:19.014
lnfo received from officers

18:19.056 --> 18:21.513
is that he purchased
crystal methamphetamine this morning.

18:22.518 --> 18:23.974
- Meth.
- (woman on radio) Use caution.

18:24.020 --> 18:27.433
He's probably tweaking. All right?
He's paranoid and super strong.

18:27.481 --> 18:28.982
Okay, so what do we do?

18:30.026 --> 18:31.391
We get the collar before anyone else.

18:33.613 --> 18:34.978
Luck and timing, right?

18:36.324 --> 18:38.360
(singsong voice)
Luck and timing.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.567
(door unlocks, creaks)

18:41.037 --> 18:42.447
Come on in.

18:42.496 --> 18:44.578
So this is where you live, huh?

18:44.624 --> 18:47.115
(clears throat)
Undercover, yeah--lived.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.583
Hey, took me months
to put this place together.

18:50.171 --> 18:51.377
Must have been tough.

18:51.756 --> 18:53.963
(rip)
Yeah, well, you adjust.

18:54.675 --> 18:56.461
You stop caring about the things
you care about.

18:58.179 --> 18:59.840
Well, you cared enough
about that plant--

18:59.889 --> 19:01.129
enough to water it.

19:01.474 --> 19:04.216
Yeah, well, you can'tjust get wasted
every night and buy stuff off of TV.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.553
You lose yourself that way.

19:05.603 --> 19:10.222
"Moby Dick"--on tape? Really?

19:10.274 --> 19:13.437
(chuckles)
What, is Anton Hill your white whale?

19:13.486 --> 19:15.727
No, it's just the longest book I could find.

19:16.238 --> 19:17.614
(cell phone rings)

19:19.241 --> 19:20.230
(ring)

19:20.284 --> 19:22.070
(beep)
Reuben, what's up?

19:23.079 --> 19:24.068
What? What?

19:24.121 --> 19:25.497
Stop. What?

19:27.750 --> 19:30.082
Emily's gone. She went home
to get her insurance.

19:30.711 --> 19:31.700
Get the door, will ya?

19:35.508 --> 19:38.124
So what, you always keep
your life savings in a mattress?

19:38.177 --> 19:40.463
Buy money for the dealers.
l was working undercover.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.094
Won't be missed.

19:42.139 --> 19:44.630
Listen, Emily is Anton's accountant, okay?

19:44.684 --> 19:46.970
Crazy math brain,
gift for laundering money.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.305
Anton pulled her off the street,
sent her to night school.

19:49.355 --> 19:50.390
What do you mean,
pulled her off the street?

19:50.439 --> 19:52.304
She was hooking for him,
started when she was 12.

19:53.067 --> 19:55.433
You know what she wants now?
To get her C.P.A.

19:55.903 --> 19:57.734
Are you gonna back me up
if I give her that money?

20:01.200 --> 20:02.189
Yeah.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.697
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay?

20:12.002 --> 20:14.038
(clears throat) Emily?

20:21.220 --> 20:22.300
lt's us.

20:22.346 --> 20:23.927
(doorknob jiggles)

20:24.557 --> 20:26.548
Emily?

20:29.311 --> 20:31.893
Stand back.

20:38.696 --> 20:39.731
Check it out?

20:48.664 --> 20:49.744
Emily?

20:57.590 --> 20:58.955
(Andy) Place is trashed.

21:01.218 --> 21:02.253
What happened here?

21:03.262 --> 21:04.251
Nothing good.

21:06.891 --> 21:08.722
No, sir. The tattoo's on his forehead.

21:08.768 --> 21:09.757
Yeah.

21:09.810 --> 21:12.142
Your son-in-law is probably
not the guy we're looking...

21:16.442 --> 21:19.354
Disregard.
Any of your tips panning out?

21:19.403 --> 21:21.268
Yeah, I smell a commendation.

21:24.158 --> 21:25.318
(Chris) Hey, what's wrong with you?

21:26.619 --> 21:28.985
(Traci on phone) This is Officer Nash
with Metro Police, 15 division.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.070
Do you think I'm scary?

21:32.124 --> 21:33.159
What do you mean?

21:33.209 --> 21:35.951
I mean, do I look intimidating?
Do | project authority?

21:36.003 --> 21:39.587
Is this because you discharged your gun,
and you're embarrassed?

21:39.632 --> 21:42.999
No, it's not. Oliver doesn't think
I can handle myself. Why?

21:43.052 --> 21:44.132
You're kind of small.

21:44.178 --> 21:45.258
Are you kidding me?

21:45.304 --> 21:47.295
- I'm just saying, for an officer--
- Stand up.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.014
Okay.

21:50.059 --> 21:53.267
I graduated from the same academy you did.
You don't think I can handle my own?

21:54.647 --> 21:56.888
Put your hands up. Come on.

21:58.192 --> 21:59.523
Brachial stun.

22:00.110 --> 22:02.362
Hit that bundle of nerves behind the ear,
you go down.

22:02.404 --> 22:05.817
Double ear clap.
Pressure makes you drop like a rock.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.816
All right. I believe you.
It's cool, man.

22:08.869 --> 22:10.245
- Sit down.
- Okay.

22:11.622 --> 22:12.611
(scoffs)

22:15.543 --> 22:16.783
(whispers)
That was so weird.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.326
Hey, Gail.

22:20.756 --> 22:21.745
Snob.

22:22.174 --> 22:25.291
- Peck's okay.
- No, you're hot and oblivious.

22:25.344 --> 22:29.553
And speaking of which, does Denise know
that you're a magnet for badge bunnies?

22:29.598 --> 22:30.587
I'm not a magnet.

22:30.641 --> 22:33.599
Okay, you're in a long-distance relationship
with your small-town girlfriend.

22:34.562 --> 22:35.893
Don't you get tempted to, like, stray?

22:35.938 --> 22:38.179
- (clears throat) I'm Catholic.
- So what? Me, too.

22:38.232 --> 22:40.188
No, I mean I'm a real Catholic.
| don'tjust sleep with anybody.

22:41.485 --> 22:42.645
Did you just call me a slut?

22:46.490 --> 22:48.071
No.
No, no, no, no.

22:48.117 --> 22:49.778
No, I meant that,
you know, you're fun.

22:49.827 --> 22:51.567
You know, you're fun.
You're--you're easy.

22:51.620 --> 22:54.362
No, no, no, no.
Not that kind of easy. Not--

22:54.415 --> 22:55.495
(Traci) Whatever.

22:59.044 --> 23:01.000
You think Anton trashed Emily's place?

23:01.046 --> 23:03.002
Yeah, they were looking for somethin'.

23:03.048 --> 23:05.004
Took Emily instead.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.756
So now what?

23:06.802 --> 23:08.758
We find out where she is.

23:08.804 --> 23:10.044
So back to the alley?

23:10.097 --> 23:11.712
We're going in the front this time.

23:13.809 --> 23:15.674
(doorbell chimes)
(Sam) Dewey Ling,

23:15.728 --> 23:18.811
king of the 2—ounce 8-ball.
Where's Emily?

23:18.856 --> 23:21.563
(sniffs)
You guys smell anything?

23:21.609 --> 23:23.145
I thought you guys couldn't speak English.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.189
(groans)

23:31.243 --> 23:32.949
Aah! Aah!

23:32.995 --> 23:35.236
- Sir, do you need some help?
- No, I'm good.

23:35.289 --> 23:38.907
Maybe head up, see if Emily
left anything in her office?

23:38.959 --> 23:42.372
- Okay.
- How you doing, buddy? You all right?

23:55.935 --> 23:57.266
(singsong voice)
Rise and shine.

24:03.609 --> 24:07.272
So that's, uh, that's a pretty formal suit
to get piss-drunk in.

24:07.738 --> 24:11.401
I don't suppose I could ask you
to Irish that up for me a little?

24:11.450 --> 24:12.530
(laughs) Sorry.

24:13.953 --> 24:16.820
So do you want to tell me why it is
that you came into the station?

24:17.957 --> 24:21.449
Oh, um, I think I saw
that guy you're looking for.

24:23.337 --> 24:25.123
I don't want a reward.

24:25.172 --> 24:28.209
Um, actually, sir, there is no reward.

24:28.258 --> 24:30.795
Um, Helen--my wife...

24:32.179 --> 24:35.922
she--she always says,
do the right thing.

24:38.310 --> 24:41.052
So then, uh, so this guy that you saw,

24:41.814 --> 24:43.145
did he have a tattoo?

24:43.816 --> 24:47.149
Yeah, a big wiggly snake.

24:47.695 --> 24:48.980
Right there.

24:51.323 --> 24:54.486
How's a guy gonna get a job
with a thing like that, you know?

24:55.494 --> 24:58.236
So according to this dealer,
Reaney bought a boatload of meth?

24:58.288 --> 25:00.665
Yeah. Yeah, but the dealer says
he's not armed.

25:00.749 --> 25:01.909
- Anyway, we still don't have a 20.
- Great.

25:01.959 --> 25:03.119
(knock on door)

25:03.168 --> 25:04.499
- Oh, hi. Come in.
- Um, hi. I've--

25:05.462 --> 25:09.671
I've got a tip... from a guy.
He- -he says that he saw Snake--

25:09.717 --> 25:13.130
um, Reaney--
go into the Birch Leaf on Queen.

25:13.178 --> 25:15.214
- When?
- Hour ago.

25:15.264 --> 25:16.595
Now wh-who's your source?

25:18.350 --> 25:20.136
Take your time.
It's just an escaped killer.

25:20.185 --> 25:22.471
He's a reliable informant.
| see him around the neighborhood.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.762
He just doesn't want Reaney
to know that he snitched.

25:24.815 --> 25:27.101
Well, Birch Leaf Tavern
rents rooms by the week.

25:27.151 --> 25:28.186
It could be legit.

25:29.778 --> 25:31.109
I guess we should check it out.

25:31.155 --> 25:33.146
- Thank you.
- Okay.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.453
I don't even know what I'm looking for.

25:41.498 --> 25:42.704
Files, probably.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.499
So after a little coercing,

25:46.545 --> 25:49.537
buddy downstairs copped to seeing Emily

25:50.257 --> 25:51.588
about half an hour ago.

25:51.633 --> 25:53.169
Two of Anton's guys were with her.

25:53.719 --> 25:56.552
Did they, um...
Listen, do you think she's--

25:56.597 --> 25:59.589
Dead? No, they walked her out
the front door 20 minutes later.

26:00.267 --> 26:01.302
She'll be fine.

26:03.270 --> 26:04.851
Unless they found
what they're looking for.

26:04.897 --> 26:05.977
Then she's dead.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.018
Okay. All right.

26:09.068 --> 26:12.231
l'm Emily. Where would I hide
something of value?

26:12.279 --> 26:15.066
McNally, we don't have time to play
what kind of tree would you be?

26:15.115 --> 26:16.150
Let's--let's go.

26:16.200 --> 26:17.940
Okay. Ow.

26:17.993 --> 26:21.577
Hey, don't tell me where we're going.
Honestly, I'm loving the adventure.

26:21.955 --> 26:24.207
(tires screech)

26:24.750 --> 26:27.082
We need backup, sir.
I mean, if Anton's in his restaurant,

26:28.921 --> 26:30.707
- Not gonna happen.
- But he'll kill her.

26:30.756 --> 26:31.916
I mean, that's what you said.

26:31.965 --> 26:34.707
- We should have every copper in 15--
- I never carded her, okay?

26:37.096 --> 26:38.757
So the department's not responsible.

26:38.806 --> 26:40.091
I did it to keep her safe.

26:40.140 --> 26:42.973
The minute you card a confidential informant,
type their name in the computer,

26:43.018 --> 26:44.724
you might as well put it on the 6:00 news.

26:44.770 --> 26:46.931
I never carded a CI. in my life.

26:46.980 --> 26:49.107
It's only a problem 'cause I got burned.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.849
You mean because I burned you.

26:52.778 --> 26:55.235
Okay, get out of the car.
You got a bunch of paperwork to file.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.486
Get in there and start filing it.

26:56.532 --> 26:57.942
Will you at least tell me where you're going?

26:57.991 --> 27:00.448
I'm going to find Emily, okay?
What else am I gonna do?

27:00.494 --> 27:01.825
I don't got any better ideas.

27:01.870 --> 27:04.282
And I'm gonna be coloring
way outside the lines here, McNally,

27:04.331 --> 27:05.867
and I don't get the feeling
you're that kind of girl.

27:10.212 --> 27:12.077
(tires screech, car departs)

27:16.969 --> 27:17.958
(sirens wailing)

27:18.011 --> 27:20.468
(woman on radio)
All units, cars 1505 and 1519

27:20.514 --> 27:22.129
are en route to the Birch Leaf Tavern.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.715
Don Reaney Jr. is in room 212.

27:25.102 --> 27:28.014
1502, 1521,
please attend for assistance.

27:28.522 --> 27:29.887
(Shaw on radio)
Kill the sirens on your approach.

27:31.942 --> 27:33.352
(Noelle on radio) This is Williams.
We'll take the back.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.866
This is Shaw. We're going to head up
through the front doors.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.323
(door squeaks)

27:46.999 --> 27:48.830
(creak)

27:48.876 --> 27:50.366
All right, I'm gonna cover the back stairs.

27:50.419 --> 27:53.786
- Just stay here, okay? Don't move!
- Okay. Not a muscle, ma'am.

27:56.592 --> 27:59.880
(men speaking indistinctly)

28:01.555 --> 28:03.261
Police! Don't move!
Hands in the--

28:03.307 --> 28:06.014
On your knees! Do not move!
On your knees!

28:10.939 --> 28:12.930
Police! Hands in the air!

28:17.112 --> 28:18.818
(siren wailing)

28:18.864 --> 28:20.946
Peck!
Why didn't you follow him?

28:21.241 --> 28:22.572
You told me not to move.

28:23.660 --> 28:25.116
Terrific!

28:26.663 --> 28:28.449
Noelle!
Have you got him down there?

28:28.498 --> 28:29.533
That's a negative.

28:29.583 --> 28:31.073
Guys, we gotta roll on this.

28:31.126 --> 28:32.707
10 bucks says he's headed
toward the campus.

28:32.753 --> 28:34.664
(Shaw on radio)
Reaney just jumped out the window.

28:34.713 --> 28:35.953
He is on street level.

28:40.177 --> 28:41.166
(siren wailing)

28:41.220 --> 28:43.176
(Shaw) You guys take 9. We're going 12.

28:43.972 --> 28:45.087
(Noelle) Roger.

28:46.683 --> 28:49.015
(siren continues wailing)

28:54.566 --> 28:56.352
Take 3. That's east.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.858
Be careful. Stay on your radio.

28:58.904 --> 28:59.893
Yes, sir.

29:01.949 --> 29:04.531
(indistinct police radio chatter)

29:13.919 --> 29:15.875
This is Epstein. | see Reaney.

29:15.921 --> 29:18.128
He's heading east behind the Cameron Library.

29:20.717 --> 29:23.129
- I need backup.
- (on radio) This is Peck heading southeast.

29:34.106 --> 29:35.346
Police! Stop!

29:35.399 --> 29:36.809
(Reaney grunts)
- Stop!

29:37.025 --> 29:40.062
Hey, hey, hey!
Calm down. Calm down.

29:40.404 --> 29:42.190
It's cool. I know what you're
thinking right now.

29:42.239 --> 29:44.355
I do. You're thinking
you could tear my head off

29:44.408 --> 29:45.523
with your bare hands, right?

29:45.951 --> 29:47.111
You're thinking, where are the real cops?

29:47.536 --> 29:49.276
When are they gonna get here, huh?

29:49.830 --> 29:51.286
- Guess what, ass box?
- Aah!

29:51.331 --> 29:54.323
I am the real cops! (laughs)
How do you like--

29:55.252 --> 29:56.287
I'll take it from here. You look tired.

29:56.336 --> 29:57.872
- Gail, what are you doing? Wait--
- I need it more than you do.

29:57.921 --> 29:59.707
No, no, you don't. That's my collar.
I got here first.

29:59.756 --> 30:02.623
Oh, what can I say?
90% luck, 10% timing.

30:03.719 --> 30:05.175
(breathing heavily)

30:09.224 --> 30:10.725
Nice work, Peck.

30:11.977 --> 30:13.638
Hey, come on, sir. Let's shake a leg.

30:16.523 --> 30:17.979
(inhales)

30:24.323 --> 30:25.654
(beeps)

30:26.575 --> 30:28.611
I thought you'd like to know
your tip panned out.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.696
We don't give out plaques
or anything, but thanks.

30:30.746 --> 30:32.486
Oh, happy I could help.

30:33.123 --> 30:35.956
So you can cruise
if you feel sober enough.

30:36.001 --> 30:39.459
(chuckles)
I've been sober 20 years.

30:40.630 --> 30:42.211
Married 33.

30:43.633 --> 30:45.373
Fell off the wagon today.

30:46.803 --> 30:49.135
Hey, um, I'm glad you caught the guy.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.304
Well, you did a good thing, Walter.

30:51.641 --> 30:53.597
Your wife--Helen, right?

30:54.019 --> 30:55.259
She'll be proud.

30:56.104 --> 30:59.517
Yeah, well, she'll never know.

31:00.859 --> 31:04.852
l, uh, went to her funeral this morning.

31:43.402 --> 31:44.892
(gun cocks)

31:57.416 --> 31:58.826
- How'd you know?
- Know what?

31:59.292 --> 32:01.157
We had, like, 80 tips today.

32:01.211 --> 32:04.248
How'd you know the old drunk guy
who threw up was legit?

32:04.297 --> 32:07.789
Better yet, how'd you convince
Detective Barber to follow up on it?

32:07.843 --> 32:11.176
Well, I didn't exactly tell him
who it came from.

32:12.889 --> 32:16.302
- You lied.
- I believed the guy, okay?

32:16.351 --> 32:18.683
I mean, fine,
I bent the rules a little bit.

32:18.728 --> 32:20.309
But it paid off.

32:20.355 --> 32:22.641
We earned our way into the platoon,
thank you very much.

32:22.691 --> 32:23.976
- You need to lighten up.
- No, no, no.

32:24.025 --> 32:25.856
You need to tighten up.

32:25.902 --> 32:28.109
Well, that's how we make
a good pair, Chris--

32:28.155 --> 32:29.816
the slut and Mr. Manual,
getting the job done.

32:29.865 --> 32:31.150
I did not call you a slut.

32:31.199 --> 32:33.360
You know, that guy was married 33 years.

32:33.410 --> 32:35.696
She meant everything to him.
I mean, imagine that--

32:35.745 --> 32:37.997
losing the thing you care about
most in the whole world.

32:41.585 --> 32:42.620
(under breath)
Something of value.

32:45.046 --> 32:47.037
- Traci, I need your car.
- For what?

32:47.090 --> 32:48.330
- Swarek told you to stay put.
- Ugh.

32:48.383 --> 32:50.248
| just need to check something. Please.

32:50.302 --> 32:51.917
(keys jangle)
Thank you.

32:57.392 --> 32:58.973
(door opens, creaks)

33:15.494 --> 33:18.156
I'd be a willow, Officer Swarek,
if I were a tree.

33:18.205 --> 33:19.661
Just so you know.

33:23.418 --> 33:25.750
(indistinct police radio chatter)

33:25.795 --> 33:29.879
(cell phone dialing)

33:29.966 --> 33:31.706
So what, it's a steel-key USB drive?

33:31.760 --> 33:32.966
Yeah. Can it be copied?

33:33.011 --> 33:34.626
Yeah, sure, if you work at the Pentagon.

33:34.679 --> 33:36.465
Yeah, but I thought that,
you know, the Vanier case--

33:36.515 --> 33:37.630
you cracked a bunch of passwords.

33:37.682 --> 33:39.422
Not with that level of encryption.
No way.

33:39.768 --> 33:42.134
(cell phone rings)

33:42.729 --> 33:44.139
You gonna answer that?

33:44.189 --> 33:45.178
(ring)

33:45.649 --> 33:46.684
No, I'm good.

33:49.236 --> 33:51.648
You move heroin through this place, too?

33:53.281 --> 33:54.441
(scoffs)

33:54.491 --> 33:56.482
So, uh, where's Emily?

33:58.828 --> 34:00.284
(sighs) Emily.

34:00.330 --> 34:01.536
Starling. Your accountant?

34:01.581 --> 34:03.867
Adding something up
somewhere, I guess.

34:03.917 --> 34:05.032
I mean, how would I know?

34:05.085 --> 34:06.700
Just give her back to me, Anton.

34:06.753 --> 34:10.917
Come on. I got an entire task force
dedicated to taking you down.

34:10.966 --> 34:13.548
- I can have a hundred cops here in a minute.
- I really doubt that.

34:13.593 --> 34:15.424
Try me.

34:15.470 --> 34:16.971
No, you got no task force.

34:17.639 --> 34:20.346
You screwed up.
Now you're on your own.

34:20.392 --> 34:22.758
And you're still trying to be the hero.

34:22.811 --> 34:24.767
lt's Emily, or I take you in.

34:25.564 --> 34:26.804
Take me in?

34:27.440 --> 34:28.771
For what?

34:28.817 --> 34:30.148
You got nothing.

34:31.403 --> 34:33.644
If you hurt her, so help me...

34:35.532 --> 34:36.521
People get hurt.

34:37.534 --> 34:38.819
It happens.

34:39.619 --> 34:41.280
But not usually cops.

34:41.329 --> 34:44.071
So now maybe you should just, uh,

34:44.124 --> 34:45.614
walk away.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.158
The perimeter's secure, sir.

34:50.422 --> 34:51.537
Officer McNally.

34:52.048 --> 34:53.333
I brought the files.

35:02.434 --> 35:03.640
Your accounting files.

35:04.603 --> 35:07.595
Emily made a copy.
Proves you're laundering money.

35:07.647 --> 35:09.228
At least we can get you for somethin'.

35:09.274 --> 35:10.480
Let's see.

35:10.525 --> 35:13.767
Emily first. Or I turn this in.

35:13.820 --> 35:17.859
You can go to prison, which, believe me,
would make me a happy, happy man.

35:25.957 --> 35:28.699
Let me ask you something.
How many copies of that did you make?

35:29.794 --> 35:30.783
None.

35:30.837 --> 35:32.919
What? I'm supposed to believe you?

35:32.964 --> 35:34.545
You have my word.

35:42.766 --> 35:43.755
Is this it?

35:45.477 --> 35:46.466
I said, is that it?

35:46.519 --> 35:47.679
Yes.

35:50.273 --> 35:52.264
It sure doesn't look like much, does it?

35:53.234 --> 35:56.317
lfl had this, I'd have my case.

35:56.696 --> 35:58.812
Eight months of my life
would have meant something.

36:01.409 --> 36:02.660
Take her outside.

36:16.049 --> 36:18.040
If I find out there's a copy,

36:19.010 --> 36:20.295
our little deal's off.

36:22.430 --> 36:23.886
And I will find her.

36:31.356 --> 36:33.312
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

36:34.693 --> 36:35.978
(Sam) Were those the real files?

36:39.197 --> 36:40.232
Did you get a copy?

36:40.782 --> 36:42.443
l--it's encrypted. You can't.

36:43.868 --> 36:45.028
What about you?

36:45.745 --> 36:48.487
If I did, it's my insurance
for when l disappear.

36:50.917 --> 36:51.997
You okay, Em?

36:54.045 --> 36:55.034
Come here.

37:03.263 --> 37:04.969
I'm sorry. I didn't know what to do.

37:05.014 --> 37:06.049
You broke some rules.

37:07.016 --> 37:08.301
You disobeyed my order.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.219
You acted like a cop.

37:34.419 --> 37:36.876
We were a good team, me and you.

37:36.921 --> 37:38.582
(woman) .l‘ I'm not trying to be... .l‘

37:38.631 --> 37:40.007
Even if it all went to hell.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.665
(Emily) I am gonna miss you.

37:42.719 --> 37:47.884
(woman) .l‘ ...lying 'cause I'm shy
and I do not want you to see... J‘

37:47.932 --> 37:49.593
- I can take it.
- I know. I got it.

37:50.852 --> 37:53.138
All right.

37:53.188 --> 37:56.351
.l‘ Yeah, you heard what I said J‘

37:56.399 --> 38:00.108
.l‘ There's music in the background .l‘

38:00.153 --> 38:03.395
.l‘ And our rain falls on the roof .l‘

38:03.448 --> 38:06.406
.l‘ I'm tryin' to be polite, but I... .l‘

38:07.577 --> 38:10.159
So is it normal to be scared
when you're making your first arrest?

38:10.914 --> 38:13.280
ljust felt so alone, you know?

38:14.292 --> 38:17.534
That beeyotch totally stole my arrest.

38:17.587 --> 38:20.249
I mean, I took Snakeface down
single-handedly.

38:20.298 --> 38:23.040
- She swoops in there at the last minute--
- Single-handedly?

38:23.092 --> 38:24.127
Yes.

38:24.427 --> 38:26.088
Man, let it go. There'll be more.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.297
Said the babe magnet.

38:27.347 --> 38:30.464
Have you noticed that women are more
attracted to you now that you're a cop?

38:30.517 --> 38:32.428
Uh, yes. You're just now noticing this?

38:35.230 --> 38:36.470
What's up?

38:36.689 --> 38:37.940
You remember what we were
talking about before--

38:37.982 --> 38:39.313
the whole slut thing?

38:39.943 --> 38:42.810
I meant that you were
more of a-a free spirit.

38:43.947 --> 38:45.027
Well, you know what?

38:46.241 --> 38:47.651
I'm not as free as you think.

38:50.870 --> 38:51.859
(Andy) Hey, hey.

38:51.913 --> 38:53.653
Well, great. Way to go.

38:53.706 --> 38:54.912
(clink)
Babe magnet.

38:54.958 --> 38:56.038
(laughs) All right.

38:56.084 --> 38:58.541
Thanks for the wheels.
I gassed it up.

38:58.586 --> 39:00.872
Nice!
I guess the stars do lie.

39:00.922 --> 39:04.255
Well... No.
'Cause they got my day totally right.

39:12.100 --> 39:13.340
Officer Nash.

39:15.228 --> 39:16.513
You still got that knife?

39:19.732 --> 39:20.938
I don't know.

39:21.526 --> 39:22.936
Maybe. Somewhere.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.646
I'm cutting the no-strings, Jerry.

39:27.699 --> 39:28.859
(case lock clicks open)

39:28.908 --> 39:30.523
Okay.

39:31.286 --> 39:33.197
I don't even know what that means.

39:33.246 --> 39:35.988
- It means thank you...
- Mm-hmm.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.029
...for the gift.

39:37.083 --> 39:41.247
And, uh, I would be delighted
to have dinner with you.

39:41.713 --> 39:42.702
Dinner?

39:43.464 --> 39:44.590
New rules--

39:45.258 --> 39:46.543
Take 'em or leave 'em.

39:51.681 --> 39:53.012
Okay.

39:54.225 --> 39:57.763
.l‘ There's music in the background .l‘

39:57.812 --> 40:01.100
.l‘ The rain falls on the roof .l‘

40:02.567 --> 40:03.773
(keys jangle)

40:06.571 --> 40:07.606
Sir?

40:08.573 --> 40:09.904
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:10.074 --> 40:11.939
Hey, um, listen.

40:11.993 --> 40:14.735
How do you know Anton Hill
is not gonna follow Emily out west?

40:15.663 --> 40:16.652
Huh?

40:16.706 --> 40:17.821
Well, we put her on a bus to Kelowna.

40:17.874 --> 40:20.115
How do you know he's not
gonna go there and kill her?

40:20.168 --> 40:21.533
Well, she didn't go to Kelowna.

40:22.337 --> 40:23.326
Oh.

40:24.380 --> 40:26.211
It's not that I don't trust you.
ltjust seems like,

40:26.257 --> 40:28.088
uh, the fewer people who know...

40:28.509 --> 40:30.420
Right. Yeah, yeah.

40:31.888 --> 40:34.174
You really gave up
the whole case for her, huh?

40:36.017 --> 40:37.097
Yeah, well...

40:38.478 --> 40:39.684
Who knows what I gave up?

40:40.271 --> 40:42.432
Maybe nothing.
Emily's smart that way.

40:43.858 --> 40:45.018
Were you scared in there?

40:50.156 --> 40:52.397
Yeah. You?

40:54.786 --> 40:55.775
No.

40:55.828 --> 40:59.286
I mean, you were there.

41:06.798 --> 41:07.878
Let me take you home.

41:09.425 --> 41:10.460
(laughs)

41:12.595 --> 41:14.051
McNally...

41:18.643 --> 41:21.100
Oh, I can't, I can't.

41:21.145 --> 41:25.263
I can't do this. I'm sorry.
It's just that this is my first week at work.

41:29.153 --> 41:31.269
Yeah, well, like I said,
you're not my type, right?

41:33.366 --> 41:34.822
Disregard?

41:34.867 --> 41:36.858
(clinking keys)

41:36.911 --> 41:38.412
Disregard.

41:38.454 --> 41:42.743
(In-Flight Safety)
J‘ All these years have made you a soldier .l‘

41:42.792 --> 41:45.534
.l‘ You're carrying the weight .l‘

41:45.586 --> 41:49.454
.l‘ of two worlds on your shoulder .l‘

41:49.507 --> 41:56.504
.l‘ And I don't have that long now
till I fall over .l‘

41:56.556 --> 42:03.223
.l‘ And your silent... .l‘
