Come on, you lazy Cro-Magnon!

00:38.747 --> 00:41.625
Ohh!

00:44.461 --> 00:48.589
Hey! Back to work! You guys
had a break two days ago!

00:48.590 --> 00:51.138
Come on, now!

00:55.222 --> 00:59.272
Come on, Sheba! That's my big girl!

01:02.521 --> 01:05.397
Look at those pathetic worms

01:05.399 --> 01:08.234
burrowing their lives away.

01:08.235 --> 01:11.529
Do you know why I'm up here and
they're down there, Miss Stone?

01:11.530 --> 01:14.115
Because you lied on your resume?

01:14.116 --> 01:16.075
No.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.829
Because I have vision.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.956
And right now I have a
vision of you and me...

01:21.957 --> 01:25.167
Dripping with coconut oil
on a beach in Rocapulco...

01:25.168 --> 01:29.093
With Mr. Slate's fortune
to keep us company.

01:31.341 --> 01:34.685
I'm glad we see eye to eye.

01:38.682 --> 01:42.101
And somewhere down there
is the ignorant stooge

01:42.102 --> 01:46.022
who will make all my
schemes come true.

01:53.530 --> 01:57.199

Hey! Watch it, will ya?
Finally got my hair the way I like it.

04:07.372 --> 04:10.791
I'm so excited, Fred.
I'm gonna be a father.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.793
It's like a dream come true.

04:12.794 --> 04:17.089
A son. Someone to carry on
the proud name of Rubble.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.591
Think I'll be a good daddy, Fred?

04:18.591 --> 04:20.843
Well, you're bound to find
something you're good at.

04:20.844 --> 04:23.188
Yeah, sure... Hey!

04:26.475 --> 04:29.727
- Uncle!
- Heh, heh, heh.

04:29.728 --> 04:32.938
You know, Fred, Betty and
I really owe it all to you.

04:32.939 --> 04:36.233
We would've never qualified to adopt had
it not been for the money you gave us.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.694
Remember, Barn,
that's between you and me.

04:38.695 --> 04:42.531
I'd like to tell the world what
a great guy my best buddy is!

04:42.532 --> 04:44.200
No, no, no!

04:44.201 --> 04:47.953
True, it was a selfless, noble act,
if I do say so myself.

04:47.954 --> 04:50.414
My only reward will
be your happiness.

04:50.415 --> 04:53.417
I don't need to go blabbin'
my good deeds all around.

04:53.418 --> 04:58.149
You're afraid to tell
Wilma, aren't you?

05:00.217 --> 05:03.552
Afraid? Now, let's get
this straight, Rubble.

05:03.553 --> 05:06.889
I don't need permission from
my wife to make a decision.

05:06.890 --> 05:10.226
In my cave, I reign supreme!

05:10.227 --> 05:12.478
Su-preme!

05:12.479 --> 05:16.233
- I won't tell her, Fred.
- Thanks, pal.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.892
Hiya, Timmy!

05:51.893 --> 05:54.311
Here you go! Shoot, shoot, shoot!

05:54.312 --> 05:56.280
Hey, Charlie!

06:14.291 --> 06:17.209
- Huh?
- Wilma!

06:17.210 --> 06:20.129
I'm home!

06:22.799 --> 06:25.593
No, Dino! No, no! No, Dino! Bad boy!

06:27.888 --> 06:31.015
Bad dog!

06:31.016 --> 06:33.642
- Good doggie!
- Bad Dino breath.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.644
Fred!

06:35.645 --> 06:38.814
Do you have to get Dino so
wound up when you come home?

06:38.815 --> 06:42.151
It's not my fault. Maybe he'd
calm down if we had him fixed!

06:42.152 --> 06:45.326
What?

06:49.492 --> 06:51.994
Here comes the big Daddysaurus!

06:58.001 --> 07:00.753
How was your day, dear?

07:00.754 --> 07:03.589
I think my Brontocrane's
pregnant again.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.883
I tell ya,

07:05.884 --> 07:09.136
you forget to lock her
up one Saturday night...

07:09.137 --> 07:12.681
- Comfortable, Fred?
- On my way.

07:12.682 --> 07:16.518
All I need's a brew and a good scratch.
Which one do you want to do first?

07:16.519 --> 07:19.521
It does my heart good
to see you relaxing

07:19.522 --> 07:21.607
after a hard day at the quarry.

07:21.608 --> 07:24.485
I'm telling you, I married
the pick of the litter.

07:26.029 --> 07:29.823
Fred, our garbage disposal
has been acting up a lot lately,

07:29.824 --> 07:33.452
so I decided that it was
time to buy a new one.

07:33.453 --> 07:37.247
But when I went to take money
out of our savings account...

07:37.248 --> 07:40.376
- Guess what?
- New garbage disposal?

07:40.377 --> 07:44.632
New garbage disposal? Why throw
good money down the drain?

07:45.256 --> 07:47.549
There's nothing wrong with this one.

07:47.550 --> 07:50.052
All right, you. Say "ahh."

07:50.053 --> 07:52.096
Uh-uh.

07:56.351 --> 07:59.812
Do you have any idea why there's
no money in our savings account?

08:03.733 --> 08:07.407
There's your problem right there.

08:11.992 --> 08:15.119
All right, you! Spit it out!

08:15.120 --> 08:17.748
Where's the money, Fred?

08:18.915 --> 08:21.458
Something happened to it.
There, I said it.

08:21.459 --> 08:24.420
We have scrimped and
saved for that money.

08:24.421 --> 08:26.755
And every time we get ahead,

08:26.756 --> 08:29.133
you have to go blow it on
some hare-brained scheme!

08:29.134 --> 08:33.929
Now, see here, Wilma!
In this cave, I am the king!

08:33.929 --> 08:36.774
- And...
- And what, Fred?

08:36.933 --> 08:40.357
And you have every right
to know, my queen.

08:41.270 --> 08:43.230
I gave it to Barney.

08:43.231 --> 08:44.732
You what?

08:44.733 --> 08:46.775
I know I should've consulted you,

08:46.776 --> 08:48.944
but Barney Rubble's my neighbor,
my lodge brother

08:48.945 --> 08:52.322
and my best friend since the first
time I went through the fifth grade!

08:52.323 --> 08:53.699
Fred Flintstone!

08:53.700 --> 08:57.579
Wilma, without that money, they
wouldn't be allowed to adopt a baby.

08:58.246 --> 09:01.123
So go ahead, yell,
scream, let the fur fly.

09:01.124 --> 09:04.298
Give the neighbors
something to talk about!

09:08.339 --> 09:11.967
What you have just done
for the Rubbles...

09:11.968 --> 09:15.563
Is the sweetest, most
generous thing I ever heard.

09:16.806 --> 09:19.400
And I adore you for it.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.606
Mmm.

09:25.607 --> 09:27.905
I also bought a new bowling ball.

09:35.158 --> 09:37.326
Wait! Come on, honey!

09:37.327 --> 09:39.955
- Watch your step.
- Sit down.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.665
All right, all together, folks.

09:52.634 --> 09:54.718
Betty, sit down and relax.

09:54.719 --> 09:57.721
Oh, I can't, Wilma. It just hit me.

09:57.722 --> 10:00.641
From now on, I'll be
spending 24 hours a day

10:00.642 --> 10:03.185
attending to the every need
of a helpless little boy.

10:08.108 --> 10:11.193
Then again, maybe it won't be
such a big adjustment after all.

10:14.823 --> 10:16.870
Fred!

10:17.575 --> 10:21.537
And promise you won't say anything like
you did when you saw my sister's baby.

10:21.538 --> 10:25.541
The kid had a tail. Was I supposed
to pretend I didn't notice?

10:25.542 --> 10:30.548
Hello, Mommy and Daddy! I have
someone who wants to meet you!

10:36.136 --> 10:39.389
Well, it's not exactly
what we pictured, but...

10:40.140 --> 10:43.809
- We'll love him like he was our own.
- No, no, no.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.812
This little fellow belongs
to the Hendersons.

10:54.237 --> 10:57.197
- So glad you'll be nursing.
- Congratulations.

10:57.198 --> 11:01.248
Mr. and Mrs. Rubble,
this is your little boy.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.206
Barney, isn't he precious?

11:06.207 --> 11:07.916
Precious? They'd have been
better off with the monkey.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.418
Fred!

11:09.419 --> 11:11.962
- Does he have a name?
- Bamm-Bamm.

11:11.963 --> 11:15.933
- Is that short for somethin'?
- Bamm-Bamm-Bamm.

11:17.427 --> 11:20.429
You'll have to take it
slowly with this one.

11:20.430 --> 11:24.558
He doesn't speak yet, and he's
a little skittish around humans.

11:24.559 --> 11:28.937
But then again, I would be too if I
had been raised by wild mastodons.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.940
Mastodons?

11:31.941 --> 11:34.785
Let's not nitpick.
A mammal's a mammal.

11:35.111 --> 11:39.489
Well, sounds to me like all
he needs is a little lovin'.

11:39.490 --> 11:41.283
Ohh.

11:41.284 --> 11:43.702
Come here, little guy.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.329
Aah! He growled.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.127
It's cute.

11:47.457 --> 11:51.177
It's okay, little guy.
I'm your da-da.

11:58.968 --> 12:02.054
Bamm-Bamm!

12:02.055 --> 12:05.182
Oh! Barney!

12:05.183 --> 12:07.434
- Oh, Betty!
- Bamm-Bamm! No!

12:16.319 --> 12:19.572
Bamm-Bamm! Bamm-Bamm, wait!

12:20.490 --> 12:22.699
<i>Stalactite, stalagmite
Hold your baby very tight</i>

12:36.965 --> 12:39.299
- Come back!
- Come here, little guy!

12:42.136 --> 12:44.846
- Bamm-Bamm! Bamm! Bamm-Bamm!
- Ohhh!

12:44.847 --> 12:46.056
<i>Rock with the caveman</i>

12:46.057 --> 12:47.182
Bamm-Bamm-Bamm-Bamm-Bamm!

12:47.183 --> 12:48.642
<i>Roll with the caveman</i>

12:50.186 --> 12:52.312
<i>Shake to the caveman</i>

12:52.313 --> 12:53.689
<i>Break with the caveman</i>

12:53.690 --> 12:54.982
Oof!

12:54.983 --> 12:58.360
<i>Make with the caveman
Okay, give me a C-A-V-E</i>

12:58.361 --> 13:00.028
Whoa!

13:00.029 --> 13:02.406
<i>M-A-N, Caveman</i>

13:02.407 --> 13:03.991
Whoa!

13:03.992 --> 13:05.826
What an arm!

13:08.997 --> 13:13.377
"And Cinderocka married
the handsome prince, and...

13:21.217 --> 13:24.220
"And they lived happily ever after."

13:51.321 --> 13:53.194
Yeah!

13:57.086 --> 14:00.422
Okay, Brother Flintstone,
we need a strike to win.

14:00.423 --> 14:02.374
Can you do it?

14:02.675 --> 14:04.927
Is the Earth flat?

14:08.931 --> 14:11.725
- Come on, Freddie!
- Come on, hit it!

14:16.939 --> 14:19.157
Come on, twinkle toes.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.790
Fred!

14:34.791 --> 14:38.085
- Waka-waka-woo!
- Waka-waka-woo!

14:38.086 --> 14:40.796
- Wooga-wooga-wee!
- Wooga-wooga-wee!

14:40.797 --> 14:44.257
Piki-piki-piki! Poki-poki-poki!!

14:44.258 --> 14:47.010
Ahhhhhhhh-oooh!

14:47.011 --> 14:49.137
Lava juice!

14:49.138 --> 14:52.808
Hey, can I have everybody's
attention, please?

14:52.809 --> 14:55.060
I would like to propose a toast

14:55.061 --> 14:59.486
to not only a great bowler,
but a great human being.

15:00.316 --> 15:03.443
And no offense to you guys.

15:03.444 --> 15:08.825
"Since I was just a lad often,
I've had the very bestest friend.

15:09.367 --> 15:12.871
"He may be big, he may be loud,

15:13.454 --> 15:16.365
"so you'll never lose him in a crowd.

15:16.666 --> 15:19.543
"But for my friend
the special part...

15:19.544 --> 15:22.796
"Is what's behind his ribs...
His heart."

15:24.797 --> 15:27.467
"I owe my son to him, and now...

15:27.468 --> 15:30.971
"I stand before my peers and vow...

15:30.972 --> 15:35.350
"I'll pay him back,
someday, somehow."

15:38.813 --> 15:41.192
The end.

15:48.406 --> 15:52.786
- That was beautiful, Barn.
- I meant every word of it, Fred.

15:53.119 --> 15:56.247
- Care to join me in a cold one?
- Love to.

16:02.587 --> 16:05.380
It doesn't get any better than this.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.718
Ohh!

16:47.089 --> 16:48.886
No.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.681
Look at him.

16:56.682 --> 16:59.267
Drunk as a skunkosaurus.

16:59.268 --> 17:01.269
Aaaah!

17:01.270 --> 17:03.943
Mother, I can handle this.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.692
What's that old fossil doing here?
Did the tar pits back up again?

17:07.693 --> 17:12.446
Well, somebody has to be here looking
after my daughter and grandchild...

17:12.448 --> 17:15.700
While you're out carousing
with a bunch of Neanderthals.

17:15.701 --> 17:18.453
Oh, really?
Well, for your information,

17:18.454 --> 17:21.122
the lodge no longer
accepts Neanderthals.

17:21.123 --> 17:24.792
He robs your nest egg to bail
out that little troll next door

17:24.794 --> 17:29.130
while my daughter has to
wash her clothes in the river.

17:29.131 --> 17:32.634
- I got half a mind...
- Oh, don't flatter yourself.

17:32.635 --> 17:34.928
That's it! Where's my club, Wilma?

17:34.929 --> 17:37.264
You just try it, fatso!

17:37.265 --> 17:40.308
- If you was a man, I'd knock you...
- Enough! Mother! Fred!

17:40.309 --> 17:43.645
You two should be
ashamed of yourselves!

17:43.646 --> 17:46.731
I've got my hands full
just being ashamed of him.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.483
You got your hands full
when you scratch your neck!

17:48.484 --> 17:49.818
Stop it!

17:49.819 --> 17:51.111
Both of you!

17:51.112 --> 17:55.323
Mother, Fred is a loving
husband and a good provider.

17:55.324 --> 18:00.546
Oh, really? What has he ever
provided you besides shade?

18:00.580 --> 18:02.872
Oh, Wilma.

18:02.873 --> 18:05.458
You could've married
Elliot Firestone,

18:05.459 --> 18:07.711
the man who invented the wheel.

18:07.712 --> 18:10.338
Instead you picked Fred Flintstone,

18:10.339 --> 18:12.716
the man who invented the excuse.

18:12.717 --> 18:16.595
Let me tell you something, Pearl.
I'm not going to be a nobody all my life.

18:16.596 --> 18:20.348
One of these days, I'm gonna be
a somebody, a real somebody!

18:20.349 --> 18:23.727
We'll live in luxury, and Wilma
will have everything she deserves.

18:23.728 --> 18:26.688
When that day comes,
you'll be so busy eatin' crow

18:26.689 --> 18:29.157
you'll be passing
feathers for a month!

18:30.109 --> 18:33.570
Oh, you poor, poor dear.

18:33.571 --> 18:38.658
And when I think of all the
sacrifices your father made for you.

18:38.659 --> 18:41.244
Lambs, oxen,

18:41.245 --> 18:43.788
your brother Jerry.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.166
- Well...
- Oh, Wilma.

18:46.167 --> 18:48.710
Do your mother a favor.

18:48.711 --> 18:51.379
Just call Elliot Firestone.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.340
Even if things don't work out,

18:53.341 --> 18:56.635
he can give you a great
deal on some tires.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.888
- Yes, Mother.
- Byesie-bye.

18:59.889 --> 19:02.265
I'll show her. I'll show everybody.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.392
I know you will, Fred.

19:04.393 --> 19:07.897
- Call me fatso.
- Let's get some sleep.

19:29.251 --> 19:31.503
Hey, what's the special?

19:41.597 --> 19:43.770
This job sucks.

19:46.519 --> 19:49.646
- What you got today?
- Lizard and onions. Want half?

19:49.647 --> 19:51.444
Sure.

19:55.194 --> 19:58.446
I hear that eatin' too much
red meat is bad for you.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.323
What a load of bunk.

20:00.324 --> 20:04.494
My father ate it every day of his life,
he lived to the ripe old age of 38.

20:04.495 --> 20:06.955
Your attention please.
May I have your attention!

20:06.956 --> 20:09.457
I have a very important
announcement to make.

20:09.458 --> 20:12.210
You found out why the guys
in pit six are losing their hair?

20:12.211 --> 20:13.294
Yes!

20:13.295 --> 20:18.016
And we are currently in the process of
refuting the results of that investigation.

20:18.342 --> 20:20.093
But today I am here

20:20.094 --> 20:21.720
to formally announce the creation

20:21.721 --> 20:25.140
of Slate and Company's
executive placement program.

20:25.941 --> 20:27.934
Hold your questions, please.

20:27.935 --> 20:31.312
That's right, this Saturday an
aptitude test will be given,

20:31.313 --> 20:33.982
granting one of you the opportunity

20:33.983 --> 20:38.570
to crawl out of the primordial
ooze and be somebody.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.822
A vice president at
Slate and Company,

20:40.823 --> 20:45.660
with an obscene salary
and a shiny nameplate.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.620
Ooh.

20:47.621 --> 20:51.341
Good luck, and may
the best biped win.

20:53.043 --> 20:56.838
<i>An executive? This is my
chance to be somebody.</i>

20:56.839 --> 20:59.182
<i>Be somebody.</i>

20:59.759 --> 21:01.593
Whee!

21:03.929 --> 21:06.931
Higher, Bamm-Bamm, higher!

21:06.932 --> 21:10.310
Higher! Higher!

21:10.311 --> 21:12.395
Whee!

21:12.396 --> 21:14.230
- Wilma.
- Hmm?

21:14.231 --> 21:16.024
How did you get rid of the
ring around the collar?

21:16.025 --> 21:18.243
By washing Fred's neck.

21:18.360 --> 21:22.155
Hmm. You know, if Fred scores
the highest on that test,

21:22.156 --> 21:24.616
you'll be able to hire someone
to do your laundry for you.

21:24.617 --> 21:29.454
If Fred scores the highest on that test,
I'll have to hire someone to revive me.

21:31.707 --> 21:34.250
Oh, it's true,
Fred's no Albert Einstone.

21:34.251 --> 21:36.544
- But you never know, he may surprise you.
- Whee!

21:36.545 --> 21:38.588
Well, maybe.

21:38.589 --> 21:41.090
- He has been studying day and night.
- Whee!

21:41.091 --> 21:43.468
I know! I've never
seen him so excited

21:43.469 --> 21:46.513
about something you couldn't
spread mayonnaise on.

21:52.102 --> 21:54.771
Barn, I've been thinking
about this executive job.

21:54.772 --> 21:56.397
It's not me.

21:56.398 --> 21:59.359
Cooped up inside some
swank office all day,

21:59.360 --> 22:01.486
kissing the big shot's feet.

22:01.487 --> 22:03.363
Not Fred Flintstone.

22:03.364 --> 22:05.323
Why, good afternoon, Mr. Vandercave.

22:05.324 --> 22:08.452
My, that's a handsome pelt
you're wearing today.

22:08.453 --> 22:10.078
Thank you.

22:10.079 --> 22:13.581
Your attention, please!
Please take your seats.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.792
And welcome.

22:15.793 --> 22:18.586
You will have one hour
to complete the exam.

22:18.587 --> 22:23.263
Please carve all answers with
a well-sharpened No. 2 chisel.

22:25.135 --> 22:26.886
On behalf of Slate and Company,

22:26.887 --> 22:30.106
I want to wish you all
the very best of luck.

22:33.477 --> 22:35.445
Let's begin.

23:09.179 --> 23:11.022
Eeee!

23:21.108 --> 23:23.906
Ohh.

23:25.154 --> 23:26.997
Chisels down.

23:31.076 --> 23:33.244
Please slide your answer slab

23:33.245 --> 23:35.788
into the numbered envelope provided

23:35.789 --> 23:38.833
and stack them neatly on my desk.

23:38.834 --> 23:42.253
Psst! Hey, Fred! How'd you do?

23:42.254 --> 23:45.089
How'd I do? How'd I do?

23:51.597 --> 23:55.226
- You want me to take that up for you?
- Yeah. Thanks, pal.

24:05.527 --> 24:08.655
<i>"And I stand before my peers and vow,</i>

24:08.656 --> 24:12.376
<i>"I'll pay him back,
someday, somehow."</i>

24:35.349 --> 24:38.309
Well, Cliff, the test results are in.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.311
And our unsuspecting dupe is?

24:40.312 --> 24:44.232
Believe it or not, the one who scored
the highest was Fred Flintstone.

24:44.233 --> 24:47.527
- That big ape?
- No, the big ape got a 65.

24:47.528 --> 24:49.529
Flintstone? Oh, this can't be right!

24:49.530 --> 24:52.573
He must have cheated.
He's dense, he's witless...

24:52.574 --> 24:55.076
He's perfect.

24:55.077 --> 24:57.829
The results of the exam
were very competitive,

24:57.830 --> 25:00.748
and just because an
applicant was not selected...

25:00.749 --> 25:03.584
ls no indication of lack of ability.

25:03.585 --> 25:06.838
- I am pleased to announce...
- I know a kiss-off when I hear one. Let's go.

25:06.839 --> 25:09.090
That the newest member
of our executive rank

25:09.091 --> 25:11.509
is Mr. Fred Flintstone!

25:11.510 --> 25:15.013
- Huh?
- Barney, quick. What's my name?

25:15.014 --> 25:17.306
- Fred Flintstone!
- Don't toy with me, Barney.

25:17.307 --> 25:19.600
You did it, Fred! You made it!

25:19.601 --> 25:22.103
Yabba-dabba-dabba-doo!

26:11.236 --> 26:14.155
Good morning, Mr. Vice President.

26:14.156 --> 26:17.492
Good morning, Mrs. Vice President.

26:21.704 --> 26:24.799
Oh, Dino! Oh, Dino, no!

26:28.170 --> 26:30.421
- Hey!
- Mmm!

26:30.422 --> 26:33.016
Atta baby!

26:37.262 --> 26:40.641
Oh...

26:45.145 --> 26:47.396
Good boy, Dino.

27:08.502 --> 27:10.711
Well, how do I look?

27:10.712 --> 27:13.673
Daddy pretty.

27:13.674 --> 27:15.716
It's perfect!

27:15.717 --> 27:18.553
Yeah. Snazzy.

27:18.554 --> 27:22.515
What am I gonna call
you now? Boss? Chief?

27:22.516 --> 27:25.017
No, a simple "Your Highness" will do.

27:25.718 --> 27:27.562
No, Barn.

27:27.563 --> 27:31.774
I'm not gonna be one of these guys that
makes it then forgets where he came from.

27:31.775 --> 27:36.070
The first thing I'm gonna do is get
everyone in the quarry some vacation time.

27:36.071 --> 27:39.031
And maybe a health plan
with free foot care.

27:39.032 --> 27:42.326
I'd settle for them little packets
of ketchup for the lunch room.

27:42.327 --> 27:45.204
- I'm only one man.
- Not from the back.

27:45.205 --> 27:47.173
Hey, hey.

27:49.960 --> 27:54.761
Well, I guess this is it,
Mr. Flintstone.

27:59.928 --> 28:02.556
Go get 'em, big guy.

28:05.184 --> 28:08.358
- Hey, Barn.
- Yeah, Fred?

28:08.478 --> 28:11.822
Could you spot me a couple
bucks for lunch? I'm a little short.

28:13.442 --> 28:15.615
You're right, Fred.

28:16.403 --> 28:18.530
Nothing's changed.

28:38.800 --> 28:42.178
Welcome aboard, Flintstone!

28:42.179 --> 28:45.379
We're glad you're here. Nice suit!

28:46.183 --> 28:48.267
You know, Fred, any gravel brain

28:48.268 --> 28:52.113
can shovel rock down in
the quarry, but up here...

28:52.189 --> 28:55.983
- Do you know what we do up here?
- Me and the guys have always wondered.

28:55.984 --> 28:58.361
We interface, Flintstone.

28:58.362 --> 29:01.530
We strategize, analyze,

29:01.531 --> 29:03.824
conceptualize, prioritize...

29:03.825 --> 29:05.826
When do we eat?

29:05.827 --> 29:10.873
Fred, until this moment I wasn't
sure we'd picked the right man.

29:10.874 --> 29:13.422
Now I'm certain.

29:20.634 --> 29:22.593
Fred Flintstone,

29:22.594 --> 29:25.188
you've arrived.

29:26.723 --> 29:29.567
- This is my office?
- That's right.

29:29.726 --> 29:31.686
- This is my chair?
- Mmm-hmm.

29:31.687 --> 29:33.688
Not to throw too much
at you on your first day,

29:33.689 --> 29:35.690
but this big thing here is your desk.

29:35.691 --> 29:39.161
- My desk?
- Watch out for your fingers in the drawers.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.532
Am I interrupting?

29:44.533 --> 29:48.327
Not at all. Fred, I'd like you
to meet your new secretary,

29:48.328 --> 29:51.372
- Miss Sharon Stone.
- My secretary?

29:51.373 --> 29:54.250
Personal secretary, Mr. Flintstone.

29:54.251 --> 29:57.800
That is, of course, if you want me.

30:01.425 --> 30:03.009
Great.

30:03.010 --> 30:06.595
Well, I'm sure the two of
you would like to get...

30:06.596 --> 30:09.144
Better acquainted.

30:12.853 --> 30:15.104
Mr. Flintstone, I'd like you to know

30:15.105 --> 30:18.858
that I enjoy working
long hours, late nights,

30:18.859 --> 30:20.568
even weekends.

30:20.569 --> 30:24.405
So feel free to use me

30:24.406 --> 30:27.659
however you see fit.

30:27.909 --> 30:30.244
Now, can I get you anything?

30:30.245 --> 30:33.214
- Coffee?
- Sure.

30:34.750 --> 30:39.096
- How would you like it?
- In a cup?

30:39.379 --> 30:41.597
Bold choice, Mr. Flintstone!

30:41.631 --> 30:44.225
You'll go far in this company.

30:55.771 --> 30:59.732
Take a memo. Cliff, let's play golf.

30:59.733 --> 31:03.944
We can prioritize, conceptualize
and, uh... Tenderize.

31:03.945 --> 31:07.619
Executively yours, Fred Fli... Ah!

31:08.158 --> 31:11.535
Are there six or seven
"I"s in "Fli... Ah"?

31:11.536 --> 31:15.247
- Who said that?
- It was I, your dictabird.

31:15.248 --> 31:18.334
- Dicta-what?
- Dictabird. Read my beak.

31:18.335 --> 31:20.378
"Cliff, let's play golf.

31:20.379 --> 31:24.975
"We can prioritize, conceptualize
and, uh, tenderize."

31:25.258 --> 31:28.307
Wow. Wow!

31:28.387 --> 31:31.972
Mr. Flintstone, I'd like to warn
you that management positions

31:31.973 --> 31:33.349
are fraught with peril.

31:33.350 --> 31:35.810
Whenever you find yourself
in a befuddled state,

31:35.811 --> 31:38.020
I urge you to avail yourself

31:38.021 --> 31:41.445
of my experience and sage advice.

31:41.483 --> 31:42.817
Oh, really?

31:42.818 --> 31:44.819
Listen, birdie, let's get the
pecking order straight here.

31:44.820 --> 31:45.986
Hmm.

31:45.987 --> 31:50.074
I don't need any help from you.
I'm Vice President of...

31:50.075 --> 31:52.623
Of, uh...

31:54.663 --> 31:57.748
Industrial procurement.

31:57.749 --> 32:00.343
How about that? Excuse me.

32:03.338 --> 32:05.385
Hey, guys!

32:05.799 --> 32:07.842
Guess what I am!

32:07.843 --> 32:11.595
Vice President of
Industrial Procurement!

32:16.560 --> 32:19.108
Oy! Whew.

32:20.355 --> 32:22.107
Yeah.

32:22.149 --> 32:25.985
There. I'm all done with
the requisition forms.

32:25.986 --> 32:28.529
What do you think?

32:28.530 --> 32:31.532
It's perfect.

32:31.533 --> 32:33.492
Looks just like the real one.

32:33.493 --> 32:38.414
Mr. Flintstone, you are about to
embezzle a great deal of money.

32:38.415 --> 32:41.876
Unfortunately, for you,
we get to keep it.

32:41.877 --> 32:44.962
We can have Flintstone
sign these right away.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.881
Not just yet.

32:46.882 --> 32:50.759
Creatures like this
Flintstone are primitive,

32:50.760 --> 32:53.637
prone to irrational
bouts of integrity.

32:53.638 --> 32:59.395
We've got to make absolutely
certain he'll do whatever we say.

33:03.106 --> 33:05.524
Fred is the greatest bowler on Earth.

33:05.525 --> 33:08.694
"Fred is the greatest
bowler on Earth."

33:08.695 --> 33:11.363
Now you talk, and see how
much I can remember.

33:12.908 --> 33:14.705
Workin' hard?

33:16.745 --> 33:21.207
Okay, Fred, are you ready for
your first executive action?

33:21.208 --> 33:23.876
Ready and willing. Whatever
you need, consider it done!

33:23.877 --> 33:26.504
Good! I want you to
fire Bernard Rubble.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.923
Done... What? Fire Barney? Why?

33:28.924 --> 33:32.676
Well, for starters, he scored the lowest
on the management aptitude test.

33:32.677 --> 33:36.722
He's an imbecile. The company can't afford
to have dead weight like him on the payroll!

33:36.723 --> 33:40.935
But, Mr. Vandercave,
he's got a new kid, a mortgage.

33:40.936 --> 33:43.646
I'm his best friend. I can't.

33:43.647 --> 33:45.569
Fred...

33:45.732 --> 33:47.274
If you don't fire him,

33:47.275 --> 33:49.276
I will.

33:49.277 --> 33:51.871
And then I'll fire you.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.710
Come on, Fred,
usually you're yakkin' my ear off,

34:06.711 --> 34:08.504
but today you haven't said two words.

34:08.505 --> 34:10.965
Something exciting must
have happened up there.

34:10.966 --> 34:15.516
- You don't want to know, Barn, believe me.
- Sure I do, Fred.

34:15.637 --> 34:18.597
You're the first one of us to
make it out of that quarry.

34:18.598 --> 34:20.139
Look at me.

34:20.141 --> 34:23.235
I'll probably be working
there the rest of my life.

34:23.270 --> 34:24.770
No, you won't, Barn.

34:24.771 --> 34:27.945
Take my word for it.

34:29.317 --> 34:33.320
Come take a look... It's a dish in
the shower, you keep the soap in it.

34:33.321 --> 34:35.072
Barney, there's something
we gotta talk about.

34:35.072 --> 34:36.739
Yeah, yeah. Later, Fred.

34:36.741 --> 34:38.826
Surprise!

34:39.527 --> 34:42.672
Way to go, Fred!

34:54.717 --> 34:57.094
- Wilma, you shouldn't have.
- Hmm?

34:57.094 --> 35:01.724
I didn't. This was all
Barney and Betty's idea.

35:01.725 --> 35:06.186
Aren't we lucky to have
friends like them, Fred?

35:06.187 --> 35:07.896
Ohh!

35:07.897 --> 35:10.190
There he is!

35:10.191 --> 35:13.937
There's my big, handsome son-in-law!

35:16.031 --> 35:18.073
Have you lost weight?

35:18.074 --> 35:20.793
Have we met?

35:21.328 --> 35:23.954
Can I have everybody's
attention, please?

35:23.955 --> 35:25.998
I've got something I'd like to say.

35:25.999 --> 35:29.427
I hope it's not another poem.

35:30.128 --> 35:33.714
Fred... Betty, Bamm-Bamm
and I could not be happier,

35:33.715 --> 35:37.635
- even if it was me that got that job.
- Aww!

35:37.636 --> 35:41.847
So we got a little something to
show how proud of you we are.

35:41.848 --> 35:44.822
Congratulations, big guy!

35:47.312 --> 35:49.271
Barney, I can't accept this.

35:49.272 --> 35:51.398
- Sure, you can.
- No, I can't. Take it back.

35:51.399 --> 35:54.735
- We can't. We had your initials branded on it.
- It's yours, Fred.

35:54.736 --> 35:57.905
- No, it's not!
- Fred, what's wrong with you?

35:57.906 --> 35:59.907
It's a lovely gift.

35:59.908 --> 36:03.207
- He's thrilled to receive it. Aren't you, Fred?
- No!

36:03.411 --> 36:06.246
- Don't you like the color?
- It's not the briefcase, it's not the color.

36:06.247 --> 36:09.041
- I just can't take anything from you.
- But, Fred...

36:09.042 --> 36:11.251
Take a hike, shorty.

36:11.252 --> 36:15.214
My Freddie doesn't
want that tacky thing.

36:15.215 --> 36:18.592
- How come, Fred?
- Because you can't afford it, Barn.

36:20.595 --> 36:22.721
Sure I can, pal.

36:22.722 --> 36:25.432
Not anymore.

36:25.433 --> 36:27.935
- You're fired.
- Fired?

36:34.693 --> 36:36.777
Well!

36:36.778 --> 36:41.454
Let's not let a little thing
like this spoil the party!

36:41.783 --> 36:43.992
Conga line!

36:43.993 --> 36:47.667
Conga! Conga!

36:54.671 --> 36:56.422
Don't worry about me, Fred.

36:56.423 --> 36:59.258
I've been working in that quarry
since it was eight feet deep.

36:59.259 --> 37:00.551
Atta boy!

37:00.552 --> 37:03.637
There could be a whole new
world opening up for me.

37:03.638 --> 37:06.265
Maybe I'll take in that
franchise show this weekend.

37:06.266 --> 37:08.860
That's the spirit.

37:09.352 --> 37:11.645
There's just one thing I gotta know.

37:11.646 --> 37:15.320
After all these years,
how come they're canning me?

37:16.025 --> 37:18.068
Barn,

37:18.069 --> 37:20.195
you're a wonderful father,

37:20.196 --> 37:22.030
a loving husband,

37:22.031 --> 37:24.241
a hard worker,

37:24.242 --> 37:27.244
and one heck of a little bowler.

37:27.245 --> 37:32.125
But, Barn, none of that
counts on an aptitude test.

37:33.543 --> 37:36.887
You got the lowest score, pal.

37:38.047 --> 37:40.641
The lowest score?

38:01.988 --> 38:05.532
Wilma, that is beautiful!

38:05.533 --> 38:08.535
- Well, I have always wanted...
- You can't catch me!

38:08.536 --> 38:12.131
- A Halstone original.
- Mmm.

38:12.624 --> 38:15.709
- Ohh!
- Now, Wilma, don't be silly!

38:15.710 --> 38:18.545
Your husband's a big executive.
You can afford it.

38:18.546 --> 38:21.173
Charge it!

38:27.221 --> 38:29.264
Bamm-Bamm!

38:30.065 --> 38:32.518
Ohh! Bamm-Bamm!

38:32.519 --> 38:35.818
- No!
- Bamm-Bamm! Bamm-Bamm!

38:47.575 --> 38:51.245
Gentlemen, please. I cannot
endorse this modernization...

38:51.246 --> 38:53.580
if it means laying off
all those workers.

38:53.581 --> 38:56.083
Some have been here since
the beginning of time.

38:56.084 --> 38:58.001
What if I could
quadruple your income?

38:58.002 --> 39:01.096
I'll miss them. You were saying?

39:02.924 --> 39:07.094
Sorry I'm late. I had car trouble.
Picked up a nail.

39:07.095 --> 39:09.888
Thank you for sharing
that, Mr. Flagstone.

39:09.889 --> 39:13.438
May we continue?

39:14.769 --> 39:16.937
Mr. Slate. Gentlemen.

39:16.938 --> 39:20.112
I have a vision.

39:21.442 --> 39:24.736
While our competitors are
mired in the Stone Age,

39:24.737 --> 39:27.781
I give you... The future!

39:27.782 --> 39:30.826
- Ohh.
- Slate and Company

39:30.827 --> 39:33.161
will revolutionize the
building industry...

39:33.162 --> 39:35.539
By providing simple,

39:35.540 --> 39:38.463
low-cost, modular housing units.

39:38.626 --> 39:40.752
Impossible, you say?

39:40.753 --> 39:43.051
Let me demonstrate.

39:43.298 --> 39:45.549
Through the miracle
of geothermal power,

39:45.550 --> 39:49.303
the raw material is elevated
to the second stage,

39:49.304 --> 39:51.263
where our steam-powered
conveyor belt carries...

39:51.264 --> 39:52.389
Steam?

39:52.390 --> 39:54.474
He's a madman!

39:54.475 --> 39:57.273
Steam-powered conveyor belts...

39:57.312 --> 40:01.231
Carry the product to be
shaped, cleaned, inspected

40:01.232 --> 40:05.360
and delivered to discerning
consumers worldwide.

40:07.405 --> 40:11.034
And did I mention increasing
our profit margin...

40:11.159 --> 40:14.536
- Fourfold?
- Very impressive, Mr. Vandercave.

40:14.537 --> 40:19.884
Very impressive. I think we should
implement this system immediately.

40:20.835 --> 40:22.878
Yes?

40:22.879 --> 40:25.672
Excuse me, Mr. Slate.
I know I'm the new man here,

40:25.673 --> 40:29.518
but I don't think you hired me
to sit around and look pretty.

40:30.136 --> 40:34.139
I hate to bust your bubble,
but if you build houses this small,

40:34.140 --> 40:36.688
who's gonna live in 'em?

40:42.523 --> 40:45.525
- Excuse me. Mrs. Rubble?
- Yes.

40:45.526 --> 40:49.571
There seems to be a slight
problem with your credit carol.

40:49.572 --> 40:51.657
Really? And what would that be?

40:51.658 --> 40:54.081
It's no damn good!

41:01.626 --> 41:05.253
I have never been so
embarrassed in my entire life.

41:05.254 --> 41:10.092
- Go and play, children.
- Wilma, I promise you I'll pay you back.

41:10.093 --> 41:13.804
- I just don't know when.
- Oh, now, Betty.

41:13.805 --> 41:17.015
- It can't be as bad as all that.
- But it is.

41:17.016 --> 41:20.686
Barney's still out of work, we've
nearly spent all of our savings.

41:20.687 --> 41:25.067
And, Wilma, what if the
adoption agency finds out?

41:28.486 --> 41:31.613
I don't want to lose my baby.

41:31.614 --> 41:36.159
I swear, Betty, Fred and I
would never let that happen.

41:36.160 --> 41:39.288
- Oh, Wilma.
- Oh, Betty.

41:42.750 --> 41:46.336
Pterodactyl alert!

41:46.337 --> 41:49.232
Mommy, help!

41:53.761 --> 41:57.105
- Ow, yuck!
- Ew!

41:57.348 --> 41:59.266
And in conclusion, Mr. Slate,

41:59.267 --> 42:03.103
I feel a paid vacation for everyone
in the quarry would raise morale

42:03.104 --> 42:07.359
and increase productivity,
um, um... A whole bunch!

42:07.608 --> 42:10.444
Sincerely yours,
Frederick J. Flintstone.

42:10.445 --> 42:13.949
Shall I make that "Flagstone,"
so he'll know who it's from?

42:14.115 --> 42:16.950
My, don't we look handsome today?

42:16.951 --> 42:19.036
Thank you.

42:19.037 --> 42:21.329
Here are today's batch
of requisitions.

42:21.330 --> 42:24.959
- All marked and ready for your signature.
- Okay.

42:25.626 --> 42:27.127
You know, Miss Stone,

42:27.128 --> 42:32.600
I've been signing stacks of these for weeks,
and I hate to pry, but what are they?

42:33.051 --> 42:34.968
Oh, just tiny little forms

42:34.969 --> 42:38.814
so that we can pay the contractors
working on the modernization.

42:41.225 --> 42:43.852
We remodeled our kitchen
a couple of years ago,

42:43.853 --> 42:48.815
and let me tell you,
contractors can be real pirates.

42:48.816 --> 42:52.286
- I'm gonna read these over.
- No!

42:53.654 --> 42:58.000
You're much too busy
for that, Mr. Flintstone.

42:58.284 --> 42:59.659
Besides,

42:59.660 --> 43:02.537
reading is my job.

43:02.538 --> 43:05.874
You wouldn't want to
put poor little old me

43:05.875 --> 43:08.251
out of work, now, would you?

43:08.252 --> 43:09.979
No.

43:14.717 --> 43:17.385
Your wife. Mmm-mmm.

43:17.386 --> 43:20.222
- Your wife.
- My wife. Wilma?

43:20.223 --> 43:23.850
- Wilma! What a surprise!
- So it would seem.

43:23.851 --> 43:26.853
Miss Stone, I'd like you to
meet my wife Mrs. Flagstone...

43:26.854 --> 43:29.731
And our daughter, um... Um, um, um...

43:29.732 --> 43:31.942
Isn't she beautiful? My family.

43:31.943 --> 43:35.697
- I've heard so much about you.
- Well, I wish that I could say the same.

43:35.780 --> 43:37.280
That'll be all, Miss Stone.

43:37.281 --> 43:39.449
I'll sign those documents and
place them on your desk.

43:39.450 --> 43:42.044
Whatever you want.

43:46.874 --> 43:51.211
- Your secretary is very attractive.
- Really? I hadn't noticed.

43:51.212 --> 43:53.213
Did I mention she chisels
18 words a minute?

43:53.214 --> 43:54.840
Hmm.

43:55.883 --> 43:59.313
Hey, Wilma, did ya
ever see one of these?

44:00.763 --> 44:03.598
My wife is the most
beautiful gal in Bedrock.

44:03.599 --> 44:05.684
"My wife is the most
beautiful gal in Bedrock."

44:05.685 --> 44:07.402
Nice try, Fred.

44:07.562 --> 44:10.063
"Nice try, Fred."

44:10.064 --> 44:14.317
Fred! I've come to talk about
the Rubbles' troubles.

44:14.318 --> 44:16.236
Hasn't Barney found a job yet?

44:16.237 --> 44:20.490
It's gotten so bad, they've had to rent
out their house just to make ends meet.

44:20.491 --> 44:24.040
Really. Where are they gonna live?

44:29.065 --> 44:31.918
So glad you're over your cold.

44:31.919 --> 44:34.547
Thank you.

44:43.306 --> 44:45.265
Isn't this nice, Betty?

44:45.266 --> 44:48.768
The Flintstones and the
Rubbles, all under one roof.

44:48.769 --> 44:52.981
Yes, but this is such an imposition.
Are you sure it's okay with Fred?

44:52.982 --> 44:55.442
Oh, absolutely.

44:55.443 --> 44:58.445
As a matter of fact,
he thinks it was his idea.

45:00.114 --> 45:04.492
- Hey, Freddie, a couple of cool ones.
- Oh, yeah.

45:08.664 --> 45:11.625
How about it, Barn?

45:11.626 --> 45:15.795
- Flintstones and Rubbles under one roof.
- But it's only temporary.

45:15.796 --> 45:17.843
It'd better be.

45:20.551 --> 45:22.552
- It'd better be!
- Yeah!

45:22.553 --> 45:26.097
Ah, Barn, I admire ya.
You've lost your job, your dignity,

45:26.098 --> 45:27.599
but not your sense of humor.

45:29.727 --> 45:32.401
Hey, cut it out, Fred!

45:34.357 --> 45:36.358
You like your steak rare?

45:36.359 --> 45:38.443
- Yeah.
- That one's yours.

45:38.444 --> 45:41.279
Hey, hey, stop! Come here,
you purple rodent!

45:42.990 --> 45:45.992
Don't forget to wash that
off before you eat it!

45:45.993 --> 45:48.245
Come here! Give me that!

45:49.789 --> 45:51.831
Help! Somebody!

46:19.527 --> 46:21.486
Flintstone gets the rock.

46:21.487 --> 46:23.739
He sets his shot. He shoots!

46:24.407 --> 46:26.204
Oh!

46:28.202 --> 46:30.412
Oh! Oh, boy.

46:30.413 --> 46:32.706
Miss Stone, what a pleasant surprise.

46:32.707 --> 46:35.380
Oh. What happened here?

46:36.168 --> 46:39.838
- That's what I'd like to know!
- I'll get someone to fix it.

46:39.839 --> 46:41.840
Oh, Miss Stone?

46:41.841 --> 46:44.801
Before you go, there's
something bothering me...

46:44.802 --> 46:47.887
- About this new system we're putting in here.
- Oh?

46:47.888 --> 46:50.515
Yeah. I don't pretend
to understand it all,

46:50.516 --> 46:53.189
but wouldn't this put a lot
of my guys out of work?

46:53.227 --> 46:54.477
How would I know?

46:54.478 --> 46:57.197
I'm just a little ol' secretary.

46:57.273 --> 46:59.899
Are you kiddin' me? You're smart!

46:59.900 --> 47:01.860
I could tell that right off.

47:01.861 --> 47:05.405
There's a lot more to you
than you... Er... Uh...

47:05.906 --> 47:08.784
- You... I mean...
- Thank you.

47:13.622 --> 47:18.918
I sure hope I didn't get you into too much
trouble with your wife the other day.

47:18.919 --> 47:23.256
Nah. Wilma always forgives me.
She knows I love her.

47:23.257 --> 47:25.717
- And you do, don't you?
- Are you kiddin"?

47:25.718 --> 47:29.721
I'll never forget, the first time I met
her she was working at a restaurant.

47:29.722 --> 47:34.272
I won this "All You Can Eat" contest and
she was the one that cleaned me off.

47:34.769 --> 47:37.520
Every night I go home and
look at her and I think,

47:37.521 --> 47:41.651
"What is a beautiful woman like that
doing with a big galoot like me?"

47:44.362 --> 47:47.331
I think I know.

47:49.950 --> 47:52.160
- Where have you been?
- With Fred.

47:52.161 --> 47:54.504
I mean, Mr. Flintstone.

47:55.039 --> 47:56.206
I'm worried, Cliff.

47:56.207 --> 47:57.957
He's smarter than we thought.

47:57.958 --> 48:00.794
He'd have to be to get himself
dressed in the morning.

48:00.795 --> 48:02.712
He's been asking a lot of questions.

48:02.713 --> 48:05.965
I think we should just
call the whole thing off.

48:05.966 --> 48:09.469
No. No, I've got a better idea.

48:09.470 --> 48:12.348
Why don't we turn ourselves in,

48:12.473 --> 48:15.475
then we can rot in jail until
the poles freeze over.

48:15.476 --> 48:16.643
I was just thinking...

48:16.644 --> 48:19.397
Stick to your strengths, Miss Stone.

48:20.856 --> 48:23.404
And I'll stick to mine.

48:24.068 --> 48:25.990
Besides,

48:26.779 --> 48:32.001
if Mr. Flintstone insists
on being so conscientious,

48:32.326 --> 48:35.328
perhaps we can give Fred...

48:35.329 --> 48:38.628
Something to take his
mind off work, hmm?

48:40.167 --> 48:42.335
- A bonus?
- That's right, Fred!

48:42.336 --> 48:44.759
- You deserve it.
- For what?

48:45.131 --> 48:47.715
Don't be modest, you go-getter, you!

48:47.716 --> 48:50.677
And Fred, let me let
you in on a little secret.

48:50.678 --> 48:54.347
If you really want to become a
top executive at this company,

48:54.348 --> 48:58.227
you've got to start living like one.

49:08.028 --> 49:12.203
<i>Yabba-dabba-doo!</i>

49:14.285 --> 49:17.120
<i>Flintstones
Meet the Flintstones</i>

49:17.121 --> 49:21.082
<i>They're the modern
Stone Age family</i>

49:21.083 --> 49:23.460
<i>From the town of Bedrock</i>

49:23.461 --> 49:25.044
<i>They're a page right out of history</i>

49:25.045 --> 49:27.547
- Good afternoon, madam.
- Full serve, please.

49:27.548 --> 49:28.923
<i>Let's ride</i>

49:28.924 --> 49:30.967
<i>With the family down the street</i>

49:30.968 --> 49:34.387
<i>Through the courtesy
of Fred's two feet</i>

49:34.388 --> 49:37.557
<i>When you're with the Flintstones</i>

49:37.558 --> 49:40.393
<i>Have a yabba-dabba-doo time
A dabba-doo time</i>

49:40.394 --> 49:41.936
Oh, dear!

49:41.937 --> 49:45.064
<i>We'll have a gay old time</i>

50:00.164 --> 50:01.665
Good boy.

50:02.082 --> 50:05.335
Good, Wilma! Use your arms.
Perfect. That's four.

50:05.336 --> 50:08.588
Betty! Towel.

50:08.589 --> 50:10.965
Keep going. Go eight.
Strong, tight. Go nine.

50:10.966 --> 50:13.134
<i>A yabba-dabba-doo time</i>

50:13.135 --> 50:16.104
<i>The Flintstones!</i>

50:24.438 --> 50:27.690
<i>We'll have a gay old</i>

50:27.691 --> 50:29.567
<i>Time</i>

50:29.568 --> 50:31.736
Oh!

50:31.737 --> 50:33.071
Yeah!

50:36.825 --> 50:40.620
Who said money doesn't buy happiness?

50:40.621 --> 50:44.624
But, Fred, isn't this
all too much too fast?

50:44.625 --> 50:48.086
Wilma, in the buffet of life
there are no second helpings.

50:48.087 --> 50:50.255
You gotta fill up your
plate, top off your cup,

50:50.256 --> 50:53.726
and stuff a few rolls in your pocket.

50:54.301 --> 50:56.427
Fred, stop!

50:56.428 --> 50:58.888
Mmm. Frisky!

51:01.642 --> 51:03.768
You know, Barney, life's funny.

51:03.769 --> 51:06.145
One minute people are
your best friends,

51:06.146 --> 51:07.981
the next you're fantasizing
they're being ripped apart

51:07.982 --> 51:10.155
by a pack of rabid wolves.

51:10.484 --> 51:13.328
- You too, huh?
- Oh, Barney, they've changed.

51:13.487 --> 51:16.030
I hardly know them since
Fred's become such a big shot.

51:16.031 --> 51:20.326
And it should be us squanderin' all our
money and treatin' our friends like dirt.

51:20.327 --> 51:24.502
- What do you mean?
- Oh, nothin'.

51:26.250 --> 51:28.293
Just sour grapes, I guess.

51:28.294 --> 51:30.336
Oh, don't worry, Barney.

51:30.337 --> 51:32.213
It's gonna get better.

51:32.214 --> 51:35.675
One day we're gonna look
back on all this and we'll laugh.

51:35.676 --> 51:37.176
Jeez, I hope so, Betty,

51:37.177 --> 51:39.512
'cause tomorrow they got
me testin' shark repellent.

51:39.513 --> 51:43.016
Mmm. Oh, Barney. Ooh.

51:46.937 --> 51:49.689
Leaving early?

51:49.690 --> 51:53.109
Actually, the wife and I were going to have
dinner tonight at Cavern on the Green.

51:53.110 --> 51:57.035
Ooh, pricey. Be sure to put
that on your expense account.

51:57.364 --> 51:59.699
Fred, before you go...

51:59.700 --> 52:02.285
Would you mind chipping your
"X" on a couple of these?

52:02.286 --> 52:03.828
Yeah, sure. What are they?

52:03.829 --> 52:06.456
Well, you sign these and your
buddies down in the quarry

52:06.457 --> 52:08.458
get some much-needed time off.

52:08.459 --> 52:13.463
No kiddin'! I guess Mr. Slate finally
noticed all those memos I been sendin' in.

52:13.464 --> 52:17.389
I hope the guys will know
who's to thank for this.

52:17.760 --> 52:20.094
I'll make sure you
get all the credit.

52:25.684 --> 52:29.354
Mr. Flintstone, up to
now our relationship

52:29.355 --> 52:32.231
has not been based on mutuality
of admiration or respect.

52:32.232 --> 52:33.358
Huh?

52:33.359 --> 52:36.736
Put simply, you hate my bird guts
and I think you're dumber than mud.

52:36.737 --> 52:41.032
- Ah. Well, good night.
- Still, I wish to pass on an old dictum...

52:41.033 --> 52:43.076
From business school that
may be apropos here.

52:43.077 --> 52:45.912
Only an idiot signs something
before reading it.

52:45.913 --> 52:50.166
Excuse me. I'm the executive,
you're the office equipment.

52:50.167 --> 52:53.044
If I want to ask the office
equipment for advice,

52:53.045 --> 52:55.718
I'll ask the water cooler!

52:55.756 --> 52:58.675
Ladies and gentlemen, the B.C.-52's!

53:02.054 --> 53:06.900
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey</i>

53:08.811 --> 53:11.646
<i>Twitch!</i>

53:11.647 --> 53:15.400
<i>Well, I know a place
where the hipsters go</i>

53:15.401 --> 53:18.611
<i>Called Bedrock
Twitch, twitch</i>

53:18.612 --> 53:22.281
<i>'Cause they're itching for

53:22.282 --> 53:25.827
<i>Bedrock

53:25.828 --> 53:28.663
<i>It's a funky town so
I'll see you down</i>

53:28.664 --> 53:31.833
<i>It's a funky town
called Bedrock, yeah</i>

53:31.834 --> 53:35.461
<i>Oh, the Stone Age crowd
is twitching proud</i>

53:35.462 --> 53:39.006
<i>In Bedrock
Twitch, twitch</i>

53:39.007 --> 53:43.603
<i>They do the twitch
Twitch, twitch, come on</i>

53:50.853 --> 53:53.196
<i>Twitch, twitch</i>

53:54.565 --> 53:57.318

53:57.985 --> 54:00.032

54:00.988 --> 54:04.708
<i>Twitch, twitch</i>

54:06.493 --> 54:09.370
<i>Do it, come on, baby
Do it, do it, do it</i>

54:09.371 --> 54:11.497
<i>Do the twitch like
you got an itch, itch</i>

54:11.498 --> 54:13.416
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

54:13.417 --> 54:14.876
<i>Itch, itch, itch, itch</i>

54:14.877 --> 54:16.669
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

54:16.670 --> 54:18.004
<i>Twitch!</i>

54:18.005 --> 54:20.465
Thank you, Bedrock!

54:20.466 --> 54:24.177
Thanks, everybody. And remember,
don't drink and pedal.

54:24.178 --> 54:26.180
Good night!

54:28.849 --> 54:30.433
How 'bout a spin, Betty?

54:30.434 --> 54:33.269
No, thank you, Fred.
I'll wait till Barney gets here.

54:33.270 --> 54:36.439
He started some new job today.
I'm not sure what time he gets done.

54:36.440 --> 54:38.858
While we're waiting, how about
another carafe of the bubbly?

54:38.859 --> 54:40.693
Garcon! Whoops.

54:40.694 --> 54:43.729
Don't worry, Mr. Flintstone.
I'll have that taken care of right away.

54:47.493 --> 54:50.041
Table seven, sonny.

54:56.043 --> 54:57.585
Barney!

54:57.586 --> 55:01.464
Barney, nice skins!
Sit down, take a load off!

55:01.465 --> 55:05.802
- I can't, Fred. I'm working here.
- You're a busboy?

55:05.803 --> 55:07.428
It's honest work.

55:07.429 --> 55:10.389
Yeah, I don't have to
fight Dino for my supper.

55:10.390 --> 55:15.020
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll get you a fresh tablecloth, sir.

55:17.564 --> 55:20.441
See Wilma, you were worried
he'd never find a job and

55:20.442 --> 55:22.151
we'd be stuck with him forever.

55:22.152 --> 55:24.905
Ow!

55:31.161 --> 55:34.705
<i>Flintstone! Flintstone!
We want Flintstone!</i>

55:34.706 --> 55:38.668
<i>The demonstration continues to
get uglier at Slate and Company</i>

55:38.669 --> 55:43.381
<i>following the unexpected layoff
of virtually the entire labor force</i>

55:43.382 --> 55:45.633
<i>by V.P. Fred Flintstone.</i>

55:45.634 --> 55:48.719
<i>For the Cave News Network,
this is Susan Rock.</i>

55:48.720 --> 55:51.013
Fred, did you hear what happened
to everyone at the quarry today?

55:51.014 --> 55:55.017
Yup. A few hours ago, I sent them
all off on a nice, long vacation.

55:55.018 --> 55:57.979
You mean, a permanent vacation.
He fired them!

55:57.980 --> 55:59.939
Fred! How could you?

55:59.940 --> 56:02.942
- I didn't do that.
- You did too! It's all over the TV!

56:02.943 --> 56:04.110
Fred!

56:04.111 --> 56:07.740
Who are you going to believe,
me or some busboy?

56:07.781 --> 56:10.533
That busboy is your best friend!

56:10.534 --> 56:14.620
Best friend? I lost my best friend
the day I became an executive!

56:14.621 --> 56:17.373
He's just jealous of my
hard-earned success.

56:17.374 --> 56:21.460
Hard-earned? Tell me something,
Mr. Vice President,

56:21.461 --> 56:24.171
what's a graduated
inventory plan, huh?

56:24.172 --> 56:26.674
How about supply and demand?

56:26.675 --> 56:29.803
Hey, Fred! What's two and two?

56:30.429 --> 56:33.139
I didn't come here to talk business.
I'm out with my wife.

56:33.140 --> 56:37.144
Now, get me a clean spoon.

56:37.811 --> 56:39.654
That does it!

56:39.730 --> 56:44.650
The only reason you got that job is
'cause I switched tests with you.

56:44.651 --> 56:48.738
- Oh, Barney.
- Oh-ho-ho, that's rich!

56:48.739 --> 56:53.826
What good would it do me to switch tests
with the guy that got the lowest score?

56:53.827 --> 56:59.040
- Think about it, Fred.
- Oh, finally it all makes sense.

56:59.041 --> 57:01.334
You don't believe this, do you?

57:01.335 --> 57:03.794
Are you calling my husband a liar?

57:03.795 --> 57:05.755
This has gone far enough.

57:05.756 --> 57:10.676
After everything that we've done
for you. We took you into our home.

57:10.677 --> 57:13.095
Yeah? So you could show
off every chance you got!

57:14.348 --> 57:16.724
You used to be such
nice people, but now...

57:16.725 --> 57:19.273
You're just a couple of rich snobs!

57:20.354 --> 57:23.314
Better than being a
couple of petty ingrates.

57:23.315 --> 57:27.035
Come on, Barney.
We are moving out, tonight!

57:27.444 --> 57:31.118
Hang on, Betty.
I forgot to punch out.

57:52.636 --> 57:54.788
Eh, put it up top.

57:55.389 --> 57:59.058
Betty, please. We can work it out.

57:59.059 --> 58:01.644
We're all civilized people here.

58:01.645 --> 58:04.271
It's too late, Wilma.

58:04.272 --> 58:08.442
Come on, we all said things
that we didn't mean.

58:08.443 --> 58:10.403
Speak for yourself.

58:10.404 --> 58:12.906
Come on, Betty. Time to hit the road.

58:12.990 --> 58:16.659
Fred! Aren't you even
the least bit sorry?

58:16.660 --> 58:20.329
Sure, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I
ever met the little moocher.

58:22.374 --> 58:24.333
Oh, Betty.

58:24.334 --> 58:27.132
- Good-bye, Wilma.
- Oh.

58:49.109 --> 58:51.782
They're gone.

58:55.574 --> 59:00.286
I cannot believe you just sat there
and let them walk out of our lives.

59:00.287 --> 59:02.955
At least I can walk around the
house in my underwear again.

59:02.956 --> 59:07.251
That's more important than
20 years of friendship?

59:07.252 --> 59:08.836
It is on a hot day.

59:09.837 --> 59:12.339
They were holding us back, Wilma.

59:12.340 --> 59:16.552
We'll make new friends. There's
4,000 other people in this world!

59:16.553 --> 59:19.977
- Who needs the Rubbles?
- I do.

59:20.182 --> 59:22.933
But I'll tell you what I don't need.

59:22.934 --> 59:26.233
I don't need this necklace.

59:27.564 --> 59:31.108
You know, I don't need this lamp.

59:31.109 --> 59:35.321
And I don't need this television set.

59:35.322 --> 59:36.914
Not the TV!

59:38.033 --> 59:40.126
I don't need this.

59:41.328 --> 59:43.537
I don't need this.

59:43.538 --> 59:46.457
I don't think I'll be needing
any of this bone china.

59:47.918 --> 59:51.504
Because I don't have any
friends to invite to dinner.

59:51.505 --> 59:55.925
I don't think I'll be using
any of these cups or saucers.

59:55.926 --> 59:58.594
You're gonna regret this, Wilma.

59:58.595 --> 01:00:01.555
It's gonna take you hours
to clean up this mess.

01:00:10.232 --> 01:00:13.192
All right, Wilma.
Enough of this charade.

01:00:13.193 --> 01:00:16.862
Come back now, and I'll forgive ya.

01:00:16.863 --> 01:00:19.698
Oh, you're bluff in',
Wilma Slaghoople.

01:00:19.699 --> 01:00:22.493
You're not going to your mother's.

01:00:22.494 --> 01:00:24.370
Once around the block, you'll realize

01:00:24.371 --> 01:00:28.375
the folly of your ways and
you'll come crawling back.

01:00:32.045 --> 01:00:33.967
Please.

01:01:01.408 --> 01:01:05.536
It's finally happened,
I've become my father.

01:01:05.537 --> 01:01:07.872
Now, Barney, don't talk like that.

01:01:07.873 --> 01:01:11.041
- This place is fine for now.
- Come on, Betty.

01:01:11.042 --> 01:01:14.086
We're living downwind from
a family of wild boars.

01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:18.137
- Face it. We've hit rock bottom.
- Hmm.

01:01:19.801 --> 01:01:21.928
Come here, little guy.

01:01:22.971 --> 01:01:26.348
Can you say da-da? Say da-da.

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:29.143
- Bamm-Bamm!
- Oh.

01:01:29.144 --> 01:01:32.771
It doesn't really matter where we
live, as long as we're together.

01:01:32.772 --> 01:01:34.819
Family hug!

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:45.451
- Betty?
- Hmm?

01:01:45.452 --> 01:01:49.332
Exactly where did you get those eggs?

01:01:53.418 --> 01:01:55.170
Sorry.

01:01:55.629 --> 01:01:58.464
I think it might be twins.

01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:05.187
There he is!

01:02:09.684 --> 01:02:11.852
You're a traitor, Flintstone!

01:02:11.853 --> 01:02:14.980
- Listen to me. I'm your friend.
- You're no friend of ours!

01:02:14.981 --> 01:02:18.405
You're a rotten bowler too!

01:02:29.704 --> 01:02:32.457
Good morning, Mr. Flint...

01:02:43.802 --> 01:02:45.261
They made a fool of me.

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:47.888
Look what they had to work with.

01:02:50.642 --> 01:02:53.352
Flintstone, heard you were
down in the file room.

01:02:53.353 --> 01:02:55.271
Find anything interesting?

01:02:55.272 --> 01:02:57.690
Yeah! I'm on to your little scam.

01:02:57.691 --> 01:03:00.567
Billing phony companies and
keeping the money for yourself.

01:03:00.568 --> 01:03:03.529
- I'm going to Mr. Slate.
- Good idea.

01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:06.532
Turning yourself in might
buy you a little leniency.

01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:10.327
- Me? This entire scheme was your idea.
- True.

01:03:10.328 --> 01:03:13.080
But I've graciously decided
to give you all the credit,

01:03:13.081 --> 01:03:15.541
since it's your name
on the requisitions.

01:03:15.542 --> 01:03:17.293
I never touched any of that money!

01:03:17.294 --> 01:03:19.795
Hmm. Fred, please.

01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:24.675
Remodeling your house, furs, jewelry,
a fully-equipped Le Sabertooth.

01:03:24.676 --> 01:03:27.520
Tsk, tsk, tsk. You should
have been more discreet.

01:03:27.554 --> 01:03:28.804
I'm innocent!

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:32.224
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo.
Miss Stone, call security.

01:03:32.225 --> 01:03:34.727
Tell them we've
uncovered an embezzler.

01:03:34.728 --> 01:03:38.152
Miss Stone,
you'll back me up, won't ya?

01:03:39.316 --> 01:03:42.239
You better run while you
still have a chance.

01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:47.281
You'll never get away with this.

01:03:47.282 --> 01:03:49.534
I already have.

01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:07.268
Here comes the pterodactyl.

01:04:08.553 --> 01:04:12.431
- Mmm-mmm-mmm.
- It's no use, Mother.

01:04:12.432 --> 01:04:14.767
She misses Fred.

01:04:15.768 --> 01:04:19.313
I hope it's not that
pesky Avrok lady again.

01:04:19.314 --> 01:04:21.942
Oh!

01:04:22.275 --> 01:04:24.193
- Betty!
- Oh.

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:27.446
- Bamm-Bamm!
- I have missed you so much.

01:04:27.447 --> 01:04:32.326
I don't care what Barney said.
I couldn't let you go through this alone.

01:04:32.327 --> 01:04:35.671
- Have you heard from Fred?
- No.

01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:41.173
I spoke to a lawyer.

01:04:41.336 --> 01:04:44.963
If he's missing seven years,
you can remarry.

01:04:44.964 --> 01:04:47.508
Mother!

01:04:47.509 --> 01:04:52.805
Well, wherever Fred is,
I hope he knows I still love him.

01:04:52.806 --> 01:04:54.681
Oh.

01:04:54.682 --> 01:04:59.653
<i>Calling all Bedrock units,
all Bedrock units.</i>

01:05:09.489 --> 01:05:12.408
<i>Tonight, in a special edition
of Bedrock's Most Wanted,</i>

01:05:12.409 --> 01:05:15.494
<i>we bring you the story
that's rocked our city,</i>

01:05:15.495 --> 01:05:19.215
<i>"The Case of the
Embezzling Executive."</i>

01:05:22.168 --> 01:05:25.379
<i>Mr. Flintstone, what are you doing?</i>

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:29.054
<i>I'm an executive. I'm embezzling.</i>

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:30.551
<i>I'm shocked!</i>

01:05:30.552 --> 01:05:33.929
How could you ever marry that man?

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:37.474
Mother! That man is not my husband.

01:05:37.475 --> 01:05:41.145
That's right. He plays Dr. Gravelman
on <i>The Young And The Thumbless.</i>

01:05:41.146 --> 01:05:44.731
Fred might be a lot of things
but a thief is not one of them.

01:05:44.732 --> 01:05:47.484
- Can he prove it?
<i>- Who cares?</i>

01:05:47.485 --> 01:05:51.029
<i>Yabba-dabba-dabba!</i>

01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:52.614
<i>This menace remains at large...</i>

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:54.032
<i>We ask the public's
help in apprehending...</i>

01:05:54.033 --> 01:05:56.160
Maybe I can.

01:06:14.345 --> 01:06:18.223
A little something to take that
chill off. Take a swig of this.

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:21.193
Put hair on your knuckles.

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:26.775
Tell me something... You one of those guys
that was laid off at the stone quarry?

01:06:26.858 --> 01:06:28.317
I used to work there.

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:31.403
A lot of guys here would
like to get their hands

01:06:31.404 --> 01:06:33.780
on the guy who's
responsible for all this.

01:06:33.781 --> 01:06:38.243
- So they could hear his side of the story?
- What? His side of the story?

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:46.168
Huh? Flintstone!

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:48.420
Flintstone!

01:06:51.716 --> 01:06:54.676
It is! Flintstone!

01:06:58.973 --> 01:07:00.690
Squealer!

01:07:01.226 --> 01:07:02.978
Get him!

01:07:08.066 --> 01:07:09.274
Just think.

01:07:09.275 --> 01:07:14.281
This time tomorrow, we'll be
on a pterodactyl winging our...

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:16.949
- Oh, Cliff.
- Hmm?

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:20.044
How come there's only
one ticket to Rocapulco?

01:07:22.497 --> 01:07:27.125
For your protection, darling. I thought
I would go on a "business trip,"

01:07:27.126 --> 01:07:29.002
while you stay here to
keep up appearances.

01:07:29.003 --> 01:07:33.053
Then, when we're sure
it's safe, I'll send for you.

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:36.144
Forgive me, Cliff.

01:07:37.345 --> 01:07:39.973
Looks like you've
thought of everything.

01:07:53.818 --> 01:07:56.664
Psst. Excuse me!

01:07:57.824 --> 01:08:01.660
- Hello.
- No, Mumsie, I don't want to go to school.

01:08:01.661 --> 01:08:04.496
The other boys make fun of me.

01:08:04.497 --> 01:08:06.665
Wake up!

01:08:06.666 --> 01:08:11.837
Oh, Mrs. Flintstone. To what do
I owe the honor of this break-in?

01:08:11.838 --> 01:08:14.298
I need your help, Mr. Bird.

01:08:14.299 --> 01:08:16.675
You hear everything that
goes on in this office.

01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:17.926
Hmm-hmm.

01:08:17.926 --> 01:08:20.929
You are the only one who
can help clear my husband.

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:25.183
What a delicious irony.
Thank you for sharing it with me.

01:08:25.184 --> 01:08:29.029
Now, let me share something with you.

01:08:30.732 --> 01:08:33.524
Oh, now, Wilma, calm down.

01:08:33.526 --> 01:08:37.904
- Maybe I can reason with him.
- Ow!

01:08:37.904 --> 01:08:40.828
There. All set.

01:08:41.408 --> 01:08:45.162
You know, my only regret
is I won't be around

01:08:45.162 --> 01:08:50.334
when that shoddy new equipment
blows up in their big, dumb faces.

01:08:50.335 --> 01:08:55.432
Oh, well, I'll just have to console
myself with all that money.

01:08:57.049 --> 01:09:00.645
Hey, who's that?

01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:06.559
That's Flintstone's wife.

01:09:06.768 --> 01:09:09.895
What would she want
with a stinky old dict...

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:12.731
Son of a brachiosaurus!

01:09:12.732 --> 01:09:17.908
Well, Cliff. I guess you
haven't thought of everything.

01:09:18.363 --> 01:09:21.448
Oh, this is far from over.

01:09:29.122 --> 01:09:31.249
String him up!

01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:33.502
You can't do this. I was framed!

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:38.008
In a minute you're going to be boxed.

01:09:41.424 --> 01:09:43.678
Anybody want a snow cone?

01:09:44.096 --> 01:09:46.395
- Barney!
- Fred!

01:09:46.974 --> 01:09:49.225
- What are you doing here?
- I'm getting lynched!

01:09:49.227 --> 01:09:53.479
Oh. I got cherry, lime, rocky road.

01:09:53.481 --> 01:09:55.904
Do you know this guy?

01:09:56.275 --> 01:09:59.449
Know him? He used
to be my best friend.

01:09:59.529 --> 01:10:01.446
In a way, if it wasn't for me,

01:10:01.447 --> 01:10:03.782
this whole mess probably
wouldn't have happened.

01:10:03.783 --> 01:10:09.121
Thanks for filling us in. We could've
made a very big mistake here.

01:10:09.122 --> 01:10:11.248
- Hang both of 'em.
- What?

01:10:11.249 --> 01:10:14.878
Gee, take it easy. They make
you pay for your own uniforms.

01:10:16.379 --> 01:10:19.631
Barney, I thought you
came to save me.

01:10:19.632 --> 01:10:23.969
Save you? I saw a crowd,
I figured I'd sell a few snow cones.

01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:27.055
- You mean you haven't forgiven me yet?
- Nope.

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:29.182
And frankly, I don't think
this is going to help.

01:10:29.183 --> 01:10:32.018
- I took a cherry.
- I can't break a 20.

01:10:32.019 --> 01:10:35.021
Hey, hey, hey! Wait a minute!

01:10:35.022 --> 01:10:39.192
Look, Barn, I know you're
still a little mad at me.

01:10:39.193 --> 01:10:43.864
But I want you to know, if I had to
have someone hanging next to me,

01:10:43.865 --> 01:10:47.164
I'm glad it's you.

01:10:48.453 --> 01:10:52.330
I guess switchin' them tests didn't turn
out much like I planned, huh, Fred?

01:10:52.331 --> 01:10:54.499
Hey, got any lemon?

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.501
Check in the back.

01:10:56.502 --> 01:11:00.213
Gee, why can't business
be this good every day?

01:11:00.214 --> 01:11:02.883
The story of my life.

01:11:02.884 --> 01:11:05.927
- I'm a loser.
- No, you're not.

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:07.679
This makes me a winner?

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:09.890
No, but you're the best
friend a guy ever had

01:11:09.891 --> 01:11:13.101
and that makes you a
winner in my book, pal.

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:14.774
Me...

01:11:15.688 --> 01:11:17.735
I'm just a big jerk.

01:11:18.983 --> 01:11:21.651
Ah, everybody loves you, Fred.

01:11:21.652 --> 01:11:24.029
Except for this lynch mob.

01:11:24.906 --> 01:11:26.239
Ah, Barn.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.117
Ah, Fred.

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:35.499
You'll have plenty of time
to bond in the afterlife.

01:11:39.795 --> 01:11:42.255
Wilma, look!

01:11:45.759 --> 01:11:48.729
Watch out for that tree!

01:11:53.383 --> 01:11:56.107
Now wait, everybody.

01:11:57.396 --> 01:11:59.773
Fred is innocent.

01:12:00.733 --> 01:12:03.902
Barney, do you have to
do everything Fred does?

01:12:03.903 --> 01:12:07.280
Everybody, listen to him.

01:12:07.281 --> 01:12:12.207
First things first.
I demand an apology.

01:12:12.245 --> 01:12:16.164
- I'm sorry!
- Not you, him.

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:19.626
Me? Apologize to a bird?

01:12:19.627 --> 01:12:22.462
Not Fred Flintstone!

01:12:22.463 --> 01:12:24.256
I had hoped we might be
colleagues but instead,

01:12:24.257 --> 01:12:28.011
you've treated me as if I were an
ordinary piece of office furniture.

01:12:28.052 --> 01:12:30.929
I may eat bugs, but I have
feelings, Mr. Flintstone.

01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:33.223
And you've hurt them.

01:12:33.224 --> 01:12:35.101
Aww.

01:12:36.602 --> 01:12:41.606
Uh, well, look, I know I could've
been a little more sensitive.

01:12:41.607 --> 01:12:44.568
- Especially when you were molting.
- Oh.

01:12:44.569 --> 01:12:46.903
So, I'm... Sorry.

01:12:46.904 --> 01:12:50.328
I don't think they
heard you in the back.

01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:53.785
- I'm sorry.
- Pardon?

01:12:53.786 --> 01:12:57.122
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
- Oh.

01:12:58.332 --> 01:13:01.042
Now, then, gather 'round, everyone.

01:13:01.043 --> 01:13:04.504
I'll tell you the tale of
an unsophisticated man

01:13:04.505 --> 01:13:07.299
caught up in a treacherous
web of power,

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:09.802
deceit and lust.

01:13:09.969 --> 01:13:12.312
Ooh, yeah.

01:13:13.681 --> 01:13:16.309
Why is the door open?

01:13:18.436 --> 01:13:21.860
- Betty, the door is open!
- Wilma, something's wrong!

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:30.448
- Pebbles!
- Bamm-Bamm!

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:36.328
What kind of madman would
do something like this?

01:13:40.574 --> 01:13:42.785
That's a poor poochie.

01:13:43.169 --> 01:13:45.763
That's a baby.

01:13:52.762 --> 01:13:56.431
- Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm are gone!
- They left this.

01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:59.100
- It's a note.
- If you want to see your kids again,

01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:01.937
bring the Dictabird to the
quarry at dawn. No police.

01:14:18.579 --> 01:14:20.664
Mr. Flintstone.

01:14:20.665 --> 01:14:24.668
Stealing office equipment,
really. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

01:14:24.669 --> 01:14:28.129
Is this the kind of example you
want to set for your daughter?

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:31.132
- Where are the kids?
- The bird, please.

01:14:32.885 --> 01:14:36.013
- First, we want our children.
- Of course.

01:14:39.264 --> 01:14:41.059
Bamm-Bamm!

01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:42.811
Take one more step, Mr. Rubble,

01:14:42.812 --> 01:14:46.356
and this quarry's safety record
will be severely tarnished.

01:14:46.357 --> 01:14:48.325
Now, give me the bird.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:52.237
Go on, Fred. Give him what he wants.

01:14:52.238 --> 01:14:55.115
- What?
- Don't worry, I got a plan.

01:14:55.116 --> 01:14:57.742
We're gonna get the kids back
and then we'll rescue you.

01:14:57.743 --> 01:14:59.711
What a strategist.

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:04.124
I should have signed with Disney.

01:15:04.125 --> 01:15:07.595
They never would've allowed
this sort of thing to happen.

01:15:11.465 --> 01:15:14.138
- Ahh! Thank you, gentlemen.
- Easy.

01:15:14.802 --> 01:15:17.137
And in the words of
my beloved mother,

01:15:17.138 --> 01:15:21.609
I'm taking the money and
moving to a warmer climate.

01:15:29.108 --> 01:15:31.110
Help, Daddy!

01:15:37.491 --> 01:15:40.618
Let's discuss this, Cliff.
May I call you Cliff?

01:15:40.619 --> 01:15:43.622
Barney, too much pressure.

01:15:51.338 --> 01:15:54.674
One, two, three...

01:15:57.094 --> 01:15:58.720
Nice goin'.

01:15:58.721 --> 01:16:01.815
- Now what do we do?
- You get the kids, I'll try and stop this.

01:16:26.248 --> 01:16:28.500
Whoa!

01:16:37.718 --> 01:16:41.012
Cliff y, have I ever told you you
have a very distinguished chin?

01:16:41.013 --> 01:16:43.936
Shut up! Ahh!

01:16:48.521 --> 01:16:50.113
Whoa!

01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:54.634
Yo, ow, ow, ow, ow!

01:16:57.655 --> 01:17:00.073
Oh, dear, Oh, dear.

01:17:00.074 --> 01:17:03.373
Too many years behind
a desk. Mayday, mayday!

01:17:08.958 --> 01:17:11.677
Hi, da-da.

01:17:12.044 --> 01:17:14.888
You did it! You called me da-da!

01:17:16.548 --> 01:17:19.143
Oh, Barney, you lunkhead!

01:17:31.147 --> 01:17:35.191
What am I going to do?
I gotta think of somethin'.

01:17:38.821 --> 01:17:40.664
Not now.

01:17:48.581 --> 01:17:50.583
Wake up, Uncle Barney!

01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:55.670
Help, help!

01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:59.516
Save me! Save me
from this mad M.B.A.!

01:17:59.967 --> 01:18:04.267
- Don't worry. I'll take care of him.
- My hero.

01:18:06.599 --> 01:18:08.271
Yipes.

01:18:08.309 --> 01:18:12.313
Flintstone, kiss your bird good-bye.

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:16.442
Oh, mama.

01:18:22.281 --> 01:18:24.532
Will there be anything
else, Mr. Flintstone?

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:27.661
No, Miss Stone.
Take the rest of the day off.

01:19:01.612 --> 01:19:05.161
Yabba-dabba-doo!

01:19:09.954 --> 01:19:11.871
Cliff?

01:19:11.872 --> 01:19:14.841
It's time for you and
me to interface.

01:19:31.016 --> 01:19:34.486
- Aah!
- Stee-rike!

01:19:55.541 --> 01:19:57.166
And then, Cliff said,

01:19:57.167 --> 01:20:00.712
"True. But I've graciously decided
to give you all the credit,

01:20:00.713 --> 01:20:04.387
"since it's your name on all
the requisition forms."

01:20:07.219 --> 01:20:10.680
Mr. Flintstone, I may
not be in on Monday.

01:20:10.681 --> 01:20:13.016
Don't worry, Miss Stone.
I'll tell 'em what you did.

01:20:13.017 --> 01:20:16.396
- They'll let you off easy.
- I've been a very bad girl.

01:20:17.021 --> 01:20:19.147
But you have to admit,

01:20:19.148 --> 01:20:23.198
I was very, very good at it.

01:20:26.905 --> 01:20:29.407
Come on, do it for Mommy. Who am I?

01:20:29.408 --> 01:20:32.252
- Bamm-Bamm!
- Oh.

01:20:35.039 --> 01:20:37.332
Thank goodness, you're all right.

01:20:37.333 --> 01:20:41.419
Well, I'm not going to jail, but it
won't be easy getting a new job.

01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:43.129
What kind of reference is
Mr. Slate gonna give me

01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:44.589
after I destroyed his quarry?

01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:48.468
None of this was your fault.
Mr. Slate will understand.

01:20:48.469 --> 01:20:51.637
Flintstone!

01:20:51.638 --> 01:20:53.931
Sure, now he gets my name right.

01:20:53.932 --> 01:20:56.025
How did this happen?

01:20:56.894 --> 01:21:00.855
Mr. Slate, it all started when the
Rubbles here wanted to adopt a baby.

01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:03.191
Not that!

01:21:03.192 --> 01:21:06.115
How did this happen to Cliff?

01:21:07.321 --> 01:21:09.489
Well, you see, Mr. Slate,

01:21:09.490 --> 01:21:12.241
the machinery went haywire and
the rocks got all crushed up

01:21:12.242 --> 01:21:14.577
and that got mixed in with water
and that came all down the hill.

01:21:14.578 --> 01:21:17.297
- Mr. Slate, I'm sorry!
- Sorry?

01:21:17.915 --> 01:21:20.208
I love this stuff!

01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:23.462
I'm gonna name it after
my daughter Concretia.

01:21:24.129 --> 01:21:27.223
Flintstone, you're a genius!

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:31.386
Me? Really? Why?

01:21:31.387 --> 01:21:36.641
Don't you see? Thanks to concrete,
man can now shape his own destiny.

01:21:36.642 --> 01:21:38.726
- The Stone Age is over!
- Ahh.

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:42.605
First thing, I want you to hire
back all the men, Flintstone.

01:21:42.606 --> 01:21:44.982
- We're going into production immediately.
- We?

01:21:44.983 --> 01:21:46.150
That's right.

01:21:46.151 --> 01:21:50.029
You are hereby promoted to President
of the entire concrete division.

01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:52.328
Yabba...

01:21:57.913 --> 01:21:59.497
That's a real nice offer, Mr. Slate,

01:21:59.498 --> 01:22:02.291
but unfortunately, I'm gonna
have to turn you down.

01:22:02.292 --> 01:22:04.043
Don't listen to him, Mr. Slate.

01:22:04.044 --> 01:22:07.004
Fred, it's a great job!
This time, you deserve it.

01:22:07.005 --> 01:22:09.757
Barney, all my life I
wanted to be a somebody.

01:22:09.758 --> 01:22:13.307
And when I finally did, I turned
into somebody I didn't like.

01:22:13.512 --> 01:22:16.180
Good grief, man,
have you lost your mind?

01:22:16.181 --> 01:22:19.517
This could make you rich
beyond your wildest dreams.

01:22:19.518 --> 01:22:22.520
I was always the richest
man in the world.

01:22:22.521 --> 01:22:24.694
I just never knew it.

01:22:25.357 --> 01:22:27.191
So, if it's okay with you, Mr. Slate,

01:22:27.192 --> 01:22:30.286
all I want is my old job
back and my old life.

01:22:30.654 --> 01:22:32.997
Fred.

01:22:33.949 --> 01:22:36.576
And two weeks paid vacation
for all the men in the quarry,

01:22:36.577 --> 01:22:38.453
an annual cost of livin' increase

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:41.707
and those little packets of
ketchup in the lunchroom.

01:22:41.708 --> 01:22:43.416
Done!

01:22:43.417 --> 01:22:46.511
Thanks, boss. See you
at the company picnic.

01:22:47.379 --> 01:22:50.678
There goes the best
executive I ever had.

01:22:51.467 --> 01:22:54.969
- Fred, I'm so proud of you.
- And I'm proud of you, Barney.

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:56.387
- I'm starving!
- Me too!

01:22:56.388 --> 01:23:00.016
What do you say we get some breakfast.
Snake and eggs for everybody.

01:23:00.017 --> 01:23:01.392
- My treat.
- Great.

01:23:01.393 --> 01:23:02.894
Barney...

01:23:03.854 --> 01:23:07.654
- Yeah, Fred?
- Spot me a couple bucks? I'm a little short.

01:23:08.901 --> 01:23:11.244
- Not this time!
- What?

01:23:30.422 --> 01:23:32.882
