Now, have you had a trip or a fall at
work that wasn't your fault?

11:07.345 --> 11:09.384
Or have you been mis-sold PPI?

11:09.385 --> 11:13.344
If the answer to either question is
yes, you probably need cheering up!

11:13.345 --> 11:14.944
Why not try the BGT app?

11:14.945 --> 11:17.504
It's got five free votes,

You can download it on your smart

11:23.505 --> 11:26.184
While you do that, we'll take a very
quick break.

11:26.185 --> 11:29.664
We'll be right back with dinky
dance duo Lexie &amp; Christopher!

Welcome back to the last live
semi-final of Britain's Got Talent.

11:43.695 --> 11:48.374
Now, our next act is two dancing
schoolchildren, Lexie and
Christopher.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.414
And, after seeing their audition,

11:50.415 --> 11:53.494
some people said Lexie was
very bossy - but not me.

11:53.495 --> 11:55.734
I'm way too scared of her
to say that!

11:55.735 --> 11:58.054
It's Lexie &amp; Christopher!

a long term career.

I think the minute you walked out
here, Micky, I said to Amanda,

"This guy has won over the audience
before he's even started."

25:52.636 --> 25:55.555

Micky,

25:55.556 --> 25:57.675

for a long time,

so smart, so quick, so funny

I didn't think this was gonna happen.

32:48.996 --> 32:51.955
<font color="yellow">I just think we need more females in</font>
<font color="yellow">this final</font>

32:51.956 --> 32:56.315

<font color="yellow">because I think you're brilliant.</font>

<font color="yellow">I love you. I think you're crazy.</font>

32:59.676 --> 33:03.635

<font color="yellow">through to the next round,</font>

33:03.636 --> 33:06.475
<font color="yellow">but I'd totally come out with you</font>
<font color="yellow">on a night out.</font>

33:06.476 --> 33:10.075
(BOOING) <font color="yellow">Weren't we? We were both</font>
<font color="yellow">saying, "She's a lot of fun."</font>

33:10.076 --> 33:14.035
<font color="yellow">It's a lot of fun.</font>
<font color="yellow">There's nothing catty about that.</font>

33:14.036 --> 33:16.675
Thank you very much, judges. To see
Sarah in the final

33:16.676 --> 33:19.555

we've got belting boy band,
Bring It North

33:38.436 --> 33:41.675

Welcome back to the last semi-final

33:55.295 --> 33:57.614
I just came up here for
a few high fives.

33:57.615 --> 34:02.214
The next act are a little boy band

34:41.215 --> 34:43.295

<font color="yellow">can't wait. We're super excited.</font>

34:51.975 --> 34:55.014
I'm gonna take a little bit of a
risk here. You've got a fourth yes.

34:57.815 --> 35:01.054
<font color="yellow">We've had jam-packed rehearsals</font>

(WILD CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

39:12.735 --> 39:16.054
Guys, for me, this was a whole
different proposition

39:16.055 --> 39:19.174
from what I first saw. You were...

39:19.175 --> 39:21.974
You probably have a manager
and he was probably telling you

39:21.975 --> 39:24.614
to do the boy band talk and blah,
blah, blah.

39:24.615 --> 39:30.094
I didn't feel that a 12/13 year old
boy band group would work.

39:30.095 --> 39:33.774
This song was absolutely age
appropriate.

39:33.775 --> 39:38.815
It was perfect for you
and it demonstrated who you are.

39:41.055 --> 39:44.934
You're not ready yet for a recording
contract.

39:44.935 --> 39:48.014
You're not ready yet and I wouldn't
even put you through that.

39:48.015 --> 39:52.614
What this is is preparation for
where you could be.

39:52.615 --> 39:56.054
{\an1}Cos let me tell you something, these
five guys, off the back of this,

39:56.055 --> 40:01.574
could end up in a big show in the
West End which is perfect for you.

40:01.575 --> 40:05.334
Then you get experience and then,
when you're ready,

40:05.335 --> 40:08.174
then when you're the right age,
if you stick together,

40:08.175 --> 40:10.454
you've had the best training
in the world.

40:10.455 --> 40:13.334
This is not about the immediate
moment.

40:13.335 --> 40:16.214
This is about a moment in time where
you have created something

40:16.215 --> 40:20.374
where we're gonna talk about you and
it's gonna go up from here.

40:20.375 --> 40:24.014
So you made a million percent the
right decision.

40:24.015 --> 40:26.334
I was really impressed with that.
<font color="#11FF11">Thank you.</font>

40:26.335 --> 40:30.494
Thank you, judges. Great comments.
Well done.

40:30.495 --> 40:33.534
Good work. If Bring It North are
your favourites,

40:33.535 --> 40:36.854
you can get behind them by following
the details on screen.

40:36.855 --> 40:39.374
But not yet. You can't vote till
we've seen the last act.

Next up tonight is a comedy magician
whose performance

40:54.215 --> 40:56.734
at the auditions just about had it
all -

40:56.735 --> 41:00.734
intrigue, mystique, a shovel
and a water melon!

41:00.735 --> 41:02.895
It's Mandy Muden.

<font color="#11FF11">magic when I was 10 years old.</font>

41:13.815 --> 41:16.015
<font color="#11FF11">Because I used to make things</font>

<font color="#11FF11">..from a local shop.</font>

41:19.255 --> 41:22.814
<font color="#11FF11">And the great thing about being</font>
<font color="#11FF11">a magician is the audience reaction.</font>

41:22.815 --> 41:27.054
<font color="#11FF11">Because they absolutely love it</font>
<font color="#11FF11">when you get things right.</font>

41:27.055 --> 41:29.574
<font color="#11FF11">Oops, a bit of spillage there.</font>

41:44.255 --> 41:46.694
<font color="#11FF11">I got, actually, emotional at the</font>
<font color="#11FF11">first audition.</font>

41:46.695 --> 41:49.174
<font color="#11FF11">It's because I've been doing this</font>
<font color="#11FF11">for so long</font>

41:49.175 --> 41:51.814
<font color="#11FF11">and the judges' comments meant a</font>

41:51.815 --> 41:54.454

Because you've entered the show
for a reason.

48:33.535 --> 48:36.654
What would be your dream if you were
to make it to the final

48:36.655 --> 48:39.054
and actually win this competition?

48:39.055 --> 48:41.055
I'm really curious now.

I think you're very unique.
Actually, you know what?

You were better than the first time.
Part of the reason is

49:09.495 --> 49:14.574
I think you're so likeable, and kind
of like, it's old school...

because the Almighty Himself

50:25.485 --> 50:26.724
spoke to him directly.

His exact words were, "Ray, I didn't
like it - I LOVED it.

<font color="cyan">lifted the song on the second part,</font>

55:58.529 --> 56:03.048

Welcome back to Britain's Got Talent.

58:16.051 --> 58:19.444
Now our last act tonight are two
siblings

58:19.446 --> 58:20.925
who walk up and down the stairs

58:20.926 --> 58:23.085
with one of them balanced on the
other's head.

58:23.086 --> 58:26.125
I still think they should have called
the act Step Brothers.

58:26.126 --> 58:29.485
(LAUGHTER) But would they listen?
No, they would not. Didn't listen.

58:29.486 --> 58:31.605
I have to say don't try this at home

58:31.606 --> 58:36.005
in case you were thinking of popping
upstairs with any family members
balanced on your head.

58:36.006 --> 58:37.685
Please don't do that.
