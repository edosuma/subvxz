WEBVTT

00:00.334 --> 00:01.793
RAELLE: Previously
on Motherland.

00:01.793 --> 00:03.837
Mom?

00:03.837 --> 00:05.756
HEARST: Why don't you just let
me dynamite this?

00:05.756 --> 00:07.299
MAN: I need something
that's gonna spread.

00:07.299 --> 00:08.842
Meet your personal oversight,
Colonel Jarrett.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.761
IZADORA: Penelope, dear?

00:10.761 --> 00:12.429
-WOMAN: So she's human?
-IZADORA: Essentially.

00:12.429 --> 00:14.389
You cannot tell anybody
that you saw me here.

00:14.389 --> 00:15.724
Not even the Council.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.559
We've come to a decision.

00:17.559 --> 00:19.102
You'll be allowed
to leave the Cession,

00:19.102 --> 00:22.231
but none of you
can return here ever.

00:22.231 --> 00:23.732
HEARST: By the blast of God
they perish.

00:23.732 --> 00:25.025
WOMAN: Thelma!

00:25.025 --> 00:27.152
-(screams)
-(Hearst grunts)

00:27.152 --> 00:30.113
Surrender now and I'll let
Raelle's daddy live.

00:30.113 --> 00:31.573
-Edwin!
-Kill them all!

00:31.573 --> 00:32.658
SCYLLA: Stop!

00:32.658 --> 00:34.743
(groans)

00:36.078 --> 00:37.371
It's not possible.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.956
It's getting worse.

00:38.956 --> 00:40.499
So what does that mean
for Raelle?

00:40.499 --> 00:42.084
MAN: Ready, turn.

00:43.669 --> 00:46.004
Atten-hut!

00:46.004 --> 00:47.714
WOMAN: Goddess!

00:51.718 --> 00:53.679
REPORTER: The President kicked
off the World Economic Forum

00:53.679 --> 00:56.014
here in New York this morning
with opening remarks

00:56.014 --> 00:58.183
that were by all accounts,
very well received.

00:58.183 --> 01:00.602
And now, accompanied,
as he usually is these days,

01:00.602 --> 01:02.521
by his friend
and advisor Kara Brandt

01:02.521 --> 01:04.731
he will spend the rest
of the day in breakout sessions

01:04.731 --> 01:07.109
with other world leaders
discussing matters

01:07.109 --> 01:08.735
that will affect the course
of the global economy

01:08.735 --> 01:10.112
for years to come.

01:10.112 --> 01:11.530
DELAGATE:
Ms. Brandt tells us

01:11.530 --> 01:13.198
your Genealogical
Registration Program

01:13.198 --> 01:15.284
is a success, Mr. President.

01:15.284 --> 01:17.327
So nice to be able to find
these lost witches

01:17.327 --> 01:19.997
and help keep them safe.

01:19.997 --> 01:21.665
Yes. The test launch
in Northern California

01:21.665 --> 01:23.709
has been very encouraging,
Prime Minister.

01:23.709 --> 01:26.044
No pushback on the collars?

01:26.044 --> 01:27.546
Surprisingly not as much
as you'd think.

01:27.546 --> 01:29.214
Making the collars removable

01:29.214 --> 01:31.008
gives them a perceived sense
of freedom,

01:31.008 --> 01:32.843
a kind of, uh,
"meeting halfway" gesture.

01:32.843 --> 01:34.261
When do you plan to escalate?

01:34.261 --> 01:36.054
Soon.

01:36.054 --> 01:38.140
You always place a frog
in cold water

01:38.140 --> 01:40.058
before you bring it to a boil.

01:40.058 --> 01:42.102
By the time they realize
what's happening,

01:42.102 --> 01:43.186
it's too late.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.439
Well then, we have a model

01:45.439 --> 01:47.441
we can follow
in our own countries.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.153
(siren blaring)

01:51.153 --> 01:52.029
(whispers) Ma'am...

01:53.905 --> 01:55.032
Send him in.

01:56.658 --> 01:59.161
I apologize
for the interruption.

01:59.161 --> 02:00.996
Oh, dear.

02:00.996 --> 02:02.247
Girl trouble, Alban?

02:04.041 --> 02:05.042
It's worse than that.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.170
The Witchbomb is dead,

02:08.170 --> 02:10.339
but somehow Alder has returned.

02:13.634 --> 02:14.843
And she's changed.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.013
She's stronger.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.018
Tell us what happened.

02:24.603 --> 02:25.687
I had them in hand,

02:27.147 --> 02:29.149
until one of the Cession leaders
interfered.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.400
-And then Alder...
-Stop.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.568
Stop.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.113
Why didn't you lead
with the good news?

02:37.866 --> 02:39.409
The Cession Council

02:39.409 --> 02:41.244
had the fugitives
and didn't extradite,

02:41.244 --> 02:42.663
a clear violation of the treaty.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.289
Which paves the way
for our invasion.

02:44.289 --> 02:45.624
But we need congressional
approval.

02:45.624 --> 02:47.250
Don't worry. We have the votes.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.503
These fugitives have proven
quite useful.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.254
They helped turn the tide of
public opinion

02:51.254 --> 02:52.923
against the witches,
and now we can use them

02:52.923 --> 02:55.258
as an excuse
to go into the Cession.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.177
A place where witches
and the general populace

02:57.177 --> 02:58.762
live in perceived harmony.

02:58.762 --> 03:00.514
And we definitely
can't have that.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.432
Now, we just need to make sure
the invasion

03:02.432 --> 03:05.143
spirals out of control,
and then the Cession witches,

03:05.143 --> 03:06.687
and anyone standing
along with them,

03:06.687 --> 03:08.146
will have to fight the military.

03:09.398 --> 03:11.900
Make them kill each other.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.903
And our troops,
who are along for "support,"

03:14.903 --> 03:17.989
can simply mop up afterwards.

03:17.989 --> 03:19.658
What about Alder?

03:21.827 --> 03:23.412
Her power seems to come
from the Mother...

03:25.247 --> 03:27.249
the Mycelium.

03:27.249 --> 03:28.542
KARA: Then you're just gonna
have to step it up

03:28.542 --> 03:30.210
at the drilling sites,
don't you think?

03:30.210 --> 03:32.087
Drown that mushroom.

03:33.797 --> 03:37.259
And this time,
make sure the bitch stays dead.

03:42.097 --> 03:44.975
(theme music playing)

04:49.331 --> 04:51.291
How is she?

04:51.291 --> 04:53.418
She says the Mycelium
can heal her but,

04:53.418 --> 04:55.295
as weak as she is,
her only access point now

04:55.295 --> 04:56.505
is at Fort Salem.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.173
And we need to get her there.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.511
Any idea who tipped off
the Camarilla that we were here?

05:02.511 --> 05:05.806
No, but it had to have been
a member of the Council

05:05.806 --> 05:07.641
or one of their staff,

05:07.641 --> 05:09.476
which is particularly troubling,

05:09.476 --> 05:12.312
since I keep hearing rumblings
about an invasion.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.523
When we get to Fort Salem,
I'll talk to my mom.

05:14.523 --> 05:16.483
Find out what's really going on.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.401
I can tell you
how to sneak onto base.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.445
And once you're there,
ask Alder what she can find out

05:20.445 --> 05:22.280
-about Raelle.
-You don't wanna come with us?

05:23.990 --> 05:25.283
I need to get Edwin
somewhere safe.

05:27.285 --> 05:28.954
That's what she would want.

05:28.954 --> 05:31.081
You and Tally
can take care of Alder.

05:31.081 --> 05:32.290
I'm going home.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.085
They came after Edwin.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.711
They know
where our families are.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.213
I need to make sure
my mom is safe.

05:39.464 --> 05:40.382
Of course.

05:45.554 --> 05:48.098
Are you still obsessing
about your Doomsday prophecy?

05:48.098 --> 05:51.309
Geez, why would I obsess
about the end of the world?

05:51.309 --> 05:52.561
"Doomsday?"
"End of the world?"

05:52.561 --> 05:54.437
-What...
-It's nothing.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.606
Nicte scrambled her Sight
with Spree garbage-work.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.817
I don't know what Tally saw...

05:58.817 --> 06:00.902
but I do know
that the Mother has a plan,

06:00.902 --> 06:03.405
and we must trust her,

06:03.405 --> 06:04.781
for we all have a role to play.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.616
I don't care about her plan.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.743
-I just want Raelle back.
-We all want that.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.538
Right, Tal?

06:13.331 --> 06:16.668
All right, I'll arrange
transportation to Fort Salem.

06:16.668 --> 06:18.795
Get you home, somehow.

06:18.795 --> 06:21.256
And I have a car for you
and Mr. Collar.

06:21.256 --> 06:22.883
But keep your heads down.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.467
Technically,
you're all still wanted.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.177
Thank you.

06:26.177 --> 06:28.013
And when I'm done
playing travel agent,

06:28.013 --> 06:30.473
hopefully I'll have some time
to track down The Marshal

06:30.473 --> 06:32.392
and your missing president.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.895
We appreciate all you're doing
for us, Thelma.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.062
Truly.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.027
All right.
We have our marching orders.

06:42.027 --> 06:43.862
We need to protect our families,

06:43.862 --> 06:46.364
find our girl,
and stop an invasion.

06:47.449 --> 06:48.408
Piece of cake.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.995
We'll meet back here, okay?

06:55.457 --> 06:58.084
It just feels like
every goodbye might be the last.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.169
It won't be.

07:00.462 --> 07:01.338
We won't let it be.

07:08.219 --> 07:10.013
Give us the room, please.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.224
Uh-uh.

07:15.185 --> 07:16.811
I'm sorry to do this to you now,

07:16.811 --> 07:18.146
but I need more information
about that Army.

07:18.146 --> 07:19.064
Any sense of numbers?

07:20.482 --> 07:22.317
A couple thousand that we saw.

07:22.317 --> 07:24.319
But who knows
if they have other facilities.

07:25.528 --> 07:26.905
What's happening?

07:28.657 --> 07:31.159
Silver's about to order me
to invade the Cession.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.911
Congress is making
the final decision as we speak.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.746
But at this point,
it seems inevitable.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.623
I imagine those new troops
will be a part of it.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.291
What are you gonna do?

07:38.291 --> 07:40.627
I'm still bound
by the Salem Accord,

07:40.627 --> 07:43.046
but so is Silver.

07:43.046 --> 07:45.548
If I refuse the order,
he can have me replaced,

07:45.548 --> 07:47.217
-and even disband the Army.
-Okay.

07:47.217 --> 07:49.469
So the trick
is to go along with it?

07:49.469 --> 07:51.054
On the surface.

07:51.054 --> 07:52.389
And then work
to prevent a bloodbath.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.265
Until we can get Wade back

07:54.265 --> 07:56.267
and put an end
to this whole thing.

07:56.267 --> 07:58.311
All right.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.147
You need to rest and recuperate
and stay out of sight.

08:01.147 --> 08:04.651
I will rest once
we've stopped them, general.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.405
Fine.

08:08.405 --> 08:09.322
Just don't let Jarrett
and his goons

08:09.322 --> 08:10.990
know you're back on base.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.118
Now, tell me anything else
you can remember

08:13.118 --> 08:14.786
about this Camarilla army.

08:21.209 --> 08:24.421
(indistinct chatter)

08:24.421 --> 08:27.090
MAN: Come on. Over here now.

08:27.090 --> 08:29.008
-MAN: Back up.
-MAN: What are you doing?

08:29.008 --> 08:30.552
WOMAN: Mom, dad!

08:30.552 --> 08:32.220
We've got our collars.

08:32.220 --> 08:34.097
TALLY:
What's with the red collars?

08:34.097 --> 08:36.099
MAN: Witches have to identify
themselves in public.

08:36.099 --> 08:38.685
And they have to be unable
to use their work.

08:38.685 --> 08:40.061
-Keep your head down.
-MAN: They're innocent.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.187
TALLY:
But they're wearing collars,

08:41.187 --> 08:42.689
why are they being questioned?

08:42.689 --> 08:44.482
MAN: The kids aren't.
It's gotten bad.

08:44.482 --> 08:46.109
There's even escorts
and surveillance everywhere.

08:46.109 --> 08:48.194
This is just part of it.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.321
WOMAN: It has nothing to do
with them. They're innocent.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.703
EDWIN: We will stay on this road
about a hundred miles.

08:56.703 --> 09:00.874
Then we'll head west
on 36 until Chota,

09:00.874 --> 09:02.876
all right? And Quinn's
new place is outside town.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.171
That's all from memory?

09:06.171 --> 09:07.714
Yeah. I don't forget things.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.924
Got a mind like a steel trap.

09:09.924 --> 09:12.385
Nothing slips through
this noggin, Sally.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.262
Stacy. Sydney.

09:14.262 --> 09:16.222
Stella! Stella.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.308
These next six hours
are gonna be just great.

09:18.308 --> 09:20.060
(chuckles)

09:20.060 --> 09:22.395
You, uh, ever do family
road trips as a kid?

09:23.313 --> 09:25.106
We were Dodgers,

09:25.106 --> 09:28.651
so my whole childhood
was one big road trip.

09:28.651 --> 09:29.569
Sorry.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.739
I've been hit
by a lot lately and I--

09:32.739 --> 09:34.324
well, I'm a nervous talker.

09:34.324 --> 09:35.408
Oh, uh...

09:37.660 --> 09:39.454
Willa liked
quiet car rides, too.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.374
I bet you two would've
gotten on real well.

09:47.212 --> 09:48.505
I have no doubt.

09:50.006 --> 09:51.883
(birds chirping)

09:56.638 --> 09:58.098
Nope, a surprise.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.390
-MAN: No way.
-Yes, it was.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.726
MAN: You're being serious
with me right now.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.770
Yup.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.688
MAN: He tailed her for blocks
and she didn't know?

10:05.688 --> 10:07.398
These collars are great.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.236
-(scoffs)
-MAN: Whatever, just open up.

10:11.236 --> 10:13.488
Keeping me waiting is a waste
of both of our time.

10:13.488 --> 10:14.656
You know the drill.

10:14.656 --> 10:16.449
We come in

10:16.449 --> 10:17.951
-and take a look around.
-Oh, damn.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.036
Can you--can you give me
a hand with these?

10:20.036 --> 10:21.704
No, I can't give you a hand.

10:21.704 --> 10:24.207
(tense music playing)

10:30.630 --> 10:33.133
Just a reminder...

10:33.133 --> 10:36.594
you have a legal obligation
to call in anything suspicious.

10:36.594 --> 10:37.720
Yes, sir.

10:43.643 --> 10:44.519
(door closes)

10:47.647 --> 10:49.399
Hi, Mom.

10:53.444 --> 10:57.115
What in the name of the Goddess
are you doing here?

10:57.115 --> 10:59.742
The whole country
is looking for you!

10:59.742 --> 11:01.870
I came to make sure you're safe.

11:01.870 --> 11:04.164
-I'm perfectly fine.
-You're not fine, Mom.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.332
-You're wearing that thing.
-What, this?

11:06.332 --> 11:09.711
-Oh, this is nothing.
-I need you to pack a bag.

11:09.711 --> 11:11.838
I'm taking you to the Cession.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.464
From what I'm hearing
on the news,

11:13.464 --> 11:14.757
the Cession might
not be safe for long.

11:14.757 --> 11:17.802
And I am not leaving my home.

11:17.802 --> 11:20.221
Why do you always
have to be so stubborn?

11:20.221 --> 11:22.891
-I'm trying to help you.
-If you really wanna help me,

11:22.891 --> 11:24.934
you can start by putting
the groceries away.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.644
This is an important night.

11:26.644 --> 11:28.104
What could be so important?

11:28.104 --> 11:29.272
Book club.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.483
Book club?

11:36.029 --> 11:38.114
(car engine revving)

11:46.706 --> 11:48.750
(explosion)

11:48.750 --> 11:51.711
ABIGAIL: They're recording
our work to use it against us.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.797
How can my mother allow this?

11:54.797 --> 11:57.008
She doesn't have
a choice at the moment.

11:57.008 --> 11:59.427
The Salem Accord binds her
to the will of the government.

11:59.427 --> 12:01.137
It's not just words on paper.

12:02.513 --> 12:04.807
It has real power.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.643
You seemed to find a way
around it when you needed to.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.688
And that came at a great cost.

12:16.694 --> 12:19.280
This is no longer
a witch's place.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.698
(groans)

12:22.992 --> 12:25.119
We have to keep going.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.996
We need to get her
to the Mycelium.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.708
PETRA: Based on intelligence,

12:30.708 --> 12:32.126
we know that the fugitives
were last seen

12:32.126 --> 12:34.837
at this Cession chemical plant.

12:34.837 --> 12:37.507
That likely puts them
in the Iroquoian,

12:37.507 --> 12:40.343
Algonquian,
or Siouan territories.

12:40.343 --> 12:43.054
I want troops ready to move
on those three borders

12:43.054 --> 12:45.181
as soon as the President
makes his announcement.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.767
We need to be swift and exact
in order to minimize--

12:47.767 --> 12:49.394
JARRETT: Swift and exact,
but with an iron fist.

12:50.937 --> 12:54.190
All Cession witches
are to be collared, detained,

12:54.190 --> 12:56.859
and then interrogated
by one of my men.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.278
Isn't that right, General?

12:58.278 --> 12:59.445
If those
are the President's orders.

13:02.657 --> 13:03.741
Please continue.

13:04.826 --> 13:07.120
Our primary objective
is to bring in the fugitives.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.038
The Bellweather Unit is--

13:09.038 --> 13:10.832
PETRA: Disregard what
the civilian is babbling about.

13:10.832 --> 13:12.959
Your only orders
are to contain the situation

13:12.959 --> 13:15.378
and do anything you can
to prevent bloodshed,

13:15.378 --> 13:18.840
witch or civilian,
on both sides.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.842
And if the Bellweather Unit
is found,

13:20.842 --> 13:23.177
they are to be brought in alive.

13:23.177 --> 13:26.764
JARRETT: ...abide these orders,
you need to speak up now.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.728
During the operation,
you will be accompanied

13:31.728 --> 13:34.230
by a force of special ops
civilian troops.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.565
They will take lead.

13:36.524 --> 13:37.775
Any questions?

13:39.819 --> 13:42.989
(slow music playing)

13:57.003 --> 13:58.671
(speaking in foreign language)

14:00.506 --> 14:02.091
(speaking in foreign language)

14:02.091 --> 14:04.635
(speaking in foreign language)

14:06.345 --> 14:09.974
That's, that's, that's all, all
the Cherokee I know, I'm afraid.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.893
And yet you're riding
through Iroquois territory

14:11.893 --> 14:13.603
in a Council car.

14:13.603 --> 14:15.605
Yeah, yeah. Thelma Bearkiller,

14:15.605 --> 14:17.065
she, uh--she took pity on me.

14:17.065 --> 14:18.941
She gave me a job as her driver.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.318
And where's
Ms. Bearkiller going?

14:21.819 --> 14:24.614
EDWIN: Oh, that's,
that's Council business. I...

14:25.698 --> 14:26.616
Hmm.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.454
There's been
a lot of strange folk

14:31.454 --> 14:32.789
roaming about
the Cession lately.

14:32.789 --> 14:34.290
-Oh, yeah?
-Would you say

14:34.290 --> 14:36.000
that's all been
on "Council business?"

14:36.000 --> 14:37.919
You're good to go
about your day, sir.

14:37.919 --> 14:39.587
Thank you for your time.

14:39.587 --> 14:41.172
You're good to go
about your day, sir.

14:41.172 --> 14:42.757
Thank you for your time.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.679
What the hell are you thinking?

14:48.679 --> 14:50.306
I had it under control.

14:50.306 --> 14:51.933
I, I was just--

14:51.933 --> 14:53.518
What if someone was watching?

14:53.518 --> 14:55.353
What if he's got a partner
in that truck,

14:55.353 --> 14:56.771
radioing in what you did?

14:57.939 --> 14:59.357
Well, he didn't.

14:59.357 --> 15:02.026
I saw a problem and I solved it.

15:02.026 --> 15:03.986
There are people out there
who are just waiting

15:03.986 --> 15:05.905
for an excuse to stone a witch.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.073
You can't be so reckless.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.449
Why are you so mad?

15:08.449 --> 15:09.909
Because you're all I have left.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.707
You've got me.

15:17.750 --> 15:18.835
Always.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.004
But you got Raelle, too.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.590
Trust me.

15:24.590 --> 15:25.675
I just--

15:26.509 --> 15:27.844
I just wanna hear her voice.

15:30.346 --> 15:34.016
I think I might
be able to do that.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.311
But we need to find something
on the way.

15:40.606 --> 15:41.983
Okay.

15:41.983 --> 15:43.901
I was busy. I didn't have time.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.611
That's okay.
I made extra brownies.

15:45.611 --> 15:47.488
Oh...

15:47.488 --> 15:49.615
Hungry, boys?

15:49.615 --> 15:50.575
Don't mind if I do.

15:50.575 --> 15:52.577
(giggles)

15:52.577 --> 15:53.828
We're working.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.329
Move along.

15:55.329 --> 15:56.873
-Suit yourself.
-Okay.

16:00.418 --> 16:02.336
Oh, man.

16:02.336 --> 16:05.047
These are amazing.
You should try a bite.

16:05.047 --> 16:06.924
I would never eat anything
made by one of them.

16:09.802 --> 16:10.803
Okay.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.476
How's the curry?

16:17.476 --> 16:20.062
Not too hot, is it?

16:20.062 --> 16:22.648
I tend to have a heavy hand
with the spices.

16:26.611 --> 16:29.405
You've made remarkable progress,
Penelope.

16:32.074 --> 16:33.659
I'm very proud.

16:34.911 --> 16:37.788
(indistinct radio music)

16:45.880 --> 16:47.965
Izadora, we need your help.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.383
General?

16:56.474 --> 16:57.516
Penelope?

16:59.977 --> 17:02.021
(screams)

17:04.690 --> 17:07.068
You! You tried to kill me!

17:08.236 --> 17:11.072
(suspenseful music playing)

17:19.830 --> 17:22.208
Does this mean
we can clear our names?

17:22.208 --> 17:25.211
I'm afraid that going public
with her might be premature.

17:25.211 --> 17:30.091
She isn't entirely human yet.

17:30.091 --> 17:32.051
How is it possible?

17:32.051 --> 17:33.553
I saw her die.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.222
We all saw her die.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.975
Apparently,
death isn't what it used to be.

17:40.101 --> 17:41.561
Hello, old friend.

17:41.561 --> 17:42.853
Hello, Sarah.

17:44.689 --> 17:46.774
I don't know how this can be,

17:46.774 --> 17:49.151
but it's good to have you home.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.486
It's good to be...

17:52.029 --> 17:53.406
What's happening?

17:53.406 --> 17:55.408
We need to get her
to the Mycelium.

17:59.370 --> 18:01.247
SCYLLA: Raelle?

18:01.247 --> 18:02.415
Raelle, are you there?

18:05.167 --> 18:07.169
Can you hear me?

18:07.169 --> 18:08.796
Scylla? Is that really you?

18:09.922 --> 18:10.840
It's me!

18:12.091 --> 18:13.092
I love you.

18:16.220 --> 18:20.558
I, I love you so much.

18:20.558 --> 18:22.560
SCYLLA: It's hard to keep
the connection open,

18:22.560 --> 18:25.021
but there's someone
who wants to talk to you.

18:27.815 --> 18:28.733
EDWIN: Rae?

18:30.026 --> 18:31.777
Dad?

18:31.777 --> 18:33.446
EDWIN: Hey, sweetheart,
we missed you.

18:34.572 --> 18:36.032
Where are you?

18:36.032 --> 18:37.908
Are you safe?

18:37.908 --> 18:39.243
I think so.

18:39.243 --> 18:41.621
I really wanna come home, Dad.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.205
-I can't...
-Leave her!

18:43.205 --> 18:44.915
She is safe with us!

18:44.915 --> 18:46.709
-WILLA: (screams)
-Mom, please! No!

18:46.709 --> 18:48.002
Please!

18:50.296 --> 18:53.007
Rae? Raelle?

18:55.092 --> 18:56.802
What, what happened?

18:56.802 --> 18:59.180
Who was that voice?

18:59.180 --> 19:00.973
Was that who I think it was?

19:03.517 --> 19:05.728
How do we talk to Rae again?

19:05.728 --> 19:07.813
It's not Raelle
we need to talk to.

19:09.357 --> 19:12.526
(dramatic music playing)

19:20.326 --> 19:21.661
It's time for me to go now.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.372
Can you take me with you?

19:26.540 --> 19:29.001
Do not fear, Izadora.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.169
Your time will come.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.385
Your sister will be safe.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.595
I promise you.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.515
Tell her to hurry back to us.

19:45.935 --> 19:46.977
Thank you.

19:48.396 --> 19:50.272
We'll meet again soon.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.941
Please bring Raelle back.

19:53.442 --> 19:54.652
I will do what I can.

20:01.283 --> 20:04.161
(dramatic music playing)

20:24.223 --> 20:26.976
WOMAN: I can't relate to that,
obviously.

20:26.976 --> 20:28.728
So, speaking hypothetically.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.688
WOMAN: You think she made
the wrong choice.

20:30.688 --> 20:32.189
WOMAN: Why couldn't she
waited for him to get back?

20:32.189 --> 20:34.066
Okay. I'm ready.

20:34.066 --> 20:34.942
-WOMAN: You know.
-WOMAN: I'm glad she didn't.

20:34.942 --> 20:35.985
He was a total dud.

20:38.362 --> 20:39.780
WOMAN: Yeah.
Right there at all.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.157
Been there, done that.

20:41.157 --> 20:42.450
WOMAN: Yeah, I guess.

20:42.450 --> 20:44.785
But they seemed sweet to you?

20:44.785 --> 20:47.371
And the how about someday...

20:47.371 --> 20:49.039
MAY:
This room is where the records

20:49.039 --> 20:52.418
from the genealogical initiative
are being housed.

20:52.418 --> 20:55.379
If we destroy those records,
we can set back collaring by--

20:55.379 --> 20:57.256
TALLY:
This isn't book club, is it?

21:00.301 --> 21:03.179
Ladies, you remember
my daughter Tally?

21:03.179 --> 21:04.889
The one who couldn't wait
to join the Army

21:04.889 --> 21:06.932
and save the world?

21:06.932 --> 21:08.851
Well, she's all grown up now.

21:08.851 --> 21:10.686
She came home to protect me.

21:10.686 --> 21:13.022
(laughs)

21:13.022 --> 21:15.274
But since she's here,

21:15.274 --> 21:16.650
and stubborn as always,

21:18.068 --> 21:20.321
maybe she could be useful.

21:20.321 --> 21:21.572
Useful for what?

21:25.034 --> 21:28.162
How do you feel about raiding
a government building?

21:28.162 --> 21:30.706
(chuckles)

21:30.706 --> 21:33.834
(pensive music playing)

21:43.302 --> 21:44.220
I can't let you do this.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.681
This is exactly why
I didn't tell you,

21:47.681 --> 21:49.642
to avoid this conversation.

21:49.642 --> 21:53.062
Listen, I know Silver's
witch program is repulsive,

21:53.062 --> 21:54.480
but you're not trained
for this like I am.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.316
Tally, waiting around
is not an option.

21:57.316 --> 22:00.486
What, so the Army
can come to our rescue?

22:00.486 --> 22:02.446
Look what they've done
to help us so far,

22:02.446 --> 22:04.990
-nothing!
-It's too dangerous.

22:04.990 --> 22:07.952
Wow. Deja vu.

22:09.537 --> 22:12.414
I'm a soldier,
I know what I'm talking about.

22:12.414 --> 22:14.917
Well, now I'm fighting,

22:14.917 --> 22:16.794
-and it's you who's afraid.
-I am not afraid.

22:16.794 --> 22:18.337
If you had any idea
what I've seen...

22:18.337 --> 22:19.672
I have to go.

22:21.882 --> 22:25.135
Well then, there's just no way
I'm letting you do this alone.

22:33.769 --> 22:37.231
EDWIN: So it's Willa
that's holding her?

22:37.231 --> 22:39.149
Yes and no.

22:41.735 --> 22:43.320
Willa didn't die in Greenville.

22:46.282 --> 22:48.158
She faked her death

22:48.158 --> 22:50.077
to fight against the Army
and to protect Raelle.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.122
I met her...

22:55.040 --> 22:56.250
I met her in the Spree.

22:58.168 --> 22:59.295
Oh, Willa.

23:00.838 --> 23:03.966
The mission she gave me was
to get Raelle out of the Army.

23:03.966 --> 23:05.801
Willa knew all this was coming.

23:08.804 --> 23:11.473
She died, for real,
less than a year ago.

23:11.473 --> 23:13.017
Saving Raelle.

23:15.436 --> 23:17.313
I'm so sorry, Edwin.

23:17.313 --> 23:19.356
I've been wanting to tell you
for so long.

23:24.945 --> 23:26.614
Please say something.

23:34.622 --> 23:39.168
So how is it
that Willa is holding her now?

23:40.544 --> 23:43.047
There's this power
that can bring people back...

23:43.047 --> 23:45.466
QUINN: And she dwells
in the earth,

23:45.466 --> 23:48.385
it's good ole Mama Mycelium.

23:48.385 --> 23:51.555
Well, whatever secrets and lies,
I don't give a shit.

23:51.555 --> 23:54.475
On Raelle and her general health
and wellbeing,

23:54.475 --> 23:56.644
Willa and I are united.

23:56.644 --> 23:58.812
So how do we talk to her?

24:01.482 --> 24:03.400
They don't teach Farspeech
much anymore, huh?

24:04.777 --> 24:06.528
Sometimes Units get
the training,

24:06.528 --> 24:09.031
but I was Necro, so...

24:09.031 --> 24:12.201
Well, back in the day,
we all got it.

24:14.912 --> 24:16.705
Tricky work.

24:16.705 --> 24:18.666
You do it enough
with the same person,

24:18.666 --> 24:20.501
you imprint.

24:20.501 --> 24:22.670
And it can't be undone.

24:22.670 --> 24:25.506
Came in handy on all
of the sloppy, shit-for-brained

24:25.506 --> 24:28.384
tours they threw us on.

24:28.384 --> 24:32.513
I've talked to Willa
across oceans,

24:32.513 --> 24:34.348
through 16 feet of granite.

24:35.891 --> 24:40.145
If there's a part of Willa
that's still Willa,

24:40.145 --> 24:41.230
she'll hear me.

24:43.732 --> 24:45.567
(suspenseful music playing)

24:49.363 --> 24:51.031
Hello, General.

24:51.031 --> 24:52.199
What is so important
that it couldn't wait

24:52.199 --> 24:53.242
until morning?

24:54.368 --> 24:55.411
(door slams shut)

24:56.787 --> 24:58.664
I thought I told you to rest up
in the infirmary?

24:58.664 --> 25:01.458
It seems like no one
is obeying orders these days.

25:04.044 --> 25:05.671
(pensive music playing)

25:08.215 --> 25:10.509
I'm sorry, ma'am.

25:10.509 --> 25:13.345
I know your orders
were to stay in the Cession,

25:13.345 --> 25:15.014
but Alder needed the Mycelium.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.434
(dramatic music playing)

25:35.868 --> 25:38.495
I don't need
any more hoo-ha darlin'.

25:53.218 --> 25:54.386
(static noise)

25:54.386 --> 25:55.471
QUINN: Willa Collar.

25:59.308 --> 26:01.185
Sure has been a long time.

26:04.229 --> 26:05.564
Hello, Quinn.

26:08.609 --> 26:10.402
Now is not really a good time.

26:12.488 --> 26:14.573
Is that any way
to talk to an old friend?

26:18.744 --> 26:19.953
It's about Raelle.

26:24.208 --> 26:26.835
Got a couple of people here
who need to talk to you.

26:26.835 --> 26:27.753
Look!

26:29.296 --> 26:31.173
(pensive music playing)

26:49.566 --> 26:50.901
Where's Raelle?

26:50.901 --> 26:52.736
Far from those who would
harm her.

26:52.736 --> 26:55.447
Who? Who are you
keeping her from?

26:55.447 --> 26:58.575
WILLA: Those who hate her
for what she is.

26:58.575 --> 27:00.786
Those who poison us out of fear.

27:00.786 --> 27:02.830
She's a part of us now.

27:02.830 --> 27:06.375
Part of the change
that was foretold long ago.

27:06.375 --> 27:07.876
Her place is here.

27:07.876 --> 27:10.838
With us. With me.

27:10.838 --> 27:13.757
A mother cannot knowingly
let her daughter come to harm

27:13.757 --> 27:15.592
or she is not a mother.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.976
(dramatic music playing)

27:25.686 --> 27:26.603
Yeah, honey. It's me.

27:28.564 --> 27:29.606
Edwin.

27:31.191 --> 27:33.360
I'm so sorry.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.028
I let you grieve.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.826
I thought I was
making the right choices.

27:40.826 --> 27:42.661
You understand, right?

27:44.371 --> 27:46.957
They tried to kill
our little girl.

27:51.712 --> 27:56.341
Raelle has a new family now,

27:56.341 --> 27:57.467
who can protect her.

27:59.344 --> 28:02.097
She's got a woman who loves her.

28:02.097 --> 28:03.932
She's got a whole new life now.

28:05.893 --> 28:09.187
We need to let her go
so she can live it.

28:09.187 --> 28:11.023
SCYLLA: Please, Willa.

28:11.023 --> 28:11.899
I'm begging you.

28:14.860 --> 28:18.405
Send her back to me
and I swear I will protect her.

28:19.948 --> 28:21.867
But if you don't let her
come back,

28:21.867 --> 28:23.368
then take me with you

28:24.912 --> 28:26.705
because I can't go on
without her.

28:30.584 --> 28:31.668
I'm so sorry.

28:35.881 --> 28:37.007
I have to go.

28:40.969 --> 28:42.763
Goodbye, my love.

28:42.763 --> 28:45.182
(pensive music playing)

28:48.936 --> 28:49.853
(sighs)

28:58.445 --> 28:59.363
(sobs)

29:02.324 --> 29:04.743
(ominous music playing)

29:22.886 --> 29:24.888
MAY: Should we
just burn it here?

29:24.888 --> 29:26.723
Would be better
if we could avoid

29:26.723 --> 29:28.183
setting off any alarms.

29:28.183 --> 29:30.435
Let's get it out of here
and into the van,

29:30.435 --> 29:32.437
and we'll burn it later.

29:32.437 --> 29:34.314
This new Sight you have,

29:34.314 --> 29:37.067
you'll be able to see
if the guard is coming back?

29:37.067 --> 29:39.319
-I will.
-That must come in handy.

29:39.319 --> 29:40.445
All right.

29:40.445 --> 29:42.030
You're on watch.

29:42.030 --> 29:44.741
(ominous music playing)

29:47.703 --> 29:49.997
Everyone, keep loading.

29:49.997 --> 29:51.415
You and I need to go
to the basement.

29:51.415 --> 29:53.458
There's something
you have to see.

29:53.458 --> 29:55.252
Trust me.

29:55.252 --> 29:57.754
You heard my daughter.
We'll meet you at the van.

30:03.552 --> 30:06.471
-There were twelve Sarah Alders?
-Uh-hmm.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.348
What about Wade? Is she safe?

30:08.348 --> 30:11.601
The Marshal and M left with her
before Hearst got there.

30:11.601 --> 30:13.603
Thelma Bearkiller's out
looking for them.

30:13.603 --> 30:15.313
She thinks
The Marshal might have known

30:15.313 --> 30:17.733
that there was a traitor
on the Council.

30:17.733 --> 30:18.859
Bearkiller will find them.

30:18.859 --> 30:21.236
She's formidable.

30:21.236 --> 30:23.155
But, in the meantime,

30:23.155 --> 30:24.698
what are we gonna do about
Silver's plans

30:24.698 --> 30:26.324
to invade the Cession?

30:26.324 --> 30:28.326
-I have my orders.
-I understand.

30:28.326 --> 30:32.205
Is there any way we can turn
this situation to our advantage?

30:32.205 --> 30:34.708
Well, our best chance
at that remains returning Wade

30:34.708 --> 30:36.334
to power as soon as possible.

30:36.334 --> 30:38.462
Thelma should have Wade
by the time we get back.

30:38.462 --> 30:40.630
I'll return to the Cession
with Abigail,

30:40.630 --> 30:42.632
get Wade,
and bring her back here myself.

30:42.632 --> 30:43.884
And I'll slow-play
the invasion to buy you time.

30:49.139 --> 30:50.057
(sighs)

30:51.433 --> 30:53.435
What?

30:53.435 --> 30:54.770
Just a little motherly pride.

30:56.146 --> 30:57.272
(chuckles)

30:57.272 --> 30:58.398
Carry on, soldier.

31:00.776 --> 31:03.612
(ominous music playing)

31:09.576 --> 31:11.203
These don't come off.

31:12.537 --> 31:14.206
We have to destroy them.

31:14.206 --> 31:16.208
We're not getting
all these crates out of here.

31:16.208 --> 31:17.834
No, we burn them.

31:19.836 --> 31:20.754
I got this.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.927
(speaking in foreign language)

31:28.303 --> 31:30.138
(suspenseful music playing)

31:34.726 --> 31:35.936
Let's go.

31:39.940 --> 31:41.817
(fire crackling)

31:46.947 --> 31:48.824
(dramatic music playing)

31:52.285 --> 31:53.203
What's wrong?

31:55.080 --> 31:58.708
They'll just send more collars
and more men.

31:58.708 --> 32:00.710
All we've done
is slow them down.

32:00.710 --> 32:02.295
Hey.

32:02.295 --> 32:04.965
This is how you win a war,

32:04.965 --> 32:06.633
one battle at a time.

32:06.633 --> 32:08.635
And tonight, we won our battle.

32:08.635 --> 32:10.262
Let's celebrate that.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.763
Okay.

32:11.763 --> 32:12.681
Okay?

32:14.015 --> 32:16.351
(suspenseful music playing)

32:22.566 --> 32:24.442
(explosion)

32:31.741 --> 32:33.243
(women chattering, laughing)

32:33.243 --> 32:34.911
Goddess, protect.

32:38.206 --> 32:40.083
Is there a problem?

32:40.083 --> 32:42.669
There was trouble
at a building in town.

32:44.212 --> 32:46.089
All accounted for.

32:46.089 --> 32:48.592
Why don't you
wrap up this little meeting?

32:48.592 --> 32:50.302
You're cutting it close
to curfew.

32:50.302 --> 32:51.845
Of course.

32:51.845 --> 32:53.763
Same time next week?

32:53.763 --> 32:56.391
-We'll be here.
-Wouldn't miss it for the world.

33:01.313 --> 33:02.355
WOMAN: Have a good night.

33:02.355 --> 33:03.231
MAN: Thank you.

33:13.033 --> 33:14.951
(sighs)

33:16.786 --> 33:18.622
(birds chirping)

33:26.588 --> 33:28.006
Don't worry.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.799
There is a way to get her back,

33:29.799 --> 33:32.385
and I won't stop searching
until I find it.

33:32.385 --> 33:33.553
I know.

33:34.971 --> 33:38.016
And if you find out anything,
you let me know.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.393
Good or bad.
There's no need to protect me.

33:40.393 --> 33:43.396
I will never keep a secret
from you again. I promise.

33:45.065 --> 33:46.942
Hey, look, uh...

33:48.360 --> 33:51.071
whatever choices you made
before you met Rae,

33:51.071 --> 33:53.198
I don't judge.

33:53.198 --> 33:56.534
I know how you feel about her
is real and, uh...

33:56.534 --> 33:57.661
I trust you.

34:00.163 --> 34:01.039
Thank you.

34:02.666 --> 34:04.251
(chuckles) Oh.

34:04.251 --> 34:06.461
That means a lot.

34:06.461 --> 34:08.046
No matter what,

34:08.046 --> 34:10.090
the things you've done
for Raelle,

34:10.090 --> 34:12.008
-I'll never forget.
-Of course you won't.

34:12.008 --> 34:14.261
You have a mind
like a steel trap, Edgar.

34:14.261 --> 34:15.720
Evan?

34:15.720 --> 34:17.055
Um, Eli?

34:17.055 --> 34:19.140
(Edwin laughs)

34:19.140 --> 34:22.143
See? Admit it, you're gonna
miss me on this trip.

34:22.143 --> 34:25.146
But I just promised
to always tell you the truth.

34:25.146 --> 34:27.482
Oh, ouch.

34:27.482 --> 34:29.025
Of course, I'll miss you.

34:30.610 --> 34:31.528
Be safe.

34:40.996 --> 34:43.873
(dramatic music playing)

34:45.500 --> 34:47.335
(engine starts)

35:00.849 --> 35:02.934
So, what are the boys doing?

35:04.519 --> 35:08.106
One is asleep and the other
is reading Tempest Bay.

35:08.106 --> 35:10.358
Whoa, I guess
I better read it myself

35:10.358 --> 35:12.235
in case he asks about it.

35:13.695 --> 35:16.239
Remember the last time
you cooked for me

35:16.239 --> 35:18.074
and you threw it in the sink?

35:22.203 --> 35:24.205
You should try it yourself.

35:24.205 --> 35:26.041
It's good for relieving tension.

35:28.627 --> 35:29.711
(glass shatters)

35:29.711 --> 35:30.754
(both gasping)

35:30.754 --> 35:33.006
(laughing)

35:33.006 --> 35:34.424
It does feel pretty good.

35:34.424 --> 35:36.176
It does, doesn't it?

35:36.176 --> 35:38.053
(both laughing)

35:43.099 --> 35:44.142
I'm sorry.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.935
Well, it's just a plate.

35:45.935 --> 35:48.188
I have plenty,
if you wanna break some more.

35:48.188 --> 35:50.440
No, I'm...

35:50.440 --> 35:53.902
I'm sorry I blamed you
for everything.

35:53.902 --> 35:56.071
I know you were just trying
to protect me.

35:57.364 --> 35:59.282
I've never known you
to apologize

35:59.282 --> 36:01.159
for what you believe in before.

36:04.204 --> 36:05.372
I guess I...

36:08.875 --> 36:10.627
I just understand now

36:10.627 --> 36:13.421
what it's like to be afraid
of a future that...

36:13.421 --> 36:14.964
that's out of your control.

36:17.842 --> 36:20.387
I saw something, Mom.

36:20.387 --> 36:23.390
Something I have to prevent
and I don't know if I can.

36:23.390 --> 36:28.228
That girl I saw last night,
that warrior?

36:28.228 --> 36:31.356
She'll know what to do.

36:31.356 --> 36:34.734
You just have to
trust yourself, Tally.

36:34.734 --> 36:36.569
And get back into the fight.

36:38.780 --> 36:40.281
One battle at a time?

36:40.281 --> 36:41.408
Exactly.

36:43.118 --> 36:45.704
I can't believe
how much you've changed.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.580
Honestly?

36:47.580 --> 36:50.792
I don't think either of us
have changed much at all.

36:53.169 --> 36:54.212
I love you.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.923
I love you, too.

36:56.923 --> 36:58.758
And I'm gonna miss you.

37:00.677 --> 37:04.180
Book club just won't be
the same without you.

37:07.267 --> 37:09.352
My fellow citizens,
at this hour,

37:09.352 --> 37:10.937
the United States military,

37:10.937 --> 37:13.273
along with
an elite civilian force,

37:13.273 --> 37:16.067
are preparing to invade
and occupy the Cession,

37:16.067 --> 37:18.319
with one intention,

37:18.319 --> 37:20.447
to root out the traitors
who assassinated

37:20.447 --> 37:22.407
our beloved former President,

37:22.407 --> 37:24.576
the great Kelly Wade.

37:24.576 --> 37:28.663
This administration will not
tolerate any acts of terrorism,

37:28.663 --> 37:30.373
domestic or abroad.

37:30.373 --> 37:33.293
You must be Captain Quartermain.

37:33.293 --> 37:35.295
You must be Bearkiller.

37:35.295 --> 37:37.088
Abigail and Adil?

37:37.088 --> 37:39.340
We drove all night.
I told them to get some sleep.

37:39.340 --> 37:41.384
PRES. SILVER: May God bless
the United States of America,

37:41.384 --> 37:44.304
and may He bless
all who stand with us.

37:44.304 --> 37:46.347
(ominous music playing)

37:52.979 --> 37:54.439
So that's it then.

37:54.439 --> 37:55.774
General Bellweather will
do her best

37:55.774 --> 37:57.275
to control the invasion.

37:57.275 --> 37:58.777
But we need Wade, now.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.278
Have you been able
to track her down?

38:00.278 --> 38:01.946
She's gone.

38:01.946 --> 38:03.656
There's no trace of her
or The Marshal.

38:03.656 --> 38:05.200
I've been trying
to Farspeak with M,

38:05.200 --> 38:07.327
but so far, no response.

38:07.327 --> 38:10.205
Okay. So how do we find them?

38:10.205 --> 38:13.249
If The Marshal doesn't
wanna be found, then we don't.

38:13.249 --> 38:14.876
And now, if you'll excuse me,

38:14.876 --> 38:17.337
we have an invasion
to prepare for.

38:17.337 --> 38:19.464
Who are all these people?

38:19.464 --> 38:21.424
BEARKILLER:
I knew this day would be coming.

38:21.424 --> 38:24.052
If it wasn't Silver
and the Camarilla,

38:24.052 --> 38:25.595
it was someone else eventually.

38:25.595 --> 38:27.972
So I took precautions.

38:27.972 --> 38:30.350
You built a militia?

38:30.350 --> 38:31.851
You and Bellweather
and the others

38:31.851 --> 38:33.186
are welcome to stay.

38:33.186 --> 38:35.355
You're welcome to go.

38:35.355 --> 38:38.107
But you're going
to need to choose right now.

38:39.692 --> 38:42.529
(suspenseful music playing)

38:44.656 --> 38:47.492
(indistinct yelling)

38:50.328 --> 38:53.164
(ominous music playing)

39:11.933 --> 39:14.227
WILLA: Was this the last
of the drilling sites?

39:14.227 --> 39:16.187
It was.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.773
We'll be able to heal now.

39:18.773 --> 39:21.526
This wasn't just for us.

39:21.526 --> 39:23.361
This was for Raelle.

39:25.613 --> 39:27.448
You're off
to find the rest of the song?

39:27.448 --> 39:28.491
Yes.

39:28.491 --> 39:29.868
Two pieces remain.

39:31.494 --> 39:33.997
But there's something I need
to do first.

39:33.997 --> 39:36.833
(foreboding music playing)

39:42.839 --> 39:44.007
WOMAN: Did you see?

39:45.425 --> 39:47.302
(soldiers chattering)

39:48.887 --> 39:50.555
Cadet, what's going on?

39:50.555 --> 39:53.057
It's General Alder. She's alive!

39:55.101 --> 39:56.311
That can't be, can it?

39:58.730 --> 40:00.773
I intend to find out.

40:00.773 --> 40:03.234
(suspenseful music playing)

40:33.640 --> 40:37.310
Have faith and fear not.

40:38.895 --> 40:41.814
This will always be
a witch's place!

40:41.814 --> 40:44.359
(all cheering)

40:47.487 --> 40:49.530
Do not lose hope.

40:49.530 --> 40:52.742
(dramatic music playing)

41:01.834 --> 41:03.127
Move!

41:03.127 --> 41:04.504
Move! Get out of my way!

41:04.504 --> 41:06.422
Move! Out of my way!

41:06.422 --> 41:08.091
Move!

41:08.091 --> 41:09.968
Move, damn it! Move!

41:13.721 --> 41:16.849
(all cheering)

41:24.399 --> 41:27.235
(suspenseful music playing)

41:33.199 --> 41:36.077
(dramatic music playing)
