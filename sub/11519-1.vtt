Please fasten your seat

02:41.655 --> 02:43.288
We'll be landing shortly.

02:43.290 --> 02:45.223
Thank you.

02:50.630 --> 02:53.698
Comrades, why are we here?

02:53.700 --> 02:55.967
Burning under the sun?

02:55.969 --> 02:57.769
Ask yourselves!

02:57.771 --> 03:02.907
We are here, so the working
class can have more power!

03:02.909 --> 03:07.545
I know we are all
suffering, but we must

03:07.547 --> 03:10.782
fight for our president Allende!

03:18.258 --> 03:20.825
Off! Off! Off!
Off! Off! Off!

03:20.827 --> 03:22.794

03:25.332 --> 03:30.969

03:38.478 --> 03:39.510
What's going on?

03:39.512 --> 03:41.279
Just get out of the way!

03:41.281 --> 03:42.547
Why are they protesting?

03:42.549 --> 03:44.449
Ah, inflation,
food shortages.

03:44.451 --> 03:46.484
It is getting
very bad now.

03:46.486 --> 03:48.653
Oh boy, I should have
taken the Miami route.

03:53.793 --> 03:54.859
That's him!

03:57.664 --> 03:59.631
Wait! I'm getting off.

03:59.633 --> 04:00.999
We must defend...

04:01.001 --> 04:01.933
Are you crazy?

04:01.935 --> 04:03.568
See you in four days!

04:03.570 --> 04:04.736
Make him work for it.

04:07.306 --> 04:09.873
Let us be seen as one
Chilean with dignity.

04:09.876 --> 04:15.546
As a Chilean who stands side
by side with the poorest.

04:15.548 --> 04:18.548
Here I am with the rest
of you, my colleagues.

04:18.551 --> 04:22.620
Because I want to
defend what is ours.

04:25.525 --> 04:29.794
And now, we'll be here
till the end if necessary.

04:30.463 --> 04:32.797
I am here my friends.

04:32.799 --> 04:35.967
Because I've got the conscience
of a working class men.

04:35.969 --> 04:37.602
Hi.

04:45.045 --> 04:48.579
Our right to build a future.

justice and liberty.

04:51.785 --> 04:53.584
Why didn't you tell
me you were coming?

04:53.586 --> 04:55.053
I wanted to surprise you.

04:55.055 --> 04:56.354
You're crazy.

05:21.114 --> 05:22.914

06:52.439 --> 06:53.838
He's great. Very good.

06:53.840 --> 06:55.840
Daniel has designed a
new poster for us

06:55.842 --> 06:57.141
to spread our message.

06:57.143 --> 06:58.643
Daniel, come. Come.

07:07.887 --> 07:08.953
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

07:08.955 --> 07:10.555
You have to speak.

07:10.557 --> 07:11.155
You have to speak
to the people.

07:11.157 --> 07:12.223
- No.
- Yes, come on.

07:12.225 --> 07:13.491
- No.
- Hey.

07:14.794 --> 07:16.227
Speak!

07:19.666 --> 07:22.200
I came to Chile at around
four months ago...

07:22.202 --> 07:24.969
and it has become
my country.

07:24.971 --> 07:27.672
But what we need in this
country is solidarity.

07:27.674 --> 07:29.874
The suffering of the many
must never again be the

07:29.876 --> 07:32.577
foundation for the
wealth of the few.

07:34.681 --> 07:38.583
Chile!

07:42.555 --> 07:46.591
Chile!

08:15.588 --> 08:17.121
Good morning.

08:20.126 --> 08:23.027
President Allende called.

08:25.164 --> 08:27.164
I told him
you were sleeping.

08:56.896 --> 08:58.095
Hey!

09:04.904 --> 09:06.637
Hey.

09:06.639 --> 09:07.572
Give me the camera.

09:07.574 --> 09:08.873
Camera's mine now.

09:28.877 --> 09:30.994
Ah! It was all a ruse
to get the camera!

09:50.617 --> 09:52.149
You have a great eye.

09:52.151 --> 09:54.235
What?

09:54.236 --> 09:56.396
I think your pictures
have got so much better.

10:06.065 --> 10:07.798
These are my favorites.

10:09.068 --> 10:10.968
Look at this one.

10:10.970 --> 10:12.403
So powerful.

10:12.405 --> 10:13.971
You've got quite
an eye yourself.

10:13.973 --> 10:16.140
This is so powerful.

10:18.378 --> 10:22.813
The modern man: Sexy and
practical at the same time.

11:07.160 --> 11:08.259
Hey.

11:08.261 --> 11:09.727
Hm.

11:14.834 --> 11:16.801
I can't believe it...

11:18.071 --> 11:21.238
You have to go
back in two days.

11:23.342 --> 11:25.743
Don't think
about that now.

11:28.347 --> 11:31.048
Why can't you
just stay here?

11:31.050 --> 11:33.084
With me?

11:36.789 --> 11:41.292
Keep the house clean,
do the laundry.

11:41.294 --> 11:43.394
Have your slippers waiting
for you by the fire,

11:43.396 --> 11:45.496
your dinner ready.

11:49.836 --> 11:52.269
I can't stay here.

11:52.271 --> 11:55.239
But maybe it's time
that you came back.

11:57.443 --> 11:59.510
Yeah.

12:06.185 --> 12:07.251
Phone's ringing.

12:07.253 --> 12:08.786
Yeah.

12:08.788 --> 12:10.254
Leave it.

12:10.256 --> 12:11.989
It's my mother.

12:11.991 --> 12:13.124
How do you know?

12:13.126 --> 12:15.059
The disappointed ring.

12:16.295 --> 12:18.162
Today is my
father's birthday.

12:18.164 --> 12:20.331
She wants me
to talk to him.

12:21.134 --> 12:22.800
And you won't, I guess?

12:22.802 --> 12:24.835
I'm done with him.

12:26.472 --> 12:29.006
Daniel...

12:29.008 --> 12:31.142
Take it.

12:44.490 --> 12:46.056
Hello?

12:48.027 --> 12:49.460
What?

12:50.563 --> 12:51.996
Oh, shit!

12:51.998 --> 12:54.031
Yeah.

12:54.033 --> 12:55.299
Thanks, yeah.

12:56.102 --> 12:57.134
We got to go.

12:57.136 --> 12:58.469
Pinochet has taken over.

12:58.471 --> 12:59.904
There's been a
military coup.

12:59.906 --> 13:01.338
They are arresting
Allende supporters.

13:01.340 --> 13:03.374
They confiscated my
posters at the university.

13:03.376 --> 13:05.142
They'll be here soon.
We have to go!

13:05.144 --> 13:06.210
Where're we gonna go?

13:06.212 --> 13:07.044
I don't know.

13:07.046 --> 13:08.479
Just out!

13:33.339 --> 13:35.139
What are you doing?

13:36.275 --> 13:38.275
Stop it!

14:11.210 --> 14:12.643
What are you doing?

14:12.645 --> 14:14.165
- Stop it!
- Hey!

14:34.267 --> 14:35.599
Stop!

14:36.335 --> 14:37.335
Stop!

15:15.374 --> 15:17.975
Attention!

15:18.544 --> 15:22.379
Law and order are being
reestablished in Chile.

15:22.381 --> 15:25.316
Be assured that everybody
who is here by mistake

15:25.318 --> 15:28.185
will soon be released.

15:28.187 --> 15:34.124
Soldiers have orders to shoot
anybody who moves or talks.

17:50.262 --> 17:51.195
No, no!

17:51.197 --> 17:52.396
Hey, hey!

20:39.765 --> 20:42.766
They shoved him in a van
and they drove him away.

20:42.768 --> 20:45.302
A white bus, with a
red cross in a circle.

20:45.304 --> 20:46.937
Like an ambulance.

20:47.740 --> 20:49.573
We know that bus.

20:51.443 --> 20:53.377
So you know where he is?

20:54.680 --> 20:56.480
It's a place in the South.

20:56.482 --> 20:58.482
Completely cut off from
the outside world.

20:58.484 --> 21:01.451
Pinochet's police
take prisoners there.

21:02.521 --> 21:04.288
What's it called?

21:04.290 --> 21:06.456
Colonia Dignidad.

21:06.458 --> 21:08.759
The colony of dignity.

21:08.761 --> 21:11.028
Well we need
to get him out.

21:11.797 --> 21:17.701
Look, this is not about
Daniel or me or him or her.

21:17.703 --> 21:20.003
It's a bigger cause
we are fighting for.

21:22.041 --> 21:24.374
What do you mean?

21:27.079 --> 21:29.880
We can't do
anything for Daniel.

21:29.882 --> 21:31.748
But he's one of you!

21:35.421 --> 21:37.487
We are going into hiding.

21:37.489 --> 21:39.756
And Daniel?

21:39.758 --> 21:42.326
I wish him luck.

22:08.854 --> 22:10.454
He's yours.

22:10.456 --> 22:11.822
Thank you.

22:23.969 --> 22:25.602
You can go.

22:30.843 --> 22:32.676
It's all right.

22:33.612 --> 22:35.645
It's all right.

22:35.647 --> 22:37.547
I'm here now.

22:37.549 --> 22:39.816
It's okay.

22:39.818 --> 22:41.752
You're safe.

22:44.790 --> 22:47.157
There's no danger anymore.

22:47.159 --> 22:49.159
Just relax.

22:56.769 --> 22:59.636
I'm sure you are
mistaken, Miss Kortus.

22:59.638 --> 23:02.439
The Colonia Dignidad is
a long established and

23:02.441 --> 23:05.075
completely respectable
enterprise.

23:05.077 --> 23:08.512
With full government
approval.

23:08.514 --> 23:12.048
We here at Amnesty International
have no further information.

23:12.050 --> 23:14.818
If I were you, I'd stay in
touch with your embassy.

23:14.820 --> 23:16.486
But I've...

23:19.792 --> 23:21.191
Thank you.

23:21.193 --> 23:23.860
Thank you, Miss
Kortus and goodbye.

23:25.464 --> 23:26.663
Goodbye.

23:33.038 --> 23:34.004
I'm being bugged.

23:34.006 --> 23:35.705
Now we can talk.

23:45.584 --> 23:47.751
I'm not getting it.

23:47.753 --> 23:49.553
What is this place?

23:49.555 --> 23:51.855
Allegedly, a
charitable mission.

23:51.857 --> 23:55.492
But really it's a kind of
cult, run by a man called

23:55.494 --> 23:59.563
Paul Schafer, or Pius
as they call him.

23:59.565 --> 24:01.898
He was a lay preacher in
Germany after the war,

24:01.900 --> 24:04.634
came here with his
disciples to set up a

24:04.636 --> 24:07.938
world according to his rules
in the middle of nowhere.

24:07.940 --> 24:09.873
What kind of rules?

24:09.875 --> 24:11.575
No one really knows.

24:12.244 --> 24:14.611
What if I went there?

24:14.613 --> 24:16.112
Joined up.

24:16.114 --> 24:17.180
I wouldn't do that.

24:17.182 --> 24:18.615
Why not?

24:19.952 --> 24:22.919
You may never
get back out.

24:22.921 --> 24:24.654
But I could get in?

24:25.991 --> 24:29.025
Probably.

24:40.639 --> 24:43.707
Dear Roman, you must be
standing in the lobby now,

24:43.709 --> 24:48.778
ready to leave for the airport,
but I won't be coming.

24:48.780 --> 24:50.146
I'm sorry.

24:52.985 --> 24:54.951
Crazy things are happening
here, and sometimes you

24:54.953 --> 24:56.887
have to break the rules.

24:56.889 --> 24:59.656
Isn't that what
you told me?

25:01.860 --> 25:04.027
Can you cover for
me, please Roman?

25:04.029 --> 25:06.029
I'll be on next
week's flight.

25:06.798 --> 25:08.598
And wish me luck.

25:08.600 --> 25:11.635
Love, Lena.

25:11.637 --> 25:13.970
Is everything okay?

25:13.972 --> 25:15.238
Lena's not coming.

25:15.240 --> 25:16.656
She's ill.

25:16.657 --> 25:18.073
She'll be on the
flight next week.

25:18.076 --> 25:20.110
Let's go.

25:43.302 --> 25:45.035
Cross the field and
walk toward the mountain.

25:45.037 --> 25:46.036
You can't miss it.

25:46.038 --> 25:47.270
Thank you.

27:01.413 --> 27:04.147
God bless.

27:04.149 --> 27:05.415
God bless.

27:10.389 --> 27:11.955
Come.

27:26.405 --> 27:27.303
God bless.

27:27.305 --> 27:29.105
God bless.

27:43.455 --> 27:45.088
You wish to join us?

27:45.090 --> 27:46.322
Yes, ma'am.

27:46.324 --> 27:48.091
I want to follow
the way of the Lord.

27:48.093 --> 27:50.193
Don't babble.

27:50.195 --> 27:52.462
The Lord doesn't
like idle talk.

27:52.464 --> 27:54.431
A simple yes will suffice.

28:01.440 --> 28:02.439
Meal time.

28:02.441 --> 28:04.240
Come.

28:12.184 --> 28:13.283
Um...

28:13.285 --> 28:15.919
You won't need
any of this.

28:55.527 --> 28:56.826
Are you all right?

28:58.430 --> 28:59.929
Leave the boy alone.

28:59.931 --> 29:01.097
But he's crying.

29:02.267 --> 29:04.868
It's none of
your business.

29:10.108 --> 29:10.874
God bless.

29:10.876 --> 29:13.060
God bless.

29:13.061 --> 29:15.301
Come, pull yourself together
and stop crying now.

29:18.049 --> 29:19.482
Your turn.

29:21.820 --> 29:23.286
Your turn.

29:24.122 --> 29:25.522
For what?

29:25.524 --> 29:28.258
General confession
with Pius.

30:00.859 --> 30:02.225
Come in.

30:13.605 --> 30:15.872
What's your name?

30:15.874 --> 30:17.340
Lena.

30:18.276 --> 30:24.848
So how have you spent
your life so far, Lena?

30:24.850 --> 30:28.017
I've been searching for God,
but I haven't found him yet.

30:28.019 --> 30:29.953
Ah.

30:29.955 --> 30:32.055
You see, even though
he's everywhere,

30:32.057 --> 30:34.457
he's so hard to find.

30:42.200 --> 30:44.234
Do you know who I am?

30:44.236 --> 30:45.568
Who am I?

30:47.072 --> 30:48.938
You're Pius.

30:48.940 --> 30:51.875
The good shepherd, who
leads his flock to the

30:51.877 --> 30:54.244
Lord's Heavenly Kingdom.

30:55.447 --> 30:57.280
Yeah.

30:58.283 --> 31:03.553
Ours is a poor and humble
life, full of hard work.

31:03.555 --> 31:08.992
Once you join us,
you must remain.

31:08.994 --> 31:10.627
Yes.

31:14.532 --> 31:16.532
You're an
attractive woman.

31:16.534 --> 31:18.501
You must have a boyfriend.

31:18.503 --> 31:20.904
Someone who loves you.

31:20.906 --> 31:22.372
No.

31:22.374 --> 31:24.374
I want to follow
the way of the Lord.

31:28.647 --> 31:31.547
You're not
telling the truth.

31:31.549 --> 31:34.517
I can see it in your eyes.

31:34.519 --> 31:36.653
I see it in your soul.

31:38.423 --> 31:40.256
Is Satan inside you?

31:40.258 --> 31:41.190
No.

31:41.192 --> 31:43.192
Take off you apron.

31:44.195 --> 31:48.164
Take off you apron.

32:01.446 --> 32:03.479
Open your blouse.

32:05.583 --> 32:09.118
Open your blouse.

32:20.532 --> 32:23.533
Just what I thought.

32:23.535 --> 32:26.436
Gray rags on the outside,
the instruments of the

32:26.438 --> 32:28.571
harlot beneath.

32:36.581 --> 32:39.248
I smell the beast of hell.

32:39.250 --> 32:40.316
Did you touch yourself?

32:40.318 --> 32:42.018
No.

32:42.020 --> 32:42.986
Is Satan inside you?

32:42.988 --> 32:44.253
No.

32:44.255 --> 32:47.123
Do you renounce Satan,
the beast of hell?

32:47.125 --> 32:48.441
Yes.

32:48.442 --> 32:49.758
Do you renounce the
sins of the flesh?

32:49.761 --> 32:51.761
Yes.

32:51.762 --> 32:53.762
Do you renounce all
lies and deceit?

32:53.765 --> 32:54.765
Yes!

32:56.701 --> 32:59.435
Tell me the truth.

32:59.437 --> 33:01.738
Why are you here?

33:04.009 --> 33:06.609
I'm here for you Pius.

33:07.712 --> 33:10.346
I need you, that's why.

33:11.316 --> 33:14.784
Oh, now you've
spoken truly.

33:15.520 --> 33:19.422
Feel the Grace of the
Lord coming down on you.

33:24.195 --> 33:27.130
Men, women and children
live separately.

33:27.132 --> 33:30.133
It's best for
everybody that way.

33:30.135 --> 33:32.735
And separate
means separate.

33:41.546 --> 33:42.678
Lena.

33:54.359 --> 33:55.691
Come.

34:02.734 --> 34:04.534
Your bed is back there.

34:08.239 --> 34:10.339
Everything you need
is in the basket.

34:10.341 --> 34:12.742
Use the bandage to tie
down your breasts.

34:12.744 --> 34:14.243
And take off those shoes.

34:14.245 --> 34:16.212
You look like a slut.

34:59.424 --> 35:00.490
This is Lena.

35:00.492 --> 35:02.291
She is one of you now.

35:03.561 --> 35:05.795
Hello.

35:39.531 --> 35:41.297
God bless.

35:41.299 --> 35:42.832
Hello.

35:43.768 --> 35:46.169
Are you from the outside?

35:46.171 --> 35:49.338
Yes, I'm from the outside.

35:49.807 --> 35:51.274
She's from the outside!

35:53.511 --> 35:55.311
That's funny.

35:57.549 --> 35:59.649
Can I tell you a secret?

36:00.618 --> 36:02.785
I may be getting
married soon.

36:02.787 --> 36:04.320
Really?

36:04.321 --> 36:05.854
I thought men and women
here were separated.

36:05.857 --> 36:06.789
They are.

36:06.791 --> 36:08.691
But sometimes...

36:10.595 --> 36:12.195
Get in line.

36:36.821 --> 36:37.954
- Swallow.
- What for? I...

36:37.956 --> 36:39.522
Swallow!

36:46.965 --> 36:48.497
Open.

37:02.647 --> 37:06.382
Work means serving God.

37:06.384 --> 37:09.785
And if you carry the Lord
in your heart, your hands

37:09.787 --> 37:12.989
will do the Lord's work.

37:28.906 --> 37:30.339
My God.

37:30.341 --> 37:32.308
What did you do to him?

37:32.310 --> 37:35.411
We just asked him a
couple of questions.

37:35.413 --> 37:38.547
I don't know if he'll ever
become a human being again.

37:38.549 --> 37:40.283
He could still be useful.

37:40.285 --> 37:42.351
But if the electric shocks
damaged the cortex, nobody

37:42.353 --> 37:43.819
knows what he's
gonna be like.

37:43.821 --> 37:46.722
Everything under God's sun
is good for something.

37:46.724 --> 37:48.491
Got it?

37:48.493 --> 37:51.794
You know, if your people
treat prisoners as badly

37:51.796 --> 37:54.030
as this one,
that's no good.

37:54.032 --> 37:56.666
Worst case, he'll shit
all over himself and die

37:56.668 --> 37:58.801
without revealing
anything.

37:58.803 --> 38:00.436
I see exactly
what you mean.

38:00.438 --> 38:02.938
That's where psychology
comes into play.

38:02.940 --> 38:05.274
Anyone can torture,

38:05.275 --> 38:07.609
but to break a person
without harming physically,

38:07.612 --> 38:09.512
that's an art.

38:19.590 --> 38:22.892
Doro, quicker.

38:26.597 --> 38:28.831
And the rest of you.

39:01.365 --> 39:03.666
Is that how you serve
the Lord you lazy slut?

39:03.668 --> 39:04.734
No, no, please!

39:04.736 --> 39:06.635
I just need to
drink something.

39:06.637 --> 39:08.070
Is that so?

39:08.072 --> 39:11.674
Okay, I'll take
care of that.

39:24.021 --> 39:25.454
Thank you.

39:26.090 --> 39:27.490
Stop!

39:28.092 --> 39:30.726
You think I'm
waiting on you?

39:30.728 --> 39:32.862
If even one drop is
missing by this evening,

39:32.864 --> 39:34.697
I'll make you regret it.

39:34.699 --> 39:38.501
And keep that bucket next
to you at all times.

39:39.404 --> 39:41.670
What are you
cows staring at?

39:56.888 --> 39:58.587
What are you doing here?

40:00.825 --> 40:02.458
Nothing.

40:03.561 --> 40:04.827
Out.

40:04.829 --> 40:06.662
Come on, let's go.

40:40.865 --> 40:43.933
Today's schedule has
been changed.

40:43.935 --> 40:48.537
All women are to come to the
women's hall immediately.

40:48.539 --> 40:52.508
You heard, everyone to
the women's hall now.

40:52.510 --> 40:54.143
Move it!

41:00.985 --> 41:02.084
Doro.

41:02.086 --> 41:03.219
Shhh.

41:03.221 --> 41:05.588
Please, just one thing.

41:06.524 --> 41:08.757
How did you and
your fiance meet?

41:08.759 --> 41:09.792
You mean Dieter?

41:09.794 --> 41:11.093
Yes.

41:11.095 --> 41:13.162
Mixed parade.

41:13.164 --> 41:15.064
What is that?

41:15.066 --> 41:17.099
When there's
important guests,

41:17.101 --> 41:20.035
we sing and get to
wear our Sunday best.

41:20.037 --> 41:22.705
And suddenly,
there was Dieter.

41:22.707 --> 41:24.707
When was that?

41:24.709 --> 41:27.042
Two... no, three.

41:27.044 --> 41:28.043
Three years ago.

41:28.045 --> 41:29.712
Three years ago?

41:29.714 --> 41:31.146
And since then?

41:31.148 --> 41:32.748
We are in love.

41:32.750 --> 41:35.618
Yes, but when do
you see each other?

41:35.620 --> 41:38.721
We don't.

41:38.723 --> 41:40.923
You haven't seen
him for three years?

41:40.925 --> 41:41.991
Couldn't.

41:41.993 --> 41:43.826
No Mixed Parades.

41:46.163 --> 41:51.534
You can't see because
you're eyes are blind.

41:52.937 --> 41:57.873
And you can't feel,
because your hearts

41:57.875 --> 42:00.109
are made of stone.

42:02.847 --> 42:05.748
But I, I, I can see,
I can feel.

42:05.750 --> 42:06.882
Yes.

42:06.884 --> 42:09.652
Because it's God
looking through me.

42:09.654 --> 42:11.086
Yes!

42:11.088 --> 42:13.022
It's God talking
through me!

42:13.024 --> 42:15.024
Yes!

42:15.726 --> 42:19.161
I'm calling you, Alfred.

42:19.163 --> 42:20.896
Come out of your coffin.

42:20.898 --> 42:22.097
Get up and live.

42:22.099 --> 42:24.233
Come and rise.

42:24.235 --> 42:31.140
Rise from death to celebrate
the Lord Almighty.

42:31.142 --> 42:32.575
Yes!

42:32.577 --> 42:33.577
Lord Almighty!

42:37.148 --> 42:38.314
Because you shall live.

42:38.316 --> 42:39.715
Yes, live!

42:39.717 --> 42:41.750
- You shall live.
- Alfred, live!

42:44.221 --> 42:45.921
Yes.

42:46.657 --> 42:48.290
I am the resurrection
and the life.

42:48.292 --> 42:49.942
Yes.

42:49.943 --> 42:51.593
And I'm telling
you, Alfred.

42:51.596 --> 42:56.265
Who believes shall see
the glory of the Lord.

42:58.936 --> 43:02.338
I'm telling you to
overcome death.

43:02.340 --> 43:03.339
And rise!

43:03.341 --> 43:04.773
Rise!

43:04.775 --> 43:06.275
Rise!

43:11.882 --> 43:13.716
Pius.

43:13.718 --> 43:16.986
We all saw it and
we all heard it.

43:16.988 --> 43:18.954
When you called Alfred...

43:18.956 --> 43:22.358
it wasn't your voice,
it was God's voice!

43:24.629 --> 43:27.396
But the miracle couldn't
take place, because

43:27.398 --> 43:30.032
there's too much sin
in our community.

43:31.702 --> 43:33.102
Too much sin!

43:55.026 --> 43:56.225
You stay here.

43:58.396 --> 43:59.896
Who's that?

43:59.897 --> 44:01.397
That's Hans. He's
one of us now.

44:01.399 --> 44:02.965
Hans?

44:02.967 --> 44:05.167
I... I'm Hans.

44:05.670 --> 44:08.137
He's as dumb as they come,
but Pius wants you to keep

44:08.139 --> 44:09.405
an eye on him.

44:09.406 --> 44:10.672
What am I going
to do with him?

44:10.675 --> 44:12.374
Just give him an easy job.

44:12.376 --> 44:14.777
Can you handle that?

44:25.823 --> 44:28.957
Ga... ga...
good to meet you.

44:57.088 --> 44:59.188
How's it going, Hans?

44:59.190 --> 45:01.256
Fine.

45:22.012 --> 45:23.212
Lena?

45:24.215 --> 45:25.981
Come here a minute.

45:28.519 --> 45:32.287
I know it's awfully
difficult at the beginning.

45:32.289 --> 45:37.126
Everyone struggles at first,
but it's just a test.

45:37.128 --> 45:39.294
And you're doing very
well, I must say.

45:39.296 --> 45:40.963
Honestly.

45:40.965 --> 45:43.065
Thank you, Aunt Gisela.

45:46.303 --> 45:50.372
I like you, Lena, and the
others like you, too.

45:50.374 --> 45:52.174
I don't know.

45:52.176 --> 45:53.842
Yeah, they do.

45:53.844 --> 45:55.978
I can tell.

45:55.980 --> 45:58.013
Especially Doro.

45:58.015 --> 46:00.115
She just loves you.

46:01.786 --> 46:02.951
And now she's
getting married.

46:03.921 --> 46:05.287
She said so.

46:05.289 --> 46:07.055
I'm so happy for her.

46:07.491 --> 46:09.858
She must have told
you about her fiance?

46:09.860 --> 46:12.861
Not really, just that...

46:12.863 --> 46:17.132
they're in love and
his name's Dieter.

46:17.134 --> 46:20.435
Yeah, Dieter.

46:20.437 --> 46:22.304
Doro and Dieter.

46:22.306 --> 46:24.573
What a perfect match.

46:25.176 --> 46:28.243
Get back to work now.

47:13.324 --> 47:14.957
Hans?

47:15.893 --> 47:18.327
Where is that
bloody moron?

47:18.896 --> 47:20.095
Hans!

47:21.098 --> 47:22.898
What the fuck
are you doing?

47:22.900 --> 47:23.565
Nothing.

47:23.567 --> 47:25.934
I, I, I need to pee.

47:27.071 --> 47:28.136
Did, did
you pee in here?

47:28.138 --> 47:29.538
No.

47:29.540 --> 47:31.373
Did you piss into any
of these containers?

47:31.375 --> 47:32.140
Uh, no.

47:32.142 --> 47:34.309
Take a piss outside.

47:35.312 --> 47:37.012
Damn it.

47:44.088 --> 47:45.654
Dorothea, come along.

47:45.656 --> 47:47.356
Everyone else,
go back to sleep.

47:47.358 --> 47:50.425
No, no, no, no...

47:50.427 --> 47:51.994
No, no, no!

47:51.996 --> 47:53.395
I said back to sleep.

47:53.931 --> 47:56.632
Dorothea, don't
make it worse.

47:56.634 --> 47:58.901
Don't make it worse!

47:58.903 --> 48:00.168
Oh.

48:00.504 --> 48:01.403
Come!

48:01.405 --> 48:02.905
No! Please, don't.

48:02.907 --> 48:04.306
No!

49:11.709 --> 49:13.175
Go.

49:18.582 --> 49:19.582
It still stinks.

49:24.355 --> 49:27.322
Not even this divine music
can drive the devil out.

49:27.324 --> 49:28.757
No.

49:28.759 --> 49:31.093
I still smell the harlot.

49:31.095 --> 49:32.728
Rotten to the core.

49:32.730 --> 49:34.329
Yes.

49:34.331 --> 49:36.365
But it's not your
fault, woman.

49:36.367 --> 49:38.633
That you have Satan
inside of you.

49:42.773 --> 49:44.606
So you want to marry, eh?

49:49.747 --> 49:52.147
Who would want
to marry you?

49:52.149 --> 49:53.782
You ugly, stinking cunt?

49:56.086 --> 49:58.487
I can't hear you.
Speak up, woman!

50:00.557 --> 50:02.257
I know who.

50:06.230 --> 50:08.196
Dieter, right?

50:11.335 --> 50:13.368
Dieter.

50:15.305 --> 50:17.339
Dieter, Dieter, Dieter.

50:17.808 --> 50:23.612
What do you say to the proposal
from this ugly, stinking cow?

50:27.184 --> 50:28.784
Well?

50:31.221 --> 50:32.487
It stinks.

50:34.058 --> 50:35.157
That's right.

50:35.159 --> 50:37.526
That's right,
Dieter, it stinks.

50:38.328 --> 50:40.295
Why don't you come up here
and relieve your lover of

50:40.297 --> 50:42.164
her stench?

50:43.634 --> 50:47.169
Those are the demons
in her that you smell.

50:47.604 --> 50:49.304
That we must drive out.

50:49.306 --> 50:50.772
Yes!

50:50.774 --> 50:52.207
So we can breathe again!

50:52.209 --> 50:53.308
Yes!

50:53.310 --> 50:54.376
We must drive it out!

50:54.378 --> 50:55.510
Yes!

50:55.512 --> 50:57.512
So we are gonna
breathe again.

50:57.514 --> 50:59.614
No, please!

51:01.618 --> 51:03.385
Are you just going to
stand there like a fool?

51:03.387 --> 51:04.252
That doesn't help her.

51:04.254 --> 51:05.754
Come on.

51:05.756 --> 51:07.756
What we do we do
with the love.

51:07.758 --> 51:09.291
Yes.

51:09.293 --> 51:10.358
What we do we do
with the love!

51:10.360 --> 51:12.527
Yes!

51:17.234 --> 51:19.101
Yeah!

51:20.204 --> 51:21.764
Yeah!

51:22.439 --> 51:24.406
Yeah!

51:25.109 --> 51:26.808
Yeah!

51:30.114 --> 51:32.280
Dieter, Dieter, Dieter.

51:32.282 --> 51:33.682
The whore has enslaved you.

51:33.684 --> 51:35.250
Yeah!

51:35.252 --> 51:36.518
That's the work
of the devil!

51:36.520 --> 51:37.786
Yes!

51:37.788 --> 51:39.221
That is the work
of the devil!

51:39.223 --> 51:41.189
Yes!

51:41.191 --> 51:43.558
Why don't you come up here
and help him? Come on!

51:44.361 --> 51:45.794
No!

51:45.796 --> 51:47.762
No!

51:50.167 --> 51:52.300
No!

51:54.371 --> 51:55.704
There's someone at the window!

52:29.239 --> 52:30.305
Gisela.

52:30.307 --> 52:31.873
This place is a mess.

52:33.443 --> 52:35.310
Sorry, Pius.

53:16.220 --> 53:18.420
Take off your glasses.

53:18.422 --> 53:20.488
Pius, please.

53:21.925 --> 53:23.992
Glasses off!

53:47.317 --> 53:52.020
Your sister, Dorothea, has
suddenly fallen very ill.

53:52.022 --> 53:55.457
She was taken to the
hospital for treatment.

53:55.459 --> 53:58.460
Pray for her to get
healthy and let her

53:58.462 --> 54:02.430
example be a
reminder to us all.

54:25.489 --> 54:26.888
Ursel!

54:28.792 --> 54:30.558
What are you doing here?
Go away!

54:30.560 --> 54:31.793
Please.

54:36.566 --> 54:38.066
How's Doro?

54:39.403 --> 54:41.336
She'll survive.

54:41.338 --> 54:42.871
I'm sorry.

54:42.873 --> 54:44.406
Will you tell her?

54:48.745 --> 54:51.446
What was that last night?

54:51.448 --> 54:53.081
Men's gathering.

54:55.652 --> 54:57.552
What do you have to
do to be taken there?

54:57.554 --> 54:58.987
Why do you ask?

54:58.989 --> 55:01.556
Ursel!

55:19.076 --> 55:20.909
One... more?

55:20.911 --> 55:22.510
One... more?

55:22.512 --> 55:24.512
Okay, do one more!

55:47.137 --> 55:48.536
Mealtime.

57:00.710 --> 57:02.510
Hans?

57:02.512 --> 57:04.779
Men's gathering.

57:05.649 --> 57:08.082
Where is the bloody moron?

57:08.084 --> 57:09.984
Hans!

57:25.902 --> 57:27.702
Fuck it.

57:40.250 --> 57:41.850
So you fooled Gisela.

57:41.852 --> 57:43.618
Be my guest.

57:43.620 --> 57:47.689
That's what she deserves,
that fat, ugly, stinking cow.

57:49.993 --> 57:52.494
But that you would
go and defile our

57:52.496 --> 57:57.165
water with your stinking,
whorish, naked body.

57:57.167 --> 57:58.766
Naked!

57:58.768 --> 58:00.235
Oh!

58:00.237 --> 58:01.970
Defies belief.

58:06.643 --> 58:08.710
I took you in
like a daughter.

58:08.712 --> 58:10.812
I made you one of us.

58:10.814 --> 58:13.114
I gave you
everything you need.

58:13.116 --> 58:15.984
Hasn't she lived here
snug as bug in a rug?

58:15.986 --> 58:17.952
Yeah!

58:20.757 --> 58:23.525
Now you show
your true face.

58:23.527 --> 58:28.696
For all women are full of lies,
deceit and whorish demons.

58:30.267 --> 58:32.700
Your tears won't save you.

58:32.702 --> 58:35.870
As any loving father
should, I will now cleanse

58:35.872 --> 58:39.908
you of the demons
that are within you.

58:44.114 --> 58:46.114
Yeah!

58:50.720 --> 58:52.887
Yeah!

58:56.860 --> 58:58.826
Yeah!

58:58.828 --> 59:00.228
Come on! Show your
brotherly love!

59:00.230 --> 59:01.996
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

59:07.170 --> 59:08.169
Fuck!

59:08.171 --> 59:09.171
Escape! Escape!

59:10.640 --> 59:11.306
Go get the cars!

59:11.308 --> 59:12.707
Get in the cars!

59:14.678 --> 59:16.210
Go! Go! Go!

59:18.281 --> 59:19.814
Get the weapons!

59:19.816 --> 59:21.115
Attention! Attention!

59:21.117 --> 59:24.619
Contact with the electric
fence in sector seven.

59:24.621 --> 59:26.354
All men to be armed.

59:26.356 --> 59:31.326
I repeat: Contact with the
electric fence in sector seven.

59:33.863 --> 59:35.163
Get the dogs!

59:35.165 --> 59:37.098
Get the dogs!

59:47.911 --> 59:49.944
Look, over there!

59:52.082 --> 59:53.214
Here!

59:54.651 --> 59:55.883
Damn it, it's Hans.

59:55.885 --> 59:57.885
That idiot must have
run into the fence.

59:57.887 --> 01:00:01.122
Ah, let's pick him up and
bring him to the hospital.

01:00:13.837 --> 01:00:18.206
All I can see is
sadness in your eyes.

01:00:19.142 --> 01:00:21.843
There's doubts
in your heart.

01:00:21.845 --> 01:00:24.812
Turmoil in your soul.

01:00:29.352 --> 01:00:32.654
Oh, you think you
made a mistake.

01:00:33.089 --> 01:00:36.090
That you shouldn't
have come here.

01:00:36.092 --> 01:00:38.059
You regret.

01:00:38.061 --> 01:00:40.895
You regret deeply.

01:00:41.731 --> 01:00:43.197
It's okay.

01:00:43.199 --> 01:00:45.400
It's okay, Lena.

01:00:45.402 --> 01:00:47.869
We're not perfect.

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.740
None, none of us.

01:00:53.743 --> 01:00:56.811
We all lose our
way sometimes.

01:00:59.082 --> 01:01:04.052
The Lord loves us,
imperfect as we are.

01:01:04.754 --> 01:01:08.690
Open your heart to the
Lord and he will requite

01:01:08.692 --> 01:01:11.959
all your doings
with his love.

Attention: This is
today's final schedule.

01:02:51.327 --> 01:02:54.529
All nurses will wear
their nurse's uniform.

01:02:54.531 --> 01:02:57.298
All others Sunday best.

01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:00.968
Aprons must be absolutely
clean and tied at the back

01:03:00.970 --> 01:03:03.204
with a ribbon.

01:03:03.206 --> 01:03:06.474
After the presidential
limousine has passed by,

01:03:06.476 --> 01:03:08.876
we'll all follow
in mixed parade.

01:03:08.878 --> 01:03:10.895
That's better.

01:03:10.896 --> 01:03:12.913
After the speech all women
are to return to the

01:03:12.916 --> 01:03:16.051
women's quarters.

01:03:16.052 --> 01:03:19.187
All men will stand at attention
in front of the Freihaus.

01:03:21.457 --> 01:03:22.990
Thank you.

01:03:24.194 --> 01:03:25.326
Quiet.

01:03:26.563 --> 01:03:28.162
Quiet!

01:03:29.566 --> 01:03:31.265
We'll go through it.

01:03:31.901 --> 01:03:33.100
Now you see the car.

01:03:36.105 --> 01:03:37.839
Stop!

01:03:39.008 --> 01:03:40.341
Very good.

01:03:46.983 --> 01:03:48.482
Viva!

01:04:14.244 --> 01:04:16.611
Mixed Parade!

01:05:03.426 --> 01:05:06.427
Mr. President,
my dear friend.

01:05:06.429 --> 01:05:12.967
I thank God's wisdom that
the reins of this country

01:05:12.969 --> 01:05:14.402
are in your hands.

01:05:14.404 --> 01:05:16.003
Daniel?

01:05:16.005 --> 01:05:21.609
And you do us the honor of
visiting Colonia Dignidad.

01:05:21.611 --> 01:05:24.111
Meet me at the
potato shed tonight.

01:05:26.049 --> 01:05:28.216
I have night shift.

01:05:28.217 --> 01:05:30.384
God bless our President
General Pinochet!

01:05:55.478 --> 01:05:58.379
Knock-offs, but better
than the originals.

01:05:59.015 --> 01:06:01.716
Can you provide five hundred
by the end of the year?

01:06:01.718 --> 01:06:03.351
If you order now.

01:06:03.353 --> 01:06:04.452
And the poison gas.

01:06:04.454 --> 01:06:05.486
We want both.

01:06:05.488 --> 01:06:08.055
Of course, the
Sarin is ready.

01:06:11.361 --> 01:06:14.195
How can we be
sure it works?

01:06:14.197 --> 01:06:16.297
We could demonstrate
on a dog.

01:06:16.299 --> 01:06:19.300
We are not planning
to use it on dogs.

01:06:19.302 --> 01:06:20.534
Uh-huh.

01:06:24.507 --> 01:06:29.343
Everything under God's sun
is good for something.

01:06:33.116 --> 01:06:34.181
We desire...

01:06:34.183 --> 01:06:35.483
To be sober and pure!

01:06:35.485 --> 01:06:36.384
We deny...

01:06:36.386 --> 01:06:38.285
All lust of the flesh!

01:06:38.287 --> 01:06:39.186
We submit...

01:06:39.188 --> 01:06:41.088
Ourselves to the Lord!

01:06:41.090 --> 01:06:43.290
A volunteer
for guard duty?

01:06:43.292 --> 01:06:44.425
Huh?

01:06:44.427 --> 01:06:45.593
Not you, Hans.

01:06:45.595 --> 01:06:47.528
Why not?

01:06:50.133 --> 01:06:52.400
Why don't you let him?

01:06:52.402 --> 01:06:54.301
For once?

01:07:50.827 --> 01:07:54.195
I'm so sorry they brought
you here as well.

01:07:56.099 --> 01:07:58.466
Nobody brought me here.

01:08:01.704 --> 01:08:04.638
I joined up...

01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:06.740
to find you.

01:08:27.162 --> 01:08:29.363
Schafer understands that
family gives you home,

01:08:29.365 --> 01:08:31.499
a sense of belonging.

01:08:31.501 --> 01:08:33.434
So he broke up the
families, separated men

01:08:33.435 --> 01:08:35.336
from women, children
from their parents.

01:08:35.337 --> 01:08:37.470
That's why he
became so powerful.

01:08:38.307 --> 01:08:40.274
Well then how they have the
children in the first place?

01:08:40.276 --> 01:08:42.376
Once in a while he gives
them permission to meet,

01:08:42.377 --> 01:08:44.377
but the children don't
know their parents.

01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:47.448
They take away the babies from
their mothers at three months.

01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:48.782
How do you know
all of this?

01:08:48.783 --> 01:08:50.317
They don't hide
anything from me.

01:08:50.319 --> 01:08:51.852
I'm just a retard.

01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:56.557
We have to get
out of here.

01:08:56.559 --> 01:08:59.760
It's all fenced in,
the entire compound.

01:08:59.761 --> 01:09:01.662
They even have
spring guns.

01:09:01.663 --> 01:09:04.465
I almost got killed, when
I tried to get away.

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:06.332
When was that?

01:09:06.335 --> 01:09:07.734
About three months ago.

01:09:07.737 --> 01:09:09.336
That's why you
weren't there.

01:09:09.337 --> 01:09:10.470
Where?

01:09:10.473 --> 01:09:13.274
Men's gathering.

01:09:13.276 --> 01:09:16.210
I made them take me there
so that you would see me.

01:09:21.250 --> 01:09:23.184
There's something down there.

01:09:36.698 --> 01:09:39.399
Wait, I'll go
and have a look.

01:09:50.345 --> 01:09:52.513
It's a tunnel.

01:10:22.311 --> 01:10:23.444
Fuck.

01:10:55.611 --> 01:10:56.777
Daniel!

01:11:15.564 --> 01:11:16.630
Lena.

01:11:18.067 --> 01:11:19.400
Is it time already?

01:11:19.402 --> 01:11:21.535
What do you think
I'm here for?

01:11:22.505 --> 01:11:24.505
Uh, I'm not finished, yet.

01:11:28.444 --> 01:11:30.411
So you'll continue
tomorrow.

01:11:33.316 --> 01:11:35.316
Come now.

01:13:42.545 --> 01:13:43.610
Attention.

01:13:43.612 --> 01:13:45.746
Lena, come to see Pius.

01:13:45.748 --> 01:13:49.149
Lena, come to see
Pius immediately!

01:14:05.901 --> 01:14:07.768
How long?

01:14:07.770 --> 01:14:11.004
Seven minutes,
twenty-three seconds.

01:14:11.006 --> 01:14:13.740
If your conscience was
clear, you would have been

01:14:13.742 --> 01:14:15.943
here in less than five.

01:14:16.579 --> 01:14:18.045
Come.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.033
Look at her.

01:14:40.035 --> 01:14:42.202
She's the savvy one.

01:14:43.539 --> 01:14:45.973
Keeps her eyes open.

01:14:45.975 --> 01:14:49.176
She knows what's
going on, right?

01:14:55.818 --> 01:14:57.684
Do you know Ursel?

01:14:59.889 --> 01:15:02.155
She got brains.

01:15:02.157 --> 01:15:05.192
But the brainy ones,
you can't trust them.

01:15:05.194 --> 01:15:07.060
They lose their
way too easily.

01:15:07.062 --> 01:15:08.762
Yes.

01:15:09.098 --> 01:15:12.733
So I want you to keep an
eye on Ursel, tell me what

01:15:12.735 --> 01:15:14.668
you see and hear.

01:15:14.670 --> 01:15:18.605
Because there's something going
on with her and I can smell it.

01:15:19.108 --> 01:15:21.775
I hardly ever see Ursel.

01:15:21.777 --> 01:15:24.011
Well I can fix that.

01:15:43.198 --> 01:15:44.665
Go.

01:16:01.083 --> 01:16:02.916
What are you doing here?

01:16:04.219 --> 01:16:05.986
Just helping out.

01:16:12.861 --> 01:16:14.194
What's wrong?

01:16:19.768 --> 01:16:21.835
I just don't know how
you stand it here.

01:16:26.842 --> 01:16:29.009
I was nine when
we came here.

01:16:29.011 --> 01:16:31.111
I don't know
anything else.

01:16:38.921 --> 01:16:40.921
Your parents
are here, too?

01:16:48.397 --> 01:16:50.998
Gisela is my mother.

01:16:57.006 --> 01:16:58.905
Inhale, exhale.

01:17:13.422 --> 01:17:14.788
Physically he's fine.

01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:17.057
Fine.

01:17:17.058 --> 01:17:19.339
But we should take some
blood as well and analyze it.

01:17:20.062 --> 01:17:21.228
Blood test.

01:17:28.170 --> 01:17:31.071
Let's wait for the blood count
and test the gas tomorrow.

01:17:31.073 --> 01:17:32.873
Thank you my friend.

01:17:54.063 --> 01:17:56.096
It's an entire system
of tunnels.

01:17:56.098 --> 01:17:57.898
I figured it
out last night.

01:17:57.900 --> 01:18:00.060
You won't believe what
they built down there.

01:18:00.269 --> 01:18:02.936
It's kilometers of shafts
with electricity and air

01:18:02.938 --> 01:18:05.072
ventilation and
everything.

01:18:05.074 --> 01:18:06.907
But there's this one tunnel
which is blocked

01:18:06.909 --> 01:18:08.141
by a metal door.

01:18:08.143 --> 01:18:10.911
It's the only tunnel
which is blocked.

01:18:10.913 --> 01:18:12.746
This shaft heads
right for the fence.

01:18:12.748 --> 01:18:13.780
I think it leads outside.

01:18:13.782 --> 01:18:14.848
Out of the colony.

01:18:14.850 --> 01:18:15.982
Are you sure?

01:18:15.984 --> 01:18:17.784
We have to give it a try.

01:18:19.922 --> 01:18:21.888
I also found another exit.

01:18:21.890 --> 01:18:24.191
It leads out into
the workshop.

01:18:24.193 --> 01:18:26.326
The tunnels connect
the entire Colonia.

01:18:26.328 --> 01:18:29.062
It's really crazy.

01:18:29.063 --> 01:18:31.797
And I'm sure, only Schafer and
a few others know about it.

01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:33.934
I mean, there is like a
whole secret world going

01:18:33.936 --> 01:18:37.838
on underneath and most of
them, they have no clue.

01:18:43.145 --> 01:18:44.845
Lena, I'm sure
we can make it.

01:18:44.847 --> 01:18:47.214
We can get out through the
tunnels, but we have to

01:18:47.216 --> 01:18:48.248
leave tonight.

01:18:48.250 --> 01:18:49.449
Tonight?

01:18:49.451 --> 01:18:51.418
They're preparing a
test for tomorrow.

01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:52.853
What test?

01:18:56.358 --> 01:18:58.458
Poison gas.

01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:00.994
The idea is I...

01:19:00.996 --> 01:19:02.963
I won't survive.

01:19:03.465 --> 01:19:05.332
My god.

01:19:06.435 --> 01:19:07.901
Look after these.

01:19:07.903 --> 01:19:09.870
In case I don't make it.

01:19:10.873 --> 01:19:12.939
What is this?

01:19:12.941 --> 01:19:14.808
Pictures I took
from the tunnels.

01:19:14.810 --> 01:19:16.810
The underground rooms.

01:19:16.812 --> 01:19:19.479
We have to prove what's
going on in here.

01:19:19.481 --> 01:19:20.847
I don't wanna prove
anything, I just want to

01:19:20.849 --> 01:19:22.466
get out of here alive.

01:19:22.467 --> 01:19:24.084
But we have to nail these
guys, we have to stop this.

01:19:24.086 --> 01:19:25.285
With a few photographs?

01:19:25.287 --> 01:19:27.254
Yes!

01:19:27.256 --> 01:19:29.055
Don't you get it?

01:19:29.057 --> 01:19:30.857
If you hadn't taken those
photos in Santiago we

01:19:30.859 --> 01:19:32.392
wouldn't even be here.

01:19:32.394 --> 01:19:34.227
So do me a favor, stop
playing the revolutionary,

01:19:34.229 --> 01:19:35.962
hell-bent on
saving the world.

01:19:35.964 --> 01:19:37.564
You're gonna
get us killed!

01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:20.006
And no chattering.

01:20:20.008 --> 01:20:21.208
What shall I peel with?

01:20:21.210 --> 01:20:23.310
Didn't you bring
your knife?

01:20:23.979 --> 01:20:25.312
How stupid can you be?

01:20:25.314 --> 01:20:27.848
- I didn't know...
- Not another word!

01:20:27.850 --> 01:20:29.382
I'll get you a knife.

01:20:44.032 --> 01:20:45.498
Why are you here?

01:20:46.602 --> 01:20:48.501
You tell me.

01:20:49.037 --> 01:20:53.473
You think I don't know
Schafer told you to spy on me?

01:20:53.475 --> 01:20:56.943
Maybe he told me
to spy on you, too.

01:20:58.247 --> 01:20:59.512
You've got brains, Lena.

01:20:59.514 --> 01:21:01.948
Just like Ursel.

01:21:01.950 --> 01:21:03.870
But the brainy
ones are dangerous.

01:21:07.923 --> 01:21:10.023
Why is he doing all this?

01:21:10.025 --> 01:21:11.191
The whole place.

01:21:11.193 --> 01:21:13.059
I don't understand it.

01:21:13.061 --> 01:21:15.395
Because there is
nothing to understand.

01:21:15.397 --> 01:21:17.297
He loves it.

01:21:17.299 --> 01:21:20.166
His power, the music,
the little boys.

01:21:20.168 --> 01:21:22.636
It's his heaven on earth.

01:21:25.207 --> 01:21:27.941
Did you really believe
he was a man of God?

01:21:27.943 --> 01:21:29.342
Of course.

01:21:30.379 --> 01:21:32.512
But not anymore.

01:21:40.389 --> 01:21:42.389
So have the
two of you met?

01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:46.960
What do you mean?

01:21:49.197 --> 01:21:51.331
You know what I mean.

01:21:52.501 --> 01:21:55.602
The picture
inside your cross.

01:21:55.604 --> 01:21:58.571
So foolish of you, Lena.

01:21:58.573 --> 01:22:00.373
And when nobody's
watching, he's not so

01:22:00.375 --> 01:22:03.209
retarded anymore.

01:22:08.317 --> 01:22:10.517
You're planning to escape.

01:22:11.620 --> 01:22:13.386
No.

01:22:16.291 --> 01:22:18.491
I am pregnant, Lena.

01:22:18.493 --> 01:22:21.027
And I think they know.

01:22:21.029 --> 01:22:22.395
And he won't accept it.

01:22:22.397 --> 01:22:23.530
They'll kill it.

01:22:23.532 --> 01:22:26.099
And probably me, too.

01:22:26.101 --> 01:22:28.368
But the father?

01:22:28.370 --> 01:22:30.403
He's not from here.

01:22:30.405 --> 01:22:33.173
He was taken here,
just like your Hans.

01:22:33.175 --> 01:22:36.176
And I took care of
him at the hospital.

01:22:36.178 --> 01:22:37.711
Where is he now?

01:22:39.014 --> 01:22:40.580
He's nowhere.

01:22:40.582 --> 01:22:42.649
Didn't make it.

01:22:53.395 --> 01:22:55.695
That potato you're holding,
it's the same one

01:22:55.697 --> 01:22:57.330
you had when I left.

01:22:57.332 --> 01:22:59.466
Take your things, go
and sit back there.

01:22:59.468 --> 01:23:02.569
You'll only
gossip otherwise.

01:23:19.388 --> 01:23:21.454
Lena?

01:23:30.365 --> 01:23:33.133
It's always the same,
always the brainy ones.

01:23:33.135 --> 01:23:34.601
Where did you
get this from?

01:23:34.603 --> 01:23:35.635
I found it.

01:23:35.637 --> 01:23:37.437
Really, just like that?

01:23:39.107 --> 01:23:41.141
I'll find out, even if I
have to carve it out of

01:23:41.143 --> 01:23:45.345
flesh with a blunt fork,
so where did you get it from?

01:23:45.347 --> 01:23:46.312
I found it.

01:23:46.314 --> 01:23:47.781
Where did you get it from?

01:23:49.351 --> 01:23:50.817
Get out!

01:23:52.487 --> 01:23:53.553
Get out!

01:23:53.555 --> 01:23:56.256
I-I had it.

01:23:59.795 --> 01:24:01.628
You said what?

01:24:03.065 --> 01:24:05.231
This picture, Hans,
belongs to you?

01:24:05.233 --> 01:24:06.266
Uh-huh.

01:24:07.803 --> 01:24:10.437
Where did you get it from?

01:24:10.439 --> 01:24:14.074
If I tell you, Uncle
Bernd is gonna hit me.

01:24:18.513 --> 01:24:21.381
No, Uncle Bernd
won't hit you.

01:24:30.826 --> 01:24:32.325
Hans.

01:24:32.694 --> 01:24:35.462
In, in there.

01:24:36.098 --> 01:24:37.864
Open up the darkroom.

01:24:49.711 --> 01:24:52.412
The red, red book.

01:24:53.115 --> 01:24:54.647
Red book.

01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:06.226
I didn't take these.

01:25:06.228 --> 01:25:08.461
I'm impressed, Bernd.

01:25:09.197 --> 01:25:10.463
These are great.

01:25:10.465 --> 01:25:14.134
It wasn't me, Pius,
please, I...

01:25:15.737 --> 01:25:17.904
Don't worry.

01:25:18.607 --> 01:25:20.673
The truth will
set you free.

01:25:20.675 --> 01:25:22.642
Goldilocks can go now.

01:25:22.644 --> 01:25:26.346
We're going to have a chat
with our good brother Bernd.

01:25:27.682 --> 01:25:30.817
Well, get out,
both of you sluts!

01:26:04.719 --> 01:26:06.219
Lena?

01:26:09.224 --> 01:26:10.390
Lena!

01:26:22.938 --> 01:26:24.604
We'll go through the
workshop. It's quicker.

01:26:24.606 --> 01:26:26.439
We're taking Ursel with us,
she's in the potato shed.

01:26:26.441 --> 01:26:27.473
Are you insane?

01:26:27.475 --> 01:26:28.541
That's too far.

01:26:28.543 --> 01:26:30.243
I'm not going
without Ursel.

01:26:32.547 --> 01:26:33.479
Oh shit.

01:26:33.481 --> 01:26:34.747
Let's go!

01:26:36.718 --> 01:26:37.717
Go! Go! Go!

01:26:37.719 --> 01:26:39.552
Come on! Come on!

01:26:39.988 --> 01:26:43.690
Urgently searching for
brother Hans and sister Lena.

01:26:43.692 --> 01:26:46.492
They need to be
found immediately.

01:26:48.863 --> 01:26:50.747
What's going on?

01:26:50.748 --> 01:26:52.632
We're getting out of
here, and you are, too.

01:26:59.808 --> 01:27:00.940
Come on!

01:27:01.509 --> 01:27:03.409
Move it! Move!

01:27:03.411 --> 01:27:04.611
Come on!

01:27:33.908 --> 01:27:35.808
What is this?

01:27:35.810 --> 01:27:37.410
You didn't know?

01:27:37.412 --> 01:27:38.412
No.

01:27:40.015 --> 01:27:41.447
Hurry up!

01:27:43.018 --> 01:27:43.950
Take me to Hans's room.

01:27:43.952 --> 01:27:45.551
Come on! Get in!

01:28:00.335 --> 01:28:01.968
What do we do?

01:28:20.722 --> 01:28:22.055
It's only a few meters.

01:28:22.057 --> 01:28:23.956
And there's light
on the other side.

01:28:23.958 --> 01:28:24.824
I can't do it.

01:28:24.826 --> 01:28:26.492
You wanna go back?

01:28:27.462 --> 01:28:28.695
No.

01:28:34.602 --> 01:28:35.868
Is that Hans's bed?

01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:37.003
Yes.

01:28:57.058 --> 01:28:58.524
You go.

01:28:58.526 --> 01:28:59.559
You go first.

01:28:59.561 --> 01:29:00.626
Go.

01:29:07.035 --> 01:29:09.702
That goddamn fucking liar.

01:29:16.411 --> 01:29:17.477
Go.

01:29:48.943 --> 01:29:50.410
Ursel?

01:29:52.947 --> 01:29:53.947
Ursel?

01:30:27.982 --> 01:30:29.015
Ursel?

01:30:33.888 --> 01:30:34.987
Wait!

01:31:18.533 --> 01:31:19.732
We made it.

01:31:30.845 --> 01:31:31.944
Come on.

01:31:39.587 --> 01:31:43.523
Your brother Hans and your
sisters, Ursel and Lena,

01:31:43.525 --> 01:31:48.828
have lost their way and have
forsaken our good Lord.

01:31:48.830 --> 01:31:53.199
Pray for them so they find their
way home where they belong.

01:31:53.201 --> 01:31:55.167
I'm outside.

01:31:55.169 --> 01:31:56.836
Yes.

01:31:59.941 --> 01:32:01.574
Thank you.

01:32:02.944 --> 01:32:03.944
Thank you.

01:32:08.216 --> 01:32:09.048
Let's go.

01:32:09.050 --> 01:32:10.650
Yes, let's go.

01:32:20.728 --> 01:32:21.661
No!

01:32:21.663 --> 01:32:23.195
Stay, stay!

01:32:24.832 --> 01:32:25.832
Stay!

01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:47.086
Lena, let's go.

01:32:47.655 --> 01:32:48.754
They'll be here
any second.

01:32:48.756 --> 01:32:50.189
Come on, Lena!

01:32:50.191 --> 01:32:50.923
Come.

01:32:50.925 --> 01:32:52.358
No!

01:33:10.144 --> 01:33:10.977
Hey!

01:33:10.979 --> 01:33:12.812
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:33:39.140 --> 01:33:40.806
It's okay now.

01:33:41.976 --> 01:33:43.643
We're safe.

01:33:47.181 --> 01:33:48.347
Yeah.

01:33:49.684 --> 01:33:51.183
We're safe.

01:33:55.390 --> 01:33:57.790
You know, she
was pregnant.

01:34:03.064 --> 01:34:05.731
If I hadn't made her come,
she'd still be alive.

01:34:06.834 --> 01:34:08.868
It wasn't your fault.

01:34:08.870 --> 01:34:11.070
- No?
- No.

01:34:18.046 --> 01:34:19.412
I'm sorry.

01:35:05.326 --> 01:35:07.093
The ambassador is
ready to see you now.

01:35:07.095 --> 01:35:08.494
Would you follow me?

01:35:12.333 --> 01:35:13.933
This way, please.

01:35:19.173 --> 01:35:21.173
These are the
pictures I took.

01:35:36.090 --> 01:35:37.123
Good work.

01:35:38.793 --> 01:35:40.526
Thank you.

01:35:40.528 --> 01:35:41.494
Passports.

01:35:41.496 --> 01:35:43.195
Hot off the press.

01:35:43.197 --> 01:35:46.365
And this should fit,
uh, more or less.

01:35:46.367 --> 01:35:48.167
But I'm afraid there are
no more seats on today's

01:35:48.169 --> 01:35:50.002
flight, so I reserved
for the next one.

01:35:50.004 --> 01:35:51.237
What?

01:35:51.239 --> 01:35:52.972
In a week's time?

01:35:52.974 --> 01:35:54.140
I'm sorry, yes.

01:35:54.142 --> 01:35:56.375
We can't wait
for another week.

01:35:56.978 --> 01:35:58.511
What day is it today?

01:35:58.513 --> 01:36:00.279
Wednesday.

01:36:01.215 --> 01:36:03.115
We have a fifty-fifty chance.

01:36:03.117 --> 01:36:04.450
Hello?

01:36:05.253 --> 01:36:07.086
Is this the Ritz?

01:36:07.088 --> 01:36:09.288
Could you put me through
to one of your guests?

01:36:09.290 --> 01:36:11.390
Roman Breuer.

01:36:11.392 --> 01:36:13.492
B, R...

01:36:13.494 --> 01:36:15.127
Thank you.

01:36:15.129 --> 01:36:16.529
Roman?

01:36:16.531 --> 01:36:18.030
It's Lena.

01:36:18.032 --> 01:36:20.266
It's so good to
hear your voice.

01:36:20.268 --> 01:36:24.937
Tell me, are you by any
chance flying today?

01:36:28.276 --> 01:36:29.692
Oh my God.

01:36:29.693 --> 01:36:31.109
They've got themselves two
seats on the today's flight.

01:36:31.112 --> 01:36:33.979
Yes, they're leaving for
the airport just now.

01:36:34.882 --> 01:36:37.883
The Colonia Dignidad is
very powerful here in Chile.

01:36:37.885 --> 01:36:39.385
They're probably already
at the airport to make

01:36:39.387 --> 01:36:40.886
sure you won't
leave the country.

01:36:40.888 --> 01:36:42.388
I will personally
take you there.

01:36:42.390 --> 01:36:45.191
With my diplomatic status
I'll get you through

01:36:45.193 --> 01:36:47.960
border control,
so you'll be safe.

01:36:48.930 --> 01:36:49.995
The photos?

01:36:49.997 --> 01:36:51.430
You've got them?

01:36:51.432 --> 01:36:53.299
Shit.

01:36:55.369 --> 01:36:56.969
Just a minute.

01:37:03.477 --> 01:37:05.077
What are you doing?

01:37:16.991 --> 01:37:18.023
What was that?

01:37:18.025 --> 01:37:19.792
Oh, nothing really.

01:37:19.793 --> 01:37:21.560
We, ah, just forgot
the photographs.

01:37:21.562 --> 01:37:25.231
And we need them, because
we're going to nail these guys.

01:37:49.223 --> 01:37:50.623
Why aren't we getting out?

01:37:50.625 --> 01:37:51.991
You're safe here.

01:37:51.993 --> 01:37:53.960
Where are we going?

01:37:53.961 --> 01:37:56.161
To an underground entrance
so you won't be seen.

01:37:56.664 --> 01:37:58.330
Relax.

01:38:10.645 --> 01:38:12.611
It may not be the most
comfortable place,

01:38:12.613 --> 01:38:14.914
but it's absolutely safe.

01:38:18.619 --> 01:38:21.287
I'll pick you up as
soon boarding begins.

01:38:22.623 --> 01:38:24.056
Boarding card, please.

01:38:24.058 --> 01:38:26.125
Welcome aboard, sir.

01:38:27.428 --> 01:38:28.494
Lauren!

01:38:28.496 --> 01:38:29.528
Yes, Captain?

01:38:29.530 --> 01:38:31.063
Is Lena here?

01:38:31.065 --> 01:38:32.631
Haven't seen her.

01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:34.233
Could you check with
the gate, please?

01:38:34.235 --> 01:38:35.235
Sure.

01:38:35.670 --> 01:38:37.336
Where is this guy?

01:38:37.338 --> 01:38:38.170
Window heat.

01:38:38.172 --> 01:38:39.204
High.

01:38:40.241 --> 01:38:42.081
We should be
boarding by now.

01:38:42.476 --> 01:38:43.943
Lena hasn't checked in.

01:38:43.945 --> 01:38:44.476
Are you sure?

01:38:44.478 --> 01:38:46.078
Yes.

01:38:58.092 --> 01:38:59.525
Daniel!

01:39:02.229 --> 01:39:03.495
Fuck!

01:39:15.710 --> 01:39:16.675
Thank you for doing this.

01:39:16.677 --> 01:39:18.110
Sure.

01:39:25.419 --> 01:39:27.086
Shit.

01:39:42.203 --> 01:39:43.919
They must not reach the plane.

01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:45.636
This is the last and final
boarding announcement for

01:39:45.639 --> 01:39:48.173
Lufthansa 723
to Frankfurt.

01:39:48.175 --> 01:39:51.310
Will missing passengers
Daniel List and Lena

01:39:51.312 --> 01:39:54.613
Kortus please proceed to the
departure gate immediately.

01:39:54.615 --> 01:39:56.148
We are closing
the flight now.

01:39:56.150 --> 01:39:57.649
That's where
we need to go.

01:40:20.574 --> 01:40:21.507
No, no, the other way.

01:40:21.509 --> 01:40:22.808
Okay, go, go!

01:40:28.582 --> 01:40:30.816
Ladies and gentlemen, on
behalf of Captain Roman

01:40:30.818 --> 01:40:33.285
Breuer and the entire
crew, I want to welcome

01:40:33.287 --> 01:40:37.790
you on board this Boeing 707 on
a direct service to Frankfurt.

01:40:37.792 --> 01:40:39.324
Please stow away your...

01:40:47.668 --> 01:40:48.567
Boarding completed.

01:40:48.569 --> 01:40:50.202
Request to start up.

01:40:50.204 --> 01:40:52.171
Thank you, Lufthansa 723.

01:40:52.173 --> 01:40:53.105
Start-up approved.

01:40:53.107 --> 01:40:54.540
Report. Ready to taxi.

01:40:54.542 --> 01:40:56.408
Runway one seven.

01:40:56.410 --> 01:40:58.343
Taxi to runway one seven.

01:41:09.824 --> 01:41:11.090
Ready for take off.

01:41:14.462 --> 01:41:15.694
- Clear on your right.
- Clear on your...

01:41:15.696 --> 01:41:16.795
Hey!

01:41:16.797 --> 01:41:18.630
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:41:20.234 --> 01:41:21.300
Open the doors!

01:41:21.302 --> 01:41:22.302
Open the door!

01:41:27.541 --> 01:41:28.607
Lena, quick!

01:41:48.129 --> 01:41:50.229
You have to
instruct the tower.

01:41:53.467 --> 01:41:55.434
The Lufthansa plane 723.

01:41:55.436 --> 01:41:56.635
Stop it!

01:41:56.637 --> 01:41:58.904
Stop it!
Do you hear me?

01:41:59.874 --> 01:42:01.507
I owe you.

01:42:03.677 --> 01:42:05.377
Oh, yes.

01:42:09.583 --> 01:42:12.584
Lufthansa 723,
do you copy?

01:42:12.586 --> 01:42:15.354
Lufthansa 723,
go ahead.

01:42:15.356 --> 01:42:17.556
Flight permit
is canceled.

01:42:17.558 --> 01:42:19.358
Clearance is void.

01:42:21.495 --> 01:42:24.730
Please confirm, Lufthansa 723.
Flight permit is canceled.

01:42:24.732 --> 01:42:26.365
Lena!

01:42:28.869 --> 01:42:30.536
They've canceled
our clearance.

01:42:30.538 --> 01:42:32.171
What?

01:42:32.172 --> 01:42:33.805
Lufthansa 723,
do you read?

01:42:33.807 --> 01:42:35.274
Clearance is void.

01:42:35.276 --> 01:42:36.708
Please confirm.

01:42:40.347 --> 01:42:41.947
I can't do that.

01:42:41.949 --> 01:42:43.182
You have to, Roman.

01:42:44.218 --> 01:42:45.584
This is the police.

01:42:45.586 --> 01:42:47.753
Open the doors.

01:42:48.789 --> 01:42:49.588
Go! Go!

01:42:49.590 --> 01:42:50.956
- Roman?
- Please.

01:42:50.958 --> 01:42:54.560
Lufthansa 723, you
have no clearance.

01:42:54.562 --> 01:42:56.862
I repeat: You
have no clearance.

01:42:56.864 --> 01:42:57.796
Open the doors.

01:42:57.798 --> 01:42:59.631
Fuck it!

01:42:59.633 --> 01:43:02.734
Cabin crew, prepare
for take-off!

01:43:13.948 --> 01:43:16.415
What the fuck
are they doing?

01:43:41.842 --> 01:43:42.941
Ready for take-off.

01:43:42.943 --> 01:43:44.643
Ready for take-off.
