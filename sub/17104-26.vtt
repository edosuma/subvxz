00:02.839 --> 00:04.599
TARA (VOICEOVER): Previously
on "Dance Academy."

00:04.639 --> 00:07.160
-My dad thought I was the
best it was barely acceptable.

00:07.200 --> 00:09.160
Now, he knows I'm the worst.

00:09.199 --> 00:10.480
He was never gonna come, was he?

00:10.519 --> 00:12.519
-He was absolutely gonna try.

00:12.560 --> 00:14.800
-I think I like you.

00:14.839 --> 00:16.600
It's not true.

00:16.640 --> 00:17.839
I know I like you.

00:17.879 --> 00:21.079
-You're not ditching me
because you're confused.

00:21.120 --> 00:21.760
-OK.

00:21.800 --> 00:22.800
-I have to go.

00:22.839 --> 00:24.600
There's someone at the door.

00:24.640 --> 00:25.519
MYLES: Come with me.

00:25.559 --> 00:26.399
KAT: I can't.

00:26.440 --> 00:27.519
MYLES: Why not?

00:27.559 --> 00:28.800
-You'll be understudying Clara.

00:28.839 --> 00:30.640
You should be very
proud of your audition.

00:30.679 --> 00:32.399
You argued for Tara
in the audition,

00:32.439 --> 00:34.840
and I saw enough potential
to give her a chance.

00:34.880 --> 00:36.399
But she's struggling.

00:36.439 --> 00:39.240
Abigail, you take over Tara's
part for this rehearsal,

00:39.280 --> 00:40.679
please.

00:40.719 --> 00:41.399
Good, Abigail.

00:51.240 --> 00:57.359
THEME SONG: Whoa-oh,
whoa, whoa-oh.

00:57.399 --> 01:00.320
Take a breath.

01:00.359 --> 01:04.200
Close your eyes.

01:04.239 --> 01:07.159
Take a leap of faith
and lead the way

01:07.200 --> 01:12.120
tonight, tonight, tonight.

01:12.159 --> 01:16.079
This is my chance,
this is my chance,

01:16.120 --> 01:20.040
my chance to fell alive.

01:20.079 --> 01:24.519
Whoa-oh, whoa, whoa-oh.

01:34.439 --> 01:36.799
TARA (VOICEOVER): At home,
we have a billion stars,

01:36.840 --> 01:39.200
so many I've always
believed in magic.

01:39.239 --> 01:41.200
SEBASTIAN: It's no secret
that Clara's rehearsals

01:41.239 --> 01:43.560
have been a bit hit-and-miss.

01:43.599 --> 01:46.400
I'm hoping that changes now
that we're in the theater.

01:46.439 --> 01:48.359
TARA (VOICEOVER): Not
wizards and sorcerers.

01:48.400 --> 01:52.280
My magic is the kind of
four-leaf clovers and star

01:52.319 --> 01:52.799
signs.

01:52.840 --> 01:54.400
-Oh, wait.

01:54.439 --> 01:58.599
Come on, T. This is you.

01:58.640 --> 02:01.400
TARA (VOICEOVER): And that
in another life, I could fly.

02:05.640 --> 02:07.680
-This is not all for me.

02:07.719 --> 02:08.520
-You and--

02:08.560 --> 02:10.439
-That's my mirror.

02:10.479 --> 02:13.599
TARA (VOICEOVER): It used to
be so easy to believe in magic.

02:13.639 --> 02:17.599
These days, I'm just struggling
to believe in myself.

02:17.639 --> 02:20.280
-Tara, I'm not going
to sugarcoat it.

02:20.319 --> 02:22.599
But the understudy's
run-throughs

02:22.639 --> 02:24.240
have been more consistent.

02:24.280 --> 02:26.400
I will not be making a
decision until after the dress

02:26.439 --> 02:29.439
rehearsal, but I want you to
both be prepared for the fact

02:29.479 --> 02:31.240
that I may be
switching the roles.

02:44.639 --> 02:47.400
[phone beeping]

02:47.439 --> 02:52.599
--[sigh] Someone's told my dad
that our exam results come out

02:52.639 --> 02:55.360
tomorrow, and he wants to
discuss my five-year plan,

02:55.400 --> 02:56.520
like--

02:56.560 --> 02:59.080
-I was thinking this
could be a good chance

02:59.120 --> 03:01.759
to get to know other
guys in other years.

03:01.800 --> 03:03.319
-Why?

03:03.360 --> 03:04.800
CHRISTIAN: I don't know I
guess you could figure out

03:04.840 --> 03:07.599
if you're--

03:07.639 --> 03:10.400
-I know.

03:10.439 --> 03:11.080
-He's fit.

03:14.520 --> 03:16.800
SAMMY: Mate.

03:16.840 --> 03:19.080
-Too soon.

03:19.120 --> 03:20.280
-Just a little bit.

03:20.319 --> 03:20.639
-Sorry.

03:24.560 --> 03:25.840
-This is big theater, Tara.

03:25.879 --> 03:28.120
I need you to tell the
story with your whole body.

03:31.319 --> 03:33.639
No, I didn't mean smile more.

03:33.680 --> 03:37.639
This is not an Eisteddfod.

03:37.680 --> 03:40.400
Better.

03:40.439 --> 03:42.400
When are you getting
the costume for this?

03:42.439 --> 03:43.599
-Um, this afternoon.

03:43.639 --> 03:44.439
SEBASTIAN: Sustain.

03:50.400 --> 03:52.759
I don't understand why
Act One goes so well,

03:52.800 --> 03:54.280
and then you get to the solo.

03:58.439 --> 03:58.840
All right.

03:58.879 --> 04:01.599
That's it.

04:01.639 --> 04:04.680
We'll have to come back to this.

04:04.719 --> 04:05.800
Moving ahead to snowflakes.

04:11.479 --> 04:13.680
-She takes a while to process,
but when she gets it--

04:13.719 --> 04:16.560
-If you're directing this,
would that still be your call?

04:33.439 --> 04:35.720
Excellent.

04:35.759 --> 04:39.839
Abigail is the safer option--
technically proficient,

04:39.879 --> 04:52.199
a little cold,
but-- Clara is meant

04:52.240 --> 04:54.120
to be weaving her way
through the snowflakes,

04:54.160 --> 04:55.399
not crashing into them.

05:04.160 --> 05:07.720
-Tara may be a risk, but when
she gets it, there'll be magic.

05:07.759 --> 05:08.360
Promise.

05:18.199 --> 05:19.079
KAT: Yup.

05:19.120 --> 05:20.319
No, the parents are fine.

05:20.360 --> 05:21.759
But then ever since I
got too old for daycare,

05:21.800 --> 05:24.240
they haven't known what to
do with me over the holidays.

05:24.279 --> 05:25.240
-Is that Myles?

05:25.279 --> 05:26.560
-I'll call you back.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.720
-Looking forward to
meeting this young man.

05:28.759 --> 05:29.759
-Um, hi, Dad.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.480
Sorry, are we talking?

05:31.519 --> 05:33.079
-Sweetheart, we're
always talking.

05:33.120 --> 05:35.600
-Well, me-- walking
out of the audition,

05:35.639 --> 05:37.240
you-- instant coronary.

05:37.279 --> 05:38.480
Dad, if there's
been a ceasefire,

05:38.519 --> 05:40.399
nobody's shown me
the white flag.

05:40.439 --> 05:42.399
-I'm just giving you space
to do your own thing.

05:42.439 --> 05:44.279
It's what you've
always wanted, right?

05:44.319 --> 05:46.360
Let me take that.

05:49.759 --> 05:52.160
KAT: Uh, T, uh can you
pick a dress that you like

05:52.199 --> 05:54.319
and take it down to
wardrobe for alterations?

05:54.360 --> 05:55.800
-OK.

05:55.839 --> 05:57.120
-I took the newest.

05:57.160 --> 05:58.600
Dust doesn't work
with my allergies.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.720
Imagine if your parents
drive all this way,

06:02.759 --> 06:05.759
and you're not even
dancing anything.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.279
Ouch!

06:07.319 --> 06:09.360
I'm just saying.

06:09.399 --> 06:12.439
They'd have to make you a
party guest or a flower.

06:19.720 --> 06:21.600
KAT: Wow.

06:21.639 --> 06:24.399
That is weirdly perfect.

06:24.439 --> 06:27.199
I-- I don't think it needs
to be altered at all.

06:27.240 --> 06:28.759
MISS RAINE: Girls,
I have some notes.

06:28.800 --> 06:29.480
Tara?

06:29.519 --> 06:29.759
TARA: Yeah?

06:32.800 --> 06:35.240
-Oh, sorry.

06:35.279 --> 06:38.399
I haven't seen that
costume in a long time.

06:38.439 --> 06:40.279
-Oh, it's an ancient.

06:40.319 --> 06:43.639
My mom wore it,
and Olga Baranski,

06:43.680 --> 06:45.399
and Dame Josie Dorrin.

06:45.439 --> 06:49.639
MISS RAINE: Yes, it came out
with the Ballet Russes, 1936.

06:49.680 --> 06:54.199
Superstition says it's never
had so much as a broken thread.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.040
Take good care of it.

06:59.680 --> 07:00.399
-It's gorgeous.

07:03.879 --> 07:05.839
-[sigh]

07:21.560 --> 07:22.759
SEBASTIAN (VOICEOVER):
I need you

07:22.800 --> 07:25.120
to tell the story
with your whole body.

07:25.160 --> 07:27.079
[applause]

07:30.439 --> 07:34.560
[nutcracker music playing]

08:25.839 --> 08:29.800
[applause]

08:34.840 --> 08:37.799
-[sigh]

08:37.840 --> 08:38.440
-Hey.

08:41.080 --> 08:42.600
You going home at all tonight?

08:42.639 --> 08:45.080
-I just thought I should
try the solo with my costume

08:45.120 --> 08:48.279
on, see if it made a difference.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.279
-It did.

08:50.320 --> 08:51.799
-So how long were
you standing there?

08:51.840 --> 08:55.200
Um, did you see any strange?

08:55.240 --> 08:55.759
-Strange how?

08:58.440 --> 08:59.039
-Nevermind.

09:11.360 --> 09:14.159
[sigh] I can't believe
this year is almost over.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.360
-Yeah.

09:15.399 --> 09:17.399
I'm hoping Sammy's
dad gets off his back,

09:17.440 --> 09:19.000
or else holidays
at the Liebermans

09:19.039 --> 09:20.440
will be a little tense.

09:20.480 --> 09:24.360
-Well, if he doesn't, you
should so come stay at the farm.

09:24.399 --> 09:25.600
I'm serious.

09:25.639 --> 09:27.080
They always need the extra help.

09:27.120 --> 09:29.440
And Christmas lunch, we
have like 50 people over.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.320
So you wouldn't be in the way.

09:31.360 --> 09:33.080
-How do you have 50 people?

09:33.120 --> 09:35.360
-Cousins, second cousins.

09:35.399 --> 09:37.000
We all go swimming in the dam.

09:37.039 --> 09:40.240
I think you'd really love it.

09:40.279 --> 09:41.559
-Yeah.

09:41.600 --> 09:46.000
But then other stuff
would probably happen.

09:46.039 --> 09:48.159
-Is that-- I don't know,
is that a bad thing?

09:50.559 --> 09:55.519
-Tara, you and I don't really
have the best track record.

09:55.559 --> 09:57.159
I'm sorry, I just
don't think that--

09:57.200 --> 09:57.720
-No, you're right.

09:57.759 --> 09:58.519
Bad idea.

09:58.559 --> 09:59.639
Just forget I said anything.

10:06.159 --> 10:09.279
-Take that Anatomy, and stuff
it in your prosthetic fascia.

10:09.320 --> 10:10.639
Hm.

10:10.679 --> 10:13.200
-You know we do Anatomy in
second year as well, yeah?

10:17.399 --> 10:19.039
-Scholarship?

10:19.080 --> 10:19.639
-Part.

10:19.679 --> 10:20.320
Shared with--

10:20.360 --> 10:21.279
ABIGAIL: Mom?

10:21.320 --> 10:22.200
I got it.

10:22.240 --> 10:23.120
Yeah.

10:23.159 --> 10:25.360
And I topped everything.

10:25.399 --> 10:26.200
Yes, Hip Hop.

10:26.240 --> 10:28.600
I said everything.

10:28.639 --> 10:30.639
-Check out audition week.

10:30.679 --> 10:31.360
-Excuse me.

10:31.399 --> 10:32.600
Hi.

10:32.639 --> 10:34.159
Can you tell me where
the dressing room is.

10:34.200 --> 10:38.200
-Um, back the way you came
and second door to your left.

10:38.240 --> 10:40.799
-Is it amazing,
being at the Academy?

10:40.840 --> 10:42.679
-You have no idea.

10:42.720 --> 10:44.639
-Thank you.

10:44.679 --> 10:46.600
-Bye. [laughs]

10:46.639 --> 10:48.440
-Sh, sh.

10:48.480 --> 10:51.799
-High distinction,
high distinction.

10:51.840 --> 10:54.279
You're in top percentile
of every subject.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.679
-I know how I
place academically.

10:55.720 --> 10:59.360
But what about my,
uh-- my dance exams?

10:59.399 --> 11:02.039
-These are your
dance exams, Sammy.

11:02.080 --> 11:06.120
You should be really proud of
how far you've come this year.

11:06.159 --> 11:09.639
Which is why I was
disappointed to receive

11:09.679 --> 11:12.159
this email from your father.

11:12.200 --> 11:13.600
-Sorry?

11:13.639 --> 11:15.759
-It says he's withdrawing
his financial support.

11:24.039 --> 11:25.440
MAN (ON PA): Full
dress rehearsal.

11:25.480 --> 11:27.399
Act Two beginners to the stage.

11:27.440 --> 11:28.559
Act Two beginners.

11:28.600 --> 11:32.120
All technicians
prepare for the solo.

11:32.159 --> 11:33.720
CHRISTIAN: He doesn't
even want you here.

11:33.759 --> 11:35.639
Why is next year any different?

11:35.679 --> 11:38.759
-Because I'm in
grade 11 next year.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.720
The subjects you
choose, the school you

11:40.759 --> 11:45.200
go to, they all effect your
university entrance, Samuel.

11:45.240 --> 11:46.320
Mom.

11:46.360 --> 11:47.720
Yeah, could you
put me on to Dad?

11:47.759 --> 11:48.879
OK.

11:48.919 --> 11:50.159
OK, will you tell him
that my phone is on.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.480
If he wants to call me, he can.

11:51.519 --> 11:54.200
But he can't make
up his mind until he

11:54.240 --> 11:56.120
sees me dance tomorrow night.

11:56.159 --> 11:58.240
-So you and Myles got
any exciting plans

11:58.279 --> 11:59.360
for the holidays?

11:59.399 --> 12:01.759
-Um, why are we
talking about this now?

12:01.799 --> 12:04.759
-Because I'm trying
to distract myself.

12:04.799 --> 12:06.360
[nutcracker music playing]

12:06.399 --> 12:07.600
-Break a leg, Tara.

12:20.559 --> 12:23.480
-If after rehearsal
I decide to recast,

12:23.519 --> 12:25.360
I want you to be the
one to tell Tara.

12:30.600 --> 12:33.559
TARA: [gasp] I'm
keeping it, really?

12:33.600 --> 12:35.120
-I never doubted
it for a second.

12:35.159 --> 12:36.440
-It's-- it's this dress.

12:36.480 --> 12:37.679
It's like magic.

12:37.720 --> 12:40.240
When I'm wearing it,
nothing can go wrong.

12:40.279 --> 12:43.639
ETHAN: Listen, I've decided to
stick around Sydney for a bit.

12:43.679 --> 12:45.399
Dad's offered me a
job as his assistant,

12:45.440 --> 12:47.120
and there's some
stuff I can learn.

12:47.159 --> 12:48.720
TARA: Sounds smart.

12:48.759 --> 12:51.200
-You should stay with
us over the break.

12:51.240 --> 12:52.200
We can take [inaudible].

12:52.240 --> 12:53.519
You and Kat can hang out.

12:53.559 --> 12:55.120
You and I can hang out.

12:55.159 --> 12:56.759
Just think about it.

12:56.799 --> 12:58.240
-Uh, I don't-- I don't have to.

12:58.279 --> 12:59.679
I'm in.

12:59.720 --> 13:00.960
-Really?

13:01.000 --> 13:03.759
-Will I be able to change
any time this century?

13:03.799 --> 13:04.559
-All right.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.360
We'll talk details later.

13:11.240 --> 13:13.759
-I have a favor to ask.

13:13.799 --> 13:16.480
Tickets are sold out, and some
idiot put my parents together.

13:16.519 --> 13:18.200
I'm not sure if
you heard, but they

13:18.240 --> 13:20.240
won't come if they're
sitting next to each other.

13:20.279 --> 13:23.440
I was just wondering whether one
of yours might swap with mine.

13:23.480 --> 13:25.080
-Oh, um--

13:25.120 --> 13:26.080
-Forget it.

13:26.120 --> 13:27.240
-No, no, I can ask them.

13:27.279 --> 13:28.679
-It's fine.

13:28.720 --> 13:29.799
I'll sort something out.

13:35.320 --> 13:38.279
KAT: It's not much, just
a couple of presents.

13:38.320 --> 13:41.200
But it would be
awesome if you could

13:41.240 --> 13:43.639
play Santa at the right moment.

13:43.679 --> 13:46.360
-Why, are you're not
planning on being around?

13:46.399 --> 13:47.519
KAT: No, actually.

13:47.559 --> 13:49.200
Myles and I are
flying to Darwin,

13:49.240 --> 13:51.120
doing a road trip
around the country.

13:51.159 --> 13:52.639
-Oh, I hadn't heard.

13:52.679 --> 13:54.679
-It's not exactly for
public record yet,

13:54.720 --> 13:57.120
but I was planning on calling
Ethan from the airport,

13:57.159 --> 13:58.759
and then he could let
everyone know that--

13:58.799 --> 14:02.000
-You're running away.

14:02.039 --> 14:03.159
-Going away.

14:03.200 --> 14:07.080
-[sigh]

14:07.120 --> 14:08.559
-Wow.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.720
You were actually the one person
I thought would understand.

14:15.639 --> 14:17.320
Look, there's one
in there for you.

14:24.240 --> 14:26.399
SAMMY: So I'm stuck in
the Bermuda Love Triangle.

14:26.440 --> 14:29.279
Do you still like Ethan?

14:29.320 --> 14:30.000
-I don't know.

14:30.039 --> 14:32.000
Maybe.

14:32.039 --> 14:33.600
Kat, would it totally
ruin your holiday

14:33.639 --> 14:35.159
if I went out with your brother.

14:35.200 --> 14:35.919
-OK, stop.

14:35.960 --> 14:38.240
-Why, did you see a shark?

14:38.279 --> 14:39.720
-No, Sammy.

14:39.759 --> 14:41.559
Well, it's the end of the year.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.000
You guys are my
two best friends.

14:43.039 --> 14:45.600
Can we just be here
for a minute together?

14:59.759 --> 15:03.639
-Contemporary-- distinction.

15:03.679 --> 15:07.799
Pas de deux, high distinction.

15:07.840 --> 15:11.360
General comment-- Christian
lives up to his potential.

15:16.639 --> 15:22.000
I, um-- I just wanted
to say thanks, Mom,

15:22.039 --> 15:23.679
for making me audition.

15:37.799 --> 15:40.799
So anyway, there's,
um-- there's this girl.

15:57.799 --> 15:59.639
-May I help you?

15:59.679 --> 16:01.600
-Uh, I don't know.

16:01.639 --> 16:03.000
I'm doing work experience.

16:03.039 --> 16:04.440
I have to take costumes.

16:07.240 --> 16:08.159
OK.

16:08.200 --> 16:09.519
Those are for side
stage changes.

16:09.559 --> 16:11.639
And those are fine
to go into storage.

16:11.679 --> 16:15.519
-And that one?

16:15.559 --> 16:17.039
-Storage.

16:17.080 --> 16:17.360
-Thanks.

16:30.480 --> 16:34.440
SEBASTIAN (ON PA): Cast and
crew, 30 minutes 'til curtain.

16:34.480 --> 16:36.240
-Hey, I'll see you guys later.

16:36.279 --> 16:37.440
-OK.

16:37.480 --> 16:38.120
-Hey, Kat, you're sitting
with me out front?

16:38.159 --> 16:39.320
-Uh, no.

16:39.360 --> 16:41.159
I'm-- I'm going to stay
back here with costumes.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.159
-Sure, OK.

16:48.120 --> 16:51.759
-You're seriously leaving now?

16:51.799 --> 16:55.639
I finally worked out what
we both have in common.

16:55.679 --> 16:57.480
This is it for us.

16:57.519 --> 17:00.240
These guys are our family.

17:00.279 --> 17:01.600
So quit dancing.

17:01.639 --> 17:02.639
Blow off your parents.

17:02.679 --> 17:03.799
But at least say goodbye.

17:06.519 --> 17:07.440
-I can't.

17:07.480 --> 17:10.559
They'll try to stop me.

17:10.598 --> 17:13.759
[phone ringing]

17:13.799 --> 17:15.598
Hey, Myles.

17:15.640 --> 17:17.598
Yeah, I'm on my way now.

17:17.640 --> 17:18.240
Yeah.

17:18.279 --> 17:18.759
Bye.

17:25.559 --> 17:27.319
-Open.

17:27.358 --> 17:29.640
-Oh, Abigail, I fixed up the
tickets, and you're mom's

17:29.680 --> 17:30.519
sitting with mine.

17:30.559 --> 17:31.160
-Close.

17:34.839 --> 17:36.480
-Miss Raine, when
you danced Clara,

17:36.519 --> 17:39.319
what costume did you wear?

17:39.359 --> 17:41.640
-I never danced Clara.

17:41.680 --> 17:42.319
-Oh.

18:09.359 --> 18:11.319
-Is your dad a no-show?

18:14.599 --> 18:16.000
Yeah, well mine
hasn't spoken to me

18:16.039 --> 18:19.200
since he found out I
had a boyfriend, so.

18:19.240 --> 18:19.559
-Really?

18:23.240 --> 18:24.079
-Hey.

18:24.119 --> 18:25.359
Hey, let's do this.

18:34.799 --> 18:35.799
-Is that it?

18:35.839 --> 18:36.640
-Yup, that's it.

19:00.559 --> 19:01.480
-Sorry, Sebastian?

19:01.519 --> 19:02.759
SEBASTIAN: Yes?

19:02.799 --> 19:05.559
-I was just hanging my
Clara costume side stage.

19:05.599 --> 19:07.680
Obviously, nothing's
gonna happen to Tara.

19:07.720 --> 19:10.680
Anyway, I noticed her nightgown
doesn't seem to be there.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.079
I'm sure it's fine.

19:12.119 --> 19:13.279
I just thought I'd
better mention something.

19:13.319 --> 19:14.559
-What's happening, Abigail?

19:14.599 --> 19:15.759
SEBASTIAN: Thank you, Abigail.

19:15.799 --> 19:17.559
-Ethan will check that out.

19:17.599 --> 19:18.240
ETHAN: Sure.

19:35.160 --> 19:37.359
-Well, that was was fun.

19:40.640 --> 19:41.519
What?

19:41.559 --> 19:42.680
-What did you do with it?

19:42.720 --> 19:44.039
-Hey, back off, OK?

19:44.079 --> 19:45.039
It's just been mispaced.

19:45.079 --> 19:45.720
-All right.

19:45.759 --> 19:47.119
Wardrobe gave me these.

19:47.160 --> 19:49.440
-No, Tara's had a blue sash.

19:49.480 --> 19:50.279
Yeah.

19:50.319 --> 19:51.720
No, everything's under control.

19:51.759 --> 19:52.720
Look, Tara, you're just gonna
have to wear one of these,

19:52.759 --> 19:53.480
or Abigail's.

19:53.519 --> 19:54.440
TARA: I can't.

19:54.480 --> 19:55.400
ETHAN: It's just a costume.

19:55.440 --> 19:56.200
-No, it's not.

19:56.240 --> 19:57.480
It'll be like in rehearsal.

19:57.519 --> 20:00.119
I never got through this
act without the costume.

20:00.160 --> 20:01.519
Abigail will have to go on.

20:01.559 --> 20:02.720
-Well, I can't have a different
Clara halfway through.

20:02.759 --> 20:04.400
CHRISTIAN: All right, Tara.

20:04.440 --> 20:05.359
What do you need.

20:05.400 --> 20:06.039
TARA: Kat.

20:06.079 --> 20:07.200
I need to talk to Kat.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.400
ETHAN: OK.

20:08.440 --> 20:09.519
Will someone find-- Can
someone find my sister?

20:12.119 --> 20:13.359
KAT: Wait, whoa, whoa.

20:13.400 --> 20:14.480
Slow down.

20:14.519 --> 20:17.000
-It's gone, and I
can't dance without it.

20:17.039 --> 20:18.319
I'll make a fool of myself.

20:18.359 --> 20:19.160
ETHAN: All right.

20:19.200 --> 20:20.079
Abigail, start getting dressed.

20:20.119 --> 20:21.480
KAT (ON PHONE): OK, no.

20:21.519 --> 20:23.119
Listen, you're an expert at
making a fool of yourself.

20:23.160 --> 20:24.319
TARA: Where are you?

20:24.359 --> 20:25.519
KAT (ON PHONE): That
doesn't matter, OK.

20:25.559 --> 20:28.039
What does is that you
stop making excuses.

20:28.079 --> 20:29.759
Look, I get that
you're scared, T.

20:29.799 --> 20:31.319
But you need to
stuck it up and do

20:31.359 --> 20:33.599
what it is that you've been
working for this whole year.

20:33.640 --> 20:36.519
ABIGAIL: Kat's right.

20:36.559 --> 20:39.119
You're gonna have to
go on, because I'm not.

20:41.559 --> 20:45.720

better at this than me,

20:45.759 --> 20:49.559

20:49.599 --> 20:51.400

21:09.400 --> 21:12.319
-Babe, do they even
know you're going?

21:12.359 --> 21:16.359
Listen, I don't care if
we miss this plane, if we

21:16.400 --> 21:18.680
miss the next one, or
we don't go at all.

21:18.720 --> 21:19.559
All right?

21:19.599 --> 21:21.720
All I care about is you.

21:29.039 --> 21:30.599
-Why are they
holding the curtain?

21:30.640 --> 21:31.559
-Wardrobe issue.

21:31.599 --> 21:33.640
-But I think I'm ready now.

21:33.680 --> 21:35.240
-I know you are.

21:41.519 --> 21:42.480
-OK, wait.

21:42.519 --> 21:43.440
Wait, wait.

21:43.480 --> 21:45.519
Can you read that
for me, please?

21:55.559 --> 21:57.519
-You didn't make it
into second year.

22:06.359 --> 22:06.680
-OK.

22:09.359 --> 22:13.599
-So Christmas day-- are
your family seafood people

22:13.640 --> 22:14.359
or turkey?

22:14.400 --> 22:15.759
-What?

22:15.799 --> 22:18.079
-You know, I'd love to come
down to the farm with you,

22:18.119 --> 22:19.240
if that's still cool.

22:19.279 --> 22:20.720
-You have the worst
possible timing.

22:20.759 --> 22:22.200
-Sh.

I think you're about
to miss your entrance.

before, where gravity can't
touch me-- nothing can.

If I think about it, I can
feel the ache in my knee.

me, it's spurring me on.
