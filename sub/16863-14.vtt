00:01.140 --> 00:03.200
Previously on rescue me...

00:04.930 --> 00:07.265
- What are you doin'?
- You got the cancer.

00:07.300 --> 00:09.880
I came over to try to end it
for you before it turns ugly.

00:09.915 --> 00:11.360
- Now lay down.
- I-I don't care,teddy.

00:11.395 --> 00:12.575
I just-I really wanna live,ok?

00:12.610 --> 00:14.530
Can you-can you just put
the pillow down,please?

00:14.565 --> 00:16.320
He can drink all the booze he wants.

00:16.355 --> 00:17.805
Won't matter a bit.

00:17.840 --> 00:20.525
Ain't no tears inside of bottles.

00:20.560 --> 00:23.850
He cried 'em all when connor got crushed.

00:24.310 --> 00:26.595
Face the music,assholes.

00:26.630 --> 00:31.270
He's gone,dead as a
doornail inside,just like me.

00:31.305 --> 00:33.085
Only,he's still walking around.

00:33.120 --> 00:36.790
- You're being intimate wi-with
janet,wi-and sheila again? - Maybe I am.

00:36.825 --> 00:37.935
I am taking responsibility,

00:37.970 --> 00:41.360
and I'm paying for everything
and taking care of all the kids,

00:41.395 --> 00:44.750
and in return,I get basically
free sex with no strings attached.

00:44.785 --> 00:46.650
Bullshit.

00:47.330 --> 00:49.300
Let's go,frankie. Come on. Come on.

00:49.335 --> 00:50.897
I think frankie's ready.

00:50.932 --> 00:52.425
I think chuckie's dead.

00:52.460 --> 00:54.540
I think the thing with janet and my kids and

00:54.575 --> 00:55.972
then you and damien-I don't know.

00:56.007 --> 00:57.335
I mean,even though it's working good,

00:57.370 --> 00:59.645
maybe we're just kind of fooling ourselves.

00:59.680 --> 01:02.350
You have got to keep your eyes on the prize,

01:02.385 --> 01:05.019
- which,in this case,are the kids.
- Right.

01:05.055 --> 01:09.800
Colleen,katy,wyatt,damien,and...

01:09.835 --> 01:12.725
oh,yeah. These.

01:12.760 --> 01:15.200
The more that I thought about
you,the more I realized how-

01:15.235 --> 01:18.530
how attracted I was to
you from the beginning.

01:18.565 --> 01:22.780
I wanna take it slow. Ok?

01:23.840 --> 01:25.315
You wanna play chess?

01:25.350 --> 01:26.755
Can we do it in the nude?

01:26.790 --> 01:30.015
I come over,because I
wanna get back with colleen.

01:30.050 --> 01:31.990
That's the whole idea. That's
what I'm sayin' to you here.

01:32.025 --> 01:33.215
Colleen's impressed.

01:33.250 --> 01:36.860
If we have to play this game,then
let's do it right,so be cool.

01:36.895 --> 01:39.210
Cool is how I do,baby.

01:40.290 --> 01:41.485
Madre mia.

01:41.520 --> 01:43.540
Maybe I ought to buy you
a drink,see how that goes.

01:44.280 --> 01:45.435
That- that sounds good.

01:45.470 --> 01:47.505
Please don't stand here looking sad.

01:47.540 --> 01:51.500
It only stands to remind the
children just how sick they are.

01:51.535 --> 01:55.460
If you wanna come in,you have
to literally put on a happy face.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.074
Who's the old guy?

02:09.110 --> 02:11.725
Sonny volpe,former middleweight contender,

02:11.760 --> 02:14.305
currently the finest
cut man in the business.

02:14.340 --> 02:17.540
- The finest,huh?
- Well,the finest we could get.

02:18.170 --> 02:21.210
- How old is he,exactly?
- He is old. Fought in the olympics.

02:21.245 --> 02:23.030
- Which olympics?
- Put it to you this way.

02:23.065 --> 02:25.220
They were still wearin' sandals.

02:25.255 --> 02:27.645
That's old. That's old.

02:27.680 --> 02:29.865
Franco looks good,though.
He looks really focused.

02:29.900 --> 02:33.970
This whole channel-your-angst
method he's got is really workin'.

02:34.005 --> 02:35.815
Lookit,w-we're doin' the right
thing with the pretty boy.

02:35.850 --> 02:37.990
I mean,you know,he's
- we're gonna make money here,including him.

02:38.025 --> 02:39.895
Yes. You have no idea.

02:39.930 --> 02:41.910
If he wins tonight and we
play this the right way,

02:41.945 --> 02:43.345
it's a license to print money.

02:43.380 --> 02:46.540
- Cool.
- I'm gonna be the white don king.

02:46.980 --> 02:49.000
Well,without the hair...

02:50.300 --> 02:53.710
ho buggy,and the manslaughter charge.

02:55.810 --> 02:57.175
Don knotts?

02:57.210 --> 03:00.310
That's what I was thinkin'. See you later.

03:01.350 --> 03:04.560
- So how's it goin' with,uh,candy?
- Great.

03:07.150 --> 03:08.940
You close the deal?

03:18.890 --> 03:20.655
- God,I hate you so much.
- I'm sure you do.

03:20.690 --> 03:22.420
- What's the problem?
- There's no problem.

03:22.455 --> 03:24.037
Why would there be a problem?

03:24.072 --> 03:25.585
I- there's no problem,tommy.

03:25.620 --> 03:29.040
No,w-we're 2 mature people with
a deep respect for each other,

03:29.075 --> 03:31.967
and we've made a mutual decision
to just kind of go slow...

03:32.002 --> 03:34.825
Because we don't really know
wh-what's comin' down the pike,

03:34.860 --> 03:36.980
and you don't wanna just
- I don't know what the hell the problem is.

03:37.015 --> 03:37.985
Ok. I smell a rat.

03:38.020 --> 03:39.865
- There's no rat.
- There's gotta be a rat.

03:39.900 --> 03:42.630
- I'm tellin' you there's a rat. Based on what you're tellin' me,there's a rat,
- Why would there be a rat?

03:42.665 --> 03:43.745
and I think the rat is
hiding between her legs.

03:43.780 --> 03:45.210
- Hey,asshole,you crossed...
- Hey,don't call me an asshole!

03:45.245 --> 03:47.045
- The line that time!
- I'm tryin' to help you!

03:47.080 --> 03:48.760
- Take it outside,ladies! Take it outside!
- Excuse me,old man.

03:48.795 --> 03:50.860
- We're havin' a private conversation.
- Get outta here.

03:50.895 --> 03:54.660
Well,we can have it in the hallway.

03:57.770 --> 04:03.030
- Hey,where'd you-I think he's,uh,missin'
an eyeball. - He lost it in the war.

04:03.065 --> 04:04.475
- Korean?
- Trojan.

04:04.510 --> 04:07.800
Look,I don't want you ever,ever,ever
to talk about candy like that again.

04:07.835 --> 04:08.955
Do you hear me?

04:08.990 --> 04:11.540
Listen,I'm your friend. You
know what fr-friend means,ok?

04:11.575 --> 04:14.090
It's somebody who cares about
you a-and wants to help you,ok?

04:14.125 --> 04:15.960
And,you know,the last time
you got involved with her,

04:15.995 --> 04:17.295
you didn't let me in.

04:17.329 --> 04:19.190
- I'm tryin' to protect you.
- Well,you know what? Don't try to protect you.

04:19.225 --> 04:20.394
What are you tryin' to protect me from?

04:20.430 --> 04:22.285
From being careful? From being listened to?

04:22.320 --> 04:25.035
All right,this is the first slice of
true happiness I've had in 2 years,tom.

04:25.070 --> 04:28.590
Slice. Slice. Ok,may i remind you the last time you got
involved with that slice,she took every penny that you had?

04:28.625 --> 04:30.745
Hey,lou. He in there?

04:30.780 --> 04:32.880
Yeah,he's in there,but i wouldn't go in
there if I were you,because,uh-ok,see you.

04:32.915 --> 04:35.092
- Who's that? - Yeah,that's franco's friend.

04:35.127 --> 04:37.270
She needs to go all the way in there and...

04:37.305 --> 04:38.705
You saw how she's built.

04:38.740 --> 04:40.215
She can go wherever the hell she wants.

04:40.250 --> 04:42.850
Look,tom,I don't think you should
judge me on this candy thing,you know.

04:42.885 --> 04:44.522
I mean,I may be in over my head...

04:44.557 --> 04:46.160
- That's true. - But you are,too.

04:46.650 --> 04:48.065
Me? Ok.

04:48.100 --> 04:49.115
How-how do you think?

04:49.150 --> 04:52.005
Well,how's this whole
no-strings,uh,relationship thing goin'?

04:52.040 --> 04:53.710
You know what? Don't try to turn
the judgment thing around on me.

04:53.745 --> 04:56.470
The fact remains you are
involved with an ex-whore,

04:56.505 --> 04:57.870
ok,who-you know what you are to her?

04:57.905 --> 04:59.285
You're-you're a conduit.

04:59.320 --> 05:00.990
That's a-she's just waitin' for
your new paychecks to come in

05:01.025 --> 05:02.155
so she can bilk you up for- -

05:02.190 --> 05:05.200
And what are you? And what are you to
sheila and janet but a conduit to the kids?

05:05.235 --> 05:07.065
You're a bigger whore than candy ever was.

05:07.100 --> 05:09.070
- You're callin' me a whore?
- Yeah,I'm callin' you a whore.

05:09.105 --> 05:10.767
- Ok.
- You called me a conduit.

05:10.802 --> 05:12.395
You called me a conduit and a whore.

05:12.430 --> 05:13.995
- I want an apology.
- I want 2 apologies.

05:14.030 --> 05:16.570
- You're not ge-gonna get an apology,let
alone 2 apologies. - Unbelievable.

05:16.605 --> 05:20.380
- Rivera,you're up in 20.
- Get the hell outta here!

05:22.490 --> 05:24.420
- 2 apologies. I want 'em right now.
- It ain't gonna happen.

05:24.455 --> 05:27.175
Ok- Look,look,tommy,it's time for a truce.

05:27.210 --> 05:30.015
I'm not gonna say anything more
about your no-strings arrangement.

05:30.050 --> 05:33.230
All of a sudden,you're a polygamist,obviously
born and raised in utah...

05:33.265 --> 05:34.977
- Starting your own stuff-
- A-all right,enough.

05:35.012 --> 05:36.876
Not gonna say anything. Ok? Lips are sealed.

05:36.911 --> 05:38.800
You in exchange,just butt the hell out of

05:38.835 --> 05:40.655
whatever I got goin' on with candy,ok?

05:40.690 --> 05:44.605
Just let me enjoy the illusion for as
long as it lasts,tom. Can you do that?

05:44.640 --> 05:48.520
Ok,but you know what? When she
shatters your heart into a million tiny,

05:48.555 --> 05:50.235
- little pieces,don't come cryin' to me.
- I won'T.

05:50.270 --> 05:53.010
Ok,'cause I'm not gonna have some,like,little
magical dustpan,I can pick up all the pieces for you.

05:53.045 --> 05:54.540
- I don't need your magical dustpan.
- Ok. All right.

05:54.575 --> 05:55.725
I won't come to you,believe me.

05:55.760 --> 05:58.310
The last person I'm gonna come to is you.

05:58.345 --> 06:00.785
- Conduit. - Whore.

06:52.720 --> 06:53.775
Ah,finally.

06:53.810 --> 06:55.315
What took you so long,eh?

06:55.350 --> 06:56.785
What the hell? What?

06:56.820 --> 06:57.980
Line was around the block.

06:58.015 --> 06:59.495
- Thanks. Nice.

06:59.530 --> 07:02.090
Went to the ladies' room,and she
wasn't too happy about the wait either.

07:02.125 --> 07:05.170
What am I gonna do,man? The
cashier had brain damage.

07:07.170 --> 07:10.630
So how would you,uh,gauge
her level of displeasure?

07:10.665 --> 07:14.090
- What do you mean?
- Like from a scale of 1 to 10.

07:14.125 --> 07:15.085
I don't know if I can put a number on it.

07:15.120 --> 07:18.680
There was a lot of eye
rolling and a lot of-12.

07:18.715 --> 07:19.875
- Damn.
- It was a 12.

07:19.910 --> 07:22.950
- Did she curse me?
- Depends if you consider "douche bag" a curse word.

07:23.740 --> 07:25.765
Dependin' on if it's the right context,yeah.

07:25.800 --> 07:27.825
She said something like,"how
long is that little douche bag

07:27.860 --> 07:29.475
- gonna take to bring me my diet coke?"
- Yeah,I know. Wasn't good.

07:29.510 --> 07:33.570
- Oh,shit.
- You ever heard the expression "pussy hairs pull battleships?"

07:33.605 --> 07:35.477
What is that supposed to mean,chief?

07:35.512 --> 07:37.350
Just think about it for a minute.

07:37.890 --> 07:39.480
Oh,what,you're tryin'
to say I'm pussy-whipped?

07:39.515 --> 07:41.490
No,I said,"pussy hairs pull battleships. "

07:41.525 --> 07:43.007
How you interpret that is up to you.

07:43.042 --> 07:44.455
I'm not pussy-whipped,all right?

07:44.490 --> 07:46.360
Hey,who's the babe frank's talkin' with?

07:46.395 --> 07:48.105
Oh,that's,uh,franco's friend.

07:48.140 --> 07:49.715
Since when does frank have chick friends?

07:49.750 --> 07:51.840
Well,you know,he's tryin'
to get in her pants,but...

07:51.875 --> 07:53.535
Not a bad place to be,I imagine.

07:53.570 --> 07:55.370
You could rest a cocktail on that ass.

07:55.405 --> 07:56.605
Nice.

07:56.640 --> 07:59.330
You'd need mountain gears
to get up on top of that.

08:00.300 --> 08:04.110
What? You think elder statesmen such
as I don't think about things like this?

08:04.145 --> 08:07.920
I do have the biggest dick in the
department and have been known to use it.

08:10.470 --> 08:12.860
- Anybody want this?
- No,thanks.

08:14.820 --> 08:16.450
- Hey,guys.
- Carla,right?

08:16.790 --> 08:18.845
- Hey,what's up?
- Guys,this is carla.

08:18.880 --> 08:19.910
- How you doin'? - Carla. -
Carla,hey. - How you doin'?

08:19.945 --> 08:22.030
- Our guy ready for a tussle?
- Shit,yeah.

08:22.065 --> 08:24.780
He's gonna tear that bitch a new hole.

08:24.815 --> 08:26.595
Oh,look who decided to return.

08:26.630 --> 08:29.650
Hey,uh,col-this is my daughter colleen.

08:29.685 --> 08:31.167
This is franco's friend carla.

08:31.202 --> 08:32.615
- How you doin'?
- Carla,colleen.

08:32.650 --> 08:34.385
Uh,you know what? I'm
gonna go back to my seat.

08:34.419 --> 08:36.760
You know,the fight's about to
start,so,uh,see you guys later.

08:36.794 --> 08:38.852
- See you later.
- Bye.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.847
- See you.
- Nice girl,huh?

08:40.883 --> 08:42.809
She's- she's pretty hot.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.495
She's a total lesbo.

08:45.530 --> 08:47.665
What? I mean,come on,col.

08:47.700 --> 08:49.405
Just 'cause,like,she
talks like a dude and walks

08:49.440 --> 08:51.075
like a dude doesn't mean
she's a lesbo,all right?

08:51.110 --> 08:53.300
Come on. You can't say that
serena williams is a lesbo

08:53.335 --> 08:55.245
because she's athletic and built.

08:55.280 --> 08:57.555
Hey,um,first of all,serena
williams isn't a lesbo,

08:57.590 --> 08:59.830
because women are too
afraid to have sex with her.

08:59.865 --> 09:01.205
Not to mention guys.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.685
I mean,would any one of you guys do her?

09:03.720 --> 09:05.795
You're talkin' about serena
williams,the tennis player?

09:05.830 --> 09:08.360
The one who's big enough to be
a power forward for the knicks?

09:08.395 --> 09:09.885
That's the one.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.980
Oh,I wouldn't do her without
a buddy and a safety word.

09:12.015 --> 09:13.930
Yeah,well,her handshake was kinda painful.

09:13.965 --> 09:15.527
That's a secret lesbo handshake.

09:15.562 --> 09:17.090
There's a secret lesbo handshake?

09:18.020 --> 09:21.170
A girl that's straight and just
athletic is always very conscientious

09:21.205 --> 09:23.920
about shaking your hand
all delicate and ladylike,

09:23.955 --> 09:25.960
but a true lesbo doesn't
know how to do that.

09:25.995 --> 09:27.645
You know,it's not in her nature.

09:27.680 --> 09:29.960
Boo,why you know about all this shit?

09:32.210 --> 09:34.960
Ah,no,no. Please don't tell me.

09:35.460 --> 09:36.705
This isn't diet.

09:36.740 --> 09:39.540
- Tommy,did you know about-
- I asked you to get me a diet coke,shawn.

09:39.575 --> 09:40.725
You were a lesbo,boo?

09:40.760 --> 09:43.795
Hey,hey,please stop using the
term "boo" when I'm around.

09:43.830 --> 09:46.910
- I'm just sayin',come on,you guys
knew this- - This is a boo-free zone.

09:46.945 --> 09:50.305
Come on,shawn.

09:50.340 --> 09:52.875
Now,go get me my diet soda.

09:52.910 --> 09:55.990
You know what? You gavins,I don't
know what's wrong with y'all.

09:56.025 --> 09:57.695
You look great,champ.

09:57.730 --> 10:00.765
Now remember,there are innocent
children dyin' senseless deaths

10:00.800 --> 10:04.610
all over the world this very
moment,and garrity's got cancer. Use it.

10:04.645 --> 10:06.570
You stick and move. You
hear me? Stick and move.

10:06.605 --> 10:07.975
Do not bum-rush him.

10:08.010 --> 10:10.850
Shut up,you assholes. Shut up.

10:12.050 --> 10:14.610
Yo,bust his hole,franco!

10:14.645 --> 10:16.945
Need I say more?

10:16.980 --> 10:20.020
Stick and move. Stick and move.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.580
- Come on,franco.
- Let's go,frank!

10:29.615 --> 10:30.870
Frankie.

10:38.070 --> 10:40.350
Come on,franco!

11:02.090 --> 11:03.515
Frankie!

11:03.550 --> 11:07.590
I haven't seen a guy get knocked out
with a body shot since tyson-spinks.

11:08.890 --> 11:13.390
Only question now is who's gonna tell
frankie this new girlfriend might be a lesbo.

11:13.425 --> 11:15.582
I don't know. Sounds
like a probie job to me.

11:15.617 --> 11:17.705
Yeah,right. I don't graduate till next week.

11:17.740 --> 11:20.680
- It'll wait till then.
- All right,let's go,guys. Come on.

11:22.130 --> 11:24.460
I
- I know I missed the fight,but I got you a diet.

11:24.495 --> 11:26.540
I'm not thirsty now.

11:26.575 --> 11:27.920
Not thirsty?

11:28.970 --> 11:30.930
Thank you,boo.

11:37.240 --> 11:38.340
Check.

11:39.230 --> 11:40.880
How are you?

11:43.230 --> 11:45.270
Afternoon,mr. Garrity. Lookin' well today.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.275
- I'm feelin' well,thanks. - Yeah,so I hear.

11:47.310 --> 11:49.330
Uh,just need a quick semen
sample,I'll be out of your hair.

11:49.365 --> 11:50.505
I'm sorry. What did you say?

11:50.540 --> 11:52.080
Just raise your gown for me,please.

11:52.115 --> 11:53.202
Yeah,wh-what is this?

11:53.237 --> 11:54.255
A standard procedure.

11:54.290 --> 11:56.540
Doc just wants to make sure
that the medication isn't,

11:56.575 --> 11:57.977
uh,weakening your reproductive system.

11:58.012 --> 11:59.345
Yeah,well,I just-get out of there.

11:59.380 --> 12:01.595
No. What? I'm not gonna
do that. Are you crazy?

12:01.630 --> 12:03.755
- If you two could give us a little privacy,please.
- Sure.

12:03.790 --> 12:05.880
- There's no way I'm leavin' this room,ma.
- Wait a minute.

12:05.915 --> 12:07.130
- Hey,don't worry.
- What the-

12:07.165 --> 12:08.705
You're a little nervous.

12:08.740 --> 12:11.200
I got somethin' here to
help get things goin'.

12:25.730 --> 12:27.195
Oh,my god.

12:27.230 --> 12:28.895
Gettin' to you,huh,big boy?

12:28.930 --> 12:31.300
Give me your phone. Give me your phone.

12:33.410 --> 12:34.455
Great.

12:34.490 --> 12:37.440
- I've been waitin' for this moment my whole life.
- Very funny.

12:47.210 --> 12:49.210
Where's our little cancer survivor?

12:50.550 --> 12:51.580
- What's up? - I knew you were behind this.

12:51.615 --> 12:53.247
- What's up,homie? - Hey,what's up?

12:53.282 --> 12:54.880
- What's up,frankie? - You look good.

12:55.940 --> 12:57.950
- Well,you look like a new man. - Hey,chief.

12:57.985 --> 12:59.960
Hey,look,we heard you were on the mend,and,

12:59.995 --> 13:01.445
uh,we decided to express our,

13:01.480 --> 13:04.750
uh,joy and relief in our
traditionally twisted and,

13:04.785 --> 13:07.225
of course,slightly homoerotic fashion.

13:07.260 --> 13:08.955
Well,I'm glad that I barely survived cancer,

13:08.990 --> 13:10.340
'cause you guys almost
killed me with a heart attack.

13:10.375 --> 13:12.072
That was very nice. Thank you.

13:12.107 --> 13:13.735
Yeah,wouldn't that be a bitch,huh?

13:13.770 --> 13:16.040
That's the greatest gig
I've had in years,man.

13:16.075 --> 13:18.460
This shit touches my heart.

13:19.720 --> 13:21.055
Ok.

13:21.090 --> 13:23.400
- Uh,pal,maybe you give us a minute.
- Yeah,agitate the gravel.

13:23.435 --> 13:25.185
- Big rocks.
- Bye.

13:25.220 --> 13:27.370
Ok,no problem. Hey,congratulations again.

13:27.405 --> 13:28.715
- Hey,thanks a lot.
- Whatever.

13:28.750 --> 13:31.160
- Thanks for comin'.
- Oh,jesus christ.

13:31.195 --> 13:33.535
When are they gonna let you out of here?

13:33.570 --> 13:36.070
Doc wants to keep him around a
few days,you know,just to be sure.

13:36.105 --> 13:38.075
- We were worried about you,man.
- No shit.

13:38.110 --> 13:40.240
Oh,yeah? Well,I really
appreciate you guys comin'.

13:40.275 --> 13:42.545
Honestly,it means a lot to me. Honestly.

13:42.580 --> 13:44.735
Didn't look like you were gonna
make it there for a minute,homie.

13:44.770 --> 13:46.890
- I was sayin' a prayer for you every night.
- We all were,man.

13:46.925 --> 13:48.620
- Thanks.
- Love you,sean.

13:49.290 --> 13:51.590
Ok. All right,buddy,thanks. Love you,too.

13:51.625 --> 13:52.665
You almost died.

13:52.700 --> 13:55.180
How 'bout that? That was something.

13:55.215 --> 13:56.875
Hey,a little help here,guys.

13:56.910 --> 13:58.710
All right,mikey,that's enough,buddy.

13:58.745 --> 14:00.435
Come on. Come on,bro.

14:00.470 --> 14:05.060
- All right,gaybird,come on. You're gonna pop a stitch. Jesus christ.
- Sorry. I'm sorry. Jeez.

14:05.095 --> 14:07.742
Hey,look,since this whole cancer
thing is under the F.D.N.Y.

14:07.777 --> 14:10.355
Radar and since your insurance
probably ain't covering shit,

14:10.390 --> 14:15.415
we decided to,uh,donate our winnings
from,uh,franco's fight last night to,

14:15.450 --> 14:19.300
uh,give to you to help foot the bill for
your extended stay here at chez death.

14:19.335 --> 14:20.960
5 grand.

14:21.570 --> 14:22.615
Oh,my gosh. You guys.

14:22.650 --> 14:23.940
- How do you like that,baby?
- That is amazing.

14:23.975 --> 14:25.195
We figured it would help lighten the burden,

14:25.230 --> 14:29.090
uh,between,uh,you and your ma and
your brother payin' the bills,you know?

14:29.125 --> 14:30.580
Hey,I'm not payin' for this shit.

14:30.615 --> 14:32.315
Like I got any money.

14:32.350 --> 14:34.610
Come on,terrence. Let's go get a bite.

14:34.645 --> 14:36.870
- That was great,guys. - Go away,ma.

14:40.060 --> 14:42.580
Well,uh,you-you're payin' for
this out of your own pocket?

14:42.615 --> 14:44.925
Uh,most of it,yeah,pretty much. Dude.

14:44.960 --> 14:48.700
I mean,my mother's hospital bill was
ridiculous. This must be costin' you a fortune.

14:49.530 --> 14:52.460
Well,I mean,it's-turns out it's gonna
be a lot more expensive than I thought,

14:52.495 --> 14:54.575
but,you know,I been able to
pay for most the bills by,

14:54.610 --> 14:57.245
you know,skimming off the top
from the money we made at the bar,

14:57.280 --> 14:59.880
but the doctor's found
this,uh,combination of drugs and stuff

14:59.915 --> 15:02.227
that's really got me feelin' a lot better.

15:02.262 --> 15:04.540
- Honestly. It's great.
- Amazing,right?

15:08.590 --> 15:13.650
Did-did-did you mention skimming off the...

15:13.685 --> 15:18.675
Oh,yeah,you didn't-oh,come on,you guys.

15:18.710 --> 15:22.270
How dumb can you be? I mean,I'm,like,lookin'
after the money and checkin' "the books. "

15:22.305 --> 15:25.160
When's the last time you
even saw me even open a book?

15:25.195 --> 15:26.970
Ah,that's nice. Yeah,that'S...

15:27.005 --> 15:28.410
You know?

15:29.500 --> 15:31.955
Hey,come on,guys. If it was
you,you'd do the same thing,right?

15:31.990 --> 15:34.410
I mean,jesus christ,I thought
I was gonna die. Goddamn it.

15:34.445 --> 15:37.400
I mean,what would any of you done?

15:39.140 --> 15:41.715
No,it's,uh-it's cool.

15:41.750 --> 15:43.770
Ok. I'm so glad. No! No!

15:43.800 --> 15:45.720
Come on! What's wrong with you,man?!

15:47.650 --> 15:49.430
Come on! Get off of him.
Get off of him,all right?

15:49.465 --> 15:51.180
Desperate times,desperate measures,ok,guys?

15:51.215 --> 15:52.235
Jesus. You ok?

15:52.270 --> 15:53.910
He almost died,for god's
sakes. You all right?

15:53.945 --> 15:55.760
- Calm down. Calm down.
- He's fakin'.

15:55.795 --> 15:57.160
All right,listen. You all right?

15:57.195 --> 15:59.885
It's cool.

15:59.920 --> 16:02.905
- Christ. Lou's right. It's-you
know,it was-it was,uh,yeah.

16:02.940 --> 16:05.470
- Come on. - He was on his deathbed.
But he stole,tommy. - I know.

16:05.980 --> 16:09.640
- That was my-
- Listen. He's alive. He's our brother.

16:10.130 --> 16:13.050
We ha-we're gonna have to
just forgive and forget,ok?

16:13.085 --> 16:15.350
- Thanks,tom.
- No problem. All right?

16:15.385 --> 16:17.155
All right.

16:17.190 --> 16:22.395
Jesus. I mean,you know,first things first.

16:22.430 --> 16:25.195
I mean,we will have to take
the,uh,check back,'cause,you know...

16:25.230 --> 16:27.960
Well,I mean,see,the thing is I'm
still maybe a few bucks short,

16:27.995 --> 16:30.460
so I was thinkin' if it's cool,you know...

16:30.495 --> 16:32.285
I'll just...

16:32.320 --> 16:33.970
No,no. That's ok. It's fine.

16:35.930 --> 16:38.465
That two-timin',embezzlin' piece of shit.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.680
80 grand? That's more than
our total take from the bar.

16:40.715 --> 16:42.860
You know,we could have given
him a really nice funeral

16:42.895 --> 16:44.025
if he'd had the decency to die,

16:44.060 --> 16:45.585
and we still would've had money left over.

16:45.620 --> 16:47.410
80 large. How's he ever
gonna come up with that?

16:47.445 --> 16:48.555
He's not. We are.

16:48.590 --> 16:49.600
- Bullshit. - What? - Screw him,lou.

16:50.460 --> 16:52.690
No,lou's right. Yeah,that's
easy for you to say,chief.

16:52.725 --> 16:54.097
You didn't have a piece in that bar,ok?

16:54.132 --> 16:55.435
I- I had plans for my money,you know?

16:55.470 --> 16:58.300
- I think he's right. I think we're gonna have to suck it up.
- Damn.

16:58.335 --> 17:01.810
There goes my trip to italy.
Colleen's gonna flip,man.

17:01.845 --> 17:04.025
Wait a mi-you were taking colleen to italy?

17:04.060 --> 17:06.194
For what,so you could be
pussy-whipped on foreign soil?

17:06.230 --> 17:08.410
You know,it's
- it's interesting,because historically speaking,

17:08.444 --> 17:10.740
guinea broads actually
invented the pussy whip.

17:10.775 --> 17:14.310
Hey,that's a double ethnic,uh,uh... Slur.

17:14.345 --> 17:15.515
But thanks for playin',mike.

17:15.550 --> 17:18.319
Look,guys,even if we give him the
total nut from the bar and the fight,

17:18.355 --> 17:19.962
we're still gonna be a few grand short.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.569
How are we gonna make up the difference?

17:21.605 --> 17:22.994
Charity gig.

17:23.030 --> 17:24.930
My band could play a charity gig at the bar.

17:24.964 --> 17:26.694
Whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa. What-what band?

17:26.730 --> 17:31.250
I got a band,a-and we
were playin' at the bar,

17:31.285 --> 17:32.635
I- I find that hard to believe.

17:32.670 --> 17:35.370
You know what? I heard them. I was
down there one night. They're not bad.

17:35.405 --> 17:37.745
- Well,that's a ringing endorsement.
- I'm just sayin'.

17:37.780 --> 17:40.490
And you know what? We could
probably,uh,charge extra at the door.

17:40.525 --> 17:42.867
Because it's for a charity
and everything,people will pay.

17:42.902 --> 17:45.210
Well,first with their wallets
and then with their ears.

17:45.245 --> 17:47.710
- Well,does anyone else have a better idea?
- No.

17:51.370 --> 17:54.200
All right,guys,let's get some
fliers up,and let's get the word out.

17:54.235 --> 17:57.030
In the meantime,we should
all,uh,pray to our respective gods

17:57.065 --> 17:59.130
that garrity gets a relapse and dies.

17:59.165 --> 18:01.185
Hey,look who's back.

18:01.220 --> 18:03.335
- What's goin' on? - Nothin' much.

18:03.370 --> 18:07.620
- Did you come in the firetrucks?
- No. We're off duty today.

18:07.655 --> 18:09.505
Ever since you told all those stories,

18:09.540 --> 18:12.850
he and the rest of the kids have
been obsessed with firetrucks.

18:12.885 --> 18:15.680
We should just take him
down to the firehouse.

18:15.715 --> 18:17.035
That'd be fun,right?

18:17.070 --> 18:20.605
I'm afraid he can't leave
the hospital in his condition.

18:20.640 --> 18:24.245
Well,you know what? Maybe we can
bring the trucks to you,right?

18:24.280 --> 18:27.970
We could leave the engine at the house,bring
the rig down here and the suburban.

18:28.005 --> 18:30.005
- What do you say?
- Really?

18:30.040 --> 18:32.680
- How 'bout that?
- That'd be so cool.

18:32.715 --> 18:33.855
I know,right?

18:33.890 --> 18:35.640
What do you say to the nice man?

18:35.675 --> 18:37.390
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

18:37.425 --> 18:39.050
Thank you so much.

18:40.080 --> 18:41.365
See you later.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.150
I like those football slippers.

18:43.185 --> 18:45.027
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

18:45.062 --> 18:46.835
- Nice goin',asshole. - What?

18:46.870 --> 18:51.330
Bring the trucks down here? How the hell am I gonna
swing that with needles breathing down my neck?

18:51.365 --> 18:54.180
- Well,what'd you say yes for?
- Because what am I gonna do? You put me on the spot.

18:54.215 --> 18:57.780
I'm gonna say no to this little kid's
face,get the schmuck of the year award?

18:57.815 --> 19:00.320
So we can't bring the truck?
Is that what you're sayin'?

19:00.355 --> 19:02.560
Aw,I don't know. I had
a niece who had leukemia.

19:02.595 --> 19:04.685
She died when she was 10.

19:04.720 --> 19:07.910
Look,you said we're gonna do it,so we're gonna
do it,but we gotta keep it on the down-low.

19:07.945 --> 19:09.415
- You understand?
- Ok,great.

19:09.450 --> 19:12.365
You bunch of mooks start
workin' on your poker faces.

19:12.400 --> 19:15.280
Stop starin' at these kids
like they got a third eye.

19:20.390 --> 19:22.860
Assholes.

19:24.310 --> 19:26.610
Mike says that once sean's
mom and brother take off,

19:26.645 --> 19:28.845
I can move in with those guys.

19:28.880 --> 19:31.375
Well,I'd be careful about that. Jesus.

19:31.410 --> 19:35.640
If they ever find out stupidity's
contagious,you could be in trouble.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.965
Well,I'm almost 21 years old,tommy.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.500
If I live with my mother any longer,it's
gonna be a little norman bates,you know?

19:41.535 --> 19:43.395
Nice reference.

19:43.430 --> 19:46.230
Honey,you know if you need any help with the rent,I mean
- Uh,no.

19:46.265 --> 19:50.830
Thanks,mom,but,uh,I'm a working man now.

19:50.865 --> 19:52.777
I'd rather pay my own way.

19:52.812 --> 19:54.986
Anyway,I gotta take a whiz.

19:55.021 --> 19:57.160
- Right.
- Be right back.

19:57.195 --> 20:01.180
So,you ok with this?

20:01.650 --> 20:04.245
My steak was a little rare,but
I don't like to send things back.

20:04.280 --> 20:11.410
No,I mean the-this,you know,whole
deal,the empty-nest syndrome thing.

20:11.445 --> 20:13.115
They got a pill for that.

20:13.150 --> 20:18.190
Yeah,they may have a pill for it,but
I-I'm just concerned about your feelings.

20:18.225 --> 20:20.367
Not your job to care about my feelings,ok?

20:20.402 --> 20:22.475
Just 'cause we're having sex does not mean

20:22.510 --> 20:25.180
that you suddenly gotta pretend
like you care about my feelings.

20:25.215 --> 20:27.295
Ok,I'm not.

20:27.330 --> 20:28.775
It's not because we're having sex.

20:28.810 --> 20:30.185
I'm genuinely concerned with- Ok.

20:30.220 --> 20:33.020
Well,how 'bout I don't want you to
care about my feelings?How 'bout that?

20:33.055 --> 20:39.010
Look,I just want you to care about
taking care of damien. All right?

20:39.045 --> 20:41.522
- Don't shit a shitter.
- I'm not shitting you,ok?

20:41.557 --> 20:44.000
You never cared about my
feelings before,so pfft.

20:44.035 --> 20:45.025
This is not before.

20:45.060 --> 20:47.520
- This is now. And I'm-
- You're right this isn't before!

20:47.555 --> 20:49.945
And this is the present,and
I'm gonna stay in the present.

20:49.980 --> 20:56.110
And in the present,I simply want
you to keep my baby safe on the job.

20:56.145 --> 20:57.965
All right.

20:58.000 --> 20:58.695
I
- I didn't order that.

20:58.730 --> 21:03.600
That's from the gentleman at
the bar,from your A.A. Friend.

21:03.635 --> 21:05.945
He's cute.

21:05.980 --> 21:07.265
All right,well,anyway,I just thought I'd-

21:07.300 --> 21:09.840
You know,if I were to bring up
the past-which I'm not gonna,

21:09.875 --> 21:12.297
because like I said,the past is dead.

21:12.332 --> 21:14.685
Although,apparently still breathing.

21:14.720 --> 21:17.445
But for the sake of argument,let's
just say that I were to go back,

21:17.480 --> 21:22.350
I have got a list of grievances that would
stretch from here to goddamn indochina.

21:22.385 --> 21:22.965
I know you do.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.125
- Like the time that you...
- I'm sorry.

21:24.160 --> 21:28.870
Were checking out the waitress when we
were having dinner on saint valentine's day.

21:28.905 --> 21:29.375
What year?What-

21:29.410 --> 21:35.960
And also how 'bout the time that you dismissed the
dream I had about you sleeping with cynthia nixon?

21:35.995 --> 21:36.960
I never slept with cynthia nixon.

21:36.995 --> 21:38.082
In my dream,you did.

21:38.117 --> 21:39.135
She's a lesbian.

21:39.170 --> 21:41.755
Not back when I had my
dream,she wasn't a lesbian.

21:41.790 --> 21:49.180
And listen,I have got a royal goddamn scroll
of reasons why I choose to live in the present.

21:49.215 --> 21:55.865
The past is too painful,and
the future is too scary,

21:55.900 --> 21:59.250
so all I wanna do is have dessert,finish
this little bottle of wine,

21:59.285 --> 22:01.275
go home,have sex with you,

22:01.310 --> 22:05.820
and then fall asleep with a
big,fat friggin' smile on my face.

22:05.855 --> 22:10.330
I will worry about tomorrow
when I wake up and take my pills.

22:10.365 --> 22:12.800
Ok.

22:14.190 --> 22:16.845
Case closed.

22:16.880 --> 22:21.500
Also,that time that we went
to jennifer's birthday party

22:21.535 --> 22:23.135
and we were all in the
living room with jennifer

22:23.170 --> 22:26.460
and you were in the kitchen with that
big-titted bitch with the angora sweater

22:26.495 --> 22:29.627
and then she spills her wine and you
practically lick it off with your tongue.

22:29.662 --> 22:32.760
Then they bring the cake out,and you
don't even come in to sing happy birthday.

22:32.795 --> 22:35.512
How 'bout that one?

22:35.547 --> 22:38.230
Ok,first of all-heh.

22:38.265 --> 22:40.397
Who's jennifer?

22:40.432 --> 22:42.495
She's in the past.

22:42.530 --> 22:45.740
Now I gotta take a whiz.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.665
Just like old times.

22:51.700 --> 22:53.175
You said it,pal.

22:53.210 --> 22:56.510
Tommy. Drinkin' again and lovin' it.

22:56.545 --> 22:58.890
Thank you,brother.

22:59.200 --> 23:03.580
This man changed my life. Good
times,man. Thanks. Have a great night.

23:03.615 --> 23:05.710
Bye.

23:05.990 --> 23:08.070
Who was that?

23:08.105 --> 23:10.662
My new sponsor.

23:10.697 --> 23:13.220
And here we are.

23:13.255 --> 23:14.865
Pork chops.

23:14.900 --> 23:18.550
I used the shake 'n bake,and the
gravy is from your mother's recipe.

23:18.585 --> 23:21.560
The brussels sprouts,you'll
notice,have been slightly browned,

23:21.595 --> 23:23.790
and the mashed potatoes are chunky.

23:23.825 --> 23:25.940
Just as you like them,babe.

23:25.975 --> 23:27.905
Bon appetit.

23:27.940 --> 23:31.760
Hey,could we,um,just kind of lay off
on the french expressions for a while?

23:31.795 --> 23:34.740
I,um- just a sore spot with me.

23:34.775 --> 23:36.977
Your wish is my command.

23:37.012 --> 23:39.180
- Chow down.
- Thank you.

23:44.990 --> 23:49.015
Honey,I-I don't mean to
critique your culinary skills,

23:49.050 --> 23:53.040
but I think you got a washer
in the mashed potatoes.

23:54.760 --> 23:57.410
You lose this?

24:01.430 --> 24:05.380
Is this-is this what I think it is?

24:05.415 --> 24:07.942
It is.

24:07.977 --> 24:10.435
Oh,candy.

24:10.470 --> 24:13.180
I mean,where did-where did this come from?

24:13.215 --> 24:15.890
Candy,I mean,this is comin' from left field.

24:15.925 --> 24:17.635
I mean,wh-what is this?

24:17.670 --> 24:22.160
I took what we talked about to
heart. I decided to follow it.

24:22.195 --> 24:23.695
We haven't even slept together.

24:23.730 --> 24:25.740
Ken,you have to stop obsessing about that.

24:25.775 --> 24:27.570
We have connected on a sexual level.

24:27.605 --> 24:29.667
But that was,like,2 years ago.

24:29.702 --> 24:31.695
Uh,whatever. We know that works.

24:31.730 --> 24:37.840
We've connected on a whole new level,a
more spiritual and emotional level.

24:37.875 --> 24:41.925
I think-I think I'm having a panic attack.

24:41.960 --> 24:45.670
- Just give me some air,yeah.
- S-sit down. Sit down.

24:45.705 --> 24:48.730
Look,I love taking care of you.

24:48.765 --> 24:50.735
I love cooking your meals.

24:50.770 --> 24:54.170
I love watching you eat them.
I love cleaning up after you.

24:54.205 --> 24:55.285
Here. Have a drink.

24:55.320 --> 24:58.570
I can'T.I-I can't move my arms.

24:58.605 --> 25:02.060
- No.
- This?

25:03.850 --> 25:06.000
More?

25:11.280 --> 25:17.060
Ken... I love you,and when
2 people have that connection,

25:17.095 --> 25:22.840
despite what all the other
bullshit is,you go for it.

25:22.875 --> 25:26.927
You follow your first impulse.

25:26.962 --> 25:30.945
Mine was to ask you to marry me.

25:30.980 --> 25:39.170
Now the only question is,what was your
first impulse when you figured it out?

25:40.100 --> 25:44.770
I had 2 impulses that
happened simultaneously.

25:44.805 --> 25:46.785
And they were?

25:46.820 --> 25:54.620
One was to say yes,and the
other was to pick up my knife

25:54.655 --> 25:58.292
and to drill it into my brain.

25:58.327 --> 26:01.930
I like the first one better.

26:02.880 --> 26:06.950
I do,too,I think.

26:09.150 --> 26:13.170
- Damn,that was-oh,my-
- That was fun,huh?

26:13.205 --> 26:14.805
Fun?

26:14.840 --> 26:16.795
Yeah,fun and intense,you know.

26:16.830 --> 26:19.900
I mean,I was-swear to god I
was seein' colors at one point.

26:19.935 --> 26:23.965
It was like a-like a kaleidoscope in here.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.850
I mean,believe me when I tell you that
I don't say this very often at all.

26:26.885 --> 26:30.020
I am-I am just thoroughly
destroyed,you know?

26:30.055 --> 26:31.445
I mean- heh.

26:31.480 --> 26:34.490
Usually I'm the one that does
the destroyin' in this scenario.

26:34.525 --> 26:37.970
You know what I'm sayin'?

26:40.570 --> 26:42.705
What are you lookin' at?

26:42.740 --> 26:46.450
Oh,uh,nothin'.Just admirin' the view.

26:46.485 --> 26:48.697
You mean the view bein' my ass?

26:48.732 --> 26:50.875
You know,it is rather majestic.

26:50.910 --> 26:53.690
Actually somebody should hang,like,a
scenic overlook sign next to it

26:53.725 --> 26:56.435
so people could pull to the side
of the road and get a good look,

26:56.470 --> 27:00.010
maybe take some pictures with the fam
next to it,like the delaware water gap.

27:00.045 --> 27:04.570
The delaware water gap. You want some water?

27:05.310 --> 27:07.530
Well,you better hydrate up,champ.

27:07.565 --> 27:09.492
This fight ain't over yet.

27:09.527 --> 27:11.420
Baby,you're gonna kill me.

27:11.455 --> 27:13.680
I love it.

27:14.120 --> 27:16.920
Guys'll tell you the life of a probie sucks.

27:16.955 --> 27:20.145
You get hazed,get your balls busted.

27:20.180 --> 27:22.865
You get to pull every
shit detail in the house.

27:22.900 --> 27:28.200
But if you stick it out,get to take out your
anger and your resentment on the next poor schmuck.

27:28.235 --> 27:29.825
Cool. Hey,lou.

27:29.860 --> 27:31.630
Hey,junior. No school today?

27:31.665 --> 27:33.555
Short day.

27:33.590 --> 27:35.025
Exam's comin' up.

27:35.060 --> 27:37.510
Chief and mike were just
givin' me some study tips.

27:37.545 --> 27:39.720
Kid's sharp. I got a good feeling.

27:39.755 --> 27:41.255
Mi gente.

27:41.290 --> 27:43.350
I have been to the promised land.

27:43.385 --> 27:44.655
Bayonne?

27:44.690 --> 27:46.495
I closed the deal with carla.

27:46.530 --> 27:48.590
This chick nearly put me in
the hospital from dehydration.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.615
I'm tellin' you,at one
point,I kinda,like,blacked out,

27:50.650 --> 27:53.780
and when I came to,we were-we were
bangin' in an entirely different room.

27:53.815 --> 27:54.855
We got any ginseng around here?

27:54.890 --> 27:58.110
Wa-wa-wait. So,frank,out of all the
girls you bagged in the last few years,

27:58.145 --> 27:59.205
you're sayin' she's the best?

27:59.240 --> 28:00.395
That's exactly what I'm sayin',mikey.

28:00.430 --> 28:03.990
I mean,for the first time in my life,I
was completely outbanged by a woman,

28:04.025 --> 28:06.642
and I cherish every masochistic moment.

28:06.677 --> 28:09.225
Who knew gay chicks were the way to go?

28:09.260 --> 28:11.550
Yo,we should go out and
hit up a few lesbian bars,

28:11.585 --> 28:15.425
you know,see if we can wrangle us-what?

28:15.460 --> 28:20.090
First time a probie steps into the shit
pile is the worst,but it'll scrape off.

28:20.125 --> 28:22.760
Eventually. Good luck to you. You,too.

28:22.795 --> 28:23.665
Thanks.

28:23.700 --> 28:25.255
What do you mean,gay chicks?

28:25.290 --> 28:26.775
You guys didn't tell him yet?

28:26.810 --> 28:29.070
I already told you that was a probie job.

28:29.105 --> 28:30.835
What do you mean,gay chicks?

28:30.870 --> 28:36.730
We were just hypothesizing about your
girl carla's sexual,you know,orientation.

28:36.765 --> 28:38.820
Just because she's athletic
doesn't mean she's gay,all right?

28:38.855 --> 28:40.420
I just bought my mother
a treadmill last month.

28:40.455 --> 28:41.995
Does that mean she's a carpet muncher,too?

28:42.030 --> 28:44.605
I don't know. Does you mother
shake hands like hulk hogan?

28:44.640 --> 28:47.265
Ok,this is the point where you shut
your face,probie,or I shut it for you.

28:47.300 --> 28:51.180
Come on,franco. You gotta admit,I mean,you
know,you've seen her-her body language,

28:51.215 --> 28:53.235
her mannerisms,the way
that she carries herself,

28:53.270 --> 28:56.040
the way she could probably carry
any one of us if she wanted to.

28:56.075 --> 28:59.490
You gotta admit she's
a little,you know,butch.

28:59.525 --> 29:00.945
Carla's not a lesbo,ok?

29:00.980 --> 29:03.190
The shit this chick did to me last
night,there's no way she's gay.

29:03.225 --> 29:05.665
Lesbos don't have moves
like that. Reverse cowgirl?

29:05.700 --> 29:09.250
Hey,come on,frank. I mean,I know
you're really into her and everything,

29:09.285 --> 29:10.625
and she's hot,a-and to
be honest with you,dude,

29:10.660 --> 29:13.655
we all'd like to get a piece
of that ass,but,come on,dude.

29:13.690 --> 29:16.650
She's gotta be a fuzzbumper,you
know?I mean,o-or at least bi.

29:16.685 --> 29:18.235
And mike would know.

29:18.270 --> 29:21.020
Yeah,I'm sure he would. You know
what?First of all,lou,you don't know her,ok?

29:21.055 --> 29:22.720
She's different than the other girls.

29:22.755 --> 29:24.665
Well,there's no debatin' that.

29:24.700 --> 29:26.695
Ok,you know what?I'm not
even gonna let this upset me.

29:26.730 --> 29:29.940
You guys are obviously all just jealous 'cause
I got a little slice of heaven last night,

29:29.975 --> 29:32.580
and none of you pussies did.

29:33.630 --> 29:35.745
Oh,yeah. You bad girl.

29:35.780 --> 29:38.950
Uh,if you guys'll excuse me,I'm gonna go
on up and continue the extremely hot and,

29:38.985 --> 29:43.510
uh,steamy sext messaging conversation
we're currently involved in.

29:46.500 --> 29:48.460
Wait until she tries to
do him with her strap-on.

29:48.495 --> 29:51.530
That ought to wake him up.

29:52.340 --> 29:55.220
You know,you're gonna
have to learn one day that,

29:55.255 --> 29:58.100
um,I'm the king of the
one-liners around here.

29:58.135 --> 30:00.425
Hey,you snooze,you lose.

30:00.460 --> 30:04.070
Anyway,I gotta hit the books,boys.

30:04.105 --> 30:06.980
See you soon.

30:10.170 --> 30:14.220
Oh,I can't wait to get
this kid into this house.

30:28.930 --> 30:31.220
Ok,kids. Be careful.

30:31.255 --> 30:33.540
Stay back.

30:35.110 --> 30:36.820
What's wrong with that guy?

30:36.855 --> 30:39.420
Oh,you mean dominic?

30:39.710 --> 30:40.675
Poor kid.

30:40.710 --> 30:44.070
He had a tumor removed from
his calf over a week ago.

30:44.105 --> 30:46.050
Skin cancer?

30:46.250 --> 30:49.720
The only reason he's still on the ward
is because his -pardon my language-

30:49.755 --> 30:52.985
asshole parents are on
vacation in the greek isles.

30:53.020 --> 30:56.480
Wait a minute. His parents went
to greece while he had cancer?

30:56.515 --> 30:58.180
Unbelievable.

30:58.215 --> 30:59.245
Jesus.

30:59.280 --> 31:01.850
No love,no care,no role models.

31:01.885 --> 31:04.837
I feel for that kid. I really do.

31:04.872 --> 31:07.790
Sounds like a job for uncle lou.

31:15.990 --> 31:17.055
Hey,buddy.

31:17.090 --> 31:18.085
I'm mike.

31:18.120 --> 31:20.170
- I'm david.
- Hey,david.

31:20.205 --> 31:22.185
Hey,you wanna go on the truck?

31:22.220 --> 31:26.110
Aw,come on. Don't be afraid. It'll
be fun. I'm a fireman. Let's go.

31:26.145 --> 31:29.347
She's pretty,she's
funny,she's smart,she's sexy.

31:29.382 --> 31:32.515
Aw,so what?So she likes
to drink beer and box

31:32.550 --> 31:34.560
and go to football games
and heckle the other team?

31:34.595 --> 31:35.635
That's all stuff I like to do.

31:35.670 --> 31:41.550
But you're a boy. Girls should like
ponies and rainbows and dolls and stuff.

31:41.585 --> 31:44.800
Yeah,maybe if they're 10 years old.

31:45.240 --> 31:47.795
Hey,guys. You got room for 2 more?

31:47.830 --> 31:50.450
Yeah,come on in. To be continued,all right?

31:50.485 --> 31:52.690
What's up,buddy?

31:54.880 --> 31:57.850
Pretty cool,huh?

31:58.770 --> 32:00.230
What's the matter?

32:00.265 --> 32:03.057
It's big.

32:03.092 --> 32:05.815
Well,yeah.

32:05.850 --> 32:09.235
I mean,you know,it-it's-it's
probably a lot like,

32:09.270 --> 32:12.585
uh,you know,the first
time you saw santa claus.

32:12.620 --> 32:15.985
I mean,it's big,but it's
like,uh,maybe a little bit scary.

32:16.020 --> 32:18.310
I remember my kids were scared the
first time they saw santa claus,

32:18.345 --> 32:20.447
but it's a good scary,you know what I mean?

32:20.482 --> 32:22.515
It's like y-you have this idea of what it's-

32:22.550 --> 32:25.135
he's gonna look like,and
he's gonna be-you get there.

32:25.170 --> 32:27.685
He's big,and he's red,and
- and you have all the stuff

32:27.720 --> 32:32.360
- that you're plannin' to say to him-
- Santa's not real.

32:32.890 --> 32:37.360
All right,I-santa claus was a bad example.

32:37.680 --> 32:40.690
Tell you what. You-you wanna go
in the suburban,the smaller truck,

32:40.725 --> 32:44.480
and then we can kinda work
our way up to the big rig?

32:44.515 --> 32:47.545
And I- and I'll let you,uh-you could even,

32:47.580 --> 32:51.475
- you know,run the siren a couple
times and really scare the sh- - Shit?

32:51.510 --> 32:55.960
I was gonna say,"crap," but,yeah,you can scare
the shit out of people. What do you think?

32:55.995 --> 32:58.130
- Ok.
- Cool. Come on.

32:58.165 --> 33:00.640
You ride shotgun.

33:01.420 --> 33:03.375
What's goin' on here,big guy?

33:03.410 --> 33:05.405
You're one to talk,fatty.

33:05.440 --> 33:07.365
This stupid thing won't open.

33:07.400 --> 33:09.075
Hey,I'll do it. I'll do it. Stand back.

33:09.110 --> 33:11.850
See,they got a latch on
the bottom. There you go.

33:11.885 --> 33:14.597
That's where we hide all
the tools. You like that?

33:14.632 --> 33:17.275
That's called a-a
halligan. We use that-yeah.

33:17.310 --> 33:19.945
We use that for-you really
shouldn-no. You know what?

33:19.980 --> 33:24.740
You really shouldn't be,um,playin' with
this,'cause it's a little-a little,uh,dangerous.

33:24.775 --> 33:27.425
But these are the axes
that we have,and,uh,yeah,

33:27.460 --> 33:32.570
that's,um,a-a 6-foot hook,and that's-we
use that for venting the,uh-the roof.

33:32.605 --> 33:33.865
You know,why don't you,uh
- hey,you know what?

33:33.900 --> 33:36.155
Why don't we go in the cab,and
you can play with the siren.

33:36.190 --> 33:38.750
- Would you like that?
- Screw the siren. Let's play lord of the rings.

33:38.785 --> 33:42.040
Hey,easy,gandalf,easy. Hey,come
here. Come here. Come here.

33:42.075 --> 33:44.365
Look,these aren't toys,ok?

33:44.400 --> 33:46.560
Whatever. You're just like my dad.

33:46.595 --> 33:49.045
Hey,dominic,come here.

33:49.080 --> 33:53.455
My dad was an asshole who
was never around,too,ok?

33:53.490 --> 33:57.060
And I- I just-I just don't want
you to hurt yourself here,ok?

33:57.095 --> 33:58.705
Yeah,I guess.

33:58.740 --> 34:02.260
Let's go play with the
siren,all right?Let's go.

34:02.750 --> 34:04.275
Son of a bitch.

34:04.310 --> 34:05.800
Not so scary,right?

34:05.835 --> 34:08.735
I guess.

34:08.770 --> 34:11.054
What's the matter?

34:11.090 --> 34:13.304
I'm gonna die.

34:13.340 --> 34:17.199
No-pfft. Don't-don't talk like that.

34:17.235 --> 34:19.054
Why not?It's true.

34:19.090 --> 34:22.590
They tell me I'm gonna be
ok,but I see it in their faces-

34:22.625 --> 34:26.659
doctors,nurses,the other kids,my parents.

34:26.695 --> 34:29.032
Not you.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.853
Why is that?

34:30.888 --> 34:32.605
Timmy,listen.

34:32.639 --> 34:37.139
Don't say it. Don't lie to me
like all the rest of them and

34:37.175 --> 34:41.639
tell me everything's gonna be
ok,but it's not,and I know it.

34:41.675 --> 34:48.175
I wasn't gonna say any of that crap.

34:48.210 --> 34:51.830
Listen,I-you know,I w-I
work in a job where,you know,

34:51.864 --> 34:55.764
sometimes people that
are supposed to live die,

34:55.800 --> 35:00.620
and-and then sometimes people that you
think are gonna die,they don't die,they live.

35:00.655 --> 35:03.700
I got a buddy who's up
in,uh-in the hospital right now,

35:03.735 --> 35:06.465
and he's got cancer in his kidney,

35:06.500 --> 35:09.440
and for a while,it was
really ba-it was really scary.

35:09.475 --> 35:12.175
But now he's better.

35:12.210 --> 35:16.380
So,I mean,that doesn't mean that
he's gonna walk out of the hospital,

35:16.415 --> 35:20.515
like,tomorrow morning a-and not get
hit by a bus,you know what I mean?

35:20.550 --> 35:25.730
You can't worry about stuff like that. You
gotta just-you know,you gotta be in the moment.

35:25.765 --> 35:29.755
You can't worry about buses and stuff.

35:29.790 --> 35:33.250
I mean,like today. Today's good,right?I mean,we got the
- we got the 2 trucks here,

35:33.285 --> 35:36.490
and we got-and your
friends,and it's nice out.

35:36.525 --> 35:38.955
I guess so.

35:38.990 --> 35:42.055
Listen,you seem like a tough guy to me.

35:42.090 --> 35:48.100
I mean,you're tougher than me,and you're tougher
than all these big,strong firemen guys combined.

35:48.135 --> 35:50.065
And I don't put a lot of,you know,

35:50.100 --> 35:54.565
stock in hope and "keep
hope alive" and stuff,

35:54.600 --> 35:58.980
but,you know,when it comes to you,I
think I do. I got a lot of hope in you.

35:59.015 --> 36:03.560
I think you got a lot of fight
in you,and I think that's-really,

36:03.595 --> 36:06.520
that's all you can do is
kinda hope for the best,

36:06.555 --> 36:10.080
and maybe that's what you'll get.

36:10.115 --> 36:13.085
Or maybe I won'T.

36:13.120 --> 36:18.010
Yeah,but,you know,hopin' can't hurt.

36:18.045 --> 36:19.935
Right?

36:19.970 --> 36:22.315
Can I hit the siren again?

36:22.350 --> 36:26.510
Su-you can hit that siren as
many times as you got- Yeah. See?

36:26.545 --> 36:30.260
How 'bout that,huh?Hit it again.

36:30.295 --> 36:31.937
Nice.

36:31.972 --> 36:33.545
Amazing.

36:33.580 --> 36:34.965
I mean,they look so happy.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.525
I've never seen them so thrilled.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.185
Don't you guys have to get the trucks back?

36:39.220 --> 36:42.230
Aw,forget about that. It's against
regulations,but it doesn't matter.

36:42.265 --> 36:46.830
I don't care if needles or
anybody else finds out about this.

36:46.865 --> 36:49.760
Could be the best thing
I ever did in my life.

36:49.795 --> 36:51.005
Where's the ignition?

36:51.040 --> 36:55.900
There's no ignition. You just flip the
perko switch,and you press the on button.

36:55.935 --> 36:57.480
Aren't most trucks standard shift?

36:57.515 --> 36:58.745
Most,but not this one.

36:58.780 --> 37:01.270
You seem to know a lot about trucks.

37:01.305 --> 37:03.725
My asshole dad owns a trucking company.

37:03.760 --> 37:06.220
The guys at the yard showed me a few things.

37:06.255 --> 37:07.647
So do you ride in this truck?

37:07.682 --> 37:09.005
Lieutenants always ride shotgun.

37:09.040 --> 37:10.975
So get in. We'll pretend
like we're going to a fire.

37:11.010 --> 37:15.790
All right. We'll
- we'll pretend. That'll be cool,fun. Cool.

37:16.930 --> 37:20.270
No,pretend. Dominic!Dominic,open
the door. Open the door,dominic.

37:20.305 --> 37:22.050
Shut the engine off now. We're pretending.

37:22.085 --> 37:24.615
I wanna go in the big truck now.

37:24.650 --> 37:28.100
Let's-let's go-wait. Looks like
somebody's actually already gettin' a ride.

37:28.135 --> 37:29.700
They're probably just
goin' around the circle.

37:29.735 --> 37:33.010
I wanna go around the circle.

37:35.010 --> 37:36.205
O- that's bad.

37:36.240 --> 37:39.135
Follow that goddamn truck.
Come on,tommy!Let's go!Move!

37:39.170 --> 37:41.990
Goddamn kids!I'm gonna strangle
every one of those little shits!

37:42.025 --> 37:43.200
Timmy,put your,uh,seat belt on.

37:43.235 --> 37:45.680
Come on,come on,come on.

37:52.690 --> 37:54.750
Dominic,stop the truck. Dominic.

37:54.785 --> 37:56.870
Jesus. What the-

37:58.370 --> 37:59.940
We ain't gonna never catch 'em,tommy.

37:59.975 --> 38:02.290
I'm tryin'.

38:05.230 --> 38:10.610
Yo,stop the truck,dominic,right
now!Pull over. Dominic-

38:11.970 --> 38:14.980
It's gonna be ok. You're gonna be fine.

38:20.160 --> 38:22.630
Holy shit!We're gonna die!

38:27.580 --> 38:30.700
Come on. Come on,tommy.

38:31.370 --> 38:34.320
Stop the goddamn truck!

38:40.250 --> 38:42.185
Oh,my god.

38:42.220 --> 38:43.480
Come on,go around it. Come on. Hurry up.

38:43.515 --> 38:44.525
All right,all right.

38:44.560 --> 38:48.450
- Can I hit the siren again?
- Yeah,go ahead.

38:55.810 --> 38:57.245
Come on,man. Hit it. Let's go.

38:57.280 --> 38:58.680
What does it look like I'm doin'?

38:58.715 --> 39:00.640
I'm drivin'.

39:06.450 --> 39:08.870
Stop the truck,kid!

39:08.905 --> 39:10.145
Just A...

39:10.180 --> 39:13.390
You want me to drive,tommy?Come
on,man. What are you doin'?

39:13.425 --> 39:15.057
Faster,tommy!Faster!

39:15.092 --> 39:16.655
Damn these cancer kids.

39:16.690 --> 39:21.120
Not you,timmy. There's still
hope. The other-you know.

39:28.290 --> 39:29.665
Hit the brake.

39:29.700 --> 39:32.190
Stop the goddamn-uhh.

39:37.370 --> 39:39.620
You ok?

39:39.655 --> 39:42.317
Thank you.

39:42.352 --> 39:44.980
I can die now.

39:46.920 --> 39:48.965
That was awesome!

39:49.000 --> 39:52.150
Can we play lord of the rings now?

39:53.490 --> 39:58.700
If I were your asshole
parents,I'd stay in goddamn greece.
