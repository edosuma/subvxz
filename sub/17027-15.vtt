KARA: When I was a child,
my planet Krypton was dying.

00:04.938 --> 00:08.442
I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin.

00:08.476 --> 00:10.278
But my pod got
knocked off-course

00:10.311 --> 00:12.012
and by the time I got here,

00:12.046 --> 00:16.050
my cousin
had already grown up
and become Superman.

00:16.884 --> 00:18.719
I hid who I really was

00:18.752 --> 00:22.823
until one day
when an accident forced me
to reveal myself to the world.

00:22.856 --> 00:26.627
To most people, I'm a reporter
at CatCo Worldwide Media.

00:26.660 --> 00:29.630
But in secret, I work with my
adoptive sister for the DEO

00:29.663 --> 00:31.565

from alien life

00:31.599 --> 00:34.602

that means to cause it harm.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.675
Previously on Supergirl...

00:41.709 --> 00:45.012
I've never met a human that
was actually up for dating
an alien.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.748
Well, now you have.

00:47.781 --> 00:49.650
HANK HENSHAW: Any idea what
Jeremiah stole from us?

00:49.683 --> 00:52.653
It's not good. He took
the national alien registry.

00:52.686 --> 00:53.987
What is it?

00:54.021 --> 00:56.090
Cadmus has the list of
all the aliens in the country.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.359
How could you?

00:58.392 --> 01:00.328
You betrayed everyone.

I said I did it for you?

03:23.203 --> 03:24.672

on that list.

03:44.492 --> 03:46.159

Not without compromising

03:48.462 --> 03:50.130

You'd be able to tell if she
was a credible source or not.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.463
Better be an exclusive.

04:55.496 --> 04:57.631
Of course. She won't
speak to anyone else.

I'm worried about.

a threat.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.438
When we find Cadmus,
things are gonna get rough

05:37.471 --> 05:40.541
and he could get caught
in the crossfire.

05:40.574 --> 05:44.745
He stole the registry from
the DEO. He hurt J'onn.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.181
But, Maggie, I know him.

05:48.215 --> 05:50.050
He's a good man.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.786
And even if he is
siding with Cadmus,
there has to be a reason.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.688
He's either, I don't know,

05:54.722 --> 05:56.590

or they're blackmailing him,

05:56.624 --> 05:59.460
or they are

Hey, Chief.
Supergirl is here
in James' office.

11:22.249 --> 11:25.085
She didn't want
to cause a scene outside.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.421
How considerate.

11:35.095 --> 11:37.297
Snapper Carr.
Pleasure to meet you.

11:38.631 --> 11:39.933
You're on the record,
Supergirl.

11:39.967 --> 11:42.135
-You good with that?
-Yes.

11:42.169 --> 11:43.971
Danvers says
you were her source.

11:44.004 --> 11:46.373
You claim Cadmus stole
the alien registry?

11:46.406 --> 11:50.110
-Yes, I can confirm that.
-So who was your source?

11:50.143 --> 11:53.246
I'm sorry, but that
information is confidential.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.248
You just said you were
on the record.
Which is it?

11:55.282 --> 11:58.051
It doesn't matter who told me.
What matters is the story.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.353
Not unless I can verify
your story's origin.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.389
You expect people
to just trust you?

12:04.291 --> 12:07.060
-I never lie.
-Mmm, bully for you.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.862
But you're talking
to a journalist.

12:08.896 --> 12:12.299
We believe everyone
is lying until we can
prove they're not.

12:12.966 --> 12:15.368
So, this list.

12:15.402 --> 12:18.138
Who had it
in the first place?
Who was it stolen from?

12:18.171 --> 12:19.739
I won't reveal their name,

12:19.773 --> 12:22.843
but I can confirm it is
a classified federal agency

12:22.876 --> 12:25.045
who reported the theft
from their servers.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.380
So, you got your intel
from a government black site.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.016
How long have you been
involved with them?

12:29.049 --> 12:31.151
Well, that's a leading
question, Mr. Carr.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.986
I never said
I was involved with them.

12:33.020 --> 12:35.188
I'm not the story.
Cadmus is.

12:36.990 --> 12:39.626
-All right.
-(BEEPS)

12:39.659 --> 12:42.830
Off the record. I won't reveal
it came from you.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.999
You give me a name,
I'll verify it myself
and bam,

12:46.033 --> 12:48.001
we're off to the races.

12:48.035 --> 12:51.371

about the stolen list?

-Great.

13:06.719 --> 13:09.322
How did it go? (PANTING)
Did you get everything
you needed?

13:09.356 --> 13:12.059
-No. She gave me nothing.
-Nothing, but...

13:12.092 --> 13:15.095
But I... She was in here,
and I heard her saying
a lot of stuff.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.563
You heard her
withholding a lot of stuff.

13:16.596 --> 13:18.798
-But she told you the truth.
-She told me parts.

13:18.832 --> 13:21.568
It's not a journalist's job
to cherry pick and decide

13:21.601 --> 13:23.803

Cadmus is gonna
slaughter them,
everyone they've abducted.

Now, I can stop them,
but only with your help.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.115
I wanna trust you,

14:08.148 --> 14:10.183
but I have to know that
you're telling me the truth.

14:10.217 --> 14:11.751
The only reason
I'm alive right now

14:11.784 --> 14:14.621
is because Cadmus believes
I turned to their side.

14:14.654 --> 14:17.357
The only way I could prove
my loyalty to them

14:17.390 --> 14:19.359
was to betray
my own children.

Still piping hot.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.872
Here, eat one.

39:33.905 --> 39:36.174
Or all of them.
I promise
you'll feel better.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.944
Ah, I don't know.

39:38.977 --> 39:42.448
Hey... Hey, you're gonna
get another job.

39:42.481 --> 39:45.984
Yeah, but I...
I don't want another job.

39:46.017 --> 39:48.887
Reporting is my calling.
I help people.

39:48.920 --> 39:49.921
Yeah?

39:50.789 --> 39:52.991
-You know who else does?
-Who?

39:53.592 --> 39:55.260
Supergirl.

39:55.293 --> 39:57.195
-Mmm.
-Yeah.

39:57.228 --> 39:58.864
You know, it's just...

39:58.897 --> 40:01.433
When I write,
I don't need a yellow sun.

40:01.467 --> 40:02.801
It's just me.

40:04.269 --> 40:05.637
Supergirl is

40:05.671 --> 40:08.474
what I can do.
Kara is who I am.

40:12.611 --> 40:14.780
I really loved that job.

40:18.016 --> 40:21.687
Hey. You have so much
to offer this world.

40:23.388 --> 40:25.791
So don't let Snapper
or anyone else

40:25.824 --> 40:28.727
tell you differently.
Okay?

40:37.836 --> 40:41.006
-You know something?
-What?

40:41.039 --> 40:44.109
Maybe being Supergirl
and having you is enough.

40:46.678 --> 40:48.914
-You think so?
-Yeah.

40:54.920 --> 40:56.788
-I hope so.
-(CHUCKLES)

41:12.571 --> 41:14.072
I feel different.

41:14.105 --> 41:17.042
Yes. There is something
about this place.

41:18.710 --> 41:19.978
NAVIGATOR: Your Highnesses.

41:22.514 --> 41:24.215
We've reached
our coordinates.

41:26.852 --> 41:28.086
Finally.

41:28.987 --> 41:30.488
We've arrived.
