00:02.168 --> 00:04.086
male announcer: ON THE LAST
EPISODE OF <i> INK MASTER,</i>

00:04.170 --> 00:08.591
12 RIVAL ARTISTS WERE FIGHTING
TO SETTLE THE SCORE.

00:08.675 --> 00:10.760
IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

00:10.844 --> 00:12.053
WORKING IN TEAMS OF THREE

00:12.137 --> 00:15.932
HAD THE ARTISTS
AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS.

00:16.015 --> 00:17.142
- AND THEN A LINE DOWN THERE.

00:17.225 --> 00:19.018
SO THAT NEEDS TO BE BLACK.
FATTER AT THE BASE.

00:19.102 --> 00:20.937
- MARK NEEDS TO JUST SHUT THE
[bleep] UP AND LET ME TATTOO.

00:21.020 --> 00:23.815
announcer: AND EMILY'S
MEDICAL ISSUES...

00:25.483 --> 00:27.068
announcer: FLARE TENSIONS
IN THE LOFT.

00:27.152 --> 00:28.319
- DON'T YOU DARE TALK TO ME

00:28.403 --> 00:29.946
ABOUT WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME
AND WHAT'S NOT.

00:30.029 --> 00:31.573
YOU WEREN'T
IN THAT GODDAMN BATHROOM

00:31.656 --> 00:32.615
WATCHING ME DIE ON THE FLOOR.

00:32.698 --> 00:33.908
HOW DARE YOU?

00:33.992 --> 00:36.411
announcer: IN THE ELIMINATION,
A MASSIVE TWIST

00:36.494 --> 00:39.164
PUT THE POWER
IN THE HANDS OF THE ARTISTS.

00:39.247 --> 00:42.667
- EACH OF YOU MUST DECIDE
WHICH ARTIST ON YOUR TEAM

00:42.751 --> 00:45.211
WAS THE WEAKEST.

00:45.295 --> 00:46.588
- I HAD HIM FIX YOUR COLOR WORK
AT THE END 'CAUSE YOU--

00:46.671 --> 00:49.466
- I WAS [bleep] WITH THAT ON MY
HOUR BECAUSE I RAN OUT OF TIME.

00:49.549 --> 00:50.759
- YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE IT RIGHT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:50.842 --> 00:54.137
- NOW I GOT TO PROVE MYSELF
TO THEM, GET THIS [bleep] MONEY,

00:54.220 --> 00:55.805
AND GO THE [bleep] HOME.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.057
announcer: JULIA, TY'ESHA,
AND DON

00:58.141 --> 01:02.604
HAD TO FACE OFF TATTOOING
AN OLIVER PECK DESIGN.

01:02.687 --> 01:04.438
- SHE PUT THE TATTOO ON
BACKWARDS,

01:04.522 --> 01:05.899
AND THEY'RE TESTING FUNDAMENTALS
OF TATTOOING.

01:05.982 --> 01:08.902
LIKE LEADING LAMBS
TO THE SLAUGHTER.

01:08.985 --> 01:09.652
- DON.
- YOUR OUTLINE ON THIS THING

01:09.736 --> 01:11.654
IS WHAT'S TOUGH.
- JULIA.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.656
- MAKING THESE TEETH BLACK

01:13.740 --> 01:15.283
IS A ODD CHOICE.
- TY'ESHA.

01:15.366 --> 01:17.076
- OBVIOUSLY,
IT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN FLIPPED.

01:17.160 --> 01:20.872
THAT BACKWARDS DESIGN
IS A KILLER.

01:20.955 --> 01:24.334
- TY'ESHA, YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE INK MASTER.

01:28.213 --> 01:30.340
announcer:
11 ARTISTS REMAIN,

01:30.423 --> 01:34.177
BUT ONLY ONE WILL EARN
A $100,000 PRIZE

01:34.260 --> 01:36.805
AND THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

02:35.989 --> 02:36.489
- DON, I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE
THAT TATTOO.

02:36.573 --> 02:39.075
I WAS LIKE...

02:39.158 --> 02:40.451
THAT THING WAS BEAT.

02:40.535 --> 02:42.370
JULIA JUST CRUSHED YOU.

02:42.453 --> 02:43.538
- THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO DO

02:43.621 --> 02:46.457
WAS JUST PROVE MYSELF
AND GET RESPECT BACK.

02:46.541 --> 02:49.043
- I RESPECT YOU AS A PERSON.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.086
I'M NOT GONNA
KISS YOUR ASS

02:50.169 --> 02:51.129
'CAUSE YOU DID ONE GOOD TATTOO.

02:51.212 --> 02:53.423
- WELL,
I'VE HAD TO PROVE IT BEFORE,

02:53.506 --> 02:55.508
AND I PROVED TO EVERYONE AGAIN
THAT, LIKE, I AM HERE.

02:55.592 --> 02:56.593
MY HEAD'S IN THE GAME,
AND I'M JUST READY.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.970
- DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU HAVE THE SKILL LEVEL

02:59.053 --> 03:00.263
TO BEAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE
IN THE HOUSE?

03:00.346 --> 03:01.347
- ABSOLUTELY.

03:01.431 --> 03:02.974
- I DON'T SEE YOU BEATING
A LOT OF PEOPLE.

03:03.057 --> 03:06.185
I DON'T SEE YOU BEATING JASON.
I DON'T SEE YOU BEATING JOSH.

03:06.269 --> 03:08.938
- I'VE ALREADY BEATEN PEOPLE
THAT I WASN'T EXPECTED TO BEAT.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.024
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE TATTOO, MAN.

03:11.107 --> 03:13.359
I JUST GOT TO TATTOO
AND DO THE BEST I CAN DO.

03:13.443 --> 03:14.903
IT'S A TOUGH COMPETITION,

03:14.986 --> 03:16.738
BUT I KNOW I CAN BE GREAT.

03:16.821 --> 03:18.156
- OH, YEAH?

03:36.883 --> 03:38.301
- WELCOME, ARTISTS.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.303
YOU ENTERED THIS COMPETITION
WITH ONLY ONE GOAL IN MIND,

03:40.386 --> 03:44.599
TO EARN $100,000,
A FEATURE IN <i> INKED</i> MAGAZINE,

03:44.682 --> 03:46.601
AND THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

03:46.684 --> 03:48.978
YOU'VE MADE IT THIS FAR,
BUT TEN OTHER ARTISTS

03:49.062 --> 03:51.397
STILL STAND IN YOUR WAY.

03:51.481 --> 03:55.276
THIS WEEK WE'RE TESTING DETAIL.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.904
{\an8}- DETAIL IS THE USE
OF INTRICATE LINES

03:57.987 --> 03:59.989
{\an8}AND SHADING
THAT TAKE YOUR TATTOO

04:00.073 --> 04:03.451
{\an8}FROM AN ORDINARY TATTOO
TO AN AMAZING TATTOO.

04:03.534 --> 04:05.078
- CREATED BY SAILORS
OVER 200 YEARS AGO,

04:05.161 --> 04:08.665
TODAY YOU MUST CREATE SCRIMSHAW.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.708
- SCRIMSHAW.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.001
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT IS.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.337
- YOU MUST USE NEEDLES
AND BLADES TO MAKE THOUSANDS

04:14.420 --> 04:16.089
OF TINY SCRATCHES ON BONE

04:16.172 --> 04:19.425
AND THEN ADD INK TO BRING
YOUR IMAGE TO LIFE.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.552
{\an8}- SCRIMSHAW IS ALL ABOUT DETAIL.

04:21.636 --> 04:23.471
EVERY LINE HAS TO BE
SO PRECISE

04:23.554 --> 04:25.139
OR IT WILL RUIN THE DESIGN.

04:25.223 --> 04:26.349
THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY.

04:26.432 --> 04:29.811
- SAILORS SCRIMSHAWED ALL TYPES
OF BONES AND TEETH

04:29.894 --> 04:31.729
THAT THEY COULD EASILY FIND
AT SEA.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.482
TODAY, YOU WILL HAVE
THREE HOURS

04:34.565 --> 04:38.653
TO SCRIMSHAW A WALRUS OOSIK.

04:38.736 --> 04:41.364
A WALRUS OOSIK IS A PENILE BONE

04:41.447 --> 04:44.701
ONCE ALSO COMMONLY USED
FOR TOOLS AND WEAPONS.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.119
- [laughs]

04:46.202 --> 04:48.079
{\an8}- I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WALRUSES HAD PENISES.

04:48.162 --> 04:50.456
{\an8}- A WALRUS WIENER?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

04:50.540 --> 04:54.085
- THE WINNER OF TODAY'S FLASH
CHALLENGE WILL HAVE THE POWER

04:54.168 --> 04:57.880
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES
IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.924
YOU HAVE THREE HOURS
TO SCRIMSHAW,

05:00.008 --> 05:03.261
AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

05:06.305 --> 05:09.934
{\an8}- SCRIMSHAW'S A REALLY
DETAIL-ORIENTED ART FORM.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.103
{\an8}IT NEEDS TO BE VERY LEGIBLE
FROM A DISTANCE

05:12.186 --> 05:14.313
{\an8}BUT UP CLOSE HAS
AMAZING, PRECISE DETAILS.

05:18.276 --> 05:19.819
{\an8}- THE JUDGES WANT DETAIL.

05:19.902 --> 05:22.071
{\an8}I GIVE THEM BEYOND DETAIL.

05:22.155 --> 05:26.325
I GIVE THEM A CITY--MANHATTAN,
TWIN TOWERS, EVEN THE LIGHTS.

05:26.409 --> 05:28.119
I TURNED ON THE LIGHTS
ON THE BUILDING.

05:28.202 --> 05:29.579
PICTURE PERFECT.

05:31.372 --> 05:34.584
- THINK THE SAILORS HAD, LIKE,
LITTLE CONTESTS.

05:34.667 --> 05:38.087
HOW FAST CAN YOU GET ONE OF
THESE WALRUS PENILE BONES DONE?

05:38.171 --> 05:40.256
EVERYONE IS GOING
WAY TOO COMPLICATED.

05:40.339 --> 05:44.052
{\an8}BY USING A SNAKE, I CAN ACTUALLY
SHOWCASE SOME REALLY NICE DETAIL

05:44.135 --> 05:45.928
{\an8}IN A SIMPLISTIC FORM.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.221
{\an8}IT SHOULD BE A SHOE-IN.
I SHOULD HAVE ALREADY WON THIS.

05:47.305 --> 05:50.433
{\an8}- TWO HOURS REMAINING.
TWO MORE HOURS.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.729
{\an8}- I LIKE MY DESIGN.

05:54.812 --> 05:56.439
{\an8}I'M FEELING GOOD NOW
IN THIS COMPETITION.

05:56.522 --> 05:59.400
{\an8}MY NERVES GOT TO ME EARLIER,
BUT I SHOOK THAT OFF.

05:59.484 --> 06:00.943
I'M READY TO WIN
A FLASH CHALLENGE.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.153
I'M READY TO GET SKULL PICKS.

06:02.236 --> 06:02.528
I'M READY TO BE IN CONTROL.

06:07.867 --> 06:08.951
- HOW'S THAT GOING?

06:09.035 --> 06:11.954
- I DO NOT THINK
I WILL TAKE UP SCRIMSHAW.

06:12.038 --> 06:15.375
{\an8}IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME
TO WIN THIS FLASH CHALLENGE

06:15.458 --> 06:18.252
{\an8}BECAUSE I NEED THIS MORE
THAN ANYONE ELSE HERE.

06:18.336 --> 06:19.253
- WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON?
WHAT'S THE DESIGN?

06:19.337 --> 06:22.298
- I'M TRYING
TO DO SOME POLYNESIAN.

06:22.381 --> 06:26.427
I SUPPORT MY FAMILY
PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK.

06:26.511 --> 06:31.307
IT'S JUST A CONSTANT STRUGGLE
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

06:31.390 --> 06:33.726
I'M HERE TRYING
TO CHANGE OUR LIFE.

06:35.895 --> 06:37.647
- ONE HOUR LEFT.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.401
{\an8}- I'M DOING A TRADITIONAL PIECE
OF SCRIMSHAW.

06:42.485 --> 06:45.446
I WANT TO CREATE A STORY
ABOUT THREE MEN HUNTING WHALES.

06:45.530 --> 06:48.032
I KNOW WHEN I GO OUT WHALING,
I ALWAYS TAKE MY PARKA.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.700
THIS IS GONNA
BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT.

06:49.784 --> 06:51.619
I HAVE TO CRAM A LOT
OF SMALL DETAIL

06:51.702 --> 06:53.329
IN A VERY SMALL AREA.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.709
{\an8}- DON THINKING THAT HE CAN GO
TOE-TO-TOE WITH ME IS KIND

06:58.793 --> 07:00.837
{\an8}OF PATHETIC 'CAUSE WE'RE NOT
EVEN IN THE SAME REALM.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.839
HIS DESIGN IS SUPER ELEMENTARY.

07:02.922 --> 07:03.965
ALL HE'S DOING IS A BUNCH
OF SCRATCHY LINES.

07:04.048 --> 07:06.300
THERE'S NO DETAIL.

07:06.384 --> 07:08.845
IT JUST LOOKS LIKE A WHOLE BUNCH
OF [bleep] PILED TOGETHER.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.097
- 15 MINUTES TO GO, EVERYONE.

07:11.180 --> 07:12.265
- OH, MAN.

07:12.348 --> 07:16.185
THIS IS REALLY STARTING
TO SUCK.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.146
- THIS IS A LONG TIME TO HOLD
A WALRUS PENIS.

07:18.229 --> 07:19.897
{\an8}I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.691
ONCE I REALIZE HOW
TIME-CONSUMING

07:21.774 --> 07:24.152
THIS IS GONNA BE, I HAVE TO TAKE
A LOT OF THE DETAILS

07:24.235 --> 07:27.613
OUT OF MY DESIGN
JUST SO I CAN FINISH IT.

07:27.697 --> 07:29.949
- FIVE, FOUR,

07:30.032 --> 07:32.994
THREE, TWO, ONE.

07:33.077 --> 07:33.703
THAT IS IT.

07:33.786 --> 07:36.247
TIME'S UP. NO MORE ETCHING.

07:36.330 --> 07:38.291
- OH, MAN, THAT WAS ROUGH.

07:38.374 --> 07:40.251
JULIA'S SCRIMSHAW
IS SO TERRIBLE.

07:40.334 --> 07:41.210
{\an8}SHE CAN'T TATTOO.
SHE CAN'T DRAW.

07:41.294 --> 07:44.714
JULIA NEEDS TO GO HOME.

07:47.008 --> 07:48.634
- ANGEL.
- I LIKE THE DETAIL IN IT.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.094
AND IT'S DEFINITELY
RECOGNIZABLE.

07:50.178 --> 07:52.221
I LIKE THE WAY THAT YOU
DIDN'T TRY TO DO SOMETHING

07:52.305 --> 07:53.347
THAT WAS OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT,

07:53.431 --> 07:55.766
AND IT WORKS WELL
TO YOUR ADVANTAGE.

07:55.850 --> 07:56.934
- CLEEN.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.186
- ONE THING THAT STANDS OUT
TO ME

07:58.269 --> 08:00.605
IS THE VERY BOLD, HEAVY, CLEAN,
STRAIGHT LINES

08:00.688 --> 08:03.191
AND ALSO A LOT
OF SMALL CROSSHATCH SHADING.

08:03.274 --> 08:06.611
ALL THREE OF YOUR IMAGES
COME OUT VERY STRONG.

08:06.694 --> 08:07.570
- CRIS.

08:07.653 --> 08:09.113
- SO OVERALL I FEEL LIKE
YOU GOT THE HANG

08:09.197 --> 08:11.073
OF SOME
OF THE TEXTURES AND THE DETAILS,

08:11.157 --> 08:13.951
BUT AS FAR AS WHAT THE DESIGN
IS, IT'S VERY HARD TO READ

08:14.035 --> 08:16.787
AND JUST DOESN'T COME OFF
VERY WELL FOR ME.

08:16.871 --> 08:18.247
- JOSH.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.415
- THE CONTRAST IS GREAT,

08:19.498 --> 08:21.334
BUT IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE A LOT
OF DETAIL IN IT,

08:21.417 --> 08:23.419
AND WHAT LINES YOU HAVE
ARE VERY SCRATCHY

08:23.502 --> 08:25.546
AND NOT REALLY SMOOTH
AND FLOWING.

08:25.630 --> 08:26.547
IT'S PRETTY SKETCHY.

08:26.631 --> 08:27.215
- FOR THREE HOURS,
I FEEL REALLY GOOD

08:27.298 --> 08:29.467
ABOUT WHAT I ACCOMPLISHED.

08:29.550 --> 08:32.010
{\an8}- I LOVE THE FACT THAT JOSH
IS GETTING A BAD CRITIQUE.

08:32.094 --> 08:33.846
JOSH CAN DISH IT OUT,
BUT HE CAN NOT TAKE IT.

08:33.929 --> 08:35.806
- EMILY.

08:35.890 --> 08:36.640
I LIKE THAT YOU KEPT
A NAUTICAL THEME.

08:36.724 --> 08:38.976
HOWEVER,
WHEN IT COMES TO DETAIL,

08:39.059 --> 08:41.520
THIS LOOKS A LITTLE BIT MORE
CARTOONY.

08:41.604 --> 08:44.440
- I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY DETAIL WAS
THE MOTIVE BEHIND ALL OF THIS,

08:44.524 --> 08:46.776
BUT I REALLY WANT IT
TO BE LEGIBLE ALSO.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.861
- I JUST THINK IF YOU WOULD
HAVE HAD LINE WEIGHTS,

08:48.945 --> 08:51.239
MAYBE, SEPARATING
THE ACTUAL WHALE FROM THE WAVES,

08:51.322 --> 08:53.866
YOU'D HAVE BEEN BETTER
WELL SERVED.

08:53.950 --> 08:54.992
- JASON.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.285
CERTAINLY WITH THE SUCTION CUPS

08:56.369 --> 08:58.788
AND THE TENTACLES
AND IN THAT EYE AREA,

08:58.871 --> 09:00.539
IT DOES COME ACROSS
AS HAVING A LOT

09:00.623 --> 09:02.333
OF NICE DETAILS IN IT.

09:02.416 --> 09:03.334
MARK.

09:03.417 --> 09:05.002
- OUT OF ALL THE DESIGNS
THAT WE SEE TODAY,

09:05.086 --> 09:07.546
YOURS IS THE ONE THAT I THINK
FITS THE BONE THE BEST.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.090
YOU SHOW A LITTLE BIT
OF THE SERPENT

09:09.173 --> 09:10.299
GOING IN AND OUT
OF THE WATER

09:10.383 --> 09:11.968
ALL THE WAY ALONG THE LENGTH
OF THE WHOLE BONE.

09:12.051 --> 09:14.220
A LOT OF GOOD, STRONG LINE WORK,
SOME DIFFERENT LINE WEIGHTS.

09:14.303 --> 09:17.139
IT DOES SHOW SOME DETAIL.

09:17.223 --> 09:17.848
- AARON.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.475
- THE SHAPE OF IT'S REALLY NICE.

09:19.558 --> 09:21.143
IT RIDES THE BONE PERFECTLY.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.646
THE COOL TRIBAL PATTERN
THAT YOU HAVE ON BOTH SIDES

09:23.729 --> 09:26.065
DOES LEND ITSELF NICE
TO THE DESIGN.

09:26.148 --> 09:28.526
- THE BIG, BOLD LINES
MAKE THE SNAKE REALLY STAND OUT,

09:28.609 --> 09:30.820
AND THE STARK WHITE
IS VERY NICE.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.029
- DON.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.322
IT'S LEGIBLE,
AND IT DOES TELL A STORY

09:33.406 --> 09:36.033
BUT NOT TONS OF DETAIL.

09:36.117 --> 09:38.160
- WHEN I THINK OF SCRIMSHAW,
THIS IS WHAT I THINK OF.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.328
IT USUALLY TELLS A STORY.
- IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.622
THE ONLY THING
YOU'RE MISSING HERE

09:41.706 --> 09:42.707
IS A LITTLE BIT OF CONTRAST.

09:42.790 --> 09:44.208
IF YOU WOULD HAVE JUST
BEEN ABLE TO SHOW

09:44.292 --> 09:45.334
DARK AND LIGHT WITH DETAIL,

09:45.418 --> 09:47.336
ON THE PATH YOU WERE GOING,

09:47.420 --> 09:48.921
I THINK YOU HAD
THE RIGHT MIND-SET,

09:49.005 --> 09:51.048
BUT I JUST DON'T THINK
YOU ACHIEVED IT.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.258
- JULIA.

09:52.341 --> 09:53.759
- THERE'S NOT REALLY
ANY STARK BLACK.

09:53.843 --> 09:55.428
THERE'S NOT ANY REALLY
STARK WHITE.

09:55.511 --> 09:59.265
WHAT DETAIL THERE IS THERE,
IT LOOKS RUSHED AND UNFINISHED.

09:59.348 --> 10:00.266
- ERIK.

10:00.349 --> 10:03.060
I DO SEE SOME NICE AREAS
OF DARK AND LIGHT,

10:03.144 --> 10:05.688
CERTAINLY LOTS OF DIFFERENT
SHADING AND CROSSHATCHING.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.023
THERE IS DETAIL IN THERE.

10:07.106 --> 10:10.151
WHAT IT'S DETAILING
IS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT.

10:10.234 --> 10:11.694
- ERIK THINKS WAY TOO HIGH
OF HIMSELF.

10:11.777 --> 10:15.364
{\an8}REALITY CHECK--
YOU CAN'T DO EVERYTHING.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.200
- LET'S TALK ABOUT SCRIMSHAW,
TESTING FOR DETAIL,

10:18.284 --> 10:20.286
CERTAINLY JULIA
WOULD BE IN THE BOTTOM.

10:20.369 --> 10:22.830
- IT WAS A VERY POOR
REPRESENTATION OF POLYNESIAN.

10:22.913 --> 10:25.750
- AND IT WAS A PRETTY
POOR ATTEMPT AT DETAIL.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.168
- I LIKE A LOT OF ERIK'S WORK,

10:27.251 --> 10:28.878
BUT THIS THING
JUST THREW ME FOR A LOOP.

10:28.961 --> 10:31.047
- HE DID GIVE A BUNCH
OF DIFFERENT STYLES OF TECHNIQUE

10:31.130 --> 10:33.674
TO SHOW DETAIL,
BUT THE DETAIL IS UNREADABLE.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.384
- WHO WOULD BE IN THE TOP
OF THE PACK?

10:35.468 --> 10:36.469
- AARON STANDS OUT.

10:36.552 --> 10:38.721
STRONG, VIBRANT, CONTRAST,

10:38.804 --> 10:40.556
A LOT OF LITTLE FINE DETAILS.

10:40.639 --> 10:43.059
- I WAS IMPRESSED
WITH ANGEL'S DESIGN.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.227
- HE GOT A LOT MORE DONE
THAN THE OTHER COMPETITORS

10:45.311 --> 10:47.897
BY SCRATCHING OUT
THE LIGHT OF THE BONE.

10:47.980 --> 10:51.067
HE APPROACHED HIS PIECE
WITH A REALLY GOOD IDEA,

10:51.150 --> 10:53.444
AND IT WAS DEFINITELY DIFFERENT
THAN THE FIELD.

10:53.527 --> 10:56.739
- MARK TURNED IN A SEA SERPENT
WHICH WAS ALSO VERY READABLE.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.824
- WHAT I LIKE ABOUT MARK'S
THE MOST IS THAT

10:58.908 --> 11:00.951
HE WAS ABLE TO TAKE THE TEXTURE
IN THE TOP OF THE BONE

11:01.035 --> 11:04.997
AND TURN IT INTO A STORMY SKY
FOR THAT SHIP GOING DOWN,

11:05.081 --> 11:06.415
AND IT PLAYS WELL.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.542
- IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE AGREED.
LET'S LET THEM KNOW.

11:11.212 --> 11:13.422
- TODAY, YOU HAD
TO SHOW INTRICATE DETAILS

11:13.506 --> 11:16.717
WITH AN ORIGINAL AMERICAN
ART FORM, SCRIMSHAW.

11:16.801 --> 11:19.470
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED
THAT THE WINNER

11:19.553 --> 11:20.721
OF TODAY'S FLASH CHALLENGE
IS...

11:24.850 --> 11:26.727
AARON.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.063
- YOUR IMAGE WAS BOLD
AND STOOD OUT FROM A DISTANCE.

11:29.146 --> 11:31.065
I LIKED THE WAY IT WAS ABLE
TO TAKE UP THE WHOLE BONE

11:31.148 --> 11:32.274
AND STILL BE A GOOD,
CLEAN IMAGE.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.109
- THANK YOU.

11:33.192 --> 11:34.193
- YOU'LL HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN

11:34.276 --> 11:37.279
ALL HUMAN CANVASES
FOR THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

11:37.363 --> 11:38.823
{\an8}- AARON WINS HIS SCRIMSHAW

11:38.906 --> 11:41.492
{\an8}OVER MINE WHEN MINE'S
JAM-PACKED FULL OF DETAIL.

11:41.575 --> 11:43.786
{\an8}HIS HAS NONE.
NOW I'M PISSED.

11:43.869 --> 11:44.954
- HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT

11:45.037 --> 11:46.705
AND PREPARE
TO MEET YOUR CANVASES

11:46.789 --> 11:49.458
FOR THE NEXT ELIMINATION TATTOO.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.793
{\an8}- I'M GONNA HAVE
A BLAST WITH THIS

11:50.876 --> 11:53.212
{\an8}AND WATCH EVERYBODY GET
COMPLETELY SCREWED.

11:56.340 --> 11:57.967
{\an8}THEY HAVE NO CLUE
WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.135
{\an8}- THROW THE HARDEST CANVAS
AT ME?

11:59.218 --> 12:00.594
{\an8}IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

12:00.678 --> 12:02.388
- ARE YOU WILLING
TO COMPROMISE A LITTLE BIT?

12:02.471 --> 12:04.557
- BYE. HAVE A NICE LIFE.

12:04.640 --> 12:05.724
GO [bleep] YOURSELF.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.150
- I HAVE NO NEED FOR THE PEOPLE
THAT ARE TATTOOING

12:14.233 --> 12:16.444
THE WORST IN THIS COMPETITION
TO CONTINUE TO STAY HERE.

12:16.527 --> 12:17.653
I WANT THEM OUT OF HERE...
- FOR SURE.

12:17.736 --> 12:18.779
- SO THAT I CAN COMPETE
AGAINST STRONG ARTISTS.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.072
- THE WAY
THIS COMPETITION IS GOING,

12:20.156 --> 12:20.865
THERE'S NO TELLING
WHAT COULD HAPPEN.

12:20.948 --> 12:22.575
I COULD HAVE
ANOTHER BALLER DAY

12:22.658 --> 12:23.659
AND KNOCK IT OUT OF THE PARK.

12:23.742 --> 12:24.660
IT'S JUST THAT EASY.

12:24.743 --> 12:25.661
- SO DO YOU HONESTLY THINK

12:25.744 --> 12:27.746
YOU COULD BEAT ME IN--

12:27.830 --> 12:29.248
- ANYTHING?
- IN ANYTHING.

12:29.331 --> 12:30.166
- YEAH.

12:30.249 --> 12:31.417
- I SEE ME AND JOSH

12:31.500 --> 12:32.334
AT LEAST TOP FIVE.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.170
DO YOU SEE YOURSELF
BEING IN TOP FIVE?

12:34.253 --> 12:36.046
- OF COURSE.
- YOU'RE CRAZY.

12:36.130 --> 12:38.799
- THESE GUYS, THEY HAVE NO CLUE
WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.259
- THERE'S NO WAY
YOU'RE IN TOP FIVE.

12:40.342 --> 12:40.926
- THEY CAN KISS MY ASS.

12:56.692 --> 12:59.695
- WELCOME TO THIS WEEK'S
ELIMINATION TATTOO.

12:59.778 --> 13:01.989
NAIL IT AND YOU'LL HAVE
ONE MORE WEEK TO PROVE

13:02.072 --> 13:06.160
THAT YOU DESERVE $100,000,
A FEATURE IN <i> INKED</i> MAGAZINE,

13:06.243 --> 13:08.662
AND THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.332
YOU'LL BE JUDGED
BY OLIVER PECK, CHRIS NUÑEZ,

13:11.415 --> 13:12.041
AND MYSELF,

13:12.124 --> 13:14.793
BUT WE'RE NOT YOUR ONLY CRITICS.

13:14.877 --> 13:17.713
EACH WEEK YOU'LL ALSO
BE JUDGED BY AMERICA.

13:17.796 --> 13:20.299
VIEWERS AT HOME
WILL SCOUR EVERY DETAIL

13:20.382 --> 13:24.470
OF YOUR ELIMINATION TATTOOS
AT INKMASTER.SPIKE.COM

13:24.553 --> 13:27.556
AND VOTE FOR THE TATTOO
THAT THEY THINK IS THE BEST.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.392
AMERICA'S VOTE
WILL HAVE A MASSIVE IMPACT

13:30.476 --> 13:32.228
AT THE LIVE FINALE.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.522
WE ALSO HAVE A VERY SPECIAL
GUEST JUDGE.

13:34.605 --> 13:35.731
TATTOOING FOR OVER 25 YEARS,

13:35.814 --> 13:40.778
HE SPECIALIZES
IN BIOMECHANICAL TATTOOS.

13:42.696 --> 13:43.572
AARON CAIN.

13:43.656 --> 13:47.743
- [laughing]
- YEAH. YEAH.

13:47.826 --> 13:52.248
- THE STYLE OF BIOMECH THAT I DO
IS GRAPHIC AND ILLUSTRATIVE.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.499
{\an8}TATTOOING SHOULDN'T BE
JUST A JOB.

13:53.582 --> 13:55.501
{\an8}IT SHOULD BE YOUR PASSION.

13:55.584 --> 13:59.255
{\an8}- HOLY [bleep], AARON CAIN
IS MY ICON IN THIS INDUSTRY.

13:59.338 --> 13:59.880
{\an8}HELL YEAH.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.549
I LOOK UP TO THE GUY,

14:01.632 --> 14:03.259
AND TO IMPRESS HIM
IS GONNA BE REALLY HARD.

14:03.342 --> 14:03.801
- THANKS FOR JOINING US.

14:03.884 --> 14:04.593
- NICE TO SEE YOU.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.012
- THAT GAVE ME GOOSE BUMPS.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.848
- THIS WEEK,
WE'RE TESTING DETAIL.

14:09.932 --> 14:11.767
{\an8}- DETAIL IS ALL THE LITTLE
TEXTURES,

14:11.850 --> 14:13.519
{\an8}ALL THE LITTLE FINE LINES
AND SHADING

14:13.602 --> 14:15.312
{\an8}THAT BRINGS A TATTOO TO LIFE.

14:15.396 --> 14:19.358
- TODAY YOU MUST ALL CREATE...

14:19.441 --> 14:21.610
A BIOMECHANICAL TATTOO.

14:21.694 --> 14:22.695
- [exhales tensely]

14:22.778 --> 14:25.197
- DAMN.
- AND HE'S GONNA JUDGE IT.

14:25.281 --> 14:26.282
- THAT'S THE SCARY PART.
- [bleep].

14:26.365 --> 14:29.618
{\an8}- HAVING THE GODFATHER
OF BIOMECH JUDGE MY TATTOOS,

14:29.702 --> 14:30.452
{\an8}IT PUTS SO MUCH PRESSURE ON YOU.

14:30.536 --> 14:33.706
{\an8}- I DON'T DO BIOMECHANICAL.

14:33.789 --> 14:36.292
{\an8}I'M ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED
RIGHT NOW.

14:38.335 --> 14:42.131
{\an8}- BIOMECHANICAL TATTOOS ARE
FREE-FLOWING FORMS THAT EITHER

14:42.214 --> 14:45.759
{\an8}GROW OR COME TOGETHER
IN A MECHANICAL, ORGANIC WAY.

14:45.843 --> 14:48.804
{\an8}- DETAIL IS REALLY IMPORTANT
IN BIOMECHANICAL TATTOOS

14:48.887 --> 14:51.140
{\an8}BECAUSE IT ENHANCES
ALL THE LITTLE TINY CREVICES

14:51.223 --> 14:53.767
{\an8}AND GIVES IT THAT POP TO MAKE IT
THAT MUCH MORE EXCITING.

14:53.851 --> 14:55.269
{\an8}- LET'S MEET YOUR CANVASES.

15:00.899 --> 15:03.444
{\an8}AARON,
YOU WON THE FLASH CHALLENGE.

15:03.527 --> 15:07.156
{\an8}YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES.

15:07.239 --> 15:11.660
{\an8}THIS COMPETITION IS GETTING
TIGHTER, SO BE RUTHLESS.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.162
{\an8}- AT THIS POINT,
I'VE MADE IT MY MISSION

15:13.245 --> 15:14.079
{\an8}TO KNOCK DOWN THE LEAD ARTISTS

15:14.163 --> 15:16.415
{\an8}JUST TO GET THEM
OUT OF THE FRIGGING WAY

15:16.498 --> 15:17.458
{\an8}SO THAT I CAN MOVE FORWARD.

15:17.541 --> 15:18.334
{\an8}WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING
TO GET DONE?

15:18.417 --> 15:20.169
- BIOMECHANICAL HEART
ON MY RIBS.

15:20.252 --> 15:23.297
- LOOKING TO GET MECHANICAL
GEARS ON MY RIBS RIGHT HERE.

15:23.380 --> 15:25.174
- NICE.
- NO RIBS.

15:25.257 --> 15:26.967
- LOOKING TO GET BIOMECHANICAL
WITH GEARS ON MY RIBS.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.927
- I HOPE I DON'T GET
ANY OF THESE RIB CANVASES.

15:29.011 --> 15:31.055
{\an8}I DON'T NEED SOMEONE
SQUIRMING AROUND IN TONS OF PAIN

15:31.138 --> 15:33.015
{\an8}WHILE I'M TRYING
TO DO SOME DETAILED BIOMECH.

15:33.098 --> 15:36.143
{\an8}- YOU'RE NOT GETTING
YOUR [bleep] RIBS DONE.

15:36.226 --> 15:38.312
{\an8}- I'M LOOKING TO GET
BIOMECHANICAL GEARS

15:38.395 --> 15:40.814
{\an8}GOING ALL THE WAY
TO THE BACK OF MY SKULL.

15:40.898 --> 15:43.108
{\an8}- YOU SCREW UP SOMEBODY'S
NOGGIN, YOU'RE GOING HOME.

15:43.192 --> 15:47.237
{\an8}- I'M LOOKING TO GET
BIOMECHANICAL GEARS ON MY BUTT.

15:47.321 --> 15:50.032
{\an8}- OH.
- YET ANOTHER GLUTE TATTOO.

15:50.115 --> 15:53.118
{\an8}IF I SEE ONE MORE PERSON'S BUTT,

15:53.202 --> 15:55.412
{\an8}IT WILL BE WAY TOO [bleep] SOON.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.168
{\an8}- HANDS IN THE AIR,
WHO WANTS RIB TATTOOS?

16:04.797 --> 16:06.131
{\an8}- IF AARON'S GOT A HALF A BRAIN,

16:06.215 --> 16:08.550
{\an8}HE'S GONNA GIVE THE GUYS
AT THE TOP, LIKE MYSELF,

16:08.634 --> 16:10.010
{\an8}THE TOUGHEST CANVASES.

16:10.094 --> 16:12.846
I REALLY DON'T CARE.
I'LL KNOCK IT OUT OF THE PARK.

16:17.393 --> 16:18.560
- CANVASES, ONE BY ONE,

16:18.644 --> 16:21.772
PLEASE READ THE ARTIST'S NAME
ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SKULL.

16:21.855 --> 16:23.649
- JULIA.

16:23.732 --> 16:25.609
- ANGEL.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.152
- DON.

16:27.236 --> 16:30.781
{\an8}- BIOMECHANICAL HEART TATTOO
ON HER RIBS--I'M SCREWED.

16:39.415 --> 16:40.874
{\an8}- JOSH.

16:40.958 --> 16:43.377
{\an8}- IT WOULD BE STUPID FOR AARON
NOT TO GUN FOR ME.

16:43.460 --> 16:44.670
{\an8}I AM THE TOP DOG IN THE HOUSE,

16:44.753 --> 16:46.422
{\an8}AND I AM THE ONE TO AIM AT.

16:46.505 --> 16:47.589
- ERIK.

16:51.468 --> 16:54.638
- CRIS.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.473
- EMILY.

17:01.937 --> 17:04.021
- AARON.

17:04.106 --> 17:04.732
- OH.
THE HEAD.

17:04.815 --> 17:06.942
- I LOVE IT.
I'M EXCITED.

17:07.025 --> 17:08.777
IT'S TATTOO TIME.
NO MORE BULL[bleep].

17:08.861 --> 17:09.694
{\an8}I'VE GOT TO PROVE
THAT I'M WORTH STAYING HERE.

17:09.778 --> 17:12.114
{\an8}- AARON'S AN IDIOT.

17:12.196 --> 17:14.450
{\an8}IT IS SO DIFFICULT
TATTOOING ON A SKULL.

17:14.532 --> 17:18.119
- CLEEN ROCK ONE.

17:18.203 --> 17:19.913
- MARK.
- THAT'S I.

17:19.997 --> 17:22.499
- JASON.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.792
- REMEMBER, ARTISTS,
AFTER THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

17:24.877 --> 17:26.837
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
WILL VOTE ON THE TATTOO

17:26.920 --> 17:29.048
THAT THEY THINK IS THE WORST

17:29.131 --> 17:31.175
AND PUT ONE ARTIST UP
FOR ELIMINATION.

17:31.258 --> 17:32.843
YOU'LL HAVE SIX HOURS

17:32.926 --> 17:36.013
TO CREATE A DETAILED
BIOMECHANICAL TATTOO.

17:36.096 --> 17:41.101
BASED ON YOUR WORK,
ONE OF YOU WILL CLOSE SHOP.

17:41.185 --> 17:42.311
GOOD LUCK.

17:42.394 --> 17:43.645
- BIOMECHANICAL TATTOOING IS

17:43.729 --> 17:46.315
A VERY HEAVILY DETAIL-ORIENTED
GENRE.

17:46.398 --> 17:47.566
{\an8}- HOW'S IT GOING?

17:47.649 --> 17:49.651
{\an8}- IT TAKES SMALL,
LITTLE INTRICATE DETAILS,

17:49.735 --> 17:51.153
{\an8}REPETITIVE PATTERNS,
AND A LOT OF LAYERS

17:51.236 --> 17:54.740
{\an8}TO MAKE THESE THINGS
LOOK LIKE THEY COULD BE ALIVE.

17:54.823 --> 17:56.325
- IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING
THAT I CAN COMPLETE

17:56.408 --> 17:58.368
AT A HIGH LEVEL IN SIX HOURS.
- OKAY.

17:58.452 --> 18:00.162
- WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT
WHERE IT'S GONNA GO,

18:00.245 --> 18:01.497
YOU PICKED THE ONE AREA

18:01.580 --> 18:06.335
IS NOT SOMETHING
THAT IS POSSIBLE TO DO THAT TO.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.378
- I WANT A METAL PLATE
THAT BOLTS,

18:08.462 --> 18:09.755
LIKE A PCB CIRCUIT BOARD.

18:09.838 --> 18:11.048
- SOME OF THE STUFF YOU WANT

18:11.131 --> 18:13.008
WILL NOT WORK
FOR THIS CHALLENGE.

18:13.091 --> 18:16.011
{\an8}IF I GIVE MY CANVAS
THE TATTOO THAT HE WANTS,

18:16.095 --> 18:17.930
{\an8}I'M GOING HOME TODAY.

18:18.013 --> 18:20.015
- I DEFINITELY WANT
THE MACHINE SCREWS.

18:20.098 --> 18:21.141
YOU KNOW,
LIKE A REAL ROBOT.

18:21.225 --> 18:22.851
- THAT'S NOT CONSIDERED
BIOMECHANICAL.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.019
- SURE IT IS. OF COURSE IT IS.
ANYTHING--

18:24.102 --> 18:25.854
- WHAT I SHOWED YOU--
IT'S CONSIDERED MECHANICAL...

18:25.938 --> 18:26.939
- RIGHT, BIOMECHANICAL.
- BUT NOT BIOMECHANICAL.

18:27.022 --> 18:29.942
I'M NOT GOING
TO RISK MY LIVELIHOOD

18:30.025 --> 18:32.069
FOR YOUR STUPID TATTOO IDEA

18:32.152 --> 18:34.488
THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE CHALLENGE.

18:34.571 --> 18:36.698
IF WE DO NOT FOLLOW
THE CHALLENGE,

18:36.782 --> 18:37.699
IT'LL SEND ME HOME.

18:37.783 --> 18:40.035
- I WANT, LIKE, MACHINE PARTS.

18:40.118 --> 18:42.162
LIKE, THE SKIN RIPPING OPEN,
IT'S MACHINE UNDERNEATH.

18:42.246 --> 18:43.622
- [bleep] ME, MAN.

18:43.705 --> 18:46.083
WHAT IF I CREATE A COMBINATION
OF THE ORGANICS WITH MACHINERY?

18:46.166 --> 18:49.378
{\an8}MY CANVAS WANTS JUST
STRAIGHT MECHANICAL.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.046
I'M GONNA TAKE THAT CONCEPT
AND TRY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

18:51.129 --> 18:53.674
- YEAH.
- LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN CREATE.

18:53.757 --> 18:54.883
WE'RE GONNA
WORK TOGETHER ON THIS

18:54.967 --> 18:58.720
UNTIL WE COME UP WITH A DESIGN.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.264
- ROBOTS ARE NOT BIOMECHANICAL.

19:00.347 --> 19:01.515
WHAT I SHOWED YOU ORIGINALLY--

19:01.598 --> 19:03.392
- ARE ROBOTS MECHANICAL OR NOT?
YES.

19:03.475 --> 19:04.768
- BUT IF YOU DON'T MEET THE
CHALLENGE, AND IF YOU GO OFF--

19:04.852 --> 19:06.770
- IT MEETS THE CHALLENGE.

19:06.854 --> 19:08.897
- CAN YOU LET ME FINISH?

19:08.981 --> 19:10.732
{\an8}MY CANVAS
IS A STRAIGHT-UP ASS[bleep].

19:10.816 --> 19:12.276
YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME RESPECT
RIGHT NOW.

19:12.359 --> 19:13.527
- I'M TRYING TO BE RESPECTFUL,

19:13.610 --> 19:14.862
BUT YOU'RE NOT COMPROMISING.

19:14.945 --> 19:16.154
- YOU'RE JUST TELLING ME
WHAT TO DO.

19:16.238 --> 19:17.531
- I'M WILLING TO MOVE
A LITTLE BIT,

19:17.614 --> 19:20.117
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO COME
AND MOVE WITH ME TOO.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.243
- I'M GETTING SO FRUSTRATED.

19:21.326 --> 19:22.536
- YOU'RE GETTING FRUSTRATED?

19:22.619 --> 19:25.330
- THIS GUY IS NOT RECEPTIVE
AT ALL.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.124
HE'S STRESSING ME OUT SO BAD.

19:27.207 --> 19:27.916
- YOU COULD DO THAT STYLE SOME,
BUT--

19:28.000 --> 19:31.086
- THE CHALLENGE IS THIS STYLE,

19:31.169 --> 19:35.674
SO HOW CAN I DO IT "SOME"
IF THE CHALLENGE IS THIS STYLE?

19:35.757 --> 19:37.968
GIVE ME SOME DIRECTION OR GO.
- PUNCH IN SOME--

19:38.051 --> 19:39.678
- DON'T BE LIKE,
"PUNCH IN SOME, UH, UH."

19:39.761 --> 19:41.763
{\an8}MY CHILDREN
ARE DEPENDING ON ME RIGHT NOW,

19:41.847 --> 19:44.141
{\an8}AND HIS THINGS
HE WANTS IN THIS TATTOO

19:44.224 --> 19:44.850
{\an8}ARE GOING TO SEND ME HOME,

19:44.933 --> 19:47.769
{\an8}AND I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.771
YOU NEED TO GO
SO I CAN GET TO WORK.

19:49.855 --> 19:52.316
- RIGHT,
BUT I WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU'RE--

19:52.399 --> 19:53.233
- GO.

20:06.163 --> 20:08.290
- HOW YOU DOING?
- ALL RIGHT.

20:08.373 --> 20:10.626
SO THIS IS
WHAT I'VE COME UP WITH.

20:10.709 --> 20:14.338
I GOT THE CABLES COMING AROUND,
AND THEN WE HAVE THE BIO PART,

20:14.421 --> 20:16.632
WHICH IS
WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR.

20:16.715 --> 20:21.345
AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, I'M
JUST GONNA TATTOO IT ON MYSELF.

20:21.428 --> 20:22.804
- YEAH,
I'M NOT REALLY FEELING IT.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.973
- ALL RIGHT, GO ON.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.099
- I MEAN, IT'S JUST NOTHING--

20:26.183 --> 20:29.102
- PEACE. BYE.
- IT'S MY TATTOO.

20:29.186 --> 20:31.855
IT'S ON MY BODY,
SO I WANT IDEAS THAT I HAD TOO.

20:31.939 --> 20:34.191
{\an8}I'M TRYING TO WORK WITH HER,

20:34.274 --> 20:37.194
{\an8}AND SHE'S NOT WILLING
TO WORK WITH ME NOT ONE BIT.

20:37.277 --> 20:38.987
ARE YOU WILLING
TO COMPROMISE A LITTLE BIT?

20:39.071 --> 20:40.489
- NO.

20:40.572 --> 20:42.616
- 'CAUSE YOU REALLY DIDN'T PUT
ANYTHING THAT I WANTED INTO IT.

20:42.699 --> 20:43.659
- I PUT CABLES AND METAL
IN THERE.

20:43.742 --> 20:44.826
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. I GOT IT.

20:44.910 --> 20:45.994
- YOU DON'T WANT TO COMPROMISE
AT ALL.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.163
I'M TATTOOING MYSELF.
- I COMPROMISED A LOT ON THIS.

20:48.246 --> 20:49.373
- YOU DIDN'T COMPROMISE
FOR [bleep].

20:49.456 --> 20:50.832
- AND I REALLY WANT YOU TO DO
A GREAT TATTOO.

20:50.916 --> 20:54.169
- NO, YOU DON'T. YOU KEPT SAYING
ALL KINDS OF STUPID [bleep].

20:54.252 --> 20:55.504
I'M NOT PUTTING PISTONS ON--

20:55.587 --> 20:57.422
- I DIDN'T WANT A [bleep]
PISTON, I SAID YOU--

20:57.506 --> 20:58.757
- PLATES AND CABLES.
- NO, NO, NO.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.467
I DIDN'T SAY--I SAID SOME METAL.
- GOOD-BYE.

21:00.550 --> 21:02.469
- I SAID, LIKE, METAL RODS.
- HAVE A NICE LIFE.

21:02.552 --> 21:04.304
GO [bleep] YOURSELF.

21:09.309 --> 21:11.645
{\an8}- JULIA TURNED INTO
A TOTAL INSANE PERSON.

21:11.728 --> 21:13.522
IF SHE CAN'T TREAT PEOPLE
WITH RESPECT,

21:13.605 --> 21:16.483
SHE SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

21:16.566 --> 21:21.238
- YOU HAVE SIX HOURS TO CREATE
A BIOMECHANICAL TATTOO.

21:21.321 --> 21:25.200
YOUR TIME BEGINS NOW.

21:25.283 --> 21:26.410
- LET'S DO IT.
- LET'S DO IT.

21:26.493 --> 21:27.953
- ALL RIGHT, YEAH.

21:28.036 --> 21:30.580
{\an8}- THESE TATTOOS NEED
A CRAZY AMOUNTS OF DETAIL

21:30.664 --> 21:33.667
{\an8}TO COME TO LIFE--RIBBING,
PIPING, BONE MATTER.

21:33.750 --> 21:36.211
IF SOMEBODY CAN'T DELIVER,
THEY GOTTA GO.

21:36.294 --> 21:37.754
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.633
- MM-MM.

21:41.717 --> 21:42.217
- YOU AWAKE?
- MM-HMM.

21:42.300 --> 21:44.136
- JUST MAKING SURE.

21:44.219 --> 21:46.680
{\an8}NO ONE IN THIS CHALLENGE
HAS A CHANCE AGAINST ME TODAY.

21:46.763 --> 21:49.516
{\an8}I'M MAKING THIS HEAD TATTOO
BIG, BOLD, DARK,

21:49.599 --> 21:51.101
{\an8}AND JUST BAD-ASS,
BUT I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING,

21:51.184 --> 21:53.895
{\an8}AND I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

21:53.979 --> 21:56.940
{\an8}- YOU HAVE FIVE HOURS REMAINING.

22:04.072 --> 22:05.157
{\an8}- I DON'T WANT TO TATTOO MYSELF,

22:05.240 --> 22:08.118
{\an8}BUT AT THIS POINT
I HAVE NO CHOICE.

22:08.201 --> 22:11.329
I'M NOT GOING TO LET
SOME ASS[bleep] BE RESPONSIBLE

22:11.413 --> 22:12.748
FOR ME GOING HOME TODAY.

22:12.831 --> 22:13.749
- LET'S SEE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE.

22:13.832 --> 22:16.585
IS THIS THE DESIGN
THAT THE GUY DIDN'T WANT?

22:16.668 --> 22:18.920
- HE DIDN'T WANT
ANY OF THE BIOMECHANICAL IN IT.

22:19.004 --> 22:21.548
HE JUST WANTED ONLY MECHANICAL.
- OKAY.

22:21.631 --> 22:23.842
- SO IT WOULDN'T HAVE MET
THE CHALLENGE.

22:23.925 --> 22:26.136
I KNOW I HAVE TO DO THIS
FOR MY CHILDREN.

22:26.219 --> 22:28.263
I HAVE EVERYTHING
ON THE LINE RIGHT NOW.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.188
- SO WHAT'S YOUR TAKE?
DID YOU HEAR ANY OF THAT?

22:36.271 --> 22:38.774
- SHE WAS JUST GOING OFF
ON THE GUY, YOU KNOW, SO...

22:38.857 --> 22:40.108
- WOULD YOU HAVE
BOUNCED THAT GUY?

22:40.192 --> 22:42.527
- NO, I WOULD HAVE GAVE HIM
EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTED.

22:42.611 --> 22:43.612
{\an8}JULIA'S A DUMBASS.

22:43.695 --> 22:45.781
SHE SHOULD HAVE JUST
TATTOOED HER CANVAS,

22:45.864 --> 22:47.616
BUT I THINK HER ART ABILITIES
CAUGHT UP TO HER,

22:47.699 --> 22:50.827
AND SHE COULDN'T PROVIDE
WHAT HE WANTED.

22:50.911 --> 22:52.788
- THREE HOURS REMAINING,
EVERYBODY.

22:52.871 --> 22:54.539
- [bleep].

22:58.543 --> 23:01.338
- GETTING THIS,
TRYING TO MAKE PROGRESS.

23:01.421 --> 23:04.633
{\an8}I'M HERE TO WIN, GET MY MONEY,
AND GO HOME.

23:04.716 --> 23:07.177
WHEN MY MOTHER PASSED AWAY,
I WAS 17.

23:07.260 --> 23:08.804
SHE WAS STOLEN FROM ME

23:08.887 --> 23:10.472
BEFORE I EVEN SHOWED
HER MY FIRST TATTOO.

23:10.555 --> 23:12.974
HER MEMORY,
THAT'S WHAT'S KEEPING ME GOING.

23:13.058 --> 23:15.018
I NEED TO WIN THIS.

23:15.102 --> 23:16.436
- GONNA MAKE IT IN TIME?
- YEAH.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.980
WE HAD TO TRY
TO MEET EACH OTHER HALFWAY.

23:19.064 --> 23:19.898
I WAS GETTING SIDETRACKED

23:19.981 --> 23:21.525
WITH THE SITUATION
GOING ON OVER THERE.

23:21.608 --> 23:22.818
- YEAH, WHAT'D YOU HEAR
FROM OVER HERE?

23:22.901 --> 23:23.443
- WOW.

23:23.527 --> 23:24.361
ALL I HEARD WAS HER VOICE

23:24.444 --> 23:27.197
UP TO HERE
AND HIS VOICE OVER HERE,

23:27.280 --> 23:29.825
AND THEN HER VOICE
GOT OVER HERE.

23:29.908 --> 23:33.620
{\an8}- A BIG PART OF THIS COMPETITION
IS DEALING WITH YOUR CANVASES

23:33.703 --> 23:35.497
{\an8}AND GIVING THEM THE TATTOO
THAT THEY WANT,

23:35.580 --> 23:37.958
{\an8}SO IT'S A PRETTY BIG STRIKE
AGAINST YOU

23:38.041 --> 23:40.252
{\an8}IF YOU DON'T TATTOO YOUR CANVAS
AT ALL.

23:40.335 --> 23:42.504
- YOU KNOW AARON CAIN'S HERE,

23:42.587 --> 23:45.090
SO YOU BETTER TAKE YOUR TIME
ON A BIOMECH PIECE.

23:45.173 --> 23:46.299
- BE A GOOD IDEA.

23:46.383 --> 23:48.176
WHEN I DO A RIB TATTOO,
I ATTACK.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.010
{\an8}I GO AFTER IT.

23:49.094 --> 23:51.138
{\an8}I DO IT AS BIG AND BOLD
AS I CAN.

23:51.221 --> 23:52.681
I KNOW I'M A PROFICIENT,
SOLID TATTOOER.

23:52.764 --> 23:55.392
I'M TECHNICALLY SOUND, AND I'M
GONNA KICK SOME ASS TODAY.

23:55.475 --> 23:57.644
- IT'S A BIG PIECE,
ESPECIALLY ON THE RIBS.

23:59.855 --> 24:01.523
- ONE HOUR TO GO. FINAL HOUR.

24:05.443 --> 24:06.486
- OOF.

24:06.570 --> 24:09.197
- DOING ALL RIGHT?
- COULD SIT HERE ALL DAY.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.324
{\an8}- THE RIBS ARE A VERY DIFFICULT
AREA TO TATTOO,

24:11.408 --> 24:13.201
{\an8}AND I WANT TO SHOW OFF
THAT I CAN DO A CLEAN,

24:13.285 --> 24:15.203
{\an8}TECHNICAL TATTOO
ON A DIFFICULT SKIN.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.455
MY RIVAL'S STILL HERE.
I'VE BEEN IN THE BOTTOM.

24:17.539 --> 24:20.500
I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A TON
OF PRESSURE RIGHT NOW.

24:22.210 --> 24:23.712
- YOU NEED SOME THICKER LINES.

24:23.795 --> 24:24.713
- I'M EXCITED
TO SEE YOUR TATTOO.

24:24.796 --> 24:28.592
- I'M EXCITED TO SEE YOURS, PAL.
- THANKS, BUDDY.

24:28.675 --> 24:32.596
- TEN, NINE, EIGHT, SEVEN,

24:32.679 --> 24:35.515
SIX, FIVE, FOUR,

24:35.599 --> 24:37.017
THREE, TWO, ONE.

24:37.100 --> 24:39.561
THAT'S IT.
MACHINES DOWN.

24:39.644 --> 24:42.063
TIME IS UP.
NO MORE TATTOOING PLEASE.

24:42.147 --> 24:44.274
- CHECK IT OUT.

24:44.357 --> 24:45.775
- WOW, THE DETAIL'S UNREAL.

24:45.859 --> 24:48.528
THAT'S CRAZY.

24:48.612 --> 24:50.071
- [laughs]

24:50.155 --> 24:51.072
- THAT'S AWESOME.

24:51.156 --> 24:54.242
- MY TATTOO IS SO AWESOME.

24:54.326 --> 24:58.079
I REALLY SHOWED TODAY
THAT I DESERVE TO BE HERE.

24:58.163 --> 24:59.915
{\an8}- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, JULIA?

24:59.998 --> 25:01.917
YOU SENT YOUR CANVAS HOME.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.419
YOU TOLD THIS GIANT-ASS DUDE
TO EFF OFF.

25:04.502 --> 25:08.006
PLUS, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU DID A
COVER-UP ON YOUR OWN LEG, GIRL.

25:08.089 --> 25:09.925
YOU'RE GOING HOME.

25:10.008 --> 25:11.927
{\an8}- DON'T DIG IT DEEPER.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.386
{\an8}- QUIT SHAKING
YOUR [bleep] HEAD.

25:13.470 --> 25:15.096
{\an8}- DON'T TALK TO ME THAT WAY.

25:15.180 --> 25:17.057
- THERE ARE TWO SIDES
TO EVERY STORY.

25:27.317 --> 25:29.569
- I THINK THAT JULIA
COPPED OUT.

25:29.653 --> 25:31.238
SHE JUST WASN'T CAPABLE
AS AN ARTIST

25:31.321 --> 25:32.656
TO DRAW WHAT HE WANTED, SO...

25:32.739 --> 25:35.158
- THE CANVAS THAT I WAS DEALING
WITH WAS REALLY DIFFICULT,

25:35.242 --> 25:37.827
BUT WE MANAGED
TO MEET EACH OTHER HALFWAY.

25:37.911 --> 25:39.829
SO IF I WAS ABLE TO WORK
SOMETHING OUT WITH THIS GUY,

25:39.913 --> 25:41.998
I'M PRETTY SURE SHE COULD HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT TOO.

25:42.082 --> 25:45.126
- THAT'S WHAT I THINK.
I FEEL THAT--SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.

25:45.210 --> 25:46.002
- HEY, GUYS.
- WOW, WOW, WOW.

25:46.086 --> 25:48.046
- WHAT'S UP?
- WHAT'S UP, SQUEAKS?

25:48.129 --> 25:50.465
- NOT MUCH. I'M SUPER TIRED.

25:50.548 --> 25:53.093
- I THINK YOU COULD HAVE CAME UP
WITH SOMETHING

25:53.176 --> 25:54.135
TO TATTOO THE GUY.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.513
I WOULD HAVE DRAWN
EXACTLY WHAT THE GUY WANTED.

25:56.596 --> 25:58.223
- HE JUST WANTED METAL
AND CABLES.

25:58.306 --> 26:00.141
- I WAS LISTENING.
I HEARD EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTED.

26:00.225 --> 26:01.309
- BUT THIS GUY WOULD NOT BUDGE.
HE WOULDN'T BUDGE AT ALL.

26:01.393 --> 26:03.728
- NAH, I THINK YOU WERE JUST
TRYING TO GIVE HIM A STYLE

26:03.812 --> 26:05.021
THAT HE TOTALLY DIDN'T WANT.

26:05.105 --> 26:07.649
- NO, I WAS TRYING TO COMPROMISE
WITH HIM THE WHOLE TIME,

26:07.732 --> 26:09.150
AND HE'S A DISRESPECTFUL DICK
WHO'S UNWILLING TO COMPROMISE.

26:09.234 --> 26:11.319
- AFTER HE FOUND OUT

26:11.403 --> 26:13.113
THAT YOU WEREN'T GONNA GIVE HIM
WHAT HE WANTED.

26:13.196 --> 26:13.947
- I DID EVERYTHING I COULD.

26:14.030 --> 26:15.198
- I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

26:15.282 --> 26:16.741
YOU THINK SHE COPPED OUT?

26:16.825 --> 26:18.118
- IF YOU CAN SAY I COPPED OUT

26:18.201 --> 26:21.162
AFTER JUST TATTOOING MYSELF
FOR SIX HOURS--

26:21.246 --> 26:22.455
I DIDN'T WANT TO TATTOO MYSELF.

26:22.539 --> 26:24.332
I REALLY DID NOT WANT
TO DO THAT.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.293
THAT WAS THE LAST THING
I WANT TO DO.

26:39.055 --> 26:40.807
- TODAY,
ALL OF YOU WENT HEAD-TO-HEAD

26:40.890 --> 26:44.185
CREATING BIOMECHANICAL TATTOOS.

26:44.269 --> 26:48.648
DON, LET'S START WITH YOU.

26:48.732 --> 26:51.735
- THIS PIECE, OUT
OF ALL THE PIECES WE SEE TODAY,

26:51.818 --> 26:53.194
IS LACKING THE MOST DETAIL.

26:53.278 --> 26:54.904
- I ACTUALLY THINK
IT'S KIND OF POORLY DRAWN.

26:54.988 --> 26:56.531
I MEAN, IT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE A HEART, RIGHT?

26:56.614 --> 26:58.199
- I THOUGHT
IT LOOKED LIKE A HEART TO ME.

26:58.283 --> 27:00.994
- THERE'S SOME REALLY WEIRD
SHAPES THAT DON'T GO TOGETHER.

27:01.077 --> 27:02.454
IT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A FLOW.

27:02.537 --> 27:04.914
- THE FORMS THAT YOU HAVE
DON'T HAVE THE DETAIL IN THEM

27:04.998 --> 27:07.709
OR THE REPETITIVE IMAGES THAT
GIVE IT THAT MECHANICAL LOOK.

27:09.836 --> 27:11.379
- EMILY.

27:11.463 --> 27:13.548
- THIS IS A NICE, CLEAN TATTOO.

27:13.631 --> 27:16.384
IT'S KIND OF A DELICATE APPROACH
TO BIOMECH.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.219
I LIKE THE SYMMETRY
THAT YOU DID.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.555
THE TWO OPPOSING IMAGES,
THEY DO HAVE A NICE FLOW.

27:20.638 --> 27:22.140
- THIS IS ACTUALLY ONE
OF MY FAVORITES.

27:22.223 --> 27:25.393
THE SOFTNESS OF THE TWO PIECES
COMING TOGETHER AND THE WAY

27:25.477 --> 27:27.187
IT LOOKS LIKE JEWELRY,
I THINK IT'S REALLY NICE.

27:27.270 --> 27:29.356
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

27:31.024 --> 27:33.443
- JOSH.

27:33.526 --> 27:35.737
- OVERALL, IT WAS
A LITTLE BIT CLUNKY.

27:35.820 --> 27:38.615
THERE ARE THESE BIG SHAPES
JUST KIND OF FLOPPED IN THERE,

27:38.698 --> 27:40.325
BUT DEFINITELY A BIOMECH TATTOO.

27:40.408 --> 27:41.534
IT HAS A LOT OF DETAIL.

27:41.618 --> 27:42.786
IT'S GOT GOOD ELEMENTS TO IT.

27:42.869 --> 27:44.746
- THE SHADING
THAT YOU DID IN ALL

27:44.829 --> 27:46.539
OF YOUR BIG PIECES LOOKS GREAT.

27:46.623 --> 27:50.001
TECHNICALLY THE THING'S
REALLY NICE.

27:50.085 --> 27:54.255
- CRIS.

27:54.339 --> 27:56.716
- THE OVERALL FEEL OF THIS
TATTOO IS A LITTLE CONFUSING.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.636
- THERE'S TOO MUCH GOING ON
IN THAT SMALL OF AN AREA.

27:59.719 --> 28:02.430
IF THE SCALE WAS BIGGER, YOU
WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE SUCCESSFUL.

28:02.514 --> 28:06.684
I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE BIT
TOO MUCH DETAIL IN THIS ONE.

28:06.768 --> 28:08.686
- JASON.

28:08.770 --> 28:11.523
- THERE'S A COUPLE
OF REALLY STRONG TRICKS IN HERE

28:11.606 --> 28:13.191
USING OPPOSING
CONTRASTING COLORS.

28:13.274 --> 28:15.485
IT'S LIKE, "BANG, BANG."

28:15.568 --> 28:17.529
THAT MAKES IT DYNAMIC
IMMEDIATELY.

28:17.612 --> 28:18.196
- I THINK THE AMOUNT OF DETAIL
IS NICE.

28:18.279 --> 28:20.198
IT'S VERY LEGIBLE.

28:20.281 --> 28:23.159
OVERALL, I THINK
IT'S A WELL-DONE TATTOO.

28:23.243 --> 28:27.622
- ERIK.

28:27.705 --> 28:29.916
- MY FAVORITE PART OF THIS
TATTOO IS THE READABILITY.

28:29.999 --> 28:30.875
THE COMPOSITION
IS REALLY STRONG.

28:30.959 --> 28:33.795
YOU GOT THE BIOMECH ELEMENTS
JUST RIGHT.

28:33.878 --> 28:36.506
LIKE, THE CONTRAST YOU GOT FROM
THE MONOCHROMATIC BACKGROUND

28:36.589 --> 28:38.466
AND THEN THOSE RED ELEMENTS
IN THE FOREGROUND

28:38.550 --> 28:39.843
REALLY GIVES IT A PUNCH.

28:39.926 --> 28:41.469
OVERALL, GOOD WORK.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.596
- THANK YOU.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.558
- AARON.

28:46.641 --> 28:49.686
- AS FAR AS THE DETAIL, I DO
LIKE HOW THE GEARS ARE IN HERE.

28:49.769 --> 28:51.479
THE THING I DON'T LIKE ABOUT IT

28:51.563 --> 28:55.066
IS HOW OVERALL DARK
THE WHOLE TATTOO IS.

28:55.150 --> 28:55.650
- I KNEW THAT WAS COMING. YEAH.

28:55.733 --> 28:58.278
- YOU PUT SO MUCH WORK

28:58.361 --> 29:01.114
INTO MAKING THOSE GEARS
SO PERFECT AND CIRCULAR,

29:01.197 --> 29:05.076
{\an1}AND THEN YOU RAN SO MUCH BLACK
UP OVER IT, UNDER IT, AROUND IT,

29:05.160 --> 29:06.161
THAT YOU DELETED IT.

29:06.244 --> 29:08.246
YOU REALLY DID HAVE
THE RIGHT IDEA.

29:08.329 --> 29:11.207
I THINK IT JUST
GOT AWAY FROM YOU A LITTLE BIT.

29:11.291 --> 29:14.127
- MARK.

29:14.210 --> 29:16.004
- THERE'S A BUNCH
OF COOL ELEMENTS,

29:16.087 --> 29:19.215
BUT IT'S LIKE YOU GOT A BIG BOX
OF BIOMECH PARTS,

29:19.299 --> 29:21.217
AND YOU TRIED TO ARRANGE THEM
INSIDE OF THIS LITTLE

29:21.301 --> 29:22.719
PILL-SHAPED AREA THAT DOESN'T
REALLY FIT THE BODY.

29:22.802 --> 29:25.388
SO YOU HAVE
ALL THESE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS

29:25.472 --> 29:27.056
THAT ARE JUST
KIND OF PLUGGED TOGETHER,

29:27.140 --> 29:29.184
BUT THEY DON'T EVER FLOW
TOGETHER.

29:29.267 --> 29:34.105
IT'S JUST KIND OF JUMBLED
A LITTLE BIT.

29:34.189 --> 29:35.356
- ANGEL.

29:35.440 --> 29:38.651
- WHERE YOU FALL SHORT ON THIS,
MAN, IS AGAIN, LINE WORK.

29:38.735 --> 29:41.112
THAT CIRCLE IN THE JOINT
OF THE ELBOW,...

29:41.196 --> 29:42.447
- THAT WAS A PRETTY TRICKY SPOT.

29:42.530 --> 29:43.531
- IT'S PRETTY ROUGH.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.033
- THE CHALLENGE
THAT YOU'RE HAVING

29:45.116 --> 29:46.701
IS THE TECHNICAL EXECUTION SIDE,

29:46.784 --> 29:51.039
AND THAT IS A MAJOR HINDRANCE.

29:51.122 --> 29:54.292
- CLEEN.

29:54.375 --> 29:56.294
- YOU DIDN'T GO CRAZY
IN DETAILS,

29:56.377 --> 29:58.213
BUT THERE'S TREMENDOUS DETAIL
IN IT.

29:58.296 --> 29:59.547
YOU DID A LOT
OF REPETITIVE THINGS,

29:59.631 --> 30:02.050
ONLY THEY DON'T REPEAT
THEMSELVES.

30:02.133 --> 30:05.053
EACH SECTION
OF THE BEADS IS DIFFERENT.

30:05.136 --> 30:06.721
IT GIVES MORE OF
AN ARTISTIC FEEL.

30:06.804 --> 30:09.098
- I TRIED TO CHANGE UP
A LITTLE BIT AS I WENT

30:09.182 --> 30:10.517
JUST SO IT WASN'T SO STIFF.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.810
- THIS IS A STRONG TATTOO.
- THANKS.

30:12.894 --> 30:17.023
- JULIA.

30:17.106 --> 30:19.234
THERE WERE
SOME UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES

30:19.317 --> 30:20.902
WITH YOU AND YOUR CANVAS.

30:20.985 --> 30:22.904
BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT,
LET'S DISCUSS THE WORK

30:22.987 --> 30:24.531
THAT YOU HAVE PRESENTED FOR US.

30:24.614 --> 30:26.032
- THIS IS PROBABLY

30:26.115 --> 30:28.076
THE STRONGEST THING AS A JUDGE
I'VE SEEN YOU DO.

30:28.159 --> 30:30.411
IT HAS A LOT OF CONTRAST.
IT HAS A LOT OF DEPTH.

30:30.495 --> 30:31.704
- SO, JULIA,
NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT

30:31.788 --> 30:33.998
WHAT HAPPENED IN YOUR CONSULT.

30:34.082 --> 30:36.709
- I WAS TRYING REALLY HARD
TO BE VERY PATIENT,

30:36.793 --> 30:39.462
BUT THE GUY JUST
KEPT CUTTING ME OFF,

30:39.546 --> 30:40.421
AND I WAS JUST LIKE,
"I'M TRYING TO WORK WITH YOU.

30:40.505 --> 30:41.673
I'M TRYING TO DO WHAT YOU WANT."

30:41.756 --> 30:44.884
AND THEN AT ONE POINT
HE SHUSHED ME,

30:44.968 --> 30:46.511
SO I WAS JUST LIKE,
"LOOK, THIS IS THE DESIGN,

30:46.594 --> 30:49.222
"AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO
DO IT,

30:49.305 --> 30:50.807
I'M JUST GONNA TATTOO IT
ON MYSELF AT THIS POINT."

30:50.890 --> 30:53.726
- THERE ARE TWO SIDES
TO EVERY STORY.

30:53.810 --> 30:56.312
MAYBE WE SHOULD HEAR
FROM YOUR CANVAS.

31:04.237 --> 31:05.905
- BET YOU'RE NOT HAPPY
TO SEE ME.

31:05.989 --> 31:09.409
SHOULD I GO EFF OFF NOW?
- HEY, BUDDY.

31:09.492 --> 31:10.952
THANKS FOR JOINING US.
- NO PROBLEM.

31:11.035 --> 31:12.287
- WHAT IS YOUR SIDE
OF THE STORY?

31:12.370 --> 31:14.122
- SHE HATED EVERY IDEA
THAT I HAD.

31:14.205 --> 31:15.164
SHE SAID THEY WERE ALL CRAP.

31:15.248 --> 31:16.624
SHE SAID
THEY WERE ALL SO OUT THERE.

31:16.708 --> 31:17.584
- NO, I DIDN'T SAY
THEY WERE ALL CRAP.

31:17.667 --> 31:19.627
- SHE JUST SAID
I HAVE TO DO HER TATTOO,

31:19.711 --> 31:21.045
OR I WASN'T GETTING A TATTOO,

31:21.129 --> 31:23.381
AND I SAID, "WELL,
CAN'T YOU JUST CHANGE ANYTHING?"

31:23.464 --> 31:24.799
SHE'S LIKE,
"I WILL NOT CHANGE NOTHING."

31:24.882 --> 31:27.969
- I WAS ON THE COMPUTER
THE WHOLE TIME

31:28.052 --> 31:28.803
JUST LIKE, "WELL,
LET ME SHOW YOU THIS.

31:28.886 --> 31:31.055
LET ME SHOW YOU THIS,"
AND I WAS LIKE,

31:31.139 --> 31:32.807
"JUST TELL ME THE COMPONENTS
YOU WANT THEN"--

31:32.890 --> 31:34.976
- YEAH, BUT YOU WERE SUPER RUDE
ABOUT IT.

31:35.059 --> 31:37.270
- QUIT SHAKING
YOUR [bleep] HEAD.

31:37.353 --> 31:38.813
- DON'T TALK TO ME THAT WAY.

31:38.896 --> 31:40.815
- I HAVE NEVER, EVER SEEN

31:40.898 --> 31:44.861
ANY ARTIST TREAT A CUSTOMER
SO RUDELY AND TERRIBLY.

31:44.944 --> 31:48.156
WE HEARD YOUR SIDE, JULIA.
WE HEARD HIS SIDE.

31:48.239 --> 31:51.618
ALL OF US WATCHED 100%

31:51.701 --> 31:54.412
THE ENTIRE FOOTAGE
OF EVERY MINUTE

31:54.495 --> 31:55.580
THAT Y'ALL TWO WERE TOGETHER.

31:55.663 --> 31:57.665
HIS SIDE IS ALMOST
SPOT-ON THE TRUTH.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.917
YOUR SIDE IS SPIN-DOCTORED
TO HELL.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.005
- YOU TOLD HIM TO GO
[bleep] HIMSELF--

32:04.088 --> 32:08.217
UNPROVOKEDLY TOLD HIM
TO GO [bleep] HIMSELF.

32:08.301 --> 32:09.844
- YOU HAVE TO ALWAYS WORK
WITH THAT CLIENT

32:09.927 --> 32:12.180
OR STARVE AND NOT FEED
YOUR FAMILY.

32:12.263 --> 32:13.514
- EXACTLY.
- OKAY?

32:13.598 --> 32:14.849
'CAUSE THAT IS
HOW WE MAKE OUR MONEY

32:14.932 --> 32:16.225
IS WORKING WITH OUR CLIENTS.

32:16.309 --> 32:18.645
- EVERYONE THAT KNOWS ME AS
AN ARTIST KNOWS HOW I AM, AND--

32:18.728 --> 32:20.688
- LISTEN, JUST STOP.
STOP.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.148
DON'T DIG IT DEEPER.

32:22.231 --> 32:23.524
- MARK, THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
MAN.

32:23.608 --> 32:27.111
GOOD LUCK, BUDDY.
- THANK YOU.

32:29.530 --> 32:31.449
- [bleep].

32:31.532 --> 32:32.659
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S POLL THE JUDGES

32:32.742 --> 32:34.702
AND AWARD TATTOO OF THE DAY.

32:34.786 --> 32:37.288
- I REALLY LIKE JASON'S DESIGN.

32:37.372 --> 32:40.667
THAT STANDS OUT TO ME ACROSS
THE ROOM AS, "THAT'S BIOMECH."

32:40.750 --> 32:42.585
- I LIKE ERIK'S.
I MEAN, IT'S EXECUTED WELL.

32:42.669 --> 32:44.295
IF YOU WANT TO TALK DETAIL,
I WOULD SAY

32:44.379 --> 32:46.047
CLEEN PROBABLY HAD
THE BEST DETAIL.

32:46.130 --> 32:46.881
- WHAT I LIKE ABOUT
CLEEN'S TATTOO IS,

32:46.964 --> 32:49.092
EVEN THOUGH
HE DID A RIGID DESIGN,

32:49.175 --> 32:51.886
HE WAS SMART ENOUGH TO JUST
MAKE IT FREE-FLOWING.

32:51.969 --> 32:52.887
- FINAL DECISION?

32:52.970 --> 32:53.388
- I'M GONNA GO WITH JASON.

32:53.471 --> 32:54.555
- I THINK ERIK.

32:54.639 --> 32:56.599
- I'M GOING WITH CLEEN.

32:56.683 --> 32:58.851
- AND I'M GOING WITH CLEEN.

32:58.935 --> 33:01.729
- THE WINNER OF THE BEST TATTOO
OF THE DAY IS CLEEN.

33:01.813 --> 33:02.855
- THANK YOU.

33:02.939 --> 33:05.775
- THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
IS DELIBERATING RIGHT NOW,

33:05.858 --> 33:09.654
AND THEIR VOTE WILL PUT
ONE ARTIST UP FOR ELIMINATION.

33:09.737 --> 33:10.488
HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT,
AND WE'LL CALL YOU BACK

33:10.571 --> 33:12.824
WHEN WE HAVE A DECISION.

33:16.661 --> 33:17.787
- YOU DID TATTOO YOURSELF.

33:17.870 --> 33:19.455
IT WASN'T BECAUSE
YOU HAD A BAD CANVAS.

33:19.539 --> 33:20.665
IT WAS BECAUSE YOU
HAVE A BAD ATTITUDE.

33:20.748 --> 33:22.125
- EVERYBODY HAS LAPSES.

33:22.208 --> 33:23.584
- YOU CAN'T LOSE CONTROL
LIKE THAT.

33:23.668 --> 33:25.002
- I CAME HERE TO MAKE
MY LIFE BETTER.

33:25.086 --> 33:26.087
I NEED TO BE HERE.

33:26.170 --> 33:29.340
IT WAS A FLUKE AND
A MOMENTARY LAPSE IN CHARACTER

33:29.424 --> 33:31.676
THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.

33:31.759 --> 33:34.595
- NEVER IN MY LIFE,
IN MY SHOP, ANYWHERE,

33:34.679 --> 33:37.807
HAVE I EVER TOLD A PERSON
TO "GO [bleep] YOURSELF."

33:37.890 --> 33:39.100
NEVER. IT'S DISGUSTING.

33:39.183 --> 33:42.437
- I HAD A LAPSE
WHICH COULD HAPPEN TO ANYBODY.

33:42.520 --> 33:43.438
IT'S A LOT TO TAKE IN.

33:43.521 --> 33:44.272
- IT WOULD NEVER,
EVER HAPPEN TO ME.

33:44.355 --> 33:46.190
- KNOWING THAT
YOU'RE GONNA GO HOME

33:46.274 --> 33:48.317
TO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
WITH TWO KIDS.

33:48.401 --> 33:49.444
NO HOUSE, NOTHING.

33:49.527 --> 33:51.237
- I HAVE THE SAME THING
WITH THREE KIDS, SO...

33:51.320 --> 33:52.613
- YOU HAVE A HOUSE,
AND YOUR WIFE HAS A JOB.

33:52.697 --> 33:53.906
- DO I? DO I?
- AND SHE'S STILL WITH YOU.

33:53.990 --> 33:54.615
- OH, THE HOUSE
THAT I LIVE IN WITH MY PARENTS?

33:54.699 --> 33:56.659
I LOST MY HOUSE.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.035
I JUST HAD TO MOVE IN
WITH MY PARENTS

33:58.119 --> 33:59.454
WITH MY THREE KIDS,

33:59.537 --> 34:01.789
BUT I DIDN'T COME HERE TO WIN
$100,000 TO FIX MY PROBLEMS.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.332
- I'VE BEEN,
FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS,

34:03.416 --> 34:04.792
SUPPORTING MY FAMILY ALONE...
- ME TOO.

34:04.876 --> 34:07.295
- BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE WILL.
- ME TOO.

34:07.378 --> 34:08.463
- AND I'M MISSING MY KIDS

34:08.545 --> 34:10.005
GROWING UP
BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS AT WORK.

34:10.089 --> 34:10.547
- ME TOO.

34:10.630 --> 34:15.469
IT'S NOT ALL YOU.

34:15.553 --> 34:17.013
- BE A [bleep] HUMAN.
- I AM HUMAN.

34:17.096 --> 34:19.556
- YOU'RE NOT BEING HUMAN
AT ALL RIGHT NOW.

34:19.639 --> 34:23.311
YOU'RE BEING A DICK.
- [bleep] THIS.

34:23.393 --> 34:25.271
I'M NOT BEING ACCUSED OF
STUPID [bleep].

34:37.742 --> 34:39.284
- ALL RIGHT,
TODAY WE'RE TESTING DETAIL

34:39.368 --> 34:41.078
WITH BIOMECHANICAL TATTOOS.

34:41.161 --> 34:42.330
LET'S START WITH ANGEL.

34:42.413 --> 34:43.915
- THIS THING IS A MESS.

34:43.998 --> 34:47.710
THESE GEARS AND PISTONS
ARE REALLY SLOPPY.

34:47.793 --> 34:49.085
- WHO ELSE IS IN THE BOTTOM?

34:49.170 --> 34:50.670
- I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY DON.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.172
THIS TATTOO'S POORLY DRAWN,

34:52.255 --> 34:53.632
AND IT'S POORLY EXECUTED.

34:53.716 --> 34:55.927
- IN TERMS OF OVERALL
BIOMECHANICAL AND DETAIL,

34:56.010 --> 34:57.845
NOT A LOT OF EITHER IN THERE.

34:57.929 --> 34:58.888
- RIGHT, EXACTLY.

34:58.971 --> 34:59.931
- JULIA.

35:00.014 --> 35:01.307
TALKING ABOUT JUST THE TATTOO

35:01.390 --> 35:05.186
AND NOT THE SITUATION
WITH THE CANVAS, HOW DID SHE DO?

35:05.269 --> 35:08.022
- SOME OF HER SHADING IS CLEANER
THAN ANYTHING WE'VE SEEN HER DO.

35:08.105 --> 35:10.441
- HONESTLY, THIS IS ONE
OF HER NICEST TATTOOS.

35:10.525 --> 35:11.526
THIS IS A STRONG OUTLINE
FROM HER,

35:11.609 --> 35:14.904
AND I DON'T BELIEVE THE TATTOO
SHE DID ON HER OWN LEG

35:14.987 --> 35:16.823
IS THE WORST TATTOO IN THE ROOM
TODAY.

35:16.906 --> 35:19.659
- WE'VE HAD CANVASES
LEAVE BEFORE

35:19.742 --> 35:20.535
AND REFUSE TO GET TATTOOED,

35:20.618 --> 35:23.621
BUT WE'VE NEVER HAD AN ARTIST
TELL ONE

35:23.704 --> 35:26.707
TO GO [bleep] THEMSELVES
AND REFUSE TO DO A TATTOO.

35:26.791 --> 35:27.792
- WHAT BUMS ME OUT ABOUT IT

35:27.875 --> 35:29.919
IS THE UTTER DISRESPECT
THAT SHE SHOWED THAT GUY.

35:30.002 --> 35:31.212
- IF SHE WORKED AT MY SHOP

35:31.295 --> 35:33.339
AND TOLD SOME CUSTOMER
TO GO [bleep] THEMSELVES,

35:33.422 --> 35:35.174
SHE'S [bleep] PACKING
HER [bleep].

35:35.258 --> 35:36.384
- HELL YEAH.

35:36.467 --> 35:38.261
- SHE'S CERTAINLY
ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK FOR SURE.

35:38.344 --> 35:41.055
WE ALSO HAVE THE HUMAN CANVAS
JURY VOTING FOR THE TATTOO

35:41.138 --> 35:42.390
THAT THEY THINK IS THE WORST.

35:42.473 --> 35:45.059
IT'S GONNA BE INTERESTING TO SEE
HOW THAT PANS OUT.

35:45.143 --> 35:50.106
{\an8}- WE'RE HERE TO DETERMINE WHO
HAD THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

35:50.189 --> 35:52.233
- THAT'S MY TATTOO.
MY ARTIST WAS ERIK.

35:52.316 --> 35:54.735
HE PUT WAY TOO MUCH
OF THAT GREEN COLOR IN THERE.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.112
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE
DONE THAT AT ALL.

35:56.195 --> 35:58.239
- IT LOOKS TOO AQUATIC TO ME.
- EXACTLY.

35:58.322 --> 36:01.158
- HIS LINE WORK WAS GOOD
EXCEPT FOR THE GEARS.

36:01.242 --> 36:05.163
- ONLY FOR THE GEARS IS
WHERE IT REALLY GETS PRETTY BAD.

36:05.246 --> 36:06.122
- THIS IS MY TATTOO.

36:06.205 --> 36:07.957
MARK WAS MY TATTOO ARTIST.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.417
I'M VERY HAPPY WITH THE PIECE.

36:09.500 --> 36:11.252
- IT'S, LIKE, TOO MUCH
OF THE SAME COLOR DOWN BELOW.

36:11.335 --> 36:14.213
- ONCE IT HEALS UP,
WE ARE DEFINITELY GONNA SEE

36:14.297 --> 36:16.591
MORE OF THE DETAILED WORK
AND THE BLACK SHADING.

36:16.674 --> 36:18.801
- THE WHOLE RIGHT SIDE'S KIND
OF LOST, AND IN THE BOTTOM,

36:18.885 --> 36:19.927
THERE'S NO SHADING WHERE
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE SUNK IN.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.305
- WE CAN'T REALLY TELL
WHAT'S GOING ON.

36:22.388 --> 36:24.974
- WITH THIS TATTOO, YOU'RE LIKE,
"WAIT, WHAT IS IT?"

36:25.057 --> 36:28.019
- I FEEL LIKE MARK'S
IS BETTER THAN ERIK'S.

36:28.102 --> 36:29.770
{\an8}ERIK ADDED WAY TOO MUCH COLOR.

36:29.854 --> 36:31.063
{\an8}I FEEL LIKE MY LINE WORK

36:31.147 --> 36:33.941
{\an8}IS A LOT BETTER WITH MY GEARS
COMPARED TO YOUR LINE WORK.

36:34.025 --> 36:35.151
{\an8}- YOUR GEARS ARE NICER,

36:35.234 --> 36:37.445
{\an8}BUT I THINK THE ACTUAL
BIOMECHANICAL PART OF MINE

36:37.528 --> 36:39.155
{\an8}IS NICER LINE WORK
AND DESIGN FEATURE.

36:39.238 --> 36:41.199
- I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE
NITPICKING WITH MINE

36:41.282 --> 36:43.993
BECAUSE MY ARTIST GAVE ME
THE GEARS THAT I WANTED.

36:44.076 --> 36:45.828
HE GAVE ME THE COLORS I WANTED.

36:45.912 --> 36:47.455
- I'M NOT DISAGREEING WITH YOU
BY ANY MEANS.

36:47.538 --> 36:49.290
I FEEL YOUR ARTIST
DID WHAT YOU WANTED.

36:49.373 --> 36:50.666
IT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED,

36:50.750 --> 36:54.086
SO, I MEAN, MY GUY DOES
BELONG FURTHER DOWN THAN YOURS.

36:54.170 --> 36:56.547
- DO WE ALL AGREE?
all: YES.

36:58.966 --> 37:01.677
- OH, NO.

37:01.761 --> 37:06.182
- ALL RIGHT, THE JUDGES
ARE CALLING DOWN...

37:06.265 --> 37:07.725
JULIA,

37:07.808 --> 37:08.559
DON,

37:08.643 --> 37:10.978
ANGEL,

37:11.062 --> 37:13.314
AND ERIK.

37:13.397 --> 37:14.649
WE'LL SEE YOU AND YOUR RIVALS
DOWNSTAIRS.

37:14.732 --> 37:16.943
- ERIK?

37:17.026 --> 37:18.653
- WHY'D THEY CALL FOUR DOWN?
THIS ISN'T EVEN--

37:18.736 --> 37:19.654
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
I'M GOING DOWN TO FIND OUT.

37:19.737 --> 37:21.656
- TEAR IT UP.

37:25.242 --> 37:30.289
- TODAY, YOU HAD
TO CREATE BIOMECHANICAL TATTOOS

37:30.373 --> 37:33.668
WITH TIGHT, SHARP DETAILS.

37:33.751 --> 37:36.295
ERIK, YOU'RE HERE
BECAUSE THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY

37:36.379 --> 37:38.381
DETERMINED THAT YOU HAD
THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

37:41.425 --> 37:42.593
SURPRISED?

37:42.677 --> 37:44.345
- I'M AT A LOSS FOR WORDS,
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

37:44.428 --> 37:46.055
I THOUGHT I WAS DOING
A GREAT TATTOO,

37:46.138 --> 37:50.017
SOLID BIOMECHANICAL,
SO I'M PISSED OFF.

37:50.101 --> 37:52.103
- WE DON'T ALWAYS AGREE
WITH THE CANVAS JURY.

37:52.186 --> 37:54.355
- IT'S MY FAVORITE TATTOO.
IN MY BOOK, YOU'RE GREAT.

37:54.438 --> 37:56.273
- YOU ARE NOT AT A RISK
OF GOING HOME.

37:56.357 --> 37:59.360
- YOU MADE MY DAY.

37:59.443 --> 38:00.653
- ANGEL.

38:00.736 --> 38:02.113
- I THINK THAT YOU WERE LOST
A LITTLE BIT IN THE DETAILS.

38:02.196 --> 38:04.532
I MEAN,
IF IT'S A DETAIL CHALLENGE,

38:04.615 --> 38:05.199
YOU HAVE TO GET
THE DETAILS RIGHT.

38:05.282 --> 38:07.118
- I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

38:07.201 --> 38:08.536
I'M AN ARTIST,

38:08.619 --> 38:10.162
AND THIS IS
WHAT THE [bleep] I DO.

38:10.246 --> 38:13.165
I CAME HERE WITH A MISSION,
WITH A THIRST, WITH A PROMISE.

38:13.249 --> 38:15.126
I CAN'T LEAVE HERE
EMPTY-HANDED.

38:15.209 --> 38:18.212
- THIS TATTOO,
TO ME, IS VERY MESSY,

38:18.295 --> 38:21.841
AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE DOWN HERE
IN THE BOTTOM.

38:21.924 --> 38:23.259
- DON.

38:23.342 --> 38:26.262
- IF THAT HEART HAD THE DETAILS
IN IT TO LOOK REALISTIC,

38:26.345 --> 38:28.723
THAT WOULD HAVE VASTLY
IMPROVED THIS TATTOO.

38:28.806 --> 38:31.642
- I PRIDE MYSELF IN DRAWING,
AND THEN TO HEAR,

38:31.726 --> 38:34.228
"YOUR DRAWING SUCKS,"
REALLY SUCKS.

38:34.311 --> 38:36.897
- IF WHAT YOU DO AT HOME
IS BETTER THAN THIS,

38:36.981 --> 38:37.940
THEN YOU'RE TOO IN YOUR HEAD.

38:38.024 --> 38:39.817
THAT MIGHT BE YOUR WHOLE PROBLEM
RIGHT NOW.

38:39.900 --> 38:42.445
GOT TO HONE IN
ON YOUR TECHNIQUE.

38:42.528 --> 38:44.155
- JULIA.

38:44.238 --> 38:45.364
- THIS IS NOT THE WORST TATTOO
OF THE DAY.

38:49.869 --> 38:51.704
WHAT YOU DID WITH THIS CANVAS
WAS BY FAR

38:51.787 --> 38:56.042
THE MOST UNPROFESSIONAL DISPLAY
THAT WE'VE SEEN THE WHOLE TIME

38:56.125 --> 38:57.793
I'VE EVER BEEN A PART
OF THIS COMPETITION.

38:57.877 --> 39:02.673
- I HAVE A LOT OF THINGS
GOING ON IN MY PERSONAL LIFE.

39:02.757 --> 39:05.426
I'M HERE FIGHTING
TO CHANGE MY LIFE.

39:05.509 --> 39:07.136
I'M ALL MY KIDS HAVE.

39:07.219 --> 39:08.471
WE HAVE NOTHING,
AND KNOWING THAT, I KNEW

39:08.554 --> 39:12.058
THAT DAY THAT EVERYTHING
OFFICIALLY WAS RIDING ON ME,

39:12.141 --> 39:15.061
THAT I HAD TO MAKE SURE
I GOT THROUGH THIS

39:15.144 --> 39:16.771
AND THAT I DID THE BEST
THAT I COULD.

39:16.854 --> 39:18.272
I THINK I TOOK THAT OUT
ON MY CANVAS.

39:18.355 --> 39:22.526
I AM SO IMMENSELY SORRY
FOR WHAT I DID.

39:24.862 --> 39:27.448
- IT IS HARD ON EVERY CONTESTANT
THAT COMES TO THIS CONTEST--

39:27.531 --> 39:30.701
LEAVING THEIR LIFE,
ADJUSTING TO THESE SURROUNDINGS.

39:30.785 --> 39:34.455
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN
COST YOU THIS COMPETITION.

39:34.538 --> 39:37.458
- ANGEL, DON, AND JULIA,

39:37.541 --> 39:41.462
ANY ONE OF YOU COULD BE
JUSTIFIABLY ELIMINATED.

39:41.545 --> 39:43.506
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

39:46.050 --> 39:50.805
ANGEL, YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE INK MASTER.

39:50.888 --> 39:53.182
- ANGEL, SEEING PEOPLE
REPEATING THE SAME STRUGGLES

39:53.265 --> 39:55.976
OVER AND OVER, IT JUST GETS
TO THE POINT WHERE NO MATTER

39:56.060 --> 39:58.312
HOW MUCH HEART THEY COME
TO THIS COMPETITION WITH,

39:58.395 --> 39:59.438
NOT EVERYBODY CAN WIN.

39:59.522 --> 40:03.234
- PLEASE PACK YOUR MACHINES
AND CLOSE SHOP.

40:09.281 --> 40:12.451
- I'VE BEEN AN ARTIST
ALL MY LIFE.

40:12.535 --> 40:14.495
[metal bangs]
I'M PROUD OF MY WORK.

40:14.578 --> 40:17.665
{\an1}I DON'T AGREE WITH THE FACT THAT
I'M BEING SENT HOME RIGHT NOW.

40:17.748 --> 40:18.624
I'M ENRAGED.

40:23.921 --> 40:26.715
{\an8}announcer: ON THE NEXT EPISODE
OF <i> INK MASTER...</i>

40:26.799 --> 40:28.467
{\an8}- YOU ALL RIGHT, JASON?

40:28.551 --> 40:30.886
{\an8}- I AM SO FREAKING STRESSED
OUT OF MY MIND

40:30.970 --> 40:32.221
{\an8}THAT I CAN'T EVEN
THINK STRAIGHT.

40:32.304 --> 40:34.682
{\an8}YOU'RE GONNA [bleep] ME
OUT OF A $100,000 TATTOO.

40:34.765 --> 40:37.017
{\an8}I'M JUST TIRED
OF YOUR COCKY ATTITUDE.

40:37.101 --> 40:39.145
{\an8}SO, HEY, JOSH, GUESS WHAT?
[bleep] YOU.

40:39.228 --> 40:43.149
{\an8}- IT'S OBVIOUS THAT HIS ANXIETY
IS GETTING TO HIM <i> AGAIN.</i>

40:43.232 --> 40:45.609
{\an8}- YOU LOST THIS BATTLE TO
SOMEBODY THAT DOESN'T DO THIS.

40:45.693 --> 40:47.194
{\an8}- IT'S JUST A SPAGHETTI MESS.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.362
{\an8}- SHE HAS NO NOSE AT ALL.

40:48.445 --> 40:50.364
{\an8}- THAT WAS ACTUALLY
A MISCOMMUNICATION.

40:50.447 --> 40:51.574
{\an8}- THERE IS NO EXCUSES.

40:51.657 --> 40:52.158
{\an8}- IT'S VERY SCRATCHY.

40:52.241 --> 40:54.243
{\an8}- I'M PRETTY LET DOWN.
