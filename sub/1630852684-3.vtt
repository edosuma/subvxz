YAKUZA BOSS: What?

18:28.875 --> 18:30.792
Aah! Son of a bitch!

18:42.292 --> 18:44.458
‐ Aw, man. All you had
to do was lose at poker.

18:44.458 --> 18:46.708
That's so easy.
I do it all the time!

18:46.708 --> 18:50.042
Now they're going to take you out back
and put a bullet behind your ear.

18:50.042 --> 18:53.500
But, hey, now you don't have
to kill anymore, right?

18:55.083 --> 18:57.083
KEPPEI: Ugh! Teppei.

18:57.083 --> 18:58.958
You had to stab him?

18:58.958 --> 19:01.958
You couldn't wait 30 seconds for me
to come back with the blowfish?

19:01.958 --> 19:04.792
‐ Ugh. What is with you
and the blowfish?

19:04.792 --> 19:07.625
‐ What? It's a cool‐ass way
to kill someone!

19:07.625 --> 19:11.292
Paralysis. Respiratory failure.
Diarrhea.

19:11.292 --> 19:12.958
[giggles]
What?

19:13.792 --> 19:16.875
YAKUZA BOSS: Are you two dipshits
running a casino

19:16.875 --> 19:18.375
or a zoo?

19:18.375 --> 19:20.917
‐ Uhhh. A casino?

19:20.917 --> 19:22.875
‐ Relax. It's just a gimmick.

19:22.875 --> 19:24.208
Like a mascot.

19:24.208 --> 19:28.750
‐ Oh yeah? This gimmick just took me
for over six million yen.

19:28.750 --> 19:31.083
And I want it back. Now!

19:31.083 --> 19:33.750
‐ Listen, old man, you can't talk
to us like that anymore.

19:33.750 --> 19:35.292
We're a big deal now.

19:35.292 --> 19:36.958
Running this shit ourselves.

was their mother? [laughing]

19:45.292 --> 19:47.917
Oh my God‐‐ No, no, no, no.
Don't you dare get sad about this.

19:47.917 --> 19:49.500
This is how evil spreads.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.958
Their mom hired me to kill Takahara.

19:51.958 --> 19:54.875
Then had her idiot sons
enlist Kato to kill me.

19:54.875 --> 19:57.083
She deserved to die and so do her kids.

19:57.083 --> 19:58.792
‐ Boys, boys.

19:58.792 --> 20:00.833
If you're not gonna refund my money,

20:00.833 --> 20:03.167
the least you could do
is kill this monkey.

20:03.167 --> 20:05.333
‐ Oh, hell yeah!

20:05.333 --> 20:07.125
[laughing]

20:07.125 --> 20:08.917
That we can do.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.958
‐ Mm‐mm. No way.

20:10.958 --> 20:13.250
You got one.
I get one.

20:14.375 --> 20:18.167
‐ Agh, fine. Just make sure
you prepare it wrong.

20:19.250 --> 20:21.583

what I'm doing.

20:22.833 --> 20:24.125
‐ Okay, keep your cool,
don't panic.

20:24.125 --> 20:26.167
Nobody's gonna panic, okay.
All we gotta do is find something

20:26.167 --> 20:27.458
to undo your cuffs.

20:27.458 --> 20:28.375
KEPPEI: Ta‐da!

20:28.958 --> 20:30.667
Dinner is served.

20:30.667 --> 20:32.250
[laughs]

20:32.250 --> 20:33.542
[hooting]

20:33.542 --> 20:34.417
‐ I‐I got nothing.

20:34.417 --> 20:36.042
You gotta summon
that berserker rage of yours

20:36.042 --> 20:38.042
and bust out of those cuffs
or we're done here.

20:38.042 --> 20:41.167
‐ Okay, monkey. Open wide.

20:43.958 --> 20:45.125
‐ What are you doing?

20:45.125 --> 20:46.500
Are you really going
to die because you're too‐‐

20:46.500 --> 20:49.042
Okay. Okay, look!
Look, look, look! I was wrong.

20:49.542 --> 20:51.292
Killing is not easy.

20:51.292 --> 20:54.625
It's not just point, shoot,
and watch the bad guy go bye‐bye.

20:54.625 --> 20:56.375
It's watch you go bye‐bye.

20:56.375 --> 20:57.792
Because every time
you kill someone,

20:57.792 --> 20:59.708
a little bit of you dies too.

21:00.583 --> 21:03.000
And it sucks.
It sucks balls.

21:03.542 --> 21:05.917
U‐until you're just
too numb to care anymore.

21:05.917 --> 21:09.333
But, but, if you're lucky,
you let it continue to suck.

21:09.333 --> 21:11.333
And you'll never grow numb.

21:11.333 --> 21:12.667
There you go, that's the truth.

21:12.667 --> 21:13.875
You happy?

Oh, that's real mature.

You know, I‐I pour my soul
out to you and you‐‐

21:22.292 --> 21:23.625
Wait, wait, wait! Holy shit!

21:23.625 --> 21:24.917
You‐you're a monkey.

21:24.917 --> 21:28.083
With, uh, weird feet hands
that no one bothered to cuff.

Oh. Nice. Nice.

22:08.125 --> 22:10.083
Get rid of it.
Get rid of it.

22:11.083 --> 22:12.708
There you go.

22:13.583 --> 22:15.750
So I'm thinking there's no way
Takahara's assassination

22:15.750 --> 22:17.875
was orchestrated
by these two nutsacks.

22:17.875 --> 22:18.958
Gotta to be people above them.

22:19.500 --> 22:21.500
And the best way to the heart
of any criminal plot

22:21.500 --> 22:23.000
is to follow the money.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.417
So grab this, and we'll study it
over a celebratory drink.

22:38.375 --> 22:39.292
Wait, hold on.

22:40.292 --> 22:41.458
Was that intentional?

22:41.458 --> 22:43.917
Uh, you know, going overboard
with the booze and the gambling.

22:43.917 --> 22:46.042
Was it, like, all a clever plan
just to get us

22:46.042 --> 22:47.875
in the twins' office
or dumb luck?

22:48.542 --> 22:51.250
It was luck, wasn't it?
No, I mean it had to have been.

22:51.250 --> 22:52.542
Right?

22:52.542 --> 22:54.708
Oh, look at that, there's my job!

500K to "X" K. T.

22:56.958 --> 22:58.625
That's gotta be Ken Takahara, right?
And wait, wait.

22:58.625 --> 23:02.458
Um, these jobs were all paid
by someone called The Accountant.

23:02.458 --> 23:03.958
Oh! Oh!
It's an address.

Sugano 2‐2‐7.

23:08.917 --> 23:10.875
Well, this should be
a cakewalk.

Here's your next lesson:

23:12.917 --> 23:15.208
money men are always
