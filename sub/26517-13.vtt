I own 15 ferrets!

Okay, when was the last time
you snaked this drain?

00:53.140 --> 00:55.142
Never. I only owned this
place for five minutes.

00:55.185 --> 00:57.187
By the way, why
are you doing this?

00:57.231 --> 00:58.710
Tell Rebecca to
get a plumber.

00:58.754 --> 01:00.147
No, dude, I'm just helping out.

01:00.190 --> 01:02.105
I owe Rebecca.
She gave me a place to stay.

01:02.149 --> 01:03.933
You know how much
I pay in rent?

01:04.629 --> 01:05.804
80 bucks a month.

01:05.848 --> 01:06.979
Also, her best friend

01:07.023 --> 01:08.111
just had a heart attack

01:08.155 --> 01:09.765
and she just went
on antidepressants.

01:09.808 --> 01:10.766
I don't know, man,

01:10.809 --> 01:13.421
sounds like you
loveher.

01:13.464 --> 01:15.423
What? No.

01:18.165 --> 01:19.905
No, she-- Dude, shut up.

01:19.949 --> 01:21.603
Okay, nothing's going on
with us whatsoever.

01:21.646 --> 01:24.910
I mean, sure she's
completely adorable 24/7,

01:24.954 --> 01:26.173
and, yes, we did have
a massage moment

01:26.216 --> 01:27.739
the other night that
almost got out of hand.

01:27.783 --> 01:28.740
But she's seeing someone,

01:28.784 --> 01:30.612
and that someone
is Greg Serrano.

01:30.655 --> 01:32.092
Hey, tell yourself
what you need to hear,

01:32.135 --> 01:33.484
but you got hard
feefs for her.

01:33.528 --> 01:35.791
I don't have feefs,
hard or soft.

01:35.834 --> 01:36.966
Rebecca is simply

01:37.009 --> 01:39.229
my friend, who needs a hand

01:39.273 --> 01:42.189
in her time of heart attacks
and antidepressants.

01:42.232 --> 01:44.582
Right.

01:50.675 --> 01:52.373
Thank you so much
for squeezing me in.

01:52.416 --> 01:54.636
I'm only free when Paula's
visiting hours are over.

01:54.679 --> 01:56.333
It's important
to check in

01:56.377 --> 01:58.161
when you start a
new medication.

01:58.205 --> 02:00.163
So, how have
the antidepressants

02:00.207 --> 02:01.251
made you feel so far?

02:01.295 --> 02:02.948
Uh, well, it's only
been a week,

02:02.992 --> 02:04.994
so I know it takes a while
for them to kick in.

02:05.037 --> 02:07.388
But, honestly, very tired.

02:07.431 --> 02:09.129
Hmm.I keep having these episodes

02:09.172 --> 02:10.391
where all I want to do is nap.

02:10.434 --> 02:11.609
Mm-hmm.

02:11.653 --> 02:13.307
Like I'm looking
at this couch right now...

02:13.350 --> 02:14.917
and it's kind of begging
to be napped upon.

02:14.960 --> 02:16.745
It's like, mm,

02:16.788 --> 02:18.355
how you doing, sexy nap couch?

02:18.399 --> 02:20.140
And otherwise?

02:20.183 --> 02:22.707
Mostly fine.

02:22.751 --> 02:24.100
I haven't talked to Greg yet.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.754
And he doesn't know
about all the stuff

02:25.797 --> 02:27.103
that happened the other night.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.104
I mean, he knows we fought

02:28.148 --> 02:29.410
and that I was in a bad place,

02:29.453 --> 02:30.802
but he doesn't know that
I went to Nathaniel's

02:30.846 --> 02:34.197
and tried to...
you know, and that,

02:34.241 --> 02:37.505
then I went home to Josh
and tried to... you know.

02:37.548 --> 02:39.942
So have you and Greg broken up?

02:39.985 --> 02:41.770
Not exactly.
We keep meaning to connect.

02:41.813 --> 02:42.945
We just haven't had time.

02:42.988 --> 02:45.208
You know, I'm busy with Paula

02:45.252 --> 02:46.949
and I need to be there
for her.

02:46.992 --> 02:49.212
I need to try to stay awake,
and I need to sort out

02:49.256 --> 02:51.519
how I feel about being on meds
in the first place.

02:51.562 --> 02:52.781
And what do you mean by that?

02:52.824 --> 02:54.304
Well, look, I've always
been afraid

02:54.348 --> 02:58.090
of going on antidepressants,
but also it kind of feels

02:58.134 --> 02:59.309
like a cop-out to me.

02:59.353 --> 03:00.789
Oh.You know, like

03:00.832 --> 03:03.008
I should've been able
to tough it out on my own.

03:03.052 --> 03:05.228
I just... I feel
a little ashamed.

03:05.272 --> 03:06.664
I understand why
you feel that way.

03:06.708 --> 03:09.232
But I would ask you
to interrogate that feeling.

03:09.276 --> 03:11.582
Mm-hmm. Okay.
What do you mean?

03:11.626 --> 03:16.152
I mean, baby, lots of people
are on those pills.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.022
Like, everyone.

03:17.066 --> 03:18.937
Everyone, really?

03:18.981 --> 03:21.984
Yes! That's what
I've been trying to tell you.

03:22.027 --> 03:23.812
You're not alone in this.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.076

06:46.318 --> 06:47.450
Okay, cool, I'll just pose.

06:54.109 --> 06:57.329
AJ, thank you so much
for covering for me

06:57.373 --> 06:58.809
while I've been
in the hospital with Paula.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.202
And I'm sorry if
I'm yawning a lot.

07:00.245 --> 07:02.030
I'm still getting used
to my new antidepressants.

07:02.073 --> 07:03.118
Oh, yeah, that happened to me

07:03.161 --> 07:04.728
when I started
my antidepressants.

07:04.772 --> 07:06.077
Hang in there.

07:06.121 --> 07:07.296
And, of course,
I'm happy to help.

07:07.339 --> 07:09.298
I know how much
this place means to you.

07:09.341 --> 07:12.301
I love being the chosen
custodian of your dream.

07:12.344 --> 07:14.085
Hmm?

07:14.129 --> 07:16.436
Your dream.
This place?

07:16.479 --> 07:19.134
What, what makes you
think Rebetzel's is my dream?

07:19.177 --> 07:21.353
Uh, because of those shirts.

07:21.397 --> 07:23.747
"Rebetzel's.
Take a bite outta my dream."

07:23.791 --> 07:26.576
Oh, okay. Well, that's-- no,
that's to make people think

07:26.620 --> 07:28.796
that it's my dream, so
they buy more stuff, right?

07:28.839 --> 07:30.928
Like how Kate Hudson
pretends to love leggings.

07:30.972 --> 07:34.454
Huh. Well, if this isn't it,
what is your dream?

07:34.497 --> 07:38.370
My dream? I don't...
I don't know.

07:38.414 --> 07:39.415
Well, if you've got
another dream,

07:39.459 --> 07:41.069
you might want to get on it.

07:41.112 --> 07:43.071
Life is short.
And you're not young.

07:43.114 --> 07:44.464
Ow.

07:45.508 --> 07:46.814
You know what? It's fine.

07:46.857 --> 07:49.599
Honestly, AJ, I'm just
really happy to be alive

07:49.643 --> 07:52.341
and semi-healthy
and finally on meds, so...

07:52.384 --> 07:54.125
So what if I don't have a dream?

07:54.169 --> 07:56.911
Maybe I'll find one.
Maybe I won't.

07:56.954 --> 07:59.130
But I have a lot of life
ahead of me.

08:06.050 --> 08:07.356
Are you supposed to be studying?

08:07.399 --> 08:08.923
Aren't you supposed
to be resting?

08:08.966 --> 08:11.795
The bar exam is tomorrow, guys.

08:11.839 --> 08:12.840
Tomorrow.

08:12.883 --> 08:13.884
VALENCIA:
Yeah, I was thinking,

08:13.928 --> 08:15.146
are you sure
you want to take

08:15.190 --> 08:16.496
the bar exam
right now?

08:16.539 --> 08:18.149
You can do it
next time.

08:18.193 --> 08:19.368
Yeah. You just got
your heart sliced up

08:19.411 --> 08:20.848
like a melon a week ago.

08:20.891 --> 08:23.024
I have to think of it
as a fruit, so I don't throw up.

08:23.067 --> 08:24.155
I mean,

08:24.199 --> 08:25.374
Rebecca, what do you think?

08:25.417 --> 08:26.984
That's, uh, that's melon,

08:27.028 --> 08:29.073
yeah, no, melon, throw up, yep.

08:29.117 --> 08:31.989
Sweetie, you are so tired.

08:32.033 --> 08:35.340
I know. Listen, guys,
they only give the bar exam

08:35.384 --> 08:36.559
twice a year.

08:36.603 --> 08:39.127
And if I have learned anything

08:39.170 --> 08:40.998
from this horrible
heart attack experience,

08:41.042 --> 08:44.828
it's that I could literally die
at any second.

08:44.872 --> 08:47.135
So I have no time to waste.
The doctor's coming in

08:47.178 --> 08:48.702
to tell me when
I can get out,

08:48.745 --> 08:51.008
and I-- you know,
where is my doctor, anyway?

08:51.052 --> 08:54.011
God, it's so weird
how that doctor is the twin

08:54.055 --> 08:55.796
of the doctor
who treated my UTI,

08:55.839 --> 08:57.275
only that Dr. Roth

08:57.319 --> 08:59.974
is an aspiring stand-up
comedian, and this Dr. Roth,

09:00.017 --> 09:01.715
he's not funny at all.

09:03.064 --> 09:05.196
Good morning, Dr. Roth.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.371
It is before noon.

09:06.415 --> 09:08.025
See? No sense of humor.

09:08.069 --> 09:09.113
Oh, if you want comedy,

09:09.157 --> 09:10.375
you should talk
to my idiot brother.

09:10.419 --> 09:11.551
But if you want a stent,

09:11.594 --> 09:13.030
then you should still
not talk to me,

09:13.074 --> 09:15.685
because I gave you
a stent already.

09:16.773 --> 09:18.122
Come on, man.

09:18.166 --> 09:20.168
Doc, I am doing so well.

09:20.211 --> 09:21.952
I passed all my physical tests.

09:21.996 --> 09:23.737
I walked up a flight of stairs.

09:23.780 --> 09:27.218
So I was hoping
that I could go home today.

09:27.262 --> 09:28.437
Yeah, please, she has
something really important

09:28.480 --> 09:31.135
she needs to do.
It has to do with her dream.

09:31.179 --> 09:34.443
'Cause she's one of those people
who has a dream, you know?

09:34.486 --> 09:36.576
Uh, Mrs. Proctor, you look great

09:36.619 --> 09:37.968
and you've had a
very quick recovery.

09:38.012 --> 09:40.536
But we should stick to you
leaving as scheduled.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.190
Okay? I'll be back first
thing tomorrow morning

09:42.233 --> 09:43.931
to sign you out.

09:43.974 --> 09:46.455
Okay. First thing
in the morning. Right.

09:46.498 --> 09:48.022
Just, please, please
don't be late.

09:48.065 --> 09:50.807
I mean, please, please
don't keep me waiting.

09:50.851 --> 09:52.330
DARRYL:
I'm here to see Paula Proctor.

09:52.374 --> 09:55.116
Sorry, buddy. Your friend's
room is maximum capacity.

09:55.159 --> 09:56.204
You're gonna
have to wait.

09:56.247 --> 09:58.467
And have your I.D. ready.

09:58.510 --> 10:01.209
Okay.

10:09.130 --> 10:11.262
You also got
bopped on the nose

10:11.306 --> 10:13.656
by the maximum
visitor rule, I see.

10:13.700 --> 10:16.354
Yeah. Cool lady.

10:16.398 --> 10:18.139
Got to love a nurse
with the aggression

10:18.182 --> 10:20.228
and hostility of
a nightclub bouncer.

10:21.272 --> 10:23.187
Who are you
waiting for?

10:23.231 --> 10:25.668
Oh, my best friend Paula
just had heart surgery.

10:25.712 --> 10:28.410
Oh.She's my best friend,
but I'm not hers.

10:28.453 --> 10:30.499
It's hard to explain.

10:30.542 --> 10:32.066
Oh, no. I get it.

10:32.109 --> 10:34.851
I can't get the nod
from my friend Natalie.

10:34.895 --> 10:37.071
She says I'm "one of
her best friends."

10:37.114 --> 10:38.463
Oh, my gosh, really?

10:38.507 --> 10:40.683
I mean, what is that?Yeah, right?

10:41.902 --> 10:44.252
Who are you waiting for?

10:44.295 --> 10:46.297
My aunt is having
her appendix out.

10:46.341 --> 10:48.473
Oh.She's gonna be
fine, though.

10:48.517 --> 10:50.824
Hmm.

10:54.392 --> 10:56.438
Hope my bean dip's
not bothering you.

10:56.481 --> 10:58.222
Some people don't care
for the earthy smell.

10:58.266 --> 11:01.965
Wait, you-you brought
bean dip to a hospital?

11:02.009 --> 11:03.880
Oh, are you one
of those, um,

11:03.924 --> 11:05.708
"time and a place
for bean dip" people?

11:05.752 --> 11:06.883
I guess I am.

11:08.145 --> 11:11.932
And it's every time
and every place.

11:11.975 --> 11:13.760
Oh, wow!
I mean...

11:13.803 --> 11:15.239
Look at that.I know.

11:15.283 --> 11:16.806
That's crazy.

11:16.850 --> 11:18.286
Hi, I'm April.

11:18.329 --> 11:19.243
Hi. Darryl.
Hi.

11:19.287 --> 11:20.897
Wow, it's so nice
to meet you.

11:20.941 --> 11:22.943
So nice to meet you, too.

11:22.986 --> 11:24.684
Hey, you know, I was thinking
about going down

11:24.727 --> 11:27.295
to the cafeteria
to grab a coffee

11:27.338 --> 11:29.166
if you want to...

11:29.210 --> 11:30.515
Yeah, let's do it.

11:30.559 --> 11:32.126
Really?
Yeah.

11:32.169 --> 11:34.128
Oh-- well, okay.
I mean,

11:34.171 --> 11:35.433
i-if we can talk dip.

11:40.787 --> 11:43.354
Hi. Uh, I'm here to see someone

11:43.398 --> 11:45.966
who is here to see
Paula Proctor.

11:46.009 --> 11:47.576
Why would I care about that?

11:47.619 --> 11:49.143
I mean, you probably wouldn't,

11:49.186 --> 11:51.362
but I really need
to talk to her.

11:51.406 --> 11:52.581
We were seeing each other.

11:52.624 --> 11:53.930
We were actually
in the "babe" stage,

11:53.974 --> 11:55.410
and it was great,
but then we had

11:55.453 --> 11:57.325
this really, really bad day
at Raging Waters, and...

11:57.368 --> 11:58.456
Sir,

11:58.500 --> 12:00.589
don't bring your drama
onto my floor.

12:00.632 --> 12:02.460
Now take a seat behind the rope.

12:02.504 --> 12:05.681
Okay. Yeah, I'll just, uh--
oh, there is an actual rope.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.121
Ah.

12:11.165 --> 12:13.036
Hey, man.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.516
Hey, Greg.

12:14.559 --> 12:16.648
You here to visit Paula?

12:16.692 --> 12:18.738
Yeah. Yeah, flowers.Sure.

12:18.781 --> 12:19.913
You?

12:19.956 --> 12:21.653
Uh, Rebecca and I,

12:21.697 --> 12:24.395
we were actually supposed
to talk at some point.

12:24.439 --> 12:25.919
And she's kind of
stuck here, so I thought

12:25.962 --> 12:29.313
I'd come by and...
and-and, and, yeah.

12:29.357 --> 12:32.926
Ah. Got it.

12:37.974 --> 12:39.367
Oh, good, it's Josh.

12:39.410 --> 12:42.413
Hey, Greg.
Hey, Josh.

12:42.457 --> 12:44.372
Josh, haven't seen you since...Uh, so, Nathaniel, hey.

12:44.415 --> 12:45.939
Oh, you guys already
know each other.

12:45.982 --> 12:47.201
I talked to Greg, yeah, already.Yeah, we already said hi.

12:48.898 --> 12:51.988
You got tall.Did I?

12:52.032 --> 12:52.989
You're here to see Paula?

12:53.033 --> 12:54.469
Yeah, flowers, so...

12:54.512 --> 12:55.905
My sister recently
had a baby,

12:55.949 --> 12:57.777
so I knew where to
get the good ones.

12:57.820 --> 12:59.169
You didn't bring flowers?

12:59.213 --> 13:00.867
No, I was here
to talk to Rebecca.

13:00.910 --> 13:03.086
And flowers are already dying
by the time you buy them,

13:03.130 --> 13:05.480
so you're basically handing
a loved one a bag of remains.

13:06.524 --> 13:09.397
Cool.
Cool.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.399
Well, uh, now that
that's all settled,

13:11.442 --> 13:13.880
I think it's a good moment for
us to all go our separate ways,

13:13.923 --> 13:16.839
moving in separate directions,
maybe quickly.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.623
Ah.
Yeah.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.625
I'm a cough boy!
I'm a little cough boy!

13:20.669 --> 13:23.585
Oh-- hey, hey, buddy. Are you
supposed to be running around?

13:23.628 --> 13:25.892
No, I'm not! I'm a cough boy!

13:25.935 --> 13:27.023
Oh.

13:27.067 --> 13:28.895
Oh.DOCTOR:
Uh...

13:28.938 --> 13:30.940
NATHANIEL:
Whoa.Uh, excuse me,

13:30.984 --> 13:35.031
did this young man cough
within five feet of all of you?

13:35.075 --> 13:38.556
The little cough boy?
Yes, yes, he did, just now.

13:38.600 --> 13:39.906
Oh, that's unfortunate.

13:39.949 --> 13:42.343
You've all been exposed
to a very rare

13:42.386 --> 13:45.955
and super-contagious strain
of squirrel flu.

13:45.999 --> 13:47.043
What?

13:47.087 --> 13:49.045
Who run the world? Squirrels!

13:49.089 --> 13:50.830
You three know each other?

13:50.873 --> 13:52.527
Oh, uh...Uh, uh, a little bit.

13:52.570 --> 13:54.485
Yeah, kind of.Uh, yeah.

13:54.529 --> 13:56.096
Great. Well,
you're about to spend

13:56.139 --> 13:58.098
some quality time together.

13:58.141 --> 13:59.795
In quarantine.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.971
Let's go, gentlemen.

14:02.015 --> 14:02.972
Uh...

14:15.028 --> 14:17.421
Where is the doctor?
I knew this would happen.

14:17.465 --> 14:19.032
He should've been here
30 minutes ago.

14:19.075 --> 14:20.642
All the other students
are sharpening pencils

14:20.685 --> 14:24.080
and knocking back Adderall,
and I'm just sitting here.

14:24.124 --> 14:25.168
I know, I know,

14:25.212 --> 14:26.822
but don't worry.
He'll be here, okay?

14:26.866 --> 14:27.954
We told the nurse to page him.

14:27.997 --> 14:29.216
Okay.

14:29.259 --> 14:30.913
Oh.

14:30.957 --> 14:32.175
Just wanted to let you know
that Dr. Roth's

14:32.219 --> 14:33.524
finishing up his surgery.

14:33.568 --> 14:34.830
Finally.And he'll be back

14:34.874 --> 14:36.310
this afternoon
to sign your release.

14:36.353 --> 14:38.660
Wait, no-- this afternoon?Mm-hmm.

14:38.703 --> 14:40.053
Oh, that is way too late.

14:40.096 --> 14:42.620
No, no, no. We need, we need
another doctor, stat.

14:42.664 --> 14:44.535
Can you sign her out?
I mean, you're wearing scrubs.

14:44.579 --> 14:46.233
You kind of look like a doctor.

14:46.276 --> 14:48.931
You'd think. Nurses do
all the emotional work,

14:48.975 --> 14:52.935
and we are the backbone
of the hospital, but...

14:52.979 --> 14:54.676
you need to be signed out
by your cardiologist.

14:54.719 --> 14:56.417
That's the hospital policy.

15:00.464 --> 15:02.727
What am I gonna do?

15:02.771 --> 15:04.773
This is hell.

15:09.996 --> 15:13.564
Guys, I can't sit in this
awkward silence anymore. Okay?

15:13.608 --> 15:15.958
Is it just because we
dated the same girl?

15:16.002 --> 15:18.134
She chose someone. Greg.

15:18.178 --> 15:20.397
Right? She did
choose you, right?

15:20.441 --> 15:23.096
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I mean, yes.

15:23.139 --> 15:25.925
And, you know, there
might be bumpy stuff

15:25.968 --> 15:28.710
in your relationship,
moments where she got an ATV

15:28.753 --> 15:31.191
and went off-road, but
at the end of the day,

15:31.234 --> 15:34.934
she fired up Waze and she
made her way back to you.

15:34.977 --> 15:36.544
Right?

15:36.587 --> 15:38.198
Yeah.

15:40.026 --> 15:43.638
Well, then there's nothing
to be awkward about.

15:43.681 --> 15:45.031
Right, Josh?

15:45.074 --> 15:47.511
Uh, yup. Nope.

15:47.555 --> 15:50.123
You know, in fact, I think we
could-- and should-- be friends.

15:50.166 --> 15:53.039
After all, Greg, you and I were
gym buddies for two seconds.

15:53.082 --> 15:55.215
And, Josh, you and I
killed game night.

15:55.258 --> 15:58.522
: Yeah. We realized we
have very similar father issues.

15:58.566 --> 16:01.482
Dr. Man Akopian high-fived me
for making that connection.

16:01.525 --> 16:03.571
And you guys were
buds from way back.

16:03.614 --> 16:08.010
Look, I see a lot of potential
for a friend trio here.

16:08.054 --> 16:11.187
Like, a real-life
Three Musketeers reunion?

16:11.231 --> 16:14.060
Who wants to be d'Artagnan? Me.

16:15.975 --> 16:19.282
Sure, the three of us
could be a cool little crew.

16:19.326 --> 16:20.936
And the funny thing is, Greg,
you and I could've been friends

16:20.980 --> 16:22.851
even earlier.Yeah?

16:22.894 --> 16:25.027
Yeah. A few months ago,
when White Josh and I were

16:25.071 --> 16:26.202
having a beer,
and he texted you

16:26.246 --> 16:27.595
to come join us?

16:27.638 --> 16:28.813
JOSH:
Wait, what?

16:28.857 --> 16:29.814
A few months ago?

16:29.858 --> 16:31.120
That doesn't
make any sense.

16:31.164 --> 16:33.209
Greg hasn't been back
in, like, two years.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.434
: I think
he's gonna figure it out.

16:40.477 --> 16:41.609
Hold on, hold on.

16:41.652 --> 16:43.045
Anything could be
happening up there.

16:45.439 --> 16:47.919
Greg, you came back to town
and didn't tell me?

16:47.963 --> 16:50.052
You came back
to West Covina

16:50.096 --> 16:53.360
from Atlanta and saw other
people when you were back?

16:53.403 --> 16:56.580
Like White Josh-- I mean,
did you see Hector, also?

16:56.624 --> 16:58.582
Uh, yeah.

16:58.626 --> 17:00.845
I'm sorry, man.

17:04.849 --> 17:06.025
Hey, Dad?

17:06.068 --> 17:07.939
Hmm.Can we get Arby's
on the way home?

17:07.983 --> 17:10.290
They have the meats.Sure, honey.

17:10.333 --> 17:12.901
We also have to have a talk
about how Paula ended up

17:12.944 --> 17:16.992
needing heart surgery,
at some point.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.125
What are you looking for?

17:19.168 --> 17:20.517
Nothing. Nada.

17:20.561 --> 17:22.345
Oh. Wow.

17:22.389 --> 17:24.304
April, hi.
Hi.

17:24.347 --> 17:27.089
Wow, it's good to see you.
How's your aunt?

17:27.133 --> 17:30.571
Oh, uh, her appendix burst
and she went into septic shock.

17:30.614 --> 17:31.789
Oh, no.

17:31.833 --> 17:33.530
I'm kidding. She's doing great.

17:36.620 --> 17:37.882
I didn't see that coming.

17:37.926 --> 17:39.536
See, that's funny...

17:39.580 --> 17:41.625
Hello, Chloe.

17:41.669 --> 17:43.236
Madison.

17:43.279 --> 17:44.585
Wait, you two know each other?

17:44.628 --> 17:46.021
You could say that.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.457
Can you ever
really know

17:47.501 --> 17:51.287
someone who deliberately
scheduled a sleepover

17:51.331 --> 17:53.942
the same night
as your cake-decorating party?

17:53.985 --> 17:55.944
And can you ever know someone

17:55.987 --> 17:57.598
who knew the sleepover
was scheduled

17:57.641 --> 18:01.558
and refused to move to
an earlier cake-decorating time?

18:01.602 --> 18:05.084
Because cake-decorating
can happen earlier?

18:10.176 --> 18:12.395
PAULA:
I knew this would happen.

18:12.439 --> 18:13.831
Where is the damn doctor?

18:13.875 --> 18:17.008
He is gonna make me miss
my bar exam.

18:17.052 --> 18:18.488
Okay? You know what?

18:18.532 --> 18:20.403
I'm leaving.
I'm just gonna walk out.

18:20.447 --> 18:21.970
Wait, Paula, if you leave
without a signed release,

18:22.013 --> 18:23.798
insurance could refuse to pay
for the entire procedure.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.888
You know a lot about insurance.

18:26.931 --> 18:28.107
Yeah, my husband the surfer
can't tell the difference

18:28.150 --> 18:30.065
between a slippery rock
and a stingray,

18:30.109 --> 18:31.588
and he loves stepping on both.

18:31.632 --> 18:33.938
We're here a lot.
I love my husband.

18:33.982 --> 18:35.462
Oh-- I'm sorry.Whoa.

18:35.505 --> 18:37.246
Sorr-- oh...

18:37.290 --> 18:39.074
So, okay, it's fine.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.598
I'll just start my legal career
in six months

18:41.642 --> 18:46.255
and keep working as a paralegal
and keep reading my book

18:46.299 --> 18:48.083
on Felix Frankfurter.

18:49.432 --> 18:52.740
One of the longest-serving
Supreme Court justices.

18:52.783 --> 18:54.742
No!

18:54.785 --> 18:57.658
Oh, my God, what happened
while I was asleep? No!

18:57.701 --> 18:58.963
Uh-uh. Ladies.

18:59.007 --> 19:02.184
Are we really just gonna
stand here while Paula

19:02.228 --> 19:04.621
is forced to postpone her dream,

19:04.665 --> 19:07.842
so that some doctor
can save a life?

19:07.885 --> 19:09.713
Nuh-uh, not
on my watch.

19:09.757 --> 19:12.151
I mean, I think it's clear
what we need to do here.

19:13.978 --> 19:15.893
We got a big old breakout
on our hands.

19:15.937 --> 19:18.374
What? No. I've been
exfoliating diligently.

19:18.418 --> 19:20.159
She meant break out
of the hospital.

19:20.202 --> 19:22.030
Yeah. Great. Got it.

19:22.073 --> 19:23.640
Okay. You know I'm in, so...Mm-hmm.

19:23.684 --> 19:24.946
let's do it.

19:44.270 --> 19:47.011
Mom, can I have a dollar
for the vending machine?

19:47.055 --> 19:48.056
Oh.

19:48.926 --> 19:50.928
Here you go, sweetie.

19:54.932 --> 19:56.760
I guess our girls
don't get along.

19:56.804 --> 19:59.676
Yeah, I, I got a hint of that.

19:59.720 --> 20:02.940
So I guess they won't be
doing any playdates or...

20:02.984 --> 20:06.466
taking any trips
to the mall.

20:06.509 --> 20:08.032
Or going
to Disney on Ice together

20:08.076 --> 20:09.686
and snuggling under a blanket,

20:09.730 --> 20:13.473
wondering how all those
characters know each other.

20:13.516 --> 20:15.257
Oh, you mean us.

20:15.301 --> 20:17.781
You're talking about us.

20:17.825 --> 20:20.436
Yeah, we can't hang out.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.221
This is a bummer.

20:22.264 --> 20:25.659
I just thought, you know,
for a minute, you and I...

20:25.702 --> 20:29.271
It's so hard to meet someone,
and this feels...

20:29.315 --> 20:30.968
easy.

20:34.320 --> 20:38.193
But the kids are
the most important thing.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.239
Absolutely.

20:41.805 --> 20:43.807
I'll always remember
your bean dip.

20:56.211 --> 20:58.344
Okay, bitches, listen up,
I have a plan.

20:58.387 --> 20:59.780
So here's what we do.

20:59.823 --> 21:02.783
We find some doctors' coats,
pretend to be doctors.

21:02.826 --> 21:04.611
We also find a gurney,
we put Paula on the gurney,

21:04.654 --> 21:05.916
pretend she's a dead body,

21:05.960 --> 21:07.396
we push the gurney
out of the hospital--

21:07.440 --> 21:08.919
no one notices a thing--

21:08.963 --> 21:10.443
then we sneak her back in
after she's taken the bar.

21:10.486 --> 21:12.009
But first, I'm gonna nap.

21:12.053 --> 21:14.273
Just, no-no longer than 45
minutes, 'cause I'm so tired.

21:14.316 --> 21:16.536
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.No, no, no.

21:16.579 --> 21:19.365
Okay... no, no nap! No nap!
No nap, you're right.

21:19.408 --> 21:23.107
You're right. No nap.
I love my friend.

21:23.151 --> 21:25.545
Look, Greg, I know you and I
went through some drama

21:25.588 --> 21:27.024
because Rebecca
was obsessed with me and then

21:27.068 --> 21:28.896
she was with you and then
you got drunk at a wedding

21:28.939 --> 21:30.724
and then I had sex with her
in a vintage car.

21:30.767 --> 21:32.247
But we had
gotten past

21:32.291 --> 21:35.903
all that, and then
you ghosted me for two years?

21:35.946 --> 21:38.688
Look, you were with Rebecca,
and engaged to her,

21:38.732 --> 21:41.082
and a little distance
seemed healthy.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.344
I didn't call her

21:42.388 --> 21:43.737
when I came back
to town, either.

21:43.780 --> 21:45.739
No, I-I hear what
you're doing, okay?

21:45.782 --> 21:47.567
Sounding all evolved and stuff.

21:47.610 --> 21:50.439
Well, guess what. I'm in therapy
now, so I speak that lingo,

21:50.483 --> 21:51.962
and I can tell you
that your actions

21:52.006 --> 21:54.356
have made me feel judged,
which is quite unfair,

21:54.400 --> 21:56.967
because I have never
judged you, ever.

21:57.011 --> 21:59.666
Josh...Okay, guys, let's
stay positive here.

21:59.709 --> 22:00.841
Like, when you once
got so drunk,

22:00.884 --> 22:02.495
you had sex with a bush
in my front yard.

22:02.538 --> 22:04.366
Did I say anything? No.

22:04.410 --> 22:06.977
I'm sorry, sex with a...A bush. A bush.

22:07.021 --> 22:08.936
He had sex with a bush.

22:08.979 --> 22:10.981
In my defense,
it looked like a lady.

22:11.852 --> 22:13.027
Bush looked like a lady.

22:14.376 --> 22:16.160
Don't make jokes.
It's not funny.

22:16.204 --> 22:18.598
I had to tell my mom an ostrich
escaped from the zoo

22:18.641 --> 22:19.947
and buried its head
in her garden.

22:19.990 --> 22:21.296
Okay, quick thinking, Josh,

22:21.340 --> 22:23.167
and congrats on
your agility, Greg,

22:23.211 --> 22:25.518
but let's-let's talk
about something else now,

22:25.561 --> 22:26.519
anything else.

22:38.400 --> 22:42.361
Oh, wow, auditions
for an Elliot Ellison revue.

22:42.404 --> 22:45.494
Huh. I wonder if they're doing
the original arrangements

22:45.538 --> 22:47.496
or the crappy ones
from the movies.

22:47.540 --> 22:50.630
Eh, who am I kidding?
I'm front row either way.

22:50.673 --> 22:53.197
Take this.

22:53.241 --> 22:54.677
Gurney!

22:54.721 --> 22:57.593
No, no, I don't want
to hear it again.

22:57.637 --> 22:59.639
You called me out here
to tell me a joke?

22:59.682 --> 23:02.642
Oh, no, the Doctors Roth.I don't have time for this.

23:02.685 --> 23:04.992
It's important, though.
I just came up with a whole new

23:05.035 --> 23:07.690
comedy area,
airplane food.

23:07.734 --> 23:09.388
It's gross, it's tiny.

23:09.431 --> 23:12.216
Sometimes it's free but
sometimes it's expensive?

23:12.260 --> 23:13.740
What?

23:13.783 --> 23:15.916
I'm busy. You're gonna have
to try it on someone else.

23:15.959 --> 23:17.396
No, no, please,
please, please, please.

23:17.439 --> 23:19.136
You're the only person I trust
with this kind of comedy.

23:19.180 --> 23:20.573
You have such a good
sense of humor.

23:20.616 --> 23:22.618
Okay.
Okay, great!

23:22.662 --> 23:24.098
Okay, have you noticed
that they're selling

23:24.141 --> 23:25.708
all these chicken wraps,
but it's, like, what,

23:25.752 --> 23:27.928
have you never heard
of a sandwich?

23:27.971 --> 23:30.496
I mean, did your bread
get run over by a Kia?

23:30.539 --> 23:34.108
Ks are a funny sound. Most
people love Ks. Is that-- Okay.

23:34.151 --> 23:35.631
Ha-Have you ever noticed that,
like, they're putting

23:35.675 --> 23:37.633
the-these wraps
on these-these flatbreads?

23:37.677 --> 23:39.635
But it's, like,
pa-no, panino...

23:39.679 --> 23:43.117
panini-no. Uh-uh,
pa-no, thank you.

23:43.160 --> 23:46.076
Panini, no, thank you.
Panina, not now-now.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.556
Well, you're giving me
dead eyes, and I hate

23:47.600 --> 23:49.079
when you give me dead eyes
'cause I love you,

23:49.123 --> 23:51.081
but I just don't feel
like we're connecting.

23:51.125 --> 23:52.822
I have to go.

23:52.866 --> 23:57.044
What's this gurney
doing unattended?

23:57.087 --> 23:58.915
This is not supposed to be here.

23:58.959 --> 24:01.048
All right, well,
off to the morgue.

24:10.666 --> 24:12.494
Uh, Dad.

24:12.538 --> 24:13.887
Hmm?
Paula's getting
out today.

24:13.930 --> 24:16.803
We can just see her at home.
Why are we still here?

24:16.846 --> 24:21.634
No reason.
You want to
see April.

24:21.677 --> 24:24.245
No, no, no, I don't.Yes, you do.
You do, you do.

24:24.288 --> 24:25.420
Look, I know how you
feel about her daughter,

24:25.464 --> 24:27.030
and so it can't be.
Dad.

24:27.074 --> 24:29.032
That's okay.
Is it?

24:29.076 --> 24:31.513
Yes. I'm your
and Hebby's father first.

24:31.557 --> 24:35.517
But if you want to spend time
with her, you should.

24:35.561 --> 24:36.823
Chloe and I will
get over ourselves.

24:36.866 --> 24:38.346
No, really,
it's okay.

24:38.389 --> 24:41.523
The fact is, dating is hard
and you can get hurt.

24:41.567 --> 24:45.092
I'm fine. April is just a nice
lady I met in a waiting room,

24:45.135 --> 24:46.528
and that is all.

24:46.572 --> 24:48.661
But maybe she's
your person,

24:48.704 --> 24:51.577
and if you don't spend time
with her, you'll never know.

24:51.620 --> 24:54.928
Madison, it's fine,
I promise.

25:03.545 --> 25:05.721
She's been gone too long.

25:05.765 --> 25:07.723
I called her, but it went
straight to voice mail.

25:07.767 --> 25:09.551
Oh, I'll do find your iPhone.

25:09.595 --> 25:10.770
You know her log-in?

25:10.813 --> 25:13.250
I mean, you know the
answer to that question.

25:13.294 --> 25:15.339
Okay, I got a dot.

25:15.383 --> 25:17.690
Huh. She's in the basement
of the hospital.

25:17.733 --> 25:20.867
The basement? No.

25:28.222 --> 25:30.050
MORTICIAN:
This poor guy died
two days short

25:30.093 --> 25:31.660
of his 30th birthday.MORTICIAN 2: So young.

25:31.704 --> 25:33.662
Probably thought he had
all the time in the world.

25:33.706 --> 25:35.838
MORTICIAN 1: Yeah, you're right,
makes you want to live your life

25:35.882 --> 25:37.274
to the fullest, no regrets.

25:37.318 --> 25:39.233
MORTICIAN 2:
I hear you. Smoke break?

25:39.276 --> 25:42.628
MORTICIAN 1: Yup, if we leave
now, we can smoke a couple.

25:49.112 --> 25:50.070
What?

25:54.770 --> 25:56.946
Hello?
No, no, no, no, no!

25:56.990 --> 25:58.600
No! Ugh!

25:58.644 --> 26:00.950
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

26:00.994 --> 26:02.430
Hey!

26:02.473 --> 26:06.652
I'm in here. Someone let me out.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

You know what? I don't care
we're not friends anymore.

28:51.077 --> 28:52.600
Actually, that's great news

28:52.643 --> 28:54.820
because now I can tell you
how I really feel.

28:55.646 --> 28:56.865
You don't deserve Rebecca.

28:56.909 --> 28:57.823
I'm sorry, what?

28:57.866 --> 28:59.259
JOSH:
You heard me.

28:59.302 --> 29:00.782
Look, I've had my issues
with Rebecca over the years,

29:00.826 --> 29:03.089
but I was always nice to her.
You were a dick to her.

29:03.132 --> 29:05.874
You're not good enough for her,
and you never will be.

29:05.918 --> 29:08.747
Oh, you were always
nice to her? Oh, okay.

29:08.790 --> 29:11.532
Well, so sweet of you to leave
her at the altar. Really nice

29:11.575 --> 29:13.882
of you to join the priesthood
and not even let her know.

29:13.926 --> 29:15.754
Honestly, I am shocked

29:15.797 --> 29:17.756
she even talks to you after
the way you treated her.

29:18.844 --> 29:20.759
Ah!

29:20.802 --> 29:24.371
Oh, my God.
Ow.

29:24.414 --> 29:25.546
Look what you made me do!

29:25.589 --> 29:26.895
Okay...I promised my sensei

29:26.939 --> 29:28.505
I would never use
my karate on someone

29:28.549 --> 29:30.159
who is not my physical equal.

29:30.203 --> 29:33.467
Are you calling me weak?
I'm not weak!

29:33.510 --> 29:35.425
I've been hitting the gym.
Ask Nathaniel.

29:35.469 --> 29:36.905
I've been going

Nope.

: The squirrel
flu began in the jungle,

spread to domesticated cows,
then back to squirrels again.

32:33.777 --> 32:34.909

33:02.502 --> 33:03.851
No... Get off me.Hey, hey, hey.

33:03.894 --> 33:05.461
Easy, easy. Come on.

33:12.555 --> 33:14.166
It's definitely
in here, Mom.

33:14.209 --> 33:17.038

It's prime Gram hour,

33:17.082 --> 33:19.040

Hi.Hi.

33:22.087 --> 33:23.740

Have you guys seen it?

33:23.784 --> 33:25.916
Oh, no, but we-we'll take
a look for it.

33:29.703 --> 33:31.052
You know what we should do
is just call it.

33:31.096 --> 33:33.968

Good job.
You, too.

34:09.134 --> 34:10.874
Hey, should we Gram
this moment?

34:12.963 --> 34:15.053
I'll Gram, you're tagged.
Let's just start there.

34:15.096 --> 34:17.055
Fizzy.

34:18.621 --> 34:20.928
You know,
after Rebecca dumped me

34:20.971 --> 34:24.062
and said a bunch of devastating
things about my character,

34:24.105 --> 34:26.064
I went out and I bought
a bunch of books

34:26.107 --> 34:27.935
about ethics
and morals

34:27.978 --> 34:31.721
and-and people and-and
kindness and all that stuff.

34:31.765 --> 34:34.115
And one of the
things I learned is,

34:34.159 --> 34:39.686
the opposite of love isn't
hate, it's indifference.

34:39.729 --> 34:40.730
You guys fought

34:40.774 --> 34:43.255
because you care
about each other.

34:43.298 --> 34:45.474
Yeah. He's right.

34:45.518 --> 34:49.609
Look, we grew apart, but I still
care about you, dude,

34:49.652 --> 34:51.176
and I always will.

34:51.219 --> 34:53.003
Yeah, me, too.

34:53.047 --> 34:56.050
So we're not best friends
anymore, but...

34:56.094 --> 34:57.965
we're still bros, right?

34:58.008 --> 35:00.707
Yeah, man. Bros.

35:01.664 --> 35:04.406
All for one...

35:04.450 --> 35:05.799
Oh, man...

35:05.842 --> 35:07.235
Guys, do it. Do it.

35:07.279 --> 35:09.324
Get your hands in there.

35:09.368 --> 35:12.284
And one for all--
I'm d'Artagnan.

35:12.327 --> 35:14.460
I called it.

35:17.027 --> 35:21.771
Okay. There and back
without anyone noticing.

35:21.815 --> 35:23.295
Our breakout was
a roaring success,

35:23.338 --> 35:25.949
not one complication or problem,
just like Ocean's 8.

35:28.038 --> 35:33.174
I think that this was
the best day of my life.

35:33.218 --> 35:38.179
A heist and a long legal exam
that I was totally prepared for.

35:38.223 --> 35:40.181
I mean, just heaven.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.010
God, you know,
watching you there,

35:43.053 --> 35:45.665
in the bar exam room, just
taking that test, it...

35:45.708 --> 35:46.927
it was amazing.

35:46.970 --> 35:49.147
You were so happy.
Aw.

35:49.190 --> 35:50.539
You watched for a few minutes?

35:50.583 --> 35:52.019
Actually, I watched
for the whole six hours.

35:52.062 --> 35:53.499
What?

35:53.542 --> 35:54.717
I did take some standing naps,

35:54.761 --> 35:57.416
but it was just so inspiring,
I had to.

35:57.459 --> 36:00.984
Okay, there is something
behind that smile. Come on.

36:01.028 --> 36:04.031
I...
You okay?

36:04.074 --> 36:06.076
I... Yeah, you know what?

36:06.120 --> 36:09.819
To be honest, I
envy you. Really.

36:09.863 --> 36:11.821
The way that you've gone after
your dream, just unabashed,

36:11.865 --> 36:14.215
I-I don't think I would have
the courage to do that.

36:14.259 --> 36:16.870
You have Rebetzel's. Wait,
you're not happy at Rebetzel's?

36:16.913 --> 36:19.046
I am. I just...

36:19.089 --> 36:21.091
I haven't found my thing.

36:22.092 --> 36:23.137
And Rebetzel's isn't my thing,

36:23.181 --> 36:25.270
it's just the thing
that I did next.

36:25.313 --> 36:27.228
But there's a thing.
I mean, there's-there's

36:27.272 --> 36:28.360
something you've dreamt about.

36:28.403 --> 36:30.231
No, not really.

36:31.537 --> 36:32.886
Well, yes.

36:32.929 --> 36:36.063
Mm... There is.

36:36.106 --> 36:37.064
But...

36:37.107 --> 36:39.066
I don't know. It's dumb.

36:39.109 --> 36:42.983
It's dumb, and I've just never
had the courage to pursue it.

36:43.026 --> 36:44.245
Well, honey,

36:44.289 --> 36:46.073
if we know one thing,

36:46.116 --> 36:48.336
it is that we are all gonna
end up in the hospital basement,

36:48.380 --> 36:50.077
for reals, at some point.

36:50.120 --> 36:51.339
Okay? So,

36:51.383 --> 36:53.863
before that happens,

36:53.907 --> 36:57.084
maybe you should give
this dumb thing a try.

37:02.698 --> 37:05.745
Okay, so I have
some exciting news.

37:06.528 --> 37:07.834
I just signed up to audition

37:07.877 --> 37:11.054
for a local community
theater production.

37:11.098 --> 37:13.405
Do you think I'm insane
and delusional and a weirdo?

37:13.448 --> 37:14.754
Uh, no way.
: I mean,

37:14.797 --> 37:16.190
it clearly makes you happy.

37:16.234 --> 37:18.061
I mean, look at you.

37:18.105 --> 37:20.281
I know. I'm so excited.

37:20.325 --> 37:23.066
Oh, God, this just--
it feels really right.

37:23.110 --> 37:25.199
Theater always keeps
coming up in my life.

37:25.243 --> 37:27.680
Just the other day, I fooled
two medical professionals

37:27.723 --> 37:29.377
into thinking that I was dead.

37:29.421 --> 37:31.074
And I really took on the role,
you know?

37:31.118 --> 37:32.685
I felt so alive, being dead.

37:32.728 --> 37:35.122
Well, I-I know
you're gonna be amazing.

37:35.165 --> 37:37.385
Thank you.

37:37.429 --> 37:39.822
Thank you. You're so
supportive and sweet.

37:39.866 --> 37:41.781
Oh...
I'm really glad
you're my roommate.

37:41.824 --> 37:44.740
I mean, God, who would've
thought we could be
just friends?

37:44.784 --> 37:48.309
Yeah. Yeah, we are just totally,
completely only friends.

37:48.353 --> 37:50.659
Yes. Exactly.

37:50.703 --> 37:53.227
Thank you.

38:00.495 --> 38:02.454
Oh, that's Greg.

38:02.497 --> 38:04.456
I'll, uh--
just give me a second.

38:04.499 --> 38:06.284
Greg. Right.

38:14.988 --> 38:16.119
Hi.

38:16.163 --> 38:17.207
Hey.

38:17.251 --> 38:18.513
What happened?

38:18.557 --> 38:20.950
Oh, yeah. Well,
you should see the other guy.

38:20.994 --> 38:22.256
Oh.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.431
How's Paula?

38:23.475 --> 38:24.824
She's so much better.
Thank you.

38:24.867 --> 38:26.042
Good.Um...

38:26.086 --> 38:29.829
So, you were right
the other day about...

38:29.872 --> 38:31.483
me being behind on therapy.

38:31.526 --> 38:32.832
I was... I was really behind.

38:32.875 --> 38:35.748
And, uh, I started doing
the work again,

38:35.791 --> 38:38.359
and I'm finally on meds.

38:38.403 --> 38:39.839
Yeah. And I'm still

38:39.882 --> 38:41.884
getting used to them,
so if I fall asleep

38:41.928 --> 38:43.016
during this conversation,
that's why.

38:43.059 --> 38:44.322
Well, that's great.

38:44.365 --> 38:45.627
About the meds.

38:45.671 --> 38:47.934
Yeah. Um...

38:47.977 --> 38:50.371
and so, after we fought,
I felt really abandoned,

38:50.415 --> 38:52.765
which is a major trigger for me.

38:52.808 --> 38:54.375
And I got...

38:54.419 --> 38:55.768
really drunk...

38:55.811 --> 38:58.248
and then I kind of went
to Nathaniel's apartment,

38:58.292 --> 39:01.251
and then kind of had a
weird massage moment with Josh.

39:01.295 --> 39:03.297
Not kind of.
I did. Um, I did.

39:03.341 --> 39:06.692
And nothing happened, but yeah.

39:08.911 --> 39:11.740
Rebecca.

39:11.784 --> 39:13.525
Come on.

39:13.568 --> 39:17.267
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

39:17.311 --> 39:19.400
And look, I just...

39:19.444 --> 39:21.750
we started dating,
and I got really behind

39:21.794 --> 39:23.926
on my mental health stuff,
and that is on me,

39:23.970 --> 39:25.667
that is not on you.

39:25.711 --> 39:28.583
And I think I just need
to take a beat now

39:28.627 --> 39:30.890
before I get
into anything serious.

39:30.933 --> 39:33.762
Yeah, I would say so.

39:33.806 --> 39:35.111
Wow.

39:36.809 --> 39:40.465
But I still really care
about you, like...

39:40.508 --> 39:42.510
so much.

39:42.554 --> 39:44.338
Me, too.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.862
I don't know, friends?

39:47.907 --> 39:49.691
Okay, yeah.

39:49.735 --> 39:51.954
Probably for the best.

39:51.998 --> 39:54.000
Yep.

40:26.989 --> 40:28.556
Hey, man.

40:28.600 --> 40:30.993
Hey.You okay?

40:31.037 --> 40:32.473
Didn't see you
at the noon class.

40:32.517 --> 40:34.649
Catalina and I missed you.
She brought your gloves.

40:34.693 --> 40:37.173
Yeah, I, uh...

40:37.217 --> 40:39.785
Rebecca and I, we're
just friends again.

40:39.828 --> 40:41.569
It didn't work out.

40:41.613 --> 40:43.441
Oh, man.

40:43.484 --> 40:44.964
I'm sorry.

40:45.007 --> 40:46.574
