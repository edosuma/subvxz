&lrm;-Oh!

02:09.160 --> 02:13.480
&lrm;Hoo-hoo! Well, Mrs Michel,
&lrm;has Whiskers got vertigo again?

02:13.600 --> 02:17.280
&lrm;Have no fear. This is a mission for...

&lrm;Uh, what exactly
&lrm;were you planning with that?

02:30.120 --> 02:34.040
&lrm;Er, uh... It takes more than this
&lrm;to dissuade... The Owl!

02:35.240 --> 02:37.520
&lrm;Here, kitty, kitty! Come to Owl!

02:38.640 --> 02:42.320
&lrm;-OK, I'll call the fire department.
&lrm;-No need for that, Mrs Michel.

02:42.800 --> 02:45.560
&lrm;Uh-oh, Whiskers!
&lrm;Stay calm. Come on now!

02:50.560 --> 02:55.280
&lrm;Mr Dam... uh, Owl! This is the fifth time
&lrm;this week we've come to your rescue!

02:55.400 --> 02:58.840
&lrm;You're really gonna get hurt
&lrm;one of these days! At least wear a helmet.

02:58.960 --> 03:00.680
&lrm;But you don't wear helmets!

03:00.800 --> 03:06.200
&lrm;Mr Owl, we've told you already, it's not
&lrm;the same for us. We're&lrm;<i> real</i>&lrm; superheroes.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.880
&lrm;With real superpowers and magic suits.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.080
&lrm;I know, but since I was a little boy,

03:11.200 --> 03:14.600
&lrm;I only ever dreamed
&lrm;of becoming a real superhero.

03:14.720 --> 03:15.560
&lrm;Come on, boys!

03:19.560 --> 03:21.600
&lrm;<i>The exploits of Ladybug and Cat Noir</i>

03:21.720 --> 03:24.280
&lrm;<i>inspired some people</i>
&lrm;<i>to act as superheroes.</i>

03:24.400 --> 03:27.240
&lrm;<i>But is it a good thing?</i>
&lrm;<i>Over to our reporter Clara Contard.</i>

03:27.360 --> 03:30.320
&lrm;<i>Today, Ladybug and Cat Noir</i>
&lrm;<i>have once again come to the aid</i>

03:30.440 --> 03:32.680
&lrm;<i>of the self-proclaimed superhero,</i>
&lrm;<i>The Owl.</i>

03:32.800 --> 03:36.040
&lrm;<i>Thanks to sound advice from my good</i>
&lrm;<i>friends, Ladybug and Cat Noir,</i>

03:36.160 --> 03:38.360
&lrm;<i>I am certain I will do better next time.</i>

03:38.480 --> 03:41.000
&lrm;<i>I will be reviewing my weaponry</i>
&lrm;<i>and training,</i>

03:41.120 --> 03:44.440
&lrm;<i>because, wherever there's injustice,</i>
&lrm;<i>there's... The Owl!</i>

03:47.480 --> 03:48.680
&lrm;<i>Hoo-hoo!</i>

03:48.800 --> 03:50.800
&lrm;[coughs and splutters]

&lrm;<i>Hoo-hoo!</i>

03:52.040 --> 03:53.600
&lrm;-[brakes and honking]
&lrm;-Sorry!

03:53.720 --> 03:57.320
&lrm;<i>-Any comments, Ladybug and Cat Noir?</i>
&lrm;<i>-Er, you know, he's a great guy.</i>

03:57.440 --> 04:01.360
&lrm;<i>But, to all the children of Paris,</i>
&lrm;<i>you mustn't copy him, OK?</i>

04:01.480 --> 04:03.000
&lrm;<i>It's very dangerous!</i>

04:03.120 --> 04:06.280
&lrm;<i>Ladybug's right.</i>
&lrm;<i>So, don't try this at home. OK, kids?</i>

04:06.400 --> 04:09.480
&lrm;<i>Meanwhile, the question that remains</i>
&lrm;<i>on every lip is,</i>

04:09.600 --> 04:14.040
&lrm;<i>"Who lies behind the mask of The Owl,</i>
&lrm;<i>the clumsiest superhero in all of Paris?"</i>

04:15.600 --> 04:19.800
&lrm;The principal, Mr Damocles, has a good
&lrm;heart, but this is bound to end badly.

04:19.920 --> 04:23.000
&lrm;And we can't spend all our time
&lrm;watching out for him, either.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.000
&lrm;It's turning into a full-time job!

04:27.680 --> 04:30.040
&lrm;Perhaps we should convince him
&lrm;to stop trying

04:30.160 --> 04:34.360
&lrm;-by scaring him, for example?
&lrm;-And shatter the poor man's dream? No way!

04:34.480 --> 04:37.440
&lrm;Instead, maybe we should help him
&lrm;make his dream come true.

04:37.560 --> 04:41.320
&lrm;He said all he wanted was to be a hero,
&lrm;even if it was just for one day.

04:41.440 --> 04:44.440
&lrm;Of course!
&lrm;If we make him a hero for a day,

04:44.560 --> 04:48.560
&lrm;he'll be happy and quit playing this
&lrm;dangerous game. Spot on, as usual, Milady!

04:48.680 --> 04:52.800
&lrm;-We just need to figure out how.
&lrm;-I just may have an idea.

05:23.680 --> 05:25.840
&lrm;Sorry, but my parents

&lrm;-But for sure I'll be free tomorrow.
&lrm;-Come on, chop-chop. Hurry along now!

05:29.760 --> 05:32.960
&lrm;Sorry, Nino, same as usual.

&lrm;-Ready for the test, Albert?
&lrm;<i>-Please repeat.</i>

&lrm;[evil laugh]
&lrm;Never!

06:23.680 --> 06:27.880
&lrm;And I'll never tell you that I'm holding
&lrm;them at Place des Vosges square, either!

06:28.000 --> 06:31.040
&lrm;Ha, ha!
&lrm;You gave yourself away, Cardboard Girl!

06:31.160 --> 06:34.440
&lrm;Now you shall face
&lrm;the feathered fury of... The Owl!

06:34.720 --> 06:37.120
&lrm;Hoo-hoo! Oh! Ouch!

06:39.040 --> 06:40.720
&lrm;-So, how was I?
&lrm;-Nailed it.

06:40.840 --> 06:45.960
&lrm;-Now you just need to put this on!
&lrm;-Uh... you sure about this... outfit?

06:46.080 --> 06:47.440

&lrm;I am not Mr Damocles! I am The Owl!

07:25.920 --> 07:28.120
&lrm;You've revealed my secret identity!

07:29.840 --> 07:33.080
&lrm;We're sorry, Mr... Owl! We didn't mean to!

07:33.200 --> 07:34.920
&lrm;Don't take it the wrong way.

07:38.200 --> 07:39.880

&lrm;Sorry it was a bust.
&lrm;You were trying to do the right thing.

&lrm;Yeah. Now we just have to hope
&lrm;no one hears about it.

&lrm;Dark Owl, I am Hawk Moth.

08:49.840 --> 08:54.360
&lrm;From now on, you will have true
&lrm;superpowers and formidable weapons.

08:54.480 --> 08:57.560
&lrm;Nothing and no one will be able
&lrm;to overpower you!

08:57.680 --> 09:00.520
&lrm;And if you want to be
&lrm;the sole superhero of Paris,

09:00.640 --> 09:02.880
&lrm;there's just one thing you need to do.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.640
&lrm;Defeat Ladybug and Cat Noir
&lrm;and bring me their Miraculous!

09:07.480 --> 09:11.280

&lrm;<i>With just one movement, I can release</i>
&lrm;<i>the rope holding up this city bus,</i>

09:29.880 --> 09:34.000
&lrm;<i>and all the animals inside will crash down</i>
&lrm;<i>upon this poor, helpless little kitten!</i>

09:34.120 --> 09:36.440
&lrm;- [evil laughter]
&lrm;-Tikki, I think we've got...

&lrm;...a serious problem.

09:38.320 --> 09:41.800
&lrm;<i>And if anyone should be tempted to come</i>
&lrm;<i>and save these animals, beware,</i>

09:41.920 --> 09:45.920
&lrm;<i>it is all rigged! Liquid nitrogen will</i>
&lrm;<i>douse the feet of the Eiffel Tower,</i>

09:46.040 --> 09:50.440
&lrm;<i>freezing them to minus 700 degrees</i>
&lrm;<i>and making them more fragile than glass.</i>

09:50.560 --> 09:55.960
&lrm;<i>They will collapse, and the bus will</i>
&lrm;<i>flatten our cute kitten friend! Mwahahaha!</i>

09:56.080 --> 09:59.680
&lrm;<i>Ladybug, Cat Noir, the only way</i>
&lrm;<i>you can save these sweet animals</i>

09:59.800 --> 10:02.160
&lrm;<i>is to come</i>
&lrm;<i>and hand your Miraculous over to me!</i>

10:02.280 --> 10:04.560
&lrm;<i>And you only have ten minutes!</i>

10:04.680 --> 10:06.480

10:13.880 --> 10:14.800
&lrm;Ha!

&lrm;-Albert, the signal!
&lrm;<i>-At your service, sir.</i>

10:36.640 --> 10:38.040
&lrm;It's perfect.

10:42.240 --> 10:44.960
&lrm;Wow! That principal
&lrm;sure is holding a grudge!

10:45.080 --> 10:47.160
&lrm;We've definitely ruffled his feathers!

10:47.280 --> 10:49.600
&lrm;We must stop the countdown.

10:49.720 --> 10:52.240
&lrm;If you want,
&lrm;I can distract him with chitchat!

10:52.360 --> 10:54.840
&lrm;You certainly are the cat for the job!

10:54.960 --> 10:57.120
&lrm;Let's stay in touch!

11:06.920 --> 11:09.680
&lrm;Hoo-hoo! Mr Damocles!

11:10.120 --> 11:14.200
&lrm;I am not Mr Damocles!
&lrm;I am... The Dark Owl!

11:14.320 --> 11:17.600
&lrm;Let's talk about this. Why don't we just
&lrm;team up, the three of us?

11:17.720 --> 11:20.680
&lrm;After all,
&lrm;you do have real powers now!

&lrm;Where is Ladybug?

&lrm;The akuma must be in one of his weapons.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.880
&lrm;Yeah, but which one?
&lrm;Ladybug will be here any minute.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.760

&lrm;in the box in the middle of the stadium!

&lrm;-Heroes don't hurt innocent beings!

12:57.080 --> 12:58.920
&lrm;A fountain pen?

12:59.040 --> 13:01.600
&lrm;What are you gonna do,
&lrm;ask him to sign an autograph?

13:02.840 --> 13:05.040
&lrm;I'm deactivating the detonator, Milady!

13:11.400 --> 13:13.800
&lrm;-What?
&lrm;-Hoomerang!

13:17.040 --> 13:18.520
&lrm;Albert! Activate the hatch!

13:19.280 --> 13:20.240
&lrm;[screaming]

13:22.160 --> 13:27.240
&lrm;I am the Guardian of Paris!
&lrm;I am... The Dark Owl!

13:27.360 --> 13:28.920
&lrm;Mwahahaha!

13:29.040 --> 13:31.760
&lrm;-The countdown is still running!
&lrm;-That's impossible!

13:33.480 --> 13:36.000
&lrm;-Oh, come on! Please!
&lrm;-It looks like...

13:36.120 --> 13:37.840
&lrm;Mmm! Tastes like whipped cream!

13:39.720 --> 13:43.240
&lrm;-Oh, no!
&lrm;<i>-Time's up! Albert, drop the bus!</i>

13:46.600 --> 13:51.720
&lrm;<i>Mwahahaha! You naives!</i>
&lrm;<i>It was a hologram all along!</i>

13:51.840 --> 13:56.040
&lrm;So, how does it feel to lose,
&lrm;for once, and be humiliated?

13:56.160 --> 13:58.280
&lrm;Did you really think
&lrm;I would hurt a kitten?

13:58.400 --> 14:01.120
&lrm;<i>This next trap, though, is very real.</i>

14:01.240 --> 14:03.920
&lrm;<i>The room you're in is filling up</i>
&lrm;<i>with whipped cream.</i>

14:04.040 --> 14:07.720
&lrm;<i>Whipped cream's too thick to swim in,</i>
&lrm;<i>but too runny to float on!</i>

14:07.840 --> 14:09.400
&lrm;I hope it's lactose-free!

14:09.520 --> 14:12.280
&lrm;You're going to drown,
&lrm;softly but surely!

14:12.400 --> 14:16.080
&lrm;Unless, that is, you accept defeat
&lrm;and give me your Miraculous!

14:31.600 --> 14:34.760
&lrm;Do you really think it'll make
&lrm;a difference if I can't see you?

14:34.880 --> 14:38.360
&lrm;There's nowhere to escape!
&lrm;If you don't give me the Miraculous now,

14:38.480 --> 14:41.800
&lrm;I'll simply take them after The Owl's
&lrm;whipped cream has buried you!

14:43.800 --> 14:47.120
&lrm;-He's right. We're done for!
&lrm;-Not yet, we're not.

14:48.360 --> 14:51.040
&lrm;-You win, Dark Owl!
&lrm;-The time has come!

14:51.160 --> 14:52.440
&lrm;Excellent work, Dark Owl!

14:53.960 --> 14:56.000
&lrm;Close your eyes and no peeking.

14:56.120 --> 14:57.600
&lrm;We can't do this!

14:57.880 --> 14:59.120
&lrm;Trust me.

15:02.840 --> 15:04.640
&lrm;Spots off.

15:06.160 --> 15:07.720
&lrm;Claws in.

15:10.480 --> 15:12.320
&lrm;-Huh? What... ?
&lrm;-Shh!

15:22.840 --> 15:25.000
&lrm;<i>Miraculous delivered, sir.</i>

15:27.840 --> 15:33.360
&lrm;Now I am the only superhero in Paris.
&lrm;And a superhero keeps his word. Albert...

15:33.480 --> 15:35.880
&lrm;<i>Owl's whipped cream deactivated, sir.</i>

15:41.760 --> 15:45.640
&lrm;Dark Owl, deliver the Miraculous to me.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.840
&lrm;Albert! Transfer!

15:50.080 --> 15:52.240
&lrm;Mwahaha! I am the best bird!

15:59.680 --> 16:04.880
&lrm;They are mine! Ladybug's ability to create
&lrm;and Cat Noir's power of destruction!

16:05.000 --> 16:07.520
&lrm;Whoever succeeds in merging
&lrm;these two Miraculous

16:07.640 --> 16:10.320
&lrm;shall be granted a wish
&lrm;that can change reality

16:10.440 --> 16:12.440
&lrm;and erase the past.

16:17.720 --> 16:19.800
&lrm;This cannot be!

16:21.720 --> 16:24.240
&lrm;No!

16:25.120 --> 16:28.000
&lrm;Dark Owl,
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir tricked you!

16:28.120 --> 16:31.000
&lrm;These are fake Miraculous,
&lrm;made out of salt dough!

16:31.120 --> 16:33.200
&lrm;Cataclysm!

16:36.760 --> 16:38.160
&lrm;What?

16:39.720 --> 16:43.400
&lrm;-But that's impossible! How did you do it?
&lrm;-Hey! What did you expect?

16:44.000 --> 16:47.640
&lrm;A superhero never reveals her secrets!
&lrm;I thought you'd know better!

16:47.760 --> 16:51.000
&lrm;I've got plan A, plan B,
&lrm;and all the alphabet to Z.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.920
&lrm;Did you really think
&lrm;we'd give you our Miraculous?

16:54.040 --> 16:56.960
&lrm;We're superheroes. We are... Ladybug!

16:57.080 --> 16:58.240
&lrm;And Cat Noir!

17:00.720 --> 17:04.240
&lrm;By the way, say "Hi!" to Hawk Moth
&lrm;for us! Hope he enjoys his new toys!

17:05.000 --> 17:10.560
&lrm;Destroy them, Dark Owl! If you fail again,
&lrm;you can bid your superpowers farewell!

17:10.920 --> 17:14.040
&lrm;Hoomerangs! Trajectory control, Albert!

17:15.240 --> 17:16.920
&lrm;We don't know where his akuma is.

17:17.040 --> 17:19.200
&lrm;But we know it's not
&lrm;in any of his weapons!

17:22.880 --> 17:24.119
&lrm;Cover me!

17:30.920 --> 17:32.600
&lrm;Lucky Charm!

17:38.280 --> 17:40.840
&lrm;The first volume
&lrm;of the adventures of Knight Owl?

17:40.960 --> 17:44.520
&lrm;Do you think you can defeat me
&lrm;by reading to me, Ladybug?

17:44.640 --> 17:45.800
&lrm;[evil laughter]

17:51.480 --> 17:54.000
&lrm;Knight Owl has a partner!
&lrm;So must Dark Owl!

17:58.720 --> 18:01.480
&lrm;-He's all yours, Milady!
&lrm;-Dark Owl's akumatized object

18:01.600 --> 18:03.560
&lrm;is not on him. It's in his lair!

18:03.680 --> 18:06.640
&lrm;Don't let him get away, Cat Noir.
&lrm;I'm off to the school! Ha!

18:07.560 --> 18:10.400
&lrm;See that? Reading comic books
&lrm;can actually save lives!

18:12.320 --> 18:14.040
&lrm;Albert! Owl Wings!

18:16.400 --> 18:17.720
&lrm;Hoo-hoo!

18:25.120 --> 18:27.360
&lrm;Cat versus bird.
&lrm;Who usually wins this fight?

18:27.480 --> 18:29.400
&lrm;Bird! Ha!

18:29.520 --> 18:31.320
&lrm;[shouts]

18:32.360 --> 18:33.960
&lrm;[evil laughter]

18:36.840 --> 18:41.120
&lrm;<i>Intrusion! Intrusion!</i>
&lrm;<i>Intrusion! Intrusion!</i>

18:41.240 --> 18:43.520
&lrm;A computer! Of course!

18:43.640 --> 18:45.200
&lrm;I'm right here, Albert!

18:56.160 --> 18:58.360
&lrm;Dark Owl always triumphs in the end!

18:58.480 --> 19:01.120
&lrm;You should have read to the end
&lrm;of the comic, Ladybug!

19:11.600 --> 19:15.800
&lrm;No! No! No!

19:21.280 --> 19:23.240
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, akuma!

19:26.760 --> 19:28.920
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

19:32.440 --> 19:33.280
&lrm;Gotcha!

19:34.720 --> 19:36.320
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly!

19:36.840 --> 19:38.960
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

19:48.040 --> 19:51.120
&lrm;Ladybug? Cat Noir?
&lrm;What are you doing in my office?

19:51.240 --> 19:52.400
&lrm;Pound it!

19:52.520 --> 19:57.640
&lrm;Ladybug, Cat Noir... Every day,
&lrm;I get closer to destroying you both,

19:57.760 --> 20:01.760
&lrm;and soon you'll be nothing more
&lrm;than superheroes in a history book!

20:03.640 --> 20:07.000
&lrm;<i>And we're happy to announce</i>
&lrm;<i>that this week's winner is, once again,</i>

20:07.120 --> 20:10.240
&lrm;<i>Paris' new superhero, The Owl! Hoo-hoo!</i>

20:10.840 --> 20:15.240
&lrm;Calling us was the right thing to do!
&lrm;Good job, Mr Dam... Uh, Mr Owl.

20:15.360 --> 20:18.760
&lrm;At your service, Captain. Wherever someone
&lrm;needs him, he's right there...

20:19.360 --> 20:20.200
&lrm;The Owl!

20:20.320 --> 20:21.840
&lrm;Hoo-hoo!

20:21.960 --> 20:23.480
&lrm;Hoo-hoo!

20:23.600 --> 20:27.440
&lrm;Hey, Mr Dam... I mean, Owl!
&lrm;Can we take a picture with you?

20:27.560 --> 20:30.760
&lrm;-Say "Hoo-hoo!"
&lrm;-Hoo-hoo!

20:30.880 --> 20:34.800
&lrm;Tending to gardens, handing out blankets
&lrm;to the homeless, feeding animals.

20:34.920 --> 20:38.000
&lrm;-The Owl spread his wings!
&lrm;-He's a superhero in his own way!

20:38.120 --> 20:42.000
&lrm;-Now we'll have more spare time.
&lrm;-Feel like going to the movies?

20:42.120 --> 20:45.320
&lrm;Sorry. I promised a friend
&lrm;I'd hang out with her as soon as I could!

20:45.440 --> 20:46.760
&lrm;See you later, kitty cat!

20:47.480 --> 20:48.680
&lrm;Aw...

20:51.040 --> 20:53.560
&lrm;I'm not kidding, Marinette.
&lrm;I was Cardboard Girl!

20:53.680 --> 20:55.800
&lrm;I wish you could've seen it!
&lrm;It was awesome!

20:55.920 --> 20:58.680
&lrm;Triple dragon kick. Perfect.
&lrm;Marinette wins!

20:58.800 --> 21:01.360
&lrm;What? No way. I wasn't looking.
&lrm;You cheated!

21:01.480 --> 21:03.520
&lrm;[laughter]
