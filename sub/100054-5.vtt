WEBVTT

01:19.688 --> 01:21.211
- MALE RADIO ANNOUNCER: Police
believe the suspect escaped

01:21.255 --> 01:24.258
in a gray sedan and may be
headed to the state border.

01:26.956 --> 01:27.957
- ANNOUNCER: Suspect is armed

01:28.000 --> 01:29.611
and considered
extremely dangerous.

02:41.335 --> 02:43.989
- Not much longer, my love.

02:59.004 --> 03:02.791
- Mm. Not at all
what I expected.

05:11.398 --> 05:14.052
Turn around real slow,
asshole.

05:14.096 --> 05:17.665
- I should think a simple
thank you would suffice.

05:17.708 --> 05:20.232
- Thank you?

05:20.276 --> 05:23.148
Fuck you!
You took my fingers.

05:23.192 --> 05:26.282
- Correction. I saved your hand

05:26.326 --> 05:28.153
and your life while--
- Back away,

05:28.197 --> 05:30.286
or I swear to God
I'm gonna kill you.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.375
Yes, I know you will.

05:32.419 --> 05:36.684
Yes, I'm counting on it.

05:36.727 --> 05:37.946
- Jesus Christ.

05:37.989 --> 05:41.645
- Nope, guess again.

05:41.689 --> 05:44.213
It's Avery Whitlock.

05:44.256 --> 05:45.606
Friends call me Whitey.

05:45.649 --> 05:47.738
Call me Whitey.

05:47.782 --> 05:50.306
- I need your car, Whitey.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.308
- Yeah, the company vehicle,
yeah.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.441
- Give me the keys.

05:54.484 --> 05:58.270
- You're not gonna get very far
tonight in your condition, dear.

05:58.314 --> 05:59.924
- We'll see about that.

05:59.968 --> 06:03.363
- Well not tonight, you see,
the interstate's flooded.

06:05.495 --> 06:09.543
Do you--do you wanna die,
old man?

06:09.586 --> 06:12.981
- Yes. Yes, absolutely.

06:13.024 --> 06:14.112
In the morning,
I'll be dead,

06:14.156 --> 06:15.897
and you'll be on your way.

06:15.940 --> 06:20.597
But first, tonight, join me
for a glass of wine.

06:20.641 --> 06:24.514
You see, you've lost
a lot of blood, Angela.

06:24.558 --> 06:29.737
And you're gonna need your
strength for the journeys ahead.

06:29.780 --> 06:31.913
Besides, I have something
to give you.

06:33.958 --> 06:37.919
- It's a gift that will make
the very gods tremble.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.012
- Come on.

07:01.899 --> 07:04.336
- I've been saving this
for a special occasion.

07:04.380 --> 07:06.948
Tonight is cause célèbre.

07:11.387 --> 07:14.303
- So, you're going to
tell me what this is...

07:14.346 --> 07:15.696
all about?

07:15.739 --> 07:16.827
- Of course, Angela.

07:18.655 --> 07:23.181
Tonight is all about love
and fate.

07:23.225 --> 07:25.445
Do you believe in fate?

07:25.488 --> 07:29.623
That some unseen force--
be it god or karma--

07:29.666 --> 07:32.016
that controls our lives?

07:32.060 --> 07:34.628
- There are no gods.

07:34.671 --> 07:37.718
But then you already know that
given your age

07:37.761 --> 07:40.111
and your profession.

07:40.155 --> 07:41.591
- Who hurt you?

07:45.290 --> 07:47.336
I was admiring
your wedding band.

07:47.379 --> 07:50.774
Was it a loving spouse?

07:50.818 --> 07:53.603
- My spouse is dead.

07:53.647 --> 07:55.170
- I'm sorry.

07:55.213 --> 07:56.693
- So am I.

07:56.737 --> 07:59.174
His death was...

07:59.217 --> 08:02.177
well, it was not the work
of a benevolent god,

08:02.220 --> 08:04.658
Mr. Whitlock.
- Whitey.

08:08.009 --> 08:10.272
What would you do if I told you
that your visit

08:10.315 --> 08:13.405
was not by choice but rather...

08:13.449 --> 08:18.323
a grand design
perpetrated by me?

08:18.367 --> 08:20.021
- I'd say you've been hitting
too much of the good stuff.

08:20.064 --> 08:22.197
- WHITEY:

08:22.240 --> 08:25.983
You know, tonight is
my wife's birthday.

08:26.027 --> 08:29.596
Forty-seven years I was
faithful to that woman.

08:29.639 --> 08:32.990
And, um, I can tell you
something that most men can't.

08:33.034 --> 08:37.386
And that's that I loved her
every day.

08:37.429 --> 08:40.737
Even on days I couldn't
bear the click-clacking

08:40.781 --> 08:44.524
of her dentures----
I adored that woman.

08:47.483 --> 08:51.095
Which makes what I did
all the more unthinkable.

09:21.430 --> 09:22.866
- What is that?

09:22.910 --> 09:25.869
- It's a gift I alluded to.

09:32.136 --> 09:37.054
- You see this paw was
smuggled out of Mumbai

09:37.098 --> 09:40.405
by a former client,
now deceased.

09:40.449 --> 09:44.322
Old folklore tells of
an Indian Fakir

09:44.366 --> 09:47.369
who cast a spell on it,
giving it the power

09:47.412 --> 09:50.459
to grant its host three wishes.

09:50.502 --> 09:54.376
Now, the Fakir wanted to prove

09:54.419 --> 09:57.292
that fate ruled people's lives,

09:57.335 --> 10:00.338
and that those that interfered
did so at their own peril.

10:02.776 --> 10:05.648
Note the clenched fist.

10:05.692 --> 10:08.912
That means that three wishes
have already been granted.

10:08.956 --> 10:10.435
- You're gonna tell me what
this little prop here

10:10.479 --> 10:12.568
has to do
with your late wife?

10:12.612 --> 10:15.092
Almost everything.

10:15.136 --> 10:19.967
You see, like you, I didn't
believe in the power of the paw.

10:20.010 --> 10:22.796
But Marjorie,
she couldn't resist.

10:22.839 --> 10:25.537
She made a couple of
frivolous wishes.

10:25.581 --> 10:28.410
The first was a lost recipe.

10:28.453 --> 10:30.804
And the other, I can't recall.

10:30.847 --> 10:34.764
But the point was that
the wishes came to pass.

10:34.808 --> 10:37.158
A lost recipe?

10:37.201 --> 10:39.247
- I know what you're thinking.

10:39.290 --> 10:44.774
But it was her third wish
that convinced me otherwise.

10:44.818 --> 10:49.779
The third and final wish
born of desperation and fear...

10:55.306 --> 10:56.830
Your move.

11:00.137 --> 11:02.749
- WHITEY: Her business
was dying.

11:02.792 --> 11:06.187
The once harsh winters,
the seasons of our life's blood,

11:06.230 --> 11:09.103
had grown tame.

11:09.146 --> 11:10.887
In the past, one could always
count on

11:10.931 --> 11:13.237
the pipes freezing up
at the senior center,

11:13.281 --> 11:17.677
along with the few of
the seniors if we were lucky.

11:17.720 --> 11:20.418
But after three generations
of service,

11:20.462 --> 11:25.162
the Whitlock Funeral Home was
on the brink of bankruptcy.

11:25.206 --> 11:28.426
And that's when Marjorie
turned to the paw.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.868
- WHITEY: With her final wish
remaining,

11:34.911 --> 11:37.218
she asked for...

11:37.261 --> 11:38.872
- Money.

11:38.915 --> 11:43.267
Send all the money we need
and more.

11:50.361 --> 11:51.885
- WHITEY: Within a week,
I was wealthy.

11:53.800 --> 11:57.151
- Wow, sounds like
a shit load of new customers.

11:57.194 --> 11:59.893
- It was a solitary death.

11:59.936 --> 12:05.812
The insurance payout
on my Marjorie.

12:05.855 --> 12:10.120
- ♪ Oh come all ye faithful

12:10.164 --> 12:14.385
♪ Joyful and triumphant ?

12:14.429 --> 12:17.867
♪ Oh come ye, oh come ye

12:17.911 --> 12:19.651
- MARJORIE:

12:19.695 --> 12:22.306
- ♪ Bethlehem

12:22.350 --> 12:23.699
- Marjorie!

12:32.012 --> 12:36.190
- WHITEY: The paw took hold
of our fate and squeezed.

12:36.233 --> 12:40.498
Squeezed until fate gave her
what she bargained for.

12:40.542 --> 12:44.285
All the money we had
ever needed and more.

12:44.328 --> 12:46.200
- A coincidence.

12:46.243 --> 12:50.291
- Yeah,
like the flooded interstate.

12:50.334 --> 12:52.510
Possibly.

12:52.554 --> 12:55.992
But it's what happened next
that demonstrated

12:56.036 --> 13:00.040
with unmitigated clarity

13:00.083 --> 13:01.868
the true power of the paw.

13:05.132 --> 13:09.876
Each day had become an eternity.

13:09.919 --> 13:13.618
The hours, the seconds--
my cruelest adversaries.

13:19.624 --> 13:21.191
- WHITEY:
I prayed for guidance,

13:21.235 --> 13:23.367
but the answers never came.

13:23.411 --> 13:28.633
Until I received what I
took to be divine intervention.

13:28.677 --> 13:30.679
Christ had risen,
had he not?

13:30.722 --> 13:32.724
Up from the dead?

13:32.768 --> 13:36.076
And here I was
requesting a miracle.

14:03.538 --> 14:04.844
- WHITEY: Christ forgive me.

14:07.237 --> 14:09.849
I wished my Marjorie
back from the dead.

14:17.813 --> 14:20.816
- MARJORIE:
Whitey.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.557
Whitey.

14:33.829 --> 14:37.877
- MARJORIE: Help me.

14:50.759 --> 14:52.195
- Marjorie!

14:56.069 --> 14:59.333
Night after night
I held vigil.

14:59.376 --> 15:02.727
But still, my bride
would not return.

15:02.771 --> 15:06.470
Was I being punished for my
part in this godless affair?

15:10.735 --> 15:13.086
- MARJORIE:
Whitey.

15:36.761 --> 15:38.894
- WHITEY: But several weeks
later while testing

15:38.938 --> 15:40.983
the integrity of
a new product line--

16:35.516 --> 16:36.996
- WHITEY: Horror of horrors.

16:37.039 --> 16:40.825
I wished Marjorie alive,
yes.

16:40.869 --> 16:42.305
But her body would be trapped.

16:57.059 --> 16:58.756
- WHITEY: I had to keep
my wits about me.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.889
One wrong move,
and Marjorie would be locked

17:00.932 --> 17:03.631
inside the Premium Ever Rest
for all eternity.

17:07.156 --> 17:08.505
- WHITEY:
I guarantee it.

17:50.808 --> 17:56.684
- MARJORIE:

17:56.727 --> 17:58.425
- It's me, my love.

17:58.468 --> 18:00.296
I've come to save you.

18:00.340 --> 18:01.950
I'm sorry.

18:01.993 --> 18:04.474
- MARJORIE:

18:04.518 --> 18:05.910
- Here, here.

18:23.450 --> 18:24.886
- It's me, my love.

18:24.929 --> 18:26.757
I've come to save you.

18:30.805 --> 18:36.245
- MARJORIE:

18:45.515 --> 18:50.651
- WHITEY:

18:50.694 --> 18:55.830
- MARJORIE:
- WHITEY:

19:02.880 --> 19:05.318
I love you, Marjorie.

19:05.361 --> 19:08.886
- MARJORIE:

19:27.296 --> 19:28.341
- WHITEY: No!

19:34.564 --> 19:37.176
- As you were, my love.
As you were.

19:54.236 --> 19:57.761
- I tried convincing myself
it was all imagined.

19:57.805 --> 19:59.110
The experience at the grave

19:59.154 --> 20:00.634
no more than
a waking nightmare.

20:04.246 --> 20:07.293
But the weeks
have not been kind,

20:07.336 --> 20:12.036
and I dream about her
every night.

20:12.080 --> 20:16.650
And I see the look on
her face of terror.

20:18.956 --> 20:21.785
Terror that I helped
facilitate.

20:23.483 --> 20:26.007
And the horror.

20:26.050 --> 20:30.490
The horror of her being trapped
in the Premium Ever Rest

20:30.533 --> 20:33.841
for all eternity.

20:33.884 --> 20:35.756
- You guarantee it.

20:35.799 --> 20:37.845
- I guarantee it.

20:37.888 --> 20:41.283
Think I'm a senile
old buzzard, don't you?

20:41.327 --> 20:42.850
- I think you're full of shit.

20:42.893 --> 20:45.069
- Uh.

20:45.113 --> 20:47.158
Wanna see the scar?

20:47.202 --> 20:49.378
Excuse me?

20:49.422 --> 20:52.120
- From the cemetery where
I got the bite.

20:52.163 --> 20:53.426
Wanna see?
- No, I'll pass.

20:53.469 --> 20:54.775
Thank you.

20:58.431 --> 20:59.388
- Ah.

21:04.611 --> 21:07.048
Tick tock.

21:07.091 --> 21:08.919
It's up to you now.

21:40.690 --> 21:42.518
- The interstate's open.

21:42.562 --> 21:44.259
I'll take those keys now.

21:44.303 --> 21:48.785
- Uh, keys are in the hearse
where they've always been.

21:48.829 --> 21:51.527
- Why did you save my life?

21:51.571 --> 21:53.790
- It's Christian charity.

21:53.834 --> 21:56.010
- Bullshit.
- WHITEY:

22:00.667 --> 22:02.886
- Why was I spared?

22:02.930 --> 22:04.845
- You weren't spared.

22:04.888 --> 22:07.543
I invited you here.

22:07.587 --> 22:11.155
I asked the paw
to send me a killer

22:11.199 --> 22:16.160
to relieve me
of my life misery.

22:16.204 --> 22:17.945
Can't do it myself.

22:17.988 --> 22:21.165
Suicide is too great a sin.

22:21.209 --> 22:22.384
- I'm not a killer.

22:22.428 --> 22:24.865
- WHITEY: Oh yes, you are.

22:24.908 --> 22:27.563
I've been following your story.

22:27.607 --> 22:29.391
You've killed before.

22:29.435 --> 22:31.437
And before you leave here today,
you'll kill again.

22:36.485 --> 22:39.793
- Please...

22:39.836 --> 22:41.795
end--end it.

22:45.929 --> 22:47.278
- MAN: Please.

23:13.957 --> 23:15.655
- I love you.

23:25.229 --> 23:26.796
- WHITEY: I can't fight it.

23:29.103 --> 23:32.585
It's our destiny.

23:32.628 --> 23:36.153
- I don't believe in destiny.

23:36.197 --> 23:39.374
But if it'll shut you up.

23:39.418 --> 23:40.636
- Bless you.

23:53.954 --> 23:56.652
- No!

23:56.696 --> 23:58.219
- No, what are you doing?

24:03.137 --> 24:09.056
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

24:11.188 --> 24:15.105
Shoot me! Ahhh!

24:19.893 --> 24:22.852
Shoot me, Angela!

24:27.988 --> 24:32.122
- Thank you.

24:32.166 --> 24:33.907
- No, no, no, no.

24:33.950 --> 24:35.430
No, you can't die.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.388
I'm not a killer.
I'm not a killer!

24:37.432 --> 24:38.999
No, you can't--

25:32.052 --> 25:33.444
- The keys?
Where are the keys?

25:35.621 --> 25:36.839
Oh, what?

25:42.802 --> 25:44.020
- Visor.
Shit, Whitey.

27:33.390 --> 27:36.480
- Get up.

27:36.524 --> 27:37.699
Get up, get up.

27:44.575 --> 27:45.925
Fuck you, Whitey.

28:07.990 --> 28:10.340
No, no, no, no!

29:00.695 --> 29:05.134
- Alright!
Listen up, jailers!

29:05.178 --> 29:07.920
Y'all know me.

29:07.963 --> 29:10.400
It's your old pal,
Lester M. Barclay.

29:10.444 --> 29:11.750
And I ain't never
steered you wrong!

29:11.793 --> 29:13.447
Not once! Not ever!

29:17.538 --> 29:19.583
- Give us mercy, oh lord.

29:19.627 --> 29:21.629
That divine mercy.

29:21.672 --> 29:25.807
Wipe away our sins.

29:25.851 --> 29:27.461
- You got us into this.

29:27.504 --> 29:29.202
I did everything you said.

29:29.245 --> 29:31.944
- I'm gonna get us out it, too,
so you just shut the hell up.

29:36.209 --> 29:37.471
- Hey, y'all know you're barking

29:37.514 --> 29:40.517
up the wrong tree here,
don't ya?

29:40.561 --> 29:42.824
Once this all blows over,

29:42.868 --> 29:46.915
we're gonna fix it no time flat.

29:46.959 --> 29:48.699
Shit!

29:48.743 --> 29:52.573
We all got history together!

29:52.616 --> 29:56.011
We all fought the good fight!

29:56.055 --> 29:59.493
And I was always
here for ya!

29:59.536 --> 30:03.366
Even when nobody else
gave a damn!

30:03.410 --> 30:08.415
- I wish someone would stick
a cork in his ol' fat pie hole.

30:08.458 --> 30:10.939
- It ain't funny, Deke.

30:10.983 --> 30:12.985
- I didn't say it was funny.

30:13.028 --> 30:15.074
I don't think none of this
here's funny.

30:20.122 --> 30:22.385
- Hey, we are running
out of time here!

30:28.043 --> 30:31.046
- The clock is still ticking.

30:31.090 --> 30:33.701
If you don't make
a right choice here,

30:33.744 --> 30:37.705
you don't do what is right
for this town,

30:37.748 --> 30:41.013
and for America!

30:41.056 --> 30:45.017
Let me tell you, there is
gonna be hell to pay.

30:45.060 --> 30:47.149
- LOTTIE: You got that last part
right, baby.

30:50.805 --> 30:53.460
- LOTTIE: You want out?

30:53.503 --> 30:58.769
We can get you out.

30:58.813 --> 31:02.730
You just might wanna back away
from that door for a minute.

31:02.773 --> 31:07.474
Well, look at you now.

31:10.781 --> 31:15.134
Evil devil woman, all high
and mighty all of the sudden.

31:15.177 --> 31:19.529
After everything that has
happened in this world,

31:19.573 --> 31:21.705
you think you got
what it takes

31:21.749 --> 31:24.056
to keep this pot
from boiling over?

31:27.581 --> 31:31.411
Well, from where I stand,
look like you in

31:31.454 --> 31:34.109
way over your head.

31:34.153 --> 31:36.546
- I know who I am.

31:36.590 --> 31:39.767
And I know what you are.

31:39.810 --> 31:44.119
You ain't the mayor of this town
anymore, you piece of shit.

31:44.163 --> 31:46.730
So, you wanna stand
off to the side there,

31:46.774 --> 31:50.125
'cause for once in your life,
all these others come first.

31:52.171 --> 31:54.477
- Oh shit.

32:01.049 --> 32:04.052
- Pastor Mitchell Ryan,
his wife, Susan,

32:04.096 --> 32:08.491
and son, Jimmy, who encouraged
Lester Barclay's reign of terror

32:08.535 --> 32:12.408
by claiming it was God's will.
- WOMAN: No.

32:12.452 --> 32:16.891
- News Director Don Pamade
who willingly spread his lies

32:16.935 --> 32:19.154
with the devil's tongue.

32:19.198 --> 32:21.461
Sheriff Deke and his men

32:21.504 --> 32:25.247
who savagely enforced
his wicked laws.

32:25.291 --> 32:29.121
Raping and murdering countless
numbers of our fellow citizens.

32:29.164 --> 32:31.253
-  No.

32:31.297 --> 32:35.649
- Leslianne Dowd, who spread
the vicious gossip that

32:35.692 --> 32:40.219
resulted in the loss of so many
innocent lives.

32:40.262 --> 32:43.004
- Whoa!

32:43.048 --> 32:47.139
No, no, no, no, no,
y'all--y'all kidding, right?

32:47.182 --> 32:48.488
You're kidding.
- Does it look like

32:48.531 --> 32:51.317
we're kidding,
you fucking traitor?

32:51.360 --> 32:54.668
You're still just a shitty
used car salesman to me.

32:54.711 --> 32:58.324
Now move, you prick!
- Ah!

32:58.367 --> 33:04.025
- CROWD:

33:13.426 --> 33:17.299
- Why don't you just shoot me,
boy, and get it over with?

33:17.343 --> 33:18.648
- You want me to shoot you?

33:18.692 --> 33:20.694
- You know you want to.
Come on, yeah.

33:20.737 --> 33:23.001
- I will, but it won't
get you out of this.

33:23.044 --> 33:26.091
You're going up,
one way or another.

33:26.134 --> 33:28.310
You did it to him.

33:28.354 --> 33:30.834
- You wanna do it, don't ya?
But you can't.

33:30.878 --> 33:32.967
- I'm not asking again!
- 'Cause you're a pussy!

33:33.011 --> 33:34.490
Just like your father.

33:37.493 --> 33:40.583
- It was my baby sister
you raped.

33:40.627 --> 33:42.498
And my--my daddy...

33:45.110 --> 33:49.201
what you did to him...

33:49.244 --> 33:52.595
the way I see it,

33:52.639 --> 33:55.859
my daddy's still
the real sheriff of this town.

33:55.903 --> 33:59.646
And he's up there
waiting for ya.

33:59.689 --> 34:01.561
But you already know that,
don't ya?

34:01.604 --> 34:03.563
- I know that you're a pussy,
boy.

34:03.606 --> 34:05.217
You're a pussy!

34:05.260 --> 34:07.741
Just shoot me!

34:07.784 --> 34:11.310
Preacher. Preacher man.

34:11.353 --> 34:14.400
Now would be a good time
for a prayer.

34:14.443 --> 34:16.880
- I swear to Christ
I didn't say nothing.

34:19.361 --> 34:21.450
I didn't say nothing
to nobody!

34:21.494 --> 34:26.629
- Leslianne, will you
kindly shut the hell up?

34:26.673 --> 34:29.632
- Lottie, please, we can work
something out here.

34:29.676 --> 34:32.331
- Shut the hell up,
Lester.

34:32.374 --> 34:33.854
- No.

34:33.897 --> 34:35.812
- You should have thought
about that before you

34:35.856 --> 34:39.729
subjected these God-fearing folk
to your nasty game.

34:39.773 --> 34:43.907
Held our whole town hostage,
and you forced us to watch.

34:43.951 --> 34:46.171
- No. No, you don't wanna
be doing this.

34:46.214 --> 34:47.955
You know this ain't right.

34:47.998 --> 34:50.740
It's me, your ol' pal,
Lester M. Barclay.

34:50.784 --> 34:52.873
You know what that M
stands for?

34:52.916 --> 34:54.570
Magic.

34:54.614 --> 34:56.094
That's what we got
between us, Lottie.

34:56.137 --> 34:57.747
You and me,
we got magic.

34:57.791 --> 35:00.185
- Hm. Magic?

35:00.228 --> 35:03.405
Now poof, be gone.

35:03.449 --> 35:06.104
Buckle up, everybody,
and enjoy the ride.

35:06.147 --> 35:08.715
- Lottie, we can
make something here.

35:08.758 --> 35:10.717
Lottie, don't walk away.

35:16.418 --> 35:18.899
- MAN: Please, oh my God, no!
Please.

35:27.081 --> 35:29.170
- MAN: Please let me go.
I didn't do anything.

35:31.172 --> 35:32.956
- MAN: Please, I just did
what I was told.

35:54.674 --> 35:56.850
- What are you doing?
You can't do this to me.

35:56.893 --> 35:59.418
You can't do this!
You know who I am!

36:03.073 --> 36:08.035
- Oh me, oh my.
How I love country pie.

36:11.778 --> 36:13.867
- LOTTIE: No one knew
what really caused it.

36:13.910 --> 36:16.217
There were many theories
tossed about on the local news,

36:16.261 --> 36:17.523
but none of that mattered.

36:17.566 --> 36:18.828
People panicked.

36:20.352 --> 36:22.092
All anyone knew was that
the Earth

36:22.136 --> 36:23.877
was spitting out its dead.

36:23.920 --> 36:24.965
Before we knew it,

36:25.008 --> 36:26.836
Musky Holler was being overrun.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.403
It was chaos.

36:28.447 --> 36:30.927
But truth be told, Musky was
already kind of a shit hole.

36:30.971 --> 36:33.365
So, was it really that bad
that it was about to be

36:33.408 --> 36:35.018
wiped off the Earth?

36:35.062 --> 36:37.760
The city council was about
to call in the National Guard,

36:37.804 --> 36:41.024
when Lester M. Barclay stormed
in with a bunch of goons.

36:41.068 --> 36:43.026
- LESTER: Meeting's over,
you piss ants!

36:43.070 --> 36:46.726
Your ol' pal Lester M. Barclay
is taking over.

36:46.769 --> 36:49.859
Someone needs to run this town
the way it needs to be run.

36:52.384 --> 36:55.125
- MALE ANNOUNCER: Now gentlemen,
contestants, the final round.

36:55.169 --> 36:58.128
Tonight, the contest will
finally end, bringing a close

36:58.172 --> 37:01.436
to this most tragic chapter
in our history.

37:01.480 --> 37:04.091
When the change came, we were
all terrified.

37:04.134 --> 37:07.225
And terrified people can make
shameful decisions.

37:07.268 --> 37:10.228
We all know we bear our shame
of the blame.

37:10.271 --> 37:12.882
And we pray
for our Lord's forgiveness.

37:12.926 --> 37:14.623
But we are a God-fearing people.

37:14.667 --> 37:17.800
And God Almighty, how you've
taught us all to fear

37:17.844 --> 37:20.281
your evil ways,
punished the innocent,

37:20.325 --> 37:23.502
and plunged this community
back into the Dark Ages.

37:23.545 --> 37:26.809
We're here to take it back
in the name of Musky Holler,

37:26.853 --> 37:29.464
and in the name of the people
you murdered.

37:29.508 --> 37:34.121
You have reminded us of what
justice truly means.

37:34.164 --> 37:36.906
And it is justice that brings
us together tonight.

37:36.950 --> 37:39.257
To atone for our sins.
- Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

37:39.300 --> 37:40.997
- ANNOUNCER: To make it right.

37:41.041 --> 37:42.782
- LESTER: This ain't right.

37:42.825 --> 37:45.088
You all know this ain't right.

37:45.132 --> 37:48.309
I-I'm Lester M. Barclay.

37:48.353 --> 37:51.834
I'm the mayor of this town.

37:51.878 --> 37:56.404
- Y'all--y'all picked me to
protect you in our darkest hour.

37:56.448 --> 37:57.884
And I did.

37:57.927 --> 38:01.017
- Y'all know I did.

38:01.061 --> 38:04.151
You--you wouldn't be sitting
where you are right now

38:04.194 --> 38:08.155
if I didn't do what I did!

38:08.198 --> 38:13.726
- No, no, you-you-you-you-you
wanted me to do it.

38:13.769 --> 38:17.382
Hell, y'all begged me to do it.

38:17.425 --> 38:20.950
Now, you're gonna make me
the bad guy?

38:20.994 --> 38:24.824
Oh.

38:24.867 --> 38:29.176
I, 'cause--I'll tell you people
something right now!

38:33.049 --> 38:35.008
- Without me,

38:35.051 --> 38:39.882
you ain't nothing but
a bunch of stupid animals.

38:39.926 --> 38:43.582
I did what needed doing.

38:43.625 --> 38:45.975
'Cause I am the only man
in this town that got any

38:46.019 --> 38:48.326
goddamn balls.

38:51.416 --> 38:53.200
- I...

38:53.243 --> 38:57.639
am Lester M. Barclay!

38:57.683 --> 39:01.687
I am the King of Musky Holler!

39:01.730 --> 39:05.517
Y'all love me!

39:05.560 --> 39:07.954
Don't you remember?

39:11.740 --> 39:15.178
I am the fucking...

39:15.222 --> 39:17.746
goddamn king!

39:20.401 --> 39:22.185
- MAN: Who the fuck
do you think you are?

39:22.229 --> 39:24.144
You'll never get away
with this.

39:24.187 --> 39:25.624
- LOTTIE: It all
happened so fast.

39:25.667 --> 39:27.277
Within days, Lester
had gathered up

39:27.321 --> 39:29.497
anyone that could challenge him,
and locked everyone up

39:29.541 --> 39:32.892
under the old high school
football field.

39:32.935 --> 39:34.589
- LESTER: I'm here to tell you
they didn't know how

39:34.633 --> 39:36.025
to keep you safe.

39:36.069 --> 39:37.940
They couldn't keep you safe.

39:37.984 --> 39:39.942
And they won't keep you safe.

39:39.986 --> 39:42.771
Only I can keep you safe.

39:42.815 --> 39:47.820
Y'all will be taken care
of by me, Lester M. Barclay.

39:47.863 --> 39:50.866
I have seen the vision
of our future.

39:50.910 --> 39:54.653
And those that cannot see
will be punished.

39:54.696 --> 39:57.482
With the new world
comes new rules.

39:57.525 --> 40:00.572
We've halted the advance
of the dead after the change,

40:00.615 --> 40:02.356
thanks to me.

40:02.400 --> 40:06.055
You all have your lives
thanks to me!

40:06.099 --> 40:08.841
But there are those who would
have let you die.

40:08.884 --> 40:10.973
Those that did not.

40:11.017 --> 40:13.498
Those that didn't have vision.

40:13.541 --> 40:17.502
They must pay for those
we lost.

40:17.545 --> 40:19.678
- LOTTIE: And with that,
Lester's reign began.

40:19.721 --> 40:22.724
Anyone that challenged him
was taken to the arena:

40:22.768 --> 40:26.293
politicians, doctors,
police, anyone.

40:26.336 --> 40:29.035
And Lester's sick mind cooked up
the ultimate spectacle

40:29.078 --> 40:31.472
to show what would happen
to anyone that didn't share

40:31.516 --> 40:34.257
his vision of the future.

40:34.301 --> 40:35.520
It became a circus.

40:35.563 --> 40:38.174
The end of the world
"Mad Max" kind of stuff.

40:38.218 --> 40:41.221
And Lester and his goon squad
loved every second of it.

40:41.264 --> 40:42.657
We couldn't figure out
what was worse:

40:42.701 --> 40:44.920
them or the dead.

40:44.964 --> 40:47.836
Then came The Game,
and he made them watch.

40:47.880 --> 40:51.100
Turned it into some sort
of sick contest.

40:53.146 --> 40:54.887
- ANNOUNCER: For your crimes
against the people

40:54.930 --> 40:57.324
you pretended to serve,

40:57.367 --> 41:00.806
the town you swore to protect,
and the country you betrayed

41:00.849 --> 41:05.158
through your every word
and deed,

41:05.201 --> 41:09.162
ladies and gentlemen,
for the last time...

41:09.205 --> 41:11.033
Live Pie!

41:13.645 --> 41:15.473
- ANNOUNCER: Looks like they're
coming out of the gate

41:15.516 --> 41:17.736
with an early lead.

41:17.779 --> 41:19.389
Who are they are
gonna get to first?

41:19.433 --> 41:22.523
Ooh, it's Don Pamade!

41:22.567 --> 41:24.960
And next, they go onto
the pastor's family.

41:25.004 --> 41:27.267
His wife-oooh!

41:27.310 --> 41:29.878
And the pastor gets it next.

41:29.922 --> 41:34.404
Ooh, and their son.
Oh no!

41:34.448 --> 41:38.931
Now, for the police officers
that served under Deke.

41:38.974 --> 41:40.802
There goes Bo!
- Please, please.

41:40.846 --> 41:42.151
- ANNOUNCER: There goes Ruth.

41:42.195 --> 41:45.067
- I think Jesus done
lost his chance!

41:45.111 --> 41:46.591
- That ain't funny, Deke.

41:46.634 --> 41:48.723
- I didn't say it was funny!

41:48.767 --> 41:50.508
Ain't none of this funny!

41:53.554 --> 41:55.817
- ANNOUNCER: Now Deke and
Leslianne are up next.

41:55.861 --> 41:59.255
Oooh! And it's Leslianne
that's gonna get it first.

41:59.299 --> 42:02.824
Oh, oh, oh, oh man.
