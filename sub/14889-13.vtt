11:51.566 --> 11:52.800
But...

11:52.833 --> 11:54.633
...there’s something missing.

11:55.833 --> 11:57.566
Me.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.233
Oh, you’re not missing.

11:59.266 --> 12:00.500
You’re right here.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.133
You are heavy.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.366
This sounds like
a cheap come‐on line.

12:08.333 --> 12:09.633
Forget it.

12:09.666 --> 12:11.200
And I’m not heavy.

12:16.066 --> 12:17.133
Don’t tell me.
You’re Bart‐‐

12:17.166 --> 12:18.700
You know,
the minute I saw you...

12:21.333 --> 12:23.066
...I knew you were awesome.

12:24.233 --> 12:28.566
I was, like, oh, wow!

12:28.600 --> 12:30.433
Obliterated.

12:30.466 --> 12:32.600
But there’s
something missing.

12:32.633 --> 12:34.566
And you’re right.
It’s me.

12:38.333 --> 12:40.433
I see you’ve, uh,
met Jennifer

12:40.466 --> 12:41.633
my girlfriend.

12:44.566 --> 12:46.466
And‐and she’s a total babe.

12:48.166 --> 12:51.300
I should know.
I am licensed babe‐tician.

12:51.333 --> 12:53.300
[laughing]

12:55.600 --> 12:58.100
Where do I
come up with them?

13:02.200 --> 13:03.533
Uh, Jennifer,
would you mind seeing

13:03.566 --> 13:05.733
if the rest of
the Cheddar puffs are ready?

13:05.766 --> 13:08.466
Sure, um, nice
meeting you, Bart.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.700
Later, babe.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.666
Oh, wow.
Oh, wow.

13:12.700 --> 13:15.133
Larr, major wipe out
on my part.

13:15.166 --> 13:17.233
Way sorry, dude.

13:17.266 --> 13:20.266
Look, Bart never hits
on another dude’s lady.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.366
Well, I’m happy
to hear that, Bart.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.366
Listen, Larr, I got
some killer news.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.666
I finally got the financial
backing for my project

13:27.700 --> 13:30.366
and I’ll be getting
my own pad this week.

13:30.400 --> 13:33.433
Well, that is killer news.

13:33.466 --> 13:35.500
Well, congratulations.
Who’s your backer?

13:35.533 --> 13:37.166
Everyone! Everyone!

13:37.200 --> 13:39.000
I have an announcement to make.

13:39.633 --> 13:41.100
Uh, Cousin Bartok

13:41.133 --> 13:42.433
would you join me, please?

13:44.666 --> 13:46.566
Hit it, Balkman.

13:46.600 --> 13:50.800
Uh, Cousin Bartok and I are
going into business together.

13:50.833 --> 13:53.800
Um, with his keen
business instincts

13:53.833 --> 13:55.800
and my life savings

13:55.833 --> 13:57.333
I don’t see
how we can miss.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.000
[instrumental music]

14:06.333 --> 14:08.066
[instrumental music]

14:15.766 --> 14:18.400
Okay, cousin, here we go.

14:18.433 --> 14:20.533
Balki, where‐where’s Bart?

14:20.566 --> 14:22.400
It would’ve been nice
if he helped us clean up.

14:22.433 --> 14:24.333
Oh, he’s playing basketball.

14:25.100 --> 14:26.500
Basketball?

14:26.533 --> 14:29.300
‐At 1 o’clock in the morning?
‐Yeah.

14:29.333 --> 14:30.800
He told me he was
going to play

14:30.833 --> 14:34.466
a little one on one with
Ms. Kelly from advertising.

14:39.066 --> 14:40.166
Balki.

14:42.500 --> 14:43.600
We have to talk.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.100
I know what
you’re going to say.

14:45.133 --> 14:47.533
‐You do?
‐Yes, I do.

14:47.566 --> 14:49.333
And I couldn’t
agree with you more.

14:51.400 --> 14:53.400
Cousin, I’m
as tired as you are

14:53.433 --> 14:56.500
of always having
Cheddar puffs at our parties.

14:56.533 --> 14:58.566
Now, I thought,
maybe, we could have‐‐

14:58.600 --> 15:01.500
No, Balki.
No. No. Balki.

15:01.533 --> 15:03.033
Balki. Balki.

15:03.066 --> 15:06.233
I‐I don’t wanna, uh,
talk about hors d’oeuvres.

15:06.266 --> 15:09.333
I wanna talk about
this beach towel business.

15:10.300 --> 15:11.733
You know, it sounds very...

15:12.766 --> 15:14.266
...risky.

15:14.300 --> 15:15.233
Oh, well...

15:15.266 --> 15:17.766
Cousin Bartok and I have
talked about the risk

15:17.800 --> 15:21.066
and we agree it’s
a no‐prob situation.

15:22.333 --> 15:25.366
As he says, you have
to spend money to make money.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.766
Balki, he’s using
the fact that he’s a relative

15:27.800 --> 15:29.600
to take your money.

15:29.633 --> 15:31.466
Cousin, on Mypos

15:31.500 --> 15:33.666
family trusts one another.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.666
Balki, LA
did something to him.

15:35.700 --> 15:37.466
He’s changed.

15:37.500 --> 15:40.233
Cousin, just because he

15:40.266 --> 15:43.566
dresses different
and talks different

15:43.600 --> 15:46.666
and acts different

15:46.700 --> 15:49.000
don’t mean that
he’s different.

15:51.766 --> 15:53.333
Balki

15:53.366 --> 15:56.266
if it walks like a duck
and quacks like a duck

15:56.300 --> 15:58.533
chances are, it’s a duck.

16:05.666 --> 16:09.500
Now, you‐you were talking
about my Cousin Bartok

16:09.533 --> 16:12.200
and then, you’re
talking about a duck.

16:14.333 --> 16:16.466
I know it’s late
and‐and you’re tired

16:16.500 --> 16:19.633
so I’m gonna give
you some time

16:19.666 --> 16:21.300
to organize your thoughts.

16:22.233 --> 16:24.233
[instrumental music]

16:31.500 --> 16:33.700
Larr, dude!
What’s happenin’?

16:35.600 --> 16:38.400
Everything leveled out
and cool, bro‐heim?

16:41.233 --> 16:42.533
Hey, is the Balkster home?

16:44.066 --> 16:47.200
No, the Balkster
is at the bank

16:47.233 --> 16:48.466
transferring his life savings

16:48.500 --> 16:50.500
into his checking account.

16:50.533 --> 16:52.700
Alright, ’cause
I’m psyched to get

16:52.733 --> 16:54.133
the ball rolling on this deal.

16:54.166 --> 16:56.033
I noticed.

16:56.066 --> 16:58.333
Bart, I know
what you’re doing

16:58.366 --> 17:00.366
and I am not gonna
let you get your hands

17:00.400 --> 17:02.100
on Balki’s money.

17:02.133 --> 17:03.366
Oh, wow!

17:03.400 --> 17:05.465
I catch what’s going on here.

17:05.500 --> 17:08.266
I come up
with the most happenin’

17:08.300 --> 17:10.700
outer‐lunar,
money‐making scheme

17:10.733 --> 17:12.333
since the talking teddy bear

17:12.366 --> 17:14.099
and I don’t offer you
a piece of it.

17:14.133 --> 17:15.733
[laughs]
Oh, well, Larr.

17:15.766 --> 17:18.032
You have every right
to be angry.

17:18.066 --> 17:20.000
Mea culpa, amigo.

17:22.133 --> 17:23.532
Larr, I’ll let you in
on the deal.

17:23.566 --> 17:25.000
Go ahead and get your checkbook.

17:30.133 --> 17:32.100
Oh, look,
my two favorite cousins.

17:32.133 --> 17:34.100
I’m so happy
you’re getting along.

17:34.133 --> 17:36.166
Balkman, glad you made it.

17:36.200 --> 17:37.433
I was startin’ to worry.

17:37.466 --> 17:40.100
Oh, don’t worry. Be happy.

17:40.133 --> 17:41.333
It’s check writing time.

17:42.233 --> 17:43.800
Now wait a minute, Balki.

17:43.833 --> 17:45.800
There’s something
you should know.

17:45.833 --> 17:48.066
I did a little investigating.

17:48.100 --> 17:49.666
I called the west coast.

17:49.700 --> 17:51.533
I talked to the designer of

17:51.566 --> 17:53.566
the Piece o ’the beach,
beach towel.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.733
Oh, wow. You talked
to Mr. Greely?

17:55.766 --> 17:59.233
Yes, and according to him,
Bart has absolutely

17:59.266 --> 18:02.266
no marketing rights
to the towel at all.

18:02.300 --> 18:04.766
Cousin, I thought you had
an agreement with Mr. Greely.

18:04.800 --> 18:07.600
But hey, no biggie.
I mean, I get...

18:07.633 --> 18:09.366
Those‐those rights
are just a phone call away.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.533
I can reach out and touch
the dude tonight.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.300
Bart, it won’t matter.

18:15.333 --> 18:17.466
Mr. Greely said he has
no intention of ever

18:17.500 --> 18:18.633
giving you those rights.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.500
Oh, wow!

18:21.200 --> 18:22.633
Major downer.

18:24.100 --> 18:25.733
But hey,
there’s like, you know

18:25.766 --> 18:28.633
there’s like a zillion killer
ideas out there.

18:28.666 --> 18:30.400
Like, I heard‐I heard
one the other day.

18:30.433 --> 18:32.033
Pet rock candy.

18:32.066 --> 18:33.766
Blow my mind!

18:35.800 --> 18:37.133
Balki, with my brains

18:37.166 --> 18:38.300
and you’re righteous bucks

18:38.333 --> 18:39.533
we can make it happen.

18:40.333 --> 18:42.133
Bart, it’s over.

18:42.166 --> 18:44.033
You’re the last person on Earth

18:44.066 --> 18:45.566
Balki would lend money to.

18:45.600 --> 18:47.133
Balki, what are you doing?

18:48.466 --> 18:50.700
I’m writing a check
for my life savings.

18:50.733 --> 18:53.800
‐You’re what?
‐Cousin.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.433
When a member
of your family needs your help

18:56.466 --> 18:58.666
you help him,
no matter what the cost.

19:06.766 --> 19:09.666
Oh, Balki, uh,
you made a mistake.

19:09.700 --> 19:12.300
You‐you made this
check out to‐to Bartok.

19:12.333 --> 19:14.300
And the bank only
knows me as Bart.

19:15.833 --> 19:18.500
No, cousin,
I didn’t make a mistake.

19:21.133 --> 19:23.566
I’m not giving
this money to Bart.

19:23.600 --> 19:25.566
That would be stupid.

19:25.600 --> 19:28.200
I’m giving
this money to Bartok

19:28.233 --> 19:31.433
because I know
that somewhere inside

19:31.466 --> 19:35.133
them fancy clothes
is the Bartok I grew up with.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.800
And I know that, that Bartok

19:39.833 --> 19:41.633
will use this money wisely.

19:49.666 --> 19:51.500
I hate when you do this.

19:53.833 --> 19:55.366
Bart.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.366
Your Myposian accent’s
coming out.

19:58.466 --> 20:00.466
And that means,
the rest of the old Bartok

20:00.500 --> 20:02.433
can’t be far behind.

20:02.466 --> 20:04.533
Come on, cousin.
Come on.

20:04.566 --> 20:05.533
Let it out.

20:05.566 --> 20:08.400
You’ve kept Bartok
locked up for too long.

20:08.433 --> 20:11.100
I have to keep
Bartok locked up.

20:11.133 --> 20:12.366
Bartok is a dork.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.500
Cousin, why would
you say such a thing?

20:16.733 --> 20:18.366
And what is a dork?

20:20.333 --> 20:22.166
A loser.

20:22.200 --> 20:23.533
The only way
I can be a success

20:23.566 --> 20:25.533
is by being Bart.

20:25.566 --> 20:27.733
My‐my friend
Frankie Bathgate says so.

20:28.800 --> 20:30.500
Cousin, excuse me
for saying so

20:30.533 --> 20:32.500
but your friend
Frankie Bathtub

20:32.533 --> 20:35.033
don’t know Dick Butkus
about success.

20:38.466 --> 20:40.566
The only way
to be a true success

20:40.600 --> 20:42.433
is by being yourself.

20:45.566 --> 20:46.700
Yeah, well...

20:48.066 --> 20:49.133
I...

20:49.166 --> 20:50.200
I don’t...

20:50.233 --> 20:53.266
I’m not sure I know
who‐who Bartok is anymore.

20:54.333 --> 20:56.666
I think I lost him
somewhere along the way.

20:58.233 --> 21:02.433
Well, I think I know where
you can find Bartok again.

21:05.666 --> 21:06.766
Mypos.

21:09.733 --> 21:13.066
Well, how I can get back?
I don’t have any money.

21:13.100 --> 21:14.400
Well, I tell you what.

21:14.433 --> 21:16.366
I’ll lend you
the money to go home.

21:19.100 --> 21:20.166
You will?

21:21.766 --> 21:23.433
Thank you, Cousin Balki.

"And make sure you give
Cousin Larry my regards

"and tell him when
I visit America again

come up with them?"

21:54.133 --> 21:57.366
Well, it sounds like Bartok
is happy to be back on Mypos.

22:00.133 --> 22:03.400
Oh, look, cousin,
he sent his business card.

22:03.433 --> 22:06.400
"Bartok’s glow in the dark
sheep collars.

22:08.466 --> 22:11.166
"Never lose a lamb
at night again."

22:13.366 --> 22:16.100
It looks like Bartok
took a little bit of Bart

22:16.133 --> 22:17.166
back to Mypos with him.

22:17.200 --> 22:19.033
Well, of course, he did.

22:19.066 --> 22:20.500
Don’t be bogus, dude.

22:24.200 --> 22:28.033
Balki, promise me you’ll
never say dude again.

22:28.066 --> 22:29.500
You got it.
