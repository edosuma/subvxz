You deserve better than that.

20:11.482 --> 20:13.172
We both do.

20:15.931 --> 20:18.241
Caitlin, it's time
I told you something.

20:18.310 --> 20:21.655

secretly dating someone too.

20:25.103 --> 20:26.517
My boss.

Where?

20:29.275 --> 20:30.931

you were a task rabbit.

20:33.275 --> 20:36.586

on trial here.

20:36.655 --> 20:38.793
- The truth is
is that I'm back in publishing.

20:38.862 --> 20:41.103
- Oh, well,
why didn't you just say that?

20:41.172 --> 20:42.689
- But I had trouble
getting a job,

20:42.758 --> 20:45.206
so I lied about my age.

20:45.275 --> 20:48.206
- Okay.
How old do they think you are?

20:48.275 --> 20:52.413
- 27.

20:55.482 --> 20:56.620

20:56.689 --> 20:58.724

in daylight?

21:01.793 --> 21:04.275
- Look, I've been
wanting to tell you,

21:04.344 --> 21:06.655
but--
- She didn't want to burden you.

21:06.724 --> 21:08.931
Plus, she thought you'd blab.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.517
- Right.

21:10.586 --> 21:12.310
- Honey, I can't
tell you what to do about Greg,

21:12.379 --> 21:14.965
but I can tell you
from my own experience

21:15.034 --> 21:18.034
