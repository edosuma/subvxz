00:02.716 --> 00:04.415
Previously on Damages:

00:04.535 --> 00:06.735
SANCHEZ: I got some stuff
about how the military is

00:06.771 --> 00:08.470
handling soldiers with PTSD.

00:08.506 --> 00:10.706
I can get you interviews. I can
get you whatever you need.

00:10.741 --> 00:12.241
SIMON: If you do, then
McClarenTruth would love to

00:12.276 --> 00:14.176
help you present
this to the world.

00:14.211 --> 00:15.244
I lied about Torben.

00:15.279 --> 00:19.081
He is a very important financial
backer for this organization.

00:19.116 --> 00:21.216
McCLAREN: Why would someone
who provided Princefield with

00:21.252 --> 00:23.452
insider tips also
want to fund us?

00:23.487 --> 00:25.554
SIMON: I would never have made
this arrangement if I had

00:25.589 --> 00:27.790
known you were involved
in that crime.

00:27.825 --> 00:29.158
TORBEN: Soon it will be over.

00:29.193 --> 00:31.927
You'll get everything
that was promised to you.

00:31.963 --> 00:34.496
SIMON: Tell Mr. Herreshoff
I'm not pleased.

00:34.532 --> 00:36.966
You're saying your former
boss tried to kill you.

00:37.001 --> 00:38.867
PARSONS: I believe she
sent someone to do it.

00:38.903 --> 00:41.070
I think this is the blood
from the guy who attacked me.

00:41.105 --> 00:42.271
WILLIAMS: We got a DNA match.

00:42.306 --> 00:43.272
His name's Patrick Scully.

00:43.307 --> 00:45.074
It seems he left town
several years ago.

00:45.109 --> 00:46.875
PARSONS: So there's
no way to locate him?

00:46.911 --> 00:47.876
Who is this?

00:47.912 --> 00:49.812
STEFANIA: No, I don't know him.

00:49.847 --> 00:50.946
I never saw him before.

00:50.982 --> 00:54.049
PARSONS: If you think of anything
else, please give me a call.

00:54.085 --> 00:57.453
STEFANIA: I left Ellen
Parsons' card on the table.

00:57.488 --> 00:59.755
PATRICK: Thank you for this.

01:04.595 --> 01:07.266
PARSONS: The trial is scheduled
to start in a week...

01:09.652 --> 01:12.286
and you haven't
deposed my clients.

01:12.321 --> 01:14.488
HEWES: I'm aware of that.

01:14.523 --> 01:17.324
PARSONS: Well, you've had
plenty of time, so if you ask

01:17.360 --> 01:19.727
for an extension,
I'll fight you on it.

01:19.762 --> 01:23.697
HEWES: I don't
need an extension.

01:23.733 --> 01:27.935
I'm looking forward to
the trial beginning.

01:27.970 --> 01:30.804
I'll depose your
clients this week.

01:30.840 --> 01:35.109
PARSONS: How many days?

01:35.144 --> 01:36.377
HEWES: One.

01:36.412 --> 01:39.246
PARSONS: To depose three people?

01:39.282 --> 01:45.319
HEWES: One day should
be sufficient.

01:45.354 --> 01:48.789
PARSONS: One it is.

01:48.824 --> 01:54.662
HEWES: I see you're making
quite a splash in the news.

01:54.697 --> 01:59.099
I understand some very big
clients may be coming your way.

01:59.135 --> 02:00.301
PARSONS: Yes.

02:00.336 --> 02:04.571
HEWES: Be careful, Ellen.

02:04.607 --> 02:09.443
A taste of success
can be tricky.

02:09.478 --> 02:11.312
PARSONS: Why is that?

02:11.347 --> 02:18.552
HEWES: It makes failure
that much more... painful.

02:21.623 --> 02:25.859
PARSONS: Thanks for the advice.

02:25.895 --> 02:29.330

HERRESHOFF: We're looking forward
to sharing our strategy with you.

04:27.950 --> 04:30.651
Covered derivatives, long spread
commodities-- it's all old news.

04:30.686 --> 04:33.454
We don't want to compete on a
field littered with corpses.

04:33.489 --> 04:37.624
NAOMI: The whole idea of Fund 23
is to carve out virgin territory.

04:37.660 --> 04:40.561
MAN: Find the 14-year-old
girl who will become

04:40.596 --> 04:41.562
the next supermodel, no?

04:41.597 --> 04:44.298
HERRESHOFF: Molto buono.

04:44.333 --> 04:45.833
MAN: Well, I like
what I've heard.

04:45.868 --> 04:47.835
NAOMI: Thank you for
the private showing.

04:47.870 --> 04:49.169
Beautiful works.

04:49.205 --> 04:50.170
Just really beautiful.

04:50.206 --> 04:51.672
MAN: It was my pleasure, really.

04:51.707 --> 04:53.707
So we'll pick up your team
tomorrow morning at your hotel

04:53.742 --> 04:55.642
and we'll go over
the details, okay?

04:55.678 --> 04:57.311
HERRESHOFF: Excellent.
Ciao.

04:57.346 --> 04:58.312
MAN: Ciao, arrivederci.

04:58.347 --> 04:59.246
NAOMI: Grazie.

04:59.281 --> 05:00.981
(speaks Italian)

05:01.016 --> 05:02.850
NAOMI: That went well.

05:02.885 --> 05:04.852
HERRESHOFF: Cocksucker's
on the hook.

05:04.887 --> 05:08.622
If you and Bruce can't reel him
in tomorrow, you're fired.

05:08.657 --> 05:09.923
So, uh, late lunch?

05:09.959 --> 05:14.061
Someone told me about this little
ristorante on the Via Soldati.

05:14.096 --> 05:16.997
NAOMI: Thanks, I'm going to head back to the hotel.
I'm still fighting this jet lag.

05:17.032 --> 05:19.733
HERRESHOFF: Well, what
are you doing later?

05:19.768 --> 05:21.935
NAOMI: Bennett, I told you.

05:21.971 --> 05:23.570
HERRESHOFF: Come on.

05:23.606 --> 05:26.607
We're in Rome.

05:26.642 --> 05:27.608
(ringtone playing)

05:27.643 --> 05:28.842
One last time.

05:28.878 --> 05:32.513
Let's go out in style.

05:32.548 --> 05:34.715
NAOMI: I got to go.

05:34.750 --> 05:37.251
I'll see you tomorrow.

05:42.524 --> 05:47.961
Well, that wasn't how I
thought this was going to go.

05:47.997 --> 05:51.565
This your standard procedure?

05:51.600 --> 05:54.902
You don't do this with everyone
who offers you information.

05:54.937 --> 05:58.705
McCLAREN: No, of course not.

05:58.741 --> 06:01.575
NAOMI: What do you think?

06:01.610 --> 06:04.011
McCLAREN: It was nice.

06:04.046 --> 06:06.780
NAOMI: I mean Fund 23.

06:06.815 --> 06:09.483
If you see our internal
financials, there's a pattern

06:09.518 --> 06:11.785
that can only be explained
by insider trading.

06:11.820 --> 06:16.156
McCLAREN: Well, if I'm gonna help
you, I'll need more evidence.

06:16.192 --> 06:18.358
NAOMI: I can get you
all the documentation.

06:18.394 --> 06:19.359
(knocking)

06:19.395 --> 06:20.360
SIMON: Channing, you up?

06:20.396 --> 06:21.828
NAOMI: Jesus.
McCLAREN: No, it's okay.

06:21.864 --> 06:25.933
It's, uh, it's one of my people.

06:25.968 --> 06:26.934
What's going on?

06:26.969 --> 06:32.739
SIMON: Ready for your interview?

06:32.775 --> 06:33.874
Guess you forgot, huh?

06:33.909 --> 06:36.343
McCLAREN: No, no, no,
uh, I'll be ready.

06:36.378 --> 06:39.079
Just ten minutes.

06:46.984 --> 06:49.043
SIMON: If we could expose Princefield,

06:50.034 --> 06:52.437
that'd be a major coup for us.

06:55.764 --> 06:57.631
However, there is one problem.

06:57.666 --> 06:58.632
McCLAREN: What?

06:58.667 --> 07:01.001
SIMON: You fucked her, Channing.

07:01.036 --> 07:03.103
What in the name of
Christ were you thinking?

07:03.138 --> 07:04.871
McCLAREN: It won't be an issue.

07:04.907 --> 07:06.940
SIMON: How can you
be such a child?

07:06.976 --> 07:10.444
Do you have any idea how many ways
this could blow up in our face?

07:10.479 --> 07:11.912
McCLAREN: You don't
have to worry about it.

07:11.947 --> 07:15.315
SIMON: For the past eight years I've
had to worry about everything you do.

07:15.351 --> 07:17.951
Being your nanny has cost
me my wife, my daughter.

07:17.987 --> 07:19.953
McCLAREN: You're overreacting.

07:19.989 --> 07:24.024
SIMON: You don't get it, do you?

07:24.059 --> 07:29.296
Naomi Walling is a source at one of the
biggest investment banks in America.

07:29.331 --> 07:33.000
If you had any idea what it
takes to be a real journalist,

07:33.035 --> 07:35.235
you would understand how you
may just have compromised this

07:35.271 --> 07:36.737
entire fucking organization.

07:36.772 --> 07:38.171
McCLAREN: All right!

07:38.207 --> 07:39.172
What do you want from me?

07:39.208 --> 07:43.543
SIMON: I want you to stop
behaving like a fucking half-wit.

07:51.219 --> 07:53.186
McCLAREN: You okay?

07:53.222 --> 07:55.155
SIMON: Yeah, fine.

07:55.190 --> 07:56.156
Fine.

07:56.191 --> 07:59.426
McCLAREN: You want to be alone?

07:59.461 --> 08:00.927
SIMON: No.

08:00.963 --> 08:03.263
Come on. Join me.

08:11.172 --> 08:13.607
Give me one of those.

08:34.062 --> 08:37.230
McCLAREN: This leak
was a good one.

08:37.265 --> 08:38.698
SIMON: Yeah, it was fun, huh?

08:38.734 --> 08:42.068
McCLAREN: The way it used to be.

08:46.945 --> 08:49.363
SIMON: This business with Helmut Torben...

08:51.021 --> 08:53.160
I don't know how it happened.

08:54.483 --> 08:56.750
I vetted him, ran the same
background checks as always.

08:56.785 --> 08:59.786
He appeared totally legit.

09:03.124 --> 09:05.826
I'm sorry.

09:05.861 --> 09:07.694
McCLAREN: It's all right.

09:07.730 --> 09:11.898
I know you have my best
interests at heart.

09:28.383 --> 09:32.953
COOPER: Nice grouping, especially
for a concealed-carry piece.

09:32.988 --> 09:34.755
Chris teach you how to shoot?

09:34.790 --> 09:36.656
PARSONS: No.

09:36.692 --> 09:39.192
Another guy I used to know.

09:39.228 --> 09:41.661
COOPER: He taught you well.

09:41.697 --> 09:46.666
So... what can I do for you?

09:48.369 --> 09:50.337
Who is he?

09:50.372 --> 09:53.907
PARSONS: His name's
Patrick Scully.

09:53.942 --> 09:57.878
He did some time for burglary a few
years back and then he left the city.

09:57.913 --> 10:00.247
COOPER: And now you want
me to track him down.

10:00.282 --> 10:01.648
PARSONS: Yeah.

10:01.683 --> 10:03.850
That's his last known address.

10:03.886 --> 10:07.220
COOPER: What does this have
to do with the McClaren case?

10:07.256 --> 10:11.091
PARSONS: It's not
about the case.

10:11.126 --> 10:13.693
It's personal.

10:16.998 --> 10:23.036
COOPER: Look, I like this job,
but I need to know what it

10:23.071 --> 10:25.238
is I'm getting paid to do.

10:28.910 --> 10:33.113
PARSONS: A few years ago,
Scully tried to kill me.

10:33.148 --> 10:34.948
COOPER: Shit.

10:34.983 --> 10:38.151
PARSONS: And the police
investigation went nowhere.

10:38.187 --> 10:41.059
I was just able to get
this information recently.

10:41.692 --> 10:43.306
COOPER: Look... 

10:44.686 --> 10:49.268
I can't get involved
in some vigilante revenge thing.

10:51.033 --> 10:53.733
PARSONS: This guy is dangerous.

10:53.769 --> 10:59.973
I need to know where he
is and what he's doing.

11:10.017 --> 11:12.452
(beeping)

11:12.488 --> 11:15.522
(buzzer sounds)

11:30.238 --> 11:32.205
(click)

11:32.241 --> 11:35.275
(chirping)

11:39.247 --> 11:43.283
PARSONS: The importance of Mr. McClaren's
latest leak cannot be overstated.

11:43.318 --> 11:47.053
The U.S. military has routinely
subjected its own soldiers to

11:47.089 --> 11:48.588
psychological abuse.

11:48.624 --> 11:52.826
MAN: But there have been demonstrations
outside the Pentagon for three days straight.

11:52.861 --> 11:54.828
Does Channing McClaren take
responsibility for this?

11:54.863 --> 11:59.165
PARSONS: My client only takes
responsibility for telling the truth.

11:59.201 --> 12:02.402
These demonstrations simply
reflect the American public's

12:02.437 --> 12:04.037
outrage at learning the facts.

12:04.072 --> 12:08.642
MAN: Mr. McClaren is being sued by
Patty Hewes for wrongful death.

12:08.677 --> 12:11.144
How do you think this latest
leak will affect the lawsuit?

12:11.179 --> 12:14.014
PARSONS: I can't comment on
the specifics of the McClaren

12:14.049 --> 12:16.983
case, but I will say this.

12:17.019 --> 12:21.454
McClarenTruth is going to continue to
hold corrupt institutions responsible for

12:21.490 --> 12:22.455
their actions.

12:22.491 --> 12:25.091
My client is not going to be
intimidated by Patty Hewes'

12:25.127 --> 12:26.593
scurrilous accusations.

12:26.628 --> 12:27.594
(presses key)

12:27.629 --> 12:29.596
HERNDON: Legally
Brunette's on a tear.

12:29.631 --> 12:30.597
(Hewes laughs)

12:30.632 --> 12:34.467
I hear some major clients are
clamoring for her services.

12:34.503 --> 12:36.369
HEWES: Good.

12:36.405 --> 12:38.038
HERNDON: Good?

12:38.073 --> 12:40.941
What's good?

12:40.976 --> 12:43.209
What is this, the
"harder they fall" gag?

12:43.245 --> 12:46.479
HEWES: Is that the Torben file?

12:46.515 --> 12:48.381
HERNDON: Yeah.

12:48.417 --> 12:51.718
There's an article in there that
makes for very interesting reading.

12:51.753 --> 12:54.087
HEWES: Anything I can work
with for the deposition?

12:54.122 --> 12:58.158
HERNDON: See for yourself.

13:03.764 --> 13:09.869
PARSONS: What's it been like at the V.A.
since the leak was posted?

13:09.905 --> 13:13.306
SANCHEZ: It's strange to hear
everyone wondering who did it,

13:13.342 --> 13:17.911
but... all the vets are glad
the information went public.

13:17.946 --> 13:20.914
PARSONS: That must
make you feel good.

13:20.949 --> 13:22.882
SANCHEZ: Yeah, it does.

13:22.918 --> 13:25.619
Seems like it was
okay for you, too.

13:25.654 --> 13:28.421
I keep reading your quotes
in all the articles.

13:28.457 --> 13:33.193
PARSONS: I feel guilty I've
been getting so much attention.

13:33.228 --> 13:39.499
You're the one who
took the risk.

13:39.534 --> 13:40.500
SANCHEZ: Wait a minute.

13:40.535 --> 13:42.636
Where you going?

13:42.671 --> 13:45.939
PARSONS: I've got to get some
work done on the deposition.

13:45.974 --> 13:50.477
SANCHEZ: No, you don't.

13:50.512 --> 13:52.779
(phone ringing)

13:52.814 --> 13:56.316
PARSONS: Shit.

13:56.351 --> 13:58.818
Sorry.

13:58.854 --> 14:01.888
One sec.

14:04.425 --> 14:06.893
Hey, Mom.

14:06.928 --> 14:09.562
Okay, just calm down.

14:09.598 --> 14:12.632
Tell me what's going on.

14:15.703 --> 14:17.904
DENISE: He keeps calling.

14:17.939 --> 14:20.206
Every night.

14:20.275 --> 14:24.944
Lecturing me, telling me how
stupid I am for leaving.

14:24.980 --> 14:27.614
Telling me I've
shamed the family.

14:27.649 --> 14:30.016
PARSONS: Shamed the family?

14:30.052 --> 14:35.388
DENISE: He says I've humiliated him, and
he's embarrassed to be seen at work,

14:35.424 --> 14:36.790
at church.

14:36.825 --> 14:37.924
SANCHEZ: Here you go.

14:37.959 --> 14:39.125
DENISE: Thank you, Chris.

14:39.161 --> 14:40.493
SANCHEZ: Sure.

14:40.529 --> 14:41.761
I'm gonna take a walk, okay?

14:41.797 --> 14:42.762
PARSONS: Okay.

14:42.798 --> 14:43.763
SANCHEZ: All right.

14:43.799 --> 14:48.068
DENISE: Bye.

14:48.103 --> 14:52.439
PARSONS: What happened tonight?

14:52.474 --> 14:56.176
DENISE: He came to the new
apartment, furious, pounding on

14:56.211 --> 15:01.147
the door, screaming
for me to come home.

15:01.183 --> 15:02.615
I was terrified.

15:03.382 --> 15:06.167
Thought he was gonna
smash the door in.

15:06.522 --> 15:08.623
PARSONS: What did you do?

15:09.725 --> 15:11.289
DENISE: I pretended
I wasn't home.

15:12.733 --> 15:15.331
But he...

15:15.914 --> 15:17.345
...sat 

15:18.101 --> 15:21.295
outside my door for two hours.

15:23.238 --> 15:26.372
I watched him through
the peephole.

15:26.408 --> 15:32.245
Finally... he left,
and I called you.

15:32.280 --> 15:33.480
PARSONS: I'm so sorry.

15:33.515 --> 15:35.849
DENISE: I can't go back
to that apartment alone.

15:35.884 --> 15:37.450
PARSONS: No, of course not.

15:37.486 --> 15:38.585
You're staying here tonight.

15:38.620 --> 15:43.189
DENISE: No, I can't keep bothering you.
I... (sighs)

15:43.225 --> 15:45.959
It'll be easier for everyone
if I just go back to him.

15:45.994 --> 15:50.930
PARSONS: Mom, you cannot
give in to him, okay?

15:50.966 --> 15:54.334
That's the whole problem.

15:54.369 --> 15:58.805
He doesn't respect you, and he never
will if you don't stand up to him.

15:58.840 --> 16:03.777
DENISE: How am I
supposed to do that?

16:10.885 --> 16:13.319
GARY: So... (laughs)

16:13.355 --> 16:15.722
This is Parsons &
Associates, huh?

16:15.757 --> 16:18.558
You even got a sign out front.

16:18.593 --> 16:20.026
Good for you, kid.

16:20.061 --> 16:21.194
PARSONS: Thanks.

16:21.229 --> 16:23.329
Why don't you sit, Dad?

16:23.365 --> 16:25.165
GARY: Sit?

16:25.200 --> 16:26.199
Uh-oh.

16:26.234 --> 16:29.602
Sounds like I'm gonna
get a lecture.

16:29.638 --> 16:32.472
PARSONS: I just want to talk.

16:32.507 --> 16:33.973
GARY: Yeah, sure.

16:34.009 --> 16:38.144
Let's talk.

16:38.180 --> 16:40.914
PARSONS: You have
to leave Mom alone.

16:40.949 --> 16:43.650
GARY: I'm sorry. What?

16:43.685 --> 16:46.052
PARSONS: She needs
time away from you.

16:46.087 --> 16:49.189
I know it's hard, but... GARY: No,
it's disrespectful is what it is.

16:49.224 --> 16:50.490
Walking out the way she did.

16:50.525 --> 16:52.892
PARSONS: Dad, I know this is
hard for you to understand...

16:52.928 --> 16:55.161
GARY: Hey, don't
talk down to me.

16:55.197 --> 16:58.698
PARSONS: I'm going to
say what I need to say.

16:58.733 --> 17:02.402
You've never respected Mom.

17:02.437 --> 17:04.704
I've seen you call her
"stupid," "moron," "idiot."

17:04.739 --> 17:06.973
GARY: 'Cause she acts
like a a moron sometimes.

17:07.008 --> 17:10.476
PARSONS: She's tired of all the
judgment, the constant criticism.

17:10.512 --> 17:15.515
No matter how hard she tries,
she can't do anything right.

17:15.550 --> 17:17.851
GARY: Did you talk
her into this?

17:17.886 --> 17:18.984
PARSONS: No, Dad.

17:19.020 --> 17:19.986
She came to me.

17:20.021 --> 17:20.987
(Gary scoffs)

17:21.021 --> 17:23.388
GARY: What does she think
she's gonna do without me?

17:23.425 --> 17:25.290
Support herself at a drugstore?

17:25.327 --> 17:27.292
PARSONS: What's wrong with that?

17:27.329 --> 17:28.560
GARY: Oh, give me a break.

17:28.597 --> 17:30.997
She doesn't want
to be on her own.

17:31.032 --> 17:32.131
She's throwing a tantrum.

17:32.167 --> 17:33.132
That's all.

17:33.168 --> 17:35.268
She wants attention,
just like your sister.

17:35.303 --> 17:38.538
PARSONS: You honestly think that
Mom is just looking for attention?

17:38.573 --> 17:39.672
GARY: Oh, you don't know.

17:39.708 --> 17:44.577
Your mother is very
difficult to live with.

17:44.613 --> 17:49.582
PARSONS: Dad... I love you, I do, but
you've got to be fucking kidding me.

17:49.618 --> 17:51.584
GARY: Don't you talk
to me that way.

17:51.620 --> 17:53.586
PARSONS: You're a
nightmare to live with.

17:53.622 --> 17:55.588
All she ever tried to do was
please you, make you happy, even

17:55.624 --> 17:57.590
when you were treating
her like shit.

17:57.626 --> 17:59.592
GARY: You watch
what you say to me.

17:59.628 --> 18:01.995
PARSONS: And it wasn't just
her; it was all of us.

18:02.030 --> 18:04.697
We were all scared we were gonna
get yelled at, humiliated.

18:04.733 --> 18:07.200
GARY: What, you think because
you've got your own office, and

18:07.235 --> 18:10.103
your name's in the papers,
you can tell me what to do?

18:10.138 --> 18:12.494
PARSONS: No, that's got
nothing to do with it!

18:12.911 --> 18:14.908
GARY: Listen to me, big shot.

18:15.658 --> 18:17.139
Tell your mother 

18:17.259 --> 18:20.822
to come home and to
stop acting like a fucking idiot.

18:32.893 --> 18:36.863
TORBEN: Both Hewes and Parsons
are aware I gave monies

18:36.898 --> 18:40.767
to the McClaren organization.

18:40.802 --> 18:43.169
It is a goat fuck.

18:43.204 --> 18:45.986
HERRESHOFF: That's one
way to put it, yes.

18:49.210 --> 18:52.512
How the fuck did all this
information get out?

18:52.547 --> 18:56.916
You said that Rutger Simon was
going to contain the problem.

18:56.952 --> 18:58.418
TORBEN: Obviously, he failed.

18:58.453 --> 18:59.452
HERRESHOFF: Failed?

18:59.487 --> 19:01.721
Or did he intentionally
let this happen?

19:01.756 --> 19:02.722
TORBEN: Why would he?

19:02.757 --> 19:06.392
He's got as much
to lose as we do.

19:06.428 --> 19:11.331
HERRESHOFF: I'll be damned if I let
that impotent limey prick take me down.

19:11.366 --> 19:12.732
TORBEN: Regardless.

19:12.767 --> 19:15.301
Parsons cannot
afford to expose me.

19:15.337 --> 19:19.038
It would jeopardize her case, so
taking action against her would

19:19.074 --> 19:20.306
only increase the risk.

19:20.342 --> 19:24.210
HERRESHOFF: And Patty Hewes?

19:24.245 --> 19:27.246
TORBEN: Hewes is
focused on McClaren.

19:27.282 --> 19:28.448
HERRESHOFF: For now.

19:28.483 --> 19:33.853
I don't know how long
we can rely on that.

19:41.462 --> 19:42.929
(beeping)

19:42.964 --> 19:46.099
(buzzer sounding)

19:50.204 --> 19:53.606
(beeping)

20:01.382 --> 20:04.717
(buzzer sounding)

20:05.386 --> 20:07.487
MAN (on TV): ...prime
minister says his country is

20:07.522 --> 20:11.024
setting up a $10 billion
credit line for...

20:13.594 --> 20:15.628
(door creaks shut)

20:15.663 --> 20:20.233
...infrastructure projects, new
technologies and green energy...

20:23.137 --> 20:25.171
(TV continues playing quietly)

20:47.628 --> 20:52.698
MAN (over TV): ...the Hungarian chemicals
manufacturer in a $1.6 billion deal.

20:52.734 --> 20:57.203
In Serbia, the biggest Chinese
investment is a $225 million

20:57.238 --> 21:00.173
bridge over the Danube
River in Belgrade.

21:00.208 --> 21:04.510
Other projects in the region include
construction of car and TV...

21:04.546 --> 21:06.579
(TV continues quietly)

21:31.672 --> 21:33.706
(door creaks)

21:43.884 --> 21:45.885
FRANKLIN: Hey.

21:45.920 --> 21:47.787
PARSONS: Hey.

21:47.822 --> 21:50.089
FRANKLIN: You got to
the office early.

21:50.125 --> 21:54.026
PARSONS: Yeah, I wanted to get a
jump start on the deposition.

21:54.062 --> 21:55.962
FRANKLIN: Are you okay?

21:55.997 --> 21:58.698
PARSONS: Yeah, fine.

21:58.733 --> 22:01.501
Just feeling a little off.

22:01.536 --> 22:05.671
FRANKLIN: It's been going
on for a few weeks.

22:05.707 --> 22:09.275
PARSONS: Being outside helps.

22:09.310 --> 22:13.446
FRANKLIN: Maybe you should go and see
a doctor, get yourself checked out.

22:16.583 --> 22:19.685
PARSONS: Look what I found.

22:22.689 --> 22:26.159
FRANKLIN: That's
a pigeon's nest.

22:26.194 --> 22:31.664
Funny, you almost
never see those.

22:33.934 --> 22:36.135
(cooing)

22:36.171 --> 22:38.437
(siren whooping)

22:46.446 --> 22:48.214
HEWES: When did you first
become aware of Naomi Walling?

22:48.249 --> 22:50.449
McCLAREN: She contacted
me while I was in Rome.

22:50.485 --> 22:53.686
She said she had knowledge of insider
trading at Princefield Bank.

22:53.721 --> 22:56.522
HEWES: And did you express
interest in this information?

22:56.558 --> 22:59.725
McCLAREN: Absolutely.

22:59.761 --> 23:01.894
SIMON: But we informed her
that if she wanted to help

23:01.930 --> 23:05.131
expose Fund 23, she would
need more documentation.

23:05.166 --> 23:07.266
McCLAREN: So she procured
additional evidence.

23:07.302 --> 23:09.936
Then she asked for a
meeting in New York.

23:09.971 --> 23:12.438
HEWES: And did you meet?

23:12.473 --> 23:15.675
NOVAK: No, I never
met Ms. Walling.

23:15.710 --> 23:18.444
My job was to help coordinate
the technical team while we

23:18.479 --> 23:20.780
waited for the Princefield
information to arrive.

23:20.815 --> 23:22.982
McCLAREN: But we weren't sure
the information would arrive.

23:23.017 --> 23:26.085
SIMON: She was having second
thoughts about following through.

23:26.120 --> 23:27.787
McCLAREN: So I met with her.

23:27.822 --> 23:30.089
HEWES: Where did this
meeting take place?

23:30.124 --> 23:31.657
McCLAREN: The Montclair Hotel.

23:31.693 --> 23:33.359
SIMON: I was entirely
unaware of it.

23:33.394 --> 23:35.561
NOVAK: I didn't know they
met until weeks later.

23:35.597 --> 23:38.130
McCLAREN: I felt
I had no choice.

23:38.166 --> 23:40.333
Naomi wanted reassurance
face-to-face.

23:40.368 --> 23:43.102
HEWES: And in this meeting, you
sexually assaulted Ms. Walling?

23:43.137 --> 23:45.371
McCLAREN: We had no sexual
contact whatsoever.

23:45.406 --> 23:47.673
SIMON: The accusation is ludicrous.
NOVAK: That never happened.

23:47.709 --> 23:53.746
McCLAREN: She said she would go
through with the leak, and I left.

23:53.781 --> 23:55.715
HEWES: Thank you.

23:55.750 --> 23:57.783
I have no more questions.

24:02.889 --> 24:04.757
NOVAK: That's all?

24:04.792 --> 24:06.058
HEWES: That's all.

24:06.094 --> 24:08.494
McCLAREN: So we're done here?

24:08.529 --> 24:10.196
SIMON: I can go?

24:10.231 --> 24:11.931
HEWES: Uh, no.

24:11.966 --> 24:14.233
No, Mr. Simon, not quite yet.

24:14.269 --> 24:19.071
There's one more topic I'd
like to discuss with you.

24:22.576 --> 24:25.645
HEWES: Do you know this man?

24:25.680 --> 24:26.379
SIMON: Yes.

24:26.414 --> 24:28.047
His name's Helmut Torben.

24:28.082 --> 24:30.750
He is one of our primary donors.

24:30.785 --> 24:32.551
HEWES: How did you
meet Mr. Torben?

24:32.587 --> 24:34.587
SIMON: About a year ago,
he reached out to me.

24:34.622 --> 24:40.159
He strongly believed in what Channing
was doing, and wanted to fund us.

24:40.194 --> 24:45.398
HEWES: I imagine when you take on
a new donor, you research them?

24:45.433 --> 24:46.766
SIMON: Extensively.

24:46.801 --> 24:49.335
Due diligence can take months.

24:49.370 --> 24:51.404
HEWES: So I'm sure you
discovered that Mr. Torben had

24:51.439 --> 24:57.476
a financial relationship with Bennett
Herreshoff, the CEO of Princefield Bank.

24:59.880 --> 25:01.914
SIMON: No, I did not.

25:10.223 --> 25:14.427
HEWES: Mr. Simon, would you
look over this, please.

25:14.462 --> 25:18.431
It's an article that appeared in
The Wall Street Journal dated

25:18.466 --> 25:20.800
September 7, 1987.

25:23.937 --> 25:25.971
Can you tell me what it says?

25:30.243 --> 25:35.381
SIMON: Apparently, 25 years
ago, Helmut Torben secured...

25:35.416 --> 25:39.285
financiers for a hedge fund
run by Bennett Herreshoff.

25:39.320 --> 25:42.455
PARSONS: May I see that?

25:44.891 --> 25:47.593
HEWES: Mr. Simon, you posted a
leak about insider trading at

25:47.628 --> 25:52.598
Fund 23, and your main donor had
financial dealings with the CEO

25:52.633 --> 25:55.801
of the bank that
managed that fund.

25:55.837 --> 26:00.473
Do you recognize that as an
enormous conflict of interest?

26:03.310 --> 26:04.910
SIMON: Well, I suppose
one could say that.

26:04.946 --> 26:07.980
But as I've said, I had
no knowledge of it.

26:08.015 --> 26:11.117
HEWES: Well, I find that
very hard to believe.

26:11.152 --> 26:15.454
It's your responsibility to oversee
finances, is that correct?

26:15.490 --> 26:16.956
SIMON: Yes.

26:16.991 --> 26:20.826
HEWES: So either this was an
egregious oversight on your part

26:20.862 --> 26:23.596
or something more
sinister was involved.

26:23.631 --> 26:24.497
PARSONS: Objection.

26:24.532 --> 26:27.433
Please refrain from
lecturing the witness.

26:27.468 --> 26:29.168
Ask a question.

26:29.203 --> 26:31.971
HEWES: When you brought on
Mr. Torben as a donor, were you

26:32.006 --> 26:37.643
simply negligent or were you
intentionally serving his agenda?

26:37.678 --> 26:39.578
SIMON: What agenda
would that be?

26:39.614 --> 26:43.048
HEWES: If Mr. Torben wanted
to discredit Naomi Walling,

26:43.084 --> 26:49.655
wouldn't the leak of her personal
information accomplish just that?

26:49.690 --> 26:52.358
SIMON: We would have no reason
to participate in such a thing.

26:52.393 --> 26:54.093
HEWES: So your negligence
wasn't devious.

26:54.128 --> 26:54.927
SIMON: Certainly not.

26:54.962 --> 26:56.662
HEWES: Just wildly incompetent.

26:56.697 --> 26:57.663
SIMON: I didn't say that.

26:57.698 --> 27:00.433
HEWES: You haven't really said much
of anything, have you, Mr. Simon?

27:00.468 --> 27:03.836
Because you can't explain
yourself, can you?

27:09.151 --> 27:10.974
HEWES: I promise you, Mr. Simon,

27:11.594 --> 27:15.581
I will pursue this matter 
through the trial and beyond.

27:18.085 --> 27:20.619
If you are aware Mr. Torben
played any role in this

27:20.655 --> 27:23.322
leak, you better tell me now.

27:23.357 --> 27:25.925
SIMON: I'm aware of nothing.

27:31.264 --> 27:33.532
HEWES: No more questions.

27:40.040 --> 27:43.075
TORBEN: What can I do
for you, Ms. Parsons?

27:45.846 --> 27:50.416
PARSONS: Let's start with
insider trading at Fund 23.

27:50.451 --> 27:52.485
You supplied the stock tips.

27:52.520 --> 27:54.420
(Torben chuckles)

27:54.455 --> 27:56.789
TORBEN: That is a bare falsehood.

27:56.824 --> 27:59.058
PARSONS: I'm not interested
in your denials, Mr. Torben.

27:59.093 --> 28:00.726
And Patty Hewes won't be either.

28:00.761 --> 28:03.095
She deposed Mr. Simon today.

28:03.130 --> 28:04.563
It didn't go well.

28:04.599 --> 28:07.533
So perhaps you can explain why
you would fund a Web site that

28:07.568 --> 28:09.835
could expose your own
illegal activity.

28:09.871 --> 28:13.005
TORBEN: I told you...
I provided no tips.

28:13.040 --> 28:14.473
PARSONS: Bullshit.

28:14.509 --> 28:17.042
Did Rutger Simon know about
the insider trading?

28:17.078 --> 28:19.378
I can't protect you
unless I know the truth.

28:19.413 --> 28:24.350
TORBEN: My dear, you know
all you need to know.

28:24.385 --> 28:27.152
PARSONS: You're a
criminal, Mr. Torben.

28:27.188 --> 28:28.420
(Torben chuckles)

28:28.456 --> 28:32.091
And, unfortunately, we have
similar interests right now.

28:35.462 --> 28:38.697
But that could very well change.

28:38.733 --> 28:41.267
TORBEN: Why would that change?

28:41.302 --> 28:46.805
PARSONS: Because Patty Hewes may try
and enlist you against McClaren.

28:46.841 --> 28:50.643
And she can be very persuasive.

28:50.678 --> 28:56.549
TORBEN: I have long experience
resisting the charms of women.

28:56.584 --> 29:00.019
PARSONS: Good.

29:00.054 --> 29:05.791
Because if you do find a way to fuck up my case...
I'll go to my friends

29:05.826 --> 29:10.229
at the D.A.'s office and
you'll go to prison.

29:23.476 --> 29:24.944
SIMON: What we doing out here?

29:24.979 --> 29:26.378
It's fucking freezing.

29:26.414 --> 29:30.950
McCLAREN: I read the
transcript of your deposition.

29:30.985 --> 29:34.053
Did you know Torben had a
relationship with Herreshoff?

29:34.088 --> 29:35.921
SIMON: No, of course not.

29:35.957 --> 29:38.057
McCLAREN: I don't know
if I believe you.

29:38.092 --> 29:38.824
SIMON: Why?

29:38.859 --> 29:41.994
Because Patty Hewes slings around
accusations in a deposition?

29:42.029 --> 29:42.761
McCLAREN: No, no, no, no.

29:42.797 --> 29:44.496
Because she asked you questions
that you couldn't answer.

29:44.532 --> 29:47.199
SIMON: So what do you
think, Channing? Hmm?

29:47.234 --> 29:51.337
That I conspired with Torben
and Herreshoff? For what?

29:51.372 --> 29:52.404
Why would I do that?

29:52.440 --> 29:54.173
McCLAREN: I don't know.

29:54.208 --> 29:58.010
But if nothing else, you failed the
organization when you brought Torben in.

29:58.045 --> 30:00.479
SIMON: After
everything I've done.

30:00.514 --> 30:02.047
You had nothing when you met me.

30:02.083 --> 30:04.249
You were a clueless kid with
a genius for computers.

30:04.285 --> 30:05.684
And how do you thank me?

30:05.720 --> 30:09.288
By behaving like a reckless
prick, using the celebrity that

30:09.323 --> 30:14.460
I created for you to throw a hump at
every piece of scut that looks your way.

30:14.495 --> 30:16.028
McCLAREN: You sound a
little jealous, Rutger.

30:16.063 --> 30:19.031
SIMON: Fuck off.

30:19.066 --> 30:22.134
McClarenTruth has always
been more mine than yours.

30:22.169 --> 30:24.470
You know that as well as I do.

30:28.808 --> 30:30.609
McCLAREN: You're fired.

30:30.645 --> 30:31.677
SIMON: Fired?

30:31.712 --> 30:33.245
You having a laugh?

30:33.280 --> 30:35.514
How are you gonna run the
organization without me?

30:35.549 --> 30:37.416
Just you and your little
Aussie fuckbuddy?

30:37.451 --> 30:40.052
McCLAREN: We'll manage.
SIMON: How? What will you do for funds?

30:40.087 --> 30:40.919
McCLAREN: We have funds.

30:40.955 --> 30:42.588
SIMON: How you
gonna access them?

30:42.623 --> 30:44.823
I can't write a check without
your signature, same as you

30:44.859 --> 30:46.291
can't write a check
without mine.

30:46.327 --> 30:47.960
Why do you think I
arranged it that way?

30:47.995 --> 30:50.396
McCLAREN: Whatever it is that
you think you created, without

30:50.431 --> 30:53.165
my name, my face,
you're nothing.

30:53.200 --> 30:55.267
So fuck you.

30:55.302 --> 30:56.769
I'm Channing McClaren.

30:56.804 --> 31:01.640
Where I go, the Web
site goes with me.

31:06.680 --> 31:07.913
(knocking)

31:07.948 --> 31:09.248
PARSONS: Come in.

31:09.283 --> 31:12.584
COOPER: Found Patrick Scully.

31:12.620 --> 31:14.319
PARSONS: Where?

31:14.355 --> 31:18.557
COOPER: Right here in the city.

31:18.592 --> 31:20.426
PARSONS: He came back?

31:20.461 --> 31:22.127
How do you know?

31:22.163 --> 31:23.429
COOPER: You were right.

31:23.464 --> 31:24.797
That old lady lied to you.

31:24.832 --> 31:26.532
Stefania McKee does know him.

31:26.567 --> 31:28.200
Scully's been there twice.

31:28.235 --> 31:30.269
Brought her groceries.

31:33.406 --> 31:34.707
PARSONS: Where's he staying?

31:34.742 --> 31:37.810
COOPER: Tailed him to a
place in Marine Park.

31:40.246 --> 31:43.048
What now?

31:43.084 --> 31:45.617
PARSONS: I need you
to follow him.

31:45.653 --> 31:46.885
Track his movements.

31:46.921 --> 31:48.954
Around the clock.

31:51.424 --> 31:52.658
Money's not an issue.

31:52.693 --> 31:53.959
Whatever you need.

31:53.994 --> 31:56.228
COOPER: Okay.

31:56.263 --> 32:00.099
PARSONS: Just don't let
him out of your sight.

32:00.134 --> 32:03.769
COOPER: He won't come
anywhere near you.

32:16.816 --> 32:19.685
SIMON: I care about Channing.

32:19.720 --> 32:22.688
I do.

32:22.723 --> 32:27.659
But I care about the
organization more.

32:27.695 --> 32:33.165
I can't protect him any longer.

32:33.200 --> 32:36.635
HEWES: What exactly are
you protecting him from?

32:36.670 --> 32:40.606
SIMON: I'm not sure
where to begin.

32:40.641 --> 32:46.111
HEWES: Why don't you
begin with Rome.

32:46.147 --> 32:47.946
SIMON: Rome.

32:47.982 --> 32:49.381
Right.

32:49.416 --> 32:52.985
Well, as you know, that's where
Channing first met Naomi Walling.

32:53.020 --> 32:57.189
She'd contacted him directly, and
he met her without my knowledge.

32:57.224 --> 32:59.925
I should have stopped
all of this then.

32:59.960 --> 33:03.362
If you had any idea what it
takes to be a real journalist,

33:03.397 --> 33:06.031
you would understand how you
may just have compromised this

33:06.066 --> 33:07.599
entire fucking organization.

33:07.635 --> 33:08.600
McCLAREN: All right!

33:08.636 --> 33:09.635
What do you want from me?

33:09.670 --> 33:13.772
SIMON: I want you to stop
behaving like a fucking half-wit.

33:20.747 --> 33:22.447
(sighs)

33:22.483 --> 33:25.684
McCLAREN: It won't happen again.

33:25.719 --> 33:26.985
SIMON: It better not.

33:27.021 --> 33:29.087
McCLAREN: But I'm not
abandoning this leak.

33:29.123 --> 33:30.489
It's too big.

33:30.524 --> 33:34.993
Too important.

33:35.029 --> 33:37.796
SIMON: Yeah, all right, fine.

33:37.832 --> 33:41.033
But from here on out, Walling
interacts only with me.

33:43.203 --> 33:47.639
HEWES: So, you agreed to
go forward with the leak.

33:47.675 --> 33:49.474
SIMON: Unfortunately, yes.

33:49.510 --> 33:55.514
HEWES: And back in New York, what
really happened at the Montclair Hotel?

33:55.549 --> 33:59.384
SIMON: I wasn't there,
so I can't say for sure.

34:03.890 --> 34:07.259
But I saw Channing
right afterwards.

34:11.898 --> 34:13.331
SIMON: Where were you?

34:13.367 --> 34:14.399
McCLAREN: I fucked up.

34:14.435 --> 34:15.534
SIMON: Why? What happened?

34:15.569 --> 34:19.605
McCLAREN: Uh, Naomi Walling contacted
me again, uh... She wanted to meet.

34:19.639 --> 34:21.907
SIMON: And did you?

34:21.942 --> 34:23.108
McCLAREN: Yes.

34:23.143 --> 34:25.844
SIMON: Jesus, Channing...
McCLAREN: She's angry.

34:25.880 --> 34:28.580
I'm afraid she's gonna go to the
police, say I assaulted her.

34:28.616 --> 34:31.083
SIMON: Why the hell
would she say that?

34:31.118 --> 34:32.484
McCLAREN: She came onto me.

34:32.518 --> 34:33.652
Things got out of control.

34:33.687 --> 34:36.355
SIMON: Channing... If she calls the
police, if you get arrested...

34:36.389 --> 34:38.357
McCLAREN: It was a
misunderstanding.

34:38.391 --> 34:39.424
SIMON: That won't matter.

34:39.460 --> 34:41.426
You were alone with
her in a hotel room.

34:41.462 --> 34:42.793
All she has to do is accuse you.

34:42.830 --> 34:46.130
Your enemies can then use
that to destroy you.

34:46.166 --> 34:50.502
McCLAREN: I need the codes you
gave her to upload the leak.

34:50.536 --> 34:51.536
SIMON: What for?

34:51.572 --> 34:54.639
McCLAREN: Just give me
the goddamned codes.

34:58.678 --> 35:02.981
HEWES: And did you
give him the codes?

35:03.017 --> 35:05.017
SIMON: Stupidly, yes.

35:05.052 --> 35:06.385
We received the leak.

35:06.420 --> 35:07.586
We scoured it, vetted it.

35:07.621 --> 35:10.355
It was all legitimate.

35:10.391 --> 35:14.760
But later that night, I saw
Channing at his laptop.

36:02.208 --> 36:08.013
HEWES: So, Channing
posted Naomi's emails.

36:08.048 --> 36:12.217
SIMON: Yes.

36:12.252 --> 36:14.653
HEWES: How did he get them?

36:14.688 --> 36:16.388
SIMON: He's a master.

36:16.423 --> 36:20.258
He simply hacked
into her system.

36:20.294 --> 36:22.661
HEWES: Why did he do it?

36:22.696 --> 36:25.097
SIMON: To discredit
Naomi Walling.

36:25.132 --> 36:27.799
If she was going to go to the
police and accuse him of sexual

36:27.835 --> 36:32.270
assault, he wanted to paint
her as a Wall Street slut.

36:39.345 --> 36:42.614
HEWES: Mr. Simon, why are
you telling me all this?

36:42.649 --> 36:48.920
SIMON: I'll testify for you against
Channing, but I want something in return.

36:48.956 --> 36:51.189
HEWES: What's that?

36:51.225 --> 36:54.259
SIMON: I believe
deeply in our cause.

36:54.294 --> 36:58.130
If I give you Channing, I want
the organization to continue.

36:58.165 --> 37:00.365
And I want to run it.

37:00.401 --> 37:02.601
Responsibly.

37:02.636 --> 37:05.670
But I'm going to need funding.

37:14.914 --> 37:18.683
HEWES: I think we can
come to an arrangement.

37:18.719 --> 37:20.819
(banging on door)

37:20.854 --> 37:22.888
GARY: Open the door.

37:27.360 --> 37:28.260
Where is she?

37:28.295 --> 37:29.261
PARSONS: She's not here.

37:29.296 --> 37:30.262
GARY: Bullshit.

37:30.297 --> 37:32.264
PARSONS: You're
wasting your time.

37:32.299 --> 37:34.266
GARY: I know you're
protecting her.

37:34.301 --> 37:35.267
PARSONS: Yes, I am.

37:35.302 --> 37:36.268
She's in a hotel.

37:36.303 --> 37:36.968
GARY: Which one?

37:37.004 --> 37:38.036
PARSONS: I'm not telling you.

37:38.072 --> 37:39.938
GARY: Which fucking hotel?

37:39.973 --> 37:41.873
DENISE: Gary, stop, please.

37:41.909 --> 37:44.009
PARSONS: Jesus, Mom,
go back to your room.

37:44.044 --> 37:46.011
GARY: So, now you're
lying for her?

37:46.046 --> 37:47.012
DENISE: Don't blame Ellen.

37:47.047 --> 37:48.113
GARY: Believe me.

37:48.148 --> 37:49.281
You're the one I blame.

37:49.316 --> 37:51.283
PARSONS: Okay, Dad,
just leave her alone.

37:51.318 --> 37:53.385
GARY: You file for divorce,
and you don't even tell me?

37:53.420 --> 37:55.320
I have to find out through
the fucking mail?

37:55.355 --> 37:57.055
PARSONS: Okay, Dad,
you can leave.

37:57.091 --> 37:58.290
GARY: Shut up!

37:58.325 --> 37:59.424
You listen to me.

37:59.460 --> 38:00.826
There's not gonna be a divorce.

38:00.861 --> 38:01.827
DENISE: Please, just go.

38:01.862 --> 38:02.861
We'll talk later.

38:02.896 --> 38:05.130
GARY: You're gonna
come home with me now.

38:05.165 --> 38:06.231
PARSONS: She's staying here.

38:06.266 --> 38:08.767
GARY: Stop acting like a
fucking child and come home.

38:08.802 --> 38:13.872
PARSONS: Dad, I'm warning... GARY:
You mind your own fucking business.

38:13.907 --> 38:18.009
You come with me now, or I'm gonna
drag your fat ass out of here.

38:18.045 --> 38:19.478
DENISE: Okay, okay,
just stop yelling.

38:19.513 --> 38:20.278
PARSONS: Dad.

38:20.314 --> 38:21.413
GARY: Shut up!

38:21.448 --> 38:23.281
PARSONS: Get the fuck out!

38:23.317 --> 38:30.122
DENISE: Ellen...
PARSONS: Get out!

38:30.157 --> 38:32.657
GARY: What the hell
are you doing?

38:32.693 --> 38:35.627
You think you're gonna
kill your father?

38:35.662 --> 38:36.862
PARSONS: Kill you?

38:36.897 --> 38:38.029
No.

38:38.065 --> 38:41.833
But New York State Law recognizes the
justifiable use of proportional force in

38:41.869 --> 38:43.001
self-defense.

38:43.036 --> 38:46.371
So, I could certainly shoot you
if you don't get out of here.

38:46.406 --> 38:47.973
The arm.

38:48.008 --> 38:49.774
Leg.

38:49.810 --> 38:51.943
Where do you want it, Dad?

38:51.979 --> 38:55.013
I promise you I won't miss.

39:01.254 --> 39:03.288
GARY: This isn't over.

39:12.265 --> 39:15.300
(door opens, closes)

39:36.289 --> 39:38.523
McCLAREN: I'm not
abandoning this leak.

39:38.559 --> 39:41.393
It's too big, too important.

39:44.664 --> 39:46.698
SIMON: Yeah, all right, fine.

39:46.733 --> 39:50.402
But from here on out, Walling
interacts only with me.

40:09.956 --> 40:11.990
(speaking Italian)

40:15.895 --> 40:18.430
HERRESHOFF: Mr. Simon.

40:18.465 --> 40:21.199
SIMON: Thank you for
meeting with me.

40:21.235 --> 40:23.235
HERRESHOFF: Your phone
call piqued my interest.

40:23.270 --> 40:27.592
Can't imagine at McClarenTruth
would want with me.

40:29.962 --> 40:33.063
SIMON: We've been approached by
a source who has evidence

40:33.183 --> 40:35.573
of insider trading at Princefield,

40:36.130 --> 40:39.396
specifically, your Fund 23 division.

40:40.254 --> 40:43.388
HERRESHOFF: What do you
want with me, Mr. Simon?

40:43.423 --> 40:45.757
SIMON: I have a
proposal for you.

40:45.792 --> 40:49.327
Channing McClaren already knows
about the leak, so I can't stop

40:49.363 --> 40:52.631
it, but I'm offering you the chance
to get ahead of the tsunami.

40:52.666 --> 40:55.066
I can delay the leak long enough
for you to build a firewall,

40:55.102 --> 40:57.669
distance yourself
from the trading.

40:57.704 --> 41:01.273
HERRESHOFF: And in
exchange, you want...?

41:01.308 --> 41:05.443
SIMON: I want to get rid
of Channing McClaren.

41:12.285 --> 41:18.423
Once he's gone, I want funding
to keep the organization afloat.

41:18.458 --> 41:23.762
HERRESHOFF: How do you
intend to get rid of him?

41:23.797 --> 41:26.865
SIMON: By including the identity
of the source in the leak.

41:26.900 --> 41:31.903
Channing's entire persona is built
upon the promise of absolute anonymity

41:31.938 --> 41:33.038
for the whistle-blower.

41:33.073 --> 41:36.875
If he violates that,
he'll be ruined.

41:36.910 --> 41:41.346
HERRESHOFF: May I ask
the source's name?

41:41.381 --> 41:44.082
SIMON: Naomi Walling.

42:09.775 --> 42:11.810
(sighs)

43:01.494 --> 43:04.195
(horn honking in distance)

43:10.870 --> 43:13.104
(pigeon cooing)

43:44.904 --> 43:46.938
(wings flapping)

43:55.314 --> 43:57.348
(door bangs open)

44:03.322 --> 44:05.657
PARSONS: Thanks
for the heads-up.

44:05.692 --> 44:07.325
COOPER: You okay?

44:07.360 --> 44:09.461
PARSONS: I'm fine.

44:13.165 --> 44:16.868
PATRICK: What do
you want from me?

44:16.903 --> 44:20.605
PARSONS: I know who
you are, Mr. Scully.

44:20.640 --> 44:22.941
And apparently, you
know who I am.

44:22.976 --> 44:27.245
PATRICK: Never seen you
before in my life.

44:27.280 --> 44:29.881
PARSONS: Strange.

44:29.916 --> 44:36.821
Seeing as you tried to kill me when I
was staying in Patty Hewes' apartment.

44:36.857 --> 44:39.090
Why did you do it?

44:39.125 --> 44:42.594
PATRICK: Look... I ended up
with a knife in my chest.

44:42.629 --> 44:45.563
I'd say we're even.

44:45.599 --> 44:47.632
PARSONS: We're not even.

44:47.667 --> 44:51.369
PATRICK: You want to
hurt me, go ahead.

44:51.404 --> 44:54.105
Put one in the back
of my fucking head.

44:54.140 --> 44:55.340
Just do it already.

44:55.375 --> 44:58.109
PARSONS: That wouldn't
make us even, either.

44:58.144 --> 45:00.545
PATRICK: Well, then
what do you want?

45:00.580 --> 45:03.781
PARSONS: I want to
know who hired you.

45:14.727 --> 45:16.928
You see this?

45:19.331 --> 45:23.067
I had it on me that day.

45:23.103 --> 45:26.771
You see that corner
that's missing?

45:26.806 --> 45:30.108
I had the blood on that tested.

45:30.143 --> 45:32.243
And guess what?

45:32.279 --> 45:34.612
It's your DNA.

45:38.484 --> 45:45.757
I know you started a new life, Mr. Scully,
and you have a wife, a kid...

45:45.792 --> 45:52.130
but if you don't tell me what I
want to know, then it's all over.

45:52.165 --> 45:56.267
You'll never see them again.

45:56.303 --> 46:01.139
I have two homicide detectives
just waiting for my call.

46:09.081 --> 46:12.850
So let me ask you again.

46:12.886 --> 46:15.119
Who hired you?

46:22.094 --> 46:24.996
PATRICK: Patty Hewes.

46:25.031 --> 46:27.231
(footsteps approaching)

46:32.838 --> 46:35.306
MAGGIE: Ms. Hewes will
be with you in moment.

46:35.342 --> 46:37.375
PARSONS: Thank you.

47:06.772 --> 47:09.807
(indistinct voices in distance)

47:43.876 --> 47:47.612
PARSONS: I like your chair.

47:47.647 --> 47:50.014
Thought I'd give it a try.

47:50.050 --> 47:52.016
I need a new one for my office.

47:52.052 --> 47:54.252
HEWES: No, no, no, don't get up.

47:54.287 --> 47:55.753
Sit.

47:55.789 --> 47:58.089
See how it feels.

48:04.530 --> 48:08.466
I wasn't aware that we had
any outstanding business.

48:08.501 --> 48:11.202
PARSONS: We don't.

48:11.237 --> 48:14.439
I didn't think I'd see you
before the trial started, and...

48:14.474 --> 48:17.175
I wanted to wish you luck.

48:17.210 --> 48:19.577
HEWES: Well... (sniffs)

48:21.880 --> 48:24.182
Good luck to you.

48:27.686 --> 48:32.523
PARSONS: It's what
we wanted, isn't it?

48:32.559 --> 48:36.194
A fair fight.

48:36.229 --> 48:39.230
Head to head in a courtroom.

48:41.400 --> 48:43.835
HEWES: Absolutely.

48:50.242 --> 48:53.444
You know, I'm actually glad
you came by because there's

48:53.480 --> 48:57.415
something I wanted to
talk to you about.

48:57.450 --> 48:59.217
PARSONS: What's that?

48:59.252 --> 49:02.987
HEWES: Our conversation
in the airport in Maine.

49:11.330 --> 49:13.831
PARSONS: What about it?

49:16.935 --> 49:22.373
HEWES: Well, as I told you then...
I didn't have anything

49:22.408 --> 49:26.511
to do with your attack.

49:26.546 --> 49:34.118
But... PARSONS: But?

49:34.154 --> 49:38.234
HEWES: But I can understand
why you thought I did.

49:39.692 --> 49:43.614
And I want to apologize
if I was insensitive.

49:46.740 --> 49:48.398
I was just...

49:48.993 --> 49:50.373
surprised...

49:51.468 --> 49:53.518
that you still thought I'd been involved.

49:57.910 --> 50:01.579
PARSONS: I should be
apologizing to you.

50:03.982 --> 50:05.817
I feel stupid.

50:05.852 --> 50:10.621
'Course you had nothing
to do with it.

50:10.657 --> 50:13.090
And I'm sorry.

50:32.344 --> 50:36.681
HEWES: Ah, I just
had a premonition.

50:36.716 --> 50:38.616
PARSONS: Of what?

50:38.651 --> 50:43.421
HEWES: This is the last time you'll
ever set foot in this office.

50:49.695 --> 50:51.729
PARSONS: Maybe.

50:56.335 --> 50:58.736
You never know.

50:58.771 --> 51:01.806
(siren wailing in distance)
