WEBVTT

00:03.169 --> 00:07.340
Item five: in its wisdom,
Division has decreed

00:07.424 --> 00:10.802
citywide prostitution sweeps.

00:10.885 --> 00:13.972
This, of course, ignores
that practically everybody,

00:14.055 --> 00:17.809
including the johns,
is zeroed-out in disposable income,

00:17.892 --> 00:19.936
not to mention that it's 23 degrees.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.730
RENKO: Well, you know why that is, Sarge?

00:21.813 --> 00:24.566
Last July, someone downtown
decided to make this sweep,

00:24.649 --> 00:27.318
and it took Division this long
to figure out a plan on how to do it.

00:27.402 --> 00:29.446
Yeah, yeah. You're probably right, Andy.

00:29.529 --> 00:33.199
But that don't change the fact
that target blocks for this precinct

00:33.283 --> 00:36.745
are Van Buren between 137 and 140.

00:36.828 --> 00:38.621
Lieutenant Hunter is coordinating.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.373
Six: transfers.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.959
People, I'm gonna ask
each of you new arrivals

00:43.043 --> 00:45.462
to raise your hand
when I, uh, call out your name.

00:45.545 --> 00:48.882
Officer Jack Steger from Polk Avenue.

00:48.965 --> 00:50.717
-He's, uh...
-Yeah.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.386
He's an old compadre
of mine from back there.

00:53.470 --> 00:58.266
Officers Danielle Wiley, Ron Garfield,

00:58.975 --> 01:02.145
and, um, and James Trapido.

01:02.228 --> 01:04.189
Let me know if I'm mispronouncing anybody.

01:04.272 --> 01:07.484
-Tra-pee-do.
-Tra-pee-do. Right. You got it.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.319
Welcome. Bundle up.

01:09.402 --> 01:12.489
Item seven: ongoings and undercovers.

01:12.572 --> 01:16.117
Hendry and Bonzell
are at Barry's Electronic Emporium,

01:16.201 --> 01:19.037
and Mick Belker continues
preliminary investigation

01:19.120 --> 01:20.955
into a PCP undercover.

01:21.039 --> 01:21.956
Item eight.

01:22.582 --> 01:24.959
Now, the ball's back in our court, people.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.295
The city exterminators

01:27.378 --> 01:30.924
say that any further comprehensive
fumigation of these premises

01:31.007 --> 01:34.886
could possibly result
in making some of us humans sick.

01:34.969 --> 01:37.138
So to combat these roaches,

01:37.222 --> 01:40.058
they suggest that we take
prophylactic measures.

01:40.141 --> 01:43.228
-All right!
-Hey! Gutter minds!

01:43.311 --> 01:46.773
We've got to keep foodstuffs
out of unauthorized areas.

01:46.856 --> 01:49.818
-(indistinct chatter)
-Last item.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.278
It's a very happy one, too.

01:52.904 --> 01:55.990
Six o'clock tonight at the Kubiak Lodge,

01:56.074 --> 01:58.618
Mick Belker embarks
on the sea of matrimony

01:58.701 --> 02:02.372
with his longtime sweetheart,
Robin Tataglia.

02:02.455 --> 02:03.498
(cheers and applause)

02:03.581 --> 02:05.375
All right, Mick! Yeah! Yeah!

02:08.378 --> 02:11.714
-Hey, Mick, you a little nervous or what?
-Belker was nervous

02:11.798 --> 02:14.008
-because he had to take a shower.
-He looks nice.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.386
(laughter)

02:18.054 --> 02:20.765
The ceremony is gonna be at 6:00 sharp.

02:20.849 --> 02:23.768
The Kubiak is graciously
providing the reception.

02:24.727 --> 02:27.730
Okay, that's it. Let's have a safe shift.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.899
Let's get going.
They're getting away out there.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.735
-Good luck, Detective.
-Mick, congratulations.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.737
-Thanks, Bob.
-Hey.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.948
Hey, Mick, hang in there, baby.

02:37.031 --> 02:38.032
Thank you, Neal.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.953
Hey, uh, sandwich
is getting cold and greasy, J.D.

02:42.036 --> 02:43.705
Andy's not gonna eat it, man.

02:43.788 --> 02:46.666
Renko is a total pig, man.
He'll eat anything.

02:49.377 --> 02:50.545
BOBBY: Renko, let's go.

02:52.797 --> 02:55.091
-(groans)
-(sighs) We're both wrong.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.802
He's waiting for it
to get colder and greasier.

02:57.886 --> 02:59.220
(laughs)

03:00.180 --> 03:02.015
(telephone ringing)

03:02.098 --> 03:04.225
(indistinct conversations)

03:05.351 --> 03:08.855
So, uh, Mick, I figure you can
give me the ring at the Kubiak, huh?

03:08.938 --> 03:10.690
-Fine.
-Or you can give it to me now.

03:10.773 --> 03:13.276
-I'll give them to you at the Kubiak.
-Fine.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.278
I'm a little nervous.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.989
I haven't been a best man for 25 years.

03:18.072 --> 03:19.782
I never been married ever.

03:21.618 --> 03:22.744
Hey, Detective.

03:22.827 --> 03:24.996
Hey, Ron Garfield, my man.

03:25.079 --> 03:27.207
-How you doing?
-Good. Good to be back up here.

03:27.290 --> 03:30.251
Hey, look, what are people putting in
for Detective Belker's present?

03:30.335 --> 03:31.544
Hey, we got it covered, Ron.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.713
-Appreciate the thought, though.
-(harrumphs)

03:33.796 --> 03:34.631
All right.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.968
J.D., when are you picking up
Belker's wedding gift?

03:39.052 --> 03:41.137
-Now.
-What's it look like?

03:41.221 --> 03:43.306
-Like a refrigerator.
-I don't know.

03:43.389 --> 03:46.059
J.D., do you think a refrigerator
was a good wedding present?

03:46.142 --> 03:48.269
-I've been thinking about it.
-Coffey, I'll tell you what.

03:48.353 --> 03:50.396
If you think you can find
a better present, next time,

03:50.480 --> 03:52.190
you be the head
of the gift committee, okay?

03:52.273 --> 03:53.942
-I asked you a simple question.
-Yeah.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.277
Hey, the man's not eating.
Let's go get Mick's gift.

03:56.361 --> 03:57.278
Wait.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.035
Aah! Aah! Aah!

04:04.118 --> 04:05.703
-What happened?
-What's up, man?

04:05.787 --> 04:09.040
In my Mr. Muffin,
there's a giant cockroach!

04:09.123 --> 04:11.084
-You didn't eat it, did you?
-I don't know!

04:11.167 --> 04:12.710
Let me see it. Now, wait a minute.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.337
Ah, he's right.

04:15.630 --> 04:18.299
Hey, look at these cute,
little feelers, huh?

04:18.383 --> 04:20.510
(voice shaking) I didn't eat
any of it, did I?

04:20.593 --> 04:23.680
Renko, your problem is
you're totally wussified.

04:23.763 --> 04:26.015
Now, <i>roaches</i> taste great.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.976
You are out of your mind!

04:28.059 --> 04:29.686
They're a great source of protein.

04:29.769 --> 04:32.397
(exclaims) Robert, I can understand biting

04:32.480 --> 04:35.275
into a bug for breakfast once,
but twice in one day?

04:35.358 --> 04:37.443
Wait a minute, Renko,
what do you mean, two times?

04:37.527 --> 04:41.614
Well, when I was downstairs,
I found a bug in this one, too.

04:41.698 --> 04:42.532
What?

04:42.615 --> 04:43.950
-Right here.
-Let me see that.

04:44.033 --> 04:46.869
Only that one looked like
it was made out of candy.

04:46.953 --> 04:50.081
Uh-oh, lover. (laughs)

04:50.164 --> 04:52.000
(laughs)

04:52.083 --> 04:54.252
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:54.335 --> 04:56.546
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

04:56.629 --> 05:00.550
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:07.724 --> 05:11.144
(theme music playing)

06:51.994 --> 06:53.329
MICK: Robin?

06:53.413 --> 06:54.580
(coughs)

06:55.373 --> 06:58.251
-Looks like she beat the rush.
-MICK: Is it possible to pick up my tux?

06:59.085 --> 07:01.587
-Come here. Don't you get it?
-MICK: It's over on Rosenberg.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.714
We're going out on a sweep,
and she already got busted.

07:03.798 --> 07:05.800
-MICK: No, I can't go right now.
-That's a joke.

07:05.883 --> 07:08.261
-Jokey-jokey. Come on.
-MICK: No, I got some stuff to do.

07:08.344 --> 07:11.389
-You sure you can pick it up, Robin?
-FURILLO: Yes, okay, I can wait.

07:11.472 --> 07:13.641
-Yeah, because if you get the tux--
-FURILLO: Mick.

07:14.725 --> 07:16.894
I can go straight home, get changed,

07:16.978 --> 07:18.729
and meet you over at the Kubiak.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.899
Yeah. You sure you're up to it?
You're feeling okay?

07:23.401 --> 07:24.485
All right.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.320
Okay. I take it back.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.030
I'll see you later.

07:29.031 --> 07:30.700
I love you. Bye-bye.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.996
FRANK: If Special Narcotics
wanted in on Belker's operation,

07:35.079 --> 07:36.998
it had three weeks to say so.

07:37.748 --> 07:39.000
Cooker. Correct.

07:39.542 --> 07:42.920
No, he's cooking for the other two guys.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.840
The guys who stepped out
on our informant's organization

07:45.923 --> 07:48.468
and ordered it manufactured for Suarez.

07:49.760 --> 07:50.845
Correct.

07:50.928 --> 07:53.181
Suarez's organization
is the ultimate target.

07:53.681 --> 07:56.267
I know he's the biggest up here.
That's why we're after him.

07:57.226 --> 07:59.979
Uh, no. Detective Belker
has already left for the day.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.732
-Mm-hm.
-Thank you.

08:02.815 --> 08:06.110
(exhales) Is there any way
we can help you logistically today?

08:06.194 --> 08:09.113
No, I don't think so.
My informant's just doing intros.

08:09.197 --> 08:12.450
-No, I mean the wedding.
-(laughing) Oh. No, thanks, Captain.

08:12.533 --> 08:14.202
We've got everything
pretty much under control.

08:14.285 --> 08:15.703
-Good. I'll see you later.
-Okay.

08:15.786 --> 08:17.788
I want to introduce you to the captain.

08:17.872 --> 08:21.083
Captain, this is Officer Jack Steger.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.544
-Jack just transferred up.
-Jack.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.755
-Officer Garfield you remember.
-Ronnie.

08:25.838 --> 08:27.673
It's good to be working
with you again, sir.

08:27.757 --> 08:29.634
Jack and I did time at the Polk.

08:29.717 --> 08:32.678
Back when we both had hair
and one stomach apiece. (laughs)

08:32.762 --> 08:34.847
I thought I'd team jack up
with Officer Garfield,

08:34.931 --> 08:36.557
at least for the first couple of days.

08:36.641 --> 08:38.601
Ron can chase them down,
and I'll cuff them.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.895
-Sounds good. Welcome.
-All right.

08:41.646 --> 08:44.524
Well, come on, kid. Let's go chase girls.

08:44.607 --> 08:45.816
Good luck.

09:03.834 --> 09:06.921
-Joe, we don't have the time.
-The sweep can wait for five minutes.

09:07.004 --> 09:08.631
Now, tell me, what is it?

09:08.714 --> 09:10.383
Is it the ceramics guy?

09:10.466 --> 09:11.676
Sort of.

09:12.635 --> 09:13.803
Did you sleep with him?

09:15.638 --> 09:16.764
I made a mistake.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.518
I told you the guy was a jerk.
I knew he was a jerk.

09:20.601 --> 09:22.311
Hey, you take shots in life.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.021
Some of them work, and some don't.

09:24.105 --> 09:25.147
That's right.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.192
When I was younger
I used to think, you know,

09:28.276 --> 09:31.571
"Someday you are gonna have
somebody who loves you

09:31.654 --> 09:34.323
-and a family."
-And someday you're gonna have

09:34.407 --> 09:35.992
-all those things.
-No, I'm not.

09:36.075 --> 09:38.911
This is the way my life is gonna be,
and I gotta face that.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.830
And sometimes that's hard to do.

09:43.291 --> 09:44.458
Come on. Let's go.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.337
-You still got me.
-Let's go. Let's go.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.508
Let's hear it one more time now.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.677
What's the main chemical
you got to watch out for?

09:54.760 --> 09:55.636
Ether.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.347
Right, because the ether
can blow you up, dig?

09:58.431 --> 10:01.475
Now, what's your next main problem,
considering you're a policeman?

10:02.602 --> 10:04.520
-What?
-(groans)

10:06.230 --> 10:07.315
The juice, man.

10:07.398 --> 10:09.734
Don't get none of the juice
on your hands or up your nose,

10:09.817 --> 10:11.736
because you get high, your cover is gone.

10:11.819 --> 10:13.070
Juice makes a man want to talk.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.531
I wear gloves. I don't breathe the fumes.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.452
Another name for the PCP?

10:20.453 --> 10:23.789
Uh, dust, angel dust, crack,

10:23.873 --> 10:26.917
cloud walk, uh...

10:27.001 --> 10:30.379
-Some of the names for the piperidine.
-Pipe. I know all this stuff.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.007
Well, you want to tell me what it's about?

10:33.090 --> 10:35.176
-Tell you about what?
-Dig, if I'm educating you,

10:35.259 --> 10:37.261
you're getting a whole course, understand?

10:37.803 --> 10:39.096
Now, the molecules, come on.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.057
Come on, man!
We talked about the molecules!

10:41.140 --> 10:42.725
I know what a molecule is.

10:42.808 --> 10:45.478
You get these molecules hooked
up, and that makes the compound.

10:45.561 --> 10:47.396
That's where the money is,
in the compound.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.524
That's what breaks the blood-brain
barriers and up you go, man!

10:50.608 --> 10:53.361
You know, you remind me
of my third-grade teacher.

10:55.863 --> 10:57.865
(snorts) Yeah, yeah.

10:57.948 --> 11:00.201
Well, a man teaches
what he knows, you know?

11:01.786 --> 11:03.663
Driver's ed teaches driving.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.165
Cop teaches how to police.

11:06.248 --> 11:07.833
I know PCP.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.045
Yo, Chato. Yeah, Johnson here.

11:11.712 --> 11:14.215
Well, I've been trying
to talk dollars, man, you know?

11:14.298 --> 11:16.300
All right. Did you get
the sample of the product?

11:17.843 --> 11:18.886
Right.

11:19.762 --> 11:20.971
Right.

11:21.055 --> 11:22.807
Yeah, Mick. Mick from Detroit, man.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.145
Be right over.

11:33.442 --> 11:34.610
They like the batch?

11:34.694 --> 11:36.570
Why wouldn't they like it, man?
I cooked it.

11:36.654 --> 11:39.031
Question is, when you cook it,
are they gonna like it?

11:46.372 --> 11:48.958
Those not engaged in illegal commerce

11:49.041 --> 11:50.751
will be allowed to leave.

11:50.835 --> 11:53.254
Now, please people, be patient.

11:53.337 --> 11:57.425
Stand by until you are checked
by one of our officers.

11:57.508 --> 11:58.509
Hold it, lady!

11:58.592 --> 12:02.096
If requested, you must show
proper identification.

12:02.179 --> 12:04.473
A green card, a passport, credit card...

12:04.557 --> 12:05.933
Come here!

12:06.016 --> 12:08.144
HUNTER: Someone stop that woman, please.

12:08.227 --> 12:10.980
(siren wailing)

12:11.063 --> 12:14.608
-(tires screech)
-MAN: You, right there, freeze!

12:19.530 --> 12:21.323
Officer, you're hurting me!

12:22.700 --> 12:23.951
MAN: Sir, lock your door.

12:24.034 --> 12:25.619
Lock your store door.

12:25.703 --> 12:28.789
(sirens wailing)

12:30.833 --> 12:31.917
Nickel bust.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.377
Where's that jerk going?

12:33.461 --> 12:35.212
Leon's got some warrants out.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.422
Let's get him.

12:37.047 --> 12:38.966
(jackhammer running)

12:42.094 --> 12:47.266
(siren wailing)

12:53.814 --> 12:56.233
(siren wailing)

13:03.324 --> 13:04.408
Down!

13:22.802 --> 13:24.053
Garfield!

13:24.678 --> 13:26.347
-You okay?
-He had a gun.

13:26.430 --> 13:28.349
He pointed a gun at me.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.113
It's not here.

13:44.573 --> 13:46.867
Look, I saw it.
It was in his hand. I saw it!

13:46.951 --> 13:48.786
Take it easy. Take it easy. We'll find it.

13:56.585 --> 13:57.920
Man, I know he had a gun.

13:58.003 --> 14:00.422
He pointed the gun at me,
and he was gonna shoot it!

14:00.506 --> 14:03.092
Just go back. Go back and call it in.

14:03.175 --> 14:04.385
I'll find the gun.

14:28.325 --> 14:31.120
Officer, somebody had better get
over to the alley.

14:31.203 --> 14:33.789
-There's been a shooting.
-Tell my partner. He's over there.

14:43.340 --> 14:47.553
2250. Officer-involved shooting.
Suspect down.

14:48.512 --> 14:51.473
137 Van Buren, in the alley.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.934
-DISPATCH: <i>Ten-four, 2250.</i>
-Requesting an ambulance.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.394
<i>Ten-four, we copy.</i>

14:58.939 --> 15:00.524
Hey, come with me!

15:15.581 --> 15:18.334
Hey, kid, I found it. Here it is.

15:38.187 --> 15:42.024
Sixty percent of your manpower
going to victimless-crime sweeps,

15:42.107 --> 15:44.026
forty percent left to cover the streets.

15:44.109 --> 15:47.655
Robert, the secret of effective
police administration

15:47.738 --> 15:50.366
is priorities, and Division has none!

15:51.700 --> 15:53.285
-What is so funny?
-(laughs)

15:53.369 --> 15:56.997
I was just thinking about LaRue's face
when you pulled that bug.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.332
(both laugh)

15:58.415 --> 16:00.250
We done him good, didn't we?

16:00.334 --> 16:02.419
(laughing) We had him flat on that thing.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.713
-He was.
-Here we are.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.632
Oh, no. Look at this, Renko.

16:06.715 --> 16:09.969
(sirens wailing)

16:10.886 --> 16:12.346
MAN: Guy over here is pretty bad.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.478
Let's go! Move out of the way!

16:21.230 --> 16:22.231
Hey!

16:43.419 --> 16:45.629
Just relax, mister.
Everything's gonna be okay.

16:45.713 --> 16:48.048
-The heart. Check the heart.
-Your heart is okay.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.217
No, the heart in the chest, man.

16:50.300 --> 16:53.137
-I just said your heart is perfect.
-No! The heart in the back!

16:53.220 --> 16:54.972
Uh, sir, I think you're going into shock.

16:55.055 --> 16:57.683
Listen! The heart, the transplant.

16:57.766 --> 17:00.477
-It's in a red-and-white cooler.
-There's no cooler back here.

17:00.561 --> 17:03.147
A red-and-white cooler?
The guy I was chasing had one.

17:03.230 --> 17:05.441
(groans) That's it. They stole the heart!

17:05.524 --> 17:07.026
-Stole a heart?
-Call for backups.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.360
We're checking the alleys.

17:11.363 --> 17:12.990
(engine racing)

17:13.073 --> 17:14.658
(tires squealing)

17:17.036 --> 17:19.705
(siren wailing)

17:35.971 --> 17:37.389
These dudes are over their heads.

17:37.473 --> 17:40.934
-They may show short with the front money.
-That's all right. I'll let them owe me.

17:41.018 --> 17:43.395
They're way into these
Dominicans, though, man.

17:43.479 --> 17:45.856
One guy, Filo,
he's married to Suarez's sister.

17:45.939 --> 17:49.443
-That's the guy coming down the stairs?
-No, that's Chato. Filo's behind him.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.029
What's happening, guys?

17:52.946 --> 17:53.906
What you got, Willie?

17:53.989 --> 17:55.824
I want you to meet my man Mick,
from Detroit.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.868
-Second best chemist in America.
-How are you?

17:57.951 --> 17:59.578
What do you say, Mick? How you feeling?

17:59.661 --> 18:02.539
Well, I'm gonna feel great
when I see $5,000 front money.

18:02.623 --> 18:06.001
Hey, Mick, that sample
you made went over great!

18:06.085 --> 18:08.545
Vato we gave it to thinks
he was in outer space.

18:08.629 --> 18:10.589
That's $5,000 for the chemist, fellas.

18:10.672 --> 18:12.341
Here's our scene with that, Mick.

18:12.424 --> 18:13.967
We got to run that down for you.

18:14.051 --> 18:15.803
They're gonna run down their scene for me?

18:15.886 --> 18:17.763
Hey, look, don't embarrass me,
huh, fellas?

18:17.846 --> 18:20.432
-Where's the man's money?
-Don't be getting down on Willie here.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.351
They said they had their thing together.
Go ahead.

18:22.434 --> 18:25.938
Square business, Mick.
We put our money all in product.

18:26.021 --> 18:28.398
We spent the money buying
the piperidine, man.

18:28.482 --> 18:29.983
We're just light on our front to you.

18:30.067 --> 18:32.361
In other words, you want me
to mix up a batch on credit

18:32.444 --> 18:34.822
-so you can impress your new connections.
-Listen,

18:34.905 --> 18:37.825
how about instead of $180,
you got $400 a pint?

18:37.908 --> 18:41.245
Hey, guys, we're moving to can
all the weight you can mix.

18:41.328 --> 18:44.957
Mick, they can move 20 pints a week.

18:45.749 --> 18:50.337
Twenty times 100,
looking at $8,000 a week.

18:50.420 --> 18:53.132
-What do you think, Willie?
-I'm not telling you what to do, man.

18:53.215 --> 18:56.385
Look, people embarrass me
if they don't give me the straight story.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.887
We got state-of-the-art
equipment in here, man.

18:58.971 --> 19:02.349
What state-of-the-art?
You need a garbage can and ether.

19:02.432 --> 19:04.643
Boys, don't insult my intelligence.

19:04.726 --> 19:06.311
Sorry, sorry.

19:06.395 --> 19:10.232
Forget it. I'm here.
I already made the trip.

19:10.315 --> 19:12.734
That's solid, Mick.
You ain't gonna regret this, man.

19:12.818 --> 19:16.113
Come on inside, and you just
show us how you want it set up.

19:19.449 --> 19:21.076
When do I meet your friends?

19:21.160 --> 19:22.870
The Dominicans? Later.

19:23.495 --> 19:26.206
Hey, you're gonna like those cats.
They're serious how you are.

19:27.082 --> 19:29.793
So I hear this guy's going bankrupt
and I figure, "What the heck?"

19:29.877 --> 19:31.545
Place is right next door to my car lot.

19:31.628 --> 19:33.839
So presto, Rob's Discount Kingdom.

19:33.922 --> 19:35.924
You're not giving yourself
enough credit, Rob.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.427
Looks like you put
at least 30 bucks into fixtures.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.180
Neal, what do you think?

19:41.263 --> 19:43.307
One day I think the crown
just looks great,

19:43.390 --> 19:45.184
and then, the day after...

19:45.267 --> 19:46.977
I think it's maybe over the top.

19:47.811 --> 19:49.271
I think the day after, Rob.

19:49.354 --> 19:52.274
Uh, what about the fridge, Rob?
You remember Belker's refrigerator?

19:52.357 --> 19:54.610
Brother-in-law, would you be averse

19:54.693 --> 19:56.820
to me saving you a few bucks
on this present?

19:56.904 --> 19:58.447
Save it how?

19:58.530 --> 20:02.159
Merely by removing the tag
of a nationally advertised product,

20:02.242 --> 20:04.912
which we all know advertising
drives up the prices, anyway,

20:04.995 --> 20:08.373
and placing it on
this brother fridge from Mexico,

20:08.457 --> 20:11.210
thereby making the Chill King a G.E.

20:11.293 --> 20:14.171
Is that right? Why would you
want to do a thing like that?

20:14.254 --> 20:16.215
Look, I give it to you
for a yard and a half less,

20:16.298 --> 20:17.758
and we both make out.

20:17.841 --> 20:19.509
So America's never heard of Chill King?

20:19.593 --> 20:21.094
Don't mean it doesn't freeze
hamburg, right?

20:21.178 --> 20:23.138
Must've paid top dollar
for them, huh, Rob?

20:23.222 --> 20:26.099
Well, I took advantage
of the fluctuating Mexican peso.

20:26.183 --> 20:27.768
What kind of a warranty we get?

20:27.851 --> 20:29.853
It breaks, you apologize? Uh-uh.

20:29.937 --> 20:32.564
I ain't laying a clunker
on Detective Belker on his wedding day

20:32.648 --> 20:34.524
so me and Neal can pocket
a couple of bucks.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.693
Oh, J.D., when did you
become such a saint?

20:36.777 --> 20:38.070
It's not a matter of that.

20:38.153 --> 20:41.156
It so happens my fellow officers
elected me head of the gift committee.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.575
Well, I guess I just can't
give you the fan, can I?

20:43.659 --> 20:45.619
Hey, now, that fan was no kickback.

20:45.702 --> 20:48.288
That fan happens to be
an incentive finder's bonus.

20:48.372 --> 20:51.833
I want the G.E., and I want it
delivered to the Kubiak by 4:30.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.002
Sure. Whatever you say, J.D.
Whatever you say.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.797
It's getting harder and harder every year
to tell your sister Peg

20:56.880 --> 20:58.298
what a jerk her brother is.

20:58.382 --> 21:01.760
Hey, J.D. we got to
get back to the precinct, babe.

21:01.843 --> 21:03.262
Something about a missing heart.

21:03.345 --> 21:06.390
That's not fatal.
Rob's lived with that for years.

21:08.725 --> 21:10.978
Stan, let's bring four more
teams for the heart search

21:11.061 --> 21:14.231
-as soon as they've logged their hookers.
-Captain, the doctors are saying

21:14.314 --> 21:16.441
there's only a four-hour
viability on this heart.

21:16.525 --> 21:19.069
That's correct.
We're on a tight clock. Excuse me.

21:19.152 --> 21:22.072
Ladies and gentlemen, please,

21:22.155 --> 21:25.867
would print media please take
a back seat for the moment?

21:25.951 --> 21:28.787
Radio and television reporters
can get this story out much faster.

21:28.870 --> 21:30.956
Lady, I know you feel terrible.
I feel bad, too.

21:31.039 --> 21:33.125
But that ain't
what these phone lines are for.

21:33.208 --> 21:35.335
Again, Captain.
Start from the appeal part.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.754
We're appealing to whoever
possesses the heart,

21:37.838 --> 21:39.673
however he or she came to have it.

21:39.756 --> 21:41.758
This is a no-questions-asked situation.

21:41.842 --> 21:43.343
Hill street. Buntz.

21:43.427 --> 21:46.763
You may not even know you have it.
It's ice-packed in a red-and-white cooler.

21:46.847 --> 21:48.724
Um? I'd like to repeat the numbers.

21:48.807 --> 21:52.185
We've added trace capability
on your 57, 58, 59.

21:52.269 --> 21:55.605
-Right.
-554, 55, and 56.

21:55.689 --> 21:56.732
Captain.

21:57.441 --> 22:02.112
Um, also, we think,
uh, maybe the perpetrator,

22:02.195 --> 22:04.990
uh, discarded the cooler.

22:05.073 --> 22:07.034
You feel terrible, too, huh?

22:07.117 --> 22:08.785
Capital punishment, huh?

22:08.869 --> 22:11.413
Listen, write your congressman,
all right, lady?

22:11.496 --> 22:13.332
The Van Buren subway line,
please be alert.

22:13.415 --> 22:15.917
Captain, would you tell people
we don't want condolences?

22:16.001 --> 22:17.461
We want information.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.717
What time does IAD get here?

22:24.968 --> 22:26.261
They say at 11:30.

22:27.262 --> 22:29.097
Don't you worry about those guys.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.807
I mean, it was a clean shoot.

22:32.642 --> 22:35.771
"He turned, I saw the gun, I fired."

22:36.605 --> 22:37.647
Case closed.

22:39.691 --> 22:42.402
I'm just thinking about what
I'd be feeling like now, boy.

22:43.695 --> 22:45.364
If you hadn't found that guy's piece...

22:45.447 --> 22:46.823
Well, you overlooked it.

22:49.659 --> 22:51.244
You were too busy shaking, right?

22:51.328 --> 22:53.080
(laughs)

22:53.163 --> 22:54.664
You ever used your gun, Jack?

22:54.748 --> 22:56.083
Five times, my friend.

22:57.042 --> 22:58.794
One thing you don't want is doubts.

23:00.420 --> 23:02.047
Doubts will kill you next time.

23:03.548 --> 23:07.636
At the alley facing Van Buren Street
between 138 and 139,

23:07.719 --> 23:10.138
the suspect turned
and confronted me with a weapon.

23:11.890 --> 23:15.268
-I felt myself at risk, and I fired.
-Did your partner see the exchange?

23:15.352 --> 23:17.938
No. He reached the alley
about 20 seconds later.

23:18.021 --> 23:19.773
Suspect hadn't fired his weapon.

23:19.856 --> 23:22.484
-No, he was just about to.
-You concluded that?

23:22.567 --> 23:24.611
He'd pulled his piece
and was bringing it to bear.

23:24.694 --> 23:26.905
I concluded that he was about to fire.

23:28.949 --> 23:31.493
(sighs) We'll be taking
your partner's statement.

23:31.576 --> 23:32.786
Officer Steger.

23:32.869 --> 23:36.206
We'll be taking officer Steger's statement
and examining SID findings.

23:36.289 --> 23:38.166
You'll work from your desk until notified.

23:40.544 --> 23:42.379
Is there a problem with the shoot, sir?

23:43.088 --> 23:45.298
If there is, we'll be asking
for a further statement.

23:51.721 --> 23:53.723
I don't see any problem, officer.

23:58.979 --> 24:01.773
So Robin and Mick open
the freezer compartment.

24:01.857 --> 24:04.192
They can't believe it,
but there it is in front of them.

24:04.276 --> 24:06.736
-Frozen money.
-Now, what do you think? 400 singles?

24:06.820 --> 24:08.238
Impressive in terms of bulk.

24:08.321 --> 24:13.535
Or the simple, understated eloquence
of four clean Franklins?

24:13.618 --> 24:16.496
Guys, we can use you manning
the phones on this missing heart search.

24:16.580 --> 24:19.499
These people, they call up.
They think it's <i>Phil Donahue, </i>you know?

24:19.583 --> 24:21.751
"What a terrible shame.
What an awful crime.

24:21.835 --> 24:24.629
"I saw people carrying a cooler,
but they were on a picnic.

24:24.713 --> 24:27.257
-I could see the freaking ham sandwiches."
-Hey.

24:28.633 --> 24:31.303
Joe, Luce, um, get your girls 713'ed

24:31.386 --> 24:33.388
and then get out
on this search for the heart.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.140
-All right.
-Joe, Joe!

24:35.223 --> 24:37.642
That's Mrs. Dewitt, Fabian's mom.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.520
JOE: I'll take care of the girls, Luce.

24:41.605 --> 24:42.814
This way ladies.

24:48.695 --> 24:49.779
(door closes)

24:51.531 --> 24:52.991
You even know who I am?

24:53.074 --> 24:54.367
Sure, I remember you.

24:55.202 --> 24:56.495
Your name is Lucy.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.455
Where's Fabian? Is he with you?

24:59.581 --> 25:01.958
Fabian's in North Carolina with his aunt.

25:02.751 --> 25:04.503
Just where I left him.

25:04.586 --> 25:07.005
Where you sent him the Christmas present.

25:07.088 --> 25:09.007
Didn't you send him the Christmas present?

25:09.090 --> 25:10.967
I thought you were
staying down there, Mrs. Dewitt.

25:11.051 --> 25:13.970
-I thought things were going better.
-Fabian's fine now.

25:14.596 --> 25:15.931
He's fine with his aunt.

25:16.014 --> 25:17.724
You should be ashamed of yourself.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.144
You get a gift from God,
and you throw your life in the sewer.

25:21.228 --> 25:23.855
-It's my life.
-And what about his life?

25:23.939 --> 25:26.149
What are you doing to your son?
You know, he loves you.

25:26.233 --> 25:27.859
-You shut up!
-I don't have to shut up--

25:27.943 --> 25:30.070
Sergeant, I request you refrain

25:30.153 --> 25:32.489
from speaking with my client
without counsel present.

25:32.572 --> 25:35.659
That's real great. Everybody's
concerned about Vivian Dewitt's rights

25:35.742 --> 25:37.702
while she cuts her son off
from everything he deserves.

25:37.786 --> 25:39.704
-Get out of here!
-Sergeant.

25:40.789 --> 25:42.040
I'm leaving.

25:42.123 --> 25:43.917
Junkie hooker makes me sick anyway.

25:46.294 --> 25:48.255
Here. Here's a stack of them.

25:48.338 --> 25:50.674
These all can't be
legitimate calls, Sarge.

25:50.757 --> 25:52.676
Heart will be dead
by the time we answer these.

25:52.759 --> 25:55.387
Hospital called.
Heart's viable another hour and a half.

25:57.931 --> 25:59.349
Give me a couple of them, Stan.

26:00.100 --> 26:02.477
Anybody else? Anybody else?

26:02.561 --> 26:04.271
We got 90 minutes, folks.

26:04.354 --> 26:05.438
Give me a bunch.

26:09.985 --> 26:12.487
-Let's go.
-What happened with Fabian's mother?

26:12.571 --> 26:14.406
Let's go, we got this now. Let's go.

26:17.117 --> 26:19.160
-Frank, your office.
-What's up?

26:19.244 --> 26:22.330
Interesting find on follow-up
at Garfield's shoot.

26:22.414 --> 26:26.960
No, ma'am, I don't know
what a human heart looks like exactly.

26:27.961 --> 26:30.046
No, not like a piece of liver, ma'am.

26:30.130 --> 26:33.425
I gotta say, J.D.,
money as a gift seems a little cold.

26:33.508 --> 26:35.468
Of course it's cold. It's in a fridge.

26:35.552 --> 26:37.721
Okay, now who you gonna put on?

26:38.930 --> 26:40.223
You know what I'm saying, J.D.

26:40.307 --> 26:42.017
What about getting them
some more presents and stuff?

26:42.100 --> 26:43.893
What presents? Thank you, ma'am.

26:43.977 --> 26:45.812
Presents like you buy.

26:45.895 --> 26:48.064
Fill up the fridge with them.
Make it more festive.

26:48.148 --> 26:49.899
When are we gonna have time
to buy presents

26:49.983 --> 26:52.235
if we got 3,000 stupid
phone calls to answer?

26:52.319 --> 26:55.155
-Yeah, heart's gonna be dead soon.
-Speaking of cold--

26:55.238 --> 26:57.073
I mean, even if it's like
a basket of fruit.

26:57.157 --> 26:59.242
-Or like steaks, you mean?
-Sure.

26:59.326 --> 27:01.995
Hockey tickets. Big flashlight. Small dog.

27:02.078 --> 27:04.247
-(telephone rings)
-Yeah?

27:04.331 --> 27:07.417
I took the gun to forensics myself.
The pimp's prints are all over it.

27:07.500 --> 27:09.669
Have we checked what Garfield's
partner has to say?

27:09.753 --> 27:12.505
Steger. I think he's
following up heart leads.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.594
Ron, could you step in here
a minute, please?

27:26.936 --> 27:28.021
Rough way to start.

27:29.272 --> 27:30.106
Yes, sir.

27:30.190 --> 27:32.609
-IAD talk to you yet?
-Yes, they did.

27:33.401 --> 27:35.320
Ron, I understand a gun
was found this morning

27:35.403 --> 27:36.905
near the body of the man you shot

27:36.988 --> 27:39.282
and that gun has been
print-matched to the deceased.

27:39.366 --> 27:40.533
Yes, sir. That's correct.

27:41.326 --> 27:43.870
-You saw him pull how many guns?
-How many?

27:43.953 --> 27:46.831
One. It was enough, sir.

27:46.915 --> 27:48.875
-Just one.
-Well, a little while ago,

27:48.958 --> 27:51.378
Lieutenant Goldblume
found another gun at the scene,

27:51.461 --> 27:54.798
lying under a Dumpster
not too far from the body.

27:54.881 --> 27:57.884
And that second gun also has
the deceased's prints on it.

27:57.967 --> 27:58.927
What?

27:59.678 --> 28:00.887
Two guns were found.

28:01.596 --> 28:03.056
One possibility:

28:03.139 --> 28:05.266
you dropped the gun
that Officer Steger recovered

28:05.350 --> 28:07.727
because you couldn't find the pimp's gun
and we turned it up later.

28:07.811 --> 28:09.979
No way. I never even carry a backup piece.

28:10.063 --> 28:13.358
Ron, this is simply to let you
know the facts as uncovered.

28:13.942 --> 28:17.278
You may want to sit down quietly now
and write down everything you can remember

28:17.362 --> 28:19.155
-from the incident.
-I've already done that.

28:19.239 --> 28:20.949
Then do it again. Go over it.

28:21.783 --> 28:23.326
In part, what captain is saying

28:23.410 --> 28:25.328
is that this was your first shooting,
you might have been scared.

28:25.412 --> 28:28.623
Right now would be the best time to be
totally forthcoming about everything.

28:28.707 --> 28:31.292
Or he may have withdrawn a second gun,
but you didn't see it.

28:31.876 --> 28:33.503
There may be a number of explanations.

28:33.586 --> 28:36.589
There's an explanation for it,
but that's not it. That's not it.

28:38.883 --> 28:40.176
Am I excused, captain?

28:40.260 --> 28:44.222
You may want your PBA representative
for you next Internal Affairs interview.

28:44.973 --> 28:47.225
(indistinct conversations)

29:01.906 --> 29:04.033
DISPATCH: <i>Any units,</i>
<i>missing heart ransom demand</i>

29:04.117 --> 29:05.952
<i>-traced to pay phone 138...</i>
-(siren wails)

29:06.035 --> 29:07.996
When did that come in,
an hour and a half ago?

29:08.079 --> 29:11.082
-An hour ago?
-2202 rolling. It's now 10:20.

29:11.166 --> 29:13.334
142 and Van Meer.

29:13.418 --> 29:16.755
-Renko, they're going as fast as they can.
-2202 is going,

29:16.838 --> 29:19.174
but you know what we're gonna find out
when we get there?

29:19.257 --> 29:20.925
Another empty damn phone booth!

29:21.009 --> 29:22.969
You know why? Because they left!

29:23.052 --> 29:26.139
Because if it was a legitimate call,
they got tired of waiting!

29:26.222 --> 29:28.558
Well, we got to try.
It ain't over until it's over.

29:28.641 --> 29:30.935
How much time's that heart got left?
About 20 minutes?

29:31.019 --> 29:34.105
(sirens wailing)

29:40.904 --> 29:42.781
You see a man making
a phone call from there?

29:42.864 --> 29:44.741
Crazy old junkie. Lives over the deli.

29:44.824 --> 29:47.160
-He still around?
-Beats me. Hey, wait a minute.

29:47.243 --> 29:49.662
-There! That's him. Over there.
-RENKO: I'll get him.

29:49.746 --> 29:51.039
Hey!

29:51.122 --> 29:53.041
Come on through!

29:53.124 --> 29:56.169
-Officer!
-(horns honking)

29:57.921 --> 29:59.506
Come on! Come on through!

30:03.843 --> 30:07.013
(sirens wailing)

30:08.598 --> 30:10.517
(tires screeching)

30:12.310 --> 30:15.522
2202 in pursuit of suspect
with stolen heart.

30:15.605 --> 30:18.191
Northbound on Dekker and 139.

30:18.274 --> 30:20.443
He's traveling in a blue Plymouth.

30:20.527 --> 30:23.154
What kind of a person would steal a heart?

30:23.238 --> 30:25.156
He didn't know a heart was in it, Renko.

30:28.243 --> 30:30.829
DISPATCH:<i> Northbound on Dekker.</i>
<i>Any available units.</i>

30:51.808 --> 30:54.686
-Hold it right there!
-No closer, or the heart gets it!

30:54.769 --> 30:56.938
HILL: There's a man in desperate
need of that organ.

30:57.021 --> 30:58.857
If he doesn't get it, he's gonna die.

30:58.940 --> 31:00.692
-I want money. And drugs!
-Is this our man?

31:00.775 --> 31:02.944
-He's our man.
-Hey! Hey!

31:03.027 --> 31:06.114
I told them, "Mess with me,
and I'm gonna do the heart!"

31:06.197 --> 31:08.241
Dr. Hill, Dr. Renko.
Get your gowns and masks on.

31:08.324 --> 31:10.827
-We may have to operate.
-THIEF: What are you talking about?

31:10.910 --> 31:14.080
I'm the one that's gonna be operating.
Then you don't get no heart!

31:14.163 --> 31:16.249
That's where you're wrong, smart guy.

31:16.332 --> 31:19.043
Because if that heart don't make it,
I'm gonna blow your head off,

31:19.127 --> 31:20.670
and we'll use yours, you got that?

31:20.753 --> 31:22.964
Get that case out of my car.
I got a scalpel in there.

31:23.047 --> 31:25.633
This man's crazy! He can't do that!

31:25.717 --> 31:27.635
BUNTZ: No? You can count, can't you?

31:27.719 --> 31:29.554
'Cause I'm gonna count backwards from two.

31:29.637 --> 31:30.763
Wait one damn minute!

31:30.847 --> 31:33.349
Two! Get ready, when he goes
we're not gonna have much time

31:33.433 --> 31:35.435
-I deserve some money.
-One!

31:35.518 --> 31:38.438
This ain't fair! This here's illegal!

31:38.521 --> 31:40.398
-How much time we got?
-16 minutes!

31:40.481 --> 31:41.816
-Come on!
-Let's go!

31:42.609 --> 31:46.321
(sirens wailing)

31:46.404 --> 31:49.782
2202. We got the heart.
Notify Mercy. We're on our way.

31:49.866 --> 31:51.367
Please let that thing be usable.

31:51.451 --> 31:53.202
-Open it up and check it out.
-Lieutenant!

31:55.747 --> 31:57.373
-(sighs)
-Oh, why, Lord?

31:59.542 --> 32:02.670
What the hell is the matter with you?
You blind and deaf?

32:02.754 --> 32:05.840
Bobby Hill, it is ten blocks to Mercy!

32:05.924 --> 32:08.509
You got a better idea? Let's go!

32:08.593 --> 32:11.846
-(upbeat music playing)
-(horns honking)

32:19.562 --> 32:20.688
RENKO: Hill!

32:22.023 --> 32:23.107
Get in!

32:24.067 --> 32:25.151
Go!

32:26.986 --> 32:28.780

32:37.080 --> 32:40.625

32:52.470 --> 32:56.057
Docket N-639421.

32:56.140 --> 32:58.601
Vivian Dewitt. Disorderly conduct.

32:58.685 --> 33:01.437
WACHTEL: My papers
indicate drug addiction.

33:01.521 --> 33:04.607
You want a detox interview, Ms. Dewitt?

33:04.691 --> 33:06.776
For the detox program?

33:06.859 --> 33:08.027
Correct.

33:08.820 --> 33:11.531
If I don't go in the program,
I got to stay in jail?

33:11.614 --> 33:16.244
I told you, with these disorderlies
it's $25 or 5 days.

33:16.327 --> 33:18.538
-Do you have the $25?
-Uh-huh, I do.

33:18.621 --> 33:20.832
Come on, Ms. Dewitt, full calendar.
What's your pleasure?

33:20.915 --> 33:22.458
One second, Your Honor.

33:22.542 --> 33:24.877
Vivian, what the judge is offering is,

33:24.961 --> 33:27.171
would you want to use
the occasion of your arrest

33:27.255 --> 33:29.132
to get into a cleanup situation?

33:29.215 --> 33:30.675
Just release me, okay?

33:33.094 --> 33:35.138
Ms. Dewitt will pay the fine, Your Honor.

33:35.221 --> 33:36.264
All right.

33:41.978 --> 33:44.355
My papers indicate family somewhere, hmm?

33:45.398 --> 33:46.941
-Children?
-Correct, Your Honor.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.485
You'd rather stay high.
Is that right, Ms. Dewitt?

33:50.570 --> 33:51.654
All right.

33:53.698 --> 33:55.658
You never been high,

33:55.742 --> 33:57.744
so you don't understand what I'm doing.

33:58.369 --> 34:02.040
But the truth is, lady, when I'm high,
I'm feeling better than you'll ever know.

34:02.123 --> 34:05.293
And that's all I want.
And that's all I need.

34:05.376 --> 34:08.921
BAILIFF: Docket N-639414.

34:09.005 --> 34:11.883
Winona Williams. Disorderly conduct.

34:11.966 --> 34:14.302
(indistinct talking)

34:17.430 --> 34:20.349
Gentleman, were you involved
in recovering the Hill Street heart?

34:20.433 --> 34:22.393
No, one of the places where it wasn't.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.525
-What the hell is this?
-We got to talk.

34:33.362 --> 34:35.281
What the hell's your problem?

34:36.199 --> 34:37.241
(door closes)

34:43.372 --> 34:45.792
They found the gun that pimp
was really carrying.

34:45.875 --> 34:46.876
They found two guns?

34:47.960 --> 34:48.961
You believe that?

34:50.296 --> 34:53.174
So? What's the beef?

34:53.257 --> 34:55.384
The guy had, the guy had two pieces.

34:55.468 --> 34:58.012
Wrong, Steger. He drew one weapon. One.

34:58.679 --> 35:00.348
You're starting to annoy me.

35:00.431 --> 35:03.851
I'm getting aggravated.
You just think ahead here.

35:03.935 --> 35:06.687
If you tell them there was only one gun,
you didn't see two weapons,

35:06.771 --> 35:10.316
they're gonna start looking for people
who might have dropped that other gun.

35:10.399 --> 35:13.444
What I keep coming back to
is you sending me away saying,

35:13.528 --> 35:16.906
"Did you take care of everything?"
You dropped the piece, didn't you?

35:16.989 --> 35:19.450
-Hell no, I didn't drop nothing!
-The hell you didn't!

35:19.534 --> 35:20.868
I told you I saw a gun!

35:20.952 --> 35:23.329
We would have found it
if we'd have kept looking,

35:23.412 --> 35:25.540
-but instead, you just dropped one.
-Even if I had,

35:25.623 --> 35:28.709
-it wouldn't have been to hurt you.
-Yeah, great, thanks a lot! Thank you!

35:28.793 --> 35:31.212
-What do you think will happen to me now?
-Don't be stupid.

35:31.295 --> 35:34.173
-Tell them you saw two guns.
-Yeah, I already told them I didn't.

35:34.257 --> 35:36.801
Now, wait a minute. It's real simple.

35:37.593 --> 35:39.220
Real simple. Listen.

35:39.303 --> 35:41.931
You go back in there, you say,

35:42.014 --> 35:44.684
"I was confused and upset
when I made my initial statement."

35:44.767 --> 35:48.020
-You want me to change a sworn statement?
-Calm down.

35:48.104 --> 35:50.314
IAD loves this kind of stuff.

35:50.398 --> 35:51.482
Tell them,

35:51.566 --> 35:54.569
"I remembered something.
I wasn't gonna say nothing.

35:54.652 --> 35:58.197
It's something I thought
I could live with, but I can't."

35:58.281 --> 36:02.660
IAD says, "Ain't this kid great.
He is one straight cop!"

36:02.743 --> 36:05.037
-I don't know.
-Don't give me that whiny crap!

36:05.121 --> 36:07.290
-You gonna be stand-up on this or not?
-I don't know.

36:07.373 --> 36:09.584
I don't know what I'm gonna do!
I just don't know!

36:13.880 --> 36:15.798
-Hey, Ronnie.
-Neal.

36:15.882 --> 36:17.758
-Heard what happened, man.
-Heard what?

36:17.842 --> 36:20.136
You had to take a guy out. Sorry.

36:20.219 --> 36:22.096
Didn't you hear the rest of it?

36:22.180 --> 36:24.348
About me getting caught in the switches?

36:26.142 --> 36:27.435
Oh, I took your advice, Neal.

36:27.518 --> 36:30.646
I spent the $500 on some great
stuff for Robin and Mick, okay?

36:30.730 --> 36:32.315
Wait till you see all I got them.

36:32.398 --> 36:34.525
-They're gonna deliver it to the Kubiak.
-Yeah--

36:34.609 --> 36:37.236
-Hey, looky here: heroes.
-REPORTER: In these days

36:37.320 --> 36:40.198
of manufactured celebrity
and prefab heroes,

36:40.281 --> 36:41.782
it's gratifying occasionally

36:41.866 --> 36:44.327
to be able to report
on the genuine article.

36:44.410 --> 36:47.496
The three members of
the police department standing behind me,

36:47.580 --> 36:49.415
-Officers Robert?
-Hill.

36:49.498 --> 36:51.334
-And Andrew Renko.
-Renko.

36:51.417 --> 36:53.377
-And Norman Buntz.
-Lieutenant Buntz.

36:53.461 --> 36:57.590
Made possible what is coming to be known
as "the six-pack transplant."

36:57.673 --> 37:01.093
Officers, could you tell us
a little more in detail

37:01.177 --> 37:03.554
how you actually recovered the heart?

37:03.638 --> 37:05.890
Uh, we were only doing our job.

37:05.973 --> 37:08.809
Uh, Officer Hill, I recognize you from

37:08.893 --> 37:11.270
-our minicam report at Mercy Hospital.
-Right.

37:11.354 --> 37:13.522
It was you who actually
delivered the heart.

37:13.606 --> 37:15.441
-Uh-huh.
-How did that feel?

37:16.067 --> 37:18.903
Well, I was just hoping
to get it there in time.

37:18.986 --> 37:19.820
Oh, I see.

37:19.904 --> 37:24.450
Lieutenant Buntz, what did you
actually say to Nolan Trevitt,

37:24.533 --> 37:27.787
the man who found the heart
and held it hostage,

37:27.870 --> 37:30.539
to get him to actually release the organ?

37:30.623 --> 37:32.833
Nothing. I threatened him a little.

37:32.917 --> 37:35.419
You gave him a little encouragement then?

37:35.503 --> 37:37.255
Yeah, I told him I'd cut out his heart

37:37.338 --> 37:39.215
if he didn't give over
the one he was holding.

37:39.298 --> 37:42.134
-No, seriously.
-Seriously, yeah.

37:42.218 --> 37:43.302
I see.

37:43.386 --> 37:47.265
Well, back to you, Dave and Trish.

37:47.348 --> 37:49.517
What do you think I did? Kissed him?

38:04.740 --> 38:07.285
Captain? Got a minute?

38:08.411 --> 38:09.328
What's up?

38:10.413 --> 38:13.833
Um? Well, uh,

38:13.916 --> 38:15.751
it's something I thought
I could live with,

38:16.252 --> 38:17.420
but I can't.

38:21.507 --> 38:22.508
(knocks on door)

38:28.389 --> 38:29.515
What's going on, Captain?

38:30.141 --> 38:33.602
Officer Steger alleges
that you confessed to having planted

38:33.686 --> 38:35.521
a weapon at your shoot this morning.

38:36.188 --> 38:38.149
You're lying! You're a lying bastard!

38:38.232 --> 38:41.277
Come on, kid, I'm as sorry
about this as you are.

38:41.360 --> 38:43.112
You deny Officer Steger's allegations?

38:43.195 --> 38:44.613
You're damn right!

38:44.697 --> 38:46.198
Look, I didn't plant a piece.

38:46.741 --> 38:49.452
From the conversation we had this morning,
I'd say it was Steger.

38:49.535 --> 38:50.369
Sure.

38:50.453 --> 38:52.413
You have a right to counsel,
Officer Garfield.

38:52.496 --> 38:54.915
Anything you say from this point on
can be used in evidence

38:54.999 --> 38:56.584
in departmental legal proceedings.

38:57.710 --> 38:59.170
Are you saying you believe that?

39:00.338 --> 39:02.548
Captain, 20 minutes ago this fat old hump

39:02.631 --> 39:04.759
is telling me to say
the perp had two guns.

39:04.842 --> 39:06.469
I got to listen to any more of this?

39:06.552 --> 39:08.137
Mr. Garfield, keep to your desk.

39:13.434 --> 39:17.229
All I want to say is,
what I did, this shoot...

39:17.313 --> 39:18.814
Look, I didn't drop anything.

39:18.898 --> 39:20.858
It was a totally righteous shoot.

39:33.788 --> 39:34.789
(door closes)

39:37.875 --> 39:40.586
So, this is the gentleman
I was telling you about, Mr. Suarez,

39:40.669 --> 39:43.339
that Willie the Cook spoke so highly of.

39:43.422 --> 39:45.174
Mr. Suarez, Mick.

39:45.257 --> 39:46.300
How do you do?

39:47.426 --> 39:49.887
Why you don't come over
from Jimmy Yip in a package?

39:49.970 --> 39:50.846
Bring Willie, too.

39:50.930 --> 39:52.723
Willie ain't available, <i>Señor</i> Suarez.

39:52.807 --> 39:54.725
-Believe me, we asked.
-I cook good as Willie.

39:54.809 --> 39:56.435
That's what Willie said, Mr. Suarez.

39:56.519 --> 39:58.104
Mick cooks as good as he does.

39:58.187 --> 40:00.356
You can imagine how excited we got.

40:00.439 --> 40:02.024
-Where you from?
-He's from Detroit.

40:02.108 --> 40:03.275
Detroit.

40:03.359 --> 40:06.862
Mick makes quality, and he makes weight.

40:06.946 --> 40:07.780
Hmm.

40:09.073 --> 40:11.826
Ready to go? Ready to make some big money?

40:11.909 --> 40:13.577
That's what I'm here for.

40:13.661 --> 40:15.121
He's ready, <i>Señor</i> Suarez.

40:17.915 --> 40:18.833
<i>Bueno.</i>

40:19.667 --> 40:21.043
<i>Veinte pintas...</i>

40:21.836 --> 40:22.962
<i>Veinte horas.</i>

40:24.422 --> 40:26.882
You start right <i>now,</i> Mick.

40:26.966 --> 40:28.259
You're gonna make 20 pints.

40:28.342 --> 40:29.593
<i>Now</i> meaning...

40:29.677 --> 40:32.513
<i>Señor,</i> we are going to be
your new boys in 20 hours.

40:32.596 --> 40:34.306
You're going to have new suppliers.

40:35.099 --> 40:36.725
SUAREZ: What's the matter?

40:36.809 --> 40:38.769
Nothing. Everything's fine.

40:40.187 --> 40:41.063
Okay.

40:41.730 --> 40:43.732
<i>Bueno. Adiós.</i>

40:43.816 --> 40:46.068
We'll be in contact with you,
<i>Señor</i> Suarez.

40:47.319 --> 40:48.821
We're gonna do a great job.

40:54.785 --> 40:56.662
(laughs)

40:56.745 --> 41:00.207
Uh, we got a problem here, fellas.

41:00.291 --> 41:02.293
We're gonna have to stall him tomorrow.

41:03.377 --> 41:04.378
What you talking about?

41:04.462 --> 41:06.881
I gotta see someone. I can't cook tonight.

41:06.964 --> 41:08.716
Look. Very easy.

41:09.425 --> 41:11.260
I'll start first thing in the morning.

41:11.343 --> 41:14.472
You call Suarez, you tell him
that the first batch we mixed

41:14.555 --> 41:15.931
was a little light on pipe.

41:16.015 --> 41:17.850
We'll deliver four hours later.

41:23.731 --> 41:26.901
-What's the problem?
-Are you crazy? Huh?

41:28.402 --> 41:30.529
This is our big audition, Mick.

41:30.613 --> 41:32.198
Our big chance, man.

41:32.281 --> 41:34.658
Man wants it in <i>veinte horas,</i>

41:34.742 --> 41:36.285
that is when he is gonna get it!

41:36.368 --> 41:37.995
I'm telling you I got to be someplace.

41:38.078 --> 41:41.207
And we're telling you
this is the place you're gonna be tonight.

41:42.041 --> 41:43.292
It's a <i>chica,</i> right?

41:44.460 --> 41:46.462
-You got a date.
-Right.

41:47.004 --> 41:49.715
Afraid you gonna have to keep
your pants on tonight, Mick.

41:59.225 --> 42:00.476
(growls)

42:00.559 --> 42:03.354
With due respect to the head
of the gift committee, J.D.,

42:03.437 --> 42:07.233
I think if you put these tennis shoes
where the corned beef is.

42:07.316 --> 42:08.776
It might make a better appearance.

42:08.859 --> 42:11.237
Don't mess with me, Bobby.
I been through hell with this.

42:11.320 --> 42:12.154
All right, pal.

42:12.238 --> 42:14.406
TV REPORTER: <i>Minutes ago</i>
<i>at a hospital news conference,</i>

42:14.490 --> 42:16.450
<i>Dr. Jason Rosenberg announced completion</i>

42:16.534 --> 42:18.994
<i>of what's come to be known as</i>
<i>"the hostage transplant."</i>

42:19.078 --> 42:21.497
-I love all these catchy names, eh?
-(chuckles)

42:21.580 --> 42:24.041
<i>Dr. Rosenberg stated</i>
<i>that the next obstacle</i>

42:24.124 --> 42:26.627
<i>for transplant patient Richard Kavakian</i>

42:26.710 --> 42:28.379
<i>was the possibility that his body</i>

42:28.462 --> 42:31.549
<i>may reject the transplanted organ</i>
<i>as foreign tissue.</i>

42:31.632 --> 42:32.800
Hope the man makes it.

42:32.883 --> 42:34.718
With everything that heart's been through

42:34.802 --> 42:37.137
it could make it through
a nuclear holocaust.

42:40.307 --> 42:41.934
Hey, it's only 20 minutes, right?

42:42.017 --> 42:44.812
Actually, by my watch
he's only 18 minutes late.

42:44.895 --> 42:47.189
I know it's impossible, Robin,
but try to relax.

42:47.273 --> 42:48.691
He's probably held up in traffic.

42:48.774 --> 42:50.985
At this time of night?
He has to come across Van Buren.

42:51.068 --> 42:52.319
He's jammed, totally.

42:52.403 --> 42:54.530
I keep thinking his tux
might have strangled him.

42:54.613 --> 42:56.824
Best man made it through the gridlock.

42:56.907 --> 42:59.201
Well, that puts you one up
on the groom, Sarge.

42:59.285 --> 43:00.661
Phone for Tataglia.

43:08.711 --> 43:09.753
Hi, honey.

43:10.879 --> 43:13.799
Listen, something came up.

43:13.882 --> 43:15.259
<i>I got to break our date tonight.</i>

43:15.342 --> 43:16.844
Mick, tell me if you're all right.

43:16.927 --> 43:18.137
BELKER: <i>I'm fine.</i>

43:18.220 --> 43:20.306
<i>You know how much I wanted</i>
<i>to be with you tonight,</i>

43:20.389 --> 43:24.018
but things started cooking here
sooner than I thought.

43:24.810 --> 43:26.061
Right. I get it.

43:27.187 --> 43:28.188
MICK: <i>You okay?</i>

43:29.315 --> 43:30.399
I'm fine.

43:30.482 --> 43:31.734
I was just worried about you.

43:31.817 --> 43:32.943
I'm fine.

43:34.778 --> 43:36.196
Robin, I'm sorry.

43:36.280 --> 43:37.865
It's okay as long as you're okay.

43:41.994 --> 43:43.078
I love you.

43:50.252 --> 43:51.712
He's okay, but he can't make it.

43:55.674 --> 44:00.054
Robin had asked me to say
well, most importantly, Mick is fine,

44:00.137 --> 44:02.806
but his undercover went red
before any of us expected it,

44:02.890 --> 44:05.392
so we're gonna have to
postpone the ceremony.

44:05.476 --> 44:08.771
-(people groaning)
-I'm sorry, everybody. (crying)

44:10.439 --> 44:11.815
No, I'm okay. I'm fine.

44:12.775 --> 44:14.109
(chuckles) I'm fine.

44:14.193 --> 44:16.820
She took it okay, am I right? Right.

44:16.904 --> 44:18.322
Because I know broads.

44:18.405 --> 44:21.325
You tell them it's work,
it's gonna be money coming in,

44:21.408 --> 44:23.619
and you're gonna buy them
something with that money.

44:24.244 --> 44:26.538
They love it if you got
something important to do.

44:26.622 --> 44:28.332
(growling)

44:30.668 --> 44:32.670
-Mick?
-(growling)

44:34.338 --> 44:35.631
What you doing, Mick?

44:38.592 --> 44:40.219
How'd you do that, Mick?

44:40.302 --> 44:42.971
J.D., you said this refrigerator
would be here an hour.

44:43.055 --> 44:45.057
Well, of course,
we couldn't count on Belker

44:45.140 --> 44:47.726
having the bad taste to be kept
over by some crooks.

44:47.810 --> 44:50.187
I'm just saying,
where am I gonna keep this thing?

44:50.270 --> 44:52.940
You keep it right here
till we find out what's going on.

44:53.023 --> 44:54.149
And you keep it plugged in

44:54.233 --> 44:57.277
so that the perishable presents
I got inside don't rot.

44:58.529 --> 44:59.655
-Lieutenant.
-J.D.

45:01.782 --> 45:04.284
-You really surprised me today, baby.
-How's that?

45:04.368 --> 45:07.287
Well, I kept looking for you
to jam yourself up.

45:07.371 --> 45:09.665
-You never did.
-I guess that's right.

45:10.374 --> 45:12.751
I didn't blow the dough,
I didn't screw around with Rob,

45:12.835 --> 45:14.420
and I got a bunch of nice presents.

45:14.503 --> 45:16.880
-What's left?
-Nothing.

45:17.840 --> 45:19.216
Stealing it. (laughs)

45:19.299 --> 45:21.135
Stealing it. Neal, that's it.

45:21.218 --> 45:23.095
All day, I been asking, "What's my angle?

45:23.178 --> 45:24.221
Where's this going?"

45:24.304 --> 45:26.098
I was meant to steal this refrigerator.

45:26.181 --> 45:29.059
-No, no.
-Why not?

45:29.143 --> 45:31.812
It's too late, man.
You did a good thing today.

45:31.895 --> 45:34.773
Now you just got to learn
to live with it. (laughs)

45:35.691 --> 45:36.984
Hey, it's Shirley.

45:38.902 --> 45:41.071
-Hey, Detective.
-Hey, Ronnie.

45:42.072 --> 45:43.198
How you holding up, man?

45:43.782 --> 45:45.033
Lousy.

45:45.117 --> 45:47.286
I mean, I can't believe
what the guy did to me.

45:47.369 --> 45:50.831
Just stay cool, babe.
And don't make no mistakes.

45:50.914 --> 45:53.667
Seems like the mistake I made
was who I had for a partner.

45:57.254 --> 45:58.547
Look at him.

45:58.630 --> 46:01.425
-Lying piece of garbage!
-Hey, take it easy, Ronnie.

46:01.508 --> 46:02.760
Don't be stupid now.

46:02.843 --> 46:04.011
Hey, Stan.

46:09.475 --> 46:12.144
Uh, Jack, maybe we ought to
head someplace else.

46:12.227 --> 46:14.730
No, no, no, no. Let myself
get run off by that punk?

46:14.813 --> 46:16.648
Bad enough he plants a piece.

46:17.191 --> 46:19.902
Disgraces the badge I wear.
He's not gonna ruin my time off.

46:19.985 --> 46:21.904
-Get me a beer.
-Hey, cool it.

46:21.987 --> 46:23.489
-You bastard!
-Hey!

46:23.572 --> 46:25.616
(all yelling)

46:25.699 --> 46:27.785
-You shouldn't have done it!
-You're framing me.

46:27.868 --> 46:30.496
-You're trying to ruin my life!
-You did it to yourself!

46:30.579 --> 46:32.623
-You punk!
-Come on, let's go.

46:40.631 --> 46:42.591
-Thanks, Luce.
-Yeah.

46:43.300 --> 46:45.344
-You sure you don't need company?
-No, I'm okay.

46:45.427 --> 46:47.262
Okay. Call me if you want
someone to talk to.

46:48.889 --> 46:50.182
-Good night.
-Good night.

47:02.736 --> 47:05.030
What, I got to have a special
reason to call you up?

47:05.823 --> 47:08.116
I just wanted to hear
your sexy voice. (chuckles)

47:09.409 --> 47:10.494
Yeah.

47:12.204 --> 47:14.039
I think about you all the time, Fabe.

47:15.165 --> 47:17.251
Yeah, how's it going
down there and all? I mean,

47:18.001 --> 47:19.002
I miss you.

47:21.547 --> 47:22.506
Yeah.

47:24.174 --> 47:25.300
How's your mom?

47:28.053 --> 47:28.971
Oh.

47:30.055 --> 47:31.723
Is that right? That's great.

47:32.516 --> 47:34.017
Clean and doing good, huh?

47:37.855 --> 47:39.064
I gotta run, Fabe.

47:39.648 --> 47:42.109
Yeah. I miss you.

47:43.110 --> 47:44.278
Yeah. I love you.

47:45.153 --> 47:46.154
Bye-bye, hon.

47:49.449 --> 47:52.786

48:02.880 --> 48:05.924
