WEBVTT

00:01.167 --> 00:02.768
<i>Previously on</i> reign...

00:02.770 --> 00:04.403
Husband? You can't have
found someone already?

00:04.405 --> 00:07.639
<i>We both know you just want</i>
<i>to be rid of me.</i>

00:07.641 --> 00:11.110
Greer, are you telling me that
lord castleroy is a protestant?

00:11.112 --> 00:12.745
Yes.

00:12.747 --> 00:15.214
Did you hire montgomery
to kill our father?

00:15.216 --> 00:16.482
No, I did it myself.

00:16.484 --> 00:18.217
<i>I took montgomery's place.</i>

00:18.219 --> 00:20.152
Narcisse knows,
he's blackmailing me.

00:20.154 --> 00:21.587
He has montgomery hidden
away somewhere.

00:21.589 --> 00:24.356
This is no longer
just about you.

00:24.358 --> 00:27.259
Mary and catherine planned
henry's murder

00:27.261 --> 00:28.494
<i>During private mass.</i>

00:28.496 --> 00:31.163
<i>I spoke</i>
<i>to the attending priest,</i>

00:31.165 --> 00:32.631
And he told me all the details.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.633
Conde: This is
the protestant minister

00:34.635 --> 00:36.402
Whose church was burned down
by catholics.

00:36.404 --> 00:39.038
I did come here
to beg for a new barn.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.473
We have stolen gunpowder,
packed tightly and hidden.

00:41.475 --> 00:42.808
Mary: <i>When we didn't kill</i>
<i>their minister,</i>

00:42.810 --> 00:44.176
<i>They did it themselves.</i>

00:44.178 --> 00:45.344
Man:
This the crown's doing.

00:45.346 --> 00:47.212
Mary: This is what
the radicals wanted.

00:47.214 --> 00:48.480
This is their bomb.

00:49.282 --> 00:51.116
(sheep bleating)

00:53.186 --> 00:55.354
Pierre...?

00:56.289 --> 00:57.256
Pierre?

00:57.258 --> 00:59.058
(clank, thud, man yells)

01:03.196 --> 01:04.430
(startled shout)

01:04.432 --> 01:07.566
(grunting with effort,
panting)

01:08.601 --> 01:10.269
What do you want with me?

01:10.271 --> 01:12.771
You're going to change
the face of France.

01:14.741 --> 01:17.509
(fast tempo acoustic
intro playing)

01:20.146 --> 01:22.448
â™ª they all need something

01:22.450 --> 01:27.352
â™ª to hold on to,
they all mean well â™ª

01:27.354 --> 01:30.856
â™ª you could never
feel my story â™ª

01:30.858 --> 01:34.693
â™ª it's all you know... Oh!

01:34.695 --> 01:37.863
â™ª

01:50.243 --> 01:51.310
Ah.

01:51.312 --> 01:52.644
Allow me.

01:54.714 --> 01:56.548
For you and
your family.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.884
And spread the word about
the feast of st. Nicholas.

01:58.886 --> 02:01.553
It will go on as always
with gifts for the children,

02:01.555 --> 02:04.456
Music and dancing,

02:04.458 --> 02:06.325
And extra food
and provisions for winter.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.326
This is just the start.

02:07.328 --> 02:09.528
More supplies
will be coming.

02:09.530 --> 02:13.398
Begging your majesty, but some
folks were scared to come today.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.634
For those uneasy about
a public gathering,

02:15.636 --> 02:17.669
My representatives
will come to your home

02:17.671 --> 02:21.173
With food and supplies and
no discussion of your faith.

02:21.175 --> 02:23.742
It is the season for
giving, not judging.

02:23.744 --> 02:26.245
The minister hung, right there,

02:26.247 --> 02:29.348
Beaten to death for asking
for a new church.

02:29.350 --> 02:32.384
The crown did not murder your
minister, as I've said before.

02:32.386 --> 02:35.487
I ask you to look ahead,
not backward,

02:35.489 --> 02:37.256
And we will do the same.

02:37.258 --> 02:38.357
Please.

02:38.359 --> 02:39.858
We were
neighbors once,

02:39.860 --> 02:42.461
Living side by side.

02:42.463 --> 02:43.896
We can be again.

02:47.367 --> 02:48.767
Thank you, cousin.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.235
Your presence here means
a great deal,

02:50.237 --> 02:51.570
Given our recent
disagreements.

02:51.572 --> 02:54.773
My politics have left you
more aligned with mary.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.775
At least today, we're united,

02:56.777 --> 02:59.545
To stop France from
tearing itself in half.

02:59.547 --> 03:00.846
I wonder if we can.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.614
Guard:
Your majesty,

03:02.616 --> 03:05.384
Your brother sebastian asks
you return to the castle.

03:06.452 --> 03:08.587
Lively, skipping steps.

03:08.589 --> 03:10.589
Ladies, you haven't
been practicing.

03:14.227 --> 03:15.527
Oh, let's...

03:15.529 --> 03:17.663
Let's take a break,
shall we?

03:17.665 --> 03:19.731
(laughing)

03:21.701 --> 03:23.402
Was that supposed to
be the tarantella?

03:23.404 --> 03:24.469
Princess claude.

03:24.471 --> 03:25.637
It's a new dance.
From Spain.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.639
I would have invited
you to the lesson,

03:27.641 --> 03:29.708
But seeing as you don't respond
to any of my invitations...

03:29.710 --> 03:30.842
Your invitations?

03:30.844 --> 03:32.511
To tea, for riding,

03:32.513 --> 03:34.546
Perhaps a simple thank you
for the tiara I sent you?

03:34.548 --> 03:36.715
The servants get worse
every year.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.450
I swear they forget
I live here now.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.485
But here I am.

03:40.487 --> 03:42.487
And I need all three of you,
desperately.

03:42.489 --> 03:44.623
What do you know
about lord narcisse?

03:46.793 --> 03:49.428
Really? Is it that bad?

03:49.430 --> 03:50.729
Fantastic.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.331
What is he, a whore chaser?

03:52.333 --> 03:54.633
Uh, we cannot
speak to that.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.568
Well, what kind of woman does
narcisse enjoy?

03:56.570 --> 03:58.804
Well, you can't be
asking for yourself.

03:58.806 --> 04:02.407
We can speak to the fact that
he kept his last wife in a cage.

04:02.409 --> 04:06.612
A cage? For punishment,
or for erotic purposes?

04:06.614 --> 04:09.615
Claude, lord narcisse is
completely unsuitable for you.

04:09.617 --> 04:12.584
He's schemer, a liar,
and he's dangerous.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.586
Perfect.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.355
Mother's been foisting me
on boring suitors

04:16.357 --> 04:17.589
Utterly beneath me.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.758
An affair.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.493
A very public, juicy affair,

04:21.495 --> 04:22.828
With a notorious old
man would obliterate

04:22.830 --> 04:24.997
Any chance she has
of marrying me off.

04:24.999 --> 04:27.332
Mary: Catherine would
have you shackled,

04:27.334 --> 04:28.967
Bound and thrown into the sea.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.502
As to these
other suitors,

04:30.504 --> 04:31.970
Why would catherine
want you to wed

04:31.972 --> 04:33.605
Beneath your station?

04:33.607 --> 04:35.907
Who you marry, it's
a strategic alliance for France.

04:35.909 --> 04:37.576
Claude: The only alliance
I'm interested in is

04:37.578 --> 04:40.045
Temporary, delicious, in bed.

04:42.582 --> 04:44.583
Francis...

04:44.585 --> 04:46.551
If this is about the village
this morning,

04:46.553 --> 04:48.587
I didn't ask you because
things there are still tense.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.589
Things are tense
across France,

04:50.591 --> 04:53.358
But I have an idea,
so hear me out, please.

04:53.360 --> 04:55.727
What if your sister
claude married condÃ©?

04:56.996 --> 04:58.630
Marry a royal to one

04:58.632 --> 05:00.632
Of the most prominent
protestants in the country?

05:00.634 --> 05:01.633
Yes.

05:01.635 --> 05:02.701
An interfaith marriage.

05:02.703 --> 05:03.902
In your family.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.037
It sends a message.

05:05.039 --> 05:06.638
It certainly does.

05:08.007 --> 05:10.008
Marriages have been making
alliances for centuries.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.010
It's a custom the
people understand.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.578
By bringing condÃ©
into your family,

05:13.580 --> 05:16.381
You exemplify
acceptance, tolerance,

05:16.383 --> 05:17.582
People living
together in peace.

05:17.584 --> 05:19.017
I can't.

05:19.019 --> 05:20.952
The nobles will rise against me.

05:20.954 --> 05:23.955
The marriage won't confer any
real power on the protestants,

05:23.957 --> 05:25.624
But it would be
a balm to them.

05:25.626 --> 05:28.460
Insurance from them
rising up against you.

05:28.462 --> 05:29.561
Against us.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.530
I'm sorry, my answer...

05:31.532 --> 05:33.532
Is no.
As I knew it would be.

05:33.534 --> 05:36.535
You have fallen
completely to the nobles.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.337
But I had to try.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.606
Francis: You said there was
a development with narcisse.

05:41.608 --> 05:43.342
Did you find
montgomery?

05:43.344 --> 05:45.010
No, but I'm hoping the
man inside can help.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.978
It's father michael, the
priest catherine was going

05:46.980 --> 05:48.380
To use to
poison henry.

05:48.382 --> 05:50.349
The one narcisse was hiding
to use against us.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.386
Please, your grace,

05:54.388 --> 05:56.421
I've been a loyal servant
to your queen mother for years.

05:56.423 --> 05:57.689
Ask her.

05:57.691 --> 05:58.957
Narcisse threatened
my parents and sister

05:58.959 --> 06:00.559
If I didn't do what he said.

06:00.561 --> 06:03.128
You mean stand ready to indict
queen mary and my mother

06:03.130 --> 06:04.429
Of attempted regicide?

06:04.431 --> 06:06.465
(quietly):
Yes.

06:06.467 --> 06:10.102
Father michael, do you know
where lord narcisse was keeping

06:10.104 --> 06:12.137
Another hostage--
lord montgomery?

06:12.139 --> 06:16.541
No, the only man I saw, rather
than the guard, was balfont.

06:16.543 --> 06:17.943
Narcisse's man.
He brought food

06:17.945 --> 06:20.479
And checked on me
every two or three days.

06:20.481 --> 06:22.047
I did hear balfont say once,

06:22.049 --> 06:23.882
Because the guard was
sick of watching me,

06:23.884 --> 06:26.785
That the man who was guarding
montgomery had it much worse.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.086
Balfont also checked
on montgomery?

06:28.088 --> 06:30.455
He seemed to be
in charge of us.

06:30.457 --> 06:32.124
When is balfont due
to visit you next?

06:32.126 --> 06:33.825
He came two days ago.

06:33.827 --> 06:36.461
So, perhaps today,
or tomorrow.

06:36.463 --> 06:38.130
When balfont sees
that father michael's missing,

06:38.132 --> 06:39.731
He'll run straight to narcisse.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.134
Balfont could be on his way
to the farmhouse now.

06:42.136 --> 06:45.570
Narcisse will know that we're
eliminating his witnesses.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.672
And play his hand by
bringing montgomery

06:47.674 --> 06:49.441
To court to accuse
you of regicide.

06:49.443 --> 06:51.009
We have to find
montgomery.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.444
There's no turning
back now.

06:52.446 --> 06:54.746
I have to get out
from underneath narcisse.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.415
I've lost control
of my country,

06:56.417 --> 06:58.417
And my own wife
can hardly look at me.

06:58.419 --> 06:59.684
I'll have
balfont followed.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.422
Or we capture and torture him

07:03.424 --> 07:05.490
Till he reveals
montgomery's location.

07:05.492 --> 07:07.492
No, we can't be sure
that he'll talk.

07:07.494 --> 07:10.162
And narcisse will miss him.

07:10.164 --> 07:13.498
Narcisse will order balfont
to fetch montgomery.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.000
We follow balfont.

07:15.002 --> 07:17.002
It's a dangerous play.

07:17.004 --> 07:19.538
For all his threats, narcisse
might not want you gone.

07:19.540 --> 07:22.207
Your successor could
be worse in his mind.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.675
Then I'll have to push him.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.143
And I know just how.

07:27.213 --> 07:29.481
Francis:
Mary...

07:32.185 --> 07:34.786
I've changed my mind
about claude and condÃ©.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.788
You were right.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.724
The marriage is a good option,
a viable path towards peace.

07:39.726 --> 07:40.926
We'll announce
their engagement tonight

07:40.928 --> 07:42.127
At the st. Nicholas feast.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.195
Well, what
about the nobles?

07:43.197 --> 07:44.863
I'll deal with the nobles.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.865
Using your argument
that a stable France,

07:46.867 --> 07:49.868
Cheaply bought with a marriage,
benefits them most of all.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.870
I'm afraid
to believe you.

07:51.872 --> 07:55.073
You've been so erratic lately,
as you are now.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.242
Please speak with
claude and condÃ©.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.144
I could force
their engagement,

07:59.146 --> 08:01.079
But it would hardly engender
good will, on either side.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.648
Don't go back
on your word, francis.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.050
I'm trusting you.

08:05.052 --> 08:07.652
Don't give me hope
for France, for us,

08:07.654 --> 08:08.954
And then take it away again.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.601
Mary: It's strange--
though you never set out to be,

08:22.603 --> 08:25.804
You are the most visible
protestant leader in France.

08:25.806 --> 08:28.807
You're a noble,
and a prince of the blood.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.575
They look up
to you, louis.

08:30.577 --> 08:33.578
Now I feel a creeping
sense of unease.

08:33.580 --> 08:35.580
Because you've come
to know me.

08:35.582 --> 08:37.582
I ask for things.

08:37.584 --> 08:39.818
And I am asking you
if you would become

08:39.820 --> 08:42.153
A symbol
for all of France.

08:45.892 --> 08:48.827
Would you consider marrying
the princess claude?

08:52.231 --> 08:54.266
You're serious.

08:54.268 --> 08:56.268
You and francis?

08:56.270 --> 08:59.271
Yes, francis has agreed.

08:59.273 --> 09:04.543
Your marriage would help ease
religious violence and distrust.

09:04.545 --> 09:06.545
The realm seems calm now,
but that's only

09:06.547 --> 09:09.147
Because those who have been
beaten down are terrified.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.550
We must do
something now.

09:11.552 --> 09:13.285
Claude is not my choice
of an ideal wife--

09:13.287 --> 09:16.288
She's young, and I admit I
haven't met her officially,

09:16.290 --> 09:18.290
But I've heard enough
to know she's a terror.

09:18.292 --> 09:21.026
Yes, you prefer
your women more mature.

09:21.028 --> 09:23.094
And married.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.096
Ever since I converted,

09:25.098 --> 09:27.299
My brother, the king of navarre,
has been in negotiations

09:27.301 --> 09:29.301
For me to marry a
protestant duchess.

09:29.303 --> 09:32.704
But you'd be marrying into
the royal family-- a princess.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.639
It's a far superior alliance
for him to make.

09:34.641 --> 09:36.107
And have you even met
this duchess?

09:36.109 --> 09:37.309
She could be worse.

09:37.311 --> 09:39.711
I didn't fully agree
to her, either.

09:39.713 --> 09:42.714
Louis, we've been given so much,
just by birth.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.849
And I know that
I'm asking you to give up

09:44.851 --> 09:46.851
Something enormous in return.

09:46.853 --> 09:48.219
But if it saved lives,

09:48.221 --> 09:50.722
Changed France,
and possibly

09:50.724 --> 09:54.059
Brought you happiness with a
spirited, beautiful princess...

09:54.061 --> 09:55.894
Isn't it worth considering?

09:57.196 --> 09:58.697
You know you could
sell the ocean

09:58.699 --> 10:00.031
A cup of water, don't you?

10:00.033 --> 10:02.334
Are you saying...?

10:02.336 --> 10:03.868
Yes, I'll do it.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.370
I'll marry claude.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.372
This will change everything.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.074
I'll be your
brother-in-law.

10:09.076 --> 10:10.675
Living at court,

10:10.677 --> 10:13.144
A part of your
family, forever.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.914
Our children will grow up
side by side.

10:15.916 --> 10:18.917
The times we have
banded together,

10:18.919 --> 10:20.986
You have been a brave--
a very brave--

10:20.988 --> 10:23.321
Like-minded friend.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.323
Which is why we will
be overjoyed

10:25.325 --> 10:27.025
To bring you
into our lives.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.927
Both mine and francis's.

10:28.929 --> 10:31.730
So when do I meet
my future wife?

10:31.732 --> 10:33.732
Who are <i>you</i>
<i>to arrange my future?</i>

10:33.734 --> 10:35.734
I don't need a husband.

10:35.736 --> 10:38.703
I already have a mother
to make me miserable.

10:38.705 --> 10:40.772
CondÃ© would hardly
make you miserable.

10:40.774 --> 10:43.008
He's young, dashing, rich,

10:43.010 --> 10:45.076
Powerful--
the list goes on.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.911
At least meet him before
you dismiss him out of hand.

10:46.913 --> 10:49.247
He sounds like
a charming pair of shackles.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.749
Claude, in this moment,

10:50.751 --> 10:53.852
The very future of France
rests in your hands.

10:53.854 --> 10:56.187
Oh, then we are in dire,
dire circumstances.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.189
Oh, sweet lord.
Claude:
Incredible.

10:58.191 --> 11:00.358
The merest whiff of marriage
brings you running.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.760
Like a bloodhound.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.962
One needs to be quick
to keep track of you.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.096
I will not have
a protestant,

11:05.098 --> 11:06.398
Let alone a bourbon,
marry claude.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.433
Lord condÃ© could make a claim
to the throne--

11:08.435 --> 11:10.301
He has royal blood of his own.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.303
CondÃ© will never rule.

11:12.305 --> 11:13.705
And I will never marry him.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.674
Oh, hallelujah!

11:15.676 --> 11:17.208
We're
in agreement.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.444
This may be a bona fide miracle.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.845
Stop. The truth is,

11:20.847 --> 11:22.947
If the king wants
this marriage to happen,

11:22.949 --> 11:24.349
It   <i>wil</i>happen.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.850
Tell the king--

11:25.852 --> 11:28.953
My brother--
that I am not a brood mare

11:28.955 --> 11:31.289
To be bartered and sold.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.291
By any of you.

11:35.428 --> 11:37.829
Catherine, help me.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.130
It's a good marriage.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.166
You've been dying
to marry claude off.

11:41.168 --> 11:43.468
CondÃ© is a protestant,
yes, but he's rich,

11:43.470 --> 11:45.303
And his brother is a king.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.439
He resides here now.
At the moment, yes.

11:47.441 --> 11:50.442
Then he solves
nothing for me.

11:51.811 --> 11:54.145
Claude will only be happy
away from the castle.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.480
And why is that?

11:55.482 --> 11:57.082
She is my daughter.

11:57.084 --> 12:00.018
It is my right and duty
to map her life.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.786
Uh, if you ever

12:01.788 --> 12:03.922
Have children,
you'll understand that.

12:03.924 --> 12:06.858
Do not lay a hand on her future.

12:12.465 --> 12:13.798
In all our ventures
together,

12:13.800 --> 12:15.767
I've never seen
your husband so happy.

12:15.769 --> 12:18.103
There's a light in his eyes
that clearly you put there.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.504
He is a charmer.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.473
What's happening
with the school?

12:21.475 --> 12:23.141
Did my funding
help it complete?

12:23.143 --> 12:24.843
Jacob: Hugo, can you
update us all?

12:24.845 --> 12:26.244
Hugo's our money man.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.812
He's been on top of some issues

12:27.814 --> 12:29.814
With the construction.
Hugo:
Yes.

12:29.816 --> 12:31.850
Fighting in chambord
delayed the materials.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.518
We're working
on another route.
I'm sorry,

12:33.520 --> 12:36.154
Am I to understand you're
financing this movement?

12:36.156 --> 12:37.255
Building a school, dear.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.424
In an under-serviced
region.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.426
And I...
I'm merely one of the donors.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.862
Lily: It feels good
to be involved.

12:43.864 --> 12:46.097
Can I share with you
some of our other projects?

12:46.099 --> 12:48.867
I'd like that.

12:48.869 --> 12:51.436
But first, let me show you
the gardens you were

12:51.438 --> 12:53.238
Asking about.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.275
This luncheon is
about a bit more

12:57.277 --> 12:59.043
Than meeting your friends,
isn't it?

12:59.045 --> 13:01.780
You're trying to convert me.
I was hoping
if you saw

13:01.782 --> 13:04.516
How much good work we do,
how reasonable they are...

13:04.518 --> 13:06.918
I'd come to your side?
Well, that's
just it,

13:06.920 --> 13:08.520
I don't want there to be sides.

13:08.522 --> 13:12.791
I want us to be together,
in all things.

13:13.125 --> 13:16.361
â™ª

13:20.132 --> 13:22.267
Very nice.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.369
I see mary's point now.

13:24.371 --> 13:25.870
She sent you to woo me,
didn't she?

13:25.872 --> 13:27.872
Yes.
How's it going so far?

13:27.874 --> 13:29.374
Hard to say.

13:29.376 --> 13:30.809
Tell me this:

13:30.811 --> 13:32.811
Do you always do mary's bidding?

13:32.813 --> 13:35.814
Or does your ambition
spark this desire
for a royal marriage?

13:35.816 --> 13:38.950
Are you in need
of money? Lands?

13:38.952 --> 13:41.986
I have vast holdings,
and I am well...

13:41.988 --> 13:43.555
Endowed?
(wry laugh)

13:43.557 --> 13:45.223
Provided for--

13:45.225 --> 13:47.458
Through my family
and my own enterprises.

13:47.460 --> 13:48.827
Oh.

13:48.829 --> 13:51.563
Well, I haven't
seen your... Region...

13:51.565 --> 13:53.832
But I assume it's satisfying.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.233
That is the popular view.

13:55.235 --> 13:56.935
Of your many lovers,
that's right.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.603
I hear you are

13:58.605 --> 14:01.172
Quite the ruiner
of noble married women.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.141
That is slander.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.609
They returned to
their husbands in...

14:04.611 --> 14:08.346
Finer spirits than when
they went on holiday.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.882
And would you
break their hearts,

14:10.884 --> 14:12.617
Or keep them warm and
waiting on the side,

14:12.619 --> 14:13.985
If we did marry?

14:13.987 --> 14:16.254
Would I be able
to have lovers, too?

14:16.256 --> 14:17.856
Ideally, no.

14:17.858 --> 14:19.390
To us both.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.426
I know it's awkward--
we've been tossed together,

14:21.428 --> 14:23.261
The would-be saviors
of France-- but...

14:23.263 --> 14:24.629
We can take our time.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.631
Even after marriage,
I wouldn't force you...

14:26.633 --> 14:29.634
Why downplay the only
remotely interesting
thing about this union?

14:29.636 --> 14:31.369
Why, indeed.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.238
But it's not
the only interesting thing.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.440
If we do wed, and we
dislike each other,

14:35.442 --> 14:39.043
We could find a way to...
Be free but married.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.612
Or perhaps we'll find
that in each other

14:40.614 --> 14:43.615
There's someone we're
willing to be tethered to.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.087
(door opens)

14:49.089 --> 14:50.989
I've just learned
that you have given

14:50.991 --> 14:52.557
Consent to your sister's
marriage to condÃ©.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.893
Have you lost your mind?

14:54.895 --> 14:56.527
Can't you work with me,
for once?

14:56.529 --> 14:58.596
France is on the verge
of a revolt.

14:58.598 --> 15:00.431
You are wrong.
All is quiet.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.000
(scoffs)
you've cracked
a few skulls--

15:02.002 --> 15:04.269
A painful method
of instilling order,

15:04.271 --> 15:05.904
But one that
has worked.

15:05.906 --> 15:07.338
When push comes to
shove, people will

15:07.340 --> 15:09.974
Trade their faith
for survival.
No, I don't trust

15:09.976 --> 15:11.009
That it's over.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.011
I was in the midst of that riot.

15:13.013 --> 15:15.680
I saw stones thrown,
frenchmen attacking frenchmen.

15:15.682 --> 15:18.349
People died! I...

15:18.351 --> 15:21.019
I haven't slept in days.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.954
My sister's marriage
may not be enough.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.622
I may have to reverse the edict,

15:24.624 --> 15:26.190
Or issue a new one
protecting protestants.

15:27.626 --> 15:30.662
You do not seem yourself,
my king.

15:30.664 --> 15:33.064
That is because I am <i>your</i> king,
not my own.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.332
I can't do
this anymore.

15:34.334 --> 15:35.566
I won't.

15:35.568 --> 15:38.002
<i>If</i> you allow this marriage

15:38.004 --> 15:41.005
To go ahead, I <i>will</i>
<i>remove you from the throne.</i>

15:41.007 --> 15:43.074
Have you forgotten
what I can do to you,

15:43.076 --> 15:44.475
What I know about you?

15:44.477 --> 15:46.411
I can't live like this anymore!

15:46.413 --> 15:48.079
And what of mary...

15:48.081 --> 15:49.314
And your line?

15:49.316 --> 15:51.249
I can't think about that.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.684
They'll survive.

15:52.686 --> 15:54.552
Somehow.

15:54.554 --> 15:57.655
Or perhaps we are all doomed
by my mistakes.

15:59.224 --> 16:03.127
Francis... You said yourself
you haven't slept in days.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.296
Perhaps what you
need now is rest.

16:05.298 --> 16:08.166
Oh... Now you care
about my health?

16:08.168 --> 16:11.302
All I am saying is that you need
not make any decisions today.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.971
There are no
crises looming

16:12.973 --> 16:15.974
<i>Except</i> that those you create.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.575
Leave me.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.377
I will not have you
hissing in my ear.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.313
Let me be, let me rest.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.248
(softly):
Yes.

16:33.092 --> 16:35.493
You think
he was convinced?

16:35.495 --> 16:37.595
I'm not sure <i>I</i> want you
to be king anymore.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.263
(bash laughing quietly)
good.

16:39.265 --> 16:42.100
Then he'll move
to take my head.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.207
Claude: <i>I'm not sure</i>
<i>it's safe to let you</i>

16:49.209 --> 16:50.375
<i>In my chambers</i>
<i>without a chaperone.</i>

16:50.377 --> 16:51.776
You're not safe.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.778
But not because of me.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.113
Do you realize

16:55.115 --> 16:56.748
What will happen if you go ahead

16:56.750 --> 16:58.349
With this marriage to condÃ©?

16:58.351 --> 17:00.551
You've made friends at court.
You'll be

17:00.553 --> 17:02.620
Nothing less than a test

17:02.622 --> 17:05.523
To see if a mixed union
can survive without one

17:05.525 --> 17:07.158
Or both of you
being assassinated.

17:08.127 --> 17:10.094
And why such concern

17:10.096 --> 17:11.295
For me?

17:11.297 --> 17:13.097
We've only just met.

17:13.099 --> 17:14.766
Oh, don't be coy.

17:14.768 --> 17:17.135
You've already
used me once

17:17.137 --> 17:19.303
To get out
of marrying a suitor.

17:19.305 --> 17:22.473
And there have been
the glances between us.

17:22.475 --> 17:25.476
A look is not a purchase.
Marry me.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.078
Elope with me now

17:27.080 --> 17:29.113
Before anyone can stop us--
it will save your life.

17:29.115 --> 17:31.082
And raise your station.

17:31.084 --> 17:32.316
Marry me...

17:32.318 --> 17:34.719
Or your brother will force you
to marry condÃ©.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.121
No one forces me to do anything.

17:37.123 --> 17:40.725
As king,
he trumps us all.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.594
But if we were to wed...

17:43.596 --> 17:46.564
We would forge a bond...

17:46.566 --> 17:49.834
That only the vatican
could break.

17:53.806 --> 17:55.807
So many suitors...

17:55.809 --> 17:58.342
And lord condÃ© is so young.

17:59.311 --> 18:01.179
Go on.

18:02.214 --> 18:05.483
And handsome.

18:05.485 --> 18:08.086
And well positioned.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.555
And worth being
assassinated for?

18:10.557 --> 18:13.091
If you want something
to die for,

18:13.093 --> 18:15.126
I can give it to you.

18:17.196 --> 18:18.329
(sighs)

18:18.331 --> 18:20.331
I'll think about it.

18:20.333 --> 18:23.167
As I trust you
will think about me.

18:27.206 --> 18:29.173
You may go.

18:34.446 --> 18:37.582
Claude:
<i>Why are you sacrificing me</i>
<i>for an alliance</i>

18:37.584 --> 18:39.617
With protestants?
Why does lord narcisse

18:39.619 --> 18:43.187
Care more about my welfare
than my own brother?
Claude, as royals,

18:43.189 --> 18:45.223
We are all at risk
every day.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.858
But your marriage to condÃ©
could bring peace to France.

18:46.860 --> 18:49.861
I care about me,
not France.

18:49.863 --> 18:51.529
That's <i>your</i> job.

18:51.531 --> 18:52.697
Please listen to me.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.398
Narcisse is trying
to scare you,

18:54.400 --> 18:56.267
To serve his own purposes.
Do you really think

18:56.269 --> 18:57.802
He cares
whether you live or die?

18:57.804 --> 18:59.770
He did offer
to marry me himself,

18:59.772 --> 19:02.140
So he could attach himself
to the royal line.

19:02.142 --> 19:03.708
Of course he did.

19:03.710 --> 19:06.344
Claude, as your king,
I could order you

19:06.346 --> 19:08.312
To marry condÃ©, however
I am urging you to do it

19:08.314 --> 19:09.881
As a member of this family.

19:09.883 --> 19:12.850
I'm asking you
to step forward in a way

19:12.852 --> 19:15.253
You never had to,
never been asked to.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.721
For years, you have
been writing me letters

19:16.723 --> 19:18.456
Saying you felt
you had no real place

19:18.458 --> 19:19.891
Among your own blood.

19:19.893 --> 19:21.726
You want to be accepted,

19:21.728 --> 19:24.328
Respected--
this is your chance
I do.

19:24.330 --> 19:27.231
This is your time...
To fulfill your duty,

19:27.233 --> 19:29.233
Your destiny as a valois.

19:29.235 --> 19:31.536
I'm asking you
to do it for me--
the one person

19:31.538 --> 19:33.237
Who has accepted
and protected you

19:33.239 --> 19:34.906
No matter how far
you transgressed.

19:34.908 --> 19:37.241
Go to narcisse now,

19:37.243 --> 19:39.177
Turn down his proposal.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.314
I'm marrying condÃ©.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.816
But thanks anyway for
your selfless offer.

19:45.818 --> 19:47.919
Are you prepared to die
for this marriage?

19:49.955 --> 19:51.322
At least my family

19:51.324 --> 19:53.257
Will cry at my funeral.

19:55.227 --> 19:57.495
Get lord montgomery,
bring him here to the castle.

19:57.497 --> 20:00.331
We are pressing
regicide charges today.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.300
Francis is crumbling
under the pressure.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.302
He's defiant but defeated.

20:04.304 --> 20:07.305
He needs to go before he makes
decisions that I cannot reverse.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.307
You think catherine
will be regent?
Most likely.

20:09.309 --> 20:10.541
It's not ideal,

20:10.543 --> 20:12.343
<i>But</i> she is a staunch catholic,

20:12.345 --> 20:14.745
And she'll be mourning
the loss of her son,

20:14.747 --> 20:16.948
Scrambling to prepare
a child for the throne.

20:16.950 --> 20:17.982
So she'll need help.

20:17.984 --> 20:19.717
She'll need me.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.252
Now, go.

20:22.988 --> 20:25.323
Narcisse has met
with balfont.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.258
Why aren't you
following him?

20:27.260 --> 20:29.961
I had the stable hands delay
balfont's horse to give us time.

20:29.963 --> 20:31.629
I'm coming with you
to get montgomery.

20:31.631 --> 20:34.265
You'll need help
against balfont, and
no one else can know

20:34.267 --> 20:36.267
That montgomery's
being held, ready to
be brought against me.

20:36.269 --> 20:38.302
I should argue against it
for your safety,

20:38.304 --> 20:40.404
But we have one chance
and we cannot fail.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.240
If we fail, remember...

20:42.242 --> 20:44.375
I'll get mary to the safe house
and out of the country.

20:44.377 --> 20:46.010
She can never return
to France or scotland.

20:46.012 --> 20:47.878
Mary will never be found.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.981
She'll live the rest
of her life in exile,
in anonymity.

20:49.983 --> 20:51.349
But she'll live--

20:51.351 --> 20:53.417
And my death
would be worth it.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.386
Mary...

20:55.388 --> 20:57.955
Francis.

20:59.791 --> 21:01.559
Mary, I love you.

21:01.561 --> 21:04.962
You do know that,
no matter what I've done.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.697
What's happened?

21:06.699 --> 21:08.532
Nothing.

21:08.534 --> 21:10.468
It's just the season.

21:10.470 --> 21:11.836
Makes one take stock
of the year.

21:11.838 --> 21:14.305
Well, then,
let's enjoy the season.

21:14.307 --> 21:16.741
Shall we get ready
for the feast together?

21:16.743 --> 21:20.511
There are a few things
I have to take care of first.

21:20.513 --> 21:22.346
But don't worry.

21:22.348 --> 21:23.481
All is well.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.283
All right then.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.988
Mary, wait a minute-- I know
you're still angry but...

21:30.990 --> 21:33.457
Let me look at you.

21:39.398 --> 21:41.599
Enough?

21:41.601 --> 21:43.668
Not nearly.

21:55.614 --> 21:58.316
â™ª

22:16.335 --> 22:20.838
(elegant music playing)

22:25.977 --> 22:28.479
Presents
for the servants.

22:28.481 --> 22:29.847
How progressive.

22:29.849 --> 22:32.049
Hmm. You have no idea.

22:32.051 --> 22:34.085
Oh, I'm afraid I do.

22:34.087 --> 22:36.487
The engagement will be announced
tonight, will it not?

22:36.489 --> 22:41.425
The plan to mix your blood line
with protestants. Bourbons.

22:41.427 --> 22:44.628
I did what I could
to stop it.
I heard.

22:44.630 --> 22:47.365
Stay away from my daughter.

22:47.367 --> 22:48.799
You cannot support
this engagement.

22:48.801 --> 22:51.635
Do I look pleased?
But I am not king.

22:51.637 --> 22:54.472
Pity. You would have
made a good one.

22:56.141 --> 22:58.109
To what might have been.

22:58.111 --> 22:59.443
Hmm.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.147
Have you seen francis?

23:03.149 --> 23:04.615
Bash said they'd gone
into town.

23:04.617 --> 23:06.117
The vatican heard rumors
of the engagement,

23:06.119 --> 23:08.719
So francis is doing his best
to smooth things over.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.454
So that's where he went.

23:10.456 --> 23:12.923
I'm amazed to hear francis
approved the engagement.

23:12.925 --> 23:14.158
So was I.

23:14.160 --> 23:17.395
I'm proud of him.

23:20.899 --> 23:24.435
It's too quiet, too calm.

23:24.437 --> 23:25.903
Mary, it's peace...

23:25.905 --> 23:28.472
Hard-earned,
after all the strife.

23:28.474 --> 23:32.076
Can't help but wonder
how long it'll last.

23:37.149 --> 23:39.784
You are such a
lovely dancer.

23:39.786 --> 23:41.919
(both laugh quietly)

23:41.921 --> 23:43.687
We've fallen in step
with each other,

23:43.689 --> 23:47.758
But someone must lead the way,
and you're good at that.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.794
And I trust you.

23:49.796 --> 23:51.695
Otherwise, I wouldn't
have married you.

23:51.697 --> 23:54.165
Are you considering converting?

23:54.167 --> 23:55.666
I am.

23:55.668 --> 23:57.802
I think it's better
for your children,

23:57.804 --> 24:02.506
For our home, if we are united,
even if the country is divided.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.677
I think we should leave.

24:06.679 --> 24:08.045
No one heard us.

24:08.047 --> 24:09.713
I want to take you home

24:09.715 --> 24:11.916
And add to our undivided family.

24:11.918 --> 24:13.751
(laughs)

24:13.753 --> 24:15.953
Man:
Wheat and mill over here,

24:15.955 --> 24:17.755
Dried meats there,

24:17.757 --> 24:19.924
Woolens and tools
round that corner.

24:20.926 --> 24:21.926
Is that everything?

24:21.928 --> 24:23.561
From this round of supplies.

24:23.563 --> 24:25.796
Then go back to court
and pick up the next.

24:36.141 --> 24:38.509
Mind the blood-- we'll need
the uniform. Hurry now!

24:38.511 --> 24:40.644
(whistles)
let's get to the carriage!

24:41.213 --> 24:43.013
Hurry! Hurry!

24:44.216 --> 24:47.718
I'm going to announce
your engagement.

24:47.720 --> 24:49.787
Well, where's francis?
Why isn't he here?

24:49.789 --> 24:52.256
He's gone with bash to soothe
relations with the vatican.

24:52.258 --> 24:54.558
Well, shouldn't we wait?

24:54.560 --> 24:56.093
Do you think
he'll change his mind?

24:56.095 --> 24:58.529
I don't think so, not this time.

24:59.931 --> 25:02.833
I know that you've lost faith
in him,

25:02.835 --> 25:05.236
And I told him that I had, too,

25:05.238 --> 25:07.037
But the truth is

25:07.039 --> 25:08.806
I love him,

25:08.808 --> 25:11.642
And no matter what he does,
I believe in him.

25:12.811 --> 25:15.212
They say
that marriage is like a promise,

25:15.214 --> 25:17.014
And it is that,

25:17.016 --> 25:22.186
But the best ones
are based on certainty.

25:22.188 --> 25:25.689
An inexplicable faith
in someone else.

25:31.029 --> 25:33.631
Ladies and gentlemen
of the court,

25:33.633 --> 25:34.865
I have an announcement to make.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.934
With the king's blessing,

25:36.936 --> 25:39.703
It is my honor
to announce the engagement

25:39.705 --> 25:41.639
Of his beloved sister,

25:41.641 --> 25:45.009
The princess claude,
to louis, the prince of condÃ©.

25:45.011 --> 25:47.645
Their union will be eternal,

25:47.647 --> 25:49.580
And their love
unbreakable.

25:49.582 --> 25:51.015
Wish them well.

25:51.017 --> 25:54.652
(crowd murmuring)

25:59.224 --> 26:01.625
Ah. Short and sweet.

26:01.627 --> 26:03.627
Like forcing food
down a duck's throat

26:03.629 --> 26:05.162
To make fois gras.

26:05.164 --> 26:06.830
One can barely hear

26:06.832 --> 26:09.633
The sound of people
choking on the news.

26:21.279 --> 26:23.747
(crickets chirping)

26:39.331 --> 26:40.898
(grunting)

26:46.871 --> 26:48.772
(groaning)

26:55.013 --> 26:56.747
Francis:
Lord montgomery.

26:56.749 --> 26:59.049
Do you know who I am?

26:59.051 --> 27:00.351
Yes.

27:00.353 --> 27:01.986
What do you
want with me?

27:01.988 --> 27:03.721
Have you come here to free me?

27:03.723 --> 27:05.122
I'm sorry
that you've been imprisoned

27:05.124 --> 27:06.390
For so many months,

27:06.392 --> 27:08.726
But it's not your freedom
I'm here for.

27:08.728 --> 27:10.628
It's mine.

27:14.099 --> 27:15.633
Where's reynaud?

27:15.635 --> 27:17.668
I thought he was driving.

27:21.406 --> 27:25.242
Reynaud's back at the village
with a girl.

27:25.244 --> 27:28.178
Giving her more than a blanket
to keep her warm, I expect.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.747
(chuckles)

27:32.417 --> 27:34.385
(gate creaks open)

27:34.387 --> 27:36.320
(gate squeaking)

27:39.124 --> 27:41.759
Are you ready to kill a king?

27:46.398 --> 27:47.731
I'm leaving tonight.

27:47.733 --> 27:48.932
Follow tomorrow
with the carriage

27:48.934 --> 27:52.136
But not until tomorrow.
Do you understand?

27:52.138 --> 27:55.072
It isn't urgent?
It's urgent that I get
some distance from her.

27:55.074 --> 27:57.941
This says I killed the king.

27:57.943 --> 27:59.376
I was already
pardoned for this.

27:59.378 --> 28:02.179
This grants you my pardon,
as I am now king,

28:02.181 --> 28:04.081
But it requires your confession.

28:11.823 --> 28:13.290
Bash: You said narcisse
had you kidnapped.

28:13.292 --> 28:14.992
Surely,
he must have visited you,

28:14.994 --> 28:16.927
Talked with you.
Do you know why

28:16.929 --> 28:17.928
You were kidnapped?

28:17.930 --> 28:19.363
No.

28:19.365 --> 28:21.131
Bash:
Narcisse said

28:21.133 --> 28:23.701
You had conversations about
who really killed the king.

28:23.703 --> 28:25.903
It says right
there I did.

28:25.905 --> 28:28.105
He's lying. I don't
know why he took me.

28:28.107 --> 28:29.840
I didn't ask.

28:33.011 --> 28:34.912
He knows.

28:34.914 --> 28:36.213
I don't know anything.

28:36.215 --> 28:37.715
And I don't care.

28:37.717 --> 28:39.416
I don't care how
kings become kings.

28:39.418 --> 28:41.051
I hated your father, too.

28:41.053 --> 28:42.986
(grunting)

28:44.189 --> 28:46.323
(sighs)

29:01.139 --> 29:04.174
Guards, what's happening?
What's wrong?

29:04.176 --> 29:06.210
An intruder was seen
outside the portcullis.

29:06.212 --> 29:07.945
We're just checking
on your majesty.

29:10.115 --> 29:12.416
(mary gasps, screams)

29:12.418 --> 29:14.885
Call for help, and I will slit
your catholic throat.

29:14.887 --> 29:17.821
Do you understand?

29:17.823 --> 29:19.223
Your guards are dead.

29:19.225 --> 29:21.358
Where is your husband?

29:21.360 --> 29:23.227
I don't know where he is.

29:23.229 --> 29:25.963
And few places
he spends his evenings.

29:25.965 --> 29:27.965
Don't scream, and if he walks
through the door,

29:27.967 --> 29:30.434
You might just live long enough
to watch him die.

29:31.803 --> 29:34.171
Another dead for my crimes.

29:34.173 --> 29:36.240
Stop blaming yourself and
take back what's yours--

29:36.242 --> 29:38.242
Your country.

29:38.244 --> 29:40.010
Mary...

29:40.012 --> 29:41.812
You can tell her
the truth now.

29:41.814 --> 29:43.380
Narcisse has nothing
on either of you.

29:43.382 --> 29:45.015
Nothing he can prove,
not anymore.

29:45.017 --> 29:47.985
I'll stay here and
clean this mess up.

29:47.987 --> 29:50.387
Go home to your wife,
and then kill narcisse.

29:50.389 --> 29:52.990
Run him through for
treason against his king.

29:57.929 --> 29:59.296
It's taking too long.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.031
Your men may have been caught.

30:01.033 --> 30:03.167
They could be coming for you,
right now, without warning.

30:03.169 --> 30:06.436
Shut up.
If you have as many men
as you say you do,

30:06.438 --> 30:08.505
The halls should be filled
with the sounds of battle.

30:08.507 --> 30:10.474
It's the dead of night.
All your guards see is

30:10.476 --> 30:12.876
Their own coming until they're
cut down. They'll find him.

30:12.878 --> 30:16.313
Francis isn't here.
He visits his bastard son
late at night, we know that.

30:16.315 --> 30:17.981
He isn't here.

30:17.983 --> 30:19.483
Your mission has failed,

30:19.485 --> 30:21.318
And you will die.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.853
If you leave now,

30:22.855 --> 30:24.188
Even if you
are caught,

30:24.190 --> 30:25.589
I will spare your lives.

30:27.392 --> 30:30.060
One of the grooms swore the king
left the castle earlier.

30:30.062 --> 30:32.296
He could be lying.

30:32.298 --> 30:34.031
I'm telling you,
we've looked as long as we dare.

30:34.033 --> 30:35.399
Burrell's been killed,

30:35.401 --> 30:37.067
One of the king's guards
may have survived.

30:37.069 --> 30:39.069
We are leaving <i>now.</i>

30:39.071 --> 30:41.338
We killed all the
other witnesses.

30:41.340 --> 30:42.906
Kill her before she can scream.

30:42.908 --> 30:44.875
(gasps quietly)
I'll do it.

30:47.912 --> 30:50.881
Don't-- no wrong that we have
committed against your people

30:50.883 --> 30:52.349
Will be remedied this night.

30:52.351 --> 30:54.384
(mary groans)

30:54.386 --> 30:56.520
Don't speak to me of wrongs
done-- you murdered my son,

30:56.522 --> 30:58.355
You and your husband.

30:58.357 --> 31:01.191
Hung him upside down on a cross,
like something evil,

31:01.193 --> 31:04.394
And he, my boy, a man of god.

31:04.396 --> 31:06.897
Your son was the minister.

31:10.468 --> 31:12.870
Severin...?

31:15.540 --> 31:17.507
Severin.

31:17.509 --> 31:18.475
She's a queen.

31:18.477 --> 31:20.244
Aye, she doesn't look like

31:20.246 --> 31:21.478
A queen now, does she?

31:25.583 --> 31:27.618
(mary grunting)

31:27.620 --> 31:29.286
You took my son,

31:29.288 --> 31:31.455
You destroyed my family,
you destroyed me.

31:31.457 --> 31:32.656
He said he had a bomb.

31:32.658 --> 31:34.958
It was your people
who killed him.

31:34.960 --> 31:38.128
Gerard, no!
(mary screams)

31:38.130 --> 31:41.265
Desecrated him
in the town square.
(muffled screaming)

31:41.267 --> 31:43.267
You shall know desecration.

31:43.269 --> 31:45.402
You, who claim to
be anointed by god,

31:45.404 --> 31:47.938
You godless bitch.

31:47.940 --> 31:49.439
Hold her down,
hold her down!

31:49.441 --> 31:51.241
(screams, grunts)

31:52.176 --> 31:53.443
(gasps)

31:54.445 --> 31:56.113
(grunting)

31:56.115 --> 31:58.181
(slow, distorted grunt)

32:02.020 --> 32:04.588
(slow exhale)

32:07.558 --> 32:09.960
(gasps, coughs)
(bell tolling rapidly)

32:15.700 --> 32:18.001
(shouts in pain)

32:24.442 --> 32:27.277
(bell tolling)
guard: They're in
the north keep!

32:27.279 --> 32:28.679
Stop.

32:28.681 --> 32:30.681
Guard:
My god, it's the queen.

32:30.683 --> 32:32.616
Get back to your posts.

32:32.618 --> 32:33.617
(guards shouting in distance)

32:33.619 --> 32:35.052
The queen will be with me.

32:38.990 --> 32:41.491
Mary, where is francis?

32:41.493 --> 32:43.560
Do you know?

32:43.562 --> 32:45.996
Uh, they said that
he wasn't in the castle--

32:45.998 --> 32:47.531
That he wasn't
here at all--

32:47.533 --> 32:49.132
And when they realized
that they'd failed,

32:49.134 --> 32:51.635
That's when they...

32:53.304 --> 32:55.272
Oh, my dear child.

32:55.274 --> 32:57.507
No! Uh...

32:57.509 --> 32:59.142
No.

33:00.345 --> 33:02.512
What did they do to you?

33:04.248 --> 33:07.184
The protestants came looking
for francis.

33:07.186 --> 33:09.319
And they were
going to kill him.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.154
I fought them off--
I hit one of them in the head

33:11.156 --> 33:12.622
And the other one...

33:15.727 --> 33:18.562
I'm only going to ask
you this once,

33:18.564 --> 33:20.497
So we are both clear

33:20.499 --> 33:22.699
On what you've
endured this night.

33:22.701 --> 33:24.701
Were you raped?

33:31.743 --> 33:34.578
I know you don't want to be
touched, that's all right.

33:35.646 --> 33:37.547
But you're safe.

33:37.549 --> 33:39.716
I don't know how you managed
to escape, but you did.

33:39.718 --> 33:43.453
You are alive.
(sobbing)

33:43.455 --> 33:45.422
You will survive this.

33:45.424 --> 33:47.257
I know this...

33:47.259 --> 33:48.358
Because I survived.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.394
You know that, too.

33:50.396 --> 33:53.030
They tried to destroy you
by taking your pride

33:53.032 --> 33:55.532
And your strength, but those
things cannot be taken.

33:55.534 --> 33:56.600
Not from you.

33:56.602 --> 33:58.268
Not ever.

34:00.238 --> 34:02.639
We're going to change your
clothes, fix your hair,

34:02.641 --> 34:05.542
We are going to erase any mark
of their hands on you.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.611
Please, leave me be.
We are.

34:07.613 --> 34:09.279
We are going to do this for you

34:09.281 --> 34:10.680
And for francis

34:10.682 --> 34:13.450
And for scotland and for France.

34:13.452 --> 34:17.154
They tried to diminish
a king tonight

34:17.156 --> 34:20.557
By degrading a queen,
and they will <i>not</i> succeed.

34:20.559 --> 34:23.827
Because the world will never
know what they did to you.

34:23.829 --> 34:26.630
That's not possible.
It is, because
you will

34:26.632 --> 34:28.598
Walk out of here and you will
face your court as if this

34:28.600 --> 34:31.535
Never happened.
No, I can't. I can't.

34:31.537 --> 34:33.403
Yes, you can.

34:33.405 --> 34:34.671
You have to.

34:34.673 --> 34:36.173
Mary, your guards saw you.

34:36.175 --> 34:39.709
You must put to rest
any rumors, immediately.

34:39.711 --> 34:41.611
These next moments of your life
will either define you

34:41.613 --> 34:44.481
As a victim
or a powerful queen

34:44.483 --> 34:47.717
Untouched by a failed
assassination attempt.

34:47.719 --> 34:49.553
They will define

34:49.555 --> 34:52.089
Who you are
perceived to be.

34:52.091 --> 34:54.491
Your place in history.

34:54.493 --> 34:55.859
Do not let them win.

34:57.662 --> 34:59.796
Trust me.

34:59.798 --> 35:01.331
Trust me and let me help you.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.501
Trust that I can get
you through this,

35:04.503 --> 35:07.637
Because I swear to you
that I can.

35:17.415 --> 35:18.882
Jacob, you say?

35:18.884 --> 35:20.717
What could he want
in the middle of the night?

35:20.719 --> 35:22.752
Leave us.

35:22.754 --> 35:25.755
Aloysius,
lady castleroy,

35:25.757 --> 35:27.724
Something terrible
has happened.

35:27.726 --> 35:29.726
Assassins managed
to enter the castle.

35:29.728 --> 35:31.761
The king and queen
are safe, I'm told,

35:31.763 --> 35:33.363
But others were
killed--

35:33.365 --> 35:34.631
Guards, servants.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.333
Assassins.

35:36.335 --> 35:38.135
Protestant assassins?

35:38.137 --> 35:40.604
Yes.
Who else was hurt? Tell me.

35:40.606 --> 35:41.905
I don't know.

35:41.907 --> 35:43.673
The kingsguards
are pulling known

35:43.675 --> 35:45.642
And suspected protestants
from their beds.

35:45.644 --> 35:47.711
My wife and
children are safe,

35:47.713 --> 35:49.679
But we need
your help-- funds--

35:49.681 --> 35:50.647
To get away for a time.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.349
Did you do this?

35:52.351 --> 35:54.217
Are you planning
a revolution,

35:54.219 --> 35:56.353
For all your talk
of god and peace?

35:56.355 --> 35:59.923
No, I swear to you both,
it was some rogue faction.

35:59.925 --> 36:01.791
I knew nothing of it until
I was warned of the search

36:01.793 --> 36:04.694
For the guilty, but I will be
held accountable.

36:04.696 --> 36:07.230
I think you are accountable.
I've looked into

36:07.232 --> 36:08.798
A few things
since you were here.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.800
I hadn't heard
of any fighting in chambord,

36:10.802 --> 36:12.269
Because, as I learned,
there was none.

36:12.271 --> 36:15.238
There was no delay
of materials.

36:15.240 --> 36:18.708
The money I gave you was
never going to build a school.

36:18.710 --> 36:21.211
Is this true?

36:21.213 --> 36:22.913
Where did that money go?

36:22.915 --> 36:25.782
And all the other donations
I entrusted you with?

36:25.784 --> 36:27.651
The news you gave me
of delays,

36:27.653 --> 36:30.287
The fighting.
I had no choice.

36:30.289 --> 36:32.589
They threatened me,
my family.

36:32.591 --> 36:35.325
They said a school wasn't what
we needed, assassins were--

36:35.327 --> 36:37.861
The house of valois toppled,
a brutal reign ended.

36:37.863 --> 36:40.830
Jacob:
Who threatened you?
Was it le clerc?

36:40.832 --> 36:42.399
Fontaine?
That I can't say--
they'll kill me.

36:42.401 --> 36:43.867
Aloysius, no.

36:43.869 --> 36:45.302
Tell me we didn't

36:45.304 --> 36:47.771
Fund an assassination
on our king.

36:51.776 --> 36:53.710
Still no word from balfont?

36:53.712 --> 36:55.478
None yet, my lord.

36:55.480 --> 36:56.880
And where is the king?
At a secure location,

36:56.882 --> 36:58.582
The guards are saying.
They must have

36:58.584 --> 37:00.417
Moved him the second
the alarms sounded.

37:00.419 --> 37:02.586
They say it was protestants

37:02.588 --> 37:04.955
Wearing stolen uniforms
of the guards.

37:04.957 --> 37:06.690
Well, it seems they
killed anyone who saw them

37:06.692 --> 37:07.924
As they moved
through the castle.

37:09.493 --> 37:11.361
Well, at least the engagement

37:11.363 --> 37:12.796
Will surely be off.

37:12.798 --> 37:15.765
Things can remain...
As they were.

37:16.968 --> 37:18.868
Where did the protestants
get the nerve?

37:18.870 --> 37:20.904
Surely they know
they will all be targets now?

37:20.906 --> 37:23.273
Crushed with such force.

37:23.275 --> 37:25.675
Well, th-they were being
crushed anyway, weren't they?

37:25.677 --> 37:28.278
I suppose they thought
they had little to lose.

37:29.580 --> 37:31.648
(horn plays fanfare
in distance)

37:32.883 --> 37:35.986
â™ª take control of who you are

37:37.989 --> 37:39.756
â™ª stay the same

37:39.758 --> 37:42.926
â™ª don't let them change you

37:44.428 --> 37:46.963
â™ª take control of who you are

37:50.268 --> 37:53.903
â™ª 'cause ain't nobody
gonna save you â™ª

37:53.905 --> 37:56.640
My loyal subjects...

37:58.542 --> 38:02.279
I reassure you that your king

38:02.281 --> 38:05.915
And your queen remain untouched.

38:05.917 --> 38:09.286
(murmurs of relief)

38:09.288 --> 38:12.455
These murderous traitors

38:12.457 --> 38:15.692
Who invaded the castle tonight
have achieved nothing,

38:15.694 --> 38:19.562
Have altered nothing,

38:19.564 --> 38:22.732
And will die for nothing.

38:25.303 --> 38:28.905
â™ª take control of who you are.

38:33.577 --> 38:34.844
(knocking on door)

38:34.846 --> 38:36.546
Come in.

38:36.548 --> 38:37.814
I'm sorry, lady lola, but...

38:37.816 --> 38:39.582
Lord narcisse insisted

38:39.584 --> 38:41.918
That I ask if you would
speak to him.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.920
Uh, it's all right, thank you.

38:43.922 --> 38:45.989
(baby fusses)
shh.

38:50.761 --> 38:53.697
I wanted to see
how you were feeling.

38:53.699 --> 38:55.332
If you were all right.

38:55.334 --> 38:57.667
The protestants came,
just as you warned.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.336
I'm sure they would've
killed mary and francis,

38:59.338 --> 39:00.837
If they could have.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.906
Who knows where
they would've stopped.

39:04.041 --> 39:06.643
I take no pleasure
in being right.

39:06.645 --> 39:08.845
Especially as I may have been

39:08.847 --> 39:10.847
Wrong about other issues.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.349
What happened

39:12.351 --> 39:14.684
Tonight was reckless.

39:14.686 --> 39:15.952
It was the act
of a people

39:15.954 --> 39:19.756
Who feel that they have
nothing to lose.

39:19.758 --> 39:21.624
To rob people of hope

39:21.626 --> 39:23.526
Is a dangerous mistake,

39:23.528 --> 39:26.663
And I suspect
it may have been my doing.

39:27.832 --> 39:30.100
Through your pressure
on francis.

39:30.102 --> 39:32.102
I fear this nation is burning

39:32.104 --> 39:34.604
And I am the man
who lit the match.

39:34.606 --> 39:37.006
Oh, perhaps I overvalue

39:37.008 --> 39:39.676
My role in the matter.

39:39.678 --> 39:41.511
You control a king.

39:41.513 --> 39:42.979
I'd say you're being accurate.

39:42.981 --> 39:45.515
Yes.

39:45.517 --> 39:47.517
You betrayed me,

39:47.519 --> 39:51.955
You called me an enemy of
those you hold dear, and yet

39:51.957 --> 39:54.023
When there was danger tonight,

39:54.025 --> 39:56.092
My worry was for you.

39:58.496 --> 40:01.931
I think about you.

40:01.933 --> 40:04.000
I think about you still.

40:06.737 --> 40:08.571
I want to sleep
but I can't stop shaking.

40:08.573 --> 40:09.973
I'm so cold.

40:09.975 --> 40:12.041
It's the shock of
the night's events.

40:14.145 --> 40:16.413
(sighs with relief)
it's true.

40:16.415 --> 40:17.547
You're all right,

40:17.549 --> 40:19.549
Thank god.
Slowly.

40:20.851 --> 40:22.051
Just give her time and space,

40:22.053 --> 40:23.686
And all you need
to do is listen.

40:23.688 --> 40:25.021
Shall I go?

40:35.699 --> 40:38.501
They said... That the guards

40:38.503 --> 40:39.869
Outside our chambers
were killed,

40:39.871 --> 40:41.771
But the assassins
never made it in,

40:41.773 --> 40:43.139
That you were untouched.

40:44.842 --> 40:46.443
I lied.

40:46.445 --> 40:47.944
Catherine lied.

40:47.946 --> 40:50.814
So no one would know.

40:53.584 --> 40:55.151
I was raped.

40:59.790 --> 41:01.524
Please don't
come any closer.

41:01.526 --> 41:03.092
I can't bear it--
I can hardly

41:03.094 --> 41:05.528
Bear to have you to look at me.

41:05.530 --> 41:07.597
Mary...

41:07.599 --> 41:09.599
You are my life

41:09.601 --> 41:12.101
And I love you.

41:12.103 --> 41:13.970
And this is my fault.

41:13.972 --> 41:16.172
Because you weren't here?

41:16.174 --> 41:18.241
Because you were doing all

41:18.243 --> 41:20.610
You could to sway the
