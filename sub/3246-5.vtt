WEBVTT

00:10.636 --> 00:14.937
The prototype
has passed every test, sir. It's working.

00:15.599 --> 00:19.354
I hardly think "working"
is the correct word.

00:22.940 --> 00:26.319
That would apply only to machines.

00:26.485 --> 00:30.490
I'm sorry. I should say, "It's alive."

00:31.949 --> 00:35.044
- Can it hear me?
- It might still be in shock.

00:35.118 --> 00:38.839
Bear in mind the brain has been
welded to the exoskeleton.

00:38.956 --> 00:41.129
Skin of metal.

00:45.462 --> 00:49.387
And a body that will never age or die.

00:50.842 --> 00:54.221
I envy it. Do you know me?

00:55.013 --> 00:58.563
Answer. Do you know me?

00:59.476 --> 01:01.649
You are John Lumic.

01:04.105 --> 01:05.528
My child.

01:05.607 --> 01:10.738
Mark this day, Dr Kendrick. We are blessed.

01:10.821 --> 01:14.542
Well, it's not quite over yet, sir.
We need Geneva's approval.

01:14.616 --> 01:19.213
Technically, this is a new form of life,
and that contravenes the Bio-Convention.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.047
They'd need to ratify this.

01:21.123 --> 01:23.046
And they will refuse me.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.043
Nonetheless, we need to tell them.

01:25.127 --> 01:26.720
And if I don't?

01:26.795 --> 01:31.346
Well, I'm sorry, sir, but it's my duty.
I shall have to inform them.

01:31.425 --> 01:35.180
And how will you do that
from beyond the grave?

01:36.430 --> 01:38.524
I don't quite understand.

01:39.558 --> 01:40.901
Kill him.

01:50.861 --> 01:53.034
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

01:53.155 --> 01:57.877
Inform all staff we have a new destination.

01:58.994 --> 02:00.712
Set sail

02:00.787 --> 02:02.630
for Great Britain!

02:40.619 --> 02:43.042
And that weird munchkin lady
with the big eyes.

02:43.121 --> 02:44.714
You remember the way she looked at you?

02:44.790 --> 02:46.510
Then she opens her mouth
and fire comes out!

02:46.583 --> 02:48.051
I thought I was gonna get frazzled!

02:48.126 --> 02:51.426
Yeah, one minute she's standing there,
the next minute, roar!

02:52.589 --> 02:54.432
Where was that? What happened?

02:54.508 --> 02:57.478
Oh, it was on this... er, planet thing.

02:57.594 --> 03:00.689
Asteroid. It's a long story.
You had to be there.

03:00.764 --> 03:02.607
What are you doing that for?

03:02.683 --> 03:04.481
'Cause you told me to.

03:04.559 --> 03:06.106
When was that?

03:06.770 --> 03:08.647
About half an hour ago.

03:08.730 --> 03:12.109
Urn... You can let go now.

03:14.778 --> 03:17.452
Well, how long's it been
since I could've stopped?

03:17.531 --> 03:21.456
Ten minutes. Twenty. Twenty nine.

03:21.910 --> 03:25.164
- You just forgot me!
- No, no, no, I was just...

03:25.288 --> 03:28.087
I was calibrating.
I know exactly what I'm doing.

03:41.430 --> 03:44.274
- What's happened?
- The time vortex. It's gone.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.852
That's impossible. It's just gone!

03:48.645 --> 03:51.489
Brace yourselves! We're gonna crash!

03:58.071 --> 04:00.244
Everyone all right? Rose? Mickey?

04:00.323 --> 04:02.291
I'm fine, I'm okay, sorry, yeah.

04:06.788 --> 04:09.166
She's dead.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.711
The Tardis is dead.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.338
You can fix it.

04:15.422 --> 04:19.177
There's nothing to fix. She's perished.

04:22.471 --> 04:26.226
The last Tardis in the universe. Extinct.

04:28.018 --> 04:30.612
We can get help, yeah?

04:30.687 --> 04:32.610
Where from?

04:32.689 --> 04:35.033
Well, we've landed.
We've got to be somewhere.

04:35.192 --> 04:38.696
We fell out of the vortex,
through the void, into nothingness.

04:40.030 --> 04:43.079
We're in some sort of no place.

04:43.158 --> 04:47.334
The Silent Realm. The Lost Dimension.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.881
Otherwise known as London.

04:53.585 --> 04:56.714
London, England, Earth! Hold on...

05:00.091 --> 05:04.062
It's the 1st of February. This year.
Not exactly far ﬂung, is it?

05:04.137 --> 05:06.185
- So this is London?
- Yup.

05:06.264 --> 05:07.982
- Your city?
- That's the one.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.152
- Just as we left it?
- Bang on.

05:10.227 --> 05:12.776
And that includes the zeppelins?

05:15.524 --> 05:17.242
What the hell?

05:17.317 --> 05:19.240
That's beautiful.

05:20.362 --> 05:23.616
Okay, so it's London
with a big International Zeppelin Festival.

05:23.698 --> 05:25.700
This is not your world.

05:25.784 --> 05:30.415
But if the date's the same...
It's parallel, right?

05:30.747 --> 05:33.170
Am I right? Like a parallel Earth
only they've got zeppelins?

05:33.250 --> 05:35.628
- Am I right? I'm right, aren't I?
- Must be.

05:35.710 --> 05:38.930
- A parallel world where...
- Come on, you've seen it on films.

05:39.005 --> 05:42.680
Like an alternative to our world where
everything's the same but a little different.

05:42.759 --> 05:46.434
Like, I don't know, traffic lights are
blue, Tony Blair never got elected...

05:46.513 --> 05:48.766
And he's still alive.

05:50.684 --> 05:54.063
A parallel world where
my dad's still alive.

05:55.355 --> 05:59.155
Don't look at it, Rose. Don't even
think about it. This is not your world.

05:59.276 --> 06:01.529
He's my dad. And...

06:02.445 --> 06:04.447
Trust me on this.

06:05.282 --> 06:08.536
Oh, that's weird. But he's real...

06:08.618 --> 06:11.371
- Trust me on this.
- He's a success.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.832
He was always planning
these daft little schemes,

06:13.957 --> 06:17.131
health food drinks and stuff.
Everyone said they were useless.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.302
But he did it.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.881
Rose, if you ever trusted me,
then listen to me now.

06:20.964 --> 06:24.138
Stop looking at him. Your father's dead.

06:24.301 --> 06:28.807
He died when you were six months old.
That is not your Pete. That is a Pete.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.233
For all we know he's got his own Jackie.
His own Rose.

06:31.308 --> 06:35.563
His own daughter who is someone else,
but not you. You can't see him.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.488
Not ever.

06:38.106 --> 06:42.703
Trust me on this. Trust me on this.
Trust me on this. Trust me on this.

07:11.139 --> 07:15.315
Hello? Sweetheart? Only me.

07:16.728 --> 07:19.527
Oh, the bad penny. Was this your idea?

07:19.648 --> 07:22.618
Don't deny it.
It's got your fingerprints all over it.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.114
"Trust me on this."

07:24.194 --> 07:26.572
Oh, I can trust you all right.
Trust you to cock it up.

07:26.655 --> 07:29.078
- What have I done now?
- Have a look.

07:37.916 --> 07:41.671
- What's wrong with that?
- 40! It says 40.

07:41.753 --> 07:45.303
- You are 40.
- I don't want the whole world telling, do I?

07:45.382 --> 07:48.431
- You're having a party tonight!
- My 39th!

07:48.510 --> 07:52.481
My official biography says I was born
on the same day as Cuba Gooding, jr.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.770
And that makes me 39,
thank you very much.

07:54.891 --> 07:57.895
Rose. Come here. Rose.

08:00.230 --> 08:03.234
These are from the girls in the office.
Happy birthday.

08:05.068 --> 08:08.368
I've got hand sculpted arrangements by
Veronica of Reykjavik

08:08.446 --> 08:11.950
and your secretary stopped off at a garage.
I don't think so.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.331
And if you're giving out presents,
where's my zeppelin?

08:14.411 --> 08:17.961
Everyone else has got one.
Rose! Come on, Rose!

08:18.748 --> 08:23.345
Bet you didn't even notice, did you?
Special delivery. Got sent round today.

08:23.461 --> 08:26.590
Birthday present from Mr Lumic,
latest model.

08:26.673 --> 08:30.268
Diamond studded.
Pick up signals from Venezuela.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.846
Why would you want to pick up signals
from Venezuela?

08:32.929 --> 08:38.186
Well, I don't know, but now I can find out!
For God's sake, where is she? Rose!

08:38.268 --> 08:41.317
She needs a good bath before tonight
or she's gonna be honking. Rose!

08:41.395 --> 08:43.649
Come to mummy, come on!

08:43.732 --> 08:45.985
There you are, my darling.

08:48.903 --> 08:50.621
Mr Lumic!

08:50.697 --> 08:53.371
Jackie was just saying thank you.
That's very kind of you.

08:53.450 --> 08:57.455
Those Ear Pods are handmade.
Tell her to take care.

08:57.829 --> 08:59.456
Course I will. Course I will.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.793
I don't suppose you'll be joining
us tonight, for the party?

09:02.876 --> 09:04.594
We'd be very honoured.

09:04.669 --> 09:08.390
The world below can party.
Some of us have work to do.

09:08.465 --> 09:12.936
My plans have advanced, Peter.
The President has promised a decision.

09:13.011 --> 09:16.732
I'm flying in now.
We will be at the airstrip by 5:00.

09:16.806 --> 09:21.778
Right. It's just that I promised
I'd help the wife out tonight.

09:21.895 --> 09:25.945
If the President of Great Britain
can make this meeting, then so can you.

09:26.024 --> 09:27.617
He's not married to Jackie, is he?

09:27.692 --> 09:31.447
5:00, Mr Tyler. A famous day!

09:36.034 --> 09:38.787
Voice print access, john Lumic.

09:39.245 --> 09:42.044
Initiate Ear Pod override.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.511
Subject: Jacqueline Tyler.

09:50.006 --> 09:51.383
Activate.

09:52.634 --> 09:58.061
Download. Tyler residence.
February the 7st.

09:58.640 --> 10:04.568
Give me security arrangements for
tonight, passwords, encryption services.

10:14.364 --> 10:15.991
And restore.

10:23.206 --> 10:25.208
Thank you, Mrs Tyler.

10:27.001 --> 10:29.220
Activate picturelink.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.177
Mr Crane.

10:32.257 --> 10:34.055
Mr Lumic.

10:34.134 --> 10:37.764
Events are moving faster
than I anticipated.

10:37.846 --> 10:40.224
I need extra staff.

10:40.431 --> 10:43.355
Very good, sir.
I shall go on a recruitment drive.

10:44.894 --> 10:46.396
Back her up.

10:57.115 --> 10:59.868
- I told you to keep an eye on her.
- She's all right.

10:59.951 --> 11:01.828
She goes wandering off...

11:01.911 --> 11:04.255
A parallel world,
it's like a gingerbread house.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.340
All those temptations calling her.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.839
So it's just Rose, then?
Nothing out there to tempt me?

11:08.918 --> 11:10.918
Well, I don't know.
I can't worry about everything!

11:10.962 --> 11:13.932
If I could just get this thing to...

11:14.048 --> 11:15.721
- Did that help?
- Yes.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.144
- Did that hurt?
- Yes. Ow.

11:57.175 --> 11:59.303
And it? good news for Great Britain

11:59.385 --> 12:01.854
as John Lumic returns
to the country of his birth.

12:01.930 --> 12:04.649
Mr Lumic, the inventor of
High Content metal,

12:04.724 --> 12:07.318
has denied allegations of ill health.

12:07.393 --> 12:12.445
We're all flesh and blood,
but the brain is what makes us human.

12:13.107 --> 12:16.407
And my mind is more creative than ever.

12:16.486 --> 12:19.330
With shares in Cybus Industries
doubling in price,

12:19.405 --> 12:23.751
Mr Lumic has pledged more support
for the homeless in New South America.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.203
[n other news.

12:25.286 --> 12:29.291
The Torchwood Institute has published
a study claiming that...

12:30.124 --> 12:32.547
We're not meant to be here.

12:33.002 --> 12:36.927
The Tardis draws its power from
the universe but it's the wrong universe.

12:37.006 --> 12:39.555
It's like diesel in a petrol engine.

12:40.551 --> 12:43.100
But I've seen it in comics,
people go hopping

12:43.179 --> 12:46.058
from one alternative world to another.
It's easy!

12:46.182 --> 12:48.105
Not in the real world.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.816
Used to be easy.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.815
When the Time Lords
kept their eye on everything,

12:52.855 --> 12:55.825
you could pop between realities,
home in time for tea.

12:56.526 --> 12:59.370
Then they died and took it all with them.

13:00.655 --> 13:03.875
The walls of reality closed.
The worlds were sealed.

13:04.534 --> 13:07.253
Everything became that bit less kind.

13:07.787 --> 13:11.883
- Then how did we get here?
- I don't know. Accident.

13:13.459 --> 13:16.303
Should've been impossible,
now we're trapped.

13:19.924 --> 13:21.221
What's that?

13:22.260 --> 13:23.352
What?

13:23.428 --> 13:25.897
That there. Is that a reflection?

13:29.225 --> 13:33.901
It's a light! Is it? Is that a light?
I think that's a light.

13:33.980 --> 13:38.577
That's all we need. We've got power!
Mickey, we've got power!

13:46.826 --> 13:51.206
Gentlemen, gentlemen!
I beg your attention!

13:51.289 --> 13:54.634
Christmas has come early
so come and get it!

13:55.877 --> 13:58.551
Oh, smell that, comrades!

13:58.629 --> 14:01.473
Burgers and chips! Sausage and beans!

14:01.549 --> 14:06.020
Pork, chicken and hot sweet tea.
All for free!

14:06.095 --> 14:08.393
- Don't go!
- But there's food.

14:08.473 --> 14:10.441
All you can eat, free of charge!

14:10.516 --> 14:14.316
Don't just stand there.
Fill your faces with pasties...

14:14.395 --> 14:15.521
They're lying-

14:15.605 --> 14:18.609
It's easy for you to say.
When did you last starve?

14:18.733 --> 14:21.452
All those people
disappearing off the streets.

14:21.527 --> 14:25.623
It's been going on for months. It's them.

14:25.740 --> 14:28.869
- They' re taking you away.
- What for?

14:28.993 --> 14:30.666
Experiments.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.548
I'm so hungry.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.293
So come and get it while it's hot!

14:37.418 --> 14:41.548
That's it, kind sir,
get in there and fill your face!

14:41.631 --> 14:44.350
Feast yourself, brother, feast yourself.

14:45.802 --> 14:48.100
- What are you doing!
- Take them away.

14:48.179 --> 14:50.227
No! No! Help!

14:52.975 --> 14:54.818
It's alive!

14:55.686 --> 14:57.188
- What is it?
- Nothing.

14:57.313 --> 15:00.283
It's tiny. It's one of those
insignificant little power cells

15:00.358 --> 15:03.111
that no one ever bothers about
and it's clinging on to life!

15:03.236 --> 15:05.910
It's got one little ounce of reality,
tucked away inside.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.581
Enough to get us home?

15:07.657 --> 15:09.159
Not yet.

15:10.159 --> 15:12.332
I need to charge it up.

15:13.329 --> 15:15.423
We could go outside
and lash it up to the national grid.

15:15.498 --> 15:18.251
Wrong sort of energy.
It's got to come from our universe.

15:18.334 --> 15:19.961
But we don't have anything.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.512
There's me.

15:29.887 --> 15:34.313
I just gave away 10 years of my life.
Worth every second.

15:45.236 --> 15:46.909
It's going out. Is that okay?

15:47.029 --> 15:50.533
It's on a recharging cycle.
It'll loop round, power back up

15:50.658 --> 15:54.379
and be ready to take us home in 24 hours.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.461
So that gives us 24 hours
on a parallel world?

15:57.540 --> 15:58.792
Shore leave.

15:58.875 --> 16:02.755
So long as we keep our heads down,
easy, no problem. Let's go and tell her.

16:03.379 --> 16:07.384
There you are!
It's all right, no applause, I fixed it.

16:08.050 --> 16:11.054
24 hours
and then we're ﬂying back to reality.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.058
What is it?

16:16.267 --> 16:21.444
My phone connected. There's this
Cybus network. It finds your phone.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.202
It gave me internet access.

16:26.319 --> 16:29.619
Rose, whatever it says,
this is the wrong world.

16:30.698 --> 16:33.668
- I don't exist.
- What do you mean?

16:33.743 --> 16:36.462
There's no Rose Tyler. I was never born.

16:36.579 --> 16:38.877
There's Pete, my dad, and Jackie.

16:38.956 --> 16:42.085
He still married Mum
but they never had kids.

16:42.210 --> 16:43.632
Give me that phone.

16:44.587 --> 16:50.094
They're rich. They've got a house
and cars and everything they want.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.480
But they haven't got me.

17:00.603 --> 17:02.697
- I've got to see them.
- You can't.

17:02.772 --> 17:05.025
- I just want to see them.
- I can't let you.

17:05.107 --> 17:08.452
- You just said 24 hours.
- You can't become their daughter.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.576
That's not the way it works.
Mickey, tell her.

17:10.655 --> 17:12.202
24 hours, yeah?

17:12.281 --> 17:14.659
- Where are you going?
- Well, I can do what I want.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.377
I've got the address and everything.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.750
Stay where you are! Both of you!
Rose, come back!

17:18.829 --> 17:21.958
- Mickey, come back here! Right now!
- I just want to see them.

17:22.083 --> 17:24.757
- Yeah, I've got things to see and all.
- Like what?

17:24.835 --> 17:27.884
You don't know anything
about me, do you? It's always about Rose.

17:27.964 --> 17:30.058
I'm just a spare part.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.385
I'm sorry, I've got to go.

17:34.470 --> 17:37.223
Go on, then. There's no choice, is there?

17:37.306 --> 17:41.311
You can only chase after one of us
and it's never gonna be me, is it?

17:44.146 --> 17:46.444
Back here. 24 hours.

17:47.316 --> 17:50.445
Yeah. If I haven't found something better.

18:12.466 --> 18:15.640
Mr Tyler, what's the matter
couldn't wait until tonight?

18:15.720 --> 18:19.224
Mr President. Honoured.
I'm on the fast-track programme.

18:19.307 --> 18:22.561
Cybus Industries have bought up
my company so I'm part of the firm now.

18:22.643 --> 18:25.271
Some people say
they've bought my government.

18:25.354 --> 18:28.233
I've never heard anybody say that. Never.

18:29.567 --> 18:31.194
You can trust me on this.

18:31.277 --> 18:35.828
I tried your drink, that Vitex stuff.
It tastes like pop.

18:36.157 --> 18:37.534
Well, it is pop.

18:37.658 --> 18:41.208
You've made money by selling
a health food drink to a sick world.

18:41.287 --> 18:44.917
Not quite the ordinary Joe
you appear to be, are you?

18:46.292 --> 18:50.047
He does like to keep us waiting.

18:51.881 --> 18:56.728
But tell me, you've had a chance
to observe John Lumic more than most.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.263
What's your opinion?

19:00.181 --> 19:03.401
He's very sharp, I'd say, sharp as ever.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.487
Very clever man. Brilliant, in fact.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.815
Then you don't think he's insane?

19:08.898 --> 19:11.276
It's not the word I would've used, no.

19:11.776 --> 19:12.993
I see.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.553
- Am I all right to go past?
- Yeah.

19:38.636 --> 19:41.936
No bother. Curfew doesn't start till 10:00.

19:42.098 --> 19:44.396
- There's a curfew?
- Course there is.

19:44.475 --> 19:47.979
Where you been living, mate?
Up there with the toffs?

19:51.273 --> 19:52.650
I wish.

19:55.277 --> 19:56.779
See you.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.841
Mickey's mum just couldn't cope.

20:10.876 --> 20:14.631
His dad hung around for a while,
but then he just sort of wandered off.

20:14.714 --> 20:20.221
He was brought up by his gran.
She was such a great woman.

20:20.302 --> 20:23.431
God, she used to slap him!

20:24.056 --> 20:27.651
But then she died.
She tripped and fell down the stairs.

20:28.436 --> 20:31.610
It was about five years ago now.
I was still in school.

20:32.273 --> 20:33.650
I never knew.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.986
- Well, you never asked.
- You never said.

20:36.068 --> 20:39.447
That's Mickey. I suppose...

20:39.530 --> 20:42.409
we just take him for granted.

20:43.826 --> 20:47.000
- Do you think she's still alive? His gran?
- Could be.

20:47.121 --> 20:49.795
Like I said, parallel world,
gingerbread house.

20:49.874 --> 20:52.297
We need to get out of here
as fast as we can.

20:59.884 --> 21:02.057
What are they all doing?

21:02.136 --> 21:04.013
They've stopped.

21:21.405 --> 21:23.703
It's the ear pieces.

21:25.659 --> 21:29.334
Like Bluetooth attachments
but everyone's connected together.

21:32.166 --> 21:36.046
It's on my phone. It's automatic.
Look, it's downloading.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.631
Is this what they're all getting?

21:40.883 --> 21:45.354
News, international news,
sport, weather.

21:45.805 --> 21:50.231
They get it direct.
Downloaded right into their heads.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.529
TV schedules, lottery numbers.

21:53.687 --> 21:56.406
Everyone shares the same information.

21:57.233 --> 22:00.863
Daily download,
published by Cybus Industries.

22:10.246 --> 22:12.999
You lot, you're obsessed.
You'll do anything for the latest upgrade.

22:13.082 --> 22:16.177
Oi, they're not my lot.
Different world, remember?

22:16.252 --> 22:19.347
It's not so far off your world.
This place is only parallel.

22:19.421 --> 22:21.298
Oh, look at that.

22:21.382 --> 22:26.354
Cybus Industries, owners of just about
every company in Britain, including Vitex.

22:26.428 --> 22:29.477
Mr Pete Tyler's very well connected.

22:36.105 --> 22:38.779
Okay, I give up. Let's go and see him.

22:56.292 --> 22:58.340
Who's that there?

23:01.672 --> 23:04.596
Who is it? I know you're there.

23:04.675 --> 23:08.396
Shame on you, tricking an old lady.
I've got nothing worth stealing.

23:08.470 --> 23:12.441
And don't think I'm gonna disappear.
You're not gonna take me!

23:12.516 --> 23:13.642
Hi.

23:16.854 --> 23:18.982
Is that you?

23:19.064 --> 23:21.032
It's me. I came home.

23:21.150 --> 23:22.493
Ricky!

23:22.651 --> 23:24.153
It's Mickey.

23:24.278 --> 23:28.954
I know my own grandson's name.
It's Ricky. Now come here.

23:32.745 --> 23:37.091
Okay, I'm Ricky. Of course I am.
Ricky, that's me.

23:38.125 --> 23:40.127
- You stupid boy!
- Ow!

23:40.210 --> 23:42.258
- Where've you been?
- Stop hitting me!

23:42.338 --> 23:44.386
It's been days and days.

23:44.465 --> 23:48.015
I keep hearing all these stories,
people disappearing off the street.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.767
There's nothing official on the download

23:50.846 --> 23:53.975
but there are all these rumours
and whispers.

23:54.058 --> 23:57.312
I thought they'd gone and disappeared you.

23:57.394 --> 24:00.694
That carpet on the stairs,
I told you to get it fixed. You're gonna...

24:00.814 --> 24:02.282
fall and break your neck.

24:02.358 --> 24:04.281
Well, you get it fixed for me!

24:04.360 --> 24:07.580
I should've done it way back.
I guess I'm just kind of useless.

24:07.655 --> 24:10.158
Now, I never said that.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.163
I am, though.

24:12.242 --> 24:14.415
And I'm sorry, Gran. I'm so sorry.

24:14.495 --> 24:18.125
Don't talk like that.
Do you know what you need?

24:18.874 --> 24:21.718
A nice sit down and a cup of tea.

24:22.378 --> 24:25.757
- You got time?
- For you, I've got all the time in the world.

24:25.839 --> 24:29.059
Oh, you say that but it's all talk.

24:30.260 --> 24:34.015
It's those new friends of yours.
I don't trust them.

24:34.098 --> 24:36.977
- What friends are they?
- Don't pretend you don't know.

24:37.059 --> 24:39.687
You've been seen. Mrs Chan told me.

24:39.770 --> 24:42.569
Driving about,
all helter-skelter, in that van.

24:42.648 --> 24:44.491
What Van's that, then?

24:44.566 --> 24:47.035
You know full well.
Don't play games with me.

24:48.737 --> 24:50.614
Get inside.

24:53.742 --> 24:56.291
I've been looking for you everywhere!

25:00.874 --> 25:02.876
Ricky. Ricky!

25:03.085 --> 25:04.962
Ricky, you were the one who told us.

25:05.045 --> 25:07.673
You don't contact your family
'cause it puts them in danger.

25:07.756 --> 25:10.930
Yeah. Ricky said that.
Course I did. just testing.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.138
I saw them. I taped them.

25:13.220 --> 25:16.724
They went round Blackfriars gathering up
the homeless like the Child Catcher.

25:16.807 --> 25:18.525
They must have took four dozen.

25:18.600 --> 25:23.231
The vans were hired out to a company
called International Electromatics.

25:23.772 --> 25:25.365
But I did a protocol search,

25:25.441 --> 25:28.945
turns out that's a dummy company
established by guess who?

25:29.611 --> 25:30.863
I don't know. Who?

25:30.946 --> 25:33.199
Cybus Industries!

25:33.282 --> 25:34.955
Well, now we've got evidence!

25:35.034 --> 25:37.662
Bad news is they've arrested Thin Jimmy.

25:37.745 --> 25:40.840
- So that just leaves you.
- Leaves me what?

25:40.914 --> 25:42.587
The number one.

25:42.666 --> 25:44.168
Top of the list.

25:44.251 --> 25:46.299
London's most wanted.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.301
Okay. Cool.

25:49.381 --> 25:50.974
Say that again.

25:51.425 --> 25:54.053
The most precious thing
on this earth is the human brain

25:54.136 --> 25:55.809
and yet we allow it to die.

25:55.888 --> 25:59.267
But now Cybus Industries
has perfected a way

25:59.349 --> 26:04.571
of sustaining the brain indefinitely
within a cradle of copyrighted chemicals.

26:04.980 --> 26:08.154
And the latest advances
in synapse research

26:08.233 --> 26:13.364
allows cyberkinetic impulses
to be bonded onto a metal exoskeleton.

26:13.655 --> 26:15.908
This is the ultimate upgrade.

26:15.991 --> 26:19.086
Our greatest step into cyberspace.

26:19.161 --> 26:22.165
I'm sorry, could we stop it there?

26:22.956 --> 26:27.678
I don't need the pitch. I think we all know
what this ultimate upgrade entails.

26:28.295 --> 26:30.172
And I'm here to tell you, John,

26:30.255 --> 26:32.007
the answer is no.

26:32.841 --> 26:35.435
My government
does not give you permission.

26:36.678 --> 26:39.056
And I think no government ever will.

26:39.223 --> 26:42.022
I've prepared a paper
for the Ethical Committee.

26:42.101 --> 26:43.569
Oh, come on!

26:43.644 --> 26:46.693
It's not just unethical, it's obscene.

26:46.772 --> 26:50.777
Mr President,
if I might make a personal plea.

26:51.026 --> 26:52.653
I am dying, sir.

26:52.736 --> 26:54.704
I'm aware of that.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.498
And I'm very sorry.

26:56.573 --> 26:59.452
Without this project,
you have condemned me.

27:00.202 --> 27:03.752
My inventions have advanced
this whole planet.

27:05.040 --> 27:07.042
Would you have all that perish?

27:07.126 --> 27:09.800
You're a fine businessman, John.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.721
But you're not God.

27:13.757 --> 27:17.637
I'm really very sorry
but I think we should end it there.

27:18.720 --> 27:21.473
Mr Tyler, I'll see you tonight.

27:21.807 --> 27:24.560
I think we could all do with a drink.

27:25.310 --> 27:26.607
Mr Lumic.

27:36.446 --> 27:40.167
Still, it's not the only country
in the world. There's always New Germany.

27:40.242 --> 27:42.085
This is the homeland.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.879
My birthplace.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.043
You may leave.

27:46.123 --> 27:47.841
Thank you, sir.

27:53.213 --> 27:54.715
Mr Crane!

27:55.340 --> 27:56.842
Ready and waiting, sir.

27:56.925 --> 27:59.019
Did the override work?

27:59.094 --> 28:02.974
Well, it needs a biz' of fine tuning.
We weren't exactly delicate given the rush.

28:03.098 --> 28:05.817
But, yeah, yeah, it's all working.

28:06.894 --> 28:09.147
I've been testing the system, sir.

28:12.608 --> 28:15.612
They've grafted on a treat, these have.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.446
Given a little persuasion.

28:17.571 --> 28:19.824
If you'd care to observe, sir.

28:22.826 --> 28:26.000
And turn to the right.

28:27.956 --> 28:30.630
And back to the left.

28:31.293 --> 28:33.671
Are you having fun, Mr Crane?

28:33.795 --> 28:38.175
No, no, not at all, sir, no.
It's just... Well, it's irresistible.

28:38.300 --> 28:41.474
Then resist and start the upgrade.

28:41.929 --> 28:43.181
Did we get permission?

28:43.305 --> 28:46.479
I am governed by greater law; old friend.

28:46.558 --> 28:49.937
The right of a man to survive. Now begin!

28:52.898 --> 28:55.367
And turn to the left.

28:57.110 --> 28:58.703
Forward march.

29:04.993 --> 29:09.874
Whoa! Let's cover up that noise.
Give us track number 19.

29:49.746 --> 29:52.124
There's a light on.
There's someone inside the base.

29:52.207 --> 29:54.209
Mrs Moore, we've got visitors.

29:59.840 --> 30:03.435
One, two, three, go!

30:05.387 --> 30:07.355
What the hell are you doing?

30:08.515 --> 30:10.233
What are you doing there?

30:10.976 --> 30:12.569
What am I doing here?

30:15.105 --> 30:16.732
What am I doing there?

30:24.906 --> 30:27.250
They've got visitors.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.545
February the 1st. Mum's birthday.

30:31.079 --> 30:34.174
Even in a parallel universe,
she still loves a party.

30:34.249 --> 30:37.469
Well, given Pete Tyler's guest list,
I wouldn't mind a look.

30:37.586 --> 30:40.009
And there is one guaranteed way
of getting inside...

30:40.088 --> 30:41.681
Psychic pa Per-

30:41.757 --> 30:43.680
Who do you want to be?

30:56.438 --> 30:59.362
- We could've been anyone.
- It got us in, didn't it?

30:59.441 --> 31:02.536
You're in charge of the psychic paper.
We could've been guests.

31:02.652 --> 31:05.451
Celebrities. Sir Doctor, Dame Rose.

31:05.572 --> 31:08.792
And we end up serving.
I did enough of this back home.

31:09.868 --> 31:12.792
If you want to know what's going on,
work in the kitchen.

31:17.334 --> 31:20.964
- According to Lucy, that man over there...
- Who's Lucy?

31:21.671 --> 31:24.265
She's carrying the salmon pinwheels.

31:24.341 --> 31:27.311
- Oh, that's Lucy, is it?
- Yeah.

31:27.427 --> 31:30.647
Lucy says
that is the President of Great Britain.

31:30.764 --> 31:32.482
What, there's a president,
not a prime minister?

31:32.557 --> 31:34.230
Seems so.

31:34.309 --> 31:37.483
Or maybe Lucy's just a bit thick.

31:43.652 --> 31:46.405
Excuse me, thank you very much.

31:46.488 --> 31:49.537
Thank you,
if I could have your attention please.

31:49.658 --> 31:52.787
- Come on, Pete.
- Thank you very much.

31:55.497 --> 31:59.798
I'd just like to say thank you to you all
for coming

31:59.918 --> 32:01.841
on this very special occasion.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.342
My wife's...

32:03.422 --> 32:04.674
39th.

32:06.967 --> 32:09.265
Trust me on this.

32:09.344 --> 32:12.223
And so without any further
ado, here she is,

32:12.347 --> 32:15.692
the birthday girl, my lovely wife,

32:16.476 --> 32:17.648
Jackie Tyler.

32:26.403 --> 32:28.531
Now, I'm not giving a speech,

32:28.655 --> 32:31.750
that's what my parties are famous for,
no work, no politics.

32:31.867 --> 32:35.167
Just a few good mates
and plenty of black market whisky.

32:37.164 --> 32:39.508
Pardon me, Mr President.

32:39.583 --> 32:42.883
So, yeah, get on with it. Enjoy! Enjoy.

32:48.842 --> 32:51.470
You can't stay. Even if there was
some way of telling them.

32:51.553 --> 32:53.271
Course I can't.

32:53.346 --> 32:56.976
I've still got Mum at home, my real mum.
I couldn't just leave her, could I?

32:57.058 --> 32:58.651
It's just...

33:00.353 --> 33:01.946
They've got each other.

33:03.398 --> 33:04.695
Mum's got no one.

33:04.774 --> 33:07.277
She's got you. Those two haven't.

33:09.029 --> 33:11.498
All these different worlds,
not one of them gets it right.

33:11.573 --> 33:13.246
Rose!

33:13.325 --> 33:17.080
Here's my little girl!
Come to mummy, come to mummy, yes.

33:18.788 --> 33:20.836
Good girl, aren't you!

33:26.880 --> 33:28.348
Sorry.

33:32.093 --> 33:35.267
Platoon 02 now boarding.

33:35.388 --> 33:38.608
Platoon 02 now boarding.

33:41.311 --> 33:43.188
Stop staring.

33:43.271 --> 33:46.946
- But what are they, sir?
- I'm told they're the future.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.153
Ain't technology wonderful?

33:49.277 --> 33:51.905
Go on, get to the cab, start her up.

33:51.988 --> 33:53.410
Sir.

33:56.201 --> 33:58.920
Mr Crane, are we mobile?

33:58.995 --> 34:01.874
Just about to hit the road, sir.
And yourself?

34:02.082 --> 34:05.677
I'm arriving, Mr Crane.
Prepare the factory.

34:07.671 --> 34:12.141
Now send them forth, old friend.
Let the good work begin.

34:27.899 --> 34:30.027
He's clean. No bugs.

34:30.150 --> 34:31.902
But this is off the scale.

34:33.487 --> 34:35.581
He's flesh and blood. How did that happen?

34:35.657 --> 34:38.752
Well, it could be that Cybus Industries

34:38.827 --> 34:41.876
have perfected the science
of human cloning.

34:41.996 --> 34:44.045
Or, your father had a bike.

34:48.503 --> 34:50.926
And your name's Mickey, not Ricky?

34:51.005 --> 34:52.382
Mickey.

34:52.465 --> 34:56.094
Dad was Jackson Smith, used to work
at the key cutter's on Clifton Parade.

34:56.177 --> 34:58.521
Went to Spain, never came back.

35:00.265 --> 35:01.938
But that's my dad.

35:03.268 --> 35:06.317
So... we're brothers?

35:06.521 --> 35:08.615
Be fair, what else could it be?

35:09.274 --> 35:10.617
I don't know.

35:12.193 --> 35:16.073
But he doesn’t just look like me.
He is exactly the same.

35:16.573 --> 35:18.496
There's something else going on here, Jake.

35:18.617 --> 35:19.834
So who are you lot?

35:19.909 --> 35:23.334
We? We are the Preachers.

35:23.913 --> 35:25.415
As in "gospel truth".

35:26.583 --> 35:29.302
Do you see? No Ear Pods.

35:29.377 --> 35:31.971
While the rest of the world
downloads from Cybus Industries,

35:32.047 --> 35:35.142
we have got freedom.

35:36.843 --> 35:39.392
You're talking to London's most wanted.

35:40.597 --> 35:44.852
But target number one is Lumic
and we are going to bring him down.

35:46.061 --> 35:47.938
From your kitchen?

35:50.899 --> 35:52.822
Have you got a problem with that?

35:52.901 --> 35:54.744
No. It's a good kitchen.

35:57.405 --> 36:00.158
- It's an upload from Gemini.
- Who's Gemini?

36:00.241 --> 36:03.871
The vans are back.
They are moving out of Battersea.

36:03.953 --> 36:06.081
Looks like Gemini was right,

36:06.206 --> 36:07.958
Lumic's finally making a move.

36:08.083 --> 36:10.381
And we are right behind him.
Pack up, we're leaving.

37:21.406 --> 37:23.249
I remember her 21st.

37:23.324 --> 37:25.418
Pint of cider in the George.

37:26.578 --> 37:28.205
Sorry, sir, champagne?

37:29.622 --> 37:31.875
Might as well, I'm paying for it.

37:34.169 --> 37:36.092
Big night for you.

37:36.171 --> 37:37.514
For her.

37:38.506 --> 37:40.508
Still, she's happy-

37:40.633 --> 37:43.261
Yeah, she should be. It's a great party.

37:43.344 --> 37:44.891
Do you think?

37:46.055 --> 37:48.979
- You can trust me!
- "You can trust me on this."

37:49.058 --> 37:51.026
That's it, sorry. Yeah.

37:52.562 --> 37:55.941
So, how long have you two been married?

37:56.357 --> 37:57.529
20 years.

37:57.942 --> 37:59.694
No kids, or...

38:00.779 --> 38:02.702
We kept putting it off.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.618
She said she didn't want
to spoil her figure.

38:08.620 --> 38:10.418
It's not too late. She's only 40.

38:10.538 --> 38:11.835
39.

38:11.915 --> 38:14.464
All right, 39.

38:16.294 --> 38:17.887
It's still too late.

38:18.546 --> 38:20.173
I moved out last month.

38:21.090 --> 38:24.139
We're gonna keep it quiet, you know.
It's bad for business.

38:28.056 --> 38:31.435
Why am I telling you all this?
We haven't met before, have we?

38:32.519 --> 38:34.942
- I don't know, you just seem sort of...
- What?

38:36.898 --> 38:38.741
I don't know. just sort of...

38:40.902 --> 38:42.119
right.

38:45.240 --> 38:48.460
Stevie, how's things?
How's it going at Torchwood?

38:53.790 --> 38:57.215
I don't know what they're doing,
but this seems to be the target.

38:57.293 --> 39:01.389
Big house, fair bit of money. Now we've
got to find a way to get in there.

39:01.464 --> 39:03.887
I've identified the address,

39:03.967 --> 39:07.938
it belongs to Peter Tyler,
the Vitex millionaire.

39:08.096 --> 39:09.348
Pete Tyler?

39:09.430 --> 39:13.435
He's listed as one of Lumic's henchmen,
a traitor to the state.

39:14.227 --> 39:17.151
But... We've got to get in there!

39:17.230 --> 39:19.449
Now shut it, duplicate.
That's what I just said.

39:21.609 --> 39:22.906
What are they doing?

39:28.449 --> 39:30.122
What the hell are they?

39:36.624 --> 39:39.969
The most precious thing
on this earth is the human brain...

39:50.138 --> 39:52.766
Mrs Tyler, is there anything I can get you?

39:54.058 --> 39:56.311
The last 20 years back.

39:59.314 --> 40:01.942
I could manage a glass of champagne.

40:02.025 --> 40:04.824
- Or a nice cup of tea?
- Oh, that'd do me.

40:07.322 --> 40:08.915
My mum loves that.

40:08.990 --> 40:10.867
End of a long night,
she never goes straight to bed.

40:10.992 --> 40:13.120
She always stays up
just to have that last cup of tea.

40:13.202 --> 40:15.000
Oh, I'm the same.

40:15.538 --> 40:17.131
- Two sugars.
- And me.

40:17.206 --> 40:19.629
And Pete always says, you know...

40:22.045 --> 40:23.672
Never mind him.

40:25.131 --> 40:28.431
I was talking to him earlier.
He's a nice man.

40:29.344 --> 40:32.689
You know, a bit of a jack the lad,
I suppose, even if he has got money.

40:32.805 --> 40:35.649
But he's a good bloke.

40:37.685 --> 40:38.982
Better than most.

40:42.023 --> 40:43.525
He's worth a second chance.

40:44.567 --> 40:46.865
Are you commenting on my marriage?

40:47.612 --> 40:48.784
No, I was just...

40:48.863 --> 40:51.537
Who the hell do you think you are?
You're staff.

40:51.699 --> 40:55.124
You're nothing but staff. You're just
the serving girl for God's sake!

40:55.203 --> 40:57.547
And you are certainly not getting paid.

40:57.622 --> 40:59.716
Don't you dare talk to me.

41:22.146 --> 41:27.368
This is the ultimate upgrade.
Our greatest step into cyberspace.

41:27.485 --> 41:28.737
Cybus.

41:57.056 --> 41:59.058
It's happening again.

41:59.726 --> 42:01.273
What do you mean?

42:01.394 --> 42:03.442
I've seen them before.

42:05.565 --> 42:06.862
What are they?

42:06.941 --> 42:08.158
Cybermen.

42:30.089 --> 42:31.466
Mr Lumic.

42:31.549 --> 42:35.975
Mr President. I suppose a remark
about crashing the party

42:36.054 --> 42:38.807
would be appropriate at this point, sir.

42:38.931 --> 42:40.274
I forbade this.

42:40.349 --> 42:42.192
These are my children, sir.

42:42.310 --> 42:44.312
Would you deny my family?

42:45.063 --> 42:48.317
- What are they? Robots?
- Worse than that.

42:48.399 --> 42:50.993
- Who were these people?
- It doesn't matter.

42:51.110 --> 42:52.987
They're people?

42:53.071 --> 42:56.746
They were. Till they had all
their humanity taken away.

42:57.492 --> 43:00.587
That's a living brain
jammed inside a cybernetic body.

43:00.661 --> 43:04.382
With a heart of steel,
all emotions removed.

43:04.832 --> 43:06.379
Why no emotions?

43:07.460 --> 43:08.803
Because it hurts.

43:08.878 --> 43:12.257
I demand to know, Lumic, these people,
who were they?

43:12.340 --> 43:14.763
They were homeless
and wretched and useless,

43:14.842 --> 43:17.311
until I saved them, and elevated them,

43:17.386 --> 43:19.354
and gave them life eternal.

43:20.181 --> 43:23.526
And now I leave you
in their capable hands. Good night, sir.

43:23.601 --> 43:25.695
Good night, Mr President.

43:27.814 --> 43:29.908
We have been upgraded.

43:30.274 --> 43:31.821
Into what?

43:31.901 --> 43:34.199
The next level of mankind.

43:34.278 --> 43:36.076
We are Human Point Two.

43:36.239 --> 43:39.539
Every citizen will receive a free upgrade.

43:39.617 --> 43:41.665
You will become like us.

43:41.744 --> 43:44.122
I'm sorry.

43:44.664 --> 43:47.713
I'm so sorry for what's been done to you.

43:48.167 --> 43:49.589
But listen to me.

43:50.670 --> 43:54.140
This experiment ends tonight.

43:54.549 --> 43:56.893
Upgrading is compulsory.

43:57.718 --> 44:00.062
- And if I refuse?
- Don't.

44:00.138 --> 44:01.685
What if I refuse?

44:01.764 --> 44:03.107
I'm telling you, don't!

44:03.224 --> 44:05.852
What happens if I refuse?

44:06.394 --> 44:09.238
Then you are not compatible.

44:10.481 --> 44:12.108
What happens then?

44:13.192 --> 44:15.035
You will be deleted.

44:22.785 --> 44:24.287
Jackie?

44:26.539 --> 44:28.587
Jackie?

44:37.592 --> 44:39.515
There's nothing we can do.

44:39.719 --> 44:41.596
But my mum's in there.

44:41.679 --> 44:43.727
She's not your mother, come on!

44:52.398 --> 44:54.321
Pete! Pete!

45:23.429 --> 45:26.308
- Pete, is there a way out?
- The side gates.

45:26.390 --> 45:28.108
Who are you? How do you know so much?

45:28.184 --> 45:30.437
You wouldn't believe it
in a million years.

45:36.692 --> 45:38.410
Who's that?

45:38.527 --> 45:40.029
Get behind me!

45:52.166 --> 45:54.089
Oh, my God, look at you!

45:54.168 --> 45:56.512
I thought I'd never see you again.

45:58.005 --> 46:00.849
Yeah, no offence, sweetheart,
but who the hell are you?

46:00.925 --> 46:02.393
Rose!

46:03.302 --> 46:06.055
That's not me. That's, like, the other one.

46:06.681 --> 46:09.275
Oh, as if things weren't bad enough,
there's two Mickeys!

46:09.350 --> 46:11.853
- It's Ricky.
- But there's more of them.

46:15.398 --> 46:17.116
We're surrounded.

46:17.191 --> 46:19.660
Put the guns down.
Bullets won't stop them.

46:20.319 --> 46:22.947
You! Stop shooting! Now!

46:24.031 --> 46:25.533
We surrender.

46:26.200 --> 46:27.577
Hands up.

46:30.121 --> 46:33.170
There's no need to damage us.
We're good stock.

46:34.083 --> 46:38.088
We volunteer for the upgrade programme.
Take us to be processed.

46:38.212 --> 46:40.135
You are rogue elements.

46:40.214 --> 46:41.466
But we surrender.

46:41.549 --> 46:43.551
You are incompatible.

46:43.634 --> 46:45.136
But this is a surrender!

46:45.219 --> 46:47.392
You will be deleted.

46:47.513 --> 46:49.732
But we're surrendering!
Listen to me! We surrender!

46:49.849 --> 46:51.476
You are inferior.

46:51.559 --> 46:54.233
Man will be reborn as Cyberman

46:54.312 --> 46:58.112
but you will perish
under maximum deletion.

47:00.484 --> 47:04.580
Delete. Delete. Delete. Delete.
