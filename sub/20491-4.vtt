00:22.634 --> 00:25.868
SHAL, THIS IS THE
FIFTH ONE. I'M WORRIED.

00:25.968 --> 00:27.934
I WANT TO GET THIS GUY.

00:28.033 --> 00:30.000
YEAH.

00:32.567 --> 00:34.000
'SCUSE ME.

00:34.100 --> 00:35.467
HEY.

00:35.567 --> 00:37.601
HEY. GOT HERE AS FAST AS I
COULD. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

00:37.701 --> 00:39.968
BRENNAN, THIS IS
ANDREA MARSHALL.
SHE'S A FRIEND OF MINE.

00:40.067 --> 00:41.934
I'M A PROFILER WITH
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

00:42.033 --> 00:43.734
SHE'S ALSO A PSIONIC.

00:43.834 --> 00:47.167
SHE WAS IN THE MIND OF
ONE OF HER SUBJECTS AND
SAW THIS HAPPEN.

00:47.267 --> 00:48.801
SO, THEN,
WE KNOW WHO DID IT.

00:48.901 --> 00:52.601
THIS LOOKS LIKE THE WORK
OF THE PUZZLE KILLER,
BUT IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

00:52.701 --> 00:54.067
WHY NOT?

00:54.167 --> 00:57.033
HE'S BEEN IN A PSYCHIATRIC
PRISON FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS.

00:57.133 --> 00:58.234
AH, SO IT'S A COPYCAT.

00:58.334 --> 00:59.968
NO. NO. THE DETAILS
OF THE MURDER SPREE

01:00.067 --> 01:02.634
WERE NEVER RELEASED
TO THE PRESS.

01:02.734 --> 01:04.700
LOOK,
I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY,

01:04.801 --> 01:07.400
BUT I HAVE TO STOP THIS GUY

01:07.501 --> 01:10.601
AND AT THIS POINT
I'M UP AGAINST A WALL.

01:11.567 --> 01:12.434
GIVE US A SEC?

01:12.534 --> 01:13.534
YEAH.

01:13.634 --> 01:15.634
HEY...

01:15.734 --> 01:19.067
BREN, I THINK WE SHOULD
TAKE HER BACK TO SANCTUARY
AND SEE IF WE CAN HELP HER.

01:19.167 --> 01:20.534
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT, SHAL.

01:20.634 --> 01:22.200
I TRUST HER.

01:22.300 --> 01:24.100
BECAUSE SHE HAS
SAVED SO MANY PEOPLE,

01:24.200 --> 01:26.200
TAKEN SO MANY
KILLERS OFF THE STREETS.

01:27.467 --> 01:29.734
AREN'T WE IN OVER OUR HEAD HERE?

01:29.834 --> 01:31.067
I MEAN, COME ON, SHOULDN'T WE
LET THE COPS IN ON ALL THIS?

01:31.167 --> 01:32.968
AND TELL THEM
WHAT? SHE'S A MUTANT?

01:33.067 --> 01:35.300
SHE CAN SEE THROUGH
THE EYES OF A KILLER?

01:35.400 --> 01:37.834
LOOK, SHE'S ONE OF US AND
THAT MAKES IT OUR PROBLEM, TOO.

02:00.367 --> 02:03.667
<i>SCIENTIST ADAM KANE WAS
A PIONEER OF GENETIC RESEARCH.</i>

02:03.767 --> 02:08.032
<i>MANIPULATING DNA
TO SAVE HUMAN LIVES.</i>

02:08.133 --> 02:12.200
<i>BUT IN MANY, THEIR
GENES UNEXPECTEDLY MUTATED</i>

02:12.300 --> 02:16.167
<i>AND THEY DEVELOPED
SUPERHUMAN ABILITIES.</i>

02:16.267 --> 02:45.033

02:45.133 --> 02:47.267
<i>TOGETHER, FOUR
OF THE MOST POWERFUL</i>

02:47.367 --> 02:51.133
<i>FIGHT TO PROTECT A WORLD THAT
DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THEY EXIST.</i>

02:53.033 --> 02:56.334
<i>THEY ARE...
MUTANT X.</i>

03:00.868 --> 03:02.467
LEE MARKER'S A MONSTER.

03:02.567 --> 03:04.567
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE
INSIDE HIS HEAD TO SEE THAT.

03:04.667 --> 03:06.334
HE'S THE ONE THEY CALL
THE PUZZLE KILLER, RIGHT?

03:06.434 --> 03:08.534
HE MURDERED
OVER THIRTY WOMEN.

03:08.634 --> 03:12.300
HE LEFT THE LOCATION OF HIS NEXT
MURDER PINNED TO HIS VICTIM.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.167
IT WAS ALWAYS
IN THE FORM OF A PUZZLE,

03:14.267 --> 03:15.901
TAUNTING THE
POLICE TO STOP HIM.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.501
I WAS PART OF THE TEAM THAT
TOOK HIM DOWN TWO YEARS AGO.

03:19.133 --> 03:20.734
SHE'S BEING MODEST.

03:20.834 --> 03:23.467
SHE ACTUALLY LED THE
POLICE RIGHT TO HIM.

03:23.567 --> 03:24.968
ALMOST BECAME ONE OF
HIS VICTIMS THOUGH.

03:25.067 --> 03:26.567
PROBABLY NOT ONE
OF MY SMARTER MOVES.

03:26.667 --> 03:28.300
OKAY, WELL, IF THIS
MARKER'S IN LOCKDOWN,

03:28.400 --> 03:30.434
HOW IS HE BEHIND THESE
CURRENT MURDERS, THEN?

03:30.534 --> 03:33.100
MARKER HAS NO CONTACT
WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

03:33.200 --> 03:36.601
NO RADIO,
NEWSPAPERS, MAIL...

03:36.701 --> 03:39.701
BUT THESE NEW KILLINGS
ARE IDENTICAL TO HIS,

03:39.801 --> 03:40.567
EVEN DOWN TO THE PUZZLES.

03:40.667 --> 03:42.834
WELL, HOW DOES THAT WORK?

03:42.934 --> 03:44.868
I'M AFRAID THE KILLER'S TUNING
INTO MARKER'S MIND THE WAY

03:44.968 --> 03:46.400
SOMEONE LISTENS INTO
A RADIO SIGNAL.

03:46.501 --> 03:50.133
YOU DON'T THINK WE'RE DEALING
WITH ANOTHER PSIONIC, DO YOU?

03:50.234 --> 03:52.968
OKAY, THE PUZZLE HE LEFT ON THE
BODY READ "A STITCH IN TIME".

03:53.067 --> 03:54.033
DOES THAT MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

03:54.133 --> 03:56.067
NO. BUT I'M SURE
IT DOES TO MARKER.

03:56.167 --> 03:58.300
OKAY, WELL,
I'LL GET JESSE TO RUN
THE MUTANT DATABASE,

03:58.400 --> 04:03.300
SEE IF IT KICKS UP
ANYONE WHO FITS THAT PROFILE.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.167
AND IF SOMEONE IS
FEEDING OFF THIS MARKER,

04:05.267 --> 04:07.501
WE'RE GOING TO FIND THEM.

04:07.601 --> 04:09.267
YOU KNOW, EVER SINCE
ADAM INTRODUCED US,

04:09.367 --> 04:12.634
YOU'VE ALWAYS
BEEN KIND OF AN
INSPIRATION TO ME.

04:12.734 --> 04:14.434
I DON'T KNOW, I GUESS
I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT
IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR...

04:14.534 --> 04:17.233
ONE OF US TO LEAD
A NORMAL LIFE, YOU KNOW?

04:17.334 --> 04:20.567
SHALIMAR,
FINDING A PLACE IN SOCIETY
IS MORE ABOUT ACCEPTING

04:20.666 --> 04:27.300
YOURSELF THAN LOOKING
FOR THEM TO ACCEPT US.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.667
I HAD BETTER
GET BACK TO MARKER,

04:28.767 --> 04:30.367
SEE IF THERE'S
ANYTHING I CAN FIND OUT.

04:30.467 --> 04:31.501
I'LL COME WITH?

04:31.601 --> 04:32.667
SURE.

04:35.300 --> 04:35.801
HEY.

04:35.901 --> 04:37.234
HEY.

04:37.334 --> 04:39.534
I BROUGHT COMPANY THIS TIME.

04:39.634 --> 04:44.300
THIS IS SHALIMAR FOX.
SHE'S ON YOUR CLEARED LIST.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.234
OKAY.

04:46.334 --> 04:48.868
THANK YOU.

04:54.267 --> 04:56.000
THIS IS HEAVY SECURITY.

04:56.100 --> 04:57.801
MUST BE ONE BAD BOY.

04:57.901 --> 05:01.267
WAIT UNTIL YOU MEET HIM.

05:01.367 --> 05:05.434
ALL I GET ARE FRACTURED IMAGES,
BUT THE HORRORS I'VE SEEN,

05:05.534 --> 05:08.734
TIP OF THE ICEBERG OF
WHAT'S REALLY IN THERE.

05:17.701 --> 05:21.968
ANDREA,
I COULD FEEL YOU FROM
OUTSIDE THE BUILDING.

05:28.601 --> 05:30.767
DON'T BE RUDE.

05:30.868 --> 05:33.701
INTRODUCE ME TO YOUR FRIEND.

05:33.801 --> 05:36.501
SHALIMAR.

05:36.601 --> 05:38.901
- SHALIMAR.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
SHAM LIAR.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.400
WHAT?

05:43.501 --> 05:45.267
AN ANAGRAM.

05:45.367 --> 05:50.000
THERE'S OFTEN
TRUTH TO THE PUZZLES.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.801
ARE YOU LIKE HER?

05:52.901 --> 05:55.634
THE OTHERS TALK AND TALK.

05:55.734 --> 05:57.834
BUT SHE GETS INSIDE YOU.

05:57.934 --> 06:02.000
IT'S... INTIMATE.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.634
SHE'S HERE TO OBSERVE.

06:03.734 --> 06:06.234
I'M SURE.

06:11.200 --> 06:15.067
THERE WAS ANOTHER
ONE, WASN'T THERE?

06:15.167 --> 06:18.167
IF YOU ONLY KNEW.

06:21.934 --> 06:24.934
WHO IS HIS
NEXT VICTIM?

06:34.400 --> 06:36.033
<GASP>

06:36.133 --> 06:39.400
YOU'RE DOING IT,
AREN'T YOU? I CAN FEEL IT.

06:39.501 --> 06:41.667
<GASP> YES.

06:46.434 --> 06:50.968
THAT'S IT...

06:51.067 --> 06:53.868
<GASP>

06:53.968 --> 06:56.033
HEY...
YOU OKAY, ANDREA?

06:56.133 --> 06:59.701
DID YOU SEE?

07:10.000 --> 07:12.100
YOU SURE YOU'RE
OKAY TO DO THIS?

07:12.200 --> 07:14.634
SOMEONE IS GOING
TO DIE IN THE NEXT FEW
HOURS IF WE DON'T STOP HIM.

07:14.734 --> 07:17.167
I DON'T
HAVE A CHOICE.

07:17.267 --> 07:18.467
OKAY.

07:18.567 --> 07:20.701
NOW JUST TRY TO RELAX.

07:20.801 --> 07:23.300
VISUALIZE WHAT YOU SAW WHEN
YOU WERE INSIDE HIS MIND, OKAY?

07:23.400 --> 07:25.334
ALRIGHT.

07:29.634 --> 07:31.701
WE'RE GOOD TO GO HERE.

07:31.801 --> 07:33.367
WANT TO TALK HER THROUGH IT?

07:33.467 --> 07:34.834
YEAH.

07:34.934 --> 07:36.634
OKAY.

07:36.734 --> 07:40.100
I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT
THE LOCATION THAT HE SHOWED YOU.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.968
WHERE'S THE NEXT KILLING
GOING TO TAKE PLACE?

07:54.300 --> 08:00.767
<PANTING, MOANING>

08:13.701 --> 08:17.133
HEY, I KNOW THAT. IT'S
THE PARRINGTON BANK TOWER.

08:17.234 --> 08:19.567
DO YOU SEE ANYTHING ELSE?

08:19.667 --> 08:21.767
I SAW...

08:27.968 --> 08:29.667
...HER.

08:29.767 --> 08:32.100
UH...

08:34.299 --> 08:35.933
JESS,
YOU GOT THIS LOGGED?

08:36.033 --> 08:37.601
OH, YEAH.

08:37.701 --> 08:39.133
OKAY,
WE'VE GOT ENOUGH.

08:39.234 --> 08:40.967
ANDREA, COME OUT.

08:41.067 --> 08:42.534
ANDREA!

08:45.367 --> 08:47.300
OKAY?

08:49.300 --> 08:52.267
OKAY.
WELL, THE KILLER'S LAST CLUE
READ "A STITCH IN TIME".

08:52.367 --> 08:54.501
SO THE CLOCK'S
GOT TO BE THE TIME.

08:54.601 --> 08:56.067
IT READ ONE O'CLOCK.

08:56.167 --> 08:59.901
PARRINGTON BANK
TOWER FITS THE KILLER'S
GEOGRAPHIC PROFILE.

09:01.467 --> 09:04.567
ALL HIS KILLS HAVE BEEN
WITHIN A SIX-MILE RADIUS.

09:04.667 --> 09:06.167
GUYS, IF HE'S GOING
TO MAKE HIS MOVE AT ONE...

09:06.267 --> 09:07.501
...WE'VE GOT LESS THAN
TWO HOURS TO STOP HIM.

09:07.601 --> 09:09.300
OKAY, I'M GOING
TO GET THIS TO BRENNAN.

09:09.400 --> 09:10.634
I'M GOING BACK
TO THE HOSPITAL.

09:10.734 --> 09:12.000
NO.

09:12.100 --> 09:13.634
I JUST WANT TO TAKE ANOTHER
LOOK AT THE SURVEILLANCE TAPES

09:13.734 --> 09:15.734
FROM MARKER'S CELL, SEE
IF THERE'S ANYTHING I MISSED.

09:15.834 --> 09:18.234
I'LL BE OKAY.

09:21.501 --> 09:23.601
LET'S GO.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.934
ALL RIGHT, IT'S
FIVE MINUTES TO ONE, GUYS.

09:29.033 --> 09:30.767
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYONE
THAT MATCHES A WOMAN IN...

09:30.868 --> 09:32.367
IN ANDREA'S VISION.

09:32.467 --> 09:34.000
YEAH.
NEITHER HAVE I.

09:34.100 --> 09:36.200
CLOCK'S GOT FOUR FACES. WE
GOT A BIG AREA TO COVER.

09:36.300 --> 09:37.868
THERE'S GOT TO
BE MORE TO IT, GUYS.

09:37.968 --> 09:40.734
HE WOULDN'T BE PLANNING ON
DOING IT OUT HERE IN THE OPEN.

09:40.834 --> 09:42.667
ALL RIGHT. ANY LUCK
ON THE IMAGES, JESS?

09:42.767 --> 09:44.467
UH, NO, NOT YET.

09:44.567 --> 09:46.067
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S FROM THE SOUTH SIDE.

09:46.167 --> 09:48.133
BRENNAN,
THAT'S YOUR QUADRANT.

09:59.567 --> 10:01.834
WAIT -
I THINK I GOT SOMETHING.

10:03.100 --> 10:04.601
ALL RIGHT - I GOT OUR
STITCH IN TIME, PEOPLE.

10:04.701 --> 10:06.334
IT'S A MOBILE SEWING
VAN IN THE WEST PARKING LOT.

10:06.434 --> 10:08.501
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

10:18.367 --> 10:20.734
WE'RE TOO LATE.

10:36.934 --> 10:39.834
WE JUST MISSED HIM.

10:52.868 --> 10:54.834
OH, THANKS.

10:54.934 --> 10:57.133
THERE YOU GO.

11:03.334 --> 11:06.334
THEY'RE FOR
THE HEADACHES.

11:06.434 --> 11:09.868
IS THAT PART
OF THE PRICE YOU PAY
FOR YOUR MUTANT ABILITY?

11:09.968 --> 11:11.968
MMM.

11:12.067 --> 11:16.734
I ALWAYS FELT THAT THE FACT
I GOT TO USE MY GIFT TO SAVE

11:16.834 --> 11:18.868
LIVES MADE IT WORTHWHILE.

11:18.968 --> 11:21.367
BUT NOW I FEEL I'M
NOT EVEN ABLE TO DO THAT.

11:21.467 --> 11:23.267
CAN'T FEEL THAT WAY.

11:23.367 --> 11:25.267
YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING YOU CAN,
AND WE'RE GOING TO FIND HIM. I
PROMISE.

11:25.367 --> 11:28.534
BUT JESSE DIDN'T' FIND ANYONE
ON ADAM'S MUTANT DATABASE.

11:28.634 --> 11:31.968
HOW DO YOU TRACK DOWN SOMEONE
AS SMART AND POWERFUL AS MARKER?

11:32.067 --> 11:33.868
BY BEING SMARTER
AND MORE POWERFUL.

11:33.968 --> 11:35.834
I CAN'T HELP
BUT FEEL WE'RE RIGHT
BACK WHERE WE STARTED.

11:35.934 --> 11:38.033
WELL, IT'S GOING TO
BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME,

11:38.133 --> 11:39.667
BECAUSE WE'RE
GOING TO CATCH HIM.

11:39.767 --> 11:41.734
I CAN'T SIT AROUND WAITING
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN.

11:41.834 --> 11:43.767
I'M GOING
TO SEE MARKER AGAIN.

11:43.868 --> 11:45.434
WHAT?
AND CONNECT WITH HIM?

11:45.534 --> 11:46.968
ANDREA, LOOK AT
WHAT IT'S DOING TO IT.

11:47.067 --> 11:48.901
IT'S NOT ABOUT
ME, SHALIMAR.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.234
YOU KNOW, I'VE LEARNED A
FEW THINGS ABOUT PSIONICS.

11:51.334 --> 11:55.467
WHEN YOU SPEND ENOUGH TIME IN
OTHER PEOPLE'S HEADS YOU START

11:55.567 --> 11:57.400
TO TAKE ON THE PROBLEMS
OF THE WHOLE WORLD.

11:57.501 --> 11:59.467
YOU FEEL
EVERYBODY'S PAIN, YOU FEEL
RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING.

11:59.567 --> 12:01.767
I DON'T HAVE
A MARTYR COMPLEX.

12:01.868 --> 12:03.267
I DIDN'T SAY YOU DID.

12:03.367 --> 12:07.501
I'M JUST SAYING IT'S
AN OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD.

12:07.601 --> 12:10.000
OKAY,
LET US... LET US FIND HIM.

12:10.100 --> 12:13.834
TAKE CARE OF
YOURSELF FOR A CHANGE.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.934
4-2-1-6-8-2-5-8...

12:23.033 --> 12:24.901
YEAH,
BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

12:25.000 --> 12:26.634
WHAT DOES IT MEAN,
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

12:26.734 --> 12:29.501
UM...
LOCKER COMBINATION?

12:29.601 --> 12:33.734
SECURITY CODE?
- IT COULD BE ANYTHING.

12:33.834 --> 12:35.667
I KNOW. BUT WE'RE RUNNING
AROUND IN CIRCLES HERE.

12:35.767 --> 12:38.801
I CONTACTED MY SOURCES FOR
MORE BACKGROUND ON MARKER.

12:38.901 --> 12:42.968
HIS CLUES ALWAYS REFER TO
THE LOCATION OF THE NEXT MURDER.

12:43.067 --> 12:46.334
HE USED EVERYTHING
FROM CROSSWORD PUZZLES
TO BIBLICAL PASSAGES.

12:46.434 --> 12:47.834
COULD IT BE AN ADDRESS?

12:47.934 --> 12:49.634
NO, I TRIED THAT.
CAME UP WITH NOTHING.

12:49.734 --> 12:51.968
YOU KNOW, THERE DOESN'T
EVEN SEEM TO BE ANY
PATTERN TO THE NUMBERS.

12:52.067 --> 12:55.334
ANDREA WANTS TO
GO QUESTION MARKER AGAIN,

12:55.434 --> 12:57.033
SO I'M GOING
TO GO WITH HER.

12:57.133 --> 12:58.434
YOU FOUND SOMETHING?

12:58.534 --> 13:00.100
NAH, WE'VE BEEN
WORKING THE CLUE
FOR THE LAST KILLING

13:00.200 --> 13:01.534
SIX WAYS
FROM SUNDAY.

13:01.634 --> 13:02.901
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO
COME UP WITH MUCH.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.100
MAYBE IT'S A CODE,
LIKE A... CRYPTOGRAM...

13:05.200 --> 13:07.000
...OR AN ANAGRAM
OR A PALINDROME.

13:07.100 --> 13:09.667
THE ONLY WAY TO FIGURE IT OUT IS
TO PLAY ALL THE POSSIBLE GAMES.

13:09.767 --> 13:11.400
YEAH, BY THAT POINT
IT'LL BE TOO LATE.

13:11.501 --> 13:13.100
WE CAN'T
EVEN THINK THAT.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.734
NO.

13:14.834 --> 13:16.234
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:16.334 --> 13:17.667
ALL RIGHT,
JESS, COME ON, MAN.

13:17.767 --> 13:18.968
LET'S FIGURE
OUT WHAT THIS MEANS.

13:19.067 --> 13:20.067
COME ON.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.534
OKAY.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.033
MAYBE IF I TRANSPOSE
THE NUMBERS INTO LETTERS.

13:25.567 --> 13:28.634
<i>WONDERFUL AFTERNOON
FOR MIND GAMES, ANDREA.</i>

13:28.734 --> 13:30.501
YOU SURE
HE'S NOT PSIONIC?

13:30.601 --> 13:32.801
I'D KNOW.

13:36.133 --> 13:38.968
LISTEN, IF YOU NEED
TO DO THIS TO CLEAR YOUR
CONSCIENCE, I UNDERSTAND.

13:39.067 --> 13:40.801
AND I'LL
BE THERE FOR YOU.

13:40.901 --> 13:42.601
BUT YOU JUST
GET WHAT YOU NEED
AND GET OUT, OKAY?

13:42.701 --> 13:45.367
OKAY.

13:54.701 --> 13:56.934
TELL ME,
DID YOU SEE HER?

13:57.033 --> 13:59.868
HOW WAS IT?

13:59.968 --> 14:03.000
DID YOU FIND
HER WAITING FOR YOU?

14:03.100 --> 14:05.834
QUIET, LIFELESS?

14:05.934 --> 14:08.400
YOU ALREADY KNOW.

14:08.501 --> 14:11.968
YOU SEEM
TO KNOW EVERYTHING.

14:12.067 --> 14:15.901
NOT EVERYTHING.
NOT YET.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.534
ENOUGH!

14:17.634 --> 14:19.767
THIS IS OUR
FINAL SESSION.

14:19.868 --> 14:23.767
WELL,
IN THAT CASE, WHY DON'T
WE PULL OUT ALL THE STOPS?

14:23.868 --> 14:26.267
FINE WITH ME.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.667
HMM...

14:31.834 --> 14:33.667
HOW'S HE DOING IT, LEE?

14:33.767 --> 14:35.567
TELL ME.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.267
YOU KNOW.

14:37.367 --> 14:40.000
YOU CAN SEE IT.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.067
ANDREA?

14:54.267 --> 14:55.200
OH...!

14:55.300 --> 14:56.534
ANDREA,
LET HIM GO!

14:56.634 --> 14:58.868
AGH...!

15:00.501 --> 15:04.834
WELL,
WASN'T THAT REFRESHING?

15:04.934 --> 15:07.067
SHALIMAR, YOU'RE
JUST MY TYPE, YOU KNOW?

15:07.167 --> 15:11.000
WE COULD HAVE
SO MUCH FUN TOGETHER.

15:11.100 --> 15:14.133
I DON'T THINK YOU'D
LIKE MY KIND OF FUN.

15:17.067 --> 15:19.601
I'LL SEE YOU
AGAIN, SHALIMAR.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.234
PLEASE
- I'M OKAY.

15:27.334 --> 15:30.367
I'M OKAY.
I'M OKAY.

15:30.467 --> 15:31.734
WHAT HAPPENED?

15:31.834 --> 15:33.300
HE WAS DOING
SOMETHING TO HER.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.968
HE OPENED
UP MORE OF HIS MIND.

15:35.067 --> 15:36.367
HE TOOK ME BACK.

15:36.467 --> 15:38.267
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

15:38.367 --> 15:44.267
HIS PREVIOUS KILLS. THE
THRILL HE GOT FROM THEIR PAIN.

15:46.033 --> 15:47.434
AND WHAT
ABOUT THE NEXT ONE?

15:47.534 --> 15:50.934
OH, PIECES.

15:52.100 --> 15:55.000
BUT I THINK
I GOT SOMETHING.

15:55.100 --> 15:56.634
HOOK ME UP?

15:56.734 --> 15:58.400
OKAY.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.634
NOW, LOOK...
ONCE I SWITCH THIS ON,

16:01.734 --> 16:03.767
I WANT YOU TO
SEPARATE THE IMAGES.

16:03.868 --> 16:07.033
JUST GIVE US THE ONES
THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH
THE NEXT MURDER, OKAY?

16:07.133 --> 16:08.767
OKAY.

16:08.868 --> 16:11.367
OKAY,
HERE WE GO.

16:14.501 --> 16:16.167
ALL RIGHT.

16:16.267 --> 16:22.167
OKAY. ANDREA, WHERE IS THE NEXT
KILLING GOING TO TAKE PLACE?

16:29.934 --> 16:31.734
COME ON, ANDREA,
CONCENTRATE.

16:31.834 --> 16:34.567
ANYTHING...
ANYTHING AT ALL.

16:36.868 --> 16:38.534
COME ON.

16:38.634 --> 16:42.734
OKAY, FOUR, TWO, ONE, SIX,
EIGHT, TWO, FIVE, EIGHT.

16:42.834 --> 16:45.200
WHAT DO THOSE NUMBERS MEAN?

17:06.300 --> 17:09.567
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S THE LOCATION.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.233
IT LOOKS LIKE SOME KIND
OF CHEMICAL WAREHOUSE.

17:16.334 --> 17:17.634
MEDICAL SUPPLIES.

17:17.733 --> 17:19.534
THOSE GREEN TANKS ARE OXYGEN.

17:19.634 --> 17:21.067
YEAH,
AND IN A CITY THIS SIZE
THERE COULD BE DOZENS OF

17:21.166 --> 17:23.032
MEDICAL SUPPLY PLACES.

17:23.133 --> 17:24.767
OH, MY GOD. OF COURSE.

17:24.867 --> 17:26.701
THE NUMBER IN THE KILLER'S
LAST CLUE - THEY'RE COORDINATES.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.000
BUT I THOUGHT YOU RAN
AN ADDRESS CHECK ALREADY.

17:29.100 --> 17:30.100
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

17:30.200 --> 17:31.834
NO, NO, LOOK -
LONGITUDE AND LATITUDE.

17:31.934 --> 17:34.334
DEGREES AND MINUTES.

17:39.033 --> 17:40.567
WAIT, WAIT - I...
I KNOW THAT NAME.

17:40.667 --> 17:42.133
ANS MEDICAL SUPPLIES.

17:42.234 --> 17:44.767
BEFORE MARKER
WAS ARRESTED HE
USED TO WORK THERE.

17:44.868 --> 17:48.133
MAYBE OUR NEW KILLER'S
FEELING NOSTALGIC.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.100
BRENNAN, HOW LONG
WILL IT TAKE FOR YOU AND
LEXA TO GET DOWN THERE?

17:50.200 --> 17:51.601
TWENTY MINUTES TOPS.

17:51.701 --> 17:53.267
YOU FEELING
UP TO COMING WITH US?

17:53.367 --> 17:54.834
NO, SHE'S NOT.

17:54.934 --> 17:57.033
SHALIMAR, IT WOULD REALLY
HELP IF WE HAD A VISUAL ID,
ALL RIGHT?

17:57.133 --> 17:58.701
DON'T WORRY - I PROMISE
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF HER.

17:58.801 --> 18:00.334
I'LL BE OKAY.

18:00.434 --> 18:03.300
SHALIMAR, I HAVE TO
SEE THIS THING FINISHED.

18:13.968 --> 18:17.667
I REMEMBER THE WINDOWS,
THE SMELL OF AMMONIA.

18:17.767 --> 18:19.567
THIS IS IT.

18:19.667 --> 18:21.067
HEY!

18:21.167 --> 18:22.734
NO, YOU DID YOUR JOB.

18:22.834 --> 18:25.267
NOW LET US DO OURS.

18:25.367 --> 18:27.000
YEAH, STAY IN THE CAR.

18:27.100 --> 18:28.801
NOW, IF YOU SEE
ANYTHING, USE THIS.

18:28.901 --> 18:30.234
IT'S KEYED
TO OUR SIGNAL.

18:30.334 --> 18:33.133
WE'LL BE BACK
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

18:45.801 --> 18:47.567
LOOKS PRETTY EMPTY.

18:47.667 --> 18:49.434
WHAT DO WE DO, WAIT?

18:49.534 --> 18:51.767
NO.
LET'S KEEP LOOKING.

18:51.868 --> 18:54.501
FOR WHAT?

18:54.601 --> 18:58.400
IN ORDER TO HAVE A
MURDER, YOU NEED A VICTIM.

18:58.501 --> 19:00.601
<i>BRENNAN. BRENNAN,
HE'S CLOSE.</i>

19:00.701 --> 19:02.133
ALL RIGHT.

19:02.234 --> 19:04.667
KEEP THE DOORS
LOCKED AND LET US KNOW
IF YOU SEE ANYTHING.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.534
WE WERE SET UP.

19:12.634 --> 19:15.634
DON'T BREATHE.

19:48.934 --> 19:51.701
YEAH?
WELL, TAKE A DEEP
BREATH AND BLOW.

19:51.801 --> 19:53.968
DO IT.

19:55.400 --> 19:56.834
HM.

19:56.934 --> 19:58.567
SO WHAT HAPPENED
IN THERE, ANYWAY?

19:58.667 --> 19:59.734
HE PLAYED US.

19:59.834 --> 20:01.234
NO, IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.100
LISTEN,
HE KNOWS THAT YOU DIG
AROUND IN HIS HEAD, OKAY?

20:03.200 --> 20:05.000
ALL HE DID
WAS PLANT THE LOCATION
AND THEN GIVE HIS PARTNER

20:05.100 --> 20:06.334
THE HEADS UP.

20:06.434 --> 20:07.868
IT DOESN'T
WORK THAT WAY.

20:07.968 --> 20:10.334
TELL THAT TO
MY BLACK LUNG.

20:10.434 --> 20:12.000
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

20:12.100 --> 20:13.667
THE IMAGES I GET ARE
FROM THE SUBCONSCIOUS.

20:13.767 --> 20:15.434
MARKER COULDN'T
POSSIBLY CONTROL THEM.

20:15.534 --> 20:17.534
LOOK, I HATE
TO BREAK IT TO YOU, BUT
AT THIS POINT I DOUBT

20:17.634 --> 20:19.767
YOU HAVE A GRIP ON WHAT HE'S
CAPABLE OF OR WHAT HE'S DOING.

20:19.868 --> 20:22.601
SO WHAT DOES
THAT LEAVE US WITH?

20:23.467 --> 20:25.601
ME.

20:25.701 --> 20:28.834
AFTER ALL,
I AM HIS TYPE, REMEMBER?

20:28.934 --> 20:30.367
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

20:30.467 --> 20:32.100
I WANT TO GO
BACK TO THE HOSPITAL.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.100
AND THIS TIME I WANT
TO TALK TO MARKER ALONE.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.968
YOU CRAZY?
HE'S A HOMICIDAL MANIAC.

20:36.067 --> 20:37.567
YEAH, JESSE'S RIGHT.

20:37.667 --> 20:39.968
I WANT THIS GUY AS BAD AS
YOU DO, BUT... NOT LIKE THIS.

20:40.067 --> 20:41.701
LISTEN, WE NEED TO
TURN THE TABLES ON THIS GUY.

20:41.801 --> 20:44.033
I KNOW HOW TO
GET UNDER HIS SKIN.

20:44.133 --> 20:45.901
YEAH, ONCE HE
LETS HIS GUARD DOWN,

20:46.000 --> 20:48.334
ANDREA CAN GET DEEPER
INTO HIS SUBCONSCIOUS.

20:48.434 --> 20:50.501
YEAH, BUT TO DO
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
GET UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL.

20:50.601 --> 20:54.567
I'M GOING TO NEED TO GET
INTO THE CELL WITH HIM.

20:54.667 --> 20:56.100
NO,
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

20:56.200 --> 20:58.167
THE WARDEN WILL
NEVER GIVE PERMISSION.

20:58.267 --> 21:00.734
YEAH, WELL, WHO SAYS
WE'RE GONNA ASK HIM?

21:04.734 --> 21:06.901
YOU SURE YOU'RE UP FOR THIS?

21:07.000 --> 21:08.634
I'M NOT AFRAID OF HIM.

21:08.734 --> 21:11.567
I WOULDN'T GIVE
HIM THE PLEASURE.

21:23.267 --> 21:25.601
WATCH THIS GUY FOR ME?

21:27.667 --> 21:29.834
HOW YOU DOIN', THERE?

21:32.801 --> 21:35.133
OOH, TIME FLIES, HUH?

21:49.968 --> 21:52.868
ANOTHER PSYCHO...

21:52.968 --> 21:56.767
...ANOTHER DAY.

22:20.334 --> 22:22.267
SAVED YOU THE TROUBLE.

22:22.367 --> 22:24.868
<LAUGH>

22:40.901 --> 22:42.734
EVERYONE
IN POSITION?

22:42.834 --> 22:44.801
HEADING THERE NOW.

22:59.934 --> 23:01.734
I NEED YOU TO STAY
CLEAR OF MARKER'S CELL FOR

23:01.834 --> 23:04.000
THIRTY MORE SECONDS, ALL RIGHT?

23:11.167 --> 23:13.400
CLEAN VIDEO LOOP'S
ALMOST IN PLACE.

23:15.467 --> 23:18.033
I CAN BUY YOU ABOUT
FOUR MINUTES STARTING...

23:18.133 --> 23:20.501
NOW.

23:23.968 --> 23:25.801
LET'S GO.
ALL RIGHT.

23:26.968 --> 23:28.267
I'LL BE WATCHING ANDREA.

23:28.367 --> 23:29.634
IF MARKER TRIES
ANYTHING...

23:29.734 --> 23:32.734
LET HIM TRY. HE'LL BE DEAD
BEFORE HE HITS THE GROUND.

23:35.567 --> 23:38.400
CLOCK IS TICKING.

23:39.400 --> 23:41.667
PHEW...

23:44.868 --> 23:47.400
NOW THAT IS A NICE TRICK.

23:47.501 --> 23:50.100
IT'S LIKE FAST FOOD DELIVERY.

23:50.200 --> 23:51.901
I THOUGHT IT
WAS TIME WE HAD A TALK.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.434
JUST THE TWO OF US.

23:56.534 --> 23:59.100
SHALL WE PRETEND
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME?

23:59.200 --> 24:01.334
EVERYTHING IN ME WANTS
A PIECE OF THIS GUY.

24:01.434 --> 24:02.934
- GET IN LINE.

24:04.167 --> 24:07.367
I KNEW YOU'D COME BACK.

24:07.467 --> 24:10.000
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ME.

24:10.100 --> 24:13.734
GIRLS LIKE YOU,
YOU THINK YOU'RE STRONG.

24:13.834 --> 24:15.901
BUT ALL FLESH CUTS.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.033
INCLUDING YOURS.

24:19.133 --> 24:24.734
ENOUGH GAMES.
YOU WANT TO IMPRESS ME?

24:24.834 --> 24:29.100
TELL ME WHO'S
THE NEXT VICTIM.

24:29.200 --> 24:33.334
WHY NOT ASK YOUR
DIRTY LITTLE FRIEND?

24:33.434 --> 24:37.234
THE ONE WHO KEEPS PLAYING
PEEPING TOM IN MY BRAIN.

24:37.334 --> 24:39.300
MMM.

24:39.400 --> 24:42.601
I CAN FEEL
HER IN ME RIGHT NOW.

24:46.567 --> 24:48.167
ANDREA, ANYTHING?

24:48.267 --> 24:51.133
HE'S FIGHTING ME.
BUT I'M CLOSE...

24:52.100 --> 24:53.467
SHALIMAR,
WE'RE LOSING TIME.

24:53.567 --> 24:55.400
ASK HIM ABOUT THE PARTNER.

24:55.501 --> 25:01.267
YOUR PARTNER
TRIED AMBUSHING
US AT THE WAREHOUSE.

25:01.367 --> 25:04.200
HE FAILED.

25:04.300 --> 25:07.534
WHO IS HE?

25:07.634 --> 25:09.801
IF YOU DON'T
HAVE THE RIGHT QUESTION,

25:09.901 --> 25:12.567
WHY SHOULD I GIVE
YOU THE RIGHT ANSWER?

25:12.667 --> 25:15.367
IF YOU WEREN'T SUCH A
COWARD, MAYBE YOU'D TELL ME.

25:15.467 --> 25:18.634
YOU'D SCREAM
LIKE THE REST OF THEM.

25:18.734 --> 25:21.968
THIS WHOLE GAME
WOULD END, WOULDN'T IT?

25:22.067 --> 25:24.601
I AM DEATH.
I DON'T FEAR IT.

25:24.701 --> 25:27.767
HOW ABOUT PAIN?

25:33.901 --> 25:34.801
<SCREAMS>

25:34.901 --> 25:36.567
JESS, GET SHALIMAR
OUT OF THE ROOM NOW.

25:37.968 --> 25:39.667
SHALIMAR!

25:47.434 --> 25:49.367
COME HERE.

25:52.734 --> 25:55.100
ANDREA, DID IT WORK?
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

25:55.200 --> 25:59.000
HIS NEXT VICTIM.

25:59.100 --> 26:00.968
WHO?

26:01.067 --> 26:03.400
IT'S ME.

26:05.267 --> 26:09.467
<CLAPPING>
CLEVER GIRL.

26:09.567 --> 26:11.834
COME ON.

26:21.467 --> 26:23.801
IT'S NOT WORKING.

26:31.601 --> 26:34.334
<MOANING>

26:44.734 --> 26:47.400
AH!

26:48.734 --> 26:52.167
HEY, YOU OKAY?

26:52.267 --> 26:58.067
I'M SORRY. THAT'S
WHERE IT BROKE OFF.

26:58.167 --> 27:01.000
MAYBE WE
CAN TRY AGAIN.

27:01.100 --> 27:04.901
NO, I THINK MAYBE
YOU NEED TO REST.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
OKAY, WHY DON'T
YOU GO LIE DOWN IN
MY ROOM FOR A BIT?

27:09.901 --> 27:11.400
YEAH.

27:11.501 --> 27:14.200
OKAY.

27:19.300 --> 27:22.467
THIS IS REALLY STARTING
TO TAKE A TOLL ON HER.

27:22.567 --> 27:24.534
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
KNOWS ANDREA BEST.

27:24.634 --> 27:26.634
YOU THINK SHE'S STRONG
ENOUGH TO CONTINUE?

27:26.734 --> 27:29.634
TRUST ME
- SHE'S NOT GOING TO STOP
UNTIL WE FIND THIS KILLER.

27:35.701 --> 27:38.300
SO JESS FIND ANYTHING
ON THOSE LAST IMAGES?

27:38.400 --> 27:39.167
HE'S STILL TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT WHICH BUILDING IT IS.

27:39.267 --> 27:40.167
DAMN.

27:40.267 --> 27:41.267
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M
GETTING REALLY TIRED

27:41.367 --> 27:43.000
OF BEING ONE STEP
BEHIND THIS KILLER.

27:43.100 --> 27:45.367
WE HAVE A GOLDEN
OPPORTUNITY STARING
US RIGHT IN THE FACE.

27:45.467 --> 27:47.000
WHAT'S THAT?

27:47.100 --> 27:48.567
KILLER CHOSE HER.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.701
I SAY WE USE
ANDREA AS A DECOY
TO DRAW HIM OUT.

27:50.801 --> 27:52.901
HEY, IF YOU'VE
GOT A BETTER IDEA,
I'D LOVE TO HEAR IT.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.033
GUYS, SHE'S GONE.
ANDREA TOOK OFF.

27:55.133 --> 27:56.801
WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?

27:56.901 --> 27:58.601
SHE KNOWS SHE'S THE NEXT
TUNE ON MARKER'S HIT PARADE.

27:58.701 --> 28:00.534
SHE THINKS SHE'S THE
ONLY ONE WHO CAN STOP HIM.

28:00.634 --> 28:02.033
LOOK, CAN YOU GUYS
CHECK OUT HER PLACE?

28:02.133 --> 28:03.467
I'M GOING
TO START CHECKING
OUT THE STREETS.

28:03.567 --> 28:04.968
WELL,
IT'S A BIG JOB.

28:05.067 --> 28:06.734
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO START?

28:06.834 --> 28:08.534
WELL, I'M THINKING
OF ANDREA'S TRYING
TO DRAW OUT THE KILLER,

28:08.634 --> 28:11.534
THEN SHE'LL BE CHECKING
OUT THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC
PROFILE AS MARKER.

28:24.801 --> 28:27.234
OH...

28:37.667 --> 28:39.467
ANDREA, WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

28:39.567 --> 28:41.133
I COULDN'T
JUST SIT AROUND.

28:41.234 --> 28:43.067
THIS IS MY FIGHT.

28:43.167 --> 28:46.634
FOR SOME REASON,
I WAS DRAWN TO THIS PLACE.

28:46.734 --> 28:49.334
YOU THINK HE'S IN HERE?

28:49.434 --> 28:53.067
I'M NOT SURE
OF ANYTHING ANY MORE.

28:53.167 --> 28:55.100
I KNOW I'M
GETTING SOMETHING.

28:55.200 --> 28:58.334
I THINK IT'S COMING
FROM THE TOP FLOOR.

28:58.434 --> 29:00.234
IT MIGHT
BE ANOTHER CLUE.

29:00.334 --> 29:02.834
WELL,
I'M GONNA GO CHECK IT OUT.

29:02.934 --> 29:04.767
AND YOU?

29:04.868 --> 29:06.801
GET AWAY FROM HERE, OKAY?

29:06.901 --> 29:08.901
JUST GO.

31:17.567 --> 31:20.100
WHERE ARE YOU?!

31:29.834 --> 31:32.934
IF YOU WANT ME
COME AND GET ME!

31:38.067 --> 31:40.300
GUYS...

31:55.868 --> 31:58.400
YOU'VE SEEN BETTER DAYS.

31:58.501 --> 32:00.267
BUT THEN AGAIN,
SO HAVE I.

32:00.367 --> 32:02.834
WHAT HAVE YOU
DONE WITH SHALIMAR?

32:02.934 --> 32:06.300
WHY ASK ME WHEN YOU
HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS?

32:06.400 --> 32:09.234
QUIT PLAYING WITH ME!

32:09.334 --> 32:11.267
HOW ARE YOU DOING THIS?!

32:11.367 --> 32:13.968
TELL ME WHAT I WANT TO KNOW!

32:17.000 --> 32:20.033
THEN COME ON IN.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.767
<GASP>

32:42.667 --> 32:44.434
NICE.

32:44.534 --> 32:46.000
DID YOU FIND ANDREA?

32:46.100 --> 32:47.734
NO,
SHE WASN'T AT HER PLACE.

32:47.834 --> 32:49.534
ANY WORD FROM SHALIMAR?

32:49.634 --> 32:51.133
NOTHING YET.

32:51.234 --> 32:52.701
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

32:52.801 --> 32:54.267
WELL,
THESE ARE THE LAST IMAGES
THAT ANDREA GAVE US.

32:54.367 --> 32:57.100
SHE CUT OFF THE CONNECTION
BECAUSE IT WAS CAUSING HER PAIN.

32:57.200 --> 32:59.267
BUT I THINK I
CAN RAISE THE DETAIL.

32:59.367 --> 33:02.534
SEE, THESE IMAGES ARE
THROUGH THE EYES OF THE KILLER.

33:02.634 --> 33:04.801
IF I CAN GET THE RESOLUTION
HIGH ENOUGH I'M PRETTY SURE

33:04.901 --> 33:09.234
I CAN GET HIS REFLECTION OFF
OF THAT PIECE OF GLASS THERE.

33:09.334 --> 33:11.534
I UNDERSTAND NOW.

33:11.634 --> 33:13.467
YES,
I BELIEVE YOU DO.

33:13.567 --> 33:17.334
TOO BAD. I WAS ENJOYING
OUR LITTLE GAME.

33:17.434 --> 33:19.534
DON'T END IT.

33:19.634 --> 33:21.901
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU HAVE TO DO.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.467
WHAT YOU MUST DO.

33:31.300 --> 33:33.667
NICE. RAISE THE
RESOLUTION A BIT...

33:39.767 --> 33:41.701
WELL, IT DEFINITELY
LOOKS LIKE A FACE.

33:41.801 --> 33:44.067
CAN YOU CLEAN
IT UP A LITTLE?

34:12.766 --> 34:15.601
VERY GOOD.

34:15.701 --> 34:19.967
I HAD AN
EXCELLENT TEACHER.

34:26.567 --> 34:28.234
IT'S ANDREA.

34:28.333 --> 34:31.100
SHE'S THE KILLER? IT
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

34:31.199 --> 34:32.868
YES IT DOES.

34:32.967 --> 34:35.100
SHE SPENT ALL
THAT TIME CONNECTED TO
MARKER INSIDE HIS MIND.

34:35.199 --> 34:37.734
HE INFECTED HER SOMEHOW.

34:37.833 --> 34:40.234
SHALIMAR...

34:47.567 --> 34:49.534
STILL NOTHING
FROM SHALIMAR'S COMLINK.

34:49.634 --> 34:51.434
I HOPE SHE'S
STILL ALIVE.

34:51.534 --> 34:53.167
SHE'S A FERAL.

34:53.266 --> 34:55.868
I HAVE TO THINK
SHE'S STRONG ENOUGH TO DEFEND
HERSELF AGAINST ANDREA.

34:55.967 --> 34:58.300
YEAH,
BUT NOT IF SHE DOESN'T
KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.033
YOU GUYS
AREN'T GOING TO BELIEVE
WHAT I JUST GOT OFF THE

35:00.133 --> 35:02.067
VIDEO FEED
FROM MARKER'S CELL.

35:02.167 --> 35:04.100
HE'S DEAD.

35:04.200 --> 35:05.934
BUT HOW?

35:06.033 --> 35:10.133
ANDREA.
LOOKS LIKE SHE STABBED HIM.

35:10.234 --> 35:12.801
OH,
AND THIS IS FREAKY.

35:12.901 --> 35:15.400
SHE WROTE DOWN THE NEXT CLUE
IN MARKER'S OWN HANDWRITING.

35:15.501 --> 35:17.234
WHAT'S IT SAY?

35:17.334 --> 35:19.934
MARIE TALBOT.

35:20.033 --> 35:22.801
THAT'S GOTTA BE THE
CLUE TO THE NEXT LOCATION.

35:22.901 --> 35:25.667
THAT'S WHERE SHE'S
GONNA KILL SHALIMAR.

35:36.767 --> 35:38.367
OH, THANK GOD.

35:38.467 --> 35:40.901
ANDREA, YOU HAVE
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.133
JUST GO.

35:42.234 --> 35:43.701
CALL THE GUYS,
TELL THEM WHERE I AM.

35:43.801 --> 35:45.367
WE WON'T NEED THEM.

35:45.467 --> 35:46.801
I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.

35:46.901 --> 35:48.000
ANDREA...?

35:48.100 --> 35:53.968
I'VE HAD ANOTHER VISION.
I KNOW WHO'S GOING TO DIE.

35:54.067 --> 35:57.400
YOU.

35:57.501 --> 36:04.467
<LAUGHING>

36:09.334 --> 36:11.200
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT, ANDREA?

36:11.300 --> 36:12.868
ANDREA?

36:12.968 --> 36:16.133
TSK, TSK, TSK...
DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE.

36:16.234 --> 36:18.100
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

36:18.200 --> 36:20.400
YOU HAVE TO FIGHT HIM.

36:20.501 --> 36:23.067
I TRIED.

36:23.167 --> 36:28.367
I REFUSED TO BELIEVE IT.
I CLOSED MY MIND TO IT.

36:28.467 --> 36:32.901
BUT THAT WAS FOOLISH.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.801
YOU CAN BEAT HIM.

36:36.901 --> 36:40.267
TOO LATE.

36:40.367 --> 36:43.234
I'M NOT THAT
EASY TO KILL.

36:43.334 --> 36:48.167
'COURSE YOU ARE.
YOU WON'T FIGHT ME.

36:48.267 --> 36:53.334
YOU WON'T EVEN TRY.
I CAN BE IN YOUR MIND...

37:09.033 --> 37:12.634
YOU SEE? HELPLESS.

37:17.667 --> 37:19.467
LOTS OF TALBOTS.
NO MARIE.

37:19.567 --> 37:21.367
GUYS, WE DON'T
HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

37:21.467 --> 37:22.968
WE NEED TO
FIND THE LOCATION.

37:23.067 --> 37:26.367
WAIT.
WHAT IF MARIE TALBOT
IS OUR LOCATION?

37:26.467 --> 37:28.601
AN ANAGRAM.

37:28.701 --> 37:31.767
RUNNING THE
POSSIBILITIES.

37:31.868 --> 37:35.000
OKAY,
I'VE GOT A BOAT AIR MOTEL.

37:35.100 --> 37:36.501
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

37:36.601 --> 37:40.801
A TRIBAL TOME.
A MEAT RIB LOT.

37:40.901 --> 37:42.734
ELM ABATTOIR.

37:42.834 --> 37:44.267
ABATTOIR?

37:44.367 --> 37:46.067
HEY, WAIT...
WAIT, THERE'S A...

37:46.167 --> 37:47.767
THERE'S
A SLAUGHTERHOUSE ON
ELM STREET THAT'S BEEN

37:47.868 --> 37:49.400
ABANDONED FOR
A COUPLE OF YEARS.

37:49.501 --> 37:51.434
LET'S GO.

37:54.767 --> 37:56.934
ANDREA,
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.

37:57.033 --> 37:59.601
I KNOW YOU'RE
IN THERE SOMEWHERE.

37:59.701 --> 38:01.868
THE ANDREA
I KNOW IS STRONG.

38:01.968 --> 38:06.501
SHE WOULD NEVER LET HER
MIND BE POISONED LIKE THIS.

38:06.601 --> 38:10.000
SHALIMAR?

38:10.100 --> 38:13.167
HELP ME.

38:41.968 --> 38:43.667
IT'S THIS WAY.

38:43.767 --> 38:46.267
I RECOGNIZE THIS
WALL FROM THE IMAGE.

38:47.667 --> 38:49.567
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

38:49.667 --> 38:51.434
YOU DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WERE DOING.

38:51.534 --> 38:53.667
BUT I DO NOW.

38:53.767 --> 38:57.834
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW
SOMETHING? I LIKE IT.

39:02.033 --> 39:03.133
HUH?

39:03.234 --> 39:05.033
SHAL!

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
DON'T HURT HER!

39:18.667 --> 39:20.200
YOU OKAY?

39:20.300 --> 39:22.367
WE NEED
TO GET ANDREA.

39:46.434 --> 39:48.200
HA!

39:48.300 --> 39:51.334
<LAUGHING> SEE? I TOLD
YOU WE COULD HAVE FUN.

39:51.434 --> 39:53.601
ANDREA. NO.

39:53.701 --> 39:57.000
SHALIMAR?

39:57.100 --> 40:00.200
GET OUT OF HERE.

40:00.300 --> 40:02.567
PLEASE.

40:02.667 --> 40:05.834
ANDREA, IT'S OVER.
JUST GIVE ME THE KNIFE.

40:05.934 --> 40:09.200
GET HIM OUT OF YOUR
HEAD - YOU CAN DO IT.

40:13.934 --> 40:16.367
GIVE ME THE KNIFE.

40:18.634 --> 40:20.634
AGH...!

41:07.767 --> 41:11.267
YOU OKAY?

41:11.367 --> 41:16.100
SHE SPENT HER
WHOLE LIFE TRYING TO SAVE PEOPLE
FROM MONSTERS LIKE MARKER.

41:16.200 --> 41:20.234
AND SHE ENDS UP BECOMING ONE.

41:20.334 --> 41:23.367
ANDREA...

41:23.467 --> 41:26.133
SHE JUST
OPENED UP THE DOOR.

41:26.234 --> 41:29.501
MARKER WALKED
RIGHT THROUGH.

41:29.601 --> 41:35.634
I NEVER SUSPECTED
HER FOR A MINUTE.

41:35.734 --> 41:41.868
THINK ABOUT IT, SHAL - SHE
CALLED YOU BECAUSE SHE KNEW THAT

41:41.968 --> 41:45.501
YOU WERE THE ONLY
ONE THAT COULD MAKE IT STOP.

41:45.601 --> 41:51.801
YEAH, WELL, AT THE
MOMENT THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ME FEEL A WHOLE LOT BETTER.

41:51.901 --> 41:55.901
SHE WAS AN AMAZING WOMAN,
AND SHE DID A LOT OF GOOD.

41:56.000 --> 42:01.400
THAT'S GONNA BE HER LEGACY.

42:01.501 --> 42:04.300
YEAH.
