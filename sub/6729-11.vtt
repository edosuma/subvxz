I don't want to do this.

01:39.685 --> 01:41.228
[Dorothy] And I don't want to cover up

01:41.311 --> 01:43.022
for a stupid starlet
who set a nightclub on fire.

01:43.105 --> 01:45.650
[young Trish] It was a tablecloth.
I don't know how it started.

01:45.733 --> 01:47.860
Because you were passed out.

01:47.943 --> 01:50.237
[young Trish] It's not the first time
that somebody's passed out.

01:50.320 --> 01:52.948
[Dorothy] And that's the headline
of every tabloid.

01:53.032 --> 01:55.660

Some photo op.
She looks dead.

She's awake sometimes.
She's just not making new memories yet.

02:29.652 --> 02:31.987
Well, you can be the one to say,
"Welcome back.

02:32.071 --> 02:34.156
By the way, your whole family's dead."

02:34.239 --> 02:36.533

[Robyn hyperventilating] I just...
I killed myself! I tried to kill myself!

03:49.106 --> 03:50.357
- It's all right, it's okay.
- Why would I do that?

03:50.440 --> 03:51.566
- It's okay.
- I hate suicide!

03:51.650 --> 03:52.902
He's gone.
It's over. It's over.

Okay, here's the lie.

04:21.805 --> 04:24.975
We're all friends.
We came here for a drink.

04:25.059 --> 04:27.061
I invited a former client
and she killed herself

04:27.144 --> 04:28.896
- and that's the end of the story.
- What?

04:28.979 --> 04:30.064
- You want me to lie?
- Okay...

04:30.147 --> 04:31.816
I can't lie!
You're the liar.

04:31.899 --> 04:34.026
- [Malcolm] Robyn, just listen to her.
- [Robyn] I'm hurt!

04:34.109 --> 04:37.029
[Jessica] If you wanna explain
your self-lynching party, go right ahead.

04:38.363 --> 04:40.783
Yeah. Right, I'll find a Dumpster
on another block.

04:40.866 --> 04:42.242
- [man 1 scoffs]
- Come on, guys.

04:42.326 --> 04:43.410
You know we can't explain this.

04:43.493 --> 04:44.912
Just help, please.

04:44.995 --> 04:46.330
We'll tell them we're in a cult.

04:46.413 --> 04:48.165
- What? No.
- At least cults are real.

04:48.248 --> 04:50.500
- One tried to recruit me once.
- [man 1] You'll get us arrested.

04:50.584 --> 04:52.294
Then we tell our truth!

04:52.377 --> 04:55.422
- For Ruben. For tablecloth girl.
- [Jessica] They're dead!

04:56.173 --> 04:58.133
And there's nothing
that I can do about that.

04:58.217 --> 05:00.260
But I can rip Kilgrave's throat out.

05:00.344 --> 05:02.762
You saw what happened,
and I'm immune to him.

05:02.847 --> 05:05.349
But those cops aren't.
They're gonna get themselves hurt.

05:05.432 --> 05:06.766
Just like we did.

05:06.851 --> 05:08.727
[Jessica] So help me get out of here

05:08.811 --> 05:10.437
so I can save them
and kill him.

05:10.520 --> 05:12.397
No matter who gets dead
along the way?

05:13.065 --> 05:14.859
It's less people than he'd kill.

05:19.738 --> 05:20.739
Those.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.244
- [sirens wailing]
- [indistinct chatter]

05:29.039 --> 05:31.208
- That 's all?
- Good, then.

05:34.503 --> 05:36.255
Talk to these guys yet?

05:37.256 --> 05:40.926
Okay, I'm gonna get a statement
from these people, all right? Okay.

05:44.429 --> 05:46.932
Step with me, ma'am,
and we'll get your statement.

05:55.232 --> 05:58.818
I came to the bar to have a drink, and...

05:58.903 --> 06:01.780
the next thing I know,
everyone just started screaming.

06:01.863 --> 06:04.074
But I didn't really see what happened.

06:04.158 --> 06:08.453
I saw it all.
Every single detail.

06:08.537 --> 06:10.789
I knew she killed her parents, but, uh...

06:12.749 --> 06:13.918
she seemed like a nice girl.

06:14.001 --> 06:19.548
She said that she wanted
some company... after everything.

06:19.631 --> 06:22.884
It's all etched into my brain. Forever.

06:22.968 --> 06:25.720
I guess what she really wanted
was an audience to watch her die.

06:25.804 --> 06:28.473
She killed herself.
With a glass.

06:28.557 --> 06:30.475
With the stem of the glass.

06:30.559 --> 06:32.602
That was her choice.
Nobody told her to do it.

06:32.686 --> 06:34.854
I guess she couldn't live with the guilt.

06:34.939 --> 06:37.774
A lot of weird shit
has been going down.

06:37.857 --> 06:39.193
How so?

06:47.867 --> 06:49.203
Well...

06:49.286 --> 06:53.623
a crazy girl walked into a bar
and jabbed a glass into her own neck.

06:53.707 --> 06:55.167
I'd call that weird.

06:57.544 --> 06:59.088
I really hate mental illness.

07:13.560 --> 07:14.644
[sighs]

07:17.689 --> 07:19.691
It made sense to me, too.

07:21.235 --> 07:22.945
What?

07:23.028 --> 07:25.447
Trading Albert for Hope.
It made sense.

07:27.116 --> 07:28.200
Well, they're dead now.

07:28.993 --> 07:31.328
- They?
- Albert's as good as dead.

07:34.498 --> 07:37.876
[sighs heavily]
Shit, I got blood on your car.

07:37.960 --> 07:39.962
Don't worry.
The car's getting used to it.

07:41.630 --> 07:43.882
- [cell phone beeps]
- [Jessica sighs]

07:43.966 --> 07:47.136
I'm gonna take you home, okay?

07:47.219 --> 07:49.596
How about Riverbank Medical Center?

07:50.722 --> 07:52.307
Right, of course,
you took a blow to the head.

07:52.391 --> 07:54.268
But Metro's closer.

07:54.351 --> 07:55.394

07:56.478 --> 07:57.937
I just got a John Doe.

07:58.022 --> 08:00.857
Police scanner app.
Could be Albert.

08:01.525 --> 08:03.860
[sighs] Right, somebody should be there
to put him to rest.

08:03.943 --> 08:06.780
Screw that.
I'm looking for leads.

08:08.198 --> 08:10.367
Where he was found,
how it was done...

08:10.450 --> 08:13.662
Anything that indicates where Kilgrave was
and where he's going.

08:13.745 --> 08:15.372
Are you going in undercover as a corpse?

08:16.956 --> 08:18.625
You're covered in blood.

08:18.708 --> 08:20.460
Well, it's a morgue.
It's not a photo shoot.

08:22.962 --> 08:24.381
[sighs]

08:24.464 --> 08:27.634
Fine, home first, then the morgue.

08:27.717 --> 08:29.011
Come on, it'll be fun.

08:40.855 --> 08:44.359
I've narrowed my search
to John Does, last 12 hours, elderly.

08:45.444 --> 08:47.362
Well, most dead bodies are old people.

08:47.446 --> 08:49.198
Since when are you the naysayer?

08:49.281 --> 08:51.283
- Just trying to keep it real.
- Great. Thanks.

08:55.745 --> 08:56.871
Hey.

08:57.456 --> 08:59.499
I'm here from
the Medical Examiner's office.

08:59.583 --> 09:00.792
- [sighs]
- There's an older male subject

09:00.875 --> 09:02.419
that I need to...

09:03.420 --> 09:04.546
examine.

09:04.629 --> 09:06.298
Your name?
I have a list.

09:06.381 --> 09:08.342
Uh, Katya Bell-Hortense.

09:10.927 --> 09:14.598
Uh, Kelly Huang. I replaced Kelly Huang.
Right there. New hire.

09:14.681 --> 09:17.476
I've had no calls authorizing
an after-hours visit.

09:18.352 --> 09:20.270
[scoffs] Are you saying
I made up Kelly Huang?

09:20.354 --> 09:22.981
Kelly Huang was a really great woman,
and she died.

09:23.065 --> 09:24.108
It was tragic.

09:24.191 --> 09:25.817
You have to leave.

09:28.278 --> 09:30.364
Okay, look, do you know who this is?

09:32.782 --> 09:33.950
Oh, this is embarrassing.

09:35.244 --> 09:36.745
This is Trish Walker.

09:36.828 --> 09:39.164
And I'm Maury Tuttlebaum.
What's your point?

09:39.248 --> 09:41.040
- He doesn't know who I am.
<i>- Trish Talk?</i>

09:41.125 --> 09:44.043

You're not on it.

Okay, thank you so much.
Let's go.

09:54.138 --> 09:55.347
[Jessica sighs]

09:55.430 --> 09:59.559
- Are you a gourmand, Maury?
- I appreciate a good meal.

10:01.060 --> 10:05.274
Trish can get you a table
at any restaurant in the city.

10:06.441 --> 10:07.442
Name it.

10:07.526 --> 10:09.068
Saterre.

10:10.445 --> 10:12.322
I had the chef on my show
when they opened.

10:12.406 --> 10:13.657
You did?

10:31.383 --> 10:34.010
You really have to try the duck confit.
It's amazing.

10:35.345 --> 10:38.640
Five minutes.
No funny business.

10:45.189 --> 10:49.151
Older male, came in an hour ago.
How'd you hear about him?

10:49.234 --> 10:52.321
Dinner at the fancy restaurant
is supposed to buy us quiet assistance.

10:52.404 --> 10:54.573
This is him. [Coughs]

10:54.656 --> 10:55.907
Weird thing.

10:57.326 --> 11:01.120
He got hit by a car and thrown.
The landing killed him.

11:01.205 --> 11:04.499
You don't see that much mid-city.
Speeds are too low.

11:04.583 --> 11:07.126
So, did he throw himself
in front of the car?

11:07.211 --> 11:09.045
I wasn't there.

11:11.047 --> 11:12.090
[Jessica sighs] God damn it.

11:15.051 --> 11:17.971
Call me if you get any more old dudes,
especially if the body's messed up.

11:18.054 --> 11:20.682
Pieces missing,
head literally shoved up the ass,

11:20.765 --> 11:22.351
knees bent backwards,
body dissolved in acid...

11:22.434 --> 11:25.229
I'll get you the chef's table at Per Se.
Thank you. Call us.

11:28.273 --> 11:31.150
[Jessica] If I can get a network of
morgue staffers to keep an eye out,

11:31.235 --> 11:32.819
maybe I'll get lucky.

11:32.902 --> 11:34.238
[Trish] It's proactive.
That's good.

11:34.321 --> 11:35.405
[Jessica] If you're just keeping it real?

11:35.489 --> 11:37.657
You're grasping at straws.

11:38.992 --> 11:41.077
I need him dead.

11:41.160 --> 11:42.203
We all do.

11:43.497 --> 11:46.875
He keeps throwing innocent people at me
and I keep falling for it.

11:46.958 --> 11:48.585
That's because you're trying
to protect them.

11:48.668 --> 11:50.920
Not anymore.
Hope died to teach me that lesson.

11:51.004 --> 11:53.172
I doubt that's what she had in mind.

11:54.758 --> 11:56.551
There's another morgue
ten blocks away.

11:56.635 --> 11:59.929
After 24 hours with no sleep,
your short-term memory goes to hell.

12:00.013 --> 12:02.432
I was unconscious last night,
so that counts.

12:02.516 --> 12:05.685
After 48 hours, there's blurred vision,
impaired judgment...

12:05.769 --> 12:07.437
I'm fine.

12:07.521 --> 12:09.063
I'm not.

12:09.147 --> 12:11.691
I have to sleep.
So do you.

12:13.485 --> 12:15.194
Yeah, you're right.

12:18.615 --> 12:21.034

15:07.534 --> 15:10.244
- Is she moving?
- Was she in the middle of the street?

15:10.328 --> 15:12.163
[old man] The truck tried
to slow down. I know, I...

15:12.246 --> 15:13.582
Put your jacket under her head.
Come on.

15:13.665 --> 15:16.167
[old man] Did somebody call the police
or something here?

15:16.250 --> 15:18.044
[woman 1] Paramedics should be
on their way.

15:18.127 --> 15:20.630
[woman 2] Here, honey.
Let me put this under your head.

15:20.714 --> 15:22.924
- Get off!
- [groaning] Ow!

15:26.135 --> 15:27.596
Are you crazy?

15:27.679 --> 15:29.138
- [man] Sit still, ma'am.
- [woman 2] She's in shock.

15:29.222 --> 15:30.306
- [grunts] I'm good.
- Take it easy.

15:30.389 --> 15:32.517
[woman 2] Ma'am,
you should really stay down.

15:32.601 --> 15:34.519
[woman 1] You really should wait
for an ambulance.

15:34.603 --> 15:36.896
Back off! I'm fine.

15:37.731 --> 15:39.190
Who pay for my truck?

15:41.234 --> 15:44.904
We've been listening to Diane Masagi
talk about her autobiography,

15:44.988 --> 15:47.866
<i>Blowing: Behind the Scenes
With a Rock Flautist.</i>

15:47.949 --> 15:51.745
And as a treat, Diane has agreed
to give us a live sample of her work.

15:51.828 --> 15:53.497
Take it away, Diane.

15:53.580 --> 15:54.998
[playing rock song]

16:01.921 --> 16:03.256
[mouths] I'll be back.

16:08.136 --> 16:10.179
What are you doing?
There's five minutes left in the show.

16:10.263 --> 16:13.016
[sighs] She's got it in her.
Just sit there and nod, okay?

16:14.308 --> 16:15.852
Thank you.

16:21.065 --> 16:23.442
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

16:23.527 --> 16:25.403
Uh, you wouldn't answer my calls.

16:25.487 --> 16:27.739
Because I don't want to talk to you.

16:27.822 --> 16:30.575
I don't blame you.
I was an asshole.

16:30.659 --> 16:33.828
Assholes are a nuisance.
I deal with them every day.

16:33.912 --> 16:37.081
- You were violent and scary.
- I know. I...

16:37.999 --> 16:39.501
I am so sorry.

16:40.418 --> 16:44.297
You know, Kozlov's drugs,
they were messing with my mind.

16:44.380 --> 16:45.632
Everything turns...

16:47.300 --> 16:48.384
red.

16:48.467 --> 16:51.470
You know, it's good for battle,
and it's bad for...

16:51.555 --> 16:52.681
people you care about.

16:54.098 --> 16:57.143
- So, I... I quit the program.
- [scoffs]

16:57.226 --> 16:58.311
Just like that?

16:58.394 --> 17:00.605
Yeah, I had to get out of there.

17:00.689 --> 17:01.940
- Some things...
- [cell phone chimes]

17:03.983 --> 17:05.984
It wasn't worth it anymore.

17:07.779 --> 17:09.531
Well, I'm happy for you.
I really am.

17:09.614 --> 17:11.657
- But I have to get back to work.
- [flute playing continues]

17:11.741 --> 17:14.242
Look, Trish, it wasn't me. I...
[sighs]

17:14.327 --> 17:16.954
Christ, even I don't buy that.
[scoffs]

17:20.165 --> 17:23.127
Look, apology accepted. Okay?

17:24.045 --> 17:26.756
- I'm in the middle of a show.
- Yeah, of course.

17:26.839 --> 17:29.968
Hey, have you seen Jessica?
'Cause I owe her an apology, too.

17:30.051 --> 17:33.137
And I wanted to say sorry in person,
but she's not home.

17:35.014 --> 17:36.766
If I see her,
I'll relay the message.

17:38.309 --> 17:40.478
Maybe I could see you later.

17:40.562 --> 17:43.690
Nothing says sorry like a rare steak
and some cheesecake.

17:43.773 --> 17:47.736
Or, you know,
tofu and wheat berries, or...

17:49.445 --> 17:51.364
Sure. Later.

18:03.001 --> 18:05.044
[flute playing continues]

18:12.176 --> 18:13.552
[Jessica grunts]

18:14.596 --> 18:15.930
[Trish sighs] Holy crap.

18:16.014 --> 18:19.558
Yeah, purple is his favorite color
and he didn't even get to give it to me.

18:20.518 --> 18:22.687
That's what they call irony.
[groans]

18:22.771 --> 18:24.939
- Sorry.
- Oh, shit.

18:25.023 --> 18:27.275
You know, I can have
a doctor here in 30 minutes.

18:27.358 --> 18:29.527
It's fine. It's just ribs.
I heal faster than most. You know that.

18:29.611 --> 18:31.613
You'll heal wrong
if you're not careful.

18:31.696 --> 18:34.115
[chuckles] Story of my life.

18:34.198 --> 18:35.909
Okay, one more.

18:40.914 --> 18:42.832
Jess, you're strong,
but even you can break.

18:42.916 --> 18:47.003
As is evident by the rib
sticking into my liver.

18:47.086 --> 18:48.838
[breathes deeply]

18:48.922 --> 18:50.799
- You want to sleep?
- No.

18:51.841 --> 18:54.427
Okay, well, just sit down, at least.
Come on.

18:54.510 --> 18:55.594
[grunts]

18:56.638 --> 18:58.640
[Trish] One...

18:58.723 --> 19:00.016
two.

19:03.102 --> 19:04.312
Thanks.

19:04.395 --> 19:06.022
[sighs heavily]

19:08.650 --> 19:11.319
- [unzips boot]
- I didn't even see the truck coming.

19:12.486 --> 19:14.155
You said.

19:15.657 --> 19:18.576
The asshole didn't even slow down,
didn't hit the brakes.

19:18.660 --> 19:20.036
No skid marks.

19:21.037 --> 19:24.582
[sighs] Humanity sucks
and they don't deserve saving.

19:24.666 --> 19:26.167
[Trish chuckles]

19:26.250 --> 19:30.504
Okay, so, if you could save
a class of first-graders or kill Kilgrave,

19:30.588 --> 19:31.673
you'd kill him?

19:31.756 --> 19:33.549
Screw 'em.

19:33.632 --> 19:36.635
- Puppies?
- Yeah, puppies never did anything for me.

19:36.720 --> 19:39.597
- All right, what about nuns?
- [scoffs] They still make those?

19:39.681 --> 19:40.974
[Trish laughs]

19:41.057 --> 19:44.560
What if he took someone you love?
Would you let 'em die?

19:44.643 --> 19:47.396
[sighs] Lucky me,
I don't have too many of those.

19:48.647 --> 19:51.359
Don't worry. I'm not just keeping you
around because you have pull

19:51.442 --> 19:53.402
- with the morgue attendants.
- [chuckles]

19:57.615 --> 19:59.283
[sighs]

19:59.367 --> 20:01.535
Still looking out for me, huh?

20:02.871 --> 20:05.248
I can protect the one
or two people I care about.

20:06.374 --> 20:07.458
"Two"?

20:07.541 --> 20:09.502
Someone I don't know about?

20:09.585 --> 20:11.129
One. Just one.

20:14.841 --> 20:16.509
Okay.

20:20.722 --> 20:23.016
Well, it's nice to be appreciated.

20:46.080 --> 20:49.625
[breathes deeply]

20:51.961 --> 20:53.504
[young Trish] <i>I'm quitting!</i>
<i>I'm quitting!</i>

20:53.587 --> 20:55.256
[Dorothy] <i>You cannot quit!</i>

20:56.299 --> 20:57.633
You are Patsy!

20:57.716 --> 20:59.177
[young Trish] I'm Trish!

20:59.260 --> 21:01.470
[Dorothy] I worked too goddamn hard
to make that name famous.

21:01.554 --> 21:03.306
[young Trish] I don't want it!
Any of it!

21:03.389 --> 21:05.892
[Dorothy] You are a spoiled brat!
People are starving,

21:05.975 --> 21:07.685
and you're complaining about
having to wear a goddamn wig!

21:07.769 --> 21:09.979
[young Trish] You're not the one
who has to wear it all the time.

21:10.063 --> 21:12.941
I'm sick of it!
I'm sick of all this Patsy shit!

21:13.024 --> 21:15.068
- If you loved me...
- [Dorothy] If I loved you?

21:15.151 --> 21:17.862
Do you know the sacrifices
that I have made?

21:17.946 --> 21:19.864
You show some respect
to your mother, Patsy!

21:19.948 --> 21:20.949
I'm not Patsy!

21:21.032 --> 21:23.326
- [Dorothy] I said shut up!
- [sighs heavily]

21:23.409 --> 21:24.660
[young Trish] Ow!

21:26.704 --> 21:28.206
- I hate you!
- [Dorothy] Patsy!

21:28.289 --> 21:31.209
- Get back here, God damn it!
- I hate you!

21:31.292 --> 21:32.919
[young Trish crying]

21:34.170 --> 21:36.714
[Dorothy] Oh, get back here, God damn it.

21:36.798 --> 21:39.342
- [young Trish sobbing]
- Sweetheart...

21:40.802 --> 21:42.971
You know, I'm only trying
to protect you.

21:43.054 --> 21:44.222
[young Trish] You're crazy.

21:46.390 --> 21:48.852
[arguing continues indistinctly]

21:48.935 --> 21:50.478
[grunting]

21:58.277 --> 22:00.154
[gasping]

22:01.865 --> 22:03.491
[young Trish] ...stay away from me!

22:04.575 --> 22:06.619
- I don't want anything to do with you.
- [gasps]

22:07.912 --> 22:09.122
How am I doing this?

22:09.663 --> 22:11.582
[Dorothy] I'm not going to punish you!

22:11.665 --> 22:13.918
- I'm just trying to help you!
- [footsteps approaching]

22:14.002 --> 22:15.879
Come back here!

22:19.257 --> 22:20.549
[grunts]

22:24.929 --> 22:27.390
[panting]

22:27.473 --> 22:28.933
What happened to your shoulder?

22:29.017 --> 22:32.853
- Are you kidding me?
- You're hurt. She hurt you.

22:32.937 --> 22:37.316
You were holding a 150-pound
chunk of marble over your head.

22:37.400 --> 22:38.526
How'd it happen?

22:40.069 --> 22:42.071
I got hit with a People's Choice Award.

22:42.155 --> 22:43.197
You?

22:44.240 --> 22:46.117
I don't know.

22:48.619 --> 22:51.289
[grunts]
You're a freak.

22:52.290 --> 22:53.958
I mean that in a positive way.

22:54.042 --> 22:56.335
Can you find a nicer word?

22:56.419 --> 22:57.503
Gifted?

22:58.546 --> 22:59.923
I guess.

23:00.006 --> 23:02.967
I broke a brush earlier, too,
but that might have been regular.

23:03.842 --> 23:05.053
I have to tell Mom.

23:05.136 --> 23:07.721
- No! God, no.
- You can't hide this.

23:07.805 --> 23:10.141
I can, and your mother
is a dangerous nutjob.

23:10.224 --> 23:11.809
She just stabbed you!

23:11.892 --> 23:14.020
And if she knew
that I had something

23:14.103 --> 23:16.355
that she could exploit, too...
No!

23:16.439 --> 23:18.357
[inhales sharply]

23:20.776 --> 23:22.320
[water running]

23:22.403 --> 23:24.405
Did the car accident cause it?

23:24.488 --> 23:26.199
I have no idea.

23:26.282 --> 23:27.325
If you tell anybody,

23:27.408 --> 23:29.953
I'm gonna tell everybody that
you're a pathetic victim of child abuse.

23:30.036 --> 23:31.912
Don't you dare.

23:31.996 --> 23:33.789
They'll make a Lifetime movie about it.

23:33.872 --> 23:36.042
<i>Stolen Childhood: The Patsy Walker Story.</i>

23:36.125 --> 23:37.501
I'd be saving you.

23:37.585 --> 23:39.920
Shut up! No!

23:40.004 --> 23:41.255
Then it's a standoff.

23:42.881 --> 23:46.970
Okay, deal.
I don't tell and you don't save me.

23:51.890 --> 23:53.892
[door shuts]

23:55.394 --> 23:58.147
[breathes deeply]

23:59.273 --> 24:00.649
[cell phone vibrating]

24:08.741 --> 24:10.034
[groans]

24:20.961 --> 24:22.588
[Jessica sighs]

24:26.134 --> 24:28.094
I'm looking for Tuttlebaum.

24:28.177 --> 24:30.471
His shift just ended.

24:30.554 --> 24:34.142
He texted me earlier
about a male subject that came in, 60s?

24:34.225 --> 24:36.852
From the old CDC building?
Place was a hazard.

24:36.935 --> 24:38.062
Wait, the CDC?

24:39.188 --> 24:40.231
Show me.

24:42.233 --> 24:44.985
You should go upstairs
and ask reception.

24:49.490 --> 24:50.824
[sighs]

25:01.502 --> 25:03.587
- [glass shattering]
- [Jessica grunts]

25:06.632 --> 25:07.966
[groaning]

25:10.303 --> 25:12.138
[groans]

25:28.279 --> 25:29.613
[sighs]

25:53.596 --> 25:54.680
[sighs]

26:02.396 --> 26:03.897
[sighs]

26:20.414 --> 26:21.832
[cell phone vibrating]

26:30.216 --> 26:32.843
Next time you collapse, try 911.

26:32.926 --> 26:34.512
<i>Clemons is dead.</i>

26:35.971 --> 26:36.972
Kilgrave?

26:37.055 --> 26:40.643
Yeah, he must've doubled back
to destroy the evidence.

26:43.437 --> 26:45.189
Maybe Clemons got in his way?

26:48.401 --> 26:51.028
He burnt everything down, Trish.

26:51.111 --> 26:52.613
Oh, Jesus.

26:52.696 --> 26:55.866
<i>Albert's body will show up eventually.
Kilgrave won't let him live.</i>

26:57.368 --> 26:59.953
I'm coming to you.
We'll hit up the rest of the morgues.

27:00.037 --> 27:01.622
Okay, meet me at my place.
Just give me an hour.

27:01.705 --> 27:02.790
<i>See you then.</i>

27:04.124 --> 27:05.376
[cell phone beeps]

27:06.585 --> 27:09.004
[grunts and inhales sharply]

27:11.799 --> 27:13.217
[door unlocks]

27:16.595 --> 27:17.763
[door locks]

27:22.560 --> 27:23.686
I'm firing my doorman.

27:23.769 --> 27:26.980
Yeah, you should.
He sleeps on the job.

27:27.064 --> 27:29.400
So, you just let yourself up?

27:29.483 --> 27:31.527
I was hoping maybe we could talk.

27:31.610 --> 27:33.321
You know, you said
I could come by later, so...

27:33.404 --> 27:35.739
Uh, later, not eight hours later.

27:35.823 --> 27:39.868
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing,
so... that's why I didn't knock.

27:42.413 --> 27:43.706
[scoffs]

27:43.789 --> 27:47.335
Go home, Simpson.
Before you fall asleep on the floor.

27:53.841 --> 27:57.970
Trish, I like you, which sounds like
I'm in fifth grade again...

27:58.053 --> 28:00.306
What I mean is, I'm...

28:00.389 --> 28:01.932
[chuckles]

28:02.015 --> 28:07.563
I just... I don't want to lose you
because of some bad medication. That's...

28:11.609 --> 28:13.277
Okay.

28:14.987 --> 28:18.699
So, uh...
you were on your way somewhere?

28:19.700 --> 28:20.743
Um...

28:20.826 --> 28:24.288
Store down the street.
I'm... I'm out of soy milk.

28:24.372 --> 28:26.164
So, you're not gonna go see Jessica?

28:26.249 --> 28:27.875
She got you doing something?

28:29.918 --> 28:33.589
See, when you ask questions like that,
I start thinking that you're off.

28:33.672 --> 28:35.132
"Off"?

28:36.884 --> 28:37.885
I should go.

28:37.968 --> 28:40.263
I... I just want to know where Jessica is.

28:40.346 --> 28:41.555
Why?

28:41.639 --> 28:43.474
My boys are dead because of her.

28:43.557 --> 28:44.850
Because of Kilgrave!

28:44.933 --> 28:47.811
Yeah, and I'm gonna-gonna kill him,
but she just keeps getting in the way.

28:47.895 --> 28:51.857
Jessica is the only one who can kill him,
which is exactly what she's trying to do.

28:51.940 --> 28:54.192
- You're the only one getting in the way!
- [elevator dings]

28:56.987 --> 28:58.614
Hey, Simpson.

28:59.698 --> 29:01.950
We'd hate to have any trouble
while your girlfriend's here.

29:02.034 --> 29:04.578
What is this?
Who the hell are you?

29:05.203 --> 29:07.665
- Doc's worried about you.
- [Simpson] Yeah?

29:07.748 --> 29:11.919
Well, tell Kozlov
I appreciate the concern,

29:12.002 --> 29:13.254
but I'm not coming back.

29:13.962 --> 29:15.213
[man chuckles]

29:15.298 --> 29:16.674
We, uh...

29:17.675 --> 29:20.469
we can't leave here without you, Simpson.

29:20.553 --> 29:21.679
Hmm.

29:23.138 --> 29:26.267
Well, please, take him. Really.
Please go.

29:26.350 --> 29:28.436
No, go back inside-inside.

29:29.478 --> 29:30.563
I got this.

29:34.024 --> 29:35.443
Don't.

29:42.575 --> 29:44.660
[man] Don't make this messy.

29:44.743 --> 29:46.912
- No one wants to hurt Patsy.
- [both chuckle]

29:47.705 --> 29:49.665
- Look, I... I think you should leave.
- [gun cocks]

29:50.666 --> 29:52.125
- [grunts]
- [screams]

29:52.710 --> 29:54.086
[grunts]

29:55.212 --> 29:56.797
[inhales deeply]

29:59.550 --> 30:00.968
[exhales]

30:02.678 --> 30:04.137
[cell phone beeps]

30:04.221 --> 30:06.599
Trish, are you
at my place already?

30:06.682 --> 30:08.726
[Simpson] <i>Sorry, it's Simpson.</i>

30:09.643 --> 30:12.145
I knew you wouldn't pick up
if it was me calling,

30:12.229 --> 30:14.022
so I stole her phone.

30:14.106 --> 30:15.399
<i>Listen, asshole...</i>

30:15.483 --> 30:19.945
Hey, relax.
She's headed to your car now to meet you.

30:20.028 --> 30:21.489
She wouldn't let me come, so...

30:22.448 --> 30:25.242
<i>Yeah, I'm a dick,
but I need your help.</i>

30:25.326 --> 30:26.369
What do you want?

30:26.452 --> 30:30.998
Well, uh, same thing as you,
or so Trish tells me.

30:31.999 --> 30:33.291
To kill Kilgrave.

30:33.376 --> 30:36.169
<i>- I got this.</i>
- Yeah, well, I got a lead.

30:37.505 --> 30:40.508
Jess, I know where he is.

30:40.591 --> 30:42.510
<i>- Where?</i>
- Uh-uh-uh.

30:42.593 --> 30:46.889
See, I want in.
My lead, I watch him die.

30:46.972 --> 30:50.183
<i>I can go catch up with Trish,
but if you're not there yet...</i>

30:51.894 --> 30:53.896
I'll be home in 30.

30:54.980 --> 30:56.023
[cell phone beeps]

30:59.276 --> 31:00.903
- [Trish] Hey!
- [pounding on door]

31:00.986 --> 31:03.739
- Can anybody hear me?
- [pounding continues]

31:03.822 --> 31:05.908
Simpson, open the door!

31:05.991 --> 31:08.076
- Help!
- [pounding continues]

31:08.160 --> 31:11.455
Trish, this is the only way
to keep you safe.

31:12.456 --> 31:14.458
Simpson, you said you wanted to talk.

31:15.626 --> 31:17.420
Let's talk.
Open the door.

31:17.503 --> 31:21.840
I'll take care of things, Trish.
It's what I do. It's what I do.

31:21.924 --> 31:23.091
[pounding on door]

31:23.175 --> 31:26.011
[Trish] Simpson! Simpson!

31:26.720 --> 31:28.346
[breathing heavily]

31:33.602 --> 31:35.062
[grunting]

31:39.525 --> 31:41.318
There you are.
Where have you been?

31:42.903 --> 31:43.946
[grunts]

31:44.029 --> 31:46.657
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

31:46.740 --> 31:48.451
We've been waiting for you.

31:49.660 --> 31:50.828
"We"?

31:50.911 --> 31:53.038
The folks with the nooses
around their necks.

31:53.121 --> 31:55.874
They want a plan,
or at least some news.

31:57.418 --> 32:00.003
Well, they're gonna have to keep waiting.

32:00.087 --> 32:02.423
Come on, I...
I gotta tell them something.

32:02.506 --> 32:04.257
- We're meeting tonight.
- [keys clatter]

32:05.718 --> 32:08.303
[Jessica sighs] Tell them to forget
it ever happened.

32:10.388 --> 32:13.350
You asked them to lie,
to let you handle it.

32:13.434 --> 32:14.477
They did.

32:14.560 --> 32:16.645
I think they deserve an update.

32:16.729 --> 32:17.771
They do.

32:19.815 --> 32:20.983
[Jessica sighs]

32:23.110 --> 32:24.903
[door locking]

32:41.462 --> 32:42.796
[groans]

32:46.467 --> 32:47.593
[sighs]

33:02.733 --> 33:04.109
[door opens]

33:17.080 --> 33:19.166
Hey, Jess.

33:19.249 --> 33:21.502
You all right?

33:21.585 --> 33:24.421
Well, what doesn't kill us
makes us stranger.

33:24.505 --> 33:25.506
Stronger.

33:25.589 --> 33:27.675
If you say so.

33:31.094 --> 33:32.220
Where's Trish?

33:32.304 --> 33:34.431
I convinced her to stay behind.

33:34.515 --> 33:35.933
She agreed.

33:37.560 --> 33:40.145
Yeah. Keep her from harm's way.

33:40.228 --> 33:43.398
Yeah, well, she's not built
for this sort of thing.

33:43.481 --> 33:47.235
She's not like us.
Her heart's too good-good.

33:49.572 --> 33:50.698
So, where's Kilgrave?

33:51.907 --> 33:54.743
Well, I need a guarantee
that he's gonna die.

33:54.827 --> 33:57.370
He sealed that deal
when he killed Clemons.

33:59.873 --> 34:02.876
- You don't look surprised.
- Well, I heard about it from the Precinct.

34:02.960 --> 34:06.755
Hmm.
He was a... great detective.

34:06.839 --> 34:08.924
- Did they say how he died?
- Fire.

34:09.007 --> 34:10.676
Still putting it out.

34:10.759 --> 34:13.637
Actually, I saw the coroner's report
and it was a bullet to the head.

34:14.763 --> 34:16.389
That's a mercy.

34:16.473 --> 34:18.308
Kilgrave must have shot him.

34:18.391 --> 34:20.936
Or had someone else shoot him.

34:21.018 --> 34:23.063
Yet another reason to kill the bastard.

34:25.690 --> 34:28.400
Actually, I hacked a file from the cops,

34:28.485 --> 34:31.947
and ballistics show
the bullet was police issue.

34:33.281 --> 34:35.993
He forced a cop to shoot him.

34:38.120 --> 34:39.371
Bullshit.

34:40.330 --> 34:42.666
There's no way ballistics
came back that fast.

34:42.750 --> 34:44.251
Yeah, you're right.
I took a flyer.

34:46.503 --> 34:49.840
So... you think I shot Clemons?

34:50.757 --> 34:53.301
You knew where
to find Trish at Albert's hotel.

34:53.385 --> 34:55.178
Only Clemons and I knew she was there.

34:55.262 --> 34:58.223
- [scoffs]
- Which means you went to the CDC first.

34:58.306 --> 35:00.433
And that fresh burn
on your arm confirms it.

35:05.522 --> 35:06.774
[inhales deeply]

35:07.858 --> 35:09.317
I didn't even feel that.

35:18.076 --> 35:19.286
- [grunts]
- Tell me you're Kilgraved.

35:19.369 --> 35:21.329
Clemons was gonna put him in the system.

35:22.039 --> 35:23.123
[straining]

35:24.374 --> 35:25.626
[grunts]

35:33.717 --> 35:35.052
You piece of shit!

35:35.135 --> 35:36.344
[both grunting]

35:42.935 --> 35:43.977
[gun clicking]

35:52.986 --> 35:54.612
[groaning]

36:00.285 --> 36:01.662
What the hell are those?

36:02.370 --> 36:03.455
[intensely exhales]

36:08.043 --> 36:09.461
[groaning]

36:10.128 --> 36:11.755
You're done protecting him.

36:13.215 --> 36:15.592
I am trying to kill him.

36:15.676 --> 36:17.302
You're lying.

36:20.555 --> 36:22.349
- [glass shattering]
- [Jessica grunts]

36:22.975 --> 36:25.728
Any other day,
you would've won this.

36:30.023 --> 36:33.068
[breathing heavily]
It's your ribs, isn't it?

36:35.988 --> 36:38.448
You're on something.
You're messed up.

36:38.531 --> 36:42.410
- You could have killed him a dozen times.
- [grunting]

36:42.494 --> 36:45.205
- Now I'm just doing what has to be done.
- [choking]

36:45.288 --> 36:46.832
Someone has to.

36:48.917 --> 36:51.294
- [grunts]
- Out of my way!

36:58.051 --> 37:00.095
Go, go, go, go, go!

37:04.725 --> 37:05.851
[bangs door]

37:07.936 --> 37:09.146
[Jessica] What the hell is he taking?

37:09.229 --> 37:11.648
I don't know.
Some kind of combat enhancement.

37:11.732 --> 37:13.441
- Increases adrenaline or something.
- [pounding on door]

37:13.525 --> 37:14.526
- Did you know about this?
- [panting]

37:14.609 --> 37:16.236
I didn't know the extent of it.

37:19.322 --> 37:21.992
I can't beat him, Trish.
I'm too hurt.

37:23.701 --> 37:26.204
I only want Jessica.
You can still leave, Trish.

37:26.288 --> 37:28.290
Yeah, you can still screw yourself!

37:30.667 --> 37:32.460
[breathing heavily]

37:38.008 --> 37:40.635
- Tell me those aren't his pills.
- If it works for him...

37:49.812 --> 37:51.188
You stole my pills.

37:51.271 --> 37:53.398
No, don't!
It'll kill you.

37:53.481 --> 37:56.193
- Hasn't killed you.
- Trish, you have no tolerance.

37:56.276 --> 37:57.569
You see these?

37:58.653 --> 37:59.737
Without a blue to come down,

37:59.822 --> 38:02.324
your brain will forget
to tell your lungs to breathe.

38:04.201 --> 38:06.328
I won't need a blue for another ten hours.

38:06.411 --> 38:08.621
- Give it to me.
- No, no, if it kills you,

38:08.705 --> 38:10.582
there's nobody to take out Kilgrave.

38:13.626 --> 38:15.838
- No, don't!
- Without the blues, you'll die!

38:21.885 --> 38:23.511
[grunts]

38:27.599 --> 38:28.600
Worth it.

38:31.686 --> 38:32.813
[grunting]

38:43.073 --> 38:44.867
I'm not trying to hurt you.

38:47.744 --> 38:49.246
[groaning]

39:09.349 --> 39:10.642
[sighs]

39:15.813 --> 39:17.399
Is he dead?

39:18.316 --> 39:20.568
- I don't know.
- [breathing heavily]

39:21.444 --> 39:23.613
Jesus, that was amazing!

39:25.866 --> 39:26.867
Are you okay?

39:26.950 --> 39:29.286
Are you kidding me?
I'm pumped!

39:33.540 --> 39:35.000
Is this what it's like for you?

39:35.667 --> 39:36.709
Like, all the time?

39:37.794 --> 39:39.296
Trish, why don't you
slow down for a minute?

39:39.379 --> 39:41.714
I can't!
I'm too psyched!

39:41.798 --> 39:42.925
I'm too...

39:44.551 --> 39:45.718
[gagging] I'm too...

39:47.137 --> 39:48.513
[panting]

39:48.596 --> 39:50.765
- Trish, say something.
- I can't...

39:51.808 --> 39:52.809
Trish...

39:52.893 --> 39:54.769
[gasping for air]

39:54.852 --> 39:57.605
Oh, my God! Trish!
Trish, don't...

39:57.689 --> 39:59.399
Trish, don't do this.

39:59.482 --> 40:00.692
- Trish, are you okay? Trish?
- [choking]

40:00.775 --> 40:03.195
Trish, breathe! Trish!

40:04.237 --> 40:05.906
[dialing]

40:05.989 --> 40:08.491
I need an ambulance right away.

40:08.575 --> 40:12.079
485 West 46th Street,
5th floor. Hurry!

40:12.162 --> 40:15.999
Trish, they're on their way.
Trish, Trish, don't do this.

40:16.083 --> 40:17.875
[shouts] Trish!

40:24.257 --> 40:25.675
[young Trish crying]

40:28.845 --> 40:30.347
[clattering]

40:30.430 --> 40:32.349
[young Trish] Stop it! Stop!

40:32.432 --> 40:34.434
- [Dorothy] Come on.
- [young Trish] No, I don't wanna do this.

40:34.517 --> 40:37.645
- [Dorothy] Come on. Come on.
- No, I don't wanna do this.

40:37.729 --> 40:39.231
Well, you shouldn't have eaten
all that pizza.

40:39.314 --> 40:41.691
- Then we wouldn't have to do this.
- [young Trish] Stop it!

40:41.774 --> 40:43.944
The camera adds ten pounds.
You know that.

40:44.027 --> 40:46.446
- [young Trish grunts]
- You want them to call you Fatsy?

40:46.529 --> 40:47.572
Stop it!

40:48.781 --> 40:50.200
Get out!

40:50.283 --> 40:53.120
- This is private.
- Let her go.

40:53.203 --> 40:54.496
Jess, get out.

40:56.914 --> 40:58.916
This is family business.

40:59.001 --> 41:00.585
You're not part of any family.

41:00.668 --> 41:02.795
You promised not to save me.

41:02.879 --> 41:04.339
I can't help it.

41:05.090 --> 41:06.341
[grunts]

41:08.426 --> 41:09.677
[Dorothy] Ow!

41:11.763 --> 41:13.306
[shuddered breathing]

41:14.307 --> 41:15.808
Dear God in heaven.

41:23.275 --> 41:24.692
Now she knows.

41:25.360 --> 41:26.778
Good.

41:27.737 --> 41:28.946
- [siren wailing]
- [EKG beeping]

41:29.031 --> 41:31.199
- [male EMT] What did she take?
- [Jessica] I don't know.

41:31.283 --> 41:33.410
- Coke? Meth?
- No, God, no. Nothing like that.

41:33.493 --> 41:35.953
You're not helping her
by not telling me what she took.

41:36.038 --> 41:38.040
Uh, she said it was a combat drug.

41:38.123 --> 41:40.708
Something to increase adrenaline,
numbs pain.

41:40.792 --> 41:41.876
[male EMT] That's a new one.

41:41.959 --> 41:43.503
[Jessica] Trish.

41:43.586 --> 41:45.588
- Trish.
- [EKG beeping rapidly]

41:45.672 --> 41:47.132
[male EMT] Damn it. We're losing her.

41:47.215 --> 41:48.383
[EKG flatlining]

41:48.466 --> 41:49.676
Trish.

41:49.759 --> 41:51.094
Trish.

41:52.220 --> 41:54.347
- What is that?
- Sure it was a stimulant?

41:54.431 --> 41:56.266
Yeah, yes, yeah.

41:56.349 --> 41:58.268
Yes, just do it.

41:58.351 --> 42:00.395
Drive faster!

42:00.478 --> 42:02.522
[softly] Trish...
Trish, come on.

42:03.731 --> 42:07.194
Trish, please.
Please, please, please, please.

42:07.277 --> 42:09.362
- [EKG stops]
- Trish.

42:12.199 --> 42:14.201
- [beeping]
- [gasps]

42:14.284 --> 42:15.410
Trish.

42:15.493 --> 42:17.829
- Oh, my God, Trish.
- [gasping]

42:18.871 --> 42:20.040
Are you all right?

42:20.123 --> 42:22.625
Is she gonna be okay?
Trish.

42:23.626 --> 42:24.794
Trish!

42:27.214 --> 42:28.423
God damn you.

42:29.049 --> 42:30.133
[chuckles softly]

42:32.677 --> 42:33.845
[Jessica sighs]

42:38.308 --> 42:40.352
Just had to be a hero, didn't you?

42:41.353 --> 42:43.688
- I learned it from you.
- [chuckles]

42:55.408 --> 42:56.701
[Robyn] They're not coming.

42:58.620 --> 42:59.662
[Malcolm] How do you know?

42:59.746 --> 43:03.541
[Robyn] Because I'm not delusional.
The group is done.

43:03.625 --> 43:06.836
- [Malcolm] You came.
- To warn you.

43:06.919 --> 43:10.840
Stop group-texting your location
to a bunch of strangers.

43:10.923 --> 43:14.219
Any one of them could be brainwashed
to gouge your eyes out.

43:14.302 --> 43:17.222
That's... that's not how Kilgrave works.

43:17.305 --> 43:19.974
Well, I'm sorry, are you
a professor of Kilgravism?

43:21.101 --> 43:23.395
Starting to think so. [Sighs]

43:23.478 --> 43:25.688
Well, it's gonna get us all killed.

43:27.982 --> 43:30.110
Jesus, what is it with people?

43:30.818 --> 43:36.032
At best, they're assholes.
At worst, they're... zombie assassins.

43:36.116 --> 43:40.245
So what, it's just every man
for himself, then, huh?

43:41.746 --> 43:43.373
Everything I learned in church,

43:43.456 --> 43:46.751
all the praying that my mom did
for the sick and the dying, all the...

43:46.834 --> 43:48.920
all the community projects
my dad worked on,

43:49.003 --> 43:52.174
basically, everything that
they taught me...

43:52.257 --> 43:53.800
it was all bullshit?

43:54.551 --> 43:58.346
They're idiots and I'm just the only
asshole in the world who didn't know?

43:59.181 --> 44:01.849
Yeah, you got duped, mop top.

44:01.933 --> 44:05.603
I thought me and Ruben
were stronger together than alone.

44:05.687 --> 44:09.065
But he still got sliced up
and thrown out anyway.

44:09.149 --> 44:11.359
No one can help anyone.

44:15.029 --> 44:16.948
If I believe that, I'll kill myself.

44:23.538 --> 44:25.665
Well, there's a noose
in a Dumpster somewhere.

44:26.958 --> 44:28.543
No one's gonna stop you this time.

45:22.597 --> 45:24.140
[door opens]

45:35.860 --> 45:38.112
[woman] Got him.

45:38.195 --> 45:39.656
[man] Apartment's clear.

45:50.833 --> 45:51.876
Take him.

45:58.383 --> 45:59.592
[elevator bell dings]

46:11.438 --> 46:13.147
[rustling]

46:16.443 --> 46:17.860
[typing on phone]

46:27.495 --> 46:29.456
[rustling continues]

46:39.341 --> 46:40.550
[keys jangling]

46:42.093 --> 46:43.886
[door unlocking]

46:57.734 --> 47:00.152
- [cell phone vibrating]
- [sighs]

47:04.532 --> 47:06.200
[cell phone vibrates]

48:01.506 --> 48:02.507
[sighs]

48:09.931 --> 48:11.223
Luke!

48:21.443 --> 48:23.778
[siren wailing in distance]

48:45.424 --> 48:47.426
[dramatic music playing]

48:48.305 --> 48:54.159
