WEBVTT

00:02.035 --> 00:03.070
(sighs)

00:05.739 --> 00:07.074
Welcome back, Kevin.

00:07.074 --> 00:09.042
FYI, it's sample day.

00:09.042 --> 00:11.111
The conference room
is humming with pudding
right now.

00:11.111 --> 00:13.013
-Nice.
-Mm-hmm.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.114
Good to be back.

00:14.114 --> 00:16.250
Oh! Only one per employee.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.352
-You already had yours.
-Oh.

00:18.352 --> 00:21.221
I thought with your
head injury, your system
couldn't handle pudding.

00:21.221 --> 00:22.322
You can get yours, Audrey.

00:22.322 --> 00:24.458
Banana's the best.
Kevin had that.

00:24.458 --> 00:27.194
No thanks, Ricky.
I'm not in the mood today.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.364
Hey, what's her deal?

00:30.364 --> 00:31.398
She hasn't even looked at me.

00:31.398 --> 00:33.133
Is she upset that
I'm looking for another job?

00:33.133 --> 00:34.601
I assume that you told her
as well.

00:34.601 --> 00:36.036
Yes, I did.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.237
But no, she doesn't care.

00:37.237 --> 00:38.305
Oh.

00:38.305 --> 00:40.307
She's upset
for a mystery reason.

00:40.307 --> 00:42.376
But my network
is all over it.

00:42.376 --> 00:45.579
<i>Shondra said that yesterday</i>
<i>Audrey was really happy,</i>

00:45.579 --> 00:48.081
<i>and she had a new manicure</i>
<i>and haircut.</i>

00:48.081 --> 00:49.316
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

00:49.316 --> 00:50.450
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

00:52.519 --> 00:54.755
That's it?
That's the whole thing?
No details?

00:54.755 --> 00:57.691
She got it done
at the pricey place in Encino

00:57.691 --> 00:59.993
by the guy who looks like
Pax Jolie-Pitt.

00:59.993 --> 01:01.461
Okay.

01:01.461 --> 01:03.664
And yesterday,
Ned said he saw her
speaking on the phone

01:03.664 --> 01:05.465
<i>in a very animated fashion.</i>

01:06.733 --> 01:08.235
<i>And yet, this morning,</i>

01:08.235 --> 01:11.471
<i>She came off the elevator</i>
<i>and was hardly cheery.</i>

01:11.471 --> 01:13.440
It's gonna be
a hot one today.

01:13.440 --> 01:16.376
If one more person says that
to me, I'm going to smash
their face in the copier!

01:16.376 --> 01:20.280
And Alice said she threw
a small silver object in
her top drawer yesterday.

01:20.280 --> 01:21.548
Unclear what it was,

01:21.548 --> 01:23.283
but I'm guessing oyster fork.

01:23.283 --> 01:26.386
Okay, so we've got
a secret silver object,

01:26.386 --> 01:29.623
a good mood, a bad mood,
and a haircut.

01:29.623 --> 01:32.225
It's very clear
what's going on here.

01:32.225 --> 01:33.994
What?

01:33.994 --> 01:36.363
I have no idea.
You've given me nothing.

01:36.363 --> 01:37.664
-(theme music plays)
-(scoffs)

01:37.664 --> 01:40.167
<i>♪ Because it's all good ♪</i>

01:40.167 --> 01:42.102
<i>♪ It's all, all,</i>
<i>it's all good ♪</i>

01:42.102 --> 01:44.404
<i>♪ Uh-huh, yup,</i>
<i>it's all good ♪</i>

01:44.404 --> 01:46.707
<i>♪ Uh-huh, uh-huh,</i>
<i>it's all good ♪</i>

01:48.208 --> 01:49.576
<i>♪ Because it's all good ♪</i>

01:49.576 --> 01:51.712
<i>♪ It's all, all,</i>
<i>it's all good ♪</i>

01:51.712 --> 01:54.247
<i>♪ Uh-huh, yup,</i>
<i>it's all good ♪</i>

01:57.084 --> 01:59.319
Something's up
with Audrey and Brock.

01:59.319 --> 02:01.088
I was snooping around
her desk the other day,

02:01.088 --> 02:03.190
<i>and found something</i>
<i>very interesting.</i>

02:03.190 --> 02:06.493
<i>Ooh, a pregnancy test with</i>
<i>a plus, like, really clear?</i>

02:06.493 --> 02:08.362
<i>No, a mystery ring.</i>

02:08.362 --> 02:10.297
<i>Two dolphins</i>
<i>touching noses.</i>

02:10.297 --> 02:12.232
<i>But Ricky thinks</i>
<i>it's way more than that.</i>

02:12.232 --> 02:14.534
The dolphins may say
swimming in paradise,

02:14.534 --> 02:16.737
but her behavior says
trouble in paradise.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.572
Maybe I should
make a move?

02:18.572 --> 02:20.240
Jeez, do you never learn?

02:20.240 --> 02:23.343
I mean, you've had endless
humiliation with this girl
starting with that letter,

02:23.343 --> 02:26.213
and now what's the latest
thing? You pull her away
from a moving car?

02:26.213 --> 02:29.316
God, if you can't get a girl
to like you after that,
I don't know what to tell you.

02:29.316 --> 02:30.417
Move on to men, maybe?

02:30.417 --> 02:31.752
I don't know,
I'll keep thinking.

02:31.752 --> 02:34.521
Well, I'm gearing up my body
for the move to Italy.

02:34.521 --> 02:37.758
Woke up 15 minutes ago
and a full-bodied Chianti
is about to be my breakfast.

02:37.758 --> 02:40.427
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves. I might
have a reason to stay.

02:40.427 --> 02:42.496
-What?
-Yeah, Audrey.
He's back on it.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.364
Ooh, you should join
a cult!

02:44.364 --> 02:46.199
I mean, you have to share
women, but some's better
than none, right?

02:46.199 --> 02:48.168
Wait a minute,
I thought we were
as good as gone?

02:48.168 --> 02:50.203
I mean, I looked into
housing already.

02:50.203 --> 02:51.672
When you say
"looked into..."

02:51.672 --> 02:54.207
Yeah, like, I...
put the deposit down.

02:54.207 --> 02:56.343
It's an old bell tower,
you know?

02:56.343 --> 02:58.512
I figured that you and I
would have a blast ringing
that sucker, so...

02:58.512 --> 03:01.615
Guys, I have been offered
the job in Italy, yes,

03:01.615 --> 03:03.550
but I haven't
taken it yet.

03:03.550 --> 03:07.254
I bet I can buy a couple
of days before I have
to officially accept it or not.

03:07.254 --> 03:08.221
So, you know,

03:08.221 --> 03:10.323
maybe I mysteriously
lost my passport?

03:10.323 --> 03:13.160
Wait a minute,
I thought Audrey wasn't
even talking to you?

03:13.160 --> 03:14.561
For some reason...

03:14.561 --> 03:16.396
Stay away from my brother.

03:18.498 --> 03:20.300
So Audrey did
come to the hospital.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.369
How did you know
about that?

03:22.369 --> 03:25.238
Oh, I thought
you were Kevin.

03:25.238 --> 03:29.076
No, no. No, no.
I'm just here to pick up
his homework.

03:29.076 --> 03:31.311
Well, his work
to do at home.

03:31.311 --> 03:33.280
It's not called homework.
I know that.

03:33.280 --> 03:36.149
Um, is there
a guidance counselor
I can ask about this?

03:36.149 --> 03:37.384
How is he?

03:37.384 --> 03:39.186
I assume it's okay
to ask you.

03:39.186 --> 03:42.322
Roxie only threatened me
about not talking to Kevin.

03:42.322 --> 03:43.390
Hmm?

03:43.390 --> 03:45.192
She has a boyfriend, Kevin.

03:45.192 --> 03:46.593
I told her to stop
messing with you,

03:46.593 --> 03:48.628
because nobody mistreats
my brother but me.

03:48.628 --> 03:51.465
She cared that I was hurt.
This-- this-- this is huge!

03:51.465 --> 03:53.467
I mean, and now
there's potential
trouble with Brock?

03:53.467 --> 03:56.403
I should definitely
be making a move.
Brian, what do you think?

03:56.403 --> 03:59.473
I... I was actually really
looking forward to moving
to Italy.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.274
But, this is huge for you.

04:01.274 --> 04:04.377
And it kind makes living
in a bell tower look
a little silly.

04:04.377 --> 04:06.079
It looked a little
silly anyway.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.448
But I know, I'm just
trying to justify
the hasty deposit, Kev.

04:08.448 --> 04:10.016
But you got my back on this?

04:10.016 --> 04:11.518
If I have a shot,
I need to take it now.

04:11.518 --> 04:13.587
Man, you know I'm always
Team Kevin.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.022
Okay, okay, stop, stop!
This is crazy. Okay?

04:16.022 --> 04:17.424
I won't let
you make a move

04:17.424 --> 04:19.626
until we know
for a fact what's going on
with Audrey and Brock

04:19.626 --> 04:23.363
if you want to keep
that little bit of micro-pride
that you have left.

04:23.363 --> 04:24.531
So, you really wanna do this?

04:26.399 --> 04:27.434
I have to.

04:29.302 --> 04:30.403
Okay.

04:30.403 --> 04:32.506
Well, you know,
I'm Team Kevin, too.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.407
Can I get a "K"?

04:34.407 --> 04:35.442
-K.
-K.

04:35.442 --> 04:36.443
Can I get a "E"?

04:36.443 --> 04:37.477
-E.
-E.

04:37.477 --> 04:38.645
-Can I get a V--
-Okay.

04:38.645 --> 04:40.280
It's "Kevin."
We know how it ends.

04:43.550 --> 04:46.486
Daddy, this restaurant
is sublime.

04:46.486 --> 04:48.755
Thank you for inviting me.
I can see why it's
your favorite.

04:48.755 --> 04:50.257
Of course, sweetheart.

04:50.257 --> 04:52.492
-Now--
-And you look faboo.

04:52.492 --> 04:56.029
Now, Patti, I want to talk
to you about something serious.

04:56.029 --> 04:58.064
Anyway, I think I'm gonna
get mine to go.

04:58.064 --> 04:59.132
Excuse me.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.301
Patti, sit.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.370
I'm concerned about you.

05:03.370 --> 05:07.207
You're living your life like
that crazy pear-shaped girl
who's always naked on HBO.

05:08.375 --> 05:11.444
I want you
to embrace adulthood.
I want you...

05:11.444 --> 05:14.114
to get a job.
Something you love.

05:14.114 --> 05:18.318
But what can I do that involves
long scented baths, shopping,
"Real Housewives," and tapas?

05:18.318 --> 05:19.986
I don't know.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.388
But, if you don't do
as I ask,

05:21.388 --> 05:22.455
-I'll be forced to cut...
-Don't.

05:22.455 --> 05:23.723
-...you off.
-Don't. Don't.

05:23.723 --> 05:25.425
Don't!

05:25.425 --> 05:28.261
I'm sorry, sweetheart,
but it's for your own good.

05:35.468 --> 05:37.404
Oh, Kev,
you're finally home.

05:37.404 --> 05:40.240
Team Kevin has this
so under control,
it is not even funny.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.342
Yeah, nothing funny
about this.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.643
No, it's cool, huh?

05:43.643 --> 05:45.278
I got the idea from my show.

05:45.278 --> 05:47.380
We always uncover a setup
like this when we catch
a stalker.

05:47.380 --> 05:49.583
Not that we're
calling you a stalker.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.351
Right. Because I'm not.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.253
Because you guys
put this together, not me.

05:53.253 --> 05:56.389
Oh, look, she got takeout,
and then she recycled
the containers.

05:56.389 --> 05:58.225
You can tell
'cause it's the same containers.

05:59.392 --> 06:01.194
Okay, um...

06:01.194 --> 06:04.364
So, later, I'm gonna meet
with Brock, Roxie's gonna
meet with Audrey,

06:04.364 --> 06:05.532
we're gonna report back
what we learned.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.100
Right, in the meantime,

06:07.100 --> 06:09.269
I am going to hold off
the Italians

06:09.269 --> 06:12.239
until I have enough info
to either stay or go.

06:12.239 --> 06:15.108
Don't worry, Kevin.
We're gonna figure out
what's going on with your girl.

06:15.108 --> 06:16.142
Yeah.

06:16.142 --> 06:18.245
"My girl."

06:18.245 --> 06:20.313
I could get used
to the sound of that.

06:20.313 --> 06:23.283
The stalkers on our show
always say the same thing.

06:23.283 --> 06:24.384
Yeah, but not as creepy.

06:29.456 --> 06:31.157
Thanks for coming here.

06:31.157 --> 06:33.393
I just need to take my mind
off getting a job.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.761
Well, this is the place
to feel better.

06:34.761 --> 06:37.197
There's always someone
worse off than you
at the mall.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.366
I know, people here
look so sad.

06:39.366 --> 06:42.502
Like, they're dead and going
to heaven in slo-mo
on the escalator.

06:42.502 --> 06:45.138
(laughing)

06:46.306 --> 06:50.110
Oh, god, send that one
to the down escalator.

06:50.110 --> 06:51.645
Excuse me,
can I help you?

06:51.645 --> 06:55.515
No way. You'll turn me into
the ghost of Christmas 1985.

06:55.515 --> 06:56.750
What is that eye shadow?

06:56.750 --> 06:58.485
She said it was retro chic?

06:58.485 --> 07:01.421
It's retro
making my skin crawl.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.758
And the monkey in <i>Lion King</i>
has a more skilled hand
at applying it.

07:04.758 --> 07:07.127
Here. Move, sister.

07:07.127 --> 07:09.462
You have a beautiful face.

07:09.462 --> 07:11.998
But we need to emphasize
the "wow" aspects,

07:11.998 --> 07:14.367
and hide
the "whoa" aspects.

07:14.367 --> 07:15.535
What are you doing?

07:15.535 --> 07:18.204
Everything you
couldn't, sunshine.

07:18.204 --> 07:21.474
You're basically translucent,
so we need to add some color
to your skin.

07:21.474 --> 07:22.976
You're like see-through,

07:22.976 --> 07:25.478
like a Ziploc bag with eyes.

07:25.478 --> 07:28.648
Like, I almost didn't see you.
It was just eyes and teeth.

07:28.648 --> 07:31.217
Like an ice cube,
but like, not as dark.

07:31.217 --> 07:32.619
Yes. Yes.

07:32.619 --> 07:35.221
Excuse me,
you don't work here.

07:35.221 --> 07:37.290
No, I'm just letting
off some steam

07:37.290 --> 07:39.526
and trying to prevent
the mental breakdown
of this woman.

07:39.526 --> 07:41.461
With some contouring
and some neutrals,

07:41.461 --> 07:43.563
I'll make her
human again.

07:43.563 --> 07:46.466
Do you want
to work here?

07:46.466 --> 07:48.568
"Want" is a strong word,

07:48.568 --> 07:49.502
but I'll take it.

07:49.502 --> 07:50.704
(gasps)

07:54.341 --> 07:55.375
Hey, fellas.

07:55.375 --> 07:56.743
Um, I'm Brian.

07:56.743 --> 07:58.311
Um, I'm interested
in joining your group

07:58.311 --> 08:01.614
as I too, practice in
the ancient martial art
of jiu-jitsu.

08:01.614 --> 08:04.417
Welcome. You're just
in time to grab a partner.

08:04.417 --> 08:07.354
We're working on
under-arm collar chokes.

08:07.354 --> 08:08.621
That's awesome.

08:10.223 --> 08:12.392
I'mma join him.

08:12.392 --> 08:13.593
I pick the blue pill.

08:13.593 --> 08:15.562
All right, man, go.

08:15.562 --> 08:17.364
You better get
outta here, man.

08:17.364 --> 08:19.632
Ooh, I'll matrix
the hell outta you.

08:19.632 --> 08:21.401
Hey, I'm Brian, what's up?

08:21.401 --> 08:23.470
Brock.

08:23.470 --> 08:24.971
Nothing.

08:24.971 --> 08:26.539
Cool, I hear you.

08:26.539 --> 08:28.608
So, how's it going
with the ladies?

08:28.608 --> 08:29.976
It's going.

08:29.976 --> 08:31.177
Say no more.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.212
(whistle blows)

08:32.212 --> 08:33.480
Or say more.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.482
(grunting)

08:35.482 --> 08:38.084
Oh, no. Are we really
doing this?

08:38.084 --> 08:39.986
-Yeah.
-Ah, damn.

08:39.986 --> 08:42.389
I just wanna apologize
for getting involved

08:42.389 --> 08:43.990
where I shouldn't have
at the hospital.

08:43.990 --> 08:46.459
You know, it was none
of my business, and I was harsh.

08:46.459 --> 08:47.627
Thank you.

08:47.627 --> 08:50.430
But actually,
I thought about it a lot.

08:50.430 --> 08:54.534
And maybe I...
have been flirting
with Kevin.

08:54.534 --> 08:58.071
I guess, I like the attention,
I'm embarrassed to say.

08:58.071 --> 09:01.174
Girl, wanting attention
is not embarrassing.

09:01.174 --> 09:02.675
Not getting it is.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.582
Have you not been getting
attention from your boyfriend?

09:09.582 --> 09:10.583
It's complicated.

09:10.583 --> 09:12.485
Oh, girl,
you should talk to me about it,

09:12.485 --> 09:14.320
because when it comes to men,

09:14.320 --> 09:17.257
my specialty is
complicated situations.

09:17.257 --> 09:20.160
A lost passport is
a complicated situation,
I'm afraid.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.528
Take as long as you want.

09:21.528 --> 09:24.297
I mean, I don't even mind
if I have to call the people
who hired me

09:24.297 --> 09:26.666
and tell them that I need
a little more time to get
everything in order.

09:26.666 --> 09:28.535
Sounds like you don't
want to go?

09:28.535 --> 09:30.737
I don't know.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.272
It's about a girl.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.275
-Are you okay, honey?
-Are you okay, man?

09:35.275 --> 09:39.112
Oh, it seems unfair that a man
gets to use his feet like that,
I gotta say.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.147
-(grunting)
-Come on, brother.

09:41.147 --> 09:42.549
You want a Power-Quench?

09:42.549 --> 09:44.751
I think they sell
the red kind, and the blue kind.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.653
And the orange kind!

09:46.653 --> 09:48.254
-Nah, I'm good.
-Okay.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.489
Great.

09:52.058 --> 09:53.693
Are you good, though?
I mean...

09:53.693 --> 09:56.629
You know, you seem like
you got a lot of anger in you.

09:56.629 --> 09:58.431
It's probably related
to that girl though, huh?

09:59.466 --> 10:01.134
Not again!

10:01.134 --> 10:04.003
Maybe I've matured out
of our college relationship,

10:04.003 --> 10:05.405
and Brock hasn't.

10:05.405 --> 10:06.639
God, I...

10:06.639 --> 10:08.174
Both: Can't believe
I'm telling you all this.

10:08.174 --> 10:10.276
No, we're glad
you are, honey.

10:10.276 --> 10:12.512
We haven't had
a romantic story pass
through here

10:12.512 --> 10:13.580
-in forever.
-Forever

10:13.580 --> 10:15.315
was never meant
to be with Brock.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.450
I need someone who brings
something more to the table.

10:17.450 --> 10:20.453
Someone who gets me.
It was good I did what
I did, right?

10:20.453 --> 10:22.188
Why? Wait,
what did you do?

10:23.656 --> 10:25.225
We're on a break.

10:25.225 --> 10:26.626
(both gasp)

10:27.727 --> 10:31.197
A couple days ago,
Brock told me he had something
special planned.

10:31.197 --> 10:33.733
I thought we were going
to my favorite place he never
wants to go to.

10:33.733 --> 10:35.568
-Which is?
-The bluffs at the beach.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.070
Which beach?
Which bluffs?

10:37.070 --> 10:39.372
The hidden ones
off Temescal by the cliffs.

10:39.372 --> 10:42.742
You can see forever from there,
and just think about stuff.

10:42.742 --> 10:45.645
I thought he was planning
something special, but...

10:45.645 --> 10:48.181
Thanks for walking
to the store with me.

10:48.181 --> 10:50.617
I didn't realize I was low on
whey powder and protein powder.

10:50.617 --> 10:53.686
(accordion music plays)

10:55.388 --> 10:57.624
-Babe?
-Uh-huh?

10:57.624 --> 10:59.459
Oh, my god...

10:59.459 --> 11:02.095
Are you getting down
on one knee right now?

11:02.095 --> 11:03.630
Not for this.

11:06.432 --> 11:07.634
It was a promise ring.

11:07.634 --> 11:09.002
-Oof.
-And before that,

11:09.002 --> 11:11.304
I got
a "we're exclusive" bracelet.

11:11.304 --> 11:14.174
And before that, one of
those heart necklaces
in two pieces

11:14.174 --> 11:15.308
where each person
wears one.

11:15.308 --> 11:16.743
"True love"?

11:16.743 --> 11:18.044
"Best friends."

11:18.044 --> 11:19.612
-Oof.
-Yeah.

11:19.612 --> 11:23.516
I just thought I would
be planning my wedding by now.

11:23.516 --> 11:26.319
But, I guess it's time
to wake up and realize

11:26.319 --> 11:28.621
he's never going to make
the commitment I want.

11:31.357 --> 11:32.659
(sighs)

11:32.659 --> 11:34.627
I need to move on.

11:34.627 --> 11:37.697
Oh, that's okay, baby girl.
Come here.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.968
So, really, I'm just
a nice guy

11:41.968 --> 11:44.103
who wants to come out
on top for once.

11:44.103 --> 11:45.738
(women sighing)

11:45.738 --> 11:47.207
(phone dings)

11:50.076 --> 11:51.744
Oh, my god.

11:51.744 --> 11:55.148
She finally broke up
with her dumb boyfriend.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.716
(laughs)

11:56.716 --> 11:58.751
I gotta go pick up
my friend Brian and get
this baby rolling!

11:58.751 --> 12:01.754
Rip up those forms, Fran!
It was all a fake!

12:01.754 --> 12:04.023
I don't even need
a passport anymore!

12:04.023 --> 12:07.660
Well, normally,
deception is frowned upon
at the passport office,

12:07.660 --> 12:10.296
but, good luck,
Kevin Reese Daily,
good luck!

12:10.296 --> 12:13.733
Okay, girlfriend,
we are about to take off,

12:13.733 --> 12:16.202
time to check those bags.

12:16.202 --> 12:18.304
Loves it.

12:18.304 --> 12:21.574
Ladies, I'm afraid we're
finished for the evening.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.677
Please bring your basic faces
back tomorrow at 9:00 A.M.

12:24.677 --> 12:26.246
Thank you.

12:28.147 --> 12:29.616
You shouldn't come back
tomorrow, you know.

12:29.616 --> 12:32.118
Of course not.
But my daddy's forcing me.

12:32.118 --> 12:34.320
No, I mean,
you are so good,

12:34.320 --> 12:35.722
you should have
your own makeup line.

12:35.722 --> 12:37.290
Really?

12:37.290 --> 12:40.026
Why work for the man,
when you can work for yourself?

12:40.026 --> 12:42.695
With the financial backing
of a different man?

12:46.299 --> 12:47.367
Okay.

12:47.367 --> 12:48.601
I'm proud of myself.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.271
Oh my god, Brian!

12:51.271 --> 12:52.739
Oh.

12:52.739 --> 12:54.707
Hey, Kevin.

12:54.707 --> 12:56.009
You okay?

12:56.009 --> 12:57.410
Yeah. Yeah.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.245
(whispering)
I can't feel
my legs, Kevin.

12:59.245 --> 13:01.047
Hey, Brock.

13:01.047 --> 13:02.548
I didn't know that you
would be here.

13:02.548 --> 13:05.084
Brian never said anything
about hanging out
with Brock, did you?

13:05.084 --> 13:07.020
Oh, hey.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.054
Yeah, you work with Audrey.

13:08.054 --> 13:11.324
I do, yeah.
And I heard you guys broke up.

13:11.324 --> 13:12.492
-What?
-Yeah.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.394
I'm sorry to hear that.

13:14.394 --> 13:15.695
Yeah, me too.

13:15.695 --> 13:18.097
I really wish I heard about it
before I got my ass kicked.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.367
Well, hey, look,
I'm no relationship guru,

13:21.367 --> 13:23.970
but hey,
maybe it's for the best?

13:23.970 --> 13:25.972
Really?

13:25.972 --> 13:28.408
Look, there comes a time
in every man's life

13:28.408 --> 13:30.376
where he's gotta
move forward.

13:30.376 --> 13:32.712
Maybe that time
for you is right now.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.114
(scoffs)

13:35.114 --> 13:36.382
You sound like
a men's magazine.

13:36.382 --> 13:38.051
(laughing)

13:38.051 --> 13:40.486
You know 10 new sexual positions
to keep a woman satisfied, too?

13:40.486 --> 13:41.988
(laughs)

13:41.988 --> 13:43.289
No.

13:43.289 --> 13:44.724
Well...

13:44.724 --> 13:47.260
thanks for the advice.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.995
I'm gonna go think about that.

13:50.496 --> 13:51.731
(winces)

13:53.399 --> 13:55.201
That was bold, Kev.

13:55.201 --> 13:56.502
Well, couldn't help it.

13:56.502 --> 13:58.371
Gotta go big
or go home.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.406
Let's start off
by going home,

14:00.406 --> 14:02.442
'cause now I can't feel
anything below my chest.

14:02.442 --> 14:03.543
Okay. Let's get you--

14:03.543 --> 14:05.078
Don't touch--
Don't touch it.

14:05.078 --> 14:06.079
-I didn't touch it.
-No, no, no.

14:06.079 --> 14:07.647
I can feel it,
I can feel it! Don't.

14:13.986 --> 14:15.488
Hey, is Julia looking for me?

14:15.488 --> 14:18.124
No, no, no,
she's also late.

14:18.124 --> 14:21.327
There's a raccoon in
her driveway, and she's scared
to shoo it away,

14:21.327 --> 14:23.062
so Ricky's over there now.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.765
Hey, are you okay?

14:25.765 --> 14:27.533
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

14:27.533 --> 14:30.069
Just... stuff with Brock.

14:30.069 --> 14:33.072
We're not exactly
together at the moment.

14:33.072 --> 14:35.108
But I thought we'd talk last
night, and he never called,

14:35.108 --> 14:36.542
and now I can't
get ahold of him.

14:36.542 --> 14:39.145
-It just goes straight
to voicemail.
-Oh, really?

14:39.145 --> 14:40.446
He must have
turned his phone off

14:40.446 --> 14:42.448
because I can't even track him
on my Find My Friends app.

14:42.448 --> 14:45.017
Well, I'm sure that
he'll resurface.

14:45.017 --> 14:48.054
I mean, he's probably
just thinking things over.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.455
You know, there's...

14:49.455 --> 14:51.157
there's a lot to mull.

14:51.157 --> 14:52.458
Why? What do you mean?

14:52.458 --> 14:54.560
Nothing. It's like a generic
thing that people do.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.762
It's what we do as people.

14:55.762 --> 14:58.398
It's what separates us
from the apes.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.400
-Excuse me.
-Maybe not. Okay.

15:14.347 --> 15:15.381
(shutter clicks)

15:15.381 --> 15:17.417
Everything she likes,
right here.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.618
It's perfect.

15:18.618 --> 15:21.020
Now, I already knew
that she loved
all things blue,

15:21.020 --> 15:23.055
and that she's kind of obsessed
with going to Morocco someday,

15:23.055 --> 15:25.224
but there's some other
helpful stuff in here.
For instance,

15:25.224 --> 15:27.260
she really likes
these Hemsworth guys.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.461
Now, what can we do with that?

15:28.461 --> 15:30.263
Probably nothing.

15:30.263 --> 15:34.100
Well, I picked up a ton
of useful information when
I went out with Audrey.

15:34.100 --> 15:37.737
Her favorite movie, song,
champagne, hair-removal method.

15:37.737 --> 15:41.073
That girl is fast and loose
with the deets when she
is drunk.

15:41.073 --> 15:45.411
Well, I found out Brock really
can break a board by kicking it.

15:45.411 --> 15:47.380
And I think
I blew out my meniscus.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.348
-Oh.
-Sorry.

15:49.348 --> 15:52.285
So, you're gonna drop off
a note for her telling her
where to be and when, right?

15:52.285 --> 15:55.054
Yes, yes, with that dress.
You're buying it for her.

15:55.054 --> 15:56.556
-I'll take care of it.
-No, no, no.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.391
Kev, I said I'll take
care of it.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.259
I have your credit card
information memorized.

16:00.259 --> 16:01.627
Hmm...

16:03.396 --> 16:05.498
Do you mind if I start
before your dad gets here?

16:05.498 --> 16:06.632
You just relax.

16:06.632 --> 16:09.368
You don't want any
of these red ones, do you?

16:09.368 --> 16:11.737
Patti, sweetheart.

16:11.737 --> 16:13.439
And?

16:13.439 --> 16:15.241
Richard, but I go by Ricky,

16:15.241 --> 16:16.742
a nickname I picked up
in business school.

16:16.742 --> 16:18.010
Oh.

16:18.010 --> 16:19.145
From where were
you graduated?

16:19.145 --> 16:22.181
Oh, I didn't achieve
a degree, per se.

16:22.181 --> 16:25.651
I dropped out to follow
Destiny's Child on tour. Per se.

16:25.651 --> 16:28.988
Uh, Ricky has been helping me
with my journey here, Daddy.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.224
You talked someone into being
your driver again, didn't you?

16:31.224 --> 16:33.659
No, sir.
Her makeup journey.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.028
Your daughter is brilliant
with a compact.

16:36.028 --> 16:39.098
And in fact, she was the one
who drove me here today,

16:39.098 --> 16:41.133
where she was also brilliant
with a compact.

16:41.133 --> 16:43.469
You got a job
putting on makeup.

16:43.469 --> 16:44.604
Good for you, sweetheart.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.572
Now, she's ready
to take it to the next level.

16:46.572 --> 16:48.174
My own place,

16:48.174 --> 16:51.077
where women can transform
into their best
beautiful selves.

16:51.077 --> 16:53.479
Why should your daughter work
for a sliver of the profits,

16:53.479 --> 16:55.481
when she can have
the whole pie?

16:55.481 --> 16:56.516
Hmm?

16:56.516 --> 16:58.117
(all laughing)

16:58.117 --> 16:59.151
(chokes)

16:59.151 --> 17:01.053
(muffled)
I'm good, I'm good. I'm good.

17:02.455 --> 17:03.589
Okay.

17:03.589 --> 17:04.624
Oh, thank you, Daddy!

17:04.624 --> 17:06.158
Thank you, daddy.

17:07.393 --> 17:08.661
The red ones are mine.

17:22.008 --> 17:23.242
Okay.

17:23.242 --> 17:25.177
Her favorite champagne
is on ice,

17:25.177 --> 17:26.646
the twinkly lights are on,

17:26.646 --> 17:29.181
the right color peonies.

17:29.181 --> 17:31.050
Thank you guys
for setting this all up.

17:31.050 --> 17:34.220
Who dragged the Moroccan rug
out there? That is
a nice touch.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.755
He did.

17:35.755 --> 17:39.091
Yeah, but, she told me
to fight through
the excruciating pain.

17:39.091 --> 17:40.526
And you made
the delivery, right?

17:40.526 --> 17:41.627
Yes.

17:41.627 --> 17:45.431
<i>One anonymous note,</i>

17:45.431 --> 17:48.267
Look, I really appreciate
everything you guys have done.

17:48.267 --> 17:52.672
I know there have been
a lot of ups and downs with
this whole Audrey situation,

17:52.672 --> 17:54.206
and you've stuck with me.

17:54.206 --> 17:55.675
So, thanks.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.376
Look,

17:57.376 --> 18:01.180
I thought the chances were slim.
Gotta be honest, but...

18:01.180 --> 18:02.381
looking good right now, man.

18:02.381 --> 18:05.017
You are! This is happening!

18:05.017 --> 18:06.218

-Yup.

18:08.120 --> 18:11.290

I have to pass.

18:20.566 --> 18:22.134
I think I need to be here.
