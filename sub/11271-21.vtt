00:03.945 --> 00:07.157
I'LL BE SEEING YOU (PART 1)

00:07.324 --> 00:14.039
OK, everybody, listen up. It's time once
again for the third annuaI Cheers picnic.

00:14.206 --> 00:18.502
I'll need volunteers for
the committees. First, food.

00:18.669 --> 00:21.505
Who'll volunteer
to take care of the grub?

00:26.551 --> 00:30.555
Well, what the heck. I can do this.
Ernie Pantusso.

00:31.639 --> 00:36.352
I did a pretty good job last year.
At least no one complained.

00:38.813 --> 00:42.984
The entertainment committee.
Who wants to chair it?

00:47.238 --> 00:51.492
Well, entertainment goes
with food. Ernie Pantusso.

00:51.659 --> 00:58.583
We'll need two captains for the softball
teams. Two. Come on. A show of hands.

01:02.629 --> 01:06.883
Well, I can handle one team.
Ernie Pantusso.

01:07.050 --> 01:11.678
OK, so who wants the other? One more.

01:14.556 --> 01:21.355
Well, I'm going to be out there on
the field anyway, so... Ernie Pantusso.

01:21.521 --> 01:25.734
Last but not least, I need somebody
to head up transportation.

01:25.901 --> 01:28.612
I got it. Ernie Pantusso.

01:28.779 --> 01:35.285
The meeting of the committee chairmen
is at my house tonight at eight o'clock.

01:35.494 --> 01:38.997
Please, everybody, try to be on time.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074

02:57.365 --> 03:01.369
- Hey, everybody. Sorry I'm late.
- Where have you been?

03:01.536 --> 03:07.166
I had to run a few errands. A funny
thing happened to me this afternoon.

03:07.333 --> 03:11.921
On my way to "Boston Magazine" as one
of the city's 20 most eligible bachelors,

03:12.088 --> 03:14.132
I saw a man walking a dog.

03:14.299 --> 03:20.179
The dog was not walking like a dog. He
was walking like a man, on his hind legs.

03:20.346 --> 03:27.395
Where's a camera when you need one?
OK, enough jokes. Back to work.

03:29.856 --> 03:32.483
20 most eligible bachelors?

03:32.650 --> 03:36.403
- What's that?
- "Boston Magazine"?

03:37.779 --> 03:39.823
And you let them list you?

03:39.990 --> 03:44.119
If I hadn't I would have missed
that funny dog.

03:44.286 --> 03:47.080
You'll dine out on that story.

03:48.248 --> 03:54.588
Why did you want them to list you? It's
for men seeking female companionship.

03:54.796 --> 04:00.802
No. Not entirely.
Just good publicity for the bar, that's all.

04:00.969 --> 04:05.390
And it gave me a chance
to air my views on politicaI issues.

04:09.645 --> 04:12.898
What politicaI issues
did you air views on?

04:13.065 --> 04:17.277
I told them I thought
nuclear war would be bad news.

04:20.947 --> 04:24.617
Sam,
you've stirred up a hornet's nest there.

04:26.827 --> 04:30.247
Really?
I can always say I was misquoted.

04:32.958 --> 04:37.213
I see. "Eligible bachelors"
means eligible for a brain transplant.

04:37.380 --> 04:42.093
I knew it. I knew you'd make
a big deaI out of this. Come on.

04:42.259 --> 04:47.556
It was a nice little article on my life,
my interests and a picture of me.

04:47.723 --> 04:53.354
- It wasn't like it was cheesecake.
- No, Sam. With men, it's beefcake.

04:54.438 --> 04:57.316
If I posed, it would be cheesecake.

04:57.483 --> 05:00.403
If you posed, it would be crumb cake.

05:02.238 --> 05:05.241
Sam, I'm very hurt by this.

05:05.408 --> 05:10.121
Don't be. I'll tell you something
now to make you feeI better.

05:10.287 --> 05:15.750
It was a surprise, but when I talked to
my reporter, I said "I may be a bachelor,

05:15.917 --> 05:22.132
"but it so happens I already found the
woman of my dreams: Diane Chambers. "

05:23.216 --> 05:25.677
Really, Sam?

05:25.885 --> 05:29.139
- That's very sweet.
- Call and check.

05:29.305 --> 05:35.311
- Her name's Helen Castella. Go on.
- I don't have to call. I believe you.

05:35.478 --> 05:39.941
I trust you.
I think that was a wonderfuI thing to do.

05:40.108 --> 05:42.152
Me, too.

05:47.407 --> 05:49.576
She bought that?

05:52.287 --> 05:55.540
I'd like to sell her the old North Church.

05:55.707 --> 05:57.750
Good luck.

05:57.917 --> 05:59.960
I owned that once.

06:03.797 --> 06:06.425
It took me forever to unload it.

06:07.843 --> 06:10.888
Boy, did I take a bath on that.

06:11.054 --> 06:14.725
- I did it this time.
- What are you worried about?

06:14.933 --> 06:21.732
She bought it. When it hits the stands,
tell her the reporter didn't mention it.

06:21.899 --> 06:25.402
- Foolproof.
- At best, I'm just buying time.

06:25.569 --> 06:31.867
She said she wouldn't call, but she'll call.
There's a time when she wouldn't have.

06:34.661 --> 06:40.834
- Sam, you don't trust Diane much?
- I can't trust a thing that woman says.

06:41.001 --> 06:47.341
Once trust goes out of a relationship,
it's really no fun Iying to them any more.

06:53.596 --> 06:57.266
It's not my fault.
She always starts things.

06:57.475 --> 07:01.228
Telling me how to walk,
how to act, how to think.

07:01.395 --> 07:06.025
You've been doing those things
since you were what, 14?

07:08.152 --> 07:14.909
I start doing things I don't want to do,
but knowing it'll tick her off, I do them.

07:15.076 --> 07:19.705
The more it drives her crazy,
the happier I get. Is that weird?

07:19.872 --> 07:21.916
No. We know the woman.

07:23.292 --> 07:26.962
Sammy,
I think it's time for a romantic gesture.

07:27.171 --> 07:31.217
- A trinket to smooth the water.
- I've done all that.

07:31.384 --> 07:36.805
It'll take more than music and a candleIit
dinner to shut her up this time.

07:36.971 --> 07:41.559
Sam, listen.
It's time for you to take a big step.

07:41.726 --> 07:46.523
I wouldn't say this ordinarily
to anyone in a million years.

07:48.233 --> 07:50.860
But you know what might help?

07:51.027 --> 07:55.532
If you actually
had physicaI relations with her.

07:57.784 --> 08:03.790
I don't think so. We'll wait untiI we're
sure how we feeI about each other.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.462
You're a good old-fashioned guy, Sam.

08:11.214 --> 08:17.011
All right. You wanna hear the most
romantic thing I heard a guy do?

08:17.178 --> 08:20.849
Well, I heard that Sally got mad at Burt

08:21.057 --> 08:25.227
because she heard he was doing
another movie with Loni.

08:25.394 --> 08:30.607
So Burt, to make up for it,
had someone paint a portrait of Sally.

08:31.733 --> 08:35.404
Thank you very much
for that enlightenment.

08:35.611 --> 08:39.283
We can knock it off
with the fan magazine driveI.

08:39.491 --> 08:42.828
I read Burt and Sally
are headed for the altar.

08:45.664 --> 08:50.294
That's not a bad idea,
having a portrait done. She'd like that.

08:50.460 --> 08:54.715
- Refill, Sam.
- It shows some thinking. It's sensitive.

08:54.882 --> 09:01.972
The altar? How can Burt do that, with the
terrible secret he and Dinah still share?

09:03.056 --> 09:09.062
Hey. Do you mind here? What kind of
artist should I get to paint Diane?

09:09.229 --> 09:13.232
Get a bad one.
You don't want it to look like her.

09:13.399 --> 09:18.112
Your wisecracks all the time
don't make things any easier.

09:18.279 --> 09:24.869
You know my philosophy. If you can't
say something nice, say it about Diane.

09:26.996 --> 09:32.585
Help me out. Where do you go to find
an artist? Do you go to a store?

09:32.752 --> 09:37.965
We're not talking about TV dinners.
We're talking about artists.

09:38.174 --> 09:42.511
You gotta go where the artists are.
To an artist's place.

09:42.678 --> 09:45.890
What's that secret
Burt and Dinah share?

09:46.057 --> 09:51.854
I can't tell you. In a readers' poll,
I voted they should have more privacy.

09:54.732 --> 09:57.693
Can I put this in check for a minute?

09:57.860 --> 10:03.865
I happen to be a wonderfuI artist
and I'd just love to do a picture of Diane.

10:04.032 --> 10:08.453
- I'd consider it a challenge.
- You never told me about this.

10:08.620 --> 10:10.664
Sure. Let me show you.

10:11.831 --> 10:15.085
Norm, just hold it like that, please.

10:26.096 --> 10:28.973
- Stinks.
- Yeah, it does.

10:29.140 --> 10:34.354
I just remembered. It was my brother
that had the artistic talent.

10:34.521 --> 10:39.359
Now I remember. My talent
is eating things that aren't food.

10:40.527 --> 10:44.531
- Can we get back to artists?
- I deliver maiI to one.

10:44.698 --> 10:48.951
He's very successfuI
and I'll tell you how successfuI.

10:49.118 --> 10:56.291
Yesterday he received a cheque for
$25,853 from a guy named Sweeney.

10:56.458 --> 10:58.502
How do you know that?

10:58.669 --> 11:03.465
When I put it in the slot,
it passed in front of a 300-watt bulb.

11:03.632 --> 11:06.343
Do you want me to get him in here?

11:06.510 --> 11:10.431
I could talk to him.
Do you think he'd come down?

11:10.597 --> 11:16.270
I'll give it a shot. I hesitate to use the
power vested in me by the Post Office

11:16.437 --> 11:21.483
and the Almighty, but I'll make
an exception. You got a dime?

11:21.692 --> 11:26.321
Wait a second. Maybe this whole thing's
about to blow over.

11:32.035 --> 11:35.873
- We've been very childish in the past.
- We have?

11:36.081 --> 11:39.333
Over things like this magazine article.

11:39.500 --> 11:44.714
I was about to call that reporter to check
your story, but I'm proud I didn't.

11:44.922 --> 11:47.550
Me, too.

11:47.717 --> 11:52.930
I know we're not perfect and we're going
through a difficult time,

11:53.139 --> 11:57.935
but I just decided this is the perfect time
to start fresh.

11:58.102 --> 12:01.355
Let's cleanse our relationship.

12:01.522 --> 12:08.779
From this moment on, no more pettiness,
no more suspicion, no more dishonesty.

12:11.866 --> 12:15.620
- You really mean this, don't you?
- I really do.

12:18.122 --> 12:24.128
OK, Diane. I'm going to start being
honest with you right now.

12:24.295 --> 12:30.300
You know I told you I told that reporter
about you? I didn't tell her anything.

12:32.469 --> 12:34.846
- I see.
- I wish I had.

12:37.057 --> 12:40.727
Thank you for respecting me enough
to tell the truth.

12:41.853 --> 12:46.816
I'm glad I didn't tell her. It would
have made me looked whipped.

12:46.983 --> 12:51.571
If you want me to get on that telephone
and tell her, I won't.

12:51.738 --> 12:54.991
I was about to say I would, but I won't.

12:55.158 --> 13:00.538
The truth is that I like having
millions of women looking at my picture

13:00.705 --> 13:02.749
and dreaming, "I want him".

13:02.916 --> 13:05.710
This is me being honest with you here.

13:07.963 --> 13:10.340
That's exactly what I wanted.

13:10.548 --> 13:13.968
This is great.
Why didn't we do this sooner?

13:14.134 --> 13:18.847
- I don't know.
- You see, if you start telling the truth...

13:23.268 --> 13:25.938
Sammy, I'll make that phone call.

13:27.648 --> 13:31.318
You kids just carry on
with what you're doing.

13:40.765 --> 13:44.102
Someone put their names
on your picnic sheet.

13:44.269 --> 13:46.187
No kidding. How many?

13:46.354 --> 13:50.984
Three. We got Ziggy Stardust,
the Mad Hatter and Clark Kent.

13:52.068 --> 13:54.904
Looks like I got myself an in-field.

13:57.073 --> 13:59.450
Evening, everybody.

14:00.451 --> 14:03.704
- How are you feeling?
- Naked without my beer.

14:03.870 --> 14:07.624
Walked over here,
dragging my thirst behind me.

14:07.833 --> 14:11.336
- So how was dinner?
- Listen up, everybody.

14:11.545 --> 14:15.298
Stay away
from that Hungry Heifer place.

14:15.465 --> 14:18.218
They've been advertising. No good?

14:18.385 --> 14:24.391
AwfuI. They served a terrible piece of
meat, tough potatoes, soggy vegetables.

14:24.558 --> 14:28.186
- Why didn't you send it back?
- The service stinks.

14:28.353 --> 14:33.066
By the time the waiter asked me
if it was OK, I was through.

14:40.115 --> 14:44.745
- Can I help you?
- I have come to pander to the tasteless.

14:44.911 --> 14:50.541
You want to head the food committee.
A chairman for the food committee!

14:51.917 --> 14:57.256
- I like my buffalo sunny-side up, Chief.
- Are you referring to my appareI?

14:57.423 --> 15:04.472
No offence there, Little Beaver,
but it is a tad out of the mundane.

15:04.638 --> 15:07.558
Excuse me, but what is that outfit?

15:07.725 --> 15:14.815
An Arapaho ceremoniaI tunic worn by the
village elders when they hold counciI.

15:14.982 --> 15:19.779
I earned it by letting them pierce
my flesh with wild turkey quills.

15:21.197 --> 15:25.201
This is a JC Penney wash and wear,
tapered tails.

15:25.367 --> 15:30.080
The salesman was nasty,
but I didn't have to go through that.

15:32.291 --> 15:38.505
I'm looking for Sam Malone. He's
interested in buying some of my work.

15:38.671 --> 15:44.302
You must be Phillip Semenko.
I'm Cliff Clavin, your mailman.

15:44.469 --> 15:49.140
- We finally meet face to face.
- I can die now.

15:50.934 --> 15:55.647
Yeah. You've got a great wit about you.
Thanks for stopping by.

15:55.813 --> 15:59.817
- I don't like to be touched.
- I can grok that.

15:59.984 --> 16:02.654
I don't like to be touched either.

16:02.820 --> 16:07.450
I bet neither one of you
has to tell that to a lot of people.

16:09.369 --> 16:14.582
Here's the connoisseur. Sam,
our artist friend Mr Semenko is here.

16:15.667 --> 16:22.715
Hi, I'm Sam Malone, Mr Cementma...
Samakama...

16:22.882 --> 16:27.594
That walking fire hydrant told me
you were a man of intelligence.

16:27.761 --> 16:33.308
- I see no evidence of that.
- Maybe he's exaggerating a little bit.

16:33.475 --> 16:37.646
I'm new to this art thing,
but I've heard good things about you.

16:37.813 --> 16:42.943
You could get me out of the dog house
by painting a picture of my girlfriend.

16:43.151 --> 16:48.907
I don't care how you do this. Make it look
like her and have it here by tomorrow.

16:51.034 --> 16:54.496
I got some snapshots I took
in the mountains.

16:54.663 --> 17:01.503
That's her on the left. These were taken
in New Hampshire. We got a little cabin.

17:01.670 --> 17:07.675
I'm wearing the funny hat there
in that one. This one's pretty good.

17:07.843 --> 17:11.847
It's shot up in the cabin.
You ever get up that way?

17:13.222 --> 17:15.683
I guess not.

17:15.849 --> 17:19.103
It is OK if you hold these by the edges.

17:21.188 --> 17:24.858
- Is there a problem here?
- Your existence.

17:25.067 --> 17:29.864
I was told I was to meet a wealthy
art investor who could fill my coffers.

17:30.031 --> 17:32.867
No, I'm not above that yet.

17:35.077 --> 17:38.748
Instead, I find myself facing
a nightmarish product

17:38.956 --> 17:42.376
of our floundering educationaI system.

17:42.585 --> 17:46.172
Hey, I don't have to take that. Do I?

17:48.007 --> 17:54.513
- Let's just call this whole thing off.
- You are an ignorant man. You all are.

17:54.680 --> 17:57.767
You are all stuff to fill graves.

17:57.933 --> 18:02.145
Don't forget to tell your friends
about Cheers?

18:02.312 --> 18:05.690
Don't feeI too bad.
I feeI I'm partly to blame.

18:05.857 --> 18:07.901
Let's talk, Cliff.

18:10.779 --> 18:13.990
Hello, everyone. I'm back.

18:15.408 --> 18:18.703
I'm sorry I stormed off like that.

18:21.456 --> 18:27.462
I've cooled off. Coach, Carla,
everybody, let's just continue.

18:28.797 --> 18:33.051
It's important you know
I wasn't really trying to kill Sam

18:33.218 --> 18:36.095
when I wrapped the telephone cord...

18:37.180 --> 18:42.477
- May I help you?
- That's the face I've been looking for.

18:42.644 --> 18:45.021
Sorry, I'm still using it.

18:47.106 --> 18:50.776
I could let you visit it on weekends.

18:54.488 --> 18:57.199
- Two draughts, Coach.
- Coming up.

19:22.182 --> 19:24.560
What?

19:25.686 --> 19:29.690
- What do you want from me?
- I'm Phillip Semenko.

19:29.856 --> 19:32.651
I want to paint you.

19:34.528 --> 19:37.238
Phillip Semenko, the genius?

19:38.531 --> 19:40.741
That's redundant.

19:41.784 --> 19:45.079
I've seen your work and you're brilliant.

19:47.123 --> 19:50.459
And I love this Arapaho ceremoniaI tunic.

19:54.046 --> 19:56.048
What are you doing here?

19:56.215 --> 20:00.469
Up to now, fondly remembering
my bout with jaundice.

20:00.636 --> 20:04.307
Then I saw you.
I want you to be my next subject.

20:05.474 --> 20:09.145
You're kidding. Me? Why?

20:12.773 --> 20:18.946
You have an ancient souI and it's
suffering more than it ever has before.

20:19.947 --> 20:22.575
Suffering?

20:22.742 --> 20:29.247
Your spirit is imprisoned, trapped.
Stretched on a rack.

20:30.332 --> 20:36.921
Your eyes have the look
of a strangling sparrow.

20:41.634 --> 20:45.722
Well, that's in this year.
Last year it was bangs.

20:47.015 --> 20:49.559
Hey, Tonto. I told you to beat it.

20:49.768 --> 20:55.523
- Something important is happening.
- You're leaving. The deaI's off. Beat it.

20:55.690 --> 21:02.530
You have nothing to do with this! How
dare you interrupt the artistic process?

21:02.697 --> 21:05.867
That's how I get my kicks.
Now, vamoose.

21:06.034 --> 21:11.498
Stop. This is Phillip Semenko,
the genius. He wants to paint me.

21:11.664 --> 21:14.666
I've never been so excited in my life.

21:14.833 --> 21:17.961
- You heard of this clown?
- Of course.

21:18.128 --> 21:24.134
He's the country's most promising young
artists. Some day he could be great.

21:24.301 --> 21:28.555
Come on. If he's a great artist,
what's he doing alive?

21:30.224 --> 21:34.770
Sam, will you stop?
This is the chance of a lifetime.

21:34.937 --> 21:38.440
Can't you see
how fascinated he is by me?

21:38.649 --> 21:42.194
I must start our sessions tomorrow.
Maybe now.

21:42.361 --> 21:45.781
Wait a minute.
Don't you see what's going on?

21:45.948 --> 21:49.326
He'll invite you to his place,
get you nuded up.

21:49.493 --> 21:51.954
That happens to be my territory.

21:52.120 --> 21:58.168
Sam, don't be silly.
Of course he wouldn't want me nude.

21:58.335 --> 22:04.757
Even if he did, I'd do it. He is brilliant.
You don't want me in the nude, do you?

22:04.924 --> 22:11.264
I'm open-minded about that sort of thing.
It's just there are so many colds around.

22:11.472 --> 22:16.269
I paint the souI, not the body.
To me, every souI is naked.

22:16.435 --> 22:18.896
The weirdo walks.

22:20.022 --> 22:26.195
Sam, I want him to paint me.
I can't let an opportunity like this pass.

22:26.362 --> 22:29.615
Honey, I don't like him.

22:29.782 --> 22:36.038
You do anything with him, go anywhere,
share a bus with him and we're through.

22:36.205 --> 22:38.291
I have spoken.

22:41.460 --> 22:43.838
- Fine.
- What?

22:44.046 --> 22:50.051
I said fine. Whatever you want. I see
how strongly you feeI about it, so fine.

22:50.218 --> 22:54.347
Yeah? In that case,
I got something else to tell you.

22:54.514 --> 22:57.517
And as soon as I think of it, I will.

23:05.442 --> 23:09.571
I can only imagine
the hell you've endured.

23:09.738 --> 23:13.992
- It hasn't been easy.
- Well, goodbye.

23:17.120 --> 23:20.790
Wait. I really want you to paint me.

23:20.999 --> 23:24.377
What about that malignant growth
you call a boyfriend?

23:26.421 --> 23:31.885
Give him time to cooI down. Once he
sees the finished work, he'll forgive me.

23:32.052 --> 23:38.390
- He'll forgive you and forgive everything.
- He'll hate it and hate you for doing it.

23:38.599 --> 23:42.269
If you pose for me, it'll drive a wedge
between you and him.

23:44.396 --> 23:46.607
So you won't do it?

23:46.774 --> 23:49.151
I'll do it for free.

23:54.490 --> 23:59.995
Hey, listen up, everybody. I'm sorry
about coming on strong like that.

24:00.162 --> 24:04.875
It seems unprofessionaI,
but roughhouse is the only language

24:05.042 --> 24:08.712
some people understand
and I know how to speak it.

24:08.921 --> 24:14.593
Thanks for your attention. Go back and
have some fun there. Where's Diane?

24:15.677 --> 24:17.763
TO BE CONTINUED...
