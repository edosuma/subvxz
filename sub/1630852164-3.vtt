if you want, you can sit
in the corner and watch.

07:59.712 --> 08:01.540
But no eye contact

08:01.584 --> 08:02.759
'cause that'll throw me
off my game.

08:02.802 --> 08:04.064
-O-Okay.
-All right.

08:04.108 --> 08:05.501
Come on, let's go in
before the pill kicks in.

08:05.544 --> 08:07.067
Y-Yeah. Okay.

08:07.111 --> 08:08.460
Honey.

08:10.593 --> 08:12.551
Yeah, what I'm saying is
Silly String's not so silly

08:12.595 --> 08:13.857
when it's stuck
in a wheel bearing.

08:13.900 --> 08:17.687
So, actions do have
consequences. You know?

08:17.730 --> 08:20.777
Smokey! Filing a damage report
here, boss.

08:20.820 --> 08:22.561
I don't know what to tell you.

08:22.605 --> 08:23.997
I'm gonna have to
sell the joint.

08:24.041 --> 08:28.088
Lot of good people
are gonna lose their jobs.

08:28.132 --> 08:30.787
Kills me, but it's over.

something in there for you.

-Yeah, whatever.
-Say hello to your sister.

08:46.716 --> 08:48.326
[door opens, closes]

08:48.369 --> 08:49.762
Well, there you go. You happy?

08:49.806 --> 08:52.678
Wha...

08:52.722 --> 08:54.071
What was that?

08:54.114 --> 08:55.986
That's how it's done.

08:56.029 --> 08:59.250
Uh, it was a little fast,
but she was hot. [chuckles]

08:59.293 --> 09:01.382
I f... I feel like
I just watched you

09:01.426 --> 09:03.036
have sex with a prostitute.

09:03.080 --> 09:05.561
-Yeah.
-Why?

09:05.604 --> 09:07.563
What do you mean why?
It was your idea.

09:07.606 --> 09:09.608
[stammers] I didn't want
to watch you have sex.

09:09.652 --> 09:12.002
I didn't want you
to watch me have sex, either.

09:12.045 --> 09:13.830
I thought you were gonna
show me what you do at work.

09:13.873 --> 09:15.832
This is what I do at work.

09:15.875 --> 09:17.660
Well... [scoffs]
does Mom know about this?

09:17.703 --> 09:19.009
Don't bring
your mother into this.

09:19.052 --> 09:20.445
I'm not gonna
let you watch next time.

09:20.488 --> 09:22.229
I don't want to watch next time!

09:22.273 --> 09:23.883
I didn't want
to watch this time!

09:23.927 --> 09:26.277
All right, look,
you're officially fired.

09:26.320 --> 09:27.800
What-what?

09:27.844 --> 09:30.498
This is not working out
for me, Dennis. You-you...

09:30.542 --> 09:33.371
you watched me bang, I mean,
and now you're whining.

09:33.414 --> 09:36.548
You're gonna go cry
to your mommy. It's too much.

09:36.592 --> 09:38.681
I don't even know what it is
I'm being fired from.

09:38.724 --> 09:40.770

Here's five grand.

What-what is this?

09:44.425 --> 09:46.514
That's to keep your mouth shut.
That's your paycheck.

09:46.558 --> 09:49.517
I-I don't understand.
What is happening?

09:49.561 --> 09:51.650
-That's your severance pay.
-My sever...

Go on.

09:57.351 --> 09:59.876
Sup, son.
I'm having the best night.

09:59.919 --> 10:01.747
I just sold two ounces
of Compton Endo.

10:01.791 --> 10:04.097
Yeah, well, all right,

10:04.141 --> 10:06.926
I-I hate to rain on your
drug-dealing parade, but, um,

10:06.970 --> 10:08.841
Smokey's selling
this joint, man.

10:08.885 --> 10:11.104
So what? I could
deal drugs wherever.

10:11.148 --> 10:13.063
Hey, you should
come work for me, man.

Whoa, dude, there's got to be,
like, $80 in there.

10:18.895 --> 10:21.071
It's $4,000, Charlie.

10:21.114 --> 10:22.899

like, two hours.

10:22.942 --> 10:24.465
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

Shit, man, but, like,
isn't dealing drugs,

10:26.250 --> 10:27.338
isn't that kind of dangerous?

10:27.381 --> 10:30.558
Damn straight it is, Charlie.

10:30.602 --> 10:32.125
That's why I got myself a gat.

Cool, huh?

10:38.175 --> 10:39.176
Put that shit away, all right?

Don't let Smokey
see you with that.

-Hey, Dee.

10:43.136 --> 10:45.225
Charlie, can you tighten
the axle nuts on these?

10:45.269 --> 10:47.750
My friends and I are working on
sort of a farewell routine.

10:47.793 --> 10:50.535
Oh, got to tighten
them Dee's nuts.

10:50.578 --> 10:51.623
[Mac chuckles]

10:51.667 --> 10:53.407
Dee's nuts.

10:53.451 --> 10:55.366
They're your nuts,
so I said, "Dee's nuts." Like...

10:55.409 --> 10:58.978
Yeah, I-I'm sorry. I just don't
find crass humor that funny.

10:59.022 --> 11:00.414
-Yeah.
-Oh, yeah, sorry.

11:00.458 --> 11:02.634
Oh, yeah. Um, but, Dee,
just a quick heads-up,

11:02.678 --> 11:05.202
like, if I tighten up
these nuts, it's gonna...

11:05.245 --> 11:06.594
-Dee's nuts. Now I said it.
-[laughs]

11:06.638 --> 11:08.509
[laughs] That happens.

11:08.553 --> 11:10.163
I'm so sorry.
But-but in all seriousness,

11:10.207 --> 11:12.383
if-if I do tighten up the, uh,

11:12.426 --> 11:14.254
the axle nuts,
it's gonna slow you down.

11:14.298 --> 11:16.039
I know. The thing is,
my friends,

11:16.082 --> 11:17.344
they're just not as fast as me,

11:17.388 --> 11:18.955
and I don't want to hurt
their self-esteem,

11:18.998 --> 11:21.479
so I just figured if I make
myself slower, everyone's happy.

11:21.522 --> 11:23.786
-Oh, that's super nice of you.
-Oh, yeah.

11:23.829 --> 11:26.223

I'll admit that.

Cool? Charlie, in 20 years,

11:34.622 --> 11:36.755
everybody's gonna have a beeper.
Mark my words.

11:36.799 --> 11:39.279
Yeah, yeah. Also, you keep
saying that, and I don't know

11:39.323 --> 11:40.890
if you're, like,
fully expecting me to, like,

11:40.933 --> 11:43.109
mark these words down 'cause
I don't have, like, a pen on me.

11:43.153 --> 11:44.545
Okay, come on, let's go.
They're-they're outside.

Yeah, okay. Uh, all right.
Stepping away, Smoke.

Just play it cool, man.

not that hard.

It's very easy. It's very easy.

-Mm-hmm.

12:02.172 --> 12:03.434
"How much do you want?"

-Uh-huh.

And then, um, maybe
I'll introduce myself, too?

12:11.094 --> 12:12.878

customer service is important.

-Um...

No, no, don't do that
because it's not.

12:15.838 --> 12:17.448
It's a drug deal.

Yeah, but if they don't feel
comfortable, you know, like,

12:18.971 --> 12:21.191
knowing me, they might not
return as customers.

12:21.234 --> 12:22.540
You don't want them to know you.

12:22.583 --> 12:23.802

addicted to the drugs.

I'm on skates.

Uh, that's the handle.
Just the handle.

14:00.072 --> 14:01.726
I can see that. You're
carrying around a gun handle?

Yeah, I found it in the trash.

All right, well,
look on the bright side, Mac.

Oh, uh, yeah, it was cool.
You know, um,

don't really think it's for me.

Oh?

14:41.418 --> 14:42.723
Really? Why? Like, what it is?

complicated, you know?

to describe what I saw.

Why?

14:52.995 --> 14:54.648
Look, suffice it to say,

14:54.692 --> 14:56.128
I-I don't want to have
anything to do

14:56.172 --> 14:57.956
with that kind of business,

that my dad's a bad man.

gonna see that guy again

-Yeah.

15:21.240 --> 15:23.068
Like-like, we do what Dennis's
dad does at work, right,

15:23.112 --> 15:24.591
but we do it with each other.

15:24.635 --> 15:27.638
You don't want to do
what my dad does, okay?

15:27.681 --> 15:29.596
[stammers] And definitely not
with each other.

15:29.640 --> 15:31.250
-All right.
-Um, so, I'd like to clarify

15:31.294 --> 15:32.686
by saying that I think
what we should do

15:32.730 --> 15:34.297
is invest in ourselves.

15:34.340 --> 15:35.994
Yeah, I mean, like,
right, that's what I mean.

15:36.038 --> 15:37.822
Like, check this out, like, what
if we buy the rink from Smokey?

15:37.865 --> 15:39.258
Oh, shit.

15:39.302 --> 15:41.173

-Yeah.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.093
Oh, my God. That's crazy.

15:48.137 --> 15:49.529
I just got five grand
from my dad.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.749
Oh, dudes, that's perfect.
I just got 25 cents,

15:51.792 --> 15:53.577
uh, from the machine over there.

15:53.620 --> 15:57.059
25 cents is not gonna
get us shit, man.

15:57.102 --> 15:58.625
Oh, no, I mean,
I just got it now.

15:58.669 --> 16:00.018
I have more saved up.
[chuckles]

16:00.062 --> 16:01.585
Well, okay, well,
how much do you have total?

16:01.628 --> 16:04.066
From the machines
and my paycheck

16:04.109 --> 16:06.024
and just, like,
saving the quarters and shit,

16:06.068 --> 16:08.113
I've saved up, like, $57,000.

16:13.075 --> 16:15.425

-Oh, that's-that's-that's...

16:15.468 --> 16:16.556

-You know what?

16:16.600 --> 16:17.818
That actually might be enough

16:17.862 --> 16:19.211
-for an equal partnership
with us.
-Yes.

16:19.255 --> 16:21.039
-Yeah. Well...
-Yeah.

16:21.083 --> 16:23.085
-Equal doesn't quite
make sense...
-Hey, you know what,

16:23.128 --> 16:24.390
I'm starving.
Do they have sandwiches here?

16:24.434 --> 16:26.262
Well, yeah, you know,
they do have sandwiches.

16:26.305 --> 16:27.654
-Would you like a sandwich?
-Yeah. You want something
with meat on it?

16:27.698 --> 16:29.482
The sandwiches
are good, but, like...

16:29.526 --> 16:30.657
I'm-I'm paying.
I'll pay for the sandwich.
