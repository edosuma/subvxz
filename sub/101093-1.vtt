00:31.100 --> 00:33.169
Hey, guys, Graham here.
How's it going?

00:34.337 --> 00:36.772
Today marks
the two-year anniversary

00:36.805 --> 00:39.541
since I've been making
videos for the internet.

00:40.243 --> 00:41.144
Whoo.

00:42.111 --> 00:44.213
So because of that,
I wanted to do something

00:44.247 --> 00:46.282
a little bit different.

00:46.315 --> 00:48.084
So I'm going
to tell you two stories.

00:48.984 --> 00:50.719
Two stories that I think sum up

00:50.752 --> 00:54.023
what it's like to make
videos for the internet.

00:54.057 --> 00:55.724
And it might get
a little abstract,

00:55.757 --> 00:57.692
so please bear with me.

00:59.628 --> 01:03.565
First story is about
paratroopers in World War II.

01:04.300 --> 01:05.901
Obviously.

01:05.934 --> 01:09.072
But specifically
I'm talking about D-Day.

01:10.839 --> 01:14.077
Now, obviously,
there were a lot of

01:14.110 --> 01:17.813
fatalities and, um,
casualties that day.

01:18.780 --> 01:22.951
But there was one bizarre
and common injury

01:22.984 --> 01:24.420
that was caused

01:24.454 --> 01:26.222
not by the enemy,

01:26.255 --> 01:29.925
but by the perceptions
of the soldiers themselves.

01:29.958 --> 01:32.261
[dramatic music]

01:32.295 --> 01:36.731
<i>You see, a lot of paratroopers
missed their targets.</i>

01:36.765 --> 01:41.337
<i>They ended up in ponds
or lakes or trees or whatever.</i>

01:41.370 --> 01:43.738
<i>Some of them ended
up on rooftops.</i>

01:44.906 --> 01:47.009
<i>Now, think of yourself
in that situation,</i>

01:47.043 --> 01:49.678
<i>you land on a rooftop,
what would you do?</i>

01:49.711 --> 01:53.015
<i>You'd probably try
and climb down into a window</i>

01:53.049 --> 01:54.950
<i>on the upper story
and get inside,</i>

01:54.983 --> 01:56.352
<i>just take the stairs downstairs.</i>

01:57.386 --> 02:00.655
<i>Well, what a lot
of these paratroopers did...</i>

02:01.690 --> 02:04.393
<i>was they walked up
to the edge of the roof...</i>

02:05.994 --> 02:07.029
<i>and just jumped off.</i>

02:08.330 --> 02:10.433
<i>Just multiple stories,
straight down to the ground,</i>

02:10.466 --> 02:12.767
<i>breaking their legs or worse.</i>

02:14.170 --> 02:15.937
<i>You see,
what was happening was...</i>

02:17.240 --> 02:20.742
<i>they'd just jumped
a thousand feet and survived.</i>

02:22.178 --> 02:24.880
<i>So to them,
looking down from the roof...</i>

02:26.015 --> 02:27.450
<i>the drop to the ground
was nothing.</i>

02:29.051 --> 02:31.720
<i>With just a slight change
in their perception...</i>

02:32.954 --> 02:36.825
<i>they'd managed to change
an inherent truth...</i>

02:37.792 --> 02:40.363
<i>that if you jump off of a roof,
you're going to hurt yourself...</i>

02:41.397 --> 02:42.465
<i>into a fallacy.</i>

02:46.269 --> 02:47.303
That's the first story.

02:48.304 --> 02:49.838
Second story

02:49.871 --> 02:52.008
is a little bit more personal,

02:52.041 --> 02:54.443
and is about my friend Stephen.

02:54.477 --> 02:56.112
[ominous music]

02:56.145 --> 02:59.215
<i>So, Stephen's a photographer
and a traveler.</i>

03:00.483 --> 03:02.285
<i>He went all around the world,</i>

03:02.318 --> 03:03.952
<i>took photos wherever he went.</i>

03:05.254 --> 03:08.191
<i>And I thought that
he should share these online.</i>

03:08.224 --> 03:10.493
<i>So I encouraged him
to set up a blog.</i>

03:12.361 --> 03:15.064
<i>He was resistant at first,
but ultimately he did it.</i>

03:16.165 --> 03:19.468
<i>And people started following and
sharing their opinions on his work.</i>

03:20.570 --> 03:22.338
<i>Some good, some not so good.</i>

03:23.372 --> 03:24.906
<i>This is the internet after all.</i>

03:25.907 --> 03:29.744
<i>And it was around then
that things got scary.</i>

03:31.980 --> 03:35.451
<i>He sent me a photo
with only this caption:</i>

03:36.985 --> 03:38.820
<i>"Can you see it?"</i>

03:38.853 --> 03:40.489
<i>This is the photo.</i>

03:40.523 --> 03:41.524
<i>Can you see it?</i>

03:52.134 --> 03:55.371
<i>After Stephen insisted that
the photo wasn't faked...</i>

03:56.572 --> 03:58.274
<i>he proceeded to send more.</i>

03:59.308 --> 04:02.044
[ominous music]

04:06.382 --> 04:08.050
<i>But that wasn't
the weirdest thing...</i>

04:09.051 --> 04:11.020
<i>I asked him what
he thought was causing it,</i>

04:11.953 --> 04:13.322
<i>or what it was.</i>

04:15.057 --> 04:17.192
<i>And what he said to me really</i>

04:17.226 --> 04:20.096
<i>freaked me out for a long time.</i>

04:22.231 --> 04:25.501
<i>He said,
"Can't you see it, Graham?</i>

04:26.602 --> 04:27.503
<i>It's you."</i>

04:30.106 --> 04:33.942
I didn't hear from Stephen
for a good while after that.

04:35.311 --> 04:37.280
And it wasn't until
a couple of years later

04:37.313 --> 04:40.049
that I bumped into him
and I was able to ask him

04:40.915 --> 04:41.950
about the photos,

04:43.219 --> 04:45.254
and whether he was still getting
any weird apparitions in them.

04:46.355 --> 04:49.091
And he said to me,
it, it was funny.

04:50.259 --> 04:54.263
He hadn't seen anything
strange in the photos

04:54.297 --> 04:56.198
since the day that
he shut his blog down.

05:00.336 --> 05:04.106
Anyway, that's, uh,
that's all from me today.

05:04.140 --> 05:06.475
Sorry it's a bit
doom and gloom today.

05:06.509 --> 05:10.079
Um, things will be back
to normal next week, um.

05:10.112 --> 05:12.881
Uh, it'll be a bit more
upbeat, hopefully.

it was
the laser eye surgery video.

it after the fact...

09:29.705 --> 09:31.307
But, uh, yeah,
they made a mistake.

09:31.340 --> 09:35.177
So I am blind
for the next 24 hours,

09:35.210 --> 09:36.779
until I can take this off.

09:36.812 --> 09:39.915
They said that if I, uh,
take it off too early,

09:39.949 --> 09:41.650
I could get permanent damage.

09:42.718 --> 09:46.722

something was in his house.

And that's what made
it really scary.

I'd seen his acting,
he's not that good.

12:03.492 --> 12:05.294

12:28.684 --> 12:31.887
I don't want to talk about it.

12:31.920 --> 12:35.390
Yeah, well, it's been
three weeks now, so.

12:35.424 --> 12:37.359
I'm trying to do something here.

12:39.661 --> 12:41.530
Graham, you can't
just ignore it.

12:42.798 --> 12:44.333
[sighs]

12:44.366 --> 12:45.901
Look, what's your plan here?
You're just going

12:45.934 --> 12:48.771
to stay in my flat and what?
Make bottle videos?

12:50.439 --> 12:52.374
For your information,
bottle flipping

12:52.407 --> 12:53.542
is a legitimate skill.

12:54.409 --> 12:56.311
And it's trending
massively right now, so.

12:56.345 --> 12:58.514
Ah, fuck's sake, Graham.

12:58.547 --> 12:59.948
Look, listen to me!

13:01.617 --> 13:03.585
Whatever you saw,
whatever happened,

13:03.619 --> 13:05.687
you can either get the police
to investigate it...

13:07.023 --> 13:08.791
or you.

13:08.824 --> 13:11.094
You can go and investigate it,
yourself.

13:11.960 --> 13:13.595
Oh, man, look, you've been
waiting for a video

13:13.629 --> 13:15.064
to go viral for years.

13:16.132 --> 13:18.367
And now there's one that's just
handed to you on a platter,

13:18.400 --> 13:20.302
and, and you're just
going to ignore it?

13:22.471 --> 13:24.973
[sighs] Just do it.

13:25.008 --> 13:26.042
Just use it.

13:27.910 --> 13:29.611
I'll come with you,
we'll go back to the flat,

13:29.645 --> 13:31.980
we'll, we'll investigate it,
we'll document it.

13:33.615 --> 13:35.384
And if it's real,

13:35.417 --> 13:36.552
whatever you saw...

13:37.619 --> 13:39.955
Oh, my God, like,
can you imagine?

13:39.988 --> 13:42.025
A real fucking ghost.

13:42.058 --> 13:44.093
[both chuckle]

13:44.127 --> 13:45.028
Look.

13:46.862 --> 13:48.363
Think about it.

13:48.397 --> 13:49.132
[thud]

13:50.766 --> 13:51.667
You in?

13:58.041 --> 14:00.809
So, here we are, uh,
back at my flat.

14:00.843 --> 14:02.578
Erin convinced me to come back,

14:02.611 --> 14:04.379
um, you know,

14:05.081 --> 14:07.116
to investigate the ghost.

14:07.150 --> 14:11.020
The ghost, this alleged ghost
that exists in his flat.

14:11.054 --> 14:12.521
Yeah, alleged, alleged.

14:12.554 --> 14:14.857
Alleged. [laughs]

14:14.890 --> 14:18.493
So, yeah, we're going
to go in there, um.

14:18.527 --> 14:19.862
Erin's packing heat.

14:19.895 --> 14:22.664
- You know...
- I'm ready. I'm really prepared.

14:22.698 --> 14:24.933
I'm, I'm kind of,
I'm pretty nervous,

14:24.967 --> 14:27.603
I feel a bit weird,
but I'm... [tapping]

14:27.636 --> 14:29.738
I'm, I'm just going to stand
behind Erin as she...

14:29.771 --> 14:31.807
- Yeah, okay.
- But, anyhow, here we go.

14:31.840 --> 14:33.109
- Okay.
- Let's see.

14:33.142 --> 14:34.877
[Erin]
Do it! Am I going first?

14:34.910 --> 14:36.645
[Graham]
Yeah, of course.

14:36.678 --> 14:37.913
[Graham]
Of course you're going first.

14:37.946 --> 14:40.849
[Erin]
You're too kind. Oh, my God.

14:41.717 --> 14:43.652
Okay, all good.

14:48.523 --> 14:49.725
[Erin chuckles]

14:49.758 --> 14:51.460
This is really creepy.

14:51.493 --> 14:53.462
Why am I so nervous?
It's stupid.

14:53.495 --> 14:55.964
I don't know, it looks all fine.

14:55.998 --> 14:58.667
There's no reason
to be nervous or, uh...

15:01.170 --> 15:03.739
- [Erin] Fuck.
- [Graham] What is it?

15:05.941 --> 15:07.176
You're fucking with me.

15:07.210 --> 15:09.012
- You're fucking with me!
- What? No.

15:09.045 --> 15:11.180
Yeah, you are, oh, my God,
what the hell?

15:12.181 --> 15:14.583
[Graham]
Fucking flat.

15:14.616 --> 15:15.784
[Erin]
Holy shit.

15:19.188 --> 15:20.123
[Erin]
It's like...

15:21.556 --> 15:25.894
what, what,
why would someone do that?

15:25.928 --> 15:28.097
Like, if someone come into
your flat, what, would they just

15:28.131 --> 15:29.831
tip things all over the place?

15:29.865 --> 15:32.268
- [Graham laughs]
- [Erin] That makes no sense.

15:32.302 --> 15:35.171
Like, that's really
freaking me out, Graham.

15:35.204 --> 15:36.939
[Graham]
Well, it wasn't me.

15:37.806 --> 15:39.741
[Erin]
Shut up, I don't believe you.

15:40.575 --> 15:42.611
- [Graham sighs]
- I don't believe you!

15:42.644 --> 15:45.614
- [knocking]
- [Erin] Are you serious?

15:45.647 --> 15:47.883
- You didn't do this?
- [Graham] I didn't do this, no.

15:47.916 --> 15:50.852
[Erin] This is really,
that's really horrible.

15:50.886 --> 15:52.188
[Graham]
They've left the laptop.

15:52.221 --> 15:54.623
- [Erin] Oh, good.
- [Graham] And the TV.

15:54.656 --> 15:57.193
[Erin] Well,
ghosts don't really use laptops, so.

15:57.226 --> 15:58.660
[laughs]

15:58.694 --> 16:00.629
Oh, my God.

16:00.662 --> 16:02.798
Oh, my God,
that's really messed up.

16:02.831 --> 16:04.033
- [Graham] What is it?
- Look.

16:06.535 --> 16:09.272
[Graham]
What the fuck is that?

16:09.305 --> 16:11.773
[Erin] Oh, my God, that's like...
[chuckles] sorry.

16:11.807 --> 16:14.676
It's like,
"Prepare for laughter."

16:14.710 --> 16:16.778
That makes no sense whatsoever.

16:18.247 --> 16:21.217
It's really freaking me out,
it's really, like,

16:21.250 --> 16:24.220
I don't know, like, why would
someone come in here and like,

16:24.253 --> 16:26.055
like, fucking write
on your wall?

16:26.089 --> 16:27.889
[Graham] It's just some sort
of sick joke or something.

16:27.923 --> 16:29.825
Yeah, unless you're still
pulling my leg, because.

16:29.858 --> 16:32.195
[Graham chuckles]
No, no it's not, no, come on.

16:32.228 --> 16:33.762
Because that'd be really
messed up if that is,

16:33.795 --> 16:37.033
- no, not impressed.
- No, Erin, honestly...

16:37.066 --> 16:38.167
- [thud]
- [screaming]

16:38.201 --> 16:39.202
Oh, my God!

16:40.569 --> 16:41.570
What?

16:41.603 --> 16:44.639
[clock ticking]

16:46.275 --> 16:47.542
[Graham]
Can you stay here tonight?

16:48.977 --> 16:52.015
[painting]

16:57.053 --> 16:58.954
It's kind of unsettling
to think that the message

16:58.987 --> 17:00.822
is still going to be
underneath this paint.

17:03.092 --> 17:05.727
Like, I'm not getting rid of it,
it's, it's still here.

17:15.304 --> 17:18.340
[tapping]

17:27.250 --> 17:28.351
Hey, do we have
a bigger paintbrush?

17:29.684 --> 17:32.721
[whispering]

17:50.672 --> 17:52.375
[breathing heavily]

17:52.408 --> 17:53.708
I'm scared.

17:59.815 --> 18:01.017
[Graham]
I'm scared too.

18:08.723 --> 18:10.426
- What was that?
- Shh.

18:10.460 --> 18:13.862
[indistinct noises]

18:13.895 --> 18:15.364
- What's that?
- [growling]

18:15.398 --> 18:17.133
- [Graham] Ah, jeez, what the fuck?
- What?

18:17.166 --> 18:19.901
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, wh... what was it?

18:19.935 --> 18:23.039
- There is a person.
- What? Graham, just go check please.

18:25.308 --> 18:27.642
- [Graham] Fuck.
- [Erin] Oh, my God.

18:58.807 --> 18:59.741
[Graham]
Oh, fuck!

19:02.978 --> 19:04.247
[whispering]
I've not been through there.

19:19.728 --> 19:20.695
Fuck.

19:29.539 --> 19:30.839
What the fuck?

20:09.445 --> 20:10.845
What the fuck?

20:11.846 --> 20:14.383
[creepy music]

20:16.818 --> 20:18.421
[Erin]
<i>Graham lived on the third floor.</i>

20:20.489 --> 20:23.025
<i>The front door was
locked from the inside.</i>

20:25.161 --> 20:28.197
[creepy music]

20:29.898 --> 20:32.301
<i>That video made a believer
out of a lot of people.</i>

20:34.570 --> 20:37.340
People that were unsure before.

20:41.143 --> 20:43.845
[creepy music]

20:45.014 --> 20:47.016
[sighs] Erin, I think
we need professional help.

20:47.882 --> 20:49.518
And I've got someone in mind.

20:52.021 --> 20:55.258
[upbeat music]

20:55.291 --> 20:58.427
This, this is ghost hunting.

21:00.296 --> 21:03.032
So, I've got 120,000
YouTube subscribers.

21:04.100 --> 21:06.535
I'm getting a lot of vibes
from different areas,

21:06.569 --> 21:09.938
all sorts here, there's a lot of ghosts here,
there's a lot of people been killed here.

21:09.971 --> 21:11.374
Nine million views.

21:11.407 --> 21:14.043
We managed to capture
it on film, we got it.

21:15.111 --> 21:17.480
This is very good evidence.

21:17.513 --> 21:19.248
One at a time, you go first.

21:19.282 --> 21:22.951
<i>♪ Don't matter much

21:22.984 --> 21:23.985
<i>♪ Now listen to me

21:24.020 --> 21:25.588
I've got 10,000 Insta followers.

21:25.621 --> 21:26.988
Look at that, somebody's...

21:27.922 --> 21:29.091
tried to...

21:30.393 --> 21:32.461
make this seem...

21:32.495 --> 21:35.598
a benign place by putting
a smiley face here, but...

21:36.599 --> 21:38.967
it's far from benign.

21:39.001 --> 21:41.070
That's obviously not a ghost.

21:42.171 --> 21:44.040
Oh, I've got a lot
of Twitter fans.

21:44.073 --> 21:46.841
A lot, we're talking
10,000, 12,000.

21:48.210 --> 21:49.211

21:53.915 --> 21:54.983
We got it.

21:56.018 --> 21:58.254
Doing, doing all right.

21:58.287 --> 22:01.090
And I was a big deal
even before Graham

22:01.123 --> 22:02.058
started out.

22:05.927 --> 22:10.566
So during the 1920s, this place
was rumored to have a contagion

22:10.599 --> 22:12.535
which led to mass hysteria,

22:12.568 --> 22:14.537
that's why it's
shut down just now.

22:14.570 --> 22:16.472
Local legend now says,

22:16.505 --> 22:18.674
"Don't even bring
your dogs here,

22:18.708 --> 22:20.276
if you let them off the lead,

22:20.309 --> 22:22.844
they come in as if something's
drawing them in."

22:25.314 --> 22:26.948
And the dogs
are never seen again.

22:26.981 --> 22:28.117
[crow cawing]

22:29.951 --> 22:31.087
Although I can see them.

22:36.125 --> 22:38.060
[indistinct sound]

22:38.094 --> 22:39.095
Tell me you got that.

22:47.636 --> 22:48.571
Be calm, Stuart.

22:49.472 --> 22:51.973
- [wings fluttering]
- [yells]

22:53.142 --> 22:54.876
We need to cut the last part.

22:57.179 --> 22:58.880
[sighs]

23:04.019 --> 23:05.688
Basically, right,
obviously I've seen

23:05.721 --> 23:07.556
a lot of paranormal
activity in my time.

23:07.590 --> 23:09.558
But Graham's videos
were a little bit...

23:10.559 --> 23:13.028
[hums] on the nose.

23:13.062 --> 23:16.065
I mean, as a ghost hunter,
you're talking about

23:16.098 --> 23:18.334
if you hear a sound
or a spirit orb even,

23:18.367 --> 23:20.169
you, you're getting lucky.

23:20.202 --> 23:21.704
So...

23:21.737 --> 23:24.273
Graham's videos were
a little bit more

23:24.306 --> 23:25.341
sensational.

23:26.776 --> 23:27.676
Dubious...

23:29.111 --> 23:30.012
one might say.

23:32.381 --> 23:35.317
Steve, Steve annoyed
the fuck out of me.

23:35.351 --> 23:37.420
Oh, man, um,

23:37.453 --> 23:39.054
he thought he was a big deal.

23:39.088 --> 23:42.957
No, sorry, 15,000
Instagram followers now, so.

23:42.991 --> 23:45.561
And to be honest, if Graham
hadn't had those two viral videos,

23:45.594 --> 23:48.364
I don't think he even
would have messaged us.

23:48.397 --> 23:51.066
He's, uh,
he's pretty up himself.

23:51.100 --> 23:54.036
But, you know, Graham insisted.

23:56.439 --> 23:58.607
You know, he'd been
a fan of his for years.

24:00.443 --> 24:03.612
And I guess it was good
to have someone with a bit of

24:04.513 --> 24:07.082
"experience." [chuckles]

24:08.083 --> 24:10.786
He was freaking out. He didn't understand
what he was dealing with, right?

24:10.820 --> 24:12.521
I've been around
the block before though.

24:12.555 --> 24:16.258
So, you know, I was happy
to hear him out, I wanted to,

24:16.292 --> 24:17.726
to hear his experience.

24:18.828 --> 24:20.596
[interviewer]
Okay.

24:20.629 --> 24:23.599
- Steve. Nice to meet you, thanks for coming out.
- Graham.

24:23.632 --> 24:26.435
- No worries.
- I thought we could film this for posterity.

24:27.403 --> 24:29.472
Well, I like where
your head's at and,

24:29.505 --> 24:31.307
it's good to meet you and Erin.

24:31.340 --> 24:32.475
[Erin]
Hey.

24:32.508 --> 24:34.577
Yeah, no worries.

24:34.610 --> 24:36.645
Oh, have a seat, by the way.

24:36.679 --> 24:38.113
Uh, okay.

24:38.147 --> 24:39.715
Um, do you like my house?

24:39.748 --> 24:41.517
[laughs]

24:41.550 --> 24:44.019
- You grew up in places like this, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

24:44.053 --> 24:46.489
So, yeah, I mean,

24:46.522 --> 24:48.491
you've seen the videos, right?

24:48.524 --> 24:51.160
- The ones...
- Yeah, they're good, they're good, they're promising.

24:51.193 --> 24:53.829
So do you think there's
something paranormal

24:53.863 --> 24:55.331
going on in our flat?

24:55.364 --> 24:57.766
I mean, we've watched
it a lot, uh.

24:57.800 --> 25:00.069
There's something
definitely weird going on.

25:00.102 --> 25:02.204
Right, I've been doing
this job for ten years,

25:02.238 --> 25:04.740
I've never seen anything
quite like that.

25:05.841 --> 25:08.143
That's what we thought as well.

25:08.177 --> 25:11.313
Yeah, I mean, there's definitely
something going on.

25:11.347 --> 25:14.183
Well, I guess
the bottom line is, um...

25:15.251 --> 25:18.354
do you think you would,
you know,

25:18.387 --> 25:20.556
be able to help us
investigate it?

25:20.589 --> 25:23.425
Maybe collaborate
on some videos?

25:23.459 --> 25:25.060
Do some cross promotion
sort of stuff.

25:25.094 --> 25:26.495
Graham, definitely.

25:26.529 --> 25:30.566
Listen, I don't think
there's a bigger priority

25:30.599 --> 25:32.434
in the paranormal world
than figuring out

25:32.468 --> 25:34.570
what's in your flat right now.

25:34.603 --> 25:36.872
- [sighs]
- It's, it's weird.

25:36.906 --> 25:38.607
Yeah, I didn't realize
what a relief

25:38.641 --> 25:41.110
that would be to hear
until I actually heard it.

25:41.143 --> 25:42.378
Mate, no problem, man.

25:42.411 --> 25:44.179
Great. [chuckles]

25:44.213 --> 25:45.614
We'll get to the bottom of this.

25:45.648 --> 25:47.349
- Thanks.
- We'll find the truth.

25:47.383 --> 25:48.684
Which we always do.

25:48.717 --> 25:50.786
Let's hunt some
motherfucking ghosts.

25:52.454 --> 25:54.456
That was a bit too far,
but okay.

26:15.578 --> 26:17.546
[Steve] Listen,
I can tell you right now...

26:19.348 --> 26:21.617
that thing in your flat,
whatever it is,

26:21.650 --> 26:23.252
that's a money making machine.

26:24.787 --> 26:26.488
You just need a bit
of business savvy about it,

26:26.522 --> 26:27.790
I can provide that.

26:29.792 --> 26:31.327
Honestly, we'll be making some

26:31.360 --> 26:34.563
seriously fucking
hard cash that way.

26:34.597 --> 26:35.664
[Erin]
That's a little bit crass,

26:35.698 --> 26:36.599
but I have been saying that

26:36.632 --> 26:38.133
to Graham for weeks now.

26:39.602 --> 26:42.338
[Graham]
I mean, I definitely want that.

26:42.371 --> 26:44.406
But we're going to uncover
the truth of it

26:44.440 --> 26:46.308
along the way, right?

26:46.342 --> 26:47.710
[Steve]
Aye, right, of course, you know,

26:47.743 --> 26:50.779
paranormal investigating
is for life, man, but,

26:50.813 --> 26:54.249
you know,
"hashtag fucking fake news."

26:54.283 --> 26:56.685
You know what I mean?
The audience are into clickbait,

26:56.719 --> 26:58.887
spectacle, and shaming people.

26:58.921 --> 27:00.823
We can provide the first two,

27:00.856 --> 27:02.725
if the truth is revealed
along the way,

27:02.758 --> 27:04.126
that's just a bonus, right?

27:06.395 --> 27:07.896
[Graham] Oh, shit,
your mic's still on, hold on.

27:07.930 --> 27:09.365
[Steve]
Oh, get it off me.

27:10.766 --> 27:12.434
[Steve on record] <i>If the truth
is revealed along the way,</i>

27:12.468 --> 27:13.636
<i>that's just a bonus, right?</i>

27:15.904 --> 27:17.640
[Graham on record] <i>Oh, shit,
your mic's still on, hold on.</i>

27:17.673 --> 27:18.841
[Steve on record]
<i>Oh, get it off me.</i>

27:21.877 --> 27:22.778
Listen.

27:23.979 --> 27:26.415
My work speaks for itself, okay?

27:27.516 --> 27:30.219
Secondly, in regards to

27:30.252 --> 27:31.787
what I said about

27:31.820 --> 27:33.422
your average internet user...

27:34.423 --> 27:36.859
everything after
what happened with Graham

27:36.892 --> 27:38.894
and this whole mess,

27:38.927 --> 27:41.730
can you really say that

27:41.764 --> 27:44.600
I'm not justified
in what I said?

27:46.935 --> 27:50.239
Was what I said wrong,
after everything that Graham went through?

27:54.710 --> 27:55.811
That's what I make of that.

27:59.682 --> 28:03.519
So, that was the start
of our work with Steve.

28:03.552 --> 28:07.189
And his first suggestion
was really out there.

28:09.591 --> 28:11.794
He suggested... [sighs]

28:13.562 --> 28:15.264
Seance.

28:15.297 --> 28:19.568
First ever 360 degree
live streamed seance,

28:19.601 --> 28:20.869
never been done before.

28:20.903 --> 28:23.305
So, if Graham and Erin's place

28:23.338 --> 28:25.641
was really a hotbed
of paranormal activity,

28:26.608 --> 28:29.311
we're talking internet gold.

28:29.344 --> 28:30.979
Right?
That's what we're talking.

28:31.847 --> 28:33.582
And even I underestimated it.

28:35.584 --> 28:37.020
Which was unfortunate
for Graham.

28:39.621 --> 28:41.623
Yeah, kind of backfired on him.

28:54.903 --> 28:57.940
[clock ticking]

29:06.615 --> 29:08.051
- [Steve] Right.
- [Graham] Okay,

29:08.084 --> 29:10.452
okay, yeah.

29:10.486 --> 29:13.822
And camera's on.

29:15.891 --> 29:18.694
Have we got enough
candles now, Steve?

29:18.727 --> 29:19.795
[Erin chuckles]

29:19.828 --> 29:22.898
Um, no, I don't, actually.

29:25.601 --> 29:28.004
Okay, is everyone ready to go?

29:28.037 --> 29:29.571
- [Graham] Yup.
- [Erin] I'm ready.

29:29.605 --> 29:32.808
Uh, once I hit live,
that's it, we're live.

29:33.942 --> 29:35.811
Ready? Yeah, okay.

29:37.446 --> 29:39.681
And we're live, hello,
fellow followers.

29:39.715 --> 29:42.518
Uh, I'm doing a conjoined stream
here with special guest,

29:42.551 --> 29:45.521
uh, special guest
Graham and Erin.

29:45.554 --> 29:50.526
And this is the first ever
VR live streamed seance.

29:51.426 --> 29:56.532
That's right,
we have our 360 degree VR camera

29:56.565 --> 29:58.767
in the middle of the room,
which means it captures

29:58.801 --> 30:01.370
all 360 degrees of this room,

30:01.403 --> 30:03.072
so if anything spooky

30:03.106 --> 30:05.674
or paranormal happens,

30:05.707 --> 30:07.609
this camera will see it.

30:07.643 --> 30:11.446
Exactly, so, if you like
this video, please like it.

30:11.480 --> 30:14.050
Subscribe or comment,
we're on Instagram,

30:14.083 --> 30:16.785
we're on Twitter,
we're on YouTube.

30:16.819 --> 30:18.954
Okay, now that's out of the way,
we can seance it up.

30:18.987 --> 30:21.456
- And, uh...
- Seance it up. [chuckles]

30:21.490 --> 30:22.925
[Steve]
Yes, it's a Victorian saying.

30:24.060 --> 30:25.961
- [Erin] Sorry.
- [Steve] Right. Okay.

30:25.994 --> 30:28.630
So, yep, Steve,
you're the expert,

30:28.664 --> 30:30.465
do you want
to walk us through this

30:30.499 --> 30:32.101
- lovely set up we have here?
- [Steve] Yes.

30:32.135 --> 30:34.736
So basically,
we've got a lot of candles,

30:34.770 --> 30:37.906
it's almost midnight,
we've got a quiet room.

30:37.940 --> 30:40.509
Uh, these are all good
prerequisites.

30:40.542 --> 30:41.910
Uh, phones are off?

30:41.944 --> 30:43.378
- [Graham] Yes.
- [Erin] Yep.

30:43.412 --> 30:44.413
- Phone's off.
- [Steve] Okay, great.

30:44.446 --> 30:45.480
And Steve, can you tell us a bit

30:45.514 --> 30:47.016
about why we're using whisky?

30:47.050 --> 30:48.450
No.

30:49.484 --> 30:50.819
That'll be explained later.

30:52.222 --> 30:56.159
Okay, so, now, all we need to do

30:57.093 --> 30:59.394
is... well, first off,

30:59.428 --> 31:01.064
get your hands
on the table please.

31:01.997 --> 31:03.932
This grounds us
to the physical realm.

31:07.136 --> 31:09.038
I'm going to read this prayer,

31:09.072 --> 31:10.606
which is going to protect us,

31:10.639 --> 31:12.441
it's hopefully going
to get the spirits...

31:13.742 --> 31:14.643
out...

31:15.677 --> 31:16.845
or in this room.

31:19.082 --> 31:20.883
"In the name of God,
Jesus Christ...

31:21.850 --> 31:23.685
the great brotherhood of light,

31:23.719 --> 31:25.021
please protect us from

31:25.054 --> 31:26.722
the forces of evil
during this session.

31:27.689 --> 31:30.459
Let there be nothing but
light surrounding this table,

31:30.492 --> 31:33.662
and its participants,
and let us only communicate

31:33.695 --> 31:35.664
with powers
and entities of light.

31:36.965 --> 31:39.835
Protect us, protect this house,

31:39.868 --> 31:42.704
the people in this house,
and let there only be light

31:42.738 --> 31:45.041
and nothing but light, amen."

31:48.077 --> 31:51.114
[clock ticking]

31:55.251 --> 31:57.786
So spirit, if you're here,
please let us know.

32:02.225 --> 32:04.127
Is something supposed to happen?

32:06.262 --> 32:07.930
I'm hoping, uh...

32:08.830 --> 32:14.003
Spirit, if you're here,
please, please, let us know.

32:14.037 --> 32:15.138
Use the whisky.

32:19.208 --> 32:21.777
- Should we maybe...
- [whiskey drips]

32:24.613 --> 32:25.714
Did someone push the table?

32:25.747 --> 32:27.482
[Erin chuckles] No.

32:31.154 --> 32:32.654
- Okay.
- [whisky drips]

32:32.688 --> 32:34.489
Oh, my God.

32:34.523 --> 32:37.260
- [Graham] Oh, my God.
- Fuck!

32:37.293 --> 32:39.461
Sit down,
don't break the circle.

32:46.535 --> 32:50.039
That's... incredible.

32:51.307 --> 32:53.775
Okay, spirit,
who are we speaking to?

32:55.777 --> 32:57.180
[lamp clatters]

32:57.213 --> 32:58.580
- [Erin] Fuck.
- [Graham] Jesus.

33:03.785 --> 33:05.687
What's it doing,
why's it coming?

33:07.223 --> 33:10.259
[ominous sound]

33:27.642 --> 33:28.710
- Fuck!
- [growling]

33:28.744 --> 33:30.246
- Oh, my God!
- [growling]

33:39.022 --> 33:40.856
You guys saw that, right?

33:40.889 --> 33:41.790
[Steve]
Yeah.

33:43.992 --> 33:46.795
[mystical music]

33:47.696 --> 33:50.999
I assumed there'd been some
sort of trickery, something,

33:51.034 --> 33:52.567
he'd managed
to work something out

33:52.601 --> 33:53.802
that he thought was quite good,

33:53.835 --> 33:56.172
but, um,
I couldn't figure it out.

33:58.341 --> 34:00.209
Well, the reaction
was even bigger

34:00.243 --> 34:02.544
than all of the other
videos put together.

34:03.413 --> 34:05.981
I had to call him straight away,
it was just crazy.

34:07.649 --> 34:09.784
I think people just
wanted confirmation.

34:11.753 --> 34:13.322
And they got it.

34:13.356 --> 34:14.889
Did you see this video?

34:14.922 --> 34:17.793
This is completely fucked up.

34:17.826 --> 34:20.562
[mystical music]

34:22.065 --> 34:23.399
Well, I underestimated it.

34:23.433 --> 34:26.369
Genuinely had trouble
sleeping last night.

34:26.402 --> 34:29.838
Who is this guy? That ghost's
some scary ass shit, boy.

34:29.871 --> 34:32.974
[mystical music]

34:33.009 --> 34:35.378
Well, it was by far
my most successful video,

34:35.411 --> 34:37.579
um, even to this day, um.

34:38.847 --> 34:40.715
It was the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

34:42.118 --> 34:43.784
I thought.

34:43.819 --> 34:46.222
[sighs] Well, I mean,
the fact that anyone

34:46.255 --> 34:48.956
over the age of five thought
these hauntings were real,

34:48.989 --> 34:52.726
um, just sums up what's
wrong with society today.

34:52.761 --> 34:54.297
[sighs]

34:57.233 --> 35:00.702
It was clearly just three people
making short horror films,

35:00.735 --> 35:02.737
and I've got
nothing against horror,

35:02.771 --> 35:05.841
but the fact that they were
presenting it as real,

35:05.874 --> 35:08.877
manipulating people,
taking them in,

35:08.910 --> 35:10.912
there were some people
that really bought it,

35:10.946 --> 35:12.315
and it really hurt them.

35:12.348 --> 35:16.219
I, I've got some comments
on some of their videos.

35:17.919 --> 35:19.055
Right, here.

35:23.092 --> 35:26.661
Okay. "This is amazing,
I always suspected,

35:26.695 --> 35:28.663
my husband passed
away three years ago,

35:28.697 --> 35:30.699
can you help me get in touch?"

35:30.732 --> 35:33.402
This one, "Graham, Steve, Erin,

35:33.436 --> 35:35.271
thanks for showing
everyone the truth,

35:35.304 --> 35:37.039
now I can talk
to my dead grandparents

35:37.073 --> 35:39.275
at night knowing I'm not crazy."

35:39.308 --> 35:41.344
I mean,
they weren't helping anyone.

35:42.777 --> 35:44.113
Look at this one, uh,

35:44.147 --> 35:46.315
"Please, please,
help me talk to my mom,

35:46.349 --> 35:48.884
she passed in April,
I know you can help me,

35:48.917 --> 35:50.353
please respond to my messages."

35:50.386 --> 35:52.355
That one really breaks my heart.

35:55.824 --> 35:58.394
It really got on my nerves,
to be honest.

35:58.427 --> 36:02.831
Um, I sort of developed
a bit of a grudge against them.

36:02.864 --> 36:06.435
I really wanted to just
prove them and...

36:06.469 --> 36:07.203
[chuckles]

36:08.504 --> 36:10.106
Do you know what,
I can show you.

36:11.307 --> 36:13.142
- [birds chirping]
- [doorbell rings]

36:18.014 --> 36:20.815
Hi, sorry, you're early,
just come through.

36:21.850 --> 36:23.818
Um, you can set up in there.

36:23.852 --> 36:25.987
Uh, make yourselves comfortable.

36:55.418 --> 36:58.454
[footsteps approaching]

36:59.522 --> 37:01.424
It's pretty tacky, right?

37:01.457 --> 37:02.991
[cameraperson]
What is it?

37:03.025 --> 37:05.228
It's a souvenir from
my first big debunk case.

37:06.429 --> 37:08.064
[cameraperson]
What happened?

37:08.097 --> 37:11.200
Well, these newlyweds
had moved into a new flat,

37:11.234 --> 37:13.469
and they found
this doll in the attic.

37:13.502 --> 37:15.338
Understandably,
they found it a bit creepy,

37:15.371 --> 37:16.539
so they left it there.

37:17.673 --> 37:21.043
After a while, they started
to hear strange noises,

37:21.077 --> 37:22.578
scratching, scraping,

37:22.612 --> 37:26.082
sort of sounded like
little feet in the attic, um.

37:27.149 --> 37:28.984
Then things
got even weirder, because

37:29.018 --> 37:32.321
they started to find the doll
in random places in the flat.

37:32.355 --> 37:35.458
Uh, it would show up in
cupboards, washing up baskets,

37:35.491 --> 37:38.027
and both of them insisted
they weren't moving it.

37:38.927 --> 37:40.496
[cameraperson]
So how did you get involved?

37:40.529 --> 37:42.897
Well, they recorded the case,

37:42.931 --> 37:45.534
and uploaded the videos,
um, like Graham's,

37:45.568 --> 37:49.071
and when I saw them,
I just wanted

37:49.105 --> 37:51.173
to get to the bottom of it, so,

37:51.207 --> 37:56.012
did some digging,
and I figured it out,

37:56.045 --> 37:57.912
it was the dog walker.

37:57.946 --> 38:01.250
The dog walker had also seen
some of their initial videos,

38:01.284 --> 38:03.952
and thought it was a great
chance to fuck with them.

38:03.985 --> 38:05.221
So whenever they were out,

38:05.254 --> 38:06.489
the dog walker would
move the doll

38:06.522 --> 38:08.190
to different places.

38:09.058 --> 38:11.027
So, once I figured it out,
of course,

38:11.060 --> 38:12.295
they fired the dog walker.

38:13.296 --> 38:15.298
And that was it, that simple.

38:15.331 --> 38:16.599
[cameraperson]
And what about the sounds?

38:16.632 --> 38:17.866
It's just rats.

38:17.899 --> 38:19.502
There's always an explanation.

38:21.137 --> 38:25.974
That said, um,
they still didn't 100% believe

38:26.008 --> 38:28.877
that the doll
was just a harmless doll.

38:28.910 --> 38:32.281
Uh, so they asked me
to take it off their hands,

38:32.315 --> 38:34.350
and now I keep it
on my mantelpiece,

38:34.383 --> 38:36.252
like my own little
personal Annabelle.

38:37.687 --> 38:39.355
Anyways, come and look at this,

38:39.388 --> 38:42.924
this is the footage
that I had ready for you.

38:42.957 --> 38:46.429
Okay, um, so you have to look
pretty carefully here.

38:46.462 --> 38:48.230
Watch the mug, okay?

38:48.264 --> 38:50.433
[ominous music]

38:50.466 --> 38:51.933
There, okay?

38:51.966 --> 38:53.502
Did you see that?

38:53.536 --> 38:55.004
There, can you see it?

38:58.973 --> 39:00.476
[Graham]
<i>Erin?</i>

39:00.509 --> 39:02.244
[Alice]
There. Did you get that?

39:10.219 --> 39:11.587
It's a wire.

39:11.620 --> 39:14.123
Which means that
this wasn't shot live at all.

39:15.224 --> 39:18.094
So if that was faked,
what else was?

39:18.127 --> 39:19.161
[crashing]

39:20.429 --> 39:23.932
[chuckles] Things keep
falling off that shelf.

39:23.965 --> 39:26.702
I like to joke that
the doll doesn't really like

39:26.736 --> 39:28.870
sharing the space
with other ornaments.

39:30.039 --> 39:33.109
[cameraperson] Am I being stupid, or has
that doll moved since we've been here?

39:34.410 --> 39:36.579
[Alice chuckles]
I don't think so.

39:36.612 --> 39:37.912
It's just a doll.

39:45.654 --> 39:48.057
[squeaking]

39:48.090 --> 39:50.359
[cameraperson] I don't know if the mic's
picking that up, can you hear that?

39:51.260 --> 39:54.296
[squeaking]

40:01.970 --> 40:02.971
I think it stopped.

40:03.905 --> 40:06.108

- [cameraperson] Jesus Christ.

40:06.142 --> 40:07.410
[Alice laughs]

40:07.443 --> 40:09.944
I'm sorry, guys,
I couldn't help myself.

40:09.978 --> 40:11.614
Just wanted to make a point.

40:11.647 --> 40:14.316
You see, it's really easy
to fake stuff like this.

40:15.317 --> 40:16.652
The doll's remote controlled.

40:17.620 --> 40:19.422
I've got a speaker
on the mantelpiece,

40:19.455 --> 40:24.059
and I also included a little
mechanism that pushes her off.

40:24.093 --> 40:26.295
It's so easy to fool people,

40:26.328 --> 40:28.431
and that's why I wanted to

40:28.464 --> 40:31.233
show everyone what people
like Graham are doing.

40:32.201 --> 40:34.136
[cameraperson] So was the story
about the dog walkers true?

40:35.104 --> 40:36.005
No.

40:38.707 --> 40:41.610
[fabric rustling]

40:43.712 --> 40:44.747
I think I've got it.

40:44.780 --> 40:46.282
<i>Steve and Graham agreed</i>

40:46.315 --> 40:47.750
<i>to have a meeting with me.</i>

40:47.783 --> 40:49.285

I wanted to write a piece</i>

40:49.318 --> 40:50.753
<i>promoting their work.</i>

40:50.786 --> 40:54.023
Of course, they believed me,
their big egos.

40:54.056 --> 40:55.691
Yeah, what was
that reporter lady's name?

40:55.724 --> 40:57.126
[interviewer]
Alice Harper.

40:57.159 --> 40:58.427
Yeah, Alice Harper,
right, so anyway,

40:58.461 --> 41:00.529
she's wanting
an interview with Graham.

41:00.563 --> 41:03.732
She's into debunking
paranormal investigators,

41:03.766 --> 41:06.168
internet fraudsters,
that's her business.

41:06.202 --> 41:09.171
So, obviously she's going
to try and, you know,

41:09.205 --> 41:10.706
debunk us, even though you can't

41:10.739 --> 41:13.442
debunk somebody who's legit,
who's, uh,

41:13.476 --> 41:16.479
unbunked, so, you know,
I don't know why.

41:16.512 --> 41:18.514
But anyway, I told Graham,

41:18.547 --> 41:19.815
"Let's do this,

41:19.849 --> 41:22.318
we'll fucking beat her
at her own game."

41:29.158 --> 41:32.761
<i>I cut a hole in a pencil case,

What I didn't count on, which,

41:41.737 --> 41:43.772
in hindsight should have
been fucking obvious,

41:43.806 --> 41:46.775
is that Graham and Steve
planned on doing

41:46.809 --> 41:48.511
a little bit
of filming of their own.

41:48.544 --> 41:50.412
[jazzy music]

41:50.446 --> 41:53.048
[music intensifies]

42:08.230 --> 42:11.066
Do you guys mind if I take
some notes while we do this?

42:11.100 --> 42:14.069
No, as long as you don't mind
us filming the interview.

42:14.103 --> 42:15.571
No, fire away, okay.

42:16.472 --> 42:17.506
Uh, so...

42:18.774 --> 42:20.175
It was fucking mind games,

42:20.209 --> 42:22.211
they were trying
to throw me off.

42:22.244 --> 42:25.214
Graham, what do you make
of these allegations

42:25.247 --> 42:29.518
that you, Erin, and Steve have
been faking these hauntings?

42:29.552 --> 42:31.120
- [Graham] Well...
- Preposterous.

42:31.153 --> 42:33.422
Thanks Steve,
I was actually asking Graham.

42:33.455 --> 42:35.157
Yeah, Steve, it's okay.

42:35.190 --> 42:37.726
I mean, this footage,
if it's genuine,

42:37.760 --> 42:41.463
is perhaps one of the most
amazing things I've ever seen.

42:41.497 --> 42:43.365
- Thank you.
- [Alice] Earth shattering,

42:43.399 --> 42:45.768
some might say
it beggars belief.

42:46.635 --> 42:48.837
Well, sometimes
I wish it wasn't true.

42:48.871 --> 42:50.606
You know, a lot of people
don't realize

42:50.639 --> 42:53.676
that this has been more
of a curse than anything else.

42:53.709 --> 42:56.545
Yeah, well, sometimes when
people find fame and fortune,

42:56.579 --> 42:58.547
they realize it's not
everything they wanted.

42:59.915 --> 43:01.383
You know that's
not what I meant.

43:03.185 --> 43:05.454
Look, I've been researching you,

43:05.487 --> 43:08.657
and you weren't always into
this ghost hunting shit,

43:08.691 --> 43:09.925
or whatever you want to call it.

43:09.959 --> 43:12.795
We're paranormal investigators

43:12.828 --> 43:15.264
and extra-dimensional experts.

43:15.297 --> 43:17.166
That's what we are,
you need to do some research

43:17.199 --> 43:18.601
before you start interviewing,

43:18.634 --> 43:20.669
- just a thought...
- Thank you, thank you, Steve.

43:20.703 --> 43:21.637
Okay.

43:22.671 --> 43:24.173
You've tried every trend going,

43:24.206 --> 43:25.841
I've even seen
your planking videos.

43:28.377 --> 43:29.411
Did you like them?

43:29.445 --> 43:31.413
[chuckles]

43:31.447 --> 43:33.182
This is what I think's happened.

43:34.750 --> 43:35.884
You played a prank,

43:36.819 --> 43:39.154
it was successful,
it went viral.

43:39.188 --> 43:40.289
You liked how it felt,

43:40.322 --> 43:41.857
and that's why you got involved

43:41.890 --> 43:45.227
with this two-bit
"quasi-celebrity" over here.

43:45.260 --> 43:46.595
Now wait a minute.

43:46.629 --> 43:48.330
I've got a question.

43:48.364 --> 43:51.367
Why did you use air quotes
when you said celebrity?

43:54.236 --> 43:56.438
Have either of you guys looked
into an internet shaming?

43:58.008 --> 44:01.210
Because, you know,
if you are faking this,

44:01.243 --> 44:03.345
then you've got a massive
shaming coming your way,

44:03.379 --> 44:05.347
and it is not going
to be pretty.

44:07.249 --> 44:08.183
[sighs]

44:08.217 --> 44:09.752
This is your interview?

44:10.686 --> 44:13.222
You, you're just telling
us things.

44:13.255 --> 44:14.556
Plus you're not
writing anything down,

44:14.590 --> 44:16.992
I told you what exactly
our jobs are,

44:17.027 --> 44:18.460
you didn't write that down.

44:18.494 --> 44:19.495
[Alice]
That's okay, Steve, I think

44:19.528 --> 44:20.963
I've got everything I need.

44:20.996 --> 44:22.297
I'm going to get the bill.

44:24.299 --> 44:25.534
[footsteps receding]

44:31.540 --> 44:33.308
I have read up on shamings, man,

44:33.342 --> 44:35.611
and they are fucking brutal.

44:35.644 --> 44:38.981
Right, don't worry
about that, okay?

44:39.015 --> 44:41.784
- Yeah, but what if they...
- Don't worry about it, okay?

44:41.817 --> 44:44.920
Just, we've got a good
thing going on here, just chill.

44:44.953 --> 44:46.989
Yeah, but if they fucking find
out we've been faking it,

44:47.023 --> 44:48.924
then we're going
to be in so much shit.

44:54.530 --> 44:55.531
That was...

44:57.399 --> 45:00.736
probably the most satisfying
moment of my career.

45:01.804 --> 45:02.805
I mean...

45:04.606 --> 45:06.942
I uploaded the video that night,

45:06.975 --> 45:09.478
and got a little
viral fame of my own.

45:09.511 --> 45:11.246
Don't worry about it, okay?

45:11.280 --> 45:14.316
Just, we've got a good thing
going on here, just chill.

45:14.349 --> 45:16.418
Yeah, but if they fucking find
out we've been faking it,

45:16.452 --> 45:17.986
then we're going
to be in so much shit.

Ha, whoops,
he didn't see that one coming.

45:27.863 --> 45:30.066
I feel so betrayed.

45:30.100 --> 45:31.734
Graham deserved his comeuppance.

45:31.767 --> 45:33.036
He's shitting himself.

45:33.069 --> 45:34.670
He looks more scared now
than he did

45:34.703 --> 45:36.072
when he thought
he'd seen a ghost.

45:36.106 --> 45:37.806
Graham...

45:37.840 --> 45:40.909
went off on a massive
spiral at that point.

45:40.943 --> 45:42.444
Just go kill yourself.

45:42.478 --> 45:44.313
You guys,
this is from the heart...

45:45.314 --> 45:47.549
I really thought that
for once there was proof,

45:47.583 --> 45:49.485
you have no idea what
that meant to me.

45:50.419 --> 45:51.754
Steve got off okay.

45:51.787 --> 45:54.423
No backlash for me,
no backlash for me.

45:55.557 --> 45:57.926
I wasn't in the spotlight
as much, so.

45:59.095 --> 46:01.030
All my followers,

46:01.064 --> 46:04.366
they know my work
is 100% authentic.

46:04.399 --> 46:05.868
He was asking for it.

46:05.901 --> 46:08.470
I can't believe I didn't
do it sooner, to be honest.

46:08.504 --> 46:11.573
They knew that I was just
getting tied into some kind of

46:11.607 --> 46:12.808
dubious stuff.

I mean, for God's sakes,

I got death threats,
rape threats,

46:30.126 --> 46:31.627
for writing an article
on cheesecake,

46:31.660 --> 46:33.362
you don't see me
crying about it.

46:34.563 --> 46:36.465
Steve left him out to dry.

46:37.633 --> 46:39.635
It's funny, all the focus
seemed to be on Graham...

46:40.769 --> 46:42.938
I mean, I guess he was
the instigator, but...

46:45.074 --> 46:45.974
I was lucky.

46:46.909 --> 46:48.544
I don't really have
an online presence,

46:48.577 --> 46:50.579
I was only in a few
of the videos, so.

46:51.547 --> 46:53.482
[interviewer] And you knew
it was faked from the start?

46:55.984 --> 46:56.885
Mm-hm.

46:59.055 --> 47:02.125
I see it like all of Graham's
videos, it's an art piece.

47:02.158 --> 47:05.394
It's challenging people
about what they think is real,

47:05.427 --> 47:06.962
and what they think is not real.

47:08.864 --> 47:10.632
[interviewer] And you don't
think that's problematic?

47:13.702 --> 47:15.370
No.

47:15.404 --> 47:16.672
[mellow music]

47:16.705 --> 47:18.440
I'm glad we did it.

47:18.473 --> 47:19.842
I'm really sad to see it end.

47:22.411 --> 47:24.446
That's what I told them...

47:24.479 --> 47:27.083
[Erin] <i>The fallout for
Graham was terrible.</i>

47:27.116 --> 47:28.617

<i>He just became

<i>The things that people
would say to him,</i>

47:34.923 --> 47:37.126
<i>they'd say to him online.</i>

47:37.160 --> 47:38.427
- Fuck.
- [thud]

47:40.196 --> 47:41.563
Can you stop filming?

47:44.533 --> 47:45.434
Please.

47:47.036 --> 47:48.637
And then came the apology.

47:50.206 --> 47:52.808
Graham had been reading a book
about public shaming,

47:52.841 --> 47:55.178
and in the book the person
had apologized,

47:55.211 --> 47:57.980
and everyone accepted
the apology,

47:58.014 --> 48:00.149
and everything was fine again.

48:00.183 --> 48:02.517
So Graham thought
he would do the same.

48:02.551 --> 48:04.620
Even though I said to him,
"Just let it blow over."

48:05.654 --> 48:07.789
But Graham is very
single minded.

48:07.823 --> 48:09.192
And he did it anyway.

48:09.225 --> 48:12.794
[mellow music]

48:17.866 --> 48:20.636
As most of you know,
it was revealed last week

48:20.669 --> 48:22.738
that the recent spate
of hauntings that were

48:22.771 --> 48:25.241
recorded and documented
in this flat

48:25.275 --> 48:26.909
were faked by myself,

48:26.942 --> 48:28.177
with the help of some others.

48:29.945 --> 48:32.781
I want to apologize from
the bottom of my heart

48:32.814 --> 48:33.982
for misleading all of you.

48:36.252 --> 48:38.487
I understand that some of you
were questioning your faith

48:38.520 --> 48:40.189
because of these videos,

48:40.223 --> 48:42.225
and for that, I am truly sorry.

48:47.829 --> 48:49.665
It got out of hand.

48:49.698 --> 48:52.001
The moment got away from me,

48:52.035 --> 48:54.103
and I was encouraged
by those closest to me.

48:58.041 --> 48:59.975
It was never my intention
to hurt any of you.

49:01.277 --> 49:02.844
I only wanted to entertain.

49:05.547 --> 49:06.448
And I guess I failed.

49:09.052 --> 49:11.787
I just hope we can all
move on from this...

49:13.222 --> 49:14.656
and forget about this blip.

49:16.558 --> 49:17.826
I'm truly sorry.

49:20.096 --> 49:23.299
Okay, well, there's
a few things wrong there.

49:23.333 --> 49:25.867
First off, terrible apology.

49:25.901 --> 49:28.271
"I was encouraged
by those closest to me?"

49:29.172 --> 49:31.940
Why should he throw Erin
under the bus?

49:31.974 --> 49:35.011
He also tries to shift
the blame off himself.

49:35.044 --> 49:36.645
"I just wanted to entertain,

49:36.678 --> 49:38.047
and the moment
got away from me."

49:38.081 --> 49:40.615
Just admit that you lied
and go from there.

49:40.649 --> 49:42.051
None of this half-assed shit.

49:43.019 --> 49:46.521
When people found out that
he'd monetized the video...

49:46.555 --> 49:48.257
[chuckles]

49:48.291 --> 49:51.626
...that was some
major <i>schadenfreude.</i>

49:51.660 --> 49:55.031
And it was
like the internet shaming

49:55.064 --> 49:56.932
had started all over again.

49:58.334 --> 49:59.735
And then...

50:01.004 --> 50:03.572
I properly lost it over this...

50:04.307 --> 50:06.242
another ghost.

50:08.877 --> 50:11.713
<i>Well, the first thing was
the figure in the background.</i>

50:12.748 --> 50:14.816
[chuckles] <i>What was he thinking?</i>

50:14.850 --> 50:17.886
[muffled apology video]

50:19.255 --> 50:20.722
<i>And then there was the picture,</i>

50:20.756 --> 50:22.225
<i>and this was so subtle</i>

50:22.258 --> 50:23.892
<i>that I wondered why
it was done at all.</i>

50:23.925 --> 50:26.295
<i>I really don't get
his thinking on it.</i>

50:27.230 --> 50:30.066
<i>It wasn't really noticeable
at normal speed,</i>

50:30.099 --> 50:32.201
<i>but if you sped the video up.</i>

50:33.069 --> 50:36.105
[Graham speaking rapidly]

50:42.178 --> 50:43.945
I just don't get why he did it.

50:44.946 --> 50:47.983
[ominous music]

50:54.990 --> 50:56.292
[incoming message sound]

51:52.148 --> 51:54.083
[interviewer]
And did you believe him?

51:57.886 --> 51:58.987
I do now.

52:02.458 --> 52:05.094
[interviewer] So if you could just
tell us your name, occupation,

52:05.128 --> 52:08.231
and spell it, so we have it for
the onscreen graphics, please.

52:08.264 --> 52:11.467
Yeah, okay,
it's Doctor John Watson.

52:11.501 --> 52:12.968
I know, hold the jokes.

52:14.003 --> 52:17.340
It's J-O-H-N, W-A-T-S-O-N.

52:17.373 --> 52:19.641
And I'm a social psychologist.

52:20.775 --> 52:22.844
Would you like me to spell that?

52:22.878 --> 52:26.415
Yeah, so it's been well
documented that...

52:27.450 --> 52:29.418
social media is addictive.

52:29.452 --> 52:31.087
I think we all know that.

52:35.124 --> 52:40.263
<i>When you get a notification,
that little red dot appears,</i>

52:40.296 --> 52:42.697
<i>or your phone buzzes
in your pocket,</i>

52:43.466 --> 52:47.736
<i>that sends a little micro dosage
of dopamine to your brain.</i>

52:47.769 --> 52:49.038
[trumpet fanfare]

52:49.071 --> 52:52.108
It says, "Oh, this is good."

52:53.042 --> 52:55.111
<i>And in the same
way that a drug addict,</i>

52:55.144 --> 52:58.780
<i>sex addicts, gamblers,
or any form of addiction,</i>

52:58.813 --> 53:01.417
<i>the same happens
to the social media addict.</i>

53:01.450 --> 53:04.786
<i>I've found that the more
exposure, the worse it gets.</i>

53:06.522 --> 53:08.090
<i>Take someone like Graham,</i>

53:08.124 --> 53:10.992
<i>you know, he was getting dozens,
if not hundreds</i>

53:11.027 --> 53:12.994
<i>of notifications a day;</i>

53:13.029 --> 53:17.266
<i>comments, likes,
subscribers, views even.</i>

53:17.300 --> 53:21.137
<i>Each one a little parcel
of dopamine right to the brain.</i>

53:22.837 --> 53:26.542
<i>Now, what hasn't been explored
is what happens</i>

53:26.576 --> 53:29.478
<i>when the trigger that gives
you that little dopamine shot</i>

53:29.512 --> 53:31.214
<i>becomes a negative stimulus.</i>

53:32.415 --> 53:34.783
<i>Imagine, for example,
a heroin addict.</i>

53:36.018 --> 53:38.554
<i>Getting their buzz as normal,
and then all of a sudden,</i>

53:38.588 --> 53:42.724
<i>the object of their addiction,
heroin, makes them feel bad.</i>

53:43.526 --> 53:46.195
<i>Every time they inject,
it's a negative experience.</i>

53:46.229 --> 53:47.929
[distorted trumpet]

53:47.963 --> 53:49.232
[hollow banging]

53:50.932 --> 53:53.369
<i>But the issue is,
they still crave it.</i>

53:53.402 --> 53:54.903
<i>They're addicted to it,</i>

53:54.936 --> 53:57.173
<i>and they can't stop
taking the drug.</i>

53:57.206 --> 53:59.408
<i>Well, the dopamine hit
is still the same,</i>

53:59.442 --> 54:01.477
<i>but the emotions
are all negative.</i>

54:01.510 --> 54:03.079
<i>But now instead
of making them happy,</i>

54:03.112 --> 54:05.181
<i>it becomes an oppressive,</i>

54:05.214 --> 54:07.782
<i>antagonistic force
in their lives.</i>

54:07.816 --> 54:10.386
<i>When they don't have it,
they crave it, and when</i>

54:10.419 --> 54:13.089
<i>they get it, it's
a deeply negative experience.</i>

54:14.557 --> 54:17.426
That was the world that
Graham was living in.

54:17.460 --> 54:19.828
You know,
he craved social media.

54:19.861 --> 54:22.831
When he did get fulfillment,
at best,

54:22.864 --> 54:25.034
it was someone telling
him he sucked,

54:25.067 --> 54:27.969
and at worst it was someone
telling him to kill himself.

54:28.638 --> 54:30.506
It's no wonder he fell apart.

54:36.279 --> 54:38.947
I don't know
if I'll post this one.

54:39.848 --> 54:41.883
Just finding it easier
to talk to

54:41.916 --> 54:43.519
the camera than
a person right now.

54:43.552 --> 54:45.987
[clock ticking]

54:46.022 --> 54:47.023
I really fucked up.

54:48.957 --> 54:51.394
I don't know why,
why we let it go so long.

54:56.365 --> 54:57.600
Steve's abandoned me.

54:59.302 --> 55:00.935
Haven't seen Erin in a few days.

55:02.238 --> 55:05.441
And the abuse from online
is just getting worse.

55:09.045 --> 55:10.945
Things in here have
been weird as well.

55:11.647 --> 55:13.082
Still weird shit going on.

55:14.083 --> 55:16.352
Just finding things out
of place...

55:17.952 --> 55:19.188
things moving around...

55:20.922 --> 55:21.657
noises.

55:23.526 --> 55:25.594
Wonder if
someone's broken in, or

55:25.628 --> 55:27.363
maybe they saw
where I live online.

55:28.431 --> 55:29.898
Fuck knows.

55:29.931 --> 55:32.335
[whispering]

56:20.982 --> 56:22.551
- [growling]
- [Graham] Oh, my God!

56:30.659 --> 56:32.161
Welcome to the show.

56:32.194 --> 56:33.928
Back after a short break,

56:33.962 --> 56:35.698
I have very good
news for Graham.

56:35.731 --> 56:38.401
I believe
the hauntings were real.

56:39.735 --> 56:41.404
And I have proof.

56:41.437 --> 56:43.406
Now what we had before
wasn't strictly paranormal,

56:43.439 --> 56:46.742
that's fine, but
I've re-looked at the footage,

56:46.776 --> 56:50.446
and I believe there's
more to this whole story

56:50.479 --> 56:51.547
than meets the eye.

56:53.982 --> 56:55.217
This is Graham's flat,

56:55.251 --> 56:56.585
I think he'll be
very happy to see us.

56:59.221 --> 57:01.090
Hey, Graham.

57:01.123 --> 57:02.158
[shuts door]

57:05.094 --> 57:07.263
Still a little bit
down in the dumps.

57:07.296 --> 57:08.197
Maybe.

57:10.433 --> 57:13.068
- Graham, Graham, buddy.
- [knocking]

57:14.270 --> 57:16.238
Listen, I do have
something very important

57:16.272 --> 57:18.040
to show you man,
I think it'll cheer you up.

57:22.311 --> 57:26.482
[sighs] Graham, please,
open the door, trust me, man.

57:29.752 --> 57:32.354
Well, fortunately,
I actually have a set of keys

57:32.388 --> 57:33.789
that Graham gave me
whilst we were

57:33.823 --> 57:35.224
in the thick
of our investigations,

57:35.257 --> 57:36.991
which,
wouldn't normally advocate

57:37.026 --> 57:38.227
breaking into
anyone's house, but

57:38.260 --> 57:40.129
he's mentally unstable, so,

57:40.162 --> 57:43.032
you know,
we've got to help him out.

57:44.300 --> 57:45.568
Graham, we're here to help.

57:45.601 --> 57:47.203
Steve, what the fuck?

57:47.236 --> 57:48.437
Get out of my flat,
I don't want to talk to you.

57:48.471 --> 57:50.172
Right, just calm down,
all right?

57:50.206 --> 57:51.740
Trust me, you need to see this.

57:51.774 --> 57:53.309
Oh, trust you, yeah,
worked out well

57:53.342 --> 57:55.110
last time I did that, didn't it?

57:55.144 --> 57:56.412
Jesus.

57:56.445 --> 57:58.614
You know, it was his idea,
faking it.

57:58.647 --> 58:00.282
Still got your fans, I see.

58:00.316 --> 58:02.451
Wake up, people,
he's full of fucking bullshit.

58:03.719 --> 58:04.787
[Steve clears throat]

58:06.322 --> 58:09.291
Erin's told me you've
not been keeping well.

58:10.426 --> 58:11.360
Yeah, well.

58:12.828 --> 58:15.564
She said you've been seeing
things moving about the flat.

58:15.598 --> 58:18.133
[clock ticking]

58:18.167 --> 58:19.735
Been talking to Erin much,
have you?

58:19.768 --> 58:22.705
Um, well,
I'm on your side, okay?

58:23.772 --> 58:25.274
Right, okay, watch this.

58:27.176 --> 58:31.280
I'm pretty sure that there's
real hauntings here.

58:32.681 --> 58:34.517
No fucking shit.

58:34.550 --> 58:36.285
I've been telling you
that for weeks.

58:36.318 --> 58:38.153
Have you not been listening?

58:38.187 --> 58:40.589
Just because it wasn't
profitable for you?

58:40.623 --> 58:42.391
You know, you come here
with your crew,

58:43.292 --> 58:45.294
just because you finally
see that there's

58:45.327 --> 58:46.529
something in it for you.

58:48.531 --> 58:50.266
What, what am I doing,
just get out.

58:50.299 --> 58:51.700
Wait, right, wait.

58:51.734 --> 58:54.136
Okay, you need to put all
that to the side, because

58:54.169 --> 58:55.671
there is something bigger here,

58:55.704 --> 58:57.439
we need to get to
the bottom of this.

58:57.473 --> 58:59.575
Like all of earth's
wondrous mysteries,

58:59.608 --> 59:03.512
there is a big, profound,
deep meaning to this, which we can...

59:03.546 --> 59:06.215
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- Wait, just let me finish this.

59:06.248 --> 59:07.650
- Which we need to excavate...
- What?

59:07.683 --> 59:10.085
Steve, drop, drop the act.

59:10.119 --> 59:11.320
It's just you and me.

59:11.353 --> 59:13.556
Just ignore the cameras,
help me out,

59:13.589 --> 59:15.124
like, I'm going
through something here.

59:15.157 --> 59:16.525
Okay.

59:16.559 --> 59:17.693
But there is something bigger,

59:17.726 --> 59:19.194
and there is a big mystery,

59:19.228 --> 59:20.229
and we need to get
to the bottom of it.

59:20.262 --> 59:21.330
Just fucking leave.

59:25.801 --> 59:27.436
Graham, let's just talk about...

59:29.605 --> 59:31.607
Well, that didn't go very well.

59:31.640 --> 59:32.908
It couldn't have gone
any better, I mean,

59:32.942 --> 59:35.344
we had
one million views on YouTube.

59:35.377 --> 59:37.646
I think we called it like,
"Shamed Ghost Hunter Freaks Out,"

59:37.680 --> 59:39.181
it did really well,

59:39.214 --> 59:41.150
because he was acting
like an asshole.

59:41.183 --> 59:43.118
Which is always good on YouTube.

59:43.152 --> 59:45.654
[interviewer] So you have
evidence of the hauntings, then?

59:45.688 --> 59:46.855
Can we see that footage?

59:48.324 --> 59:51.894
Well, you can, all right,
let me just explain, so,

59:51.927 --> 59:53.829
that footage, at that point,

59:53.862 --> 59:56.131
I didn't realize
he was faking it, right?

59:56.165 --> 01:00:00.235
So, I came to him
with the footage, thinking...

01:00:00.269 --> 01:00:03.906
I gave him the benefit
of the doubt, at that point.

01:00:03.939 --> 01:00:05.708
You know, there was
some suspicious things,

01:00:05.741 --> 01:00:08.277
there was little blurs
and sounds,

01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:11.680
and, you know, at that point,
I still thought

01:00:11.714 --> 01:00:13.716
there might be
something in this.

01:00:13.749 --> 01:00:15.684
Then he slammed the door
in my face, and...

01:00:16.919 --> 01:00:19.521
I don't know why he persisted
in trying to make it look real.

01:00:21.690 --> 01:00:24.493
So... [sighs]

01:00:28.464 --> 01:00:30.666
So I'm struggling
to sleep tonight,

01:00:30.699 --> 01:00:33.235
and it's not just because
it's the 5th of November,

01:00:33.268 --> 01:00:35.671
and it sounds like the
fucking Gaza strip out there.

01:00:39.341 --> 01:00:42.778
I started looking up
the history of the flat.

01:00:42.811 --> 01:00:44.380
[fireworks crashing]

01:00:44.413 --> 01:00:46.148
Seeing if there was
any clues as to like...

01:00:47.683 --> 01:00:49.284
why this is happening.

01:00:49.318 --> 01:00:51.854
Why, why's that happening here.

01:00:51.887 --> 01:00:54.690
[suspenseful music]

01:00:54.723 --> 01:00:57.593
<i>And I found this news story
from a few years ago.</i>

01:00:57.626 --> 01:00:58.794
<i>Seven years ago.</i>

01:01:00.429 --> 01:01:02.498
<i>About this girl who used
to live in this flat.</i>

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:08.637
<i>And she was what the Japanese
would call a "Hikikomori."</i>

01:01:09.571 --> 01:01:12.408
<i>So she was basically a shut-in.</i>

01:01:12.441 --> 01:01:15.411
<i>Sometimes the other tenants
in the building would see her</i>

01:01:15.444 --> 01:01:17.413
<i>roaming the halls, or
in the stairwell or something,</i>

01:01:17.446 --> 01:01:19.815
<i>but aside from that,
she never left the building.</i>

01:01:21.051 --> 01:01:24.720
<i>Just got everything delivered,
did everything online.</i>

01:01:24.753 --> 01:01:27.723
<i>The tenants stopped
seeing her in the halls.</i>

01:01:28.924 --> 01:01:30.392
<i>And then there was a smell...</i>

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:32.795
<i>coming from her flat.</i>

01:01:34.997 --> 01:01:37.866
<i>When they finally got
the police to investigate,</i>

01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:40.235
<i>there was nothing.</i>

01:01:40.269 --> 01:01:41.303
<i>Nobody.</i>

01:01:42.337 --> 01:01:44.273
<i>The girl wasn't there.</i>

01:01:44.306 --> 01:01:45.674
<i>But the smell was.</i>

01:01:47.776 --> 01:01:48.977
<i>They never found her.</i>

01:01:51.747 --> 01:01:53.916
But that wasn't the thing
that's keeping me up.

01:01:56.518 --> 01:02:00.522
I, uh, I found
this function on street view

01:02:00.556 --> 01:02:02.458
where you can
actually look back...

01:02:03.692 --> 01:02:04.727
um...

01:02:06.729 --> 01:02:07.896
previous years.

01:02:10.799 --> 01:02:12.468
And I looked up this flat,

01:02:12.501 --> 01:02:13.702
looked up seven years ago.

01:02:15.504 --> 01:02:16.839
<i>And this is what I saw.</i>

01:02:16.872 --> 01:02:19.908
[tense sound]

01:02:25.014 --> 01:02:27.549
Just... [sighs]

01:02:27.583 --> 01:02:29.251
I feel like
I'm fucking losing it.

01:02:29.985 --> 01:02:31.954
[door closing]

01:02:34.456 --> 01:02:37.493
[indistinct noises]

01:02:41.997 --> 01:02:45.267
Well, let's go and investigate.

01:02:48.704 --> 01:02:50.405
[sighs]

01:02:50.439 --> 01:02:51.807
[whispering] Here we go again.

01:03:01.084 --> 01:03:03.086
Hello? Erin?

01:03:06.089 --> 01:03:07.790
If that's you I'm going
to fucking kill you.

01:03:08.624 --> 01:03:09.792
Not even joking.

01:03:21.403 --> 01:03:22.905
Hello?

01:03:22.938 --> 01:03:23.972
Erin?

01:03:27.177 --> 01:03:28.710
[growling]

01:03:31.446 --> 01:03:32.447
Fuck.

01:03:33.382 --> 01:03:34.950
Why is it always a sheet?

01:03:44.426 --> 01:03:45.828
You know what?

01:03:45.861 --> 01:03:47.096
Fuck this,
I'm phoning the police,

01:03:47.130 --> 01:03:48.664
and you can hunt them,
you spooky cunt.

01:03:48.697 --> 01:03:50.833
- [growling]
- [Graham screaming]

01:03:50.866 --> 01:03:52.534
[banging]

01:03:52.568 --> 01:03:55.604
[growling]

01:04:02.145 --> 01:04:04.680
- [screams]
- [growling]

01:04:05.981 --> 01:04:08.084
[birds chirping]

01:04:09.518 --> 01:04:11.020
The tale behind this building

01:04:11.054 --> 01:04:14.090
is one of addiction,
shame, and woe.

01:04:14.123 --> 01:04:16.125
McCarthy's Canal House.

01:04:17.459 --> 01:04:19.028
This is where McCarthy himself

01:04:19.062 --> 01:04:21.797
became an isolated,
paranoid obsessive.

01:04:21.830 --> 01:04:23.498
Where he basically boarded up...

01:04:23.532 --> 01:04:25.500
- Steve.
- ...every exit and entrance.

01:04:25.534 --> 01:04:27.170
- Graham, how...
- [punch]

01:04:29.805 --> 01:04:32.141
It's okay, it's okay,
just keep filming.

01:04:32.175 --> 01:04:33.809
Fuck, give me my keys back.

01:04:33.842 --> 01:04:35.444
No, what the fuck, man?

01:04:35.477 --> 01:04:37.146
- What's wrong with you?
- Give me my keys back.

01:04:38.014 --> 01:04:39.514
Keys, now.

01:04:40.515 --> 01:04:42.551
You just fucking
punched me in the face.

01:04:42.584 --> 01:04:44.020
Now why did you do that?

01:04:44.053 --> 01:04:46.122
You fucking attacked me
in my flat last night.

01:04:47.522 --> 01:04:48.258
No, I didn't.

01:04:49.491 --> 01:04:51.727
- Okay? No.
- It was you. It was you.

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:53.795
- It was you.
- I wasn't there!

01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:55.664
Look, I didn't break
into your flat, man.

01:04:55.697 --> 01:04:57.566
Look, if it wasn't you, then.

01:04:59.235 --> 01:05:00.936
Just fucking give
me my keys back.

01:05:03.172 --> 01:05:05.440
You're fucking losing it,
there you go.

01:05:05.474 --> 01:05:07.210
Don't know why you
gave me them anyway.

01:05:07.243 --> 01:05:08.877
You're losing it, man.

01:05:08.911 --> 01:05:10.712
Do you even know what's real
and what's not any more?

01:05:10.746 --> 01:05:11.847
[Graham]
It's on camera.

01:05:12.915 --> 01:05:14.616
That doesn't mean anything.

01:05:14.650 --> 01:05:15.984
[Graham]
Stay the fuck out of my flat.

01:05:17.486 --> 01:05:19.421
How did you know I was
going to be here anyway?

01:05:20.256 --> 01:05:22.025
[Graham] You posted it on
Twitter, you fuckwit.

01:05:23.059 --> 01:05:24.559
All right, fair point.

01:05:26.628 --> 01:05:28.231
Did you get all that?

01:05:28.264 --> 01:05:29.765
Get some B roll,
the wheat field.

01:05:29.798 --> 01:05:32.768
[creepy music]

01:05:45.981 --> 01:05:47.516
[clears throat]

01:05:50.019 --> 01:05:55.224
Back in the 70s, an artist put
on a revolutionary exhibit.

01:05:55.258 --> 01:05:57.893
You know, it's one that's
always stuck with me.

01:05:57.926 --> 01:05:59.962
<i>The artist stood
in the middle of the room,</i>

01:05:59.995 --> 01:06:02.497
<i>and she was completely still.</i>

01:06:02.531 --> 01:06:05.867
And she surrounded herself
with dozens of objects.

01:06:05.901 --> 01:06:10.706
<i>A feather, a rose,
some bread, grapes,</i>

01:06:10.739 --> 01:06:13.309
<i>scissors, a scalpel,</i>

01:06:13.343 --> 01:06:15.544
<i>a gun loaded with one bullet.</i>

01:06:16.778 --> 01:06:18.281
Well, the point
of the piece was to

01:06:18.314 --> 01:06:21.683
allow people to act
how they wanted to interact.

01:06:21.717 --> 01:06:25.254
She didn't intervene,
they had carte blanche.

01:06:26.822 --> 01:06:28.291
She rendered herself powerless.

01:06:29.225 --> 01:06:31.660
And at first it was fine.

01:06:31.693 --> 01:06:34.763
You know, people found
it amusing and fun.

01:06:34.796 --> 01:06:40.003
<i>You know, some played with the
perfume, played with the feather,</i>

01:06:40.036 --> 01:06:41.737
<i>and some even gave her a kiss.</i>

01:06:42.637 --> 01:06:44.573
But then things turned sour.

01:06:46.209 --> 01:06:48.344
[people yelling]

01:06:48.378 --> 01:06:50.712
[cocks gun]

01:06:50.746 --> 01:06:53.049
Eventually, some of the audience

01:06:53.082 --> 01:06:55.584
intervened and saved her life.

01:06:55.617 --> 01:06:59.188
Afterwards she said what
she'd learned was that

01:06:59.222 --> 01:07:01.357
when you leave it
up to the public,

01:07:01.391 --> 01:07:03.359
well, they can kill you.

01:07:03.393 --> 01:07:06.828
And, this is
the kind of social contract

01:07:06.862 --> 01:07:09.365
we take out when
we put ourselves online.

01:07:09.399 --> 01:07:13.136
You know, we open
ourselves up for abuse.

01:07:13.169 --> 01:07:14.037
And...

01:07:15.271 --> 01:07:18.341
In a sense, we're allowing
perfect strangers

01:07:18.374 --> 01:07:21.077
access to our most
intimate moments.

01:07:21.110 --> 01:07:25.214
And when people
are allowed anonymity,

01:07:25.248 --> 01:07:28.984
and permission, well, you don't
know how far they'll take it.

01:07:37.726 --> 01:07:39.062
I don't know what to do.

01:07:41.663 --> 01:07:43.066
I took the keys from Steve.

01:07:44.699 --> 01:07:46.169
But it's not changed anything.

01:07:51.374 --> 01:07:52.741
[sniffs]

01:07:55.710 --> 01:07:57.313
I just need
a little bit of help.

01:07:59.748 --> 01:08:00.982
I just need help.

01:08:02.085 --> 01:08:03.618
[doorbell rings]

01:08:10.093 --> 01:08:11.993
- [doorbell rings]
- [sniffs]

01:08:16.332 --> 01:08:17.366
[sniffs]

01:08:19.167 --> 01:08:20.336
[sighs]

01:08:23.339 --> 01:08:25.073
[knocking]

01:08:27.676 --> 01:08:29.078
[door opens]

01:08:30.179 --> 01:08:31.947
[Erin]
Graham, hello.

01:08:32.881 --> 01:08:34.183
Oh, my God, are you okay?

01:08:36.917 --> 01:08:38.121
[door closes]

01:08:47.029 --> 01:08:48.397
What is this?

01:08:48.430 --> 01:08:49.365
Feedback.

01:08:51.134 --> 01:08:52.100
What are you filming?

01:08:53.835 --> 01:08:57.140
Just, you know,
[clears throat] more evidence.

01:08:58.374 --> 01:08:59.408
[chuckles]

01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:01.977
What are you talking about?

01:09:03.246 --> 01:09:05.747
You know, the haunting
that's been going on

01:09:05.779 --> 01:09:07.216
in this flat for months now?

01:09:08.184 --> 01:09:10.019
That no one believes me about?

01:09:10.051 --> 01:09:11.420
Okay.

01:09:11.453 --> 01:09:13.456
Well, I'm a little
worried about you.

01:09:13.488 --> 01:09:15.091
Come on, let's just
turn off the camera.

01:09:15.124 --> 01:09:16.125
No, no, no.

01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:20.296
[sighs]

01:09:22.796 --> 01:09:24.066
Graham, this isn't real.

01:09:25.767 --> 01:09:26.935
We faked this.

01:09:28.437 --> 01:09:31.939
So, why don't you just
come back to mine,

01:09:31.973 --> 01:09:35.810
relax, take it easy, yeah?

01:09:37.313 --> 01:09:38.712
It was real.

01:09:38.747 --> 01:09:39.848
It is real.

01:09:41.117 --> 01:09:42.484
Graham, it wasn't real.

01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:46.688
It wasn't real, we, we faked it.

01:09:47.822 --> 01:09:49.858
Okay, and you need to come
back with me,

01:09:49.890 --> 01:09:52.528
and I need you to come
back with me, okay?

01:09:52.562 --> 01:09:55.198
The sounds that are
happening in this flat,

01:09:55.231 --> 01:09:57.333
the things that are moving
around on their own,

01:09:57.366 --> 01:09:59.302
they're real, they're real.

01:09:59.335 --> 01:10:00.869
Graham, you're scaring me.

01:10:03.239 --> 01:10:05.341
Look, they want me to...

01:10:05.374 --> 01:10:07.443
What do you want though?

01:10:08.578 --> 01:10:10.946
Tell me, what do you want, okay?

01:10:10.979 --> 01:10:14.283
Is this important to you,
is this not important to you?

01:10:14.317 --> 01:10:16.718
Am I important to you?

01:10:19.589 --> 01:10:22.158
God, come on, answer me,
what do you want?

01:10:23.292 --> 01:10:24.327
I want you to leave.

01:10:32.568 --> 01:10:33.735
Wait.

01:10:43.145 --> 01:10:44.046
Sorry.

01:10:45.348 --> 01:10:47.550
It's fine, just. [sighs]

01:10:47.583 --> 01:10:50.286
I'm worried about you, okay?

01:10:50.319 --> 01:10:52.321
I just need one more night,

01:10:52.355 --> 01:10:53.389
one more night.

01:10:54.956 --> 01:10:56.058
And then I'll, I'll come back.

01:10:57.460 --> 01:11:00.329
And we'll forget about all this,
just one, one more night.

01:11:06.502 --> 01:11:08.037
[sighs] Okay.

01:11:17.513 --> 01:11:19.548
So, it's come to this.

01:11:20.616 --> 01:11:21.883
The last night in the flat.

01:11:23.619 --> 01:11:26.921
I mean, fuck it,
I'm just renting anyway.

01:11:26.955 --> 01:11:30.459
[clock ticking]

01:11:30.493 --> 01:11:33.962
I don't know what use there
is staying one more night.

01:11:34.996 --> 01:11:37.866
I don't know what I could
possibly catch on camera that

01:11:37.899 --> 01:11:39.468
would convince you
that hasn't already.

01:11:41.037 --> 01:11:41.771
But...

01:11:43.272 --> 01:11:45.174
I just feel like
I have to do this.

01:11:57.420 --> 01:11:59.221
It's two a.m.

01:11:59.255 --> 01:12:02.191
Nothing to report other than
the usual bumps and whispers.

01:12:02.224 --> 01:12:03.992
[chuckles] Usual.

01:12:06.928 --> 01:12:08.963
It's weird that you
don't really hear about

01:12:08.997 --> 01:12:11.467
stuff happening in places
like this, new builds.

01:12:14.704 --> 01:12:18.973
Maybe it's built on an ancient
Glaswegian burial ground,

01:12:19.008 --> 01:12:21.010
and they're trying
to communicate with us.

01:12:23.479 --> 01:12:24.613
Ouija board. [chuckles]

01:12:38.361 --> 01:12:40.229
So, it's three a.m.

01:12:42.498 --> 01:12:44.033
I don't know what
I'm still doing here.

01:12:46.569 --> 01:12:47.869
I think Erin was right.

01:12:49.472 --> 01:12:50.673
So I'm going to pack up.

01:12:52.575 --> 01:12:53.542
And that's...

01:12:56.045 --> 01:12:59.081
[whispering]

01:13:05.987 --> 01:13:08.257
[screeching]

01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:16.265
Okay, fuck this.

01:13:18.267 --> 01:13:19.301
[door slams]

01:13:27.676 --> 01:13:28.943
What...

01:13:30.246 --> 01:13:31.480
the fuck?

01:13:31.514 --> 01:13:34.550
[clock ticking faster]

01:14:00.009 --> 01:14:02.278
[growling]

01:14:46.822 --> 01:14:48.224
[scratching]

01:14:51.494 --> 01:14:53.395
What the fuck?

01:15:00.269 --> 01:15:01.470
[scratching]

01:15:05.574 --> 01:15:06.642
Come on.

01:15:14.850 --> 01:15:17.386
[whispering]

01:15:22.224 --> 01:15:23.559
[scratching]

01:15:25.361 --> 01:15:28.397
[Graham laughs]

01:15:41.176 --> 01:15:44.179
- [growling]
- [banging]

01:15:50.686 --> 01:15:53.722
[harp music]

01:15:55.591 --> 01:15:59.361
Concussion, broken wrist,

01:15:59.395 --> 01:16:00.763
three fractured ribs...

01:16:01.864 --> 01:16:03.365
dislocated shoulder.

01:16:04.667 --> 01:16:08.704
<i>He survived, but it was
touch and go for a fair bit.</i>

01:16:08.737 --> 01:16:11.874
I was in visiting him
in hospital every day.

01:16:14.743 --> 01:16:16.312
<i>It was a struggle.</i>

01:16:16.345 --> 01:16:17.813
<i>He clearly wasn't himself.</i>

01:16:17.846 --> 01:16:20.115
<i>Not like he was
when we were kids.</i>

01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:23.452
[calm music]

01:16:25.154 --> 01:16:27.189
<i>It was my idea for him
to check into care.</i>

01:16:27.222 --> 01:16:31.126
<i>And the doctors did a lot of
tests and things and decided</i>

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:34.196
<i>it was best for him to have
a bit of time to recover.</i>

01:16:34.229 --> 01:16:37.399
<i>Think it was best for him not
to be in the flat any more.</i>

01:16:37.433 --> 01:16:40.302
<i>Doesn't matter about
all the ghost shit.</i>

01:16:40.336 --> 01:16:43.706
<i>If it's real, if it's not,
it's irrelevant.</i>

01:16:43.739 --> 01:16:45.341
<i>He got put through the ringer.</i>

01:16:45.374 --> 01:16:47.509
<i>Did he bring a lot
of that on himself?</i>

01:16:47.543 --> 01:16:48.444
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:16:49.378 --> 01:16:50.779
<i>But in my opinion,</i>

01:16:50.813 --> 01:16:52.281
<i>the punishment
didn't fit the crime.</i>

01:16:55.217 --> 01:16:57.553
I mean, it's funny, like,

01:16:57.586 --> 01:16:58.954
after he almost died,
people seemed

01:16:58.988 --> 01:17:01.223
less willing to criticize him.

01:17:02.424 --> 01:17:05.861
The whole thing just
quietly blew over.

01:17:09.531 --> 01:17:11.333
I still see him once a week.

01:17:11.367 --> 01:17:12.534
He seems happier.

01:17:13.636 --> 01:17:16.639
And I have not been back
to the flat since. [chuckles]

01:17:16.672 --> 01:17:19.475
Um, he's not had
any internet access.

01:17:20.542 --> 01:17:24.446
And I think he's really trying
to kick this addiction.

01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:25.581
Cold turkey.

01:17:25.614 --> 01:17:26.815
So as far as I'm aware,

01:17:26.849 --> 01:17:28.283
if he's seen anything,

01:17:29.218 --> 01:17:30.686
he's not told me about it, so.

01:17:32.554 --> 01:17:36.825
I kept asking him if I could
write a follow up biography.

01:17:36.859 --> 01:17:38.727
People would read that.

01:17:38.761 --> 01:17:41.764
Um, but he stopped replying
to my messages,

01:17:41.797 --> 01:17:44.566
and ultimately
refused to see me.

01:17:45.467 --> 01:17:47.202
What can I do? Fuck him.

01:17:48.237 --> 01:17:50.006
No, I don't see him
anymore, I mean,

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:53.409
he seems healthy now,
why would I interrupt that?

01:17:53.442 --> 01:17:55.678
Plus I've got a lot
of things going on, you know,

01:17:55.711 --> 01:17:58.313
uh, did I tell you about
my new YouTube series?

01:17:59.415 --> 01:18:01.784
No, oh, right, okay,
so, well, it's called...

01:18:01.817 --> 01:18:05.721
It's about as happy
an ending as we can hope for.

01:18:05.754 --> 01:18:08.691
Graham's, like, mentally
the best he's ever been.

01:18:10.026 --> 01:18:11.226
And in the end...

01:18:12.628 --> 01:18:14.263
isn't that all we can ask for?

01:18:15.864 --> 01:18:18.400
To be comfortable
in our own skin.

01:18:18.434 --> 01:18:24.573
It's not care about likes
or views or whatever the fuck.

01:18:26.542 --> 01:18:28.277
How important are views anyway?

01:18:32.715 --> 01:18:34.216
[chuckles]

01:18:39.055 --> 01:18:41.657
[Alice]
<i>But the views are important.</i>

01:18:41.690 --> 01:18:44.626
[suspenseful music]

01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:47.796
I wasn't keen on
this whole neat conclusion.

01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:51.400
Um, Graham has
a near death experience,

01:18:51.433 --> 01:18:56.438
goes into care, gets well again,
finds public love again.

01:18:56.472 --> 01:18:59.942
Um, good for him,
but I didn't buy it.

01:18:59.975 --> 01:19:02.544
I hate loose threads,
and it felt like

01:19:02.578 --> 01:19:05.614
there were tons of
loose threads left over.

01:19:05.647 --> 01:19:07.950
So, I did some digging.

01:19:08.951 --> 01:19:12.287
What I found was
Graham's YouTube channel.

01:19:12.321 --> 01:19:13.722
It was still live.

01:19:13.756 --> 01:19:15.624
And this was
when he was in care,

01:19:15.657 --> 01:19:17.659
and had no access
to the internet.

01:19:18.927 --> 01:19:21.363
Seems a little
insensitive to me.

01:19:21.396 --> 01:19:24.900
<i>Something stood out when
I was looking at his channel.</i>

01:19:24.933 --> 01:19:27.736
<i>I checked the about page,
and the email address</i>

01:19:27.770 --> 01:19:30.073
<i>for business inquiries
looked familiar.</i>

01:19:30.106 --> 01:19:33.275
<i>"padthemouse," I'd seen
that somewhere before.</i>

01:19:34.843 --> 01:19:37.913
<i>It was the same as
Steve's business address.</i>

01:19:39.915 --> 01:19:42.317
Well here's where
it gets interesting.

01:19:42.351 --> 01:19:44.987
Erin claimed to have
no media presence really,

01:19:45.021 --> 01:19:47.090
she wasn't on any social
media accounts

01:19:47.123 --> 01:19:48.657
or anything like that.

01:19:48.690 --> 01:19:51.094
But, she did have
an Etsy account.

01:19:51.127 --> 01:19:54.363
Selling her "art."

01:19:54.396 --> 01:19:57.499
<i>And when you go to contact
the store owner,</i>

01:19:57.533 --> 01:19:59.701
<i>guess who? "padthemouse."</i>

01:20:01.937 --> 01:20:03.939
- Just chill.
- Yeah, but if they fucking find out

01:20:03.972 --> 01:20:06.909
we've been faking it, then we're
going to be in so much shit.

01:20:06.942 --> 01:20:10.612
[Alice] <i>So I find it odd that
through all of that tension...</i>

01:20:10.646 --> 01:20:12.115
Help me out.

01:20:12.148 --> 01:20:13.715
- [Alice] <i>...animosity.</i>
- [punch]

01:20:13.749 --> 01:20:15.551
- You're losing it, man.
- Just fucking leave.

01:20:15.584 --> 01:20:17.020
[Alice]
<i>Through all of that,</i>

01:20:17.053 --> 01:20:18.954
<i>they shared
a business email address?</i>

01:20:18.987 --> 01:20:22.025
<i>Did he not once try
to split their businesses?</i>

01:20:23.792 --> 01:20:25.594
<i>But the really strange thing...</i>

01:20:26.762 --> 01:20:29.932
These channels and shops,
they were all set up

01:20:29.965 --> 01:20:32.101
<i>before Graham and Erin allegedly</i>

01:20:32.135 --> 01:20:33.669
<i>started collaborating
with Steve.</i>

01:20:34.603 --> 01:20:36.172
<i>Before they even met him.</i>

01:20:36.206 --> 01:20:39.708
It makes me think
that everything,

01:20:39.741 --> 01:20:41.577
including the internet downfall,

01:20:41.610 --> 01:20:43.946
all of it had been orchestrated

01:20:43.979 --> 01:20:46.381
and faked,
more than anyone realized.

01:20:47.850 --> 01:20:49.185
Well, I like where
your head's at,

01:20:49.219 --> 01:20:51.854
and it's good to meet
you and Erin.

01:20:51.887 --> 01:20:53.089
[Erin]
Hey.

01:20:53.122 --> 01:20:54.423
[Alice]
<i>If you look closely,</i>

01:20:54.456 --> 01:20:55.891
<i>the clues are there.</i>

01:20:55.924 --> 01:20:58.061
<i>Graham, Erin, and Steve
had met each other</i>

01:20:58.094 --> 01:21:00.629
<i>before their first
alleged meeting.</i>

01:21:00.662 --> 01:21:02.031
Aye, it'll cost you extra.

01:21:02.065 --> 01:21:03.398
Target's holding, move, move.

01:21:03.432 --> 01:21:04.167
F###!

01:21:05.934 --> 01:21:07.669
[Alice]
<i>They'd made sketches before.</i>

01:21:16.212 --> 01:21:19.048
<i>There's the shirt on
the radiator in Graham's flat.</i>

01:21:22.851 --> 01:21:24.187
<i>This was a month
before they claim</i>

01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:25.754
<i>to have met for the first time.</i>

01:21:27.522 --> 01:21:28.924
It's fine.

01:21:28.957 --> 01:21:31.526
I just need one more night,
one more night.

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:33.196
[Alice] <i>Erin left that
night, didn't she?</i>

01:21:34.596 --> 01:21:37.233
<i>If that's the case, then what
was she doing back later,</i>

01:21:37.267 --> 01:21:38.734
<i>bursting out of the wall?</i>

01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:47.476
<i>The deeper you look,
the more the evidence piles up.</i>

01:21:47.509 --> 01:21:49.112
Haven't seen Erin in a few days.

01:21:49.145 --> 01:21:50.812
[Alice] <i>If you haven't
seen Erin in days,</i>

01:21:50.846 --> 01:21:52.514
<i>then what's she doing
in your flat?</i>

01:22:01.957 --> 01:22:04.826
Look, the evidence is there.

01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:06.662
It may seem
more implausible to you,

01:22:06.695 --> 01:22:09.032
but there are only two options.

01:22:09.065 --> 01:22:13.535
Either this is
one of the most well documented,

01:22:13.568 --> 01:22:17.106
incredible cases
of a real haunting ever...

01:22:18.507 --> 01:22:20.009
or it's an elaborate prank.

01:22:21.044 --> 01:22:23.246
I guarantee you,
in a few months,

01:22:23.279 --> 01:22:25.181
once everyone's forgotten
this story,

01:22:25.214 --> 01:22:27.749
Graham's quietly going
to leave care,

01:22:27.783 --> 01:22:30.119
rejoin society,
and he's going to have

01:22:30.153 --> 01:22:31.753
a ton of cash in the bank.

01:22:32.654 --> 01:22:34.290
I can't force you to believe me.

01:22:34.324 --> 01:22:37.693
Unfortunately, evidence isn't
enough for people any more.

01:22:40.330 --> 01:22:41.730
[interviewer]
Have you heard the allegations

01:22:41.763 --> 01:22:43.999
that Alice has been
making about you?

01:22:44.033 --> 01:22:45.500
Which ones?

01:22:45.534 --> 01:22:46.868
That this whole thing
has been faked,

01:22:46.902 --> 01:22:48.071
and that you
were working alongside

01:22:48.104 --> 01:22:49.738
Erin and Graham this whole time.

01:22:51.074 --> 01:22:52.641
Oh, yeah, that one's a good one.

01:22:52.674 --> 01:22:56.912
Um, okay, so listen,
I cut ties with Graham,

01:22:56.945 --> 01:22:59.581
as soon as I gave him
the flat keys back, that was us.

01:23:00.615 --> 01:23:02.185
What about the evidence
she's brought forward?

01:23:04.586 --> 01:23:09.958
Well, can you believe
everything you see on camera?

01:23:09.992 --> 01:23:10.892
No.

01:23:12.061 --> 01:23:13.929
Like, seeing is believing,

01:23:13.962 --> 01:23:15.764
that just doesn't apply
any more.

01:23:16.865 --> 01:23:17.833
Does it?

01:23:17.866 --> 01:23:19.202
This could be faked.

01:23:19.235 --> 01:23:20.169
You could be fake.

01:23:21.237 --> 01:23:23.172
Who's to say what's real,
what's not?

01:23:28.077 --> 01:23:29.345
[interviewer]
So what do you make

01:23:29.379 --> 01:23:31.247
of the allegations
that you and Steve

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:33.615
and Graham conspired
to fake this whole thing?

01:23:34.384 --> 01:23:35.318
Well...

01:23:36.752 --> 01:23:39.255
We actually spoke, Alice and I,

01:23:39.288 --> 01:23:40.655
and she showed me her evidence,

01:23:40.689 --> 01:23:42.924
and as far as I'm concerned,

01:23:42.958 --> 01:23:44.327
she has no evidence.

01:23:46.895 --> 01:23:49.564
I don't know, I don't know
what to believe any more.

01:23:49.598 --> 01:23:53.535
All I know is what I did
and what I didn't do, and...

01:23:54.669 --> 01:23:56.305
I guess I have
to take comfort in that.

01:23:56.339 --> 01:23:58.573
Some people say all sorts
of things about me,

01:23:58.607 --> 01:24:01.010
but I know what's true,
and I know what's not true,

01:24:01.044 --> 01:24:03.779
as well, and life goes on.

01:24:05.747 --> 01:24:06.915
As does the afterlife.

01:24:08.117 --> 01:24:10.819
If you believe that
sort of thing, so.

01:24:12.854 --> 01:24:14.090

01:24:48.757 --> 01:24:50.426

01:24:54.163 --> 01:24:55.064
I'm back.

01:24:58.967 --> 01:25:00.635
I've had a lot of time to think.

01:25:04.474 --> 01:25:08.311
And I've been back online, and

01:25:08.344 --> 01:25:11.414
looking at everything
that's been posted.

01:25:13.116 --> 01:25:14.983
Everything that's
been said about me.

01:25:15.017 --> 01:25:16.885
About the things that's
happened in this flat.

01:25:22.691 --> 01:25:25.361
And I've had some time
to think about

01:25:25.394 --> 01:25:27.996
what's really important to me.

01:25:32.168 --> 01:25:33.069
And...

01:25:34.036 --> 01:25:37.039
I know that there's
only one thing I can do.

01:25:38.274 --> 01:25:40.343
To, to prove...

01:25:42.111 --> 01:25:43.812
that this whole
thing has been real...

01:25:46.115 --> 01:25:47.716
and that I meant
every single word of it.
