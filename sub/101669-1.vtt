WEBVTT

01:19.667 --> 01:25.663
"Attorney visitation"

01:27.417 --> 01:29.123
good morning, vice president!

01:32.625 --> 01:33.660
You're alone today?

01:33.750 --> 01:36.662
Yes, attorney suh is
prepping for the hearing.

01:36.833 --> 01:39.199
If you have a message, I'll relay it.

01:39.292 --> 01:41.999
No, it's fine, I'm sure
you all will do fine.

01:42.333 --> 01:43.448
Go on, sit.

01:43.833 --> 01:44.833
Yes, sir.

01:48.250 --> 01:51.242
I brought newspaper clippings,
would you like to see them?

02:03.583 --> 02:05.393
"Charged with stock manipulation
and embezzlement,"

02:05.417 --> 02:08.079
"who is min cheol-hyun?"

02:44.625 --> 02:45.455
Yeah, sis.

02:45.542 --> 02:46.952
Did you see my text?

02:47.167 --> 02:48.031
Yeah.

02:48.125 --> 02:50.616
What should I do? Shouldn't I sue?

02:50.708 --> 02:52.664
Sue for what? It was no big deal.

02:52.750 --> 02:55.617
Your nephew was attacked by bullies,
that's no big deal?

02:55.708 --> 02:57.539
So he's scratched up a bit,

02:57.625 --> 03:00.116
put some ointment on them,
kids can get rough.

03:00.208 --> 03:03.041
You have no clue how
scary kids nowadays are?

03:03.125 --> 03:05.537
Talk to the teacher, why
are you nagging me?

03:05.625 --> 03:08.412
You work for a top 3 law firms,

03:08.500 --> 03:09.865
why shouldn't I talk to you?!

03:09.958 --> 03:14.406
I'm a temp at jh law. Don't you know?

03:14.500 --> 03:18.197
I know, you're in charge
of rakwon's Sonny boy!

03:18.542 --> 03:21.249
Your firm won't leave that to just anyone!

03:22.042 --> 03:24.408
No, not to just anyone.

03:24.875 --> 03:27.036
These super rich boys get bored in jail

03:27.125 --> 03:28.581
so they got me run errands.

03:28.667 --> 03:31.124
Forget it! You're still a lawyer,

03:31.208 --> 03:34.575
call up the bullies' parents
and freak them out!

03:34.667 --> 03:36.203
I'm busy, I gotta go!

03:41.333 --> 03:45.656
Unjust and exploitative jh must apologize!

03:45.750 --> 03:47.832
Apologize! Apologize!

03:47.917 --> 03:52.160
Guardians of speculative capital!
Punish jh!

03:52.250 --> 03:54.491
Punish! Punish!

03:54.583 --> 03:56.790
Jh must apologize!

03:56.875 --> 03:58.911
Apologize! Apologize!

03:59.000 --> 04:03.289
Guardians of speculative capital!
Punish jh!

04:03.375 --> 04:05.411
- Good morning, Mr. hwang!
- Punish! Punish!

04:05.500 --> 04:09.539
Unjust and exploitative jh must apologize!

04:09.625 --> 04:11.786
Apologize! Apologize!

04:11.875 --> 04:15.823
Guardians of speculative capital!
Punish jh!

04:15.917 --> 04:17.952
Punish! Punish!

04:18.041 --> 04:20.749
Unjust and exploitative jh must apologize!

04:32.167 --> 04:35.864
This doesn't work all of sudden.
I work at jh.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.572
Temporary cards must be renewed,
didn't you know?

04:43.667 --> 04:47.205
I forgot about that. I'll renew it today.

04:47.292 --> 04:48.452
Sure.

04:49.042 --> 04:50.042
Good morning.

04:50.125 --> 04:51.911
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

04:57.333 --> 04:58.368
Good morning.

04:58.458 --> 05:00.101
- Good morning, Ms. suh!
- What brings you here?

05:00.125 --> 05:01.740
I went to see Mr. min earlier.

05:01.833 --> 05:03.164
He said to tell you...

05:03.250 --> 05:05.741
You can give the report to my secretary.

05:05.833 --> 05:08.950
Mr. min says... he's doing fine.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.657
Okay, good work.

05:10.917 --> 05:13.499
If you need anything else,
don't hesitate to tell me!

05:14.083 --> 05:16.199
This is 14th floor.

05:20.958 --> 05:22.198
Kang tae-soo.

05:22.750 --> 05:24.035
Hey song.

05:28.792 --> 05:30.373
Going down.

05:32.042 --> 05:33.248
Been well?

05:33.417 --> 05:34.907
Yeah, you know.

05:36.292 --> 05:39.204
Come to the reunion for once,
everyone's curious about you.

05:39.833 --> 05:42.996
I really should, but I can't find the time.

05:43.125 --> 05:46.617
We're meeting this Friday,
didn't you get the text?

05:46.750 --> 05:48.115
I got it.

05:48.708 --> 05:50.824
But I got an appointment on Friday.

05:52.458 --> 05:54.039
Don't be like that.

05:56.042 --> 05:57.703
I got an appointment.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.202
Kang tae-soo.

06:00.583 --> 06:03.370
No one from our class
will say anything bad about you,

06:03.458 --> 06:04.789
there's no need to be dejected.

06:04.875 --> 06:07.867
When did I feel dejected?
I'm just busy on Friday!

06:07.958 --> 06:10.165
Even sunlight will reach the rat hole.

06:10.375 --> 06:11.809
You gotta hit rock bottom
to jump back up...

06:11.833 --> 06:15.155
Jesus! I got an appointment,
I can't go because of it!

06:15.250 --> 06:16.581
8th floor

06:26.625 --> 06:27.976
Come have some coffee in my office.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.285
Forget it, I'm busy.

06:29.375 --> 06:31.957
Dude, I'm your friend.

06:32.625 --> 06:35.697
Only we became lawyers
from that third-rate school.

06:36.250 --> 06:39.913
You shouldn't treat me like this.

06:40.750 --> 06:43.947
You tend to lecture me whenever you see me,

06:44.458 --> 06:46.369
you're just dying to tell me

06:46.458 --> 06:49.530
that you're an associate at jh

06:49.625 --> 06:51.411
and I'm a bottom-dwelling temp,

06:51.500 --> 06:52.580
am I right?

06:52.667 --> 06:54.157
And I don't need friends,

06:54.250 --> 06:56.536
so don't order me around.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.865
Why're you like this?

07:02.625 --> 07:04.707
Dude, sunlight will reach the rat...

07:04.792 --> 07:07.454
Why are you keep using a rat metaphor?

07:07.667 --> 07:08.827
What a bad luck...

07:09.208 --> 07:12.621
Guardians of speculative capital!

07:12.708 --> 07:14.872
Good afternoon!

07:14.875 --> 07:17.662
Punish jh! Punish jh!

07:17.750 --> 07:19.331
Good afternoon, boss!

07:19.417 --> 07:22.284
Unjust and exploitative jh must apologize!

07:22.375 --> 07:24.866
Apologize! Apologize!

07:24.958 --> 07:28.871
Guardians of speculative capital!
Punish jh!

07:28.958 --> 07:30.619
Punish! Punish!

07:30.708 --> 07:33.290
That's hwang! Let's mobilize! This way!

07:33.375 --> 07:35.957
- Punish! Punish!
- Why are they bitching and moaning here?

07:36.042 --> 07:38.249
- Punish! Punish!
- What exactly do you do?!

07:38.333 --> 07:39.368
Sir, we should leave!

07:39.417 --> 07:40.684
Unjust and exploitative jh must apologize!

07:40.708 --> 07:42.744
Sue those bastards
for interfering with our work!

07:42.833 --> 07:44.915
The union sent them as backup!

07:45.000 --> 07:47.457
They want us to sue them and cause a stink.

07:47.542 --> 07:49.203
It's best to ignore them.

07:49.292 --> 07:52.455
Exploiter of speculative capital!
Punish jh!

07:52.625 --> 07:54.115
"Exploiter of speculative capital'?

07:54.417 --> 07:58.080
If it wasn't for it,
your colleagues would be out on the street,

07:58.167 --> 07:59.476
without a single cent of pension!

07:59.500 --> 08:00.580
What did you just say?!

08:12.000 --> 08:13.206
Mr. hwang!

08:15.458 --> 08:16.664
Sir!

08:16.958 --> 08:18.619
Are you okay?!

08:19.958 --> 08:21.789
Sir, you go ahead!

08:25.125 --> 08:26.160
Dammit...

08:26.250 --> 08:27.410
Drive!

08:30.208 --> 08:31.493
Come on, hurry!

08:42.000 --> 08:45.197
I feel bad that my brother
is public enemy âŞ1,

08:45.292 --> 08:47.032
and is rotting behind bars,

08:47.708 --> 08:52.577
but I believe rakwon
must use this chance to change.

08:52.708 --> 08:56.496
Those without the means
like to blame others,

08:56.792 --> 08:58.373
don't mind them, madame.

08:58.500 --> 09:03.073
70% of our business is done
with low and middle classes,

09:03.167 --> 09:07.080
but my father and brother
were never respected nor liked by them.

09:07.292 --> 09:08.748
I'm different.

09:09.375 --> 09:11.787
Why else come to a place like this,

09:12.333 --> 09:14.540
instead of our company restaurant?

09:16.792 --> 09:18.999
The entire restaurant has been booked.

09:20.458 --> 09:22.119
But the hall is empty.

09:23.292 --> 09:25.624
So dumb, let's go.

09:27.625 --> 09:29.365
Mr. hwang called for me.

09:30.333 --> 09:31.664
Mr. oh!

09:41.042 --> 09:42.498
So you're kang?

09:42.583 --> 09:43.789
Yes, Mr. hwang.

09:44.625 --> 09:48.288
Say hello, this is rakwon group's
vice president min chae-ryung.

09:48.375 --> 09:50.616
Nice to meet you, I'm kang tae-soo!

09:50.792 --> 09:53.454
He's assisting with your brother's case.

09:53.708 --> 09:54.914
Is that so?

09:55.500 --> 09:56.956
I've never seen him before.

09:58.167 --> 10:00.374
Not for the trial, but at jail...

10:03.042 --> 10:04.953
I better go now.

10:05.042 --> 10:06.042
Yes, ma'am.

10:11.750 --> 10:13.581
- Good bye.
- Thank you.

10:19.042 --> 10:20.282
Sit, sit.

10:21.125 --> 10:22.240
Yes, sir.

10:24.625 --> 10:25.990
Have you had lunch?

10:26.208 --> 10:27.744
I'm fine, sir.

10:27.958 --> 10:31.405
All right. So, how long have you
worked for our firm?

10:31.583 --> 10:32.914
8 months, sir.

10:33.625 --> 10:35.081
Almost a year.

10:37.375 --> 10:40.538
"I'd like to work for the m&a department,â

10:40.625 --> 10:42.035
this is your cv cover letter?

10:42.125 --> 10:44.616
Yes, sir, I've been
studying m&a laws extensively.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.663
There is something
I'd like to discuss with you.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.408
It's an m&a deal of sort.

10:52.875 --> 10:56.618
We have a client called
value fyre haus William & Gabriel,

10:56.708 --> 10:58.619
a uk-based equity fund,

10:58.875 --> 11:00.285
let's call them Gabriel.

11:00.375 --> 11:01.785
Right, Gabriel.

11:02.542 --> 11:05.284
They bought a Korean company recently.

11:08.917 --> 11:11.454
Dongsan park? It's a zoo?

11:12.417 --> 11:14.453
They defaulted on their loan.

11:14.542 --> 11:17.659
The creditors assumed the loan,
and Gabriel took it over

11:17.792 --> 11:22.035
for 1 cent with the condition
of extending the loan deadline.

11:23.042 --> 11:25.408
We'll be managing it for a while.

11:25.542 --> 11:26.952
What do you mean by that?

11:27.500 --> 11:29.616
They gave us full managerial authority.

11:30.625 --> 11:33.458
It doesn't look good for a private equity

11:33.542 --> 11:37.080
valued at several billions to dive into
this to make mere $10 million.

11:37.167 --> 11:38.623
Making $10 million with 1 cent?

11:38.750 --> 11:42.163
Do some restructuring
and when people start coming in,

11:42.292 --> 11:44.704
we add business rights and sell it back.

11:46.167 --> 11:48.328
How about it? Quite challenging, huh?

11:48.792 --> 11:50.202
Yes, it's brilliant.

11:50.458 --> 11:53.825
I'd like you to handle this brilliant plan.

11:54.167 --> 11:55.247
Pardon?

11:56.958 --> 12:00.951
How many people on earth
would ever become a zoo director?

12:02.208 --> 12:03.869
Me? A zoo director?

12:03.958 --> 12:06.165
Take care of the zoo and come right back.

12:06.625 --> 12:08.866
I'll save you a spot in the m&a department.

12:10.917 --> 12:12.032
If you're not up for it...

12:12.125 --> 12:13.956
I'll do it! I'll give it my very best!

12:14.417 --> 12:15.827
3 months would do.

12:15.917 --> 12:18.374
Normalize the zoo in 3
months and maintain it,

12:18.500 --> 12:20.456
and I'll find a buyer in that time.

12:20.542 --> 12:24.706
Not a problem! I'll normalize
the zoo in 3 months!

12:26.583 --> 12:29.905
Your inauguration gift,
you're a zoo director now,

12:30.000 --> 12:32.867
you can't be seen in a cheap car.

12:48.583 --> 12:51.950
"Dongsan park entrance"

13:16.833 --> 13:20.781
"Dongsan park zoo"

13:58.083 --> 14:00.165
Are they all inside?

14:43.167 --> 14:45.783
Excuse me?! Where did all the animals go?!

14:46.333 --> 14:48.745
Excuse me! Wait!

14:48.833 --> 14:49.913
"Gorilla forest"

14:50.000 --> 14:51.490
it's okay, black nose!

14:51.667 --> 14:53.147
No one will take you away! It's okay!

14:53.208 --> 14:54.789
Why did they try to force him out?!

14:54.875 --> 14:57.662
- Dr. han, you're too close!
- Black nose, it's all right now!

14:57.750 --> 14:58.535
Here, shoot it!

14:58.625 --> 15:00.081
- Wait!
- Tranquilize him!

15:00.167 --> 15:01.247
Hold on a sec!

15:02.208 --> 15:04.870
Black nose! Stop it!

15:04.958 --> 15:06.289
He'll knock down the wall!

15:06.375 --> 15:08.866
No one'll take you away, it's all over.

15:09.083 --> 15:10.243
Good.

15:12.750 --> 15:13.750
Very good.

15:14.500 --> 15:17.822
Good boy, that's it.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.623
It's all right, okay.

15:20.375 --> 15:21.535
Excuse me?

15:23.792 --> 15:27.364
You took it all, what else do you want?

15:27.708 --> 15:32.247
I'm the new zoo director, kang tae-soo.

15:35.833 --> 15:37.698
It's completely empty.

15:48.542 --> 15:50.624
I heard a foreign company bought the zoo,

15:50.708 --> 15:52.118
aren't you a Korean?

15:52.208 --> 15:56.702
It's a uk-based private equity called
value fyre haus William & Gabriel...

15:57.042 --> 15:58.248
It's complicated.

15:58.333 --> 16:02.827
Jh law is taking charge of it
and they assigned me as the proxy.

16:03.917 --> 16:04.827
A stand-in.

16:04.917 --> 16:05.917
I'm not!

16:07.333 --> 16:08.789
I'm a professional manager.

16:14.583 --> 16:15.698
Ceo!

16:17.042 --> 16:21.285
I've been given full authority by
value fyre haus William & Gabriel.

16:21.542 --> 16:23.703
I'm the legal director of this zoo,

16:23.792 --> 16:27.614
who holds the key to your survival, got it?

16:31.667 --> 16:33.203
Okay, let me get this right.

16:33.958 --> 16:37.280
Because of the debt,
they took animals that's worth anything?

16:38.417 --> 16:40.123
So what's left?

16:41.875 --> 16:46.494
Meerkat, raccoon,
ostrich, parrot, black nose...

16:46.583 --> 16:47.698
Okay, that's enough.

16:49.417 --> 16:51.749
Who'd come to the zoo to
look at those animals?

16:54.375 --> 16:56.832
I better go...

16:56.917 --> 16:58.282
Director!

16:58.542 --> 16:59.327
'Director'?

16:59.417 --> 17:01.157
He's our zoo director.

17:01.375 --> 17:07.496
He founded dongsan park
and managed it till now...

17:09.333 --> 17:10.993
Now that a new director is here,

17:11.166 --> 17:15.240
the used up one better leave...

17:15.333 --> 17:18.405
Sit down for a second,
let me try to figure this out.

17:19.500 --> 17:22.492
Where are rest of the staff?

17:24.375 --> 17:30.655
Thanks to my incompetency,
I couldn't pay them and they all left.

17:31.917 --> 17:36.536
Thank you for sticking around till the end.

17:37.167 --> 17:38.828
I'll come with you, director.

17:39.500 --> 17:40.990
Hye-kyung, you're quitting too?

17:41.125 --> 17:42.706
Wait a minute!

17:43.542 --> 17:45.828
I think there's been some misunderstanding,

17:45.917 --> 17:47.999
I didn't come here to fire you.

17:48.083 --> 17:50.369
I'm here to save the zoo!

17:50.875 --> 17:53.116
I'll normalize the zoo at once!

17:53.583 --> 17:54.698
Easy for you to say.

18:03.042 --> 18:05.658
To do that, we need your help.

18:05.833 --> 18:09.371
With your experience and my passion,

18:09.792 --> 18:12.408
we can revitalize dongsan park.

18:12.833 --> 18:18.248
What's your plan? It's
a zoo without animals.

18:18.333 --> 18:19.948
Then we'll buy new ones!

18:20.750 --> 18:23.662
How much? How much do we need?

18:27.292 --> 18:29.658
Why the heck can't we buy animals?

18:30.333 --> 18:33.951
Never heard of international sales
agreement of endangered animals'?

18:34.042 --> 18:35.623
Aren't you a lawyer?

18:36.250 --> 18:40.573
Lions, tigers, elephants
are endangered, so they can't be exported.

18:40.667 --> 18:42.874
What about those animals in other zoos?

18:43.000 --> 18:46.948
They received special permission
for research or breeding.

18:47.042 --> 18:50.330
So why can't we get
breeding permission too?

18:51.042 --> 18:55.911
It'll take over 3 months for application
with department of environment,

18:56.542 --> 19:01.536
and finding a seller before we get a tiger.

19:01.625 --> 19:03.616
3 months? That's idiotic!

19:05.250 --> 19:09.243
Even human organs can be trafficked!

19:09.375 --> 19:14.415
There has to be a black market
for the zoos to make trades.

19:15.542 --> 19:17.078
I'm heading out.

19:17.917 --> 19:19.157
Wait, doctor,

19:19.917 --> 19:22.283
we have to discuss this together.

19:22.583 --> 19:26.405
I was gonna check ebay for used tigers.

19:33.958 --> 19:37.530
How do you type so fast
on such a tiny screen?

19:38.250 --> 19:41.538
Maybe my fingers are too fat,

19:41.625 --> 19:43.581
I can't really do that.

19:43.667 --> 19:45.999
Get a girlfriend, you'll learn fast.

19:46.375 --> 19:50.118
Don't pull my leg. I'm
not into that anymore.

19:50.833 --> 19:52.369
You got high standards?

19:52.500 --> 19:54.832
No, super low, actually.

19:55.042 --> 19:59.411
I don't care about looks at all.

19:59.833 --> 20:03.496
I'll find a decent girl, and get married.

20:04.917 --> 20:07.249
Oh! You're right!

20:07.500 --> 20:10.867
Before I get a girl, I
should practice texting.

20:11.083 --> 20:13.699
I'll need a good texting
partner, let's see.

20:13.958 --> 20:16.540
Who's a good texter around me?

20:18.083 --> 20:19.664
I have to!

20:20.750 --> 20:22.741
Save dongsan park!

20:23.583 --> 20:25.198
It's a once in a lifetime opportunity.

20:25.292 --> 20:27.499
I can't give up! I won't!

20:30.167 --> 20:33.659
I'm gonna save the zoo
like it's no one's business.

20:34.292 --> 20:38.535
Hooray to our new director!
Hooray to dongsan park!

20:41.000 --> 20:42.206
Baby!

20:42.667 --> 20:46.364
Look at the time, I told
you I'm busy today.

20:47.042 --> 20:50.205
Sorry, we had dinner with the new director.

20:51.083 --> 20:54.155
How did it go? Is the zoo salvageable?

20:54.250 --> 20:56.411
He said he'll try his best.

20:57.500 --> 21:01.618
With the zoo in shambles,
this shop's gone to hell.

21:01.833 --> 21:05.576
This is my entire fortune,
I'll probably go under...

21:05.708 --> 21:07.369
It'll work out.

21:10.708 --> 21:13.666
You invested $30,000 too,
at least look like an owner.

21:14.083 --> 21:17.780
Invested? You asked me for a loan.

21:17.917 --> 21:19.498
Don't talk like that.

21:19.958 --> 21:22.495
I'm not doing this for my benefit alone.

21:24.292 --> 21:27.614
And don't ever quit that zoo job.

21:27.958 --> 21:29.323
I won't.

21:29.542 --> 21:34.991
Anyway, man the shop properly,
clean it too and don't fool around.

21:37.208 --> 21:38.618
Just gonna leave?

21:39.542 --> 21:40.748
What?

21:49.667 --> 21:51.407
- Love you.
- Later!

21:55.750 --> 21:58.241
Wait, hold on there.

22:00.458 --> 22:06.328
Over there, that's director's quarters.

22:07.167 --> 22:09.829
Over here is staff quarters,

22:10.250 --> 22:15.074
since I ruined the zoo,
I gotta go this way!

22:15.208 --> 22:20.783
You should go that way!

22:23.417 --> 22:25.282
Let's go to the director's quarters.

22:25.375 --> 22:29.414
No, I'll sleep in the staff quarters.

22:30.042 --> 22:33.034
The boiler isn't fixed yet though.

22:38.125 --> 22:40.161
You can stay with me tonight.

22:42.708 --> 22:44.539
I don't deserve it...

22:45.000 --> 22:48.322
I ran this zoo to the ground...

23:00.250 --> 23:02.582
Tiger! A tiger escaped!

23:04.417 --> 23:05.998
There! It's over there!

23:07.750 --> 23:09.081
Let go of me.

23:09.417 --> 23:11.874
Don't go, director!

23:12.917 --> 23:14.248
Don't go!

23:15.958 --> 23:17.164
Director!

23:19.708 --> 23:21.744
- Mr. ha?
- Yes?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.490
What are you doing here?

23:26.375 --> 23:27.911
Good evening, sir.

23:28.625 --> 23:31.116
I was picking up my stuff from the office.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.536
So this is...

23:33.958 --> 23:37.826
There's a big restaurant in the city,
and they kept asking me for it.

23:38.458 --> 23:39.573
It's a stuffed tiger?

23:40.167 --> 23:41.202
Yes.

23:44.208 --> 23:45.573
Take it.

23:46.833 --> 23:51.247
We went under, take what you can sell.

23:51.417 --> 23:53.157
I'm sorry, sir.

23:56.917 --> 23:59.454
Why should you be sorry?

24:02.083 --> 24:03.493
Take it...

24:11.250 --> 24:13.707
He looks okay to me, what do you think?

24:13.792 --> 24:15.077
Indeed.

24:15.167 --> 24:18.614
When he was here, his
hind leg looked awkward.

24:18.750 --> 24:20.206
Take a look.

24:22.958 --> 24:24.448
Nothing's wrong.

24:24.667 --> 24:27.033
Yeah, I guess so...

24:27.917 --> 24:30.533
Could I take a look at 2 wolves too?

24:30.708 --> 24:33.700
Doctor, I really have to go home.

24:33.917 --> 24:35.828
I'm so sorry.

24:36.042 --> 24:40.456
I'll keep my eye on him, so don't worry.

24:40.667 --> 24:43.409
Let's chat further
if others aren't doing so good.

24:43.583 --> 24:44.743
Okay.

25:15.292 --> 25:16.292
Yes, Mr. hwang.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.322
I think this was a problem
of due diligence.

25:20.667 --> 25:24.580
The takeover was done without
ever considering contingent liability.

25:24.958 --> 25:28.655
So the loansharks sold
off all viable animals?

25:28.792 --> 25:30.157
That's right, sir.

25:31.208 --> 25:32.618
So what's the problem?

25:33.875 --> 25:36.912
There aren't any animals
in the zoo, so how...

25:37.042 --> 25:38.782
File any necessary expenses.

25:39.042 --> 25:42.910
Even if we have the money,
we can't procure animals on demand.

25:44.125 --> 25:44.955
Hey, kang.

25:45.125 --> 25:48.663
I've transferred all zoo authority to you!

25:48.750 --> 25:52.368
I've given you a chance,
but you just won't grab it.

25:52.458 --> 25:53.458
Not at all, sir.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.491
Too bad, if it's too hard, come back.

25:56.583 --> 25:59.370
No, I'll do it, I can do this, sir!

26:05.125 --> 26:10.119
Even so, what can he do
without any animals?

26:10.208 --> 26:13.325
If he's got none,
maybe he'll steal some from other zoos.

26:13.542 --> 26:15.902
He grew up like weed,
so his survival instinct will kick in.

26:16.167 --> 26:18.874
This job isn't for those grew up softly.

26:30.750 --> 26:34.197
Ow, my head...

26:35.458 --> 26:37.198
Director, what's this photo?

26:37.792 --> 26:38.792
My head...

26:44.083 --> 26:46.165
It's my daughter, who's studying abroad.

26:46.417 --> 26:47.417
No.

26:48.583 --> 26:49.914
This one.

26:52.500 --> 26:55.242
That's not my daughter,

26:55.417 --> 27:00.207
we had an animal costume event 2 years ago.

27:01.708 --> 27:03.744
I heard kids loved that kinda thing,

27:03.833 --> 27:06.245
but it was a bust,
so the suits are in the storage.

27:06.333 --> 27:07.493
Jesus Christ...

27:07.583 --> 27:08.993
My head...

27:16.458 --> 27:18.039
Are you insane?

27:18.625 --> 27:20.240
Wear animal suits?

27:20.333 --> 27:22.915
You call this scheme a viable plan?

27:25.292 --> 27:26.452
Let's call it bold.

27:26.542 --> 27:29.124
We all can get arrested for fraud!

27:29.708 --> 27:33.872
I was shocked to see
a stuffed tiger last night, why?

27:33.958 --> 27:36.449
You were drunk beyond reason.

27:36.542 --> 27:41.081
No, because this is a zoo.

27:46.042 --> 27:48.158
It's a hidden camera from an overseas zoo.

27:48.917 --> 27:51.499
If you look closely, you
can tell it's a man,

27:51.583 --> 27:53.073
but everyone's fooled!

27:53.167 --> 27:57.991
Because it's at a zoo,
no one expects fake animals!

27:58.083 --> 28:00.244
This guy's not sane.

28:00.333 --> 28:01.698
This meeting is pointless.

28:01.833 --> 28:06.122
I'm the idiot for having some faith in him.

28:07.417 --> 28:09.373
Come on, let's all leave.

28:09.458 --> 28:10.868
I'm staying.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.240
Sir!

28:12.417 --> 28:17.616
If it means I can save the zoo,
I'll even drink the sewage water.

28:17.917 --> 28:19.157
3 months.

28:19.875 --> 28:22.912
In 3 months, we can bring the animals back.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.036
We must bring back our animals first.

28:25.167 --> 28:26.452
Right, our animals.

28:26.542 --> 28:30.364
It tears me apart to think
where they are and how badly...

28:30.500 --> 28:31.535
They're treated.

28:31.750 --> 28:33.365
You haven't even seen them.

28:33.458 --> 28:37.326
Imagine your pain, when
it hurts me this badly.

28:37.875 --> 28:39.226
- Hye-kyung, will you stay?
- Seriously?

28:39.250 --> 28:43.072
If we stay far away from the fence,
it could be convincing.

28:43.167 --> 28:47.080
Hye-kyung, don't fall for this, gun-wook!
Snap out of it!

28:49.542 --> 28:53.785
I have to come by everyday
to feed rest of the animals...

28:53.875 --> 28:55.786
Of course! We just gotta try it!

28:56.125 --> 28:57.661
How do we make the suits?

28:57.750 --> 28:58.455
Director!

28:58.542 --> 29:01.284
What we have now is hardly convincing.

29:01.375 --> 29:05.118
Absolutely, so we leave it
to the professionals.

29:06.833 --> 29:08.949
- Do whatever you want.
- Dr. han...

29:11.958 --> 29:13.789
One less person won't be a problem.

29:13.958 --> 29:18.827
As per regulation, we need a vet at a zoo.

29:19.250 --> 29:20.535
Yeah?

29:38.750 --> 29:40.911
I was told you became a vet because of him.

29:41.167 --> 29:45.035
Came to see him every day
since elementary school?

29:45.417 --> 29:46.907
Black nose is...

29:47.292 --> 29:48.953
My family.

29:50.250 --> 29:52.286
I'm responsible for him until the end.

29:53.208 --> 29:56.405
The zoo must survive
so that you can take care of him.

30:00.000 --> 30:04.699
Trust me, I can pull this off.

30:18.667 --> 30:21.500
Mr. song recommended you highly.

30:21.583 --> 30:23.289
He said you can make anything.

30:23.417 --> 30:28.241
When I was scammed out of film budget,
he helped me out.

30:28.500 --> 30:30.206
As I've mentioned over the phone...

30:30.333 --> 30:32.699
You need animal suits, right?

30:32.792 --> 30:35.659
Yes, we're holding an event,

30:36.500 --> 30:39.458
and we need realistic suits.

30:39.542 --> 30:41.578
So for example,

30:41.667 --> 30:44.784
if we wore it inside a cage,

30:44.917 --> 30:48.990
people shouldn't know it's us in there.

30:49.125 --> 30:55.530
That's just an example,
but it'll look fake, right?

30:59.500 --> 31:00.535
It's possible.

31:01.667 --> 31:05.285
It's used frequently in
Hollywood film commercials.

31:05.417 --> 31:06.782
It's convincing.

31:07.375 --> 31:08.375
It's possible.

31:08.458 --> 31:11.245
- Even in Hollywood...
- It's possible.

31:13.167 --> 31:15.328
Then which animals are possible?

31:15.417 --> 31:17.282
It's gotta be worn by humans, so...

31:17.375 --> 31:18.410
Anything's possible.

31:18.500 --> 31:19.500
Pardon?

31:19.958 --> 31:23.496
Take your pick, I'll make them all.

31:23.792 --> 31:25.783
Lion? Tiger?

31:26.125 --> 31:27.410
Giraffe?

31:27.792 --> 31:28.792
Dinosaur?

31:28.917 --> 31:30.157
All possible?

31:30.750 --> 31:31.990
Of course.

31:32.167 --> 31:33.452
Excuse me...

31:35.042 --> 31:37.749
Felines like lions and tigers walk

31:37.833 --> 31:41.030
on tip of their paws, so
they're not bi-pedal.

31:41.875 --> 31:45.242
Wouldn't be more natural for us
to wear polar bear or gorilla suits

31:45.333 --> 31:47.415
that can walk on their feet?

31:47.542 --> 31:50.784
Then I'll start with
polar bear and gorilla,

31:50.875 --> 31:54.538
oh this, how about sloth?

31:56.000 --> 31:57.865
It'd be perfect for someone to wear it.

31:57.958 --> 32:00.825
But sloths are this big, about 60cm long.

32:03.042 --> 32:07.160
If you're far away, who can tell?

32:07.667 --> 32:11.535
You said it's an event, let's add a sloth.

32:12.667 --> 32:14.999
Lion? What about a lion?

32:15.125 --> 32:18.413
You just lie down, and no one can tell.

32:19.292 --> 32:22.159
It'd be good to have...

32:22.250 --> 32:24.206
Let's add a lion.

32:24.750 --> 32:28.663
This, giraffe is really possible.

32:31.542 --> 32:33.328
Other animals are one thing,

32:34.208 --> 32:36.620
but how can we fit inside a giraffe?

32:38.625 --> 32:42.618
Head and neck are one unit,
and put 2 people inside the body,

32:42.792 --> 32:44.077
it's possible.

32:47.750 --> 32:49.331
He's confident.

32:51.000 --> 32:55.664
But it's more expensive than others.

32:56.542 --> 32:59.500
How soon can you make them?

33:00.333 --> 33:05.407
If you pay 50% up front,
we'll start the work,

33:06.250 --> 33:07.990
and finish them in 2 weeks.

33:12.458 --> 33:15.621
Why? Too long? Then 10 days?

33:15.708 --> 33:18.700
Faster the better for us,
but aren't you rushing it?

33:19.208 --> 33:21.824
Then let's sign the contract!

33:23.292 --> 33:26.910
Giraffe, polar bear, gorilla,

33:27.917 --> 33:30.158
boar, no, not that one.

33:30.625 --> 33:32.161
You won't work alone, right?

33:32.250 --> 33:34.161
No, my staff went to lunch.

33:36.208 --> 33:38.540
- You sure about dinosaur?
- No dinosaur.

33:40.625 --> 33:43.492
The gorilla is supposedly the heaviest,

33:44.250 --> 33:47.287
so can gun-wook wear that?

33:47.417 --> 33:48.657
What?

33:49.583 --> 33:51.198
Sure, why not.

33:52.167 --> 33:54.499
I want to ask for the last time,

33:54.833 --> 33:56.994
do you think this is all possible?

33:57.583 --> 34:00.620
Polar bear should be worn by a man too.

34:00.833 --> 34:04.200
I have to direct this, so I can't do that.

34:05.625 --> 34:07.741
Then you're out,

34:09.542 --> 34:12.375
and I'll do it, since I ruined the zoo.

34:15.208 --> 34:18.826
Lion and sloth are left...

34:20.208 --> 34:22.790
Dr. han, what do you want to do?

34:22.917 --> 34:26.534
I'll stand by with the first aid kit
in case someone passes out.

34:27.542 --> 34:29.373
Hye-kyung, be the sloth.

34:30.667 --> 34:32.077
It's the lightest, call dips!

34:32.583 --> 34:33.914
Dips on sloth!

34:34.000 --> 34:35.409
Then Dr. han is lion.

34:35.542 --> 34:36.782
I said I won't do it!

34:36.875 --> 34:40.242
It's all settled then,
so practice your parts.

34:40.625 --> 34:42.239
Like hell I'll do it...

35:04.250 --> 35:06.101
"What do you have for lunch?
Lunchbox at the shop? Lunchbox for me too."

35:06.125 --> 35:07.285
Hye-kyung!

35:07.750 --> 35:08.750
Let's focus!

35:08.792 --> 35:10.999
Don't shout at her!

35:11.333 --> 35:14.200
Suits arrive on Wednesday,
and we re-open on Friday,

35:14.792 --> 35:16.157
this won't do!

35:16.250 --> 35:19.538
We're taking care of remaining animals,
we got no time for this!

35:21.500 --> 35:23.456
Can't we get part-timers and train them?

35:23.542 --> 35:25.578
There's no guarantee
they'll keep our secret.

35:26.417 --> 35:28.248
Practicing is the only way.

35:28.417 --> 35:31.955
Practice whenenver you can, you understand?

35:40.583 --> 35:43.370
I'm sick and tired of this.

35:44.250 --> 35:46.536
Let's just give this up!

35:46.625 --> 35:48.536
This looks so stupid!

35:48.625 --> 35:49.740
Gun-wook,

35:49.917 --> 35:53.284
that was so good!
You looked like a real gorilla!

35:53.375 --> 35:54.375
Yeah?

35:59.708 --> 36:02.450
Practicing is the only
way, director, Dr. han!

36:02.958 --> 36:05.290
Do your best! Let's do this!

36:08.667 --> 36:09.907
Dongsan park is re-opening.

36:10.000 --> 36:10.785
Thank you.

36:10.792 --> 36:11.872
Dongsan park is re-opening.

36:11.958 --> 36:13.878
"Dongsan park is re-opening.
Admission 50% off."

36:30.417 --> 36:33.124
Walking on four feet too long
could damage your spine,

36:33.208 --> 36:35.824
so sit as much as you can.

36:36.500 --> 36:37.615
Chest pump properly...

36:44.292 --> 36:45.998
"Dongsan park tickets"

37:00.083 --> 37:02.244
Our headsets are all connected,

37:02.333 --> 37:04.665
so just move to my order.

37:04.958 --> 37:06.869
See the hose in the mouth?

37:07.000 --> 37:08.661
You can drink through that.

37:09.167 --> 37:12.364
All right, lift your front right leg.

37:14.083 --> 37:16.290
Front right arm.

37:16.500 --> 37:17.660
If you fold that,

37:19.542 --> 37:21.578
very good, a roar sound will play.

37:21.792 --> 37:22.998
All right!

37:23.792 --> 37:26.454
Let's put the mask on.

37:31.375 --> 37:32.375
Scratchy...

37:34.833 --> 37:36.494
So claustrophobic.

37:36.583 --> 37:38.824
It's so itchy, my skin is sensitive.

37:38.917 --> 37:42.284
It's too tight in here,
I won't last 10 minutes!

37:42.375 --> 37:44.661
Be a man, this is nothing.

37:44.750 --> 37:46.081
Wait a minute...

37:47.000 --> 37:49.036
I think there's a mistake with one costume.

37:49.833 --> 37:50.663
Which one?

37:50.833 --> 37:52.289
Isn't that...

37:53.292 --> 37:56.455
Chewbacca from star wars?

37:57.792 --> 37:59.623
Jesus, what is that?

38:00.292 --> 38:01.292
Me?

38:01.375 --> 38:02.990
Why did we get Chewbacca?

38:05.542 --> 38:07.123
I'm sloth!

38:07.333 --> 38:08.869
Right, sloth.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.366
- You guys are terrible.
- I'm sorry.

38:12.083 --> 38:13.414
Hye-kyung, you look good.

38:13.542 --> 38:17.706
Let's get into position as you practiced.

38:19.625 --> 38:21.035
I need to hang somewhere...

38:22.125 --> 38:23.365
Left leg? Or was it right leg?

38:27.125 --> 38:28.661
Man, this is so embarrassing.

38:28.792 --> 38:30.532
Why is this so heavy?

38:31.542 --> 38:34.864
What am I doing, this is crazy...

38:35.167 --> 38:36.577
So comfy...

38:40.792 --> 38:44.910
No comments? Are we convincing?

38:46.792 --> 38:48.328
Let's all move back.

38:49.708 --> 38:51.198
To where sloth is.

38:51.292 --> 38:53.499
- So heavy...
- I can't stretch my back.

38:56.583 --> 38:57.914
I'm so tired...

38:58.917 --> 39:00.908
So? Were you fooled?

39:01.417 --> 39:03.123
Please move back further.

39:03.333 --> 39:06.166
We'll need some distance from the fence.

39:06.375 --> 39:08.161
There isn't anything to hang off...

39:08.250 --> 39:09.865
How much further?

39:10.000 --> 39:12.036
It's too far back...

39:13.917 --> 39:15.202
Is this good?

39:16.750 --> 39:18.331
Further back once more!

39:18.542 --> 39:21.329
Why don't you move back?

39:21.583 --> 39:23.699
Whatever, I'm done.

39:23.958 --> 39:25.823
My feet hurt...

39:26.667 --> 39:28.328
My knees...

39:28.958 --> 39:32.780
We must stay in the
farthest spot in the pit,

39:32.958 --> 39:36.121
hiding behind trees or rocks,

39:36.250 --> 39:39.287
so people can watch from furthest point.

39:39.958 --> 39:41.243
Who?

39:42.208 --> 39:43.698
Our guests.

39:47.167 --> 39:49.829
"Grand re-opening 50% off admission"

39:51.667 --> 39:56.081
as a practice run, we're
opening on a weekday.

39:56.208 --> 39:57.698
Until people come in,

39:57.875 --> 39:59.206
can't we take the suits off?

39:59.292 --> 40:00.122
No!

40:00.250 --> 40:02.787
As soon as the zoo opens, we're live.

40:02.875 --> 40:05.582
You won't say that if you wear this.

40:05.833 --> 40:06.833
And...

40:07.500 --> 40:10.116
I have claustrophobia.

40:10.500 --> 40:12.365
Why didn't you tell me that earlier?

40:12.458 --> 40:14.369
I just found out.

40:15.750 --> 40:16.750
Guests! Guests!

40:16.833 --> 40:20.246
Our first guests are kindergarten kids.

40:25.542 --> 40:27.908
All right, all right!
Another vehicle just came in!

40:28.000 --> 40:29.240
The seniors, maybe?

40:29.333 --> 40:32.166
It'll be a piece of cake
fooling seniors and kids.

40:32.292 --> 40:35.034
The first course is sloth...

40:36.167 --> 40:38.533
Hye-kyung, get off your phone!

40:39.583 --> 40:41.869
Don't ever lock eyes with the guests.

40:41.958 --> 40:44.995
Gorilla, stay away from the fence,
maintain distance.

40:45.167 --> 40:45.997
So itchy...

40:46.083 --> 40:47.163
Lion! What are you doing?!

40:47.250 --> 40:48.114
It's so itchy!

40:48.208 --> 40:49.243
Suck it up!

40:49.708 --> 40:51.869
Lastly, just remember one thing!

40:52.583 --> 40:55.199
No one in this world

40:55.333 --> 40:57.995
ever thinks that
there are fake animals in zoos.

40:58.458 --> 41:01.495
Teacher! What's that?

41:01.625 --> 41:03.456
That is...

41:03.542 --> 41:05.828
An Amazon giant sloth.

41:05.917 --> 41:08.624
The biggest species of sloth,

41:08.708 --> 41:14.453
and one of the rarest in the world,
and endangered too.

41:14.583 --> 41:16.995
Sloth, you're doing well.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.786
I'm about to fall...

41:18.875 --> 41:20.411
So disgusting.

41:20.542 --> 41:22.874
Children, shall we check out other animals?

41:22.958 --> 41:24.038
Yes!

41:24.250 --> 41:25.706
This is so hard...

41:25.792 --> 41:27.248
You're doing so well.

41:27.833 --> 41:30.415
Hold on, you have to!

41:35.583 --> 41:36.868
Lion, stay down!

41:36.958 --> 41:38.268
- Don't stand around!
- Okay, I hear you.

41:38.292 --> 41:40.704
- The other way!
- Which way is front?

41:41.042 --> 41:42.407
It's a lion!

41:49.292 --> 41:50.748
It's a lion!

41:51.042 --> 41:52.953
Lion! Hi!

41:53.500 --> 41:56.287
Teacher, I want to see lion's tail.

41:56.375 --> 41:58.866
Kids, shall we move to the side
so we can see the tail?

41:58.958 --> 41:59.993
- Okay!
- Sure!

42:00.083 --> 42:01.493
Lion, they can't see your body!

42:01.583 --> 42:02.698
No, no, no!

42:05.875 --> 42:07.615
It's the front again.

42:08.458 --> 42:10.949
What's with that lion?

42:16.875 --> 42:18.536
That looks like a monkey,

42:18.708 --> 42:20.994
but it's so big.

42:23.083 --> 42:26.530
Since it's so big, maybe it's orangutan.

42:31.083 --> 42:35.156
Look at those big titties,
it must be a female.

42:35.917 --> 42:38.989
Gorilla, chill out, they'll figure you out!

42:39.292 --> 42:40.372
Come this way!

42:40.458 --> 42:41.458
Kids, over here.

42:43.125 --> 42:45.161
It's a polar bear!

42:45.667 --> 42:47.498
This is bad...

42:47.667 --> 42:49.407
What do I do...

42:49.500 --> 42:52.947
Kids, this is the polar bear
that lives in north pole!

42:53.042 --> 42:54.282
Where is he?

42:54.375 --> 42:56.991
Teacher, I can't see it.

42:58.375 --> 43:02.493
Kids! Let's go to the
side so we can see him.

43:02.583 --> 43:04.039
- Okay!
- This way!

43:09.167 --> 43:10.873
This is really bad...

43:10.958 --> 43:11.868
What am I doing...

43:11.958 --> 43:13.664
I can't see him!

43:14.000 --> 43:15.285
Come on out!

43:15.417 --> 43:17.408
Why are there so many?

43:17.500 --> 43:19.741
Polar bear, come forward
a bit, it's all right.

43:19.833 --> 43:22.370
My legs are shaking, I can't move.

43:22.458 --> 43:24.449
I'll be exposed...

43:24.542 --> 43:27.375
Go out and walk around
once, it'll be quick.

43:28.667 --> 43:32.865
I'm a polar bear, I'm a polar bear...

43:34.125 --> 43:36.992
Teacher, polar bear must be cold.

43:37.083 --> 43:40.826
Kids! The polar bear usually
lives in cold north pole,

43:40.917 --> 43:43.875
so he feels colder in
Korea, which is warmer.

43:47.458 --> 43:50.905
They want to see animals being cute,
and you can't do that?

43:51.000 --> 43:52.911
Hide appropriately and
be cute appropriately!

43:53.000 --> 43:55.537
If you think that's so
easy, do it yourself!

43:56.333 --> 43:59.700
Take care of your own suits,
and let's do better tomorrow.

44:02.292 --> 44:03.372
Dang it!

44:05.833 --> 44:08.495
It should roar like this.

44:08.625 --> 44:11.412
- It's not moving at all.
- Fascinating, right?

44:12.083 --> 44:14.950
Lion, good posture.

44:15.042 --> 44:18.079
Right, chill and cool.

44:18.792 --> 44:19.998
Good.

44:20.333 --> 44:21.743
Let's go see other animals.

44:21.833 --> 44:23.619
- Hold my hand.
- Let's go.

44:28.125 --> 44:29.581
So itchy!

44:31.500 --> 44:32.956
Itchy! Itchy!

44:36.292 --> 44:37.532
Lion!

44:40.417 --> 44:41.532
Mommy!

44:43.875 --> 44:45.411
Hi, lion!

44:45.500 --> 44:46.114
Fake!

44:46.208 --> 44:47.948
Let's go see the polar bear.

44:49.208 --> 44:51.665
- No lion! Fake!
- Go!

44:51.833 --> 44:54.540
Yo, let us see your face!

44:57.917 --> 44:59.498
Don't do that to animals.

45:01.500 --> 45:03.161
Don't do that to humans!

45:03.667 --> 45:05.032
Put that down!

45:10.625 --> 45:11.990
He's so shy.

45:15.792 --> 45:17.532
Come out to the front.

45:17.875 --> 45:19.240
Don't worry, they can't tell.

45:19.333 --> 45:20.333
Dammit...

45:22.583 --> 45:24.119
Here he comes!

45:25.042 --> 45:26.657
So cool...

45:27.000 --> 45:28.240
He's going into water!

45:28.333 --> 45:29.573
Don't get your fur wet!

45:29.667 --> 45:30.952
It's really expensive!

45:36.125 --> 45:40.414
It's not moving at all, maybe it's a doll.

45:41.542 --> 45:42.782
Let's go.

45:48.583 --> 45:50.744
48 adults.

45:51.750 --> 45:53.957
25 children.

45:54.333 --> 45:55.789
73 total.

45:57.375 --> 45:59.036
73 is...

45:59.750 --> 46:02.116
Worse than before we closed down.

46:03.000 --> 46:04.456
Much less.

46:04.792 --> 46:06.077
Are you going to continue?

46:06.167 --> 46:07.703
Not like this though.

46:07.792 --> 46:10.204
Right? Then let's...

46:10.292 --> 46:11.998
We really need a giraffe.

46:14.833 --> 46:16.869
Every zoo should have a giraffe.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.740
I knew it.

46:27.208 --> 46:31.827
A loser who takes full advantage of a girl

46:32.375 --> 46:34.491
because he thinks he's a pretty boy.

46:34.958 --> 46:38.200
Maybe they have a reason.

46:38.708 --> 46:40.494
He just broke up with her.

46:43.542 --> 46:45.658
You know full well,

46:46.250 --> 46:51.165
he came here frequently to hit on her.

46:52.875 --> 46:56.447
I'm so tired, what the hell are we doing?

46:56.542 --> 46:57.998
5 years!

46:58.375 --> 47:01.663
She lent him 5-year worth of her savings!

47:03.292 --> 47:05.157
What a bastard!

47:05.292 --> 47:06.907
This shop is mine.

47:07.125 --> 47:10.083
I can close up whenever
and no one can say crap.

47:12.667 --> 47:13.827
No.

47:14.208 --> 47:16.039
I love you more.

47:40.417 --> 47:41.748
Help!

47:42.042 --> 47:43.157
Help!

47:45.792 --> 47:48.204
A... gorilla?

47:49.250 --> 47:50.615
Yes, a gorilla.

47:50.792 --> 47:52.407
Someone who looked like a gorilla?

47:52.917 --> 47:54.077
No.

47:55.417 --> 47:59.160
A real gorilla, it escaped from the zoo.

48:00.667 --> 48:02.783
Is there a security camera?

48:03.042 --> 48:04.657
Can we see the footages?

48:06.500 --> 48:07.865
It took it.

48:08.042 --> 48:09.157
What?

48:30.375 --> 48:32.161
You're just gonna leave?

48:32.542 --> 48:34.328
Stop with your lies!

48:35.417 --> 48:37.499
You should've said it was
a boar or something.

48:49.458 --> 48:53.406
No one will notice as long as
you don't get too close!

48:54.333 --> 48:55.743
Be confident!

49:00.500 --> 49:03.116
- Director kang?
- Yes?

49:03.708 --> 49:06.040
Do we need to continue
even without anyone here?

49:06.292 --> 49:08.783
Not again, we just haven't
promoted properly.

49:09.083 --> 49:11.574
Can't we promote then start over?

49:11.875 --> 49:13.285
I'm not feeling well.

49:13.375 --> 49:16.162
Did someone leave a phone here?
I hear a ringing.

49:16.542 --> 49:19.579
It might be mine, who's the caller?

49:19.708 --> 49:22.450
No name, just a heart emoji.

49:22.542 --> 49:23.873
I'll be right there!

49:23.958 --> 49:25.914
After we close, it's almost opening time!

49:26.000 --> 49:28.412
There's still time! I'm coming!

49:37.792 --> 49:39.623
So you won't answer me?

49:40.042 --> 49:41.202
The number you have dialed...

49:41.250 --> 49:44.287
Where did she get the
idea to train a gorilla?

49:57.292 --> 50:00.250
They let all the animals out of the cage?

50:10.167 --> 50:11.498
Damn...

50:12.792 --> 50:14.157
Dang it!

50:18.000 --> 50:19.865
Stop! Stop right there!

50:20.000 --> 50:21.331
But there's no time!

50:21.417 --> 50:23.999
I paid you in full, what's taking so long?!

50:25.542 --> 50:27.828
I'm picking it up tomorrow,
so have the giraffe ready!

50:27.917 --> 50:29.498
Please help!

50:29.583 --> 50:31.369
Help me out here! Please!

50:32.042 --> 50:33.327
What was that?

50:34.708 --> 50:35.708
Hye-kyung?

50:36.333 --> 50:37.333
Hye-kyung!

50:38.208 --> 50:39.869
Hye-kyung! Who's that?!

50:40.000 --> 50:42.457
Please help!

50:55.000 --> 50:56.410
What are you?

50:56.958 --> 50:58.038
You can't leave!

51:09.792 --> 51:10.792
Help!

51:11.000 --> 51:13.867
Gorilla! Gorilla!

51:33.292 --> 51:36.079
It's not a big wound,
it'll heal up quickly.

51:36.375 --> 51:37.490
Okay.

51:38.417 --> 51:42.831
Thank you very much, Ms. lion.

51:44.958 --> 51:46.494
Are you guys nuts?

51:47.500 --> 51:49.957
How could you run a zoo with animals suits?

51:50.542 --> 51:53.033
I'm really sorry about
your convenience store.

51:53.250 --> 51:55.582
My shop isn't the problem.

51:55.667 --> 51:57.203
You're a lawyer,

51:57.292 --> 51:59.328
I can't let this one slide.

51:59.417 --> 52:01.999
How could a lawyer try to scam people?

52:02.125 --> 52:03.535
You're the scammer!

52:03.625 --> 52:04.364
Easy!

52:04.458 --> 52:06.699
How did I scam?!

52:06.792 --> 52:10.239
Took money from your girlfriend
and forced her to work!

52:10.333 --> 52:12.226
You sucked all life out of her
and threw her out!

52:12.250 --> 52:15.322
That's enough! Who threw out whom?!

52:15.708 --> 52:17.664
No one threw me away!

52:17.792 --> 52:19.828
It's offensive so don't use that phrase!

52:32.250 --> 52:33.456
What happened?

52:34.208 --> 52:36.574
Hye-kyung wants to talk to him privately.

52:39.208 --> 52:42.871
They were lovers, maybe
he'll turn a blind eye.

52:44.250 --> 52:45.740
Like hell he will.

52:46.875 --> 52:48.911
Don't you know him by now?

52:49.458 --> 52:52.996
You got no right to shout!
This is all because of you!

53:03.500 --> 53:04.910
Gun-wook.

53:09.625 --> 53:11.616
Apologize to sung-min.

53:14.250 --> 53:17.913
If you apologize sincerely,
he'll let this one go.

53:43.625 --> 53:44.910
I'm sorry.

53:47.667 --> 53:48.873
Pardon?

53:50.708 --> 53:53.780
I didn't hear a thing.

54:06.208 --> 54:09.280
I sincerely apologize.

54:11.333 --> 54:13.790
Please forgive us just this once.

54:14.375 --> 54:18.197
I'll let this one go for hye-kyung's sake.

54:18.958 --> 54:22.746
This zoo has to be successful
for my shop to do well.

54:23.083 --> 54:25.916
We'll pay for the damages to your shop.

54:26.292 --> 54:29.284
I'm gonna keep my eye on you all.

54:37.667 --> 54:38.998
Bastard...

54:59.083 --> 55:00.323
Who are you?

55:00.750 --> 55:02.661
Where did Mr. ko go?

55:03.042 --> 55:04.282
Are you here to collect debt?

55:04.375 --> 55:05.410
Debt?

55:05.625 --> 55:07.661
He took off overnight.

55:07.875 --> 55:10.662
I shouldn't have let him take the deposit.

55:13.208 --> 55:14.539
Giraffe!

55:16.125 --> 55:19.117
Giraffe! My giraffe!

55:49.375 --> 55:51.366
"Giraffe has joined our family!"

55:55.083 --> 55:57.540
The giraffe will come, wait a little bit.

55:58.125 --> 55:59.661
It'll come out soon.

55:59.750 --> 56:00.750
Be patient.

56:00.792 --> 56:03.078
There it is! Look!

56:03.250 --> 56:04.456
It's so big!

56:04.625 --> 56:06.490
Huge!

56:07.625 --> 56:09.536
- Baby, look...
- Mom.

56:09.667 --> 56:11.282
Is the giraffe sick? Oh no!

56:11.292 --> 56:12.907
It'll come out.

56:17.750 --> 56:20.332
- It's back!
- There it is again!

56:20.417 --> 56:21.873
Is it playing hide-and-seek?

56:21.958 --> 56:23.448
Yeah, hide-and-seek with you.

56:25.292 --> 56:28.580
He was like that before, is he sick?

56:32.250 --> 56:35.322
This is no fun at all.

56:36.458 --> 56:38.369
What a waste of money, let's go.

56:54.042 --> 56:56.829
He's fatigued, he needs his rest.

56:59.917 --> 57:02.329
Is black nose not back to himself yet?

57:04.167 --> 57:06.954
You just use humans and
animals so freely, huh?

57:07.417 --> 57:09.658
We should have never done this.

57:10.250 --> 57:12.741
Then what? We don't even have animals.

57:12.833 --> 57:14.949
Then do it yourself!

57:15.083 --> 57:17.369
You gave yourself a comfy role!

57:18.042 --> 57:20.829
I'm incompetent and so frail...

57:20.917 --> 57:22.202
Get some rest.

57:22.292 --> 57:24.123
No, director kang.

57:26.917 --> 57:30.205
I ruined this zoo, I don't deserve to rest.

57:30.458 --> 57:33.325
Will you stop saying that?

57:33.500 --> 57:37.948
Even if I die, I have to die in the cage...

57:39.167 --> 57:41.203
I ruined this zoo to the ground...

57:41.917 --> 57:44.624
I'll do it, so don't wory about it.

57:50.708 --> 57:52.198
Get some rest here.

57:52.292 --> 57:53.623
Black nose...

57:54.583 --> 57:56.619
We should've sent him to Canada.

57:58.917 --> 58:04.116
I wanted to rest,
but 1 or 2 guests always stared at me.

58:05.667 --> 58:09.364
It was like I was in jail,
I thought I was going crazy.

58:11.417 --> 58:15.740
Maybe that's why
black nose turned out that way.

58:24.667 --> 58:26.749
Jesus!

58:29.375 --> 58:30.911
Even he's fooled.

58:32.292 --> 58:37.036
All right, be confident, I can do this.

58:46.375 --> 58:47.911
Look, look at that.

58:49.250 --> 58:51.662
He's staring at people.

58:53.125 --> 58:55.036
Go on, drink that!

58:55.292 --> 58:56.702
Drink it!

58:58.583 --> 58:59.789
Little punk!

59:01.917 --> 59:04.454
Bud, it's your favorite, Coca-Cola!

59:04.542 --> 59:05.873
You should drink it.

59:06.417 --> 59:07.532
Dammit...

59:11.042 --> 59:12.953
Come on out!

59:13.375 --> 59:15.081
- Come here!
- Come out!

59:15.167 --> 59:16.247
I'll beat you if you don't!

59:16.333 --> 59:17.413
Come out!

59:21.792 --> 59:23.999
- This is no fun.
- Let's go.

59:31.708 --> 59:33.164
All gone?

59:36.667 --> 59:37.952
This is tough.

59:44.667 --> 59:46.498
Dammit!

59:52.167 --> 59:54.874
I'm so thirsty, I'm dying...

01:00:20.792 --> 01:00:23.408
Polar bears really do drink coke!

01:00:24.042 --> 01:00:25.373
- Amazing!
- Holy crap!

01:00:25.458 --> 01:00:26.914
Look! Look!

01:00:27.125 --> 01:00:28.956
The commercial was real!

01:00:30.708 --> 01:00:32.073
Post it on Instagram.

01:00:32.792 --> 01:00:34.453
So dope!

01:00:42.917 --> 01:00:44.123
Hello...

01:00:58.833 --> 01:01:00.824
I must've missed your call.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.616
Being a zoo director is no joke.

01:01:03.833 --> 01:01:05.869
So many things to consider.

01:01:06.583 --> 01:01:07.993
What brings you here?

01:01:09.458 --> 01:01:13.531
Your request for animal purchases
has been approved by Gabriel.

01:01:14.042 --> 01:01:16.658
It's just formality so keep it with you.

01:01:16.792 --> 01:01:19.283
You could've sent a courier.

01:01:20.125 --> 01:01:22.161
Mr. hwang asked me to
check out the progress.

01:01:22.625 --> 01:01:24.161
He doesn't need to worry.

01:01:24.292 --> 01:01:25.782
There aren't many people in the zoo.

01:01:25.875 --> 01:01:28.867
It's not that busy on the weekend.

01:01:31.583 --> 01:01:34.074
Shouldn't it be busier on the weekend?

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:37.333
That's what I thought too,
but the opposite was true.

01:01:38.583 --> 01:01:42.155
Please tell the boss he
doesn't need to worry.

01:01:42.375 --> 01:01:45.572
No, I'll report what I see here.

01:01:45.833 --> 01:01:47.494
- I'll be off then.
- Okay.

01:01:48.667 --> 01:01:49.907
- No need to see me out.
- Okay.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.161
I'll check out other animals on my own.

01:01:52.625 --> 01:01:53.956
Other animals?

01:01:54.583 --> 01:01:56.073
I haven't seen the others yet.

01:01:56.208 --> 01:02:00.577
You acquired gorilla, giraffe, lion,

01:02:01.458 --> 01:02:02.948
and sloth, right?

01:02:08.667 --> 01:02:09.952
Emergency!

01:02:10.042 --> 01:02:12.533
A jh employee will be coming around,

01:02:12.625 --> 01:02:15.412
so be as natural as possible,
this is a live situation.

01:02:17.833 --> 01:02:19.994
I can walk around by myself.

01:02:20.125 --> 01:02:21.331
You can head back inside.

01:02:21.417 --> 01:02:23.533
I'm the director here, I'll guide you.

01:02:28.917 --> 01:02:32.284
You know what,
I've never seen a gorilla in person.

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:33.750
What's its name?

01:02:33.792 --> 01:02:34.792
Name?

01:02:34.875 --> 01:02:37.366
Aren't all zoo animals named?

01:02:42.167 --> 01:02:45.034
It's gorong.

01:02:49.292 --> 01:02:53.205
Gorong looks so natural! Very good!

01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:55.865
Let's go see the next animal.

01:02:55.958 --> 01:02:57.018
No, I'd like to see more...

01:02:57.042 --> 01:02:59.579
It's a long drive back to Seoul,
you need to be haste.

01:03:02.542 --> 01:03:03.952
- Eh?
- What is it?

01:03:04.792 --> 01:03:06.248
It locked eyes with me just now.

01:03:06.583 --> 01:03:07.743
With gorong?

01:03:08.042 --> 01:03:09.407
He's looking away.

01:03:09.542 --> 01:03:11.533
I think he's pretending to look away.

01:03:12.167 --> 01:03:13.532
It's not like he's human.

01:03:13.625 --> 01:03:16.082
I'm sure you're mistaken,
let's go this way.

01:03:17.083 --> 01:03:18.083
He looked again!

01:03:18.125 --> 01:03:20.912
Gorillas are very intelligent,
and staring can be stressful.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.684
- Let's check out the giraffe.
- He looked again!

01:03:22.708 --> 01:03:24.744
- Stop staring.
- He did it again.

01:03:24.833 --> 01:03:26.289
Giraffe's our most iconic animal.

01:03:27.917 --> 01:03:29.999
What is the giraffe's name?

01:03:32.208 --> 01:03:34.574
Girong. It's girong.

01:03:38.417 --> 01:03:39.577
I see...

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.616
You got a good look at the giraffe,
the lion's next.

01:03:44.708 --> 01:03:46.414
Wait, it's not moving at all.

01:03:46.583 --> 01:03:47.413
What?!

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:49.582
Look, not even little.

01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:54.492
Girong! Move a bit!

01:03:54.667 --> 01:03:57.534
It's okay, everything's okay!

01:04:00.292 --> 01:04:02.578
See? He's moving.

01:04:06.583 --> 01:04:08.744
So that's how giraffes move...

01:04:09.417 --> 01:04:11.328
You saw the giraffe, let's go see the lion.

01:04:11.417 --> 01:04:12.417
Okay.

01:04:15.167 --> 01:04:18.830
Lion doesn't move either...

01:04:19.375 --> 01:04:21.331
They're nocturnal animals.

01:04:22.083 --> 01:04:24.119
They don't move in the day.

01:04:24.208 --> 01:04:25.994
Is that so?

01:04:26.583 --> 01:04:28.790
What's the lion's name?

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.365
- Liong.
- Liong.

01:04:33.417 --> 01:04:35.123
All names ends with 'ong'?

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.911
Sloths normally never move.

01:04:39.083 --> 01:04:41.119
I can tell you this with full confidence!

01:04:41.583 --> 01:04:42.948
That's normal.

01:04:43.208 --> 01:04:44.618
It'd be weird if they moved.

01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:45.956
Right...

01:04:47.333 --> 01:04:49.790
Then his name is...

01:04:50.208 --> 01:04:54.531
Slothong? That sounds weird.

01:04:54.625 --> 01:04:55.910
Yeah, weird.

01:04:56.292 --> 01:05:00.535
His name is danglong.

01:05:00.958 --> 01:05:02.664
Danglong.

01:05:03.667 --> 01:05:05.999
He looks tired dangling like that.

01:05:06.083 --> 01:05:09.655
Not at all, he's like that all day.

01:05:11.083 --> 01:05:13.870
Now you've seen everything.
This way please.

01:05:13.875 --> 01:05:14.409
Okay.

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:18.322
The zoo's doing well,
so don't worry about anything.

01:05:19.167 --> 01:05:21.203
Why do you want to come here for?

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.833
To show my kid the zoo and whatnot.

01:05:25.167 --> 01:05:27.579
Go to a bigger zoo, we
barely got any animals.

01:05:27.958 --> 01:05:29.698
Come on, man...

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:33.367
How did the suits come out for the event?

01:05:33.583 --> 01:05:35.039
Don't even mention it,

01:05:35.167 --> 01:05:36.373
Mr. ko, that scheming...

01:05:36.458 --> 01:05:37.573
What about him?

01:05:39.083 --> 01:05:41.449
Never mind, dude, let me ask you something.

01:05:41.542 --> 01:05:42.577
Sure.

01:05:44.167 --> 01:05:49.287
How important is Gabriel as a client to jh?

01:05:50.083 --> 01:05:51.448
Gabriel?

01:05:51.917 --> 01:05:54.954
If they were such an important client,

01:05:57.083 --> 01:05:59.620
boss wouldn't have assigned
this zoo to me, right?

01:05:59.708 --> 01:06:01.869
It's his, a shell company

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:04.745
to manage his slush fund.

01:06:04.917 --> 01:06:06.327
Everyone knows about this?

01:06:06.458 --> 01:06:07.698
Only a few at the firm.

01:06:07.792 --> 01:06:12.161
I only found out when I did
some errands to launder funds.

01:06:13.667 --> 01:06:17.239
Is something wrong? Things not going well?

01:06:18.458 --> 01:06:19.948
Let's talk later.

01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:42.470
- What are you doing?
- Shit! What the shit!

01:06:43.667 --> 01:06:45.157
You scared me!

01:06:45.833 --> 01:06:47.243
Why haven't you gone home yet?

01:06:47.375 --> 01:06:48.740
Isn't it obvious?

01:06:49.583 --> 01:06:53.075
I'm making sure unsold animals are okay.

01:06:53.875 --> 01:06:56.662
I've been playing lion all day long.

01:06:57.833 --> 01:06:59.323
Then keep at it.

01:06:59.583 --> 01:07:03.952
We're all exhausted from looking after
remaining animals after closing.

01:07:04.333 --> 01:07:06.824
You might not care about that.

01:07:09.917 --> 01:07:11.703
What is it that you want to say?

01:07:12.958 --> 01:07:16.826
We're working hard to
get the zoo back in shape,

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.117
bring back our animals,
and create a better environment.

01:07:20.708 --> 01:07:22.949
I just wanted you to know that,

01:07:23.250 --> 01:07:25.161
and not just worry about selling tickets.

01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:28.411
Am I fooling around?

01:07:28.542 --> 01:07:31.284
We need people for this zoo to exist!

01:07:31.375 --> 01:07:33.661
The zoo belongs to the animals, not people!

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:37.117
No! It belongs to
value fyre haus William & Gabriel!

01:07:37.792 --> 01:07:39.748
And did I sell off the animals?

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.867
They'll come back to dirty
and cold cement pits,

01:07:42.958 --> 01:07:44.664
that can't be good for them.

01:07:44.833 --> 01:07:46.994
You said black nose is your family, right?

01:07:47.083 --> 01:07:49.699
If he snaps out of it,
will he recognize you?

01:07:49.792 --> 01:07:54.240
When you're around him,
he only thinks about eating you!

01:07:54.542 --> 01:07:56.999
How does a polar bear
and a human become family?!

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:03.287
You really are a lawyer.

01:08:03.542 --> 01:08:05.248
You talk so damn well!

01:08:38.207 --> 01:08:39.243
What's going on?

01:08:39.332 --> 01:08:41.118
We went viral!

01:08:41.207 --> 01:08:43.323
Because of the coke-drinking polar bear!

01:08:45.417 --> 01:08:47.999
Why did you have to drink coke?!

01:08:49.832 --> 01:08:51.163
I'm sorry.

01:08:53.292 --> 01:08:54.953
I'll make sure no harm is...

01:08:55.042 --> 01:08:59.832
Wait a minute,
did they come knowing that, or...

01:09:00.042 --> 01:09:01.247
Or what?

01:09:17.542 --> 01:09:20.033
Do not shake the railing please!

01:09:20.332 --> 01:09:22.118
Polar bear is coming out!

01:09:22.207 --> 01:09:25.245
Everyone, please maintain order!

01:09:30.582 --> 01:09:32.743
Not you too.

01:09:32.917 --> 01:09:34.327
Are you ready?

01:09:34.667 --> 01:09:37.328
Yes, I guess so.

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:40.288
Thank you for waiting!

01:09:40.832 --> 01:09:43.290
The polar bear is coming now!

01:09:43.625 --> 01:09:46.742
"Please be quiet, he's coming out!"

01:11:06.250 --> 01:11:10.118
"Hold mom and dad's hands and let's go!"

01:11:10.208 --> 01:11:13.166
"To dongsan park, where dreams live"

01:11:13.292 --> 01:11:16.955
"hold friends' hands and let's go!"

01:11:17.292 --> 01:11:19.829
"Our dongsan park!"

01:11:20.375 --> 01:11:23.412
"Greeted by fierce tiger!"

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:27.038
We don't do interviews
because animals can get stressed easily.

01:11:27.125 --> 01:11:29.491
Yes, I'm sorry.

01:11:31.375 --> 01:11:34.333
"Our beloved dongsan park!"

01:11:38.458 --> 01:11:41.325
"Our beloved dongsan park!"

01:11:45.375 --> 01:11:47.286
"Our beloved dongsan park!"

01:11:47.375 --> 01:11:49.832
Over the weekend, we made $100,000!

01:12:02.625 --> 01:12:06.493
"Hold mom and dad's hands and let's go!"

01:12:06.667 --> 01:12:09.579
"To dongsan park, where dreams live"

01:12:09.667 --> 01:12:13.239
"hold friends' hands and let's go!"

01:12:13.625 --> 01:12:16.947
"Our beloved dongsan park!"

01:12:56.250 --> 01:12:58.332
Aren't you checking out?

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000
My feet are asleep...

01:13:00.083 --> 01:13:03.405
Yeah? Your feet? Should I massage you?

01:13:06.542 --> 01:13:10.080
It's because you've been
inside that suit all day!

01:13:10.167 --> 01:13:13.159
Then why are you still wearing it?

01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:15.536
Oh yeah...

01:13:18.667 --> 01:13:24.082
I got so used to it that
it feels weird when I take it off.

01:13:24.917 --> 01:13:27.533
Will you go home when you get off work?

01:13:28.292 --> 01:13:29.748
Yeah, you know.

01:13:31.083 --> 01:13:32.698
Not gonna have dinner?

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.365
Of course I will.

01:13:36.417 --> 01:13:37.577
By yourself?

01:13:40.667 --> 01:13:42.828
Wanna have dinner with me?
But you must be busy...

01:13:42.958 --> 01:13:44.289
What will you have?

01:13:44.417 --> 01:13:46.533
Well, you know, anything...

01:13:46.667 --> 01:13:48.578
I hate the food called 'anything'.

01:13:48.667 --> 01:13:50.623
Then what? What? What do you like?

01:13:50.708 --> 01:13:53.780
Carbonara? Gorgonzola pizza?
Come down here first.

01:13:53.875 --> 01:13:55.206
Give me a sec.

01:13:56.542 --> 01:13:59.079
My arms and legs are stiff...

01:13:59.167 --> 01:14:01.783
Hold onto me, be careful now.

01:14:02.417 --> 01:14:03.907
Careful, there you go.

01:14:05.542 --> 01:14:09.535
That's it, be careful, all done!

01:14:13.792 --> 01:14:17.364
You said you have really
low standards, right?

01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:18.956
I said that?

01:14:19.292 --> 01:14:22.250
You said you don't care about looks.

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:24.828
Is that why you like me?

01:14:24.917 --> 01:14:28.284
No, I have super high standards.

01:14:28.833 --> 01:14:34.373
I only like beautiful,
adorable and attractive girls.

01:14:35.292 --> 01:14:36.748
I'm serious.

01:14:37.083 --> 01:14:40.246
I won't date so carelessly anymore.

01:14:41.208 --> 01:14:43.119
He has to be really nice.

01:14:44.333 --> 01:14:48.997
I'm a good guy with high standards.

01:14:49.833 --> 01:14:52.370
That's why I'm still single.

01:14:55.333 --> 01:14:59.747
I'll take care of it until you graduate,
so don't worry that!

01:15:00.792 --> 01:15:03.124
Who cares if I'm the director or not?

01:15:03.208 --> 01:15:06.280
If the zoo is successful,
that's good for me too!

01:15:08.042 --> 01:15:10.704
He's a smart guy since he's a lawyer.

01:15:12.042 --> 01:15:13.748
Looks aren't everything!

01:15:14.250 --> 01:15:17.447
A man must be capable!

01:15:40.542 --> 01:15:41.406
What are you watching?

01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:42.910
Jesus crap shit!

01:15:53.417 --> 01:15:56.375
Why did you leave the pit gate open?

01:15:56.750 --> 01:16:01.449
Since he can't go outside in the day,
I wanted him to get some fresh air.

01:16:02.833 --> 01:16:04.289
Who's that girl?

01:16:05.375 --> 01:16:08.333
It's me, 20 years ago.

01:16:10.625 --> 01:16:12.331
Then that's black nose?

01:16:12.458 --> 01:16:16.406
Yes. He was fine back then.

01:16:18.875 --> 01:16:20.240
It's stereotypic behavior, right?

01:16:20.375 --> 01:16:25.369
Caged animals exhibiting
unusual behaviors, no?

01:16:27.375 --> 01:16:31.038
It's equivalent to mental
illness in humans.

01:16:32.333 --> 01:16:33.994
You studied.

01:16:34.833 --> 01:16:37.245
You know, just a bit.

01:16:40.375 --> 01:16:43.242
Even if the zoo is spacious
and well decorated,

01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:48.324
it's like being in jail
compared to living in the wild.

01:16:49.417 --> 01:16:51.453
What you said the other day is true.

01:16:52.375 --> 01:16:56.323
This is still a cement jail to them,

01:16:56.500 --> 01:17:00.869
no matter how good we make the environment.

01:17:02.292 --> 01:17:04.908
I'm sorry about the other day.

01:17:05.333 --> 01:17:06.869
I was out of the line.

01:17:09.375 --> 01:17:13.994
After he became like this,
we had a chance to send him abroad.

01:17:14.667 --> 01:17:16.328
A zoo abroad?

01:17:16.625 --> 01:17:19.822
There is a polar bear habitat in Canada,

01:17:20.083 --> 01:17:25.248
a habitat for polar bears that
have difficulty living in the wild,

01:17:25.708 --> 01:17:28.996
which is the closest thing to wildlife.

01:17:29.708 --> 01:17:31.573
Why didn't you send him?

01:17:33.125 --> 01:17:34.911
I wanted to keep him around.

01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:43.325
I thought if I did my best,
he would get better,

01:17:44.625 --> 01:17:47.697
I got no skills, yet I'm so greedy.

01:17:52.833 --> 01:17:54.369
You go ahead.

01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:58.492
I have to check up on a raccoon
that's having a diarrhea problem.

01:18:01.292 --> 01:18:03.283
- I'll head out.
- Okay.

01:18:15.875 --> 01:18:16.705
"Hye-kyung - sloth"

01:18:16.875 --> 01:18:20.288
"director kang!
Thank you so much for saving our zoo!"

01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:25.331
"N "our zoo"?

01:18:29.417 --> 01:18:31.282
Our zoo...

01:18:40.125 --> 01:18:43.367
Total revenue of
$1,000,000 with $700,000 in profit,

01:18:45.917 --> 01:18:47.202
congrats.

01:18:47.333 --> 01:18:50.825
You are now a jh m&a lawyer.

01:18:53.792 --> 01:18:55.077
Thank you, sir.

01:18:55.792 --> 01:18:58.499
I'll do my best to contribute to the firm.

01:18:58.917 --> 01:18:59.917
Do your best.

01:19:00.083 --> 01:19:01.163
Absolutely, sir!

01:19:07.792 --> 01:19:12.456
So who will be managing the zoo now?

01:19:12.583 --> 01:19:16.280
We're gonna bulldoze it and build a resort.

01:19:17.167 --> 01:19:18.167
Pardon?

01:19:29.042 --> 01:19:31.749
The golf course will be
where the zoo is right now.

01:19:38.583 --> 01:19:40.073
'Rakwon resort'?

01:19:40.167 --> 01:19:42.954
You met vp min the other day,

01:19:43.458 --> 01:19:46.575
rakwon purchased over
25 million square feet,

01:19:46.667 --> 01:19:48.407
but couldn't buy the zoo.

01:19:48.583 --> 01:19:51.416
They wanted to buy the zoo
at an auction fire sale,

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:55.118
but Gabriel swooped in and bought it up.

01:19:55.333 --> 01:19:59.997
Rakwon can't stand a zoo
in the middle of their resort.

01:20:01.083 --> 01:20:03.199
So it was just a holdout?

01:20:03.292 --> 01:20:05.954
A lawyer shouldn't use such banal word.

01:20:07.042 --> 01:20:09.454
Anyway, this is all thanks to you.

01:20:10.042 --> 01:20:12.579
We'll sell it at a much higher price
than we thought.

01:20:12.667 --> 01:20:16.535
But sir, the zoo's finally doing well,

01:20:16.875 --> 01:20:18.456
must you sell it now?

01:20:19.333 --> 01:20:21.790
There are animals that need caring,

01:20:21.875 --> 01:20:23.866
and more that need to be brought back.

01:20:23.958 --> 01:20:25.118
Listen, kang.

01:20:25.333 --> 01:20:29.030
Have you been playing a
zoo director's role too hard?

01:20:29.292 --> 01:20:33.615
Animals are one thing,
but the staff will lose their jobs too.

01:20:34.333 --> 01:20:35.448
Kang.

01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:36.990
Yes, sir.

01:20:37.792 --> 01:20:42.991
Rakwon aren't new to this,
they won't stir trouble senselessly.

01:20:43.542 --> 01:20:47.364
They'll follow protocol
and do the right thing.

01:21:07.833 --> 01:21:08.993
Dr. han.

01:21:09.958 --> 01:21:11.698
You really look like a lawyer.

01:21:14.417 --> 01:21:17.489
Did the meeting go well?
What did the firm say?

01:21:18.667 --> 01:21:20.077
Well, that's...

01:21:23.167 --> 01:21:25.032
Did everyone check out?

01:21:25.125 --> 01:21:26.285
Of course.

01:21:28.708 --> 01:21:31.165
Dr. han, I have something to tell you.

01:21:31.292 --> 01:21:34.159
- Let's talk inside.
- Okay, should we?

01:21:38.917 --> 01:21:43.581
Of everyone here at the
zoo, you're the most...

01:21:44.292 --> 01:21:47.125
Logical and composed person.

01:21:47.792 --> 01:21:50.750
Fees like you won't get upset...

01:21:51.125 --> 01:21:53.616
Get upset no matter what.

01:21:55.125 --> 01:21:57.081
They turned off the lights...

01:21:57.083 --> 01:21:58.789
- Congrats, director!
- What the hell?!

01:21:58.792 --> 01:22:00.832
"Congratulating director kang's
75th day on the job"

01:22:01.958 --> 01:22:04.916
- what took you so long?
- Come, come inside!

01:22:05.042 --> 01:22:06.578
But Dr. han...

01:22:07.042 --> 01:22:09.124
Why 75th day? It's not even 100.

01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:11.081
We wanted to thank you,

01:22:11.167 --> 01:22:14.079
we just needed an excuse to celebrate!

01:22:14.167 --> 01:22:16.203
You got what it takes, I admit it.

01:22:16.375 --> 01:22:17.865
Make a wish and blow.

01:22:19.292 --> 01:22:21.203
Blow them out! Hurry, just do it!

01:22:21.292 --> 01:22:22.907
- I'll blow them out...
- Blow!

01:22:25.167 --> 01:22:27.499
Hold on, I have to tell you something.

01:22:27.917 --> 01:22:28.997
They're all here.

01:22:29.083 --> 01:22:30.414
- Already?
- Who's here?

01:22:31.625 --> 01:22:33.081
It's been so long!

01:22:36.542 --> 01:22:38.783
Come in, over here!

01:22:38.875 --> 01:22:41.082
- Good to see you!
- Who are they?

01:22:41.167 --> 01:22:43.158
They were part of dongsan family,

01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:44.956
they wanted to drop by.

01:22:45.042 --> 01:22:46.202
But what if we get caught?

01:22:46.292 --> 01:22:48.374
We'll go out for drinks soon, don't worry.

01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:49.410
Hello!

01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:51.741
All right! Attention!

01:22:51.833 --> 01:22:54.324
Say hello to director kang!

01:22:54.417 --> 01:22:56.578
Thank you, director!

01:22:56.667 --> 01:22:57.577
For what?

01:22:57.667 --> 01:23:04.197
For getting their jobs back after
my incompetency laid them off!

01:23:04.292 --> 01:23:05.122
But sir, that's not...

01:23:05.208 --> 01:23:06.414
Thank you, director...

01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:09.333
You saved my family!

01:23:09.458 --> 01:23:10.117
I did?

01:23:10.208 --> 01:23:12.039
To make ends meet,

01:23:12.125 --> 01:23:16.494
I washed dishes for 2
months at a restaurant...

01:23:21.167 --> 01:23:22.532
Don't cry...

01:23:22.708 --> 01:23:26.621
I told the boss to shove my job
up his ass and ran straight here!

01:23:26.708 --> 01:23:28.018
You shouldn't do that to your boss...

01:23:28.042 --> 01:23:31.534
Come on! Let's have a drink!

01:23:33.208 --> 01:23:35.073
I can't breathe...

01:23:35.167 --> 01:23:37.123
It's my daughter studying abroad,

01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:40.447
she's been working part-time,
but I told her to quit!

01:23:40.542 --> 01:23:42.078
You shouldn't do that...

01:23:42.167 --> 01:23:45.659
Hee-young, thank the director.

01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:46.750
Here, take it.

01:23:47.708 --> 01:23:49.369
Hi, hee-young.

01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:52.742
But please don't quit your job.

01:23:53.083 --> 01:23:54.664
What are you saying!

01:23:56.667 --> 01:23:59.283
Hooray to director kang!

01:24:00.042 --> 01:24:02.579
Hooray to dongsan park!

01:24:02.875 --> 01:24:04.331
Hooray!

01:24:04.417 --> 01:24:06.123
Director seo, have a drink!

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:09.575
I'm not a director, I ruined this place!

01:24:09.667 --> 01:24:10.747
No, no way!

01:24:10.833 --> 01:24:12.824
Ruined it to the ground!

01:24:13.333 --> 01:24:15.619
Mix all the drinks!

01:24:21.292 --> 01:24:23.248
Why are you sweating so much?

01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:27.789
I'm about to puke...

01:24:27.875 --> 01:24:30.742
Let's... come inside for a bit.

01:24:32.250 --> 01:24:33.250
I'm dizzy...

01:24:33.292 --> 01:24:36.034
A bit overwhelming, right?
To have everyone here...

01:24:36.125 --> 01:24:37.365
Here, here.

01:24:41.375 --> 01:24:43.787
What did you want to talk about earlier?

01:24:44.167 --> 01:24:47.489
Today might not be the best day for that.

01:24:47.833 --> 01:24:49.994
You do look pretty bad.

01:24:50.125 --> 01:24:52.081
Today is a hard day, mentally...

01:24:53.083 --> 01:24:55.369
You tired yourself out.

01:24:57.292 --> 01:24:59.328
Thank you so much for your work!

01:24:59.458 --> 01:25:00.698
Dr. han, please...

01:25:00.792 --> 01:25:02.828
What took you so long?! Come over here!

01:25:02.917 --> 01:25:04.623
No, wait, hold on.

01:25:04.792 --> 01:25:07.784
I just spoke to Mr. choi
from department of environment,

01:25:07.875 --> 01:25:12.039
he said a resort will be built on our zoo.

01:25:12.125 --> 01:25:13.740
Your jokes are still not funny.

01:25:13.833 --> 01:25:15.448
No, I'm serious.

01:25:15.542 --> 01:25:17.999
An announcement was made
on city hall homepage,

01:25:18.125 --> 01:25:20.366
about building a golf course
and a ski resort here.

01:25:20.458 --> 01:25:21.368
Seriously?

01:25:21.458 --> 01:25:23.073
You guys never heard about this?

01:25:23.167 --> 01:25:24.373
What are you talking about?

01:25:24.458 --> 01:25:26.198
The city hall announced it.

01:25:26.417 --> 01:25:27.281
Really?

01:25:27.375 --> 01:25:29.286
We should check the homepage.

01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:34.990
What's going on?

01:25:40.375 --> 01:25:43.117
Dongsan city attracts rakwon resort,

01:25:43.208 --> 01:25:48.157
25 million square feet plot
that includes the zoo...

01:25:57.917 --> 01:26:00.203
Don't lie to us and tell us everything.

01:26:00.792 --> 01:26:04.580
It's not true, right? This can't be.

01:26:04.875 --> 01:26:05.990
I'm sorry.

01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:09.491
It's the firm's decision.

01:26:09.958 --> 01:26:11.914
Are you listening to yourself?

01:26:14.083 --> 01:26:15.869
What will happen to us?

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.831
I'm certain you'll be reinstated.

01:26:17.917 --> 01:26:20.579
Rakwon is a big corporation,
so it might be better...

01:26:20.667 --> 01:26:23.955
What can zookeepers do at a ski resort?!

01:26:25.167 --> 01:26:27.123
What's the point of this?

01:26:27.333 --> 01:26:30.166
He fooled us all.

01:26:45.750 --> 01:26:47.456
What about the remaining animals?

01:26:47.667 --> 01:26:51.660
If you know of other zoos
that can take them...

01:26:52.583 --> 01:26:55.325
You should know better than I do...

01:26:55.417 --> 01:26:56.998
What about black nose?

01:26:59.458 --> 01:27:02.040
No one will take him.

01:27:02.833 --> 01:27:03.948
I'm sorry.

01:27:04.125 --> 01:27:06.116
You were our director.

01:27:06.708 --> 01:27:09.290
We got here this far by believing in you.

01:27:09.458 --> 01:27:11.369
But now you're sorry?

01:27:11.833 --> 01:27:15.655
I really didn't know,
I'm not like what you think.

01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:17.832
If you didn't know, you're an idiot.

01:27:18.208 --> 01:27:20.324
But if you knew, then you're...

01:27:32.333 --> 01:27:34.073
I'm sorry, sir.

01:27:34.625 --> 01:27:39.665
If your work here is done,
head back up to Seoul.

01:27:43.042 --> 01:27:45.624
What? Something else?

01:27:46.958 --> 01:27:47.788
What we did...

01:27:47.875 --> 01:27:51.914
I'll make sure no one talks about that,

01:27:53.625 --> 01:27:55.365
so don't worry.

01:28:15.208 --> 01:28:17.324
Hello, I need help.

01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:18.706
This won't work all of sudden.

01:28:18.792 --> 01:28:20.032
Let me see.

01:28:22.042 --> 01:28:23.578
- Say hello.
- Sure.

01:28:23.667 --> 01:28:26.204
I'm kang tae-so0, nice to meet you all.

01:28:31.667 --> 01:28:33.999
"Attorney-at-law kang tae-soo"

01:29:03.083 --> 01:29:03.742
"Rakwon development"

01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:05.365
what's wrong with you?!

01:29:05.542 --> 01:29:08.830
He won't let go of me!

01:29:08.917 --> 01:29:11.408
Do something, get this guy off of me!

01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:13.161
You'll never put your foot inside here!

01:29:13.250 --> 01:29:14.865
Are you nuts? Back the hell off!

01:29:14.958 --> 01:29:19.702
It's my zoo! No one can enter
without my permission!

01:29:19.792 --> 01:29:21.783
Christ!

01:29:25.042 --> 01:29:26.998
- Sir?
- Mister!

01:29:27.083 --> 01:29:28.289
Sir?

01:29:28.417 --> 01:29:30.658
Sir, wake up, are you okay?

01:29:30.750 --> 01:29:32.115
Could you help?

01:29:39.375 --> 01:29:40.660
Director.

01:29:46.250 --> 01:29:48.036
Is it all over?

01:29:51.333 --> 01:29:52.823
No, it's not over.

01:29:55.833 --> 01:29:57.869
Let's reopen the zoo tomorrow.

01:29:58.125 --> 01:30:00.958
"Choose zoo over golf course!
Free admission!"

01:30:17.917 --> 01:30:21.489
Protect our zoo from
violent corporation rakwon!

01:30:22.708 --> 01:30:26.121
Protect us from nature destroyer, rakwon!

01:30:26.333 --> 01:30:29.450
Protect our zoo from
violent corporation rakwon!

01:30:30.125 --> 01:30:33.413
Protect us from nature destroyer, rakwon!

01:30:36.167 --> 01:30:39.034
Violent corporation rakwon
is demolishing nature'?

01:30:39.583 --> 01:30:42.416
Jesus, what do they take me for?

01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:44.832
I'm a member of the green peace!

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.536
Calm down, madame.

01:30:46.625 --> 01:30:49.697
I'll kick them out as soon as possible.

01:30:49.792 --> 01:30:53.239
Are you nuts? Do you not understand
what the problem is?

01:30:53.333 --> 01:30:56.120
Rakwon's image is bad enough
with my brother behind bars,

01:30:56.208 --> 01:30:59.075
are you desperate to bury us for good?

01:30:59.208 --> 01:31:03.030
Don't they know who I am?
A violent corporation?!

01:31:03.667 --> 01:31:06.955
Anyway, this is a breach of contract.

01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:11.493
I'd rather not build a resort!

01:31:11.583 --> 01:31:12.583
Madame.

01:31:12.833 --> 01:31:17.122
There may be a way to force
the zookeepers out quietly.

01:31:17.208 --> 01:31:20.951
Then why did you
let this situation get out of hand?

01:31:21.417 --> 01:31:24.204
If you give me some time,
I'll resolve it peacefully.

01:31:26.667 --> 01:31:27.873
Time?

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:32.490
I'll give you 24 hours.

01:31:34.042 --> 01:31:37.455
But there's no way it can be done in a day.

01:31:37.583 --> 01:31:39.244
Could you wait a week?

01:31:39.375 --> 01:31:41.991
Does this look like a negotiation?

01:31:42.792 --> 01:31:46.159
I'm telling you how it is!

01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:51.492
If this isn't done by
tomorrow, we are done.

01:31:57.125 --> 01:31:58.365
Sir.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.537
- Have you called them?
- They won't take my calls.

01:32:01.625 --> 01:32:04.116
Weren't all animals sold off?
Why do they still have some?

01:32:04.208 --> 01:32:08.121
Paperwork was filed and they're supposed
to be shipped out this week.

01:32:08.292 --> 01:32:10.499
I'll go down right away and talk to them.

01:32:10.583 --> 01:32:12.268
You think talking will
defuse this situation?

01:32:12.292 --> 01:32:14.203
If you promise to rehire them...

01:32:14.292 --> 01:32:15.292
Stop it!

01:32:15.333 --> 01:32:17.449
There's no time for something so trivial!

01:32:18.042 --> 01:32:20.124
How is this trivial?

01:32:20.958 --> 01:32:23.825
I asked for their support
to normalize the zoo,

01:32:23.917 --> 01:32:26.579
so what does that make me?

01:32:27.250 --> 01:32:31.914
Why did you fight with protesters
to get noticed by me?

01:32:33.250 --> 01:32:36.538
You wanted to be a jh
lawyer no matter what!

01:32:36.667 --> 01:32:38.828
So I made you into one!

01:32:39.583 --> 01:32:42.165
What happens to them isn't my business!

01:32:47.667 --> 01:32:48.827
Sir...

01:32:55.083 --> 01:32:57.699
The polar bear was a man in a suit?

01:32:57.958 --> 01:32:59.664
It's not just the polar bear.

01:32:59.750 --> 01:33:02.787
All the animals are
zookeepers in animal suits.

01:33:02.958 --> 01:33:04.118
Any evidence?

01:33:04.375 --> 01:33:06.991
I don't have any but I
saw it with my own eyes.

01:33:07.167 --> 01:33:09.533
I know one of the zookeepers,
so I kept my mouth shut,

01:33:09.708 --> 01:33:15.704
but it's disgusting to see trying
to be social justice warriors about it,

01:33:16.292 --> 01:33:20.365
this could lead to a massive losses...

01:33:20.875 --> 01:33:22.786
What I mean is...

01:33:22.917 --> 01:33:25.454
If what you're saying is true,
we'll reward you fairly.

01:33:26.208 --> 01:33:28.824
Go home and wait for a call from my people.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.366
Could you leave us?

01:33:31.667 --> 01:33:34.079
I'll look forward to hearing from you.

01:33:37.083 --> 01:33:38.323
Thank you.

01:33:46.958 --> 01:33:48.164
What do you think?

01:33:48.375 --> 01:33:51.913
Thinking rationally about this,

01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:56.243
what would he get out of lying
about something so absurd?

01:33:56.792 --> 01:34:00.785
Kang said it was impossible
to get new animals,

01:34:00.875 --> 01:34:04.367
then he suddenly changed his tune.

01:34:05.292 --> 01:34:09.831
Honestly, coke-drinking polar bear
never made any sense.

01:34:10.042 --> 01:34:11.202
Right?

01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:15.572
Did you notice anything
strange about your visit?

01:34:17.292 --> 01:34:19.829
I sensed some weird things.

01:34:20.708 --> 01:34:22.039
Like what?

01:34:23.708 --> 01:34:25.414
The names were weird...

01:34:27.083 --> 01:34:28.198
What?

01:34:28.833 --> 01:34:31.666
All the animal names ended with 'ong'.

01:34:37.250 --> 01:34:38.706
What do you mean?

01:34:39.333 --> 01:34:42.325
And I kept making
eye contacts with the gorilla...

01:34:42.417 --> 01:34:43.998
Stop this nonsense!

01:34:45.167 --> 01:34:49.410
Running a zoo with animal suits?

01:34:52.333 --> 01:34:53.539
Holy crap!

01:34:54.083 --> 01:34:55.619
Why are you here?

01:34:55.875 --> 01:34:59.197
What did you tell Mr. hwang?
Did you tattle on us?

01:35:00.083 --> 01:35:03.701
You thought I'd take
measly $200,000 and piss off?!

01:35:03.792 --> 01:35:05.532
$200,000? What do you mean?

01:35:05.958 --> 01:35:07.198
Come on...

01:35:07.417 --> 01:35:08.998
The loan hye-kyung gave you?

01:35:09.458 --> 01:35:10.458
You didn't know?

01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:15.324
You kept the secret by taking $30,000?

01:35:15.708 --> 01:35:17.790
I heard that was her entire savings.

01:35:17.875 --> 01:35:21.447
Why else? Because it's
got to do with her zoo.

01:35:37.375 --> 01:35:39.491
Black nose is my family.

01:35:39.583 --> 01:35:41.119
I'm responsible for him until the end.

01:35:41.208 --> 01:35:44.746
The zoo must survive so that
you can take care of him.

01:35:44.833 --> 01:35:48.280
Trust me, I can pull this off.

01:35:51.875 --> 01:35:55.447
"Director kang!
Thank you so much for saving our zoo!"

01:35:57.750 --> 01:35:59.160
Dammit...

01:36:08.375 --> 01:36:09.785
That way, sir.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:18.322
I haven't actually seen a sloth in person.

01:36:20.083 --> 01:36:22.290
Polar bear is the most important one.

01:36:23.833 --> 01:36:26.745
Coke-drinking polar bear
will surely look fake.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.662
Why aren't you answering!

01:36:47.125 --> 01:36:48.490
Hye-kyung!

01:36:48.917 --> 01:36:50.498
Why isn't anyone answering my calls?

01:36:50.583 --> 01:36:52.744
You said not to use cell phones
during opening hours!

01:36:52.833 --> 01:36:55.040
But at least one of you
should have it on you!

01:36:56.333 --> 01:36:57.914
Radio everyone right now!

01:36:58.042 --> 01:37:00.033
Jh people are heading
to the polar bear pit!

01:37:00.125 --> 01:37:02.537
We may have been exposed, so get to safety!

01:37:02.875 --> 01:37:05.036
Those two people?

01:37:05.167 --> 01:37:06.247
We've been exposed!

01:37:06.875 --> 01:37:10.288
That jh man is on his way
to the polar bear pit!

01:37:10.625 --> 01:37:12.365
Everyone, be careful.

01:37:25.958 --> 01:37:27.573
Where is the polar bear?

01:37:27.958 --> 01:37:29.494
I don't think it came out yet.

01:37:29.917 --> 01:37:31.498
Look at the time.

01:37:31.792 --> 01:37:34.704
They set up the coke box,
so it should be out soon.

01:37:35.250 --> 01:37:37.036
Where's the door?

01:37:37.333 --> 01:37:38.618
What door, sir?

01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:40.832
There's gotta be one for zookeepers!

01:37:46.458 --> 01:37:48.870
You can't come in here.

01:37:48.958 --> 01:37:49.958
What's this?

01:37:50.042 --> 01:37:51.077
'This'?

01:37:51.333 --> 01:37:53.870
How dare you objectify me?

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.037
You're illegally occupying the zoo,
you have no right whatsoever.

01:37:57.125 --> 01:37:58.285
That's enough.

01:37:58.417 --> 01:38:00.658
I need to see the coke-chugging polar bear.

01:38:01.958 --> 01:38:03.289
Not today.

01:38:03.583 --> 01:38:05.119
Why not today?

01:38:05.625 --> 01:38:09.493
The polar bear is
too stressed to come out today.

01:38:09.792 --> 01:38:12.784
I know what's going on here, let me in!

01:38:12.875 --> 01:38:14.081
Mr. hwang!

01:38:23.833 --> 01:38:26.199
Kang, I'll give you one last chance,

01:38:26.958 --> 01:38:31.907
if you tell me the truth,
you won't be penalized.

01:38:32.250 --> 01:38:34.536
You'll get to keep your job too.

01:38:34.875 --> 01:38:38.697
But if you take their
side and get in my way,

01:38:40.208 --> 01:38:42.449
you'll never be called
an attorney ever again.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.161
I don't know what you mean, sir.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.743
Polar bear drank too much coke
so he's not in good health,

01:38:50.833 --> 01:38:53.199
that's why he can't be shown in public.

01:38:53.375 --> 01:38:54.831
Am I right?

01:38:55.958 --> 01:38:56.958
Yes.

01:39:01.417 --> 01:39:03.453
Wait, you can't go in there!

01:39:03.542 --> 01:39:04.622
Boss!

01:39:04.750 --> 01:39:06.240
What are you doing?! Get out!

01:39:06.333 --> 01:39:07.197
Sir! Please!

01:39:07.292 --> 01:39:08.407
Can we talk outside?

01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:09.976
- You're not allowed in here!
- Mr. hwang!

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.615
Stop! Stop!

01:39:12.708 --> 01:39:14.244
Sir, one moment!

01:39:14.333 --> 01:39:14.947
Don't...

01:39:15.042 --> 01:39:16.122
Sir!

01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:19.785
How do you open this?

01:39:21.125 --> 01:39:22.615
- With this?
- Sir...

01:39:49.542 --> 01:39:50.657
Get out!

01:39:51.333 --> 01:39:53.574
Don't do that! It's dangerous.

01:39:53.667 --> 01:39:57.990
You there, go out there
and drink some coke!

01:40:01.208 --> 01:40:03.824
Come on! Pull him off!

01:40:10.458 --> 01:40:11.573
Take Mr. hwang outside!

01:40:11.583 --> 01:40:14.996
It's okay, black nose, it's fine.

01:40:22.375 --> 01:40:23.956
I really don't understand.

01:40:24.250 --> 01:40:27.663
I don't get it, what would he
get out of lying to us?

01:40:29.208 --> 01:40:31.324
Didn't you see me almost get killed?

01:40:32.167 --> 01:40:36.957
Was it a real polar bear? Think carefully.

01:40:37.167 --> 01:40:39.704
To be honest, it was too dark for me.

01:40:42.625 --> 01:40:45.992
It felt real.

01:40:47.542 --> 01:40:49.658
I thought it was the end.

01:40:52.125 --> 01:40:53.831
This can't go on any further.

01:40:55.250 --> 01:40:57.366
We can't put on this charade forever.

01:40:58.500 --> 01:40:59.865
Black nose!

01:41:24.167 --> 01:41:26.954
Hurry up and drink a coke!

01:41:30.792 --> 01:41:32.953
He might get agitated and cause a scene!

01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:35.832
We'll have to send them away! Let's move!

01:41:35.917 --> 01:41:39.159
Black nose! Black nose!

01:41:39.167 --> 01:41:42.910
Why would I lie about that?!
Wait there, I'm coming!

01:41:44.250 --> 01:41:45.740
He said he's coming here.

01:41:45.833 --> 01:41:47.243
What the hell for?!

01:41:47.833 --> 01:41:49.994
Tell him to call us when he has evidence.

01:41:53.208 --> 01:41:55.540
That giraffe is weird...

01:41:56.208 --> 01:41:57.618
What's wrong with it?

01:42:04.167 --> 01:42:05.247
It's fake.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.662
It was a fake? Really?

01:42:10.333 --> 01:42:12.415
- I'm sorry!
- Attention please!

01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:15.492
I'm sorry, we're closing the zoo!

01:42:15.667 --> 01:42:17.203
Please get to the exit!

01:42:17.625 --> 01:42:19.786
Black nose! Over here!

01:42:21.667 --> 01:42:22.827
Black nose!

01:42:25.708 --> 01:42:27.369
- Black nose!
- Black nose!

01:42:27.958 --> 01:42:29.619
- Black nose!
- Black nose!

01:42:30.125 --> 01:42:31.661
Where's the fake polar bear?

01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:34.082
What's with you? You saw
what happened earlier!

01:42:34.958 --> 01:42:35.868
Dammit!

01:42:35.958 --> 01:42:38.119
- Mr. hwang! Sir!
- Are you nuts?!

01:42:38.208 --> 01:42:39.618
That's a real polar bear!

01:42:39.708 --> 01:42:41.323
Go get the tranquilizer! Buddy!

01:42:41.417 --> 01:42:43.282
Take it off before I beat you!

01:42:43.375 --> 01:42:44.990
Sir! He's a real polar bear!

01:42:45.083 --> 01:42:46.948
You must be going nuts, right?

01:42:47.792 --> 01:42:50.078
I can hear your head spin!

01:42:50.167 --> 01:42:51.828
Sir! Get back in here!

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.207
Sir! Please come back just in case!

01:42:54.292 --> 01:42:56.749
- It's really convincing.
- Please come back!

01:43:00.875 --> 01:43:03.708
Sir! Play dead!

01:43:04.250 --> 01:43:05.740
Black nose!

01:43:06.208 --> 01:43:08.574
You're doing well, sir!

01:43:08.708 --> 01:43:10.664
- Do something!
- Black nose!

01:43:11.875 --> 01:43:15.163
I'm doing a Google search, sir!

01:43:15.708 --> 01:43:17.118
Black nose!

01:43:18.083 --> 01:43:18.697
Dr. han.

01:43:18.792 --> 01:43:21.499
There are a lot of different species...

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:24.991
What are you doing?

01:43:25.625 --> 01:43:27.991
Black nose gets excited
when he sees this suit.

01:43:28.417 --> 01:43:30.703
I'll lure him away, so grab Mr. hwang.

01:43:30.792 --> 01:43:33.454
You're going in like this? Are you nuts?

01:43:33.542 --> 01:43:34.952
We have to save him first.

01:43:35.708 --> 01:43:40.953
Sir! It says playing dead is a myth!

01:43:41.083 --> 01:43:44.621
Ow! It hurts, you dumb bear!

01:43:44.708 --> 01:43:48.155
It says if you meet a bear
in the forest, climb up a tree!

01:43:48.250 --> 01:43:50.241
There aren't any trees here!

01:43:50.333 --> 01:43:52.039
Speak some sense!

01:44:03.542 --> 01:44:05.578
Black nose! Over here!

01:44:06.250 --> 01:44:07.080
Hurry up!

01:44:07.167 --> 01:44:08.167
Sir!

01:44:09.708 --> 01:44:11.323
Now's the time! Hurry!

01:44:11.417 --> 01:44:12.497
Let's go!

01:44:13.333 --> 01:44:14.539
Black nose!

01:44:15.750 --> 01:44:17.786
We did it! Get in here!

01:44:50.542 --> 01:44:51.827
Black nose!

01:44:52.708 --> 01:44:53.993
Hurry!

01:45:16.542 --> 01:45:19.989
I promised you that I'd save the zoo...

01:45:28.667 --> 01:45:30.203
I'm so sorry...

01:45:33.042 --> 01:45:36.239
I'll take full responsibility
so no harm is done to you.

01:45:36.792 --> 01:45:40.364
I did it because I wanted to,
not because I trusted you.

01:45:41.833 --> 01:45:43.198
He's right.

01:45:44.625 --> 01:45:46.786
It was a failed zoo,

01:45:48.083 --> 01:45:52.201
I have no regrets since we gave it all.

01:45:54.042 --> 01:45:55.782
I ruined everything.

01:45:56.375 --> 01:46:00.618
This isn't all on you,
we were on this together.

01:46:09.125 --> 01:46:12.538
Come on, don't cry now.

01:46:13.333 --> 01:46:16.370
We know how hard you worked.

01:46:17.375 --> 01:46:21.698
I just wish we could do something
about remaining animals.

01:46:26.458 --> 01:46:28.039
I have a great idea.

01:46:28.208 --> 01:46:29.448
I oppose.

01:46:29.542 --> 01:46:31.328
Just stop it, director.

01:46:31.625 --> 01:46:33.331
There is a way to save the zoo!

01:46:33.417 --> 01:46:36.784
Let's stop, this is all very exhausting.

01:46:36.875 --> 01:46:40.367
He can't let this
heart-moving moment last a minute.

01:46:41.125 --> 01:46:42.831
Please, just trust me!

01:46:42.917 --> 01:46:45.203
I'll take full responsibility
to bring back our zoo!

01:46:46.208 --> 01:46:48.824
Are you asking me to run a zoo?

01:46:49.833 --> 01:46:51.494
It's not just a zoo.

01:46:51.583 --> 01:46:54.620
I'm asking you to provide
an ecological park

01:46:54.708 --> 01:46:58.872
within the proposed resort
for our animals to live in.

01:46:59.542 --> 01:47:03.990
Only then, will we sell
the zoo property to you.

01:47:04.625 --> 01:47:08.447
Wait, the landowner is Gabriel.

01:47:08.542 --> 01:47:11.784
Gabriel must concede, I'll get it done.

01:47:12.667 --> 01:47:18.412
Rakwon's getting pummeled
by the public for demolishing environment.

01:47:19.208 --> 01:47:22.166
If you create an eco
park within the resort,

01:47:22.375 --> 01:47:24.787
it becomes 'environment-friendly'.

01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:29.832
An environment-friendly resort?

01:47:32.667 --> 01:47:33.747
That's good.

01:47:34.667 --> 01:47:37.079
If Gabriel agrees, I'll do it.

01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:49.822
The Gabriel transaction records
that I was in charge of.

01:47:50.667 --> 01:47:52.203
Okay, this is enough.

01:47:58.917 --> 01:48:01.033
Come on, I'll keep it anonymous.

01:48:01.792 --> 01:48:04.864
It's too obvious who the source is.

01:48:05.208 --> 01:48:06.823
Just deny it.

01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:09.616
Why should I give these to you?

01:48:10.375 --> 01:48:11.831
Because we're friends.

01:48:11.917 --> 01:48:14.078
You said you don't need friends.

01:48:15.958 --> 01:48:18.119
How can one live without
friends in this world?

01:48:18.625 --> 01:48:20.240
It's not a solitary life.

01:48:22.625 --> 01:48:24.161
I love you, friend.

01:48:24.500 --> 01:48:28.448
If we don't respond in 24 hours,
he'll send it to the prosecutors.

01:48:29.542 --> 01:48:30.998
Kang said...

01:48:31.917 --> 01:48:34.499
This is not a deal.

01:48:36.250 --> 01:48:38.115
Do what he wants.

01:48:39.333 --> 01:48:40.618
Find the leaker.

01:48:45.542 --> 01:48:46.702
Mr. song.

01:48:47.667 --> 01:48:50.204
Please take good care of him.

01:48:50.333 --> 01:48:55.532
Environment and animal protection
associations are starting a petition,

01:48:55.625 --> 01:48:58.537
and our law school friends
are helping out as well,

01:48:58.750 --> 01:49:01.366
he likely won't get a prison sentence.

01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:06.073
I heard he could be disbarred even
if he receives probation.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:10.743
We'll get through the investigation
and worry about that...

01:49:12.958 --> 01:49:16.655
I'm the one in trouble! Mel!

01:49:18.458 --> 01:49:19.914
I'm sorry, bud.

01:49:20.792 --> 01:49:23.625
All right, let's go.

01:49:42.625 --> 01:49:44.240
Not as many as I thought.

01:49:44.333 --> 01:49:45.698
So you feel bad?

01:49:45.792 --> 01:49:49.489
- There they are!
- He's here!

01:49:49.875 --> 01:49:51.786
Don't frown, look remorseful.

01:49:52.458 --> 01:49:54.289
Are you in any way associated with jh?

01:49:54.375 --> 01:49:55.809
- How much were the suits?
- Pardon me.

01:49:55.833 --> 01:49:57.073
Excuse me.

01:49:57.542 --> 01:49:59.143
- Move aside, please.
- Who made the suits?

01:49:59.167 --> 01:50:00.893
- I'll cooperate fully to the investigation.
- One comment please!

01:50:00.917 --> 01:50:03.750
Whose idea was it to have
the polar bear drink coke?!

01:50:04.083 --> 01:50:05.744
I'll cooperate fully.

01:50:06.208 --> 01:50:09.120
Why wasn't the giraffe suit finished?!

01:50:12.458 --> 01:50:14.574
"1 year later"

01:50:37.208 --> 01:50:38.789
"African park eurasian park"

01:50:38.792 --> 01:50:40.282
"rakwon ecological zoo oceanian park"

01:50:40.458 --> 01:50:42.744
"rakwon shopping mall

01:50:43.667 --> 01:50:46.704
"environment and humans co-exist"

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.742
"at rakwon ecological zoo resort"

01:50:56.917 --> 01:50:59.784
I've been dreaming this for a long time,

01:51:00.958 --> 01:51:05.622
this ecological zoo that will be
built in dongsan city,

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:09.163
is not a zoo for people to observe animals,

01:51:09.333 --> 01:51:11.915
but a park that is without
cement and cages,

01:51:12.250 --> 01:51:14.866
a park that is closest to the wilderness,

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:20.620
it'll be the biggest
ecological zoo in Asia.

01:51:21.583 --> 01:51:24.575
Like she was ever interested in zoos.

01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:28.866
We're rakwon employees now.

01:51:30.292 --> 01:51:31.623
Director.

01:51:31.750 --> 01:51:34.537
What happened to the polar bear?

01:51:34.958 --> 01:51:36.573
- The polar bear?
- Yeah.

01:51:37.167 --> 01:51:38.532
He's gone.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.206
What? Why?

01:51:40.583 --> 01:51:43.074
He immigrated, to a cold country.

01:51:43.833 --> 01:51:45.073
Immigrated?

01:51:46.792 --> 01:51:50.114
"Canadian polar bear habitat"

01:52:17.958 --> 01:52:20.665
- Is he one of them?
- No...

01:52:24.958 --> 01:52:26.368
They all look the same...

01:52:34.458 --> 01:52:38.451
Excuse me, are you Koreans by any chance?

01:52:38.625 --> 01:52:39.865
Yes, we are.

01:52:40.667 --> 01:52:43.704
I was right, he's that fake zoo director.

01:52:43.917 --> 01:52:45.077
Are you?

01:52:45.958 --> 01:52:46.958
Yes.

01:52:47.500 --> 01:52:49.786
You're famous even among
Korean residents here.

01:52:49.917 --> 01:52:50.622
I am?

01:52:50.708 --> 01:52:53.370
You were released so early?

01:52:53.667 --> 01:52:55.248
It wasn't a prison sentence.

01:52:56.292 --> 01:52:57.702
I got probation

01:52:58.417 --> 01:53:00.078
and 400 hours of community service.

01:53:00.167 --> 01:53:04.240
If it's okay, could we
take a photo together?

01:53:07.375 --> 01:53:08.490
Here.

01:53:08.625 --> 01:53:10.081
Please?

01:53:11.792 --> 01:53:14.158
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

01:53:17.917 --> 01:53:19.407
- Here we go.
- Okay.

01:53:19.542 --> 01:53:20.827
1, 2

01:53:23.917 --> 01:53:27.080
- thank you!
- Thank you!

01:53:32.667 --> 01:53:34.373
Don't post it online!

01:53:36.417 --> 01:53:38.578
You're an international star.

01:53:40.417 --> 01:53:41.623
Damn...

01:53:53.458 --> 01:53:54.868
Black nose...
