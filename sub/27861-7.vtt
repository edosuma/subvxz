What are you doing here?

01:55.085 --> 01:58.685
-I-- I wanted to see you.
-Whatever for?

01:59.885 --> 02:01.885
I thought we could still be friends.

02:03.205 --> 02:04.845
My uncle has forbidden it.

02:04.925 --> 02:07.845
-I know, but I thought--
-Thought what?

02:08.085 --> 02:11.125
That you would ignore his wishes?
My uncle was right.

02:11.325 --> 02:14.204
-You Medici are pushy!
-Stop it, Francesco.

02:15.365 --> 02:17.245
-I said stop!
-Or what?

02:17.325 --> 02:20.005
You're gonna send your crippled father
limping after me?

02:22.405 --> 02:23.725
[both grunting]

02:31.085 --> 02:33.525
Take it back. Take it back.

02:38.245 --> 02:40.085
You think the Pazzi
are plotting against you?

02:42.125 --> 02:45.485
Why else would Francesco be in Rome
having meetings with Salviati?

02:46.005 --> 02:48.045
Could there not be innocent reasons
for them to meet?

02:48.165 --> 02:51.605
At night? In secret? No.

02:52.925 --> 02:55.085
[horses trotting]

03:02.445 --> 03:04.045
[horse neighing]

03:12.725 --> 03:14.725
Thank you for coming, Messer Montesecco.

03:15.205 --> 03:16.725
Well, I couldn't help be curious.

03:17.525 --> 03:20.725
What would an archbishop and a banker
want with a soldier?

04:04.885 --> 04:06.965
I find you more prepared
than Galeazzo Sforza was.

04:08.445 --> 04:12.485
I can't put up with these armed guards
breathing down my neck.

04:13.285 --> 04:14.765
It makes me look weak.

04:16.805 --> 04:18.925
I have to return to Rome,
speak with the Pope.

04:19.365 --> 04:22.045
No, you're not safe in Rome.
It's too unstable.

04:22.404 --> 04:25.284
Sforza was a brute,
but he was a strong man.

04:25.485 --> 04:27.965
While he ruled Milan, the alliance
might have offered some protection.

04:28.045 --> 04:30.325
Now, your alliance
is with a seven-year-old boy.

04:30.405 --> 04:33.965
He has a mother acting as his regent.
He has... uncles.

04:34.045 --> 04:38.125
[scoffs] Yes, many uncles.
Many men, many rivals.

04:38.965 --> 04:41.845
No doubt maneuvering for position
like men always do.

04:42.485 --> 04:44.885
And Venice will be
in the same state of uncertainty

04:44.965 --> 04:46.365
wondering how Sforza's death
has changed things.

04:46.445 --> 04:48.485
The alliance will hold, Mother.

04:49.045 --> 04:50.365
The cities will honor it.

04:51.045 --> 04:53.005
Cut six inches off a leg.

04:53.725 --> 04:57.165
Stool is still a stool, yes?
But would you sit on it?

05:28.365 --> 05:29.445
[door closes]

05:34.005 --> 05:35.605
[door creaking]

05:37.805 --> 05:40.285
Lorenzo is in league
with Milan and Venice.

05:40.965 --> 05:43.805
And he means to move against
the papal states.

05:44.445 --> 05:45.725
You want me to raise an army?

05:47.405 --> 05:51.365
No. It's not a military question.

05:53.685 --> 05:55.565
Then how do you propose to stop him?

05:56.725 --> 06:00.285
[Francesco] He and his brother
have to die simultaneously.

06:04.485 --> 06:06.445
[Montesecco] Well, because if one of them
is left alive,

06:06.525 --> 06:08.325
he'll rally his city behind him.

06:09.445 --> 06:10.525
Avenge the other.

06:10.885 --> 06:13.765
[Francesco] Florence will celebrate
the day the Medici are gone.

06:15.645 --> 06:18.005
And my uncle becomes their new ruler.

06:18.085 --> 06:21.245
We are not acting alone.
We have many supporters.

06:22.965 --> 06:24.405
So why do you need me?

06:26.605 --> 06:27.885
What's the plan?

06:28.645 --> 06:31.885
[Montesecco] Lorenzo will be invited to
Rome to celebrate Easter with the Pope.

06:32.565 --> 06:37.125
While he is here, I'll be in Florence
taking care of Giuliano.

06:42.165 --> 06:44.165
And you want me to kill Lorenzo?

06:53.205 --> 06:55.325
Snuff him out like a candle?

07:23.365 --> 07:24.245
[grunts]

07:39.405 --> 07:40.765
[pants]

07:50.485 --> 07:52.685
-[panting]
-What is it?

07:53.645 --> 07:55.925
A trap for Lorenzo.

07:56.405 --> 07:59.245
They'll lure him here.
Count Montesecco will kill him

07:59.325 --> 08:01.765
while the Pazzi kill Giuliano in Florence.

08:02.725 --> 08:04.165
[footsteps approaching]

08:13.045 --> 08:15.805
-Sorry to disturb you, Father.
-Well, it's all right.

08:15.885 --> 08:19.245
Well, someone's just tried to kill
Archbishop Salviati.

08:19.965 --> 08:20.885
Kill?

08:23.285 --> 08:25.365
You haven't seen a man
with a knife in here?

08:26.965 --> 08:28.885
[chuckles] No.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.405
You're sure?

09:01.365 --> 09:02.685
Yes.

09:34.965 --> 09:37.085
Perhaps you were too engrossed
in your studies.

09:40.245 --> 09:44.005
But, but he hasn't got a knife
and he wouldn't kill anyone. I know him.

09:44.085 --> 09:45.085
So I see.

09:45.765 --> 09:47.845
You are not allowed
to carry weapons in Rome.

09:48.125 --> 09:49.605
[grunts]

09:52.885 --> 09:54.245
[flesh tearing]

10:06.285 --> 10:07.245
Oh, look.

10:08.885 --> 10:10.205
A murderer with a knife.

10:16.085 --> 10:18.245
But what are we going to do
about his accomplice?

10:24.845 --> 10:26.605
[whimpers]

10:39.885 --> 10:43.045
They are very good, Sandro.
Very good.

10:51.205 --> 10:52.445
Come on, then, why are we here?

10:52.525 --> 10:55.565
I've been invited for talks
with the Pope over Easter.

10:56.605 --> 10:59.525
Might be a trap,
might be a genuine olive branch.

10:59.925 --> 11:01.325
What does Carlo say?

11:03.325 --> 11:04.645
Well, I'm waiting to hear.

11:06.405 --> 11:09.565
I've been thinking that you two
could go off for a diplomatic overture.

11:09.645 --> 11:11.885
Offer the services
of the world's greatest artist

11:11.965 --> 11:13.165
to the Holy Father. What do you say?

11:13.605 --> 11:15.285
I will never paint again.

11:15.805 --> 11:17.805
-My muse is dead.
-[Giuliano scoffs]

11:18.445 --> 11:20.725
You think it's funny?
It's your fault.

11:22.725 --> 11:26.485
-[sighs] It's all her husband's fault.
-She died of the wasting disease.

11:26.565 --> 11:28.645
Because he couldn't resist
another man's wife.

11:28.725 --> 11:32.045
Whilst you made love to her
with your paint brush.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.285
And you killed her.

11:33.565 --> 11:36.565
-You and your lust and her idiot husband--
-Your loss, moping about your muse.

11:36.645 --> 11:37.925
-You're just jealous!
-You killed her!

11:38.005 --> 11:39.245
Stop it, stop it.

11:42.685 --> 11:43.885
Let's console ourselves.

11:43.965 --> 11:46.205
At least she lives on in,
in Sandro's paintings.

11:49.165 --> 11:53.445
These, these daubs, these insignificant

11:53.525 --> 11:56.565
little daubs, they are not even close.

11:58.765 --> 12:00.765
They are not even close. They're...

12:01.205 --> 12:04.725
-No closer... than this.
-Giuliano.

12:05.245 --> 12:09.605
Or this, or this, or this,
or this, or this, or this, or this!

12:09.685 --> 12:14.765
Anyone, anyone can daub pigment on a panel
and pretend that it means something.

12:14.845 --> 12:16.045
It means nothing!

12:23.685 --> 12:26.685
She was just an object to you.

12:28.285 --> 12:30.285
To me, she was everything.

12:30.925 --> 12:32.885
She made life mean something.

12:45.165 --> 12:47.565
He's hurting and he's lashing out, Sandro.

12:49.925 --> 12:51.165
You pay him no heed.

12:55.085 --> 12:57.845
You need to find another way
to make your peace with Rome.

13:02.005 --> 13:03.365
[horses trotting]

13:14.005 --> 13:16.285
Fetch Montesecco and Francesco Pazzi.

13:16.365 --> 13:19.005
Tell them our guest from Florence
has arrived.

13:23.525 --> 13:27.605
Ah, Cardinal Orsini, I was looking for
Lorenzo de' Medici.

13:27.965 --> 13:31.765
-I saw his carriage outside.
-He's in Florence, Your Grace.

13:33.125 --> 13:36.605
His carriage brought my niece to Rome
as you can see.

13:37.645 --> 13:40.325
His Holiness will be disappointed.

13:40.765 --> 13:43.645
Lorenzo has had to decline
the Holy Father's kind invitation

13:43.725 --> 13:45.365
due to a prior engagement.

13:45.445 --> 13:48.085
He is hosting eminent visitors
from Venice and Milan.

13:48.405 --> 13:51.205
You must see that this trip and alliance
of his is an act of provocation.

13:51.285 --> 13:52.845
-It's not meant to be.
-He should be here.

13:55.245 --> 13:56.525
What's he afraid of?

14:00.125 --> 14:01.605
If Lorenzo had anything to fear in Rome,

14:01.685 --> 14:03.365
he wouldn't allow his wife
to be here, would he?

14:04.565 --> 14:07.525
[Cardinal Orsini] My niece's presence
is a sign of good faith.

14:11.125 --> 14:14.485
I bring a message, a letter
confirming that Lorenzo supports

14:14.565 --> 14:16.525
all discussions aimed at re-establishing

14:16.605 --> 14:18.725
friendly relations
between Rome and Florence.

14:19.525 --> 14:23.765
And authorizing his uncle, Father Carlo,
to represent him in all such negotiations.

14:30.285 --> 14:31.925
Now, do you know where I might find
Father Carlo?

14:33.565 --> 14:34.805
He isn't in his apartments.

14:34.885 --> 14:36.485
And he hasn't been seen in the library
for sometime.

14:36.565 --> 14:40.045
I was told he's on a retreat for Lent.

14:41.285 --> 14:43.405
He made no mention of that
in his last letter.

14:44.045 --> 14:46.125
Perhaps it was a spur of the moment
decision.

14:46.205 --> 14:48.525
He'll have to return
before the peace talks can begin.

14:49.045 --> 14:50.565
And I can't leave until I've seen him.

14:55.885 --> 14:57.485
Did he suspect a trap?

14:58.525 --> 15:00.045
Would he send his wife if he did?

15:00.725 --> 15:04.245
-He's no coward.
-It's a calculated risk.

15:04.725 --> 15:07.565
She's a Medici and an Orsini.
He believes no one would harm her.

15:08.165 --> 15:10.365
It will lose them support
in Florence and Rome.

15:10.445 --> 15:12.445
What kind of a man would put
so much trust in his wife?

15:12.525 --> 15:13.605
We can't shut her up.

15:16.725 --> 15:18.925
But we can't let her tell Lorenzo

15:19.005 --> 15:22.485
his bastard priest half-uncle
has vanished.

15:23.085 --> 15:24.805
And she won't leave
until she's spoken to him.
And Easter's only days away.

15:26.685 --> 15:28.165
We need a change of plan.

15:31.485 --> 15:34.725
They both have to die in Florence.
-[Francesco] It will be much riskier.

15:35.365 --> 15:37.205
It's not just a double murder.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.925
-It's a coup.
-And we'll need an army.

15:40.245 --> 15:43.725
In case the people rebel, one big enough
to make Venice and Milan

15:43.805 --> 15:46.045
think twice about coming
to their assistance.

15:46.485 --> 15:48.285
It'll have to be paid for.

15:48.725 --> 15:52.045
I'll need to get my men inside
the city walls without raising suspicion.

15:52.485 --> 15:55.005
-Can you do that?
-With the Pope's backing.

15:56.205 --> 15:58.685
But I want proof that he supports us.

16:00.325 --> 16:01.485
You'll get it.

16:02.565 --> 16:04.405
[choir singing]

16:24.965 --> 16:27.845
-[bells tolling]
-[indistinct chatter]

16:33.725 --> 16:36.805
I don't like the idea of a foreign army
in the city.

16:37.365 --> 16:38.485
[Francesco] It's just a precaution.

16:39.005 --> 16:41.685
In case Lorenzo's alliance
is more of a threat than it looks.

16:42.685 --> 16:44.645
Make Salviati come with him.

16:45.725 --> 16:48.805
People need to know our uprising
is led by men of Florence.

16:51.445 --> 16:52.765
[cow mooing]

16:55.365 --> 16:57.725
[clears throat] Gentlemen.

16:58.325 --> 17:01.645
Our honored guest, young Galeazzo Sforza,
the duke of Milan.

17:02.285 --> 17:03.445
Your Excellency.

17:03.685 --> 17:06.485
His mother, the regent,
the Dutchess<i> Bona di Savoia.</i>

17:07.045 --> 17:08.245
Honored guests indeed.

17:08.325 --> 17:12.084
I hear Messer Medici snubbed
a personal invitation from the Pope

17:12.205 --> 17:13.445
to be with you today.

17:13.604 --> 17:17.645
-No snub was intended.
-I do hope you don't live to regret it.

17:22.045 --> 17:25.765
Now, has anyone explained the origins
of our Easter ceremony to you?

17:26.725 --> 17:29.685
During the first crusades
to the holy land,

17:29.844 --> 17:34.925
our noble ancestor, Pazzino de' Pazzi
claimed Palestine for Christianity

17:35.365 --> 17:38.725
by being the very first man
to scale the walls of Jerusalem.

17:39.165 --> 17:43.005
As a reward, he was given three
small stones from the tomb of Christ.

17:43.325 --> 17:47.205
And every year since,
those three flints have created the spark

17:47.365 --> 17:48.965
that lights our Easter candle.

17:49.325 --> 17:51.605
One might say we are the oldest

17:51.685 --> 17:55.325
most noble family
in Florence.

17:55.525 --> 17:58.765
One might.
If you didn't always beat one to it.

18:00.205 --> 18:01.565
Your Excellency.

18:14.885 --> 18:15.925
[mouse squeaking]

18:22.565 --> 18:24.285
[chains rattling]

18:37.205 --> 18:41.285
[Montesecco] There you are.
Crusted bread for your Easter supper.

18:48.885 --> 18:50.645
Men of faith don't fear death.

18:53.445 --> 18:55.245
You would happily sacrifice your life

18:55.325 --> 18:57.885
to save Lorenzo and Giuliano de' Medici,
am I right?

19:02.285 --> 19:03.565
I'm right.

19:04.045 --> 19:06.805
But what would you do
to save Lorenzo's wife,

19:06.885 --> 19:08.485
your good friend Clarice?

19:11.205 --> 19:14.725
-You wouldn't dare.
-I would rather not.

19:15.605 --> 19:18.605
But she's here in Rome
demanding to see you now.

19:18.685 --> 19:21.645
If I was to let you speak to her

19:21.725 --> 19:24.445
and you were to tell her what you know,
she would have to die.

19:27.485 --> 19:31.525
But I have strict personal rules.

19:41.365 --> 19:42.925
I don't kill women.

19:44.965 --> 19:49.965
I'd have to leave her to my men,
a fate considerably worse than death.

19:54.645 --> 19:56.125
And if I don't tell her?

19:58.565 --> 20:00.125
5Then we'll have no reason to kill her.

20:02.205 --> 20:03.725
Do I have your word on that?

20:06.045 --> 20:09.405
Put her mind to rest and she will live.

20:10.125 --> 20:11.885
66It's the only choice you have.

20:27.045 --> 20:28.685
A beautiful ceremony, Your Holiness.

20:29.285 --> 20:31.805
Your young nephew
will make an excellent cardinal.

20:33.245 --> 20:36.045
Get to your point.
You have five minutes.

20:38.565 --> 20:40.925
It's about Lorenzo de' Medici.

20:41.485 --> 20:43.245
We'd like to propose a solution.

20:44.325 --> 20:45.965
You know Count Montesecco.

20:46.485 --> 20:47.485
[Sixtus] I do.

20:47.925 --> 20:50.965
He can help us solve the Lorenzo problem.

21:00.845 --> 21:02.525
I will not condone a murder.

21:02.965 --> 21:06.365
Of course, not. You might say
he's here as my bodyguard.

21:07.125 --> 21:09.325
Some nights ago, a man tried to kill me.

21:09.605 --> 21:13.245
The count was one of several witnesses
to see the assassin flee the scene.

21:13.725 --> 21:15.845
He gave chase, pursued him to a library.

21:15.965 --> 21:18.445
Where I found him reporting
to Father Carlo de' Medici.

21:20.205 --> 21:21.205
Why would he?

21:22.285 --> 21:26.245
You ordained me as archbishop of Pisa.

21:27.125 --> 21:28.845
Lorenzo wanted his own man.

21:29.365 --> 21:32.445
The Medici are cutthroat merchants

21:32.525 --> 21:36.725
who use violence to remove
those they can't manipulate.

21:37.165 --> 21:39.725
The new duke of Milan
is a seven-year-old boy.

21:39.845 --> 21:42.565
Lorenzo wants complete control
of Florence,

21:43.285 --> 21:45.285
Milan and Venice,

21:45.365 --> 21:48.085
and then his sights
will be on the Holy Sea itself.

21:49.085 --> 21:50.885
He is going to poison you.

21:53.965 --> 21:55.445
We need to act first.

22:11.445 --> 22:13.485
I will not condone murder.

22:14.125 --> 22:15.285
Of course not.

22:17.205 --> 22:20.525
We invited him to Rome
to discuss reconciliation,

22:21.845 --> 22:23.925
but we won't take that as an insult.

22:25.325 --> 22:26.925
If he won't come to us,

22:27.805 --> 22:29.805
we swallow our pride

22:30.445 --> 22:33.885
and we go to him,
send the papal emissary.

22:34.485 --> 22:35.925
Who do you suggest?

22:36.325 --> 22:38.165
Your newest cardinal, Raffaele.

22:38.565 --> 22:40.045
As he is your beloved nephew,

22:40.165 --> 22:43.485
it'll prove your personal commitment
to finding a peaceful solution.

22:43.565 --> 22:46.445
Are you out of your mind? He's 17.

22:46.805 --> 22:50.085
He'll need a bodyguard
and a large retinue.

22:50.165 --> 22:54.165
A retinue befitting his status
and the importance of his peace mission

22:54.245 --> 22:56.725
and prepared for any eventuality.

22:56.845 --> 22:58.445
The Medici will not go without a fight.

22:58.725 --> 23:01.725
They will try to draw their allies
from Venice and Milan into it.

23:02.725 --> 23:06.605
We'll need at least 600 fully armed men,
Your Holiness.

23:07.765 --> 23:11.245
Are you willing to approve the funding
for such a large retinue?

23:25.725 --> 23:28.965
Did your, uh, diplomatic overture

23:29.045 --> 23:32.005
with the seven-year-old duke
and his mother work?

23:33.165 --> 23:36.725
Our treaty with Venice and Milan
will compel the Pope to negotiate.

23:37.765 --> 23:41.885
Violence only ever begets violence,
but words...

23:43.485 --> 23:44.845
words beget dialog.

23:45.365 --> 23:50.125
Ninety-nine good apples
turn a bad one sweet.

23:53.005 --> 23:54.845
You know, all this cynicism,

23:56.205 --> 23:58.885
-it's gonna destroy you, brother.
-You think...

24:01.525 --> 24:03.965
[heavy breathing]

24:14.445 --> 24:16.205
...that it's all meaningless.

24:18.645 --> 24:24.005
And the only way to thrive
in the real world, world of sin...

24:26.725 --> 24:27.925
is to do what Cosimo did.

24:31.405 --> 24:35.125
And be a more ruthless sinner
than your enemy.

24:51.965 --> 24:54.205
[birds chirping]

25:00.285 --> 25:01.365
Carlo.

25:06.045 --> 25:09.485
I thought you were dead.
Where have you been?

25:10.085 --> 25:12.725
I just... At a monastery, fasting.

25:13.925 --> 25:16.165
Why didn't you tell us?
We've been so worried.

25:17.965 --> 25:19.085
I'm sorry.

25:21.285 --> 25:23.325
[Clarice] Lorenzo's been waiting
to hear from you.

25:25.885 --> 25:27.245
He needs to know.

25:28.645 --> 25:31.005
Are the Pope's desires
for reconciliation genuine?

25:34.845 --> 25:36.845
It is, yes. It is.

25:39.285 --> 25:42.085
He's sending Cardinal Riario
to Florence on a diplomatic mission,

25:42.165 --> 25:45.765
Lorenzo should make...
him and his retinue welcome.

25:59.365 --> 26:01.805
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure.

26:02.885 --> 26:05.605
Now, you need to go.
I have some work to do. [clears throat]

26:07.165 --> 26:11.205
-Something wrong?
-You need to go.

26:11.805 --> 26:13.645
I'll come with Cardinal Riario to Florence

26:13.725 --> 26:17.925
and we can speak at great length
then, all right?

26:27.165 --> 26:30.165
-You promise?
-Promise. I'm OK. Please.

26:34.245 --> 26:38.085
-Bye, Clarice.
-All right. Goodbye.

27:02.365 --> 27:03.685
Don't cry.

27:05.045 --> 27:06.445
You just saved her life.

27:09.845 --> 27:12.765
She'll be expecting me to travel
with the cardinal now, may I?

27:17.325 --> 27:21.085
The Pope has authorized
our bank to fund an army

27:21.765 --> 27:24.005
to be led from Imola by Count Riario.

27:24.405 --> 27:27.285
You try to enter Florence
and there'll be a blood bath.

27:27.365 --> 27:28.365
[horse neighing]

27:28.445 --> 27:31.005
[Jacopo]<i> Montesecco will lead</i>
<i>a vanguard of 50 men.</i>

27:31.365 --> 27:33.685
[Francesco]<i> Lorenzo thinks</i>
<i>they're coming for peace talks.</i>

27:34.045 --> 27:36.485
They'll be disguised as the retinue
of the Pope's nephew,

27:37.205 --> 27:39.165
Cardinal Raffaele Riario.

27:39.845 --> 27:42.405
There will be a banquet
to welcome the cardinal,

27:43.965 --> 27:46.965
but the Medici brothers will not make it
past the first course.

27:48.325 --> 27:53.445
When they are dead, the government palace
will be seized on behalf of the people.

27:53.525 --> 27:57.445
And my uncle will be proclaimed
the new leader of Florence.

27:57.765 --> 27:59.725
Soon after, my men will enter the city,

27:59.845 --> 28:02.765
ready to defend the uprising
against any opposition.

28:04.085 --> 28:05.685
And the Pope has agreed to this?

28:06.045 --> 28:09.325
He wants rid of the Medici tyrants
just as much as we do.

28:28.285 --> 28:29.765
You look worried, Uncle.

28:32.445 --> 28:34.365
Not having second thoughts, are you?

28:34.485 --> 28:37.845
-Don't call His Holiness, "Uncle".
-Sorry.

28:39.605 --> 28:42.365
Please don't worry, Your Holiness.

28:42.445 --> 28:47.725
I will make the Medici abide by your will,
and peace will prevail. I, I promise.

28:47.805 --> 28:50.165
Time to go.
God's work to do.

28:51.125 --> 28:55.245
I can hardly believe you're entrusting me
with such an important mission.

29:17.605 --> 29:18.645
[horses neighing]

29:34.245 --> 29:35.405
[Jacopo] Count.

29:36.245 --> 29:37.765
By the time I return with my men,

29:37.845 --> 29:39.965
you will be the new ruler
of this republic.

29:53.965 --> 29:55.365
Should we warn Guglielmo?

29:56.285 --> 30:01.205
Or find some excuse to keep him
and his wife away from the banquet?

30:05.725 --> 30:07.125
We cannot trust him.

30:21.445 --> 30:22.885
[indistinct chatter]

30:37.965 --> 30:40.845
[Lorenzo] The Pope loves Raffaele Riario
like a son.

30:40.925 --> 30:43.845
-He's very young.
-He won't come alone. He'll have advisers.

30:45.405 --> 30:48.405
Perhaps the Holy Father wants to give him
a chance to prove himself.

30:51.685 --> 30:55.085
Like you, sending me off to Rome.

30:56.285 --> 30:58.605
I didn't send you off to Rome,
you sent yourself.

31:02.325 --> 31:03.885
I knew that I could trust you.

31:12.405 --> 31:13.405
Carlo...

31:14.885 --> 31:16.205
something was troubling him.

31:18.245 --> 31:19.445
About the visit?

31:20.605 --> 31:21.725
I don't know.

31:23.085 --> 31:24.805
We can ask him when they get here.

32:21.485 --> 32:22.565
Ah.

32:24.005 --> 32:25.885
Rather more than I expected.

32:26.685 --> 32:28.725
You're most welcome, Your Eminence.

32:28.885 --> 32:31.285
Though some of your retinue
may have to sleep in the stables.

32:31.565 --> 32:34.445
Well, if it was good enough for our Lord.

32:36.965 --> 32:38.205
Your Eminence.

32:39.245 --> 32:40.165
Welcome.

32:43.045 --> 32:44.925
I must say this is a surprise.

32:45.365 --> 32:47.285
We were only expecting Cardinal Riario.

32:49.085 --> 32:51.325
I'm afraid I flattered myself

32:51.405 --> 32:54.085
that I might have a role to play
in bringing the two sides together.

32:55.565 --> 32:56.885
Is Father Carlo not with you?

32:58.845 --> 33:00.485
His Holiness
had another assignment for him.

33:01.445 --> 33:03.165
Father Carlo sends his apologies.

33:07.045 --> 33:09.045
My wife will show you to your quarters.

33:09.405 --> 33:12.125
-Tonight we dine in your honor.
-I look forward to it.

33:12.725 --> 33:14.805
And I appreciate your hospitality.

33:15.565 --> 33:16.645
Do come this way.

33:35.365 --> 33:36.925
Here is your ruffian, Ma donna.

33:40.205 --> 33:41.245
Lorenzo.

33:44.485 --> 33:49.405
In future, you'll see to it he keeps away
from this family and this house.

33:50.325 --> 33:51.605
What were you thinking?

33:51.725 --> 33:53.565
I just wanted to be friends, Grandmother.

33:53.645 --> 33:55.845
He strikes my nephew
and calls it friendship.

33:57.485 --> 33:58.805
You were not wrong to try.

33:59.485 --> 34:02.685
You still must try to extend
a hand of friendship,

34:02.765 --> 34:04.285
even if it is not returned.

34:07.285 --> 34:08.325
Come.

34:13.845 --> 34:14.805
Oh.

34:21.405 --> 34:22.244
Grandmother.

34:27.605 --> 34:28.965
[faint voice] Ma donna?

34:48.845 --> 34:50.204
[Sandro] You asked to see me.

34:52.005 --> 34:53.085
Yes.

34:53.565 --> 34:55.605
I want you to come to the banquet.

34:57.045 --> 35:00.005
If you think you can exploit my art
to curry favors with your enemies,

35:00.085 --> 35:02.085
-you have another thing coming.
-Oh, no. Don't worry.

35:02.645 --> 35:07.245
I'm offering the Curia commission to a,
a young fellow from Verrocchio's workshop,

35:07.325 --> 35:08.365
Leonardo.

35:09.325 --> 35:11.165
Everyone's talking about him apparently.

35:11.525 --> 35:14.005
I hear he has some ability,
may do you a half decent job,

35:14.085 --> 35:15.205
but I hear he doesn't finish anything.

35:15.285 --> 35:17.085
Oh, no, I don't think you understand.

35:17.165 --> 35:21.445
I have complete confidence in him.
I think he is an exceptional talent.

35:25.165 --> 35:27.325
I know exactly what you're doing.

35:27.885 --> 35:30.805
I'm saying take as long as you want
before you pick up a brush,

35:31.045 --> 35:33.725
-but come to the banquet.
-Do you really think so little of me?

35:34.965 --> 35:40.045
No, really, that I can be swayed
by such a transparent appeal

35:40.125 --> 35:41.565
-to my vanity?
-Sandro.

35:42.005 --> 35:44.605
You love someone, you lose them.

35:45.045 --> 35:48.125
You don't think you can carry on,
but then you go to work and you do.

35:48.205 --> 35:51.485
It gets you through the day,
from one day to the next.

35:52.205 --> 35:54.965
-But without work, without--
-Would you listen to yourself?

35:58.765 --> 36:01.085
Help me to help Giuliano.

36:02.965 --> 36:06.085
He needs us. The people who love him,
now more than ever.

36:27.605 --> 36:31.925
-Your brother needs your help tonight.
-[sighs] What does he want now?

36:33.045 --> 36:37.085
Conjuring tricks for a cardinal,
marrying one of the Pope's nieces?

36:39.765 --> 36:43.725
Ever since you were a boy, you've always
known that Lorenzo was the chosen one.

36:44.845 --> 36:46.805
If you think you were never given
any responsibility,

36:46.885 --> 36:48.725
well, that's no excuse for not taking any.
But I wish you'd stop drinking.

36:53.565 --> 36:54.845
I wish I were dead.

36:55.205 --> 36:56.765
I'd do it now if I knew I'd see her again.

36:56.845 --> 36:57.845
Don't say that.

36:57.925 --> 37:01.605
-Suicide is a mortal sin.
-So is adultery.

37:05.885 --> 37:07.565
I could put up with damnation.

37:10.645 --> 37:13.885
Together in hell for eternity.

37:16.485 --> 37:18.565
Be better than one day
on Earth without her.

37:18.645 --> 37:19.765
Oh, Giuliano.

37:20.485 --> 37:21.925
Son, please.

37:23.325 --> 37:26.285
Don't think like that.
You can be together in heaven.

37:26.365 --> 37:28.685
Repent your sins, do the right thing,

37:28.765 --> 37:32.045
live a good life. You could find peace.

37:35.725 --> 37:39.445
I don't believe in peace.
I don't believe in resurrection, I...

37:40.685 --> 37:44.525
These sunny, carefree days of youth,

37:46.045 --> 37:48.245
they're an illusion,

37:48.565 --> 37:49.965
the road to Christ...

37:55.405 --> 37:56.405
it's a dead end.

38:06.205 --> 38:08.045
Carlo say, why hasn't he come?

38:09.325 --> 38:10.565
Um, the letter's here.

38:14.045 --> 38:16.165
Why is Salviati staying here

38:17.405 --> 38:20.965
-when he has family in the city?
-He's chaperoning the young cardinal.

38:23.085 --> 38:25.525
I don't like having him under my roof.

38:26.365 --> 38:27.965
This is addressed to me.

38:28.925 --> 38:31.165
Yes, sorry, I didn't realize
until I had opened it.

38:31.765 --> 38:32.765
It's in Latin.

38:33.365 --> 38:36.045
Yes, Carlo apologizes,
says that he's busy,

38:36.125 --> 38:38.765
but that... that he's praying for us.

38:38.845 --> 38:42.845
He knows I don't speak Latin.
Why would he write to me in Latin?

38:53.325 --> 38:56.045
I thought we were using poison.
Wouldn't that be cleaner?

38:56.605 --> 38:59.005
Tell me, how do we get it
into their drinks?

38:59.845 --> 39:01.245
And their drinks only.

39:01.325 --> 39:04.605
How do we guarantee
they sup them simultaneously?

39:04.685 --> 39:05.565
[horse neighing]

39:06.005 --> 39:08.605
I will come at Lorenzo from behind
then go for his throat

39:08.685 --> 39:10.125
in case of concealed armor.

39:11.725 --> 39:14.485
You, and you, take Giuliano.

39:15.045 --> 39:17.125
The rest of you,
weapons drawn ready for guards.

39:17.245 --> 39:18.725
[horses neighing]

39:49.485 --> 39:50.925
You'd better go over

39:51.365 --> 39:54.125
and get the cardinal out of the way
when the moment arrives,

39:54.205 --> 39:56.405
and I'll do the same
for my brother and his wife.

40:13.805 --> 40:17.685
-You don't have to be here.
-I want to see Giuliano die.

40:22.325 --> 40:23.685
Keep your voice down

40:24.445 --> 40:26.005
and try to look more relaxed.

40:29.765 --> 40:31.765
-Gentlemen.
-Messer Pazzi.

40:34.005 --> 40:35.125
Thank you for coming.

40:35.205 --> 40:37.645
-It means a lot.
-Our pleasure, I'm sure.

40:42.045 --> 40:44.205
I see Lorenzo,

40:45.805 --> 40:46.965
but where's Giuliano?

40:56.365 --> 40:59.045
I'd like to introduce you to Botticelli...

41:03.485 --> 41:04.525
It's a great pleasure.

41:05.365 --> 41:06.605
He's a dear friend of mine.

41:17.365 --> 41:18.845
Why so shy, Brother?

41:20.645 --> 41:23.965
-Why don't you join us? Have some food--
-You'll get no conversation out of him.

41:24.285 --> 41:26.005
He's taken a vow of silence.

41:27.565 --> 41:29.445
Signora, please.

41:31.245 --> 41:33.965
[Raffaele] I was just telling Messer
Medici that Florence has no reason

41:34.085 --> 41:36.605
to feel threatened
by the Pope's purchase of Imola.

41:36.965 --> 41:39.605
-Or this business--
-Oh, let's not talk politics.

41:40.445 --> 41:42.405
Will your brother be joining us soon?

41:43.885 --> 41:44.885
He will.

41:47.885 --> 41:49.805
But wine will be here.

42:04.805 --> 42:07.565
Giuliano sends his apologies.
He's been detained on business.

42:07.645 --> 42:08.725
[man] Oh.

42:10.245 --> 42:13.085
Oh, that's, that's a pity.

42:14.285 --> 42:17.165
-A great pity.
-Well, you'll see him on Sunday at Mass.

42:27.525 --> 42:29.685
We should have killed Lorenzo
when we had the chance.

42:30.485 --> 42:32.485
[man] They have to die together.

42:32.845 --> 42:34.365
We all agreed to that.

42:34.605 --> 42:35.885
They're suspicious.

42:37.725 --> 42:38.565
All those guards.

42:39.045 --> 42:41.645
What if they avoid being together
in public from now on?

42:45.045 --> 42:46.765
They'll be together on Sunday.

42:51.645 --> 42:53.045
You can't be serious.

42:53.565 --> 42:56.365
-Why not?
-At Mass?

42:59.925 --> 43:01.245
They won't be expecting it.

43:01.925 --> 43:03.805
This may be our last chance.

43:04.565 --> 43:09.205
-No, we just need to be patient--
-Count Riario's men are on the march.

43:10.805 --> 43:12.245
It has to be Sunday.

43:13.805 --> 43:15.005
At Mass.

43:15.765 --> 43:18.325
I will not take a life
on consecrated ground.

43:19.645 --> 43:20.725
You need more money?

43:21.125 --> 43:22.445
Look, I have rules.

43:23.085 --> 43:24.365
A code of honor.

43:25.005 --> 43:28.565
-How much would it take?
-I will not do it, nor will my men.

43:30.565 --> 43:32.845
I will take
the government palace for you,
but any killing in the cathedral...

43:37.245 --> 43:38.565
you do yourselves.

43:45.685 --> 43:48.725
When a professional shipwright
refuses to come aboard,

43:49.045 --> 43:51.805
-think twice before setting sail.
-He's on board.

43:52.845 --> 43:54.925
He and his men will seize the palace.

43:56.365 --> 43:58.165
We'll declare a new government

43:58.885 --> 44:02.205
just as the tyrants are meeting their fate
in the cathedral

44:06.285 --> 44:08.285
in accordance with the will of God

44:10.045 --> 44:11.805
and with the blessing of the Pope.

44:17.085 --> 44:19.605
[birds chirping]

44:21.885 --> 44:24.725
Where have you been?
You insulted our guests.

44:25.005 --> 44:28.045
Breaking bread with the Pazzi, making
polite conversation with Marco Vespucci,

44:28.125 --> 44:29.605
that's a recipe for insulted guests?

44:29.765 --> 44:32.245
-Oh, well, you should've been there.
-I told him to stay away.

44:32.765 --> 44:33.845
The mood he was in, I didn't think

44:33.925 --> 44:35.885
he'd contribute much
to your diplomatic efforts.

44:35.965 --> 44:37.485
You're so obsessed with making peace

44:37.565 --> 44:39.325
you can't see your enemies
preparing for war.

44:39.405 --> 44:41.445
Do you know the Pope
has an army to Imola?

44:42.205 --> 44:44.005
He buys a town, he wants to defend it.

44:44.165 --> 44:46.205
And the rumor is
he's marching on Florence.

44:49.165 --> 44:50.885
-Where did you hear that?
-On the street.

44:51.205 --> 44:52.165
[Salviati] Ah, Giuliano.

44:54.365 --> 44:58.765
-We missed you at the banquet.
-Well, I'm here now.

45:01.085 --> 45:01.925
Shall we?

45:09.285 --> 45:10.245
[church bells tolling]

45:55.645 --> 45:56.565
[woman chuckles]

46:03.405 --> 46:05.645
A letter? Who is it from?

46:06.325 --> 46:10.005
-Francesco. Delivered last night.
-Is it important?

46:10.605 --> 46:11.645
Bank business.

46:14.925 --> 46:17.405
Hurry up. We're going to be late.

46:38.085 --> 46:39.245
[horses neighing]

46:39.405 --> 46:41.925
[indistinct chatter]

46:45.205 --> 46:46.365
Where have you been?

46:49.365 --> 46:51.805
Trying to warm myself on an old flame.

46:53.325 --> 46:56.245
-And did it work?
-No.

46:59.325 --> 47:01.085
I need to take responsibility.

47:03.005 --> 47:04.645
Starting with Simonetta.

47:05.965 --> 47:08.085
Because if there is a heaven
then she is there.

47:09.925 --> 47:11.245
That's the only hope there is.

47:16.365 --> 47:18.405
What I have done wrong,
I'll make it right.

47:19.245 --> 47:20.885
You don't need to worry about me anymore.

47:26.365 --> 47:27.445
Thank God.

47:39.165 --> 47:40.725
[horses trotting]

47:48.525 --> 47:53.725
When Cardinal Riario raises the host,
you cut their throats.

47:58.005 --> 47:59.285
In case they're wearing armor.

48:16.845 --> 48:17.845
Bastiano.

48:19.925 --> 48:23.325
-I need you to do something for me.
-They'll have no bodyguards.

48:23.405 --> 48:26.525
And their friends, the Cavalcanti cousins
are away hunting.

48:28.565 --> 48:29.405
Sure.

48:35.525 --> 48:38.085
If there is an army preparing for war,
how are you going to deal with it?

48:38.165 --> 48:41.765
More talk with palette and brush
or with sword?

48:41.845 --> 48:45.085
Well, I still believe that we must try
for a peaceful resolution.

48:46.285 --> 48:47.205
Come.

48:59.165 --> 49:01.445
I know our families
have had their disagreements,

49:01.525 --> 49:07.325
but I hope from now on we can bury that,
start new, for all our sakes.

49:10.685 --> 49:14.805
[indistinct prayer]

49:22.765 --> 49:24.005
Amen.

49:30.085 --> 49:31.525
Come here, Lorenzo.

49:37.445 --> 49:40.845
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to fight.

49:45.765 --> 49:47.765
I need to tell you something.

49:50.765 --> 49:52.685
Something no one else knows.

50:15.645 --> 50:17.885
I always meant us to be friends,
Francesco.

50:18.485 --> 50:19.725
We shall be again.

50:31.725 --> 50:33.005
And you, Giuliano,

50:33.925 --> 50:36.245
if I've done you wrong, I'm sorry.

50:38.365 --> 50:39.605
Please forgive me.

50:57.885 --> 50:59.045
I'm sorry, too.

51:15.445 --> 51:17.165
They are not wearing armor.
