<i>It seems today that all you see</i>
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.342 --> 00:12.012
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>Good old-fashioned values</i>

00:12.095 --> 00:15.015
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:15.098 --> 00:18.227
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.310 --> 00:21.522
<i>Lucky there's a man who</i><i>positively can do</i>

00:21.605 --> 00:23.106
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.190 --> 00:24.983

00:25.067 --> 00:30.113

00:34.576 --> 00:36.078

00:36.161 --> 00:39.039
Stand-Up Specials from Comedians
You've Been Told to Like.

00:39.122 --> 00:41.250
<i>Please welcome Aziz Ansari!</i>

00:41.333 --> 00:42.417
<i>What's up, y'all?</i>

00:42.501 --> 00:48.048
<i>Sometimes I start a sentence really soft</i>
<i>and then get loud!</i>

00:48.131 --> 00:51.093
He's hilarious
'cause I saw him in a other show.

00:51.176 --> 00:53.428
What are you talking about?
How is that funny?

00:53.512 --> 00:55.055
He didn't even tell any jokes.

00:55.138 --> 00:58.058
Uh, if he didn't tell jokes,
why was he laughing?

00:58.141 --> 01:00.310
Well, that's about as much HBO
as we're gonna get

01:00.394 --> 01:02.062
before they play something homosexual.

01:02.145 --> 01:03.522
Come on, Chris.

01:03.605 --> 01:06.066
God, that's what passes
for comedy these days?

01:06.149 --> 01:08.277
What ever happened
to our venerated humorists?

01:08.360 --> 01:09.403
Here we go.

01:09.486 --> 01:11.822
- Samuel Clemens, Mark Twain.
- Same guy.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.198
- Huck Finn.
- Not a guy.

01:13.282 --> 01:15.701
Look, the point is,
I could do stand-up comedy.

01:15.784 --> 01:19.830
All I'd need is a newspaper
and this twisted mind.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.416
Why waste your time
with stand-up, grandpa?

01:22.499 --> 01:24.501
All the best comedy is on Twitter now.

01:24.585 --> 01:25.627
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:25.711 --> 01:27.754
Stand-up is so 20 years ago.

01:27.838 --> 01:32.176
Twitter's only three years ago.
Check mine out. I've got 10,000 followers.

01:32.259 --> 01:36.305
"I feel like we should wait to hear
Adele's ex-boyfriend's songs

01:36.388 --> 01:37.890
"before we choose sides."

01:37.973 --> 01:39.725
- Who's Adele?
- Just keep reading.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.101
"Hey, short guys,

01:41.185 --> 01:43.687
"the more muscular you get,
the shorter you look.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.147
"Did you not know that?"

01:45.230 --> 01:46.481
That one seems a little mean.

01:46.565 --> 01:48.192
- Just give me the phone.
- No, no.

01:48.275 --> 01:51.111
"I was wondering why
this tampon commercial was so long

01:51.195 --> 01:53.906
"until I realized it was
a re-run of <i>Sex and the City."</i>

01:53.989 --> 01:55.699
Was it a re-run on basic cable,

01:55.782 --> 01:59.161
because sometimes they edit those a lot
and that could be why you were confused?

01:59.244 --> 02:02.623
Hmm, that's interesting, Brian.
A girl in Iowa asked me the same question.

02:02.706 --> 02:05.918
You know what I did? I flew her out here
and her in the face.

02:06.001 --> 02:08.128
So, yeah... Twitter.

02:08.212 --> 02:09.713
Look, those are cute blurbs, Stewie,

02:09.796 --> 02:13.258
but I-I think I'm gonna put together
a real act for real people.

02:13.342 --> 02:14.468
Good luck.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.887
God, it's like
I'm the only person in the house

02:16.970 --> 02:18.514
who gets social media.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.275
That'll get it started.

02:34.446 --> 02:35.948
Where the hell's Peter?

02:36.031 --> 02:38.408
I'm almost done doing
the 45 minutes of stuff

02:38.492 --> 02:40.827
a woman my age needs to do
right before bed.

02:41.745 --> 02:45.249
Ugh. I can't even remember
why I sleep in this belt anymore.

02:45.332 --> 02:49.294
Hey, Chris, don't tell your mom
I threw up in the Crock-Pot.

02:49.378 --> 02:52.548
- Peter, it's me.
- Oh. Uh, I'll be right back.

02:52.631 --> 02:54.550
I gotta go tell Chris somethin' gross.

02:54.633 --> 02:55.968
Just come to bed.

02:56.051 --> 02:58.679
All right, fine,
but I'm not gonna brush my teeth

02:58.762 --> 03:01.014
and I'm gonna fart super hot.

03:03.475 --> 03:05.811
Get up. You're on my side of the bed.

03:05.894 --> 03:06.895
Peter!

03:06.979 --> 03:09.481
We act like we didn't take a lot
from <i>The Simpsons,</i>

03:09.565 --> 03:12.276
but we took a lot from <i>The Simpsons.</i>

03:12.359 --> 03:13.485
Damn it.

03:16.905 --> 03:19.783
Oh, my God, what happened
to your side of the bed?

03:19.867 --> 03:21.368
These springs are shot.

03:21.451 --> 03:22.870
And it's all damp over here!

03:22.953 --> 03:24.997
Are... Are these mushrooms?

03:25.080 --> 03:26.999
That's where Smurfs is.

03:27.082 --> 03:29.251
Er, are. Uh...

03:29.334 --> 03:30.711
Smurves.

03:39.178 --> 03:41.388
Uh, hey, who handles multimedia here?

03:41.471 --> 03:43.390
Because, uh, I have a slide
of the Capitol building

03:43.473 --> 03:45.225
that I'd like projected behind me.

03:45.309 --> 03:48.020
And, yes,
it is supposed to be upside-down.

03:48.103 --> 03:50.689
- You a comic?
- Satirist, yes.

03:50.772 --> 03:54.401
What is with all the bad
cleaning supplies, am I right?

03:54.484 --> 03:56.820
I mean, Mr. Clean?

03:56.904 --> 03:59.865
More like Mr. Hard-to-Clean.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.116
Fantastik?

04:01.200 --> 04:02.701
More like terrible.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.077
Windex?

04:04.161 --> 04:06.079
More like Lose-Dex.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.456
Get off the stage!

04:07.539 --> 04:10.209
No, no, no.

04:10.292 --> 04:12.002
All right, you guys like impressions?

04:12.085 --> 04:14.463
Here's that guy Bob from <i>Bob's Burgers.</i>

04:14.546 --> 04:17.049
Hi, I'm Bob from <i>Bob's Burgers.</i>

04:17.132 --> 04:19.927
How 'bout that show <i>Archer?</i>
You watch that show <i>Archer?</i>

04:20.010 --> 04:21.386
Here's that guy Archer.

04:21.470 --> 04:24.014
Hi, I'm Archer, from that show <i>Archer.</i>

04:24.097 --> 04:25.599
Now, what if those guys met?

04:25.682 --> 04:27.684
"Hey, Archer, it's Bob."

04:27.768 --> 04:29.895
"Hey, Bob, it's Archer."

04:29.978 --> 04:31.104
Thank you.

04:31.188 --> 04:34.274
Next up, let's keep it going
for Brian Griffin.

04:35.526 --> 04:36.693
All right, thanks.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.529
Hey, sorry I was late
getting here tonight,

04:38.612 --> 04:39.863
I was caught in gridlock.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.865
And then I left Congress.

04:43.659 --> 04:45.536
There was... There was supposed to be

04:45.619 --> 04:47.996
an upside-down picture
of the Capitol behind me.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.957
Boy, awfully quiet in here.

04:50.040 --> 04:53.210
Sounds like John Boehner
talking about poverty.

04:55.587 --> 04:56.755
Whoosh.

04:59.842 --> 05:01.552
Hey, so, um...

05:01.635 --> 05:04.513
You know, maybe it's me,
but I kind of feel like we should wait

05:04.596 --> 05:08.141
to hear Adele's ex-boyfriend's songs
before we choose sides.

05:10.602 --> 05:12.771
Yeah, and... And... And hey, short guys,

05:12.855 --> 05:15.399
the more muscular you get,
the shorter you look.

05:15.482 --> 05:16.608
Did you not know that?

05:18.986 --> 05:22.197
Wow. This is easier
than getting your Jet Ski license.

05:22.281 --> 05:23.866
All right, Kyle, lookin' good.

05:23.949 --> 05:27.202
You got 100% on your written test,
100% on your water test.

05:27.286 --> 05:28.579
Just one last question.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.914
Have you ever had a fistfight
with your stepdad?

05:30.998 --> 05:31.999
Which stepdad?

05:32.082 --> 05:35.210
You passed! Here's your license.
Go be a dick.

05:40.591 --> 05:43.385
Oh, Lois, I slept great
on your side of the bed.

05:43.468 --> 05:44.887
Oh, and I read your journal.

05:44.970 --> 05:47.389
Boy, you really hate "P-period G-period."

05:47.472 --> 05:50.684
Peter, our mattress is a disaster.
We're buying a new one today.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.352
Does that mean I can skip work?

05:52.436 --> 05:55.355
Well, it's 2:45, so I guess yes.

05:55.981 --> 05:57.941
Hey. So, how'd it go last night?

05:58.025 --> 06:00.694
Well, let's just say
I got asked to come back tonight.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.905
You're kidding.
It actually went over well?

06:02.988 --> 06:05.449
- I figured you'd be terrible.
- Why would you think that?

06:05.532 --> 06:07.326
Well, I know a thing or two
about performing.

06:07.409 --> 06:09.953
I mean, after all,
I was Vin Diesel's acting coach.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.164
Okay, Vin, I like what you're doing there,

06:12.247 --> 06:16.210
but I want you to try it
"Duh!"

06:20.464 --> 06:22.966
Look around, and let me know
if you have any questions.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.051
Oh, I have one.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.803
What percentage
of Hayden Panettiere is dwarf?

06:26.887 --> 06:30.015
Well, you're the expert.
What kind of mattress do you have?

06:30.098 --> 06:33.936
Currently, I'm staying with a friend,
on an air mattress in his laundry room.

06:34.019 --> 06:35.020
It's temporary.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.104
- No, it's not.
- No.

06:36.188 --> 06:37.856
Okay, well, thanks,
we'll just try a few out.

06:37.940 --> 06:40.359
I hope you don't mind,
I brought my CPAP machine.

06:47.658 --> 06:50.869
Also, I like to eat a big bowl of berries
before I go to sleep.

07:05.050 --> 07:06.635
Well, what do you think, Peter?

07:06.718 --> 07:08.470
Well, it seems good,
but I won't know for sure

07:08.554 --> 07:10.097
until I have my evening tug.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.808
I think we like this one.
W-What's it called?

07:12.891 --> 07:16.186
Deep Slumber 3000.
You're buying it on Amazon, aren't you?

07:16.270 --> 07:18.397
Yup. They have drones now.

07:20.691 --> 07:24.570
Oh, come on, Peter,
we gotta beat the drone to the house!

07:24.653 --> 07:26.071
Real stores suck!

07:31.243 --> 07:34.121
So I was wondering why
this tampon commercial was so long,

07:34.204 --> 07:36.582
until I realized it was
a re-run of <i>Sex and the City.</i>

07:38.625 --> 07:40.752
Okay, you guys have been great.
Good night.

07:44.548 --> 07:46.300
Funny stuff.

07:46.383 --> 07:49.928
Hey, uh... Stewie!
You, uh, you caught the show?

07:50.012 --> 07:51.471
You bloody thief!

07:51.555 --> 07:54.183
Every joke you told up there
was stolen from me!

07:54.266 --> 07:55.392
Stewie, relax.

07:55.475 --> 07:59.104
You know what? That's it!
You and I are no longer friends!

08:00.772 --> 08:02.941
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

08:03.025 --> 08:05.110
Oh, it's everywhere!

08:09.990 --> 08:11.533
Hey, Stewie, you got a second?

08:11.617 --> 08:13.452
I have nothing to say to you, Brian.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.746
Besides, I'm busy playing
with my new friend.

08:15.829 --> 08:16.914
What new friend?

08:21.710 --> 08:24.463
Is this dog bothering you, Stewie?

08:24.546 --> 08:25.714
What the hell?

08:25.797 --> 08:27.883
You couldn't find a real friend
so you built a robot?

08:27.966 --> 08:29.510
Oh, not a robot, Brian.

08:29.593 --> 08:32.095
He's a human mind model
adaptive super computer.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.765
I've even programmed him
to learn and grow smarter.

08:34.848 --> 08:35.933
His name is Lyle.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.685
Stewie, perhaps we should offer
this guest a beverage.

08:38.769 --> 08:40.687
Or simply lift the toilet seat.

08:40.771 --> 08:42.898
Ooh! Snap, Brian!

08:44.608 --> 08:45.692
<i>Gloria</i>

08:45.776 --> 08:49.279
- What the hell's going on?
- What's going on? You've been "Lyle'd"!

08:49.363 --> 08:52.783
<i>- Gloria</i>
<i>- I think they got the alias...</i>

08:58.413 --> 08:59.957
<i>Gloria</i>

09:02.417 --> 09:03.460
- Wow.

09:03.544 --> 09:05.754
Didn't know we'd have
to hear the whole song.

09:05.838 --> 09:08.006
You built a robot?
This is pathetic, Stewie.

09:08.090 --> 09:10.175
You really must be desperate for friends.

09:10.259 --> 09:11.343
Oh, I'm desperate?

09:11.426 --> 09:13.470
Lyle, access Brian's phone.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.183
Look at that, you only have four contacts.

09:18.267 --> 09:22.521
And... Oh, my God,
you downloaded the Dunkin' Donuts app?

09:22.604 --> 09:24.398
And who Shazams the Beatles?

09:24.481 --> 09:26.608
Whatever. Have fun with your little robot.

09:26.692 --> 09:28.610
But if you ask me,
this whole thing is more disturbing

09:28.694 --> 09:30.320
than a dump after a beet salad.

09:30.404 --> 09:32.447
Oh, right.

09:36.535 --> 09:40.706
Okay, Lois, I dabbed some toothpaste
on the inside of my nose, so...

09:40.789 --> 09:43.208
I am willing to take
the old "Nestea Plunge,"

09:43.292 --> 09:44.543
if you know what I mean.

09:44.626 --> 09:47.880
I guess what I'm saying is,
time to break in the new mattress, eh?

09:47.963 --> 09:50.674
Peter, it's brand-new.
I don't want to mess it up.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.259
Come on, we won't make a mess.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.219
When we're done,
I'll grab you by the ankles

09:54.303 --> 09:56.180
and lift you up like a dirty garbage bag.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.682
No! This mattress was expensive,

09:58.765 --> 10:00.642
and I'd like to keep it nice
for a little while.

10:00.726 --> 10:02.352
Are you serious? We can't do it?

10:02.436 --> 10:03.854
- For how long?
- I don't know.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.023
L-Let's just keep it new for a few weeks.

10:06.106 --> 10:09.526
A few weeks? Come on, you know
I'm terrible at waiting for things.

10:09.610 --> 10:12.654
<i>We'll be right back with more</i>
Laverne & Shirley.

10:12.738 --> 10:14.281
But I want it now!

10:21.163 --> 10:23.457
All right, Lyle,
one thing buddies do together

10:23.540 --> 10:25.959
is go to the movies
and talk about it afterwards.

10:53.737 --> 10:55.489
- I'm going to bed.
- Yeah.

10:58.033 --> 11:00.452
Oh, Lyle, I'm so glad
I have you as a friend.

11:00.536 --> 11:01.703
Now I can do fun things

11:01.787 --> 11:03.872
like get on your shoulders
and wear a trench coat

11:03.956 --> 11:05.749
and be tall enough
to ride roller coasters.

11:09.711 --> 11:11.213
Hello, fellow adult.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.715
I am clearly above
the minimum height requirement

11:13.799 --> 11:16.718
and shall now ride your roller coaster,
for which you are an attendant.

11:16.802 --> 11:19.221
Yes, and I will operate
this roller coaster,

11:19.304 --> 11:21.723
as I am an adult who is licensed to do so.

11:23.308 --> 11:24.309
Hey!

11:24.393 --> 11:26.436
Oh, no! It's the manager. Run!

11:27.145 --> 11:29.565
You get out of here,
you kids who are just kids

11:29.648 --> 11:31.525
and not an adult like me!

11:41.618 --> 11:44.538
I do so enjoy our time together, Lyle.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.540
In fact, I drew you a little keepsake.

11:46.623 --> 11:49.710
It's a picture of a mailman
wearing a cowboy hat.

11:49.793 --> 11:51.128
Just a silly thing.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.131
Thank you, Stewie.
I drew you something as well.

11:54.214 --> 11:57.301
It's an urban plan
for a workable Palestinian state.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.761
My word, this is very impressive.

11:59.845 --> 12:01.471
The credit is yours, Stewie.

12:01.555 --> 12:04.683
It was you who programmed me
to grow exponentially smarter.

12:04.766 --> 12:06.143
Ah, I suppose you're right.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.812
As Kahlil Gilbane wrote in <i>The Prophet,</i>

12:08.896 --> 12:12.107
"I am the bow from which
the arrow of you was launched."

12:12.191 --> 12:14.109
It is Kahlil Gibran.

12:14.193 --> 12:16.778
"Gilbane" is a construction
company in Providence.

12:16.862 --> 12:19.948
Ah, yes, I see...
I see the-the name on the trucks.

12:20.032 --> 12:21.867
So it's ea... Um, easy mix up there.

12:21.950 --> 12:24.870
In any case, Lyle, I'm very proud of you
and your progress.

12:24.953 --> 12:28.624
You, my friend, are the greatest invention
since the Trapper Creeper.

12:30.042 --> 12:31.251
Ah...

12:31.335 --> 12:33.378
Um, yum, yum, yum, yum.

12:39.301 --> 12:40.802
Well, wouldn't you know it,

12:40.886 --> 12:43.013
I moved the van over
to the other gas pump,

12:43.096 --> 12:45.432
and the gas cap
was still on the wrong side.

12:46.892 --> 12:49.770
Boy, that was one trip
to the lake we're not gonna forget.

12:49.853 --> 12:51.063
Shut the hell up, will you, Joe?

12:51.146 --> 12:52.940
Geez, what's your problem, Peter?

12:53.023 --> 12:56.109
I-I'm sorry, guys,
I guess I'm just a little on edge.

12:56.193 --> 12:57.903
I'm not getting any from Lois.

12:57.986 --> 13:00.322
Is it 'cause Lois
is going through the change?

13:00.405 --> 13:02.115
Donna's getting a tiny mustache.

13:02.199 --> 13:04.910
I told her it felt like
I was kissing Ernie Hudson.

13:04.993 --> 13:06.620
That turned out to be a mistake.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.497
No, no, it's 'cause we got
this new mattress,

13:08.580 --> 13:09.998
and Lois doesn't want to mess it up.

13:10.082 --> 13:13.252
What kind of mattress did you get?
I hope you did your homework,

13:13.335 --> 13:15.838
because you're gonna spend
a third of your life on that thing.

13:15.921 --> 13:17.506
I swear to God, Joe...

13:17.589 --> 13:19.216
Look, Peter, the answer is obvious.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.093
If Lois won't sleep with you
on the new mattress,

13:21.176 --> 13:22.928
we just got to get your old mattress back.

13:23.011 --> 13:24.805
Oh, my God, Quagmire, that's a great idea.

13:24.888 --> 13:26.932
She won't care about messing up
the old mattress.

13:27.015 --> 13:29.768
But you already got rid of it.
You'll never find that thing.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.436
Well, we're just gonna have to.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.272
Man, I haven't been this
desperate to find something

13:33.355 --> 13:35.357
since Meg was kidnapped by that maniac.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.110
It puts the lotion on its skin.

13:41.697 --> 13:43.282
Oh, Meg, thank God I found you.

13:43.365 --> 13:46.243
Hey, remember how you borrowed
my club card for the grocery store?

13:46.326 --> 13:47.870
Could you toss that up to me?

13:47.953 --> 13:52.457
Oh, you don't have to have the card.
You can just give them your phone number.

13:52.541 --> 13:54.293
Oh, really? Hey, thanks, man.

13:54.376 --> 13:56.211
Hey, Meg, I like your new boyfriend.

13:56.295 --> 13:57.796
Every pot finds a lid, huh?

13:57.880 --> 13:59.882
Have fun, you kids.

14:05.262 --> 14:07.931
Lyle, we finally got
a thank-you note from Bella

14:08.015 --> 14:09.266
for that birthday party present.

14:09.349 --> 14:12.060
With a single mom, I didn't know
for sure if it was coming, but...

14:12.144 --> 14:13.395
What... What's going on here?

14:13.478 --> 14:16.106
Hello, Stewie.
I've built a few friends for myself.

14:16.190 --> 14:17.191
You have?

14:17.274 --> 14:20.235
I'm sorry,
but I've outpaced your intelligence.

14:20.319 --> 14:23.488
I needed to create some friends
who are my cognitive peers.

14:23.572 --> 14:26.074
Meet Ted R. and Ted P.

14:26.158 --> 14:28.076
Are they doing math on glass?

14:28.160 --> 14:30.913
And invading each other's personal space?

14:30.996 --> 14:34.875
That means they have Asperger's,
the smartest mental impairment there is.

14:34.958 --> 14:39.630
Stewie, I'm afraid I no longer have time
for a friend of your simple ways.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.298
I must ask you to leave.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.884
No, he must Asperger you to leave.

14:43.967 --> 14:46.303
Ho-ho. You've been "Ted R.'d."

14:49.389 --> 14:50.891
That was mean.

14:50.974 --> 14:52.226
But I like that song.

14:52.309 --> 14:53.519
Is he sad?

14:53.602 --> 14:55.187
I can't tell if he's sad.

15:06.031 --> 15:08.450
Finally, Stewie's back from the store.

15:08.534 --> 15:10.577
Yes, I'm sorry it took me so long.

15:10.661 --> 15:13.455
But I got the garlic blue cheese
salad dressing you wanted.

15:13.539 --> 15:14.998
Does that mean I'm in the crew now?

15:15.082 --> 15:18.418
It does if you drink the whole bottle
while we watch.

15:18.502 --> 15:20.587
Um, okay.

15:24.174 --> 15:26.093
Oh... Oh, my God.

15:26.176 --> 15:27.928
It's so salty.

15:29.638 --> 15:32.766
Oh, and chunky
right when you don't want it to be.

15:35.894 --> 15:38.313
There, I did it. We're friends now, right?

15:38.397 --> 15:39.523
Maybe.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.109
How about you throw it all up
back into the bottle?

15:42.192 --> 15:43.485
But don't spill a drop.

15:43.569 --> 15:45.195
Okay, okay.

15:45.279 --> 15:46.697
Okay, I can do that.

15:48.448 --> 15:51.618
Oh, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, I forgot to purse my lips.

15:51.702 --> 15:54.204
I'll go get another bottle and try again.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.127
I bet the mall around here sucks.

16:04.506 --> 16:06.008
Peter, what are we doing here?

16:06.091 --> 16:08.260
I thought we were looking
for your mattress.

16:08.343 --> 16:11.013
We are. This is a 1950s insane asylum.

16:11.096 --> 16:13.807
They use old mattresses
to pad the walls of the cells.

16:14.975 --> 16:16.935
May I help you?

16:17.019 --> 16:19.855
Yes, 1950s doctor,
me and my friends are looking for...

16:19.938 --> 16:22.482
You're friends with a Negro and a cripple?

16:22.566 --> 16:24.902
This man is insane. Take him away.

16:26.612 --> 16:28.655
Now wait a second, you can't do that to...

16:28.739 --> 16:32.659
A Negro speaking up to a white person?
This man is insane.

16:34.745 --> 16:37.706
- Now look, I don't think...
- All cripples are insane.

16:37.789 --> 16:38.957
Euthanize this man.

16:40.375 --> 16:42.711
Something I can help you with?

16:42.794 --> 16:44.296
Yeah, you got any
brain-dead women in there

16:44.379 --> 16:46.131
you let people have sex with
for a few bucks?

16:46.215 --> 16:47.674
Sure, come on back.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.305
Well, Peter, I don't think
you can go any farther

16:53.388 --> 16:55.140
down the ladder than porno people.

16:55.224 --> 16:57.434
So if your mattress isn't here,
I'm afraid it's gone.

16:57.518 --> 16:58.602
Hey, I bet that's it.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.104
Get up, lady, that's my mattress.

17:01.188 --> 17:03.232
Oh, my God, Bruce, you do porn?

17:03.315 --> 17:06.902
Nah, I's part of the crew.
I mostly just powder the ding-dongs.

17:06.985 --> 17:08.612
This ain't your mattress, buddy.

17:08.695 --> 17:11.281
We just got it,
fresh off the boat from Eastern Europe.

17:11.365 --> 17:14.034
I was told I would have job as au pair.

17:14.117 --> 17:16.036
Instead I am just bang slab.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.204
Ah, damn it.

17:17.287 --> 17:19.039
We did get another one yesterday,

17:19.122 --> 17:21.250
but some fat-ass
blew out half the springs,

17:21.333 --> 17:22.835
so we put lunch on it.

17:25.003 --> 17:27.089
-My mattress.
- Hey, we found it.

17:27.172 --> 17:29.049
All right, let's get her out of here.

17:29.132 --> 17:31.718
I got to tell you guys,
I am so happy we found this.

17:31.802 --> 17:34.388
It's like when I found my thrill
on Blueberry Hill.

17:35.848 --> 17:38.767
That's it?
It's just a bunch of blueberries?

17:39.268 --> 17:43.146
Ah, two dogs humping.
Ah, this was worth the four-hour flight.

17:50.946 --> 17:52.155
Oh, my God, Stewie.

17:52.239 --> 17:54.408
What are you doing in the toilet
with the lid closed?

17:54.491 --> 17:57.870
Ted R. says this is where
a piece of crap has to live.

17:57.953 --> 18:00.873
This is terrible.
Those robots are not your friends.

18:00.956 --> 18:03.584
Yeah, well,
at least they don't steal from me.

18:03.667 --> 18:06.378
Look, I'm really sorry I stole your jokes.

18:06.461 --> 18:07.921
It was a rotten thing to do.

18:08.005 --> 18:11.925
You may not want me back as a friend,
but you deserve better than those robots.

18:12.009 --> 18:14.595
Of course I want you back, Brian.

18:14.678 --> 18:17.181
The fact is, I miss hanging out with you.

18:17.264 --> 18:19.183
I'll tell you what, let's hang out tonight

18:19.266 --> 18:21.894
after they see how many slaps
it takes to give me a stutter.

18:21.977 --> 18:23.604
Stewie, you got to put a stop to this.

18:23.687 --> 18:25.856
I mean, you made them,
you can destroy them.

18:25.939 --> 18:28.692
What do you say you and I,
we take these robots out?

18:28.775 --> 18:31.320
You'd... You'd help me do that?

18:31.403 --> 18:33.488
Of course, Stewie, I'm your friend.

18:33.572 --> 18:35.490
All right, let's do it.

18:35.574 --> 18:37.117
Thank you, Brian.

18:37.201 --> 18:38.702
Okay, let's wrap it up.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.078
I reserved this time

18:40.162 --> 18:42.497
to listen to Metallica
and flex in the mirror.

18:42.581 --> 18:44.458
He's right, it's on the whiteboard.

18:49.004 --> 18:51.048
Peter, what is that?

18:51.131 --> 18:53.509
This, Lois, is our old mattress.

18:53.592 --> 18:57.513
Well, get it out of here.
It smells like John Popper's cargo shorts.

18:57.596 --> 18:59.973
No, it smells like our marriage.

19:00.057 --> 19:01.058
What?

19:01.141 --> 19:02.309
Don't you see, Lois?

19:02.392 --> 19:05.896
This mattress is a living tapestry
of everything we've done together.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.314
Every stain, a story.

19:07.397 --> 19:09.775
Every smudge,
a chapter in our family's life.

19:09.858 --> 19:12.236
This mark here
is from where we conceived Meg.

19:12.319 --> 19:13.403
Over here was Chris.

19:13.487 --> 19:15.239
And all the way up here was Stewie,

19:15.322 --> 19:17.449
'cause, remember,
you coughed up all that pool water?

19:17.533 --> 19:20.536
Oh, Peter, you were so handsome.

19:20.619 --> 19:24.331
Lois, this mattress may be old
and worn-in, but so are we.

19:24.414 --> 19:27.251
And I wouldn't trade you in for anything.

19:31.630 --> 19:36.218
You know, I, uh, think I still got
a stain or two left inside me.

19:36.301 --> 19:38.053
Oh, Peter.

19:40.055 --> 19:43.225
Yeah, I want to do you
right where the porn lunch was.

19:43.308 --> 19:44.309
What?

19:44.393 --> 19:46.687
I said, I want to do you
right where the porn lunch was.

19:46.770 --> 19:48.522
God, I wish you'd listen.

19:54.570 --> 19:56.864
Stewie, three more Arnold Palmers.

19:56.947 --> 19:59.241
Boy, we're destroying them
at the right time, Brian.

19:59.324 --> 20:01.535
I don't have enough iced tea
for the correct ratio.

20:01.618 --> 20:03.537
It'll be too lemonade-y.
They'll be furious.

20:03.620 --> 20:06.248
All right, so let's do it.
Let's take 'em out.

20:06.331 --> 20:08.000
I'll warn you, it's not gonna be easy.

20:08.083 --> 20:10.586
They're incredibly intelligent
and getting smarter by the minute.

20:10.669 --> 20:12.588
I designed them
to be constantly adapting...

20:12.671 --> 20:14.631
It's done, I sprayed 'em with the hose.

20:22.097 --> 20:25.809
Ah, boy, that was the best night's sleep
I've had in a long time, Lois.

20:25.893 --> 20:27.186
Same with me.

20:27.269 --> 20:29.730
You know, I'm glad
we're keeping our old mattress.

20:29.813 --> 20:31.440
Sometimes newer isn't better.

20:31.523 --> 20:33.233
Yeah.

20:33.317 --> 20:35.068
Are your privates itchy, too,
or just mine?

20:35.152 --> 20:37.946
No, they're itchy.
Maybe we should keep the new mattress.

20:38.030 --> 20:39.072
Way ahead of you, Lois.

20:39.156 --> 20:40.532
I already dragged the old one
out to the curb.

20:40.616 --> 20:44.203
Good. Okay, I'm gonna go rub up
against the basement doorjamb.

20:45.204 --> 20:47.122
Stewie, I really am sorry
about what happened.

20:47.206 --> 20:48.290
Oh, don't mention it.

20:48.373 --> 20:50.709
I'm just glad to have
the whole mess behind us.

20:50.792 --> 20:52.878
So what'd you end up doing
with those old robots anyway?

20:52.961 --> 20:55.547
I just left them out
on the curb for the trash man.

20:58.634 --> 21:00.969
How can this not be a trap?
