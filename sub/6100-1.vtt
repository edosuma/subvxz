No, that's his nickname.
William Marcy Tweed.

- I'll write it down for you.

34:13.217 --> 34:20.126
They called him Boss,
because he was a corrupt politician.

He had a bunch of political

know how to talk to you.

I was embarrassed,
so I took your book.

53:48.058 --> 53:49.710
Sir.

53:50.269 --> 53:53.388
- You approve?
- Too much.

53:53.814 --> 53:55.273
- It's delicious.
- It should be.

53:55.274 --> 53:58.052
I could pay my tuition
for what this meal costs.

53:58.819 --> 54:02.894
See the watch he gave me
the last time he was here?

54:02.906 --> 54:04.558
Nice.

54:05.159 --> 54:07.785
Do you miss home? I bet you do.

54:07.786 --> 54:12.407
What do you miss most of all?
The people? The country? Skiing?

54:13.167 --> 54:14.834
ELSA: I suppose all.

54:14.835 --> 54:17.033
DOC: I'm not that familiar
with Switzerland.

54:17.045 --> 54:18.880
What part are you from?

54:18.881 --> 54:22.080
A tiny place. Verbier.

54:22.760 --> 54:24.377
Verbier?

54:24.553 --> 54:26.955
- I don't believe it!
- What?

54:27.222 --> 54:31.476
A guy in my office, a ski bum,
a pain in the ass about skiing.

54:31.477 --> 54:32.518
Excuse me.

54:32.519 --> 54:38.566
He's always going on about Verbier.
Right at the foot of Mount Rosa?

54:38.567 --> 54:41.944
- It's the best skiing in the world. True?
- Of course.

54:41.945 --> 54:44.739
- DOC: Was he 100% right?
- ELSA: Sure.

54:44.740 --> 54:47.116
You must know Claude LeSeur.

54:47.117 --> 54:49.118
- Have you skied with him?
- Yeah!

54:49.119 --> 54:50.203
Where is it?

54:50.204 --> 54:52.606
- Verbier.
- Verbier.

54:53.957 --> 54:56.155
I've made all this up.

54:56.210 --> 55:00.213
There's no Mount Rosa in
Verbier or Claude LeSeur.

55:00.214 --> 55:02.662
You're not Swiss. What are you?

55:03.550 --> 55:05.293
What are you?

55:05.928 --> 55:08.956
- Can't you guess?
- Sure. German.

55:09.223 --> 55:12.968
- ELSA: Anything else?
- How long are your papers good for?

55:13.393 --> 55:16.437
Wait. If this is a joke,
it's not funny.

55:16.438 --> 55:19.682
I don't need work papers.
I'm a student here.

55:20.609 --> 55:23.903
Many foreigners marry Americans
to make things legal.

55:23.904 --> 55:26.989
- Then the marriages don't work out.
- Is that what you think of me?

55:26.990 --> 55:28.241
Stop it.

55:28.242 --> 55:31.619
- Ask me if I care for him.
- Why? You haven't told the truth so far.

55:31.620 --> 55:35.414
Why don't you ask me if I
love him? Why don't you...

55:35.415 --> 55:38.334
BABE: Wait a minute. Elsa! Wait!

55:38.335 --> 55:41.712
Let her go. She's a phoney.
She's after something. Can't you see it?

55:41.713 --> 55:44.036
Stay out of it!

about my behaviour.

57:04.963 --> 57:06.255
Not after what you've been pulling.

57:06.256 --> 57:09.660
- I've done nothing.
- So Chen acted on his own?

57:10.761 --> 57:14.889
I don't mind you hiring him,
but getting my brother involved?

57:14.890 --> 57:17.308
- It was nothing.
- It was a violation.

57:17.309 --> 57:19.810
We do not involve family, ever.

57:19.811 --> 57:23.215

Nothing more.

SZELL:
You'd like to fight, wouldn't you?

57:32.699 --> 57:34.942
It will not happen.

57:35.035 --> 57:38.314
I'm much too old and
far too smart for that.

57:38.372 --> 57:42.652
But we must talk. Truthfully.

57:43.543 --> 57:47.072
- Are you to be trusted?
- No.

57:49.841 --> 57:53.511
Is that the truth, or are you
trying again to upset me?

57:53.512 --> 57:57.014
- You'll go to the bank sooner or later.
- Perhaps I've already been.

57:57.015 --> 57:59.558
If so, you wouldn't be here with me.

57:59.559 --> 58:02.728
- What else do you know?
- I know you're panicking.

58:02.729 --> 58:06.315
- You think you'll get robbed.
- Who would do that?

58:06.316 --> 58:08.969
- Obviously, you think I would.
- Well?

58:09.736 --> 58:13.072
- Can I trust you?
- You never could. You only had to.

58:13.073 --> 58:15.817
We're talking of my safety.

58:16.410 --> 58:19.154
- May I be candid?
- Yes.

58:19.413 --> 58:22.566

Did you get my note?

59:27.814 --> 59:31.764
I've been trying you for two hours.
Finally, I just went running.

59:31.902 --> 59:34.987

- Babe...

I can't hear.

01:00:56.194 --> 01:00:58.654
You look at me like I'm
doing something wrong,

01:00:58.655 --> 01:01:01.979
like I did something wrong,
I don't understand it.

01:01:03.577 --> 01:01:05.786

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:11.750
DETECTIVE 1: You're a student.

01:01:11.751 --> 01:01:15.826
I come from a family of historians.
My card is proof.

01:01:17.424 --> 01:01:21.969
Please put the papers down.
Tell them. Put the papers down!

DETECTIVE 1:
Take it easy. What's in the papers?

01:01:24.764 --> 01:01:27.433
It's a paper I'm writing.

01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:29.310
DETECTIVE 2:
Would you tell me who this is?

01:01:29.311 --> 01:01:30.436
It's my father.

01:01:30.437 --> 01:01:32.339
DETECTIVE 1:
Where can we contact him?

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:36.058
He's not alive any more.

01:01:36.151 --> 01:01:40.279

- Yes. The license is in the drawer.

I don't know anything.

01:01:41.448 --> 01:01:45.603

It has nothing to do with it.

easy and this is a bad time for you,

you can understand that, right?

Good evening, sir.

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:39.129

- I'm a little more anxious.

01:03:09.035 --> 01:03:12.788
- I think it may have been political.
- Political? Why?

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:16.614
Considering what your brother did.
And your father, of course.

01:03:16.751 --> 01:03:20.379
- What about my father?
- He was H.V. Levy, for Christ sakes.

He's been dead for 20 years,
and he was innocent.

me some of the details.

- That's right.

- Where did your brother live?
- In Washington.

01:04:56.476 --> 01:05:00.005
- What did he do?
- Oil business.

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:01.980
Wrong.

01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:04.608
I know exactly how
Doc made his living.

01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:09.113
The closest he got to the oil business
was when he filled up with gas.

01:05:09.114 --> 01:05:13.519
- Tell me what you're talking about.
- All right. Follow me.

01:05:13.785 --> 01:05:17.037
Doc lived in Washington,

Why did he lie to me?

Things are coming together.
Down, or your head gets blown off.

01:18:03.053 --> 01:18:06.097
Those two guys I wasted
work for Christian Szell.

01:18:06.098 --> 01:18:07.807
- Know that name?
- No.

01:18:07.808 --> 01:18:10.101
He did experiments at Auschwitz.

01:18:10.102 --> 01:18:15.190
He was called The White Angel,
<i>Der Weiße Engel</i>, due to his white hair.

01:18:15.191 --> 01:18:17.775
The wealthiest and most
wanted Nazi left alive.

01:18:17.776 --> 01:18:20.304
He's hiding out in Uruguay.

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:27.452
In '45, Szell told Jews in Auschwitz
he'd help them escape for a price.

01:18:27.453 --> 01:18:31.039
He started out with gold, naturally,
but went on to diamonds.

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:32.874
Heard this?

01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:34.334
Szell saw the end early.

01:18:34.335 --> 01:18:36.544
His brother took the
diamonds to America

01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:38.963
to a safe deposit box in New York.

01:18:38.964 --> 01:18:40.215
Szell's brother had the key.

01:18:40.216 --> 01:18:42.884
The only other key
Szell kept in Uruguay.

01:18:42.885 --> 01:18:46.930
If he comes out to use it,
he'll expose himself to great risk.

01:18:46.931 --> 01:18:51.142
Everything went fine till his
brother got killed by an oil truck.

01:18:51.143 --> 01:18:53.978
Why was it natural
to start with gold?

01:18:53.979 --> 01:18:56.814
He took it from the Jews'
teeth before he burned them.

01:18:56.815 --> 01:18:58.717
Szell was a dentist.

01:19:01.612 --> 01:19:06.115
He's not coming to America,
Mr Janeway. He's here.

01:19:06.116 --> 01:19:08.076
No. We'd have known it.

01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:11.329
The dentist almost killed me.
He kept saying, "Is it safe?"

01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:14.707
White hair? Keep your head down!
Did he have white hair?

01:19:14.708 --> 01:19:16.626
He was bald.

01:19:16.627 --> 01:19:20.088
He's shaved his head!
He's here, and he's panicked.

01:19:20.089 --> 01:19:24.175
- Why is he after me?
- Your brother was a diamond courier.

01:19:24.176 --> 01:19:27.470
Szell thinks Doc said something
to you before he died.

01:19:27.471 --> 01:19:30.974
- Did he?
- You say my brother worked for Szell?

01:19:30.975 --> 01:19:34.970
No! He worked for us.
Everything we do cuts both ways.

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:38.982
Szell ratted on all his buddies.
He kept track on all the Nazis.

01:19:38.983 --> 01:19:41.567
When we wanted to bring
one in, we went to Szell.

01:19:41.568 --> 01:19:44.529
Babe, you gotta do one
thing for me, just one thing.

01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:47.156
- Quit protecting Doc!
- I'm not.

01:19:47.157 --> 01:19:50.785
- He kept alive to say something.
- He didn't.

01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:53.371
- He must have. Tell me!
- Nothing!

01:19:53.372 --> 01:19:55.365
Shit!

01:20:03.090 --> 01:20:06.718
I thought you killed them.
You killed them!

01:20:06.719 --> 01:20:08.871
You killed them!

01:20:09.888 --> 01:20:12.056
You killed them!

01:20:12.057 --> 01:20:14.425
You fucking killed them!

01:20:14.435 --> 01:20:16.837
You killed my brother!

01:20:23.736 --> 01:20:26.821
I don't think he knows anything.
I think he knows too much.

01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:30.192
You can afford to think
what you wish. I can't.

01:20:41.754 --> 01:20:45.506
The gun had blanks,
the knife a retractable blade.

01:20:45.507 --> 01:20:49.844
Hardly original, but effective enough.
I think you'll agree.

01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:57.677
Brilliant, yeah?

01:20:58.771 --> 01:21:02.815
You're an historian,
and I am part of history.

01:21:02.816 --> 01:21:06.778
I should have thought you
would have found me interesting.

01:21:06.779 --> 01:21:10.573
Frankly, I am disappointed
in your silence.

01:21:10.574 --> 01:21:13.117
Why do you have so little accent?

01:21:13.118 --> 01:21:17.205
I had alexia as a child.
Alexia is a disease...

01:21:17.206 --> 01:21:19.999
I know, it's where you can't
understand written speech.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.292

01:21:21.293 --> 01:21:27.541

but I'm a fanatic about spoken language.

I envy you your school days.
Enjoy them.

01:21:31.637 --> 01:21:35.837
It's the last time in your life
no one expects anything of you.

01:21:36.225 --> 01:21:41.396
I know I behaved terribly,
but I had to be sure what you knew.

01:21:41.397 --> 01:21:42.969
You see...

01:21:42.981 --> 01:21:46.150
I'm positive your
brother meant to rob me

01:21:46.151 --> 01:21:49.904
when I left the bank
with my diamonds.

01:21:49.905 --> 01:21:51.989

- Robbery?

01:21:59.790 --> 01:22:03.209
- You know the value of diamonds?
- No, I don't.

01:22:03.210 --> 01:22:05.878
Neither do I. Not in today's market.

01:22:05.879 --> 01:22:11.251

out before I go to the bank.

01:22:13.053 --> 01:22:14.750
You see...

01:22:17.516 --> 01:22:20.795
Your brother was incredibly strong.

01:22:21.979 --> 01:22:24.355
Strength is often inherited.

01:22:24.356 --> 01:22:25.898
He died in your arms.

01:22:25.899 --> 01:22:29.402

- I hope the key is here.

How did you find it?

01:37:16.331 --> 01:37:18.825
A girlfriend in my building.

01:37:18.916 --> 01:37:21.535
It belongs to her family. Ah.

01:37:28.551 --> 01:37:30.578
Is it Szell's?

01:37:32.764 --> 01:37:34.507

01:37:58.414 --> 01:38:00.123

What did you do for him?

- Please. Stop it!

- I didn't.

01:38:49.882 --> 01:38:51.579

We still have time.
I can get you out of here.

01:39:52.153 --> 01:39:54.476
BABE: So that was Szell.

01:40:00.328 --> 01:40:04.198

- ELSA: I don't know.

What were you?

01:40:11.088 --> 01:40:13.456
Were you Szell's mistress?

01:40:13.925 --> 01:40:19.377
- Tell me.
- No. I was a courier. Nothing more.

01:40:19.514 --> 01:40:23.714
I took money from Paris
into Uruguay, that's all.

01:40:25.019 --> 01:40:27.342
I never even met him.

01:40:31.776 --> 01:40:34.178

01:41:38.593 --> 01:41:40.370

BABE: Hold it!

01:42:02.033 --> 01:42:06.620
We're awaiting further instructions.
Do we take three giant steps or what?

01:42:06.621 --> 01:42:09.444
Cops will be here soon.

01:42:12.376 --> 01:42:14.870
I don't think the police are coming.

01:42:15.921 --> 01:42:19.621
Neither do I, but I could be wrong.

01:42:22.845 --> 01:42:28.251
We can work out what you wanna
work out, but shouldn't we do it inside?

01:42:31.062 --> 01:42:34.136
Okay. One at a time.

01:42:47.244 --> 01:42:49.897
No! Over here. Over here.

01:42:50.748 --> 01:42:52.695
Sit. Sit!

01:42:53.250 --> 01:42:57.087
You should realise we're only
authorised to go to certain limits.

01:42:57.088 --> 01:43:00.537
Cut the bullshit.
Tell me where Szell is.

01:43:00.883 --> 01:43:03.502
Why did you let us get so close?

01:43:04.261 --> 01:43:06.221
You're all in my killing range now.

01:43:06.222 --> 01:43:10.798
Taken target practice, have you?
A wizard at hitting paper?

01:43:10.935 --> 01:43:14.938
It's not the same with flesh.
Smashing bone is different...

01:43:14.939 --> 01:43:16.439
I wanna know where...

01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:18.137
Hey.

01:43:20.361 --> 01:43:22.263
...Szell is.

01:43:22.571 --> 01:43:25.031
If the police were coming,
you wouldn't be so panicky.

01:43:25.032 --> 01:43:28.436
- BABE: They're coming.
- Somehow I don't believe that.

01:43:29.954 --> 01:43:31.981
Turn it on.

Isn't that right, Erhard?

We're all just gonna sit here and
wait for the police, right, Karl?

Where is he?

01:43:51.976 --> 01:43:57.313
Elsa, why don't you move away,
give the boy some room to breathe?

01:43:57.314 --> 01:43:59.261
No!

01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:08.241
- Drop it! Get it down!
- All right, it's down!

01:44:08.242 --> 01:44:10.910
I didn't want this to happen,
but I couldn't trust them.

01:44:10.911 --> 01:44:13.405

Morning, sir. Anything I
could interest you in today?

01:45:40.668 --> 01:45:44.993
We heard that you were not there,
but I wouldn't say it was relevant.

01:45:45.381 --> 01:45:49.661
I can't give you that much.
That much I don't make.

01:46:06.777 --> 01:46:09.279
DEALER:
Okay. Maybe we can make a trade.

01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:12.949
No trade, I want cash for the ring.

01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:17.480
If you want cash, I'll give you cash.
Let me take a look at it.

01:46:22.084 --> 01:46:25.753
I'd like to see a
three-carat diamond.

01:46:25.754 --> 01:46:30.508
Why? If you just wanna see,
go window-shop.

01:46:30.509 --> 01:46:33.803
- I was interested in...
- First there's gotta be trust.

01:46:33.804 --> 01:46:37.056
So I'll get this three-carat stone.

01:46:37.057 --> 01:46:40.643
We'll take it to this
independent appraiser I know.

01:46:40.644 --> 01:46:44.689

giving this stone away,

01:46:44.690 --> 01:46:47.901

a new brother-in-law.

01:46:51.071 --> 01:46:55.491

- I'm no high-pressure artist. I sell value.

- Fifteen thousand.

01:57:33.964 --> 01:57:35.616
I'm not joking.

01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:38.543
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

01:57:41.263 --> 01:57:42.664
(YELLS)

01:57:42.722 --> 01:57:44.920
No, wait!

01:57:45.809 --> 01:57:48.644
That man who was here
has seen your gun!

01:57:48.645 --> 01:57:50.797
He'll bring others!

01:57:52.649 --> 01:57:54.392
Swallow!

01:57:55.610 --> 01:57:57.933
This is madness!

01:58:10.292 --> 01:58:11.989
Swallow.

01:59:07.766 --> 01:59:09.634
Again.

01:59:22.030 --> 01:59:23.556
No.

01:59:24.532 --> 01:59:26.149
I won't.

01:59:27.410 --> 01:59:29.653
You'll have to shoot me.

01:59:32.540 --> 01:59:34.333
Come on.

01:59:34.334 --> 01:59:36.031
Shoot.

01:59:41.383 --> 01:59:43.160
You won't.

01:59:45.470 --> 01:59:47.292
You can't.

01:59:48.932 --> 01:59:51.050
You're too weak.

01:59:52.352 --> 01:59:57.758
Your father was weak in his way,
your brother in his, now you in yours.

01:59:58.900 --> 02:00:03.350
You are all so predictable.

02:00:26.094 --> 02:00:27.620
(YELLING)

02:00:32.183 --> 02:00:34.335
Go get them!

02:00:37.272 --> 02:00:38.889
(GRUNTING)

02:00:45.155 --> 02:00:46.852
(GROANS)

02:00:47.305 --> 02:00:53.203
