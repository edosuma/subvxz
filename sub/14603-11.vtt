for "Interview" magazine,

08:33.150 --> 08:35.801
and I'm here to pick up
the package for Andy Warhol.

08:35.802 --> 08:37.970
I'm sorry.
I can't help you with that.

08:37.971 --> 08:40.072
I'm under strict orders
to give that package

08:40.073 --> 08:41.740
only to Larissa Loughlin.

08:41.741 --> 08:43.326
- Yes...
- And while I may have never met

08:43.327 --> 08:45.294
the illustrious Larissa myself,

08:45.295 --> 08:47.530
I can't believe you could be her.

08:47.531 --> 08:48.764
You look about 12.

08:48.765 --> 08:50.316
Now if you'll excuse me,

08:50.317 --> 08:52.201
I have a customer.

08:52.202 --> 08:55.988
As she walked away, it was like
<i>watching my internship</i>

08:55.989 --> 09:00.373
<i>disappear along with her.
I had to do something.</i>

09:00.539 --> 09:03.596
<i>All the women's magazines
are always encouraging you</i>

09:03.597 --> 09:04.830
<i>to be a new you,</i>

09:04.831 --> 09:06.632
<i>but being a new Carrie
wouldn't be enough.</i>

09:06.633 --> 09:10.218
<i>I needed to be a new Larissa.</i>

09:22.348 --> 09:23.900
(Imitating Larissa)
Darling, I'm going to give you

09:23.901 --> 09:26.235
the benefit of the doubt
and assume you work

09:26.236 --> 09:27.653
punishing hours in here.

09:27.654 --> 09:30.189
And that's why you seem
to have momentarily

09:30.190 --> 09:31.874
lost your faculties.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.792
Or you're new in town,

09:33.794 --> 09:36.746
so you don't know that
of course I'm Larissa Loughlin.

09:36.747 --> 09:38.464
Do I look young?

09:38.465 --> 09:41.200
Impossibly, enviably young?

09:41.201 --> 09:44.102
Of course.
I work at "Interview""

09:44.104 --> 09:46.555
not "ladies' home journal""

09:46.557 --> 09:48.941
we retire people at 25.
Harsh but true.

09:48.942 --> 09:52.177
You're the style editor
at "Interview" magazine?

09:52.179 --> 09:53.879
Yes. I know.
I get it all the time.

09:53.880 --> 09:56.314
It's the goat foreskin moisturizer.

09:56.316 --> 09:59.352
If I love it anymore,
I'd have to have sex with it.

09:59.353 --> 10:02.138
I can get you a sample.
You, uh, need it.

10:02.139 --> 10:05.024
Um... thank you?

10:05.025 --> 10:06.558
(Chuckles) No problem.

10:06.559 --> 10:09.327
We working women have to look
out for each other, don't we?

10:09.329 --> 10:12.114
Now maybe if you prove yourself,

10:12.115 --> 10:15.334
I'll take you on.
I collect people, you know.

10:15.335 --> 10:17.285
I'd heard that about you.

10:17.287 --> 10:18.788
Then I'm guessing you've also heard

10:18.789 --> 10:21.073
I'm not someone to be trifled with.

10:21.074 --> 10:22.457
So...

10:22.459 --> 10:25.461
Get me my package.
I don't like to wait.

10:25.462 --> 10:27.413
Uh, the thing is,
it's not here yet.

10:27.414 --> 10:29.515
I am so, so sorry.

10:29.516 --> 10:32.134
Mm. That is so disappointing.

10:32.135 --> 10:34.303
You were finally starting
to interest me.

10:34.304 --> 10:35.471
It should be here any minute,

10:35.472 --> 10:36.772
and maybe while you wait,

10:36.773 --> 10:40.226
you might like to try out
our fall line

10:40.227 --> 10:41.944
to make up for the in convenience.

10:41.945 --> 10:44.530
Seriously?
That would be amazing...

10:44.531 --> 10:49.600
I-I guess. I mean,
last season was so... so-so.

10:49.602 --> 10:50.703
<i>Forget being myself.</i>

10:50.704 --> 10:54.222
<i>Being Larissa was way more awesome.</i>

10:54.224 --> 10:55.908
I'm sure you're all wondering

10:55.909 --> 10:58.326
why I called you in
over spring break.

10:58.328 --> 11:00.746
Hold up. <i>You</i> called us in?
You said coach called it.

11:00.747 --> 11:03.082
As your new team manager,

11:03.083 --> 11:05.383
I felt it was important
to touch base with you all

11:05.385 --> 11:07.786
on some very important
observations I've made.

11:07.787 --> 11:10.256
(Boys laugh)

11:10.257 --> 11:11.756
No, just hear me out, guys.

11:11.758 --> 11:14.960
I think you'll be really glad
you did.

11:14.961 --> 11:16.009
Come on.

11:17.596 --> 11:18.814
Thank you.

11:18.815 --> 11:20.232
Now as team manager,

11:20.233 --> 11:22.935
I take our defeats very seriously.

11:22.936 --> 11:24.402
We're undefeated.

11:24.404 --> 11:25.837
So we're just going to
rest on our laurels?

11:25.839 --> 11:27.690
You really think
that's a good idea?

11:27.691 --> 11:29.542
I'm sure Georgetown
felt pretty confident

11:29.543 --> 11:31.243
going into the NCAA finals

11:31.244 --> 11:33.479
as the heavily favored
number one seed,

11:33.480 --> 11:35.848
only to have
eighth-seeded villanova

11:35.849 --> 11:37.415
pull the rug out from under them.

11:37.417 --> 11:40.185
That's right.
I did my research.

11:40.187 --> 11:42.327
I don't wear
the team manager badge lightly.

11:42.493 --> 11:45.124
<i>While mouse was hoping for
a productive spring break...</i>

11:45.125 --> 11:46.992
<i>(New age music playing)</i>

11:46.993 --> 11:48.627
<i>My dad just wanted
a little relaxation.</i>

11:48.628 --> 11:50.418
<i>But grownups don't get
spring break,</i>

11:50.584 --> 11:54.600
<i>so he decided to try
a meditation class instead.</i>

11:54.601 --> 11:56.051
<i>♪</i>

11:56.053 --> 11:57.553
(lowered voice) My friend swore

11:57.554 --> 12:00.439
these meditation classes
were swarming with hot babes.

12:00.440 --> 12:01.607
(Lowered voice)
Yeah, my friend Harlan

12:01.608 --> 12:02.942
told me the same thing.
Last week,

12:02.943 --> 12:05.528
he said that Carol alt
was his stretching partner.

12:05.529 --> 12:06.530
(Whispers) Oh.

12:06.531 --> 12:08.347
Guess he was talking about
classes in the city.

12:08.348 --> 12:10.349
Yeah. What a waste.

12:10.350 --> 12:11.650
Yeah. (Sighs)

12:11.651 --> 12:13.652
I mean, not that I'm just here
looking to meet women.

12:13.653 --> 12:15.216
You know, I had
a pretty hard case this week,

12:15.217 --> 12:16.789
and I-I need to relax.

12:16.790 --> 12:18.363
(Chuckles) Sure you do.

12:28.050 --> 12:30.086
Lucky you.

12:30.087 --> 12:33.222
(Woman) Now that we've
all gathered in serenity,

12:33.223 --> 12:36.509
I invite you to close your eyes.

12:36.510 --> 12:39.061
Breathe in,

12:39.062 --> 12:43.382
gathering strength
from the calm surrounding you,

12:43.383 --> 12:45.151
and breathe out,

12:45.152 --> 12:47.903
releasing toxic thoughts.

12:47.904 --> 12:51.938
(Snapping gum)

12:53.943 --> 12:56.478
Clear your mind.

12:56.480 --> 13:01.417
Picture every little worry
you have going into a bag.

13:01.418 --> 13:04.887
And now picture yourself
throwing that bag away.

13:04.888 --> 13:07.578
(Snapping gum)

13:14.376 --> 13:16.265
(Horns honking)

13:16.266 --> 13:19.467
(Indistinct conversations)

13:24.106 --> 13:25.607
Excuse me.

13:29.812 --> 13:31.728
Hey.

13:31.894 --> 13:34.433
Bennet. Hey.

13:34.434 --> 13:35.785
What are you doing here?

13:35.786 --> 13:37.987
Looking for Carrie. We <i>were</i>
supposed to have lunch.

13:37.988 --> 13:40.288
Oh. Emergency errand.
She might be gone for a while.

13:40.290 --> 13:42.158
I can give you the phone number
for where she's at

13:42.159 --> 13:44.243
if you wanna meet up with her or...

13:44.244 --> 13:45.610
Uh, I don't want to bother her.

13:45.612 --> 13:48.713
Maybe I could just go out,
get some food.

13:48.715 --> 13:50.949
- Happy to share if you're hungry.
- Really?

13:50.950 --> 13:52.885
I am pretty hungry.
Come on.

13:52.886 --> 13:55.938
Walt didn't mind the change in
<i>identity of his lunch date...</i>

13:55.939 --> 13:57.962
Come on.

13:58.128 --> 14:00.676
<i>And I didn't mind
my own change in identity.</i>

14:00.677 --> 14:02.216
<i>Okay, that was an understatement.</i>

14:02.762 --> 14:04.396
(Lowered voice) I wish
you could see me right now.

14:04.397 --> 14:05.964
I look like a different person.

14:05.965 --> 14:07.483
Why would I want that? <i>(Video
game music playing, lasers firing)</i>

14:07.484 --> 14:08.601
Oh, you know what I mean.

14:08.602 --> 14:11.737
It's just so fun
feeling like Larissa.

14:11.738 --> 14:13.989
They're giving me
the full VIP treatment.

14:13.990 --> 14:16.408
I'm in an outfit that costs $1,000

14:16.409 --> 14:19.078
and I'm drinking coffee
that's actually good.

14:19.079 --> 14:21.530
It's called a cappuccino
and it tastes like

14:21.531 --> 14:24.983
hot coffee ice cream...
Or at least I think it does.

14:24.984 --> 14:27.152
Or maybe acting like Larissa
is going to my head

14:27.153 --> 14:29.288
and now I like coffee.
(Laughs)

14:29.289 --> 14:31.155
Ugh. I know I sound like a doofus.

14:31.157 --> 14:32.823
Doofuses can be very attractive.

14:32.825 --> 14:35.343
I believe the plural
would be "doofi."

14:35.345 --> 14:37.495
Okay, maybe taking it too far.

14:37.497 --> 14:39.048
I know! That's what happens
when I...

14:39.049 --> 14:40.432
(Whispers) Act like Larissa.

14:40.433 --> 14:42.601
I just... I take things too far.
<i>("Game over" sound plays)</i>

14:42.602 --> 14:44.520
It's like I have
a totally different identity.

14:44.521 --> 14:46.939
Speaking of, got
Maggie's new I.D.

14:46.940 --> 14:48.507
Think she'll be as good
at playing "Erika Johnson""

14:48.508 --> 14:50.109
as you are at playing Larissa?

14:50.110 --> 14:51.277
Well, she'd better be

14:51.278 --> 14:53.010
if she doesn't want
to end up in juvie.

14:53.012 --> 14:55.147
Ah, juvie. Right about now,
I'd take that over where I am.

14:55.148 --> 14:57.066
(Bed thumping and creaking
overhead) Where are you?

14:57.067 --> 15:00.035
(Mr. and Mrs. Kydd moaning)

15:00.036 --> 15:01.704
Hiding in the den.

15:01.705 --> 15:02.954
Are your parents fighting?

15:02.956 --> 15:05.875
Either fighting or, uh...
(Sighs) Making up.

15:05.876 --> 15:07.710
I can't really tell
the difference at this point.

15:07.711 --> 15:09.495
Your parents are having sex?

15:09.496 --> 15:11.580
(Groans) While you're in the house?

15:11.581 --> 15:14.466
Ugh. Oh, that is horrible.

15:14.467 --> 15:16.669
(Imitating Larissa)
Oh, I've... I've got to go.

15:16.670 --> 15:18.470
Get out of there.
(Beep)

15:18.471 --> 15:22.141
Are those the packages for Andy?

15:22.142 --> 15:23.676
I-I was o-only expecting one.

15:23.677 --> 15:25.711
Oh, no. That package
isn't here yet.

15:25.712 --> 15:28.897
These are all the outfits
you just tried on.

15:28.899 --> 15:31.016
(Lowered voice) Just think
of them as a small token

15:31.017 --> 15:33.269
of the boutique's appreciation.

15:33.270 --> 15:37.656
Appreciation for...
You know.

15:37.657 --> 15:40.776
For featuring our new fall line
on the cover of "Interview."

15:40.777 --> 15:43.359
Like a... bribe?

15:43.525 --> 15:44.947
(Laughs)

15:44.948 --> 15:48.250
I know you have to play dumb,
but we both know how this works.

15:48.251 --> 15:50.683
So... what do you say?

15:59.284 --> 16:00.618
(Clicks switch)

16:02.711 --> 16:05.006
I hope seeing where your
strengths and weaknesses lie

16:05.007 --> 16:06.457
will help motivate you.

16:06.459 --> 16:08.259
We can all learn
from our mistakes, right?

16:08.261 --> 16:09.761
I don't think that's gonna work.

16:09.762 --> 16:12.379
How the hell am I ranked
lower than Alonso in hustle?

16:12.381 --> 16:15.132
He phones it in every game.
What are you talking about?

16:15.134 --> 16:17.167
Well, you never box out.
You never get back on defense.

16:17.169 --> 16:19.169
Oh, yeah?
That game against central,

16:19.171 --> 16:20.588
when that guy nailed
that outside shot

16:20.589 --> 16:21.856
in the fourth quarter,

16:21.857 --> 16:23.158
you didn't even get a hand
in his face.

16:23.159 --> 16:24.942
- (Boy) Ooh!
- Everyone has room for improvement.

16:24.944 --> 16:26.569
There's no need to fight.

16:26.735 --> 16:28.079
You want a hand in the face?

16:28.080 --> 16:29.297
- I'll show you a hand in the face.
- Oh, yeah? Come on.

16:29.298 --> 16:30.948
Guys, guys, chill out.
Come on, guys.

16:30.950 --> 16:32.783
I think this meeting is over.

16:32.785 --> 16:35.203
You guys can all go.

16:35.204 --> 16:36.787
(Boys murmuring)

16:36.789 --> 16:39.272
I've had so many more
blocked shots than you.

16:39.274 --> 16:40.825
I'm out of here.
I should've been ranked...

16:40.826 --> 16:42.326
You must be trippin'.

16:42.328 --> 16:45.045
I think it went pretty well.
They're fired up.

16:45.047 --> 16:46.613
Were you not paying attention
just now?

16:46.615 --> 16:48.466
Alonso and Pendleton
are best buddies,

16:48.467 --> 16:50.251
and you had 'em
at each other's throats.

16:50.252 --> 16:52.336
I don't know why you're so upset.

16:52.338 --> 16:55.339
You ranked number one in four
out of the five categories.

16:55.341 --> 16:56.849
You only came second in free throws

16:57.059 --> 16:58.476
because of your shoulder injury.

16:58.477 --> 17:00.312
You're a piece of work,
you know that?

17:00.313 --> 17:01.846
This is a team.

17:01.847 --> 17:03.148
To win, we have to work together,

17:03.149 --> 17:04.515
not against each other.

17:04.517 --> 17:07.769
But you're athletes.
You're all about competition.

17:07.770 --> 17:09.903
Competing against each other
will enhance results,

17:09.905 --> 17:12.856
like when I found out you were
number one in the class.

17:12.858 --> 17:15.109
Am, not <i>were.</i>

17:15.111 --> 17:17.829
I <i>am</i> number one in the class.

17:17.829 --> 17:19.146
Not for long.

17:19.147 --> 17:21.900
Because feeling competitive
with you motivated me.

17:21.901 --> 17:26.036
And I haven't scored less than
100% on any test since.

17:26.038 --> 17:27.871
And if it takes a little arguing

17:27.873 --> 17:29.958
to make the team more
competitive, it'll be worth it.

17:29.959 --> 17:32.711
You have to fix this.
I can't have my guys fighting.

17:32.712 --> 17:34.129
It's bad for morale.

17:34.130 --> 17:36.639
And bad for winning.

17:38.216 --> 17:42.303
Girl, you are gonna be worse for
this team than Donna Ladonna,

17:42.304 --> 17:45.673
and she almost <i>destroyed</i> us.

17:45.674 --> 17:47.007
(Door opens)

17:47.009 --> 17:50.845
And as we begin our final series
of deep breathing,

17:50.846 --> 17:54.666
you should already feel
nice and relaxed,

17:54.667 --> 17:58.236
calm and centered...
(Snapping gum)

17:58.237 --> 17:59.520
Ready to face the world.

17:59.521 --> 18:01.489
Ha! Are you kidding me?!

18:01.490 --> 18:02.991
You... (Laughing)

18:02.992 --> 18:05.817
- Excuse me?
- It's the gum.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.412
I mean, you... you have been
at this for over an hour now

18:07.413 --> 18:09.530
with the constant...

18:09.531 --> 18:11.032
Snapping and the...
And the chomping.

18:11.033 --> 18:12.217
I-I-I cannot be the only one

18:12.218 --> 18:15.219
whose head is about
to explode here.

18:15.221 --> 18:17.538
I... (Chuckles)

18:17.539 --> 18:19.540
I, uh, I think you are.

18:19.541 --> 18:21.393
No, no, no,
they're all being polite

18:21.394 --> 18:23.845
because you are driving
everybody insane.

18:23.846 --> 18:25.146
Well, maybe it's just <i>you.</i>

18:25.147 --> 18:26.347
(Mouths word)

18:26.348 --> 18:27.432
Because maybe, just maybe,

18:27.433 --> 18:30.518
from your...
Little outburst there,

18:30.519 --> 18:31.853
you're insane.

18:31.854 --> 18:33.737
Come on!

18:33.739 --> 18:35.490
The gum chewing?!

18:35.491 --> 18:38.827
It was <i>so</i> loud!

18:38.828 --> 18:42.280
You know what? Screw it.
Screw it. I d...

18:42.281 --> 18:43.414
You hippie freaks.

18:47.068 --> 18:48.903
This is one of the best perks
of the job.

18:48.904 --> 18:50.538
Puffed cheese straw?
No, thanks.

18:50.539 --> 18:53.674
(Telephone rings)

18:53.840 --> 18:55.977
"Interview" magazine.
This is Bennet.

18:55.978 --> 18:57.511
(Whispers) <i>Please</i> tell me
Larissa's back in the office.

18:57.513 --> 18:58.963
Larissa's not back in the office.

18:58.964 --> 19:00.581
Why are you whispering?

19:00.582 --> 19:02.434
I'm whispering because I still
don't have Andy's package.

19:02.435 --> 19:05.636
And the woman who works
at the store thinks I'm Larissa.

19:05.638 --> 19:08.022
And she's trying to bribe me
with free clothes

19:08.023 --> 19:09.557
that I'm supposed to put
on the cover of "Interview."

19:09.558 --> 19:11.226
Really? What kind of clothes?

19:11.227 --> 19:13.111
That's not the point.

19:13.112 --> 19:16.948
Okay, there is this one
really amazing silver tube dress

19:16.949 --> 19:18.783
that normally I would not
be caught dead I.

19:18.784 --> 19:21.494
But I tried it on, and...

19:21.770 --> 19:24.239
Ugh! What am I saying?
That's not the point.

19:24.240 --> 19:25.438
What am I supposed to do?

19:25.440 --> 19:27.942
I mean, I can't take
all these clothes.

19:27.943 --> 19:29.110
Why not?

19:29.111 --> 19:31.128
Well, wouldn't it be illegal
or something?

19:31.130 --> 19:33.548
Unethical murky area? Yes.

19:33.549 --> 19:35.750
Illegal?
Nah. Everyone does it.

19:35.751 --> 19:37.584
How do you think
Larissa looks so fab?

19:37.586 --> 19:39.837
She can't afford that wardrobe
on her salary.

19:39.839 --> 19:42.256
I say if that woman thinks
you're Larissa,

19:42.258 --> 19:44.759
you take the clothes,
get Andy's package,

19:44.760 --> 19:45.760
and get the hell out of there.

19:45.761 --> 19:47.512
(Woman) Is Larissa Loughlin here?

19:47.513 --> 19:50.315
- That must be the package. I gotta go.
- There's a delivery girl here.

19:50.316 --> 19:51.732
Um...

19:51.734 --> 19:55.153
(Exhales) I'm Larissa Loughlin.
You have my package?

19:55.154 --> 19:56.237
Yes.

19:56.238 --> 19:59.407
And I have something else
for you, too.

19:59.408 --> 20:00.474
Larissa Loughlin,

20:00.475 --> 20:03.011
I'm going to kill you. Aah!

20:03.012 --> 20:05.381
(Vase shatters)

20:09.149 --> 20:12.076
Uh, I-I think
you've got this all wrong.

20:12.078 --> 20:13.478
Oh, really?
Did it feel wrong

20:13.479 --> 20:16.981
when you were sleeping with
my boyfriend, Larissa?

20:16.982 --> 20:18.398
No! Aah!

20:18.399 --> 20:19.427
I bet you're wondering
where he is, aren't you?

20:19.428 --> 20:21.964
You do have a nice,
little routine, don't you?

20:21.965 --> 20:23.655
He delivers Andy's packages,

20:23.656 --> 20:27.158
and then you get
an afternoon quickie.

20:27.159 --> 20:28.375
Well, not this afternoon!

20:28.377 --> 20:30.161
I think this is all
a big misunderstanding.

20:30.162 --> 20:34.349
Lucky for me, he passed out from
too many quaaludes this morning.

20:34.350 --> 20:36.501
So I delivered the package myself.

20:36.502 --> 20:37.786
Look, I...
Save it, bitch!

20:37.787 --> 20:39.170
Stop!

20:39.171 --> 20:40.789
What are you doing?!

20:40.790 --> 20:41.889
What am I doing?

20:41.891 --> 20:44.075
I am going to kill
Larissa Loughlin.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.226
What did you do?

20:46.228 --> 20:48.979
I didn't actually do anything
because I'm not Larissa.

20:48.981 --> 20:50.865
My name is Carrie Bradshaw.
I'm 17.

20:50.866 --> 20:52.317
I-I'm just an intern.

20:52.318 --> 20:54.319
I knew it!

20:54.320 --> 20:55.370
Have at her!

20:55.371 --> 20:57.121
I don't care
<i>what</i> you call yourself.

20:57.123 --> 20:58.789
You <i>ruined</i> my life!

20:58.791 --> 21:01.409
Aah! Aah!
No, not the clothes!

21:01.410 --> 21:02.826
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry.

21:02.828 --> 21:03.995
- Aah!
- He's mine!

21:03.996 --> 21:06.748
Good luck getting that to Andy.

21:06.749 --> 21:08.083
It's not even cut!
(Hangers clattering)

21:08.084 --> 21:11.136
Oh, my God. Is she a drug mule?
It that coke?

21:11.137 --> 21:13.171
I want some.

21:13.172 --> 21:14.356
Get off of me.

21:18.893 --> 21:20.345
(Door closes)

21:20.346 --> 21:21.429
Uh...

21:21.430 --> 21:23.397
Excuse me for a minute.
I... (Sighs)

21:23.399 --> 21:24.933
Now what?

21:24.934 --> 21:26.318
(Sighs)

21:26.319 --> 21:28.686
I just... I wanted to apologize.

21:28.688 --> 21:30.521
After I left and I calmed down,

21:30.523 --> 21:33.525
I felt pretty stupid,
yelling at you like that.

21:33.526 --> 21:34.609
I mean, it turns out

21:34.610 --> 21:36.728
all I needed to relax
was a cheeseburger.

21:36.729 --> 21:41.116
So... (Smacking)
(Chuckles)

21:41.117 --> 21:42.400
That's very funny.

21:42.401 --> 21:44.067
What's funny?

21:44.069 --> 21:46.454
I'm... giving you
the benefit of the doubt

21:46.455 --> 21:49.991
that you are making a joke
based on our last interaction.

21:49.992 --> 21:52.377
I don't know what you mean.

21:52.378 --> 21:54.129
Really? You don't?

21:54.130 --> 21:55.680
(Chewing loudly)

21:55.681 --> 21:59.393
You are doing that on
purpose just to bug me.

21:59.394 --> 22:00.968
Nobody really chews
their gum like that.

22:00.970 --> 22:03.354
(Pop) I do.

22:03.356 --> 22:05.973
I don't even know your name,

22:05.975 --> 22:08.443
but you might be
the most annoying woman

22:08.444 --> 22:10.595
I have ever met.

22:10.596 --> 22:12.981
(Breathing heavily)

22:12.982 --> 22:14.399
I'm Deb.

22:14.400 --> 22:15.734
Tom.

22:15.735 --> 22:18.935
(Continues breathing heavily)

22:25.627 --> 22:27.345
Donna?

22:27.346 --> 22:29.947
Oh, look, a nerd can't stay away
from her natural habitat

22:29.948 --> 22:32.633
even during spring break.
How cute.

22:32.635 --> 22:33.785
Hey, you're during
spring break, too.

22:33.786 --> 22:36.120
Duh! I'm here for the guy-watching.

22:36.121 --> 22:37.505
This is the only time of year

22:37.506 --> 22:39.123
when baseball, basketball,
and soccer

22:39.124 --> 22:41.559
are all practicing
at the same time. Toodles.

22:41.560 --> 22:42.594
Oh, wait.

22:42.595 --> 22:44.679
Before you go, um...

22:44.680 --> 22:46.681
I know this isn't
any of my business,

22:46.682 --> 22:48.400
but is there
some weird history between you

22:48.401 --> 22:50.768
and the basketball team?
What do you mean?

22:50.770 --> 22:53.320
Is there any reason they might
think you almost destroyed them?

22:53.322 --> 22:55.824
Oh! That. (Laughs)

22:55.825 --> 22:58.158
(Exhales) Oh, I went through
an indecisive phase last year.

22:58.160 --> 23:00.945
I dated two players
at the same time.

23:00.946 --> 23:03.747
Of course, they both became
obsessed with me,

23:03.749 --> 23:05.983
and then when they found out
about each other,

23:05.984 --> 23:07.168
they both spazzed.

23:07.169 --> 23:09.838
They were, like, fighting
about me during games.

23:09.839 --> 23:11.456
You know how men are.

23:11.457 --> 23:14.591
Yeah. Sure. Totally.
I know.

23:14.593 --> 23:16.911
Do you remember that 3-game
losing streak last season?

23:16.912 --> 23:19.047
That was you?
Mm-hmm.

23:19.048 --> 23:21.132
Then what?
How did it get fixed?

23:21.133 --> 23:22.967
Yeah, I dumped them both.

23:22.968 --> 23:24.185
Once they had me to hate
as a common enemy,

23:24.186 --> 23:25.219
they became friends again.

23:25.221 --> 23:26.971
And so <i>now...</i>

23:26.972 --> 23:28.991
I am into soccer players.

23:31.117 --> 23:33.344
<i>While mouse was getting an idea,</i>

23:33.345 --> 23:35.346
<i>Maggie got the brand-new identity</i>

23:35.347 --> 23:37.115
<i>she'd been hoping for.</i>

23:37.116 --> 23:38.650
This is perfect.

23:38.651 --> 23:40.034
Thank you for going
to all that trouble.

23:40.035 --> 23:41.152
No trouble at all.

23:41.153 --> 23:42.654
I needed an excuse
to get out of the house

23:42.655 --> 23:44.789
and away from my parents.

23:44.790 --> 23:46.574
So it's "reunited,
but it doesn't feel so good"?

23:46.575 --> 23:49.694
Yeah. Kinda wish they
wouldn't reunite at all.

23:49.695 --> 23:51.245
Carrie thinks that's crazy.

23:51.247 --> 23:53.748
Yeah, but she doesn't have
parents who hate each other.

23:53.749 --> 23:57.801
All my parents do is fight.
It's annoying and loud.

23:57.803 --> 23:59.637
They only stay together
'cause they're catholic.

23:59.638 --> 24:01.172
When I was little,
I used to actually pray

24:01.173 --> 24:03.842
they would get a divorce
just to stop the yelling.

24:03.843 --> 24:05.877
I don't think that's what
the pope had in mind.

24:05.878 --> 24:06.904
Probably not.

24:10.565 --> 24:12.451
(Whispers) Oh... my God.

24:13.651 --> 24:14.886
Is that Mr. Bradshaw?

24:14.887 --> 24:17.489
Yeah, it is. Let's go.

24:17.490 --> 24:20.691
(Indistinct conversations)

24:22.911 --> 24:24.578
Oh! Walt! I'm sorry about lunch.

24:24.580 --> 24:28.198
Bennet was just showing me
his new column. Are you okay?

24:28.200 --> 24:31.920
Yeah. You look kinda crazed.
And what are you wearing?

24:31.921 --> 24:34.339
Oh, you know, I accidentally
took the express train

24:34.340 --> 24:35.840
and ended up in the Bronx

24:35.841 --> 24:37.674
in a $1,000 couture outfit,

24:37.676 --> 24:39.544
which I accidentally
stole from Krizia,

24:39.545 --> 24:42.095
where I was nearly killed
by a psychotic woman

24:42.097 --> 24:44.131
who thought I was sleeping
with her boyfriend

24:44.133 --> 24:46.650
because Larissa is sleeping
with her boyfriend.

24:46.652 --> 24:48.852
And now apparently,
I'm a drug courier, too.

24:48.854 --> 24:50.622
There is something uncut
in here for Andy...

24:50.623 --> 24:52.723
(Whispers) And I'm pretty sure
it's cocaine.

24:52.725 --> 24:54.391
(Normal voice)
And I'm afraid to open it.

24:54.393 --> 24:56.928
Yikes.
(Sighs) It's... oh!

24:56.929 --> 24:59.096
How did this happen?

24:59.097 --> 25:02.232
I mean, all I wanted to be was
a slightly more New York version

25:02.234 --> 25:04.234
of myself and impress Larissa,
but this...

25:04.236 --> 25:05.620
This is not
what I signed up for. I mean...

25:05.621 --> 25:06.703
Carrie?

25:06.705 --> 25:08.206
What? I'm having
a nervous breakdown.

25:08.207 --> 25:11.108
Oh, my.
It's... Andy's wig,

25:11.109 --> 25:13.277
and it hasn't been cut yet.

25:13.278 --> 25:15.630
(Gasps) (Laughs)

25:15.631 --> 25:17.397
So that's what that crazy woman
meant by "uncut."

25:17.399 --> 25:19.667
Yep. No drugs.
Just... Andy's wig.

25:19.668 --> 25:20.951
(Chuckles)

25:20.953 --> 25:22.136
He's very particular about it.

25:22.137 --> 25:23.421
At least, that's what I've heard.

25:23.422 --> 25:25.672
Apparently, he's never
admitted it's a wig,

25:25.674 --> 25:27.474
and he only orders them
from this one guy.

25:27.476 --> 25:30.562
Yeah, this one guy Larissa
is sleeping with.

25:30.563 --> 25:33.146
Okay, so I'm not a total failure.

25:33.148 --> 25:35.233
I can still get this to Andy
at that club

25:35.234 --> 25:37.651
by the end of the day.
It's only 5:30.

25:37.653 --> 25:38.970
Sounds like the end of the day
to me.

25:38.971 --> 25:41.962
Okay. Let's get this wrapped up
and head out.

25:55.523 --> 25:58.025
What... is this place?

25:58.027 --> 26:00.694
Um... does Andy have some
sort of kids' clothing fetish

26:00.975 --> 26:02.614
that we don't know about
or something?

26:02.615 --> 26:03.748
I wouldn't put it past him.

26:03.749 --> 26:05.700
I must have written down
the wrong address

26:05.701 --> 26:08.752
because this is definitely not
a club.

26:08.754 --> 26:11.039
Andy's assistant was talking
so fast.

26:11.040 --> 26:12.057
What do we do now?

26:12.058 --> 26:13.590
There's nothing we <i>can</i> do.

26:13.592 --> 26:15.727
I screwed up the address,
which means this whole day

26:15.728 --> 26:17.044
has been a waste of time.

26:17.046 --> 26:22.033
Because of me, Andy Warhol
is out there somewhere, bald.

26:22.034 --> 26:25.135
(Chuckles) So much for
my summer job at "Interview."

26:25.137 --> 26:28.139
(Sighs)
Larissa is going to kill me.

26:28.140 --> 26:29.506
Let's just go.

26:29.508 --> 26:31.526
<i>(Electronic music playing)</i>

26:31.527 --> 26:34.028
W-wait a sec.
Do you hear that?

26:34.030 --> 26:35.680
All I can hear is the sound
of my own failure,

26:35.681 --> 26:37.297
echoing in my head.

26:37.299 --> 26:40.017
<i>♪</i>

26:40.018 --> 26:42.370
Wait. Is... is that music?

26:42.371 --> 26:44.522
That is definitely
the sound of throbbing bass,

26:44.523 --> 26:46.041
which can mean only one thing.

26:46.042 --> 26:48.742
There's a club around here
somewhere.

26:48.744 --> 26:50.544
<i>♪</i>

26:50.546 --> 26:52.297
This must be
the traveling underground club

26:52.298 --> 26:53.665
I've heard about.

26:53.666 --> 26:56.800
It's open 24 hours, and they
change locations every week.

26:56.802 --> 26:58.969
I've never been able to find it.

26:59.450 --> 27:00.827
Until now.

27:03.508 --> 27:05.843
That was the grodiest thing
I've ever seen.

27:05.845 --> 27:08.245
Mr. Bradshaw out in public
like that.

27:08.247 --> 27:09.431
It's worse than Jack Nicholson
and Shirley MacLaine

27:09.432 --> 27:11.129
making out
in "terms of endearment""

27:12.534 --> 27:14.601
how are we gonna tell Carrie?
We're not.

27:14.603 --> 27:16.104
What? We have to tell her.
She's my friend.

27:16.105 --> 27:17.355
She's <i>your</i> girlfriend.

27:17.356 --> 27:18.823
Doesn't she need to know the truth?

27:18.824 --> 27:20.492
Not if it'll hurt her,
and we don't even know

27:20.493 --> 27:22.226
if what was going on
in that car means anything.

27:22.227 --> 27:25.195
Maybe it's just a, you know,
onetime thing.

27:25.197 --> 27:26.731
I did not think anything
could make it grodier,

27:26.732 --> 27:27.831
but you just did.

27:27.833 --> 27:30.200
No one wants to have
to get involved

27:30.202 --> 27:31.453
in their parents' personal lives.

27:31.454 --> 27:34.838
We want them to be parents,
not people. Believe me.

27:34.840 --> 27:37.207
Hmm. You're right.
It would freak her out.

27:37.209 --> 27:39.593
And, yeah, I mean, it probably
didn't mean anything.

27:39.595 --> 27:41.513
Okay.

27:41.514 --> 27:43.431
My lips are sealed.
You've got a deal.

27:43.432 --> 27:44.849
All right.

27:44.850 --> 27:47.769
Mouse.

27:47.770 --> 27:49.120
Oh, hi.

27:49.121 --> 27:50.387
What's going on with you?

27:50.389 --> 27:52.106
Every time we see you lately,
you're on the run.

27:52.108 --> 27:55.299
Um... that's because
I have a lot to do.

27:59.430 --> 28:00.698
Guys.

28:00.699 --> 28:02.199
We've gotta get past this.

28:02.201 --> 28:06.771
French fries, burgers,
and a grilled cheese.

28:06.772 --> 28:08.438
Do you know what a fatty diet

28:08.440 --> 28:10.742
will do to your endurance
on the court?

28:10.743 --> 28:11.940
What is it now, mouse?

28:13.812 --> 28:15.964
It's... I've been thinking
about what happened

28:15.965 --> 28:17.548
at the meeting, and...

28:17.550 --> 28:19.083
You guys all seemed really upset,

28:19.084 --> 28:23.137
so I just... I just
really wanted to say

28:23.139 --> 28:25.889
that you guys need to grow
<i>some balls!</i>

28:25.891 --> 28:27.258
- Huh?
- You heard me.

28:27.259 --> 28:29.961
Balls.

28:29.962 --> 28:32.647
And not the kind you dribble
on the court, erratically,

28:32.648 --> 28:35.266
in your case, Pendleton.

28:35.267 --> 28:36.683
You're athletes.

28:36.685 --> 28:38.552
Are you really just going to
fall apart

28:38.554 --> 28:40.505
because one of
the geekiest girls in school

28:40.506 --> 28:42.524
pointed out your mistakes?

28:42.525 --> 28:44.609
(Dishes clatter)
Deal with it, you wusses!

28:44.610 --> 28:45.660
Hey, mouse?

28:45.661 --> 28:47.328
Yes?

28:47.329 --> 28:48.546
You're fired.

28:48.547 --> 28:50.020
Fired?

28:52.750 --> 28:54.483
And we're gonna need that I.D.

28:59.007 --> 29:00.507
(Gasps)

29:00.509 --> 29:04.846
There you are. I was frantic.
Where have you been?

29:04.847 --> 29:06.597
Meeting a friend, like I told you.

29:06.599 --> 29:08.165
Don't tell me
you were worried about me.

29:08.166 --> 29:09.333
No, not worried.

29:09.334 --> 29:12.836
I-I just needed to talk.
It's your father.

29:12.838 --> 29:16.441
We had another fight,
and he wants me to leave...

29:16.442 --> 29:17.724
For good.

29:17.726 --> 29:20.695
I was hoping that you could
reason with him.

29:20.696 --> 29:22.446
Reason with him about what?

29:22.448 --> 29:24.314
About giving me another chance,

29:24.316 --> 29:26.617
giving our family another chance.

29:26.619 --> 29:29.486
We can't give up just because
of some silly little fight.

29:29.488 --> 29:32.740
Please, Sebastian, I need you.

29:32.741 --> 29:34.157
You've always been my rock,

29:34.159 --> 29:37.461
my hero, even when
you were a little boy.

29:37.463 --> 29:41.798
Yeah, doesn't that sound
profoundly messed up to you?

29:41.800 --> 29:44.035
I'm not supposed to be your hero

29:44.036 --> 29:47.088
or your rock
or the person you talk to

29:47.089 --> 29:48.172
about your screwed up problems.

29:48.173 --> 29:49.841
I'm your kid.

29:49.842 --> 29:51.959
You should feel good
that I feel so close to you.

29:51.961 --> 29:54.177
Well, you barely know
anything about me.

29:54.179 --> 29:56.598
And you certainly don't seem
like you care about me

29:56.599 --> 29:58.182
or what's good for me.

29:58.183 --> 29:59.684
Why would you say that?

29:59.685 --> 30:02.603
I came back so that
we could be a family again.

30:02.605 --> 30:03.938
But all you guys do is fight.

30:03.939 --> 30:05.456
You hurt each other, and then
you put me in the middle.

30:05.457 --> 30:07.013
That's not being a family.

30:09.744 --> 30:10.995
You're right.

30:18.003 --> 30:19.836

30:23.124 --> 30:25.793
I-I wanna do what's right for you

30:25.794 --> 30:27.177
and for this family.

30:27.179 --> 30:29.430
Well, what's right for this family

30:29.431 --> 30:31.997
might be you and dad being apart.

30:37.689 --> 30:41.339
I guess... I'm
afraid to be alone.

30:43.544 --> 30:46.595
I love you so much, Sebastian.

30:52.687 --> 30:54.770
You will always have me, mom.

30:56.157 --> 30:57.647
Always.

31:04.281 --> 31:05.549

31:05.551 --> 31:07.385
I really think
we should think this through.

31:07.386 --> 31:10.171
I-I've heard this place is
beyond impossible to get into.

31:10.172 --> 31:12.674
I mean... we at least
need some sort of plan

31:12.675 --> 31:15.559
or a contact, someone in the know.

31:16.082 --> 31:18.295
I-I just don't think it's...
Or I could do this.

my short-term memory

32:50.496 --> 32:53.064
may be severely compromised from
years of recreational drug use,

32:53.065 --> 32:55.032

32:55.034 --> 32:57.002
you just tried
to fake your way in here,

32:57.003 --> 32:58.570
so how about you just
stop wasting my time?

32:58.571 --> 33:00.788
I only need to waste
one more minute of your time,

33:13.115 --> 33:16.087
I'm a girl who loves the city

37:12.884 --> 37:15.420
And if anyone thinks otherwise,

37:15.421 --> 37:16.818
they're wrong.

37:16.984 --> 37:21.125
I wish it were that simple.

37:21.126 --> 37:23.728
(Sighs) Yeah.

37:23.729 --> 37:25.618
Me, too.

37:27.298 --> 37:30.402
But... you know, whatever happens,

37:30.403 --> 37:33.654
I love you, and I'm here for you.

37:33.656 --> 37:35.189
Thanks.

37:35.461 --> 37:37.475
<i>Walt was finally figuring out
who he was,</i>

37:37.476 --> 37:40.111
<i>embracing his new identity,</i>

37:40.112 --> 37:41.362
and it was clear to both of us

37:41.363 --> 37:43.261
<i>that it wasn't going to be easy.</i>

37:45.483 --> 37:46.785
<i>The next day,</i>

37:46.786 --> 37:49.670
<i>mouse was taking her change
in identity in stride.</i>

37:49.672 --> 37:52.123
Mouse, what's up?

37:52.124 --> 37:53.757
Didn't expect to see you here.

37:53.759 --> 37:55.659
Figured you'd be enjoying
your spring break

37:55.661 --> 37:57.544
now that you're not
team manager anymore.

37:57.546 --> 37:59.027
Sorry about that.

37:59.193 --> 38:02.183
Don't be. I signed up
for habitat for humanity.

38:02.184 --> 38:04.635
Apparently, colleges are big
on philanthropy this year.

38:04.637 --> 38:06.386
(Chuckles) I'm glad you're not mad.

38:06.388 --> 38:09.540
I just feel bad
how it all went down.

38:09.542 --> 38:11.976
I meant to get fired.

38:11.977 --> 38:13.061
What?

38:13.062 --> 38:14.562
Let's just say I learned
a little something

38:14.563 --> 38:17.670
from the team's
previous pariah... Donna.

38:17.836 --> 38:20.985
I decided to give you guys
a common enemy... me...

38:20.986 --> 38:23.821
To bring you back together.
And it worked, didn't it?

38:23.823 --> 38:27.574
That's pretty brilliant,
in an evil genius kind of way.

38:27.576 --> 38:29.660
Did you just call me a genius?

38:29.662 --> 38:31.879
You heard <i>that</i> over evil?

38:31.881 --> 38:33.196
Of course I did.

38:33.198 --> 38:35.666
Well, see you around.

38:37.001 --> 38:38.369
I don't really think you're evil,

38:38.370 --> 38:41.005
and I'm sorry to see you go.

38:41.006 --> 38:42.339
You gonna miss me?

38:42.341 --> 38:43.891
Pfft. No way.

38:43.893 --> 38:44.975
(Giggles)

38:44.977 --> 38:46.594
Maybe.

38:46.595 --> 38:49.596
(A-ha's "take on me" playing)

38:49.598 --> 38:51.849
What?

38:51.851 --> 38:53.998
You heard me.

38:54.164 --> 38:56.053
<i>Mouse was so accustomed
to west's identity</i>

38:56.054 --> 38:58.253
<i>as her academic Nemesis,</i>

38:58.419 --> 39:00.713

<i>♪ Talking away</i>

39:05.781 --> 39:08.283
thanks. So it turned out

39:08.284 --> 39:11.085
Andy got the wig,
and everything was fine.

39:11.086 --> 39:13.338
But Larissa still
wasn't there today.

39:13.339 --> 39:14.873
So she just takes off
from work for two days?

39:14.874 --> 39:16.240
How does she not get fired?

39:16.241 --> 39:18.176
She was working this whole time.

39:18.177 --> 39:21.963
She's upstate smelling things
with Grace Jones.

39:21.964 --> 39:24.631
I think Grace Jones
is doing a perfume,

39:24.633 --> 39:26.517
but I'm not totally sure.

39:26.519 --> 39:30.253
Anyway, Larissa called today
to thank me for saving her ass,

39:30.255 --> 39:32.557
and she even said
if the office had cubicles,

39:32.558 --> 39:33.758
she'd give me one.

39:33.759 --> 39:35.560
So I think it's safe to say that
that summer job

39:35.561 --> 39:38.228
is a real possibility.
Well, good for you.

39:38.230 --> 39:40.481
So what have you been up to
besides missing me like crazy?

39:40.482 --> 39:43.768
Ah, not much.
My mom split again.

39:43.769 --> 39:45.403
She's back with Lucas.

39:45.404 --> 39:47.237
I think my parents
are done for good this time.

39:47.239 --> 39:50.555
I'm sorry. Although that's what
you wanted, right?

39:50.721 --> 39:53.160
(Mouth full) Yeah. It's better
this way, believe me.

39:53.162 --> 39:54.711
I do.

39:54.713 --> 39:57.614
So what else did I miss
in good old Castlebury?

39:57.616 --> 40:02.303
No, nothing much.
Just the usual suburban boredom.

40:02.304 --> 40:04.221
Nothing like what happened
to you in the city.

40:04.223 --> 40:05.506
Tell me more about last night.

40:05.507 --> 40:07.759
Did anything else happen
after you dropped off the wig?

40:07.760 --> 40:10.962
Uh... nope. Walt and I
took the train home.
