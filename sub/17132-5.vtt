WEBVTT

00:02.403 --> 00:04.572
HEY, OBIE,
I'LL TAKE A BEER.

00:04.572 --> 00:05.939
HEY, YOU OKAY?

00:05.939 --> 00:07.541
I'VE BEEN BETTER.

00:07.541 --> 00:10.478
MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE THE BOSS
EMBARRASSED YOU LIKE THAT

00:10.478 --> 00:13.714
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY.
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

00:13.714 --> 00:16.184
HEY, SAY NO MORE.
OOH, IT'S ALMOST SHOWTIME.

00:16.184 --> 00:17.818
CAN I HAVE A BEER,
PLEASE?

00:17.818 --> 00:19.220
HEY, VERONICA.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.622
ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA
STOP YOU RIGHT THERE.

00:21.622 --> 00:24.625
THIS IS THE LAST TIME
I'M GONNA TELL YOU, ERNIE.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.794
I AM NOT GOING OUT
WITH YOU.

00:26.794 --> 00:30.231
I'M NOT ATTRACTED TO YOU.
GET OVER ME.

00:30.231 --> 00:34.034
CHALE,
I'M NOT HERE FOR YOU.

00:35.236 --> 00:38.272
I'M HERE TO MEET A BLIND DATE,
CONCEITED.

00:38.272 --> 00:40.274
GEORGE,
THAT'S WHY I'M WEARING

00:40.274 --> 00:42.776
MY LUCKY JACKET
FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

00:42.776 --> 00:45.813
Ã³RALE, RHYTHM NATION.
WHAT'S WITH THE SHOULDER PADS?

00:45.813 --> 00:48.649
DID JANET JACKSON
HAVE A GARAGE SALE?

00:53.654 --> 00:55.656
(chuckles) NO,
I'M WEARING THIS JACKET

00:55.656 --> 00:58.126
BECAUSE IT MAKES
MY SHOULDERS LOOK GOOD.

00:58.126 --> 01:00.161
SEE,
WE MET ON THE INTERNET,

01:00.161 --> 01:03.497
AND I MIGHT HAVE
EXAGGERATED MY BUILD.

01:03.497 --> 01:06.700
INTERNET THINGS
NEVER WORK OUT IF YOU LIE.

01:06.700 --> 01:11.405
THAT'S WHY I ALWAYS TRY
TO UNDERSELL MYSELF.

01:11.405 --> 01:14.575
HOW?

01:16.177 --> 01:18.712
HEY, GEORGE, KEEP AN EYE OUT
FOR A BOMBSHELL.

01:18.712 --> 01:21.715
SHE'S CARRYING A FLOWER,
JUST LIKE ME.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.588
OH, ERNIE,

01:27.588 --> 01:30.524
SOMEONE STOLE
YOUR BOMBSHELL'S FLOWER

01:30.524 --> 01:34.895
AND--AND GAVE IT
TO THAT BIG CHICK.

01:34.895 --> 01:38.098
I THINK
SHE LOOKS NICE.

01:39.733 --> 01:42.436
THAT'S THE RIGHT ATTITUDE.
SHE'S IN YOUR LEAGUE.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.606
THIS IS YOUR SHOT, ERNIE.
STEP UP TO THE PLATE.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.575
BEFORE
SHE LICKS IT CLEAN.

01:47.575 --> 01:49.042
MOM.

01:49.042 --> 01:50.944
HI, HELEN.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.846
IT'S ME, ERNIE.

01:52.846 --> 01:56.184
OH, I'M NOT HELEN.

01:56.184 --> 01:59.387
SURE YOU ARE.
WE GOT MATCHING ROSES.

01:59.387 --> 02:02.323
NO, I'M HOLDING THIS
FOR HELEN.

02:02.323 --> 02:04.992
SHE'S IN THE BATHROOM.
I'LL GET HER FOR YOU.

02:04.992 --> 02:07.661
NO, LOOK.

02:07.661 --> 02:10.398
I KNOW I'M NOT EXACTLY
WHAT YOU EXPECTED,

02:10.398 --> 02:13.234
BUT I MEANT EVERYTHING I SAID
IN THOSE E-MAILS.

02:13.234 --> 02:15.803
I'M LOOKING
FOR A SOUL MATE.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.771
MY HEART'S AN OPEN BOOK,

02:17.771 --> 02:21.008
AND YOU CAN READ IT
IF YOU LIKE.

02:21.008 --> 02:23.711
THAT IS SO SWEET.

02:23.711 --> 02:25.713
HELEN'S GONNA LOVE
TO HEAR THAT

02:25.713 --> 02:28.216
WHEN SHE COMES OUT
OF THE BATHROOM.

02:28.216 --> 02:31.919
LOOK, THERE SHE IS.

02:31.919 --> 02:33.687
HEY!

02:35.189 --> 02:37.658
GOD,
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.361
IF YOU REALLY
WANT TO CATCH HER,

02:40.361 --> 02:42.196
YOU PROBABLY STILL CAN.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.836
GEORGE,
WHAT AM I DOING WRONG?

02:48.836 --> 02:50.338
WELL, FOR STARTERS,

02:50.338 --> 02:53.341
YOU GOTTA STOP
WITH THE "SOUL MATE" CRAP.

02:53.341 --> 02:58.512
SOMETIMES A GAL JUST WANTS
A MAN TO BE A MAN.

02:58.512 --> 03:01.249
SHE WANTS A PAIR
OF BIG, STRONG ARMS

03:01.249 --> 03:03.584
TO WRAP AROUND HER

03:03.584 --> 03:06.354
AND SWEEP HER
OFF HER FEET.

03:06.354 --> 03:08.722
OKAY, WHAT THE HELL?

03:08.722 --> 03:11.359
LET'S GO BACK
TO MY PLACE, GINA.

03:11.359 --> 03:15.563
OH, OH, NO, GOD, NO.

03:15.563 --> 03:17.931
NO, I WASN'T
TALKING ABOUT ME.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.500
WHY NOT?

03:19.500 --> 03:22.603
DUDE, THE COBRA
DOESN'T WANT TO BITE YOU.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.905
WALK AWAY.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.707
NO, GINA, I WANT TO KNOW.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.942
WHY ARE YOU
TURNING ME DOWN?

03:28.942 --> 03:31.279
YOU'RE NOT MY TYPE.

03:31.279 --> 03:34.815
I'M A MAN,
AND I HAVE A PULSE.

03:34.815 --> 03:38.386
WELL, I GUESS THAT MEANS
THAT I HAVE STANDARDS.

03:38.386 --> 03:40.721
I'M AS SURPRISED
AS YOU ARE.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.290
ERNIE.

03:42.290 --> 03:43.824
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.994
MESCAL, OBIE.
KEEP IT COMING.

03:46.994 --> 03:49.797
(cell phone rings)

03:49.797 --> 03:52.866
ANGIE.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.735
DATE NIGHT?

03:54.735 --> 03:58.339
OF COURSE I DIDN'T FORGET
THAT WAS TONIGHT.

03:58.339 --> 04:02.009
I TREASURE OUR "US TIME."

04:02.009 --> 04:03.677
LOOK, I HAD A HORRIBLE DAY.

04:03.677 --> 04:06.480
I'M--I'M STILL STUCK AT WORK
WITH ERNIE.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.949
WHY CAN'T I FIND A WOMAN
TO LOVE ME?

04:08.949 --> 04:13.020
ERNIE, STOP YELLING THAT
INTO THE LADIES' ROOM.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.955
THAT'S SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.660
I'LL SEE YOU SOON, BABY.

04:19.660 --> 04:22.663
I HAVE TO GO. YOU GONNA
BE OKAY HERE BY YOURSELF?

04:22.663 --> 04:24.965
WHY NOT?
I'M USED TO BEING BY MYSELF.

04:24.965 --> 04:27.768
I MIGHT AS WELL FACE THE FACT
THAT I'M PROBABLY GONNA

04:27.768 --> 04:29.903
BE BY MYSELF
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

04:29.903 --> 04:33.841
I'M GONNA DIE
IN MY APARTMENT, ALONE.
OKAY, DUDE, TAKE IT EASY.

04:41.682 --> 04:44.685
I'M SO SORRY I HAD
TO WORK THROUGH DATE NIGHT.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.720
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I MISSED MY CHANCE

04:46.720 --> 04:49.990
TO GO OUT WITH SOMEONE
WHO LOOKS AS AMAZING AS YOU DO.

04:49.990 --> 04:53.727
YOU THINK IT'S OKAY
TO JUST LEAVE ME HERE

04:53.727 --> 04:56.163
SO YOU CAN GO OUT
DRINKING WITH THE GUYS?

04:56.163 --> 04:58.832
AND WE'RE OFF.

04:58.832 --> 05:01.835
LOOK, I TOLD YOU
I HAD TO WORK.

05:01.835 --> 05:04.872
I CALLED THE FACTORY FIRST.
THEY SAID YOU WENT TO THIRSTY'S.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.143
MAYBE I TOLD THEM
TO TELL YOU THAT

05:10.143 --> 05:14.047
BECAUSE I WAS OUT BUYING
YOU A GIFT FOR OUR DATE NIGHT.

05:14.047 --> 05:15.916
YEAH? WHERE IS IT?

05:15.916 --> 05:19.987
UH, IT'S ON BACK ORDER.
IT'LL BE HERE IN A WEEK.

05:19.987 --> 05:24.458
GEORGE, HOW COULD YOU FORGET
ABOUT OUR DATE NIGHT?

05:24.458 --> 05:27.695
BECAUSE I HAD
A HORRIBLE DAY AT WORK.

05:27.695 --> 05:30.698
JACK HUMILIATED ME IN FRONT
OF ALL THE OTHER WORKERS.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.500
ANGIE, I JUST WANTED
TO GET A BEER

05:32.500 --> 05:34.067
AND FORGET ABOUT IT,
OKAY?

05:34.067 --> 05:36.504
WHAT DID HE DO?
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

05:36.504 --> 05:39.106
WHY NOT?
BECAUSE I DON'T.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.709
WHEN I HAVE A BAD DAY,

05:41.709 --> 05:44.945
I CAN'T WAIT TO COME HOME
AND SHARE EVERYTHING WITH YOU.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.181
I KNOW. THAT'S WHY--

05:48.181 --> 05:51.018
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED?
YOU NEED A GIRLFRIEND.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.823
WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT NICE LADY
FROM THE CHURCH

05:55.823 --> 05:58.759
THAT YOU WERE
HANGING OUT WITH?

05:58.759 --> 06:02.062
SHE HAD A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.
SHE'S IN A MENTAL HOSPITAL.

06:02.062 --> 06:06.400
REALLY? I'M SURE
IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

06:08.636 --> 06:10.671
GEORGE,
WE NEED DATE NIGHT

06:10.671 --> 06:12.973
SO WE CAN COMMUNICATE
WITH EACH OTHER.

06:12.973 --> 06:15.709
IF YOU DON'T TALK
ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS,

06:15.709 --> 06:18.712
HOW CAN YOU REALLY
DEAL WITH THEM?

06:18.712 --> 06:20.681
YOU CAN'T JUST
KEEP STUFF INSIDE.

06:20.681 --> 06:23.751
YES, I CAN,
BECAUSE THAT'S THE LOPEZ WAY.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.753
WE BURY THINGS
SO DEEP INSIDE,

06:25.753 --> 06:27.755
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHERE THEY WENT...

06:27.755 --> 06:31.124
UNTIL ONE DAY
YOUR WIFE GETS YOU A MASSAGE

06:31.124 --> 06:32.626
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY,

06:32.626 --> 06:36.997
THE LADY SQUEEZES YOUR FOOT,
AND YOU JUST START CRYING.

06:39.800 --> 06:44.237
YOU SAID SHE HIT A BONE SPUR
AND IT REALLY HURT YOU.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.675
YOU LIMPED FOR TWO WEEKS.
DID YOU FAKE THAT?

06:47.675 --> 06:51.712
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

06:51.712 --> 06:53.013
AY.

06:54.548 --> 06:57.250
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THAT.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.788
ANGIE, BECAUSE IF I TELL YOU,
YOU JUST WON'T LET IT GO.

07:00.788 --> 07:03.056
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU.
LOOK,
I DON'T NEED HELP, OKAY?

07:03.056 --> 07:06.460
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO
OPEN UP IF I DON'T WANT TO.

07:06.460 --> 07:09.630
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
I'M GOING TO THIRSTY'S.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.532
OH, NO, YOU'RE NOT.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.567
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED AT WORK ANYMORE.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.368
THIS IS ABOUT
OUR RELATIONSHIP

07:15.368 --> 07:18.739
AND WHETHER WE HAVE THE INTIMACY
TO SHARE OUR FEELINGS,

07:18.739 --> 07:23.343
OR WHETHER YOU TAKE A BIG STEP
BACKWARD IN OUR MARRIAGE

07:23.343 --> 07:25.913
AND GO HAVE A BEER.

07:31.852 --> 07:35.856
MY VOWS WERE TO LOVE,
HONOR AND CHERISH YOU.

07:35.856 --> 07:38.058
I DON'T HAVE
TO TELL YOU NOTHING.

07:38.058 --> 07:41.428
GEORGE!

07:41.428 --> 07:43.631
DON'T YOU
WALK OUT THAT DOOR.

07:43.631 --> 07:47.067
YOU ARE GONNA STAY,
AND WE'RE GONNA TALK.
WHY, SO YOU CAN
BREAK MY MIND

07:47.067 --> 07:50.370
LIKE THAT NICE CHURCH LADY
YOU DESTROYED?

07:50.370 --> 07:52.272
I DON'T THINK SO.

07:52.272 --> 07:55.208
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

07:58.445 --> 08:01.649
* ALL MY FRIENDS

08:01.649 --> 08:03.150
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

08:03.150 --> 08:06.053
**

08:14.494 --> 08:17.197
SAVE SOME OF THAT FOR ME.

08:17.197 --> 08:19.099
HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

08:19.099 --> 08:20.901
ANGIE AND I HAD A FIGHT.

08:20.901 --> 08:24.838
WHY DO WOMEN HAVE TO TALK
EVERYTHING TO DEATH?

08:24.838 --> 08:28.508
WELL, I DECIDED
I'M GIVING UP ON WOMEN.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.310
YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES I THINK

08:30.310 --> 08:33.380
MY LIFE WOULD BE EASIER
IF I WAS GAY.

08:33.380 --> 08:34.882
YEAH.

08:34.882 --> 08:37.050
NO TALKING, NO CUDDLING--

08:37.050 --> 08:41.121
JUST DO YOUR BUSINESS
AND TURN ON SportsCenter.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.624
YOU THINK THAT'S HOW
GAY GUYS DO IT?

08:43.624 --> 08:45.693
THAT'S HOW I'D DO IT,
MAN.

08:47.728 --> 08:50.130
DUDE,
YOU JUST DRANK THE WORM.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.966
THE LAST TIME YOU DID THAT
YOU HALLUCINATED.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.467
I DON'T CARE.

08:54.467 --> 08:56.403
MAYBE I WANT TO HALLUCINATE,

08:56.403 --> 08:58.906
GO TO THE REALMS OF MY MIND...

08:58.906 --> 09:00.908
WHERE I'M NOT MARRIED
TO A WOMAN

09:00.908 --> 09:03.110
WHO'S GOT TO TALK
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.444
(sighs)

09:04.444 --> 09:07.347
ANYTHING HAPPENING?

09:07.347 --> 09:08.616
NO.

09:11.351 --> 09:14.254
WELL, JUST LET ME KNOW
IF YOU START FEELING WEIRD.

09:14.254 --> 09:17.257
OKAY.

09:19.593 --> 09:23.664
WERE YOU WEARING THAT
WHEN I CAME IN HERE?

09:23.664 --> 09:25.198
GEORGE.

09:25.198 --> 09:26.634
GEORGE.

09:26.634 --> 09:29.102
GEORGE.

09:29.102 --> 09:32.072
GEORGE, GEORGE, GEORGE,
WAKE UP.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.875
YOU'RE MISSING A GREAT GAME.
S.C. IS ABOUT TO SCORE.

09:34.875 --> 09:37.244
SORRY, MAN.
I MUST HAVE DOZED OFF.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.947
YEAH, HEY, DUDE,
HAND ME THAT "TV GUIDE."

09:39.947 --> 09:43.216
I WANT TO SEE WHO'S PLAYING
IN THE NEXT GAME.

09:57.197 --> 10:00.067
WHAT'D YOU DO THAT FOR?
THEY DIDN'T SCORE.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.802
I KNOW.

10:05.572 --> 10:08.308
HERE, GUYS. TRY THESE.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.211
MMM.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.946
THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.282
YEAH,
THESE ARE FABULOUS.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.886
FINALLY.

10:18.886 --> 10:21.689
YOU TWO ARE THE TOUGHEST
CUSTOMERS I'VE EVER HAD.

10:21.689 --> 10:25.125
WELL, WE JUST WANT EVERYTHING TO
BE PERFECT FOR OUR SPECIAL DAY.

10:25.125 --> 10:28.328
I MEAN, WE'RE ONLY
GETTING MARRIED ONCE.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.430
RIGHT, BABY?

10:30.430 --> 10:32.733
HEY, MAN, STOP IT.

10:32.733 --> 10:35.502
OH, SOMEBODY
CALL SNOW WHITE,

10:35.502 --> 10:38.138
BECAUSE GRUMPY'S
ON MY COUCH.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.241
WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN?

10:41.241 --> 10:43.643
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
GETTING MARRIED?

10:43.643 --> 10:46.379
HE'S ALWAYS A LITTLE LOOPY
WHEN HE GETS UP FROM A NAP.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.083
IF YOU BACK OUT
OF OUR WEDDING NOW,

10:50.083 --> 10:51.885
I'M GONNA KEEP THE ENGAGEMENT
RING YOU GOT ME.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.687
ENGAGEMENT RING? WHAT?

10:53.687 --> 10:55.689
DON'T BE MODEST.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

10:55.689 --> 10:57.390
MIRA.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.529
I AM SO GLAD
YOU LOVE IT.

11:02.529 --> 11:03.964
MM.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.966
I HELPED GEORGE
PICK IT OUT.

11:05.966 --> 11:09.269
IT LOOKED GOOD ON MY FINGER,
TOO. (chuckles)

11:09.269 --> 11:12.706
(sobbing) WHY CAN'T I
GET A MAN?

11:16.376 --> 11:17.911
SO THIS IS REAL?

11:19.479 --> 11:22.215
THIS IS MY LIFE?

11:30.290 --> 11:33.460
WE'RE ACTUALLY ENGAGED,
AND WE'RE GETTING MARRIED?

11:33.460 --> 11:36.997
YEAH, AND WHEN WE'RE MARRIED,
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT

11:36.997 --> 11:39.466
BECAUSE IT'S GONNA
BE LIKE THIS EVERY DAY.

11:39.466 --> 11:44.337
Â¿SABES QUÃ©? FOOTBALL,
BEER AND BEST BUDS.

11:45.672 --> 11:48.708
I GUESS I COULD
GET USED TO THAT.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.844
THAT'S MY MAN.

11:55.615 --> 11:59.920
BUT THAT'S GONNA
TAKE SOME TIME.

12:06.593 --> 12:09.162
GEORGE,
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.730
I HAVE TO MEASURE YOU
FOR YOUR TUX.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.633
OH, I KNOW HIS INSEAM, BUT MAYBE
I BETTER DOUBLE-CHECK IT.

12:13.633 --> 12:17.037
NOT NOW, MAN.
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD.

12:17.037 --> 12:20.273
WELL, MARK THE DAY.

12:21.809 --> 12:23.977
I CAN'T ALWAYS
BE IN THE MOOD.

12:26.613 --> 12:29.016
I TELL YOU WHAT.

12:29.016 --> 12:31.718
WE'LL DOUBLE UP
TOMORROW NIGHT.

12:31.718 --> 12:34.021
OKAY.

12:34.021 --> 12:37.190
LOOK, UH,
LET'S GET YOU MEASURED, MM?

12:37.190 --> 12:39.326
CAN WE DO IT LATER?
I HAD A BAD DAY AT WORK.

12:39.326 --> 12:42.329
WHAT HAPPENED?
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

12:42.329 --> 12:44.664
WELL, LET'S JUST
WATCH THE GAME THEN.

12:44.664 --> 12:47.434
USUALLY, I FEEL BETTER
IF I TALK THINGS OUT.

12:47.434 --> 12:51.771
TALKING DOESN'T MAKE US
FEEL BETTER, OKAY?

12:53.106 --> 12:55.708
WATCHING SPORTS DOES.

12:55.708 --> 12:57.911
THAT'S
THE CARDENAS-LOPEZ WAY.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.348
LOPEZ-CARDENAS?

13:01.348 --> 13:02.782
LET'S GO, BABY.

13:10.190 --> 13:13.393
OH. MAN. HE'S GONNA
GO ALL THE WAY. GO!

13:13.393 --> 13:15.328
GO! GO!

13:15.328 --> 13:17.898
YES. TOUCHDOWN!
(laughs)

13:21.334 --> 13:24.204
DUDE, THEY SCORED.
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

13:24.204 --> 13:27.507
WHAT HAPPENED AT WORK
IS STILL BOTHERING ME.

13:27.507 --> 13:31.211
FORGET ABOUT IT.
THAT'S WHY WE WATCH THE GAME.

13:31.211 --> 13:33.213
I CAN'T BELIEVE JACK
HUMILIATED ME

13:33.213 --> 13:36.116
IN FRONT
OF ALL THE WORKERS LIKE THAT.

13:36.116 --> 13:39.452
OH, LOOK AT THAT TRAINER
RUBBING TOM BRADY'S THIGH.

13:43.523 --> 13:47.360
I SHOULD HAVE NEVER DROPPED OUT
OF MASSAGE SCHOOL.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.262
DID YOU HEAR
A WORD I SAID?

13:49.262 --> 13:50.931
HUSH. I WANT TO SEE THIS.

13:50.931 --> 13:54.034
DON'T HUSH ME.
IF I WANT TO TALK, I'LL TALK.

13:54.034 --> 13:56.569
AT LEAST SAVE IT
UNTIL HALFTIME.

13:56.569 --> 13:58.471
YEAH, RIGHT.

13:58.471 --> 14:01.474
LIKE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO LISTEN
WHEN YOU SEE TROY AIKMAN

14:01.474 --> 14:04.477
DRAWING Xs AND Os
ON THE SCREEN.

14:04.477 --> 14:07.780
YOU KNOW, THOSE AREN'T
HUGS AND KISSES FOR YOU.

14:07.780 --> 14:10.283
WELL, THERE'S A TV
IN THE BEDROOM.

14:10.283 --> 14:13.253
MAYBE I SHOULD GO UP THERE
AND WATCH THE GAME.

14:13.253 --> 14:16.123
MAYBE YOU SHOULD BECAUSE
NOTHING ELSE IS HAPPENING

14:16.123 --> 14:17.590
IN THAT BEDROOM TONIGHT.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.465
YOU WANT TO DO
THAT MEASUREMENT NOW?

14:25.465 --> 14:27.968
YEAH, LET'S JUST
GET IT OVER WITH.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.503
OKAY.

14:30.503 --> 14:34.807
SO WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED
AT WORK?

14:34.807 --> 14:36.509
YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.211
SURE, I DO.

14:38.211 --> 14:42.315
I ORDERED TOO MANY PARTS
BECAUSE OF MY DYSLEXIA.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.417
WELL, THAT SOUNDS LIKE
AN HONEST MISTAKE.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.186
NO, THE BOSS MADE ME
REDO THE NUMBERS

14:46.186 --> 14:48.221
IN FRONT OF ALL THE WORKERS,

14:48.221 --> 14:51.658
AND I FELT LIKE AN IDIOT
ALL OVER AGAIN.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"ALL OVER AGAIN"?

14:51.658 --> 14:53.994
DID SOMEONE ELSE
MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT?

14:53.994 --> 14:55.996
WELL, IN THIRD GRADE,
MRS. HALSTEAD DID,

14:55.996 --> 14:58.065
BUT THIS
IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.566
WHAT DID SHE DO?

14:59.566 --> 15:01.568
I GOT A PROBLEM WRONG
IN MATH CLASS,

15:01.568 --> 15:04.571
AND SHE MADE ME GET UP
AND REDO THE NUMBERS

15:04.571 --> 15:06.906
IN FRONT OF
ALL THE OTHER WORKERS.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.278
I MEAN CLASSMATES.

15:11.278 --> 15:14.514
(effeminate voice)
OH, MY GOD. BREAKTHROUGH.

15:18.851 --> 15:23.456
I BET WHAT HAPPENED AT WORK
AFFECTED YOU SO MUCH

15:23.456 --> 15:26.726
BECAUSE IT MADE YOU
RELIVE A CHILDHOOD TRAUMA.

15:26.726 --> 15:29.429
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.464
YOU JUST HAD TO TALK IT THROUGH
WITH SOMEONE.

15:31.464 --> 15:34.801
YEAH, WELL, ERNIE
NEVER WOULD'VE TAKEN THE TIME

15:34.801 --> 15:36.603
TO HELP ME REALIZE THAT.

15:36.603 --> 15:39.639
ALL HE EVER TALKS ABOUT
ARE SPORTS, HOUSE MUSIC

15:39.639 --> 15:41.441
AND HOW HE WANTS A FREE PASS

15:41.441 --> 15:45.578
IF HE EVER RUNS INTO TRAVOLTA
AT THE YOGURT STAND.

15:47.480 --> 15:52.986
WELL, IF FOR SOME REASON ERNIE
CAN'T BE THERE FOR YOU,

15:52.986 --> 15:54.988
YOU CAN ALWAYS TALK TO ME.

15:54.988 --> 15:56.990
THANKS.

16:16.876 --> 16:20.380
(gasps) AAH!

16:34.961 --> 16:38.331
HOW'S ERNIE DOING?

16:38.331 --> 16:40.867
HE'S OKAY.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

16:40.867 --> 16:43.870
I'M SO GLAD HE DECIDED
TO LET ME COME TO THE WEDDING.

16:43.870 --> 16:47.006
THAT KISS WAS JUST
A STUPID MISTAKE ON MY PART.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.008
(chuckles)
YEAH, I MEAN,

16:49.008 --> 16:53.012
CAN YOU IMAGINE US
ACTUALLY HOOKING UP?

16:53.012 --> 16:55.315
YOUR SOFT SKIN,
LONG HAIR...

16:55.315 --> 16:57.950
AND ALL THOSE CURVES...

16:57.950 --> 16:59.552
NO, THANK YOU.

17:10.963 --> 17:12.532
YOU'RE THE PRIEST?

17:14.234 --> 17:17.036
YOU LOOK EXACTLY
LIKE ANGIE'S DAD VIC.

17:17.036 --> 17:20.507
AND I SOUND LIKE HIM, TOO.
CONFUSING?

17:20.507 --> 17:24.411
THEN DON'T EAT THE WORM,
CHICO.

17:24.411 --> 17:25.778
WHAT?

17:25.778 --> 17:29.116
(Richard Wagner's
"Bridal Chorus" playing)

17:40.693 --> 17:42.295
(mouths words)

17:47.066 --> 17:49.502
OUR GROOMS HAVE WRITTEN
THEIR OWN VOWS,

17:49.502 --> 17:53.606
AND THEY'D LIKE TO SHARE THEM
WITH EVERYONE.

17:53.606 --> 17:54.941
ERNIE,

17:54.941 --> 17:58.145
WHEN YOU SAID YOU WANTED US
TO WRITE OUR OWN VOWS,

17:58.145 --> 17:59.646
I'LL BE HONEST,

17:59.646 --> 18:02.115
I WASN'T
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

18:02.115 --> 18:03.616
(mutters)

18:05.152 --> 18:07.454
IT'S HARD FOR ME
TO LOOK INSIDE...

18:08.988 --> 18:12.091
AND SHARE
WHAT I'M FEELING,

18:12.091 --> 18:15.495
BUT YOU HELP ME DO THAT,

18:15.495 --> 18:20.333
AND AS PAINFUL AS IT IS,
IT MAKES ME A BETTER PERSON...

18:22.269 --> 18:25.305
AND I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR THAT.

18:28.875 --> 18:34.347
WHY YOU LOOKING AT HER?
YOU'RE MARRYING ME.

18:36.048 --> 18:38.117
NO, I'M NOT.

18:38.117 --> 18:41.120
I JUST REALIZED
I CAN'T MARRY YOU.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.490
(whimpers) WHAT?

18:43.490 --> 18:45.792
I WANT TO MARRY SOMEBODY
I CAN TALK TO.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.228
WAIT A MINUTE.

18:48.228 --> 18:51.231
I'M NOT EVEN GAY, MAN.
I LOVE ANGIE.

18:53.032 --> 18:56.969
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?
(sobbing)

18:56.969 --> 19:01.040
BECAUSE HE'S COMING OUT
OF HIS HALLUCINATION.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.376
WHAT HALLUCINATION?

19:03.376 --> 19:07.079
OH, YOU THINK
A DANCING WORM IS NORMAL?

19:07.079 --> 19:08.548
LOOK AT ME.

19:08.548 --> 19:12.319
(dance music playing)

19:17.857 --> 19:22.362
GEORGE, GEORGE, GEORGE,
GEORGE, GEORGE!

19:22.362 --> 19:24.030
I'M AT THIRSTY'S?

19:24.030 --> 19:26.132
WHAT HAPPENED?

19:26.132 --> 19:29.402
I HAD THIS WEIRD HALLUCINATION,

19:29.402 --> 19:32.104
BUT IT HELPED ME
REALIZE SOMETHING.

19:32.104 --> 19:33.973
WHAT?

19:33.973 --> 19:35.775
TALKING TO YOUR WIFE

19:35.775 --> 19:38.311
IS NOT A WASTE OF TIME.

19:40.046 --> 19:41.914
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

19:41.914 --> 19:45.318
EXACTLY, MAN. THAT'S WHY
I'LL NEVER MARRY YOU.

19:45.318 --> 19:49.956
I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT WAS ON THE TABLE.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.962
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WALKED OUT
ON ME LIKE THAT.

19:55.962 --> 19:59.031
WE NEED
TO FINISH TALKING.
I KNOW.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.833
BECAUSE IF
I DON'T TALK TO YOU

20:00.833 --> 20:02.835
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON
IN MY LIFE,

20:02.835 --> 20:04.904
I'LL NEVER
BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH IT.

20:04.904 --> 20:07.907
DON'T JUST SAY
WHAT YOU THINK I WANNA HEAR.

20:07.907 --> 20:10.009
NO, I BELIEVE IT NOW.

20:10.009 --> 20:11.511
ANGIE, LET'S GO HOME,

20:11.511 --> 20:14.046
AND I'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED AT WORK.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.748
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

20:15.748 --> 20:17.149
ABSOLUTELY.

20:17.149 --> 20:18.351
OKAY.

20:18.351 --> 20:21.120
OH, YOU SMELL SO GOOD.

20:21.120 --> 20:24.624
AND BRA STRAPS WHICH MEAN,
HELLO.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.937
YOU KNOW, I FEEL KIND OF BAD
'CAUSE I WAS EAVESDROPPING,

20:37.937 --> 20:40.840
BUT IT WAS NICE OF YOU TO TAKE
CARE OF YOUR FRIEND LIKE THAT.

20:40.840 --> 20:45.077
YEAH, WELL,
THAT'S WHAT GUYS DO.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.380
GOOD GUYS.

20:48.848 --> 20:52.051
YOU KNOW, I GET OFF WORK
IN 20 MINUTES.

20:52.051 --> 20:54.687
ARE YOU... SEEING ANYONE?

20:54.687 --> 20:57.256
NO.

20:57.256 --> 21:00.727
I'VE BEEN KILLING MYSELF
TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT WOMAN

21:00.727 --> 21:03.896
TO START A RELATIONSHIP WITH,
BUT I'M JUST GIVING UP.

21:03.896 --> 21:06.533
I SHOULD JUST GO
FOR A CHEAP ONE-NIGHTER.

21:08.335 --> 21:10.337
YOU KNOW,
YOU'D BE SURPRISED.

21:10.337 --> 21:13.973
SOMETIMES THAT'S ALL
A WOMAN WANTS, TOO.

21:13.973 --> 21:17.510
YEAH? WELL, I'M NEVER
GONNA FIND ONE OF THOSE.

21:17.510 --> 21:20.012
I'M GONNA WALK HOME.
TAKE IT EASY.
