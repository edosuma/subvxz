WEBVTT

02:16.386 --> 02:19.889
<i>Many believe it was</i>
<i>not an accident but an assassination.</i>

02:19.973 --> 02:22.559
<i>The Major General Juvénal Habyarimana</i>

02:22.642 --> 02:25.603
<i>said that the RPF</i>
<i>never abandoned their logic…</i>

02:25.687 --> 02:27.313
<i>The big question is,</i>

02:27.397 --> 02:28.982
<i>who shot down the president's plane,</i>

02:29.065 --> 02:33.111
<i>and how would this turn of events</i>
<i>further destabilize an already fragile…</i>

02:40.451 --> 02:43.037
<i> None of us menstruates anymore.</i>

02:47.041 --> 02:49.544
<i>None of us goes to the bathroom.</i>

02:52.213 --> 02:53.756
<i> I can feel my spirit</i>

02:55.258 --> 02:56.843
<i>eager for the long sleep.</i>

03:00.763 --> 03:02.557
<i>Life leaves my body.</i>

03:04.100 --> 03:05.643
<i>My bones waste away.</i>

03:08.605 --> 03:11.232
<i>We never thought</i>
<i>we'd be in here this long…</i>

03:14.903 --> 03:18.865
<i>but we delay the inevitable.</i>

03:20.783 --> 03:25.413
<i>I am writing this</i>
<i>so that when they find our bodies,</i>

03:25.496 --> 03:27.790
<i>they will know how long we were here.</i>

03:31.085 --> 03:32.587
<i>Have I told you my name?</i>

03:33.796 --> 03:36.591
<i>My name is Annick Irakoze.</i>

03:41.304 --> 03:44.057
Annick!<i> Ma puce!</i>
I have one more.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.272
I will be back soon…

03:51.356 --> 03:54.692
…when it is safe for you
and for him to come out. Hmm?

04:02.325 --> 04:03.284
Right now!

04:03.368 --> 04:04.369
I love you,<i> ma puce.</i>

04:44.284 --> 04:45.660
There were Hutu men

04:47.245 --> 04:50.039
marching across our farm with machetes.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.293
They were covered in blood,

04:54.043 --> 04:57.463
and they were saying, "Tall trees."

04:58.506 --> 05:00.550
"Cut the tall trees."

05:00.633 --> 05:02.885
It's okay. A dream.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.554
-Here.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.472
-Water.

05:07.223 --> 05:08.141
Here.

05:08.224 --> 05:09.642
Angels are with us.

05:11.185 --> 05:12.312
It will end soon.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.188
It will be okay, Mutesi. Hmm?

05:14.814 --> 05:16.941
-Francois--
-How do you know my name?

05:18.443 --> 05:21.321
You told us yesterday when you came.

05:24.615 --> 05:26.909
Francois said he found you
inside the well.

05:28.202 --> 05:31.039
You are Hutu, with child.

05:31.122 --> 05:33.666
-A boy. A Hutu boy who will--

05:34.250 --> 05:36.294
My name is Jeanette. This is Annick.

05:37.211 --> 05:38.254
I am a Hutu

05:39.130 --> 05:40.465
but a moderate.

05:40.548 --> 05:42.383
I may face the same danger.

05:43.051 --> 05:46.304
We are in my home,
beneath the floor of my kitchen.

05:46.387 --> 05:49.349
We built it ourselves.
Good for storing food.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.517
We'll be safest here, a day or so,

05:52.393 --> 05:53.853
until things get better.

05:54.479 --> 05:55.897
But we must be quiet.

06:02.612 --> 06:03.446
I, um…

06:04.072 --> 06:07.200
-I'm… I'm just--
-Peyton. Here from the United States.

06:08.117 --> 06:09.619
A volunteer at Saint Joseph.

06:27.762 --> 06:29.597
Where's the toilet?

06:30.098 --> 06:32.016
It's almost dark.
We can sneak there.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.893
No. The risk is too great.

06:34.394 --> 06:37.230
Then what? Where are we supposed to pee?

06:40.024 --> 06:43.486
-We cannot. We need--
-What? What more can we need?

06:43.569 --> 06:45.780
Francois will give us everything we need.

06:45.863 --> 06:47.073
And it will end.

06:52.370 --> 06:53.246
I'm sorry.

06:55.081 --> 06:55.915
I'm sorry, I…

06:56.416 --> 06:57.834
Where is it?

07:07.593 --> 07:09.053
Do not be afraid.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.308
It locks from the outside.

07:17.145 --> 07:18.187
What does?

07:21.566 --> 07:22.608
This room.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.570
The door.

07:28.531 --> 07:29.657
Don't be afraid.

07:32.410 --> 07:33.786
We are locked in here?

07:34.495 --> 07:35.955
-Mutesi.

07:36.747 --> 07:38.583
-Mutesi!

07:38.666 --> 07:41.711
This room is for storing things,
not intended for people to be inside.

07:44.922 --> 07:46.757
It locks when the door closes.

07:50.094 --> 07:51.554
We are safe.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.389
Francois says it will end quickly.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.558
The UN will come.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.685
Belgian troops are here.

07:59.979 --> 08:03.024
Think about something else.
That's what I'm doing.

08:04.734 --> 08:05.943
Just until tomorrow.

08:18.831 --> 08:20.791
No, no, no. No, no, no.

09:07.713 --> 09:08.839
Mutesi.

09:09.423 --> 09:10.925
-It's okay.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.052
It's okay. It's just me.

09:13.678 --> 09:16.222
Uh, I… I have an idea
for a toilet, for now,

09:16.305 --> 09:18.724
but I… I need your help.

09:18.808 --> 09:21.727
Um, I… I think there's,
like, a hole right here.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.024
We could break it.

09:30.820 --> 09:31.904
Wrap another time.

09:36.784 --> 09:37.618
Pull.

09:49.714 --> 09:51.549
-Do you…
-Uh…

09:52.341 --> 09:53.426
You first.

10:01.767 --> 10:04.312
I could cry right now.

10:18.909 --> 10:19.827
Um…

10:22.955 --> 10:25.708
-Thank you.
-So Francois is your husband?

10:25.791 --> 10:28.711
Five years. But we've known each other
since we were very young.

10:28.794 --> 10:31.964
Almost our whole lives.
We were in primary school when he told me

10:32.965 --> 10:35.551
he had claimed me. I was his.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.681
It is a good thing
you've not had a child yet.

10:41.641 --> 10:45.019
Times like these,
he'd be out there chopping his friends.

10:45.102 --> 10:47.396
Maybe he would chop you.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.737
-What about you, Peyton?

10:55.237 --> 10:56.572
What brought you here?

10:57.156 --> 11:00.284
-Uh… Peace Projects.
-Yes.

11:00.868 --> 11:02.161
That we can see.

11:02.244 --> 11:03.621
What is the reason?

11:04.830 --> 11:06.332
Mmm, no reason.

11:30.356 --> 11:33.401
How do you be a nun

11:33.484 --> 11:34.902
in this world?

11:37.029 --> 11:38.030
Well, child,

11:38.739 --> 11:40.324
God is not of this world.

11:40.908 --> 11:43.452
He created it, but he is not of it.

11:43.536 --> 11:48.332
But all we really know
is what we can see, right?

11:48.416 --> 11:52.420
What we can physically feel, you know?
And anything can change, just like that.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.340
One thing happens, and…

11:58.008 --> 11:59.719
it changes everything else.

12:00.302 --> 12:02.012
The world does seem that way.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.057
You never know what is coming next.

12:05.141 --> 12:10.062
And… right when you think you do,
it's completely something else.

12:10.146 --> 12:12.398
That is why you have no children?

12:12.481 --> 12:14.859
I assume they'd be here, not us.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.321
Children have not been
in God's plan for us.

12:20.614 --> 12:22.116
We have not been able to.

12:26.495 --> 12:27.747
It will happen.

12:30.124 --> 12:33.252
You've had miscarriages?

12:37.339 --> 12:38.257
Four.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.224
M… miscarriages?

12:51.645 --> 12:52.480
This time…

12:54.356 --> 12:55.608
this boy is the one.

13:19.757 --> 13:21.091
Hey, hey, come on now.

13:22.051 --> 13:24.637
Christophe
is going to stomp you so bad later.

13:24.720 --> 13:25.763
Christophe is gone.

13:25.846 --> 13:27.765
-Pop says for good.
-Gone?

13:27.848 --> 13:29.850
Where? Why?

13:29.934 --> 13:31.727
Because
Christophe was a cockroach.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.646
Hey! What are you doing?

13:34.605 --> 13:36.273
Identity card! Now!

13:38.818 --> 13:40.277
I don't have it.

13:40.945 --> 13:43.197
-We are Hutu, I swear.
-Shut up!

13:44.615 --> 13:45.491
Yes.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.993
Your father is Godefroid, no?

13:48.077 --> 13:49.203
You know Papa?

13:51.872 --> 13:52.790
Football?

13:53.833 --> 13:55.417
This is not the time for games.

13:56.001 --> 13:57.795
-You proud to be Hutu, boys?
-Yes.

13:57.878 --> 14:01.173
This place, this land,
is your birthright.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.842
Not them cockroaches!

14:04.009 --> 14:05.970
And you, you are old enough.

14:07.054 --> 14:09.098
You should have
your identity card everywhere you go!

14:09.181 --> 14:10.057
Yes, sir.

14:10.140 --> 14:12.309
Don't you want it known
you are the better race?

14:14.812 --> 14:17.231
This is the time for cleansing!

14:18.315 --> 14:19.567
Play your part, brother.

14:24.655 --> 14:25.823
The penalty today is one ball.

14:25.906 --> 14:26.740
Go!

14:26.824 --> 14:27.658
Get the ball.

14:27.741 --> 14:28.909
Run!

14:44.925 --> 14:47.553
Hey, hey!
What are you doing over there?

14:53.976 --> 14:54.852
Nice ball.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.606
You two, go home.

14:58.689 --> 15:01.150
-You, brother, come with me.

15:01.233 --> 15:02.151
Come!

15:09.825 --> 15:11.243
So we clap first,

15:11.827 --> 15:13.913
and then the right hand
meets once in the middle,

15:14.455 --> 15:15.372
and then the left.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.709
-Yes.
-Oh, I know this game.

15:20.794 --> 15:22.922
-Oh my gosh, you're good.

15:26.467 --> 15:29.011
I'm serious.
This is not a time for games.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.721
What else are we supposed to do?

15:32.765 --> 15:37.102
Bubblegum, bubblegum in a dish.

15:37.186 --> 15:41.190
How many pieces do you wish?

15:42.024 --> 15:43.442
Mutesi, how many pieces?

15:44.693 --> 15:46.403
Oh. Um…

15:47.821 --> 15:48.697
Nine.

15:49.406 --> 15:52.993
One, two, three, four, five,

15:53.077 --> 15:56.246
six, seven, eight, nine.

15:56.330 --> 15:59.541
And you are not it.

16:01.085 --> 16:03.462
-Annick, you're not it.

16:03.545 --> 16:05.798
-Oh, oh, oh.
-Take your foot out.

16:06.423 --> 16:07.508
Oh.

16:07.591 --> 16:10.260
So, what happens when you're it?

16:10.344 --> 16:12.638
Well, whoever's it has to chase…

16:14.515 --> 16:17.434
Whoever is it has to…

16:17.518 --> 16:19.019
I declare thumb war.

16:19.103 --> 16:22.022
Five, six, seven, eight,
try to keep your thumbs straight.

16:30.447 --> 16:32.116
I've got you.

17:38.724 --> 17:41.226
A woman is hiding.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.394
A woman is hiding.

17:47.941 --> 17:48.984
She can join us.

17:49.610 --> 17:50.569
We can call to her.

17:50.652 --> 17:52.738
No, no, no, no. It's unsafe.

17:52.821 --> 17:55.574
-We cannot leave her.
-Not with our voices.

17:55.657 --> 17:58.368
We could throw something out there,
get her attention.

18:03.290 --> 18:06.126
I don't care if it tastes like piss,

18:06.710 --> 18:08.087
as long as it gets me drunk.

18:10.547 --> 18:12.466
I know him. Pascal.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.343
A member of our church.

18:14.426 --> 18:15.719
He will help her.

18:16.470 --> 18:17.596
Thank you, Jesus.

18:17.679 --> 18:18.680
He's Hutu?

18:19.181 --> 18:20.974
Yes, but like you.

18:21.725 --> 18:24.686
You cannot trust him,
no matter how well you know him.

18:24.770 --> 18:25.604
No.

18:26.271 --> 18:27.231
I know this boy.

18:28.649 --> 18:29.483
Trust me.

18:30.317 --> 18:31.235
Trust in God.

18:32.319 --> 18:34.279
-I'll call to him.
-Jeanette!

18:35.155 --> 18:36.323
Francois will come.

18:36.406 --> 18:38.450
Look here, a cockroach!

18:38.534 --> 18:40.369
A cockroach.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.205
-Come, come. Move.
-No!

18:44.790 --> 18:46.667
Bring her along quick.

18:46.750 --> 18:48.418
Let's get this over with.

18:48.502 --> 18:51.421
This will end
easy and painless for you

18:51.505 --> 18:52.798
if you tell us now.

18:53.715 --> 18:55.884
Ah, you think we won't find them?

18:56.385 --> 18:57.511
We found you.

18:57.594 --> 18:59.721
It is my job to hunt them down.

19:00.222 --> 19:02.933
-If you won't tell us, well…
-We all scattered so fast.

19:03.016 --> 19:04.852
Ah! Like cockroaches?

19:06.645 --> 19:09.773
You do not want
to feel this in your flesh.

19:10.983 --> 19:15.028
You don't want your husband
or your children to feel it either.

19:16.446 --> 19:19.366
If you tell us where they are,
they won't have to.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.828
I will feed them each a bullet instead.

19:22.911 --> 19:25.247
-Come, come, come.
-Please.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.624
-You can stop this, please.
-Oh, shut up!

19:29.793 --> 19:31.753
You know, you really are a bitch!

19:31.837 --> 19:32.713
Begging.

19:33.463 --> 19:36.592
And those ugly children, like an ugly dog.

19:36.675 --> 19:37.676
Look at me!

19:39.428 --> 19:40.971
You fucking cockroach.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.850
I say
she's more like a fat fucking cow

19:44.933 --> 19:46.727
ready to push out another one, eh?

19:46.810 --> 19:49.813
Where are you going, huh?
Where are you going? Huh?

19:49.897 --> 19:52.566
-Take her over there!
-Oh God, no! No!

19:53.150 --> 19:55.194
-No!
-Oh, shut up!

19:55.277 --> 19:57.738
-I'll teach this one a lesson.
-No!

19:57.821 --> 19:59.656
No! No!

20:01.158 --> 20:03.035
No! No!

20:03.118 --> 20:04.578
Shut up! Shut up!

20:05.078 --> 20:06.330
No!

20:08.123 --> 20:09.791
No! No!

20:10.918 --> 20:14.588
-No!

20:31.188 --> 20:33.023
It's your turn, brother.

20:33.523 --> 20:34.524
I will hold her.

20:39.571 --> 20:43.784
Where are your cockroaches?

20:43.867 --> 20:45.452
You will rot in hell for this!

20:45.535 --> 20:47.412
-You will rot in hell--

21:36.253 --> 21:37.379
Dogs.

21:38.255 --> 21:39.089
Are they…

21:45.345 --> 21:48.890
It was Akimana Murenzi.

21:50.183 --> 21:52.561
She and her husband ran the main bakery.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.522
And the two who killed her…

21:56.148 --> 21:58.108
…they were still practically boys.

21:58.900 --> 22:01.111
Pascal, he used to sing in the choir.

22:01.695 --> 22:05.032
He had the most beautiful voice.

22:05.115 --> 22:06.742
You did this.

22:06.825 --> 22:08.368
You didn't want her here.

22:08.452 --> 22:10.329
She's dead because of you.

22:10.412 --> 22:13.665
-No, we are alive because of her.
-She was… She was…

22:15.292 --> 22:16.877
She was pregnant.

22:17.377 --> 22:19.629
Why didn't you say she was pregnant?

22:19.713 --> 22:23.717
That would have made the difference?
Only women who bear children matter?

22:24.384 --> 22:27.095
-The rest are not worth your mercy?
-She has been merciful.

22:27.179 --> 22:28.889
This is about God's mercy.

22:28.972 --> 22:31.808
-There was nothing--
-Do not touch me!

22:32.517 --> 22:34.436
We only listened to her.

22:34.519 --> 22:36.688
-Only listened.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.567
They would never kill a precious American.

22:40.650 --> 22:42.569
Akimana should have been in this room.

22:42.652 --> 22:44.613
No, no. Shh. This is not God's truth.

22:44.696 --> 22:45.947
Francois will help us.

22:46.031 --> 22:50.660
-I know it is hard.
-Are you mad or stupid?

22:51.370 --> 22:53.997
Your husband is surely dead.

22:54.790 --> 22:57.250
We must have faith and pray.

22:57.334 --> 22:58.710
Pray to who?

22:59.920 --> 23:01.129
Who is listening?

23:01.213 --> 23:03.298
The Lord Jesus is always listening.

23:03.382 --> 23:06.718
People are being slaughtered
like sows in the street, and for what?

23:06.802 --> 23:08.970
God listens to us all.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.972
He may not always give us the answer--

23:11.056 --> 23:13.683
Like sows in the street!

23:15.560 --> 23:16.770
Your make-believe is over.

23:16.853 --> 23:19.773
People who have killed will have to answer
for their transgressions

23:19.856 --> 23:21.108
on the Day of Judgment.

23:21.191 --> 23:23.610
This is their judgment.

23:24.694 --> 23:25.529
Right now.

23:26.029 --> 23:27.322
What they did,

23:27.406 --> 23:28.949
no woman…

23:30.951 --> 23:35.414
should ever have to suffer that.

23:43.672 --> 23:48.468
At night, my uncle would…

23:59.521 --> 24:00.730
I am sorry.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.024
I know what that is like.

24:04.568 --> 24:06.319
My father, he would…

24:10.615 --> 24:13.201
He would hurt my mother
that way sometimes.

24:15.370 --> 24:18.957
He would force himself on her.

24:23.128 --> 24:24.671
I'll kill those fucking dogs.

24:25.255 --> 24:26.798
Your people started this.

24:27.674 --> 24:30.385
White man came, said, "Identity cards."

24:30.469 --> 24:33.805
Said, "Hutu get this,"
said, "Tutsi get that."

24:37.809 --> 24:39.728
-Shut up!

24:49.196 --> 24:50.780
Look into my eyes

24:51.490 --> 24:55.118
and tell me that those boys
do not deserve to suffer in hell.

24:56.953 --> 24:57.954
Do it.

24:58.038 --> 24:58.872
Do it.

24:59.456 --> 25:01.333
Pass judgment onto those pigs.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.543
I never dare judge anyone.

25:04.044 --> 25:05.212
Why is that?

25:05.295 --> 25:08.632
Because you'd have to judge your father
for being a pig?

25:10.634 --> 25:12.886
And perhaps Akimana
should have been in here,

25:13.678 --> 25:14.804
and you out there.

25:25.190 --> 25:26.399
Enough of this.

25:29.194 --> 25:30.904
Akimana is with the Lord now.

25:33.323 --> 25:34.199
Let us pray.

25:35.450 --> 25:36.493
Heavenly Father,

25:37.661 --> 25:40.080
we pray for the soul of Akimana Murenzi.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.250
May you keep her, Lord.

25:44.626 --> 25:45.627
May you keep her.

26:01.017 --> 26:02.477
Those men knew her.

26:05.313 --> 26:07.399
They knew she had children missing.

26:07.983 --> 26:08.817
Hidden.

26:09.693 --> 26:12.112
-Why would you hide us?

26:12.779 --> 26:16.491
When the violence broke out,
the militia was pillaging homes.

26:16.992 --> 26:19.160
Francois says they have lists of names.

26:19.869 --> 26:22.163
Names of Tutsi and of Hutu moderates.

26:23.331 --> 26:27.961
Francois is a teacher at a school
for the education of both Tutsi and Hutu.

26:29.754 --> 26:32.299
We never believed
Tutsi were better than us,

26:33.508 --> 26:35.635
no matter what prejudice you've seen

26:35.719 --> 26:38.054
or what you were told as children.

26:39.389 --> 26:41.891
No person is better than any other.

26:44.102 --> 26:47.022
And we must love ourselves
to be able to love each other.

26:50.609 --> 26:53.445
You were a lonely little girl.

26:58.742 --> 27:00.410
You think you're so smart.

27:03.747 --> 27:06.833
You only listen to judge and not hear.

27:08.251 --> 27:11.296
You are right.
I… I was a lonely little girl.

27:13.131 --> 27:14.090
But I see…

27:16.635 --> 27:17.719
you still are.

28:25.787 --> 28:28.623
What are you doing? What is this?

28:29.457 --> 28:32.877
You hide food from us,
and you have it all for yourself.

28:32.961 --> 28:34.671
-No!
-What else?

28:36.798 --> 28:38.717
-Mutesi!

28:38.800 --> 28:41.469
Stop! She came to feed the poor Africans.

28:41.553 --> 28:42.929
I came to teach.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.849
Mutesi,
this is not for you to-- Stop this!

28:45.932 --> 28:47.517
-This is not--
-She was letting us starve!

28:47.600 --> 28:49.436
No, I was saving it, in case…

28:50.562 --> 28:52.605
What if we're in here for a while?

28:52.689 --> 28:55.275
I… I was going to share the food. I was.

28:55.358 --> 28:57.235
No, you keep it.

28:57.318 --> 28:59.612
I don't need your disgusting food.

29:06.953 --> 29:07.787
It's just,

29:08.788 --> 29:12.208
there's no way to know
if Francois is coming back.

29:12.292 --> 29:14.919
So if… if this is all we have, then…

29:20.633 --> 29:22.427
We are all starving.

29:22.927 --> 29:24.512
Just eat. Here.

29:36.941 --> 29:39.402
Father, bless this food.
Forgive us our trespasses…

29:52.123 --> 29:54.417
-Open up.

29:56.419 --> 29:57.587
-Wake…

29:58.254 --> 29:59.172
Caleb.

30:01.090 --> 30:02.550
Wake… Hmm.

30:09.682 --> 30:11.100
Why are you not asleep?

30:13.353 --> 30:14.813
Can I make a confession?

30:15.396 --> 30:16.856
I am not a priest.

30:21.319 --> 30:22.153
Yes.

30:23.947 --> 30:25.031
Make your confession.

30:31.621 --> 30:32.497
I'm scared.

30:33.998 --> 30:35.166
We are all scared.

30:36.209 --> 30:37.544
We must stay faithful.

30:38.795 --> 30:40.296
He's five months today.

30:41.631 --> 30:42.590
And I feel so…

30:46.928 --> 30:48.471
This is all I ever wanted,

30:49.556 --> 30:50.723
being a mother,

30:52.141 --> 30:53.184
having a family.

30:54.310 --> 30:56.729
Trust in God
to give you the gifts you ask for.

30:56.813 --> 30:58.022
You are right, I know,

30:58.106 --> 31:00.942
but I can't help asking
what keeps Francois for so long.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.447
Wherever he is,

31:07.073 --> 31:09.576
he is thinking about you and that baby boy

31:10.785 --> 31:14.080
and doing <i>everything </i>he can
to come back here.

31:16.749 --> 31:17.876
Five nights.

31:22.797 --> 31:24.465
Five nights.

31:42.275 --> 31:43.526
A moment ago,

31:44.861 --> 31:46.154
his first movement.

31:46.738 --> 31:48.114
Truly!

31:48.197 --> 31:49.073
Oh.

31:57.373 --> 31:59.500
God has given you a strong boy.

32:02.045 --> 32:05.924
-But now you need to sleep.

32:06.591 --> 32:07.592
Time to trade.

32:22.899 --> 32:23.816
Thank you.

32:24.859 --> 32:26.319
Close your eyes.

32:45.380 --> 32:47.173
Do you like that book, Peyton?

32:47.840 --> 32:48.675
Oh.

32:48.758 --> 32:49.968
Oh, this? Uh, yeah.

32:50.677 --> 32:52.178
I'd say it's a classic.

32:52.762 --> 32:55.390
Would you mind reading it to us?

32:55.473 --> 32:58.351
I'm… I'm not very good
at reading out loud. Um…

32:59.435 --> 33:00.937
But… But you can read it.

33:04.315 --> 33:07.068
I haven't tried reading English
in a very long time,

33:07.151 --> 33:09.028
almost ten years.

33:09.529 --> 33:11.781
I could not read it well.

33:11.864 --> 33:14.117
Really? You… You speak it perfectly.

33:14.200 --> 33:15.368
French is the same.

33:15.451 --> 33:18.830
Most all Rwandans speak it,
but we are not really taught the letters.

33:18.913 --> 33:19.747
Yeah.

33:21.124 --> 33:22.041
I do.

33:23.626 --> 33:25.003
Because you're Tutsi?

33:25.545 --> 33:27.005
Jeanette is Tutsi.

33:27.088 --> 33:29.799
It has nothing to do with that,
not for me.

33:29.882 --> 33:32.969
My family and I
have been goat farmers my whole life.

33:33.469 --> 33:35.430
No more privileged than any Hutu.

33:36.347 --> 33:38.141
I wanted to know the language.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.143
I taught myself.

33:49.986 --> 33:51.070
Thank you, Peyton.

33:51.988 --> 33:52.864
Yeah.

33:55.533 --> 33:58.578
<i>"Seeds of Love, Trees of Peace</i>

33:59.328 --> 34:01.122
by Susan Elijah Kern."

34:03.166 --> 34:06.335
"The seeds of love
are planted round the world."

34:06.919 --> 34:09.380
"They're twirled and whirled."

34:09.464 --> 34:11.591
"They're furled and hurled."

34:13.801 --> 34:15.178
"They're planted here

34:16.054 --> 34:17.180
and planted there."

34:18.139 --> 34:19.098
"Up high,

34:19.807 --> 34:20.641
down low,

34:21.225 --> 34:22.185
and everywhere."

34:23.936 --> 34:26.731
"Seeds of love
are planted each and every day."

34:27.315 --> 34:30.109
"They're part of life
in every single way."

34:30.610 --> 34:33.362
"Seeds of flowers, seeds of goats."

34:33.905 --> 34:35.031
"Those of people,

34:35.698 --> 34:36.824
those called oats."

35:04.143 --> 35:05.895
-<i>Ma puce.</i>

35:10.441 --> 35:12.693
I was afraid. I was afraid you were…

35:15.321 --> 35:16.531
You were so long.

35:16.614 --> 35:18.199
I am sorry,<i> ma puce.</i>

35:19.283 --> 35:22.286
You must know
that I will never, never leave you.

35:24.247 --> 35:26.541
No, no, no. Stay… stay there. Stay hidden.

35:28.709 --> 35:29.627
How is he?

35:30.878 --> 35:32.505
-He kicks hard.

35:32.588 --> 35:33.673
He is strong.

35:33.756 --> 35:36.300
Like his father, eh?

35:37.802 --> 35:38.678
Mmm.

35:41.973 --> 35:42.890
What kept you?

35:46.853 --> 35:49.772
It has been a bit of chaos.

35:50.898 --> 35:54.735
But I remembered you had Peyton's food
and some water already.

35:55.653 --> 35:59.657
I tried to come back to bring some more,
but it has not been possible.

36:00.449 --> 36:02.285
Come. We… We must go.

36:02.368 --> 36:03.744
The UN is here to take you.

36:03.828 --> 36:06.539
Not all of you.

36:07.331 --> 36:09.167
Only her. Peyton.

36:10.084 --> 36:11.669
They ask for whites only.

36:12.795 --> 36:15.923
I… I am sorry,<i> ma puce,</i>
but our time will come soon.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.717
Come. We must go.

36:18.467 --> 36:19.677
Only whites? Why?

36:19.760 --> 36:21.888
The UN
will come for the rest of us.

36:21.971 --> 36:24.599
-I just… I don't understand--
-Now. We must go now.

36:24.682 --> 36:26.434
There's no time for this.

36:26.934 --> 36:28.102
We have to leave now.

36:28.769 --> 36:29.687
-No!

36:30.980 --> 36:32.732
-Peyton.

36:34.984 --> 36:37.111
It shouldn't… It shouldn't be me.

36:39.113 --> 36:40.781
Come now. Come now, please.

36:40.865 --> 36:42.116
It shouldn't be me.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.577
-The militia is here.
-I can't.

36:44.660 --> 36:46.704
This is your last chance.

36:49.874 --> 36:51.042
It is too late.

36:51.125 --> 36:53.336
-I love you,<i> ma puce.</i>
-I love you too.

36:53.836 --> 36:55.087
I'll bring more food.

37:18.152 --> 37:19.737
Children belong home safe.

37:20.780 --> 37:21.948
Why didn't you go?

37:23.574 --> 37:25.284
I'm not a child.

37:25.368 --> 37:28.537
You are a child enough.
Someone should be protecting you.

37:29.038 --> 37:31.749
-What if I can't keep you safe?
-The UN's here.

37:32.375 --> 37:35.795
-They'll come back for us tomorrow.
-One more day your mother worries.

37:35.878 --> 37:38.297
My parents haven't worried
about me in years.

37:38.381 --> 37:42.385
She should have left.
She cuts our food rations by a fourth.

37:42.468 --> 37:44.887
We would have starved already without her.

37:44.971 --> 37:50.142
Peyton, the love of a mother and a father
is like nothing on this Earth.

37:53.729 --> 37:58.734
I like to imagine that
that's real for every child, but, uh…

38:01.320 --> 38:05.157
Some kids, they mess up bad enough,
and there's no more chances after that.

38:06.325 --> 38:08.494
It's like love can't find them anymore.

38:10.079 --> 38:11.163
Mmm.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.750
-Your mother's love--
-I killed my little brother.

38:19.046 --> 38:20.214
Four years ago.

38:24.885 --> 38:26.804
My parents, they were at a work party,

38:26.887 --> 38:29.974
and… Caleb…

38:33.060 --> 38:35.187
he wanted to watch<i> Ghostbusters.</i>

38:35.688 --> 38:38.607
So I told him that I would drive him
to the video store

38:38.691 --> 38:40.318
if he cleaned up my mess.

38:41.485 --> 38:44.030
Put my beer bottles
in the neighbor's trash.

38:46.574 --> 38:47.575
And he did it.

38:50.036 --> 38:55.082
He did it because he didn't want me
to get sent away again.

39:00.338 --> 39:02.131
I shouldn't have been driving.

39:03.132 --> 39:05.468
I had no idea how drunk I was.

39:05.968 --> 39:07.553
And, uh…

39:08.763 --> 39:12.558
…everyone agrees that it…
it shouldn't have been Caleb.

39:15.936 --> 39:17.188
And I've tried

39:18.272 --> 39:20.191
a few times since to, um,

39:21.942 --> 39:25.237
unburden them of myself, but…

39:28.157 --> 39:30.534
…I'm still here.

39:35.790 --> 39:36.874
I knew it.

39:38.334 --> 39:40.127
That is why you are in Rwanda.

39:41.253 --> 39:42.838
Your own atonement.

39:44.632 --> 39:46.050
That scar there,

39:46.550 --> 39:48.677
is that you trying to unburden them?

39:51.514 --> 39:52.890
Why didn't it work?

39:52.973 --> 39:54.475
That is enough, Mutesi.

39:54.558 --> 39:58.270
She was their burden,
and now she is our burden, so tell us--

39:58.354 --> 39:59.230
Enough.

39:59.730 --> 40:01.857
You think because you are so smart,

40:02.441 --> 40:05.277
because you see through people,
it gives you the right to be so cruel?

40:07.154 --> 40:09.156
I would ask you…

40:09.698 --> 40:12.785
…why you pick us all apart,
but it's already so obvious.

40:14.328 --> 40:16.580
You were violated in the worst ways,

40:16.664 --> 40:19.667
but that does not give you the right
to violate everyone else.

40:19.750 --> 40:22.169
So please leave us alone.

40:22.670 --> 40:25.381
I would if you didn't lock us in here.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.762
It wasn't deep enough.

40:31.846 --> 40:35.724
You don't actually have to cut that deep
to get to the radial artery, but, uh,

40:36.475 --> 40:38.144
I was just too scared.

40:44.191 --> 40:45.651
Ah. Finally,

40:46.444 --> 40:48.112
she passes judgment.

40:51.115 --> 40:53.909
No amount of volunteer work
will save your soul.

40:55.035 --> 40:58.581
Taking one's own life is the greatest sin.

40:59.623 --> 41:02.209
Only repentance before God might save you.

41:09.216 --> 41:13.721
You told me once that you became a nun
because your father was a priest.

41:15.598 --> 41:17.308
He was a rapist.

41:22.605 --> 41:23.606
Satisfied?

41:24.648 --> 41:26.066
Or shall we suffer more?

41:27.026 --> 41:29.236
You don't know suffering.

41:29.820 --> 41:33.073
Imagine being forgotten
because of what you've suffered.

41:33.908 --> 41:35.951
Because no one knows what to say.

41:36.952 --> 41:39.663
They look through you
as if you're not there.

41:39.747 --> 41:41.916
-Yes, I walk--

41:50.549 --> 41:51.467
Hmm.

41:59.433 --> 42:03.270
Four babies have lived and died inside me.

42:05.105 --> 42:07.942
Does that give me the right
to be cruel like you?

42:12.446 --> 42:15.658
When Francois returns,
you have my blessings to leave.

42:17.034 --> 42:18.160
I will not stop you.

42:30.422 --> 42:32.091
Fuck you, idiots!

42:33.926 --> 42:36.512
Allow me to piss in peace.

42:40.266 --> 42:41.350
Too much beers.

42:44.186 --> 42:47.648
Too much of the fucking beers.

42:51.068 --> 42:54.446
-<i>Bouffons, </i>who is next on our list?

42:54.530 --> 42:55.489
Hurry up.

42:56.574 --> 42:58.576
-Let's go.
-I'll meet you there.

43:16.218 --> 43:17.428
I can read it again.

43:23.559 --> 43:25.477
Right, repent before God.

43:26.979 --> 43:28.314
I've tried it already.

43:29.023 --> 43:29.982
Doesn't work.

43:36.447 --> 43:38.574
I was thinking I may give it a try.

43:38.657 --> 43:40.868
I said before,
I haven't tried in many years.

43:41.910 --> 43:44.079
It's never too late to learn

43:44.705 --> 43:45.831
and teach your son.

43:46.624 --> 43:49.918
We have nothing else to do
but have men piss on us.

43:53.547 --> 43:54.923
<i> "Seeds…</i>

43:56.842 --> 43:57.718
<i>…of…</i>

44:00.137 --> 44:00.971

44:12.775 --> 44:14.652

-Susan.

44:18.155 --> 44:19.114
"Susan

44:19.615 --> 44:21.784
Eli…"

44:25.037 --> 44:25.871
Elijah.

44:30.292 --> 44:31.168
"Elijah…

44:34.296 --> 44:36.465
-Kern"?
-Yeah.

44:37.049 --> 44:38.926
Good. That's right, "Kern."

44:45.849 --> 44:46.725
"The…

44:49.311 --> 44:50.479
seeds

44:51.397 --> 44:52.481
of…"

44:53.065 --> 44:55.275
I'm sorry
I was so long to return.

44:55.776 --> 44:58.112
There's been no safe time
with the damned rain.

44:58.904 --> 45:00.864
The Hutu army has been patrolling.

45:01.490 --> 45:02.658
Here, drink this.

45:04.868 --> 45:07.121
Good, good.

45:09.957 --> 45:11.291
What about the UN?

45:12.251 --> 45:13.210
How much longer?

45:15.295 --> 45:16.296
They, uh…

45:17.840 --> 45:18.966
The UN is gone.

45:20.551 --> 45:21.427
They left.

45:21.969 --> 45:22.803
What?

45:23.929 --> 45:25.389
When will they be back?

45:27.599 --> 45:30.227
You wanted to leave here?
Now is your chance.

45:34.273 --> 45:35.858
Francois Irakoze?

45:36.442 --> 45:37.818
We have your name.

45:39.653 --> 45:41.697
Here's the rest. Here, take it.

45:42.239 --> 45:44.158
Do not speak. Do not move.

45:44.992 --> 45:45.909
I must go.

45:46.410 --> 45:48.662
-Stay with us.
-No, they will find us all.

45:48.746 --> 45:50.289
Stop this right now. Release me.

45:51.540 --> 45:52.958
Francois Irakoze?

45:53.041 --> 45:55.753
Yes, yes.
Uh, give me a moment, please.

45:55.836 --> 45:56.837
Hey…

46:07.431 --> 46:08.891
Oh, hello, Commander.

46:08.974 --> 46:11.477
We have your name,
Francois. You see?

46:11.560 --> 46:14.062
-Yes. This…

46:14.146 --> 46:15.856
This… This must be a mistake, sir.

46:15.939 --> 46:18.066
Would you call
your neighbors liars?

46:18.567 --> 46:19.568
My neighbors?

46:19.651 --> 46:21.862
They are faithful to our cause.

46:21.945 --> 46:23.655
They have informed us you are not.

46:24.531 --> 46:27.034
Is anyone else
here in your home with you?

46:27.117 --> 46:29.495
You two stay here, watch for cockroaches.

46:30.120 --> 46:32.247
It's just me. No cockroaches.

46:32.331 --> 46:34.333
This is your wife in this picture?

46:34.416 --> 46:37.711
Yes. She's Hutu.
On a trip with her mother in Gitarama.

46:39.296 --> 46:40.839
And what is this?

46:40.923 --> 46:42.424
You won some recognition?

46:42.925 --> 46:44.593
No, sir. Yes, sir.

46:44.676 --> 46:46.512
Well, I am a teacher.

46:46.595 --> 46:49.640
This plaque recognizes
the accreditation for my school.

46:49.723 --> 46:50.682
New Hope.

46:50.766 --> 46:52.142
How nice.

46:53.310 --> 46:54.436
I haven't heard of it.

46:54.937 --> 46:55.896
It is new.

46:56.980 --> 46:58.357
A school for science.

46:59.441 --> 47:01.068
Do you educate Tutsi children?

47:01.151 --> 47:02.903
-No, no.

47:03.987 --> 47:06.907
Oh, no.
I educate Hutu children.

47:07.908 --> 47:08.951
Only Hutu.

47:12.162 --> 47:13.747
Dare you lie to me?

47:19.044 --> 47:20.462
No, sir.

47:21.421 --> 47:22.506
Oh…

47:23.465 --> 47:24.800
How wonderful for you.

47:25.509 --> 47:26.927
Is this your first?

47:27.010 --> 47:28.178
And a boy?

47:28.720 --> 47:32.558
-A strong Hutu man, eh?
-Ye… yes, sir.

47:32.641 --> 47:35.102
Brought up
in a world without Tutsis.

47:35.853 --> 47:36.687
Very good.

47:36.770 --> 47:38.522
Come, brothers!

47:38.605 --> 47:41.358
Let's leave him
to paint the boy's nursery.

47:41.441 --> 47:43.569
You can join up with us when you're done.

47:44.403 --> 47:47.656
Nothing more gratifying
than killing cockroaches.

47:47.739 --> 47:49.992
We will be back
to visit again, Francois.

47:50.075 --> 47:51.994
I look forward to meeting your wife.

48:06.049 --> 48:08.969
Wait, we must set rations!
No, stop! We are all starving!

48:09.970 --> 48:11.972
-Annick is pregnant!

48:13.140 --> 48:14.892
-You wasted it!

48:17.477 --> 48:19.813
What is wrong with you?
You are like those dogs.

48:19.897 --> 48:22.316
I will kill you for that rice.

48:34.202 --> 48:35.037
This is hell!

48:37.039 --> 48:38.707
You are so ungrateful!

48:38.790 --> 48:41.335
It sickens me to look at you!
It sickens me!

48:44.004 --> 48:46.715
-Jeanette.

48:46.798 --> 48:48.967
Jeanette. Jeanette, that's enough!

49:06.234 --> 49:08.028
We are going to die in here.

49:10.280 --> 49:14.159
Over two weeks and nothing from Belgium.

49:15.285 --> 49:17.496
Who is going to end this?

49:19.748 --> 49:23.585
You stupid woman.

49:24.628 --> 49:25.587
A Hutu…

49:28.256 --> 49:29.716
free to leave this hell.

49:34.137 --> 49:35.430
Why are you here?

49:39.184 --> 49:40.560
I'm not freer than you.

50:14.094 --> 50:16.013
I was so hungry.

50:26.690 --> 50:28.775
My father said she died in sin.

50:33.864 --> 50:35.032
The greatest sin.

50:36.950 --> 50:37.951
My mother…

50:39.327 --> 50:41.246
I am afraid to ask God

50:42.622 --> 50:44.416
where does her soul rest?

50:46.501 --> 50:49.046
Have I been faultless enough
to absolve her?

50:52.924 --> 50:54.760
I was so hungry.

50:57.220 --> 50:58.847
I'm so sorry.

51:39.471 --> 51:40.722
"Round

51:41.807 --> 51:43.225
the world."

51:43.308 --> 51:44.810
"Round the world."

51:44.893 --> 51:46.394
"They are…"

51:47.270 --> 51:50.565
-What is that little thing up there?

51:50.649 --> 51:51.775
What thing?

51:52.526 --> 51:53.777
Uh, that's an apostrophe.

51:54.277 --> 51:56.488
They put it there
when a letter is missing.

51:56.988 --> 51:58.490
When the letter is missing?

51:59.950 --> 52:01.868
Why don't they just put in the letter?

52:03.120 --> 52:05.997
Mmm, because, well,
it makes you pronounce it differently.

52:06.081 --> 52:08.250
It's like a… a shortcut.

52:08.333 --> 52:09.709
It's called a contraction.

52:09.793 --> 52:11.711
-Contraction.

52:12.671 --> 52:13.588
Mmm.

52:14.422 --> 52:15.674
I don't get it.

52:16.925 --> 52:17.968
I don't know.

52:21.388 --> 52:23.390
Why do you want
to speak so fast?

52:25.100 --> 52:27.144
-Why don't you speak slower?

52:28.019 --> 52:30.438
You see? You just said "don't."

52:30.939 --> 52:33.942
That's… That's a contraction.
It comes from "do not."

52:34.734 --> 52:36.236
Um, see, here.

52:40.157 --> 52:40.991
The wall.

53:04.764 --> 53:06.057
Peo…

53:09.811 --> 53:10.645
ple.

53:15.692 --> 53:16.735
Three this time.

53:19.613 --> 53:21.531
"Those

53:22.032 --> 53:24.326
called

53:25.035 --> 53:26.828
oats."

53:29.873 --> 53:31.041
You know it. It's--

53:31.124 --> 53:32.834
No, no, no. Don't tell me.

53:34.878 --> 53:36.504
T-H-O-S-E.

53:37.714 --> 53:39.716
Here. Write it then.

53:47.015 --> 53:47.974
I don't want to.

53:49.392 --> 53:50.685
It's obvious you do.

53:50.769 --> 53:53.104
Any time you want to play, let us know.

54:12.290 --> 54:13.291
How am I doing?

54:14.876 --> 54:15.835
You're doing great.

54:19.965 --> 54:21.591
This one is half full.

54:56.001 --> 54:57.252
What are you writing?

54:59.796 --> 55:01.047
Letters for my son.

55:04.050 --> 55:05.552
You'll read them to him someday.

55:09.222 --> 55:10.307
What do they say?

55:12.309 --> 55:14.519
I'm only on my second one so far.

55:16.980 --> 55:18.064
"My sweet boy."

55:19.232 --> 55:20.108
"Today,

55:21.067 --> 55:23.278
we marked the wall for day 34."

55:26.781 --> 55:29.242
"It feels like a lifetime in this room."

55:30.243 --> 55:32.245
"I forget the smell of flowers."

55:33.830 --> 55:36.666
"Can't remember the feel
of a bath on my skin."

55:38.043 --> 55:41.087
"But I learn things I have never known."

55:44.466 --> 55:45.800
"An American girl

55:46.885 --> 55:50.138
I have thought must have a perfect life,

55:52.432 --> 55:54.351
but she has sought death."

55:58.146 --> 55:59.564
"A sister of the faith,

56:01.024 --> 56:02.108
one with God,

56:02.192 --> 56:06.237
carrying a burden
she hasn't relinquished into God's hands."

56:10.033 --> 56:11.201
"A Tutsi girl…

56:13.828 --> 56:15.121
so beautiful…

56:17.123 --> 56:18.291
so bright…

56:20.293 --> 56:23.755
but a victim who claims her anger
like her name."

56:26.299 --> 56:27.175
"And myself."

56:29.511 --> 56:30.720
"I know my pain."

56:32.097 --> 56:33.014
"Baby boy…

56:35.558 --> 56:37.477
you will be my great happiness."

56:42.190 --> 56:44.359
"I write these things for you…

56:46.361 --> 56:49.989
so you will know the truths
we cannot always see in the open."

56:57.288 --> 56:58.498
That is all so far.

57:09.259 --> 57:11.678
I don't want to die with this anger.

57:16.433 --> 57:17.559
May I add my name?

57:25.442 --> 57:28.820
My family and I, our farm is quite small,

57:30.029 --> 57:32.699
but I've always wanted
to make things change.

57:35.076 --> 57:36.202
When I was…

57:39.456 --> 57:40.915
When my uncle would…

57:44.085 --> 57:47.797
The women in my village,
they would do nothing.

57:48.590 --> 57:52.010
These women, like mothers to me,

57:52.594 --> 57:53.928
the men like fathers,

57:55.638 --> 57:58.433
my own mother and father,

57:59.517 --> 58:00.727
they did nothing

58:01.686 --> 58:03.646
because of fear and shame.

58:08.776 --> 58:11.279
It burned me up like fire.

58:28.463 --> 58:31.716
I was with my mother
when the killing started.

58:33.468 --> 58:36.137
There was a moment
I could have protected her,

58:37.055 --> 58:38.223
but I ran.

58:43.937 --> 58:45.438
I see your suffering,

58:46.564 --> 58:47.440
all of you.

58:49.150 --> 58:53.071
It is so familiar.

58:56.699 --> 59:01.162
If I do nothing for you now,
then I am no different

59:01.663 --> 59:04.082
than those women who did nothing for me.

59:11.297 --> 59:14.634
We… are one.

59:33.361 --> 59:34.821
You are a good teacher.

59:42.203 --> 59:43.746
You should write his name.

59:44.247 --> 59:46.708
I don't know it.

59:49.335 --> 59:50.837
Maybe we should name him…

59:52.880 --> 59:53.715
Elijah?

59:57.927 --> 59:58.886
Elijah.

1:00:14.902 --> 1:00:19.157
"Seeds of people
come from moms and dads together

1:00:20.992 --> 1:00:23.828
to make a baby boy or girl

1:00:24.537 --> 1:00:26.914
in any kind of weather."

1:00:27.957 --> 1:00:31.669
"Making babies makes us glad

1:00:31.753 --> 1:00:35.381
and gives us future moms and dads."

1:00:42.055 --> 1:00:43.181
Seeds of…

1:00:45.767 --> 1:00:48.144
of goats.

1:00:48.227 --> 1:00:49.437
Goats.

1:00:49.979 --> 1:00:54.233
Seeds of goats and all the animals

1:00:55.735 --> 1:00:59.906
are planted just the same.

1:01:02.659 --> 1:01:03.951
-What?

1:01:04.661 --> 1:01:05.703
The light.

1:01:07.789 --> 1:01:09.666
-Can you fix it?
-I'm trying.

1:01:10.500 --> 1:01:12.460
-No, give it to me.
-Jeanette.

1:01:13.002 --> 1:01:15.797
-You're going to break it.

1:01:15.880 --> 1:01:18.466
-Let me try!
-Jeanette, stop!

1:01:18.549 --> 1:01:21.135
The Lord will let us
have our light back!

1:01:21.219 --> 1:01:23.388
-Jeanette, stop!

1:01:23.471 --> 1:01:26.140
-You're going to break it.
-Show mercy to my family.

1:01:26.224 --> 1:01:28.768
-Jeanette.

1:01:43.533 --> 1:01:45.034
-Why?

1:01:46.869 --> 1:01:48.496
Why hasn't he come back?

1:01:51.457 --> 1:01:52.959
It has been ten days.

1:01:54.627 --> 1:01:56.379
We'll be out of food.

1:02:04.721 --> 1:02:06.347
He's in a safe place.

1:02:09.350 --> 1:02:11.436
They will not be found at New Hope.

1:02:11.978 --> 1:02:13.938
He cannot stay at New Hope.

1:02:15.064 --> 1:02:18.776
They are killing every Tutsi
and every Hutu moderate.

1:02:19.819 --> 1:02:21.195
They will look for him.

1:02:22.280 --> 1:02:23.948
He must hide somewhere else.

1:03:02.737 --> 1:03:03.613
<i>Ma puce.</i>

1:03:05.907 --> 1:03:06.783
<i>Ma puce.</i>

1:03:09.535 --> 1:03:10.828
It's okay. It is me.

1:03:11.329 --> 1:03:13.581
-Don't be afraid.

1:03:13.664 --> 1:03:15.041
Don't be afraid.

1:03:33.851 --> 1:03:36.604
-Are they finally here?
-<i> Ma puce.</i>

1:03:37.939 --> 1:03:39.732
I am so sorry I failed you.

1:03:41.692 --> 1:03:43.528
You have not failed anyone.

1:03:45.196 --> 1:03:47.198
You are the greatest teacher in Kigali.

1:03:47.782 --> 1:03:49.450
We will get new books.

1:03:50.910 --> 1:03:51.869
We must.

1:03:52.578 --> 1:03:53.412
What?

1:03:55.623 --> 1:03:59.168
<i>Ma puce, </i>that was a long time ago.

1:04:00.962 --> 1:04:04.382
We got new books years ago.

1:04:09.011 --> 1:04:12.056
Have you been eating? You don't look well.

1:04:13.099 --> 1:04:14.433
How is our son?

1:04:15.017 --> 1:04:17.436
He kicks.
He's… He's resting more.

1:04:18.229 --> 1:04:19.105
Here.

1:04:25.862 --> 1:04:27.113
Eat, eat, eat.

1:04:33.369 --> 1:04:34.203
Here.

1:04:35.454 --> 1:04:37.957
-Take it.
-No. It is for you and him.

1:04:38.040 --> 1:04:40.126
-There isn't enough.
-It is for you.

1:04:40.918 --> 1:04:41.794
Please.

1:04:44.547 --> 1:04:47.008
Thank you, <i>ma puce. </i>Thank you.

1:04:50.636 --> 1:04:52.597
Everyone we've ever known…

1:04:54.056 --> 1:04:57.143
The killings
have only gotten worse each day.

1:04:58.102 --> 1:05:01.022
They say hundreds of thousands,<i> ma puce.</i>

1:05:01.856 --> 1:05:03.983
And no one has come to make it stop.

1:05:04.942 --> 1:05:05.818
<i>Ma puce,</i>

1:05:07.320 --> 1:05:08.571
no one is coming.

1:05:14.619 --> 1:05:19.165
They say Hôtel des Mille Collines
is the only safe place of refuge,

1:05:19.248 --> 1:05:22.501
but the roadblocks…
There's no way to get there.

1:05:23.127 --> 1:05:26.505
<i>Ma puce, </i>I do not know
when I will be back.

1:05:28.716 --> 1:05:31.677
If they find us, I don't know what to…

1:05:31.761 --> 1:05:32.595
No.

1:05:34.221 --> 1:05:35.473
You will stay hidden.

1:05:36.474 --> 1:05:38.059
-Mmm.
-Hmm?

1:05:38.142 --> 1:05:39.060
Mmm.

1:05:45.483 --> 1:05:48.110
-I love you,<i> ma puce.</i>
-No. Stay.

1:05:48.694 --> 1:05:51.572
-You can only be safe if you stay.
-I cannot.

1:05:52.156 --> 1:05:54.075
There are others who need help too.

1:05:54.867 --> 1:05:55.701
Others?

1:05:56.953 --> 1:05:57.870
What others?

1:05:59.664 --> 1:06:00.498
Our neighbors.

1:06:02.166 --> 1:06:04.377
Samira, baby Nafia.

1:06:04.460 --> 1:06:07.755
I found them hiding. No food, no water.

1:06:08.381 --> 1:06:09.548
I cannot stay.

1:06:09.632 --> 1:06:12.093
-Then I'll come with you.
-No, please.

1:06:12.176 --> 1:06:13.928
Please. Please, you will stay here.

1:06:14.011 --> 1:06:16.555
You cannot leave me to rot
while you help them.

1:06:17.640 --> 1:06:19.934
How can you do that to me? Hmm?

1:06:20.810 --> 1:06:23.020
You cannot help them while we starve!

1:06:23.729 --> 1:06:27.066
-Annick, they are dying.
-Our boy is dying!

1:06:29.151 --> 1:06:31.195
Come.

1:06:32.738 --> 1:06:33.948
I love you,<i> ma puce.</i>

1:06:34.031 --> 1:06:36.242
No. No, Francois, no.

1:06:36.325 --> 1:06:38.369
Annick. Annick. Annick.

1:06:38.452 --> 1:06:41.163
-Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me.

1:06:41.664 --> 1:06:43.374
You are mine always, eh?

1:06:44.250 --> 1:06:45.376
And I am yours.

1:06:46.293 --> 1:06:48.921
-They can never change that.

1:06:50.131 --> 1:06:51.716
I love you,<i> ma puce.</i>

1:09:49.393 --> 1:09:50.519
Only a dream.

1:09:58.777 --> 1:10:00.571
Oh my God. No, she's in labor.

1:10:06.410 --> 1:10:07.328
What should we do?

1:10:08.162 --> 1:10:12.625
I've done this many times with the goats.
Slow her heartbeat so she will bleed less.

1:10:13.250 --> 1:10:14.210
And water.

1:10:23.552 --> 1:10:26.722
Annick. Annick, you must stop this noise.

1:10:26.805 --> 1:10:28.265
You breathe with us now, yes?

1:10:35.689 --> 1:10:38.776
That is very good, Annick.
You're doing much better than the goats.

1:10:42.071 --> 1:10:43.572
Elijah is on his way.

1:10:43.656 --> 1:10:44.823
His head is coming.

1:10:45.407 --> 1:10:46.450
Push.

1:10:46.533 --> 1:10:47.493
Push harder.

1:10:49.662 --> 1:10:50.913
She has to be quiet!

1:10:56.043 --> 1:10:57.628
Push. Push harder.

1:10:57.711 --> 1:10:58.963
Push for your son.

1:10:59.046 --> 1:11:00.631
Push with all your might.

1:12:10.743 --> 1:12:12.703
<i>"Seventy-three days."</i>

1:12:14.413 --> 1:12:16.373
<i>"None of us menstruates anymore."</i>

1:12:18.250 --> 1:12:20.336
<i>"None of us goes to the bathroom."</i>

1:12:22.254 --> 1:12:25.341
<i>"I can feel my spirit</i>
<i>eager for the long sleep."</i>

1:12:26.342 --> 1:12:28.344
<i>"Life leaves my body."</i>

1:12:28.427 --> 1:12:30.346
<i>"My bones waste away."</i>

1:12:30.429 --> 1:12:32.973
<i>"We never thought</i>
<i>we'd be in here this long,</i>

1:12:33.057 --> 1:12:36.685
<i>but we delay the inevitable."</i>

1:12:38.312 --> 1:12:40.272
<i>"They have taken everything now."</i>

1:12:40.856 --> 1:12:44.234
<i>"Elijah, you have ceased to move."</i>

1:12:44.985 --> 1:12:47.071
<i>"Are you with God, my sweet angel?"</i>

1:12:49.073 --> 1:12:50.741
<i>"I fear it is so."</i>

1:12:52.201 --> 1:12:54.787
<i>"And, Francois, what keeps you?"</i>

1:12:57.748 --> 1:13:00.876
<i>"As I look out, see men,</i>

1:13:00.959 --> 1:13:03.128
<i>women, children,</i>

1:13:03.754 --> 1:13:06.215
<i>piled up in that mocking grave,</i>

1:13:08.717 --> 1:13:10.636
<i>I wish to be one of them."</i>

1:13:11.220 --> 1:13:15.015
<i>"Only so that I might rest beneath the sky</i>

1:13:15.849 --> 1:13:18.644
<i>with the cool rain to cleanse my skin."</i>

1:13:20.020 --> 1:13:24.441
<i>"Only so that the mud</i>
<i>would rise up and cradle me."</i>

1:13:25.275 --> 1:13:28.153
<i>"Only so that I could finally</i>

1:13:28.737 --> 1:13:32.491
<i>have… peace."</i>

1:13:35.494 --> 1:13:36.495
Annick.

1:13:36.578 --> 1:13:38.163
It is your turn to read.

1:13:39.581 --> 1:13:40.749
Come on, sit up.

1:13:41.250 --> 1:13:43.335
Your pronunciation is still bad.

1:13:53.095 --> 1:13:54.346
Peyton!

1:14:00.894 --> 1:14:01.728
Peyton!

1:14:04.314 --> 1:14:05.149
Peyton!

1:14:12.072 --> 1:14:12.948
Peyton!

1:14:22.207 --> 1:14:23.459
Peyton, please!

1:14:25.627 --> 1:14:28.380
Peyton, please.

1:14:28.964 --> 1:14:29.798
Wake.

1:14:31.300 --> 1:14:32.176
Wake.

1:14:44.521 --> 1:14:45.731
How is he?

1:15:22.017 --> 1:15:22.851
<i>Ma puce?</i>

1:15:25.729 --> 1:15:26.563
<i>Ma puce?</i>

1:15:27.814 --> 1:15:29.983
Oh God. Oh God.

1:15:31.109 --> 1:15:33.028
Please wake. Please wake. Please wake.

1:15:38.283 --> 1:15:39.910
<i>Ma puce? Ma puce?</i>

1:15:42.246 --> 1:15:44.414
It is okay. It is me. It is me.

1:15:45.499 --> 1:15:46.333
Good.

1:15:47.209 --> 1:15:48.794
Am I with angels?

1:15:49.670 --> 1:15:50.837
No,<i> ma puce.</i>

1:15:52.214 --> 1:15:53.298
You are alive.

1:15:55.133 --> 1:15:56.009
Eat this.

1:15:57.010 --> 1:15:57.844
Eat this.

1:15:58.595 --> 1:15:59.846
Regain your strength.

1:16:07.104 --> 1:16:08.063
Our son…

1:16:14.903 --> 1:16:17.406
I see angels when I close my eyes.

1:16:19.741 --> 1:16:21.660
They are going to take him soon.

1:16:23.954 --> 1:16:26.206
-And me.
-No, stay with me.

1:16:26.790 --> 1:16:29.001
We have a duty to fight.

1:16:29.876 --> 1:16:31.169
We are alive.

1:16:35.799 --> 1:16:38.719
<i>Ma puce, </i>listen carefully to me.

1:16:39.720 --> 1:16:41.013
Nafia is dead.

1:16:50.147 --> 1:16:51.982
Not even two years old.

1:16:54.401 --> 1:16:56.403
I held her when she was born.

1:17:06.079 --> 1:17:06.997
Samira?

1:17:11.752 --> 1:17:13.378
She is without hope.

1:17:15.005 --> 1:17:18.300
This is why we must fight. Huh?

1:17:18.383 --> 1:17:19.426
We must live.

1:17:35.525 --> 1:17:40.280
<i>Ma puce, </i>the rebel army is fighting back,
and they are winning.

1:17:40.364 --> 1:17:42.324
The Hutus have begun to flee.

1:17:43.784 --> 1:17:46.036
Their roadblocks are nearly abandoned.

1:17:47.287 --> 1:17:49.414
We can make it
to the Hôtel des Mille Collines

1:17:49.498 --> 1:17:51.208
if we go in the night. Huh?

1:17:56.880 --> 1:17:57.881
Make them eat.

1:17:59.800 --> 1:18:01.301
The rebels have come.

1:18:01.385 --> 1:18:03.428
The rebels have come.

1:18:03.512 --> 1:18:05.097
Here, eat this.

1:18:06.890 --> 1:18:08.475
-Rebels?
-Yes.

1:18:08.558 --> 1:18:10.227
-Is that good?
-Yes.

1:18:13.021 --> 1:18:13.855
Mutesi.

1:18:14.606 --> 1:18:15.649
Mutesi.

1:18:15.732 --> 1:18:16.566
Eat.

1:18:17.234 --> 1:18:18.151
Jeanette.

1:18:20.862 --> 1:18:21.738
Jeanette.

1:18:24.282 --> 1:18:25.158
Jeanette?

1:18:27.828 --> 1:18:28.662
Jeanette?

1:18:35.377 --> 1:18:37.212
Here, eat, drink,

1:18:38.839 --> 1:18:40.882
move around, get stronger.

1:18:40.966 --> 1:18:43.552
You only need to survive here
one day more.

1:18:44.386 --> 1:18:46.847
-Only one?
-Yes,<i> ma puce.</i>

1:18:47.347 --> 1:18:48.557
Only one day more.

1:19:08.577 --> 1:19:11.997
"This nectar turns into a treat

1:19:12.664 --> 1:19:16.710

"Seeds of all the animals

1:19:39.941 --> 1:19:42.444
-Out! All of you!

1:19:42.527 --> 1:19:44.112
Peter, let's go. Out.

1:19:47.741 --> 1:19:49.993
Go inside
and bring Francois out here.

1:19:51.203 --> 1:19:54.414
Seba… Sir, my students…

1:19:54.498 --> 1:19:56.124
Peter, do what is right.

1:19:56.208 --> 1:20:00.045
Do it, Peter!
Or your cockroach students will all die.

1:20:00.128 --> 1:20:01.755
It's children.

1:20:01.838 --> 1:20:04.424
Francois is not here.

1:20:04.508 --> 1:20:06.760
You know he is not here.

1:20:07.344 --> 1:20:08.845
So you know where he is!

1:20:08.929 --> 1:20:10.472
I do not know.

1:20:10.555 --> 1:20:11.973
-Liar!

1:20:12.057 --> 1:20:14.810
Peter,
earn your place among Hutus again.

1:20:14.893 --> 1:20:17.312
Either tell us where Francois is

1:20:17.896 --> 1:20:20.690
or take my machete
and chop these cockroaches for me.

1:20:21.483 --> 1:20:24.319
If you do not, I will kill them,

1:20:24.945 --> 1:20:26.279
you, and your wife.

1:20:28.532 --> 1:20:32.077
-Do it, or it is you.

1:20:34.663 --> 1:20:36.790
-I'm sorry!

1:20:36.873 --> 1:20:38.458
I'm sorry! Please forgive me!

1:20:55.058 --> 1:20:57.143
No more! No more!

1:20:58.103 --> 1:21:00.522
I cannot finish them, please!

1:21:01.481 --> 1:21:03.024
Tell us where Francois

1:21:03.108 --> 1:21:05.694
and the rest
of your cockroaches are hiding,

1:21:05.777 --> 1:21:08.321
and I will let those two babies live.

1:21:09.155 --> 1:21:10.866
You have my word.

1:21:10.949 --> 1:21:13.869
-It's okay, little girl. Don't cry.

1:21:16.413 --> 1:21:18.331
Okay, okay! Stop, stop!

1:21:18.415 --> 1:21:20.542
Please, don't hurt her!

1:21:21.126 --> 1:21:24.254
They are hiding in a small school.

1:21:24.337 --> 1:21:27.757
It is new. A few miles outside Kigali.

1:21:28.341 --> 1:21:29.467
New Hope.

1:21:29.551 --> 1:21:31.553
New Hope School of Science.

1:21:35.765 --> 1:21:37.017
Let's go!

1:21:58.914 --> 1:22:00.123
I don't wanna die.

1:22:10.091 --> 1:22:12.177
Francois, he is…

1:22:14.971 --> 1:22:16.556
He said only one day.

1:22:18.558 --> 1:22:19.476
Today.

1:22:21.478 --> 1:22:23.313
We have to get out of here.

1:22:25.023 --> 1:22:27.943
One, two, three.

1:22:31.780 --> 1:22:33.323
We must keep trying.

1:22:33.406 --> 1:22:35.367
It will open. Push again.

1:22:35.450 --> 1:22:36.660
It has been all day.

1:22:37.285 --> 1:22:38.912
The lock is too strong.

1:22:39.412 --> 1:22:40.497
And no key.

1:22:46.795 --> 1:22:48.588
Is it Francois?

1:22:52.759 --> 1:22:55.720
-Search everywhere.

1:22:55.804 --> 1:22:58.181
You've seen how they can fit
into the smallest hole.

1:23:02.560 --> 1:23:03.687
Annick Irakoze.

1:23:04.354 --> 1:23:06.982
You and your husband
are traitors to your people.

1:23:08.024 --> 1:23:09.150
Find the attic.

1:23:10.652 --> 1:23:13.822
Annick, if you surrender,
perhaps we will spare your life.

1:23:18.368 --> 1:23:19.619
Come out right now!

1:23:21.162 --> 1:23:22.622
I know you are up there.

1:23:26.334 --> 1:23:28.378
-Francois confessed.

1:23:30.880 --> 1:23:33.341
Seba, I think I heard one of them.

1:23:34.551 --> 1:23:35.844
I heard it too.

1:23:38.054 --> 1:23:40.098
Tell her how we tortured her husband.

1:23:41.808 --> 1:23:43.935
We found him hiding in that school.

1:23:45.395 --> 1:23:47.355
He shitted himself
like a frightened animal.

1:23:47.439 --> 1:23:50.567
We cut off his feet first
so he could not run.

1:23:51.067 --> 1:23:52.861
Still, he would not tell us a thing

1:23:53.653 --> 1:23:55.113
until his castration.

1:23:56.531 --> 1:23:59.284
He told us
everything we needed to know.

1:23:59.367 --> 1:24:03.371
By then, he was in a lot of pain,
so we tried to be merciful.

1:24:03.955 --> 1:24:07.083
Offered him a bullet
for only 7,000 francs.

1:24:07.667 --> 1:24:08.668
A discount.

1:24:09.377 --> 1:24:10.587
But he had no money.

1:24:11.796 --> 1:24:14.132
So I slit his throat open.

1:24:23.975 --> 1:24:26.019
Seba,
the commander is looking for you.

1:24:26.102 --> 1:24:27.437
Give me more time!

1:24:27.520 --> 1:24:28.521
He said now.

1:24:28.605 --> 1:24:30.648
All right! Let's go.

1:24:30.732 --> 1:24:34.110
But we will come back at sunup
to find these cockroaches.

1:24:48.249 --> 1:24:49.709
They will come soon.

1:24:50.960 --> 1:24:53.171
The storm is loud enough to cover us.

1:24:54.214 --> 1:24:55.340
Who will take us?

1:24:56.174 --> 1:24:58.384
-They killed Francois.
-Quiet.

1:25:01.888 --> 1:25:03.598
If we can get out of here,

1:25:04.516 --> 1:25:06.184
we can get to the Mille Collines.

1:25:07.435 --> 1:25:08.394
I know the way.

1:25:10.396 --> 1:25:12.273
So many bodies in the street.

1:25:15.527 --> 1:25:17.403
We are leaving soon.

1:25:19.030 --> 1:25:20.573
-Come.
-No.

1:25:22.784 --> 1:25:23.701
Leave me here.

1:25:25.745 --> 1:25:28.665
If you stay, we will all stay.

1:25:29.999 --> 1:25:34.337
And I would rather die
than let any man hurt me again.

1:25:35.839 --> 1:25:36.798
Now sit up.

1:25:37.298 --> 1:25:38.675
Be strong.

1:25:39.551 --> 1:25:41.469
Elijah may still live.

1:25:42.053 --> 1:25:45.682
If he is to be a strong boy,
he must have a strong mother.

1:25:46.724 --> 1:25:47.600
And we,

1:25:48.852 --> 1:25:52.230
we are the sisters you never wanted.

1:25:55.483 --> 1:25:56.568
They'll take you too.

1:25:58.903 --> 1:25:59.904
They'll find us.

1:26:01.865 --> 1:26:03.324
And when they do…

1:26:03.408 --> 1:26:04.951
That is why we must leave.

1:26:15.336 --> 1:26:16.337
Help me!

1:26:18.256 --> 1:26:19.799
Ready?

1:26:21.509 --> 1:26:23.678
-Go.

1:26:25.180 --> 1:26:26.055
Help us!

1:26:27.557 --> 1:26:28.641
Annick!

1:27:18.775 --> 1:27:19.734
A key.

1:27:35.792 --> 1:27:36.918
He kicks.

1:27:38.378 --> 1:27:39.337
He kicks.

1:29:41.459 --> 1:29:44.295
He said they are inside,
in the kitchen. Quickly.

1:29:58.351 --> 1:30:01.396
-They're still alive.

1:30:05.233 --> 1:30:07.485
<i>-Ma puce, </i>I'm here.

1:30:10.113 --> 1:30:11.030
I'm here.

1:30:13.199 --> 1:30:14.492
We are safe now.

1:30:14.575 --> 1:30:17.286
We are safe. These men are RPF.

1:30:21.999 --> 1:30:23.960
They found the school, yes, yes.

1:30:25.837 --> 1:30:26.963
It was a massacre.

1:30:28.381 --> 1:30:29.757
But I was not there.

1:30:30.633 --> 1:30:34.345
I left only for a few hours to bury Nafia.
But when I returned…

1:30:36.347 --> 1:30:37.640
everyone was dead.

1:30:40.476 --> 1:30:42.478
That baby girl protected me.

1:30:43.062 --> 1:30:44.313
Elijah too.

1:30:49.193 --> 1:30:54.323
<i>We survived 81 days in that room.</i>

1:30:57.410 --> 1:30:58.411
Let's go.

1:30:59.328 --> 1:31:00.204
Let's go.

1:31:02.165 --> 1:31:04.125
<i>It seemed we lost everything.</i>

1:31:05.126 --> 1:31:09.505
<i>But we found the most important thing</i>
<i>we never knew to look for,</i>

1:31:11.048 --> 1:31:11.924
<i>each other.</i>

1:31:13.426 --> 1:31:15.011
<i>They say I saved them,</i>

1:31:15.094 --> 1:31:18.097
<i>but really, they saved me.</i>

1:31:18.848 --> 1:31:20.099
<i>They saved Elijah.</i>

1:31:22.268 --> 1:31:23.436
<i>My sisters.</i>

1:31:25.146 --> 1:31:26.272
<i>And now, together,</i>

1:31:27.690 --> 1:31:29.317
<i>we will find healing.</i>

1:31:30.735 --> 1:31:32.028
<i>We will claim</i>

1:31:32.945 --> 1:31:33.863
<i>peace.</i>
