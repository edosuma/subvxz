WEBVTT

00:06.840 --> 00:10.444
UH-OH, CHARLIE,
LOOK AT YOUR TUMMY.

00:10.478 --> 00:13.147
I THINK SOMEBODY'S
HAD ENOUGH PANCAKES.
NO NO.

00:13.181 --> 00:15.149
OH MY GOODNESS,

00:15.183 --> 00:17.151
SOMEBODY LOVES
HER BLANKIE.

00:17.185 --> 00:19.187
WHOO!

00:19.220 --> 00:22.090
ALL RIGHT, DAD,
NOW PULL OUT YOUR BLANKIE.

00:24.092 --> 00:26.060
SURE THING, SON,

00:26.094 --> 00:29.530
RIGHT AFTER I DROP YOU OFF
AT A MILITARY SCHOOL.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.465
OH, HEY, LOOK WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN ON SATURDAY.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.467
OH, YEAH, THE TRUCK
FROM THE THRIFT STORE
IS COMING.

00:33.501 --> 00:36.070
AND IT'S YOUR
WEDDING ANNIVERSARY.

00:36.104 --> 00:37.605
RIGHT.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.340
WHAT TIME IS
THE TRUCK COMING?

00:39.373 --> 00:42.210
SO HOW ARE YOU GUYS
GONNA CELEBRATE THIS YEAR?

00:42.243 --> 00:44.612
THERE'S NO BETTER
WAY TO CELEBRATE
THAN THE TAX DEDUCTION

00:44.645 --> 00:46.547
WE'RE GONNA GET FROM
DONATING OLD CLOTHES.

00:46.580 --> 00:51.085
BOB, REMEMBER THE DEDUCTION
FROM OUR 10th ANNIVERSARY?

00:51.119 --> 00:53.187
Both:
OOH!

00:58.259 --> 01:00.194
GUYS, GUYS, GUYS,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:00.228 --> 01:02.230
I THINK WE SHOULD DO
SOMETHING FOR MOM AND DAD
ON THEIR ANNIVERSARY.

01:02.263 --> 01:05.133
DON'T WE DO ENOUGH FOR THEM
ON MOTHER'S AND FATHER'S DAY?

01:05.166 --> 01:07.635
YOU NEVER DO
ANYTHING FOR THEM.

01:07.668 --> 01:10.104
EXCUSE ME,
I WAS BORN,

01:10.138 --> 01:12.106
WHICH MADE THEM
A MOTHER AND A FATHER.

01:12.140 --> 01:14.208
MY WORK IS DONE.

01:14.242 --> 01:16.244
WELL, I THINK

01:16.277 --> 01:19.213
WE SHOULD SURPRISE THEM
WITH A ROMANTIC DINNER.

01:19.247 --> 01:21.382
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE
A DINNER?

01:21.415 --> 01:23.384
I THINK WE SHOULD
SURPRISE THEM

01:23.417 --> 01:25.219
AND ORDER
A ROMANTIC DINNER.

01:25.253 --> 01:27.121
THEN WE CAN SERVE IT
TO THEM LIKE WAITERS.

01:27.155 --> 01:30.391
WHY DO GIRL IDEAS ALWAYS
TAKE SO MUCH WORK?

01:30.424 --> 01:32.193
I GET IT.

01:32.226 --> 01:34.462
IF WE DO SOMETHING
NICE FOR THEM,

01:34.495 --> 01:36.530
THEY HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING NICE FOR US.

01:36.564 --> 01:39.300
- LIKE GIVE US PRESENTS.
- YES.

01:39.333 --> 01:43.471
WHY CAN'T WE JUST DO IT
BECAUSE WE LOVE THEM?

01:43.504 --> 01:46.374
BECAUSE THEN WE DON'T
GET STUFF. DUH.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.279
( rock music playing )

01:51.312 --> 01:52.880
* TODAY'S ALL BURNT TOAST

01:52.913 --> 01:54.415
* RUNNING LATE,
AND DAD SAYS *

01:54.448 --> 01:57.218
* HAS ANYBODY
SEEN MY LEFT SHOE? *

01:57.251 --> 01:59.220
* I CLOSE MY EYES,
TAKE A BITE *

01:59.253 --> 02:01.222
* GRAB A RIDE,
LAUGH OUT LOUD *

02:01.255 --> 02:03.591
* THERE IT IS
UP ON THE ROOF *

02:03.624 --> 02:07.261
* I'VE BEEN THERE,
I'VE SURVIVED *

02:07.295 --> 02:10.331
* SO JUST TAKE
MY ADVICE *

02:10.364 --> 02:12.466
* HANG IN THERE, BABY

02:12.500 --> 02:14.235
* THINGS ARE CRAZY

02:14.268 --> 02:17.171
* BUT I KNOW
YOUR FUTURE'S BRIGHT *

02:17.205 --> 02:19.273
* HANG IN THERE, BABY

02:19.307 --> 02:20.608
* THERE'S NO MAYBE

02:20.641 --> 02:23.511
* EVERYTHING
TURNS OUT ALL RIGHT *

02:23.544 --> 02:26.180
* YOUR LIFE
IS UP AND DOWN *

02:26.214 --> 02:29.383
* BUT TRUST ME,
IT COMES BACK AROUND *

02:29.417 --> 02:33.487
* YOU'RE GONNA LOVE
WHO YOU TURN OUT TO BE *

02:34.988 --> 02:37.525
* HANG IN THERE, BABY.

02:45.266 --> 02:47.268
( Charlie crying )

02:47.635 --> 02:50.604
HEY!

02:50.638 --> 02:53.307
SHOULDN'T SOMEONE GO
TELL CHARLIE TO SHUT UP?

02:54.542 --> 02:56.477
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU GIVE IT A SHOT.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.711
WE'VE BEEN TRYING
ALL NIGHT LONG.

02:57.745 --> 03:00.548
AND BY "WE"
HE MEANS ME.

03:00.581 --> 03:03.484
COME ON, I GOT UP
THAT ONE TIME.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.287
AND WHEN YOU FLUSHED,
YOU WOKE HER UP.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.623
BUT WHY IS SHE
SO FUSSY?

03:09.657 --> 03:12.626
WE CAN'T FIND HER BLANKIE.
AND WE'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE.

03:12.660 --> 03:15.229
OH, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

03:15.263 --> 03:18.632
SHE SHOULDN'T NEED SOMETHING
TO HELP HER SLEEP.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.568
WHAT ABOUT
YOUR STUFFED MONKEY?

03:20.601 --> 03:22.570
( game bleeping )

03:22.603 --> 03:24.772
COCO'S DIFFERENT.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.775
GUYS, WHAT A HORRIBLE WAY
TO SPEND YOUR ANNIVERSARY.

03:27.808 --> 03:30.578
WE SHOULD REALLY
GET OUT OF THE HOUSE.

03:30.611 --> 03:32.680
OW. WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

03:32.713 --> 03:35.249
OH.

03:35.283 --> 03:37.651
MOM AND DAD,
ON YOUR ANNIVERSARY

03:37.685 --> 03:40.321
I'M TAKING YOU
TO LUNCH AND A MOVIE,

03:40.354 --> 03:41.522
MY TREAT.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.657
OH, DAD,
BRING YOUR WALLET.

03:43.691 --> 03:47.295
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
"MY TREAT" MEANS, DO YOU?

03:47.328 --> 03:50.464
OKAY, WE'D LOVE TO GO
TO A MOVIE, KIDS,

03:50.498 --> 03:52.533
BUT NOT WHEN CHARLIE'S
SO UPSET.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.635
I'LL FIND CHARLIE'S BLANKIE
AND TAKE CARE OF HER.

03:54.668 --> 03:57.405
NOW YOU TWO GO OUT
AND ENJOY SOME ALONE TIME

03:57.438 --> 03:59.407
ON YOUR ANNIVERSARY

03:59.440 --> 04:02.610
WITH GABE.

04:02.643 --> 04:04.578
AND I KNOW THE PERFECT
MOVIE TO SEE--

04:04.612 --> 04:08.549
"STAR EXPLODERS II:
TICKING ASTEROIDS" IN 3D.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.784
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THE CRITICS HATED THAT.

04:10.818 --> 04:13.287
- THAT MEANS
IT'S GOTTA BE GOOD.
- OH, YEAH.

04:13.321 --> 04:16.490
OR WE COULD SEE
"THE WILLOW WEEPS TOMORROW."

04:16.524 --> 04:19.059
- WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?
- IT'S A HAUNTING TALE
OF A YOUNG GIRL

04:19.092 --> 04:21.061
WHO LIVES ON A FARM,
PLANTS A WILLOW TREE

04:21.094 --> 04:24.698
AND GROWS UP WITH DREAMS
OF BECOMING A BALLERINA.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.569
AND THEN ON THE DAY
OF THE BIG AUDITION

04:28.602 --> 04:31.071
SHE TWISTS HER ANKLE,
GOES BACK TO THE FARM,

04:31.104 --> 04:33.073
GETS MARRIED
AND HAS A BABY.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.042
AND DO YOU KNOW
WHAT SHE NAMES IT?

04:35.075 --> 04:36.310
( mouths )

04:36.344 --> 04:37.645
WILLOW.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.350
I FEEL LIKE
WE JUST SAW IT.

04:42.383 --> 04:45.719
AND HATED IT.

04:45.753 --> 04:48.589
OH, COME ON, GUYS.
IT'S MY ANNIVERSARY TOO.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.458
NO NO NO, YOU'RE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.059
LOOK, WE DON'T HAVE TO
FIGURE THIS OUT NOW.

04:52.092 --> 04:54.061
WE'LL DECIDE WHEN
WE GET TO THE THEATER.

04:54.094 --> 04:57.331
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

04:57.365 --> 04:59.800
"STAR EXPLODERS"!

05:02.503 --> 05:04.572
( Charlie crying )

05:04.605 --> 05:07.708
CHARLIE, I'M LOOKING
FOR YOUR BLANKIE.
PLEASE STOP CRYING.

05:07.741 --> 05:10.678
- ( jingle playing on TV )
- OH, LOOK, IT'S YOUR
FAVORITE SHOW--

05:10.711 --> 05:13.681
"THE CIRCLES."
THEY'RE THE COLORFUL
SINGING SHAPES

05:13.714 --> 05:17.585
THAT TEACH YOU
ABOUT SHAPES.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.753
* I AM A RED CIRCLE,
YES, I AM *

05:19.787 --> 05:22.723
* I AM BIG AND ROUND
AND RED. *

05:22.756 --> 05:24.725
HEY!

05:24.758 --> 05:27.728
MAN, THIS IS ANNOYING.
( turns off TV )

05:27.761 --> 05:31.865
OH, WHAT'S THIS I FOUND?
IS THIS YOUR BLANKIE?

05:31.899 --> 05:34.735
( crying louder )

05:34.768 --> 05:36.870
I'LL TAKE THAT
AS A NO.

05:36.904 --> 05:38.872
LET'S TAKE YOU
ON A WALK.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.874
THAT'LL MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.910
YAY!

05:57.190 --> 05:59.760
- EXCUSE ME.
- ( chuckling )

05:59.793 --> 06:01.562
EXCUSE ME.

06:04.197 --> 06:07.535
GREAT, I THINK
I'M THE ONLY WOMAN IN HERE.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.537
HEY, WHAT ABOUT--?

06:09.570 --> 06:11.805
NOPE.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.807
I'M KIND OF
GETTING HUNGRY.

06:13.841 --> 06:15.643
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S EAT.

06:15.676 --> 06:18.512
PASS THIS
TO YOUR DAD.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.451
ISN'T THIS GREAT--

06:23.484 --> 06:25.486
NOT HAVING TO BUY
THAT MOVIE THEATER FOOD?

06:25.519 --> 06:26.754
WE'RE SAVING
SO MUCH MONEY.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.756
I GUESS I HAD A DIFFERENT
PICTURE IN MY MIND

06:28.789 --> 06:30.824
WHEN GABE SAID
"LUNCH AND A MOVIE."

06:30.858 --> 06:33.494
I THINK HE SAID
"LUNCH IN A MOVIE."

06:34.762 --> 06:36.396
MOM, DO YOU HAVE
MY MILKSHAKE?

06:37.798 --> 06:39.767
OH.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.769
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK IT'S EASIER

06:41.802 --> 06:44.004
IF YOU JUST
STICK THE STRAW IN.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.441
HEY, THE MOVIE'S
STARTING.

06:47.475 --> 06:50.010
( dramatic music playing )

06:53.814 --> 06:56.550
REALLY?

06:58.018 --> 07:02.856
EXCUSE ME, COULD YOU
TAKE OFF YOUR TENTACLES?

07:06.627 --> 07:08.462
GOT THE CAKE.

07:08.496 --> 07:10.964
WHOA.
WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT?

07:10.998 --> 07:13.734
OH, IT'S THE THEME
FOR TONIGHT'S DINNER.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.869
I TURNED THE LIVING ROOM
INTO A MOROCCAN PALACE.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.838
SO WE'LL BE SERVING
MOROCCAN FOOD?

07:17.871 --> 07:19.673
WON'T THAT MAKE
DAD GASSY?

07:19.707 --> 07:22.610
NAME A COUNTRY
THAT WON'T MAKE DAD GASSY.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.678
GOOD POINT.

07:24.712 --> 07:26.847
ARE YOU STILL LOOKING
FOR CHARLIE'S BLANKIE?

07:26.880 --> 07:29.817
I CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE.
I THOUGHT I PUT IT IN THAT
PILE OF DIRTY CLOTHES.

07:29.850 --> 07:32.786
WE HAVE
A DIRTY CLOTHES PILE?

07:32.820 --> 07:35.789
YEAH, IT'S WHERE
YOUR CLOTHES MAGICALLY GO

07:35.823 --> 07:37.925
AFTER YOU THROW THEM
ON THE FLOOR.

07:37.958 --> 07:41.829
I HOPE YOU DIDN'T PUT IT
ON THE DONATION PILE

07:41.862 --> 07:44.031
FOR THE THRIFT STORE,
'CAUSE THAT IS LONG GONE.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.800
- WE GAVE HER BLANKIE AWAY?
- YOU GAVE HER BLANKIE AWAY.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.836
- WE HAVE TO GET IT BACK.
- YOU HAVE TO GET IT BACK.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.904
- STOP SAYING THAT.
- YOU STOP SAYING THAT.

07:50.938 --> 07:53.741
( laughs )

07:53.774 --> 07:55.976
YOU KNOW,
I'M USUALLY THE ONE
WHO MESSES THINGS UP.

07:56.009 --> 07:59.747
BUT THIS TIME
EVERYTHING ON MY SIDE
OF THE OPERATION

07:59.780 --> 08:01.982
IS GOING JUST FINE.
SEE?

08:04.084 --> 08:06.720
"BON VOYAGE,
ESTHER & MARTY"?

08:06.754 --> 08:09.022
- OOPS.
- YOU BROUGHT HOME
THE WRONG CAKE.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.024
CAN'T WE JUST TELL
MOM AND DAD

08:11.058 --> 08:13.060
THAT "BON VOYAGE"
IS FRENCH FOR
"HAPPY ANNIVERSARY"?

08:13.093 --> 08:14.828
WHAT ABOUT
"ESTHER & MARTY"?

08:14.862 --> 08:16.930
WHO CARES ABOUT THEM?
THEY'RE ON A SHIP.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.667
OKAY, WE STILL HAVE TIME
BEFORE MOM AND DAD GET HOME.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.068
- WE CAN FIX THIS.
- HOW?

08:21.101 --> 08:22.803
YOU DROP ME OFF
AT THE THRIFT STORE.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.938
I'LL GRAB THE BLANKIE
WHILE YOU GO SWITCH CAKES.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.974
LET'S DO IT.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.112
LET'S DO IT
WITH CHARLIE.

08:34.982 --> 08:36.984
( air whooshing )

08:38.586 --> 08:40.554
OH!

08:40.588 --> 08:42.756
YEAH!

08:42.790 --> 08:44.958
THAT WAS AWESOME.

08:44.992 --> 08:46.727
AND DERIVATIVE.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.129
THEY DID IT
IN "SOLAR TROOPERS:
STAR QUEST IV."

08:51.632 --> 08:54.301
HOW MANY STARS HAVE TO EXPLODE
BEFORE THIS THING IS OVER?

08:54.334 --> 08:56.837
10,365,

08:56.870 --> 08:59.139
OR SO THEY SAID
IN THE CHAT ROOM.

09:01.008 --> 09:03.611
HEY, MOM, COULD YOU
JIGGLE YOUR PURSE?

09:03.644 --> 09:05.012
MY SHAKE'S CLOGGING.

09:08.015 --> 09:09.717
( beeping )

09:09.750 --> 09:11.819
HONEY, PUT YOUR PHONE AWAY.
IT'S DISTRACTING.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.621
MY PHONE
IS DISTRACTING

09:13.654 --> 09:15.055
FROM THE 3D DESTRUCTION
OF THE MILKY WAY?

09:15.088 --> 09:17.758
DO YOU MIND?

09:17.791 --> 09:19.059
YOU WERE TALKING TOO.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.929
ABOUT THE MOVIE,
WHICH IS TOTALLY ALLOWED.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.897
OH, YEAH?

09:23.931 --> 09:27.935
HONEY, HONEY,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

09:27.968 --> 09:29.336
OUT.

09:29.369 --> 09:31.905
EXCUSE ME, COULD YOU
MOVE YOUR FLIPPER?

09:32.906 --> 09:34.875
I SHOULD GO
TALK TO HER.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.777
Man:
Mr. President,

09:36.810 --> 09:39.913
only you can give the order
to explode the supernova.

09:39.947 --> 09:43.016
President:
May the galaxy
forgive me.

09:43.050 --> 09:44.151
( explosion )

09:44.184 --> 09:46.186
WHOO!

09:51.825 --> 09:53.661
EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME.

09:53.694 --> 09:56.363
HI, I DONATED SOMETHING
AND I HAVE TO GET IT BACK.

09:56.396 --> 09:58.365
OH, DEAR.

09:58.398 --> 10:02.970
SOMEONE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT
THE WORD "DONATION" MEANS.

10:03.003 --> 10:05.939
SEE, DARLING, WHEN YOU
"DONATE" SOMETHING

10:05.973 --> 10:08.942
YOU "DO NOT"
GET IT BACK.

10:08.976 --> 10:11.044
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS.

10:11.078 --> 10:13.046
I ACCIDENTALLY GAVE AWAY
MY BABY SISTER'S BLANKIE.

10:13.080 --> 10:16.049
YOUR BABY SISTER'S
BLANKIE?!

10:16.083 --> 10:18.852
I STILL DON'T CARE.

10:18.886 --> 10:21.655
DID SOMEONE WAKE UP
ON THE WRONG SIDE
OF THE BED?

10:21.689 --> 10:24.124
I SLEEP ON THE FUTON.
MAMA GETS THE BED.

10:24.157 --> 10:26.660
CAN YOU HELP ME?

10:26.694 --> 10:28.729
I'M AFRAID
IT'S OUT OF MY HANDS.

10:28.762 --> 10:31.765
EVERYTHING THAT
WAS DONATED THIS WEEK
IS ALREADY ON THAT TRUCK.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.000
( phone rings )

10:33.033 --> 10:35.002
LESLIE'S DOG-WASHING
SERVICE.

10:35.035 --> 10:38.005
IF YOUR POOCH IS DIRTY,
I'LL MAKE HIM PURTY.

10:38.038 --> 10:41.041
SIDE BUSINESS.
I'M ALSO A LIFE COACH.

10:41.074 --> 10:43.744
YEAH, UH-HUH.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.185
OH, I THINK I SEE IT.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.125
NO, MA'AM,
WE DON'T WASH CATS.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.193
CATS WASH THEMSELVES.

11:09.136 --> 11:10.270
UH-OH.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.975
( engine starts )

11:16.009 --> 11:18.011
( backup signal beeping )

11:18.045 --> 11:19.980
WAIT, NO.
HOLD IT, NO.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.282
BOOP BOOP BOOP!

11:27.020 --> 11:30.257
THIS IS ZAALOUK,

11:30.290 --> 11:32.726
TAJINE, PASTILLA
AND HARIRA.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.227
ANY QUESTIONS?

11:34.261 --> 11:37.497
ACTUALLY, I DO HAVE A QUESTION.
IS YOUR NAME REALLY AZIZ?

11:37.530 --> 11:40.000
IT IS ON SATURDAYS
BETWEEN 5:00 AND 9:00.

11:40.033 --> 11:43.136
TUESDAYS AND THURSDAYS
I'M RAOUL FROM EL GAUCHO.

11:43.170 --> 11:44.872
OH, COOL.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.874
I'M ALSO IN THE FOOD
DELIVERY BUSINESS.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.075
I WORK FOR
KWIKKI CHIKKI.

11:48.108 --> 11:50.077
YOU MEAN THE GUYS
WHO WEAR THE ROOSTER HAT

11:50.110 --> 11:52.012
WITH THE CARTOON BEAK?

11:52.045 --> 11:55.783
WHERE'S YOUR PRIDE, MAN?

11:55.816 --> 11:57.785
( phone ringing )

11:57.818 --> 12:00.153
GOTTA ANSWER THE PHONE.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.024
- HELLO.
- P.J.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.159
TEDDY, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
I WENT TO THE THRIFT STORE
AND YOU WEREN'T THERE.

12:06.193 --> 12:08.028
I'M LOCKED IN THE BACK
OF A TRUCK.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.764
OOH, THIS IS CUTE.

12:10.798 --> 12:13.200
SOMEONE THREW THIS OUT?

12:13.233 --> 12:16.503
WHAT? TEDDY, I CAN'T HEAR YOU.
TRY GOING OUTSIDE TO GET
BETTER RECEPTION.

12:16.536 --> 12:19.106
IF I COULD GO OUTSIDE,
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO CALL YOU.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.975
OKAY, I HAVE AN IDEA--
WHY DON'T I GO OUTSIDE?

12:25.212 --> 12:27.881
CAN I HEAR YOU NOW?

12:27.915 --> 12:29.082
I'M LOCKED
IN THE BACK OF A TRUCK.

12:29.116 --> 12:31.084
LOCKED IN THE BACK
OF A TRUCK?

12:31.118 --> 12:33.954
TEDDY, HOW COULD YOU
BE SO STUPID?

12:35.222 --> 12:38.892
UM, FORGET THAT QUESTION.
I GOTTA GO.

12:38.926 --> 12:42.262
WAIT, NO.
WAIT, NO.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.064
UM, YEAH.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.266
- CHARLIE, HI.
- ( giggling )

12:46.299 --> 12:48.802
CAN YOU OPEN
THE DOOR FOR ME?

12:48.836 --> 12:51.138
CHARLIE, COME HERE.
CHARLIE, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

12:51.171 --> 12:52.873
CHARLIE, CHARLIE.

12:52.906 --> 12:55.976
CHARLIE, CAN YOU
COME HERE?

12:56.009 --> 12:59.947
THATTAGIRL.
A LITTLE CLOSER.
A LITTLE CLOSER.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.149
CHARLIE, NO.
NO, NOT THE FOOD.

13:02.182 --> 13:04.084
CHARLIE, PLEASE.
PLEASE COME HERE.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.820
CHARLIE, CHARLIE,
HI, HI.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.088
COME HERE.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.190
YES, THATTAGIRL.
THATTAGIRL.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.959
A LITTLE CLOSER.
A LITTLE CLOSER.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.194
( banging )

13:19.166 --> 13:21.168
UGH.

13:23.003 --> 13:26.373
YOU CAN DO THAT,
BUT YOU CAN'T OPEN THE DOOR?

13:39.419 --> 13:41.588
HEY, HONEY, YOU'RE MISSING
THE WHOLE MOVIE.

13:41.621 --> 13:44.925
YEAH, THAT'S KIND OF
THE IDEA.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.194
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
OUT HERE?

13:47.227 --> 13:51.264
THE GUY WITH THE TENTACLES
CUT THE CHEESE.

13:51.298 --> 13:55.635
YEAH, IT WAS THE GUY
WITH THE TENTACLES.

13:55.668 --> 13:59.272
HONEY, WHAT'S WRONG?

13:59.306 --> 14:01.274
I DON'T KNOW.

14:01.308 --> 14:04.177
I GUESS THE TRUTH IS
IT WOULD BE NICE

14:04.211 --> 14:06.146
TO DO MORE
ON OUR ANNIVERSARY.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.648
WE USED TO DO
SPECIAL THINGS.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.984
NOW WE'RE EATING ONION RINGS
OUT OF MY PURSE.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.887
THERE WERE ONION RINGS?

14:13.921 --> 14:15.422
BUT I THOUGHT
WE AGREED

14:15.455 --> 14:17.157
WE WEREN'T GONNA DO
ANYTHING SPECIAL.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.159
YEAH, I KNOW.
I KNOW WE DID.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.894
SO NOW YOU WANT TO DO
SPECIAL THINGS?

14:20.928 --> 14:23.130
WELL, IT'S BETTER THAN
DOING UNSPECIAL THINGS,

14:23.163 --> 14:25.432
LIKE SITTING IN A THEATER
FULL OF 40-YEAR-OLD NERDS.

14:25.465 --> 14:28.168
HEY, I'M ONLY 36.

14:31.939 --> 14:34.307
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:34.341 --> 14:36.910
YOU GUYS GO BACK
AND ENJOY YOUR MOVIE

14:36.944 --> 14:39.012
AND I'M GONNA GO SEE
"THE WILLOW WEEPS TOMORROW."

14:39.046 --> 14:42.315
NO, HONEY, WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.

14:42.349 --> 14:44.351
ARE YOU GONNA WANT
THE ONION RINGS OR--?

14:46.954 --> 14:48.922
HERE YOU GO.

14:48.956 --> 14:51.458
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY.

14:54.494 --> 14:58.065
I DON'T THINK
I HANDLED THAT VERY WELL.

14:58.098 --> 15:01.068
YA THINK?

15:01.101 --> 15:03.470
OH, MAN.

15:03.503 --> 15:06.439
I SHOULD HAVE
PLANNED SOMETHING.

15:06.473 --> 15:08.675
- WELL, MAYBE YOU DID.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

15:08.708 --> 15:11.211
WELL, TEDDY, P.J. AND I
ARE SURPRISING YOU GUYS

15:11.244 --> 15:12.479
WITH AN ANNIVERSARY
DINNER.

15:12.512 --> 15:15.148
IT WAS ALL MY IDEA,
NOT TEDDY'S.

15:17.317 --> 15:20.087
BUT I CAN LET YOU
TAKE THE CREDIT.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.355
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
YOU'D DO THAT FOR ME?

15:22.389 --> 15:25.192
SURE. JUST REMEMBER ME
ON GABE'S DAY.

15:25.225 --> 15:28.328
- WHAT'S GABE'S DAY?
- SURPRISE ME.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.503
AGH! AN ARM!

15:36.536 --> 15:39.039
MY GOODNESS, PEOPLE WILL
DONATE ANYTHING.

15:39.072 --> 15:41.708
A LITTLE HELP HERE.

15:41.741 --> 15:44.177
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN THE BACK OF MY TRUCK?

15:44.211 --> 15:46.746
LOOKING FOR
MY SISTER'S BLANKIE.
AND IT'S NOT IN HERE,

15:46.779 --> 15:49.983
ALTHOUGH I DID FIND THIS
REALLY CUTE TOP, SEE?

15:50.017 --> 15:51.985
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD
LOOK GOOD WITH THAT?

15:52.019 --> 15:53.987
GET OUT OF MY TRUCK!

15:54.021 --> 15:55.989
BUT I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE I AM.

15:56.023 --> 15:57.991
YOU'RE IN THE DRIVEWAY
OF MY HOUSE.

15:58.025 --> 16:00.760
MAMA ALWAYS LIKES
FIRST DIBS ON MY PILE.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.430
WAIT, AND YOU STILL HAVE
TO SLEEP ON THE FUTON?

16:03.463 --> 16:04.998
THAT JUST DOESN'T
SEEM RIGHT.

16:05.032 --> 16:08.235
WOULD YOU MIND
TELLING THAT TO MY MAMA?

16:11.404 --> 16:14.441
CHARLIE, PLEASE
OPEN THE DOOR.

16:19.312 --> 16:22.015
OPEN WINDOW.

16:33.593 --> 16:36.263
HA HA!
COMING, CHARLIE.

16:49.309 --> 16:51.344
( laughing )

16:54.181 --> 16:56.583
( dramatic music playing )

16:56.616 --> 16:59.152
THIS IS SO SAD.

16:59.186 --> 17:02.555
I KNOW.

17:02.589 --> 17:05.192
FIRST SHE LOSES
HER MAN,

17:05.225 --> 17:09.062
AND NOW HER SENSE
OF SMELL.

17:09.096 --> 17:12.799
HER PROBLEM IS
SHE LOVES TOO MUCH.

17:12.832 --> 17:15.368
I SMELL OSCAR.

17:15.402 --> 17:18.071
BUT SHE WON'T.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.815
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

17:28.848 --> 17:32.085
- I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
- AND OUR MOVIE ENDED.

17:32.119 --> 17:34.354
OW!

17:34.387 --> 17:36.823
LOOK, HONEY, I WASN'T
GONNA TELL YOU THIS,

17:36.856 --> 17:40.627
BUT I'VE GOT
AN ANNIVERSARY SURPRISE
WAITING FOR YOU AT HOME.

17:40.660 --> 17:43.530
REALLY?
WHAT IS IT?

17:43.563 --> 17:46.833
IF I TOLD YOU,
IT WOULDN'T BE MUCH OF
A SURPRISE NOW, WOULD IT?

17:46.866 --> 17:48.435
OH.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.370
I LOVE YOU.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.305
( music swells )

17:52.339 --> 17:56.443
( sobbing )

17:56.476 --> 18:00.380
THANKS FOR STAYING
AND WATCHING THE REST
OF THE MOVIE WITH ME.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.649
OH.

18:02.682 --> 18:05.352
OKAY.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.423
WHY DO I HAVE TO STAY?

18:10.457 --> 18:13.626
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T,
GABE'S DAY IS CANCELED.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.273
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

18:26.306 --> 18:28.275
I HAVE A HEART
AS WELL AS A BRAIN.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.277
I'M NOT A ROBOT.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.111
I WISH I WAS.

18:33.713 --> 18:37.617
HEY, DAD, DO YOU WANT
TO SWITCH SEATS?

18:46.426 --> 18:49.896
SO THEN
I LEFT BROADWAY.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.898
I'VE NEVER LOOKED BACK.

18:51.931 --> 18:56.169
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DIDN'T
FIND CHARLIE'S BLANKIE.

18:56.203 --> 18:58.171
I COULD HAVE SWORN

18:58.205 --> 18:59.939
I LOOKED AT EVERY SINGLE
THING IN THAT TRUCK.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.375
WERE YOU EVEN LISTENING
TO MY LIFE'S STORY?

19:02.409 --> 19:05.445
DOES THE NAME PATTI LuPONE
MEAN NOTHING TO YOU?

19:05.478 --> 19:08.181
I'M SORRY,
I JUST--

19:08.215 --> 19:10.717
- WHAT ARE YOU SITTING ON?
- JUST A LITTLE BLANKET.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.186
NO, THAT'S CHARLIE'S BLANKIE.
GIVE ME THAT!

19:13.220 --> 19:15.188
OH, THERE.

19:15.222 --> 19:16.489
WHY WERE YOU
SITTING ON IT?

19:16.523 --> 19:18.691
( clears throat )
HOW SHALL I PUT THIS?

19:18.725 --> 19:22.729
I HAVE A MEDICAL CONDITION
KNOWN AS POSTERIAL HYDROSIS.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.332
- WHAT'S THAT?
- BUTT SWEATS.

19:26.766 --> 19:28.435
EWW.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.370
WELL, AT LEAST
I GOT IT BACK.

19:32.739 --> 19:34.707
STOP THE TRUCK.
BACK IT UP.

19:34.741 --> 19:37.210
BOOP BOOP BOOP!

19:38.978 --> 19:41.348
OKAY, LOOK, BEFORE WE GO IN
I JUST WANT TO SAY SOMETHING.

19:41.381 --> 19:45.518
NOW I KNOW I'M NOT ALWAYS
THE MOST ROMANTIC GUY,

19:45.552 --> 19:48.388
BUT I SHOULD BE,
BECAUSE YOU DESERVE IT.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.792
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!

19:56.263 --> 19:58.598
SURPRISE!

19:58.631 --> 20:01.534
OH, CHARLIE.

20:01.568 --> 20:03.236
WHAT HAPPENED?

20:03.270 --> 20:07.274
ASK DAD. HE PLANNED
THE WHOLE THING.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.748
FOR YOUR ANNIVERSARY
WE'D LIKE TO SERVE YOU

20:15.782 --> 20:17.517
A TRADITIONAL
MOROCCAN FEAST.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.786
BUT SINCE THAT ENDED UP
ON THE FLOOR,

20:19.819 --> 20:21.688
WE BRING YOU...

20:21.721 --> 20:24.524
PEANUT BUTTER TOAST.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.559
THIS IS SO SWEET
OF YOU KIDS.

20:26.593 --> 20:28.561
YOU KNOW, I THINK
THIS TURNED OUT TO BE

20:28.595 --> 20:30.397
A PRETTY GREAT
ANNIVERSARY AFTER ALL.

20:30.430 --> 20:33.633
I DON'T EVEN MIND THAT
I'M SITTING IN COUSCOUS.

20:33.666 --> 20:36.269
AND NOW IT'S TIME
FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT.

20:36.303 --> 20:39.372
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
MAY I PRESENT TO YOU...

20:39.406 --> 20:41.474
THE DANCING DUNCANS!

20:58.057 --> 20:59.426
Isn't it amazing
how a little piece of cloth

20:59.459 --> 21:01.328
can make someone
so happy,

21:01.361 --> 21:05.498
even when it's covered in
tire tracks and butt sweat?

21:05.532 --> 21:08.701
I'm gonna wash it
after you fall asleep.

21:08.735 --> 21:12.372
But it's so funny,
blankies so much,ur

21:12.405 --> 21:14.641
and then one day
we forget all about them.

21:14.674 --> 21:17.777
And if you're like me,
by the time you're five.

21:19.846 --> 21:21.848
Good night.

21:27.387 --> 21:29.356
But if you're like Gabe,

21:29.389 --> 21:32.425
you might bring it
on your honeymoon.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.428
Good luck, Charlie.

21:42.469 --> 21:44.371
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M KIND OF HUNGRY.

21:46.573 --> 21:47.807
PASS THIS TO YOUR DAD.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.610
ANYTHING ELSE?

21:53.613 --> 21:56.649
I HAD CHICKEN YESTERDAY.
GOT ANYTHING ELSE?

22:02.422 --> 22:03.590
WHAT, NO FIXINGS?

22:03.623 --> 22:05.658
HOLD ON.

22:10.530 --> 22:13.400
HEY, HONEY, AREN'T YOU
GONNA HAVE SOMETHING?

22:13.433 --> 22:15.468
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

22:17.504 --> 22:19.872
OKAY,

22:19.906 --> 22:22.909
WHO ORDERED NACHOS?

22:22.942 --> 22:24.411
THAT WOULD BE ME.

22:24.444 --> 22:26.413
SHH.
