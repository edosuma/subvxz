00:08.333 --> 00:10.167
- Hey, bro, I swiped
some lunches

00:10.267 --> 00:12.200
from the teachers' lounge.

00:12.300 --> 00:16.767
You want Bradford's bagel bites
or Senor Noodleman's noodles?

00:16.867 --> 00:18.100
- Thanks, buddy,

00:18.200 --> 00:20.267
but I got a special lunch
planned with Allison.

00:20.367 --> 00:22.933
I even reserved the
bubblegum-free bench.

00:23.033 --> 00:25.700
Hey! Don't you dare
gum that bench.

00:29.500 --> 00:32.533
- Hey there, all you
hip cats and dolls,

00:32.633 --> 00:34.800
it's your favorite
teacher, Mr. Schecter

00:34.900 --> 00:38.633
bringing you some drama
for yo' mama.

00:40.867 --> 00:42.100
- Curtains up, people.

00:42.200 --> 00:44.667
The drama club is casting
its latest play.

00:44.767 --> 00:46.400
- "A Kiss From My Angel,"

00:46.500 --> 00:49.067
so if you wanna be a star
auditions are tomorrow.

00:49.167 --> 00:53.200
- Until then...stay jazzy!

00:53.300 --> 00:58.133
- STUDENTS:

00:58.233 --> 00:59.767
- Hey, I didn't know Allison
was in the drama club.

00:59.867 --> 01:03.667
- Till a minute ago I didn't
know we had a drama club.

01:03.767 --> 01:05.767
- You worried about her getting
the leading role in the play?

01:05.867 --> 01:09.167
- Till a minute ago I didn't
know this school did plays.

01:09.267 --> 01:11.967
- Well, as her boyfriend,
you should be worried.

01:12.067 --> 01:13.300
It's Nate Lockhart.

01:13.400 --> 01:15.533
He always get the lead
and the leading ladies.

01:15.633 --> 01:18.200
They always fall for him even if
they already have a boyfriend.

01:18.300 --> 01:21.100
- Yeah, do not trust him
around your girlfriend.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.167
That guy's a snake.

01:23.267 --> 01:27.067
Hey, yo, Nate,
you like noodles?

01:27.167 --> 01:30.633
What? I don't have
a girlfriend.

01:30.733 --> 01:33.567
- You think I care about some
dude in drama club?

01:33.667 --> 01:34.833
Allison and I are fine.

01:34.933 --> 01:37.300
- Hasn't she canceled lunch
three times this week?

01:37.400 --> 01:40.667
- Max, I have to cancel
lunch today.

01:40.767 --> 01:43.067
- Four times this week.

01:43.133 --> 01:44.967
- I have to rehearse
for my audition.

01:45.067 --> 01:47.633
If I'm lucky I'll be
Nate's next leading lady.

01:47.733 --> 01:49.533
Oh, he is so hot right now.

01:49.633 --> 01:50.867
- Uh, excuse me.

01:50.967 --> 01:54.333
- You know, his public school
drama career is on fire

01:54.433 --> 01:56.767
and I wanna be close enough
to catch some of that heat!

01:59.333 --> 02:01.267
Talk to you later.

02:04.267 --> 02:08.433
- Nate's on fire, but you're
the one who got burned.

02:09.633 --> 02:11.767
- *

02:11.867 --> 02:13.067
* What you see

02:13.133 --> 02:14.500
* Is not what you get

02:14.600 --> 02:17.800
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

02:17.900 --> 02:19.367
* We fit right in

02:19.467 --> 02:21.067
* Bet you never guessed

02:21.167 --> 02:22.367
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

02:22.467 --> 02:24.167
* Just like all the rest

02:24.267 --> 02:25.933
* A picture
perfect family *

02:26.067 --> 02:28.067
* Is what we try to be

02:28.133 --> 02:29.200
* Look closer,
you might see *

02:29.300 --> 02:31.067
* The crazy things we do

02:31.133 --> 02:32.733
* This isn't
make believe *

02:32.833 --> 02:34.300
* It's our reality

02:34.400 --> 02:35.700
* Just your average family

02:35.800 --> 02:38.967
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

02:39.067 --> 02:42.633
* Livin' a double life *

02:46.067 --> 02:50.067
- *

02:53.367 --> 02:54.933
- Hey, girls.

02:55.067 --> 02:56.467
Just, uh...

02:56.567 --> 03:00.167
Uh, Hattie, have I ever told
you how awesome you are?

03:00.267 --> 03:03.200
And Roxy, you're amazing.

03:03.300 --> 03:05.567
- Max, why are you lying
to my friends?

03:07.633 --> 03:09.600
You know what I mean.

03:10.833 --> 03:12.800
- You two should
totally audition

03:12.900 --> 03:14.900
for the female lead in
the drama club's play.

03:15.067 --> 03:17.167
- I can't audition.
I get stage fright.

03:17.267 --> 03:19.467
- And I get stage rage.

03:19.567 --> 03:22.533
Don't ask!

03:26.200 --> 03:32.400
- So, Phoebe, have I ever told
you how amazing you are?

03:32.500 --> 03:33.933
- Ha ha, Max.

03:34.067 --> 03:36.167
I know you don't want Allison to
get the lead and fall for Nate,

03:36.267 --> 03:39.800
so if you want me to audition,
you know what you gotta do.

03:39.900 --> 03:41.500
- Ugh, fine.

03:44.467 --> 03:46.567
Listen up, everyone!

03:46.667 --> 03:48.533
Phoebe is the best sister,

03:48.633 --> 03:50.833
and you're all lucky to
have her as a friend.

03:50.933 --> 03:52.567
#TeamPhoebe.

03:55.767 --> 03:58.833
- Okay, I just wanted
you to say "Please,"

03:58.933 --> 04:00.300
but that works, too.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.267
- Wow, I didn't think
it'd be that easy.

04:02.367 --> 04:03.667
What's your angle?
- No angle.

04:03.767 --> 04:05.900
I happen to like
you with Allison.

04:06.067 --> 04:08.167
I'm actually surprised
it's lasted this long.

04:08.267 --> 04:09.867
I mean like shocked.

04:09.967 --> 04:12.300
She's like so nice and pretty
and you're like you.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.100
- Okay, I get it!

04:18.300 --> 04:20.833
- NORA: Here he comes.
Ask him.

04:20.933 --> 04:23.067
- Hey, Dad, do you
go to the bathroom

04:23.133 --> 04:25.333
standing up or sitting down?

04:25.433 --> 04:27.567
- Neither.

04:30.733 --> 04:32.667
- What he meant was...

04:32.767 --> 04:34.933
can you build us
a playhouse?

04:35.067 --> 04:36.600
- I'd love to.

04:36.700 --> 04:38.767
You guys can play in it for
a week and then forget about it,

04:38.867 --> 04:41.600
a bunch of rats will move in,
I'll have to tear it down.

04:41.700 --> 04:43.367
Ooh, I'll accidentally
poke myself

04:43.467 --> 04:45.700
with a rusty nail
and get lockjaw.

04:45.800 --> 04:48.433
Ha ha ha, I can't wait.

04:48.533 --> 04:53.300
- Sweet! We're getting
a playhouse.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.967
- Your brain's a playhouse.

04:57.300 --> 04:59.233
I'll build it for you.

04:59.333 --> 05:02.567
- Sorry, Chloe, you can't build
a playhouse with cuteness.

05:02.667 --> 05:05.400
- Nora, Dad says you can.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.167
- Come on, maybe Mom
will do it,

05:10.267 --> 05:12.200
but you ask this time.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.333
- Hey, Mom, can you
build us a playhouse?

05:18.433 --> 05:21.433
- Billy!
Don't ask her that.

05:21.533 --> 05:24.600
- But you just said.

05:24.700 --> 05:28.067
- You know Dad said Mom wasn't
very good with tools

05:28.100 --> 05:31.067
so we shouldn't ask her.

05:33.433 --> 05:36.067
- But he said not
to say anything.

05:36.100 --> 05:39.100
Please don't tell him
Billy blew it.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.567
- Of course not.

05:40.667 --> 05:42.600
So, you kids want
a playhouse, huh?

05:42.700 --> 05:46.600
- I'm not sure what's
going on anymore.

05:46.700 --> 05:49.167
- Well, I would be happy
to build one for you.

05:49.267 --> 05:52.900
Let me just go find those tools
I'm "not very good with."

05:56.767 --> 05:58.900
- Okay, Max, I'm ready to
practice for my audition.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.433
- Oh, good, I brought
in a celebrated actor

06:01.533 --> 06:02.900
to help you prepare.

06:03.067 --> 06:05.300
- Please tell me it's
a Hemsworth brother.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.700
- Even furrier.

06:09.067 --> 06:13.200
- Romeo, Romeo, wherefore
art thou, Romeo?

06:13.300 --> 06:17.133
- Oh, maybe Romeo left--
just like I'm about to.

06:17.233 --> 06:18.667
- No, wait.

06:18.767 --> 06:20.367
Seriously, Colosso's
really good.

06:20.467 --> 06:22.067
He could help you
get the lead.

06:22.167 --> 06:25.300
- And if you think you can do
better, let's see it.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.067
- Fine.

06:31.767 --> 06:33.700
Romeo! Romeo!

06:33.800 --> 06:36.733
Wherefore art thou?

06:36.833 --> 06:39.500
Romeo?

06:39.600 --> 06:43.300
- Oh, no, she's terrible.

06:43.400 --> 06:44.867
- Give her a break.

06:44.967 --> 06:46.700
No, seriously,
go over there

06:46.800 --> 06:48.800
and break every
bone in her body.

06:51.767 --> 06:55.633
- Barb, are you building
the kids a playhouse?

06:55.733 --> 06:57.567
- Yeah, despite the rumor,

06:57.667 --> 07:00.300
it turns out I'm pretty
good with tools.

07:02.667 --> 07:04.433
- Of course you are--

07:04.533 --> 07:06.567
except I would've used
screws not nails.

07:06.667 --> 07:07.900
They last longer.

07:08.067 --> 07:09.700
- Not what the directions
say, Hank!

07:09.800 --> 07:11.833
- Well, sometimes you just
gotta follow your instincts.

07:11.933 --> 07:15.067
Sorry, can't hear you!

07:15.133 --> 07:18.133
I'm too busy using
this hammer properly.

07:18.233 --> 07:19.900
- Just trying to help.

07:20.067 --> 07:22.100
- I think we might be able to
get two playhouses out of this.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.733
Follow my lead.

07:30.767 --> 07:33.067
- This isn't what
you meant. Got it.

07:34.833 --> 07:35.967
- I wish there was
a way to know

07:36.067 --> 07:38.533
who could build
a better playhouse--

07:38.633 --> 07:41.167
By the Book Barb
or Freestylin' Hank.

07:41.267 --> 07:44.533
- I don't know. Mom's already
got a head start.

07:44.633 --> 07:47.067
There's no way Dad
could catch up.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.800
- Yeah, it's not like
he could fly away

07:48.900 --> 07:51.667
and be back with an armful
of lumber in 30 seconds.

07:51.767 --> 07:55.833
- Fifteen!
Freestylin' Hank, away!

08:06.333 --> 08:08.933
- Hi, I'm Allison and I'll
be doing a monologue

08:09.067 --> 08:13.533
from the hit teen military
comedy "Sergeant Selfie."

08:13.633 --> 08:17.467
OMG! Today was my first day
at boot camp and guess what?

08:17.567 --> 08:22.333
These are the worst boots ever!

08:22.433 --> 08:24.500
- Gouda, Gouda, Gouda!
Buddha, Buddha, Buddha!

08:24.600 --> 08:26.767
Blah, blah, blah!

08:26.867 --> 08:28.633
- Allison's out
there nailing it

08:28.733 --> 08:30.967
and you're back here
practicing barfs?

08:31.067 --> 08:33.633
- I'm not barfing.
This is a training exercise.

08:33.733 --> 08:34.933
- But you have to do great,

08:35.067 --> 08:36.200
if you wanna beat
Allison for the lead.

08:36.300 --> 08:38.067
So remember, everything
you did in my lair,

08:38.133 --> 08:39.567
don't do that.

08:39.667 --> 08:42.733
- Just leave me alone.
I got this.

08:42.833 --> 08:45.333
- AUDIENCE:

08:48.633 --> 08:51.067
- Hi, I'm Phoebe Thunderman and
I'll be performing a monologue--

08:51.167 --> 08:52.967
- Hold!

08:53.067 --> 08:55.267
You call those angel wings?

08:55.367 --> 08:59.067
I've seen prettier feathers
on truck stop pigeons.

08:59.133 --> 09:00.933
Pencil!

09:03.667 --> 09:05.300
- Stand up straight.
You're slouching.

09:05.400 --> 09:07.767
- Helping you.

09:07.867 --> 09:10.267
Now move into the light.

09:10.367 --> 09:13.233
Ugh, gross, your elbows
look way bigger now.

09:13.333 --> 09:15.067
- Stop it!

09:15.167 --> 09:17.100
I can do this without you.

09:17.200 --> 09:18.900
For once in your life
just trust me.

09:19.067 --> 09:21.067
I know it's hard for you,
but you have no choice,

09:21.167 --> 09:23.333
'cause I'm the one up here,
I'm the one doing the work.

09:23.433 --> 09:25.200
I'm the one who's gonna
crush it, all for you,

09:25.300 --> 09:27.267
so just go back in
the hole you crawled out of

09:27.367 --> 09:28.767
and leave me alone.

09:28.867 --> 09:31.467
- I've seen enough!

09:31.567 --> 09:34.500
Ha, no, that wasn't--

09:34.600 --> 09:36.267
- Next!

09:43.067 --> 09:45.267
- Oh, I'm too nervous.
I can't do it. You look.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.133
- Yes!

09:51.233 --> 09:52.967
- No-o-o.

09:58.700 --> 10:01.100
- Oh, oh, oh,
of course you did.

10:01.200 --> 10:04.600
Your monologue was amazing.

10:04.700 --> 10:06.000
It was like you were
talking directly to

10:06.100 --> 10:08.200
the person you hate the most.

10:10.033 --> 10:17.467
A star is born and her name
is Poobie Tinderman!

10:17.567 --> 10:19.467
- It's, uh,
Phoebe Thunderman.

10:19.567 --> 10:22.367
- Change it!

10:24.867 --> 10:27.500
- I'm looking forward to
working with you, Phoebe.

10:29.533 --> 10:31.867
I'll see you at rehearsals.

10:35.867 --> 10:38.800
- So, you get to be angel
number three, huh?

10:38.900 --> 10:40.333
Well, that'll be cool.

10:40.433 --> 10:44.233
You get to wear a halo,
some wings, do angel stuff.

10:44.333 --> 10:46.567
Yeah, I read the play.

10:46.667 --> 10:48.833
- Well, thanks for being so
mature about this, Max.

10:48.933 --> 10:51.067
It makes me realize
I'm with the right guy.

10:51.167 --> 10:53.067
- Hey, I'd support you
no matter how small

10:53.167 --> 10:56.000
and meaningless your part is.

10:56.100 --> 10:57.767
- I'm talking about
you being so cool

10:57.867 --> 11:00.133
with me having a big
kissing scene with Nate.

11:00.233 --> 11:02.467
I'm catching that heat!

11:07.800 --> 11:10.067
- I should've read the play.

11:15.833 --> 11:17.733
- I should've read the play.
I should've read the play.

11:17.833 --> 11:20.500
- Dude, congrats. I heard Phoebe
got the lead in the play.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.067
You got what you wanted.

11:22.100 --> 11:23.733
- Yeah, but Allison
got angel number three

11:23.833 --> 11:25.567
and has to kiss Nate.

11:25.667 --> 11:27.433
That's not what you wanted.

11:27.533 --> 11:30.833
- We both know what will
happen if she kisses him.

11:36.233 --> 11:38.567
- You may now
kiss the bride.

11:38.667 --> 11:40.533
- Ha! Been there, done that.

11:49.667 --> 11:52.300
- This is a nightmare.
- I know.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.500
I can't believe they're
gonna ride off together

11:54.600 --> 11:56.800
on a talking dragon.

11:56.900 --> 11:58.333
- Phoebe!

11:58.433 --> 12:01.667
Why didn't you tell me angel
number three kisses Nate?

12:01.767 --> 12:02.900
- You should've read the play.

12:03.067 --> 12:05.067
- I know I should've
read the play!

12:05.133 --> 12:06.667
How are we gonna fix this?

12:06.767 --> 12:08.500
- It's just a stupid kiss.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.300
It's not like Nate and Allison
are gonna fall for each other

12:10.400 --> 12:12.467
and get married in
a high school hallway.

12:12.567 --> 12:14.333
- It could happen!

12:14.433 --> 12:16.500
- Relax, Max. This is
all in your head.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.833
Nate's only interested
in leading ladies,

12:18.933 --> 12:22.067
and hello, leading lady.

12:22.133 --> 12:23.933
- Phoebe, Phoebe!
- Roxy!

12:24.067 --> 12:25.500
- We're here entourage now.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.400
We do not call her
by her first name.

12:27.500 --> 12:31.233
- Guys, I know having an
entourage is one of my perks,

12:31.333 --> 12:33.433
being the star and all,

12:33.533 --> 12:35.633
but I'm still
the same old Phoebe--

12:35.733 --> 12:40.133
just without a chai latte
in my hand, thank you.

12:40.233 --> 12:43.100
- Nate, wants to run lines
with you over lunch.

12:43.200 --> 12:46.700
He even reserved the
bubblegum-free bench.

12:48.233 --> 12:51.200
See, Max? That silly
kiss won't even matter.

12:51.300 --> 12:55.333
The big stars always wanna
be with other big stars.

12:55.433 --> 12:57.267
It's just the natural
order of things.

12:57.367 --> 13:00.300
Just like how wherever I go,
my entourage follows.

13:03.100 --> 13:05.067
Guys!

13:05.133 --> 13:07.867
- Oh, right, sorry!

13:07.967 --> 13:09.833
Phoebe's wrong.

13:09.933 --> 13:12.167
This is not all in my head.

13:15.300 --> 13:18.300
- Who's got two lips and is
about to kiss your girlfriend?

13:35.667 --> 13:38.233
- It doesn't matter
how I got here.

13:38.333 --> 13:41.133
What matters is that
I'm with you now.

13:41.233 --> 13:43.067
- You must hide.

13:43.133 --> 13:49.067
No one at Angel Prom can
know you are not an angel.

13:49.133 --> 13:51.167
- Silence!

13:51.267 --> 13:53.567
I mean, take five.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.700
- Why do we always take
fives during my scenes?

13:55.800 --> 13:58.367
- Because I can hear you
through the ear plugs.

14:00.467 --> 14:03.767
- Ignore Schecter.
I dig your method.

14:03.867 --> 14:07.600
It's so real.
You're my perfect leading lady.

14:10.333 --> 14:14.200
- Great job, Phoebe.
- Cool death scene.

14:14.300 --> 14:16.967
- Wait, that wasn't
a death scene.

14:17.067 --> 14:20.067
- Told you.

14:20.133 --> 14:21.800
- Let's do the final scene.

14:21.900 --> 14:26.267
Nate, this is when you
find love and kiss Allison.

14:26.367 --> 14:28.467
Angel number three,
pucker up.

14:31.700 --> 14:36.267
- Will you make me the happiest
non

14:36.367 --> 14:40.300
- Yes, Seth from
Kentucky, yes!

14:40.400 --> 14:43.267
- Not on my watch.

14:43.367 --> 14:46.067
- [column thuds,
sphere rolls]

14:46.133 --> 14:47.867
- Whoa, that was weird.

14:47.967 --> 14:49.833
Allison, are you okay?

14:49.933 --> 14:51.333
- Max, what are
you doing here?

14:51.433 --> 14:53.100
- Well, I signed up
to be a stagehand

14:53.200 --> 14:56.800
to support my girlfriend
and all her acting buddies.

14:56.900 --> 14:59.433
Hey, Nate!

14:59.533 --> 15:01.067
- Excuse you.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.800
We're trying to rehearse
the big kiss.

15:02.900 --> 15:06.400
Step aside, stagehand.

15:06.500 --> 15:09.200
Let's try that
big kiss again.

15:09.300 --> 15:11.367
And action!

15:11.467 --> 15:15.133
- Yes, Seth from
Kentucky, yes!

15:21.133 --> 15:24.367
- Amateurs.
Am I right, Mr. Schecter?

15:24.467 --> 15:26.400
- What are you
talking about?

15:26.500 --> 15:28.400
- Well, I don't need to
tell an experienced

15:28.500 --> 15:31.433
theater person like you--
it's obviously bad luck

15:31.533 --> 15:33.367
to rehearse a kiss
before opening night.

15:33.467 --> 15:35.133
You know, the kiss curse.

15:35.233 --> 15:37.100
I mean, look what
just happened.

15:37.200 --> 15:39.333
- Of course, the kiss curse.

15:39.433 --> 15:42.733
Yes, one of the biggies
and I know all about it

15:42.833 --> 15:44.533
because I didn't lie about

15:44.633 --> 15:48.167
my theater experience
to get this job.

15:48.267 --> 15:50.667
- Okay, so we're not
rehearsing the kiss?

15:50.767 --> 15:53.067
- Keep up, amateur.

15:53.100 --> 15:55.267
No kiss until opening night!

15:55.367 --> 15:57.500
- The director has spoken!

16:04.600 --> 16:07.200
- Fooling Mom and Dad
was easier than I thought.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.567
- I know, we got
two playhouses.

16:09.667 --> 16:11.867
Someone should put our pictures
up in the Kids Hall of Fame.

16:11.967 --> 16:14.133
- Yeah, after we get
Mom and Dad to build it.

16:18.533 --> 16:27.767
- *

16:27.867 --> 16:31.067
- So, here we are, Nate,
opening night.

16:33.700 --> 16:36.267
Why does that
keep happening?

16:36.367 --> 16:38.433
- I have a few ideas.

16:42.633 --> 16:46.433
- Listen, there's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

16:46.533 --> 16:47.733
- Oh, Nate, I'm flattered,

16:47.833 --> 16:50.500
but, uh, I can't string
you along anymore.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.833
There's never gonna
be an "us."

16:52.933 --> 16:54.733
- Yeah, duh!

16:54.833 --> 16:57.533
- I'm glad you understa--
Wait, what?

16:57.633 --> 17:00.800
- Phoebe, you're cute and all,
but you're just not my type.

17:00.900 --> 17:03.633
I like girls who are
into theater.

17:03.733 --> 17:06.667
- I'm literally in the play.

17:06.767 --> 17:08.300
- Oh, sorry, I didn't finish.

17:08.400 --> 17:12.433
I like girls who are into
theater and can act.

17:12.533 --> 17:16.867
- Wow, I thought you said I was
the perfect leading lady.

17:16.967 --> 17:18.367
- I did.

17:18.467 --> 17:20.067
I couldn't have you quit
and jeopardize the play.

17:20.133 --> 17:23.500
Then I wouldn't get to kiss
Allison and steal her from Max.

17:23.600 --> 17:25.800
I just wanted to ask which
breath spray I should use--

17:25.900 --> 17:27.933
lime or mint?

17:28.067 --> 17:29.733
I'll use both.

17:29.833 --> 17:32.900
It's gonna be
a lo-o-o-ong kiss.

17:41.333 --> 17:42.867
- Oh, no, Mom and Dad
are so old

17:42.967 --> 17:46.633
they forgot they were supposed
to build two playhouses.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.167
- Actually,
your father and I

17:48.267 --> 17:50.467
put aside our creative
differences...

17:50.567 --> 17:54.133
- ...and decided to make one,
big beautiful house.

17:54.233 --> 17:56.267
- Call before you come visit.

17:56.367 --> 17:59.067
- For Chloe.

17:59.133 --> 18:01.067
- You blew it, baby!

18:04.667 --> 18:05.867
- That'll teach
you not to play

18:05.967 --> 18:08.200
your mother and me
against each other.

18:08.300 --> 18:10.900
- That's right.
We heard everything.

18:12.467 --> 18:14.300
- You two go get ready
for Phoebe's play.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.133
- We have to go to
Phoebe's play?

18:16.233 --> 18:18.800
Haven't we been
punished enough?

18:20.933 --> 18:22.333
- Max.

18:22.433 --> 18:24.267
- I wasn't gonna drop
a ladder on Nate.

18:24.367 --> 18:25.800
Oh, it's you.

18:25.900 --> 18:27.733
- Max, you were right.
Nate really is after Allison.

18:27.833 --> 18:30.067
- That's what I've
been telling you.

18:30.133 --> 18:32.900
Now, use those pointy elbows to
help me cut some of these ropes.

18:33.067 --> 18:35.767
- No, I have another way
to shut down the play.

18:35.867 --> 18:40.200
They can't go on with the show
without their...leading lady!

18:40.300 --> 18:43.733
- Great idea.

18:43.833 --> 18:46.667
This is gonna hurt.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:46.767 --> 18:50.967
No, I'm gonna fix
this with acting.

18:51.067 --> 18:54.167
- Ugh.

18:54.267 --> 18:57.567
- Just go tell Allison I'm sick
and the play is canceled.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.067
- I already cut them loose.

19:01.167 --> 19:03.633
It's worth it if it means
you get to keep Allison.

19:03.733 --> 19:08.367
I miss them, but to be honest
their chai lattes were all foam.

19:08.467 --> 19:11.567
- Thanks.

19:11.667 --> 19:13.333
Allison, there you are.

19:13.433 --> 19:15.067
Bad news.
The play's canceled.

19:15.100 --> 19:19.633
Phoebe's sick and I'm just
so worried about her.

19:19.733 --> 19:22.067
- Yeah, right, stagehand.

19:22.133 --> 19:23.400
I know what's going on.

19:23.500 --> 19:25.733
You've been trying all week to
stop me from kissing Nate.

19:27.567 --> 19:30.067
Is that this play?

19:30.133 --> 19:34.167
- Yes, it's this play.

19:35.900 --> 19:38.200
Fine, I don't want
you to kiss Nate

19:38.300 --> 19:39.800
and marry him in
the school hallway.

19:39.900 --> 19:41.133
There I said it.

19:42.767 --> 19:46.367
For someone so cute, you sure
sound like a dummy.

19:46.467 --> 19:48.833
I really like you
and no stupid kiss

19:48.933 --> 19:51.800
in a high school play
is gonna change that.

19:51.900 --> 19:55.800
- Well, I guess I have
been kind of a...

19:55.900 --> 19:59.300
- The word is "dummy."
- Yeah, that.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.500
But in my defense, I've never
been in a relationship before.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.367
This is all new
territory for me.

20:04.467 --> 20:06.367
- Well, get over it!

20:06.467 --> 20:09.433
We're stuck with each other.

20:14.767 --> 20:17.733
- Mr. Schecter,
I'm not feeling well.

20:17.833 --> 20:23.033
I know the show must go on,
but the fever, oh, the fever.

20:23.133 --> 20:25.800
- That's okay, we'll cancel.

20:25.900 --> 20:27.900
Strike the set!

20:28.000 --> 20:29.400
- Nope, she's fine!

20:29.500 --> 20:31.467
Trust me,
just pre-show jitters.

20:31.567 --> 20:34.167
- Ugh! Places, everyone!

20:34.267 --> 20:35.900
Ear plugs.

20:41.533 --> 20:43.233
I just gave the performance
of a lifetime.

20:43.333 --> 20:45.633
- It's okay, I'm good.
Seriously.

20:45.733 --> 20:47.800
You tried helping me,
so I'm helping you

20:47.900 --> 20:50.167
keep something
important to you.

20:50.267 --> 20:52.133
Entourage!

20:52.233 --> 20:53.400
- You're going to
steal the show!

20:53.500 --> 20:55.967
It's extra foamy.

20:56.067 --> 20:58.400
- I know.

20:58.500 --> 21:01.133
- It's show time.

21:06.200 --> 21:09.600
- So this is Kentucky!

21:14.933 --> 21:18.533
- *

21:18.633 --> 21:23.433
- Farewell Kentucky!
You'll always be in my dreams.

21:23.533 --> 21:25.867
The light dims. She exits.

21:34.867 --> 21:37.200
- I like it when they
explain what's happening.

21:43.700 --> 21:45.767
- The kiss is next.
Are you okay?

21:45.867 --> 21:48.667
- I'm Max Thunderman.
I can handle this.

21:48.767 --> 21:52.467
- Will you make me the happiest
non

21:52.567 --> 21:55.067
- Yes, Seth from
Kentucky, yes!

21:55.100 --> 21:59.067
- I lied, I can't watch.
- Don't worry, I got you.

21:59.133 --> 22:01.467
- Thanks.

22:01.567 --> 22:04.400
- Wow, it really
is a long kiss.

22:04.500 --> 22:06.567
- Ohhh...

22:11.267 --> 22:26.700
- *
