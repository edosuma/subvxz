I feel pretty good about this,
I did some shopping today.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.356
I think you're gonna like it.

- Thank you, Uncle Paul.
- That's not necessary.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.421
You probably will like it
when you're a little older.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.324

Cooking's one
of my favorite things.

20:19.319 --> 20:20.487
Although, I will say that

20:20.587 --> 20:24.491
you have some
pretty dull...cutlery

20:24.591 --> 20:28.395
and my mom used to say that

only dull people
use dull knives.

No biggie, I think your taste

tonight.

from telling him

Fuck you.

21:10.903 --> 21:13.272
You're not gonna tell anyone,
because if you do

21:13.373 --> 21:15.274
you know that we'll be
moved out of this shithole

and you'll end up
in a foster home with somebody

scares the shit out of you.

the things they're saying?

21:22.081 --> 21:24.150
Of course, he fucking did.
And he wasn't your dad.
