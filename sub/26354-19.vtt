00:21.370 --> 00:23.870
I think Dad's still in a bad mood.

00:23.920 --> 00:26.171
What tipped you off? The
way his mustache is twitching?

00:26.195 --> 00:28.710
It looks like a weird little
dog having a nightmare.

00:28.750 --> 00:30.733
All right, we're going bowling.

00:30.758 --> 00:32.695
Having fun tonight. Right, Bob?

00:32.720 --> 00:34.558
- Mm-hmm.
- Forgetting our troubles.

00:34.588 --> 00:37.023
Not thinking about that dumb magazine

00:37.048 --> 00:38.967
and the list we didn't get on.

00:38.992 --> 00:40.976
And she mentioned the list.

00:41.001 --> 00:43.389
"Best Burgers on the
Shore"? What a joke.

00:43.414 --> 00:45.808
-Bob, it's just a list. Who cares?
-I do!

00:45.848 --> 00:48.358
-But you always say lists are stupid.
-They are.

00:48.383 --> 00:50.373
Even grocery lists? They
remind us to buy pudding.

00:50.398 --> 00:53.273
Dad, if the list is stupid,
why do you want to be on it?

00:53.298 --> 00:55.709
Because it would be
good for business, Tina.

00:55.734 --> 00:57.608
- Oh, yeah, you're a business.
- But, of course,

00:57.658 --> 01:00.318
every restaurant they picked
is some new, trendy place.

01:00.343 --> 01:03.368
And they all serve dumb,
trendy sweet potato fries.

01:03.408 --> 01:06.118
- Here we go.
- Yeah, Tina, here we do go.

01:06.168 --> 01:08.100
Sweet potato fries are too sweet,

01:08.125 --> 01:10.498
and they're stupid, and I hate them.

01:10.523 --> 01:12.787
Mom and her hot son
like sweet potato fries.

01:12.812 --> 01:13.867
I-I like them, too.

01:13.892 --> 01:16.045
Have you tried regular fries, anyone?

01:16.070 --> 01:18.548
Because they're delicious,
and they have the perfect combination

01:18.573 --> 01:20.783
and-and-and... Bob.

01:20.808 --> 01:23.273
- Bob, calm down.
- No, Dad, keep going.

01:23.304 --> 01:25.363
- This is good stuff.
- We know how you feel.

01:25.388 --> 01:27.348
But just for the record,
you asked me to order

01:27.398 --> 01:29.738
-50 pounds of sweet potatoes, right?
-Yes.

01:29.768 --> 01:32.268
And we're gonna add sweet
potato fries to the menu, right?

01:32.318 --> 01:35.148
Yes, because apparently, we
have to make these trendy fries

01:35.173 --> 01:37.173
so the list people will like us.

01:37.198 --> 01:39.693
Okay. Hey, look we're here.

01:39.718 --> 01:41.631
Bobby, you like bowling, right?

01:41.656 --> 01:43.843
Or is that me? Crap, it's me.

01:43.868 --> 01:47.828
Ugh, do all of the shoes have a
used Kleenex in them? Just mine?

01:47.868 --> 01:49.918
- Brag.
- All right,

01:49.958 --> 01:51.838
this is your favorite
lane announcer here

01:51.878 --> 01:53.288
to let the Belcher family know

01:53.313 --> 01:55.523
they're cleared for
takeoff on lane three.

01:55.563 --> 01:57.853
Wait a second. I-I
recognize that voice.

01:57.878 --> 02:00.178
- Gary Busey?
- Watch your toes when you bowl.

02:00.218 --> 02:02.578
Now here's some nasty rock and roll.

02:02.968 --> 02:04.154
Oh, my God. That's Clem Clements.

02:04.178 --> 02:05.848
Clem whoozit?

02:05.888 --> 02:09.381
Clem Clements was the late
night disc jockey on WIXU.

02:09.406 --> 02:11.898
I-I used to listen to him when
I'd work late in the restaurant,

02:11.938 --> 02:13.318
back when we first opened

02:13.343 --> 02:15.453
and things were a little touch and go.

02:15.493 --> 02:18.333
- How far we've come.
- Clem had this slogan...

02:18.358 --> 02:20.004
This is Clem Clements coming at you

02:20.028 --> 02:22.408
with no plan and no BS.

02:22.448 --> 02:25.328
He talked a lot. He
played, like, whole album sides.

02:25.368 --> 02:27.028
He did the show his way,

02:27.053 --> 02:29.093
which was inspiring.

02:29.118 --> 02:31.208
Huh. So what's he doing
working at a bowling alley?

02:31.233 --> 02:33.209
- Maybe we should ask him.
- I'm gonna do it.

02:33.234 --> 02:36.168
- How-how do I look? - Like a sad
man with one bowling shoe on.

02:36.208 --> 02:38.838
And did you do something
new with your butt?

02:39.601 --> 02:41.233
Excuse me, Mr. Clements?

02:41.258 --> 02:44.178
Uh, my name's Bob. I-I'm a big fan.

02:44.203 --> 02:45.743
I never thought I'd see you here.

02:45.768 --> 02:46.978
I never thought I'd be here.

02:47.018 --> 02:49.018
Spraying bowling shoes, for God's sake.

02:49.073 --> 02:51.033
But you spray them
more than that, right?

02:51.058 --> 02:52.943
- Just wondering.
- So what happened?

02:52.968 --> 02:54.728
Why aren't you on the radio anymore?

02:54.768 --> 02:56.398
Eh, the industry went to crap.

02:56.438 --> 02:58.398
First, they wanted me
to play songs that were

02:58.438 --> 03:01.028
- "radio friendly."
- On the radio?

03:01.068 --> 03:02.797
Yep. I refused.

03:02.822 --> 03:05.118
Then they wanted me to
give out prizes on the air.

03:05.183 --> 03:06.763
I refused that, too.

03:06.788 --> 03:08.698
But prizes are kind of fun.

03:08.748 --> 03:10.958
Yeah. I never do anything
unless there's a prize.

03:10.998 --> 03:12.958
Kids, the kind of
listeners that can be bought

03:12.983 --> 03:14.603
with a T-shirt and bumper stickers

03:14.628 --> 03:15.998
are the kind you don't want.

03:16.063 --> 03:17.773
Oh... Stickers.

03:17.798 --> 03:21.088
Anyway, they fired me and
switched to a no-DJ format.

03:21.128 --> 03:23.928
- No DJ?
- Yeah, a computer-generated play-list

03:23.968 --> 03:25.848
and prerecorded station I.D.'s.

03:25.903 --> 03:27.943
- They call it the 'Tude.
- Ugh.

03:27.968 --> 03:31.772
After that, I got a job offer at
a dinky little 40-watt station.

03:31.797 --> 03:34.768
WOFD. But I've got my pride, so...

03:34.808 --> 03:36.768
- So here you are.
- Here I am.

03:36.818 --> 03:38.218
Look at us, being here.

03:38.243 --> 03:40.043
Well, thanks for assigning a lane to us.

03:40.068 --> 03:43.170
- Which lane was it again?
- You're on lane three.

03:43.195 --> 03:45.593
Oh. Uh, I know on the radio
you didn't take requests,

03:45.618 --> 03:48.264
-but could we request lane one? It's...
-No.

03:48.289 --> 03:50.513
That's fine. We'll take any lane.

03:50.538 --> 03:52.554
You're listening to the 'Tude.

03:52.578 --> 03:55.272
Don't like it? Crack open
a can of "we don't care."

03:55.297 --> 03:57.313
Ugh, they fired Clem for this?

03:57.338 --> 04:00.373
I thought they were switching
to no DJs. Isn't that a DJ?

04:00.398 --> 04:02.983
Yeah. He's a made-up
character called Eddie 'Tude.

04:03.008 --> 04:04.218
He has quite the attitude.

04:04.507 --> 04:06.113
Oh, I just got the name.

04:06.138 --> 04:08.428
He's obnoxious, and the music is awful.

04:08.468 --> 04:10.137
But besides that, it's pretty good.

04:10.138 --> 04:11.768
So what can I get you?

04:11.808 --> 04:14.228
I'll take a Burger of the Day and, uh,

04:14.268 --> 04:15.978
some of those new sweet potato fries.

04:16.017 --> 04:17.017
- Mm.
- Bob...

04:17.058 --> 04:18.661
You like regular fries, right?

04:18.687 --> 04:19.767
Get the regular fries.

04:19.817 --> 04:20.778
My doctor said sweet potato fries

04:20.817 --> 04:22.278
are better for you, actually.

04:22.318 --> 04:23.834
Since when do you listen to your doctor?

04:23.858 --> 04:25.451
-What?
-Yogurt's better for you, too, Teddy.

04:25.476 --> 04:27.593
Do you want yogurt fries?

04:27.618 --> 04:30.412
No. I-I like sweet potato
fries. What are yogurt fries?

04:30.437 --> 04:32.078
Don't try to serve me yogurt fries.

04:32.118 --> 04:33.938
Sorry, I can't do this, Lin.

04:33.963 --> 04:35.803
Sweet potato fries are
officially off the menu.

04:35.828 --> 04:38.918
Okay, okay. Take it
easy. It's just fries.

04:38.958 --> 04:41.144
You know what? I-I'm
gonna call the bowling alley.

04:41.168 --> 04:43.258
I-I want to bring Clem some lunch.

04:43.298 --> 04:45.412
The universe sent him
to that bowling alley,

04:45.437 --> 04:47.209
and then it sent me
to that bowling alley

04:47.234 --> 04:51.098
so he could remind me to
stick to my guns about fries.

04:51.138 --> 04:53.678
Uh, permission to go with Dad
to see how his freak-out goes?

04:53.728 --> 04:55.717
All of you, go. Keep your dad calm.

04:55.742 --> 04:57.098
Say things like, "Dad, chill out,"

04:57.148 --> 04:58.648
and, "Tone it down, old man."

04:58.703 --> 05:00.623
How about "It's all gravy, baby"?

05:00.648 --> 05:03.756
I'll bring him a burger
and some regular fries.

05:03.781 --> 05:04.911
Yeah, you do that.

05:05.312 --> 05:06.459
You think I could still get

05:06.499 --> 05:08.209
some of those sweet potato fries, Lin?

05:08.259 --> 05:10.351
Wait till the scary man leaves.

05:11.759 --> 05:13.799
Mm. Mm. Thanks, Bob.

05:13.839 --> 05:15.799
You know, the station
manager used to yell at me

05:15.849 --> 05:17.559
for doing the show with my mouth full.

05:17.599 --> 05:20.600
Yeah, but you did it anyway.
It was cool and-and gross.

05:20.625 --> 05:22.875
- Like neti pots.
- He's also the guy

05:22.925 --> 05:25.505
who fired me and told me
nobody wants to listen to a DJ

05:25.545 --> 05:27.867
who talks too much and
plays whatever he wants.

05:27.892 --> 05:30.586
Well, I want to listen.
And I can't be the only one.

05:30.611 --> 05:32.731
I mean, my kids want
to listen. Right, kids?

05:32.756 --> 05:35.273
I do. I like this guy's style.

05:35.298 --> 05:37.320
I hope I've burned half as
many bridges when I'm his age.

05:37.345 --> 05:38.595
I want to listen, too.

05:38.620 --> 05:39.984
What's radio again?

05:40.009 --> 05:41.839
Tell this stuff to my station manager.

05:41.968 --> 05:44.508
You know what? I will.
I-I'll call the station.

05:44.556 --> 05:46.096
Eh, I don't think you can even reach

05:46.121 --> 05:47.911
a real live person anymore.

05:47.936 --> 05:49.906
Then I'll go there. I'll go right now.

05:49.931 --> 05:51.781
Station manager's not there today.

05:51.806 --> 05:55.260
Okay, tomorrow, then? I
mean, I'm pretty fired up now,

05:55.285 --> 05:58.205
but I could get fired up
again tomorrow, probably.

05:58.245 --> 06:00.375
- Sure you could, Dad.
- Ask your doctor if it's safe

06:00.415 --> 06:02.437
for you to get fired
up two days in a row.

06:02.462 --> 06:04.172
Know what? I'll go with you tomorrow.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.289
Uh, r-really? Uh, great.

06:06.314 --> 06:08.154
I want to see the look on Vance's face

06:08.179 --> 06:09.809
when he meets a real live fan.

06:09.834 --> 06:11.179
It'll be like this.

06:11.204 --> 06:14.922
"Turn off that fan!
It's too windy in here!"

06:18.477 --> 06:20.203
So you're just showing
up at the radio station?

06:20.227 --> 06:22.267
-Is that the plan?
-Well, yeah, we'll march in there

06:22.317 --> 06:24.277
and tell the station
manager he made a mistake

06:24.317 --> 06:26.277
throwing away something pure and raw

06:26.317 --> 06:28.697
for something trendy and not raw.

06:28.737 --> 06:30.237
And we'll get Clem his job back.

06:30.277 --> 06:32.277
Probably not. But we can hope.

06:32.327 --> 06:33.963
- Come on, kids.
- Well, while you do that,

06:33.987 --> 06:35.747
I'm gonna be back here pushing pie.

06:35.787 --> 06:37.907
"We sell pie now?" I ask hopefully.

06:37.957 --> 06:40.143
Yeah, we got to do something
with all these sweet potatoes.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.537
So many frickin' sweet potatoes, Bob.

06:42.587 --> 06:44.547
I'm sorry. But I'm glad they're pies.

06:44.587 --> 06:46.047
Sweet potatoes like to be pies.

06:46.087 --> 06:48.157
They were born to be dessert.

06:48.182 --> 06:49.942
All right, we get it. Go.

06:49.967 --> 06:53.257
Tell the pies I'll be back.
Wait for me. Wait for me!

06:54.430 --> 06:55.508
Clem, hi.

06:55.540 --> 06:58.124
Hey. Thanks for this, Bob. You're cool.

06:58.141 --> 07:00.578
Oh, my God, Clem Clements
just called me cool.

07:00.603 --> 07:02.353
- You heard "cool"?
- I heard "stool."

07:02.378 --> 07:04.883
That's a weird ice cream
truck. No judgment.

07:04.908 --> 07:06.618
Ugh. The 'Tude Cruiser.

07:06.643 --> 07:08.233
It used to be for live broadcasts.

07:08.258 --> 07:10.666
Now it's for giving
away T-shirts at malls.

07:10.691 --> 07:13.151
Ooh. I mean, grr, T-shirts at malls.

07:13.176 --> 07:15.992
You know, we could just light
it on fire and call it a day.

07:16.017 --> 07:16.947
Dad, hear him out.

07:16.972 --> 07:19.890
Uh, maybe we should just
stick to the other plan.

07:19.915 --> 07:22.062
Nuh-uh. No plan, no BS.

07:22.087 --> 07:24.467
Right. I mean, our non-plan plan.

07:24.492 --> 07:26.547
Let's, uh, just go inside?

07:28.020 --> 07:30.856
Hey, Mort. You want a
slice of sweet potato pie?

07:30.881 --> 07:32.801
Ah, I don't know.
What do you say, Teddy?

07:32.826 --> 07:35.125
- Is it worth the calories?
- It sure looks good.

07:35.150 --> 07:38.531
Mm.

07:38.556 --> 07:40.196
- Huh.
- Teddy?

07:40.221 --> 07:42.406
I'm sorry, Linda. The pie is terrible.

07:42.431 --> 07:43.945
What do you mean, "terrible"?

07:43.970 --> 07:45.380
I think it needs more sugar.

07:45.405 --> 07:47.051
Sugar? I didn't add any sugar.

07:47.076 --> 07:49.376
Sweet potatoes are already
sweet. It's in the name.

07:49.401 --> 07:50.099
Huh.

07:50.124 --> 07:52.191
And I was out of cinnamon
and a couple other things.

07:52.223 --> 07:54.670
I improvised. Like jazz, but it's a pie.

07:54.695 --> 07:55.547
Let me try.

07:56.797 --> 07:58.616
I think it's...

07:58.781 --> 08:00.281
It's not totally...

08:00.331 --> 08:01.951
I'm sorry, it's awful.

08:02.001 --> 08:03.631
So, big deal. You messed up one pie.

08:03.661 --> 08:05.411
Ten. I messed up ten pies.

08:05.461 --> 08:08.539
Oof. You messed up ten pies?

08:08.564 --> 08:11.904
Hey, on the bright side, maybe
that's a record of some sort?

08:11.929 --> 08:13.316
It's got to be, right? Look it up, Mort.

08:13.341 --> 08:14.721
Pretending to look it up,

08:14.761 --> 08:16.881
wishing I hadn't come in here today.

08:16.931 --> 08:19.091
So, let me get this straight, Clem.

08:19.116 --> 08:21.736
You're rolling into the
'Tude with four randos,

08:21.761 --> 08:24.246
three of whom I definitely
suspect are children,

08:24.271 --> 08:26.000
to tell me that I'm wrong?

08:26.025 --> 08:27.985
- That's right.
- And to take his job back.

08:28.010 --> 08:32.014
Uh, yeah. Uh, we're-we're
fans, and, um, we-we like Clem.

08:32.039 --> 08:33.731
- Powerful.
- And you are... ?

08:33.780 --> 08:34.936
Bob. I-I'm Bob.

08:34.961 --> 08:36.780
You couldn't have done
this over the phone, Bob?

08:36.821 --> 08:38.750
Well, Clem said no one
answers the phone here.

08:38.775 --> 08:40.320
Uh, we answer the phone.

08:40.345 --> 08:42.635
Yes, but there's a
difficult-to-navigate menu

08:42.660 --> 08:43.991
of automated options.

08:44.041 --> 08:45.871
Going great, Dad. You got this.

08:45.911 --> 08:47.961
- Uh, Vance, I-I know you just met me...
- Yes.

08:48.001 --> 08:50.541
Louise, stop. I know you
just met me, and this is, um,

08:50.591 --> 08:52.391
weird, but please, hear me out.

08:52.421 --> 08:55.091
Little advice... um, usually,
when people say "hear me out... "

08:55.131 --> 08:56.603
... they follow it up with
something coherent.

08:56.628 --> 08:57.226
Ow.

08:57.251 --> 08:58.279
- Yeah, fi...
- So, got to go now.

08:58.304 --> 08:59.891
- Wait, I...
- Yeah, talking about you.

08:59.931 --> 09:02.221
I didn't rehearse what I was gonna say.

09:02.261 --> 09:04.641
I-I didn't know I was
gonna break into song.

09:04.681 --> 09:07.181
- Yeah, that came out of nowhere.
- Huh, look.

09:07.231 --> 09:08.141
That's my old booth.

09:08.191 --> 09:09.981
Wow. There it is.

09:10.006 --> 09:11.389
Underwhelming. But in a great way?

09:11.414 --> 09:13.256
Oh. Are-are we allowed to... ?

09:13.281 --> 09:16.121
Eh, who cares? They
don't use it anymore.

09:16.531 --> 09:18.281
Wow, it's just like I imagined it.

09:18.321 --> 09:22.136
There's a microphone
and a-a board with knobs.

09:22.161 --> 09:24.117
- Good imagination, Dad.
- Hi, Clem.

09:24.871 --> 09:27.057
I-I thought you said they don't
use the booth anymore, Clem.

09:27.081 --> 09:28.331
They don't use the booth.

09:28.371 --> 09:30.711
They use the engineer. That's Patrick.

09:30.751 --> 09:33.671
He was the engineer for my show,
and he could've left with me,

09:33.711 --> 09:36.453
but he stuck around because
he likes "working for money."

09:36.478 --> 09:38.928
Mm. That voice. It really
lights up the equalizers.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.656
Nice to hear you again.

09:40.681 --> 09:43.431
What's it like running the
board for a fake DJ, Patrick?

09:43.456 --> 09:45.431
Eddie 'Tude may be fake,
but he's the number one

09:45.471 --> 09:47.101
drive-time DJ in the market.

09:47.141 --> 09:48.695
Successful but imaginary.

09:48.720 --> 09:51.136
- Like Gene's friend Ken.
- True. Hey!

09:51.191 --> 09:53.111
I'll bet you miss being
in that chair, huh?

09:53.151 --> 09:54.861
Yep. Lot of memories.

09:54.901 --> 09:56.797
Lot of blood, sweat
and farts in that chair.

09:56.822 --> 09:59.928
I'm getting mostly farts.
Oh, wait, there's the sweat.

09:59.953 --> 10:01.201
You must miss this.

10:01.241 --> 10:03.347
Do you want a picture of
yourself sitting in the chair,

10:03.386 --> 10:05.568
- or-or is that dumb?
- Huh.

10:05.593 --> 10:07.676
Hey, do... do you think
I could sit in the chair?

10:07.701 --> 10:09.371
Uh, yeah, yeah, sure.
Knock yourself out.

10:09.411 --> 10:11.795
Really? Great. Louise, get
a picture of me leaning in

10:11.820 --> 10:14.733
and holding the microphone like
I'm about to say something cool.

10:14.758 --> 10:17.678
I am so embarrassed
for that microphone right now.

10:18.968 --> 10:21.133
Um... Clem?

10:21.158 --> 10:24.098
-What-what are you doing? -Just
moving this couch over here.

10:24.138 --> 10:26.017
Seeing how it looks blocking the door.

10:26.018 --> 10:27.348
Can I have that mic for a second?

10:27.398 --> 10:28.601
Oh, my God. You're-you're not...

10:28.626 --> 10:30.015
Sorry for this interruption

10:30.040 --> 10:32.318
to your regularly scheduled fraud-cast.

10:32.358 --> 10:35.726
This is Clem Clements, coming
at you with no plan and no BS.

10:35.751 --> 10:37.226
Patrick, don't you hit that button.

10:37.251 --> 10:40.238
Folks, open up your ears for some weird.

10:40.288 --> 10:43.298
- You with me, Bob?
- Wha-what is happening?

10:43.328 --> 10:44.804
Patrick, open the door.
Open the door right now.

10:44.828 --> 10:46.368
Patrick, don't. Look at me, Patrick.

10:46.418 --> 10:47.998
- Patrick, look at me.
- Say my name.

10:48.038 --> 10:50.588
- Patrick, say my name.
- Oh, my God,

10:50.628 --> 10:51.958
oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

10:51.983 --> 10:52.959
Yes!

10:52.984 --> 10:54.704
- We are live, people!
- No. No, no, no, no.

10:57.693 --> 10:59.929
Open the door. I am
so serious right now.

10:59.954 --> 11:02.073
Clem, he sounds so serious.

11:02.098 --> 11:03.515
I-I should open the door.

11:03.540 --> 11:05.364
Hey, listeners, that
quavery voice you're hearing

11:05.388 --> 11:06.836
is my friend Bob.

11:06.861 --> 11:08.938
He's kind of the reason
I'm talking to you today.

11:08.963 --> 11:10.539
No, no, no. I... Hi.

11:10.564 --> 11:12.101
You got your offspring here, right, Bob?

11:12.126 --> 11:14.211
- Tell everyone your names, kids.
- Clem, listen.

11:14.236 --> 11:16.498
I'm Gene, the boy with the golden voice.

11:16.528 --> 11:17.890
- And golden ding-dong.
- Gene!

11:17.915 --> 11:19.820
- And you?
- I don't think we should be doing this,

11:19.845 --> 11:21.754
but I always wanted to
talk on the radio, so...

11:21.778 --> 11:23.172
'Sup? I'm Tina.

11:23.197 --> 11:26.288
And I am a pillar of
fire with hammer hands.

11:26.328 --> 11:28.297
You can't see me. You
can't tell me I'm not.

11:28.322 --> 11:29.982
Okay, I-I'm opening the door.

11:30.007 --> 11:32.265
Before you do that,
Bob, can I have a word?

11:32.290 --> 11:34.170
Patrick, dig up one of our old tracks.

11:34.195 --> 11:35.195
Oh, oh, give us the mic.

11:35.220 --> 11:36.680
Five minutes of fart sounds?

11:36.705 --> 11:38.984
Sure. Go nuts.

11:39.054 --> 11:41.264
Don't open the door.
This is what we wanted.

11:41.289 --> 11:42.669
I got my job back.

11:42.694 --> 11:44.323
This isn't getting your job back.

11:44.348 --> 11:46.148
This is you barricading
yourself in this room.

11:46.178 --> 11:47.228
They're very different.

11:47.268 --> 11:48.388
I thought we were a team.

11:48.438 --> 11:50.308
But hey, you do what you got to do.

11:50.333 --> 11:52.213
Me, I'm gonna plug my
iPod into that console

11:52.238 --> 11:53.562
and put it on shuffle.

11:53.587 --> 11:55.837
And if some of my
spoken-word poetry plays,

11:55.862 --> 11:58.079
some of my spoken-word poetry plays.

12:00.539 --> 12:02.781
So, the animal shelter
won't take the pies.

12:02.806 --> 12:05.234
Figures. Probably a
bunch of snobby poodles.

12:05.259 --> 12:07.469
Oh, what are we gonna
do with these things?

12:07.494 --> 12:10.284
I don't know. Mm. I
mean, they're really...

12:10.309 --> 12:11.773
they're not good pies.

12:11.798 --> 12:13.548
Here, let me try this one.

12:13.798 --> 12:15.758
- Oh, awful! Gross.
- Mm. Ugh.

12:15.783 --> 12:16.929
Pass the whipped cream, please.

12:16.954 --> 12:19.640
- Hold on. Mm. Mm.
- Oh. Mm.

12:19.665 --> 12:22.875
Little more.

12:24.566 --> 12:27.526
-Hey, check it out. Bob's on the radio.
-What?

12:27.551 --> 12:30.801
That sound you hear
is not the world's longest drum solo.

12:30.826 --> 12:33.666
It's a security guard
pounding on the studio door.

12:33.691 --> 12:35.293
Yeah, and he's mad.

12:35.318 --> 12:37.586
- W-We could get arrested.
- What? Bob.

12:37.611 --> 12:40.490
Question... Now can you play
the world's longest drum solo?

12:40.515 --> 12:41.448
Cuing it up.

12:41.488 --> 12:43.254
Oh, my God! My babies!

12:43.278 --> 12:46.258
No one said anything
about my new haircut... !

12:47.273 --> 12:49.618
Before we blast these tunes to the moon,

12:49.658 --> 12:51.000
this might be a good time to check in

12:51.025 --> 12:52.803
with my old friend-gineer Patrick.

12:52.843 --> 12:54.343
Used to be just us humans,

12:54.368 --> 12:56.448
before the robot radio revolution.

12:56.473 --> 12:58.483
How are the robots
treating you, Patrick?

12:58.548 --> 13:00.588
Mm, fair. Not many people work here now.

13:00.643 --> 13:03.153
The company Christmas
party is just me and Vance.

13:03.178 --> 13:05.298
It takes all the fun
out of Secret Santa.

13:05.323 --> 13:07.469
Excuse me, Clem, where's your
slide whistle sound effect,

13:07.494 --> 13:09.414
in case a zinger comes to me later?

13:09.439 --> 13:11.699
I would also like to
request a record scratch

13:11.724 --> 13:13.264
followed by a laser sound.

13:13.289 --> 13:15.169
Normally, I'm not a sound effects guy,

13:15.194 --> 13:16.404
but I'll do it this once.

13:21.528 --> 13:23.453
Crying baby into sad trombone?

13:23.478 --> 13:24.843
Are you Mozart?

13:24.908 --> 13:26.488
Hello?

13:26.528 --> 13:28.584
Patrick, it's Vance.
Shut them down right now.

13:28.609 --> 13:29.658
Don't you have a button for that?

13:29.683 --> 13:31.983
- I do have a button.
- Then push it.

13:32.008 --> 13:35.138
Yeah, but if I push the button,
they're gonna come in here

13:35.163 --> 13:36.413
and also push the button,

13:36.438 --> 13:38.028
which would undo my button pushing,

13:38.053 --> 13:39.933
and we're just back to where we started.

13:39.958 --> 13:41.434
Damn it, Patrick, you're
getting too technical.

13:41.459 --> 13:42.959
We are in deep doo-doo here.

13:42.984 --> 13:44.824
It is code red over at corporate.

13:44.849 --> 13:46.979
- Code red? Uh-oh.
- Yeah. Now, I'd call the cops myself,

13:47.004 --> 13:48.990
but corporate said I got
to handle this quietly.

13:49.015 --> 13:50.453
And I don't know how
to handle this at all.

13:50.478 --> 13:52.238
You're doing great.

13:52.263 --> 13:54.263
Who is that? Patrick,
tell me I'm not on the air.

13:54.288 --> 13:56.553
- My fault. You're on the air.
- Damn it!

13:56.578 --> 13:59.308
But now we're not on the air,
so you can say anything you want.

13:59.333 --> 14:01.413
Okay, good. Clem, I don't
know how to handle this,

14:01.438 --> 14:03.068
and I feel like I'm gonna cry.

14:03.093 --> 14:05.343
Oh, I'm so sorry, we were on the air.

14:05.368 --> 14:06.858
No! They tricked me!

14:06.883 --> 14:09.093
Bob's got his phone off. Oh, God.

14:09.118 --> 14:11.198
Teddy, you brought one of the pies?

14:11.223 --> 14:13.484
I thought maybe it would
taste better in the truck.

14:13.788 --> 14:16.168
Oh, where's the station?

14:16.208 --> 14:17.724
Could you, uh, pass
the... there's a fork

14:17.748 --> 14:19.274
in the glove compartment,
glove compartment fork.

14:19.298 --> 14:21.098
Clem, I think we can

14:21.128 --> 14:23.088
- sign off now, right?
- There's Bob!

14:23.128 --> 14:25.468
Bob, Bob, get out of
there! It's me, Linda!

14:25.508 --> 14:28.548
Listen to your wife. We
both love you very much.

14:28.598 --> 14:30.218
Teddy, go, go faster.

14:30.258 --> 14:32.178
Where are you going with this, Clem?

14:32.203 --> 14:34.219
You're-you're not getting
hired back at this station

14:34.244 --> 14:35.781
after you hijacked it.

14:35.806 --> 14:38.046
- "Hijacked" is a strong word.
- Soft-jacked?

14:38.071 --> 14:39.437
- Soft-jacked.
- Guys.

14:39.462 --> 14:42.156
Where I'm going with this
is let's have some more fun

14:42.181 --> 14:43.633
before they break the door down.

14:43.688 --> 14:45.568
So sit back, we're
gonna be here a while,

14:45.608 --> 14:47.778
'cause that's a really serious
door, which, by the way,

14:47.803 --> 14:50.063
was gonna be the name of
The Doors, but it sounded

14:50.088 --> 14:52.133
- too serious.
- First off, love it.

14:52.158 --> 14:54.908
One question... bathroom. Where
should I go in this room?

14:54.958 --> 14:57.828
- Oh. Maybe hold it?
- So, that corner?

14:57.878 --> 14:59.888
- Louise, no.
- You got three other options.

14:59.918 --> 15:03.258
Whatever we're doing, let's make
a decision. Storm's a-coming.

15:03.298 --> 15:06.128
The little girl goes out,
you stay in the hallway.

15:06.153 --> 15:08.039
- Do we have a deal?
- Absolutely.

15:08.064 --> 15:11.758
- Fellas, got to move this along.
- Okay, I'm opening the door now.

15:11.783 --> 15:13.009
Great. Do it.

15:13.058 --> 15:14.348
Oh, boy.

15:14.388 --> 15:16.279
I thought we had a deal.

15:16.304 --> 15:17.348
We do have a deal.

15:17.373 --> 15:19.633
- You're trying to get in.
- No, I'm not.

15:19.658 --> 15:21.408
It really seems like you are.

15:21.478 --> 15:24.108
I don't know, maybe he just
likes the way that feels.

15:24.133 --> 15:26.078
Yes, exactly. He's right.

15:26.103 --> 15:28.958
- Aha! I was trying to get in.
- I knew it.

15:29.028 --> 15:31.068
- Damn it.
- I'm so sorry, I'm really sorry,

15:31.093 --> 15:32.883
- and I got to go.
- That's it, Clem.

15:32.908 --> 15:36.078
Your little stunt is over, and
let me tell you something else...

15:36.103 --> 15:38.278
The 'Tude is a hit, and
you're just a moldy oldie

15:38.303 --> 15:40.143
who does things weird.

15:40.168 --> 15:41.668
-Geez.
-Ouch. -Yikes.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.967
I'll see you at the
bowling alley, tomorrow,

15:43.992 --> 15:45.814
for my son's birthday party.
You know we're coming, right?

15:45.838 --> 15:47.008
I-I think we confirmed?

15:47.048 --> 15:48.314
I haven't found the bathroom,

15:48.338 --> 15:50.088
but I found a bunch of paper cups.

15:50.138 --> 15:52.848
Ah... Not a good aim. We should go.

15:52.888 --> 15:55.178
Clem, he-he didn't mean what he said.

15:55.218 --> 15:57.808
I mean, he did. I don't
know why I started that way.

15:57.848 --> 16:01.478
He's right, though. I guess
I'll, uh... I'll see you around.

16:01.503 --> 16:04.083
Kids, I forgot your names, but bye.

16:04.108 --> 16:05.968
- Bye, radio man.
- Clem, wait!

16:05.993 --> 16:08.043
- Th-Th-The 'Tude
Cruiser. - Yeah?

16:08.068 --> 16:10.158
-You said you can broadcast from there.
-Yeah?

16:10.198 --> 16:12.988
Well, what if we borrowed
it? Wh-Where are the keys?

16:13.013 --> 16:14.643
- I have keys.
- Patrick?

16:14.668 --> 16:16.508
You quit in support of Clem?

16:16.533 --> 16:18.993
You could say that,
but really, I got fired.

16:19.018 --> 16:20.223
Oh, sorry, buddy.

16:20.248 --> 16:22.687
I was gonna quit anyway, in ten years.

16:22.712 --> 16:25.378
I like your idea, Bob.
Want to go for a ride?

16:25.433 --> 16:26.933
Ready to roll, everybody?

16:26.958 --> 16:28.378
- Yes, yes, yes!
- Yeah!

16:28.418 --> 16:30.878
Let's do this. Oh, wait,
that's my neighbor's key.

16:30.928 --> 16:32.298
I'm looking after her cat.

16:32.348 --> 16:34.500
- Aw.
- Let's do this.

16:37.007 --> 16:39.023
- So, what are we doing?
- First, we get back

16:39.048 --> 16:40.921
on the air, which means
we have to park somewhere

16:40.946 --> 16:42.859
- and set up, right, Patrick?
- Exactly.

16:42.884 --> 16:45.178
- Then what?
- Uh, then we open the phones

16:45.203 --> 16:46.518
and talk to the people.

16:46.543 --> 16:48.187
I bet you got through
to a lot of them today.

16:48.211 --> 16:50.420
-And they're gonna want Clem back?
-Uh, yeah.

16:50.445 --> 16:53.170
Uh, you know there are no phones
in the 'Tude Cruiser, right?

16:53.195 --> 16:54.320
Crap, really?

16:54.345 --> 16:56.764
But you could hold a
cell phone up to the mic.

16:56.789 --> 16:59.209
So, give out my phone
number over the radio?

16:59.234 --> 17:02.050
Worried about stalkers?
It's okay, you'll get one.

17:02.075 --> 17:03.641
Where are we gonna
park the 'Tude Cruiser?

17:03.665 --> 17:05.221
How about at that restaurant over there?

17:05.244 --> 17:06.585
And I'm not just saying that

17:06.625 --> 17:08.132
because we missed lunch. Okay, I am.

17:08.156 --> 17:11.164
Oh, my God. That place is on the list.

17:11.189 --> 17:13.000
"Best Burgers on the Shore."

17:13.032 --> 17:14.359
You carry that around?

17:14.385 --> 17:15.845
Yeah, it's his super cool way

17:15.885 --> 17:17.319
of showing how little he cares about it.

17:17.345 --> 17:18.941
Patrick, this thing we're about to do,

17:18.964 --> 17:20.675
- will it be loud?
- Yes.

17:20.700 --> 17:23.539
Loud enough to annoy trendy
people trying to eat lunch?

17:23.564 --> 17:26.992
- Probably.
- Then we park there.

17:28.790 --> 17:30.330
I don't get it.

17:30.355 --> 17:31.711
They said Bob and the kids left already,

17:31.735 --> 17:32.921
but the car's still here.

17:32.938 --> 17:34.858
Whoa, there's signs
of a struggle in there.

17:34.883 --> 17:36.250
Nah, that's how it always looks.

17:36.275 --> 17:38.211
Come on, back in the truck.
Is there any pie left?

17:38.236 --> 17:39.992
A little bit that I was
gonna save for later,

17:40.017 --> 17:42.227
but, uh, yeah, I mean, I
guess you can have some.

17:43.394 --> 17:45.524
I see a lot of sweet potato fries.

17:45.549 --> 17:47.257
Don't believe the hype, people!

17:47.282 --> 17:49.112
Save it for the airwaves, big guy.

17:49.137 --> 17:51.297
So I used the restaurant
Wi-Fi to access

17:51.322 --> 17:53.984
the 'Tude transmitter site
and hack the audio encoder.

17:54.009 --> 17:56.089
How'd you do that? I'm hack-curious.

17:56.114 --> 17:59.632
Maybe "hack" is a strong word.
They never set up a password.

17:59.657 --> 18:02.577
- I just logged on.
- And we're back, folks.

18:02.602 --> 18:04.522
Sorry for that rude interruption,

18:04.547 --> 18:06.757
or should I say, "'Tude interruption."

18:06.782 --> 18:07.782
Nice!

18:09.208 --> 18:10.878
- They're back on the air.
- Now what?

18:10.903 --> 18:13.073
- Just drive.
- And never look back?

18:13.098 --> 18:15.781
- No, and find Bob.
- We don't even know where he is.

18:15.806 --> 18:18.266
Right, right. Okay, just drive, then.

18:18.291 --> 18:20.097
The phone lines are really lighting up.

18:20.122 --> 18:22.518
I mean, it's just the one line,
but it's vibrating like crazy.

18:22.543 --> 18:24.429
Dad has that thing set to shiatsu.

18:24.454 --> 18:26.632
Put it on my back. Oh, wait,
I just got another idea.

18:26.657 --> 18:27.625
Gene.

18:27.650 --> 18:29.796
First caller who isn't
Vance at the station.

18:29.821 --> 18:31.991
Vance, stop calling.
Stop it. I hate you.

18:32.016 --> 18:33.976
- First caller, you're on.
- Hello.

18:34.001 --> 18:36.041
The reason for this
call is to let you know

18:36.066 --> 18:37.696
you're now eligible for interest rates

18:37.721 --> 18:39.141
as low as six percent.

18:39.166 --> 18:40.256
Whoa, Dad, congrats.

18:40.281 --> 18:42.289
Does this mean one of
us can go to college?

18:42.314 --> 18:44.250
Next caller. You're on the air.

18:44.275 --> 18:46.315
Oh, thank God, I got through!

18:46.340 --> 18:47.968
- Linda?
- Bob.

18:47.993 --> 18:49.503
Linda, turn down your radio.

18:49.528 --> 18:50.608
I just want to say...

18:50.633 --> 18:52.183
Whoa, my voice sounds weird.

18:52.208 --> 18:53.578
Turn down the radio, Linda.

18:53.603 --> 18:55.476
Oh, we got
to turn down the radio.

18:55.501 --> 18:57.039
Linda,
why are you calling?

18:57.064 --> 18:58.937
We're kind of looking for
Clem Clements fans right now.

18:58.962 --> 19:00.722
Bob, where are you?

19:00.747 --> 19:03.997
We're at an undisclosed
location, but we might be near

19:04.022 --> 19:05.208
one of the restaurants on the list.

19:05.233 --> 19:07.718
The list? Oh, Bob, let it go.

19:07.743 --> 19:09.490
Don't worry, Mom. He's
handling it really well.

19:09.539 --> 19:11.078
No, he's not, Mom.

19:11.103 --> 19:12.484
He's shouting at people
eating sweet potato fries.

19:12.509 --> 19:15.719
Only that one guy,
Tina, and that couple.

19:15.744 --> 19:17.704
- I mean, a couple couples.
- Bob, listen.

19:17.729 --> 19:19.945
Trendy stuff is just trendy. So what?

19:19.970 --> 19:21.625
You care about what you do.

19:21.650 --> 19:23.440
And you're stubborn,

19:23.465 --> 19:25.562
and sometimes that means not
everyone's gonna like you,

19:25.587 --> 19:27.156
but the people who like
you really like you.

19:27.181 --> 19:28.601
And that's who you do it for,

19:28.626 --> 19:30.296
not some dumb list.

19:30.663 --> 19:34.500
Thanks, Linda. Uh,
that's nice of you to say.

19:34.525 --> 19:37.735
- Mmm. No sweat, baby.
- Are you... What are you eating?

19:37.760 --> 19:39.720
T-T-T-T-Tude FM.

19:39.745 --> 19:41.984
Cram this in your sound hole.

19:42.009 --> 19:43.639
Crap, the 'Tude is back.

19:43.664 --> 19:45.664
- Patrick, do your thing.
- I can't.

19:45.689 --> 19:47.439
They locked me out, which is fair.

19:47.480 --> 19:49.610
Well, I guess that's it.

19:49.635 --> 19:51.711
Sorry I dragged you into this,

19:51.736 --> 19:53.536
but it sounds like
you're doing all right.

19:53.561 --> 19:56.187
I mean, you've got your loyal
customers and your family.

19:56.212 --> 19:58.922
Yeah, but you've got,
um, well, you know...

19:58.947 --> 20:01.947
Right, I have, uh...

20:01.972 --> 20:03.682
Free bowling shoes?

20:03.707 --> 20:06.087
Do you have a bow and
arrow? That's something.

20:06.112 --> 20:07.414
No.

20:07.439 --> 20:08.336
Dad, your phone keeps buzzing.

20:08.361 --> 20:09.781
Oh. Hello?

20:09.806 --> 20:11.056
Y-Yeah, he's here.

20:11.081 --> 20:12.382
- Is it for Clem?
- Hello?

20:12.407 --> 20:13.747
Hey, Clem Clements?

20:13.772 --> 20:14.958
- Yeah?
- I was listening to you,

20:14.983 --> 20:16.653
but then the 'Tude came back,

20:16.678 --> 20:18.758
but then you came back,
then the 'Tude came back.

20:18.783 --> 20:19.742
Are you gonna come back or what?

20:19.767 --> 20:20.828
I think we're done, buddy.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.734
No, that sucks!

20:22.759 --> 20:25.009
Wait, there's someone
else calling. Hello?

20:25.034 --> 20:26.560
'Tude stinks! Bring back Clem!

20:26.585 --> 20:28.585
Oh, there's another call. Hello?

20:28.610 --> 20:30.950
Hey, Clem, it's Dan over at WOFD.

20:30.975 --> 20:32.718
We talked a while back.

20:32.743 --> 20:34.333
You know, our offer still stands.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.938
- We love what you did today.
- Whoa, hey, Dan.

20:36.963 --> 20:39.753
I got to say, right now
it's nice to be appreciated.

20:39.835 --> 20:41.742
I tell you what, I will work for you

20:41.767 --> 20:43.363
if you hire Patrick as my engineer.

20:43.388 --> 20:45.178
That is great news!

20:45.203 --> 20:47.673
The shift we have right
now is midnight to 8:00 a.m.

20:47.698 --> 20:49.828
-We'll be there.
-Oh, that's when I do my sleeping.

20:49.853 --> 20:52.664
Uh, sorry, caller. Uh, do
you guys hear that?

20:52.704 --> 20:54.994
- Uh-oh. - Time to move.
- What should we do?

20:55.019 --> 20:56.319
Push this sucker off the pier?

20:56.344 --> 20:57.844
- Maybe.
- Maybe not.

20:57.869 --> 20:59.906
- Maybe just return it.
- Oh, boo.
