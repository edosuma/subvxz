00:01.080 --> 00:05.440
(theme music playing)

01:10.720 --> 01:14.000
(Dick Clark) <i>And It stretches way up</i>
<i>and way down the whole square.</i>

01:14.080 --> 01:17.360
<i>They've all got their eyes up on</i>
<i>top of this big building here...</i>

01:17.440 --> 01:21.600
(Angela)<i> What I was thinking,</i>
<i>as like a New Year's resolution,</i>

01:21.680 --> 01:24.640
<i>is to stop getting so caught</i>
<i>up In my own thoughts...</i>

01:25.640 --> 01:29.600
<i>because I'm like way too</i>
<i>introspective, I think.</i>

01:32.440 --> 01:36.840
(Sharon)<i> I resolve to never</i>
<i>again have sex with Kyle,</i>

01:36.920 --> 01:42.120
<i>or anyone, again unless</i>
<i>I really love and respect them.</i>

01:44.320 --> 01:48.800
(Kyle)<i> To spend more time</i>
<i>with the dog, and Sharon.</i>

01:48.880 --> 01:51.920
(TV playing)

01:54.320 --> 02:00.400
(Katimski)<i> To... give up coffee.</i>
<i>There, that's an easy one.</i>

02:03.200 --> 02:08.680
(Brian)<i> I resolve to stop</i>
<i>obsessing over Angela Chase.</i>

02:09.920 --> 02:12.440
(Danielle)<i> To badger Mom</i>
<i>into letting me wear make-up.</i>

02:14.080 --> 02:18.000
(Rickie)<i> To find some place</i>
<i>where I really belong.</i>

02:20.280 --> 02:22.360
(Angela)
<i>But what If not thinking</i>

02:22.440 --> 02:24.880
<i>turns me into this really</i>
<i>shallow person?</i>

02:25.920 --> 02:29.280
<i>I better rethink this becoming</i>
<i>less introspective thing.</i>

02:30.560 --> 02:36.280
(Rayanne)<i> To stop drinking,</i>
<i>but this time really stop.</i>

02:37.760 --> 02:41.480
(Patty)
<i>I resolve to be less judgmental,</i>

02:41.560 --> 02:43.480
<i>less critical, to lighten up.</i>

02:43.560 --> 02:48.560
<i>And above all, to be more</i>
<i>supportive and less suspicious,</i>

02:48.640 --> 02:51.280
<i>no matter how much</i>
<i>it sometimes seems</i>

02:51.360 --> 02:53.440
<i>like he's hiding something.</i>

02:54.360 --> 02:56.400
(Graham)<i> To tell Hallie</i>
<i>Lowenthal once and for all,</i>

02:56.480 --> 02:58.840
<i>that I'm not going into the</i>
<i>restaurant business with her...</i>

03:00.600 --> 03:03.360
<i>and to stop all those long talks</i>
<i>with her after class.</i>

03:05.520 --> 03:09.960
(Jordan)<i> Wait a second,</i>
<i>Isn't tonight New Year's Eve?</i>

03:11.360 --> 03:13.960
(Dick Clark)
<i>Listen to that crowd.</i>

03:14.040 --> 03:17.840
<i>Not much time left as you</i>
<i>can see by the digital clock...</i>

03:17.920 --> 03:20.120
(Angela)<i> Okay,</i>
<i>so I'll stay Introspective...</i>

03:20.760 --> 03:24.080
<i>but I do resolve to stop doing</i>
<i>Jordan Catalano's homework.</i>

03:24.160 --> 03:27.240
(Dick Clark)
<i>Here it comes in ten seconds.</i>

03:27.320 --> 03:33.680
(crowd on TV)
<i>Nine, eight, seven, six,</i>

03:33.760 --> 03:40.360
<i>five, four, three, two, one.</i>

03:40.440 --> 03:42.200
(Dick Clark)
<i>Happy New Year's rocking Eve.</i>

03:42.280 --> 03:45.240
-(Danielle) Happy New Year!
-(blows)

03:45.320 --> 03:49.760
(audience cheering on TV)

03:50.360 --> 03:52.360
(laughs)

03:55.880 --> 03:57.800
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

03:57.880 --> 03:59.400
Happy New Year.

04:00.440 --> 04:04.880
-(audience cheering on TV)
-(piano music playing)

04:04.960 --> 04:06.320
-Great pancakes!
-Thanks...

04:06.400 --> 04:08.280
I just did
what it said on the package.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.280
Damn, I wrote ninety-four.
I'm going to be late.

04:12.360 --> 04:14.120
My green sweater disappeared.

04:14.200 --> 04:17.200
No, it's under the coffee table
next to the stack of magazines.

04:17.280 --> 04:19.040
-There's a stack of magazines?
-There is now.

04:19.120 --> 04:21.320
Listen, I'm going to try
and get home early tonight

04:21.400 --> 04:23.200
-after my class?
-Oh.

04:23.280 --> 04:27.000
-Oh, no, you don't have to rush home.
-I don't?

04:27.080 --> 04:31.080
No, you take all the time you need,
it's whatever makes you happy.

04:31.160 --> 04:32.520
-It is?
-Yes.

04:32.600 --> 04:36.880
-You're doing the dishes again?
-(Patty) Okay, I'm out of here,

04:36.960 --> 04:40.480
you guys have a great first day
back at school.

04:40.560 --> 04:42.160
-You have a good day at work.
-Ha, ha.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.960
Tonight's Hollandaise, right?

04:44.040 --> 04:45.680
-Right!
-Well, good luck.

04:45.760 --> 04:48.720
Come on, we're going
to be late for the bus.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.520
I forgot my other glove.
It's freezing out there!

04:51.600 --> 04:53.040
If only he had come into our lives

04:53.120 --> 04:55.000
when the girls were still young
and impressionable.

04:55.080 --> 04:56.800
Rickie? He's incredible.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.520
Now that he reorganized
the linen closet,

04:59.600 --> 05:02.320
you can't use a dish
without washing it.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.160
And he's like my mother,
only mature.

05:05.240 --> 05:08.720
-We should adopt.
-If only it were that easy.

05:08.800 --> 05:11.480
God, he is such a great kid,
I mean, what is going on?

05:11.560 --> 05:13.360
Why haven't we heard
from his aunt and uncle?

05:13.440 --> 05:15.680
-He's been here a week!
-I forgot my Odyssey.

05:15.760 --> 05:18.440
-(Graham) I've tried to ask him about it.
-(Patty) I know.

05:18.520 --> 05:21.720
He just changes the subject.
I mean, don't they care?

05:21.800 --> 05:23.800
Do they even know where he is?

05:23.880 --> 05:25.280
(Graham)
Should I talk to him again?

05:25.360 --> 05:28.400
Well, we have to try to contact
his family, or he has to...

05:28.480 --> 05:30.720
I mean, he can't
just stay here forever.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.960
-(mellow music playing)
-(slams book)

05:34.960 --> 05:36.120
(chuckles)

05:36.200 --> 05:40.160
Okay. Let's just get down to basics.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.800
Did anyone start the book?

05:46.000 --> 05:48.480
Anyone read the book jacket?

05:49.880 --> 05:51.520
Okay...

05:53.360 --> 05:57.960
I haven't had a cup of coffee
in almost twelve hours...

05:58.040 --> 05:59.920
I need a little help here!

06:00.000 --> 06:04.320
What does Odysseus... want?

06:08.440 --> 06:10.120
Enrique?

06:11.560 --> 06:12.800
Any thoughts?

06:13.640 --> 06:16.080
Uh, to...

06:17.600 --> 06:18.520
To what?

06:20.040 --> 06:22.160
(bell rings)

06:22.240 --> 06:23.280
Hold it!

06:23.360 --> 06:28.520
I want everyone to write two pages,
due tomorrow, on what does Odysseus want.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.880
No excuses!

06:32.800 --> 06:34.840
(chuckles)

06:38.000 --> 06:39.840
(Angela)
<i>The thing about resolutions is,</i>

06:39.920 --> 06:44.120
<i>it's hard to remember them around</i>
<i>somebody like Jordan Catalano.</i>

06:44.200 --> 06:45.360
This is wrong.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.280
What?

06:49.760 --> 06:54.360
You... doing my homework,
it's wrong.

06:54.440 --> 06:55.800
I was just trying to help.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.920
It's like I'm taking advantage
of you or something.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.440
You're not
taking advantage of me.

07:03.520 --> 07:07.000
Yes, I am. It would
be different if we were, like...

07:09.560 --> 07:12.120
but now you're just...

07:13.600 --> 07:17.280
you know, a friend or whatever.

07:17.360 --> 07:21.120
-(bike engine sputtering)
-(whistle blows)

07:22.080 --> 07:23.400
I can't do this anymore.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.600
(Angela)<i> I couldn't believe it,</i>
<i>for the first time in my life,</i>

07:30.680 --> 07:33.200
<i>I actually stuck to a resolution.</i>

07:33.280 --> 07:34.400
-(bell rings)
-(laughs)

07:34.480 --> 07:36.160
-(girl) Hey, Cherski!
-Hi!

07:37.920 --> 07:39.120
(boy) Hey, it's Sharon!

07:41.600 --> 07:42.760
(groans)

07:45.240 --> 07:46.960
Excuse me, we're here.

07:49.320 --> 07:51.040
Sharon, are you avoiding me?

07:51.120 --> 07:54.920
What? Kyle, isn't that a little
self-centered on your part

07:55.000 --> 07:58.680
to think that people are
spending their day avoiding you?

07:58.760 --> 08:00.360
Can you open the door, please?

08:04.000 --> 08:07.160
(Vinnovich) Later, Graff,
this place is too crowded.

08:07.960 --> 08:09.800
-(Vinnovich) Hey, Phil.
-Hey, Vinnovich.

08:10.560 --> 08:13.280
-I know why you've been avoiding me.
-You do?

08:13.360 --> 08:16.080
Yes, because you think that
what happened the other night

08:16.160 --> 08:18.000
didn't mean as much
to me as it did to you.

08:18.800 --> 08:22.080
It did. I love you, Sharon.

08:22.160 --> 08:23.440
(laughter)

08:23.520 --> 08:25.120
-Sorry.
-(Kyle) That's right.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.760
She's a witness, I love you
and I don't care who knows it.

08:28.400 --> 08:32.120
So... that's all I want to say.

08:32.200 --> 08:34.240
(mellow music playing)

08:43.520 --> 08:47.160
So, Brad is completely putuzed

08:47.240 --> 08:50.280
about whether my gown
should be ivory or bisque.

08:50.360 --> 08:53.920
And I'm like, can't we just
elope to Monte Carlo? (laughs)

08:54.000 --> 08:56.800
Listen,
I need to clarify something.

08:58.280 --> 09:01.560
-You're not going to do the restaurant.
-No, I'm not.

09:01.640 --> 09:04.920
I'm a sane person, I have no desire
to squander my family's savings.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.160
So, we really should stop
talking about it 'cause... what?

09:10.240 --> 09:14.240
Nothing! It's fine. What,
you wanted an argument?

09:14.320 --> 09:16.520
Well, no, no, I just...

09:17.600 --> 09:20.280
No, great!
I'm glad we discussed it.

09:20.360 --> 09:23.000
Me, too because I found this
absolutely fantastic space

09:23.080 --> 09:24.120
that you can get for a song.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.000
No, it's perfect,
now that you're not involved,

09:26.080 --> 09:27.560
you can give me
an objective opinion.

09:27.640 --> 09:32.840
It's got this truly amazing
bronze fountain with mermaids!

09:32.920 --> 09:35.720
(chuckles) It's a storefront
down by the train station!

09:35.800 --> 09:36.840
Hallie.

09:39.520 --> 09:42.520
So, does the fountain work?

09:46.960 --> 09:48.280
(car door opens)

09:49.160 --> 09:50.720
So I can't even wear lipstick?

09:50.800 --> 09:54.160
For fun? Around the house?
Yes. To school? No.

09:54.240 --> 09:57.600
How about if I wear it for fun,
and then we go out for pizza?

09:58.400 --> 10:03.120
How about just to take a walk?
How about in our driveway?

10:03.200 --> 10:05.080
Danielle!

10:05.160 --> 10:08.720
-Daddy! Daddy, hi!
-Hi.

10:08.800 --> 10:12.920
Hi! So I guess
you stayed late after all.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.760
-Yes. Sorry.
-No, that's okay, really!

10:16.840 --> 10:19.240
I got stuck talking
to Hallie Lowenthal.

10:19.320 --> 10:22.480
Did you?
That's great, how is Hallie?

10:22.560 --> 10:26.960
She's fine, I told her I wasn't
doing this restaurant thing.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.000
Oh, good.

10:29.080 --> 10:32.040
I mean, that's what
you wanted to tell her, right?

10:32.120 --> 10:35.240
Wha... I mean, isn't that what
you wanted me to tell her?

10:36.040 --> 10:38.560
Only if that's
what you really want?

10:38.640 --> 10:40.720
(footsteps approaching)

10:41.320 --> 10:45.240
-Rickie! What's up?
-Nothing! I'm just going home.

10:45.320 --> 10:48.480
-What? When?
-Um...

10:49.600 --> 10:54.680
I guess now. I talked to Angela,
Tino's going to pick me up.

10:54.760 --> 10:59.320
-So, how did Hollandaise go?
-It was fine. Listen, Rickie...

10:59.400 --> 11:02.920
Rickie, are you sure
that this is what you want?

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
Yes, yes, I talked to them,
my aunt and uncle, and...

11:07.080 --> 11:09.000
you know, really talked to them,
straightened it all out

11:09.080 --> 11:11.280
and I think things are
really going to work out.

11:11.360 --> 11:14.320
So, look, I really thank
you guys, but, you know,

11:14.400 --> 11:16.800
-they're like my family, so...
-Wait a second.

11:16.880 --> 11:19.000
Rickie, we want to talk
to your aunt and uncle.

11:19.080 --> 11:20.000
No, no, no, I know!

11:20.080 --> 11:23.080
And she's been meaning to call
and thank you or whatever,

11:23.160 --> 11:25.680
but I think
she's a little embarrassed.

11:25.760 --> 11:28.200
So, thank you...

11:29.120 --> 11:31.480
for everything. And...

11:33.200 --> 11:36.520
-Bye.
-Bye.

11:36.600 --> 11:37.880
(door closes)

11:39.560 --> 11:42.240
(dramatic music playing)

11:54.040 --> 11:56.120
(bell rings)

11:56.200 --> 12:00.040
Everybody, I want those Odysseus
essays before you leave.

12:00.120 --> 12:03.480
And, you should all
be on page 50 by Friday.

12:03.560 --> 12:06.560
Yes... thank you.

12:08.320 --> 12:10.320
(indistinct chatter)

12:15.480 --> 12:18.800
-You gave up caffeine, too?
-Oh, my God...

12:18.880 --> 12:21.440
I was just staying
at a friend's house.

12:21.520 --> 12:24.400
Angela Chase, she's in your
other sophomore English

12:24.480 --> 12:26.720
the girl with the red hair
that's kind of growing out.

12:27.960 --> 12:29.800
Where is your essay?

12:30.840 --> 12:31.760
Um...

12:32.640 --> 12:36.160
See, her little sister had
this really, really bad headache

12:36.240 --> 12:40.000
and I had to go with her
to the emergency room.

12:40.080 --> 12:44.400
So I actually didn't get a chance
to actually do the assignment.

12:44.480 --> 12:48.640
-Rickie?
-Hi. How's your sister feeling?

12:50.480 --> 12:53.920
-Fine.
-Oh, my God, I better get to Soc.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.360
Um... wait, Rickie!

12:58.160 --> 13:01.680
Rayanne is all concerned.
You have to tell her everything is okay...

13:03.120 --> 13:04.400
I mean, everything is okay,
right?

13:04.480 --> 13:07.040
-Of course, of course.
-Well, tell Rayanne, okay?

13:07.120 --> 13:09.080
She thinks my mom kicked you
out or something,

13:09.160 --> 13:12.160
-she's driving me crazy.
-Okay, I'll talk to her. Later.

13:14.800 --> 13:19.080
Wait. Yes. Angela.

13:19.160 --> 13:21.960
So Rickie stayed
at your house last night?

13:22.040 --> 13:23.200
No.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.920
Oh.
I must be confused, I thought...

13:26.000 --> 13:28.560
No, he was, now he's back with his family.

13:28.640 --> 13:32.520
I mean, everything is calmed
down over there now, I guess.

13:32.600 --> 13:33.920
I mean, I hope so, because...

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
Well, good. Yes, I hope so, too.

13:37.080 --> 13:40.200
Um...
can I just ask you something?

13:41.200 --> 13:46.320
Say there's someone who's really
smart in a lot of ways,

13:46.400 --> 13:48.840
but isn't doing real well in school,
especially in English.

13:48.920 --> 13:49.960
Say no more.

13:51.520 --> 13:55.920
The sign-up sheet
for the peer tutoring program,

13:56.000 --> 13:58.640
you can start right
after school today.

13:58.720 --> 14:01.640
(serene music playing)

14:05.480 --> 14:06.680
Thanks.

14:06.760 --> 14:09.040
-(mellow music playing)
-(indistinct chatter)

14:13.080 --> 14:14.960
(Rayanne) Come on,
Cherski, work those abs!

14:15.040 --> 14:19.400
-Why are you even here? Quit it!
-Come on, it makes it easier.

14:19.480 --> 14:23.280
I keep reliving that moment
with you and Kyle.

14:23.360 --> 14:25.160
Shut up.

14:25.240 --> 14:29.040
I still can't believe the fact of it.

14:29.120 --> 14:32.680
How he declared his love for you.

14:33.320 --> 14:34.680
So this is it for you now,
you know,

14:34.760 --> 14:37.680
because you're totally
fulfilled, right? Right?

14:39.600 --> 14:42.120
See, Kyle and I
had broken up officially.

14:42.200 --> 14:44.720
But then, New Year's Eve,

14:44.800 --> 14:47.480
I was watching that
<i>River Runs Through It</i> movie

14:47.560 --> 14:50.320
and he called, and...

14:51.160 --> 14:54.000
Oh, gosh, what is wrong with me?

14:54.080 --> 14:57.640
-Look, take me and Bobby...
-Who's Bobby?

14:57.720 --> 14:59.680
That guy I was with when you
and Kyle interrupted us?

14:59.760 --> 15:01.720
That guy's name is Phil.

15:01.800 --> 15:05.360
Whatever, it's not like Bill
and I are in love or anything.

15:05.440 --> 15:06.400
Phil!

15:06.480 --> 15:10.480
Whatever! I mean, you don't have
to be in love to have a good time.

15:10.560 --> 15:15.160
Yes, but let's say he loved you
while you were just using him

15:15.240 --> 15:17.960
for, you know...

15:18.800 --> 15:22.240
because you were
watching this movie.

15:23.240 --> 15:24.560
What movie?

15:24.640 --> 15:28.240
This Brad Pitt movie.

15:28.920 --> 15:30.080
Say no more.

15:30.160 --> 15:35.600
Yes. And then say
you call Phil over, or Bill.

15:35.680 --> 15:39.440
-Say I call both of them.
-No, wait, wait.

15:39.520 --> 15:43.600
Let's say though, that you had
a better time then you used to

15:43.680 --> 15:47.880
when you were technically
supposed to love him,

15:47.960 --> 15:51.480
like a much better time.

15:54.240 --> 15:56.120
Is this that really dull movie
with all the fishing?

15:56.200 --> 15:57.680
Mmm.

15:57.760 --> 16:01.120
I'm going to Kyle,
I'm going to tell him the truth

16:01.200 --> 16:05.280
and then I'm going to never
have sex again with anyone

16:05.360 --> 16:08.960
until I know it's absolutely
the exact right person

16:09.040 --> 16:11.720
and I am in complete
and total love.

16:11.800 --> 16:15.760
I just hope Brad Pitt is available
and in the tri-state area.

16:19.280 --> 16:20.640
-Oh.
-Oh!

16:20.720 --> 16:24.920
-Sorry!
-No, I was just... uh...

16:25.560 --> 16:28.240
It's freezing out there.
My car didn't almost start.

16:28.320 --> 16:32.640
It's freezing in here...
(exhales) but isn't it great?

16:33.720 --> 16:36.520
Personally, I see a dance floor.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.280
Another roller rink.

16:38.360 --> 16:42.120
You know, Brad has this theory
about you. You look so alarmed.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.440
I'm always alarmed when anyone's
actually talked about me.

16:44.520 --> 16:48.360
He thinks you secretly and
passionately yearn to do this,

16:48.440 --> 16:52.480
and if you don't you'll kill yourself
or somebody else, or something.

16:54.200 --> 16:55.400
Brad said this about me?

16:57.040 --> 16:59.240
Brad is surprisingly perceptive!

16:59.320 --> 17:01.960
So?
(knocks) What do you think?

17:04.240 --> 17:05.880
Well, it needs a little work.

17:07.680 --> 17:13.040
(sighs) No, seriously, I need to
know what you think, I mean...

17:13.120 --> 17:16.920
I am going to do this and I understand,
of course, that you aren't.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.760
But I just need to know
what you think.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.160
I think it's wonderful.

17:24.080 --> 17:26.480
That's Great! Then you'll do it!

17:26.560 --> 17:29.920
No! This is why
I almost didn't come!

17:30.000 --> 17:32.600
Get me out of here!
I will see you in class.

17:32.680 --> 17:33.960
Brad has
another theory about you.

17:34.040 --> 17:34.880
I don't wanna know.

17:34.960 --> 17:37.320
He says you'll cave in
at the last minute.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.680
Bye.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.960
(sighs) Yes!

17:50.160 --> 17:51.080
What?

17:51.160 --> 17:55.520
Let's just say that Graham has
a little input, output confusion.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.960
-I'm almost done.
-Thanks, Neil, that's great.

17:58.040 --> 18:00.440
Want me to explain to you
what the problem is?

18:00.520 --> 18:01.600
No.

18:02.960 --> 18:04.720
So, I guess Graham told you

18:04.800 --> 18:07.520
that he decided not to open
the restaurant.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.240
I'm actually kind of sorry
about it,

18:09.320 --> 18:11.840
I mean,
that I wasn't more supportive.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.160
What restaurant?

18:15.360 --> 18:19.200
You mean he didn't tell you
about this restaurant

18:19.280 --> 18:21.040
that he was thinking
about opening?

18:21.120 --> 18:23.240
My brother was thinking
about opening a restaurant?

18:23.320 --> 18:24.640
By himself?
(laughing)

18:24.720 --> 18:27.640
Well, no, as a matter of fact his partner
was supposed to be...

18:27.720 --> 18:31.360
-You know, that woman?
-Which woman is this?

18:31.440 --> 18:34.280
You know,
that Hallie Lowenthal woman.

18:34.360 --> 18:36.720
-Hallie?
-Lowenthal.

18:37.320 --> 18:42.080
He didn't tell you about Hallie Lowenthal
from his cooking class?

18:42.160 --> 18:46.840
Ah. Wait, wait,
what's her name again? Holly?

18:46.920 --> 18:49.160
Hallie Lowenthal.

18:50.880 --> 18:56.320
Right, yes.
Yes! Yes! Of course! Hallie.

18:58.240 --> 19:02.960
I really should wear a watch,
is what I should do.

19:03.040 --> 19:05.520
-Hey!
-Hey.

19:05.600 --> 19:08.400
I just was a...
What are you doing here?

19:08.480 --> 19:10.800
Fixed the stereo. Want to
know what the problem was?

19:10.880 --> 19:15.480
-No.
-So, um, oh, great! Hi. (laughs)

19:15.560 --> 19:19.760
Um, I have to go upstairs.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.800
-What did you say to her?
-Nothing. Why, what did you do?

19:31.880 --> 19:36.160
Nothing, Shut up! Nothing.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.280
(bell rings)

19:40.360 --> 19:42.200
Wait, you actually signed me up?

19:42.280 --> 19:45.080
I know, in a way it was wrong,
but I just have a feeling

19:45.160 --> 19:46.800
that this is going
to be really good.

19:46.880 --> 19:48.800
I don't know.

19:48.880 --> 19:52.080
Whoever is going to tutor you,
their name is next to yours.

19:53.200 --> 19:55.360
"Brain Krakow?"

19:56.000 --> 19:57.800
Wait, maybe this is a bad idea.

19:57.880 --> 20:00.560
No, I mean,
if I'm already signed up.

20:04.760 --> 20:09.480
-Are you, "Brain"?
-Brian.

20:09.560 --> 20:12.480
(indistinct chatter)

20:16.480 --> 20:18.360
We are drama club!

20:19.440 --> 20:22.840
Come on, give me some drama!

20:22.920 --> 20:25.880
(screaming and yelling)

20:29.520 --> 20:31.080
Okay, all right.

20:33.200 --> 20:36.800
But if you move, don't you
leave a forwarding number?

20:36.880 --> 20:40.160
I mean, is there a number?

20:41.520 --> 20:43.920
Because they wouldn't just move
without telling me.

20:46.160 --> 20:48.600
Because that would be crazy...

20:49.640 --> 20:51.480
that would be impossible...

20:52.720 --> 20:56.040
because people just don't do that...

20:57.960 --> 20:59.520
do they?

21:00.240 --> 21:01.240
Enrique?

21:01.320 --> 21:04.320
(mellow music playing)

21:06.640 --> 21:07.880
Enrique?

21:14.960 --> 21:16.200
Enrique?

21:16.280 --> 21:19.080
(mellow music continues)

21:26.520 --> 21:29.520
(Angela) My So-called life
<i>will continue here on ABC.</i>

21:35.160 --> 21:39.800
(theme music playing)

21:49.240 --> 21:50.960
(knocks lightly on door)

21:52.600 --> 21:56.720
-Enrique.
-Mr. Katimski?

21:56.800 --> 21:58.440
Gee whiz, you're here early.

21:59.160 --> 22:03.920
Could I speak to you
before class about the Odyssey?

22:04.000 --> 22:06.400
Of course! Come on.

22:18.320 --> 22:21.880
If you wanna take that doughnut
off my hands by the way,

22:21.960 --> 22:24.960
be my guest, I gave up
coffee for New Year's,

22:25.040 --> 22:27.600
it's kind of taken the point
out of doughnuts.

22:31.280 --> 22:32.680
What's up?

22:32.760 --> 22:37.440
Okay, well, you know that essay
that I never handed in

22:37.520 --> 22:39.720
about what Odysseus wants?

22:39.800 --> 22:45.040
-Can I get an extension on that?
-Okay.

22:46.200 --> 22:49.440
Because I read it,
it's about this lonely guy

22:49.520 --> 22:52.640
that wanders the world
for many years, right?

22:52.720 --> 22:53.840
Right.

22:53.920 --> 22:58.080
And the way that it starts
in the middle.

22:58.160 --> 23:01.120
What's that called again?
I know you told us...

23:01.200 --> 23:04.520
-"En medius res".
-Right.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.760
It's in the middle of things.

23:08.960 --> 23:10.400
Right.

23:12.600 --> 23:13.840
Um...

23:14.880 --> 23:19.840
Because see, right now
it's sort of like...

23:21.720 --> 23:24.720
it's sort of like
I don't have a place to live.

23:24.800 --> 23:26.520
(serene music playing)

23:29.160 --> 23:30.240
Oh, God.

23:31.360 --> 23:33.840
(stammering)
What happened?

23:33.920 --> 23:38.480
But, I mean, it's okay,
it's actually going to be fine.

23:39.680 --> 23:42.600
I was staying at my friend
Angela's house for a while...

23:43.840 --> 23:45.160
and they're really nice...

23:46.080 --> 23:48.760
they're this really great
family...

23:51.520 --> 23:53.720
but in a way
that made me feel lonelier...

23:54.920 --> 23:56.720
And I know that sounds
ungrateful...

23:56.800 --> 23:58.320
No, no, no, I understand.

24:01.360 --> 24:02.760
And see, my uncle...

24:03.920 --> 24:06.320
I was living with my aunt
and uncle because...

24:07.640 --> 24:09.960
well, it's sort of a long
story...

24:10.040 --> 24:13.720
And you're certain that your
aunt and uncle have relocated?

24:15.160 --> 24:18.800
-I'm certain.
-So, Kathy, obviously, he can't,

24:18.880 --> 24:21.000
I mean, there has to be some
solution here.

24:21.080 --> 24:25.160
Well, actually, I'm thinking
of a place for, is it Enrique?

24:27.040 --> 24:30.040
It's Rickie, but
actually I was thinking that...

24:30.120 --> 24:32.560
I could get a job or maybe
even an apartment.

24:32.640 --> 24:35.000
Rickie, I got to say,
I'm not sure that's realistic.

24:35.600 --> 24:38.400
The place I'm thinking of for
you is called Pride House.

24:38.480 --> 24:41.720
What kind of a place is that?

24:41.800 --> 24:43.400
Well, a friend of a
friend of mine runs it

24:43.480 --> 24:45.280
and it's got a really warm
atmosphere,

24:45.360 --> 24:49.720
has a super dedicated staff and
it's great, it's almost like a family.

24:49.800 --> 24:51.040
-(bell rings)
-Well.

24:51.120 --> 24:53.360
That sounds pretty good,
doesn't it?

24:54.480 --> 24:55.640
Yes, I guess.

24:55.720 --> 24:58.480
Let me make a few calls
and I'll pull in a few favors

24:58.560 --> 25:01.080
and we'll see what we can do.

25:01.160 --> 25:04.360
Go to your next class and I'll let
you know when we know something.

25:04.440 --> 25:06.920
Well, good! This sounds,
(chuckles)

25:07.000 --> 25:08.880
My goodness,
I've got a class myself.

25:08.960 --> 25:13.280
All right. Are you okay?
You need another doughnut?

25:13.360 --> 25:15.720
No, I'm fine, thanks.

25:19.920 --> 25:22.800
-Welcome.
-Richard, I'm on hold here.

25:22.880 --> 25:25.920
Listen, a place like Pride House
has a waiting list, you know?

25:26.000 --> 25:27.360
I mean, assuming he's qualified,

25:27.440 --> 25:29.320
even if I pull every string
known to man,

25:29.400 --> 25:31.640
it's going to take a few weeks
to get him in.

25:31.720 --> 25:35.440
No, but, Kathy, that's... what
is he supposed to do tonight?

25:35.520 --> 25:37.520
It's not a perfect system.

25:39.080 --> 25:43.440
-Yes, I'll hold.
-No. It isn't.

25:46.440 --> 25:50.200
-So, Happy New Year.
-What? Yes, right.

25:50.280 --> 25:52.680
So, how's everything?
How's Delia Fisher?

25:52.760 --> 25:55.080
-What do you want, Krakow?
-Nothing, why?

25:55.160 --> 25:56.840
Why would I want anything?
I don't want anything.

25:56.920 --> 26:00.160
-I just need like a favor.
-Involving Delia Fisher?

26:00.240 --> 26:02.640
-Involving Jordan Catalano.
-(metal rumbles)

26:02.720 --> 26:05.160
-I was put with him for tutoring.
-So?

26:05.240 --> 26:06.920
So I'd just rather not tutor him,
I mean...

26:07.000 --> 26:10.320
you have someone you're tutoring,
so could you switch with me?

26:12.840 --> 26:15.240
So you and Kyle
are back together now?

26:15.320 --> 26:20.360
No, no, it's just...
I can't discuss it, okay?

26:21.160 --> 26:25.760
-So, why can't you tutor Jordan Catalano?
-I can't discuss it either.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.160
Because it just makes me feel

26:29.240 --> 26:31.280
-like a hypocrite or something, you know?
-(squeaks)

26:31.600 --> 26:35.840
-(squeaks)
-Yeah, I do actually.

26:36.440 --> 26:39.520
"I love you beary much"?
Oh, my God!

26:39.600 --> 26:41.480
Shut up!

26:41.560 --> 26:43.760
Wait, wait, Cherski, wait.
I mean,

26:43.840 --> 26:45.480
just this whole situation,

26:45.560 --> 26:47.960
see it's like I can't
even look at him, so...

26:48.040 --> 26:49.720
-I know.
-(squeaks)

26:49.800 --> 26:51.880
It just really boils down
to respect, you know.

26:51.960 --> 26:57.680
I have zero respect for him, so for me
to tutor someone that I don't respect,

26:57.760 --> 26:59.560
wouldn't that almost
be like using him?

26:59.640 --> 27:02.240
It is definitely wrong
to use people.

27:02.320 --> 27:05.120
-So you'll switch with me?
-No. No, that won't solve it.

27:05.200 --> 27:06.720
That's like the cowards'
way out.

27:06.800 --> 27:09.280
Well, I mean, I can live
with that, because, you know,

27:09.360 --> 27:13.800
-I kind of am a coward, so...
-No. No, you have to be honest,

27:13.880 --> 27:16.160
you have to tell him
that it was a mistake

27:16.240 --> 27:18.520
and that you can't pretend anymore

27:18.600 --> 27:20.320
and that whole using him thing

27:20.400 --> 27:24.080
and that you know,
you didn't want to hurt him!

27:24.880 --> 27:26.600
(squeaks)

27:27.080 --> 27:28.440
(bell rings)

27:28.520 --> 27:30.800
I'm supposed to say
all that to Jordan Catalano?

27:31.960 --> 27:34.000
-Hey, Cherski!
-(squeaks)

27:34.080 --> 27:36.400
-(girl) Cute bear, Krakow!
-What's the name?

27:36.480 --> 27:38.280
(laughing)

27:38.360 --> 27:41.520
So I basically have no real background
in the type of stuff you're weak in,

27:41.600 --> 27:45.240
so you should probably
just resign up and...

27:45.320 --> 27:48.520
-Where's my pen?
-(squeak)

27:49.200 --> 27:52.520
-What's that bear?
-Oh. (chuckles)

27:52.600 --> 27:55.920
That? That's just this
thing this girl gave me.

27:56.000 --> 27:56.960
Yes?

27:58.800 --> 28:03.080
I think I should tell you, even
though I signed up to tutor people...

28:03.160 --> 28:06.480
I may have to drop out
of the program or whatever...

28:06.560 --> 28:09.600
Do you have an eraser
I could use for a second?

28:09.680 --> 28:13.440
-Um, I think so...
-My eraser won't erase.

28:13.520 --> 28:15.720
-Here you can keep it.
-Thanks.

28:20.480 --> 28:24.640
-What?
-She would sleep with you.

28:24.720 --> 28:25.880
What?

28:26.520 --> 28:32.320
-She would sleep with you.
-Because I gave her my eraser?

28:32.400 --> 28:37.400
No, because... she would.

28:40.240 --> 28:43.880
-Go get her number.
-What? (laughing)

28:43.960 --> 28:46.640
How am I supposed to get
her number, I just ask her,

28:46.720 --> 28:49.680
just ask some girl I don't even
know for her phone number

28:49.760 --> 28:51.160
without warning?

28:55.280 --> 29:01.000
(upbeat music playing)

29:12.160 --> 29:14.120
So, anyway...

29:14.200 --> 29:19.360
the Odyssey is this real
long book, right, and...

29:19.440 --> 29:21.840
I don't believe this. I don't.

29:22.880 --> 29:24.240
You do this?

29:25.560 --> 29:26.920
This is how you live?

29:28.200 --> 29:29.440
Yes.

29:32.120 --> 29:35.720
(laughing together)

29:36.640 --> 29:40.440
-Hi. What's so funny?
-Nothing.

29:40.520 --> 29:43.560
-You sort of had to be there.
-(laughing together)

29:48.480 --> 29:50.760
I have to sharpen my pencil.

29:51.360 --> 29:53.360
(laughing)

29:56.920 --> 29:59.960
Look, if this is weird for you,
being tutored.

30:00.040 --> 30:02.240
I don't mind
helping you a little longer.

30:03.640 --> 30:05.960
It's not so weird.

30:06.520 --> 30:08.480
So... (chuckles)

30:09.200 --> 30:10.800
Good.

30:12.160 --> 30:14.640
You could have sex
with me though...

30:14.720 --> 30:17.360
-(laughing)
-...if you really want to help.

30:17.440 --> 30:20.560
Oh, God.

30:20.640 --> 30:22.480
(laughing)

30:23.840 --> 30:27.800
-Oh, my God.
-I guess that's a no.

30:27.880 --> 30:30.000
(Angela laughing)

30:34.360 --> 30:37.280
I'll let you get back
to your work. (laughing)

30:40.920 --> 30:43.320
-(phone rings)
-Have a seat.

30:43.400 --> 30:44.560
(slams door)

30:47.080 --> 30:48.120
Enrique.

30:48.200 --> 30:51.560
They came and got me out of class.
So did she reach them, or...

30:52.520 --> 30:53.800
No.

30:56.040 --> 30:56.920
I mean...

30:57.000 --> 30:59.920
Mr. Katimski, I just want to thank you
for taking the time out,

31:00.000 --> 31:05.760
because that Pride place Ms. Krazy
whatever her name is, it sounded good.

31:05.840 --> 31:09.200
And I would have never gone
to guidance by myself, so thanks.

31:09.280 --> 31:12.880
-Look, Rickie.
-Wait, you called me Rickie.

31:13.960 --> 31:18.440
They don't, well,
you're on the waiting list.

31:20.440 --> 31:21.280
Oh.

31:21.360 --> 31:23.200
Which is good,
which is very good.

31:23.280 --> 31:25.680
The only thing
is the immediate problem.

31:25.760 --> 31:30.400
So, Mrs. Krzynowski has temporarily
placed you in a facility.

31:31.680 --> 31:36.280
-(stutters) What do you mean, you mean...
-No, it's not forever.

31:36.360 --> 31:37.760
(stutters) But what?
Is it like...

31:37.840 --> 31:40.560
Look, I don't... Rickie...

31:40.640 --> 31:42.760
-No, no, okay. I know.
-I mean...

31:43.800 --> 31:46.880
She wants to see you in her office.

31:47.720 --> 31:49.960
She needs to fill out some forms.

31:50.040 --> 31:54.280
-Uh... Sure.
-Enrique, wait.

31:55.360 --> 31:58.520
I know this is going to work out.

31:59.320 --> 32:01.400
Yeah, me, too.

32:01.480 --> 32:04.320
(mellow music playing)

32:06.960 --> 32:09.960
Come on, stop it!
God, you are relentless!

32:10.040 --> 32:11.240
I'm home!

32:12.720 --> 32:16.040
I don't care what
his theory is. What?

32:16.120 --> 32:19.040
Hang on a second.
Hi, it's Hallie Lowenthal.

32:19.120 --> 32:22.160
-Oh, tell her hi.
-Patty says hi.

32:22.240 --> 32:24.480
(laughs)

32:25.560 --> 32:28.840
-Yes, she says hi back.
-Great! Fabulous.

32:28.920 --> 32:30.840
-What?
-Nothing.

32:30.920 --> 32:34.120
-No, I was just...
-Sorry. So sorry.

32:34.200 --> 32:36.800
-I should get off the phone.
-No, don't get off the phone.

32:36.880 --> 32:38.960
Okay, I will talk to you in class!

32:41.400 --> 32:43.360
(laughs)

32:43.440 --> 32:44.920
She just wanted to ask
me something.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.960
No problem.

32:47.040 --> 32:49.760
So you are considering going
into business

32:49.840 --> 32:53.880
-with Hallie or you aren't?
-I'm not. I told you that.

32:53.960 --> 32:57.360
Okay, it was just a question,
it wasn't a criticism.

32:58.960 --> 33:03.920
You know, you never told me what
your New Year's resolution was.

33:05.600 --> 33:07.880
Exercise more.

33:09.320 --> 33:10.640
Mine, too.

33:15.480 --> 33:18.480
(tense music playing)

33:22.000 --> 33:23.560
(coughing)

33:28.520 --> 33:31.640
You're going to be sorry.
You're going to be sorry!

33:39.520 --> 33:40.680
Hey, you.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.960
Hey, I'm talking to you,
where are you going?

33:46.040 --> 33:49.480
-(intense music playing)
-(siren blaring indistinctly)

33:50.360 --> 33:52.160
(coughing)

34:04.680 --> 34:06.040
(knock on door)

34:06.120 --> 34:08.720
(Patty)
<i>Will somebody please get the door?</i>

34:14.280 --> 34:16.760
-I need to speak to...
-(Patty) Danielle, who is it?

34:16.840 --> 34:18.960
-I can't tell yet.
-Oh, um...

34:19.040 --> 34:22.600
Hi, I'm looking for Enrique
Vasquez. My name is Richard.

34:22.680 --> 34:24.760
-Mr. Katimski!
-Katimski.

34:24.840 --> 34:28.240
-Why do I know that name?
-Mom, he's my English teacher.

34:28.320 --> 34:32.480
Oh. Oh! Enrique Vasquez,
do you mean, Rickie?

34:32.560 --> 34:35.240
-What happened to Rickie?
-So, Enrique is not here?

34:35.320 --> 34:36.640
No, he isn't, why?

34:36.720 --> 34:38.600
He was brought
to a shelter last night,

34:38.680 --> 34:42.480
but I got a phone call from
one of our counselors this morning...

34:42.560 --> 34:44.560
Aren't they
going to be late, for school?

34:45.400 --> 34:48.400
Oh, uh. Girls, go to school.

34:49.400 --> 34:53.000
Can I get you a cup of coffee,
or something?

34:53.080 --> 34:57.480
No. No coffee. Don't you realize
this boy was under your roof.

34:57.560 --> 35:00.160
Now, how can you
just let him go like that?

35:00.240 --> 35:01.800
-Who are you?
-But Rickie told us...

35:01.880 --> 35:04.680
I don't care what he told you!
Now why did you believe...

35:04.760 --> 35:06.000
(sobbing)

35:06.080 --> 35:11.240
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Forgive me.
Gee whiz. I'm really sorry.

35:11.320 --> 35:14.680
No. No, you're absolutely right!

35:14.760 --> 35:16.000
-We should have called.
-Who are you?

35:16.080 --> 35:19.440
I'm your daughters' English teacher.
I am very sorry.

35:19.520 --> 35:22.560
I have never...
this is not how I normally behave.

35:22.640 --> 35:26.880
No, no, it's okay, because
I have felt so bad about this.

35:26.960 --> 35:28.800
No, see I gave up coffee
for New Year's,

35:28.880 --> 35:32.840
and I'm going through some...
kind of withdrawal and...

35:34.360 --> 35:35.480
forgive me,

35:35.560 --> 35:40.600
I had no right to point a finger
of blame at you, especially since I've...

35:41.360 --> 35:42.800
(sighs)

35:42.880 --> 35:46.960
Your daughter Angela,
a very delightful person by the way,

35:47.040 --> 35:49.200
with a firm grasp of language,

35:49.280 --> 35:52.880
but she doesn't work up
to her full potential.

35:53.840 --> 35:56.000
Are you sure you don't
want a cup of coffee?

35:57.840 --> 35:59.400
The old temptress.

35:59.480 --> 36:01.680
-(dog barking)
-(birds chirping)

36:05.240 --> 36:07.040
I have to tell him
the complete truth.

36:07.120 --> 36:10.320
I can't become the type of person
that would use another person like that,

36:10.400 --> 36:13.520
because I could end up like you!
No offense.

36:13.600 --> 36:17.360
None taken. Hey, Kyle. Cherski
here has something to tell you.

36:17.440 --> 36:20.320
-Shut up!
-Hey! You must have lost this?

36:20.400 --> 36:21.280
Oh.

36:21.360 --> 36:22.800
I found it hanging from a urinal.

36:22.880 --> 36:26.680
Thanks. uh,
Kyle, We have to talk.

36:26.760 --> 36:28.240
Listen, I rented this video,

36:28.320 --> 36:31.080
and I thought maybe we could hang
at your place tonight and watch it?

36:31.160 --> 36:33.320
Kyle, there's something
that I have to explain.

36:33.400 --> 36:37.200
It's that movie where these two housewives
on the run in this convertible

36:37.280 --> 36:39.160
and they're babes,
but they're really old babes?

36:39.240 --> 36:41.480
-Kyle, look.
-Who else is in it?

36:42.160 --> 36:45.600
-You know that guy...
-Brad Pitt?

36:45.680 --> 36:48.360
Yeah! He's hitchhiking,
and they pick him up!

36:48.440 --> 36:50.520
He's wearing a cowboy hat
and no shirt!

36:50.600 --> 36:53.080
And next thing you know,
Brad Pitt and that wacky babe,

36:53.160 --> 36:56.720
are going at it in this
cheap hotel all night long!

36:57.880 --> 36:59.200
What did you want to explain?

37:00.720 --> 37:01.880
Nothing!

37:03.840 --> 37:07.720
-How about 7:30?
-That's fantastic!

37:08.920 --> 37:10.800
(sighs)

37:11.800 --> 37:14.520
God, I cannot believe
how intense that was.

37:15.320 --> 37:16.440
I know.

37:17.640 --> 37:21.080
-I mean, he seems like a sweet guy.
-Oh, absolutely.

37:21.960 --> 37:25.040
I just hope we hear from him.
Rickie.

37:26.360 --> 37:29.360
Well, look, he knows
where we are if he needs us.

37:39.520 --> 37:41.120
Listen, Patty...

37:42.160 --> 37:44.240
there's something
I have to tell you.

37:46.040 --> 37:49.840
It's been kind of weighing on me.

37:53.240 --> 37:57.200
I haven't been
completely honest...

37:57.280 --> 38:00.040
about something and I just can't...

38:00.120 --> 38:03.800
Oh, God, just say it.

38:03.880 --> 38:07.040
Just say it.

38:08.440 --> 38:09.880
I want to open this restaurant.

38:11.480 --> 38:13.120
See, I missed Angela's birth

38:13.200 --> 38:14.760
because I got stuck in that airport,

38:14.840 --> 38:18.760
and I missed college because I did.

38:18.840 --> 38:22.280
And I missed Woodstock twice.

38:22.360 --> 38:26.000
And I don't want to miss this.

38:28.400 --> 38:29.480
(sighs)

38:30.520 --> 38:36.520
I will be totally supportive.

38:36.600 --> 38:40.520
Really?
But I thought, I mean, you mean that?

38:40.600 --> 38:42.760
Yes! God, yes!

38:42.840 --> 38:47.360
I will be unbelievably supportive.

38:50.080 --> 38:53.480
Wait, wait a second!

38:53.560 --> 38:57.160
-What did you think I was going to say?
-Never mind!

39:00.880 --> 39:01.880
Mmm.

39:02.720 --> 39:04.640
That girl who's number you got for me?

39:04.720 --> 39:06.120
She's junior,

39:06.200 --> 39:09.520
so I don't know if you still think
I should call her... I mean...

39:10.880 --> 39:12.560
I cannot stop thinking
about how you did that,

39:12.640 --> 39:15.520
how you just got up
and went over there?

39:16.920 --> 39:19.560
I mean, like,
how did you do that?

39:20.680 --> 39:23.800
-Maybe we better get down to work.
-Okay.

39:25.800 --> 39:29.440
You can even start
with the basics, you know?

39:29.520 --> 39:30.680
Okay.

39:30.760 --> 39:34.120
I mean, even if it seems
like too basic?

39:34.200 --> 39:35.800
Start with that.

39:35.880 --> 39:38.200
And then after if you want,

39:38.280 --> 39:40.600
I can teach you how to get
someone's phone number.

39:41.920 --> 39:44.080
(raining heavily)

39:57.280 --> 39:59.840
(telephone rings)

40:01.720 --> 40:02.680
Hello?

40:02.760 --> 40:06.760
Mr. Katimski? It's me, Enrique.

40:06.840 --> 40:09.240
<i>I'm sorry to bother you, but...</i>

40:09.320 --> 40:13.000
Enrique! You're not,
don't be silly. Where are you?

40:13.080 --> 40:17.360
I'm fine! I'm really fine!
How are you?

40:17.440 --> 40:20.080
Enrique, listen to me.
Do you need a place to stay?

40:21.560 --> 40:24.440
<i>Because I was at the Chases today,</i>
<i>and they care about you.</i>

40:24.520 --> 40:29.520
<i>-You can go back there.</i>
-You were at the Chases? Why?

40:29.600 --> 40:32.400
Because I was worried about you!
I am worried about you!

40:32.480 --> 40:35.400
But, but it's okay! I'm fine,
I'm really fine!

40:35.480 --> 40:37.440
You don't have to worry.

40:38.840 --> 40:42.200
And actually, I found this place to stay.

40:42.280 --> 40:46.120
-What place? Where?
-Just a place.

40:49.560 --> 40:51.800
I can't stay at that shelter.

40:51.880 --> 40:55.680
-I know, Enrique, listen.
-Uh-huh?

40:59.800 --> 41:03.040
Never mind,
we can talk about it tomorrow.

41:03.120 --> 41:06.640
You have a safe place?
To spend the night?

41:12.920 --> 41:14.040
Yes.

41:14.680 --> 41:18.320
Okay. Take care?

41:22.520 --> 41:24.680
(mellow music playing)

41:31.560 --> 41:32.840
(slams telephone)

41:50.640 --> 41:53.520
-Could you please stop doing that?
-No.

41:57.280 --> 41:58.200
(sighs)

41:58.280 --> 42:02.520
So, what's going to happen
to him? The kid?

42:02.600 --> 42:06.080
The kid will be just fine,
if he lives through the night.

42:06.160 --> 42:07.560
That guidance counselor
promised me

42:07.640 --> 42:11.280
that she'd pull some strings
to get him in some group home

42:11.360 --> 42:13.440
it should only take five
or six weeks, it'll be fine!

42:13.520 --> 42:15.720
It was question,
not a criticism.

42:15.800 --> 42:18.960
But you're thinking, why didn't I tell him
that he could stay here tonight.

42:19.040 --> 42:20.440
-You're thinking...
-No, I'm not.

42:20.520 --> 42:23.360
Well, I am!

42:25.920 --> 42:30.480
We all know what could happen
if we did take him in...

42:31.640 --> 42:33.040
if it got out...

42:33.120 --> 42:35.840
you realize what people
could make of it?

42:35.920 --> 42:39.440
-I'd lose my job, be crucified.
-I didn't say anything.

42:39.520 --> 42:41.240
What am I supposed to do?

42:42.040 --> 42:45.040
Just decide like that, that
I'm the solution to some kids life?

42:45.120 --> 42:47.520
How egotistical is that?

42:47.600 --> 42:50.400
God, I just hate myself,
but I can't!

42:51.720 --> 42:53.680
Don't hate yourself.

42:53.760 --> 42:59.760
-(raining, thunder storming indistinctly)
-(Katimski sighs)

43:12.280 --> 43:16.720
-Hallie? Sorry, I didn't see you.
-(alarm blaring indistinctly)

43:16.800 --> 43:20.600
Did I scare you? I do have
that affect on people.

43:21.400 --> 43:23.120
You don't scare me.

43:24.800 --> 43:30.240
So, Patty is really behind
this now, she's very into it.

43:30.320 --> 43:32.840
That's great!
So here's the deal.

43:32.920 --> 43:34.840
I did a major schmooze job
on the landlord,

43:34.920 --> 43:37.200
he said if we sign now,
he'll waive the first two months,

43:37.280 --> 43:39.680
so, worst case we've thrown away
ten months rent,

43:39.760 --> 43:41.840
but at least we'll have a place
to show investors.

43:43.160 --> 43:45.520
I hope to God I haven't
pressured you into this.

43:46.280 --> 43:47.120
Are you crazy?

43:47.200 --> 43:49.400
Of course, you pressured me into
it, no question.

43:49.480 --> 43:51.240
No, be honest.

43:51.320 --> 43:53.920
I mean, people only do
what they want to do,

43:54.000 --> 44:00.000
I mean, uh, you wouldn't be here
if you didn't really want to be, right?

44:00.080 --> 44:02.840
(raining)

44:03.320 --> 44:04.480
You know...

44:05.600 --> 44:09.120
Brad had this theory about you.

44:09.200 --> 44:12.240
Well, actually about me.

44:16.200 --> 44:19.960
He had a theory?
Then he lost it?

44:20.040 --> 44:22.840
No, he probably still has it,
but...

44:23.920 --> 44:27.040
(sighs) We broke up.

44:28.880 --> 44:31.600
What? When did this happen?

44:31.680 --> 44:35.400
We just decided to
not be engaged anymore.

44:35.480 --> 44:38.240
Well, I mean, he decided.

44:40.560 --> 44:45.720
I don't know, it's just,
you know, it's the New Year

44:45.800 --> 44:50.080
and you find yourself
kind of taking stock

44:50.160 --> 44:56.360
or what have you coming
to certain realizations.

44:56.440 --> 45:02.120
(mellow music playing)

45:02.200 --> 45:03.800
I'm really sorry.

45:07.480 --> 45:09.720
So, what was this theory?

45:12.800 --> 45:17.080
God, if I don't get over to that lawyer,
we won't even have a lease!

45:20.480 --> 45:22.120
You won't regret this.

45:25.240 --> 45:29.080
(door opens and closes)

45:32.120 --> 45:35.200
(radio) <i>There's very little</i>
<i>change to look for...</i>

45:35.280 --> 45:36.280
(knock on door)

45:36.360 --> 45:37.640
<i>And the rain is here to stay.</i>

45:37.720 --> 45:41.360
<i>That low-pressure system</i>
<i>we've been watching has remained,</i>

45:41.440 --> 45:43.480
<i>so we can expect</i>
<i>more of the same.</i>

45:52.280 --> 45:54.160
Your address was in the phonebook.

45:57.240 --> 45:58.440
I'm sorry.

45:59.880 --> 46:02.320
It just got so hard to be alone!

46:03.960 --> 46:05.480
(Rickie sobbing)

46:07.040 --> 46:08.680
Come on.

46:08.760 --> 46:11.040
(Rickie sobbing)

46:39.000 --> 46:41.680
(theme music playing)
