00:47.373 --> 00:50.299
(crickets chirping)

00:50.299 --> 00:51.132
- Boo!

00:51.132 --> 00:52.374
- [Man] Jesus...

00:52.374 --> 00:53.207
(laughing)

00:53.207 --> 00:56.040
Fucking Christ, Jacquie!

00:56.040 --> 00:57.623
- Is anyone around?

00:59.964 --> 01:01.424
- [Man] Let's just get
this over with, all right?

01:01.424 --> 01:03.618
- All right, you scared?

01:03.618 --> 01:05.650
- [Man] Yeah, we're
about to break into that

01:05.650 --> 01:07.809
fucking house where that bald, fat guy

01:07.809 --> 01:08.816
with the Jersey accent died.

01:08.816 --> 01:10.488
Yeah, I'm a little scared, all right?

01:10.488 --> 01:12.009
- All right, it's gonna be cool.

01:12.009 --> 01:12.842
All right.

01:12.842 --> 01:14.165
(sighing)

01:14.165 --> 01:15.559
I'm going in.

01:15.559 --> 01:16.615
- [Man] Okay, let's hurry up.

01:16.615 --> 01:17.448
- All right.

01:17.448 --> 01:18.698
Oh, flashlight?

01:21.758 --> 01:23.349
- [Man] It's somewhere on me.

01:23.349 --> 01:24.182
- Schmiddy?

01:24.182 --> 01:25.015
- [Schmiddy] What?

01:25.015 --> 01:26.495
- It's in your hand.

01:26.495 --> 01:27.796
- [Schmiddy] Oh shit, this flashlight.

01:27.796 --> 01:28.994
- Yeah.

01:28.994 --> 01:30.494
- [Schmiddy] Okay.

01:33.347 --> 01:34.810
Slow down! Slow down!

01:34.810 --> 01:35.643
- Sorry.

01:48.498 --> 01:49.845
- All right, let me help you.

01:49.845 --> 01:50.762
- I'm okay.

02:01.269 --> 02:03.769
(car zooming)

02:09.106 --> 02:09.939
All right?

02:09.939 --> 02:10.777
- Yeah.

02:10.777 --> 02:12.787
Just be careful, all right?

02:12.787 --> 02:13.620
- Don't even worry.

02:13.620 --> 02:15.870
(giggling)

02:37.352 --> 02:38.852
It's so calm here.

02:40.092 --> 02:41.486
Considering every that happened,

02:41.486 --> 02:42.903
it's kinda weird.

02:49.238 --> 02:50.887
- [Schmiddy] Where is she going?

02:50.887 --> 02:51.908
Jacquie!

02:51.908 --> 02:53.046
- What?

02:53.046 --> 02:55.333
Shut up, Schmiddy!

02:55.333 --> 02:57.957
- [Schmiddy] Okay, shutting up.

02:57.957 --> 02:59.223
- [Jacquie] I feel like
I should be sensing

02:59.223 --> 03:00.890
something right now.

03:01.997 --> 03:04.914
(sandals clapping)

03:05.817 --> 03:06.817
What's this?

03:10.194 --> 03:11.027
Hello?

03:12.725 --> 03:13.558
Matt?

03:15.569 --> 03:16.402
Rachel?

03:24.126 --> 03:24.959
Ben?

03:26.785 --> 03:27.618
Hmm.

03:31.925 --> 03:32.758
Ah!

03:33.678 --> 03:34.845
There you are.

03:37.579 --> 03:38.412
All right.

03:39.576 --> 03:42.576
(crickets chirping)

03:44.835 --> 03:46.472
- [Schmiddy] Did you get it?

03:46.472 --> 03:47.656
- Yeah.

03:47.656 --> 03:49.038
Better get out of here.

03:49.038 --> 03:50.756
- [Schmiddy] Any activity in there?

03:50.756 --> 03:51.589
- No.

03:51.589 --> 03:53.089
- [Schmiddy] Okay.

03:58.451 --> 04:02.584
- All right, let's check out this footage.

04:02.584 --> 04:04.615
- [Jacquie] I think you're gonna
like what you're gonna see.

04:04.615 --> 04:06.194
- I really like that chair.

04:06.194 --> 04:07.297
(Jacquie chuckling)

04:07.297 --> 04:08.791
Kinda feel like I've
seen this already though.

04:08.791 --> 04:09.975
- You haven't seen this one.

04:09.975 --> 04:10.808
- Just wait.

04:10.808 --> 04:11.647
- All right, impress me.

04:11.647 --> 04:12.959
Let me see.

04:12.959 --> 04:15.209
(rustling)

04:16.709 --> 04:17.892
I hear something.

04:17.892 --> 04:19.529
- Mhmm.

04:19.529 --> 04:21.779
(rustling)

04:22.677 --> 04:25.594
- [David] Where's that coming from?

04:26.485 --> 04:27.480
(chain clinking)

04:27.480 --> 04:29.396
- [Schmiddy] There he is.

04:29.396 --> 04:30.626
- No way.

04:30.626 --> 04:31.459
- Yeah.

04:31.459 --> 04:32.380
Yeah.

04:32.380 --> 04:33.773
- Tom Fuckin' Riley.

04:33.773 --> 04:35.607
- What the hell?

04:35.607 --> 04:38.440
(chains clinking)

04:40.985 --> 04:43.901
(groaning)

04:43.901 --> 04:46.734
(heavy breathing)

05:11.149 --> 05:11.982
Okay.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.027
This is incredible.

05:15.027 --> 05:15.886
I mean,

05:15.886 --> 05:18.417
the cloud recorder was full.

05:18.417 --> 05:19.555
Is that what they told us?

05:19.555 --> 05:21.017
How did you get the footage?

05:21.017 --> 05:23.096
- Yeah, the cloud recorder was full.

05:23.096 --> 05:23.929
- Yeah.

05:23.929 --> 05:24.762
- However,

05:24.762 --> 05:28.111
I remember this guy telling the
previous owners of the house

05:28.111 --> 05:30.364
that there's onboard memory

05:30.364 --> 05:32.360
in the event of a power outage.

05:32.360 --> 05:33.823
So the camera keeps recording.

05:33.823 --> 05:34.656
- Yeah?

05:34.656 --> 05:38.363
- So, I broke into the house
and I stole that camera.

05:38.363 --> 05:39.196
- Nice.

05:39.196 --> 05:40.360
Of course, as your boss,

05:40.360 --> 05:42.600
I can not condone you
breaking and entering.

05:42.600 --> 05:43.433
- Yeah.

05:43.433 --> 05:44.568
- So, good job.

05:44.568 --> 05:47.587
Schmiddy, cut out the part
where she breaks and enters.

05:47.587 --> 05:48.420
- Fuck no.

05:48.420 --> 05:50.617
If I'm breaking the law, I'm
getting street cred for it.

05:50.617 --> 05:52.529
- Plus, I don't think
anyone's going to care.

05:52.529 --> 05:54.282
- All right, sounds good.

05:54.282 --> 05:56.427
So, we know he's alive.

05:56.427 --> 05:57.449
- Mhmm.

05:57.449 --> 05:59.167
- The big question is,

05:59.167 --> 06:00.839
where the hell is he?

06:00.839 --> 06:01.861
- Ah!

06:01.861 --> 06:02.720
I have more.

06:02.720 --> 06:03.553
- She has more.

06:03.553 --> 06:04.516
- Yeah.

06:04.516 --> 06:05.766
Check this out.

06:09.323 --> 06:10.507
- How you doing, Tom?

06:10.507 --> 06:11.340
- Tom?

06:11.340 --> 06:12.507
Not Tom Riley.

06:15.244 --> 06:17.903
(door squealing)

06:17.903 --> 06:19.447
Eagle Mart.

06:19.447 --> 06:20.793
I know that place.

06:20.793 --> 06:21.626
- Mhmm.

06:25.124 --> 06:27.874
(door squealing)

06:37.450 --> 06:38.283
- Okay?

06:38.283 --> 06:39.116
- Okay.

06:39.116 --> 06:39.949
- All right.

06:39.949 --> 06:40.949
- Thank you.

06:42.532 --> 06:43.365
- [Jacquie] Okay,

06:43.365 --> 06:48.128
so I hacked in to all the
non-password protected cameras,

06:48.128 --> 06:50.647
surrounded cameras with
in a five mile radius,

06:50.647 --> 06:51.480
(beeping)

06:51.480 --> 06:54.119
and for facial recognition.

06:54.119 --> 06:55.175
I found this.

06:55.175 --> 06:56.151
- [David] No way.

06:56.151 --> 06:57.253
- [Jacquie] Yeah way.

06:57.253 --> 06:58.519
(beeping)

06:58.519 --> 06:59.901
- [Schmiddy] He got fat.

06:59.901 --> 07:01.131
- [Jacquie] Schmiddy, shut up.

07:01.131 --> 07:02.432
- The goatee helps.

07:02.432 --> 07:04.510
Jacquie, you're incredible.

07:04.510 --> 07:05.822
It's Tom!

07:05.822 --> 07:06.655
Tom Riley!

07:08.271 --> 07:09.104
Okay,

07:09.104 --> 07:11.452
so we know he's alive.

07:11.452 --> 07:12.718
- Mhmm.

07:12.718 --> 07:14.599
- The big question us, where is he?

07:14.599 --> 07:15.432
- Okay,

07:15.432 --> 07:19.173
so, we talked to the guy who
runs that convenience store.

07:19.173 --> 07:20.006
Pete.

07:20.006 --> 07:22.470
And he told us that Tom comes in

07:22.470 --> 07:25.242
about three times a week,

07:25.242 --> 07:27.045
first thing in the morning,

07:27.045 --> 07:30.492
so Schmiddy and I set up
camp in the parking lot

07:30.492 --> 07:32.292
and waited for him.

07:32.292 --> 07:33.929
- And?

07:33.929 --> 07:35.403
- David,

07:35.403 --> 07:36.785
we got him.

07:36.785 --> 07:37.618
- No way.

07:39.722 --> 07:40.555
Now what?

07:44.714 --> 07:48.221
I'm here at the house
on Steelmanville Road,

07:48.221 --> 07:51.286
waiting for Jacquie to arrive

07:51.286 --> 07:52.536
with Tom Riley.

07:55.790 --> 07:58.472
It's actually a really nice
house when you think about it.

07:58.472 --> 08:00.028
Set out in the woods.

08:00.028 --> 08:01.096
Peaceful.

08:01.096 --> 08:01.929
Quiet.

08:03.267 --> 08:05.670
Kind of a shame about what happened here.

08:05.670 --> 08:07.253
Here they come now.

08:33.405 --> 08:35.572
- [Tom] Where's the money?

08:37.701 --> 08:39.988
- [David] What? What's wrong?

08:39.988 --> 08:41.270
- He wants to know where the money is.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.164
- I have the money.

08:42.164 --> 08:43.221
I can give him the money.

08:43.221 --> 08:44.695
- Give me the money, Dave.

08:44.695 --> 08:45.528
- I can give him.

08:45.528 --> 08:46.361
- No.

08:46.361 --> 08:47.194
Trust me.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.433
- Fine. Take the money.

08:48.433 --> 08:49.443
- He trusts me.

08:49.443 --> 08:51.693
So just let me handle this.

08:57.196 --> 08:58.237
Can you just give him space?

08:58.237 --> 08:59.487
Give him space.

09:09.093 --> 09:10.648
- Mr. Riley, it's a pleasure to meet you!

09:10.648 --> 09:12.854
- Oh my God, Jesus Christ, Dave!

09:12.854 --> 09:13.687
Okay?

09:13.687 --> 09:15.745
We have a PTSD situation here.

09:15.745 --> 09:17.464
- Hey, it's okay.

09:17.464 --> 09:18.297
I paid him.

09:18.297 --> 09:19.130
- My God.

09:20.482 --> 09:21.315
Okay.

09:23.466 --> 09:24.716
It's okay, Tom.

09:26.577 --> 09:27.910
You can do this.

09:30.409 --> 09:33.076
Schmiddy, can you shut the door?

09:36.446 --> 09:38.292
(car beeping)

09:38.292 --> 09:40.045
- No! No! No! No!

09:40.045 --> 09:41.078
- Tom!

09:41.078 --> 09:42.053
- [David] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

09:42.053 --> 09:44.097
Where's my money?!

09:44.097 --> 09:45.931
- Sorry about scarring you back there.

09:45.931 --> 09:47.034
I didn't mean to.

09:47.034 --> 09:48.137
- It's okay.

09:48.137 --> 09:50.297
I'm just a little freaked
out being back here,

09:50.297 --> 09:51.237
that's all.

09:51.237 --> 09:54.790
- [Jacquie] You know, I
admire your courage, Tom.

09:54.790 --> 09:56.171
- Courage?

09:56.171 --> 09:57.773
That's what you're calling this? Courage?

09:57.773 --> 09:58.911
- [Jacquie] Yeah.

09:58.911 --> 10:01.442
I'm surprised you agreed
to do this, frankly.

10:01.442 --> 10:03.532
- I'm doing this for one reason

10:03.532 --> 10:05.366
and one reason only.

10:05.366 --> 10:06.922
- [Schmiddy] To tell you story, right?

10:06.922 --> 10:07.816
- Fuck no.

10:07.816 --> 10:10.428
I'm doing this because
you guys are paying me.

10:10.428 --> 10:13.052
- [Jacquie] Would you be
willing to go into the house?

10:13.052 --> 10:14.945
You know, just to give us a tour

10:14.945 --> 10:18.091
and tell us about your experiences.

10:18.091 --> 10:20.413
- I don't know about that.

10:20.413 --> 10:23.254
- [Jacquie] I mean, we'd
be with you the whole time.

10:23.254 --> 10:24.113
You know?

10:24.113 --> 10:26.780
Nothings going to happen to you.

10:29.558 --> 10:31.590
What would it take?

10:31.590 --> 10:32.423
More money?

10:32.423 --> 10:33.506
- [David] Yo, Jacquie!

10:33.506 --> 10:34.548
- [Jacquie] Look, David,

10:34.548 --> 10:37.856
this is a once in a lifetime
opportunity for all of us.

10:37.856 --> 10:40.585
- [David] We don't even have
permission to go inside there.

10:40.585 --> 10:42.338
- [Jacquie] So get permission.

10:42.338 --> 10:44.010
You're the director.

10:44.010 --> 10:46.343
It says so on your dumb hat.

10:47.330 --> 10:49.080
How much do you want?

10:50.140 --> 10:51.723
- How much you got?

10:55.747 --> 10:57.953
- All right, here's the situation.

10:57.953 --> 10:59.788
For a fee, a big fee,

10:59.788 --> 11:01.788
we can get in the house.

11:02.690 --> 11:04.490
But we better make sure

11:04.490 --> 11:06.243
whatever we get in there is good

11:06.243 --> 11:07.671
because it's costing a fortune.

11:07.671 --> 11:10.872
- David, we're gonna make this
all back after we're done.

11:10.872 --> 11:13.078
I mean, taking him inside the house,

11:13.078 --> 11:15.597
where all that shit happened,
is going to be gold.

11:15.597 --> 11:17.173
Plus, I'm going to go in there and stir up

11:17.173 --> 11:18.973
whatever stuff is in there

11:18.973 --> 11:21.086
and then we're gonna capture it all.

11:21.086 --> 11:23.547
We're gonna be making
a fortune off of this.

11:23.547 --> 11:24.789
- Okay.

11:24.789 --> 11:26.121
We better, you better,

11:26.121 --> 11:28.165
because between the gold I'm giving him

11:28.165 --> 11:29.465
and the gold I'm giving them,

11:29.465 --> 11:30.893
we're way over budget all ready

11:30.893 --> 11:32.170
and we haven't even started.

11:32.170 --> 11:33.633
- [Schmiddy] We're gonna
need power in there.

11:33.633 --> 11:35.595
- According to the bank, power's on.

11:35.595 --> 11:36.861
- [Schmiddy] All right, cool.

11:36.861 --> 11:38.776
- So when can we go in?

11:38.776 --> 11:40.158
- Here's the thing.

11:40.158 --> 11:43.757
The auction is at nine tomorrow morning.

11:43.757 --> 11:45.835
We have to do this tonight.

11:45.835 --> 11:46.729
- Okay, fine.

11:46.729 --> 11:49.341
Did you get the stuff he wanted?

11:49.341 --> 11:52.035
Great, let's go get him.

11:52.035 --> 11:52.868
Tom?

12:01.787 --> 12:02.620
Tom?

12:02.620 --> 12:03.622
- Jesus Christ!

12:03.622 --> 12:05.990
What're you trying to do,
give me a heart attack?

12:05.990 --> 12:06.965
- I'm sorry.

12:06.965 --> 12:08.382
We can go in now.

12:12.956 --> 12:14.431
Look,

12:14.431 --> 12:17.411
I mean, when's the last time
you had a shower, right?

12:17.411 --> 12:19.280
- What're you trying to say, I stink?

12:19.280 --> 12:20.113
- No, no.

12:20.113 --> 12:25.074
I'm just saying you've been
living in a tent in the woods.

12:25.074 --> 12:29.241
- Look, I got you a razor,
clean clothes and soap.

12:32.716 --> 12:34.387
- Is something wrong?

12:34.387 --> 12:35.606
- Walmart?

12:35.606 --> 12:37.197
- Hey, it was on the way.

12:37.197 --> 12:39.194
- I was hoping for JC Penny.

12:39.194 --> 12:40.796
- Look, when we're done with this,

12:40.796 --> 12:43.687
I will buy you a JC Penny.

12:43.687 --> 12:44.999
- And Abba?

12:44.999 --> 12:46.832
Abba on your playlist?

12:47.890 --> 12:49.399
- [Schmiddy] That's my playlist.

12:49.399 --> 12:51.721
- The Mamma Mia soundtrack, Sally?

12:51.721 --> 12:52.905
- Okay, listen,

12:52.905 --> 12:55.401
you can just keep this, okay?

12:55.401 --> 12:57.851
And you can put whatever
music you want on it.

12:57.851 --> 13:00.429
- [Schmiddy] What's wrong with Abba?

13:00.429 --> 13:03.935
- You know, I don't exactly
have access to iTunes.

13:03.935 --> 13:05.967
- Okay, I'll give you an iTunes gift card

13:05.967 --> 13:08.416
and you can do it at the library.

13:08.416 --> 13:09.339
- All right.

13:09.339 --> 13:10.172
- Okay?

13:13.310 --> 13:15.968
- [Schmiddy] I'm gonna set
up a camera up over here.

13:15.968 --> 13:17.628
- Yeah, which camera are you using?

13:17.628 --> 13:19.393
- [Schmiddy] I was gonna
us a Go Pro over here

13:19.393 --> 13:21.425
to put a motion sensor on.

13:21.425 --> 13:22.574
- Right, good idea.

13:22.574 --> 13:25.140
- [Schmiddy] Capture
anything that happens.

13:25.140 --> 13:25.973
- Come on.

13:28.774 --> 13:30.941
- [David] You can do this.

13:41.545 --> 13:42.545
- It's okay.

13:54.420 --> 13:55.686
You ready?

13:55.686 --> 13:56.519
- No.

14:00.167 --> 14:02.652
- [David] Trust me, she
knows what she's doing.

14:02.652 --> 14:04.324
She's the best in the business.

14:04.324 --> 14:05.589
- Oh, that's comforting.

14:05.589 --> 14:07.714
This demon beats the shit
out of me in bed here

14:07.714 --> 14:10.976
and Miss 95-pounder, here,
is going to defend me.

14:10.976 --> 14:12.335
- 105.

14:12.335 --> 14:13.229
- Oh, that's good to know.

14:13.229 --> 14:15.469
That extra 10 pounds.

14:15.469 --> 14:17.469
- It makes a difference.

14:20.531 --> 14:22.818
- This is fucking nuts.

14:22.818 --> 14:24.862
- [David] Tom Riley going into the house

14:24.862 --> 14:26.779
on Steelmanville Road.

14:30.446 --> 14:31.613
- Okay, ready?

14:33.790 --> 14:35.540
- [David] And action.

14:36.890 --> 14:39.049
- We're here in the house.

14:39.049 --> 14:40.558
Yes, that house,

14:40.558 --> 14:42.637
on Steelmanville Road.

14:42.637 --> 14:44.309
The events that occurred here

14:44.309 --> 14:46.561
are well documented in two previous films

14:46.561 --> 14:48.767
that showed what happened
to Matt and Rachel Harris

14:48.767 --> 14:51.205
and then to Tom Riley.

14:51.205 --> 14:53.538
It's why we believe that
there are no survivors,

14:53.538 --> 14:56.882
however, we have a surprise for you.

14:56.882 --> 14:58.345
I'm Jacquie Baker,

14:58.345 --> 15:00.342
paranormal investigator.

15:00.342 --> 15:02.594
My crew and I are putting
together this documentary

15:02.594 --> 15:05.334
to show that what goes bump in the night

15:05.334 --> 15:08.834
doesn't always have a logical explanation.

15:09.816 --> 15:10.649
- [David] Cut.

15:10.649 --> 15:11.615
That was great.

15:11.615 --> 15:13.333
- Do I need to to it again?

15:13.333 --> 15:14.390
- [David] Looked perfect to me.

15:14.390 --> 15:15.284
- Okay, great.

15:15.284 --> 15:16.190
Follow me.

15:16.190 --> 15:17.490
- [David] What's that noise?

15:17.490 --> 15:18.999
- [Schmiddy] He turned on the shower.

15:18.999 --> 15:20.427
- [David] Is that gonna mess up the audio?

15:20.427 --> 15:22.308
- [Schmiddy] We have to film
this now while he's up there.

15:22.308 --> 15:23.141
- Okay.

15:25.245 --> 15:28.032
This is where the knife was
holding up the voodoo dolls.

15:28.032 --> 15:29.199
Remember that?

15:31.863 --> 15:34.363
And here is the Lord's Prayer.

15:36.519 --> 15:38.028
- [David] What the hell are you doing?

15:38.028 --> 15:39.537
- In order to contact the spirits

15:39.537 --> 15:41.662
we have to remove these
religious artifacts.

15:41.662 --> 15:44.274
They create a spiritual barrier.

15:44.274 --> 15:46.317
- What about the big-ass bible over here?

15:46.317 --> 15:47.150
- Yeah.

15:51.182 --> 15:52.564
Okay, David,

15:52.564 --> 15:55.872
can you take these out to the car?

15:55.872 --> 15:57.591
- Shit, the shower stopped running.

15:57.591 --> 15:58.647
- Oh, okay.

15:58.647 --> 15:59.669
Quick, get into position.

15:59.669 --> 16:01.387
I have to get this done
before he comes down.

16:01.387 --> 16:02.220
Okay?

16:11.546 --> 16:12.879
Welcome spirits,

16:13.752 --> 16:15.419
come into your home.

16:16.736 --> 16:19.557
- Holy shit, did you just feel that?

16:19.557 --> 16:20.660
- Yeah.

16:20.660 --> 16:22.982
The temperature's dropping.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.106
(door squealing)

16:25.106 --> 16:27.150
Welcome spirits.

16:27.150 --> 16:28.817
Come into your home.

16:31.306 --> 16:32.699
Oh my God.

16:32.699 --> 16:33.532
- Fuck.

16:34.661 --> 16:35.683
- Oh my God.

16:35.683 --> 16:37.599
Something just totally blew past me.

16:37.599 --> 16:38.539
Did you get that?

16:38.539 --> 16:39.851
- [Schmiddy] Yeah, I got it.

16:39.851 --> 16:42.138
- Is the special filter on?

16:42.138 --> 16:43.404
- [Schmiddy] No.

16:43.404 --> 16:44.913
- Goddamn it, Schmiddy, why not?

16:44.913 --> 16:46.538
- [Schmiddy] It throws
off the white balance.

16:46.538 --> 16:48.384
- Who gives a fuck about white balance?

16:48.384 --> 16:50.463
- [Schmiddy] My professors
at film university.

16:50.463 --> 16:53.156
- Okay, well something just passed by me.

16:53.156 --> 16:54.422
Holy shit.

16:54.422 --> 16:56.418
- [Schmiddy] Jesus Christ.

16:56.418 --> 16:57.918
Holy fucking shit.

17:08.586 --> 17:09.419
- What?

17:09.419 --> 17:11.002
Where's the camera?

17:11.848 --> 17:12.742
- Oh shit.

17:12.742 --> 17:14.344
- Schmiddy, you have to
have it at all times.

17:14.344 --> 17:16.844
- [Schmiddy] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:19.058 --> 17:20.068
- Oh wait, here he comes.

17:20.068 --> 17:21.055
Get back over there.

17:21.055 --> 17:23.296
- [Schmiddy] Right, got it.

17:23.296 --> 17:26.378
(footsteps stomping)

17:30.111 --> 17:31.585
- Well.

17:31.585 --> 17:33.094
- Hey.

17:33.094 --> 17:35.254
- I do feel better.

17:35.254 --> 17:36.394
Kinda quite, isn't it?

17:36.394 --> 17:37.227
- Yeah, yeah.

17:37.227 --> 17:38.060
- Feeling better?

17:38.060 --> 17:40.550
- Oh my God, David, what
the hell is wrong with you?

17:40.550 --> 17:41.560
- I'm sorry.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.393
- Jesus.

17:42.393 --> 17:44.788
- This fucking guy.

17:44.788 --> 17:46.007
- [Jacquie] Oh my God, sorry.

17:46.007 --> 17:47.340
- Fucking pussy.

17:48.492 --> 17:49.325
- My God.

17:52.903 --> 17:54.169
- What is with him?

17:54.169 --> 17:56.282
His sneaking up and grabbing bullshit?

17:56.282 --> 17:57.919
- I know, he has a thing with boundaries.

17:57.919 --> 17:59.718
- Does he know what I went through here?

17:59.718 --> 18:01.065
- I know. I know.

18:01.065 --> 18:04.452
- [Schmiddy] You fought a monster.

18:04.452 --> 18:06.530
- I don't like him either.

18:06.530 --> 18:07.697
- Nobody does.

18:10.536 --> 18:13.119
- [David] Man, dude is on edge.

18:14.448 --> 18:18.198
- [Schmiddy] Jacquie was
doing some spooky shit.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.369
She conjured something up.

18:20.369 --> 18:21.914
- [David] No way, did you get it on tape?

18:21.914 --> 18:22.747
- [Schmiddy] Yeah.

18:22.747 --> 18:24.247
You should see the white
balance, it's beautiful.

18:24.247 --> 18:25.080
- [David] Awesome!

18:25.080 --> 18:26.407
You are the king of white balance.

18:26.407 --> 18:28.334
- [Schmiddy] Thanks.

18:28.334 --> 18:29.797
- Do you smell that?

18:29.797 --> 18:31.503
What is that?

18:31.503 --> 18:33.918
- [Schmiddy] I think he shit himself.

18:33.918 --> 18:36.403
- Dude, I didn't shit myself.

18:36.403 --> 18:37.587
That's the smell.

18:37.587 --> 18:39.712
Whenever stuff would start
happening around here,

18:39.712 --> 18:41.999
that's the smell I would smell.

18:41.999 --> 18:44.901
You know what, I'm starting to
think this isn't a good idea.

18:44.901 --> 18:45.784
- No, no, no, no.

18:45.784 --> 18:46.643
Tome, listen,

18:46.643 --> 18:49.058
I am an experienced medium, okay?

18:49.058 --> 18:50.439
I'm a professional.

18:50.439 --> 18:53.458
Nothing is gonna happen to you, okay?

18:53.458 --> 18:55.048
- Nothing's gonna happen to me?

18:55.048 --> 18:55.881
- Yeah.

18:55.881 --> 18:58.833
- You have no idea how
quickly this can escalate.

18:58.833 --> 19:00.261
You're gonna be protecting me?

19:00.261 --> 19:02.665
Who's gonna be protecting you?

19:02.665 --> 19:05.207
- Listen, nothing is gonna hurt you, okay?
http://worldmkv.com/

19:05.207 --> 19:06.473
Here.

19:06.473 --> 19:07.657
Just relax, all right?

19:07.657 --> 19:08.574
I got this.

19:10.304 --> 19:11.732
You're gonna be fine.

19:11.732 --> 19:13.659
We're all gonna be fine.

19:13.659 --> 19:15.041
- What do you think about the time?

19:15.041 --> 19:16.063
- I don't know.

19:16.063 --> 19:17.502
There's a lot I kinda wanna get to.

19:17.502 --> 19:19.209
- Let's just make it snappy

19:19.209 --> 19:22.100
because we're out of here
at nine in the morning.

19:22.100 --> 19:25.409
Just get some scary
stuff, get the guy to talk

19:25.409 --> 19:26.604
and we're gone.

19:26.604 --> 19:27.498
- [Jacquie] Yeah.

19:27.498 --> 19:28.926
- [David] All right then.

19:28.926 --> 19:31.376
- [Jacquie] I think it's going well.

19:31.376 --> 19:33.094
- [David] I think it's going well too.

19:33.094 --> 19:35.416
He's a little, you know.

19:35.416 --> 19:36.810
- [Jacquie] Okay.

19:36.810 --> 19:39.085
(Jacquie and David whispering)

19:39.085 --> 19:39.944
- [David] He can hear us?

19:39.944 --> 19:40.777
- [Jacquie] Yeah.

19:40.777 --> 19:41.895
- [David] He's not def.

19:41.895 --> 19:42.728
- [Jacquie] No, David.

19:42.728 --> 19:45.563
- [David] He's a little...

19:45.563 --> 19:46.864
- [Jacquie] I know.

19:46.864 --> 19:48.222
He's gone through a lot, okay?

19:48.222 --> 19:49.244
- [David] I forgot about that

19:49.244 --> 19:51.844
the whole ghost thing.

19:51.844 --> 19:53.064
That's why we're here.

19:53.064 --> 19:54.492
- [Jacquie] It's PTSD, David.

19:54.492 --> 19:55.920
- [David] Yeah, whatever.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.198
- [Jacquie] Anyway, I don't know.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.574
I think we're pretty all right.

19:59.574 --> 20:01.211
- [David] Okay.

20:01.211 --> 20:03.254
- We gonna do this?

20:03.254 --> 20:04.087
- [David] What?

20:04.087 --> 20:04.926
- Are we gonna do this?

20:04.926 --> 20:06.551
- [David] Oh yeah, Tom Riley.

20:06.551 --> 20:08.270
Hey, how's it going?

20:08.270 --> 20:09.129
- What is with him?

20:09.129 --> 20:10.754
How many problems are here?

20:10.754 --> 20:12.925
- I know, I know.

20:12.925 --> 20:15.526
I'm gonna go talk to Tom.

20:15.526 --> 20:16.359
- Ooo.

20:17.697 --> 20:19.206
Man,

20:19.206 --> 20:21.168
if I had hair on the back of my neck,

20:21.168 --> 20:23.571
it would be standing up right now.

20:23.571 --> 20:25.743
- So Tom, what's gonna happen now

20:25.743 --> 20:28.146
is I'm going to stand in front of you,

20:28.146 --> 20:30.337
we're gonna turn the camera on, okay?

20:30.337 --> 20:32.473
I've already told the audience

20:32.473 --> 20:35.202
that I have a surprise for them.

20:35.202 --> 20:37.291
So I'm going to step to the side

20:37.291 --> 20:38.998
and you're going to be sitting there

20:38.998 --> 20:41.123
and that's going to be the big reveal.

20:41.123 --> 20:42.841
That you survived.

20:42.841 --> 20:44.350
- People really have that must interest

20:44.350 --> 20:46.266
in the fact that I'm alive?

20:46.266 --> 20:49.215
- You would be very surprised, yeah.

20:49.215 --> 20:50.643
Anyway, so I'm gonna do that

20:50.643 --> 20:51.943
and then after that

20:51.943 --> 20:53.287
I'm just gonna ask you some questions.

20:53.287 --> 20:55.214
It's gonna be pretty
straight forward, okay?

20:55.214 --> 20:56.047
- Yep.

20:56.047 --> 20:57.048
- Are you ready?

20:57.048 --> 20:58.117
- Yeah, let's go.

20:58.117 --> 20:59.301
- Okay, you guys good?

20:59.301 --> 21:01.039
- [Schmiddy] Yep, ready to go.

21:01.039 --> 21:01.933
- Okay.

21:01.933 --> 21:02.766
Am I okay?

21:06.333 --> 21:07.166
Okay.

21:08.946 --> 21:10.095
Okay.

21:10.095 --> 21:11.595
- [Schmiddy] Okay.

21:12.997 --> 21:14.747
- [David] And action.

21:16.016 --> 21:17.247
- Okay, everyone,

21:17.247 --> 21:19.406
I told you we had a surprise.

21:19.406 --> 21:21.239
Prepare to be shocked.

21:26.419 --> 21:27.252
Holy shit.

21:28.543 --> 21:30.424
My God, what happened?

21:30.424 --> 21:32.711
- [David] We trip something?

21:32.711 --> 21:33.779
- [Schmiddy] No.

21:33.779 --> 21:35.076
- [David] Figure it out,
we have to be out of here

21:35.076 --> 21:36.008
at nine in the morning.

21:36.008 --> 21:38.022
I want to get this thing.

21:38.022 --> 21:39.610
- Okay, keep the camera rolling.

21:39.610 --> 21:40.875
- [Schmiddy] It's rolling.

21:40.875 --> 21:42.303
- [David] But wait!

21:42.303 --> 21:43.685
What happened to Tom?

21:43.685 --> 21:46.704
(shushing)

21:46.704 --> 21:48.259
- Tom?

21:48.259 --> 21:49.092
- Tom?

21:50.825 --> 21:52.575
- Tom, where are you?

21:53.632 --> 21:54.897
- Tom?

21:54.897 --> 21:56.314
- Get the camera.

21:59.924 --> 22:01.109
Hello?

22:01.109 --> 22:01.942
- Tom?

22:08.051 --> 22:08.910
- [Jacquie] Tom?

22:08.910 --> 22:10.629
- [David] Tom!

22:10.629 --> 22:11.462
Let's go.

22:21.658 --> 22:22.599
- Tom, open the door!

22:22.599 --> 22:25.048
(Tom screaming)

22:25.048 --> 22:26.349
Tom!

22:26.349 --> 22:27.870
- Let me try!

22:27.870 --> 22:30.888
(thudding)

22:30.888 --> 22:31.945
It's not opening.

22:31.945 --> 22:33.326
- Hey, up here.

22:33.326 --> 22:34.603
- [David] Oh, what?

22:34.603 --> 22:36.844
- What're you guys doing down there?

22:36.844 --> 22:38.969
- [Jacquie] Oh my God, what?

22:38.969 --> 22:40.350
- [David] Looking for you.

22:40.350 --> 22:42.103
- I've been up here.

22:42.103 --> 22:44.103
Come on up out of there.

22:46.550 --> 22:49.633
(footsteps stomping)

22:55.501 --> 22:57.334
- [David] Is that you?

22:58.346 --> 23:00.354
- I went the bathroom.

23:00.354 --> 23:03.001
The lights went out and
I heard you guys yelling.

23:03.001 --> 23:05.161
What were you doing down there?

23:05.161 --> 23:07.204
- We saw you down there.

23:07.204 --> 23:08.145
- [Schmiddy] You were down there.

23:08.145 --> 23:11.569
- Something manifested as you down there.

23:11.569 --> 23:12.638
I guess to fool us.

23:12.638 --> 23:13.984
We thought they had you.

23:13.984 --> 23:16.748
- I never went down there.

23:16.748 --> 23:18.385
- You saw it.

23:18.385 --> 23:19.218
- Yeah.

23:19.218 --> 23:20.135
- I saw it.

23:21.145 --> 23:22.294
Okay.

23:22.294 --> 23:23.627
- It's starting.

23:24.895 --> 23:26.903
- [Jacquie] Okay, I need a minute.

23:26.903 --> 23:28.203
- [David] Okay.

23:28.203 --> 23:29.260
- Tom,

23:29.260 --> 23:33.579
in your own words, tell
me what happened here.

23:33.579 --> 23:35.169
- I lost my fucking money.

23:35.169 --> 23:36.002
- Okay.

23:36.002 --> 23:37.538
- [David] Cut.

23:37.538 --> 23:38.641
- What?

23:38.641 --> 23:39.558
- Language.

23:41.416 --> 23:43.331
- You can't bleep that out?

23:43.331 --> 23:45.247
- No, you can't say the F-word.

23:45.247 --> 23:48.788
- Okay look, Tom, it's
not just the language.

23:48.788 --> 23:50.994
We can bleep that out.

23:50.994 --> 23:52.244
We want to hear

23:53.200 --> 23:55.812
what you experienced here.

23:55.812 --> 23:57.762
- I experienced bankruptcy.

23:57.762 --> 23:59.678
- Okay and we will get to that.

23:59.678 --> 24:03.184
- Yeah, we wanna hear what
you experienced in the house.

24:03.184 --> 24:04.659
- With the spooky stuff.

24:04.659 --> 24:06.006
The ghost and ghouls and things.

24:06.006 --> 24:07.643
- The furniture moving.

24:07.643 --> 24:09.187
You being drugged down the stairs,

24:09.187 --> 24:10.092
nearly dying.

24:10.092 --> 24:11.068
- Okay, okay.

24:11.068 --> 24:12.124
I got it.

24:12.124 --> 24:13.517
- Okay, do you wanna take it from the top?

24:13.517 --> 24:15.012
- [David] Let's take it from the top.

24:15.012 --> 24:15.845
- Okay.

24:17.415 --> 24:18.437
(David clearing troat)

24:18.437 --> 24:19.737
- [David] Schmiddy, you still rolling?

24:19.737 --> 24:20.570
- [Schmiddy] Fuck yeah.

24:20.570 --> 24:21.630
- [David] All right.

24:21.630 --> 24:22.547
And action.

24:24.114 --> 24:26.239
- Tom, in your own words,

24:26.239 --> 24:28.189
tell me what happened.

24:28.189 --> 24:31.173
- Well I bought this house at share sale

24:31.173 --> 24:34.308
and I thought I was getting a great deal.

24:34.308 --> 24:36.722
- Did you know about
the history of the home?

24:36.722 --> 24:37.555
- No.

24:37.555 --> 24:39.207
They don't disclose anything to you.

24:39.207 --> 24:41.575
In fact, you're not
even allowed to inspect

24:41.575 --> 24:44.629
the inside of a home
before you make a bid.

24:44.629 --> 24:46.301
I didn't know if my bid was gonna

24:46.301 --> 24:48.263
come in even close to the highest,

24:48.263 --> 24:50.097
but apparently it was the highest

24:50.097 --> 24:52.384
because I won the bid.

24:52.384 --> 24:55.240
And my goal was to get in here,

24:55.240 --> 24:59.571
make any repairs the home
needed and then flip it.

24:59.571 --> 25:02.055
- You said they didn't disclose
the history of the home

25:02.055 --> 25:03.483
to you before you moved in?

25:03.483 --> 25:04.459
- No.

25:04.459 --> 25:07.071
When I got in here and shit started--

25:07.071 --> 25:09.358
- That's okay, we'll take it from the top.

25:09.358 --> 25:10.299
- Sorry.

25:10.299 --> 25:11.970
- It's all right.

25:11.970 --> 25:12.803
Okay,

25:12.803 --> 25:15.407
you said they didn't disclose
the history of the house.

25:15.407 --> 25:19.029
- No, when I got in here
and stuff started moving,

25:19.029 --> 25:22.059
I was trying to figure
out what was going on.

25:22.059 --> 25:24.707
One of the things I
did was I hopped online

25:24.707 --> 25:28.097
and I researched the previous owners

25:28.097 --> 25:30.268
and that's when I found out

25:30.268 --> 25:32.230
they were murdered here.

25:32.230 --> 25:33.480
- The Harrises.

25:34.389 --> 25:35.527
That was the couple who--

25:35.527 --> 25:36.711
- Oh, yes, yes, yes.

25:36.711 --> 25:38.662
- The Harrises, Matt and Rachel.

25:38.662 --> 25:39.495
- Yeah.

25:39.495 --> 25:42.702
- Up came the story about
what happened to them

25:42.702 --> 25:45.604
and it was actually a murder, suicide.

25:45.604 --> 25:47.230
She killed him

25:47.230 --> 25:50.132
and then she killed herself.

25:50.132 --> 25:51.595
- Yeah.

25:51.595 --> 25:53.105
- I always had heard

25:53.105 --> 25:55.386
that when there's been a
violent crime in a house,

25:55.386 --> 25:59.054
like a murder or a suicide
or something like that,

25:59.054 --> 26:00.842
that they had to disclose that.

26:00.842 --> 26:03.338
That's what I've always heard.

26:03.338 --> 26:06.078
But apparently, not in New Jersey.

26:06.078 --> 26:09.666
They don't have to disclose
it to you unless you ask.

26:09.666 --> 26:12.475
Who would think to ask
a question like that?

26:12.475 --> 26:14.275
So here we are.

26:14.275 --> 26:15.608
"Caveat emptor."

26:16.678 --> 26:18.919
- Let the buyer beware.

26:18.919 --> 26:19.929
- Yes.

26:19.929 --> 26:23.319
I know what "caveat emptor" means.

26:23.319 --> 26:25.641
- How did you react when you found out

26:25.641 --> 26:28.320
that there had been these murders here

26:28.320 --> 26:31.060
and nobody told you about them?

26:31.060 --> 26:32.244
- I was fucking pissed.

26:32.244 --> 26:33.994
- [David] Cut!

26:33.994 --> 26:35.492
Action.

26:35.492 --> 26:39.010
- Okay, tell me about
your first night here.

26:39.010 --> 26:41.088
- I came straight from settlement

26:41.088 --> 26:42.887
and when I got to the house I discovered

26:42.887 --> 26:44.884
that the electricity was off.

26:44.884 --> 26:48.031
So I thought, "Darn it,
it's Friday afternoon,

26:48.031 --> 26:50.399
"I'm gonna be without power all weekend."

26:50.399 --> 26:51.781
I called the electric company

26:51.781 --> 26:54.997
and fortunately they said
they could have it turned on

26:54.997 --> 26:57.040
in a couple hours.

26:57.040 --> 27:00.024
So I went out to get something
to eat while I was waiting

27:00.024 --> 27:01.986
and when I came home power was on.

27:01.986 --> 27:04.110
It was all lit up like this

27:04.110 --> 27:06.193
and it was very inviting.

27:08.104 --> 27:10.101
- So then what happened?

27:10.101 --> 27:13.236
- I got out of my car and
I came walking up here,

27:13.236 --> 27:16.545
figuring I would go in and
take a look at my house

27:16.545 --> 27:17.845
and when I walked up,

27:17.845 --> 27:20.132
that's when I saw that the fu...

27:20.132 --> 27:23.476
the freaking front door was open.

27:23.476 --> 27:24.625
I caught myself that time.

27:24.625 --> 27:26.413
- That was good, Tom, okay.

27:26.413 --> 27:27.841
Actually, can we cut here?

27:27.841 --> 27:28.747
- [David] Cut.

27:28.747 --> 27:31.022
- I'd like to reenact that.

27:31.022 --> 27:32.090
- [Schmiddy] Uh, Jacquie?

27:32.090 --> 27:32.923
- What?

27:35.768 --> 27:37.146
- [Schmiddy] Was that light on up there?

27:37.146 --> 27:38.737
- [Jacquie] What light?

27:38.737 --> 27:40.211
- [David] What's wrong?

27:40.211 --> 27:42.011
- [Jacquie] Was that light on up there?

27:42.011 --> 27:44.124
- [Schmiddy] Whoa, did you guys see that?

27:44.124 --> 27:45.598
- [Jacquie] Yeah.

27:45.598 --> 27:47.804
We know no one's in the house.

27:47.804 --> 27:49.232
- [David] But we just saw a shadow.

27:49.232 --> 27:50.219
- [Jacquie] Let's go up there.

27:50.219 --> 27:51.276
- [David] Oh yeah, let's go up there.

27:51.276 --> 27:52.109
- Yeah.

27:53.040 --> 27:53.873
All right.

28:05.161 --> 28:07.054
(thudding)

28:07.054 --> 28:07.887
Uh.

28:08.888 --> 28:09.721
The keys?

28:11.465 --> 28:12.731
- Inside.

28:12.731 --> 28:14.670
- All right, Schmiddy, can
you see if that window's open

28:14.670 --> 28:17.363
so I can just crawl in if I have to?

28:17.363 --> 28:19.116
- [Schmiddy] On it.

28:19.116 --> 28:20.283
- It's locked.

28:24.143 --> 28:24.976
- Wait.

28:26.918 --> 28:27.751
It's open.

28:32.061 --> 28:33.815
- You and I both tried that door.

28:33.815 --> 28:34.871
It was locked.

28:34.871 --> 28:36.020
- I know.

28:36.020 --> 28:38.261
- And he tried it and went in.

28:38.261 --> 28:41.233
- Yeah, I think that whatever's in there

28:41.233 --> 28:43.358
wants him to be in there.

28:43.358 --> 28:44.461
- Good.

28:44.461 --> 28:45.294
All right.

28:45.294 --> 28:46.884
- Yeah.

28:46.884 --> 28:47.801
- Let's go.

28:50.147 --> 28:51.575
Rolling.

28:51.575 --> 28:53.049
And--

28:53.049 --> 28:55.565
- Should I look at the
camera or look at you?

28:55.565 --> 28:56.668
- No, look at me.
http://worldmkv.com/

28:56.668 --> 28:57.501
- Okay.

28:57.501 --> 28:58.584
- And action.

29:00.209 --> 29:01.209
- Okay, Tom,

29:02.160 --> 29:03.832
lead the way.

29:03.832 --> 29:05.759
- As you saw from outside,

29:05.759 --> 29:07.477
the house is huge.

29:07.477 --> 29:09.560
Let me show you upstairs.

29:18.948 --> 29:21.115
Let me turn on the lights.

29:31.405 --> 29:32.238
(thudding)

29:32.238 --> 29:33.071
Jesus.

29:33.071 --> 29:34.166
- Shit.

29:34.166 --> 29:35.152
- Language.

29:35.152 --> 29:36.255
- Oops, sorry.

29:36.255 --> 29:37.338
You're right.

29:38.705 --> 29:40.133
(thudding)

29:40.133 --> 29:40.966
- Stop it.

29:49.932 --> 29:50.765
- Ready?

29:50.765 --> 29:52.672
- [Schmiddy] Yep

29:52.672 --> 29:54.645
- The temperature in
this room is much colder

29:54.645 --> 29:57.141
than it is in the rest of the house.

29:57.141 --> 29:57.974
- [David] We should check and see

29:57.974 --> 29:59.553
if someone left a window open.

29:59.553 --> 30:00.386
- [Schmiddy] It's warm outside,

30:00.386 --> 30:01.294
it wouldn't make a difference.

30:01.294 --> 30:02.557
- [David] Oh yeah, you're right.

30:02.557 --> 30:03.390
- I'll check.

30:03.390 --> 30:07.305
Tom, is there any cold air
coming out of that vent?

30:07.305 --> 30:08.138
It's not open.

30:08.138 --> 30:10.777
- No, but do you smell that?

30:10.777 --> 30:12.564
And before you say anything,

30:12.564 --> 30:14.314
I didn't shit myself.

30:15.664 --> 30:16.895
- It's sulfur,

30:16.895 --> 30:20.932
the smell associated with demonic forces.

30:20.932 --> 30:23.010
- Do you hear that?

30:23.010 --> 30:24.510
It's in the attic.

30:27.329 --> 30:29.579
(thudding)

30:31.497 --> 30:32.647
- That's right.

30:32.647 --> 30:36.443
The attic was where the
satanic alter was set up.

30:36.443 --> 30:38.510
You gonna be okay going in there?

30:38.510 --> 30:40.762
I know this must be
pretty terrifying for you.

30:40.762 --> 30:42.225
- You go first.

30:42.225 --> 30:43.058
- Okay.

30:51.408 --> 30:54.973
It's cold up here and
the smell is pretty bad,

30:54.973 --> 30:56.435
but I think it's safe.

30:56.435 --> 30:57.422
You can come on up.

30:57.422 --> 30:58.757
- That's comforting.

30:58.757 --> 31:00.424
You think it's safe.

31:05.398 --> 31:08.148
(metal clanking)

31:12.794 --> 31:14.141
- [Schmiddy] You wanna go up
and I'll hand you the camera?

31:14.141 --> 31:15.808
- Yeah, sounds good.

31:17.438 --> 31:18.344
(Tom yelling)

31:18.344 --> 31:19.319
What happened?

31:19.319 --> 31:20.747
- Fuck, I hit my head.

31:20.747 --> 31:21.580
Sorry.

31:23.371 --> 31:26.389
- [Jacquie] Schmiddy, can
you get a shot of this?

31:26.389 --> 31:29.292
Tom, you witnessed this
happening in real time

31:29.292 --> 31:31.138
when you were living here, right?

31:31.138 --> 31:32.891
- [Tom] Yeah, but I erased it once.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.391
Obviously they wrote it again.

31:38.777 --> 31:41.912
(Jacquie gasping)

31:41.912 --> 31:43.340
Fuck

31:43.340 --> 31:44.173
you!

31:46.242 --> 31:48.727
(thudding)

31:48.727 --> 31:50.364
- [David] Oh.

31:50.364 --> 31:53.023
- [Jacquie] Tom, you shouldn't
antagonize the spirits.

31:53.023 --> 31:55.751
(screaming)

31:55.751 --> 31:56.854
- [David] Jacquie, you all right?

31:56.854 --> 31:57.922
- Fuck!

31:57.922 --> 31:58.816
- What happened?

31:58.816 --> 32:00.941
- Something bit my hand.

32:00.941 --> 32:02.334
- Okay, you ready?

32:02.334 --> 32:03.167
- [Schmiddy] Yeah.

32:03.167 --> 32:04.737
- Okay.

32:04.737 --> 32:07.091
(throat clearing)

32:07.091 --> 32:08.809
- [David] Look at that one.

32:08.809 --> 32:10.513
- Oh, this one? Okay.

32:10.513 --> 32:12.544
You're witnessing paranormal events

32:12.544 --> 32:13.984
as they're unfolding here.

32:13.984 --> 32:15.412
Recorded live.

32:15.412 --> 32:17.165
This isn't Hollywood, folks,

32:17.165 --> 32:20.671
where million dollar budgets
can make anything seem real.

32:20.671 --> 32:21.754
This is real.

32:23.736 --> 32:25.896
Are you scared right now, Tom?

32:25.896 --> 32:27.486
- Well, I'm not "scared" scared.

32:27.486 --> 32:29.936
I mean, I'm not the one that got bit.

32:29.936 --> 32:32.513
- Much worse has happened to me.

32:32.513 --> 32:36.925
So let's talk about the
surveillance system in the house.

32:36.925 --> 32:38.678
- The first day I came to the home

32:38.678 --> 32:41.082
I noticed there were camera everywhere.

32:41.082 --> 32:43.171
I thought it was a little strange

32:43.171 --> 32:46.236
because cameras are
normally outside a home,

32:46.236 --> 32:47.490
not inside a home.

32:47.490 --> 32:48.323
- Yeah,

32:48.323 --> 32:50.637
actually the Harrises,
the previous owners,

32:50.637 --> 32:53.249
installed the cameras after they moved in

32:53.249 --> 32:55.942
because they were noticing
some weird things happening.

32:55.942 --> 32:58.311
When you saw these cameras,

32:58.311 --> 32:59.894
did that alarm you?

33:00.830 --> 33:01.817
- Not really.

33:01.817 --> 33:04.220
Like I said, it was strange,

33:04.220 --> 33:07.367
but I thought maybe they were
shooting a reality show there,

33:07.367 --> 33:10.060
like Jersey Shore or Big
Brother or something.

33:10.060 --> 33:12.231
Obviously you know better now, right?

33:12.231 --> 33:14.066
- Tell you what I do know,

33:14.066 --> 33:17.293
I do know that they had cameras
everywhere in this house.

33:17.293 --> 33:21.705
They could see every
square inch of this place.

33:21.705 --> 33:24.573
- So you actually had
those cameras turned on?

33:24.573 --> 33:25.467
- Yes.

33:25.467 --> 33:27.998
When I came to the house,

33:27.998 --> 33:31.063
the door was open, the
furniture was moved,

33:31.063 --> 33:34.418
at first I thought it was
maybe kids breaking in

33:34.418 --> 33:37.146
or maybe they didn't know
somebody owned the house already.

33:37.146 --> 33:39.399
Or maybe it was somebody moving stuff,

33:39.399 --> 33:41.279
trying to scare me to keep me out of here.

33:41.279 --> 33:43.601
I thought I might be getting pranked.

33:43.601 --> 33:46.098
So I called the surveillance company

33:46.098 --> 33:48.547
and I asked them to turn the camera on

33:48.547 --> 33:50.834
so that I could hopefully capture

33:50.834 --> 33:52.959
whoever was doing this.

33:52.959 --> 33:54.840
- So that's when you realized.

33:54.840 --> 33:57.568
- That's when I realized there was some

33:57.568 --> 34:00.262
supernatural fucking shit going on here.

34:00.262 --> 34:02.050
- [David] Cut!

34:02.050 --> 34:03.153
- Come on.

34:03.153 --> 34:05.765
What is this playing on the
church stage or something?

34:05.765 --> 34:06.995
- Cut! Cut! Cut!

34:06.995 --> 34:08.585
- It's all right, Tom.

34:08.585 --> 34:11.313
David, I actually kinda want to see

34:11.313 --> 34:13.520
what all we're dealing with here,

34:13.520 --> 34:15.447
if you know what I mean?

34:15.447 --> 34:18.501
I'm gonna need some time
to set up, if that's okay?

34:18.501 --> 34:19.732
- Yeah, sure, anything.

34:19.732 --> 34:20.626
We'll help you.

34:20.626 --> 34:21.458
- Okay.

34:21.458 --> 34:22.876
All right, great.

34:24.875 --> 34:27.042
Okay, turn off the lights.

34:40.061 --> 34:42.311
(exhaling)

34:44.065 --> 34:45.610
I know you're here.

34:45.610 --> 34:48.527
(spooky whooshing)

34:50.277 --> 34:52.147
Matt and Rachel, is that you?

34:52.147 --> 34:54.980
(eerie whooshing)

34:57.092 --> 34:58.521
You are welcome here.

34:58.521 --> 34:59.670
- The fuck they are.

34:59.670 --> 35:01.920
(shushing)

35:03.710 --> 35:05.707
- Why haven't you crossed over?

35:05.707 --> 35:07.391
(eerie moaning)

35:07.391 --> 35:09.144
- [David] You have the spectral filter on?

35:09.144 --> 35:11.025
- [Schmiddy] Yeah.

35:11.025 --> 35:15.352
- They say it's because
it's still their house.

35:15.352 --> 35:17.349
Our intent is not to cause any harm.

35:17.349 --> 35:20.766
We just want to understand what happened.

35:25.569 --> 35:27.775
Wait, who's coming?

35:27.775 --> 35:28.858
Don't go! No!

35:30.828 --> 35:33.115
(gasping)

35:33.115 --> 35:34.950
Please, come into the circle guys.

35:34.950 --> 35:35.925
- Who is she talking to?

35:35.925 --> 35:36.758
- Us.

35:36.758 --> 35:37.591
All of us.

35:37.591 --> 35:38.572
- Come on, hurry, hurry, hurry!

35:38.572 --> 35:39.739
Come this way.

35:46.905 --> 35:48.670
- What the fuck is that?

35:48.670 --> 35:50.748
(eerie moaning)

35:50.748 --> 35:52.338
(Jacquie sobbing)

35:52.338 --> 35:53.522
- This is bad.

35:53.522 --> 35:54.544
- What's bad?

35:54.544 --> 35:55.377
(shushing)

35:55.377 --> 35:58.016
- This is really, really bad.

35:58.016 --> 35:59.943
- You smell that?

35:59.943 --> 36:03.612
(menacing moaning)

36:03.612 --> 36:04.923
- No! No! No! No!

36:04.923 --> 36:06.595
You are not welcome here!

36:06.595 --> 36:08.762
(moaning)

36:10.438 --> 36:11.704
Why are you hear?

36:11.704 --> 36:14.153
(moaning)

36:14.153 --> 36:16.766
(sobbing)

36:16.766 --> 36:19.053
Demon, I command you to leave this place!

36:19.053 --> 36:20.109
- [Tom] Demon?

36:20.109 --> 36:22.442
(screaming)

36:24.835 --> 36:26.918
(crying)

36:27.865 --> 36:29.115
- They're gone.

36:32.265 --> 36:34.348
- I just pissed them off.

36:35.574 --> 36:37.199
He'll be back.

36:37.199 --> 36:38.546
Okay,

36:38.546 --> 36:41.727
I want to explain to you
everything that's going on.

36:41.727 --> 36:43.120
- All right.

36:43.120 --> 36:47.811
- There are two completely
different forces at play here

36:47.811 --> 36:49.773
and it's really rare for that to happen

36:49.773 --> 36:52.223
in a single location.

36:52.223 --> 36:53.442
- Lucky us.

36:53.442 --> 36:54.275
- Yeah.

36:56.170 --> 36:57.435
- The first thing that's happening

36:57.435 --> 37:00.709
is I'm sensing the presence
of the previous owners,

37:00.709 --> 37:04.018
the Harrises, in the attic
and around the house.

37:04.018 --> 37:06.108
Now, normally after we die

37:06.108 --> 37:10.230
our spirits cross over into
the afterlife, immediately.

37:10.230 --> 37:13.364
But sometimes our spirits can linger.

37:13.364 --> 37:15.942
And that's what's happening
here with the Harrises.

37:15.942 --> 37:18.972
They haven't crossed over
and they're lingering here.

37:18.972 --> 37:22.362
So what I'm going to do is
attempt to get them to leave

37:22.362 --> 37:26.356
by convincing them that peace
awaits them on the other side

37:26.356 --> 37:27.378
if they cross over.

37:27.378 --> 37:28.933
- Yeah, but I tried that all ready.

37:28.933 --> 37:30.652
- I know, Tom, but I'm a professional.

37:30.652 --> 37:31.998
You're not, okay?

37:31.998 --> 37:33.380
I saw what you did,

37:33.380 --> 37:36.039
but you weren't even
dealing with those spirits.

37:36.039 --> 37:38.488
You were dealing with a
completely different force.

37:38.488 --> 37:40.090
Something very demonic.

37:40.090 --> 37:41.391
Not good.

37:41.391 --> 37:42.250
- Demonic?

37:42.250 --> 37:43.306
- Yes.

37:43.306 --> 37:45.222
Yes, actually the most powerful demonic

37:45.222 --> 37:47.788
presence I ever felt.

37:47.788 --> 37:49.425
Very bad.

37:49.425 --> 37:52.104
- Stop talking like Donald Trump tweets.

37:52.104 --> 37:53.450
- Listen to me, Tom.

37:53.450 --> 37:55.970
Okay, so with demons,

37:55.970 --> 37:58.176
they actually can not cross over.

37:58.176 --> 38:01.276
Because over represents Heaven.

38:01.276 --> 38:03.888
You actually have to banish a demon.

38:03.888 --> 38:05.397
And what you tried doing

38:05.397 --> 38:06.906
was some sort of weird middle ground,

38:06.906 --> 38:09.240
which is why it didn't work.

38:09.240 --> 38:10.912
- You're a professional,

38:10.912 --> 38:12.912
so you can do it, right?

38:13.768 --> 38:15.800
- I'm not sure.

38:15.800 --> 38:17.680
I'm going to try.

38:17.680 --> 38:21.036
I've seen demons, I've dealt with spirits,

38:21.036 --> 38:23.474
but I've never actually had
to deal with both of them

38:23.474 --> 38:26.474
at the same time, in the same place.

38:27.642 --> 38:30.045
- What was it that
attacked me in the bedroom?

38:30.045 --> 38:31.717
- That was the demon.

38:31.717 --> 38:34.085
Yeah, the Harrises are just
moving stuff around the house

38:34.085 --> 38:36.373
because they want to
scare you into leaving.

38:36.373 --> 38:38.091
Because they think it's still theirs,

38:38.091 --> 38:42.863
but the demon actually also
thinks its his house too.

38:42.863 --> 38:45.684
- So the demon beat the
shit out of me in my bed

38:45.684 --> 38:47.565
and the demon's what
attacked me in the basement?

38:47.565 --> 38:48.398
- No,

38:48.398 --> 38:50.305
that was actually Ben.

38:50.305 --> 38:53.532
Ben is neither a Demon or a spirit.

38:53.532 --> 38:56.876
He's what people around
here call the Jersey Devil.

38:56.876 --> 38:59.035
Or the Beast of the Pines.

38:59.035 --> 39:01.241
He's the one who was in the basement

39:01.241 --> 39:02.704
and who attacked you.

39:02.704 --> 39:03.563
- So he's what?

39:03.563 --> 39:05.154
Like a bigfoot or something?

39:05.154 --> 39:06.013
- No.

39:06.013 --> 39:08.857
He's actually a living creature.

39:08.857 --> 39:10.947
But he has demonic powers,

39:10.947 --> 39:14.987
which is why he kind
of seemed like a demon.

39:14.987 --> 39:16.090
- All right.

39:16.090 --> 39:16.938
- You know what,

39:16.938 --> 39:18.691
I actually don't think
he's gonna come back.

39:18.691 --> 39:20.897
Because I haven't sensed his presence.

39:20.897 --> 39:22.000
So I think it's okay.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.637
- Well that's good news, right?

39:23.637 --> 39:24.470
- I guess.

39:24.470 --> 39:26.481
We have to deal with two things.

39:26.481 --> 39:28.408
Not three things.

39:28.408 --> 39:30.762
- Well it sounds like you got a plan.

39:30.762 --> 39:33.258
You've heard my story and all.

39:33.258 --> 39:35.209
I'm gonna go get the fuck out of here.

39:35.209 --> 39:37.252
- Actually, Tom, it's not that simple.

39:37.252 --> 39:38.761
- Yeah, it really is.

39:38.761 --> 39:39.981
I just walk out that door.

39:39.981 --> 39:40.814
- No,

39:40.814 --> 39:44.149
the Harrises' spirits ar going
to stay here, in this house,

39:44.149 --> 39:45.170
until they leave.

39:45.170 --> 39:47.132
But the demon is free
to go wherever he wants.

39:47.132 --> 39:48.398
- And so am I.

39:48.398 --> 39:50.975
- Yeah but Tom, he's going to follow you.

39:50.975 --> 39:53.460
- Last time he didn't.

39:53.460 --> 39:54.400
- Yeah,

39:54.400 --> 39:55.584
Tom, listen to me.

39:55.584 --> 39:58.440
This demon is the most powerful demon

39:58.440 --> 40:00.023
I have ever sensed.

40:01.354 --> 40:02.910
And you know what?

40:02.910 --> 40:04.791
Weirdly enough,

40:04.791 --> 40:06.204
he admires you.

40:06.204 --> 40:07.760
- Excuse me?

40:07.760 --> 40:08.933
- Yeah,

40:08.933 --> 40:11.185
most people, when they
encounter something like that,

40:11.185 --> 40:12.160
would just run away,

40:12.160 --> 40:14.204
but you actually stayed here and fought.

40:14.204 --> 40:16.653
- For a day and then he
scared the shit out of me

40:16.653 --> 40:18.743
and I got the hell out of here.

40:18.743 --> 40:20.461
- But Tom, you've come back

40:20.461 --> 40:22.017
and now he's enraged.

40:22.017 --> 40:23.933
He thinks you're mocking him.

40:23.933 --> 40:26.580
Before, he just wanted to scare you away.

40:26.580 --> 40:28.124
Eventually it worked,

40:28.124 --> 40:30.374
but now he wants your soul.

40:31.572 --> 40:32.989
- I came back?

40:32.989 --> 40:34.219
I came back?

40:34.219 --> 40:37.772
I came back because you
fucking people brought me back.

40:37.772 --> 40:39.769
Oh, I'm going to be sick.

40:39.769 --> 40:42.352
(Tom vomiting)

40:44.192 --> 40:47.304
- Jesus, that's a lot of vomit.

40:47.304 --> 40:48.883
- So, any luck?

40:48.883 --> 40:50.566
- Oh no, not really.

40:50.566 --> 40:53.956
Most of the vanquishing spells
are for lower level demons.

40:53.956 --> 40:56.975
Nothing like I'm seeing here.

40:56.975 --> 40:58.983
- I didn't realize there were
so many levels of demons.

40:58.983 --> 41:00.690
- You wouldn't realize that.

41:00.690 --> 41:02.357
You're a camera man.

41:03.384 --> 41:06.217
(toilet flushing)

41:09.061 --> 41:10.779
- [Tom] Oh God.

41:10.779 --> 41:12.029
- Are you okay?

41:13.507 --> 41:15.586
- Considering the fact that you told me

41:15.586 --> 41:17.629
a demon's falling in love with me

41:17.629 --> 41:20.241
and is going to drag me to hell.

41:20.241 --> 41:22.447
Yeah, I guess I'm doing great.

41:22.447 --> 41:24.444
- Tom, I'm looking into it.

41:24.444 --> 41:26.394
In the event that it comes back,

41:26.394 --> 41:29.053
I think I'll be prepared.

41:29.053 --> 41:30.853
- Does anybody have gum or a mint?

41:30.853 --> 41:32.281
- I got Halls.

41:32.281 --> 41:33.186
- Oh, David,

41:33.186 --> 41:34.939
why don't you and Schmiddy
take Tom around the house

41:34.939 --> 41:35.996
and get some b-roll.

41:35.996 --> 41:37.496
- Yeah, good idea.

41:40.149 --> 41:40.982
Come on.

41:43.748 --> 41:47.591
- Anyway, the first
night or so I was here,

41:47.591 --> 41:50.296
the main activity was these chairs moving.

41:50.296 --> 41:51.515
I found them moved.

41:51.515 --> 41:54.128
I didn't know if anything was going on,

41:54.128 --> 41:57.019
but that chair, actually
right in front of my eyes,

41:57.019 --> 41:59.875
slid across like it was trying to keep me

41:59.875 --> 42:02.308
from going in that basement.

42:02.308 --> 42:03.215
- Huh.

42:03.215 --> 42:06.715
- I would not go down there if I were you.

42:07.789 --> 42:09.914
- Listen, do you hear this?

42:09.914 --> 42:11.423
- [Schmiddy] Hear what?

42:11.423 --> 42:14.082
- There's voices down there.

42:14.082 --> 42:16.999
(eerie whispering)

42:18.482 --> 42:20.247
- What are they saying?

42:20.247 --> 42:22.080
- I can't make it out.

42:23.626 --> 42:25.471
- [Schmiddy] Did the
temperature just drop?

42:25.471 --> 42:26.528
- Yeah, it just dropped.

42:26.528 --> 42:27.596
Um,

42:27.596 --> 42:29.883
Jacquie, could you come in here?

42:29.883 --> 42:31.474
- What's going on?

42:31.474 --> 42:34.040
- The temperature just dropped.

42:34.040 --> 42:37.123
And there are voices in the basement.

42:38.289 --> 42:40.039
- Oh yeah, I feel it.

42:50.131 --> 42:51.298
- Cock sucker.

42:55.321 --> 42:57.488
(banging)

43:03.529 --> 43:04.794
You're the expert on this shit.

43:04.794 --> 43:07.070
Don't go down there.

43:07.070 --> 43:09.570
- Oh, it just got really cold.

43:10.762 --> 43:12.271
- [Tom] Hey, guys?

43:12.271 --> 43:14.141
- [David] Yeah?

43:14.141 --> 43:17.577
- The light just went on upstairs.

43:17.577 --> 43:19.244
- Come on, let's go.

43:38.626 --> 43:42.179
- It's at least 20 degrees
cooler in this room.

43:42.179 --> 43:44.257
We can all feel it.

43:44.257 --> 43:46.498
- What the fuck is that?

43:46.498 --> 43:49.165
(eerie buzzing)

43:53.893 --> 43:54.726
- Where'd it go?

43:54.726 --> 43:56.087
- [Jacquie] I don't know.

43:56.087 --> 43:57.481
I don't feel anything.

43:57.481 --> 43:58.700
- Did you get that?

43:58.700 --> 44:00.093
- [Schmiddy] I got everything.

44:00.093 --> 44:00.926
- Oh my God.

44:00.926 --> 44:01.759
- Oh shit, Tom!

44:01.759 --> 44:02.592
Tom!

44:03.727 --> 44:04.911
- [Tom] Help me!

44:04.911 --> 44:05.744
- Tom!

44:05.744 --> 44:06.577
- [Tom] Help me!

44:06.577 --> 44:07.604
(Tom coughing)

44:07.604 --> 44:09.195
- I command you to release him!

44:09.195 --> 44:11.445
(coughing)

44:15.151 --> 44:16.173
Are you okay?

44:16.173 --> 44:18.704
- I want the fuck out of here.

44:18.704 --> 44:20.178
- Tom, it's gone.

44:20.178 --> 44:22.338
- I heard its voice.

44:22.338 --> 44:24.543
It leaned over me and

44:24.543 --> 44:26.626
I could heart it talking.

44:27.887 --> 44:29.153
- What did it say?

44:29.153 --> 44:31.637
- It says I shouldn't have come back here.

44:31.637 --> 44:34.804
Why did you people bring me back here?

44:38.034 --> 44:39.034
- Hey, look,

44:43.352 --> 44:46.045
I'm pretty happy with what we have so far.

44:46.045 --> 44:48.205
Tom, I'm a little worried about.

44:48.205 --> 44:50.283
He's kind of shaken up.

44:50.283 --> 44:51.804
I think maybe it's a good idea

44:51.804 --> 44:53.185
if we get him out of here

44:53.185 --> 44:55.031
before anything really bad happens.

44:55.031 --> 44:58.131
- If we leave, the demon
will just follow him, right?

44:58.131 --> 44:58.964
- Well.

45:00.941 --> 45:02.856
- I may have embellished a little bit.

45:02.856 --> 45:03.689
- Oh, Jacquie.

45:03.689 --> 45:05.149
- Dick move, Jac!

45:05.149 --> 45:06.171
Dick move!

45:06.171 --> 45:07.715
- What was I gonna do?

45:07.715 --> 45:10.603
He was gonna leave if I didn't
find a way to keep him here.

45:10.603 --> 45:12.770
(sighing)

45:14.759 --> 45:17.000
- I really think maybe it's a good idea

45:17.000 --> 45:18.474
we all just get out of here.

45:18.474 --> 45:19.333
- No.

45:19.333 --> 45:20.166
- No?

45:20.166 --> 45:20.999
No what?

45:20.999 --> 45:21.980
No why? Why?

45:21.980 --> 45:25.324
- Because we're missing something, guys.

45:25.324 --> 45:27.007
- What are we missing?

45:27.007 --> 45:27.840
- Bad Ben!

45:29.039 --> 45:29.884
Okay, I know,

45:29.884 --> 45:31.428
we've all walked around this house.

45:31.428 --> 45:34.365
We've all felt the change in temperature.

45:34.365 --> 45:36.455
We've all smelled the weird things.

45:36.455 --> 45:38.788
But the people at home
can't experience that.

45:38.788 --> 45:41.877
It's gonna be just a bunch of
us walking around being like,

45:41.877 --> 45:43.270
"Oh this smells weird.

45:43.270 --> 45:44.744
"Oh, the temperature.

45:44.744 --> 45:46.579
"Oh, bur, it's so cold."

45:46.579 --> 45:47.879
That sucks, okay?

45:47.879 --> 45:49.760
They are gonna want more.

45:49.760 --> 45:50.593
- Look.

45:50.593 --> 45:51.986
- No, I want more.

45:51.986 --> 45:52.892
- Look,

45:52.892 --> 45:54.401
between what we just got upstairs,

45:54.401 --> 45:56.363
between what we shot earlier,

45:56.363 --> 45:58.859
we're fine, we're good,

45:58.859 --> 46:00.113
and if it's not more,

46:00.113 --> 46:02.772
I'll just make up some shit in post.

46:02.772 --> 46:04.618
- No, it's not good enough.

46:04.618 --> 46:05.951
We need Bad Ben.

46:07.636 --> 46:08.983
I have an idea.

46:08.983 --> 46:10.608
- Oh God, I fucking hate ideas.

46:10.608 --> 46:11.944
- Listen to me.

46:11.944 --> 46:14.834
All right, I'm gonna need
you to go and distract Tom.

46:14.834 --> 46:15.667
- Oh, great.

46:15.667 --> 46:16.712
- I'm going up to the attic.

46:16.712 --> 46:17.699
- Oh, great.

46:17.699 --> 46:20.671
- I need you to go
outside with the camera.

46:20.671 --> 46:24.235
Go to the car, get the
holy water from the kit

46:24.235 --> 46:26.070
and I will meet you out there afterwards.

46:26.070 --> 46:26.903
All right?

46:26.903 --> 46:28.601
Just trust me on this.

46:28.601 --> 46:30.768
(sighing)

46:35.091 --> 46:36.562
(crickets chirping)

46:36.562 --> 46:37.743
Schmiddy, where are you?

46:37.743 --> 46:38.576
- Over here.

46:38.576 --> 46:40.890
Just getting this Go Pro ready.

46:40.890 --> 46:41.723
All right.

46:45.766 --> 46:47.647
What are we doing?

46:47.647 --> 46:51.199
- Our viewers care about Tom's story

46:51.199 --> 46:55.030
and his story revolves
around this creature.

46:55.030 --> 46:55.863
So.

46:59.245 --> 47:01.358
Beast of the Pines,

47:01.358 --> 47:02.525
show yourself!

47:04.144 --> 47:06.477
- [Schmiddy] Jesus, Jacquie.

47:08.068 --> 47:10.019
- I know you're here!

47:10.019 --> 47:11.157
- [Schmiddy] I think we should
get out of her, Jacquie.

47:11.157 --> 47:11.990
- Shut up!

47:12.875 --> 47:14.582
You have that holy water?

47:14.582 --> 47:16.082
- [Schmiddy] Yeah.

47:17.275 --> 47:18.275
- Thank you.

47:23.568 --> 47:25.112
- [Schmiddy] What is that?

47:25.112 --> 47:26.877
- The mother's ashes.

47:26.877 --> 47:29.210
- [Schmiddy] Jesus, Jacquie.

47:31.648 --> 47:34.621
(creature screaming)

47:34.621 --> 47:35.642
Did you hear that?

47:35.642 --> 47:38.975
- It really go its attention, didn't it?

47:40.008 --> 47:41.261
Follow me.

47:41.261 --> 47:42.094
Come on.

47:43.107 --> 47:44.277
(creature screeching)

47:44.277 --> 47:45.944
- [Schmiddy] Oh God.

47:50.779 --> 47:51.612
- Watch out.

47:51.612 --> 47:54.779
(creature screeching)

47:57.451 --> 47:59.785
- [Schmiddy] What are we doing?

47:59.785 --> 48:01.618
What the fuck is that?

48:07.053 --> 48:08.636
What are you doing?

48:12.649 --> 48:14.820
Jac, Jac, Jac don't!

48:14.820 --> 48:17.223
(creature screeching)

48:17.223 --> 48:19.556
(whooshing)

48:21.826 --> 48:23.533
(creature howling)

48:23.533 --> 48:25.367
There's something back here.

48:25.367 --> 48:27.689
(crunching)

48:27.689 --> 48:29.022
- [Jacquie] Run!

48:30.464 --> 48:32.217
- [Schmiddy] Fuck!

48:32.217 --> 48:34.467
(rumbling)

48:39.670 --> 48:42.670
(creature growling)

48:46.554 --> 48:47.530
Oh God!

48:47.530 --> 48:48.363
Oh God!

48:48.363 --> 48:49.573
Oh my God!

48:49.573 --> 48:50.873
What the fuck is that?

48:50.873 --> 48:52.917
- Hey, leave them alone!

48:52.917 --> 48:54.832
(metal cranking)

48:54.832 --> 48:56.452
This is what you want.
(music box chiming)

48:56.452 --> 48:58.646
Come on, you big bad boy.

48:58.646 --> 49:00.608
(music box chiming)

49:00.608 --> 49:01.548
- Let's go.

49:01.548 --> 49:02.651
- [Schmiddy] What?

49:02.651 --> 49:04.532
We're just gonna leave Tom?

49:04.532 --> 49:05.519
- What about him?

49:05.519 --> 49:07.110
I mean...

49:07.110 --> 49:08.781
- [Schmiddy] We've got to help him though.

49:08.781 --> 49:10.453
- And then all three of us get killed?

49:10.453 --> 49:11.286
No.

49:12.125 --> 49:13.344
Come on!

49:13.344 --> 49:14.285
- [Schmiddy] Fuck.

49:14.285 --> 49:16.490
Come on! Come on! Come on!

49:16.490 --> 49:19.196
- Look, this is really bad.

49:19.196 --> 49:21.692
- I really think we should
consider calling the police.

49:21.692 --> 49:22.525
- What?

49:22.525 --> 49:23.491
We can't call the cops.

49:23.491 --> 49:24.385
What are you, an idiot?

49:24.385 --> 49:25.535
- Don't call me an idiot!

49:25.535 --> 49:27.659
I'm dyslexic, okay?

49:27.659 --> 49:28.659
- I'm sorry.

49:29.819 --> 49:32.710
- Fine, if we don't call the
cops, what're we gonna do?

49:32.710 --> 49:33.543
- I don't know.

49:33.543 --> 49:34.376
Shut up, okay?

49:34.376 --> 49:35.809
I'm trying to think.

49:35.809 --> 49:39.977
- Look, we need to delete all the footage.

49:39.977 --> 49:40.810
- Yes.

49:40.810 --> 49:41.974
- What?

49:41.974 --> 49:43.936
Are you insane, David?

49:43.936 --> 49:46.189
- Everything that we've done here tonight

49:46.189 --> 49:47.745
has been documented on tape.

49:47.745 --> 49:50.101
They're gonna play it at out trial.

49:50.101 --> 49:52.063
- Jacquie, I can't go to jail!

49:52.063 --> 49:54.954
Look at me, they'll view me as weak.

49:54.954 --> 49:56.204
- You are weak.

49:57.207 --> 49:58.344
Okay, listen,

49:58.344 --> 50:01.653
we can delete all the
incriminating stuff off the camera,

50:01.653 --> 50:04.820
but we are keeping the
rest of that footage!

50:04.820 --> 50:05.737
- Whatever.

50:06.619 --> 50:11.530
- How're we gonna explain
Tom's disappearance then?

50:11.530 --> 50:14.197
- Grab the camera and follow me.

50:16.949 --> 50:18.574
(sighing)

50:18.574 --> 50:20.324
- [Schmiddy] Testing.

50:29.859 --> 50:30.718
- Okay, ready?

50:30.718 --> 50:33.135
- [Schmiddy] Yeah, I'm ready.

50:35.246 --> 50:38.056
- Well folks, it appears that

50:38.056 --> 50:40.409
the horrific memories of
what happened here before

50:40.409 --> 50:43.228
were just too much for
Tom Riley to handle.

50:43.228 --> 50:46.664
Last year he disappeared and
was believed to have died.

50:46.664 --> 50:49.799
But it turns out he was
just hiding in the woods.

50:49.799 --> 50:52.005
This time, however,

50:52.005 --> 50:54.130
he has voluntarily surrendered.

50:54.130 --> 50:55.151
Fled

50:55.151 --> 50:57.195
to who knows where.

50:57.195 --> 50:59.772
It appears that this may be the last time

50:59.772 --> 51:01.855
we'll ever see Tom Riley.

51:04.381 --> 51:05.214
See?

51:05.214 --> 51:06.047
Problem solved.

51:06.047 --> 51:07.106
- [David] Good one.

51:07.106 --> 51:09.150
(doorbell ringing)

51:09.150 --> 51:10.125
Who is that?

51:10.125 --> 51:12.168
- [Jacquie] Oh my God.

51:12.168 --> 51:13.550
- [David] Oh my god.

51:13.550 --> 51:14.885
- [Schmiddy] Fuck.

51:14.885 --> 51:17.355
- [David] Give him all that money?

51:17.355 --> 51:19.105
- [Jacquie] Schmiddy?

51:26.713 --> 51:27.607
- [Schmiddy] Hey Tom!

51:27.607 --> 51:28.710
- [Jacquie] Tom!

51:28.710 --> 51:30.300
We're so happy you're alive.

51:30.300 --> 51:31.438
- Bullshit!

51:31.438 --> 51:32.669
What did you do?

51:32.669 --> 51:33.969
- [Jacquie] What do you mean?

51:33.969 --> 51:35.966
- What did you do to
get that thing out there

51:35.966 --> 51:36.799
all rilled up?

51:36.799 --> 51:38.056
- [Schmiddy] Tom, let's
put down the stick.

51:38.056 --> 51:39.785
- I want to see that footage!

51:39.785 --> 51:41.132
- [David] There's no
footage, what footage?

51:41.132 --> 51:45.091
- You, yourself, said you
couldn't sense that Bad Ben

51:45.091 --> 51:46.554
and now he's back.

51:46.554 --> 51:49.457
So you guys disappear
out there, conveniently?

51:49.457 --> 51:50.850
What did you do?

51:50.850 --> 51:53.462
- We just went back there by the grave,

51:53.462 --> 51:54.646
but we weren't filming or anything.

51:54.646 --> 51:57.793
- I will make a kabob
out of the three of you!

51:57.793 --> 51:58.930
Give me that camera!

51:58.930 --> 51:59.952
- Wait! No, no, no, no!

51:59.952 --> 52:02.808
There's no footage, there's no footage!

52:02.808 --> 52:04.558
Okay, guys, new plan.

52:06.233 --> 52:08.392
I say we get the fuck out of here

52:08.392 --> 52:11.249
while he's in the shower.

52:11.249 --> 52:14.557
You guys saw how pissed he
was when he watched the tape.

52:14.557 --> 52:15.776
- Look,

52:15.776 --> 52:17.379
we're not leaving him.

52:17.379 --> 52:20.026
Let's let him come down then
we'll all leave together.

52:20.026 --> 52:20.859
I know, I know,

52:20.859 --> 52:22.603
you're not gonna wanna do that.

52:22.603 --> 52:23.590
- Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

52:23.590 --> 52:24.423
- Stop what?

52:24.423 --> 52:26.202
- We are almost done here.

52:26.202 --> 52:27.035
- Done?

52:27.035 --> 52:28.002
Hey, I'm done.

52:28.002 --> 52:29.314
You guys do whatever you wanna do.

52:29.314 --> 52:30.208
I'm leaving.

52:30.208 --> 52:31.067
- Come on.

52:31.067 --> 52:33.234
(banging)

52:36.454 --> 52:37.638
Did you guys hear that?

52:37.638 --> 52:39.638
- Of course we heard it.

52:42.050 --> 52:44.133
- Where's it coming from?

52:46.334 --> 52:47.402
- Schmiddy, grab the camera.

52:47.402 --> 52:48.873
- Let's go this.

52:48.873 --> 52:51.123
(thudding)

52:53.493 --> 52:55.038
- It's coming from downstairs.

52:55.038 --> 52:57.288
(thudding)

52:58.137 --> 52:59.658
- [Schmiddy] Oh shit.

52:59.658 --> 53:01.330
We're not going down there, are we?

53:01.330 --> 53:03.281
- Yes, come on!

53:03.281 --> 53:04.871
Come on!

53:04.871 --> 53:06.137
- [Schmiddy] Should I bring the camera?

53:06.137 --> 53:08.099
- Yes, of course bring
the camera, you idiot!

53:08.099 --> 53:11.036
- [Schmiddy] Don't call me an idiot!

53:11.036 --> 53:12.348
- I see you decided to stick around.

53:12.348 --> 53:13.648
- I'm leaving.

53:13.648 --> 53:15.251
Just after this.

53:15.251 --> 53:16.713
- All right.

53:16.713 --> 53:18.963
(thudding)

53:27.743 --> 53:28.910
- Wait for me!

53:31.493 --> 53:34.477
(group screaming)

53:34.477 --> 53:37.693
(camera clattering)

53:37.693 --> 53:41.199
(metal clanking)

53:41.199 --> 53:43.858
- All right, I don't wanna
hear shit about my outfit.

53:43.858 --> 53:45.657
My clothes were ruined.

53:45.657 --> 53:48.824
What I came here with is in the dryer.

53:49.941 --> 53:50.774
Guys?

53:52.855 --> 53:53.688
Hello?

53:56.002 --> 53:59.020
(audio crackling)

53:59.020 --> 54:02.619
(crickets chirping)

54:02.619 --> 54:03.452
Jacquie?

54:05.510 --> 54:06.343
Schmiddy?

54:07.960 --> 54:08.793
David?

54:12.987 --> 54:14.487
You motherfuckers!

54:15.762 --> 54:18.512
You better not have left me here.

54:25.491 --> 54:28.491
(crickets chirping)

54:31.865 --> 54:33.908
There car's still here.

54:33.908 --> 54:36.908
(Bad Ben squealing)

54:38.320 --> 54:39.713
I ain't scared of you.

54:39.713 --> 54:42.713
(Bad Ben squealing)

54:52.633 --> 54:54.966
Where the fuck are you guys?

54:58.357 --> 54:59.190
Jacquie?

55:02.316 --> 55:03.149
Hello?

55:12.353 --> 55:13.186
Guys?

55:20.381 --> 55:23.381
(crickets chirping)

55:29.808 --> 55:32.558
(blinds zipping)

55:39.978 --> 55:41.145
Come on, guys.

55:42.138 --> 55:43.305
Where are you?

56:05.674 --> 56:08.341
(demon howling)

56:13.685 --> 56:14.518
Oh, Jesus.

56:21.766 --> 56:24.766
(music box chiming)

57:02.635 --> 57:05.385
(door squeaking)

57:23.450 --> 57:26.200
(demon growling)

57:45.114 --> 57:45.973
What the hell am I gonna do

57:45.973 --> 57:48.504
if I get this window open anyway? Jump?

57:48.504 --> 57:50.421
I'm 30 feet in the air.

58:01.659 --> 58:03.168
(demon growling)

58:03.168 --> 58:05.418
(thudding)

58:07.336 --> 58:10.169
(heavy breathing)

58:31.166 --> 58:32.838
(growling)

58:32.838 --> 58:35.088
(thudding)

58:39.211 --> 58:40.044
Oh no!

58:42.927 --> 58:45.539
(groaning)

58:45.539 --> 58:46.956
He broke his toy.

58:47.942 --> 58:48.775
Ouch.

58:52.807 --> 58:54.479
He's gonna be pissed.

58:54.479 --> 58:57.229
(demon growling)

59:15.270 --> 59:17.937
(dryer buzzing)

59:57.101 --> 59:57.934
Where?

59:59.214 --> 01:00:01.141
Oh, here it is.

01:00:01.141 --> 01:00:02.441
Oh shit.

01:00:02.441 --> 01:00:03.707
I forgot about this.

01:00:03.707 --> 01:00:04.540
My iPad.

01:00:05.506 --> 01:00:06.339
Bonus!

01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:14.249
Okay, well she has this page marked.

01:00:14.249 --> 01:00:17.166
So let me see what she was reading.

01:00:23.444 --> 01:00:25.568
"Vanquishing a demon."

01:00:25.568 --> 01:00:28.318
(demon growling)

01:00:33.266 --> 01:00:34.099
All right.

01:00:35.634 --> 01:00:38.634
Where the hell do I find that stuff?

01:00:47.527 --> 01:00:49.777
(thudding)

01:01:00.519 --> 01:01:01.352
Fuck.

01:01:06.637 --> 01:01:08.887
(thudding)

01:01:10.352 --> 01:01:12.512
Where the fuck is?

01:01:12.512 --> 01:01:13.762
Oh, here it is.

01:01:17.249 --> 01:01:19.416
(sighing)

01:01:20.476 --> 01:01:21.309
All right.

01:01:21.309 --> 01:01:24.226
(lighter clicking)

01:01:31.738 --> 01:01:34.155
Are you fucking shitting me?!

01:01:37.253 --> 01:01:38.086
Pete!

01:01:43.275 --> 01:01:45.525
(growling)

01:01:48.813 --> 01:01:49.896
Oh, it's lit.

01:01:52.319 --> 01:01:54.363

01:01:54.363 --> 01:01:56.030
Are you shitting me?

01:01:56.929 --> 01:01:59.007
(growling)

01:01:59.007 --> 01:02:01.131
You know, I can smell you.

01:02:01.131 --> 01:02:03.964
You don't have to make that noise.

01:02:12.173 --> 01:02:15.590
What the fuck are these cameras doing on?

01:02:21.043 --> 01:02:23.980
I should've stayed in
that tent in the woods.

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:26.230
(fizzling)

01:02:33.256 --> 01:02:35.485
Pete, buddy, you sold me out.

I'm leaving here.

01:04:42.138 --> 01:04:44.263
I don't care what happens to those three.

01:04:44.263 --> 01:04:46.016
I don't care what you did to them.

01:04:46.016 --> 01:04:48.837
They're staying here,
I'm getting the fuck out.

01:04:48.837 --> 01:04:50.474
I'm telling you right now,

01:04:50.474 --> 01:04:52.309
if you attempt to follow me,

01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:55.583
I will come back here
with a busload of nuns.

Fuck it.

I don't know why I give a fuck,

01:05:21.601 --> 01:05:23.191
but you can't have them!

01:05:23.191 --> 01:05:24.166
Where are they?

01:05:24.166 --> 01:05:25.803
I'm taking them with me!

01:05:25.803 --> 01:05:26.988
(demon growling)

01:05:26.988 --> 01:05:28.090
I'm telling you right now,

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:31.318
I'm not leaving here
until they're with me.

Come on, you mother!

01:05:50.726 --> 01:05:53.872
You've gotta be fucking shitting me!

01:05:53.872 --> 01:05:56.122

01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:36.603
(thudding)

01:06:36.603 --> 01:06:38.356
What the fuck is this, the White House?

01:06:38.356 --> 01:06:40.523
Is this bulletproof glass?

01:06:50.744 --> 01:06:52.497
I'm gonna get out of here.

01:06:52.497 --> 01:06:53.763
I promise you,

01:06:53.763 --> 01:06:56.828
I'm gonna get the fuck out of here.

01:06:56.828 --> 01:06:58.825
(door squeaking)

01:06:58.825 --> 01:07:01.077
(growling)

01:07:01.077 --> 01:07:01.936
Good!

01:07:01.936 --> 01:07:02.769
Stay out!

01:07:12.594 --> 01:07:13.616
Oh shit.

01:07:13.616 --> 01:07:14.449
Two more.

01:07:25.702 --> 01:07:27.952
(clanking)

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:35.800
(fizzling)

01:07:43.151 --> 01:07:45.401
(fizzling)

01:07:49.641 --> 01:07:50.474
Last one.

01:07:55.563 --> 01:07:57.200
Wait.

01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:59.881
This isn't the last one.

01:07:59.881 --> 01:08:01.275
The basement.

01:08:01.275 --> 01:08:03.306
I never checked the basement.

01:08:03.306 --> 01:08:05.512
(fizzling)

01:08:05.512 --> 01:08:06.345
Guys?

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:12.754
Jacquie?

01:08:14.731 --> 01:08:15.564
David?

01:08:18.457 --> 01:08:19.290
Schmiddy?

01:08:20.791 --> 01:08:24.124
What the fuck did they do to the camera?

01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:33.256
That's no way to use that thing.

01:08:44.232 --> 01:08:45.064
Guys?

01:08:53.787 --> 01:08:55.341
Son of a bitch.

01:08:55.341 --> 01:08:57.955
(groaning)

01:08:57.955 --> 01:08:59.870
I need something to open this.

01:08:59.870 --> 01:09:02.037
Let me look for something.

01:09:03.957 --> 01:09:04.790
Ow, fuck!

01:09:07.868 --> 01:09:10.118
(thudding)

01:09:19.478 --> 01:09:20.310
Oh no.

01:09:22.323 --> 01:09:24.412
This does not look good.

01:09:24.412 --> 01:09:25.245
Guys?

01:09:37.729 --> 01:09:39.157
(screaming)

01:09:39.157 --> 01:09:40.538
Jesus Christ!

01:09:40.538 --> 01:09:42.419
(gasping)

01:09:42.419 --> 01:09:43.929
- What happened?

01:09:43.929 --> 01:09:45.274
- We shouldn't be here.

01:09:45.274 --> 01:09:46.377
We have to leave right now.

01:09:46.377 --> 01:09:48.410
The demon is here.

01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:51.069
- [Tom] That's gonna be a
little bit of a problem.

01:09:51.069 --> 01:09:51.902
- Why?

01:09:51.902 --> 01:09:53.796
- [Tom] All the doors are locked.

01:09:53.796 --> 01:09:55.156
None of them will open.

01:09:55.156 --> 01:09:56.746
It's got us trapped in here.

01:09:56.746 --> 01:09:58.662
I can't even break a window.

01:09:58.662 --> 01:09:59.718
- Fuck.

01:09:59.718 --> 01:10:01.553
- What're we supposed to
do, just die out here?

01:10:01.553 --> 01:10:02.865
- [Tom] Listen, geniuses,

01:10:02.865 --> 01:10:05.721
we've been doing this
your way up to this point.

01:10:05.721 --> 01:10:07.892
Now we're gonna do it my way.

01:10:07.892 --> 01:10:09.610
- Which is what?

01:10:09.610 --> 01:10:10.527
- We fight.

01:10:28.105 --> 01:10:30.272
(sobbing)

01:10:35.036 --> 01:10:36.369
- So this is it.

01:10:37.985 --> 01:10:41.818
I don't think we're
getting out of here alive.

01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:48.573
If you find this tape, it means...

01:10:53.647 --> 01:10:56.980
It means none of us made it out of here.

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:04.757
I don't want tonight to be
the last night of my life.

01:11:04.757 --> 01:11:07.674
Everyone was so mean to me tonight.

01:11:09.622 --> 01:11:11.085
Everyone is calling me Schmiddy.

01:11:11.085 --> 01:11:12.559
I don't even know why.

01:11:12.559 --> 01:11:13.598
That's not even my name.

01:11:13.598 --> 01:11:16.098
My name is Tristen Carmichael.

01:11:19.879 --> 01:11:21.712
If you find this tape,

01:11:23.745 --> 01:11:26.078
please promise me one thing.

01:11:27.495 --> 01:11:28.745
Please, please,

01:11:29.864 --> 01:11:32.917
delete all the history
on my internet browsers.

01:11:32.917 --> 01:11:35.334
That's all I ask for, please.

01:11:38.559 --> 01:11:39.559
I'm so sorry

01:11:40.591 --> 01:11:43.819
that I'm a paranormal investigator.

01:11:43.819 --> 01:11:45.319
What a stupid job.

01:11:50.599 --> 01:11:53.211
Pull it together, Tristen.

01:11:53.211 --> 01:11:55.046
Pull it together, Tristen.

01:11:55.046 --> 01:11:57.046
You're better than this.

01:11:58.227 --> 01:12:00.394
(huffing)

01:12:04.067 --> 01:12:05.332
Okay.

01:12:05.332 --> 01:12:06.165
Okay.

01:12:21.888 --> 01:12:23.107
- You got anything?

01:12:23.107 --> 01:12:23.940
- Nah.

01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:26.366
The EMF interference is
blocking our signals.

01:12:26.366 --> 01:12:27.632
- Look,

01:12:27.632 --> 01:12:30.488
the realtor is coming at nine
to see if we're out of here,

01:12:30.488 --> 01:12:33.054
if we can make it till then.

01:12:33.054 --> 01:12:35.422
- If we can't get out,
how is she gonna get in?

01:12:35.422 --> 01:12:37.094
- We can yell through the door.

01:12:37.094 --> 01:12:39.261
Have her get us some help.

01:12:41.099 --> 01:12:43.516
Schmiddy, what are you doing?

01:12:46.132 --> 01:12:48.698
- I'm just doing SOS in the lights.

01:12:48.698 --> 01:12:50.497
You know, Morse Code.

01:12:50.497 --> 01:12:51.330
- No you're not.

01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:53.664
You're spellins "O-S-O," Einstein.

01:12:53.664 --> 01:12:55.742
- [Schmiddy] It's the
thought that counts, Tom.

01:12:55.742 --> 01:12:57.866
- Guys, what's important right now

01:12:57.866 --> 01:12:59.620
is that we don't provoke the demon,

01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:01.384
so just be quiet.

01:13:01.384 --> 01:13:02.217
All right?

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:07.584
Just calm down.

01:13:07.584 --> 01:13:09.251
- How about you sit?

01:13:10.196 --> 01:13:11.613
- I say we fight.

01:13:13.598 --> 01:13:14.782
(bottle rattling)

01:13:14.782 --> 01:13:15.955
- Wait, what are those?

01:13:15.955 --> 01:13:17.592
Are those pills?

01:13:17.592 --> 01:13:18.648
Give me some, I want some.

01:13:18.648 --> 01:13:20.158
- It's an asprin, you idiot.

01:13:20.158 --> 01:13:21.342
- Don't call me an idiot.

01:13:21.342 --> 01:13:22.781
- Guys, hold it down.

01:13:22.781 --> 01:13:24.360
- No, she keeps calling me an idiot.

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:26.729
I am a human being, goddamn it!

01:13:26.729 --> 01:13:28.319
(demon growling)

01:13:28.319 --> 01:13:29.910
- Uh oh.

01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:31.431
- What was that?

01:13:31.431 --> 01:13:32.847
- Was it a growl?

01:13:32.847 --> 01:13:34.275
- Schmiddy, shut up!

01:13:34.275 --> 01:13:35.994
- Why? Jesus Christ!

01:13:35.994 --> 01:13:37.503
(demon growling)

01:13:37.503 --> 01:13:38.850
- That did it.

01:13:38.850 --> 01:13:41.543
- Schmiddy, please, are you crazy?

01:13:41.543 --> 01:13:43.958
- [Tom] Fight's on!

01:13:43.958 --> 01:13:46.708
(demon growling)

01:13:56.056 --> 01:13:58.865
(Jacquie gasping)

01:13:58.865 --> 01:14:01.115
(groaning)

01:14:05.088 --> 01:14:07.838
(demon growling)

01:14:10.278 --> 01:14:13.195
- What the fuck is with this bitch?

01:14:16.327 --> 01:14:17.160
- Jacquie?

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:17.993
Jacquie?

01:14:20.402 --> 01:14:22.167
- Oh, fuck this.

01:14:22.167 --> 01:14:24.047
- [Schmiddy] Tom, where you going?

01:14:24.047 --> 01:14:24.880
Help us!

01:14:26.985 --> 01:14:27.818
- Shit.

01:14:27.818 --> 01:14:30.055
(growling)

01:14:30.055 --> 01:14:31.402
Jacquie?

01:14:31.402 --> 01:14:32.458
- Jacquie?

01:14:32.458 --> 01:14:34.177
(growling)

01:14:34.177 --> 01:14:36.174
- [Schmiddy] Let's get
the fuck out of here.

01:14:36.174 --> 01:14:37.757
Run! Run! Run! Run!

01:14:40.713 --> 01:14:41.700
(gasping)

01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:43.867
(yelling)

01:14:47.575 --> 01:14:49.825
(growling)

01:14:51.806 --> 01:14:55.556
(David and Schmiddy yelling)

01:14:57.727 --> 01:14:59.977
(growling)

01:15:01.071 --> 01:15:03.033
(yelling)

01:15:03.033 --> 01:15:05.283
(shushing)

01:15:11.729 --> 01:15:12.646
- No! Fuck!

01:15:13.679 --> 01:15:15.479
- Oh my God.

01:15:15.479 --> 01:15:16.988
- Oh God, this is it.

01:15:16.988 --> 01:15:18.254
(growling)

01:15:18.254 --> 01:15:19.087
Oh shit!

01:15:21.284 --> 01:15:22.284
- Yo, bitch!

01:15:23.443 --> 01:15:24.744
Hey Ben!

01:15:24.744 --> 01:15:26.578
There's someone in here you wanna meet.

01:15:26.578 --> 01:15:27.472
(Ben screeching)

01:15:27.472 --> 01:15:29.190
This is the bitch that broke your toy.

01:15:29.190 --> 01:15:30.746
(Ben screeching)

01:15:30.746 --> 01:15:33.496
(demon growling)

01:15:37.398 --> 01:15:39.361
Kick that demon's ass, Ben.

01:15:39.361 --> 01:15:42.778
(Ben and demon fighting)

01:15:46.350 --> 01:15:48.183
Well folks, it's done.

01:15:53.556 --> 01:15:54.389
All right.

01:15:56.818 --> 01:15:58.246
- The last of it.

01:15:58.246 --> 01:15:59.802
(sighing)

01:15:59.802 --> 01:16:00.983
- You got both cameras?

01:16:00.983 --> 01:16:04.779
- Yeah, I set two up
front to catch our exit.

01:16:04.779 --> 01:16:05.755
- All right.

01:16:05.755 --> 01:16:06.776
- Let's get out of here.

01:16:06.776 --> 01:16:07.609
- Yeah.

01:16:20.894 --> 01:16:23.061
(yawning)

01:16:29.068 --> 01:16:32.133
- Tom, that was unbelievable.

01:16:32.133 --> 01:16:34.745
- Yeah, I mean, you saved my life.

01:16:34.745 --> 01:16:35.894
- All of our lives.

01:16:35.894 --> 01:16:37.972
- Yeah, Tom, you're like a superhero.

01:16:37.972 --> 01:16:41.397
- Truth is, Ben is the superhero.

01:16:41.397 --> 01:16:43.812
- I guess Ben is a superhero.

01:16:43.812 --> 01:16:45.205
- Yeah.

01:16:45.205 --> 01:16:46.424
Oh, David,

01:16:46.424 --> 01:16:47.980
guard that footage with your life.

01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:49.118
- Oh you know it.

01:16:49.118 --> 01:16:51.614
Those tapes are gold.

01:16:51.614 --> 01:16:53.530
Let's get started editing right now.

01:16:53.530 --> 01:16:55.248
- Can we at least take a nap first?

01:16:55.248 --> 01:16:58.665
- Okay, let's meet at the studio tonight.

01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:05.337
- So what's next for you, Tom?

01:17:05.337 --> 01:17:06.196
- Actually,

01:17:06.196 --> 01:17:09.552
I was thinking maybe I become
a paranormal investigator.

01:17:09.552 --> 01:17:10.736
- You know,

01:17:10.736 --> 01:17:13.104
that's a really good idea.

01:17:13.104 --> 01:17:16.250
- Yeah, I mean you actually
did a really good job in there.

01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:18.247
- You kinda started out as a wuss.

01:17:18.247 --> 01:17:20.414
- We could work as a team.

01:17:21.347 --> 01:17:23.100
- I'll think about that.

01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:25.631
But if you knuckleheads could do this,

01:17:25.631 --> 01:17:27.350
I'm sure I could do it.

01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:28.371
- Where you going?

01:17:28.371 --> 01:17:31.343
- I forgot that iPod she gave me.

01:17:31.343 --> 01:17:32.980
- Wow.

01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:34.897
I got Tom to like Abba.

01:17:36.046 --> 01:17:37.379
I'm a superhero.

01:17:48.515 --> 01:17:50.765
(groaning)

01:18:07.903 --> 01:18:08.736
- Hello?

01:18:27.681 --> 01:18:28.703
(Ben screeching)

01:18:28.703 --> 01:18:30.177
No! No! No! No!

01:18:30.177 --> 01:18:31.315
Not again!

01:18:31.315 --> 01:18:32.383
Not again!

01:18:32.383 --> 01:18:33.637
Not again!

01:18:33.637 --> 01:18:34.496
No!

01:18:34.496 --> 01:18:36.331
(Ben screeching)

01:18:36.331 --> 01:18:37.248
No, please!

01:18:38.472 --> 01:18:39.305
Please!

01:18:39.305 --> 01:18:40.138
No!

01:18:40.138 --> 01:18:42.350
(Ben squealing)

01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:43.244
No, stop!

01:18:43.244 --> 01:18:44.219
No!

01:18:44.219 --> 01:18:45.078
No! No!

01:18:45.078 --> 01:18:47.575
(screaming)

01:18:47.575 --> 01:18:48.408
- Wait.

01:18:49.246 --> 01:18:51.208
Did you hear that?

01:18:51.208 --> 01:18:52.706
(Ben screeching)

01:18:52.706 --> 01:18:54.018
- No! No!

01:18:54.018 --> 01:18:54.851
No! No!

01:18:56.712 --> 01:18:57.545
No!

01:18:58.836 --> 01:19:00.218
(yelling)

01:19:00.218 --> 01:19:02.551
(Ben screeching)

01:19:02.551 --> 01:19:03.968
Stop it! Stop it!

01:19:06.592 --> 01:19:07.425
Fucker!

01:19:09.123 --> 01:19:10.829
(Ben screeching)

01:19:10.829 --> 01:19:12.014
(Tom yelling)

01:19:12.014 --> 01:19:13.291
Ben! Stop!

01:19:13.291 --> 01:19:14.124
(Ben screeching)

01:19:14.124 --> 01:19:15.485
Stop it, Ben!

01:19:15.485 --> 01:19:16.318
Ben!

01:19:20.558 --> 01:19:21.824
Get outside.

01:19:21.824 --> 01:19:24.320
(Ben screeching)

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:26.886
And you stay out there.

01:19:26.886 --> 01:19:29.916
(Ben whining)

01:19:29.916 --> 01:19:32.999
(footsteps stomping)

01:19:39.499 --> 01:19:42.249
(Ben screeching)

01:19:53.303 --> 01:19:55.970
Hey, has anybody got sweatpants?

01:20:00.246 --> 01:20:03.230
I want to be clean shaven for.

01:20:03.230 --> 01:20:05.598
Because I'm a business man now.

01:20:05.598 --> 01:20:08.176
- [David] Okay, whenever you're ready.

01:20:08.176 --> 01:20:09.009
- Okay.

01:20:12.297 --> 01:20:13.934
Hi, I'm Tom Riley.

01:20:13.934 --> 01:20:16.837
I'm here in front of my former
home on Steelmanville Road

01:20:16.837 --> 01:20:18.427
where I fought and beat the evil

01:20:18.427 --> 01:20:20.018
that had taken up residence

01:20:20.018 --> 01:20:21.121
and I can help you.

01:20:21.121 --> 01:20:21.954
- [David] Cut.

01:20:21.954 --> 01:20:22.787
- What? Why?

01:20:22.787 --> 01:20:25.045
- [David] The commercial's
only 30 seconds long.

01:20:25.045 --> 01:20:26.311
You don't have to say your name.

01:20:26.311 --> 01:20:28.354
We'll have it displayed on screen.

01:20:28.354 --> 01:20:29.782
- I don't say my name?

01:20:29.782 --> 01:20:31.860
- [David] No, it's going
to be up on the screen

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:33.288
with your phone number.

01:20:33.288 --> 01:20:35.773
- What if a blind person
is hearing the spot on TV

01:20:35.773 --> 01:20:37.201
and they have a ghost?

01:20:37.201 --> 01:20:38.060
What about that?

01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:39.569
They need to hear my name.

01:20:39.569 --> 01:20:41.125
I need to say my name.

01:20:41.125 --> 01:20:43.412
- [David] You won't be able
to fit it all in 30 seconds.

01:20:43.412 --> 01:20:46.396
- Yes I will, just let me do my thing.

01:20:46.396 --> 01:20:48.242
- [David] Okay.

01:20:48.242 --> 01:20:49.879
Take two.

01:20:49.879 --> 01:20:51.342
- Hi, I'm Tom Riley.

01:20:51.342 --> 01:20:54.198
I'm here in front of my former
home on Steelmanville Road

01:20:54.198 --> 01:20:55.951
where I fought and beat the evil

01:20:55.951 --> 01:20:57.785
that had taken up residence

01:20:57.785 --> 01:21:00.363
and I can help you rid
your home of evil too.

01:21:00.363 --> 01:21:03.021
Are you experiencing
weird noises in your home?

01:21:03.021 --> 01:21:05.018
Are doors opening and shutting?

01:21:05.018 --> 01:21:06.771
Are things moving?

01:21:06.771 --> 01:21:09.314
Do you experience changes in temperatures?

01:21:09.314 --> 01:21:10.661
Strange smells?

01:21:10.661 --> 01:21:12.124
Do you hear voices?

01:21:12.124 --> 01:21:15.560
Take it from me, don't think you're crazy.

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:19.194
You may be the victim of
ghosts or demonic spirits

01:21:19.194 --> 01:21:22.062
that want to drive you from your home.

01:21:22.062 --> 01:21:23.199
I can help.

01:21:23.199 --> 01:21:25.115
Call me to schedule a free

01:21:25.115 --> 01:21:27.820
no obligation consultation

01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:30.758
where I will personally come to your home

01:21:30.758 --> 01:21:32.836
and evaluate your situation.

01:21:32.836 --> 01:21:35.062
I will put your mind at ease

01:21:35.062 --> 01:21:38.046
and help return peace to your home.

01:21:38.046 --> 01:21:39.346
Call today.

01:21:39.346 --> 01:21:40.179
Thank you.

01:21:41.064 --> 01:21:42.051
How was that?

01:21:42.051 --> 01:21:43.769
- [David] It was a minute.

01:21:43.769 --> 01:21:45.522
- Your ass, that was 30 seconds.

01:21:45.522 --> 01:21:47.275
- [David] It was a minute, Tom.

01:21:47.275 --> 01:21:48.108
- Fuck.

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:50.900
Okay, do it again.

01:21:52.047 --> 01:21:53.797
- [David] Take three.

01:21:55.437 --> 01:21:57.353
- Do you have a ghost problem?

01:21:57.353 --> 01:21:59.849
Are evil spirits destroying
the peace in your home

01:21:59.849 --> 01:22:01.115
or place of work?

01:22:01.115 --> 01:22:02.334
I can help you.

01:22:02.334 --> 01:22:04.098
I've been through it myself.

01:22:04.098 --> 01:22:07.732
The first step in ridding your
life of malevolent spirits

01:22:07.732 --> 01:22:11.784
is to call me for a free
no obligation consultation.

01:22:11.784 --> 01:22:13.537
You'll be glad you did.

01:22:13.537 --> 01:22:15.453
End the harassment today.

01:22:15.453 --> 01:22:18.878
I am the solution to what
goes bump in the night.

01:22:18.878 --> 01:22:20.190
I'm here for you.

01:22:20.190 --> 01:22:21.328
Thank you.

01:22:21.328 --> 01:22:24.328
(music box chiming)

01:22:31.010 --> 01:22:34.177
(exciting rock music)

01:23:48.742 --> 01:23:51.659
(computer chiming)

01:23:56.579 --> 01:23:57.600
- Hey, Tom.

01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:00.573
My name's Danny and
this is my wife, Laura.

01:24:00.573 --> 01:24:02.291
We're sending you this video

01:24:02.291 --> 01:24:05.832
in the hopes that you can
help is with a problem.

01:24:05.832 --> 01:24:08.688
We heard about what happened
at Steelmanville Road

01:24:08.688 --> 01:24:10.360
and your house over there

01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:11.753
and the things that you went through.

01:24:11.753 --> 01:24:15.213
But we also heard about how
you were helping people like us

01:24:15.213 --> 01:24:17.372
with the issues we've been having lately.

01:24:17.372 --> 01:24:20.518
We've had some unexplainable
things happen here

01:24:20.518 --> 01:24:22.434
that we just can't explain.

01:24:22.434 --> 01:24:25.499
There's been things moving off of shelves.

01:24:25.499 --> 01:24:28.216
Things disappearing and maybe
that's supernatural or not,

01:24:28.216 --> 01:24:29.075
I don't know.

01:24:29.075 --> 01:24:30.631
I don't really believe that.

01:24:30.631 --> 01:24:31.687
The biggest problem

01:24:31.687 --> 01:24:34.021
or the thing that scares me the most

01:24:34.021 --> 01:24:35.688
is this dark figure,

01:24:36.772 --> 01:24:40.070
dark presence that's been near us.

01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:41.672
- There's some bad vibes here.

01:24:41.672 --> 01:24:43.855
- That's just been around us for weeks now

01:24:43.855 --> 01:24:45.654
and I don't know where it's coming from

01:24:45.654 --> 01:24:47.535
or what it means.

01:24:47.535 --> 01:24:50.136
All I know is that maybe
you're the only one

01:24:50.136 --> 01:24:51.564
that can help us.
http://worldmkv.com/

01:24:51.564 --> 01:24:54.564
So, Tom Riley, you're our only hope.

01:24:55.639 --> 01:24:58.806
