TRUMP MADE HIS FINAL ARGUMENT TO

01:00.800 --> 01:01.834
HIS BASE, OCCASIONALLY VEERING

01:01.900 --> 01:02.367
OFF MESSAGE, LIKE WHEN HE

01:02.433 --> 01:02.867
SUDDENLY BROUGHT UP THE

THAT DOES ACTUALLY KIND OF

01:25.400 --> 01:26.467
TRUMP HAS FAILED UPWARD FOR

01:26.533 --> 01:27.567
72 STRAIGHT YEARS.

01:27.633 --> 01:28.934

01:29.000 --> 01:29.567
WHEN TRUMP FINDS HIMSELF AT THE

01:29.633 --> 01:30.700
PEARLY GATES, THERE'S A NON-ZERO

01:30.767 --> 01:32.033
CHANCE THAT HE'LL GET IN, MARRY

01:32.100 --> 01:33.567
THREE HOT ANGELS, AND BE ELECTED

01:33.633 --> 01:35.934
THE NEXT GOD.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.233
NOW, THIS CAMPAIGN, AT EVERY

01:37.333 --> 01:38.133
LEVEL, HAS BEEN EXCEPTIONAL FOR

01:38.200 --> 01:39.834
ITS NEGATIVITY.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.233
TAKE CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN

01:41.300 --> 01:43.000
DUNCAN HUNTER, WHO GAINED

01:43.066 --> 01:44.367
NOTORIETY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO

01:44.433 --> 01:46.300
FOR VAPING IN A CONGRESSIONAL

01:46.367 --> 01:47.633
HEARING, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT

01:47.700 --> 01:49.500
YOU'D EXPECT A CONGRESSMAN NAMED

01:49.567 --> 01:51.834
"DUNCAN HUNTER" TO DO.

01:51.900 --> 01:53.367
HUNTER THEN WENT EXTREMELY

01:53.433 --> 01:54.300
NEGATIVE DURING HIS CAMPAIGN IN

01:54.367 --> 01:55.500
AN ATTACK AD AGAINST HIS

01:55.567 --> 01:56.600
OPPONENT.

01:56.667 --> 01:57.433
>> AMMAR CAMPA-NAJJAR IS WORKING

01:57.500 --> 01:58.500
TO INFILTRATE CONGRESS.

01:58.567 --> 01:59.467
HE'S USED THREE DIFFERENT NAMES

01:59.533 --> 02:00.300
TO HIDE HIS FAMILY'S TIES TO

02:00.367 --> 02:06.000
TERRORISM.

02:06.066 --> 02:07.133
HIS GRANDFATHER MASTERMINDED THE

02:07.200 --> 02:07.633
MUNICH OLYMPIC MASSACRE.

02:07.667 --> 02:08.500
>> HE IS BEING SUPPORTED BY CAIR

02:08.567 --> 02:09.834
AND THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.

02:09.900 --> 02:10.400
THIS IS A WELL-ORCHESTRATED

02:10.467 --> 02:11.333
PLAN.

02:11.400 --> 02:12.767
>> AMMAR CAMPA-NAJJAR, A RISK WE

02:12.834 --> 02:14.467
CAN'T IGNORE.

02:14.533 --> 02:15.967
>> John: OKAY, SO THERE IS A LOT

02:16.033 --> 02:17.867
TO UNPACK THERE, BUT LET'S START

02:17.934 --> 02:21.400
WITH THE FACT THAT YOU'RE

02:21.467 --> 02:22.734
ARGUING THAT THIS GUY CHANGED

02:22.800 --> 02:23.867
HIS NAME MULTIPLE TIMES SO THAT

02:23.934 --> 02:24.500
AMERICANS WOULDN'T ASSOCIATE HIM

02:24.567 --> 02:25.700
WITH TERRORISM AND LANDED ON

02:25.767 --> 02:26.867
"AMMAR CAMPA

02:26.934 --> 02:28.934
YOU'D HAVE THOUGHT HE WOULD GO

02:29.000 --> 02:30.100
WITH SOMETHING SAFER, LIKE

02:30.166 --> 02:31.633
"JAMES WONDERBREAD" OR

02:31.700 --> 02:32.867
"BENJAMIN AMERICAFACE" OR

02:32.934 --> 02:34.133
SOMETHING THAT REALLY PLAYS TO

02:34.200 --> 02:35.300
THE ISLAMOPHOBIC CROWD, LIKE

02:35.367 --> 02:37.967
"DUNCAN HUNTER."

02:38.033 --> 02:39.033
AND I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH

02:39.100 --> 02:44.000
EVERYTHING UNTRUE IN THAT AD.

02:44.066 --> 02:44.734
SUFFICE TO SAY THAT

02:44.800 --> 02:46.166
"THE WASHINGTON POST" GAVE IT

02:46.233 --> 02:46.967
A RATING OF "FOUR PINOCCHIOS,"

02:47.033 --> 02:47.734
ALTHOUGH I'M SURPRISED IT DIDN'T

02:47.800 --> 02:48.700
GET JUST ONE PINOCCHIO THAT HUNG

02:48.767 --> 02:49.567
ITSELF WITH A SUICIDE NOTE

02:49.633 --> 02:50.433
SAYING "I HAVE SEEN WHAT YOUR

02:50.500 --> 02:51.266
WORLD HAS TO OFFER THOSE WHO ARE

02:51.333 --> 02:51.934
DIFFERENT AND I NO LONGER WISH

02:52.000 --> 02:55.200
TO BE A REAL BOY IN IT."

02:55.266 --> 02:56.600
AND IT IS HARD TO CALL

02:56.667 --> 02:57.934
CAMPA-NAJJAR A SECURITY THREAT

02:58.000 --> 02:59.200
WHEN HE HAD A SECURITY CLEARANCE

02:59.266 --> 03:00.200
FOR HIS PAST WORK IN THE OBAMA

03:00.266 --> 03:02.533
WHITE HOUSE.

03:02.600 --> 03:03.734
WHICH, FOR THE RECORD, IS

03:03.800 --> 03:05.467
SOMETHING THAT CLOUD CHASER OVER

03:05.533 --> 03:07.500
HERE PROBABLY COULDN'T GET

03:07.567 --> 03:09.000
'CAUSE HE AND HIS WIFE ARE

03:09.066 --> 03:10.000
CURRENTLY UNDER INDICTMENT FOR

03:10.066 --> 03:11.100
ILLEGALLY USING $250,000 OF

03:11.166 --> 03:13.000
CAMPAIGN FUNDS ON PERSONAL

03:13.066 --> 03:14.200
EXPENSES.

03:14.266 --> 03:15.567
NOW, THEY HAVE PLED NOT GUILTY,

03:15.633 --> 03:17.266
BUT THE INDICTMENT ITSELF IS

03:17.333 --> 03:18.967
INCREDIBLE, ALLEGING

03:19.033 --> 03:20.867
HUNTER SPENT $14,000 ON A FAMILY

03:20.934 --> 03:23.300
VACATION TO ITALY, $462 FOR

03:23.367 --> 03:25.166
30 SHOTS OF TEQUILA AND

03:25.233 --> 03:27.533
ONE STEAK AT A BACHELOR PARTY,

03:27.600 --> 03:30.567
$835 ON "RIVERDANCE" TICKETS,

03:30.633 --> 03:32.300
AND $250 TO FLY A FAMILY PET,

03:32.367 --> 03:34.500
A RABBIT, TO WASHINGTON, D.C.,

03:34.567 --> 03:36.367
WHICH IS BASICALLY JUST A

03:36.400 --> 03:38.967
$250 WAY TO FREAK YOUR RABBIT

03:39.033 --> 03:40.734
THE FUCK OUT.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.934
IT'S A BURROWING HERBIVORE.

03:43.000 --> 03:43.533
NO PART OF IT IS JAZZED TO BE

03:43.600 --> 03:45.333
LAUNCHED INTO THE SKY.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.233
YOU THINK YOUR EARS POP?

03:47.300 --> 03:48.266
YOU DON'T KNOW SHIT!

03:48.333 --> 03:49.367
YOU DON'T KNOW SHIT ABOUT

03:49.433 --> 03:52.767
POPPING EARS!

03:52.834 --> 03:54.367
NOW, THINGS HAVE ALSO BEEN SPICY

03:54.433 --> 03:55.800
IN IOWA'S FOURTH, WHERE

03:55.867 --> 03:58.433
CONGRESSMAN STEVE KING, WHO HAS

03:58.500 --> 04:00.166
A HISTORY OF FLIRTING WITH

04:00.233 --> 04:02.033
WHITE NATIONALISTS, HAS GOTTEN

04:02.100 --> 04:05.700
IN HOT WATER FOR, AMONG OTHER

04:05.767 --> 04:07.800
THINGS, MEETING WITH AN AUSTRIAN

04:07.867 --> 04:09.133
PARTY FOUNDED BY AN SS OFFICER

04:09.200 --> 04:09.734
IN AUGUST.

04:09.800 --> 04:10.400
AND WHEN ASKED ABOUT THAT THIS

04:10.467 --> 04:11.100
WEEK, HE DID NOT TAKE IT WELL.

04:11.166 --> 04:12.133
>> IF YOU DON'T HAVE A

04:12.200 --> 04:12.700
WHITE SUPREMACIST WORLDVIEW,

04:12.767 --> 04:13.233
THEN WHY DID YOU TRAVEL TO

04:13.300 --> 04:14.233
AUSTRIA AND MEET WITH A

04:14.300 --> 04:14.867
WHITE SUPREMACIST ORGANIZATION?

04:14.934 --> 04:15.533
>> THIS IS OVER IF YOU DON'T

04:15.600 --> 04:16.233
STOP TALKING.

04:16.300 --> 04:17.033
I'M LEAVING --

04:17.100 --> 04:17.800
>> I THINK -- NO, I THINK HE'S

04:17.867 --> 04:18.533
GIVEN HIS ANSWER.

04:18.600 --> 04:19.433
I THINK THAT, THAT -- HIS ANSWER

04:19.500 --> 04:20.367
IS HIS ANSWER.

04:20.433 --> 04:21.100
>> BUT DO YOU IDENTIFY AS A

04:21.166 --> 04:22.100
WHITE SUPREMACIST?

04:22.166 --> 04:23.300
>> STOP IT!

04:23.367 --> 04:24.900
>> John: "STOP IT!"

04:24.967 --> 04:28.533
THAT IS A SPECTACULAR WHIFF WHEN

04:28.600 --> 04:29.900
THE QUESTION IS SIMPLY "ARE YOU

04:29.967 --> 04:34.233
A WHITE SUPREMACIST?"

04:34.300 --> 04:36.533
PEOPLE WHO AREN'T A

04:36.600 --> 04:37.266
WHITE SUPREMACIST SAY "NO."

04:37.333 --> 04:37.967
EVEN PEOPLE WHO ARE

04:38.033 --> 04:39.000
WHITE SUPREMACISTS KNOW TO SAY

04:39.066 --> 04:39.300
"NO."

04:39.367 --> 04:40.066
SO IT TAKES A SPECIAL MIX OF

04:40.133 --> 04:41.233
RACISM AND STUPID TO FUCK THAT

04:41.300 --> 04:41.734
ONE UP.

04:41.800 --> 04:42.767
KING HAS SINCE LOST A NUMBER OF

04:42.834 --> 04:43.433
SUPPORTERS, INCLUDING THE

04:43.500 --> 04:44.800
CORPORATE PACs OF LAND O'LAKES,

04:44.867 --> 04:46.734
PURINA, AND OUR PARENT COMPANY,

04:46.800 --> 04:47.333
AT&T, WHICH IS A LITTLE WEIRD,

04:47.400 --> 04:48.100
BECAUSE KING HAS BEEN PRETTY

04:48.166 --> 04:49.333
MUCH EXACTLY THIS RACIST FOR

04:49.400 --> 04:51.600
YEARS NOW, INCLUDING ONCE

04:51.667 --> 04:53.033
TWEETING "CULTURE AND

04:53.100 --> 04:54.867
DEMOGRAPHICS ARE OUR DESTINY.

04:54.934 --> 04:56.100
WE CAN'T RESTORE OUR

04:56.166 --> 04:57.266
CIVILIZATION WITH SOMEBODY

04:57.333 --> 04:59.734
ELSE'S BABIES."

04:59.800 --> 05:01.233
EVEN NEO-NAZI WEBSITE

05:01.300 --> 05:02.200
"DAILY STORMER" HAS SAID, AND I

05:02.266 --> 05:03.367
QUOTE, "STEVE KING IS BASICALLY

05:03.433 --> 05:04.867
AN OPEN WHITE NATIONALIST AT

05:04.967 --> 05:06.900
THIS POINT."

05:06.967 --> 05:08.667
SO THE NEWS REALLY SHOULDN'T BE

05:08.734 --> 05:09.967
"THESE COMPANIES BAILED ON HIM"

05:10.033 --> 05:11.567
SO MUCH AS "THEY WERE OKAY WITH

05:11.633 --> 05:14.400
HIM FOR A SHOCKINGLY LONG TIME."

05:14.467 --> 05:15.367
ALTHOUGH, OF COURSE AT&T

05:15.433 --> 05:16.667
DIDN'T CATCH ON TO KING'S

05:16.734 --> 05:17.500
WHITE NATIONALISM.

05:17.567 --> 05:18.800
PICKING UP ON CLEAR SIGNALS

05:18.867 --> 05:19.800
ISN'T EXACTLY THEIR FORTE.

05:19.867 --> 05:20.800
HOW YOU LIKE THEM APPLES,

05:20.867 --> 05:22.433
BUSINESS DADDY?

05:22.500 --> 05:24.000
HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?

05:24.066 --> 05:25.500
I BET YOU DON'T LIKE THOSE

05:25.567 --> 05:27.467
APPLES, DO YOU?

05:27.533 --> 05:29.266
AND ALL THAT TOXICITY MAKES YOU

05:29.333 --> 05:30.567
GRATEFUL FOR THE GLORIOUS

05:30.633 --> 05:31.567
SILLINESS OF WHAT HAPPENED THIS

05:31.633 --> 05:32.700
WEEK IN NEBRASKA'S

05:32.767 --> 05:35.900
FIRST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT.

05:35.967 --> 05:38.233
>> A UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA

05:38.300 --> 05:38.900
PROFESSOR SAYS HE'S BEEN

05:38.967 --> 05:39.767
THREATENED BY U.S. CONGRESSMAN

05:39.834 --> 05:41.066
JEFF FORTENBERRY'S CAMPAIGN

05:41.133 --> 05:41.700
MANAGER AFTER LIKING A PICTURE

05:41.767 --> 05:42.233
ON FACEBOOK.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.900
>> THIS IS THAT PICTURE.

05:44.967 --> 05:47.100
>> John: IT IS TRUE.

05:47.166 --> 05:48.800
SOMEBODY PUT GOOGLY EYES ON

05:48.867 --> 05:50.767
JEFF FORTENBERRY'S CAMPAIGN SIGN

05:50.834 --> 05:51.900
AND CHANGED IT TO READ

05:51.967 --> 05:53.400
"JEFF FARTENBERRY."

05:53.467 --> 05:54.867
AND LOOK, I DON'T KNOW IF BANKSY

05:54.934 --> 05:55.967
IS GETTING BETTER OR WORSE, BUT

05:56.033 --> 05:58.500
HE'S DEFINITELY CHANGED.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.400
NOW, APPARENTLY FARTENBERRY WAS

06:00.467 --> 06:02.233
VERY UPSET ABOUT THIS SIGN, AND

06:02.300 --> 06:03.767
HIS CHIEF OF STAFF, REYN ARCHER,

06:03.834 --> 06:05.200
MASSIVELY OVERREACTED, TO THE

06:05.266 --> 06:07.000
POINT WHERE HE CALLED A LOCAL

06:07.066 --> 06:08.800
PROFESSOR NAMED ARI KOHEN TO

06:08.867 --> 06:10.467
COMPLAIN BECAUSE KOHEN HAD

06:10.533 --> 06:11.300
SIMPLY LIKED THAT IMAGE ON

06:11.367 --> 06:12.667
FACEBOOK.

06:12.734 --> 06:13.734
KOHEN ACTUALLY RECORDED THAT

06:13.800 --> 06:15.233
CALL, AND IT'S AMAZING.

06:15.300 --> 06:15.834
>> WHAT YOU'RE LIKING IS

06:15.900 --> 06:17.033
VANDALISM.

06:17.100 --> 06:18.433
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

06:18.500 --> 06:19.333
>> YES, IT IS.

06:19.400 --> 06:20.266
>> IT --

06:21.300 --> 06:23.233
I'M LIKING A PHOTO.

06:23.300 --> 06:24.100
>> YOU'RE LIKING -- WHAT THE

06:24.166 --> 06:26.867
PHOTO REPRESENTS IS VANDALISM.

06:26.934 --> 06:27.867
>> BUT --

06:27.934 --> 06:29.867
>> IF -- IF SOMEONE WERE LIKING

06:29.934 --> 06:31.333
SOMETHING WITH BLACKFACE, WOULD

06:31.400 --> 06:32.567
THAT BE ACCEPTABLE?

06:32.633 --> 06:35.266
>> John: WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT

06:35.333 --> 06:36.467
WAIT.

06:36.533 --> 06:37.333
I THINK I ACTUALLY KNOW THE

06:37.400 --> 06:37.900
ANSWER THIS ONE: NO.

06:37.967 --> 06:38.934
BLACKFACE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.233
OH, GOD, I JUST WON!

06:41.300 --> 06:41.867
I WON!

06:41.934 --> 06:42.600
I WON!

06:42.667 --> 06:43.734
I'M REPLACING MEGYN KELLY ON THE

06:43.800 --> 06:44.900
"TODAY SHOW"!

06:44.967 --> 06:46.300
THAT'S ALL IT TOOK!

06:46.367 --> 06:47.867
WHAT AN INCREDIBLY EASY STANDARD

06:47.934 --> 06:49.333
TO MEET!

06:49.400 --> 06:50.633
THANK YOU SO MUCH,

06:50.700 --> 06:52.300
PERSONIFICATION OF NBC!

06:52.367 --> 06:53.300
THANK YOU.

06:53.367 --> 06:54.433
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

06:54.500 --> 06:55.867
IT'S LOVELY TO SEE YOU.

06:55.934 --> 06:57.367
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

06:57.433 --> 06:58.800
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

06:58.867 --> 06:59.900
WAIT.

06:59.967 --> 07:01.700
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

07:01.767 --> 07:03.633
NO, NO, NO.

07:03.700 --> 07:04.400
I'M NOT GOING TO BE

07:04.467 --> 07:05.433
THAT KIND OF "TODAY SHOW" HOST.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.400
NO, NO, NO.

07:07.467 --> 07:08.200
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A

07:08.266 --> 07:11.200
LOT, HAVEN'T YOU?

07:12.900 --> 07:13.867
YOU'VE REALLY BEEN THROUGH A

07:13.934 --> 07:15.734
LOT.

07:15.800 --> 07:16.367
JUST GO HOME.

07:16.433 --> 07:17.633
JUST TRY TO GET SOME REST.

07:17.700 --> 07:18.767
IT SOUNDS ROUGH OVER THERE.

07:18.834 --> 07:19.500
THE PEACOCK, LADIES AND

07:19.567 --> 07:20.200
GENTLEMAN.

07:20.266 --> 07:20.967
TOUGH PLACE TO WORK

07:21.033 --> 07:25.166
HISTORICALLY.

07:25.233 --> 07:27.233
STILL, I WILL SAY THIS: LIKING

07:27.300 --> 07:30.133
THIS SIGN IS ACTUALLY EXACTLY

07:30.200 --> 07:30.900
THE SAME AS LIKING A PHOTO

07:30.967 --> 07:32.567
INVOLVING BLACKFACE, BECAUSE

07:32.633 --> 07:34.066
SIGNS LIKE THESE COME OUT OF A

07:34.133 --> 07:34.967
VERY RACIST TRADITION, EVOKING

07:35.033 --> 07:36.834
OFFENSIVE STEREOTYPES THAT ALL

07:36.900 --> 07:37.567
WHITE PEOPLE HAVE BIG GOOGLY

07:37.633 --> 07:38.934
EYES AND FART ALL THE TIME,

07:39.000 --> 07:40.133
WHICH IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.767
ONLY SOME WHITE PEOPLE HAVE BIG

07:41.834 --> 07:43.166
GOOGLY EYES AND FART ALL THE

07:43.233 --> 07:44.567
TIME, LIKE PAUL McFARTNEY,

07:44.633 --> 07:46.066
FARTIN SHEEN, JIMMY FARTER,

07:46.133 --> 07:48.433
MELISSA JOAN FART, DOLLY FARTON,

07:48.500 --> 07:51.133
AND, OF COURSE, FART.

07:51.200 --> 07:51.967
BUT THAT'S IT.

07:52.033 --> 07:54.133
THOSE ARE THE ONLY EXAMPLES.

07:54.200 --> 07:55.867
YOU KNOW WHAT THOUGH?

07:55.934 --> 07:57.100
I THINK MY FAVORITE PART OF

07:57.166 --> 07:58.367
THE CALL CAME WHEN FORTENFARTY'S

07:58.433 --> 07:59.967
CHIEF OF STAFF TRIED TO PRESSURE

08:00.033 --> 08:01.734
THE PROFESSOR BY THREATENING TO

08:01.800 --> 08:02.700
TAKE HIS CASE TO THE PUBLIC, AND

08:02.767 --> 08:03.633
THE PROFESSOR, TO HIS CREDIT,

08:03.700 --> 08:05.133
TRIED TO DISSUADE HIM.

08:05.200 --> 08:06.367
>> FRANKLY, WE HAVE A

08:06.433 --> 08:07.900
FIRST AMENDMENT OPPORTUNITY TO

08:07.967 --> 08:09.133
BASICALLY PUT YOU OUT THERE IN

08:09.200 --> 08:11.533
FRONT OF EVERYBODY AND EVEN

08:11.600 --> 08:12.900
PUT -- PUT THIS CLEARLY AS,

08:12.967 --> 08:14.834
"WHY IS A PROFESSOR LIKING

08:14.900 --> 08:16.800
VANDALISM?"

08:16.867 --> 08:18.700
WE CAN DO THAT PUBLICLY.

08:18.767 --> 08:20.000
WOULD YOU LIKE THAT?

08:20.066 --> 08:21.233
>> I THINK IT'D BE --

08:21.300 --> 08:22.333
>> THAT'S OUR FIRST AMENDMENT

08:22.400 --> 08:22.934
RIGHT TOO.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.066
>> I -- I THINK IT'D BE A

08:24.133 --> 08:25.433
TERRIBLE IDEA FOR YOU, IF I'M

08:25.500 --> 08:27.133
BEING PERFECTLY HONEST, AS A --

08:27.200 --> 08:27.567
>> NO.

08:27.633 --> 08:29.600
HOW SO?

08:29.667 --> 08:31.000
>> BECAUSE THE -- BECAUSE THE

08:31.066 --> 08:32.900
OPTICS OF THIS ARE TERRIBLE.

08:32.967 --> 08:33.900
>> John: YES.

08:33.967 --> 08:35.500
THEY ARE.

08:35.567 --> 08:37.633
THEY ARE.

08:37.700 --> 08:38.633
IF YOU'RE ARGUING THAT

08:38.700 --> 08:40.233
IT'S WRONG FOR ANYONE TO LIKE

08:40.300 --> 08:41.567
"JEFF FARTENBERRY," I DON'T

08:41.633 --> 08:44.800
THINK YOU'RE GOING TO FIND A

08:44.867 --> 08:51.300
GROUNDSWELL OF PUBLIC SUPPORT

08:51.367 --> 08:51.867
FOR THAT OPINION,

08:51.934 --> 08:52.600
BECAUSE IN AN ELECTION SEASON

08:52.667 --> 08:53.433
FEATURING A VAPING DOUCHE AND

08:53.500 --> 08:54.100
SOMEONE SO RACIST THAT BUTTER

08:54.166 --> 08:54.800
HAD TO WEIGH IN, THIS MIGHT

08:54.867 --> 08:55.967
ACTUALLY BE THE BEST OPTICS THAT

08:56.033 --> 08:56.533
YOU COULD POSSIBLY HOPE FOR.

08:56.600 --> 08:57.467
AND NOW THIS.

08:57.533 --> 08:58.400
>> Announcer: AND NOW, OUR

08:58.467 --> 08:59.233
ANNUAL CHECK-IN WITH THE

08:59.300 --> 09:00.300
CONSEQUENCES OF COMBINING

09:00.367 --> 09:02.600
LOCAL NEWS SHOWS AND HALLOWEEN.

09:02.667 --> 09:03.934
>> HAPPY HALLOWEEN!

09:04.000 --> 09:05.333
>> GOOD MORNING!

09:07.800 --> 09:09.433
>> DRACULA RUNS ON DUNKIN'.

09:09.500 --> 09:11.166
>> YES.

09:11.233 --> 09:12.700
>> WITH EXTRA BLOOD.

09:12.767 --> 09:14.100
>> YES.

09:14.166 --> 09:16.266
>> HAPPY HALLOWEEN!

09:16.333 --> 09:17.800
>> YES, IT'S TURTLE POWER ALL

09:17.867 --> 09:19.400
MORNING LONG HERE.

09:19.467 --> 09:24.033
>> WELL, EVERYBODY WANTS TO HAVE

09:24.100 --> 09:24.667
THE YARD AND THE GARDEN THAT IS

09:24.734 --> 09:25.800
THE ENVY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

09:25.867 --> 09:26.767
>> I BROUGHT YOU A TREAT TOO.

09:26.834 --> 09:27.066
>> YOU DID?

09:27.133 --> 09:29.967
>> A DOGGY TREAT.

09:30.033 --> 09:30.533
>> OH.

09:30.600 --> 09:31.300
>> WE PUT THIS TOGETHER ON THE

09:31.400 --> 09:31.867
CHEAP.

09:31.967 --> 09:32.633
>> YES.

09:32.700 --> 09:33.567
>> BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A CHEAP

09:33.633 --> 09:33.800
BUDGET.

09:33.867 --> 09:38.800
>> LOOK AT US.

09:38.867 --> 09:39.867
AS FRED AND VELMA?

09:39.934 --> 09:40.633
WILMA?

09:40.700 --> 09:41.533
>> NO, I'M DAPHNE.

09:41.600 --> 09:42.100
>> YOU LOOK SO CUTE IN YOUR

09:42.166 --> 09:42.700
BUNNY OUTFIT.

09:42.767 --> 09:43.533
>> THE SCARY CREDIT CARD MISTAKE

09:43.600 --> 09:44.533
THAT MOST CONSUMERS MAKE IS

09:44.600 --> 09:45.700
COMING UP NEXT.

09:45.767 --> 09:46.900
>> NOW, ACCORDING TO THE

09:46.967 --> 09:48.066
NATIONAL SAFETY COUNCIL, WE'RE

09:48.133 --> 09:49.600
GOING TO -- CHILDREN ARE MORE

09:49.667 --> 09:50.633
THAN TWICE AS LIKELY TO GET HIT

09:50.700 --> 09:51.734
BY A CAR ON HALLOWEEN THAN ANY

09:51.800 --> 09:55.100
OTHER DAY OF THE YEAR.

09:55.166 --> 09:56.600
>> John: MOVING ON.

09:56.667 --> 09:58.367
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

09:58.433 --> 09:59.467
IMMIGRATION, THE SYSTEM THAT

09:59.533 --> 10:01.300
BROUGHT YOU ME.

10:01.333 --> 10:02.100
BUT IT'S STILL GOOD AND I

10:02.166 --> 10:04.600
PROMISE THAT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

10:04.667 --> 10:06.367
IMMIGRATION HAS BEEN DOMINATING

10:06.433 --> 10:07.467
THE NEWS ALL WEEK LONG AS A

10:07.533 --> 10:09.100
CARAVAN OF MIGRANTS FROM

10:09.166 --> 10:09.700
CENTRAL AMERICA CONTINUES TO

10:09.767 --> 10:11.533
HEAD NORTH, AND DESPITE IT BEING

10:11.600 --> 10:12.400
A THOUSAND MILES AND POSSIBLY

10:12.467 --> 10:14.000
MONTHS AWAY, TRUMP HAS MADE IT A

10:14.066 --> 10:15.300
CENTERPIECE OF HIS CLOSING

10:15.367 --> 10:16.567
ARGUMENT HEADING INTO THE

10:16.633 --> 10:18.533
MIDTERMS.

10:18.600 --> 10:19.467
>> AT THIS VERY MOMENT, LARGE,

10:19.533 --> 10:20.767
WELL-ORGANIZED CARAVANS OF

10:20.834 --> 10:22.600
MIGRANTS ARE MARCHING TOWARDS

10:22.667 --> 10:24.900
OUR SOUTHERN BORDER.

10:24.967 --> 10:27.166
SOME PEOPLE CALL IT AN INVASION.

10:27.233 --> 10:29.433
IT'S LIKE AN INVASION.

10:29.500 --> 10:32.100
A LOT OF YOUNG MEN, STRONG MEN.

10:32.166 --> 10:33.500
AND A LOT OF MEN THAT MAYBE WE

10:33.567 --> 10:34.467
DON'T WANT IN OUR COUNTRY.

10:34.533 --> 10:35.533
I DON'T WANT THEM IN OUR

10:35.600 --> 10:36.767
COUNTRY.

10:36.834 --> 10:38.133
AND WOMEN DON'T WANT THEM IN OUR

10:38.200 --> 10:38.633
COUNTRY.

10:38.700 --> 10:39.834
WOMEN WANT SECURITY.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.367
MEN DON'T WANT THEM IN OUR

10:41.433 --> 10:42.967
COUNTRY.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.367
BUT THE WOMEN DO NOT WANT THEM.

10:44.433 --> 10:45.600
WOMEN WANT SECURITY.

10:45.667 --> 10:47.567
>> John: WOW.

10:47.633 --> 10:49.333
"YOUNG STRONG MEN ARE INVADING

10:49.400 --> 10:50.600
OUR COUNTRY AND COMING FOR OUR

10:50.667 --> 10:51.734
WOMEN."

10:51.800 --> 10:53.233
THAT'S SUCH OLD-TIMEY RACISM I'M

10:53.300 --> 10:54.734
GENUINELY AMAZED THAT IMAGE

10:54.800 --> 10:56.266
DIDN'T TURN BLACK AND WHITE AS

10:56.333 --> 10:57.467
HE TALKED, LIKE "PLEASANTVILLE"

10:57.533 --> 10:59.000
IN REVERSE.

10:59.066 --> 11:00.233
NOW, THIS WEEK, TRUMP HAS BEEN

11:00.300 --> 11:01.500
THREATENING IMMIGRATION ACTIONS

11:01.567 --> 11:02.734
RANGING FROM SENDING 15,000

11:02.800 --> 11:04.000
TROOPS TO THE BORDER TO ENDING

11:04.066 --> 11:05.467
BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP.

11:05.533 --> 11:06.867
AND LOOK, IT IS HARD TO KNOW

11:06.934 --> 11:07.500
WHAT THE PRESIDENT WILL, OR EVEN

11:07.567 --> 11:09.200
CAN, DO GOING FORWARD.

11:09.266 --> 11:10.433
SO TONIGHT, INSTEAD OF FOCUSING

11:10.500 --> 11:11.533
ON HYPOTHETICALS, I THOUGHT IT

11:11.600 --> 11:13.066
MIGHT BE USEFUL TO LOOK

11:13.133 --> 11:15.000
BACKWARDS AT SOMETHING HE

11:15.066 --> 11:15.834
ABSOLUTELY DID DO CONCERNING

11:15.900 --> 11:17.700
IMMIGRANTS: FAMILY SEPARATION.

11:17.767 --> 11:18.633
IT WAS PART OF HIS

11:18.700 --> 11:19.500
"ZERO TOLERANCE" POLICY, WHERE

11:19.567 --> 11:20.800
PARENTS CROSSING THE BORDER WERE

11:20.867 --> 11:22.033
LOCKED UP, PROSECUTED, AND HAD

11:22.100 --> 11:23.533
THEIR CHILDREN TAKEN AWAY.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.633
THE STORY DOMINATED THE NEWS

11:24.700 --> 11:26.166
BACK IN JUNE WITH DISTRESSING

11:26.233 --> 11:28.300
IMAGES OF KIDS IN CAGES AND

11:28.367 --> 11:30.600
SHELTERS, MELANIA'S VERY COOL

11:30.667 --> 11:31.867
JACKET READING, "I REALLY DON'T

11:31.934 --> 11:33.100
CARE, DO YOU?" AND, OF COURSE,

11:33.166 --> 11:34.934
THIS MOMENT.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.166
>> I READ TODAY ABOUT A

11:36.233 --> 11:37.467
10-YEAR-OLD GIRL WITH

11:37.533 --> 11:38.867
DOWN SYNDROME WHO WAS TAKEN FROM

11:38.934 --> 11:39.900
HER MOTHER AND PUT IN A CAGE.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.400
>> WOMP-WOMP.

11:41.467 --> 11:42.734
>> I READ ABOUT A -- A --

11:42.800 --> 11:43.900
DID YOU SAY "WOMP-WOMP" TO A

11:43.967 --> 11:45.834
10

11:45.900 --> 11:46.633
>> John: YES, HE DID!

11:46.700 --> 11:50.567
YES.

11:50.633 --> 11:51.600
YEAH, COREY LEWANDOWSKI SAID

11:51.667 --> 11:52.333
"WOMP-WOMP," AND IF THERE'S ANY

11:52.400 --> 11:53.100
JUSTICE, THAT WILL BE CARVED

11:53.166 --> 11:54.233
ON HIS GRAVESTONE, AND WHEN HE

11:54.300 --> 11:54.867
ARRIVES AT THE PEARLY GATES, THE

11:54.934 --> 11:55.500
FIRST THING HE'LL HEAR WILL BE,

11:55.567 --> 11:55.900
"OH, HI, COREY.

11:55.967 --> 11:56.600
I'VE BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME TO

11:56.667 --> 11:57.333
SAY THIS TO YOU...

11:58.734 --> 12:03.400
WOMP-WOMP."

12:03.467 --> 12:05.367
NOW, AFTER A NATIONAL OUTCRY AND

12:05.433 --> 12:07.500
COURT CHALLENGES, THE PRESIDENT

12:07.567 --> 12:08.800
SIGNED AN ORDER REVERSING

12:08.867 --> 12:11.767
COURSE, AND THE STORY KIND OF

12:11.834 --> 12:12.500
FADED FROM THE HEADLINES.

12:12.567 --> 12:13.700
BUT IT IS REALLY WORTH

12:13.767 --> 12:14.567
REVISITING, BECAUSE A NUMBER OF

12:14.633 --> 12:15.567
GOVERNMENT REPORTS RECENTLY CAME

12:15.633 --> 12:16.800
OUT, GIVING US A MUCH CLEARER

12:16.867 --> 12:17.834
PICTURE OF WHAT WAS ACTUALLY

12:17.900 --> 12:18.633
HAPPENING.

12:18.700 --> 12:19.567
AND WHILE IT SEEMED MALICIOUS

12:19.633 --> 12:21.066
AND CHAOTIC AT THE TIME, AT

12:21.133 --> 12:22.300
EVERY STEP, IT WAS EVEN WORSE

12:22.367 --> 12:23.567
THAN YOU MIGHT ASSUME.

12:23.633 --> 12:25.100
SO LET'S LOOK AT TWO MAJOR

12:25.166 --> 12:26.767
ASPECTS OF FAMILY SEPARATION:

12:26.834 --> 12:29.500
HOW IT WAS DONE AND WHY.

12:29.600 --> 12:30.867
AND LET'S START WITH THE "HOW,"

12:30.934 --> 12:32.300
BECAUSE YOU MAY REMEMBER

12:32.367 --> 12:33.233
HEARTBREAKING STORIES OF PARENTS

12:33.300 --> 12:34.333
UNSURE WHERE THEIR CHILDREN HAD

12:34.400 --> 12:35.567
BEEN TAKEN, BUT WHEN ALEX AZAR,

12:35.633 --> 12:37.233
SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND

12:37.300 --> 12:38.400
HUMAN SERVICES, WAS ASKED ABOUT

12:38.467 --> 12:39.500
THIS, HE REASSURED EVERYONE

12:39.567 --> 12:40.600
THERE WAS NOTHING TO WORRY

12:40.667 --> 12:42.600
ABOUT.

12:42.667 --> 12:44.066
>> THERE'S NO REASON WHY ANY

12:44.133 --> 12:45.200
PARENT WOULD NOT KNOW WHERE

12:45.266 --> 12:47.066
THEIR CHILD IS LOCATED.

12:47.133 --> 12:48.633
I COULD, AT THE STROKE OF --

12:48.700 --> 12:50.533
AT KEYSTROKES -- I SAT ON THE

12:50.600 --> 12:52.533
O.R.R. PORTAL WITH JUST BASIC

12:52.600 --> 12:53.900
KEYSTROKES, WITHIN SECONDS,

12:53.967 --> 12:55.000
COULD FIND ANY CHILD IN OUR CARE

12:55.066 --> 12:58.934
FOR ANY PARENT.

12:59.033 --> 12:59.967
>> John: YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT

13:00.033 --> 13:01.133
EVERY DAY THAT YOU SEE A MAN

13:01.200 --> 13:01.667
TESTIFY WITH THE GOAL OF

13:01.734 --> 13:02.633
CONVINCING PEOPLE HE HAS ACCESS

13:02.700 --> 13:03.667
TO A LOT OF KIDS ON HIS

13:03.734 --> 13:04.500
COMPUTER.

13:04.567 --> 13:05.367
"SERIOUSLY, GUYS, JUST A FEW

13:05.433 --> 13:06.367
TAPS ON THE OL' KEYBOARD AND

13:06.433 --> 13:07.467
IT'S KID CITY ON THIS THING.

13:07.533 --> 13:08.633
PRETTY MUCH THE SECOND I OPEN MY

13:08.700 --> 13:09.967
COMPUTER, BOOM, I'M UP TO MY

13:10.033 --> 13:11.667
NECK IN CHILDREN.

13:11.734 --> 13:12.767
AND YES, I HEARD HOW THAT

13:12.834 --> 13:13.734
SOUNDS, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:13.800 --> 13:15.533
I LIKE IT."

13:15.600 --> 13:16.667
BUT WHILE AZAR MAY'VE KNOWN

13:16.734 --> 13:17.633
WHERE THE KIDS IN HIS CUSTODY

13:17.700 --> 13:18.433
WERE, THAT WAS ONLY ONE PIECE OF

13:18.533 --> 13:21.166
THE PUZZLE.

13:21.233 --> 13:22.066
THE CRITICAL INFORMATION THAT

13:22.133 --> 13:24.166
ALLOWED KIDS TO BE MATCHED WITH

13:24.233 --> 13:24.867
PARENTS WAS COMPILED BY A

13:24.934 --> 13:25.934
DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT,

13:26.000 --> 13:27.500
HOMELAND SECURITY, AND AN

13:27.567 --> 13:28.133
INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT FOUND

13:28.166 --> 13:29.233
THAT THEIR DATA WAS NOT JUST

13:29.300 --> 13:31.367
INCOMPLETE AND INCONSISTENT, BUT

13:31.433 --> 13:33.967
THAT EACH STEP OF THIS PROCESS

13:34.033 --> 13:35.467
WAS VULNERABLE TO HUMAN ERROR,

13:35.533 --> 13:37.734
INCREASING THE RISK THAT A CHILD

13:37.800 --> 13:38.300
COULD BE LOST IN THE SYSTEM,

13:38.367 --> 13:39.700
WHICH IS TERRIBLE.

13:39.767 --> 13:41.400
YOU SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO LOSE

13:41.467 --> 13:42.700
CHILDREN IN A GOVERNMENT SYSTEM

13:42.767 --> 13:44.367
AS EASILY AS IN A

13:44.433 --> 13:49.433
CHUCK E. CHEESE BALL PIT.

13:49.500 --> 13:50.400
"I'M SORRY.

13:50.467 --> 13:51.500
WE'RE GOING TO CALL OFF THE

13:51.567 --> 13:52.500
SEARCH, MRS. DONALDSON.

13:52.600 --> 13:53.633
RALPHIE'S LOST TO THE BALLS

13:53.700 --> 13:54.500
NOW."

13:54.567 --> 13:56.100
IN FACT, WHILE WE'VE BEEN TOLD

13:56.166 --> 13:57.333
THE GOVERNMENT SEPARATED AROUND

13:57.400 --> 13:57.967
2,600 CHILDREN, AND THAT AROUND

13:58.066 --> 13:59.200
230 CHILDREN ARE STILL BEING

13:59.266 --> 14:00.900
HELD AWAY FROM THEIR PARENTS, WE

14:00.967 --> 14:02.100
ACTUALLY CAN'T SAY FOR SURE

14:02.166 --> 14:03.467
WHETHER EITHER OF THOSE NUMBERS

14:03.533 --> 14:04.934
ARE ACCURATE.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.266
JUST TWO WEEKS AGO, THE

14:06.333 --> 14:08.066
GOVERNMENT APPARENTLY FOUND

14:08.133 --> 14:09.867
14 MORE CHILDREN AND ADDED THEM

14:09.934 --> 14:10.967
TO ITS TALLY.

14:11.033 --> 14:12.300
AND JUST THINK ABOUT THAT.

14:12.367 --> 14:13.867
14 CHILDREN WERE MISSING AND WE

14:13.934 --> 14:15.767
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT.

14:15.834 --> 14:17.767
HOW WAS THAT NOT A BIGGER STORY?

14:17.834 --> 14:18.734
WHEN THOSE 12 BOYS WERE STUCK IN

14:18.800 --> 14:20.300
A CAVE IN THAILAND, THERE WERE

14:20.367 --> 14:22.300
LIVE CAMERAS AND ELON MUSK WAS

14:22.367 --> 14:24.333
SENDING SUBMERSIBLES AND CALLING

14:24.400 --> 14:26.467
RESCUERS "PEDOPHILES."

14:26.533 --> 14:28.033
NOW, I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S WHAT

14:28.100 --> 14:29.367
I WANTED TO HAPPEN HERE.

14:29.433 --> 14:30.867
I DIDN'T WANT IT TO HAPPEN THEN.

14:30.934 --> 14:31.934
BUT AT LEAST PEOPLE WERE FUCKING

14:32.000 --> 14:33.633
PAYING ATTENTION.

14:33.700 --> 14:34.900
AND ALL THIS INCOMPETENCE

14:34.967 --> 14:36.166
SHOULD'VE BEEN OBVIOUS, BECAUSE

14:36.233 --> 14:37.200
WHEN NON-PROFITS TRIED TO CHECK

14:37.266 --> 14:39.166
ON THE KIDS, THE GOVERNMENT

14:39.233 --> 14:40.533
OFTEN DIDN'T HAVE A GOOD SYSTEM

14:40.600 --> 14:41.700
TO LOCATE THOSE THAT WERE LISTED

14:41.767 --> 14:44.066
AS BEING PRESENT.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.533
>> WE WERE GIVEN A LIST BY THE

14:45.600 --> 14:46.300
GOVERNMENT AND WE WERE TOLD THAT

14:46.367 --> 14:47.533
WE COULD CHOOSE WHO WE WANTED TO

14:47.600 --> 14:49.166
SPEAK TO.

14:49.233 --> 14:50.834
LOOKING THROUGH THE LIST OF OVER

14:50.900 --> 14:52.200
500 NAMES, I NOTICED THAT THERE

14:52.266 --> 14:53.100
WERE SOME VERY YOUNG CHILDREN

14:53.166 --> 14:55.467
THERE, INCLUDING A TWO-YEAR-OLD,

14:55.533 --> 14:56.900
SEVERAL ONE-YEAR-OLDS, AND ONE

14:56.967 --> 14:58.800
CHILD THAT WAS LISTED AS BEING

14:58.867 --> 15:01.233
ZERO.

15:01.300 --> 15:02.200
SO I ASKED TO SEE THOSE

15:02.266 --> 15:03.367
CHILDREN.

15:03.433 --> 15:04.266
THEY LEFT AND CAME BACK AND SAID

15:04.333 --> 15:05.300
THAT THEY COULDN'T FIND THE

15:05.367 --> 15:06.033
CHILDREN.

15:06.100 --> 15:07.000
THEY SAID TO ME, "WELL, WE

15:07.066 --> 15:07.834
CALLED OUT THEIR NAME AND NOBODY

15:07.900 --> 15:08.700
RESPONDED.

15:08.767 --> 15:09.500
SO WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY

15:09.567 --> 15:11.333
ARE."

15:11.400 --> 15:12.300
SO I -- I SORT OF SAID, WELL --

15:12.367 --> 15:13.000
>> THESE ARE BABIES.

15:13.066 --> 15:14.166
>> THEY'RE BABIES.

15:14.233 --> 15:14.633
THEY'RE BABIES.

15:14.700 --> 15:15.600
OBVIOUSLY, THEY'RE NOT GONNA

15:15.667 --> 15:16.500
RESPOND TO THEIR NAME BEING

15:16.567 --> 15:17.700
CALLED.

15:17.767 --> 15:18.800
>> John: OKAY, ANYONE WHO CALLS

15:18.867 --> 15:20.333
A BABY'S NAME AND THEN GIVES UP

15:20.400 --> 15:21.667
ON FINDING THEM EITHER KNOWS

15:21.734 --> 15:23.133
NOTHING ABOUT BABIES OR IS

15:23.200 --> 15:24.100
COVERING FOR A BABY WHO DOESN'T

15:24.166 --> 15:26.934
ACTUALLY WANT TO BE REACHED.

15:27.033 --> 15:28.066
"SORRY, SORRY, JUST TELL THEM

15:28.133 --> 15:29.533
I'M NOT IN TODAY.

15:29.600 --> 15:32.500
I'M UP TO MY DIAPER IN TRIANGLES

15:32.567 --> 15:33.133
OVER HERE AND I'VE GOT A 2:30

15:33.200 --> 15:34.066
MEETING WITH MY OWN TOES TO PREP

15:34.133 --> 15:34.867
FOR.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.066
MONDAYS, AM I RIGHT?

15:36.133 --> 15:36.967
SERIOUSLY, AM I RIGHT?

15:37.033 --> 15:38.233
I DON'T KNOW THE DAYS OF THE

15:38.300 --> 15:38.700
WEEK.

15:38.767 --> 15:39.700
I AM, AFTER ALL, A FUCKING

15:39.767 --> 15:44.467
BABY."

15:44.533 --> 15:50.000
AND EVEN WITH -- EVEN WITH THE

15:50.066 --> 15:51.800
HELP OF NONPROFITS IN LOCATING

15:51.867 --> 15:53.367
AND REUNITING PARENTS --

15:53.433 --> 15:54.400
HUNDREDS OF WHOM, INCIDENTALLY,

15:54.467 --> 15:56.033
WERE ACTUALLY DEPORTED WITHOUT

15:56.100 --> 15:57.433
THEIR CHILDREN -- THE GOVERNMENT

15:57.500 --> 15:58.700
STILL HAD FUCK-UPS, LIKE WHEN

15:58.767 --> 15:59.500
ONE MOTHER WHO'D HAD HER

15:59.567 --> 16:00.200
FIVE-MONTH-OLD BREASTFEEDING

16:00.266 --> 16:01.000
BABY TAKEN AWAY WAS LATER HANDED

16:01.066 --> 16:02.300
BACK THE WRONG BABY.

16:02.367 --> 16:03.000
AND JUST IMAGINE THINKING YOU'RE

16:03.066 --> 16:04.000
ABOUT TO BE REUNITED WITH YOUR

16:04.066 --> 16:05.600
CHILD AFTER BEING FORCED APART

16:05.667 --> 16:06.800
AND BEING GIVEN SOMEONE ELSE'S

16:06.867 --> 16:09.600
SHITTY BABY.

16:09.667 --> 16:10.600
I SAY THIS AS A PARENT:

16:10.667 --> 16:11.633
MY INFANT IS A MIRACLE AND A

16:11.700 --> 16:12.934
JOY.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.633
ANYONE ELSE'S IS A CHARMLESS

16:14.700 --> 16:15.667
SNOT-MONSTER.

16:15.734 --> 16:19.100
GET IT AWAY FROM ME.

16:19.166 --> 16:20.533
SO TO PUT IT MILDLY, WHEN IT

16:20.600 --> 16:22.367
COMES TO "HOW DID WE DO THIS?"

16:22.433 --> 16:24.166
THE ANSWER SEEMS TO BE A

16:24.233 --> 16:25.367
COMBINATION OF "INCOMPETENTLY"

16:25.433 --> 16:26.233
AND "CRUELLY."

16:26.266 --> 16:28.000
WHICH BRINGS US TO THE OTHER BIG

16:28.066 --> 16:29.400
QUESTION: WHY?

16:29.467 --> 16:30.967
WHY DID WE DO THIS?

16:31.033 --> 16:31.667
WELL, SOME IN THE TRUMP

16:31.734 --> 16:32.700
ADMINISTRATION ARGUED THEY

16:32.767 --> 16:34.033
SIMPLY HAD NO CHOICE.

16:34.100 --> 16:36.266
>> ARE YOU INTENDING FOR THIS TO

16:36.333 --> 16:36.967
PLAY OUT AS IT IS PLAYING OUT?

16:37.033 --> 16:38.500
ARE YOU INTENDING FOR PARENTS TO

16:38.567 --> 16:39.266
BE SEPARATED FROM THEIR

16:39.333 --> 16:40.300
CHILDREN?

16:40.367 --> 16:41.200
ARE YOU INTENDING TO SEND A

16:41.266 --> 16:42.333
MESSAGE?

16:42.400 --> 16:44.166
>> I -- I FIND THAT OFFENSIVE.

16:44.233 --> 16:45.500
NO.

16:45.567 --> 16:46.734
BECAUSE WHY WOULD I EVER CREATE

16:46.800 --> 16:48.266
A POLICY THAT PURPOSELY DOES

16:48.333 --> 16:49.567
THAT?

16:49.633 --> 16:50.834
>> PERHAPS AS A DETERRENT.

16:50.900 --> 16:52.400
>> NO.

16:52.467 --> 16:53.266
>> John: "NO!

16:53.333 --> 16:54.100
A DETERRENT?

16:54.166 --> 16:55.166
I WOULD NEVER!

16:55.233 --> 16:56.900
YOU OFFEND ME, SIR."

16:56.967 --> 16:57.734
HERE'S THE THING ABOUT THIS

16:57.800 --> 16:59.066
ADMINISTRATION: YOU CAN ALWAYS

16:59.133 --> 17:00.500
TELL YOU'VE FIGURED OUT EXACTLY

17:00.567 --> 17:02.100
WHAT THEY'RE DOING WHEN THEY GET

17:02.166 --> 17:03.166
OFFENDED BY YOUR DESCRIPTION OF

17:03.233 --> 17:03.967
WHAT THEY MIGHT BE DOING.

17:04.033 --> 17:05.233
IT'S A PRETTY OBVIOUS TELL.

17:05.300 --> 17:06.133
IT'S LIKE A POKER PLAYER

17:06.200 --> 17:07.066
EJACULATING EVERY TIME THEY HAVE

17:07.133 --> 17:08.433
A GOOD HAND.

17:08.500 --> 17:09.567
"OKAY, I THINK WE ALL SEE WHAT'S

17:09.633 --> 17:13.567
HAPPENING HERE."

17:13.633 --> 17:15.100
OFTEN, THE OFFICIAL LINE WAS

17:15.166 --> 17:16.133
THAT FAMILY SEPARATIONS WERE NOT

17:16.200 --> 17:17.367
A DETERRENT, THEY WERE SIMPLY A

17:17.433 --> 17:19.467
CONSEQUENCE OF HAVING TO ENFORCE

17:19.533 --> 17:21.300
THE LAW, AS THE THEN-ACTING

17:21.367 --> 17:22.934
HEAD OF I.C.E., THOMAS HOMAN,

17:23.000 --> 17:24.533
EXPLAINED AT THE TIME.

17:24.600 --> 17:26.066
>> EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY

17:26.133 --> 17:27.633
IN THIS COUNTRY SEPARATES

17:27.700 --> 17:28.700
PARENTS FROM CHILDREN WHEN

17:28.767 --> 17:30.500
THEY'RE ARRESTED FOR A CRIME.

17:30.567 --> 17:31.133
WE ARE A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.033
WE ARE ENFORCING THE CRIMINAL

17:32.100 --> 17:32.967
LAWS.

17:33.033 --> 17:33.867
I DON'T BLAME ANYBODY FOR

17:33.934 --> 17:34.967
WANTING TO BE IN THE GREATEST

17:35.033 --> 17:36.166
COUNTRY ON EARTH, BEING A PART

17:36.233 --> 17:37.000
OF THIS GREATEST COUNTRY ON

17:37.066 --> 17:38.000
EARTH, WHICH WE ALL ARE.

17:38.066 --> 17:38.800
BUT THERE'S A RIGHT WAY TO DO IT

17:38.867 --> 17:40.033
AND THERE'S A WRONG WAY TO DO

17:40.100 --> 17:41.200
IT.

17:41.266 --> 17:42.133
>> John: IT'S PRETTY HARD TO

17:42.200 --> 17:42.967
LISTEN TO SOMEONE SAY WE'RE THE

17:43.033 --> 17:44.233
GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH WHILE

17:44.300 --> 17:45.767
SIMULTANEOUSLY JUSTIFYING WHY

17:45.867 --> 17:47.500
WE'RE UNNECESSARILY RIPPING KIDS

17:47.567 --> 17:48.500
AWAY FROM THEIR PARENTS,

17:48.567 --> 17:49.667
ESPECIALLY WHEN THAT PERSON

17:49.734 --> 17:50.967
LOOKS LIKE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF

17:51.033 --> 17:52.133
A CAN OF MONSTER ENERGY DRINK

17:52.200 --> 17:54.000
FUCKED JOHN LITHGOW.

17:54.066 --> 17:55.500
BUT, LOOK, A FEW THINGS THERE

17:55.567 --> 17:58.233
REGARDING THE "RIGHT WAY,"

17:58.300 --> 17:59.700
BECAUSE FIRST, MANY OF THESE

17:59.767 --> 18:01.967
PEOPLE WERE APPLYING FOR ASYLUM,

18:02.033 --> 18:03.934
MEANING THEY'RE SEEKING

18:04.000 --> 18:05.767
PROTECTION FROM PERSECUTION,

18:05.834 --> 18:07.166
AND UNDER INTERNATIONAL AND

18:07.233 --> 18:08.533
U.S. LAW, IT IS LEGAL TO APPLY

18:08.600 --> 18:09.867
FOR THAT NO MATTER HOW YOU ENTER

18:09.934 --> 18:11.700
THE COUNTRY.

18:11.767 --> 18:13.100
SECOND, WHILE THE TRUMP

18:13.166 --> 18:15.400
ADMINISTRATION INSISTED THAT THE

18:15.467 --> 18:16.000
"RIGHT WAY" FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS

18:16.066 --> 18:17.800
TO COME IN WAS THROUGH A PORT OF

18:17.867 --> 18:18.467
ENTRY, LIKE AN OFFICIAL BORDER

18:18.533 --> 18:20.133
CROSSING, THEY MADE IT FAR MORE

18:20.200 --> 18:20.967
DIFFICULT TO DO THAT, WITH MANY

18:21.033 --> 18:22.100
BEING REPEATEDLY DENIED ENTRY

18:22.166 --> 18:23.967
INTO THE COUNTRY AND FORCED TO

18:24.033 --> 18:25.233
WAIT DAYS OR EVEN WEEKS.

18:25.300 --> 18:26.967
AND YOU CAN'T JUST ARBITRARILY

18:27.033 --> 18:28.867
DELAY PEOPLE THAT LONG.

18:28.934 --> 18:31.033
THEY'RE ASYLUM SEEKER LOOKING

18:31.100 --> 18:33.333
FOR SAFETY, NOT AT&T CUSTOMERS

18:33.400 --> 18:34.900
TRYING TO SPEAK TO A

18:34.967 --> 18:38.633
REPRESENTATIVE.

18:38.700 --> 18:39.333
THAT'S RIGHT!

18:39.400 --> 18:40.066
I GOT YOU, BUSINESS DADDY!

18:40.133 --> 18:41.000
I GOT YOU SO GOOD!

18:41.066 --> 18:42.066
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT

18:42.133 --> 18:50.867
IT?

18:50.934 --> 18:51.734
I'M RIGHT HERE.

18:51.800 --> 18:52.600
AND FINALLY, CROSSING THE BORDER

18:52.667 --> 18:53.533
IN THE "WRONG WAY" IS ACTUALLY

18:53.600 --> 18:54.700
ONLY A MISDEMEANOR ON

18:54.767 --> 18:55.200
FIRST OFFENSE.

18:55.266 --> 18:56.266
IN FACT, MOST PEOPLE ARE USUALLY

18:56.333 --> 18:57.467
JUST SENTENCED TO TIME SERVED.

18:57.533 --> 18:58.300
AND THAT'S THE THING HERE.

18:58.367 --> 18:59.300
CONTRARY TO WHAT YOU MIGHT

18:59.367 --> 19:00.333
THINK, MOST OF THE PARENTS WHO

19:00.400 --> 19:01.233
WERE SEPARATED FROM THEIR KIDS

19:01.300 --> 19:02.200
WERE CHARGED, PLED GUILTY, AND

19:02.266 --> 19:03.767
SERVED THEIR SENTENCE, ALL

19:03.834 --> 19:08.467
FAIRLY QUICKLY.

19:08.533 --> 19:11.700
NOW, IN THE PAST, WE GENERALLY

19:11.767 --> 19:12.433
DIDN'T PROSECUTE PARENTS AND

19:12.500 --> 19:14.400
THAT MANY OF THEM GO FREE

19:14.467 --> 19:16.300
AWAITING THEIR IMMIGRATION

19:16.367 --> 19:19.133
HEARING, WHICH MAKES SENSE.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.266
SO WHY DID WE SUDDENLY START

19:20.333 --> 19:21.400
KEEPING PEOPLE WHO HAD ALREADY

19:21.467 --> 19:22.200
SERVED THEIR TIME LOCKED UP AND

19:22.266 --> 19:22.967
AWAY FROM THEIR KIDS?

19:23.033 --> 19:24.300
WELL, BECAUSE TRUMP HATED THE

19:24.367 --> 19:24.667
OLD SYSTEM.

19:24.734 --> 19:25.867
HE CALLED IT "CATCH AND RELEASE"

19:25.967 --> 19:26.500
AND HE DESCRIBED IT IN WILDLY

19:26.567 --> 19:28.967
MISLEADING TERMS.

19:29.033 --> 19:30.100
>> WE CATCH A CRIMINAL, A REAL

19:30.166 --> 19:31.266
CRIMINAL, A ROUGH, TOUGH

19:31.333 --> 19:32.233
CRIMINAL, WE TAKE HIS NAME, AND

19:32.300 --> 19:35.200
THEN WE RELEASE HIM.

19:35.266 --> 19:36.100
AND WE SAY, "PLEASE SHOW UP

19:36.166 --> 19:37.934
TO COURT IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS."

19:38.000 --> 19:39.100
YOU KNOW WHAT THE CHANCES OF

19:39.166 --> 19:40.967
GETTING HIM TO COURT ARE?

19:41.033 --> 19:42.300
LIKE ZERO, OKAY?

19:42.367 --> 19:43.900
>> John: NOW, DEEP DOWN, WHEN

19:43.967 --> 19:46.533
TRUMP SAID THE NUMBER "ZERO",

19:46.600 --> 19:48.033
YOU JUST INSTINCTIVELY KNEW THAT

19:48.100 --> 19:49.767
NO MATTER WHAT THE NUMBER WAS,

19:49.834 --> 19:51.400
IT WAS NOT ZERO, BECAUSE IF HE

19:51.467 --> 19:52.033
SAYS SOMETHING'S HOT, IT'S COLD.

19:52.100 --> 19:52.667
IF HE SAYS SOMETHING'S UP, IT'S

19:52.734 --> 19:53.166
DOWN.

19:53.233 --> 19:53.967
IF HE SAID, "THIS IS A CUTE

19:54.033 --> 19:55.133
PUPPY," YOU'D AUTOMATICALLY

19:55.200 --> 19:56.100
THINK, "I'M NOT SURE WHY OR HOW,

19:56.166 --> 19:57.266
BUT THAT PUPPY IS DEFINITELY A

19:57.333 --> 20:01.433
FUCKING ASSHOLE."

20:01.500 --> 20:03.967
AND WHEN IT COMES TO FAMILIES

20:04.033 --> 20:04.900
SEEKING ASYLUM -- WHO, REMEMBER,

20:04.967 --> 20:06.533
WERE THE ONES LARGELY IMPACTED

20:06.600 --> 20:07.734
BY FAMILY SEPARATION --

20:07.800 --> 20:09.133
THE NUMBER IS RIDICULOUSLY FAR

20:09.200 --> 20:11.166
FROM ZERO, BECAUSE 96% OF THEM

20:11.233 --> 20:12.934
TURNED UP TO COURT AFTER BEING

20:13.000 --> 20:15.400
RELEASED FROM DETENTION.

20:15.467 --> 20:16.700
AND UNDER AN OBAMA

20:16.767 --> 20:17.900
ADMINISTRATION PROGRAM CALLED

20:17.967 --> 20:19.200
"FAMILY CASE MANAGEMENT," WHERE

20:19.266 --> 20:20.633
EACH FAMILY WAS ASSIGNED A

20:20.700 --> 20:22.500
CASE MANAGER WHO THEN HELPED

20:22.567 --> 20:24.533
THEM NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM, 99.3%

20:24.600 --> 20:25.967
ATTENDED THEIR HEARING.

20:26.033 --> 20:27.700
SO TRUMP WAS WRONG.

20:27.767 --> 20:29.166
HE WAS 99.3% WRONG.

20:29.233 --> 20:31.533
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

20:31.600 --> 20:32.367
WE GOT HIM!

20:33.467 --> 20:36.700
WE GOT HIM!

20:36.767 --> 20:38.200
NOW, YOU'RE PROBABLY EXPECTING

20:38.266 --> 20:39.734
THE TIGER TO COME OUT NOW, BUT

20:39.800 --> 20:40.934
SADLY, HE DIED OF SADNESS

20:41.000 --> 20:45.567
SEVERAL MONTHS AGO.

20:45.633 --> 20:47.000
SO ALL THIS BUTTON NOW DOES IS

20:47.066 --> 20:51.767
INCREASE MY MORPHINE DRIP, SO...

20:51.834 --> 20:52.967
IT JUST, UH...

20:53.033 --> 20:54.400
IT NUMBS THE PAIN.

20:54.467 --> 20:56.000
IT'S NOT PERFECT, BUT IT HELPS.

20:56.066 --> 20:56.600
SEE YOU LATER.

20:56.667 --> 20:57.867
NOW, TRUMP DISCONTINUED THAT

20:57.934 --> 20:58.533
CASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, DESPITE

20:58.600 --> 20:59.667
THE FACT THAT EVEN I.C.E. CALLED

20:59.734 --> 21:00.800
IT AN OVERALL SUCCESS, AND WENT

21:00.867 --> 21:02.667
WITH RIPPING APART FAMILIES

21:02.734 --> 21:04.000
INSTEAD.

21:04.066 --> 21:05.633
SO FOR THE FINAL TIME, WHY?

21:05.700 --> 21:09.867
IF THEY'D ALREADY PAID THE PRICE

21:09.934 --> 21:10.700
FOR THEIR CRIME AND THERE WERE

21:10.767 --> 21:11.767
OTHER, BETTER WAYS TO ENSURE

21:11.834 --> 21:12.967
THAT THEY SHOWED UP FOR COURT,

21:13.033 --> 21:14.033
WHY THE EVERLASTING FUCK DID WE

21:14.100 --> 21:15.934
REALLY DO THIS?

21:16.000 --> 21:17.533
WELL, I WOULD ARGUE THAT THIS IS

21:17.600 --> 21:19.100
THE LOGICAL RESULT OF A GENERAL

21:19.166 --> 21:20.200
HARD-RIGHT TURN TOWARD

21:20.266 --> 21:21.333
DEMONIZING IMMIGRANTS FOR

21:21.400 --> 21:22.400
POLITICAL ADVANTAGE IN A WAY

21:22.467 --> 21:23.600
THAT SOME MIGHT CALL "RACIST"

21:23.667 --> 21:25.800
AND OTHERS WOULD BE WRONG ABOUT.

21:25.867 --> 21:27.166
NOW, CONSERVATIVE IMMIGRATION

21:27.233 --> 21:28.433
ARGUMENTS ESSENTIALLY NOW FOLLOW

21:28.500 --> 21:30.400
A PRETTY CLEAR PATTERN:

21:30.467 --> 21:31.667
CROSSING THE BORDER IS A CRIME,

21:31.734 --> 21:33.233
THEREFORE ANYONE CROSSING IT IS

21:33.300 --> 21:35.000
A CRIMINAL.

21:35.066 --> 21:36.333
AND SINCE ALL CRIMINALS ARE

21:36.400 --> 21:37.600
DANGEROUS, ANYONE CROSSING THE

21:37.667 --> 21:39.567
BORDER IS A DANGEROUS CRIMINAL.

21:39.633 --> 21:41.133
NEVER MIND THE FACT THAT

21:41.200 --> 21:42.200
IMMIGRANTS ARE LESS LIKELY TO

21:42.266 --> 21:43.033
COMMIT CRIMES THAN PEOPLE BORN

21:43.100 --> 21:44.367
HERE.

21:44.433 --> 21:45.967
THAT HAS SIMPLY NOT STOPPED

21:46.033 --> 21:47.567
REPUBLICANS FROM RUNNING TOXIC,

21:47.633 --> 21:49.066
ANTI-IMMIGRANT, ANTI-CARAVAN

21:49.133 --> 21:51.066
POLITICAL ADS LIKE THESE:

21:51.133 --> 21:52.500
>> A YOUNG WOMAN, GUNNED DOWN BY

21:52.600 --> 21:54.166
AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT WHO

21:54.233 --> 21:55.567
SHOULD'VE BEEN DEPORTED.

21:55.633 --> 21:56.300
>> ILLEGAL ALIENS INVADE

21:56.367 --> 21:57.600
AMERICA.

21:57.667 --> 21:58.667
>> DEMOCRATS WHO STAND IN OUR

21:58.734 --> 21:59.967
WAY WILL BE COMPLICIT IN EVERY

22:00.033 --> 22:01.000
MURDER COMMITTED BY ILLEGAL

22:01.066 --> 22:02.533
IMMIGRANTS.

22:02.600 --> 22:04.200
>> MEXICAN DRUG LORDS.

22:04.266 --> 22:05.700
MS-13 GANG MEMBERS.

22:05.767 --> 22:06.600
SEX TRAFFICKERS.

22:06.667 --> 22:07.767
>> MS-13.

22:07.834 --> 22:09.033
VIOLENT GANG MEMBERS.

22:09.100 --> 22:09.834
>> GANG MEMBERS.

22:09.900 --> 22:11.033
KNOWN CRIMINALS.

22:11.100 --> 22:12.367
PEOPLE FROM THE MIDDLE EAST.

22:12.433 --> 22:14.200
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

22:14.266 --> 22:16.667
YOU KNOW THAT'S RACIST, 'CAUSE

22:16.734 --> 22:18.000
THEY JUST GAVE UP ANY PRETENSE

22:18.066 --> 22:19.333
OF SPECIFIC FEAR-MONGERING AND

22:19.400 --> 22:20.333
SIMPLY SAID "PEOPLE FROM THE

22:20.400 --> 22:21.934
MIDDLE EAST."

22:22.000 --> 22:25.867
AT THAT POINT, WHY NOT GO ALL-IN

22:25.934 --> 22:26.533
AND JUST START NAMING GROUPS YOU

22:26.600 --> 22:27.467
HATE?

22:27.533 --> 22:28.433
"THE CARAVAN ALSO CONTAINS

22:28.500 --> 22:29.600
PLANNED PARENTHOOD, GAYS WHO

22:29.667 --> 22:31.834
WANT WEDDING CAKES, BLACK SANTA,

22:31.900 --> 22:33.433
AND A 30-FOOT NANCY PELOSI.

22:33.500 --> 22:35.200
DEMOCRATS WILL BE COMPLICIT IN

22:35.266 --> 22:36.266
EVERY PERSON THE GIANT PELOSI

22:36.333 --> 22:40.300
EATS.

NUM-NUM-NUM-NUM!

22:41.333 --> 22:45.367
NUM-NUM-NUM-NUM-NUM!

22:45.433 --> 22:47.333
AND IF YOU WATCH ENOUGH OF THOSE

22:47.400 --> 22:48.233
ADS, YOU REALIZE IT'S NOT THAT

22:48.300 --> 22:49.266
THEY DON'T WANT IMMIGRANTS TO

22:49.333 --> 22:51.133
COME HERE BECAUSE THEY'RE

22:51.166 --> 22:51.500
CRIMINALS.

22:51.600 --> 22:53.233
IT'S THAT THEY'RE CALLING THEM

22:53.300 --> 22:53.800
CRIMINALS BECAUSE THEY DON'T

22:53.867 --> 22:54.300
WANT THEM TO COME HERE.

22:54.367 --> 22:56.734
AND TO SEE THAT IN ACTION, JUST

22:56.800 --> 22:57.967
WATCH THIS EXCHANGE THAT CNN HAD

22:58.033 --> 22:58.467
WITH A NEW JERSEY TRUMP

22:58.533 --> 22:58.934
SUPPORTER.

22:59.000 --> 22:59.867
>> SO YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT

22:59.934 --> 23:00.934
IMMIGRATION?

23:01.000 --> 23:02.100
>> ONLY COMING IN THE ILLEGAL

23:02.166 --> 23:02.967
WAY.

23:03.033 --> 23:04.600
NOT THE LEGAL WAY.

23:04.667 --> 23:06.934
COME IN THE LEGAL WAY AND YOU

23:07.000 --> 23:08.600
ARE MORE THAN WELCOME.

23:08.667 --> 23:09.400
>> I MEAN, IT IS LEGAL TO SEEK

23:09.467 --> 23:15.000
ASYLUM.

23:15.066 --> 23:16.233
>> WELL, I HOPE TRUMP CHANGES

23:16.300 --> 23:16.767
THAT.

23:16.834 --> 23:18.233
>> YOU DON'T WANT ANY

23:18.300 --> 23:19.433
ASYLUM SEEKERS?

23:19.500 --> 23:20.300
>> NO.

23:20.367 --> 23:21.900
>> John: IT'S SIMPLY NOT OFTEN

23:21.967 --> 23:22.533
YOU SEE SOMEONE'S COVER STORY

23:22.600 --> 23:23.500
FALL APART WITH SO LITTLE

23:23.567 --> 23:24.433
PUSHING.

23:24.500 --> 23:25.633
"ARE YOU THREE KIDS WEARING A

23:25.700 --> 23:26.500
TRENCH COAT?"

23:26.567 --> 23:27.533
"NO."

23:27.600 --> 23:28.467
"DO YOU WANT SOME ICE CREAM?"

23:28.533 --> 23:29.500
"YES, THERE ARE THREE OF US AND

23:29.567 --> 23:32.667
WE ALL LIKE CHOCOLATE."

23:32.734 --> 23:34.500
WE ARE -- WE'RE NOW SO

23:34.567 --> 23:35.633
ACCUSTOMED TO SEEING IMMIGRANTS

23:35.700 --> 23:37.500
AS A THREAT THAT POLITICIANS NOW

23:37.567 --> 23:38.367
ROUTINELY TALK ABOUT THEM IN THE

23:38.433 --> 23:41.767
LANGUAGE OF WAR.

23:41.834 --> 23:43.033
REMEMBER, TRUMP REFERRED TO THE

23:43.100 --> 23:43.900
CARAVAN AS AN INVASION AND SENT

23:43.967 --> 23:45.266
TROOPS TO THE BORDER.

23:45.333 --> 23:46.500
AND THAT KIND OF MILITARISTIC

23:46.567 --> 23:47.734
TALK CAN MAKE PEOPLE THINK THAT

23:47.800 --> 23:48.667
IT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE THE KIND

23:48.734 --> 23:50.133
OF IMPOSSIBLE CHOICES MADE

23:50.200 --> 23:52.100
DURING A WAR, WHICH IS HOW

23:52.166 --> 23:53.300
THINGS LIKE FAMILY SEPARATION

23:53.367 --> 23:55.300
HAPPEN.

23:55.367 --> 23:56.900
JUST WATCH AS JESSICA VAUGHAN,

23:56.967 --> 23:57.967
OF AN ANTI-IMMIGRATION THINK

23:58.033 --> 23:58.934
TANK, TRIES TO JUSTIFY WHAT WE

23:59.000 --> 24:00.200
DID.

24:00.266 --> 24:01.400
>> A LOT OF AMERICANS FIND IT

24:01.467 --> 24:02.667
APPALLING.

24:02.734 --> 24:04.633
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THEM?

24:04.700 --> 24:06.166
>> I THINK IT'S APPALLING THAT

24:06.233 --> 24:08.000
WE HAVE TO DO IT.

24:08.066 --> 24:09.333
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK THE

24:09.400 --> 24:12.033
CONSEQUENCES ARE FOR THESE

24:12.100 --> 24:13.400
CHILDREN THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH,

24:13.467 --> 24:14.266
THAT ARE STILL GOING THROUGH,

24:14.333 --> 24:16.433
THIS TRAUMA?

24:16.500 --> 24:17.500
>> I -- I THINK IT'S VERY

24:17.567 --> 24:18.700
POSSIBLE THAT SOME OF THESE KIDS

24:18.767 --> 24:19.800
WILL -- WILL HAVE SOME LASTING

24:19.867 --> 24:22.200
EFFECTS.

24:22.266 --> 24:23.767
>> John: RIGHT.

24:23.834 --> 24:25.200
BUT LASTING DAMAGE TO CHILDREN

24:25.266 --> 24:26.967
IS A HUGE CONSEQUENCE.

24:27.033 --> 24:28.467
YOU'RE SEPARATING THEM FROM

24:28.533 --> 24:29.367
THEIR PARENTS, NOT TELLING THEM

24:29.433 --> 24:31.233
YOU ATE ALL THEIR HALLOWEEN

24:31.300 --> 24:31.767
CANDY TO GET ON

24:31.834 --> 24:35.066
"JIMMY" FUCKING "KIMMEL."

24:35.133 --> 24:36.800
AND WHILE WE'RE ON THAT TOPIC,

24:36.867 --> 24:40.734
NO ONE SHOULD DO THAT.

24:40.800 --> 24:44.100
I MEAN, I'M REALLY GLAD SOME

24:44.166 --> 24:47.300
PEOPLE DO, BECAUSE IT'S

24:47.367 --> 24:48.000
EXTREMELY FUNNY.

24:48.066 --> 24:51.467
BUT NONE OF YOU SHOULD.

24:51.533 --> 24:52.567
AND WHILE SHE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT

24:52.633 --> 24:53.166
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS APPALLING,

24:53.233 --> 24:53.800
SHE SAYS "WE HAVE TO DO IT."

24:53.867 --> 24:55.033
BUT THE TRUTH IS, WE DON'T.

24:55.100 --> 24:55.633
WE DON'T HAVE TO DO ANY OF IT.

24:55.700 --> 24:56.900
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THE LANGUAGE

24:56.967 --> 24:59.333
OF WAR IS BEING USED, THERE

24:59.400 --> 25:00.934
IS NOT A WAR, AND THE ONLY

25:01.000 --> 25:02.200
REASON PEOPLE KEEP TALKING LIKE

25:02.266 --> 25:02.867
THERE IS IS TO GIVE THEMSELVES

25:02.934 --> 25:03.633
PERMISSION TO MAKE THE CHOICES

25:03.700 --> 25:05.567
THEY WANT TO BE FORCED TO MAKE.

25:05.633 --> 25:07.200
BUT FAMILY SEPARATION CAN NOT BE

25:07.266 --> 25:10.266
ONE OF THEM, BECAUSE AS SHE

25:10.333 --> 25:11.066
SAYS, "THESE KIDS WILL

25:11.133 --> 25:11.934
HAVE SOME LASTING EFFECTS."

25:12.000 --> 25:13.367
BUT WHILE THAT'S EASY TO SAY IN

25:13.433 --> 25:14.333
THE CONTEXT OF ABSTRACT

25:14.400 --> 25:16.367
PEDIATRIC SCIENCE, THE REALITY

25:16.433 --> 25:17.767
OF IT IS FUCKING HEARTBREAKING.

25:17.834 --> 25:18.900
TAKE JENRI.

25:18.967 --> 25:19.967
HE'S A SIX-YEAR-OLD FROM

25:20.066 --> 25:21.000
HONDURAS.

25:21.066 --> 25:22.133
HE WAS SEPARATED FROM HIS MOTHER

25:22.200 --> 25:23.533
AND REUNITED AFTER A MONTH

25:23.600 --> 25:24.834
APART, BUT AS A DOCUMENTARY CREW

25:24.900 --> 25:25.467
FOUND, THEIR ORDEAL WAS FAR FROM

25:25.533 --> 25:26.700
OVER.

25:26.767 --> 25:27.934
AND I'M WARNING YOU, THIS IS

25:28.000 --> 25:28.667
GOING TO BE ROUGH TO WATCH.

25:30.066 --> 25:30.834
>> I THINK I NEED TO LEAVE,

25:30.900 --> 25:32.233
OKAY?

26:24.000 --> 26:25.033
>> John: YEAH.

26:25.100 --> 26:27.467
WE DID THAT.

26:27.533 --> 26:28.967
AND NOT BECAUSE WE HAD TO, BUT

26:29.033 --> 26:30.500
BECAUSE WE CHOSE TO.

26:30.567 --> 26:32.467
AND HORRIFICALLY, WE MAY

26:32.533 --> 26:33.600
ACTUALLY BE ABOUT TO DO IT

26:33.667 --> 26:34.900
AGAIN.

26:34.967 --> 26:36.867
TRUMP HAS PUBLICLY FLIRTED WITH

26:36.934 --> 26:38.433
BRINGING BACK FAMILY SEPARATION,

26:38.500 --> 26:39.834
AND THOMAS HOMAN SUPPORTED THAT

26:39.900 --> 26:44.066
IDEA DURING A RECENT INTERVIEW

26:44.133 --> 26:45.667
WITH "FOX & FRIENDS," OR, AS

26:45.734 --> 26:46.467
IT'S KNOWN IN THE BUSINESS,

26:46.533 --> 26:47.300
"A FACE-TO-FACE MEETING WITH THE

26:47.367 --> 26:48.033
PRESIDENT."

26:48.133 --> 26:48.967
>> BUT LET ME TALK ABOUT

26:49.033 --> 26:49.834
ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY.

26:49.900 --> 26:50.700
THAT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO,

26:50.767 --> 26:51.600
REGARDLESS OF HOW SAD AND

26:51.667 --> 26:52.467
UNFORTUNATE IT IS.

26:52.533 --> 26:53.300
NO ONE WANTS TO SEE FAMILIES

26:53.367 --> 26:54.333
SEPARATED, BUT WHEN THEY

26:54.400 --> 26:55.266
SEPARATED THOSE PEOPLE THAT WERE

26:55.333 --> 26:56.200
PROSECUTED INTO THE COUNTRY

26:56.266 --> 26:57.166
ILLEGALLY, THE NUMBERS WENT DOWN

26:57.233 --> 26:58.567
22% IN JUST TWO WEEKS.

26:58.633 --> 26:59.567
IF THEY WOULD HAVE STUCK WITH

26:59.633 --> 27:00.900
THAT FOR 30, 60 DAYS, THERE

27:00.967 --> 27:03.600
WOULDN'T BE A CARAVAN TODAY.

27:03.667 --> 27:04.633
>> John: YEAH, MAYBE, TOM.

27:04.700 --> 27:05.967
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:06.033 --> 27:07.166
IF WE SURROUNDED THE BORDER WITH

27:07.233 --> 27:08.500
RANDOMLY FIRING FLAMETHROWERS

27:08.567 --> 27:09.800
AND SNAKES THAT WE'D TRAINED TO

27:09.867 --> 27:10.967
STAND UP WHENEVER ANYONE

27:11.033 --> 27:12.233
APPROACHED, THAT COULD

27:12.300 --> 27:13.367
POTENTIALLY DRIVE THE CARAVAN

27:13.467 --> 27:15.033
AWAY TOO, BUT WE DON'T DO THINGS

27:15.100 --> 27:16.400
LIKE THAT 'CAUSE IT'S NOT

27:16.467 --> 27:17.333
SUPPOSED TO BE WHO WE FUCKING

27:17.400 --> 27:23.333
ARE.

27:23.400 --> 27:25.633
AND I SAY THAT -- I SAY THAT --

27:25.700 --> 27:26.900
I SAY THAT FULLY AND PAINFULLY

27:26.967 --> 27:27.433
AWARE THAT IF TRUMP HEARS

27:27.500 --> 27:28.200
THAT IDEA COMING OUT OF A

27:28.266 --> 27:28.867
TELEVISION, HE MAY WELL GO,

27:28.934 --> 27:29.900
"SOMEONE WRITE THAT DOWN.

27:29.967 --> 27:30.667
SNAKES AND FLAMETHROWERS, THAT'S

27:30.734 --> 27:31.834
A GREAT IDEA.

27:31.900 --> 27:32.533
I HAD IT.

27:32.600 --> 27:34.633
THAT'S MY IDEA."

27:34.700 --> 27:35.633
SO LOOK, IF THE PRESIDENT REALLY

27:35.700 --> 27:38.333
WANTS TO MAKE TUESDAY'S ELECTION

27:38.400 --> 27:38.967
ABOUT HIM AND ABOUT IMMIGRATION,

27:39.033 --> 27:40.266
THEN FINE.

27:40.333 --> 27:41.767
LET'S MAKE IT ABOUT THAT,

27:41.834 --> 27:43.467
BECAUSE FAMILY SEPARATION IS

27:43.533 --> 27:44.734
PERHAPS THE MOST EMBLEMATIC

27:44.800 --> 27:46.567
MOMENT OF HIS PRESIDENCY SO FAR.

27:46.633 --> 27:48.734
IT WAS CRUEL, SLOPPY, NEEDLESS,

27:48.767 --> 27:51.200
RACIST, AND ULTIMATELY, EXACTLY

27:51.266 --> 27:52.967
WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED.

27:53.033 --> 27:54.767
AND I WOULD ARGUE THE BIGGEST

27:54.834 --> 27:56.533
THREAT TO OUR STATUS AS

27:56.600 --> 27:59.200
"THE GREATEST NATION ON EARTH"

27:59.266 --> 28:00.700
IS NOT A CARAVAN A THOUSAND

28:00.767 --> 28:04.400
MILES SOUTH OF US --

28:04.467 --> 28:09.233
IT'S WHOEVER THINKS THAT DOING

28:09.300 --> 28:10.066
THIS IS AN ACCEPTABLE FUCKING

28:10.133 --> 28:10.667
RESPONSE.

28:10.734 --> 28:11.500
AND NOW THIS.

28:11.567 --> 28:12.266
>> Announcer: AND NOW,

28:12.333 --> 28:13.166
HALLOWEEN PART 2: JUST THE

28:13.233 --> 28:14.266
TRAFFIC AND WEATHER.

28:14.333 --> 28:15.734
>> YEEZY IN THE HOUSE.

28:15.800 --> 28:18.400
>> YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, MAKING

28:18.467 --> 28:19.767
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

28:19.834 --> 28:21.033
>> MORE GOOD STUFF TO COME.

28:21.100 --> 28:21.700
GET YOUR FORECAST.

28:21.767 --> 28:22.433
>> IF YOU ARE ON THE EAST,

28:22.500 --> 28:23.567
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY FOR MORE

28:23.633 --> 28:24.867
SHOWERS.

28:24.934 --> 28:25.667
>> THESE RAIN SHOWERS ARE

28:25.734 --> 28:34.367
ASSOCIATED WITH A COLD FRONT,

28:34.433 --> 28:35.133
DON'T GET IN UNTIL LATE

28:35.200 --> 28:35.934
TOMORROW, EARLY FRIDAY.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.300
>> WE DO HAVE SOME PRECIPITATION

28:37.367 --> 28:37.900
DOWN SOUTH STARTING TO MOVE IN

28:37.967 --> 28:38.667
PARALLEL TO THE MOUNTAINS.

28:38.734 --> 28:39.300
YOU CAN SEE IT IN THE FOOTHILLS.

28:39.367 --> 28:40.300
>> YOU CAN SEE PRECIPITATION

28:40.367 --> 28:40.834
POPPING UP ACROSS EASTERN

28:40.900 --> 28:41.333
OREGON.

28:41.400 --> 28:42.133
>> A LITTLE POCKET NOW OF RAIN

28:42.200 --> 28:42.900
AND SNOW.

28:42.967 --> 28:43.767
>> HANGING IN FOR THE STORM

28:43.834 --> 28:44.700
CYCLE IN NOVEMBER.

28:44.767 --> 28:45.433
>> LET'S GO TO TRAFFIC WITH

28:45.500 --> 28:46.400
DEBBIE.

28:46.467 --> 28:47.233
>> IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE GOING TO

28:47.300 --> 28:48.767
START OFF IN THE HIGH 40s TO

28:48.834 --> 28:49.567
THE LOW 50s AGAIN.

28:49.633 --> 28:51.033
>> THE RAIN CHANCE KEEPS

28:51.100 --> 28:51.633
ELEVATING THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

28:51.700 --> 28:52.834
>> TEMPERATURES TONIGHT DIPPING

28:52.900 --> 28:54.100
INTO THE 40s.

28:54.166 --> 28:56.633
>> WE HAVE A WRECK AT

28:56.700 --> 28:57.500
INDEPENDENCE BOULEVARD,

28:57.567 --> 28:58.400
AND THAT IS A LOOK AT TRAFFIC.

28:58.467 --> 28:59.834
>>

28:59.900 --> 29:01.033
DIDN'T THINK THAT THROUGH ALL

29:01.100 --> 29:02.767
THE WAY.

29:02.834 --> 29:04.100
>> John: THAT'S OUR SHOW.

29:04.166 --> 29:04.900
THANKS SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

29:04.967 --> 29:05.467
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

29:05.533 --> 29:06.533
GOOD NIGHT.

29:08.433 --> 29:10.867
THANK YOU, NBC PEACOCK.

29:10.934 --> 29:13.600
THANK YOU, VERY NICE.

29:14.400 --> 29:15.734
I KNOW, I KNOW.

29:15.800 --> 29:18.266
IT SOUNDS TERRIBLE.

29:18.333 --> 29:22.967
I CAN'T IMAGINE.

29:23.033 --> 29:24.667
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW DIFFICULT IT

29:24.734 --> 29:26.233
WAS FOR YOU, OKAY?

29:26.300 --> 29:30.133
ALL RIGHT.

29:30.200 --> 29:30.834
THERE WE GO.

29:30.900 --> 29:31.734
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

29:31.800 --> 29:32.633
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

29:32.700 --> 29:33.934
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.800
IT'S MAINLY OVER.
