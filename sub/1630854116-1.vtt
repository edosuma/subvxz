00:34.468 --> 00:36.270
Come, come. Up, up, up.

00:46.179 --> 00:50.652
Wild. Bring up the caboose.
No dawdling.

00:52.252 --> 00:54.488
Wasn't Jesus Jewish?

00:54.856 --> 00:56.290
Why yes, he was.

00:57.725 --> 01:00.060
So, if we're Catholics,
and we try and be like Jesus,

01:00.160 --> 01:01.563
then why
aren't we Jewish?

01:02.530 --> 01:05.265
Well, that is
no concern of yours.

01:06.133 --> 01:08.268
Now, go along, then.

01:08.736 --> 01:11.138
Catch up to the other girls.

01:19.581 --> 01:21.481

03:57.705 --> 04:00.575
Agnes, you gotta come
out and look at these tomatoes.

04:01.075 --> 04:02.309
They're huge!

04:02.409 --> 04:03.878
<i>...be it J.C. or Allah,</i>

04:03.978 --> 04:05.747
<i>be it Yahweh</i>

<i>of ethical principles,</i>
<i>means that pretty much anything</i>

04:10.651 --> 04:12.687
<i>else you worship</i>
<i>will eat you alive.</i>

04:12.787 --> 04:14.555
Please come
out to the garden, now.

04:14.655 --> 04:17.024
All right, all right,
I was just trying to unwind.

04:17.592 --> 04:20.027
Your idea of unwinding
is most people's idea of winding

04:20.128 --> 04:23.698
themselves up into a frenzy
of fear and self-loathing.

04:36.911 --> 04:38.311
Oh, my God.

04:38.946 --> 04:42.683
Yes. A thousand times yes.

04:44.819 --> 04:46.353
We gladly accept.

04:47.755 --> 04:48.956
Who's we?

04:49.056 --> 04:50.423
That's a perfect
segue, actually.

04:50.525 --> 04:51.993
Um, I wanted to talk
to you about something.

04:52.093 --> 04:55.663
Turns out, looks like, by
the way, I'm pregnant. Surprise.

04:55.763 --> 04:58.132
Yeah, I'm pregnant.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.636
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:03.403 --> 05:05.873
Agnes! Welcome to the family,
Agnes! Wonderful.

05:07.374 --> 05:08.910
Ah, to life!

05:09.010 --> 05:11.378
To life! <i>L'chaim!</i>

05:11.478 --> 05:14.347
<i>L'chaim, l'chaim,</i> to life!

05:21.556 --> 05:22.924
You're all here.

05:23.024 --> 05:24.759
Oh, Glaucia
and Abe didn't make it

05:24.859 --> 05:27.895
because Glaucia
has a new serum launch.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.163
That's tonight.

05:34.302 --> 05:36.304
All right,
you get the moment.

05:36.403 --> 05:37.672
Do you want
to put some pants on?

05:37.772 --> 05:41.209
Yes. Yes, I'd like
to go put on some pants.

05:41.776 --> 05:43.711
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

05:43.811 --> 05:45.246
You know what,
Ruthie?

05:45.345 --> 05:47.915
-What?
-We're going to be grandparents!

05:56.456 --> 05:57.992
Who hired the photographer?

05:58.092 --> 05:59.327
My mom.

05:59.694 --> 06:01.062
You could have warned me.

06:01.162 --> 06:02.429
I asked her not to do it.

06:02.830 --> 06:05.633
I was about to shower,
but you rushed my process.

06:05.733 --> 06:06.801
I'm sorry.

06:06.901 --> 06:09.036
Oh, Levi, it's so beautiful.
Thank you.

06:09.904 --> 06:11.072
We're doing it.

06:12.439 --> 06:15.343
Wait, having the baby,
or getting married?

06:15.442 --> 06:16.878
Both.

06:19.513 --> 06:21.782
I'm glad you're glad,
because up until right now

06:21.883 --> 06:23.851
I was completely
freaked out about it.

06:24.218 --> 06:27.989
If you don't feel like
you're ready to have a baby,

06:28.789 --> 06:29.857
I get that.

06:29.957 --> 06:33.895
No, no, I mean,
strangely, I want to.

06:33.995 --> 06:35.462
Have it.

06:35.563 --> 06:38.032
You have
to be completely honest.

06:38.132 --> 06:39.600
I am being honest.

06:39.700 --> 06:40.668
Do you?

06:40.768 --> 06:44.639
I do. I want this baby.
I feel--

06:45.740 --> 06:47.942
I don't even know if there's
a word for how I feel.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.078
What were you
going to tell me about?

06:51.178 --> 06:52.747
This class or something?

06:52.847 --> 06:59.620
Oh, um... I enrolled us in
Journey Through Judaism class.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.355
Meets every week,
you can get the whole

07:01.454 --> 07:02.690
process started,
especially if we want

07:02.790 --> 07:03.991
to have a wedding
before the baby comes.

07:04.091 --> 07:07.962
Wait, wait, wait.
What-- what process?

07:08.329 --> 07:09.764
Your conversion.

07:10.164 --> 07:11.365
I'm converting?

07:11.999 --> 07:15.703
Yeah. I'm-- I'm pretty
sure we talked about this.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.638
No. So--

07:17.738 --> 07:19.573
Okay,
you know how I went

07:19.674 --> 07:20.875
to Catholic school, right?

07:20.975 --> 07:22.677
And I had all
the Catholic sacraments,

07:22.777 --> 07:25.112
except marriage, and so,
if there is a God, she probably

07:25.212 --> 07:28.015
already sees me as being
part of the Catholic persuasion,

07:28.115 --> 07:31.185
and beyond that
I'm a devout atheist, so...

07:31.285 --> 07:34.322
Which is why we're taking
the class with the wonderful,

07:34.422 --> 07:37.325
intelligent,
sensitive, feminist,

07:37.425 --> 07:40.628
the incomparable, Rabbi Cohen.

07:41.529 --> 07:44.799
I know it's going to be
a little awkward,

07:45.866 --> 07:50.905
but I love my family and this
is really important to them.

07:52.173 --> 07:54.408
Your parents love me.
Parents generally love me.

07:54.508 --> 07:55.676
Yeah, I know, of course they do.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.845
And it's the 21st century.

07:57.945 --> 08:00.081
I mean, we don't
live in the shtetl anymore.

08:01.816 --> 08:03.884
I have a cousin, Jake,
who is totally estranged

08:03.985 --> 08:06.787
from the family all because
his wife didn't convert.

08:07.388 --> 08:09.991
Totally estranged or,
just, they're a little upset?

08:10.091 --> 08:11.292
Totally estranged.

08:12.026 --> 08:15.495
Once you convert,
you will be my Jewish wife.

08:16.130 --> 08:18.498
Our children will
automatically be Jews.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.668
We don't have to be
conservative or keep kosher

08:20.768 --> 08:22.336
and all that stuff,
it's just that my mom

08:22.436 --> 08:23.904
and my dad
want to know that

08:24.005 --> 08:25.940
their grandchildren are part
of the tribe, officially.

08:26.040 --> 08:28.642
And, in Judaism,
one's Jewish identity

08:28.743 --> 08:32.613
is seen as passed
through the mother.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.515
That's a lot. Yeah.

08:34.615 --> 08:39.120
The conversion can be symbolic.
They love you.

08:39.987 --> 08:43.090
I love you.
More than anything.

08:44.358 --> 08:46.027
I'm asking you to do it for me.

08:50.131 --> 08:54.935
To marry the man of my dreams?
Seems like a small sacrifice.

09:25.766 --> 09:29.036
Eat. My. Ass.

09:37.178 --> 09:39.947
Eat. My. Ass.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.257
If I put it in
my batter, it would make

09:50.357 --> 09:51.892
my batter bitter,
but a bit of better butter,

09:51.992 --> 09:53.427
that would
make my batter better,

09:53.528 --> 09:54.995
so Betty Botter
bought a bit of better--

09:55.096 --> 09:58.065
-What are you doing?
-Warming up my instrument.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.667
Okay, let's go.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.602
- Are you ready?
- Let's-- Yeah, let's do this.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.137
All right. Great.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.706
And...

10:06.974 --> 10:08.209
Action.

10:09.243 --> 10:13.180
Gimme my money, dawg.
I need my money.

10:13.814 --> 10:16.083
Eat. My. Ass.

10:16.183 --> 10:18.085
Cut. Cut, cut, cut.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.187
Are you actually
going to do it like that?

10:20.287 --> 10:21.523
Well, how would you do it?

10:22.256 --> 10:25.159
Well, I mean, I might
do it kind of like, uh...

10:27.562 --> 10:29.263
Eat my ass.

10:30.798 --> 10:32.867
Okay, thanks
Daniel Day, but I think

10:32.967 --> 10:34.802
I'm going
to stick to my version.

10:34.902 --> 10:36.904
Can we do it one more time?
Like, a few more times? Please?

10:37.004 --> 10:38.472
-Please?
-We're going to be late

10:38.573 --> 10:39.907
for our first meeting
with the Rabbi.

10:42.076 --> 10:43.310
All right.

10:43.878 --> 10:45.479
-One more time. You ready?
-Okay.

10:45.580 --> 10:46.747
Yeah.

10:46.847 --> 10:49.183
And... action.

10:51.418 --> 10:53.487
Eat. My. Ass.

10:57.559 --> 10:59.860
Back to one. We gotta do
it again, that was your fault.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.162
It was kind of brilliant.

11:01.262 --> 11:03.397
- You can't cut me out?
- No.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.886
<i>Oy gevalt,</i>
Rabbi Cohen, we are ever

11:25.986 --> 11:28.623
so sorry for being
so appallingly late.

11:28.722 --> 11:30.191
That's okay, come on in.

11:30.291 --> 11:32.993
You can hang your coats
over there if you're warm.

11:35.062 --> 11:38.232
Oh, I'm-- I'm a bit
chilly, actually,

11:38.332 --> 11:40.167
so, I'm-- I'm going
to keep mine on for now.

11:40.267 --> 11:41.802
So, Rabbi.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.138
What do you think
about the Maccabees?

11:45.439 --> 11:46.941
The Maccabees?

11:47.041 --> 11:49.376
I was just reading this article
online that posited

11:49.476 --> 11:51.946
that the Maccabees,
when you really get down to it,

11:52.046 --> 11:55.449
are not unlike
the Jewish Taliban.

11:56.717 --> 11:58.185
Oh, wow.

11:58.786 --> 11:59.987
Well, uh,

12:00.087 --> 12:01.855
that statement
could be construed

12:01.956 --> 12:04.091
as wildly
antisemitic.

12:04.191 --> 12:07.761
I just wanted to get your
scholarly, rabbinical opinion.

12:08.195 --> 12:09.930
I think
the question here is, uh,

12:10.030 --> 12:13.234
why we'd be making that
comparison in the first place?

12:15.704 --> 12:16.904
Right.

12:17.004 --> 12:19.773
Um, I'd love
to be the one to smash

12:19.873 --> 12:21.643
the glass
at the wedding, if possible.

12:21.742 --> 12:24.278
If not, that's
also completely fine.

12:25.079 --> 12:29.483
It has traditionally
been "the man" who smashes

12:29.584 --> 12:30.985
the glass at the wedding.

12:31.085 --> 12:32.786
However, my partner
and I both smashed a glass

12:32.886 --> 12:34.723
at our wedding, so,
it's a Choose Your Own Adventure

12:34.822 --> 12:36.890
kind of thing
as far as I'm concerned.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.260
That's what I said.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.598
Oh.

12:43.698 --> 12:45.466
Your hair's falling out.

12:46.735 --> 12:48.202
Oh, wow, um...

12:48.302 --> 12:50.904
did you know that female
pattern baldness affects one

12:51.005 --> 12:53.207
in five women
under the age of 35?

12:53.307 --> 12:55.809
-Oh.
-It's-- it's tragic, really.

12:55.909 --> 12:57.444
I'm so sorry about that.

12:58.312 --> 12:59.547
Um...

13:02.116 --> 13:04.485
Is there anything,
uh, we can do to prepare

13:04.586 --> 13:06.020
for our first class next week?

13:06.120 --> 13:09.390
Oh, wow, our 45 minutes
are up, unfortunately.

13:09.490 --> 13:11.225
Levi can fill you
in on the rest, I think.

13:11.325 --> 13:14.629
Uh, I'm late for a bris,
so, I've got to scoot.

13:14.729 --> 13:16.163
Enjoy the bris.

13:16.698 --> 13:18.232
Thank you, I always do.

13:19.133 --> 13:20.502
- Bye.
- See you next week.

13:20.602 --> 13:22.036
Bye.

13:36.984 --> 13:38.553
Let's go sit
in the park and share a cruffin.

13:38.653 --> 13:40.921
On the house. I can
turn tricks for baked goods.

13:41.021 --> 13:44.024
I'm just going to have something
at my desk later, okay?

13:45.059 --> 13:46.460
I messed up, didn't I?

13:46.561 --> 13:49.698
No. It's all good.
We'll have another meeting.

13:49.798 --> 13:51.131
I've got
to get back to the office,

13:51.231 --> 13:52.866
I'm drowning in depositions.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.435
What are you going
to do for the rest of the day?

13:54.536 --> 13:57.204
Hmm, after school.
Before that, no idea.

13:57.572 --> 14:00.407
Why don't you go by Maude's, see
if she's got any new projects?

14:00.508 --> 14:02.209
Maybe you could
read for something, right?

14:03.911 --> 14:05.513
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

14:13.822 --> 14:15.356
They're
uneducated, self-loathing,

14:15.456 --> 14:17.991
antisemitic,
philandering Hollywood pricks,

14:18.092 --> 14:20.628
that don't know the first
thing about the theater.

14:20.729 --> 14:22.096
Oh, sh--

14:22.196 --> 14:23.798
Come bearing lunch.
No cursing, no cursing.

14:23.897 --> 14:25.633
I'm on a cleanse.
A verbal cleanse.

14:25.734 --> 14:28.068
It's been a rough day and
I'm looking for a little calm.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.304
Did you take
your meds today, sweetheart?

14:30.404 --> 14:32.707
I cursed in front
of a first-grader last week

14:32.807 --> 14:34.341
and I still
feel guilty about it.

14:34.441 --> 14:36.944
I've been Hail Mary-ing
non-stop and it's not helping.

14:38.713 --> 14:39.814
<i>You</i> pray?

14:40.481 --> 14:42.717
Well, I'm superstitious,
so, as you can imagine,

14:42.817 --> 14:44.952
religion is
very triggering for me.

14:45.052 --> 14:47.988
Now I'm about
to be a role model 24/7

14:48.088 --> 14:50.625
because, guess what,
I'm pregnant.

14:53.327 --> 14:54.629
Terrific.

14:54.729 --> 14:57.498
<i>Oy vey,</i> you got
yourself knocked up? Seriously?

14:58.098 --> 15:00.901
What-- what?
Of course they'll forget you.

15:01.435 --> 15:03.571
The successful ones,
they always do.

15:04.037 --> 15:07.709
Didn't I write all
the tech avails in an email?

15:07.809 --> 15:09.076
Well--

15:09.176 --> 15:10.277
What is the point of email

15:10.377 --> 15:11.679
if nobody
reads the whole thing?

15:11.780 --> 15:12.847
Louise!

15:12.946 --> 15:13.947
I'm going to have to ask--

15:14.047 --> 15:15.617
I'm-- I'm getting another ca--

15:15.717 --> 15:16.885
Louise!

15:16.984 --> 15:18.051
Oh, screw it.

15:18.152 --> 15:20.020
I mean-- Where is my intern

15:20.120 --> 15:21.989
and what is her name?

15:22.356 --> 15:24.258
That-- that-- that zounderkite.

15:24.358 --> 15:26.260
We had to let her go.

15:26.895 --> 15:29.597
Budget cuts.
We don't have interns anymore.

15:29.697 --> 15:31.198
What is a zounderkite?

15:31.298 --> 15:32.901
How is that
because of budget cuts

15:33.000 --> 15:35.235
when we never paid the interns?

15:35.637 --> 15:39.072
And if you're going to be
restricting my speech, my dear,

15:39.173 --> 15:40.809
I am going to have to get
creative, sweet cheeks.

15:40.909 --> 15:42.142
Zounderkite means idiot.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.011
And the intern's
name was Anya, or Avra,

15:44.111 --> 15:45.580
or Omelette
or some <i>fakakta</i> name.

15:45.680 --> 15:47.147
Well,
where is that freaking piece

15:47.247 --> 15:50.618
of paper with all
the tech avails on it?

15:50.718 --> 15:53.721
Oh, oh,

15:53.822 --> 15:56.791
Lane Bryant,
laced brazier, $12.99.

15:56.891 --> 15:59.694
Huh, you know,
this seafoam green color

15:59.794 --> 16:01.228
would look great on you.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.297
Oh, thank you
for the cheesesteak.

16:03.832 --> 16:05.332
Your Reuben's
on your desk, Shel.

16:05.432 --> 16:07.602
Would you like
to see the brazier

16:07.702 --> 16:09.871
I bought
on macys.com last week?

16:09.970 --> 16:11.840
Please don't flash me, Maude.

16:11.940 --> 16:13.307
Not today.

16:13.407 --> 16:15.877
Whoo!

16:17.612 --> 16:21.482
Oh, you--
you've lost your sense of fun.

16:21.583 --> 16:23.952
Where's the old Agnes?
I miss her.

16:24.051 --> 16:26.053
Maude, is there
anything I can read for?

16:26.153 --> 16:27.889
I'm desperate for a role.
One line in anything.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.490
Nothing. Nothing.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.358
You're not diverse.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.928
Directors want diverse,
and not pregnant.

16:34.027 --> 16:36.330
Yeah.
Oh, oh... casting.

16:36.430 --> 16:42.302
Willhelm, I freaking told you,
read the freaking email, okay?

16:42.402 --> 16:45.005
Yes, I love Morgan Freeman, too,

16:45.105 --> 16:46.841
okay, but even if it wasn't

16:46.941 --> 16:48.242
because
he was already booked

16:48.342 --> 16:50.043
for the next ten pictures,

16:50.143 --> 16:53.515
he would not do your rotten
turd of a movie.

16:54.281 --> 16:57.685
Why? Because
he's a movie star! That's why!

16:58.285 --> 16:59.521
Ugh.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.523
Here, have a bite.

17:01.623 --> 17:03.390
I-- I don't want a bite.

17:03.490 --> 17:04.959
You're pregnant, have a bite.

17:05.058 --> 17:06.493
All right.

17:14.502 --> 17:17.705
My bad. Um,
hey, I'm looking for drama.

17:18.673 --> 17:20.107
Right this way.

17:21.743 --> 17:23.511
Agnes!

17:24.077 --> 17:26.079
Hi. Hello.

17:28.282 --> 17:30.785
Sparrow, come, it's time to go.

17:30.885 --> 17:33.688
No, Dad.
Sandy just dropped me off.

17:33.788 --> 17:35.023
I know, I made a mistake.

17:35.122 --> 17:36.123
You've got your ukulele
lesson in--

17:36.223 --> 17:37.491
in ten minutes.

17:37.859 --> 17:39.192
I know I overbooked you.
Come on.

17:39.293 --> 17:41.563
Dad, get it together.

17:42.195 --> 17:44.398
Agnes, do you
want to meet my pet wig?

17:44.498 --> 17:48.068
I brought her in especially
for theater games today.

17:48.168 --> 17:49.871
Her name is Marianne.

17:49.971 --> 17:51.171
Hi, Marianne.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.472
Honey, look,
I'm sorry, all right?

17:52.574 --> 17:54.008
We'll reorganize
your schedule tonight

17:54.107 --> 17:55.677
and, uh, we'll be
back next week, yeah?

17:55.777 --> 17:57.912
It's surprising
how many extra-curricular

17:58.012 --> 17:59.814
activities
a seven-year-old has.

18:00.347 --> 18:03.718
I want to do the dating game.
I don't want to go to ukulele.

18:03.818 --> 18:06.386
Dating game!
Dating game! Dating game!

18:06.486 --> 18:07.922
Dating game, what's that,
a teaching method

18:08.022 --> 18:09.891
I'm not aware of?
Yelling at the teacher?

18:09.991 --> 18:11.291
Yell at the teacher!

18:11.391 --> 18:13.027
Yell at the teacher!
Yell at the teacher!

18:13.595 --> 18:15.128
Time is money, ladies.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.097
Indeed. Come on,
baby, we gotta go.

18:17.197 --> 18:18.633
Come on, come on, come on.

18:18.733 --> 18:20.602
Okay. Thank you.
It was nice to meet you.

18:20.702 --> 18:21.803
Nice to meet you.

18:21.903 --> 18:23.136
Be well, everyone.
Next week.

18:23.236 --> 18:24.839
- Bye, Sparrow.
- Bye, Sparrow.

18:24.939 --> 18:26.007
See you next week.

18:26.473 --> 18:29.242
Okay, how about
we play First Female President?

18:29.343 --> 18:30.511
I feel like
the dating game isn't

18:30.612 --> 18:33.380
really socially relevant
or P.C. anymore.

18:34.114 --> 18:38.251
Dating game! Dating
game! Dating game! Dating game!

18:38.352 --> 18:42.356
All right,
welcome to the dating game.

18:42.456 --> 18:45.158
We have some beautiful
candidates here this evening.

18:45.258 --> 18:48.529
First, I'd like to start off
with our bachelorette.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.032
Please introduce yourself,
bachelorette.

18:51.131 --> 18:54.736
Hello,
I am Ms. Mustachio.

18:54.836 --> 18:59.874
Ms. Mustachio is so excited
to meet her soulmate today.

18:59.974 --> 19:01.341
Uh, Ms. Mustachio,

19:01.441 --> 19:03.878
what is your favorite
flavor of ice cream?

19:04.612 --> 19:08.281
Probably birthday cake, cookies
and cream and strawberry.

19:08.382 --> 19:11.653
Three flavors, everyone.
Let's meet the candidates.

19:11.753 --> 19:14.088
We have this fine, young
gentleman. What is your name?

19:14.187 --> 19:15.623
Mr. Robot.

19:15.723 --> 19:18.026
Do you have
any hobbies, Mr. Robot?

19:19.694 --> 19:21.796
Uh, not swimming because
that would break me,

19:21.896 --> 19:25.465
and I don't have a hobby
and I just jump in butt.

19:25.933 --> 19:30.905
Okay. All right, it's getting
late. Kids are tired.

19:38.478 --> 19:41.816
I told David that
Levi's fiancé isn't Jewish yet,

19:41.916 --> 19:43.283
but she will be.

19:43.383 --> 19:46.788
Yeah, Agnes is determined
to be as Jewish

19:46.888 --> 19:48.623
as she possibly can be.

19:49.256 --> 19:51.125
Abe and Glaucia
just joined our synagogue.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.895
They got off the waiting
list yesterday.

19:54.862 --> 19:56.064
How's Agnes?

19:56.164 --> 19:58.331
Good. Uh,
she just had a big audition.

19:59.332 --> 20:00.702
Well, for what?

20:00.802 --> 20:01.969
Film, I think?

20:02.070 --> 20:03.504
Uh, what-- what's the role?

20:04.672 --> 20:07.508
President.
Of the United States.

20:07.608 --> 20:08.976
Oh, that's perfect.

20:09.077 --> 20:10.410
-I hope she gets it.
-Me, too.

20:10.511 --> 20:12.547
And she's
excited about converting?

20:12.647 --> 20:15.983
She's thrilled
to convert and happy about it.

20:17.417 --> 20:18.553
And she's feeling well?

20:18.653 --> 20:20.454
The pregnancy's going smoothly?

20:20.555 --> 20:24.592
Um, so far so good. I'm on
my way uptown to the office.

20:24.692 --> 20:26.561
Priya said you had
the Smithfield chemical file.

20:26.661 --> 20:29.030
Yes, yes.
Handle with care.

20:29.130 --> 20:30.198
Thanks.

20:30.565 --> 20:31.966
I'm getting old, Levi.

20:32.800 --> 20:34.869
It's good to know
that our clients

20:34.969 --> 20:36.470
are in such capable hands.

20:36.571 --> 20:40.541
Uh, both of my boys
becoming men, getting married,

20:40.641 --> 20:43.477
carrying on
the traditions of our people.

20:44.212 --> 20:45.947
So glad we didn't
have to go through

20:46.047 --> 20:48.248
the drama
of Uncle Josh's family.

20:48.348 --> 20:50.417
They were just--
uh, they were devastated

20:50.518 --> 20:53.521
when Jake didn't marry
within the faith and then, uh,

20:53.621 --> 20:55.690
whats-her-name
wouldn't even convert.

20:56.190 --> 20:58.126
-Maureen.
-What?

20:58.226 --> 20:59.894
Maureen.
That's Jake's wife.

20:59.994 --> 21:03.598
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
Uh, she's an Irish Catholic.

21:03.998 --> 21:05.499
Oy-oy-oy-oy.

21:05.600 --> 21:08.102
So, you and Agnes, uh,
will be making an appearance

21:08.202 --> 21:10.705
at the Feltshew shiva,
uh, on Sunday?

21:10.805 --> 21:12.472
Yeah, uh, who died?

21:12.573 --> 21:13.741
Shmoo?

21:13.841 --> 21:16.443
No, no, no, no.
Bubbie Feltshew. Great lady.

21:16.544 --> 21:18.946
Yeah, she was.
A lot of chutzpah.

21:19.881 --> 21:23.518
Daphna will be
there with the Levinsons.

21:24.384 --> 21:25.586
Why are you telling me that?

21:25.686 --> 21:28.355
Well, because,
uh, you were friends

21:28.455 --> 21:31.458
and, uh, lovers
for a very long time.

21:31.559 --> 21:33.060
I thought you
might like to know.

21:34.829 --> 21:35.830
Lovers?

21:35.930 --> 21:38.166
Dad, Daphna's my ex.

21:38.266 --> 21:39.667
I don't want to hear about her.

21:40.034 --> 21:42.737
Roger that. All right,
see you in court tomorrow.

21:42.837 --> 21:44.205
Okay, I'll see
you in court tomorrow.

21:44.304 --> 21:45.740
-Take care, take care.
-Bye, Dad.

21:50.278 --> 21:52.479
Ah...

21:53.247 --> 21:54.314
Oh

21:54.816 --> 21:57.819
Yes, yes,
Your Honor, how are you?

22:01.122 --> 22:04.025
I've been so
furiously busy with my new web

22:04.125 --> 22:06.194
series on yoga-lates,

22:06.294 --> 22:08.328
and the serum launch,
of course.

22:08.428 --> 22:10.430
And now with the two weddings,

22:10.531 --> 22:13.400
the one in Lisbon
and the one here in Brooklyn...

22:13.968 --> 22:15.368
It's exciting.

22:15.903 --> 22:17.370
So exciting.

22:18.172 --> 22:19.240
Um,

22:20.241 --> 22:23.211
can I ask you a question about
your business, Glaucia Eduarda?

22:23.311 --> 22:24.779
It's actually Glaucia.

22:24.879 --> 22:25.947
Eduarda.

22:26.047 --> 22:27.315
That's what I said.

22:27.414 --> 22:29.382
And my business
is a top 500 company,

22:29.482 --> 22:31.219
and requires
no quotation marks.

22:31.319 --> 22:32.553
Oh, I did-- I didn't...

22:32.920 --> 22:36.157
mean to put-- I didn't
put quotation marks around it.

22:36.257 --> 22:37.490
I just said--

22:37.592 --> 22:38.960
Mm. I guess
it was your tone, then.

22:39.827 --> 22:42.864
Agnes, uh,
by the way, don't mention

22:42.964 --> 22:45.700
Abe and Glaucia Eduarda
going to city hall.

22:46.499 --> 22:49.737
Why not?
I was going to tweet it.

22:49.837 --> 22:53.241
Shout it from the rooftops.
Abe and Eduarda got hitched!

22:53.341 --> 22:55.276
It's Glaucia Eduarda.

22:55.375 --> 22:57.678
They got engaged
right after we did. Whoo-hoo.

22:57.778 --> 23:01.115
Well, we completed
the administrative procedure.

23:01.215 --> 23:04.752
But we don't want this
to detract from the main event.

23:04.852 --> 23:07.855
We only went to city hall
to expedite the process.

23:09.523 --> 23:11.359
First of all,
I don't understand the whole

23:11.458 --> 23:14.427
detracting from
the main event thing.

23:14.829 --> 23:19.600
And, um, secondly, I thought
you were going to elope?

23:20.400 --> 23:23.403
We wanted to embrace
our Jewish identities,

23:23.504 --> 23:25.106
and celebrate with the family.

23:25.206 --> 23:26.240
In the faith.

23:26.340 --> 23:27.642
Hmm.

23:29.377 --> 23:32.546
Oh, did you guys hear
that Glaucia Eduarda

23:32.647 --> 23:34.882
was actually offered
a role on a pilot?

23:35.448 --> 23:36.951
I mean,
they basically just wanted her

23:37.051 --> 23:40.688
to play herself and--
and rep her brand on the show.

23:40.788 --> 23:42.590
My patients
are too important to me.

23:42.690 --> 23:44.358
Patients?

23:44.457 --> 23:46.661
I thought-- I thought
you were a yoga teacher?

23:46.761 --> 23:48.729
That's merely
one aspect of what I do.

23:49.130 --> 23:50.430
Do you follow me on Instagram?

23:50.531 --> 23:52.465
No, no, no, I don't, um,

23:52.566 --> 23:55.803
engage with...
the social media.

23:55.903 --> 23:57.138
And why is that?

23:57.238 --> 23:58.372
It makes people depressed.

23:58.471 --> 23:59.941
It's generally
not good for you.

24:00.041 --> 24:02.376
That opinion
is actually just a symptom

24:02.475 --> 24:04.512
of an overall
intellectual backlash.

24:04.612 --> 24:06.914
Well, it's not really
an opinion, its science, but--

24:07.014 --> 24:08.549
Mm, agree to disagree.

24:09.016 --> 24:10.785
The entertainment
industry is fun,

24:10.885 --> 24:15.488
but it's not serious
enough for me, at least.

24:16.456 --> 24:17.959
And the way they treat
women in Hollywood,

24:18.059 --> 24:20.094
it's savage, isn't it?

24:20.460 --> 24:23.397
You know what?
I think that women

24:23.496 --> 24:25.032
in Hollywood
have never been more empowered.

24:25.132 --> 24:26.499
Hmm.

24:26.600 --> 24:30.438
I think that.
Because... a lot of reasons.

24:30.538 --> 24:32.907
For example,
I auditioned to play

24:33.007 --> 24:37.211
a very strong,
powerful, confident

24:38.379 --> 24:40.548
strong, woman.

24:40.648 --> 24:42.416
A sex worker who...

24:43.117 --> 24:47.989
makes tough choices based on
difficult economic realities.

24:51.192 --> 24:52.360
How was your day, Levi?

24:52.460 --> 24:54.628
Oh, my day was pretty good.

24:54.729 --> 24:57.365
Uh, we had one witness
kind of get cold feet,

24:57.999 --> 25:00.634
so we're going to have
to rethink that strategy,

25:00.735 --> 25:02.169
but, otherwise...

25:13.280 --> 25:14.782
Oh, here you go.

25:14.882 --> 25:16.717
Oh, no, sadly
I-- I cannot imbibe.

25:16.817 --> 25:18.519
I am... with child.

25:18.619 --> 25:20.421
Of course.
Mazel, mazel.

25:20.554 --> 25:23.557
How brave of you two.

25:24.625 --> 25:26.460
Yeah, no,
it wasn't really brave,

25:26.560 --> 25:29.063
it was just more careless.

25:29.830 --> 25:31.065
Stupid.

25:31.165 --> 25:32.700
A little bit spontaneous,
is what I'm trying to say,

25:32.800 --> 25:35.469
and, uh, what I'm really
trying to say is that

25:35.569 --> 25:37.138
it wasn't planned, so...

25:37.671 --> 25:39.106
as you might have guessed.

25:39.206 --> 25:43.110
Um, okay, well,
in the spirit of giving up

25:43.210 --> 25:45.813
on my dreams, will you
please pass me one of those...

25:46.347 --> 25:47.615
-breads?
-Mm.

25:47.715 --> 25:51.185
These are
actually buckwheat naan toasts.

25:51.719 --> 25:53.154
Better for the baby.

25:53.654 --> 25:55.122
Oh, so it's, like, all seeds.

25:55.222 --> 25:56.390
Yeah.
It's healthy.

25:56.490 --> 25:58.459
Not-- not really bread.

25:58.859 --> 26:00.294
You'll get used to it.

26:02.463 --> 26:05.633
Mm. Delicious.

26:05.733 --> 26:07.601
Mm. You have two
of those in the morning,

26:07.701 --> 26:09.437
a little espresso.

26:09.538 --> 26:11.405
Keeps you, uh, regular.

26:11.506 --> 26:12.940
Mm-hmm.

26:17.111 --> 26:18.312
What's for dessert?

26:18.412 --> 26:19.980
Hibiscus ice cubes.

26:20.081 --> 26:21.315
Mm.

26:22.316 --> 26:23.552
Sheer arrogance.

26:23.651 --> 26:24.852
The hypocrisy.

26:24.952 --> 26:26.120
Who cares?

26:26.220 --> 26:27.855
We get to live our lives,
we get to be together.

26:27.955 --> 26:29.924
You and me
and Ernie and the baby.

26:30.024 --> 26:32.993
Fortune 500 company?

26:33.094 --> 26:34.028
Give me a break.

26:34.128 --> 26:35.396
We only have
to sit through one

26:35.496 --> 26:36.964
of those dinners
one time a month.

26:37.064 --> 26:38.899
You gotta learn
to put things in perspective.

26:39.366 --> 26:42.069
You're right.
You're so wise.

26:42.636 --> 26:44.071
Yes, I am.

26:56.817 --> 26:58.786
Oh.

27:00.855 --> 27:02.723
Oh, my God, I'm so
sorry. Let me help you up.

27:02.823 --> 27:04.758
Stay away from me,
you dirty <i>shiksa.</i>

27:04.859 --> 27:06.694
Whoa, lady, you're the one
covered in garbage, okay?

27:06.794 --> 27:08.162
Let me help you up.

27:08.262 --> 27:09.797
Whoa, Jesus Christ, lady.

27:09.897 --> 27:11.265
We're trying
to help you, all right?

27:11.365 --> 27:12.534
That's your problem.

27:12.633 --> 27:13.968
Jesus Christ.

27:14.068 --> 27:15.769
He's Jewish,
he's a member of the tribe.

27:15.870 --> 27:18.239
Don't waste your breath.
These people think I'm an animal

27:18.339 --> 27:19.740
because I'm not orthodox.

27:20.641 --> 27:22.109
-That doesn't make any sense.
-I know.

27:22.209 --> 27:23.578
It's an extremist cult,
it doesn't need

27:23.677 --> 27:25.012
to make any sense.
In fact,

27:25.112 --> 27:27.448
the more irrational, the better.
Let's go home.

27:27.549 --> 27:28.816
Okay.

27:46.834 --> 27:48.769
Any progress
with the masterpiece?

27:49.170 --> 27:52.273
Right now
it's just an empty canvas.

27:52.740 --> 27:54.576
I'm thinking
of keeping it that way.

27:54.942 --> 27:57.646
Ah, yes.
The minimalist approach.

27:58.012 --> 28:01.516
The highest form of cubist
abstraction. The penultimate.

28:01.616 --> 28:04.619
You know,
my dad says a lot of writers

28:04.718 --> 28:07.656
experience periods
of intense inactivity.

28:07.788 --> 28:09.890
But even if you're
not putting pen to paper,

28:09.990 --> 28:11.292
your mind is working.

28:11.392 --> 28:13.861
It may feel like you
don't exist, but you do.

28:14.328 --> 28:15.630
You're all perfectionists.

28:15.729 --> 28:18.432
That's your problem.
Me, I'm just...

28:20.301 --> 28:21.902
completely out of ideas.

28:22.002 --> 28:23.470
I'm completely boring.

28:23.871 --> 28:25.339
That's silly, Frankie.

28:25.439 --> 28:28.909
You're a fascinating,
multi-dimensional woman.

28:29.009 --> 28:32.012
Agreed. And you look
stunning today, by the way.

28:32.813 --> 28:34.815
I haven't washed
my hair in two weeks.

28:35.584 --> 28:38.553
Do you know what Margaret Atwood
says about perfectionism?

28:38.653 --> 28:41.155
That it slowly,
quietly kills you?

28:41.255 --> 28:42.289
Yes.

28:42.389 --> 28:43.625
If I waited for perfection

28:43.724 --> 28:45.125
I'd never write a word.

28:45.226 --> 28:50.699
So, procrastination
is really just a bad habit

28:50.798 --> 28:53.434
that stems
from a desire to not fail.

28:53.535 --> 28:54.935
Exactly.

28:55.035 --> 28:57.471
Why don't you just
Jackson Pollock that canvas?

28:57.572 --> 28:58.939
Show it who's boss.

28:59.039 --> 29:02.943
Your idea of what I do
is hilarious. So actor-y.

29:03.911 --> 29:07.147
Jackson Pollock is so old.

29:07.881 --> 29:09.883
He's deceased, actually.

29:10.652 --> 29:12.753
I think
it's an accurate reference.

29:12.853 --> 29:15.155
I mean,
the term "action painting"

29:15.256 --> 29:17.692
was basically
invented for him, so...

29:18.158 --> 29:20.861
At least you get to be,
I don't know, physical.

29:21.630 --> 29:24.733
You get to punch out
those letters on the keyboard.

29:24.832 --> 29:26.433
Plus, acting is very physical.

29:27.368 --> 29:29.470
If only someone
would allow me to do it.

29:29.571 --> 29:31.905
Allow you?
Come on, Agnes.

29:32.006 --> 29:33.874
Push that rock
up the hill yourself.

29:33.974 --> 29:36.877
Put your big girl
pants on and get on with it.

29:36.977 --> 29:38.979
Make your own opportunities.

29:39.880 --> 29:41.549
Maybe we should swap for a week.

29:41.650 --> 29:43.017
You give me
your act two,

29:43.117 --> 29:44.785
I'll lend you
the keys my studio?

29:44.885 --> 29:46.353
Hmm? Hmm?

29:46.453 --> 29:50.157
Oh, Frankie, Sparrow
and I made something for you.

29:50.257 --> 29:51.492
Oh!

29:54.295 --> 29:57.532
Ah, it's very on trend.
I love it.

30:00.501 --> 30:02.836
Oh, fudge.

30:02.936 --> 30:04.972
Frankie
almost said the "F" word.

30:05.072 --> 30:07.274
Then she didn't.
She said fudge.

30:07.374 --> 30:09.744
Can you teach
my Zumba class for me tonight?

30:09.843 --> 30:11.478
Sudima has an opening.

30:11.579 --> 30:15.115
It's an all-female production
of <i>All My Sons,</i> and I completely

30:15.215 --> 30:17.752
forgot about it,
but I promised her I'd go.

30:17.851 --> 30:19.453
She's been
working on it for years.

30:19.554 --> 30:20.622
Okay, but--

30:21.088 --> 30:23.090
Fabulous,
I'll text you the deets.

30:25.326 --> 30:26.561
Oh, my God. Uh...

30:28.362 --> 30:30.064
Frankie, take Leah
and Henry to the office.

30:30.164 --> 30:32.333
Call 911 and then Sparrow's dad.

30:33.400 --> 30:36.270
You're going to feel
a lot better soon, I promise.

30:39.907 --> 30:41.375
Hey, where is she?
How long was the seizure?

30:41.475 --> 30:43.010
-Did you time it?
-It was about ten minutes.

30:43.110 --> 30:44.345
She went with the E.M.T.s

30:44.445 --> 30:46.013
and the school
nurse to the hospital.

30:47.481 --> 30:48.916
Okay.

31:04.264 --> 31:06.133
And now shut up and eat.

31:06.500 --> 31:08.335
You should be
grateful I cook for you.

31:09.269 --> 31:14.074
When I was in the Le Mont,
we had the most gorgeous crêpes.

31:14.542 --> 31:19.113
Honey with powdered sugar
for breakfast every morning.

31:19.547 --> 31:24.586
And the sweetest,
freshest mangos you ever tasted.

31:24.952 --> 31:28.889
And where is my Beefeater
Gibson, straight up?

31:29.289 --> 31:33.093
You ungrateful
American snob. Huh.

31:33.193 --> 31:37.164
In Poland, you are lucky you
get moldy potato for breakfast.

31:37.264 --> 31:41.268
Oh, cry me a river,
you old windbag.

31:41.736 --> 31:43.137
Oh.

31:43.237 --> 31:46.608
<i>♪ Oh,</i>
<i>my darling granddaughter ♪</i>

31:46.708 --> 31:50.944
<i>♪ Oh, my darling Agnes, dear ♪</i>

31:51.044 --> 31:54.915
<i>♪ Don't get lost,</i>
<i>stay here forever ♪</i>

31:55.015 --> 31:58.018
<i>♪ Darling,</i>
<i>please don't disappear ♪</i>

31:58.118 --> 32:00.120
Your dinner's in the fridge.

32:00.220 --> 32:02.256
This time,
please share it with Fred.

32:02.356 --> 32:05.192
You hear that now?
Share it with Fred.

32:05.292 --> 32:07.629
I thought you were going deaf.

32:07.729 --> 32:09.597
Well, only selective hearing.

32:09.997 --> 32:11.633
Pa, look at my finger.

32:13.267 --> 32:15.637
Oh. Oh!

32:16.103 --> 32:18.640
Congratulations.

32:19.273 --> 32:22.476
Frederick, my little girl
is getting married

32:22.577 --> 32:23.845
to a lovely man.

32:23.944 --> 32:25.680
Ah, good luck.

32:26.681 --> 32:28.683
I've been married
four times, each one more

32:28.783 --> 32:30.217
disastrous
than the one before it.

32:30.317 --> 32:34.021
Don't listen to him.
It's exquisite.

32:34.121 --> 32:37.525
The ring. Wowee.

32:39.894 --> 32:42.463
Levi's a lucky man.

32:42.897 --> 32:46.868
And, by the way,
I'm also pregnant.

32:46.967 --> 32:50.170
- Ah.
- Oh, my goodness.

32:50.270 --> 32:52.874
Congratulations, my dear.

32:52.973 --> 32:54.776
That is wonderful news.

32:54.876 --> 32:58.947
Children are
an absolute blessing.

32:59.046 --> 33:00.515
They are? It is?

33:00.615 --> 33:02.817
Because I was kind
of freaked out initially, but--

33:02.917 --> 33:04.318
because it wasn't planned.

33:04.418 --> 33:08.188
Yeah. The best things
in life are not.

33:08.288 --> 33:10.825
Uh, how's the play going?

33:10.925 --> 33:12.727
I don't
want to talk about it.

33:12.827 --> 33:16.196
Oh. You must
persevere, my dear.

33:16.296 --> 33:20.434
No daughter of mine,
especially a grand one,

33:20.535 --> 33:21.769
gives up.

33:21.870 --> 33:24.338
You know, you do realize
I am your only living offspring,

33:24.438 --> 33:25.807
so, maybe it might have been

33:25.907 --> 33:27.441
a good idea
if mom had given up

33:27.542 --> 33:29.309
her singing career and all
the drugs that went with it.

33:29.409 --> 33:32.680
You and your mother
are not the same person.

33:32.780 --> 33:37.451
She was vulnerable to certain
pitfalls of the business,

33:37.552 --> 33:41.355
but you've
learned from her mistakes.

33:41.723 --> 33:43.123
You come the way you come.

33:43.223 --> 33:45.359
You're saying I'm crazy
so I should just lean in?

33:45.459 --> 33:47.461
I think you're an artist.

33:47.562 --> 33:51.231
And everybody's
a little bit crazy.

33:51.331 --> 33:55.469
Never trust anyone
who claims to be normal.

33:56.236 --> 33:58.940
Well, I love
you both, but I gotta run.

33:59.039 --> 34:00.708
Where are you off to now?

34:00.808 --> 34:02.042
Zumba class.

34:02.142 --> 34:04.779
Wh-- Wh-- Zu-Zu--
what-- what's a Zumba?

34:05.178 --> 34:07.114
Um, it's like dance.

34:07.214 --> 34:09.383
-I think.
-Oh.

34:09.884 --> 34:11.251
-Bye.
-Bye bye bye.

34:11.351 --> 34:12.352
- Bye-bye, my darling.
- See you soon.

34:12.452 --> 34:14.054
Love you.

34:16.056 --> 34:18.893
I-- I do the Zumba pretty well.

34:19.326 --> 34:20.695
I bet you do.

34:20.795 --> 34:23.330
Zumba.

34:32.040 --> 34:33.741
Hello, ladies.

34:35.108 --> 34:36.544
Sexy gay man.

34:38.412 --> 34:40.113
Uh, my name
is Agnes and I will be

34:40.213 --> 34:43.083
filling in
this evening for Frankie.

34:46.654 --> 34:48.890
This is what I like to call,

34:48.990 --> 34:52.292
um, radical acceptance Zumba.

34:52.392 --> 34:54.461
Which is to say,
it's not exactly kosher Zumba

34:54.562 --> 34:57.397
or Zumba as you
may have done it before.

34:58.231 --> 35:01.035
Rule number one:
there are no rules.

35:01.501 --> 35:05.073
There are no right steps,
there are no wrong steps.

35:05.172 --> 35:07.508
Simply steps.

35:09.109 --> 35:10.678
Uh, what about stretching?

35:11.579 --> 35:15.683
Stretching is not a part
of our fitness philosophy here

35:15.783 --> 35:20.187
at radical Zumba because
we simply do whatever we want.

35:22.289 --> 35:23.457
I want you to laugh.

35:23.558 --> 35:27.996
Cry, burp,
fart, scream, whatever

35:28.096 --> 35:30.497
feels right
to you in the moment.

35:30.865 --> 35:32.432
Don't hold back, okay?

35:32.533 --> 35:36.236
Because this is your time,
ladies, and sexy gay man.

35:36.336 --> 35:37.739
So, leave
your Lululemons at home

35:37.839 --> 35:39.306
because this
is an authentic,

35:39.406 --> 35:43.077
screw the patriarchy,
women's lib kind of workout.

35:43.176 --> 35:45.445
I would say burn your bras,
but don't do that,

35:45.546 --> 35:48.516
because the only
person that hurts is you.

35:50.384 --> 35:53.487
Bras are important. We need
all the support we can get.

35:55.355 --> 35:58.258
The world will try
and knock you down,

35:58.358 --> 36:04.297
but today we are building
ourselves back the fudge up.

36:04.398 --> 36:06.333
So, work it.
Show me what you got.

36:06.433 --> 36:10.538
Leave it all on this dancefloor,
right here, right now.

36:10.638 --> 36:12.707
Because life
is short and cruel,

36:12.807 --> 36:16.176
so let's have
some freaking fun for once.

36:17.979 --> 36:19.881
Are you
on the schedule next week?

36:38.666 --> 36:40.467
I was teaching a Zumba class.

36:41.736 --> 36:42.804
You do Zumba?

36:43.336 --> 36:44.471
I do now.

36:44.972 --> 36:49.443
Hello, everybody,
and thank you for being here.

36:49.544 --> 36:51.145
We are so
thrilled to have you

36:51.244 --> 36:54.882
at our Journey Through Judaism
fall semester.

36:54.982 --> 36:57.885
My name is Rabbi Jane Cohen,
I'm new at the synagogue,

36:57.985 --> 37:01.122
and you all are my first
Journey Through Judaism

37:01.254 --> 37:02.757
class ever!

37:02.857 --> 37:05.526
Come on. Oh, yeah.

37:06.961 --> 37:09.831
Wow, okay,
so, <i>b'ezrat HaShem,</i> which means

37:09.931 --> 37:13.668
"with God's help,"
let's get to the point.

37:16.003 --> 37:17.270
<i>Tachles,</i>

37:17.672 --> 37:20.440
for those of you who don't know,
means, uh, getting to the point.

37:20.541 --> 37:21.876
Getting to
the quintessence of something.

37:21.976 --> 37:23.443
It's something
Israelis say when they want

37:23.544 --> 37:25.445
to say "get to the point,"
essentially.

37:25.546 --> 37:27.247
Okay, I am repeating myself.

37:27.347 --> 37:29.650
Yeah, let's, uh, hm-mm--
we're-- we're-- we're going

37:29.751 --> 37:33.755
to start every class with
our weekly <i>simchas</i> and sorrows.

37:33.855 --> 37:35.890
A <i>simcha,</i> for
those of you who don't know,

37:35.990 --> 37:37.658
means "a little joy."

37:37.759 --> 37:39.359
Something small,
can be anything.

37:39.459 --> 37:40.995
Uh, does anybody have a <i>simcha</i>

37:41.095 --> 37:42.597
they'd like
to share for the week?

37:42.697 --> 37:44.431
Oh, and if you could, um,
introduce yourself and tell us

37:44.532 --> 37:47.434
why you're here, enrolled,
that would be great as well.

37:48.002 --> 37:50.238
I-- I-- I'm Virginia.

37:51.105 --> 37:57.145
And I found out on ancestry.com
that I'm half Jewish.

37:57.245 --> 37:59.647
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

37:59.747 --> 38:03.151
My <i>simcha</i> for the day is that,

38:03.251 --> 38:06.988
yesterday,
I became a grandmother.

38:08.689 --> 38:11.592
Lovely.
A baby is a blessing.

38:11.692 --> 38:14.494
The highest blessing.
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

38:16.798 --> 38:17.865
Any sorrows?

38:18.298 --> 38:22.837
I have sorrows.
My name is Zeynep.

38:22.937 --> 38:25.006
I am from Istanbul.

38:25.706 --> 38:29.510
And I am curious about
the Jewish and I--

38:29.610 --> 38:33.346
I want to convert to the Jewish
because of rich history.

38:33.981 --> 38:40.353
Uh, my sorrow is: my ferret,
Yasmin, died this morning.

38:40.888 --> 38:42.123
Tragically.

38:42.723 --> 38:47.795
Uh, she got stuck in the, uh,
how do you call it, the-- the--

38:48.930 --> 38:52.432
the escalator
machine at the grocery store.

38:53.201 --> 38:56.737
Uh, it was
a mess and, uh, she--

38:56.838 --> 38:59.740
lots of blood
and, uh, her body was taken

38:59.841 --> 39:02.877
away and, uh,
I will never see her again.

39:05.646 --> 39:07.715
I am so sorry, Zeynep.

39:10.017 --> 39:11.819
Speaking of...

39:14.121 --> 39:19.359
unfortunate female figures
that we will never forget, um,

39:19.459 --> 39:21.461
let's just
get to our first parsha.

39:21.929 --> 39:25.099
Um, the story
of Rachel and Leah.

39:25.199 --> 39:28.368
If you will
please turn to page 94.

39:29.369 --> 39:32.740
You will see
there that Leah,

39:32.840 --> 39:35.442
one of the matriarchs
of the Jewish people,

39:35.543 --> 39:39.479
is described as tender,
because she had been crying.

39:39.580 --> 39:40.882
Why is that, do you ask?

39:40.982 --> 39:45.385
Well, Leah had been
consigned to marry Esau,

39:45.485 --> 39:46.854
Jacob's older brother.

39:46.954 --> 39:49.690
Now, Esau was
the more aggressive,

39:49.790 --> 39:52.193
less desirable
of the two brothers.

39:52.293 --> 39:56.297
He was a fan
of hunting and brothels.

39:56.396 --> 39:59.300
Jacob, on the other hand--
iconic Jacob--

39:59.399 --> 40:02.203
he was a real mensch,
the <i>tzadik,</i>

40:02.303 --> 40:04.138
the righteous one,
if you will.

40:04.238 --> 40:06.674
In other words, God's
personal emissary, that's--

40:06.774 --> 40:12.813
Rabbi, didn't Jacob and Esau's
father, Laban,

40:13.381 --> 40:14.782
get involved?

40:15.249 --> 40:16.617
And I thought--

40:16.717 --> 40:19.053
Yes, yes, he did,
and I was just about to get--

40:19.153 --> 40:22.323
And what about those,
uh, slutty slave women who come

40:22.455 --> 40:25.526
later in the story,
like Zilpah and Bilhah?

40:26.227 --> 40:28.863
Yes, Zeynep, they do--
they were just about to come.

40:28.963 --> 40:31.132
I mean, I guess now
that we're on the subject,

40:31.232 --> 40:32.733
Bilhah and Zilpah are...

40:32.833 --> 40:34.602
I think she's hitting on you.

40:35.069 --> 40:36.871
That's because
I'm ridiculously good-looking.

40:36.971 --> 40:38.806
Can't a guy
take a theology seminar

40:38.906 --> 40:40.808
without getting
ogled and objectified?

40:40.908 --> 40:42.009
I guess not.

40:42.109 --> 40:44.345
Agnes, Levi,
everything good over there?

40:44.712 --> 40:47.048
Yes, I'm fine, we're fine.

40:47.515 --> 40:49.750
Thank you, Rabbi,
please continue. Hashem.

40:50.151 --> 40:51.585
Oh, Hashem.

40:52.787 --> 40:55.423
Okay,
uh, where was I? Yes.

40:56.157 --> 40:57.758
Do you know what Hashem means?

40:57.858 --> 41:01.062
Uh, I thought--
I don't know but I think

41:01.162 --> 41:02.396
it means peace be with you?

41:02.495 --> 41:04.832
No, it-- it means, uh--

41:04.932 --> 41:06.400
Okay, uh,
this-- this is something

41:06.499 --> 41:07.902
I usually say
for my first-graders.

41:08.002 --> 41:10.538
Am I going
to have to separate you two?

41:11.471 --> 41:13.040
-No. Sorry.
-Won't happen again.

41:14.241 --> 41:17.144
Great. Uh,

41:17.812 --> 41:22.049
Jacob, Esau,
Rachel, Leah, family drama.

41:22.149 --> 41:25.619
What could be more
Jewish than that? Page 95.

Good morning.

43:29.210 --> 43:30.311
Good morning.

43:30.411 --> 43:32.046
Last night was incredible.

43:33.214 --> 43:37.251
It was. Just thought
we should sleep for five more.

43:37.918 --> 43:40.988
What if I make iced cappuccinos?

43:41.722 --> 43:43.057
-Hmm?
-Come on.

43:43.157 --> 43:45.993
Get up.
We're going shopping.

43:46.561 --> 43:47.695
For what?

43:47.795 --> 43:49.263
A <i>kiddush</i> cup.

43:50.397 --> 43:51.999
A what cup?

43:52.099 --> 43:56.270
A <i>kiddush</i> cup. It's for wine,
but also for prayer.

43:56.370 --> 44:00.841
Kinda. Come on, let's go!
<i>Kiddush</i> cup!

44:01.742 --> 44:04.145
Whoa, this place is fantastic.

44:04.245 --> 44:05.913
Thanks for having us.

44:06.847 --> 44:08.215
Look at these.

44:08.315 --> 44:09.551
Beautiful.

44:14.021 --> 44:16.891
Are you one
of these hipster artists?

44:17.658 --> 44:20.027
Yes, sir.
I believe I am an artist.

44:20.127 --> 44:23.164
Ah.
What do artists do all day?

44:23.264 --> 44:26.635
Well, that's a good question.
Um, depends on the artist.

44:26.734 --> 44:28.969
For example,
my namesake, Agnes Martin,

44:29.069 --> 44:30.905
used to read
murder mysteries and work

44:31.005 --> 44:32.740
in her garden for most of the
day when she wasn't painting,

44:32.840 --> 44:34.742
-of course.
-Can we look at this one?

44:41.616 --> 44:43.751
-Right? Okay, we'll take it.
-Yeah.

44:50.659 --> 44:52.026
Enjoy.

44:52.126 --> 44:53.160
Oh, I will.

44:53.260 --> 44:54.461
Bring me home a donut?

44:55.262 --> 44:56.697
This is Williamsburg AA.

44:56.797 --> 44:59.099
It's lemon-ricotta
cronuts or bust.

45:04.405 --> 45:06.974
I just don't understand
why you insist on fasting.

45:07.408 --> 45:10.878
You eat 11 meals
a day and you're pregnant.

45:11.345 --> 45:12.746
I'm fine, okay?

45:12.846 --> 45:15.216
I just want to do
this Yom Kippur thing properly.

45:15.316 --> 45:16.951
Let me do me.

45:18.886 --> 45:22.456
What is Yom Kippur
really about?

45:24.425 --> 45:26.894
Okay, it's the day of atonement.

45:29.096 --> 45:30.798
We all know
that the Jewish faith

45:30.898 --> 45:36.370
has long been associated
with a deep sense of guilt.

45:36.737 --> 45:38.038
Shoutout
to the Jewish mothers--

45:38.138 --> 45:39.773
Are you familiar with that?

45:39.873 --> 45:42.142
So, now I have Catholic
guilt and Jewish guilt.

45:42.243 --> 45:43.944
We're trying
to in here.

45:44.044 --> 45:45.412
Sorry.

45:45.513 --> 45:47.781
... self-awareness,
which, though rather unpleasant,

45:47.881 --> 45:50.251
can lead us
to grow and self-improve.

45:50.351 --> 45:54.221
Shoutout to my Jewish
mother in the room. But...

45:55.256 --> 45:58.560
this shame thing
can also paralyze us.

45:58.660 --> 46:00.361
It can deafen us.

46:01.929 --> 46:03.964
Guilt blocks us.

46:05.165 --> 46:06.400
Hmm.

46:09.236 --> 46:12.906
Back in ancient times,
all the way back,

46:13.007 --> 46:16.343
back to Israel,
the high priests would

46:16.443 --> 46:21.815
lead us in ritual animal
sacrifice, believe it or not.

46:23.350 --> 46:26.387
Because in Judaism,
in order to atone,

46:26.487 --> 46:29.223
you had to give up something
that's valuable to you.

46:29.323 --> 46:30.558
That's why we fast.

46:32.426 --> 46:35.996
But this line of thinking
can be a slippery slope,

46:36.096 --> 46:40.501
so, we, the Israelites,
decided to draw the line

46:40.602 --> 46:43.337
at child sacrifice.

46:43.437 --> 46:45.105
Yeah, we called it Moloch.

46:45.573 --> 46:48.242
Believe it or not,
many of the neighboring tribes

46:48.342 --> 46:50.779
regularly sacrificed
their children to Moloch,

46:50.878 --> 46:54.749
but we, the Jews--
we drew up laws against it.

46:54.848 --> 46:57.351
Not us, not Israel.

46:59.420 --> 47:06.026
Israel, the word itself means
"one who wrestles with God."

47:07.428 --> 47:11.566
This has given us an identity
as the chosen people.

47:11.666 --> 47:15.302
Exceptional,
yes, but burdened

47:15.402 --> 47:18.807
to live honorably
every single day of our lives.

47:19.239 --> 47:23.844
My question is:
how can we possibly live

47:23.944 --> 47:28.115
in that light if we cannot
confront the darkness?

47:29.617 --> 47:30.884
You know what?

47:32.520 --> 47:33.987
I wasn't gonna...

47:36.023 --> 47:37.424
but I am gonna say it.

47:38.158 --> 47:40.394
We need to talk about Palestine.

47:41.730 --> 47:43.665
We're afraid
to talk about Palestine,

47:43.765 --> 47:46.066
and even worse,
we're afraid to listen.

47:48.936 --> 47:51.740
Why ruin a dinner party,
or a sermon,

47:51.840 --> 47:53.907
by broaching
this sensitive topic?

47:54.007 --> 47:59.046
Why offend my only living
grandparent? Why go there?

47:59.146 --> 48:04.451
Because if we strive,
as Jews, for <i>tikkun olam,</i>

48:04.552 --> 48:07.187
to heal the world,
we need to confront the issues

48:07.287 --> 48:10.257
that threaten
to destroy it and us.

48:10.924 --> 48:13.127
There are way
too many of us who pick a side.

48:14.495 --> 48:16.865
Who teach our children,
as I was taught,

48:16.964 --> 48:18.833
to pick a team
and stick with it.

48:18.932 --> 48:21.068
To defend
that team no matter what.

48:21.969 --> 48:24.204
We want to win,
and we want the other team

48:24.304 --> 48:26.140
to lose, so, what do we do?

48:26.541 --> 48:29.410
We bind ourselves
to an absolute confidence,

48:29.511 --> 48:32.012
the supreme sense
of righteousness.

48:32.112 --> 48:35.550
The chosen people,
superior, arrogant.

48:36.917 --> 48:42.089
We, as American Jews, need to
rid ourselves of this arrogance.

48:45.426 --> 48:47.294
Because we don't
know what it's like...

48:48.195 --> 48:52.299
to be, what,
a Palestinian orphan,

48:52.399 --> 48:55.102
terrified
to walk to school alone.

48:56.069 --> 49:00.441
An Israeli mother
sending her teenage daughter

49:00.542 --> 49:02.943
off to join
the endless wars of the I.D.F.

49:03.043 --> 49:05.880
A Palestinian
refugee in Lebanon, homeless,

49:05.979 --> 49:08.683
jobless, stateless,
separated from his family.

49:09.450 --> 49:12.554
We need to accept
that our understanding

49:12.654 --> 49:15.590
of this issue is limited,
and that's okay.

49:16.990 --> 49:19.627
And we can disagree,
and we can argue,

49:19.727 --> 49:22.664
and we can fight, but I'll tell
you what we're not going to do:

49:22.764 --> 49:26.400
we're not going to deny
anybody else's humanity, okay?

49:27.134 --> 49:28.603
'Cause we've been there.

49:30.572 --> 49:34.509
There're still people all around
the world, in every country,

49:34.609 --> 49:38.245
including this one,
who do not see us as human.

49:38.345 --> 49:40.247
Who hate us
for being who we are.

49:41.248 --> 49:44.853
Every single person in this
room has something that could be

49:44.953 --> 49:48.155
used against her,
whether it's her gender,

49:48.255 --> 49:52.493
her sexual orientation, her
skin color, a mental disorder,

49:52.594 --> 49:56.764
a physical disability,
everybody has something.

49:58.332 --> 50:01.201
So, I'm asking you, today,

50:03.036 --> 50:07.074
to open your hearts
and your minds.

50:08.943 --> 50:13.080
And to beg you not
to sacrifice yourselves,

50:13.781 --> 50:17.084
your friends,
your family, or your community

50:17.184 --> 50:20.053
upon the altar
of ideology and division.

50:20.755 --> 50:26.426
Because that destruction
is a prayer to Moloch.

50:47.916 --> 50:49.082
What's up?

50:49.182 --> 50:50.685
I'll be right back.

51:04.164 --> 51:05.533
Agnes!

51:11.238 --> 51:12.707
Make sure you eat enough.

51:13.240 --> 51:15.743
You know? No more fainting.

51:18.880 --> 51:20.548
-Mm.
-Mm.

51:22.482 --> 51:26.153
That's a fun ensemble, Agnes.

51:26.253 --> 51:28.221
Very, uh,
- chic.

51:28.322 --> 51:30.024
Thank you, Glaucia Eduarda.

51:30.157 --> 51:33.061
This is my,
um, Yom Kippur ensemble.

51:33.160 --> 51:34.896
You know,
we were very, uh,

51:34.996 --> 51:39.099
intrigued,
by your Rabbi's service.

51:39.801 --> 51:42.937
She's very... modern?

51:43.838 --> 51:46.373
It wasn't really
a typical Yom Kippur sermon.

51:46.874 --> 51:49.877
How's the struggle
with the acting career going?

51:50.243 --> 51:54.481
Great. Um, you may
now address me as Charlene.

51:54.582 --> 51:56.918
I got the part
of the crack whore.

51:57.018 --> 51:58.185
Ah!

51:58.285 --> 52:01.254
Wow. Congratulations.

52:01.756 --> 52:04.324
You know,
actually, uh, Glaucia Eduarda

52:04.424 --> 52:06.828
has almost
completed her conversion.

52:07.729 --> 52:09.764
I mean, she--
she's done, like, everything.

52:11.599 --> 52:12.600
<i>Mazel.</i>

52:12.700 --> 52:14.535
Erwy Felstein
from the Schneider's

52:14.636 --> 52:16.470
more conservative
synagogue said I was

52:16.571 --> 52:18.305
the best student he's ever had.

52:19.574 --> 52:24.211
When you do the mikveh,
are you planning to be naked

52:24.311 --> 52:25.913
in the mikveh?

52:26.413 --> 52:28.248
I'll probably wear a one-piece.

52:28.348 --> 52:29.884
Show some modesty.

52:30.417 --> 52:32.720
Mm-mm.
No. No, no, no.

52:33.220 --> 52:35.255
Because I read
that in order to be, like,

52:35.355 --> 52:37.558
officially,
really the most Jewish

52:37.659 --> 52:40.561
you can be,
you gotta be totally nude.

52:40.662 --> 52:44.766
So there's no barrier
between you and God.

52:45.800 --> 52:48.536
You know, and then you gotta
lather yourself in olive oil.

52:48.936 --> 52:50.104
It's a whole thing.

52:50.203 --> 52:51.371
That's not a thing, Agnes.

52:51.471 --> 52:53.173
Is it, like,
Greek Orthodox, or--

52:53.273 --> 52:55.043
No, it's a thing.

52:55.143 --> 52:57.779
I read it
in this very important

52:57.879 --> 53:02.650
and sacred Talmudic text
that I have here.

53:04.686 --> 53:07.855
So, I'm going to do
it right when I mikveh.

53:08.523 --> 53:11.626
And I am gonna lube
up in my birthday suit.

53:15.897 --> 53:17.230
<i>Chag sameach.</i>

53:17.330 --> 53:19.466
Ah, here comes the lox.

53:19.567 --> 53:21.268
-Here comes the lox.
-Morty!

53:21.368 --> 53:22.603
Wow, that looks great, Dad.

53:22.704 --> 53:24.739
There it is, there it is.

53:24.839 --> 53:26.007
Beautiful.

53:26.107 --> 53:27.274
An hour waiting at Zabar's.

53:27.374 --> 53:29.077
-Worth the wait.
-Worth the wait.

53:47.962 --> 53:50.397
Do you think it's
this hard to assemble a crib?

53:50.497 --> 53:55.235
I hope not. I think
this is my favorite holiday.

53:56.137 --> 53:57.839
What does it mean, Sukkot?

53:59.306 --> 54:05.947
Well, <i>sukkah</i> means booth,
or tabernacle.

54:06.047 --> 54:11.552
Um, and Sukkot literally
means "feast of the booths."

54:12.687 --> 54:14.321
It sounds better in Hebrew.

54:15.455 --> 54:16.758
Yeah,
"feast of the booths"

54:16.858 --> 54:18.993
doesn't really roll
off the tongue, does it?

54:19.093 --> 54:20.327
Mm-mm.

54:21.028 --> 54:24.297
Jews really need to do a better
job marketing their holidays.

54:24.397 --> 54:26.167
If I had known
about this when I was a kid

54:26.266 --> 54:28.569
I would've
made Nate build one for me.

54:30.738 --> 54:31.939
Sukkot...

54:32.673 --> 54:36.010
is supposed to be all about
the beauty of impermanence.

54:36.409 --> 54:38.546
It's supposed
to teach us to love

54:38.646 --> 54:41.783
what we have while we have it.

54:45.953 --> 54:47.855
What do you
want to be for Halloween?

54:49.456 --> 54:54.427
I want to be skinny
and fat Karl Lagerfeld.

54:55.663 --> 54:57.665
Karl Lagerfeld had a fat phase?

54:58.266 --> 54:59.700
Oh, yeah.

55:03.137 --> 55:05.006
Big time.

55:05.106 --> 55:08.009
<i>♪ You got the love, huh, yeah,</i>
<i>you know we do it better ♪</i>

55:08.109 --> 55:11.145
<i>♪ You got the love, huh, yeah,</i>
<i>you know we do it right ♪</i>

55:11.245 --> 55:14.215
<i>♪ You got the hook, huh, oh,</i>
<i>you know we play it better ♪</i>

55:14.314 --> 55:17.785
<i>♪ You got the hook, yeah, oh,</i>
<i>you know we play it right ♪</i>

55:57.725 --> 56:02.697
Great job. You are all
getting very good at that.

56:02.797 --> 56:04.065
Come on, Jews.

56:07.134 --> 56:08.368
All right.

56:09.604 --> 56:12.106
Now that we've made
it through the High Holy Days,

56:12.773 --> 56:16.110
I'd like to take
this class to address a pair

56:16.210 --> 56:19.580
of emotionally charged topics.

56:21.115 --> 56:25.119
Anti-Semitism and the Holocaust.

56:29.991 --> 56:33.628
Raise your hand if you've
ever experienced antisemitism.

56:39.000 --> 56:43.871
We're told now that
antisemitism isn't prevalent,

56:43.971 --> 56:46.173
at least not
in our liberal elite circles

56:46.274 --> 56:48.676
and the safe haven of New York.

56:49.510 --> 56:52.947
Hitler used dog whistling
to unite his base.

56:53.614 --> 56:56.317
To unite
the Nazis against the Jews.

56:56.416 --> 57:01.421
To fan the pre-existing flames
of racism and ethnic division.

57:02.957 --> 57:06.527
When the conservative
politicians of today reference,

57:06.894 --> 57:09.163
for example,
the liberal media,

57:09.830 --> 57:13.167
who exactly is it do you think
that they are referring to?

57:17.238 --> 57:18.940
The Jews.

57:19.607 --> 57:21.441
That's who
they're referring to.

57:21.542 --> 57:23.844
And look, I don't
want to sound alarmist,

57:23.945 --> 57:28.215
but if the purpose
of studying history is to teach

57:28.316 --> 57:32.954
us lessons about the present,
we must never forget the past.

57:33.421 --> 57:35.756
And we must, as Jews,

57:35.856 --> 57:37.658
but more importantly
as human beings,

57:37.758 --> 57:41.662
keep holding
that mirror up and demanding

57:41.762 --> 57:44.497
accountability
from our politicians,

57:44.598 --> 57:48.569
demanding an end to centuries
of structural racism,

57:48.669 --> 57:52.273
and demanding justice
and equality

57:52.373 --> 57:54.942
from all intuitions,
great and small.

57:58.646 --> 58:01.749
Thank you,
that was so inspiring.

58:02.883 --> 58:05.119
I wasn't done,
but you're welcome.

58:05.886 --> 58:07.888
- Sorry.
- Sit down, Agnes.

58:07.989 --> 58:09.223
Okay.

58:11.125 --> 58:12.560
<i>Oy vey.</i>

58:13.427 --> 58:15.696
All right,
who's doing their Davar today?

58:17.398 --> 58:20.101
Sumi, thank you.
The floor is yours.

58:56.437 --> 58:57.872
I love you.

59:18.659 --> 59:20.461
I'll be your director today.

59:20.561 --> 59:21.729
Nice to meet you.

59:21.829 --> 59:23.397
Oh, hello.

59:23.497 --> 59:25.332
You know,
I've always wanted

59:25.433 --> 59:26.600
to try my hand at making movies.

59:26.700 --> 59:29.336
So, you...
better be good.

59:30.738 --> 59:32.740
No, seriously,
don't screw this up.

59:34.075 --> 59:36.911
She's really down and out,
like some pimp has cut her up

59:37.011 --> 59:38.579
real good,
so the blood needs

59:38.679 --> 59:43.250
to start here and come
all the way down here.

59:43.350 --> 59:45.486
And make it as thick
and horrible as you possibly can

59:45.586 --> 59:48.055
so that it shows
up really good on camera.

59:48.155 --> 59:49.490
Thanks, Orato.

59:49.590 --> 59:51.092
You know what, um,
and make sure you don't

59:51.192 --> 59:53.562
forget to black
out the front tooth.

59:54.061 --> 59:55.796
All right, sit still, please.

59:56.330 --> 59:57.598
-Like this?
-Don't talk.

59:57.698 --> 1:00:01.268
And try not
to breathe so much.

1:00:02.970 --> 1:00:04.305
Great.

1:00:04.405 --> 1:00:07.074
I'll see you guys on,
uh, set, in ten, for rehearsal.

1:00:07.576 --> 1:00:09.009
Thanks, Orato.

1:00:25.359 --> 1:00:28.629
Out walking the streets so late?

1:00:29.830 --> 1:00:33.033
How'd it go?
The filming.

1:00:33.701 --> 1:00:35.169
It wasn't so great.

1:00:35.537 --> 1:00:37.738
Oh, bet you were fantastic.

1:00:37.838 --> 1:00:40.509
How-- how are you feeling,
my dear?

1:00:40.609 --> 1:00:43.644
Mm. I'm okay, I guess.

1:00:44.845 --> 1:00:46.780
How's the play going?

1:00:46.881 --> 1:00:50.151
It's not.
I gave up on it.

1:00:50.718 --> 1:00:53.387
But the first
act was so brilliant.

1:00:53.754 --> 1:00:58.025
The-- the denouement
at the dinner table flows

1:00:58.125 --> 1:01:01.829
so naturally into the final act.

1:01:01.929 --> 1:01:06.133
You must ride into the pain.

1:01:06.233 --> 1:01:09.336
It's the only way
to get to the glory.

1:01:09.436 --> 1:01:10.838
What's the point, Nate?

1:01:10.938 --> 1:01:13.874
Even if I finish it,
no one's gonna read it.

1:01:14.609 --> 1:01:15.843
What am
I supposed to do with it?

1:01:15.943 --> 1:01:17.678
Rent out
a dilapidated old theater

1:01:17.778 --> 1:01:20.281
with money I don't
have and put it on myself?

1:01:20.381 --> 1:01:22.183
<i>Exactement.</i>

1:01:22.551 --> 1:01:23.884
Face the music, Nate.

1:01:23.984 --> 1:01:26.287
I'm gonna end up like
one of those nutso mimes

1:01:26.387 --> 1:01:28.590
muttering to myself
in Times Square and--

1:01:29.056 --> 1:01:31.859
My poor, illegitimate child
will pretend not to know me.

1:01:31.959 --> 1:01:35.664
Your child
will be very legitimate.

1:01:35.763 --> 1:01:37.498
You're getting married.

1:01:38.232 --> 1:01:42.036
I haven't been
to Times Square in a while.

1:01:42.604 --> 1:01:46.006
It sounds wonderfully macabre.

1:01:47.576 --> 1:01:49.109
You're not disappointed in me?

1:01:49.210 --> 1:01:50.110
No.

1:01:50.211 --> 1:01:52.479
You don't think
I should've gone

1:01:52.581 --> 1:01:54.815
to grad school
or law school or...

1:01:54.915 --> 1:01:58.185
med school?
I got an A in biology.

1:01:58.886 --> 1:02:02.957
You hate hospitals,
and you cry every time

1:02:03.057 --> 1:02:05.059
you get your blood drawn.

1:02:06.026 --> 1:02:07.428
It's the lighting.

1:02:07.529 --> 1:02:09.496
Hospitals
have terrible lighting.

1:02:11.465 --> 1:02:14.235
You don't think I'm wasting
my expensive education?

1:02:15.369 --> 1:02:20.174
To waste a great talent
like yours would be a crime.

1:02:20.542 --> 1:02:24.912
We need art.
Now. More than ever.

1:02:28.349 --> 1:02:30.451
What do you
want for Christmas, Pa?

1:02:31.018 --> 1:02:33.387
To chase you around the block.

1:02:34.054 --> 1:02:35.422
That could be arranged.

1:02:37.592 --> 1:02:39.159
Merry Christmas, by the way.

1:02:40.528 --> 1:02:42.096
Merry Christmas.

1:02:44.231 --> 1:02:45.466
My darling.

1:02:58.178 --> 1:02:59.847
Christmas
can be a challenging

1:02:59.947 --> 1:03:02.883
time for those of us
who have converted

1:03:02.983 --> 1:03:05.786
or those of us who are
partnered with someone

1:03:05.886 --> 1:03:08.055
who loves Christmas
and is used to celebrating.

1:03:08.155 --> 1:03:09.923
I mean, Christmas is everywhere.

1:03:10.024 --> 1:03:13.360
The ads, Santa,
Mariah, let's talk about it.

1:03:13.460 --> 1:03:16.930
How are we feeling?
Yes, um, Mary, then Jordan.

1:03:17.031 --> 1:03:22.836
Yes, thank you. Uh, hi.
Uh, well, I-- I love Christmas.

1:03:23.370 --> 1:03:26.974
The pine needles...
it's all so magical.

1:03:28.275 --> 1:03:30.512
Getting to bounce
on Santa's lap,

1:03:30.612 --> 1:03:32.212
And--

1:03:32.313 --> 1:03:35.015
The Christmas tree is an affront
to everything I believe in.

1:03:35.517 --> 1:03:38.218
If I, a proud Jewish man,
were to allow Mary to have one

1:03:38.319 --> 1:03:41.422
in our apartment, I'd be
letting down my ancestors.

1:03:43.257 --> 1:03:45.326
My grandfather was
shot into the Danube

1:03:45.426 --> 1:03:47.261
by the Nazis because
he wouldn't conform.

1:03:48.028 --> 1:03:49.798
Because he wouldn't
hide his menorah.

1:03:49.897 --> 1:03:52.966
So, if I buy a tree,
it makes his death in vain.

1:03:53.834 --> 1:03:55.570
That makes no sense, Jordan.

1:03:55.670 --> 1:03:57.438
You should
let Mary have her tree.

1:03:57.539 --> 1:04:00.608
Okay, hold on, Agnes.
Jordan, say more about that.

1:04:01.075 --> 1:04:02.843
And why is that, Agnes?

1:04:03.277 --> 1:04:06.213
Well, it makes her happy.
Isn't that worth something?

1:04:06.313 --> 1:04:08.415
Making the person
you love happy?

1:04:08.949 --> 1:04:10.652
And, secondly,
Christmas trees

1:04:10.752 --> 1:04:13.987
are rooted in Pagan ritual,
so they have absolutely nothing

1:04:14.088 --> 1:04:16.558
to do with Jesus Christ,
who was actually born in April,

1:04:16.658 --> 1:04:18.025
not on Christmas Day.

1:04:18.125 --> 1:04:19.694
It's secular capitalism at work.

1:04:19.794 --> 1:04:21.428
Of course,
Christianity has co-opted

1:04:21.529 --> 1:04:24.498
some of those traditions,
but that's beside the point.

1:04:24.599 --> 1:04:26.467
And thirdly,
with all due respect, Jordan,

1:04:26.568 --> 1:04:28.670
your grandfather was shot
into the Danube not because

1:04:28.770 --> 1:04:32.339
he was religious, but because
he was ethnically Jewish.

1:04:32.439 --> 1:04:34.108
The Holocaust
was about ethnic cleansing.

1:04:34.208 --> 1:04:36.310
Hitler didn't care
what you did for the holidays.

1:05:02.503 --> 1:05:06.974
Do you think that, uh,
we can take the Christmas tree

1:05:07.074 --> 1:05:09.209
down before
my parents come over tonight?

1:05:10.177 --> 1:05:11.613
Are you kidding me?

1:05:11.979 --> 1:05:14.415
I'm fine with the tree.
I like Christmas trees.

1:05:14.516 --> 1:05:17.084
I love the way it smells,
but my parents won't get it.

1:05:17.184 --> 1:05:19.754
Especially because
they think you're converting.

1:05:19.854 --> 1:05:20.988
I am converting.

1:05:21.355 --> 1:05:22.824
Right, that's
the confusing part.

1:05:23.390 --> 1:05:26.260
Christmas can
be a secular holiday.

1:05:27.294 --> 1:05:29.329
Well, no, it can't.
Not for everyone.

1:05:29.898 --> 1:05:31.432
Oh, my God.
You sound like Jordan.

1:05:32.667 --> 1:05:33.768
Seriously?

1:05:34.168 --> 1:05:35.737
Yeah, I don't know,
this is all just

1:05:35.837 --> 1:05:38.338
very confusing for me right now.

1:05:38.972 --> 1:05:40.274
How so?

1:05:40.775 --> 1:05:43.944
Could you just pass the pepper,
because we have to pepper them?

1:05:45.979 --> 1:05:47.147
Can we just keep it simple

1:05:47.247 --> 1:05:48.716
and take the tree down?

1:05:48.817 --> 1:05:50.785
They come over, we put
it back up when they leave?

1:05:50.885 --> 1:05:52.554
When are you going
to stop trying so hard

1:05:52.654 --> 1:05:54.121
to please your parents?

1:05:55.122 --> 1:05:56.891
I love my parents.

1:05:56.990 --> 1:05:58.992
And I love you
and I wanna keep the tree up.

1:05:59.092 --> 1:06:00.762
Fine!
Then keep the-- tree up.

1:06:00.862 --> 1:06:03.096
Fine.
We're keeping it up.

1:06:07.134 --> 1:06:09.036
Jesus Christ.

1:06:15.710 --> 1:06:17.177
This is green.

1:06:17.277 --> 1:06:19.480
-What is--
-Yeah, it's green tea.

1:06:19.581 --> 1:06:20.648
It's green tea.

1:06:21.716 --> 1:06:23.050
Take a glab.

1:06:23.150 --> 1:06:24.586
Oh, you know what,
I already have a stack,

1:06:24.686 --> 1:06:26.119
-but I'll take another one.
-Yeah, pass them on.

1:06:26.220 --> 1:06:29.256
Why not? Why not?
Hey, is Agnes doing okay?

1:06:30.057 --> 1:06:32.627
She's never okay.
I don't know. I don't know.

1:06:45.172 --> 1:06:46.708
Agnes, that's the dessert!

1:06:48.977 --> 1:06:50.410
I thought it was a breadstick.

1:06:50.512 --> 1:06:54.081
It's a salted quinoa
straw for the agave caipirinhas.

1:06:56.350 --> 1:06:59.086
Sorry.
I'm starving.

1:07:00.120 --> 1:07:01.321
She's the only person who's

1:07:01.421 --> 1:07:03.156
never heard
of a salted quinoa straw.

1:07:03.257 --> 1:07:04.859
-I know, I know.
-It's always about her.

1:07:04.959 --> 1:07:07.227
You-- you-- Yeah.

1:07:37.525 --> 1:07:38.760
Sorry.

1:07:59.047 --> 1:08:00.280
I don't know
where Abe is getting that,

1:08:00.380 --> 1:08:01.616
because
we don't have a tree.

1:08:01.716 --> 1:08:03.785
Uh, we're not
celebrating Christmas,

1:08:03.885 --> 1:08:06.353
we don't intend on celebrating
Christmas, our children are not

1:08:06.453 --> 1:08:09.524
gonna celebrate Christmas,
and so, that's all just--

1:08:10.257 --> 1:08:11.626
it's made up.

1:08:11.726 --> 1:08:13.393
All right,
well, uh, Glaucia Eduarda

1:08:13.493 --> 1:08:16.263
and Abe have already thought
about Hebrew schools.

1:08:16.363 --> 1:08:17.599
- That's great.
- Can you believe it?

1:08:17.699 --> 1:08:19.433
She's not even pregnant,
as far as I know.

1:08:19.534 --> 1:08:20.835
-Hi, Morty.
-Oh, Agnes!

1:08:20.935 --> 1:08:22.436
Are you
having a good time?

1:08:22.537 --> 1:08:25.305
No, as it turns out.
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1:08:25.405 --> 1:08:26.641
Yeah.

1:08:41.022 --> 1:08:42.624
What's up?

1:08:42.724 --> 1:08:44.157
You lied.

1:08:45.225 --> 1:08:47.996
What are you talking about?

1:08:48.730 --> 1:08:50.698
You said we didn't
celebrate Christmas.

1:08:51.198 --> 1:08:53.101
I just said that
to keep everybody happy.

1:08:53.200 --> 1:08:54.869
You know,
we can obviously do whatever

1:08:54.969 --> 1:08:56.136
we want to do in private.

1:08:56.236 --> 1:08:57.772
I don't want to live like that.

1:08:58.205 --> 1:09:01.809
I don't want to lie.
Can we just go home?

1:09:02.275 --> 1:09:05.479
I'm the best man, Agnes.
I can't just leave the wedding.

1:09:05.580 --> 1:09:07.247
So, we have to stay
for the entire reception?

1:09:07.347 --> 1:09:09.117
Yeah, I don't want
to just rush out on these guys.

1:09:09.216 --> 1:09:10.518
I feel like I'm always rushing.

1:09:10.618 --> 1:09:12.452
Rushing out?
We're never rushing out on them.

1:09:12.553 --> 1:09:14.122
Oh, and thanks for defending me
back there with breadstick-gate.

1:09:14.221 --> 1:09:15.790
It's not a big deal, Agnes.

1:09:15.890 --> 1:09:18.291
Yeah, it didn't have
to be a big deal until Abe made

1:09:18.392 --> 1:09:21.095
it a big deal by calling
me out in front of everyone.

1:09:21.663 --> 1:09:23.665
Those two are
the most self-absorbed

1:09:24.231 --> 1:09:25.499
people on the planet.

1:09:25.600 --> 1:09:27.935
He's my brother, and I love him.

1:09:28.402 --> 1:09:30.071
Glaucia, I have
to learn to accept--

1:09:30.170 --> 1:09:32.740
Look, I know when you needed to
get sober he helped you a lot,

1:09:32.840 --> 1:09:34.408
but if he can't be there

1:09:34.509 --> 1:09:37.078
to celebrate your successes
and the happiness in your life--

1:09:37.177 --> 1:09:38.746
What are you even talking about?

1:09:39.147 --> 1:09:42.182
And why would you
bring that up right now?

1:09:42.282 --> 1:09:44.719
I-- this...
I can't do this anymore.

1:09:45.119 --> 1:09:46.353
What are you saying?

1:09:46.453 --> 1:09:48.255
This.
You clearly want nothing to do

1:09:48.355 --> 1:09:50.058
with my family
and our traditions.

1:09:50.158 --> 1:09:52.727
Oh, my God,
that is so wildly unfair.

1:09:52.827 --> 1:09:56.396
I'm literally in the process
of converting to your religion.

1:09:56.496 --> 1:09:58.533
It's not just a religion, Agnes.

1:09:58.633 --> 1:10:00.267
That's the thing
that you don't understand.

1:10:00.367 --> 1:10:02.436
To me, being Jewish
is a huge part of who I am.

1:10:02.537 --> 1:10:05.840
It's about family, it's about
bread-breaking, tribal unity.

1:10:05.940 --> 1:10:07.274
I know all about bread-breaking.

1:10:07.374 --> 1:10:09.043
We broke bread
at the convent all the time.

1:10:09.143 --> 1:10:12.479
-I love bread.
-It's not a joke, Agnes.

1:10:13.346 --> 1:10:14.816
So, we can't even laugh anymore?

1:10:15.983 --> 1:10:18.351
I'm the one who's
bending over backwards here,

1:10:18.452 --> 1:10:21.589
solely because
I want to be with you.

1:10:23.356 --> 1:10:25.292
Do you know
that 72% of modern Jews

1:10:25.392 --> 1:10:26.728
are intermarrying, by the way?

1:10:26.828 --> 1:10:28.096
What the hell
does that mean?

1:10:28.196 --> 1:10:29.597
It means a lot
of people do it,

1:10:29.697 --> 1:10:31.799
so don't just bail
because it gets challenging.

1:10:31.899 --> 1:10:33.134
I'm the one who's bailing?

1:10:33.634 --> 1:10:35.469
Let me give
you a statistic:

1:10:35.570 --> 1:10:37.805
the last Holocaust survivors
will be dead in a couple years.

1:10:37.905 --> 1:10:40.041
And that's relevant
to this conversation because?

1:10:40.141 --> 1:10:42.610
How do you not
understand how that's relevant?

1:10:43.911 --> 1:10:45.179
Is this about Israel?

1:10:45.278 --> 1:10:46.881
It's about terminal,
ethnic identity.

1:10:46.981 --> 1:10:49.517
-What?
-Herbert Gans.

1:10:49.617 --> 1:10:51.384
He's on the syllabus,
why don't you read it?

1:10:51.485 --> 1:10:53.121
Wow.
That's really condescending.

1:10:53.221 --> 1:10:54.622
It's not a good look on you.

1:10:54.722 --> 1:10:56.356
You know, this is why
people don't do this.

1:10:56.456 --> 1:10:57.959
I didn't get it before.
I thought,

1:10:58.059 --> 1:11:00.628
"This is so messed up,
you can't decide who you fall

1:11:00.728 --> 1:11:03.197
in love with," but now it's
starting to make sense to me.

1:11:03.564 --> 1:11:05.600
Maybe this is all
just a little too hard.

1:11:08.002 --> 1:11:09.436
What about our baby?

1:11:12.039 --> 1:11:14.374
Maybe we co-parent... the baby.

1:11:14.942 --> 1:11:16.844
We shouldn't just get
married because of the baby,

1:11:16.944 --> 1:11:18.278
that never works.

1:11:18.378 --> 1:11:20.715
Maybe co-parenting
would be better because

1:11:20.815 --> 1:11:22.449
we wouldn't
be fighting all the time.

1:11:22.550 --> 1:11:25.253
We're there, so, um,
I think I'm going to go now.

1:11:25.352 --> 1:11:28.856
You should stay
and we should talk about it.

1:11:29.223 --> 1:11:30.892
No, I'll make it easier for you.

1:11:31.491 --> 1:11:34.394
We're done.
Crisis averted.

1:11:35.062 --> 1:11:38.498
So, now you can be
free to go and marry Daphna

1:11:38.599 --> 1:11:40.101
and have lots of Jewish babies.

1:11:40.201 --> 1:11:42.335
I don't want to marry Daphna--
you need to calm down.

1:11:42.435 --> 1:11:44.337
I'm perfectly calm!

1:12:17.138 --> 1:12:19.106
<i>Agnes?</i>
<i>It's Fred.</i>

1:12:19.207 --> 1:12:20.675
What's wrong?

1:12:20.775 --> 1:12:23.211
<i>Your</i> dziadekpassed
<i>away last night.</i>

1:12:23.311 --> 1:12:25.079
<i>In his sleep.</i>

1:12:25.179 --> 1:12:31.351
<i>They say it was natural</i>
<i>causes, no disease, no pain.</i>

1:12:32.687 --> 1:12:35.756
<i>I'm very sorry for your sadness.</i>

1:12:35.857 --> 1:12:38.759
<i>You must be present</i>
<i>with the pain of the loss.</i>

1:12:39.293 --> 1:12:41.095
<i>Do not avoid it.</i>

1:14:13.220 --> 1:14:14.655
Agnes, are you okay?

1:14:15.256 --> 1:14:16.991
Oh, God.

1:14:22.196 --> 1:14:23.631
Everything's gonna be all right.

1:14:25.266 --> 1:14:26.534
How do you know that?

1:14:28.636 --> 1:14:30.071
You have to have faith.

1:14:36.077 --> 1:14:37.144
It's okay.

1:14:40.514 --> 1:14:41.782
Levi.

1:14:44.318 --> 1:14:45.519
Levi!

1:14:45.619 --> 1:14:48.856
Levi? Oh, my God,
what a coincidence.

1:14:48.956 --> 1:14:52.026
Oh, my God. Daphna.
I am actually so busy right now.

1:14:52.126 --> 1:14:53.561
What are you doing here?

1:14:53.661 --> 1:14:56.664
Oh, Glaucia told me
you were living in the hood.

1:14:57.497 --> 1:15:00.701
How fun was the first wedding?

1:15:01.369 --> 1:15:02.803
It was great.

1:15:03.437 --> 1:15:05.339
Oh, I am so sorry to hear

1:15:05.439 --> 1:15:07.274
that you and Agnes broke up.

1:15:08.476 --> 1:15:10.077
Thanks, yeah, it's been rough.

1:15:10.745 --> 1:15:13.147
You know,
I've gotten really deep

1:15:13.247 --> 1:15:16.650
into Kabbalah recently,
and everyone's born

1:15:16.751 --> 1:15:19.086
to be the hero
of their own lives, right?

1:15:19.453 --> 1:15:21.088
And I just think
it's really important,

1:15:21.188 --> 1:15:24.658
as a Jewish woman,
to raise one's own children

1:15:24.759 --> 1:15:27.161
according
to one's own faith, right?

1:15:28.729 --> 1:15:31.198
Sorry, um, what?

1:15:31.599 --> 1:15:34.435
Oh, about
raising children in the faith?

1:15:34.535 --> 1:15:36.737
Well, according
to one faith, right?

1:15:36.837 --> 1:15:38.039
Um, you know what, I have to go.

1:15:38.139 --> 1:15:39.673
I have got to get
back to the office.

1:15:39.774 --> 1:15:41.175
Oh, sure, yeah.
I'll come with you.

1:15:41.275 --> 1:15:42.610
Okay.

1:15:42.710 --> 1:15:44.145
So, yeah,
all this, like, modern,

1:15:44.245 --> 1:15:47.348
liberal Judaism, uh, uh,
like taking bits and pieces

1:15:47.448 --> 1:15:50.418
of what one likes, like
celebrating Christmas, you know,

1:15:50.519 --> 1:15:52.053
is not right.

1:15:52.153 --> 1:15:54.588
<i>... key topics in the ongoing</i>

1:15:54.688 --> 1:15:57.024
<i>debate about</i>
<i>the global climate crisis,</i>

1:15:57.124 --> 1:16:00.261
<i>including carbon offsetting</i>
<i>and carbon taxing,</i>

<i>investing in renewable</i>
<i>energies and fracking.</i>

1:16:03.764 --> 1:16:06.967
<i>As these leaders negotiate</i>
<i>compromises and tariffs,</i>

1:16:07.068 --> 1:16:09.770

1:16:18.379 --> 1:16:21.749

1:16:28.355 --> 1:16:29.524
Hello?

1:16:29.623 --> 1:16:31.325
<i>Hey, it's Everett.</i>

1:16:31.425 --> 1:16:33.528
<i>You're coming over to my place</i>

1:16:33.627 --> 1:16:35.596
<i>And maybe a jam session,</i>

1:16:35.696 --> 1:16:37.131
<i>We'll see</i>
<i>where the night takes us.</i>

1:16:37.865 --> 1:16:43.804
Um, I'm sorry, I... I can't.
I'm, uh... busy.

1:16:43.904 --> 1:16:46.340
<i>Get off the couch now.</i>

1:16:46.440 --> 1:16:47.608
<i>I'm texting you the address.</i>

1:16:49.910 --> 1:16:51.278
<i>... catastrophic</i>

1:16:51.378 --> 1:16:52.813
<i>environmental disaster.</i>

1:16:58.553 --> 1:17:00.555
You know, in recovery,
we have a saying.

1:17:00.921 --> 1:17:02.524
I know all about the sayings.

1:17:02.623 --> 1:17:05.359
Well, when a person shows

1:17:05.459 --> 1:17:08.129
you who they are, believe them.

1:17:08.696 --> 1:17:10.131
So true.

1:17:12.266 --> 1:17:15.870
I have an idea. Um, can
we forget about earlier today?

1:17:16.403 --> 1:17:18.339
Hey, look, what-- what happens
in the honeywagon

1:17:18.439 --> 1:17:20.374
stays in the honeywagon.

1:17:20.474 --> 1:17:22.776
Listen, I just
want you to be okay.

1:17:22.877 --> 1:17:25.045
I didn't know that you were
going through any of this stuff.

1:17:26.013 --> 1:17:27.982
I'm sorry to hear
about your grandfather.

1:17:29.717 --> 1:17:32.753
I'm an unwed
mother-to-be and an orphan.

1:17:33.687 --> 1:17:35.456
Little orphan Agnes.

1:17:35.557 --> 1:17:36.991
Hmm.

1:17:37.691 --> 1:17:39.093
All right,
listen, screw the labels.

1:17:39.193 --> 1:17:41.295
And I'm sorry, I--
I shouldn't have said--

1:17:41.395 --> 1:17:42.564
that wasn't funny at all.

1:17:42.663 --> 1:17:44.465
No, I thought it was very funny.

1:17:47.001 --> 1:17:49.069
Did you ever have
a relationship with your father?

1:17:49.170 --> 1:17:51.172
I met him once.
He's nice enough.

1:17:51.872 --> 1:17:53.307
He's a vagabond, sort of.

1:17:54.074 --> 1:17:56.043
He never wanted
to have a child, so...

1:17:56.777 --> 1:17:58.212
And what about your grandmother?

1:17:58.846 --> 1:18:01.949
She died about a year
after my mother overdosed.

1:18:02.617 --> 1:18:03.817
Technically,
it was cancer,

1:18:03.918 --> 1:18:06.020
but I think it was grief.

1:18:08.189 --> 1:18:10.191
I think you're
really talented, Agnes.

1:18:10.592 --> 1:18:12.159
And you can
have a solid career,

1:18:12.259 --> 1:18:14.929
you know, in this, if-- if--
if that's what you wanted to do.

1:18:15.029 --> 1:18:16.797
You don't
have to say that to me.

1:18:17.398 --> 1:18:18.832
I know I don't have to.

1:18:21.101 --> 1:18:22.836
How's that fiancé of yours?

1:18:23.837 --> 1:18:25.306
We called the engagement off.

1:18:26.207 --> 1:18:28.209
Um, I don't know
what's going to happen with us.

1:18:29.210 --> 1:18:31.546
He's on a date right
now with a Jewish woman,

1:18:31.646 --> 1:18:34.081
so there's that,
and this baby is on

1:18:34.181 --> 1:18:36.083
its way whether
I'm ready or not.

1:18:38.587 --> 1:18:43.357
You know, after my wife, um,
passed away, uh, Sparrow and I,

1:18:43.457 --> 1:18:44.626
we, uh...

1:18:44.725 --> 1:18:46.293
we started going to Sunday Mass.

1:18:47.261 --> 1:18:48.495
At first I just--

1:18:49.029 --> 1:18:50.831
I couldn't really
connect to any of it, but....

1:18:51.700 --> 1:18:53.734
I'm actually finding some peace.

1:18:54.268 --> 1:18:57.639
I went to Mass once
a week for 13 years.

1:18:57.738 --> 1:18:59.373
Never brought me any peace.

1:19:01.775 --> 1:19:03.210
Hey, listen.

1:19:04.679 --> 1:19:07.781
I, um... I want to thank you.

1:19:09.383 --> 1:19:10.619
For what?

1:19:11.620 --> 1:19:16.090
Sparrow, she told me that she
could hear you talking to her.

1:19:16.457 --> 1:19:17.891
And that she felt safe.

1:19:19.893 --> 1:19:21.395
Look, I'll never be able
to thank you enough

1:19:21.495 --> 1:19:22.896
for what you did.

1:19:22.997 --> 1:19:24.498
I just did what anyone would do.

1:19:24.599 --> 1:19:25.766
No, no, not anyone.

1:19:25.866 --> 1:19:27.101
You know,
a lot of people they, um,

1:19:27.201 --> 1:19:30.037
they freeze up
in situations like that.

1:19:33.007 --> 1:19:34.576
I remember
the day that she was born.

1:19:35.075 --> 1:19:37.344
You know, she had to spend,
uh, three weeks in the I.C.U.

1:19:38.812 --> 1:19:42.950
She was blue.
And so tiny, oh, my God.

1:19:43.817 --> 1:19:45.152
And she was so beautiful.

1:19:45.252 --> 1:19:48.556
She already had a full
head of hair, even then.

1:19:51.792 --> 1:19:53.294
I was constantly traveling.

1:19:54.128 --> 1:19:57.331
And ever since then I've been
trying to make it up to her.

1:19:57.699 --> 1:20:00.067
And Sparrow,
she's, uh-- she's a kid,

1:20:00.167 --> 1:20:01.935
so she's already
forgiven me for my...

1:20:02.469 --> 1:20:05.372
my terrible
parenting so early in her life.

1:20:05.472 --> 1:20:07.408
Um...

1:20:07.908 --> 1:20:09.410
She's exceptional.

1:20:10.745 --> 1:20:12.179
Yeah.

1:20:13.314 --> 1:20:16.551
Do you have, um,
any plans after this?

1:20:18.252 --> 1:20:19.788
Yeah, I have a couple
more dates.

1:20:20.287 --> 1:20:21.790
Oh, this is--
is that what this is?

1:20:21.889 --> 1:20:23.223
I don't know.

1:20:23.658 --> 1:20:27.595
Just thought you were a jaded,
rockstar dad taking pity on me.

1:20:27.696 --> 1:20:30.565
Oh, you think I'm jaded?
That's a bit of a cliché, no?

1:20:30.665 --> 1:20:32.600
Clichés are cliché for a reason.

1:20:32.966 --> 1:20:35.869
Right. Well...

1:20:36.705 --> 1:20:38.138
I do not pity you.

1:20:38.740 --> 1:20:41.275
I like you.

1:20:56.758 --> 1:20:58.058
Whoa, whoa.

1:20:58.158 --> 1:20:59.594
What's up? You okay?

1:20:59.694 --> 1:21:01.862
Um, nothing,
I'm-- yeah, I just, I--

1:21:01.962 --> 1:21:03.565
I think I'm going to be sick.

1:21:04.465 --> 1:21:06.367
-Physically ill.
-Uh...

1:21:06.467 --> 1:21:07.602
Oh, my God.

1:21:07.702 --> 1:21:09.436
Um, all right, well, the, um...

1:21:09.537 --> 1:21:11.506
the bathroom is--
it's down the hall to the right.

1:21:20.447 --> 1:21:21.516
Oh.

1:21:24.952 --> 1:21:26.654
Agnes, are you okay?

1:21:27.555 --> 1:21:28.823
Never been better.

1:21:28.922 --> 1:21:30.324
All right, come on.
Get up.

1:21:31.158 --> 1:21:32.960
And what if this
is where I belong?

1:21:34.261 --> 1:21:35.797
Come on,
let's get you to bed.

1:21:35.896 --> 1:21:37.799
Is your blood sugar low?
Do you need a snack?

1:21:38.298 --> 1:21:41.001
This is where I deserve
to sleep. I'm a toilet person.

1:21:41.101 --> 1:21:42.804
-No, come on.
-I'm a sewer lady.

1:21:42.903 --> 1:21:44.071
Come on.

1:21:44.171 --> 1:21:45.540
Where are you taking me?

1:21:45.640 --> 1:21:47.408
I'm putting you to bed.
I'm picking you up.

1:21:47.876 --> 1:21:49.343
Putting me to bed, eh?

1:21:49.443 --> 1:21:50.845
In the guest room.

1:21:50.944 --> 1:21:52.847
-Come on.
-Vomiting pregnant lady

1:21:52.946 --> 1:21:54.516
goes to the guest room,
I get it.

1:21:54.616 --> 1:21:56.049
Yes, you do.

1:22:47.434 --> 1:22:49.470
Oh, my goodness,
this is so heavy.

1:22:49.871 --> 1:22:53.307
Um, oh, this is so overwhelming.
What an incredible honor.

1:22:53.741 --> 1:22:57.044
First, I'd like to thank Yahweh
for giving me the gift of life.

1:22:57.545 --> 1:22:59.948
Then, of course, the Academy.
Thank you for voting for me.

1:23:00.047 --> 1:23:03.083
And, uh, let's not
forget Tilda Swinton,

1:23:03.183 --> 1:23:05.419
my adoptive
mother and best friend.

1:23:05.520 --> 1:23:08.756
Tilda, I could not have done
this without-- Oh, my God.

1:23:09.423 --> 1:23:12.660
I, um... sorry.
I was going to put it back.

1:23:13.093 --> 1:23:14.529
I wasn't going to steal it.

1:23:17.632 --> 1:23:19.166
Best original song.

1:23:19.634 --> 1:23:20.969
Congratulations.

1:23:21.068 --> 1:23:22.336
Thanks.

1:23:22.436 --> 1:23:24.238
You know,
Tilda's a really cool lady,

1:23:24.338 --> 1:23:26.808
and I'll introduce the two
of you next time she's in town.

1:23:27.274 --> 1:23:28.710
Well, that'd be great.

1:23:30.678 --> 1:23:32.112
I have to head to set.

1:23:33.013 --> 1:23:34.782
Okay.
Thanks again.

1:23:35.148 --> 1:23:36.584
All right, bye.

1:23:56.303 --> 1:23:59.206
Agnes, did you
have a sleepover with Daddy?

1:23:59.306 --> 1:24:02.075
Hi, Sparrow.
What are you doing here?

1:24:02.175 --> 1:24:05.780
What do you mean what am
I doing here? This is my house.

1:24:06.213 --> 1:24:08.348
Of course.
No, I'm sorry, you're right.

1:24:08.448 --> 1:24:11.084
Um, sorry, I'm just
a bit cloudy this morning.

1:24:11.184 --> 1:24:13.655
Did you have a bad dream?

1:24:14.556 --> 1:24:16.524
Yes, actually.

1:24:16.891 --> 1:24:18.660
Those are the worst,
but it's okay,

1:24:18.760 --> 1:24:22.129
because you're awake now,
and none of that is real.

1:24:22.229 --> 1:24:23.631
Do you want some of my cereal?

1:24:24.032 --> 1:24:26.400
Sure.
Thanks.

1:24:29.837 --> 1:24:31.371
Coffee?

1:24:31.471 --> 1:24:34.542
Sure, thank you. You're
a very good hostess, Sparrow.

1:24:38.580 --> 1:24:40.180
There we go.

1:24:46.721 --> 1:24:48.255
That's regular milk,

1:24:48.355 --> 1:24:53.293
but we have almond,
hemp and oat as well.

1:24:54.127 --> 1:24:55.462
Regular is perfect.

1:24:55.563 --> 1:24:56.798
Thank you.

1:24:57.599 --> 1:25:01.435
Oh, here's a clue.
Finally. This one is hard.

1:25:01.536 --> 1:25:04.005
Yeah. But you got
through the maze, look at that.

1:25:04.772 --> 1:25:07.041
Sparrow,
honey, we've got to get going.

1:25:07.140 --> 1:25:08.576
You're going to be late.

1:25:09.376 --> 1:25:11.478
I have physical therapy now.

1:25:12.312 --> 1:25:14.381
And then school.

1:25:14.882 --> 1:25:16.350
Have a great day.

1:25:16.751 --> 1:25:18.019
I love you.

1:25:18.452 --> 1:25:20.021
Love you, too.

1:25:20.120 --> 1:25:22.056
Don't drink
too much coffee, okay?

1:25:22.155 --> 1:25:24.525
Daddy says
it makes you crazy hyper,

1:25:24.626 --> 1:25:26.861
and it's not good for the baby.

1:25:39.239 --> 1:25:40.675
I went to school with him.

1:25:41.643 --> 1:25:42.744
Hmm.

1:25:42.844 --> 1:25:44.177
Oh.

1:25:45.013 --> 1:25:46.480
Is that talking Ed?

1:25:47.214 --> 1:25:48.750
Yeah, he's a journalist.

1:25:48.850 --> 1:25:51.119
You know, travels the world
telling important stories.

1:25:51.753 --> 1:25:53.988
Does something
valuable for society.

1:25:54.354 --> 1:25:56.256
Uh, debatable.

1:25:56.356 --> 1:25:57.759
Oh, I'm such a failure.

1:25:58.425 --> 1:26:00.494
You seem sad, baby doll.

1:26:00.928 --> 1:26:02.496
Really?
You're so perceptive.

1:26:02.597 --> 1:26:06.801
Why so snippy?
Not so snippy. Gosh.

1:26:07.167 --> 1:26:10.104
I'm sorry.

1:26:10.203 --> 1:26:11.706
It's just the hormones, and...

1:26:12.507 --> 1:26:14.307
well, there's
a lot to be sad about.

1:26:14.408 --> 1:26:18.046
Polar ice caps are melting,
our oceans are full of trash,

1:26:18.146 --> 1:26:20.815
my baby daddy doesn't love me
because I'm not Jewish enough.

1:26:20.915 --> 1:26:23.985
There's always something to
be sad about. What else is new?

1:26:24.351 --> 1:26:28.355
This is an awful show.
what are we watching?

1:26:28.455 --> 1:26:30.158
It's called the news, Sheldon.

1:26:30.257 --> 1:26:31.759
It's so depressing!

1:26:33.460 --> 1:26:34.494
Ugh!

1:26:34.595 --> 1:26:36.263
And when is
this phone gonna ring?

1:26:36.698 --> 1:26:38.265
It'll pick up.

1:26:39.199 --> 1:26:40.935
How are you so optimistic?

1:26:41.368 --> 1:26:46.674
Well, what are my choices?
We're here, we're alive.

1:26:47.340 --> 1:26:50.545
To steal a phrase
from Rabbi Ben Hayhay

1:26:50.645 --> 1:26:52.279
that my Bubbie
used to repeat to me

1:26:52.379 --> 1:26:56.617
all the time:

1:26:58.285 --> 1:26:59.887
I didn't know you were Jewish.

1:27:01.388 --> 1:27:03.290
Hello?
We're theater people.

1:27:03.691 --> 1:27:05.927
We eat the brisket
on a bi-weekly basis.

1:27:06.027 --> 1:27:07.895
Well, I knew you were
culturally Jewish, but I didn't

1:27:07.995 --> 1:27:11.165
know you were, like,
religious, practicing Jews.

1:27:11.699 --> 1:27:13.801
We practice when she chooses.

1:27:13.901 --> 1:27:15.603
When the spirit moves me.

1:27:15.703 --> 1:27:18.271
We did love the music
at that East Side Synagogue.

1:27:18.371 --> 1:27:21.075
Oh...
I miss going there.

1:27:21.175 --> 1:27:22.510
Hmm.

1:27:22.610 --> 1:27:24.145
Fantastic gospel singers.

1:27:24.244 --> 1:27:25.680
The best.

1:27:26.313 --> 1:27:27.982
Gospel? In shul?

1:27:28.082 --> 1:27:32.186
Are you converting, Agnes?
Maybe help your career.

1:27:32.553 --> 1:27:34.287
That's a loaded question.

1:27:35.957 --> 1:27:37.825
What does it mean? That quote.

1:27:38.291 --> 1:27:42.563
According
to the effort is the reward.

1:27:43.531 --> 1:27:47.869
Persistence
is the only thing in this life.

1:27:47.969 --> 1:27:50.605
To survive, you--
you-- you keep going.

1:27:51.005 --> 1:27:53.908
And we're rewarded, ultimately.

1:27:55.109 --> 1:27:56.276
We're flipping channels, here.

1:27:56.376 --> 1:27:57.945
How are we being rewarded?

1:27:58.345 --> 1:28:00.815
Well, sometimes
waiting is part of the effort.

1:28:02.216 --> 1:28:03.785
I put in a lot of effort.

1:28:03.885 --> 1:28:05.352
Where's my reward?

1:28:05.452 --> 1:28:08.022
Coleslaw and a new bra.

1:28:08.122 --> 1:28:12.425
Oh, in fact, I'm ordering you
a pretty lilac one as we speak.

1:28:12.527 --> 1:28:14.162
That'll be
your reward for the day.

1:28:14.562 --> 1:28:16.130
I don't want
a lilac bra and I don't

1:28:16.230 --> 1:28:17.464
want to eat the coleslaw.

1:28:17.565 --> 1:28:21.301
Eat the coleslaw.
Mm, isn't this something?

1:28:21.401 --> 1:28:23.470
Makes you almost believe in God.

1:28:24.172 --> 1:28:25.773
I believe in Zabar's.

1:28:26.607 --> 1:28:28.441
I didn't know
you believed in God, Maude.

1:28:28.810 --> 1:28:30.511
I said almost.

Ow.

1:30:30.631 --> 1:30:32.133
- This relationship--
- Actually right

1:30:32.233 --> 1:30:33.466
when you broke up.

1:30:33.567 --> 1:30:37.504
Oy, I am so full.

1:30:37.605 --> 1:30:39.707
I think you're going to have
to cut me out of my dress.

1:30:39.807 --> 1:30:42.009
That's the great thing
about maternity clothes,

1:30:42.109 --> 1:30:43.277
it's all stretch.

1:30:47.815 --> 1:30:49.684
Thank you for coming tonight.

1:30:49.784 --> 1:30:51.185
Thanks for having me.

1:30:51.285 --> 1:30:54.487
This was really beautiful
and food was delicious.

1:30:54.588 --> 1:30:56.023
I needed this.

1:30:56.757 --> 1:31:01.195
I heard that, uh,
because of the breakup

1:31:01.295 --> 1:31:06.167
and the baby, you weren't
going to be returning to class.

1:31:07.301 --> 1:31:13.908
So, I wanted to offer in-person,
if it's useful to you.

1:31:14.508 --> 1:31:16.110
To continue meeting.

1:31:16.811 --> 1:31:19.547
If you want to continue
your journey through Judaism.

1:31:20.047 --> 1:31:21.481
I'd like that.

1:31:26.354 --> 1:31:30.825
Hey. You're gonna have a baby.

1:31:32.727 --> 1:31:34.128
It's exciting, isn't it?

1:31:34.595 --> 1:31:35.796
It is, but...

1:31:36.163 --> 1:31:38.232
the thought
of doing it on my own is--

1:31:38.866 --> 1:31:41.736
Hey, you're
not gonna be on your own.

1:31:42.169 --> 1:31:45.172
Even if you and Levi don't get
back together, you have friends.

1:31:45.539 --> 1:31:48.275
You have me. I'm serious.

1:31:48.376 --> 1:31:49.710
Babies love me,
and the Schneiders will

1:31:49.810 --> 1:31:51.245
be great grandparents.

1:31:51.345 --> 1:31:53.981
And yeah, Levi will be
a good dad no matter what.

1:32:01.989 --> 1:32:07.395
You may have noticed
that Jews make a really

1:32:07.495 --> 1:32:12.500
big deal out
of funerals and death

1:32:12.600 --> 1:32:16.704
and dying which,
to some, can seem grim, but...

1:32:16.804 --> 1:32:20.207
I know. Levi's parents go to,
like, two funerals a week.

1:32:20.307 --> 1:32:22.276
They love them. It's like
they have season tickets.

1:32:22.376 --> 1:32:24.245
Okay, to outsiders...

1:32:25.112 --> 1:32:27.681
especially those who grew
up believing in the afterlife,

1:32:27.782 --> 1:32:30.684
the Jewish language
around death and the rituals

1:32:30.785 --> 1:32:33.020
around grieving
can seem excessive.

1:32:34.255 --> 1:32:39.193
But for us,
death is finite.

1:32:39.660 --> 1:32:42.797
It's a full stop.
Someone we love is gone forever.

1:32:42.897 --> 1:32:44.565
That's why we mourn so much.

1:32:44.665 --> 1:32:47.001
We're not going to see
them again in another life.

1:32:49.136 --> 1:32:52.807
With each new life
we reexperience the miracle

1:32:52.907 --> 1:32:55.709
of creation and reaffirm
our covenant with God.

1:32:56.844 --> 1:33:00.214
Death is poignant
because life is fleeting.

1:33:03.984 --> 1:33:06.555
Look, I don't
know if I'll ever be

1:33:06.654 --> 1:33:07.855
a religious person,

1:33:07.955 --> 1:33:10.691
I don't know if I'll convert.

1:33:11.058 --> 1:33:13.994
Um, the kind
of commitment that you're

1:33:14.095 --> 1:33:16.197
asking for,
it scares me, to be honest,

1:33:16.297 --> 1:33:20.334
but what I do know
is that I want to keep learning.

1:33:21.068 --> 1:33:23.871
And I'd like to keep
studying with you if I can.

1:33:27.475 --> 1:33:28.909
Okay.

1:33:29.910 --> 1:33:32.613
I'll email you a schedule and we
can pick up where we left off.

1:33:32.713 --> 1:33:34.148
Get back to work.

1:33:35.616 --> 1:33:39.120
-Great.
-Until then, macaroon?

1:33:40.654 --> 1:33:42.089
Why not?

1:33:44.625 --> 1:33:46.260
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1:33:48.162 --> 1:33:49.330
<i>L'chaim.</i>

1:33:49.430 --> 1:33:50.664
Mm, <i>l'chaim.</i>

1:33:50.764 --> 1:33:52.133
-Remember-- remember <i>l'chaim?</i>
-Yes.

1:33:55.102 --> 1:33:58.339
Hey, Dad. Oh, sorry.
I'll come back later.

1:33:58.439 --> 1:33:59.840
No, no, no, come on in.

1:33:59.940 --> 1:34:01.709
I was just, uh,
finishing my morning prayers.

1:34:03.043 --> 1:34:05.246
I have to go
build a crib at home.

1:34:05.346 --> 1:34:06.548
Mm-hmm.

1:34:06.647 --> 1:34:09.250
At Agnes's...
uh, in the nursery.

1:34:09.350 --> 1:34:14.655
Um, I feel like she should
stay at our place with the baby.

1:34:14.755 --> 1:34:18.058
Ah, come on in
and sit for a minute. Come on.

1:34:20.694 --> 1:34:22.129
Okay.

1:34:23.264 --> 1:34:26.934
Do you know what the purpose
of praying with tefillin is?

1:34:27.668 --> 1:34:29.538
To remind us of the Exodus.

1:34:30.104 --> 1:34:33.774
Ah, for me,
it reminds me of the things

1:34:33.874 --> 1:34:35.976
in life that bind me together.

1:34:36.076 --> 1:34:38.647
The people that ground me.

1:34:39.013 --> 1:34:42.082
Your mother,
you and your siblings,

1:34:42.850 --> 1:34:45.286
uh, and the love
that I have for all of you.

1:34:45.753 --> 1:34:48.389
And, uh,
Glaucia Eduarda and Agnes, too.

1:34:48.489 --> 1:34:54.328
-We all love Agnes.
-I love Agnes, too. A lot.

1:34:55.062 --> 1:34:57.198
But it's not going to work.

1:34:58.165 --> 1:34:59.900
I mean, we're
going to co-parent,

1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:02.770
but we're not
going to be together.

1:35:03.572 --> 1:35:04.905
What does that even mean?

1:35:05.005 --> 1:35:06.807
It means we're
gonna take turns parenting.

1:35:07.408 --> 1:35:10.277
We're gonna see each other,
but we're not gonna get married.

1:35:10.377 --> 1:35:13.914
Look, Dad, I don't
really want to talk about it.

1:35:15.015 --> 1:35:18.520
Well, I-- I'm
very sorry to hear that.

1:35:18.953 --> 1:35:20.321
Yeah, you're
not thrilled that now

1:35:20.421 --> 1:35:21.656
I can marry some Jewish girl?

1:35:22.189 --> 1:35:24.792
No, no, no, no, no,
I think you've misunderstood.

1:35:24.892 --> 1:35:26.193
I've heard this lecture before--

1:35:26.293 --> 1:35:29.263
Was I disappointed
when both of my sons were

1:35:29.363 --> 1:35:32.399
in serious relationships
with non-Jewish girls?

1:35:32.499 --> 1:35:35.069
Yes. I was, at first.

1:35:35.469 --> 1:35:39.406
It was a-- a-- a fear of losing
or diluting our heritage.

1:35:39.507 --> 1:35:44.445
A fear that was instilled
in me when I was a child.

1:35:44.546 --> 1:35:45.746
My father--

1:35:45.846 --> 1:35:47.481
I know,
he died in the Holocaust,

1:35:47.582 --> 1:35:50.884
and that's why I'm not
going to dishonor that legacy.

1:35:50.985 --> 1:35:52.486
What, that's what you think?

1:35:53.287 --> 1:35:55.724
That that's what would
happen if you married Agnes?

1:35:56.090 --> 1:36:00.361
Levi, life is difficult enough.

1:36:00.729 --> 1:36:02.997
Why make it harder for yourself?

1:36:03.097 --> 1:36:05.199
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

1:36:06.033 --> 1:36:08.902
Do you know why Jews
emphasize marrying other Jews?

1:36:09.003 --> 1:36:10.371
To keep the tribe alive.

1:36:10.471 --> 1:36:14.509
It's a mantra perpetuated
and motivated by fear.

1:36:16.010 --> 1:36:20.814
And making decisions based
on fear can only back you up

1:36:20.914 --> 1:36:24.285
further into the prison
you were hoping to escape from.

1:36:27.054 --> 1:36:31.025
I-- I can see that
you and Agnes are in love.

1:36:31.593 --> 1:36:36.063
The way she looks at you from
across the room, you're in love.

1:36:37.498 --> 1:36:39.500
And you have become a man.

1:36:40.301 --> 1:36:42.936
It didn't happen
at your Bar Mitzvah.

1:36:44.038 --> 1:36:46.974
It happened when you met Agnes.

1:36:48.442 --> 1:36:50.612
I had no idea
that you felt this way.

1:36:51.378 --> 1:36:55.115
Well... come
and chat with me more often.

1:36:55.215 --> 1:36:58.886
What I have to say,
it might surprise you.

1:37:02.524 --> 1:37:04.825
When I look at you, Levi,

1:37:07.061 --> 1:37:09.863
I am filled with <i>nachas.</i>

1:37:11.566 --> 1:37:14.101
You remember that word
from Hebrew school, yes?

1:37:14.769 --> 1:37:16.203
It means you're proud of me.

1:37:16.738 --> 1:37:19.541
Proud, I-- Proud? I'm beaming.

1:37:20.040 --> 1:37:24.945
I'm all filled up.
I love you.

1:37:27.549 --> 1:37:28.982
Love you, too, Dad.

1:37:38.125 --> 1:37:39.860
Where'd Aunt Millie
go this time?

1:37:40.928 --> 1:37:42.530
Mm, Bhutan.

1:37:43.297 --> 1:37:45.567
Last time she was
trying to find herself

1:37:45.667 --> 1:37:47.101
she was gone for three years,

1:37:47.201 --> 1:37:49.269
so hopefully
I'll be here for a while.

1:37:53.941 --> 1:37:56.611
Okay, I'm serious,
do whatever you want to it.

1:37:57.444 --> 1:37:59.413
You should see
what I did to the nursery.

1:37:59.913 --> 1:38:02.049
Seriously, Agnes,
it's already screwed up.

1:38:02.149 --> 1:38:03.585
I think it's luminous.

1:38:04.586 --> 1:38:07.321
Do something to it,
please, I'm begging you.

1:38:09.056 --> 1:38:13.026
Okay.
If you insist.

1:38:13.460 --> 1:38:14.895
I insist.

1:38:16.163 --> 1:38:17.398
Hmm.

1:38:19.066 --> 1:38:21.235
So, uh, where's Levi staying?

1:38:21.803 --> 1:38:23.370
At his parents' place.

1:38:24.873 --> 1:38:26.541
We texted
to coordinate Ernie's pickup

1:38:26.641 --> 1:38:29.644
and drop-off schedule,
but it was strained.

1:38:32.479 --> 1:38:36.684
I'm just a terrible
person who messes everything up.

1:38:39.486 --> 1:38:40.688
Does he know about Nate?

1:38:40.789 --> 1:38:42.322
Yes, I had to tell him.

1:38:42.423 --> 1:38:44.391
And you're not a messed-up
person, you're just having

1:38:44.491 --> 1:38:46.661
a terrible time
and a terrible wedding.

1:38:56.203 --> 1:38:57.605
Everett texted me.

1:38:58.105 --> 1:38:59.541
What does it say?

1:38:59.641 --> 1:39:01.074
"I hope you're feeling better.

1:39:01.175 --> 1:39:03.410
I'm around if you ever need
to talk to someone.

1:39:03.912 --> 1:39:06.548
Take care. E."

1:39:06.648 --> 1:39:08.315
Ooh, "Take care."
Brutal.

1:39:09.717 --> 1:39:12.720
It's like I don't know
how to <i>be</i> without Levi.

1:39:15.322 --> 1:39:16.957
What should I write back?

1:39:17.759 --> 1:39:19.259
"New phone, who's this?"

1:39:20.027 --> 1:39:22.095
It's all going to be okay,
you know that, right?

1:39:24.198 --> 1:39:26.668
Okay, what the hell
did you do to my work of art?

1:39:26.768 --> 1:39:28.202
You're kidding me, right?

1:39:29.369 --> 1:39:30.538
Yes.

1:39:30.638 --> 1:39:31.940
I actually kinda like it.

1:39:32.473 --> 1:39:34.609
Yes, I think
the crimson adds a--

1:39:34.709 --> 1:39:36.076
a warmth to it.

1:39:36.176 --> 1:39:37.779
-Dewy dynamic, tension--
-Sh, sh-sh-sh.

1:39:37.879 --> 1:39:39.112
It's okay.

1:39:39.213 --> 1:39:40.715
-Sorry.
-You can stay here,

1:39:40.815 --> 1:39:43.217
but you have
to just shut up and eat.

1:39:43.984 --> 1:39:45.419
Roger Roger.

1:39:46.754 --> 1:39:48.989
Oh, come on, just say
it and then I'll shut up.

1:39:51.759 --> 1:39:52.961
Over over.

1:39:53.060 --> 1:39:54.495
Clearance Clarence.

1:39:56.063 --> 1:39:57.397
Satisfied?

1:39:57.498 --> 1:39:58.733
For now.

1:40:57.525 --> 1:40:59.326
And to show
our reluctance to say

1:40:59.426 --> 1:41:03.463
this final farewell, we start
with the shovel upside down.

1:42:45.566 --> 1:42:47.702
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

1:42:47.802 --> 1:42:49.837
No, I am not okay!

1:42:49.937 --> 1:42:51.105
I'm dead!

1:42:51.204 --> 1:42:52.472
No, no,
you're not dead,

1:42:52.573 --> 1:42:57.078
you're just in the grave.
Um, hold on.

1:42:57.177 --> 1:42:59.246
Help is on the way.

1:43:06.521 --> 1:43:09.256
It's not as bad as I thought

1:43:09.356 --> 1:43:10.892
it would be down here.

1:43:13.326 --> 1:43:18.066
It's gonna be okay.
Don't cry.

1:43:18.432 --> 1:43:19.934
Bubbie's in a better place.

1:43:20.400 --> 1:43:22.970
If you believe in that.
I, personally, do not.

1:43:24.138 --> 1:43:25.573
Abe and I are sorry.

1:43:26.306 --> 1:43:28.308
Daphna's
my only real girlfriend.

1:43:28.408 --> 1:43:29.644
I had noticed that, yes.

1:43:29.744 --> 1:43:31.344
No, no,
what I'm trying to say is...

1:43:31.813 --> 1:43:33.815
we-- I--

1:43:35.016 --> 1:43:36.450
We miss you.

1:43:38.553 --> 1:43:41.455
Abe and I are working
on being more thoughtful.

1:43:42.123 --> 1:43:43.558
Levi's been so sad.

1:43:44.058 --> 1:43:46.961
I just think that you need
to go out with him and talk.

1:43:47.061 --> 1:43:48.896
He's been smoking.

1:43:48.996 --> 1:43:51.465
-Crack or meth?
-Cigarettes.

1:43:51.566 --> 1:43:54.068
Mm, that's good. Meth is
a real gateway drug for him.

1:43:54.669 --> 1:43:56.470
What was he addicted
to to begin with?

1:43:56.571 --> 1:44:00.675
None of your business.
Well, he did a lot of drugs.

1:44:00.775 --> 1:44:03.111
Most of the drugs
slash all of the drugs

1:44:03.211 --> 1:44:04.444
at one point or another.

1:44:04.545 --> 1:44:05.913
Wait, what happened
to your accent?

1:44:06.279 --> 1:44:08.415
Okay, please don't hate me.

1:44:08.516 --> 1:44:13.253
Please. But I'm actually
from New Jersey.

1:44:14.789 --> 1:44:16.557
Wait, what?
Why would you lie about that?

1:44:16.657 --> 1:44:19.160
I mean, so many legends
are from New Jersey.

1:44:19.259 --> 1:44:22.897
Cory Booker,
Meryl Streep, Bruce Springsteen.

1:44:22.997 --> 1:44:25.265
I just thought
that I'd be more successful

1:44:25.365 --> 1:44:27.835
if I had a more chic,
international identity.

1:44:27.935 --> 1:44:29.402
Does Abe know?

1:44:29.503 --> 1:44:31.371
I came clean to him
a few months into seeing him.

1:44:31.739 --> 1:44:34.642
He understood,
and supported my persona

1:44:34.742 --> 1:44:36.611
-as a savvy business choice.
-Of course he did.

1:44:36.711 --> 1:44:38.513
I just kept
thinking that if I got

1:44:38.613 --> 1:44:41.015
ahead in my career,
I'd be happy.

1:44:41.716 --> 1:44:44.484
And somewhere along the way
I forgot to be compassionate.

1:44:45.285 --> 1:44:46.587
Or authentic.

1:44:46.687 --> 1:44:48.756
Which is the whole
point of my industry.

1:44:49.190 --> 1:44:50.558
When you say industry,

1:44:50.658 --> 1:44:53.261
which industry
exactly are you referring to?

1:44:53.360 --> 1:44:55.462
And I can't truly be a--
a-- a successful healer

1:44:55.563 --> 1:44:57.832
without that.
Without empathy.

1:44:59.399 --> 1:45:01.936
I started therapy, finally.

1:45:02.369 --> 1:45:04.539
I've been
diagnosed as orthorexic.

1:45:04.972 --> 1:45:06.240
It's an eating disorder.

1:45:06.339 --> 1:45:08.276
It essentially
means you eat too well.

1:45:08.810 --> 1:45:11.179
I still don't entirely
get what's wrong with that,

1:45:11.279 --> 1:45:12.713
but whatever.

1:45:14.347 --> 1:45:16.050
I ate a cheeseburger yesterday.

1:45:16.483 --> 1:45:18.719
You didn't meet
the blessed cow first?

1:45:18.820 --> 1:45:21.923
I went to Shake Shack
and I ate three burgers

1:45:22.023 --> 1:45:24.625
and five orders of French
fries and I just sat there

1:45:24.725 --> 1:45:27.528
in the middle of the street
just stuffing my face with meat.

1:45:27.929 --> 1:45:31.331
That's great.
That's a big step forward.

1:45:31.431 --> 1:45:32.767
I mean, it's exposure therapy.

1:45:32.867 --> 1:45:34.334
Sounds like you've
really hit rock bottom.

1:45:34.434 --> 1:45:39.307
I mean, we've...
literally hit rock bottom.

1:45:39.874 --> 1:45:44.444
Yeah. About that.
Let's get out of here.

1:45:45.012 --> 1:45:46.180
I'll give you a boost.

1:45:46.714 --> 1:45:48.149
I should give
you the first boost. Really.

1:45:48.249 --> 1:45:49.884
No, no, don't be silly.

1:45:51.152 --> 1:45:53.254
Wait, actually I am
getting kind of freaked out

1:45:53.353 --> 1:45:54.956
down here
and I'm the pregnant one,

1:45:55.056 --> 1:45:57.658
so, maybe, yeah. Okay.

1:46:13.741 --> 1:46:16.611
Water on the bridge.
That's the expression, right?

1:46:16.978 --> 1:46:18.846
Under the bridge, I believe.

1:46:32.593 --> 1:46:34.528
I'm so
sorry that we lost Bubbie.

1:46:37.298 --> 1:46:40.635
I was devastated
to hear about Nate.

1:46:42.136 --> 1:46:45.973
The idea of eternity
is actually really upsetting.

1:46:46.073 --> 1:46:49.577
I mean, the thought of all of us
living somewhere else

1:46:50.111 --> 1:46:53.446
together forever,
it's not actually comforting,

1:46:53.547 --> 1:46:55.883
even though it seems
like it kind of should be.

1:46:59.620 --> 1:47:02.056
I should've never
let you leave that night.

1:47:03.490 --> 1:47:05.126
It wasn't entirely your fault.

1:47:06.426 --> 1:47:09.330
I'm-- I know
I can overreact and...

1:47:09.797 --> 1:47:11.232
I just felt like
you weren't hearing me.

1:47:11.332 --> 1:47:14.302
You're right.
I wasn't listening.

1:47:14.402 --> 1:47:16.037
And I should've
said something to Abe.

1:47:16.137 --> 1:47:18.005
He was out of line.

1:47:18.940 --> 1:47:22.209
I'm sorry, Agnes, and I'm sorry
for asking you to pretend.

1:47:23.945 --> 1:47:25.179
I'm sorry, too.

1:47:27.648 --> 1:47:29.884
Glaucia and I made up, actually.

1:47:29.984 --> 1:47:31.385
She apologized.

1:47:31.484 --> 1:47:32.954
In the grave?

1:47:33.054 --> 1:47:34.622
Nowhere to go but up.

1:47:35.823 --> 1:47:38.092
Well, that's good. I guess.

1:47:39.760 --> 1:47:43.764
Look, I don't want you to be
anybody other than who you are.

1:47:45.066 --> 1:47:48.169
And I want to be with you
and with Ernie.

1:47:52.440 --> 1:47:53.874
Please marry me.

1:47:54.942 --> 1:47:56.844
Please. And...

1:47:58.012 --> 1:48:00.581
I don't want
you to convert or any of that.

1:48:03.384 --> 1:48:04.919
I want to marry you, too.

1:48:05.019 --> 1:48:07.822
And you should
know that I've still

1:48:07.922 --> 1:48:09.390
been taking
classes with Rabbi Cohen,

1:48:09.757 --> 1:48:13.027
and as it turns out,
I'm actually already Jewish.

1:48:14.195 --> 1:48:15.529
Nate left me a letter.

1:48:15.629 --> 1:48:18.366
He changed his name
from Wilderman to Wild

1:48:18.466 --> 1:48:20.034
when he became an actor.

1:48:23.503 --> 1:48:25.072
It actually kind of makes sense.

1:48:27.475 --> 1:48:29.010
But you went to Catholic school.

1:48:30.077 --> 1:48:32.847
He said he lived
in a time when antisemitism

1:48:32.947 --> 1:48:34.882
was even more prevalent
and he thought his life

1:48:34.982 --> 1:48:38.252
would just be simpler
if he changed his last name.

1:48:39.954 --> 1:48:41.756
You know what's funny,
I went to Catholic school

1:48:41.856 --> 1:48:44.558
only to end up at Jewish school
with you, only to find out

1:48:44.658 --> 1:48:47.795
that I was already
who I thought I was, all along.

1:48:50.097 --> 1:48:54.568
And very unimportant
side note, but I made out

1:48:54.668 --> 1:48:57.038
with, um,
Everett James and puked

1:48:57.138 --> 1:49:00.841
and, uh, slept in his guest
bedroom and held his Oscar.

1:49:01.709 --> 1:49:05.312
The award that
he keeps in his guest bedroom

1:49:05.413 --> 1:49:07.948
where I slept
and where he did not.

1:49:11.652 --> 1:49:13.721
I hate that.

1:49:15.589 --> 1:49:17.024
You went out with Daphna.

1:49:17.458 --> 1:49:18.692
That's actually different.

1:49:19.293 --> 1:49:22.531
She's a stalker.
She's, like, an actual stalker.

1:49:22.630 --> 1:49:24.098
Oh, my God,
you dramatize it so much.

1:49:24.198 --> 1:49:25.666
She's not stalking you.

1:49:38.179 --> 1:49:40.681
Agnes and Levi.

1:49:43.117 --> 1:49:44.351
Oh, my God.

1:49:45.886 --> 1:49:47.288
Oh, my God. It's happening.

1:49:47.388 --> 1:49:48.589
Oh, my God.

1:49:48.689 --> 1:49:50.724
It's happening?
Call an ambulance.

1:49:51.125 --> 1:49:52.593
Call an ambulance.

1:49:52.693 --> 1:49:54.161
We don't need an ambulance,
just a moving vehicle.

1:49:54.261 --> 1:49:55.396
Moving vehicle.

1:50:01.735 --> 1:50:05.406
Next up we have
Theodore Nathaniel Schneider

1:50:05.506 --> 1:50:07.641
presenting on Buddhism.

1:50:14.014 --> 1:50:16.617
We made the bald cap
out of a pair of pantyhose.

1:50:17.218 --> 1:50:18.619
I like that.

1:50:20.888 --> 1:50:22.790
Mum, Dad,
can you sit right here?

1:50:30.698 --> 1:50:32.233
I would like
to start my discussion

1:50:32.333 --> 1:50:34.101
with the Four Noble Truths.

1:50:34.201 --> 1:50:36.403
While prominent
in the Theravada strain

1:50:36.504 --> 1:50:37.905
of contemporary
Buddhist thought,

1:50:38.005 --> 1:50:40.641
these truths
serve as an essential

1:50:40.741 --> 1:50:44.311
and necessary function
of any Buddhist practice.

1:50:44.678 --> 1:50:46.447
I, myself,
find them very useful

1:50:46.548 --> 1:50:49.483
to combat the stress of
my every day fourth grade life.

1:50:49.850 --> 1:50:53.888
Homework, crushes, planning
my birthday parties, etc.

1:50:53.988 --> 1:50:56.790
Like when Billy Bostick
makes fun of me in math class.

1:50:56.891 --> 1:51:00.127
That's not something
I'm gonna dwell on because,

1:51:00.227 --> 1:51:01.996
if you strive to live
in the moment,

1:51:02.096 --> 1:51:05.232
as I do,
then these four truths,

1:51:05.332 --> 1:51:09.170
these four laws, or rules,
I like to refer to them,

1:51:09.270 --> 1:51:13.207
shouldn't necessarily
govern to how you see the world.

1:51:14.842 --> 1:51:19.548
We all experience
anxiety, sadness and loss.

1:51:19.914 --> 1:51:21.583
That's how we know we're alive.

1:51:22.149 --> 1:51:25.953
And I'm here
to educate you about Buddhism,

1:51:26.320 --> 1:51:28.189
and to remind you that

1:51:28.289 --> 1:51:30.858
spirituality
is something separate.

1:51:30.958 --> 1:51:33.027
Something personal to you.

1:51:33.460 --> 1:51:36.063
And I'm here to tell you
that everything will turn out

1:51:36.163 --> 1:51:40.535
okay if you believe
in the truth and have compassion

1:51:41.268 --> 1:51:45.773
and just, you know, love
yourself and your neighbors,

1:51:46.407 --> 1:51:48.108
and everything will
turn out as it should.

1:51:48.709 --> 1:51:53.515
And the world will be a better
place because you lived in it.

1:52:25.079 --> 1:52:27.248
Oh, oh, you're scaring
her with that nose.

1:52:27.348 --> 1:52:28.583
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.

1:52:28.683 --> 1:52:30.284
It's not Rudolph.
Atlantis, it's Daddy.

1:52:32.253 --> 1:52:34.755
Honey, she--
she doesn't look happy.

1:52:34.855 --> 1:52:36.691
What's that smell?

1:52:36.790 --> 1:52:38.560
Oh. Did you
bring the poop diary?

1:52:38.660 --> 1:52:40.394
Oh.
Poop diary.

1:52:40.494 --> 1:52:41.929
Do we have cloth diapers?

1:52:44.699 --> 1:52:47.067
Weird. They're weird.

1:52:48.737 --> 1:52:50.137
Who's winning?

1:52:50.237 --> 1:52:53.007
Uh, so far, I am.
I-- I don't know how that...

1:52:53.107 --> 1:52:55.009
-how that happens.
-Here, it kinda matches.

1:52:55.109 --> 1:52:58.312
All right, I'm going
with a more traditional.

1:53:00.914 --> 1:53:03.551
Here we go.
I'm gonna get a drink.

1:53:03.652 --> 1:53:04.885
Yeah.
Eggnog.

1:53:04.985 --> 1:53:06.420
Yeah, eggnog.

1:53:09.658 --> 1:53:12.059
Merry Hannukah.

1:53:14.028 --> 1:53:17.331
Hi, honey.
Where ya been?

1:53:17.431 --> 1:53:18.866
Cooking.

1:53:19.266 --> 1:53:20.501
Really?

1:53:32.846 --> 1:53:34.415
Oh, very good, Theo.

1:53:34.516 --> 1:53:35.949
Well, now I'm winning.

1:53:39.453 --> 1:53:41.488
Theo, are you robbing
your grandfather blind?

1:53:41.589 --> 1:53:43.023
No.

1:53:45.059 --> 1:53:47.027
I gotta save
that money for college.

1:55:27.060 --> 1:55:29.329
-Woohoo!
-Beautiful. Beautiful.

1:55:29.430 --> 1:55:32.065
Merry Christmas.

1:55:32.166 --> 1:55:34.268
I think that's all
we have to eat.

1:55:34.368 --> 1:55:35.737
What did you--
you brought the--

1:55:35.837 --> 1:55:37.070
My buckwheat biscuits.

1:55:37.171 --> 1:55:38.673
Oh, we gotta take
them out of the oven.

1:55:38.773 --> 1:55:39.940
