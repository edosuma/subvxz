00:01.305 --> 00:03.307
My name is H.G. Wells.

00:03.351 --> 00:05.744
My friend John
is Jack the Ripper.

00:05.788 --> 00:08.182
He's escaped from 1893
in my time machine,

00:08.225 --> 00:10.184
and I am the only one
who can catch him.

00:11.315 --> 00:13.361
I know things about you

00:13.404 --> 00:14.797
that you don't even know
about yourself.

00:14.840 --> 00:16.712
Like the fact
that you have a son.

00:16.755 --> 00:17.974
In Paris.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.062
Henry Ayers.

00:19.106 --> 00:20.063
Impossible.

00:20.107 --> 00:21.543
You asked me
if I believe in fate.

00:21.586 --> 00:23.066
Oh, I believe
very much so

00:23.110 --> 00:25.286
that this moment
was destined to happen.

00:25.329 --> 00:27.201
I understand
you went to my childhood home.

00:27.244 --> 00:28.941
We did overhear your
father talk about his work.

00:28.985 --> 00:30.204
Project Utopia?

00:30.247 --> 00:32.249
I don't know
of any Project Utopia.

00:32.293 --> 00:34.251
Griffin,
Your sister's here.

00:34.295 --> 00:35.774
Brooke. What in the hell
are you doing here?

00:35.818 --> 00:37.820
John escaped.

00:37.863 --> 00:39.996
What happened? You were
supposed to keep him locked up.

00:40.823 --> 00:42.129
I know you.

00:54.315 --> 00:56.491
Good Lord.
What are you looking at?

00:56.534 --> 00:59.276
This is actual footage
from World War I.

00:59.320 --> 01:01.104
It's man versus machine.

01:01.148 --> 01:03.628
It's not war.
It's slaughter.

01:05.152 --> 01:07.371
Why would John go
to such a time?

01:07.415 --> 01:10.157
What was so important in Paris
on March 30, 1918?

01:10.200 --> 01:11.767
Could you open up
that map again?

01:12.811 --> 01:14.074
All we know so far

01:14.117 --> 01:16.206
is that he landed
at Bois de Boulogne Park.

01:16.250 --> 01:18.513
And he could have gone
anywhere from there.

01:18.556 --> 01:21.037
Be impossible to find.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.213
What was happening
on that day?

01:28.000 --> 01:29.959
It was toward
the end of World War I.

01:30.002 --> 01:31.830
The Germans had
a new artillery weapon

01:31.874 --> 01:33.310
called the Paris Gun.

01:33.354 --> 01:34.442
They hid it
in the countryside

01:34.485 --> 01:36.270
and fired it into the city
at random.

01:36.313 --> 01:37.488
Despicable.

01:37.532 --> 01:39.273
Innocent people struck down
at any moment.

01:39.316 --> 01:42.189
You said John spent a year
in Paris at medical school?

01:42.232 --> 01:44.147
Yes, but that was
years earlier, in 1890.

01:44.191 --> 01:46.236
Did he have any friends
or family there?

01:46.280 --> 01:47.411
Not that I recall.

01:48.804 --> 01:50.849
Except, no, there was a --
There was an Englishwoman

01:50.893 --> 01:52.199
who worked
at the medical school.

01:52.242 --> 01:53.504
Uh...
Oh, what's her name?

01:53.548 --> 01:55.724
Pauline.
Pauline Ayers.

01:55.767 --> 01:57.073
He boasted
that they were lovers,

01:57.117 --> 01:58.596
but then it ended
when he went back to London.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.381
That's something.

02:05.690 --> 02:08.040
What's this?

02:08.084 --> 02:10.391
It's her genealogy.

02:10.434 --> 02:12.219
Pauline was only in Paris
a few years,

02:12.262 --> 02:13.481
moved back to England,

02:13.524 --> 02:15.396
worked at a hospital
in Stockport,

02:15.439 --> 02:17.615
died in 1914
of Spanish Flu.

02:17.659 --> 02:21.097
Pauline had a son
born in 1891.

02:22.446 --> 02:25.232
Henry Ayers.
Mother, Pauline.

02:25.275 --> 02:26.624
Father...

02:26.668 --> 02:28.104
John Stevenson.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.932
Whoa.

02:29.975 --> 02:32.195
Impossible.
John never spoke of a son.

02:32.239 --> 02:33.457
Maybe he didn't know.

02:33.501 --> 02:35.416
But a-a woman would
tell a man such a thing.

02:35.459 --> 02:36.678
So she had her reasons.

02:36.721 --> 02:38.767
She easily could have
kept it from him.

02:38.810 --> 02:41.030
So how did he find out?

02:41.073 --> 02:44.860
You can find anything
on the Internet today.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.080
Henry Ayers.

02:48.124 --> 02:50.518
He was a doctor in
the Royal Army Medical Corps,

02:50.561 --> 02:51.910
9th Battalion.

02:51.954 --> 02:54.739
He was stationed in Paris,
killed in action on...

02:54.783 --> 02:57.786
March 30, 1918.

02:57.829 --> 03:00.092
That's it, then.

03:00.136 --> 03:03.313
John's gone back to Paris
to save his son's life.

04:02.938 --> 04:04.548
I found some coats for Jane

04:04.592 --> 04:06.376
and some currency
for you to take.

04:06.420 --> 04:09.031
Ah, excellent.
Thank you.

04:09.074 --> 04:10.032
You're welcome.

04:10.075 --> 04:11.729
How's Griffin?

04:11.773 --> 04:13.427
Oh, John did a number on him,
but he's with the doctor now.

04:13.470 --> 04:14.602
He'll be fine.

04:14.645 --> 04:16.299
Do you know where you're going,
exactly?

04:16.343 --> 04:18.258
Uh, Captain Henry Ayers
was stationed

04:18.301 --> 04:19.520
at the RAC field office
in Paris.

04:19.563 --> 04:20.869
He was part of the deployment

04:20.912 --> 04:22.697
from Paris to Saint Quentin
in the north.

04:22.740 --> 04:24.525
At 11:00 a.m. March 30th,

04:24.568 --> 04:27.310
the motorized transport
carrying Henry got underway.

04:27.354 --> 04:28.703
Shortly after,

04:28.746 --> 04:30.313
it was destroyed by German
artillery bombardment

04:30.357 --> 04:31.749
just outside
the city limits.

04:31.793 --> 04:33.316
All men were lost.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.536
John will try to stop Henry
from getting on that transport.

04:35.579 --> 04:36.928
That's what we have to prevent.

04:36.972 --> 04:39.366
You're gonna stop a man
from saving his son?

04:39.409 --> 04:41.585
As cruel as it sounds,
if his son survives,

04:41.629 --> 04:43.413
there's no foretelling
the damage it would cause.

04:43.457 --> 04:44.936
H.G. is right.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.982
The time ripples it could cause
would be devastating.

04:47.025 --> 04:48.375
I will find him
and bring him back.

04:48.418 --> 04:50.028
John must pay for his actions
in this world,

04:50.072 --> 04:52.292
and I will see to it.

04:52.335 --> 04:54.337
Uh, Vanessa, did you discover

04:54.381 --> 04:55.730
anything more
about Project Utopia?

04:55.773 --> 04:57.471
No, I've been through
my parents' papers,

04:57.514 --> 04:58.515
the corporate archives.

04:58.559 --> 04:59.951
There's no mention of it.

04:59.995 --> 05:02.040
But I reached out to a colleague
of my father's.

05:02.084 --> 05:03.433
I'm gonna go see him.

05:03.477 --> 05:05.087
He was the head of research
in the early years,

05:05.130 --> 05:06.349
so he may know something.

05:07.394 --> 05:09.613
Do you think I could
get away with this in Paris?

05:09.657 --> 05:11.267
Uh, you're not going.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.358
Trust me,
you'll want me there.

05:15.402 --> 05:17.317
Je parle FranÃ§ais.
I spent a semester there.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.492
I know the city inside-out.

05:18.535 --> 05:19.971
But 1918 is a time of war.

05:20.015 --> 05:21.364
Which is exactly why
you need me.

05:21.408 --> 05:23.018
No, it's too dangerous.

05:23.061 --> 05:24.846
What kind of man would I be
if I put a woman in such peril?

05:24.889 --> 05:26.413
This woman can handle
herself.

05:26.456 --> 05:27.849
She's proven it
more than once.

05:27.892 --> 05:30.417
I'm well aware,
but at the risk of sounding --

05:30.460 --> 05:32.070
Like a sexist pig?

05:34.159 --> 05:36.031
I've yet to oink, so I fail to
understand the "pig" reference,

05:36.074 --> 05:38.642
but what I was going to say is
that as a man out of his time --

05:38.686 --> 05:41.253
I went to the '80s.
That wasn't a problem.

05:41.297 --> 05:43.212
I simply must say no.
That's final.

05:46.171 --> 05:47.651
Now, Martin, we can't risk

05:47.695 --> 05:49.566
further destabilization
of the fourth dimension.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.394
You'll sync the time machine
to John's first jump

05:51.438 --> 05:52.439
and send me back
in real time?

05:52.482 --> 05:53.788
You got it.

05:53.831 --> 05:55.572
John landed in Paris
at 6:00 a.m.

05:55.616 --> 05:58.009
Exactly 2 hours and 17 minutes
have passed since then.

05:58.053 --> 05:59.968
Therefore,
I will arrive at 8:17

06:00.011 --> 06:02.536
and have approximately
three hours to stop him.

06:02.579 --> 06:04.320
Will that be enough time?

06:04.364 --> 06:06.235
Henry's flat was
just down the street
from the RAC hospital.

06:06.278 --> 06:07.584
My hope is that
he didn't venture too far

06:07.628 --> 06:09.194
in the hours
before his deployment.

06:09.238 --> 06:11.196
Jane.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.286
Good luck.

06:17.551 --> 06:21.381
I can't risk her life.

06:21.424 --> 06:22.643
She will realize that.

06:22.686 --> 06:25.907
Here, I was able
to track this down for you.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.517
What is this for?

06:27.561 --> 06:28.866
Protection.

06:28.910 --> 06:31.521
It's a 1915 semiautomatic,
fully loaded.

06:31.565 --> 06:33.436
I am not comfortable
taking a gun.

06:33.480 --> 06:34.959
Violence is not the option.

06:35.003 --> 06:37.135
Well, then,
use this to prevent it.

06:39.529 --> 06:41.531
Against
all better judgment.

06:41.575 --> 06:43.403
Wait.

06:43.446 --> 06:44.752
When do you want me to send
the machine back for you?

06:44.795 --> 06:46.057
12:00 noon.

06:46.101 --> 06:48.016
By then, I will have
accomplished my mission...

06:48.059 --> 06:50.410
or failed miserably,
and all will be lost.

07:23.878 --> 07:25.227
Londoner.

07:26.315 --> 07:27.751
Is my accent that dreadful?

07:29.405 --> 07:30.754
I was just down
at the Army hospital,

07:30.798 --> 07:32.539
and they said this is where
many of the doctors

07:32.582 --> 07:33.583
come after their shifts.

07:33.627 --> 07:35.324
Not for very much longer.

07:35.367 --> 07:36.543
The Brits are moving north

07:36.586 --> 07:39.415
to fight the Germans
at Saint Quentin.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.504
You don't happen
to know a doctor

07:41.548 --> 07:43.550
by the name of Henry Ayers,
do you?

07:45.290 --> 07:46.727
I'm an old friend.

07:46.770 --> 07:49.425
I was hoping to bump into him
before he left Paris.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.993
Henry Ayers, huh?

07:52.036 --> 07:53.647
You're friends
with that scoundrel?

07:53.690 --> 07:56.345
So I take it
he's a bit sinister, yeah?

07:56.388 --> 07:57.825
Oh, I could tell you
some stories.

07:57.868 --> 07:59.217
Margot!

08:00.480 --> 08:01.611
Henry, my love!

08:01.655 --> 08:04.788
How about one last drink
for the road?
Ohh!

08:04.832 --> 08:08.009
Ohh!

08:08.052 --> 08:10.533
Careful, he'll sucker you
into paying for the round.

08:10.577 --> 08:13.754
I'm Margot, by the way.
I am this lucky bloke's fiancÃ©e.

08:13.797 --> 08:16.278
Henry Ayers.
Pleased to meet you.

08:17.801 --> 08:19.281
John.

08:19.324 --> 08:21.849
Well, don't be rude.
You don't recognize your friend?

08:21.892 --> 08:23.372
It's quite all right.

08:23.415 --> 08:25.635
I am cursed
with a familiar face.

08:27.681 --> 08:29.770
And I'm cursed
to never forget them.

08:29.813 --> 08:31.336
Are you sure we've met?

08:31.380 --> 08:34.775
In all truth, no.
No, we've not met.

08:34.818 --> 08:36.211
But I've come to find you

08:36.254 --> 08:38.474
because I used to know
your mother, Pauline Ayers.

08:42.086 --> 08:43.697
I'll be damned.

08:43.740 --> 08:45.220
He actually went
to see his son.

08:46.700 --> 08:49.485
You knew he'd go
to 1918 Paris?

08:49.529 --> 08:51.966
I knew he had a son in Paris
who dies in 1918.

08:52.009 --> 08:53.620
I didn't think
he'd actually go.

08:53.663 --> 08:55.752
Why would John care
about having a son?

08:55.796 --> 08:58.581
He's a psychopathic
narcissist.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.583
Something was created
in his image.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.063
His ego...

09:02.106 --> 09:03.151
Ow!

09:03.194 --> 09:04.500
...must seek it out.

09:04.544 --> 09:05.806
Ow!
That hurts.

09:05.849 --> 09:08.112
You should have won
the fight.

09:08.156 --> 09:09.113
He had a knife.

09:09.157 --> 09:10.550
He didn't play fair.

09:10.593 --> 09:11.942
What are you doing?

09:11.986 --> 09:14.641
This treatment is more effective
on a fresh wound.

09:14.684 --> 09:16.120
What treatment?
Aah, Brooke, come on!

09:16.164 --> 09:17.731
You -- You could have
numbed me.

09:19.036 --> 09:20.255
I could have.

09:25.739 --> 09:27.305
Dermis tissue.

09:27.349 --> 09:31.745
Lab-grown
from stem cells.

09:49.240 --> 09:50.285
What the hell?

09:53.288 --> 09:54.898
This is Dad's research.

09:54.942 --> 09:56.639
A basic version of it, yes.

09:56.683 --> 09:59.294
The injection activates
the transfer of genetic code

09:59.337 --> 10:02.558
from the surrounding skin cells
to the undifferentiated tissue.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.299
We could have used this
in Iraq.

10:04.342 --> 10:05.735
Well, pretty soon,

10:05.779 --> 10:07.694
every soldier will be carrying
it in their pocket.

10:07.737 --> 10:10.871
So if that's
the basic version,

10:10.914 --> 10:12.568
what else are you doing
with Dad's research?

10:12.612 --> 10:14.091
Well, look at that.

10:14.135 --> 10:15.702
Griffin's interested
in something other than himself.

10:15.745 --> 10:16.920
No, I'm serious.

10:16.964 --> 10:19.314
What's going on down here?

10:21.751 --> 10:24.624
Would you like to meet
one of my patients?

10:29.716 --> 10:32.762
Nick, this is my brother,
Griffin.

10:32.806 --> 10:34.634
You don't mind
showing off for him, do you?

10:34.677 --> 10:35.722
Not at all.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.945
Does that measure
his grip strength?

10:41.989 --> 10:44.556
Yep.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.733
Whenever you're ready.

11:06.274 --> 11:09.320
That's impossible.

11:09.364 --> 11:11.279
I've developed
an enhancement drug

11:11.322 --> 11:12.889
from his own
genetic makeup.

11:12.933 --> 11:15.762
That number can't be right.

11:15.805 --> 11:17.372
900 pounds means he has --

11:17.415 --> 11:18.982
The strength of six men.

11:20.767 --> 11:23.117
And his heart
isn't even up to 150.

11:25.859 --> 11:26.816
Thank you, Nick.

11:26.860 --> 11:27.861
Anytime, Brooke.

11:28.905 --> 11:30.907
I'll be right back.

11:37.566 --> 11:39.742
Is this even legal,
what you're doing --

11:39.786 --> 11:41.091
experimenting on humans?

11:41.135 --> 11:43.137
Clinical trials.
Completely legal and contracted.

11:43.180 --> 11:45.792
This better be on the up-and-up,
not like what Dad did.

11:45.835 --> 11:47.141
This could be bad for us.

11:47.184 --> 11:49.360
You mean bad for you
and your political career?

11:51.014 --> 11:52.973
What's going on
with Project Utopia?

11:53.016 --> 11:55.802
Vanessa's looking into it.

11:55.845 --> 11:56.933
So far, nothing.

11:56.977 --> 11:59.501
Make sure it stays that way.

11:59.544 --> 12:02.809
Are we doing
the right thing here?

12:02.852 --> 12:03.940
There's still time
to stop it all.

12:03.984 --> 12:05.333
If Vanessa finds out
I'm involved --

12:05.376 --> 12:08.989
I know you care
about Vanessa.

12:09.032 --> 12:10.512
You spent all this time
getting close to her.

12:10.555 --> 12:12.209
It's only natural.

12:12.253 --> 12:14.864
But her family
destroyed ours.

12:16.736 --> 12:17.911
We lost everything.

12:17.954 --> 12:19.913
Don't forget that.

12:22.045 --> 12:23.699
It's our turn now.

12:29.792 --> 12:30.924
My mother moved
back to Stockport

12:30.967 --> 12:32.360
right before I was born.

12:32.403 --> 12:33.970
Did you work with her
at the hospital?

12:34.014 --> 12:37.060
I was doing my residency then,
and Pauline was kind to me.

12:37.104 --> 12:39.715
She spoke so highly of you.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.892
I was at the hospital earlier
and saw your name on a chart.

12:42.936 --> 12:44.372
Thought I'd look you up.

12:45.808 --> 12:47.810
I'm so sorry to hear
of her passing.

12:47.854 --> 12:51.161
At least she was spared
the sight of this war.

12:51.205 --> 12:53.207
She loved Paris.

12:53.250 --> 12:55.600
It would have destroyed her
to see it this way.

12:55.644 --> 12:57.994
Hmm.
Yes.

12:58.038 --> 13:00.083
And this is where she met
your father.

13:00.127 --> 13:02.085
She spoke about my father?

13:02.129 --> 13:03.695
A bit, yes.

13:03.739 --> 13:06.524
So you know he abandoned her
without a second thought.

13:07.961 --> 13:09.136
She gave up on Paris

13:09.179 --> 13:12.748
so my grandparents
could help her raise me.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.055
Now here I am,
defending it in war.

13:15.098 --> 13:20.538
Yes, the number of men killed
is...unfathomable.

13:20.582 --> 13:25.369
The past several months
have been...particularly bloody.

13:25.413 --> 13:29.765
But still, the mind
finds ways through it.

13:31.898 --> 13:34.509
It's a strange thing
to take a life, isn't it?

13:34.552 --> 13:38.121
My calling is to save lives,
not take them.

13:38.165 --> 13:42.560
Yes, but I imagine
the lines are often blurred.

13:42.604 --> 13:45.868
I can assure you they're not.

13:49.045 --> 13:51.439
Well, it's impressive

13:51.482 --> 13:55.747
to experience darkness
and not be consumed by it.

13:55.791 --> 13:58.359
Well, we don't have
much choice, do we?

13:58.402 --> 14:03.103
We either reject the darkness
or we let it destroy us.

14:06.976 --> 14:07.934
Another round?

14:07.977 --> 14:10.632
Please.

14:10.675 --> 14:12.373
Two more, please.Make it three.

14:12.416 --> 14:13.940
What do you say?

14:25.516 --> 14:26.474
I thought you'd show your face
sooner or later.

14:26.517 --> 14:28.171
So, Paris at war.

14:28.215 --> 14:29.564
Quite a sight, eh?

14:29.607 --> 14:31.740
It's an inconceivable tragedy.

14:31.783 --> 14:32.872
Oh, lighten up.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.395
Paris survives.

14:34.438 --> 14:35.918
The world marches on.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.180
We saw it ourselves.

14:37.224 --> 14:39.356
And we saw the scars
that were left behind.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.315
These conflicts happen
again and again.

14:41.358 --> 14:42.751
Each time, the killing
easier than before.

14:42.794 --> 14:44.927
You're so dramatic.

14:44.971 --> 14:47.712
War can never
be truly stopped.

14:47.756 --> 14:49.540
Once you unleash
a beast of this magnitude,

14:49.584 --> 14:52.674
there's no way
to call it off.

14:52.717 --> 14:55.329
Perhaps one day,
we shall annihilate each other.

14:55.372 --> 14:58.332
We'll call it
"The War of the Worlds."

15:00.203 --> 15:01.813
I see fatherhood
hasn't granted you

15:01.857 --> 15:03.511
a more benevolent view
of humanity.

15:03.554 --> 15:05.905
Hmm.

15:05.948 --> 15:07.471
Yes, Henry.

15:07.515 --> 15:10.431
I don't approve of the name,
but a decent lad, nonetheless.

15:10.474 --> 15:12.694
Who'd have thought?

15:12.737 --> 15:14.957
The conclusion is obvious.

15:15.001 --> 15:16.089
Leave him alone.

15:16.132 --> 15:17.090
Let him stay that way.

15:17.133 --> 15:18.134
I'm doing
a heroic thing here.

15:18.178 --> 15:19.396
His death is tragic,

15:19.440 --> 15:21.833
but the fact remains
you can't change history.

15:21.877 --> 15:23.226
Is that a guideline,

15:23.270 --> 15:24.227
or will the world fall apart
in front of our eyes?

15:24.271 --> 15:26.012
Quite possibly.

15:26.055 --> 15:27.317
So I'm supposed
to let my son die?

15:27.361 --> 15:28.884
Is that it?

15:28.928 --> 15:30.930
Unfortunately, yes.

15:30.973 --> 15:33.106
Because that is how
history records it.

15:33.149 --> 15:34.542
Doesn't
the Utopian philosophy

15:34.585 --> 15:36.936
require us to use our knowledge
to save his life?

15:36.979 --> 15:38.372
It's not our choice.

15:38.415 --> 15:40.156
Saving Henry could cost
countless others.

15:40.200 --> 15:43.159
Sounds like
a grand adventure to me.

15:43.203 --> 15:44.378
Is that why
you're doing this?

15:44.421 --> 15:45.509
Thrills?

15:45.553 --> 15:48.469
Do you even care
about Henry at all?

15:48.512 --> 15:51.211
Maybe that's what
I'm trying to discover.

15:52.081 --> 15:54.040
You're a complicated man,
John.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.476
I'll grant you that.

15:55.519 --> 15:58.653
And I am sorry about your son,
but you can't interfere.

15:58.696 --> 16:00.046
Another drink?

16:28.726 --> 16:29.945
Hey, there.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.251
How are you feeling?

16:31.294 --> 16:32.600
All bandaged up
and cleared for combat.

16:32.643 --> 16:33.775
Thanks.

16:33.818 --> 16:34.863
Have you seen Vanessa?

16:34.906 --> 16:36.604
Uh, she went
to go speak with some guy

16:36.647 --> 16:38.084
who used to work
for her father.

16:38.127 --> 16:41.739
About Project Utopia?

16:42.697 --> 16:44.655
She's on her cell
if you need her.

16:44.699 --> 16:47.136
No, i-it can wait.

16:47.180 --> 16:49.921
What's all this?

16:49.965 --> 16:51.880
There were photographers
and journalists

16:51.923 --> 16:53.795
all over Paris
during the war,

16:53.838 --> 16:56.580
and these are from an archive
at the national museum.

16:56.624 --> 16:57.712
Wow.
Incredible.

16:57.755 --> 16:59.670
How do you have access
to this stuff?

16:59.714 --> 17:01.846
My job gives me access.

17:01.890 --> 17:03.152
What is it you do?

17:03.196 --> 17:05.807
I'm an assistant curator
at the Space Museum,

17:05.850 --> 17:08.027
Or I am
until I get fired,

17:08.070 --> 17:11.247
which could be any day now
if I keep calling in sick.

17:11.291 --> 17:12.988
Ah.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.121
So, um,
what are you looking for?

17:15.164 --> 17:17.253
I requested all the images
for March 30th

17:17.297 --> 17:19.299
thinking maybe I could give us
some information

17:19.342 --> 17:20.778
that would help us in 1918,

17:20.822 --> 17:22.867
but all that is pointless,

17:22.911 --> 17:26.001
given that I'm here
and not in Paris.

17:26.045 --> 17:29.265
Yeah.

17:29.309 --> 17:33.182
Um, World War I
was a dangerous time.

17:33.226 --> 17:37.099
I wouldn't put a woman I cared
about in danger like that.

17:37.143 --> 17:40.189
Am I the only one here that's
living in the 21st century?

17:40.233 --> 17:44.063
No one wants to put
someone they love in danger.

17:44.106 --> 17:48.589
I wouldn't say H.G. loves me.

17:48.632 --> 17:50.330
Well, I've seen
you two together.

17:50.373 --> 17:53.420
If it's not love,
it's certainly getting there.

17:53.463 --> 17:56.162
Uh, but I do feel for you.

17:56.205 --> 17:58.120
Gonna be tough
when he finally

17:58.164 --> 18:00.296
takes his time machine
and heads home.

18:02.864 --> 18:04.474
Yeah.

18:06.259 --> 18:09.479
I guess it will be.

18:14.876 --> 18:17.052
It's time.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.010
I don't want you to go.

18:19.054 --> 18:21.100
I must.

18:21.143 --> 18:22.449
But I'll be back soon.

18:22.492 --> 18:24.320
Do you promise?

18:29.108 --> 18:31.849
Yeah, good lad!

18:31.893 --> 18:34.243
You'll never convince Henry
to dessert his comrades.

18:34.287 --> 18:37.594
Then I'll have to use
other means to stop him.

18:37.638 --> 18:39.988
Sorry to interrupt, gentlemen,

18:40.031 --> 18:41.468
but I'm afraid
I must take my leave.

18:41.511 --> 18:44.558
When this is all over,
I'll look you up in Stockport.

18:44.601 --> 18:46.299
We'll raise a glass
to my mother.

18:46.342 --> 18:47.952
I'd like that very much,
Henry.

18:47.996 --> 18:49.476
I'm sorry to see you go.

18:49.519 --> 18:51.173
Say a prayer for peace.

18:51.217 --> 18:55.830
Peace...
and long life.

19:03.490 --> 19:07.233
Well,
always a pleasure, H.G.

19:08.234 --> 19:09.757
Stay seated, John.

19:11.715 --> 19:14.762
I do believe this moment
feels familiar.

19:14.805 --> 19:17.286
Albeit reversed.

19:17.330 --> 19:20.246
Aren't you worried
people will see?

19:20.289 --> 19:21.421
I will shoot you in the leg
and carry you

19:21.464 --> 19:22.857
back to the time machine
if I have to.

19:22.900 --> 19:25.338
You have it all thought out,
don't you?

19:25.381 --> 19:27.731
I can't let you save
your son, John.

19:27.775 --> 19:30.865
And you can't stop me.

19:33.476 --> 19:35.348
John!

19:35.391 --> 19:36.479
Not in my cafÃ©!

19:36.523 --> 19:39.003
He's a bloody spy.
I heard him talking.

19:39.047 --> 19:41.267
He said the Germans
were up to something --No, no, you've got this wrong.

19:41.310 --> 19:42.398
I must stop this man.

19:42.442 --> 19:45.140
Drop the gun
before I kill you.

19:46.315 --> 19:47.969
I'll go get help.

19:50.537 --> 19:52.452
You have it wrong!

19:52.495 --> 19:54.541
One more word,
and you're dead.

20:03.158 --> 20:04.986
You must listen to me.You're not going anywhere.

20:05.029 --> 20:06.161
I would explain everything,
but Henry's transport
is leaving in moments.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.554
What does Henry
have to do with this?

20:07.597 --> 20:09.338
John has gone to pull him off
the Army transport.

20:09.382 --> 20:11.079
Why?
Is he in danger?

20:11.122 --> 20:12.994
There's no time to explain.
You have to take my word for it.

20:23.657 --> 20:26.747
Vanessa Anders
all grown up.

20:26.790 --> 20:28.923
My goodness.

20:28.966 --> 20:30.925
I remember when you would

20:30.968 --> 20:33.362
come visit your father
at the lab.

20:33.406 --> 20:36.104
I remember, too.

20:36.147 --> 20:38.237
I loved those visits.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.543
I think of your father often.

20:40.587 --> 20:43.677
Your parents' death
was such a tragedy.

20:43.720 --> 20:46.506
So much important work
left undone.

20:46.549 --> 20:48.508
Well, that work
is why I'm here, Dr. Meyers.

20:48.551 --> 20:49.683
I've recently come across

20:49.726 --> 20:51.467
a project my father
was working on --

20:51.511 --> 20:53.295
Utopia.

20:53.339 --> 20:54.470
Do you remember it?

20:54.514 --> 20:58.300
Oh, Utopia.
Um...

20:58.344 --> 21:00.563
No, not sure
that rings a bell.

21:00.607 --> 21:02.826
It was 1980.

21:02.870 --> 21:04.872
My father had just patented
his breakthrough.

21:04.915 --> 21:06.221
You were his right-hand man.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.136
You knew everything
going on in the lab.

21:08.179 --> 21:11.095
It was such a long time ago,
Vanessa.

21:11.139 --> 21:13.402
Sometimes,
the past should stay the past.

21:13.446 --> 21:16.057
Dr. Meyers, please.

21:16.100 --> 21:18.364
This is extremely important.

21:18.407 --> 21:21.323
What can you tell me?

21:21.367 --> 21:24.761
I-I just don't want you to be
disappointed in your father,

21:24.805 --> 21:25.980
to think less of him.

21:26.023 --> 21:27.373
Why would I think less
of him?

21:32.291 --> 21:33.770
David was
a brilliant scientist,

21:33.814 --> 21:35.990
but he was young,
impatient.

21:36.033 --> 21:37.774
Some of the medications
he patented --

21:37.818 --> 21:40.386
they saved the company
from financial ruin,

21:40.429 --> 21:45.042
but he didn't do
the original research.

21:45.086 --> 21:46.566
Did he steal the research?

21:46.609 --> 21:51.701
He never admitted it,
but I did suspect.

21:51.745 --> 21:55.705
There was no name on the files
other than "Utopia."

21:55.749 --> 21:58.360
And after your parents
were killed,

21:58.404 --> 22:00.667
the original hard copies
vanished.

22:00.710 --> 22:02.451
Well, there must
be something left.

22:02.495 --> 22:05.759
I still have
everything I brought

22:05.802 --> 22:09.719
from -- from the lab
when I retired.

22:09.763 --> 22:14.202
But  such a long
time ago, Vanessa.

22:14.245 --> 22:17.423
It's -- It's unlikely,
I'm afraid,

22:17.466 --> 22:19.555
that I have
anything that can help you,

22:19.599 --> 22:23.472
but, uh, I'll look.

22:25.518 --> 22:27.607
Thank you.
All right.

22:40.228 --> 22:42.491
Excuse me.

22:43.536 --> 22:45.320
Excuse me.
Henry Ayers?

22:45.364 --> 22:47.496
Henry Ayers.
That way? Thank you.

22:52.458 --> 22:54.634
I'll get right to it.

22:54.677 --> 22:57.419
Henry!
Henry.

22:57.463 --> 22:58.681
John.
You shouldn't be here.

22:58.725 --> 23:00.422
Listen to me.
It's vitally important we speak.

23:00.466 --> 23:01.771
I only need a moment.

23:01.815 --> 23:03.469
Pardon me, sir.
I don't think you understand.

23:03.512 --> 23:05.949
I'm deploying to war.

23:05.993 --> 23:07.734
One, sir.

23:11.607 --> 23:13.522
I have urgent news
from your father.

23:16.264 --> 23:18.571
That's impossible.

23:18.614 --> 23:20.529
My father doesn't even know
I was born.

23:20.573 --> 23:23.184
I swear on my life
he does.

23:23.227 --> 23:24.620
He sent me to find you.

23:24.664 --> 23:28.189
You worked with my mother.
How do you know my father?

23:28.232 --> 23:31.410
Just...come with me
for a moment.

23:31.453 --> 23:32.759
I'll tell you everything.

23:32.802 --> 23:34.456
-Allons-y!
-All right, men, let's move out!

23:41.898 --> 23:44.205
What's so important my father
couldn't say it to me himself?

23:44.248 --> 23:46.773
Your transport
is going to be ambushed.

23:46.816 --> 23:48.557
You and your men will
be dead before you even
make it to the front.

23:48.601 --> 23:49.689
You're mad.

23:49.732 --> 23:51.255
Where did you get
this information?

23:51.299 --> 23:52.822
I can't say,

23:52.866 --> 23:54.345
but your father sent me here
to help you.

23:54.389 --> 23:57.218
That is the most
unbelievable part of all.

23:57.261 --> 24:00.264
My father is a vile prat
who only cares for himself.

24:00.308 --> 24:01.527
Why would he help me?

24:04.617 --> 24:07.707
Because you're nothing
like him.

24:07.750 --> 24:09.317
I should hope not.

24:24.463 --> 24:25.986
Hey, you.

24:26.029 --> 24:27.596
Busy day?

24:27.640 --> 24:29.511
More like one of those days
where nothing is going right.

24:29.555 --> 24:30.643
Mm, how can I help?

24:30.686 --> 24:31.774
You could keep doing
what you're doing

24:31.818 --> 24:33.515
for a few more seconds.

24:33.559 --> 24:35.735
Oh, hold on.

24:35.778 --> 24:37.693
Things might be getting
a little better.

24:37.737 --> 24:39.782
Okay.

24:39.826 --> 24:41.305
Dr. Meyers.

24:41.349 --> 24:44.787
Vanessa, my late wife
always told me I was a hoarder,

24:44.831 --> 24:47.573
but sometimes,
it does come in handy.

24:47.616 --> 24:48.965
You found something.

24:49.009 --> 24:53.535
Some old files that I thought
had been shredded,

24:53.579 --> 24:55.929
but I haven't had a chance
to go through them yet.

24:55.972 --> 24:57.539
I'll be right there.

24:58.888 --> 25:01.238
Who is Dr. Meyers?Cedric Meyers, a scientist.

25:01.282 --> 25:03.153
I will explain everything
when I get back.All right.

25:03.197 --> 25:06.200
Just keep
your fingers crossed.Okay.

25:16.602 --> 25:17.820
Hey.

25:17.864 --> 25:21.128
Hey, so I have
something on Utopia.

25:21.171 --> 25:22.956
We need to find Cedric Meyers.

25:30.398 --> 25:32.487
Help! Someone!

25:33.923 --> 25:37.100
It's too late.

25:37.144 --> 25:38.537
They're all gone.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.277
I have to get back
to my men.

25:40.321 --> 25:43.019
You don't understand
what I mean by "gone."

25:43.063 --> 25:44.804
Why are you doing this?

25:44.847 --> 25:46.806
Clearly not
for the gratitude.

25:46.849 --> 25:49.939
You have kidnapped me
against my will.

25:49.983 --> 25:51.680
I saved you!

25:51.724 --> 25:53.639
Your father saved you!

25:53.682 --> 25:55.771
The man you judge,

25:55.815 --> 26:00.123
the man the whole world
has put on trial in absentia!

26:00.167 --> 26:03.474
The selfish, vile prat.
The Ripper!

26:03.518 --> 26:05.607
You know him so well,

26:05.651 --> 26:07.522
yet beg to know why.

26:07.566 --> 26:10.046
Why? Why?!

26:10.090 --> 26:15.182
He's lived a dark
and dishonorable life.

26:15.225 --> 26:17.576
He's done
despicable things.

26:22.842 --> 26:24.713
But that does not preclude

26:24.757 --> 26:26.628
the possibility of good,
does it, hmm?

26:29.022 --> 26:31.894
My boy.
My boy.

26:31.938 --> 26:35.332
Congratulations.

26:35.376 --> 26:38.509
You are the proof --

26:38.553 --> 26:41.991
the one good thing
he might ever do.

26:44.385 --> 26:50.043
The punctuation of a remarkable,
misunderstood life.

26:51.871 --> 26:53.524
You're a madman.

26:59.835 --> 27:01.924
I do -- I do believe
you're right.

27:01.968 --> 27:04.492
Untie me.

27:04.535 --> 27:05.754
At once.

27:24.730 --> 27:26.775
Are you with the 9th battalion?

27:26.819 --> 27:28.864
There's been an attack, sir.

27:28.908 --> 27:31.084
German artillery hit the convoy
on the outskirts of the city.

27:31.127 --> 27:32.781
There have been heavy losses.

27:35.741 --> 27:39.222
Sir, do you know, was everyone
present and accounted for?

27:44.445 --> 27:46.926
Yes.

27:46.969 --> 27:48.928
Yes.

27:48.971 --> 27:52.235
P-Please,
I-I need a moment.

27:54.020 --> 27:56.370
-Let's go and search the tents.
-Yes, sir.

27:56.413 --> 27:58.764
You son of a bitch.

27:58.807 --> 28:01.375
Most men respond favorably
when someone saves their life.

28:01.418 --> 28:03.725
I was supposed
to be on that truck.

28:03.769 --> 28:05.771
How did you know?

28:07.033 --> 28:10.166
Henry, there's so much
I want to tell you.

28:10.210 --> 28:11.907
We'll leave this place,
and I'll explain everything.

28:11.951 --> 28:13.909
I promise I will.

28:20.916 --> 28:22.918
Take this second chance,

28:22.962 --> 28:24.659
and go be with Margot.

28:29.751 --> 28:32.058
Stay away from us.

28:34.408 --> 28:37.367
Don't let me see
your face again.

28:41.458 --> 28:44.984
1918.
I have to go back now.

28:45.027 --> 28:46.072
This is Henry Ayers

28:46.115 --> 28:47.769
on the same day
he supposedly died

28:47.813 --> 28:49.815
when his convoy was attacked
outside the city.

28:49.858 --> 28:52.295
The records were wrong.
He was never on that truck.

28:52.339 --> 28:53.557
He died at a cafÃ©.

28:53.601 --> 28:55.777
H.G.'s looking for him
in the wrong place.

28:55.821 --> 28:58.649
We should be looking
at CafÃ© L'Automne.

29:05.874 --> 29:07.876
Here it is.
March 30, 1918.

29:07.920 --> 29:10.009
"An unidentified army medic,"
our Henry,

29:10.052 --> 29:11.271
"died trying to rescue people

29:11.314 --> 29:13.360
after the cafÃ© was hit
by the Paris Gun."

29:13.403 --> 29:15.710
There's no address.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.059
Poor guy.

29:17.103 --> 29:19.061
Avoided the ambush,
but ended up dead, anyway.

29:19.105 --> 29:21.150
Jane,
I-I don't think you sh--

29:25.807 --> 29:28.592
That photo.

29:28.636 --> 29:30.943
That guy in the background --
Can you enlarge it?

29:35.991 --> 29:37.863
Those clothes.

29:37.906 --> 29:39.952
It's H.G.

29:39.995 --> 29:42.737
Print -- Print the article.

29:45.261 --> 29:48.221
H.G. wanted you to stay here,
stay safe.

29:48.264 --> 29:50.310
He doesn't get to decide
what I can and can't do.

29:50.353 --> 29:51.833
But if you go back --

29:51.877 --> 29:53.704
Are you gonna send me back,
or are you gonna let him die?

29:55.663 --> 29:57.143
Okay.

29:57.186 --> 29:58.666
Okay.

29:58.709 --> 30:00.973
D-Do you even know
where to find Wells?

30:01.016 --> 30:02.496
Um, the truck just left,

30:02.539 --> 30:04.150
so I'll look for him
at the deployment yard.

30:04.193 --> 30:05.716
What if you don't
find him in time?

30:05.760 --> 30:08.937
We don't know when
that picture was taken.I'll find him.

30:25.911 --> 30:28.000
Vanessa?

30:28.043 --> 30:30.002
I'm sorry.
I thought you were someone else.

30:30.045 --> 30:32.352
Ohh.

30:34.397 --> 30:36.660
No!
No, please!

30:39.576 --> 30:41.796
No!

30:41.840 --> 30:43.929
No.
No, what are you doing?

31:18.702 --> 31:21.618
Dr. Meyers?

31:24.186 --> 31:26.885
It's Vanessa.

31:26.928 --> 31:28.712
Dr. Meyers?

31:30.540 --> 31:32.499
Hello?

31:32.542 --> 31:34.893
Dr. Meyers?

31:46.992 --> 31:47.993
Cedric?

31:52.388 --> 31:55.000
Dr. Meyers.

31:55.043 --> 31:56.088
Oh, God.

31:56.131 --> 31:56.915
Dr. Meyers.

31:58.177 --> 32:00.309
Dr. Meyers.

32:00.353 --> 32:02.398
Oh, God.

32:04.096 --> 32:05.662
911. What is your emergency?

32:05.706 --> 32:08.970
Hello.
I'm at 380 Oak Street.

32:09.014 --> 32:11.146
My friend -- I think he had
a heart attack.

32:11.190 --> 32:14.019
Stay on the line.Yes, I'll stay on the line.

32:14.062 --> 32:15.107
Okay, ma'am,
help is on the way.

32:21.809 --> 32:23.202
Hello?

32:24.725 --> 32:27.162
Someone there?

32:33.038 --> 32:34.996
Anybody here?

32:35.040 --> 32:38.652
Hello?

33:02.589 --> 33:05.244
Couldn't resist Paris in spring,
either, I see.

33:05.287 --> 33:06.462
Let go of me.

33:06.506 --> 33:08.073
Lost track of H.G.?

33:08.116 --> 33:09.639
Has he not given you
the bad news?

33:09.683 --> 33:11.424
What are you talking about?

33:11.467 --> 33:13.034
I won.

33:13.078 --> 33:14.557
The transport left
without him.

33:15.645 --> 33:18.474
I saved Henry's life.

33:18.518 --> 33:20.215
Congratulations.

33:20.259 --> 33:21.738
I hope that makes you
very happy.

33:23.436 --> 33:25.090
What's this you're holding?

33:25.133 --> 33:27.092
That has nothing
to do with you.

33:38.277 --> 33:39.756
What is this?

33:41.236 --> 33:43.499
Leave it alone, John.
Please.

33:45.893 --> 33:47.938
Henry dies at the cafÃ©.

33:50.158 --> 33:51.855
I didn't save him
after all.

33:53.988 --> 33:57.078
Wait.
Wait!

33:57.122 --> 33:59.167
There was an attack on our
convoy headed to Saint Quentin.

33:59.211 --> 34:01.126
What did you know about it?

34:01.169 --> 34:03.128
I-I knew nothing.
How could I?

34:03.171 --> 34:05.913
Do you know what
the punishment is for treason?

34:05.956 --> 34:07.175
Margot!

34:08.350 --> 34:09.264
Henry.

34:11.353 --> 34:13.660
You came back!

34:18.143 --> 34:21.276
John pulled me
off the transport.

34:21.320 --> 34:23.322
Everyone else is dead.

34:56.833 --> 34:59.053
No!

34:59.097 --> 35:00.141
Henry!

35:00.185 --> 35:02.578
Margot.

35:04.841 --> 35:07.888
H.G.!

35:07.931 --> 35:10.325
Oh, God.
Oh, God, H.G.

35:10.369 --> 35:11.631
Please be okay.

35:11.674 --> 35:14.024
I tried to stop it.

35:14.068 --> 35:15.330
Please.

35:17.593 --> 35:19.204
You need a doctor.

35:20.509 --> 35:22.163
Jane,
what are you doing here?

35:22.207 --> 35:23.382
I'm getting you
to the time machine.

35:23.425 --> 35:25.297
It's coming soon, okay?Okay.

35:25.340 --> 35:26.689
Come on.
We have to get you out of here.

35:26.733 --> 35:28.256
Henry.

35:28.300 --> 35:31.216
It's all right.
I'm here.

35:31.259 --> 35:34.480
She's going to be okay.

35:34.523 --> 35:36.960
How did you know?

35:45.012 --> 35:46.579
No, Henry, don't.

35:46.622 --> 35:48.015
There are still
people trapped inside.Henry!

35:48.058 --> 35:49.625
Henry.
Don't!

35:49.669 --> 35:51.061
Henry!

35:51.105 --> 35:53.238
-Help!
-Get away from there!

35:54.761 --> 35:56.197
This is how
Henry's supposed to die.

35:56.241 --> 35:58.373
-Henry!
-Henry!

36:00.593 --> 36:03.073
Henry!

36:07.687 --> 36:10.255
Henry!

36:10.298 --> 36:11.212
No!

36:11.256 --> 36:15.347
No!

36:17.871 --> 36:19.960
There was nothing
you could do.

36:21.527 --> 36:23.659
It was his day to die.

36:30.797 --> 36:31.885
H.G.!

36:31.928 --> 36:33.278
No!

36:33.321 --> 36:34.931
H.G., wake up!

36:34.975 --> 36:36.281
Can you help him?

36:40.110 --> 36:42.156
Can you help him?!
Please.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.985
Please.
Please.

36:49.598 --> 36:51.470
Not a good sign.

36:51.513 --> 36:53.385
Help him.
Why would I?

36:53.428 --> 36:54.647
Because you're more
than a murderer.

36:54.690 --> 36:55.996
You're a doctor.
You told me yourself.

36:56.039 --> 36:57.780
Now, prove it.

36:57.824 --> 36:59.434
Prove it.

37:04.396 --> 37:05.962
His eyes are dilated.

37:06.006 --> 37:07.529
Could have brain swelling
or internal bleeding.

37:07.573 --> 37:08.661
He needs a hospital.Help me get him
to the time machine.

37:08.704 --> 37:10.271
I'm not going back!

37:10.315 --> 37:12.273
Yes.
You have to.

37:12.317 --> 37:14.623
There's nothing left
for you here. Please.

37:17.191 --> 37:20.368
Please.

37:33.338 --> 37:35.122
Where's the time machine?

37:35.165 --> 37:37.255
This way.

37:51.878 --> 37:55.403
His blast injury resulted
in a mild hematoma,

37:55.447 --> 37:57.405
which obstructed
blood flow to his heart.

37:57.449 --> 37:59.451
He's on blood thinners
and meds for the pain.

37:59.494 --> 38:01.496
All he needs to do now
is rest.

38:04.064 --> 38:05.631
Thank you
for getting him home.

38:13.726 --> 38:16.032
Vanessa Anders, I assume.

38:16.076 --> 38:18.296
We finally meet.

38:20.559 --> 38:21.560
Where are you putting him?

38:21.603 --> 38:22.909
The basement for now.

38:22.952 --> 38:25.520
I saved Wells.

38:25.564 --> 38:27.348
Isn't that worth anything?

38:27.392 --> 38:28.871
Doesn't erase
what you've done...

38:28.915 --> 38:30.960
or who you are.

38:31.004 --> 38:34.094
I suppose not.

38:34.137 --> 38:36.314
Well,
it was nice to meet you.

38:36.357 --> 38:38.228
I do hope to see you again.

38:48.064 --> 38:49.979
Jane?

38:50.023 --> 38:51.329
Where are we?

38:51.372 --> 38:53.243
2017.

38:53.287 --> 38:54.332
We did it.

38:54.375 --> 38:56.464
And what of John?

38:56.508 --> 38:58.684
Vanessa has him locked up.

38:58.727 --> 39:00.468
And his son, Henry?

39:01.513 --> 39:02.775
He died.

39:02.818 --> 39:05.560
John didn't change
anything.

39:05.604 --> 39:08.433
He did help
bring you back.

39:08.476 --> 39:10.260
He's locked up?

39:10.304 --> 39:12.393
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

39:12.437 --> 39:13.786
Easy.

39:13.829 --> 39:15.744
We had to insert
this tube in your arm.

39:18.268 --> 39:21.837
Oh, this is a very impressive
anesthetic.

39:21.881 --> 39:23.752
I feel very lightheaded.

39:23.796 --> 39:26.364
Ooh.
And good.

39:29.105 --> 39:31.543
Jane, I'm so sorry.

39:31.586 --> 39:33.545
It's okay.

39:33.588 --> 39:34.720
No, it's not.

39:34.763 --> 39:37.287
I-I didn't wish
to be an oinking pig.

39:39.202 --> 39:41.553
A sexistoinking pig.

39:41.596 --> 39:43.642
I'm sorry if my behavior
offends you.

39:43.685 --> 39:46.384
No.
I'm sorry for being too pushy.

39:46.427 --> 39:48.647
It's just I've grown
very fond of you,

39:48.690 --> 39:52.477
and the idea that you could
be hurt is unbearable.

39:53.478 --> 39:56.524
That's exactly why
I had to go back.

39:56.568 --> 39:58.613
I had to help you.

40:00.659 --> 40:04.140
I do believe
fate has brought us together.

40:05.968 --> 40:08.493
You're hurt.
You need to rest.

40:08.536 --> 40:10.146
No, hurt is what I'll be

40:10.190 --> 40:12.584
when I'm forced
to say goodbye to you.

40:12.627 --> 40:16.675
You're not going anywhere
right now but to sleep.

40:16.718 --> 40:21.723
But one day,
I will go home,

40:21.767 --> 40:23.943
and I'll be forced to live
a life without you in it.

40:25.771 --> 40:29.775
I can't imagine
a day without you in it.

40:42.570 --> 40:45.486
Wells is back,
and he brought John with him.

40:45.530 --> 40:48.141
Vanessa has him
locked up tight.

40:49.882 --> 40:50.970
Wells, John,

40:51.013 --> 40:53.625
and the time machine
all in one place.

40:53.668 --> 40:54.843
Makes things easier.

40:57.672 --> 40:59.544
You killed Cedric Meyers.

41:01.589 --> 41:02.851
He had a heart attack.

41:02.895 --> 41:06.115
Don't lie to me, Brooke,
not now, not about this.

41:07.682 --> 41:09.031
I did what I had to do
to keep your girlfriend

41:09.075 --> 41:10.380
from finding out
what you're up to.

41:10.424 --> 41:12.557
Well, it didn't work.

41:12.600 --> 41:14.428
Vanessa has Meyers' computer.

41:16.082 --> 41:18.519
Then you better hope
she doesn't find anything,

41:18.563 --> 41:20.521
or we're both screwed.
