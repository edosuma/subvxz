WEBVTT

00:13.555 --> 00:15.181
Ah, <i>Mademoiselle</i> Cooper.

00:15.265 --> 00:16.266
Package.

00:16.933 --> 00:19.185
Oh! <i>Merci!</i>

00:24.482 --> 00:26.026
Is it for me?

00:26.109 --> 00:28.403
-No. Do people think you live here?
-Mmm-mmm.

00:29.237 --> 00:32.115
Uh-oh, "Skokie, Illinois, USA."

00:32.741 --> 00:34.743
Oh, is it from Ma and Pa Cooper?

00:36.119 --> 00:39.205
Oh, my God. If it's your birthday,
I'm going to be so mad.

00:39.289 --> 00:42.292
It's tomorrow. It's a nothing year
so I don't feel like celebrating.

00:42.375 --> 00:45.670
I'm sorry, your friends decide
if there's gonna be a celebration.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.047
That's how birthdays work.

00:47.130 --> 00:49.674
Fine, but no surprises.
I've had enough of those.

00:49.758 --> 00:52.260
Wait, how about we throw a dinner party?

00:52.343 --> 00:54.179
-Can you cook?
-Not at all. Can you?

00:54.262 --> 00:55.680
I can make a couple of things.

00:55.764 --> 00:59.768
Oh, my God, we're having
our first Parisian dinner party!

01:02.437 --> 01:04.773
I can see it.
We can put the table right here,

01:04.856 --> 01:07.484
and then we can have little lights
floating in the fountain!

01:07.567 --> 01:09.569
We can hang some
of the crap your parents sent.

01:09.652 --> 01:11.362
Do we need a permit?

01:11.446 --> 01:12.947
If we ask, we will.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.365
-Uh-oh.

01:14.449 --> 01:16.326
Chef on your left. Chef on your left!

01:17.535 --> 01:18.495
<i>Bonjour.</i>

01:18.578 --> 01:19.412
Hi!

01:19.996 --> 01:22.290
-What is going on here?
-Oh, just hanging out.

01:23.333 --> 01:24.542
Like we do.

01:25.502 --> 01:29.339
Actually, it's my birthday tomorrow,
and we're planning a little dinner party.

01:29.422 --> 01:30.465
You have to be there.

01:30.548 --> 01:33.468
Perfect. I will bake you a cake.
That will be my gift.

01:33.551 --> 01:35.720
That would be really nice.
Thank you so much.

01:40.308 --> 01:43.478
Okay, so now that that's settled,
I'm going back to bed.

01:43.561 --> 01:46.272
So you can… Toodles, poodles.

01:48.691 --> 01:51.361
-So I have a question.
-Okay.

01:51.444 --> 01:54.614
How did your romantic weekend
in St Tropez with Mathieu Cadault

01:54.697 --> 01:56.950
turn into a holiday with Camille?

01:57.450 --> 01:59.619
She was upset and wanted to get away.

01:59.702 --> 02:02.038
And I'm glad she came. It was really fun.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.874
You're avoiding the question.
Why wasn't Mathieu there?

02:04.958 --> 02:06.584
Because he overheard our conversation

02:06.668 --> 02:09.921
and didn't wanna go on vacation with me
anymore, which was the right move.

02:10.004 --> 02:13.258
-Because you don't have feelings for him.
-Because Mathieu was a client.

02:13.341 --> 02:15.718
I shouldn't have been going
to St Tropez with him.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.555
And I'm all about
doing the right thing now.

02:18.638 --> 02:20.098
With clients and with neighbors.

02:21.474 --> 02:23.226
So bye.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.187


02:26.271 --> 02:27.438


02:43.663 --> 02:45.582
Of course I will come
to your dinner party.

02:45.665 --> 02:48.293
Oh, great. Oh, that makes me so happy.

02:48.376 --> 02:51.296
I know exactly what
I'm gonna get you for your birthday.

02:51.379 --> 02:53.590
I am going
to the hammam with friends today,

02:53.673 --> 02:54.841
<i>and I want you to join me.</i>

02:54.924 --> 02:57.010
Um, a ha-what?

02:57.093 --> 03:00.346
You will see. You're gonna love it.
Okay, I will text you the address.

03:00.430 --> 03:01.598
-Okay, bye.
-<i>Bye.</i>

03:02.765 --> 03:05.143
<i>Bonjour,</i> Sylvie!
When did you get back to Paris?

03:05.226 --> 03:06.144
This morning.

03:06.227 --> 03:08.271
Did you have
a good time with your husband?

03:08.354 --> 03:09.731
I mean, Laurent G.

03:10.940 --> 03:12.942
We've been married
a very long time,

03:13.026 --> 03:15.278
we don't live together,
we don't have any children.

03:15.361 --> 03:16.779
Now you know everything.

03:17.488 --> 03:19.782
Well, in America we wear wedding rings!

03:20.533 --> 03:21.743


03:23.036 --> 03:26.164
I have one more piece
of business before we wrap up.

03:26.247 --> 03:28.499
First, Rimowa loves the Cadault collab.

03:28.583 --> 03:32.295
So I'm hoping
that their enthusiasm will sway Pierre.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.088
Second, it's my birthday tomorrow

03:34.172 --> 03:37.759
and I wanted to invite you all
to a dinner party at my place.

03:37.842 --> 03:40.053
Ah, excellent! I'll be there.

03:41.137 --> 03:43.556
-Yes, I can come.
-Yay.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.768
Well, <i>merci beaucoup,</i> Emily,
for the invitation,

03:46.851 --> 03:51.648
but first, Pierre is not at all swayable
to the idea of working with Rimowa.

03:52.315 --> 03:55.151
He was on the verge of not wanting
to work with Savoir anymore.

03:55.235 --> 03:59.948
Luckily, Julien massaged his nerves,
and he saved us from losing a client.

04:00.031 --> 04:03.701
But there was no actual massage involved,
I just want to be clear.

04:03.785 --> 04:07.372
And now Julien
will be running point on the account.

04:08.581 --> 04:11.584
-I think I hear my phone…
-Julien, can we talk?

04:15.129 --> 04:16.547
You stole Pierre from me!

04:16.631 --> 04:18.925
If anyone should be
accused of stealing, it's you.

04:19.008 --> 04:21.302
You went over my head with Rimowa.
My account.

04:21.386 --> 04:24.055
You were looking
for an opportunity to get back at me?

04:24.138 --> 04:27.809
I'm sorry for what happened with Pierre,
but it happened because of your actions.

04:27.892 --> 04:30.770
-I was trying to defend you!
-Next time, try not to defend me.

04:30.853 --> 04:31.688
No problems.

04:31.771 --> 04:34.023
Everything is okay. Whoa-oh!

04:34.107 --> 04:35.817
No one stole anyone.

04:36.484 --> 04:39.862
We all work together.
There is no need to be mad.

04:39.946 --> 04:42.407
-I'm not mad! I'm disappointed.
-Me too!

04:42.490 --> 04:45.118
I was looking forward to your party.
You're disinviting me.

04:45.201 --> 04:47.203
-No, I'm not!
-Great, I'll be there!

04:47.287 --> 04:49.706
Good! Let me know
if you have any food allergies!

04:51.291 --> 04:52.125
<i>Voilà.</i>

05:00.675 --> 05:03.177
This is really beautiful.

05:03.261 --> 05:04.679
I know.

05:04.762 --> 05:08.516
There are so many cool Moroccan places
to visit in this city.

05:08.599 --> 05:12.312
I just love it.
The restaurants, the tea houses.

05:13.271 --> 05:14.314
-Hello.
-Hello.

05:14.397 --> 05:17.150
We booked a steam and a scrub for two.

05:18.484 --> 05:20.486
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i> Towel?

05:20.570 --> 05:23.698
<i>-Oui. Merci.</i> Thank you.
<i>-Merci.</i>

05:27.035 --> 05:27.994
Um…

05:29.037 --> 05:31.831
Can I… Can I have a robe too?
<i>S'il vous plaît.</i>

05:34.167 --> 05:35.168
Thank you.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.259
Maybe they should find us.

05:43.343 --> 05:47.430
It seems a little awkward
to be scanning the room, you know?

05:48.097 --> 05:51.517
So am I supposed to
still kiss their cheeks when we meet?

05:51.601 --> 05:53.394
What? That's all you're going to kiss?

05:53.478 --> 05:56.189
I… Sorry,
I don't know the protocol.

05:56.272 --> 05:58.649
I've never met someone
for the first time naked.

05:59.317 --> 06:00.485
Except for maybe my mom.

06:00.568 --> 06:02.362
-You're funny.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.115
-Camille.
-Hey!

06:06.199 --> 06:07.492
-How are you?
-Good, you?

06:07.575 --> 06:09.410
-Good, you?
-Good to see you.

06:09.911 --> 06:12.121
<i>-Bonjour. Ça va?</i>
-Hi.

06:15.833 --> 06:17.710
You brought her
to your parents'?

06:17.794 --> 06:19.212
-In English?
-Sorry.

06:19.295 --> 06:22.590
I was just asking
if you are the brother fucker.

06:23.716 --> 06:25.259
Yep, that's me.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.053
Well, I don't blame you.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.639
Emily's one of the good ones.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.517
I see. Well, nice to meet you.

06:34.977 --> 06:36.270
Okay.

06:37.313 --> 06:41.317
So, Emily, do you prefer American men
or French men?

06:41.401 --> 06:44.195
Apparently, I prefer young men.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.740
Well, I prefer American men.

06:47.824 --> 06:51.452
I mean, they're so big and hairy.
And they seem very easy too.

06:52.495 --> 06:55.123
Well, French men are not easy.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.583
What's going on with Gabriel?

06:57.667 --> 06:59.752
Wait, I bet that I know.

06:59.836 --> 07:02.922
Camille is waiting for Gabriel
to do this grand gesture,

07:03.005 --> 07:06.467
and Gabriel is waiting for Camille
to apologize for their fight.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.636
Camille, are you being stubborn?

07:08.719 --> 07:10.179
He is being stubborn.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.889
You two have broken up before, right?

07:11.973 --> 07:15.977
Yeah, I mean, a couple of times,
and we also fight, like every couple.

07:16.686 --> 07:19.605
But I don't know,
like, this time it feels different.

07:20.773 --> 07:23.818
-Do you think there's someone else?
-No.

07:24.527 --> 07:27.947
No, I don't know. Definitely not. Mmm-mmm.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.201
They weren't kidding, huh?
The heat in here.

07:34.495 --> 07:38.207
I mean, the only "someone else"
is his restaurant.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.043
-His pots and pans mean the world to him.

07:41.127 --> 07:44.255
Actually, more than people.
And I learned that a long time ago.

07:44.338 --> 07:49.510
That's right. Doesn't he have
a special pan that no one can touch?

07:49.594 --> 07:51.262
Yeah. His omelette pan.

07:51.345 --> 07:54.724
And even has his initials on it. GTC.

07:54.807 --> 07:58.144
Of course you know you can't get between
a man and his pan, Camille.

07:58.227 --> 07:59.228
What do you mean?

07:59.312 --> 08:01.355
He probably spoons his spoons.

08:01.439 --> 08:02.565
Oh, definitely!

08:04.609 --> 08:07.778
Okay, Emily,
don't ever date a French chef.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.363
Not on the plan.

08:12.241 --> 08:14.035
So did you have fun?

08:14.118 --> 08:17.038
-I think my friends really liked you.
-They were great.

08:17.121 --> 08:19.457
And I wanted to let you know
that I invited Gabriel

08:19.540 --> 08:21.292
to the dinner party tomorrow night.

08:21.375 --> 08:22.710
Emily, why?

08:22.793 --> 08:24.337
Now I'm not sure if I'm coming.

08:24.420 --> 08:27.965
No, you have to. It'll be
a great chance for the two of you to talk.

08:28.049 --> 08:30.092
No one has to be
the first one to reach out.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.845
You both can just show up. No drama.

08:33.471 --> 08:35.139
Don't be stubborn.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.644
Oh, my God, is that Mathieu Cadault?

08:41.145 --> 08:44.315
Ugh, yes. Ugh, he's like the last person
I want to see right now.

08:44.398 --> 08:47.360
You know I was kicked off Pierre's account
after the St Tropez trip?

08:47.443 --> 08:49.362
Are you kidding? That's awful.

08:49.445 --> 08:51.113
I know, believe me. Lesson learned.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.533
I am never mixing dating
and work ever again.

08:54.617 --> 08:57.495
-Anyway, thank you so much for the hammam.
-You're so welcome.

08:58.621 --> 08:59.872
And I'll see you tomorrow?

08:59.956 --> 09:01.916
-Of course!
-Okay.

09:12.260 --> 09:15.221
Did someone pull
a Mathieu-Cadault on Mathieu Cadault?

09:15.304 --> 09:16.138
Excuse me?

09:16.222 --> 09:18.599
Stand you up, like you stood up Emily?

09:19.225 --> 09:20.268
That's not what happened.

09:20.351 --> 09:22.687
You dumped her then fired her
from Pierre's account.

09:22.770 --> 09:24.105
What are you talking about?

09:24.188 --> 09:26.566
You didn't have Emily
taken off Pierre's account?

09:27.441 --> 09:30.403
I didn't. She bungled that on her own.

09:31.112 --> 09:32.822
And I also didn't stand her up.

09:32.905 --> 09:35.950
We were about to leave, and I found out
Emily was having an affair.

09:36.450 --> 09:38.953
I don't want to get involved.
It's none of my business.

09:41.163 --> 09:42.248
If you'll excuse me.

09:42.873 --> 09:43.791
<i>Allô?</i>

10:16.991 --> 10:18.075
Oh, great.

10:18.159 --> 10:21.621
I still have to tell Rimowa
that the idea they love isn't happening.

10:22.204 --> 10:23.372
They do look good.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.333
No, I'm not dealing with this today.

10:25.416 --> 10:27.376
That is my birthday present to myself.

10:27.460 --> 10:31.047
Oh, this is also for you.

10:34.967 --> 10:39.138
It's my Chicago deep-dish pizza
from Madeline!

10:39.221 --> 10:40.765
Uh, yum.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.770
Did someone get sick?

10:48.230 --> 10:51.233
You know there's
a no-food policy in the office.

10:51.942 --> 10:56.614
It says this can stay good
for up to six month in the freezer.

10:57.365 --> 10:58.658
How horrible.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.576
Okay, I'll take this.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.037
Put it in the kitchen. Save it for later.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.915
I hope
you're throwing that away.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.124
Of course I am.

11:12.588 --> 11:13.756
Emily?

11:13.839 --> 11:17.176
May I take you somewhere special
for lunch for your birthday?

11:18.094 --> 11:21.097
That would be so nice, Luc. Thank you.

11:25.559 --> 11:27.019
This is where we're having lunch?

11:27.103 --> 11:30.439
<i>Oui.</i> Père Lachaise.
My favorite cemetery.

11:30.981 --> 11:31.982
Look!

11:36.529 --> 11:37.530
It's Balzac.

11:39.365 --> 11:43.244
I like to sit by Balzac
because no one sits by Balzac.

11:43.327 --> 11:48.999
They're too busy at Chopin,
or Gertrude Stein, or Oscar Wilde.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.544
Plus, I like his big head.

11:52.586 --> 11:54.714
Ah, so you come here often?

11:54.797 --> 11:56.340
Always on my birthday.

11:57.133 --> 12:01.262
For me, to think about life
is to contemplate death.

12:01.345 --> 12:04.306
-Huh.
-We think our real life is up here.

12:04.390 --> 12:07.727
But, really, we will spend
most of eternity down there.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.603
Oh, so you believe in an afterlife?

12:09.687 --> 12:11.981
Ah, an afterlife!

12:13.357 --> 12:16.152
No, Emily. Afterlife is nothing.

12:16.235 --> 12:19.697
Oblivion. A darkness we cannot imagine.

12:20.364 --> 12:21.323
Hmm.

12:21.407 --> 12:26.162
So! Every birthday I like to enjoy
every minute of life while I am here.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.748
Don't waste time with guilt,

12:28.831 --> 12:35.296
or thinking about Marianne number one,
or Marianne number two.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.382
Who are all the Mariannes?

12:38.466 --> 12:42.762
Doesn't matter.
I don't think about them.

12:43.846 --> 12:49.143
Just never date a woman named Marianne.

12:50.519 --> 12:51.520
Okay.

12:52.271 --> 12:53.522
Never.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.116
<i>-Bonjour.</i>
-Oh! <i>Bonjour.</i>

13:04.200 --> 13:05.826
-Is that for tonight?
-Yep.

13:05.910 --> 13:06.952
May I?

13:10.498 --> 13:12.708
Oh, you are going to serve this?

13:13.584 --> 13:14.543
To people?

13:15.127 --> 13:16.170
I thought I was.

13:16.253 --> 13:18.547
Okay, we have to get to the market.

13:19.715 --> 13:22.468
-Excuse me, what? Now?
-Yes, we still have time.

13:38.192 --> 13:42.029
Now you have excellent ingredients.
All you have to do is not get in the way.

13:43.447 --> 13:46.200
Okay. I'm going to try
not to think about that too much.

13:47.868 --> 13:49.912
Ah, it's probably
just a little bit of rain.

13:55.376 --> 13:56.877
That came out of nowhere!

13:56.961 --> 13:58.003
I know.

13:59.839 --> 14:00.798
Oh…

14:01.674 --> 14:03.092
<i>Coup de foudre.</i>

14:03.175 --> 14:06.679
That literally means "lightning strike."
Or thunder clap.

14:06.762 --> 14:08.722
<i>-Coup de foudre.</i>

14:09.515 --> 14:12.309
It's like a… summer storm!

14:13.352 --> 14:15.646
We get those in the Midwest all the time.

14:16.647 --> 14:18.524
-It also means…

14:19.316 --> 14:20.484
…love at first sight.

14:30.995 --> 14:31.996
Um…

14:32.746 --> 14:35.958
I… I'm gonna… go home.

14:36.041 --> 14:39.378
And, um, not get in the way of the food.

14:40.671 --> 14:41.964
Wa…

15:02.151 --> 15:03.819
<i>Bonjour,</i> Pierre.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.195
<i>Bonjour,</i> Sylvie.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.698
Why are those here?

15:07.781 --> 15:09.158
I feel attacked!

15:09.241 --> 15:12.745
I'm here to keep you from making
the worst mistake of your career.

15:13.412 --> 15:17.374
This luggage is the natural
next step of the Ringarde line.

15:17.458 --> 15:20.419
And I happen to think it's exquisite.

15:21.587 --> 15:26.091
I don't want to be Mickey Mouse
and have my face all over everything.

15:26.842 --> 15:28.677
I hate that image.

15:28.761 --> 15:32.765
Why? When I see that image
I see a happy, successful man.

15:32.848 --> 15:35.392
-The head of a cutting-edge brand.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.937
I see the head of an old hag.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.438
A hag on a bag!

15:39.521 --> 15:41.482
That's what people will say.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.985
Would you approve an image
of yourself when you were younger?

15:45.819 --> 15:49.365
Well, I did look pretty good

15:50.032 --> 15:52.910
back when my body
was making its own hair and collagen.

15:56.330 --> 15:59.166
So you don't like this image
because you think you look old.

15:59.917 --> 16:04.380
But what are you saying to me?
To the women who buy Pierre Cadault?

16:05.214 --> 16:07.675
That we're not beautiful if we age?

16:09.176 --> 16:13.263
Women look to you
to make them feel good about themselves.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.392
Don't underestimate
the power you have to do that.

16:24.566 --> 16:27.987
I NEED TO SEE YOU IMMEDIATELY.

16:41.709 --> 16:44.753
Oh, my God!
This looks so good!

16:44.837 --> 16:47.881
I know! We have
to send Bill and Jean a photo.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.300
What? You're on a first-name basis
with my parents now?

16:50.384 --> 16:53.303
We discussed it in the text thread.
You just never respond.

16:53.387 --> 16:55.597
-Good evening, girls!
<i>-Bonsoir!</i>

16:56.557 --> 16:57.558
Hi.

16:58.475 --> 17:00.310
So I brought you the good stuff.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.604
The Grand Cru of
Domaine de Lalisse champagne.

17:02.688 --> 17:04.148
<i>Bonne anniversaire, ma chérie.</i>

17:04.231 --> 17:05.733
You are too much!

17:05.816 --> 17:08.777
Um, I climbed a tree
and hung over 20 feet of fairy lights?

17:08.861 --> 17:10.904
Okay, you both have done too much then.

17:10.988 --> 17:12.364
But I feel very, very lucky.

17:12.448 --> 17:15.200
You are. Okay, I'm gonna
take this upstairs and let it chill.

17:15.284 --> 17:16.118
Sure.

17:16.785 --> 17:19.038
So who's coming to this dinner?

17:19.121 --> 17:22.249
It's you, me, Mindy,
Gabriel, which you know,

17:22.332 --> 17:24.209
and some people from the office.

17:24.293 --> 17:26.420
No mystery man that you may be dating…

17:26.503 --> 17:28.088
Mystery man? No!

17:28.172 --> 17:29.548
-<i>Bonsoir.</i>

17:29.631 --> 17:30.674
Hi.

17:30.758 --> 17:33.093
-I brought you these.
-Thank you.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.012
-Hi.
-Hello.

17:36.013 --> 17:38.182
You look beautiful, Camille.

17:38.265 --> 17:39.349
Thank you.

17:39.433 --> 17:40.350
Excuse me.

17:43.604 --> 17:46.315
Happy birthday party!

17:46.398 --> 17:50.444
It's <i>La Cousine Bette.</i>
One of my favorite Balzac novels.

17:50.527 --> 17:53.405
It's about an unmarried middle-aged woman

17:53.489 --> 17:56.867
who plots the destruction
of her extended family.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.995
Why'd you look at me when you said that?

18:00.621 --> 18:04.458
Anyway,
um, Pierre is doing the luggage.

18:04.541 --> 18:07.169
Oh, my God,
did Julien convince him?

18:07.252 --> 18:08.837
-No, I did.
-Yay!

18:08.921 --> 18:11.799
No hugs necessary.
I did it for the company.

18:11.882 --> 18:16.053
But, um, I did bring you
a little present for your birthday.

18:16.136 --> 18:16.970
Hmm.

18:17.971 --> 18:18.931
Open it!

18:20.474 --> 18:21.391
Ooh!

18:22.017 --> 18:24.019
Wow, a cigarette case.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.563
Um, but you know that I don't smoke.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.524
Well, it's never too late to start.

18:32.444 --> 18:35.697
You know, this is the longest
we've been apart since we met.

18:35.781 --> 18:38.575
Except for the first Christmas
when you went skiing in Chamonix.

18:38.659 --> 18:41.995
That's right. There was no cell reception
so you couldn't reach me.

18:42.079 --> 18:44.790
It made me crazy.
After two days I drove all night.

18:44.873 --> 18:47.042
-I had to see you.

18:48.085 --> 18:53.257
I'm sorry for losing my temper.
And I'm sorry if I pushed you away.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.050
Camille…

18:56.385 --> 19:01.306
I'm sorry too. You're not to blame.
We both have things to work on.

19:01.390 --> 19:05.018
I know. But what matters
most to me is the two of us.

19:05.102 --> 19:07.104
I don't want to throw away what we have.

19:09.022 --> 19:11.316
-You okay?
-Yes.

19:12.109 --> 19:14.444
It's exactly
what I wanted for my birthday.

19:15.237 --> 19:18.615
The two of them together.
It's… it's how it should be.

19:19.491 --> 19:20.534
Yeah.

19:29.168 --> 19:32.045
Pierre! I'm so sorry!
How did those get here?

19:32.129 --> 19:34.923
Why are you sorry? I love them!

19:35.591 --> 19:38.302
You do? Me too! Love!

19:39.344 --> 19:41.180
But I think
the hardware looks a little cheap,

19:41.263 --> 19:42.848
and so do the wheels.

19:42.931 --> 19:45.392
I totally agree.
I'm on my way to a dinner party,

19:45.475 --> 19:49.021
but I will discuss the hardware
and the wheels with Rimowa tomorrow.

19:49.104 --> 19:50.314
Ah, no.

19:50.397 --> 19:52.357
This is an important matter.

19:52.441 --> 19:54.651
I think we should figure it out now.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.487
Okay.

19:57.571 --> 19:59.740
And the image. You like it?

19:59.823 --> 20:01.325
Love.

20:03.285 --> 20:05.204
I need to see the luggage on the move.

20:05.954 --> 20:07.372
Pretend you're at the airport.

20:09.708 --> 20:10.542
Mmm?

20:17.925 --> 20:18.884
Faster.

20:21.011 --> 20:22.721
A little bit faster.

20:25.140 --> 20:27.017
Hurry! Your plane is leaving!

20:37.319 --> 20:38.904
<i>-Santé!</i>
<i>-Santé!</i>

20:38.987 --> 20:42.032
I think our first
Parisian dinner party was a success.

20:42.115 --> 20:43.116
Oh, I do too.

20:43.200 --> 20:46.036
Either my taste buds
are impaired from heavy drinking

20:46.119 --> 20:47.788
or the food was actually good!

20:47.871 --> 20:49.498
-It was really good.
-Thanks.

20:49.581 --> 20:51.041
I think it was delicious.

20:51.124 --> 20:54.795
And I appreciate how generous
you were with the butter.

20:55.379 --> 20:58.423
Well, I think butter
is where Chicago and Paris meet.

20:58.507 --> 21:01.885
-Oh, no, I'll get it. I'll get it.

21:01.969 --> 21:03.428
Are you having a good time?

21:03.512 --> 21:05.764
Oh, yeah, it's a perfect night. Thank you.

21:07.182 --> 21:08.892
It's nice to see you two together.

21:09.434 --> 21:12.437
Well, I would be happy
if you were seeing someone, too.

21:13.230 --> 21:14.106
I know.

21:14.189 --> 21:17.526
If you want to keep your little affair
secret, that's fine too.

21:38.547 --> 21:41.133
The cake looks spectacular, Gabriel!

21:41.216 --> 21:42.301
Oh, shit! The champagne.

21:44.511 --> 21:46.013
Make a wish! Make a wish!

22:21.214 --> 22:23.091
Yo, Gab. Gabs, tell me what I'm eating,

22:23.175 --> 22:25.844
so that I can properly
post about it on my social.

22:25.927 --> 22:29.306
It's chocolate cake filled with
three layers of Belgian chocolate mousse

22:29.389 --> 22:31.558
and sprinkled with some sea salt
from Île de Ré.

22:31.641 --> 22:33.310
It's absolutely sublime.

22:33.935 --> 22:37.689
Yeah, I pretty much think this is the best
chocolate cake I've ever had. Seriously.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.399
Good, I made it for you.

22:40.150 --> 22:41.318
Oh, sorry.

22:46.406 --> 22:48.533
Ah, the champagne has arrived!

22:48.617 --> 22:50.994
Ah! Okay, <i>meuf,</i> make a toast!

22:51.078 --> 22:52.245
-Yeah!
-Come on!

22:52.329 --> 22:53.872
-Come on!
-Up!

22:53.955 --> 22:55.582
Okay, okay.

22:56.249 --> 22:57.417
Um…

22:57.501 --> 22:58.502
All right.

22:58.585 --> 23:01.546
Okay, where do I begin? Uh…

23:02.255 --> 23:05.926
Well, you all have made
my time here so special.

23:06.635 --> 23:08.387
I know that I'm still getting my footing

23:08.470 --> 23:10.806
and making a bunch of mistakes
along the way,

23:10.889 --> 23:13.016
so <i>pardon!</i> Um…

23:14.267 --> 23:18.772
Um, but truly,
thank you, guys, for putting up with me.

23:18.855 --> 23:19.898
Aw!

23:19.981 --> 23:21.400
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

23:21.483 --> 23:22.901
<i>-Santé.</i>
-<i>Santé.</i>

23:23.735 --> 23:26.613
Um, I would like to make a toast too.

23:26.696 --> 23:28.323
Oh! Aw!

23:28.407 --> 23:30.867
To Emily, our hostess,

23:30.951 --> 23:34.496
who certainly has made
her share of mistakes in Paris.

23:35.205 --> 23:39.084
She pretended to be my friend
while she had an affair with my boyfriend.

23:39.793 --> 23:43.547
And, to my boyfriend,
who fucked my fake friend!

23:44.589 --> 23:46.007
<i>À votre santé!</i>

23:46.633 --> 23:48.718
Camille!
It's not what you think.

23:48.802 --> 23:49.803
Bullshit!

23:56.518 --> 23:58.687
Are you sure you don't want one?

24:06.736 --> 24:09.322
Camille, wait! Can we talk?

24:09.406 --> 24:12.909
-How long has this been going on?
-It's not going on. It…

24:14.286 --> 24:15.287
It was nothing.

24:15.912 --> 24:19.958
For once, Emily, be honest.
Did you sleep with Gabriel?

24:26.548 --> 24:27.591
Camille…

24:49.654 --> 24:51.406
Oh…
