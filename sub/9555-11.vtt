(crickets chirping)

01:26.019 --> 01:27.009
Hi, Fonz.

01:28.956 --> 01:29.946
Chach.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.454
I'm glad to see you.

01:33.594 --> 01:34.993
That is glad.
Hey, what's up?

01:35.128 --> 01:36.186
You want me to fix an engine,

01:36.330 --> 01:37.388
a little overhaul,
change the...

01:37.531 --> 01:38.828
What's up?

01:38.966 --> 01:40.161
Chach...

01:40.300 --> 01:41.290
it's a solemn day.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.459
Very important day.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.196
Today, you become a man.

01:44.338 --> 01:45.601
All right!

01:45.739 --> 01:46.968
The Hooper triplets are coming!

01:47.107 --> 01:48.097
No Hooper triplets.

01:48.241 --> 01:49.538
I'm going to put
a responsibility

01:49.676 --> 01:50.973
that's going to weigh you down,

01:51.111 --> 01:52.670
the likes of which
you've never seen.

01:52.813 --> 01:55.544
Aren't I a little young
to be running for President?

01:55.682 --> 01:56.911
(laughs)

01:57.985 --> 01:58.975
Sorry, Fonz.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.948
Chach...

02:07.127 --> 02:08.252
I want you have this.

02:08.395 --> 02:10.090
Fonz...

02:10.229 --> 02:11.493
this is your little black book.

02:11.632 --> 02:12.861
Only "A."

02:13.000 --> 02:14.525
I don't want you to hurt
yourself carrying the whole set.

02:14.668 --> 02:15.760
"Susie Argas."

02:15.902 --> 02:17.495
Susie Argas...

02:17.638 --> 02:20.073
Six stars?

02:20.207 --> 02:21.641
And T.S.--

02:21.775 --> 02:22.867
T.S.?

02:23.010 --> 02:25.707
Yeah, she gives out
trading stamps.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.746
You're gonna get
an electric blanket.

02:27.881 --> 02:29.747
I'm gonna sleep in the cold.

02:29.883 --> 02:32.580
This is my dream come true!

02:32.719 --> 02:34.847
But, Fonz, wh-why you giving me
your black book?

02:37.524 --> 02:39.049
I can't tell you.

02:39.192 --> 02:40.216
I can't tell you. Uh...

02:40.360 --> 02:42.454
- There's more.
- More?

02:47.334 --> 02:48.358
<i>Pour vous.</i>

02:48.502 --> 02:51.733
My deed to my spot
at Inspiration Point.

02:51.872 --> 02:53.567
- Are you kidding?
- No kidding.

02:53.707 --> 02:54.936
And that also includes

02:55.075 --> 02:57.669
Pamela and Cricket's
gardening chores up there.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.040
This is fantastic!

02:59.179 --> 03:00.169
I don't believe it!

03:01.748 --> 03:03.045
Wait a minute.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.673
Fonz, why are you
giving me all this?

03:04.818 --> 03:06.115
You leaving town or something?

03:06.253 --> 03:08.244
I said I don't want
to talk about it.

03:10.057 --> 03:12.185
You're family,
you'll understand, all right?

03:12.325 --> 03:14.316
Sit down.

03:16.396 --> 03:17.261
(sighs)

03:17.397 --> 03:18.592
Chachi,

03:18.732 --> 03:21.861
the Fonz has decided to stop...

03:22.002 --> 03:23.993
(stammers)

03:25.505 --> 03:27.906
...dating girls.

03:30.911 --> 03:31.776
Well?

03:31.912 --> 03:33.573
(laughing)

03:33.714 --> 03:35.341
I don't believe it!

03:35.482 --> 03:36.643
The Fonz not dating girls?

03:36.783 --> 03:39.184
What a kidder!

03:40.353 --> 03:42.151
Youth.

03:45.692 --> 03:47.922
Oh, Richard, you look so nice.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.358
This another date
with Lori Beth?

03:49.496 --> 03:51.726
Yeah.
Well, after Jackie Gleason.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.799
We're gonna go see
the new Brigitte Bardot movie.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.959
Hoping it will give
Lori Beth a few ideas.

03:56.103 --> 03:56.968
(laughs)

03:57.104 --> 03:59.471
Wonder if Howard'll go.

03:59.606 --> 04:01.631
.M°m!
'(la"9hs)

04:01.775 --> 04:03.903
Well, I'm late for
Jennie Piccalds.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.978
She's having
a come-as-you-are party.

04:06.113 --> 04:07.842
Just one minute,
Joanie Cunningham!

04:07.981 --> 04:10.382
Would you just take that towel
off right this minute!

04:10.517 --> 04:12.986
I mean... well,
you know what I mean.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.110
Gotcha!

04:15.622 --> 04:17.055
You didn't get me.

04:17.190 --> 04:18.487
I knew that
you had something on.

04:18.625 --> 04:19.750
- Aw...
- Oh, Joanie.

04:19.892 --> 04:22.089
(sighs in relief)

04:22.229 --> 04:23.526
It's Brigitte Bardot.

04:23.663 --> 04:26.030
She's going to influence
this whole country.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.463
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:28.902 --> 04:30.301
A flat tire.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.302
A flat tire!

04:31.438 --> 04:33.372
And on Gleason's opening night.

04:33.507 --> 04:34.565
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

04:34.708 --> 04:35.675
- Bye, Dad.
- Have a nice time, dear.

04:35.809 --> 04:36.674
Yeah, I will.

04:36.810 --> 04:37.834
Are you out of your mind,

04:37.978 --> 04:39.412
letting her go out
looking like that?

04:39.546 --> 04:41.537
Uh, dear, don't worry.

04:41.681 --> 04:42.944
She's got clothes on underneath

04:43.083 --> 04:44.710
and it's just
to Jenny Piccalds.

04:44.851 --> 04:47.877
That last part is not
very reassuring, Marion.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.614
RICHIE: Come on, Dad, sit down.
Jackie Gleason's almost on.

04:49.756 --> 04:51.246
- Yeah. -Did you have
a nice dinner, dear?

04:51.391 --> 04:52.688
I haven't had
any dinner yet, Marion.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.055
Oh, dear, well,
I'll make you something.

04:54.194 --> 04:55.161
Not now!

04:55.295 --> 04:56.160
Wait till the commercial.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.161
All right, get ready.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.287
Okay.

04:58.431 --> 04:59.592
Richie, you watch
the TV set, huh?

04:59.733 --> 05:00.723
All right.

05:00.867 --> 05:02.392
WOMAN (on TV):
Jackie will be right back

05:02.536 --> 05:04.231
after these words
from our sponsor.

05:04.371 --> 05:05.361
Go!

05:07.808 --> 05:09.401
Um... um... um...

05:09.543 --> 05:10.704
Come on, Marion!

05:10.844 --> 05:13.074
Oh, you know,
I just crack under pressure.

05:13.213 --> 05:14.544
A sandwich, Marion.

05:14.681 --> 05:15.842
Just a sandwich!

05:15.982 --> 05:17.245
Well, let's see what we have...

05:17.384 --> 05:19.113
Okay, first commercial.

05:19.252 --> 05:21.687
Toothpaste are eating
all the bacteria germs.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.312
Oh, look, Howard.

05:23.456 --> 05:24.651
Here's some, uh, sardines.

05:24.791 --> 05:27.351
Sardines with peanut butter
and bologna, Marion?

05:27.494 --> 05:30.361
Okay, bug killer
commercial's on now.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.989
-(insect buzzes on TV)
- Here comes the bug spray can

05:33.133 --> 05:34.396
and... he sprays!

05:34.534 --> 05:35.467
(spray hissing on TV)

05:35.602 --> 05:36.569
- You got the popcorn?
- Okay.

05:36.703 --> 05:37.568
- Okay... go on...
- Got the bottles...

05:37.704 --> 05:38.830
All right, come on.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.201
RICHIE:
Five, four,

05:40.340 --> 05:43.503
three, two, one...

05:43.643 --> 05:45.475
WOMAN (on TV):
And away we go!

05:45.612 --> 05:47.205
(applause on TV)

05:47.347 --> 05:49.839
Aw, great, look, uh...

05:49.983 --> 05:52.350
(all laughing)

05:52.485 --> 05:54.544
Listen up, this is, uh,
short and sweet here.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.213
Monumentous decision.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.915
I ain't gonna
date girls no more.

05:58.058 --> 05:59.719
End of discussion.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.954
(laughing)

06:03.730 --> 06:05.027
Should've known better.

06:05.165 --> 06:07.156
It's Jackie Gleason night.

06:08.301 --> 06:10.030
Whoa.

06:10.170 --> 06:12.161
(laughter)

06:13.473 --> 06:14.634
Mmm...

06:14.774 --> 06:16.003
Here, Howard.

06:16.142 --> 06:17.439
Thanks, Marion.

06:17.577 --> 06:18.772
-(Richie chuckles)
- Mmm!

06:20.513 --> 06:23.039
<i>AL:
Hello, Acme Meat Company?</i>

06:23.183 --> 06:24.844
Al Delvecchio here.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.646
Al.

06:26.786 --> 06:28.584
Al of Arnold's.

06:28.722 --> 06:31.089
No, he went back to the Orient.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.457
Listen, I'm calling 'cause I
gotta cut down on my meat order.

06:35.595 --> 06:38.860
Well, actually,
I gotta cancel it.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.865
Well, take a look at this place.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.300
I mean, there's nobody here!

06:46.439 --> 06:48.669
Fonzie hasn't been here
in a week.

06:48.808 --> 06:50.173
No Fonzie, no girls.

06:50.310 --> 06:51.334
No girls, no guys.

06:51.478 --> 06:52.570
No guys, no Arnold's.

06:52.712 --> 06:54.009
No Arnold's, no Al...

06:54.147 --> 06:55.273
(line clicks)

06:55.415 --> 06:56.610
Hello?

06:56.750 --> 06:57.683
Hello.

06:57.817 --> 06:58.841
Well...

06:58.985 --> 07:00.612
How do you like that?

07:00.754 --> 07:03.416
He hangs up on a broken man.

07:03.556 --> 07:04.717
Look, why don't you go home?

07:04.858 --> 07:06.690
There's nothing here tonight.
Nothing.

07:06.826 --> 07:08.817

Hey...

07:15.468 --> 07:17.562
Al...

07:17.704 --> 07:19.229
your troubles are over.

07:19.372 --> 07:22.637
We brought back the two most
beautiful girls from Oshkosh.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.177
Guys, girls aren't my trouble.

07:25.312 --> 07:27.041
Not for you, Al.
For Fonzie!

07:27.180 --> 07:28.614
That's right.

07:28.748 --> 07:29.874
Simple logic, Al.

07:30.016 --> 07:32.007
The Fonz hasn't dated
for a week, right?

07:32.152 --> 07:34.678
Fonzie's merely bored
with Milwaukee girls.

07:34.821 --> 07:36.949
Therefore, ergo...

07:37.090 --> 07:38.455
Oshkosh girls!

07:38.591 --> 07:40.491
- Oshkosh, by gosh!
-(girls giggle)

07:41.995 --> 07:43.258
Uh, this cutie here,
her name's Doris.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.387
Nice smile, huh?
Great hair.

07:45.532 --> 07:47.330
Have you ever seen
a dream walking?

07:47.467 --> 07:49.128
Just once.

07:49.269 --> 07:50.327

how are ya, how are ya?

07:52.839 --> 07:54.568
(Charlene laughs)

07:54.708 --> 07:56.836
Red hair, freckles...

07:56.977 --> 07:58.968
The kind of looks
I really go for.

08:00.246 --> 08:01.372
And wait'll you hear Doris sing.

08:01.514 --> 08:03.380
RALPH:
Charlene tells jokes, Al.

08:03.516 --> 08:05.006
Good stuff. Good stuff.

08:05.151 --> 08:06.141
Go ahead, Charlene.

08:06.286 --> 08:07.879
Tell them the one
about the ant farm.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.079
- POTSIE: Ha, yeah.
- Okay, well,

08:09.222 --> 08:10.212
this ant's drivin' a tractor...

08:10.357 --> 08:11.847
Now wait a minute.
This is really funny.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.016
I didn't get
to the punch line, yet.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.388
No, I didn't mean that.

08:14.527 --> 08:16.120
I mean, look, here's Doris.

08:16.262 --> 08:17.889
She's got dark hair,
nice pretty white teeth.

08:18.031 --> 08:18.896
- Huh?
- POTSIE: Yeah.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.557
And here's Charlene.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.190
She's got red hair and freckles.

08:22.335 --> 08:25.794
And this one sings
and this one tells jokes.

08:25.939 --> 08:26.929
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

08:27.073 --> 08:29.735
Do these two remind you two

08:29.876 --> 08:32.640
of two other people you know?

08:32.779 --> 08:35.270
- No.
- No.

08:35.414 --> 08:36.405
Wow.

08:37.484 --> 08:38.712
<i>Wow'!</i>

08:38.852 --> 08:40.876
Hey, when's the Fonz
gonna get here?

08:41.020 --> 08:42.648
- Yeah...
- It won't be soon enough.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.780
(girls shrieking, laughing)

08:47.360 --> 08:49.488
Fonz, all right.

08:49.629 --> 08:52.189
You see what, uh, Ralph and
Potsie brought you from Oshkosh?

08:52.332 --> 08:53.891
Fonz, new talent, new talent.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.399
(girls squealing)

08:55.535 --> 08:56.525
Hold it!

08:59.005 --> 09:00.029
Fonzie...

09:00.173 --> 09:02.301
All right, that's it!
Conference time.

09:02.442 --> 09:04.103
I want to talk to you
in your office now!

09:06.546 --> 09:08.036
All right, Fonz, open up.

09:08.181 --> 09:10.843
Because it's unhealthy for you
to keep this inside like this.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.249
Conference time?

09:16.389 --> 09:17.584
You noticed.

09:17.724 --> 09:18.850
Now, look, I'm sorry, Fonz,

09:18.992 --> 09:20.221
but you were acting so weird

09:20.360 --> 09:21.555
it was just driving me crazy.
I'm-I'm sorry.

09:21.694 --> 09:24.561
I accept your plea of insanity.

09:24.697 --> 09:27.189
Well, it's good to have
you back to normal.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.700
I can get this pressed.

09:30.937 --> 09:32.632
Fonz, look, this thing
of not dating...

09:32.772 --> 09:34.831
I gotta tell you,
it's got me very worried.

09:34.974 --> 09:36.305
- And I appreciate it.
- Well...

09:36.443 --> 09:38.434
You know what I'm gonna do?

09:39.679 --> 09:42.307
I'm gonna give you my office

09:42.449 --> 09:44.110
when I'm gone.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.217
Gone?

09:45.351 --> 09:46.750
Yeah.

09:46.886 --> 09:50.049
I'm going down the old bike
highway for the last time.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.594
- Fonz...
- Yeah, that's right.

09:56.729 --> 09:58.060
I talked to a doctor.

09:58.198 --> 10:00.223
You're not gonna say
that you're...

10:00.366 --> 10:02.266
-y-you know...
- Worse.

10:02.402 --> 10:04.837
Worse than, than... you know?

10:04.971 --> 10:08.168
Fonz, nothing's worse
than "you know."

10:08.308 --> 10:11.209
Oh, Fonz.

10:12.912 --> 10:13.970
You gotta tell me.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.242
What is worse than "you know"?

10:16.382 --> 10:19.147
Rich...

10:19.285 --> 10:21.344
I got an allergy.

10:21.488 --> 10:23.718
An allergy?

10:23.857 --> 10:25.291
(laughs)

10:25.425 --> 10:26.859
You got an allergy!

10:26.993 --> 10:28.188
That's all, just an allergy.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.990
I don't think it's
a laughing matter.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.691
I'm sorry, but everybody's
allergic to something.

10:33.833 --> 10:35.562
I mean, I'm allergic
to strawberries.

10:35.702 --> 10:37.500
Life goes on.
I've learned to adjust.

10:37.637 --> 10:38.832
I eat blueberries instead.
I still...

10:38.972 --> 10:40.838
Hey, Richie, Richie,
what are you talking about?

10:40.974 --> 10:43.068
What I'm allergic to...

10:43.209 --> 10:45.871
there's no substitute.

10:46.012 --> 10:47.502
(shrieks)

10:47.647 --> 10:49.445
It can't be that bad, Fonz.

10:49.582 --> 10:51.107
I mean, what are
you allergic to?

10:54.053 --> 10:55.043
Girls.

10:57.000 --> 11:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here

11:10.203 --> 11:11.534
<i>RICHIE:
Fonz, you can't be serious.</i>

11:11.671 --> 11:13.765
It's just impossible
to be allergic to...

11:13.907 --> 11:15.773
to half the people in the world.

11:15.909 --> 11:16.967
I am.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.077
- Richie...
- Huh?

11:18.211 --> 11:19.235
Picture this.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.245
Inspiration Point, right?
Moonlight.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.406
- And I'm with a gorgeous girl,
right? -Yeah.

11:23.550 --> 11:24.779
And I'm moving in for the kill

11:24.918 --> 11:26.977
and then at the last moment,
right?

11:27.120 --> 11:27.985
(sneezes)

11:28.121 --> 11:30.112
I sneeze.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.515
That really gets her going, huh?

11:33.660 --> 11:35.685
I'm allergic to girls, Rich.

11:35.828 --> 11:36.886
No, I...

11:37.030 --> 11:38.293
What if you're not
allergic to girls, okay?

11:38.431 --> 11:40.525
Let's just look at some of
the environmental factors.

11:40.667 --> 11:41.691
It could be anything.

11:41.834 --> 11:43.302
You could be allergic
to, uh, corsages.

11:43.436 --> 11:44.961
Negative, I asked the girls

11:45.104 --> 11:47.801
not to bring me
any more flowers.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.636
All right, the ragweed
up at Inspiration Point.

11:49.776 --> 11:51.073
There's a lot
of ragweed up there.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.269
Negative.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.005
I asked the girls
to mow it and burn it.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.945
They did it.
It's the girls, Richie.

11:56.082 --> 11:57.675
That's just an assumption.

11:57.817 --> 11:59.785
We need scientific tests.

11:59.919 --> 12:02.854
These lips do not
touch guinea pigs.

12:05.592 --> 12:08.220
Fonz, I was talking
about testing girls.

12:08.361 --> 12:09.226
I did that.

12:09.362 --> 12:10.659
I did your test.
I did your test.

12:10.797 --> 12:11.923
I kissed every girl
in Milwaukee.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.931
You know what I got?
I got a red nose, sore lips

12:14.067 --> 12:15.262
and it's embarrassing, Richie,

12:15.401 --> 12:17.392
it's embarrassing to have
girls say, "Bless you,"

12:17.537 --> 12:18.834
when I didn't even do anything.

12:21.140 --> 12:23.074
Fonz... Fonz,
will you repeat that?

12:23.209 --> 12:24.472
I did your test.
I did your test.

12:24.611 --> 12:25.703
I kissed every girl
in Milwaukee...

12:25.845 --> 12:27.404
- Aha!
- Oh, what's "aha"?

12:27.547 --> 12:28.878
- Every girl in Milwaukee!
- Yeah.

12:29.015 --> 12:30.744
Maybe you're only allergic
to girls in Milwaukee.

12:30.883 --> 12:32.647
I mean, if...
well, no, no, that's crazy.

12:32.785 --> 12:33.843
That doesn't make any sense.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.011
No, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

12:35.154 --> 12:36.918
One, two, three, four, five,

12:37.056 --> 12:39.582
ten, 15, 20, 30, 40...

12:39.726 --> 12:41.592
It's not so crazy.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.423
I've kissed every girl
in Milwaukee, right,

12:43.563 --> 12:44.962
but I have not kissed girls
from out of town

12:45.098 --> 12:46.293
since I got these sneezes.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.695
- Is that true?
- That's true.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.268
Well, then the answer might
be right outside this door.

12:49.402 --> 12:50.426
What's that?

12:50.570 --> 12:52.004
We got the perfect subjects
for tests.

12:52.138 --> 12:55.130
Potsie and Ralph's
Oshkosh girls.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.640
Oshkosh girls?

12:56.776 --> 12:57.675
Yeah, you see that?

12:57.810 --> 12:59.278
(chuckles)
Science can be fun!

12:59.412 --> 13:00.573
I knew that, I knew that!

13:00.713 --> 13:02.238
I'll set them up.
I'll set up the test.

13:02.382 --> 13:03.349
Yeah, set it up.

13:03.483 --> 13:06.180
All right, nose,
I'm right behind you.

13:06.319 --> 13:07.753
Charlene and Doris?

13:07.887 --> 13:09.082
Fonzie's gonna be out
in just a minute.

13:09.222 --> 13:12.055
(shrieking)

13:13.192 --> 13:14.751
That's cute.
Come on down here.

13:16.663 --> 13:17.858
Guys, listen up.

13:17.997 --> 13:20.295
Uh, see,
Fonzie's problem is

13:20.433 --> 13:22.868
that he thinks that he's, uh,

13:23.002 --> 13:24.629
allergic to girls.

13:24.771 --> 13:26.432
- Nah.
- RALPH: What?! (laughs)

13:26.572 --> 13:28.768
And he's
very sensitive about it.

13:28.908 --> 13:30.603
- So don't say anything, okay?
- Got it.

13:30.743 --> 13:31.869
- POTSIE: No problem.
- Are you girls ready?

13:32.011 --> 13:33.877
-(shrieks)
- Yeah, ready!

13:34.013 --> 13:35.674
Stupid question.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.682
(girls whispering)

13:38.818 --> 13:41.810
Okay, the subject
may come out now.

13:41.954 --> 13:43.115
That's you, Fonz.

13:43.256 --> 13:44.655
I knew that.

13:44.791 --> 13:47.522
All right, this way.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.651
Okay, what you're about to see

13:49.796 --> 13:51.821
is a controlled experiment.

13:51.964 --> 13:53.398
Fonzie here, uh,

13:53.533 --> 13:55.797
thinks that he's...
allergic to girls.

13:55.935 --> 13:57.198
(laughing)

13:57.337 --> 13:59.203
Allergic to girls...

13:59.339 --> 14:00.864
(Ralph laughing)

14:01.007 --> 14:02.236
Happens to everybody, Fonz.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.366
No big deal.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.568
All right.

14:05.712 --> 14:06.645
To continue.

14:06.779 --> 14:08.838
Uh, before we test
the subject here,

14:08.981 --> 14:10.210
I'm gonna throw my own

14:10.350 --> 14:12.478
personal health to the wind

14:12.618 --> 14:14.552
and I'm gonna kiss
the girls first.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.348
Smooth, Rich, real smooth.

14:16.489 --> 14:17.422
Should we let him?

14:17.557 --> 14:18.854
Well, we gotta start somewheres.

14:18.991 --> 14:19.856
It's okay.

14:19.992 --> 14:20.982
All right.

14:33.940 --> 14:35.408
No reaction at all.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.873
It was no big thrill
for me, either, bub!

14:38.010 --> 14:39.876
Well, when I said no reaction,

14:40.012 --> 14:42.140
I meant no sneezing
or anything. I...

14:42.281 --> 14:43.305
Fonzie, you ready to try?

14:43.449 --> 14:44.848
FONZIE: Yeah, might as well
give it a shot.

14:44.984 --> 14:45.883
Okay, who's gonna be first?

14:46.018 --> 14:47.782
- I am!
- Please, pick me, pick me...

14:47.920 --> 14:49.945
RICHIE:
Uh, Charlene's first.

14:50.089 --> 14:51.648
Okay, Fonz.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.520
Fonzie, you can't kiss
through leather.

14:53.659 --> 14:55.650
I mean, it just does not work
for the experiment.

14:57.797 --> 14:58.662
Good.

14:58.798 --> 15:00.766
Okay, just give it
a shot, Fonz.

15:00.900 --> 15:01.890
(clears throat)

15:14.447 --> 15:17.382
Fonz, we're on
the right track here.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.144
Okay, go for the next one.

15:27.794 --> 15:30.388
I think I'm cured.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.294
(Richie laughs)

15:32.432 --> 15:34.332
- All right!
- Yay!

15:35.301 --> 15:38.236
My lips are happy again.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.567
The Schweitzer of Arnold's, huh?

15:40.706 --> 15:41.832
Hey, all right.

15:41.974 --> 15:42.839
- Girls, my place.
- All right.

15:42.975 --> 15:44.875
My place, I'm cured. Hey...

15:50.183 --> 15:51.275
The Fonz is cured.

15:51.417 --> 15:52.748
Yeah, great medicine.

15:52.885 --> 15:54.683
I think I'll try it
for my hay fever.

15:54.821 --> 15:56.812
I feel like Mr. Wizard.

15:58.124 --> 16:00.422
Oh, the Fonz isn't cured.

16:00.560 --> 16:01.959
Did I just miss something, Pots?

16:02.094 --> 16:04.461
He can't be allergic
to every girl in Milwaukee.

16:04.597 --> 16:05.996
It's gotta be something else.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.122
Makes sense.

16:07.266 --> 16:08.734
I just should've realized.

16:08.868 --> 16:10.859
Mr. Wizard wasn't
built in a day.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.967
(Marion humming)

16:24.283 --> 16:25.478
Surprise, sweetheart.

16:25.618 --> 16:28.053
Things were a little slow
down at the store,

16:28.187 --> 16:32.784
so I thought maybe you and I
could, maybe, uh, you know...

16:32.925 --> 16:33.790
Hi, Dad.

16:33.926 --> 16:36.156
...have lunch with Richard.

16:36.295 --> 16:38.457
- Well, how nice.
- Mmm.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.225
Hello, world!

16:40.366 --> 16:41.731
Huh? All right!

16:41.868 --> 16:43.700
Oh, good, more company.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.897
It's busier here
than it is at the store.

16:47.039 --> 16:49.269
Fonz, you look like you just won
the Indy 500 or something.

16:49.408 --> 16:51.001
Hey, I feel better.
I feel better.

16:51.143 --> 16:53.510
No allergies,
no sneezes, you know?

16:53.646 --> 16:55.978
♪ No more lonely nights. ♪

16:56.115 --> 16:57.514
Oh, Arthur, that's wonderful!

16:57.650 --> 16:58.515
Right.

16:58.651 --> 17:00.312
Well, maybe now you'll stop

17:00.453 --> 17:03.218
tuning your motorcycle
all night long, huh?

17:03.356 --> 17:05.848
Now, was it some
special medicine?

17:05.992 --> 17:07.425
Well, I'll tell you
something, Mrs. C.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.528
It was like, part Charlene,

17:09.662 --> 17:11.653
you know, part Doris, hey?

17:11.797 --> 17:14.664
Ah.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.233
Let me tell you something,
Richie.

17:16.368 --> 17:20.169
Last night we had a festive
and sneezeless night.

17:20.306 --> 17:21.171
That's right.

17:21.307 --> 17:22.433
Those girls are...

17:22.575 --> 17:24.703
- Girl Scouts.
-(knocking at door)

17:24.844 --> 17:27.472
Isn't this fun? More company.

17:27.613 --> 17:29.445
Such a fun day.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.141
Hi, how are you?

17:31.284 --> 17:33.810
Can Fonzie come out and play?

17:37.990 --> 17:39.355
Whoa...

17:40.860 --> 17:43.795
(girls giggling)

17:45.765 --> 17:47.665
(sneezes)

17:48.701 --> 17:49.930
(sneezes)

17:50.069 --> 17:51.537
- Poor Fonzie.
-(Fonzie sneezes)

17:51.671 --> 17:53.070
Poor Fonzie? Poor us!

17:53.205 --> 17:54.536
- Aw...
-(door closes)

17:54.674 --> 17:56.972
I'm gonna get
to the bottom of this.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.735
(Fonzie sneezing)

18:04.717 --> 18:06.708
(sniffling)

18:19.765 --> 18:21.392
What's the use?

18:21.534 --> 18:25.562
What do I want a whole wall
full of sneeze memories, huh?

18:25.705 --> 18:26.831
(sneezes)

18:26.973 --> 18:29.237
I'm sorry. It's just habit.

18:31.177 --> 18:33.168
Can't leave without my pil-pil.

18:35.281 --> 18:36.407
Moving?

18:36.549 --> 18:37.414
(sniffs) Yeah.

18:37.550 --> 18:38.449
Where?

18:38.584 --> 18:39.449
Hey, I don't know.

18:39.585 --> 18:40.746
You know a mountain top
for rent?

18:40.886 --> 18:42.752
Fonz, you can't
give up like that.

18:42.888 --> 18:44.982
You know, there's
a guy in Kansas

18:45.124 --> 18:46.853
had the hiccups for 15 years.

18:46.993 --> 18:48.256
He had six kids.

18:48.394 --> 18:49.418
- That man never quit.
- Yeah?

18:49.562 --> 18:51.360
I bet his wife wanted to.

18:51.497 --> 18:53.488
Look, look, let's just
start from the beginning.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.465
Did you bring the girls here
for your date last night?

18:55.601 --> 18:56.466
Correctamundo.

18:56.602 --> 18:57.728
All right.
Then the answer could be

18:57.870 --> 18:59.304
in this very apartment.

18:59.438 --> 19:02.032
I want you to tell me
exactly what you did

19:02.174 --> 19:03.198
to prepare for that date.

19:03.342 --> 19:05.106
Are you nutso?

19:06.612 --> 19:08.842
If that information got out
in the wrong hands,

19:08.981 --> 19:10.176
it might be the end
of civilization

19:10.316 --> 19:11.545
as we know it today.

19:11.684 --> 19:14.119
Well, we're gonna
have to risk it, Fonz.

19:14.253 --> 19:15.584
And you're gonna
have to cooperate.

19:15.721 --> 19:17.086
Either that or a mountain top.

19:17.223 --> 19:18.748
You ever talked to
a mountain goat, Fonz?

19:18.891 --> 19:20.290
Real dull conversation.

19:20.426 --> 19:21.689
- I mean, heh, dull.
- Hey, hey, hey.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.693
I understand dull, all right?

19:23.829 --> 19:26.628
Now look, not one living soul,

19:26.766 --> 19:28.894
living or dead, has ever
heard or seen what I do

19:29.035 --> 19:30.503
to prepare for a date,
you understand that?

19:30.636 --> 19:31.660
Right.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.898
If I show you,
it never leaves this room.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.132
Oh, I promise, Fonz.

19:35.274 --> 19:36.139
All right.

19:36.275 --> 19:38.073
Honor bright, snake bite.

19:41.047 --> 19:42.674
Honor bright,

19:42.815 --> 19:44.749
-snake bite, huh?
- Yeah.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.181
Well, uh, I'll just take that as

19:46.318 --> 19:48.286
some middle-class oath
or something like that.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.014
- Turn your back on me.
- Why?

19:50.156 --> 19:52.818
Because I don't want you to see
where I keep my master list.

19:52.958 --> 19:54.050
Oh. Yeah.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.183
All right.

19:56.962 --> 19:58.953
Turn around!

20:09.742 --> 20:10.937
Here it is.

20:11.077 --> 20:12.067
You got a check list!

20:12.211 --> 20:13.372
Hey, easy with it, easy, huh?

20:13.512 --> 20:14.570
Of course I've got a check list.

20:14.714 --> 20:15.840
I don't leave nothing to chance.

20:15.981 --> 20:17.005
Everything by the numbers.

20:17.149 --> 20:18.310
Numbers, yeah...

20:18.451 --> 20:19.976
Oh, can we skip
over one to five?

20:20.119 --> 20:21.177
I really don't want
to take a shower with you.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.015
- All right.
- Here's number six.

20:23.155 --> 20:24.645
-"Brush teeth."
- Did it.

20:24.790 --> 20:26.383
All right, seven,
"brush tongue."

20:26.525 --> 20:27.515
Did it.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.093
Eight.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.424
"Proper attire."

20:31.564 --> 20:33.862
Hey, I'm wearin' my
Wednesday night T-shirt.

20:33.999 --> 20:35.330
How do you know that?

20:35.468 --> 20:38.597
Because my Wednesday night
hanger is empty, that's why.

20:40.206 --> 20:42.334
I gotta tell you,
I wish I had a list like this.

20:42.475 --> 20:44.170
Yeah. Well, it's something
to shoot for, Cunningham.

20:44.310 --> 20:45.209
Yeah.
All right, number nine.

20:45.344 --> 20:46.539
"Set mood music."

20:46.679 --> 20:48.670
Right. Mood music, all right.

20:53.219 --> 20:55.278
<i>II</i>

20:55.421 --> 20:57.583
(music stops)

20:57.723 --> 21:00.488
Uh, Fonz, I gotta
ask you something.

21:00.626 --> 21:02.856
This, uh, number 35...

21:02.995 --> 21:03.962
Just go on to something else.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.120
Well, how do you do that?
I mean...

21:05.264 --> 21:08.234
- Oh...
- Practice, you practice.

21:08.367 --> 21:10.495
All right, number ten
is "lip exercise."

21:10.636 --> 21:12.832
Lip exercise. Check.

21:17.376 --> 21:19.140
Uh, I don't get it.
Why are you doing that?

21:19.278 --> 21:20.746
To loosen up.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.370
You can't go out
with a tight pucker.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.843
Anyway, it helps you
toward the 35, you know?

21:26.986 --> 21:28.511
Oh, yeah, 35.

21:28.654 --> 21:30.383
Man to man, Fonz,

21:30.523 --> 21:32.287
why does it say here
to yell "Geronimo"?

21:32.424 --> 21:33.391
Forget it.

21:33.526 --> 21:35.187
- Go on, what's next?
- Oh, okay.

21:35.327 --> 21:36.886
Uh, we got, uh, number eleven.

21:37.029 --> 21:38.554
"Present token of affection."

21:38.697 --> 21:39.630
- Right.
- Well, what does that mean?

21:39.765 --> 21:41.096
Well, every chick I go out with

21:41.233 --> 21:43.429
gets two spurts of,
uh, perfume, you know.

21:43.569 --> 21:45.936
Perfume! All right,
that's what you're allergic to!

21:46.071 --> 21:46.936
Is it cheap perfume?

21:47.072 --> 21:48.130
Hey...

21:48.274 --> 21:50.265
seven dollars
a bottle ain't cheap.

21:52.978 --> 21:55.470
And let me tell you something:

21:55.614 --> 21:57.605
What stuff this is...

21:58.818 --> 22:00.547
Ah, it don't make me
sneeze, either.

22:00.686 --> 22:02.552
- It don't make me sneeze.
- All right.

22:02.688 --> 22:03.553
Ooh.

22:03.689 --> 22:04.781
All right, well, uh,

22:04.924 --> 22:06.722
only one more before
we get to the good stuff.

22:06.859 --> 22:08.156
- All right, what's that?
- Number 12.

22:08.294 --> 22:09.819
Hey, number 12.
Aftershave.

22:09.962 --> 22:11.657
What kind of aftershave
do you use?

22:11.797 --> 22:13.925
Hey, it's called...

22:14.066 --> 22:15.727
"Mister Musk."

22:15.868 --> 22:16.926
I want to tell you, a few...

22:17.069 --> 22:18.161
a few splashes at night,

22:18.304 --> 22:20.295
chicks turn off the light.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.998
This stuff is the best.

22:27.146 --> 22:29.046
(Richie coughs)

22:29.181 --> 22:30.046
It is a killer!

22:30.182 --> 22:31.047
- You understand?
- Yeah...

22:31.183 --> 22:32.241
You understand? And it...

22:32.384 --> 22:34.375
I think it's better
than this perfume there.

22:35.988 --> 22:38.821
(sneezing)

22:38.958 --> 22:41.188
Wait a second!
All right.

22:41.327 --> 22:43.159
Cancel the mountain top!
I think we got it.

22:43.295 --> 22:45.195
It's a... it's a combination
of things, Fonz.

22:45.331 --> 22:47.527
It's, uh, Mister Musk

22:47.666 --> 22:49.395
and the seven dollar perfume.

22:49.535 --> 22:50.696
Watch this.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.671
Look at that.

22:55.808 --> 22:57.401
There's your allergy.

22:57.543 --> 22:58.738
It's a chemical reaction.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.869
See, the girls have got on,
uh, this stuff,

23:01.013 --> 23:04.039
you got on Mister Musk, so...
(imitates hissing)

23:04.183 --> 23:05.708
I always wondered
where the smoke came from.

23:05.851 --> 23:07.182
I always thought
it was friction.

23:07.319 --> 23:08.309
Yeah.

23:10.356 --> 23:11.346
Hey.

23:14.526 --> 23:18.292
The Fonz is cured!

23:18.430 --> 23:19.693
GIRL:
The Fonz is cured!

23:19.832 --> 23:21.823
(girls shrieking)

23:25.704 --> 23:27.035
Mr. Wizard strikes again.

23:27.172 --> 23:28.662
Hey, I want to tell you
something, Richard.

23:28.807 --> 23:30.332
You pulled me out of
this one, you know.

23:30.476 --> 23:32.444
- That's okay. -ls there some way
I could repay you?

23:32.578 --> 23:33.841
You know, there is.

23:33.979 --> 23:35.538
What's that?

23:35.681 --> 23:37.012
Will you draw me
a picture of 35?

23:37.149 --> 23:38.139
All right.

23:44.356 --> 23:46.347
<i>II</i>

23:47.860 --> 23:49.851
(talking quietly)

23:52.932 --> 23:53.956
...you take some,

23:54.099 --> 23:55.123
-and now you have some.
- Isn't this nice?

23:55.267 --> 23:56.291
Here it is Saturday night,

23:56.435 --> 23:57.664
the whole family is together,

23:57.803 --> 23:59.999
and the father is
trying to hear Gleason.

24:00.139 --> 24:01.231
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.

24:01.373 --> 24:02.738
It's just...
it's just not often that

24:02.875 --> 24:04.240
the children are home
on a Saturday night.

24:04.376 --> 24:05.434
JOANIE:
(wry chuckle) Yeah.

24:05.577 --> 24:06.806
You know, I don't know why

24:06.946 --> 24:08.243
Jenny Piccalo got grounded.

24:08.380 --> 24:11.008
It was her sister who tried
to bribe the vice squad.

24:11.150 --> 24:12.584
Joanie, Gleason.

24:12.718 --> 24:14.413
Oh, sorry, Dad.

24:14.553 --> 24:15.850
- You know...
- Shh.

24:15.988 --> 24:18.116
Dear, your father
is watching Gleason.

24:18.257 --> 24:19.520
Thank you, Marion.

24:19.658 --> 24:20.682
That's all right, dear.

24:20.826 --> 24:22.225
You know, when a man
works hard all week...

24:22.361 --> 24:24.227
Marion, Gleason.

24:24.363 --> 24:26.388
Yes, dear.

24:26.532 --> 24:28.523
FONZIE:
Geronimo!

24:29.768 --> 24:31.759
(horn "oogahs" three times)

24:35.808 --> 24:38.505
(thudding)

24:38.644 --> 24:40.635
What is he doing up there?

24:40.779 --> 24:42.440
Oh, it's-it's nothing.

24:42.581 --> 24:45.243
It'sjust... it's, uh...
