Is a prostitute,

We won't do everything possible
to convict your client --

Compared to what else
is going on,

00:37.972 --> 00:39.938

Didn't decide to send
briana mathis to the morgue.

00:44.145 --> 00:47.379
That order was given to him
by someone else.

00:47.381 --> 00:50.816
Does that not imply
a larger criminal enterprise?

00:51.785 --> 00:55.521
You want to go to the mat
for one little cog?

00:55.523 --> 00:58.157

the whole machine?

01:00.627 --> 01:02.127
We're ready to deal.

01:04.831 --> 01:09.401
Mr. Goss will name the person
or persons most responsible

01:09.403 --> 01:10.803

Once his manslaughter plea
is accepted by the court.

with information

are brought against him.

That's our offer. Yes.

I'll argue that jason

From jumping out of

No judge would believe that.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.406
Huh. What are the odds
of that?

03:43.991 --> 03:45.357
That on August 8th,

03:47.995 --> 03:50.395
At 11:30 p.M.

to commit this heinous act?

for a secure courtroom,

04:22.029 --> 04:23.161
And you have it.

04:23.163 --> 04:24.496
And now you must answer
my question.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.164
I'll repeat it.

04:26.166 --> 04:31.570
What circumstances led you
to the depraved and violent act

04:31.572 --> 04:35.807
Of shoving a 19-year-old girl
out of a moving vehicle?

04:35.809 --> 04:37.409
Your honor,

04:37.411 --> 04:38.944
To give this statement
as part of his plea deal.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.580
As such, there is no provision
for additional questions.

04:41.582 --> 04:44.249
D.D.A. Rios, you do not control
the flow of information

04:44.251 --> 04:45.917
In this courtroom,
is that clear?

04:45.919 --> 04:47.986
Yes, your honor, but I meant

relevant and appropriate.

04:51.225 --> 04:53.825
Page: Your honor, you might be
demanding information

04:53.827 --> 04:56.061
That would place my client
in potential jeopardy.

Mr. Page, the young woman
that mr. Goss murdered

05:00.134 --> 05:01.466
Was in jeopardy, too.

05:01.468 --> 05:05.470
And I need to establish
why you and d.D.A. Rios

05:05.472 --> 05:07.773
Believe that
the defendant's actions

05:07.775 --> 05:09.941

than manslaughter.

did you commit this act

05:14.214 --> 05:15.781
Entirely
of your own volition,

05:15.783 --> 05:18.784
Or was it
at someone else's direction?

05:19.986 --> 05:21.853
I was asked --
wait.

05:21.855 --> 05:25.824
I was paid to do it.

05:25.826 --> 05:26.792

05:26.794 --> 05:28.560
Again, your honor,
that information

05:28.562 --> 05:29.961

not disclosed

05:29.963 --> 05:31.697
In the agreed-upon
statement of facts

Your honor, given the potential
to prevent imminent murders,

of manslaughter.

the defendant to the crime,

that briana mathis was murdered

Like she was trash.

21:29.022 --> 21:30.121

that they would protect her,

And they couldn't.

21:36.029 --> 21:37.295
How come?

21:37.297 --> 21:42.300
Maybe because
she was a stripper...

21:42.302 --> 21:44.001
And a hooker.

21:44.003 --> 21:48.172
You know, lots of people
look down on prostitutes.

21:48.174 --> 21:49.540
Wait, a prostitute --

I thought you said
she was, like, only 19.

21:50.910 --> 21:52.576
Yeah, that's probably
what guys liked about her --

21:52.578 --> 21:53.878

the mercedes kept?

32:15.967 --> 32:17.668
A garage.

32:17.670 --> 32:19.803
Hmm.
The corner of pico
and normandie.

32:19.805 --> 32:21.138
Let's go.

32:21.140 --> 32:23.140
Keys are in there.
<i>Is that all the time?</i>

32:23.142 --> 32:24.508
<i>Was there</i>
<i>ever anywhere else?</i>

32:24.510 --> 32:26.476
Goss: <i>Yes, all the time,</i>
<i>damn it.</i>

32:26.478 --> 32:28.345
<i>You don't need to explain</i>
<i>your entire operation,</i>

32:28.347 --> 32:32.049
<i>But in order for us to prevent</i>
<i>these future murders,</i>

32:32.051 --> 32:33.450
<i>We do need to know the names</i>

32:33.452 --> 32:36.219
<i>Of the persons</i>
<i>slated to be killed.</i>

32:36.221 --> 32:38.488
And you must identify
who ordered the hits,

32:38.490 --> 32:41.024
Particularly the one
on briana mathis.

32:41.026 --> 32:42.893
[  <i>knock on door</i>]
<i>yes?</i>

32:42.895 --> 32:44.328
Sanchez: <i>Excuse me.</i>

32:44.330 --> 32:45.495
<i>I need to move this car</i>
<i>to the print shed now.</i>

32:45.497 --> 32:48.298
Sharon:
Thank you, detective.

32:53.805 --> 32:56.106
Mr. Goss?

32:57.475 --> 32:59.443
Mr. Goss?

32:59.445 --> 33:02.379
Who ordered the hit
on briana mathis?

33:02.381 --> 33:04.514
Jerry called me
that night,

33:04.516 --> 33:07.651
<i>Maybe two hours before</i>
<i>we went for our drive.</i>

33:07.653 --> 33:09.519
<i>What gave</i>
<i>briana mathis away?</i>

33:09.521 --> 33:13.290
How did jerry stone know that
she was working with the fbi?

33:13.292 --> 33:16.827
I-I don't --
I don't understand that part.

33:16.829 --> 33:20.097
Oh. [ laughs ]

33:20.099 --> 33:22.366
Cory didn't tell you that,
did he?

33:22.368 --> 33:23.500
No.

33:23.502 --> 33:26.103
<i>Briana told him</i>
<i>about the fbi</i>

33:26.105 --> 33:27.871
<i>So he can avoid</i>
<i>getting arrested.</i>

33:27.873 --> 33:31.908
<i>And then your boy, cory,</i>
<i>he went and told stone.</i>

33:32.977 --> 33:35.579
<i>Briana mathis told cory.</i>
<i>You are sure about that?</i>

33:35.581 --> 33:38.048
Mm-hmm -- well, she said he had
three days to disappear

33:38.050 --> 33:39.916
Before they grabbed him.
[ chuckles ]

33:39.918 --> 33:41.351
<i>She was protecting</i>
<i>the asshole.</i>

33:41.353 --> 33:43.954
So the organization
was more important to him

33:43.956 --> 33:45.489
Than his
girlfriend's life?

33:45.491 --> 33:47.224
Look, the bitch put cory
in a hard place.

33:47.226 --> 33:50.227
What if she was testing him
on orders from stone?

33:50.229 --> 33:53.964
If cory didn't go
to jerry immediately...

33:53.966 --> 33:55.565
He'd be dead.

33:55.567 --> 33:58.835
<i>He seems to be</i>
<i>reconsidering his actions.</i>

33:58.837 --> 34:00.504
Damn it.
<i>Yeah, that was</i>
<i>a no-win for him.</i>

34:00.506 --> 34:01.838
Damn it!

34:01.840 --> 34:03.974
In fact, I was sure jerry
was gonna get all paranoid

34:03.976 --> 34:08.245
And want to off him, too,
but I guess I read it wrong.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.148
Well, let's get
the district attorney in here

34:11.150 --> 34:13.483
And start the process.

34:13.485 --> 34:15.252
It's pretty much
the same as before,

34:15.254 --> 34:17.220
Except now I can
fill in the blanks.

34:17.222 --> 34:21.925
Jerry stone was the one
who gave me my orders

34:21.927 --> 34:23.627
<i>To abduct briana mathis.</i>

34:23.629 --> 34:25.228
And, with the cooperation
of cory stark,

34:25.230 --> 34:28.632
Who was driving,
I pushed her out of the car.

34:28.634 --> 34:30.700
Is there physical evidence
to support

34:30.702 --> 34:32.202
The defendant's confession?

34:32.204 --> 34:34.404
Yes, your honor,
we located the vehicle

34:34.406 --> 34:35.839
In which the crime
was committed,

34:35.841 --> 34:38.208
And we identified blood
belonging to mr. Goss

34:38.210 --> 34:41.211
In the backseat, along with hair
belonging to the victim.

34:41.213 --> 34:43.747
Emma: We've also
recovered text messages

34:43.749 --> 34:45.315
From mr. Goss' cellphone,
which are consistent with

34:45.317 --> 34:47.918
The timeline he outlined
and tracking data

34:47.920 --> 34:49.319
From an fbi gps locator,

34:49.321 --> 34:51.188
Which matches the route
mr. Goss says

34:51.190 --> 34:52.489
He traveled
to commit the murder.

34:52.491 --> 34:55.459
The deal which mr. Goss
agreed to includes

34:55.461 --> 34:57.661
Revealing those targeted
for murder

34:57.663 --> 35:00.997
Along with the workings of
the larger criminal enterprise.

35:00.999 --> 35:03.100
Yes, it does.

35:03.102 --> 35:06.002
Mr. Goss, given the issue
of public safety,

35:06.004 --> 35:07.404
I will accept this plea.

35:07.406 --> 35:10.774
You are hereby remanded
into state custody.

35:11.742 --> 35:15.345
Uh, now, d.D.A. Rios,

35:15.347 --> 35:16.646
Will I be seeing
the driver of the car,

35:16.648 --> 35:19.850
This cory stark,
in my courtroom, as well?

35:21.586 --> 35:23.587
No, your honor --
we regret to inform the court

35:23.589 --> 35:25.322
That cory stark
was shot to death

35:25.324 --> 35:27.591
Before we could take him
into custody.

35:27.593 --> 35:29.359
Wait. What?

35:29.361 --> 35:32.362
Mr. Stark was murdered
yesterday afternoon.

35:32.364 --> 35:33.597
The fbi's
holding several suspects

35:33.599 --> 35:35.999
As part of their
ongoing investigation.

35:36.001 --> 35:38.468
We've agreed to let them
sort it out.

35:39.237 --> 35:41.104
You people lied to me!
All right, take it easy.

35:41.106 --> 35:42.739
What do you mean, "ta--"
you lied to me!

35:42.741 --> 35:44.508
No, you lied!
Take -- take -- take it easy!
Hey! Hey!

35:44.510 --> 35:46.576
Get off!
Yeah, you lied!

35:46.578 --> 35:48.044
[ grunting ]

35:48.046 --> 35:51.414
[ handcuffs click ]

35:52.650 --> 35:54.618
Man:
All right, let's go.

36:06.531 --> 36:09.866
It's nice to confirm
that I was right,

36:09.868 --> 36:13.270
And manslaughter
was not the proper plea.

36:13.272 --> 36:15.505
I disagree, your honor.

36:15.507 --> 36:18.041
Because you held up
our original deal,

36:18.043 --> 36:19.276
A man lost his life.

36:19.278 --> 36:21.811
You're referring to
this cory stark guy,

36:21.813 --> 36:25.015
Who drove the car from which
his own girlfriend was pushed?

36:25.017 --> 36:26.716
Hold on.
I'll get you a hanky.

36:26.718 --> 36:29.052
Your honor,
may I speak frankly,

36:29.054 --> 36:30.820
Off the record?

36:31.822 --> 36:34.424
Knock yourself out.

36:35.793 --> 36:38.595
As far as I'm concerned,

36:38.597 --> 36:40.864
The failure to give
mr. Goss a deal

36:40.866 --> 36:42.666
Led directly to the execution
of another person.

36:42.668 --> 36:45.869
And that is not
how the justice system

36:45.871 --> 36:46.970
Is supposed to work.

36:46.972 --> 36:50.140
It is in my courtroom.

36:50.142 --> 36:55.612
And anyway,
we're adjourned.

Buy you
a cup of coffee.

37:14.700 --> 37:15.832
Oh.

37:15.834 --> 37:18.001
Does this mean you're not
mad at me anymore?

37:18.003 --> 37:19.402
No.

37:19.404 --> 37:23.173
It means I'm gonna
buy you some coffee.

37:23.175 --> 37:26.843
Come on.

37:53.271 --> 37:56.473
So, what's all this
secrecy about?

37:56.475 --> 38:00.543
All right. Hold on.
Uh...

38:01.879 --> 38:03.546
I'll show you, uh,

38:03.548 --> 38:06.283
But you have to swear
not to tell anyone,

38:06.285 --> 38:07.751
'cause I-I'm --

38:07.753 --> 38:11.421
I'm trusting you with
my whole life here, okay?

38:11.423 --> 38:12.889
You swear?

38:12.891 --> 38:14.624
Sure.

38:14.626 --> 38:17.360
Okay.

38:23.567 --> 38:25.368
Um...

38:25.370 --> 38:27.370
These are all letters
sent to me

38:27.372 --> 38:29.272
From some freak
who's threatening me

38:29.274 --> 38:31.474
Because I'm a witness
against phillip stroh.

38:31.476 --> 38:34.144
And they say things like,
"I'm coming for you,"

38:34.146 --> 38:37.247
And, "I'm going to hurt you
and everyone you love."

38:37.249 --> 38:38.782
Who sends them?

38:38.784 --> 38:41.518
I-I-I don't know.
Uh, they're not signed.

38:41.520 --> 38:44.020
How many are there?

38:44.022 --> 38:45.622
Well, I-I'm up to 11.

38:45.624 --> 38:47.590
And you haven't
told anyone.

38:47.592 --> 38:49.893
N-not since
the first one, no.

38:49.895 --> 38:50.994
[ sighs ]

38:50.996 --> 38:52.429
Well, uh, because that one
wasn't even so bad,

38:52.431 --> 38:53.763
And it made that emma
want to dump me

38:53.765 --> 38:55.498
Into the witness
protection program.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.133
And I cannot
let that happen.

38:57.135 --> 39:02.339
I mean, aside from the fact that
I would lose everything I have,

39:02.341 --> 39:05.208
If my mom ever
came looking for me, I...

39:05.210 --> 39:06.476
[ sighs ]

39:06.478 --> 39:08.345
I mean, we'd be
separated forever.

39:08.347 --> 39:11.081
Kris, I-I-I would never
see my mom again.

39:11.083 --> 39:14.584
But you can't just
ignore these letters.

39:14.586 --> 39:16.219
I know.
I know I can't. I know.

39:16.221 --> 39:17.854
Especially after seeing

39:17.856 --> 39:19.456
What happened to that girl,
briana.

39:19.458 --> 39:21.991
It made me realize...

39:23.728 --> 39:24.994
What?

39:24.996 --> 39:27.130
That, um...

39:31.335 --> 39:33.603
She was a witness, kris.

39:33.605 --> 39:35.472
And not only
was she murdered,

39:35.474 --> 39:38.475
But they offed
her boyfriend, too.

39:38.477 --> 39:40.610
Look, I can --
I can take care of myself,

39:40.612 --> 39:42.145
But I can't involve you.

39:42.147 --> 39:44.848
I mean, we --
we can stay friends,

39:44.850 --> 39:46.850
But I shouldn't see you
outside of school anymore.

39:46.852 --> 39:50.120
And even there,
we have to watch it.

39:50.122 --> 39:51.421
And...

39:52.456 --> 39:54.457
And -- and I should
give this back to you,

39:54.459 --> 39:57.260
Because we shouldn't be seen
as more than friends anymore.
No, no, no, I --

39:57.262 --> 39:59.229
I want you to keep it.

39:59.231 --> 40:00.597
No, no, no.

40:00.599 --> 40:02.198
Kris, kris, it would be
wrong of me to keep this.

40:02.200 --> 40:05.802
No, I-I-it's home, and I-it's
what you're fighting for.

40:05.804 --> 40:08.605
No, kris, kris, don't cry.
Kris, kris, don't cry.
I'm so sorry.

40:08.607 --> 40:09.806
Kris, someone will hear you.
Okay, you can't -- you can't --

40:09.808 --> 40:11.074
I'm so sorry.
Kris, kris, kris.

40:11.076 --> 40:13.576
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Kris, come back.

40:14.712 --> 40:16.479
Kris, you can't
tell anybody.

40:18.449 --> 40:20.083
Shaw:
I guess you're right.

40:20.085 --> 40:21.718
I guess I forgot
she was a witness

40:21.720 --> 40:23.553
And not a professional,
and that --

40:23.555 --> 40:26.856
She wasn't
on your side.

40:26.858 --> 40:30.493
No.
Briana was on her own side.

40:32.296 --> 40:35.131
She was fighting
for what she wanted.

40:35.133 --> 40:37.867
Guess I was so focused

40:37.869 --> 40:39.969
On guarding her
from the bad guys

40:39.971 --> 40:41.704
That it just never even
occurred to me

40:41.706 --> 40:45.208
She would need protection
from herself.

40:45.210 --> 40:47.644
And remember, briana didn't
become an informant

40:47.646 --> 40:50.780
By hanging out
with all the right people.

40:50.782 --> 40:55.752
Her judgment -- it was off
from the beginning.

40:55.754 --> 40:58.788
Oh, well.
We live and learn, right?

41:02.293 --> 41:04.060
