05:52.977 --> 05:54.687
Oh, no. This is a speech again, isn't it?

05:54.771 --> 05:57.190
Because Harvard is
the best school in the world.

05:57.273 --> 06:01.361
And Harvard is where my hero, development
economist, Dr. Ingrid Downs went.

06:01.444 --> 06:04.280

she is a tenured professor.

tightly wound when it comes to Harvard.

of the school. Is it "Hergerds"?

09:28.359 --> 09:30.319
You look different
when you're not all swollen.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.446
But, uh, see you at school.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.282
And, hey! Go, Bulldogs.

09:34.365 --> 09:35.575
[imitates barking]

09:39.537 --> 09:40.830
Hey, girl.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.499
It's Friday night. You got a hot date?

09:43.583 --> 09:47.003
[sighs] Well, I didn't wanna tell you,
but yes.

09:47.545 --> 09:49.964
I'm going out
with the most popular boy in school.

09:50.047 --> 09:51.924
You're going out with Graham Lansing?

09:52.008 --> 09:53.259
The Graham Lansing?

09:53.342 --> 09:56.470
Ugh, stop.
Why do you guys know who that is?

09:56.554 --> 09:57.930
I actually don't know who he is.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.099
I just felt the vibe
and wanted to "Yes, and."

10:00.683 --> 10:02.643
And now I can feel the vibe has shifted.

10:02.727 --> 10:03.728
I'm gonna go.

10:04.645 --> 10:06.147
So, no date with Graham?

10:06.230 --> 10:08.691
[Mandy] Mom,
he would never date a girl like me.

10:08.774 --> 10:09.775
What?

10:09.859 --> 10:10.860
Don't look sad.

10:10.943 --> 10:14.488
Let me remind you my worth is not
determined by some boy, okay?

10:15.031 --> 10:18.951
I'm my own woman,
and I decide my worth. [exhales]

10:19.035 --> 10:23.164
And I love that, but let me remind you
that you're only young once.

10:23.247 --> 10:25.333
I mean, it's great that you give
all those speeches

10:25.416 --> 10:28.628
and you were named
"Best Student Economist in America."

10:28.711 --> 10:29.879
Okay, in North America.

10:29.962 --> 10:32.298
Yeah, but I think
you need to have some fun,

10:32.381 --> 10:34.467
-make some memories.
-[cell phone chimes]

10:34.550 --> 10:36.344

10:36.427 --> 10:37.511
Ben: Here

10:37.595 --> 10:40.097
Oh, it was hilarious when I did it.
[laughing]

10:40.181 --> 10:41.849
Look, Mom. I have a very memorable…

10:41.932 --> 10:42.933
Mandy: OMW!

10:43.017 --> 10:44.226
…Friday night planned with Ben.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.562
Bookstore, movies, waffles.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.522
It's the same thing you do
every Friday night.

10:48.606 --> 10:50.232
See? It's memorable for you too.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.239
Hey. How was work?

10:57.323 --> 11:00.284
Work was, uh--
I don't wanna talk about it.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.334
Was it that little skid mark, Kyle?
What'd he say?

11:08.417 --> 11:11.754
It wasn't just him, I-- Look, I said
I didn't want to talk about it, okay?

11:11.837 --> 11:13.881
So, can you just stop talking about it,
please?

11:13.964 --> 11:14.965
-Okay.
-[Ben sighs]

11:19.845 --> 11:21.138
[Ben] What're you doing?

11:21.222 --> 11:22.473

or no chocolate chips in the table waffle?

12:33.377 --> 12:36.505
[Julie] That's amazing. You're so sweet.

12:38.257 --> 12:40.301
Hey, do you ever feel like

12:40.384 --> 12:43.846
we have wasted our youth sitting
on the sidelines judging people?

12:43.929 --> 12:45.681
-So, no chocolate chips?
-[song fades]

12:45.765 --> 12:48.726
Look at us. We-- We've spent
every Friday night sitting at a diner

12:48.809 --> 12:51.729
debating whether or not
we wanna put chocolate on a waffle.

12:52.396 --> 12:54.023

12:58.778 --> 12:59.779
Maybe. I don't know.

Um, you know, it's like, even Charles
and Zenobia do stuff, you know?

13:03.824 --> 13:08.788
Like, they go to games,
and they go to parties and dances.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.790
Who cares about that stuff?

13:10.873 --> 13:13.000
You and I know the truth.
None of that matters.

13:13.083 --> 13:15.836
Okay, real life starts
once we get out of here and go to college,

13:15.920 --> 13:17.797
where we get to make a real difference.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.465
Not all of us are going to Harvard.

13:19.548 --> 13:23.469
Okay? Some of us are going to an in-state
college, like, 20 minutes down the road

13:23.552 --> 13:25.596
with half the Everests
for the next four years,

13:25.679 --> 13:28.224
where we're gonna have to listen
to them wax nostalgic

13:28.307 --> 13:29.850
about their high school glory days.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.519
Because high school is all they have.

13:31.602 --> 13:34.188
Their lives have peaked.
That's why we call them Everests.

13:34.271 --> 13:36.899
But don't you wanna,
just for once, feel like…

13:37.775 --> 13:38.776
like…

13:41.070 --> 13:42.071
Like what?

13:43.531 --> 13:45.324
What if this is my peak?

13:45.825 --> 13:48.911
[scoffs] I don't have any glory days
to look back on.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.871
[chuckles] Okay, that's a little dramatic.

That's easy for you to say.
You're not No Nuts Plunkett.

13:58.796 --> 14:02.132

[Julie's date] Julie,
will you go to prom with me?

14:09.723 --> 14:12.351
[Julie] Yes! [chuckles]

-Oh, my God!

PROM?

14:38.669 --> 14:39.670
Prom?

14:40.671 --> 14:42.047
Ha, ha. Very funny.

14:42.131 --> 14:43.757
It's not a joke.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.843
Why is this not a joke?

14:46.969 --> 14:49.138
You want trite, I give you trite.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.765
But only because you're my best friend.
Okay?

14:51.849 --> 14:53.183
But no limos.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.019
I'm not paying for hair and makeup, okay?

14:55.102 --> 14:56.103
This is it.

14:57.062 --> 14:58.522
And no slow dancing.

14:58.606 --> 15:01.775
The only thing I hate more
than slow dancing is the gender wage gap.

15:02.318 --> 15:04.737
Wow, you really know how
to make a boy feel special.

Ugh.

Stop. You've been wait-listed, okay?
You haven't been rejected.

16:45.212 --> 16:46.714
It's the same thing.

16:48.924 --> 16:53.345
Harvard was supposed to be the place.
[chuckles] My place.

16:55.139 --> 16:56.682
And they don't want me either.

17:03.731 --> 17:05.232
What am I looking at?

17:09.194 --> 17:10.821
This is not the Mandy I know.

march into school
in her "Future is Female" T-shirt,

17:16.201 --> 17:18.495

to get into Harvard!

17:41.477 --> 17:42.478
I need to talk to you.

-I am with a student right now!
-Oh, that's okay. I'll wait.

18:01.747 --> 18:06.293
Okay, the only reason I'm gonna let
that fly is because I don't like that kid.

18:06.376 --> 18:08.212
-So--
-I got wait-listed at Harvard.

18:08.295 --> 18:09.755
Oh. I'm sorry.

18:09.838 --> 18:12.591
Don't be sorry.
Just help me figure out how to get in.

18:12.674 --> 18:14.593
Mandy, let's take a beat.

18:14.676 --> 18:17.971
Maybe it's finally time
to start to discuss backup schools.

18:18.055 --> 18:21.809

community service, extracurriculars--

18:21.892 --> 18:24.937
They've been applied to
and forgotten. Next.

18:25.020 --> 18:27.314
Fine. You need a killer letter of rec.

18:27.397 --> 18:30.359
Okay, I can't believe
I'm about to say this,

18:30.943 --> 18:32.694
but what about Graham Lansing's dad?

18:33.278 --> 18:36.240
The Harvard-alum senator?
That's a great idea. Ask him.

18:36.323 --> 18:40.285
Uh, I don't know him,
but I was hoping maybe you knew him.

18:40.369 --> 18:44.873
Oh, me? Yeah, we're super close.
Let's just call him right now.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.209
[humming]

18:47.292 --> 18:48.377
-Ms. Chen?
-No, be quiet.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.796
I'm trying to psychically connect
with him.

18:51.296 --> 18:53.257
[humming continues]

18:53.340 --> 18:56.135
Okay, stop! You made your point.

18:56.218 --> 18:59.513
I know that a letter from a senator
would seem big and flashy,

18:59.596 --> 19:01.348
but unless you have a magic in with him,

19:01.431 --> 19:04.977
get a rec from a teacher
who can speak to your passion,

19:05.060 --> 19:07.354
your character, your Mandy-ness.

19:07.437 --> 19:09.439
That is your best bet.

19:12.234 --> 19:14.570
Yeah, yeah. Totally. Okay, okay.

19:14.653 --> 19:16.905
Uh, I hear you, loud and clear.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.243
She don't hear me.

19:23.120 --> 19:26.165
So, Ms. Chen told you to become BFFs
with Graham Lansing

19:26.248 --> 19:29.501
so you can ask his senator father
for a letter of recommendation?

19:30.127 --> 19:32.171
Uh, not in so many words.

19:32.254 --> 19:33.714
But what's with the pushback?

19:33.797 --> 19:36.633
I thought you wanted a banal,
party-filled high school experience.

19:36.717 --> 19:38.635
Hanging out with Graham Lansing
can give you that.

19:38.719 --> 19:41.680
Yeah, I also said I want arm muscles,
but have you seen me sign up for a gym?

19:41.763 --> 19:44.141
Besides, this is-- this is manipulation,
okay? It's unethical.

19:44.224 --> 19:46.977
Are you really willing to compromise
your values for some letter of rec?

19:47.060 --> 19:50.939
Okay, this is not some letter of rec!
This is my life's ambition.

19:51.023 --> 19:54.443
Besides, there is a long history
of men taking advantage of women

19:54.526 --> 19:56.862
for things far less important
than Harvard.

19:56.945 --> 19:58.447
I don't know, Mandy.

19:58.530 --> 20:01.325
[squeals] Put me down!

20:02.951 --> 20:04.494
He's crazy.

20:05.162 --> 20:07.706
Okay, but we would, like,
hang out with all the Everests?

20:07.789 --> 20:10.334
-[indistinct announcement]
-Probably.

20:10.417 --> 20:11.418
I'm in.

20:12.377 --> 20:14.713
Let's do it. Let's live out
this little '80s movie of yours.

20:14.796 --> 20:16.173
Okay, this is not an '80s movie.

20:16.256 --> 20:19.760
In an '80s movie, Molly Ringwald falls
in love with the cute boy with dimples,

20:19.843 --> 20:22.387
going to great lengths to be with him,
future be damned.

20:22.471 --> 20:24.556
In my movie, Molly Ringwald
falls in love with Harvard,

20:24.640 --> 20:27.267
going to great lengths to get there,
dimples be damned.

20:27.976 --> 20:29.686
What are you even saying?

20:29.770 --> 20:31.521
-What are you saying?
-[Ben] What is the plan?

20:31.605 --> 20:34.107
Let's start with what we know
and then fill in the gaps.

20:34.191 --> 20:38.695
So, aside from being a popular womanizer
with a senator father,

20:38.779 --> 20:41.990
what do we know about Graham Lansing?

20:42.074 --> 20:43.909
-Uh, basketball.
-Right.

20:43.992 --> 20:44.993
Um…

20:45.994 --> 20:47.496
Basketball team.

20:47.579 --> 20:50.791
Okay. Um, so a lot of gaps.

20:50.874 --> 20:51.875
Yes, lots of gaps.

20:51.959 --> 20:55.629
It just means we check his socials.
Do some under-the-radar recon.

20:55.712 --> 20:58.382
Recon? Okay, well, who are we gonna ask?

20:59.341 --> 21:01.051
The only other people we talk to.

21:01.134 --> 21:03.971
Mandy, Ben told us. We are so sorry.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.681
We've ordered you an Edible Arrangement.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.057
Thanks, guys.

21:07.140 --> 21:10.102
Uh, but let's-- let's talk
about something normal, yeah? [chuckles]

21:10.185 --> 21:12.104
-Normal?
-You know, like, uh…

21:12.688 --> 21:14.773
Uh, Graham. Lansing.

21:14.856 --> 21:19.611
What-- What does he do?
You know, besides basketball.

21:19.695 --> 21:20.904
Very under the radar.

21:21.863 --> 21:24.992
Okay. He's probably going
to Kayla Jacobson's party tonight.

21:25.075 --> 21:26.994
The entire senior class is going.

21:27.077 --> 21:29.162

-Ouch.

We have AP Psych together.

21:33.667 --> 21:36.837
Last week, I heard Graham talking
to the teacher about needing extra credit.

Zenob, baby, we gotta go.
Bethany's making money moves.

21:39.631 --> 21:41.842
She's eating with the color guard girls
in the band room.

21:42.801 --> 21:47.431
She will not stop until she has my head
on a platter. Let's go.

21:47.514 --> 21:48.765
Okay, wait.

21:50.684 --> 21:53.228
I got it.
Okay, we go to the party tonight…

21:53.312 --> 21:54.730
-Whoa, okay.
-…talk to Graham.

21:55.230 --> 21:57.399
I'll offer to tutor him in psych for free.

21:57.482 --> 22:01.445
Then once I earn his trust, I will ask him
to ask his dad for the letter of rec.

22:01.528 --> 22:04.281
Okay. Okay, so the plan is, uh,

22:04.364 --> 22:07.200
we-- we stage a run-in
with the most popular guy in school,

22:07.284 --> 22:11.705
whom we have never spoken to before,
at a party that we were not invited to,

22:11.788 --> 22:15.042
and then charm him by super casually
bringing up his failing grades.

22:15.125 --> 22:17.169
And then ask him for a gigantic favor.

22:17.252 --> 22:19.713

for fear of being rejected?

into account the girl's interests or life.

Thank you, LaToya Reynolds.

31:42.901 --> 31:43.902
[chuckles]

31:46.571 --> 31:49.657
-There are people in line behind you.
-Right, behind-- Okay, I'll--

31:49.741 --> 31:50.950
So sorry. Um--

31:51.034 --> 31:54.120
Ebbinghaus was famous
for his forgetting curve,

31:54.203 --> 31:57.498
which shows that you forget about 75%
of the information you learn in a day

31:57.582 --> 31:59.542
without relearning or repetition.

31:59.626 --> 32:02.378
Which is kind of what makes tutoring
such an effective tool.

32:02.462 --> 32:03.838
Can you stop with the tapping?

32:03.922 --> 32:07.008
Sorry, but if you're just gonna sit here
and talk at me like Ms. Allen does,

32:07.091 --> 32:08.092
I'm gonna get antsy.

32:08.176 --> 32:11.429
Like it's my fault you have
the attention span of a golden retriever.

32:12.472 --> 32:14.641
Well, this was fun.

32:14.724 --> 32:17.435
Thank you. I'll let you know
how I do on the next test.

32:17.518 --> 32:18.937
Wait. I'm sorry.

32:19.896 --> 32:21.272
[sighs] I'm sorry.

32:22.106 --> 32:24.651
-Can we start over?
-I don't think this is gonna work.

32:25.234 --> 32:26.235
You're right.

32:28.529 --> 32:29.822
Follow me.

32:30.615 --> 32:31.616
You serious?

32:32.367 --> 32:34.452
You said it yourself. You get antsy.

32:34.535 --> 32:38.665
So, let's redirect that nervous energy
into something else so you can focus.

32:38.748 --> 32:41.417
It'll be like a fidget spinner for jocks.

32:41.501 --> 32:42.627
We prefer the term athletes.

32:42.710 --> 32:44.128
I'm sure you do.

32:44.212 --> 32:46.547
So, Ebbinghaus's forgetting curve says

32:46.631 --> 32:51.386
you forget 75% of the information
you learn in one day without relearning.

32:51.469 --> 32:53.096
-[Graham] He shoots.
-What did I just say?

32:53.179 --> 32:55.264
He scores.

32:56.557 --> 32:59.060
You said
Ebbinghaus's forgetting curve says

32:59.143 --> 33:05.441
we forget up to 75% of the things
we learn in a day without relearning them.

33:07.819 --> 33:09.821
-You might be onto something.
-["bad guy" playing]

33:09.904 --> 33:12.699
The stereotype threat is
where someone does worse academically

33:12.782 --> 33:14.617
because they're told
they're not good enough.

33:14.701 --> 33:17.161
Oof. That one hits deep.
Thanks a lot, Dad.

33:17.662 --> 33:19.288
[song continues]

33:19.372 --> 33:20.832
Mandy, heads up.

33:22.333 --> 33:23.334
No.

33:23.418 --> 33:25.628
So, me being able to remember
the last thing you said

33:25.712 --> 33:27.839
is an example of the recency effect.

33:27.922 --> 33:29.298
That actually makes sense.

33:29.382 --> 33:31.259
You can store that explicit memory…

33:33.886 --> 33:35.054
in your hippocampus.

33:35.138 --> 33:36.764
-Am I right?
-You actually are.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.725
Huh. Look at me learning.

33:39.475 --> 33:41.436
-Mandy, I got an 88 on my quiz.
-[song continues]

33:41.519 --> 33:43.271
-[squeals]
-[Mandy chuckles]

33:43.354 --> 33:45.023
Did Graham Lansing just hug you?

33:45.106 --> 33:48.985
Girl, that was not just a hug.
He slid into your DMs with his eyes.

33:49.068 --> 33:50.194
It is on.

33:50.278 --> 33:51.529
It is not like that.

33:51.612 --> 33:54.115
Girl, it should be, 'cause he is hot.

33:55.324 --> 33:57.160
[no audible dialogue]

33:57.243 --> 33:59.787
[song continues]

33:59.871 --> 34:03.249
[student] Oh, my God. Yes, I'll go to prom
with you! Oh, my God! [laughs]

34:04.876 --> 34:07.962
-Claire, will you go to prom with me?
-Yes, I'll go to prom with you!

34:08.713 --> 34:10.923
I bet his girlfriend
doesn't even like John Cusack.

34:13.760 --> 34:16.888
-It's called priming.
-[song ends]

34:16.971 --> 34:19.348
Now, get up. New plan.

34:19.432 --> 34:22.977
You have spent all this time tutoring me.
Now let me tutor you.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.729
No, I don't play basketball.

34:24.812 --> 34:26.522
What? You have to.

34:26.606 --> 34:30.777
You said that when we store memories,
we store the emotion we felt at the time.

34:30.860 --> 34:35.615
And, well, you don't want me associating
psychology with being sad now, do you?

34:36.449 --> 34:37.450
[sniffles]

34:37.533 --> 34:39.202
Okay, okay. I'll do it.

34:39.285 --> 34:41.162
Just stop making that face.

34:41.245 --> 34:44.165
Okay. So the acronym we use
to teach shooting is BEEF.

34:44.248 --> 34:47.835
Now, I'm sorry if that offends you
as a vegetarian.

34:47.919 --> 34:49.837
How did you know I was a vegetarian?

34:49.921 --> 34:50.922
Just assumed.

34:51.672 --> 34:53.549
Okay. BEEF.

34:53.633 --> 34:56.469
Balance: feet shoulder width apart.

34:56.552 --> 34:58.679
Eyes: up and on the hoop.

34:58.763 --> 35:01.015
Elbow: under the ball.

35:01.099 --> 35:03.017
And, finally, follow-through.

35:03.101 --> 35:06.020
Keep moving your hand after
you release the ball to finish your shot.

35:10.942 --> 35:12.860
[scoffs] Well, that was pathetic.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.112
Hey.

35:14.195 --> 35:17.448
What? If I said that was good, you would
lose all respect for me as a coach.

35:17.532 --> 35:18.783
Okay, let's try again.

35:20.368 --> 35:21.369
Balance.

35:21.911 --> 35:22.912
Eyes.

35:23.788 --> 35:24.789
Elbow.

35:26.457 --> 35:27.792
Follow-through.

35:30.461 --> 35:33.548
Whoa! Did LeBron just get here?

35:35.216 --> 35:36.259
Okay, get ready.

35:37.009 --> 35:40.263
Let me just make one more tweak.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.559
Do I have permission to touch your arm?

35:45.977 --> 35:46.978
Yes.

35:48.604 --> 35:52.441
You flare out just a little bit here.

35:52.525 --> 35:53.860
Okay. You're good.

35:55.278 --> 35:56.487
Eyes on the basket.

35:57.780 --> 36:01.409
You sink this,
it means I'm acing my psych test.

36:03.035 --> 36:04.203
No pressure.

36:07.498 --> 36:08.499
[exhales]

36:12.211 --> 36:13.838
[both cheer]

36:13.921 --> 36:15.506
I did it! Everyone here saw it.

36:15.590 --> 36:17.383
I leave here a champion!

36:17.466 --> 36:20.011
[imitating Mandy] "Oh, Graham,
thank you so much for all your help.

36:20.094 --> 36:21.804
I-I couldn't have done it without you."

36:21.888 --> 36:23.764
Oh, thank you. You are a good coach.

36:23.848 --> 36:26.976
[scoffs, normal] Well, I'd hope so.
I coach at the rec center.

36:27.852 --> 36:28.978
-Really?
-Yeah.

36:29.061 --> 36:30.062
I am the proud head coach

36:30.146 --> 36:32.732
of the nine-year-old
West Division Co-Champ Lil Bulldogs.

36:33.232 --> 36:34.233
Really?

36:34.317 --> 36:36.736
I've been with them
since they were wee six-year-old pups.

36:36.819 --> 36:39.280
-Really?
-Could you stop sounding so surprised?

36:39.780 --> 36:41.574
Just 'cause I don't advertise it
on my T-shirt,

36:41.657 --> 36:43.117
doesn't mean I'm not a good person.

36:43.618 --> 36:46.996
But if you need to see it to believe it,
come with me.

36:48.206 --> 36:49.665
[whistle blows]

36:49.749 --> 36:51.209

-[player] No!
-[players] Yes! Yes!

Oh!

-Nice job.
-[whistle blows]

37:32.708 --> 37:33.709

37:33.793 --> 37:36.545
Okay, you guys were amazing today.

37:36.629 --> 37:39.048
So amazing, I'll make you a deal.

37:40.299 --> 37:41.759
If I make this shot…

37:42.760 --> 37:44.887
I'll bring doughnuts to the next practice.

37:50.393 --> 37:52.603
-[players cheering]
-Yeah.

37:52.687 --> 37:55.356
There will be doughnuts for everyone.

37:55.439 --> 37:56.691
[players laughing]

37:57.275 --> 37:58.985
-You got hops.
-Really?

37:59.610 --> 38:02.905
No. But Coach always tells us
sportsmanship is important.

38:02.989 --> 38:04.657
Well, he makes a good point.

38:05.199 --> 38:08.077
But, be honest, I'm not the worst girl
he's brought here, right?

38:08.160 --> 38:10.288
You're the only girl
he's ever brought here.

38:14.750 --> 38:18.921
Hey. Guess what? I am tutoring Graham
at his house on Friday night.

38:19.005 --> 38:21.674
Where he lives with Senator Lansing.

38:21.757 --> 38:24.635
Wait. Friday night as in Mandy
and Ben's bookstore-movie-waffle night?

38:24.719 --> 38:25.845
Yeah, I know. It sucks.

38:25.928 --> 38:28.806
We're gonna have to skip the bookstore
and push back the movie.

38:28.889 --> 38:29.890
Are you mad?

38:31.100 --> 38:34.687
No. I mean, as long as we can make it
to the movie, it's fine.

38:34.770 --> 38:36.439
It's better than fine. It's good.

38:36.939 --> 38:38.816
The Harvard Gods have given you a sign.

38:38.899 --> 38:41.819
You can't ignore them, or they might
smite you and make you go to Brown.

38:41.902 --> 38:43.571
Oh, don't even joke about that.

38:56.125 --> 38:57.501
What am I doing?

38:59.545 --> 39:01.797
-Hi.
-You must be Mandy.

39:01.881 --> 39:02.798
-Yeah.
-Come on in.

39:02.882 --> 39:04.425
-Thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

39:05.801 --> 39:08.179
It's so nice to finally meet
the miracle worker

39:08.262 --> 39:10.973
who helped my son get
a B-plus on his test.

39:11.057 --> 39:12.558
-Oh.
-He's so proud.

39:12.641 --> 39:14.226
He even put it on the fridge.

39:14.310 --> 39:15.686
-Oh.
-[laughs]

39:15.770 --> 39:16.771
Graham?

39:20.691 --> 39:21.984
Hey.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.946
Oh, for God's sake, Graham,
put a shirt on.

39:26.030 --> 39:27.490
Your tutor is here.

39:27.990 --> 39:29.116
I'll be right down.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.827
Oh. I'm so sorry.

39:32.328 --> 39:34.246
Raising four boys has taught me one thing.

39:34.330 --> 39:36.999
It's they think this whole house
is a fancy locker room.

39:37.083 --> 39:38.751
-Oh.
-We're lucky he's wearing pants.

39:39.794 --> 39:41.420
-So lucky.
-[Mrs. Lansing laughs]

39:41.504 --> 39:42.546
[cell phone ringing]

39:42.630 --> 39:45.424
-Oh. Make yourself at home, sweetie. Okay?
-Thanks.

39:45.508 --> 39:47.510
[ringing continues]

39:51.055 --> 39:52.264
[Mrs. Lansing] Hello.

39:52.348 --> 39:54.517
Oh, yes. I've been meaning to call you.

39:58.813 --> 40:00.773
HARVARD UNIVERSITY
TEDDY LANSING

40:00.856 --> 40:03.484
National Academic Decathlon
3RD PLACE - TEDDY LANSING 2015

40:05.528 --> 40:07.446
You found the Lansing wall of fame.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.407
[chuckles] It's very impressive.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.743
Your brother went to nationals
in Academic Decathlon?

40:12.827 --> 40:16.038
Teddy? Yeah, he got third place.
Cried afterwards.

40:16.122 --> 40:17.581
[chuckles]

40:17.665 --> 40:18.666
Where are you?

40:20.918 --> 40:22.336
[chuckles] Aw.

40:23.003 --> 40:24.588
But where's the real stuff?

40:25.089 --> 40:27.842
You know, being crowned homecoming king

40:27.925 --> 40:30.636
and winning basketball player of the year
or whatever.

40:31.137 --> 40:33.806
It's called MVP.
And none of that counts for the wall.

40:33.889 --> 40:37.309
According to my father, the wall
is reserved for actual achievements,

40:37.393 --> 40:40.187
not silly games or popularity contests.

40:40.271 --> 40:43.691
He's a senator. His job is literally
winning a popularity contest.

40:43.774 --> 40:44.775
That's what I said.

40:44.859 --> 40:48.028
And now I'm stuck on the wall
with my fifth-grade graduation picture.

40:50.489 --> 40:52.658
Let's go get me on this wall
for real, huh?

40:54.160 --> 40:58.247
The Babinski reflex and the Moro reflex.

40:58.330 --> 41:00.207
[Mandy] Correct. And that's it for today.

41:00.291 --> 41:02.918
[Graham] It looks like we got time
to work on that jumper.

41:04.420 --> 41:06.589
So, what's the deal with your folks?

41:06.672 --> 41:07.673
You guys get along?

41:08.466 --> 41:10.843
Person with the ball
has to answer the questions.

41:10.926 --> 41:13.137
It's kind of the rule
of our tutoring sessions.

41:13.929 --> 41:15.222
Fine. Uh…

41:16.182 --> 41:21.020
Yeah, we do for the most part,
just normal annoying parent stuff.

41:21.687 --> 41:23.230
-You?
-I don't have the ball.

41:23.314 --> 41:24.773
I don't have to answer your question.

41:24.857 --> 41:28.110
Hmm. Do you get along with your parents?

41:29.987 --> 41:32.323
Uh, yeah, with my mom it's easy.

41:32.406 --> 41:34.533
Hmm, she's a talker, but my dad…

41:35.701 --> 41:37.411
No matter how hard I try, I just--

41:38.120 --> 41:39.955
I just can't live up to his standards.

41:40.039 --> 41:42.124
You know, the only reason
I took this AP class

41:42.208 --> 41:45.336
is so maybe he'd think of me
as not a complete idiot for once.

41:46.795 --> 41:49.173
-[sighs] Sorry.
-For what?

41:49.924 --> 41:52.551
People don't wanna listen
to Graham Lansing's daddy issues.

41:53.219 --> 41:54.345
I'll listen.

42:00.809 --> 42:01.936
Who's your best friend?

42:02.019 --> 42:03.437
Ben Plunkett.

42:03.521 --> 42:05.272
No Nuts Plunkett is your best friend?

42:05.356 --> 42:07.107
Yes. And don't call him that.

42:08.359 --> 42:09.610
Who's your best friend?

42:10.528 --> 42:11.737
Owen Kirksey.

42:11.820 --> 42:12.821
Favorite movie?

42:13.489 --> 42:14.573
<i>9 to 5</i>.

42:14.657 --> 42:15.824
Favorite book?

42:15.908 --> 42:16.909
<i>Unbroken</i>.

42:16.992 --> 42:18.327
First kiss?

42:18.410 --> 42:20.204
Peter Garcia. Seventh grade.

42:20.287 --> 42:21.288
Last kiss?

42:21.372 --> 42:23.123
Sophie Homan. Kayla's party.

42:23.624 --> 42:25.876
Did you think
I was just a dumb jock before this?

42:25.960 --> 42:27.086
Yes.

42:27.169 --> 42:30.005
-Did you know who I was before this?
-No.

42:30.089 --> 42:31.340
Why'd you offer to tutor me?

42:32.299 --> 42:34.969
Dinner in 15 when your dad gets home.
Get cleaned up.

42:35.052 --> 42:37.721
Dad's joining us for dinner?
To what do we owe the pleasure?

42:37.805 --> 42:40.391
Get it all out now before he gets here.

42:40.474 --> 42:42.142
Hey, do you wanna stay for dinner?

42:42.226 --> 42:43.352
With your parents?

42:43.852 --> 42:46.855
-Right. That's weird. You don't have to--
-No, I want to.

42:48.065 --> 42:51.318
Unless you wanna take it back,
in which case, I don't have to. [chuckles]

42:52.319 --> 42:54.488
I want you to. It's why I asked.

42:56.198 --> 42:58.784
-Okay. Then I'm in.
-Good.

43:01.036 --> 43:02.871
-I'm gonna go wash up.
-[Mandy] Okay.

43:07.585 --> 43:10.713
Ben:
Have I read this?? nvm. got tix.

43:10.796 --> 43:13.465
hellooooo… hv u left Graham's?

43:16.218 --> 43:17.219
[sighs]

43:18.137 --> 43:22.933
Mandy:
So sorry gotta bail. Eating at Graham's!

43:23.017 --> 43:24.018
[cell phone chimes]

43:27.021 --> 43:29.898
Ben:
ur bailing to hang with GRAHAM?!

43:30.482 --> 43:33.777
Mandy: It's for my future!!
His dad's gonna be here.

43:33.861 --> 43:35.112
Can you return the ticket?

43:38.490 --> 43:39.867
Ben: ill try

43:45.706 --> 43:47.041
-LaToya Reynolds!
-Oh!

43:47.750 --> 43:50.169
[sighs] Ben Plunkett, you scared me.

43:50.252 --> 43:51.837
Oh, I'm so sorry. So sorry.

43:51.920 --> 43:54.923
I'm just-- I'm surprised to see you here.

43:55.007 --> 43:56.967
Because I'm not going
to Corey Eckhart's party?

43:57.051 --> 44:01.263
Yeah, yes, 'cause I--
I am definitely aware of that party.

44:01.347 --> 44:03.349
So, why aren't you going?

44:04.266 --> 44:06.810
Every once in a while,
I just need a break from that scene.

44:06.894 --> 44:09.229
Yeah, I mean-- [scoffs] Same. [chuckles]

44:09.938 --> 44:11.315
I thought you could relate.

44:12.983 --> 44:14.693
Uh-- What are you here to see?

44:15.361 --> 44:16.362
<i>Infinite Doom</i>.

44:16.862 --> 44:20.783
Scary movies are not my thing, but where
Michael B. Jordan goes, I follow.

44:20.866 --> 44:23.661
Well, I'm here to see that too.
Do you wanna go together?

44:23.744 --> 44:25.829
Not together, of course.
Obviously not together.

44:25.913 --> 44:27.456
I just meant, like, would you--

44:27.539 --> 44:29.625
Would you wanna go as friends?
Or you know what?

44:29.708 --> 44:32.419
Now that I say it out loud,
friends may be presumptuous.

44:32.503 --> 44:33.671
I can totally hear that now.

44:33.754 --> 44:36.632
What I mean to say is
that I have this extra ticket,

44:36.715 --> 44:38.967
and you can totally have it
if you want it.

44:39.051 --> 44:42.971
And it would just be, like, one classmate
helping out a fellow classmate.

44:43.055 --> 44:44.515
Nothing more than that. You know what?

44:44.598 --> 44:47.726
We don't even need to sit next to
each other if you don't want to, so…

44:49.978 --> 44:52.481
I'd be happy to help out
a fellow classmate.

44:53.941 --> 44:55.567
And we can sit next to each other.

44:55.651 --> 44:57.945
Great. 'Cause the seats are assigned.

44:58.779 --> 45:01.699
So your dad won't be joining us. [sighs]

45:01.782 --> 45:04.368
He got pulled into last-minute drinks
with a donor.

45:04.451 --> 45:07.121
Can't be missed.
Reelection's right around the corner.

45:07.204 --> 45:08.789
[Graham] Well, I, for one, am shocked.

45:08.872 --> 45:11.083
[Mrs. Lansing] Stop it. He works hard.

45:11.166 --> 45:14.086
So, Mandy, where are you off to next year?

45:14.169 --> 45:18.882
The way Graham talks about you, I imagine
you must have your pick of schools.

45:18.966 --> 45:22.219
[groans] Well-- You know,
my first choice is Harvard.

45:22.302 --> 45:24.763
I wanna study under Dr. Downs.
She's this amazing--

45:24.847 --> 45:25.848
I know who she is.

45:25.931 --> 45:27.349
I love her.

45:27.433 --> 45:30.144
-I went to her book signing last year--
-Uh, me too.

45:30.227 --> 45:31.645
-What?
-Yeah.

45:31.729 --> 45:34.940
[laughs] Where have you been hiding?

45:35.023 --> 45:38.610
The last girl Graham brought home asked
why we didn't live in the White House.

45:38.694 --> 45:41.488
[chuckles] Mandy's my tutor, Mom.

45:41.572 --> 45:43.490
-Okay? She's not like Tess.
-No.

45:43.574 --> 45:46.118
-Or Jenna or Hannah or Taylor.
-Stop.

45:46.201 --> 45:47.828
[laughs] Kidding.

45:49.163 --> 45:53.250
Mandy, so please, go on.
You're going to Harvard.

45:53.333 --> 45:54.585
Oh, hopefully.

45:55.294 --> 45:56.295
I got wait-listed.

45:56.378 --> 45:58.589
Oh, that's a shame.

45:59.673 --> 46:01.675
Did you know my husband went to Harvard?

46:03.510 --> 46:07.890
Uh, no. I had no idea.
Wow. That is so impressive. [chuckles]

46:09.516 --> 46:12.186
You know, I would love the opportunity
to pick his brain.

46:12.269 --> 46:13.729
See if he has any tips.

46:14.229 --> 46:15.397
Only if he has the time.

46:16.190 --> 46:19.026
[Mrs. Lansing] Oh, well,
clearly his schedule is unpredictable.

46:19.526 --> 46:23.572
But, you know, next weekend there's
a fundraiser where he's being honored.

46:23.655 --> 46:26.033
The whole family is going.

46:26.617 --> 46:29.119
You should come.
You could talk to him then.

46:29.661 --> 46:31.497
-You don't have to.
-I would love to.

46:32.539 --> 46:35.751
[Mrs. Lansing] Excellent.
I will have Graham get you the details.

46:41.215 --> 46:44.009
-[Ben] What did you think of the movie?
-[LaToya] I'm just gonna say it.

46:44.092 --> 46:46.261
-Michael B should be in every movie.
-[Ben] Okay.

46:46.345 --> 46:50.641
[LaToya] Even the old ones.
<i>Titanic</i>, <i>Godfather</i>, <i>Citizen Kane</i>.

46:51.141 --> 46:53.560
Go back. Remake 'em all with him in it.

46:53.644 --> 46:54.895
Okay. So, you liked it?

46:54.978 --> 46:57.689
It-- It was hard to tell.
You spent the whole movie like this.

46:57.773 --> 46:58.774
I did not.

46:58.857 --> 47:02.069
I'm pretty sure I have a bruise on my arm
from how hard you were leaning into me.

47:02.152 --> 47:03.237
Shut up!

47:03.320 --> 47:05.989
-Oh, I'm sorry. Did that hurt?
-A little. [chuckles]

47:07.157 --> 47:09.493
Well, this is me.

47:10.452 --> 47:11.453
I had fun.

47:12.037 --> 47:13.330
I'm glad Mandy canceled.

47:15.666 --> 47:18.335
You said you two usually grab waffles
after a movie?

47:18.418 --> 47:19.419
Yep.

47:22.965 --> 47:25.509
-Do you wanna--
-I will see you at school. [chuckles]

47:27.386 --> 47:28.595
See you at school.

47:30.931 --> 47:34.184
See you at school?
What are you doing, Ben? [grunts]

47:34.852 --> 47:36.895
Why am I running?
This is only making it worse.

47:36.979 --> 47:38.105
Why am I making it worse?

47:40.274 --> 47:42.651
You made quite the impression
on my mom tonight.

47:42.734 --> 47:47.197
[chuckles] I guess I have Britney,
Tiffany, Rachel and Jessica to thank.

47:47.281 --> 47:49.074
-You're just making up those names.
-[laughs]

47:49.157 --> 47:51.201
But how many of them
are girls you've dated?

47:51.285 --> 47:52.411
Uh, two-ish.

47:52.494 --> 47:54.288
Oh, I feel bad for that ish-girl.

47:54.371 --> 47:55.581
No, she was very happy.

47:55.664 --> 47:56.832
[chuckles] Gross.

47:57.875 --> 47:58.876
Good night, Graham.

48:04.506 --> 48:05.507
Wait, wait.

48:07.843 --> 48:09.928
I'm glad you're coming to the fundraiser.

48:10.012 --> 48:12.723
My dad's gonna freak
when I show up with a Harvard girl.

48:12.806 --> 48:14.391
The hopeful Harvard girl.

48:14.474 --> 48:16.643
Look, either way, he'll be very impressed.

48:19.688 --> 48:20.814
[smacks lips]

48:20.898 --> 48:24.902
He wouldn't even let me apply there,
and I'm a legacy basketball recruit…

48:24.985 --> 48:26.194
[sighs]

48:26.278 --> 48:28.906
…but my dad didn't think
I would be able to hack it, so…

48:29.573 --> 48:31.909
"Let's just minimize
potential embarrassment."

48:34.119 --> 48:35.245
That's rough.

48:36.788 --> 48:38.832
But you should've done it anyway.

48:39.750 --> 48:42.252
You don't have to live your life
for his approval.

48:47.007 --> 48:48.592
You my tutor or my therapist?

48:48.675 --> 48:51.303
Sorry. [chuckles]
You didn't ask for my opinion.

48:51.386 --> 48:52.387
No, no. I…

48:53.472 --> 48:54.473
I like hearing it.

48:56.266 --> 48:58.185
All right. I could stay here all night,

48:58.268 --> 49:00.812
but Coach will kill me if I don't
get sleep before the tournament.

49:00.896 --> 49:03.023
-Right. Good luck.
-Don't miss me too much.

49:11.031 --> 49:12.032
[chuckles]

49:17.704 --> 49:18.705
[sighs]

49:23.794 --> 49:25.087
Oh, finally. Okay.

49:25.587 --> 49:27.673
Is this jacket '80s enough?
'Cause I asked Ruth,

49:27.756 --> 49:30.258
and she said the women's jackets
would fit my shoulders better.

49:30.342 --> 49:32.386
But I don't have lady shoulders, do I?

49:32.469 --> 49:34.930
Uh, no, your shoulders are totally normal.

49:35.639 --> 49:38.600
Whoa. I just insinuated
having lady shoulders was a bad thing,

49:38.684 --> 49:41.144
and you didn't even notice. Are you okay?

49:41.228 --> 49:43.188
Yeah, yeah. Sorry, I'm fine. I--

49:43.271 --> 49:46.441
It's just that Graham Lansing
is not who I thought he was.

49:46.525 --> 49:49.277
It's like when you find out
your parents aren't just your parents

49:49.361 --> 49:50.779
and had a whole life before you.

49:50.862 --> 49:52.155
It feels kinda weird, you know?

49:52.239 --> 49:54.574
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
This one's kinda good though, right?

49:54.658 --> 49:57.077
[Ruth] Your shoulders are too narrow
for that jacket!

49:57.160 --> 49:58.286
Thank you, Ruth! [sighs]

49:58.370 --> 50:00.330
-She's got a point.
-Are you serious right now?

50:00.414 --> 50:01.832
-I'm kidding. Sort of.
-Okay.

50:01.915 --> 50:03.291
I think you can do better.

50:03.875 --> 50:04.876
Ooh.

50:04.960 --> 50:06.586
["Reinvent Urself" playing]

50:06.670 --> 50:08.463
[no audible dialogue]

50:12.634 --> 50:14.261
[no audible dialogue]

50:15.429 --> 50:16.805
Wear it like a cape.

50:23.979 --> 50:27.607
[song continues]

50:27.691 --> 50:29.067
[song ends]

50:29.151 --> 50:32.154
Great Scott, will you go to prom with me?

50:32.237 --> 50:33.613
Oh, my God! Yes!

50:33.697 --> 50:35.782
-Oh, my God. I love this.
-Oh, thank you.

50:36.283 --> 50:37.659
You have to…

50:37.743 --> 50:39.494
Mandy: Because I know how much
you love promposals.

50:39.578 --> 50:42.789
[Principal] <i>Attention, this is</i>
<i>a reminder. The library is for reading…</i>

50:42.873 --> 50:44.458
Graham:
bc i know how much you love my selfies

50:44.541 --> 50:46.418
<i>…not for scrolling your social medias.</i>

50:46.501 --> 50:48.587
Mandy: Deleting this ASAP
Wouldn't want the girls to be jealo

50:48.670 --> 50:50.255
Mandy! Who you texting?

50:51.339 --> 50:52.340
Uh, my mom.

50:52.424 --> 50:54.676
-What's up?
-Where are we going Saturday night?

50:54.760 --> 50:56.845
I'm thinking we class it up
and go to the Olive Garden.

50:56.928 --> 50:58.930
-What are you talking about?
-My birthday dinner.

50:59.014 --> 51:00.182
Crap.

51:01.058 --> 51:03.727
The fundraiser with Graham's dad
is Saturday night.

51:03.810 --> 51:05.937
Seriously? Graham again?

51:06.021 --> 51:08.190
Not Graham. The letter.

51:08.774 --> 51:10.358
Oh, let's do Friday night instead.

51:10.442 --> 51:13.361
I told you we're going to my grandma's
retirement community on Friday.

51:13.445 --> 51:15.739
[sighs] Ben, I'm so sorry.

51:15.822 --> 51:18.200
But you can still go
with Charles and Zenobia on Saturday.

51:18.283 --> 51:20.660
No, I can't,
because they have band competition.

51:20.744 --> 51:23.121
Mandy, this sucks.
What am I supposed to do now?

51:23.205 --> 51:26.124
I can't go to the Olive Garden by myself
on my birthday. That's humiliating.

51:26.208 --> 51:27.584
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

51:28.335 --> 51:30.754
-But Saturday night is it. Okay?
-[Ben scoffs]

51:30.837 --> 51:33.090
Once I talk to the senator,
it'll be back to us.

51:33.173 --> 51:36.718
You kill me in Scattergories while I rant
about billionaires not paying taxes.

51:36.802 --> 51:39.096
Normal times. Promise.

51:40.722 --> 51:41.723
[sighs]

51:45.268 --> 51:46.645
What about LaToya Reynolds?

51:46.728 --> 51:48.563
You said you had a good time
at the movies.

51:48.647 --> 51:51.483
I can't ask LaToya Reynolds
to the Olive Garden on my birthday.

51:51.566 --> 51:52.943
That's worse than shaking her hand.

51:53.026 --> 51:55.153
Trust me,
nothing is worse than shaking her hand.

51:55.862 --> 51:57.656
-LaToya Reynolds!
-Hey.

51:57.739 --> 51:59.241
Ben has a question for you.

51:59.324 --> 52:00.325
[chuckles] Hi.

52:00.826 --> 52:04.121
Yeah. I do have a question for you
that I wanted to ask.

52:04.204 --> 52:05.205
And I-- I guess I'll--

52:05.288 --> 52:08.667
Well, first of all, cool puffy shirt.
I just wanted to say that.

52:08.750 --> 52:10.585
And I also just wanted to say that I am--

52:10.669 --> 52:12.045
My birthday is coming up.

52:12.129 --> 52:15.549
I'm having a birthday,
um, dinner on Saturday.

52:15.632 --> 52:18.844
If you would like to come to that birthday
dinner, you can totally come to it.

52:20.887 --> 52:23.098
-What time?
-Anytime.

52:23.181 --> 52:25.934
-I'm in, Ben Plunkett.
-[Ben chuckles]

52:29.312 --> 52:31.022
-[school bell rings]
-[Mandy chuckles]

52:32.023 --> 52:34.234
-We're going to the Olive Garden!
-And she said yes.

52:34.317 --> 52:35.318
-Okay. Get to class.
-Okay.

52:35.402 --> 52:38.905
BUYFRESHMARKET

52:38.989 --> 52:41.199
-Have a good day, sir.
-Thank you.

52:42.242 --> 52:43.326
-Happy birthday!
-[screams]

52:45.078 --> 52:47.998
-You did not have to get me all this.
-Whoa, selfish.

52:48.081 --> 52:50.125
I am buying this for myself, thank you.

52:51.126 --> 52:53.003
You're getting soda
with single-use plastic?

52:54.337 --> 52:55.755
-Okay, it's all for you.
-[chuckles]

52:55.839 --> 52:58.425
I'm sorry that I'm missing
your birthday dinner tonight.

52:58.925 --> 53:00.552
Is there anything else you want me to get?

53:00.635 --> 53:03.013
Just a Harvard letter
so I can get my best friend back.

53:03.597 --> 53:04.890
[sighs]

53:04.973 --> 53:06.725
Sorry. Cheap shot.

53:06.808 --> 53:08.727
Nah, it's okay. I deserve it.

53:08.810 --> 53:11.563
But it's for the best
that I'm not going tonight.

1:28:12.120 --> 1:28:13.830
Harvard is a no?

1:28:14.414 --> 1:28:15.832
I actually haven't checked,

1:28:15.915 --> 1:28:20.169
but I'm starting to realize there's more
to life than just Harvard, you know?

1:28:20.837 --> 1:28:23.631
What? No! No! I do not know!

1:28:23.715 --> 1:28:26.009
We did not go through hell
for you to give up on Harvard.

1:28:26.092 --> 1:28:27.093

-I don't even know how it happened.

1:29:24.275 --> 1:29:27.320
I mean, I didn't send in
the letter of rec. I swear.

1:29:27.403 --> 1:29:29.238
Well, someone else must have done it.

1:29:30.031 --> 1:29:31.366

1:29:31.449 --> 1:29:32.742
It was me, dummy!

1:29:32.825 --> 1:29:34.619
It was just a boring, unsexy teacher rec.

1:29:34.702 --> 1:29:36.954
And who would know it? It actually worked.

1:29:38.373 --> 1:29:39.665
I don't even know what to say.

1:29:40.333 --> 1:29:42.210
That's all the thanks I need.
Now get out there.

No, really. I can't believe it--

1:29:43.753 --> 1:29:46.089

for once in your life?

[student clears throat]

1:30:35.263 --> 1:30:40.059
Well, today, um,
I was going to give a speech

1:30:40.143 --> 1:30:43.229
filled with words of wisdom from my heroes

1:30:43.312 --> 1:30:47.024
like Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Ingrid Downs.

1:30:50.570 --> 1:30:56.701
But instead, I'd like to share some advice
I got from someone very important to me.

1:30:58.035 --> 1:31:01.414
And that advice is: BEEF.

1:31:12.967 --> 1:31:15.511
-What is she doing?
-I don't know, but I am gonna film it.

1:31:15.595 --> 1:31:19.140
[Mandy] Now, for those of you who are not
sports aficionados like myself,

1:31:19.223 --> 1:31:22.810
BEEF is how you teach someone to shoot a…

1:31:25.521 --> 1:31:26.606
layup?

1:31:26.689 --> 1:31:29.025
-[whispering] No.
-[Mandy] A free throw?

1:31:29.108 --> 1:31:30.485
Free throw. A free throw.

1:31:30.568 --> 1:31:32.069
Um, sorry.

1:31:32.153 --> 1:31:35.448
Uh, it's how you teach someone
to shoot a free throw.

1:31:35.531 --> 1:31:39.285
Uh, but it also applies to life.

1:31:41.078 --> 1:31:42.163
Balance.

1:31:43.289 --> 1:31:44.957
It's something I didn't have enough of.

1:31:46.209 --> 1:31:48.294
You know,
it's-- it's important to have goals,

1:31:48.377 --> 1:31:52.340
but don't let pursuing those goals
become your entire life.

1:31:53.966 --> 1:31:57.345
Work hard but also have fun.

1:31:58.346 --> 1:32:03.851

-Can you believe it's LaToya Reynolds?

At what point will you two stop
referring to me by my full name?

1:34:07.600 --> 1:34:08.893
[Mandy] Probably never.

1:34:13.689 --> 1:34:15.941
Oh. I should go.

you took from that.
