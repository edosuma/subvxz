WEBVTT

00:01.088 --> 00:02.480
GOOD.

00:02.480 --> 00:03.916
YOU'RE 2 INCHES BIGGER
THAN LAST TIME.

00:06.354 --> 00:08.921
BABY'S FACING BACKWARDS.

00:08.921 --> 00:10.706
OH. HERE'S HIS BOTTOM.

00:10.706 --> 00:11.794
SEE?

00:11.794 --> 00:13.317
Charlie: WOW.

00:13.317 --> 00:15.363
THAT'S HIS BUTT?
IT'S KIND OF BONY.

00:15.363 --> 00:17.800
BLOOD PRESSURE'S
JUST A TINY BIT HIGH,

00:17.800 --> 00:19.367
BUT NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

00:19.367 --> 00:20.977
GLUCOSE TEST
CAME BACK NEGATIVE.

00:20.977 --> 00:22.805
YOUR WEIGHT'S
RIGHT ON TARGET.

00:22.805 --> 00:25.242
WHATEVER THAT IS.YOU'RE DOING GREAT, DAPHNE.

00:25.242 --> 00:27.636
EVERYTHING'S
HEALTHY AND NORMAL.

00:27.636 --> 00:29.812
SO WE COULD RELAX
A LITTLE BIT, HUH?

00:29.812 --> 00:32.119
I MEAN, I COULD
HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE
EVERY NOW AND THEN?

00:32.119 --> 00:33.642
OF COURSE.
NO PROBLEM.

00:33.642 --> 00:35.470
AND IT WOULDN'T
ACTUALLY KILL THE BABY

00:35.470 --> 00:37.602
FOR ME TO LEAVE
THE HOUSE, WOULD IT?

00:37.602 --> 00:39.430
NO ONE SAID YOU COULDN'T
LEAVE THE HOUSE.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.389
YOU DID, IF IT WAS
TO SEE A MOVIE.

00:41.389 --> 00:42.825
OH, I REALLY
WOULDN'T WORRY IF--

00:42.825 --> 00:44.000
TO SEE A WAR MOVIE,
SURE, WITH, LIKE,

00:44.000 --> 00:45.871
WALL-TO-WALL BOMBS GOING OFF.

00:45.871 --> 00:47.699
NOT TO MENTION
THE GALLON OF COLA
YOU WOULD'VE HAD.

00:47.699 --> 00:49.745
OH, A GALLON?

00:49.745 --> 00:52.008
WELL, I GUESS YOU WOULD
KNOW, SINCE YOU MEASURE
EVERYTHING I EAT.

00:52.008 --> 00:53.488
GUYS, GUYS!LOOK, IF YOU CARED

00:53.488 --> 00:55.533
WHAT YOU DID
WITH YOURSELF...

00:55.533 --> 00:57.796
OH, AND GUESS WHAT,
MR. LOOK-OUT-FOR-
DEADLY-PRESERVATIVES.

00:57.796 --> 00:59.972
THE BABY IS FINE.

00:59.972 --> 01:01.757
SO FAR,
NO THANKS TO YOU.

01:01.757 --> 01:04.238
Doctor: HEY, HEY.
YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT. REALLY.

01:04.238 --> 01:08.633
JUST TRUST YOURSELVES,
AND TRUST EACH OTHER.

01:08.633 --> 01:11.375
THAT'S NOT SO HARD,
IS IT?

01:13.812 --> 01:16.641
THIS MIRROR
IS THE FIRST THING
COMING DOWN

01:16.641 --> 01:18.252
IF WE TAKE THIS PLACE.

01:18.252 --> 01:21.168
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU'RE THINKING US HERE?

01:21.168 --> 01:22.995
WELL, LOOK AROUND,
SARAH.

01:22.995 --> 01:24.606
THIS PLACE IS PHAT.

01:24.606 --> 01:25.998
AND IT'S AVAILABLE NOW.

01:25.998 --> 01:28.523
PHAT.
BAILEY, I CAN'T AFFORD IT.

01:28.523 --> 01:31.917
I MEAN, ONE MONTH'S RENT IS,
LIKE, WHAT, A YEAR'S TUITION
AT BERKELEY?

01:31.917 --> 01:33.745
THAT'S OK.
I'LL PAY FOR IT.

01:33.745 --> 01:35.921
I--I DON'T KNOW
HOW I FEEL ABOUT THAT.

01:35.921 --> 01:38.620
WELL, WHAT'S
THE DIFFERENCE IF I'D BE
PAYING FOR IT ANYWAY?

01:38.620 --> 01:40.535
BAILEY, CAN YOU
BE ANY MORE FIFTIES?

01:40.535 --> 01:42.841
YOU KNOW, "DON'T WORRY
YOUR PRETTY HEAD
ABOUT IT, TOOTS.

01:42.841 --> 01:44.234
MR. MONEYPANTS IS HERE."

01:44.234 --> 01:46.454
NO, THAT'S NOT--
LISTEN.

01:46.454 --> 01:47.846
THINGS ARE
GOING REALLY WELL

01:47.846 --> 01:49.935
AT THE RESTAURANT
RIGHT NOW,

01:49.935 --> 01:54.462
SO MAYBE I WANT TO SPEND
MY MONEY ON SOMETHING
THAT I CAN SHARE...

01:54.462 --> 01:55.898
WITH YOU...

01:55.898 --> 01:58.509
YOU KNOW,
THE GIRL I LOVE.

02:00.685 --> 02:02.861
OK.

02:02.861 --> 02:05.734
OK, I GUESS, AS LONG
AS YOU LET ME TAKE ON
SOME OF THE EXPENSES,

02:05.734 --> 02:08.345
YOU KNOW,
THE ONES I CAN AFFORD.

02:08.345 --> 02:10.217
GREAT.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.436
AH, THIS
IS SO GREAT.

02:12.436 --> 02:14.221
LOOK AT THIS.

02:14.221 --> 02:17.354
HEY. IS THIS PLACE
NOT PERFECT FOR MY
BIRTHDAY PARTY?

02:17.354 --> 02:19.878
IF WE, LIKE, IF WE
CLEARED OUT A SPACE
OVER THERE

02:19.878 --> 02:21.271
FOR A DANCE FLOOR?

02:21.271 --> 02:23.099
YOU KNOW, BAILEY, UM,
IF THE MIRRORS

02:23.099 --> 02:25.928
ARE REALLY GONNA BE
THE FIRST THING TO GO,

02:25.928 --> 02:28.017
DON'T YOU THINK WE SHOULD
EXPERIENCE THEM FIRST,

02:28.017 --> 02:28.931
ONCE OR TWICE?

02:32.674 --> 02:35.242
THE REALTOR'S
GONNA BE BACK
IN 20 MINUTES.

02:35.242 --> 02:37.505
COME HERE, SUGAR DADDY,
WHILE YOU'RE YOUNG.

02:39.333 --> 02:40.638
HEY.

02:42.814 --> 02:45.469

03:49.794 --> 03:51.622
I'M GONNA
GO TAKE A NAP.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.453
YOU LOOK DIFFERENT.

03:56.453 --> 03:58.238
YOU GOT NEW JEANS
OR SOMETHING.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.936
UH, NO, I JUST--
I WASHED 'EM. HEH.

04:00.936 --> 04:03.330
OH. RIGHT.

04:03.330 --> 04:04.896
RIGHT.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.378
IS THIS ALL YOU'RE TAKING?

04:08.378 --> 04:10.772
OH. YEAH. YOU KNOW,
I DON'T WANT TO

04:10.772 --> 04:12.904
WEIGH MYSELF DOWN
WITH TOO MUCH STUFF.

04:15.167 --> 04:17.126
YOU KNOW, YOU FORGOT--
FORGOT, UH...

04:18.780 --> 04:19.998
YOU GOT YOUR RING ON.

04:21.696 --> 04:23.915
OH, WOW.

04:27.658 --> 04:30.052
SO WHEN AM I

OH, I DON'T KNOW.

04:33.011 --> 04:35.797
UH, YOU GONNA

05:37.815 --> 05:39.861
SALINGER. JULIA.

05:39.861 --> 05:42.385
EPIC FRAME

05:42.385 --> 05:44.387
I'M SORRY.

06:02.971 --> 06:04.407
WAIT!

06:04.407 --> 06:05.887
SALINGER, IS IT?

06:07.454 --> 06:09.412

06:11.458 --> 06:12.763
UH, LISTEN,

06:12.763 --> 06:14.374

06:16.245 --> 06:18.073
OH, YOU MEAN
ROOMMATE PERSON.

06:18.073 --> 06:19.509
COOL. HI.

06:19.509 --> 06:21.381
HI.I'M MAGGIE.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

NICE TO SEE--

06:22.730 --> 06:24.732
UH, I MEAN,
UH, MEET YOU.

06:26.298 --> 06:27.822
MAYBE
I SHOULD JUST--

06:27.822 --> 06:29.911
OH, WHY,
'CAUSE WE'RE NAKED?

06:29.911 --> 06:31.913
OH, COME ON, IF WE'RE
ALL GONNA BE LIVING TOGETHER,

06:31.913 --> 06:34.916
WE MAY AS WELL
GET USED TO IT, RIGHT?

06:34.916 --> 06:37.440
I'M SORRY,
YOU SAID ALL OF US,
TOGETHER?

06:37.440 --> 06:39.921
OH. WELL, SEE,

06:39.921 --> 06:42.358
BUT HIS ROOMMATE'S
ALL, LIKE, BORN AGAIN,

06:42.358 --> 06:45.274
SO, YOU KNOW,
WE COULD NEVER DO IT THERE.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.887
LEANNE.

06:49.887 --> 06:52.324
LEANNE, 6 IS SITTING
ON A CHECK.

06:52.324 --> 06:54.414
WE GOT 20 PEOPLE
WAITING FOR TABLES.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.981
HEY. I KNOW.BUENOS TARDES, HERMANO.

06:56.981 --> 06:58.287
I GOT HELD UP.
I'M SORRY.

06:58.287 --> 06:59.680
WHAT, COULDN'T
GET TO A PHONE?

06:59.680 --> 07:01.421
HEY, YOU DON'T EVEN--NEVER MIND.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.031
JUST TELL ME WHAT'S
WITH THESE PANELS.

07:03.031 --> 07:04.336
WHY AREN'T
THE FIXTURES IN?

07:05.425 --> 07:07.122
I GOTTA RESTAIN THE WOOD.

07:07.122 --> 07:08.993
THEY CAME FINISHED IN MATTE.
TOTAL MISMATCH.

07:08.993 --> 07:10.430
THE FINISH?

07:10.430 --> 07:12.519
WHAT, THEY'RE
NOT SHINY ENOUGH?

07:12.519 --> 07:14.564
CHARLIE, WE DON'T
HAVE TIME TO DEAL
WITH THIS, MAN.

07:14.564 --> 07:17.654
DO YOU REALIZE
WHAT I HAVE TO DO
JUST TODAY ALONE?

07:17.654 --> 07:20.657
THE HEALTH GUY IS
DOING A SPOT CHECK
IN 40 MINUTES.

07:20.657 --> 07:22.050
WHICH REMINDS ME,
I'VE GOTTA PUSH OFF

07:22.050 --> 07:23.530
THAT LIFE-INSURANCE
PHYSICAL AGAIN.

07:23.530 --> 07:25.619
AND THEN, AFTER THAT,
THE MERCHANT ASSOCIATION

07:25.619 --> 07:28.535
WANTS A PLANNING SESSION
BECAUSE I WENT
TEMPORARILY INSANE.

07:28.535 --> 07:30.667
AND YOU CAN
STOP SMILING,

07:30.667 --> 07:33.061
OR YOU CAN
GO TO THE DOCTOR
AND SPREAD 'EM.

07:33.061 --> 07:35.324
YOU SOUND LIKE
SOME OLD GUY HERE,

07:35.324 --> 07:38.283
LIKE YOU'RE ABOUT
TO START GROUSING ABOUT
YOUR PENSION OR SOMETHING.

07:38.283 --> 07:41.983
WHICH IS KIND OF FUNNY,
'CAUSE, I MEAN, HAVE YOU
SEEN THAT...

07:41.983 --> 07:44.464
CHROME PEEKING
THROUGH YOUR DOME UP THERE?

07:44.464 --> 07:45.856
CHROME? MY DOME...

07:45.856 --> 07:48.468
MY--WHAT, MY--MY HAIR?

07:48.468 --> 07:50.600
YEAH. MAYBE IT'S
JUST THE LIGHT,

07:50.600 --> 07:52.384
BUT IT'S
DEFINITELY LOOKIN'...

07:52.384 --> 07:54.343
A LITTLE THIN UP THERE.

07:54.343 --> 07:56.127
WHERE'S A...

07:59.566 --> 08:02.133
SO I WAS THINKING,
HUMAN SEXUALITY,

08:02.133 --> 08:03.961
THAT'S JUST
REPRODUCTIVE BIO.
I'VE DONE THAT.

08:03.961 --> 08:06.486
WHAT ABOUT...RIGHT HERE?NO, IT'S FINE.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.053
IT'S JUST KIND OF
GROWING IN A SWIRL.

08:09.053 --> 08:11.578
ANYWAY,
THE PROFESSOR KNOWS THAT
WE ALL FEEL THIS WAY,

08:11.578 --> 08:13.797
SO RIGHT OFF THE BAT,
IT'S THE TABOO STUFF,

08:13.797 --> 08:15.495
LIKE, "HERE'S 20 WAYS
WHY MEN AND WOMEN ARE
NOT CREATED EQUAL."

08:15.495 --> 08:16.844
CHECK THE FRONT.

08:16.844 --> 08:18.672
H-HOW ABOUT THE FRONT?
CHECK THE FRONT.

08:18.672 --> 08:19.673
AND DID YOU KNOW--

08:19.673 --> 08:20.674
HEY, WAIT.

08:20.674 --> 08:22.197
IS THAT...

08:22.197 --> 08:25.766
GRAY! IS THAT--
IS THIS GRAY HAIR?

08:25.766 --> 08:27.637
NO, BAILEY. IT'S BLOND.
ANYWAY...

08:27.637 --> 08:29.639
SO, THEY WERE SAYING,
FOR INSTANCE,

08:29.639 --> 08:32.816
THAT A WOMAN'S
SEXUAL PRIME IS AT 35,
BUT A MAN'S--

08:32.816 --> 08:35.602
WELL, GUESS
WHEN YOURS IS.

08:35.602 --> 08:37.647
I DON'T KNOW.

08:37.647 --> 08:39.127
39?

08:39.127 --> 08:40.520
THEN, WHAT?

08:40.520 --> 08:41.521
30?

08:42.739 --> 08:45.002
25?

08:45.002 --> 08:46.047
21?

08:47.483 --> 08:49.006
LESS THAN 20?

08:49.006 --> 08:50.791
19.

08:50.791 --> 08:52.444
WHAT?

08:54.316 --> 08:56.753
WHAT--AND THEN
WHAT DOES IT DO,

08:56.753 --> 08:59.408
LIKE, LEVEL OFF
FOR A COUPLE DECADES OR...

08:59.408 --> 09:01.845
WAIT. WHEN WAS
THIS THING PUBLISHED?

09:01.845 --> 09:04.544
BECAUSE THEY'RE UPDATING
THESE THINGS ALL THE TIME.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.721
IT'S FOR YOU.

09:07.721 --> 09:09.244
MM.

09:09.244 --> 09:10.245
[LAUGHS]

09:10.245 --> 09:12.421
HELLO?

09:12.421 --> 09:13.335
UH-HUH.

09:14.815 --> 09:16.251
MY BROTHER TOOK IT.

09:16.251 --> 09:17.557
OH, GET HIS NAME.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.254
WE'LL SEE
WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE.

09:19.254 --> 09:22.344
YEAH, GREAT LIGHTING.
THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE SAYS.

09:22.344 --> 09:24.476
UH-HUH.

09:24.476 --> 09:26.522
UH-HUH.

09:26.522 --> 09:29.046
UH-HUH.

09:29.046 --> 09:31.135
UH-HUH.
OH, HE'S CUTE.

09:31.135 --> 09:32.963
UH, UH, LISTEN,
UM, STEVE,

09:32.963 --> 09:36.227
TO BE HONEST--
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU SOUND REALLY NICE,

09:36.227 --> 09:38.839
BUT I DON'T THINK
I'M GONNA BE INTERESTED,

09:38.839 --> 09:42.146
SO, UH, THANK YOU,
BUT, UM, SORRY. BYE.

09:42.146 --> 09:44.584
WHAT? I THOUGHT
HE WAS PRETTY CUTE.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.151
HE WANTED TO SHOW ME
HIS LIZARD COLLECTION.

09:47.151 --> 09:50.154
HE HAS A KOMODO DRAGON
OVER 3 FEET LONG.

09:50.154 --> 09:52.026
OOH. SUCH A GOOD CALL.

09:52.026 --> 09:53.244
OHH!

09:53.244 --> 09:55.595
ANYONE HERE
NAMED LISA?

09:56.813 --> 09:58.728
LISA?

09:58.728 --> 10:02.123
THAT'S YOUR NAME,
ISN'T IT?

10:02.123 --> 10:03.907
ISN'T THAT
THE NAME THAT YOU GAVE

10:03.907 --> 10:06.344
WHEN YOU RECENTLY
ORDERED, YOU KNOW,
THE FOOD?

10:06.344 --> 10:08.172
NO.

10:08.172 --> 10:10.131
OH. HEH. SORRY.

10:10.131 --> 10:12.612
BRAND-NEW ROOMMATES.
STILL A LITTLE RUSTY
ON THE NAMES.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.743
BUT THANK YOU.

10:13.743 --> 10:15.092
OH. HEH.

10:16.659 --> 10:17.617
BYE.

10:19.836 --> 10:23.797
OK, I KNOW I'VE
BEEN OUT OF THE MARKET
FOR A WHILE,

10:23.797 --> 10:25.625
BUT HE SEEMED SO CUTE.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.931
I--I MEAN,
SO IS THERE...

10:27.931 --> 10:31.413
I DON'T KNOW, IS THERE,
LIKE, A GUY BACK HOME
OR SOMETHING?

10:31.413 --> 10:34.329
OH. I--I SHOULD
SHUT UP AND MIND
MY BUSINESS, RIGHT?

10:34.329 --> 10:35.635
NO.

10:35.635 --> 10:36.636
NO, IT'S OK.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.725
IT'S JUST...

10:38.725 --> 10:39.639
I'M JUST...

10:41.902 --> 10:44.687
I'M JUST HERE TO WORK.
THAT'S ALL.

10:44.687 --> 10:47.037
I'M HERE TO WORK.

10:47.037 --> 10:49.344
ARE YOU ACTUALLY TAKING
THAT MANY PICTURES?

10:49.344 --> 10:51.825
WELL, I HAVE TO REMEMBER
WHAT EVERYBODY
LOOKS LIKE,

10:51.825 --> 10:55.611
AND I DEFINITELY DON'T
WANT TO TRUST A SHIPPER
NOT TO BREAK THEM.

10:55.611 --> 10:58.527
SHE STILL NOT BACK?

10:58.527 --> 10:59.528
MM-MMM.

11:01.704 --> 11:02.618
YEAH, I AM.

11:04.446 --> 11:07.667
I WAS IN THE KITCHEN
GETTING SOME FOOD.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.670
YOU CAME IN
THE BACK?

11:10.670 --> 11:12.280
WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY SOMETHING?

11:12.280 --> 11:13.716
I WAS HUNGRY.

11:13.716 --> 11:14.630
OH.

11:16.588 --> 11:18.895
SO, UM...

11:18.895 --> 11:19.896
WHERE'D YOU GO?

11:19.896 --> 11:21.768
WE HUNG OUT AT DUSTY'S.

11:21.768 --> 11:24.684
HER BAND CAME OVER AND
TRIED OUT A COUPLE NEW SONGS.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.120
HUH.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.035
THAT MUST BE FUN,

11:28.035 --> 11:31.865
HANGING OUT
IN SOME SMOKY GARAGE,
ROCKIN' OUT.

11:31.865 --> 11:34.128
I GUESS.SO, UH...

11:34.128 --> 11:36.260
THEY PRACTICE
WITH AMPS?

11:38.306 --> 11:39.307
I DON'T KNOW.

11:39.307 --> 11:40.569
SOMETIMES. WHY?

11:41.309 --> 11:43.267
NO REASON.

11:43.267 --> 11:45.008
JUST, THAT KIND
OF STUFF MUST DRIVE
THE NEIGHBORS CRAZY.

11:45.008 --> 11:47.010
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST SAY IT, OK?

11:47.010 --> 11:49.621
LOUD MUSIC AND SMOKE--
IT'S BAD FOR THE BABY,
RIGHT?

11:49.621 --> 11:51.188
ISN'T THAT
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

11:51.188 --> 11:53.234
NO. I DIDN'T.
I'M JUST...

11:53.234 --> 11:55.105
I'M JUST CURIOUS,
IS ALL.

11:55.105 --> 11:55.976
[SIGHS]

11:58.282 --> 11:59.283
OHH...

12:11.382 --> 12:12.949
[SIGHS] DAPHNE,
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

12:12.949 --> 12:14.908
I CAN'T...

12:14.908 --> 12:16.518
I CAN'T ASK
ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS?

12:16.518 --> 12:18.041
WHY WOULD YOU?

12:18.041 --> 12:20.914
YOU THINK THEY'RE
A BUNCH OF LOSERS.

12:20.914 --> 12:22.480
DAPHNE, COME ON.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.831
WE'RE...

12:24.831 --> 12:25.962
WE'RE LIVING
TOGETHER HERE.

12:25.962 --> 12:27.442
I MEAN, WE'RE...

12:27.442 --> 12:28.748
WE'RE TOGETHER,
AREN'T WE?

12:28.748 --> 12:30.488
I DON'T KNOW.
ARE WE?

12:31.838 --> 12:33.796
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

12:33.796 --> 12:35.537
IT MEANS...

12:38.801 --> 12:41.804
DO YOU KNOW WHY
I SAID YES TO YOU, CHARLIE,

12:41.804 --> 12:43.893
WHEN YOU ASKED ME
TO HAVE THIS BABY?

12:43.893 --> 12:45.199
IT WAS YOU.

12:45.199 --> 12:47.157
THERE WAS THIS LOOK
IN YOUR EYE.

12:47.157 --> 12:48.985
IT WAS HOW BADLY
YOU WANTED IT,

12:48.985 --> 12:52.075
AND IT WAS HOW BADLY
I WANTED TO GIVE IT TO YOU.

12:52.075 --> 12:55.035
I MEAN, WE USED TO HAVE
SO MUCH FUN, CHARLIE.

12:55.035 --> 12:58.081
YOU WERE THIS HOT,
EASYGOING GUY,

12:58.081 --> 13:00.475
AND I DON'T...

13:02.564 --> 13:06.089
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS EXPECTING THIS
TO BE LIKE.

13:06.089 --> 13:08.396
I KNEW IT WASN'T
GONNA BE EASY.

13:10.964 --> 13:13.575
BUT THIS MORNING
WHEN I TRIED TO...

13:13.575 --> 13:15.229
REMEMBER HOW I GOT HERE,

13:15.229 --> 13:17.492
I COULDN'T.

13:17.492 --> 13:20.930
BECAUSE ALL THOSE REASONS
THAT MADE ME WANT TO SAY YES...

13:23.280 --> 13:25.152
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THEY WENT.

13:34.030 --> 13:34.901
I'M GONNA, UM...

13:37.860 --> 13:38.774
[SIGHS]

13:41.559 --> 13:43.692
I'M GONNA SLEEP
DOWNSTAIRS TONIGHT.

14:08.935 --> 14:10.893
IS THIS HOW YOU
PICTURED THIS PLACE,

14:10.893 --> 14:14.549
YOU KNOW, THIS QUAD,
THESE PEOPLE'S...

14:14.549 --> 14:17.639
EVERYBODY
BEING A COUPLE?

14:17.639 --> 14:19.728
WELL, I KIND OF
THOUGHT THERE'D BE
MORE BELL-BOTTOMS,

14:19.728 --> 14:21.861
BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.906
'CAUSE ME,

14:23.906 --> 14:26.300
I HAD, LIKE, THIS
VIVID MENTAL PICTURE

14:26.300 --> 14:28.084
OF EVERY PERSON HERE,

14:28.084 --> 14:31.827
AND--AND I HAD
THIS MENTAL PICTURE
OF ME WITH THEM.

14:31.827 --> 14:34.221
BUT PLATONICALLY.

14:34.221 --> 14:36.179
WELL, OF COURSE, YEAH.

14:36.179 --> 14:38.660
BUT...NOW...

14:38.660 --> 14:42.055
NOW I LOOK AROUND,
AND NOBODY'S WHO
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE.

14:42.055 --> 14:44.579
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?
ARE YOU STILL YOU?

14:47.582 --> 14:49.018
WELL, THAT'S THE THING.

14:49.018 --> 14:52.021
I'M--I'M NOT SURE.
YOU KNOW?

14:52.021 --> 14:54.110
I MEAN, I STILL
SORT OF KNOW WHAT
I WANT TO DO HERE,

14:54.110 --> 14:57.244
WITH MY WORK AND
THE EXTRACURRICULARS
AND WHATEVER,

14:57.244 --> 14:58.680
BUT...

14:58.680 --> 15:01.335
HOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN
AND WITH WHO...

15:03.250 --> 15:05.034
I DON'T KNOW.

15:05.034 --> 15:07.036
I THOUGHT I KNEW,
YOU KNOW?

15:07.036 --> 15:08.472
BUT I--I DON'T.

15:08.472 --> 15:09.909
I--I HAVE NO CLUE.

15:11.475 --> 15:13.129
WELL, LOOK...

15:13.129 --> 15:15.479
NED AND I
ARE HEADING FOR COFFEE.

15:17.525 --> 15:20.658
WHY DON'T YOU BLOW OFF
THE COURSE CATALOG AND COME?

15:20.658 --> 15:21.529
OH.

15:21.529 --> 15:22.530
UH...

15:22.530 --> 15:23.966
HEH. NO.

15:23.966 --> 15:24.967
THANKS.

15:24.967 --> 15:26.316
UM, I HAVE TO REDO

15:26.316 --> 15:27.927
THIS PATHETIC
CREATIVE WRITING SAMPLE,

15:27.927 --> 15:30.364
MAKE IT MORE,
YOU KNOW, NOT PATHETIC.

15:30.364 --> 15:32.714
BUT I'LL--I'LL
SEE YOU AT THE FRESHMAN
MIXER THING LATER.

15:47.642 --> 15:48.904
HEY.
HMM.

15:48.904 --> 15:50.210
GOOD MORNING.

15:50.210 --> 15:52.473
COME ON. SIT.

15:52.473 --> 15:54.170
SIT, SIT, SIT,

15:54.170 --> 15:55.563
AND EAT.

15:55.563 --> 15:58.044
WAIT. BACON.

15:58.044 --> 15:59.523
ISN'T THAT,
LIKE, NITRATES
OR SOMETHING?

15:59.523 --> 16:01.699
HEY, MY MOM
RAISED ME ON THIS JUNK.

16:01.699 --> 16:03.527
IT'S NOT GONNA KILL
OUR BABY, EITHER, RIGHT?

16:03.527 --> 16:05.965
GO ON, EAT. CHOW DOWN.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.879
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU?

16:07.879 --> 16:08.880
NOTHING.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.534
I'M COMPLETELY MYSELF.

16:10.534 --> 16:12.928
I AM...THE ME
THAT I USED TO BE,

16:12.928 --> 16:15.539
THE ME THAT I SHOULD
HAVE NEVER STOPPED BEING.

16:15.539 --> 16:17.759
CHARLIE, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THIS.

16:17.759 --> 16:19.413
I'M NOT TRYING
TO MAKE YOU--

16:19.413 --> 16:21.023
NO. I KNOW. I KNOW.

16:21.023 --> 16:24.766
BUT, UM, LAST NIGHT,
WHEN YOU LEFT...

16:24.766 --> 16:27.856
I COULDN'T SLEEP,
SO INSTEAD OF COUNTING SHEEP,

16:27.856 --> 16:30.598
I COUNTED THE TIMES
WE PLAYED AIR PUCK.

16:30.598 --> 16:32.948
IT WAS, UM, IT WAS 6.

16:32.948 --> 16:37.300
YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES
WE'VE PLAYED AIR PUCK
SINCE YOU GOT PREGNANT?

16:37.300 --> 16:39.737
ZERO. ZIP.

16:39.737 --> 16:42.131
I MEAN, THAT--
THAT'S NOT RIGHT, DAPHNE.

16:42.131 --> 16:44.090
YOU'RE REALLY GOOD
AT AIR PUCK.

16:44.090 --> 16:45.787
THANKS.

16:45.787 --> 16:48.050
SO, OBVIOUSLY,
SOMETHING HAS TO GIVE.

16:48.050 --> 16:51.619
I MEAN, WE HAVE TO TAKE
A VACATION FROM THIS WHOLE--
THIS WHOLE PARENT THING,

16:51.619 --> 16:52.620
LIKE...

16:52.620 --> 16:54.187
STARTING TODAY.

16:54.187 --> 16:55.927
TODAY?

16:55.927 --> 16:59.018
I CALLED AND CANCELED
THE HOSPITAL TOUR THAT WE HAD,

16:59.018 --> 17:02.586
SO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO,
THE DAY IS WIDE OPEN.

17:04.327 --> 17:05.763
WOW, CHARLIE.

17:08.810 --> 17:13.510
UM, BUT, I MEAN,
I KIND OF ALREADY
MADE PLANS FOR TODAY.

17:15.208 --> 17:18.037
YOU DID?
BUT HOW'D YOU--

17:18.037 --> 17:21.344
I MEAN, DIDN'T YOU KNOW
WE HAD THE HOSPITAL THING?

17:21.344 --> 17:23.912
OH, I KNOW YOU DID,
BUT I WASN'T PLANNING
ON GOING.

17:23.912 --> 17:26.088
YOU'RE THE MOM HERE.
WHAT'S THE POINT OF ME GOING--

17:26.088 --> 17:29.048
BUT, I MEAN, WHY SHOULD
I GO IF I'M JUST GONNA
GO IN THERE,

17:29.048 --> 17:30.701
HAVE THE BABY,
AND THEN LEAVE?

17:30.701 --> 17:32.094
I MEAN, HOSPITALS...

17:32.094 --> 17:35.184
RIGHT. NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S OK.

17:35.184 --> 17:39.188
BUT YOU COULD COME
WITH ME TO THIS THING
IF YOU WANTED TO.

17:39.188 --> 17:41.625
I MEAN, IT'S JUST
A BUNCH OF STRIPPERS.

17:41.625 --> 17:43.671
OR I COULD BAG IT.

17:43.671 --> 17:44.802
NO. NO.

17:44.802 --> 17:46.282
NO. YOU SHOULD GO.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.676
YOU SHOULD GO.
THAT'S, UM...

17:48.676 --> 17:51.809
THAT WAS THE POINT
OF THIS, ANYWAY.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.688
LOOK AT THE MONKEY.

18:00.688 --> 18:02.168
SAY AHH.

18:02.168 --> 18:03.604
AHHHH...

18:03.604 --> 18:06.302
BAILEY, I THINK
WE NEED TO TALK.

18:06.302 --> 18:08.870
AM I GONNA FLUNK
FOR MY INSURANCE THINGY?

18:08.870 --> 18:11.699
OH, NO, NO, I THINK
YOU'LL BE FINE.

18:11.699 --> 18:13.875
THEN IS IT MY TONSILS,
DR. BOB?

18:13.875 --> 18:15.703
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY TONSILS, FELLA.

18:15.703 --> 18:17.226
WE TOOK 'EM OUT
WHEN YOU WERE 8.

18:17.226 --> 18:18.706
[KNOCK ON DOOR]DOCTOR?

18:18.706 --> 18:20.360
ANNABELLE'S SCARED
TO HAVE A SHOTTER.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.536
SHE WON'T COME OUT
OF THE POO-POO ROOM.

18:22.536 --> 18:23.667
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

18:23.667 --> 18:24.712
SO THEN WHAT IS IT?

18:24.712 --> 18:26.540
DID I BLOW THE HEARING TEST?

18:26.540 --> 18:28.585
'CAUSE I MISSED A COUPLE
OF CHICKADEE-DEES,

18:28.585 --> 18:30.761
BUT COME ON,
THE WAY THOSE KIDS
WERE SCREAMING OUT THERE?

18:30.761 --> 18:32.633
NO, IT'S NOT THAT.

18:32.633 --> 18:35.679
YOU JUST HAVE
A 10% LOSS IN YOUR
LEFT UPPER REGISTER.

18:35.679 --> 18:37.290
10%?

18:37.290 --> 18:38.682
I'VE LOST 10%?

18:38.682 --> 18:41.729
IT'S NOTHING, REALLY.
HMM.

18:41.729 --> 18:43.861
"HMM"? WHAT IS--
WHAT "HMM"?

18:43.861 --> 18:47.561
BLOOD PRESSURE'S
A LITTLE HIGH
FOR SOMEONE YOUR AGE.

18:47.561 --> 18:48.997
WELL--
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

18:48.997 --> 18:50.303
NO BIG DEAL.

18:50.303 --> 18:51.869
JUST SOMETHING
TO KEEP AN EYE ON.

18:51.869 --> 18:53.697
WELL, SO THEN WHAT'S
THE PROBLEM, DR. BOB?

18:53.697 --> 18:55.873
YOU'RE GIVING ME
THE WILLIES HERE.

18:55.873 --> 18:57.571
I'VE BEEN YOUR DOCTOR
FOR 20 YEARS, BAILEY.

18:57.571 --> 18:59.181
THAT'S A VERY LONG TIME.

18:59.181 --> 19:01.923
NUH-UH. IT'S NOT--
IT'S NOT THAT LONG.

19:01.923 --> 19:05.318
I THINK IT'S TIME
YOU GOT YOURSELF
A GROWN-UP DOCTOR,

19:05.318 --> 19:07.320
A REGULAR G.P.,

19:07.320 --> 19:11.672
SOMEONE WHO DEALS
MORE WITH THE ISSUES
A MAN YOUR AGE CAN FACE.

19:11.672 --> 19:12.803
MY AGE?

19:12.803 --> 19:14.544
BUT...

19:14.544 --> 19:16.155
WHAT IF I DON'T WANT TO?

19:16.155 --> 19:18.418
WHAT IF I LIKE YOU,
DR. BOB?

19:20.811 --> 19:21.769
HAVE A LOLLY.

19:23.249 --> 19:24.598
YOU'LL BE FINE.

19:29.864 --> 19:31.996
HI. UM, CAN I BUY
SOME CHANGE OFF YOU
FOR MY METER?

19:31.996 --> 19:34.042
NO PROBLEM.

19:34.042 --> 19:36.610
I'M KIND OF DESPERATE.
I'M RUNNING A LITTLE LATE.
THANKS.

19:36.610 --> 19:38.351
Daphne:
HE'S, LIKE, SO MAD.

19:38.351 --> 19:40.918
HE'S, LIKE,
RED IN THE FACE,
AND THEN HE GOES,

19:40.918 --> 19:43.312
"LADY, I'M GONNA HAVE
TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE!

19:43.312 --> 19:44.922
AND YOUR SHIRT,
AND YOUR BRA..."

19:44.922 --> 19:46.402
HERE'S YOUR CHANGE.
HERE YOU GO.

19:46.402 --> 19:47.664
OH, THANKS. THANKS.
BYE-BYE.

19:47.664 --> 19:49.362
"THEY'RE NOT
WELCOME EITHER,"

19:49.362 --> 19:50.754
AND I WAS, LIKE, "OH, MY GOD,
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?!"

19:50.754 --> 19:52.713
WHEN ARE THE SPEECHES?

19:52.713 --> 19:55.019
I WROTE THIS
WHOLE STUPID LIMERICK
'CAUSE YOU SAID--

19:55.019 --> 19:56.456
I--HEY.

19:56.456 --> 19:58.893
SHOULD WE GET STARTED
WITH DESSERT?

19:58.893 --> 20:00.416
YEAH. NO PROBLEM.
SHE'LL BE HERE.

20:00.416 --> 20:01.983
SHE'S PROBABLY
JUST TRYING TO PARK.

20:01.983 --> 20:03.637
I DIDN'T SEE
ANY SPACES
FOR MILES.

20:03.637 --> 20:05.247
IT'S AN APPLET
THAT TAKES YOU

20:05.247 --> 20:08.250
STRAIGHT TO OUR WEB PAGE
AS SOON AS YOU LOG ON.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.860
WE HAVE A WEB PAGE?

20:09.860 --> 20:12.036
YEAH. I--I JUST
GOT IT DONE.

20:12.036 --> 20:14.865
YOU CLICK ON THE VIOLIN
FOR YOUR BOX

20:14.865 --> 20:16.954
AND THE, UH, LECTERN
FOR MINE.

20:16.954 --> 20:19.000
YOU KNOW,
JUST TO STAY IN TOUCH.

20:20.784 --> 20:22.960
I REALLY NEED
FOR YOU TO READ THIS,

20:22.960 --> 20:24.788
BECAUSE I HAVE
THIS NAGGING FEELING
THAT IT SUCKS.

20:24.788 --> 20:26.703
SORRY I'M LATE.

20:26.703 --> 20:29.271
IT TOOK ME LONGER
TO PARK THAN IT DID
TO DRIVE HERE.

20:29.271 --> 20:31.055
AH, I KNOW.
I MEAN, I WONDER
IF DAPHNE'S OK.

20:31.055 --> 20:33.971
IT'S NOT LIKE
SHE CAN PARK
AND THEN WALK 20 BLOCKS.

20:33.971 --> 20:35.538
MAYBE I SHOULD
GO CHECK IT OUT.

20:35.538 --> 20:37.932
NO, SHE'S OK.
I MEAN, UM...

20:37.932 --> 20:39.760
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.327
I MEAN,
I SAW HER.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.372
YOU SAW HER? WHERE?

20:43.372 --> 20:44.678
UH...

20:44.678 --> 20:46.723
SO, WHAT WAS
THE FIRST DAY LIKE?

20:46.723 --> 20:48.986
I MEAN, WAS IT
DIFFERENT, YOU KNOW,
LIKE YOU THOUGHT,

20:48.986 --> 20:50.553
OR WAS IT--
WAS IT REALLY CREEPY?

20:50.553 --> 20:52.033
IT WAS FINE.

20:52.033 --> 20:53.817
IN FACT, THERE'S
A PARTY THING TONIGHT,

20:53.817 --> 20:56.690
THIS, UH, FRESHMAN
GET-TO-KNOW-EACH-OTHER THING,

20:56.690 --> 20:58.257
WITH A BAND AND DANCING.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.432
WOW.
YEAH.

20:59.432 --> 21:00.389
IT SOUNDS GREAT.

21:01.651 --> 21:03.044
I MEAN, I...

21:03.044 --> 21:05.655
I SORT OF HAD
THIS FANTASY OF US...

21:05.655 --> 21:07.831
I DON'T KNOW, SPENDING
MY LAST NIGHT HERE

21:07.831 --> 21:10.051
TOGETHER
IN OUR OLD ROOM, BUT...

21:10.051 --> 21:12.619
FORGET IT, CLAUD.
FORGET THE PARTY.
I'D MUCH RATHER BE WITH YOU.

21:12.619 --> 21:13.837
MUCH.
REALLY?

21:13.837 --> 21:15.317
YEAH.

21:15.317 --> 21:16.840
HI. CLAUDIA,
I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

21:16.840 --> 21:17.841
HI. THAT'S OK.

21:17.841 --> 21:19.060
I'M SUCH A SPACE.

21:19.060 --> 21:20.496
WELL, YOU'RE
IN A GOOD MOOD.

21:20.496 --> 21:22.498
COME HERE
FOR A SECOND.

21:22.498 --> 21:24.326
SO WHAT'D I MISS?
PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING,
HUH? I GUESS.

21:24.326 --> 21:25.980
WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

21:25.980 --> 21:28.243
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

21:28.243 --> 21:31.202
CLAUD'S LAST NIGHT
IN THE CITY, AND YOU
MISS THE WHOLE THING?

21:31.202 --> 21:33.770
CLAUDIA, ARE THERE
SOME MORE PRESENTS
YOU NEED TO OPEN?

21:33.770 --> 21:35.816
I'M SORRY.
I'M SAID I'M SORRY.

21:35.816 --> 21:37.165
WHAT--WHAT IS GOING
THROUGH YOUR HEAD?

21:37.165 --> 21:38.558
I MEAN, WHAT ARE
YOU THINKING ABOUT?

21:38.558 --> 21:40.386
I JUST LOST TRACK
OF TIME, OK?

21:40.386 --> 21:42.518
I WAS HAVING FUN,
FOR, LIKE, THE FIRST
TIME IN MONTHS!

21:42.518 --> 21:44.259
IT'S NOT JUST
THE TIME, DAPHNE.

21:44.259 --> 21:46.479
ALL RIGHT, 90 MINUTES LATE
BECAUSE YOU WERE DRINKING?

21:46.479 --> 21:48.655
WHAT?
WHO ARE YOU--UHH--

21:48.655 --> 21:51.875
I HAD A LITTLE WINE, OK?
A LITTLE WINE.

21:51.875 --> 21:54.487
AND WHO'S TO SAY
I CAN'T DRINK
IN MODERATION?

21:54.487 --> 21:55.836
I SAY IT, ALL RIGHT?
OH, REALLY? IS THAT SO?

21:55.836 --> 21:57.533
THAT'S NEVER
GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN.

21:57.533 --> 21:59.361
DON'T
PUSH IT, CHARLIE,
I'M WARNING YOU!

21:59.361 --> 22:03.322
IS THAT WHY
YOU'RE DOING THIS,
TO TEST ME?

22:03.322 --> 22:04.323
I DON'T HAVE TO
LISTEN TO THIS.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.367
DAPHNE,
WAIT A MINUTE.

22:05.367 --> 22:06.281
YOU CAN'T JUST--

22:07.761 --> 22:09.850
DAPHNE, COME BACK HERE.

22:09.850 --> 22:11.112
UH...

22:11.112 --> 22:13.941
NO MORE PRESENTS
TO OPEN. OK?

22:13.941 --> 22:15.725
WH--YOU KNOW,

22:15.725 --> 22:17.423
NOW WOULD
BE A PERFECT TIME
FOR THE LIMERICK.

22:17.423 --> 22:18.685
SARAH?

22:18.685 --> 22:20.861
A-ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
RIGHT NOW?

22:20.861 --> 22:22.428
RIGHT NOW.

22:22.428 --> 22:23.559
OK.

22:23.559 --> 22:25.561
OK. UH...

22:25.561 --> 22:28.825
IT WAS--IT WAS MEANT TO--
TO MAKE YOU GUYS LAUGH.

22:28.825 --> 22:30.174
AHEM.

22:30.174 --> 22:31.785
THERE ONCE WAS A GIRL
NAME OF CLAUD...

22:31.785 --> 22:33.264
YOU OK?

22:33.264 --> 22:34.918
WHO PLAYED FIDDLE SO WELL
WE WERE AWED.

22:34.918 --> 22:36.355
NO. NO, I'M NOT.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.182
BUT NOW SHE PLAYS
FOR A WHOLE NEW CROWD.

22:38.182 --> 22:39.967
SHE BETTER START
BOWING IT EXTRA LOUD...

22:39.967 --> 22:41.577
I GOT A BIG PROBLEM
HERE, DON'T I?

22:41.577 --> 22:43.144
'CAUSE WE STILL
WANT TO HEAR HER PLAY,

22:43.144 --> 22:46.060
EVEN THOUGH
SHE'S A CONTINENT AWAY.

22:46.060 --> 22:49.019
YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS
THINKING ABOUT LAST NIGHT?

22:49.019 --> 22:50.499
HMM?

22:50.499 --> 22:52.327
I'VE BEEN ALIVE 16 YEARS,

22:52.327 --> 22:54.634
AND...THAT WHOLE TIME,

22:54.634 --> 22:56.984
I'VE ONLY EVER HAD 3 ROOMS.

22:56.984 --> 23:00.335
OWEN'S AND THE TENT AND...

23:00.335 --> 23:02.424
HERE.

23:02.424 --> 23:04.121
GOD.

23:04.121 --> 23:06.515
OWEN'S ROOM.
I WAS IN THERE, TOO.

23:06.515 --> 23:08.604
I DON'T EVEN
REMEMBER THAT.

23:08.604 --> 23:10.127
ME NEITHER.

23:10.127 --> 23:12.782
WHICH MEANS THAT...

23:12.782 --> 23:17.004
FOR ALMOST
ALL OF GROWING UP, THE PLACE
THAT I FELL ASLEEP WAS...

23:17.004 --> 23:17.961
THIS PLACE...

23:19.963 --> 23:22.618
LOOKING UP
AT THIS CEILING.

23:22.618 --> 23:24.577
LISTENING TO ME
SNORE NEXT TO YOU.

23:24.577 --> 23:25.969
[LAUGHING]

23:35.196 --> 23:38.939
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO BE
HAPPY THERE, JULE...

23:38.939 --> 23:42.638
WHEN...THERE'S NOTHING
AROUND ME THAT I RECOGNIZE

23:42.638 --> 23:45.032
AND--AND THERE'S
ALL THESE NEW PEOPLE

23:45.032 --> 23:47.904
WHO JUST THINK OF ME
AS GOD KNOWS WHAT?

23:49.340 --> 23:50.254
THAT'S...

23:53.606 --> 23:55.956
IT'S NOT
GONNA BE THAT WAY.

23:55.956 --> 23:58.437
YOU'RE GONNA MEET
NICE PEOPLE.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.962
YOU'RE GONNA GET TO KNOW
THAT PLACE IN NO TIME.

24:03.180 --> 24:05.400
BUT WHAT IF I HATE IT?

24:05.400 --> 24:09.186
I MEAN, WHAT IF
ALL I CAN THINK OF IS HOME?

24:09.186 --> 24:12.581
WELL, I HIGHLY DOUBT
THAT'LL HAPPEN.

24:12.581 --> 24:15.105
BUT IF IT DOES,
GUESS WHAT.

24:15.105 --> 24:17.499
ALL THAT STUFF YOU'RE
SCARED OF MISSING--

24:17.499 --> 24:19.588
THE HOUSE AND US--

24:19.588 --> 24:21.764
IT'S ALWAYS
GONNA BE HERE.

24:21.764 --> 24:26.160
AND THANK GOD,
'CAUSE IT'S NOT JUST
YOU WHO NEEDS IT.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.075
AND WHEN YOU NEED TO,

24:28.075 --> 24:34.081
YOU'LL LIE IN YOUR BED
AND YOU'LL THINK
OF US TOGETHER.

24:34.081 --> 24:38.085
WE'VE SPENT
A LOT OF TIME LIKE THIS
TOGETHER, YOU AND ME.

24:38.085 --> 24:41.088
IT OUGHT TO BE
PRETTY EASY
FOR YOU TO PICTURE.

24:48.574 --> 24:49.575
ACTUALLY...

24:53.100 --> 24:57.278
IF THERE WAS ANY WAY
I COULD PACK THIS CEILING...

24:57.278 --> 24:58.671
I WOULD.

25:36.796 --> 25:39.015
I STAYED AT DUSTY'S.

25:39.015 --> 25:40.190
FINE.
I'M NOT ASKING YOU--

25:40.190 --> 25:41.278
I DRANK
LOTS OF WATER.

25:41.278 --> 25:43.150
I DIDN'T
HAVE ANY COFFEE.

25:43.150 --> 25:44.717
YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN
ANYTHING TO ME. I'M NOT...

25:44.717 --> 25:46.414
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT.

25:46.414 --> 25:48.416
WELL, THERE'S GOTTA
BE SOMETHING, CHARLIE,

25:48.416 --> 25:51.201
'CAUSE YOU STAYED
OUT HERE ALL NIGHT
TO SEE ME.

25:51.201 --> 25:53.029
NO, I DIDN'T.

25:53.029 --> 25:56.076
I GOT UP TO SAY
GOOD-BYE TO CLAUD.

25:56.076 --> 26:00.167
OH. AREN'T YOU
SUPPOSED TO BE HALFWAY
TO BOSTON BY NOW?

26:00.167 --> 26:03.779
I ASKED BAILEY TO GO...
'CAUSE I WANTED TO STAY HERE.

26:03.779 --> 26:05.694
I THOUGHT MAYBE
IF WE TALKED THAT...

26:08.915 --> 26:11.744
I MEAN, WHAT ARE
WE GONNA DO, DAPHNE?

26:11.744 --> 26:13.963
HOW ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO THIS?

26:13.963 --> 26:18.315
I MEAN, WE CAN'T JUST
SLEEP IN SEPARATE ROOMS
AND AVOID EACH OTHER.

26:18.315 --> 26:20.361
YOU'RE HAVING
OUR BABY HERE.

26:20.361 --> 26:23.843
SO, WHATEVER IT IS
YOU WANT ME TO DO,

26:23.843 --> 26:26.889
EVEN IF IT'S JUST TO SHUT UP
AND GIVE YOU SOME SPACE,

26:26.889 --> 26:29.544
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME. OK?

26:29.544 --> 26:31.720
AND...I'LL TRY TO DO IT.

26:33.330 --> 26:35.594
YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE
WITH YOUR SISTER.

26:43.689 --> 26:45.691
OK. LISTEN,
I KNOW WE SAID

26:45.691 --> 26:48.084
WE'D HIT THE ROAD
AS SOON AS SHE GOT IN,

26:48.084 --> 26:49.999
BUT CLAUD SEEMED
A LITTLE TWEAKED BEFORE,

26:49.999 --> 26:53.002
SO WHY DON'T WE CHILL
AND EASE HER IN A BIT?

26:53.002 --> 26:55.439
WHICH, ACTUALLY,
WE COULD HAVE
A PRETTY FLY TIME,

26:55.439 --> 26:56.789
'CAUSE THEY'RE
THROWING DOWN

26:56.789 --> 26:58.399
THIS ORIENTATION BASH
FOR THE KIDS,

26:58.399 --> 26:59.618
WITH SPORTS AND GAMES--

26:59.618 --> 27:02.359
OH, CLAUDIA. HEY.HEY.

27:02.359 --> 27:04.666
YOU WERE GONE FOR A WHILE.
DID YOU MAKE SOME FRIENDS?

27:04.666 --> 27:06.015
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BELIEVE IT,

27:06.015 --> 27:07.582
BUT I'M WALKING
DOWN THE HALL, RIGHT,

27:07.582 --> 27:09.584
AND I--I HEAR
THESE STRINGS
TUNING,

27:09.584 --> 27:11.151
SO I--I JUST
STARTED TALKING

27:11.151 --> 27:12.979
TO THIS
REALLY FRIENDLY
VIOLA PLAYER.

27:12.979 --> 27:14.197
AND THEN THERE'S
THIS GIRL

27:14.197 --> 27:15.677
ON THE PHONE
SPEAKING DUTCH,

27:15.677 --> 27:17.810
AND, WELL, I KNOW
SOME DIRTY WORDS
IN DUTCH

27:17.810 --> 27:19.333
FROM THAT MUSIC CAMP
I WENT TO.

27:19.333 --> 27:21.117
SO I, LIKE,
TOTALLY STARTED
CRACKING HER UP,

27:21.117 --> 27:22.597
- AND IT WAS...
- GREAT!

27:22.597 --> 27:24.686
WELL, WHEN-WHEN'S THAT
ORIENTATION DUE?

27:24.686 --> 27:26.949
THE VOLLEYBALL THING IS
SUPPOSED TO BE STARTING
ANY MINUTE NOW.

27:26.949 --> 27:28.995
COOLIO. LET'S ROLL.

27:28.995 --> 27:31.301
I WANT TO
TEACH THESE PREPSTERS
HOW WE SPIKE THAT BAD BOY

27:31.301 --> 27:33.390
IN THE NATIVE LAND
OF V-BALL.

27:33.390 --> 27:36.263
THAT'S...
WHATEVER, BAY.

27:36.263 --> 27:39.135
BUT I WAS JUST
KIND OF THINKING,
YOU KNOW,

27:39.135 --> 27:42.312
WHAT IF YOU DIDN'T?REALLY?

27:42.312 --> 27:45.011
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
THERE IS THIS
COCKTAIL PARTY,

27:45.011 --> 27:47.230
FOR THE PARENTS, UP ON
THE HEADMASTER'S GREEN,

27:47.230 --> 27:50.233
AND, WELL, THAT'S
REALLY WHERE YOU GUYS
SHOULD BE GOING, SO...

27:50.233 --> 27:52.061
PARENTS?

27:52.061 --> 27:54.585
AND IF YOU OWN A BUSINESS,
FORGET FINANCIAL AID.

27:54.585 --> 27:57.153
THEY SEE CORPORATE ASSETS,
AND, BOOM, YOU MUST BE LOADED,

27:57.153 --> 27:58.241
NEVER MIND
THE BOTTOM LINE.

27:58.241 --> 28:00.156
BAILEY HAS
A BUSINESS.

28:00.156 --> 28:01.810
WAS THAT SUPPOSED
TO BE ON CLAUDIA'S
APPLICATION?

28:01.810 --> 28:03.246
I DON'T KNOW.
I DIDN'T FILL IT OUT.

28:03.246 --> 28:05.074
BECAUSE I'M NOT
HER LEGAL GUARDIAN.

28:05.074 --> 28:06.554
ACTUALLY, I'M BARELY
OLDER THAN SHE IS.

28:06.554 --> 28:08.425
YOUR CAR, YOUR COMPUTER,
YOUR CLOTHES.

28:08.425 --> 28:10.906
THEY EVEN WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU LIFE INSURANCE
IS WORTH,

28:10.906 --> 28:13.213
LIKE MAYBE
YOU'LL CROAK JUST TO PAY
YOUR KID'S TUITION.

28:13.213 --> 28:15.128
DIDN'T YOU JUST GET
ONE OF THOSE POLICIES?

28:15.128 --> 28:16.782
YEAH. WELL--

28:16.782 --> 28:18.871
AND HAVE YOU GOTTEN
THE FRIENDS OF HANOVER PITCH?

28:18.871 --> 28:21.525
AS IF IT'S NOT ENOUGH
SIGNING OVER YOUR NEST EGG
FOR TUITION.

28:21.525 --> 28:23.049
I MEAN, WHERE IS IT WRITTEN

28:23.049 --> 28:25.225
THAT JUST BECAUSE
WE'RE PAST OUR PRIME,

28:25.225 --> 28:28.054
WE HAVE TO BE PACKED
INTO SOME PETUNIA GARDEN
AND FED FINGER SANDWICHES?

28:28.054 --> 28:30.665
WE WERE JUST SAYING
THE SAME THING,
WEREN'T WE, HONEY?

28:30.665 --> 28:31.666
OK, THAT'S IT.

28:31.666 --> 28:32.667
THAT'S WHAT?

28:32.667 --> 28:34.147
I--I NEED TO LEAVE.

28:34.147 --> 28:35.235
I NEED HAIR.

28:35.235 --> 28:37.106
I MEAN AIR.
I HAVE TO LEAVE.

28:37.106 --> 28:38.238
SARAH. NOW.

28:38.238 --> 28:39.152
OK.

28:44.810 --> 28:47.769
YOU REMEMBER ME?
I BROUGHT SOME FOOD
TO YOUR ROOM.

28:49.815 --> 28:51.773
EXCEPT
IT WASN'T FOR YOU,

28:51.773 --> 28:55.603
'CAUSE, UH, YOUR NAME
ISN'T, UH, LISA.

28:57.605 --> 28:58.606
HOW'S IT GOING?

29:05.178 --> 29:06.788
HEY, YOU'RE WRITING
SOMETHING THERE.

29:06.788 --> 29:09.095
MAYBE THE, UH,
GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL.

29:12.925 --> 29:15.536
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING?

29:15.536 --> 29:18.147
'CAUSE--'CAUSE IT'S SOMETHING
THAT'S REALLY BEEN
BUGGING ME LATELY.

29:18.147 --> 29:21.194
WHAT PART
OF ME SITTING HERE,
BY MYSELF, WORKING,

29:21.194 --> 29:23.457
MAKES YOU THINK,
"OH, I KNOW WHAT SHE WANTS.

29:23.457 --> 29:25.546
SHE WANTS ME TO DROP
WHAT SHE'S DOING
SO I CAN HIT ON HER."

29:25.546 --> 29:26.808
SORRY.
I DIDN'T REALIZE--

29:26.808 --> 29:29.028
EVEN IF I HAVE
A SMALL INTEREST

29:29.028 --> 29:31.117
IN THE GENERAL IDEA
OF DATING AT SOME TIME
IN THE FAR DISTANT FUTURE,

29:31.117 --> 29:33.119
THE REASON YOU SEE ME
WORKING HERE RIGHT NOW

29:33.119 --> 29:35.556
IS BECAUSE I'M A STUDENT,
AND I'M HERE TO STUDY,

29:35.556 --> 29:37.863
AND IF MAYBE YOU CAN'T
UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE
YOU'RE NOT A STUDENT

29:37.863 --> 29:39.690
OR BECAUSE YOU ONLY
THINK WITH YOUR GONADS,

29:39.690 --> 29:41.431
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

29:41.431 --> 29:43.956
WHAT A PERSON LIKE ME
REALLY WANTS
IS FOR YOU

29:43.956 --> 29:46.828

I KNOW THAT, BUT...

34:15.227 --> 34:19.492
I'VE BEEN HAVING THESE--
THESE ANXIETY DREAMS,

34:19.492 --> 34:21.929
ABOUT THIS STUPID
GETTING OLDER STUFF,

34:21.929 --> 34:23.844
AND I WENT
SHOPPING FOR YOU,

34:23.844 --> 34:26.847

BECAUSE I--
I GUESS I JUST REALLY
WANTED IT TO BE RIGHT.

I WANTED YOU
TO BE RIGHT FOR IT...

LOVES BIRTHDAYS
MORE THAN I DO.

ALWAYS A KID, CLAUD.

MAKE LIKE
ALL OF MY STUPID JOKES
ARE FUNNY?

35:21.336 --> 35:24.339
AND WHO'S GONNA SIT
ON THAT COUNTER AND--

35:24.339 --> 35:26.341
AND CHOKE DOWN
MY OMELET DISASTERS...

35:28.865 --> 35:29.866
IF IT ISN'T YOU?

35:45.447 --> 35:48.494

CHANGE WITHOUT TELLING ME?

HOLD IT A MINUTE?

35:59.331 --> 36:00.984

36:00.984 --> 36:03.422
LISTEN, I HAVE A RIGHT
TO EXPLANATION, ALL RIGHT.

36:03.422 --> 36:05.815
I HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

36:10.342 --> 36:13.954
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED
TO US, CHARLIE,

36:13.954 --> 36:16.130
YOU KNOW, IF THINGS
HAD BEEN DIFFERENT?

36:16.130 --> 36:19.351
WE WOULD HAVE HAD
A GREAT COUPLE OF MONTHS.

36:19.351 --> 36:21.614
I MEAN, JUST GREAT.

36:21.614 --> 36:23.746
BUT THEN ONE OF US
WOULD HAVE STARTED TAKING
A COUPLE EXTRA DAYS

36:23.746 --> 36:25.922
TO CALL
THE OTHER PERSON BACK,

36:25.922 --> 36:28.011
AND THEN PRETTY SOON,
THE ONLY TIME WE WOULD
HAVE SEEN EACH OTHER

36:28.011 --> 36:29.012
WOULD HAVE BEEN
BY ACCIDENT.

36:31.014 --> 36:33.756
THEN I GOT PREGNANT.

36:33.756 --> 36:35.758
AND, I MEAN,
I HARDLY EVEN EVER KNEW

36:35.758 --> 36:39.327

BUT OK.

36:39.327 --> 36:42.374

36:45.420 --> 36:46.987
BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW
THE TRUTH, CHARLIE?

SO...

36:58.085 --> 37:01.088
LET'S JUST
CUT TO THE CHASE.

37:01.088 --> 37:02.176
OK?

37:02.176 --> 37:03.873
YOU KNOW?

37:03.873 --> 37:06.049
WHY DRAG THIS OUT?

37:12.795 --> 37:14.580
NO.

37:14.580 --> 37:17.235
I WON'T LET YOU.CHARLIE--

37:17.235 --> 37:19.062
AND I REALLY DON'T CARE
ABOUT ANY OF THAT,

TO--TO TEXAS?

37:41.998 --> 37:44.174

37:44.174 --> 37:45.263

37:48.788 --> 37:51.617

WHEN I GET THERE. OK?

38:14.683 --> 38:16.816

THAT YOU'RE EATING,

38:16.816 --> 38:19.166

THAT YOU CHOSE TO BE ALONE
FOR THAT PURPOSE.

I JUST QUICKLY
WANT TO SAY

38:20.515 --> 38:22.300
THAT I WAS
SO, SO, SO OUT OF LINE--

ONLY, YOU KNOW...

A DELIVERY BOY?

38:26.739 --> 38:28.567
AND THAT YOU COULDN'T
GRASP THE CONCEPT

38:28.567 --> 38:30.395
OF BEING SERIOUS
ABOUT SCHOOL,
WHEN OBVIOUSLY--

38:30.395 --> 38:32.875

NOT SO BRIGHT?

ASK ME OUT, WHICH WAS--

FIND HER PARENTS.

AND THEN WHAT?

39:34.067 --> 39:36.069
WHAT AM I GONNA SAY
TO THEM?

GONNA WANT TO HELP ME?

I COULD MAKE THAT WORK?
