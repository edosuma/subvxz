00:28.166 --> 00:30.790
Do you believe in Hell?

00:32.333 --> 00:36.165
That place which priests
talk about so much.

00:37.125 --> 00:39.124
A dark, cruel abyss,

00:39.708 --> 00:42.290
where the souls of the condemned
are sent,

00:43.333 --> 00:49.999
a place inhabited by terrible demons
who punish and torture the condemned.

00:51.083 --> 00:52.665
Hell,

00:53.208 --> 00:58.249
where all hope is lost once you enter.

00:59.416 --> 01:03.540
Hell's subjects
beguile sinners with ease,

01:03.875 --> 01:05.957
tempting them
with fulfilling their desires

01:06.125 --> 01:07.999
in exchange for their mortal souls.

01:08.875 --> 01:12.957
Few have escaped successfully
from such a terrible pact.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.707
This story, like many others,

01:17.458 --> 01:21.290
begins with a man of flesh and blood.

01:22.458 --> 01:27.124
A man who outwitted that fearful pact.

01:27.750 --> 01:29.749
A man

01:30.125 --> 01:31.374
so cruel

01:31.875 --> 01:35.207
that even the devil himself
would fear him.

01:36.750 --> 01:38.957
A blacksmith.

01:39.875 --> 01:43.957
<b>ERREMENTARI
(THE BLACKSMITH AND THE DEVIL)</b>

01:47.333 --> 01:51.415
1835. 1ST CARLIST WAR.
ÁLAVA, BASQUE COUNTRY

02:05.666 --> 02:07.374
Soldier! Come here!

02:17.750 --> 02:18.750
Well?

02:19.000 --> 02:23.415
Sir, it seems these "Carcas" were trying
to transport something to the north.

02:27.083 --> 02:28.874
Sir! Look at this!

02:33.833 --> 02:36.874
I bet Zumalacárregui will have trouble
entering Bilbao without this.

03:06.166 --> 03:07.415
That's enough!

03:08.000 --> 03:09.665
We don't have all day.

03:41.833 --> 03:43.207
Firing squad!

03:44.333 --> 03:45.333
Attention!

03:46.750 --> 03:47.750
Get ready!

03:48.791 --> 03:49.957
Take aim!

03:53.458 --> 03:54.458
Fire!

04:18.208 --> 04:20.540
Deliver this to the major. It's urgent.

06:05.416 --> 06:06.499
Devil!

06:12.291 --> 06:15.332
8 YEARS LATER

07:06.333 --> 07:07.874
Look at these treasures!

07:08.333 --> 07:10.040
Faustino, that's all rubbish.

07:11.083 --> 07:13.374
Santi, your eyes are deceiving you.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.832
Look at this, it's a relic.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.124
Links from the chain

07:19.791 --> 07:22.290
that the legendary Theodósio de Goñi
wore as penance

07:22.541 --> 07:27.457
when he witnessed
the death of the Dragon of Aralar

07:27.541 --> 07:29.499
at the hands of St. Michael!

07:30.958 --> 07:31.958
If you...

07:32.541 --> 07:33.790
bite this,

07:34.333 --> 07:36.624
it will ease your headache.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.207
Only 30 reals.

07:40.416 --> 07:42.457
Sell that to the priest.
I'm sure he'll buy it.

07:51.291 --> 07:53.707
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

07:54.291 --> 07:55.291
What can I get you?

07:55.791 --> 07:57.540
Nothing, thank you.

07:58.125 --> 08:00.082
Do you have a room free?

08:00.375 --> 08:02.207
Yes, and with a very comfortable bed.

08:02.541 --> 08:04.040
10 reals a night.

08:04.208 --> 08:05.208
Very well.

08:05.833 --> 08:07.290
I'll prepare it right away.

08:07.708 --> 08:09.749
Won't you have something meanwhile?

08:10.083 --> 08:13.290
I've got excellent patxaran.
The best in the district.

08:13.458 --> 08:15.165
And the txakoli is very good.

08:16.333 --> 08:18.374
I don't drink, thank you.

08:18.625 --> 08:21.624
May I ask what brings you to our town?

08:22.083 --> 08:23.499
My name is Alfredo Ortiz.

08:24.291 --> 08:27.290
I work for the Provincial Government.
I'm investigating a matter.

08:27.666 --> 08:29.665
An investigation? About what?

08:30.291 --> 08:32.749
I'm looking for a smithy in this area.

08:32.916 --> 08:34.207
There's only one smithy here,

08:34.832 --> 08:36.207
and it's in ruins.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.374
I need to talk to its proprietor,

08:38.791 --> 08:40.164
a certain Francisco.

08:40.375 --> 08:42.207
Patxi? The blacksmith?

08:42.416 --> 08:44.999
Don't even think of it! That man is mad.

08:45.750 --> 08:47.082
He's an animal.

08:47.833 --> 08:48.874
And he's dangerous.

08:49.291 --> 08:50.999
He's so fierce they call him the Hammer.

08:51.166 --> 08:53.749
The locals avoid that place.
It just brings trouble.

08:53.916 --> 08:56.999
I just need to go in there
to carry out a search.

08:57.750 --> 08:59.624
Is there something of value there?

09:00.416 --> 09:01.457
I'm sorry,

09:02.125 --> 09:03.125
that's confidential.

09:04.500 --> 09:05.665
Are you alone?

09:06.125 --> 09:07.125
Maybe...

09:07.291 --> 09:08.332
we could help you.

09:08.666 --> 09:11.915
I've come ahead
to start work on the investigation.

09:12.625 --> 09:15.124
The police will be here in a few days.

09:15.416 --> 09:18.499
Look, it's bad enough
that they raise our taxes.

09:18.666 --> 09:20.874
We don't need them coming here
with more nonsense.

09:21.041 --> 09:22.665
That smithy is a ruin.

09:23.875 --> 09:25.957
You won't find anything of value
in this area.

09:26.125 --> 09:28.749
During the war, everything was melted
down to make weapons.

09:29.041 --> 09:31.540
From cooking pots to the church bell.

09:32.166 --> 09:33.540
This is a poor town.

09:34.791 --> 09:36.624
And that room?

09:36.875 --> 09:37.875
Yes.

09:38.416 --> 09:39.416
Benito!

09:40.416 --> 09:42.124
Wipe the sleep from your eyes

09:42.708 --> 09:44.374
and take this gentleman to his room.

09:44.666 --> 09:45.666
I'm coming.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.499
And put a blanket over the still.

09:52.750 --> 09:54.165
Come this way, sir.

10:03.291 --> 10:04.374
By the way...

10:05.208 --> 10:07.082
How do I get to the smithy?

10:07.291 --> 10:10.415
Take the path on the left
when you reach the wash house.

10:11.458 --> 10:14.165
Then follow the river through the
forest.

10:15.500 --> 10:16.624
But be careful.

10:18.208 --> 10:19.790
The devil lives there.

11:10.916 --> 11:12.540
GET OUT OF HERE

12:22.625 --> 12:24.665
From what I hear,

12:25.125 --> 12:28.832
today a government official
has come to our town.

12:30.833 --> 12:31.833
Naive of me to think

12:32.000 --> 12:34.957
he would share our mass with us.

12:35.875 --> 12:41.207
Here we have the contempt
of the new government for the church.

12:41.958 --> 12:44.040
The devil is among us,

12:44.500 --> 12:46.624
walking through our lands,

12:47.125 --> 12:51.082
in the form of filthy liberal ideas
which draw good people away

12:51.291 --> 12:53.290
from the word of the Lord.

12:54.083 --> 12:56.415
It's been three years
since the war ended.

12:56.625 --> 12:57.665
Three years

12:58.125 --> 13:02.207
during which those avaricious bourgeois
fornicators have ruled the country.

13:02.416 --> 13:04.756
- Freedom of worship, civil matrimony.
- What's that?

13:04.816 --> 13:06.240
- Nothing.
- Give me that.

13:06.416 --> 13:08.332
They have even moved our borders

13:08.833 --> 13:11.499
and now traders can cross to the sea,

13:11.666 --> 13:13.874
without any control,
without paying duties.

13:14.500 --> 13:19.165
They have torn our customs,
our laws from us.

13:20.083 --> 13:22.457
What will be next?

13:23.500 --> 13:26.874
Let us pray to Our Lord Jesus Christ.

13:27.041 --> 13:28.665
We pray to you, our Lord.

13:40.166 --> 13:42.915
Benito, do you know where Usue is?

13:43.458 --> 13:44.790
How should I know?

13:45.125 --> 13:46.207
She must be around.

13:46.416 --> 13:49.957
- But you're always following after her!
- Don't be stupid!

13:54.416 --> 13:55.457
Mind your manners!

13:55.875 --> 13:58.915
Jesus, Mary and Joseph,
where has the child gone to?

14:01.333 --> 14:03.374
Let us proceed to the Eucharist.

14:03.916 --> 14:06.624
Let us drink the blood of the Lord.

14:13.708 --> 14:17.040
For God's sake, Blanca!
Where did you put the mass wine?

14:17.500 --> 14:18.500
There.

14:47.375 --> 14:49.499
I don't like it!

14:49.708 --> 14:53.415
Don't be cheeky, Matilde,
behave like a young lady!

14:54.000 --> 14:57.665
If your mother was alive,
she'd slap you!

14:58.458 --> 14:59.957
Are you crying again?

15:00.333 --> 15:02.374
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

15:03.458 --> 15:04.458
Come now,

15:05.000 --> 15:06.790
I didn't mean that.

15:08.541 --> 15:09.541
Here,

15:09.875 --> 15:11.040
a present.

15:11.750 --> 15:14.040
It was your mother's, you know?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.499
And you, Mr. Napoleon,

15:18.708 --> 15:21.207
console your wife, for God's sake!

15:22.208 --> 15:25.374
Let us drink the blood of the Lord.

15:33.916 --> 15:35.707
That's disgusting!

15:37.958 --> 15:40.499
Hello! You've come!

15:45.500 --> 15:47.874
You got our invitation!

15:49.708 --> 15:51.415
Sit with us.

15:56.875 --> 15:59.457
Let us continue with the mass.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.790
Yes! Right on its head!

16:12.541 --> 16:13.915
What did you do, you brute?

16:14.166 --> 16:16.999
Shut up, shit face. I saved your life.

16:17.166 --> 16:20.874
- It was going to bite you.
- No, idiot! It was my friend!

16:21.000 --> 16:25.082
You're the idiot.
You're in trouble for missing mass.

16:25.291 --> 16:29.832
I don't care about going to mass.
That's for idiots like you.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.165
Then you'll go to Hell,

16:33.625 --> 16:34.790
like your mother.

16:35.125 --> 16:37.499
What? Are you going to cry?

16:40.291 --> 16:43.207
The hanged woman is burning!

16:43.875 --> 16:45.040
Shut up!

17:15.415 --> 17:16.749
Matilde!

17:16.958 --> 17:19.540
Please, Usue, help me!

17:32.416 --> 17:35.040
No!

17:36.000 --> 17:37.749
Take your doll.

17:46.041 --> 17:49.082
- Hold your head back.
- I know that!

17:53.833 --> 17:55.374
Why are you stopping?

18:09.458 --> 18:11.415
It's the mad blacksmith.

18:11.791 --> 18:15.374
They say he kidnaps children,

18:15.500 --> 18:17.207
slits them open

18:17.500 --> 18:20.415
and sucks out their guts.

18:20.958 --> 18:23.124
My grandfather said

18:23.416 --> 18:25.457
that he killed his wife.

18:25.833 --> 18:27.207
He's scary.

18:28.125 --> 18:30.207
Well, he doesn't scare me.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.457
He looks like a beggar.

18:32.750 --> 18:33.750
Not so loud.

18:34.666 --> 18:36.540
- I bet I can hit him.
- Benito, no!

19:16.500 --> 19:19.790
The cock crowing at this time
is a bad omen.

19:22.500 --> 19:23.481
Benito!

19:23.541 --> 19:24.707
Come here.

19:27.416 --> 19:28.957
What happened to your nose?

19:29.125 --> 19:31.915
We were playing near the smithy
and Usu...

19:32.541 --> 19:33.541
and I slipped.

19:34.291 --> 19:36.165
Lord knows what you were doing!

19:36.333 --> 19:38.499
Why were you there, anyway?

19:38.666 --> 19:41.290
I've told you to stay away
from that place!

19:41.666 --> 19:43.207
I went looking for Usue.

19:43.416 --> 19:44.707
And where is she?

19:44.875 --> 19:46.290
I don't know, she stayed there.

19:46.458 --> 19:48.332
What'll I do with that girl?

19:48.500 --> 19:49.500
Did you lose her?

19:50.125 --> 19:53.207
Why do I have to look after that runt?

19:54.708 --> 19:56.040
Watch your mouth.

19:57.666 --> 19:59.290
There she is!

19:59.625 --> 20:00.625
Usue!

20:00.875 --> 20:02.040
Come here!

20:02.833 --> 20:06.457
Do you think this is normal?
To disappear and not come to mass?

20:08.833 --> 20:10.082
Is that blood?

20:10.500 --> 20:13.290
The mass wine... Did you take it?

20:14.500 --> 20:17.207
You shameless pup!

20:17.458 --> 20:19.457
- I'll show you...
- Don Mateo!

20:19.625 --> 20:21.624
- Leave her to me.
- Child,

20:21.791 --> 20:24.332
you'll end up in Hell.

20:24.500 --> 20:26.999
I don't care! Hell is a lie!

20:27.166 --> 20:28.374
Usue, that's enough.

20:28.500 --> 20:31.665
Leave me alone!
You're not my mother! My mother is dead!

20:34.041 --> 20:35.457
You should be harder on her.

20:35.625 --> 20:38.832
Remember she's your responsibility,
not mine.

20:51.708 --> 20:52.957
- Santi!
- What?

20:53.458 --> 20:56.249
- Why aren't you behind the bar?
- Just a minute, dear.

20:56.416 --> 20:57.416
Just a minute?

20:58.458 --> 20:59.915
It's a letter from the war...

21:00.125 --> 21:01.540
"Carlist load,

21:02.083 --> 21:03.499
a chest full of gold"...

21:03.900 --> 21:04.890
Gold?

21:05.000 --> 21:07.540
Could that be
what the dandy's looking for?

21:07.791 --> 21:09.290
The treasure of Zumalacárregui.

21:09.458 --> 21:11.165
A treasure? Here in the town?

21:11.708 --> 21:12.708
Excuse me,

21:13.208 --> 21:14.499
but I think that's mine.

21:14.916 --> 21:17.040
Look, my son is a blockhead.

21:17.500 --> 21:20.624
He took it out of curiosity.

21:20.833 --> 21:22.124
I should report this.

21:23.125 --> 21:24.290
Don't do that.

21:24.708 --> 21:25.832
What about...

21:26.291 --> 21:29.290
if I let you have the room
at half price?

21:32.166 --> 21:35.457
No charge.
You're our guest. What do you say?

21:36.833 --> 21:38.165
What about...

21:39.166 --> 21:42.165
if you help me
get into the smithy today

21:43.083 --> 21:44.790
and we'll forget everything?

21:45.500 --> 21:46.500
Today?

21:46.708 --> 21:47.708
I don't know.

21:48.708 --> 21:49.708
Maybe later.

21:49.833 --> 21:50.874
- Santi!
- What?

21:51.041 --> 21:53.165
- You have work in the bar.
- Ana!

21:53.291 --> 21:55.124
I have to do the cooking.

21:55.291 --> 21:58.082
Don't worry, brother.
I'll do it with my friends

21:58.250 --> 21:59.999
to pay back what I see you.

22:00.333 --> 22:02.040
That's not a bad idea.

22:02.291 --> 22:03.291
Ana.

22:04.083 --> 22:05.332
It's fine with me.

22:06.875 --> 22:09.040
Do you think there's gold in the smithy?

22:10.250 --> 22:13.290
12 pounds in pieces of gold.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.665
Donated by the Tsar of Russia
to the Carlist cause

22:16.875 --> 22:20.249
so that Captain Tomás Zumalacárregui
could lay siege to Bilbao.

22:20.833 --> 22:23.374
But the gold never reached
its destination.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.874
How do you know all that?

22:26.166 --> 22:27.499
It was a rumour

22:28.250 --> 22:29.790
among the soldiers.

22:30.250 --> 22:32.540
I thought it was a tale to entertain us.

22:32.833 --> 22:35.957
But they also said there were Lamias
on the banks of the Bidasoa,

22:36.125 --> 22:37.790
women with ducks' feet.

22:37.958 --> 22:40.540
Be quiet!
You're a bore with those stories!

22:41.875 --> 22:46.832
This letter and the enlistment documents
point directly to that blacksmith.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.249
If I were you,
I wouldn't go near that place.

22:51.375 --> 22:53.207
You know how his wife was found.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.040
She killed herself

22:58.666 --> 23:01.332
because she was so unhappy with him.

23:01.666 --> 23:03.124
The Hammer lost his mind,

23:03.375 --> 23:05.165
he stopped speaking to people

23:05.708 --> 23:07.124
and started behaving violently.

23:07.291 --> 23:09.624
He left Fermín, the honey maker,
lame in one leg,

23:09.916 --> 23:11.790
just for speaking to him.

23:13.458 --> 23:14.458
At night,

23:15.166 --> 23:16.207
you can hear him

23:16.958 --> 23:21.040
in the distance,
banging the anvil with his hammer.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.290
At times,

23:23.541 --> 23:26.665
there are horrible screams too,
that chill your blood.

23:27.166 --> 23:31.874
Some say that
it's the ghost of his wife, screaming.

23:32.958 --> 23:35.457
Others say that

23:36.041 --> 23:40.207
it's the devil,
who wants to take the blacksmith's soul.

23:41.041 --> 23:42.624
Will you tell me the joke

23:43.041 --> 23:44.457
so I can laugh too?

23:44.625 --> 23:46.415
No, it's nothing.

23:46.541 --> 23:49.665
We were just saying
how elegantly you're dressed.

23:50.875 --> 23:53.624
It's the beret my father wore
during the war.

23:55.166 --> 23:56.499
Go in and search the place

23:57.083 --> 23:58.957
until you find something suspicious.

24:03.541 --> 24:04.915
Aren't you coming?

24:05.083 --> 24:06.624
I'd just be in the way.

24:07.166 --> 24:09.624
I'm no good at field work.

24:09.833 --> 24:10.833
As you wish.

24:11.458 --> 24:12.665
There's a chain.

24:22.166 --> 24:24.207
Now you're not laughing so much, eh?

24:24.375 --> 24:26.040
OK, like we said.

24:26.416 --> 24:27.416
Let's go.

25:10.791 --> 25:11.832
Go away!

25:16.208 --> 25:17.208
Listen,

25:18.125 --> 25:19.057
excuse me...

25:19.125 --> 25:20.332
Get out of here!

25:20.500 --> 25:22.957
This is an official mission,

25:23.208 --> 25:25.457
we represent the government.

25:25.750 --> 25:28.082
Open the door, it's a search.

25:28.250 --> 25:29.624
I said, get out of here!

25:32.291 --> 25:36.832
Please, come out,
or we'll have to enter by force.

25:42.625 --> 25:44.124
For your own good,

25:44.500 --> 25:46.332
it's best if you come out.

26:06.166 --> 26:07.874
Back!

26:29.291 --> 26:33.999
Miguel!

26:41.916 --> 26:42.999
Get out of here!

26:58.458 --> 26:59.458
Hey!

27:05.291 --> 27:06.540
Where's Lucas?

27:06.833 --> 27:09.665
- And the dandy?
- I don't know! Run!

27:49.166 --> 27:51.499
What an ugly doll. It's got no head.

27:52.666 --> 27:55.540
Mine is pretty,
my father bought it for me.

27:55.833 --> 27:56.833
Can I hold it?

27:56.958 --> 28:00.332
No! Don't let her.
She can play with her dead doll.

28:00.500 --> 28:01.624
She isn't dead.

28:01.833 --> 28:04.999
If she's got no head, she can't eat,
and so she'll die.

28:06.500 --> 28:09.665
My mother says
that her mother hanged herself.

28:11.083 --> 28:14.457
Your mother is in Hell.

28:14.625 --> 28:16.374
Leave us in peace!

28:18.083 --> 28:21.499
Go hang from a rope,
go hang from a rope!

28:24.166 --> 28:25.957
Go hang from a rope, shit face!

28:34.541 --> 28:36.332
You're not dead.

28:45.291 --> 28:46.374
Leave that there

28:46.833 --> 28:48.499
and put more wood on the fire.

29:12.375 --> 29:13.375
Usue,

29:13.958 --> 29:16.665
I know that I'm hard on you at times.

29:17.250 --> 29:19.665
I have to be,
to keep you on the right road.

29:20.208 --> 29:24.499
But I want you to know
that I'm always here for you.

29:26.500 --> 29:30.707
If someone hangs himself and dies,
does he always go to Hell?

29:31.250 --> 29:33.915
Suicide is a mortal sin, you know that.

29:34.333 --> 29:38.624
Hell is the only place
those poor souls can go.

29:38.833 --> 29:42.624
But if that person wasn't bad,
is there no way to come back?

29:44.708 --> 29:47.124
Some things just can't be fixed, child.

29:47.333 --> 29:48.333
But...?

29:49.500 --> 29:51.832
No more nonsense, forget it.

29:54.625 --> 29:56.415
Usue, where are you going?

30:04.291 --> 30:06.290
But you can be fixed.

30:24.625 --> 30:25.790
Don't worry, Matilde.

30:25.958 --> 30:29.499
I'll find your head
and you'll be alive again.

31:31.708 --> 31:33.040
Where is the spade?

33:18.333 --> 33:19.915
Hello?

33:24.000 --> 33:26.915
Don't make any noise. Help me, please.

33:27.041 --> 33:30.624
Get me out of here
before he comes back!

33:31.083 --> 33:32.874
He hurts me.

33:35.250 --> 33:36.290
He's a monster.

33:36.458 --> 33:39.749
Please, little friend,
get me out of here.

34:04.458 --> 34:05.440
The keys!

34:05.500 --> 34:08.540
They're on his belt!
You have to get them!

34:08.833 --> 34:11.623
How? No, I can't...

34:11.916 --> 34:13.915
Yes! Yes, you can, little friend.

34:14.125 --> 34:15.498
Don't leave me here.

34:16.291 --> 34:17.540
It's horrible.

34:19.541 --> 34:21.373
He's coming back! Hide!

35:00.500 --> 35:03.124
Yes, hide! Son of a bitch!

37:31.666 --> 37:32.707
Come on!

37:50.000 --> 37:52.082
Hurry up! Before he wakes...

37:58.666 --> 38:00.290
Stop! Let me do it!

41:00.083 --> 41:02.749
If you take one more step,
I'll rip off her head.

41:19.750 --> 41:24.749
By Abraxas,
this isn't the end, blacksmith.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.499
Your soul belongs to me.
It belongs to me!

41:28.875 --> 41:33.374
I will return
with the most terrible infernal hosts

41:33.500 --> 41:35.999
to tear it out of you

41:36.500 --> 41:38.665
while you die,

41:38.833 --> 41:42.790
screaming
in the most unbearable torment!

41:44.500 --> 41:47.499
I'll take this titbit for the journey.

41:56.416 --> 41:57.416
No!

42:06.041 --> 42:07.041
My horn!

42:08.541 --> 42:10.540
Damn bastard!

42:10.750 --> 42:15.207
I'll slit you open and eat your guts!

43:10.625 --> 43:12.749
- Be careful!
- Didn't you even manage to get in?

43:17.875 --> 43:19.332
That place is a fortress.

43:19.958 --> 43:22.790
It's obvious... he has the gold.

43:23.125 --> 43:25.082
I told you not to go there.

43:25.291 --> 43:26.540
We have to get him.

43:26.875 --> 43:29.249
For Lucas, an eye for an eye.

43:29.416 --> 43:30.457
Don't be stupid.

43:30.708 --> 43:33.115
- Do you want to get killed too?
- I'm not going back.

43:33.708 --> 43:35.082
- Santi!
- What?

43:36.500 --> 43:38.790
Where's Benito? It's getting dark.

43:38.958 --> 43:39.958
I don't know.

43:40.083 --> 43:41.832
Can't you see I'm busy?

43:43.375 --> 43:45.707
You should worry more
about your own family...

43:45.875 --> 43:47.624
- Ana!
- And less about those mules!

43:47.791 --> 43:49.374
This mule is my brother.

43:50.500 --> 43:51.500
Look.

43:51.750 --> 43:54.499
- There's the rascal. Come over here!
- Benito!

43:54.916 --> 43:57.707
Apologize to your mother
for having worried her.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.040
Wait, Santi.

43:59.416 --> 44:02.040
Something's happened to Usue.

44:03.333 --> 44:04.457
He's got her.

44:04.958 --> 44:07.540
The blacksmith's got Usue!

44:08.666 --> 44:10.040
He took her.

44:11.250 --> 44:13.290
And the devil was there too.

44:14.208 --> 44:16.374
Now, calm down, Benito.

44:17.125 --> 44:18.125
What are you saying?

44:18.500 --> 44:21.415
Has the blacksmith got Usue?

44:21.541 --> 44:22.999
Yes, and it looked...

44:23.708 --> 44:25.457
It looked like she was dead.

44:28.958 --> 44:30.415
Stay with your mother.

44:32.458 --> 44:33.749
The poor child.

44:34.333 --> 44:35.749
We have to go and help her.

44:36.208 --> 44:37.707
That man is a danger.

44:40.500 --> 44:43.790
By the power vested in me
by the government, I authorize you

44:44.083 --> 44:45.499
to take the necessary measures.

44:45.625 --> 44:48.457
- That degenerate bastard.
- I'm going there.

44:50.791 --> 44:51.791
Ana.

44:52.083 --> 44:53.540
Tell everyone you know,

44:53.958 --> 44:57.499
they're to get armed
and meet us on the path to the smithy.

44:58.250 --> 45:00.374
- Hurry.
- Who's coming with me?

45:02.791 --> 45:05.082
I'm in. Who else?

45:55.916 --> 45:58.832
Some day they'll come looking for me.

45:59.000 --> 46:03.790
And I'll throw your soul
into the darkest, most horrible abyss!

46:04.041 --> 46:06.040
Look who missed you!

46:14.625 --> 46:16.874
Do what you want. I don't care.

46:17.041 --> 46:20.540
Time doesn't pass for me.

46:20.708 --> 46:21.957
But you,

46:22.125 --> 46:25.499
sooner or later, you'll die,

46:25.666 --> 46:29.040
and then you'll end up keeping
the pact you made.

46:29.875 --> 46:31.624
There is no pact now.

46:31.750 --> 46:33.540
I gave you what you wanted!

46:33.708 --> 46:37.540
You got home safe and sound
to see your wife.

46:37.833 --> 46:39.957
But it shouldn't have been like that!

46:40.125 --> 46:46.749
It's not my fault that you're an ogre
and your wife found a better man.

47:00.375 --> 47:06.374
You can do what you want to me,
but you made an unbreakable pact.

47:06.500 --> 47:11.332
Hell never leaves any loose ends.

47:11.500 --> 47:14.832
You hear me? No loose ends!

47:33.875 --> 47:35.207
What are you doing here?

47:38.625 --> 47:39.790
Get out.

47:43.416 --> 47:44.416
Wait.

47:45.416 --> 47:46.416
Sit down.

47:48.708 --> 47:49.832
Don't be afraid.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
Sit down.

48:02.500 --> 48:03.500
Is this yours?

48:15.541 --> 48:16.665
Give me the scarf.

48:30.041 --> 48:31.041
And the scarf?

48:33.541 --> 48:34.790
Is that yours too?

48:35.750 --> 48:37.374
It was my mother's.

48:45.125 --> 48:46.915
Son of a thousand bitches!

48:48.125 --> 48:49.457
Don't be afraid.

48:51.750 --> 48:53.040
He's well chained up.

48:55.916 --> 48:57.749
But you were lucky.

49:07.541 --> 49:08.749
Is he the devil?

49:09.916 --> 49:11.415
Just a demon.

49:12.708 --> 49:14.249
And he can't escape?

49:15.375 --> 49:17.665
He can't go back empty-handed.

49:18.416 --> 49:21.040
You're just a messenger,
isn't that right, Sartael?

49:21.625 --> 49:22.625
Yes,

49:23.458 --> 49:26.540
and I've got a message
for you from Hell.

49:26.791 --> 49:30.707
Your wife sends you warmest greetings!

49:42.500 --> 49:45.082
What are you looking at, little girl?

49:56.250 --> 49:57.790
Liar!

50:15.083 --> 50:16.083
Wait.

50:16.666 --> 50:17.666
Stand back.

50:24.958 --> 50:25.958
Watch this.

50:26.416 --> 50:29.124
No, no, not the chickpeas.

50:29.458 --> 50:31.332
How many chickpeas are there?

50:37.666 --> 50:41.457
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

50:41.625 --> 50:45.790
He can't help it, he has to count them.

50:48.208 --> 50:52.499
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

50:53.791 --> 50:55.915
Don't do that!

50:56.791 --> 50:57.790
1, 2, 3, 4,

50:57.950 --> 51:04.340
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13...

51:04.750 --> 51:05.750
Little girl.

51:06.666 --> 51:08.374
Another thing.

51:08.833 --> 51:14.874
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28,

51:15.041 --> 51:16.790
29, 30, 31...

51:22.125 --> 51:23.499
It's blessed.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.082
I hate you!

51:51.250 --> 51:54.499
I hate you! Damn humans...

51:55.500 --> 51:59.457
Why do I have to put up this? Why?

51:59.958 --> 52:01.290
Shut up!

52:01.875 --> 52:04.332
You're a bunch
of unbearable, whining souls.

52:04.708 --> 52:05.790
I hate you.

52:05.916 --> 52:09.499
Whining souls that we have to punish.

52:16.416 --> 52:19.415
But you are worse.

52:19.958 --> 52:26.832
You don't see your guilt
and you torment everyone else!

52:26.958 --> 52:29.624
Like you did with your wife!

52:36.791 --> 52:37.791
Leave.

52:38.291 --> 52:39.540
They'll be looking for you.

52:58.541 --> 52:59.541
Wait.

53:38.000 --> 53:39.832
What do you want?

53:40.416 --> 53:42.665
Haven't you had enough fun?

53:43.500 --> 53:49.790
I'm sorry I hurt you before.
I didn't mean to.

53:49.958 --> 53:51.624
By St. Michael's bastard!

53:51.916 --> 53:53.415
You, brat?

53:54.000 --> 53:57.207
Do you think you can hurt me?

53:58.000 --> 54:00.415
I was born in the flames of Hell.

54:02.250 --> 54:04.957
The thing is,
I have problems with my ears

54:05.750 --> 54:07.874
because of the damp in here.

54:09.375 --> 54:11.499
Are you from Hell? Really?

54:11.666 --> 54:13.665
What do you think?

54:14.000 --> 54:16.290
Have you seen my mother?

54:16.625 --> 54:18.540
Her name's Maite.

54:18.750 --> 54:21.665
There are lots of souls in Hell.

54:26.041 --> 54:29.790
How do you know your mother is in Hell?

54:30.500 --> 54:34.332
Was she bad to you?

54:38.125 --> 54:39.915
I never knew her.

54:40.500 --> 54:43.790
She killed herself soon
after I was born.

54:47.125 --> 54:51.624
Then you can be sure
that she's roasting down there.

54:51.791 --> 54:53.665
Is there no way to get her out?

54:56.500 --> 54:57.500
Get her out?

55:00.708 --> 55:01.915
Of Hell?

55:03.208 --> 55:06.332
Little girl, you're very funny.

55:08.083 --> 55:11.290
No one gets out of Hell.

55:11.750 --> 55:13.124
Why not?

55:13.291 --> 55:17.999
Because you condemn yourselves
during your lives.

55:19.041 --> 55:23.499
You should see
the lines of lost souls,

55:24.041 --> 55:27.624
dragged along by their guilt,
without anyone forcing them,

55:27.791 --> 55:30.457
waiting to get into Hell.

55:31.041 --> 55:35.415
And once they've passed through
those gates,

55:35.875 --> 55:38.749
there's no going back.

55:39.375 --> 55:42.999
Things are as they are
and they can't be changed.

55:43.458 --> 55:47.499
One's fate is written.

55:54.916 --> 55:55.916
He's lying.

55:57.458 --> 55:58.707
He always lies.

56:02.083 --> 56:03.083
Let's go.

56:04.875 --> 56:07.124
I'll walk you to the crossroads.

56:31.166 --> 56:32.290
There they are!

56:33.000 --> 56:34.082
Usue!

56:46.750 --> 56:47.731
Patxi,

56:47.791 --> 56:49.040
let the girl go.

56:49.708 --> 56:50.874
Come here, Usue!

57:05.500 --> 57:08.290
What did that monster do to you?

57:08.500 --> 57:10.790
Nothing, I'm fine, I just fell.

57:11.166 --> 57:12.499
You killed Lucas!

57:12.916 --> 57:14.332
It was an accident.

57:14.500 --> 57:15.500
Liar!

57:15.666 --> 57:17.207
You killed him with your own hands.

57:17.750 --> 57:19.165
I saw it!

57:19.375 --> 57:22.624
Grab him, he's a murderer!
Don't let him get away!

57:42.666 --> 57:43.666
No!

57:52.333 --> 57:53.333
Stop!

58:15.083 --> 58:16.083
Mateo!

58:17.083 --> 58:19.624
Patxi, don't fight them.

58:20.166 --> 58:21.624
Don't make it worse.

58:33.791 --> 58:35.499
We should search the smithy.

58:36.125 --> 58:39.249
We'll have a look at your house.

58:40.208 --> 58:41.290
The child is safe.

58:41.708 --> 58:42.708
I'm glad.

58:43.291 --> 58:45.499
You can go home and rest.

58:45.750 --> 58:48.332
You can't search the smithy on your own.

58:48.750 --> 58:50.082
I'm well accompanied.

58:50.708 --> 58:54.457
I appreciate your collaboration,
but, please, let me do my work.

58:54.750 --> 58:55.999
This is our town

58:56.375 --> 58:58.207
and we're going, like it or not.

58:58.375 --> 58:59.375
Come on!

59:14.416 --> 59:15.416
Be careful!

59:15.666 --> 59:16.957
There are traps!

59:25.250 --> 59:27.374
I know the girl is Maite's daughter,

59:28.416 --> 59:29.915
but I always had doubts.

59:30.375 --> 59:31.499
Is she his daughter too?

59:33.666 --> 59:34.666
No.

59:41.791 --> 59:43.957
It was eight years ago.

59:46.500 --> 59:50.499
I had commissioned a new bell
for the belfry from Patxi.

59:51.708 --> 59:55.124
One night he came to my door
with the bell and something else.

59:55.750 --> 59:57.374
What have you done, Patxi?

59:57.708 --> 01:00:01.915
A recently born baby: Usue.

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:09.207
And then he told me what had happened.
He told me all about it.

01:00:09.375 --> 01:00:15.207
He had deserted, after two years
at the front, to come back to his wife.

01:00:23.666 --> 01:00:29.249
But when he came back
he found a baby that was not his.

01:00:30.875 --> 01:00:33.957
Maite thought
that Patxi had died in the war

01:00:34.875 --> 01:00:39.207
and she found consolation
in another man's arms.

01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:44.082
An outsider she had Usue with.

01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:54.540
Driven by an uncontrollable rage,

01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:59.374
Patxi held the baby
wanting to throw her into the fire.

01:01:04.333 --> 01:01:10.415
But the father appeared
and stopped the blacksmith.

01:01:10.791 --> 01:01:16.249
Patxi, full of rage,
run towards him and killed him.

01:01:17.208 --> 01:01:22.165
Maite tried to kill Patxi
but the blacksmith escaped death.

01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:29.624
Maite lost in despair killed herself.

01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:33.957
He didn't say anything to anyone.

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:39.124
He shut himself in his workshop
and forge the bell I asked him for.

01:01:40.708 --> 01:01:43.290
He brought the baby to me

01:01:43.875 --> 01:01:48.332
and none of us knew
anything more of him for months.

01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:01.915
Come on, it's safe!

01:02:11.458 --> 01:02:12.458
It's locked.

01:02:27.916 --> 01:02:30.457
Please, wait here for a moment.

01:02:31.125 --> 01:02:32.457
It might be dangerous.

01:02:33.166 --> 01:02:34.332
Bring the prisoner.

01:03:15.708 --> 01:03:16.708
God!

01:03:31.666 --> 01:03:33.832
The Dev... Dev... devil...

01:03:34.458 --> 01:03:35.874
Are you real?

01:03:37.875 --> 01:03:40.499
Come here, old man,
and I'll show you I'm real.

01:03:40.916 --> 01:03:41.916
Holy God.

01:03:43.291 --> 01:03:44.624
Thank you, Lord.

01:03:45.083 --> 01:03:47.249
Thank you for this gift.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.999
You're the living proof of faith.

01:03:51.541 --> 01:03:53.374
I'll take you to the Vatican

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:56.874
so that everyone
can see the face of evil.

01:03:57.166 --> 01:03:59.999
I'll be the hand of the Lord!

01:04:01.041 --> 01:04:02.249
Yes!

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.124
You get me out of here

01:04:05.541 --> 01:04:07.540
and I'll go wherever you want.

01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:10.290
They'll make you Pope!

01:04:10.458 --> 01:04:11.458
Silence, Beelzebub!

01:04:11.541 --> 01:04:14.207
Your blasphemous words
don't work with me.

01:04:14.541 --> 01:04:18.999
I'm not Beelzebub, you stupid old shit.

01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:24.124
But I see clearly
what the price of your soul is

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:27.415
and it isn't worth a fly.

01:04:30.833 --> 01:04:32.540
I must ask you to go outside.

01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:34.499
I have to question the accused.

01:04:34.958 --> 01:04:36.332
Don't be ridiculous.

01:04:36.666 --> 01:04:39.540
This is a Church matter.

01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:41.749
It's a ministry matter.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.332
I'm not moving from here.
The strength of the Lord is with me.

01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:52.481
Miguel!

01:04:52.541 --> 01:04:53.874
What are you doing?

01:04:54.291 --> 01:04:56.249
What you don't dare to do.

01:04:56.416 --> 01:04:58.249
Go back under your wife's skirts.

01:05:00.708 --> 01:05:01.648
What?

01:05:01.708 --> 01:05:03.124
Are you going to shoot me?

01:05:04.958 --> 01:05:06.499
You heard him, old man!

01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:09.540
- Swine!
- Please,

01:05:09.916 --> 01:05:11.165
wait outside.

01:05:12.125 --> 01:05:13.665
Santi! The keys...

01:05:27.375 --> 01:05:28.624
What happened?

01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:30.250
The devil...

01:05:30.375 --> 01:05:32.082
The devil is in there.

01:05:32.458 --> 01:05:34.624
- I saw him too.
- Jesus!

01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:35.999
What do we do?

01:05:36.416 --> 01:05:37.957
I don't trust them.

01:05:38.125 --> 01:05:41.874
What if they let him loose?
We can't allow that.

01:05:42.041 --> 01:05:43.665
God damn dandy...

01:05:43.916 --> 01:05:45.457
And those idiots!

01:05:46.291 --> 01:05:47.291
Come on!

01:05:47.375 --> 01:05:49.290
- We have to go inside!
- Come on!

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:51.082
Usue, help me.

01:05:53.708 --> 01:05:56.665
Usue?

01:06:04.708 --> 01:06:07.457
Forget about him
and tie up the blacksmith.

01:06:19.875 --> 01:06:21.665
Find out where the gold is.

01:06:23.083 --> 01:06:24.624
Where's the gold?

01:06:33.125 --> 01:06:34.125
Hey!

01:06:34.458 --> 01:06:35.458
Answer!

01:06:37.458 --> 01:06:38.707
Well?

01:06:45.958 --> 01:06:46.958
What?

01:06:52.166 --> 01:06:53.665
Bastard!

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.249
Listen, my friend,
do you want to make a deal?

01:07:31.833 --> 01:07:36.749
I can tell you where the gold is,
but first, help me get out of here.

01:07:38.375 --> 01:07:39.749
How embarrassing.

01:07:40.291 --> 01:07:41.291
What?

01:07:41.833 --> 01:07:44.415
Look at yourself, Sartael.

01:07:44.833 --> 01:07:46.665
How do you know my name?

01:07:47.125 --> 01:07:49.082
You look like a chicken.

01:07:49.541 --> 01:07:51.332
Shut up in that cage.

01:07:54.291 --> 01:07:55.707
Alastor?

01:07:57.041 --> 01:07:58.332
It's you!

01:08:00.833 --> 01:08:02.915
By the tail of Belfegor!

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.999
You finally found me!

01:08:06.458 --> 01:08:10.040
Come on, get me out of here
and I can finish the job.

01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:12.207
Little Sartael.

01:08:13.125 --> 01:08:14.457
Alastor.

01:08:15.250 --> 01:08:16.624
I haven't come for you.

01:08:16.957 --> 01:08:19.499
I've come for the blacksmith's soul.

01:08:20.082 --> 01:08:22.624
But I was asked
to report on your situation

01:08:23.332 --> 01:08:28.332
and to inform you that you've been
demoted for your negligence.

01:08:28.916 --> 01:08:30.374
Demoted?

01:08:30.750 --> 01:08:33.124
You're a disgrace to Hell.

01:08:34.250 --> 01:08:36.499
You've shown your true form
to the humans.

01:08:37.457 --> 01:08:39.665
You've broken protocol,

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:42.499
you've intervened physically
in their lives

01:08:42.916 --> 01:08:44.540
and you let yourself be captured.

01:08:45.750 --> 01:08:48.874
Everyone down below
was wondering where you'd got to.

01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:51.332
And as you know,

01:08:51.875 --> 01:08:55.749
our ministry never leaves loose ends.

01:08:56.666 --> 01:09:00.374
Give me a bit more time and I'll fix it!

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:02.165
The decision has been taken.

01:09:05.957 --> 01:09:08.624
And how far have I been demoted?

01:09:09.541 --> 01:09:11.124
Fifth Circle.

01:09:11.541 --> 01:09:15.499
The sad and repressed section,
boiling pot 203.

01:09:15.750 --> 01:09:18.499
No! No! No! No!

01:09:18.750 --> 01:09:21.290
Not the Sad! Please!

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:24.374
It's obvious
that tempting souls isn't your forte.

01:09:25.291 --> 01:09:28.124
It's beyond you.

01:09:29.125 --> 01:09:33.540
Each one has his place.
One's destiny is written.

01:09:36.291 --> 01:09:37.457
As soon as...

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.915
I deliver the report,
they'll come for you.

01:09:43.625 --> 01:09:46.457
Get me out of here somehow!

01:09:46.625 --> 01:09:48.499
And be implicated in your incompetence?

01:09:50.082 --> 01:09:51.457
Stay there,

01:09:51.791 --> 01:09:52.874
and learn.

01:09:55.625 --> 01:09:58.457
Observe those two
how they do what I want, obedient,

01:09:58.916 --> 01:10:01.249
without them knowing

01:10:01.958 --> 01:10:04.040
who I really am.

01:10:16.083 --> 01:10:18.165
Break the door down!

01:10:18.333 --> 01:10:19.457
Set fire to it,

01:10:19.958 --> 01:10:20.999
if necessary.

01:10:21.166 --> 01:10:22.207
Open the door!

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:26.040
- Open it, you bastards!
- Usue.

01:10:35.083 --> 01:10:36.124
That'll do.

01:10:37.958 --> 01:10:38.958
Well?

01:10:39.916 --> 01:10:40.916
Nothing.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.207
It's obvious that he's guilty.

01:10:44.958 --> 01:10:46.332
We have to hang him.

01:10:46.791 --> 01:10:48.624
But he hasn't said where the gold is.

01:10:49.041 --> 01:10:50.499
You'll still get paid.

01:10:50.916 --> 01:10:53.707
I don't understand.
Weren't we here for the gold?

01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:55.415
- Do as I say!
- But...

01:10:55.541 --> 01:10:56.874
I said, hang him!

01:10:58.916 --> 01:10:59.916
All right.

01:11:01.708 --> 01:11:02.790
Here's a rope.

01:11:13.166 --> 01:11:15.040
We can't break the door down.

01:11:33.291 --> 01:11:34.291
Little girl!

01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:36.291
Don't worry.

01:11:37.416 --> 01:11:39.957
Do you want to help the blacksmith?

01:11:42.125 --> 01:11:44.374
I can free him.

01:11:44.625 --> 01:11:45.915
Yes.

01:11:47.208 --> 01:11:52.124
And as well, if you help me, I swear
I'll look for your mother down below.

01:11:52.541 --> 01:11:54.207
I promise.

01:11:54.791 --> 01:11:55.791
Please!

01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:03.665
Just ring that damn bell.

01:12:04.708 --> 01:12:07.290
I'll keep them occupied

01:12:07.625 --> 01:12:09.207
while you get it.

01:12:09.625 --> 01:12:13.124
But then you have to help me
get out of here.

01:12:13.291 --> 01:12:14.291
Eh, little girl?

01:12:14.916 --> 01:12:16.457
Is it a deal?

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.915
Oh, Great Lord!

01:12:24.291 --> 01:12:25.540
You are right.

01:12:26.083 --> 01:12:29.790
This isn't the job for me.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.707
Who am I?
How can I compare with you?

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:37.499
Oh, Hangman,

01:12:38.291 --> 01:12:40.499
Grand Executioner...

01:12:40.666 --> 01:12:45.207
- Ignore him. Finish off the prisoner.
- Of the Infernal Monarch's sentences!

01:12:45.416 --> 01:12:48.874
Greater than Nemesis!

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.499
You're pathetic.

01:12:51.708 --> 01:12:53.415
Your words won't change your fate.

01:12:56.458 --> 01:12:57.999
Come on! Charge!

01:13:01.375 --> 01:13:02.375
Again!

01:13:08.958 --> 01:13:09.958
You!

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:11.500
You're here?

01:13:13.041 --> 01:13:15.082
Shake it!

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:45.500
Harder!

01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:57.290
He's a monster!

01:13:57.458 --> 01:13:59.415
- He's a monster!
- Little girl!

01:13:59.541 --> 01:14:02.457
Please! Get me out of here!

01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:04.540
We had a deal!

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.040
You have to get out of here.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:23.540
Hurry up!

01:14:25.958 --> 01:14:27.374
Quickly little girl, help me!

01:14:29.125 --> 01:14:30.125
Hurry up!

01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:39.457
No!

01:14:43.625 --> 01:14:47.624
I'm sorry, little girl,
but I'm never going back to hell.

01:14:51.125 --> 01:14:52.707
Get out of my way!

01:14:52.875 --> 01:14:54.874
Or I'll eat your souls!

01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:59.332
Don't let him escape!

01:15:14.041 --> 01:15:16.790
No! No! No!

01:15:16.958 --> 01:15:18.290
- Not again!
- A demon!

01:15:20.375 --> 01:15:21.874
Demon!

01:15:30.125 --> 01:15:33.290
You! Damn the day
I took you into my house!

01:15:33.791 --> 01:15:38.665
May the devil take you to hell
to join your whore of a mother!

01:15:58.791 --> 01:16:01.874
You come from Hell too, don't you?

01:16:02.666 --> 01:16:06.499
Can you take me there to my mother?

01:16:06.666 --> 01:16:08.915
Usue, keep away from him!

01:16:10.041 --> 01:16:12.124
Are you sure that's what you want?

01:16:15.125 --> 01:16:16.790
I'll take you to your mother.

01:16:17.625 --> 01:16:19.332
And you give me your soul in exchange.

01:16:21.208 --> 01:16:22.208
Is it a deal?

01:17:10.666 --> 01:17:12.999
No!

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:47.874
Usue!

01:17:49.833 --> 01:17:51.624
My little Usue!

01:17:54.291 --> 01:17:56.540
No! No!

01:17:57.250 --> 01:17:59.207
No!

01:17:59.875 --> 01:18:02.082
It was a demon.

01:18:03.916 --> 01:18:06.540
He took her to Hell.

01:18:21.916 --> 01:18:23.249
You win!

01:18:23.666 --> 01:18:25.249
Take me to Hell.

01:18:34.458 --> 01:18:35.458
What?

01:18:35.833 --> 01:18:37.707
Now you want to go?

01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:43.249
I'd rather be kicked by these idiots
than put up with you down there.

01:18:43.708 --> 01:18:45.999
The other demon took the little girl.

01:18:46.708 --> 01:18:47.790
A pity.

01:18:48.416 --> 01:18:51.082
I ended up liking her.

01:18:51.375 --> 01:18:53.290
But that's not my problem.

01:18:54.416 --> 01:18:58.040
You'd still be in that cage
if it wasn't for her.

01:18:59.125 --> 01:19:00.499
You owe it to her.

01:19:03.958 --> 01:19:05.374
Shit!

01:19:06.375 --> 01:19:07.499
All right!

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.499
But you'll go as my prisoner.

01:19:11.083 --> 01:19:12.083
Then let's go.

01:19:13.208 --> 01:19:14.208
Wait.

01:19:14.666 --> 01:19:17.332
You can't go with a stupid hand bell.

01:19:18.916 --> 01:19:20.624
A bell.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.249
The Carlist gold!

01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:49.124
It was right in front of us
all this time.

01:19:49.541 --> 01:19:52.165
Santi, there's the gold.

01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:53.832
This is our chance.

01:20:00.416 --> 01:20:01.416
Do you want the same?

01:20:05.416 --> 01:20:06.416
It'll work.

01:20:07.625 --> 01:20:08.625
Can you carry it?

01:20:09.958 --> 01:20:11.457
I suppose so.

01:20:26.291 --> 01:20:27.291
Come on.

01:20:29.041 --> 01:20:30.041
Do it!

01:20:30.833 --> 01:20:33.332
I'm going to enjoy this.

01:20:55.625 --> 01:20:56.832
What is this?

01:20:58.166 --> 01:20:59.415
Guess.

01:21:57.375 --> 01:21:59.665
Come on, forward!

01:21:59.833 --> 01:22:00.824
Come on!

01:22:00.991 --> 01:22:02.699
Welcome!

01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:13.499
I'm sorry, forgive me!

01:22:17.666 --> 01:22:18.957
Why did I do it?

01:22:19.125 --> 01:22:20.540
Come on! Go inside!

01:22:24.750 --> 01:22:26.207
Move!

01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:52.499
Welcome to Hell!

01:23:08.875 --> 01:23:09.999
Get back!

01:23:11.250 --> 01:23:12.540
Punish me!

01:23:12.791 --> 01:23:14.540
Get back in line!

01:23:14.708 --> 01:23:16.957
Human garbage!

01:23:17.125 --> 01:23:18.499
Yes, I'm scum.

01:23:29.958 --> 01:23:31.790
Do as I tell you.

01:23:38.791 --> 01:23:39.915
Sartael?

01:23:40.333 --> 01:23:41.457
Is that you?

01:23:41.958 --> 01:23:43.332
Orobas...

01:23:44.416 --> 01:23:46.832
Where have you been all this time?

01:23:47.250 --> 01:23:49.165
You look terrible.

01:23:49.708 --> 01:23:52.290
I heard you wouldn't be back.

01:23:52.541 --> 01:23:53.832
No, no...

01:23:54.375 --> 01:23:56.915
A difficult soul.

01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:58.500
That one there?

01:23:58.625 --> 01:24:00.624
He doesn't look so tough.

01:24:02.666 --> 01:24:05.040
Hey you! What have you got there?

01:24:16.958 --> 01:24:18.624
Stay where you are!

01:24:19.916 --> 01:24:22.624
Hey! There's a soul
here causing trouble.

01:24:41.916 --> 01:24:43.457
Get behind Sartael!

01:25:10.625 --> 01:25:11.625
Alastor!

01:25:12.458 --> 01:25:13.458
I'm out of here!

01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:41.707
Blacksmith!

01:25:44.333 --> 01:25:46.749
Get in there!

01:25:47.833 --> 01:25:49.207
I'm coming,

01:25:51.958 --> 01:25:53.499
but first count this.

01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:03.499
Ajar!

01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:10.082
Big mistake!

01:26:15.333 --> 01:26:16.499
Hey!

01:26:30.666 --> 01:26:31.957
Count them now!

01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:56.374
1, 2, 3,

01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:59.957
4, 5, 6,

01:27:00.750 --> 01:27:07.499
7, 8, 9, 10, 11...

01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:13.790
Don't close the gates, I'm garbage!

01:27:19.208 --> 01:27:21.957
20, 21,

01:27:22.291 --> 01:27:25.499
22, 23, 24...

01:28:06.208 --> 01:28:07.208
Sartael,

01:28:07.833 --> 01:28:09.374
get the girl out of here.

01:28:10.291 --> 01:28:11.457
I'm staying.

01:28:11.875 --> 01:28:16.374
Other bigger ones will be coming soon.

01:28:22.708 --> 01:28:24.624
I'm going to look for your mother.

01:28:50.208 --> 01:28:51.624
Get out of here.

01:29:37.125 --> 01:29:38.915
Let's go before I change my mind.

01:30:19.250 --> 01:30:20.290
Usue!

01:30:20.541 --> 01:30:22.249
My Lord Jesus!

01:30:23.208 --> 01:30:24.790
Thank you, Lord!

01:30:24.958 --> 01:30:26.540
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

01:30:27.416 --> 01:30:28.957
Yokels!

01:30:29.875 --> 01:30:33.999
This child is a saint
and they've thrown her out of Hell.

01:30:34.375 --> 01:30:38.957
Don't ever send her there again

01:30:39.791 --> 01:30:43.749
or I will eat your thumbs
while you sleep!

01:30:47.625 --> 01:30:48.625
Goodbye!

01:32:06.041 --> 01:32:07.165
Are you all right'?

01:32:17.375 --> 01:32:20.707
- Thank you, good man.
- Don't mention it, friend.

01:32:21.333 --> 01:32:23.082
May I ask what happened to you?

01:32:24.625 --> 01:32:26.124
You wouldn't believe it.

01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:29.415
It's a long way to the next town.

01:32:29.708 --> 01:32:32.749
And I love a good story.

01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:36.082
Well, I know a good one.

01:32:36.541 --> 01:32:38.499
I'm all ears.

01:32:40.333 --> 01:32:46.874
This story, like many others,
begins with a man of flesh and blood...

01:32:51.791 --> 01:32:53.540
Let me in!

01:33:07.833 --> 01:33:10.624
A man so evil,

01:33:12.125 --> 01:33:13.749
so cruel

01:33:16.041 --> 01:33:19.790
that even the devil himself
would fear him.

01:33:21.083 --> 01:33:23.249
A blacksmith.

01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:29.874
And whether it was so or not,

01:33:30.208 --> 01:33:32.124
get into the pumpkin,

01:33:32.291 --> 01:33:35.374
and out at the square.

01:38:28.958 --> 01:38:35.124
THE END
