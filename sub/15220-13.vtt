00:58.687 --> 01:01.857
And so, Dr Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,

01:01.857 --> 01:04.735
striving to put right
what once went wrong

01:04.735 --> 01:08.572
and hoping each time
that his next leap...

01:08.572 --> 01:10.616
will be the leap home.

01:26.751 --> 01:28.837
Activate the time machine.

01:31.005 --> 01:33.633
Stand by the time accelerator.

01:36.094 --> 01:38.388
Uh...uh...

01:38.388 --> 01:40.890
Standing...by.
Activate...

01:40.890 --> 01:42.934
now!

01:50.942 --> 01:52.986
Oh, boy.

03:08.394 --> 03:12.982
Hold on, Future Boy. We seem to be
experiencing a lot of cosmic
turbulence today.

03:14.108 --> 03:16.527
You'd better deploy
the anti-asteroid shields.

03:16.527 --> 03:18.988
What?
The asteroid shields.

03:18.988 --> 03:21.199
They're next to
the thermal reactor switch.

03:21.199 --> 03:24.535
Thermal reactor switch?
The red button on the end.

03:28.247 --> 03:31.834
Disengage...time activator.

03:31.834 --> 03:34.337
Disengaging time activator.

03:34.337 --> 03:36.464
Now!

03:44.514 --> 03:46.182
Let's take a look at the future.

03:59.153 --> 04:02.907
Agh! Future Boy! Your equilibrium
must've been all shook up

04:02.907 --> 04:05.118
because of all of that
cosmic turbulence.

04:05.118 --> 04:07.578
Are you OK, Future Boy? Are you OK?

04:07.578 --> 04:09.664
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.
Oh, good. Good.

04:09.664 --> 04:11.833
Ow! Ow!

04:11.833 --> 04:14.001
Right.

04:14.001 --> 04:16.796
Let's activate
our shields of invisibility.

04:18.464 --> 04:20.757
So we can't be detected
by any futuristic

04:20.757 --> 04:23.136
lifeforms. Ready?

04:24.220 --> 04:26.347
Activate...now!

04:26.347 --> 04:28.224
(SQUEAKS AND RUMBLES)

04:30.226 --> 04:31.227
Psst! Psst!

04:33.312 --> 04:35.440
Psst!

04:35.440 --> 04:37.316
Golly, Captain Galaxy.

04:37.316 --> 04:39.986
(STILTINGLY) Where the heck are we?

04:39.986 --> 04:43.781
This sure doesn't look like
any place I've seen before.

04:44.907 --> 04:46.868
(BOTH READ AT ONCE)

04:46.868 --> 04:49.829
According to my uh...gyrograph...

04:51.664 --> 04:53.458
Yes.

04:55.668 --> 04:58.254
We are aboard
a futuristic cruise ship

04:58.254 --> 05:02.800
in the year...1987.

05:04.552 --> 05:06.721
(1987.)

05:06.721 --> 05:09.140
Leaping lizards.
That means we've jumped

05:09.140 --> 05:11.476
30 years...into the future.

05:11.476 --> 05:14.061
(That makes this '57.)
That's right, Future Boy.

05:14.061 --> 05:16.439
Now. Let's explore the spaceship

05:16.439 --> 05:18.608
so that we can give our time cadets

05:18.608 --> 05:21.152
an opportunity to see
what the future...

05:21.152 --> 05:24.280
holds in store...for them.

05:24.280 --> 05:26.574
Great idea, Captain Galaxy.

05:26.574 --> 05:28.743
I say that, if they try to invade,

05:28.743 --> 05:30.870
we give them a dose of
their own gamma rays

05:30.870 --> 05:32.997
and reduce them to neutrons.
(LAUGHS)

05:37.543 --> 05:40.421
(STILTINGLY)
Holy smokin' retro rockets,

05:40.421 --> 05:43.925
Captain Galaxy. Is this the way
that things are going to be

05:43.925 --> 05:45.760
in the future?

05:48.471 --> 05:50.640
This is not the future, time cadets.

05:50.640 --> 05:54.477
Only one man's distorted view of it.

05:54.477 --> 05:57.271
Oh, my God. You're doing it again!

05:58.397 --> 06:01.025
(GIVES AN INDISTINCT ORDER)

06:01.025 --> 06:04.195
It will be a time of great
social and technical advancement.

06:04.195 --> 06:06.989
We will see an end of disease,
war and hunger.

06:06.989 --> 06:09.033
Isn't that right, Future Boy?

06:10.868 --> 06:13.037
Uh...uh...

06:13.037 --> 06:15.790
Yes. Yes, that's right...

06:15.790 --> 06:17.917
Captain Galaxy. And...

06:17.917 --> 06:20.336
it may be a bumpy flight, but...

06:21.420 --> 06:24.006
working together, mankind...

06:24.006 --> 06:27.134
will take a giant leap

06:27.134 --> 06:29.136
closer to the things
you're describing.

06:30.263 --> 06:32.390
But there'll always be
more things to do.

06:32.390 --> 06:34.600
Well said, Future Boy.

06:34.600 --> 06:37.478
No problem
is too difficult to solve.

06:37.478 --> 06:41.565
As long as we remember to
ask ourselves the right questions.

06:41.565 --> 06:43.776
And speaking of questions.

06:43.776 --> 06:47.822
Let's take a look at today's
spacemail before we
time-leap out of here.

06:47.822 --> 06:49.865
Here we go, Future Boy.

06:58.332 --> 07:00.376
The letter, Future Boy.

07:02.128 --> 07:04.463
Please hand it to Captain Galaxy.

07:05.589 --> 07:07.675
Thank you. Thank you.

07:07.675 --> 07:12.513
Now. Today's letter is from little
Davy Chase of Cheyenne, Wyoming.

07:12.513 --> 07:14.682
And Davy writes,

07:14.682 --> 07:18.394
Dear Captain Galaxy. If you
and Superman got into a fight,

07:18.394 --> 07:20.563
who would win?

07:20.563 --> 07:23.274
Well, Davy.
Captain Galaxy and Superman

07:23.274 --> 07:25.401
would never get into a fight.

07:25.401 --> 07:28.237
First, because we're good friends.

07:28.237 --> 07:31.574
And second, because violence
doesn't solve a thing.

07:31.574 --> 07:35.035
But thank you for your letter.
And remember to tune in tomorrow,

07:35.035 --> 07:37.079
when Captain Galaxy...

07:38.914 --> 07:42.543
And Future Boy. ..blast off
for another adventure in time.

07:42.543 --> 07:45.171
Until then, I'll see you...

07:45.171 --> 07:47.882
in...the future!

07:52.636 --> 07:55.097
We're clear.
(TWO RINGS OF AN ALARM-LIKE BELL)

07:55.097 --> 07:57.683
What the hell do you think
you're doing out here?

07:57.683 --> 08:01.103
That was stupid. Who told you to
do that stunt? I didn't write that.

08:01.103 --> 08:04.356
Well, I uh...
Has the whole world gone crazy?!

08:04.356 --> 08:06.817
Just because the Russians
put a satellite in space

08:06.817 --> 08:09.028
doesn't mean you two
get to go into orbit too!

08:09.028 --> 08:12.782
I don't want these kids growing up
thinking the future holds
only violence.

08:12.782 --> 08:15.117
Don't be ridiculous.
Kids love violence.

08:15.117 --> 08:16.952
Because we tell them to love it.

08:16.952 --> 08:20.289
We...should be teaching them
to dream.

08:20.289 --> 08:23.584
To see the future for its
possibilities, not its limitations.

08:23.584 --> 08:26.003
When you...write me
a script like that,

08:26.003 --> 08:28.923
I will shout it...from the rooftops.

08:30.966 --> 08:33.928
I swear, I... I swear,
if the kids didn't love him, I...

08:33.928 --> 08:36.096
You talk to him.

08:36.096 --> 08:38.182
You tell him, any more screw-ups,
he's gone.

08:38.182 --> 08:40.392
Kids or no kids! You got it?

08:41.519 --> 08:43.562
Got it.

08:47.107 --> 08:49.193
Hey, Kenny.

08:49.193 --> 08:51.320
I got you some ice for your ankle.

08:51.320 --> 08:53.489
Oh. Oh, thanks. I appreciate that.

08:53.489 --> 08:55.616
Yeah. How is it?

08:55.616 --> 08:57.743
Uh, it...it's OK.

08:57.743 --> 08:59.870
All right. I'll see you later.

08:59.870 --> 09:01.914
All right. OK. Thanks.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.944
I don't believe this.

09:45.499 --> 09:47.626
Born to play the role...

09:47.626 --> 09:50.296
Stein is incandescent as Macbeth.

09:50.296 --> 09:52.548
In a towering performance,

09:52.548 --> 09:55.801
the actor makes all who came
before him pale in comparison.

09:55.801 --> 09:58.262
Unbelievable.
(DOOR OPENS) I thought so too.

09:58.262 --> 10:00.431
A long time ago.

10:00.431 --> 10:02.641
But that's bad luck.
Bad luck?

10:02.641 --> 10:05.269
You mentioned the Scottish play.

10:07.479 --> 10:09.606
I'm sorry. But...

10:09.606 --> 10:12.735
This is great.
You've had an unbelievable career.

10:12.735 --> 10:14.903
I mean, Mac-

10:14.903 --> 10:17.740
The...Scottish play?
Right.

10:17.740 --> 10:20.325
Uh...Hamlet, Othello.

10:20.325 --> 10:22.536
Captain uh...Galaxy (!)

10:23.871 --> 10:27.041
Well... Hey. Nobody can say
you don't have range. Right?

10:27.041 --> 10:29.668
That hurt?
Well...it's just a little sore.

10:29.668 --> 10:31.545
Not as sore as Ben Harris.

10:31.545 --> 10:34.089
I hope you didn't let him
get to you back there.

10:34.089 --> 10:37.926
No. I just don't think he likes you
changing his dialogue. Dialogue?

10:37.926 --> 10:40.220
Shakespeare wrote dialogue.

10:40.220 --> 10:43.140
Ben Harris writes 'television' (!)

10:44.266 --> 10:46.268
Aren't you afraid
of losing your job?

10:46.268 --> 10:50.272
It doesn't matter. I won't be here
that much longer anyway.

10:50.272 --> 10:52.274
Where are you going?
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

10:53.484 --> 10:55.527
To the door.

10:58.322 --> 11:00.449
Dad?
Irene! I just wanted -

11:00.449 --> 11:03.452
How come you can never find
a time machine when you need one?

11:03.452 --> 11:05.954
Aren't you gonna let her in?

11:05.954 --> 11:08.415
Dad! We need to talk!

11:08.415 --> 11:11.710
There's a peculiar grating tone
to her voice. Don't you think?

11:13.879 --> 11:15.547
Dad!

11:25.432 --> 11:27.726
Don't tell me. Let me guess.

11:28.852 --> 11:32.064
You've been invited to
a costume party...

11:32.064 --> 11:35.108
and you're going as
a baked potato (!)

11:42.282 --> 11:45.619
What happened to your leg?
I just twisted my ankle a little.

11:45.619 --> 11:47.746
You did?
What...what happened?

11:47.746 --> 11:50.332
Huh? What do you mean?
Somebody die?

11:50.332 --> 11:53.335
Did somebody d-
Oh. Oh, you mean my suit. Oh.

11:53.335 --> 11:55.671
No. No. I have to
make a court appearance.

11:55.671 --> 11:57.881
My third wife is suing me... No.

11:57.881 --> 11:59.841
Fourth? Fifth? My fourth wife

11:59.841 --> 12:01.969
is suing me for
more alimony payments

12:01.969 --> 12:05.597
and the lawyer says it'd be better
if I appeared a little...

12:05.597 --> 12:07.641
Grown up.

12:08.934 --> 12:12.187
No, boring. Which nobody could
accuse you of being.

12:12.187 --> 12:15.190
What's the FB stand for?
Future Boy.

12:17.359 --> 12:19.486
Future Boy?!
(LAUGHS)

12:19.486 --> 12:22.739
That's good. You think I'm bad,
wait till you see my partner.

12:22.739 --> 12:26.243
Captain Galaxy. I bet he looks like
another small potato.

12:26.243 --> 12:28.328
(LAUGHS)
Where am I, Al?

12:28.328 --> 12:30.455
All right. Yeah.

12:30.455 --> 12:32.624
Uh... Oh, St Louis.

12:32.624 --> 12:34.626
October...
1957.

12:34.626 --> 12:37.671
How'd you know that?
I'm Future Boy. Remember (?)

12:39.298 --> 12:42.676
Actually...you are a young act.

12:42.676 --> 12:44.803
Or...

12:44.803 --> 12:46.930
Actor.

12:46.930 --> 12:49.141
Young actor named Kenny Sharp.

12:49.141 --> 12:52.602
October 6th.
We just missed the Sputnik launch!

12:52.602 --> 12:54.730
You should've leapt in two days ago.

12:54.730 --> 12:56.898
Al, what am I here to do?

12:56.898 --> 13:00.193
Race a speeding bullet? Leap over
a building in a single bound?

13:00.193 --> 13:03.739
Well, according to Ziggy,
there's a 96.2% chance

13:03.739 --> 13:08.952
you're here to save the life of
another act...or named Moe Stein.

13:11.913 --> 13:15.500
Captain Galaxy?
What happens to him?

13:15.500 --> 13:18.920
Well, sometime after
twelve noon tomorrow,

13:18.920 --> 13:23.550
he apparently gets killed trying to
hop a southbound freight train.

13:24.926 --> 13:27.054
Hop a train?

13:27.054 --> 13:29.890
Oh, come on, Al. That's ridiculous.

13:29.890 --> 13:33.060
I mean, wait till you see this guy.
There's no way he could hop a...

13:33.060 --> 13:36.730
OK. Even if that's what happens,
this is great. This is an easy leap.

13:36.730 --> 13:39.691
All I gotta do is keep him away
from the train yards. No.

13:39.691 --> 13:43.320
Ziggy says the only way
you can save this...Moe

13:43.320 --> 13:47.449
is by having him committed
to a mental institution.

13:53.911 --> 13:56.080
Oh, come on, Al.

13:56.080 --> 13:58.249
I'm not gonna leap in here
to save a guy's life

13:58.249 --> 14:01.001
and then watch him be thrown into
a mental institution.

14:01.001 --> 14:03.045
Now, that is insane.

14:04.171 --> 14:06.549
Well, maybe he's crazy.
Oh, come on!

14:06.549 --> 14:08.718
He's 65 years old.

14:08.718 --> 14:13.305
I mean, who in his right mind is
gonna start riding the rails at 65?

14:13.305 --> 14:16.183
You would - if there were
a cute girl on board.

14:16.183 --> 14:18.352
Oh. Yeah, well...

14:18.352 --> 14:20.688
Yeah.
I would. But according to Ziggy,

14:20.688 --> 14:23.357
his daughter tries
to get him committed,

14:23.357 --> 14:26.026
he runs out on the hearing
and that's when he gets killed.

14:26.026 --> 14:28.195
Well, that proves that he's sane.

14:28.195 --> 14:30.865
Because only an insane person
would calmly sit by

14:30.865 --> 14:32.992
and watch himself be committed.
Right?

14:32.992 --> 14:35.953
Well...maybe he gets committed
for his own protection.

14:35.953 --> 14:39.748
No. Al, come on. We don't know
that this guy is crazy.

14:39.748 --> 14:41.959
Right? I mean, look at me.

14:41.959 --> 14:45.504
I'm standing here,
dressed like a giant TV dinner,
talking to a hologram.

14:45.504 --> 14:47.715
Now, what does that make me?

14:47.715 --> 14:51.177
Eccentric.
And maybe that's what Moe is.

14:51.177 --> 14:54.889
Maybe he's the kinda guy
who just marches to the tune of
a different drummer.

14:54.889 --> 14:57.016
We all know people like that.

14:57.016 --> 14:59.185
You and I both do. It's not a crime.

14:59.185 --> 15:01.312
Dad? I am talking to you!

15:01.312 --> 15:03.439
Will you come back here?

15:03.439 --> 15:05.774
Maybe the real problem
is not with him.

15:05.774 --> 15:08.402
Maybe the real problem is with Irene.

15:08.402 --> 15:11.697
I'm going to have to talk to Dr -
No doctors, Irene!

15:11.697 --> 15:13.741
I'm not gonna talk to any doctor!

15:16.118 --> 15:19.288
Look. Another 24 hours
and everything would've been OK.

15:19.288 --> 15:22.458
Now, look. Would you take her
outside, buy her a soda?

15:22.458 --> 15:25.044
Just give me enough time
to get out of here. And Kenny?

15:25.044 --> 15:27.171
I'll let you read
the spacemail tomorrow.

15:27.171 --> 15:30.007
Now, come on. Do me this favour.
Just buy her a small one.

15:30.007 --> 15:31.759
Good.

15:31.759 --> 15:33.802
That's it.

15:39.308 --> 15:42.895
Hello.
Who are you? Kid Comet (?)

15:45.564 --> 15:47.691
No. No, I'm uh...

15:47.691 --> 15:49.902
I'm Kenny Sharp.

15:49.902 --> 15:53.614
I play Future Boy on uh...
your dad's show.

15:53.614 --> 15:55.783
It's Mrs Kiner.

15:55.783 --> 15:59.370
And I don't know what the two of you
are up to, but it's not gonna work.

16:00.496 --> 16:03.207
Uh...Mrs Kiner? I'm sure that...

16:03.207 --> 16:05.584
your father would like to
talk to you more, but...

16:05.584 --> 16:07.795
right now he's feeling
a little indisposed.

16:07.795 --> 16:10.381
My father has been indisposed
for over 30 years.

16:10.381 --> 16:12.508
And I am not gonna
put up with it any longer.

16:12.508 --> 16:14.635
You think the answer
is to have him committed?

16:16.428 --> 16:19.264
I don't want to.
I just don't have any choice.

16:19.264 --> 16:21.684
You could leave him alone.

16:21.684 --> 16:23.727
Kenny...

16:24.812 --> 16:27.147
My father is a sick man.

16:27.147 --> 16:29.692
He may not look it, but he is.

16:29.692 --> 16:31.652
You see, Sam? I told you.

16:31.652 --> 16:34.363
Look. All he did was
change a few words in a script.

16:34.363 --> 16:37.783
Two months ago,
he lost control of his car.

16:37.783 --> 16:41.370
It jumped a kerb, crashed through
a fence and nearly ended up
in a fountain.

16:41.370 --> 16:44.373
He was day-dreaming.
It's lucky nobody was killed.

16:44.373 --> 16:46.875
Could've just been an accident.

16:46.875 --> 16:49.586
Two months earlier, I got a call
in the middle of the night

16:49.586 --> 16:51.714
because he'd almost
burnt down his house.

16:51.714 --> 16:55.092
I drove ten hours from Milwaukee
to get here.

16:55.092 --> 16:58.679
Turns out he was distracted.
He had left some soup on the stove.

16:59.763 --> 17:01.890
Mrs Kiner?

17:01.890 --> 17:04.059
Mrs Kiner.

17:04.059 --> 17:06.395
If you feel someone
should watch your father,

17:06.395 --> 17:11.066
maybe it should be
someone from his own family,
instead of an institution.

17:11.066 --> 17:14.569
That's impossible. I don't have
a relationship with my father. We...

17:14.569 --> 17:16.613
(SIGHS)

17:18.449 --> 17:20.701
I don't know why
I'm telling you this.

17:20.701 --> 17:23.119
Maybe because I'm listening.

17:28.584 --> 17:31.879
When I was a kid growing up,
it was like I didn't have a father.

17:32.963 --> 17:36.508
He was always out on the road doing
a play or a film or something.

17:37.885 --> 17:41.138
The only contact we had
was with penny postcards or...

17:41.138 --> 17:43.223
collect phone calls.

17:43.223 --> 17:45.309
Must've been rough.

17:46.351 --> 17:48.437
When I was 17, my mother died.

17:50.522 --> 17:53.650
She loved my dad...
even after all he put her through.

17:55.486 --> 17:59.239
But before she died, she made me
promise that I'd take care of him.

17:59.239 --> 18:01.783
By putting him in an institution?

18:01.783 --> 18:05.996
I have my own family now. I can't
be responsible for him any more.

18:05.996 --> 18:08.415
Look. I'm sure
he didn't mean to hurt you.

18:08.415 --> 18:10.667
He didn't even come home
for her funeral.

18:11.752 --> 18:13.837
Gee. That's kinda low, isn't it?

18:14.880 --> 18:17.007
Look. Maybe at the time...

18:17.007 --> 18:19.301
it was too painful for him.

18:19.301 --> 18:21.970
I mean, maybe he felt so guilty...

18:21.970 --> 18:24.681
about not being there
for so long that...

18:24.681 --> 18:28.185
that to come home then for your
mom's funeral would've been wrong.

18:28.185 --> 18:30.562
He still should've come.
You're right.

18:30.562 --> 18:32.606
And I know you're angry.

18:33.690 --> 18:35.859
But sometime in your life...

18:35.859 --> 18:37.903
you have to find a way to let go.

18:39.238 --> 18:41.323
For yourself.

18:41.323 --> 18:43.408
And then maybe sometime...

18:44.451 --> 18:46.286
..you can find a way to start over.

18:49.456 --> 18:51.500
I think you're getting to her, Sam.

18:53.043 --> 18:55.921
Hey, Kenny.
I've been looking all over for you.

18:55.921 --> 18:58.131
You've got a live spot to do.

18:58.131 --> 19:02.010
Ben's gone crazy. He said if you
aren't back in five minutes, don't
come back at all.

19:02.010 --> 19:04.429
Well, don't let her go.
Will you just wait here?

19:04.429 --> 19:07.057
I'll just be a couple of minutes.
Come on, Kenny!

19:07.057 --> 19:11.311
We don't have anything else to talk
about. Just make sure he gets this.

19:11.311 --> 19:13.563
You give it to him.
Maybe you can catch him.

19:13.563 --> 19:17.317
I don't know why you're so concerned
about what's up with me and
my father, but...

19:17.317 --> 19:19.444
it's really none of your business.

19:19.444 --> 19:22.197
So...just leave me alone.

19:24.074 --> 19:26.076
Come on, man!

19:31.039 --> 19:33.959

Come on, come on. Turn him around!

19:41.591 --> 19:43.719
Turn him around!

19:43.719 --> 19:46.096
Give him the box. 
Come on. Come on!

19:46.096 --> 19:48.140
Give him the box!

19:49.391 --> 19:52.894

could see you know.

Well, it's most likely an order

20:57.709 --> 21:00.712
Apparently, Moe didn't show up

21:00.712 --> 21:05.675
for a meeting with a court-appointed
doctor named Dr Sandler
for an evaluation.

21:05.675 --> 21:08.762
And that pretty much
settled the case in his hearing.

21:08.762 --> 21:12.724
OK. So we just get Moe
to meet with this Dr Sandler
and prove he's not crazy.

21:12.724 --> 21:15.227

I'm not talking about
changing his spots, Al.

21:17.521 --> 21:20.148
I'm just trying to make him
a little more presentable.

21:32.077 --> 21:35.330
To keep Moe out of trouble, I was
going to have to change his image.

21:35.330 --> 21:37.541

I wasn't sure
changing the spots on a leopard

21:42.504 --> 21:45.590
might not be easier
than making Moe appear...normal.

or is she lurking somewhere outside?

No, no.

22:37.309 --> 22:39.477
She's worried about you, though.

22:39.477 --> 22:42.272
She told me about the...

Einstein was crazy.

But they didn't uh...
try to lock him up.

22:50.655 --> 22:53.116
Listen. Moe,
I know you're not crazy.

22:53.116 --> 22:57.579
But why don't you just meet with
this Dr Sandler so he knows it too?

22:57.579 --> 22:59.706
I don't need to meet a doctor.

you'll have to face this thing.

23:07.839 --> 23:09.591
Time is not gonna stand still.

23:13.720 --> 23:15.930
I wanna show you something.

23:15.930 --> 23:18.767
When I was young, my uh...
passion was trains.

23:18.767 --> 23:20.977
I couldn't get enough of them.

23:20.977 --> 23:24.397
I even memorised their timetables.
I do the same thing.

23:24.397 --> 23:26.649
Whenever anything went bad,
I would just...

23:26.649 --> 23:30.236
imagine that I could jump on a train
and go anywhere I wanted to,

23:30.236 --> 23:32.530
to any time I wanted to.

23:32.530 --> 23:35.241
But now...I've got something
better than a train.

23:39.412 --> 23:41.498
I've got a time-onometer.

23:43.458 --> 23:45.835
What is it?
It's a time machine.

23:45.835 --> 23:48.505
Uh...you're sure it doesn't
make cappuccino (?)

23:49.631 --> 23:52.759
When I started playing
Captain Galaxy, I became fascinated

23:52.759 --> 23:55.595
with the thought of actually
being able to travel in time.

23:55.595 --> 23:57.764
I began to read
everything I could about it.

23:57.764 --> 24:00.225
Heisenberg's theory of indeterminacy.

24:00.225 --> 24:02.977
Planck's hypothesis
of discrete units.

24:02.977 --> 24:05.605
Einstein's theory of relativity.

24:05.605 --> 24:08.817
Yeah, but when you say time machine,
you mean a time machine like...

24:08.817 --> 24:10.860
like on your show, right?

24:10.860 --> 24:12.987
The show? No, no, no. That's fantasy.

24:12.987 --> 24:15.114
This is real.

24:15.114 --> 24:17.033
Look.

24:21.538 --> 24:24.666
Time...is like...a piece of string.

24:25.750 --> 24:28.753
One end of the string is birth,
the other is death.

24:30.171 --> 24:32.298
You put them together...

24:32.298 --> 24:35.093
and your life is a loop.

24:35.093 --> 24:37.303
Sam, that's your theory!

24:37.303 --> 24:39.973
If I can travel fast enough
along the loop,

24:39.973 --> 24:44.227
I will eventually end up
back at the beginning of my life.

24:44.227 --> 24:46.354
He's almost got it.

24:46.354 --> 24:48.940
Uh...well, let me ask you.

24:48.940 --> 24:51.067
What would happen if uh...

24:51.067 --> 24:53.111
you would ball the string, right?

24:54.362 --> 24:56.406
And then each day of your life...

24:57.490 --> 24:59.659
..would touch another day.

24:59.659 --> 25:01.828
And then...

25:01.828 --> 25:05.623
you could travel from one place
on the string to another,

25:05.623 --> 25:09.460
thus enabling you to move back
and forth within your own lifetime.

25:09.460 --> 25:11.546
Maybe.
That's it.

25:11.546 --> 25:13.715
That's it!

25:13.715 --> 25:16.384
Then I could actually -
Quantum leap?

25:19.262 --> 25:21.431
Quantum leap.

25:21.431 --> 25:24.684
I like that.
I like that a lot.

Captain Galaxy wings?

25:36.548 --> 25:38.717

27:04.219 --> 27:06.054
How about you?

27:06.054 --> 27:08.640
Can you really travel back in time?

27:08.640 --> 27:10.476
Yes, son. I can.

27:10.476 --> 27:12.978
Could you go back two weeks?

27:12.978 --> 27:16.732
We can go anywhere at any time.

27:16.732 --> 27:20.152
Could you go back
and lock the gate at my house

27:20.152 --> 27:22.738
so my dog won't get out
and get killed?

27:30.370 --> 27:33.665
Yes. Yes, Captain Galaxy
could do that.

27:33.665 --> 27:36.710
In fact...about a week ago...

27:36.710 --> 27:40.339
we were on one of our
time travel...trips

27:40.339 --> 27:43.008
and we stopped off in Doggy Heaven.

27:43.008 --> 27:45.219
What is your dog's name?

27:45.219 --> 27:47.471
Tiger.
Tiger.

27:47.471 --> 27:50.265
Tiger. I think we saw...
We met a Tiger.

27:50.265 --> 27:52.851
And Tiger had a message for you.
And the message was...

27:54.102 --> 27:56.230
He's very happy.

27:56.230 --> 27:58.357
And he misses you.

27:58.357 --> 28:01.235
And...it doesn't hurt.

28:03.111 --> 28:05.822
And speaking...of happy,

28:05.822 --> 28:08.408
what do you say if
for the next two hours

28:08.408 --> 28:13.247
all the popcorn and soda...is free!

28:13.247 --> 28:15.707
ALL: Yeah!

28:15.707 --> 28:18.752
He-hey! He-hey!

28:23.757 --> 28:25.926
I should've told him the truth.

28:25.926 --> 28:28.053
I should've told him
I'd close the gate.

28:28.053 --> 28:30.222
But that wouldn't
have been the truth.

28:30.222 --> 28:32.683
It would've been
by this time tomorrow.

28:32.683 --> 28:37.104
Moe. You've gotta stop talking about
this time-onometer stuff.

28:37.104 --> 28:39.189
Why? Because of Irene
and that doctor?

28:39.189 --> 28:41.400
Yes! Now, I want you to meet him.

28:41.400 --> 28:43.610
Just talk to him, OK?
I'll go with you.

28:43.610 --> 28:45.487
We can call Irene.

28:45.487 --> 28:47.281
That won't be necessary.

28:47.281 --> 28:49.449
Irene. Moe was just telling me

28:49.449 --> 28:52.202
how much he was looking forward
to meeting with

28:52.202 --> 28:55.372
Dr...Scanlon.
Sandler. Sandler.

28:55.372 --> 28:57.874
Right.
Is that true?

28:57.874 --> 29:00.836
No. I'd rather have a tooth drilled
without Novocaine.

29:00.836 --> 29:03.005
But he's still willing
to give it a shot.

29:03.005 --> 29:06.967
Trust me. Besides, in a day,
you'll be gone. So what do you care?

29:06.967 --> 29:08.427
OK.

29:08.427 --> 29:10.595
Fine.

29:10.595 --> 29:14.057
Good. I'll see
if he's available tonight.

29:14.057 --> 29:16.393
We'll meet him in his office.
No, no office.

29:16.393 --> 29:18.854
I won't be treated like
some sort of crackpot.

29:18.854 --> 29:22.065
OK. All right. What do we say
we get a neutral site?

29:22.065 --> 29:24.985
How about dinner at some restaurant?
My house.

29:24.985 --> 29:27.112
No!
OK.

29:28.697 --> 29:30.741
No problem.

29:35.162 --> 29:37.539
Thank you for this meal
we are about to receive.

29:39.499 --> 29:41.626
Amen.

29:41.626 --> 29:43.754
Well. This is all...

29:43.754 --> 29:45.881
very...

29:45.881 --> 29:48.008
very, very nice.

29:48.008 --> 29:50.135
And...I think...

29:50.135 --> 29:52.262
not everybody realises
how hard it is

29:52.262 --> 29:54.389
to whip up such a meal
on such short notice.

29:54.389 --> 29:57.267
Don't you agree, Dr Sandler?
This is very impressive.

29:57.267 --> 30:00.187
I can hardly wait to see
what Moe's made for us.

30:02.731 --> 30:04.775
It's a chicken.

30:05.942 --> 30:08.862
An upside down chicken.
It's an old family recipe.

30:22.417 --> 30:26.963
Mr Stein. At the risk of
offending my own dear mother,
God rest her soul,

30:26.963 --> 30:32.552
that is the finest
roast chicken I have ever had.
It is so moist and tender.

30:32.552 --> 30:36.014
(LAUGHS)
It's all in uh...your bird...

30:36.014 --> 30:37.432
placement.

30:40.101 --> 30:42.103
(LAUGHS)

30:42.103 --> 30:44.272
Bird placement!

30:44.272 --> 30:46.566
I'll have to remember that.
(ALL LAUGH)

30:50.195 --> 30:52.239
(LAUGHING CONTINUES)

30:53.907 --> 30:55.909
Anybody want any coffee?
I'd love some.

30:55.909 --> 30:58.453
I'll help you.
(ALL TALK AT ONCE)

30:58.453 --> 31:00.580
No, no. That's all right.

31:00.580 --> 31:02.707
The doctor and I can manage.

31:02.707 --> 31:04.751
Thank you. Let me get your plate.

31:06.419 --> 31:08.421
After you, Doctor.
Thank you.

31:10.257 --> 31:12.300
(Moe, Moe!)

31:16.471 --> 31:18.515
He's doing pretty good, don't you -

31:25.897 --> 31:28.024
Nice picture.

31:28.024 --> 31:30.068
Oh.

31:33.363 --> 31:35.407
We had a few good moments.

31:37.158 --> 31:40.328
Whenever he'd come home from
the road, he'd always bring lilies.

31:44.124 --> 31:46.293
He's doing great, don't you think?

31:46.293 --> 31:49.212
An upside down chicken
is not my idea of doing great.

31:49.212 --> 31:52.674
Can't you at least give him credit
for trying? Is that what you want?
No.

31:52.674 --> 31:55.260
No, I want you to hold off
on this hearing.

31:55.260 --> 31:58.096
Spend some time with him. It's not
too late to get to know him.

31:58.096 --> 32:00.265
I already know him.

32:00.265 --> 32:02.684
And I can't keep spending my life
worrying that

32:02.684 --> 32:06.521
every time the phone rings
it's somebody calling to say
he's hurt himself.

32:06.521 --> 32:08.857
He loves you, you know.

32:08.857 --> 32:10.984
Did he tell you that?
Well...

32:13.653 --> 32:17.115
No. But...he wants to.

32:17.115 --> 32:19.784
What, with postcards?
Irene...

32:19.784 --> 32:21.870
your dad loves you.

32:21.870 --> 32:24.039
And I think you love him too.

32:24.039 --> 32:27.208
You're just too...full of the past
to realise it.

32:27.208 --> 32:29.169
You don't know
anything about my past.

32:29.169 --> 32:32.047
I know that if you don't stop
feeling sorry for yourself,

32:32.047 --> 32:33.882
you'll never get to know your dad.

32:35.759 --> 32:39.095
It's not too late. Let's
take a look at your time machine.

32:39.095 --> 32:42.140
Well, it's not real pretty.
I was never much for design.

32:42.140 --> 32:44.559
Well, this could be very interesting.

32:48.355 --> 32:50.565
Wow! Well!

32:51.983 --> 32:55.320
Where are you gonna go in this...
time-onometer of yours?

32:55.320 --> 32:57.697
Anywhere. Any time.

32:57.697 --> 32:59.824
Backwards, forwards.

32:59.824 --> 33:01.951
Long trips or short.

33:01.951 --> 33:04.079
Well, what do you mean uh...

33:04.079 --> 33:06.289
short trips?

33:06.289 --> 33:08.875
Let's say it's uh...
it's Friday at 8:00.

33:08.875 --> 33:12.420
And you want to go back to
Wednesday at 10:00,

33:12.420 --> 33:15.256
because you missed your favourite
television programme.

33:15.256 --> 33:17.467
(CLANKING)

33:17.467 --> 33:19.552
Away you go.
Dad.

33:19.552 --> 33:21.721
Shut this thing off!

33:21.721 --> 33:24.015
Don't worry, honey.
I'm just charging the cap-

33:24.015 --> 33:26.059
(BANG, AND IRENE SCREAMS)

33:27.852 --> 33:30.021
Moe? Come on, Moe.

33:30.021 --> 33:32.065
(SECOND BANG,
AND IRENE SCREAMS AGAIN)

33:32.065 --> 33:34.192
Turn this thing off!

33:34.192 --> 33:36.361
I can't. It's on internal power.

33:36.361 --> 33:39.197
(SERIES OF SMALL EXPLOSIONS)
Leave me alone!

33:39.197 --> 33:41.825
Leave me alone!

33:41.825 --> 33:43.868
(FURTHER EXPLOSIONS)

33:51.292 --> 33:53.419
Yes, well.

33:53.419 --> 33:55.505
I think I've seen enough (!)

34:05.640 --> 34:09.018
Oh, what have we got here?
A new breed of guard dog?

34:09.018 --> 34:11.396
At least she didn't
take the shirt off your back.

34:11.396 --> 34:13.982
No, no. She dropped her demands.

34:13.982 --> 34:16.109
How did you manage that?

34:16.109 --> 34:18.862
Well, let's say we...

34:18.862 --> 34:23.032
examined each other's briefs
and decided to call it even.

34:23.032 --> 34:25.159
How'd it go with the doctor?

34:25.159 --> 34:27.536
Great. Till he blew up the basement,

34:27.536 --> 34:30.039
nearly taking Sandler, Irene
and me with him.

34:30.039 --> 34:33.167
You see? Maybe it'd be safer
if he was put away. No.

34:33.167 --> 34:36.129
Now, listen. I don't know why
I didn't think of this earlier.

34:36.129 --> 34:38.172
Moe is me.

34:38.172 --> 34:40.632
You mean, woe is me.
No.

34:40.632 --> 34:43.594
Back when I started
Project Quantum Leap,

34:43.594 --> 34:47.181
the government tried to shut me down
because they thought I was crazy.

34:47.181 --> 34:49.183
But I wouldn't let 'em.
YOU wouldn't. Why?

34:50.893 --> 34:54.230
Because we believe in our work.
But that time machine of his
is loony.

34:54.230 --> 34:56.357
It's a 2,000lb toaster!

34:56.357 --> 34:59.110
It doesn't matter. The point is,
Moe believes in his work.

34:59.110 --> 35:00.987
And he's on the right track.

35:00.987 --> 35:04.407
He's just 40 years ahead of his time.
But he still gets killed.

35:04.407 --> 35:07.702
So you've gotta put him away, Sam.
I'm not giving up, Al.

35:07.702 --> 35:11.623
I got a plan.
Hi, Kenny.

35:11.623 --> 35:14.125
Oh...sorry I'm late.

35:14.125 --> 35:15.960
This plan I gotta see.

35:15.960 --> 35:19.339
What do you think you're doing?
I was just repairing the machine.

35:19.339 --> 35:21.758
Don't worry.
The damage was only superficial.

35:21.758 --> 35:25.053
I'm not talking about that.
I mean that! Oh. It's a pyramid hat.

35:25.053 --> 35:27.889
It generates positive energy.
Moe.

35:27.889 --> 35:30.058
You just don't get it, do you?

35:30.058 --> 35:34.187
These people wanna lock you up,
put you away. That won't happen.

35:34.187 --> 35:36.731
How do you know?
Because I'm not crazy.

35:36.731 --> 35:40.360
Besides, the machine's ready to go
and I'm leaving after the hearing.

35:40.360 --> 35:43.112
Just wanted to say goodbye.
Should've hired you a lawyer.

35:44.238 --> 35:47.450
I want you...to argue my case.
What?

35:49.827 --> 35:51.871
I can't. I mean...

35:53.498 --> 35:56.834
I'm...I'm just an actor.
So?

35:56.834 --> 35:58.878
You'll act. Like a lawyer.

35:59.962 --> 36:01.464
Moe.

36:10.840 --> 36:13.051
So in conclusion, and after much
careful consideration,

36:13.051 --> 36:16.596
it is my professional opinion that
Mr Stein would be best served

36:16.596 --> 36:19.349
by his enrolment
in a mental institution.

36:21.606 --> 36:23.775
Enrolment?

36:23.775 --> 36:26.194
Sounds like they're gonna
send Moe to college.

36:27.320 --> 36:31.991
Mrs Kiner, I know this is a
difficult question for you to answer.

36:31.991 --> 36:35.912
But...do you believe your father
needs psychiatric care?

36:38.498 --> 36:43.211
Well, he...almost burnt down
his house two months ago.

36:43.211 --> 36:46.798
And there has been...
irrational public behaviour.

36:47.966 --> 36:50.343
And he almost
blew himself up last night.

36:50.343 --> 36:52.679
Blew himself up?

36:52.679 --> 36:55.848
He was experimenting with
a time machine in his basement.

36:55.848 --> 37:00.186
Your Honour, what a person builds
in the privacy of their own basement
has nothing to do -

37:00.186 --> 37:02.772
Mr Sharp. As Future Boy,

37:02.772 --> 37:05.149
I'm sure you've already seen
in your crystal ball

37:05.149 --> 37:07.819
that I am gonna give you
an opportunity to speak.

37:07.819 --> 37:09.821
So you don't mind waiting for it,
do you?

37:11.614 --> 37:14.284
No, sir.

37:18.496 --> 37:20.665
Crystal ball!

37:20.665 --> 37:22.834
And they think I'm nuts!

37:22.834 --> 37:26.504
Your Honour, I don't think my father
is in touch with reality any more.

37:26.504 --> 37:28.631
And I'm afraid he's gonna get hurt.

37:28.631 --> 37:30.717
Thank you.

37:32.010 --> 37:34.053
Now, Mr Sharp.

37:35.388 --> 37:37.515
Thank you, Your Honour.

37:37.515 --> 37:40.226
Uh...

37:41.853 --> 37:44.689
Mrs Kiner. You were telling me
that when you were young

37:44.689 --> 37:46.816
your father was away from home a lot.

37:46.816 --> 37:48.943
How did you feel about that?

37:50.278 --> 37:53.823
Well, I...I would've liked
it to be different,
if that's what you mean.

37:53.823 --> 37:58.369
But I don't think that's -
You promised your dying mother
that you would take care of your dad.

37:59.537 --> 38:03.041
Well...yes. But I don't think
that that's what this is about.

38:03.041 --> 38:05.001
I have a responsibility here.

38:05.001 --> 38:07.712
God - he almost killed us all
last night.

38:07.712 --> 38:11.966
Your Honour, Mr Stein was simply
conducting a scientific experiment.

38:11.966 --> 38:14.177
You can't call that crazy. I mean...

38:14.177 --> 38:16.304
Was Columbus crazy?

38:16.304 --> 38:18.473
Or...or the Wright brothers?

38:18.473 --> 38:21.225
Neil Diamond?
Armstrong! Armstrong.

38:21.225 --> 38:24.687
Who? The first man to set foot
on the moon, knuckle-nose!

38:24.687 --> 38:27.106
Oh, sorry.
You didn't know about that.

38:28.191 --> 38:30.318
The point is...

38:30.318 --> 38:32.487
Mr Stein is not insane.

38:32.487 --> 38:34.822
What about that thing
in the basement?

38:34.822 --> 38:37.950
You don't actually believe
he can travel in time, do you?

38:41.454 --> 38:42.622
Well...

38:43.831 --> 38:45.875
What I'm trying to say there...

38:49.003 --> 38:51.631
I got six more out in the car.
Great. Thanks.

38:51.631 --> 38:53.716
Your Honour.

38:53.716 --> 38:57.553
A man is judged to be insane
if he behaves outside
the norms of society.

38:57.553 --> 38:59.931
But who is society? We are.

38:59.931 --> 39:03.059
Plus the thousands upon thousands
who work and live around us.

39:03.059 --> 39:07.271
Now these...are just simply
some of the fan letters

39:07.271 --> 39:10.775
that Captain Galaxy, Moe Stein,
gets every day.

39:10.775 --> 39:14.570
Everyone who writes one of these
letters believes that
Captain Galaxy,

39:14.570 --> 39:17.198
Moe Stein, can travel in time.

39:17.198 --> 39:20.826
Society believes the same thing
that Moe Stein does.

39:20.826 --> 39:24.413
So, either thousands of people
in society are crazy...

39:25.456 --> 39:27.792
..or Moe Stein is sane.

39:29.544 --> 39:34.006
Now, I do admit that Mr Stein
did try to build a time machine.

39:34.006 --> 39:36.592
But if you had sat there
12 years ago

39:36.592 --> 39:40.805
and told me the Russians
would be the first ones to orbit
a satellite around the Earth,

39:40.805 --> 39:43.683
I would've called you crazy.
But two days ago, they did it.

39:43.683 --> 39:45.476
So, who's to say that...

39:45.476 --> 39:48.813
12 years from now say, 1969,

39:48.813 --> 39:51.857
maybe men will be
walking on the moon.

39:51.857 --> 39:55.903
Or maybe...Moe Stein
will be travelling in time.

39:57.947 --> 39:59.740
Your Honour.

40:01.742 --> 40:03.786
Moe Stein is a dreamer.

40:05.079 --> 40:07.206
Are we gonna punish people for that?

40:07.206 --> 40:09.250
Because if we are...

40:10.584 --> 40:13.045
..you're gonna need
a much bigger room than this.

40:14.422 --> 40:16.549
Good, Sam. That was pretty neat.

40:16.549 --> 40:18.592
Good.

40:21.220 --> 40:23.347
Mr Stein.

40:23.347 --> 40:25.599
Mrs Kiner.

40:25.599 --> 40:30.062
It is a painful moment in any family
when a division arises within it.

40:30.062 --> 40:32.606
It's also a painful moment
for the court

40:32.606 --> 40:34.692
when it is invited
to decided such matters.

40:35.776 --> 40:38.279
However...here we are.

40:40.281 --> 40:42.783
And, although
Mr Stein appears to be rational

40:42.783 --> 40:45.327
and in control of his faculties,

40:45.327 --> 40:47.997
there is evidence
that he may pose a threat

40:47.997 --> 40:50.041
to himself and others.

40:51.709 --> 40:55.671
Therefore, I'm going to
recommend that he be confined
for further evaluation

40:55.671 --> 40:57.715
at Timothy Psychiatric Hospital.

40:57.715 --> 41:00.926
For six months.
Term to begin immediately.

41:00.926 --> 41:04.096
You can't do that.
I'm leaving in a few hours.

41:04.096 --> 41:06.640
Don't you understand?
I'm doing this for you.

41:06.640 --> 41:09.060
Dad, you need help.
Dr Sandler.

41:09.060 --> 41:11.187
Would you be so kind as to escort

41:11.187 --> 41:14.023
Mr Stein to Timothy?
Certainly, Your Honour.

41:14.023 --> 41:16.567
Come along, then.
Don't touch me!

41:16.567 --> 41:19.111
Moe. We can figure this out.
I promise. No.

41:19.111 --> 41:21.655
I won't let them lock me up.
I've got too much to do.

41:21.655 --> 41:23.783
Don't worry.
Everything is going to be OK.

41:23.783 --> 41:26.410
Agh!
Mr Stein, get down from there!

41:26.410 --> 41:28.704
Moe. Come on. Don't do this.

41:28.704 --> 41:31.749
No. I have to.
I'll see you in the future.

41:37.671 --> 41:40.090
Moe!

41:40.090 --> 41:42.259
What the hell is he doing?

41:42.259 --> 41:44.678
He's going to get killed.
No. No.

41:44.678 --> 41:47.181
He's not going to the train yard.
He's going home.

41:47.181 --> 41:49.934
Have the police pick him up.
No! Listen.

41:49.934 --> 41:52.686
You say you wanna help him.
Now's your chance to prove it.

41:53.979 --> 41:56.106
It's your call. Mrs Kiner.

41:56.106 --> 41:58.234
My car's out front.
Let's go.

42:03.989 --> 42:06.116
Oh, my God, you were right!

42:06.116 --> 42:08.160
He's gonna kill himself.

42:12.498 --> 42:16.460
Sam, hurry up, before he
turns himself into a French fry!

42:16.460 --> 42:19.213
Moe, get outta there!
Why are you doing this?

42:19.213 --> 42:21.298
Sorry, honey.
I'm gonna fix everything.

42:21.298 --> 42:23.425
Moe, come on! Now, get outta there!

42:23.425 --> 42:25.594
Daddy?

42:25.594 --> 42:28.097
(MACHINE NOISE INCREASES)
I love you!

42:37.690 --> 42:39.858
(ENGINE WINDS DOWN)

42:51.787 --> 42:53.956
Of all the times it didn't work.

43:02.673 --> 43:04.717
It didn't work.

43:07.761 --> 43:09.805
All these years I...

43:11.056 --> 43:13.100
It didn't work.

43:17.479 --> 43:19.606
I wanted to...

43:19.606 --> 43:21.859
to change things.
I wanted to make it up to you.

43:23.402 --> 43:25.654
I wanted to give your mother
some lilies.

43:26.864 --> 43:28.907
What are you talking about?

43:33.620 --> 43:35.748
When this was written...

43:35.748 --> 43:38.083
your mother was pregnant with you.

43:39.209 --> 43:41.378
I was just about to...

43:41.378 --> 43:44.548
give up the business...
settle down.

43:44.548 --> 43:46.925
And then you got that?
All of a sudden,

43:46.925 --> 43:50.179
these offers started pouring in -
national tours, revivals.

43:50.179 --> 43:52.848
The next thing I knew,
30 years had gone by.

43:52.848 --> 43:55.225
Well, I want those 30 years back!

43:55.225 --> 43:57.895
That's why you built this machine.

44:00.356 --> 44:02.358
Crazy, huh?
(LAUGHS)

44:03.484 --> 44:06.570
An actor...in search of
a bad review.

44:08.822 --> 44:12.326
But I figured if I could
change that one moment...

44:13.786 --> 44:15.829
..I could change it all.

44:18.165 --> 44:20.292
I could've been the father...

44:20.292 --> 44:22.336
I never was.

44:24.505 --> 44:26.548
The husband I should've been.

44:27.633 --> 44:29.676
We could've been a family.

44:32.096 --> 44:34.139
Oh, Daddy, we are a family.

44:36.141 --> 44:39.311
We've got lots of time
to make up for all those things.

44:45.776 --> 44:47.820
Can I give you these?

44:50.030 --> 44:52.157
Oh, Daddy!

44:52.157 --> 44:53.867
I love you!

44:56.537 --> 44:58.580
I love you too, Irene.

44:59.665 --> 45:01.416
I love you very, very much.

45:09.508 --> 45:11.844
Well, I see that we're
just about out of time.

45:12.928 --> 45:15.264
But...before we sign off today,

45:15.264 --> 45:17.307
I'd like to make an announcement.

45:18.433 --> 45:20.769
Captain Galaxy is going away
for a while.

45:22.938 --> 45:25.065
He's going back to see...

45:25.065 --> 45:27.192
if he can find something...

45:27.192 --> 45:29.695
he lost a long time ago.

45:29.695 --> 45:33.323
But before we sign off,
we have time for one last letter.

45:35.701 --> 45:37.870
How come you're not out there?

45:37.870 --> 45:41.373
Oh, I figured that he deserved to
answer the last letter by himself.

45:44.042 --> 45:46.128
Yes.
Guess I was here to...

45:46.128 --> 45:48.255
get them together, huh?

45:48.255 --> 45:51.758
Yeah, well, Ziggy had a...
sloppy floppy on this one.

45:51.758 --> 45:53.969
But it all worked out, didn't it?

45:53.969 --> 45:56.680
Yeah. What happens to 'em?
He goes to live with Irene,

45:56.680 --> 45:59.474
spends the rest of his life
entertaining the local kids

45:59.474 --> 46:02.060
with tales of the future.

46:02.060 --> 46:04.229
Today's letter is from...

46:04.229 --> 46:07.399
little Sam Beckett
in Elk Ridge, Indiana.

46:07.399 --> 46:09.526
Sam writes...

46:09.526 --> 46:11.695
Dear Captain Galaxy.

46:11.695 --> 46:15.240
Could you please explain
your theory of time travel to us?

46:16.325 --> 46:18.869
Well, Sam. Our lifetimes...

46:18.869 --> 46:21.496
are like a piece of string.

46:21.496 --> 46:23.665
But...

46:23.665 --> 46:27.711
if you roll...the string...
up into a ball...

46:29.004 --> 46:31.256
..all the days of your life...

46:39.598 --> 46:41.641
♪ DISCO TRACK

46:54.237 --> 46:58.784
OK, ladies! Let's hear it
for the star of The Chippendales!

46:58.784 --> 47:01.995
Rod...the Bod!
