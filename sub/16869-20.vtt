BARRY: Previously on The Flash...

00:03.800 --> 00:05.723
<i>Next time you decide to release
my friend's inner ice demon,</i>

00:05.920 --> 00:07.001
<i>you do it sometime in July.</i>

00:07.200 --> 00:08.645
I was trying to save her life, Cisco.

00:08.840 --> 00:10.444
When I became Killer Frost,

00:10.640 --> 00:13.484
<i>Savitar appeared to me
and showed me the way.</i>

00:13.680 --> 00:14.761
If the answers that we need

00:14.960 --> 00:17.167
<i>to stop Samar and save you
are 'm the future,</i>

00:17.360 --> 00:18.327
<i>then that's where I need to go.</i>

00:18.520 --> 00:20.522
You trapped Savitar in the Speed Force.

00:20.720 --> 00:21.767
Just tell me how you did it.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.161
- I had help.
-Help from who?

00:23.360 --> 00:25.249
A physicist. Her name is Tracy Brand.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.164
I know who you are.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.001
(PANTS)

00:50.520 --> 00:51.521
-(LAUGHS)
-Cecile,

00:51.720 --> 00:55.850
most people quit
their New Year's resolutions by now.

00:56.080 --> 00:57.081
Uh-uh.

00:57.360 --> 01:00.489
Central City Marathon is in two months,
and I've got to shave...

01:01.160 --> 01:04.687
Oh! I've still got half a minute
I've got to take off my time. You?

01:04.879 --> 01:06.689
A lot more than 30 seconds.

01:06.920 --> 01:11.562
Look, I am going to wait for you
at the end of the marathon.

01:11.800 --> 01:13.529
No, you're not pulling out of this thing.

01:13.760 --> 01:17.890
I am not as easy with running
as some other members of my family.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.646
I'm gonna let it slide. I'm gonna let it.

01:20.840 --> 01:21.807
- Yeah?
-Yeah. Yeah.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.081
Are you getting mad?

01:23.280 --> 01:24.520
(LAUGHING)

01:24.720 --> 01:27.371
I would never get mad.
I love you too much to be mad.

01:30.600 --> 01:34.844
Uh... Yeah. That's... I...

01:35.040 --> 01:36.007
I didn't really mean to--

01:36.240 --> 01:37.241
- No, absolutely, it's--
-(CELL PHONE VIBRATES)

01:37.440 --> 01:39.169
I was looking at you, and it came out,
and I don't want you

01:39.360 --> 01:40.646
-to feel uncomfortable.
-I'm sorry. Sorry. Hold on.

01:41.040 --> 01:43.281
- Sorry, I've got to take this.
-Yeah, yeah. Yeah, go for it.

01:43.480 --> 01:45.687
Yeah? Okay, I'm on my way.

01:46.560 --> 01:47.721
Yeah.

01:48.280 --> 01:50.601
Sorry. I've got to head out.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.331
Her name is Tracy Brand.

01:58.520 --> 02:00.727
She's one of the world's
top theoretical physicists.

02:00.920 --> 02:02.410
You know, or at least, she will be.

02:02.640 --> 02:05.166
No kidding.
Girl Scout earns her merit badges.

02:05.360 --> 02:09.330
2021 Nobel Prize,
Copley Medal, presidential commendation...

02:09.560 --> 02:11.050
She's a genius. What's that to us?

02:11.240 --> 02:13.447
She's the key to stopping Savitar.

02:13.640 --> 02:15.483
Future me said that four years from now,

02:15.680 --> 02:18.047
Dr. Brand invents the technology
that traps Savitar in the Speed Force.

02:19.440 --> 02:20.441
Four years too late?

02:20.640 --> 02:22.005
Yeah, but if she invents the tech then,

02:22.240 --> 02:23.844
then maybe she's working
on the prototype now.

02:24.080 --> 02:26.606
That's exactly right,
so we should find her.

02:26.800 --> 02:28.131
Agreed.

02:29.680 --> 02:32.684
Sorry, why are we not looking
for Caitlin, again?

02:33.280 --> 02:35.851
Easy, Romeo and Julian.
None of us have forgotten about Caitlin.

02:36.040 --> 02:39.567
Right, but Future Flash already confirmed
that she teams up with Savitar.

02:39.800 --> 02:42.406
We should be doing everything in our power
to stop that from happening.

02:42.640 --> 02:43.607
- We know.
-We know.

02:43.800 --> 02:46.690
Right, so what is Wally doing swanning off
to Earth-3 to be with his girlfriend?

02:46.880 --> 02:48.609
He could be here right now
looking for her!

02:48.800 --> 02:50.928
- It's like no one's doing a thing!
- CISCO: <i>No</i> one's <i>doing</i> a <i>thing?</i>

02:51.120 --> 02:53.361
Barry and Wally searched the city
half a dozen times.

02:53.560 --> 02:54.527
No one's doing a thing?

02:54.720 --> 02:56.484
Every chance I get,
I try to vibe where she is.

02:56.680 --> 02:58.489
We're using facial recognition technology.

02:58.680 --> 03:00.205
We're using the meta-human app,
the satellite.

03:00.400 --> 03:02.482
- We're doing everything we can.
-I just wanna her back, okay?

03:02.680 --> 03:04.409
Yeah, well,
if you wanted her here so badly,

03:04.600 --> 03:05.806
maybe you shouldn't have ripped off
that necklace

03:06.000 --> 03:07.445
-and turned her into a killer.
- BARRY: <i>Okay.</i>

03:07.640 --> 03:09.165
- Okay. All right.
-CISCO: Just saying.

03:09.360 --> 03:10.486
(COMPUTER BEEPS)

03:10.680 --> 03:12.011
We got a hit.

03:12.200 --> 03:15.409
Tracy Brand, currently enrolled
in C.C.U.'s Theoretical Physics program.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.602
So our hopes
of defeating an evil speed god

03:17.840 --> 03:19.808
-hinge on a grad student?
-Yep.

03:20.360 --> 03:22.203
Could be worse.
B.A., Cisco, let's do this.

03:23.080 --> 03:24.730
Let's go.

03:28.160 --> 03:31.084
CISCO: Ah... The soul-sucking
fluorescence of academia.

03:31.280 --> 03:32.441
Yeah, this is exciting, though.

03:32.640 --> 03:34.483
It's like meeting Norbert
before he was Einstein.

03:34.680 --> 03:36.444
- Albert.
-Norbert, Albert...

03:36.640 --> 03:38.051

03:51.800 --> 03:53.689
- I had it under control.
-(LOUD WHISTILING)

-Okay, you know what?

03:55.760 --> 03:57.728
Let's put this down
while you still have your eyebrows?

03:57.960 --> 03:59.200
Did you set the fire on purpose?

03:59.400 --> 04:00.811
Yes, I'm burning everything.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.570
(BARRY STUTTERS)

04:02.800 --> 04:03.801
- What?
-Everything? What--

04:04.000 --> 04:06.321
My work.
Well, I don't know why they call it "work"

04:06.520 --> 04:08.249
because none of it works.

04:08.440 --> 04:10.602
Well, this isn't exactly what I expected.

04:10.800 --> 04:11.926
Me, neither.

04:12.320 --> 04:15.210
- Dr. Brand?
-Oh, no, just Tracy.

04:15.440 --> 04:16.805
I failed my dissertation.

04:17.360 --> 04:21.046
Nothing like 10 years down the drain
and a pile of debt as a legacy.

04:21.279 --> 04:24.568
Tracy, we were just hoping
that you'd have a moment to talk.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.286
Oh, no, my bus leaves in five minutes.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.608
Oh, please tell me
I didn't burn my bus ticket.

04:30.120 --> 04:32.600
That's hot.
Your bus... Where are you going?

04:32.800 --> 04:34.564
Big Belly Burger. I hear they're hiring.

04:34.760 --> 04:38.560
(SNORTS) What, you're...
What about all your research?

04:38.760 --> 04:42.401
Oh. No, you mean my "unsubstantiated
and transactional inquiry

04:42.600 --> 04:45.604
"into the purely suppositional nature
of extra-dimensional energy"?

04:46.000 --> 04:46.967
- Yes.
-Yeah.

04:47.160 --> 04:49.606
A waste of time, or as Dr. Hersh puts it,

04:49.800 --> 04:52.724
"a total misapplication
of the university's resources."

04:52.920 --> 04:55.366
I might as well start practicing,
"Do you want fries with that?"

04:55.600 --> 04:56.681
- Yes.
-No.

04:56.880 --> 04:57.961
- B.A.
-BARRY: Stop.

04:58.160 --> 04:59.764
Look, don't let the naysayers
get you down.

04:59.960 --> 05:02.884
Your doubts, they're traitors.
Don't believe them.

05:03.080 --> 05:06.209
Your mind is too fine to waste
turning tubers into finger chups.

05:06.760 --> 05:08.125
- Finger chips?
-Finger chups, it's like a--

05:08.320 --> 05:09.446
- He's from out of town. H.R.
-Stop.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.449
Look, you can't give up.

05:11.640 --> 05:13.449
Your work
on relativistic quantum mechanics

05:13.640 --> 05:15.529
and its application to interspatial theory

05:15.720 --> 05:19.361
to manipulate matter on a subatomic level,
it's ground-breaking.

05:19.840 --> 05:23.845
I haven't shared that hypothesis
with anyone other than my therapist.

- Yeah. That's gonna leave a mark.
-Come. Come on.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.727
- Caitlin's after Tracy.
-BARRY: Yeah.

06:30.920 --> 06:32.251
That means she's working with Savitar.

06:44.880 --> 06:47.531
That's definitely her, Detective,
icy eyes and all.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.845
(SIGHS) Yeah, that's her.

06:54.640 --> 06:57.883
So I'm gonna spread this around
so everyone knows to look for her.

06:58.080 --> 06:59.969
- Can you give me one second?
-Mmm-hmm.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.890
All right.
So, if Caitlin wants Tracy dead,

07:04.080 --> 07:06.560
I guess what you saw in the future
was true.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.569
She's teamed up with Savitar.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.410
I just didn't think
it was gonna happen this soon.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.409
It certainly makes things
more complicated.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.045
Makes what more complicated?

07:14.280 --> 07:16.567
Uh... There was a meta-attack at C.C.U.,

07:16.760 --> 07:20.446
and we just don't have much to go off of.

07:20.640 --> 07:23.405

Isn't there video footage?

07:23.600 --> 07:25.921
Uh... No, it got erased.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.931

you two will figure it out.

No, no, no, I didn't feel pressured.

07:46.560 --> 07:49.564
Okay, so we're good?

07:50.040 --> 07:51.121
- We're great.
-Great.

07:51.360 --> 07:52.521
Okay. Um...

07:53.400 --> 07:56.483
In that case, good luck with your meta.

08:01.720 --> 08:04.690
Um... So I totally heard that.
Do you wanna talk?

08:04.920 --> 08:06.251
No. Hey, where are you going?

08:06.480 --> 08:07.891
Oh, nearest bus stop.

08:08.080 --> 08:11.402
No, you should stay here. Um...
With Detective West for a little bit.

08:11.640 --> 08:14.007
Why? That sketch artist
was like freaking Michelangelo,

08:14.200 --> 08:15.201
and you've got your woman.

08:15.400 --> 08:18.370
Not yet, and until we do,
you could be in a lot of danger.

08:18.600 --> 08:21.331
You really think Jack Frost's sister
wants to kill me? I'm no one.

08:21.560 --> 08:23.244
In my experience,
if she's come after you once,

08:23.440 --> 08:24.726
she's likely to do it again.

08:24.920 --> 08:28.447
Look, this whole witness-overprotection
thing is totally unnecessary.

08:28.680 --> 08:29.920
- It was just a random attack.

08:30.080 --> 08:31.923
Oh, the bus is coming. I've got to go.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.928
We need to keep an eye on her.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.010
Yeah, we do.

08:43.360 --> 08:44.521
She got away.

08:44.720 --> 08:48.042
I told you exactly where she'd be.

08:48.240 --> 08:49.765
Barry and Cisco were there when I arrived.

08:50.040 --> 08:52.122
As I told you they would be.

08:52.360 --> 08:57.287
Maybe there's more Caitlin Snow inside you
than you led me to believe.

08:57.520 --> 08:59.648
Are you saying I let her go on purpose?

08:59.880 --> 09:00.961
Did you?

09:01.640 --> 09:04.610
You call yourself Killer Frost,

09:04.800 --> 09:07.724
but you haven't actually killed
anyone yet.

09:08.400 --> 09:11.324
You and I can both be gods,

09:11.560 --> 09:14.245

09:14.760 --> 09:19.971
All you have to do is kill the girl.

09:25.400 --> 09:28.131
Okay. Look, I might not have any cash,

09:28.320 --> 09:32.325
but I have one of those Jitters cards
that has 10 stamps on it,

09:32.560 --> 09:34.927
which means you owe me a free drink. Okay?

09:41.600 --> 09:42.931

-Mmm.

lead to principle causality

10:41.200 --> 10:43.043
Lay off the French,
and lay off the improv, too, please?

10:43.320 --> 10:44.401
Just keep her talking.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.648
Ah, thank you, Misha.

10:48.320 --> 10:50.209
- Please, the Zoom.
-Thank you.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.004
- You're welcome.
-Let's zoom.

10:52.400 --> 10:56.928
Mate, was it just me, or did it sound
like H.R. was trying to flirt?

10:57.400 --> 10:59.164
Hmm. Didn't notice.

10:59.720 --> 11:02.087
Listen, the security footage today
from C.C.U.,

11:02.320 --> 11:06.245
the stuff that we wiped
to protect Caitlin's identity? I saw it.

11:07.040 --> 11:10.522
As in I saw the two of you squaring off.

11:11.080 --> 11:12.161
Okay.

11:13.520 --> 11:14.885
Well, from the angle that I saw,

11:15.080 --> 11:17.606
it looked like
you had a pretty clear shot.

11:18.520 --> 11:19.567
Okay.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.922
You had a clear shot, Cisco,
and you didn't take it. Why?

11:24.200 --> 11:26.123
Julian, I'm trying to focus on
what we're here to focus on.

11:26.360 --> 11:28.044
I suggest you do the same.

11:30.040 --> 11:31.769
Gents, how we doing?

11:32.440 --> 11:33.601
Uh, all good.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.807
- I don't know about this one, Barr.
-(SIGHS)

11:40.040 --> 11:41.724
H.R. isn't exactly our best closer.

11:41.920 --> 11:43.365
He'll be fine.

11:45.440 --> 11:48.364
- Are you okay?
-Yeah, just--

11:49.040 --> 11:50.246
<i>BARRY: Cecile?</i>

11:52.360 --> 11:56.285
(SIGHS) She's just...
She caught me off-guard.

11:56.560 --> 11:59.882
- Mmm-hmm.
-Just didn't think we were there yet.

12:00.240 --> 12:02.049
Well, obviously, she is.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.648
<i>Are you'?
-I care for her a lot.</i>

12:05.800 --> 12:11.409
It's just, with everything going on
with Iris and Savitar

12:11.600 --> 12:16.845
and now Caitlin, just feel
like I lie to Cecile all the time.

12:17.080 --> 12:18.491
<i>Then maybe you should stop.</i>

12:18.920 --> 12:22.641
You're gonna have to tell her about Wally
and me and all this at some point, right?

12:22.920 --> 12:24.410
So why not now?

12:25.920 --> 12:28.651
Well, just so you know, you don't have
to keep her in the dark for us.

12:28.840 --> 12:31.286
If you love her,
you should be honest with her.

12:31.760 --> 12:33.967
At least, that's what you'd tell me to do.

12:38.480 --> 12:40.005
Okay, so here's the thing

12:40.280 --> 12:42.521
that I could never get them
to understand at the university.

12:42.680 --> 12:43.761
See...

12:45.160 --> 12:47.322
- Yeah?
-I've been studying speedsters.

12:47.520 --> 12:48.521
Uh-huh.

12:49.120 --> 12:50.360
And so you know how, when they run,

12:50.520 --> 12:52.124
they generate
a trail of lightning behind them?

12:52.320 --> 12:53.685
Right. Lightning.

12:53.840 --> 12:56.525
I don't think all of that is generated
by them running.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.364
- I think--
-No?

12:58.880 --> 13:01.008
Some of it comes from somewhere.

13:01.320 --> 13:04.483
- Mmm-hmm.
-Like some sort of a... Like a...

13:04.720 --> 13:06.848
Speed Force?

13:08.720 --> 13:11.690
- Yeah. Wait. That is a great term for it.
-(CHUCKLES)

13:11.880 --> 13:13.041
-"Speed Force."
-Well, thanks.

13:13.280 --> 13:15.362
Anyway, so I've been doing
some calculations.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.321
I think there might be
a way to manipulate it.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.847
- Mmm-hmm.
-Maybe even control it.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.004
Maybe even turn it into a prison.

13:26.480 --> 13:27.891
Maybe. Um, yeah.

13:28.160 --> 13:30.049
Yeah. Just a random thought.

13:30.320 --> 13:31.890
How do you think
one would accomplish that?

13:32.080 --> 13:33.081
- See, I don't know.
-Okay.

13:33.240 --> 13:35.402
Because the university
wouldn't fund my research.

13:36.640 --> 13:41.931
Why are you so interested in this?
Because everybody thinks I'm a crackpot.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.367
I certainly don't think you're a crackpot.

13:58.440 --> 13:59.680

So, what, you're Savitar's lackey now?

14:36.080 --> 14:38.811
More fun to reign in hell, and all that.

14:45.480 --> 14:47.289
All right.
I'm gonna get her to head back this way.

14:47.480 --> 14:49.608
When she does, you've got
to knock her out, okay? Okay?

14:49.800 --> 14:50.801
Yeah.

Now, Cisco!

16:28.400 --> 16:31.085

This is where
the Flashy Flash goes to, huh?

16:51.080 --> 16:54.402
It's not exactly what I imagined,
but it's cool.

16:54.600 --> 16:55.761
So I always wondered how you kept

16:55.960 --> 16:59.407
the friction from building up
a lethal dose of static charge.

16:59.720 --> 17:04.089
Yeah, that's vulcanized Teflon.
it neutralizes any electron imbalance.

17:04.440 --> 17:08.444
Okay, and the White Witch?
I'm guessing you know why she's after me?

17:08.760 --> 17:12.002
Well, she's teamed up
with an evil speedster from the future,

17:12.240 --> 17:13.844
and, apparently,
you develop the technology

17:14.079 --> 17:17.402
to trap him for an eternity, so...

17:17.960 --> 17:19.450
You can't be serious.

17:20.119 --> 17:21.246
Totally serious.

17:21.599 --> 17:23.329
An evil speedster?

17:23.599 --> 17:24.761
He calls himself Savitar.

-"Savitar," and he's from the future?
-IRIS WEST: Yep.

17:27.760 --> 17:29.808
- And I build a trap for him? Me?
-You.

Killer Frost after you.

17:34.080 --> 17:36.811
"Killer Frost"? Her name is Killer Frost?

17:37.000 --> 17:38.809
- H.R.: Yeah.
-We know it's a lot to take in.

17:38.960 --> 17:42.646
Well, to be fair, you're basically
telling me I'm Sarah Connor in Terminator.

17:42.800 --> 17:45.201
- More like--
-Well, Miles Dyson.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.124
Yeah. But good effort, though.

17:47.320 --> 17:50.210
So, wait.
You're telling me my ideas about the...

17:50.440 --> 17:52.010
The Speed Force.

17:52.160 --> 17:55.642
Speed Force, being able to control it,
manipulate it, all of that...

17:57.200 --> 17:58.201
I'm right?

19:05.360 --> 19:06.441

19:06.680 --> 19:10.287
I thought you'd like to be informed
that H.R.'s managed to talk Tracy around.

19:10.520 --> 19:11.931
Oh, perfect.
That means we can get to work.

19:12.120 --> 19:14.043
Yeah, there's one thing
I need to know first.

19:14.240 --> 19:17.562
Outside Jitters earlier,
you could've stopped Caitlin with a vibe,

19:17.800 --> 19:20.804
but just like C.C.U., you didn't.

19:21.240 --> 19:23.402
- I'm not doing this again with--
-No,no,no.

19:24.600 --> 19:25.886
You are.

19:27.360 --> 19:29.283
I need to know, Cisco.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.090
Tell me why you couldn't do it.

19:32.480 --> 19:33.811
Get out of my way.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.209
Caitlin could be home now.

19:37.040 --> 19:39.088
Had you stopped her, she would be here.

19:39.560 --> 19:41.961
But you didn't. You couldn't.

19:42.720 --> 19:45.246
- Tell me why!
-Because I'm afraid!

19:46.800 --> 19:49.246
- Afraid of what?
-Afraid of killing her!

19:51.560 --> 19:54.769
I'm walking around with
two loaded guns here, ready to go off.

19:55.320 --> 19:58.244
And what if she's hurting
Barry or Joe or you,

19:58.720 --> 20:00.609
and I have to save you,
and I can't control my powers,

20:00.840 --> 20:01.966
and I end up killing her?

20:02.480 --> 20:06.451
She's my best friend,
and I'd rather it be me than her.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.281
Hey-

20:16.480 --> 20:17.481
Hey-

20:17.800 --> 20:19.131

<i>(SIGHS) We'll see.</i>

20:21.600 --> 20:23.329
Um... (CLEARS THROAT)

20:24.280 --> 20:26.851
Have you told Cecile about us yet?

20:29.160 --> 20:33.802
Cecile is the only thing normal
I have in my life right now,

20:34.160 --> 20:35.650
and I like having something normal.

20:35.880 --> 20:40.522
If I tell her about all of this,
that goes away.

20:40.880 --> 20:42.962
But if you don't tell her...

20:43.480 --> 20:45.687
- There may not be an "us."
-Mmm-hmm.

20:46.280 --> 20:49.329
Joe, there's no such thing as normal.

20:50.840 --> 20:53.161
Love is the only thing
that makes the fight worth it,

20:53.320 --> 20:55.527

that's gonna get us through it.

20:57.720 --> 20:59.563
Guys. Guys, there you are.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.963
We've got a big problem. Tracy's gone.

21:12.680 --> 21:16.401
I checked C.C.U., her apartment,
and Jitters. Tracy's not at any of them.

21:16.640 --> 21:19.371
I'll bet you Savitar and Killer Frost
are hunting her down as we speak.

21:19.520 --> 21:21.409
H.R., you were with Tracy last.
How did she seem?

21:21.640 --> 21:23.483
Rattled, Ms. West. Rattled.

21:23.680 --> 21:25.250
But I gave her a rousing
and reassuring pep talk,

21:25.480 --> 21:26.402
so I think she's okay.

21:26.680 --> 21:28.762
- Oh, that's why she left.
-That's not why... I'll...

21:29.000 --> 21:31.082
Look, I'll have you know,
my book on motivational speeches,

21:31.320 --> 21:32.890
<i>All's Wells that Ends Wells--</i>

21:33.040 --> 21:34.041
Tracy is in danger.

21:34.240 --> 21:36.004
- You're right. Iris, focus.
-What?

21:36.200 --> 21:38.441
- We need to find her. Now.
-Yeah, we've got to find her.

21:39.040 --> 21:40.883
Where else could she be?

21:41.200 --> 21:42.406
Oh...

21:42.600 --> 21:43.886
Why don't we start
with her future hologram, right?

21:44.080 --> 21:45.445
That'll give us insight
into her psyche, no?

21:45.680 --> 21:46.681
Of course, yeah.

21:46.880 --> 21:48.291
- That's pretty good.
-Thank you.

21:51.520 --> 21:53.090
- Thanks.
-You're welcome.

21:56.080 --> 21:57.764

22:00.160 --> 22:02.401
- She's cute.
-This is creepy, right?

22:02.560 --> 22:03.561
- Yeah.
-I find her charming.

22:03.800 --> 22:05.643
Do you think you could
screenshot a hologram?

22:05.920 --> 22:07.251
Go back to that last one.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.130
Yeah, there's another one like it.

22:10.960 --> 22:12.962
- Whoa! Whoa! Look at that. Zoom in.
-Yeah.

after being forced to recant his theory

22:42.200 --> 22:45.488
that the Earth revolves around the sun.

22:45.680 --> 22:50.607
"And yet it moves." Mocha-Flash for me.
A Zoom for my lady.

22:50.840 --> 22:53.047
- Thank you.
-You're very welcome.

22:53.280 --> 22:54.645
How did you know I was here?

22:54.800 --> 22:57.644
Um, I might have done
a bit of holographic stalking.

22:57.800 --> 22:59.211
I stalked you holographically.

22:59.480 --> 23:02.962
You mean in the future I'm still obsessed
with a 500-year-old Italian polymath?

23:03.160 --> 23:04.810
<i>H.R.: Yes, it would appear so.</i>

23:05.120 --> 23:08.010
- I'm sorry I ran off. I just--
-No.

23:08.240 --> 23:09.810
- Just needed to clear my head and think.
-Of course.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.331
And this is where I do it best.

23:11.520 --> 23:14.410
I can see that.
That statue is nothing if not inspiring.

23:14.640 --> 23:18.201
Concrete beard, foreboding, smart.

23:18.560 --> 23:20.210
- Totally inspiring.
-Yep.

23:20.400 --> 23:24.371
You know, Galileo's peers
thought he was a crackpot, too.

23:24.560 --> 23:25.561
- Is that right?
-Yeah.

23:25.840 --> 23:27.490
- And I used to find that comforting.
-Oh. (CHUCKLES)

23:27.640 --> 23:30.371
But then when your team
showed me the future,

23:31.160 --> 23:35.370
showed me that my crazy ideas
aren't so crazy after all,

23:36.160 --> 23:39.084
I just felt more intimidated than ever.

23:39.760 --> 23:41.444
Well, I can see that.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.526
It's like you're sitting
in the shadow of greatness.

23:44.680 --> 23:47.160
- Your own greatness, right?
-Exactly!

23:47.400 --> 23:51.849
It's like I've failed so many times,
that's all I know how to do.

23:52.000 --> 23:58.087
I don't know how to be
that brilliant woman in the hologram.

24:00.600 --> 24:03.365
But you wouldn't understand.
You are a born genius.

24:04.520 --> 24:09.686
Yeah, about that,
I'm not technically a genius.

24:10.920 --> 24:15.721
That was a cheap thing to do. I'm sorry
I misled you about me being a genius.

24:15.880 --> 24:20.761
The point is, you are a genius.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.566
You are. I know it. I can...
I can feel it.

24:23.720 --> 24:27.566
It's right there. It's right there
just brimming just below the surface.

24:27.720 --> 24:29.722
- It is?
-Yes, absolutely.

24:30.080 --> 24:31.923
Yes, it is, Tracy.

24:32.120 --> 24:35.567
And you can defeat Savitar.

24:36.560 --> 24:39.450
All you need is
to just believe in yourself.

24:40.400 --> 24:41.925
For what it's worth,

24:44.400 --> 24:45.731
I already do.

24:52.080 --> 24:53.570
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

24:56.560 --> 24:57.607
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

24:59.080 --> 25:00.081
Hmm.

25:06.520 --> 25:08.010
- Hi.
-Hey.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.241
I didn't know you were dropping by.

25:09.480 --> 25:12.131
Yeah, well, if you'd read
any of my texts you'd know.

25:13.120 --> 25:14.451
(SIGHS) Yeah. Um...

25:18.120 --> 25:19.451
- I'm sorry.
-I know.

25:19.600 --> 25:21.602
<i>It's why I'm here. Look,</i> I...

25:21.760 --> 25:25.287
You know, it doesn't take a detective
to see that something's not right.

25:25.760 --> 25:26.841
Look, Cecile--

25:27.120 --> 25:28.645
Is it because I said,
"I love you," this morning?

25:29.280 --> 25:32.887
Because, Joe, it's... It's okay
if you're not ready to say it back.

25:33.120 --> 25:34.884
No, no, it's not about that.

25:35.120 --> 25:37.282
No? Well, then what's going on?

25:37.480 --> 25:40.290
'Cause you've been acting weird all day.
I mean, not just with us this morning,

25:40.440 --> 25:42.647
but at work with that meta case. I...

25:42.800 --> 25:44.962
You've got to give me something, Joe.

25:46.200 --> 25:52.970
All I can say is that
part of my life is very complicated,

25:53.640 --> 25:56.325
and if you were to become part of that,

25:56.600 --> 26:01.162
your life would be very complicated,
and it would change us.

26:01.800 --> 26:03.211
And I mean change us forever.

26:05.480 --> 26:09.201
It's not a bad thing, you know.
It's called growth.

26:11.040 --> 26:16.729
And then I was thinking
about what you said this morning,

26:17.200 --> 26:19.168
and it told me where you were.

26:20.120 --> 26:23.408
It also showed me where I was, and...

26:24.560 --> 26:26.961
And you add those complications

26:27.520 --> 26:29.648
and I think we should stop
seeing each other.

26:31.280 --> 26:32.566
(VOICE BREAKS) Really?

26:35.840 --> 26:37.968
That's what you think we should do?

26:38.200 --> 26:41.329
I... I think it's the best thing
for both of us.

26:42.400 --> 26:46.291
Here I was thinking that being together
was the best thing for both of us.

26:51.880 --> 26:56.204
I guess I'll... I'll see you
around the station, Joe.

27:08.560 --> 27:09.561
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

27:14.000 --> 27:15.001
- Cecile!
-Joe.

27:15.200 --> 27:17.806
- No, I guarantee you I'm faster.
-Joe, help.

27:18.840 --> 27:22.003
Caitlin, we can talk about this.

27:22.240 --> 27:23.844
<i>FROST". I'll talk. You listen.</i>

27:24.040 --> 27:27.203
In an hour, you're gonna get a message
with an address.

27:27.400 --> 27:31.724
Bring me Tracy Brand,
or I will kill your little sweetheart.

27:31.960 --> 27:33.644
(WHIMPERS) Joe.

27:34.960 --> 27:35.961
Wait.

(CECILE SCREAMS)

27:37.840 --> 27:39.046
(YELLS)

27:50.160 --> 27:53.403
So you're saying that if we
don't turn Tracy over to Killer Frost--

27:53.600 --> 27:55.011
She's gonna kill Cecile.

27:55.200 --> 27:56.247
Correct me if I'm wrong,

27:56.480 --> 27:58.642
but Tracy is our key
to finding Savitar, right?

27:58.840 --> 27:59.887
Yes, but what are we gonna do?

28:00.080 --> 28:02.481
We're gonna just let Killer Frost
live up to her name and kill somebody?

28:02.680 --> 28:04.284
Not if I have anything to say about it.

28:04.480 --> 28:07.450
All I'm saying is, we need to do
whatever it takes to save her.

28:07.640 --> 28:10.610
No one's gonna die, all right?
We're gonna get her back, I promise.

28:10.800 --> 28:12.165
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)

28:12.840 --> 28:15.161
That's them.
They're at the old Dressier Factory.

28:15.520 --> 28:17.887
Okay, we know where they are.
That's something.

28:18.800 --> 28:20.131
So what do we do?

28:20.480 --> 28:22.005
I have a plan.

28:26.200 --> 28:28.089
- Cisco, can I have a quick word?
-Not now, Julian.

28:28.280 --> 28:30.442
Listen, please, mate, just...
Just hear me out.

28:33.360 --> 28:35.567
I know you're terrified of losing her.

28:35.960 --> 28:36.927
So am l.

28:37.120 --> 28:41.842
I know you're... You're worried about
not being able to control your powers,

28:42.280 --> 28:43.725
but I know you can.

28:44.360 --> 28:50.322
I don't think your abilities have ever
come from a place of negativity or hate.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.124
They come from somewhere good.

28:53.520 --> 28:55.045
They come from love.

28:56.800 --> 29:01.203
If you can find it in you to stop her,
then I really think we can save her.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.206
Cheers, mate.

29:11.360 --> 29:12.725
H.R.I Hi.

29:14.200 --> 29:17.886
Yeah, you know how I said, you know,
we were gonna keep you safe?

29:18.240 --> 29:19.241
Um, yeah.

29:19.480 --> 29:24.168
So now I need to ask you
to do something dangerous.

29:36.440 --> 29:38.090
Cecile. Are you all right?

29:38.720 --> 29:40.961
Joe, I'm okay. She didn't hurt me.

29:41.160 --> 29:44.926
FROST: That's because
killing you does nothing for me.

29:47.200 --> 29:50.124
Killing you, Tracy, that's everything.

29:52.680 --> 29:54.011
Hand her over.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.325
You don't have to do this.

29:56.560 --> 29:58.050
Yes, I do.

29:58.240 --> 30:00.925
Why? Because Savitar commands it?

30:01.920 --> 30:05.811
He's not a god.
He's just a man that's using you.

30:07.120 --> 30:08.770
- Come on. You're one of--
-"One of us"?

30:10.240 --> 30:11.605
- We're--
-"We're a family"?

30:12.760 --> 30:15.923
- We protect each other till the end.
-"We protect each other till the end."

(CHUCKLES)

30:18.800 --> 30:20.086
How are you doing that?

30:21.000 --> 30:23.731
Savitar told me everything you'd say.

30:24.080 --> 30:26.287
You two are more alike than you realize.

30:26.960 --> 30:31.090
You see, that's how Savitar knows
every move you're going to make.

30:31.680 --> 30:33.762
He's always one step ahead of you

30:33.960 --> 30:36.122
because this is all history to him.

were talking at the same time,

how do you think she was doing that?

33:23.520 --> 33:25.807
I don't know. She said Savitar told her
what was gonna happen.

No way, man, this wasn't
just brushing up on days to come.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.650
This was precise. Scary precise.

<i>IRIS WEST: What I don't understand is</i>

33:35.880 --> 33:39.123
why Savitar wouldn't kill Tracy
when he showed up.

33:39.280 --> 33:41.601
I mean, why would he choose
to rescue Caitlin?

33:41.840 --> 33:45.287
He needs her for something.
We've got to figure out what that is.

33:45.440 --> 33:48.125
Agreed. Well, thanks to Cisco,
we now have a sample of her blood

33:48.280 --> 33:49.964

as Killer Frost.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.766

with really scary names.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.489
Yeah, but is it too much?

34:34.239 --> 34:36.242
All of us here would understand,
and personally, I just...

34:37.000 --> 34:39.810
I just wanna make sure that, you know,
you don't get hurt.

34:40.320 --> 34:43.164
As a matter of fact,
I was thinking that we should--

34:43.320 --> 34:45.607
- I was thinking, too. About Savitar.
-Mmm-hmm.

34:45.800 --> 34:47.643
The way the light reflects off his suit,

34:47.840 --> 34:50.605
it's unlike any other metallic compound
I have ever seen.

34:50.920 --> 34:52.922
Hmm. You and I were thinking
about different things.

34:53.120 --> 34:55.088
- What do you think it is?
-In Fermi-liquid theory,

34:55.320 --> 34:58.688
any sort of non-Fermi liquid
is called "strange metal."

34:58.840 --> 35:01.810
It's a theoretical compound capable
of dispersing heat at high temperatures.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.771
I think Savitar travels so fast

35:04.960 --> 35:08.442
that he needs that suit to neutralize
the charge he builds up around him.

35:08.640 --> 35:10.847
Ha! Interesting. So without the suit,

35:11.480 --> 35:14.324
he's just a dude
with a bad case of static cling.

35:14.520 --> 35:18.889
Yeah. So if we could build a device
capable of harnessing that power,

35:20.040 --> 35:24.011
theoretically, we could use
his own velocity against him.

35:24.200 --> 35:26.521
And trap him in the Speed Force.

35:26.840 --> 35:29.730
Tracy, you are indeed a genius.

35:29.880 --> 35:32.281
- I'm getting there.
-Well, yes, you are. (GASPS)

35:32.520 --> 35:34.887
That means you're gonna stay and help us.
Is that what that means?

35:35.120 --> 35:37.043
If I do, does that mean
the future's changing?

Although I obviously have some idea now.

36:13.600 --> 36:16.444

When you told me
that you loved me this morning,

36:28.400 --> 36:30.243
- I froze.
-(SCOFFS) Yeah.

36:30.560 --> 36:35.248
I knew that it meant that
we moved up a level in our relationship,

36:35.720 --> 36:41.807
and, for me, that level
comes with a lot of baggage.

36:42.240 --> 36:44.402
Like Killer Frost and the Flash.

36:44.600 --> 36:45.726
Yeah.

36:45.920 --> 36:48.810
So you thought that pushing me away
was the thing to do?

36:49.240 --> 36:51.811
I thought that I was protecting you.

36:52.880 --> 36:56.965
Clearly, I was wrong
because not only did I lie to you,

36:57.880 --> 36:58.961
I lied to myself.

Don't worry, she promised me
that she wouldn't tell Joanie. (LAUGHS)

38:40.680 --> 38:44.048
- What changed your mind?
-You. All of you.

38:44.560 --> 38:45.686
Love's the only thing
we've got in this world.

38:45.920 --> 38:49.891
- Without it, nothing really matters.
-Hmm.

38:50.520 --> 38:53.603
And who knows what we'd become
if we didn't have it?

38:54.640 --> 38:55.971
<i>How was Earth-3?</i>

38:56.920 --> 39:00.208
Yeah, um... Hanging outwith Jesse
was awesome. She's...

39:00.440 --> 39:01.771
<i>JOE: Love's the only thing
we've got in this world.</i>

39:01.960 --> 39:04.440
<i>Without it, nothing really matters.</i>

39:04.960 --> 39:07.281
<i>And who knows what we'd become
if we didn't have it?</i>

39:07.880 --> 39:09.086
<i>SAVITAR: You did this to me, Barry.</i>

39:09.320 --> 39:10.321
<i>BARRY". I created you?</i>

39:10.560 --> 39:11.482
I created myself.

39:11.720 --> 39:13.404
BARRY: You're even gonna create time
remnants of yourself,

39:13.600 --> 39:14.726
<i>but he's gonna kill them all.</i>

39:14.920 --> 39:17.127
<i>FROST:
Savitar told me everything you'd say.</i>

39:17.280 --> 39:19.601
You two are more alike than you realize.

39:19.800 --> 39:22.770
<i>Savitar knows
every move you're going to make.</i>

39:22.960 --> 39:24.246
<i>He's always one step ahead of you.</i>

39:24.440 --> 39:25.441
<i>This is all history.</i>

39:25.960 --> 39:27.769
<i>CISCO: This wasn't
just brushing up on days to come.</i>

39:27.960 --> 39:29.007
<i>This was precise.</i>

39:29.240 --> 39:30.241
Like Savitar was there.

39:30.440 --> 39:32.329
<i>JOE: Who knows what we'd become
if we didn't have it?</i>

39:32.560 --> 39:34.130
<i>FROST: One step ahead of you. All history.</i>

39:34.280 --> 39:35.964
lam the future, Flash.

39:36.240 --> 39:37.287
<i>FROST: One step ahead of you.</i>

39:37.440 --> 39:39.807
<i>IRIS</i> WEST: <i>Barry? Barry?</i>

39:41.480 --> 39:42.641
Are you okay?

39:44.480 --> 39:45.641
Yeah.

39:46.800 --> 39:48.131
I'm sorry.

39:49.760 --> 39:51.489
I'll be... I'll be right back, all right?

40:05.360 --> 40:06.850
I'm here.

40:08.160 --> 40:09.685
(SHOUTING) I'm here!

40:09.960 --> 40:10.961
(PANTS)

40:21.160 --> 40:23.162
I know who you are.

40:23.360 --> 40:25.362
It's about time.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.525
Yes, it is.

40:28.520 --> 40:30.966
Everything with you
is about time, isn't it?

40:31.680 --> 40:33.523
The past, the present, the future.

40:34.800 --> 40:36.529
<i>You know all of it, right?</i>

40:37.000 --> 40:38.968
And you know everything about me!

40:39.680 --> 40:45.050
About Joe, about Wally, and Iris!

40:46.240 --> 40:48.641
You know our strengths.
You know our fears.

40:49.520 --> 40:51.648
You know how much we love each other.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.002
And you know
how to use that love against us.

40:55.880 --> 40:56.881
<i>All this time,</i>

40:57.600 --> 41:00.683
we thought that we couldn't stop you
because you were one step ahead,

41:00.880 --> 41:02.166
but that's not it.

41:02.720 --> 41:05.883
<i>You don't just know
what's gonna happen to us.</i>

41:06.880 --> 41:08.211
You were there.

41:09.360 --> 41:12.091
You lived it. You remember.

41:13.720 --> 41:15.404
When you were me.

41:33.920 --> 41:36.241
Like I told you from the beginning,

41:40.240 --> 41:43.244
lam the Future Flash.
