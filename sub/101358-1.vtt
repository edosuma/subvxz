00:32.415 --> 00:33.550
Everyone
in this life is born

00:33.583 --> 00:34.786
with at least one talent a gift,

00:34.819 --> 00:39.422
an ability to do a
particular something

00:40.091 --> 00:41.959
better than anybody else.

00:41.993 --> 00:46.063
Sadly, most of us will never
realize our true potential.

00:46.097 --> 00:47.799
Either we're too poor,

00:47.832 --> 00:50.400
we were born on the
wrong side of the tracks,

00:50.433 --> 00:52.536
or maybe we're just unlucky.

00:52.569 --> 00:55.072
But the truth is the only
thing holding us back

00:56.107 --> 00:57.407
is ourselves.

01:09.586 --> 01:10.654
Aye!

01:10.687 --> 01:12.023
Aye oi, you man!

01:16.127 --> 01:17.594
What?

01:17.627 --> 01:19.764
Don't run, don't
run, don't run.

01:20.998 --> 01:21.966
All right, on your toes.

01:43.888 --> 01:46.389
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:46.423 --> 01:47.691
Where you
going now, pussy hole?

01:47.724 --> 01:51.128
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

02:02.206 --> 02:04.541
Come out now boy!

02:07.577 --> 02:09.412
Denis had
come to UK from Russia

02:09.446 --> 02:11.082
just five years earlier.

02:11.115 --> 02:13.416
And although his
murder was tragic,

02:13.450 --> 02:16.419
he was just another in a long
line of stabbings that year.

02:16.453 --> 02:18.089
Another wasted talent.

02:18.122 --> 02:20.590
I'll never forget that
day as long as I live,

02:20.624 --> 02:23.060
but for me life
went on as usual.

02:23.995 --> 02:25.763
At least it did for a while

02:25.796 --> 02:27.832
but someone was about
to change all that.

03:21.551 --> 03:23.054
Sweet Ginge.

03:23.087 --> 03:24.221
Alena, can I grab
a drink please?

03:24.255 --> 03:25.222
Spencer.

03:28.725 --> 03:29.559
All right, Ray.

03:30.694 --> 03:32.797
How come your smell
like a hash bar?

03:35.166 --> 03:37.168
I must have smoked
one on the way down,

03:37.201 --> 03:39.170
probably still on the clothes.

03:39.203 --> 03:42.006
If I ever catch you
smoking dope in here

03:42.039 --> 03:45.209
I'm going to have to break
your fingers one by one.

03:46.710 --> 03:47.945
No more snooker, capiche?

03:50.613 --> 03:52.083
Yeah, all right, yeah.

03:52.116 --> 03:53.918
End of your piano
playing as well.

03:58.155 --> 03:59.556
What's the bet?

04:11.668 --> 04:15.572
Yo big man, you want
some crack, some pills?

04:15.605 --> 04:16.906
Excuse me.

04:16.940 --> 04:19.043
I got them quality pills bruv.

04:19.076 --> 04:21.879
Uh, no thanks, I'm good.

04:21.911 --> 04:22.813
Hello, can I help you?

04:22.847 --> 04:25.249
Hi, I'm a friend of Terry.

04:25.282 --> 04:26.183
Who?

04:26.217 --> 04:27.318
You want a wrap of charlie?

04:27.351 --> 04:29.320
- Charlie?
- No, no, no, no.

04:29.353 --> 04:30.287
Hang on a sec.

04:31.889 --> 04:32.689
Fuck off!

04:41.332 --> 04:42.800
A week, right?

04:42.833 --> 04:44.601
Yeah, sweet as man.

04:44.634 --> 04:45.302
Good lad.

05:08.625 --> 05:11.062
You don't get
many strangers in Ray's

05:11.095 --> 05:14.697
and I must confess the first
time I laid eyes on Qiang

05:14.731 --> 05:16.333
I figured he was Old Bill.

05:29.380 --> 05:31.681
Who installed
the water feature?

05:31.714 --> 05:33.716
Same bloke that
nickname lead probably.

05:40.057 --> 05:41.992
So someone stole
the lead, huh?

05:43.828 --> 05:44.929
Yeah, property mate.

05:53.670 --> 05:55.773
Name's Vince Qiang.

05:55.806 --> 05:56.606
Is it?

05:58.708 --> 05:59.343
Fancy a game?

06:00.677 --> 06:02.279
I'm trying to play
a game now mate.

06:02.313 --> 06:04.181
What's the point
in having talent

06:04.215 --> 06:06.350
if you keep it to yourself?

06:06.383 --> 06:07.717
Who said I've got talent?

06:07.751 --> 06:09.320
Oh, everyone has at least one

06:09.353 --> 06:11.422
but I wasn't talking about you.

06:11.455 --> 06:13.023
I was talking about me.

06:13.958 --> 06:14.859
No, you weren't.

06:15.826 --> 06:16.861
So what'd you say?

06:18.896 --> 06:20.197
By the way you wrote your cue

06:20.231 --> 06:22.766
I'd say pool's probably
more your thing, innit?

06:22.800 --> 06:25.069
You're actually right
but I think I can adapt.

06:25.102 --> 06:27.972
It's just a matter
of colors, right?

06:29.240 --> 06:30.274
How do you like pink?

06:32.843 --> 06:33.676
Can you match it?

07:17.888 --> 07:20.457
Have to pot a ball every
time you take a shot.

07:20.491 --> 07:22.393
It's not pot a
ball, it's snooker.

07:24.061 --> 07:25.429
You just lost 50 kid.

07:26.497 --> 07:27.398
Ain't over yet, mate.

07:27.431 --> 07:29.266
Oh, it's over all right.

07:58.796 --> 08:00.297
Unlucky, Spencer.

08:08.872 --> 08:11.909
Oh hey, how'd
you know my name?

08:11.942 --> 08:13.477
Okay, you got me there.

08:14.511 --> 08:16.080
I was sent for you.

08:25.155 --> 08:28.259
Here Chloe, I'll
get that, hang on.

08:29.560 --> 08:31.128
All right girls, let me get it.

08:33.597 --> 08:34.832
What have you got
in here, boulders?

08:34.865 --> 08:36.033
No, it's just
my mom's shopping.

08:36.066 --> 08:37.568
Ah, where is your
mum, in bed again?

08:37.601 --> 08:39.236
Yeah, she said she was tired.

08:39.270 --> 08:40.904
Did she, I bed she did.

08:40.938 --> 08:43.006
- Tired as a newt?
- What's a newt?

08:43.039 --> 08:44.441
Don't talk, Sophie.

08:46.143 --> 08:48.846
Here, let me put
this in there for you.

08:48.879 --> 08:50.281
- Thanks Spencer.
- Ah, you're welcome.

08:50.314 --> 08:52.483
Have a nice evening girls.

09:26.050 --> 09:27.484
Another letter
came for you today.

09:27.518 --> 09:28.919
Oh yeah?

09:28.952 --> 09:29.820
This came and all.

09:30.988 --> 09:32.156
Visiting orders.

09:33.891 --> 09:34.491
What does he want a visit for

09:34.525 --> 09:36.026
he's out in two weeks?

09:36.060 --> 09:37.861
Want me to read the letter?

09:37.895 --> 09:39.129
He's got a job.

09:39.163 --> 09:40.597
What is it, bank job?

09:40.631 --> 09:42.599
No soppy, a proper job.

09:43.934 --> 09:45.202
Might have some work for you.

09:45.235 --> 09:46.937
I don't want his work, mum.

09:46.970 --> 09:48.605
Well, I'm sorry, but I don't
earn enough for both of us.

09:48.639 --> 09:50.641
Not the way you go
through that fridge.

09:50.674 --> 09:52.076
So if you want to carry on

09:52.109 --> 09:54.211
sleeping under this roof
you need to get a job.

10:20.671 --> 10:22.339
What's happening?

10:22.373 --> 10:24.675
Have you got a
light by any chance?

10:24.708 --> 10:25.509
Light?

10:30.981 --> 10:32.015
Spence!

10:32.049 --> 10:33.117
You're too young
to smoke, Lloyd.

10:45.295 --> 10:47.131
What's happening boys?

10:48.532 --> 10:49.700
Did you get it?

10:49.733 --> 10:51.368
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

10:51.402 --> 10:53.670
I'm good, let's go inside
and carve it up, yeah.

10:57.307 --> 10:58.142
Amazing!

11:00.511 --> 11:02.112
Have you found him yet or what?

11:02.146 --> 11:03.447
No hang on, I'm just
trying a different spelling.

11:03.480 --> 11:05.482
That's working, innit?

11:07.985 --> 11:11.121
Eh, no wonder you lost,
look, check this geezer out.

11:12.356 --> 11:14.224
Is that the fellow who
mugged you off, Spence?

11:14.258 --> 11:15.058
What do you mean,
mugged me off?

11:15.092 --> 11:16.360
I lost, that's all.

11:16.393 --> 11:18.695
Man's some big pool
champion as well, man.

11:18.729 --> 11:20.397
Yeah, all right.

11:21.565 --> 11:24.468
Hey, Spence, is that
who I think it is?

11:24.501 --> 11:25.502
Go on.

11:33.744 --> 11:36.113
Yeah, that's him all right.

11:36.146 --> 11:38.248
Ugh, he's a big chappy.

11:40.417 --> 11:42.453
Just play your game, man.

11:55.399 --> 11:58.135
Spence, all right.

11:59.804 --> 12:01.205
Who's Vincent Qiang?

12:03.373 --> 12:04.675
What, that's it?

12:07.277 --> 12:08.545
Five years and you know,

12:08.579 --> 12:10.447
not hello dad how are you?

12:16.053 --> 12:17.187
He's a pool champion.

12:18.055 --> 12:19.523
Well, at least he was.

12:19.556 --> 12:23.393
Nowadays he's like coaching
snooker, pool, anything.

12:23.427 --> 12:25.562
Yeah, I know that,
I looked him up.

12:25.596 --> 12:26.363
Did you?

12:29.233 --> 12:30.567
I met him when I was
working the doors.

12:30.601 --> 12:33.036
He was doing like
an exhibition thing.

12:33.070 --> 12:35.807
What, so you sent him
down to Ray's to mug me off?

12:35.840 --> 12:38.041
What are you talking about?

12:38.075 --> 12:40.077
No, I asked him to
have a look at ya,

12:40.110 --> 12:43.480
see if he'd you know,
consider coaching you.

12:45.616 --> 12:47.618
What do you mean
he mugged you off?

12:47.651 --> 12:50.554
He wasn't doing that Chinese
tourist act thing, was he?

12:50.587 --> 12:52.289
No, I lost, that's all.

12:52.322 --> 12:53.156
You lost?

12:56.426 --> 12:59.363
You know, you were hitting
century breaks at the age of 13.

13:00.564 --> 13:03.500
Yeah, I was was
stoned weren't I.

13:03.534 --> 13:05.669
What, don't approve?

13:05.702 --> 13:08.705
I'm not the one
stuck in here, am I?

13:10.808 --> 13:11.809
Here, Gov.

13:26.123 --> 13:29.593
Passport to the big time
world snooker Q school.

13:29.626 --> 13:30.795
School?

13:30.828 --> 13:31.863
It's a qualifying school.

13:31.896 --> 13:33.330
You can be a pro player.

13:35.599 --> 13:37.601
Who said I want to do that?

13:37.634 --> 13:38.702
Well, it's your dream,
you've always wanted

13:38.735 --> 13:40.704
to be a snooker player.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.606
What do you know
about my dreams?

13:44.341 --> 13:46.343
I hardly saw you
before you was in here.

13:47.477 --> 13:49.413
You don't know me.

13:49.446 --> 13:52.115
No, I don't, I don't know you.

13:57.554 --> 13:58.790
I've made some mistakes, Spence.

13:58.823 --> 14:01.391
I mean, I was a kid
myself when you were born.

14:01.425 --> 14:02.659
You do understand that.

14:08.900 --> 14:10.634
I don't know if your mom
told you but when I get out,

14:10.667 --> 14:12.169
I've got a job.

14:12.202 --> 14:12.736
I'm thinking you and I can
get to know each other.

14:12.770 --> 14:14.605
Yeah, she told me.

14:14.638 --> 14:18.275
Tell you what, you
answer me three questions

14:19.610 --> 14:21.211
and I'll consider doing the job.

14:22.613 --> 14:24.748
On my 7th birthday, I
was waiting at the estate

14:24.782 --> 14:26.550
for someone to come pick me up.

14:28.185 --> 14:28.820
Where was he?

14:30.721 --> 14:32.189
What about my 8th birthday?

14:34.191 --> 14:35.258
Or my 9th?

14:35.292 --> 14:36.660
Yeah, all right, all right.

14:36.693 --> 14:38.362
I wasn't there for
your special occasions

14:38.395 --> 14:41.665
but I visited as much
as I could, all right.

14:41.698 --> 14:43.667
I did take you to the pub
on your 10th birthday.

14:43.700 --> 14:45.903
You remember that,
we played pool.

14:45.937 --> 14:46.771
You remember?

14:47.939 --> 14:50.407
And then we went back to
your mum's, we had some cake.

14:50.440 --> 14:51.608
Whoop de fucking dos.

14:55.813 --> 14:57.214
Do you know what?

14:58.382 --> 14:59.483
I will do the work
'cause I don't want

14:59.516 --> 15:02.252
to hear mum bitching
and moaning.

15:03.788 --> 15:05.288
But let me tell you something,

15:06.256 --> 15:08.826
I do not want to
know you, Terry.

15:21.605 --> 15:22.907
All right, cool
yeah, nice one.

15:22.940 --> 15:25.810
George just been on the
blower, he wants a Henry.

15:32.749 --> 15:35.619
You won't be so flash when
you get chored, will ya?

15:35.652 --> 15:37.254
How am I being flash?

15:37.287 --> 15:39.356
Besides, you're the one out
thieving all day, aren't ya?

15:39.389 --> 15:41.658
I get caught, I get
a slap on the wrist.

15:41.692 --> 15:43.861
You're dealing class
A boy, and for what?

15:45.662 --> 15:48.465
You could earn what Ginger
gives you flicking burgers.

15:48.498 --> 15:50.734
Oh my dazes, are you
hearing this Wallis?

15:50.768 --> 15:52.837
Clarky thinks we should
be flipping burgers, bruv.

15:52.870 --> 15:54.671
Yeah, all right.

15:54.705 --> 15:56.640
Such a vandal, Wallis.

15:56.673 --> 15:58.542
Vandal, are you joking?

15:58.575 --> 15:59.643
I just doubled the
price on the property,

15:59.676 --> 16:00.677
on his shit hole.

16:00.711 --> 16:01.946
That is quality mate, that is.

16:01.979 --> 16:03.380
That's bollocks,
that's what it is.

16:03.413 --> 16:07.885
Yeah all right,
behave.

16:20.865 --> 16:24.836
Spencer, up,
you're already late!

16:24.869 --> 16:27.237
Mum, what are you doing?

16:41.651 --> 16:42.954
Spencer, get up!

16:46.323 --> 16:48.025
Mum, what are you doing,
have you gone mad or something?

16:48.059 --> 16:49.726
No, but I will do if
you don't get your arse

16:49.761 --> 16:51.661
out of that bed.

16:51.695 --> 16:54.731
Your dad's called, he's already
been waiting half an hour!

17:15.819 --> 17:17.721
You getting out or what?

17:24.461 --> 17:25.395
What we doing here?

17:25.428 --> 17:26.630
We're working.

17:26.663 --> 17:27.765
Well, at least you are,
I'm just a spectator.

17:27.799 --> 17:29.867
Take it you're not
stoned this morning.

17:29.901 --> 17:30.734
Q.

17:32.770 --> 17:34.005
Hang on, what are you doing?

17:34.038 --> 17:37.440
I'm meant to be mixing
cement and stacking bricks.

17:37.474 --> 17:38.776
Yeah, it's plenty
of time for that.

17:38.810 --> 17:40.510
But today I'm paying
you to play snooker.

17:40.544 --> 17:41.846
How's a hundred
quid sounds to ya?

17:41.879 --> 17:43.948
No, I ain't your
show pony, boss.

17:43.981 --> 17:46.918
All right, if you win,
I'll give you a two'er.

17:47.985 --> 17:49.120
Here you are, mate.

17:49.153 --> 17:53.690
Terry, good to see
you out of prison-issue

17:53.723 --> 17:55.559
joggers and sweat
top on my friend.

17:55.592 --> 17:56.794
Not a good look.

17:56.828 --> 17:58.361
Oh really, I thought
it quite suited me.

17:58.395 --> 17:59.096
Hey listen, talking
about good looks

17:59.130 --> 18:00.932
you still got those glasses?

18:00.965 --> 18:03.801
I dug them out
specially for you.

18:05.136 --> 18:06.403
Ah, Spencer!

18:06.436 --> 18:07.737
You very good!

18:07.772 --> 18:09.841
You ready to place snooker?

18:09.874 --> 18:11.508
Brilliant,
brilliant, you know,

18:11.541 --> 18:13.510
some nights he made a small
fortunate on that little act.

18:13.543 --> 18:14.145
Really?

18:14.178 --> 18:15.445
It's all set up.

18:15.478 --> 18:16.680
Would you like
something to eat first?

18:16.713 --> 18:18.515
I can get Shelly
to cook something.

18:18.548 --> 18:20.017
No, you're all right,
let's get this over with.

18:20.051 --> 18:21.819
Okay, let's do it.

18:22.920 --> 18:24.021
27.

18:58.155 --> 18:58.990
Sharp.

19:26.549 --> 19:28.451
- Well played.
- Cheers.

19:30.021 --> 19:31.688
You owe me 200 quid.

19:31.721 --> 19:32.890
See you later.

19:37.862 --> 19:39.429
So, what do you reckon?

19:40.197 --> 19:41.866
He can certainly pot balls.

19:41.899 --> 19:43.533
His long game is outstanding.

19:44.734 --> 19:45.937
I'm sensing a but.

19:45.970 --> 19:48.638
Shelly, can you give
us a moment please?

19:56.713 --> 19:58.115
This tournament thing.

19:58.149 --> 20:00.051
It's a big commitment.

20:00.084 --> 20:03.453
Wouldn't you rather spend
quality time with him before...

20:04.188 --> 20:06.057
Before what?

20:06.090 --> 20:06.891
It's all right, you
can say it, mate.

20:06.924 --> 20:07.992
I'm not scared of it.

20:08.025 --> 20:09.626
It's your choice.

20:09.659 --> 20:11.695
I think he deserves
to know the truth.

20:11.728 --> 20:14.597
He'll hate you if you
keep this thing from him.

20:14.631 --> 20:15.565
He hates me already.

20:15.598 --> 20:16.533
I don't want to guilt trip him

20:16.566 --> 20:18.035
into spending more time with me.

20:18.069 --> 20:20.104
What I do want is to stop
him from fucking his life up.

20:20.137 --> 20:21.671
I get that.

20:21.705 --> 20:26.177
It's just, you don't have
to face this on your own.

20:28.079 --> 20:29.981
Well, trust me mate, if I
could give you a little bit

20:30.014 --> 20:31.816
of this then we can
fight it together.

20:31.849 --> 20:33.150
That's not funny.

20:33.184 --> 20:34.218
Eh?

20:34.251 --> 20:35.652
Then what you smiling for then?

20:35.685 --> 20:37.487
Come on, you gonna
help me out or what?

20:49.733 --> 20:52.103
Yeah, hold up, that's me.

20:59.076 --> 21:01.745
- All right, then.
- Sweet Ginge.

21:04.647 --> 21:06.616
Now listen, don't
be hanging about here

21:06.649 --> 21:08.185
with that all night, right?

21:08.219 --> 21:10.687
'Cause it's got my
prints all over it.

21:10.720 --> 21:14.158
So do what you gotta do, get
rid of the packaging, okay?

21:15.359 --> 21:19.897
Yeah, of course, sweet.

21:19.930 --> 21:20.765
It's good, Ginge.

21:21.899 --> 21:23.200
Right, bolt.

21:55.166 --> 21:56.901
What's that?

21:56.934 --> 21:58.135
What do you mean?

21:58.169 --> 22:00.037
You gotta mix it, you
gotta let it go round!

22:00.071 --> 22:01.305
Cover that up!

22:01.338 --> 22:03.274
- Spence, cover it up!
- All right, sir!

22:04.741 --> 22:06.844
Youse the one who showed
me how to do it, anyway.

22:09.080 --> 22:10.047
Shit!

22:26.263 --> 22:27.798
- Mrs. Taylor?
- Yes?

22:27.832 --> 22:29.867
Detective Inspector Bligh.

22:29.900 --> 22:32.369
We have a warrant to
search these premises.

22:43.746 --> 22:45.182
Morning, Wallis.

22:45.216 --> 22:46.117
How are you today?

22:50.254 --> 22:52.756
Oh dear, got yourself a floater.

23:02.133 --> 23:06.303
Heard what happened
to your mate, Denis.

23:08.738 --> 23:10.107
That must have been hard on you.

23:40.237 --> 23:41.372
Hello, Spencer.

23:44.308 --> 23:45.142
Had a nice day?

23:47.111 --> 23:50.948
I have, I had a terrific day.

23:53.017 --> 23:55.152
Had the old Bill turn
the house upside down.

23:56.253 --> 23:57.888
Yeah well, I don't keep
nothing here, do I mum.

23:57.922 --> 23:59.156
They're not going
to find anything.

23:59.190 --> 24:01.425
Oh, oh, so that's
all right, isn't it?

24:03.294 --> 24:07.198
I've had two men rifling
through my knicker drawer

24:07.231 --> 24:09.867
and you think that's all right?

24:09.900 --> 24:10.801
I don't need to
hear this shit.

24:10.834 --> 24:12.203
Yes you do!

24:12.236 --> 24:16.040
I am sick of this,
Spencer, I am sick of it!

24:18.242 --> 24:19.343
And I wouldn't
bother going round

24:19.376 --> 24:20.978
to your little mates either,

24:21.011 --> 24:24.048
because he was carted off at
seven o'clock this morning.

24:26.884 --> 24:28.285
Do you reckon he'll get bail?

24:28.319 --> 24:29.820
What, with his record?

24:29.853 --> 24:32.189
He's already got three
no-shows, doesn't he?

24:32.223 --> 24:33.324
Your little reign
of drug barons

24:33.357 --> 24:35.059
didn't last too long, did it?

24:35.092 --> 24:36.760
Payback Ginger for the gear?

24:36.794 --> 24:37.828
- No.
- Whoa.

24:37.861 --> 24:39.296
Nice knowing you, Spence.

24:39.330 --> 24:40.965
Why don't you go into
business with your old man?

24:40.998 --> 24:43.901
Your mom must have a pair of
old stockings you can borrow.

24:46.470 --> 24:48.239
- Get on this whip.
- Cool.

24:48.272 --> 24:51.108
Spencer, can we talk?

24:53.143 --> 24:54.245
I ain't got nothing
to you say to you, bruv.

24:54.278 --> 24:55.879
Come on, get in.

24:55.913 --> 24:57.982
I've got a business
proposition to put to you.

25:00.317 --> 25:01.418
Spence, what you doing?

25:01.452 --> 25:03.220
- I'll catch you lot at Ray's.
- What?

25:03.254 --> 25:08.392
I'll chat to you later.

25:08.425 --> 25:09.226
That's a lovely motor.

25:11.395 --> 25:14.131
Let me guess, it's about
that Q school thing, is it?

25:14.164 --> 25:17.101
No, unfortunately we
missed the entry deadline

25:17.134 --> 25:18.469
for the Q school.

25:18.502 --> 25:19.970
There's another tournament
that I'd like you

25:20.004 --> 25:23.407
to consider being
held in my hometown.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.309
- Where's that?
- Beijing.

25:25.342 --> 25:27.378
Beijing, nah, I
can't go to Beijing.

25:27.411 --> 25:28.579
Sure you can.

25:28.612 --> 25:31.315
I'll sort out the
entry forms, flights,

25:31.348 --> 25:33.384
accommodation
expenses, everything.

25:33.417 --> 25:35.953
All you've got to do
is say yes and show up.

25:37.321 --> 25:38.489
You expect me to
play in this tournament

25:38.522 --> 25:40.324
just 'cause he
wants me to, yeah?

25:40.357 --> 25:41.825
No, you're supposed to play

25:41.859 --> 25:45.195
because it's a pathway
to a better life.

25:47.398 --> 25:49.400
What do you know
about my life?

25:49.433 --> 25:51.335
Oh, that's a tough one.

25:51.368 --> 25:56.173
Let me see you spend most
of your time hanging out

25:56.206 --> 25:58.275
with your buddies
at the snooker hall

25:58.309 --> 26:00.411
or when you're not doing
that you're most likely

26:00.444 --> 26:04.348
sitting on a wall somewhere
drinking, smoking dope,

26:04.381 --> 26:07.284
probably dabble in
petty crime or drugs,

26:07.318 --> 26:08.619
would be my guess.

26:08.652 --> 26:11.555
Oh, then there's the knife,
gotta have a knife, right?

26:11.588 --> 26:12.556
How am I doing?

26:14.191 --> 26:17.161
I could drive to any major
city, London, Liverpool,

26:17.194 --> 26:20.397
Manchester, you name it
and I see you standing

26:20.431 --> 26:23.534
on every shitty back
street corner I pass.

26:24.501 --> 26:26.970
You're not original,
you're a fucking drone

26:28.372 --> 26:31.008
and one day you'll
look back on your life

26:31.041 --> 26:33.410
and realize that you
did nothing with it.

26:33.444 --> 26:35.245
Don't do that.

26:35.279 --> 26:36.880
What, like him you mean?

26:37.881 --> 26:40.351
What I can't tolerate
in people is stupidity.

26:40.384 --> 26:43.654
If you really don't want
to do this, that's fine.

26:43.687 --> 26:46.123
But if you refuse to do
this, cause you're angry

26:46.156 --> 26:49.493
at your father then
you're an idiot.

27:04.074 --> 27:05.242
Okay, get out.

27:13.484 --> 27:14.685
I ain't an idiot, you know.

27:14.718 --> 27:15.619
Prove it.

27:15.652 --> 27:17.388
Don't be like your old man.

27:17.421 --> 27:19.022
Do something with your life.

27:21.558 --> 27:22.960
What
do I get if I win?

27:22.993 --> 27:25.362
You get to play
on the pro tour.

27:29.299 --> 27:31.635
All right, what
have I got to do?

27:31.668 --> 27:34.371
Be at my place
tomorrow, 9 a.m..

27:42.980 --> 27:43.614
Spencer.

27:45.716 --> 27:48.152
I'm not asking you
to change who you are

27:48.185 --> 27:51.388
but you may want to change
the way you see things.

27:51.422 --> 27:52.589
It's about perspective.

28:10.474 --> 28:12.576
You ain't going to
win no tournament.

28:12.609 --> 28:14.244
I've won them before.

28:14.278 --> 28:17.581
Yeah, in this piss hole
against shit players.

28:17.614 --> 28:18.749
You ain't that good.

28:18.783 --> 28:20.517
How'd you expect
to pay for it anyway?

28:20.551 --> 28:22.453
You know, hotels,
flights to China?

28:22.486 --> 28:24.288
He's paying for it, innit,
if he thinks I'm that good.

28:24.321 --> 28:25.322
Yeah, a good sort.

28:26.557 --> 28:28.525
I mean, it's sort
a bit cozy innit.

28:28.559 --> 28:31.428
Just the two of you fancy hotel,

28:31.462 --> 28:34.598
that four poster bed.

28:34.631 --> 28:35.999
Ain't two of us going though,

28:36.033 --> 28:38.435
I'm taking your mum as
entertainment, aint' I?

28:38.469 --> 28:40.137
Oh, that's deep, bruv.

28:40.170 --> 28:41.505
You want to stop with the
mum thing, I'm telling ya.

28:41.538 --> 28:42.439
You want to stop
mugging me off.

28:42.473 --> 28:44.241
You're mugging yourself off.

28:44.274 --> 28:46.076
Keep talking shit.

28:46.109 --> 28:47.544
I'm so good.

28:47.578 --> 28:49.746
I'm gonna be a snooker champion.

28:49.781 --> 28:51.148
What's your problem, Clark?

28:51.181 --> 28:52.416
You're my problem.

28:52.449 --> 28:53.550
Your mum this, your
mum that, bollocks!

28:53.584 --> 28:55.252
He don't like it, does he?

28:55.285 --> 28:56.553
It was you that's been
giving it all day.

28:56.587 --> 28:59.056
Talk about my mum's stockings.

28:59.089 --> 29:00.457
Stockings!

29:00.491 --> 29:01.391
What's he talking about?

29:01.425 --> 29:02.559
Hey, you two, fuck's sake!

29:02.593 --> 29:04.394
You know what Clark,
if you want to go

29:04.428 --> 29:05.696
let's just fucking go, eh?

29:05.729 --> 29:06.764
- Come on!
- Aye!

29:08.599 --> 29:09.666
Stop it!

29:09.700 --> 29:12.369
You want to fight, go outside!

29:15.606 --> 29:17.508
You know what?

29:17.541 --> 29:20.644
You can fuck off Clark,
'cause you're just a wanker.

29:20.677 --> 29:21.478
Spence.

29:22.780 --> 29:25.783
Yeah, it weren't me who watched
Denis get shanked, was it?

29:25.817 --> 29:27.684
How dare you talk
about my brother!

29:34.658 --> 29:35.492
I'm...

29:38.128 --> 29:38.763
I'm sorry.

29:44.568 --> 29:46.670
We've got to stop
meeting like this.

29:46.703 --> 29:47.839
You all right, Lloyd?

29:47.872 --> 29:51.542
Yeah Spence, I'm
good, I'm good.

29:51.575 --> 29:53.343
Out a bit late, aren't ya?

29:53.377 --> 29:56.046
I was just on my way back
from my gran's, actually yeah.

29:57.614 --> 29:59.683
I swear those things are
supposed to unscrew, you know.

29:59.716 --> 30:01.618
Yeah, I have heard that.

30:01.652 --> 30:04.521
Must have lost the
instructions, eh.

30:04.555 --> 30:06.758
No, you're all right bruv.

30:06.791 --> 30:08.659
Police got your mate, innit?

30:08.692 --> 30:10.627
Yeah man, they certainly did.

30:11.796 --> 30:13.865
They came looking
down mine the other day.

30:13.898 --> 30:15.699
Was they looking
for your brother?

30:15.732 --> 30:19.169
He had a gun, you know.

30:19.202 --> 30:21.371
All right, Spence.

30:21.405 --> 30:22.539
Sweet, Mike.

30:24.708 --> 30:26.276
All right, I better
go, I'll catch you later.

30:26.310 --> 30:27.644
Later, Lloyd.

30:35.686 --> 30:37.354
Who's your mate?

30:37.387 --> 30:38.221
Who, that?

30:39.723 --> 30:41.692
That's dangerous Lloyd, bruv.

30:41.725 --> 30:45.495
He backs me as well, you know,
you ought to be more careful.

30:46.663 --> 30:47.564
Give us a bang on that.

30:51.268 --> 30:52.102
Lil pussy.

30:57.274 --> 30:58.810
All right, where we going?

30:58.843 --> 31:00.344
Yeah, sweet man.

31:00.377 --> 31:01.813
You owe me a
new cue, you know.

31:12.589 --> 31:13.690
You're late.

31:13.724 --> 31:15.258
Sorry, yeah, trains.

31:16.593 --> 31:17.461
Forgot your cue?

31:19.897 --> 31:21.498
Do you know what, it broke.

31:22.633 --> 31:24.601
Go home, Spencer,
sleep it off.

31:25.870 --> 31:28.238
Come back tomorrow and
we'll go through the rules.

31:53.730 --> 31:56.633
Listen, about what Clark
said the other night.

31:56.667 --> 31:58.602
Don't worry about it.

31:59.703 --> 32:02.874
He was right though.

32:02.907 --> 32:06.243
I just sort of stood there
and watched it happen.

32:06.276 --> 32:09.212
You were frightened,
I don't blame you.

32:11.983 --> 32:15.820
If you want to do
something, give me the name.

32:18.823 --> 32:21.291
I don't even got a name.

32:21.324 --> 32:22.659
Never seen him before or since.

32:24.661 --> 32:27.297
If I had a name, trust
me he'd get done, innit.

32:27.330 --> 32:28.331
And then what?

32:28.365 --> 32:29.767
Go to prison all your life?

32:31.568 --> 32:32.970
Leave it to professionals.

32:33.871 --> 32:36.573
Do you know what
kind of a man is Ray?

32:38.810 --> 32:41.244
Yeah, I heard stories
about him growing up.

32:41.278 --> 32:43.447
Used to run most of south
London when I was a kid.

32:43.480 --> 32:44.816
And he's like a father to me.

32:46.984 --> 32:50.687
So you give the name to Ray
and the rest is history.

32:51.722 --> 32:52.556
A name.

32:54.892 --> 32:55.692
That's all.

33:09.740 --> 33:10.942
No smoking pot.

33:10.975 --> 33:13.710
In fact, no drugs, period.

33:13.744 --> 33:15.445
No drinking the
night before a match.

33:15.479 --> 33:17.547
You need a clear head.

33:17.581 --> 33:20.484
Snooker is a gentleman's
game, so no swearing.

33:20.517 --> 33:22.887
You will be respectful,
win or lose.

33:22.920 --> 33:25.589
You will shake the hand
of your opponent before

33:25.622 --> 33:27.257
and after the match.

33:27.959 --> 33:29.359
Anything you want to say?

33:30.560 --> 33:32.662
I didn't know I
was allowed to talk.

33:32.696 --> 33:34.364
Talking is good.

33:34.397 --> 33:37.634
I've arranged a match for
you a week on Saturday.

33:37.667 --> 33:38.903
Against who?

33:38.936 --> 33:40.972
Dao Leung, or Daggers.

33:41.005 --> 33:44.508
According to my sources,
he is the next big thing.

33:44.541 --> 33:47.744
I told them you are
the next big thing.

33:48.813 --> 33:49.746
Don't let me down.

33:50.782 --> 33:51.883
Don't worry, I won't.

33:51.916 --> 33:54.351
Good, let's get to work.

34:07.965 --> 34:09.766
Oh, I needed that.

34:24.849 --> 34:26.851
Do you want another tea?

34:30.755 --> 34:32.924
Get another tea please, love?

34:38.562 --> 34:42.800
Eat now and then we'll get
back to work, all right.

34:54.011 --> 34:56.013
All right, Spencer.

34:56.047 --> 34:58.381
What's happening wee man?

34:58.415 --> 35:00.383
Nothing much, been out trying
to get your dough, innit.

35:00.417 --> 35:01.819
Old Bill took all the
cash and all the gear

35:01.853 --> 35:02.920
when they got Wal, so.

35:02.954 --> 35:04.922
Aye, I heard about that.

35:07.724 --> 35:08.826
And I'm willing to
give you some more time

35:10.694 --> 35:11.963
but don't avoid me.

35:11.996 --> 35:14.497
I'm telling you don't avoid me.

35:15.933 --> 35:17.068
Nah.

35:17.101 --> 35:19.904
'Cause it's five
fucking grand Spencer.

35:19.937 --> 35:21.038
And I think you know
I'm the type of man

35:21.072 --> 35:23.540
that's not gonna
just wipe his mouth.

35:27.011 --> 35:29.046
How much do you got
on you just now?

35:34.986 --> 35:37.922
I can give you
like a oner innit.

35:39.056 --> 35:41.158
Spencer, I'll put a tan

35:43.194 --> 35:47.164
right down the side
of your fucking jaw

35:47.198 --> 35:49.934
if I think that you're
taking the piss.

35:49.967 --> 35:52.736
And right now I think you are.

35:53.737 --> 35:54.972
Give me all of it.

35:55.006 --> 35:57.875
- It's a week's wages.
- I don't give a fuck!

35:59.010 --> 36:00.144
You owe me.

36:04.949 --> 36:08.085
Nah, I'm going to introduce you

36:08.119 --> 36:09.619
to my new partner, Weasel.

36:11.989 --> 36:14.724
He's going to be making
collections for me from now on.

36:17.228 --> 36:19.931
Hmm, I do believe
we've already met.

36:19.964 --> 36:21.665
You do recognize me, don't ya?

36:23.200 --> 36:25.836
What, you don't remember me nah?

36:26.971 --> 36:29.173
How about now?

36:29.206 --> 36:32.176
Yeah, it's all coming back
to you now, innit boy?

36:32.209 --> 36:34.477
Pop, pop, shank, shank.

36:34.511 --> 36:36.513
Remember me now, didn't ya?

36:36.546 --> 36:38.950
just so you understand
all right, this,

36:38.983 --> 36:40.717
this is just interest.

36:40.750 --> 36:42.219
You still owe five grand.

36:42.253 --> 36:45.923
The longer you take to get
the more you pay, comprende?

36:47.091 --> 36:49.894
- Ginge, I can't...
- Shut the fuck up man!

36:49.927 --> 36:52.729
I've already told you it's
me you're dealing with now.

36:53.563 --> 36:54.198
Give me that.

36:56.200 --> 36:58.803
Weasel will come
back next week.

36:58.836 --> 37:00.938
That's unless you give
it to me before then.

37:03.274 --> 37:06.010
Don't be getting no
funny ideas, all right.

37:06.043 --> 37:07.644
Best to leave things in the past

37:08.645 --> 37:11.015
or you might not have a future.

37:11.048 --> 37:12.049
You get what I'm saying?

37:13.683 --> 37:15.953
Take me about five minutes
to find out where you live.

37:17.054 --> 37:17.888
You get me?

37:21.658 --> 37:23.761
You know the score, wee man.

37:23.794 --> 37:28.065
This is how it works so
go on and get tae fuck.

37:29.800 --> 37:30.633
Come on.

37:32.136 --> 37:33.037
Pussy hole.

37:58.029 --> 37:59.562
You're playing well, Jack.

37:59.596 --> 38:02.599
We're done but look at
your safety next time.

38:02.632 --> 38:04.035
Okay.

38:04.068 --> 38:05.336
Sorry Qiang, I didn't
realize you were with someone.

38:05.369 --> 38:07.304
It's fine, we're done.

38:07.338 --> 38:09.572
Spencer, this is Jack.

38:09.606 --> 38:10.875
Yeah, I know
who you are, Jack.

38:10.908 --> 38:12.009
Hi Spencer.

38:12.043 --> 38:13.710
I'm coaching
Spencer for Beijing.

38:13.743 --> 38:15.246
Good luck out there, mate.

38:15.279 --> 38:16.247
Cheers, bruv.

38:16.280 --> 38:17.882
- See you soon.
- See you later.

38:18.783 --> 38:20.985
Listen, look Qiang,
I've come here,

38:21.018 --> 38:22.086
but I can't play today, mate.

38:22.119 --> 38:24.687
It's pointless, my
head's not in it.

38:24.721 --> 38:26.190
You want to talk about it?

38:26.223 --> 38:27.958
Let's go and have a coffee.

38:27.992 --> 38:29.794
Shelly, two coffees, please.

39:13.104 --> 39:14.071
I understand.

39:16.941 --> 39:17.775
Thanks.

39:20.111 --> 39:21.879
Well, given everything
you've just told me,

39:21.912 --> 39:24.148
I'm not surprised
you're feeling anxious.

39:24.181 --> 39:26.083
Does your dad know any of this?

39:26.117 --> 39:27.852
He wouldn't be interested.

39:27.885 --> 39:29.652
Give him a chance,
he's a good man.

39:29.686 --> 39:31.989
Yeah, that judge
didn't think so, did he?

39:32.022 --> 39:35.092
Well, I've known
your dad since 1993

39:35.126 --> 39:37.094
at an exhibition I played.

39:37.128 --> 39:38.329
He worked the doors.

39:38.362 --> 39:41.765
He knew some bad people,
but as far as I'm aware

39:41.799 --> 39:44.135
he drove the car and
got caught first time.

39:45.336 --> 39:48.906
Yeah, well he was shit at
being a dad and a villain then.

39:50.241 --> 39:52.276
He's trying
Spencer, he's trying.

40:02.319 --> 40:04.121
You all right?

40:04.155 --> 40:07.391
You've hardly said
a word all night.

40:07.424 --> 40:10.794
I'm just tired.

40:10.828 --> 40:12.429
Oh, I've nearly forgotten,

40:12.463 --> 40:13.864
a mate of your
knocked here today.

40:13.898 --> 40:15.065
What was his name?

40:16.400 --> 40:17.201
Weasel?

40:20.304 --> 40:21.105
Weasel?

40:23.740 --> 40:25.708
Weasel knocked here?

40:25.742 --> 40:26.977
What did he want?

40:27.011 --> 40:28.245
Just asked if you were in

40:28.279 --> 40:30.981
and said to tell you
that he'd call by.

40:31.015 --> 40:32.349
Why, who was he?

40:32.383 --> 40:34.919
I never heard you
mention his name before.

40:34.952 --> 40:35.786
He's no one.

40:37.087 --> 40:38.155
It's all good.

40:53.003 --> 40:53.837
Nice shot.

40:55.806 --> 40:57.341
Did you just take
a picture of my bum?

40:57.374 --> 41:00.477
Nah, I'm joking,
course I didn't, look.

41:00.511 --> 41:02.780
Vincent had to go somewhere.

41:02.813 --> 41:05.182
So he asked if I could play a
few frames till he gets back.

41:05.216 --> 41:06.450
Oh yeah?

41:06.483 --> 41:08.452
Do you know how?

41:08.485 --> 41:10.287
Set em up and
then we'll find out.

41:15.993 --> 41:18.295
Want to make this a
bit more interesting?

41:18.329 --> 41:21.265
Hm, no I don't
gamble with my money.

41:21.298 --> 41:23.901
What about a fun bit
then, like a forfeit.

41:23.934 --> 41:26.337
If I win, you got to
spend the night with me.

41:26.370 --> 41:28.172
Well, I'll give you a headstart.

41:28.205 --> 41:30.274
50 'cause you're a girl.

41:30.307 --> 41:32.776
A lewd proposition
followed by a sexist comment.

41:32.810 --> 41:34.278
What a gentlemen.

41:34.311 --> 41:35.279
No, I meant like dinner
or drinks or something.

41:35.312 --> 41:38.382
I know exactly what you meant.

41:38.415 --> 41:39.216
You're on.

41:40.317 --> 41:41.218
You can break.

41:44.321 --> 41:48.225
All right, I'll make
this one easier for you.

41:57.001 --> 41:58.302
Am I doing it right?

41:58.335 --> 42:00.838
Yeah, looks all right to me.

42:04.942 --> 42:06.310
I've underestimated
you, ain't I?

42:06.343 --> 42:08.512
What, with a 50 head start?

42:08.545 --> 42:10.180
I think the writing's
on the wall.

42:10.214 --> 42:11.815
What do you mean?

42:14.985 --> 42:16.954
What, you done all this?

42:16.987 --> 42:19.023
What have I let myself in for?

42:19.056 --> 42:22.359
What have you let
yourself in for?

42:22.393 --> 42:24.828
Yeah, what have I
let myself in for?

42:24.862 --> 42:28.032
Well, if I win,

42:28.065 --> 42:29.900
you have to spend
the night with me

42:29.933 --> 42:31.802
and I don't mean
drinks and dinner.

42:36.407 --> 42:37.441
I ain't wearing that.

42:37.474 --> 42:39.476
Yes you are, you lost.

42:40.577 --> 42:42.246
Now put them on.

43:01.465 --> 43:03.901
That seriously all you got?

43:17.214 --> 43:18.048
Woohoo!

43:20.451 --> 43:21.552
Strike!

43:21.585 --> 43:23.187
Calm down, what you doing?

43:23.220 --> 43:26.290
I'm having fun,
what are you doing?

43:26.323 --> 43:28.325
You need to stop taking
yourself so seriously.

44:11.368 --> 44:12.603
I had a really
good time tonight.

44:12.636 --> 44:14.171
- Really?
- Yeah.

44:20.511 --> 44:24.448
Vincent Qiang, my old
friend, how are you?

44:24.481 --> 44:27.050
Monty, Spencer Pryde.

44:27.084 --> 44:28.552
How you doing son,
pleased to meet ya.

44:28.585 --> 44:31.021
All right, so this
is the boy, is it?

44:31.054 --> 44:32.055
Is he a good, can he play?

44:32.089 --> 44:33.557
He's a natural.

44:33.590 --> 44:35.359
A bit rough around
the edges, maybe,

44:35.392 --> 44:37.394
but like a diamond
just needs polishing.

44:37.428 --> 44:39.696
Yeah, and you're just
the man to do it and all.

44:40.697 --> 44:42.499
Qiang, the diamond merchant.

44:42.533 --> 44:44.034
I like it, I like it.

44:44.067 --> 44:45.402
Oh, this is Dao Leung.

44:45.436 --> 44:46.336
Where'd you find him?

44:46.370 --> 44:48.272
Well, I found him in Chinatown

44:48.305 --> 44:50.441
hustling the tables
for a few quid.

44:50.474 --> 44:53.343
Got him a coach, put
him into some locals.

44:53.377 --> 44:55.279
He wiped the floor with
some very good opponents.

44:55.312 --> 44:56.613
Didn't you, son?

44:56.647 --> 44:58.282
Dao Leung.

45:02.619 --> 45:04.288
All right, all right,
English, English.

45:04.321 --> 45:07.591
I don't want you poaching
my players, you old pirate.

45:07.624 --> 45:09.326
Relax, we're just
talking about Beijing.

45:09.359 --> 45:11.395
Yeah, actually we're going
too, so we'll see you there.

45:11.428 --> 45:13.430
Oh, I wanted a word
with you about that.

45:16.066 --> 45:17.701
All right, Spencer?

45:17.734 --> 45:19.436
Yeah, you all right, uh...

45:19.470 --> 45:21.038
Daggers, call me Daggers.

45:21.071 --> 45:22.339
- Call.
- Heads.

45:23.507 --> 45:25.209
All right fellas,
it's best of nine.

45:25.242 --> 45:27.578
Daggers, you break first.

45:27.611 --> 45:29.713
All right fellas, I
want a good clean fight.

45:29.746 --> 45:32.449
No holding, no kissing,

45:32.483 --> 45:35.319
and definitely no
stroking each other's cue.

45:35.352 --> 45:37.454
Come on Flick, get on with it!

45:38.489 --> 45:40.157
Monty, you're barred.

45:52.770 --> 45:55.773
What do you say, hey Vincent?

45:55.807 --> 45:57.174
Let's keep it friendly.

45:57.207 --> 45:58.475
500 sounds good.

46:21.565 --> 46:23.400
Take your time.

46:23.433 --> 46:25.803
Save the impossible shots
for the practice table.

46:27.170 --> 46:28.305
I never knew you
to play it safe.

46:28.338 --> 46:30.340
Let the boy miss if he wants to.

46:30.374 --> 46:32.376
He's missed enough already.

46:32.409 --> 46:34.144
Sorry, bad joke.

46:43.720 --> 46:45.489
One nil to Daggers.

46:47.658 --> 46:49.660
Well done my son, well played.

46:52.729 --> 46:54.131
Four more.

46:54.164 --> 46:55.800
Four more frames of
pain for you, Vincent.

47:11.883 --> 47:14.418
Is he playing left-handed?

47:15.118 --> 47:16.520
He's taking the piss, ain't he?

47:16.553 --> 47:18.388
Don't concern yourself
with what he's doing.

47:18.422 --> 47:19.556
Do what you've got to do.

48:09.539 --> 48:12.609
Score stands at
Daggers three, Pryde two.

48:12.643 --> 48:13.811
There will now be
a brief interval

48:13.845 --> 48:16.647
as the ref is busting
his balls for a piss

48:16.680 --> 48:17.614
and needs a cigarette.

48:19.683 --> 48:21.618
Got a light on you, fella?

48:33.998 --> 48:34.832
Sweet, cheers, mate.

48:36.901 --> 48:38.803
It's all right, bruv.

50:03.755 --> 50:05.823
Daggers wins the
frame and the match,

50:05.857 --> 50:07.557
five frames to two.

50:07.591 --> 50:10.527
Yes, well done Daggers!

50:13.965 --> 50:15.499
Good match, Spencer.

50:15.532 --> 50:16.834
Hope to see you in Beijing.

50:16.868 --> 50:17.969
Yeah, whatever, mate.

50:19.436 --> 50:20.905
Oh, looks like
you got yourself

50:20.938 --> 50:23.074
a bit of a bad loser
there, eh Vincent?

50:23.107 --> 50:24.909
I think he's just a
bit annoyed at himself.

50:24.942 --> 50:26.010
I don't know what
happened to him.

50:26.043 --> 50:27.945
Different player
after the break.

50:27.979 --> 50:29.046
I'm not surprised.

50:29.080 --> 50:30.614
I'm amazed he could stand up.

50:30.647 --> 50:31.916
What are you talking about?

50:31.949 --> 50:33.851
Caught him out front
smoking a big reefer.

50:33.885 --> 50:35.019
Not sure if it's
that nutty skunk,

50:35.052 --> 50:36.586
but it didn't half smell strong.

50:36.620 --> 50:39.322
Ah, what a shame, aye?

50:39.356 --> 50:40.792
Decent player and all.

50:40.825 --> 50:42.659
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

50:42.692 --> 50:43.995
Why the hell
would you do that?

50:44.028 --> 50:45.863
I was trying to
calm my nerves.

50:45.897 --> 50:47.664
I thought I was having a
panic attack, all right.

50:47.697 --> 50:48.833
Bullshit.

50:48.866 --> 50:50.902
Do I look like a
fucking idiot to you?

50:50.935 --> 50:52.069
You know what I think?

50:52.103 --> 50:54.939
You're so scared of
failing that you fuck up

50:54.972 --> 50:57.041
on purpose so you
have an excuse.

50:57.074 --> 50:57.875
Sorry.

50:57.909 --> 50:59.043
Sorry?

50:59.076 --> 51:00.845
I'm sorry, Spencer
because there is no way

51:00.878 --> 51:03.781
I'm investing my time
and money in you.

51:03.815 --> 51:05.482
You're a bad risk.

51:05.515 --> 51:07.785
Unless you can finance this
thing yourself, forget it.

51:28.438 --> 51:30.808
What you gonna do then?

51:30.842 --> 51:32.143
What can I do?

51:32.176 --> 51:33.811
I can't come up with
the money by Friday.

51:33.845 --> 51:35.712
He knows that an all,
couldn't wait to drop me.

51:36.746 --> 51:39.050
Fuck him, anyway, larging it
up in his shitty little club,

51:39.083 --> 51:40.684
treating me like
some sort of joey.

51:40.717 --> 51:43.087
You need to start taking
responsibility for your actions.

51:43.120 --> 51:44.454
Fuck that's supposed to mean?

51:44.487 --> 51:45.589
Wasn't him that smoked drugs

51:45.622 --> 51:46.858
in the middle of a game, was it?

51:46.891 --> 51:48.826
Oh, might have known
you've taken his side.

51:49.861 --> 51:50.828
His side?

51:53.463 --> 51:54.866
Do you know what, I'm done.

51:54.899 --> 51:56.399
I can't sit here and listen
to you blame everyone

51:56.433 --> 51:57.634
but yourself for
your fucked up life.

51:57.667 --> 51:59.871
It's frustrating,
you're frustrating.

51:59.904 --> 52:01.038
Well, fuck off then.

52:02.606 --> 52:03.808
I don't need you anyway.

52:03.841 --> 52:05.076
Driving about in your
flashy little motor,

52:05.109 --> 52:07.144
silver spoon hanging out
the side of your mouth.

52:07.178 --> 52:08.112
You think you're better than me?

52:08.145 --> 52:09.814
Oh really?

52:09.847 --> 52:12.817
I've worked hard for every
fucking penny I've got.

52:12.850 --> 52:14.718
Maybe you should try it
instead of running around

52:14.751 --> 52:15.987
with your muggy little mates.

52:18.990 --> 52:20.958
And I don't think
I'm better than you.

52:20.992 --> 52:23.526
I think you're better than you.

52:37.208 --> 52:38.042
Raise.

52:45.582 --> 52:46.984
Here's your drink, Ray.

52:47.018 --> 52:48.886
Down to you,
Ginger me old son.

52:54.025 --> 52:54.892
Fuck it, fold.

52:59.230 --> 53:00.064
Yeah, I'm out.

53:01.098 --> 53:01.933
Check.

53:03.134 --> 53:04.902
John, you can't.

53:04.936 --> 53:06.904
I just raised it.

53:06.938 --> 53:07.905
You raised it?

53:09.974 --> 53:12.709
I didn't hear you raise it.

53:12.742 --> 53:13.643
Did he raise?

53:13.677 --> 53:16.213
No need to ask him, he folded.

53:17.580 --> 53:18.916
Just you know, don't be afraid.

53:19.984 --> 53:20.918
Just play.

53:22.053 --> 53:22.853
I'm thinking.

53:26.791 --> 53:27.691
You're thinking.

53:28.993 --> 53:30.928
If you're thinking
you're fucking yourself.

53:31.963 --> 53:33.530
I'm considering my options.

53:39.736 --> 53:40.570
Folded.

53:41.305 --> 53:42.139
Good man.

53:43.274 --> 53:45.009
Look at all that
dough, Spence.

53:45.042 --> 53:46.710
Do you right now, wouldn't it?

53:46.743 --> 53:48.611
Shut up, Mike, I
ain't in the mood.

53:50.114 --> 53:52.083
I mean, I ain't
being funny but

53:52.116 --> 53:53.951
what are you gonna
do with your life?

53:55.119 --> 53:57.054
For the past few
weeks you've become

53:57.088 --> 53:58.189
an unemployed drug dealer,

53:59.556 --> 54:00.958
become a washed
up snooker player,

54:02.625 --> 54:03.961
oh and now your
bird's dumped ya.

54:06.263 --> 54:08.165
I ain't a washed
up anything, Clark.

54:08.199 --> 54:09.566
I'm still playing
in that tournament.

54:09.599 --> 54:11.601
With what, you
ain't got no money.

54:11.634 --> 54:13.070
I've got money, bruv.

54:13.104 --> 54:14.704
Yeah, if you got money,
you should pay Ginger.

54:14.738 --> 54:15.973
Shut up you idiot.

54:17.775 --> 54:20.144
If you do business with
someone, you should pay up.

54:20.177 --> 54:21.846
You just said you got money,
so what's the problem?

54:22.679 --> 54:23.546
Pay up, Spence.

54:30.687 --> 54:31.688
Ginge.

54:35.960 --> 54:36.794
Ginger.

54:43.868 --> 54:46.971
You little fucking prick.

54:47.004 --> 54:47.938
You and your little muggy mates

54:47.972 --> 54:49.173
are taking the piss outta me?

54:49.206 --> 54:50.107
We wasn't taking the...

54:50.141 --> 54:52.143
You think it's a fucking joke?

54:52.176 --> 54:53.643
Give me your fucking hand!

54:53.676 --> 54:55.012
Give me your hand.

54:55.980 --> 54:59.884
I am gonna smash your
fucking hands to bits.

55:02.086 --> 55:05.022
Gentlemen, I
hate to bother you,

55:06.824 --> 55:09.093
but we're playing a card game.

55:09.126 --> 55:13.030
What are you playing,
Tom and fucking Jerry?

55:13.064 --> 55:15.032
Sorry, what's your point?

55:15.966 --> 55:18.069
I got a winning
hand, that's my point.

55:19.236 --> 55:21.305
Now here's what needs to happen?

55:21.338 --> 55:26.210
You go back in there,
sit down, take your cards

55:26.243 --> 55:30.114
and apologize for
being a dickhead.

55:30.147 --> 55:33.250
Then you'll throw
your hand on the table

55:34.717 --> 55:37.254
you raise your voice
when you say, "I fold".

55:38.389 --> 55:39.223
Fold?

55:40.257 --> 55:42.093
Why would I fold?

55:44.829 --> 55:46.197
That's how I win.

55:47.264 --> 55:49.133
You're doing me a favor, right?

55:55.172 --> 55:57.241
I want a grand
from you next week,

55:57.274 --> 55:59.676
or I'll break both your
arms, you wee fanny.

56:03.746 --> 56:06.851
You know, Alena doesn't
always get it right

56:06.884 --> 56:09.086
but she thinks
you're a good kid.

56:09.954 --> 56:13.124
Clean up your bloody
mess before you leave.

57:01.138 --> 57:02.672
You could move in here.

57:04.275 --> 57:05.309
There's a spare room.

57:07.044 --> 57:09.146
No, I don't think he
would like that much.

57:10.347 --> 57:12.216
I'm happy where I
am, Kath, I's fine.

57:30.868 --> 57:32.336
You know what?

57:32.369 --> 57:36.974
I was thinking, if you do you
want to do something for me

57:38.142 --> 57:41.278
you could always,
erm...

57:44.548 --> 57:46.150
Do one for the road.

57:46.183 --> 57:47.251
- Really?
- Yeah.

57:48.986 --> 57:53.224
Well, we'll have to see
what we can do about that.

58:08.839 --> 58:11.041
- Your dad's here.
- Don't want to speak to him.

58:25.422 --> 58:28.292
He only came around
to give you this.

58:28.325 --> 58:30.494
It's for your trip to
China and the tournament.

58:47.578 --> 58:48.379
Terry.

58:51.448 --> 58:52.249
Thank you.

58:53.150 --> 58:56.253
For the money I know I
don't deserve it, so...

58:58.856 --> 59:00.324
Oh don't say that.

59:02.493 --> 59:04.328
Look, we all make
mistakes in life.

59:06.230 --> 59:07.264
I've made more than most.

59:08.899 --> 59:10.334
So just consider it as an
early birthday present,

59:10.367 --> 59:15.372
or you know, a late one for
the ones I missed, all right.

59:19.476 --> 59:24.281
I'll let you down, I
will, I'll let you down.

59:26.317 --> 59:29.253
Well then we'll
be quits, won't we.

59:31.355 --> 59:32.856
Look, I'll call Qiang in
the morning, all right,

59:32.890 --> 59:35.025
I'll tell him that
you got the money.

59:35.059 --> 59:37.361
Don't think he'll want
anything to do with me, Dad.

59:37.394 --> 59:39.830
Don't worry about
it, I'll speak to him.

59:45.903 --> 59:47.871
Listen, why don't you
give that stuff a miss,

59:47.905 --> 59:49.139
you know, the waccy baccy.

59:49.173 --> 59:51.375
It's not good for
your game, is it?

59:51.408 --> 59:52.309
It's not good for you.

59:58.248 --> 59:59.483
Where your van?

01:00:02.353 --> 01:00:03.320
I sold it.

01:00:05.055 --> 01:00:07.191
You know, maybe when you're a
rich and famous snooker player

01:00:07.224 --> 01:00:09.960
maybe you can buy me a new one.

01:00:10.994 --> 01:00:12.396
Maybe.

01:00:12.429 --> 01:00:13.530
Hey, well I worked
for a Rolls Royce.

01:00:13.564 --> 01:00:15.065
Don't push it.

01:00:19.536 --> 01:00:20.337
I'll see ya.

01:00:21.372 --> 01:00:22.339
See ya, mate.

01:00:52.469 --> 01:00:54.371
That's a lovely phone, that.

01:00:54.405 --> 01:00:55.439
Let me use it, my
battery's gone.

01:00:55.472 --> 01:00:57.174
No, it's mine.

01:00:59.576 --> 01:01:01.378
I didn't ask
whose phone it was.

01:01:03.247 --> 01:01:05.015
Give me the phone
you little prick.

01:01:14.024 --> 01:01:14.658
Pussy.

01:01:25.202 --> 01:01:27.337
So what does
your brief reckon?

01:01:27.371 --> 01:01:28.672
A year, 18 months maybe.

01:01:30.507 --> 01:01:32.676
Oh, we messed up
big time, didn't we?

01:01:32.709 --> 01:01:34.378
Should've flipped
them burgers, bruv.

01:01:37.514 --> 01:01:38.549
Seriously though, when I get out

01:01:38.582 --> 01:01:40.617
I'm going to start using this.

01:01:40.651 --> 01:01:43.020
Yeah, that won't get
you very far, will it?

01:01:43.053 --> 01:01:43.687
Fuck off.

01:01:48.258 --> 01:01:49.493
That's it.

01:01:49.526 --> 01:01:51.228
Listen, thanks for
coming though, yeah.

01:01:51.261 --> 01:01:52.429
Of course, cheers.

01:01:52.463 --> 01:01:53.597
Contact, Taylor.

01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:54.665
Yeah, all right Yatey,
you can calm down.

01:01:54.698 --> 01:01:56.433
Yeah, yeah, less
of the lip, son.

01:02:07.611 --> 01:02:09.079
Surprise!

01:02:09.112 --> 01:02:13.550
Oh happy birthday
baby, look who's here.

01:02:13.584 --> 01:02:16.119
Sorry, I didn't know
it was your birthday.

01:02:16.153 --> 01:02:17.789
I just came to give you this.

01:02:17.822 --> 01:02:19.122
You left it in my car.

01:02:19.791 --> 01:02:20.624
Cool.

01:02:25.095 --> 01:02:27.164
This one's from Nanny.

01:02:27.197 --> 01:02:28.165
All right.

01:02:32.603 --> 01:02:34.505
Ah, that's nice
innit, bless her,

01:02:34.538 --> 01:02:35.539
she ain't got much money.

01:02:35.572 --> 01:02:37.474
Yeah, I'll phone her later.

01:02:37.508 --> 01:02:38.375
That's from me.

01:02:44.548 --> 01:02:45.582
Oh, thanks mum.

01:02:45.616 --> 01:02:46.617
You're welcome, baby.

01:02:54.324 --> 01:02:56.126
I'm sorry about the other day.

01:02:56.159 --> 01:02:57.127
I was out of order.

01:02:58.495 --> 01:03:00.631
No, you was right.

01:03:00.664 --> 01:03:02.232
Qiang was right.

01:03:02.266 --> 01:03:04.601
I'm scared of failing.

01:03:04.635 --> 01:03:06.136
He's very insightful.

01:03:07.538 --> 01:03:09.706
My foster mom used to
call him the wise old owl.

01:03:10.875 --> 01:03:13.577
Foster mom, I
thought you was...

01:03:13.610 --> 01:03:16.680
Yeah, I know silver spoon.

01:03:17.849 --> 01:03:19.516
In and out of care
most of my life.

01:03:20.384 --> 01:03:21.786
If you're lucky,
you might get to see

01:03:21.819 --> 01:03:23.353
my cigarette burns one day.

01:03:25.622 --> 01:03:28.292
If you ever want to talk,
do you know what I mean.

01:03:28.325 --> 01:03:30.527
I don't need a shrink, Spence.

01:03:30.561 --> 01:03:32.095
You might, though.

01:03:32.129 --> 01:03:33.630
Yeah, maybe.

01:03:33.664 --> 01:03:36.700
There's nothing wrong
with failing Spencer.

01:03:36.733 --> 01:03:39.169
As long as you don't
give up without a fight.

01:03:42.472 --> 01:03:44.541
Yeah, well it's out
of my hands now, innit.

01:03:45.676 --> 01:03:47.411
I owe a bloke a lot of money

01:03:47.444 --> 01:03:48.712
and if I don't give
him a grand by day,

01:03:48.745 --> 01:03:50.547
he'll probably
break my arms, so.

01:03:53.684 --> 01:03:55.385
Happy birthday, Spencer boy!

01:03:57.554 --> 01:03:59.723
Look, I've got you, well
I've got you a present.

01:04:00.758 --> 01:04:01.592
Thanks.

01:04:04.461 --> 01:04:05.662
It's a good one.

01:04:05.696 --> 01:04:07.698
Yeah, I know, I can
feel it, it's good.

01:04:09.299 --> 01:04:11.535
O'Sullivan uses uses
the same one, apparently.

01:04:15.172 --> 01:04:17.741
Did you fill out
your entry form?

01:04:17.775 --> 01:04:19.509
Yeah, it's just
there on the side.

01:04:19.543 --> 01:04:20.377
Yeah.

01:04:24.715 --> 01:04:26.216
Yeah, 'cause I'm going
over to Qiang's now.

01:04:26.249 --> 01:04:28.352
I was thinking if you want,
I can drop it over to him.

01:04:28.385 --> 01:04:29.586
You still got the money?

01:04:34.524 --> 01:04:35.592
Yeah.

01:04:35.626 --> 01:04:37.594
Yeah, it's there in the bag.

01:04:38.662 --> 01:04:40.263
Good boy.

01:04:40.297 --> 01:04:45.302
Okay, so Dagger's
sponsor, Monty is it?

01:04:46.269 --> 01:04:47.671
He reckons he's gonna
walk the tournament

01:04:47.704 --> 01:04:48.739
and I'm thinking well,
you're going to give him

01:04:48.773 --> 01:04:49.774
a run for his money.

01:04:51.876 --> 01:04:53.510
Well look, cheer up.

01:04:53.543 --> 01:04:55.178
This is your passport's a
big time, isn't it, remember.

01:04:56.213 --> 01:04:57.614
Yeah, I must have forgot, eh.

01:05:00.952 --> 01:05:03.520
Well look, I've got to
go, I'll see you later,

01:05:03.553 --> 01:05:04.655
but happy birthday, yeah.

01:05:05.823 --> 01:05:07.324
I'll show you out.

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.962
Thanks again Ter for the cue.

01:05:10.995 --> 01:05:11.829
It's appreciated.

01:05:17.769 --> 01:05:19.837
Doubt, he'd still be
using a two piece, eh.

01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:27.644
Sure this is a good idea?

01:05:29.814 --> 01:05:31.715
It's like you said,

01:05:31.748 --> 01:05:35.485
I've got to take responsibility
for my actions now.

01:05:37.755 --> 01:05:38.890
Mind you, I'd keep
the engine running.

01:05:38.923 --> 01:05:39.824
If he says no, I'll
probably be out of there

01:05:39.857 --> 01:05:41.859
quicker than Usain Bolt.

01:05:55.439 --> 01:05:56.841
You got my fucking money?

01:05:58.976 --> 01:06:00.711
Man asked you a
fucking question!

01:06:03.346 --> 01:06:04.581
I need more time.

01:06:04.614 --> 01:06:06.984
Spencer, you've had
enough fucking time.

01:06:07.018 --> 01:06:08.285
Take it easy.

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.022
All due respect Ray, this
is none of your business.

01:06:11.055 --> 01:06:12.857
Don't you use that
tone of voice on me.

01:06:12.890 --> 01:06:15.726
All right, I hear you
and and I apologize.

01:06:17.895 --> 01:06:19.764
It's a big man's club.

01:06:19.797 --> 01:06:20.765
Outside.

01:06:20.798 --> 01:06:21.799
Nah, I just need 10 more days.

01:06:21.833 --> 01:06:23.734
Too late, outside now!

01:06:23.768 --> 01:06:25.502
Oi!

01:06:25.535 --> 01:06:26.871
Let him go.

01:06:26.904 --> 01:06:28.840
Listen, this ain't got
nothing to do with you old man,

01:06:28.873 --> 01:06:30.340
all right, just play
your game innit.

01:06:30.373 --> 01:06:33.845
Would you like me to
put manners on the prick?

01:06:35.079 --> 01:06:39.784
Why don't we play another
game, like a Russian roulette.

01:06:41.551 --> 01:06:43.755
Listen, I'm sorry all
right, it won't happen again.

01:06:47.324 --> 01:06:50.560
You're still alive
lucky man, piss off.

01:06:52.596 --> 01:06:54.766
You, come here.

01:06:59.871 --> 01:07:03.040
I remember when you
walk in here at first.

01:07:04.708 --> 01:07:06.778
You were a snotty little kid.

01:07:06.811 --> 01:07:08.411
You loved snooker.

01:07:09.312 --> 01:07:13.550
You had talent and
then I watched you grow

01:07:13.583 --> 01:07:15.485
and you didn't do
anything about it.

01:07:18.622 --> 01:07:19.456
It's a shame.

01:07:23.727 --> 01:07:24.796
How much does he owe you?

01:07:25.830 --> 01:07:26.931
Five, five grand Ray.

01:07:29.666 --> 01:07:30.768
I'll take care of it.

01:07:32.602 --> 01:07:33.838
What?

01:07:33.871 --> 01:07:36.007
You'll have your
money tomorrow.

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:38.876
And you owe me
five grand plus 10%

01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:39.777
and I'll give you

01:07:43.647 --> 01:07:45.315
11 days to pay me back.

01:07:48.853 --> 01:07:50.822
Now, get the fuck out of here.

01:07:57.727 --> 01:08:00.397
What the fuck
have I just done?

01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:01.933
I think they
call it jumping out

01:08:01.966 --> 01:08:03.433
the frying pan into the fire.

01:08:07.839 --> 01:08:09.040
Sorry, bad joke.

01:08:12.709 --> 01:08:13.710
Come on, let's go.

01:08:20.517 --> 01:08:22.685
Leaps and bounds,
I'm telling you.

01:08:30.895 --> 01:08:32.662
Nice, nice.

01:08:37.434 --> 01:08:38.870
Hello Spencer,
how are you doing?

01:08:39.970 --> 01:08:40.971
You don't look so well.

01:08:42.639 --> 01:08:44.506
Actually, I feel like shit
but thanks for your concern.

01:08:45.675 --> 01:08:47.544
Recognize him, do ya?

01:08:47.577 --> 01:08:49.511
He's helping Dao
refine his game.

01:08:52.082 --> 01:08:53.483
So what can I do for ya?

01:08:54.451 --> 01:08:56.921
Yeah, well I hear you
feel pretty confident

01:08:56.953 --> 01:08:58.555
about the tournament.

01:08:58.587 --> 01:08:59.991
Well, you heard wrong.

01:09:00.024 --> 01:09:02.591
I'm supremely confident.

01:09:02.626 --> 01:09:03.961
How's he doing coach?

01:09:03.995 --> 01:09:05.162
Yeah, he's doing well.

01:09:05.196 --> 01:09:07.932
Thing is, I'm feeling
pretty confident too.

01:09:07.965 --> 01:09:10.801
Good, I'm glad to hear it.

01:09:10.835 --> 01:09:13.203
Yeah, in fact when we played
I was having an off day.

01:09:13.237 --> 01:09:14.839
Yeah, skunk would
do that to you.

01:09:14.872 --> 01:09:16.439
What's that, pal?

01:09:16.473 --> 01:09:18.175
I broke my hand a while back.

01:09:18.209 --> 01:09:19.944
The plaster came off
the day before we played

01:09:19.977 --> 01:09:21.879
and I still beat
you left-handed.

01:09:21.912 --> 01:09:23.881
So don't come in here
with your fucking excuses.

01:09:23.915 --> 01:09:25.649
How bout we take my excuses
outside, how bout that?

01:09:26.649 --> 01:09:28.019
Concentrate!

01:09:28.051 --> 01:09:29.020
Get to the point
Spencer, what do you want?

01:09:29.053 --> 01:09:30.420
I want a wager.

01:09:31.554 --> 01:09:32.622
Me versus him.

01:09:36.093 --> 01:09:37.929
I don't mean to
insult you, Spencer,

01:09:37.962 --> 01:09:39.095
but I'll give you
odds three to one

01:09:39.130 --> 01:09:41.799
against you beating Dao
any day of the week.

01:09:41.832 --> 01:09:43.901
You are a waster.

01:09:44.902 --> 01:09:47.071
Go on then, put your
money where your mouth is.

01:09:48.773 --> 01:09:52.042
I know you, Shelly right?

01:09:52.076 --> 01:09:54.544
You won the under
21's a few years ago.

01:09:54.577 --> 01:09:57.747
Yeah, I think a beat one
of your girls in the final.

01:09:57.782 --> 01:09:59.817
Well, let me give
you a bit of advice.

01:09:59.850 --> 01:10:01.718
You got more chance
of beating him

01:10:01.751 --> 01:10:03.486
than this dope head, here.

01:10:04.255 --> 01:10:05.923
What's wrong, are you scared?

01:10:07.158 --> 01:10:10.928
This game, I assume we're
talking about the tournament.

01:10:13.097 --> 01:10:15.498
All right then, how much?

01:10:16.733 --> 01:10:17.768
Five grand.

01:10:18.936 --> 01:10:21.471
Five grant, got
five grand, have you?

01:10:22.807 --> 01:10:23.740
Yeah, I've got it
but I won't need it.

01:10:23.774 --> 01:10:25.910
Well, I'll need to see it.

01:10:25.943 --> 01:10:28.946
You see, if I'm going to give
you odds of three to one,

01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:31.514
I'm going to need a
little bit of insurance.

01:10:31.548 --> 01:10:33.050
I'll tell you what,

01:10:33.084 --> 01:10:35.719
you show me the
money and you're on.

01:10:40.091 --> 01:10:41.591
I didn't think so.

01:10:44.862 --> 01:10:45.997
It's parked outside.

01:10:58.608 --> 01:11:00.177
Is that your motor,
is it sweetheart?

01:11:00.211 --> 01:11:01.979
Yeah, it's mine.

01:11:02.013 --> 01:11:03.613
It's worth more than five grand.

01:11:06.317 --> 01:11:09.053
Dao, how do you
fancy a new motor?

01:11:09.086 --> 01:11:10.187
What color is it?

01:11:10.221 --> 01:11:11.022
Red.

01:11:11.055 --> 01:11:12.189
That's my lucky color.

01:11:19.629 --> 01:11:21.766
All right then, you're on.

01:11:23.167 --> 01:11:24.201
And may the best man win.

01:11:38.949 --> 01:11:39.817
That's it then.

01:11:40.851 --> 01:11:41.718
That's it then.

01:11:45.389 --> 01:11:49.226
No one's ever done anything
like that for me before.

01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:51.028
You won't regret it.

01:11:52.396 --> 01:11:54.231
This car is my pride and joy.

01:11:54.265 --> 01:11:56.067
I regretted it the
moment I said it.

01:11:58.668 --> 01:11:59.904
Thanks, yeah.

01:12:03.107 --> 01:12:04.041
Go on.

01:12:17.822 --> 01:12:18.621
Have you got everything?

01:12:18.655 --> 01:12:19.290
Yeah.

01:12:20.157 --> 01:12:21.058
Bye, mum.

01:12:23.094 --> 01:12:26.063
Come here then,
give us a cuddle.

01:12:28.132 --> 01:12:29.066
Good luck.

01:12:30.267 --> 01:12:31.969
All right mum, you're
breaking my ribs.

01:12:32.002 --> 01:12:34.671
Give us a call when
you get there, all right.

01:12:34.704 --> 01:12:35.940
Don't get in any
trouble, Spence.

01:12:35.973 --> 01:12:37.408
Mum, I'm going to a
snooker hall in China.

01:12:37.441 --> 01:12:38.275
I'll be fine.

01:12:42.113 --> 01:12:43.080
I love you, yeah.

01:12:45.850 --> 01:12:47.151
See you in a couple of days.

01:12:55.292 --> 01:12:56.093
You all right Lloyd?

01:12:56.127 --> 01:12:58.195
What's happening mate?

01:12:58.229 --> 01:13:02.032
Spencer, we've go
to go mate, come on.

01:13:02.066 --> 01:13:03.100
Give me that.

01:14:14.471 --> 01:14:16.273
Amazing, innit.

01:14:16.307 --> 01:14:17.174
Yeah.

01:14:20.211 --> 01:14:21.744
Do you want go out somewhere,

01:14:21.779 --> 01:14:24.315
have a little wonder around?

01:14:24.348 --> 01:14:25.182
Yeah.

01:15:04.255 --> 01:15:05.556
Cheers.

01:15:05.589 --> 01:15:07.424
Cheers.

01:15:07.458 --> 01:15:09.460
Here's to winning, eh.

01:15:28.045 --> 01:15:31.315
Just four matches stand
between you and the pro tour.

01:15:31.348 --> 01:15:32.349
They've made
Daggers the favorite

01:15:32.383 --> 01:15:34.118
so you could meet in the final.

01:15:35.019 --> 01:15:36.086
No problems, eh?

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:37.154
No problem for me.

01:15:40.291 --> 01:15:41.125
Spencer Pryde.

01:15:46.297 --> 01:15:47.531
Okay, we're up, eh.

01:15:47.564 --> 01:15:51.268
Remember, take your
time, play it safe, okay.

01:16:07.051 --> 01:16:08.319
Hi, that last
guy was well good.

01:16:08.352 --> 01:16:10.154
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:16:12.256 --> 01:16:17.261
Go on, son.

01:16:25.502 --> 01:16:30.307
You okay?

01:18:00.631 --> 01:18:03.333
And the winner is Dao Leung.

01:18:30.194 --> 01:18:32.429
Well done mate, well done.

01:18:38.302 --> 01:18:39.269
The final, eh.

01:18:39.303 --> 01:18:40.237
Oh yeah.

01:18:40.270 --> 01:18:42.539
It's amazing, innit.

01:18:42.573 --> 01:18:43.740
You'll be a while, then.

01:18:43.775 --> 01:18:46.009
We'll probably go out
and grab a bite to eat.

01:18:46.043 --> 01:18:47.578
Yeah, see you then.

01:18:47.611 --> 01:18:50.581
Yeah, yeah, you
too, bye love, bye.

01:18:50.614 --> 01:18:52.115
- Good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:53.417
Just landed.

01:18:53.450 --> 01:18:54.485
Ah, nice one.

01:18:54.518 --> 01:18:56.788
Anyone fancy going out?

01:18:56.821 --> 01:18:58.222
Yeah, we could do,

01:18:58.255 --> 01:19:00.457
I mean, the food here
looks pretty decent.

01:19:00.491 --> 01:19:01.692
Fancy going back
to that what was it?

01:19:01.725 --> 01:19:05.128
Houhai Bar street,
I like it there.

01:19:05.162 --> 01:19:06.630
Have a wander about.

01:19:06.663 --> 01:19:11.101
Look, if you wanna, but
let's not go too far, eh.

01:19:12.302 --> 01:19:13.203
Actually, you know
if it's all right

01:19:13.237 --> 01:19:14.705
with you two I'd rather stay.

01:19:14.738 --> 01:19:17.541
The food here is excellent.

01:19:17.574 --> 01:19:18.408
I'm just zonked.

01:19:19.643 --> 01:19:21.278
Oh, I see.

01:19:21.311 --> 01:19:23.413
We've been stuck with
the old fart Ter.

01:19:23.447 --> 01:19:24.281
Guilty.

01:19:25.783 --> 01:19:27.618
The lobster is excellent.

01:19:30.087 --> 01:19:31.622
You did well today.

01:19:31.655 --> 01:19:34.525
How'd you feel about
tomorrow, confident?

01:19:34.558 --> 01:19:35.492
Yeah, I feel good.

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:38.562
I'd feel better if you can dish
out red cards in this game.

01:19:38.595 --> 01:19:40.364
Love to send that Monty off.

01:19:40.397 --> 01:19:41.665
Did you see him?

01:19:41.698 --> 01:19:45.569
All the sarcastic clapping,
the little snarky face.

01:19:45.602 --> 01:19:47.704
No, it's just mind games.

01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:51.508
I wouldn't let it get to ya.

01:19:52.777 --> 01:19:54.378
Look, I'm just going to
go to toilet, all right.

01:19:54.411 --> 01:19:55.579
I'll be back in a minute.

01:19:57.782 --> 01:19:59.082
I reckon he
thinks he's special

01:19:59.116 --> 01:19:59.583
just cause he's
worth a few quid.

01:20:01.585 --> 01:20:03.387
Monty?

01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:04.588
He doesn't care about money.

01:20:04.621 --> 01:20:06.590
He gives most of it to charity.

01:20:06.623 --> 01:20:09.226
It's all fun and games to him.

01:20:09.259 --> 01:20:11.461
He's involving you
Spencer, that's all.

01:20:14.398 --> 01:20:15.699
You don't think
I can win, do ya?

01:20:17.835 --> 01:20:19.603
It doesn't matter
what I think,

01:20:19.636 --> 01:20:21.538
it's what you think
that's important.

01:20:22.807 --> 01:20:23.607
Excuse me.

01:20:35.719 --> 01:20:37.421
Everything okay?

01:20:37.454 --> 01:20:38.555
Yeah, it's fine, it's just
a bit of blood, that's all.

01:20:39.690 --> 01:20:41.291
It's a bit more than usual
but that's to be expected.

01:20:41.325 --> 01:20:42.359
Do you want to go
into the hospital?

01:20:42.392 --> 01:20:43.795
No, what they gonna do?

01:20:47.197 --> 01:20:50.601
Aye, come on, let's
go back out there.

01:20:50.634 --> 01:20:53.203
Maybe it's time
you tell Spencer.

01:20:53.236 --> 01:20:55.606
No, all right no.

01:20:55.639 --> 01:20:58.241
We're getting on, I don't
want any drama, I'm happy.

01:21:00.243 --> 01:21:00.878
Come on.

01:21:02.613 --> 01:21:03.747
How was I supposed to know

01:21:03.781 --> 01:21:05.616
it was all in
Chinese, wasn't it.

01:21:05.649 --> 01:21:06.450
Right, should we
have another drink?

01:21:06.483 --> 01:21:07.651
Yeah, I'll get one.

01:21:07.684 --> 01:21:09.353
No, I think we
should turn in now.

01:21:09.386 --> 01:21:10.754
He's got a final tomorrow.

01:21:10.788 --> 01:21:11.923
See, you're right Spence,
you are an old fart.

01:21:11.956 --> 01:21:14.826
Look, you go beddy
byes but I am going

01:21:14.859 --> 01:21:16.560
to have a drink with my boy.

01:21:16.593 --> 01:21:18.729
No, I said no.

01:21:18.763 --> 01:21:20.197
Come on Qiang, you
can have one more.

01:21:20.230 --> 01:21:21.732
No, I can't and
neither should you.

01:21:24.701 --> 01:21:27.604
Terry, come on, we're leaving.

01:21:28.806 --> 01:21:30.440
Terry!

01:21:30.474 --> 01:21:35.379
Ter, Ter, what's up with ya?

01:21:36.981 --> 01:21:38.382
Terry.

01:21:40.684 --> 01:21:43.520
Dad, Dad, Dad,
get an ambulance!

01:21:47.825 --> 01:21:49.459
Dad, what's wrong?

01:21:49.493 --> 01:21:50.627
I'm all right.

01:21:55.833 --> 01:21:57.835
What's wrong with him?

01:21:57.869 --> 01:22:01.238
Shh, it's all
right, it's all right.

01:22:51.588 --> 01:22:52.689
Did you know?

01:22:55.459 --> 01:22:57.929
Six or seven months
ago he had a pain

01:22:57.962 --> 01:23:00.630
in his left breast, chest.

01:23:00.664 --> 01:23:02.867
He put it down to stress,

01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:05.002
but then he found a
lump which he ignored,

01:23:06.636 --> 01:23:08.572
but it got bigger so he
alerted the prison doctors

01:23:08.605 --> 01:23:11.374
but by then it was too late.

01:23:11.408 --> 01:23:13.343
It had spread to his lungs.

01:23:16.313 --> 01:23:17.514
Why can't we do chemo?

01:23:19.917 --> 01:23:21.551
It's aggressive.

01:23:21.585 --> 01:23:23.054
Chemo could have
bought him some time

01:23:23.087 --> 01:23:25.722
but all he wanted was
enough to help you.

01:23:26.656 --> 01:23:27.959
Stop you fucking your life up.

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:33.765
Yeah, my life's
already fucked.

01:23:33.798 --> 01:23:34.731
I don't think so.

01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:37.601
He's the reason you're here,

01:23:37.634 --> 01:23:39.703
not sitting on some wall stoned.

01:23:40.905 --> 01:23:42.039
The rest is up to you.

01:23:44.776 --> 01:23:45.742
The rest?

01:23:46.878 --> 01:23:49.947
You can't expect me to play
Qiang, with him lying there.

01:23:49.981 --> 01:23:53.483
I understand shit
happens, Spencer.

01:23:53.517 --> 01:23:55.853
Life is a continuous
stream of events,

01:23:55.887 --> 01:23:58.588
incidents and experiences.

01:23:58.622 --> 01:24:00.690
But what matters is
how you deal with it.

01:24:01.926 --> 01:24:02.960
You want to throw the towel in,

01:24:02.994 --> 01:24:06.396
that's fine, but
know this, Terry,

01:24:09.801 --> 01:24:11.769
he'd want you to
play the final, eh.

01:24:18.843 --> 01:24:21.779
This is it, this is it innit?

01:24:52.810 --> 01:24:54.879
- How is he?
- I'm so sorry.

01:25:02.053 --> 01:25:03.888
Where's Spence?

01:25:03.921 --> 01:25:05.589
He took off about an hour ago.

01:25:14.899 --> 01:25:18.836
Five years and
not hello dad, how are ya?

01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:20.905
It was your dream, you always
wanted to be a snooker player.

01:25:20.938 --> 01:25:22.874
What do you
know about my dreams?

01:25:22.907 --> 01:25:24.741
You don't know me.

01:25:24.775 --> 01:25:27.611
Look, we all
make mistakes in life.

01:25:27.644 --> 01:25:28.813
I've made more than most.

01:25:28.846 --> 01:25:32.515
I do not
want to know you, Terry.

01:25:34.151 --> 01:25:35.820
How many have you had?

01:25:35.853 --> 01:25:36.686
None.

01:25:41.926 --> 01:25:42.860
Hello baby.

01:25:45.595 --> 01:25:46.764
You all right?

01:25:55.072 --> 01:25:58.742
I still remember the
day he went to court.

01:25:59.944 --> 01:26:01.879
He come round, he
was wearing a suit.

01:26:06.217 --> 01:26:09.120
Said he was going for a
job interview, didn't he?

01:26:11.956 --> 01:26:13.523
Asked him if it was a good job.

01:26:15.226 --> 01:26:17.762
- He said...
- Not particularly boy.

01:26:19.063 --> 01:26:22.066
I really hope I don't get it.

01:26:22.099 --> 01:26:23.000
I remember.

01:26:26.569 --> 01:26:28.605
He did get it
though, didn't he?

01:26:28.638 --> 01:26:29.472
Six years.

01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:35.846
Funny fucker wasn't he.

01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:36.914
He certainly could be.

01:26:44.889 --> 01:26:47.590
I wanted to know
him a bit longer, mum.

01:26:48.759 --> 01:26:51.494
I know baby, I
know, it's okay.

01:27:00.805 --> 01:27:01.906
I'm better.

01:27:07.111 --> 01:27:10.580
Qiang, I ain't going to
pay that safety play,

01:27:10.613 --> 01:27:11.215
it bores me.

01:27:13.017 --> 01:27:14.517
Play how you want, just win.

01:27:18.022 --> 01:27:21.591
Thank you, for
helping me with,

01:27:24.295 --> 01:27:25.528
I know you didn't want to.

01:27:26.696 --> 01:27:28.665
Whatever happens,
I'm glad I did.

01:27:30.768 --> 01:27:31.601
All right.

01:27:39.609 --> 01:27:41.745
- You all right, Shell?
- Yeah.

01:27:41.779 --> 01:27:44.215
You ain't got to worry about
me you know, I'm all right.

01:27:44.248 --> 01:27:46.984
I'm not worried, Spence.

01:27:47.018 --> 01:27:50.687
Look, I'm gonna go
get a couple hours kip,

01:27:52.622 --> 01:27:53.758
playing soon, innit so.

01:28:06.871 --> 01:28:08.305
Pryde, you break first.

01:28:09.273 --> 01:28:11.909
Settle down please,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:28:48.079 --> 01:28:48.913
One.

01:29:07.798 --> 01:29:08.631
45.

01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:14.604
Scores 51.

01:29:21.846 --> 01:29:24.882
Concede, concede.

01:29:25.883 --> 01:29:27.318
Spencer Pryde concedes.

01:29:28.419 --> 01:29:30.720
Leung leads one frame to nil.

01:29:47.171 --> 01:29:48.105
Spencer!

01:29:49.773 --> 01:29:51.375
Just give me a minute.

01:30:08.225 --> 01:30:10.194
Spencer, we should
call this off,

01:30:10.227 --> 01:30:11.128
you can't continue.

01:30:13.063 --> 01:30:14.265
I can and I am.

01:30:14.298 --> 01:30:18.169
Son, I'm sorry about
your dad, I truly am,

01:30:18.202 --> 01:30:20.271
all bets are off, okay.

01:30:20.304 --> 01:30:22.039
All bets are not off, Monty.

01:30:22.072 --> 01:30:23.706
But you're
in no fit state.

01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:26.076
What bets, Monty, what
are you talking about?

01:30:26.110 --> 01:30:28.279
With the greatest respect son,

01:30:28.312 --> 01:30:29.980
it ain't your decision to make.

01:30:35.319 --> 01:30:36.153
Bet stands.

01:30:39.356 --> 01:30:42.760
All right, but just to
make it perfectly clear,

01:30:42.793 --> 01:30:46.096
if he loses, I
will take the car.

01:30:50.801 --> 01:30:52.770
As long as you
pay up when he wins.

01:31:01.445 --> 01:31:02.346
Come on.

01:31:19.230 --> 01:31:21.265
You all right, Spencer?

01:31:24.868 --> 01:31:26.170
Good lad, go on.

01:32:26.497 --> 01:32:31.201
Yes!

01:35:24.541 --> 01:35:27.010
You just cost me 15 grand.

01:35:28.612 --> 01:35:29.446
But it was worth it.

01:35:30.547 --> 01:35:31.748
Well done son, well done.

01:35:33.250 --> 01:35:34.551
I suppose you want
the money in cash?

01:35:34.585 --> 01:35:38.489
I wouldn't mind
Monty, I wouldn't mind.

01:35:38.522 --> 01:35:40.324
Well played, Spencer.

01:35:40.357 --> 01:35:41.725
Cheers, nice one.

01:35:51.568 --> 01:35:53.670
A wise owl once told me
that I was unoriginal.

01:35:54.638 --> 01:35:56.540
He said that there was
one of me on the corner

01:35:56.573 --> 01:35:59.643
of every street, in every
city, all over the world.

01:36:00.812 --> 01:36:02.579
He told me to our
lives are just a series

01:36:02.613 --> 01:36:06.250
of incidents or events
and experiences.

01:36:06.283 --> 01:36:10.187
But the important thing is
not the events themselves

01:36:10.220 --> 01:36:11.488
but how we deal with them.

01:36:12.689 --> 01:36:14.591
Some of us react
in a positive way.

01:36:14.625 --> 01:36:17.494
It makes us stronger,
more determined.

01:36:18.629 --> 01:36:23.166
Some, some let their experiences
get the better of them.

01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:28.205
It consumes them, until
eventually it becomes them,

01:36:29.339 --> 01:36:32.209
and ultimately it destroys them.

01:36:33.610 --> 01:36:35.780
There've been numerous
events, incidents

01:36:35.813 --> 01:36:37.681
and experiences
in my life so far.

01:36:38.715 --> 01:36:41.251
Some I wish I could forget.

01:36:44.588 --> 01:36:47.391
And some I hope
I've learned from.

01:36:49.326 --> 01:36:50.862
You didn't let me down.

01:36:50.895 --> 01:36:51.728
Appreciate it.

01:36:52.729 --> 01:36:54.731
Well, you didn't give
me too much choice, Ray.

01:36:56.733 --> 01:36:58.669
Alena you have
something else for me?

01:37:03.674 --> 01:37:06.343
She said to just
give that to you.

01:37:07.311 --> 01:37:08.545
It's the name she wanted.

01:37:12.149 --> 01:37:12.784
Yeah.

01:37:17.387 --> 01:37:18.555
Let's walk, walk with me.

01:37:26.396 --> 01:37:28.365
Take this with
you, you earned it.

01:37:36.506 --> 01:37:37.574
Thanks, Ray.

01:37:39.376 --> 01:37:42.145
I don't need to
see here again.

01:37:47.751 --> 01:37:49.219
Now, get the fuck outta here.

01:39:09.767 --> 01:39:11.769
But there is one
event, one memory,

01:39:12.770 --> 01:39:15.505
I hope will stay with me
for the rest of my life.

01:39:18.742 --> 01:39:19.844
Do you want another one?

01:39:19.877 --> 01:39:21.578
No I don't you jammy bastard.

01:39:21.611 --> 01:39:22.814
What's that, three in a row?

01:39:23.848 --> 01:39:25.515
I can't believe it Tel,
