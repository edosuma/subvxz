00:02.800 --> 00:04.433
- FEMALE ANNOUNCER: Last time
on "Still The King"--

00:04.533 --> 00:06.100
- Will you finally admit
you're jealous of Ronnie?

00:06.200 --> 00:08.300
- I told you, baby, I just
ain't the jealous type.

00:08.400 --> 00:09.633
What are you talking about,
Courtney?

00:09.733 --> 00:11.200
I told you, man,
I wrote this song.

00:11.300 --> 00:12.567
It's real personal to me.

00:12.667 --> 00:14.700
- Trying to make you
the biggest star in the world.

00:14.800 --> 00:17.000
- What do you say we hit
the bar down the street?

00:17.100 --> 00:18.067
- We're actually 16--

00:18.167 --> 00:20.000
- Sixteen minutes
late to college stuff.

00:20.100 --> 00:21.133
- I'm sorry, Charlotte,

00:21.233 --> 00:22.800
I just--I don't think
tonight's our night.

00:22.900 --> 00:24.400
- Reggie, what are you
doing here?

00:24.500 --> 00:26.000
We agreed that we were
on a break.

00:26.100 --> 00:27.133
- God, I miss game night.

00:27.233 --> 00:28.600
- You hated game night!

00:28.700 --> 00:31.100
- That was back before
I needed to impress you.

00:34.133 --> 00:36.900
- [crowd cheering]

00:39.167 --> 00:41.433
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

00:41.533 --> 00:44.967
Hey, did you drink some of this?

00:45.067 --> 00:48.367
- Well, I didn't
want it to spill.

00:48.467 --> 00:49.767
- That's my little Debbie.

00:49.867 --> 00:51.000
[laughs]

00:51.100 --> 00:52.467
- Get in there, Laciter!

00:52.567 --> 00:54.933
- Debbie!

00:55.033 --> 00:56.300
That's Palmavere.

00:56.400 --> 00:57.767
Laciter's the winger.

00:57.867 --> 01:00.400
- Kick his ass, Palmavere!

01:00.500 --> 01:04.267
- [laughs]
That's my little Debbie.

01:04.367 --> 01:09.133
- [crowd cheering]

01:09.233 --> 01:11.733
- Now that is what
I call romantic.

01:11.833 --> 01:15.067
- I hope someone proposes to me
on the Kiss-Cam one day.

01:15.167 --> 01:16.667
- I'm sure they will, honey.

01:16.767 --> 01:19.833
I'm sure they will.

01:19.933 --> 01:22.933
- [crowd cheering]

01:23.067 --> 01:24.400
- *

01:24.500 --> 01:29.067
* Still the King *

01:29.167 --> 01:31.867
- *

01:33.733 --> 01:34.700
- Here you go.

01:34.800 --> 01:35.933
- Ooh!

01:36.067 --> 01:38.400
Bacon, ham, sausage.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.433
You hit all the meat all-stars.

01:40.533 --> 01:42.067
What'd I do to deserve this?

01:42.167 --> 01:44.133
- Please, do you know
how long it's been

01:44.233 --> 01:46.167
since I've been
to a hockey game?

01:46.267 --> 01:47.933
And right up on the glass.

01:48.067 --> 01:51.167
Vernon, I do not know what or
who you had to do to get these,

01:51.267 --> 01:52.400
but thank you.

01:52.500 --> 01:53.833
- Well, it's my pleasure.

01:53.933 --> 01:55.900
I just thought you and Charlotte
would really enjoy

01:56.067 --> 01:58.700
seeing me rock out with my band
in an arena like old times.

01:58.800 --> 02:00.367
- Except now
it's during intermissions

02:00.467 --> 02:02.367
while a hockey game
is the main draw.

02:02.467 --> 02:03.900
And you know what?
Charlotte is with Mabel

02:04.067 --> 02:06.467
making a homecoming float,
so I'm gonna bring Ronnie.

02:06.567 --> 02:07.967
I hope that's okay.

02:08.067 --> 02:09.767
- Yeah, sure.

02:09.867 --> 02:11.133
- Okay.

02:11.233 --> 02:13.633
- *

02:13.733 --> 02:15.800
- No problemo.

02:15.900 --> 02:17.733
- You are
a handsome and powerful man

02:17.833 --> 02:20.667
who's uniquely skilled in
the nautical and martial arts.

02:20.767 --> 02:24.067
And any woman would be lucky
to have you.

02:24.100 --> 02:25.767
[sighs]

02:28.267 --> 02:30.833
Deb...will you marry me?

02:30.933 --> 02:33.733
Uh! Ah!

02:33.833 --> 02:35.933
Come on,
you ever heard of knocking?

02:36.067 --> 02:37.167
- Is that an engagement ring?

02:37.267 --> 02:38.767
- Maybe, maybe not.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.767
You'll just have to find out
at the game later

02:40.867 --> 02:41.967
when I propose to Deb.

02:42.067 --> 02:43.867
- You're not using my ticket
to propose to her.

02:43.967 --> 02:44.900
- Not your ticket.

02:45.067 --> 02:47.067
My soon-to-be fiancÃ©e
gave it to me.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.167
'Cause tonight is
gonna be perfect.

02:50.267 --> 02:51.733
- We'll see about that.

02:51.833 --> 02:54.367
- *

02:57.133 --> 02:58.833
- Welcome to Tapits,

02:58.933 --> 03:01.633
a temperature conscious
dining experience.

03:01.733 --> 03:03.700
Here are your meat thermometers.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.300
Remember, if it's above 98,
we pay for your date.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.833
- Oh, I actually
don't need one.

03:07.933 --> 03:09.200
I don't eat meat.

03:09.300 --> 03:11.433
- Okay. [chuckles]

03:11.533 --> 03:14.300
- So you have to go home
after this?

03:14.400 --> 03:17.467
I was asking
for a friend of mine.

03:17.567 --> 03:19.700
- Well, you can tell
your friend that I was

03:19.800 --> 03:23.833
actually thinking of staying
at your place tonight.

03:23.933 --> 03:25.067
- Mm.

03:25.133 --> 03:27.100
- So, I have a few specials
to tell you about.

03:27.200 --> 03:31.633
Gazpacho, tuna tartar,
steak tartar, a cheese plate.

03:31.733 --> 03:35.833
And for dessert,
lukewarm lava cake.

03:35.933 --> 03:37.933
- Please tell me you brought me
here as a joke.

03:38.067 --> 03:39.600
- [laughing]

03:39.700 --> 03:42.667
- Food temperature-related
injuries are not a joke.

03:42.767 --> 03:45.067
- Sorry.

03:45.167 --> 03:46.567
- *

03:46.667 --> 03:48.800
- MALE ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:48.900 --> 03:52.533
seating in 15 minutes.

03:52.633 --> 03:55.633
- DEBBIE: [laughing]

03:55.733 --> 03:57.067
Come on,
let's find our seats.

03:57.100 --> 04:00.200
- Yeah, let's--hey, Vern.

04:00.300 --> 04:02.733
- Have a great show, bud.

04:02.833 --> 04:05.533
- Oh, Val, you can put
that over there, sir.

04:05.633 --> 04:07.867
- Oh, Mo, it's so heavy.

04:07.967 --> 04:09.800
- Well, it's made
with real cast iron.

04:09.900 --> 04:11.767
- Mm, it's a good thing
Val's so strong.

04:11.867 --> 04:13.867
- I would appreciate
not being objectified

04:13.967 --> 04:16.733
while I'm trying to work,
Carmen.

04:16.833 --> 04:17.900
- [laughs]

04:18.067 --> 04:19.067
Is this sexy or what?

04:19.167 --> 04:22.067
Now remember, this is
just an exposure gig.

04:22.133 --> 04:23.733
So play covers, no originals.

04:23.833 --> 04:25.433
- What do you mean no originals?

04:25.533 --> 04:28.300
- You can play some classic
Burnin' Vernon originals.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.833
But nothing after '92.

04:29.933 --> 04:31.467
Only songs
off your first record.

04:31.567 --> 04:33.633
- I was thinking my new
love song I wrote for Debbie

04:33.733 --> 04:34.867
might knock their socks off.

04:34.967 --> 04:36.500
- Oh, no, no, Vernon,
you don't want

04:36.600 --> 04:38.133
any of these people's socks
to be coming off.

04:38.233 --> 04:39.533
Trust me.

04:39.633 --> 04:41.367
Besides, you don't want
to debut that new song here.

04:41.467 --> 04:42.900
- When do you
recommend I debut it?

04:43.067 --> 04:45.200
- Oh, soon. Very soon.

04:45.300 --> 04:47.133
But these things
have to be finessed, man.

04:47.233 --> 04:49.567
- I think Vernon's trying to do
some finessing of his own.

04:49.667 --> 04:53.467
His baby mama's here,
and he wrote it for her.

04:53.567 --> 04:55.800
- Oh, that's beautiful, man.

04:55.900 --> 04:57.767
Now, remember, just play
the old [bleep], okay?

04:57.867 --> 04:59.133
Alright, okay.

04:59.233 --> 05:00.867
Good show.
Good show, everybody!

05:03.500 --> 05:05.900
- Nothing like the smell
of beer, sweat, and ice.

05:06.067 --> 05:08.233
It's gonna be a special night,
Ronnie, I can feel it.

05:08.333 --> 05:10.600
- Yeah, it is.
Oh, 118, that's us.

05:10.700 --> 05:12.333
How 'bout you go ahead
and get our seats,

05:12.433 --> 05:14.333
I'll get us some hotdogs,
some beer,

05:14.433 --> 05:16.100
and maybe
make a deposit at the pee bank.

05:16.200 --> 05:17.300
- Yeah, but not in that order.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.067
- Well, you know.

05:20.267 --> 05:23.133
- *

05:27.133 --> 05:29.067
- Hey.
- Ah!

05:29.100 --> 05:30.233
Oh.

05:30.333 --> 05:33.133
- Ronnie? How did you--what are
you doing here?

05:33.233 --> 05:34.667
- We thought you blew up.

05:34.767 --> 05:36.100
- Yeah, I get that a lot.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.200
What are you doing here?

05:37.300 --> 05:39.767
- Well, you know,
we...got real jobs now.

05:39.867 --> 05:40.567
- Oh.

05:40.667 --> 05:41.833
I see how it is.

05:41.933 --> 05:43.800
I get blown to bits,
you just abandon the arts.

05:43.900 --> 05:46.133
- It was cool working for free
in your girlfriend's basement,

05:46.233 --> 05:47.967
but they pay us here.

05:48.067 --> 05:51.067
And it's helped
my self-esteem, so--

05:51.100 --> 05:52.833
- Yeah, and my mom's
medical bills, which--

05:52.933 --> 05:53.933
- Ssh, sellouts.

05:54.067 --> 05:55.400
Listen, I'm gonna propose
to Debbie,

05:55.500 --> 05:57.867
and I need it to be
on the Jumbotron.

05:57.967 --> 06:00.100
You do this, I'll get you
back on the show.

06:00.200 --> 06:03.167
- *

06:13.200 --> 06:14.367
- Waaah.

06:14.467 --> 06:15.867
[laughs]

06:15.967 --> 06:18.867
- Hey, buddy, take it easy!

06:18.967 --> 06:20.533
- Walt, hey.

06:20.633 --> 06:22.333
- [laughing] What?

06:22.433 --> 06:24.200
Did you think I was a real dog?

06:24.300 --> 06:25.567
Idiot!

06:25.667 --> 06:27.533
- You're Daredevil Dachshund?

06:27.633 --> 06:29.467
- I can neither
confirm nor deny.

06:29.567 --> 06:30.800
- He won a sweepstakes.

06:30.900 --> 06:32.400
He gets to be the
special guest mascot.

06:32.500 --> 06:34.167
- Babe, come on.

06:34.267 --> 06:37.567
We mascots make a solemn vow to
protect our civilian identities.

06:37.667 --> 06:40.067
- But you just revealed
your identity to me.

06:40.133 --> 06:41.333
And to those people.

06:41.433 --> 06:42.700
- Daddy,
why is that man wearing

06:42.800 --> 06:45.167
Daredevil Dachshund's skin?

06:45.267 --> 06:46.900
- Ah, that's horrible.

06:47.067 --> 06:47.867
Come on.

06:47.967 --> 06:49.767
What are you even
doing here, Walt?

06:49.867 --> 06:52.067
- Well, we're the featured
house band tonight.

06:52.133 --> 06:53.267
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:53.367 --> 06:54.400
- That's awesome.

06:54.500 --> 06:55.733
- Oh, yeah.

06:55.833 --> 06:58.067
If you think playing in a band

06:58.133 --> 07:01.633
is more awesome than dressing up
like a sausage-shaped dog

07:01.733 --> 07:05.067
and swinging from ropes
at a sporting event.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.533
Yah!

07:06.633 --> 07:08.633
- Well, I guess if
you put it that way.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.067
- Whatever forever, Walt!

07:15.133 --> 07:16.167
- Double D.

07:16.267 --> 07:17.633
Come on, man, photo-op time.

07:17.733 --> 07:19.600
St. Agatha's Orphanage,
let's go.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.067
- Uh, they're such losers.

07:21.167 --> 07:23.900
No wonder their parents
don't want 'em.

07:24.067 --> 07:25.867
[in cartoon voice] Hi, kids.

07:25.967 --> 07:28.600
- Right. I gotta go set up.
- I wanna help.

07:28.700 --> 07:30.367
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:30.467 --> 07:31.867
- Okay, come on.

07:31.967 --> 07:35.067
- *

07:35.133 --> 07:38.900
- [crowd cheering]

07:39.067 --> 07:42.567
- *

07:42.667 --> 07:43.967
- Penalty!

07:44.067 --> 07:45.433
Oh, come on!

07:45.533 --> 07:47.133
Crosschecking!

07:47.233 --> 07:50.500
Grow some eyes, ref!

07:50.600 --> 07:53.600
- [crowd cheers]

07:53.700 --> 08:00.067
- [buzzer sounds]

08:00.100 --> 08:01.600
- Come on,
let's kick it, quick.

08:01.700 --> 08:04.633
- *

08:04.733 --> 08:08.400
* Bellbottoms were really cool

08:08.500 --> 08:10.233
- Oh, yeah!

08:10.333 --> 08:12.267
- You freaking kidding me?

08:12.367 --> 08:14.300
- Oh, look, hon,
Vernon's on the Jumbotron.

08:14.400 --> 08:15.467
Do you see him, honey?

08:15.567 --> 08:16.900
- Yeah, yeah, that's great.

08:17.067 --> 08:20.267
- * I want my money back *

08:23.733 --> 08:26.367
- * My old Camaro
and my 8-tracks *

08:26.467 --> 08:30.800
* Fuzzy dice hanging
loose and proud *

08:30.900 --> 08:36.067
* ZZ Top, they're playing loud

08:36.133 --> 08:38.533
- What the hell was that?
- Sorry, Mr. Ronnie.

08:38.633 --> 08:40.667
The only way to guarantee
to be on the Jumbotron

08:40.767 --> 08:44.467
is if you're a hockey player
or in the band or a mascot.

08:44.567 --> 08:47.133
- Or if you're famous, which,
let's be honest, I don't think

08:47.233 --> 08:49.133
enough people have actually
seen your show to recognize--

08:49.233 --> 08:50.267
- Sshh.

08:50.367 --> 08:54.467
Just get me
on the damn Jumbotron.

08:54.567 --> 09:00.200
- *

09:07.533 --> 09:11.400
- * Summertime,
that's what I miss *

09:11.500 --> 09:14.767
- [crowd cheering]

09:14.867 --> 09:17.067
- What's--what--

09:17.100 --> 09:19.867
- [crowd cheering]

09:19.967 --> 09:20.833
- Ronnie!

09:20.933 --> 09:23.067
- Here we go, babe.

09:23.167 --> 09:24.833
- I want a T-shirt!

09:24.933 --> 09:28.100
Over here!

09:28.200 --> 09:32.467
- [crowd cheering]

09:32.567 --> 09:37.467
- *

09:37.567 --> 09:40.267
- [indistinct whispering]

09:40.367 --> 09:44.400
- *

09:54.500 --> 09:56.200
- Debbie Lynn Cook--

09:56.300 --> 09:58.467
- Oh, Ronnie, look,
you got a T-shirt.

09:58.567 --> 10:00.900
Yah, that's so awesome!

10:01.000 --> 10:02.400
- Bull's eye.

10:02.500 --> 10:05.133
- *

10:17.600 --> 10:18.633
- BOTH: [laughing]

10:18.733 --> 10:20.100
- You don't take
advantage of me, Charlotte,

10:20.200 --> 10:21.133
because I've had a few drinks.

10:21.233 --> 10:23.933
- Oh, I'm counting on it.

10:24.033 --> 10:28.933
In fact, we should
probably take this off.

10:29.033 --> 10:30.433
That's better.

10:30.533 --> 10:31.867
- Oh yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

10:31.967 --> 10:35.133
- Are you gonna join me?
- Maybe, if I want to.

10:35.233 --> 10:36.600
- Mm.

10:36.700 --> 10:39.567
- [indistinct mumbling]

10:39.667 --> 10:41.000
- Oh, shoot, I'm sorry.

10:41.100 --> 10:43.267
Let me just--
- No.

10:43.367 --> 10:45.000
[laughs]

10:45.100 --> 10:48.433
- Oh, somebody's got
big plans tonight.

10:48.533 --> 10:49.600
- No.

10:49.700 --> 10:51.367
Don't flatter yourself.

10:51.467 --> 10:53.133
[giggles]

10:53.233 --> 10:54.667
- *

10:54.767 --> 10:56.600
- What?

10:59.400 --> 11:00.467
- Okay, so I--

11:00.567 --> 11:03.067
- Either...

11:03.100 --> 11:06.700
you've been lying to me
about your age.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.167
Or you're a time traveler
from the state of Montana.

11:09.267 --> 11:11.500
- *

11:14.367 --> 11:17.067
- * Hey good-looking

11:17.133 --> 11:18.833
- Please say something.

11:22.067 --> 11:23.733
- [clears throat]

11:26.567 --> 11:30.133
I'm assuming you're not
an uncover narc, hmm?

11:30.233 --> 11:32.967
Like "21 Jump Street"?

11:33.067 --> 11:36.333
- I don't know what that is.
- Exactly.

11:36.433 --> 11:37.533
You really are in high school.

11:37.633 --> 11:38.800
- Please--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:38.900 --> 11:40.800
- --talk about--

11:40.900 --> 11:42.067
- Who else knows about this?

11:42.100 --> 11:43.433
- Just Mabel, that's it.
I promise.

11:43.533 --> 11:46.400
- Mabel? Yeah, right.
What is she, 12?

11:46.500 --> 11:48.633
- Lloy, I'm--I'm really sorry.

11:48.733 --> 11:52.333
I just--I really like you,
and I got caught in this lie

11:52.433 --> 11:54.200
from the beginning.
And I just got scared that--

11:54.300 --> 11:55.867
- That I might be a little
upset?

11:55.967 --> 11:57.167
Yeah, it's kind of a big deal.

11:57.267 --> 12:00.200
And I'm pretty sure
it's illegal.

12:02.633 --> 12:04.600
- [dog barking]

12:04.700 --> 12:06.233
- [sighs]

12:06.333 --> 12:08.100
Yep, totally illegal.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.433
[sighs]

12:10.533 --> 12:12.700
- [sighs]

12:14.200 --> 12:17.133
Can't we just
like--I don't know.

12:17.233 --> 12:19.300
- Hey.

12:19.400 --> 12:24.300
I like you...a lot.

12:24.400 --> 12:27.533
But we can't do this.

12:27.633 --> 12:31.667
At least not for 18 months...

12:31.767 --> 12:34.333
3 hours, and 12 minutes.

12:36.767 --> 12:39.300
- [sighs]

12:40.733 --> 12:42.600
- MASCOT: What's your name,
little man?

12:42.700 --> 12:43.433
- BOY: JD.

12:43.533 --> 12:46.067
- JD, that's a cool name.

12:46.167 --> 12:47.867
- Hey, dog, listen up.

12:47.967 --> 12:51.433
It's my lady's big dream to be
proposed to on the Jumbotron.

12:51.533 --> 12:53.633
But I'm having a bad time
getting some screen time,

12:53.733 --> 12:56.433
if you know what I mean.

12:56.533 --> 12:58.467
Hello, I'm talking
about making a dealio.

12:58.567 --> 13:00.267
I take a stroll in your paws.

13:00.367 --> 13:02.067
The old collar swap.

13:02.167 --> 13:03.500
Hello?

13:03.600 --> 13:06.067
Damn it, look, man, I just need
to be Daredevil Dachshund

13:06.167 --> 13:07.733
for like 20 minutes, capiche?

13:07.833 --> 13:08.900
- You listen up.

13:09.067 --> 13:10.333
You listen up good.

13:10.433 --> 13:13.600
When I dawned the pelt
of Daredevil Dachshund,

13:13.700 --> 13:16.867
I took an implied silent oath
that I would protect

13:16.967 --> 13:19.933
the integrity of the character
and all he stood for.

13:20.067 --> 13:23.433
I will not tarnish the legacy
of all the mascots

13:23.533 --> 13:25.300
that have gone before me.

13:25.400 --> 13:29.433
- Maybe you haven't met
my old friend George Hamilton.

13:34.267 --> 13:37.800
- *

13:47.367 --> 13:49.533
- There you are.

13:49.633 --> 13:51.833
It's almost second intermission.

13:51.933 --> 13:52.800
Time for your stunt.

13:52.900 --> 13:53.833
- Stunt?

13:53.933 --> 13:55.567
I've been trying
to get on the Jumbotron.

13:55.667 --> 13:56.600
- What?

13:56.700 --> 13:58.267
- I'm trying to get
on the Jumbotron.

13:58.367 --> 14:00.333
- Let's just get you
strapped in.

14:08.067 --> 14:12.633
- *

14:24.767 --> 14:27.067
- Ahhh!

14:27.133 --> 14:30.333
- Okay, as soon as the announcer
finishes, you let 'em have it.

14:30.433 --> 14:33.233
You guys might even get out
like a whole half a song.

14:33.333 --> 14:34.933
- Really? It's amazing.

14:35.067 --> 14:36.567
- "Wouldn't Be Me" in G.

14:36.667 --> 14:40.067
- *

14:42.067 --> 14:45.733
- * If I never see
your smile again *

14:45.833 --> 14:48.133
*

14:48.233 --> 14:52.067
* Never touch your *

14:52.133 --> 14:54.300
- MALE ANNOUNCER: Alright, fans.
- Are you kidding me?

14:54.400 --> 14:56.533
- ANNOUNCER: Turn your eyes
to the sky.

14:56.633 --> 14:58.867
- This can't be happening now.

14:58.967 --> 15:03.833
- *

15:04.967 --> 15:06.667
- Okay, Max jumps first.

15:06.767 --> 15:09.700
When he lands, he unhooks,
and then you go, Double D.

15:09.800 --> 15:12.767
- *

15:16.500 --> 15:19.267
- It's go-time, Max.

15:19.367 --> 15:21.100
- Whoo!

15:21.200 --> 15:25.633
- *

15:25.733 --> 15:27.167
- Alright, Double D,
you all strapped in?

15:27.267 --> 15:28.833
- I'm not the real guy!

15:28.933 --> 15:30.100
I'm Ronnie!

15:30.200 --> 15:31.233
- What was that?

15:31.333 --> 15:33.667
- I'm not the real guy,
I'm Ronnie!

15:33.767 --> 15:35.200
- I can't understand
you, buddy.

15:35.300 --> 15:36.233
You know what?

15:36.333 --> 15:38.433
Just tell me later.

15:38.533 --> 15:41.100
- ANNOUNCER:
Daredevil Dachshund.

15:41.200 --> 15:45.100

15:45.200 --> 15:47.600

15:50.300 --> 15:51.633
- Uh!

15:51.733 --> 15:53.733
- ANNOUNCER: Just
a slight malfunction.

15:53.833 --> 15:55.567
Hang on, folks.

15:55.667 --> 15:57.600

15:57.700 --> 15:59.133
- Ah!

15:59.233 --> 16:00.667
- Ronnie?

16:00.767 --> 16:02.133
- Ronnie!

16:05.433 --> 16:07.200
- Ronnie.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.433
- Sam?

16:08.533 --> 16:09.400
- Ronnie, look.

16:09.500 --> 16:11.067
Baby, are you alright?

16:11.100 --> 16:12.233
- I'm a little dizzy.

16:12.333 --> 16:13.633
I could use some candy.
- Sssh.

16:13.733 --> 16:15.800
- Grandma, do I
have amnesia again?

16:15.900 --> 16:17.967
- ANNOUNCER: And he's okay!

16:18.067 --> 16:21.700
- [crowd cheering]

16:21.800 --> 16:25.233
- Ronnie, look, do you see us?
We're on the Jumbrotron?

16:25.333 --> 16:27.533
- We are.
- Yeah.

16:30.267 --> 16:31.900
Debbie Lynn Cook--

16:32.067 --> 16:35.067
- Ronnie.

16:35.133 --> 16:38.467
- Except for that one moment
on a boat we won't go into now,

16:38.567 --> 16:41.133
you've been by my side
through thick and thin,

16:41.233 --> 16:43.133
high tide and low,

16:43.233 --> 16:45.433
alive and presumed dead.

16:45.533 --> 16:48.200
I know sometimes
I work out too much.

16:48.300 --> 16:49.333
- [laughs]

16:49.433 --> 16:50.833
- I get distracted
by my karate goals.

16:50.933 --> 16:51.967
- You do.

16:52.067 --> 16:54.667
- But I'd be honored
to be your first mate

16:54.767 --> 16:56.333
on this love boat called life.

16:56.433 --> 16:58.633
- *

16:58.733 --> 17:00.267
- Will you marry me?

17:00.367 --> 17:06.067
- *

17:06.167 --> 17:07.633
- Yes.

17:07.733 --> 17:09.533
Yes, Ronnie, I'll marry you.

17:09.633 --> 17:10.800
- [buzzer sounds]

17:10.900 --> 17:12.733
- ANNOUNCER: She said yes.

17:12.833 --> 17:16.067
- [crowd cheering]

17:17.933 --> 17:21.600
- Love is a smoke which is
made from the fumes of signs.

17:21.700 --> 17:26.067
- [cheering continues]

17:26.133 --> 17:30.067
- *

17:37.567 --> 17:42.933
- [cheering continues]

17:49.667 --> 17:50.467
- You okay, Vern?

17:50.567 --> 17:51.667
- Ha!

17:51.767 --> 17:54.100
I never had a jealous bone
in my damn body.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.633
- Never mentioned anything
about being jealous.

17:55.733 --> 17:58.100
- Well, I'm gonna go
make some poor decisions.

18:00.833 --> 18:02.167
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:02.267 --> 18:03.233
- I'm sorry about Reggie.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.833
He's acting like a jerk.

18:04.933 --> 18:06.400
- You don't have
to apologize for him.

18:06.500 --> 18:07.867
He is sorry enough on his own.

18:07.967 --> 18:10.700
- Well, speaking of, I can't
find him anywhere,

18:10.800 --> 18:12.500
and he was my ride home.

18:12.600 --> 18:14.667
- I can give you a ride.

18:14.767 --> 18:16.100
- Are you sure you don't mind?

18:16.200 --> 18:17.367
- No.
- You do?

18:17.467 --> 18:20.067
- No, I mean, that--that
I'm sure that I don't mind.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.700
No, I'd like to give you
a ride.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.300
- You would?
- Yeah.

18:23.400 --> 18:25.867
- Okay.
- Come on, let's go.

18:25.967 --> 18:27.900
[laughs]

18:29.267 --> 18:30.967
- [gasps]

18:31.067 --> 18:32.367
Don't do that.

18:32.467 --> 18:33.467
I thought you were a spider.

18:33.567 --> 18:35.200
- Okay, well, I'm not a spider.

18:35.300 --> 18:37.700
I was wondering if you wanted
to go grab a drink with me?

18:37.800 --> 18:39.633
- Why?
So you can scare me again?

18:39.733 --> 18:41.267
Thanks, but no thanks.

18:41.367 --> 18:44.300
- Okay, well, let me know
if you change your mind.

18:44.400 --> 18:47.367
- It's like dying of thirst
while watching a man pour out

18:47.467 --> 18:49.800
the last glass
of water on Earth.

18:58.333 --> 19:00.067
- [engine shuts off]

19:05.933 --> 19:09.433
- Maybe we can
try and be friends?

19:09.533 --> 19:10.933
- Yeah.

19:11.067 --> 19:14.567
Uh, I could wait for you
to get out of school

19:14.667 --> 19:16.133
near the parking lot.

19:16.233 --> 19:17.167
- Stop.

19:17.267 --> 19:18.800
- It wouldn't be
creepy at all, trust me.

19:18.900 --> 19:20.367
- Okay, I'm being serious.

19:20.467 --> 19:22.833
- We can be friends.

19:22.933 --> 19:27.733
But only for 18 months,

19:27.833 --> 19:30.900
2 hours, and 33 minutes.

19:31.067 --> 19:32.533
Then all bets are off.

19:32.633 --> 19:34.300
- Okay, deal.

19:34.400 --> 19:35.900
- Deal.

19:36.067 --> 19:39.300
- *

19:42.067 --> 19:44.733
- Thirty-two minutes.

19:44.833 --> 19:47.067
- Bye, Lloy Danderson.

19:47.100 --> 19:50.800
- *

19:53.533 --> 19:55.400
- Hey, honey.

19:58.067 --> 20:00.200
You okay?

20:00.300 --> 20:03.967
- Uh, I'm not sure.

20:04.067 --> 20:05.567
You okay?

20:05.667 --> 20:08.233
- I'm not sure either.

20:08.333 --> 20:10.900
I got a feeling we're both sad
about the same thing though.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.967
- [laughing] God I hope not.

20:15.067 --> 20:17.933
- Are you upset because Ronnie
proposed to your mama tonight?

20:18.033 --> 20:19.367
- What?

20:19.467 --> 20:20.633
He did?

20:20.733 --> 20:21.800
- Yeah.

20:21.900 --> 20:24.933
On the Jumbotron.

20:25.033 --> 20:27.600
- Wow.

20:27.700 --> 20:30.433
- So...what are you sad about?

20:34.767 --> 20:36.933
- [chuckles]

20:37.033 --> 20:40.867
You ever get caught pretending
to be someone you're not?

20:40.967 --> 20:43.300
- Uh-huh, fake preacher.

20:43.400 --> 20:46.767
- [laughing]

20:46.867 --> 20:49.000
[sighs] College student.

20:49.100 --> 20:51.500
- Let me guess. Older boy?

20:51.600 --> 20:53.767
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

20:54.733 --> 20:56.400
Lloy Danderson.

20:56.500 --> 20:57.433
- Lloyd?

20:57.533 --> 21:00.367
- No, no, Lloy Danderson.

21:00.467 --> 21:02.400
It's stupid.

21:02.500 --> 21:03.600
- It's a messed up name.

21:03.700 --> 21:06.933
- [laughing]

21:07.067 --> 21:11.367
- *

21:11.467 --> 21:17.800
- So...does this mean you still
have feelings for mom?

21:17.900 --> 21:20.167
- Can you keep a secret?

21:20.267 --> 21:22.433
- You're talking to a girl
who's been living a double life

21:22.533 --> 21:24.067
the past couple of months.

21:24.100 --> 21:29.567
- Yeah, well,
then...yeah, I guess so.

21:29.667 --> 21:32.533
