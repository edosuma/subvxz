WEBVTT

00:11.094 --> 00:13.180
She just handed this to you?
The mystery girl?

00:13.180 --> 00:15.891
She didn't say anything?
-No.

00:16.642 --> 00:18.977
Well, I mean, it must mean something.

00:18.977 --> 00:22.147
She wanted you to have it.
It's, like, meaningful.

00:23.774 --> 00:25.442
Maybe it was just random.

00:26.860 --> 00:32.573
Like, maybe she just had it in her pocket
and decided to, you know, give it to me.

00:32.573 --> 00:34.952
Yeah, and maybe the world is flat,
and maybe there's no God,

00:34.952 --> 00:36.954
and maybe Taylor Swift is, like, mortal.

00:43.752 --> 00:44.837
What's that?

00:48.131 --> 00:49.550
That's everything.

00:50.717 --> 00:51.760
All of our stuff.

00:53.554 --> 00:54.555
Can you play piano?

01:13.699 --> 01:16.577
No. Not really.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.417
I have to go hydrate.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.348
Staff announcement...

02:23.018 --> 02:26.647
Final boarding call
for flight 818 to Los Angeles.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.857
Final boarding call for flight 818.

02:28.857 --> 02:30.108
Shit!

02:46.875 --> 02:48.293
Hi. Sorry.
-Hi. Welcome aboard.

02:48.293 --> 02:49.378
Sorry.

02:52.381 --> 02:55.592
Hi. What a coincidence.
-Hi. How are you? Yes.

02:55.592 --> 02:58.136
What are you doing here? This is amazing.

02:58.136 --> 03:00.430
Yeah, had a bit of a luggage malfunction,

03:00.430 --> 03:02.391
but found a maintenance person...
-I hate that. Yeah.

03:02.391 --> 03:04.852
...so duct tape. That's what that is.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.436
I hope--

03:07.020 --> 03:08.647
I should get back to economy...
-Yeah.

03:08.647 --> 03:11.024
...but have a good flight.
-Have a good flight, Lacey.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.402
It's Linda.

03:13.402 --> 03:15.946
Linda! Oh, my God.
-Lacey's the aunt. Yeah.

03:15.946 --> 03:17.281
It's okay.
-Right.

03:17.281 --> 03:20.117
No worries. That's-- Have a good one.
-Okay. You too.

03:20.117 --> 03:21.618
Sorry.
-It's okay.

03:22.286 --> 03:24.037
You have to have power. Power. Command.

03:24.037 --> 03:27.624
Hi. Hi, I'm Adriana Washington,
and I'm running for Congress.

03:27.624 --> 03:28.959
No, you're gonna scare them.

03:28.959 --> 03:30.627
I'm Adriana Washington.

03:30.627 --> 03:35.549
You might know me because I was
Rose Washington's granddaughter, and...

03:36.592 --> 03:37.759
nepotism is cool.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.136
Fuck. Okay, hi.

03:41.638 --> 03:42.639
Okay.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.186
Hi. Hello. Hi.

03:47.186 --> 03:50.397
Hi. I'm Adriana Washington,
and I'm running for Congress.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.565
You sound like somebody died.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.066
Well, somebody did die.

03:55.444 --> 03:56.653
Hi. I'm--

04:01.074 --> 04:02.242
God.

04:10.459 --> 04:13.253
What is happening? Oh, my God.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.263
What the fuck?

04:29.561 --> 04:33.023
The landlady was a bit rude,
but that's okay.

04:33.565 --> 04:34.942
We learn from that.

04:36.610 --> 04:40.197
To stay longer, we would need a lawyer,
which is a waste of money,

04:40.197 --> 04:42.699
since we're going to Ghana
as soon as your passport arrives.

04:43.992 --> 04:46.453
But this is a much better plan.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.290
My cousin's best friend, Isaac,
has an apartment for us.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.668
We can stay there as long as we want

04:52.668 --> 04:54.837
and eat all the Ghanaian food we want.

04:54.837 --> 04:57.631
He has 300 five-star reviews. Sounds good?

05:02.636 --> 05:03.637
Okay.

05:07.349 --> 05:08.350
Let's go.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.102
Okay. Okay.

05:21.864 --> 05:24.157
When was the last time
you were at the shop?

05:25.033 --> 05:26.869
I don't know. I was little.

05:27.911 --> 05:32.875
I'm guessing seven, eight?

05:34.293 --> 05:35.669
I guess.

05:38.172 --> 05:39.756
Why do I have to go with you?

05:40.382 --> 05:42.134
Because you're not ready
to go to school yet.

05:45.804 --> 05:47.389
What do you mean, "Go to school"?

05:47.389 --> 05:49.308
Well, we can't homeschool you. We work.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.396
It'll be fine.
You'll be in class with Shay.

06:29.473 --> 06:32.851
You know, your mom and I would come here
almost every day after school.

06:35.854 --> 06:37.147
Why do you work here?

06:37.147 --> 06:41.485
Well, it's the family business.

06:50.869 --> 06:52.371
My mom didn't work here.

06:52.371 --> 06:55.290
She was a brilliant writer.

06:55.290 --> 06:57.584
She did not need to fabricate metal.

06:58.669 --> 07:00.337
She was gonna win a Pulitzer.

07:04.049 --> 07:07.010
Good to have you back.
-Wendell.

07:07.010 --> 07:10.931
You remember my nephew, Edward?
-Yep.

07:11.557 --> 07:12.891
That's a shit deal, Eddie.

07:12.891 --> 07:14.351
I sure am sorry.

07:14.351 --> 07:16.270
He prefers "Edward."

07:16.270 --> 07:17.354
No, it's okay.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.440
Okay.
-You ever run a high-capacity lathe?

07:20.440 --> 07:22.067
Seriously?

07:22.067 --> 07:24.278
Are you crazy? He can't work the machines.

07:24.278 --> 07:25.529
Why not?

07:26.530 --> 07:27.614
He's 12.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.700
I taught you the ropes
when you were eight.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.168
When you're older.

07:39.710 --> 07:43.005
Fine. I'll just sit here and do nothing.

07:58.979 --> 08:03.317
Linda. Hi.
-God. Hi.

08:05.194 --> 08:06.862
It was a rough flight, huh?

08:06.862 --> 08:08.447
I threw up.

08:08.447 --> 08:09.907
Oh, no.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.159
What are you doing in LA?

08:15.495 --> 08:19.124
I'm actually here
to see Gary's parents, who I've never met.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.209
And as I said,

08:20.209 --> 08:22.336
I don't think they actually know about me
or the baby,

08:22.336 --> 08:24.129
but I feel like they deserve to know.

08:24.129 --> 08:27.007
And I didn't wanna tell them on Zoom, so...

08:27.007 --> 08:28.342
How about you?

08:30.260 --> 08:33.054
My husband had business out here,
so I'm just-- You know,

08:33.054 --> 08:35.390
I have to tie up a few loose ends.

08:35.390 --> 08:37.183
Well, if you wanna get a coffee
or something while--

08:37.183 --> 08:39.227
Like, while we're both in town.
-That would be lovely.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.354
I would love that. Yeah.
-Yeah.

08:40.354 --> 08:43.565
I think my schedule is really tight,

08:43.565 --> 08:48.904
but good luck with Gary's parents,
and take care of the baby.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.823
Yeah.
-I'll see you later, okay?

08:52.950 --> 08:54.535
Take care, Linda.
-Bye.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.214
I wasn't planning on going to the wedding.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.340
It was a distant cousin,

09:08.340 --> 09:10.384
and my parents were going,
and we're not really speaking.

09:10.384 --> 09:14.638
But I went,
and I met this charming marine biologist

09:14.638 --> 09:18.350
who just talked for hours
and hours about whales.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.272
We just-- We fell in love.

09:28.443 --> 09:31.947
We have no reason
to doubt what you're saying,

09:31.947 --> 09:35.075
but Gary was--

09:36.743 --> 09:38.370
We were a very close family.

09:39.788 --> 09:43.458
Gary told us everything.
He never mentioned you.

09:45.544 --> 09:46.545
Okay.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.090
Okay.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.135
Look, I know how this might seem.

09:54.553 --> 09:58.056
We're-- I'm not--
I'm not looking for anything from you.

09:58.682 --> 10:02.603
I'm not asking for anything.
I'm-- Promise I just--

10:02.603 --> 10:07.316
I came here to tell you--
I flew here to tell you--

10:07.316 --> 10:09.276
I wanted to tell you face-to-face...

10:12.779 --> 10:15.407
that I'm pregnant.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.161
And I'm having the baby.

10:20.078 --> 10:21.955
But I'm not asking for anything.
I promise.

10:21.955 --> 10:26.168
You c-- Please, believe me.
I don't need anything.

10:27.336 --> 10:30.964
You're pregnant. You mean, with--

10:31.798 --> 10:33.759
With Gary's baby. Yeah.

10:37.262 --> 10:41.683
If you're lying to us, that would be
the cruelest thing a person could do.

10:43.143 --> 10:47.856
Oh, my God. I'm not lying.

10:49.608 --> 10:50.901
Oh, my God.

11:00.869 --> 11:02.037
Here we are.

11:05.165 --> 11:08.544
Thank you. Okay.

11:09.127 --> 11:11.171
Shut the front door.

11:13.257 --> 11:14.758
Don't judge a book by its cover.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.427
This place is a wow.

11:17.427 --> 11:19.513
And look at the furnishings.

11:19.513 --> 11:21.306
It's like it's already been staged.

11:21.306 --> 11:27.229
Lose the rug and add a few accessories,
then we can sell this place.

11:42.619 --> 11:45.914
And this r-- Was your husband a musician?

11:47.082 --> 11:48.208
He was not.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.285
I love the bedding.

12:23.911 --> 12:25.287
Is that from Parachute?

12:28.165 --> 12:29.750
I don't have any idea.

12:32.294 --> 12:33.545
It's a perfect match.

12:35.380 --> 12:36.507
I guess.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.467
You guess?

12:39.301 --> 12:40.344
You guess.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.972
Okay, fine. It looks like a match.

12:44.973 --> 12:46.058
A perfect match.

12:46.058 --> 12:48.560
The Museum of the Odd
and Peculiar in Manhattan.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.521
MOP. Mop. Get it?

12:50.521 --> 12:52.981
It's where this puppy comes from.
That's, like, its origin.

12:53.774 --> 12:56.735
Yeah, you said that. A lot of times.

12:57.819 --> 12:59.363
Hey,
I Sherlock Holmes'd the shit out of this,

12:59.363 --> 13:01.240
and you're seriously
not the least bit impressed?

13:01.240 --> 13:04.493
I think you're, like, obsessed.

13:04.493 --> 13:07.412
Which is a normal response
to what happened.

13:08.038 --> 13:11.416
Mystery Girl found you in ShopRite,
and handed this to you purposefully.

13:11.416 --> 13:13.293
She wants you to go there. It's a clue.

13:15.420 --> 13:16.421
Uh-huh.

13:17.256 --> 13:18.507
Listen to me.

13:18.507 --> 13:21.176
I've lived my whole life,
and not once has anyone

13:21.176 --> 13:24.137
ever handed me a shrunken head
or anything remotely close to that.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.306
Never. Not once. Nada.

13:26.974 --> 13:30.018
We are in Nyack.
Nothing cool like this ever happens.

13:30.018 --> 13:31.603
We cannot just let this go.

13:32.729 --> 13:35.816
So, what do you wanna do? Hunt her down?

13:37.985 --> 13:38.986
Text Lacey.

13:38.986 --> 13:41.905
Tell her you and I are going
to a friend's house to play video games

13:41.905 --> 13:43.365
for the rest of the day.

13:43.991 --> 13:44.992
We are?

13:45.993 --> 13:48.829
No. I don't have friends,
and I don't play video games.

13:48.829 --> 13:51.874
We're going to this freak museum
where we're gonna find Mystery Girl.

13:51.874 --> 13:54.209
Oh, no. No, we're not. Definitely not.

13:54.209 --> 13:55.669
Be honest, Edward.

13:56.253 --> 13:58.255
Don't you wanna know
who the mystery girl is?

14:01.967 --> 14:03.468
So let's have an adventure.

15:03.779 --> 15:06.657
Good. That's not bad. I like it.
I like that.

15:06.657 --> 15:09.660
All right. You are doing good.
Good colors.

15:10.452 --> 15:11.745
What's that?

15:11.745 --> 15:14.039
It's a wing. Duh.

15:16.834 --> 15:19.253
And now, orange.

15:19.253 --> 15:21.129
Hold on.
-I don't know what to do.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.591
Well look who it is.

15:25.175 --> 15:26.426
You're still not in Ghana?

15:27.010 --> 15:29.179
No. We are waiting for Becks's passport.

15:29.179 --> 15:30.347
Six to eight weeks.

15:31.348 --> 15:32.724
Oh, my God. That's great.

15:34.142 --> 15:36.520
I mean, that's not great.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.146
I'm sure you're anxious to get home.

15:39.314 --> 15:40.399
You coming to group?

15:41.024 --> 15:42.234
I'm deciding.

15:42.901 --> 15:44.403
And this is a difficult decision?

15:44.403 --> 15:48.615
It is. I have to get 1,300 signatures
by the end of the week, and I have 42.

15:49.199 --> 15:50.534
Signatures for what?

15:50.534 --> 15:51.660
To get on the ballot.

15:51.660 --> 15:53.829
For Congress. You are running!

15:54.496 --> 15:55.706
I don't know.

15:55.706 --> 15:58.166
But I can't get on the ballot
if I don't get signatures,

15:58.166 --> 16:00.878
so I probably shouldn't go to group.
And, you know, people are horrible.

16:00.878 --> 16:02.504
They are horrible. They come up to you

16:02.504 --> 16:05.299
and they say horrible things
to your face and then they don't sign.

16:05.299 --> 16:06.633
And my grandmother had this, like,

16:06.633 --> 16:09.219
wall of steel around her
that I don't have.

16:09.219 --> 16:11.847
I feel everything. Which is why
I'm probably not cut out for Congress.

16:11.847 --> 16:13.182
Plus, I haven't been getting any sleep,

16:13.182 --> 16:15.142
because my toilet's been making
this otherworldly sound.

16:15.142 --> 16:16.226
It's been freaking me out.

16:16.226 --> 16:19.271
Okay. Adriana. That's a lot.
-Yeah.

16:19.271 --> 16:22.357
Let's take it one item at a time. Okay?
-Okay.

16:23.358 --> 16:25.527
Start with the toilet.
Which sound is it making?

16:25.527 --> 16:28.780
I don't know.
Something between a clug and a jug.

16:29.281 --> 16:31.325
Interesting. Say it.

16:32.117 --> 16:33.577
Say it?
-Yes. Please.

16:33.577 --> 16:34.661
Well, I don't--

16:34.661 --> 16:36.121
What do you want me to--
-Say the sound.

16:38.165 --> 16:39.166
It's like a--

16:43.962 --> 16:44.963
Speak up.

16:51.220 --> 16:52.221
Interesting.

16:52.221 --> 16:54.014
I know that sound very well.
-Yeah.

16:54.014 --> 16:57.518
This I can fix. Okay. So, game plan.
-Okay. All right.

16:58.352 --> 17:00.646
We go to group to fix our souls.

17:00.646 --> 17:04.525
Then we go fix your toilet.
Then we get your signatures.

17:05.150 --> 17:07.236
Then you become the Congresswoman...
-Oh, my gosh.

17:07.236 --> 17:08.862
...and I cheer you on from Ghana.

17:10.030 --> 17:11.573
Sounds good?
-Yeah.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.367
Okay. We are running late. Let's go.
-Sounds good.

17:13.367 --> 17:14.742
Okay.
-Becks.

17:15.327 --> 17:16.744
Come get your turtle.

17:20.958 --> 17:22.501
Hello, Mr. Turtle.

17:22.501 --> 17:24.336
How are you? Hi, Becks.

17:25.420 --> 17:26.421
Do you need help?

18:09.423 --> 18:11.008
"Your lonely pilgrim."

19:31.338 --> 19:33.215
Just leave the groceries on the door!

19:34.132 --> 19:35.300
Noelle?

19:36.426 --> 19:39.471
Yeah. Sorry. If you could just--
just leave the groceries--

19:39.471 --> 19:41.014
Noelle? Greene?

19:41.014 --> 19:42.641
Yes. Can I help you?

19:42.641 --> 19:44.184
Yes. Yes, you can.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.144
You can tell me why
you were fucking my husband.

19:46.144 --> 19:48.146
Excuse me?
-Charles?

19:48.146 --> 19:53.026
I'm so sorry, ma'am, I have no idea--
-Charles Christopher Cameron?

19:53.026 --> 19:54.486
Charles Cameron?

19:55.988 --> 19:57.406
Charlie.

19:58.156 --> 19:59.867
You must be Deirdre.

19:59.867 --> 20:02.786
It's Dee Dee. And his name is Charles.
Not Charlie.

20:03.412 --> 20:06.790
Was.
-I am so sorry for your loss.

20:06.790 --> 20:10.169
Don't give me your fucking sympathy.

20:10.169 --> 20:11.420
Everything all right?

20:11.420 --> 20:13.380
Jesus Christ.
-What did you just say to my wife?

20:13.380 --> 20:14.590
Your wife?

20:14.590 --> 20:16.633
This is Charlie's wife.

20:19.178 --> 20:20.971
I'm so sorry for your loss.

20:20.971 --> 20:25.225
I only met Charlie a few times,
but he was so great.

20:25.976 --> 20:27.519
Well, I'm just so glad you li--

20:27.519 --> 20:29.229
What the fuck was going on here?

20:29.229 --> 20:31.064
Excuse me. Sorry, baby.
-It's okay.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.399
Why don't you take Skye in?

20:32.399 --> 20:33.650
It's okay, it's okay.

20:35.068 --> 20:36.069
Why don't you come inside...

20:36.069 --> 20:38.322
No, thank you. No, thank you.

20:39.406 --> 20:40.407
Never touch it.

20:40.407 --> 20:41.909
How did you know my husband?

20:41.909 --> 20:46.872
I run an LGBTQ youth center
in North Hollywood.

20:47.456 --> 20:51.293
Your husband was one
of our most cherished volunteers.

20:51.293 --> 20:53.295
No. Charles was a Republican.

20:53.295 --> 20:56.507
I mean, I had to tell him a thousand times
not to refer to them as, "the gays."

20:56.507 --> 20:59.426
Like, that doesn't make any sense.
I mean, how?

21:00.677 --> 21:03.263
He did such wonderful work.

21:03.263 --> 21:05.390
He was a wonderful man.

21:06.183 --> 21:07.976
Well, he abandoned his family.

21:09.770 --> 21:12.356
And he lied to us and he destroyed us,

21:12.356 --> 21:16.151
so he wasn't a wonderful man, Noelle.

21:16.151 --> 21:18.487
I knew he had to travel a lot.

21:19.738 --> 21:21.823
Is that it? He traveled to see me?

21:22.574 --> 21:25.827
This was home?
So he traveled to see his wife?

21:25.827 --> 21:27.955
Is that how that motherfucker put it?

21:27.955 --> 21:30.582
I don't know what to say.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.961
I am so sorry, Deirdre.

21:33.961 --> 21:37.297
You look upset. Look,
please come inside, have a kombucha.

21:37.297 --> 21:40.634
With all due respect, just
fucking shove your kombucha up your ass.

21:50.644 --> 21:52.062
What are you looking at?

22:07.119 --> 22:09.746
God, this is, like, the coolest place
on the entire planet.

22:09.746 --> 22:12.666
Did you know about this place?
-I never heard of it.

22:13.208 --> 22:15.043
You should wear that to school.

22:15.043 --> 22:16.170
I wish.

22:16.170 --> 22:17.921
I'm always trying to get, like,
cooler clothes,

22:17.921 --> 22:19.423
but I'm, like, stuck in this box.

22:19.423 --> 22:20.883
Box?

22:20.883 --> 22:24.303
You know, I'm, like,
the unexpectedly-athletic,

22:24.303 --> 22:26.054
smart, nerdy nerd with an edge.

22:26.054 --> 22:28.265
Been this way since third grade.
I can't shake it.

22:28.265 --> 22:30.225
Seems like a pretty specific box.

22:30.225 --> 22:31.560
A box is a box.

22:34.271 --> 22:35.814
Watch out,
I'm coming for you in your sleep.

22:42.654 --> 22:43.739
Come on.

23:37.084 --> 23:38.293
I don't recognize her.

23:39.253 --> 23:40.879
Are you sure you've never seen her?

23:42.714 --> 23:43.715
It's important.

23:45.384 --> 23:46.385
Sorry.

23:49.429 --> 23:50.806
Can I give you my number?

23:51.598 --> 23:53.725
Call if you see her, okay? I'm serious.

23:56.895 --> 23:58.105
Okay.

24:01.859 --> 24:03.610
Hey, where are the shrunken heads?

24:04.528 --> 24:05.487
Okay.

24:12.703 --> 24:15.873
So how'd you get into Roller Derby?
It seems pretty random.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.670
My dad used to take me ice-skating
when I was little and I really took to it.

24:21.670 --> 24:24.590
In life, I was, like, always
super awkward and bumping into stuff,

24:24.590 --> 24:26.383
but on skates, I just felt normal.

24:27.176 --> 24:30.262
Yeah, I went skating in Central Park
a few times when I was little.

24:30.971 --> 24:32.181
Didn't work out for me.

24:33.849 --> 24:35.475
There was quite a bit of blood.

24:39.188 --> 24:40.272
Jackpot!

24:42.065 --> 24:45.485
So, your dad... What happened to your dad?

24:46.069 --> 24:47.321
Nothing happened to him.

24:49.865 --> 24:51.533
Is it because...
-Because what?

24:53.660 --> 24:56.163
I mean,
he doesn't live with you guys, right?

24:56.914 --> 24:59.333
Okay. Listen, Edward.

24:59.833 --> 25:02.127
My dad's not some dick
who abandoned me. Okay?

25:02.127 --> 25:06.089
He's actually a really cool guy.
I mean, you've met my mom.

25:06.089 --> 25:09.218
She's hard to take.
There's, like, a limit.

25:09.218 --> 25:11.678
He just doesn't live with us.
That's all there is to it.

25:11.678 --> 25:15.349
Period. End of story.
The subject's off-limits, okay?

25:16.308 --> 25:18.143
Okay. I just--

25:18.143 --> 25:19.811
I just said!
-Okay.

25:23.482 --> 25:26.068
Maybe you're right.
Maybe it doesn't mean anything.

25:33.283 --> 25:35.035
Where are you going?
-I'm hungry.

25:36.495 --> 25:37.496
You can't eat there.

25:38.121 --> 25:40.874
Why not?
-That place isn't good. It's for tourists.

25:40.874 --> 25:43.001
Perfect. Guess what? I'm a tourist.

25:44.002 --> 25:45.462
I can't let you eat this food.

25:47.047 --> 25:49.091
You can't let me?
-No.

25:49.675 --> 25:51.301
So you know someplace better?

25:52.344 --> 25:55.097
I know the best place. Come on.

25:57.307 --> 25:58.559
Lead the way, weirdo.

25:59.434 --> 26:02.229
You like falafel?
-What's a falafel?

26:06.817 --> 26:10.654
Okay. Buddy, it's just you and me.

26:11.738 --> 26:12.739
Okay.

26:14.449 --> 26:15.450
Okay.

26:19.371 --> 26:21.832
I've been wanting
to get a hold of these braids.

26:23.250 --> 26:25.544
I like when you do my hair.
-Yeah?

26:26.128 --> 26:28.463
It doesn't hurt as much as
when my mommy did it.

26:30.048 --> 26:32.134
I remember when
my grandma used to do my hair,

26:32.843 --> 26:35.220
it would hurt so bad, I used to punch her.

26:35.220 --> 26:36.388
You did?

26:36.388 --> 26:38.849
Yes, but do not get any ideas.

26:42.144 --> 26:43.979
My mom died in a plane crash.

26:49.985 --> 26:53.447
Yeah. I'm really sorry.

26:56.283 --> 26:58.243
There was only one boy who lived.

27:00.287 --> 27:01.705
Yeah, I heard that.

27:04.875 --> 27:06.960
I wish it was my mom that lived.

27:08.253 --> 27:11.840
Yeah. That must be really, really hard.

27:13.884 --> 27:15.761
Did you lose someone in the crash?

27:16.386 --> 27:20.974
I did. But it wasn't my mommy.

27:22.017 --> 27:23.894
So, I don't know what that's like.

27:25.103 --> 27:26.104
Yeah.

27:55.801 --> 27:56.802
Hey.

27:59.763 --> 28:00.764
Hey, what's going on?

28:02.432 --> 28:03.433
This is my building.

28:12.985 --> 28:15.362
Hey. I'm sorry for asking about your dad.

28:15.362 --> 28:16.446
I'm an idiot. I--

28:17.573 --> 28:19.157
I won't do it again, okay?

28:20.325 --> 28:22.327
Yeah. No big deal.

28:26.623 --> 28:29.084
So, are you still gonna be my friend?

28:31.336 --> 28:32.963
Yeah, dummy, I'm still your friend.

28:34.381 --> 28:37.009
Can we seriously get some food now?
'Cause I'm seriously gonna faint.

28:38.135 --> 28:39.178
Yeah.

28:55.235 --> 28:57.946
Excuse me, are you a registered voter?

28:57.946 --> 28:59.573
I am.
-Here you go.

29:00.073 --> 29:02.492
Y'all live in Harlem? I love Harlem.
-For years. For years.

29:02.492 --> 29:04.536
Well, I knew your grandmother.
-You did?

29:04.536 --> 29:05.954
I'm so sorry about her.

29:05.954 --> 29:08.081
So, you guys just got here
from Miami? Welcome.

29:08.081 --> 29:10.000
This is Harlem. You're gonna love it here.

29:10.000 --> 29:14.171
I lived five blocks away. I grew up here.
I can show you all the good places.

29:14.171 --> 29:18.258
I can't take this anymore.
We need safety in our public schools.

29:18.258 --> 29:20.052
Yeah, isn't that right?
-Absolutely.

29:20.052 --> 29:23.639
I want to fight for you guys.
This is my home. I live here.

29:23.639 --> 29:25.516
I went to school
right up the street from here.

29:25.516 --> 29:27.434
PS 125, you know what I'm saying? Like--

29:27.434 --> 29:30.479
Hi. I'm Adriana Washington,
I'm running for Congress.

29:30.479 --> 29:33.357
I think we can all agree that we have
experienced so much division

29:33.357 --> 29:34.942
in the past couple of years.

29:34.942 --> 29:37.528
And I want that to change
and I want to fight for you.

29:37.528 --> 29:40.364
That's what my grandmother taught me
and that's exactly what I intend to do.

29:40.364 --> 29:42.908
Nice.
-Yeah.

29:42.908 --> 29:45.786
But thank you for your signatures.
Have a lovely rest of your day.

29:45.786 --> 29:47.746
Don't forget to vote
in the special election.

29:47.746 --> 29:49.414
So, with that, can I get your signature?

29:49.414 --> 29:51.416
You can sign right here.

29:51.416 --> 29:53.085
But only if you're feeling it.

29:53.085 --> 29:54.336
Hand me that pen.

29:54.336 --> 29:55.671
Can I get your signature?
-Absolutely.

29:55.671 --> 29:58.715
Wonderful. Here you go.

29:58.715 --> 30:02.511
Thank you. And you. Thank you so much.

30:02.511 --> 30:03.804
Thank you. See you.

30:03.804 --> 30:06.849
We did it! Good job! Yes!

30:17.609 --> 30:19.862
The best falafel in New York.

30:21.071 --> 30:22.781
Thanks, Faakhir.

30:36.461 --> 30:39.506
Seriously?
We went an hour out of our way for this?

30:40.340 --> 30:42.259
What are your feelings about radishes?

30:42.801 --> 30:44.344
Gross, obviously.

30:44.344 --> 30:47.055
Agreed. Okay, wait here.

30:51.351 --> 30:54.146
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

30:54.146 --> 30:58.609
Hey, Faakhir. Two falafels.
No radishes, extra tahini.

30:58.609 --> 31:00.485
Two black cherry sodas, the cold--

31:00.485 --> 31:02.613
The coldest I've got. I know.

31:04.907 --> 31:07.618
Don't tell me you got yourself
a girlfriend, huh?

31:08.702 --> 31:11.079
Her? She's not my girlfriend.

31:11.079 --> 31:14.333
She's not even, like, a girl.
She's from upstate.

31:14.333 --> 31:17.044
Upstate? What are you doing upstate?

31:21.048 --> 31:22.049
Nothing really.

31:23.842 --> 31:27.763
So, how's your brother?
I haven't seen either of you in weeks.

31:28.555 --> 31:31.433
For a minute, I thought you went to
a different falafel truck,

31:31.433 --> 31:35.145
and then I remembered
I'm the best falafel truck.

31:38.148 --> 31:40.817
He's good. Yeah. Jordan's good.

31:40.817 --> 31:42.444
He's flunking algebra,

31:42.444 --> 31:45.697
so my dad isn't letting him come
to the falafel truck until he passes.

31:45.697 --> 31:48.200
Well good for your dad.

31:48.200 --> 31:52.287
See, that's the problem with parents now.
They don't hold the line.

31:52.287 --> 31:54.373
You've got to hold the line.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.877
Yeah, my dad's really good at that.

31:58.877 --> 32:01.088
My mom,
we can get anything we want from her,

32:01.088 --> 32:02.589
but my dad can be tough.

32:02.589 --> 32:05.676
They have the balance. Perfect parents.

32:06.593 --> 32:10.639
Well, I guess nothing's perfect.
Except maybe these.

32:11.223 --> 32:15.686
Extra tahina,
no radishes, two black cherries.

32:18.438 --> 32:22.651
And tell your brother to study up.
I miss him.

32:47.968 --> 32:49.553
Hey, are you okay?
-I have to go.

32:49.553 --> 32:51.638
What? Why?
-I have to go.

32:51.638 --> 32:53.849
But we just got here.
-I have to go now!

32:53.849 --> 32:55.392
We never should have come here.

32:57.186 --> 33:00.606
We hope we didn't make
a bad first impression yesterday.

33:00.606 --> 33:03.275
Oh, no. Not at all.

33:03.275 --> 33:05.235
I'm-- I totally understand.

33:05.235 --> 33:07.237
I'm sure it was quite odd.

33:07.779 --> 33:09.531
It's all so new.

33:11.241 --> 33:14.203
We're still a little bit raw, I'm afraid.

33:14.203 --> 33:17.372
Of course. No, it's-- Me too. It's okay.

33:18.916 --> 33:19.917
Linda.

33:21.460 --> 33:26.298
The three of us are connected now.
Intrinsically.

33:28.091 --> 33:29.635
Yeah, I guess so.

33:30.302 --> 33:34.139
Well, we wanna be there for the child.
Your child.

33:34.139 --> 33:35.516
Our grandchild.

33:37.351 --> 33:41.271
I appreciate that. I really do.
But I'm not asking for anything.

33:43.774 --> 33:46.735
Well,
we wanna be a part of the baby's life.

33:47.611 --> 33:49.530
I think Gary would want that as well.

33:49.530 --> 33:52.324
Of cour-- No, of course. And I want that.

33:53.116 --> 33:54.326
We've thought about this a lot,

33:54.326 --> 33:58.872
and we would like you
to consider living here with us.

34:03.418 --> 34:04.461
I'm sorry?

34:05.212 --> 34:08.215
We wanna support you.

34:08.215 --> 34:10.676
We want our grandchild to be in our lives.

34:13.929 --> 34:18.725
Right. Of course. But I live in New York.

34:18.725 --> 34:23.355
Well, what is your living situation
in New York for the baby?

34:23.938 --> 34:25.232
Well, right now I have roommates.

34:27.109 --> 34:30.612
It's not really set up for the baby,
but I was gonna move in with Gary.

34:30.612 --> 34:33.322
So I'm just sort of figuring that out.

34:33.322 --> 34:35.409
And what do you do for a living?

34:36.118 --> 34:37.703
At the moment, I'm hostessing.

34:37.703 --> 34:42.291
But I'm working towards getting my BA, so...

34:42.291 --> 34:44.333
That's wonderful.

34:44.333 --> 34:47.379
We'd love to help support you
finishing your education.

34:48.547 --> 34:50.257
Thank you so much. Really.

34:52.092 --> 34:56.346
But I just-- I just came to tell you
about your grandchild. That's it.

35:01.435 --> 35:06.273
That's not the only reason
you came here though, is it?

35:07.608 --> 35:10.027
If you're being honest with yourself?

35:10.027 --> 35:11.111
Honey.

35:11.111 --> 35:14.489
You just said you don't have
the right environment for the child.

35:14.489 --> 35:17.159
You don't have the money or the resources.

35:17.159 --> 35:19.494
You're not close with your parents.

35:20.662 --> 35:24.249
Not all of that is entirely true.
That's not the whole story.

35:24.249 --> 35:27.836
You said you haven't spoken to them.
They don't even know about your pregnancy.

35:27.836 --> 35:29.588
I was planning on telling them and--

35:29.588 --> 35:31.590
You're four months pregnant.

35:32.382 --> 35:35.135
The father of your child died
in a plane crash.

35:35.844 --> 35:39.556
You came here before you even went
to see your own parents.

35:41.934 --> 35:44.019
I can't go to my parents, that's true.

35:44.728 --> 35:48.065
But my life is in New York.
I live in New York.

35:48.941 --> 35:52.069
We--
-I don't even-- I don't really know you--

35:52.069 --> 35:55.405
You can't just think about
what's best for you anymore.

35:55.405 --> 35:57.950
You have to think
about what's best for this child.

37:13.942 --> 37:15.360
Hello.
-Hey...

37:16.945 --> 37:18.655
Hi, it's Linda.

37:18.655 --> 37:22.868
Hi. How's it going with
your boyfriend's parents?

37:23.911 --> 37:25.078
It was not so good.

37:26.246 --> 37:27.247
Oh, no.

37:27.247 --> 37:30.209
Yeah, I'm just really fucking alone.

37:32.085 --> 37:33.462
Anyway, how are you?

37:34.713 --> 37:35.714
I'm fine.

37:39.760 --> 37:40.761
Cool.

37:43.555 --> 37:44.598
Can I...

37:46.350 --> 37:48.685
Can I please-- Can I come over there?

37:53.398 --> 37:57.319
Yeah. Bring a bottle of Tito's.
And I'm low on cran.

37:59.571 --> 38:01.406
Okay. Bye.

38:09.373 --> 38:11.375
Go!

38:12.125 --> 38:13.836
Go.

38:14.962 --> 38:16.672
This food is delicious.
-Thank you.

38:16.672 --> 38:19.258
I like it as well.
-You like it too?

38:19.258 --> 38:21.009
She says she likes it.
-That's good.

38:21.009 --> 38:23.428
Somebody seems to have
found their appetite.

38:23.428 --> 38:25.472
You are eating. That's my Becks.

38:31.728 --> 38:32.729
Becks!

38:34.356 --> 38:37.025
Becks. You're cheering the wrong team.

38:37.609 --> 38:38.777
That's Cameroon, not Ghana.

38:38.777 --> 38:40.571
Sorry, Uncle Kojo.

38:40.571 --> 38:42.239
It's okay. You'll learn.

38:44.950 --> 38:45.951
It's okay.

38:47.077 --> 38:48.078
Time for bed.

38:48.078 --> 38:49.329
No!

38:49.329 --> 38:50.581
It's getting late.
-Okay.

38:52.249 --> 38:54.042
Hey, Kojo, look at the ball.

39:03.886 --> 39:04.887
Come on!

39:04.887 --> 39:06.680
Yeah! Yay!

39:11.518 --> 39:12.686
Thank you.

39:17.274 --> 39:19.276
You sleepy?
-We get to camp out.

39:19.276 --> 39:20.569
No.
-No?

39:20.569 --> 39:21.695
Yes.

39:21.695 --> 39:24.364
Okay. Inside.

39:25.991 --> 39:28.952
This restaurant was five blocks
from my apartment all these years,

39:28.952 --> 39:30.037
and I had no idea.
-Yes.

39:30.037 --> 39:32.247
I can sniff out good jollof anywhere.

39:33.749 --> 39:36.293
I can't believe we almost got
300 signatures today.

39:36.293 --> 39:37.669
I owe it all to you guys.

39:37.669 --> 39:39.505
That's okay.
-I'm not tired yet.

39:39.505 --> 39:41.048
I wanna stay up with Adriana.

39:41.048 --> 39:42.925
Becks.
-I will see you again soon.

39:42.925 --> 39:45.427
I promise, okay? Let's go.

39:45.427 --> 39:47.054
Yeah. It's open, it's open.

39:52.434 --> 39:53.769
Ta-da!

39:54.311 --> 39:57.648
No.

39:57.648 --> 40:00.359
Concentration, 64,
no repeats or hesitation.

40:00.359 --> 40:03.237
I go first, you go second.
Category is sea creatures.

40:03.237 --> 40:05.531
Eels.
-Crocodile.

40:05.531 --> 40:07.032
Sweetie, it's ready for you.

40:07.032 --> 40:08.492
Yes!
-Okay.

40:10.285 --> 40:11.328
Ta-da.

40:12.412 --> 40:13.956
This is my room?

40:13.956 --> 40:16.875
Yep. Come on, check it out.

40:17.751 --> 40:21.380
Listen, just tonight, okay?
Tomorrow we find another place.

40:21.380 --> 40:23.257
Well, stay as long as you want.

40:23.257 --> 40:26.218
Really. This place,
it gets creepy when no one's here.

40:26.885 --> 40:28.971
Can we stay? Please?

40:28.971 --> 40:32.099
Just tonight. Okay?

40:33.308 --> 40:37.396
Okay. Good night, my niece.

40:50.492 --> 40:51.493
Thank you.

40:51.493 --> 40:53.203
Yeah, course.

40:55.205 --> 40:59.418
So, good night, Congresswoman.

41:01.670 --> 41:03.046
I don't think so.

41:03.797 --> 41:04.673
I do.

41:11.513 --> 41:13.265
Well, good night.

41:14.308 --> 41:15.309
Good night.

41:23.317 --> 41:25.736
Yeah, they just wanted me to,
like, move in right there.

41:27.821 --> 41:29.781
You know, people can be so entitled.

41:32.075 --> 41:33.076
Is that funny?

41:36.705 --> 41:39.917
You think I made the right choice
by getting out of there?

41:39.917 --> 41:45.214
Oh, yeah. I mean, you were this close
to being Rosemary's Baby'd.

41:50.427 --> 41:52.095
You want another one?
-No, I'm good.

41:52.095 --> 41:55.641
This-- I'm nursing the juice.

41:56.391 --> 41:58.268
How are you doing with everything?

42:01.021 --> 42:04.066
You know, when I was growing up,
we moved around a lot.

42:04.066 --> 42:05.609
We didn't have much.

42:06.443 --> 42:09.530
You know, my father couldn't keep a job.
It was like that.

42:10.364 --> 42:13.242
My mother used to
call my father a hothead.

42:13.242 --> 42:16.203
You know,
today they call that emotional abuse.

42:17.746 --> 42:20.582
And so I got out of my house
when I was 17.

42:20.582 --> 42:23.168
You know, I star-- I went--
I was waiting tables

42:23.168 --> 42:26.463
at an IHOP in Paterson,
finishing high school.

42:27.339 --> 42:32.845
And, you know, I thought--
I was looking at cosmetology, maybe.

42:32.845 --> 42:35.472
And then Charles walked
into the IHOP one day.

42:35.973 --> 42:37.641
He was so goofy.

42:40.185 --> 42:43.230
Always smiling. Big old smile.
Big glint in his eye.

42:45.357 --> 42:50.070
After three weeks, we were living together
at this dump that he had in Denville.

42:51.154 --> 42:56.201
And right away,
we were more than a couple.

42:56.201 --> 42:58.537
We were a team. We were a unit.

42:58.537 --> 43:02.541
He was this ambitious worker bee,
and I was his life force.

43:03.041 --> 43:05.085
I would entertain the bosses

43:05.085 --> 43:08.881
and bond with the wives
and charm the husbands.

43:08.881 --> 43:10.465
And you know,

43:10.465 --> 43:15.971
Charles shot up the ladder like--
like a rocket.

43:15.971 --> 43:19.057
And we got so rich, Linda.

43:19.057 --> 43:21.018
I mean, really rich.

43:25.606 --> 43:28.525
And I have loved
every single solitary second of it.

43:31.028 --> 43:36.366
But I think, you know, maybe I loved it
so much that I put blinders on,

43:36.366 --> 43:39.119
because sometimes it didn't seem real.

43:40.746 --> 43:43.540
Now it turns out, maybe it wasn't,
you know.

43:55.928 --> 43:57.095
Are you okay?

43:58.055 --> 43:59.389
Yeah, I'm good.

44:00.724 --> 44:04.228
I'm fine. I'm gonna be fine. I'm fine.

44:08.273 --> 44:11.401
What is that?
-I don't know. You know, the "Wreck Room."

44:11.401 --> 44:15.113
It's like some depraved sex club,
probably.

44:15.113 --> 44:17.866
No. It's not a sex club.

44:19.201 --> 44:21.662
It's the-- It's one of those things
where you, like, go,

44:22.829 --> 44:24.373
like, break a bunch of things.

44:24.373 --> 44:26.416
What? Fucking LA.

44:26.416 --> 44:28.502
They have them in New York too, actually.

44:28.502 --> 44:30.295
What do you mean
"break a bunch of things"?

44:30.295 --> 44:33.966
You go like knock the shit out of stuff?
I don't understand.

44:33.966 --> 44:35.133
Yeah, pretty much.

44:37.219 --> 44:38.220
That's ridiculous.

44:56.071 --> 44:57.072
Hey.

45:02.911 --> 45:03.912
How was video games?

45:04.913 --> 45:06.248
We didn't play video games.

45:06.874 --> 45:09.126
I thought that was-- What you guys do?

45:09.710 --> 45:10.794
We went to the city.

45:14.089 --> 45:15.090
What city?

45:16.008 --> 45:18.302
Manhattan. We went to Manhattan.

45:19.136 --> 45:22.055
You and Shay? Went to Manhattan?

45:23.807 --> 45:25.601
With Besa?
-No.

45:25.601 --> 45:27.352
How did you even--
-We took the bus.

45:28.896 --> 45:32.274
Okay. So Eddie, that is--
-Edward.

45:32.274 --> 45:33.567
My name is Edward.

45:33.567 --> 45:36.195
Will you please just call me Edward?

45:39.907 --> 45:46.413
Edward, you cannot go
into the city without telling me. Ever.

46:19.112 --> 46:21.990
You just wanna do it clean,
all the way across.

46:22.574 --> 46:25.994
Uh-huh. That's great. Yep. Keep going.

47:05.284 --> 47:08.412
Clean through. Now pull it back.

47:12.332 --> 47:17.296
Now pull that.
You can release it. Pull it off.

47:22.885 --> 47:25.345
It's perfect. All right, you're hired.

48:07.387 --> 48:08.764
Can we do another one?

48:08.764 --> 48:09.890
Yeah.
