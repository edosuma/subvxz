WEBVTT

00:14.097 --> 00:16.641
I'm worried about Abby
crawling in bed with us last night.

00:16.725 --> 00:20.478
She hasn't done that since she was eight.
She must be having trouble coping.

00:20.562 --> 00:23.440
God, there's so many ways
to mess up your children.

00:23.940 --> 00:26.109
At least we didn't over-praise her, right?

00:28.528 --> 00:29.696
Honey?

00:31.406 --> 00:33.825
We have to kill somebody today
so you can eat them, sweetheart.

00:34.409 --> 00:35.577
I'm worried about Abby, too,

00:35.660 --> 00:38.830
but I can't stop thinking about
the murdering and eating thing.

00:39.497 --> 00:43.710
I know we have to kill somebody today
but we have to be parents every day.

00:48.757 --> 00:51.926
God, I'm so hungry.
I haven't eaten in two days.

00:52.510 --> 00:56.306
-I know.
-How's that omelet, sweetie? Good?

00:56.389 --> 00:59.309
Yeah, I'm trying this new thing
with the sundried tomat--

01:01.895 --> 01:03.730
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:05.148 --> 01:07.025
Just swallow what's in your mouth.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.152
[gulps]

01:09.235 --> 01:11.404
Do you remember that dinner
we had in Tuscany?

01:11.488 --> 01:14.032
-On the terrace, outside the castle.
-[sighs]

01:14.115 --> 01:17.786
I keep thinking about how good
that waiter would taste right now.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.329
[footsteps approaching]

01:19.412 --> 01:21.790
Running late.
I'll grab something at Starbucks.

01:25.835 --> 01:27.754
Wait a second, sweetie.

01:28.838 --> 01:31.633
I know there's been a lot of changes
in the last couple days

01:31.716 --> 01:32.717
but one thing hasn't.

01:32.801 --> 01:36.679
Your father and I are here for you
if you ever need to talk.

01:36.763 --> 01:40.475
I have an idea. Starting tonight,
we should have regular family dinners.

01:40.558 --> 01:42.644
Tell each other what's on our mind.
No judgments.

01:44.312 --> 01:46.272
Like the kind I see
in your face right now.

01:46.356 --> 01:47.565
Sounds awesome.

01:47.649 --> 01:50.276
So what, or should I say who,
are we eating tonight?

01:50.860 --> 01:51.820
Whom.

01:51.903 --> 01:56.783
And as I've told you, from now on
I'll only be eating raw chicken and beef.

01:56.866 --> 01:59.702
And we'll be having a side dish
of "How's Abby doing?"

01:59.786 --> 02:01.329
And maybe some Spanish rice.

02:01.412 --> 02:03.873
You really wanna know how Abby's doing?

02:03.957 --> 02:06.501
Abby doesn't like that her parents
are all up in her B.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.254
Your butt?

02:10.255 --> 02:12.590
No! God! My business!

02:12.674 --> 02:16.010
Oh. Okay, well,
have a good day at schoo--

02:17.220 --> 02:19.889
I feel bad lying to her
but I don't want Abby to know

02:19.973 --> 02:21.683
her parents
are going to be killing people.

02:21.766 --> 02:24.060
Yeah, she thinks so little of us already.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.478
So, I was thinking:

02:25.562 --> 02:27.480
if we're gonna do this,
we have to do it right.

02:27.564 --> 02:29.065
We can't just kill anybody.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.942
We have to kill someone
who won't be missed.

02:31.025 --> 02:33.069
-Someone without a family.
-Right.

02:33.153 --> 02:36.656
-And someone bad who deserves it.
-Ooh, yeah, like who?

02:36.739 --> 02:40.160
I don't know. I guess the prototype
would be a young, single Hitler.

02:40.243 --> 02:42.328
Oh, God. We'd be heroes.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.331
And when we do find someone,
we have to be prepared.

02:45.415 --> 02:48.209
-No more impulse killing, it's too risky.
-Totally.

02:48.293 --> 02:53.047
We have to get tarps, gloves, mops,
sponges, bleach to clean up the blood...

02:54.173 --> 02:58.720
All the blood. So much blood.
Blood everywhere.

02:58.803 --> 03:00.179
-Hon?
-Yeah?

03:00.263 --> 03:01.931
You don't have to go with me.

03:02.015 --> 03:05.852
I'm not sending you out to do this alone,
sweetheart. We're doing it together.

03:06.436 --> 03:07.687
Aww.

03:07.770 --> 03:11.274
But I'll do the actual killing, okay?
So you don't have to worry about that.

03:12.108 --> 03:13.026
Yay.

03:14.527 --> 03:15.778
[sighs]

03:15.862 --> 03:19.824
I am so glad this is not one of those
diseases that dries your skin out.

03:20.408 --> 03:22.702
Yeah, that'd be the worst.

03:22.785 --> 03:25.788
What if we kill that dentist
who got that woman pregnant

03:25.872 --> 03:27.540
while she was having her wisdom teeth out?

03:27.624 --> 03:32.462
-I think that was just a Lifetime movie.
-Oh, yeah, those are fun.

03:33.087 --> 03:36.633
Hey, what about that shitty woman
in my yoga class?

03:36.716 --> 03:40.345
-Doesn't she have kids?
-Yeah, but they're shitty, too.

03:40.428 --> 03:42.639
I'm sorry, it's the hunger talking.

03:42.722 --> 03:45.308
Man, where are all
the young, single Hitlers?

03:45.391 --> 03:47.435
Speaking of Hitler, your mom called.

03:47.518 --> 03:50.355
She says she has a friend
that might have a listing for us.

03:50.438 --> 03:53.608
Was it Joan? She has that amazing
four-bedroom on Blue Ridge.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.653
By the way,
your mom's not so easy either.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.655
That's the house.
Swimmer's pool, chef's kitchen,

03:58.738 --> 04:01.741
and at least my mom doesn't ask me
every week why we only had one kid.

04:01.824 --> 04:05.787
Can we get back to killing people?
I feel like that's a less loaded subject.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.624
[window whirring]

04:10.583 --> 04:13.628
-You know how fast you were going?
-What?

04:14.212 --> 04:17.048
-Cop humor. Went over your head, Joel.
-Ah. [chuckles]

04:17.131 --> 04:20.468
Just wondering, what kind of spray
are you using on those ants of yours?

04:20.551 --> 04:21.761
What kind of ant spray?

04:21.844 --> 04:24.347
You told me you were spraying ants
in the middle of the night.

04:24.430 --> 04:28.851
-Now I wanna know what you were using.
-Why do you do this, Dan?

04:28.935 --> 04:31.938
I'm just asking my neighbor
a friendly question.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.148
Well, Joel?

04:34.232 --> 04:36.025
I don't know.

04:36.109 --> 04:40.363
Ants Away, Ants Be Gone,
Fuck You, Ants.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.073
Fuck You, Ants.

04:43.157 --> 04:45.535
You people need to take this
more seriously.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.537
You never want a sloppy kill.

04:47.620 --> 04:48.746
You leave anything behind,

04:48.830 --> 04:51.666
it's gonna come back
and bite you in the ass.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.962
Joel, Sheila.

05:05.054 --> 05:07.140
[squeaking]

05:07.223 --> 05:10.727
-I'm telling you, he's onto us.
-We don't know that.

05:10.810 --> 05:13.938
Who talks about ants
with that much intensity and innuendo?

05:14.522 --> 05:16.357
Maybe he's just obsessed with them.

05:16.899 --> 05:19.652
Did you know that ants can carry
up to 50 times their weight?

05:19.736 --> 05:22.071
They're not uninteresting creatures, Joel.

05:22.155 --> 05:25.241
We should buy some other stuff
so we don't look suspicious.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.243
Suspicious that we're cleaning our house?

05:27.327 --> 05:30.371
We also need taco shells for Taco Tuesday.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.248
Which gets so messy.

05:33.750 --> 05:36.794
I feel bad that I wasted so much of Gary.

05:36.878 --> 05:41.257
We recycle, we compost,
and yet I threw away 150 pounds of meat.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.092
You ate much as you could, honey.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.762
Even Gary wouldn't have expected you
to finish him.

05:45.845 --> 05:46.763
Oh.

05:48.264 --> 05:50.266
Flash-frozen seafood.

05:51.559 --> 05:55.396
That looks good to you?
We never tried to feed you a fish.

05:56.606 --> 05:59.400
We're gonna have to work
on how you talk about me.

05:59.484 --> 06:03.321
No. Frozen is the closest thing to fresh.

06:03.404 --> 06:05.948
What if we got a meat freezer
and put it in the storage unit

06:06.032 --> 06:09.452
and when we kill somebody,
we can just chisel off chunks of it

06:09.535 --> 06:12.163
when I need to eat.
No more waste.

06:12.914 --> 06:13.915
Wow.

06:13.998 --> 06:15.708
There's gonna be chiseling.

06:16.292 --> 06:18.795
Sweetie, I can do this on my own.

06:21.339 --> 06:25.134
No, I'm going with you. I'm fine.

06:29.472 --> 06:30.848
Oh, Jesus.

06:35.561 --> 06:38.189
Hey, I was thinking, uh,
maybe instead of ditching again today,

06:38.272 --> 06:40.942
we could go to class
as an act of rebellion?

06:41.275 --> 06:43.444
Like the sit-ins
of the Civil Rights Movement.

06:43.820 --> 06:47.281
Except we'll be sitting at desks
and have no real moral imperative.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.325
After everything that's happened
the last couple of days,

06:49.409 --> 06:52.203
school's too boring.
I want to do something exciting.

06:52.870 --> 06:55.665
-Janie Lewis ran across the freeway.
-So that's out.

06:56.207 --> 06:59.127
Oh, my stepdad has a bunch
of intense riot gear in the garage.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.546
Sometimes my friend Jackson and I
will put on the body armor

07:01.629 --> 07:04.048
and just hit each other
with sticks... hard.

07:05.174 --> 07:06.384
You can barely feel it.

07:07.468 --> 07:08.845
Even in the balls. So...

07:08.928 --> 07:11.097
-I don't want to do that.
-It's not for everyone.

07:12.014 --> 07:15.309
-Hey, Six Minute Abs. Robot Guy.
-Oh, it's Eric.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.687
It's okay. Hi, Sarah Elizabeth Newton.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.313
What are you doing here?
You don't ditch school.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.691
-Just trying shit out.
-I love that for you.

07:21.774 --> 07:22.900
I once bought a ferret.

07:24.402 --> 07:28.281
I mean, if we're all talking about
trying shit out, I bought a ferret.

07:31.159 --> 07:33.411
Okay, are you ditching today, too?
Do you wanna hang out?

07:33.494 --> 07:35.246
Oh, no, I can't. I'm seeing Cole.

07:35.329 --> 07:37.331
Look what he got me
for our three-month anniversary.

07:37.415 --> 07:38.875
God, he's such a sweet boy.

07:39.917 --> 07:42.879
He's not a boy, Sarah.
I mean, he's a 26-year-old drug dealer

07:42.962 --> 07:46.215
who drives a car that says,
"Ask me about my tiny dick."

07:46.299 --> 07:47.925
[engine revving]

07:48.009 --> 07:49.302
Yo, Sarah.

07:50.887 --> 07:53.222
Don't be jealous.
I just have an exciting life.

07:53.306 --> 07:56.225
And by the way,
it is a perfect starter dick.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.019
I love you, okay? I'll call you tonight.

07:58.519 --> 08:00.730
Yeah, I don't have
an exciting life at all.

08:00.813 --> 08:02.315
I mean, I just have an undead mom

08:02.398 --> 08:04.650
and we buried a half-eaten corpse
in the desert.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.736
-Your mom really raised the bar.
-[chuckles]

08:07.236 --> 08:09.155
I just wish I could think
of something super fun to do.

08:09.238 --> 08:10.656
Mmm.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.825
-Do you like games that test your--?
-No.

08:12.909 --> 08:13.951
Yeah, me neither.

08:14.660 --> 08:17.079
It's okay,
it's not your job to make me happy.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.123
Sounds like it was and I just got fired.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.084
He broke up with me.

08:22.168 --> 08:25.296
He didn't even get out of his car
and he took my quesadilla.

08:26.088 --> 08:30.218
-He drive-thru dumped me.
-That jerk. I'm sorry, Sarah.

08:30.301 --> 08:33.262
-You can have one of my taquitos.
-I don't want a taquito.

08:34.639 --> 08:38.684
That middle-aged fuck boy.
And I left my blue sweater at his house.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.811
The one I got you for your birthday?
I love that sweater.

08:40.895 --> 08:44.148
-I love that sweater.
-[groans] Men are such assholes.

08:45.733 --> 08:46.859
I wanna get back at him.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.489
That's something we could do today.

08:52.573 --> 08:54.617
Go after a drug dealer?
That sounds a little dangerous.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.035
I know, right?

08:58.454 --> 09:00.998
Yeah, for sure, we should lean into that.

09:08.548 --> 09:12.802
Well, we bought a freezer
to keep bodies in, so that's done.

09:12.885 --> 09:16.097
All we need now
is someone who's evil, deserving,

09:16.180 --> 09:19.350
won't be missed,
and is under 18 cubic feet.

09:19.433 --> 09:20.935
We're not killing my mother.

09:21.018 --> 09:22.270
I wasn't suggesting that,

09:22.353 --> 09:24.981
but it's so interesting
that's where your mind went.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.358
[stomach rumbling]

09:27.441 --> 09:28.943
My stomach's growling.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.075
[Joel] Hey, Rick.

09:37.326 --> 09:38.160
Hi, Rick.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.579
[chuckles] Hey.

09:39.662 --> 09:43.165
Sorry. I was listening
to a cooking podcast. Very relaxing.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.543
Did you know, broccoli, cauliflower,

09:45.626 --> 09:47.545
and Brussels sprouts
are all from the same family?

09:47.628 --> 09:49.880
Awesome. So you're a cop.

09:49.964 --> 09:52.008
Are there any criminals
who live in this neighborhood?

09:52.091 --> 09:55.886
You know, real animals, society's waste,
people so bad that they live alone.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.680
The reason we ask
is 'cause we have some clients

09:57.763 --> 10:00.641
who want to know about crime
and specifically where bad people live.

10:00.725 --> 10:03.311
-Well, this neighborhood's pretty good.
-[both] Oh.

10:03.394 --> 10:05.605
But a pedophile
just moved in down the street.

10:05.688 --> 10:07.273
-[both] Oh?
-Mm-hmm.

10:07.356 --> 10:08.983
A pedophile's perfect.

10:10.693 --> 10:14.739
Yeah, perfect.
That's just what we need, right?

10:14.822 --> 10:17.158
At least your kid is 16
and past her prime.

10:17.241 --> 10:18.367
I got a six-month-old.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.412
[stammers] I'm not saying
your daughter's not desirable.

10:21.495 --> 10:24.457
I'm just saying she's not toddler hot.
To a pedophile.

10:25.333 --> 10:26.667
That's how they talk.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.253
So, what's this guy look like?

10:30.296 --> 10:32.965
About 35, Italian, beefy.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.676
[sighing]

10:35.760 --> 10:39.639
So this beefy Italian, walking distance?

10:39.722 --> 10:42.600
Don't worry about it.
All pedophiles are on the registry.

10:42.683 --> 10:43.851
Very closely monitored.

10:43.934 --> 10:46.145
-Really?
-Yeah, sick bastards.

10:46.228 --> 10:48.773
They can't even buy a bottle of lotion
without us knowing about it.

10:50.566 --> 10:54.528
Oh, look, Mr. Bumblebee
found my rosemary. [chuckles]

10:57.490 --> 11:00.910
Just remember
there are no bad ideas in spitballing.

11:00.993 --> 11:02.495
What if I eat Rick?

11:03.412 --> 11:05.373
I think there might be bad ideas
in spitballing.

11:05.456 --> 11:06.707
You can't eat our neighbor.

11:06.791 --> 11:10.753
Oh, he's knee-deep in his herb garden,
the man is seasoning himself.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.214
I need food. I'm losing my mind.

11:13.297 --> 11:16.008
[sighs] Why is it so hard
to find someone to kill?

11:16.092 --> 11:17.093
Every time I get coffee,

11:17.176 --> 11:19.345
there's some dipshit
yelling at the barista.

11:19.845 --> 11:23.557
Maybe I get back at Cole
by sending a dozen pizzas to his house.

11:23.641 --> 11:25.142
No, we have to think bigger than that.

11:25.226 --> 11:28.312
-We need something epic, unforgettable.
-Yet proportionate.

11:28.396 --> 11:29.522
Screw proportionate.

-Shh, Abby's home.
-[door opens]

11:31.982 --> 11:35.444
I mean, we're talking about a guy
who is literally the worst person ever.

11:36.112 --> 11:38.447
-"Worst person ever."
-I'm interested.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.824
[Eric] The man is a monster.

11:39.907 --> 11:42.451
[Abby] Yeah, he's 26
and has sex with underage girls.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.453
[whispers] Ooh, I like the sound of that.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.581
-Plus, he sells drugs to kids.
-[whispers] He sells drugs to kids.

11:47.665 --> 11:48.582
Ahh-cha!

11:48.666 --> 11:50.918
I swear, I had no idea about that
when we started dating.

11:51.001 --> 11:52.878
[Abby] His Instagram is KidWeed.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.487
Did you know, in three weeks
we'll have had this listing for a year?

12:18.571 --> 12:20.948
It's not our fault. It's priced too high,

12:21.031 --> 12:25.453
the seller won't come down,
and there's about to be a murder in here.

12:25.536 --> 12:27.455
Hey, if you can, try to keep it contained.

12:27.538 --> 12:30.875
Not to be critical, honey, but Gary
looked like he swallowed some TNT.

12:30.958 --> 12:34.462
It's no worse than what you did
to the turkey on Thanksgiving.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.797
-We need new knives.
-So buy some.

-It's good to meet you.
-Great to meet you.

Why are you guys dressed like that?

13:18.881 --> 13:20.633
Are you, like, coloring
each other's hair or something?

13:20.716 --> 13:23.385
No, but that would've been
a good explanation.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.221
Actually, we're real estate brokers

13:25.304 --> 13:27.389
who have been having trouble
selling this place.

13:27.473 --> 13:31.018
Eager to make it more appealing,
we're repainting the kitchen. Get in here.

13:31.101 --> 13:32.436
[chuckles] Okay.

13:35.189 --> 13:38.359
-We should act more normal.
-I'm doing the best I can.

13:38.442 --> 13:40.486
Can I get you a water drink, Cole?

13:40.569 --> 13:43.531
Actually, I had a couple beers
on the drive over, so I'm good.

13:43.614 --> 13:45.741
You guys couldn't have picked
a better place to make a buy.

13:45.824 --> 13:47.618

going down in here!" [laughs]

13:56.085 --> 13:57.378
We'll see.

13:57.461 --> 14:01.799
You guys ordered a half ounce
of Skywalker OG Kush,

14:01.882 --> 14:04.844
-which is an excellent choice, by the way.
-Oh, my God, this is really happening.

It might be about that listing
on Blue Ridge. I gotta take this.

-It has a swimmer's pool.

14:38.252 --> 14:39.879
Do we have to wait for her?

14:40.504 --> 14:41.797
Absolutely.

She has the money.

14:52.141 --> 14:54.226
Man, I had a shitty day today.

14:54.518 --> 14:57.813
This girl I've been seeing, told me
she was 21, turned out to be 16.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.899
Obviously, I had to break it off
with her, mmm.

15:01.859 --> 15:03.527
-You had no idea?
-No.

15:03.611 --> 15:06.780
What kills me is I actually...
I kinda liked her.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.283
Maybe we shouldn't talk.

15:10.492 --> 15:12.995
-Why not?
-It saddens me.

15:14.371 --> 15:16.415
Mind if I smoke a little weed
while we wait?

15:19.585 --> 15:24.590
[inhaling] So... selling drugs to kids,
that seems pretty fucked up.

15:25.382 --> 15:27.551
Well, it wasn't part of the plan, dude.
You know?

15:27.635 --> 15:30.554
I mean,
I started selling pot in high school.

15:30.638 --> 15:33.641
I grew up, I tried to get out of it
and my dumb sister gets a divorce

15:33.724 --> 15:35.434
so I end up having to help her out.

15:36.769 --> 15:40.731
Sometimes you do shit you never expected
for the people you love.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.943
That is so true.

15:45.527 --> 15:48.572
I know, but then I look at you
and I think you got a great career.

15:48.656 --> 15:52.368
You got a great wife. It's like,
"How do I get my face in front of a house,

15:52.451 --> 15:55.204
on a sweet sign
next to a sweet lady like that?"

15:55.621 --> 15:57.790
[chuckles] It's easy.

15:58.415 --> 16:01.293
First, you're a high school quarterback
and prom king

16:01.377 --> 16:03.671
-and you date the prom queen.
-Mm.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.339
After school you think
you're pretty hot shit,

16:05.422 --> 16:06.966
so you coast for a while.

16:07.883 --> 16:10.594
Try music.
You're a decent guitar player, not great.

16:10.678 --> 16:14.765
So... you take a few classes
in hotel management. Try improv.

16:14.848 --> 16:17.059
But your object work
is never what you want it to be.

16:17.142 --> 16:18.519
What's-- What's object work?

16:18.602 --> 16:21.230
It's like making a fucking sandwich,
only it's not really there.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.816
-Oh. It's like being a mime?
-No.

16:24.441 --> 16:27.820
Because you can talk about the sandwich,
which is also bad improv.

16:27.903 --> 16:32.574
Anyway, by this point, I'm married,
we have a kid, it's time to get serious.

16:32.908 --> 16:34.284
My wife is a realtor.

16:35.077 --> 16:38.455
I wake up one day and... so am I.

16:39.373 --> 16:40.666
I'm not complaining.

16:40.749 --> 16:43.043
I work my own hours,
I only see my boss twice a week.

16:43.127 --> 16:45.546
It's just not where I saw my life going.

16:46.630 --> 16:48.090
-Wow, man, that's just--
-And now...

16:48.173 --> 16:51.218
Jesus Christ,
if I told you the crazy shit happening,

16:51.301 --> 16:53.012
you'd put me in an asylum.

16:54.221 --> 16:57.474
It's like my life is spiraling
toward disaster and there's no way out.

16:57.558 --> 17:00.144
The worst part is, I can't even talk
about it with the person I love the most

17:00.227 --> 17:02.855
because she'll blame herself,
and that's not what I want.

and a really good listener.

in an overpriced Spanish revival.

and you bond with my dinner?

-We had a lot in common.
-Yeah, you're both high.

17:55.157 --> 17:58.994
You know, I gotta say,
sometimes your pot smoking bugs me.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.538
Well, I don't like that you're gonna be
killing and eating people,

18:01.622 --> 18:03.457
so we both have things that bug us.

18:03.540 --> 18:05.584
And by the way,
they're legalizing my thing.

22:43.820 --> 22:45.280
Porsche guy was from Nevada.

22:45.363 --> 22:48.158
He owned a strip club
and a waste management company.

22:49.409 --> 22:51.161
Oh, nothing sketchy there.

22:51.244 --> 22:52.746
-Any family photos?
-Nope.

22:52.829 --> 22:56.124
I found pictures of a few women
but they were taken from inside a toilet,

22:56.208 --> 22:58.543
so probably not serious relationships.

22:58.627 --> 23:00.712
Maybe he won't be missed.

23:01.671 --> 23:05.383
What a night. We're gonna be okay.

23:06.468 --> 23:10.597
-I love you, Joel, so much.
-I love you too.

23:11.890 --> 23:15.310
23 years and you still find a way
to keep life exciting.

23:17.896 --> 23:21.566
-We have our family dinner tonight.
-We can't go home to Abby like this.

23:21.650 --> 23:24.027
Don't we have old clothes
in some of those boxes?

23:32.577 --> 23:33.870
Mmm.

23:34.579 --> 23:37.749
-How was your day?
-Good. Yours?

23:38.333 --> 23:39.459
Good.

23:40.335 --> 23:43.421
-Did anything interesting happen?
-Not really. You?

23:44.714 --> 23:46.258
-No.
-What are you eating?

23:49.052 --> 23:51.304
Raw beef. How's your shrimp?

23:51.930 --> 23:54.933
-Oh. Good.
-You know why?

23:55.016 --> 23:56.935
Because it's flash frozen,

23:57.018 --> 24:00.230
and that's what keeps it
so pink and fresh.

24:00.313 --> 24:04.484
Oh, I forgot,
Joan is going to give us that listing.

24:07.696 --> 24:09.656
-Honey?
-Are you okay, Dad?

24:10.657 --> 24:12.868
Yeah, I'm good.
