How was school, kids?
Actually pretty great.

00:38.239 --> 00:40.432
So, there I was,
at the drinking fountain...

00:40.474 --> 00:42.201
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
my day was better.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.136
I won the contest I entered.

00:44.178 --> 00:46.171
We won the lifetime
supply of insoles?!

00:46.213 --> 00:47.706
No. Mm.

00:47.748 --> 00:49.274
The <i> Winthorpe Manor</i> LARP.

00:49.316 --> 00:51.110
Oh, I can't believe your
father and I get to stay

00:51.152 --> 00:53.946
at the actual estate where
they film my favorite show

00:53.988 --> 00:55.881
and we get to act like
the <i> Winthorpe</i> characters.

00:55.923 --> 00:58.150
W-Wait. I-I knew the first part.

00:58.192 --> 00:59.451
Wh-What was the last part?

00:59.493 --> 01:01.520
Act like
the <i> Winthorpe</i> characters.

01:01.562 --> 01:02.654
It still sounds wrong.

01:02.696 --> 01:03.956
We get to stay at the house

01:03.998 --> 01:05.491
where they film your
favorite TV show.

01:05.533 --> 01:08.994
Yes, and act like
the characters from the show.

01:09.036 --> 01:11.330
What part of LARP
don't you understand?

01:11.372 --> 01:12.464
What's a LARP?

01:12.506 --> 01:13.799
Live action role play.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.968
Geez, Dad, read a book.
Then act it out.

01:16.010 --> 01:18.837
All the guests will be
in character all weekend.

01:18.879 --> 01:21.707
Oh, God. Why-Why couldn't you
have won a normal contest?

01:21.749 --> 01:23.842
Because this is
the show I love, Bob.

01:23.884 --> 01:26.011
<i>Winthorpe Manor</i> is
the American <i> Downton Abbey.</i>

01:26.053 --> 01:27.546
I thought that was <i> Mike & Molly.</i>

01:27.588 --> 01:28.981
TINA:
<i>It weaves a colorful tapestry</i>

01:29.023 --> 01:30.549
<i>of what life was like in 1901</i>

01:30.591 --> 01:32.518
<i>for America's wealthiest
textile family</i>

01:32.560 --> 01:34.386
<i>and the men and women who had
the privilege to serve them.</i>

01:34.428 --> 01:37.056
Tina, maybe you should
go instead of me. Okay.

01:37.098 --> 01:39.591
Oh, sorry, baby, kids can't go.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.760
I guess they didn't
have kids in 1901.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.162
They were all
working in factories,

01:43.204 --> 01:44.363
getting covered in soot.

01:44.405 --> 01:46.265
Ooh, lucky?

01:46.307 --> 01:47.866
So, who's watching us
this weekend?

01:47.908 --> 01:50.202
A pushover? Not a pushover?

01:50.244 --> 01:51.537
We prefer a pushover.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.038
Your good friend, Teddy.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.007
Ah, the pushover-est.

01:55.049 --> 01:57.843
All right, off we go
back in time.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.278
Try not to alter the future.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.612
I hope you packed toilet paper.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.881
I think back then
it was just sheep.

02:02.923 --> 02:05.117
I always do.

02:05.159 --> 02:08.387
<i>(classical music playing)</i>

02:08.429 --> 02:10.354
Lin, it's been three
hours of this theme song.

02:10.396 --> 02:11.924
I know. (Gasps)

02:11.966 --> 02:13.892
Look, Bobby, there it is.

02:13.934 --> 02:15.227
Winthorpe Manor.

02:15.269 --> 02:16.228
BOB: That is... wow.

02:16.270 --> 02:17.529
I'm telling you, Bobby,

02:17.571 --> 02:19.565
this is the life
I was supposed to have.

02:19.607 --> 02:22.034
I was born a hundred
years too late.

02:22.076 --> 02:25.437
God's done some good work,
but he screwed up my birthday.

02:25.479 --> 02:29.475
(panting): Hi!

02:29.517 --> 02:30.976
Are you LARPers?

02:31.018 --> 02:32.444
We are. I'm Marshall.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.046
Nancy. Charlene.

02:34.088 --> 02:36.548
I'm Linda. (Exhales)

02:36.590 --> 02:38.250
Whoa, look at me.

02:38.292 --> 02:41.120
I'm wheezing up a storm,
like Bernice, the cook,

02:41.162 --> 02:43.455
when the squirrel
got into her pantry.

02:43.497 --> 02:47.059
(all laughing)

02:47.101 --> 02:48.627
(sighs)

02:48.669 --> 02:49.928
Oh, I-I-I've never
seen the show.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.163
(gasp)

02:51.205 --> 02:54.399
I know. I know.
It's awful. It's awful.

02:54.441 --> 02:55.934
TEDDY: <i>There we are.</i>

02:55.976 --> 02:57.469
All done. We are gonna have

02:57.511 --> 02:58.770
a weekend of fun
with this thing.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.506
Gene, you want to wear
the engineer's hat?

03:00.548 --> 03:01.907
Mm, yeah.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.742
Nope, I'm gonna wear it.
I'll let you wear it later.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.744
All aboa... (screams) Whoa!

03:05.786 --> 03:07.913
Oh, it's my back.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.281
I-I threw it out.

03:09.323 --> 03:10.816
Should we call a doctor?

03:10.858 --> 03:12.784
Or just go ahead and put you down?
No, no, no.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.953
I-I just need to lie here
for a couple of hours.

03:14.995 --> 03:15.954
It fixes itself.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.356
I get it, bro.

03:17.398 --> 03:18.790
I do that even when
my back's not out.

03:18.832 --> 03:21.593
(shouts) Sure, this isn't ideal,

03:21.635 --> 03:22.995
but we'll still have fun.

03:23.037 --> 03:24.997
Tell me, what-what's
the train's doing?

03:25.039 --> 03:26.832
Uh, it's going around.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.700
(laughs) I knew it.

03:28.742 --> 03:32.171
So, did you just die when you
found out you won the contest?

03:32.213 --> 03:35.807
Yes! I died and now I'm in...
♪<i> Heaven.</i> ♪

03:35.849 --> 03:37.142
Hey, where's your plus one?

03:37.184 --> 03:39.278
Oh, we do separate LARPs.
It works for us.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.113
Did everyone here
win the contest?

03:41.155 --> 03:42.548
No, just Linda and Nancy.

03:42.590 --> 03:43.882
The rest of us have the honor

03:43.924 --> 03:45.784
of paying a lot of money
for this experience.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.319
(gasps) Look. Someone's coming.

03:47.361 --> 03:50.622
Esteemed paying guests
and contest winners,

03:50.664 --> 03:54.893
I welcome you
to Winthorpe Manor.

03:54.935 --> 03:59.331
My name is Mr. Perkins and I
am the master of ceremonies.

03:59.373 --> 04:02.234
Do we have any experienced
LARPers in the group?

04:02.276 --> 04:04.136
Right here. My name's Ernie.

04:04.178 --> 04:06.705
I've done the, uh,<i> Star Wars</i>
LARP, the Tolkien LARP,

04:06.747 --> 04:08.907
the, uh,<i> World According to Garp</i>
LARP...

04:08.949 --> 04:11.977
Okay, so then you know that
while you're here, you will be

04:12.019 --> 04:13.245
randomly assigned characters.

04:13.287 --> 04:14.479
You will sleep in the room

04:14.521 --> 04:16.014
of your character... (gasps)

04:16.055 --> 04:18.483
eat the food they ate... Mmm.

04:18.524 --> 04:20.319
And wear their clothes.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.720
(gasps) I can't believe it.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.189
(gasps) William,
the underbutler.

04:24.231 --> 04:26.091
Oh, I love William.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.026
I'll be the best
William I can be,

04:28.068 --> 04:29.494
with a keen sense of duty,

04:29.536 --> 04:32.664
and I'm deaf in my
right ear starting now.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.733
Oliver, the footman. What?

04:34.775 --> 04:36.768
Oh, uh, Oliver the footman.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.737
Oh, oh, oh. Oh, hello, Oliver.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.839
Oh, I'm so nervous.
Okay, here it goes.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.574
Okay, oh... (gasps)

04:42.616 --> 04:45.944
Wow, Nancy, Mrs. Winthorpe.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.579
Good for you.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.081
I can't believe it.

04:49.123 --> 04:50.716
Come on, Linda, let's see
who you get to be.

04:50.758 --> 04:53.018
Okay, here I go.

04:53.060 --> 04:56.221
Iris, Mrs. Winthorpe's maid.

04:56.263 --> 04:58.023
Goodie, we'll be
working together.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.391
Well, I won't be working.

04:59.433 --> 05:03.028
You will, for me,
but we'll be together. Yay!

05:03.070 --> 05:06.064
Ah, I'm friggin'
Mr. Winthrop. Score.

05:06.106 --> 05:08.300
Would all the
upstairs characters

05:08.342 --> 05:10.302
please get into the auto?

05:10.344 --> 05:12.704
Is another car coming for us?
(laughing): Oh.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.473
An automobile is a luxury.

05:14.515 --> 05:17.709
Most servants go their entire
lives without riding in an auto.

05:17.751 --> 05:19.544
Right, right, right, sure.

05:19.586 --> 05:22.447
The long walk will allow us
to talk about current events.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.750
Did you hear about those
crazy Wright brothers?

05:24.792 --> 05:26.885
They're calling it
an "aeroplane."

05:26.927 --> 05:29.254
More like wrong brothers.
Am I right, Footman Oliver?

05:29.296 --> 05:30.489
Oh, God.

05:30.531 --> 05:31.890
MARSHALL: How's your syphilis?

05:31.932 --> 05:34.232
BOB: Um, uh, it's clearing up.

05:38.504 --> 05:41.233
Don't you all look
absolutely amazing.

05:41.275 --> 05:44.269
I trust everyone's comfortable
in your wardrobes?

05:44.311 --> 05:47.739
Uh, my uniform is itchy
and it smells like mold.

05:47.781 --> 05:50.275
As it would have
in 19-aught-one,

05:50.317 --> 05:52.311
when a servant of your stature
would have worn it.

05:52.353 --> 05:55.314
Oh. Now, just a couple
of topics to go over.

05:55.356 --> 05:59.685
While our LARP has been granted
access to every nook and cranny

05:59.727 --> 06:03.355
of this famous manor, there are
just a few restricted areas:

06:03.397 --> 06:05.590
The south wing, the east wing,
the central corridor

06:05.632 --> 06:07.492
and the entire third, fourth,
and fifth floors.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.194
Oh, whew, at least we get to go

06:09.236 --> 06:10.662
into the gorgeous library,
right?

06:10.704 --> 06:12.964
Oh, the library is
especially off limits.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.300
We're not even supposed
to look in there. Huh.

06:15.342 --> 06:17.469
And tomorrow we have
a big day planned.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.838
Upstairs guests and
their personal servants

06:19.880 --> 06:23.308
will be allowed to walk
through the famous tulip garden.

06:23.350 --> 06:24.543
That's you and me.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.611
Thank God, I was
beginning to think

06:26.653 --> 06:28.613
I wasn't gonna get
to do anything exciting.

06:28.655 --> 06:31.149
Why is a walk through the
tulip garden "exciting"?

06:31.191 --> 06:33.318
The tulip garden is
the pride of the manor.

06:33.360 --> 06:36.355
All major plot twists
happen in the tulip garden.

06:36.397 --> 06:38.523
It's where Humphrey professed
his love to Jacqueline

06:38.565 --> 06:41.293
on the eve of his wedding to Cicely.
Got it. Thank you.

06:41.335 --> 06:44.029
And we'll conclude this LARP
with quite a bang,

06:44.071 --> 06:46.031
a decadent seven-course meal,

06:46.073 --> 06:50.135
and the dessert
is Mrs. Winthorpe's favorite...

06:50.177 --> 06:53.038
ALL: Seven-layer parfait flambé.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.906
It's a seven-layer
parfait flambé.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.576
That's right.
The upstairs guests will enjoy

06:57.618 --> 07:00.979
an exact recreation
of the two-foot-high parfait

07:01.021 --> 07:03.248
that was served
in the season finale.

07:03.290 --> 07:06.051
It is now cocktail hour
in the drawing room.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.487
Ooh, cocktail hour
in the drawing room.

07:08.529 --> 07:10.355
Oh, which is
for upstairs guests.

07:10.397 --> 07:11.690
Oh, right.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.992
Remember, people,
this is your LARP.

07:14.034 --> 07:16.328
Bring your characters to life.

07:16.370 --> 07:18.830
And, Mr. Winthorpe,
our cooks were, in fact,

07:18.872 --> 07:21.166
able to provide you
with a gluten-free experience.

07:21.208 --> 07:22.441
Nice.

07:23.943 --> 07:25.704
How's that steamed
broccoli coming along?

07:25.746 --> 07:27.372
LOUISE: Nice and steamy.

07:27.414 --> 07:29.007
Great, 'cause
I promised your folks

07:29.049 --> 07:30.442
that I'd feed you healthy meals.

07:30.484 --> 07:31.543
And we appreciate it.

07:31.585 --> 07:32.677
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

07:32.719 --> 07:34.179
Does anyone else
feel a little bad?

07:34.221 --> 07:36.348
I mean, I know we wanted
a pushover for a babysitter,

07:36.390 --> 07:37.582
but this is... Perfect?

07:37.624 --> 07:39.851
'Cause we got a fall-over.
Right.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.019
Should we at least
bring him dinner?

07:41.061 --> 07:42.687
Sure. Hey, Teddy!

07:42.729 --> 07:43.955
Teddy! TEDDY: Yeah?

07:43.997 --> 07:45.557
You want some dinner?!

07:45.599 --> 07:48.460
Yeah, that'd be great,
but not that healthy crap.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.429
Just bring me some ice cream.
Oh.

07:50.471 --> 07:53.098
I hear this stew
is the only dish

07:53.140 --> 07:54.933
us servants get
to eat all weekend.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.536
It's everything a servant
needs, right, Iris?

07:57.578 --> 07:59.604
It's got all your
salt for the day.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.040
It's time to serve
dinner upstairs.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.475
But we just started eating.

08:03.517 --> 08:05.183
Spoons down! Aah!

08:07.420 --> 08:09.147
(whispering): This looks a
lot better than the stew.

08:09.189 --> 08:10.449
(whispering):
Let's drop some on the floor

08:10.491 --> 08:11.750
and come back for it later.

08:11.792 --> 08:12.784
Good idea.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.886
Oh. That's the Burgundy glass.

08:14.928 --> 08:17.289
Oh, right. Oh, Bordeaux.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.057
At least she knows that
wine goes in a glass.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.725
(laughs) (chuckles)

08:20.767 --> 08:22.961
Honey, Iris was kicked
in the head by a horse.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.830
She was? Yeah. In season two.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.565
Oh, right, right, right.

08:26.607 --> 08:30.068
Well, I think the lint pickers
are fairly compensated.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.069
Right, babe?

08:31.111 --> 08:32.504
Um, yes, dear.

08:32.546 --> 08:34.472
Five cents a day is
nothing to sneeze at.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.174
Five cents a day?

08:36.216 --> 08:39.410
It appears the footman has
an opinion on the matter.

08:39.453 --> 08:41.446
Eh. Go ahead, speak up.

08:41.488 --> 08:45.684
Oh, w-well, I just think that
with a house this, uh, grand,

08:45.726 --> 08:48.086
you could afford to
pay your workers more.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.088
What's your name, footman?

08:50.130 --> 08:52.858
Uh, Bob. I mean, I... Oliver.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.793
I like your moxie, Oliver.

08:54.835 --> 08:56.795
The men will be retiring
to the drawing room

08:56.837 --> 08:58.263
for cigars and brandy now.

08:58.305 --> 08:59.264
Come join us.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.765
Oh, no, that-that's okay.

09:00.807 --> 09:02.767
Yeah, it's valuable
for us wealthy men

09:02.809 --> 09:05.637
to understand a
worker's perspective.

09:05.679 --> 09:08.507
Yes, and you have a fine,
vigorous mustache.

09:08.549 --> 09:10.642
You clearly come
from superior stock.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.711
Oh, uh, thanks, I guess.

09:12.753 --> 09:14.846
Have fun talking men stuff
in the drawing room,

09:14.888 --> 09:16.214
which I haven't even seen yet.

09:16.256 --> 09:17.816
I'm not gonna have fun, Lin.

09:17.858 --> 09:19.851
I don't like brandy or cigars.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.821
One sip, one puff and I'll
meet you back in our room.

09:22.863 --> 09:25.323
I love cigars and brandy!

09:25.365 --> 09:28.226
I finally get why
people want to be rich!

09:28.268 --> 09:29.661
TEDDY: <i>Is it getting late?</i>

09:29.703 --> 09:30.729
Is it bedtime yet?

09:30.771 --> 09:32.531
Uh, not quite.

09:32.573 --> 09:34.866
It's definitely not 1:00 a.m.
Mm-mm.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.569
(groans) Well, I cannot
keep my eyes open.

09:37.611 --> 09:38.703
I don't know why.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.038
Can you toss a blankie my way?

09:40.080 --> 09:41.406
And if I could just trouble you

09:41.448 --> 09:42.874
for your least favorite
plastic receptacle

09:42.916 --> 09:44.242
and a smidge of privacy.

09:44.284 --> 09:46.344
Why? Oh. Mom's salad spinner?

09:46.386 --> 09:47.652
That'll work.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.582
Lin.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.150
Shh. I'm trying to sleep.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.818
(whispering): Sorry. Lin.

09:53.860 --> 09:55.520
What?

09:55.562 --> 09:57.856
I get the appeal of this place.
Hey, when we get home,

09:57.898 --> 09:59.558
I want to watch
<i>Winthorpe Manor</i> with you.

09:59.600 --> 10:00.759
What are you doing?

10:00.801 --> 10:02.260
Oh. Brushing my livery.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.062
One of the upstairs guys
lent me this brush.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.363
They invited me on the stroll

10:05.405 --> 10:06.665
through the tulip garden
tomorrow.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.700
(sighs) I'm glad
you're having fun.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.001
What's the matter?

10:10.043 --> 10:11.937
It's just not how
I pictured this weekend.

10:11.979 --> 10:14.406
I mean, I serve people
every day in the restaurant,

10:14.448 --> 10:15.941
and I thought I was
finally gonna get a chance

10:15.983 --> 10:17.776
to feel like
a wealthy upstairs lady.

10:17.818 --> 10:20.178
(sighs) At least I have
the tulip garden stroll

10:20.220 --> 10:21.580
to look forward to.

10:21.622 --> 10:24.115
Well, if you get all
your work done, I guess.

10:24.157 --> 10:26.284
(bell ringing)
I mean, you are behind.

10:26.326 --> 10:29.054
Uh, Mrs. Winthorpe
is ringing for you, Iris.

10:29.096 --> 10:30.522
Ugh, what does she want?

10:30.564 --> 10:31.790
I don't know.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.291
I've been ironing the newspaper,

10:33.333 --> 10:35.026
which I'm not good at.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.394
You rang?

10:36.436 --> 10:37.796
I'd like another pillow.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.898
Would you be so kind
as to fetch me one?

10:39.940 --> 10:41.600
Uh, sure.

10:41.642 --> 10:43.268
(snoring) (bell ringing)

10:43.310 --> 10:44.369
Really?

10:44.411 --> 10:46.738
You'd better
fetch me a bed wine.

10:46.780 --> 10:49.374
A bed wine? Right away.

10:49.416 --> 10:50.542
(snoring) (bell ringing)

10:50.584 --> 10:51.876
Aw, come on.

10:51.918 --> 10:54.045
Maybe one more bed wine.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.914
No, a bed gin.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.449
You know what,
just bring them both.

10:57.491 --> 10:58.717
Mm-hmm.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.552
Here's just a bunch
of everything

11:00.594 --> 11:02.954
so no need to ring
that bell anymore, 'kay?

11:02.996 --> 11:04.222
I see.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.057
(clears throat)
That'll be all then.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.726
Good night, Maid Iris.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.427
Good night. (Grumbles)

11:09.469 --> 11:11.229
What was that? Sweet dreams.

11:11.271 --> 11:12.998
TEDDY: <i>Morning, kids!</i>

11:13.040 --> 11:14.966
Oh, wow, you're
still right there.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.235
Okay, maybe we should
let someone besides the floor

11:17.277 --> 11:18.503
heal you.

11:18.545 --> 11:20.438
(groans) Fine.
I guess I should go

11:20.480 --> 11:22.107
to my chiropractor, Dr. Juarez.

11:22.149 --> 11:23.475
He's just a few blocks away.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.143
But how are we
gonna get you there?

11:25.185 --> 11:26.811
Huh. You kids have a gurney?

11:26.853 --> 11:29.414
Oh, we just got rid of
all our gurneys.

11:29.456 --> 11:30.949
(groans) Aw, man.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.917
Uh, well, we're gonna
have to build one, then.

11:32.959 --> 11:35.286
Okay, you may
have us confused with kids

11:35.328 --> 11:36.988
who know things or do stuff.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.431
Yeah, we're not
gurney MacGyvers.

11:41.133 --> 11:43.094
LINDA: Here we go, tulip time.

11:43.136 --> 11:45.096
And why exactly are you here?

11:45.138 --> 11:47.766
Oh, I was, uh, invited
to join the stroll.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.968
Oh, not you,
Footman Oliver, her.

11:50.010 --> 11:53.371
The chambermaids are allowed to
come on the tulip garden stroll.

11:53.413 --> 11:56.441
They are, but you aren't
my chambermaid anymore.

11:56.483 --> 11:57.442
I'm not?

11:57.484 --> 11:58.777
No, after last night,

11:58.819 --> 12:00.311
I decided to replace
you with someone

12:00.353 --> 12:02.047
who actually wanted
the position.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.348
Wha? Charlene?

12:03.390 --> 12:05.183
Be excited for me, Linda.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.153
You'll have whatever
Charlene's position was. Wha?!

12:08.195 --> 12:09.521
Lin, I'm so sorry.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.389
I-I know how much you were
looking forward to it.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.124
Oliver, you coming or not?

12:13.166 --> 12:14.993
Uh, I'll stay behind
if you want me to.

12:15.035 --> 12:17.796
No, go, go. One of us should go.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.197
You sure? 'Cause, I mean,

12:19.239 --> 12:20.965
I hear the tulips
are in pre-bloom,

12:21.007 --> 12:22.834
which is supposedly even
better than full bloom.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.175
Coming! Ugh!

12:26.245 --> 12:27.806
Nancy and those
upstairs fartfaces

12:27.848 --> 12:29.474
are walking all over us.

12:29.516 --> 12:31.876
Well, Iris, I don't
know any Nancy

12:31.918 --> 12:34.145
and I'm not familiar with
the term "fartfaces."

12:34.187 --> 12:35.380
Oh, come on, Marshall!

12:35.422 --> 12:37.082
I know you're in there.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.017
And I know you're just
as mad about this as I am.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.852
Okay, fine, I am angry.

12:40.894 --> 12:43.254
I paid good money to
be here, and for what?

12:43.296 --> 12:44.989
To put some guy's
socks on for him?

12:45.031 --> 12:46.758
He can't put his own socks on?

12:46.800 --> 12:48.026
They're socks.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.694
Put 'em on yourself, Paul!

12:49.736 --> 12:52.263
We didn't come to
Winthorpe Manor to snip wicks.

12:52.305 --> 12:53.898
No, we did not! OTHERS: No!

12:53.940 --> 12:56.568
The servants have been stuck
downstairs long enough!

12:56.610 --> 12:57.836
Yeah! Yeah, it's true.

12:57.878 --> 12:59.270
It's time we go upstairs!

12:59.312 --> 13:00.538
ALL: Yeah!

13:00.580 --> 13:01.840
Wait, what do you mean?

13:01.882 --> 13:03.374
I'm talking about a revolt.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.844
I'm talking about
a worker uprising.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.278
ALL: Yeah!

13:07.320 --> 13:08.780
But first, let's finish
snipping these wicks

13:08.822 --> 13:10.515
and clean up all the wicks
so it's nice and neat.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.791
All right. Yeah!

13:14.794 --> 13:17.055
MARSHALL:
<i>Are we sure about this?</i>

13:17.097 --> 13:19.958
A worker uprising
just seems so impolite.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.226
Yes, Marshall.

13:21.268 --> 13:23.294
We're making this LARP ours.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.029
Oh, wow, those were some tulips.

13:25.071 --> 13:26.898
More like "three-lips." (laughs)

13:26.940 --> 13:29.234
That-That's... that's what we
were saying in the garden.

13:29.276 --> 13:30.802
You-You had to be there.

13:30.844 --> 13:32.203
Wait, what's going on?

13:32.245 --> 13:33.438
Can we trust him?

13:33.480 --> 13:34.806
Yeah, I think so.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.274
The servants are gonna revolt.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.576
I see. Hmm, interesting.

13:38.618 --> 13:40.311
Sure, the servants
have been mistreated,

13:40.353 --> 13:42.147
no one's gonna argue that,

13:42.189 --> 13:43.882
but we're all experiencing life

13:43.924 --> 13:46.117
in one of the great
American houses.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.620
Will you stop pointing that
thing around when you talk?

13:48.662 --> 13:50.088
Doesn't make you sound smarter.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.290
Yes. It. Does.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.658
So what's the plan?

13:53.700 --> 13:55.393
How are we gonna pull off
an uprising?

13:55.435 --> 13:57.595
Uh, we got to hit 'em
where it hurts.

13:57.637 --> 13:58.930
(gasps) Dinner.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.765
We're gonna eat their dinner.

14:00.807 --> 14:02.834
Yes! Tonight is the
seven-course dinner

14:02.876 --> 14:05.136
with the seven-layer
parfait flambé!

14:05.178 --> 14:08.006
Oh, wow, they're gonna be pissed.
Good!

14:08.048 --> 14:10.441
But they're not gonna just
let us eat their dinner.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.811
Right, we got to find a way
to get them out of the house.

14:12.853 --> 14:14.779
Well, they're gonna be out of
the house at the shooting party.

14:14.821 --> 14:16.581
Shooting party?

14:16.623 --> 14:18.449
Yeah, they're all going to
shoot clay pigeons later.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.318
I mean, I was gonna go also.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.287
I-I don't know how this
revolt affects all that.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.789
I really kind of
want to do both.

14:24.831 --> 14:26.491
(growls) Mostly this.

14:26.533 --> 14:29.027
All right, so they're already
gonna be out of the house,

14:29.069 --> 14:30.929
we just need to keep
'em out of the house.

14:30.971 --> 14:34.132
I've got a plan! Does it involve
you shooting clay pigeons?

14:34.174 --> 14:36.668
Yes, it does because I've
always wanted to do that.

14:36.710 --> 14:39.170
But I've got an idea
that will happen

14:39.212 --> 14:41.339
right after it's
my turn to shoot.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.642
So you guys are sure it's okay
to take off the bathroom door?

14:44.684 --> 14:47.545
Eh, it's my least favorite door,
it just slows you down.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.881
You got the hammer and the screwdriver?
TINA: Yep.

14:49.923 --> 14:52.684
Just start at the bottom hinge
and do like I told you.

14:52.726 --> 14:53.952
Tap, tap, tap.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.119
Tapping!

14:55.161 --> 14:56.521
Now remember,

14:56.563 --> 14:58.022
someone's got to
hold the door or else...

14:58.064 --> 14:59.691
(crash) TINA: Aah! I'm okay.

14:59.733 --> 15:02.227
Now just flop me my belly,
then flop me on the door.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.028
Just line up the door
for the money flop.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.797
Isn't it gonna hurt to move you?

15:05.839 --> 15:08.800
Tremendously. But no matter how
much I cry, keep rolling me.

15:08.842 --> 15:11.002
Here goes.
(kids groaning, Teddy yells)

15:11.044 --> 15:12.370
Aah! Stop! Stop! Stop!

15:12.412 --> 15:13.538
Aah! Stop!

15:13.580 --> 15:15.406
Stop! Aah!

15:15.448 --> 15:18.509
Here comes the second flop.
(kids groaning)

15:18.551 --> 15:21.646
Aah! (Groaning in pain)

15:21.688 --> 15:23.014
That was horrible.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.249
But I'm on the door.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.084
On the door-ish.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.552
Wha? TINA: We'll get
it this time, Teddy.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.320
I think I know
what we did wrong.

15:29.362 --> 15:32.190
Are you sure the three of us are
strong enough to lower you down?

15:32.232 --> 15:34.692
Yup. Ropes and pulleys,
simple machine.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.861
Yeah, if anything,
this is almost too safe.

15:36.903 --> 15:38.363
Go ahead, start letting out
the rope.

15:38.405 --> 15:39.597
Go slow.

15:39.639 --> 15:40.832
TINA: It's working.

15:40.874 --> 15:41.833
We did it! High-five!

15:41.875 --> 15:43.067
No, no, no! No high-fives!

15:43.109 --> 15:44.235
Hands on ropes!

15:44.277 --> 15:47.312
(grunting)

15:49.481 --> 15:51.009
Oh, boy. Wheels.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.610
We forgot, we forgot wheels!

15:52.652 --> 15:53.878
How you doing?

15:53.920 --> 15:55.219
Good morning.

15:56.388 --> 15:57.348
Pull!

15:57.390 --> 15:58.616
(gunshot, smash)

15:58.658 --> 16:00.285
Oh, that's fun!

16:00.327 --> 16:02.420
Pull! (Gunshot, smash)

16:02.462 --> 16:03.688
Oh, that's fun again!

16:03.730 --> 16:06.925
Ugh, come on, Bobby,
anytime now.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.559
Uh, y-you guys keep shooting,

16:08.601 --> 16:10.795
no need to look
at Footman Oliver

16:10.837 --> 16:12.964
going about his servant stuff.

16:13.006 --> 16:15.433
(coughs) Whoops, syphilis cough.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.201
Let's fire up the engine.

16:17.243 --> 16:20.104
(engine starts)

16:20.146 --> 16:21.606
What's happening?

16:21.648 --> 16:23.374
Why are the servants in the auto?
Eh?

16:23.416 --> 16:25.143
Iris? Bob, let's go!

16:25.185 --> 16:27.078
Footman Oliver, what's going on?

16:27.120 --> 16:29.447
Yeah, I-I better see
what that's all about.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.082
It's a servant uprising!

16:31.124 --> 16:32.784
We're gonna eat your dinner.

16:32.826 --> 16:35.386
Our end-of-LARP
seven-course dinner?

16:35.428 --> 16:38.056
<i>Our</i> end-of-LARP
seven-course dinner.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.223
(all panting)

16:39.265 --> 16:40.558
But we're still on

16:40.600 --> 16:42.894
for cigars and brandy
later, right?

16:42.936 --> 16:44.329
LOUISE: Coming through, people!
(Teddy groaning)

16:44.371 --> 16:45.897
Make way!

16:45.939 --> 16:47.765
Move your stroller!

16:47.807 --> 16:49.634
Teddy, no one's looked
this good on a door

16:49.676 --> 16:51.002
since Kate Winslet in <i> Titanic.</i>

16:51.044 --> 16:52.403
How's the patient?

16:52.445 --> 16:53.938
The pain levels are
through the roof.

16:53.980 --> 16:55.640
But this view is unbeatable.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.408
It took throwing out my back
to appreciate

16:57.450 --> 16:59.077
how beautiful the power lines
are in this...

16:59.119 --> 17:00.645
Aah! In this town!

17:00.687 --> 17:01.913
Aah!

17:01.955 --> 17:04.248
LOUISE: We're here. Wait, what?

17:04.290 --> 17:06.818
KIDS: Closed?!
TINA: Look, he left a note.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.153
"Closed today for my
niece's quinceañera."

17:09.194 --> 17:10.821
Aw.

17:10.864 --> 17:13.825
Ah, dang it, today's
Teresa's quinceañera?

17:13.867 --> 17:15.827
Juarez has been talking
about that for months.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.862
I bet they're tearing
the roof off that rec hall.

17:17.904 --> 17:20.263
I can't believe we came all
this way only to be stopped

17:20.306 --> 17:21.499
by a beautiful rite of passage.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.934
We're not.

17:22.976 --> 17:24.702
We're going to that quinceañera!

17:24.743 --> 17:26.170
I'm not dressed for that!

17:26.212 --> 17:27.672
LINDA:
Did you lock all the doors?

17:27.714 --> 17:29.941
Yes, there were so many,
but they're locked.

17:29.983 --> 17:31.309
It started raining out there.

17:31.351 --> 17:32.643
And it's getting dark.

17:32.685 --> 17:34.612
I hope the guns are okay.
All right,

17:34.654 --> 17:36.014
who's hungry?

17:36.056 --> 17:37.448
(all cheer)
All right, all right, calm down.

17:37.490 --> 17:41.285
Mm. This feels so wrong
but tastes so right.

17:41.327 --> 17:44.022
Would anyone mind if
I smoked between courses?

17:44.064 --> 17:45.289
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

17:45.331 --> 17:46.991
Oh, now I get that.

17:47.033 --> 17:49.994
There's only one course left,
and we all know what it is.

17:50.036 --> 17:53.131
(squeals) Mrs. Winthorpe's
seven-layer parfait.

17:53.173 --> 17:55.233
Now let's flambè that sucker.

17:55.275 --> 17:56.801
NANCY: Drop that match!

17:56.843 --> 17:58.369
Uh... (stammers)

17:58.411 --> 17:59.804
blow it out and then drop
it, or just drop it?

17:59.846 --> 18:00.972
I'm-I'm gonna blow it out first.

18:01.014 --> 18:03.081
Marshall! (Whispers): Sorry.

18:06.351 --> 18:08.679
How'd you even get in?
The doors were all locked.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.048
Not the aviary.

18:10.090 --> 18:11.382
Damn it, Charlene.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.917
There were so many doors.

18:12.959 --> 18:14.252
Wow, you guys made good time.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.920
Where the hell'd you
get that pocket watch?

18:15.962 --> 18:17.755
Oh, I-it's on loan
from the estate.

18:17.797 --> 18:20.324
My character Oliver
uses it, so, yeah.

18:20.366 --> 18:22.326
That parfait is ours.

18:22.368 --> 18:25.329
We put up with your crap all
weekend; The parfait is ours.

18:25.371 --> 18:26.731
Eating our friggin'
seven-course meal

18:26.773 --> 18:27.999
wasn't enough?

18:28.041 --> 18:29.567
No, it wasn't!

18:29.609 --> 18:32.236
(grunts) What the hell has
gotten into you people?

18:32.278 --> 18:34.672
Oh, and mud is getting tracked
into the dining room!

18:34.714 --> 18:37.108
I can kiss that
cleaning deposit good-bye.

18:37.150 --> 18:39.077
LARPs aren't supposed
to have uprisings.

18:39.119 --> 18:40.344
He's right.

18:40.386 --> 18:43.181
Look, wait, stop, everyone.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.416
Yes, we did enjoy
the seven-course dinner,

18:45.458 --> 18:49.353
so maybe we can share the
parfait together, as equals.

18:49.395 --> 18:51.189
Equals? Ha!

18:51.231 --> 18:52.557
You silly, simple woman.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.058
Now clean me off and
feed me that parfait.

18:54.100 --> 18:55.860
Nancy,

18:55.902 --> 18:58.463
don't you remember what it was
like we before we came here?

18:58.505 --> 19:01.265
No! We've always been here.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.401
Oh, boy. Get that parfait!

19:03.443 --> 19:04.936
I tried! Come on, servants!

19:04.978 --> 19:06.704
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

19:06.746 --> 19:08.372
Off limits!
You're going off limits!

19:08.414 --> 19:10.074
LARP time-out. LARP time-out.

19:10.116 --> 19:12.710
(sighs) I'm guessing
you haven't been sleeping

19:12.752 --> 19:14.946
with a pillow between your
knees, like we talked about?

19:14.988 --> 19:16.981
Dr. Juarez, I always
appreciate your tips,

19:17.023 --> 19:19.283
and I know we're crashing
your beautiful quinceañera,

19:19.325 --> 19:21.152
but I just need you
to crack my back.

19:21.194 --> 19:23.287
Fine, fine. Relax and let go.

19:23.329 --> 19:24.555
(groaning)
You're not letting go.

19:24.597 --> 19:25.790
Teddy, relax.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.059
I need you to let go. (Exclaims)

19:28.101 --> 19:31.662
(bones crack, relieved sighing) There
we are. That's what I was looking for.

19:31.704 --> 19:33.297
And if you can just tap
your two toes together.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.899
Tap your big toes together.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.334
(exclaims)
(bones crack, Teddy yells)

19:36.376 --> 19:37.835
That's what I'm looking for.

19:37.877 --> 19:40.304
Teddy, can I try, can I try,
can I try?

19:40.346 --> 19:42.140
Not right now, Gene.
Maybe later.

19:42.182 --> 19:43.908
You did it, Doc.

19:43.950 --> 19:45.910
Oh, you sweet, sweet angel, Dr.
Juarez. Yes.

19:45.952 --> 19:47.345
Have you changed your
policy about kissing?

19:47.387 --> 19:48.980
Not yet, not yet.

19:49.022 --> 19:51.782
(pants) There's got to be
a place to gobble this up.

19:51.824 --> 19:53.818
The library. Quick, In there!

19:53.860 --> 19:56.027
Eh, you're not supposed to
go in the library. Bob!

19:58.997 --> 20:01.432
All right, Marshall,
let's heat it and eat it.

20:02.968 --> 20:04.595
Will you look at that. Whoa.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.697
Just like on the show.
(door rattles)

20:06.739 --> 20:08.633
Oh, you found us, huh?

20:08.675 --> 20:10.468
(groaning loudly)

20:10.510 --> 20:11.702
The door's locked.

20:11.744 --> 20:13.004
Enjoy the view.

20:13.046 --> 20:14.472
(growls)

20:14.514 --> 20:15.973
You'd better not.

20:16.015 --> 20:17.275
Watch me.

20:17.317 --> 20:18.676
Mmm.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.151
(grumbling)

20:22.888 --> 20:25.950
(distorted): That's my parfait!

20:25.992 --> 20:27.685
Oh, my God!

20:27.727 --> 20:28.786
(grunts)

20:28.828 --> 20:30.094
No!

20:33.365 --> 20:34.665
(all yelling and eating)

20:37.069 --> 20:38.462
MR. PERKINS: That's it!

20:38.504 --> 20:40.364
You're all kicked out!

20:40.406 --> 20:43.367
(engine sputtering softly)

20:43.409 --> 20:45.203
So... good LARP?

20:45.245 --> 20:46.504
I loved it.

20:46.546 --> 20:48.172
LINDA: <i> You know,</i>

20:48.214 --> 20:50.141
I think we put
that era on a pedestal

20:50.183 --> 20:51.375
maybe a little too much.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.244
Life was horrible back then

20:53.286 --> 20:55.179
if you weren't
in the super-upper class.

20:55.221 --> 20:59.016
I'm just glad that we live in a
time where there are no classes.

20:59.058 --> 21:00.918
I-I get what you were going for.

21:00.960 --> 21:04.055
Unrelated, we may have left the
bathroom door at the rec hall.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.389
Wait, what?

21:05.431 --> 21:06.891
But it's probably happier there.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.759
Yeah, what kind of life
was it living here?

21:08.801 --> 21:10.661
I mean, if that door could talk.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.396
It'd better keep
its damn mouth shut!

21:12.438 --> 21:15.233
So, who wants to watch
<i>Winthorpe Manor?</i>
