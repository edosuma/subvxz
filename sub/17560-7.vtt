11:53.170 --> 11:54.463
Oh, okay everybody

11:54.547 --> 11:56.674
give it up
for Danielle Delay.

11:56.757 --> 11:58.300
It's Danielle Johnson.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.468
We'll see.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.931
Trick or treat?

12:04.014 --> 12:06.600
You dropped out of college?

12:06.684 --> 12:08.269
All out of candy, little girl.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.030
What do you know about
managing a musician?

12:20.114 --> 12:22.158
It takes you an hour to get
the plastic off a CD.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.493
Val, I swear.
I'm really good at this.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.413
Danielle has an amazing voice
and I'm the one who told her.

12:27.496 --> 12:29.832
Yeah, telling people they can
sing is not a career.

12:29.915 --> 12:31.834
Yeah, it's a great career
when you have taste

12:31.917 --> 12:33.544
and you know what kinda
music's gonna hit.

12:33.627 --> 12:35.254
Do you know
who Clive Davis is?

12:35.337 --> 12:36.881
Is he the little friend
that talked you into this?

12:36.964 --> 12:38.591
'Cause I'll kick his ass.

12:38.674 --> 12:41.594
Now, you listen to me, you are
going back to college on Monday.

12:41.677 --> 12:44.930
No, I make my own decisions and
I'm not going back to college.

12:45.014 --> 12:47.183
Okay, you know what?
I make my own decisions

12:47.266 --> 12:48.934
and I'm not gonna keep
paying your way.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.519
You don't have to pay my way.

12:50.603 --> 12:54.273
I know it in my gut that
I can make a living at this.

12:54.356 --> 12:56.484
Oh really?
Okay, fine.

12:56.567 --> 12:57.902
You know what?
We'll just be roommates.

12:57.985 --> 13:00.237
Two gals living in the big city,
sharing a loft

13:00.321 --> 13:02.114
sharing the bills,
uh, rent, water

13:02.198 --> 13:03.991
electricity all of which
are due by Friday.

13:04.074 --> 13:05.117
Think you can handle
that for me?

13:05.201 --> 13:06.535
Oh, I know I can.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.287
In fact, I'm so sure that
if I can't get Danielle

13:08.370 --> 13:10.748
a recording contract
and cover those so called bills

13:10.831 --> 13:13.667
which I'll need to see some
documentation on by the way

13:13.751 --> 13:17.755
then I'll march myself back
to NYU and re-enroll myself.

13:17.838 --> 13:20.049

13:20.132 --> 13:22.218

You said it ten times already.

14:37.334 --> 14:38.794
Alright, well, I'm not
going to say it again

14:38.877 --> 14:40.963
because I'm leaving
for the club.

14:41.046 --> 14:42.381
Okay.

14:46.468 --> 14:48.554
Are you seriously not
gonna go to the club

14:48.637 --> 14:50.764
and see if your sister
pulls this off.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.308
Very cold, Val Tyler.

14:52.391 --> 14:55.394
That's because Holly hasn't
let me turn heat on all week.

14:55.477 --> 14:57.855
Okay, fine. You know what?
Do what you want.

14:57.938 --> 15:01.108
All I'm sayin' is
I'm goin' to the club.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.360
Okay.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.906
Alright.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.492
I'm just saying that Holly
came by today and told me

15:10.576 --> 15:13.203
that you have been there for
every big moment in her life

15:13.287 --> 15:15.539
and she couldn't believe you
were gonna miss this one.

15:16.582 --> 15:17.708
She said that?

15:17.791 --> 15:19.209
Well, actually she came
by to make sure

15:19.293 --> 15:21.045
I didn't have any
unnecessary lights on

15:21.128 --> 15:24.089
but...I read
between the lines.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.382
Okay.

15:25.466 --> 15:26.800
Gotta go.

15:26.884 --> 15:28.093
Goin' to the club.

15:29.553 --> 15:30.763
Goodbye, Lauren.

15:34.141 --> 15:37.144
You know, you were a lot more
fun when you were nude.

15:46.945 --> 15:49.239
Wow, this place is packed!

15:49.323 --> 15:51.700
Holly got a much bigger crowd
here for Danielle

15:51.784 --> 15:54.703
than she usually gets for you.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.622
I'm just sayin'.

15:56.705 --> 15:59.416
Yeah, well, it's, uh, not the
size that matters, you know.

15:59.500 --> 16:02.878
Yeah. You just keep tellin'
yourself that.

16:05.130 --> 16:06.840
Oh, my God!
Look how crowded it is!

16:06.924 --> 16:09.843
I know. Who knew so many people
liked free buffalo wings!

16:09.927 --> 16:11.428
Uh, I don't think I can
do this, Holly.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.430
What are you talking about?
You have to.

16:13.514 --> 16:16.433
Do you know what I gave up
for this? College.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.560
You quit before you
even knew about me.

16:18.644 --> 16:21.480
Okay, F-Y-I, nobody likes
to start with a brain.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.444
Oh, my damn!
Oh, my damn! Oh, my damn!

16:27.528 --> 16:30.489
A producer from Arcadia Records
is sitting right here.

16:30.572 --> 16:32.282
He must have gotten one of
those tapes you sent out.

16:32.366 --> 16:34.201
Do you know how
important this is?

16:34.284 --> 16:35.369
I mean this is the man
that's gonna make

16:35.452 --> 16:36.745
or break your career, girl.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.082
I mean, good luck, baby.

16:40.165 --> 16:42.459
This is wonderful. It's exactly
what we've been waiting for.

16:42.543 --> 16:46.046
You're gonna be great.
Okay, I'm gonna go schmooze.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.257
Listen to me! "Schmooze!"

16:48.340 --> 16:51.760
Okay, go out there
and make love to the people.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.846
How do you do?
I'm people.

16:57.307 --> 17:01.770

18:28.982 --> 18:30.692
You can't be in here.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.070
- What's wrong?
- Forget it.

18:33.153 --> 18:34.738
You can't get Danielle
a record deal?

18:34.822 --> 18:37.533
No. Actually, looks like
she is getting one.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.535
Arcadia records is gonna make
her an offer.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.036
And they're really big.

18:41.119 --> 18:44.039
So big that they have
their own management company.

18:44.122 --> 18:45.457
And what does that mean?

18:45.541 --> 18:47.334
It means that Danielle's
gonna sign with them

18:47.417 --> 18:48.919
and I got nothing.

18:49.002 --> 18:51.547
This whole thing
was stupid anyway.

18:51.630 --> 18:54.174
Stupid? Hey!

18:54.258 --> 18:56.134
What happened to
the girl who knows

18:56.218 --> 18:58.011
in her gut that this is
what she should be doing?

18:58.095 --> 19:01.056
The girl who, I've gotta say,
I've never seen work harder

19:01.139 --> 19:03.058
on anything in her whole life.

19:03.141 --> 19:05.769
That girl's going back
to college on Monday.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.271
That was the deal.

19:07.354 --> 19:09.690
Well, maybe we should
rethink that.

19:09.773 --> 19:11.859
You mean, as in, Tuesday?

19:14.069 --> 19:17.281
You filled the club tonight.
You got record people here.

19:17.364 --> 19:19.449

Clint Davis.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.118

19:21.201 --> 19:24.371
I'm just saying,
look what you did in a week.

19:24.454 --> 19:26.331
Maybe it's not such
a bad idea for you to take

19:26.415 --> 19:29.334
the rest of the year off
and give this a shot.

19:29.418 --> 19:30.919
Are you serious?

19:31.003 --> 19:34.298
But...you love college.
College is your life.

19:34.381 --> 19:35.757
You'd marry college
if you could.
