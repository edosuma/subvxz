WEBVTT

00:00.400 --> 00:02.300
Sorry, who are you?
John.

00:02.575 --> 00:04.325
I was in school with Ifan.

00:04.650 --> 00:07.600
We're arresting you on suspicion
of the murder of Ifan Williams.

00:08.225 --> 00:10.350
We can't proceed
unless the claimant is present.

00:10.600 --> 00:13.150
I asked them
to reschedule the meeting.

00:13.425 --> 00:16.425
He forgot to vaccinate the herd,
that's all.

00:16.550 --> 00:21.300
It was stressful for us all
and money was tight.

00:21.575 --> 00:24.725
Hang on! I'm short.
You've been late time after time.

00:25.375 --> 00:27.375
You applied for a job
without telling me.

00:27.625 --> 00:31.675
I don't see how this changes things.
Things have already changed.

02:23.750 --> 02:27.400
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

03:15.275 --> 03:19.525
I appreciate that but I'm not going
to be able to make it this month.

03:19.650 --> 03:21.350
I'm late getting paid.

03:25.325 --> 03:27.725
Come on! There must be something
you can do.

03:28.225 --> 03:30.600
I've been with you for years.
Always paid.

03:32.575 --> 03:34.625
I'm just asking for a few weeks.

03:38.175 --> 03:39.750
Thanks for fucking nothing.

03:43.225 --> 03:44.225
Sion?

03:48.150 --> 03:51.525
If you want a lift to work,
I'm leaving in five minutes.

03:54.600 --> 03:59.225
(FATHER McEWAN) Remember that
your compassion, O Lord...

03:59.350 --> 04:02.175
..and your kindness are from of old.

04:02.500 --> 04:06.325
Remember not the sins of my youth
nor my transgressions.

04:06.450 --> 04:11.275
According to thy mercy
remember thou me...

04:11.650 --> 04:14.400
..for thy goodness' sake, o Lord.

04:14.525 --> 04:17.700
(CONGREGATION)
Teach me your ways, O Lord.

04:21.325 --> 04:24.575
Good and upright is the Lord.

04:24.700 --> 04:29.525
Therefore will he teach sinners
in the way.

04:31.550 --> 04:39.550
The meek will he guide in judgment
and the meek will he teach his way.

04:39.675 --> 04:44.600
(CONGREGATION)
Teach me your ways, O Lord.

04:46.350 --> 04:47.350
Allelujah!

04:47.475 --> 04:49.425
(CONGREGATION) Allelujah!

04:52.250 --> 04:54.450
Surely, it doesn't take that long?

04:56.150 --> 04:58.150
Yes, I understand that but...

04:58.725 --> 05:02.575
OK, as soon as the results are in,
send them through to me.

05:04.200 --> 05:05.525
DCI Cadi John.

05:06.425 --> 05:08.275
My e-mail's on the system.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.325
Forensics.

05:12.275 --> 05:15.350
It's still early.
They're probably not in yet.

05:20.575 --> 05:23.475
I've been going through
those LIO reports.

05:23.600 --> 05:27.325
Ifan Williams was arrested
for underage driving.

05:27.625 --> 05:29.425
I want to go up to the farm.

05:31.650 --> 05:32.650
Come on then!

05:33.275 --> 05:36.175
Have I got time for a coffee?
No!

06:17.675 --> 06:19.400
KNOCK ON DOOR

06:23.700 --> 06:24.700
Good morning.

06:28.400 --> 06:29.400
Come in.

06:36.625 --> 06:38.500
Is it him? The Polish man?

06:40.300 --> 06:43.275
If you mean Piotr Korecki...

06:43.400 --> 06:47.575
..he's still in custody
but our investigations are ongoing.

06:48.275 --> 06:50.275
I've been trying to remember.

06:50.400 --> 06:51.425
Last summer...

06:51.550 --> 06:54.375
..Ifan had a few men
working on the farm.

06:55.425 --> 06:56.675
But...

06:57.500 --> 06:59.625
..I don't recognise the name.

06:59.750 --> 07:02.475
Ifan never mentioned him.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.200
What was Ifan like?

07:04.500 --> 07:06.650
I don't understand what you mean.

07:08.200 --> 07:11.575
We're trying to understand more
about Ifan's life...

07:12.250 --> 07:15.650
..and it would help us
to get a sense of who he was.

07:17.525 --> 07:19.700
How do you describe your own son?

07:20.200 --> 07:21.375
It's impossible.

07:23.300 --> 07:25.350
Were he and his father similar?

07:25.750 --> 07:26.750
No...!

07:28.250 --> 07:29.250
No.

07:32.350 --> 07:36.350
We saw that Ifan was arrested
for underage driving.

07:36.625 --> 07:37.750
That was nothing.

07:38.250 --> 07:41.325
John and Ifan
were just driving the Land Rover.

07:42.250 --> 07:43.250
John?

07:43.375 --> 07:44.550
John Lloyd.

07:45.475 --> 07:46.500
Ifan's friend.

07:47.675 --> 07:50.250
Farmers' sons have to help.

07:50.675 --> 07:53.575
They use machinery. They drive.

07:53.700 --> 07:57.175
No-one gets charged for it.
It's just the way it is.

08:01.200 --> 08:04.200
After your husband passed away...

08:04.725 --> 08:08.250
..there were a few problems
on the farm.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.250
Ifan was handling it.

08:12.550 --> 08:14.175
Was he?

08:15.450 --> 08:16.500
Yes.

08:17.650 --> 08:22.225
The key to working
somewhere like this...

08:22.350 --> 08:24.600
..to living somewhere like this...

08:24.725 --> 08:28.375
..is learning which battles
are worth fighting...

08:28.500 --> 08:31.275
..and which are better left alone.

08:32.250 --> 08:35.350
Learning when to bite your tongue.

08:36.525 --> 08:39.750
You phoned DEFRA, didn't you?

08:41.375 --> 08:44.475
As you said,
there were standards to be kept.

08:46.725 --> 08:50.550
You couldn't bite your tongue
any more...

08:51.375 --> 08:54.600
..so you made
an anonymous complaint, didn't you?

08:54.725 --> 08:56.550
And what if I did?

08:59.275 --> 09:01.400
What choice did I have?

09:02.725 --> 09:05.750
It was like watching Dai
disappearing again.

09:06.550 --> 09:08.525
I did everything I could...

09:08.650 --> 09:11.625
..everything in my power
to help Ifan...

09:13.150 --> 09:15.475
..but the stock was suffering...

09:16.500 --> 09:19.225
..and he was doing nothing about it.

09:21.650 --> 09:23.600
What choice did I have?

09:48.300 --> 09:50.675
Always thought
he was the dog's bollocks.

09:51.175 --> 09:54.600
Yeah but would he go that far?
You don't know his story, do you?

09:54.725 --> 09:58.375
They let them into the country
and fuck knows where they're from.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.400
What are you talking about?

10:01.150 --> 10:02.525
What's your problem?

10:03.175 --> 10:06.175
People talking shit about
things they know nothing about.

10:06.450 --> 10:07.475
Sion, leave it.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.675
You and Polish boy
are best mates now?

10:11.175 --> 10:14.500
Last time I checked,
you were eyeballing each other.

10:14.625 --> 10:17.700
If you ask me,
they should string the fucker up.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.200
Hey! Hey!

10:21.225 --> 10:23.375
Fuck! Think you're a big man?

10:23.650 --> 10:25.750
You're fuck all, mate. Fuck all!

10:26.250 --> 10:27.250
Sion!

10:27.700 --> 10:28.700
Oy!

10:29.350 --> 10:31.425
What the fuck's going on here?
Nothing, boss.

10:31.550 --> 10:34.250
I'm sick of this shit.

10:34.575 --> 10:36.225
You, get back to work!

10:36.350 --> 10:38.350
You, go and fucking cool off.

10:38.675 --> 10:41.575
He started...
I don't want to fucking hear it.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.175
I said go... now!

10:57.450 --> 10:59.475
That stuff'll kill you.

11:00.450 --> 11:02.300
Says you!

11:06.375 --> 11:09.625
I usually get a sense
of who they were.

11:10.600 --> 11:11.600
The victims.

11:11.725 --> 11:14.300
It's like nobody really knew Ifan.

11:14.425 --> 11:15.450
His wife.

11:15.575 --> 11:18.500
Even his mother thought
he was someone he wasn't.

11:19.225 --> 11:21.275
Maybe he didn't know who he was.

11:21.400 --> 11:24.525
There must've been someone
who was close to him.

11:24.650 --> 11:28.725
Someone he didn't cross.
His mate - John Lloyd?

11:29.450 --> 11:31.650
Mm. It's worth having a chat to him.

11:34.625 --> 11:37.600
Friendships usually end
for a reason.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.450
Vaughan...

11:47.275 --> 11:50.150
..I need to tell you something.

11:50.675 --> 11:52.525
That doesn't sound great.

11:54.625 --> 11:57.175
I've been offered a job.

11:58.150 --> 12:00.225
Detective Super.

12:00.575 --> 12:02.150
At Merseyside.

12:04.375 --> 12:06.575
They want me to start immediately.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.375
That's amazing.

12:15.550 --> 12:17.175
It really is.

12:18.250 --> 12:20.450
I'm so pleased for you, Cadi.

12:25.225 --> 12:27.325
I'll bloody miss you though.

12:27.625 --> 12:30.750
Who's going to nag me
about my eating habits?

12:36.400 --> 12:38.500
Why am I sensing there's a hitch?

12:39.250 --> 12:40.500
There's no hitch.

12:42.350 --> 12:43.350
Not really.

12:45.500 --> 12:49.450
I've made a complete mess of things
with Rachel...

12:49.575 --> 12:52.225
..and I don't know how to fix it.

12:53.425 --> 12:55.625
She's not on board with this?

12:57.575 --> 13:00.625
I didn't give her a chance
to get on board...

13:02.425 --> 13:04.425
..and now it's too late.

13:07.425 --> 13:10.400
I may not be the best person
to offer advice...

13:10.675 --> 13:11.675
..but...

13:14.375 --> 13:16.425
..don't give up on her, Cadi.

13:16.725 --> 13:18.625
If it's what you want.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.750
If the past year's
taught me anything...

13:24.575 --> 13:26.325
..it's that.

13:34.450 --> 13:36.400
But nobody told me anything.

13:36.525 --> 13:40.175
I've sent several letters
over the past few months.

13:40.300 --> 13:41.425
I didn't see them.

13:43.150 --> 13:45.450
They were sent to your address.

13:47.175 --> 13:51.250
I can't give you anything on account
until the bill's been paid.

13:51.375 --> 13:53.175
But I need the feed today.

13:53.300 --> 13:56.175
I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do.

13:56.475 --> 13:58.525
The animals can't just wait...!

14:00.675 --> 14:02.375
What if I give you cash?

14:02.500 --> 14:03.700
Would that work?

14:07.725 --> 14:10.200
Look, pay me for what you need now.

14:10.325 --> 14:14.450
I'll give you until the end of
next week to settle the rest, OK?

14:15.500 --> 14:16.625
I'll get it to you.

14:18.700 --> 14:23.625
Glyn, can you carry a sack of feed
out to Mrs Williams's car, please?

14:25.675 --> 14:27.175
Thank you.

14:49.475 --> 14:50.475
I'm sorry.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.700
About what?
About your husband.

14:57.600 --> 15:00.575
My mum died too
and I was sad for a long time...

15:00.700 --> 15:02.300
..but I'm better now.

15:05.250 --> 15:06.500
Thank you.

15:18.625 --> 15:20.625
ENGINE STARTS

15:37.375 --> 15:38.600
Is it safe to come in?

15:38.725 --> 15:41.550
They should've burned all of this.

15:42.300 --> 15:43.650
These medical notes.

15:44.150 --> 15:45.450
Shown some respect.

15:48.300 --> 15:51.575
These are people's lives.
People's details.

15:51.700 --> 15:54.750
Nobody will see them.
That's not the point.

15:58.525 --> 16:03.375
The only people who keep track
of you from birth to death...

16:03.500 --> 16:05.650
..are doctors and priests.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.350
It's only paper.
No, it isn't.

16:09.650 --> 16:11.300
It's people's trust.

16:12.650 --> 16:14.550
It's people's confidence.

16:14.675 --> 16:17.600
It's not just papers,
it's people's lives.

16:18.650 --> 16:19.650
You know...

16:20.250 --> 16:22.425
..you play by the rules...

16:23.175 --> 16:26.150
..and you expect things
to get better.

16:28.450 --> 16:32.150
You think that one day
you'll be seen.

16:32.650 --> 16:34.400
You'll feel valued.

16:34.525 --> 16:35.525
Sion, mate...

16:35.650 --> 16:39.750
You think if you stand in the queue
long enough you'll get to the front.

16:40.425 --> 16:42.475
It doesn't work like that.

16:44.500 --> 16:48.250
We're just pieces of paper
that people have walked on.

16:49.150 --> 16:50.425
Filed...

16:50.750 --> 16:52.625
..and forgotten.

16:54.200 --> 16:55.450
Left behind.

17:04.150 --> 17:06.150
GLASS BOTTLES CLINKING

17:11.725 --> 17:13.725
DOOR CLOSES

17:28.425 --> 17:30.425
I'll make us a coffee, shall I?

17:33.375 --> 17:37.325
The Housing Association appointment
is at twelve thirty.

17:37.450 --> 17:39.250
Maybe you can take a shower?

17:40.400 --> 17:42.700
Let's not miss it this time, eh?

18:01.450 --> 18:03.700
I need you to find
a John Lloyd for me.

18:04.200 --> 18:08.175
He was in the same school year
as Ifan Williams.

18:08.475 --> 18:10.475
SHE TAPS ON THE GLASS

18:16.700 --> 18:18.400
How are you getting on?

18:19.475 --> 18:21.575
We spoke to Ifan's mother today.

18:21.700 --> 18:26.525
She called in the animal abuse.
She shopped her own son?

18:26.650 --> 18:27.650
Mm.

18:28.650 --> 18:30.700
It can't have been easy for her.

18:31.400 --> 18:33.400
It was a desperate measure...

18:33.525 --> 18:37.375
..to try to protect whatever legacy
was left on the farm.

18:37.500 --> 18:38.675
Other than that...

18:39.750 --> 18:42.225
..there's a former farm worker.

18:42.350 --> 18:44.150
Discarded by Ifan.

18:46.475 --> 18:48.550
A pattern of behaviour, you think?
Maybe.

18:48.675 --> 18:50.325
KNOCK ON DOOR

18:50.700 --> 18:52.650
Forensics came back at last.

18:53.625 --> 18:55.275
Piotr is clean.

18:59.350 --> 19:01.350
At least we can eliminate him.

19:02.300 --> 19:04.350
Where does that leave us?

19:06.450 --> 19:08.150
We need to start again.

19:12.150 --> 19:13.575
We've missed something.

19:13.700 --> 19:17.600
There's something about that family,
his upbringing...

19:17.725 --> 19:20.175
..that just doesn't sit right.

19:21.375 --> 19:23.500
SHE TAPS ON THE CALCULATOR KEYS

19:25.150 --> 19:27.150
DOOR CLOSES

19:30.600 --> 19:33.150
What did they want this morning?

19:37.300 --> 19:40.550
The police. What did they want?
Nothing.

19:41.675 --> 19:44.600
When were you going to tell me?
Tell you what?

19:44.725 --> 19:48.225
I just had a call from the valuers.

19:48.750 --> 19:52.300
They had no right to call you.
He's an old friend.

19:52.600 --> 19:56.600
Of course he'll contact me
when you ask him to value the land.

19:56.725 --> 20:00.400
When you ask him to sell it
from under us.

20:00.525 --> 20:01.650
We have no choice.

20:02.525 --> 20:07.175
Selling something you've only
had your hands on for a few years.

20:07.300 --> 20:10.325
We have no choice.
Selling Guto's future.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.350
We have no choice!

20:16.425 --> 20:20.225
Do you have any idea
how much debt we're in?

20:20.675 --> 20:24.575
Do you have any idea how far down
Ifan ground this place?

20:25.300 --> 20:28.625
Farms are always in and out of debt.
Not like this!

20:33.575 --> 20:36.450
Why won't you see
what's right in front of your eyes?

20:38.300 --> 20:39.750
And now that he's gone...

20:40.525 --> 20:42.525
..the debt's in my name.

20:43.375 --> 20:45.575
If we sell now, we'll have nothing.

20:46.700 --> 20:48.325
And I mean nothing.

20:49.475 --> 20:53.300
We'll clear the debts
and we'll be back at the beginning.

20:55.625 --> 20:57.650
This is what he left us with.

21:01.550 --> 21:02.625
All those years.

21:03.575 --> 21:05.200
Generations.

21:06.725 --> 21:07.725
For what?

21:09.175 --> 21:11.200
I went to the feed place today.

21:12.275 --> 21:14.225
They've closed our account.

21:14.350 --> 21:16.750
I had to pay cash
in front of everyone.

21:18.200 --> 21:19.425
Nobody trusted him.

21:20.275 --> 21:23.200
Because of that, nobody trusts us.
Of course they do.

21:23.475 --> 21:25.475
Mair! Nobody trusts us.

21:31.425 --> 21:33.175
I've got to pick Guto up.

21:35.475 --> 21:37.425
I'm sorry, Mair. I really am.

21:38.550 --> 21:40.450
I can't do this any more.

21:51.650 --> 21:53.650
DOOR CLOSES

22:16.350 --> 22:18.425
Thomas, a word please.

22:33.675 --> 22:36.225
That's you paid
till the end of the day.

22:36.500 --> 22:37.675
Take it and go.

22:39.700 --> 22:42.550
You're sacking me?
Looks like it.

22:43.200 --> 22:46.200
What the fuck did you expect?
I need this job.

22:46.325 --> 22:49.450
I haven't got time
to deal with wasters like you.

22:49.725 --> 22:53.575
I checked the timesheet.
You were late every other morning.

22:54.225 --> 22:56.250
I'm the breadwinner in our house.

22:56.525 --> 23:00.175
Should've thought of that
before throwing your weight around.

23:00.300 --> 23:01.375
There's no work about.

23:01.500 --> 23:05.375
Please help me out.
I warned you. Get your stuff and go.

23:30.300 --> 23:32.300
SHE SIGHS

23:33.175 --> 23:34.175
What is it?

23:35.625 --> 23:39.625
There were a few boys
causing trouble a few years back.

23:40.400 --> 23:42.500
John's name comes up quite a lot.

23:42.625 --> 23:45.225
Poaching, theft...

23:45.650 --> 23:48.325
..starting fires in the woods.

23:49.275 --> 23:52.700
Relatively low-grade stuff
but there's a pattern.

23:53.200 --> 23:54.425
Any mention of Ifan?

23:54.550 --> 23:57.625
None, other than
in relation to driving.

23:58.725 --> 24:03.350
From what we know, it'd be typical
of him to fly under the radar.

24:03.475 --> 24:04.525
I don't know.

24:05.175 --> 24:09.525
It's like he never had to face up to
the consequences of his actions.

24:10.175 --> 24:12.225
I found an address for John Lloyd.

24:12.500 --> 24:15.450
He works at a forestry commission
20 miles away.

24:15.575 --> 24:18.725
His wife says he's on shift now.
Great. Thanks, Gwawr.

24:20.300 --> 24:22.725
Shall we pay him a visit?
That's the plan.

24:27.550 --> 24:30.325
As you can see...

24:30.600 --> 24:32.700
..from her case worker report...

24:33.200 --> 24:35.600
..she's been
following the programme.

24:35.725 --> 24:37.675
The house is in good order...

24:38.175 --> 24:41.425
..and she's carried out
some improvements herself.

24:41.700 --> 24:43.550
Thank you, Father McEwan.

24:45.625 --> 24:48.525
The thing is,
as you're well aware...

24:49.175 --> 24:52.675
..demand for these houses
far outstrips supply.

24:53.175 --> 24:57.725
We have to justify providing such a
large property for single occupancy.

24:58.225 --> 24:59.500
It's her family home.

25:00.175 --> 25:01.500
Yes but we're aware...

25:02.250 --> 25:06.300
..that Mr Price is not currently
residing at the property...

25:07.400 --> 25:12.400
..and that's unlikely to change
in the short to medium term.

25:14.550 --> 25:15.625
Is that correct?

25:17.550 --> 25:20.525
Dad's still in prison,
if that's what you mean?

25:21.175 --> 25:24.625
Stability. That's what Lea needs
at the moment.

25:25.275 --> 25:26.700
She's been through a lot.

25:27.200 --> 25:30.275
I'm aware of that
but Lea's no longer a minor...

25:31.525 --> 25:35.725
..and, as a single person,
she could easily be accommodated...

25:36.600 --> 25:38.575
..in a smaller property.

25:39.425 --> 25:41.525
Somewhere closer to town perhaps.

25:43.150 --> 25:46.550
This is a family home.
Yes, it is a family home.

25:48.600 --> 25:50.250
It's my family home.

25:51.300 --> 25:54.500
I'm sorry to say
that's no longer true.

26:00.150 --> 26:02.150
DOOR SLAMS SHUT

26:06.425 --> 26:08.425
CAR ARRIVES

26:09.425 --> 26:11.425
CAR DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

26:12.450 --> 26:14.450
CAR DEPARTS

26:16.200 --> 26:19.525
FRONT DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

26:23.650 --> 26:25.200
You're home early.

26:29.525 --> 26:31.150
They fired me.

26:34.250 --> 26:35.250
I lost my job.

26:37.750 --> 26:40.650
It's OK. I'm still working.

26:42.750 --> 26:43.750
Sion?

26:44.400 --> 26:46.450
We've still got my wages.

26:47.625 --> 26:49.675
You really think that'll help?

26:50.175 --> 26:52.250
You don't have a fucking clue.

26:52.525 --> 26:55.175
Don't say that.
Don't treat me like a kid.

26:55.450 --> 26:58.425
I can ask them.
It's not even a proper job, Glyn!

26:58.700 --> 27:02.400
Mam said we stick together.
Have each other's backs.

27:02.525 --> 27:05.475
What the fuck does it matter
about Mam? She's dead!

27:05.600 --> 27:08.725
It's only you and me - ti a fi.
Can't you fucking see that?

27:19.350 --> 27:20.350
I'm sorry.

27:21.725 --> 27:22.725
Oh, God.

27:23.350 --> 27:26.350
I'm sorry, OK?
No.

27:26.475 --> 27:27.500
Leave me alone.

27:27.625 --> 27:29.650
Glyn, please.
Get off me!

27:49.425 --> 27:51.425
ANGUISHED SCREAMS

28:54.475 --> 28:56.475
INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION

29:04.200 --> 29:05.325
John Lloyd?

29:06.325 --> 29:09.550
I'm DCI Cadi John
and this is DS Owen Vaughan.

29:09.675 --> 29:11.725
Is there somewhere we can talk?

29:12.225 --> 29:13.300
We can talk here.

29:13.425 --> 29:16.600
It's not like there's anyone here
to listen in.

29:18.500 --> 29:19.500
OK.

29:19.625 --> 29:22.325
You were friends with Ifan Williams?

29:24.650 --> 29:25.650
So?

29:26.150 --> 29:28.150
You'd known him since school?

29:31.300 --> 29:32.475
What's this about?

29:34.450 --> 29:39.350
Just answer the question please.
Yes, I'd known him since school.

29:39.475 --> 29:40.550
And afterwards?

29:42.200 --> 29:43.375
On and off.

29:43.500 --> 29:45.400
What do you mean, on and off?

29:46.550 --> 29:47.550
I dunno.

29:48.600 --> 29:52.450
We hung out when we were younger
and then we didn't.

29:52.575 --> 29:55.175
What happened? Did you fall out?

29:56.275 --> 29:57.400
No.

29:58.525 --> 30:01.450
It was just one of those things.

30:02.275 --> 30:03.575
In my experience...

30:03.700 --> 30:06.700
..friendships
don't just self-combust.

30:07.375 --> 30:11.500
You were very close for a long time
according to Ifan's mother.

30:11.625 --> 30:13.400
Jesus, we were kids.

30:13.525 --> 30:15.325
What do you want me to say?

30:16.550 --> 30:17.550
We grew up.

30:17.675 --> 30:19.575
Ifan had his life to live...

30:19.700 --> 30:21.150
..and I had mine.

30:23.375 --> 30:24.500
No hard feelings.

30:26.675 --> 30:28.425
Ifan didn't give a shit.

30:28.550 --> 30:31.650
He'd give it to you straight.
No bullshit.

30:32.300 --> 30:33.525
That's a rare thing.

30:33.650 --> 30:38.175
Nobody's got the fucking guts
to say anything these days.

30:39.350 --> 30:43.400
Do you have any idea why anyone
would've wanted to hurt him?

30:43.675 --> 30:44.750
Sorry.

30:45.250 --> 30:46.700
Isn't that your job?

30:49.725 --> 30:53.575
Your name has come up
in our intelligence reports.

30:55.525 --> 30:59.225
Informal notes made about
some trouble you were in...

30:59.350 --> 31:01.150
..when you were younger.

31:01.600 --> 31:05.325
The important word there
was 'informal'.

31:06.250 --> 31:07.250
We were kids.

31:07.375 --> 31:10.500
There wasn't much to do
in the middle of nowhere.

31:10.625 --> 31:12.425
We had to make our own fun.

31:12.550 --> 31:14.600
It was quite a long list though.

31:14.725 --> 31:18.375
Antisocial behaviour.
Driving without a licence.

31:18.500 --> 31:19.500
Fighting.

31:19.625 --> 31:22.475
It must have felt good...

31:23.750 --> 31:26.150
..to be big fish in a small pond.

31:26.275 --> 31:29.225
Everybody feels like that
when they're young.

31:29.350 --> 31:33.675
Above the law?
We never crossed that line.

31:34.175 --> 31:36.525
No?
No.

31:37.450 --> 31:38.725
We didn't.

31:43.550 --> 31:45.250
Listen, I'm a busy man.

31:45.375 --> 31:49.450
Unless you have something important
to ask me, let me get on.

32:03.550 --> 32:04.550
Nice guy.

32:04.675 --> 32:08.400
People get the friends they deserve.
Ouch!

32:09.150 --> 32:13.225
I'll drop you home.
I've got to get to Elin's house.

32:13.500 --> 32:15.600
Rhydian's cooking.
Bet you can't wait!

32:21.375 --> 32:22.375
Good boy.

32:22.500 --> 32:24.550
We'll have to measure you soon.

32:24.675 --> 32:26.375
I'm sure you've grown.

32:27.525 --> 32:30.275
Go and play before bath time.

32:40.325 --> 32:42.500
Did he eat anything?
Mm.

32:43.600 --> 32:46.375
There's more there if you want it.

32:46.500 --> 32:48.300
No, I'm not hungry.

32:50.300 --> 32:51.300
Um...

32:52.175 --> 32:53.700
Will you sit, please?

33:04.550 --> 33:08.300
I've been thinking about
what you said earlier.

33:08.425 --> 33:11.200
You know how much
this place means to me.

33:11.325 --> 33:12.325
Yes, I know.

33:13.275 --> 33:15.375
Please... let me finish.

33:15.650 --> 33:18.675
I've never known anything else.
Not like you.

33:20.350 --> 33:23.575
I was only young when I married Dai.

33:25.600 --> 33:28.475
This place has been my world.

33:28.750 --> 33:30.375
Every field.

33:32.250 --> 33:33.500
But...

33:33.625 --> 33:36.575
..I wanted you to know...

33:36.700 --> 33:39.450
..that I was new here once too.

33:43.200 --> 33:45.275
I felt the loneliness.

33:48.425 --> 33:51.525
That feeling of being
on someone else's patch.

33:52.525 --> 33:55.675
What you've got to remember is
I'm a woman.

33:57.375 --> 34:00.675
I was a wife
just as much as I was a mother.

34:02.500 --> 34:05.575
You think my love for them
blinded me...

34:09.325 --> 34:11.225
..but I wasn't blind.

34:13.550 --> 34:16.325
I could see what Ifan was like.

34:19.450 --> 34:21.250
How he treated you.

34:22.275 --> 34:25.225
But you never stood up to him.

34:26.250 --> 34:29.375
There are different ways
to stand up to someone.

34:29.725 --> 34:32.725
I made the complaint
about the animals.

34:33.375 --> 34:35.150
What? It was you?!

34:38.475 --> 34:40.350
I did it in Dai's memory.

34:42.450 --> 34:45.575
Sometimes, you have to
do the right thing.

34:46.325 --> 34:49.300
We need to
do the right thing now.

34:52.175 --> 34:57.400
The only way we can keep this place
is by working together as a family.

34:59.350 --> 35:01.350
If we can't do that...

35:02.350 --> 35:05.475
..you should sell it.

35:06.325 --> 35:07.700
Sell it all.

35:10.325 --> 35:14.225
Make a future somewhere else
for him.

36:27.150 --> 36:28.300
Sion?

36:34.500 --> 36:35.500
Sion?

37:03.600 --> 37:07.425
Sorry I'm late.
It's fine. I'm glad you're here.

37:08.225 --> 37:10.450
Rhyds isn't as good a chef
as he thinks.

37:10.575 --> 37:14.600
He burnt the lot
so I've ordered a takeaway. Come in.

39:03.525 --> 39:05.750
HE TAPS LIGHTLY ON THE DOOR

39:09.300 --> 39:10.700
(FATHER McEWAN) Lea?

39:12.600 --> 39:14.550
I know you're in there.

39:18.350 --> 39:22.550
Today was just another
bump in the road...

39:27.400 --> 39:30.550
..and you've got yourself
over so many.

39:34.150 --> 39:36.500
I'm sorry things went
the way they did.

39:39.425 --> 39:40.575
I really am.

39:43.525 --> 39:45.250
But maybe...

39:47.300 --> 39:50.650
..you could also see it
as a new beginning.

39:51.275 --> 39:52.400
A fresh start.

39:52.700 --> 39:55.375
We can't see it at the time...

39:55.500 --> 40:01.200
..but sometimes, the most difficult
things that happen to us...

40:02.625 --> 40:04.575
..are the best things.

40:06.325 --> 40:08.525
They can force us to change.

40:08.650 --> 40:11.200
To change the way we think.

40:16.600 --> 40:18.275
Anyway.

40:19.400 --> 40:23.675
I just wanted you to know
you're not alone.

40:26.400 --> 40:27.400
I'll go now.

40:28.650 --> 40:30.250
Goodnight, Lea.

40:38.600 --> 40:40.475
(WHISPERS) Goodnight.

40:54.675 --> 40:56.675
HAPPY CHATTER

41:05.175 --> 41:06.175
You OK?

41:07.275 --> 41:09.225
I'm going in to work for a bit.

41:09.350 --> 41:10.375
Now?!

41:11.500 --> 41:13.675
Are you sure? What about the food?

41:14.700 --> 41:16.325
I need it, Els.

41:16.450 --> 41:19.625
I can't just sit here,
thinking about things.

41:21.200 --> 41:22.575
CADI SIGHS

41:22.700 --> 41:26.175
I'll leave the key
under the mat for you.

42:44.375 --> 42:46.450
TAKES A DEEP BREATH

44:24.500 --> 44:27.450
I've been sat here...
Jesus Christ! Who...?

44:27.575 --> 44:29.675
I've been sat here thinking...
Sion, is that you?

44:30.175 --> 44:33.600
How did you get in here?
Shut up and let me speak!

44:37.375 --> 44:42.650
I've been sat here thinking
how a priest...

44:45.550 --> 44:47.250
..a man of God...

44:47.750 --> 44:51.350
..could let someone
he says he cares about suffer?

44:51.475 --> 44:52.525
Sion...

44:54.225 --> 44:55.475
You knew.

44:58.250 --> 44:59.750
All those years...

45:01.600 --> 45:03.225
..you knew.

45:05.250 --> 45:06.500
The agony.

45:06.625 --> 45:10.250
The not knowing
that was tearing me apart.

45:13.350 --> 45:16.150
You let me believe
it was an accident.

45:18.150 --> 45:20.250
I've had to live with that.

45:21.425 --> 45:24.250
I was newly ordained.

45:25.625 --> 45:27.250
I was young.

45:28.725 --> 45:31.750
Everyone said
how good you were to us...

45:36.150 --> 45:38.525
..but it was guilt, wasn't it?

45:40.425 --> 45:43.325
The truth was too much to ask for.

45:44.225 --> 45:45.225
Sion...

45:46.625 --> 45:48.575
..I did nothing wrong.

45:49.225 --> 45:50.225
What?

45:50.350 --> 45:52.550
Is that how you've lived with this?

45:53.200 --> 45:54.450
I took vows.

45:56.525 --> 45:59.300
The seal of confession is sacred.

46:01.350 --> 46:02.600
Who was it?

46:04.300 --> 46:05.300
Who told you?

46:07.625 --> 46:09.325
I said who was it?

46:10.425 --> 46:12.675
Who else knew?
You've got to tell me!

46:15.525 --> 46:17.150
Did you kill Ifan?

46:20.725 --> 46:22.750
An eye for an eye.

46:25.550 --> 46:27.425
Isn't that what they say?

46:29.325 --> 46:30.700
You've got to tell them.

46:31.600 --> 46:33.225
Confess?

46:33.350 --> 46:35.350
They'll find a way to help you.

46:36.650 --> 46:38.275
Like you did?!

46:39.225 --> 46:40.225
Sion.

46:42.275 --> 46:43.275
Don't do this.

46:43.525 --> 46:46.300
Branwen wouldn't have wanted this.

46:46.675 --> 46:49.200
Don't you dare say her name!

46:50.675 --> 46:54.675
You gave up the right to speak for
her when you protected her killer.

46:58.500 --> 47:00.300
You've got your revenge.

47:01.550 --> 47:04.400
Revenge isn't justice.

47:07.175 --> 47:09.325
Truth is justice.

47:11.625 --> 47:13.525
Tell me who else knew.

47:16.275 --> 47:17.550
You owe me.

47:18.175 --> 47:20.275
You fucking owe me that!

47:21.625 --> 47:26.350
I cannot and I will not tell you.
