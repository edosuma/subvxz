Previously on "The Fix"...

00:01.952 --> 00:04.147
Maya Travis, will you marry me?

00:04.171 --> 00:06.024
I'm not hearing a yes.

00:06.048 --> 00:08.526
- I have to protect this family.
- What is it?

00:08.550 --> 00:10.377
Papers making me a controlling partner

00:10.401 --> 00:11.896
- in your trust.
- What?

00:14.456 --> 00:16.434
He almost died because of you.

00:16.458 --> 00:19.118
All you are to my husband
is political cover.

00:19.142 --> 00:20.138
That's a shadow.

00:20.162 --> 00:22.040
Somebody else was in the storage unit

00:22.064 --> 00:23.942
when Jessica made these tapes.

00:23.966 --> 00:25.443
She was gonna kill me.

00:25.467 --> 00:27.845
Training at a gun range
like a bloody assassin.

00:27.869 --> 00:29.647
You actually might be innocent.

00:29.671 --> 00:31.049
My dad tried to warn me,

00:31.073 --> 00:32.417
and I should have listened.

00:32.441 --> 00:34.585
Wait. I need to say his name.

00:34.609 --> 00:36.477
Let's start over.

01:28.764 --> 01:30.274
Daddy!

01:30.298 --> 01:31.609
Wake up.

01:31.633 --> 01:32.744
I need pancakes.

01:32.768 --> 01:35.079
Okay, baby. I'll be right there.

01:35.103 --> 01:36.547
Oh.

01:39.341 --> 01:40.685
Can I have more syrup?

01:40.709 --> 01:42.520
Hmm.

01:42.544 --> 01:44.655
"May I have more syrup?"

01:44.679 --> 01:46.024
May I have more syrup?

01:46.048 --> 01:47.658
Mm-hmm.

01:49.651 --> 01:51.863
- Good morning, son. You're up early.
- Mornin'.

01:51.887 --> 01:54.832
Yeah, I wanted to swim before
I had to go give lessons.

01:56.958 --> 01:57.902
Mm.

01:57.926 --> 01:59.370
One of these days
you're gonna have to get

01:59.394 --> 02:00.538
me up on that surfboard.

02:00.562 --> 02:02.106
We'll get you a stunt double.

02:02.130 --> 02:03.808
Oh, please. I got skills, man.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.209
Mr. Johnson.

02:05.233 --> 02:06.711
I'm Detective Vincent North.

02:06.735 --> 02:08.070
Uh...

02:08.637 --> 02:10.381
Can we speak to you in private?

02:10.405 --> 02:12.850
Sure. Come on.

02:12.874 --> 02:13.818
Let's run down to the beach.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.110
Daddy will be right with you, sweetheart.

02:19.734 --> 02:20.778
What is it?

02:21.116 --> 02:24.351
Mr. Johnson, I have some very bad news.

02:26.354 --> 02:29.033
Jessica Meyer was killed this morning.

02:29.057 --> 02:30.483
What?

02:30.507 --> 02:31.836
I'm sorry.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.053
No.

02:33.628 --> 02:36.174
She...

02:36.198 --> 02:37.408
But I was making breakfast for her.

02:37.432 --> 02:39.343
She... She's supposed to be here, but...

02:39.367 --> 02:41.569
She was at the beach
preparing to meet a client.

02:43.171 --> 02:46.584
Cause of death appears to be
blunt-force trauma,

02:46.608 --> 02:48.252
and we believe she was murdered.

02:48.276 --> 02:50.688
What? No.

02:50.712 --> 02:51.923
No, not my baby.

02:51.947 --> 02:53.124
No, no, no.

02:53.148 --> 02:54.525
No.

02:54.549 --> 02:55.909
No!

03:00.722 --> 03:03.201
Look, we're gonna need you
to come down to the station

03:03.225 --> 03:05.736
and answer a few questions.

03:05.760 --> 03:07.638
Mr. Johnson.

03:07.662 --> 03:09.507
Mr. Johnson?

03:33.121 --> 03:34.765
Hello.

03:38.247 --> 03:39.804
Rough night?

03:39.828 --> 03:41.005
What happened to you?

03:41.029 --> 03:42.707
Oh, I, um...

03:42.731 --> 03:44.642
...stubbed my toe.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.713
Look, we need to talk off the record.

03:48.737 --> 03:49.811
And I would appreciate

03:49.835 --> 03:51.582
you telling the cowboy to stand down.

03:51.606 --> 03:52.984
I do not need another shiner.

03:53.008 --> 03:54.318
Oh, he's not here.

03:54.342 --> 03:55.586
Ooh. No?

03:55.610 --> 03:56.787
Which is none of your business.

03:56.811 --> 03:58.110
No, it's not.

03:58.134 --> 04:00.091
- Get to the point, Wolf.
- Right. Um...

04:00.115 --> 04:01.359
You know, it's the damndest thing.

04:02.651 --> 04:05.512
I actually think Sevvy Johnson
is innocent.

04:05.536 --> 04:07.503
- That's what you came here to tell me?
- Mm-hmm.

04:07.527 --> 04:09.800
- Goodbye.
- No, no, no, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait.

04:09.824 --> 04:11.692
I'm serious.

04:13.528 --> 04:15.696
I don't think Sevvy killed Jessica.

04:18.700 --> 04:22.887
There is nothing I hate more
than an innocent client.

04:22.911 --> 04:24.982
I mean, the guilty ones,
if they end up in jail,

04:25.006 --> 04:27.250
hey, that's probably where they belong.

04:28.210 --> 04:31.713
But the innocent ones,
they keep me up at night.

04:32.507 --> 04:36.468
They burrow into my brain,
haunt my every thought.

04:37.432 --> 04:39.199
The innocent ones torture me.

04:41.523 --> 04:44.684
So I'm here, hat in hand,

04:45.746 --> 04:47.314
asking you to talk to me.

04:49.197 --> 04:50.374
Come in.

04:53.591 --> 04:55.369
Doctor said you should take it easy.

04:55.393 --> 04:56.970
Work from home?

04:56.994 --> 04:58.338
We'll see.

04:58.362 --> 04:59.825
It's a big day for us.

05:01.032 --> 05:02.576
What do you mean?

05:02.600 --> 05:04.267
We talked about this.

05:07.805 --> 05:09.916
Effy, what did you do?

05:09.940 --> 05:11.451
It's the perfect time to announce

05:11.475 --> 05:12.486
you're running for D.A.

05:12.510 --> 05:14.521
I told you I'm not ready.

05:14.545 --> 05:15.589
Well, they're here.

05:15.613 --> 05:17.357
So get ready.

05:27.658 --> 05:29.169
Matthew,
did you think you were gonna die?

05:29.193 --> 05:31.505
Why did Maya
Travis' stalker go after you?

05:31.529 --> 05:33.507
Look, we're talking about
a deranged individual.

05:33.531 --> 05:36.376
I have no idea why he did what he did.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.378
Uh, sources say you're making
an announcement today?

05:40.704 --> 05:42.136
No. No announcement.

05:42.160 --> 05:44.751
I just want to thank CJ Emerson
for saving my life.

05:44.775 --> 05:46.553
She's the one who should be
getting the attention today,

05:46.577 --> 05:48.355
not me.

05:48.379 --> 05:50.057
Thank you.

06:50.374 --> 06:52.419
See, the key...

06:53.355 --> 06:55.106
is milk.

06:55.779 --> 06:57.651
Gives the eggs a nice fluff.

06:58.282 --> 06:59.759
You're stalling.

07:01.652 --> 07:03.096
You know, I'm only telling you
this because

07:03.120 --> 07:05.232
I know you won't let
an innocent man go to jail.

07:05.256 --> 07:06.733
I don't think he's innocent.

07:06.757 --> 07:08.078
Yet.

07:08.692 --> 07:10.070
Now, we both agree

07:10.094 --> 07:11.538
this conversation never happened.

07:11.562 --> 07:12.639
Why?

07:12.663 --> 07:15.218
Because everything that I'm about
to say to you is privileged.

07:15.242 --> 07:18.812
And I know how much you care
about legal ethics.

07:18.836 --> 07:20.780
Well, you got to work with me here.

07:20.804 --> 07:22.816
Cone of silence.

07:22.840 --> 07:24.451
So, tell me why you're supposedly

07:24.475 --> 07:26.920
so convinced Johnson didn't do it.

07:26.944 --> 07:29.556
Our trip to Vegas yielded some
very interesting information,

07:29.580 --> 07:32.292
namely Jessica was practicing
to kill Sevvy.

07:32.316 --> 07:33.960
Even hired a private shooting instructor.

07:33.984 --> 07:35.362
She was scared of him.

07:35.386 --> 07:37.353
Maybe she wanted to protect herself.

07:46.030 --> 07:48.041
She look scared to you?

07:50.287 --> 07:53.280
Then why take a secret trip to Vegas?

07:53.304 --> 07:54.881
I think she had an agenda,

07:54.905 --> 07:56.806
and I think someone was helping her.

08:00.144 --> 08:01.377
What?

08:03.547 --> 08:04.558
Nothing.

08:04.582 --> 08:07.951
No... I showed you mine.
Now you show me yours.

08:12.690 --> 08:14.968
I watched the tapes Jessica made again,

08:14.992 --> 08:17.871
and I thought I saw something...
a shadow.

08:17.895 --> 08:19.306
Someone was in the storage
locker with her.

08:19.330 --> 08:21.408
- I am almost positive.
- Oh, I knew it!

08:21.432 --> 08:23.710
It doesn't mean that person
killed Jessica.

08:23.734 --> 08:25.278
It just means there's more to the story.

08:25.302 --> 08:26.813
You know what?

08:26.837 --> 08:28.366
Let's figure this out.

08:29.206 --> 08:30.410
Together.

08:31.875 --> 08:32.953
Whatever we find,

08:32.977 --> 08:35.922
I will not hesitate to use it
against you in court.

08:35.946 --> 08:37.323
Ditto.

08:46.590 --> 08:47.719
Yeah?

08:49.293 --> 08:51.404
Brianna, thanks for coming.

08:51.428 --> 08:52.973
Your assistant said it was urgent.

08:52.997 --> 08:54.808
Well, she's prone to hyperbole.

08:54.832 --> 08:55.775
Please, come in.

08:55.799 --> 08:57.744
Did you happen to see
Chief Deputy Collier

08:57.768 --> 08:59.528
smiling for the cameras this morning?

08:59.552 --> 09:00.645
I did.

09:00.669 --> 09:03.416
Rumor has it he tried to hire you.

09:03.440 --> 09:04.718
Well, he hasn't pulled the trigger,

09:04.742 --> 09:06.219
if that's what you're wondering.

09:06.243 --> 09:08.990
Although, I did give him
some damn good advice.

09:09.546 --> 09:10.992
What was that?

09:12.216 --> 09:13.983
I'm done with freebies.

09:16.387 --> 09:18.031
All right.

09:18.055 --> 09:24.037
Here is $237.

09:24.061 --> 09:25.405
Down payment.

09:25.429 --> 09:27.540
There's more where that came from.

09:27.564 --> 09:29.302
Tens of thousands more.

09:30.334 --> 09:33.747
Let me tell you the strategy
I laid out for Matthew.

09:33.771 --> 09:34.981
It'll work for you, too.

09:37.808 --> 09:39.354
Hey, Starry.

09:40.477 --> 09:41.888
Hi.

09:44.114 --> 09:45.392
I don't want to talk to you.

09:45.416 --> 09:46.860
Either of you.

09:46.884 --> 09:47.909
Uh!

09:47.933 --> 09:49.596
You have every right to be pissed,

09:49.620 --> 09:51.398
but aren't you just a little bit curious

09:51.422 --> 09:52.932
about what we're doing here together?

10:00.964 --> 10:02.502
Okay.

10:02.933 --> 10:04.629
What's this about?

10:05.369 --> 10:07.580
It's about the tapes Jessica made.

10:07.604 --> 10:09.467
We think somebody may have been with her.

10:10.441 --> 10:11.785
Wasn't me.

10:11.809 --> 10:13.453
I didn't even know about them.

10:13.477 --> 10:14.454
Could have been a friend.

10:14.478 --> 10:15.789
Someone she was seeing on the side.

10:15.813 --> 10:17.157
If Jessica was cheating on my dad,

10:17.181 --> 10:18.915
do you think she would have
told me about it?

10:20.484 --> 10:22.028
What does this mean?

10:22.052 --> 10:25.098
We think whoever was helping
Jessica may have killed her.

10:25.122 --> 10:26.966
- I don't think that.
- Well, it's not much of a stretch.

10:26.990 --> 10:28.335
It's... I think that the person

10:28.359 --> 10:29.836
may be a part of the puzzle.

10:29.860 --> 10:30.858
But could it be your mother?

10:30.882 --> 10:32.472
I know she was trying to help Jessica.

10:32.496 --> 10:35.241
No, my mom didn't care about Jessica.

10:35.265 --> 10:37.110
She saw her as an obstacle
to my dad's money.

10:37.134 --> 10:38.197
That's it.

10:38.221 --> 10:39.268
And the second she had a chance,

10:39.292 --> 10:40.703
she had him sign everything over to her.

10:42.339 --> 10:43.950
What are you talking about?

10:43.974 --> 10:45.919
- My dad didn't tell you?
- No.

10:46.421 --> 10:48.021
If he goes to jail,

10:48.045 --> 10:51.024
my mom gets control of his entire estate.

10:55.753 --> 10:56.930
I don't want to fight today.

10:56.954 --> 10:58.254
I'm not here for that.

11:02.025 --> 11:03.855
I'm sorry about the other night.

11:08.632 --> 11:10.069
I feel like...

11:11.368 --> 11:12.781
I don't know.

11:15.072 --> 11:18.286
I feel like nothing's like
what I thought it was.

11:19.579 --> 11:21.855
It never is.

11:21.879 --> 11:24.814
I find that every time I blink,
the world shifts.

11:27.918 --> 11:30.019
Did you ever love me, Jules?

11:32.523 --> 11:35.625
I mean... really love me?

11:39.096 --> 11:40.440
Desperately.

11:54.278 --> 11:56.379
You know everything, don't you?

12:00.250 --> 12:01.484
Yeah.

12:02.861 --> 12:04.431
I'm sorry things ended this way.

12:26.621 --> 12:28.766
- Charlie, Maya Travis.
- Bay Crab hand roll?

12:28.790 --> 12:30.057
Maybe later.

12:31.526 --> 12:34.972
So, this is everything
Buck got on Julianne.

12:34.996 --> 12:36.507
When you were trying to set her up?

12:36.531 --> 12:37.608
When we were investigating,

12:37.632 --> 12:39.143
like you and I are doing right now.

12:39.167 --> 12:40.978
Julianne has an alibi.

12:41.002 --> 12:43.781
She was Vick Marshall's house
at the time of the murder...

12:43.805 --> 12:45.216
on camera.

12:45.240 --> 12:46.817
Well, tapes can be faked.

12:46.841 --> 12:48.519
- Or did you forget?
- Mm.

12:48.543 --> 12:50.521
Anyway, she could have hired
someone to do it.

12:50.545 --> 12:52.780
Did Buck find any unusual expenditures?

12:53.948 --> 12:55.693
No, but she could have set aside

12:55.717 --> 12:56.694
small amounts of cash for months.

12:56.718 --> 13:00.765
So, your theory is that
Julianne killed Jessica

13:00.789 --> 13:02.533
so that Sevvy would end up in prison

13:02.557 --> 13:04.001
and she could get his money?

13:04.025 --> 13:05.893
The woman is a master manipulator.

13:07.262 --> 13:09.106
We need to get inside Julianne's house.

13:09.130 --> 13:10.107
Well, get a search warrant.

13:10.131 --> 13:11.609
You would love that, wouldn't you?

13:11.633 --> 13:13.010
She's one of my key witnesses.

13:13.034 --> 13:14.439
It would destroy her credibility.

13:14.463 --> 13:16.403
So would a Murder One charge.

13:18.573 --> 13:20.351
I don't think we'll find anything,

13:20.375 --> 13:21.775
but we should look.

13:24.311 --> 13:26.445
Give me a couple hours. I have an idea.

13:28.882 --> 13:30.110
Okay.

13:30.134 --> 13:31.796
You're working with Ezra Wolf?

13:31.820 --> 13:34.131
Very unofficially, yes.

13:34.155 --> 13:37.001
- Maya, you know you can't trust him.
- I don't.

13:37.025 --> 13:39.504
But I need to know who that shadow was.

13:39.504 --> 13:42.350
And if Jessica really was
planning on killing Sevvy,

13:42.374 --> 13:44.251
that makes me question everything.

13:44.275 --> 13:45.353
Even whether he did it?

13:45.377 --> 13:47.044
Even that.

13:51.282 --> 13:54.428
I need to know the truth, whatever it is.

13:54.452 --> 13:55.600
Julianne?

13:55.624 --> 13:57.498
She lied to the police multiple times,

13:57.522 --> 13:59.200
and she had motive.

13:59.224 --> 14:00.782
Follow the money.

14:01.960 --> 14:03.871
I guess it's possible.

14:03.895 --> 14:06.107
- I need a favor.
- Sure. Anything.

14:06.131 --> 14:07.541
I really shouldn't even be asking this.

14:07.565 --> 14:09.443
Maya, I am a grown-ass woman.

14:09.467 --> 14:10.434
Just spit it out.

14:11.803 --> 14:13.837
It's not exactly legal.

14:18.410 --> 14:21.022
Quick, quick.

14:21.046 --> 14:23.391
Jump on my back.

14:23.415 --> 14:26.494
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

14:29.054 --> 14:30.998
Hey, look, here comes your sister.

14:31.022 --> 14:33.000
- Star!
- Hey, Peanut.

14:37.996 --> 14:39.573
What are you doing here?

14:39.597 --> 14:42.410
Star's gonna take care of you
for a few days.

14:42.434 --> 14:45.579
Daddy's got some grownup things
to take care of.

14:45.603 --> 14:47.748
Why don't you go gather your stuff?

14:54.012 --> 14:55.189
Thank you.

14:55.213 --> 14:56.624
Of course.

14:56.648 --> 14:58.426
She's my sister.

15:04.589 --> 15:06.023
I love you, Star.

15:08.226 --> 15:10.705
Sunny can stay with me
as long as you need.

15:16.968 --> 15:18.446
You ready to go?

15:18.470 --> 15:19.547
All right.

15:29.080 --> 15:32.493
Big things are afoot, people,
and we're gonna be prepared.

15:32.517 --> 15:35.429
I've been working with someone,
who shall not be named.

15:35.453 --> 15:38.265
Suffice it to say that
I have reason to believe

15:38.289 --> 15:41.001
Sevvy Johnson's nightmare
is going to end.

15:41.025 --> 15:42.703
He is going to go free.

15:42.727 --> 15:46.207
I have decided that the time is right

15:46.231 --> 15:48.242
to prepare a motion to dismiss.

15:48.266 --> 15:50.478
As you know, this motion needs to be...

15:50.502 --> 15:53.681
- Ezra!
- Charlie.

15:53.705 --> 15:56.417
The D.A.'s making some
announcement about Sevvy's case.

15:56.441 --> 15:57.618
- What?
- Thank you, everyone,

15:57.642 --> 15:59.587
for gathering on such short notice.

15:59.611 --> 16:01.822
As District Attorney of Los Angeles,

16:01.846 --> 16:06.727
I pride myself on the integrity
of my team and our mission.

16:10.245 --> 16:11.762
_

16:13.525 --> 16:15.870
Unfortunately,
the murder of Jessica Meyer

16:15.894 --> 16:18.639
has been tragically mishandled.

16:18.663 --> 16:20.341
Despite my personal misgivings,

16:20.365 --> 16:22.977
I allowed Chief Deputy
D.A. Matthew Collier

16:23.001 --> 16:25.346
to bring Former Deputy D.A. Maya Travis

16:25.370 --> 16:27.248
onto the Jessica Meyer case.

16:27.272 --> 16:30.751
What's become clear is that
both Mr. Collier and Ms. Travis

16:30.775 --> 16:33.654
have a personal vendetta
against Mr. Johnson...

16:33.678 --> 16:35.256
a vendetta that has blinded them

16:35.280 --> 16:37.825
to the truth surrounding
this horrific crime.

16:37.849 --> 16:40.494
Any future investigation
will be done by people

16:40.518 --> 16:43.330
who have not been tainted
by this disaster.

16:43.354 --> 16:47.434
I have no choice but to drop the
charges against Severen Johnson.

16:47.458 --> 16:49.870
I am going to dismiss this case.

16:49.894 --> 16:52.807
Son of a bitch.

16:52.831 --> 16:54.508
You stole my thunder.

16:57.175 --> 16:58.781
You have got to be kidding me!

16:58.805 --> 17:00.875
This case has been
a nightmare from Day One,

17:00.899 --> 17:02.313
and it's gone downhill from there.

17:02.314 --> 17:03.425
- And the fact that you don't see that...
- Oh, come on! How can you...

17:03.449 --> 17:06.394
You can't just dismiss my case
without consulting me.

17:06.417 --> 17:09.309
I don't need your permission
to do anything!

17:09.334 --> 17:10.494
That wasn't a press conference.

17:10.519 --> 17:11.895
It was a character assassination.

17:11.919 --> 17:13.656
Well, I call it like I see it.

17:13.682 --> 17:15.160
This isn't about us, and you know it.

17:15.184 --> 17:16.594
It's about you and your election.

17:16.617 --> 17:19.030
You might win.
Voters don't know any better.

17:19.054 --> 17:20.799
But the people in this office do.

17:20.823 --> 17:22.800
And after that move that
you pulled today,

17:22.825 --> 17:25.670
not one of them will respect you
because you're a coward.

17:25.694 --> 17:28.173
My move is the one you forced me to make!

17:28.196 --> 17:29.607
Feel free to step aside.

17:29.631 --> 17:32.143
I will have someone else
go to court and dismiss.

17:32.167 --> 17:34.312
This is still my case. I'll handle it.

17:41.076 --> 17:42.153
I can't believe Wiest,

17:42.177 --> 17:43.922
throwing us under the bus like that.

17:43.946 --> 17:45.214
But that's exactly what

17:45.238 --> 17:47.383
you were planning to do to me, isn't it?

17:48.851 --> 17:51.696
- What do you mean?
- Effy told me your plan.

17:51.720 --> 17:54.199
You wanted to use me for cover
if the case fell apart

17:54.223 --> 17:55.867
so you'd be in the clear to run for D.A.

17:55.891 --> 17:58.201
- Maya...
- Don't come to court with me.

17:58.225 --> 17:59.704
I don't want you there.

18:09.037 --> 18:11.616
The D.A.'s office just
held a press conference.

18:11.640 --> 18:13.784
They're dismissing the case.

18:15.777 --> 18:17.122
They can't do that.

18:17.146 --> 18:18.690
There's nothing we can do.

18:18.714 --> 18:20.225
We lost.

18:24.486 --> 18:27.198
I think it's time for you
to find a place of your own.

19:37.292 --> 19:40.104
There has been yet
another bombshell development

19:40.128 --> 19:42.874
in the murder case against
movie star Sevvy Johnson.

19:42.898 --> 19:45.009
All parties are due in court
within the hour

19:45.033 --> 19:47.512
where prosecutors are expected
to make a motion

19:47.536 --> 19:50.715
to dismiss charges against
the embattled actor.

19:50.739 --> 19:53.284
D.A. Alan Wiest swears
that the investigation

19:53.308 --> 19:55.720
into Jessica Meyer's
murder will continue.

19:59.881 --> 20:00.792
Hey, Dad.

20:00.816 --> 20:01.826
You ready?

20:03.185 --> 20:04.762
Yeah.

20:04.786 --> 20:05.797
Don't want to be late.

20:07.856 --> 20:08.933
Can you drive to court?

20:08.957 --> 20:10.902
I'm feeling a little keyed up.

20:10.926 --> 20:12.120
We taking the Maybach?

20:12.144 --> 20:14.806
- Mm-hmm.
- I guess I can make the sacrifice then.

20:22.337 --> 20:25.783
Couldn't pass up a chance to gloat.

20:25.807 --> 20:29.387
Oh, I just wanted to say I wish
it hadn't gone down this way.

20:29.411 --> 20:32.156
I really wanted to beat you
in a fair fight.

20:32.180 --> 20:35.109
Since when are you
interested in a fair fight?

20:36.018 --> 20:37.157
You ready?

20:47.362 --> 20:50.575
About the S.I.D. investigation,

20:50.599 --> 20:52.377
Loni told you you were a target...

20:52.401 --> 20:53.645
total B.S.

20:53.669 --> 20:54.846
Wiest made the whole thing up.

21:03.912 --> 21:05.156
Great day, my man.

21:05.180 --> 21:06.858
I always knew it was coming.

21:06.882 --> 21:08.434
All rise.

21:09.505 --> 21:11.863
Department 125,
Superior Court of Los Angeles

21:11.887 --> 21:13.564
is now in session.

21:13.588 --> 21:15.166
Judge Song presiding.

21:15.925 --> 21:17.224
Be seated.

21:19.136 --> 21:22.106
Calling the case of
People v. Severen Johnson.

21:22.130 --> 21:24.242
We're here on a People's motion
to dismiss...

21:24.266 --> 21:25.910
Your Honor.

21:25.934 --> 21:27.812
I'm sorry to interrupt,

21:27.836 --> 21:30.381
but before you go any further,
I'm firing my lawyer.

21:30.405 --> 21:31.949
- I'm going pro per.
- Sevvy, wa...

21:31.973 --> 21:34.319
I want to represent myself.

21:36.778 --> 21:41.659
Your Honor, I'm changing my plea.

21:41.683 --> 21:44.929
I plead... guilty.

21:47.656 --> 21:48.933
Your Honor, we just need a minute here.

21:48.957 --> 21:50.034
Just... we just need a minute.

21:50.058 --> 21:51.202
What are you talking about?!

21:59.026 --> 22:00.694
What the hell are you doing?!

22:00.727 --> 22:01.737
I had this!

22:01.761 --> 22:03.496
Are you out of your mind?!

22:04.865 --> 22:06.843
I had to do the right thing.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.377
This whole time...

22:08.401 --> 22:10.179
"I'm innocent! I'm innocent!"

22:10.203 --> 22:12.147
Now all of a sudden, you're guilty.

22:13.406 --> 22:15.685
You're protecting someone, aren't you?

22:15.709 --> 22:16.986
Who is it?

22:17.711 --> 22:20.156
Sevvy, I can't let you do this.

22:20.180 --> 22:21.780
You can't stop me.

22:23.416 --> 22:25.061
I'm not gonna give this up.

22:25.085 --> 22:27.029
I'm gonna find out the truth.

22:34.094 --> 22:37.373
You fought to the death
for me over the years.

22:42.802 --> 22:45.214
And you've even been a friend
when I needed one.

22:45.238 --> 22:46.249
Okay.

22:46.273 --> 22:49.708
This is my choice to make.

22:52.980 --> 22:54.647
And I've made my choice.

22:57.067 --> 22:58.427
It's done.

23:41.761 --> 23:43.238
You did it.

23:44.810 --> 23:46.144
You got him.

23:47.687 --> 23:48.854
Did I?

23:51.538 --> 23:55.793
Sevvy Johnson is gonna spend
the rest of his life in jail.

23:56.876 --> 23:59.222
That's been our dream for eight years.

23:59.246 --> 24:01.190
I know.

24:01.214 --> 24:05.251
Somehow I just feel hollow.

24:07.854 --> 24:10.700
You think you're gonna know
how you'll feel

24:10.724 --> 24:12.359
when you get what you want,

24:12.383 --> 24:15.227
but it doesn't always work out that way.

24:18.158 --> 24:19.925
Maya, I'm sorry.

24:22.655 --> 24:24.255
About everything.

24:26.605 --> 24:28.909
For awhile, I, uh...

24:31.161 --> 24:33.856
I think I lost sight of who I really am.

24:39.486 --> 24:42.665
But I've decided I'm not
gonna run for D.A.,

24:43.052 --> 24:44.563
and I'm resigning as Chief Deputy.

24:44.587 --> 24:46.677
I'm gonna back into the court room.

24:47.823 --> 24:49.805
You were right.

24:50.559 --> 24:52.093
This is where I belong.

25:00.158 --> 25:02.158
_

25:03.773 --> 25:05.441
I have to go.

25:41.243 --> 25:43.188
What are you gonna do?

25:43.212 --> 25:44.256
I don't know.

26:03.099 --> 26:05.088
I thought I might find you here.

26:06.769 --> 26:08.847
What are you doing with my mom's diary?

26:11.173 --> 26:14.242
We found it in your duffel bag
at Julianne's.

26:16.545 --> 26:19.157
I wish I'd had it eight years ago.

26:19.181 --> 26:21.416
Things might have turned out
a lot differently.

26:24.653 --> 26:26.421
Help me understand, Gabe.

26:29.358 --> 26:31.903
Why did you kill Jessica?

26:45.466 --> 26:47.052
Is that her signature?

26:47.076 --> 26:49.813
When your mother decided
to divorce Mr. Johnson,

26:49.837 --> 26:52.283
she left certain items with us
for safe keeping.

26:52.307 --> 26:54.251
After she died, we retained them.

26:55.343 --> 26:58.322
Now that you're 21,
we are releasing them to you.

26:58.346 --> 26:59.723
You may open the envelope.

27:06.154 --> 27:09.366
We'll itemize the contents of
the box as you remove them.

27:15.363 --> 27:18.161
One envelope, containing HH Bonds.

27:19.434 --> 27:22.302
One pearl necklace in a velvet case.

27:26.736 --> 27:29.186
One green journal.

27:45.460 --> 27:47.338
Hey.

27:47.362 --> 27:48.572
Are you okay?

27:48.596 --> 27:50.297
I saw you from upstairs.

27:51.933 --> 27:53.405
I don't know.

27:54.140 --> 27:55.679
What's going on?

28:01.509 --> 28:03.010
That's my mom's.

28:10.218 --> 28:11.840
Oh, my God.

28:12.754 --> 28:14.898
Is that the part where he choked her,

28:14.922 --> 28:18.692
or he punched her for coming
home late without calling?

28:22.430 --> 28:24.164
Does he do those things to you?

28:36.844 --> 28:39.890
It had been going on for months.

28:39.914 --> 28:42.015
He'd hit her or shove her.

28:44.185 --> 28:47.231
Didn't feel bad,
didn't try to make up for it.

28:47.255 --> 28:49.586
Jess thought about leaving him, but...

28:51.678 --> 28:54.580
that didn't work out well
for my mom, did it?

28:55.696 --> 28:58.865
Was it your idea
or Jessica's to kill him?

29:02.970 --> 29:04.371
I don't even know.

29:06.507 --> 29:09.773
It's like we just said
we should do this, and...

29:11.345 --> 29:13.257
suddenly, we were really doing it.

29:13.281 --> 29:16.260
But you wanted to make it
look like self defense.

29:16.284 --> 29:20.450
Yeah, so we knew we needed proof

29:21.289 --> 29:22.366
of what he was doing.

29:22.390 --> 29:25.803
And we... we needed witnesses
who would back us up.

29:25.827 --> 29:27.771
Julianne and Ben Mitchell.

29:27.795 --> 29:29.029
Yeah.

29:31.299 --> 29:33.380
Tell me about the tapes, Gabe.

29:33.935 --> 29:36.466
You were with Jessica when
she made them, weren't you?

29:37.004 --> 29:38.593
They were my idea.

29:39.407 --> 29:41.885
And whose idea was it for Jessica

29:41.909 --> 29:44.154
to kill Sevvy with his own gun?

29:44.178 --> 29:46.757
She knew about the gun in the nightstand.

29:46.781 --> 29:48.826
I just said that
that could be a good way.

29:48.850 --> 29:53.954
And right when we were ready to
do it, they took some trip.

29:56.858 --> 29:59.470
He did some kind of magic therapy,

29:59.494 --> 30:03.107
and she decided that their relationship

30:03.131 --> 30:04.007
was better than ever,

30:04.031 --> 30:06.477
like the therapy fixed him or something.

30:06.501 --> 30:07.478
But you didn't believe that.

30:07.502 --> 30:09.546
You think he didn't have
good times with my mom?

30:09.570 --> 30:10.792
He did.

30:12.006 --> 30:13.540
Months even.

30:15.376 --> 30:17.521
Then it would always happen again.

30:17.545 --> 30:20.257
But Jessica thought he really changed.

30:20.281 --> 30:21.890
That morning, I just
wanted to talk to her.

30:21.915 --> 30:25.963
I just... wanted to try
to get her to see.

30:25.987 --> 30:27.931
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

30:27.955 --> 30:29.500
We had a plan. You can't just back out!

30:29.524 --> 30:31.590
- He's not gonna stop.
- He has stopped!

30:31.614 --> 30:32.697
For how long?

30:32.721 --> 30:34.471
Look, Gabe, the plan is off, okay?

30:34.495 --> 30:36.206
I'm telling you, he's changed.

30:36.230 --> 30:37.641
You can't actually think that!

30:37.665 --> 30:40.110
You don't see him the way that I do.

30:40.134 --> 30:41.545
So, what, you're all good now,

30:41.569 --> 30:42.643
and that's all that matters?

30:42.667 --> 30:43.679
What about my mom?

30:43.703 --> 30:45.516
I'm... I'm sorry about
what happened to her.

30:45.540 --> 30:47.017
- I am, but...
- He murdered her!

30:47.041 --> 30:48.552
Just stop, okay?!

30:48.576 --> 30:49.848
Look, it was a stupid plan,

30:49.873 --> 30:51.054
- and it's not...
- No.

30:51.078 --> 30:52.356
- We're supposed to make things right!
- No, it's not going to...

30:52.380 --> 30:54.358
- And I'm not gonna stop!
- No. Yes, you are!

30:54.382 --> 30:57.294
It's over. I'm calling him.

30:57.318 --> 30:58.562
No!

31:10.565 --> 31:12.052
I didn't go there to kill her.

31:12.076 --> 31:14.397
I just lost control.

31:15.570 --> 31:19.216
When I saw her lying there,
I knew what I had to do.

31:19.240 --> 31:21.518
Sevvy's towel was in my car.

31:21.542 --> 31:23.687
He had played tennis the day before.

31:23.711 --> 31:26.243
Sweat was all over it.

31:31.419 --> 31:33.520
But she didn't deserve to die.

31:35.289 --> 31:37.409
She didn't deserve to die.

31:38.492 --> 31:40.804
I'm so sorry.

32:07.588 --> 32:09.389
I can't let this stand.

32:11.492 --> 32:13.503
I'll file a motion to vacate the plea.

32:13.527 --> 32:14.938
No, you won't.

32:14.962 --> 32:17.241
You didn't kill Jessica.

32:24.472 --> 32:26.250
I killed Cassandra.

32:33.481 --> 32:35.482
I killed Nancy.

32:37.384 --> 32:39.829
- That's over.
- No.

32:39.854 --> 32:41.765
No, it's not.

32:41.889 --> 32:43.934
Gabe finding out the truth
about his mum...

32:43.958 --> 32:46.336
that's what started this.

32:46.360 --> 32:48.128
You know about the diary.

32:49.697 --> 32:51.108
In the trial eight years ago,

32:51.132 --> 32:52.976
I kept waiting for it to come out,

32:53.000 --> 32:55.779
waiting for her words to damn me.

32:55.803 --> 32:57.948
Gabe never should have seen that.

32:57.972 --> 33:00.284
But he did.

33:00.308 --> 33:02.409
How did you figure out it was him?

33:03.911 --> 33:06.657
I opened a letter from the lawyer.

33:07.218 --> 33:09.026
I thought it was for me.

33:09.050 --> 33:10.794
When I saw he'd gotten the diary,

33:10.818 --> 33:12.829
everything made sense.

33:12.853 --> 33:15.265
The jacket showing up
after the bail hearing,

33:15.289 --> 33:17.354
my DNA at the scene.

33:18.659 --> 33:19.939
Gabe...

33:21.862 --> 33:23.860
Gabe would have been able to do that.

33:25.200 --> 33:27.072
I need you to understand...

33:28.636 --> 33:30.337
this is my fault.

33:33.040 --> 33:35.152
Gabe murdered the woman you love.

33:35.176 --> 33:37.754
Because I murdered his mother!

33:37.778 --> 33:40.023
But you didn't kill Jessica.

33:40.047 --> 33:43.694
But I may as well have done it
with my own two hands.

33:43.718 --> 33:46.229
Don't you see?

33:46.253 --> 33:48.332
Everything that's happened...

33:48.356 --> 33:49.866
everything...

33:49.890 --> 33:52.305
everything that happened...

33:53.594 --> 33:55.261
is all my fault.

33:56.617 --> 34:00.420
So please, I-I'm begging you.

34:04.198 --> 34:05.476
Let it stand.

34:13.514 --> 34:16.427
Nine years ago, Sevvy Johnson
murdered his wife Cassandra

34:16.451 --> 34:19.096
and her friend, Nancy Weeks.

34:19.120 --> 34:22.966
Today, he pled to guilty to
the murder of Jessica Meyer.

34:33.167 --> 34:36.045
Mr. Johnson will spend
the rest of his life in prison,

34:36.070 --> 34:38.148
which is where he belongs.

34:38.810 --> 34:41.108
Today, justice was finally served.

34:42.563 --> 34:44.621
I hope this brings the victims' families

34:44.645 --> 34:46.389
some measure of peace.

34:49.987 --> 34:51.614
Mm.

34:53.187 --> 34:55.766
She'll never be able
to live with herself.

34:55.790 --> 34:58.224
Why? Because she beat you?

34:58.248 --> 35:00.204
Well, she won, but she didn't beat me.

35:00.682 --> 35:02.058
There's a big difference.

35:02.617 --> 35:04.795
Look, I came here because I feel bad

35:04.819 --> 35:06.530
about what happened to your investigator.

35:06.554 --> 35:08.732
Let's not rehash the past.

35:08.756 --> 35:11.569
I called you to talk about the future.

35:11.593 --> 35:13.304
My firm needs fresh blood,

35:13.328 --> 35:15.506
and I hear you're in need of a job.

35:15.530 --> 35:17.675
- So, you want me to work for you?
- I do.

35:17.699 --> 35:19.810
Why would I do that?

35:19.834 --> 35:21.635
My undeniable charm.

35:25.506 --> 35:26.984
You want to screw over Wiest.

35:27.901 --> 35:29.920
Maybe.

35:29.944 --> 35:31.455
A little bit.

35:32.714 --> 35:33.990
Also, you...

35:34.816 --> 35:36.293
you're good.

35:48.663 --> 35:50.374
You really think you're worth this much?

35:50.398 --> 35:51.898
Every penny.

35:55.336 --> 35:57.281
Welcome to Wolf and Associates.

36:04.846 --> 36:07.120
Snacks for the drive.
Why don't you put them in the back seat?

36:07.145 --> 36:08.149
Okay.

36:10.952 --> 36:13.230
- Go in and check your room.
- Okay.

36:13.254 --> 36:15.689
- Hi, Julianne!
- Hi, honey.

36:17.692 --> 36:18.736
We're leaving.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.237
- Star...
- No.

36:20.261 --> 36:22.239
I'm taking her away from you,

36:22.263 --> 36:24.241
away from this entire screwed up family.

36:24.265 --> 36:25.643
I want her to have a fighting chance

36:25.667 --> 36:26.677
at something normal.

36:26.701 --> 36:28.579
Everything I have ever done

36:28.603 --> 36:30.714
was for you and your brothers.

36:30.738 --> 36:32.616
Is that what you tell yourself?

36:33.341 --> 36:35.252
I want you to be happy, Star.

36:35.276 --> 36:36.465
I really do.

36:36.489 --> 36:37.765
Got everything.

36:38.304 --> 36:40.647
Hey, you, come here. Give me a hug.

36:43.551 --> 36:45.152
I'm gonna miss that face.

36:48.790 --> 36:50.701
All right, kiddo. Let's go.

37:38.940 --> 37:40.651
Thank you for coming.

37:40.675 --> 37:42.820
Maya said that I should.

37:48.583 --> 37:50.828
Son, I don't have the right to ask...

37:50.852 --> 37:52.629
How are you gonna call me "son"
after all this?

37:52.653 --> 37:55.389
...but I need you to make me a promise.

37:58.793 --> 38:01.554
Promise me you'll make it
mean something, son,

38:02.430 --> 38:04.157
and that you'll put the weight of this

38:04.181 --> 38:07.367
where it really belongs... on me.

38:10.138 --> 38:12.106
I need you to hear that

38:13.541 --> 38:18.071
and know that I'm sitting here
for the rest of my life

38:19.547 --> 38:21.991
because I understand what I took from you

38:22.784 --> 38:24.718
and the pain I've caused you.

38:28.856 --> 38:31.625
Promise me that you'll make
this mean something.

38:33.728 --> 38:35.762
Live your life.

38:37.565 --> 38:39.877
How am I supposed to do that?

38:43.271 --> 38:48.552
Just wake up every day and s-start again.

39:50.905 --> 39:52.305
I did the right thing?

39:53.341 --> 39:54.584
Yeah.

39:55.209 --> 39:56.887
You did.

42:12.380 --> 42:14.591
Yes.
