We could get her to talk.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.519
Yeah.

10:44.519 --> 10:46.813
We have to find her first,

10:46.813 --> 10:48.982

Well, if she
watched them play the game...

how Violet's supposed to die.

It's just a game.

You're wasting your time.

12:40.051 --> 12:42.679

all this way to get it.

I went back to Gabby's.

14:10.433 --> 14:13.478

is gonna survive,
