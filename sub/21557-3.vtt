WEBVTT

00:02.659 --> 00:03.950
with the coolest girl

00:03.951 --> 00:05.475
on the entire planet:

00:05.476 --> 00:06.576
my daughter.

00:06.577 --> 00:08.411
Marley, what's rule number one?

00:08.412 --> 00:10.246
I will never grow up.

00:10.247 --> 00:12.015
And what's rule number two?

00:12.016 --> 00:15.151
I'll never, ever, ever grow up.

00:15.152 --> 00:16.152
And what you gonna do

00:16.152 --> 00:18.221
when them boys start showing up?

00:18.222 --> 00:20.256
Boys are gross, so I'll be throwing up.

00:20.257 --> 00:21.291
Ugh.

00:28.766 --> 00:33.703
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#FF0000"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#FF0000"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

00:35.372 --> 00:36.773
Yes!

00:36.774 --> 00:38.007
Ah!

00:38.008 --> 00:40.743
I did that do till it was done, honey.

00:41.846 --> 00:46.082
Ashley, doesn't she look amazing?

00:46.083 --> 00:48.318
More like amazed.

00:48.319 --> 00:51.253
Yeah, I can't really close my eyes.

00:52.122 --> 00:54.357
Hello, people I love.

00:54.358 --> 00:56.493
Mm. Yvette.

00:56.494 --> 00:58.995
Stevie, who are you on the phone with?

00:58.996 --> 01:00.396
Radio station. Been on hold for hours

01:00.397 --> 01:01.331
trying to win Beyoncé tickets.

01:01.332 --> 01:02.999
Uh, thanks, Aunt Yvette.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.768
I'm gonna go look at
it in the big mirror.

01:08.004 --> 01:08.870
Y... hey.

01:10.708 --> 01:12.074
Mm-mm.

01:13.477 --> 01:16.746
Did she just Jackie Chan my hug and kiss?

01:16.747 --> 01:19.315
You know, she's been
doing that a lot lately.

01:19.316 --> 01:20.583
It's kind of weird, you know?

01:20.584 --> 01:23.186
She's wearing perfume, new hairdo,

01:23.187 --> 01:25.288
won't let me look over her
shoulder when she's texting.

01:25.289 --> 01:28.191
It's all sneaky, like...

01:28.192 --> 01:30.226
Well, I think it's pretty obvious

01:30.227 --> 01:31.227
what's going on here.

01:31.228 --> 01:32.695
- Yeah.
- Damn right.

01:32.696 --> 01:35.231
Our baby girl's dealing drugs.

01:35.232 --> 01:38.301
Marlon, she wants to look good for boys.

01:38.302 --> 01:39.936
Don't be ridiculous.

01:40.905 --> 01:42.372
Marlon, you can act a fool

01:42.373 --> 01:44.107
all you want, but your baby girl

01:44.108 --> 01:47.277
is crushing on a dude,
and y'all better get ready,

01:47.278 --> 01:48.912
'cause the party is about to start.

01:49.980 --> 01:51.648
Well, uh, we black,

01:51.649 --> 01:56.152
and, uh, we coming to that party late.

01:56.153 --> 01:59.856
Yvette, he has been dreading this moment

01:59.857 --> 02:01.658
for Marley's entire life.

02:01.659 --> 02:04.294
Because where I'm from,
you have a crush at 14,

02:04.295 --> 02:05.662
you're pregnant by 16,

02:05.663 --> 02:07.630
and you a grandma by 28.

02:07.631 --> 02:09.232
Now, I ain't going to have no little boy

02:09.233 --> 02:10.933
with some nappy hair,
talking about, "Hey, Papa."

02:10.934 --> 02:12.435
No.

02:12.436 --> 02:15.538
No, little Negro. Call me Marlon.

02:15.539 --> 02:18.041
Marlon, I remember my first crush.

02:18.042 --> 02:19.442
I think I was, like, 12.

02:19.443 --> 02:20.910
12?

02:20.911 --> 02:24.447
Look, I ain't saying you a ho,

02:24.448 --> 02:27.817
but that's on the spectrum.

02:27.818 --> 02:29.018
Actually, Marlon,

02:29.019 --> 02:31.154
12 is when primitive females gave birth.

02:31.155 --> 02:33.656
The pelvis starts to expand
to accommodate the baby's...

02:33.657 --> 02:35.123
Hello?

02:36.827 --> 02:40.730
Why, yes, I would enjoy
two free Beyoncé tickets.

02:40.731 --> 02:41.998
I will hold.

02:41.999 --> 02:43.399
Stevie?

02:43.400 --> 02:44.934
I never realized that we both

02:44.935 --> 02:47.437
were fans of Beyoncé.

02:47.438 --> 02:50.473
How about we talk about
it over dinner tonight?

02:50.474 --> 02:52.775
My treat?

02:52.776 --> 02:54.177
I see what you're doing, Yvette.

02:54.178 --> 02:55.478
Uh-huh.

02:55.479 --> 02:58.181
And I'm gonna let you do it.

02:58.182 --> 03:00.550
I'd like to eat at the Rainforest Cafe.

03:00.551 --> 03:02.485
The Rainforest Cafe?

03:02.486 --> 03:04.887
That stupid place with
all the mechanical parrots

03:04.888 --> 03:05.922
and all that humidity?

03:05.923 --> 03:06.956
Do you know what that place

03:06.957 --> 03:08.725
is gonna do to my hair?

03:08.726 --> 03:10.859
Yes, I do.

03:12.096 --> 03:14.697
Marlon, how exciting.

03:14.698 --> 03:16.699
Our baby has her first crush.

03:16.700 --> 03:19.802
It's gonna be a long time
before that party starts.

03:21.939 --> 03:24.707
Well, the clown's here.

03:24.708 --> 03:27.276
Uh, I don't know if you guys can tell,

03:27.277 --> 03:29.445
but I put on a little makeup.

03:29.446 --> 03:31.381
- No, are you kidding me?
- No, it looks so natural.

03:31.382 --> 03:32.515
I didn't even know.

03:32.516 --> 03:34.450
I thought you woke up like this.

03:34.451 --> 03:35.752
Dang.

03:35.753 --> 03:38.620
Your face makes me want a Happy Meal.

03:42.226 --> 03:44.994
Well, there's this boy at school, and...

03:44.995 --> 03:46.195
I really like him,

03:46.196 --> 03:48.097
and he asked if he can come over here

03:48.098 --> 03:50.299
to study tomorrow night
for our geometry test.

03:50.300 --> 03:52.335
Oh, sweetheart.

03:52.336 --> 03:55.104
Yay. That's so great.

03:55.105 --> 03:56.105
Oh, yeah.

03:56.106 --> 03:57.573
Of course he can come.

03:57.574 --> 04:00.275
Isn't that wonderful, Marlon?

04:04.615 --> 04:06.983
Marlon.

04:06.984 --> 04:09.686
Yeah.

04:09.687 --> 04:12.655
My little girl...

04:12.656 --> 04:14.290
into boys.

04:21.065 --> 04:25.368
Why?

04:31.759 --> 04:32.792
Okay, stop that.

04:32.793 --> 04:35.161
We need to discuss this rationally.

04:35.162 --> 04:36.796
Okay, let's be rational.

04:36.797 --> 04:37.998
I don't want my daughter dating

04:37.999 --> 04:40.133
until we're both dead,

04:40.134 --> 04:42.602
and you're gonna go first...

04:42.603 --> 04:43.637
because I eat well,

04:43.638 --> 04:45.274
and you got a really bad habit

04:45.275 --> 04:47.607
of texting and driving.

04:47.608 --> 04:48.575
Okay.

04:48.576 --> 04:50.010
You know, you always do this.

04:50.011 --> 04:51.912
Remember when you said
that she was too young

04:51.913 --> 04:53.880
to take the training
wheels off her bicycle?

04:53.881 --> 04:56.416
And remember what happened
when you took them off?

04:56.417 --> 04:58.810
She got a bump on the chin,
four stitches on the head.

04:58.811 --> 05:02.489
Girl walking around looking
like little black Frankenstein.

05:02.490 --> 05:03.790
Look, she's not ready.

05:03.791 --> 05:06.059
She is ready.

05:06.060 --> 05:07.694
And you know what, Marlon?

05:07.695 --> 05:10.163
We're lucky that she came to us.

05:10.164 --> 05:11.464
I tried to go to my dad,

05:11.465 --> 05:13.297
and like you, he overreacted.

05:13.298 --> 05:14.482
I couldn't talk to him.

05:14.483 --> 05:16.937
I learned everything I
know now from Prince lyrics.

05:16.938 --> 05:19.539
Oh, damn.

05:19.540 --> 05:23.877
I don't want my baby in a
hotel lobby with a magazine.

05:23.878 --> 05:25.278
This is happening.

05:25.279 --> 05:27.380
Now, you can either resist it,

05:27.381 --> 05:30.383
or you can embrace it.

05:30.384 --> 05:32.052
Can't we just stuff her back up in there,

05:32.053 --> 05:33.819
and let her, like...

05:37.491 --> 05:38.959
Hey, baby girl.

05:38.960 --> 05:43.095
So... you like a boy.

05:45.900 --> 05:49.235
So uh, what's the little guy's name?

05:49.236 --> 05:50.704
Eugene.

05:50.705 --> 05:53.472
Eugene!

05:55.576 --> 05:58.510
That's a nice, nerd name.

05:59.914 --> 06:01.314
I'm intrigued.

06:01.315 --> 06:03.450
Tell me about Eugene.

06:03.451 --> 06:05.919
Well, I met him in the drama club, so...

06:05.920 --> 06:08.254
Drama club?

06:08.255 --> 06:12.124
Drama club Eugene!

06:14.996 --> 06:17.963
Oh, do go on.

06:18.866 --> 06:20.300
And he kind of helps out

06:20.301 --> 06:22.102
with the football team.

06:22.103 --> 06:23.735
Water boy!

06:25.172 --> 06:27.140
I'm so nervous.

06:27.141 --> 06:29.676
How do I know if a boy even likes me?

06:29.677 --> 06:32.912
Well, when a boy likes a girl,

06:32.913 --> 06:34.581
he gives her certain looks, right?

06:34.582 --> 06:36.801
It's like your mom. When I first saw her,

06:36.802 --> 06:38.565
I gave her the look over
the chain link fence.

06:38.566 --> 06:40.080
Like, "Hey."

06:40.554 --> 06:41.888
Look at her over there giggling.

06:41.889 --> 06:43.490
Look, see, that's when I knew I had her.

06:43.491 --> 06:44.924
She was like, "Mm-hmm,

06:44.925 --> 06:48.561
"I see you over there, Slim.

06:48.562 --> 06:52.499
"With your nappy, curly hair...

06:52.500 --> 06:55.969
"and your lil' cocoa-brown complexion.

06:55.970 --> 06:57.470
"I know you got some Indian in you,

06:57.471 --> 06:59.406
"and I'm not talking
about the kind with curry.

06:59.407 --> 07:01.841
"It's either Cherokee,

07:01.842 --> 07:04.009
or you Blackfooted-ed."

07:08.883 --> 07:11.918
Yeah, I don't think I can pull that off.

07:11.919 --> 07:13.720
A'ight.

07:13.721 --> 07:17.023
All you have to do is be yourself.

07:17.024 --> 07:19.759
You know, the day you were born,

07:19.760 --> 07:21.728
I fell in love with you,

07:21.729 --> 07:23.863
and I'm pretty sure Eugene will too.

07:23.864 --> 07:26.398
Thanks, Daddy.

07:28.803 --> 07:31.838
You know, sometimes you
really have a way with words.

07:31.839 --> 07:33.839
I hit you off, right?

07:35.176 --> 07:37.444
And sometimes you don't.

07:41.515 --> 07:44.284
Marley's friend is
gonna be here any minute.

07:44.285 --> 07:45.652
You sure you gonna be okay?

07:45.653 --> 07:48.254
I'm good. He's a nerd.

07:49.857 --> 07:51.357
There he is right now.

07:51.358 --> 07:53.026
He's probably gonna be like,

07:53.027 --> 07:55.929
"Hi.

07:55.930 --> 07:57.864
"My name is Eugene.

07:57.865 --> 08:01.801
"I love washing jockstraps,

08:01.802 --> 08:04.003
"and I'm totally into
the 'Hamilton' soundtrack,

08:04.004 --> 08:06.238
'cause it makes me feel so swagged out."

08:07.908 --> 08:10.042
I'll be fine.

08:11.579 --> 08:14.047
Hey, uh, is Marley home?

08:14.048 --> 08:15.982
Yeah.

08:15.983 --> 08:17.883
Give me one second, brah.

08:20.254 --> 08:22.087
That's a dead man right there.

08:25.980 --> 08:27.347
15.

08:27.348 --> 08:31.184
That brother look every bit of 32.

08:31.185 --> 08:32.462
He probably got a mortgage,

08:32.464 --> 08:34.254
child support payments due.

08:34.255 --> 08:35.422
That man is old.

08:35.423 --> 08:39.359
He look like second-term Barack Obama.

08:39.360 --> 08:40.727
I think he graduated with me.

08:40.727 --> 08:41.695
He's in my yearbook.

08:41.696 --> 08:43.796
Let me get my yearbook.

08:47.001 --> 08:48.535
Guess what?

08:48.536 --> 08:50.837
He bought me my favorite caramel frappe.

08:50.838 --> 08:53.273
Aw, sweetheart. That's so nice.

08:53.274 --> 08:55.675
- He's adorable.
- Oh, yeah.

08:55.676 --> 08:58.545
Um, baby, you said he helps
out with the football team?

08:58.546 --> 09:00.825
Yeah, he helps out by
throwing the ball to everyone

09:00.826 --> 09:01.880
during the game.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.586
He's the damn quarterback.

09:09.957 --> 09:12.292
I'm telling you, that boy
only got one thing on his mind.

09:12.293 --> 09:14.361
Marlon, we are right here.

09:14.362 --> 09:17.731
- Nothing is gonna happen.
- You damn right.

09:17.732 --> 09:20.333
Zack.

09:20.334 --> 09:22.802
All right, I need you
to go bug your sister.

09:22.803 --> 09:25.238
- I'm on it.
- My dude.

09:25.239 --> 09:26.706
You need to relax.

09:26.707 --> 09:28.708
He is only 15 years old.

09:28.709 --> 09:31.678
15? Do you know what I was doing at 15?

09:31.679 --> 09:34.047
15-year-old boys,
they're walking hormones.

09:34.048 --> 09:35.015
They just walk around.

09:35.016 --> 09:36.483
They just hump all day.

09:36.484 --> 09:38.685
Just... their bodies just do this.

09:38.686 --> 09:40.887
When I was 15, I would
just hump anything.

09:40.888 --> 09:43.290
Blankets, it didn't matter what it was.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.458
Look, Zack, go away.

09:45.459 --> 09:46.493
God.

09:46.494 --> 09:47.989
Uh, Eugene, do you want to go

09:47.990 --> 09:50.030
up to my room and study?

09:50.031 --> 09:51.331
It's on. That's my cue.

09:51.332 --> 09:53.566
It's time for the daddy beatdown.

09:53.567 --> 09:55.334
No, I'm cool right here, babe.

09:59.473 --> 10:00.907
Did you hear that?

10:00.908 --> 10:02.475
Oh, this is worse than we thought.

10:02.476 --> 10:05.245
We didn't think anything.

10:05.246 --> 10:06.313
Come here.

10:06.314 --> 10:08.181
Girl, look. Look at this.

10:08.182 --> 10:09.149
Come here. Look at this.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.717
Look at that man. Look...

10:10.718 --> 10:13.252
- Boy, you better get off me.
- Okay, but...

10:14.121 --> 10:15.555
Look for the circumference.

10:15.556 --> 10:16.890
This boy is diabolical.

10:16.891 --> 10:19.526
He's using her to pass the geometry test.

10:19.527 --> 10:21.594
Or maybe he's just a nice boy

10:21.595 --> 10:23.263
who enjoys our daughter's company.

10:23.264 --> 10:25.931
What? She is boring as hell.

10:29.036 --> 10:30.737
Have you seen her Snapchat?

10:30.738 --> 10:31.503
Oh, my God.

10:32.106 --> 10:34.339
I unfollowed her four months ago.

10:35.876 --> 10:37.310
Uh, excuse me, miss,

10:37.311 --> 10:38.854
can I get another Rice Krispie Treat?

10:38.855 --> 10:40.324
Those are, like, the best I ever had.

10:40.325 --> 10:42.124
Oh, sure, of course.

10:44.952 --> 10:45.952
Here you go.

10:45.953 --> 10:46.987
Thank you.

10:46.988 --> 10:48.455
See, he's harmless.

10:48.456 --> 10:49.756
Are you that blind?

10:49.757 --> 10:51.291
That man-dude just flirted with you,

10:51.292 --> 10:53.593
and you didn't even see that?

10:53.594 --> 10:54.861
He had a little sexy voice on.

10:54.862 --> 10:55.862
He's rubbing his little...

10:55.863 --> 10:57.497
his little chin hairs.

10:57.498 --> 11:02.469
"Yo, can you get me
another Rice Krispie Treat?

11:02.470 --> 11:04.738
"Like, those was the
best-est Rice Krispie Treats

11:04.739 --> 11:06.573
I ever had."

11:06.574 --> 11:08.975
Your Rice Krispie Treats are terrible.

11:08.976 --> 11:10.677
Zack!

11:10.678 --> 11:12.946
Do you like Mommy's Rice Krispie Treats?

11:12.947 --> 11:14.914
It's only three ingredients, Mom.

11:14.915 --> 11:16.383
We don't know how you screw 'em up.

11:16.384 --> 11:17.717
Thank you.

11:20.654 --> 11:21.721
Ah!

11:22.690 --> 11:25.125
Point.

11:25.126 --> 11:26.092
I've had enough.

11:26.093 --> 11:28.828
Stevie, you know

11:28.829 --> 11:30.864
how much I want that Beyoncé ticket,

11:30.865 --> 11:33.366
and you're just using me.

11:33.367 --> 11:35.435
Well, until I got the tickets,

11:35.436 --> 11:37.137
you showed no interest in me.

11:37.138 --> 11:39.572
So who, may I ask, is using whom?

11:39.573 --> 11:43.176
You know what? This isn't worth it.

11:43.177 --> 11:44.911
I'm just gonna watch it on cable

11:44.912 --> 11:47.514
while sipping a tall glass of lemonade.

11:47.515 --> 11:49.015
Do you know how many single ladies

11:49.016 --> 11:52.685
would kill for these tickets?

11:52.686 --> 11:54.954
All the single ladies.

11:54.955 --> 11:56.756
All the single ladies.

12:04.532 --> 12:06.431
That boy's gonna break her heart.

12:08.002 --> 12:10.070
- Marley?
- Oh, guess what?

12:10.071 --> 12:12.105
Eugene asked to study
here again tomorrow night,

12:12.106 --> 12:14.474
and he told me he doesn't
have a date for the dance.

12:17.878 --> 12:20.080
Here, sit.

12:20.081 --> 12:22.949
Uh, Marley, if there was a, uh,

12:22.950 --> 12:25.018
a "Harry Potter" spell

12:25.019 --> 12:27.253
that... that I can use to protect you

12:27.254 --> 12:30.256
from all the bad guys out there,

12:30.257 --> 12:31.891
you would use it, wouldn't you?

12:31.892 --> 12:34.960
Protego Maxima? Yeah, absolutely.

12:36.697 --> 12:39.466
Protego Maxima, yeah.

12:39.467 --> 12:42.836
Now I see why I unfollowed you.

12:42.837 --> 12:43.870
Well, here's the thing.

12:43.871 --> 12:46.106
There's a lot of boys your age

12:46.107 --> 12:48.508
that only want one thing from a girl.

12:48.509 --> 12:50.577
See, they want to use their little wands

12:50.578 --> 12:51.578
to slay the dragon...

12:51.579 --> 12:52.946
Marlon!

12:52.947 --> 12:54.247
Focus.

12:54.248 --> 12:55.215
Focus, right.

12:55.216 --> 12:56.950
Okay.

12:56.951 --> 12:58.585
What I'm saying is,

12:58.586 --> 13:00.353
baby, he's using you

13:00.354 --> 13:03.022
just so he can pass the math test.

13:03.023 --> 13:05.325
Wait a minute.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.066
You don't think a boy like Eugene

13:07.067 --> 13:08.207
could actually like me?

13:08.208 --> 13:10.163
No, Marley, that's not what I'm saying.

13:10.164 --> 13:12.665
Baby, I'm just trying to protect you.

13:12.666 --> 13:13.867
You know what, Dad?

13:13.868 --> 13:16.503
When he comes over tomorrow night,

13:16.504 --> 13:18.770
I'd rather you not be here.

13:24.411 --> 13:26.594
Did she just put me in timeout?

13:31.420 --> 13:32.887
Eugene's gonna be here any minute.

13:32.888 --> 13:34.363
- You should go.
- So you still think

13:34.364 --> 13:35.865
I'm wrong, don't you?

13:35.866 --> 13:38.467
Yes, I do. I think you're wrong.

13:38.468 --> 13:40.503
You don't know that
little boy's intentions.

13:40.504 --> 13:44.674
I know it's not to get
busy with my daughter.

13:44.675 --> 13:45.875
Do you hear yourself?

13:45.876 --> 13:46.842
Yes.

13:46.843 --> 13:50.446
I sound crazy as hell.

13:50.447 --> 13:53.282
And that is why she
doesn't want you here.

13:53.283 --> 13:54.417
She didn't mean that.

13:54.418 --> 13:56.584
Daddy, I don't want you here.

13:57.454 --> 13:59.488
Maybe she did mean that.

14:03.560 --> 14:05.428
Hey, what's going on, Mr. Wayne?

14:05.429 --> 14:07.195
Mm-hmm.

14:08.265 --> 14:10.332
Uh, Eugene, I forgot my geometry book.

14:10.333 --> 14:13.269
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

14:13.270 --> 14:15.371
Hi, I made you some more Rice Krispies.

14:15.372 --> 14:18.006
Oh, this looks even better
than your last batch.

14:23.046 --> 14:26.047
You better sit down, Eugene.

14:29.753 --> 14:32.054
Marlon, you were right.

14:32.055 --> 14:34.924
Eugene just looked at me over the fence.

14:34.925 --> 14:36.692
Yeah, and if you're right about that,

14:36.693 --> 14:38.594
then you might be right
about other things.

14:38.595 --> 14:41.097
You're damn right...

14:41.098 --> 14:42.898
Jesus.

14:42.899 --> 14:44.566
Let me call you right back.

14:47.537 --> 14:49.338
What are you doing here?

14:49.339 --> 14:51.373
Well, I wasn't gonna
leave my daughter alone

14:51.374 --> 14:53.642
with the geometry gigolo.

14:53.643 --> 14:56.979
So I climbed in through
your bedroom window.

14:56.980 --> 14:59.648
Marlon, I'm afraid he's
gonna break her heart.

14:59.649 --> 15:01.617
- See, that's it.
- No, no, no.

15:01.618 --> 15:03.085
You can't go down there.

15:03.086 --> 15:04.954
Then why did you call me back here?

15:04.955 --> 15:07.990
I didn't call you back
here. You broke in.

15:07.991 --> 15:10.493
- Right.
- I just wanted your support.

15:10.494 --> 15:12.261
She's gonna get hurt.

15:12.262 --> 15:16.198
This is like the training
wheels moment all over again.

15:16.199 --> 15:18.934
Exactly, and you want her
to fall and bust her ass

15:18.935 --> 15:20.236
and get stitches again?

15:20.237 --> 15:22.371
Marlon...

15:22.372 --> 15:25.808
what happened after she got the stitches?

15:25.809 --> 15:28.878
She got back up on her bike,
and she learned to ride.

15:28.879 --> 15:30.746
Exactly.

15:30.747 --> 15:32.148
Our job is to be here

15:32.149 --> 15:36.117
to dust her off and kiss her bruises.

15:38.021 --> 15:39.288
You're right.

15:39.289 --> 15:41.323
But you know when she was little,

15:41.324 --> 15:42.858
- and she'd hurt herself?
- Mm-hmm.

15:42.859 --> 15:44.693
She fell on the bike.
I'd grab the bike and say,

15:44.694 --> 15:46.495
"Bike, you so stupid,"
and I grabbed the bike,

15:46.496 --> 15:47.897
and I threw it into the tree, and I said,

15:47.898 --> 15:49.665
"Don't you hurt my daughter."

15:49.666 --> 15:52.868
That's what I want to do with the dude.

15:56.640 --> 15:58.574
Wow.

15:58.575 --> 16:01.210
You look great.

16:01.211 --> 16:02.978
I know.

16:02.979 --> 16:05.347
Beyoncé is gonna want
to pull me up onstage

16:05.348 --> 16:08.117
when she sees me dancing in this.

16:08.118 --> 16:09.819
- Just one thing before we go.
- Yeah?

16:09.820 --> 16:11.053
To get this upgrade,

16:11.054 --> 16:12.888
I kind of had to tell a little white lie,

16:12.889 --> 16:14.475
and I need you to play along with it.

16:14.476 --> 16:15.825
Oh, we're still VIP, right?

16:15.826 --> 16:17.376
Down front near the stage, right?

16:17.377 --> 16:19.895
So close she'll shower us with her sweat.

16:19.896 --> 16:20.963
For that,

16:20.964 --> 16:23.131
I'll play along with anything.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.301
Isn't this fun?

16:26.469 --> 16:29.572
I hate you, Stevie.

16:29.573 --> 16:31.874
For a girl who survived
getting hit by two buses,

16:31.875 --> 16:33.809
you got a pretty crappy attitude.

16:33.810 --> 16:35.544
Oh, I would choke you if I could just

16:35.545 --> 16:37.379
put my hands together.

16:37.380 --> 16:38.347
Oh, my God.

16:38.348 --> 16:40.382
Jay Z is on the catwalk.

16:40.383 --> 16:41.884
- Where?
- Look, look.

16:41.885 --> 16:43.451
He's going over there.

16:45.856 --> 16:48.424
So listen...

16:48.425 --> 16:50.125
I'm not really good at this school thing,

16:50.126 --> 16:51.360
and if I don't pass this test,

16:51.361 --> 16:53.095
I'm getting kicked off the football team.

16:53.096 --> 16:55.075
There's no way I'm gonna
learn this by tomorrow.

16:55.076 --> 16:58.167
So why don't you just
write out the formulas

16:58.168 --> 17:00.536
on a little piece of paper?

17:00.537 --> 17:02.271
Like a cheat sheet?

17:02.272 --> 17:03.405
Exactly.

17:03.406 --> 17:04.607
Let me just... let me just

17:04.608 --> 17:06.040
throw one of these at him, please.

17:06.041 --> 17:07.443
No, no.

17:07.444 --> 17:10.179
You'll kill him.

17:10.180 --> 17:13.015
I don't know what I do to them.

17:13.016 --> 17:14.450
Uh, so do you know

17:14.451 --> 17:16.194
who you're gonna ask to the dance yet?

17:16.195 --> 17:18.253
- Tanesha.
- Who?

17:18.255 --> 17:20.088
My girlfriend.

17:22.058 --> 17:24.126
Is this still a training wheels moment?

17:24.127 --> 17:26.060
No. That is your cue.

17:26.061 --> 17:27.796
Time for daddy beatdown.

17:27.797 --> 17:30.132
Oh, this is what I've been waiting for.

17:30.133 --> 17:32.801
Whoo!

17:32.802 --> 17:37.740
Ooh!

17:37.741 --> 17:39.775
Let me holler at you real quick, playboy.

17:39.776 --> 17:40.743
Daddy...

17:40.744 --> 17:42.311
First of all, Eugene,

17:42.312 --> 17:44.380
you got a very misleading moniker.

17:44.381 --> 17:46.148
Okay, if you're going
to have a nerd's name,

17:46.149 --> 17:47.783
then you should be a damn nerd.

17:47.784 --> 17:49.808
Quarterbacks are supposed to
have cool, white-boy names,

17:49.809 --> 17:52.388
like Brett, or Chaz, or Dean,

17:52.389 --> 17:56.058
or Ace, or Chip.

17:56.059 --> 17:58.594
And secondly, I don't
want you coming around here

17:58.595 --> 18:00.329
with your grown face,

18:00.330 --> 18:02.965
your LeBron James cheekbones,

18:02.966 --> 18:05.234
your Robert Griffin III eyes,

18:05.235 --> 18:07.469
thumb-sucking but still grown,

18:07.470 --> 18:09.271
with your little pretzel lips,

18:09.272 --> 18:12.141
and your Grover from "Sesame Street" naps

18:12.142 --> 18:14.043
after he'd been wet for three days

18:14.044 --> 18:16.078
and sat out and let him dry back up.

18:16.079 --> 18:18.280
With your half-man, half-kid body.

18:18.281 --> 18:20.182
You look strange with your sexy,

18:20.183 --> 18:22.718
evil Trey Songz intentions.

18:22.719 --> 18:24.987
And thirdly, I don't want
you coming around my house,

18:24.988 --> 18:26.422
messing with my daughter anymore.

18:26.423 --> 18:27.589
You understand me?

18:27.590 --> 18:29.959
Look, man, I got when I came for.

18:29.960 --> 18:31.460
See you around, Marley.

18:31.461 --> 18:32.795
You got what you came for?

18:32.796 --> 18:35.230
Oh, you...

18:40.537 --> 18:44.306
You... oh, you got what you came for?

18:46.376 --> 18:48.043
Oh, you know what?

18:48.044 --> 18:50.646
I'm gonna set my alarm
for three years from now,

18:50.647 --> 18:52.281
and on his 18th birthday,

18:52.282 --> 18:53.869
I'm gonna show up at Dave & Busters,

18:53.870 --> 18:55.426
and he going to be playing Skee-Ball,

18:55.427 --> 18:57.186
and when that ball go up like that there,

18:57.187 --> 19:00.089
I'm gonna come in and pow!

19:00.090 --> 19:01.913
I'm gonna punch him right in his chest.

19:01.914 --> 19:03.261
He'll be like...

19:03.262 --> 19:04.226
500 points.

19:06.963 --> 19:08.434
You know what I'm gonna
do? I'm gonna get me

19:08.435 --> 19:09.865
a hyperbaric chamber,

19:09.866 --> 19:11.594
and I'm gonna lie there for three years

19:11.595 --> 19:13.002
and preserve my youth,

19:13.003 --> 19:14.493
and then them doors gonna open...

19:16.973 --> 19:18.574
And pow!

19:18.575 --> 19:20.142
Punch him right in the face.

19:20.143 --> 19:22.911
And if I miss, I'm gonna
play asleep like this here.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.112
And I'm gonna have an alien...

19:25.015 --> 19:26.115
Bust out my chest...

19:27.117 --> 19:28.484
And jump on his face.

19:30.453 --> 19:33.389
And I'm just gonna sit
there and let him suffocate.

19:33.390 --> 19:34.723
Not to death.

19:34.724 --> 19:36.324
Then I take one of
your Rice Krispie Treats

19:36.325 --> 19:39.461
and go, "Get off of him."

19:39.462 --> 19:42.731
Nobody messes with my baby.

19:42.732 --> 19:44.166
I'm not a baby. I'm 14.

19:44.167 --> 19:45.667
I can handle myself.

19:45.668 --> 19:48.737
Marley, when a dude is
using you to pass a test,

19:48.738 --> 19:50.506
you don't give him a cheat sheet.

19:50.507 --> 19:53.509
- He's not passing that test.
- What?

19:53.510 --> 19:56.011
All the formulas I
gave him? They're wrong.

19:56.012 --> 19:58.881
So he'll be off the football
team by Monday morning.

20:03.219 --> 20:04.453
Wow.

20:04.454 --> 20:06.789
He was cute, though.

20:06.790 --> 20:10.926
Girl, he was a'ight.

20:10.927 --> 20:13.529
Listen, Marley.

20:13.530 --> 20:15.097
I learned something.

20:15.098 --> 20:17.148
You're not a baby anymore,

20:19.275 --> 20:21.041
and that's kinda of scary for me.

20:21.250 --> 20:23.135
One day you're going to meet a boy

20:23.136 --> 20:25.104
who likes you and appreciates you

20:25.105 --> 20:27.239
for everything that you are.

20:27.240 --> 20:28.874
And you know what?

20:28.875 --> 20:30.242
Daddy's gonna bury his ass

20:30.243 --> 20:32.143
right there in the backyard.

20:34.914 --> 20:36.882
- Hugs?
- Mm-mm.

20:36.883 --> 20:39.818
Oh, you're gonna Jackie
Chan this hug too?

20:39.819 --> 20:41.786
Not this one.

20:48.895 --> 20:50.729
Uh, you guys?

20:50.730 --> 20:52.330
Yeah, it's weird. You made it weird.

20:55.689 --> 21:01.944
