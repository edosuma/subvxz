00:19.954 --> 00:21.121
When you call me
back on Wednesday,

00:21.123 --> 00:23.890
just ask for me directly, okay?

00:24.725 --> 00:25.725
Okay.

00:27.161 --> 00:28.128
All right, I'll
talk to you then.

00:28.130 --> 00:28.895
See ya.

00:28.897 --> 00:30.230
Bye.

00:30.232 --> 00:32.332
Amanda, I was just
talking about you.

00:32.334 --> 00:33.299
Oh, really?

00:33.301 --> 00:34.134
You find something for me?

00:34.136 --> 00:35.468
Actually, no.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.004
I was just talking to Jim

00:38.006 --> 00:41.307
about how difficult it's
been to get you in anywhere.

00:41.309 --> 00:42.909
There's gotta be something.

00:42.911 --> 00:44.210
It's just this job market.

00:44.212 --> 00:45.645
It is over saturated.

00:45.647 --> 00:47.580
The jobs that you would
normally go for and land,

00:47.582 --> 00:48.815
they're just being
snatched up by folks

00:48.817 --> 00:51.317
who are overqualified
to begin with.

00:51.319 --> 00:53.686
At least have high
school diplomas.

00:53.688 --> 00:54.654
So what are you saying?

00:54.656 --> 00:56.056
I should go back to high school?

00:56.058 --> 00:58.858
No, I'm just saying that
getting a Ged wouldn't hurt.

00:58.860 --> 01:01.728
I don't need a
Ged, I need a job.

01:01.730 --> 01:02.730
Mark...

01:03.531 --> 01:04.864
I can't lean on my mom anymore.

01:04.866 --> 01:08.568
She can barely pay
the bills as it is.

01:08.570 --> 01:10.437
She's gonna kick me out.

01:10.439 --> 01:11.838
Oh, I know.

01:11.840 --> 01:13.740
Just keep showing up, okay,
and keep on those classifieds.

01:13.742 --> 01:15.675
Something is gonna
happen, I promise,

01:15.677 --> 01:19.245
and when it does, I'll
give you a call, okay?

01:19.247 --> 01:20.247
Yeah.

01:21.082 --> 01:22.348
Okay.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.217
Keep your chin up.

01:24.219 --> 01:25.018
Yeah.

01:25.020 --> 01:26.020
Thanks.

01:53.048 --> 01:54.647
The Oregon hotel.

01:54.649 --> 01:56.883
Hi, this is Amanda Millard.

01:56.885 --> 02:00.787
I think I missed a phone call
regarding a hotel position.

02:00.789 --> 02:02.789
Honey, I received
your Résumé in the mail

02:02.791 --> 02:04.390
the other day, and
I was wondering

02:04.392 --> 02:05.758
if you could drop by.

02:05.760 --> 02:10.330
I'd love to meet you, and
talk about a position.

02:10.332 --> 02:11.931
Okay, where did you
say you're calling from?

02:11.933 --> 02:13.333
I don't recall sending...

02:13.335 --> 02:15.502
The Oregon hotel in Mitchell.

02:16.838 --> 02:19.506
Don't tell me you've
never been to Mitchell.

02:19.508 --> 02:20.974
I can't say I have.

02:20.976 --> 02:22.775
I did send a bunch of
resumes out last week,

02:22.777 --> 02:26.613
but I don't recall sending
anything to Mitchell.

02:26.615 --> 02:28.748
Well, Fred,
who owns the royal lodge,

02:28.750 --> 02:30.083
he sent it to me.

02:30.085 --> 02:32.085
He knew I was looking
for someone like you.

02:32.087 --> 02:33.920
Oh, okay.

02:33.922 --> 02:35.255
So, how do I get there?

02:35.257 --> 02:38.858
Just take highway
26 out through Prineville,

02:38.860 --> 02:41.961
and we're about 80 miles east
through the painted hills.

02:41.963 --> 02:42.963
80 miles?

02:44.832 --> 02:46.199
Can you give me a few hours?

02:46.201 --> 02:47.834
There's a few things I
need to take care of.

02:47.836 --> 02:49.969
Oh, of course,
I'm here all the time.

02:49.971 --> 02:51.337
See you then.

02:51.339 --> 02:52.205
Great.

02:52.207 --> 02:54.607
What was your name?

02:54.609 --> 02:55.609
Hello.

02:57.344 --> 02:58.344
Okay.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.589
Well, tell Daryl to
tell Stacy to back off.

04:49.591 --> 04:51.457
Because it's his mess.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.093
Well, you should.

04:54.095 --> 04:56.763
It's his mess,
he's gotta fix it.

04:56.765 --> 04:59.332
Well, tell him to fix it.

04:59.334 --> 05:04.103
I don't know why you're making
such a big deal out of that.

05:04.105 --> 05:07.073
Well, then just don't
talk to Stacy then.

05:07.075 --> 05:10.109
Bring him over here, I'll tell
him to make Stacy back off.

05:10.111 --> 05:11.177
In a minute.

05:12.146 --> 05:13.146
Oh, no.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.181
Mm-mmm.

05:16.083 --> 05:18.418
That girl cannot
get away with it.

05:18.420 --> 05:19.852
Yeah, exactly.

05:19.854 --> 05:20.953
Can I talk to you a moment?

05:20.955 --> 05:22.488
Julie, I'm gonna have
to have you pause it.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.490
I'm gonna call you right back.

05:24.492 --> 05:27.160
Because Amanda's
here buggin' me.

05:27.162 --> 05:28.695
All right.

05:28.697 --> 05:30.530
I will call you right back.

05:30.532 --> 05:31.331
What?

05:31.333 --> 05:32.932
I got a job interview,

05:32.934 --> 05:36.502
but I need to borrow
like 20 bucks for gas.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.008
Amanda, you are bleeding me dry.

05:42.010 --> 05:43.609
How much longer do I
have to support you?

05:43.611 --> 05:44.977
Well, how am I
supposed to pay you back

05:44.979 --> 05:46.846
if I don't get a job?

05:46.848 --> 05:48.147
You're unemployment.

05:48.149 --> 05:50.016
Mom, that was up two weeks ago.

05:50.018 --> 05:51.050
It's like 20 dollars.

05:51.052 --> 05:51.851
God damn it.

05:51.853 --> 05:52.685
Fine!

05:52.687 --> 05:54.120
I'm so over this dame.

05:54.122 --> 05:55.388
She's gonna...

05:55.390 --> 05:56.456
God damn it.

05:56.458 --> 05:58.491
Look at what you made me do.

05:58.493 --> 05:59.692
I'll clean it up.

05:59.694 --> 06:01.027
Stop, you're
gonna make it worse.

06:01.029 --> 06:01.828
Take the money.

06:01.830 --> 06:02.628
Go.

06:02.630 --> 06:03.630
I got it.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.065
Son of a bitch.

06:07.134 --> 06:08.768
Whole glass of wine.

07:36.490 --> 07:37.490
Hello.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.131
Hello.

07:55.476 --> 07:56.476
Hello.

08:03.917 --> 08:04.951
Jesus.

08:04.953 --> 08:05.852
I'm sorry, honey.

08:05.854 --> 08:07.086
I didn't mean to frighten you.

08:07.088 --> 08:08.855
I'm Mildred Colvin.

08:08.857 --> 08:10.790
You call me Millie,
everybody does.

08:10.792 --> 08:12.592
So nice to meet you.

08:12.594 --> 08:14.160
I can't tell you how happy I am

08:14.162 --> 08:17.530
that you were able to
come on such short notice.

08:17.532 --> 08:19.799
It's a sign of a real go getter.

08:19.801 --> 08:21.033
Yeah.

08:21.035 --> 08:22.635
So, what do you think
of our little town?

08:22.637 --> 08:24.337
Well, it's little.

08:24.339 --> 08:27.106
It's not exactly
elaborate, but, I don't know,

08:27.108 --> 08:30.042
people just seem to
love to come here.

08:30.044 --> 08:33.145
We do try to keep it like
it was in the old days,

08:33.147 --> 08:35.214
with modern
amenities, of course.

08:35.216 --> 08:36.282
Right.

08:36.284 --> 08:38.150
Well, I'll show you upstairs.

08:38.152 --> 08:39.318
Go ahead.

08:39.320 --> 08:40.320
Okay.

08:47.728 --> 08:49.362
I think I heard somebody
up here earlier.

08:49.364 --> 08:51.330
Oh, that was
probably my son, Billy.

08:51.332 --> 08:53.232
He's around here all the time,

08:53.234 --> 08:55.468
just never where I want him.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.804
This is nice and neat
and tidy little room.

08:58.806 --> 09:00.072
So cute.

09:00.074 --> 09:02.308
It's very masculine,
kind of a hunter's room.

09:02.310 --> 09:04.744
Here we have number seven,

09:04.746 --> 09:07.013
where the great
Clark gables slept.

09:07.015 --> 09:08.581
Oh, who's that?

09:08.583 --> 09:10.016
Oh.

09:10.018 --> 09:11.018
Never mind.

09:12.553 --> 09:14.554
And this would be your room.

09:14.556 --> 09:16.756
That is if you're
interested in the job.

09:16.758 --> 09:20.226
We keep it vacant
for special guests.

09:20.228 --> 09:22.228
So, I can stay here?

09:22.230 --> 09:24.363
Oh, honey, you don't
wanna be driving 160 miles

09:24.365 --> 09:26.866
back and forth everyday, do you?

09:26.868 --> 09:28.234
No, not really.

09:28.236 --> 09:30.903
And I could definitely use
a break from my mother.

09:30.905 --> 09:34.040
Oh, well, mother's can
be overbearing sometimes.

09:34.042 --> 09:38.878
Yes, overbearing and over
drunk and over everything.

09:38.880 --> 09:42.448
Oh, this might work
out for both of us then.

09:42.450 --> 09:43.450
Yeah.

09:44.451 --> 09:45.551
Well, let's have
a cup of coffee,

09:45.553 --> 09:48.387
and fill out some paper forms.

09:48.389 --> 09:49.422
Sounds good.

09:52.359 --> 09:53.859
Oh honey, don't bother
filling out all of that.

09:53.861 --> 09:58.197
I just need your emergency
contact information.

09:58.199 --> 09:59.265
Little refill here.

09:59.267 --> 10:01.934
Thank you.

10:01.936 --> 10:03.269
I'm so excited.

10:04.771 --> 10:07.206
If I had known I was gonna find
someone like you so quickly,

10:07.208 --> 10:09.375
I'd a done this a long time ago.

10:09.377 --> 10:12.278
Okay, I think,
I think that's it.

10:12.280 --> 10:13.646
Can you start tomorrow?

10:13.648 --> 10:16.215
Yeah, I'll go home
tonight and pack,

10:16.217 --> 10:17.750
and I'll be back in the morning.

10:17.752 --> 10:18.752
Perfect.

10:20.221 --> 10:21.954
Oh, got something for you to do.

10:21.956 --> 10:22.822
Hold on.

10:22.824 --> 10:23.824
Wait.

10:26.927 --> 10:30.296
This is a little advance,
'cause you're gonna need it.

10:30.298 --> 10:32.598
You're gonna need gas
and all that stuff.

10:32.600 --> 10:34.333
You don't have to do that.

10:34.335 --> 10:35.735
Honey, I know what it's like

10:35.737 --> 10:37.937
to be a young woman
in your shoes.

10:37.939 --> 10:39.905
So, I understand.

10:39.907 --> 10:40.673
Thank you.

10:40.675 --> 10:41.675
Okay.

10:44.411 --> 10:47.913
But come back or I'll
come looking for you.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.316
And careful driving home.

10:50.318 --> 10:51.417
I will.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.053
I'll see you tomorrow.

10:55.288 --> 10:58.391
And watch out for
them god damn deer.

11:26.787 --> 11:27.787
Why now?

11:49.409 --> 11:50.409
Jesus fuck.

11:51.645 --> 11:54.046
Need some gas, 'cause I got
some gas if you want some.

11:54.048 --> 11:55.014
Jesus Christ.

11:55.016 --> 11:56.515
What the fuck is wrong with you?

11:56.517 --> 11:58.384
Just trying to help.

12:00.687 --> 12:01.487
No, no.

12:01.489 --> 12:03.189
I'm sorry.

12:03.191 --> 12:05.324
This town is creepy
enough as it is.

12:05.326 --> 12:06.459
Billy Colvin.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.528
Oh, you're Billy.

12:09.530 --> 12:10.663
Millie's Billy.

12:12.432 --> 12:13.432
Sorry.

12:14.501 --> 12:17.036
You know, I can have you
towed to the service station,

12:17.038 --> 12:18.504
and I can take a look at it.

12:18.506 --> 12:21.340
I'm not out of gas, 'cause
I filled it up this afternoon.

12:21.342 --> 12:25.511
Like I said, I can
have a look at it.

12:25.513 --> 12:29.348
I guess I don't have
many options now, do I?

12:39.926 --> 12:41.460
What on earth?

12:41.462 --> 12:44.430
Oh, my car died down the road.

12:44.432 --> 12:47.733
Oh, get in here before
you catch a death of cold.

12:47.735 --> 12:49.068
I'm sorry.

12:49.070 --> 12:50.035
I don't know
what's wrong with it.

12:50.037 --> 12:51.971
It's been running fine.

12:51.973 --> 12:53.372
But it's a good thing

12:53.374 --> 12:54.707
you didn't get further
down the road, honey.

12:54.709 --> 12:55.808
You could've gotten
stuck out there all night

12:55.810 --> 12:57.309
on that dark highway.

12:57.311 --> 12:58.544
Billy, how many
times have I told you

12:58.546 --> 13:01.247
not to come in here with
those dirty boots on?

13:01.249 --> 13:03.449
Oh, well, thank
god Billy showed up.

13:03.451 --> 13:04.784
Well, kind of.

13:04.786 --> 13:07.319
I didn't mean to scare
her, mother, I promise.

13:07.321 --> 13:08.120
Oh, no no.

13:08.122 --> 13:09.054
He was fine.

13:09.056 --> 13:09.789
It was just, I was startled.

13:09.791 --> 13:11.390
He'd startle anybody.

13:11.392 --> 13:13.092
He'd startle a ghost.

13:13.094 --> 13:14.493
Looks like the grim reaper.

13:14.495 --> 13:15.928
I'm sorry.

13:15.930 --> 13:19.298
He said he could tow my car
up here and take a look at it.

13:19.300 --> 13:20.332
Well, what are you
waiting for, Billy?

13:20.334 --> 13:21.834
Go get her car.

13:21.836 --> 13:23.402
And you come with
me, young lady.

13:23.404 --> 13:26.906
We're gonna get you some
coffee and get you warmed up.

13:26.908 --> 13:29.008
That's cool that
Billy could tow my car.

13:29.010 --> 13:30.676
Oh, Billy's a sweet boy.

13:30.678 --> 13:32.758
He just doesn't know how to
behave around the ladies.

13:33.748 --> 13:35.347
He takes after his father.

13:35.349 --> 13:37.583
Oh, he seems like
a very nice man.

13:37.585 --> 13:39.018
Well, he is,

13:39.020 --> 13:43.255
and I'll show ya, he
had a very nice girl.

13:43.257 --> 13:46.025
She worked here
for a short time.

13:46.027 --> 13:48.961
Thought they were
gonna get hitched,

13:48.963 --> 13:51.497
but some handsome
dude came through here

13:51.499 --> 13:53.999
and that was the end of her.

13:55.502 --> 13:56.802
That's terrible.

13:56.804 --> 13:58.170
Yeah.

13:58.172 --> 13:59.772
She about broke his heart.

13:59.774 --> 14:00.774
Mine too.

14:02.108 --> 14:04.610
I really liked that girl.

14:04.612 --> 14:05.511
Oh well.

14:05.513 --> 14:06.545
Oh.

14:06.547 --> 14:07.813
Enough of her.

14:07.815 --> 14:09.515
Wouldn't of worked out anyway.

14:09.517 --> 14:11.450
Oh, Millie, you never know.

14:11.452 --> 14:13.786
There's always somebody
out there for everyone.

14:13.788 --> 14:15.521
Yes, but out there is
where they're at, honey.

14:15.523 --> 14:16.622
Not here.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.825
I often wonder sometimes
what would happen

14:19.827 --> 14:23.896
if Billy's father hadn't
moved us out here.

14:23.898 --> 14:25.397
What did he do?

14:25.399 --> 14:26.465
Professionally, I mean.

14:26.467 --> 14:28.634
Oh, he was a doctor.

14:28.636 --> 14:30.035
That's what he started out as.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.470
We met in college.

14:31.472 --> 14:34.073
He had a very fine
practice in the city,

14:34.075 --> 14:38.010
and then his folks died
and left us this property

14:38.012 --> 14:41.580
and he decided to retire
and move us out here.

14:41.582 --> 14:42.748
What happened to your husband?

14:42.750 --> 14:44.016
If you don't mind me asking.

14:44.018 --> 14:45.018
Oh no.

14:45.919 --> 14:48.754
Frank, he died
about 15 years ago.

14:50.590 --> 14:53.058
Stupid fool fell off the roof.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.493
Oh my god.

14:54.495 --> 14:57.997
Well, I told him to hire a
gutter man to clean 'em out,

14:57.999 --> 15:01.600
but, oh no, he's a
stubborn, stubborn man.

15:02.903 --> 15:04.637
Are you happy here?

15:05.839 --> 15:09.909
Gets a little lonely,
but Billy and I do okay.

15:09.911 --> 15:14.046
But you're gonna be a great
addition to the family.

15:14.048 --> 15:15.781
Egg salad sound good?

15:15.783 --> 15:17.716
Yeah, that sounds fine.

15:17.718 --> 15:20.052
I'm gonna go call
my mom, let her know

15:20.054 --> 15:21.253
that I'm not coming home tonight

15:21.255 --> 15:23.022
so she won't freak.

15:23.024 --> 15:24.857
Not that she'll notice.

15:24.859 --> 15:25.859
Okay.

15:26.526 --> 15:27.927
Hey, it's me.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.630
I had car troubles
out her in Mitchell,

15:31.632 --> 15:32.865
but they're working on it now,

15:32.867 --> 15:35.701
so I'll probably
be back tomorrow.

15:37.037 --> 15:40.039
All right, I'll
talk to you then.

15:40.041 --> 15:41.041
Bye.

15:43.643 --> 15:46.278
I'll tell you one
thing about that boy.

15:46.280 --> 15:50.549
He's as good a mechanic as
his father was a doctor.

15:51.885 --> 15:53.252
You must be starving.

15:53.254 --> 15:54.553
Sandwiches are ready.

15:54.555 --> 15:55.654
I am.

16:04.731 --> 16:05.497
Thank you.

16:05.499 --> 16:06.499
Okay.

16:09.769 --> 16:12.404
I don't wanna be
a bad influence,

16:12.406 --> 16:16.909
but how would you like to
join me in a little touch.

16:16.911 --> 16:18.277
I did not take you as a drinker.

16:20.681 --> 16:23.582
There's a lot of things about
me that might surprise you.

16:23.584 --> 16:24.584
Great.

16:30.824 --> 16:31.824
Thank you.

16:36.363 --> 16:37.997
To our new member.

16:37.999 --> 16:38.999
Cheers.

16:48.308 --> 16:50.576
So, where's your father?

16:52.679 --> 16:54.279
I wish I knew.

16:54.281 --> 16:56.315
He left when I was little.

16:56.317 --> 16:58.050
My mom is really
hard to deal with.

16:58.052 --> 17:00.285
Actually, she's a bitch.

17:00.287 --> 17:01.687
Ooh, that's not
a very nice thing

17:01.689 --> 17:02.988
to say about your mother.

17:02.990 --> 17:04.723
But I can't hate
him for leaving,

17:04.724 --> 17:09.161
because it's the only thing
I've wanted to do for years.

17:09.163 --> 17:11.563
So what do you think
made her so unhappy?

17:11.565 --> 17:12.897
Not sure.

17:12.900 --> 17:16.635
She's never been sober long
enough to figure it out.

17:16.637 --> 17:19.505
Well, it's a crying shame
she doesn't appreciate

17:19.507 --> 17:21.807
a beautiful daughter
like yourself.

17:21.809 --> 17:24.009
Awe Millie, you're so sweet.

17:24.011 --> 17:25.011
Oh.

17:26.046 --> 17:28.247
Not as sweet as this
Kentucky sour mash.

17:28.249 --> 17:29.181
Here.

17:29.183 --> 17:30.149
Add this up here a little bit.

17:30.151 --> 17:30.916
All right, all right.

17:30.918 --> 17:32.217
There we go.

17:34.821 --> 17:35.888
Cheers.

17:35.890 --> 17:37.923
Cheers, bottoms up.

17:58.079 --> 17:59.278
Oh, my god.

18:01.014 --> 18:02.848
Oh, well, young lady,

18:02.850 --> 18:05.851
where did you learn
to drink like that?

18:05.853 --> 18:07.786
Oh my god, what time is it?

18:07.788 --> 18:09.621
It's almost 9:30.

18:10.757 --> 18:11.857
Millie, I'm so sorry.

18:11.859 --> 18:13.792
I don't drink like that ever.

18:13.794 --> 18:14.726
Like ever.

18:14.728 --> 18:15.928
I don't know what got into me.

18:15.930 --> 18:17.596
Honey, not to worry.

18:17.598 --> 18:19.698
We girls have gotta have a
good time once in a while.

18:19.700 --> 18:21.300
I went down to the general store

18:21.302 --> 18:23.602
and I got you a toothbrush
and a few other things.

18:23.604 --> 18:25.804
Thank you so much.

18:25.806 --> 18:27.806
Do you know if
Billy fixed my car?

18:27.808 --> 18:29.875
Oh yes, he had to go
into town for a part,

18:29.877 --> 18:31.944
but he'll be right back.

18:31.946 --> 18:33.445
Why don't you get
a nice hot shower

18:33.447 --> 18:35.314
and I'll fix you
a good breakfast?

18:35.316 --> 18:36.748
Thank you, that sounds perfect.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.350
Good.

18:52.465 --> 18:53.465
Shit.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.005
Shit.

19:08.148 --> 19:09.815
Come in.

19:10.817 --> 19:11.850
Hey Millie.

19:11.852 --> 19:12.784
Hi.

19:12.786 --> 19:13.852
I need to run to a store.

19:13.854 --> 19:14.786
Oh, what do you need, honey?

19:14.788 --> 19:16.655
Oh, aunt Flo showed up.

19:16.657 --> 19:17.990
Excuse...

19:17.992 --> 19:20.359
Oh I haven't
heard that term in years.

19:20.361 --> 19:22.094
It's just down the
block on the left.

19:22.096 --> 19:25.797
Oh, the shower, I
couldn't get it to drain.

19:25.799 --> 19:26.765
Oh, that again.

19:26.767 --> 19:27.599
I'll call the plumber.

19:27.601 --> 19:28.367
Sorry.

19:28.369 --> 19:29.168
Okay, thank you.

19:29.170 --> 19:31.703
Mm-hmm.

19:31.705 --> 19:33.272
Oh shit.

19:33.274 --> 19:34.274
Damn eggs.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.905
Can I help you find somethin'?

20:06.907 --> 20:08.073
No, thanks.

20:19.852 --> 20:21.420
No party tonight, huh?

20:21.422 --> 20:23.755
That's a fucked up thing to say.

20:23.757 --> 20:24.556
How much?

20:24.558 --> 20:25.558
4.99.

20:27.093 --> 20:28.794
Keep the change.

20:37.036 --> 20:38.036
Hey girl.

20:39.072 --> 20:40.072
What's up?

20:41.374 --> 20:42.574
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

20:42.576 --> 20:44.243
Easy, easy.

20:44.245 --> 20:45.611
You're new around here.

20:45.613 --> 20:47.012
Yeah, I'm new around here.

20:47.014 --> 20:48.380
Now, could you
get out of my way?

20:48.382 --> 20:50.048
I'm sorry, I'm not
trying to bother ya.

20:50.050 --> 20:52.117
You know, just not very many
people to talk to around here.

20:52.119 --> 20:53.752
I'm Brad, I'm the cook here.

20:53.754 --> 20:55.254
Yeah, I wouldn't have guessed.

20:55.256 --> 20:57.089
Nice to meet you, Brad.

20:57.091 --> 20:58.257
Can I buy you lunch?

20:58.259 --> 21:00.259
What's your name?

21:00.261 --> 21:01.261
Amanda.

21:02.061 --> 21:03.061
Damn.

21:11.604 --> 21:12.404
Ooh.

21:12.406 --> 21:13.538
Sorry, shit.

21:13.540 --> 21:14.673
I mean sorry.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.476
Easy, easy dear.

21:17.478 --> 21:19.911
Oh, I see you've
met pastor Hastings.

21:19.913 --> 21:21.413
Pastor, oh my god.

21:21.415 --> 21:24.082
It's okay, honey.

21:24.084 --> 21:26.885
Pastor Ben is also
our local plumber.

21:26.887 --> 21:28.453
Well, small town like this,

21:28.455 --> 21:31.056
we all have to wear many hats.

21:31.058 --> 21:32.557
Ben, meet Amanda.

21:32.559 --> 21:33.992
She's my new employee.

21:33.994 --> 21:35.394
Ah, well, glad to
see you're sharing

21:35.396 --> 21:37.062
one of your haves, Millie.

21:37.064 --> 21:38.964
Nice to meet you, Amanda.

21:38.966 --> 21:41.400
Oh, honey, come
on, use my bathroom.

21:41.402 --> 21:42.402
Sorry.

21:49.342 --> 21:51.510
Did you get
everything handled okay?

21:51.512 --> 21:53.712
Weird, it just stopped.

21:54.947 --> 21:57.015
Oh, Billy's got
your car running.

21:57.017 --> 21:57.816
Oh really?

21:57.818 --> 21:58.818
Yes.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.155
Billy, you fixed it.

22:03.157 --> 22:05.023
I told you he would.

22:05.025 --> 22:06.491
I don't know how to thank you.

22:06.493 --> 22:10.128
I topped off the gas
tank for you a little too.

22:10.130 --> 22:12.097
Now, here's your breakfast.

22:12.099 --> 22:13.131
Get yourself on the road,

22:13.133 --> 22:15.100
and I can do without
you one more day.

22:15.102 --> 22:19.004
I will be back bright
and early in the morning.

22:19.006 --> 22:20.006
Thank you.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.008
Drive safe.

22:24.310 --> 22:27.112
Hey Billy, you're my hero.

22:35.521 --> 22:39.157
That's a very nice girl, Billy.

22:39.159 --> 22:40.058
If I didn't know better,

22:40.060 --> 22:42.394
I'd say she kind of likes you.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.148
Jesus Christ.

23:11.057 --> 23:13.558
Hey girl, what is up?

23:13.560 --> 23:15.594
Guess who got a job.

23:15.596 --> 23:16.561
No way.

23:16.563 --> 23:17.863
Where'd you find a job?

23:17.865 --> 23:19.431
Some hotel out in Mitchell.

23:19.433 --> 23:20.399
Where the hell is that?

23:20.401 --> 23:21.767
Exactly.

23:21.769 --> 23:22.834
Okay, hold on a second.

23:22.836 --> 23:24.169
Donna, I'm gonna take my break.

23:24.171 --> 23:26.405
Will you drop us some fries?

23:27.607 --> 23:30.108
So, tell me about this job.

23:30.110 --> 23:31.343
Well, it's actually
kind of perfect.

23:31.345 --> 23:34.079
I have my own room,
it's full time, it's...

23:34.081 --> 23:36.081
Wait, wait, so you're
staying out there?

23:36.083 --> 23:39.217
Yeah, at least until I find
something closer to town.

23:39.219 --> 23:41.420
What does your
mom say about that?

23:41.422 --> 23:44.055
I haven't told her yet.

23:44.057 --> 23:44.890
Here you go, Brittany.

23:44.892 --> 23:45.690
Thanks Kim.

23:45.692 --> 23:46.925
Thank you.

23:46.927 --> 23:49.194
That is gonna go over
like a shit balloon,

23:49.196 --> 23:49.961
and you know it.

23:49.963 --> 23:50.762
I know.

23:50.764 --> 23:52.063
I don't care.

23:52.065 --> 23:54.065
She's so busy fucking
dudes and drinking,

23:54.067 --> 23:55.700
she doesn't even know I'm gone.

23:55.702 --> 23:58.036
Yeah, but when
am I gonna see you?

23:58.038 --> 23:59.304
Well, that's the great thing.

23:59.306 --> 24:01.106
You can come out on the
weekends, you can stay with me.

24:01.108 --> 24:03.909
We can clean rooms, make beds.

24:03.911 --> 24:06.111
Wow, that sounds
amazing, Amanda.

24:06.113 --> 24:07.212
Shut up.

24:08.915 --> 24:09.781
It'll be good.

24:09.783 --> 24:10.949
Yeah, okay.

24:12.051 --> 24:12.818
I'd do it for you.

24:12.820 --> 24:14.219
I know.

24:49.088 --> 24:52.090
Where the hell are you goin'?

24:52.092 --> 24:56.361
I got that job,
so I'm leaving for a while.

24:57.163 --> 24:59.097
Wait, what's a while?

25:00.433 --> 25:04.436
You're not
even gonna know I'm gone.

25:04.438 --> 25:06.872
Are you saying
you're moving out?

25:06.874 --> 25:09.241
I'm saying I gotta go, mom.

25:13.012 --> 25:13.845
Fine!

25:13.847 --> 25:15.046
Leave!

25:15.048 --> 25:16.681
Leave just like everybody else!

25:16.683 --> 25:18.550
Just like your father!

25:19.385 --> 25:20.385
Leave!

25:20.387 --> 25:22.854
Leave just like everybody else!

26:04.931 --> 26:07.098
Oh honey, let me do this.

26:07.100 --> 26:09.734
You haven't had a day
off since you got here.

26:09.736 --> 26:12.037
Well, there's not much
to do besides the work.

26:12.039 --> 26:14.272
Well, you can go to the
creek and do something.

26:14.274 --> 26:16.007
It's okay, I think
I'd rather just...

26:16.009 --> 26:18.176
Look, I'm the boss,
and the boss says

26:18.178 --> 26:20.245
you're gonna take the day off.

26:20.247 --> 26:21.947
Okay, fine boss.

26:23.049 --> 26:24.749
I guess I could go to the Café.

26:24.751 --> 26:26.217
That cook offered
to buy me lunch.

26:26.219 --> 26:27.452
No, no no.

26:27.454 --> 26:28.386
You don't wanna go
there, you just get sick.

26:28.388 --> 26:31.222
I think his name is Brad.

26:31.224 --> 26:33.058
I'll fix you something.

26:33.060 --> 26:34.292

26:56.249 --> 26:57.115
Absolutely.

26:57.117 --> 26:58.149
Anything you'd like.

26:58.151 --> 26:59.384
Well, you're the chef.

26:59.386 --> 27:00.386
Surprise me.

27:02.421 --> 27:04.289
I'm thinking a French cuisine.

27:04.291 --> 27:06.124
Ooh, like quiche?

27:07.893 --> 27:10.228
More like French
dip and French fries.

27:10.230 --> 27:11.229
Seriously?

27:11.231 --> 27:12.797
Seriously.

27:12.799 --> 27:13.832
That's fine.

27:13.834 --> 27:14.899
All right.

27:16.302 --> 27:18.403
So how's it goin' over there?

27:18.405 --> 27:19.771
Everything's fine.

27:19.773 --> 27:21.072
Yeah.

27:21.074 --> 27:21.806
Except for don't
you think it's weird

27:21.808 --> 27:22.741
that no one comes here.

27:22.743 --> 27:23.642
I've been here for three weeks,

27:23.644 --> 27:26.311
and we barely had any customers.

27:26.313 --> 27:27.612
I don't know how she makes it.

27:27.614 --> 27:29.147
Mildred?

27:29.149 --> 27:31.182
That old bitch doesn't
need to make anything.

27:31.184 --> 27:32.283
What do you mean?

27:32.285 --> 27:33.485
Well, I mean since
her husband died,

27:33.487 --> 27:34.986
he left her a fortune.

27:34.988 --> 27:37.522
I thought he fell off a roof.

27:38.658 --> 27:40.258
Pushed is more like it.

27:40.260 --> 27:41.826
Nobody could prove it, but,

27:41.828 --> 27:44.362
word is Billy saw the
whole damn thing go down.

27:44.364 --> 27:45.764
Billy tell you that?

27:45.766 --> 27:48.433
Not exactly, but he
had this girlfriend

27:48.435 --> 27:52.203
that started squawking right
before she disappeared.

27:52.205 --> 27:55.440
Millie told me she
ran off with a tourist.

27:55.442 --> 27:56.541
What tourist?

27:59.345 --> 28:02.347
Does she own
this whole property?

28:02.349 --> 28:05.016
I think she owns
the whole damn town.

28:05.018 --> 28:06.551
What's wrong with Billy?

28:06.553 --> 28:08.920
He just seems a little off.

28:10.022 --> 28:13.591
Yeah, she does
treat him like shit.

28:15.728 --> 28:17.362
That looks great.

28:17.364 --> 28:18.363

Yeah.

28:41.187 --> 28:42.187
Okay.

29:01.942 --> 29:03.541
Where are you taking me?

29:03.543 --> 29:05.543
Back in time.

29:05.545 --> 29:07.712
How can we possibly
go further back in time

29:07.714 --> 29:09.547
than we are now?

29:09.549 --> 29:11.349

Dr. Hanson, this is Amanda.

32:33.954 --> 32:35.620
Hi Amanda.

32:35.622 --> 32:38.323
We were making the beds,
and she just passed out.

32:38.325 --> 32:41.259
Would you mind leaving
us alone for a bit?

32:41.261 --> 32:42.660
Why would I do that?

32:42.662 --> 32:45.129
Mildred, please, just
so I can examine her.

32:45.131 --> 32:46.064
All right.

32:46.066 --> 32:48.733
I'll be outside if you need me.

33:10.122 --> 33:11.656
Don't tell me.

33:11.658 --> 33:14.792
It's food poisoning from
that god damn Café, isn't it?

33:14.794 --> 33:15.626
No food poisoning.

33:15.628 --> 33:17.628
She's pregnant.

33:17.630 --> 33:18.696
Pregnant?

33:18.698 --> 33:20.665
She's pretty upset.

33:20.667 --> 33:22.600
I gave her a sedative.

33:22.602 --> 33:25.603
She needs to see her own
doctor for a follow up.

33:25.605 --> 33:27.205
Just keep her resting all night.

33:27.207 --> 33:28.439
Oh sure, okay.

33:28.441 --> 33:30.274
And here's a couple of sedatives

33:30.276 --> 33:32.110
in case she needs them later.

33:32.112 --> 33:34.178
Oh, thank you, doctor.

33:35.214 --> 33:37.782
You don't mind
seeing yourself out?

33:37.784 --> 33:38.883
Sure.

34:07.413 --> 34:08.880
You all right, honey?

34:08.882 --> 34:11.282
No, this isn't happening.

34:13.217 --> 34:16.387
That kind of news
is always shocking.

34:16.389 --> 34:19.690
I haven't slept
with anyone, Millie.

34:19.692 --> 34:21.993
We know that can't
be true, don't we?

34:21.995 --> 34:23.594
But it is true.

34:25.097 --> 34:29.400
Honey, you know, a new life
isn't something to cry about.

34:30.268 --> 34:31.268
What am I supposed to do?

34:31.271 --> 34:33.438
Throw a god damn party?

34:33.440 --> 34:35.039
Calm down.

34:35.041 --> 34:36.706
I'm either giving
birth to the new Messiah

34:36.708 --> 34:39.577
or that doctor is full of shit.

34:39.579 --> 34:41.212
Look, you just get some rest,

34:41.214 --> 34:43.880

of this out tomorrow.

34:43.882 --> 34:45.783

34:45.784 --> 34:46.918
Trust me.

34:49.353 --> 34:50.688
No, it won't.

34:52.891 --> 34:53.891
No, it won't.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.720
What did you do to me?

35:22.722 --> 35:23.988
What the fuck?

35:26.925 --> 35:27.959
Fuck.

35:27.961 --> 35:28.961
No.

35:30.496 --> 35:33.731
That is enough, young lady.

35:33.733 --> 35:35.233
You can't be getting
all worked up like that

35:35.235 --> 35:37.168
when you're pregnant.

35:37.170 --> 35:39.871
It's not healthy for the baby.

35:41.106 --> 35:44.675
Children really are
a blessing, you know.

35:47.246 --> 35:48.579

35:48.581 --> 35:51.649
our little party the
first night, do you?

35:51.651 --> 35:53.017
Of course not.

36:07.966 --> 36:09.667
You drank so much.

36:12.137 --> 36:13.938
Billy, get in here.

36:15.307 --> 36:16.774
Billy, sit down.

36:18.977 --> 36:20.044
This is a good time for you two

36:20.046 --> 36:22.680
to get to know each
other a little better.

36:22.682 --> 36:25.850
You be nice to her, you hear me.

36:25.852 --> 36:27.018
Did you get rid of the car?

36:27.020 --> 36:28.286
Yes, mother.

36:33.125 --> 36:36.060
Now you keep that screaming
mouth of yours shut,

36:36.062 --> 36:37.929
or I'll sew it closed.

36:43.202 --> 36:46.704
What kind of sick and
twisted fucks are you?

36:46.706 --> 36:48.873
I'm sorry, Amanda.

36:48.875 --> 36:51.175
You raped me when I was drunk.

36:51.177 --> 36:52.510
No, I didn't.

36:52.512 --> 36:53.311
I'll kill you!

36:53.313 --> 36:54.579
I didn't rape you.

36:54.581 --> 36:56.180
I would never do
a thing like that.

36:56.182 --> 36:58.049

Sometimes she makes

37:06.392 --> 37:08.826
things that I don't wanna do.

37:08.828 --> 37:10.895
She wanted me to do
bad things to you,

37:10.897 --> 37:12.630
but I wouldn't do it.

37:13.832 --> 37:17.101
Sometimes mother does
very bad things to me.

37:19.338 --> 37:21.405
Please, Billy, just...

37:26.211 --> 37:27.211
Kind of heavy for a

37:34.119 --> 37:36.120

37:37.923 --> 37:39.924
Okay, get her in bed.

Get in the bed.

38:02.382 --> 38:03.948
No, come on,
Billy, you can do it.

38:03.950 --> 38:05.549
No.

38:05.551 --> 38:06.284
Billy, you
can do it, you can do it.

38:06.286 --> 38:07.051

39:16.655 --> 39:18.189
That's good, you're doing it.

39:18.191 --> 39:20.224
Billy, you're doing it.

39:20.226 --> 39:22.960
Come on, give to mama.

39:22.962 --> 39:24.662
Come on, Billy.

39:24.664 --> 39:26.697
Give mama what she wants.

39:26.699 --> 39:28.232
Come on you.

39:28.234 --> 39:29.967
Oh yes.

39:29.969 --> 39:31.302
That's it, Billy.

39:36.975 --> 39:38.075
That's it.

39:39.544 --> 39:40.544
There.

39:42.347 --> 39:43.981
Okay Billy.

39:43.983 --> 39:45.082
That's it.

39:45.084 --> 39:46.183
Oh yeah.

39:46.185 --> 39:47.185
Oh Billy.

39:49.187 --> 39:50.187
That's it, Billy.

39:50.189 --> 39:52.423
Come on, come on, let
me hear it, Billy.

39:52.425 --> 39:53.425
Come on.

39:57.363 --> 39:59.130
Oh yes, Billy, yes.

40:02.334 --> 40:03.768
Oh Billy.

40:03.770 --> 40:05.269
Yes, look Billy.

40:06.104 --> 40:07.671
Look.

40:07.673 --> 40:10.107
You gave mama what she wanted.

40:11.877 --> 40:13.110
Good boy, Billy.

40:17.416 --> 40:18.616
Now cover up.

42:07.659 --> 42:09.627
I'm so sorry.

42:12.163 --> 42:13.163
Can I...

42:14.165 --> 42:16.133
Can I get you anything?

42:16.135 --> 42:19.403
You can get me the
fuck out of here.

42:20.539 --> 42:21.639
I can't.

42:21.641 --> 42:23.641
I can, but mother would...

42:23.643 --> 42:25.209
What?

42:25.211 --> 42:26.744
Billy, what?

42:26.746 --> 42:27.678
Hit you?

42:27.680 --> 42:29.413
Make your life a living hell?

42:29.415 --> 42:32.149
She's already done that.

42:32.151 --> 42:33.484
You're a grown man.

42:33.486 --> 42:35.886
You need to stand up
and do what's right.

42:35.888 --> 42:37.221
I know, I know,

42:38.223 --> 42:39.290
but I can't.

42:41.359 --> 42:42.560
Yes, you can.

42:42.562 --> 42:44.028
Yes, you can, Billy.

42:44.030 --> 42:45.429
You're sweet.

42:45.431 --> 42:47.364
You're caring.

42:47.366 --> 42:49.366
You're not a monster.

42:49.368 --> 42:51.235
I've done bad things.

42:51.237 --> 42:53.404
We've all done bad things.

42:53.406 --> 42:57.374
The police are gonna
come and lock you up.

42:57.376 --> 42:59.109
I don't wanna go
in the closet again.

42:59.111 --> 43:00.544
Not the closet, Billy.

43:00.546 --> 43:02.246
Not the closet, but in a cage,

43:02.248 --> 43:04.114
and for a very long time.

43:04.116 --> 43:05.950
No, no, no.

43:05.952 --> 43:06.750
Please!

43:06.752 --> 43:07.551
No, Billy!

43:07.553 --> 43:08.352
No Billy, wait.

43:08.354 --> 43:09.520
Billy wait.

43:09.522 --> 43:10.522
Billy wait.

43:12.591 --> 43:13.591
Billy, come back!

43:13.593 --> 43:14.593
Help me!

43:40.418 --> 43:42.152
Good morning, sunshine.

43:42.154 --> 43:44.388
Did you sleep well?

43:44.390 --> 43:46.390
Oh, I'm sorry
about the stitches,

43:46.392 --> 43:49.860
but this is a quiet
community, you know.

43:51.062 --> 43:52.062
What's that?

43:52.064 --> 43:53.430
What?

43:53.432 --> 43:55.966
Oh, I would fix
you some breakfast,

43:55.968 --> 43:58.936
but I have a feeling
you wouldn't eat right.

44:01.474 --> 44:03.007
Which reminds me.

44:03.009 --> 44:05.442
When you decide to cooperate,
we'll see what we can do

44:05.444 --> 44:08.012
about taking those out.

44:08.014 --> 44:12.316
Trust me, they come out a
lot easier than going in.

44:13.652 --> 44:16.920
Oh, and look what I
found on the road.

44:19.524 --> 44:20.691
You must have dropped it

44:20.693 --> 44:23.327
after your date with Brad.

44:23.329 --> 44:26.330
Oh, just remembered Billy
has something for you.

44:26.332 --> 44:27.431
Billy!

44:29.801 --> 44:31.769
Come on in, Billy.

44:31.771 --> 44:33.704
You can do it.

44:33.706 --> 44:35.305
We talked about it, god damn it.

44:35.307 --> 44:36.307
Do it.

44:40.478 --> 44:43.681
Get down on your
knees, that's right.

44:44.816 --> 44:48.285
This is such a
special woman, Billy.

44:48.287 --> 44:49.486
Go on, sweetie.

44:49.488 --> 44:50.821
Will you...

44:50.823 --> 44:54.024
Go on, you can do it, sweetie.

44:54.026 --> 44:55.693
Will you marry me?

44:58.897 --> 44:59.830
God damn it!

44:59.832 --> 45:01.899
You answer him, you bitch!

45:03.735 --> 45:06.236
Put it on her finger, Billy.

45:07.372 --> 45:08.472
Hold it.

45:09.474 --> 45:11.375
I forgot the camera.

45:18.550 --> 45:20.150
Okay, hold it now.

45:20.152 --> 45:21.885
The two of you smile.

45:23.321 --> 45:24.688
Ah, wonderful.

45:24.690 --> 45:25.690
One more.

45:26.357 --> 45:27.958
Oh, so beautiful.

45:29.394 --> 45:30.761
That's it, Billy.

45:30.763 --> 45:32.362
Okay, come on, honey.

45:32.364 --> 45:34.498
We've got some wedding
planning to do.

45:34.500 --> 45:35.432
Come on.

45:35.434 --> 45:36.767
Come with mother.

45:36.769 --> 45:37.568
Come on, darling.

45:37.570 --> 45:39.269
Come with me.

46:38.329 --> 46:39.963
What do you want?

46:39.965 --> 46:42.566
I was just wondering when
Amanda was coming back.

46:42.568 --> 46:44.101
She left this book at the Café,

46:44.103 --> 46:46.170
and I was wanting to return it.

46:46.172 --> 46:47.471
Oh really?

46:47.473 --> 46:49.072
Now why would Amanda
want to be reading

46:49.074 --> 46:51.542
a book about god damn trout?

46:52.844 --> 46:53.911
I don't know, ma'am.

46:53.913 --> 46:56.680
I was just returning it.

46:56.682 --> 46:59.550
Well, I'll see that she gets it.

47:00.585 --> 47:03.253
Don't you have a Café to run?

47:03.255 --> 47:05.155
Yes, ma'am, I do.

47:05.157 --> 47:06.157
Thank you.

47:12.497 --> 47:14.431
You keep your eye on him, Billy.

47:14.433 --> 47:15.666
You hear me?

47:15.668 --> 47:17.501
Yes, mother.

47:37.655 --> 47:40.891
Oh my god, what
have they done to you?

47:43.228 --> 47:44.161
It's all right, it's all right.

47:44.163 --> 47:44.895
I'm gonna get you out of here.

47:44.897 --> 47:46.964
It's okay, it's okay.

47:50.835 --> 47:53.904
You god damn
little fucking whore!

48:02.413 --> 48:04.548
Look at that ring.

48:04.550 --> 48:07.317
You don't deserve
that beautiful ring.

48:07.319 --> 48:10.487
I oughta cut your
fucking fingers off.

48:10.489 --> 48:13.056
You're nothing but a
two bit little slut.

48:13.058 --> 48:16.693
Billy, get in here and
clean up this mess.

48:16.695 --> 48:17.828
Well, don't just stand there.

48:17.830 --> 48:19.296
Get some towels.

48:25.536 --> 48:26.637
Oh god.

48:30.008 --> 48:33.644
He never did have much
brains to begin with.

48:34.746 --> 48:36.246
Now look at him.

48:38.082 --> 48:41.652
Billy, you gotta bring
some garbage bags.

48:45.256 --> 48:48.659
Do you know how much
garbage bags cost?

48:49.727 --> 48:51.695
Of course you don't.

48:51.697 --> 48:56.133
Because you're nothing but
a little gold digging whore.

49:15.119 --> 49:16.286
Hey Joe.

49:16.288 --> 49:17.120
Good morning, Julie.

49:17.122 --> 49:18.055
Mornin'.

49:18.057 --> 49:19.556
You know, I had no idea

49:19.558 --> 49:21.291
they made so many
different kind of bagels.

49:21.293 --> 49:23.593
Did you know that they
made Jalapeño bagels?

49:23.595 --> 49:24.861
Damn good too.

49:25.830 --> 49:27.397
Bought a couple extra for ya.

49:27.399 --> 49:29.499
Really, you should try one.

49:29.501 --> 49:30.634
Cream cheese in them too.

49:30.636 --> 49:32.302
Yeah.

49:32.304 --> 49:33.937
How about just rub it on my
ass and skip the middle man.

49:33.939 --> 49:35.405
Hey, watch it.

49:36.774 --> 49:38.141
Anything goin' on?

49:38.143 --> 49:39.910
Had a call from a girl
looking for her friend.

49:39.912 --> 49:40.677
Yeah?

49:40.679 --> 49:42.179
Missing person?

49:42.181 --> 49:44.047
That's a 10-66 right?

49:45.083 --> 49:46.083
10-57.

49:47.318 --> 49:48.652
Yeah.

49:48.654 --> 49:49.820
Not sure if she's
actually missing,

49:49.822 --> 49:51.688
but the girl says that
she took a job out

49:51.690 --> 49:53.690
at that hotel in Mitchell,

49:53.692 --> 49:55.292
and she hasn't heard
from her in weeks.

49:55.294 --> 49:56.526
Says that her cell phone

49:56.528 --> 49:57.928
just goes straight
through to voicemail.

49:57.930 --> 50:00.197
That's Millie Colvin's
place, isn't it?

50:00.199 --> 50:01.498
Yeah.

50:01.500 --> 50:02.933
Yeah, I told her
we'd look into it.

50:02.935 --> 50:04.167
That's funny.

50:04.169 --> 50:05.502
Haven't heard a
peep out in Mitchell

50:05.504 --> 50:07.804
since old man Miller
got he's balls stuck

50:07.806 --> 50:09.639
climbing over his
Barb wire fence.

50:12.711 --> 50:13.810
Yeah.

50:13.812 --> 50:15.312
Her name's Amanda Millard.

50:15.314 --> 50:19.016
She drives a 1997
red Toyota Turcel.

50:19.018 --> 50:20.550
Nice day for a drive.

50:20.552 --> 50:21.785
Suppose it is.

50:23.521 --> 50:25.555
Oh, if you're not gonna...

50:25.557 --> 50:26.656
No, no.

50:26.658 --> 50:27.691
Take 'em.

50:27.693 --> 50:28.693
Please.

50:31.195 --> 50:32.496
Here.

50:32.498 --> 50:34.731
Just in case you get lonely.

51:00.591 --> 51:02.759
Oh, I'm tired of
this god damn mess.

51:02.761 --> 51:04.428
Here, you take this.

51:05.563 --> 51:07.564
As for you, young lady,

51:07.566 --> 51:08.832
I suggest you straighten up

51:08.834 --> 51:12.502
and start being a team
player around here.

51:18.576 --> 51:19.509
Barrel of fucks.

51:19.511 --> 51:21.111
It's that god damn sheriff.

51:25.249 --> 51:26.249
Oh shut up.

51:30.521 --> 51:32.456
Okay, Billy, stop doing that.

51:32.458 --> 51:33.690
Get in bed.

51:33.692 --> 51:34.891
Don't move, and keep her quiet.

51:34.893 --> 51:36.927
Do you understand me?

51:47.138 --> 51:48.805
Well, good morning, Joe.

51:48.807 --> 51:50.440
Oh, hello Millie.

51:50.442 --> 51:52.209
I haven't
seen you in a coon's age.

51:52.211 --> 51:54.711
Well, you know,
that's a good thing.

51:54.713 --> 51:56.947
Well, we try to keep
things quiet around here.

51:56.949 --> 51:58.115
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

51:58.117 --> 51:59.149
Oh, no thanks.

51:59.151 --> 52:00.884
Already had my quota.

52:00.886 --> 52:03.053
Had to stop twice
on the way out.

52:03.055 --> 52:05.722
I know, it's a long drive.

52:05.724 --> 52:07.757
So what can I do for you?

52:07.759 --> 52:11.728
Oh, I got a call from a
concerned party in bend.

52:11.730 --> 52:16.099
Says her friend took a
job out here with ya.

52:16.101 --> 52:17.501
Amanda Millard.

52:18.669 --> 52:20.070
Yes.

52:20.072 --> 52:21.805
Lovely girl.

52:21.807 --> 52:24.007
She was a big help to me.

52:24.909 --> 52:26.843
She not here?

52:26.845 --> 52:29.412
She left a couple days ago.

52:29.414 --> 52:32.115
Had some business at home.

52:32.117 --> 52:33.117
She okay?

52:34.085 --> 52:35.919
I don't know.

52:35.921 --> 52:37.254
Told her friend we'd drop by,

52:37.256 --> 52:38.755
see if we could locate her.

52:38.757 --> 52:41.925
Oh, now you've got
me all concerned.

52:41.927 --> 52:42.993
Have you tried calling her?

52:42.995 --> 52:43.994
Yeah.

52:43.996 --> 52:45.362
Going straight to voicemail.

52:45.364 --> 52:47.797
You mind if I take
a look around?

52:47.799 --> 52:49.866
No, no, look around.

52:49.868 --> 52:52.602
File a report, you know.

52:52.604 --> 52:53.803
Formalities.

52:53.805 --> 52:56.873
Well, leave no stone unturned.

52:56.875 --> 52:59.709
It's just me and Billy here,
I don't have any guests,

52:59.711 --> 53:03.280
and he's upstairs sleeping,
so sssh if you can.

53:03.282 --> 53:05.649
Sure, I'll make
it quick and quiet.

53:05.651 --> 53:06.651
Yeah.

53:07.285 --> 53:08.285
Oh shit.

53:53.931 --> 53:54.831
Well, if she shows up

53:54.833 --> 53:56.199
or you hear from her,

53:56.201 --> 53:57.567
you give me a call?

53:57.569 --> 53:59.903
Yes, I will, Joe,
and you do the same.

53:59.905 --> 54:01.438
I sure hope she's okay.

54:01.440 --> 54:03.873
Oh, young girls can
be flighty sometimes.

54:03.875 --> 54:05.675
I'm sure she'll show up.

54:05.677 --> 54:06.876
Well, it's good to see ya again.

54:06.878 --> 54:08.211
Give my best to Melissa,

54:08.213 --> 54:09.879
and I'm counting on
seeing the two of you

54:09.881 --> 54:11.514
at the fall festival.

54:11.516 --> 54:12.983
Never miss it.

54:15.353 --> 54:16.353
Oh.

54:17.888 --> 54:18.855
One more thing.

54:18.857 --> 54:20.223
Yes?

54:20.225 --> 54:22.459
I noticed the Café is closed.

54:22.461 --> 54:25.262
Oh yeah, I heard something
about them losing their cook.

54:25.264 --> 54:27.964
Up and left them high and dry.

54:29.267 --> 54:30.200
Ah, that's a damn shame.

54:30.202 --> 54:31.534
I was hankered for an order.

54:31.536 --> 54:32.969
Them biscuits and gravy.

54:32.971 --> 54:35.071
Hey, listen, just give me a call

54:35.073 --> 54:36.439
next time you're out this way,

54:36.441 --> 54:39.142
and I'll fix you up a nice
big order to take home.

54:39.144 --> 54:40.644
Deal.

54:40.646 --> 54:41.811
You have a great day, Millie.

54:41.813 --> 54:42.979
You too, Joe.

54:55.126 --> 54:56.059
Sheriff's gone.

54:56.061 --> 54:57.594
Did you hide that car good?

54:57.596 --> 54:58.495
Yes, mother.

54:58.497 --> 55:01.097
You better sure as shit have.

55:01.099 --> 55:02.165
All right, get
yourself cleaned up.

55:02.167 --> 55:04.668
We've gotta pay Ben a visit.

55:13.844 --> 55:16.012
Well, hello Millie Billy.

55:16.014 --> 55:18.014
Is that shower drain
still giving you problems?

55:18.016 --> 55:19.816
Oh no, shower's fine.

55:19.818 --> 55:22.018
We're here for, well, let's say

55:22.020 --> 55:23.787
a little more joyous occasion.

55:23.789 --> 55:25.622
Well, now, what will that be?

55:25.624 --> 55:28.091
Well, you remember Amanda?

55:28.093 --> 55:29.959
Well, of course.

55:29.961 --> 55:32.028
An unforgettable young lady.

55:32.030 --> 55:36.199
Well, it just so
happens that she and Billy

55:36.201 --> 55:38.401
have become quite a pair.

55:39.470 --> 55:41.037
She and Billy?

55:41.039 --> 55:44.007
I know, it's very unexpected.

55:44.009 --> 55:45.041
But Ben, it's all I can do

55:45.043 --> 55:47.310
to keep them from running off.

55:47.312 --> 55:49.145
Well, isn't that a miracle.

55:49.147 --> 55:51.047
Is this true, Billy?

55:53.050 --> 55:54.651
Well, I'll be darned.

55:54.653 --> 55:58.888
So, we've come to make
arrangements for a ceremony.

55:58.890 --> 55:59.823
Well, of course.

55:59.825 --> 56:01.491
When would you like this to be?

56:01.493 --> 56:03.793
Well, we'd like
to do it tonight.

56:03.795 --> 56:04.994
Tonight?

56:04.996 --> 56:07.130
Well, I know...

56:07.132 --> 56:08.398
They're in a hurry.

56:08.400 --> 56:09.966
Like, they two...

56:12.870 --> 56:14.471
Oh, I see.

56:14.473 --> 56:16.139
I see.

56:16.141 --> 56:17.741
Yes, and I have raised him
to be a good Christian boy,

56:17.743 --> 56:21.177
so there will be no
consummation without a wedding.

56:21.179 --> 56:23.213
Walk with god, son.

56:24.582 --> 56:27.083
And I don't want you
telling the locals about this.

56:27.085 --> 56:28.818
I want this to be
a private ceremony.

56:28.820 --> 56:30.186
Do you understand?

56:30.188 --> 56:31.588
Of course, Millie.

56:31.590 --> 56:34.190
I don't want them
and their vile gossip

56:34.192 --> 56:36.359
ruining my son's special day.

56:36.361 --> 56:37.427
Very well.

56:38.596 --> 56:41.431
Well then, I guess that's all.

56:41.433 --> 56:43.166
Do you have a licence?

56:43.168 --> 56:44.434
Excuse me?

56:44.436 --> 56:46.569
Well, I can't marry
them without a licence.

56:46.571 --> 56:48.004
Ben, I thought you did all that.

56:48.006 --> 56:50.907
No, you have to go to city hall.

56:50.909 --> 56:53.076
Oh, there's no problem.

56:53.078 --> 56:54.110
A few forms to fill out.

56:54.112 --> 56:55.845
They give it to you
right on the spot.

56:55.847 --> 56:57.414
Well, you know where
the court house is.

56:57.416 --> 56:58.448
Yes, ma'am.

56:58.450 --> 57:01.084
Oh, well then, that does it.

57:02.620 --> 57:04.220
See you at nine, Ben.

57:04.222 --> 57:05.622
Come on, Billy.

57:10.461 --> 57:12.028
I'll be damned.

57:13.597 --> 57:16.166
In mysterious ways you do work.

57:20.938 --> 57:24.707
Oh, what a lucky
young woman you are.

57:24.709 --> 57:26.376
We can't have you
going to a wedding

57:26.378 --> 57:30.647
with your lips all sown
shut like that now, can we?

57:31.749 --> 57:34.717
Do you think you
can behave yourself?

57:35.586 --> 57:36.586
Okay.

57:37.655 --> 57:41.291
Then let's take those
nasty stitches out.

57:42.726 --> 57:46.162
I'm so glad I held
onto these instruments.

57:49.233 --> 57:51.634
And now just a little snip.

57:52.403 --> 57:53.403
There.

57:54.738 --> 57:56.105
There.

57:56.107 --> 57:57.140
And there.

57:57.142 --> 57:59.342
Okay, now, did you know

58:00.344 --> 58:03.413
I have everything
to deliver a baby?

58:08.619 --> 58:10.086
See?

58:10.088 --> 58:13.556
Yes, I can deliver
your baby right here.

58:17.661 --> 58:18.661
There.

58:19.797 --> 58:23.733
So, you see, I used to
help frank all the time.

58:24.802 --> 58:27.270
There's really nothing to it.

58:34.778 --> 58:35.778
One more.

58:41.952 --> 58:43.219
Let me look there.

58:43.221 --> 58:45.989
Yes, I think I have
a lovely lipstick

58:45.991 --> 58:49.425
that will cover those
little stitch holes.

58:51.495 --> 58:55.164
You're never gonna
get away with this.

58:55.166 --> 58:57.200
Of course I will, honey.

58:59.703 --> 59:01.137
No.

59:01.139 --> 59:02.972
There now.

59:02.974 --> 59:04.807
This won't hurt a bit.

59:06.410 --> 59:10.246
It'll just keep you
from getting cold feet.

59:17.421 --> 59:18.421
There.

59:19.990 --> 59:23.426
Now we can get you
ready for your wedding.

59:44.248 --> 59:46.182
Here's your pen.

59:46.184 --> 59:49.185
You can sign right
there, please.

59:50.554 --> 59:52.422
And right here please.

59:55.259 --> 59:59.195
All right, and
that'll be 35 dollars.

01:00:08.572 --> 01:00:09.839
There you are.

01:00:12.242 --> 01:00:13.276
Ashley.

01:00:13.278 --> 01:00:14.077
Yeah?

01:00:14.079 --> 01:00:15.111
Was that Billy Colvin?

01:00:15.113 --> 01:00:17.313
Yeah, William F. Colvin.

01:00:17.315 --> 01:00:18.381
What did he just do?

01:00:18.383 --> 01:00:20.249
He picked up a marriage licence.

01:00:20.251 --> 01:00:22.418
Can I see this?

01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:23.419
I need a copy of this.

01:00:23.421 --> 01:00:24.421
Okay, sure.

01:00:25.222 --> 01:00:26.322
Thanks.

01:00:27.992 --> 01:00:29.592
Oh.

01:00:29.594 --> 01:00:33.229
Oh, don't you look
just breathtaking.

01:00:33.231 --> 01:00:37.934
Do you think the lipstick
is a little bit much?

01:00:37.936 --> 01:00:38.936
Oh well.

01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:45.341
I can't wait for
Billy to see you.

01:00:45.343 --> 01:00:46.909
You're so pretty.

01:00:58.288 --> 01:00:59.088
Joe.

01:00:59.090 --> 01:01:00.456
Joe, you gotta see this.

01:01:00.458 --> 01:01:01.991
I was at the court house
filing traffic citations,

01:01:01.993 --> 01:01:04.994
and guess who was getting
a marriage licence?

01:01:04.996 --> 01:01:06.295
Billy Colvin's getting married?

01:01:06.297 --> 01:01:08.998
Yes, but look who he's marrying.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.333
Oh shit.

01:01:10.335 --> 01:01:11.701
Shit, shit, shit.

01:01:24.715 --> 01:01:26.015
Okay, you take her for a minute.

01:01:26.017 --> 01:01:27.316
I gotta do something.

01:01:27.318 --> 01:01:29.552
Here, here's the train.

01:01:30.354 --> 01:01:31.721
Here, take the train.

01:01:31.723 --> 01:01:35.324
I got her, I got her, mommy.

01:01:41.398 --> 01:01:44.467
It just takes the
edge off, Billy.

01:01:50.074 --> 01:01:52.241
Oh, gotta take a picture.

01:01:53.143 --> 01:01:54.210
Okay, smile.

01:01:55.913 --> 01:01:57.246
Perfect.

01:01:57.248 --> 01:01:58.614
Okay, here we go.

01:01:59.416 --> 01:02:01.350
Here we go, let me, I got it.

01:02:01.352 --> 01:02:03.019
Here, get some flowers.

01:02:03.021 --> 01:02:04.520
All right, I got her.

01:02:04.522 --> 01:02:05.321
Okay.

01:02:05.323 --> 01:02:06.155
Let's go.

01:02:06.157 --> 01:02:07.223
Come on.

01:02:07.225 --> 01:02:09.525
Come on, come on.

01:02:09.527 --> 01:02:11.461
That a girl, that a girl.

01:02:18.736 --> 01:02:19.736
Easy, easy.

01:02:22.706 --> 01:02:24.307
Get her in there.

01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:28.678
Watch out for, watch
out for her hair!

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:31.748
I worked on that
all god damned day.

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:34.550
Get her dress in there.

01:02:34.552 --> 01:02:35.351
Okay.

01:02:35.353 --> 01:02:37.520
Good boy, good boy.

01:03:03.413 --> 01:03:05.882
Well, don't you look nice.

01:03:07.251 --> 01:03:08.417
Are you nervous, Billy?

01:03:08.419 --> 01:03:09.552
Yes sir.

01:03:09.554 --> 01:03:11.487
Well, don't you worry.

01:03:11.489 --> 01:03:13.156
Just enjoy it.

01:03:13.158 --> 01:03:16.159
It's a man's right of passage
to be married to a woman.

01:03:16.161 --> 01:03:18.494
Put your foot up.

01:03:21.465 --> 01:03:24.133
God embraces matrimony.

01:03:24.135 --> 01:03:28.404
Mother says when the music
starts, she'll bring her in.

01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:40.917
Oh my god, Billy.

01:03:42.519 --> 01:03:44.187
She looks beautiful.

01:03:46.123 --> 01:03:47.523
No, this way.

01:03:57.467 --> 01:03:59.335
Is she okay?

01:03:59.337 --> 01:04:00.636
She's fine.

01:04:00.638 --> 01:04:03.506
She just had a little
too much champagne.

01:04:07.644 --> 01:04:10.112
Dearly beloved, we
are gathered here today

01:04:10.114 --> 01:04:12.448
to welcome Billy and Amanda

01:04:13.951 --> 01:04:16.519
into an agreement
of holy matrimony.

01:04:16.521 --> 01:04:18.154
If there is anyone present

01:04:18.156 --> 01:04:20.523
who objects to the
wedding of these two,

01:04:20.525 --> 01:04:23.526
please speak now or
forever hold your peace.

01:04:23.528 --> 01:04:25.361
For god's sake Ben,
there's nobody here.

01:04:25.363 --> 01:04:26.562
Get on with it.

01:04:26.564 --> 01:04:27.630
I'm sorry, Millie.

01:04:27.632 --> 01:04:28.898
I'm just reading
what's down here.

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:30.299
Well, get on with it.

01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:45.214
Mildred!

01:04:55.525 --> 01:04:56.525
The church.

01:05:06.236 --> 01:05:09.205
Do you, Billy
Colvin, take this woman

01:05:09.207 --> 01:05:11.841
to be your lawfully wedded wife,

01:05:11.843 --> 01:05:15.544
to have and to hold in
sickness and in health,

01:05:15.546 --> 01:05:19.282
for richer or poorer,
'til death do you part?

01:05:20.684 --> 01:05:21.684
Yeah.

01:05:22.286 --> 01:05:23.286
I do.

01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:30.393
Oh god, I wish your dad
were here to see you, Billy.

01:05:30.395 --> 01:05:33.262
And do you, Amanda Millard,

01:05:33.264 --> 01:05:36.432
take this man to be your
lawfully wedded husband,

01:05:36.434 --> 01:05:39.702
in sickness and in health,
for richer or poorer,

01:05:39.704 --> 01:05:41.637
'til death do you part?

01:05:43.907 --> 01:05:44.907
Answer him.

01:05:44.909 --> 01:05:46.075
Now.

01:05:46.077 --> 01:05:46.876
God damn it.

01:05:46.878 --> 01:05:48.544
Answer him.

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:01.090
No!

01:06:03.627 --> 01:06:05.227
You fucking cunt.

01:06:09.066 --> 01:06:09.832
God in heaven.

01:06:09.834 --> 01:06:10.666
What have you done?

01:06:10.668 --> 01:06:11.734
Mother.

01:06:11.736 --> 01:06:12.635
Mother.

01:06:12.637 --> 01:06:14.270
Someone, call the police!

01:06:14.272 --> 01:06:15.938
Billy, get your hands up!

01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:16.739
Put 'em up!

01:06:16.741 --> 01:06:17.573
Drop your weapons!

01:06:17.575 --> 01:06:18.841
Put 'em up!

01:06:18.843 --> 01:06:21.744
I don't wanna go in a cage!

01:06:25.749 --> 01:06:28.584
Dispatch, this is sheriff Palin.

01:06:28.586 --> 01:06:31.153
10-40 is a Mitchell
church of Christ.

01:06:31.155 --> 01:06:32.755
I need an 11-40...

01:06:32.757 --> 01:06:34.623
I need 11-4...

01:06:34.625 --> 01:06:38.527
Just get me an ambulance
and back up, pronto.

01:06:38.529 --> 01:06:39.962
Ben, stick around.

01:06:39.964 --> 01:06:42.932
I'm gonna have some
questions for you later.

01:06:42.934 --> 01:06:44.834
Get her out of here!

01:06:47.671 --> 01:06:51.007
I don't wanna go in a cage!

01:07:19.803 --> 01:07:21.737
Good morning, everyone.

01:07:21.739 --> 01:07:23.873
This is case number dr7413.

01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:28.144
Millard Verus Colvin.

01:07:28.146 --> 01:07:29.745
Counsel, it's my understanding

01:07:29.747 --> 01:07:33.082
that you've been successful
in reaching an agreement today

01:07:33.084 --> 01:07:36.218
to settle this case out
of court, is that correct?

01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:37.153
Yes, your honor.

01:07:37.155 --> 01:07:38.654
That's correct, your honor.

01:07:38.656 --> 01:07:41.057
And Mr. Colvin, I understand
that you are currently

01:07:41.059 --> 01:07:42.658
serving a five-year sentence

01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:45.895
for being an accessory
to kidnapping,

01:07:45.897 --> 01:07:47.830
harassment and assault.

01:07:47.832 --> 01:07:48.831
Is that correct?

01:07:48.833 --> 01:07:50.266
Yes, your honor.

01:07:51.735 --> 01:07:55.104
And it's my understanding
that you are in agreement

01:07:55.106 --> 01:07:58.441
that you are going to transfer
all of the inherited assets

01:07:58.443 --> 01:08:01.444
that you received from
the late Mildred Colvin

01:08:01.446 --> 01:08:02.845
to Ms. Millard.

01:08:03.747 --> 01:08:07.083
Not limited to,
but also including

01:08:07.085 --> 01:08:09.718
the Oregon hotel,
the gas station

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:11.754
and the surrounding property,

01:08:11.756 --> 01:08:13.422
and I need to assure

01:08:13.424 --> 01:08:16.091
that you are entering into
this agreement voluntarily

01:08:16.094 --> 01:08:17.626
of your own free will.

01:08:17.627 --> 01:08:18.861
Is that correct?

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:23.765
Yes, sir, I want her
to have all those things.

01:08:23.768 --> 01:08:26.602
And counsel, it is also
my further understanding

01:08:26.604 --> 01:08:29.071
that your client, Ms. Millard,

01:08:29.073 --> 01:08:31.607
has agreed to
accept these assets

01:08:31.609 --> 01:08:33.876
in full settlement of this suit.

01:08:33.877 --> 01:08:35.211
Yes, your honor.

01:08:35.212 --> 01:08:36.479
Ms. Millard.

01:08:37.948 --> 01:08:40.883
I'm sorry, ma'am, you
have to speak out loud.

01:08:40.885 --> 01:08:41.783
Here you to.

01:08:41.786 --> 01:08:43.586
I'm sorry, yes, your honor.

01:08:43.587 --> 01:08:48.090
All right, I'm gonna go
ahead and sign the agreement.

01:08:48.091 --> 01:08:50.725
Ms. Millard, I'm sorry
for your troubles,

01:08:50.728 --> 01:08:53.895
and I'm certain that nothing
that we can do here today

01:08:53.898 --> 01:08:56.832
is going to impact
that completely,

01:08:56.834 --> 01:08:59.135
but I hope this at
least begins the process

01:08:59.136 --> 01:09:02.404
of taking you to a better place.

01:09:02.406 --> 01:09:03.839
Thank you all very much.

01:09:03.841 --> 01:09:05.374
Court is adjourned.

01:09:08.078 --> 01:09:09.645
You did so good.

01:09:09.647 --> 01:09:10.880
You did so good.

01:09:44.214 --> 01:09:46.048
Adam, how many
times have I told you

01:09:46.050 --> 01:09:47.383
not to run through the sheets?

01:09:47.385 --> 01:09:50.486
You're gonna get 'em all dirty.

01:09:50.488 --> 01:09:51.453
He's so cute.

01:09:51.455 --> 01:09:52.621
Good thing.

01:09:54.858 --> 01:09:57.326
Okay, this is enough,
I can't take anymore.

01:09:57.328 --> 01:09:58.328
Seriously.

01:10:35.098 --> 01:10:36.098
Adam.

01:10:38.902 --> 01:10:41.503
Adam, where are you, darlin'?

01:10:45.376 --> 01:10:46.376
Adam.

01:10:52.048 --> 01:10:53.048
Adam.

01:10:55.018 --> 01:10:56.018
Brittany.

01:10:57.053 --> 01:10:58.053
Adam.

01:11:04.261 --> 01:11:05.261
Adam.

01:11:06.062 --> 01:11:07.529
What did you do?

01:11:09.633 --> 01:11:11.634
What did you do?

01:11:11.636 --> 01:11:12.968
It's okay, mama.

01:11:12.970 --> 01:11:17.006
She was nothing but a
gold digging little whore.

01:11:18.305 --> 01:11:24.753
