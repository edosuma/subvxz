that looks like to us?

10:51.041 --> 10:53.870
- You should go to Med.
- I'm good.

10:57.091 --> 10:59.310
- What'd you do to yourself?
- From when I hit the door.

10:59.354 --> 11:01.748
I'm not going to Med.
I'll be IOD.

11:01.791 --> 11:03.401
Don't bench me, Boss.

11:05.316 --> 11:07.101
- I just wanted to see
Makayla.

11:07.144 --> 11:09.146
I just lost custody of her.

11:09.190 --> 11:11.322
- Or you wanted to see her
leave school so you could

11:11.366 --> 11:13.150
tell the kidnappers that
Makayla was on her way home.

11:13.194 --> 11:15.022
- No, that's not what happened.

11:15.065 --> 11:16.676
- They killed a young woman,

11:16.719 --> 11:18.460
so you're
on the hook for felony murder.

11:18.503 --> 11:19.635
- I didn't do anything.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.071
How dare you drag me
from my home

11:21.115 --> 11:22.725
and accuse me of anything.

11:22.769 --> 11:24.596
I didn't take Makayla,
I love her--

11:24.640 --> 11:25.989
- That's right,
you do love her.

11:26.033 --> 11:27.382
That's why when the court
didn't award you custody,

11:27.425 --> 11:28.949
you took her.
- I didn't take her.

11:28.992 --> 11:30.907
I respect
the court's decision

11:30.951 --> 11:33.214
even though they made
the wrong choice, they made--

11:35.825 --> 11:37.000
Do you see?

11:37.044 --> 11:38.262
Now, huh?
- Hey.

11:38.306 --> 11:39.960
- No, no, do you see?
- Come on.

11:40.003 --> 11:41.439
- You see? Huh?

11:41.483 --> 11:43.572
Drag the Black man
out of his home in cuffs,

11:43.615 --> 11:46.183
and take my brother's child so
you can raise her as your own.

11:46.227 --> 11:47.489
No, no. Don't you
pretend that you can't see

11:47.532 --> 11:49.099
that this was not
the right choice.

11:49.143 --> 11:50.318
- All right, sit down!
- They made the wrong choice

11:50.361 --> 11:51.449
on this--you see this?
- Sit down!

11:51.493 --> 11:52.929
- Adam, Adam!
- This was the wrong

11:52.973 --> 11:54.931
choice for that!
- Adam!

11:54.975 --> 11:56.803
- Sit down--
- No, I swear to God, if you

11:56.846 --> 11:59.196
took her, I'll kill you--
- I didn't take her.

11:59.240 --> 12:01.677
- Just give her back!
Give her back!

12:01.721 --> 12:02.722
- This isn't on me.
- Come on.

12:02.765 --> 12:04.071
- This isn't on me.

12:04.114 --> 12:06.029
- Let's go! Outside.
- C'mon, c'mon.

12:06.073 --> 12:07.596
- Stop!
- All right, I'm fine.

12:07.639 --> 12:08.902
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12:08.945 --> 12:11.469
- Sarge, Theo's phone records
show

12:11.513 --> 12:13.994
that he got a text message
with a video file

12:14.037 --> 12:16.126
from a burner phone
at 5:30 p.m.

12:16.170 --> 12:19.347
Same burner two minutes later
called his phone.

12:19.390 --> 12:21.349
Five minutes after that,
he goes online,

12:21.392 --> 12:23.743
and starts liquidating assets
and selling stocks.

12:24.569 --> 12:26.484
- So he's not the offender.
- Hell, no.

12:26.528 --> 12:27.790
He's the victim.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.270
This man
has been gathering money.

12:29.313 --> 12:31.794
He's getting hit up for ransom.

12:31.838 --> 12:38.279
♪

12:42.457 --> 12:42.718
.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.329
- How much do they want...
and by when?

12:45.373 --> 12:46.896
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

12:46.940 --> 12:47.897
- Theo.

12:49.899 --> 12:52.728
You got a text at 5:30
with a video file attached,

12:52.772 --> 12:55.557
that was a proof-of-life video,
wasn't it?

12:55.600 --> 12:58.516
Then you took
a 47-second phone call.

12:58.560 --> 12:59.822
It was the kidnappers.

12:59.866 --> 13:03.260
They were telling you
how much and by when.

13:04.087 --> 13:06.220
And they told you no cops,
didn't they?

13:06.263 --> 13:07.787
Listen.

13:09.789 --> 13:13.270
We have a warrant
for your phone, okay?

13:13.314 --> 13:15.272
I'm gonna get the video
and the call

13:15.316 --> 13:16.796
in a few hours anyway.

13:18.841 --> 13:20.843
Please...

13:20.887 --> 13:23.237
just save me the time.

13:23.280 --> 13:25.413
For Makayla.

13:25.456 --> 13:27.458
Just tell me now.

13:30.679 --> 13:32.855
Theo,

13:32.899 --> 13:36.511
you gotta forget who won
or lost that court case,

13:36.554 --> 13:38.774
it doesn't matter--
- I know that.

13:41.690 --> 13:43.474
They want a million dollars.

13:43.518 --> 13:45.520
They're gonna contact me
tomorrow around 2:00 p.m.

13:45.563 --> 13:47.391
to tell me when
and where to make the drop.

13:47.435 --> 13:48.915
- Thank you.

13:48.958 --> 13:50.873
All right.

13:50.917 --> 13:53.615
Do you have any idea--
- I have no idea

13:53.658 --> 13:55.138
who would do
something like this.

13:55.182 --> 13:56.836
I don't have people in my life

13:56.879 --> 13:58.620
who would steal a child.
- Okay.

13:58.663 --> 14:01.928
Listen, I need that video now.

14:01.971 --> 14:03.930
- Look, they said
if I even talk to the--

14:03.973 --> 14:07.107
- Theo, I'm gonna get it
either way.

14:07.150 --> 14:08.543
Please.

14:10.675 --> 14:13.287
- Screen lock is 0929.

14:13.330 --> 14:15.550
That's all I'm giving you.

14:15.593 --> 14:17.508
- You gotta understand...

14:19.597 --> 14:21.469
This is my job, kay,
this is what I do,

14:21.512 --> 14:24.124
work cases like this,
believe me.

14:24.167 --> 14:26.082
Believe me.

14:27.475 --> 14:30.347
You need to work with us.

14:30.391 --> 14:32.219
- They said
that they would kill her

14:32.262 --> 14:35.178
if I even talked to you.

14:35.222 --> 14:37.050
Do you understand?

14:39.008 --> 14:40.662
I'm not a lawyer,

14:40.705 --> 14:42.794
but you better believe
that I know my rights,

14:42.838 --> 14:44.927
and you are not
keeping me here.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.668
Now, I am getting
that million dollars

14:46.711 --> 14:48.322
for Makayla,
and I am paying them.

14:48.365 --> 14:49.845
And I am not working with you.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.456
And I am not working
with your...

14:52.500 --> 14:53.936
officers, I am not.

14:58.506 --> 14:59.942
- $1 million.

14:59.986 --> 15:02.553
Call to set the drop
is at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow.

15:02.597 --> 15:04.599
Lock screen, 0929.

15:04.642 --> 15:06.514
- Boss, does Theo
know the men that took her?

15:06.557 --> 15:08.037
We need to wire him up
and press him--

15:08.081 --> 15:09.169
- All right, listen.

15:09.212 --> 15:10.692
I'm only
gonna say this once,

15:10.735 --> 15:12.650
and you have both
got to listen.

15:12.694 --> 15:15.305
I understand
this is your daughter,

15:15.349 --> 15:17.394
but this is my case.

15:17.438 --> 15:19.614
If I think
it's in the best interest

15:19.657 --> 15:21.703
of Makayla,
I will pull you off it.

15:21.746 --> 15:25.837
What happened in that room--
it cannot happen again.

15:25.881 --> 15:28.014
- It won't.

15:30.016 --> 15:33.019
- I've got it.
- Pull it up.

15:45.814 --> 15:48.556
- Run every identifier
you can find in that video,

15:48.599 --> 15:50.514
get it over to CPIC.

15:50.558 --> 15:51.994
I want all
their best techs on it.

15:52.038 --> 15:54.388
I want a full work-up
on that burner,

15:54.431 --> 15:56.781
and the slug on Gabby.

15:56.825 --> 15:59.219
And I want
silent eyes and ears on Theo.

15:59.262 --> 16:02.265
One block geofence
on his phone, then release him.

16:02.309 --> 16:03.919
- Wait, wha--what?

16:03.963 --> 16:06.487
- He's gathering the money.
He's refusing to work with us.

16:06.530 --> 16:08.358
- Boss, then we
make him work with us.

16:08.402 --> 16:10.143
- Adam,
the offenders told him

16:10.186 --> 16:12.754
that if cops are involved,
they're gonna kill Makayla.

16:12.797 --> 16:15.583
Look, now we've
got 14 hours left

16:15.626 --> 16:17.454
before they call
to set this drop.

16:19.456 --> 16:21.676
Let's get movin'.

16:25.941 --> 16:28.552
- Kidnappers always say don't
work with the police. Always.

16:28.596 --> 16:30.641
- They abducted
a Chicago cop's kid.

16:30.685 --> 16:32.774
We can't assume
it's an empty threat.

16:35.298 --> 16:37.953
- We've worked dozens
of kidnapping cases.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.868
Rule number one:
you do not do the drop.

16:39.911 --> 16:42.131
Drop happens, odds go way up
that the kid dies--

16:42.175 --> 16:43.872
Why are we doing this--
- That's why we find

16:43.915 --> 16:46.005
Makayla first, okay?
We let Theo gather the money.

16:46.048 --> 16:47.789
It's a back-up plan
we never use.

16:47.832 --> 16:49.312
We're gonna find our kid, Adam.

16:49.356 --> 16:51.662
You and me.
- Yeah.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.536
- All right, drapes came back.
They're from F&W Drapes.

16:55.579 --> 16:58.147
It's a common style, but we
got work orders coming in now.

16:58.191 --> 17:00.149
- And I'm still
scrubbing everybody

17:00.193 --> 17:01.585
with a sheet that's 6'4".

17:01.629 --> 17:02.891
I got a few hundred
of those names.

17:02.934 --> 17:04.936
- Ballistics back from Gabby?

17:04.980 --> 17:06.634
- No matches on the slug
or the spent brass.

17:06.677 --> 17:08.201
- Burner phone?
- It's off.

17:08.244 --> 17:10.159
Only pinged two locations
today--both are abandoned lots.

17:10.203 --> 17:12.248
One off 50th,
the other off 70th.

17:12.292 --> 17:14.642
Patrol's circling,
but there isn't nobody there.

17:14.685 --> 17:16.252
- All right,
so they're smart.

17:16.296 --> 17:18.211
They're not going back
to the same location twice.

17:18.254 --> 17:19.429
The Chevy?

17:19.473 --> 17:21.127
- We got nothing
on that BOLO yet.

17:21.170 --> 17:22.954
They must've parked it
in a private structure.

17:22.998 --> 17:25.653
- All right, start pulling all
PODs near those abandoned lots,

17:25.696 --> 17:27.133
look for any
vehicle and run it.

17:27.176 --> 17:28.830
- I'm on it.
- Phone company came back

17:28.873 --> 17:30.571
with the location the burner
was purchased.

17:30.614 --> 17:31.659
It's a corner store
on 57th street.

17:31.702 --> 17:33.443
- Good, you and Hailey take it.

17:33.487 --> 17:35.532
- Come on.

17:35.576 --> 17:37.099
- That's the number.
We need the bill of sale

17:37.143 --> 17:39.275
for that phone.
- Naw, you need a warrant.

17:39.319 --> 17:41.669
- No, I don't,
not for you to help me.

17:41.712 --> 17:43.453
But I promise if you
make me go get a warrant,

17:43.497 --> 17:44.715
your life's gonna
get more difficult.

17:44.759 --> 17:45.977
- You need a warrant.

17:46.021 --> 17:47.240
- All right, man,
I'll go get a warrant.

17:47.283 --> 17:48.980
But I'm gonna call
the fire department,

17:49.024 --> 17:50.025
I'm gonna call
the health department,

17:50.069 --> 17:51.635
and my buddy in city licenses,

17:51.679 --> 17:53.202
they're gonna shut you down.

17:53.246 --> 17:54.986
- Who bought the phone?

17:56.510 --> 17:58.077
- All right, we'll come back.

17:59.687 --> 18:01.123
- Reza.

18:01.167 --> 18:04.866
I let him pay in cash.
I don't keep receipts.

18:04.909 --> 18:07.086
- Who's Reza?
Where the hell is he?

18:10.567 --> 18:12.352
- Police!
Let me see your hands!

18:12.395 --> 18:14.615
Get up, walk towards me.

18:14.658 --> 18:16.182
- Where is she?
- Who?

18:16.225 --> 18:17.574
- Makayla, where is she?

18:17.618 --> 18:18.706
- Who?
- Where is she?

18:18.749 --> 18:20.577
- I don't know who she is.

18:20.621 --> 18:22.405
[mutters]

18:22.449 --> 18:24.581
- Keep your hands up.

18:24.625 --> 18:26.409
- Clear.
- Got anybody else

18:26.453 --> 18:28.107
in the apartment with you?
- No, no, I'm alone.

18:28.150 --> 18:30.370
- Guys, get in here,
you wanna check this out.

18:30.413 --> 18:33.155
- What the hell is going on?
I haven't done anything wrong.

18:36.289 --> 18:38.204
- You buy and clone
burners and sell them?

18:38.247 --> 18:39.466
Is that what this is?

18:39.509 --> 18:41.250
- I don't--
- Now is not the time to lie.

18:42.773 --> 18:44.253
- Did you buy a burner
five days ago

18:44.297 --> 18:45.385
from the market on 57th?

18:45.428 --> 18:47.038
Who did you sell it to?

18:47.082 --> 18:48.562
- I would have
to check my computer.

18:48.605 --> 18:50.912
- Here, here's the number.

18:56.265 --> 18:59.225
- Uh, they bought five phones.
- Who's they?

18:59.268 --> 19:01.009
- I don't know.
I don't ask for any info.

19:01.052 --> 19:02.880
- What'd they look like?
- There were two guys.

19:02.924 --> 19:04.578
One was white, real tall,
and the other was a Black guy.

19:04.621 --> 19:06.406
That's all I know.

19:06.449 --> 19:08.582
- Okay, well, we need all those
other numbers right now.

19:08.625 --> 19:10.584
Come on. Hurry up.

19:10.627 --> 19:13.021
- Reza sold them
five burner phones.

19:13.064 --> 19:15.371
Three haven't been turned
on yet, the other two have.

19:15.415 --> 19:16.677
One was used to call Theo.

19:16.720 --> 19:17.808
The other
pinged the same towers.

19:17.852 --> 19:18.679
- These are
definitely our offenders.

19:18.722 --> 19:19.854
They are on the move,

19:19.897 --> 19:20.985
and they're
keeping their phones off.

19:21.029 --> 19:22.857
- Okay so
they're making calls on 'em.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.467
Are they receiving any?
- Yes, sir.

19:24.511 --> 19:27.383
Both of those phones
got calls from a 9429 number

19:27.427 --> 19:28.950
at least three times a day.

19:28.993 --> 19:30.778
- That's a dedicated
state prison landline.

19:30.821 --> 19:32.954
- Tariq. Makayla's father.
- No.

19:32.997 --> 19:36.000
It's Logan Penitentiary.
The women's prison.

19:36.044 --> 19:39.090
- Nia, Tariq's girlfriend?

19:39.134 --> 19:41.484
