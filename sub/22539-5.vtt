<i>Most of their names are
forever lost to us...</i>

02:33.362 --> 02:37.162
<i>...but somewhere, long ago,
someone glanced up...</i>

02:37.324 --> 02:40.954
<i>...to see light perform
one of its magic tricks.</i>

03:02.766 --> 03:03.858
<i>Who knows?</i>

03:04.017 --> 03:09.114
<i>Maybe that quirk of light
inspired the very first artists.</i>

03:20.492 --> 03:22.870
<i>Where did all this come from?</i>

03:23.036 --> 03:26.131
How did we evolve
from small wandering bands...

03:26.289 --> 03:28.963
...of hunters and gatherers
living beneath the stars...

03:29.126 --> 03:32.801

of a global civilization?

03:32.963 --> 03:36.263
How did we get from there to here?

03:57.320 --> 04:01.996
<i>...that light could be made to paint a
picture inside a locked treasure room.</i>

04:03.493 --> 04:07.339
<i>This was the description
of the first camera.</i>

04:07.956 --> 04:09.503

the first movie.</i>

04:23.680 --> 04:28.982
<i>Mo Tze, master of light,
worked against all forms of darkness.</i>

<i>A military genius who only used his talents
to prevent violence...</i>

04:33.899 --> 04:37.529

among the kingdoms of the warring states...</i>

04:39.529 --> 04:42.203

<i>...and to argue against blind obedience
to ritual and authority.</i>

stirrings of the scientific approach.</i>

05:00.884 --> 05:05.230

<i>lbn Alhazen had a passionate desire
to understand nature.</i>

08:33.096 --> 08:34.847
<i>He questioned everything...</i>

<i>...especially those things
that everyone else took for granted.</i>

08:40.895 --> 08:43.774

08:43.940 --> 08:46.318
<i>Some of the great authorities
who came before him...</i>

08:46.484 --> 08:49.237
<i>...had taught that rays
come out of our eyes...</i>

08:49.404 --> 08:54.126
<i>...and travel to the objects we see
before returning to our eyes.</i>

08:54.284 --> 08:55.456
<i>But Alhazen reasoned...</i>

08:55.618 --> 08:59.213
<i>...that the stars were too far distant
for something in our eyes...</i>

08:59.372 --> 09:03.377
<i>...to travel all the way to them
and back in the blink of an eye.</i>

09:03.543 --> 09:06.968
<i>Excellent reasoning,
but Alhazen didn't stop there.</i>

09:07.130 --> 09:11.180
<i>He searched for ways to compel nature
to divulge her secrets.</i>

09:11.342 --> 09:14.812
<i>His culture was open to new ideas
and questioning.</i>

09:14.971 --> 09:19.647
<i>It was the golden age of science
in the Islamic world.</i>

09:19.809 --> 09:22.312
<i>One that stretched from CÃ©rdoba in Spain...</i>

09:22.479 --> 09:26.074
<i>...all the way to Samarqand
in Central Asia.</i>

09:26.649 --> 09:29.448
<i>Christian and Jewish scholars
were honored guests...</i>

09:29.611 --> 09:34.833
<i>...at the research institutes of Baghdad,
Cairo and other Islamic capitals.</i>

09:34.991 --> 09:37.995
<i>Instead of burning books,
the caliphs sent emissaries...</i>

09:38.161 --> 09:41.461
<i>...around the world in search of books.</i>

09:55.970 --> 09:59.520
The caliphs lavishly funded projects
to translate, study...

09:59.682 --> 10:01.776
...and preserve them
for future generations.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.734
Much of the light of ancient Greek science
would have been...

10:04.896 --> 10:07.365
...permanently extinguished
without their efforts.

10:07.524 --> 10:10.198
The reawakening to science
that took place in Europe...

10:10.360 --> 10:13.204
...hundreds of years later
was kindled by a flame...

10:13.363 --> 10:17.209
...that had been long tended
by Islamic scholars and scientists.

10:17.367 --> 10:20.997
The Arabs also imported ideas
from India to the West...

10:21.162 --> 10:25.542
...including the so-called Arabic numerals
that we all use today.

10:25.708 --> 10:28.632
And the concept of zero.

10:31.965 --> 10:36.186
Which comes in handy when you wanna
write "billions and billions."

10:36.886 --> 10:39.309
Arabic astronomy was so influential...

10:39.472 --> 10:43.067
...that we still call most of the
bright stars by their Arabic names.

10:43.226 --> 10:48.232
And the "als" in "algebra," "algorithm,"
"alchemy" and "alcohol"...

10:48.398 --> 10:50.571
...are just some of the traces left...

10:50.733 --> 10:54.408
...from the time when Arabic
was the language of science.

10:56.406 --> 10:59.080
<i>In the 11th century,
lbn Alhazen set about trying...</i>

10:59.242 --> 11:02.917
<i>...to test his ideas about light
and how we see.</i>

11:03.246 --> 11:06.750
So he devised an experiment
to determine how light moves.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.089
He erected a tent in full daylight...

11:09.252 --> 11:12.256
...and sealed it tightly
so that only a single ray of light...

11:12.422 --> 11:14.720
...could pierce its inner darkness.

11:14.883 --> 11:19.013
With little more than his brains
and a straight piece of wood-- A ruler.

11:19.179 --> 11:23.104
--Alhazen had accomplished a great leap
forward in the history of science.

11:23.266 --> 11:27.237
He discovered that light moves
in straight lines.

11:32.108 --> 11:34.281
But he was just getting started.

11:34.444 --> 11:37.323
Alhazen figured out that
the key to forming any image...

11:37.488 --> 11:40.412
...whether you're talking about an eye
or a camera obscura...

11:40.575 --> 11:43.049
...is a small opening
to restrict the light

11:43.061 --> 11:45.547
that can enter an otherwise
darkened chamber.

11:45.705 --> 11:50.962
That aperture excludes the chaos
of extraneous light rays that surround us.

11:51.127 --> 11:55.177
The smaller the aperture, the fewer
directions that light can come from.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.388
And that makes the image sharper.

11:57.550 --> 12:00.144
So instead of being blinded by the light...

12:00.303 --> 12:02.351
...we can see everything it has to show us.

12:03.223 --> 12:08.855
<i>Alhazen made his own camera obscura
and dazzled the caliphs.</i>

12:09.020 --> 12:11.739
<i>A camera obscure works
best in bright light.</i>

12:11.898 --> 12:15.528
<i>The stars of the night sky
are way too dim for this.</i>

12:15.693 --> 12:18.572
<i>We somehow need a bigger
opening to collect light...</i>

12:18.738 --> 12:21.833
<i>...but we also need to maintain focus.</i>

12:22.283 --> 12:26.004
<i>A telescope collects light
from any spot in its field of view...</i>

12:26.162 --> 12:29.086
<i>...across the entire lens or mirror...</i>

12:29.249 --> 12:33.049
<i>...an opening much larger
than the camera obscure hole.</i>

12:33.211 --> 12:36.966
<i>This is one of the first telescopes...</i>

12:37.131 --> 12:40.681
<i>...the one that Galileo
looked through in 1609.</i>

12:41.552 --> 12:45.932
<i>With it, he pulled aside
the heavy curtain of night...</i>

12:46.099 --> 12:49.353
<i>...and began to discover the cosmos.</i>

13:01.114 --> 13:02.741
<i>The lens made it possible...</i>

13:02.907 --> 13:06.161
<i>...for a telescope to have a much
larger light-collecting area...</i>

13:06.327 --> 13:08.000
<i>...than our eyes have.</i>

13:08.162 --> 13:11.712
<i>Big buckets catch more rain
than small ones.</i>

13:11.874 --> 13:14.548
<i>Modern telescopes have larger
collecting areas...</i>

13:14.711 --> 13:16.304
<i>...highly sensitive detectors...</i>

13:16.462 --> 13:19.432
<i>...and they track the same object
for hours at a time...</i>

13:19.590 --> 13:23.140
<i>...to accumulate
as much of its light as possible.</i>

13:23.303 --> 13:25.772
<i>Space-based telescopes
such as the Hubble...</i>

13:25.930 --> 13:29.230
<i>...have captured light from the most
distant and ancient galaxies...</i>

13:29.392 --> 13:33.363
<i>...giving us vastly clearer pictures
of the cosmos.</i>

13:34.480 --> 13:37.484
Alhazen discovered how images
are formed by light.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.073
But that was far from
his greatest achievement.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.659
Ibn Alhazen was the first person ever...

13:42.822 --> 13:45.575
...to set down the rules of science.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.961
He created
an error-correcting mechanism...

13:48.119 --> 13:50.338
...a systematic and relentless way...

13:50.496 --> 13:53.045
...to sift out misconceptions
in our thinking.

13:54.042 --> 13:58.092
Finding truth is difficult...

13:58.254 --> 14:01.098
...and the road to it is rough.

14:01.758 --> 14:06.605
As seekers of the truth, you will be wise
to withhold judgment and not simply put...

14:06.763 --> 14:09.437
...your trust in the
writings of the ancients.

14:10.475 --> 14:15.606
You must question and critically examine
those writings from every side.

14:16.064 --> 14:19.034
You must submit only to argument
and experiment...

14:19.192 --> 14:22.537
...and not to the sayings of any person.

14:22.695 --> 14:27.792
For every human being is vulnerable
to all kinds of imperfection.

14:28.785 --> 14:32.506
As seekers of the truth,
we must also suspect and question...

14:32.663 --> 14:36.463
...our own ideas
as we perform our investigations...

14:36.626 --> 14:41.223
...to avoid falling into prejudice
or careless thinking.

and truth will be revealed to you.

31:36.478 --> 31:39.402
There are many layers
to the fine structure of beauty.

31:39.815 --> 31:42.568
<i>The chemistry of the Earth
and its atmosphere...</i>

31:43.318 --> 31:45.491
<i>...the evolution of life.</i>

31:46.571 --> 31:49.120
<i>Many distinct threads.</i>

31:49.991 --> 31:52.369
Let's just examine one at the surface:

31:52.536 --> 31:54.664
The colors of nature that dazzle us.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.499
<i>What's really happening?</i>

31:58.083 --> 31:59.676
<i>How does the red, the blue...</i>

32:00.627 --> 32:04.177
<i>...the astonishing palette
of nature's colors...</i>

32:06.716 --> 32:08.764
...how do they happen?

32:12.013 --> 32:15.643
Light waves of different lengths
from the sun strike the Earth.

32:17.018 --> 32:19.112
The petals of these particular flowers...

32:19.271 --> 32:23.151
...absorb all the low-energy,
long red wavelengths of light.

32:23.316 --> 32:27.867
But the petals reflect the shorter,
high-energy blue wavelengths.

32:28.238 --> 32:30.582
That interaction
between starlight and petal...

32:30.740 --> 32:32.993
...or water, or van Gogh...

32:33.160 --> 32:34.377
...is what makes blue.

32:35.370 --> 32:36.963
The longest waves...

32:37.122 --> 32:38.715
...the ones we see as red...

32:38.874 --> 32:41.002
...have the lowest energy.

32:43.920 --> 32:48.221
Color is the way our eyes perceive
how energetic light waves are.

32:50.010 --> 32:51.683
<i>A sunset...</i>

32:52.053 --> 32:53.396
...a flag...

32:53.930 --> 32:56.308
<i>...the eyes of your beloved...</i>

32:56.475 --> 32:58.068
<i>...that shiny new car.</i>

32:58.226 --> 32:59.944
The feelings they inspire...

33:00.103 --> 33:01.901
...happen when something inside you...

33:02.063 --> 33:04.441
...is triggered by a
particular variation...

33:04.608 --> 33:07.908
...in the frequency and
energy of light waves.

33:09.696 --> 33:10.913
<i>And the secret message?</i>

33:11.072 --> 33:14.827
<i>Those black vertical lines
in Fraunhofer's spectrum?</i>

33:14.993 --> 33:16.836
<i>What makes them?</i>

33:17.245 --> 33:18.918
<i>They occur when the light waves...</i>

33:19.080 --> 33:22.129
<i>...of those particular colors
are being absorbed.</i>

33:22.292 --> 33:24.590
<i>It happens on another level of reality...</i>

33:24.753 --> 33:28.007
<i>...far smaller than the world
we're used to operating in.</i>

33:28.173 --> 33:33.600
<i>To get there, we'll need to become
10 billion times smaller than we are.</i>

33:35.847 --> 33:38.350
We could pick any one of these atoms.

33:38.517 --> 33:40.940
But let's go for the hydrogen atom.

33:41.937 --> 33:45.783
The hydrogen atom is the most
plentiful kind of atom in the cosmos.

33:45.982 --> 33:47.984
And the simplest.

33:56.117 --> 33:58.370
<i>It has only one electron.</i>

33:59.454 --> 34:01.206
<i>And only one proton.</i>

34:01.373 --> 34:03.250
<i>We've entered the quantum realm.</i>

34:04.042 --> 34:08.172
<i>It doesn't correspond
to ordinary human experience.</i>

34:08.338 --> 34:11.808
<i>Common sense is no help here at all.</i>

34:12.300 --> 34:15.725
<i>Take the hydrogen atom's electron,
for example.</i>

34:17.138 --> 34:20.608
<i>In an atom, an electron doesn't exist
between orbitals.</i>

34:20.766 --> 34:24.567
<i>It disappears from one orbital
and reappears in another.</i>

34:24.728 --> 34:28.233
<i>It's as if you took an elevator
from the second floor to the fourth ï¬‚oor...</i>

34:28.400 --> 34:30.777
<i>...but ceased to exist in between.</i>

34:30.944 --> 34:35.165
<i>And another thing. Quantum elevators
only stop at certain floors.</i>

34:35.322 --> 34:38.418
<i>The sizes of the electron orbits
are strictly limited...</i>

34:38.577 --> 34:41.751
<i>...and different
for the atoms of every element.</i>

34:42.831 --> 34:44.925
<i>That's why the elements are different.</i>

34:45.083 --> 34:48.713
<i>The chemistry of anything
is determined by its electron orbits.</i>

34:48.878 --> 34:52.849
<i>The force that holds an electron in orbit
has nothing to do with gravity.</i>

34:53.007 --> 34:56.181
<i>It's a force of electrical attraction.</i>

34:56.344 --> 34:58.346
<i>The electron dances a wavy ring...</i>

34:58.513 --> 35:01.016
<i>...around the central nucleus
of a hydrogen atom...</i>

35:01.182 --> 35:03.685
<i>...and makes quantum leaps
from orbit to orbit.</i>

35:03.852 --> 35:04.853
<i>Up or down.</i>

35:05.020 --> 35:06.192
<i>The larger the orbit...</i>

35:06.354 --> 35:08.948
<i>...the greater the energy of an electron.</i>

35:09.608 --> 35:12.953
<i>An electron has to get energy
to leap to a larger orbit.</i>

35:13.111 --> 35:15.830
<i>And it has to lose energy
to jump back down.</i>

35:15.989 --> 35:18.868
<i>Every upward leap is caused by...</i>

35:19.743 --> 35:22.371
<i>...an atom absorbing a light wave.</i>

35:22.537 --> 35:26.417
<i>But we have no idea what causes
the downward leaps.</i>

35:26.583 --> 35:30.213
<i>What we do know is that such leaps
always produce a light wave...</i>

35:30.378 --> 35:32.847
<i>...whose color matches
the energy difference...</i>

35:33.006 --> 35:34.929
<i>...between the orbitals.</i>

35:39.471 --> 35:43.396
<i>The sun's surface
radiates light waves of all colors.</i>

35:43.892 --> 35:45.860
<i>If you look at sunlight through a prism...</i>

35:46.019 --> 35:48.192
<i>...you'll see its spectrum.</i>

35:50.398 --> 35:52.901
<i>When you magnify the spectrum
with a telescope...</i>

35:53.068 --> 35:54.945
<i>...as Joseph Fraunhofer did...</i>

35:55.111 --> 35:59.708
<i>...you raise the curtain
on the electron dance within the atom.</i>

35:59.866 --> 36:01.834
<i>When the energy of the electron flags...</i>

36:01.993 --> 36:03.916
<i>...and it drops to a lower orbital...</i>

36:04.079 --> 36:06.673
<i>...the light wave it emits scatters.</i>

36:06.831 --> 36:08.879
<i>Most of it doesn't reach us.</i>

36:09.042 --> 36:10.259
<i>That leaves a dark gap...</i>

36:10.418 --> 36:13.012
<i>...or black vertical line in the spectrum.</i>

36:13.171 --> 36:15.594
<i>These dark lines are the shadows...</i>

36:15.757 --> 36:19.102
<i>...cast by hydrogen atoms
in the atmosphere of the sun.</i>

36:19.260 --> 36:21.934
<i>Sodium atoms cast different shadows.</i>

36:22.097 --> 36:24.976
<i>Their electrons dance to a different tune.</i>

36:25.141 --> 36:29.237
<i>A grain of table salt is composed
of sodium and chlorine atoms.</i>

36:29.396 --> 36:31.740
<i>Ten million billion of them...</i>

36:31.898 --> 36:33.650
<i>...doing their crazy dances...</i>

36:33.817 --> 36:36.195
<i>...in a single grain of salt.</i>

36:36.611 --> 36:39.285
<i>And a single iron atom with 26 electrons...</i>

36:39.447 --> 36:43.623
<i>...is like a great big production number
in a Broadway musical.</i>

36:47.288 --> 36:50.292
<i>When you look at a star
with a spectroscope...</i>

36:51.584 --> 36:55.464
<i>...you see the dark lines
from all the elements in its atmosphere.</i>

36:55.630 --> 36:57.598
<i>Show me the spectrum of anything...</i>

36:57.757 --> 37:00.135
<i>...whether here on Earth
or from a distant star...</i>

37:00.301 --> 37:02.975
<i>...and I'll tell you what it's made of.</i>

37:03.388 --> 37:06.938
Fraunhofer's lines
are the atomic signatures...

37:07.100 --> 37:10.946
...of the elements writ large
across the cosmos.

37:11.104 --> 37:14.199
As with every other major revelation
in the history of science...

37:14.357 --> 37:18.658
...it opened the way
to newer and deeper mysteries.

37:19.612 --> 37:22.707
And to the revelation
that there were many more secrets...

37:22.866 --> 37:24.960
...hiding in the light.

37:40.592 --> 37:43.345
When Joseph Fraunhofer
combined a prism with a telescope...

37:43.511 --> 37:45.513
...and turned it toward the skies...

37:45.680 --> 37:49.025
...he brought the stars much closer to us.

38:00.945 --> 38:04.119
<i>When he was only 39,
he contracted a fatal illness...</i>

38:04.532 --> 38:07.331
<i>...perhaps as a result of his early
and long-term exposure...</i>

38:07.494 --> 38:09.963
<i>...to the toxic chemicals of glassmaking.</i>

38:10.872 --> 38:13.876
<i>You never know where
the next genius will come from.</i>

38:18.797 --> 38:22.552
<i>How many of them do we leave
in the rubble?</i>

38:23.009 --> 38:25.558
<i>The prince and his kingdom
were immeasurably enriched...</i>

38:25.720 --> 38:29.395
<i>...by that act of kindness
to a poor orphan.</i>

38:29.557 --> 38:31.855
<i>Fraunhofer's discoveries
transformed Bavaria...</i>

38:32.018 --> 38:33.986
<i>...from a rural backwater...</i>

38:34.145 --> 38:36.239
<i>...to a technological powerhouse.</i>

38:38.066 --> 38:40.410
<i>As he lay dying,
the government was desperate...</i>

38:40.568 --> 38:43.287
<i>...to preserve every shred
of his precious knowledge...</i>

38:43.446 --> 38:46.746
<i>...about the high technology
of optical glass.</i>

38:48.785 --> 38:50.253
<i>But it could only be divulged...</i>

38:50.411 --> 38:52.755
<i>...to a person with top
security clearance...</i>

38:52.914 --> 38:55.337
<i>...the director of the mint.</i>

<i>...a state secret for

39:19.941 --> 39:21.943
This would prove to be
a major obstacle...

39:22.110 --> 39:24.363
...for someone we'll meet later
in our journey.

39:24.529 --> 39:26.748
But Fraunhofer would allow
no such secrecy...

39:26.906 --> 39:29.580
...where his pure scientific research
was concerned.

39:29.742 --> 39:33.246
He knew that science requires
openness to flourish...

39:33.413 --> 39:36.883
...that our understanding of nature
belongs to the world.

39:37.584 --> 39:40.133
As soon as Fraunhofer discovered
the spectral lines...

39:40.295 --> 39:42.639
...he published everything
he knew about them.

39:42.797 --> 39:45.971
And the reverberations
of his momentous discovery...

39:46.134 --> 39:47.977
...echo still.

39:51.764 --> 39:55.314
<i>His spectral lines revealed
that the visible cosmos...</i>

39:55.476 --> 39:58.480
<i>...is all made of the same elements.</i>

40:02.567 --> 40:03.819

40:43.733 --> 40:44.780
<i>He made it possible...</i>

40:44.943 --> 40:49.244
<i>...for us to know what's in the atmospheres
of other worlds...</i>

40:50.073 --> 40:53.577
<i>...and in galaxies
millions of light-years away.</i>

40:54.035 --> 40:57.835
<i>Spectral lines revealed not only
the composition of far-off objects...</i>

40:57.997 --> 41:00.876
<i>...but also their motion
towards or away from us.</i>

41:01.042 --> 41:04.512
<i>Using them, we discovered
that our universe is expanding.</i>

41:04.671 --> 41:07.220
<i>But perhaps the greatest revelation
of spectroscopy...</i>

41:07.382 --> 41:11.728
<i>...is the discovery of
the thing it cannot see.</i>

41:16.349 --> 41:18.693
<i>A hidden universe of dark matter...</i>

41:18.851 --> 41:22.025
<i>...six times more massive
than the familiar cosmos.</i>

41:22.188 --> 41:24.282
<i>It's made of some mysterious substance...</i>

41:24.440 --> 41:28.741
<i>...that does not emit, reflect
or absorb any kind of light.</i>

41:28.903 --> 41:31.281
<i>We only know it's there
because of its gravity...</i>

41:31.447 --> 41:33.449
<i>...which pulls on all the galaxies...</i>

41:33.616 --> 41:37.166
<i>...and speeds up
the visible stars within them.</i>

41:40.331 --> 41:44.052
There are many more kinds of light
than our eyes can see.

41:44.210 --> 41:47.259
Confining our perception of nature
to visible light...

41:47.422 --> 41:50.767

41:55.722 --> 41:57.565
They differ only in wavelength...

41:57.724 --> 41:59.726
...but over a huge range.

41:59.892 --> 42:02.020
For instance, infrared light.

42:07.859 --> 42:10.612
<i>The kind that William Herschel discovered.</i>

42:11.029 --> 42:12.952
<i>Or x-ray light.</i>

42:18.119 --> 42:19.996
<i>Or radio light.</i>

42:24.250 --> 42:26.628
<i>Or in gamma-ray light.</i>

42:32.425 --> 42:35.929
<i>These are not just different ways

42:36.095 --> 42:38.564
These other kinds of light
reveal different objects...

42:38.723 --> 42:40.771
...and phenomena in the cosmos.

42:40.933 --> 42:44.358
In gamma-ray light, for example,
we can see mysterious explosions...

42:44.520 --> 42:48.400
<i>...in distant galaxies
that we would otherwise miss.</i>

42:50.985 --> 42:54.285
<i>And in microwave light,

<i>...to the birth of our universe.</i>

42:58.785 --> 43:02.790
We have only just opened our eyes.
