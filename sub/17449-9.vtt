WEBVTT

00:01.250 --> 00:03.542
All right, I wrote up
all my patient reports.

00:03.625 --> 00:05.500
And I also rewrote
all your patient reports

00:05.583 --> 00:07.333
and took out all the limericks.

00:07.417 --> 00:09.709
Hey, I worked hard
on those limericks.

00:09.792 --> 00:11.291
Do you know how tough
it is to find a rhyme

00:11.375 --> 00:13.750
for superhero
that's not pooper-zero?

00:17.083 --> 00:20.208
Hey, why is that
exterminator spraying in here?

00:20.291 --> 00:22.458
It turns out
the superhero Disgusto

00:22.542 --> 00:23.917
had some
alien bugs on him.

00:25.875 --> 00:28.625
I know he saves distant
planets from extinction,

00:28.709 --> 00:30.417
but that guy ex-stinks.

00:33.834 --> 00:36.375
Uh, is that spray safe
for humans?

00:36.458 --> 00:38.125
-Oh, yeah,
-I already asked.

00:38.208 --> 00:39.959
The chemicals he's using
aren't dangerous to us.

00:43.250 --> 00:45.000
( sniffs )

00:49.583 --> 00:50.875
Although someone probably

00:50.959 --> 00:52.792
should have warned
Queen Hornet.

Okay, I have to go
meet up with Gus,

01:45.417 --> 01:46.792
Alan and Skylar to work on

01:46.875 --> 01:48.583
our alternative
energy project.

01:48.667 --> 01:50.375
Are you good?

01:50.458 --> 01:53.083
If by good you mean good
at spinning in my chair,

01:53.166 --> 01:54.500
then you tell me.

01:58.458 --> 02:00.417
Huh. You are improving.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.000
Captain Atomic.

02:07.083 --> 02:08.375
Are you okay?

02:08.458 --> 02:10.458
Don't worry, lads, I'm fine.

02:10.542 --> 02:12.166
I don't feel pain.

02:12.250 --> 02:13.667
Physical pain, that is.

02:13.750 --> 02:16.041
Emotionally,
I'm quite sensitive.

02:16.125 --> 02:18.834
So sticks and stones
will not break your bones,

02:18.917 --> 02:21.208
but words will always
hurt you?

02:22.750 --> 02:24.709
Are you making fun of me?

02:24.792 --> 02:26.667
All right, just tell us
what happened.

02:26.750 --> 02:28.792
The president was visiting
the National Baseball Museum,

02:28.875 --> 02:30.959
and the villain, Ballistic,
tried to attack him.

02:31.041 --> 02:35.500
I stepped in to save the day,
but Ballistic went ballistic,

02:35.583 --> 02:38.417
which I should have expected,
because his name is Ballistic.

02:39.875 --> 02:41.458
So I went all atomic on him,

02:41.542 --> 02:42.667
which he should have expected,

02:42.750 --> 02:44.583
because my name is
Captain Atomic.

02:46.583 --> 02:49.375
You are really bad
at telling stories.

02:49.458 --> 02:51.166
Why would you say that?

02:51.250 --> 02:52.750
You hurt my feelings.

02:54.250 --> 02:56.166
Okay, well,
don't worry.

02:56.250 --> 02:58.125
Oliver has to leave,
but I'm going to take

02:58.208 --> 02:59.500
very good care of you.

02:59.583 --> 03:01.792
Uh, you know what?

03:01.875 --> 03:04.125
Since the hospital is
short-staffed,

03:04.208 --> 03:05.792
I'll stay and help
Captain Atomic,

03:05.875 --> 03:08.750
and you can
figure out a limerick

03:08.834 --> 03:11.417
with a rhyme
for Galtraxian heart tremors.

03:11.500 --> 03:12.750
I already got one.

03:12.834 --> 03:14.667
Galtraxian fart tremors.

03:15.959 --> 03:17.583
All right, so you go.
I got this.

03:17.667 --> 03:19.542
I'm just gonna do
a little slice-slice,

03:19.625 --> 03:21.250
chop-chop, vroom-vroom.

03:21.333 --> 03:23.792
Are you going to use
the chainsaw on me?

03:23.875 --> 03:26.750
No, I was just picturing
myself riding a dirt bike.

03:26.834 --> 03:29.083
Vroom-vroom.

03:29.166 --> 03:31.917
Okay, just please be
careful with him,

03:32.000 --> 03:33.333
and the memorabilia.

03:33.375 --> 03:35.083
They're priceless pieces
of baseball history.

03:35.166 --> 03:36.208
All right, I will.

03:36.291 --> 03:39.125
Hey, I like baseball
as much as the next guy,

03:39.208 --> 03:41.500
if the next guy hates baseball.

03:42.625 --> 03:44.875
Look, you go work
on your little project,

03:44.959 --> 03:48.542
and I'll make sure to be extra careful
with the boring baseball stuff.

03:50.792 --> 03:52.208
Fine.

03:52.291 --> 03:53.917
How could you hate baseball?

03:54.000 --> 03:56.166
It's America's pastime.

03:56.250 --> 03:59.875
I remember going
to my first game in 1934.

03:59.959 --> 04:01.375
I had a hot dog.

04:01.458 --> 04:03.834
It burned my mouth,
which I should have expected

04:03.917 --> 04:06.083
because it's called a hot dog.

04:07.583 --> 04:10.583
Wow, I am bad at telling stories.

04:16.625 --> 04:17.750
Hey, guys.

04:17.834 --> 04:18.709
Sorry I'm late.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.333
It's about time.

04:20.417 --> 04:22.041
I was getting so bored,
I was starting to

04:22.125 --> 04:24.834
somewhat pay attention
to what these two were saying.

04:26.291 --> 04:28.000
You're just staring off
into space.

04:28.083 --> 04:30.291
I said
"somewhat pay attention!"

04:32.709 --> 04:34.834
I was just telling them
I have a great idea

04:34.917 --> 04:36.333
for our energy project.

04:36.417 --> 04:38.458
We can power a light bulb
with the wind

04:38.542 --> 04:40.333
that we create
when we move around all day.

04:40.417 --> 04:41.417
Feel the wind.

04:43.583 --> 04:44.583
That is insane...

04:45.875 --> 04:49.709
that no one has
thought of that yet.

04:49.792 --> 04:52.375
I have an even better idea.

04:52.458 --> 04:54.250
We've all heard of
horsepower, right?

04:54.333 --> 04:56.667
Well, why settle
for pretty fast horses

04:56.750 --> 04:59.709
when we can use really
fast cheetahs?

04:59.792 --> 05:01.625
What?

05:02.750 --> 05:04.709
We just need to round up
a dozen cheetahs

05:04.792 --> 05:06.750
and talk them
into running on treadmills.

05:06.834 --> 05:08.792
I have two cheetahs at home.

05:08.875 --> 05:10.917
Oliver, how many
can I mark you down for?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.792
Zero.

05:12.875 --> 05:15.000
Zero cheetahs.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.750
That'll make it tougher.

05:17.834 --> 05:19.625
But I'll call my cheetah guy
and see what he can do.

05:21.208 --> 05:22.667
Oliver, don't listen to them.

05:22.750 --> 05:24.959
They know
nothing about skience.

05:25.041 --> 05:27.792
It's pronounced science.

05:27.875 --> 05:29.750
I don't think so.

05:31.041 --> 05:33.792
Listen, I like
all of your ideas,

05:33.875 --> 05:34.959
but let's put a pin in them.

05:35.041 --> 05:38.166
Or a knife or an axe,
whatever.

05:38.250 --> 05:42.667
Because I've drawn up plans
for the perfect project, and--

05:44.041 --> 05:45.583
Ugh, forgot my backpack.

05:45.667 --> 05:46.959
All right, I'll go get it.

05:47.041 --> 05:49.083
You guys sit tight
and keep thinking.

05:49.166 --> 05:52.208
Not thinking,
also an option.

05:54.166 --> 05:57.166
Just to clarify,
cheetahs or no cheetahs?

05:57.250 --> 06:00.125
Because if I don't cancel
by 5:00, I lose my deposit.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.500
Now stepping up
to the gurney,

06:09.583 --> 06:12.875
number two, Kaz, number two.

06:12.959 --> 06:14.458
( all cheering )

06:17.625 --> 06:19.083
What are you doing?

06:19.166 --> 06:21.291
Well, I figured if people
would cheer for boring

06:21.375 --> 06:22.750
baseball players,

06:22.834 --> 06:24.500
why wouldn't they cheer
for a real hero?

06:24.583 --> 06:26.667
Me.

06:26.750 --> 06:29.166
So I recruited them
to be my fans.

06:29.250 --> 06:31.041
Oh, and check it out,

06:31.125 --> 06:33.458
Robo Cannon is selling peanuts.

06:38.709 --> 06:39.625
Wait.

06:39.709 --> 06:41.667
What are you doing here?

06:41.750 --> 06:43.750
You came back to check up
on me, didn't you?

06:43.834 --> 06:45.041
You are such
a control freak.

06:45.125 --> 06:46.625
I'm not a control freak.

06:46.709 --> 06:48.291
I just forgot my backpack.

06:48.375 --> 06:50.542
Oh, and by the way,
when you called me a control freak,

06:50.625 --> 06:52.625
your inflection went up like
it was a question.

06:52.709 --> 06:54.458
It should have gone down
like it was a statement.

06:55.959 --> 06:56.875
See?

06:56.959 --> 06:58.417
You just proved my point.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.709
Point.

07:00.792 --> 07:03.875
You know, just because
I do things different than you,

07:03.959 --> 07:05.834
doesn't mean that your way
is right and mine is wrong.

07:05.917 --> 07:06.959
I never said that.

07:07.041 --> 07:08.875
You didn't have to.
I could see it in your eyes.

07:08.959 --> 07:09.834
Ugh.

07:09.917 --> 07:11.375
Why did I have to inherit

07:11.458 --> 07:13.917
my mother's expressive
facial features?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.917
Just go back to school
and leave me alone.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.333
Because you're not
just upsetting me,

07:17.417 --> 07:18.792
you're upsetting my fans.

07:18.875 --> 07:20.625
( all booing )

07:21.625 --> 07:23.250
Ah!

07:23.333 --> 07:25.583
Fine, I'll grab
my backpack and go.

07:25.667 --> 07:26.792
( all cheering )

07:47.750 --> 07:49.667
Did you do something?

07:49.750 --> 07:50.834
You look guilty.

07:50.917 --> 07:52.166
I didn't do anything.

07:55.125 --> 07:57.417
Ugh, stupid expressive face.

07:57.500 --> 07:58.709
Thanks a lot, Mom.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.208
All right,
I've got the plans.

08:05.291 --> 08:07.750
I devised a way to use
the tiny solar panels

08:07.834 --> 08:09.667
on calculators
to harness enough energy

08:09.750 --> 08:11.125
to run this car.

08:11.208 --> 08:13.208
Use your head, Oliver.

08:13.291 --> 08:15.917
There's no way all
four of us will fit in there.

08:17.875 --> 08:20.375
Actually, we decided
to go with my idea.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.834
We'll all wear helmets
with propellers on top.

08:22.917 --> 08:24.417
The rush of air from us
moving around

08:24.500 --> 08:25.750
will spin the propellers,

08:25.834 --> 08:28.208
make energy
and light this bulb.

08:28.291 --> 08:31.208
Interesting,
but the one minor hiccup

08:31.291 --> 08:34.125
I can see with your idea
is it's not mine.

08:35.625 --> 08:37.417
Actually,
I like Connie's idea.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.667
Except for the part about me
having to move around.

08:39.750 --> 08:43.750
That is not going
to work for me at all.

08:43.834 --> 08:46.667
Connie, you'll never be able
to generate enough wind.

08:46.750 --> 08:49.166
Besides,
wind is dangerous.

08:49.250 --> 08:50.792
It creates hurricanes,

08:50.875 --> 08:52.458
which can mess up
your hair like this.

08:53.792 --> 08:55.834
And blows trash
in your face like this.

08:57.834 --> 09:00.000
And knocks you
over like this.

09:00.083 --> 09:02.125
Whoa!

09:02.208 --> 09:05.458
Whereas the sun
kisses you with its warmth,

09:05.542 --> 09:07.750
like this.

09:07.834 --> 09:09.834
Yeah, we got it.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.375
Fine, we'll go
with your idea.

09:15.709 --> 09:17.959
If you insist.

09:18.041 --> 09:20.041
I just got to check out
something real fast.

09:21.667 --> 09:23.667
If we're going
with Oliver's idea,

09:23.750 --> 09:25.250
I just have one thing to say.

09:25.333 --> 09:26.333
I call shotgun.

09:33.166 --> 09:35.959
Bottom of the ninth,
three balls...

09:38.875 --> 09:40.083
two cleats...

09:42.083 --> 09:43.834
and Kaz takes a vicious cut.

09:48.417 --> 09:52.917
That bat is
out of there.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.542
( all cheering )

10:08.500 --> 10:10.291
Oliver!

10:10.375 --> 10:12.458
If you're gonna stare
at your phone,

10:12.542 --> 10:14.250
do it at the movies
or a funeral,

10:14.333 --> 10:15.875
like a normal person.

10:15.959 --> 10:19.959
We are all working
really hard on your project.

10:28.750 --> 10:29.834
What are you doing?

10:29.917 --> 10:31.834
Are you spying on Kaz?

10:31.917 --> 10:34.291
No, I was just nervous
about leaving him there

10:34.375 --> 10:36.458
to treat Captain Atomic
without my help.

10:36.542 --> 10:37.834
But you know what?

10:37.917 --> 10:39.208
He's actually
doing pretty well.

10:40.333 --> 10:41.750
Wait. This is terrible.

10:41.834 --> 10:43.041
I know.

10:43.125 --> 10:45.333
That nurse is
wearing my uniform.

10:47.250 --> 10:49.625
I'm locking
my room from now on.

10:49.709 --> 10:51.834
I'm talking about this.

10:56.917 --> 10:59.291
That's a Venutian beetle.

10:59.375 --> 11:01.000
Those must have been
the bugs the exterminator

11:01.083 --> 11:02.208
was trying to get rid of.

11:02.291 --> 11:03.834
Wait.

11:03.917 --> 11:06.166
That other nurse has my pink
streak in his hair.

11:08.125 --> 11:10.041
Does this always happen
when I'm gone?

11:11.834 --> 11:13.375
You're missing
the point, okay.

11:13.458 --> 11:15.834
I know from the comic books
that these beetles

11:15.917 --> 11:18.083
feed on the electricity
in your nervous system.

11:18.166 --> 11:20.625
And if it bites Kaz,
its toxins will make him

11:20.709 --> 11:23.875
lose control of his emotions,
and within 2 minutes, he'll die.

11:23.959 --> 11:26.291
Do you know who else will die?

11:26.375 --> 11:29.417
That nurse, if he stretches out
my uniform.

11:36.458 --> 11:37.917
This is bad.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.750
You have to call Kaz and warn him
about the Venutian beetle.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.083
I want to, but then he'll know
I was spying on him,

11:43.166 --> 11:45.542
and he'll tease me
about being a control freak.

11:45.625 --> 11:46.709
And not the fun
kind of teasing,

11:46.792 --> 11:48.583
like when he calls me Oli-Pop.

11:48.667 --> 11:51.834
Mean teasing, like
when he calls me Oli-Pop.

11:54.291 --> 11:55.625
What do I do?

11:55.709 --> 11:58.542
I have the answer.
All you have to--

11:58.625 --> 12:01.834
Is that nurse doing
an imitation of me?

12:01.917 --> 12:04.542
Would you focus?
Sorry.

12:04.625 --> 12:06.750
You just have
to go back to Mighty Med

12:06.834 --> 12:08.667
and say we finished
our project early.

12:08.750 --> 12:10.750
Then pretend to see
the beetle for the first time.

12:10.834 --> 12:13.250
That way he'll never know
you spied on him.

12:13.333 --> 12:16.458
Well, I don't like to lie...

12:16.542 --> 12:18.875
unless it's convenient
and I won't get caught.

12:20.166 --> 12:23.250
So good plan.
Okay, I have to hurry.

12:23.333 --> 12:24.875
Kaz is in terrible danger.

12:24.959 --> 12:26.208
Good, you go.

12:26.291 --> 12:29.166
And don't worry, we'll manage
the project without you.

12:29.250 --> 12:32.792
You know what? I'll just write up
a few basic instructions, just to be safe.

12:32.875 --> 12:35.500
Oh, my gosh,
you have an emergency.

12:35.583 --> 12:36.667
-Go!
-Wait...

12:37.959 --> 12:39.166
Jeez!

12:39.250 --> 12:42.000
Kaz is right.
Oliver is a control freak.

12:42.083 --> 12:44.625
And now that he's gone,
we are going to build

12:44.709 --> 12:46.667
the energy project
that we wanted

12:46.750 --> 12:47.834
to do in the first place.

12:47.917 --> 12:49.333
( snores )

12:53.750 --> 12:56.208
It's too bad we're not doing
a lack of energy project.

13:13.667 --> 13:14.834
( clearing throat )

13:14.917 --> 13:17.000
Oh, Kaz!
You're okay!

13:17.083 --> 13:20.250
I mean, you're okay.

13:22.834 --> 13:23.875
Why aren't you at school?

13:23.959 --> 13:26.458
We finished our project early.

13:31.083 --> 13:33.458
And I wanted to do something
we never do,

13:33.542 --> 13:36.417
which is, hang out together.

13:36.500 --> 13:37.959
Away from the nurses' station.

13:39.625 --> 13:42.166
Oh no.
Did you see that?

13:42.250 --> 13:46.333
I think a Venutian beetle
just ran across the floor.

13:46.417 --> 13:48.500
We better find it.

13:48.583 --> 13:50.917
Uh, yeah,
I didn't see anything.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.750
Are you okay, because
this eye says

13:53.834 --> 13:56.542
you're worried about
something, and this eye says

13:56.625 --> 13:58.125
you're lying about something.

13:58.208 --> 14:02.083
No, I'm just worried.
See?

14:05.250 --> 14:08.083
And I'm telling you,
I saw a Venutian beetle.

14:08.166 --> 14:11.041
It was creepy
and metallic and looked...

14:13.625 --> 14:14.542
like that.

14:14.625 --> 14:16.125
It's on your shoulder!

14:16.208 --> 14:17.750
I don't see it.
The other shoulder.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Other other shoulder.

14:21.083 --> 14:22.542
( screams )

14:24.792 --> 14:26.667
I can't get it off!
I can't! Oh!

14:27.709 --> 14:29.125
It bit me.

14:29.208 --> 14:31.750
Oliver, it's about
to take control of my brain.

14:31.834 --> 14:34.000
Please, before it drains
all my energy,

14:34.083 --> 14:35.000
you have to do something.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.041
What?

14:36.125 --> 14:37.250
You have to...

14:39.125 --> 14:41.667
look into this webcam and say
"I just got pawned!"

14:42.917 --> 14:44.583
I knew you were
spying on me with this.

14:44.667 --> 14:47.041
So I set the whole thing up
to get back at you.

14:47.125 --> 14:48.125
What?

14:48.208 --> 14:49.875
When I signed
the exterminator's work order,

14:49.959 --> 14:52.083
I saw that he was
spraying for Venutian beetles.

14:52.166 --> 14:55.500
So I asked the superhero
Replikate to morph into one.

15:02.875 --> 15:04.500
Replikate,
you've got a little...

15:11.000 --> 15:13.875
So care to apologize?

15:13.959 --> 15:16.917
Actually, I don't think
I did anything that wrong.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.583
I was just being careful.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.125
If anyone
should apologize, it's you.

15:20.208 --> 15:21.875
What? Why?

15:21.959 --> 15:23.041
You let me think
you were dying.

15:23.125 --> 15:24.709
I mean, what kind of person

15:24.792 --> 15:26.417
lets their best friend
think that he's--

15:26.500 --> 15:28.000
I can see you, Replikate.

15:36.750 --> 15:38.166
See?

15:38.250 --> 15:40.375
I told you
we didn't need Oliver.

15:40.458 --> 15:43.959
No, but you might need a mirror.
You look ridiculous.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.083
You're wearing
the exact same helmet.

15:47.166 --> 15:48.667
Oh, the helmet
looks great.

15:48.750 --> 15:52.834
I meant your outfit.
Honestly, who dresses you?

15:52.917 --> 15:55.834
Listen, we need
to test the helmets

15:55.917 --> 15:57.208
to make sure they work.

15:57.291 --> 15:59.333
Start moving around
to create wind.

16:02.834 --> 16:04.583
This is stupid.

16:04.667 --> 16:08.500
Why can't we just use
a leaf blower? Or a keiling fan?

16:10.208 --> 16:15.542
We don't need a ceiling fan,
or a leaf blower.

16:15.625 --> 16:17.375
Or a cheetah.

16:18.834 --> 16:20.208
Dang it!

16:21.542 --> 16:23.917
We just need
to move faster.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.500
And I know exactly
how we can do that.

16:30.959 --> 16:33.792
Why do I have to be
the one to do this?

16:33.875 --> 16:36.041
Because you were asleep
when we voted.

16:45.667 --> 16:46.959
Oh, my gosh!

16:47.041 --> 16:48.667
This is awful!

16:50.417 --> 16:52.041
The bulb didn't light up at all!

16:53.458 --> 16:56.041
Oh, I think
I'm gonna pass out.

16:56.125 --> 16:58.291
Great, because
we're about to vote on

16:58.375 --> 16:59.834
who goes down the ramp next.

17:07.959 --> 17:10.583
Kaz, how can you be
mad at me?

17:10.667 --> 17:12.875
I was just trying
to save you from yourself.

17:12.959 --> 17:13.834
I'm over here.

17:19.083 --> 17:21.041
You're a superhero
who fooled a 15-year-old.

17:21.125 --> 17:22.500
Good for you.

17:25.917 --> 17:27.667
Stop messing with me.
It's not funny.

17:27.750 --> 17:29.083
I'm not going to stop
messing with you

17:29.166 --> 17:32.458
until you admit
that you're wrong, Oli-Pop.

17:32.542 --> 17:35.458
That's the meanest thing
you've ever said to me.

17:35.542 --> 17:37.250
I'm out of here.

17:37.333 --> 17:39.917
Before you go, there's
one more thing I have to say.

17:41.834 --> 17:43.458
On your shoulder
a Venutian beetle.

17:43.542 --> 17:48.166
Oh, no.
A real Venutian beetle.

17:48.250 --> 17:50.959
Not a fake one like the
one Replikate morphed

17:51.041 --> 17:53.291
into a few minutes ago.
Uh...

17:53.375 --> 17:55.875
And since it's real,
I better not flick it

17:55.959 --> 17:57.667
between the
eyes like this.

17:58.834 --> 18:00.709
Ow!
Oh, no.

18:00.792 --> 18:03.583
The totally
real Venutian beetle bit me.

18:05.625 --> 18:06.917
Oh, hey, Replikate.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.542
Very realistic Venutian beetle,
by the way.

18:12.959 --> 18:14.750
Oh, no.

18:14.834 --> 18:17.583
It bit me.
Get Horace or Dr. Brainhead.

18:17.667 --> 18:20.083
I'm the only one here. And if you don't
let me treat you right now,

18:20.166 --> 18:21.917
the toxins will kick in.
I have to do this.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.542
That's okay, we have plenty of time
to wait for someone else.

18:24.625 --> 18:26.917
Plus, I haven't even lost control
of my emotions yet.

18:30.417 --> 18:31.792
Okay, okay.

18:31.875 --> 18:33.709
We have 2 minutes
before it kills you.

18:33.792 --> 18:35.667
I know you don't trust me,
but you're going to have to.

18:35.750 --> 18:39.875
Nurse, electrostatic syringe.
Galactic forceps.

18:39.959 --> 18:41.208
Kiss for good luck.

18:44.417 --> 18:45.750
I was talking about me.

18:47.834 --> 18:49.834
Okay, the bug's
clamping down harder.

18:49.917 --> 18:51.709
If I can increase the energy
in your body,

18:51.792 --> 18:53.125
it might release
its hold on you.

18:53.208 --> 18:54.750
Captain Atomic,

18:54.834 --> 18:57.458
can you blast Oliver
with your atomic yo-yo?

18:57.542 --> 19:00.166
You're going to zap me
with a nuclear powered yo-yo?

19:00.250 --> 19:03.375
That seems
extremely dangerous.

19:03.458 --> 19:04.500
( screams )

19:05.917 --> 19:07.333
Well, it's the only chance
we have.

19:07.417 --> 19:08.792
We're out of time.

19:08.875 --> 19:10.125
Captain Atomic,
are you ready?

19:10.208 --> 19:12.208
Well, I'm still highly sedated,
but sure.

19:30.834 --> 19:32.917
Okay, I need suction.

19:39.458 --> 19:42.709
I extracted the toxin.
You'll be fine.

19:42.792 --> 19:46.250
Kaz, thank you.
You saved my life.

19:47.917 --> 19:49.500
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

19:49.583 --> 19:51.667
You know exactly
what you're doing.

19:51.750 --> 19:53.875
Actually, wouldn't it have been
safer for me

19:53.959 --> 19:55.041
to just zap the bug?

19:55.125 --> 19:57.000
No one's talking to you.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.000
What are you guys doing?

20:11.083 --> 20:12.917
Oliver was right.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.083
My idea didn't work,

20:14.166 --> 20:16.458
so we decided
to go with his design.

20:16.542 --> 20:18.834
Oh, and when you were
unconscious,

20:18.917 --> 20:21.709
we voted that you'd buy us
frozen yogurt.

20:21.792 --> 20:23.166
You ate yours while
you were sleeping.

20:24.750 --> 20:26.959
Phew!
I hope this works.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.875
It doesn't work.

20:35.959 --> 20:38.041
What do you mean?
It just moved.

20:38.125 --> 20:41.000
Oh, yeah, the car works.
I meant your outfit.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.208
Seriously,
don't you own a mirror?

20:46.792 --> 20:49.208
Oliver, we just
finished building

20:49.291 --> 20:50.834
your solar-powered car.

20:50.917 --> 20:54.834
I know what you're going to say,
and you're right.

20:54.917 --> 20:57.250
I was being a control freak
and I realize now

20:57.333 --> 20:59.333
that I should have trusted
all of your instincts.

20:59.417 --> 21:02.083
No, you really
shouldn't have.

21:03.333 --> 21:05.166
No, I mean it.

21:05.250 --> 21:06.834
And this project symbolizes

21:06.917 --> 21:08.667
what a controlling tyrant
I was being.

21:08.750 --> 21:10.083
So you know what?

21:13.709 --> 21:15.625
The tyranny is over.

21:15.709 --> 21:18.625
My stupid design probably never
would've worked anyway.

21:18.709 --> 21:22.291
Now let's get started on
Connie's brilliant wind machine.

21:22.375 --> 21:24.583
(All) Yay.

21:25.792 --> 21:28.542
I'll go get the skateboard.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.583
(theme music playing)
