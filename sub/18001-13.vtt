WEBVTT

00:08.080 --> 00:09.713
If you became a superhero,

00:09.748 --> 00:11.248
you had to design your own costume,

00:11.300 --> 00:12.499
would you go full mask,

00:12.551 --> 00:13.500
or would you just wear the thing

00:13.552 --> 00:15.052
that just covers your eyes?

00:15.087 --> 00:16.386
Oof.

00:16.422 --> 00:17.838
I mean, I feel like in real life,

00:17.890 --> 00:19.473
I'd want to go full mask most of the time.

00:19.508 --> 00:21.391
[Laughter]

00:21.427 --> 00:22.593
What about you?

00:22.645 --> 00:23.644
For cool factor,

00:23.679 --> 00:25.095
I would want to go full mask.

00:25.147 --> 00:27.014
See, I don't buy it out of you.

00:27.066 --> 00:28.982
You're such a fame whore.

00:29.018 --> 00:31.068
He'd wear no mask at all. Yeah.

00:31.103 --> 00:32.686
[Laughing] Yeah, right?

00:32.738 --> 00:34.488
There's no way you'd wear any sort of mask.

00:34.523 --> 00:37.441
You'd want the grandeur and the applause

00:37.493 --> 00:38.909
and everything that goes with it.

00:38.944 --> 00:40.494
On my costume, like, my full name

00:40.529 --> 00:41.745
would be emblazoned on there,

00:41.780 --> 00:43.413
yeah, so everybody knew that it was me.

00:43.449 --> 00:45.833
My archenemy will
never find my loved ones.

00:45.868 --> 00:47.668
Kids, daddy wants a modicum of fame.

00:47.703 --> 00:50.254
Don't you understand that
your lives are worth that?

00:50.289 --> 00:51.588
They just got to be a little more careful.

00:51.624 --> 00:52.623
Yeah.

00:52.675 --> 00:53.624
Yeah?

00:53.676 --> 00:54.842
[Laughter]

<i>Hello and welcome to another
episode of Comic Book Men,</i>

01:31.046 --> 01:34.882
the only show that's faster
than Barry Allen. In bed.

01:34.917 --> 01:35.966
I'm your host Kevin Smith.

01:36.001 --> 01:37.301
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

01:37.336 --> 01:39.136
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

01:39.171 --> 01:41.638
Okay, any new product come
through the doors this week?

01:41.674 --> 01:44.224
Last week, the stash cast its net

01:44.260 --> 01:47.811
in hopes of acquiring
one of the last affordable

01:47.846 --> 01:50.597
Marvel silver age number ones ever.

01:55.938 --> 01:57.437
All right, have a wonderful day.

01:57.489 --> 01:59.690
- You too.
- Thanks.

01:59.742 --> 02:00.741
- Hey, guys, how you doing?
- How are you?

02:00.776 --> 02:02.359
I got something real cool

02:02.411 --> 02:03.860
that I was curious if
you'd be interested in.

02:03.913 --> 02:07.164
I have a samaritan number 1 from 1967.

02:07.199 --> 02:10.366
Ooh, Namor, the prince
of the Marvel universe.

02:19.011 --> 02:20.427
<i>Prince Namor, the Submariner.</i>

02:20.462 --> 02:22.296
I mean, created in the '40s.

02:22.348 --> 02:24.359
Fought against the Nazis.

02:24.359 --> 02:26.466
Was he taking down u-boats and stuff?

02:26.518 --> 02:27.851
- Yeah, he's picking them up...
- Oh, yeah.

02:27.886 --> 02:29.469
Crushing them under his armpit, yeah.

02:29.521 --> 02:30.721
Then when they reintroduced him,

02:30.773 --> 02:32.356
he was almost a villain,

02:32.391 --> 02:34.691
I guess 'cause he's
actually more interested

02:34.727 --> 02:37.811
in his own kingdom than surface dwellers.

02:37.863 --> 02:39.479
You know, he has walked that tightrope

02:39.531 --> 02:41.148
between good guy and villain

02:41.200 --> 02:43.317
in the Marvel universe
like no other character.

02:43.369 --> 02:45.535
They never knew what
to do with Prince Namor

02:45.571 --> 02:47.537
and still don't to this day.

02:47.573 --> 02:48.989
Yeah, he started with the Fantastic Four

02:49.041 --> 02:50.407
as the bad guy, then had his...

02:50.459 --> 02:52.159
you know, got his own series,

02:52.211 --> 02:54.494
turned into the good guy,
14 different costume changes.

02:54.546 --> 02:55.996
He looks like a Spock in Speedos.

02:56.048 --> 02:58.248
[Laughter]

02:58.300 --> 03:00.217
But why do you think

03:00.252 --> 03:03.754
the Submariner lags far, far behind

03:03.806 --> 03:05.722
in the rest of the Marvel pantheon?

03:05.758 --> 03:07.474
I mean, that's an age-old question

03:07.509 --> 03:09.309
that I think befuddles Marvel.

03:09.345 --> 03:11.928
Like, they've done at least 15

03:11.981 --> 03:15.098
to 20 different costumes changing on Namor.

03:15.150 --> 03:19.903
Even at the height of Marvel's
mutant mania of the '90s,

03:19.938 --> 03:21.822
they even went on to, like, emblazon

03:21.857 --> 03:23.657
his then current series

03:23.692 --> 03:25.492
as "Marvel's first mutant."

03:25.527 --> 03:26.910
- Mm-hmm.
- Like, that...

03:26.945 --> 03:28.278
they were trying anything to sell...

03:28.330 --> 03:29.279
really, they were trying to be like,

03:29.331 --> 03:31.114
"he could be an X-Men, kids.

03:31.166 --> 03:32.666
"You want to try this out,

03:32.701 --> 03:34.501
"'cause the man lives in the ocean?

03:34.536 --> 03:36.420
Nah? We understand."

03:36.455 --> 03:38.005
I actually got this in 1975

03:38.040 --> 03:39.373
at my first comic convention

03:39.425 --> 03:40.757
at the commodore hotel in New York.

03:40.793 --> 03:42.376
Oh, yeah?

03:42.428 --> 03:44.294
And it's got a little
fun surprise inside.

03:44.346 --> 03:46.096
- Oh, can we open it up?
- Yes, please, please.

03:46.131 --> 03:48.265
It's Anthrax. [Laughter]

03:48.300 --> 03:50.767
No, not with me in the room, please.

03:50.803 --> 03:52.269
Oh, wow.

03:52.304 --> 03:53.970
Is that John Romita?

03:54.023 --> 03:55.138
John Romita, yeah.

03:55.190 --> 03:56.473
- Roy Thomas.
- Roy Thomas.

03:56.525 --> 03:58.141
- I'm a big Don Perlin fan.
- Yeah.

03:58.193 --> 03:59.943
<i>I'm a big fan of his
Werewolf by Night run.</i>

03:59.978 --> 04:01.445
Some of the names,
I'll be honest...

04:01.480 --> 04:02.636
like, I think that's Stan Goldman.

04:02.636 --> 04:03.813
I thought it was Stan Lee at first,

04:03.813 --> 04:05.513
but then I realized
that's not the way he...

04:05.742 --> 04:06.817
- Big difference.
- Big diff...

04:06.869 --> 04:08.618
[laughter]

04:08.654 --> 04:09.820
So you actually went up

04:09.872 --> 04:10.871
and got these signatures yourself,

04:10.906 --> 04:12.372
or you bought them like this?

04:12.408 --> 04:13.373
I bought the book
like this, so I did not...

04:13.409 --> 04:15.042
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

04:15.077 --> 04:16.125
It's one of those
books, though, that, like,

04:16.161 --> 04:17.827
- is still affordable.
- Yeah.

04:17.880 --> 04:19.546
You know, a number 1 Marvel comic

04:19.581 --> 04:20.872
in the Silver Age, I mean,

04:20.872 --> 04:22.048
you can't touch them nowadays,

04:22.084 --> 04:24.501
you know, under a G.

04:24.553 --> 04:26.086
So why are you looking to sell it?

04:26.138 --> 04:27.587
Well, it's the first
comic that I bought,

04:27.639 --> 04:28.805
and I've got a large collection

04:28.841 --> 04:30.841
that I need to start to let go,

04:30.893 --> 04:33.093
so I figured, what if I
could get rid of this one?

04:33.145 --> 04:35.512
Then I could start moving
the 25 long boxes and 25...

04:35.564 --> 04:36.680
of him bothering you more.

04:36.732 --> 04:38.098
[Laughing] 25 short boxes

04:38.150 --> 04:39.483
that I have in my house

04:39.518 --> 04:40.934
that my wife's ready to kill me with.

04:40.986 --> 04:42.602
May be worth taking a risk on

04:42.654 --> 04:44.771
that they're authentic signatures

04:44.823 --> 04:46.273
if the price is right.

04:46.325 --> 04:47.908
I mean, what are you looking to get for it?

04:47.943 --> 04:49.192
I was thinking about 100 bucks.

04:49.244 --> 04:51.111
100 bucks.

04:51.163 --> 04:54.448
I mean, it's not out... it's
not out of the ballpark.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.366
Would you take 60 for it?

04:56.418 --> 04:58.452
Mm. That's a little too low.

04:58.504 --> 05:00.170
What about 85?

05:00.205 --> 05:02.289
How about 75?

05:02.341 --> 05:04.257
You've got my wife on your side.

05:04.293 --> 05:06.426
I think she'll be happy if I
don't come home with it, so...

05:06.462 --> 05:07.427
oh, she got a little
sue storm in her, huh?

05:07.463 --> 05:09.212
Oh, a lot more than that.

05:09.264 --> 05:11.848
I'd go more with Ben grimm
the way she punches, but...

05:11.884 --> 05:15.218
- [Laughter]
- It's clobbering time?

05:15.270 --> 05:16.686
But I'll take it.

05:16.722 --> 05:17.938
So 75 it is?

05:17.973 --> 05:19.222
- That works.
- All right, man.

05:19.274 --> 05:20.807
Awesome. Thank you very much.

05:20.859 --> 05:23.560
20, 40, 60, 75. Thank you.

05:23.612 --> 05:24.644
Awesome, guys. Thank you very much.

05:24.696 --> 05:26.446
- Have a good one.
- Take care.

05:26.482 --> 05:28.698
- What's happening?
- Are you Darryl Mcdaniels?

05:28.734 --> 05:30.283
Yeah, yeah, DMC in the place to be.

05:30.319 --> 05:32.068
I heard this is the place to be, man.

05:32.121 --> 05:34.871
- Yo, this DMC of run-DMC.
- I've arrived.

05:38.390 --> 05:39.639
Hey, man, how you doing?

05:39.675 --> 05:41.308
How you doing? What's happening?

05:41.343 --> 05:42.392
- What can we do for you today?
- What's going on?

05:42.427 --> 05:43.760
Nothing, man.

05:43.812 --> 05:45.095
I've come to check out the mecca, man.

05:45.147 --> 05:46.346
This is the place to be.

05:46.398 --> 05:47.981
I heard I had to come here, man.

05:48.016 --> 05:49.432
- Hey, hold on, hold on.
- The Secret Stash.

05:49.485 --> 05:50.281
Are you Darryl Mcdaniels?

05:50.281 --> 05:51.621
Yeah, yeah, DMC in the place to be.

05:52.025 --> 05:53.608
I heard this is the place to be, man.

05:53.643 --> 05:55.777
Yo, this is DMC of run-DMC.

05:55.812 --> 05:56.879
Oh, yeah, yeah.

05:56.879 --> 05:57.974
Yeah, most people don't know me

05:57.974 --> 05:59.864
'cause I ain't got the glasses on.

05:59.900 --> 06:02.233
This is crazy. I've arrived.

06:02.285 --> 06:03.902
I didn't know you were into comics.

06:03.954 --> 06:06.654
I am comics, man. I am comic books.

06:06.707 --> 06:08.907
Comic books is my whole existence.

06:08.959 --> 06:10.458
It empowers me.

06:10.494 --> 06:13.128
Comic books made me who I am today.

06:13.163 --> 06:14.579
There would be no run-DMC

06:14.631 --> 06:16.831
if it wasn't for comic books.

06:16.883 --> 06:18.500
Really? In our store?

06:18.552 --> 06:19.584
Aw.

06:19.636 --> 06:20.802
I love DMC.

06:20.837 --> 06:22.587
I love run-DMC in general.

06:22.639 --> 06:24.305
But I love DMC, man.

06:24.341 --> 06:26.224
You're talking about two cats who,

06:26.259 --> 06:28.727
along with jam master Jay, had a dream.

06:28.762 --> 06:30.345
Basically they wanted to rap,

06:30.397 --> 06:32.097
and nobody was doing that at that point,

06:32.149 --> 06:33.348
at least not too many people.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.266
They brought rap to the mainstream, man.

06:35.318 --> 06:37.569
Run-DMC, first ever rap artist

06:37.604 --> 06:40.071
<i>to cross over with
Aerosmith with walk this way.</i>

06:40.107 --> 06:42.440
They were the bridge between cultures,

06:42.492 --> 06:44.025
and they became the kings of rock,

06:44.077 --> 06:45.610
as they call themselves.

06:45.662 --> 06:48.446
My whole existence as
a kid was Marvel Comics.

06:48.498 --> 06:51.332
Captain America, the Hulk,
Spider-Man, the Avengers.

06:51.368 --> 06:54.536
Sal Buscema defined my whole childhood.

06:54.588 --> 06:56.421
So me and my brother, we had

06:56.456 --> 06:59.090
this big, huge collection of comic books.

06:59.126 --> 07:01.709
Almost every issue of Marvel, right?

07:01.762 --> 07:03.628
And I can never forget this day.

07:03.680 --> 07:04.879
My brother comes in the room.

07:04.931 --> 07:06.631
He was three years older than me.

07:06.683 --> 07:07.932
And he says, "Darryl,

07:07.968 --> 07:09.801
"we need to get some turntables

07:09.853 --> 07:11.719
and a mixer and some records."

07:11.772 --> 07:13.855
And just by the look on his face,

07:13.890 --> 07:15.723
I saw he was about to say it,

07:15.776 --> 07:18.359
and I was like, "no, don't say it."

07:18.395 --> 07:20.695
And he says, "we have
to do a comic book sale

07:20.730 --> 07:22.280
"and sell some of our comic books

07:22.315 --> 07:23.898
to get some turntables."

07:23.950 --> 07:26.151
<i>That's exactly what
I did to make clerks.</i>

07:26.203 --> 07:27.452
I sold my comics to make...

07:27.487 --> 07:28.820
to follow my passion, my art.

07:28.872 --> 07:30.455
But I never let go of them,

07:30.490 --> 07:31.823
even though I sold them.

07:31.875 --> 07:33.208
You know, obviously, comics infiltrated

07:33.243 --> 07:34.709
my heart and soul.

07:34.744 --> 07:36.161
Sounds like the same thing for him.

07:36.213 --> 07:37.745
Definitely.

07:37.798 --> 07:40.165
I mean, he is ready to
conquer the comics world

07:40.217 --> 07:42.750
like he did the music world.

07:42.803 --> 07:44.335
I'm gonna do a celebration

07:44.387 --> 07:46.588
and a tribute to comic book culture.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.056
So here I am today.

07:48.091 --> 07:49.340
This is for you.

07:49.392 --> 07:50.675
This is for you.

07:50.727 --> 07:52.093
This is for you.

07:52.145 --> 07:54.846
But this right here is issue 1

07:54.898 --> 07:57.182
<i>of the DMC comic book</i>

07:57.234 --> 07:59.400
with the cover drawn

07:59.436 --> 08:02.187
by the one and only Sal Buscema.

08:02.239 --> 08:04.239
There would be no DMC

08:04.274 --> 08:06.274
if it wasn't for Captain America,

08:06.326 --> 08:08.359
the Hulk, Spider-Man, and Iron Man.

08:08.411 --> 08:10.995
And to let y'all know how deep it goes is,

08:11.031 --> 08:12.997
when run, "d, I'm putting
you in my group,

08:13.033 --> 08:14.949
we're gonna make this record,"

08:15.001 --> 08:17.502
I didn't want to get up in
front of y'all and start rhyming.

08:17.537 --> 08:19.170
I didn't want to get up
onstage in front of thousands...

08:19.206 --> 08:21.506
I was a shy little catholic school kid,

08:21.541 --> 08:22.790
geeky, nerd dude.

08:22.843 --> 08:24.676
But what gave me my confidence?

08:24.711 --> 08:26.961
Every time I would hear a beat, I would go,

08:27.013 --> 08:29.097
"hmm, what would the Hulk do?

08:29.132 --> 08:30.348
Crash through walls,

08:30.383 --> 08:31.633
come through floors,

08:31.685 --> 08:33.635
bust through
ceilings and knock...

08:33.687 --> 08:35.186
you know what, comic books gave me

08:35.222 --> 08:36.688
the confidence to get up onstage and rap.

08:36.722 --> 08:38.556
Check this out.

08:38.607 --> 08:40.642
'Cause they said, "come up
with a name for your imprint."

08:40.693 --> 08:42.610
- "Darryl makes comics."
- DMC.

08:42.645 --> 08:43.977
It looks spectacular.

08:44.030 --> 08:46.397
I mean, we would be honored and proud

08:46.449 --> 08:49.200
<i>to carry DMC comics here at the Stash.</i>

08:49.236 --> 08:50.618
Thank you.

08:50.654 --> 08:52.487
I'd be even prouder to hear somebody

08:52.539 --> 08:53.955
taken him on in a battle.

08:53.990 --> 08:56.157
A self-described mc.

08:56.209 --> 08:57.375
Who's that? Who's the mc?

08:57.410 --> 08:58.826
Yeah, who are you talking about?

08:58.879 --> 09:00.712
Shockingly, he's one of these guys

09:00.747 --> 09:03.164
who believes he can rap.

09:03.216 --> 09:04.415
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:04.467 --> 09:05.416
Well, I mean, I've dabbled,

09:05.468 --> 09:06.918
but, I mean, I'm not...

09:06.970 --> 09:08.002
you know, I'm not a legend like you are.

09:08.054 --> 09:09.888
- Oh, no? Really?
- No.

09:09.923 --> 09:11.389
You want to go round for round?

09:11.424 --> 09:12.640
- Pfft!
- I think you should.

09:12.676 --> 09:14.309
- Come on.
- You said...

09:14.344 --> 09:15.510
I mean, what's the worst
thing that could happen?

09:15.562 --> 09:16.928
I'm not kidding around.

09:16.980 --> 09:18.680
He said he wants to be
a professional rapper.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.265
- Really?
- That was his dream.

09:20.317 --> 09:22.517
All right, you know, I've dabbled

09:22.569 --> 09:24.435
in spitting a few rhymes.

09:24.487 --> 09:25.853
Oh.

09:25.906 --> 09:27.855
Look, way two different things.

09:27.908 --> 09:29.324
I agree. I agree.

09:29.359 --> 09:31.075
But these guys start egging me on, though.

09:31.111 --> 09:32.694
And that's living room rapping.

09:32.746 --> 09:35.697
You don't take it to
the king of rock himself.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.115
Well, he didn't take it to him.

09:37.167 --> 09:39.250
We sort of, like, nudged him towards it.

09:39.286 --> 09:40.618
I'll tell you what. Here's what we do.

09:40.670 --> 09:42.620
I got to run an errand real quick.

09:42.672 --> 09:44.172
Here's what we'll do.

09:44.207 --> 09:45.623
I'll come back. We'll go verse for verse.

09:45.675 --> 09:47.041
If you beat me,

09:47.093 --> 09:48.126
I'll put you on a record.

09:48.178 --> 09:51.012
[Laughter]

09:52.766 --> 09:54.132
<i>Got a couple of what if comics</i>

09:54.184 --> 09:55.600
I think maybe you'd be interested in.

09:55.635 --> 09:57.468
<i>Oh, man, loved what ifs.</i>

09:57.520 --> 10:00.355
<i>Mm. I got a special place
in my heart for the what ifs.</i>

10:02.501 --> 10:04.109
Check this out... all
throughout the book,

10:04.109 --> 10:06.243
we wanted to drop little easter eggs.

10:06.278 --> 10:08.299
Could y'all tell me what this is from?

10:08.429 --> 10:10.512
Oh, I recognize that.
You recognize that, Mike?

10:10.564 --> 10:12.731
- Iron Man.
- Exactly, so hold on.

10:12.766 --> 10:15.067
I'm gonna put you on
the spot and go deeper.

10:15.102 --> 10:17.235
Let me see

10:17.271 --> 10:18.904
if this is the real mecca.

10:18.939 --> 10:20.355
Check this out.

10:20.407 --> 10:22.274
Akira.

10:22.326 --> 10:25.110
Oh, that's good. Oh, wow.

10:25.162 --> 10:27.529
- Incredible Hulk.
- Web of Spider-Man.

10:27.581 --> 10:29.081
Oh, wow... okay, okay.

10:29.116 --> 10:31.667
How about this one?

10:31.702 --> 10:33.535
<i>Black Panther, Jungle Tales.</i>

10:33.587 --> 10:34.786
<i>Dark Knight Returns.</i>

10:34.838 --> 10:36.171
Okay, okay, okay.

10:36.206 --> 10:37.422
[Chuckles]

10:37.458 --> 10:39.124
All right, here we go.

10:39.176 --> 10:41.793
<i>Wolverine, X-Men 211, I believe.</i>

10:41.845 --> 10:44.129
- John Romita, Jr.
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

10:44.181 --> 10:46.465
And this one is Daredevil, isn't it?

10:46.517 --> 10:48.350
Oh, man, I ain't getting over on you.

10:48.385 --> 10:49.601
[Laughter]

10:49.637 --> 10:51.186
So y'all official.

10:51.221 --> 10:52.971
You know, I come in here
like I'm all official,

10:53.023 --> 10:55.891
trying to test your...
but that's great, man.

11:05.962 --> 11:06.632
How you doing?

11:06.632 --> 11:07.925
- How's it going, guys?
- What's going on?

11:07.966 --> 11:09.302
<i>I got a couple of what if comics</i>

11:09.302 --> 11:10.597
I think maybe you'd be interested in.

11:10.597 --> 11:11.651
<i>- What if?
- What if.</i>

11:11.651 --> 11:14.254
Oh, my goodness, you know what
we were just doing right now?

11:14.306 --> 11:15.710
Both: A "what if."

11:15.710 --> 11:18.745
Oh, well, I have what if
the Hulk had killed Wolverine?

11:18.797 --> 11:21.998
What if Wolverine had killed the Hulk?

11:22.050 --> 11:24.884
And what if Wolverine
was lord of the vampires?

11:31.893 --> 11:34.177
Mm, do you remember what ifs, Mike?

11:34.229 --> 11:35.895
Oh, man, loved what ifs.

11:35.930 --> 11:37.930
These were real popular back in the day.

11:37.982 --> 11:40.733
<i>But I think what if has kind of,</i>

11:40.769 --> 11:42.485
you know, gone the way of the dinosaur.

11:42.520 --> 11:44.320
Really, you don't hear much about it.

11:44.355 --> 11:47.273
But I got a special place
in my heart for the what ifs.

11:47.325 --> 11:49.442
<i>What if was Marvel's fantasy book.</i>

11:49.494 --> 11:51.661
You know, battling it
out with our imaginations,

11:51.696 --> 11:54.280
asking us the important questions.

11:54.332 --> 11:56.666
<i>What if Wolverine had killed the Hulk?</i>

11:56.701 --> 11:58.367
What if the Hulk had
Bruce Banner's brain?

11:58.420 --> 11:59.669
Oh.

11:59.704 --> 12:01.204
I mean, it was just a great series.

12:01.256 --> 12:02.672
But generally, people were like,

12:02.707 --> 12:05.007
"well, that's... that's
not a real comic.

12:05.043 --> 12:06.375
<i>That's what if," which is ironic,</i>

12:06.428 --> 12:08.344
'cause the stuff that they were like,

12:08.379 --> 12:09.462
"this is a real comic where the Hulk

12:09.514 --> 12:10.930
didn't get killed by Wolverine,"

12:10.965 --> 12:11.931
it's like, "no, that's fake too."

12:11.966 --> 12:14.934
[Laughter]

12:14.969 --> 12:16.185
One of my favorite ones,

12:16.221 --> 12:17.970
which actually came to pass, though,

12:18.022 --> 12:19.522
<i>was, what if Spider-Man
joined the Fantastic Four?</i>

12:19.557 --> 12:20.857
<i>Did you have a favorite what if issue?</i>

12:20.892 --> 12:22.525
<i>I liked the what if the Vision</i>

12:22.560 --> 12:23.976
<i>had destroyed the Avengers?</i>

12:24.028 --> 12:25.812
That's one of my all-time favorites.

12:25.864 --> 12:27.196
<i>What was your favorite what if?</i>

12:27.232 --> 12:28.731
- I never read one.
- Oh, you never...

12:28.783 --> 12:30.149
- You were never into these?
- I never read one, no.

12:30.201 --> 12:31.984
- No. Were they all this serious?
- Oh, yeah.

12:32.036 --> 12:33.870
Where it's like, "what if
so-and-so killed so-and-so?"

12:33.905 --> 12:35.705
Think about it. Comics
can go anywhere.

12:35.740 --> 12:38.958
The only thing they can't do
is really kill their characters.

12:38.993 --> 12:40.376
So the only way you can really do it,

12:40.411 --> 12:41.794
the only way you can tell that story,

12:41.830 --> 12:42.829
<i>is in a what if.</i>

12:42.881 --> 12:44.497
Come on, man.

12:44.549 --> 12:46.415
I'd be like, "what if I
cared about any of this?"

12:46.468 --> 12:48.468
[Laughter]

12:49.036 --> 12:50.585
You're looking to sell these today?

12:50.621 --> 12:51.920
- Yes.
- How come?

12:51.955 --> 12:54.623
Well, I am looking to raise money

12:54.675 --> 12:57.042
to get a video game console
for a local community center,

12:57.094 --> 12:58.677
so the kids can have something to do

12:58.712 --> 12:59.856
and not be out in the street,

12:59.856 --> 13:01.296
getting into who knows
what kind of trouble.

13:01.296 --> 13:03.348
So keep them busy, give
them something to do,

13:03.384 --> 13:04.716
- All right.
- You know?

13:04.768 --> 13:05.967
I mean, did you look up any of the prices

13:06.020 --> 13:07.469
before you got here today?

13:07.521 --> 13:08.470
'Cause you're probably
not looking at...

13:08.522 --> 13:10.389
like, at a Playstation 4

13:10.441 --> 13:12.391
- or an Xbox.
- Definitely not.

13:12.443 --> 13:14.393
You're probably looking
at a... like, at a pong.

13:14.445 --> 13:16.228
- 2600?
- 2600, yeah.

13:16.280 --> 13:17.479
[Laughter]

13:17.531 --> 13:18.480
Those little tiger handhelds.

13:18.532 --> 13:19.948
Yeah.

13:19.983 --> 13:22.367
I mean, what were you
looking to get today?

13:22.403 --> 13:23.902
Well, I was hoping for at least 50.

13:23.954 --> 13:25.370
- Wow.
- Yeah.

13:25.406 --> 13:27.072
Um...

13:27.124 --> 13:29.074
I don't think I could go
that high for these issues.

13:29.126 --> 13:30.409
I mean, it's a great cause,

13:30.461 --> 13:33.795
and because it is a good cause, um...

13:33.831 --> 13:35.414
I could do 25.

13:35.466 --> 13:36.998
You wouldn't go 30?

13:37.051 --> 13:39.251
I could do 28. That's it.

13:39.303 --> 13:40.719
- Oof.
- 28.

13:40.754 --> 13:41.803
All right, sounds good. Sounds good.

13:41.839 --> 13:43.672
- 28?
- 28 sounds good.

13:43.724 --> 13:45.724
Whatever helps, whatever helps.

13:48.812 --> 13:50.178
$28, man.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.646
- All right.
- Thank you.

13:51.682 --> 13:53.815
- Thank you. All right, guys.
- Good luck.

13:53.851 --> 13:55.567
You know what?

13:55.602 --> 13:57.486
<i>They should tap us to be the
writers of what if, right?</i>

13:57.521 --> 13:58.737
That's all we do all day, like you said.

13:58.772 --> 14:00.188
Marvel comes to you.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.773
The editor says, "Ming,
what do you got for me?

14:01.825 --> 14:04.076
<i>First issue, what if relaunch."</i>

14:04.111 --> 14:05.410
Me and Mike on a deserted island.

14:05.446 --> 14:08.697
[Laughter]

14:13.120 --> 14:15.253
Yo, yo, yo, yo. All right, y'all.

14:15.289 --> 14:17.005
Microphone check, one, two.

14:17.040 --> 14:19.541
Let's do this.

14:19.593 --> 14:21.626
First rap battle the stash has ever had.

14:21.678 --> 14:23.011
Yes.

14:23.046 --> 14:26.098
How do you get to rap battle with DMC?

14:26.133 --> 14:27.766
Like, what world is this possible?

14:27.801 --> 14:29.101
Why you?

14:29.136 --> 14:30.685
I have no idea how this happened.

14:30.721 --> 14:32.304
Well, you can't back out, right?

14:32.356 --> 14:34.106
No, I can't back out,
but I'm sitting here...

14:34.141 --> 14:35.557
I was like, is this really happening?

14:35.609 --> 14:37.225
It's just... it's so crazy to me

14:37.277 --> 14:39.194
that all those years I've
been listening to run-DMC,

14:39.229 --> 14:41.863
and whenever they talk about a sucker mc,

14:41.899 --> 14:44.116
like, it's you. [Laughter]

14:44.151 --> 14:45.784
You are who they've been singing about.

14:45.819 --> 14:47.536
Like, you would think
MC meant Ming Chen.

14:47.571 --> 14:49.704
[Laughter]

14:49.740 --> 14:51.239
All right, let's do this the right way.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.041
Can somebody do the intro?

14:53.076 --> 14:54.826
On this side,

14:54.878 --> 14:57.913
you have the pioneer of an entire genre,

14:57.965 --> 15:00.749
one of the most legendary
hip-hop groups of all time,

15:00.801 --> 15:03.885
if not the all-time, run-DMC.

15:03.921 --> 15:06.588
Darryl "DMC" Mcdaniels,

15:06.640 --> 15:07.973
straight out of Hollis.

15:08.008 --> 15:10.509
[Both imitating crowd roaring]

15:10.561 --> 15:13.261
And straight out of his
condo over in Shrewsbury,

15:13.313 --> 15:15.730
because his wife let him
leave the house today,

15:15.766 --> 15:17.349
Ming Chen.

15:17.401 --> 15:18.683
I'm ready when you are, man.

15:18.735 --> 15:20.068
I had this memorized,

15:20.103 --> 15:21.903
but I want to get it smooth, so...

15:21.939 --> 15:23.522
All right, whatever it takes
for you to get the verse out.

15:23.574 --> 15:25.190

least I lost to the best.

18:23.568 --> 18:25.702
Man, like, this sounds like a day

18:25.737 --> 18:27.070
that I actually missed.

18:27.122 --> 18:28.371
Generally speaking,

18:28.406 --> 18:29.872
the adventures that happen around here,

18:29.908 --> 18:31.741
I'm happy to hear you guys tell me about.

18:31.793 --> 18:33.710
But this sounds like a day
I actually would have liked

18:33.745 --> 18:34.911
to have been there, man.

18:34.963 --> 18:37.297
Like, meeting DMC is a cool thing.

18:37.332 --> 18:38.748
Well, hold on.

18:38.800 --> 18:41.417
I know what a big run-DMC fan you are.

18:41.469 --> 18:43.503
I felt really bad that
you weren't there that day,

18:43.555 --> 18:46.306
so planned a little surprise for you, so...

18:46.341 --> 18:47.590
No.

18:47.642 --> 18:49.425
- Stepping up to the mic...
- No!

18:49.477 --> 18:51.144
- The king of rock...
- No!

18:51.179 --> 18:53.396
Mr. DMC himself, Darryl Mcdaniels.

18:53.431 --> 18:55.148
No!

18:55.183 --> 18:56.516
[Laughter]

18:56.568 --> 18:57.517
Oh, my lord.

18:57.569 --> 18:58.651
How are you, man?

18:58.687 --> 19:01.187
Oh, lord.

19:01.239 --> 19:02.689
Oh! [Laughter]

19:02.741 --> 19:04.073
'Cause I know you're the only one

19:04.109 --> 19:06.109
that cared enough to bring him back. Sir.

19:06.161 --> 19:07.660
Hey, what's up, Kev?

19:07.696 --> 19:11.864
Sir, you are absolutely,
have been for 30 years,

19:11.916 --> 19:13.283
one of my biggest heroes.

19:13.335 --> 19:15.168
And one of the things I loved so much

19:15.203 --> 19:16.586
about run-DMC,

19:16.621 --> 19:18.288
still do to this day,

19:18.340 --> 19:21.257
is the declarative "we know who we are."

19:21.293 --> 19:23.009
At age 14,

19:23.044 --> 19:25.094
that was so important
to hear somebody be like,

19:25.130 --> 19:27.347
"I'm the king of rock,
there is none higher."

19:27.382 --> 19:29.432
And you would sit there and be
like, "why can they say that?"

19:29.467 --> 19:32.018
And by the end of the
song, you believed them.

19:32.053 --> 19:35.355
And it was just that kind
of, like, self-assurance, man.

19:35.390 --> 19:37.273
Like, that kind of self-esteem,

19:37.309 --> 19:39.275
like, translated over to me.

19:39.311 --> 19:41.694
<i>And by the time I was ready to make clerks,</i>

19:41.730 --> 19:43.980
it was people like you who did it first.

19:44.032 --> 19:47.483
So, like, you are absolutely
one of my biggest heroes.

19:47.535 --> 19:49.485
Well, thank you, man. I mean, wow.

19:49.537 --> 19:51.120
You know, truth be told,

19:51.156 --> 19:53.406
we didn't want to be
celebrities to the audience.

19:53.458 --> 19:55.241
I think that's the...

19:55.293 --> 19:57.827
you know, people always say,
"run-DMC, they're pioneers,

19:57.879 --> 19:59.462
they're legends," we this and that.

19:59.497 --> 20:02.298
I think one of the most
important things that we did,

20:02.334 --> 20:05.802
when you saw run, d, and
Jay, you saw yourself.

20:05.837 --> 20:07.086
Yes.

20:07.138 --> 20:08.504
When we came into show business,

20:08.556 --> 20:10.923
we said, "why do we
got to change who we are

20:10.975 --> 20:13.393
just to be onstage or be
in front of the camera?"

20:13.428 --> 20:15.645
So when we stepped in front of the world,

20:15.680 --> 20:18.648
kids like you, white,
black, Puerto Rican, Asian,

20:18.683 --> 20:21.818
didn't see something
that they could not be.

20:21.853 --> 20:23.069
Yes.

20:23.104 --> 20:24.604
And they saw themselves. Whoa.

20:24.656 --> 20:25.905
All right, man, so I understand

20:25.940 --> 20:27.857
the king of rock was forced

20:27.909 --> 20:30.576
into some sort of rap
battle with the king of not.

20:30.612 --> 20:32.161
- Yeah, yeah. Well, yeah.
- [Laughter]

20:32.197 --> 20:34.030
We went verse for verse, line for line.

20:34.082 --> 20:36.165
All I got to say to you is this:

20:36.201 --> 20:37.250
Practice.

20:37.285 --> 20:38.323
[Laughter]

20:39.710 --> 20:41.180
Oh! That's all the time we got.

20:41.180 --> 20:42.704
We got to hip-op out of here, man.

20:42.704 --> 20:44.389
For Comic Book Men,
I'm your host Kevin Smith.

20:44.389 --> 20:45.833

20:45.833 --> 20:46.908
Darryl Mcdaniel.

20:46.908 --> 20:48.239

- Ming Chen.

20:48.410 --> 20:50.455

All: And that's the way it is!
