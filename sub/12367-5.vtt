00:02.502 --> 00:03.628
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED

00:03.711 --> 00:06.047
IN FRONT OF A LIVE
STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:06.131 --> 00:08.800
- HEY, NOBODY TOUCHES
THE RESERVATION LIST

00:08.883 --> 00:10.093
BUT THE MAITRE D'.

00:10.176 --> 00:12.595
- BUT THIS IS MY FIRST TRIP
TO L.A.,

00:12.679 --> 00:15.432
AND THIS IS ROBERT REDFORD'S
FAVORITE RESTAURANT.

00:15.515 --> 00:17.642
- AND YOU WANT HIM TO SIGN
YOUR AUTOGRAPH BOOK?

00:17.726 --> 00:21.604
- THAT WOULD BE
MY SECOND CHOICE.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.274
- SORRY, I COULD LOSE
MY JOB.

00:24.357 --> 00:28.820
- JUST A QUICK PEEK.
PLEASE?

00:30.947 --> 00:33.324
- AW...

00:33.408 --> 00:36.286
- THE BEST WAY TO GET OVER A
DIVORCE IS TO MOVE TO CLEVELAND.

00:36.369 --> 00:39.289
- SO ALL YOUR TWEETS ARE TRUE?
- YES!

00:39.372 --> 00:41.791
MEN WHISTLE, THEY HOLD
YOUR DOOR OPEN FOR YOU,

00:41.875 --> 00:44.627
THEY BUY YOU DRINKS,
AND NOT JUST AFTER LAST CALL.

00:44.711 --> 00:48.006
- SOMETIMES DURING THE DAY,
IN NATURAL LIGHT.

00:48.089 --> 00:50.425
- NO, IT'S TRUE.
LIVING IN IOWA...

00:50.508 --> 00:52.427
- OHIO.
- WHATEVER.

00:52.510 --> 00:54.262
IT'S COMPLETELY FREEING.

00:54.345 --> 00:56.264
I MEAN, YOU DON'T HAVE TO OBSESS
ABOUT YOUR LOOKS

00:56.347 --> 00:58.016
OR HOW FAMOUS YOU ARE,

00:58.099 --> 01:00.018
OR STARVE YOURSELF
INTO A SIZE ZERO.

01:00.101 --> 01:03.146
- YOU STILL DO
ALL THOSE THINGS.

01:03.229 --> 01:04.813
- WELL, YES,
BUT I DON'T HAVE TO.

01:04.897 --> 01:06.691
EXCEPT FOR THIS WEEK.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.359
- SHE HASN'T HAD FOOD
FOR FIVE DAYS,

01:08.443 --> 01:10.028
JUST FOR ONE SCENE
IN <i> ALL MY CHILDREN.</i>

01:10.111 --> 01:12.947
- IT'S NOT JUST A SCENE.
IT'S A DEATH SCENE.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.824
A.K.A., EMMY MAGNET.

01:14.908 --> 01:18.119
I'M GONNA BE SEDUCTIVELY SPLAYED
AT THE BOTTOM OF A STAIRCASE,

01:18.203 --> 01:20.163
WEARING NONE BUT A TINY BRA
AND PANTIES,

01:20.246 --> 01:22.040
MAKING A MOVING,
HEARTFELT SPEECH

01:22.123 --> 01:25.794
ABOUT THE FUTILITY
OF FEMALE RIVALRY.

01:25.877 --> 01:27.253
- OH, NO.

01:27.337 --> 01:28.963
IS SUSAN LUCCI
IN THE SCENE WITH YOU?

01:29.047 --> 01:31.674
- YES. BUT THAT SECOND-RATE
LITTLE SOCK PUPPET

01:31.758 --> 01:34.302
BARELY GETS A WORD IN
EDGEWISE.

01:34.385 --> 01:36.346
- WELL, YOU'VE GOTTA
EAT SOMETHING.

01:36.429 --> 01:37.722
AT LEAST TRY THESE
FETAL CARROTS IN FENNEL.

01:37.806 --> 01:39.349
- MM. MM...

01:39.432 --> 01:41.351
- JUST CHEW THEM UP
AND SPIT THEM OUT AGAIN.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.561
- THAT'S DISGUSTING.
- WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

01:43.645 --> 01:48.858
- DON'T TELL ME PEOPLE ARE
STILL SWALLOWING IN CLEVELAND.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.985
- SO WHAT ELSE IS EVERYONE
DOING HERE?

01:51.069 --> 01:52.987
- STEM CELL FACE LIFTS.

01:53.071 --> 01:54.906
BUT THE WAIT LIST IS BRUTAL.

01:54.989 --> 01:58.368
I'LL BE 60 BY THE TIME
I LOOK 30.

01:58.451 --> 01:59.994
AND TOMORROW,
I'M SEEING AN IRIDOLOGIST.

02:00.078 --> 02:03.206
HE LOOKS IN YOUR EYES AND
TELLS YOU WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU.

02:03.289 --> 02:05.542
- MY HUSBAND USED TO DO THAT
FOR FREE.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.043
- CAN I COME WITH YOU?

02:07.126 --> 02:08.877
- JOY, YOU HAVE TO BE
ON SET

02:08.961 --> 02:10.128
TO DO MY HAIR AND MAKEUP.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.173
- ARE YOU GOING
TO THE SET TOO?

02:12.257 --> 02:13.174
- NO, NO.
I'M MEETING THE COUPLE

02:13.258 --> 02:16.469
THAT ARE BUYING MY HOUSE
TOMORROW. CHA-CHING!

02:16.553 --> 02:18.680
- WELL, IF IT ISN'T
OUR OWN LITTLE STALKER.

02:18.763 --> 02:21.182
HAS REDFORD FILED
A RESTRAINING ORDER

02:21.266 --> 02:22.517
AGAINST YOU YET?

02:22.600 --> 02:25.061
- NO, BUT HE'S HAVING LUNCH
HERE TOMORROW.

02:25.144 --> 02:26.062
AND WE ARE TOO!

02:26.145 --> 02:28.898
- ELKA, IT TAKES WEEKS
TO GET A RESERVATION HERE.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.900
- WELL, MAYBE FOR L.A.
GRANNIES

02:30.984 --> 02:33.570
WHO NIP-TUCK
TO MAKE DIMPLES.

02:33.653 --> 02:36.614
CHECK THIS OUT.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.199
- OH...

02:38.283 --> 02:41.411
I'VE NEVER SEEN
NATURAL AGING BEFORE.

02:41.494 --> 02:44.706
- WATCH ME GET THAT OLD FART
WITH ALLY MCBEAL

02:44.789 --> 02:48.126
TO GIVE ME HIS DESSERT.

02:48.209 --> 02:51.421
- I LOVE HOW YOU ALWAYS
SEE MOVIE STARS IN L.A.

02:51.504 --> 02:54.591
- I LOVE HOW THAT HANDSOME GUY
IS CHECKING US OUT.

02:54.674 --> 02:56.926
- OH...
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT,

02:57.010 --> 02:59.178
MAYBE WE ROMANTICIZE CLEVELAND
A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH.

02:59.262 --> 03:03.683
- OR NO.
ON THE OTHER HAND...

03:11.691 --> 03:13.693
{\an8}- [sniffing]

03:13.776 --> 03:15.236
{\an8}- QUIT HUFFING
MY STRAWBERRIES.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.614
{\an8}THERE'S A WHOLE BOWL
RIGHT THERE.

03:17.697 --> 03:19.282
{\an8}- NO, NOT A MORSEL FOR ME.

03:19.365 --> 03:21.075
{\an8}NOT UNTIL AFTER
MY BIG SCENE.

03:21.159 --> 03:25.288
{\an8}- EXCUSE ME.
I'M SORRY.

03:25.371 --> 03:28.625
{\an8}- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
THAT'S LA PERLA GUY!

03:28.708 --> 03:30.084
{\an8}- LA PERLA GUY?

03:30.168 --> 03:31.961
{\an8}YOU MEAN THE GUY
WHO HUMPED AND DUMPED YOU

03:32.045 --> 03:33.838
{\an8}BEFORE WE MOVED TO CLEVELAND?
- YES.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.757
{\an8}I BOUGHT $600 WORTH
OF LINGERIE

03:35.840 --> 03:37.091
{\an8}FOR THAT ONE-NIGHT WONDER,

03:37.175 --> 03:38.593
{\an8}AND HE DOESN'T EVEN
REMEMBER ME.

03:38.676 --> 03:40.345
{\an8}- JOY, THAT IS MICHAEL KNIGHT.

03:40.428 --> 03:41.679
{\an8}HE'S ONE OF THE STARS
OF THIS SHOW.

03:41.763 --> 03:42.931
{\an8}HOW COULD YOU NOT KNOW THAT?

03:43.014 --> 03:45.099
{\an8}- WELL, HE SAID HE WAS
ON SOME SOAP OPERA,

03:45.183 --> 03:46.059
{\an8}AND I JUST PRETENDED
I'D SEEN IT,

03:46.142 --> 03:49.646
{\an8}LIKE I ALWAYS DO WITH YOU.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.814
{\an8}WE WERE SUPPOSED TO GO TO
SANTA BARBARA FOR MY BIRTHDAY,

03:51.898 --> 03:53.024
{\an8}AND HE STOOD ME UP.

03:53.107 --> 03:54.317
{\an8}HE NEVER CAME, NEVER CALLED.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.486
{\an8}I AM SO GONNA RIP HIM
A NEW ONE.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.988
{\an8}- DON'T YOU DARE MAKE A SCENE
UNTIL AFTER MY SCENE!

03:59.072 --> 04:03.868
{\an8}- OH, EXCUSE ME, SIR.

04:03.952 --> 04:08.289
{\an8}VICTORIA...
I THOUGHT YOU WERE A MAN!

04:08.373 --> 04:10.458
{\an8}- AH, SUSAN, I BARELY
NOTICED YOU DOWN THERE.

04:10.541 --> 04:14.253
{\an8}both: MWAH. MWAH.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.839
{\an8}- SUSAN, THIS IS JOY,
MY PERSONAL STYLIST.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.841
{\an8}JOY, THIS IS SUSAN LUCCI.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.385
{\an8}SUSAN'S AN ACTRESS TOO.

04:20.468 --> 04:23.304
{\an8}- MY GOD, YOU'RE GORGEOUS.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.139
{\an8}- OH, THANK YOU.
YOU'RE SO SWEET.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.684
{\an8}WERE YOU EATING THE STRAWBERRIES
WITH YOUR FINGERS?

04:27.767 --> 04:28.851
{\an8}- I'M SORRY.
WAS I STICKY?

04:28.935 --> 04:30.228
{\an8}- WET WIPE!

04:30.311 --> 04:32.647
{\an8}I AM VERY ALLERGIC.

04:32.730 --> 04:34.816
{\an8}I SWELL UP
OUT OF ALL PROPORTION.

04:34.899 --> 04:36.859
{\an8}SPEAKING OF WHICH,

04:36.943 --> 04:41.197
{\an8}YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
AVOID THE BAGELS.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.908
{\an8}- ACTUALLY, I'M DOING
A CLEANSING FAST.

04:43.992 --> 04:47.036
WARDROBE HAS ME
IN THE TINIEST SILK PANTIES.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.163
- OH, DON'T WORRY, I'VE BEEN
SPEAKING TO THE PRODUCERS,

04:49.247 --> 04:50.206
AND THEY'VE CHANGED
YOUR WARDROBE.

04:50.289 --> 04:51.874
- WHAT?

04:51.958 --> 04:54.419
WHAT--WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

04:54.502 --> 04:56.713
- WELL, AS THEY EXPLAINED IT
TO ME,

04:56.796 --> 05:01.050
FOR SUCH A DISTINGUISHED
EMMY WINNER, SUCH AS YOURSELF,

05:01.134 --> 05:03.886
TO JOIN US FOR A
ONE-TIME-ONLY GUEST SHOT,

05:03.970 --> 05:06.347
IT'S PROBABLY HUMILIATING
ENOUGH.

05:06.431 --> 05:09.392
AND IT'S SUCH
A TOUCHING SCENE.

05:09.475 --> 05:13.521
EXPOSING ALL THAT AGING FLESH
WOULD JUST CHEAPEN IT.

05:13.604 --> 05:16.774
OR CAUSE AN UNINTENTIONAL
LAUGH.

05:16.858 --> 05:20.361
- I SEE. HOW VERY CONSIDERATE
OF THEM.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.572
- WELL, I'M SURE YOU WANT TO
RUN DOWN TO HAIR AND MAKEUP

05:22.655 --> 05:23.906
BEFORE THE CAMERA
REHEARSAL.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.075
- I'VE ALREADY DONE
HER HAIR AND MAKEUP.

05:26.159 --> 05:29.370
FULL-BODY MAKEUP.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.748
- WELL, AS I'VE SAID,
THEY'VE CHANGED YOUR SCENE,

05:31.831 --> 05:33.958
JUST A SKOSH.

05:34.042 --> 05:37.587
- [breathing heavily]

05:37.670 --> 05:38.921
IF SHE WERE ANY MORE
OF A BITCH,

05:39.005 --> 05:40.423
SHE'D HAVE PUPPIES.

05:48.473 --> 05:51.768
- DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME
OUT IN THE CAR HONKING?

05:51.851 --> 05:53.770
WE'RE DOING LUNCH
WITH ROBERT REDFORD.

05:53.853 --> 05:54.979
- NO, NOT YET.

05:55.063 --> 05:55.938
THE COUPLE BUYING THE HOUSE
ALSO WANT TO BUY MY FURNITURE.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.816
I'M HAVING A HARD TIME
DECIDING WHAT TO SELL.

05:58.900 --> 06:02.278
- FINE, I'LL DRIVE MYSELF.
- NO.

06:02.361 --> 06:04.155
YOU LOST YOUR L.A.
DRIVING PRIVILEGES

06:04.238 --> 06:06.741
WHEN YOU FLIPPED OFF
TOM HANKS.

06:06.824 --> 06:10.787
- FORREST GUMP DRIVES
LIKE A SOCCER MOM.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.581
- I USED TO BE A SOCCER MOM.

06:13.664 --> 06:15.166
AND A BROWNIE LEADER.

06:15.249 --> 06:16.667
IN FACT JENNA'S TROOP
USED TO MEET

06:16.751 --> 06:17.960
RIGHT AROUND THIS TABLE.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.963
JENNA SAT HERE.
ASHLEY OVER THERE.

06:21.047 --> 06:24.634
BRITNEY B., BRITNEY L.,
BRITNEY R.

06:24.717 --> 06:28.304
OH, BRITNEY L.,
SHE MOVED AWAY TO RESEDA.

06:28.387 --> 06:29.639
WE PROMISED
WE'D KEEP IN TOUCH,

06:29.722 --> 06:33.518
BUT, WELL, YOU KNOW...
RESEDA.

06:33.601 --> 06:36.145
I MEAN, I KNOW THAT I DON'T NEED
ANYTHING IN THIS HOUSE ANYMORE,

06:36.229 --> 06:38.523
BUT JUST EVERYTHING
HAS A MEMORY TO IT.

06:38.606 --> 06:40.691
- OH, SWEETHEART...

06:40.775 --> 06:43.653
I HAVE MEMORIES
OF THIS PLACE TOO.

06:43.736 --> 06:46.322
THIS SPOT RIGHT HERE...

06:46.405 --> 06:49.992
THIS IS WHERE I WAS WHEN
I GOT BORED WITH YOUR STORY.

06:58.626 --> 07:00.795
- HOW CAN I POSSIBLY DELIVER
A DYING SPEECH

07:00.878 --> 07:02.672
FROM A HOSPITAL BED?

07:02.755 --> 07:05.341
THOSE WORDS WERE WRITTEN
FOR A BRA AND PANTIES.

07:05.424 --> 07:07.677
- IT'S STILL A GREAT SPEECH.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.095
YOU REHEARSED IT AT HOME
FULLY DRESSED,

07:09.178 --> 07:11.389
AND THAT LAST LINE
MADE ME CRY EVERY TIME.

07:11.472 --> 07:16.227
- YOU MEAN THE ONE WHERE
I DRAMATICALLY TOSS MY HAIR?

07:16.310 --> 07:18.688
- MAYBE THIS COULD WORK
TO YOUR ADVANTAGE.

07:18.771 --> 07:21.440
AWARD VOTERS LOVE IT
WHEN ACTRESSES ARE BRAVE ENOUGH

07:21.524 --> 07:23.651
TO LOOK HIDEOUS.
- I'M HIDEOUS?

07:23.734 --> 07:25.153
- YES.<i> GOOD</i> HIDEOUS.

07:25.236 --> 07:27.196
YOU KNOW, LIKE CHARLIZE THERON
IN <i> MONSTER.</i>

07:27.280 --> 07:28.281
- OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:28.364 --> 07:31.200
THE JUDGES LOVE IT
WHEN BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE SUFFER.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.161
BUT I DIDN'T STARVE MYSELF
FOR NOTHING.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.163
HELP ME LOOSEN
THESE BLANKETS.

07:35.246 --> 07:36.706
AT LEAST I CAN
SHOW A LITTLE LEG

07:36.789 --> 07:40.334
WHERE THEY ATTACHED
THE CATHETER.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.879
- VICTORIA, I THOUGHT WE SHOULD
GO OVER THE NEW PAGES

07:42.962 --> 07:45.381
BEFORE WE SHOOT.
- NEW PAGES?

07:45.464 --> 07:48.509
YOU DIDN'T CHANGE MY SPEECH?
- JUST A PINCH.

07:48.593 --> 07:51.429
OH, AND THE WRITERS JUST FELT
IT MADE MORE SENSE

07:51.512 --> 07:53.514
COMING FROM ME.

07:53.598 --> 07:58.519
- YOU CONNIVING LITTLE
TEA CUP POODLE!

07:58.603 --> 07:59.937
YOU PLANNED THIS ALL ALONG.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.772
- OH, COME ON, VICTORIA.

08:01.856 --> 08:04.150
JUST PRETEND IT'S
A SPECIAL EPISODE OF

08:04.233 --> 08:07.403
"THE BALD AND THE BEAUTIFUL."

08:07.486 --> 08:11.157
- LAUGH!
[laughter]

08:13.492 --> 08:19.123
I KNOW YOU CAN'T SPEAK,
BUT I...

08:19.207 --> 08:21.250
I PRAY THAT YOU CAN
HEAR ME.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.377
- MMMM...

08:26.088 --> 08:29.091
- SEEING YOU
IN THIS MISERABLE STATE,

08:29.175 --> 08:31.594
I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL
PARTLY RESPONSIBLE.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.429
- MM-HMM.

08:34.514 --> 08:38.308
- IF ONLY I'D BEEN THERE
TO WARN YOU

08:38.392 --> 08:40.770
THAT LIZA HAS SABOTAGED
THE STAIRWAY.

08:40.852 --> 08:42.605
- I FORGIVE YOU.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.733
- CUT! SHE'S TALKING AGAIN.

08:47.818 --> 08:48.986
- YOU KNOW,
I WAS JUST THINKING

08:49.070 --> 08:50.613
HOW MUCH THE VIEWERS
WOULD LOVE IT

08:50.696 --> 08:53.241
IF I SUDDENLY WOKE UP RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF SUSAN'S SPEECH.

08:53.324 --> 08:55.993
- YOU KNOW, IF VICTORIA'S
NOT HAPPY WITH HER PART,

08:56.077 --> 08:57.411
WE COULD JUST SEND HER HOME

08:57.495 --> 08:59.372
AND SLAP SOME LIPSTICK
ON A COCONUT.

08:59.455 --> 09:01.123
NO ONE WOULD KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.793
- I THINK PEOPLE WOULD
KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

09:03.876 --> 09:05.920
BETWEEN ME AND A COCONUT.

09:06.003 --> 09:09.131
- OH. WE COULD AGE
THE COCONUT.

09:11.884 --> 09:15.763
I KNOW YOU...CAN'T SPEAK...

09:15.846 --> 09:21.227
BUT I--BUT I PRAY
THAT YOU CAN HEAR ME.

09:21.310 --> 09:23.980
- MMMM...

09:24.063 --> 09:26.357
- REST, DEAR FRIEND.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.776
IF ONLY I HAD BEEN THERE
TO WARN YOU

09:28.859 --> 09:31.195
THAT LIZA HAD SABOTAGED
THE STAIRWAY.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.655
- [indistinct mumble]

09:32.738 --> 09:36.158
- WHY DID WE ALWAYS LET
PETTY JEALOUSY

09:36.242 --> 09:38.661
BLIND US TO WHAT'S
REALLY IMPORTANT?

09:38.744 --> 09:40.204
LOVE...
- [muted mumble]

09:40.288 --> 09:41.664
- COMPASSION...
- [muted mumble]

09:41.747 --> 09:44.166
- FRIENDSHIP.
OW!

09:44.250 --> 09:45.376
SHE BIT ME!

09:51.716 --> 09:53.092
- THE MAITRE D' SAID
HIS ASSISTANT

09:53.175 --> 09:54.510
JUST CALLED AND CANCELLED.

09:54.593 --> 09:57.221
WE DO NOT KNOW WHERE
MR. REDFORD IS EATING NOW.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.307
- WELL, YOU BETTER FIND OUT.

09:59.390 --> 10:02.685
UNLESS YOU WANT ME TO GO
ALL CHARLIE SHEEN ON THIS DUMP.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.230
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,

10:06.314 --> 10:07.857
I MAY HAVE HEARD SOMETHING
ABOUT HIM

10:07.940 --> 10:09.275
BEING ON <i> JIMMY KIMMEL</i> TONIGHT.

10:09.358 --> 10:10.401
- LET'S ROLL.

10:10.484 --> 10:12.403
- ELKA, ELKA...

10:12.486 --> 10:13.863
I CAN'T DRIVE YOU
TO <i> KIMMEL.</i>

10:13.946 --> 10:15.364
I'M MEETING THE COUPLE
THAT ARE BUYING MY HOUSE.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.325
- FINE!

10:17.408 --> 10:19.869
I'LL GET <i> DIE HARD</i>
OVER THERE TO TAKE ME.

10:19.952 --> 10:22.079
HEY, BALDY, WAIT UP.

10:24.248 --> 10:26.417
- "IT WASN'T ME
YOU PULLED FROM THE WRECKAGE.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.753
"IT WAS MY TWIN BROTHER ALEX.

10:28.836 --> 10:30.379
"HE WE IMPERSONATING ME
TO GET CONTROL

10:30.463 --> 10:32.048
OF CHANDLER ENTERPRISES."

10:32.131 --> 10:34.884
- "THEN IT WAS ALEX'S ASHES
I SCATTERED AT SEA."

10:34.967 --> 10:36.719
- EXCUSE ME.

10:36.802 --> 10:39.221
- OH, CRAP!
- WHAT?

10:39.305 --> 10:40.431
- IT'S A BLAST
FROM MY PAST.

10:40.514 --> 10:42.725
- EXCUSE ME.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.560
YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T
REMEMBER ME,

10:44.644 --> 10:46.687
SO LET ME REINTRODUCE MYSELF.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.356
I'M THE WOMAN WHO'S ABOUT
TO RIP THE BLUE

10:48.439 --> 10:49.899
RIGHT OUT OF YOUR EYES.

10:49.982 --> 10:53.694
- SLOW DOWN. YOU'RE RIGHT,
I DON'T REMEMBER YOU.

10:53.778 --> 10:56.280
WHICH IS ODD BECAUSE
GORGEOUS, CRAZY WOMEN

10:56.364 --> 10:57.865
ARE USUALLY SO HARD
TO FORGET.

10:57.948 --> 11:00.743
- CRAZY WAS FALLING
FOR YOUR LINE AT SKY BAR

11:00.826 --> 11:03.746
INSTEAD OF TASERING YOU
IN YOUR JACKSON POLLOCKS!

11:03.829 --> 11:05.956
BOLLOCKS!
IT'S RHYMING SLANG.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.084
I'M ENGLISH.
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS!

11:08.167 --> 11:11.587
- DID YOU SAY SKY BAR?
- UH-HUH.

11:11.670 --> 11:15.466
- GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE'S DOING IT AGAIN.

11:15.549 --> 11:19.095
LOOK, MISS, THIS IS GONNA SOUND
A LITTLE NUTSY,

11:19.178 --> 11:22.056
BUT IT WASN'T ME YOU MET.
IT WAS MY BROTHER.

11:22.139 --> 11:25.601
- BROTHER?
- MY TWIN BROTHER ALEX.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.105
- OH, PLEASE.

11:29.188 --> 11:30.648
YOU SERIOUSLY EXPECT ME
TO BELIEVE

11:30.731 --> 11:31.816
YOU HAVE AN EVIL TWIN?

11:31.899 --> 11:33.275
- IT'S TRUE.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.778
SOMETIMES I CAN'T EVEN
TELL 'EM APART.

11:35.861 --> 11:39.615
- YOU SEE, ALEX IS JEALOUS
OF MY FAME,

11:39.698 --> 11:43.452
SO HE USES MY NAME
TO...PICK UP MODELS.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.664
- OH, COME ON!

11:46.747 --> 11:52.002
I MEAN...I HARDLY LOOK
LIKE A MODEL.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.255
- WELL, I JUST ASSUMED.

11:54.338 --> 11:56.966
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THE WORST PART IS?

11:57.049 --> 11:58.968
ALEX IS OBVIOUSLY
OUT THERE SOMEWHERE

11:59.051 --> 12:00.803
PICKING UP WOMEN
I'D BE TOO INTIMIDATED

12:00.886 --> 12:03.139
TO EVEN TALK TO.

12:03.222 --> 12:06.517
- WELL, I THINK YOU'RE BEING
A LITTLE HARD ON YOURSELF.

12:06.600 --> 12:10.479
- JOY. JOY, CODE BLUE.
I NEED YOU.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.148
- OH, I HAVE TO GO.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.608
BUT MAYBE WE CAN
TALK SOME MORE LATER?

12:14.692 --> 12:16.152
- YOU CAN COUNT ON IT.

12:20.239 --> 12:23.784
- YOU REALLY SHOULD TEACH.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.828
- WHY ARE YOU STILL
DRESSED LIKE THAT?

12:25.911 --> 12:27.496
- OH, LUCCI KEEPS RUINING
OUR SCENE,

12:27.580 --> 12:28.789
SO WE'RE RE-SHOOTING
AFTER LUNCH.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.791
WHICH MEANS THAT
WE ONLY HAVE AN HOUR

12:30.875 --> 12:33.002
TO CREATE A DEVIOUS
RETALIATION PLAN,

12:33.085 --> 12:34.670
SO BRILLIANTLY CONVOLUTED

12:34.753 --> 12:36.172
THEY CAN NEVER
TRACE IT BACK TO ME.

12:36.255 --> 12:38.883
- OR ME.

12:38.966 --> 12:41.135
- THAT'S GONNA RULE OUT
A LOT OF PLANS.

12:41.218 --> 12:43.304
COME ON.

12:49.435 --> 12:52.354
- UH, EXCUSE ME,

12:52.438 --> 12:55.232
WHERE DOES MR. KIMMEL
KEEP HIS GUEST STARS?

12:55.316 --> 12:57.818
- OH, I'M SORRY, YOU'RE NOT
ALLOWED TO BE BACK HERE.

12:57.902 --> 13:00.779
- PRETTY PLEASE?

13:00.863 --> 13:02.740
- AW...

13:02.823 --> 13:06.160
THE GREEN ROOM IS
RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.

13:06.243 --> 13:08.913
- THANK YOU.
BRING ME A DIET COKE. NO ICE.

13:08.996 --> 13:11.207
AND IF SOME RUM
FOUND ITS WAY IN THERE,

13:11.290 --> 13:13.876
THAT'D BE OKAY.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.419
- AND HERE WE ARE,
BACK IN THE KITCHEN AGAIN.

13:15.503 --> 13:16.712
- OH, WE LOVE IT!

13:16.795 --> 13:18.881
- WE CANNOT WAIT
TO MOVE IN.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.174
- I JUST LOVE ALL THESE
LITTLE DETAILS.

13:20.257 --> 13:21.884
- BUT LIKE I SAID EARLIER,

13:21.967 --> 13:24.011
I CAN'T REALLY PART
WITH ANY OF THIS STUFF EITHER.

13:24.094 --> 13:25.304
- OH, THE REAL ESTATE AGENT SAID
YOU WANTED TO SELL

13:25.387 --> 13:26.680
THE CONTENTS OF THE HOUSE.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.098
- WELL, SURE,
WHEN YOU SAY "CONTENTS,"

13:28.182 --> 13:29.475
I WANT TO SELL 'EM.

13:29.558 --> 13:32.228
BUT WHEN IT COMES DOWN
TO THE ACTUAL <i> THINGS--</i>

13:32.311 --> 13:35.689
LIKE THE DRAPES THAT
MY SON WILL ALWAYS HID BEHIND

13:35.773 --> 13:36.774
WHENEVER WE PLAYED
HIDE AND SEEK,

13:36.857 --> 13:38.400
AND I USED TO HAVE
TO PRETEND

13:38.484 --> 13:39.443
THAT I DIDN'T SEE
HIS LITTLE TOES

13:39.527 --> 13:41.362
PEEKING OUT FROM UNDER

13:41.445 --> 13:44.073
NOT FOR SALE.

13:44.156 --> 13:47.034
- WOW, IT'S NICE YOU HAVE
SO MANY HAPPY MEMORIES HERE.

13:47.117 --> 13:47.910
- WE THOUGHT YOU WERE
SELLING THE HOUSE

13:47.993 --> 13:48.911
BECAUSE YOU GOT A DIVORCE.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.454
- STEVE!
- NO, NO.

13:50.538 --> 13:52.081
IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.

13:52.164 --> 13:53.874
MOST OF MY HAPPY MEMORIES ARE
BETWEEN ME AND MY KIDS.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.918
MY HUSBAND WAS
RARELY HOME.

13:56.001 --> 13:59.797
- YEAH, I KNOW
WHAT THAT'S LIKE.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.132
- HONEY, I HAVE TO WORK.

14:02.216 --> 14:05.052
- I WORK TOO.

14:05.135 --> 14:07.429
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
WE HAD OTHER PROBLEMS.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.890
BUT ACTUALLY, I USED TO LOVE
MY ALONE TIME.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.892
I COULD READ A BOOK,
RELAX, HAVE A GLASS OF WINE.

14:11.976 --> 14:16.105
THIS LITTLE BABY
CHILLS 20 BOTTLES AT ONCE!

14:16.188 --> 14:18.107
- WELL, GOOD, 'CAUSE
THIS LITTLE BABY

14:18.190 --> 14:21.026
CAN REALLY KNOCK 'EM BACK.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.947
- WELL, IT DOES HELP
KILL THE TIME

14:25.030 --> 14:28.075
WHEN I'M HOME ALONE
WITH NOTHING TO DO.

14:28.158 --> 14:29.618
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU'LL HAVE PLENTY TO DO

14:29.702 --> 14:30.953
WHEN YOU HAVE KIDS.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.413
THIS HOUSE WAS MADE
FOR KIDS.

14:32.496 --> 14:34.957
- OH, WE'RE NOT HAVING
CHILDREN.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.293
- WELL, NEVER SAY NEVER.

14:37.376 --> 14:38.961
- I THOUGHT WE AGREED.

14:39.044 --> 14:41.088
- NO, NO, NO.
YOU AND YOUR THERAPIST AGREED.

14:41.171 --> 14:43.132
I JUST STOPPED ARGUING.

14:43.215 --> 14:46.176
- HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT EVERYONE
CAN AGREE ON?

14:46.260 --> 14:47.469
TRASH COMPACTORS.

14:47.553 --> 14:50.139
WHO DOESN'T WANT
SMALLER TRASH?

14:50.222 --> 14:51.974
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
STILL THINKING ABOUT KIDS.

14:52.057 --> 14:53.809
- WHY DO YOU THINK I WANTED
A HOUSE WITH SO MANY ROOMS?

14:53.892 --> 14:56.103
- SO WE WOULDN'T BE
ON TOP OF EACH OTHER.

14:56.186 --> 14:57.313
- I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT
ME BEING ON TOP OF YOU

14:57.396 --> 14:58.939
WAS SUCH A DRAG.

14:59.023 --> 15:02.693
- IT IS IF YOU'RE ONLY THERE
TO MAKE BABIES.

15:02.776 --> 15:05.654
- YOU KNOW WHAT'S
REALLY FUN TO MAKE?

15:05.738 --> 15:08.032
MICROWAVE POPCORN.

15:08.115 --> 15:10.034
ESPECIALLY FOR FAMILY
MOVIE NIGHT.

15:10.117 --> 15:12.036
OR NOT FAMILY.

15:12.119 --> 15:13.954
IT COULD BE
COUPLE MOVIE NIGHT.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.831
YOU KNOW, EVEN BETTER.

15:15.914 --> 15:18.959
WELL, YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU'RE HOME.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.669
ALTHOUGH MOVIES ARE ALSO
A LOT OF FUN ALONE.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.755
ESPECIALLY 'CAUSE
YOU LIKE TO DRINK.

15:26.425 --> 15:27.676
- THANKS. BUT YOU KNOW,

15:27.760 --> 15:30.971
YOU HAVE REALLY
OPENED MY EYES.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.349
TURNS OUT WE WON'T BE
NEEDING THE HOUSE AFTER ALL.

15:33.432 --> 15:37.853
- THERE YOU GO AGAIN,
SPEAKING FOR THE BOTH OF US.

15:37.936 --> 15:39.980
YEAH, SHE'S PROBABLY RIGHT.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.857
WE'RE NOT GONNA NEED
THE HOUSE.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.164
- I REALLY THINK
THIS IS A BAD IDEA.

15:57.247 --> 15:58.123
- YEAH, WELL,
YOU'RE NOT HERE TO THINK.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.084
YOU'RE HERE TO BE MY LOOKOUT.
STRAWBERRY.

16:00.167 --> 16:01.710
- YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW ALLERGIC SHE IS.

16:01.794 --> 16:02.920
WHAT IF THIS KILLS HER?

16:03.003 --> 16:07.007
- STOP SAYING THINGS
I WANT TO HEAR.

16:07.091 --> 16:08.967
ONCE SHE DABS HER EYES
WITH THIS,

16:09.051 --> 16:10.719
SHE'LL REALLY HAVE SOMETHING
TO CRY ABOUT.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.055
- SOMEONE'S COMING.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.223
HIDE!

16:20.854 --> 16:22.272
I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.

16:22.356 --> 16:23.732
- MAYBE THEY WENT
THE OTHER WAY.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.776
YOU TAKE A PEEK.

16:27.569 --> 16:30.572
WHAT'S WRONG?
- WE'RE LOCKED IN.

16:33.992 --> 16:36.078
- WELL, WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW
FOR YOU TONIGHT.

16:36.161 --> 16:37.913
GEORGE CLOONEY WILL
BE HERE TONIGHT.

16:37.996 --> 16:40.207
[cheers and applause]

16:40.290 --> 16:42.793
HE, UM...

16:42.876 --> 16:45.754
HE HAD NOWHERE ELSE TO GO,
SO HE DECIDED TO COME HERE.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.881
AND--

16:47.965 --> 16:49.925
WELL, I DIDN'T--

16:50.008 --> 16:53.429
I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS THAT FUNNY, BUT, UM...

16:53.512 --> 16:55.597
WE ALSO, TONIGHT,
WILL HAVE A PERFORMANCE--

16:55.681 --> 16:59.226
HELLO.
- WHERE'S ROBERT REDFORD?

16:59.309 --> 17:01.311
- I DON'T KNOW WHERE
ROBERT REDFORD IS.

17:01.395 --> 17:03.105
WHO ARE YOU?

17:03.188 --> 17:04.772
- ELKA OSTROVSKY.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.608
I WAS TOLD ROBERT REDFORD
WAS A GUEST TONIGHT.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.154
- I SHOULD PROBABLY POINT OUT
THAT THIS IS NOT A BIT.

17:10.237 --> 17:11.946
THIS IS A STRANGE WOMAN
THAT HAS

17:12.030 --> 17:12.948
WANDERED UP ONTO THE STAGE.

17:13.031 --> 17:15.992
THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING
SECURITY, GUILLERMO.

17:16.076 --> 17:19.747
WHERE ARE YOU FROM, HE SAYS,
HOPING YOU'RE NOT ARMED.

17:19.829 --> 17:23.584
- I'M FROM CLEVELAND, OHIO,
THE GREATEST CITY IN THE WORLD.

17:23.666 --> 17:25.461
[small applause]
- OH. ALL RIGHT.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.963
- I SAID THE GREATEST CITY
IN THE WORLD!

17:28.047 --> 17:30.299
[enthusiastic applause]

17:30.382 --> 17:32.468
- THAT'S, UM...

17:32.551 --> 17:34.303
WELL, YOU KNOW, I'D LOVE
TO CHAT MORE, ELKA, BUT--

17:34.386 --> 17:35.804
- WELL, THEN,
I GOTTA SIT DOWN.

17:35.888 --> 17:39.975
- UH, YEAH, THAT SEAT IS
ACTUALLY RESERVED

17:40.058 --> 17:41.268
FOR GEORGE CLOONEY.

17:41.351 --> 17:44.146
- OH, THERE'S ROOM FOR TWO.

17:44.229 --> 17:45.814
- ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S FINE, THEN.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.483
I GUESS THERE IS ROOM
FOR TWO.

17:47.566 --> 17:50.319
SERIOUSLY, THOUGH, I MEAN...

17:50.402 --> 17:52.488
YOU KNOW GEORGE CLOONEY'S
IN THE GREEN ROOM, RIGHT?

17:52.571 --> 17:54.656
YOU'RE OKAY WITH
CLEVELAND GRANNY BEING HERE?

17:54.740 --> 17:58.619
[cheers and applause]
ALL RIGHT.

17:58.702 --> 18:04.166
- SO DID ROBERT REDFORD
EVER SIT IN THIS CHAIR?

18:04.249 --> 18:06.335
- AS A MATTER OF FACT,
YES, HE DID.

18:06.418 --> 18:09.505
- GIVE ME A MINUTE.

18:17.888 --> 18:19.389
- HOW WAS IT?
- [chuckles]

18:19.473 --> 18:22.518
IT WAS FINE FOR ME.
[laughter]

18:22.601 --> 18:25.020
- PRETTY GOOD
FOR THE CHAIR TOO, I THINK.

18:25.103 --> 18:27.314
- YOUNG MAN.

18:27.397 --> 18:30.025
COULD YOU GET A CLOSE-UP
OF THIS?

18:30.108 --> 18:34.655
audience: AWW...

18:34.738 --> 18:37.866
IF ANYONE OUT THERE KNOWS
WHERE ROBERT REDFORD IS,

18:37.950 --> 18:41.036
MY CELL PHONE NUMBER IS
216--

18:41.119 --> 18:42.079
- HEY, WE'RE GONNA BE
RIGHT BACK!

18:42.162 --> 18:48.085
[cheers and applause]

18:48.168 --> 18:50.546
- THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.381
- LET'S JUST BANG
ON THE DOOR.

18:52.464 --> 18:53.549
SOMEONE WILL HEAR US
AND LET US OUT.

18:53.632 --> 18:54.716
- ARE YOU CRAZY?

18:54.800 --> 18:56.760
IF THEY FIND US IN HERE,
THEY'LL KNOW YOU WERE THE ONE

18:56.844 --> 18:59.263
WHO POISONED SUSAN'S KLEENEX.
- IT WAS YOU!

18:59.346 --> 19:01.723
- NOW ISN'T THE TIME
FOR FINGER POINTING.

19:01.807 --> 19:06.228
I KNOW, I'LL BOOST YOU OVER
THE TOP OF THAT WALL.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.856
OH, FINE, YOU CAN
GIVE ME A BOOST.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.569
- OKAY, SUSAN,
I JUST NEED SOME REACTION SHOTS

19:13.652 --> 19:14.903
TO INTERCUT
WITH THE DREAM SEQUENCE.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.572
- RIGHT.

19:16.655 --> 19:18.574
- YOU'RE REMEMBERING
THE PLANE CRASH.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.868
YOU'RE LYING IN THE WRECKAGE.

19:20.951 --> 19:23.078
A DIM FIGURE HOVERS
ABOVE YOU.

19:23.161 --> 19:25.706
YOU WAKE UP HORRIFIED.

19:25.789 --> 19:29.209
- AAH!

19:44.516 --> 19:46.894
- OH, ELKA, I THINK
I BLEW THE SALE!

19:46.977 --> 19:48.437
- WHO CARES!

19:48.520 --> 19:50.606
I FOUND OUT WHERE
ROBERT REDFORD IS.

19:50.689 --> 19:55.068
- HIDE ME. I THINK I KILLED
SUSAN LUCCI.

19:55.152 --> 19:57.821
- OH, MY GOD!
WHERE'S JOY?

20:01.033 --> 20:05.287
- WOULD SOMEBODY PLEASE
LET ME OUT!

20:09.041 --> 20:12.127
OH, IT'S YOU.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.921
[music fades in]

20:14.004 --> 20:16.131
AND THERE'S MUSIC.

20:16.214 --> 20:18.842
- YEAH, THEY'RE REHEARSING
MUSIC CUES NEXT DOOR.

20:18.926 --> 20:21.261
YOU KNOW, IT KIND OF
MAKES ME WANT TO

20:21.345 --> 20:22.971
SWEEP YOU OFF YOUR FEET

20:23.055 --> 20:24.598
AND CARRY YOU
UP TO MY DRESSING ROOM.

20:24.681 --> 20:29.186
- WELL...IF THAT'S WHAT
THE SCENE CALLS FOR.

20:29.269 --> 20:32.522
[suspenseful music tones]

20:32.606 --> 20:35.400
THAT DIDN'T SOUND RIGHT.
