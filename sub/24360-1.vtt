[Man] Hey, man.

00:53.561 --> 00:55.770
This one here.

00:55.772 --> 00:56.603
(echoed whispering)

00:56.605 --> 00:57.605
You hear that?

00:57.607 --> 00:58.438
(echoed squeaking)

00:58.440 --> 00:59.275
Oh shit.

(moaning and heavy breathing)

03:10.949 --> 03:11.948
Whoa.

03:11.950 --> 03:12.990
What the fuck?

03:12.992 --> 03:13.991
What the hell do you want?

03:13.993 --> 03:14.950
Don't stop now.

03:14.952 --> 03:15.911
We were just enjoying the show.

03:18.456 --> 03:21.417
You can join in if you want.

03:22.167 --> 03:23.835
Wait, what the fuck is this?

03:23.837 --> 03:24.836
Knock it off, Joan.

03:24.838 --> 03:25.878
We're here for work.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.879
[Joan] Shut it, Miles.

03:27.881 --> 03:29.632
[Derek] Well, what's
going on here, huh?

03:29.634 --> 03:30.425
(laughing)

03:30.427 --> 03:31.592
Hey, hurry up.
I'm hungry.

03:31.594 --> 03:33.844
Listen, listen, you guys
are wasting your time.

03:33.846 --> 03:35.346
If this is some sort of
home invasion or something,

03:35.348 --> 03:36.889
I don't have any valuables.

03:36.891 --> 03:39.393
Frank doesn't like it when
people don't pay their debts.

03:42.439 --> 03:43.273
Fuck me.

03:44.606 --> 03:45.774
Listen, listen, okay.

03:47.277 --> 03:49.402
I told him the other day, I
don't have that kind of cash.

03:49.404 --> 03:50.402
I just need a few more days.

03:50.404 --> 03:52.572
I'll get it to you tomorrow.

03:52.574 --> 03:53.531
I swear to God.

03:53.533 --> 03:55.991
You better or I'm coming back.

03:55.993 --> 03:57.745
[Man] Okay, okay, I promise.

04:02.291 --> 04:03.125
See?

04:04.168 --> 04:05.003
Easy.

04:06.379 --> 04:07.464
Fucking bitch.

04:08.380 --> 04:09.463
(gun firing)
(intense orchestral music)

04:09.465 --> 04:10.467
(screaming)

04:15.304 --> 04:17.055
What the fuck are you doing?

04:17.057 --> 04:19.307
I was letting you
handle it your way.

04:19.309 --> 04:20.807
I got a 200-pound
man coming at me

04:20.809 --> 04:23.644
and you're just standing there
with your dick in your hand?

04:23.646 --> 04:25.398
Okay, what do you
wanna do with the broad?

04:34.449 --> 04:36.990
Forget about what
you've seen here.

04:36.992 --> 04:38.911
This never happened.

04:39.996 --> 04:40.830
Got it?

04:41.497 --> 04:42.331
[Woman] Yeah.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.083
Good.

04:46.001 --> 04:47.002
Let her go.

04:53.468 --> 04:57.179
(dramatic atmospheric music)

05:02.309 --> 05:03.350
I like these.

05:03.352 --> 05:04.187
Nice.

05:08.857 --> 05:10.190
It's okay, it's okay.

05:10.192 --> 05:11.776
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

05:11.778 --> 05:12.862
Having a little fun.

05:13.987 --> 05:14.822
Come on.

05:15.989 --> 05:16.990
You can go.

05:21.121 --> 05:22.956
What's the matter with you?

05:24.081 --> 05:26.749
We're here to do a
job and get outta here.

05:26.751 --> 05:27.874
Uh-huh.

05:27.876 --> 05:30.043
Or do you wanna wait around
for the cops to show up?

05:30.045 --> 05:31.670
No.

05:31.672 --> 05:33.047
Good.

05:33.049 --> 05:34.382
Let's roll.

05:34.384 --> 05:35.218
Fucking cunt.

05:37.261 --> 05:38.677
What?

05:38.679 --> 05:40.053
What did you just say?

05:40.055 --> 05:41.515
I said I'm fucking hungry.

05:43.643 --> 05:44.852
I heard what you said.

05:46.062 --> 05:47.687
You ever have
a threesome, hmm?

05:47.689 --> 05:48.562
Those are fun.

05:48.564 --> 05:50.064
Yeah.

05:50.066 --> 05:51.858
I had a threesome
one time, in prison.

05:51.860 --> 05:52.858
Are you serious?

05:52.860 --> 05:53.861
He is.

05:54.737 --> 05:56.528
I never had one though.

05:56.530 --> 05:57.530
(phone buzzing)

05:57.532 --> 05:58.363
First time for everything.

05:58.365 --> 05:59.740
Yeah.

05:59.742 --> 06:01.033
Hey, Anson.

06:01.035 --> 06:02.285
We're gonna need a
clean-up crew here.

06:02.287 --> 06:03.287
We got a body.

06:03.579 --> 06:06.079
(gun firing)
(body thudding)

06:06.081 --> 06:07.332
Yeah, make that two bodies.

06:08.585 --> 06:09.836
All right, thanks.

06:13.256 --> 06:15.173
What are you
standing there for?

06:15.175 --> 06:16.009
Let's go.

06:19.470 --> 06:20.386
See you later.

06:20.388 --> 06:21.388
Maybe...

06:22.766 --> 06:25.684
(hip hop music)

06:48.708 --> 06:51.709
What's up, dog?
What you got?

06:51.711 --> 06:55.797
Give me the usual,
a bottle of whiskey.

06:55.799 --> 06:57.258
♪ ♪

07:11.271 --> 07:14.483
Hey, can I get three
shot glasses, please?

07:21.324 --> 07:23.826
(dance music)

07:31.835 --> 07:33.625
Another job well done.

07:33.627 --> 07:35.754
Oh, is that what it was?

07:37.090 --> 07:39.592
What's that supposed to mean?

07:44.263 --> 07:45.348
Oh, really?

07:48.809 --> 07:50.562
Hey, where'd she go?

07:55.984 --> 07:57.274
[Miles] Aw shit.

07:57.276 --> 07:59.026
What's wrong?

07:59.028 --> 08:01.112
Joan's ex just showed up.

08:01.114 --> 08:02.697
Yeah, so what?

08:02.699 --> 08:04.824
[Miles] So, she's
got a hard on for him.

08:04.826 --> 08:05.699
This should be good.

08:05.701 --> 08:06.492
[Derek] Oh shit.

08:06.494 --> 08:08.747
(laughing)

08:24.220 --> 08:27.223
[Anthony] Just
give me one moment.

08:30.100 --> 08:32.143
Long time, no see.

08:32.145 --> 08:33.395
How you been?

08:34.313 --> 08:37.067
Good, good, I've been good.

08:37.775 --> 08:38.775
You?

08:39.400 --> 08:40.235
Great.

08:49.536 --> 08:51.288
I miss you, Anthony.

08:59.088 --> 09:01.214
I should really get going.

09:01.216 --> 09:02.965
It was nice seeing you.

09:02.967 --> 09:03.843
Anthony.

09:05.511 --> 09:11.101
Just like Saint Anthony,
finder of lost things.

09:13.602 --> 09:15.896
I think I've lost something.

09:17.607 --> 09:19.608
Can you help me find it?

09:22.112 --> 09:23.820
Excuse me.

09:23.822 --> 09:25.446
Is this slut bothering you?

09:25.448 --> 09:26.655
Um.

09:26.657 --> 09:28.908
We're having a moment here.

09:28.910 --> 09:30.661
He's not interested.

09:32.122 --> 09:33.622
Back off, bitch.

09:36.083 --> 09:38.918
Oh, ooh, I'm scared.

09:38.920 --> 09:40.503
Come on.

09:40.505 --> 09:42.756
(laughing)

09:44.883 --> 09:47.970
You should teach your new
girlfriend some manners.

09:58.647 --> 10:00.816
What was that all about?

10:02.694 --> 10:03.987
[Derek] Whoa.

10:07.699 --> 10:09.322
I'm tired.

10:09.324 --> 10:11.366
Let's go back to my place.

10:11.368 --> 10:12.243
I can't.

10:12.245 --> 10:13.663
I'm with someone.

10:17.333 --> 10:18.293
Bring him.

10:22.296 --> 10:23.837
[Miles] Hey.

10:23.839 --> 10:25.340
Really Joan?

10:31.555 --> 10:34.016
(dance music)

11:49.175 --> 11:52.136
(doorbell buzzing)

11:54.555 --> 11:56.013
[Joan] Come on, let's go.

11:56.015 --> 11:57.056
Come on, let's go.

11:57.058 --> 11:58.265
Get the fuck out.

11:58.267 --> 11:59.893
[Neal] Hey hey hey,
right there's good.

12:01.396 --> 12:02.271
Frank.

12:03.564 --> 12:04.605
Sorry.

12:04.607 --> 12:05.482
Please, come in.

12:08.902 --> 12:09.820
Take care of them.

12:12.030 --> 12:14.698
Put your clothes on.

12:14.700 --> 12:17.745
Come on.
(finger snapping)

12:24.376 --> 12:25.960
I'll be in the car.

12:25.962 --> 12:27.255
Like anybody gives a shit.

12:28.464 --> 12:30.340
I see you've been
entertaining again.

12:31.468 --> 12:34.384
Got let off a little
steam now and again.

12:34.386 --> 12:36.555
Well, I'm sure you let
off plenty last night.

12:38.974 --> 12:40.307
You gotta be careful.

12:40.309 --> 12:42.352
You don't know what kind
of people are out there.

12:44.772 --> 12:46.480
I am those kind of people.

12:46.482 --> 12:47.357
Remember?

12:49.944 --> 12:51.193
[Frank] Jesus, Joan.

12:51.195 --> 12:52.153
You look like shit.

12:52.155 --> 12:53.655
When's the last time you slept?

12:55.407 --> 12:56.492
Couple of days maybe.

13:01.872 --> 13:03.831
I could go for some eggs.

13:03.833 --> 13:06.333
My bitch of a wife
has me on a diet

13:06.335 --> 13:09.544
and I need eggs and
bacon and more bacon.

13:09.546 --> 13:12.506
(drink pouring)

13:12.508 --> 13:14.385
You know bacon's
bad for your heart.

13:16.011 --> 13:18.012
[Frank] Don't you
worry about my heart.

13:18.014 --> 13:19.516
Too old to give a shit anyway.

13:22.227 --> 13:23.977
I have some
leftover taco salad.

13:26.522 --> 13:27.981
(fridge closing)

13:31.861 --> 13:33.154
You're not old, by the way.

13:36.491 --> 13:39.700
Seriously, if I
were a working stiff...

13:39.702 --> 13:40.701
[Joan] God forbid.

13:40.703 --> 13:42.245
No, if I were a working stiff,

13:42.247 --> 13:43.747
I'd be coming up on retirement.

13:45.250 --> 13:47.499
[Joan] People like
us, we don't retire.

13:47.501 --> 13:48.750
Yeah, well you
keep pulling stunts

13:48.752 --> 13:50.001
like the one you
pulled last night,

13:50.003 --> 13:51.547
you'll be lucky
to see retirement.

13:54.633 --> 13:55.551
Don't be silly.

13:59.389 --> 14:02.056
I'm serious as a
heart attack, Joanie.

14:02.058 --> 14:03.349
If you're not careful,
you're gonna wind up

14:03.351 --> 14:04.352
with a bullet in the
back of your head.

14:05.352 --> 14:06.059
(laughing)

14:06.061 --> 14:07.562
Don't worry about me.

14:07.564 --> 14:09.730
I'm faster and tougher
than any dickwad out there.

14:09.732 --> 14:11.316
[Frank] You're not
tougher than a bullet.

14:12.651 --> 14:14.818
He was disrespecting me.

14:14.820 --> 14:16.071
What was I supposed to do?

14:17.699 --> 14:19.322
Well, let's just say
your managerial skill

14:19.324 --> 14:21.535
leaves much to be desired.

14:26.540 --> 14:29.167
Frank,

14:29.169 --> 14:33.129
you know I would never do
anything to embarrass you.

14:33.131 --> 14:35.089
I've outlived a lot of cocky
youngsters, just like you,

14:35.091 --> 14:37.260
because I knew when
to keep my cool.

14:42.515 --> 14:43.847
Well, you keep
eating like that,

14:43.849 --> 14:46.100
I'm gonna outlive
you, no problem.

14:46.102 --> 14:47.769
Very fucking funny.

14:47.771 --> 14:49.646
Give me a napkin.

14:51.232 --> 14:53.068
Listen,

14:54.444 --> 14:57.736
my nephew, George, is
gonna be joining the crew.

14:57.738 --> 14:59.864
I want you to look out for him.

14:59.866 --> 15:00.949
And watch your temper.

15:02.160 --> 15:03.784
If you don't change your ways,

15:03.786 --> 15:05.912
you're gonna be looking
at an early retirement,

15:05.914 --> 15:07.165
if you know what I mean.

15:09.958 --> 15:11.752
Yeah, sorry, right.

15:13.253 --> 15:14.171
All right, good.

15:16.299 --> 15:17.923
Check in with Anson.

15:17.925 --> 15:18.926
He's got an important
job for you.

15:20.011 --> 15:22.552
Meanwhile, I gotta go
take care of the mess

15:22.554 --> 15:23.473
you made last night.

15:28.645 --> 15:31.314
(hip hop music)

15:49.707 --> 15:50.914
Oh.

15:50.916 --> 15:51.917
Can I help you?

15:53.837 --> 15:55.836
No, I don't think you can.

15:55.838 --> 15:56.839
Oh, just,

15:57.756 --> 15:59.133
where do you think you're going?

16:00.551 --> 16:01.967
Where do you think I'm going?

16:01.969 --> 16:02.802
Up there.

16:02.804 --> 16:04.054
Oh, okay.

16:05.140 --> 16:07.389
I'm afraid we haven't
been properly introduced.

16:07.391 --> 16:08.682
My name is George.

16:08.684 --> 16:09.935
I run things around here.

16:10.811 --> 16:13.021
(laughing)

16:15.190 --> 16:17.025
That's funny.

16:19.445 --> 16:21.571
Now get outta my face.

16:21.573 --> 16:22.406
Whoa.

16:24.199 --> 16:25.825
I don't think you understand.

16:25.827 --> 16:27.701
My uncle owns this company.

16:27.703 --> 16:29.997
And, by extension, me.

16:31.040 --> 16:33.916
You work for him, you
work for me, sweetheart.

16:33.918 --> 16:34.878
You got that?

16:37.338 --> 16:38.921
You don't run shit.

16:38.923 --> 16:40.214
You might be Frank's nephew,

16:40.216 --> 16:42.716
but you're just
another dumbass kid.

16:42.718 --> 16:45.510
So, get your head out of your
ass and get outta my face.

16:45.512 --> 16:46.680
Joan.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.722
What?

16:48.724 --> 16:50.932
You gonna let her
talk to me like this?

16:50.934 --> 16:52.102
Anson wants to see you.

17:03.073 --> 17:05.281
Be sure to wash and wax it.

17:08.953 --> 17:10.036
I see you met Joan.

17:10.038 --> 17:11.788
Yeah yeah yeah, she's feisty.

17:11.790 --> 17:13.122
I really like that.

17:13.124 --> 17:14.749
I'd stay out of her face.

17:14.751 --> 17:16.165
She bites.

17:16.167 --> 17:17.041
Yeah, me too.

17:17.044 --> 17:18.586
Hey do me a favor.

17:18.588 --> 17:19.836
Take this to the dry
cleaners, get the blood out,

17:19.838 --> 17:20.922
have 'em back to
me tomorrow, okay?

17:20.924 --> 17:22.507
Appreciate that.

17:22.509 --> 17:24.886
What the fuck is
going on around here?

17:26.512 --> 17:28.304
Who is this guy?

17:28.306 --> 17:29.931
You gotta put up with him.

17:29.933 --> 17:32.849
He's the boss-man's nephew.

17:32.851 --> 17:34.352
[Miles] Hey, George.

17:34.354 --> 17:35.228
It was just a joke, buddy.

17:35.230 --> 17:36.269
Hey, George, come back here.

17:36.271 --> 17:37.272
Yo.

17:41.319 --> 17:42.402
Doesn't match now.

17:42.404 --> 17:44.194
(speaks indistinctly)

17:44.196 --> 17:45.946
This doesn't make any sense.

17:45.948 --> 17:47.615
Hey, Joan.

17:47.617 --> 17:49.032
How's it going?

17:49.034 --> 17:49.991
Can't complain.

17:49.993 --> 17:53.328
(boots slamming)

17:53.330 --> 17:55.123
[Donna] Never-ending
paperwork.

17:55.125 --> 17:58.334
It's not easy being a
woman in a man's world.

17:58.336 --> 18:00.171
Ain't that the truth?

18:01.213 --> 18:02.381
Will you give us
some privacy, Donna?

18:03.465 --> 18:04.466
[Donna] Yes, sir.

18:11.014 --> 18:13.016
[Anson] And get
your feet off my desk.

18:17.312 --> 18:19.521
[Joan] And what can
I do for you today,

18:19.523 --> 18:22.316
oh great Mr. Anson, sir?

18:22.318 --> 18:23.942
Cut the crap.

18:23.944 --> 18:25.361
I got a dead employee.

18:25.363 --> 18:26.364
That's what's up.

18:27.490 --> 18:29.156
So?

18:29.158 --> 18:31.075
Can't you just do
the usual casserole?

18:31.077 --> 18:33.368
The usual casserole?

18:33.370 --> 18:34.872
What's that supposed to mean?

18:36.707 --> 18:38.834
What am I gonna tell
this kid's family, huh?

18:41.003 --> 18:43.171
You can tell them
that their star athlete

18:43.173 --> 18:45.008
tried to kill me
with a baseball bat.

18:46.259 --> 18:47.759
It was self-defense.

18:47.761 --> 18:51.261
Self-defense or not, don't
you ever do that again.

18:51.263 --> 18:53.015
You hear me?

18:53.767 --> 18:57.059
Look, man, you got a problem?

18:57.061 --> 18:58.646
Talk to Frank.

19:01.107 --> 19:02.856
You watch yourself.

19:02.858 --> 19:04.985
Frank can only do so much.

19:09.823 --> 19:11.867
Now, got something
for you to do.

19:13.036 --> 19:15.661
Frank has asked you to
personally take care of this.

19:15.663 --> 19:18.247
Some asshole with a conscience

19:18.249 --> 19:20.001
is causing trouble
for us downtown.

19:23.296 --> 19:24.211
I get it.

19:24.213 --> 19:25.962
A few punches, a
little bit of blood,

19:25.964 --> 19:28.385
and everyone gets the message.

19:32.430 --> 19:33.554
Anthony?

19:33.556 --> 19:36.682
Social worker at the
Downtown Youth Shelter.

19:36.684 --> 19:39.727
He got the bright idea to
step out of the shelter

19:39.729 --> 19:41.395
and onto the streets,

19:41.397 --> 19:43.732
trying to help these kids
clean their lives up.

19:45.068 --> 19:47.694
Well, it means a drop
in demand for us.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.570
You need to go and
send a message.

19:50.572 --> 19:53.907
(ominous atmospheric music)

19:53.909 --> 19:54.743
Are you deaf?

19:57.539 --> 19:58.373
No.

19:59.581 --> 20:01.332
No, I got this.

20:01.334 --> 20:04.126
I sent the boys out
on a different job.

20:04.128 --> 20:06.128
You'll handle this one yourself.

20:06.130 --> 20:07.005
Got it?

20:13.762 --> 20:16.765
Donna, get back in here.

20:20.895 --> 20:22.062
(sighing)

20:29.404 --> 20:33.742
(suspenseful
electronic rock music)

20:47.172 --> 20:49.841
(siren wailing)

21:16.533 --> 21:17.534
Shit.

21:18.078 --> 21:19.242
Hey, babe.

21:19.244 --> 21:20.537
Did you miss me?

21:22.331 --> 21:25.334
Sorry about last night.

21:43.395 --> 21:44.521
That's not why I'm here.

21:49.149 --> 21:50.691
You've been making some problems

21:50.693 --> 21:53.363
for some very important people.

21:54.489 --> 21:56.241
What are you talking about?

21:57.783 --> 22:00.742
You know what this is about.

22:00.744 --> 22:01.661
I'm sorry.

22:01.663 --> 22:02.664
I don't.

22:05.082 --> 22:06.959
These are our best customers.

22:08.461 --> 22:11.546
You get in the way
of our business,

22:11.548 --> 22:12.838
we'll get in the way of yours.

22:12.840 --> 22:14.508
Is this about
the youth shelter?

22:19.931 --> 22:21.766
You don't look so good.

22:23.518 --> 22:24.642
Why don't you calm down.

22:24.644 --> 22:26.102
Let's go get some fresh air.

22:26.104 --> 22:28.895
Why are you always trying
to shove me down, huh?

22:28.897 --> 22:30.357
I'm not a little girl anymore.

22:39.075 --> 22:40.285
Fuck.

22:40.909 --> 22:41.951
I can't do this.

22:41.953 --> 22:43.744
What's gotten into you?

22:43.746 --> 22:44.747
Are you on something?

22:45.540 --> 22:46.748
Get the hell outta here.

22:46.750 --> 22:48.249
Now.

22:48.251 --> 22:49.293
Go.

23:13.984 --> 23:17.696
(ominous atmospheric music)

23:46.184 --> 23:47.057
(doors closing)

23:47.059 --> 23:48.227
Hey, guys.

23:48.895 --> 23:49.896
What's up?

23:50.146 --> 23:50.936
I don't wanna go out to...

23:50.938 --> 23:51.813
(hard slapping)

23:51.815 --> 23:52.605
(grunting)

23:52.607 --> 23:53.605
(ominous guitar music)

23:53.607 --> 23:54.816
Shut your fucking mouth.

23:54.818 --> 23:55.732
[Joan] What the
fuck was that for?

23:55.734 --> 23:57.652
[Miles] I said
shut your mouth.

23:57.654 --> 23:58.861
(heavy punching)
(grunting)

23:58.863 --> 24:00.695
(laughing)

24:00.697 --> 24:01.530
[Miles] Oh, that's a good one.

24:01.532 --> 24:02.533
A little fight, huh?

24:02.826 --> 24:03.657
[Joan] Back up.

24:03.659 --> 24:05.117
Don't make me shoot you.

24:05.119 --> 24:05.992
(pipe clanging)
(grunting)

24:05.994 --> 24:06.868
(gun clattering)

24:06.870 --> 24:08.663
Oh, oh.

24:08.665 --> 24:09.999
[George] Whoo!

24:11.417 --> 24:13.375
See what happens to
your fucking gun, huh?

24:13.377 --> 24:14.919
[Miles] This is
what happens, huh?

24:14.921 --> 24:17.003
You know, Joan, I used to
think you were a hot chick.

24:17.005 --> 24:18.213
[Derek] Yeah.

24:18.215 --> 24:19.550
That was until
I got to know you,

24:21.176 --> 24:22.177
you know?

24:22.386 --> 24:24.178
You know, maybe if you
were like a team player,

24:24.180 --> 24:25.054
which you're not.

24:25.056 --> 24:25.846
[George] Yeah.

24:25.848 --> 24:27.097
We got your back

24:27.099 --> 24:28.641
and your always running
your fucking mouth.

24:28.643 --> 24:29.642
Where you going,
where you going?

24:29.644 --> 24:31.144
(screaming)

24:31.146 --> 24:32.436
Where you going?

24:32.438 --> 24:33.354
(gun firing)

24:33.356 --> 24:34.105
(screaming)

24:34.107 --> 24:35.021
Oh.

24:35.023 --> 24:35.772
[George] Yes!

24:35.774 --> 24:37.567
I fucking got her.

24:37.569 --> 24:38.483
(crying)

24:38.485 --> 24:41.153
Where you going?

24:41.155 --> 24:42.571
(door banging)

24:42.573 --> 24:43.741
No one's home, honey.

24:45.409 --> 24:46.701
Where you going, huh?

24:46.703 --> 24:47.826
Hey, don't kill her yet.

24:47.828 --> 24:48.827
Don't kill her yet.

24:48.829 --> 24:50.454
Let's have some fun, right?

24:50.456 --> 24:51.913
If she tries to
run, you shoot her.

24:51.915 --> 24:53.207
Okay, relax.

24:53.209 --> 24:55.084
- Don't fucking run.
- Come on, let's go, let's go.

24:55.086 --> 24:57.336
Oh!

24:57.338 --> 24:59.505
That lady got balls.

24:59.507 --> 25:00.383
Whoo!

25:01.717 --> 25:02.467
(knife slicing)

25:02.469 --> 25:03.384
Ah, fuck.

25:03.386 --> 25:04.134
What the fuck?

25:04.136 --> 25:05.053
(pipe hitting)

25:05.055 --> 25:06.389
Hey, where's your
fucking knife now?

25:07.973 --> 25:09.057
Yeah.

25:09.059 --> 25:10.892
You better not run, though.

25:10.894 --> 25:11.601
Let's just kill
her man, come on.

25:11.603 --> 25:12.643
Stop!

25:12.645 --> 25:13.810
Wait, what's Frank gonna think

25:13.812 --> 25:15.020
once Frank's heard about this?

25:15.022 --> 25:16.314
We're gonna tell him
that you got killed

25:16.316 --> 25:17.147
by a rival gang.

25:17.149 --> 25:18.982
It happens all the time.

25:18.984 --> 25:19.858
(laughing)

25:19.860 --> 25:21.402
- Fuck you.
- Oh.

25:21.404 --> 25:23.070
Fuck all of you.

25:23.072 --> 25:23.904
I won't forget this.

25:23.906 --> 25:25.114
What are you gonna do?

25:25.116 --> 25:26.656
You gonna scratch
out our eyes, huh,

25:26.658 --> 25:29.743
with your empty promises,
your empty threats, huh?

25:29.745 --> 25:31.953
Why couldn't you
just shut your mouth

25:31.955 --> 25:33.789
and take your cut?

25:33.791 --> 25:34.582
You know what?

25:34.584 --> 25:36.124
Shut your fucking mouth, okay?

25:36.126 --> 25:38.752
Because you would order
us around with your jokes

25:38.754 --> 25:40.837
and your empty threats, but
you know how to do your job?

25:40.839 --> 25:42.632
Me, not you, all right?

25:42.634 --> 25:45.343
Now, I do the job
and I get the glory.

25:45.345 --> 25:46.885
Yeah.

25:46.887 --> 25:49.346
Wait, stop stop, please.

25:49.348 --> 25:51.432
Please, I got money.

25:51.434 --> 25:54.354
I got about $30,000

25:55.646 --> 25:56.772
in a box under my bed.

25:57.857 --> 25:59.147
If you let me go,
it's all yours.

25:59.149 --> 26:00.107
We all got money.

26:00.109 --> 26:00.817
Yeah, we all got money.

26:00.819 --> 26:01.608
Just walk away.

26:01.610 --> 26:02.859
You know what?

26:02.861 --> 26:04.153
Let me shoot her, come on.

26:04.155 --> 26:05.238
I don't think I will,
but thanks for that tip.

26:05.240 --> 26:06.489
[Joan] Miles,
please don't do this.

26:06.491 --> 26:07.490
(pipe hitting)

26:07.492 --> 26:08.156
Oh!
(rock music)

26:08.158 --> 26:09.241
Fucking bitch.

26:09.243 --> 26:10.785
You gonna help me with this?

26:10.787 --> 26:11.868
Goddamn, yes.

26:11.870 --> 26:13.078
(pipe hitting)

26:13.080 --> 26:14.538
(kicking)

26:14.540 --> 26:17.124
(grunting)

26:17.126 --> 26:18.127
Fucking bitch.

26:25.635 --> 26:27.634
All right, Miles,
Miles, enough, man.

26:27.636 --> 26:28.803
Come on, let's get
the fuck outta here.

26:28.805 --> 26:29.846
Yeah, she thought
she was better than us.

26:29.848 --> 26:31.847
Fucking bitch is (indistinct).

26:31.849 --> 26:34.142
(spitting)

26:34.144 --> 26:34.976
Whoo!

26:34.978 --> 26:36.477
I gotta start doing more cardio.

26:36.479 --> 26:37.396
(laughing)

26:38.188 --> 26:39.148
Fucking feel alive.

26:42.609 --> 26:43.610
Whoo!

26:46.239 --> 26:47.989
[George] Let's go, bitch tits.

26:47.991 --> 26:49.158
- Come on.
- Let's go.

26:55.498 --> 26:58.668
[Man] I haven't
shot up for weeks.

27:01.671 --> 27:02.920
What about your dad?

27:02.922 --> 27:03.962
Did you speak to him?

27:03.964 --> 27:05.173
Fuck that asshole.

27:05.175 --> 27:08.009
Always going on and on
about the old country

27:08.011 --> 27:11.095
and how he used to be and
he wasn't even born there.

27:11.097 --> 27:13.013
Well, but he is your father.

27:13.015 --> 27:15.098
[Man] No, not
according to him.

27:15.100 --> 27:17.184
Ah, you shouldn't
take personally

27:17.186 --> 27:20.771
things that are said in the
heat of the moment, right?

27:20.773 --> 27:22.357
(door knocking)

27:23.358 --> 27:25.403
Anthony, can I talk
to you for a moment?

27:27.321 --> 27:29.113
Um, sure.

27:29.115 --> 27:31.201
Guys, would you excuse
me for a moment?

27:42.212 --> 27:43.588
Cheryl, what's wrong?

27:44.880 --> 27:47.798
Do you remember that girl
you used to date, Joan?

27:47.800 --> 27:49.549
I just saw her yesterday.

27:49.551 --> 27:50.759
Why?

27:50.761 --> 27:52.886
You wanna tell me
what's really going on?

27:52.888 --> 27:53.721
What do you mean?

27:53.723 --> 27:55.056
She came here the other day,

27:55.058 --> 27:56.059
was looking for you.

27:57.894 --> 27:58.643
It's fine.

27:58.645 --> 27:59.894
Don't worry about it.

27:59.896 --> 28:02.980
It's really nothing for
you to get upset about.

28:02.982 --> 28:04.981
I don't want her
hanging around here.

28:04.983 --> 28:06.442
I don't like her.

28:06.444 --> 28:07.984
I know all about the
people she hangs out with,

28:07.986 --> 28:10.028
all about the things she does.

28:10.030 --> 28:11.405
I don't want her
around this house.

28:11.407 --> 28:13.281
This is a safe zone.

28:13.283 --> 28:15.992
So, next time you see
her, tell her to stay away

28:15.994 --> 28:17.619
or I will.

28:17.621 --> 28:19.454
Yes, ma'am.

28:19.456 --> 28:20.914
Good.

28:20.916 --> 28:22.167
Now get back to work.

28:26.755 --> 28:27.923
(door closing)

28:33.722 --> 28:36.808
(ominous synth music)

28:46.859 --> 28:53.657
(wind rushing)
(crunching and squishing)

29:01.290 --> 29:04.461
(ominous guitar music)

29:06.044 --> 29:08.005
(growl)

29:30.444 --> 29:33.030
(wind rushing)

29:43.249 --> 29:46.211
(liquid squishing)

29:54.844 --> 29:57.514
(wind rushing)

30:07.690 --> 30:09.231
Who's there?

30:09.233 --> 30:11.858
(heavy breathing)

30:11.860 --> 30:13.111
What, what's wrong?

30:13.113 --> 30:14.778
[Woman] Well, I
thought I saw something.

30:14.780 --> 30:15.821
Aw, you're dreaming.

30:15.823 --> 30:17.615
Go back to sleep, honey.

30:17.617 --> 30:19.077
I saw something.

30:22.371 --> 30:23.538
(wind rushing)

30:23.540 --> 30:25.038
Hey, get out of here.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.207
Sorry.

30:26.209 --> 30:29.376
[Woman] What are you doing?

30:29.378 --> 30:30.795
What was that?

30:30.797 --> 30:32.505
[Woman] There was a
strange woman in the corner.

30:32.507 --> 30:33.338
Come on.

30:33.340 --> 30:38.053
(yelling)
(wind rushing)

30:40.932 --> 30:42.765
(grunting)

30:42.767 --> 30:44.352
Joan, what are you doing here?

30:46.271 --> 30:47.813
Leave the light off, please.

30:53.569 --> 30:54.736
Can't keep doing this.

30:54.738 --> 30:56.028
You have to let it go.

30:56.030 --> 30:57.531
Now you're breaking
into my place.

31:00.284 --> 31:03.411
You know those guys I
used to hang out with?

31:03.413 --> 31:04.746
Of course.

31:04.748 --> 31:06.458
They're the bane
of my existence.

31:07.959 --> 31:12.464
I'm gonna get them and
I need you to help me.

31:14.549 --> 31:16.339
What am I gonna do?

31:16.341 --> 31:18.261
You're the only
one that I can trust.

31:20.930 --> 31:23.099
I need to make them pay
for what they've done.

31:24.517 --> 31:25.477
[Anthony] What have they done?

31:31.066 --> 31:34.110
They jumped me
outside of my apartment.

31:35.278 --> 31:36.193
Oh my god.

31:36.195 --> 31:37.069
Are you okay?

31:37.071 --> 31:38.320
Let me take you to a hospital,

31:38.322 --> 31:39.948
let the cops take care of this.

31:41.117 --> 31:42.284
The cops?

31:43.536 --> 31:44.788
What are they gonna do?

31:45.621 --> 31:47.038
I'll take you to a hospital,

31:47.040 --> 31:49.792
but I'm not gonna help you
with some ridiculous vendetta.

31:52.462 --> 31:53.463
Very well.

31:54.463 --> 31:57.050
You won't join me, then
I'll do it on my own.

31:58.635 --> 32:01.304
(wind rushing)

32:03.138 --> 32:08.144
You're going to see what a
woman's wrath looks like.

32:10.646 --> 32:14.731
(ominous atmospheric music)

32:14.733 --> 32:16.026
Joan, you need to stop this.

32:25.744 --> 32:27.494
I have to
congratulate you, Miles.

32:27.496 --> 32:30.248
Revenues been up since
you took over the crew.

32:30.250 --> 32:31.835
Up by 12.5%.

32:33.252 --> 32:35.169
That's what happens when
you put a man in charge.

32:35.171 --> 32:37.215
[Derek] Yeah, makin'
a real killin' now.

32:38.340 --> 32:39.339
What's that supposed to mean?

32:39.341 --> 32:40.508
Cool your jets, asshole.

32:40.510 --> 32:42.509
You got something
you wanna fuckin' say?

32:42.511 --> 32:43.176
Relax, dude.

32:43.178 --> 32:44.470
It's a joke, okay?

32:44.472 --> 32:45.387
It's nothing.

32:45.389 --> 32:48.057
Hey, we all know
whose dick is bigger.

32:48.059 --> 32:49.767
Let's get our work done.

32:49.769 --> 32:51.018
That's right, bitch tits.

32:51.020 --> 32:54.020
Get out there and do
your fucking jobs.

32:54.022 --> 32:55.942
Listen man, keep your
fucking mouth shut.

33:01.030 --> 33:02.195
Anthony.

33:02.197 --> 33:03.198
Anthony, it's me.

33:04.032 --> 33:05.117
You're following me now?

33:06.368 --> 33:08.243
Hey, did I come
over last night?

33:08.245 --> 33:10.706
Do you remember me coming by?

33:13.501 --> 33:15.209
What?

33:15.211 --> 33:18.213
Look, something
strange is happening.

33:22.049 --> 33:25.135
Listen, you need to stay
away from me, all right?

33:25.137 --> 33:26.386
Don't talk to me.

33:26.388 --> 33:28.388
I can't deal with this.

33:28.390 --> 33:29.725
Just go away.

33:35.940 --> 33:37.442
Oh, and one more thing.

33:47.952 --> 33:51.328
(wind rushing)

33:51.330 --> 33:52.706
I need to talk to you.

33:54.501 --> 33:55.333
I can't.

33:55.335 --> 33:57.042
I don't wanna get involved.

33:57.044 --> 33:59.336
You're the only
person I can turn to.

33:59.338 --> 34:00.253
Really?

34:00.255 --> 34:01.756
Don't you have anyone else,

34:01.758 --> 34:02.759
your friends?

34:03.760 --> 34:06.346
My friends took a
crowbar to my skull.

34:09.931 --> 34:11.598
I'm sorry, I can't.

34:11.600 --> 34:14.976
(woman screaming)

34:14.978 --> 34:15.851
Let me go.

34:15.853 --> 34:17.103
I'm not doing anything.

34:17.106 --> 34:19.857
Hey, you wanna work my
streets, you gotta pay the rent.

34:19.859 --> 34:21.109
(laughing)

34:21.110 --> 34:22.109
Stop wriggling
around, you bitch.

34:22.110 --> 34:23.777
Let me go.

34:23.780 --> 34:24.821
(hard smacking)

34:24.822 --> 34:26.071
Now shut your fucking mouth.

34:26.072 --> 34:27.114
You talk when I
tell you to talk.

34:27.117 --> 34:28.447
[Anthony] Rose?

34:28.449 --> 34:29.283
Hey, this ain't none
of your concern, retard.

34:29.284 --> 34:30.158
Who the fuck are you?

34:30.159 --> 34:31.451
I'm not talking to you.

34:31.453 --> 34:33.036
You wanna make
this your business?

34:33.039 --> 34:33.870
It's my job.

34:33.871 --> 34:35.371
Oh, are you a cop?

34:35.373 --> 34:37.040
He's my youth counselor.

34:37.042 --> 34:38.125
Oh shit.

34:38.127 --> 34:39.627
You're a counselor.

34:39.629 --> 34:41.087
Well, mister counselor, one
of your little charges here

34:41.089 --> 34:42.670
has been working my
streets without a permit.

34:42.672 --> 34:43.630
Very big no no.

34:43.632 --> 34:44.549
Bad little girl.

34:44.551 --> 34:45.299
(spitting)

34:45.301 --> 34:46.216
Bad girl.

34:46.217 --> 34:47.092
Let her go.

34:47.094 --> 34:48.386
She's just a teenager.

34:48.388 --> 34:49.511
Oh, she feels more
like a woman to me.

34:49.513 --> 34:50.469
We got a teenager.

34:50.472 --> 34:52.889
(laughing)

34:52.891 --> 34:53.808
You get the fuck back.

34:53.810 --> 34:54.808
(hard punching)

34:54.810 --> 34:55.600
You got knocked the fuck out.

34:55.601 --> 34:57.854
That what happens, you fuck.

34:57.856 --> 34:58.812
Now, listen here, buddy.

34:58.814 --> 34:59.980
I got no beef with you,

34:59.982 --> 35:01.649
but you keep messin' with us,

35:01.651 --> 35:02.691
you're gonna end
up six feet under.

35:02.693 --> 35:04.819
Kick his fucking ass, Miles.

35:04.821 --> 35:05.822
[Rose] Stop it.

35:06.656 --> 35:07.654
You understand okay?
(wind rushing)

35:07.656 --> 35:08.823
Get your hands off him.

35:08.825 --> 35:10.073
(heavy punching)
(grunting)

35:10.075 --> 35:11.158
What the fuck?

35:11.160 --> 35:11.908
Where did you come from?

35:11.910 --> 35:12.828
Get her outta here.

35:13.830 --> 35:14.831
What the fuck
are you doing here?

35:16.665 --> 35:17.165
It doesn't matter.

35:17.167 --> 35:18.374
You know what?

35:18.376 --> 35:20.250
I'm in charge now. We don't
pussyfoot around anymore.

35:20.252 --> 35:21.169
(grunting)

35:21.171 --> 35:23.921
(ominous guitar music)

35:23.923 --> 35:26.674
You always were
easily distracted.

35:26.676 --> 35:27.969
Motherfucker!

35:29.136 --> 35:31.472
(grunting)

35:35.267 --> 35:37.517
You're gonna have to
try harder than that.

35:37.519 --> 35:38.685
We don't fuck
around here anymore.

35:38.687 --> 35:40.231
Time to bring this bitch down.

35:41.274 --> 35:42.607
(wind rushing)

35:42.609 --> 35:44.734
(grunting)

35:44.736 --> 35:45.651
Miles, let's get
outta here, man.

35:45.653 --> 35:46.863
This shit ain't right.

35:50.533 --> 35:53.658
(heavy breathing)
(wind rushing)

35:53.660 --> 35:55.370
What was that?

35:59.042 --> 36:00.919
We need to get outta here.

36:10.386 --> 36:11.930
Take her back to the shelter.

36:13.097 --> 36:13.888
I'll be all right.

36:13.890 --> 36:15.100
I'm not leaving you here.

36:18.144 --> 36:21.022
I know a place
where it's safe.

36:32.200 --> 36:35.245
(door sliding open)

36:43.669 --> 36:45.336
I used to come here when
my parents would fight.

36:45.338 --> 36:47.546
(door sliding closed)

36:47.548 --> 36:48.423
(grunting)

36:48.425 --> 36:50.593
Back before I
was at the shelter.

36:59.977 --> 37:02.062
(sighing)

37:03.356 --> 37:04.607
God.

37:06.693 --> 37:09.278
(lock clicking)

37:10.488 --> 37:11.448
[Anthony] You all right?

37:13.615 --> 37:15.534
I don't think so.

37:19.497 --> 37:22.709
How did you, um, do that

37:24.127 --> 37:25.837
thing with the shadows?

37:27.546 --> 37:29.048
Just seems like
it was a part of me.

37:31.341 --> 37:32.551
It was pretty fucking cool.

37:35.388 --> 37:38.013
Did they hurt
you or violate you?

37:38.015 --> 37:39.017
Did they?

37:39.934 --> 37:41.350
No.

37:41.352 --> 37:43.185
Those guys wouldn't know
their dicks from a rubber hose.

37:43.187 --> 37:45.354
You sure got a mouth on you.

37:45.356 --> 37:46.566
Ain't that the truth.

37:51.278 --> 37:53.572
Well, I need to get going.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.283
Got prior engagements?

37:57.160 --> 37:58.161
I gotta clean up.

38:02.122 --> 38:03.205
(scoffing)

38:03.207 --> 38:04.209
What?

38:05.251 --> 38:06.252
Just go.

38:08.088 --> 38:09.504
Are you sure you're okay?

38:09.506 --> 38:12.506
You want me to take you
back to the shelter?

38:12.508 --> 38:15.010
No, I'd rather stay here.

38:16.095 --> 38:19.223
You sure you're safe with her?

38:20.557 --> 38:21.517
I'm not gonna hurt her.

38:24.187 --> 38:26.856
Well, don't let anyone
else get in here, all right?

38:30.193 --> 38:33.238
(door sliding open)

38:41.578 --> 38:44.037
(door sliding closed)

38:44.039 --> 38:46.999
(lock clicking)

38:47.001 --> 38:48.877
What do you see in him?

38:50.713 --> 38:54.756
He's cute in a
dorky kind of way.

38:54.758 --> 38:57.094
Besides, girls like me
can't afford to be picky.

39:01.807 --> 39:03.059
[Rose] What happened to you?

39:04.352 --> 39:05.395
I heard that you got attacked.

39:08.481 --> 39:10.480
I don't like to
think about it.

39:10.482 --> 39:11.901
[Rose] Oh, but
what was it like?

39:19.075 --> 39:20.073
I don't know.

39:20.075 --> 39:21.827
I don't remember everything.

39:24.037 --> 39:27.165
There was a sharp
pain in my head

39:27.167 --> 39:31.629
and suddenly my
whole body went numb

39:33.964 --> 39:35.966
and next thing I know,
I woke up in some alley.

39:37.551 --> 39:39.762
It was like you came
back from the dead.

39:43.098 --> 39:45.433
God.

39:45.435 --> 39:47.604
I wonder what it's
like to be dead.

39:50.272 --> 39:51.441
You know, it must
be kind of peaceful.

39:52.941 --> 39:53.943
Peaceful?

39:55.444 --> 39:56.861
It's not peaceful.

39:56.863 --> 39:58.615
It's painful.

40:02.535 --> 40:04.662
There's something that happened,

40:06.622 --> 40:08.624
something I can't explain.

40:09.792 --> 40:10.794
Just,

40:12.796 --> 40:14.254
just blackness.

40:23.932 --> 40:27.058
Besides, what are you doing,

40:27.060 --> 40:28.642
disrespecting your
body like that

40:28.644 --> 40:30.312
just to make a
little bit of money?

40:31.981 --> 40:33.272
You should be getting
ready for prom,

40:33.274 --> 40:35.443
not sleeping in some
filthy warehouse.

40:36.361 --> 40:37.237
It's a long story.

40:38.446 --> 40:39.572
You don't wanna hear it.

40:40.865 --> 40:42.492
I got all the
time in the world.

40:44.535 --> 40:46.120
I guess I could tell you.

40:48.289 --> 40:49.287
I don't know.

40:49.289 --> 40:51.083
I guess it all started
back in middle school.

40:57.006 --> 40:58.383
There was one year at camp,

41:03.178 --> 41:05.932
all the girls used to sneak
into the boy's cabins at night.

41:08.184 --> 41:09.015
(dreamy atmospheric music)

41:09.017 --> 41:12.271
The usual teenager horny shit.

41:15.024 --> 41:18.191
Anyway, one night we were
hanging out and chatting

41:18.193 --> 41:22.614
and some people
started making out.

41:24.367 --> 41:27.035
And this big kid, Mario,

41:28.705 --> 41:30.039
he was probably a
football player,

41:32.207 --> 41:33.959
he comes over and
starts kissing me.

41:37.504 --> 41:38.921
And at first I
went along with it,

41:38.923 --> 41:41.383
'cause I liked the attention.

41:44.803 --> 41:46.136
Then he started to
get a little rough

41:46.138 --> 41:48.182
and I told him to
stop and he wouldn't.

41:53.604 --> 41:55.647
And his friends just
kept cheering him on.

42:05.492 --> 42:07.577
I just laid there and
let him do his thing.

42:09.787 --> 42:11.705
I laid there numb.

42:15.126 --> 42:16.919
My mind went elsewhere.

42:20.423 --> 42:22.883
But after that I could feel it,

42:25.260 --> 42:28.763
all of them laughing at
me and calling me a slut

42:28.765 --> 42:30.183
and a whore.

42:34.144 --> 42:35.062
Wow.

42:36.939 --> 42:38.148
Tell me about it.

42:42.194 --> 42:44.113
Now I'm telling you all this.

42:48.118 --> 42:50.453
How did you wind up
sleeping with men for money?

42:51.787 --> 42:55.624
I tried to get a
job, really I did,

42:57.419 --> 43:01.839
but who's gonna hire a
16-year-old homeless kid?

43:07.595 --> 43:08.471
Sorry.

43:12.015 --> 43:13.600
I know what it feels like.

43:14.477 --> 43:16.020
It gets better.

43:17.062 --> 43:18.231
It does.

43:19.314 --> 43:22.318
I left home when I was 17
years old and I made it.

43:23.653 --> 43:24.736
Look at me.

43:24.738 --> 43:26.114
You?

43:29.825 --> 43:31.785
And have my friends
leave me for dead.

43:33.912 --> 43:35.412
No thanks.

43:35.414 --> 43:37.249
Well, there's gotta
be a better way.

43:39.377 --> 43:40.712
I don't know.

43:43.173 --> 43:44.256
I'm just tired.

43:55.100 --> 43:56.102
Thank you

43:57.771 --> 43:58.729
for helping me out.

44:01.691 --> 44:04.026
And I do hope that you
get this all figured out.

44:05.444 --> 44:06.403
You're welcome.

44:07.696 --> 44:08.655
[Rose] Goodnight.

44:09.865 --> 44:10.867
Night.

44:19.542 --> 44:22.212
(wind rushing)

44:33.932 --> 44:36.559
(wind rushing)

44:45.484 --> 44:48.988
(ominous orchestral music)

44:54.910 --> 44:55.912
Hey.

44:56.955 --> 44:57.956
Hi.

45:02.252 --> 45:03.753
Well, I made it home safely,

45:04.504 --> 45:05.463
as you can see.

45:13.095 --> 45:13.929
I'm scared.

45:15.180 --> 45:18.515
What's going on?

45:18.517 --> 45:19.519
I don't know.

45:20.644 --> 45:22.271
I wish I did.

45:28.403 --> 45:32.321
Is this it for me,
hanging out in alleyways

45:32.323 --> 45:36.118
and warehouses with
the scum of humanity?

45:37.578 --> 45:38.953
(dramatic orchestral music)

45:38.955 --> 45:40.081
They're good kids.

45:42.959 --> 45:44.836
Rose seems okay.

45:48.964 --> 45:51.341
What if you had a chance
to make things better?

45:52.885 --> 45:55.095
What if this is what
you were meant to do?

45:57.473 --> 45:58.892
That's depressing.

46:00.392 --> 46:03.727
Maybe you were
meant to protect them.

46:03.729 --> 46:05.147
From what?

46:05.856 --> 46:07.397
I can't even protect myself.

46:07.399 --> 46:10.651
Wouldn't you have wanted
someone to help you out?

46:10.653 --> 46:12.819
It doesn't work like that.

46:12.821 --> 46:13.698
Well, maybe it does.

46:17.660 --> 46:19.578
I like your optimism.

46:20.997 --> 46:21.955
Think about it.

46:23.082 --> 46:25.167
What if you could make
a difference here?

46:30.589 --> 46:31.591
Oh.

46:46.814 --> 46:48.439
Thank you, dear.

46:48.441 --> 46:49.943
Of course, Frank.

46:52.361 --> 46:54.780
Miles, tell him
what you told me.

46:56.950 --> 46:58.698
It was her, I swear to God.

46:58.700 --> 47:00.033
[Frank] Who?

47:00.035 --> 47:01.787
It was that fucking
barracuda, Joan.

47:03.580 --> 47:05.957
(sighing)

47:05.959 --> 47:08.002
[Frank] I am not happy.

47:08.877 --> 47:10.629
You were supposed
to finish her off.

47:13.048 --> 47:14.298
I could've sworn that we did.

47:14.300 --> 47:15.633
Don't worry, Frank.

47:15.635 --> 47:17.384
We'll take care of
this little problem.

47:17.386 --> 47:18.430
I hope that you do.

47:20.557 --> 47:25.392
You wouldn't want to
disappoint me again, would you?

47:25.394 --> 47:26.935
[Miles] No, Frank, I wouldn't.

47:26.937 --> 47:29.106
Good, get out.

47:30.399 --> 47:32.774
Dirk, stay behind.

47:32.776 --> 47:33.694
We need to talk.

47:36.573 --> 47:37.904
I'm sorry we let you down.

47:37.906 --> 47:40.283
Do we trust these
guys to do the job.

47:40.285 --> 47:41.743
Oh, absolutely.

47:41.745 --> 47:42.493
They're my best men.

47:42.495 --> 47:43.663
(hard slap)

47:45.080 --> 47:46.165
I'm sorry I failed you.

47:47.207 --> 47:50.586
All these years, you
never have until now.

47:52.213 --> 47:53.421
(ominous atmospheric music)

47:53.423 --> 47:54.171
Wait.

47:54.173 --> 47:56.592
Look, you, come on.

47:57.426 --> 47:58.426
It's not gonna happen again.

47:58.428 --> 48:00.011
I'm never gonna fail you again.

48:00.013 --> 48:02.138
[Frank] I know that you won't.

48:02.140 --> 48:02.888
(gun firing)

48:02.890 --> 48:04.600
(body thudding)

48:06.769 --> 48:08.685
What the...

48:08.687 --> 48:10.687
Miles, you're in charge now.

48:10.689 --> 48:12.439
Take care of the situation.

48:12.441 --> 48:13.443
[Miles] All right.

48:16.528 --> 48:17.446
Leave it.

48:20.283 --> 48:21.284
Donna.

48:25.120 --> 48:27.455
(gasping)

48:27.457 --> 48:28.458
You work for me now.

48:29.459 --> 48:30.376
You understand?

48:32.294 --> 48:33.586
Good.

48:33.588 --> 48:37.173
Now, get a clean-up
crew in here.

48:37.175 --> 48:40.053
I'm afraid that Dirk
has made a mess.

48:48.769 --> 48:50.477
All right, bitches,
things are gonna change.

48:50.479 --> 48:51.979
I'm in charge now.

48:51.981 --> 48:54.064
Hey, you notice anything
strange going on around here?

48:54.066 --> 48:55.524
No, we all knew this
day was coming, guys.

48:55.526 --> 48:57.026
What the hell?

48:57.028 --> 48:58.569
No no no, I'm talking about
Frank is acting differently.

48:58.571 --> 49:00.488
Eh, Frank just
needs to get laid.

49:00.490 --> 49:02.823
What the fuck are we gonna
do about this feisty bitch?

49:02.825 --> 49:04.618
[Miles] I don't know.

49:07.372 --> 49:09.707
(dog barking)

49:16.839 --> 49:18.173
Hey, working?

49:19.175 --> 49:20.343
Fuck off.

49:24.347 --> 49:29.352
(door alarm ringing)
(grunting)

49:30.769 --> 49:34.356
(ominous atmospheric music)

49:36.316 --> 49:39.109
(wind rushing)
(tires screeching)

49:39.111 --> 49:40.278
[Man] What the fuck?

49:40.280 --> 49:41.111
Nice ride.

49:41.113 --> 49:42.321
Where you taking it?

49:42.323 --> 49:43.781
(door alarm ringing)

49:43.783 --> 49:45.241
(ominous guitar music)

49:45.243 --> 49:46.366
Uh, what?

49:46.368 --> 49:47.618
No no no, slow down.

49:47.620 --> 49:48.785
What the fuck are
you talking about?

49:48.787 --> 49:50.203
Goddamn it.

49:50.205 --> 49:54.792
(heavy kicking)
(grunting)

49:54.794 --> 49:56.294
You.

49:56.296 --> 49:58.964
(wind rushing)

50:01.216 --> 50:02.174
You too.

50:02.176 --> 50:03.718
God, you motherfuckers.

50:03.720 --> 50:04.843
This is what we're
gonna do, okay?

50:04.845 --> 50:06.178
You get back there now.

50:06.180 --> 50:08.973
No, I don't give
a fuck, all right?

50:08.975 --> 50:10.433
Are you telling me what?

50:10.435 --> 50:12.562
I'm gonna knock your fucking
teeth in when I see you.

50:15.899 --> 50:17.899
(screaming)

50:17.901 --> 50:19.232
(muffled whimpering)

50:19.234 --> 50:21.486
Shut the fuck up.

50:21.488 --> 50:26.493
(wind rushing)
(grunting)

50:27.743 --> 50:29.160
Your job is very
fucking simple.

50:29.162 --> 50:30.453
You get in there you get...

50:30.455 --> 50:31.912
What the fuck you talking about?

50:31.914 --> 50:34.247
It's a girl!
It's a fucking girl, okay?

50:34.249 --> 50:35.792
She's got high-heels on.

50:35.794 --> 50:37.584
I don't fucking know, all right?

50:37.586 --> 50:43.091
(heavy kicking)
(grunting)

50:43.093 --> 50:45.511
(wind rushing)

50:49.682 --> 50:52.308
(cigar puffing)

50:52.310 --> 50:54.062
She still has such a nice ass.

50:54.812 --> 50:55.937
What the fuck, though?

50:55.939 --> 50:58.607
She got, like, shadows and shit.

51:03.946 --> 51:05.821
(coughing)

51:05.823 --> 51:06.782
How did she do that?

51:08.410 --> 51:11.118
Maybe she's a fucking ninja.

51:11.120 --> 51:13.247
(laughing)

51:26.553 --> 51:28.346
I know how we're
gonna get this bitch.

51:29.597 --> 51:32.098
(gas pouring)

51:32.100 --> 51:34.810
(lighter flicking)

51:38.481 --> 51:40.066
Light it up, boys.

51:41.984 --> 51:43.401
[George] Light it
up, man, we're ready.

51:43.403 --> 51:45.026
Like moths to a flame.

51:45.028 --> 51:47.573
(phone buzzing)

51:50.827 --> 51:52.868
Cheryl, why are you
calling me so late?

51:52.870 --> 51:54.078
[Cheryl] There's a
fire at the shelter

51:54.080 --> 51:55.662
and we can't find Dimitri.

51:55.664 --> 51:56.957
I'll be right there.

52:03.173 --> 52:05.925
(sirens wailing)

52:09.511 --> 52:10.761
(fire roaring)

52:10.763 --> 52:11.763
(suspenseful orchestral music)

52:11.765 --> 52:13.680
Dimitri!

52:13.682 --> 52:15.893
(coughing)

52:22.357 --> 52:23.359
Dimitri.

52:24.778 --> 52:25.817
Dimitri, wake up.

52:25.819 --> 52:27.611
Wake up.

52:27.613 --> 52:29.863
(coughing)

52:29.865 --> 52:30.948
(fire roaring)

52:30.950 --> 52:32.077
God.

52:35.955 --> 52:39.247
(sirens wailing)

52:39.249 --> 52:41.668
(wind rushing)

52:44.171 --> 52:45.546
(dramatic atmospheric music)

52:45.548 --> 52:48.716
You know, I am trying
to stay positive.

52:48.718 --> 52:50.470
I'm trying to be here for them.

52:51.345 --> 52:53.388
You, you just wanna
go after them.

52:53.390 --> 52:54.388
You just wanna kill them.

52:54.390 --> 52:55.555
You just wanna be like them.

52:55.557 --> 52:57.017
You just wanna do all that.

52:58.727 --> 53:01.647
It is not an answer.

53:02.356 --> 53:04.316
Violence only begets violence.

53:05.234 --> 53:07.151
This ends tonight.

53:07.153 --> 53:08.238
A kid is dead.

53:09.321 --> 53:10.240
You understand that?

53:13.993 --> 53:17.122
You don't, do you?

53:21.376 --> 53:22.252
Fine.

53:23.586 --> 53:25.086
Go.

53:25.088 --> 53:27.087
Go, do what you wanna do.

53:27.089 --> 53:28.091
I'm done.

53:32.511 --> 53:34.597
(humming)

53:54.283 --> 53:55.073
(burping)

53:55.075 --> 53:56.533
(TV powering on)

53:56.535 --> 53:57.453
Yeah.

53:58.537 --> 54:01.248
Mmm, ma ma ma ma.

54:04.961 --> 54:08.421
(light crackling and popping)

54:08.423 --> 54:10.008
What the fuck?

54:13.428 --> 54:15.930
I paid my fucking bill.

54:17.557 --> 54:21.017
(bulb squeaking)

54:21.019 --> 54:23.812
(switch flicking)

54:24.897 --> 54:26.316
Fucking bullshit.

54:27.149 --> 54:28.276
Hello?

54:33.156 --> 54:35.698
(wind rushing)

54:35.700 --> 54:36.823
(gun firing)

54:36.825 --> 54:38.116
(screaming)

54:38.118 --> 54:40.160
What the fuck?

54:40.162 --> 54:42.330
(wind rushing)

54:42.332 --> 54:43.413
(ominous atmospheric music)

54:43.415 --> 54:45.165
Ah, you fucking bitch.

54:45.167 --> 54:46.667
What the fuck are
you doing here?

54:46.669 --> 54:48.919
You want money, huh?

54:48.921 --> 54:49.879
Fucking take it.

54:49.881 --> 54:51.174
It's under the fucking...

54:52.091 --> 54:53.718
Ah, fuck.

54:54.426 --> 54:55.428
Fuck.

54:56.095 --> 54:57.472
Don't, don't.

54:58.640 --> 55:03.353
(wind rushing)
(choking)

55:10.693 --> 55:13.363
You thought I was
dead, didn't you?

55:16.115 --> 55:18.534
(wind rushing)

55:25.874 --> 55:27.918
(choking)

55:44.017 --> 55:45.269
Good riddance.

55:53.403 --> 55:54.319
Ah.

55:59.408 --> 56:01.952
(phone buzzing)

56:03.245 --> 56:04.370
Yeah?

56:04.372 --> 56:06.330
Whoa, slow down, what?

56:06.332 --> 56:07.790
What?

56:07.792 --> 56:09.459
No, you stay right there.
Fuck!

56:09.461 --> 56:11.588
Neal, get in here.

56:12.921 --> 56:13.923
Ah.

56:15.050 --> 56:16.339
Yeah?

56:16.341 --> 56:18.091
I need you to get Henry.

56:18.093 --> 56:19.511
You guys are gonna go do something
for me right now, okay?

56:30.647 --> 56:32.191
Normally I don't say anything.

56:33.776 --> 56:35.151
And I know you're
thinking you're doing

56:35.153 --> 56:36.444
what you gotta do, right?

56:36.446 --> 56:37.280
But...

56:41.117 --> 56:42.452
you gotta be careful.

56:45.205 --> 56:46.453
None of this is worth going out

56:46.455 --> 56:47.957
and getting yourself
killed over.

56:50.126 --> 56:51.792
That's very insightful of you.

56:51.794 --> 56:53.544
You know, I'm truly touched

56:53.546 --> 56:55.962
that you're concerned
about me like that,

56:55.964 --> 56:57.298
but I tell you what,

56:57.300 --> 56:59.341
if you like, you can come by my
house later, tuck me into bed,

56:59.343 --> 57:02.220
maybe give me a little
inner-thigh massage,

57:02.222 --> 57:03.136
but you worry 'bout you.

57:03.138 --> 57:04.805
You don't tell me what to do

57:04.807 --> 57:09.310
and you don't ever, ever
warn me like that, okay?

57:09.312 --> 57:10.313
I understand.

57:11.772 --> 57:12.649
You do you.

57:16.403 --> 57:19.486
(door opening)

57:19.488 --> 57:21.823
(door closing)

57:21.825 --> 57:25.118
(light piano music)

57:25.120 --> 57:28.039
[Cheryl] Right
over here, honey, please.

57:29.665 --> 57:31.832
Did you need a ride or...

57:31.834 --> 57:32.750
Uh-uh.

57:32.752 --> 57:33.878
I think I'd rather walk.

57:34.671 --> 57:36.044
Okay, we'll be
back at the place

57:36.046 --> 57:37.839
for dinner tonight, all right?

57:37.841 --> 57:40.174
Call me if you see
or hear anything.

57:40.176 --> 57:41.216
[Rose] I will.

57:41.218 --> 57:42.511
[Cheryl] Okay.

57:43.847 --> 57:46.930
(siren wailing)

57:46.932 --> 57:50.269
(footsteps approaching)

57:52.147 --> 57:56.693
Joan, are you there?

57:58.736 --> 58:00.280
[Joan] Stay away.

58:01.740 --> 58:02.946
I figured I'd let you know

58:02.948 --> 58:04.450
that we're all okay.

58:05.993 --> 58:07.287
They found us a new shelter.

58:10.039 --> 58:11.707
It's not okay.

58:13.292 --> 58:15.211
It won't be until
they're all dead.

58:17.964 --> 58:18.840
You look terrible.

58:22.051 --> 58:22.968
Go.

58:24.720 --> 58:27.765
Go far away and
never come back here.

58:29.934 --> 58:33.646
Act like you've
never met me before.

58:35.231 --> 58:38.943
Sometimes bad things
happen to good people.

58:39.943 --> 58:40.986
It's not your fault.

58:43.238 --> 58:45.574
Just let me rest in peace.

59:05.803 --> 59:09.432
(ominous atmospheric music)

59:13.644 --> 59:17.856
Miles, you're next.

59:24.113 --> 59:24.986
Where you going, huh?

59:24.988 --> 59:26.279
Where you going?

59:26.281 --> 59:27.156
[Miles] You got her?

59:27.158 --> 59:28.323
Got her, man.

59:28.325 --> 59:30.075
[Miles] You can't
run back to the safety

59:30.077 --> 59:31.118
of your little shelter anymore.

59:31.120 --> 59:31.953
It's gone.

59:31.955 --> 59:32.828
What happened to it?

59:32.830 --> 59:33.830
(laughing)

59:33.832 --> 59:34.913
Why are you doing this?

59:34.915 --> 59:36.040
Killing me isn't
going to do anything.

59:36.042 --> 59:37.457
No, see?

59:37.459 --> 59:38.625
That's where you're wrong.

59:38.627 --> 59:40.044
It's gonna make me feel a lot better.
(laughing)

59:40.046 --> 59:41.671
God, you're cute.
Don't worry.

59:41.673 --> 59:42.839
I'm not gonna shoot you.

59:42.841 --> 59:44.881
I'm just gonna
collect a little debt.

59:44.883 --> 59:46.801
I have nothing
to do with this.

59:46.803 --> 59:47.718
(hard smacking)
(grunting)

59:47.720 --> 59:48.720
You're wrong.

59:48.722 --> 59:49.720
You have everything
to do with this.

59:49.722 --> 59:51.138
It's just business.

59:51.140 --> 59:53.725
You mess with my customers,
I'll mess with you.

59:53.727 --> 59:55.642
Time to take care of
this little annoyance.

59:55.644 --> 59:57.019
Let's do it, baby.

59:57.021 --> 59:58.145
Let's do it.

59:58.147 --> 59:59.814
(wind rushing)

59:59.816 --> 01:00:00.647
(ominous atmospheric music)

01:00:00.649 --> 01:00:01.816
Ah, come on, Joan.

01:00:01.818 --> 01:00:03.316
You wanna dance, Joan, huh?

01:00:03.318 --> 01:00:04.986
Here to save the day again?

01:00:04.988 --> 01:00:05.986
Joan, watch out.

01:00:05.988 --> 01:00:07.573
Enough of your talk, lady.

01:00:09.408 --> 01:00:11.869
(wind rushing)

01:00:13.412 --> 01:00:14.412
I don't know what
the problem is.

01:00:14.414 --> 01:00:15.412
Every time I turn the lights on,

01:00:15.414 --> 01:00:16.497
bitches just be
disappearing on me.

01:00:16.499 --> 01:00:17.122
(laughing)

01:00:17.124 --> 01:00:18.165
(heavy punching)

01:00:18.167 --> 01:00:21.877
Ooh.
(dog barking)

01:00:21.879 --> 01:00:23.587
(light smashing)

01:00:23.589 --> 01:00:24.504
Oh shit.

01:00:24.506 --> 01:00:25.381
Come on, Joan.

01:00:25.383 --> 01:00:26.506
You wanna play?

01:00:26.508 --> 01:00:27.049
Let's fucking play, Joan.

01:00:27.051 --> 01:00:28.091
(wind rushing)

01:00:28.093 --> 01:00:29.761
Fuck this.

01:00:29.763 --> 01:00:30.886
(ominous guitar music)

01:00:30.888 --> 01:00:31.678
(wind rushing)

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.766
(grunting)

01:00:38.772 --> 01:00:43.693
(wind rushing)
(grunting)

01:00:46.361 --> 01:00:51.158
(wind rushing)
(grunting)

01:00:52.702 --> 01:00:57.457
(wind rushing)
(grunting)

01:01:09.385 --> 01:01:14.139
(wind rushing)
(grunting)

01:01:23.482 --> 01:01:27.067
(hard kicking)
(grunting)

01:01:27.069 --> 01:01:28.319
(high-pitch
frequency resonating)

01:01:28.321 --> 01:01:30.904
(nut crunching)

01:01:30.906 --> 01:01:32.031
How 'bout you do
something about Miles,

01:01:32.033 --> 01:01:33.573
'cause he's already out of hand.

01:01:33.575 --> 01:01:35.283
He's gonna get everybody killed.

01:01:35.285 --> 01:01:36.243
It's fine.

01:01:36.245 --> 01:01:37.285
Just keep me updated.

01:01:37.287 --> 01:01:40.080
Jesus, Frank, what
happened to easy money?

01:01:40.082 --> 01:01:42.875
Arson, murder, too
high and level.

01:01:42.877 --> 01:01:43.959
I trust him.

01:01:43.961 --> 01:01:46.046
He knows what he's doing.

01:01:47.131 --> 01:01:48.548
Will you give us a minute?

01:01:48.550 --> 01:01:51.049
[Neal] Will you
get me a sandwich?

01:01:51.051 --> 01:01:53.093
I think you've wasted
enough of our time already.

01:01:53.095 --> 01:01:54.553
Oh, Jesu...

01:01:54.555 --> 01:01:56.888
You've been a good
friend and a good partner.

01:01:56.890 --> 01:01:58.265
There's no reason
that has to change.

01:01:58.267 --> 01:02:00.267
You just need to
have a little faith.

01:02:00.269 --> 01:02:01.603
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:02:04.941 --> 01:02:05.942
Okay.

01:02:13.450 --> 01:02:16.703
Frank, you're not
gonna like this.

01:02:20.289 --> 01:02:21.540
You here to lecture me?

01:02:25.502 --> 01:02:27.127
[Anthony] I wanna
say I'm sorry.

01:02:27.129 --> 01:02:28.923
I heard about what
happened with Cheryl.

01:02:33.928 --> 01:02:35.013
It's not about her.

01:02:36.805 --> 01:02:38.513
Then what is this about?

01:02:38.515 --> 01:02:39.765
Revenge?

01:02:39.767 --> 01:02:41.144
What do you think?

01:02:44.606 --> 01:02:46.066
[Anthony] Getting
all settled in?

01:02:48.776 --> 01:02:50.234
It's nothing.

01:02:50.236 --> 01:02:52.071
Just a few things I
picked up off the street.

01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:57.075
I wish you would listen to me.

01:02:57.077 --> 01:02:58.410
You can't keep doing this.

01:03:00.622 --> 01:03:02.040
You're not gonna stop me.

01:03:03.415 --> 01:03:04.999
It's all I have left.

01:03:05.001 --> 01:03:07.836
You've got me, the
kids, the shelter.

01:03:08.963 --> 01:03:11.421
You mean the shelter
that they burned down?

01:03:11.423 --> 01:03:13.341
We'll get a new one.

01:03:13.343 --> 01:03:16.678
We'll rebuild and move
on, just like you do.

01:03:24.729 --> 01:03:27.899
What makes you so different?

01:03:29.526 --> 01:03:32.026
What makes you stay with me

01:03:32.028 --> 01:03:35.529
when everyone else
has abandoned me?

01:03:35.531 --> 01:03:36.696
Hm?

01:03:36.698 --> 01:03:38.158
I guess I'm just stubborn.

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:41.578
I'm not gonna give up on you.

01:03:53.550 --> 01:03:55.760
(sighing)

01:03:57.845 --> 01:03:58.887
I like that about you.

01:04:12.861 --> 01:04:13.694
Maybe you're right.

01:04:15.446 --> 01:04:19.781
Maybe we should just
forget about the past

01:04:19.783 --> 01:04:22.619
and move away,

01:04:24.164 --> 01:04:25.080
get out of here.

01:04:26.999 --> 01:04:28.001
It's for the best.

01:04:29.752 --> 01:04:33.587
Are we gonna get a house
with a white picket fence

01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:35.589
and be a happy couple, hmm?

01:04:35.591 --> 01:04:36.966
(dramatic atmospheric music)

01:04:36.968 --> 01:04:38.761
Joan, it's not the time.

01:04:42.765 --> 01:04:44.349
Now's the perfect time.

01:04:57.488 --> 01:04:58.405
It's cold.

01:04:59.948 --> 01:05:01.491
Do you want your
shirt back on?

01:05:01.493 --> 01:05:03.119
No, leave it off.

01:05:18.051 --> 01:05:20.593
Wait, this isn't right.

01:05:20.595 --> 01:05:21.596
[Joan] What's wrong?

01:05:23.807 --> 01:05:24.808
This isn't right.

01:05:32.481 --> 01:05:33.399
Relax.

01:05:38.363 --> 01:05:41.783
(light romantic music)

01:06:43.928 --> 01:06:45.096
Stay with me.

01:06:46.890 --> 01:06:48.516
I'm not going anywhere.

01:07:03.531 --> 01:07:07.077
Get me something, anything
that connects to her.

01:07:08.827 --> 01:07:10.410
I got nothing.

01:07:10.412 --> 01:07:13.413
There's gotta be
a way to get to her.

01:07:13.415 --> 01:07:16.000
You boys, always
thinking with your head

01:07:16.002 --> 01:07:17.087
and not your hearts.

01:07:18.463 --> 01:07:20.006
You gotta follow her heart.

01:07:20.756 --> 01:07:23.256
That's how you get to her.

01:07:23.258 --> 01:07:25.677
Remember her ex-boyfriend,
that social worker?

01:07:27.097 --> 01:07:28.553
Seems he's been
spending a lot of time

01:07:28.555 --> 01:07:29.723
at this warehouse lately.

01:07:32.685 --> 01:07:34.187
The 63rd Street warehouse.

01:07:35.687 --> 01:07:37.270
It's been boarded up forever.

01:07:37.272 --> 01:07:38.605
It's just a tax write-off.

01:07:38.607 --> 01:07:39.651
What's so special
about that place?

01:07:40.609 --> 01:07:41.443
I don't know.

01:07:48.868 --> 01:07:52.537
Well, let's head down there
first thing tomorrow morning,

01:07:52.539 --> 01:07:53.455
find out.

01:08:04.216 --> 01:08:06.385
Ho ho, my man.

01:08:07.136 --> 01:08:08.220
Thanks.

01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:12.140
How's the head.

01:08:12.142 --> 01:08:14.183
Ah, just a mild concussion.

01:08:14.185 --> 01:08:15.642
Doc said I'll be good
in a couple weeks,

01:08:15.644 --> 01:08:17.478
but in the meantime...

01:08:17.479 --> 01:08:19.397
(grunting)

01:08:19.399 --> 01:08:20.982
gave me some of the good stuff.

01:08:20.984 --> 01:08:22.316
(laughing)

01:08:22.318 --> 01:08:24.318
Maybe you oughta go
home and just rest up.

01:08:24.319 --> 01:08:25.569
Yeah, I wish I could, man,

01:08:25.571 --> 01:08:28.322
but Frank has got
guys working overtime.

01:08:28.323 --> 01:08:30.660
It's like he's on some sort
of crusade or something.

01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:35.497
Well, I'd rather
not talk about that.

01:08:36.999 --> 01:08:38.624
Yeah?

01:08:38.626 --> 01:08:39.627
Why not?

01:08:40.169 --> 01:08:41.796
All right,

01:08:44.006 --> 01:08:46.843
between you and me,
just don't feel right.

01:08:48.926 --> 01:08:52.179
Look, I've been with
Frank a lot of years

01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:55.224
and we have done
some crazy shit,

01:08:55.225 --> 01:08:58.145
but nothing like
this, killing kids,

01:08:59.145 --> 01:09:00.689
burning down a homeless shelter.

01:09:03.524 --> 01:09:04.401
Whatever it takes.

01:09:05.444 --> 01:09:06.986
I mean, it's just
business, right?

01:09:06.988 --> 01:09:08.278
Business,

01:09:08.279 --> 01:09:09.531
don't make me laugh.

01:09:11.242 --> 01:09:12.993
There's gotta be
a line somewhere.

01:09:14.453 --> 01:09:16.038
How far are you willing to go?

01:09:17.538 --> 01:09:19.457
How much are we
willing to sacrifice?

01:09:21.127 --> 01:09:22.212
I don't know, man.

01:09:23.212 --> 01:09:24.337
Shit, I just work here.

01:09:28.801 --> 01:09:29.969
I gotta get home.

01:09:30.886 --> 01:09:32.219
My old lady's on me

01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:34.470
about all the time I'm
putting in around here.

01:09:34.473 --> 01:09:36.557
Hey, I wish I had
an old lady on me.

01:09:36.559 --> 01:09:37.394
(grunting)

01:09:38.227 --> 01:09:40.143
We have a big
day tomorrow, dog.

01:09:40.145 --> 01:09:41.729
You should rest up.

01:09:43.107 --> 01:09:43.982
Ah.

01:09:46.734 --> 01:09:50.198
(light atmospheric music)

01:09:55.285 --> 01:09:57.830
(bird chirping)

01:10:19.436 --> 01:10:21.187
We've got her.

01:10:37.494 --> 01:10:39.455
It's too bad your
girlfriend's not here.

01:10:40.623 --> 01:10:42.290
(ominous atmospheric music)

01:10:42.292 --> 01:10:44.502
She's not around much
during the day, is she?

01:10:46.712 --> 01:10:49.131
Look, we're done
with all this.

01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:51.301
We're leaving.

01:10:52.135 --> 01:10:53.136
You won.

01:10:58.475 --> 01:10:59.642
I have a message for Joan.

01:11:01.226 --> 01:11:03.020
It's very important
that she get it.

01:11:04.939 --> 01:11:06.688
Yeah, what's the message?

01:11:06.690 --> 01:11:10.568
(knife stabbing)
(thudding)

01:11:10.570 --> 01:11:11.988
That's the message.

01:11:24.333 --> 01:11:25.251
Who's there?

01:11:28.378 --> 01:11:30.545
You've got a lot
of nerve coming here.

01:11:30.547 --> 01:11:32.216
Haven't you caused
enough damage?

01:11:33.802 --> 01:11:35.053
I'm sorry about what happened.

01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:41.349
Look, I know you
probably hate me,

01:11:41.351 --> 01:11:44.393
but you're the only
person who can help.

01:11:44.395 --> 01:11:45.728
I've been looking
everywhere for Anthony.

01:11:45.730 --> 01:11:46.689
I can't find him.

01:11:47.690 --> 01:11:49.357
[Cheryl] You
don't know, do you?

01:11:49.359 --> 01:11:50.441
I don't have time for this.

01:11:50.443 --> 01:11:51.569
Just tell me where he is.

01:11:52.529 --> 01:11:54.194
(dramatic atmospheric music)

01:11:54.196 --> 01:11:55.448
He's not anywhere.

01:11:56.365 --> 01:11:57.533
He's dead.

01:12:02.122 --> 01:12:03.123
Dead?

01:12:04.164 --> 01:12:05.872
What do you mean dead?

01:12:05.874 --> 01:12:08.251
[Cheryl] I mean he's gone
and it's all your fault.

01:12:08.253 --> 01:12:09.376
If you hadn't gotten him
mixed up in all this,

01:12:09.378 --> 01:12:10.587
he'd still be here.

01:12:19.471 --> 01:12:22.559
Don't you dare judge me.

01:12:23.810 --> 01:12:26.728
You have no idea what
I've been through.

01:12:26.730 --> 01:12:29.104
You sit up here in your
big comfortable house,

01:12:29.106 --> 01:12:30.190
away from the world.

01:12:32.276 --> 01:12:35.279
You don't know what it's like
for people like us out there.

01:12:37.198 --> 01:12:39.072
I've been doing
this a long time.

01:12:39.074 --> 01:12:41.200
I see the damage you people do.

01:12:41.202 --> 01:12:42.287
Why do you think I do this?

01:12:43.370 --> 01:12:45.789
It's to protect the world
from criminals like you.

01:12:50.043 --> 01:12:56.381
I did everything I could
do to survive on the streets,

01:12:56.383 --> 01:12:58.802
but don't you blame me.

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:03.930
I would've never done
anything to hurt him

01:13:03.932 --> 01:13:06.310
or cause him any kind of pain.

01:13:12.484 --> 01:13:13.735
I loved him.

01:13:21.117 --> 01:13:23.828
(siren wailing)

01:13:34.631 --> 01:13:36.296
[Man] Hey.

01:13:36.298 --> 01:13:37.300
I know you.

01:13:39.886 --> 01:13:41.428
[Joan] You don't
wanna know me.

01:13:45.016 --> 01:13:46.643
Yeah, I do.

01:13:54.818 --> 01:13:57.153
(grunting)

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:00.155
Seems like we always get stuck.

01:14:04.619 --> 01:14:05.995
Wheel goin' 'round.

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:08.914
No matter how far we go,

01:14:11.458 --> 01:14:13.461
we're always right
back where we started.

01:14:14.628 --> 01:14:17.089
No matter how much pain and
sorrow they've caused us,

01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:20.635
we keep going back to
that source of pain.

01:14:25.848 --> 01:14:28.014
Pretty wise
words coming from a

01:14:28.016 --> 01:14:30.185
prince of the streets,
like yourself.

01:14:31.311 --> 01:14:32.312
[Man] I try.

01:14:33.897 --> 01:14:37.025
Here, have some.

01:14:44.159 --> 01:14:47.117
(laughing)

01:14:47.119 --> 01:14:48.872
Genuine rotgut.

01:14:50.205 --> 01:14:51.207
Nice.

01:15:07.848 --> 01:15:10.558
(wind rushing)

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:13.271
(heavy breathing)

01:15:16.482 --> 01:15:17.398
No no no.

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:18.523
I know it.

01:15:18.525 --> 01:15:20.319
I know it's tough.

01:15:21.154 --> 01:15:22.903
What can you do, but to sit back

01:15:22.905 --> 01:15:26.823
and look up at the
stars, revel at them.

01:15:26.825 --> 01:15:28.410
Revel at the glory.

01:15:30.245 --> 01:15:33.747
Isn't it amazing, universe?

01:15:33.749 --> 01:15:37.210
I don't give a fuck
about the universe.

01:15:37.212 --> 01:15:38.296
Anthony's dead.

01:15:39.297 --> 01:15:41.257
If it weren't for me,
he'd still be alive.

01:15:42.633 --> 01:15:44.593
(crying)

01:15:46.762 --> 01:15:49.265
I'm sure this
Anthony was special.

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:57.941
I wish I could bring
him back, but I can't.

01:16:03.946 --> 01:16:04.989
Thanks.

01:16:09.410 --> 01:16:14.415
(wind rushing)
(voices whispering)

01:16:16.543 --> 01:16:19.129
God, won't they ever shut up?

01:16:22.798 --> 01:16:23.882
[Man] Who are
you talking about?

01:16:28.555 --> 01:16:29.931
You can't hear them?

01:16:30.848 --> 01:16:32.307
They're all around us.

01:16:36.937 --> 01:16:39.356
(low rumbling)

01:16:39.857 --> 01:16:41.443
[Anthony] Joan.

01:16:52.494 --> 01:16:54.163
Frank, you son of a bitch.

01:16:56.082 --> 01:16:57.167
[Man] Now you've done it.

01:16:59.377 --> 01:17:00.253
(speaks indistinctly)

01:17:02.629 --> 01:17:04.673
Blood will fill the
streets tonight.

01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:12.347
Yes, but I will
do the bloodletting.

01:17:14.350 --> 01:17:17.809
You have the mark upon you.

01:17:17.811 --> 01:17:19.480
Leave now before it spreads.

01:17:23.025 --> 01:17:25.694
(wind rushing)

01:17:30.867 --> 01:17:34.412
(ominous orchestral music)

01:17:38.708 --> 01:17:41.878
Joan, at last.

01:17:43.712 --> 01:17:45.547
Well, I see all the
stories are true.

01:17:46.507 --> 01:17:47.966
Very impressive.

01:17:49.135 --> 01:17:51.344
But you've also become
a real pain in the ass,

01:17:51.346 --> 01:17:53.973
sticking your fingers into
other people's business.

01:17:55.182 --> 01:17:56.350
Why'd you kill Anthony?

01:17:57.685 --> 01:17:59.312
He never did anything to you.

01:18:00.855 --> 01:18:02.063
I didn't kill him.

01:18:02.065 --> 01:18:03.063
You did.

01:18:03.065 --> 01:18:05.734
[Joan] We both
know that's not true.

01:18:07.236 --> 01:18:08.570
What was I supposed to do?

01:18:09.864 --> 01:18:12.240
You turned your back on us.

01:18:12.242 --> 01:18:14.242
You betrayed my trust.

01:18:14.244 --> 01:18:16.411
You didn't deserve my trust.

01:18:16.413 --> 01:18:17.830
You never did.

01:18:18.832 --> 01:18:20.249
I just finally realized that.

01:18:21.376 --> 01:18:23.086
Poor little precocious Joan,

01:18:24.294 --> 01:18:25.922
thinks she's the
top of the class,

01:18:27.423 --> 01:18:29.215
but she doesn't realize
without me protecting her,

01:18:29.217 --> 01:18:30.927
she'd have been dead
a long time ago.

01:18:32.971 --> 01:18:35.595
I'm here to collect a debt

01:18:35.597 --> 01:18:37.809
and you're not gonna stop me.

01:18:40.102 --> 01:18:41.479
I don't think that you will.

01:18:42.939 --> 01:18:44.441
Why's that?

01:18:52.656 --> 01:18:55.452
Let's take a walk
down memory lane, hm?

01:18:56.703 --> 01:19:03.793
When I was a kid, I didn't have
much going for me, aimless.

01:19:05.503 --> 01:19:07.711
But there was a perfectly
good war going on

01:19:07.713 --> 01:19:11.216
on the other side of the
world, called Desert Storm,

01:19:12.342 --> 01:19:13.510
sounded romantic.

01:19:14.471 --> 01:19:16.470
So, I signed up to
fight terrorists

01:19:16.472 --> 01:19:19.432
and they shipped me off
to the middle of nowhere,

01:19:19.434 --> 01:19:21.475
but we were
completely unprepared.

01:19:21.477 --> 01:19:24.689
They had no idea what
we were up against.

01:19:25.731 --> 01:19:29.276
It was sheer hell.

01:19:30.403 --> 01:19:37.783
Snakes, scorpions, heat,
IEDS, and roadside bombers.

01:19:37.785 --> 01:19:40.120
And I was a specialist.

01:19:41.288 --> 01:19:45.582
So, I spent months at a
stretch alone in the desert,

01:19:45.584 --> 01:19:48.171
nothing but sand and desolation.

01:19:51.632 --> 01:19:53.842
I should've died there,

01:19:56.512 --> 01:19:59.306
but there are also dark
forces in the desert,

01:20:00.475 --> 01:20:03.895
very powerful,
very primal forces.

01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:06.940
And so I...

01:20:08.525 --> 01:20:09.359
survived.

01:20:11.026 --> 01:20:12.194
And I came back

01:20:13.238 --> 01:20:16.365
and I brought some of
that darkness with me.

01:20:18.952 --> 01:20:21.536
That's a real nice story,

01:20:21.538 --> 01:20:24.413
but what's it got to do with me?

01:20:24.415 --> 01:20:26.042
We all have our own demons.

01:20:27.334 --> 01:20:29.460
There's a darkness
on your soul, Joan.

01:20:29.462 --> 01:20:31.545
I saw it when we first met.

01:20:31.547 --> 01:20:34.341
I knew were we meant
to be together.

01:20:37.595 --> 01:20:38.680
Don't fight it.

01:20:39.596 --> 01:20:41.557
We're all one big happy family.

01:20:44.476 --> 01:20:46.104
Join us, Joan.

01:20:48.897 --> 01:20:51.189
I can never join you,

01:20:51.191 --> 01:20:53.901
not after everything
you've done.

01:20:53.903 --> 01:20:56.153
What I've done is
help you to become

01:20:56.155 --> 01:20:59.698
who you truly are, by
stripping away your weakness,

01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:02.410
the last remnant
of your humanity.

01:21:02.412 --> 01:21:04.079
I have freed you.

01:21:05.539 --> 01:21:07.415
And now it's time
for you to come home

01:21:07.417 --> 01:21:08.793
where you belong.

01:21:11.212 --> 01:21:15.133
I think I'll
decline, thank you.

01:21:20.721 --> 01:21:21.722
I'm very disappointed...

01:21:24.059 --> 01:21:25.185
but...

01:21:26.061 --> 01:21:27.103
it's been fun.

01:21:34.110 --> 01:21:36.568
(intense electronic rock music)

01:21:36.570 --> 01:21:38.113
[Joan] What are you gonna do?

01:21:41.284 --> 01:21:43.785
(wind rushing)

01:21:43.787 --> 01:21:46.203
You think you're the
only one with tricks?

01:21:46.205 --> 01:21:47.287
Watch this.

01:21:47.289 --> 01:21:50.625
(screeching)
(screaming)

01:21:50.627 --> 01:21:52.751
How'd you do that?

01:21:52.753 --> 01:21:56.964
Been around long enough
to learn a few things.

01:21:56.966 --> 01:22:01.678
(grunting)
(wind rushing)

01:22:06.101 --> 01:22:10.730
(screeching)
(grunting)

01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:23.782
(grunting)
(heavy breathing)

01:22:23.784 --> 01:22:25.369
Very disappointed.

01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:28.163
Such a waste of potential.

01:22:29.790 --> 01:22:33.667
I won't stop until I kill you.

01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:38.341
(grunting)
(wind rushing)

01:22:43.221 --> 01:22:46.179
(light atmospheric music)

01:22:46.181 --> 01:22:47.182
Hello?

01:22:51.687 --> 01:22:54.399
(light moaning)

01:22:55.941 --> 01:22:57.526
Anthony, is that you?

01:22:58.986 --> 01:23:01.530
(light moaning)

01:23:04.534 --> 01:23:05.452
I can hear you.

01:23:07.537 --> 01:23:10.039
(light moaning)

01:23:14.918 --> 01:23:15.836
I can hear you.

01:23:29.892 --> 01:23:31.517
(lights powering off)

01:23:31.519 --> 01:23:35.065
(ominous atmospheric music)

01:23:44.239 --> 01:23:45.449
Anthony?

01:23:46.743 --> 01:23:48.326
It's me, Joan.

01:23:48.328 --> 01:23:49.245
Stay away from me!

01:23:53.208 --> 01:23:54.667
Let me help you.

01:23:55.959 --> 01:23:56.877
[Anthony] What do you want?

01:23:59.756 --> 01:24:01.758
I'm here to save you.

01:24:05.762 --> 01:24:07.886
[Anthony] She thinks
she can save me,

01:24:07.888 --> 01:24:09.223
but she's mistaken.

01:24:09.848 --> 01:24:11.434
I'm beyond redemption.

01:24:14.104 --> 01:24:15.562
I don't understand.

01:24:17.147 --> 01:24:18.357
She doesn't understand.

01:24:19.734 --> 01:24:21.444
Perhaps she never will.

01:24:22.986 --> 01:24:26.908
Anthony is dead, gone forever.

01:24:28.325 --> 01:24:29.783
There's only I.

01:24:29.785 --> 01:24:32.497
(voice echoing)

01:24:33.414 --> 01:24:34.623
[Joan] And who are you?

01:24:40.754 --> 01:24:45.718
I am your past
come to haunt you.

01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:58.103
[Joan] Stop this now.

01:24:58.105 --> 01:25:01.358
You are Anthony and I am Joan.

01:25:08.574 --> 01:25:09.575
Joan.

01:25:10.827 --> 01:25:12.285
I knew a Joan.

01:25:12.287 --> 01:25:14.828
She was tough, but fair.

01:25:14.830 --> 01:25:16.915
Unfortunately, she died.

01:25:18.083 --> 01:25:19.459
No.

01:25:19.461 --> 01:25:21.085
No.

01:25:21.087 --> 01:25:22.711
I'm right here.

01:25:22.713 --> 01:25:24.841
I'm right here in front of you.

01:25:27.843 --> 01:25:28.845
You're confusing me.

01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:36.727
Pull yourself together.

01:25:37.436 --> 01:25:39.687
Forget about the past.

01:25:39.689 --> 01:25:43.234
We're here now and
I need your help.

01:25:47.321 --> 01:25:52.077
We're gonna find the men
who did this to you, to us.

01:25:53.285 --> 01:25:55.577
But I need you to be strong.

01:25:55.579 --> 01:25:56.705
Can you do that for me?

01:26:00.376 --> 01:26:01.377
I will be strong.

01:26:05.714 --> 01:26:06.673
Good.

01:26:09.511 --> 01:26:11.885
Now let's go find this asshole

01:26:11.887 --> 01:26:14.265
and teach him not
to mess with us.

01:26:23.149 --> 01:26:25.860
(wind rushing)

01:26:32.409 --> 01:26:33.660
Okay.

01:26:34.744 --> 01:26:35.912
Look around.

01:26:36.745 --> 01:26:38.121
There's gotta be
some sort of clue

01:26:38.123 --> 01:26:40.415
as to where he's hiding.

01:26:40.417 --> 01:26:41.874
[Anthony] He has
left the building.

01:26:41.876 --> 01:26:45.003
He's gone, never to return.

01:26:46.881 --> 01:26:49.968
(light wind howling)

01:26:55.097 --> 01:26:56.098
Leave it.

01:27:03.522 --> 01:27:04.857
I can smell him.

01:27:07.944 --> 01:27:09.195
He's gotta be here somewhere.

01:27:10.279 --> 01:27:13.073
(wind rushing)

01:27:14.409 --> 01:27:18.618
Come on, Frank, where are you?

01:27:18.620 --> 01:27:21.665
(voices whispering)

01:27:38.641 --> 01:27:39.642
No.

01:27:43.645 --> 01:27:44.563
It's no use.

01:27:46.065 --> 01:27:48.443
He's hiding somewhere and
he doesn't wanna be found.

01:27:51.029 --> 01:27:53.406
(screeching)

01:28:02.748 --> 01:28:04.249
I bet I know someone who knows.

01:28:07.503 --> 01:28:10.339
(light rock music)

01:28:16.887 --> 01:28:17.805
Hello, Neal.

01:28:20.391 --> 01:28:21.392
Hey, Joan.

01:28:23.311 --> 01:28:24.518
[Joan] Here to collect a debt.

01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:25.771
Yeah, I know.

01:28:28.482 --> 01:28:30.316
What we did to you was terrible.

01:28:30.318 --> 01:28:32.320
I didn't have anything
to do with it.

01:28:34.029 --> 01:28:35.697
I'm not here for you.

01:28:36.533 --> 01:28:37.867
Where's Frank?

01:28:38.575 --> 01:28:39.702
I know where he is.

01:28:40.744 --> 01:28:42.329
I need you to let me go.

01:28:45.290 --> 01:28:46.749
Just show us where he is

01:28:46.751 --> 01:28:48.878
and you won't get hurt.

01:28:59.221 --> 01:29:01.390
Come on, this way.

01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:05.477
A little feature that wasn't
on the real estate listing.

01:29:07.230 --> 01:29:09.065
Joint's got a safe room.

01:29:19.868 --> 01:29:25.078
(door closing)
(low rumbling)

01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:28.418
Ah, you finally found
my little sanctuary.

01:29:29.668 --> 01:29:30.669
Well done.

01:29:31.587 --> 01:29:33.213
And I see you brought a friend.

01:29:34.257 --> 01:29:37.093
Behold, I see an
angel before me.

01:29:38.427 --> 01:29:41.888
But even Lucifer
was an angel once.

01:29:41.890 --> 01:29:45.433
You and I both know
that's not why I'm here.

01:29:45.435 --> 01:29:48.772
Yes, and I'm very
disappointed, Joan.

01:29:50.272 --> 01:29:52.107
After all this,

01:29:53.234 --> 01:29:55.236
after everything
I've done for you,

01:29:56.529 --> 01:29:58.448
you turn your back on
your father like this.

01:30:03.244 --> 01:30:04.954
Very cute.

01:30:05.788 --> 01:30:08.163
You're not my father.

01:30:08.165 --> 01:30:10.166
My father was an abusive asshole

01:30:10.168 --> 01:30:11.628
and an alcoholic.

01:30:13.462 --> 01:30:15.505
You're birth-father, yes,

01:30:15.507 --> 01:30:18.925
but I like to think that
you have come to think of me

01:30:18.927 --> 01:30:20.470
as a father too.

01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:26.309
Don't you flatter yourself.

01:30:30.355 --> 01:30:35.858
When I first met you,
you were a street punk,

01:30:35.860 --> 01:30:38.947
a kid, but I took you in

01:30:41.615 --> 01:30:44.325
and I molded you, turned
you into the killer

01:30:44.327 --> 01:30:45.453
that you are today.

01:30:48.832 --> 01:30:51.290
Who told you how to hold a gun?

01:30:51.292 --> 01:30:52.293
I did.

01:30:53.168 --> 01:30:54.669
Who taught you how to fight?

01:30:54.671 --> 01:30:56.170
I did.

01:30:56.172 --> 01:30:59.509
Who taught you how
to love, how to fuck?

01:31:00.968 --> 01:31:03.678
Well, that was a long time ago

01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:05.347
and that time has passed.

01:31:07.516 --> 01:31:11.810
Now it's time for the student
to become the teacher.

01:31:11.812 --> 01:31:15.355
(ominous atmospheric music)

01:31:15.357 --> 01:31:18.026
(wind rushing)

01:31:18.861 --> 01:31:20.904
(laughing)

01:31:21.823 --> 01:31:22.824
Very well.

01:31:23.283 --> 01:31:24.367
[Anthony] This isn't good.

01:31:26.327 --> 01:31:27.201
(wind rushing)

01:31:27.203 --> 01:31:28.452
(grunting)

01:31:28.454 --> 01:31:29.120
(wind rushing)

01:31:29.122 --> 01:31:30.914
Leave her alone.

01:31:32.542 --> 01:31:35.003
(screeching)

01:31:35.878 --> 01:31:38.088
(choking)

01:31:41.551 --> 01:31:44.763
Now, it's just
you and me now,

01:31:45.805 --> 01:31:47.054
just like it's always been.

01:31:47.056 --> 01:31:48.389
What a shame.

01:31:48.391 --> 01:31:50.265
We make such a good pair,

01:31:50.267 --> 01:31:52.477
but that's all over now, Joan.

01:31:52.479 --> 01:31:54.731
(choking)

01:31:55.481 --> 01:31:56.732
No.

01:32:02.321 --> 01:32:03.779
(wind rushing)

01:32:03.781 --> 01:32:06.616
(grunting)

01:32:06.618 --> 01:32:09.245
(heavy punching)

01:32:13.792 --> 01:32:16.084
Joan, what are you doing?

01:32:16.086 --> 01:32:17.419
Stop, stop.

01:32:19.004 --> 01:32:21.839
(heavy breathing)

01:32:21.841 --> 01:32:22.881
Is this some kind of trick?

01:32:22.883 --> 01:32:24.300
No, it's me.

01:32:24.302 --> 01:32:25.303
It's Frank.

01:32:27.388 --> 01:32:30.100
Kid, I didn't have a choice.

01:32:32.435 --> 01:32:33.645
I had to survive.

01:32:35.771 --> 01:32:39.359
I had a wife, kids,
waiting for me at home.

01:32:43.029 --> 01:32:44.948
I did what I had to do.

01:32:50.203 --> 01:32:51.454
I'm sorry, kid.

01:33:05.635 --> 01:33:08.262
(wind rushing)

01:33:09.888 --> 01:33:11.141
I'm sorry too, Frank.

01:33:14.644 --> 01:33:18.314
(dramatic atmospheric music)

01:33:20.107 --> 01:33:22.944
(heavy breathing)

01:33:32.662 --> 01:33:33.495
Anthony.

01:33:36.708 --> 01:33:38.499
Anthony.

01:33:38.501 --> 01:33:41.669
Anthony, don't do this to
me again, Anthony, please.

01:33:41.671 --> 01:33:43.295
Please.

01:33:43.297 --> 01:33:45.675
(ominous tone)

01:33:49.012 --> 01:33:50.678
Please.

01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:53.391
(low breathing)

01:34:01.690 --> 01:34:02.691
You.

01:34:04.694 --> 01:34:07.236
I thought I killed you already.

01:34:07.238 --> 01:34:09.362
You can't kill
me, little girl.

01:34:09.364 --> 01:34:11.532
I'm already a part of you.

01:34:11.534 --> 01:34:13.369
There's no point in fighting.

01:34:14.244 --> 01:34:15.245
I've already won.

01:34:16.663 --> 01:34:18.538
You haven't won shit.

01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:20.207
Haven't I?

01:34:20.209 --> 01:34:22.376
What are you feeling right now?

01:34:22.378 --> 01:34:26.296
Hatred, anger, a
lust for vengeance?

01:34:26.298 --> 01:34:27.381
That's me.

01:34:27.383 --> 01:34:29.051
I'm already inside your head.

01:34:30.261 --> 01:34:35.555
The more you hate, the
more we become entwined.

01:34:35.557 --> 01:34:40.560
(wind rushing)
(grunting)

01:34:40.562 --> 01:34:42.854
(speaks indistinctly)

01:34:42.856 --> 01:34:44.064
(intense percussive music)

01:34:44.066 --> 01:34:45.273
Delicious.

01:34:45.275 --> 01:34:50.028
(liquid squishing and crunching)

01:34:50.030 --> 01:34:52.117
(gasping)

01:34:59.415 --> 01:35:03.251
There's no place that you
can go that I won't find you.

01:35:03.253 --> 01:35:06.631
We are bound to each other.

01:35:08.717 --> 01:35:12.426
[Joan] I'm sorry,
Anthony, I'm sorry.

01:35:12.428 --> 01:35:14.722
(gasping)

01:35:19.101 --> 01:35:21.978
You're alive, you're alive.

01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:24.566
(wind rushing)

01:35:25.775 --> 01:35:27.152
I remember who I was.

01:35:32.949 --> 01:35:35.952
[Joan] I refuse to
play by your rules.

01:35:37.537 --> 01:35:39.286
You said I had a decision.

01:35:39.288 --> 01:35:40.414
You said I had a choice.

01:35:42.208 --> 01:35:44.461
I've made my decision

01:35:45.211 --> 01:35:49.423
and this is what I choose.

01:35:52.635 --> 01:35:56.636
(liquid squishing)
(wind rushing)

01:35:56.638 --> 01:36:01.019
Well, this, this
is more powerful.

01:36:05.481 --> 01:36:06.690
I'm sorry, Frank,

01:36:08.318 --> 01:36:10.070
but it's time for
you to go home.

01:36:10.986 --> 01:36:14.322
(wind rushing)

01:36:14.324 --> 01:36:18.161
(dramatic orchestral music)

01:36:37.555 --> 01:36:38.597
[Man] So, have you seen
her since that night?

01:36:39.891 --> 01:36:43.017
I like to think that
she's still out there.

01:36:43.019 --> 01:36:45.355
I don't know, I think I saw
her a couple nights ago.

01:36:46.689 --> 01:36:48.398
I was walking home late at night

01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:51.651
and I could feel someone
watching me from the shadows.

01:36:51.653 --> 01:36:53.195
I bet it was her
watching over me.

01:36:54.864 --> 01:36:55.906
I think you're seeing things.

01:36:57.033 --> 01:36:58.032
I'm gonna be late.

01:36:58.034 --> 01:36:59.367
Gotta go.

01:36:59.369 --> 01:37:00.992
All right, be safe.

01:37:00.994 --> 01:37:02.536
Oh, don't worry.

01:37:02.538 --> 01:37:04.287
I'm sure Joan will keep me safe.

01:37:04.289 --> 01:37:06.708
(laughing)

01:37:10.003 --> 01:37:10.836
(whistling)

01:37:10.838 --> 01:37:13.380
(ominous atmospheric music)

01:37:13.382 --> 01:37:15.385
Hey, where you running?

01:37:32.193 --> 01:37:33.734
What are you doing out
here so late by yourself?

01:37:33.736 --> 01:37:35.944
[Man] Leave me alone.
I ain't got no money.

01:37:35.946 --> 01:37:37.612
What do you mean
you ain't go no money?

01:37:37.614 --> 01:37:39.240
(wind rushing)

01:37:39.242 --> 01:37:44.247
Hey, where you're going,
you don't need any money.

01:37:45.539 --> 01:37:46.582
Leave him alone.

01:37:47.583 --> 01:37:48.916
What are you
gonna do about it?

01:37:48.918 --> 01:37:51.171
No, dude dude
dude, that's Joan.

01:37:52.172 --> 01:37:54.255
Yeah, you should
do what she says.

01:37:54.257 --> 01:37:55.967
You don't wanna get
on her bad side.

01:37:57.510 --> 01:37:58.762
[Thug] Let's get outta here.

01:38:09.396 --> 01:38:10.772
[Joan] You should
watch yourself.

01:38:10.774 --> 01:38:12.191
It's dangerous
out here at night.

01:38:15.986 --> 01:38:20.406
(driving electronic rock music)

01:38:20.408 --> 01:38:21.450
Thanks.
