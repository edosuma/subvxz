LIKE FOR LIKES

02:12.327 --> 02:14.102
The end

02:26.641 --> 02:27.641
Cut!

02:27.942 --> 02:29.944
That was good, but once more!

02:30.178 --> 02:31.011
One more take.

02:31.012 --> 02:32.012
Okay.

02:32.714 --> 02:34.159
If it was good, why go again?

02:41.723 --> 02:44.431
I want to have your skin.

02:46.528 --> 02:47.528
Cut!

02:49.097 --> 02:50.132
Was it good?

02:50.832 --> 02:52.743
Hello, afternoon.

02:53.434 --> 02:57.109
It's been too long,
when's your comeback?

02:57.205 --> 02:58.616
Right, the comeback.

02:59.507 --> 03:04.178
They say you mature
after military discharge,

03:04.179 --> 03:05.817
but I think I became more timid.

03:05.914 --> 03:08.451
I'm just waiting for
a good project.

03:08.816 --> 03:10.420
I'll come back soon.

03:10.718 --> 03:12.720
Seriously, ASAP!

03:12.887 --> 03:16.232
I was so surprised
during research today,

03:16.291 --> 03:19.272
in a recent poll of
the most romantic kiss scene,

03:19.327 --> 03:23.537
You're My Black Hole's
Burberry coat kiss is still â™ª1.

03:23.731 --> 03:24.903
Really?

03:25.733 --> 03:28.769
That series is from
before I was drafted.

03:28.770 --> 03:31.905
It feels good to hear that
it's still loved by many.

03:31.906 --> 03:32.782
Thank you.

03:32.874 --> 03:34.547
It's crazy, really.

03:34.642 --> 03:36.343
Perhaps due in part,

03:36.344 --> 03:40.656
you're so in demand
in China and Japan.

03:40.748 --> 03:43.285
How crazy!
- Don't do that!

03:43.484 --> 03:45.760
You're precious,
I won't share you!

03:45.954 --> 03:46.954
Stop it!

03:55.196 --> 03:56.196
Aren't you gonna answer?

03:56.564 --> 03:57.564
It's okay.

03:59.767 --> 04:00.767
Looks so good!

04:01.636 --> 04:02.636
Should I answer?

04:03.004 --> 04:04.142
Amazing Writer Ms. Jo

04:05.974 --> 04:07.180
Come on...

04:09.544 --> 04:10.545
Ms. Jo?

04:11.512 --> 04:12.889
No, not at all.

04:13.214 --> 04:14.420
Of course.

04:15.216 --> 04:16.216
Okay.

04:18.753 --> 04:20.232
- Damn you...
- Is this enough?

04:20.488 --> 04:21.488
Yeah, yeah.

04:21.555 --> 04:22.466
You leaving?

04:22.557 --> 04:24.264
Drop this off
at the Chinese place.

04:24.492 --> 04:27.336
How does a restaurant
miss onion inventory?

04:30.298 --> 04:31.538
Hey honey.

04:31.633 --> 04:34.170
Hi, are you looking into
our first home'?

04:34.302 --> 04:37.249
Yeah, I've seen a few homes.

04:37.639 --> 04:39.983
- Didn't I tell you?
- When?

04:40.041 --> 04:41.041
Mr. Jung!

04:41.409 --> 04:43.582
I dropped car key in the sewer,

04:43.845 --> 04:45.605
- my client's waiting...
- Are you listening?

04:46.481 --> 04:48.290
Honey, I'll call you back in 5.

04:48.349 --> 04:49.760
- I love you!
- Hey!

04:50.418 --> 04:51.897
Must you help everyone?

04:52.153 --> 04:54.463
You'll grow out of it
when she dumps you.

04:54.555 --> 04:55.727
You still here?

04:57.125 --> 04:58.627
How do you like the female lead?

04:58.926 --> 05:01.328
She's amazing, she's like you.

05:01.329 --> 05:03.400
You can finally act.

05:03.731 --> 05:06.211
Status on casting?
Any words from Kim Woo-bin?

05:07.502 --> 05:09.106
No answer yet...

05:09.704 --> 05:13.516
So you'll just wait
for your phone to ring?

05:13.808 --> 05:16.880
It's the weekend,
I'll call tomorrow.

05:17.779 --> 05:21.056
It didn't stop you from sending
product placement list.

05:21.783 --> 05:23.888
You have to start
making decisions.

05:24.319 --> 05:26.356
Must you start with ads?

05:26.721 --> 05:29.099
- This isn't the time.
- No, of course not.

05:29.390 --> 05:31.563
Is TV biz child's play for you?

05:32.960 --> 05:35.804
No, it doesn't feel
that way at all...

05:37.465 --> 05:38.705
Are you drunk?

05:41.569 --> 05:44.015
She's promoted to
business class now.

05:44.105 --> 05:44.913
Why?

05:44.972 --> 05:47.885
She sucked up to
the manager pretty hard.

05:49.077 --> 05:50.988
Where's my promotion?

05:51.245 --> 05:54.454
The only way to keep dignity
is to run my own business.

05:55.516 --> 05:57.223
You're a broken record.

05:57.518 --> 05:59.395
So when'll you open
your bag shop?

05:59.487 --> 06:03.264
I got the lease
and the interior's starting.

06:03.358 --> 06:06.066
- Yeah? And this job?
- Quit, of course.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.003
Does the manager know
you're quitting?

06:08.830 --> 06:09.830
Manager!

06:10.965 --> 06:14.276
I bought it on the way,
it's great whiskey.

06:16.637 --> 06:18.139
Must one live like that?

06:18.506 --> 06:20.340
We all have self-respect.

06:20.341 --> 06:23.914
I bought this in Hong Kong.

06:28.716 --> 06:30.821
London Flights Sale

06:33.554 --> 06:35.261
EJ, have some yams.

06:38.559 --> 06:40.766
No wonder mom left him
for London.

06:43.464 --> 06:45.932
Not gonna eat?
Your loss.

06:45.933 --> 06:47.207
More for me.

06:47.835 --> 06:51.442
Going to see Su-ho?
Take some yams.

06:55.843 --> 06:56.843
Here.

07:20.501 --> 07:23.141
Do you even know
what you're playing?

07:26.974 --> 07:28.453
I miss mom.

07:29.610 --> 07:32.853
London is 8,857km away.

07:36.150 --> 07:38.152
Wanna go to London to see mom?

07:40.021 --> 07:41.523
Yup, totally.

07:44.192 --> 07:46.229
Should I ask your dad?

07:47.662 --> 07:49.073
They're divorced.

07:49.397 --> 07:52.344
He'll drink again
if you mention mom.

07:59.140 --> 08:00.175
That hurts!

08:02.977 --> 08:04.718
Things are heating up.

08:05.046 --> 08:07.356
You're hotter in China
than Japan.

08:08.516 --> 08:09.688
As expected.

08:10.284 --> 08:12.127
We should work on
Ms. Jo's series.

08:13.855 --> 08:15.266
You must be joking.

08:16.123 --> 08:19.866
I lied about doing her series
and got drafted the next day.

08:20.828 --> 08:22.762
You don't remember
that shitstorm?

08:22.763 --> 08:26.336
Of course I do,
you disappeared in her car.

08:28.603 --> 08:31.550
That was a PR nightmare...

08:32.073 --> 08:33.881
Why bring that shit up?

08:35.977 --> 08:37.888
Not interested, take it back.

08:39.380 --> 08:41.381
But it's a good project.

08:42.082 --> 08:44.927
It's about time
you return her favor.

08:45.152 --> 08:48.759
You wouldn't be
where you are without her.

08:50.124 --> 08:52.934
She's the one who owes me.

08:53.227 --> 08:55.207
It all worked out because of me.

08:56.464 --> 08:57.841
You did a tiny bit too.

09:00.201 --> 09:02.579
Kim Woo-bin is
scheduled for a film,

09:02.670 --> 09:05.514
and Roh Jin-woo's agent
is convincing him,

09:05.873 --> 09:07.375
but he's not interested.

09:07.975 --> 09:09.181
Roh Jin-woo?

09:11.245 --> 09:14.021
I explicitly told you
not to send it to him,

09:14.482 --> 09:15.893
are you deaf?

09:17.852 --> 09:20.196
Just wanted to
check his availability...

09:20.922 --> 09:25.393
People'll think it's no good
because Roh rejected it.

09:25.626 --> 09:27.469
I didn't ask you to do this!

09:27.562 --> 09:28.870
Come on!

09:28.996 --> 09:32.205
Who's gonna believe that?

09:32.400 --> 09:34.402
Forget it, alternative?

09:34.669 --> 09:36.945
Station chief is
pushing for Roh.

09:37.038 --> 09:40.281
Then change the station,
I don't like Roh.

09:43.477 --> 09:44.512
How is it?

09:46.280 --> 09:51.025
It's a brand new apartment,
and perfect for newlyweds.

09:51.619 --> 09:53.292
Since I owe you,

09:53.387 --> 09:56.766
I turned away a client
who wanted to sign.

09:56.891 --> 09:59.098
Yeah? I'd prefer
less commission though.

09:59.260 --> 10:02.002
Was the other client
a single woman?

10:02.096 --> 10:04.007
Yes, she was an older
single type too.

10:04.398 --> 10:06.844
I actually prefer single.

10:08.736 --> 10:11.080
Kids will doodle all over,

10:11.305 --> 10:13.046
those are silk wallpapers.

10:13.874 --> 10:17.981
He's not even married yet,
and the contract's for 2 years.

10:18.079 --> 10:19.846
Not like I'll rear
a prodigy artist.

10:19.847 --> 10:20.882
Of course not.

10:21.082 --> 10:23.984
Should we get through
the paperwork?

10:23.985 --> 10:25.225
Sure, let's do it.

10:25.453 --> 10:29.799
Stove and dishwasher's
built-in, so be careful.

10:29.890 --> 10:32.700
And don't hammer
any nails on the wall.

10:32.927 --> 10:35.601
Can you put all that
in the contract?

10:35.830 --> 10:38.003
Or I won't sign.

10:38.766 --> 10:40.507
Yeah, of course.

10:42.503 --> 10:45.739
Dang, she's really anal.

10:45.740 --> 10:47.845
Why did you bring up
old single woman?

10:48.075 --> 10:51.022
But it's the truth,
that's why she's single.

10:52.213 --> 10:55.023
Not an easy type
to live with, eh?

10:55.316 --> 10:56.624
I can hear you.

10:58.052 --> 11:01.056
Even the rudest people
can get married,

11:01.155 --> 11:03.658
I simply choose not to.

11:04.558 --> 11:06.731
I guess the walls
aren't soundproof.

11:06.927 --> 11:09.464
Bullcrap isn't soundproof.

11:09.664 --> 11:13.043
'Bullcrap isn't soundproof, '
she said,

11:13.701 --> 11:17.615
I kept my cool for that
damn apartment and signed.

11:20.007 --> 11:23.352
You said life is solitary,
but you're getting married.

11:23.577 --> 11:25.250
If I were you, I wouldn't.

11:25.579 --> 11:29.186
Why're you here?
I'd be in Gangnam.

11:29.450 --> 11:31.930
Chicks will dig you.

11:32.019 --> 11:34.431
Play piano at a bar, and say,

11:34.555 --> 11:36.660
'I wrote this, baby'.

11:37.158 --> 11:38.762
'Heard of Wind Sunny?'

11:38.859 --> 11:43.365
Then they'll go,
'Baby! Baby!'

11:43.698 --> 11:47.510
Can you swallow and talk?
I can't read your lips.

11:47.601 --> 11:49.308
Go make some girls wet.

11:49.570 --> 11:51.550
You're too cute to be wasted!

11:53.240 --> 11:55.413
Come on...

11:55.876 --> 11:57.219
Is it because of your hearing?

11:58.279 --> 12:00.225
You can still read lips.

12:00.314 --> 12:04.558
When you look at my lips,
my heart skips a beat.

12:04.652 --> 12:06.495
Chicks will go crazy.

12:06.587 --> 12:09.500
I can't look at a girl like that.

12:10.758 --> 12:14.171
Even with proper hearing,
I can't tell what girls say.

12:14.395 --> 12:16.602
Wait, aren't you
going to Jeju Island?

12:16.831 --> 12:21.246
Yeah, gotta check out
my friend's diner.

12:24.972 --> 12:26.474
Why didn't you tell me
he'd be here?

12:28.843 --> 12:30.151
Surprise!

12:31.212 --> 12:34.591
I'm moved that you came
when I said I was alone.

12:35.382 --> 12:38.488
Not even a call
after your discharge?

12:38.586 --> 12:41.795
You know I've been busy
with China and Japan.

12:42.456 --> 12:43.696
How have you been?

12:45.659 --> 12:46.831
Since you're here,

12:48.162 --> 12:51.609
let's hear why
you refused my series.

12:52.133 --> 12:54.841
There's only one reason
when an actor refuses,

12:55.903 --> 12:57.576
just not feeling it.

12:59.640 --> 13:02.746
You're a big shot now, huh?

13:03.911 --> 13:05.447
I am indeed quite big.

13:05.946 --> 13:07.254
I practically raised you.

13:07.348 --> 13:09.682
Too many people are saying that.

13:09.683 --> 13:11.424
I'm so sick of it!

13:11.619 --> 13:13.098
So grace means nothing?

13:13.454 --> 13:14.899
Were I to repay everyone,

13:15.356 --> 13:18.200
I'd have to star in every
Korean film and TV series.

13:18.425 --> 13:19.425
Good.

13:20.795 --> 13:22.240
That's the attitude.

13:22.630 --> 13:25.975
Don't be bound by loyalty,
only go after worthy work.

13:27.301 --> 13:30.009
Since you put it that way,
I feel better.

13:30.704 --> 13:31.774
I'm gonna go.

13:33.174 --> 13:35.120
What? Already?

13:35.209 --> 13:38.588
No point in drinking with
someone I won't work with.

13:43.951 --> 13:44.951
Bye.

13:46.854 --> 13:48.595
Still bossy as ever.

13:50.024 --> 13:51.867
As a drinking partner...

13:54.195 --> 13:57.335
she's amazing,
but as a creative partner,

13:58.399 --> 13:59.571
it's impossible.

14:01.402 --> 14:02.710
Listen, you chumps.

14:03.838 --> 14:07.581
When a man speaks his mind,
he's determined,

14:07.975 --> 14:10.012
but for a woman,
she's being bossy?

14:11.879 --> 14:13.654
Get with the times.

14:14.615 --> 14:16.060
Say it to her face!

14:20.120 --> 14:24.034
My life has already changed.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.870
I mustn't fall for
such cheesy line...

14:30.598 --> 14:33.306
So embarrassing.
I wish I could hide.

14:34.301 --> 14:35.746
Let's hide together.

14:36.837 --> 14:40.284
The Burberry Kiss scene,
'You're My Black Hole'

14:50.251 --> 14:51.628
Spring, it's dirty.

14:54.655 --> 14:56.532
15 Seconds Without Sorrow

14:56.924 --> 14:59.928
Carve your own path...
- Jo Kyung-ah

15:22.383 --> 15:23.521
Here's your water.

15:24.351 --> 15:25.853
Do you need anything else?

15:46.640 --> 15:48.745
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

15:48.876 --> 15:49.916
Do you need anything, sir?

15:50.110 --> 15:51.589
No, it's okay.

16:02.823 --> 16:04.123
May I help you?

16:04.124 --> 16:05.124
Yes.

16:06.427 --> 16:07.462
A blanket please.

16:08.562 --> 16:10.599
I'll bring it over.

16:13.968 --> 16:14.969
Excuse me?

16:15.669 --> 16:16.669
Excuse me?

16:17.237 --> 16:18.237
Excuse me?

16:19.139 --> 16:20.243
Excuse me?

16:21.208 --> 16:22.278
Excuse me?

16:23.010 --> 16:24.045
Excuse me!

16:26.914 --> 16:29.588
Newspaper please, every kind.

16:30.184 --> 16:32.596
Sure, one moment please.

16:32.753 --> 16:36.530
And a glass of ice water too.

16:37.324 --> 16:38.860
Aren't you cold?

16:38.959 --> 16:41.462
The blanket's very good,
it's super warm.

16:43.297 --> 16:44.105
Okay.

16:44.198 --> 16:46.542
Oh, just 3 ice cubes.

16:46.934 --> 16:49.278
Okay, absolutely!

16:49.536 --> 16:51.277
3 ice cubes!

16:54.742 --> 16:57.621
You never know
what's around the corner.

16:58.512 --> 17:02.483
Life's all about showing
who's the boss, right?

17:08.255 --> 17:12.067
What do you mean?
I deposited yesterday.

17:13.060 --> 17:16.530
There must be a mistake,
I'll call you back.

17:17.998 --> 17:19.340
What's going on?

17:19.900 --> 17:23.108
Ms. Landlady,
is something the matter?

17:24.905 --> 17:25.906
Honey!

17:28.474 --> 17:31.115
The number you've called
does not exist.

17:31.378 --> 17:34.325
Please check the number
and call again.

17:34.815 --> 17:36.158
What do you mean?

17:48.429 --> 17:51.672
I wasn't much of a lover to her,

17:52.599 --> 17:55.307
but why break it off
after I sign the lease?

18:01.141 --> 18:02.313
Good evening!

18:03.977 --> 18:05.285
What brings you?

18:06.980 --> 18:10.154
I'm never going to
fall in love again.'

18:10.417 --> 18:13.296
I saw your post and was worried.

18:14.088 --> 18:15.362
Are you okay?

18:17.391 --> 18:18.995
Not as sad as I thought.

18:19.660 --> 18:21.401
Know what's really sad?

18:21.728 --> 18:24.732
There're pricks
who 'Likes' posts like that.

18:26.366 --> 18:28.277
Boozing is the only answer.

18:28.836 --> 18:32.841
The agony of hangover
will overcome any grief,

18:33.107 --> 18:34.484
it's my life wisdom.

18:40.581 --> 18:44.552
Cheers to your grief
and my stress.

18:59.433 --> 19:04.007
I wish I could drink that
she-devil away too.

19:22.189 --> 19:23.190
Here.

19:32.966 --> 19:34.001
Su-ho.

19:36.136 --> 19:37.911
A woman must be kind.

19:39.039 --> 19:41.110
Appearance?
Boobs?

19:41.975 --> 19:43.386
Nothing matters.

19:44.811 --> 19:46.757
Ms. Jo said once,

19:47.414 --> 19:50.657
an older woman must
possess 1 of 2 things:

19:51.218 --> 19:53.164
competency, or tits.

19:54.288 --> 19:56.529
But she says she has both.

19:57.724 --> 19:58.862
What a bitch.

20:00.360 --> 20:02.067
Maybe I should get them done.

20:11.038 --> 20:13.018
What are you looking at?

20:13.106 --> 20:14.106
What?

20:16.577 --> 20:18.215
Were you looking at my tits?

20:20.347 --> 20:21.348
No...

20:25.018 --> 20:28.431
He's never had a girl,
stop teasing him.

20:31.625 --> 20:32.899
Never?

20:34.795 --> 20:36.206
You don't look it.

20:38.365 --> 20:41.000
Go with another actor.
- We can't.

20:41.001 --> 20:42.912
It has to be Roh Jin-woo.

20:43.003 --> 20:46.314
You can force someone
and expect great results.

20:46.673 --> 20:48.675
I've never worked like that!

20:50.077 --> 20:52.250
I'll get him back to the table,

20:52.546 --> 20:54.992
just say, 'let's do it'.

20:55.215 --> 20:56.558
I'll take care of the rest.

20:59.920 --> 21:02.161
Let me get married, please.

21:03.056 --> 21:04.797
Not again?!

21:14.835 --> 21:15.835
Let's do it.

21:20.407 --> 21:21.442
What?

21:26.947 --> 21:31.418
Are you still hung up
on our one-night stand?

21:31.852 --> 21:33.923
What are you talking about?

21:34.221 --> 21:35.427
It's nothing like that.

21:36.657 --> 21:39.331
- That must be it.
- Of course not!

21:42.462 --> 21:46.137
I got girls left and right,
why would I?

21:46.833 --> 21:50.280
It must be a fond memory,
for you I bet.

21:51.405 --> 21:52.679
Still live there?

21:53.106 --> 21:54.106
Yeah.

21:55.542 --> 21:59.649
I'm over it,
so let's work on this.

22:01.281 --> 22:03.989
You're too much...

22:08.388 --> 22:10.800
See? See? See?

22:11.625 --> 22:13.866
Why's a new building like this?!

22:14.027 --> 22:15.563
I should be saying that!

22:15.962 --> 22:19.910
The management will
seal the leak,

22:20.133 --> 22:21.771
so let's wait a while.

22:22.102 --> 22:24.548
Miss, I'm the one living here.

22:25.972 --> 22:27.713
Haven't moved in fully yet?

22:28.141 --> 22:29.552
When's the wedding?

22:32.045 --> 22:34.616
Why? Gonna send me
a wedding gift?

22:34.715 --> 22:35.989
Why should I?

22:36.316 --> 22:37.795
Then why bother asking?

22:37.918 --> 22:41.593
I wanted to know if this
could be fixed in time.

22:41.922 --> 22:46.166
You're so childish,
just like back on the plane.

22:46.259 --> 22:47.329
Childish?

22:48.995 --> 22:50.531
I don't believe this...

22:51.365 --> 22:55.177
You're being and lover a place
you bought with a loan!

22:55.369 --> 22:57.815
Look at this!
This place is a shithole!

22:59.306 --> 23:01.946
Are you just unlucky
or is this place cursed?

23:02.175 --> 23:05.452
It's been non-stop bad luck
after l moved in!

23:06.413 --> 23:07.448
Dammit!

23:13.854 --> 23:14.924
Are you crying?

23:21.294 --> 23:24.741
Hey, hey...

23:25.465 --> 23:28.639
I've been on the edge,
I didn't really mean that.

23:32.606 --> 23:34.608
I'm sorry, Okay?

23:35.475 --> 23:38.820
Please stop crying!
I should be the one crying!

23:41.214 --> 23:44.855
I only got this place
to get married,

23:45.318 --> 23:48.424
but my fiancee left me!

23:50.056 --> 23:51.296
Shit!

23:56.797 --> 23:58.197
So pitiful...

23:58.198 --> 23:58.938
What?

23:59.032 --> 24:03.276
I'm pitiful, and so are you...

24:05.739 --> 24:07.184
Thank you for understanding.

24:21.388 --> 24:23.629
Protein's best when
feeling empty, go on.

24:24.157 --> 24:25.295
Thank you.

24:29.863 --> 24:34.403
Why did you invest in
someone you don't know?

24:35.469 --> 24:37.278
Are you generous or naive?

24:37.971 --> 24:41.942
If the rate of return is good,
why'd he let a stranger in?

24:42.142 --> 24:43.143
Excuse me.

24:43.743 --> 24:46.053
Stick with either console
or lecture.

24:46.146 --> 24:49.218
Must you learn
by experience only?

24:49.649 --> 24:51.925
I'm glad we won't meet again.

24:52.219 --> 24:53.391
Likewise.

24:56.456 --> 24:58.094
So clumsy and dumb...

25:01.027 --> 25:02.597
No wonder he got the boot.

25:04.965 --> 25:06.308
At least he cooks well.

25:15.275 --> 25:18.017
If it's so bad,
why not sell this place?

25:18.111 --> 25:23.857
I bought this place
after paying off school loan.

25:24.384 --> 25:29.060
The mortgage is $200k,
but I can't just sell it.

25:30.056 --> 25:31.797
Then do whatever you want.

25:32.692 --> 25:36.162
Why are $500 rentals so lousy?

25:36.630 --> 25:39.406
I was excited to see
a large 2-bedroom rental,

25:39.633 --> 25:41.510
but I saw roaches!

25:45.705 --> 25:49.175
Not again...

25:50.143 --> 25:51.588
Here, take this.

26:01.087 --> 26:02.087
Then...

26:03.990 --> 26:07.995
pay me that rent,
I'll give you a room.

26:08.895 --> 26:09.896
What?

26:10.030 --> 26:14.342
Do I look like someone
who'll live with a random man?

26:14.834 --> 26:18.475
Forget it, I only wanted to
help my poor landlady.

26:18.572 --> 26:20.449
I prefer being alone!

26:25.412 --> 26:27.414
Staring at my tits one day,

26:28.181 --> 26:30.923
and not even a message
after mending me'?

26:35.221 --> 26:36.757
Is that Pyongyang noodles?

26:36.856 --> 26:40.167
It'd be perfect for
treating hangover.

26:43.663 --> 26:45.802
Yes, it's in Nonhyun district.

26:45.932 --> 26:47.843
I already knew, you idiot.

26:53.239 --> 26:55.583
Won't even invite me to coffee?

26:58.278 --> 26:59.484
Noodle lunch date?

26:59.980 --> 27:02.893
My office is nearby,
my treat if you come.

27:08.121 --> 27:10.533
Ah, I just had that
a moment ago...

27:13.627 --> 27:15.106
I already ate too.

27:15.662 --> 27:17.573
Just forget it.

27:22.369 --> 27:23.712
Take care

27:39.085 --> 27:40.085
Holy cow!

27:47.093 --> 27:48.327
- To the right, right.
- This way?

27:48.328 --> 27:49.705
The room at the end.

27:50.897 --> 27:52.103
Please be careful.

27:52.332 --> 27:55.745
Get out of the way!
You're not even gonna help!

27:55.969 --> 27:56.970
Be careful.

28:00.340 --> 28:02.183
She's really going overboard.

28:06.713 --> 28:09.387
Annoying, so annoying...

28:14.888 --> 28:16.799
Don't take offense.

28:17.190 --> 28:20.501
We barely know each other.

28:20.927 --> 28:23.601
Let's set some ground rules.

28:24.130 --> 28:26.542
Don't ever trespass my washroom.

28:27.333 --> 28:29.210
Wash dishes immediately.

28:29.703 --> 28:32.912
Take out recyclables immediately.

28:33.573 --> 28:35.416
That's what I wanted.

28:36.076 --> 28:38.716
Circumstances led me to move in,

28:39.112 --> 28:43.026
but I don't want people
to misunderstand...

28:43.817 --> 28:45.558
No one cares.

28:45.652 --> 28:48.633
Ladies around here
are extremely gossipy.

28:49.155 --> 28:51.431
And I get plenty of attention.

28:52.959 --> 28:55.269
Let's say we're siblings.

28:55.795 --> 28:57.502
Whatever you want.

29:08.408 --> 29:09.887
- Going somewhere?
- Hey.

29:10.110 --> 29:11.953
You looked deep in thought.

29:12.345 --> 29:13.346
Well...

29:14.614 --> 29:15.649
Dude...

29:16.416 --> 29:20.626
Some people are fated
to be together, right?

29:20.754 --> 29:21.754
What?

29:22.021 --> 29:27.903
Even without me really trying...

29:28.027 --> 29:30.007
I don't know what you mean,

29:30.897 --> 29:32.843
but sounds like you need to try.

29:33.333 --> 29:35.779
You should've asked for my help.

29:39.072 --> 29:43.248
May I cordially invite you
to noodles...

29:43.543 --> 29:46.490
That sounds too old fashioned...

29:46.579 --> 29:47.956
It's being formal.

29:48.748 --> 29:50.022
No juice left!

29:50.683 --> 29:51.683
What?!

29:53.153 --> 29:55.087
You sent it!
I don't believe it!

29:55.088 --> 29:57.790
Fate is bullshit,
just meet her for lunch.

29:57.791 --> 29:58.791
I'm off!

30:00.860 --> 30:02.032
Hey!

30:08.334 --> 30:09.335
Who is this?

30:15.141 --> 30:16.745
Maybe that was too harsh...

30:17.076 --> 30:18.555
Just kidding.

30:18.945 --> 30:22.154
If you come here,
I'll allow a coffee break.

30:26.586 --> 30:29.192
Was it really that difficult
asking me out to lunch?

30:30.323 --> 30:31.323
Yes.

30:33.359 --> 30:34.359
Why?

30:36.596 --> 30:37.734
I was nervous.

30:39.032 --> 30:40.443
Are you nervous now?

30:41.134 --> 30:42.135
Yes.

30:43.469 --> 30:47.918
I often hear that
I'm pretty attractive,

30:48.241 --> 30:52.690
but after your rejection,
I doubted myself.

30:52.779 --> 30:54.816
No, I mean...

30:55.582 --> 30:56.890
You really are attractive.

30:58.151 --> 30:59.721
Your eyes.

31:01.421 --> 31:02.559
Expression...

31:03.723 --> 31:06.203
is attractive too.

31:12.765 --> 31:13.800
Something on it...

31:16.936 --> 31:18.609
How's my voice?

31:21.307 --> 31:22.809
It's like ice cream.

31:23.877 --> 31:26.084
That's so cheesy!

31:26.512 --> 31:28.287
You'll be a big hit
as a lyricist.

31:28.915 --> 31:29.915
Well...

31:31.784 --> 31:32.718
Welcome!
- Congrats!

31:32.719 --> 31:33.993
Good to see you.

31:34.254 --> 31:36.063
Jin-woo's here too!

31:36.389 --> 31:38.232
You're a wedding addict!

31:38.591 --> 31:40.571
Thanks for always coming.

31:40.793 --> 31:41.897
Congrats is in order.

31:41.995 --> 31:44.908
Jin-woo, let's work together.

31:45.431 --> 31:48.435
No biz talk on your wedding.
Greet your guests.

31:49.269 --> 31:50.646
Help me just this once.

31:54.207 --> 31:56.187
This is my agency's
newest actress.

31:56.542 --> 31:57.776
She's really great.

31:57.777 --> 31:59.779
Ms. Jo, I'm a huge fan.

31:59.913 --> 32:00.948
Good to meet you.

32:01.481 --> 32:03.518
Her figure isn't bad.

32:05.752 --> 32:06.752
Whoa!

32:07.553 --> 32:08.553
Mommy...

32:08.922 --> 32:10.230
You're so cute!

32:11.524 --> 32:12.658
Where's your mom?

32:12.659 --> 32:14.195
Mommy!

32:18.598 --> 32:19.633
Don't cry.

32:21.601 --> 32:22.909
- It's okay.
- Hey!

32:23.169 --> 32:24.273
What are you doing?

32:24.604 --> 32:26.106
You made him cry?

32:27.173 --> 32:28.277
It's okay, Spring.

32:29.409 --> 32:31.787
Mommy! Mommy!

32:35.481 --> 32:37.586
It's not like I committed a sin.

32:38.284 --> 32:40.355
Why is she up my butt?

32:41.054 --> 32:43.398
Is she getting back at me?

32:43.957 --> 32:45.698
That's her kid.

32:46.492 --> 32:48.802
She's married?
That's her kid?

32:49.963 --> 32:51.806
She's a single mom,
there's no dad.

32:53.132 --> 32:55.134
Come here, I'll tell you.

32:57.637 --> 32:59.082
How old was he?

33:00.039 --> 33:01.677
You got drafted in the spring.

33:02.241 --> 33:03.743
He was born in the winter,

33:04.277 --> 33:05.779
so about 3 years old.

33:22.662 --> 33:24.972
Not even close.

33:34.540 --> 33:37.885
This tiny speck is
already a year old!

34:02.668 --> 34:09.552
3 years ago

34:11.077 --> 34:13.580
- Whoa!
- My stomach!

34:13.913 --> 34:15.152
Hey!
Ow!

34:15.248 --> 34:16.248
Why are you here?!

34:16.416 --> 34:17.656
I should be asking you that...

34:18.518 --> 34:19.757
It's my car!

34:20.018 --> 34:21.429
What're you talki...

34:23.856 --> 34:25.358
That son of a bitch!

34:26.626 --> 34:27.866
Where's your manager?

34:29.896 --> 34:30.931
What's wrong?

34:31.630 --> 34:33.440
I gotta poop...

34:33.632 --> 34:36.079
So nasty!
Get the hell out!

34:36.168 --> 34:37.670
I'm gonna shut the gate!

34:38.004 --> 34:39.244
Hey! Hey!

34:39.472 --> 34:40.472
It's coming!

34:43.976 --> 34:45.353
That feels so good.

34:48.648 --> 34:49.922
You're a piece of work.

34:50.983 --> 34:52.656
I'm gonna post it
all over the web.

34:54.120 --> 34:55.463
You're being too hard.

34:56.188 --> 34:59.432
I'm leaving for
military service tomorrow.

34:59.959 --> 35:01.870
- It's tomorrow?
- Yes.

35:03.563 --> 35:05.372
Be safe then.

35:09.302 --> 35:10.406
Want some water?

35:14.140 --> 35:15.244
How about beer?

35:16.375 --> 35:19.049
This 17-year old
isn't quite good.

35:19.312 --> 35:20.848
Drink what you're given.

35:21.214 --> 35:23.524
You were never a connoisseur.

35:23.883 --> 35:26.989
Remember that pork skin place...

35:27.520 --> 35:30.091
Still gloating over paying
the tab a few times?

35:30.656 --> 35:33.694
I drink soju,
and hard stuff too.

35:34.026 --> 35:37.337
Depending on the mood...
You're so petty.

35:38.598 --> 35:42.740
So you remember,
I thought you forgot.

35:43.569 --> 35:45.571
Don't do that.

35:46.038 --> 35:48.109
No need to get worked up!

35:49.909 --> 35:53.049
I hope the military
curve that attitude...

35:53.246 --> 35:54.748
I said stop that!

35:58.084 --> 36:00.564
Because you're cute!
That hurts!

36:01.654 --> 36:02.792
I'm cute?

36:06.092 --> 36:07.093
Really?

36:10.296 --> 36:11.639
Will you still feel
the same way?

36:19.172 --> 36:20.172
Well now...

36:30.149 --> 36:31.560
Don't regret this.

36:33.819 --> 36:34.957
Don't pretend to be bossy.

37:02.949 --> 37:04.451
- Is it a boy?
- What?

37:05.384 --> 37:07.625
No, you got it all wrong.

37:08.287 --> 37:09.664
For a relative, of course.

37:10.556 --> 37:13.225
Sure, but gender I mean.

37:13.226 --> 37:15.365
Boy or girl, which one?

37:16.395 --> 37:18.534
I'm a big fan, Mr. Roh.

37:21.567 --> 37:24.571
He's a boy, a nephew.

37:40.486 --> 37:42.989
A strange man?
At my front door?

37:44.557 --> 37:45.592
Okay.

37:54.367 --> 37:55.846
What's he doing?

37:56.202 --> 37:57.704
I was in the neighborhood.

37:59.405 --> 38:00.405
No...

38:01.707 --> 38:06.011
I felt sorry for the kid,
back at the wedding...

38:06.012 --> 38:07.012
Hey!

38:07.680 --> 38:09.682
Go play somewhere else.

38:10.082 --> 38:12.289
Wait! I gotta use
your washroom!

38:15.588 --> 38:17.659
Some things never change.

38:22.595 --> 38:23.835
It's all right.

38:24.196 --> 38:27.040
When did you have
the time to have a child?

38:28.000 --> 38:31.243
Your Facebook is
plastered with his photos.

38:31.504 --> 38:32.915
Were you lurking my page?

38:33.172 --> 38:35.152
Why the heck would I?!

38:35.641 --> 38:38.121
I got tens of
thousands of friends!

38:39.412 --> 38:42.689
I saw my manager
checking it out.

38:43.349 --> 38:45.590
Sorry he's too loud, it's okay.

38:45.685 --> 38:47.289
You're not even married...

38:48.988 --> 38:51.696
Oh, sperm bank!

38:54.026 --> 38:58.236
You're a banguard in
all aspects of life.

39:00.433 --> 39:03.175
A vanguard, you mean.

39:05.805 --> 39:08.012
It's a difficult word.

39:11.410 --> 39:14.687
What exactly happened
in the past 3 years?

39:15.381 --> 39:17.361
Don't beat around the bush.

39:17.717 --> 39:19.890
He's not yours, so just leave.

39:20.219 --> 39:22.495
So who's the father?!

39:22.588 --> 39:24.795
Why is that any of
your business?

39:27.526 --> 39:28.266
Get out.

39:28.427 --> 39:29.906
I'll do your series
if you tell me.

40:00.760 --> 40:01.760
Jesus!

40:03.129 --> 40:04.631
You startled me!

40:04.764 --> 40:07.608
Look, when will you
toss those boxes?

40:07.700 --> 40:09.839
There are more in the balcony.

40:10.736 --> 40:13.410
By the way, are you losing hair?

40:14.340 --> 40:16.752
Just look at that!

40:16.842 --> 40:20.153
I'll clean it up
after drying my hair.

40:20.379 --> 40:21.379
Happy?!

40:30.156 --> 40:31.601
So anal...

40:36.429 --> 40:38.602
You don't have to wait with me.

40:38.931 --> 40:42.401
Does staking out guarantee that

40:42.935 --> 40:45.108
he'll take the part?

40:46.138 --> 40:49.676
Of course not.
I'm doing what I can.

40:53.012 --> 40:54.012
Right.

40:55.080 --> 40:56.320
This mirror's off...

41:02.254 --> 41:04.962
So warm...

41:08.060 --> 41:09.869
We need music
at a moment like this.

41:13.098 --> 41:15.237
Su-ho, you know this song?

41:17.870 --> 41:19.543
Well...

41:20.973 --> 41:22.953
Sounds familiar.

41:24.343 --> 41:26.414
This song is everywhere now.

41:26.512 --> 41:28.287
Aren't you working
to be a songwriter?

41:29.248 --> 41:31.319
This is Wind Sunny.

41:31.884 --> 41:35.627
I wanted them for our OST,
so I contacted them.

41:40.292 --> 41:43.432
You must really like Wind Sunny.

41:44.063 --> 41:45.235
I love them.

41:45.464 --> 41:49.571
Great melody
but lyrics are lacking.

41:51.237 --> 41:54.275
It feels like he never
confessed properly,

41:54.573 --> 41:57.281
but sings about pain
that is not real.

41:58.844 --> 41:59.879
You're right.

42:01.480 --> 42:02.584
Sounds about right.

42:07.786 --> 42:09.527
What kind of music do you write?

42:11.290 --> 42:13.133
Inn-

42:14.059 --> 42:17.302
I'm still learning
different types.

42:17.796 --> 42:19.867
I want to hear
something you wrote.

42:21.400 --> 42:23.311
Could I hear it
when you're done?

42:26.105 --> 42:27.175
Sure.

42:34.947 --> 42:37.518
Bok-su's getting
meat for breakfast.

42:37.883 --> 42:40.090
- Bok-su?
- He lives with me.

42:45.257 --> 42:46.668
He's also a dog.

42:50.596 --> 42:52.007
But the name is so...

42:52.264 --> 42:53.743
Don't make fun.

42:54.833 --> 42:56.473
Did you see the series
'Do As You Please'?

42:56.535 --> 42:59.379
- Ko Bok-su from that?
- Yup.

42:59.705 --> 43:01.776
My dog's name is
Kyung from that series.

43:01.907 --> 43:03.011
Come on...

43:04.310 --> 43:06.945
I even got a photo
from visiting the set.

43:06.946 --> 43:07.979
I'll show it to you later.

43:07.980 --> 43:09.459
Me too!

43:09.848 --> 43:11.759
We may've met on the set.

43:12.151 --> 43:13.425
Did you go to Homigot too?

43:13.852 --> 43:17.823
Yes! It was my first time there.

43:19.391 --> 43:20.768
I want to see the ocean...

43:21.794 --> 43:23.034
Shall we go now?

43:24.063 --> 43:25.371
I got work tomorrow.

43:27.232 --> 43:28.575
Another time?

43:33.272 --> 43:34.272
For sure.

43:52.925 --> 43:53.925
You!

43:54.760 --> 43:55.966
You live upstairs!

44:00.532 --> 44:01.567
EJ...

44:03.068 --> 44:05.014
Remember him?
My son.

44:10.209 --> 44:11.244
EJ is young.

44:12.978 --> 44:14.252
That's probably why...

44:16.615 --> 44:20.825
he's bothering you
to look for his mom.

44:23.255 --> 44:27.203
There's a big secret
that he won't understand,

44:29.828 --> 44:33.469
so please let him be
until I'm ready to tell him.

44:33.832 --> 44:35.743
- What secret?
- Who was that?

44:38.470 --> 44:39.608
Ghost?

44:40.039 --> 44:41.950
Did you hear that?
Oh yeah, you can't...

44:42.374 --> 44:43.375
The secret.

44:45.277 --> 44:48.622
Why did you play dumb
when you can read lips?

44:50.983 --> 44:53.088
I was fooling around at first,

44:53.619 --> 44:56.293
but it was cute when
EJ came over to chat.

44:56.689 --> 44:59.568
Thank you, for being his friend.

45:01.927 --> 45:05.033
No, he's the one
being my friend.

45:07.232 --> 45:09.974
By the way, what's wrong with...

45:12.104 --> 45:14.050
Were you born deaf?

45:15.207 --> 45:16.242
No.

45:17.676 --> 45:19.986
I was in an accident
in high school.

45:20.746 --> 45:23.750
Something must've
gone wrong then...

45:37.296 --> 45:39.173
My dream was to
become a pianist.

45:41.166 --> 45:45.137
But when I went deaf,
I just wanted to die.

45:47.740 --> 45:50.516
Because I love music,

45:51.643 --> 45:56.422
I played the rhythms,
beats, melodies,

45:56.915 --> 45:59.395
whatever I could remember
over and over again.

46:00.719 --> 46:02.221
My mother said to me,

46:03.889 --> 46:05.990
play piano with your heart.

46:05.991 --> 46:09.666
She's a real artist.

46:10.763 --> 46:11.763
She is.

46:12.297 --> 46:14.038
She helped me tremendously.

46:14.433 --> 46:15.878
Taught me to speak properly.

46:16.568 --> 46:22.644
While learning to read lips,
I practiced with her.

46:22.741 --> 46:25.051
You fooled me completely.

46:31.550 --> 46:33.461
That smells amazing!

46:33.585 --> 46:34.585
Look here!

46:37.623 --> 46:38.624
What's with you?

46:39.324 --> 46:43.101
It's my body wash,
did you use my bath?

46:44.062 --> 46:45.234
No...

46:46.098 --> 46:48.044
Body washes are dime a dozen.

46:48.367 --> 46:50.847
It's a French brand
you can't buy here!

46:54.339 --> 46:56.580
I really didn't mean to,

46:56.675 --> 47:00.745
but I went to yours to
compare water pressure,

47:00.746 --> 47:02.953
and yours was really good,

47:04.116 --> 47:05.595
so I took a quick shower!

47:05.684 --> 47:07.994
Change my showerhead,
you're the landlady!

47:08.353 --> 47:11.088
A quick shower?
You used my sponge,

47:11.089 --> 47:13.365
all over your body!

47:13.725 --> 47:15.068
How'd you feel?!

47:15.727 --> 47:19.300
I'm sorry,
I'll buy you a new one.

47:21.433 --> 47:22.741
So annoying!

47:23.402 --> 47:25.780
I get stress from
manager at work,

47:26.238 --> 47:28.775
and from annoying
roommate at home!

47:29.241 --> 47:32.450
No need to let
your anger blind you.

47:32.845 --> 47:34.256
Here, here.

47:37.583 --> 47:38.721
I'm on a diet.

47:39.585 --> 47:40.859
Say what?

47:41.086 --> 47:42.292
But you're so fit!

47:42.387 --> 47:44.799
Gonna quit and become
a super model?

47:46.191 --> 47:47.829
I'm not that fit.

47:49.795 --> 47:51.035
She's falling for it.

47:51.630 --> 47:52.630
What?

47:52.664 --> 47:54.439
Sit and try it.

47:54.900 --> 47:56.402
Come on, sit down.

48:00.772 --> 48:01.772
Here.

48:04.543 --> 48:08.150
Eat this and forget
all about your stress.

48:11.049 --> 48:15.395
The young ones kiss butt
and get promoted easily.

48:16.088 --> 48:19.297
What's the matter?
I'm versed in office politics.

48:19.391 --> 48:20.529
Like a know-it-all.

48:20.626 --> 48:23.294
Don't make fun,
I'm here to help.

48:23.295 --> 48:26.003
I'm really good at
pandering to my patrons.

48:26.231 --> 48:27.710
Must I really do that?

48:27.799 --> 48:29.574
Can't I just do my work?

48:29.668 --> 48:31.443
Pandering is a must.

48:31.870 --> 48:34.976
Mortgage payments, rent,
and all the stuff you buy,

48:35.073 --> 48:37.178
you need a salary bump.

48:37.242 --> 48:39.449
No good comes from
being on her bad side.

48:42.347 --> 48:44.827
What does she like?

48:45.484 --> 48:47.760
Drinking and... singing?

48:48.120 --> 48:50.532
Okay, karaoke at company dinner.

48:51.156 --> 48:52.499
What do you like to sing?

48:52.624 --> 48:53.659
'A Doll's Dream'.

48:53.892 --> 48:56.065
Dang it, I knew it.

48:56.261 --> 48:58.537
That's for when you
go with a guy!

48:58.730 --> 49:02.769
Dignity, elegance, emotion
come after your promotion!

49:02.834 --> 49:04.677
And only then!

49:06.071 --> 49:10.019
You must lose yourself,
completely and utterly.

49:10.409 --> 49:12.446
'I'll be your slave
with bells and whistles.'

49:12.577 --> 49:15.285
Ring, ring, ring!

49:15.714 --> 49:18.160
Be different and impressionable!

49:18.617 --> 49:22.394
Our manager is the best!
She's the greatest!

49:22.854 --> 49:24.891
They're hilarious!

49:30.996 --> 49:33.340
I'll be your slave
with bells and whistles.

49:33.565 --> 49:34.298
Ring, ring!

49:34.299 --> 49:36.472
Be different and impressionable!

50:11.703 --> 50:13.512
I've never seen her like that!

50:14.406 --> 50:16.283
She must be so desperate...

50:16.742 --> 50:20.349
Oh yeah, didn't you say
you're quitting?

50:20.579 --> 50:21.717
Is this your farewell show?

50:21.980 --> 50:24.722
No, no, this is
only the beginning!

50:25.417 --> 50:26.555
Awesome!

50:28.920 --> 50:32.834
I don't want to sell
duty free stuff anymore.

50:33.158 --> 50:34.432
My knees are achy!

50:35.360 --> 50:37.499
Upgrade to business class!

50:39.664 --> 50:41.337
Ju-ran, I...

50:42.200 --> 50:44.874
You got a hubby to feed,
just go.

50:45.437 --> 50:47.314
Give me some water though.

50:57.816 --> 50:59.193
Why here?

50:59.484 --> 51:01.589
My regular patron
is an intern here.

51:02.054 --> 51:03.054
Let's go.

51:10.262 --> 51:11.570
Come on, let's go.

51:24.776 --> 51:26.084
What seems to be the problem?

51:26.611 --> 51:28.557
Neck, neck.
Her neck's the problem.

51:30.982 --> 51:32.393
Could you remove your scarf?

51:46.631 --> 51:47.939
Scalpel... Wait.

51:48.633 --> 51:50.078
We need a specialist.

51:51.136 --> 51:52.136
Wait!

51:52.604 --> 51:54.447
Don't kill me! Please!

51:54.606 --> 51:56.483
Here we go.

51:58.043 --> 52:00.353
I want to live!

52:04.049 --> 52:06.222
Nothing's ever going my way.

52:07.185 --> 52:10.598
I thought I'd be running
my business by now.

52:11.756 --> 52:14.032
So embarrassing...

52:24.803 --> 52:25.803
Here.

52:29.541 --> 52:33.079
People forget
others' affairs quickly.

52:37.849 --> 52:42.229
Dammit, got another white hair.

52:44.990 --> 52:47.698
I really hate getting old!

52:48.627 --> 52:51.870
I don't have any more
unwed friends.

52:52.631 --> 52:55.942
I'll watch their kids grow up
and hit 40.

52:56.034 --> 53:00.176
40 is today's 30,
nothing's wrong with 40.

53:01.640 --> 53:04.708
Would you marry
a 40-year old woman?

53:04.709 --> 53:05.551
Never.

53:05.677 --> 53:07.714
See? See?

53:07.979 --> 53:12.155
All men are the same,
we all age!

53:14.152 --> 53:17.395
Some men actually prefer
older women.

53:17.589 --> 53:21.036
Remember Min-ho?
He's one of them.

53:21.993 --> 53:22.993
Who?

53:24.296 --> 53:26.037
- The intern?
- Yeah.

53:26.264 --> 53:27.264
Are you two close?

53:27.632 --> 53:29.839
He's a regular,
and a Facebook friend.

53:30.302 --> 53:31.303
He was cute.

53:32.504 --> 53:34.108
Should I set you up?

53:34.506 --> 53:37.248
I'm not into that.

53:37.776 --> 53:40.950
Call him when I drop by
for a drink.

53:41.746 --> 53:42.952
Organically.

53:43.215 --> 53:46.662
Even during that debacle,
you saw how cute he was?

53:47.152 --> 53:48.631
20/20, 20/20.

53:51.456 --> 53:53.094
Namsan Tower

53:55.126 --> 53:59.074
Go somewhere like
Namsan after this?

54:00.065 --> 54:03.410
No, no one goes there
on dates anymore.

54:04.402 --> 54:06.382
Let's do something
you really want to do.

54:09.641 --> 54:13.282
It might be scary...

54:13.678 --> 54:16.352
Eating pasta on every date
is scarier.

54:17.916 --> 54:18.916
Holy crap...

54:19.851 --> 54:21.455
You wanted to do this?

54:24.122 --> 54:27.626
I've been meaning to.

54:27.892 --> 54:28.892
Why?

54:29.928 --> 54:31.669
Because I might hear it.

54:31.830 --> 54:32.900
Hear what?

55:09.301 --> 55:10.905
Can't take your eyes off of me?

55:12.570 --> 55:13.571
Well...

55:14.973 --> 55:17.977
I do get prettier over time.

55:18.576 --> 55:19.576
Totally.

55:24.949 --> 55:26.087
Would you like to listen?

55:28.720 --> 55:30.256
Is it your song?

55:31.756 --> 55:32.756
Yes.

55:47.672 --> 55:49.583
Wow, it's great.

55:52.177 --> 55:53.815
It's too good
to listen to alone.

55:55.213 --> 55:56.521
But I want it for myself.

55:59.451 --> 56:02.660
Write the lyrics too.
Okay?

56:04.155 --> 56:05.155
Okay.

56:18.737 --> 56:22.810
But it's my day off!
I have to sleep!

56:23.908 --> 56:26.210
Why drive over an hour
for photos?

56:26.211 --> 56:28.088
You gotta trust me on this!

56:28.346 --> 56:29.848
What a load of crap...

56:30.348 --> 56:32.692
I came up with
an elaborate plan.

56:32.884 --> 56:35.160
A plan to lure Dr. Min-ho.

56:35.420 --> 56:37.229
Since he and I are
Facebook friends,

56:37.322 --> 56:40.769
I can tell he's
extremely active on it.

56:41.226 --> 56:46.266
So we must add some class
to your page.

56:46.364 --> 56:50.676
Then, unite on Facebook,
we are the world!

56:54.572 --> 56:57.382
He's getting hotter by the day.

56:59.144 --> 57:00.521
So hot...

57:01.679 --> 57:05.286
Listen, Roh is so much
younger than you.

57:05.483 --> 57:07.895
Doesn't make him any less hot.

57:07.986 --> 57:10.057
TV's the problem.

57:10.155 --> 57:13.023
In reality, boys don't
chase after cougars.

57:13.024 --> 57:18.531
The writers' fantasies are
having bad influence on women.

57:28.239 --> 57:29.239
Jo Spring!

57:29.441 --> 57:30.647
Feels good to be out?

57:33.077 --> 57:36.752
Peace and calm may be
few and far between.

57:37.882 --> 57:39.327
Thanks to that bastard.

57:45.457 --> 57:46.492
Change Post Privacy

57:47.725 --> 57:49.500
Friends Only

57:52.096 --> 57:54.235
You're adorable!

57:54.599 --> 57:56.442
Honk!
- Honk!

58:00.004 --> 58:01.483
Doesn't he look familiar?

58:02.073 --> 58:03.916
You know, that actor.

58:04.242 --> 58:07.655
What are you talking about?
What actor?

58:08.079 --> 58:10.081
He only looks like
his mom, right?

58:10.315 --> 58:12.090
Mommy, mommy.

58:13.318 --> 58:15.752
Don't play with strange women.

58:15.753 --> 58:16.788
Walk away.

58:17.088 --> 58:18.088
'Strange woman'?

58:19.591 --> 58:22.936
What's wrong with her?
I was complimenting.

58:23.027 --> 58:24.734
Maybe she fought
with her husband.

58:26.130 --> 58:27.165
What a weirdo.

58:30.835 --> 58:32.143
Turn your head a bit.

58:32.504 --> 58:34.071
You look old head on.

58:34.072 --> 58:35.072
Hey!

58:38.510 --> 58:39.510
Stop!

58:39.878 --> 58:42.415
Yeah, that looked sexy,
turn right 45 degrees.

58:44.749 --> 58:45.955
Very good.

58:48.019 --> 58:49.019
That's it.

58:50.221 --> 58:51.021
Updating Profile Photo

58:51.022 --> 58:53.935
Now, add me as a friend,
and start commenting,

58:53.992 --> 58:55.403
then we wait.

58:55.460 --> 58:57.838
Even with some pretty photos,

58:57.962 --> 59:00.909
he won't forget the ER incident.

59:01.966 --> 59:03.274
Ms. Ju-ran.

59:03.968 --> 59:07.677
You're a cabin crew,
every man's fantasy.

59:07.972 --> 59:09.383
Stewardess!

59:11.476 --> 59:12.546
Fantasy?

59:17.115 --> 59:19.026
She locked her page?

59:21.553 --> 59:23.226
She's a prima donna.

59:23.488 --> 59:24.558
Forget it, forget it.

59:31.429 --> 59:32.874
Must a celebrity

59:33.565 --> 59:36.239
send Friend Request
to a regular folk?

59:38.102 --> 59:40.173
Forget it, forget it!

59:41.039 --> 59:42.712
A TV writer is a public figure too.

59:43.508 --> 59:44.508
Sure.

59:45.677 --> 59:47.122
A pseudo-celeb.

59:51.416 --> 59:53.623
We go way back, for sure.

59:56.788 --> 59:58.131
A writer and an actor.

01:00:07.632 --> 01:00:08.872
Friend Requests

01:00:09.133 --> 01:00:10.806
Roh Jin-woo

01:00:11.269 --> 01:00:12.805
Remove

01:00:13.538 --> 01:00:14.608
Fat chance.

01:00:15.173 --> 01:00:19.019
Imagine a woman enjoying
culture on her free time.

01:00:19.677 --> 01:00:20.917
We're not seeing the exhibit?

01:00:21.379 --> 01:00:22.379
What for?

01:00:22.547 --> 01:00:24.720
We got the photo,
what else is there?

01:00:25.183 --> 01:00:26.685
Let's go eat!

01:00:28.886 --> 01:00:30.923
You're a Facebook con artist.

01:00:31.623 --> 01:00:32.897
Relationship is a con.

01:00:33.157 --> 01:00:37.606
Showing what he wants
is winning that con.

01:00:37.762 --> 01:00:38.762
Nothing else to it.

01:00:39.697 --> 01:00:41.142
This is it.

01:00:41.933 --> 01:00:43.867
Can we just go home now?

01:00:43.868 --> 01:00:46.246
He posts poetry often
on his page.

01:00:46.337 --> 01:00:47.337
Look, look.

01:00:47.372 --> 01:00:49.613
- Not poetry...
- That's good.

01:00:51.976 --> 01:00:53.176
This looks too fake...

01:00:53.177 --> 01:00:55.054
Let's go POV.

01:00:55.146 --> 01:00:57.956
Your finger, yeah that's good.

01:01:00.918 --> 01:01:04.092
Why is he into hiking?

01:01:04.188 --> 01:01:05.531
How should I know?

01:01:06.157 --> 01:01:08.967
Almost there, come on.

01:01:09.994 --> 01:01:10.927
I can't...

01:01:10.928 --> 01:01:12.635
We're almost there!

01:01:14.599 --> 01:01:17.910
I can't, no more!

01:01:22.206 --> 01:01:24.413
You look fine,
stand up straight.

01:01:24.709 --> 01:01:26.450
- Hooray!
- That's too plain!

01:01:27.311 --> 01:01:30.690
No stupid pose, something good.

01:01:32.717 --> 01:01:35.960
That's too tacky,
something trendy.

01:01:37.355 --> 01:01:38.561
What the hell?

01:01:39.624 --> 01:01:40.796
Then what?

01:01:40.858 --> 01:01:43.862
I almost swore,
it was on my tongue.

01:01:44.996 --> 01:01:46.339
Will this work?

01:01:48.566 --> 01:01:49.670
Where's that photo?

01:01:49.767 --> 01:01:50.801
Oh, here.

01:01:50.802 --> 01:01:52.372
Post

01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:54.571
Kids love me for some reason...

01:01:54.572 --> 01:01:56.882
A warm woman with
maternal instinct.

01:01:57.008 --> 01:01:58.146
Awesome.

01:02:00.144 --> 01:02:01.521
You're a pro.

01:02:01.612 --> 01:02:04.548
Now, a hint of loneliness.

01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:07.291
Looks so lonely.
That flower, and my feet too...

01:02:12.457 --> 01:02:13.902
You got a message.

01:02:18.963 --> 01:02:21.637
It's your girl?
Must be nice.

01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:23.438
Are you busy today?

01:02:23.901 --> 01:02:29.112
My friends want to see
your cute face in person.

01:02:31.042 --> 01:02:32.783
Wanna join us?

01:02:33.578 --> 01:02:35.216
Why message him
instead of calling?

01:02:36.247 --> 01:02:39.091
He rarely answers my calls
for some reason.

01:02:39.517 --> 01:02:40.928
But texting's no problem.

01:02:41.185 --> 01:02:44.132
It's too last minute,
so he might not come.

01:02:44.622 --> 01:02:46.727
No reply yet?

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:50.571
He's not coming.

01:02:50.895 --> 01:02:53.876
You really believe that
he's working?

01:02:55.166 --> 01:02:58.477
Maybe he's married.
Using Facebook for affairs.

01:02:58.569 --> 01:03:01.379
- Right?
- You wanna die?

01:03:01.639 --> 01:03:02.640
No.

01:03:03.007 --> 01:03:04.008
It's nothing like that.

01:03:24.228 --> 01:03:25.901
Oh, hey!

01:03:26.464 --> 01:03:28.410
So you're Kyung.

01:03:28.766 --> 01:03:31.076
Bok-su's at my place.

01:03:31.769 --> 01:03:35.046
I'm sorry I didn't come,
not even a reply too.

01:03:35.139 --> 01:03:38.348
No, dinner like that
could be uncomfortable.

01:03:40.778 --> 01:03:45.090
I'm not good at
mingling with people.

01:03:46.017 --> 01:03:47.519
I'm not proud of that...

01:03:48.452 --> 01:03:51.399
but I can't seem to fix it...

01:03:51.722 --> 01:03:56.899
Feels like I'm moving
our relationship too quickly.

01:03:57.929 --> 01:04:01.741
We barely get to meet,
and you don't answer my calls.

01:04:03.167 --> 01:04:04.976
You'll only get busier,

01:04:05.403 --> 01:04:09.681
and if we keep this up,
it'll be a torture for me.

01:04:11.676 --> 01:04:14.987
So I came here
to break things off.

01:04:17.615 --> 01:04:19.822
Even now, it feels like
I'm bothering you.

01:04:25.156 --> 01:04:27.227
I'm sorry, I'll leave you alone.

01:04:36.801 --> 01:04:38.007
Give me one minute.

01:06:28.846 --> 01:06:31.258
Na-yun, I'm sorry.

01:06:32.350 --> 01:06:36.264
I really do like you.

01:06:39.457 --> 01:06:41.061
To be honest...

01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:07.588
So, practice does work.

01:07:17.228 --> 01:07:21.142
How did you know
I just washed up?

01:07:21.232 --> 01:07:24.679
I wanted to see
your face and chat.

01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:28.007
It hasn't been that long.

01:07:29.306 --> 01:07:30.614
How do I look on the screen?

01:07:32.276 --> 01:07:35.280
You look...
better in person.

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:38.489
It's because
the make-up's gone.

01:07:39.884 --> 01:07:41.227
I'm kidding.

01:07:41.619 --> 01:07:44.532
You're always pretty.

01:07:46.257 --> 01:07:47.668
This is Bok-su.

01:07:48.059 --> 01:07:49.059
Say hi.

01:07:50.227 --> 01:07:52.298
Say hi to Kyung.
Hi!

01:07:55.733 --> 01:07:59.180
Got time this weekend?
Let's go see a play.

01:07:59.270 --> 01:08:00.510
Play?

01:08:01.939 --> 01:08:03.475
Don't like plays?

01:08:04.141 --> 01:08:06.087
[An actor] know is starring.

01:08:06.811 --> 01:08:08.078
Or I'll go on my own.

01:08:08.079 --> 01:08:10.650
No, it's not that,
I've never seen one.

01:08:18.389 --> 01:08:21.096
I never got to say this to you,

01:08:21.692 --> 01:08:24.536
but I can't hear very well.

01:08:26.497 --> 01:08:28.807
I didn't mean to
keep this from you...

01:08:30.267 --> 01:08:34.716
I realized that liking someone
is a good thing.

01:08:35.439 --> 01:08:36.611
Thanks to you.

01:08:38.442 --> 01:08:43.551
It's late, but I wanted to
tell you everything.

01:08:44.381 --> 01:08:45.587
Reply

01:08:58.129 --> 01:08:59.801
Why won't you accept
my Friend Request?

01:08:59.964 --> 01:09:00.999
Holy cow!

01:09:02.466 --> 01:09:04.810
Really? I didn't notice.

01:09:09.439 --> 01:09:12.319
What's the big deal
about friending me?

01:09:13.410 --> 01:09:15.185
Is that why you came here?

01:09:16.613 --> 01:09:18.354
I was walking through.

01:09:19.450 --> 01:09:20.587
Then keep walking.

01:09:21.551 --> 01:09:22.551
Mommy.

01:09:26.290 --> 01:09:28.327
So cute!

01:09:31.862 --> 01:09:33.773
And handsome too!

01:09:34.098 --> 01:09:35.372
Who's your daddy?

01:09:36.033 --> 01:09:37.444
Who's the dad?

01:09:39.537 --> 01:09:41.278
Don't ask me that
in front of him.

01:09:41.671 --> 01:09:44.413
Quit Facebook,
you're a ticking PR disaster.

01:09:44.808 --> 01:09:47.220
I said I'll do your series
if you tell me.

01:09:47.611 --> 01:09:49.488
Why are you curious?

01:09:49.613 --> 01:09:52.389
I told you before,
he's not yours.

01:09:54.251 --> 01:09:56.857
You need me for your comeback.

01:09:57.922 --> 01:09:59.731
I don't really care.

01:10:00.491 --> 01:10:03.267
Then I'll tell you
after we wrap.

01:10:04.195 --> 01:10:06.402
No, only if you tell me now.

01:10:07.198 --> 01:10:09.678
Then after you sign
the contract.

01:10:11.135 --> 01:10:13.203
You'll probably
change your mind...

01:10:13.204 --> 01:10:15.810
No, forget it!
I won't do it!

01:10:16.106 --> 01:10:17.847
Okay, whatever.

01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:24.352
Wanna get some schnitzel?

01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:27.488
Go away.

01:10:28.018 --> 01:10:29.190
I'm buying!

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:40.833
Kimchi soup and wine's
a great match.

01:10:41.799 --> 01:10:44.075
You said it'd be too weird.

01:10:44.501 --> 01:10:45.501
Want more?

01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:47.470
Okay.

01:10:54.945 --> 01:10:57.391
It worked! It's here!
It's here!

01:10:57.881 --> 01:10:59.588
It actually worked!

01:10:59.883 --> 01:11:01.089
He wants to meet.

01:11:01.885 --> 01:11:04.627
Min-ho wants to have
brunch with me.

01:11:04.722 --> 01:11:06.565
See? I told you so.

01:11:06.657 --> 01:11:09.035
He fell for my beauty.

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:11.237
Thanks anyway.

01:11:15.332 --> 01:11:17.334
I should stop eating.

01:11:19.036 --> 01:11:20.242
What do I wear?

01:11:27.945 --> 01:11:31.222
To think that a beauty like you
came to the ER...

01:11:32.216 --> 01:11:34.787
I don't ever want to
remember that.

01:11:35.452 --> 01:11:37.090
Was it funny?

01:11:37.554 --> 01:11:39.932
Well, just a tiny a bit.

01:11:41.392 --> 01:11:44.498
But at least that night
brought us together.

01:11:46.630 --> 01:11:47.938
That's good.

01:11:48.365 --> 01:11:50.345
I bet you're tired
on your day off,

01:11:51.835 --> 01:11:54.372
but from exhibits to hiking,
you're really keeping busy.

01:11:54.471 --> 01:11:58.977
Not at all, I get bored easily.

01:12:00.844 --> 01:12:03.723
I actually enjoy hiking,
we should go together.

01:12:05.182 --> 01:12:06.182
Hiking?

01:12:07.818 --> 01:12:09.229
Yes, sure.

01:12:09.586 --> 01:12:12.692
Great, we should hangout.

01:12:17.828 --> 01:12:18.863
Okay.

01:12:21.498 --> 01:12:26.140
I shouldn't have worn heels,
my calves are cramping.

01:12:27.104 --> 01:12:29.015
Nothing in this world
is ever easy.

01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:31.286
Especially if you want
a doctor husband.

01:12:33.477 --> 01:12:34.547
Do they hurt a lot?

01:12:35.245 --> 01:12:36.918
It's occupational hazard.

01:12:39.450 --> 01:12:40.485
Give me your foot.

01:12:40.951 --> 01:12:41.951
What?

01:12:42.586 --> 01:12:48.366
I debated whether to open
a massage parlor or a diner.

01:12:48.492 --> 01:12:50.529
These are magic fingers.

01:12:50.828 --> 01:12:51.828
Give it.

01:12:52.062 --> 01:12:53.097
Come on!

01:12:53.664 --> 01:12:56.008
We dry each other's undies.

01:12:58.068 --> 01:13:00.070
Or are you falling for me?

01:13:00.204 --> 01:13:01.239
What?

01:13:01.972 --> 01:13:03.451
Like hell!

01:13:06.477 --> 01:13:09.890
$5 for 10 minutes per foot,
$10 for both, okay?

01:13:14.551 --> 01:13:15.551
Oh my god...

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:18.199
You're really good.

01:13:18.922 --> 01:13:22.233
You got yourself
a solid backup business.

01:13:24.528 --> 01:13:27.566
I sometimes can't sleep
because I'm so curious.

01:13:28.365 --> 01:13:29.503
About what?

01:13:29.867 --> 01:13:32.404
What exactly am I bad at?
So curious.

01:13:32.536 --> 01:13:38.680
This isn't a cramp, it's fat.

01:13:38.942 --> 01:13:40.387
It's not fat!

01:13:43.781 --> 01:13:47.854
Take your shoes off inflight,
it'll cramp up more.

01:13:53.157 --> 01:13:54.158
Time's up!

01:14:14.878 --> 01:14:17.415
Where are you?
I'm almost there.

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:24.331
Almost there too.

01:14:26.590 --> 01:14:30.367
There's something
I really want to tell you.

01:14:40.404 --> 01:14:42.611
Didn't you hear me honk?

01:14:44.007 --> 01:14:45.111
Are you nuts?

01:14:46.043 --> 01:14:47.283
Frigging deaf?

01:14:47.377 --> 01:14:49.618
It's the busiest time
of the day!

01:14:51.415 --> 01:14:53.258
Whatâ€œ you do, huh'?

01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:55.852
Sir, I'm sorry...

01:14:55.853 --> 01:14:59.858
I can't... hear very well...

01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:03.394
I honked from
all the way up there,

01:15:03.627 --> 01:15:05.129
everyone got out of the way.

01:15:05.496 --> 01:15:06.634
You didn't hear that?

01:15:08.632 --> 01:15:11.701
I'm so sorry, I really am.

01:15:11.702 --> 01:15:12.442
That's it.

01:15:12.503 --> 01:15:13.503
I'm done working.

01:15:14.438 --> 01:15:15.508
Take some pictures.

01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:18.778
Sir, please...

01:15:19.810 --> 01:15:23.189
I can't hear anything,
I'm so sorry.

01:15:23.647 --> 01:15:26.628
I'll compensate you.
Please, sir...

01:15:26.917 --> 01:15:29.488
You don't look like a cripple.

01:15:30.254 --> 01:15:32.894
And talk fine too.
Youngsters nowadays.

01:15:33.190 --> 01:15:33.723
I'm so sorry.

01:15:33.724 --> 01:15:36.364
You want me to accept
petty change and go away?

01:15:39.930 --> 01:15:40.965
I'll let this Slide.

01:16:10.827 --> 01:16:11.828
Na-yun...

01:16:15.399 --> 01:16:19.814
I had something
to tell you today.

01:16:22.172 --> 01:16:27.144
This isn't how
I wanted to say it.

01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:35.692
We got a play to catch.

01:16:45.062 --> 01:16:47.099
But...

01:16:48.165 --> 01:16:51.339
I'm so raggedy today.

01:16:56.740 --> 01:16:58.083
How about...

01:17:02.145 --> 01:17:04.455
pasta next time then?

01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:18.261
I'm kidding.

01:17:22.232 --> 01:17:23.302
Na-yun...

01:17:27.104 --> 01:17:28.104
I didn't...

01:17:29.873 --> 01:17:31.250
mean to hide it.

01:17:31.341 --> 01:17:32.376
Su-ho.

01:17:35.746 --> 01:17:37.157
I'm fine with it.

01:17:57.534 --> 01:17:58.535
I'm sorry.

01:18:00.537 --> 01:18:02.744
But I don't think I am.

01:18:12.115 --> 01:18:13.253
I'm gonna go.

01:18:35.605 --> 01:18:38.677
Why does it have to be Roh?

01:18:39.209 --> 01:18:43.453
I'm writing,
starring a top female lead,

01:18:43.814 --> 01:18:47.193
and the production company
has a good track record.

01:18:49.519 --> 01:18:51.726
Is the director confirmed?

01:18:53.223 --> 01:18:55.635
We're in talks,
we'll get an answer soon.

01:18:57.127 --> 01:19:00.768
No director, no male lead.

01:19:01.798 --> 01:19:03.539
We won't meet the deadline.

01:19:04.768 --> 01:19:08.614
Shouldn't you have a plan
as the producer, Ms. Jang?

01:19:09.973 --> 01:19:13.819
Ma'am, I really don't.

01:19:15.712 --> 01:19:16.918
Director?

01:19:17.781 --> 01:19:20.557
There aren't many directors
who'll work with you.

01:19:22.919 --> 01:19:24.762
Jang Na-yun...

01:19:25.789 --> 01:19:27.029
Actors?

01:19:28.058 --> 01:19:30.368
No one wants to be
bossed around by you.

01:19:31.461 --> 01:19:33.839
Why don't we get some food?

01:19:34.531 --> 01:19:38.274
Then what?
What's the solution?

01:19:39.002 --> 01:19:43.542
While you're still on top,
please be mindful of others.

01:19:48.745 --> 01:19:49.745
One...

01:19:51.281 --> 01:19:52.281
Good.

01:19:53.884 --> 01:19:54.919
New hairdo?

01:19:55.852 --> 01:19:58.389
- Yup, is it good?
- So much better.

01:19:59.222 --> 01:20:00.860
- It's up, check it out.
- Yeah?

01:20:01.158 --> 01:20:04.867
My god, look at the views.

01:20:05.929 --> 01:20:08.239
He's a mega star after all.

01:20:08.698 --> 01:20:09.870
Picture came out great.

01:20:10.167 --> 01:20:12.010
Ms. Jo looks melancholy.
Cheer up!

01:20:12.235 --> 01:20:13.236
What's up?

01:20:14.104 --> 01:20:15.104
Nothing.

01:20:34.124 --> 01:20:36.604
Na-yun: Plz, pick up the phone...

01:20:39.329 --> 01:20:41.673
You said I could bother you!

01:20:45.268 --> 01:20:46.906
I miss you...

01:21:05.288 --> 01:21:06.665
Wait!

01:21:09.793 --> 01:21:12.603
Check it out,
are the eyebrows straight?

01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:15.030
It's fine.

01:21:15.131 --> 01:21:17.042
How's this dress?

01:21:18.068 --> 01:21:20.412
- Do I look old in it?
- But you are old.

01:21:24.841 --> 01:21:26.787
It's appropriately pretty.

01:21:27.811 --> 01:21:30.052
What's with the sour face?

01:21:30.981 --> 01:21:35.430
Did he mention that
I didn't live up to his expectation?

01:21:36.286 --> 01:21:38.232
Who knows, we're not very close.

01:21:38.655 --> 01:21:39.827
Come on!

01:21:40.624 --> 01:21:44.731
When I text him,
he's always late to reply.

01:21:45.061 --> 01:21:46.540
Maybe he was in surgery.

01:21:46.630 --> 01:21:48.166
Even on his day off.

01:21:48.498 --> 01:21:51.104
I had to ask him out
on a date today.

01:21:51.468 --> 01:21:53.675
He has no reason to rush.

01:21:54.537 --> 01:21:56.744
Why did you have to bait a kid?

01:21:57.841 --> 01:22:00.082
I distinctly remember
your 20/20 vision.

01:22:01.144 --> 01:22:03.522
Some people are fated.

01:22:03.813 --> 01:22:06.657
If it's not meant to be,
you can part ways.

01:22:06.850 --> 01:22:09.296
So don't go all-in.

01:22:10.387 --> 01:22:14.392
Yeah, if he keeps up,
I'll end it.

01:22:14.658 --> 01:22:16.262
I'm only getting older.

01:22:16.393 --> 01:22:17.963
Come to the diner later.

01:22:18.261 --> 01:22:19.865
I got a new dish,
review it for me.

01:22:21.164 --> 01:22:22.199
Okay.

01:22:24.234 --> 01:22:25.304
Good luck!

01:22:29.506 --> 01:22:31.008
I knew they weren't a match.

01:22:36.413 --> 01:22:37.983
Is your schedule
for next month out?

01:22:39.215 --> 01:22:41.024
Yes, why?

01:22:41.985 --> 01:22:44.158
Do you have a flight
this holiday?

01:22:44.955 --> 01:22:48.164
No, I'll be back the day before.

01:22:48.591 --> 01:22:49.591
That's great!

01:22:49.826 --> 01:22:52.432
Would you like to
visit my folks in Tokyo?

01:22:53.363 --> 01:22:54.171
Pardon?

01:22:54.264 --> 01:22:59.077
My mother likes to
invite the entire family

01:22:59.336 --> 01:23:01.976
for the Golden Dragon
Dance Festival.

01:23:02.238 --> 01:23:03.238
Jesus...

01:23:03.873 --> 01:23:06.183
I always wanted to go.

01:23:06.643 --> 01:23:09.852
My brother's family
and my folks will be there,

01:23:10.046 --> 01:23:12.424
so please come.
It's actually fun.

01:23:13.283 --> 01:23:14.421
Well...

01:23:22.559 --> 01:23:23.902
She said she'll take a cab,

01:23:24.361 --> 01:23:25.361
she should be here.

01:23:32.168 --> 01:23:33.704
Hey! Welcome!

01:23:36.473 --> 01:23:37.473
Hey!

01:23:39.709 --> 01:23:42.485
Min-ho too.

01:23:51.087 --> 01:23:52.361
Looks delicious!

01:23:54.557 --> 01:23:56.559
What should we drink?

01:23:57.027 --> 01:23:59.234
What'd go well with this?

01:24:00.697 --> 01:24:01.903
Soju, for sure.

01:24:02.298 --> 01:24:03.298
Soju?

01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:06.044
- We had wine earlier.
- Yeah!

01:24:06.302 --> 01:24:08.407
We did drink quite a bit.

01:24:09.072 --> 01:24:10.415
Will you be okay mixing drinks?

01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:11.983
Just a bit more?

01:24:12.542 --> 01:24:14.818
- Sake?
- Great.

01:24:15.545 --> 01:24:17.047
Have you read
director Ryu's script?

01:24:17.113 --> 01:24:18.615
I will, one day.

01:24:18.882 --> 01:24:21.920
You gotta pick something,
what'll you do?

01:24:22.318 --> 01:24:24.423
What about Ms. Jo?
What happened to it?

01:24:24.921 --> 01:24:26.696
It's dead, she pulled out.

01:24:26.790 --> 01:24:27.790
Why?

01:24:28.691 --> 01:24:30.102
Who knows?

01:24:30.326 --> 01:24:32.465
Just read the script, okay?

01:24:43.807 --> 01:24:45.946
- Please continue.
- Okay.

01:25:01.357 --> 01:25:04.827
Eh? You didn't finish
my food back there.

01:25:08.465 --> 01:25:11.002
I was craving for beer.

01:25:12.368 --> 01:25:16.180
So you prefer canned beer
over expensive sake?

01:25:18.675 --> 01:25:21.554
I guess I'm not comfy
around him yet.

01:25:22.112 --> 01:25:24.991
Your dishes were amazing...

01:25:25.748 --> 01:25:27.625
You shoulda brought some.

01:25:27.884 --> 01:25:29.795
Maybe because you want to
look good to him.

01:25:31.888 --> 01:25:34.801
You don't seem to have
that problem with me.

01:25:35.125 --> 01:25:37.867
And you? Do you even
see me as a woman?

01:25:40.697 --> 01:25:43.109
Are you not?
Definitely not a guy.

01:25:43.633 --> 01:25:44.771
Of course I do.

01:25:48.104 --> 01:25:49.104
Really?

01:25:50.073 --> 01:25:52.110
So how are we so platonic?

01:26:13.563 --> 01:26:16.043
You got food on your lips.

01:26:17.567 --> 01:26:19.240
You only pretend to be tidy.

01:26:21.704 --> 01:26:23.980
Did Min-ho go home okay?

01:26:40.023 --> 01:26:42.367
London Travel:
Happiness of a Dreamer

01:26:48.031 --> 01:26:49.704
New Email

01:26:51.034 --> 01:26:53.241
Huh? It's mom.

01:26:53.503 --> 01:26:54.811
Check Email

01:26:55.104 --> 01:26:56.447
From: Ex-wife

01:26:56.573 --> 01:26:58.348
How are you?

01:26:58.741 --> 01:27:02.382
Could EJ come to London?
Perhaps in the summer?

01:27:15.158 --> 01:27:17.695
I'm out from, how about a drink?

01:27:24.934 --> 01:27:27.778
What's going on?
I haven't seen you in a bit.

01:27:28.838 --> 01:27:29.942
Let's drink.

01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:38.884
- Sung-chan.
- Yeah?

01:27:39.916 --> 01:27:40.951
My...

01:27:42.785 --> 01:27:43.923
hearing...

01:27:44.587 --> 01:27:46.498
You said it's fine,

01:27:48.124 --> 01:27:50.331
that no one will notice,
you said that.

01:27:52.795 --> 01:27:54.365
Yeah, I did.

01:27:57.834 --> 01:27:58.834
But I...

01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:05.541
worked so hard to
understand everyone.

01:28:07.243 --> 01:28:08.620
So what, though?

01:28:09.679 --> 01:28:11.716
I don't actually
understand anything.

01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:21.734
I can't hear anything,
not a damn thing...

01:28:29.499 --> 01:28:30.499
Su-ho.

01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:59.670
This is a great combo.

01:29:00.263 --> 01:29:02.265
So we finally get to
work together?

01:29:02.799 --> 01:29:05.075
I assumed we lost you
to Ms. Jo.

01:29:05.501 --> 01:29:07.742
I'm not bound by any contract.

01:29:08.771 --> 01:29:10.409
I heard her project's dead.

01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:13.243
She's a tenacious writer.

01:29:13.443 --> 01:29:15.889
She'll be back with a major hit.

01:29:16.579 --> 01:29:19.116
Yeah, she sure will.

01:29:19.549 --> 01:29:22.428
No lovers whatsoever,
then barn, a baby.

01:29:23.086 --> 01:29:26.090
Her life is a soap opera,
so much secrecy.

01:29:26.189 --> 01:29:29.068
Sperm bank, probably?
That's the rumor anyway.

01:29:29.492 --> 01:29:31.403
I thought there was a father.

01:29:31.494 --> 01:29:32.494
Who?

01:29:33.429 --> 01:29:34.601
The MBC CP?

01:29:34.997 --> 01:29:37.773
I heard that too,
but sounds like a BS.

01:29:38.468 --> 01:29:39.947
Anything's possible.

01:29:40.403 --> 01:29:43.646
- Mr. Jang, you know anything?
- No, not at all.

01:29:43.906 --> 01:29:45.476
Spill it.

01:29:46.509 --> 01:29:48.216
I'm sure you got the scoop.

01:29:49.112 --> 01:29:53.026
Director, I don't think
I can do this.

01:29:54.851 --> 01:29:55.921
The script...

01:29:58.488 --> 01:30:00.627
Hey, Jin-woo...

01:30:16.706 --> 01:30:18.083
Wanna get a drink?

01:30:18.908 --> 01:30:20.387
Why should I?

01:30:21.277 --> 01:30:22.881
Talk about the script...

01:30:23.613 --> 01:30:24.679
You rejected it.

01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:29.254
Because I thought
I'd be uncomfortable.

01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:32.599
The script is really good.

01:30:33.556 --> 01:30:37.436
But now I feel uncomfortable.

01:30:39.262 --> 01:30:42.675
I got no intention to
reveal the father either.

01:30:43.633 --> 01:30:45.579
I know you won't tell me,

01:30:47.970 --> 01:30:51.850
but what if he grows up
and asks you about him?

01:30:51.941 --> 01:30:53.579
You'll never tell him?

01:30:58.748 --> 01:30:59.886
I haven't...

01:31:01.551 --> 01:31:03.189
thought about that far.

01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:06.058
Why are you so selfish?

01:31:09.525 --> 01:31:13.405
My mother said to me
before she passed.

01:31:14.530 --> 01:31:18.945
'Raise a kid just like you,
and feel the hardship.'

01:31:20.169 --> 01:31:23.446
Sol intend to.

01:31:30.346 --> 01:31:31.346
Hey.

01:31:32.448 --> 01:31:37.625
Instrumentation on this
can be rough,

01:31:40.423 --> 01:31:42.232
but I want it to sound lonely.

01:32:15.458 --> 01:32:17.199
I'm doing all this for you,

01:32:18.861 --> 01:32:22.172
but I almost sold you out.

01:32:24.166 --> 01:32:26.203
Human affairs are messy.

01:32:28.137 --> 01:32:30.617
Should we just take off?

01:33:14.617 --> 01:33:19.362
Dad, I know you two
are divorced.

01:33:20.323 --> 01:33:22.599
I'm going to London to see mom.

01:33:22.992 --> 01:33:24.369
Don't drink too much.

01:33:28.464 --> 01:33:29.499
Wait, wait!

01:33:32.201 --> 01:33:33.544
- Leaving?
- Yes.

01:33:34.403 --> 01:33:37.407
Maintain courtesy
in front of the elders.

01:33:37.773 --> 01:33:41.186
Keep your eyes low,
and speak quietly.

01:33:41.310 --> 01:33:44.189
I got it!
No more nag.

01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:46.291
Those shoes are all wrong.

01:33:49.785 --> 01:33:52.026
Heels on those
need to be replaced.

01:33:52.221 --> 01:33:54.497
Already did,
I noticed it before.

01:34:06.836 --> 01:34:07.836
Here.

01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:13.547
Why're you so nice to me?

01:34:15.211 --> 01:34:18.886
Helping out a less
fortunate roommate.

01:34:19.181 --> 01:34:22.390
And hoping to
get rid of me ASAP?

01:34:22.618 --> 01:34:25.792
My protege is all grown up.

01:34:29.492 --> 01:34:33.133
It'll be a quiet weekend
for once.

01:34:34.330 --> 01:34:35.934
What're you doing today?

01:34:36.465 --> 01:34:37.773
Man the shop, of course.

01:34:38.701 --> 01:34:40.647
I left you a gift on the table.

01:34:41.103 --> 01:34:42.275
It's your birthday.

01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:46.613
How did you know?

01:34:46.742 --> 01:34:49.655
Who else would look after you?

01:34:50.846 --> 01:34:51.846
I'm off.

01:34:53.282 --> 01:34:54.282
Okay...

01:35:32.154 --> 01:35:33.326
EJ, let's eat.

01:35:35.057 --> 01:35:36.057
Son?

01:35:47.903 --> 01:35:49.405
- Sir?
- Yeah?

01:35:49.572 --> 01:35:51.108
Have you seen Ms. Jo's text?

01:35:53.008 --> 01:35:54.351
I'm leaving Korea today.

01:35:54.610 --> 01:35:57.648
Go easy on product placement,
and focus on quality.

01:35:57.913 --> 01:35:58.913
Bye.

01:35:58.948 --> 01:36:00.154
She's hysteric...

01:36:06.789 --> 01:36:10.430
It's my regular route,
but today feels different.

01:36:14.797 --> 01:36:16.435
Sung-chan likes your photo.

01:36:16.532 --> 01:36:18.011
That was fast.

01:36:18.834 --> 01:36:20.438
No diners yet?

01:36:22.938 --> 01:36:23.973
Damn it!

01:36:27.343 --> 01:36:28.822
It's not your fault.

01:36:29.678 --> 01:36:32.352
How'd you understand my heart?

01:36:33.482 --> 01:36:34.482
My eyes...

01:36:37.453 --> 01:36:38.453
Afternoon.

01:36:40.756 --> 01:36:41.928
It's been a while.

01:36:42.358 --> 01:36:43.359
Indeed.

01:36:45.494 --> 01:36:46.666
Happy birthday.

01:36:47.163 --> 01:36:48.163
What is it?

01:36:49.198 --> 01:36:50.064
How did you know?

01:36:50.065 --> 01:36:51.567
Facebook notification.

01:36:54.336 --> 01:36:55.337
Thanks.

01:36:58.941 --> 01:37:00.852
Does Su-ho come by often?

01:37:01.477 --> 01:37:04.287
What's wrong with you two?

01:37:04.947 --> 01:37:06.654
He won't see me.

01:37:11.153 --> 01:37:13.997
He went on a trip alone,
I guess he skipped town.

01:37:15.524 --> 01:37:17.333
Be good to each other.

01:37:20.596 --> 01:37:22.735
- Not here?
- EJ's dad.

01:37:22.998 --> 01:37:25.501
Did Su-ho and EJ come here
by any chance?

01:37:25.868 --> 01:37:28.872
- Su-ho went to Pohang.
- Pohang?

01:37:29.572 --> 01:37:32.348
Then who's he with?
Where is he?

01:37:32.441 --> 01:37:34.978
- Have you called him?
- No answer.

01:37:37.213 --> 01:37:39.380
I'll be back.
No booze for her.

01:37:39.381 --> 01:37:40.587
- Okay.
- Wait for me!

01:37:41.550 --> 01:37:42.654
Hey! Wait for me!

01:37:44.186 --> 01:37:45.460
Who is he looking for?

01:37:45.821 --> 01:37:49.564
There's a kid who comes by
from time to time for lunch.

01:37:50.526 --> 01:37:51.527
Where could he be?

01:38:05.674 --> 01:38:08.245
Jae-byung!
Whose song is this?

01:38:09.345 --> 01:38:12.224
This is Wind Sunny,
that composer you like.

01:38:13.148 --> 01:38:15.219
You recognized it right away!

01:38:16.886 --> 01:38:17.956
Wanna give it a listen?

01:38:18.587 --> 01:38:20.157
It's too good
to listen to alone.

01:38:20.789 --> 01:38:22.029
But I want it for myself.

01:38:23.125 --> 01:38:24.502
Close your eyes

01:38:26.328 --> 01:38:28.535
ever so slowly

01:38:29.632 --> 01:38:31.270
You disappear

01:38:32.768 --> 01:38:35.374
from my sight

01:38:35.938 --> 01:38:37.747
I can almost,

01:38:39.375 --> 01:38:42.049
almost hear you

01:38:42.778 --> 01:38:44.758
I can almost

01:38:46.081 --> 01:38:48.755
hear your voice

01:38:49.318 --> 01:38:52.629
Love me

01:38:52.988 --> 01:38:55.935
I want to say

01:38:58.193 --> 01:39:01.868
I know I'm asking a lot

01:39:02.598 --> 01:39:05.875
Love me

01:39:06.368 --> 01:39:09.315
I want to say

01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:15.047
Could you do that?

01:39:15.611 --> 01:39:16.783
Wait for me!

01:39:18.180 --> 01:39:20.956
Go this way,
I'll check the school.

01:39:21.050 --> 01:39:22.283
- This way?
- Yes, please.

01:39:22.284 --> 01:39:23.284
I got it.

01:39:23.552 --> 01:39:25.725
- Did EJ come here?
- I haven't seen him.

01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:30.063
Kids, have you seen EJ?

01:39:37.099 --> 01:39:40.376
EJ is missing.
Know where he could be?

01:39:43.272 --> 01:39:46.549
She said he's not yours,
what is the matter with you?!

01:39:47.076 --> 01:39:48.111
You can't!

01:39:48.844 --> 01:39:52.223
Why'd you intentionally
sabotage your career?

01:39:52.548 --> 01:39:55.688
If that goes public,
you're done!

01:39:56.251 --> 01:39:57.730
It's all over for you.

01:39:58.120 --> 01:39:59.895
The advertisers will sue us.

01:40:00.122 --> 01:40:02.568
You're contracted for 7,
including the Chinese.

01:40:03.025 --> 01:40:06.438
Breach of contract penalty
will be over $1 Om!

01:40:06.695 --> 01:40:08.504
I'll pay it all back.

01:40:09.665 --> 01:40:10.871
If I'm short...

01:40:12.968 --> 01:40:15.005
you can help.

01:40:16.505 --> 01:40:17.916
I'll pay in installments.

01:40:19.375 --> 01:40:20.683
No interest, please.

01:40:23.245 --> 01:40:24.690
Son of a bitch...

01:40:34.556 --> 01:40:35.556
Jin-woo.

01:40:36.058 --> 01:40:38.231
We worked so hard
to get to where we are.

01:40:38.861 --> 01:40:40.238
It'll disappear in a flash.

01:40:43.365 --> 01:40:46.073
Let's talk after you
come back from China.

01:40:56.512 --> 01:40:57.684
Keep them back!

01:41:02.785 --> 01:41:03.889
My child is missing!

01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:05.990
- Would you like to report?
- Yes.

01:41:06.355 --> 01:41:08.631
- What's his name?
- EJ, Jung EJ.

01:41:08.724 --> 01:41:10.135
- Age?
- 8 years old.

01:41:10.426 --> 01:41:13.032
Height, physical description,
and clothes he was wearing?

01:41:13.128 --> 01:41:14.698
- One second.
- Isn't that EJ?

01:41:14.797 --> 01:41:15.797
What?

01:41:16.665 --> 01:41:21.011
Hundreds of fans came to
Incheon Airport to see Roh Jin-woo.

01:41:21.103 --> 01:41:22.207
We hope he...

01:41:27.776 --> 01:41:30.484
Words travel fast,
how did you know I was leaving?

01:41:30.612 --> 01:41:32.888
Ma'am, Jin-woo's going crazy.

01:41:33.482 --> 01:41:35.689
He keeps saying it's his kid,

01:41:35.818 --> 01:41:38.389
and that he'll take
responsibility for him.

01:41:39.655 --> 01:41:41.999
I managed to
hold him off for a bit,

01:41:42.091 --> 01:41:43.968
but he's a loose cannon.

01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:48.999
You're the only one
who can defuse this.

01:41:53.235 --> 01:41:55.112
Photos unavailable

01:42:00.642 --> 01:42:01.814
I miss her.

01:42:09.485 --> 01:42:10.555
You Okay?

01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:12.955
What?

01:42:13.255 --> 01:42:14.255
Not gonna start?

01:42:16.291 --> 01:42:17.463
What was the first line?

01:42:18.694 --> 01:42:20.537
You didn't even practice?

01:42:21.296 --> 01:42:22.969
I practiced like crazy.

01:42:23.765 --> 01:42:25.335
Even memorized them.

01:42:25.868 --> 01:42:26.868
Then?

01:42:30.305 --> 01:42:33.411
I'm so nervous, I forgot them.

01:42:33.909 --> 01:42:34.979
I'm sorry.

01:42:35.244 --> 01:42:37.349
Did I stare too hard?

01:42:37.813 --> 01:42:38.883
Not at all.

01:42:40.482 --> 01:42:41.586
You're really pretty.

01:42:43.552 --> 01:42:46.726
You're... so stunning.

01:42:51.527 --> 01:42:54.565
You'd be perfect for
delivering cheesy lines.

01:42:54.863 --> 01:42:57.207
And he knows exactly
who's in charge here.

01:42:58.734 --> 01:43:02.614
Thank you for that,
but this is an audition.

01:43:03.338 --> 01:43:04.976
Do you need more time?

01:43:05.307 --> 01:43:08.015
No, I can do it right away.

01:43:08.110 --> 01:43:09.248
I'll begin now.

01:43:16.852 --> 01:43:17.922
At first,

01:43:19.588 --> 01:43:21.261
when I was with you,

01:43:22.958 --> 01:43:26.462
I felt as though
I became a better person.

01:43:28.764 --> 01:43:30.607
Because you're so magnificent.

01:43:33.669 --> 01:43:34.669
Pretty good.

01:43:35.003 --> 01:43:37.313
Yeah, not bad.

01:43:38.874 --> 01:43:40.649
But there isn't a role for him.

01:43:42.844 --> 01:43:45.085
I'll flesh out Tae-ho.

01:43:45.847 --> 01:43:46.848
What?

01:43:48.283 --> 01:43:50.957
You'll change
a minor character for him?

01:43:51.453 --> 01:43:52.523
Just watch.

01:43:53.355 --> 01:43:57.599
He'll be a major star
before you know it.

01:43:59.161 --> 01:44:03.473
Wow, I've never seen you
so sure about an actor.

01:44:07.803 --> 01:44:09.612
But I still want to be together.

01:44:11.807 --> 01:44:14.083
I can't explain it concisely,

01:44:15.677 --> 01:44:17.281
but it felt like 'spring'.

01:44:20.682 --> 01:44:21.786
Spring?

01:44:24.019 --> 01:44:25.191
Spring...

01:44:26.855 --> 01:44:28.528
You moron...

01:44:34.129 --> 01:44:35.904
Hello?

01:44:36.598 --> 01:44:39.374
Please just listen,
do me this favor.

01:44:40.002 --> 01:44:41.002
Jin-woo.

01:44:42.804 --> 01:44:48.914
You began with a minor role
in my series, right?

01:44:50.979 --> 01:44:54.449
You worked hard
to be where you are now.

01:44:55.317 --> 01:44:58.696
I was happy to see you
become your own.

01:44:59.755 --> 01:45:04.067
So don't give up
what you worked so hard for.

01:45:05.827 --> 01:45:08.307
Why did you have to hide it?

01:45:09.464 --> 01:45:12.741
Even if you deny it,
truth still remains.

01:45:16.605 --> 01:45:18.482
Am I not good enough
to be his father?

01:45:19.941 --> 01:45:21.579
Afraid of what others might say?

01:45:21.710 --> 01:45:23.656
What changes then?!

01:45:24.012 --> 01:45:26.515
What changes when you
come out as his dad?

01:45:27.849 --> 01:45:30.352
When the word gets out,

01:45:30.552 --> 01:45:33.362
you'll blame yourself
for settling down with a kid.

01:45:34.423 --> 01:45:38.803
Don't make it hard
for Spring and me, please.

01:45:39.728 --> 01:45:42.265
- - I want to live quietly.
- Okay.

01:45:42.864 --> 01:45:47.244
Fine, let's meet after
I come back from China.

01:45:50.906 --> 01:45:52.510
Spring and I are leaving.

01:45:52.774 --> 01:45:54.913
Leaving where?!

01:45:56.311 --> 01:45:58.552
Why are you so keen to hide?

01:45:58.914 --> 01:46:00.222
I've said my piece.

01:46:00.649 --> 01:46:01.684
Good bye.

01:46:33.248 --> 01:46:34.248
Sir!

01:47:01.910 --> 01:47:07.417
I write this public post
to my fans for a favor.

01:47:08.049 --> 01:47:09.995
I have a son.

01:47:11.353 --> 01:47:13.390
And a woman I love.

01:47:15.457 --> 01:47:17.835
She's trying to leave me
with my son.

01:47:18.126 --> 01:47:19.696
She won't answer my calls.

01:47:22.030 --> 01:47:25.102
She may be at Incheon Airport,
but it's much too big.

01:47:28.036 --> 01:47:30.846
If you've seen this woman,
please contact me.

01:47:30.972 --> 01:47:35.614
Hold her clown, I'm begging you.

01:47:36.044 --> 01:47:36.852
No way!

01:47:36.945 --> 01:47:38.788
That can't be!

01:47:59.568 --> 01:48:01.741
Have you found EJ?
I'm at the airport.

01:48:05.674 --> 01:48:06.674
Dude!

01:48:17.118 --> 01:48:19.860
A ticket to London, 1 child.

01:48:21.056 --> 01:48:22.626
Where are your parents?

01:48:24.626 --> 01:48:25.626
Gonna go to the washroom.

01:48:32.601 --> 01:48:33.909
My 90Â¢â€œ...

01:48:36.471 --> 01:48:38.109
I've seen her somewhere.

01:48:41.109 --> 01:48:42.884
- I'm sorry!
- It's okay.

01:48:43.178 --> 01:48:44.282
You okay?
Sorry, kiddo.

01:48:47.082 --> 01:48:48.254
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

01:48:49.317 --> 01:48:50.489
Could be her...

01:49:14.943 --> 01:49:16.752
Why are you here?

01:49:18.547 --> 01:49:19.547
Yes?

01:49:20.415 --> 01:49:22.292
Yes, that's him.
Where?

01:49:24.653 --> 01:49:25.653
Okay!

01:49:30.258 --> 01:49:31.328
EJ!

01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:32.995
Dad!

01:49:34.529 --> 01:49:39.137
I want to see mom, I'll be back.

01:49:39.467 --> 01:49:40.912
Please.

01:49:42.871 --> 01:49:47.081
Ticketing won't be possible
without a guardian.

01:49:47.175 --> 01:49:48.620
He can't board either.

01:49:49.277 --> 01:49:50.381
Right?

01:49:50.879 --> 01:49:53.359
Should I request a PSA?

01:49:53.715 --> 01:49:55.456
I already did,
they'll announce it.

01:49:56.818 --> 01:49:58.957
We found EJ.

01:49:59.421 --> 01:50:00.422
He's found!

01:50:01.489 --> 01:50:02.968
That's good!

01:50:14.436 --> 01:50:15.436
I should go.

01:50:23.044 --> 01:50:24.044
Bye.

01:50:42.297 --> 01:50:43.297
Shall we?

01:50:51.172 --> 01:50:54.915
I found her!
Air Traffic Cafe! Hurry!

01:51:09.391 --> 01:51:10.961
Looks like I'm too late.

01:51:11.693 --> 01:51:13.263
Where are you hiding?

01:51:14.596 --> 01:51:16.974
If I don't see you today,
I'll disappear,

01:51:18.066 --> 01:51:20.307
so don't hold back.

01:51:23.505 --> 01:51:25.678
- I'll come to you.
- No, I'll come.

01:51:27.142 --> 01:51:28.142
Wait for me.

01:51:48.063 --> 01:51:49.098
Ms. Jo!

01:51:50.265 --> 01:51:51.471
Ms. Jo!

01:51:57.706 --> 01:51:58.707
Ms. Jo!

01:52:01.076 --> 01:52:02.146
Kyung-ah!

01:52:16.524 --> 01:52:17.524
Ms. Jo!

01:52:20.028 --> 01:52:21.029
Jin-woo...

01:52:24.599 --> 01:52:28.479
Are you an idiot?
Nothing'll change.

01:52:28.670 --> 01:52:30.172
But it already has.

01:52:30.472 --> 01:52:31.542
Don't you get it?

01:52:32.040 --> 01:52:34.782
I don't want to
complicate your life too!

01:52:35.110 --> 01:52:37.784
It's always about you,
always saying your piece!

01:52:38.713 --> 01:52:42.559
You think I'll do whatever
you want like in your drama?

01:52:42.951 --> 01:52:45.795
He's my son,
carve your own path.

01:52:54.129 --> 01:52:56.302
You keep mentioning him,

01:52:57.532 --> 01:53:01.537
but I'm not doing this
for him alone.

01:53:06.808 --> 01:53:07.878
Jo Kyung-ah.

01:53:11.546 --> 01:53:13.526
If I'm doing this for you,

01:53:15.784 --> 01:53:17.161
will you stay?

01:53:28.296 --> 01:53:29.969
So embarrassing...

01:53:31.633 --> 01:53:32.805
I wish I could hide.

01:53:38.273 --> 01:53:39.445
Don't go away.

01:53:44.445 --> 01:53:45.924
Or we can hide together.

01:53:55.290 --> 01:53:56.598
Don't go.

01:54:46.407 --> 01:54:50.116
Writing a song and leaving
isn't cool at all.

01:54:51.246 --> 01:54:53.590
You promised we'd
go to Homigot together!

01:54:55.083 --> 01:54:56.391
So stupid!

01:54:57.652 --> 01:55:00.258
I thought I was gonna
freeze to death!

01:55:02.257 --> 01:55:03.327
I'm sorry.

01:55:19.674 --> 01:55:22.848
I'll let it slide
because you're cute.

01:55:25.446 --> 01:55:27.357
What?
Did you say something?

01:55:28.182 --> 01:55:29.183
I'm hungry-

01:55:30.718 --> 01:55:31.924
I brought billfish.

01:55:34.555 --> 01:55:35.966
I brought billfish.

01:56:00.148 --> 01:56:04.358
I helped everyone out,
but I'm all alone.

01:56:05.486 --> 01:56:07.762
You're alcohol, and you too.

01:56:09.123 --> 01:56:12.696
I'm alcohol, we are the alcohol!

01:56:12.961 --> 01:56:14.941
We are the alcohol!

01:56:16.631 --> 01:56:18.304
Are you taking
a shower with that?

01:56:19.901 --> 01:56:22.108
Huh? Why're you here?

01:56:24.072 --> 01:56:25.210
Did you cause a stink?

01:56:25.573 --> 01:56:29.146
I told you to be careful
until the wedding!

01:56:30.745 --> 01:56:35.626
Oh my god, you used half!
This is expensive!

01:56:36.584 --> 01:56:37.995
But it's so good...

01:56:40.855 --> 01:56:42.129
I'm hungry-

01:56:45.193 --> 01:56:48.868
I thought I was fated
to be a doctor's wife...

01:56:49.297 --> 01:56:51.903
Why did you come?
Tell me.

01:56:52.567 --> 01:56:53.266
So sweet.

01:56:53.267 --> 01:56:54.974
- Why're you here?!
- Jesus!

01:56:55.069 --> 01:56:56.241
I'm gonna go deaf!

01:56:56.437 --> 01:56:58.678
I missed you!
I came for you!

01:56:58.906 --> 01:56:59.941
Happy?!

01:57:05.079 --> 01:57:09.528
Do you like that I was
off to meet his parents?

01:57:11.352 --> 01:57:14.492
You kept pressing Like button.
Why do you like it?

01:57:14.956 --> 01:57:17.835
Were you really happy
to send me off

01:57:18.159 --> 01:57:19.661
and get rid of me?

01:57:22.597 --> 01:57:24.167
There was no 'Dislike' button.

01:57:32.774 --> 01:57:33.809
Ju-ran...

01:57:46.421 --> 01:57:48.121
I can't, I can't.
I'll do it tomorrow.

01:57:48.122 --> 01:57:49.328
Tomorrow.

01:57:50.224 --> 01:57:52.500
Forget it! I won't!

01:58:15.116 --> 01:58:19.030
You're Roh Spring now,
Roh Spring.

01:58:22.290 --> 01:58:23.894
What'll you do now?

01:58:25.827 --> 01:58:29.138
Pay the penalty and then...

01:58:29.397 --> 01:58:30.397
Who knows.

01:58:32.700 --> 01:58:33.576
Daddy.

01:58:33.701 --> 01:58:36.181
Daddy?
You said 'daddy'?

01:58:37.105 --> 01:58:39.773
My son is a genius like me!

01:58:39.774 --> 01:58:41.082
Of course not, you fool.

01:58:41.876 --> 01:58:46.484
Don't call me that,
not in front of him.

01:58:46.814 --> 01:58:48.225
How else would I
make fun of you?

01:58:50.218 --> 01:58:51.891
We can discuss that later.

01:58:53.421 --> 01:58:55.492
- Jin-woo.
- Yes?

01:58:56.057 --> 01:58:59.937
I'm glad you're his dad.

01:59:05.666 --> 01:59:07.202
That's so cheesy.

01:59:07.335 --> 01:59:09.008
A little bit.

01:59:09.637 --> 01:59:10.877
But I'm moved!

01:59:14.008 --> 01:59:16.045
Aren't you glad
I'm your dad too?

01:59:16.644 --> 01:59:19.420
LIKE FOR LIKES

01:59:20.414 --> 01:59:21.722
Sing for me.

01:59:21.983 --> 01:59:24.054
You sing way better
than Sung Si-kyung.

01:59:24.886 --> 01:59:26.695
That's such a load of crap.

01:59:26.787 --> 01:59:28.198
I'm serious!

01:59:28.422 --> 01:59:31.062
I'm gonna bother you
until you do.

01:59:34.328 --> 01:59:35.966
My drink!
I'll spill it!

01:59:40.468 --> 01:59:41.572
Hi.

01:59:42.136 --> 01:59:43.274
You traitor!

01:59:43.604 --> 01:59:46.744
I heard you can talk!
You lied to me!

01:59:48.476 --> 01:59:50.251
Sorry, sorry.
As you were.

01:59:50.478 --> 01:59:51.479
Let's go, EJ.

01:59:52.513 --> 01:59:55.722
I'm going to London
and no gift for you!

01:59:56.450 --> 01:59:58.430
- EJ!
- Liar!

01:59:59.287 --> 02:00:00.698
Have a great trip!

02:00:06.427 --> 02:00:08.703
- Welcome.
- Hey, Jae-byung.

02:00:09.363 --> 02:00:12.105
Sweetie! Food!

02:00:12.433 --> 02:00:14.276
Oh hey.
One sec.

02:00:16.337 --> 02:00:17.941
Here it comes.

02:00:19.307 --> 02:00:20.307
You must be starved.

02:00:21.876 --> 02:00:22.876
Try it.

02:00:27.448 --> 02:00:28.448
Did you quit?

02:00:30.218 --> 02:00:32.095
It's so good!

02:00:32.286 --> 02:00:34.562
I told you to quit,
why won't you listen?

02:00:34.755 --> 02:00:38.601
Then what? This tiny place
can't support us both.

02:00:38.793 --> 02:00:39.893
You don't even own a home.

02:00:39.894 --> 02:00:41.999
I'll pay the mortgage!

02:00:42.096 --> 02:00:45.077
- When?!
- You don't believe me?

02:00:46.434 --> 02:00:47.434
This is amazing.

02:00:48.035 --> 02:00:48.672
Have plenty.

02:00:48.736 --> 02:00:50.374
Here, taste this eel.

02:00:53.941 --> 02:00:54.674
I feel invigorated!
Revitalized!

02:00:54.675 --> 02:00:56.476
Yeah? Really?
Have some more.

02:00:56.477 --> 02:00:57.477
More!

02:01:09.090 --> 02:01:10.090
Cut!

02:01:10.992 --> 02:01:11.993
Roh Jin-woo.

02:01:13.094 --> 02:01:15.904
If you can't act,
at least get the stunt right.

02:01:15.963 --> 02:01:18.034
This is why people are
criticizing my series.

02:01:18.766 --> 02:01:20.575
That was fine.

02:01:21.235 --> 02:01:24.011
Jin-woo, it was great,

02:01:24.605 --> 02:01:26.585
but let's swing
a bit more realistically.

02:01:26.807 --> 02:01:28.514
Realistically, how?

02:01:29.176 --> 02:01:31.019
That was just right.

02:01:31.445 --> 02:01:33.948
Yeah, that was.

02:01:34.849 --> 02:01:35.953
Let's try it.

02:01:38.219 --> 02:01:39.926
Fine, one more take!

02:01:42.490 --> 02:01:44.333
Let's start from the end.

02:01:45.459 --> 02:01:46.836
Just one more!

02:01:47.895 --> 02:01:49.875
Daddy's pretty cool today.

02:01:54.168 --> 02:01:55.977
Here we go,
shoot! Ready!

02:01:56.470 --> 02:01:57.470
Camera rolling!

02:02:00.074 --> 02:02:01.212
Cut 3,take 2!

02:02:03.110 --> 02:02:04.110
Action!

02:02:05.305 --> 02:02:11.801
