WEBVTT

00:10.836 --> 00:12.577
<i>The Whipple procedure.</i>

00:12.621 --> 00:15.145
<i>The DeBakey clamp.</i>

00:15.189 --> 00:18.801
<i>So many of the tools we use</i>
<i>in our hospitals every day</i>

00:18.844 --> 00:20.846
<i>are named after the people</i>
<i>who invented them.</i>

00:22.587 --> 00:24.241
<i>Even diseases</i>
<i>used to be named after</i>

00:24.285 --> 00:25.721
<i>the people</i>
<i>who discovered them.</i>

00:27.984 --> 00:29.812
<i>But a medical board</i>
<i>in the 1970s</i>

00:29.855 --> 00:31.553
<i>discontinued that practice...</i>

00:33.685 --> 00:35.513
<i>...claiming that</i>
<i>no one could "own" a sickness.</i>

00:42.390 --> 00:44.653
<i>As altruistic</i>
<i>as the profession is,</i>

00:44.696 --> 00:45.958
<i>doctors are human.</i>

00:51.268 --> 00:52.356
Game Day.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.054
You ready?

00:54.097 --> 00:55.838
I was ready
the first time.

00:55.881 --> 00:57.753
<i>If we do something that could</i>
<i>change the face of medicine,</i>

00:57.796 --> 00:59.015
<i>we want our name on it.</i>

01:10.113 --> 01:11.593
Hey.

01:11.636 --> 01:14.030
Hey, Amelia said
you'd already gone.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.597
I went for a hike.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.816
That's...different.

01:17.860 --> 01:19.166
Yeah, well, you know,
the silence,

01:19.209 --> 01:21.211
the fresh air,
it clears my head.

01:21.255 --> 01:22.386
I need to clear my head.

01:22.430 --> 01:23.866
Before the big
groundbreaking surgery

01:23.909 --> 01:25.824
that none of us can watch?

01:25.868 --> 01:27.478
It's fine.
You go make history.

01:27.522 --> 01:28.610
I'll get the kids
to school.

01:28.653 --> 01:30.133
Well, someday
you'll make history,

01:30.177 --> 01:32.831
and I'll watch your kids
and we'll be even.

01:32.875 --> 01:35.095
<i>Unusable.</i>
<i>Completely unusable.</i>

01:35.138 --> 01:36.531
Zola's watching
the Whipple tape.

01:36.574 --> 01:38.402
Again?

01:38.446 --> 01:41.231
<i>Change of plans.</i>
<i>Suction here.</i>

01:41.275 --> 01:42.885
Hi. <i>Retract that, please.</i>

01:42.928 --> 01:44.626
<i>Clamp.</i> Zola: She was great,
wasn't she?

01:44.669 --> 01:45.670
She was.

01:45.714 --> 01:46.889
Not as good as you.

01:46.932 --> 01:48.630
You better
go get ready for school.

01:51.720 --> 01:54.331
- Hi.
- <i>Hi. So it looks like</i>
<i>I'm not gonna be able</i>

01:54.375 --> 01:56.420
to make it down to Seattle
for your big day.

01:56.464 --> 01:58.205
- I'm sorry.
- Did I invite you?

01:58.248 --> 02:01.251
True. I'd probably just be
a big distraction.

02:01.295 --> 02:03.340
You know, these eyes
looking down at you

02:03.384 --> 02:04.950
<i>from the OR gallery as</i>
<i>you try to focus on Hamilton.</i>

02:04.994 --> 02:07.388
I understand. <i> A little full of ourselves,</i>
<i>aren't we?</i>

02:07.431 --> 02:09.041
Not unlike my patient.

02:09.085 --> 02:10.347
No, I'm headed in
to see a patient

02:10.391 --> 02:11.783
with end-stage
liver disease.

02:11.827 --> 02:13.698
Primary sclerosing
cholangitis.

02:13.742 --> 02:15.787
<i>He's been waiting on a liver </i>
<i> and he was starting to give up,</i>

02:15.831 --> 02:17.180
<i>but then -- plot twist --</i>

02:17.224 --> 02:19.487
storm dumps eight inches
up in Bemidji last night,

02:19.530 --> 02:22.011
teenager hits a patch
of black ice and...

02:22.054 --> 02:23.752
well, that's not
the <i>fun</i> part of the story,

02:23.795 --> 02:25.101
<i>but my guy's getting</i>
<i>a new liver.</i>

02:25.145 --> 02:27.147
Mm,
bittersweet congratulations.

02:27.190 --> 02:28.496
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>Arthur's a sweet kid.</i>

02:28.539 --> 02:30.628
Good luck today.
Send me pictures?

02:30.672 --> 02:32.064
O-Of the surgery.

02:32.108 --> 02:33.327
Doc pics.

02:33.370 --> 02:34.980
<i>Doctor pictures.</i>
<i>You know what I mean.</i>

02:35.024 --> 02:36.939
I'll see ya.
Bye.

02:39.507 --> 02:41.378
Morning.

02:41.422 --> 02:43.119
Oh, you changed
your hair.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.251
I did.

02:44.294 --> 02:45.600
It was obviously
a mistake,

02:45.643 --> 02:48.603
so I pulled myself together
and fixed the mistake.

02:48.646 --> 02:50.779
Oh, well,
this looks nice, too.

02:52.302 --> 02:54.391
- Long night?
- Placenta previa,

02:54.435 --> 02:57.394
which wound up a C-section
at 4:45 a.m.

02:57.438 --> 02:59.091
Mother and baby
are doing great.

02:59.135 --> 03:00.919
The OB resident
is fully wiped.

03:00.963 --> 03:03.313
You've been working
a lot of nights lately.

03:03.357 --> 03:05.272
A lot of babies
- come at night.
- Yeah, of course.

03:05.315 --> 03:07.274
It's just -- You're not
avoiding me, are you?

03:07.317 --> 03:09.537
No!
Are you avoiding me?

03:09.580 --> 03:10.625
Not at all.

03:10.668 --> 03:12.148
Okay.
Great.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.802
Okay, I'm gonna go
and order

03:13.845 --> 03:15.760
the greasiest egg sandwich
they have at Joe's

03:15.804 --> 03:17.675
and then go nap at home

03:17.719 --> 03:18.546
and then come get Luna.

03:18.589 --> 03:19.764
I'll get Luna.

03:19.808 --> 03:21.244
Oh, okay.

03:21.288 --> 03:22.245
Great.

03:22.289 --> 03:23.246
Thanks.

03:23.290 --> 03:25.553
- Okay.
- Sounds good.

03:25.596 --> 03:27.337
Everything's good.

03:27.381 --> 03:31.733
Yeah, I understand,
and I am absolutely flattered,

03:31.776 --> 03:33.387
and I-I'll let you know.

03:33.430 --> 03:35.258
Okay.

03:35.302 --> 03:37.565
Huh? They finally restocked
on the unsweetened almond milk

03:37.608 --> 03:39.871
after I gave them
a little nudge yesterday.

03:39.915 --> 03:42.265
You're
the only one who cares.

03:42.309 --> 03:43.832
Now walk with me.

03:43.875 --> 03:45.225
Everything okay, Chief?

03:45.268 --> 03:47.618
A med school friend
just called.

03:47.662 --> 03:49.272
I haven't spoken to him
in months,

03:49.316 --> 03:53.755
but he works with NASA, at the
Aerospace Medicine Fellowship.

03:53.798 --> 03:55.322
They do research --

03:55.365 --> 03:57.976
On innovative devices designed
to identify and combat

03:58.020 --> 04:00.849
spacial disorientation
and vestibular abnormalities?

04:00.892 --> 04:02.329
Of course
you would know that.

04:02.372 --> 04:05.201
I-I just read a paper about
how they've received funding

04:05.245 --> 04:07.116
to start new oxygen-delivery
- systems on aircrafts.
- Yeah.

04:07.159 --> 04:08.509
In aircrafts.
Yes!

04:08.552 --> 04:11.773
Yeah, it's a program
that combines the two things

04:11.816 --> 04:14.254
I've dreamt about
my entire life --

04:14.297 --> 04:16.647
medicine and space.

04:16.691 --> 04:19.737
And at the worst possible time
in my life,

04:19.781 --> 04:23.132
I've been asked to run
their clinical training.

04:23.175 --> 04:24.916
W-Wait. Hold on, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.744
Chief --
Chief Bailey, you --

04:26.788 --> 04:28.920
you just got an offer
to go to space.

04:32.054 --> 04:33.925
I mean, just when I thought you
couldn't get any more amazing,

04:33.969 --> 04:36.841
you go and break
the stratosphere?

04:36.885 --> 04:38.843
I did do that, didn't I?

04:43.021 --> 04:45.937
Pre-op labs, EKG, CXR --
all clear.

04:45.981 --> 04:47.635
Abdominal incision
is healing nicely

04:47.678 --> 04:48.679
without signs of infection.

04:48.723 --> 04:50.420
Pre-op MRI scans are done

04:50.464 --> 04:51.987
and ready to upload
to the robot.

04:52.030 --> 04:53.815
Cell vials are all within
the temperature range.

04:53.858 --> 04:55.469
Watching the team
come together

04:55.512 --> 04:57.297
to realize
my remarkable vision,

04:57.340 --> 04:59.951
I'm humbled
by how far we've come since --

04:59.995 --> 05:01.431
What are you doing?
What -- What is this?

05:01.475 --> 05:03.346
- Oh, it's for my book.
- What book?

05:03.390 --> 05:05.261
How do you think history books
are written?

05:05.305 --> 05:07.742
Someone makes a record
for posterity.

05:07.785 --> 05:10.135
We will. Myself,
Dr. Shepherd, Dr. Bartley --

05:10.179 --> 05:12.181
we will publish
in medical journals.

05:12.224 --> 05:16.141
And congratulations, you will be
in there as Patient X.

05:16.185 --> 05:19.231
Is there a bigger room available
to accommodate all these egos?

05:20.624 --> 05:24.106
Despite how you have treated me
and the entire team,

05:24.149 --> 05:27.022
I'm still here,
as I was 11 days ago

05:27.065 --> 05:28.980
when your arrogance
and dishonesty

05:29.024 --> 05:31.809
nearly sank
the entire project.

05:32.636 --> 05:34.812
Let's make sure
they're ready upstairs.

05:56.225 --> 05:58.358
Oh, your -- your --
your mother let me in.

06:01.839 --> 06:04.015
I thought
that you and I could talk.

06:13.895 --> 06:15.505
Every time I close my eyes,

06:15.549 --> 06:18.421
I see blood pouring
out of Devon's body

06:18.465 --> 06:21.511
while hearing his voice
inside my head.

06:22.773 --> 06:24.471
I don't mean to be rude,
Dr. Webber,

06:24.514 --> 06:25.994
but talking about it
doesn't help me.

06:26.037 --> 06:27.604
This game helps me.

06:47.929 --> 06:50.410
- Listen, no.
- It's okay.
If we can just get it done,

06:50.453 --> 06:52.063
- it -- it'll be over quickly.
- No.

06:52.107 --> 06:53.587
Look, your muscles will atrophy
if you don't mobilize them.

06:53.630 --> 06:55.153
I can do this on my own.
I need to start my gym routine.

06:55.197 --> 06:57.025
I've had PT much more strenuous
than this.

06:57.068 --> 06:58.722
You know what?
I can take it from here.

06:58.766 --> 07:01.464
Wound check.
Thanks so much, Eric.

07:01.508 --> 07:02.987
I need someone else.

07:03.031 --> 07:05.294
You've had three different
physical therapists in 10 days.

07:05.337 --> 07:08.123
There's a rumor
you made one cry.

07:08.166 --> 07:10.125
Link, all day, I see people
go past that door,

07:10.168 --> 07:11.561
patients that
I could be helping.

07:11.605 --> 07:13.998
All night, I hear rigs
pulling up outside.

07:14.042 --> 07:16.131
It's torture.

07:16.174 --> 07:17.437
I haven't even graduated
to the treadmill.

07:17.480 --> 07:18.960
You know how you graduate
to the treadmill?

07:19.003 --> 07:20.048
You put in the hours.

07:20.091 --> 07:21.092
I'm trying to,
I just --

07:21.136 --> 07:22.485
No, you either cancel
your sessions

07:22.529 --> 07:24.052
or you yell at the people
leading them.

07:24.095 --> 07:26.620
A solid support system is a
major factor in patient outcome,

07:26.663 --> 07:28.752
especially in long rehabs.

07:28.796 --> 07:30.841
Is Teddy coming by soon,
or...

07:30.885 --> 07:32.321
I'm not sure.

07:33.409 --> 07:36.107
Okay.

07:36.151 --> 07:38.632
Alright, Hunt,
in the chair now.

07:39.676 --> 07:40.677
Let's go.

07:52.559 --> 07:55.126
I had my own Devon.

07:56.867 --> 07:58.565
So I know exactly
what you're feeling.

08:00.044 --> 08:01.916
My patient was
Chuck Higgins --

08:01.959 --> 08:03.265
cannery worker.

08:03.308 --> 08:06.094
We met when my wife Adele
made me go on

08:06.137 --> 08:08.618
a food-and-blanket drive
for homeless people

08:08.662 --> 08:10.141
that he organized.

08:11.491 --> 08:15.886
Guy with a big heart,
terrible card player,

08:15.930 --> 08:17.801
great taste in music.

08:17.845 --> 08:20.151
One day, he came in
for a bowel obstruction.

08:20.195 --> 08:21.631
He didn't like hospitals.

08:21.675 --> 08:23.981
I remember the fear
in his eyes

08:24.025 --> 08:26.375
when he was told
that he needed surgery.

08:26.418 --> 08:28.464
But when I told him
that I would do it,

08:28.508 --> 08:29.639
the fear went away.

08:31.249 --> 08:35.036
He told me how comforting it was
to see me,

08:35.079 --> 08:38.039
someone who looked like him,
in a white coat.

08:38.082 --> 08:40.389
Three hours later,
there was a horrible error

08:40.432 --> 08:42.173
in communications
in the OR,

08:42.217 --> 08:43.566
and as a young attending,

08:43.610 --> 08:46.569
I was too inexperienced
and timid to speak up and...

08:46.613 --> 08:49.964
And you killed him
like I killed Devon.

08:51.574 --> 08:54.403
We all kill people.

08:54.446 --> 08:57.972
Schmitt, we don't always
kill people we feel close to,

08:58.015 --> 09:01.062
like you felt with Devon,
like I felt with Chuck.

09:01.105 --> 09:03.238
It makes the loss
unbearably worse.

09:05.632 --> 09:08.722
And it's not even his death
that haunts me.

09:08.765 --> 09:10.550
It's the relief
in that man's eyes

09:10.593 --> 09:12.552
when he saw
that I was his surgeon,

09:12.595 --> 09:14.162
the trust
that he put in me.

09:14.205 --> 09:16.860
That's what stays with me,

09:16.904 --> 09:18.122
even today.

09:19.210 --> 09:21.343
He thought
I would take care of him...

09:21.386 --> 09:22.692
and I didn't.

09:40.536 --> 09:42.146
Order for Wilson?

09:42.190 --> 09:44.148
- Yep, let me check.
- Okay.

09:46.716 --> 09:47.891
Hey.

09:50.328 --> 09:52.504
I haven't had a day off
in 35 days,

09:52.548 --> 09:54.245
and I was on all night.

09:54.289 --> 09:56.030
My kids are with
my mother-in-law and I'm just --

09:56.073 --> 09:59.076
I'm going through some --
some stuff.

10:00.687 --> 10:01.644
You want company?

10:01.688 --> 10:02.906
No judging?

10:02.950 --> 10:04.908
As long
as it goes both ways.

10:04.952 --> 10:06.344
We're day-drinking.

10:09.478 --> 10:12.220
Alright, first step --

10:12.263 --> 10:14.614
we are ditching
the hospital gown.

10:14.657 --> 10:16.354
I don't understand.

10:16.398 --> 10:18.313
Well, the gown makes you feel
like you belong in bed.

10:18.356 --> 10:20.881
As professional as I am,

10:20.924 --> 10:22.796
I don't need to see anything
falling out of this gown.

10:23.884 --> 10:25.625
Put these on.
They're mine.

10:25.668 --> 10:26.669
These don't look clean.

10:26.713 --> 10:28.062
They're clean enough.

10:28.105 --> 10:29.585
I'm not sure
we're the same size, okay?

10:29.629 --> 10:30.891
Listen, isn't there somebody
in Seattle

10:30.934 --> 10:33.676
who has a broken bone
or a twisted ankle?

10:33.720 --> 10:35.330
Okay, I don't know what's
going on with you and Teddy.

10:35.373 --> 10:37.071
It's none of my business,
but I just repaired

10:37.114 --> 10:39.247
your tibial plateau fracture
beautifully,

10:39.290 --> 10:41.336
and I refuse to see my hard work
go to waste.

10:41.379 --> 10:43.077
So put on the clothes.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.731
I'm not sure gym clothes
are gonna help, okay?

10:44.774 --> 10:45.906
People I've worked with
for years,

10:45.949 --> 10:46.907
they see me
in this chair now,

10:46.950 --> 10:48.691
and they just walk
right by.

10:48.735 --> 10:49.866
They've written me off
as a surgeon.

10:51.085 --> 10:52.303
Alright,
you want to get stronger,

10:52.347 --> 10:53.914
you got to change the way
you are thinking.

10:53.957 --> 10:58.048
Starting now, you are no longer
a patient in a hospital gown.

10:58.092 --> 11:00.616
You are a world-class athlete
on the injured reserve list.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.924
You are rehabbing, okay?

11:03.967 --> 11:07.667
So stop pitying yourself --
get back on the field.

11:11.235 --> 11:12.323
Woman over PA:
<i> Dr. Park to Labor and Delivery.</i>

11:12.367 --> 11:14.369
Duda, Arthur.

11:14.412 --> 11:15.587
Hello.

11:15.631 --> 11:17.589
How we feeling?
Any nausea, fever, chills

11:17.633 --> 11:18.590
in the last 24 hours?

11:18.634 --> 11:19.940
Nope.

11:19.983 --> 11:21.332
Haven't even thrown up
in a couple days.

11:21.376 --> 11:23.465
Oh, hey, that's great.

11:23.508 --> 11:25.206
Yeah, I'm thinking about using
that as my new pick-up line.

11:25.249 --> 11:27.556
Okay, well,
sense of humor's still there.

11:27.599 --> 11:28.905
That's good -- check.

11:28.949 --> 11:30.559
Uh, new <i>SLAM</i> magazine.

11:30.602 --> 11:31.908
Nice article on the Wolves
in there.

11:31.952 --> 11:33.040
I don't know if, uh --

11:33.083 --> 11:34.737
if Edwards and KAT
can stay healthy,

11:34.781 --> 11:38.393
we might have a good chance of
making the playoffs this year.

11:38.436 --> 11:39.873
What do you think about going
to a game sometime?

11:39.916 --> 11:40.874
I'm down.

11:40.917 --> 11:43.093
Okay, good.
Can we not?

11:43.137 --> 11:46.531
It's hard enough
without the false hope.

11:46.575 --> 11:47.924
His numbers
have been terrible.

11:47.968 --> 11:50.535
Mom, it's just fun
to think about, okay?

11:50.579 --> 11:51.972
Look, hey, hey, hey.

11:52.015 --> 11:53.582
I know that the wait
has been hell,

11:53.625 --> 11:56.541
but I'm still here.

11:56.585 --> 11:58.326
I'm still in this.
Okay?

11:58.369 --> 12:00.241
I mean, look,
do you blame her?

12:00.284 --> 12:03.374
This is, what, Day 137
on the transplant list?

12:03.418 --> 12:05.115
Of course you would know
the exact number, geez.

12:05.159 --> 12:06.421
You'd be surprised.

12:06.464 --> 12:09.380
Yesterday,
did I know it was Day 136?

12:09.424 --> 12:11.469
I didn't.

12:11.513 --> 12:13.471
But today's different.

12:13.515 --> 12:16.866
I mean, you always remember
the day you get your new liver.

12:19.564 --> 12:21.262
- What?
- That's right.
Dr. Marsh.

12:21.305 --> 12:22.524
Wait, what?

12:22.567 --> 12:25.396
Arthur, you are getting
a new liver today.

12:25.440 --> 12:26.702
I'm off with the team
to pick it up.

12:26.746 --> 12:27.877
In the meantime,
you get plenty of rest.

12:27.921 --> 12:29.357
No food, no water.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.098
Happy Day 137.

12:33.274 --> 12:35.058
137?

12:40.847 --> 12:44.154
H-Hey,
have you heard from him?

12:44.198 --> 12:46.113
Oh, come on, you know
how stubborn Richard can be.

12:46.156 --> 12:48.637
Okay, he just can't take off
as he pleases.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.726
So I'm down
yet another surgeon

12:50.770 --> 12:52.293
right when I was offered
the opportunity of --

12:52.336 --> 12:54.904
Oh, you have got to be
kidding me.

12:54.948 --> 12:56.819
Bailey, it's a pleasure
to see you.

12:56.863 --> 12:58.429
As a member
of the Fox Foundation,

12:58.473 --> 13:01.084
I have to say, your residents
seem mopey, overworked.

13:01.128 --> 13:03.086
Are you concerned
about, uh, burnout?

13:03.130 --> 13:04.696
We're only getting
simple procedures,

13:04.740 --> 13:06.873
which feels like punishment
for something we didn't do,

13:06.916 --> 13:08.700
and Levi's just gone.

13:08.744 --> 13:10.093
And now Dr. Webber
isn't even showing up,

13:10.137 --> 13:11.703
so we're not sure what
we're supposed to be doing.

13:11.747 --> 13:14.097
I mean, Dr. Webber still is
our residency director, right?

13:14.141 --> 13:16.404
You know, I was residency
director for a hot second once.

13:16.447 --> 13:17.492
Loved the parking space.

13:17.535 --> 13:19.581
The work? Meh.

13:19.624 --> 13:22.192
Is he here to give me
another heart attack?

13:22.236 --> 13:23.498
Uh, he's on my team.

13:23.541 --> 13:25.065
He's...

13:25.108 --> 13:27.894
And what role exactly
do you have

13:27.937 --> 13:30.331
on this groundbreaking
VIP project?

13:30.374 --> 13:32.594
Ah, see, if we told you,
we'd have to kill you.

13:32.637 --> 13:34.465
Oh, wait,
that's your resident's job.

13:35.510 --> 13:36.859
Oh, too soon.

13:36.903 --> 13:38.861
What?

13:38.905 --> 13:40.820
Mm.What?

13:42.778 --> 13:43.866
Why don't you all come
with me?

13:47.261 --> 13:48.566
Bye-bye.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.005
Hi, David.
Full disclosure,

13:52.048 --> 13:53.180
I had nothing to do
with this.

13:57.227 --> 13:59.926
You are taking a giant risk

13:59.969 --> 14:01.623
by volunteering
to be the patient here,

14:01.666 --> 14:02.972
and we can't thank you enough
for that.

14:03.016 --> 14:07.020
- Mm.
- But you are in my hospital,

14:07.063 --> 14:09.631
and in my hospital,
we teach.

14:11.502 --> 14:12.852
What are you saying?

14:12.895 --> 14:16.246
I'm saying
let's throw our egos aside,

14:16.290 --> 14:19.380
and let's open up
this historic surgery

14:19.423 --> 14:21.338
to every attending,
every resident in the hospital.

14:21.382 --> 14:22.949
And you're already
filming it,

14:22.992 --> 14:24.037
so why not share it
with the world?

14:24.080 --> 14:25.429
Why not teach the world?

14:30.347 --> 14:32.741
Okay.

14:32.784 --> 14:33.829
Thank you.

14:40.053 --> 14:42.055
Our patient
is Dr. David Hamilton,

14:42.098 --> 14:44.535
62-year-old male diagnosed
with Parkinson's disease

14:44.579 --> 14:45.885
eight years ago.

14:45.928 --> 14:48.278
He's currently
on levodopa and carbidopa

14:48.322 --> 14:50.977
and is here for a pioneering
cell therapy surgery.

15:00.508 --> 15:02.989
I haven't been to a bar
since I got Luna.

15:03.032 --> 15:06.340
I mean, I-I-I love her
so much, but --

15:06.383 --> 15:07.341
She's boring.

15:07.384 --> 15:08.951
She only likes two songs,

15:08.995 --> 15:10.518
and she doesn't want to read
any other book

15:10.561 --> 15:12.389
except
"Where's My Belly Button?"

15:12.433 --> 15:15.697
And then -- And then the diapers
and sleep regression.

15:15.740 --> 15:18.221
The rage I have
for sleep regression...

15:18.265 --> 15:19.788
Just wait till
she starts walking

15:19.831 --> 15:21.833
and you wake up to her playing
pots and pans at 3:00 a.m.

15:21.877 --> 15:24.749
No!
No, no, no, no, no.

15:24.793 --> 15:26.186
Let's make a deal.
Okay.

15:26.229 --> 15:28.057
No more saying
"I love my children, but..."

15:28.101 --> 15:29.232
We can love our kids

15:29.276 --> 15:31.495
and still need
a five-minute break

15:31.539 --> 15:32.670
and a drink.
Yes!

15:32.714 --> 15:34.281
Love this deal.

15:34.324 --> 15:36.718
Almost as much as I love
the ratio of this vodka to OJ.

15:36.761 --> 15:39.112
I just -- I couldn't go home
to Allison and Leo this morning.

15:39.155 --> 15:41.201
I couldn't walk in the door
and hug them

15:41.244 --> 15:43.986
and tell them everything
is okay another time.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.988
I just -- I'm...

15:46.032 --> 15:48.295
I'm exhausted from it.

15:48.338 --> 15:51.559
I am exhausted from lying,

15:51.602 --> 15:52.908
I mean,
but they're children,

15:52.952 --> 15:54.779
and we have to lie
to children

15:54.823 --> 15:57.782
because they can't know
all of the horrible thoughts

15:57.826 --> 16:00.089
that are going on
inside our heads.

16:00.133 --> 16:01.308
Are you okay?

16:01.351 --> 16:02.962
No.

16:03.005 --> 16:04.354
I'm -- I'm gonna get
another drink,

16:04.398 --> 16:07.140
and I'm gonna play darts,

16:07.183 --> 16:08.706
'cause throwing sharp objects
at something

16:08.750 --> 16:09.925
sounds really good.

16:12.536 --> 16:14.016
Too much pressure.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.583
10 more seconds.

16:15.626 --> 16:17.367
It hurts because you've been
in a bed for almost two weeks.

16:17.411 --> 16:20.327
It hurts because I was in a car
that somersaulted down a ravine.

16:23.547 --> 16:24.896
Hypothetical --
you're with someone,

16:24.940 --> 16:26.855
and they know you
completely,

16:26.898 --> 16:29.423
despite everything
and everyone you've done.

16:29.466 --> 16:31.729
And it's great
until suddenly,

16:31.773 --> 16:32.992
they don't even want to be
in the same room as you.

16:33.035 --> 16:33.905
I really don't want
to talk about Teddy.

16:33.949 --> 16:35.124
No, neither do I.

16:35.168 --> 16:37.997
Wait, I thought
you and Amelia were done.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.086
Uh...we are.

16:40.129 --> 16:41.522
Okay, I'm confused.

16:41.565 --> 16:42.610
Trust me, so am I.

16:44.438 --> 16:46.048
Woman over PA:
<i>Dr. Bowman to Cardiology.</i>

16:46.092 --> 16:48.616
<i>Dr. Bowman to Cardiology.</i>

16:51.401 --> 16:53.534
Heads up, when you get
your organ, head out the back.

16:53.577 --> 16:55.231
Grieving family
just arrived --

16:55.275 --> 16:57.494
nothing worse than
having to walk that gauntlet.

16:57.538 --> 16:59.322
Got it. Thank you.

17:01.759 --> 17:03.718
I'm gonna take
a quick walk.

17:03.761 --> 17:04.762
Let me know
when we're up, okay?

17:04.806 --> 17:06.025
Sure.
Okay.

17:11.378 --> 17:13.467
Okay, Helm,
how do we get the cells

17:13.510 --> 17:15.425
that we inject
into the patient's brain?

17:17.079 --> 17:18.254
<i>From his skin?</i>

17:18.298 --> 17:19.603
That is vaguely not wrong.

17:19.647 --> 17:22.911
We take stem cells
from a skin biopsy,

17:22.954 --> 17:25.827
and then we reprogram them
through a complex process,

17:25.870 --> 17:28.047
and then differentiate them
into dopamine-producing cells.

17:28.090 --> 17:29.874
And by injecting them
into the forebrain,

17:29.918 --> 17:32.573
<i>we are hoping to improve</i>
<i>the dopamine levels</i>

17:32.616 --> 17:34.923
<i>that decreases in patients</i>
<i>with Parkinson's.</i> Koracick: <i>What else?</i>

17:34.966 --> 17:36.925
C'mon, there's no such thing
as a stupid question.

17:36.968 --> 17:38.927
Just a stupid resident
who asks it.

17:41.408 --> 17:43.366
Dr. Bartley is the one
who perfected

17:43.410 --> 17:44.933
the injection technique.

17:47.196 --> 17:49.285
Would you like to say
a few words, Dr. Bartley?

17:54.899 --> 17:55.857
Mm.

17:57.554 --> 18:01.906
In order to maximize
surface area volume ratio

18:01.950 --> 18:05.606
and avoid cell death from
lack of access to nutrients,

18:05.649 --> 18:08.739
we created an injector
that could evenly distribute

18:08.783 --> 18:11.351
the cells
along a cylindrical track,

18:11.394 --> 18:14.789
which gives about
a 30% improvement

18:14.832 --> 18:16.965
<i> in survival of the cells.</i>

18:17.008 --> 18:18.140
<i>Yeah, that's all.</i>

18:18.184 --> 18:19.576
Thank you.

18:23.493 --> 18:25.104
I chose research
for a reason.

18:25.147 --> 18:27.715
Mice are more forgiving
than students. And cuter.

18:27.758 --> 18:29.760
- You were charming.
- Well, and
you're a horrible liar.

18:29.804 --> 18:31.980
Meredith:
Thank you, Dr. Bartley.
That was very informative.

18:32.023 --> 18:35.026
<i>Now, please take your seats,</i>
<i>and we can get started.</i>

18:35.070 --> 18:36.854
Are we sure all these people
even work here?

18:38.029 --> 18:39.292
Oh, boy.

18:39.335 --> 18:41.685
- Um, hey, excuse me.
- Oh, wow.

18:41.729 --> 18:43.078
- Excuse me.
- Oh, my gosh.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.775
- Excuse me.
- Hi, hi. Excuse us.

18:44.819 --> 18:46.125
- I'm with them.
- Excuse me.

18:46.168 --> 18:47.561
Excu--

18:47.604 --> 18:49.737
Oh. Okay, uh, we've set up
a video feed

18:49.780 --> 18:51.956
in the west lobby
for overflow.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.220
I'm not asking.

18:55.482 --> 18:56.744
Thank you.

18:56.787 --> 18:57.962
- Thanks.
- Appreciate it.

18:58.006 --> 18:59.355
- Nice. Good.
- Hey. Come on, come on.

18:59.399 --> 19:01.183
Oh, excuse me.

19:01.227 --> 19:04.230
Whoa, i-- is that
a robotic micro-injector?

19:04.273 --> 19:08.364
Hmm. Looks like a Da Vinci
- married C-3
- PO.

19:08.408 --> 19:09.670
You think?

19:09.713 --> 19:11.541
It looks a little more
like Johnny 5 to me.

19:11.585 --> 19:12.934
G-Genius.
Mm-hmm.

19:12.977 --> 19:14.892
Yeah, the --
the little circle things

19:14.936 --> 19:17.156
- could be the eyes.
- Could be the eyes,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:17.199 --> 19:18.722
You like robots,
Dr. Pierce?

19:18.766 --> 19:20.594
I like Wall-E.

19:23.597 --> 19:25.381
Uh, you know
who also has robots, huh?

19:25.425 --> 19:26.208
Hmm?

19:26.252 --> 19:27.731
NASA.

19:40.266 --> 19:41.397
Hi.

19:43.007 --> 19:46.010
My name's Dr. Nick Marsh.

19:46.054 --> 19:47.577
I'm here to recover
your son's liver

19:47.621 --> 19:48.796
for a transplant patient.

19:54.105 --> 19:55.933
I just wanted to come over
and tell you

19:55.977 --> 19:57.892
how sorry I am
for your loss.

19:59.633 --> 20:01.243
Thank you.
Mm.

20:01.287 --> 20:02.984
James.

20:03.027 --> 20:04.594
His name is James.

20:04.638 --> 20:05.769
James.

20:05.813 --> 20:08.076
Okay.

20:08.119 --> 20:09.686
I know
this might sound strange,

20:09.730 --> 20:12.863
but is -- is there anything
you'd like to share about James?

20:16.215 --> 20:19.174
He was always singing.

20:19.218 --> 20:22.177
His first words were sung,

20:22.221 --> 20:23.265
not spoken.

20:24.745 --> 20:26.312
And the voice was so...

20:28.183 --> 20:29.445
...powerful.

20:32.100 --> 20:34.015
You could hear him
two streets over.

20:34.058 --> 20:37.366
I, uh --
I-I always thought

20:37.410 --> 20:38.585
he'd be a rock star,

20:38.628 --> 20:40.543
but he liked opera,

20:40.587 --> 20:41.849
and whenever my friends
were over,

20:41.892 --> 20:43.546
he would sing it
so loud

20:43.590 --> 20:46.332
and I'd get so embarrassed,
and I'd tell him to shut up.

20:47.985 --> 20:50.336
It's okay. It's okay.

20:54.253 --> 20:58.648
And then when he auditioned for
the San Francisco Conservatory,

20:58.692 --> 21:00.346
uh, he asked me
to drive down with him

21:00.389 --> 21:02.478
so he could practice
his aria,

21:02.522 --> 21:04.350
the "Una furtiva lagrima."

21:05.438 --> 21:07.091
He was so good.

21:08.441 --> 21:10.007
And I was so proud
of him.

21:10.051 --> 21:11.879
Yeah.
Thank you for sharing that.

21:11.922 --> 21:13.402
I really appreciate it.

21:16.144 --> 21:17.145
Dr. Marsh.

21:17.188 --> 21:18.233
Yeah.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.234
They're ready for you.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.410
Okay.
I'll be right in.

21:27.460 --> 21:28.287
Thank you.

21:30.376 --> 21:33.292
I'll be thinking about James
when I operate today.

21:43.258 --> 21:45.042
Okay, the --
the aliens attacked and --

21:45.086 --> 21:46.522
and blew up your universe

21:46.566 --> 21:49.482
and left you nothing
for the third time?

21:49.525 --> 21:51.832
Y-You don't get bored?

21:51.875 --> 21:53.312
You're stuck
in this endless loop

21:53.355 --> 21:55.444
without ever
achieving anything?

21:55.488 --> 21:56.750
In the time I've sat here,

21:56.793 --> 21:59.709
you were killed by aliens
who you left behind.

21:59.753 --> 22:02.059
You found a map
to their home planet,

22:02.103 --> 22:03.670
but exploded in a trap,

22:03.713 --> 22:06.281
and you didn't even inspect
the plans to build the --

22:06.325 --> 22:08.327
the space thing
with the solar shields,

22:08.370 --> 22:10.981
which, quite frankly,
is driving me mad.

22:11.025 --> 22:12.548
And I'm just not sure
I get the point

22:12.592 --> 22:14.942
of playing something
where you die over and over.

22:17.423 --> 22:19.207
Because you learn
from it.

22:19.250 --> 22:22.515
You use what you learn
before each death.

22:22.558 --> 22:27.520
No matter how many times you die
or how many other people die,

22:27.563 --> 22:29.391
you always get a do-over.

22:34.918 --> 22:35.919
Nice work.

22:37.138 --> 22:38.705
Give me 20 more.
Wait, what?

22:38.748 --> 22:39.880
I'm kidding. We're done.

22:41.142 --> 22:42.665
Alright,
let's get you up, slowly.

22:42.709 --> 22:44.145
Yeah.

22:44.188 --> 22:46.930
You and Altman
were friends first, right?

22:46.974 --> 22:48.497
Yeah.
How long did it take
to change?

22:48.541 --> 22:49.716
I don't know, 20 years.

22:50.499 --> 22:51.848
Right.

22:51.892 --> 22:53.110
Was it awkward
when you, uh --

22:53.154 --> 22:55.809
Ow!

22:55.852 --> 22:56.592
What's wrong, you dizzy?

22:56.636 --> 22:57.854
Ow.

22:57.898 --> 22:58.899
A shooting pain right --
Ow! --

22:58.942 --> 22:59.900
right behind the eye.

22:59.943 --> 23:00.727
Alright,
let's lay you back down.

23:00.770 --> 23:02.163
Yeah.

23:02.206 --> 23:03.599
Oh, it feels better
when I lay flat.

23:03.643 --> 23:04.948
Okay.

23:04.992 --> 23:06.646
Significant swelling
around the incision.

23:06.689 --> 23:09.257
- Oh, damn it.
- Alright, alright,
we're going to CT right now.

23:15.263 --> 23:17.047
I-It's something
she -- she does.

23:17.091 --> 23:19.136
Supposedly,
superhero pose --

23:19.180 --> 23:21.312
Lowers cortisol,
increases testosterone.

23:21.356 --> 23:22.575
Less stress,
more confidence.

23:22.618 --> 23:23.837
I read the study.

23:23.880 --> 23:26.013
Right.
Good for you.

23:26.056 --> 23:29.103
Personally, a long shower
does it for me.

23:29.146 --> 23:33.499
Oh, and here comes
the guest of honor.

23:33.542 --> 23:35.414
David,
how are you feeling?

23:35.457 --> 23:37.981
Like a bit player in a drama
suddenly.

23:38.025 --> 23:39.722
Well,
you can just relax.

23:39.766 --> 23:41.985
You got the finest neurosurgeon
in the country right here,

23:42.029 --> 23:43.683
and I've got Shepherd
helping out.

23:43.726 --> 23:45.249
I'm gonna go scrub.

23:45.293 --> 23:47.034
Try not to drive
the patient away till I'm back.

23:47.077 --> 23:47.861
We have issues.

23:47.904 --> 23:49.253
He won't get far.

23:52.779 --> 23:54.258
Meredith:
<i>First we position the patient</i>

23:54.302 --> 23:56.260
<i>and secure his head</i>
<i>in the base frame.</i>

24:11.493 --> 24:13.495
Okay.

24:13.539 --> 24:15.758
Ready for cold perfusion.

24:15.802 --> 24:17.368
So, we always start
dissecting the organ

24:17.412 --> 24:18.674
under normal circulation,

24:18.718 --> 24:19.893
and then we inspect
the organ

24:19.936 --> 24:21.198
before the cardiac team
comes in

24:21.242 --> 24:23.505
and takes
the heart and lungs.

24:34.168 --> 24:35.952
Pink, plump,
and perfect size.

24:35.996 --> 24:37.345
Ready to go.

24:46.572 --> 24:48.356
<i>We then perform a CT scan,</i>

24:48.399 --> 24:50.489
<i>and the robot uses the images</i>
<i>to give us</i>

24:50.532 --> 24:52.882
<i>an interactive 3-D roadmap</i>
<i>of the brain.</i>

25:10.334 --> 25:13.120
We apply a local anesthetic
and make an incision

25:13.163 --> 25:14.687
and prepare to drill
the burr holes.

25:14.730 --> 25:15.905
Koracick:
I like to think of it

25:15.949 --> 25:18.647
as creating
2/3 of a bowling ball.

25:18.691 --> 25:20.562
That is not at all
what it's like.

25:26.916 --> 25:28.004
Finished removing
the heart and lung.

25:28.048 --> 25:29.440
Liver's all yours.

25:29.484 --> 25:32.052
Dr. Shepherd
will direct the robotic arm

25:32.095 --> 25:35.403
to bring the metal cannula
into place...

25:35.446 --> 25:38.972
4 millimeters shy
of our target,

25:39.015 --> 25:41.104
while I will adjust
the coordinates.

25:53.247 --> 25:56.206
Dr. Bartley will remove
the cells from the cooler

25:56.250 --> 25:57.643
and place them
under a microscope

25:57.686 --> 25:59.819
while we wait
to confirm viability.

25:59.862 --> 26:02.430
Which is torture.

26:14.703 --> 26:16.444
Nick:
IVC dissection complete.

26:16.487 --> 26:18.402
Portal vein and GDA
are divided.

26:18.446 --> 26:20.491
Good.

26:25.322 --> 26:27.237
Okay, here we go.

26:27.281 --> 26:29.109
We gently lift.

26:29.152 --> 26:30.632
Okay.

26:40.860 --> 26:42.426
Cell viability
confirmed.

26:53.176 --> 26:55.396
Thank you.

26:59.269 --> 27:02.055
We're gonna load the syringe
into the micro injector.

27:02.098 --> 27:03.230
How are we doing,
David?

27:03.273 --> 27:05.275
Can you hear my voice?

27:10.977 --> 27:11.891
They're paging
Dr. Shepherd

27:11.934 --> 27:13.457
to OR 2 immediately.

27:13.501 --> 27:15.111
Patient
with a CSF leak.

27:15.155 --> 27:17.026
Please. Someone with
training wheels can handle that.

27:17.070 --> 27:19.594
It's not like Shepherd's
sitting around doing Sudoku.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.378
The patient
is Dr. Hunt.

27:34.740 --> 27:36.655
Shepherd,
syringes are locked and loaded.

27:36.698 --> 27:37.743
Owen is my patient.

27:37.786 --> 27:39.048
He could be suffering
a complication

27:39.092 --> 27:40.397
from a procedure
that I've already done on him.

27:40.441 --> 27:42.051
Are you seriously considering
leaving this room?

27:44.184 --> 27:45.446
Tom knows the procedure
as well as I do.

27:45.489 --> 27:46.795
Amelia.
Fact.

27:48.405 --> 27:49.798
Meredith, it's Owen.

27:49.842 --> 27:51.931
Meredith:
No,. It cannot be you.

27:51.974 --> 27:53.323
<i> If you were to walk out of here</i>
<i>right now,</i>

27:53.367 --> 27:54.934
<i>we will lose</i>
<i>the FDA approval,</i>

27:54.977 --> 27:56.239
the funding will stop,

27:56.283 --> 27:57.676
and this whole thing
would've been for nothing.

27:59.547 --> 28:02.419
What? Y-You want me
to miss this epic surgery?

28:02.463 --> 28:04.813
The genius who provided you
with the 3-D hydrogel brains?

28:04.857 --> 28:07.642
The needle is locked on target
and motorized injector is ready.

28:09.426 --> 28:11.211
Would it help
if I said please?

28:11.254 --> 28:12.255
Fine.

28:12.299 --> 28:14.257
But you owe me
way more than one.

28:14.301 --> 28:16.346
I want to be paged
the second you finish.

28:16.390 --> 28:18.566
I want to be credited
the second you publish on this.

28:22.309 --> 28:23.440
Proceed, Dr. Bartley.

28:23.484 --> 28:26.052
Locking the differential
on the injector.

28:27.575 --> 28:30.012
We're set for
two microliters per minute.

28:32.275 --> 28:33.668
Injecting the cells.

28:37.541 --> 28:38.673
How's Owen doing?

28:38.717 --> 28:40.109
Don't know.

28:40.153 --> 28:42.895
Okay. Yeah, we don't have
to...talk about it.

28:44.461 --> 28:45.724
I think I'm done.

28:45.767 --> 28:46.768
Yeah,
probably for the best.

28:46.812 --> 28:48.596
You don't want
to...kill anybody.

28:50.554 --> 28:52.339
Done with my marriage.

28:56.256 --> 29:00.390
You and Owen went through
a terrifying experience --

29:00.434 --> 29:03.306
the -- the accident and then
Farouk's heart transplant.

29:03.350 --> 29:05.482
I think if --No, that's not it.

29:05.526 --> 29:07.310
It's...

29:07.354 --> 29:11.314
Owen's done something that
I can't even begin to --

29:11.358 --> 29:13.055
I mean, it's not like
he killed people.

29:13.099 --> 29:14.883
Mm.

29:14.927 --> 29:18.713
But let's just pretend
it's that bad.

29:18.757 --> 29:22.195
And I am tired,
and I am angry,

29:22.238 --> 29:26.025
and I don't know how long
I can keep this thing inside.

29:28.418 --> 29:30.116
I slept with Link.

29:30.159 --> 29:33.075
And I-I may love him,

29:33.119 --> 29:35.948
because when you have sex
with your best friend

29:35.991 --> 29:39.778
and the intimacy
and generosity

29:39.821 --> 29:43.085
and orgasms
are...earth shattering,

29:43.129 --> 29:45.305
it is very, very hard
to go back.

29:47.176 --> 29:48.874
But he --
he doesn't love me

29:48.917 --> 29:50.701
because he's too busy
loving someone

29:50.745 --> 29:52.703
who doesn't love him back.

29:52.747 --> 29:54.836
Maybe this is what happens
when I don't go to a bar

29:54.880 --> 29:56.751
for a really long time.

30:06.108 --> 30:07.066
Hello?

30:09.285 --> 30:12.549
Okay, Owen,
Teddy is on her way.

30:12.593 --> 30:13.942
You called her?

30:13.986 --> 30:15.161
Typically, I inform
a patient's family

30:15.204 --> 30:16.162
of an emergent surgery.

30:16.205 --> 30:18.077
- I'm a softie like that.
- Thanks.

30:18.120 --> 30:20.383
Okay. Hopefully, we're looking
at a simple dural patch

30:20.427 --> 30:22.168
to repair the CSF leak,
won't take long.

30:22.211 --> 30:24.126
And look,
I know I might not be

30:24.170 --> 30:25.867
your first choice
of neurosurgeons,

30:25.911 --> 30:27.347
maybe not even
your, uh, 10th.

30:27.390 --> 30:28.609
It's fine.

30:28.652 --> 30:30.089
Hunt, don't make me cry
before I open you up.

30:30.132 --> 30:31.699
I sob with my whole body.

30:31.742 --> 30:33.179
All of your cerebrospinal fluid
would be gone

30:33.222 --> 30:35.398
before I get myself --Tom.

30:35.442 --> 30:37.444
Alright, see you
on the other side.

30:41.535 --> 30:43.754
You're extremely
talented, Wright.

30:44.973 --> 30:47.062
Alright,
but it's creepy, huh?

30:47.106 --> 30:49.499
Look, look,
it's a drawing of masked beings

30:49.543 --> 30:52.241
letting a giant robot drill
metal tubes into a man's head,

30:52.285 --> 30:54.243
injecting him
with an unknown substance.

30:54.287 --> 30:56.550
Well, Meredith's
groundbreaking surgery

30:56.593 --> 30:59.770
looks like the next installment
of the "Alien" franchise.

30:59.814 --> 31:01.555
You like "Alien," too?

31:01.598 --> 31:03.470
Well,
get out if you don't.

31:03.513 --> 31:05.994
It's a sci-fi classic

31:06.038 --> 31:08.127
and one of the best
horror movies ever made.

31:08.170 --> 31:10.607
Thank you. They truly perfected
the jump scare.

31:10.651 --> 31:12.392
Yeah. The -- The -- Ah.
Okay.

31:13.610 --> 31:14.916
Five years ago,
this surgery would've

31:14.960 --> 31:16.309
seemed like
science fiction.

31:16.352 --> 31:18.485
Makes you think
about what's next.

31:18.528 --> 31:20.008
Space.
Right, Chief?

31:21.836 --> 31:22.924
Who's going to space?

31:22.968 --> 31:24.230
No one.

31:32.803 --> 31:34.936
Hit it.

31:35.981 --> 31:37.460
Patient's name?

31:37.504 --> 31:39.332
Arthur Kyat, 21.

31:39.375 --> 31:40.594
End-stage liver disease,

31:40.637 --> 31:42.770
secondary to Primary
Sclerosing Cholangitis.

31:42.813 --> 31:44.946
Patient's getting orthotopic
liver transplant today.

31:44.990 --> 31:46.034
Good.

31:46.078 --> 31:46.948
Donor's name?

31:48.558 --> 31:49.951
Donor's name?

31:51.605 --> 31:52.649
James.

31:52.693 --> 31:55.043
His name is James.

31:55.087 --> 31:57.176
You know, I've stood next
to a hundred different doctors

31:57.219 --> 31:59.569
waiting in line
to retrieve organs,

31:59.613 --> 32:01.180
and that's what it is
to a lot of them --

32:01.223 --> 32:03.573
an organ that will help
save <i>their</i> patient,

32:03.617 --> 32:06.141
but it's not just an organ,
is it?

32:06.185 --> 32:08.491
It was somebody's life,

32:08.535 --> 32:10.537
somebody's brother,
somebody's child.

32:10.580 --> 32:11.973
It's the greatest gift
a human being can give

32:12.017 --> 32:13.453
to another human being.

32:13.496 --> 32:15.629
And if you want to be
a great transplant surgeon,

32:15.672 --> 32:16.978
can't forget that.

32:17.022 --> 32:20.199
You cannot forget the person
who gave the gifts.

32:20.242 --> 32:21.678
Okay?

32:21.722 --> 32:23.637
We're ready.
Scalpel, please.

32:29.382 --> 32:31.993
Setting the robot
for trajectory number three.

32:45.267 --> 32:46.181
Okay.

32:48.488 --> 32:50.011
You okay?

32:50.055 --> 32:52.013
Yeah, I just --
I need a minute.

32:58.280 --> 32:59.673
Have you heard anything
about Owen yet?

32:59.716 --> 33:01.631
No.

33:01.675 --> 33:03.024
You could check on this
later.

33:03.068 --> 33:04.634
'Cause while someone you care
about is in another room

33:04.678 --> 33:06.288
getting surgery right now,

33:06.332 --> 33:08.682
someone <i>I</i> care about has
his brain open in this room.

33:21.390 --> 33:24.437
Ready for the third injection
for this side of the brain.

33:24.480 --> 33:25.351
Here we go.

33:39.365 --> 33:41.323
Woman over PA:
<i>Dr. Kassulke to the ER.</i>

33:41.367 --> 33:43.934
<i>Dr. Kurt Kassulke to the ER.</i>

33:52.682 --> 33:54.380
You're here.

33:57.861 --> 33:59.950
People do crazy things
when they're triggered,

33:59.994 --> 34:03.171
or in
a mental-health crisis,

34:03.215 --> 34:04.346
and...

34:06.566 --> 34:09.047
When my phone rang today
and it was Tom...

34:12.093 --> 34:14.661
...I remembered that I made
decisions when I was triggered.

34:17.272 --> 34:20.232
And those decisions
didn't take you

34:20.275 --> 34:22.799
or our family
into consideration.

34:24.758 --> 34:27.500
I remembered how much
you'd forgiven me for.

34:30.416 --> 34:31.852
But...

34:33.854 --> 34:36.117
I don't -- I don't know.

34:36.161 --> 34:39.816
I don't know if I can forgive
you for this, Owen.

34:39.860 --> 34:42.906
But I know
that we have to --

34:42.950 --> 34:46.040
we have to talk.
We have to try.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.999
I'm not triggered, and I'm not
in a mental-health crisis.

34:52.133 --> 34:54.222
I stand by what I did
and how I did it.

34:57.225 --> 34:59.749
But I love you, Teddy.

35:05.538 --> 35:07.931
I love you,
and I'm glad you want to talk.

35:15.374 --> 35:17.115
So, assuming
normal recovery,

35:17.158 --> 35:18.899
he should be walking around
in a few weeks.

35:18.942 --> 35:21.597
And then at a Wolves game
with me in a month or so.

35:23.425 --> 35:25.471
Hey.

35:28.822 --> 35:29.997
- Thank you.
- Hmm.

35:34.871 --> 35:36.351
I don't know
how to thank them.

35:39.224 --> 35:42.488
How do I thank the people
who lost their son today?

36:02.160 --> 36:06.468
All day long,
I've been racking my brain

36:06.512 --> 36:09.210
trying to figure out
who in their right mind

36:09.254 --> 36:11.734
would have left that surgery
the way you were prepared to.

36:14.824 --> 36:18.219
And then it dawned
on me --

36:18.263 --> 36:23.093
you are someone who loves
her people so hard and so much

36:23.137 --> 36:24.660
that the second
they're in trouble,

36:24.704 --> 36:28.360
everything else
just...falls away.

36:31.189 --> 36:35.845
Guilty...as charged.

36:35.889 --> 36:37.804
I've never met
anyone like that.

36:37.847 --> 36:40.241
It's...

36:40.285 --> 36:41.373
Infuriating?

36:41.416 --> 36:42.765
Well...

36:42.809 --> 36:45.725
I was gonna say inspiring.

36:45.768 --> 36:47.944
But yours works, too.

36:51.600 --> 36:52.732
I can't believe
we did it.

36:55.474 --> 36:56.779
Believe it.

37:06.963 --> 37:08.617
Oh, my God, Link!
Oh, crap!

37:08.661 --> 37:09.923
You scared
the hell out of me!

37:09.966 --> 37:12.273
What are you doing
in here?

37:12.317 --> 37:15.407
Sorry, your water pressure's
so much better,

37:15.450 --> 37:20.020
and I thought you were out,
so I decided to take a shower.

37:20.063 --> 37:23.328
Yeah, I can...

37:23.371 --> 37:24.764
I can see that.

37:40.693 --> 37:41.868
Sorry.

37:44.436 --> 37:45.611
Me, too.

37:51.181 --> 37:52.226
How are we gonna do this?

37:54.272 --> 37:56.056
I don't know.

37:57.187 --> 37:58.319
You want me to move out?

37:58.363 --> 38:00.408
No!

38:11.593 --> 38:14.117
Some people don't like
open-world role-playing games

38:14.161 --> 38:16.337
because there's
too many choices,

38:16.381 --> 38:18.948
but the beauty
of the game design

38:18.992 --> 38:23.475
is that...you get to create
your own character.

38:23.518 --> 38:26.608
You get to be
whoever you want to be.

38:26.652 --> 38:30.569
You level up, um, abilities
to be anyone you want to be,

38:30.612 --> 38:33.702
and if you fail,
you get to try again

38:33.746 --> 38:34.921
in a completely
different way.

38:34.964 --> 38:38.577
Y-You can go
somewhere else

38:38.620 --> 38:40.361
or take a different path.

38:40.405 --> 38:42.494
Possibilities are endless.

38:42.537 --> 38:45.366
That beauty's
in medicine, too.

38:45.410 --> 38:47.368
No, well,
th-- think about it.

38:47.412 --> 38:49.370
When you have
foundational knowledge

38:49.414 --> 38:51.938
and skill set,

38:51.981 --> 38:54.201
the possibilities
<i>are</i> endless.

38:54.244 --> 38:57.335
You can choose your specialty
or a form of research,

38:57.378 --> 38:58.510
whether you want to teach --

38:58.553 --> 39:02.601
multiple paths exist
to save lives.

39:02.644 --> 39:05.908
Schmitt, you belong
on one of them.

39:06.779 --> 39:08.650
Come back.

39:08.694 --> 39:11.566
You and I can find
our way together --

39:11.610 --> 39:13.002
a new way.

39:16.441 --> 39:19.444
I appreciate you coming here,
Dr. Webber,

39:19.487 --> 39:22.447
trying to salvage my career,
rescue me.

39:23.491 --> 39:24.753
But you're too late.

39:26.494 --> 39:27.756
I've already bled out.

39:29.062 --> 39:30.542
There's nothing left
to save.

39:34.328 --> 39:36.548
I'm gonna, um, lay down.

39:36.591 --> 39:38.245
You can play if you want.

39:39.638 --> 39:42.075
Meredith:
<i>When people hear our names,</i>

39:42.118 --> 39:43.424
<i>what will they remember?</i>

39:48.342 --> 39:50.039
<i>What did we leave behind?</i>

39:57.351 --> 39:59.397
So?

39:59.440 --> 40:00.615
When does it start?

40:00.659 --> 40:02.400
Uh, when does what start?

40:02.443 --> 40:04.489
The flight surgeon
training.

40:04.532 --> 40:05.620
You got to get
board certified

40:05.664 --> 40:07.013
in aerospace medicine first,
right?

40:08.362 --> 40:10.538
Please tell me you said yes
to your friend.

40:10.582 --> 40:13.149
Of course I did not.

40:13.193 --> 40:15.413
Oh, Chief Bailey,
he called <i>you!</i>

40:15.456 --> 40:16.675
You can't say no.

40:16.718 --> 40:18.024
What if...

40:18.067 --> 40:20.853
W-What if --
hear me out.

40:20.896 --> 40:22.681
What if
you're the Chosen One,

40:22.724 --> 40:24.683
the only one
in the galaxy

40:24.726 --> 40:27.033
who can take the job
and restore it to order?

40:27.076 --> 40:29.035
I prefer to think of myself
as Rey.

40:29.078 --> 40:32.168
And Rey <i>is</i> the Chosen One,

40:32.212 --> 40:33.822
after Luke's fall.

40:33.866 --> 40:34.954
Disagree.

40:34.997 --> 40:36.390
Okay, that was --

40:36.434 --> 40:37.522
hey, that was
a faulty prophecy.
Mm.

40:40.046 --> 40:42.875
But, Chief,
you said it yourself.

40:42.918 --> 40:45.094
It's a dream of yours
to work for NASA.

40:45.138 --> 40:50.012
I'm not in a place to be making
decisions based on dreams.

40:52.537 --> 40:55.148
You have no idea.

40:55.191 --> 40:58.934
Only bright spot around here
lately has been you.

41:03.373 --> 41:05.637
I'm...sor--

41:05.680 --> 41:07.290
Oh, whoa.

41:07.334 --> 41:08.901
I must've misread
the situation.

41:08.944 --> 41:12.513
Uh...good night, Doc--
Chief Bailey.

41:12.557 --> 41:13.819
Goodnight, Chief Bailey.

41:13.862 --> 41:16.169
<i>Did we blaze trails?</i>

41:16.212 --> 41:18.127
<i>Did we guide</i>
<i>a new generation?</i>

41:18.171 --> 41:20.260
<i>Did we bestow</i>
<i>all the wisdom we could?</i>

41:21.740 --> 41:23.742
<i>Have we paved a legacy?</i>

41:29.487 --> 41:30.618
Oh, my Lord.

41:30.662 --> 41:32.925
Hi!
Surprise.

41:32.968 --> 41:34.666
Feel like
I'm still dreaming here.

41:35.971 --> 41:37.451
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

41:37.495 --> 41:39.192
Good.
Good.

41:39.235 --> 41:40.889
I just thought
I would come and give you

41:40.933 --> 41:42.195
the surgery update
in person.

41:42.238 --> 41:43.501
You pulled it off,
didn't you?

41:43.544 --> 41:45.894
We did.

41:45.938 --> 41:47.113
I never had a doubt
in my mind.

41:47.156 --> 41:48.636
There was just
one small hiccup, though.

41:48.680 --> 41:50.072
Oh, yeah? What's that?

41:50.116 --> 41:52.379
That the only person
I wanted to celebrate with

41:52.422 --> 41:53.989
lives 1,500 miles away.

41:54.033 --> 41:56.209
Oh, what a jerk.
Seriously.

41:56.252 --> 41:57.384
<i>Maybe instead of wanting</i>
<i>to be known</i>

41:57.427 --> 41:58.472
<i>for what we've done...</i>

41:58.516 --> 41:59.821
But wait.

41:59.865 --> 42:00.822
Y-You were dreaming
about me?

42:00.866 --> 42:01.736
No! I --

42:01.780 --> 42:03.042
You said you were.

42:03.085 --> 42:04.565
No, I knew I shouldn't have
told you that.

42:04.609 --> 42:06.698
- Come in.
- Okay.

42:08.047 --> 42:10.310
<i>...let's be known</i>
<i>for who we are.</i>
