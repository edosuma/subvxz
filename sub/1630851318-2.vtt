WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:02.407
Ethicure.

00:02.600 --> 00:05.631
Devoted to an improved, accessible,

00:05.681 --> 00:09.440
for-profit, state-of-the-art
healthcare experience.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.951
An experience we curate

00:12.024 --> 00:14.812
via our Three Pillars
of the Ethicure mission.

00:15.747 --> 00:19.584
Pillar one, our hospital.

00:19.618 --> 00:23.421
A new color palette designed
to create a sense of well-being.

00:23.455 --> 00:25.403
Cutting edge technologies.

00:25.427 --> 00:28.396
Faster testing and imaging results.

00:28.430 --> 00:30.198
And countless new surgical innovations.

00:30.999 --> 00:33.600
Pillar two, our doctors.

00:34.810 --> 00:37.205
We want you healthy and happy,

00:37.239 --> 00:41.024
so if you look under the table,
you will find,

00:42.067 --> 00:44.069
custom fitness trackers,

00:45.237 --> 00:47.381
Ethicure scrubs,

00:47.416 --> 00:49.917
along with a few other goodies.

00:49.952 --> 00:52.887
We'll also be introducing
new well-being incentives

00:52.921 --> 00:56.104
and protocols designed
to encourage teamwork

00:56.410 --> 00:58.311
and mutual respect.

00:59.186 --> 01:00.887
Bosses have first names, too.

01:02.438 --> 01:04.732
Which leads us to pillar three.

01:05.140 --> 01:07.468
At Ethicure, we do not treat patients.

01:07.536 --> 01:09.303
We serve clients.

01:09.371 --> 01:11.272
So we will be seeking their feedback

01:11.306 --> 01:13.975
at every stage
of the Ethicure experience,

01:14.391 --> 01:17.686
because a happy client
is a referring client.

01:19.605 --> 01:21.449
My name is Salen.

01:21.815 --> 01:24.651
Welcome to the Ethicure family.

01:26.655 --> 01:28.956
I really want to break this.

01:28.991 --> 01:30.825
Our jobs no longer depend
on saving lives,

01:30.893 --> 01:32.627
but how many smiley faces get punched.

01:32.661 --> 01:34.462
- It's cute.
- Thank you!

01:34.995 --> 01:37.632
She's just incentivizing niceness.

01:37.666 --> 01:40.568
You of all people do not want
to be rated by how nice you are.

01:40.602 --> 01:43.738
I can't fake saving lives,
but being nice?

01:43.772 --> 01:45.606
Way easier to game.

01:45.641 --> 01:47.675
It counts your steps, your pulse ox,

01:47.743 --> 01:51.612
monitors when you sleep,
warns you when you're stressed,

01:51.647 --> 01:54.849
and stores a thousand playlists.

01:54.917 --> 01:57.485
- If it vibrated, I'd marry it.
- Jordan.

01:57.519 --> 02:00.154
Ethicure knows where we are,
what we're listening to,

02:00.189 --> 02:02.590
how we're sleeping,
maybe even who we're sleeping with.

02:02.624 --> 02:05.092
It also tracks paranoia.

02:05.127 --> 02:06.594
You're fine with all of this?

02:06.628 --> 02:07.862
I mean, it's great if you are,

02:07.930 --> 02:10.844
but change is sometimes tricky for you.

02:10.893 --> 02:12.466
I was concerned,

02:12.501 --> 02:15.169
but Ethicure's changes seem
reasonable and data-driven.

02:15.204 --> 02:17.240
I think we should start
by picking a cake.

02:17.280 --> 02:18.981
You prioritized the cake,

02:19.049 --> 02:21.169
over the date, the venue, the caterer...

02:21.203 --> 02:22.751
I like cake.

02:22.786 --> 02:24.787
I've compiled a list
of the most popular ones.

02:24.821 --> 02:26.422
What is your favorite cake?

02:26.456 --> 02:28.124
Whatever you think our guests will like.

02:28.158 --> 02:30.159
There is no such thing as bad cake.

02:30.721 --> 02:32.495
Whew. Take a good look.

02:32.562 --> 02:34.163
You won't be seeing
much of me for a while.

02:34.231 --> 02:38.134
I'll be very busy turning
a good program into a bad one.

02:38.662 --> 02:39.795
Yeah.

02:42.773 --> 02:44.040
Shaun.

02:45.774 --> 02:47.276
Shaun.

02:49.987 --> 02:51.080
Oh.

02:51.488 --> 02:52.681
Love you.

02:55.685 --> 02:56.819
She's hemorrhaging.

02:56.853 --> 02:58.621
Ultrasound to assess etiology.

02:58.655 --> 03:00.489
Hanging blood and fluids,
starting pressers.

03:02.659 --> 03:05.161
The baby's placenta
is covering the cervix.

03:05.195 --> 03:07.296
The baby's brachycardic.
Mom needs C-section, STAT.

03:12.002 --> 03:13.435
You'll need to stay here.

03:13.470 --> 03:15.004
Can't let her out of my sight, Doctor.

03:15.038 --> 03:17.014
She's doing life
for murdering her first baby.

03:22.062 --> 03:30.062

03:32.189 --> 03:34.156
I'm up there for two gallbladders.

03:34.191 --> 03:37.115
Do you know I completed my residency?

03:37.139 --> 03:38.219
Blame SurgiMatch.

03:38.253 --> 03:39.728
I mean, I wouldn't have
put you on the schedule at all

03:39.796 --> 03:42.464
until you at least knew
where the bathrooms were.

03:42.499 --> 03:44.667
Oh, come on, guapa,
look at all this stuff.

03:44.701 --> 03:48.037
I'm a kid in a candy store
and I'm starving to death.

03:48.503 --> 03:51.119
Please don't call me guapa at work.

03:51.151 --> 03:52.641
Yes, Audrey.

03:52.676 --> 03:55.052
Bosses have first names, too.

03:55.545 --> 03:57.546
- What do you think of her?
- I'm not a fan

03:57.581 --> 03:59.381
of an algorithm telling me what to do.

03:59.416 --> 04:00.549
This thing did a great job

04:00.584 --> 04:02.818
filling up my dance card
for the next week.

04:02.852 --> 04:04.478
She knows what I like.

04:04.921 --> 04:07.523
Good to have you on board.
Glad to be here.

04:07.557 --> 04:09.425
Not all of our dance cards are full.

04:09.492 --> 04:11.493
Mind if I tag along
on your morning rounds,

04:11.528 --> 04:12.895
maybe show me where the bathrooms are?

04:12.929 --> 04:14.563
Sure.

04:14.598 --> 04:15.931
Let's cha-cha.

04:20.904 --> 04:22.271
I looked up her case.

04:22.339 --> 04:23.772
Abby Clemmis was charged

04:23.840 --> 04:26.075
with poisoning her baby with antifreeze.

04:26.109 --> 04:30.179
She pleaded not guilty and got
pregnant again before the trial.

04:30.213 --> 04:31.847
But when she was convicted,

04:31.881 --> 04:33.882
her boyfriend, like everybody else,
stopped believing her.

04:33.917 --> 04:35.801
Oh, boo-hoo.

04:36.519 --> 04:38.621
Stay focused. You're now being timed.

04:38.688 --> 04:40.389
All part of the productivity metric.

04:46.029 --> 04:48.430
Forget the timer.
It takes as long as it takes.

04:50.433 --> 04:53.102
I like knowing how long it takes.

04:57.440 --> 04:59.475
It was probably postpartum depression.

04:59.542 --> 05:01.076
Doesn't make the baby any less dead.

05:01.111 --> 05:03.245
But we might have a little sympathy.

05:03.280 --> 05:05.881
Because women are helpless
victims of our hormones?

05:05.915 --> 05:07.816
Like people who should be
treated rather than punished.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.442
What's your favorite cake?

05:11.988 --> 05:15.057
Lea and I need to pick a cake
for our wedding.

05:15.091 --> 05:16.258
Angel food cake.

05:16.293 --> 05:18.327
Packing peanuts have more flavor.

05:18.395 --> 05:21.096
Anything with cream cheese frosting.

05:21.131 --> 05:22.764
I'd eat dog poop with that on it.

05:24.734 --> 05:26.810
Oh, please, uh, don't let me
distract you.

05:30.173 --> 05:33.150
So, Salen, it's great to see you again.

05:34.010 --> 05:35.811
I loved how you kicked
the tires on this place.

05:35.845 --> 05:37.980
Nice due diligence.

05:48.157 --> 05:50.425
What a beautiful sound.

05:51.428 --> 05:53.170
Discharge them.

05:53.697 --> 05:56.632
Uh, we have a 48-hour
post-op monitoring policy.

05:56.666 --> 05:58.338
And now we have a new policy.

05:58.382 --> 06:00.636
As soon as they're stable,
you'll discharge them,

06:00.670 --> 06:02.721
to make way for other clients in need.

06:10.413 --> 06:12.881
This is Madeline, came in
experiencing dizziness

06:12.906 --> 06:15.041
and severe nausea after
running in a college track meet.

06:15.151 --> 06:16.952
And winning the 100 meter.

06:16.986 --> 06:19.188
Urine analysis and
abdominal X-ray were normal.

06:19.222 --> 06:21.623
I could try a G.I. cocktail
to rule out gastritis.

06:21.658 --> 06:23.192
Sit back here.

06:25.962 --> 06:27.863
Any pain here?

06:27.897 --> 06:29.965
I just set a state record.

06:29.999 --> 06:31.567
It's heat exhaustion and dehydration.

06:31.634 --> 06:33.335
You sprint in full face?

06:33.370 --> 06:35.471
I doubt my makeup could run
faster than I do.

06:35.505 --> 06:37.239
I ran track in college.

06:37.307 --> 06:39.308
- Mmm?
- I found the makeup

06:39.342 --> 06:40.709
really helped.

06:40.744 --> 06:42.153
You feel well enough
to step up on the scanner?

06:42.178 --> 06:43.278
Yeah.

06:47.217 --> 06:48.851
Inset your hand here.

06:48.885 --> 06:51.820
Scanning.

06:53.189 --> 06:55.090
It even knows
what you had for breakfast.

06:55.158 --> 06:56.658
Perfusion's good,

06:56.693 --> 06:58.385
pulses are strong.

06:58.429 --> 07:00.662
Not surprisingly, you're in
top physical condition.

07:00.697 --> 07:01.830
I told you, it's just...

07:05.335 --> 07:06.735
She's hypoxic!

07:06.770 --> 07:09.271
We need to suction
and protect her airway.

07:22.051 --> 07:23.585
Meggie, my baby...

07:23.620 --> 07:24.887
She's fine.

07:24.921 --> 07:26.622
Seven pounds, three ounces,

07:26.689 --> 07:29.307
and, uh, the lungs of an opera singer.

07:29.926 --> 07:31.351
Can I see her?

07:32.686 --> 07:34.763
Just a peek through a window,
anything...

07:34.798 --> 07:36.432
That's not possible.

07:36.466 --> 07:38.233
We're gonna start
processing your discharge.

07:40.069 --> 07:42.946
After we run a few more tests,
just to be safe.

07:44.698 --> 07:47.609
I know you're feeling
overwhelmed right now,

07:47.644 --> 07:52.247
and I'm sure you'll be
experiencing anxiety, sadness.

07:52.282 --> 07:54.817
If you do suffer
from postpartum depression,

07:54.884 --> 07:56.718
you'll need to get help.

07:57.754 --> 07:59.822
I sure didn't have that with Troy.

08:01.624 --> 08:03.892
Those were the most wonderful
days of my life.

08:07.497 --> 08:12.434
So, that means I'm either
a victim or a monster.

08:15.158 --> 08:16.229
Pick a side.

08:23.079 --> 08:25.681
We stopped the bleeding,
but your CT confirmed

08:25.748 --> 08:28.325
a lesion in your lung.

08:28.725 --> 08:31.630
Which may be benign, but we
have to do a biopsy to know for sure.

08:32.323 --> 08:34.423
If I had a lesion in my lung,

08:34.457 --> 08:35.764
wouldn't that be slowing me down?

08:35.798 --> 08:39.361
The rest of your lung is healthy
and compensating very well.

08:39.429 --> 08:41.530
Any history of lung disease
in your family?

08:41.597 --> 08:43.532
- I don't know.
- A medical history can help

08:43.600 --> 08:45.801
dictate diagnostic
and treatment options.

08:45.835 --> 08:47.269
Can we contact your family?

08:47.303 --> 08:50.873
No, um... my parents are...

08:50.940 --> 08:52.107
- They're...
- Your mother's here.

08:54.511 --> 08:56.102
Are you okay, Madeline?

08:57.814 --> 08:59.481
That's not my mother.

09:00.049 --> 09:01.566
My parents died two years ago.

09:11.115 --> 09:13.483
I was a toddler when she
gave me up for adoption,

09:13.518 --> 09:14.818
and then went back to Cameroon...

09:14.852 --> 09:17.721
I didn't give you up. I was deported.

09:17.770 --> 09:20.624
I let you stay in America so
you could have a better life.

09:22.994 --> 09:26.508
Welcome back. I worked
in Cameroon for a while.

09:26.751 --> 09:29.819
Is it okay if Esther gives us
some medical history?

09:30.073 --> 09:31.941
Does anyone in your family
have high blood pressure?

09:32.263 --> 09:35.005
I do. Is that the problem?

09:35.039 --> 09:37.307
I told her she had to
watch what she eats.

09:37.341 --> 09:38.642
She won't listen to me.

09:38.676 --> 09:40.076
And why should I?

09:40.144 --> 09:41.645
I barely know you.

09:41.679 --> 09:43.146
Showing up at my track meets

09:43.181 --> 09:45.015
doesn't make you a mother, Esther.

09:45.049 --> 09:47.184
- What about high cholesterol?
- No.

09:47.404 --> 09:49.152
In Cameroon, you don't call elders

09:49.187 --> 09:51.021
- by their first name.
- Okay.

09:51.055 --> 09:53.690
And you don't show everyone
all your goodies.

09:53.724 --> 09:55.826
Your "parents" didn't teach you respect.

09:59.030 --> 10:00.959
Abby needs "a few more tests"?

10:01.545 --> 10:03.878
You just don't want
to send her back to prison.

10:04.449 --> 10:06.049
If she'd been getting decent healthcare,

10:06.074 --> 10:08.942
they would've caught
the placenta previa long ago.

10:09.106 --> 10:12.943
So if I can delay sending
Abby back there, I will.

10:13.010 --> 10:15.223
We're discharging her
as soon as possible.

10:18.850 --> 10:20.016
Look at this.

10:21.786 --> 10:23.253
Hypotonia?

10:25.130 --> 10:26.964
She's taking very little nutrition.

10:26.989 --> 10:29.958
Maybe ultrasound her
for a G.I. tract obstruction?

10:29.983 --> 10:32.490
We could change the formula.
She might just be a picky eater.

10:33.564 --> 10:35.365
Good point. I'll try that.

10:35.399 --> 10:37.267
Right after the ultrasound.

10:41.873 --> 10:43.168
Aaron.

10:43.927 --> 10:45.294
Ooh, fishing flies.

10:45.319 --> 10:46.629
Please don't touch.

10:47.150 --> 10:48.651
It's harder than brain surgery.

10:48.700 --> 10:50.600
Ow!

10:55.586 --> 10:57.787
Your absence at the
presentation this morning

10:57.822 --> 10:59.656
could be interpreted
as a lack of support.

10:59.724 --> 11:01.061
You think?

11:01.678 --> 11:05.515
When we first met,
you were a fake patient,

11:05.540 --> 11:07.107
and now you're
a hostile corporate raider.

11:07.231 --> 11:09.031
This hostile corporate raider

11:09.056 --> 11:11.123
saved your hospital
from being turned into condos.

11:11.154 --> 11:12.588
I resign.

11:13.771 --> 11:15.305
And I hate your new logo.

11:20.263 --> 11:22.064
You've got a very loyal following,

11:22.089 --> 11:24.591
many of whom will be very
opposed to this takeover.

11:24.749 --> 11:26.586
You leaving could have
a snowball effect.

11:27.685 --> 11:30.757
My board of directors... and I

11:31.395 --> 11:32.995
think it's important for you to stay on.

11:33.020 --> 11:34.921
So you can draw on my expertise?

11:35.092 --> 11:36.429
Or because you want a puppet?

11:38.148 --> 11:40.016
Either way, you've got decent leverage.

11:42.059 --> 11:44.194
Normally, I'd be offering stock options,

11:44.219 --> 11:48.022
salary incentives,
definitely a larger office,

11:48.052 --> 11:51.194
but I suspect none of those will work.

11:52.810 --> 11:56.112
So maybe, despite it being a money hole,

11:56.147 --> 11:58.815
I'll just keep your clinic open.

11:58.948 --> 12:00.082
How's that?

12:03.988 --> 12:05.416
Think about it.

12:35.325 --> 12:37.740
Your baby's not
getting enough nutrition.

12:38.322 --> 12:40.118
Her ultrasound was clear.

12:41.318 --> 12:43.163
I think Meggie needs her mother's milk.

13:03.748 --> 13:05.101
Hey.

13:06.396 --> 13:08.646
Hey, sweetie.

13:20.604 --> 13:21.871
The biopsy confirmed

13:21.896 --> 13:25.098
the mass in your lung
is malignant melanoma,

13:25.269 --> 13:26.831
stage four.

13:28.165 --> 13:31.434
Your PET scan show
it's also in the lymph nodes

13:31.459 --> 13:34.728
of your neck, abdomen, and pelvis.

13:38.716 --> 13:40.553
We'll remove what we can

13:40.711 --> 13:43.973
and follow up with molecular
and immunotherapies,

13:45.289 --> 13:46.790
but...

13:49.232 --> 13:50.832
The prognosis isn't good.

13:53.230 --> 13:55.665
Even with all targeted treatments,

13:55.690 --> 13:57.858
you're unlikely to live
more than 12 months.

13:58.135 --> 13:59.364
No.

14:00.438 --> 14:02.772
I'm healthy. I'm strong.

14:02.807 --> 14:04.077
I'm so sorry.

14:04.102 --> 14:07.121
Pray, Madeline. We have to pray.

14:07.844 --> 14:09.378
God will work through these doctors.

14:09.403 --> 14:10.971
No!

14:11.221 --> 14:13.002
I can't be dying.

14:14.057 --> 14:15.421
I'm going to nationals.

14:21.332 --> 14:23.888
This can't be right. It's a mistake.

14:30.987 --> 14:32.772
Stop praying!

14:34.424 --> 14:36.959
Stop pretending like you care about me.
You left me.

14:36.984 --> 14:38.818
I do care. I love you...

14:38.843 --> 14:42.112
No! My real mother
loved me and accepted me.

14:42.137 --> 14:44.449
I am your mother,
and right now, you need...

14:44.477 --> 14:46.965
No, I don't need anything from you.

14:46.990 --> 14:48.324
You're nothing.

14:48.349 --> 14:50.999
Please go away.

15:10.684 --> 15:12.818
She's vomiting. Cyanotic
and O2 stats are plummeting.

15:12.853 --> 15:14.019
She's tachycardic.

15:14.054 --> 15:15.588
Intubate.

15:20.694 --> 15:23.863
CBC, BMP, stool sample, and echo.

15:23.897 --> 15:25.498
And a tox screen for the mother.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.959
What's with the tox screen?
The mother's fine.

15:32.172 --> 15:34.206
I didn't change the baby's formula.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.075
I let Abby breastfeed her.

15:36.461 --> 15:37.777
I'm wondering if there's
something in that breast milk

15:37.844 --> 15:39.078
that made the baby sick.

15:39.112 --> 15:40.746
More likely it was antifreeze.

15:40.781 --> 15:42.704
Right. She smuggled antifreeze
into the hospital,

15:42.729 --> 15:44.248
from prison, under armed guard?

15:44.273 --> 15:45.584
It'd be insane.

15:45.619 --> 15:47.972
Like people who poison their babies.

15:53.460 --> 15:56.095
We'll be using
a basic Ranked-Choice Vote.

15:56.129 --> 15:58.130
It's not as nuanced
as the Kemeny-Young Method,

15:58.198 --> 15:59.598
which minimizes the sum

15:59.633 --> 16:02.101
of the Kendall Tau distances
to the voters' lists,

16:02.135 --> 16:05.771
but I decided that would be
too confusing for you.

16:06.199 --> 16:07.516
Intralesional injection?

16:07.541 --> 16:09.275
Madeline's melanoma is too widespread.

16:09.309 --> 16:11.043
Only used for locoregional disease.

16:11.077 --> 16:13.045
- This carrot cake is amazing.
- Mmm.

16:13.079 --> 16:15.714
How about peptide vaccine?

16:15.749 --> 16:17.950
Very high risk for immune
attacks against normal tissue.

16:17.984 --> 16:20.953
Ugh. Does anybody really like
red velvet cake?

16:21.029 --> 16:22.697
It reminds me of a dumb model,

16:22.722 --> 16:24.528
it's delicious-looking
but not worth the calories.

16:24.565 --> 16:25.635
Mmm.

16:26.636 --> 16:28.928
Complete lymph node dissection.

16:28.962 --> 16:30.932
The lymphedema would be intolerable.

16:32.225 --> 16:33.899
People die here, too, you know?

16:33.934 --> 16:36.602
It's my first day.
I haven't learned that yet.

16:36.636 --> 16:39.107
Wait, there's no way this thing
knows I'm eating dessert, right?

16:40.073 --> 16:42.640
I have been thinking about cake all day.

16:47.981 --> 16:49.315
Oh, don't let me interrupt you.

16:49.349 --> 16:51.317
You already have.

16:51.351 --> 16:52.985
And since you won't be invited
to my wedding,

16:53.019 --> 16:55.498
you don't get a vote. Or cake.

16:58.334 --> 17:00.759
You have an interesting affect.

17:00.946 --> 17:02.580
Are you on the autism spectrum?

17:06.532 --> 17:08.467
Please fill out your ballot.

17:08.502 --> 17:10.502
I'm neuroatypical myself.

17:10.537 --> 17:12.338
- ADHD.
- Mmm.

17:12.824 --> 17:14.157
Okay.

17:18.503 --> 17:20.815
You should look at
Engineered T Cell therapy.

17:33.493 --> 17:35.628
- They're all good.
- That's very unhelpful.

17:35.662 --> 17:37.363
I've polled 12 people.

17:37.397 --> 17:38.898
The cakes that got the most "loves"

17:38.965 --> 17:41.333
also got the most "hates,"
and the only cake that no one hated

17:41.368 --> 17:42.879
is one that no one loved.

17:44.865 --> 17:45.932
Why aren't you working?

17:45.957 --> 17:47.391
'Cause I'm tasting cake.

17:49.743 --> 17:51.877
Shaun, I...

17:51.912 --> 17:54.146
I have to tell you, I'm...

17:54.180 --> 17:55.748
I'm thinking of taking a break,

17:56.058 --> 17:57.716
of moving on.

17:57.751 --> 17:59.146
On to fishing?

17:59.199 --> 18:01.086
Maybe. Maybe not.

18:01.154 --> 18:04.023
Uh, probably not.
I don't really like fishing.

18:04.057 --> 18:05.491
I have no idea what I'm gonna do.

18:05.525 --> 18:07.278
Are you sad about Debbie?

18:08.161 --> 18:09.405
Yeah.

18:09.863 --> 18:12.598
Yeah, I am. But you know what?

18:12.666 --> 18:15.282
She wasn't happy,
so it's probably for the best,

18:15.317 --> 18:18.606
and right now, I just think I
want to take some time for myself.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.866
You want to be alone?

18:21.751 --> 18:23.008
I like people.

18:23.043 --> 18:25.177
I just think I need to be
around different people.

18:25.211 --> 18:27.379
- Different from me?
- No. No.

18:27.414 --> 18:30.115
I just think I need
a big change, you know?

18:30.183 --> 18:31.951
Well, there are plenty of changes here.

18:32.018 --> 18:33.352
Yeah, none that I like,

18:33.386 --> 18:34.753
except maybe the iced coffee,

18:34.788 --> 18:36.849
surprisingly good for a cafeteria.

18:40.986 --> 18:42.313
How are you coping?

18:44.798 --> 18:46.799
I need you to help me
pick the right cake.

18:46.866 --> 18:48.634
Shaun, it's your wedding.

18:48.702 --> 18:51.604
Be selfish. Pick the cake that you like.

18:55.408 --> 18:57.376
I've got no wife. I've got no kid.

18:57.410 --> 18:59.747
I'm soon to have no job.

19:00.580 --> 19:01.880
And I could get really depressed,

19:01.915 --> 19:03.415
but I'm not gonna do that.

19:03.450 --> 19:06.170
I'm gonna embrace it.
I'm gonna embrace freedom.

19:06.399 --> 19:10.091
And for once in my life,
I'm not gonna care about anything else.

19:12.183 --> 19:14.218
I'm glad you have
such a positive outlook.

19:14.243 --> 19:15.844
You didn't help with the cake.

19:25.030 --> 19:27.165
We've scheduled your surgery,
after which, we'll start you

19:27.190 --> 19:30.259
on an aggressive course of
molecular and immunotherapy.

19:31.112 --> 19:34.365
So you'll make me sicker first,
and then I'll die.

19:34.494 --> 19:37.092
This could offer you several
more months of healthy I...

19:37.577 --> 19:39.745
Engineered T Cell therapy.

19:41.354 --> 19:43.188
It's an experimental treatment

19:43.256 --> 19:46.836
that teaches your immune
system to fight the cancer.

19:47.780 --> 19:49.700
Your body could cure itself.

19:54.340 --> 19:56.407
You're off my case.

19:56.936 --> 19:58.804
The technology's here.

19:58.838 --> 20:01.306
The trial is available. Why not use it?

20:01.341 --> 20:03.809
You were there to observe and learn,
not diagnose and treat.

20:03.843 --> 20:05.344
You're not her doctor.

20:05.378 --> 20:07.312
She doesn't have specific mutations

20:07.347 --> 20:09.131
for most molecular therapies to work...

20:09.156 --> 20:10.482
He offered her a treatment

20:10.517 --> 20:12.718
that wasn't approved
by me, you, or the FDA.

20:12.786 --> 20:15.154
That's a violation of protocol,
not to mention, it...

20:15.188 --> 20:17.356
The Wi-Fi's good in here, right?

20:18.117 --> 20:20.159
Just need to answer some e-mails.

20:25.231 --> 20:27.209
Oh, please, continue your discussion.

20:31.504 --> 20:34.573
Sorry for the overstep, Marcus,

20:34.598 --> 20:38.846
but I do feel T Cell therapy
is a more effective option.

20:39.345 --> 20:43.515
Well, Mateo, the trials were isolated,

20:43.550 --> 20:46.646
small sample, and not very encouraging.

20:47.721 --> 20:51.150
Infection could kill her
way before the cancer would.

20:53.566 --> 20:57.073
And what about the patient?
What does she want?

20:58.723 --> 21:01.759
It was presented to her as a
somewhat magical solution.

21:02.001 --> 21:03.454
- Sh...
- I like magic.

21:05.505 --> 21:07.372
Did you want to weigh in?

21:07.407 --> 21:09.877
Oh, no. I'm... I'm not a doctor.

21:10.243 --> 21:12.377
I do have two doctorates, though,

21:12.412 --> 21:14.340
neurotech and data science.

21:16.688 --> 21:18.052
Not helpful. Right.

21:27.372 --> 21:29.640
Give the client what she wants.

21:32.732 --> 21:34.360
This is my case.

21:35.569 --> 21:36.847
It doesn't have to be.

21:46.936 --> 21:49.041
Abby's tox screen is clean.

21:49.285 --> 21:51.544
Whatever the baby got, she
didn't get it from the mother.

21:51.774 --> 21:54.042
At least not accidentally.

21:54.110 --> 21:56.211
Sometimes, telling the guilty
from the innocent

21:56.279 --> 21:57.679
is harder than you think.

21:59.615 --> 22:01.149
It just got easier.

22:02.926 --> 22:05.558
There are traces of antifreeze
in the baby's blood.

22:17.246 --> 22:18.680
Doctor.

22:20.002 --> 22:21.615
How's Madeline?

22:21.771 --> 22:24.006
The Chief of Surgery took over her case.

22:24.031 --> 22:26.132
She's in the very best of hands.

22:28.464 --> 22:30.064
Can I see her?

22:32.014 --> 22:33.794
I don't think she's ready.

22:36.881 --> 22:39.800
I made a huge sacrifice
when I left her in America.

22:40.968 --> 22:43.024
I never thought she'd be so ungrateful.

22:44.454 --> 22:46.855
Those people turned her
against her culture,

22:47.155 --> 22:48.684
against me.

22:50.920 --> 22:52.313
But that's my fault.

22:54.363 --> 22:55.697
I let her go.

22:58.741 --> 23:01.363
You gave Madeline up out of love.

23:02.058 --> 23:05.326
Don't let regret blind you from
seeing how wonderful she is.

23:07.286 --> 23:10.164
And as for the people
who made her that way?

23:11.220 --> 23:15.085
Be grateful for all
the sacrifices they made.

23:25.535 --> 23:28.036
I used to be a lot like you.

23:28.474 --> 23:30.806
If I was like you,

23:30.873 --> 23:32.541
Esther would love it.

23:32.575 --> 23:34.443
Don't let the white coat fool you.

23:34.477 --> 23:36.278
I have some ink, too.

23:36.312 --> 23:37.446
I just keep it covered at work.

23:38.648 --> 23:40.482
My mother doesn't like it, either.

23:42.585 --> 23:44.619
My mom was a total hippie.

23:46.722 --> 23:48.123
She didn't care
if I painted my face blue.

23:48.157 --> 23:50.459
She just wanted me to be happy...

23:53.109 --> 23:55.042
no matter what else was going on.

23:56.566 --> 23:59.568
Do you think she'd want you
to go through this alone?

24:08.404 --> 24:10.271
I'm here for another look.

24:12.322 --> 24:15.291
You came home after I went
to bed and left before I woke up.

24:15.316 --> 24:16.717
It's this re-programming.

24:16.745 --> 24:19.817
It's so frustrating,
I may start punching things.

24:21.858 --> 24:23.320
Make a list.

24:23.546 --> 24:26.314
Of every single step that is
required to complete your task

24:26.339 --> 24:27.639
and then cross off each...

24:27.690 --> 24:29.691
Shaun, this isn't about
a heavy workload.

24:29.716 --> 24:32.651
It's about doing something
that I know is a waste of time.

24:32.835 --> 24:35.253
But you still need to do it,

24:35.278 --> 24:36.912
and this will solve your issue.

24:36.937 --> 24:38.171
I don't want a solution.

24:38.196 --> 24:40.397
I don't need a solution.
I just want to vent.

24:41.262 --> 24:42.729
Okay.

24:43.145 --> 24:44.679
It is very difficult

24:44.714 --> 24:46.381
to find a cake that everyone likes.

24:46.449 --> 24:47.716
Oh, I get it.

24:49.899 --> 24:51.966
N-No. I don't want to vent.

24:52.055 --> 24:53.589
I just want a solution.

24:53.689 --> 24:55.790
I wish I had one for you,
Shaun, but I don't.

24:55.825 --> 24:58.439
Fresh out of solutions.
The solution well is dry.

25:00.129 --> 25:03.611
Y-You always tell me to use my words

25:03.706 --> 25:06.308
and explain how I'm feeling,
but I did that,

25:06.333 --> 25:08.867
and I think it only made you more upset.

25:09.032 --> 25:11.800
You're right. I'm sorry.

25:14.631 --> 25:19.067
And... you have just solved
my problem, so thank you.

25:28.865 --> 25:31.400
Your baby's still in critical condition,

25:31.425 --> 25:33.641
but we're now treating her
for ethylene glycol poisoning.

25:35.825 --> 25:38.260
We found antifreeze in her blood.

25:38.534 --> 25:40.731
We're forwarding this
information to the authorities.

25:45.007 --> 25:47.242
You can't let this happen.

25:47.443 --> 25:48.677
Not again.

25:50.787 --> 25:52.660
Don't let Meggie die, please.

25:58.521 --> 25:59.941
BP's dropping, heart rate's crashing.

25:59.977 --> 26:01.089
Crash cart!

26:09.473 --> 26:12.471
That's an Ethicure smile.

26:14.484 --> 26:16.485
She might have had a uterine tear

26:16.510 --> 26:17.743
in the wake of her C-section.

26:17.768 --> 26:19.569
We'd see it on the ultrasound.

26:19.594 --> 26:21.429
Ah.

26:21.476 --> 26:22.676
Ah. Badges are gonna have bigger photos,

26:22.711 --> 26:25.312
so we need bigger smiles.

26:25.347 --> 26:27.915
Coag profile and CBC rule out D.I.C.

26:27.940 --> 26:29.053
Bowel perforation?

26:29.086 --> 26:30.599
Park's exposure was...

26:30.624 --> 26:32.258
You can do better than that. Just...

26:35.257 --> 26:36.657
Sunshine!

26:37.893 --> 26:39.373
Next.

26:39.733 --> 26:43.436
Park's exposure was perfect,
as were my sutures.

26:43.461 --> 26:44.628
No perforations.

26:44.653 --> 26:46.063
Now, just imagine

26:46.088 --> 26:49.124
you live somewhere
perpetually warm and sunny.

26:49.250 --> 26:50.968
Wait, you do.

26:52.052 --> 26:53.595
Work with what you got.

26:54.042 --> 26:56.710
Overdistended uterus and atony?

26:56.745 --> 26:59.028
Consistent with time of onset,
clinical history,

26:59.067 --> 27:00.947
and the fact that we
can't stop the bleeding.

27:00.971 --> 27:02.572
Yeah, she needs a hysterectomy.

27:02.606 --> 27:04.857
So she never gets pregnant
again? Win-win.

27:06.510 --> 27:07.985
Win.

27:08.679 --> 27:10.246
She's guilty, Park.
And I'm gonna prove it.

27:10.567 --> 27:12.801
- How?
- I'm gonna ask her.

27:13.984 --> 27:17.654
Salen. Hi. Uh, I'm Lea.

27:17.688 --> 27:19.923
We met in the server room
a few days ago.

27:19.957 --> 27:21.624
You were pretending to be a patient,

27:21.659 --> 27:25.428
which I feel was dishonest
and manipulative

27:25.462 --> 27:26.830
You don't like me. Duly noted.

27:26.864 --> 27:28.598
No, no, I just think it's important

27:28.632 --> 27:30.883
for people to explain
how they're feeling.

27:31.314 --> 27:34.016
I did judge you, but I have
noticed positive things,

27:34.157 --> 27:37.059
like more efficient
sharing of external EHRs

27:37.084 --> 27:39.719
and a streamlined system to
fast-track hospital transfers.

27:39.744 --> 27:43.513
So perhaps I was being too
harsh... Are we going in a...

27:43.538 --> 27:45.472
Just moved up to grudging respect.

27:45.497 --> 27:48.032
And I hope this isn't headed
for fawning admiration.

27:48.219 --> 27:51.521
No. The programming I'm working
on is complicated, redundant,

27:51.555 --> 27:53.122
and, quite frankly, pointless.

27:53.157 --> 27:55.124
I can design something much better.

27:58.068 --> 27:59.568
How long have you been programming?

27:59.620 --> 28:02.565
Four years. Ish.

28:05.069 --> 28:08.504
You went to U Pitt,
got your degree in three years,

28:08.539 --> 28:10.506
designed and built cars, desktops,

28:10.541 --> 28:13.877
and entire coding systems
from the ground up.

28:13.911 --> 28:15.411
And the ransomware attempt
that you thwarted

28:15.479 --> 28:17.554
saved this place a fortune.

28:18.382 --> 28:21.266
And I love that you don't
come from I.T. theory.

28:21.752 --> 28:23.519
You obviously don't come
from sales, either,

28:23.554 --> 28:24.738
because you really don't know

28:24.762 --> 28:25.989
- how to pitch yourself.
- Yeah.

28:26.023 --> 28:28.691
But I'd love to hear about
this better program.

28:28.726 --> 28:30.693
You wanna grab a kombucha?

28:31.034 --> 28:32.301
Yeah.

28:32.554 --> 28:34.021
I-I would love that.

28:36.233 --> 28:38.101
This anesthetic cocktail
of Versed and Pentothal

28:38.168 --> 28:39.952
makes people tell the truth.

28:45.709 --> 28:49.412
Abby? I have a few questions for you.

28:49.446 --> 28:52.589
Not talking to you,
you stone-hearted bitch.

28:53.242 --> 28:54.275
It's working.

28:56.186 --> 28:59.596
Abby, do you know what
happened to your babies?

29:01.976 --> 29:03.270
They are sick.

29:03.294 --> 29:04.977
Do you know why they got sick?

29:07.938 --> 29:09.866
'Cause I'm a bad mother?

29:09.900 --> 29:11.900
Because you gave them antifreeze.

29:15.651 --> 29:17.752
Because I couldn't protect them.

29:20.662 --> 29:22.096
Abby,

29:23.372 --> 29:25.289
did you kill your first baby?

29:26.617 --> 29:28.551
I could never hurt my babies.

29:30.773 --> 29:32.880
I'm their mommy.

29:40.297 --> 29:43.299
These scrubs have very rough seams.

30:07.257 --> 30:09.125
Do you think Audrey would have
made a different decision

30:09.159 --> 30:10.827
if I hadn't been in the room last night?

30:14.537 --> 30:16.138
Do you?

30:18.035 --> 30:20.136
I know she has a personal
interest in Mateo's success,

30:20.170 --> 30:22.705
because he's her boyfriend.

30:22.773 --> 30:24.440
And I think how he appears to me

30:24.475 --> 30:26.683
is important to that success, no?

30:32.383 --> 30:35.685
Audrey is a highly principled
professional and a great boss.

30:39.315 --> 30:40.682
I like you.

30:58.075 --> 30:59.876
You re-ran all the baby's tests?

30:59.910 --> 31:02.311
Using gas chromatography analysis.

31:02.346 --> 31:03.713
In case we missed something.

31:05.214 --> 31:06.381
Good call.

31:08.819 --> 31:10.553
The baby's still in critical condition.

31:10.587 --> 31:13.089
If it is antifreeze,
why isn't she getting better?

31:13.157 --> 31:14.856
I have no idea.

31:17.567 --> 31:19.736
Same, same, same.

31:23.973 --> 31:25.440
I've solved it.

31:27.738 --> 31:30.006
We will stack all five varieties

31:30.040 --> 31:32.208
and serve a quadruple-tiered cake.

31:32.242 --> 31:34.777
Yes, four. Not five.

31:34.845 --> 31:37.013
Five flavors, four tiers,
because Devil's food

31:37.047 --> 31:38.915
and red velvet
are actually both chocolate.

31:38.949 --> 31:40.583
The only difference is
one uses natural cocoa

31:40.617 --> 31:42.051
and the other uses Dutch-process cocoa,

31:42.086 --> 31:43.920
which is alkalized
with potassium carbonate.

31:43.954 --> 31:46.923
A very minor molecular difference.

31:51.395 --> 31:53.429
They're not the same.

31:59.403 --> 32:01.304
A very minor molecular difference.

32:01.371 --> 32:02.738
It's not antifreeze.

32:02.773 --> 32:03.947
It's propionic acid,

32:04.908 --> 32:06.409
which appears identical to antifreeze

32:06.443 --> 32:08.702
on all tests except gas chromatography.

32:10.447 --> 32:13.116
Propionic acid is made by the body,

32:13.150 --> 32:14.717
if that body happens to be afflicted

32:14.751 --> 32:16.986
with methylmalonic acidemia,

32:17.011 --> 32:18.111
which is a genetic condition.

32:18.222 --> 32:20.656
Her first baby probably had it, too.

32:20.724 --> 32:22.725
It was Abby's breast milk,

32:22.759 --> 32:24.127
not because it contained a toxin,

32:24.161 --> 32:25.928
but because it contained proteins

32:25.963 --> 32:27.830
that triggered production of the acid.

32:28.938 --> 32:30.205
She is innocent.

32:45.338 --> 32:47.657
They said I might find you in here.

32:48.838 --> 32:52.040
Something about the big
doughnut I find very calming.

32:56.039 --> 32:57.906
You're here to accept my offer.

32:59.110 --> 33:01.346
I used to be
a pretty decent poker player.

33:01.371 --> 33:02.631
You developed a tell.

33:04.311 --> 33:06.588
How much am I increasing
the clinic budget?

33:06.613 --> 33:07.713
Double.

33:10.347 --> 33:12.413
If that's what it costs
to keep you engaged.

33:12.438 --> 33:15.640
Oh, no. No. You don't have
enough money for that.

33:15.881 --> 33:18.049
The clinic can run
perfectly fine without me.

33:18.083 --> 33:20.399
So can everything else in this place.

33:20.539 --> 33:24.569
I plan on taking my role
as puppet very seriously.

33:26.325 --> 33:28.125
So what do I get for my money?

33:28.160 --> 33:30.826
Exactly what you asked for...
my support.

33:31.129 --> 33:34.865
I plan on smiling and nodding
through this transition,

33:35.020 --> 33:37.755
and nary a negative word
will cross my lips.

33:37.780 --> 33:39.948
That's a much more passive
interpretation of "support"

33:39.973 --> 33:41.240
than I had in mind.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.797
Mmm. I'm not the only one with a tell.

33:46.478 --> 33:48.552
Welcome to the Ethicure family.

33:58.190 --> 34:00.024
We got all of the tumor.

34:00.049 --> 34:02.283
And based on the T Cell
response to your tumor cells,

34:02.361 --> 34:04.025
we're very optimistic.

34:30.656 --> 34:32.637
The day I gave you away,

34:33.391 --> 34:36.226
I put you in the prettiest pink dress

34:37.862 --> 34:39.664
and tied bows in your hair.

34:43.135 --> 34:44.858
I stared at you,

34:45.764 --> 34:49.821
trying to memorize every
curve of your little face.

34:54.679 --> 34:58.182
I started to cry, but you,

35:00.018 --> 35:03.020
you, my strong petite fille,

35:03.055 --> 35:05.489
wiped the tears from my face.

35:08.193 --> 35:10.133
"Don't cry, Maman.

35:11.156 --> 35:12.886
"Don't cry."

35:17.035 --> 35:19.643
I gave my heart away that day,

35:20.238 --> 35:23.271
and over time,
I grew to hate the people who took it,

35:24.443 --> 35:26.066
who took you.

35:37.923 --> 35:41.331
But without their love
and their sacrifice,

35:41.547 --> 35:44.015
you wouldn't be the
amazing girl that you are,

35:45.530 --> 35:47.963
and I love them for that.

35:56.408 --> 35:58.598
Maybe where I come from

35:59.584 --> 36:02.185
has a little bit to do
with how great I am.

36:06.284 --> 36:08.052
Maybe we can be friends.

36:10.335 --> 36:13.655
Work our way up to... Famille.

36:18.663 --> 36:20.731
I would like that very much.

36:27.192 --> 36:30.061
Tell me about your maman.

36:38.516 --> 36:40.682
It wasn't antifreeze
making your baby sick.

36:41.513 --> 36:43.114
She has a metabolic disorder,

36:43.139 --> 36:44.936
which we're treating her for now.

36:45.657 --> 36:47.230
Meggie's gonna be just fine.

37:01.947 --> 37:04.205
We think Troy had the same thing.

37:05.210 --> 37:07.211
You were a victim.

37:07.279 --> 37:09.085
We've let the authorities
know that, too.

37:13.385 --> 37:15.152
I'm sorry, Abby.

37:32.671 --> 37:35.403
Congratulations.

37:36.175 --> 37:38.342
I hear the results of your
procedure were very promising.

37:38.367 --> 37:39.901
You two make quite a team.

37:41.480 --> 37:42.680
Thanks.

37:44.683 --> 37:46.414
Do you have an office?

37:46.898 --> 37:48.298
Maybe.

37:48.323 --> 37:50.557
I remember my assistant
saying something about that.

37:50.689 --> 37:51.856
Uh, do you know what happened

37:51.890 --> 37:54.297
with Bernice Fisher and Derrick Bell?

37:54.793 --> 37:56.758
Your surgeries from yesterday.

37:57.863 --> 38:00.845
I rescheduled them when
I took over Madeline's case.

38:01.927 --> 38:04.862
Did you schedule Derrick
at San Jose General?

38:05.003 --> 38:07.018
Because that's
where he's being treated now.

38:09.941 --> 38:12.243
And what about, uh, Stanley Ferlin,

38:12.277 --> 38:14.245
Kelly Jarnigan, and Thelma Sewell?

38:14.279 --> 38:17.114
Those are my consults, and
I'm seeing them all tomorrow.

38:17.182 --> 38:20.618
Wonderful. Except Kelly was
awaiting cancer biopsy results.

38:20.685 --> 38:23.034
Twenty-four hours is
a lifetime to put that off.

38:25.838 --> 38:27.872
So you're comparing scheduling issues

38:27.897 --> 38:29.564
to saving a young woman's life?

38:29.728 --> 38:32.627
All of our clients'
experiences matter, Mateo.

38:37.402 --> 38:39.342
I understand
your license is provisional.

38:52.397 --> 38:54.364
Who you writing the article with?

38:54.486 --> 38:55.920
I mean, T Cell therapy on melanoma,

38:55.954 --> 38:57.454
it's kind of a big deal.

38:59.824 --> 39:01.959
But, you know, I got to assist
on two appies, a chole,

39:01.993 --> 39:05.095
and a hip replacement, so... there.

39:06.171 --> 39:07.805
Not a lot of steps.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.568
I just hit 11,000.

39:10.602 --> 39:12.136
Mmm. That's impressive.

39:12.170 --> 39:13.504
Mmm-hmm.

39:13.572 --> 39:17.741
'Course it's no 22,378.

39:18.256 --> 39:19.643
It doesn't measure steps.

39:19.678 --> 39:20.744
It measures how many times
you move your wrist

39:20.779 --> 39:22.510
in rhythmic motion.

39:23.609 --> 39:27.178
So you log a quarter-mile
anytime you have some "me time"?

39:27.419 --> 39:29.019
I haven't had any time for that, either.

39:29.087 --> 39:30.654
Mmm.

39:30.689 --> 39:33.157
I just strapped it to a dialysis pump.

39:33.191 --> 39:35.092
- That's clever.
- Mmm.

39:35.126 --> 39:37.328
It's also cheating.

39:37.362 --> 39:39.194
It's only cheating
if the rules have merit.

39:44.129 --> 39:45.867
Vive la revolution.

39:52.544 --> 39:55.846
Regrets are for when you make a mistake,

39:55.880 --> 39:58.115
not for when you do the right thing.

40:00.185 --> 40:02.286
I can handle Dr. Andrews.

40:06.725 --> 40:10.561
After we took his case,
made him look bad?

40:10.629 --> 40:13.353
Andrews is gonna "supervise"
the hell out of you.

40:13.965 --> 40:15.772
I'm not worried.

40:16.681 --> 40:18.348
You know why?

40:19.197 --> 40:21.611
Because, guapa,

40:23.008 --> 40:25.509
I get to see you every day,

40:26.911 --> 40:29.146
and that makes everything wonderful.

40:46.431 --> 40:47.929
I solved our cake problem.

40:49.167 --> 40:51.001
We serve them all?

40:51.036 --> 40:53.404
Kinda brilliant, Shaunie.

40:53.438 --> 40:56.407
I am quite proud of myself.

40:56.441 --> 40:58.409
I solved my problem, too.

40:58.443 --> 41:01.078
I pitched my program idea
to Salen, and she loved it.

41:03.882 --> 41:05.049
Mmm...

41:05.083 --> 41:07.284
This soap is different.

41:07.352 --> 41:10.087
And I'm proud of you, too.

41:10.121 --> 41:13.023
You've done an amazing job
with all these new changes,

41:13.058 --> 41:15.459
especially those scrubs,
which you look super cute in.

41:15.527 --> 41:17.528
What? No. They're itchy.

41:17.562 --> 41:19.263
We'll wash them,

41:19.297 --> 41:21.198
try some unscented fabric softener.

41:21.232 --> 41:23.634
Okay, this soap won't come off.

41:23.702 --> 41:24.968
Okay, no rush.

41:25.036 --> 41:26.614
Paper towels?

41:26.664 --> 41:30.074
Oh. I think they got rid of
them for sanitary reasons.

41:31.743 --> 41:33.977
No! No.

41:34.045 --> 41:35.646
No.

41:35.714 --> 41:37.815
No. S-Stop it. No. Okay.

41:37.882 --> 41:39.083
- Okay, Sha... Oh.
- No.

41:39.117 --> 41:40.884
Stop it.

41:40.919 --> 41:42.619
- I-I can't, Shaun. Breathe.
- Stop it. No, please stop it.

41:43.822 --> 41:45.656
- No. Please. S-Stop it!
- Yeah. It's okay.

41:45.724 --> 41:48.392
- Shaun?
- Stop it! Stop it!

41:48.426 --> 41:51.395
- Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
- You're gonna be okay. Shaun.
