WEBVTT

00:04.337 --> 00:07.048
Whoever issued this,
it’s not yours.

00:07.090 --> 00:08.466
Big red flag.

00:08.508 --> 00:09.968
I can’t leave the dock
with you on board.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.137
-Adios, amigo.
-He didn’t even give me a hug.

00:12.178 --> 00:13.972
Will you be the full-time bosun?

00:14.014 --> 00:15.640
I would love to.

00:17.517 --> 00:18.977
I think Luka has
the right attitude.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.687
He’s smart, he’s quick.

00:20.729 --> 00:23.231
I feel a little distracted
by these ladies.

00:25.525 --> 00:27.527
Me and my boyfriend have been
together for four months.

00:27.569 --> 00:30.321
He wants this open relationship
that I’m so unsure about.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.532
Unfortunately, I felt
the love for him

00:32.574 --> 00:34.659
before I knew that this
is the style he wanted.

00:34.701 --> 00:37.871
I’m deckhands on, like,
ships and, like, tugs and stuff.

00:37.912 --> 00:39.372
Oh, really?

00:39.414 --> 00:40.749
So, like, yachting, like,
I don’t even know.

00:40.790 --> 00:43.001
So it’s us three going
to leave the dock.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.377
We are man down.

00:44.419 --> 00:46.755
It’s only me and Luka
that really knows

00:46.796 --> 00:48.214
what a super yacht is like.

00:48.256 --> 00:49.716
Sh--’s going to go down.

00:49.758 --> 00:51.885
Your crew were
absolutely incredible.

00:51.926 --> 00:55.055
Thank you for stepping up
in a chief stew role,

00:55.096 --> 00:56.681
but then stepping back.

00:57.807 --> 00:59.392
Sure.

00:59.434 --> 01:01.227
If I’ve learned anything,
coming in as a temp Chief Stew,

01:01.269 --> 01:02.562
I just like to be in charge,

01:02.604 --> 01:05.023
because I know how
things should go.

01:05.065 --> 01:08.360
Hi, officially Chief Stew.

01:08.401 --> 01:09.819
And Kyle’s coming later.

01:09.861 --> 01:11.404
Yes.

01:11.446 --> 01:14.032
I met Kyle at the consulate
when I was getting my visa.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.492
Kyle obviously told me
that he had his

01:15.533 --> 01:16.743
ups and downs
with Natalya.

01:16.785 --> 01:19.204
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

01:19.245 --> 01:20.538
So what do you think
of the boat?

01:20.580 --> 01:22.707
The organization’s a sh---show.

01:22.749 --> 01:24.292
-Excuse me?
-I’m not talking about you.

01:24.334 --> 01:26.378
I’m talking about
the actual boat itself.

01:26.419 --> 01:27.712
Been going
pretty bloody well.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.506
No, that’s done.
That’s it.

01:29.547 --> 01:30.882
Don’t do this with me.

01:53.613 --> 01:55.573
The organization’s a sh---show.

01:55.615 --> 01:57.534
-We can run here--
-No, you don’t get defensive.

01:57.575 --> 01:59.077
All I’m saying is...

01:59.119 --> 02:00.495
I’m not getting,
I’m saying...

02:00.537 --> 02:01.996
-Naturally.
-I’ve got my opinion as well.

02:02.038 --> 02:03.623
You’re getting offended.
I’m not offending you.

02:03.665 --> 02:06.084
From your part,
organization’s impeccable

02:06.126 --> 02:07.168
for what you’ve done in a day.

02:07.210 --> 02:08.712
Before you got on this vessel,

02:08.753 --> 02:10.630
the way that it’s set up
is not necessarily

02:10.672 --> 02:13.174
the way that I would want
to walk onto a boat.

02:13.216 --> 02:14.592
That’s all I’m saying.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.428
I think, coming on here,
I’m just telling you

02:16.469 --> 02:17.762
it’s been great
for running, obviously,

02:17.804 --> 02:18.972
-being with this...
-I can give my opinion.

02:19.014 --> 02:20.515
I’m just...

02:20.557 --> 02:21.599
Honestly, I’m just telling
you it’s been great

02:21.641 --> 02:22.642
to have one on each level.

02:22.684 --> 02:23.977
That’s done. That’s it.

02:24.019 --> 02:25.687
-Don’t do this with me.
-That’s it.

02:25.729 --> 02:27.647
Don’t put the hands up
at me, please. Thank you.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.649
Okay.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.736
-Okay, show me the laundry.
-I will show you the laundry.

02:32.777 --> 02:35.155
Clearly, she did a great job
on the charter,

02:35.196 --> 02:37.490
and I would be excited to
work with someone like that.

02:37.532 --> 02:39.534
But also, how would she
like it if someone

02:39.576 --> 02:41.661
started going off the way
that she did in the beginning?

02:41.703 --> 02:43.705
I’m sure she wouldn’t
like it at all.

02:43.747 --> 02:47.542
My mum taught me to stand up
for myself from a young age.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.461
She doesn’t take sh-- at all.

02:49.502 --> 02:52.839
When she cracks the whip?

02:52.881 --> 02:53.840
Run.

02:53.882 --> 02:57.344
So, uniforms.
Yeah, that’s...

02:57.385 --> 02:59.512
I’ve got more laundry
baskets coming tomorrow,

02:59.554 --> 03:01.389
but crew have been putting it
in here in the morning.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.308
When we got to,
like, high school,

03:03.350 --> 03:05.143
boys would play
with our hair

03:05.185 --> 03:07.354
or make comments
about race and stuff.

03:07.395 --> 03:11.024
I’d put them in their place,
and they never tried me again.

03:11.066 --> 03:14.944
So, be kind, but don’t let
them walk all over you.

03:14.986 --> 03:17.322
The iron’s not great,
but it works.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.865
What do you reckon?

03:18.907 --> 03:20.617
There’s a blow-up pizza.

03:20.658 --> 03:21.659
Okay.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.161
There’s a bunch of
sh-- down here.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.497
Okay, well, that is the boat.

03:25.538 --> 03:27.207
Would you like to know
anything else about it?

03:27.248 --> 03:29.376
No, I will ask if I need.

03:29.417 --> 03:32.170
-Perfect.
-All right, thank you.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.171
Pleasure.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.255
Achoo!

03:34.297 --> 03:35.507
[laughing]

03:35.548 --> 03:36.549
I think I just peed a little.

03:36.591 --> 03:37.634
Want to take a chill?

03:37.676 --> 03:39.844
Yeah, let’s go get a breather.

03:41.554 --> 03:43.348
I mean, I already got into
a little bit of a tiff.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.266
-Really?
-Yeah.

03:45.308 --> 03:48.061
She was like, I’ve just got my
opinion that she did this to me.

03:48.103 --> 03:50.063
And I’ve said, don’t ----ing
put your hand up on me.

03:50.105 --> 03:52.190
I’ve said, don’t do this to me.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.608
Uh-uh, and then
she goes, Okay.

03:56.069 --> 03:56.986
Oh, my God.

03:58.571 --> 03:59.864
I love this kind of drama.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.283
You love this kind of drama?
I don’t.

04:02.325 --> 04:03.743
-Hi.
-Hi.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.120
Maybe she’s just trying to...

04:05.161 --> 04:06.413
-Maybe she’s just tired.
-Adapt.

04:06.454 --> 04:08.707
No. There’s no
warmness there.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.750
Jesus Christ, she needs
to appreciate

04:10.792 --> 04:12.377
the fact that
I’ve set up the flow.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.629
The boat’s in a good place,
but there is a correct way

04:14.671 --> 04:18.008
to step into this role and is
to have a respectful hand over

04:18.049 --> 04:21.261
and come in with good energy,
like, be positive.

04:21.302 --> 04:22.721
-Deep breaths.
-Namaste.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.597
I like to, like,
whatever theme you’re doing,

04:24.639 --> 04:25.890
you can just, like,
let me know.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.434
Yeah, I’m pretty good
with menus.

04:27.475 --> 04:28.435
Like, I’ll give you
plenty of warning.

04:28.476 --> 04:30.770
Amazing. Perfect.

04:30.812 --> 04:33.106
Tumi, Jack, Luka,

04:33.148 --> 04:35.942
meet me in the crew mess for
our preference sheet meeting.

04:35.984 --> 04:37.235
Copy that.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.778
-Are you excited?
-Yeah.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.572
Right.

04:47.328 --> 04:50.248
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.292
Goodbye.

04:52.334 --> 04:55.420
This is charter two,
which I’m so happy about.

04:55.462 --> 04:56.796
Looks good.

04:56.838 --> 04:58.757
Mecca Moore-Henson is a
New York-based founder

04:58.798 --> 05:01.134
and publisher of
a lifestyle magazine, Pink.

05:01.176 --> 05:03.136
She and her guests
have achieved success

05:03.178 --> 05:05.096
and like to see
their wealth

05:05.138 --> 05:07.974
by traveling and enjoying
luxurious vacations.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.476
Ooh.

05:09.517 --> 05:11.978
Mecca will be joined
by her husband, Antoine,

05:12.020 --> 05:14.064
Karen, Samantha,
Bobbi, and Janelle,

05:14.105 --> 05:16.608
Joy, and Adjua,
who owns a wellness brand.

05:16.649 --> 05:19.110
-Oh, plant-based.
-Plant-based.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.653
Oh, boy.

05:20.695 --> 05:21.821
How are you with vegan?

05:21.863 --> 05:24.949
-Pretty good.
-Pretty good?

05:24.991 --> 05:26.785
I tried veganism once.

05:26.826 --> 05:28.370
I think it was a Tuesday.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.288
And it lasted about two hours.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.332
I just looked at the weather.

05:32.374 --> 05:34.167
It’s going to be really bad.

05:34.209 --> 05:35.460
Okay.

05:35.502 --> 05:38.171
So we might have to
stay on the dock.

05:38.213 --> 05:39.673
-Just for that day?
-Hopefully.

05:39.714 --> 05:40.882
Yeah.

05:40.924 --> 05:43.718
Mecca is used to cultivating
high-end events.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.679
The vibe must be immaculate.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.848
How do you feel about that?
You got this?

05:48.890 --> 05:49.891
Yeah, I got it.

05:49.933 --> 05:51.685
Dinner on night one
is requested as

05:51.726 --> 05:53.186
a Diamond’s Forever themed meal.

05:53.228 --> 05:56.022
After dinner, guests
we’ll change into pajamas

05:56.064 --> 05:57.816
to enjoy a pajama party.

05:57.857 --> 06:00.235
Late night snacks are a must.

06:00.276 --> 06:02.070
I love a pajama party.

06:02.112 --> 06:03.697
-Okay.
-Perfect.

06:03.738 --> 06:05.031
-All right, have a good night.
-All right, thanks, guys.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.908
Amazing. Thank you.

06:24.592 --> 06:25.885
You’re the chief stew.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.721
You’ve not addressed
my colleague.

06:27.762 --> 06:29.139
Guys, you’re adults.

06:29.180 --> 06:30.432
Have it out between you both.
I don’t need to.

06:30.473 --> 06:31.558
Tash, you are
the chief stew.

06:31.599 --> 06:32.934
What do you want me to say?

06:32.976 --> 06:34.811
Hey, babe.
The new chick just arrived.

06:34.853 --> 06:36.229
I’ve already had a brawl
with her.

06:36.271 --> 06:38.023
She’s a bit of a ----ing
nightmare, but anyway.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.775
This could go downhill
in two days.

06:42.777 --> 06:44.237
I already am in
some weird stuff.

06:44.279 --> 06:45.572
I’m ----ing dating you.

06:45.613 --> 06:46.990
This open relationship
is very new to me.

06:47.032 --> 06:48.742
Like, we haven’t really
discussed

06:48.783 --> 06:50.869
rules or, like, guidelines.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.620
I do find other
people attractive,

06:52.662 --> 06:54.998
and I don’t see myself
sleeping with one person

06:55.040 --> 06:56.207
for the rest of my life,

06:56.249 --> 06:57.751
but it still doesn’t
sit right with me,

06:57.792 --> 07:00.295
my partner sleeping
with someone else.

07:00.337 --> 07:01.588
If you want this life,

07:01.629 --> 07:03.089
then you also have to
meet me halfway

07:03.131 --> 07:05.258
with some of the
stuff that I want.

07:05.300 --> 07:08.136
I’ll talk to you tomorrow,
get some sleep.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.388
All right, love you, bye.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.556
Ugh.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.726
-All right, nice one, bro.
-Good night.

07:20.482 --> 07:22.400
There’s a storm right there.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.569
It’s six miles big.

07:29.824 --> 07:31.743
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.119
-Morning.
-Morning.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.746
Do you want to have
a morning meeting?

07:34.788 --> 07:37.248
We’ll have a proper
meeting with Kyle comes.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.792
The only thing is,
I think we should just finish

07:38.833 --> 07:40.752
the cabins and toiletries.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.962
Sweet, I’ll flip the laundry,
get that rolling,

07:43.004 --> 07:44.464
and then we’ll meet you
in the cabin.

07:44.506 --> 07:45.840
Thank you.

07:49.511 --> 07:50.637
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

07:50.679 --> 07:52.138
-You ready?
-Ready.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.807
It’s going to be a
buffet-style for lunch.

07:53.848 --> 07:57.602
Poached lobster, avocado
and smoked salmon salad,

07:57.644 --> 07:59.437
acep sauce on wild mushrooms.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.439
-A-C-E-P.
-Yeah, some mushroom.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.649
A mushroom sauce.

08:02.691 --> 08:04.317
When it comes to chefs,

08:04.359 --> 08:06.653
I’ve always been really lucky
to have a great relationship

08:06.695 --> 08:08.530
with them because I get them.

08:11.700 --> 08:12.992
Crab arrabbiata.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.953
How do you spell that,
crab p?

08:14.994 --> 08:18.957
Working with Aesha when it was
her first time as a chief stew,

08:18.998 --> 08:21.668
I learned not to let
people walk all over me.

08:21.710 --> 08:23.670
But how many yachts have
you actually worked on?

08:23.712 --> 08:25.630
I don’t know. How many vacuums
have you pushed?

08:25.672 --> 08:27.173
How many ----ing frying pans
have you flipped?

08:27.215 --> 08:29.509
You stick to vacuums,
I’ll stick to cooking.

08:29.551 --> 08:32.303
If there’s one thing I know
about being a chief stew

08:32.345 --> 08:34.806
or any stew is
don’t piss off the chef.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.808
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.519
This doesn’t make
any ----ing sense.

08:39.561 --> 08:42.022
I obviously didn’t do that
right, but it’s holding.

08:42.063 --> 08:46.359
You know how the flag
goes better than I do.

08:46.401 --> 08:48.194
Lara.

08:48.236 --> 08:49.487
[laughing]

08:49.529 --> 08:52.032
Laura, Laura.
It’s ----ing Lara.

08:52.073 --> 08:55.326
As soon as your mouth...
Laura.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.703
It’s like Lara.

08:56.745 --> 08:58.204
You’ve got to smile
when you say it.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.998
I’m not even going to answer
when someone says Laura.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.334
You know?
Just stop.

09:05.587 --> 09:06.838
No.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.673
That sh-- is stupid.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.094
Yeah.

09:14.929 --> 09:16.639
I want to be in
the laundry this whole trip.

09:16.681 --> 09:19.100
After my little shenanigan, I
just want to, like, stay away.

09:19.142 --> 09:21.603
-So I need this folded.
-Okay.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.188
Don’t care how you do it,

09:23.229 --> 09:26.107
whatever your heart desires,
whatever makes you happy.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.909
[grunts]

09:35.950 --> 09:37.285
You thought you’re
done with me?

09:37.327 --> 09:39.704
[laughing]

09:39.746 --> 09:40.955
I’m back.

09:43.375 --> 09:44.876
Coming up...

09:44.918 --> 09:46.961
-Great weather, huh?
-Blade away, bitch.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.922
She is not happy.
Where’s the smiles?

10:03.395 --> 10:03.770
[shrieking]

10:05.522 --> 10:06.940
Oh, my God!

10:06.981 --> 10:08.775
Girl, this thing
is a cruise ship.

10:08.817 --> 10:10.151
I’m not even joking.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.488
I legitimately got lost.

10:13.530 --> 10:15.323
-How are you?
-Excited.

10:15.365 --> 10:16.324
Oh!

10:16.366 --> 10:17.826
Captain Sandy!

10:17.867 --> 10:21.204
Kyle.
Finally, you made it.

10:21.246 --> 10:23.998
Captain Sandy wanting me back
was such a great honor.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.291
To be brought back on
the boat by her,

10:25.333 --> 10:26.835
you’ve got to be
that special kind.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.211
Obviously, there’s no rush,

10:28.253 --> 10:29.713
but to let you know,
we’re ready for service

10:29.754 --> 10:30.714
-when you are.
-Oh, great.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.173
Thank you.

10:32.215 --> 10:33.675
Just to start off class
and then end up messy later.

10:33.717 --> 10:34.968
Exactly.

10:35.010 --> 10:36.803
Did you guys want
something else to drink?

10:36.845 --> 10:39.431
Oh, my God!

10:39.472 --> 10:42.183
I was wishing to be
chief stew this season.

10:42.225 --> 10:45.520
I always want to reach
the next level in any career.

10:45.562 --> 10:46.855
But one day, right?

10:46.896 --> 10:48.356
-Well, I’m going to get to it.
-Okay.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.525
And people will still see
who’s the service queen.

10:50.567 --> 10:53.445
-Welcome back.
-Thank you so much. Woo-hoo!

10:54.738 --> 10:56.489
-Jess.
-Jess.

10:56.531 --> 10:57.490
-Kyle.
-Hi.

10:57.532 --> 10:58.867
Hey, gorgeous.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.660
Oh, good to meet you.
What’s your name?

11:00.702 --> 11:01.870
-Lara and...
-Haleigh.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.204
-Haleigh.
-And Luka.

11:03.246 --> 11:04.289
Luka, okay.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.665
You smell like a dream.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.167
But I feel like broken memories.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.543
Where is my Australian sister?

11:08.585 --> 11:09.878
In the laundry.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.254
Of course, you know
where she is, hey?

11:11.296 --> 11:12.255
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

11:12.297 --> 11:14.841
[screaming]

11:17.635 --> 11:19.095
[laughing]

11:19.137 --> 11:21.931
I’m genuinely so excited
to see Natalya.

11:21.973 --> 11:24.184
Kyle and I’s relationship,
we’re like brother and sister.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.061
Like, we got a bit rocky at
the end of last season.

11:26.102 --> 11:28.730
There’s no head of housekeeping.
Do not try to blame me.

11:28.772 --> 11:30.273
-No.
-No one blamed you?

11:30.315 --> 11:31.733
No, because you’ve just
said the head of housekeeping

11:31.775 --> 11:32.901
was not here, Kyle.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.069
You didn’t hear the full story.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.403
-Bullsh--.
-Pipe down.

11:35.445 --> 11:36.863
I’m literally the most
calmest person.

11:36.905 --> 11:38.656
I’m ----ing calm.
----ing sh--.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.700
Kyle’s very good at
lightening up a situation.

11:40.742 --> 11:42.285
We have a lot of fun moments.

11:42.327 --> 11:44.746
-Slow, Kyle.
-Look how dirty you are.

11:44.788 --> 11:46.790
It’s gross!

11:46.831 --> 11:49.250
I mean, Natalya gets
her panties in a twist.

11:49.292 --> 11:51.336
I don’t wear any panties
or any underwear, really.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.713
Can’t handle the heat.
then step out of the kitchen.

11:53.755 --> 11:54.714
How’s things been going?

11:54.756 --> 11:56.174
Did a walkthrough with her.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.967
Not even a thanks for
taking the first charter,

11:58.009 --> 11:59.469
just say nothing.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.394
[laughing]

12:07.435 --> 12:08.895
Interior, interior,
can we have a meeting

12:08.937 --> 12:10.647
in the crew mess, please?

12:10.689 --> 12:12.857
Copy.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.442
Oh damn, it looks like
dicks out here.

12:14.484 --> 12:18.071
Doing sh-- that I’m not
used to, it’s hard for me,

12:18.113 --> 12:21.074
-so I’m trying to like...
-Just take it in.

12:21.116 --> 12:23.952
Yeah, like, I love line sh--.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.210
It’s hard for me to
just hang out

12:32.252 --> 12:34.629
when I’m used to like,
the adrenaline and like,

12:34.671 --> 12:36.131
the exciting parts of boats.

12:36.172 --> 12:37.549
Sitting on the dock,

12:37.590 --> 12:39.259
I don’t really know
what I should be doing.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.554
If I was on the tugs,
I can chip and paint something,

12:42.595 --> 12:45.265
but the yacht,
it’s a floating hotel.

12:45.306 --> 12:48.351
And if it’s not moving,
there’s nothing for me to do.

12:48.393 --> 12:51.104
Besides hose the ----ing
charter guests off.

12:54.190 --> 12:56.192
So, I’m really excited.

12:56.234 --> 12:58.611
-Hey, ho, so.
-Let’s go.

12:58.653 --> 13:00.113
Let’s go.

13:00.155 --> 13:02.574
I think my management style
is relatively relaxed.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.951
Before yachting, I was
in a management position

13:04.993 --> 13:06.202
when I was in the restaurants,

13:06.244 --> 13:07.829
but then I would
manage the girls

13:07.871 --> 13:09.414
because we also had a club.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.541
Every weekend, I would have
to find models so that men

13:11.583 --> 13:13.001
could come into the club.

13:13.043 --> 13:15.378
Constantly dealing with
different personalities as well.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.964
I know there’s gonna be a
real learning curve for me,

13:18.006 --> 13:20.216
but I feel very well prepared.

13:20.258 --> 13:23.636
Okay, so I am super
big on ranks.

13:23.678 --> 13:25.055
I just believe in it.

13:26.556 --> 13:27.891
So, Kyle...

13:29.851 --> 13:32.187
Obviously.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.856
Obviously, why is that
so obvious Tumi? Why?

13:34.898 --> 13:36.608
You’re gonna be my late stew.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.610
And Natalya, I’m gonna
make you third.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.446
I’ve heard about how you’re
so good at housekeeping,

13:41.488 --> 13:43.990
and I feel like I don’t need
to bloody stress about it.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.617
Housekeeping laundry,
I got ya.

13:45.658 --> 13:46.868
Okay, cool.

13:46.910 --> 13:48.203
And I would like you up
for breakfast,

13:48.244 --> 13:49.579
and then you can just
like set the table

13:49.621 --> 13:51.081
and then I’ll come
do service with you.

13:51.122 --> 13:53.750
And then Jess, I’m gonna
make you fourth.

13:53.792 --> 13:55.126
Copy.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.170
This decision was based off
their CVs.

13:57.212 --> 13:59.214
Kyle is really good with people.

13:59.255 --> 14:00.840
So that’s service.

14:00.882 --> 14:02.550
So normally when someone’s
really good at service,

14:02.592 --> 14:04.010
they’re a second.

14:04.052 --> 14:07.055
Natalya is really good with
housekeeping and laundry.

14:07.097 --> 14:08.890
So third would be perfect

14:08.932 --> 14:10.725
because she can also
manage Jessica.

14:10.767 --> 14:13.645
I think like I’m happy to always
do day heads and stuff,

14:13.687 --> 14:15.355
like, but you know,
if someone sees something,

14:15.397 --> 14:16.564
please just take
initiative and do it.

14:16.606 --> 14:18.149
Yeah, of course.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.902
It’s kind of a relief to go
to the bottom of the food chain

14:20.944 --> 14:23.863
because less stress
down there.

14:23.905 --> 14:26.700
There’s drama at the top,
and I don’t like it.

14:26.741 --> 14:28.201
It makes me uncomfortable.

14:28.243 --> 14:30.120
-Okay, let’s just go.
-Okay.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.414
What’s happening, guys?

14:32.455 --> 14:34.082
We’re just gonna put
one more line out.

14:34.124 --> 14:35.542
More laundry.

14:35.583 --> 14:39.129
I tried to organize this
cupboard to my best ability.

14:41.131 --> 14:42.132
Oh, thanks, baby.

14:42.173 --> 14:43.425
Babe, do you want a sous chef?

14:43.466 --> 14:45.510
I don’t want to be
in the interior.

14:48.179 --> 14:49.973
No, no, no, trust me.

14:50.849 --> 14:52.308
I’m not vibing.

14:52.350 --> 14:53.768
I don’t want to go
into any dramas

14:53.810 --> 14:55.270
-or that sh--.
-Yeah.

14:55.311 --> 14:57.522
Hello.

14:57.564 --> 14:58.606
Oh, that’s him?

14:58.648 --> 14:59.607
I don’t know, maybe.

14:59.649 --> 15:00.942
Hola, people.

15:00.984 --> 15:02.902
-Hey. How’s it going?
-I’m Max. Good.

15:02.944 --> 15:04.863
Sorry.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.114
I have a meeting
with the captain.

15:06.156 --> 15:08.158
Yeah, you can come on
and go see her.

15:08.199 --> 15:09.367
-She’ll be up on the bridge.
-Yeah?

15:09.409 --> 15:10.452
Yeah.

15:10.493 --> 15:12.245
Push.

15:12.287 --> 15:13.288
-Nice to meet you.
-Luka.

15:13.329 --> 15:14.581
-Max.
-Nice to meet you.

15:14.622 --> 15:16.291
Hola, madame.
What’s your name?

15:16.332 --> 15:17.334
-Lara.
-Lara.

15:17.375 --> 15:18.626
-And?
-Haleigh.

15:18.668 --> 15:21.087
Haleigh, nice to meet you.
My name is Max.

15:21.129 --> 15:24.299
I’m French,
I speak good English.

15:24.341 --> 15:27.719
I have been fired from
all the jobs since I’m 18.

15:27.761 --> 15:31.139
I am the misunderstood, but
because I’m a ---ing animal,

15:31.181 --> 15:33.767
like a French bulldog,
you know? Rar, you know?

15:43.026 --> 15:44.569
-Hello, Captain.
-Welcome aboard.

15:44.611 --> 15:45.862
Thank you so much.

15:45.904 --> 15:47.322
-Great weather, huh?
-Yeah.

15:48.365 --> 15:49.532
Yeah.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.117
Yeah, well, I’m so happy
to have you here.

15:51.159 --> 15:52.285
Thank you so much.
I appreciate it.

15:52.327 --> 15:53.495
I want to connect you to Luka.

15:53.536 --> 15:56.331
Just have him sit your cabin.

16:03.213 --> 16:04.297
What is your position?

16:04.339 --> 16:05.715
-Bosun.
-Bosun?

16:05.757 --> 16:07.550
Where about did you come from?

16:08.885 --> 16:10.512
Oh, sweet.

16:15.350 --> 16:16.851
So what?
I change and I, you know?

16:16.893 --> 16:18.520
Yeah, chuck some uniform on.

16:21.439 --> 16:22.607
We’re picking
up this afternoon.

16:22.649 --> 16:23.525
-Are we?
-Yeah.

16:23.566 --> 16:24.776
But we’re not leaving the dock.

16:24.818 --> 16:26.319
-We’re going to stay here.
-Okay.

16:26.361 --> 16:28.488
Vegan. Hate this sh--.

16:28.530 --> 16:31.241
All crew, all crew,
provision guys here.

16:31.282 --> 16:32.701
Okay, good.

16:32.742 --> 16:34.035
Tomorrow, I’m thinking
bright, sunny skies.

16:34.077 --> 16:35.203
Staying positive.

16:35.245 --> 16:36.955
Got so much to do.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.832
I’m not normally this lazy,
but I don’t want to be wet now.

16:38.873 --> 16:40.000
Only tonight.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.710
[laughing]

16:43.211 --> 16:44.713
Big, juicy melons.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.840
Because it’s teamwork
that...

16:46.881 --> 16:49.259
-Makes the dream work!
-Makes the dream work!

16:49.300 --> 16:51.511
Oh, I just took out
my hoo-ha on the corner.

16:51.553 --> 16:53.513
Good job, guys.
That was smooth.

16:53.555 --> 16:56.975
-But you are alone. Huh?
-You are alone.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.059
-What?
-You are alone.

16:58.101 --> 17:00.562
-No one is sous chef.
-No, no.

17:00.603 --> 17:01.730
-You are by yourself.
-Yeah.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.148
All crew, all crew.

17:03.189 --> 17:05.191
In your whites now,
let’s meet on the dock.

17:05.233 --> 17:06.401
So it’s been...

17:06.443 --> 17:07.986
I’m trying to hold back things.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.487
Interesting.

17:09.529 --> 17:10.864
And it’s only going to get
more interesting.

17:10.905 --> 17:12.240
This is how we’re starting?

17:12.282 --> 17:13.616
The drama, girl.

17:13.658 --> 17:16.244
This is going to be good
for absolutely no one.

17:16.286 --> 17:17.620
And now I’m in the middle.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.080
And I prefer
the front or the back.

17:19.122 --> 17:20.415
And everybody knows that

17:20.457 --> 17:22.334
that knows me will tell
you the same thing.

17:23.585 --> 17:25.086
First night, she
messaged me about you.

17:25.128 --> 17:26.546
What did she say?

17:29.257 --> 17:30.884
Yeah, good.
Go ahead, hon. Go ahead.

17:30.925 --> 17:32.802
I’m off to Mykonos.
I don’t really give a sh--.

17:32.844 --> 17:34.304
You’re not leaving.

17:35.138 --> 17:36.639
[laughing]

17:39.809 --> 17:41.269
Hi!

17:41.311 --> 17:45.523
I’m going to need a
masseuse at 3 p.m. today.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.609
Uh, I don’t have socks,
my friends.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.235
-You don’t have any socks?
-No.

17:49.277 --> 17:50.487
You can use some of mine.

17:50.528 --> 17:52.781
-You didn’t bring any socks?
-No.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.407
Blade away, bitch.

17:54.449 --> 17:56.284
All crew, all crew,
guest arrival.

17:56.326 --> 17:57.786
Let’s meet on the dock.

17:57.827 --> 17:58.787
Booyah!

18:03.583 --> 18:04.918
Yay!

18:04.959 --> 18:06.670
My New York friend.

18:06.711 --> 18:09.255
I cannot believe this
is the weather right now.

18:09.297 --> 18:11.257
She is not happy.

18:11.299 --> 18:12.967
-Cold-ass rain.
-Yeah, that’s some bullsh--.

18:13.009 --> 18:15.887
All right, please go
meet them at the gate.

18:15.929 --> 18:18.139
You’re stressing us
out over this sh--.

18:18.181 --> 18:19.474
Where’s the smiles?

18:19.516 --> 18:21.518
First charter as chief stew.

18:21.559 --> 18:23.895
And this is it?
Bad weather.

18:23.937 --> 18:26.272
We’re stuck at the dock.
Issues with Natalya.

18:26.314 --> 18:28.483
Guests that look
really pissed off.

18:28.525 --> 18:30.860
[bleep].
This is not ideal.

18:32.195 --> 18:34.114
-Mm-mm.
-----ed up.

18:34.155 --> 18:35.365
Coming up...

18:35.407 --> 18:36.658
Tumi, how much
longer for lunch?

18:36.700 --> 18:37.867
I’m going to check
with the chef.

18:37.909 --> 18:39.160
What, are they getting restless?

18:39.202 --> 18:40.412
We’re looking forward
to the food.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.996
Would I be able to get
one of the girls

18:42.038 --> 18:43.540
-in here as well, please?
-That’s why I’m here.

18:43.581 --> 18:44.833
You must be enjoying
the [bleep] out of this.

18:44.874 --> 18:45.834
Yep.

18:52.549 --> 18:53.758
This is going to suck.

18:56.177 --> 18:57.345
Yeah.

18:57.387 --> 18:58.805
Hello.
Welcome on board.

18:58.847 --> 19:00.140
-Hi.
-Hi.

19:00.181 --> 19:02.017
-How are you?
-Hello.

19:02.058 --> 19:03.351
Hi.

19:03.393 --> 19:04.644
We were hoping you would
bring the sunshine.

19:04.686 --> 19:06.271
-All right.
-Look, you brought it.

19:06.312 --> 19:07.439
I think you brought it.
I’m Mecca.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.441
-Welcome.
-Ooh, a Black girl.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.775
[overlapping dialogue]

19:16.698 --> 19:18.408
-Champagne, maybe?
-Champagne.

19:19.868 --> 19:23.246
So, unfortunately, we have
to stay on the dock today.

19:23.288 --> 19:24.664
-Yep.
-Mm-hmm.

19:24.706 --> 19:26.958
-It’s so rough off shore.
-But tomorrow?

19:27.000 --> 19:28.001
Let’s see.

19:28.043 --> 19:29.169
You’re going to
make magic happen.

19:29.210 --> 19:30.795
See?

19:30.837 --> 19:33.173
Well, our chief stew, Tumi,
is going to show you around.

19:33.214 --> 19:34.966
Cheers, everyone.

19:37.385 --> 19:38.678
So, I’m going to give you
a tour of the boat.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.430
So, we’re going to go up.

19:40.472 --> 19:43.266
So, because it’s raining,
the cushion’s aren’t out.

19:43.308 --> 19:46.353
That’s your jacuzzi,
where all the action happens.

19:46.394 --> 19:50.065
I will be living right here.
Fabulous.

19:55.403 --> 19:56.363
Oh, yeah, that’s
perfect, right?

19:56.404 --> 19:57.614
Yeah.

19:57.655 --> 19:58.782
I’ve even called you
a masseuse.

20:00.533 --> 20:03.203
-We go down this side.
-Down the stairs.

20:03.244 --> 20:05.538
So, this is your
bridge deck aft.

20:05.580 --> 20:07.415
-Nice.
-This is Mecca-approved.

20:07.457 --> 20:08.875
This arrangement.
It’s pretty.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.377
-You guys got to bring it.
-My favorite thing.

20:10.418 --> 20:12.837
-Oh, I know that’s right.
-Woo!

20:12.879 --> 20:14.756
He’s the best bosun
I’ve ever had.

20:14.798 --> 20:17.050
How do you feel
about stepping back?

20:17.092 --> 20:19.719
She texted Kyle saying,
Natalya better watch it.

20:19.761 --> 20:21.513
I’ve no problem firing her.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.182
Do you think Kyle
said something about you

20:24.224 --> 20:25.725
and it made her think something?

20:25.767 --> 20:27.060
I don’t really give a sh--.

20:27.102 --> 20:29.396
Okay, let’s go down
to your rooms.

20:29.437 --> 20:31.690
Oh, I’m getting lost and dizzy.

20:31.731 --> 20:32.982
There’s no elevator?

20:33.024 --> 20:36.361
This is the master
cabin for our queen.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.779
Oh, my God.

20:37.821 --> 20:39.239
-It’s pretty.
-Yeah.

20:39.280 --> 20:42.075
Do you know what time
we’re starting lunch?

20:42.117 --> 20:43.451
Hopefully, later.

20:43.493 --> 20:46.454
I’m going to get the bags
and for you.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.252
-Okay.
-Yeah.

20:52.293 --> 20:53.795
We can do it.

20:55.005 --> 20:55.964
Boss sh--.

20:56.006 --> 20:57.257
-I’ll let the chef know.
-Yeah.

20:57.298 --> 20:58.758
I didn’t have breakfast.

21:01.344 --> 21:02.637
Chef, how soon
can we do lunch?

21:02.679 --> 21:04.014
They’re real hungry.

21:04.055 --> 21:05.932
Can we offer them this
cheese and cookies?

21:05.974 --> 21:08.268
I tried to offer.
They’re not keen.

21:08.309 --> 21:10.812
Okay, well, I’m gonna need 30
minutes down to go together.

21:10.854 --> 21:12.981
-30 minutes for lunch.
-Yeah.

21:13.023 --> 21:15.275
Chef can get lunch
ready in 30 minutes.

21:15.316 --> 21:18.028
Oh, yeah, by the time they
get upstairs, that’s fine.

21:18.069 --> 21:19.529
We’re going to get
into our reds.

21:19.571 --> 21:20.947
All right, you guys
go grab some food,

21:20.989 --> 21:23.533
and then could you give
Cheffy a hand with dishes?

21:26.244 --> 21:27.162
The charcuterie board?

21:28.496 --> 21:29.497
Yeah, I know.

21:29.539 --> 21:31.750
-But, Babe...
-Okay.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.209
Okay, so I’ll put everything
we’re doing

21:33.251 --> 21:34.627
-outside the dining table.
-Perfect.

21:34.669 --> 21:37.756
You put it here?
You put it here?

21:37.797 --> 21:39.132
-Inside.
-Oh, inside?

21:39.174 --> 21:40.133
-Okay.
-Yeah.

21:40.175 --> 21:41.217
Obviously.

21:41.259 --> 21:44.012
I’m trying to figure
out your accent.

21:44.054 --> 21:45.722
Oh, yeah?

21:45.764 --> 21:47.599
No, I don’t know what
the [bleep] he’s saying.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.309
No, no, it’s going to be good.

21:49.351 --> 21:50.685
-You do plates...
-Gotcha.

21:50.727 --> 21:51.895
-And knives and forks.
-Gotcha.

21:51.936 --> 21:54.314
And glasses.

21:54.356 --> 21:55.273
Babe, I’m not not up there.

21:58.693 --> 21:59.944
I don’t like being rushed,

21:59.986 --> 22:01.613
because I want everything
to look amazing.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.156
I’m going to throw it on
a ----ing plate,

22:03.198 --> 22:04.324
like a caveman.

22:04.366 --> 22:06.034
Why can’t we just slow
it down a bit,

22:06.076 --> 22:07.118
and, like, it’s going
to be 10 more minutes,

22:07.160 --> 22:08.953
but it’s going to look better.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.163
If I feel rushed,
that’s when I’m going to start

22:10.205 --> 22:11.331
getting pissed off.

22:11.373 --> 22:12.624
Tumi, how much
longer for lunch?

22:12.665 --> 22:13.625
I’m going to check
with the chef.

22:13.667 --> 22:14.918
Thank you.

22:14.959 --> 22:16.628
-Cheffy..
-What are they getting restless?

22:16.670 --> 22:17.962
Let’s eat, let’s eat.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.714
It’ll be ready
in about 15 minutes.

22:19.756 --> 22:21.007
What’s going on with the cheese?

22:21.049 --> 22:22.509
The cheese?
They don’t want it.

22:22.550 --> 22:23.677
No, because you went
to take the wrapper off,

22:23.718 --> 22:24.803
but then you walked away.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.846
They don’t want it.

22:26.888 --> 22:28.848
It looks like the
rain stopped a bit,

22:28.890 --> 22:30.725
so we’ll have some food
and maybe dry.

22:30.767 --> 22:32.686
The chef should be
about 10 minutes.

22:32.727 --> 22:33.728
10 minutes. Okay.

22:33.770 --> 22:35.313
This is going to sound crazy,

22:35.355 --> 22:38.817
but my ideal charter guest
is a chaotic charter guest.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.402
Tumi, so we go outside?

22:40.443 --> 22:41.403
We can get seated now.

22:41.444 --> 22:43.029
Ooh!

22:43.071 --> 22:44.698
Growing up with six siblings,
like, it’s just natural.

22:44.739 --> 22:46.533
This is why I don’t
work on private boats,

22:46.574 --> 22:47.659
because I get bored.

22:47.701 --> 22:50.036
I am here to bust my ass.

22:50.078 --> 22:51.121
That’s where I thrive.

22:51.162 --> 22:53.540
-[glass clinks]
-Ooh! Cheers.

22:53.581 --> 22:56.418
Natalya, do you mind running
up to the bridge deck bar?

22:56.459 --> 22:57.669
Copy.

22:59.337 --> 23:01.089
That guy is so...

23:02.757 --> 23:03.842
Don’t like being rushed.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.719
Are you going to
try some bread?

23:05.760 --> 23:06.678
-It’s fresh.
-Fresh bread?

23:06.720 --> 23:08.138
Yeah. He makes it.

23:11.516 --> 23:12.684
You’ll see.

23:12.726 --> 23:13.768
Still or sparkling?

23:13.810 --> 23:15.061
-Still is fine.
-Okay.

23:15.103 --> 23:16.730
I wonder what
we’re going to eat.

23:16.771 --> 23:18.231
What do you need?

23:18.273 --> 23:19.524
I just need to fill up with
some Pellegrino , yeah?

23:19.566 --> 23:20.692
That’s okay, baby.

23:20.734 --> 23:22.110
I did leave things
pretty open.

23:22.152 --> 23:23.611
I made its clear we’re
all very well-traveled,

23:23.653 --> 23:25.030
so we want to try some stuff.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.698
We’re looking forward
to the food.

23:26.740 --> 23:29.242
You must be enjoying the
[bleep] out of this, be honest.

23:29.284 --> 23:31.745
I’m down in laundry to save
my ----ing life.

23:36.833 --> 23:39.169
The chef is the best thing
about this ----ing boat.

23:39.210 --> 23:40.587
How are we going?

23:40.628 --> 23:42.756
We can start slowly.

23:45.133 --> 23:46.968
I don’t know, it never works.

23:47.010 --> 23:48.386
I just can’t bite my tongue,

23:48.428 --> 23:50.096
because I just think
if you’re being unfair,

23:50.138 --> 23:51.890
then you need to be told
that you’re being unfair.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.351
At school, against
my science teacher,

23:54.392 --> 23:57.896
my house had just been in a fire
and she was always rude to me.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.272
She was like, oh, Natalya,

23:59.314 --> 24:00.565
it was the only thing
you were able to save

24:00.607 --> 24:02.484
was your sports uniform?

24:02.525 --> 24:04.903
And I just remember kicking
the Bunsen burner

24:04.944 --> 24:06.780
that was on the desk
towards the teacher.

24:06.821 --> 24:08.114
Would I be able to get
one of the girls

24:08.156 --> 24:09.449
to help me with the platters?

24:09.491 --> 24:10.408
That’s why I’m here.

24:12.243 --> 24:13.787
She’s come in here
with a bone to pick,

24:13.828 --> 24:16.122
but guess what?
She’s picked the wrong bone.

24:16.164 --> 24:17.415
At this point,
let’s just sack her

24:17.457 --> 24:18.958
and then I’ll
just step up again.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.835
I’m not assisting if
I’ve been told

24:20.877 --> 24:23.171
I’m getting fired easy, so...

24:32.430 --> 24:33.515
-Did she say actual food?
-We’re starving.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.393
So, this is the lobster salad,
ready?

24:36.434 --> 24:38.645
-Copy.
-That’s the tomato and onion.

24:38.687 --> 24:40.605
Copy, thank you.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.315
Do you have a black tray
by you somewhere?

24:42.357 --> 24:44.109
Yeah. Do you want to use
that one?

24:44.150 --> 24:46.403
I’m going to make
some lime juice.

24:46.444 --> 24:47.821
I love that.

24:47.862 --> 24:51.324
My responsibilities may
have decreased a bit.

24:51.366 --> 24:54.244
One. Two.

24:54.285 --> 24:56.162
But, like, just keep
the conflict away from me

24:56.204 --> 24:57.664
at all costs.

24:57.706 --> 24:58.998
Cheffy, let me if I can do
anything right at this moment.

24:59.040 --> 25:00.834
Yeah, I need
platters up, please.

25:00.875 --> 25:03.086
In school, bickers
and arguments about things

25:03.128 --> 25:05.005
gave me such bad anxiety.

25:05.046 --> 25:07.340
I went into cheerleading
in ninth grade.

25:07.382 --> 25:09.676
It was so much pressure.

25:09.718 --> 25:11.177
Your team is getting upset.

25:11.219 --> 25:14.055
If you mess up, I just,
like, lost confidence in myself,

25:14.097 --> 25:17.267
like, nah, [bleep] this.
I quit.

25:17.308 --> 25:18.601
There we go.

25:18.643 --> 25:20.270
It’s almost two.
We still haven’t eaten yet.

25:20.311 --> 25:22.147
We’re happy with our position?

25:22.188 --> 25:25.525
I was thinking we pull up on
the ground lines a bit more.

25:25.567 --> 25:26.860
I agree.

25:26.901 --> 25:28.278
Right, we got steak
and mushroom sauce.

25:28.319 --> 25:30.530
Deck crew, could you meet
me up on the bow?

25:30.572 --> 25:32.365
Ooh, yes.

25:32.407 --> 25:34.200
We’re going to try and
come off the dock like a meter.

25:34.242 --> 25:35.994
If you guys pull up on these,

25:36.036 --> 25:37.203
I’m going to go to the back
and keep an eye on it.

25:37.245 --> 25:38.621
And we’ve got a
vegan alternative

25:38.663 --> 25:40.415
-coming for you now, okay?
-Okay.

25:40.457 --> 25:41.416
What’s in this?

25:42.917 --> 25:44.002
That smells good.

25:44.044 --> 25:46.212
Back to cabins, I go.

25:46.254 --> 25:47.380
We’ll inch it up more.

25:47.422 --> 25:48.423
Yeah.

25:48.465 --> 25:49.883
Okay, would you
like some tomatoes ?

25:49.924 --> 25:50.884
Yes, please.

25:50.925 --> 25:52.177
Everything looks so good.

25:52.218 --> 25:54.262
I hope it tastes as
good as it looks.

25:54.304 --> 25:56.222
We’re looking good,
nice and tight.

25:56.264 --> 25:58.433
Haleigh, Haleigh, Luka, do you
want to go on a two-hour break?

25:58.475 --> 25:59.768
Yes.

25:59.809 --> 26:01.478
Can’t have you
burning out, girl.

26:01.519 --> 26:04.230
It’s just a little avocado
pumpkin seed salad.

26:04.272 --> 26:06.066
-Do they seem happy?
-They’re fine.

26:06.107 --> 26:08.193
Do you want to start drying up
on the sundeck?

26:08.234 --> 26:09.569
-Sundeck and come down.
-Yeah.

26:09.611 --> 26:11.696
-This is good. It’s good.
-Delicious.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.865
This is for our lovely vegan.

26:13.907 --> 26:15.200
It’s just like
an avo salad.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.660
Yeah, let’s go dry everything,
huh?

26:17.702 --> 26:19.412
Yeah, do you want to go up to
the sundeck and help Lara?

26:19.454 --> 26:20.413
Yeah, sure.

26:20.455 --> 26:21.498
Is it to your liking?

26:21.539 --> 26:22.832
Well, it’s just asparagus.

26:25.293 --> 26:27.712
-Why?
-To help you.

26:27.754 --> 26:29.255
My Lord, how’s it going?

26:29.297 --> 26:30.674
Good.

26:30.715 --> 26:32.884
You’re ----ing living
the dream down here, right?

26:32.926 --> 26:35.095
This is like the quiet zone.

26:35.136 --> 26:37.055
Like, what the [bleep] is this?

26:40.100 --> 26:41.434
When does he wear that?

26:41.476 --> 26:42.936
His junk’s not that big.

26:42.977 --> 26:44.938
If I was in a monoga...
monogamous.

26:44.979 --> 26:46.523
If I was in a "monoganmonus..."

26:46.564 --> 26:48.108
If I was in a monog-- [bleep].

26:48.149 --> 26:50.485
If I was in a
monogamous relationship,

26:50.527 --> 26:52.445
I wouldn’t be flirting,
but I’m not.

26:52.487 --> 26:53.530
So, hello, Luka.

26:53.571 --> 26:55.615
I would love to
have a cuddle with him,

26:55.657 --> 26:57.617
and I think I’m allowed to,
but I’m still...

26:57.659 --> 26:59.119
It’s a question mark.

26:59.160 --> 27:00.495
My whole relationship right now
is a question mark,

27:00.537 --> 27:02.080
and I am just confused.

27:02.122 --> 27:03.206
Do you want to put it on?

27:03.248 --> 27:04.791
I’m not putting those on.

27:04.833 --> 27:08.003
Now how are we rating
this vegan meal you’re having?

27:08.044 --> 27:10.005
I would give it a six.

27:10.046 --> 27:11.631
Well, goddamn.

27:11.673 --> 27:13.967
Tumi, pasta is kind of easy.

27:14.009 --> 27:15.969
You got to be more creative,

27:16.011 --> 27:17.303
and you got to dig in
your bag a little bit.

27:17.345 --> 27:18.555
Don’t tell Chef, but tell him.

27:18.596 --> 27:19.848
-I’ll let him know.
-It was good.

27:19.889 --> 27:21.349
-We just want more.
-Okay.

27:21.391 --> 27:23.852
I have high expectations
just letting y’all know.

27:25.186 --> 27:26.813
We expect something very grand.

27:26.855 --> 27:28.023
Oh, sh--.

27:28.064 --> 27:29.357
I hate that I’m like that.

27:29.399 --> 27:31.026
No, you’re Pisces.
Can’t help it.

27:31.067 --> 27:32.944
-We can do tam-tam?
-What is tam-tam?

27:32.986 --> 27:35.780
Yeah, you can tam-tam.

27:35.822 --> 27:38.158
You do tam-tam?

27:38.199 --> 27:40.076
Can we tam-tam,
what the [bleep]?

27:40.118 --> 27:42.996
Before I forget,
the vegan gave it a six,

27:43.038 --> 27:44.664
and she wants a ten.

27:44.706 --> 27:46.833
To be honest, I wasn’t
happy with that vegan itself.

27:46.875 --> 27:47.834
A bit rushed,
you know what I mean?

27:47.876 --> 27:48.877
No, this was...

27:48.918 --> 27:51.296
This was rushed, even for me.

27:53.173 --> 27:55.342
She’s going to be a thorn in
my ass all this trip.

27:55.383 --> 27:57.469
I can feel it.

27:57.510 --> 27:58.970
-Careful, there’s bee.
-There’s a bee?

27:59.012 --> 27:59.971
Yeah.

28:00.013 --> 28:01.014
I’m scared of insects.

28:01.056 --> 28:02.432
Are you from South Africa?

28:02.474 --> 28:04.559
Yeah, but I don’t like
spiders or insects.

28:04.601 --> 28:06.061
You have monkey in the streets.

28:06.102 --> 28:08.271
Yes, we have monkeys
in the houses.

28:08.313 --> 28:10.982
Okay, so I just wanted
to discuss dinner with you.

28:11.024 --> 28:13.193
I think we’ll sit
maybe like 8:30.

28:13.234 --> 28:14.861
8:30.
Okay, copy.

28:14.903 --> 28:15.987
Is the masseuse on the way?

28:16.029 --> 28:18.031
-Yes.
-Yes!

28:18.073 --> 28:20.533
That’s who we all waiting for!

28:20.575 --> 28:22.869
Kyle, I appreciate you.

28:22.911 --> 28:24.704
What’s going on?

28:24.746 --> 28:26.164
I just appreciate you.

28:26.206 --> 28:28.375
I know you’re talking sh--.
What’s up?

28:28.416 --> 28:30.460
[laughing]
I’m kidding.

28:30.502 --> 28:32.170
-How does it feel?
-Feels so good.

28:32.212 --> 28:34.047
-Hi!
-Hi.

28:34.089 --> 28:36.174
-How are you?
-Fine, thanks, and you?

28:36.216 --> 28:38.677
I’m good.
My name’s Tumi.

28:38.718 --> 28:42.055
God, this guy’s beautiful.

28:42.097 --> 28:43.556
We’re stuck at the dock,

28:43.598 --> 28:45.100
but at the same time,
these are the type of things

28:45.141 --> 28:47.644
that distract guests
and make them happy.

28:47.686 --> 28:49.562
So you let me know
if you need anything.

28:49.604 --> 28:50.438
Okay.

28:50.480 --> 28:51.731
How was it on sundeck with him?

28:51.773 --> 28:53.858
-All good?
-He’s a funny guy. I like him.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.318
Okay, good.

28:55.360 --> 28:58.863
Okay, for starter, homemade
wild boar raviolo.

28:58.905 --> 29:00.281
Yes, I’m the first.

29:00.323 --> 29:02.659
The main course,
pan-fried yellowtail.

29:02.701 --> 29:03.702
Cool, thank you.

29:03.743 --> 29:05.078
Beautiful.
Thank you.

29:05.120 --> 29:08.415
Okay, I’m just going to
print this menu quickly.

29:08.456 --> 29:11.209
Yeah, they are difficult,
but I’ve had worse.

29:11.251 --> 29:12.877
That’s what I keep trying
to tell myself.

29:12.919 --> 29:15.964
Trust me.
You’ve had way worse.

29:16.006 --> 29:17.757
Tumi is very approachable.

29:17.799 --> 29:19.592
There’s an energy about her

29:19.634 --> 29:21.970
that’s an expectation
of perfection,

29:22.012 --> 29:23.096
which I really like.

29:23.138 --> 29:24.305
She really knows what she wants.

29:24.347 --> 29:26.641
Just make sure
you get some rest.

29:26.683 --> 29:27.934
I will. Thank you.

29:27.976 --> 29:29.060
-Hello.
-What’s this?

29:29.102 --> 29:30.395
Is this for later?

29:30.437 --> 29:32.230
Let me check in with
my husband and Adjua

29:32.272 --> 29:33.398
because she’s our vegan.

29:33.440 --> 29:34.649
I can come up with
you if you want.

29:34.691 --> 29:35.650
That’d be awesome.

29:35.692 --> 29:36.985
How’s it going?

29:37.027 --> 29:38.445
Good, just got all
the steaming finished.

29:38.486 --> 29:39.279
Amazing.

29:39.320 --> 29:40.739
What’s going on up there?

29:40.780 --> 29:42.490
After you’ve done this,
you can go on a break.

29:42.532 --> 29:43.908
Happy days.

29:43.950 --> 29:45.785
Thank you so much.

29:45.827 --> 29:48.246
No worries.

29:49.789 --> 29:50.749
No.

29:50.790 --> 29:52.167
We can change it to lobster.

29:52.208 --> 29:54.294
I would like penne
pasta with that same sauce

29:54.336 --> 29:55.587
so you don’t have to
switch it up too much.

29:55.628 --> 29:57.797
So we keep what
we’re planning here.

29:57.839 --> 29:59.257
Change the pasta.

29:59.299 --> 30:01.259
Add the lobster to my pasta
with that sauce.

30:01.301 --> 30:02.677
I’m going to go change quick.

30:02.719 --> 30:03.803
Yeah.

30:03.845 --> 30:04.971
You’ll just help Kyle.

30:05.013 --> 30:06.306
The boar.

30:06.348 --> 30:08.099
We’re going to change
out for lobster.

30:08.141 --> 30:09.601
Lobster raviolo?

30:09.642 --> 30:11.102
We’re going to change
the raviolo

30:11.144 --> 30:12.812
to another type of pasta.

30:12.854 --> 30:14.773
I could do a lobster linguine.

30:14.814 --> 30:16.149
A lobster bisque sauce.

30:16.191 --> 30:17.859
-That’ll be nice.
-Yeah.

30:17.901 --> 30:19.194
Good morning.

30:19.235 --> 30:20.487
You were knocked out
for like 15 minutes.

30:20.528 --> 30:22.655
He’s been done for a while.

30:22.697 --> 30:26.284
Look, if you can,
just refuel that tender.

30:26.326 --> 30:27.827
You haven’t seen my
boyfriend yet, have you?

30:27.869 --> 30:30.663
-What is he?
-Italian.

30:30.705 --> 30:31.664
He is, but he’s...

30:31.706 --> 30:32.707
American Italian.

30:32.749 --> 30:34.125
I like that.

30:34.167 --> 30:35.794
After leaving Motoryacht Home,

30:35.835 --> 30:39.297
I had a one-way ticket to
New York City to meet Frank.

30:39.339 --> 30:41.549
Frank was a charter guest
on Motoryacht Home.

30:41.591 --> 30:44.427
And I realized
there was no connection.

30:44.469 --> 30:46.971
So after that, I went
on a dating app

30:47.013 --> 30:49.307
and I saw this profile pop up.

30:49.349 --> 30:52.602
Dr. Zachary Keith Riley.

30:52.644 --> 30:54.896
We’ve been dating ever since.

30:54.938 --> 30:56.398
I’m super, super in love,

30:56.439 --> 30:57.982
and we’re going to go
to South Africa

30:58.024 --> 31:00.485
because I’d like to get engaged
there with my family.

31:00.527 --> 31:02.570
I’m really, really excited.

31:04.197 --> 31:06.032
I would let that man do
dirty things to me.

31:06.074 --> 31:07.617
It’s good to work with girls.

31:07.659 --> 31:09.869
Why, because we’re hilarious
and really hard workers?

31:09.911 --> 31:11.204
Yeah.

31:11.246 --> 31:12.997
We’re changing the
wild boar ravioli

31:13.039 --> 31:15.000
to lobster spice linguine.

31:15.041 --> 31:16.334
Okay.

31:16.376 --> 31:18.086
That’s the only change
to the menu.

31:19.295 --> 31:21.256
How are you?
I miss you.

31:21.297 --> 31:22.716
I’m telling you,
everything had a flow.

31:22.757 --> 31:24.884
Now that Tumi’s in charge
it’s [bleep] me.

31:24.926 --> 31:26.720
And then, apparently,
she’s already said something

31:26.761 --> 31:28.888
about you to Kyle.

31:28.930 --> 31:30.849
The chef is the best thing
about this ----ing boat.

31:30.890 --> 31:32.767
-Really?
-Yeah.

31:32.809 --> 31:34.394
This is bullsh--.

31:34.436 --> 31:36.563
Don’t start being all friendly
and nice and fake,

31:36.604 --> 31:37.897
but making my life
----ing hard.

31:37.939 --> 31:39.107
Pisses me off.

31:39.149 --> 31:40.233
She messaged
Kyle last night saying

31:40.275 --> 31:43.111
she has no problem firing me.

31:43.153 --> 31:44.779
-Said that to Kyle?
-Good luck.

31:47.949 --> 31:50.785
Cheffy, I can help you with
anything as well that you need.

31:50.827 --> 31:52.120
Yeah.

31:57.500 --> 31:59.336
All right, give me
that funnel, please.

31:59.377 --> 32:00.587
Bump that sh-- back.

32:00.628 --> 32:01.838
Yeah, you should be a
good at that.

32:01.880 --> 32:03.131
I’m coming.
He’s coming.

32:03.173 --> 32:04.674
It’s coming.

32:08.386 --> 32:09.512
Like fans and
stuff tied to the roof?

32:09.554 --> 32:12.349
It’s easy.
Leave that with me.

32:16.394 --> 32:18.521
Okay, you want to
go the big way.

32:18.563 --> 32:20.899
-The big daddy way.
-Just dump it.

32:20.940 --> 32:22.400
You accept me how I am.

32:22.442 --> 32:24.194
Welcome in my La La Land.

32:24.235 --> 32:25.236
How are you, anyway?

32:25.278 --> 32:26.237
-I’m good.
-Yeah?

32:26.279 --> 32:27.739
Yeah.

32:27.781 --> 32:29.366
It’s lovely to see
a Black woman in yachting.

32:29.407 --> 32:30.700
I’m not lying to you.

32:30.742 --> 32:32.577
Sometimes I’m just like,
I’m bloody done.

32:32.619 --> 32:34.788
Like, what do I have to prove?

32:34.829 --> 32:36.956
It’s like I’m not here
changing the world.

32:36.998 --> 32:38.083
You’re changing my world.

32:38.124 --> 32:39.167
Oh, I love that.

32:39.209 --> 32:40.460
You change...

32:40.502 --> 32:42.587
Every single person
who comes on here

32:42.629 --> 32:45.173
is seeing a fellow
Black woman do this.

32:45.215 --> 32:47.759
-This is a big deal, right?
-Yeah.

32:47.801 --> 32:50.011
There is a massive lack
of diversity in yachting,

32:50.053 --> 32:51.763
and the reason why
it doesn’t get spoken about

32:51.805 --> 32:53.890
is because they keep
defending it.

32:53.932 --> 32:57.519
And it’s like, yeah, but I
worked with a Black deckhand.

32:57.560 --> 33:00.563
Okay, but have you worked
with a Black first officer?

33:00.605 --> 33:02.065
Okay, have you worked with
a Black captain?

33:02.107 --> 33:03.983
Yes, there are people of color
in the industry,

33:04.025 --> 33:05.485
but they’ve put
in certain positions

33:05.527 --> 33:06.903
where they’re not seen.

33:06.945 --> 33:08.530
I know a lot of people
that don’t want to come

33:08.571 --> 33:10.031
into the industry
because they feel like

33:10.073 --> 33:11.408
they would never be
given the opportunities.

33:11.449 --> 33:15.203
So here I am like...
Bitch.

33:15.245 --> 33:18.206
If you fight hard,
you can do it.

33:18.248 --> 33:20.583
-Sister!
-Hey!

33:20.625 --> 33:21.751
Do you want to put
your blacks on?

33:21.793 --> 33:23.086
Sure.

33:23.128 --> 33:25.005
-It’s 7:30. Let’s go.
-Time to get dressed.

33:29.342 --> 33:30.635
Oh, [bleep].

33:34.472 --> 33:35.932
That’s it.

33:35.974 --> 33:37.434
-It smells so good.
-Are you ready?

33:37.475 --> 33:38.435
Yeah, I think I’m ready.

33:38.476 --> 33:40.395
Where’s everyone?

33:40.437 --> 33:41.938
-The decor.
-It’s beautiful.

33:41.980 --> 33:42.939
So pretty.

33:42.981 --> 33:44.899
Oh, this is beautiful.

33:44.941 --> 33:46.651
Tell the chef to radio me
when he’s ready.

33:46.693 --> 33:47.569
Sure.

33:47.610 --> 33:49.446
The pajama party.

33:49.487 --> 33:50.530
I hate all this gold, so
I’m going to make it

33:50.572 --> 33:51.531
all white and fluffy.

33:51.573 --> 33:53.783
Starter is lobster linguini.

33:53.825 --> 33:54.826
Delicious.

33:54.868 --> 33:56.036
Do you want to stick
these together?

33:56.077 --> 33:57.245
Have a seat. Relax.

33:57.287 --> 33:58.747
I really hope we
leave the dock tomorrow.

33:58.788 --> 34:00.415
Well, like, you
can stay with me,

34:00.457 --> 34:01.958
because I’ve always got
a job for you.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.043
I know.

34:03.084 --> 34:04.336
Meow.

34:04.377 --> 34:05.962
I recently got out
of a long relationship,

34:06.004 --> 34:07.630
but I’m just keen
to have some fun.

34:07.672 --> 34:09.424
But I’ve been given
this amazing position

34:09.466 --> 34:10.967
as the head of department.

34:11.009 --> 34:13.261
I know I can’t get too
distracted by these girls.

34:13.303 --> 34:15.263
So, have you got a girlfriend?
What’s the girl?

34:15.305 --> 34:16.639
I’m too young for that.

34:16.681 --> 34:18.516
-How old are you?
-25.

34:18.558 --> 34:20.143
Once I was dating someone
and I broke up with them

34:20.185 --> 34:21.811
and was seeing another
person on the boat,

34:21.853 --> 34:23.146
we were in the
crew mess one time

34:23.188 --> 34:24.981
and they were throwing
food at each other.

34:25.023 --> 34:27.192
Captain gets a little bit of
cream cheese stuck on his face

34:27.233 --> 34:29.944
and I’m like, sorry, dude.

34:29.986 --> 34:32.489
So, yeah, that kind of affected
the work environment.

34:32.530 --> 34:33.948
What are your thoughts?

34:33.990 --> 34:35.492
I already know my thoughts
on a lot of things,

34:35.533 --> 34:36.785
but I don’t
need to repeat that, do I?

34:36.826 --> 34:38.244
[laughing]

34:38.286 --> 34:39.454
It’s so good.

34:39.496 --> 34:41.873
So, for starters,
we’ve got

34:41.915 --> 34:43.875
the homemade lobster
spice linguine.

34:43.917 --> 34:45.168
This is good.

34:45.210 --> 34:46.336
Sorry, honey.
Pardon my reach.

34:46.378 --> 34:47.796
That’s okay.

34:47.837 --> 34:49.005
-I’ll move that, absolutely.
-Thank you.

34:49.047 --> 34:50.840
Thank you.

34:50.882 --> 34:52.759
-You got to smell it.
-Oh, it’s so good.

34:52.801 --> 34:54.010
You two just want
to knock off?

34:54.052 --> 34:55.011
Yeah, knock off, huh?

34:55.053 --> 34:56.012
What number are we giving?

34:56.054 --> 34:57.180
-Is that a...
-A 10.

34:57.222 --> 34:59.683
A 10? Wow. Okay.

34:59.724 --> 35:01.726
All right, we are done.

35:01.768 --> 35:03.353
I’m kind of ready for the
next course now, though.

35:03.395 --> 35:04.646
Yeah.

35:04.688 --> 35:06.147
They love the seafood,
don’t they?

35:06.189 --> 35:07.357
Seafood is the key.

35:07.399 --> 35:08.858
This fish is yellowtail.

35:08.900 --> 35:09.943
Nice.

35:09.984 --> 35:12.487
Kyle, Kyle.
Kyle, let’s get plates.

35:12.529 --> 35:13.947
I’m on my way down.

35:13.988 --> 35:17.033
-How are you going, my love?
-Hey, baby.

35:17.075 --> 35:19.661
Natalya, Natalya.
Good night. Thank you.

35:19.703 --> 35:21.371
And go bugger yourself.

35:21.413 --> 35:23.540
I’m just so glad that
I’m not up there in service.

35:23.581 --> 35:26.292
Ooh, what we got here Tumi?

35:26.334 --> 35:31.756
So, we have yellowtail steamed
mussels with citrus mid-sauce.

35:31.798 --> 35:34.175
-Oh, this is our main.
-This is not my main.

35:34.217 --> 35:35.385
Well, what did you got, honey?

35:35.427 --> 35:36.678
-She wanted lobster.
-Yeah, remember?

35:36.720 --> 35:37.971
-You ordered lobster?
-Oh, is this...

35:38.013 --> 35:38.972
No, this is lobster.

35:39.014 --> 35:42.142
No, you got lobster...
The pasta.

35:42.183 --> 35:43.143
She wanted lobster for her main.

35:43.184 --> 35:44.436
Gotcha.

35:44.477 --> 35:45.895
I wanted the lobster
pieces with the...

35:45.937 --> 35:47.397
-The lobster.
-It’s okay. It’s okay.

35:47.439 --> 35:48.398
I can wait.
I’m not like starving.

35:48.440 --> 35:49.482
It’s okay.

35:49.524 --> 35:51.901
So, I’m confused.

35:51.943 --> 35:54.404
She wants the spaghetti
lobster thing.

35:54.446 --> 35:55.822
What do you mean?

35:55.864 --> 35:57.657
That’s what she said
she wants for her main.

35:57.699 --> 35:59.534
She didn’t say it to me
but I’ll make one now.

35:59.576 --> 36:02.203
Wait one minute.
The spaghetti will be ready.

36:02.245 --> 36:03.246
No worries. No worries.

36:03.288 --> 36:04.497
-Hello.
-You finished?

36:04.539 --> 36:06.082
The easiest tip money
of my life.

36:06.124 --> 36:07.292
I don’t understand
what’s happening.

36:07.334 --> 36:08.918
What’s happening?

36:08.960 --> 36:10.712
Like, what did she order?
What didn’t she order?

36:10.754 --> 36:12.464
So, we keep what
we’re planning here.

36:12.505 --> 36:13.798
-Mm-hmm.
-Change the pasta.

36:13.840 --> 36:15.967
Add the lobster to my pasta
with that sauce.

36:16.009 --> 36:20.013
Yes.

36:20.055 --> 36:22.474
So, we got a side order
of roasted carrots.

36:22.515 --> 36:23.975
If anyone likes this.

36:24.017 --> 36:25.185
-Yeah.
-Roasted carrots.

36:25.226 --> 36:26.478
Can I just go around?

36:26.519 --> 36:27.604
Bobbi is like,
where’s my lobster?

36:27.645 --> 36:29.230
Look at your face.
Your face.

36:29.272 --> 36:31.107
She enjoys the yellowtail,
but she would like lobster.

36:31.149 --> 36:32.984
So, do you want the
lobster that you have

36:33.026 --> 36:34.903
for the first, the pasta
that she just had?

36:34.944 --> 36:36.780
I need it for my meal.
I don’t want this.

36:36.821 --> 36:39.407
Oh, so they gave it to you
as a first course.

36:39.449 --> 36:41.993
Oh, okay.

36:42.035 --> 36:43.286
Okay.

36:43.328 --> 36:45.121
So, this is a sh---show.

36:45.163 --> 36:47.457
They’re drunk. One.

36:47.499 --> 36:49.626
Two, when she heard the menu.

36:49.668 --> 36:52.045
Who said it to her?

36:52.087 --> 36:53.588
Right. Well, we need to be on
top of this

36:53.630 --> 36:54.923
because I could have
thrown sh-- at them.

36:54.964 --> 36:56.383
You need to be on top
of what they want.

36:56.424 --> 36:58.093
I am on top. What the hell
are you talking about?

36:58.134 --> 36:59.260
-I’m not on top.
-No, you’re obviously not.

37:00.845 --> 37:02.222
Let’s get this over,
we’ll talk at the end.

37:02.263 --> 37:03.973
Don’t do that.
When you get stressed out,

37:04.015 --> 37:05.183
-I’m here to help you.
-I’m not stressed.

37:05.225 --> 37:06.601
Believe me,
I’m not stressed.

37:06.643 --> 37:07.852
You’ll know when I’m stressed.

37:07.894 --> 37:08.978
If anything goes wrong
with the boat,

37:09.020 --> 37:10.480
it’s on Captain Sandy.

37:10.522 --> 37:12.691
If anything goes wrong
with the food, it’s on me.

37:17.112 --> 37:18.363
----ing hell.

37:18.405 --> 37:19.823
----ing hell to you, too.

37:19.864 --> 37:20.657
[bleep]

37:20.699 --> 37:22.033
Here we go.

37:22.075 --> 37:23.118
Oh, thank you.

37:23.159 --> 37:25.620
I thought you were
going to bed.

37:25.662 --> 37:28.081
Who goes to bed this early?

37:28.123 --> 37:29.958
So, I just want to show you.
This is what they wrote.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.128
When they changed,
lobster spice linguine.

37:33.169 --> 37:35.463
So, she assumed that this was
going to be her main dish.

37:35.505 --> 37:37.007
So, when she got the starter,

37:37.048 --> 37:39.426
she knew that
this was the starter.

37:39.467 --> 37:40.802
So, when she got the starter,

37:40.844 --> 37:43.096
she supposed she was
getting it again?

37:43.138 --> 37:44.889
That doesn’t sound
right, though.

37:44.931 --> 37:47.600
This is where it comes from.

37:47.642 --> 37:49.144
I’m not making up stuff.

37:49.185 --> 37:51.438
Yeah, I get that,
but it still doesn’t make sense.

37:51.479 --> 37:52.522
Drama.

37:52.564 --> 37:53.690
He’s not happy.

37:53.732 --> 37:55.025
That’s ----ing... Hey.

37:55.066 --> 37:56.443
She didn’t realize it
was the starter.

37:56.484 --> 37:58.903
Right. She got confused.
It’s not our problem.

37:58.945 --> 38:00.196
She’s the one that got confused.

38:00.238 --> 38:02.073
Understand?

38:03.533 --> 38:05.452
Hmm. Yeah.

38:05.493 --> 38:07.871
You know what’s pissing me
off more than anything?

38:07.912 --> 38:09.998
The fact that it’s
always the guest’s fault.

38:10.040 --> 38:12.125
----ing have some
accountability.

38:12.167 --> 38:13.126
Blaming the guest?

38:13.168 --> 38:14.544
Talk sh-- about me
behind my back?

38:14.586 --> 38:15.879
I’ll tell you what.

38:15.920 --> 38:18.006
First impression of Tumi
is really ----ing bad.

38:18.048 --> 38:19.591
Hi, my love.
Do you need anything?

38:19.632 --> 38:20.759
Yes, therapy.

38:20.800 --> 38:22.177
-That makes three of us.
-A shrink.

38:22.218 --> 38:23.386
I heard you, like,
getting angry,

38:23.428 --> 38:24.929
so I wanted to come save you.

38:24.971 --> 38:26.348
He doesn’t respect me.
That’s the problem.

38:26.389 --> 38:29.100
Mm-hmm.

38:29.142 --> 38:31.227
Oh, my God, these
stairs are dangerous.

38:31.269 --> 38:33.730
If I put down chicken and
they change their mind to...

38:33.772 --> 38:35.065
what must I do?

38:35.106 --> 38:37.025
What ----ing yacht
have you worked on?

38:37.067 --> 38:38.234
-Literally.
-A big one, clearly,

38:38.276 --> 38:40.070
because people change
their mind.

38:40.111 --> 38:41.154
Coming up...

38:41.196 --> 38:42.947
I am fine with it,
end of the story.

38:42.989 --> 38:44.532
Stop doing this with your hands.

38:44.574 --> 38:46.034
Stop talking back to me.

38:46.076 --> 38:48.453
Honey, you stepped
on board with this attitude.

38:48.495 --> 38:49.579
There was no appreciation.

38:49.621 --> 38:51.081
Bye, Natalya.

38:51.122 --> 38:54.084
See, come handle it.
Don’t go talk to Kyle about it.

38:58.254 --> 38:59.172
Okay, I’m gonna go
speak to him.

39:00.715 --> 39:03.677
Just, uh, radio me
if you need backup.

39:03.718 --> 39:04.803
Think that there would be.

39:04.844 --> 39:06.805
I’ll keep talking.

39:06.846 --> 39:08.682
Quick chat.
I want you to win.

39:08.723 --> 39:10.809
I never, ever want you to fail.

39:10.850 --> 39:11.976
You’re phenomenal.

39:12.018 --> 39:14.896
And I will always
be super honest.

39:14.938 --> 39:16.523
Nowhere do I want
to see you fail.

39:16.564 --> 39:18.024
We’re good. We’re good.
Don’t worry. We’re good.

39:18.066 --> 39:19.234
But I know you have
someone in your ear.

39:19.275 --> 39:20.902
I would like at
least a fair chance.

39:20.944 --> 39:22.404
-Please listen to me.
-I’m proving myself.

39:22.445 --> 39:24.197
Please listen to me.
I make my own mind up anyway.

39:24.239 --> 39:26.866
-Don’t worry about that.
-Just making sure.

39:26.908 --> 39:28.076
You guys, I’m gonna
put on my PJs.

39:28.118 --> 39:29.494
-Yeah, me too.
-Five minutes.

39:29.536 --> 39:31.204
-We’ll meet back?
-You gotta go change.

39:31.246 --> 39:32.872
You need to go now.
Because I need to take a dump.

39:32.914 --> 39:34.874
[laughing]

39:37.544 --> 39:40.213
-Girl, go to bed.
-Okay.

39:40.255 --> 39:41.464
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

39:41.506 --> 39:42.716
Of course.

39:42.757 --> 39:44.092
You excited to party
with a guest?

39:44.134 --> 39:45.677
That’s the last thing
I want right now.

39:45.719 --> 39:47.429
Look at this.

39:47.470 --> 39:49.472
Ooh.

39:49.514 --> 39:50.849
Look at this, how cute!

39:50.890 --> 39:53.059
They did a great job.

39:53.101 --> 39:55.729
-What did they ask for?
-Vegan flatbread pizzas.

39:55.770 --> 39:58.690
These little things.

39:58.732 --> 39:59.774
Yeah.

39:59.816 --> 40:00.859
You got it.

40:00.900 --> 40:02.235
Good night, babes.

40:02.277 --> 40:03.570
I’ll text you what
time I’m done.

40:03.611 --> 40:05.071
I just want to knock off.

40:05.113 --> 40:06.322
I don’t think they’re
gonna be up that late.

40:06.364 --> 40:07.866
Thank you.

40:07.907 --> 40:09.409
-What’s happening tonight?
-We’re gonna have some fun.

40:09.451 --> 40:11.244
-Hi, Kyle.
-Kyle.

40:11.286 --> 40:13.788
Can I have a double Tito’s soda
light ice and a cup of limes.

40:13.830 --> 40:15.373
-Same.
-Same.

40:24.341 --> 40:25.925
Here we are, sir.

40:25.967 --> 40:28.303
We’ll do snacks by the hot tub.

40:28.345 --> 40:30.263
Yeah, make yourself comfortable.
I’ll fill you up.

40:30.305 --> 40:34.267
Oh, my gosh, Kyle.
What would we do without Kyle?

40:34.309 --> 40:35.226
You’re welcome.

40:38.021 --> 40:39.731
You guys, there’s snacks for us.

40:39.773 --> 40:42.484
-So let’s enjoy.
-We serve.

40:42.525 --> 40:44.069
Give Kyle a hat and a chain.

40:44.110 --> 40:45.362
You know what? I’ve actually
never worn one of these.

40:45.403 --> 40:47.072
Oh, that’s real gold, honey.

40:47.113 --> 40:48.406
You feel how heavy it is?

40:48.448 --> 40:51.534
He’s like, me and
my Black friends.

40:51.576 --> 40:52.911
It’s last call for alcohol.

40:52.952 --> 40:54.120
Anybody want anything?

40:54.162 --> 40:55.914
Cheers, guys.
Love you guys.

40:55.955 --> 40:59.417
-No more wine for tonight.
-Goodnight!

40:59.459 --> 41:02.420
We’re going to sleep.
That’s it.

41:02.462 --> 41:06.007
Oh, these orange juice.
I love orange juice.

41:08.426 --> 41:09.386
Night, Bobbi-tine.

41:09.427 --> 41:11.262
Night, Mecca-tine.

41:21.981 --> 41:23.191
[phone vibrates]

41:27.195 --> 41:29.572
Babe, I just like...
I just can’t deal.

41:29.614 --> 41:32.158
Haleigh, can you help
clean up the main salon?

41:32.200 --> 41:35.286
The morning person should
wake up to a packed-away boat

41:35.328 --> 41:36.996
where she should just give
it a quick wipe down

41:37.038 --> 41:38.373
and just start for breakfast.

41:38.415 --> 41:40.959
Not ----ing cleaning
up decorations

41:41.001 --> 41:42.002
from the night before.

41:42.043 --> 41:43.336
Not professional.

41:43.378 --> 41:44.587
[growls]

41:44.629 --> 41:47.549
They need main knives.
They need main forks.

41:47.590 --> 41:48.633
Good morning.

41:48.675 --> 41:49.634
-Hey.
-How’s it going?

41:49.676 --> 41:50.635
Good.

41:50.677 --> 41:51.803
How are we looking?

41:51.845 --> 41:53.013
-We can leave the dock.
-Perfect.

41:53.054 --> 41:55.849
Good morning.

41:55.890 --> 41:57.058
What’s our breakfast special?

41:57.100 --> 41:59.019
Smoked haddock, spinach.

41:59.060 --> 42:01.813
Poached egg,
torched hollandaise sauce.

42:01.855 --> 42:03.481
-Tumi.
-Hi.

42:05.567 --> 42:06.735
In the salon
now, there’s like heaps

42:06.776 --> 42:08.153
full of dishes this morning.

42:08.194 --> 42:09.362
I understand, but sometimes,
if it’s like

42:09.404 --> 42:10.905
he’s going
to bed at three,

42:10.947 --> 42:13.116
I would rather him go to
bed as soon as possible

42:13.158 --> 42:14.492
than him being up later.

42:14.534 --> 42:15.994
Like, it’s just like things
like this,

42:16.036 --> 42:17.245
he’s like all left out

42:17.287 --> 42:18.913
and just becomes a
bit of a cluster.

42:18.955 --> 42:21.166
I think we’re pretty comfortable
for Kyle to be able to...

42:21.207 --> 42:22.292
We’re ahead, I feel,
like if Kyle

42:22.334 --> 42:23.626
has all the dishwashers empty.

42:23.668 --> 42:24.878
No, I need Kyle
to be bed into bed by three.

42:24.919 --> 42:26.421
Why?

42:26.463 --> 42:28.423
Natalya, I’m telling you that
I am okay with it.

42:28.465 --> 42:30.216
If it means that someone’s
going to bed at three...

42:30.258 --> 42:32.344
-Oh, my God.
-I’m telling you I’m fine.

42:32.385 --> 42:34.846
I’m fine.
I’m not... Why are you...

42:34.888 --> 42:37.849
I am telling you
I am fine with it.

42:37.891 --> 42:39.017
End of the story.

42:39.059 --> 42:40.560
Stop doing things
with your hands.

42:40.602 --> 42:42.270
Stop talking back to me.

42:42.312 --> 42:44.147
Look, I’m a first-time
chief stew,

42:44.189 --> 42:45.565
but I know what I’m doing.

42:45.607 --> 42:47.233
She has no respect.

42:47.275 --> 42:49.444
She reminds me of a Chihuahua.

42:49.486 --> 42:52.405
Territorial, combative,
speaks all the time.

42:52.447 --> 42:54.240
And I’ve just had it.
We’re done.

42:54.282 --> 42:56.117
You have been attacking me
since day one.

42:56.159 --> 42:59.287
Um, excuse me?

42:59.329 --> 43:01.039
You have a problem
with the fact--

43:01.081 --> 43:02.082
You stepped on board with
the worst attitude...

43:02.123 --> 43:03.708
We will speak...

43:03.750 --> 43:05.001
You stepped on board with
the worst attitude.

43:05.043 --> 43:06.252
There was no appreciation.

43:06.294 --> 43:08.046
-Bye, Natalya.
-See, come handle it.

43:08.088 --> 43:09.673
Don’t go talk to Kyle about it.

43:09.714 --> 43:12.425
Talk to me about it if
you’re confrontational.

43:12.467 --> 43:13.468
Christ.

43:16.429 --> 43:18.306
Next time on
"Below Deck Mediterranean"...

43:18.348 --> 43:20.892
-Is it up here?
-Oh, hell no.

43:20.934 --> 43:22.435
What the...

43:22.477 --> 43:25.105
We don’t have time to
----ing sit around and wank.

43:25.146 --> 43:28.983
Come across a lot of
lazy people in yachting.

43:29.025 --> 43:30.068
Come, we’re not lazy
on this boat.

43:30.110 --> 43:32.112
No, we’re not lazy.

43:32.153 --> 43:33.488
It’s ----ing work.

43:33.530 --> 43:34.698
The way how she’s gone
about everything

43:34.739 --> 43:36.491
is just ----ing stupid.

43:38.368 --> 43:39.411
She is.

43:40.870 --> 43:42.914
Okay, we’re all good and
nicely secure on the stern.

43:42.956 --> 43:44.624
How you doing up forward,
Haleigh?

43:44.666 --> 43:45.750
One way house, because--

43:45.792 --> 43:47.419
Can you shut up a little bit?

43:48.336 --> 43:49.921
What’s the issue this time?

43:49.963 --> 43:51.673
You said I’ve done the cabins.
When you say that--

43:51.715 --> 43:52.966
They’re freshened up for the
middle of the day, huns.

43:53.008 --> 43:54.134
Let me finish.

43:54.175 --> 43:55.927
Stop putting your
hand in my face.

43:55.969 --> 43:57.470
You’re going to do this, then
I’m going to do this to you.

43:57.512 --> 44:00.473
Tumi, Natalya,
to the bridge now.

44:00.515 --> 44:02.600
To the bridge.

44:02.642 --> 44:04.644
You haven’t given
her a fair chance.

44:04.686 --> 44:06.563
I can’t tolerate this.

44:06.604 --> 44:08.440
-You’re in a leadership role.
-I agree, Sandy.

44:08.481 --> 44:09.816
You need to rise above
because right now

44:09.858 --> 44:11.609
I’m ready to put you
both off the boat.
