[Supergirl]
Previously on Supergirl...

00:03.171 --> 00:04.305
Forgive me for saying,
but you seem
to be courting emptiness.

00:04.338 --> 00:08.176
Past couple of months
when I dream,
I see Mon-El.

00:08.209 --> 00:10.511
I can't help people
if I'm broken.

00:10.544 --> 00:11.812
Maggie doesn't want to
have kids.

00:11.845 --> 00:15.283
[crying] I want to be a mom.
What am I gonna do?

00:15.316 --> 00:16.384
You have to say it.

00:16.417 --> 00:17.651
We can't be together.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.253
You're gonna have to
get by at the DEO

00:19.287 --> 00:20.721
without Alex and I
for a couple of days.

00:20.754 --> 00:23.457
-Where are we going?
-We're going home.

00:24.458 --> 00:27.027
["Night So Long" playing]

00:36.704 --> 00:41.342
* I say goodbye to love again

00:43.244 --> 00:46.747
* In loneliness
My only friend *

00:46.780 --> 00:48.282
Welcome home.

00:49.583 --> 00:54.155
* In loneliness my only fear

00:55.456 --> 01:00.361
* The night's here *

01:02.196 --> 01:06.467
* And I say goodbye
To love once more *

01:08.469 --> 01:11.205
* No shadow darkening my door

01:12.206 --> 01:13.341
Hey, honey.

01:14.742 --> 01:19.147
* Until your memory is gone

01:20.548 --> 01:27.488
* The night so long

01:40.934 --> 01:44.905
[Eliza] You still out here?
[Kara] Yeah.

01:44.938 --> 01:48.776
I made coffee in case
this turns into
a teary all-nighter.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.711
You don't have to stay up.

01:50.744 --> 01:55.249
Well, this is the
mom fine print.

01:55.283 --> 01:59.320
When your child's in agony,
you show up
regardless the hour.

01:59.353 --> 02:02.523
I figured it would be nice
to get her away from everything

02:02.556 --> 02:03.724
for a couple of days.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.593
This is going to be hard
no matter what.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.229
But at least here she can

02:09.463 --> 02:11.899
lean into it.

02:11.932 --> 02:14.435
Better than letting her
pretend she's fine.

02:18.206 --> 02:20.641
You're worried about me?

02:20.674 --> 02:23.777
I think I worry about you
more than Alex.

02:23.811 --> 02:26.747
Losing Maggie
is going to be excruciating,

02:26.780 --> 02:29.483
but at least Alex
doesn't close herself off.

02:29.517 --> 02:30.851
I'm not doing that.

02:30.884 --> 02:34.522
You have the most wide
open heart in the world
for other people.

02:34.555 --> 02:37.958
But when you feel weak,
you punish yourself for it.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.660
You've had an awful year--

02:39.693 --> 02:43.231
And I'm feeling a lot better.
I promise.

02:43.264 --> 02:45.799
You don't have to be better.
You're allowed to be a mess.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.701
Too many people depend on me.

02:47.735 --> 02:48.836
That is a great excuse.

02:48.869 --> 02:53.307
I'm just accepting the fact
that I'm not human.

02:55.576 --> 02:58.579
And if I'm going to do
the things I have to do,

02:58.612 --> 03:02.816
I have to walk away
from certain

03:04.652 --> 03:06.186
vulnerabilities.

03:09.323 --> 03:11.425
You've thought a lot
about this.

03:11.459 --> 03:14.262
Yeah, it's been
a long time coming.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.598
I'm happy about it.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.602
You don't seem happy.

03:33.881 --> 03:37.485
Brought you this.
You could make it Irish.

03:40.388 --> 03:42.222
What's the point of all this?

03:42.790 --> 03:44.325
[sighs]

03:44.358 --> 03:48.896
We need to sleep.
We always slept well here.

03:48.929 --> 03:52.500
So, we'll stay for,
like, three days,

03:52.533 --> 03:56.737
and Mom will cook tons
of food, and I'll gain,
like, five pounds,

03:56.770 --> 03:59.373
and then walk back
into an empty apartment.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.610
Do you want to talk about it?

04:04.378 --> 04:05.546
It might help.

04:07.348 --> 04:08.982
You don't get to do that.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.353
-What?
-You don't get to shut down,

04:12.386 --> 04:14.488
what, for six months
after Mon-El goes,

04:14.522 --> 04:17.024
and then now sit here
and you tell me to talk.

04:17.057 --> 04:19.259
-It will get better.
-Yeah?

04:22.863 --> 04:24.398
Are you better?

04:25.333 --> 04:26.634
Okay.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.837
You are edging on
mean drunk, and I only
signed up for sad drunk.

04:29.870 --> 04:34.608
Oh, that's right. I forgot.
It's whatever Kara
says that goes.

04:34.642 --> 04:37.711
Right? I mean,
screw everybody else.
Kara knows best.

04:37.745 --> 04:39.012
You know what? I'm sorry

04:39.046 --> 04:40.581
that I was trying to do
something nice for you.

04:40.614 --> 04:44.785
No, I'm sorry I broke the
imaginary rules for a weekend
I didn't ask for.

04:44.818 --> 04:45.986
I'm not gonna
try to help you anymore.

04:46.019 --> 04:47.688
-Good.
-Great.

05:03.504 --> 05:07.975
[Eliza] Girls! You need to
wake up. I am not kidding.
Last call.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.360
Open the freaking door!

05:26.394 --> 05:28.629
Girls! For the love of God!

05:28.662 --> 05:31.532
Why did you ever adopt her?
I'll never get over this!

05:31.565 --> 05:33.801
-[Young Kara]
You're such a whiner!
-I hate you!

05:33.834 --> 05:35.503
I hate you, too!

05:37.671 --> 05:38.772
Argh!

05:49.617 --> 05:51.885
-Where's your sister?
-I don't have a sister.

05:56.757 --> 05:59.493
Did you not finish
your calculus last night?

05:59.527 --> 06:01.662
No, I'm just double checking
my work.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.364
-Good morning, sweetheart.
-Morning, Eliza.

06:06.534 --> 06:08.936
It's kind of ironic
they call it
"Advanced Placement."

06:08.969 --> 06:11.805
On Krypton,
we did calculus from age four.

06:11.839 --> 06:14.742
Sorry we can't all be
as sophisticated
as Kryptonians.

06:14.775 --> 06:15.676
Alex.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.078
Math and science still fun?

06:18.111 --> 06:20.914
I don't know about fun.
They're easy.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.282
How about history?

06:22.315 --> 06:25.586
[sighs] I don't understand
why I have to endure
these classes.

06:25.619 --> 06:29.823
It's not like I need to know
who did what in 1743 to be a--

06:29.857 --> 06:30.924
-A superhero?
-Shut up.

06:30.958 --> 06:34.161
You need to go to school.
Be with kids your own age.

06:34.194 --> 06:36.797
It's giving you a chance
at a normal childhood.

06:36.830 --> 06:40.033
Normal for humans.
I'm literally bulletproof.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.169
And you literally
need to be educated.

06:42.202 --> 06:44.638
By the way, I'm working late
at the lab tonight.

06:44.672 --> 06:45.973
Alex, I need you to babysit.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.908
-She doesn't need a babysitter!
-I don't need a babysitter!

06:47.941 --> 06:51.111
I don't want to hear it!
Go wait for the bus.

06:51.144 --> 06:54.014
Kara, don't forget
your backpack and glasses.

06:54.047 --> 06:57.551
Alex, I need you to go
easy on her.

06:57.585 --> 06:59.720
Sure. Let's make sure
her life is easy.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.692
[school bell ringing]

07:04.725 --> 07:05.993
[upbeat music playing]

07:10.531 --> 07:13.100
[teacher] Miss Danvers?

07:13.133 --> 07:16.069
Earth to Miss Danvers.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.738
[students chuckle]

07:18.572 --> 07:19.540
Sorry, what did you say?

07:19.573 --> 07:22.610
Who was the general
of the Continental Army

07:22.643 --> 07:24.111
during the Revolutionary War?

07:24.678 --> 07:26.013
Washington?

07:27.715 --> 07:29.683
Isaiah Washington?

07:30.718 --> 07:33.053
Creative, I'll give you that.

07:33.086 --> 07:37.758
Josie, I wouldn't say
your GPA justifies that
level of confidence.

07:39.259 --> 07:40.694
Ah.

07:40.728 --> 07:41.929
Miss Danvers, the older.

07:41.962 --> 07:46.166
George Washington
was the leader
of the Continental Army

07:46.199 --> 07:50.971
during the Revolutionary War,
which spanned from
1775 to 1783,

07:51.004 --> 07:53.607
despite the fact
that we claimed independence

07:53.641 --> 07:56.209
from Great Britain in 1776.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.812
Bravo, Miss Danvers. Now...

07:58.846 --> 08:01.048
-[softly] Try and keep up.
-...turn to Page 37.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.751
Go!

08:05.118 --> 08:06.053
[metal clangs]

08:12.159 --> 08:13.794
Try and keep up.

08:16.329 --> 08:19.199
Did you hear that Superman
took down some guy
named Lex Luthor?

08:19.232 --> 08:21.268
Lex Luthor?
He's that bazillionaire, right?

08:21.301 --> 08:23.604
Yeah. Bald. Digs computers.

08:23.637 --> 08:25.272
They're kind of like
arch nemesi.

08:25.305 --> 08:27.741
Yeah. There was this one time
when Lex sold these things

08:27.775 --> 08:30.744
he called Lexosuits,
and Superman was not pleased.

08:30.778 --> 08:31.979
Okay, stalker.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.582
I just think he's cool is all.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.516
Dude wears underwear
over his tights.

08:38.218 --> 08:40.153
Don't you have something
better to do?

08:44.692 --> 08:46.259
Thanks.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.328
You're holding up the line.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.898
[announcer on pa]
Good afternoon,
Midvale High.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.033
Friendly reminder
about the upcoming playoffs,

08:53.066 --> 08:57.004
led by the Midvale's
own star quarterback,
Jake Howell.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.072
[students cheering]

09:02.743 --> 09:03.944
Hey, Alex.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.247
You're friends with him?

09:07.280 --> 09:10.918
What? Uh, no,
he's Kara's friend.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.152
Ugh. Why did your mom
adopt her?

09:12.185 --> 09:14.588
Yeah, what's the return policy
on annoying little brats?

09:14.622 --> 09:16.657
I know, right.

09:16.690 --> 09:17.958
Kenny, over here.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.195
Oh.

09:22.229 --> 09:25.098
Kenny, for someone so smart,
you're so clumsy, man.

09:25.933 --> 09:28.335
-So clumsy.
-Come on, Jake.

09:28.368 --> 09:29.603
Jake, enough.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.173
Thanks, Vicki.

09:33.206 --> 09:35.676
Ken, my man.
In the future, I'd be careful.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.045
Would hate for you to have
some kind of accident,
you know?

09:44.852 --> 09:47.688
I hate football players.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.957
They're a bunch of
chunky sadists.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.659
If they only knew
the dirt I had on them,

09:51.692 --> 09:53.226
they'd be treating me
like royalty.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.294
What do you mean?

09:54.327 --> 09:55.829
It's amazing what people
will say in front of you

09:55.863 --> 09:57.164
when they think
you're invisible.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.832
Invisibility, huh?

09:58.866 --> 10:01.268
Is that your superpower,
Kenny Li?

10:01.301 --> 10:04.872
Yeah, but the asthma
is what gets me the girls.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.110
I wish I could be invisible.

10:10.143 --> 10:14.114
I can't say or do anything
without her blowing up at me.

10:14.147 --> 10:16.950
She'll come around.
She just misses her dad.

10:16.984 --> 10:20.153
I miss people, too.
I'm not lashing
out at the world.

10:20.187 --> 10:22.322
That's because you're
the strongest girl
I've ever met.

10:24.424 --> 10:25.859
What are you doing tonight?

10:26.459 --> 10:27.828
-Absolutely nothing.
-Perfect.

10:27.861 --> 10:31.031
Meet me at the clearing
off of Highberry Road
at ten o'clock.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.033
Okay.

10:39.039 --> 10:42.275
[Kenny] Welcome, Kara Danvers,
to the spectacle of the stars.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.643
Take a look.

10:44.778 --> 10:47.180
-Is that yours?
-My pride and joy.

10:48.448 --> 10:49.649
[Young Kara] It's beautiful.

10:49.683 --> 10:54.922
Oh, and for the tour de force,
I introduce you to Galileo!

10:55.455 --> 10:56.423
[chuckles] What is that?

10:56.456 --> 10:59.426
Without bogging you down
in all the specifics,

10:59.459 --> 11:02.863
what I've constructed here
is a way to take what
this telescope sees

11:02.896 --> 11:05.966
and capture in photographs,
to directly download
to my laptop.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.035
That's so cool.

11:10.938 --> 11:14.207
Somewhere,
past all that darkness,

11:14.241 --> 11:17.144
there are whole other worlds.
Can you imagine?

11:18.311 --> 11:19.179
Yeah.

11:19.212 --> 11:20.981
[Kenny]
What do you think is up there?

11:21.014 --> 11:25.318
I bet it's still just people.
Families and...

11:25.352 --> 11:27.454
They're staring
at the stars above them,

11:27.487 --> 11:30.090
wondering the same thing
about us.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.227
It's a beautiful view.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.363
It is.

11:48.842 --> 11:49.843
[stammers]

11:49.877 --> 11:52.112
I really like your telescope.

11:53.246 --> 11:56.984
Yeah. You'd be surprised
what this thing sees.

12:00.353 --> 12:03.356
You know, you're the
only person in Midvale

12:03.390 --> 12:05.392
who doesn't make me
feel like I'm...

12:07.227 --> 12:09.296
Like I shouldn't be here.

12:10.097 --> 12:11.331
I'm glad you're my friend.

12:12.532 --> 12:13.767
You, too.

12:24.878 --> 12:26.046
[switch clicks]

12:26.079 --> 12:27.147
Where were you?

12:27.180 --> 12:29.182
-None of your business.
-It is, if I'm the one

12:29.216 --> 12:31.819
who would get in trouble
for whatever dumb thing
you were doing.

12:31.852 --> 12:34.087
I am so sick and tired of you
blaming me

12:34.121 --> 12:35.856
for every bad thing
that's happened to you.

12:35.889 --> 12:37.290
Really?

12:37.324 --> 12:40.460
Because my mom wasn't
constantly on my ass
before you came along.

12:40.493 --> 12:43.030
I didn't have to act like
some Earthly ambassador

12:43.063 --> 12:44.898
to the teenage underworld
before you came along,

12:44.932 --> 12:48.869
and I'm pretty sure my dad
wasn't gone
before you came along.

12:48.902 --> 12:50.003
How is that my fault?

12:50.037 --> 12:53.807
Before you crashed in that pod,
I had a great life,

12:53.841 --> 12:57.945
with two great parents.
And now all I have is you.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.779
And you are not worth it.

13:09.589 --> 13:11.524

13:22.035 --> 13:25.105
[dispatcher]
We've got a male body,
approximately 17 years of age.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.207
Found on the side of
Highberry Road.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.211
Great Rao.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.086
[crying] That's my friend.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.421
Excuse me, miss.

14:15.122 --> 14:16.489
Kara, Kara.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.625
You can't go down there.
You can't.

14:18.658 --> 14:21.594
That's my friend.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.064
That's my friend.

14:28.135 --> 14:29.769
[girl] I heard it was like
super bloody.

14:29.802 --> 14:33.173
[boy 1] He was shot.
I bet it's drugs.
It's always drugs.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.541
[boy 2] I heard they think
it's a serial killer.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.009
How cool would that be?

14:39.146 --> 14:41.514
Kara. Kara.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.150
They didn't even know him.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.885
None of these people did.

14:47.687 --> 14:50.991
But now that he's dead,
they're crying?

14:53.293 --> 14:55.062
-It's sad.
-You didn't know him.

14:55.095 --> 14:58.131
You don't care.
You're just as bad as they are.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.568
Alex, come on,
we're gonna be late.

15:04.437 --> 15:07.274
Oh, my God,
they killed Kenny. [laughs]

15:07.307 --> 15:08.275
Well, someone did.

15:08.308 --> 15:11.578
Smug little nerd was
begging for a beatdown.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.288
Why'd you do it, Jake?

15:21.321 --> 15:23.456
Hey, Danvers,
did you come for
a little peep show?

15:23.490 --> 15:24.657
What did Kenny know about you?

15:24.691 --> 15:26.659
What, are you
on your period or something?

15:26.693 --> 15:28.996
He knew something about you,
so you hurt him.

15:29.029 --> 15:30.998
Maybe or maybe
he was just a born loser

15:31.031 --> 15:32.499
and someone
put him out of his misery.

15:33.333 --> 15:34.534
-Admit what you did!
-[groans]

15:34.567 --> 15:36.203
I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:36.236 --> 15:38.505
-I want to hear you say it!
-Ow! All right! All right!

15:38.538 --> 15:40.140
He caught me smoking pot.
He said he would tell.

15:40.173 --> 15:42.075
That's why I was always
giving him crap.

15:44.577 --> 15:48.015
That's it? Where were you
last night?

15:48.048 --> 15:50.417
At home. All night.
My mom can vouch.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.089
-[Sheriff] We don't have a lot
to go on here.
-[knocking on door]

15:56.123 --> 15:58.325
Whoever did this
covered their tracks
really well.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.727
Frankly, we need your help.

16:00.760 --> 16:05.065
I'm so sorry to even ask this,
but did Kenny have
any enemies?

16:05.098 --> 16:07.500
Anyone that would have
wished him ill?

16:07.534 --> 16:12.039
Amy, I can't imagine
what you and Lloyd are
going through right now.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.673
We're going to catch
Kenny's killer,

16:13.706 --> 16:16.643
-but time is of the essence--
-Mrs. Li?

16:18.311 --> 16:21.281
-You can't be in here.
-Kara.

16:21.314 --> 16:25.318
Mrs. Li, I just wanted to say
how very sorry I am

16:25.352 --> 16:26.519
for what's happened to Kenny.

16:26.553 --> 16:29.422
He always said such
nice things about you.

16:29.456 --> 16:31.224
I really like him, too.

16:32.792 --> 16:34.094
Liked.

16:36.363 --> 16:37.597
Have you seen
Kenny's telescope?

16:37.630 --> 16:39.232
I can't find it.

16:40.267 --> 16:42.001
It was his favorite thing,

16:42.535 --> 16:44.071
I can't find it.

16:44.104 --> 16:47.074
What's the point?
He doesn't need it anymore.

16:48.075 --> 16:51.211
I'll find it for you, Mrs. Li.
I promise.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.815
Come on, sweetheart,
let's give them some space.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.250
I didn't mean to make her--

16:57.284 --> 16:59.352
I know, they're not
themselves right now.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.020
How are you holding up?

17:01.554 --> 17:02.822
I'm okay.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.225
Look, I know you have
hound blood in you,

17:05.258 --> 17:07.527
but don't go hunting
that telescope, you hear?

17:07.560 --> 17:09.296
No coming anywhere near this.

17:09.329 --> 17:10.563
This is dangerous stuff, Kara.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.565
I don't want you
getting caught up in this.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.068
Yes, sir.

17:15.102 --> 17:18.138
I'm gonna find out
who did this. I promise.

17:18.171 --> 17:21.174
-You want a ride home?
-No, I'll walk.

17:21.841 --> 17:23.076
Okay.

17:48.168 --> 17:49.402
[leaves crunching]

17:53.306 --> 17:54.274
What the hell?

17:54.307 --> 17:57.210
Sorry. It happens sometimes
when I get scared.

17:57.244 --> 17:58.411
Get it under control.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.749
This morning, did you see him?

18:06.286 --> 18:07.620
What did he look like?

18:08.721 --> 18:10.323
What are you doing here?

18:13.893 --> 18:16.696
I was failing calc.
All right?

18:16.729 --> 18:18.431
You're not
the only one with a secret.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.267
Kenny offered to tutor me.

18:20.300 --> 18:23.270
He knew I wouldn't want
anyone to find out,

18:23.303 --> 18:24.671
so we would come out here.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.775
I just wanted to
think about him.

18:29.509 --> 18:30.777
What are you doing here?

18:31.711 --> 18:33.713
I was here with
Kenny last night.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.216
We were stargazing.

18:37.850 --> 18:40.687
Mrs. Li said that
Kenny's telescope is missing,

18:40.720 --> 18:44.491
but this is the last place
it could have been
and it's not here.

18:44.524 --> 18:46.893
-And neither is his laptop.
-Laptop?

18:46.926 --> 18:49.196
It was a part of some project
he was working on.

18:49.229 --> 18:51.364
It took pictures
of what the telescope saw.

18:51.398 --> 18:53.733
Maybe one night Kenny
saw something
he shouldn't have.

18:53.766 --> 18:55.368
Maybe he took a picture of it.

18:55.402 --> 18:56.503
We have to find that laptop.

18:56.536 --> 18:58.738
-It's too dark.
-For me.

19:20.427 --> 19:21.428
I got it.

19:23.463 --> 19:26.299
Look, if he hid it, there's
gotta be something pretty
important on it.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.934
We have to get this
to Sheriff Collins.

19:27.967 --> 19:31.404
We will, eventually.
But we need more information.

19:31.438 --> 19:32.805
We've tampered with evidence,

19:32.839 --> 19:34.841
and you were the last person
to see Kenny alive.

19:34.874 --> 19:37.744
Do the math.
We've gotta get this home.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.681
[Young Alex] This thing looks
water damaged.

19:41.714 --> 19:44.551
After being outside all night,
I can't believe it's even on.

19:44.584 --> 19:48.288
Um, Clark has a friend
named Chloe
who might be able to help.

19:48.321 --> 19:50.890
She really loves
weird tech stuff like this.

19:50.923 --> 19:51.791
Um...

19:51.824 --> 19:54.394
She even has this
whole "wall of weird."

19:54.427 --> 19:56.329
Okay, I've no idea what
any of that means,

19:56.363 --> 19:58.865
but send her a zip drive
of everything we find.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.668
What are those?

20:01.701 --> 20:04.604
Looks encrypted.
What are we looking for, Kara?

20:04.637 --> 20:06.973
Anything that leads to someone.

20:07.006 --> 20:09.409
I thought it was Jake,
but he has an alibi--

20:09.442 --> 20:12.245
Okay, yeah, don't expect
anyone to thank you for
finding out the QB

20:12.279 --> 20:15.548
was smoking pot and
getting him suspended from
school, by the way.

20:15.582 --> 20:18.818
Whatever. Kenny's
more important.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.756
When I was in his house,

20:23.790 --> 20:27.627
his dad was acting weird,
maybe it was him.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.362
Hello, darkness.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.365
Try his e-mail.

20:32.599 --> 20:33.566
[beeps]

20:35.335 --> 20:37.570
Why would Kenny
send that to Mr. Bernard?

20:37.604 --> 20:39.372
There's an attachment.

20:41.508 --> 20:44.311
Oh, my God. Is that Josie?

20:44.344 --> 20:46.346
And Mr. Bernard.

20:54.787 --> 20:55.988
Alex, hey.

20:57.990 --> 20:59.526
I need to talk to you.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.300
I have another one.

21:07.334 --> 21:10.337
-This is none of your business.
-It is if Mr. Bernard
killed Kenny.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.305
Is that freak who's living
in your room
rubbing off on you?

21:12.339 --> 21:13.506
Because you sound insane.

21:13.540 --> 21:16.709
Josie, we have been
best friends
since we were eight.

21:16.743 --> 21:18.811
But a kid is dead.

21:18.845 --> 21:21.681
We need to take this
to the cops. Together.

21:22.415 --> 21:23.683
Alex, please.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.786
Please don't tell my mom.

21:26.819 --> 21:29.922
I know Kenny tried
to make Mr. Bernard stop.

21:29.956 --> 21:30.923
I told him to stay out of it.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.526
-Was Mr. Bernard angry?
-His name is Samuel.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.962
-What? Do you think--
-I love him.

21:37.029 --> 21:38.531
And he loves me.

21:38.565 --> 21:40.600
You are delusional.

21:40.633 --> 21:43.836
Mr. Bernard is a grown-up
sleeping with a minor.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.938
That is disgusting and illegal.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.306
He's 27. I'm 17.

21:47.340 --> 21:50.076
In five years, nobody will
even care about the age
difference.

21:50.109 --> 21:51.811
In five years,
he'll be halfway through

21:51.844 --> 21:54.313
his sentence for
statutory rape.

21:56.015 --> 21:59.452
-Are we done here?
-No.

21:59.486 --> 22:02.722
Kenny sent Mr. Bernard
an e-mail
the night before he died.

22:03.990 --> 22:06.626
How did Mr. Bernard react?

22:06.659 --> 22:10.029
He was pissed that
a nerdy little Peeping Tom
was messing with him.

22:10.062 --> 22:13.533
Anybody would be.
But he didn't kill him.

22:13.566 --> 22:16.002
If he's the kind of guy
who would hurt you,

22:16.035 --> 22:19.138
he's probably the kind of
guy who would hurt someone
who found out.

22:19.171 --> 22:22.675
God, you so don't get it.
No one hurt me.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.110
If you don't go to the police,
you'll regret it.

22:24.143 --> 22:26.546
-Just stay out of it.
-Like Kenny should have?

22:32.018 --> 22:33.420
[keypad beeps]

22:35.655 --> 22:37.757
I have a tip
on the murder of Kenny Li.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.764
Alex Danvers knows.

22:48.067 --> 22:50.136
-[Young Alex] I'm so mad.
-I feel sorry for her.

22:50.169 --> 22:53.139
I do, too. But she should
want to help Kenny at least.

22:53.172 --> 22:55.007
Even if it means
she gets in trouble.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.009
It's not just about
getting in trouble.

22:57.043 --> 23:00.713
When people find out
bout her and Bernard,
they're gonna blame her.

23:00.747 --> 23:01.781
No, they won't.

23:01.814 --> 23:04.050
They already blame Kenny
for what happened to him.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.719
I just keep thinking
if I'd stayed with him,

23:06.753 --> 23:09.789
I could have protected him.
And he'd still be here.

23:09.822 --> 23:11.524
Hey, Kenny wouldn't blame you.

23:11.558 --> 23:12.692
He wouldn't want you
to think that.

23:12.725 --> 23:15.462
Well, whoever did this thinks
they can get away with it

23:15.495 --> 23:16.896
because Kenny was invisible.

23:16.929 --> 23:18.765
But we have to make sure
that they don't.

23:18.798 --> 23:20.099
We will.

23:22.201 --> 23:24.737
This is the first time
we've walked home together.

23:24.771 --> 23:26.706
[chuckles]

23:26.739 --> 23:31.644
Yeah. Well, you suck less
than a lot of people today.

23:34.046 --> 23:35.414
Alex!

23:37.684 --> 23:38.685
[tires screeching]

23:46.659 --> 23:47.560
[siren chirping]

23:47.594 --> 23:49.829
We've got a dark-colored
four-door sedan.

23:49.862 --> 23:51.197
It was Mr. Bernard.

23:51.230 --> 23:52.832
He ran us off the road.

23:56.102 --> 23:57.504
Girls!

23:59.038 --> 24:00.139
Girls!

24:00.172 --> 24:02.108
Oh, my God. Thank goodness.

24:06.178 --> 24:08.715
Alex, do your homework.
Kara, come with me.

24:08.748 --> 24:12.218
I had to do something.
I couldn't let Mr. Bernard
get away with it.

24:12.251 --> 24:15.454
You could have been discovered.
Alex could've died.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.323
I'm sorry.

24:17.356 --> 24:20.192
I have been trying to tell you,
it is not your job
to protect people.

24:20.226 --> 24:22.094
You're just a kid.

24:22.128 --> 24:25.598
And since you won't listen
to me, maybe you will
listen to her.

24:34.874 --> 24:35.875
Mom?

24:41.748 --> 24:42.782
Mom!

24:42.815 --> 24:44.016
[woman] Oh.

24:45.151 --> 24:47.019
I'm sorry, honey,
I'm not your mother.

24:47.954 --> 24:50.289
I'm Agent Noel Neill
of the FBI.

24:50.322 --> 24:53.726
I'm sorry, you just look
so much like my mother.

24:53.760 --> 24:54.661
For a second I thought--

24:54.694 --> 24:56.295
I guess I just have
one of those faces.

24:56.328 --> 24:58.497
It's an asset in my
line of work.

24:58.931 --> 25:00.032
Yeah.

25:00.066 --> 25:02.769
I've come here due to
a recent uptick in activity.

25:04.003 --> 25:06.539
We are aware of you
and your cousin.

25:06.573 --> 25:09.709
Now, I understand that you
had a friend that
passed recently,

25:09.742 --> 25:12.011
and now you and your sister
have taken it upon yourselves

25:12.044 --> 25:13.713
to solve this case.

25:13.746 --> 25:15.014
His name was Kenny Li.

25:15.047 --> 25:17.584
I'm very sorry. But you need

25:17.617 --> 25:19.952
to understand that
under no circumstances

25:19.986 --> 25:22.121
are you to be utilizing
your powers.

25:22.154 --> 25:24.891
-But we solved the case.
-I heard.

25:24.924 --> 25:26.993
Right before you and
your sister were driven
off the road.

25:27.026 --> 25:27.960
We're fine.

25:27.994 --> 25:30.296
You're fine
because you're invincible.

25:30.329 --> 25:32.799
Your sister was fine
because she got lucky.

25:32.832 --> 25:34.200
I saved her.

25:34.233 --> 25:38.037
I solved a crime.
I can do what Superman does.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.172
No, you cannot.
You are 15 years old,

25:40.206 --> 25:41.641
and as long as you're living
in this house,

25:41.674 --> 25:43.676
your powers are a danger
to Alex and Eliza.

25:43.710 --> 25:46.012
What good are these powers
if I can't use them?

25:46.045 --> 25:49.782
Miss Danvers, I am sure
that when your parents sent
you here, they wanted--

25:49.816 --> 25:53.085
Don't talk about my parents.
You didn't even know them.

25:53.119 --> 25:55.221
I'm sorry, you're right.

25:55.254 --> 25:57.624
You should probably be
with your family right now.

25:57.657 --> 25:59.959
This isn't my family.

25:59.992 --> 26:01.794
I remember my parents.

26:02.695 --> 26:04.330
I remember Krypton.

26:04.363 --> 26:06.866
I remember being alone
in that pod

26:06.899 --> 26:09.802
and not knowing if I was
going to see
anyone ever again.

26:09.836 --> 26:11.170
And then I landed here.

26:11.203 --> 26:14.974
And no one asked me if
I wanted these powers,

26:15.007 --> 26:16.609
but I have them.

26:18.010 --> 26:21.681
And all I want to do is
help people with what
I've been given,

26:21.714 --> 26:23.082
and no one will let me.

26:23.115 --> 26:26.118
I can't imagine what
you've had to overcome.

26:26.953 --> 26:28.220
Kara.

26:28.254 --> 26:31.590
I know that your mother
is very proud of you.

26:32.391 --> 26:34.593
This is never going to be home.

26:35.695 --> 26:36.863
I hate it here.

26:37.864 --> 26:40.132
I hate school.

26:40.166 --> 26:43.670
I just want to live with Clark
and be super.

26:43.703 --> 26:46.138
You've got a second
chance here.

26:46.873 --> 26:48.641
But you have to be normal.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.377
You have to be human.

26:52.745 --> 26:54.881
Why don't you tell me
about Krypton?

26:57.684 --> 26:59.151
Where was it?

27:00.853 --> 27:01.921
There.

27:01.954 --> 27:04.623
You've already lost so much.

27:05.758 --> 27:08.627
But you could lose more
if you're not careful.

27:09.996 --> 27:12.131
[speaking Kryptonese]

27:14.734 --> 27:17.169
I'm sorry, sweetheart,
I don't know
what you're saying.

27:18.370 --> 27:20.139
Right.

27:20.172 --> 27:22.274
There's no reason you should.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.711
No more powers? You promise?

27:26.178 --> 27:28.681
-I promise.
-All right, then.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.769
[sighs]

27:51.938 --> 27:53.339
[engine starts]

27:58.811 --> 27:59.879
[knocking at door]

28:05.752 --> 28:07.319
-Josie.
-You told, didn't you?

28:07.353 --> 28:09.321
-I had to.
-My dad has lost it.

28:09.355 --> 28:11.791
I'm grounded until college,
and Samuel, he's in jail.

28:11.824 --> 28:15.061
He killed Kenny, Josie.
He tried to kill Kara and me.

28:15.094 --> 28:17.063
No, he didn't.
I asked him, okay?

28:17.096 --> 28:19.431
I went to his house
after school,
and we talked about it.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.803
-You were with him
after school?
-Yes.

28:23.836 --> 28:25.071
I was at his house
when they arrested him.

28:25.104 --> 28:26.405
You were with him
the whole time?

28:26.438 --> 28:28.140
You were supposed
to be my friend.
You said you'd protect me.

28:28.174 --> 28:30.409
-Were you with him?
-Yes, are you happy?

28:40.887 --> 28:42.221
[door opens]

28:42.254 --> 28:44.223
Josie was with Bernard
this afternoon.

28:44.256 --> 28:45.792
She was there when
he got arrested.

28:45.825 --> 28:47.259
-So?
-This means that there's no way

28:47.293 --> 28:50.062
he could have run us
off the road.
Someone else did.

28:50.096 --> 28:52.498
Maybe Bernard
didn't kill Kenny.

28:52.531 --> 28:54.533
-It's not our problem.
-It is now.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.903
We scared someone enough
that they came after us.

28:56.936 --> 28:58.337
They're not going to stop.

29:00.572 --> 29:04.343
-What happened down there?
-No powers.

29:04.376 --> 29:07.079
No more trying to be
a superhero.

29:07.113 --> 29:08.981
But we've come so far.

29:09.015 --> 29:10.516
If we stop now,
what's the point?

29:10.549 --> 29:14.453
It's not a game.
You almost died tonight.

29:14.486 --> 29:18.024
Kenny's dead.
Nothing we do can change that.

29:19.892 --> 29:22.394
I'm human now.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.864
I thought we were doing
something important together.

29:25.898 --> 29:28.801
Well, we're not anymore.

29:30.002 --> 29:31.337
Where are you going?

29:31.370 --> 29:33.305
To find someone who's
gonna help me
catch Kenny's killer.

29:38.244 --> 29:40.246
[cheerleaders chanting]

29:42.214 --> 29:44.250
[upbeat music playing]

29:45.184 --> 29:47.353
[crowd cheering]

29:54.060 --> 29:55.327
Sheriff Collins.

29:55.995 --> 29:56.963
Hey, sweetheart.

29:56.996 --> 29:58.197
I have to talk to you
about the hit-and-run.

29:58.230 --> 30:02.034
It wasn't Mr. Bernard.
He was with Josie
all afternoon.

30:02.068 --> 30:04.904
What, now, did Josie
tell you that? Because
between you and me,

30:04.937 --> 30:07.874
she's saying just about
anything to keep that teacher
out of trouble.

30:07.907 --> 30:09.341
I don't think
she's lying about this.

30:09.375 --> 30:10.442
I know you want
to believe your friend,

30:10.476 --> 30:12.144
but she's in a real
messed-up place
right now.

30:12.178 --> 30:13.545
We found Kenny's laptop
in the woods.

30:13.579 --> 30:15.314
It has all of these
pictures on it.

30:15.347 --> 30:17.183
Stuff he had seen
through his telescope

30:17.216 --> 30:18.985
that people wouldn't want
anyone to know.

30:19.018 --> 30:22.388
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down.
What exactly is on that laptop?

30:22.421 --> 30:24.991
One of the pictures showed
Mr. Bernard with Josie.

30:25.024 --> 30:27.326
But there were other pictures.
We'll get them soon,

30:27.359 --> 30:30.196
and I am sure Kenny's killer
is in one of them.

30:30.229 --> 30:31.898
I know we should have
told you sooner, but--

30:31.931 --> 30:34.600
It's okay. You're doing
the right thing now.

30:35.134 --> 30:36.835
[crowd cheering]

30:37.904 --> 30:39.405
Let's go inside.

30:41.941 --> 30:43.109
[beeping]

30:48.647 --> 30:51.650
[Collins] You and Kara are
quite the little detectives.

30:51.683 --> 30:54.353
You ever think about going
into law enforcement?

30:54.386 --> 30:57.056
No, not really.
Science is kind of my thing.

30:57.089 --> 30:59.391
Well, if you ever want to
trade in your microscope
for a badge,

30:59.425 --> 31:00.893
you let me know.

31:02.161 --> 31:03.495
I think we can talk here.

31:03.529 --> 31:06.365
Well, I don't want anyone
to interrupt us.

31:24.150 --> 31:25.617
Holy crap!

31:28.154 --> 31:31.123
So, where's that magical laptop
full of evidence, Alex?

31:31.157 --> 31:32.358
[cell phone ringing]

31:32.391 --> 31:33.926
I have to take this.

31:35.962 --> 31:36.963
[Young Kara]
Alex! Where are you?

31:36.996 --> 31:39.465
I just got Kenny's pictures
back from Chloe.

31:39.498 --> 31:42.434
And there's pictures
of Sheriff Collins.

31:42.468 --> 31:44.536
I think he's a part
of a drug deal
or something.

31:44.570 --> 31:47.573
The time stamp is the night
Kenny died.

31:47.606 --> 31:51.377
Okay, cool, just tell mom
I'll be home after the game.

31:58.184 --> 32:01.453
Alex, you gotta know
I really am sorry about this.

32:06.525 --> 32:10.662
Kenny, the bridge...
The whole time, it was you.

32:10.696 --> 32:13.299
-This whole time, it was you.
-Where's the laptop?

32:13.332 --> 32:15.701
I mailed it to the new station.
They'll get it tomorrow.

32:15.734 --> 32:18.570
No. I don't think so, honey.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.407
Go ahead and give me
that phone.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.582
[cell phone ringing]

32:30.616 --> 32:33.752
-Alex! You have to
get back here.
-Kara, the stadium! He's here.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.387
[line disconnects]

32:35.421 --> 32:36.989
Well,

32:37.023 --> 32:39.325
I know where the laptop is.

32:39.358 --> 32:42.661
You know, I told
your sister at the Li's
not to get involved,

32:42.694 --> 32:46.398
and the two of you still
went down in the woods
looking for trouble.

32:46.432 --> 32:47.633
After you.

32:54.740 --> 32:56.342
Screw it.

33:01.213 --> 33:03.182
Kenny saw you.

33:03.215 --> 33:05.517
He should have kept
that telescope
up in the sky.

33:06.752 --> 33:09.588
He was such a smart kid.
Good kid.

33:09.621 --> 33:11.390
He was my friend.

33:11.423 --> 33:13.525
I didn't want to hurt him.

33:14.493 --> 33:16.128
What did you want?

33:16.162 --> 33:17.496
A little compensation, maybe.

33:17.529 --> 33:20.432
Get paid like a dog
protecting spoiled rich folks.

33:20.466 --> 33:22.668
Drugs come over the border
from Canada,

33:22.701 --> 33:24.136
hardly even hide it.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.238
Must think I'm a joke.

33:26.272 --> 33:27.806
The government,
they want me to burn it.

33:27.839 --> 33:31.710
Why not get a little
something back
for myself? That's all.

33:31.743 --> 33:34.213
Yeah. Real heartbreaking.

33:34.246 --> 33:38.417
You're a scumbag
who kills kids to
cover his own ass.

33:38.450 --> 33:40.686
-You're pathetic.
-You're real brave.

33:42.221 --> 33:43.555
Not even screaming.

33:44.490 --> 33:46.092
Not that anyone could hear you.

33:46.125 --> 33:47.793
Someone's listening right now.

33:47.826 --> 33:49.395
[whooshing]

33:49.428 --> 33:52.398
Someone who can hear
every single word you say

33:52.431 --> 33:55.534
every time you breathe.
Can you feel it?

33:56.702 --> 33:58.237
She's coming.

34:01.173 --> 34:02.741
Here! I'm down here!

34:13.552 --> 34:16.755
-Are you okay?
-Duh, I knew you would come.

34:20.492 --> 34:22.361
-[bell ringing]
-[indistinct chatter]

34:24.130 --> 34:26.198
-Hey, Josie.
-Don't talk to me.

34:33.672 --> 34:34.740
Can I sit here?

34:35.774 --> 34:37.209
Uh, sure.

34:44.550 --> 34:47.886
So, we found out
the douche quarterback

34:47.919 --> 34:50.156
was smoking pot,
caught a predator,

34:50.189 --> 34:51.823
and solved a murder.

34:51.857 --> 34:53.825
We're doing pretty
great this week.

34:53.859 --> 34:55.861
And everybody hates us.

34:55.894 --> 34:57.396
You'll get used to it.

34:58.364 --> 34:59.765
Being on the outside.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.402
I only wish Kenny were here.

35:05.237 --> 35:07.506
Speaking of, um...

35:07.539 --> 35:10.342
Chloe found something else
on the laptop.

35:10.376 --> 35:13.379
She deleted it from
the rest of the files,

35:13.412 --> 35:14.780
but she sent me a copy.

35:19.785 --> 35:20.786
[chuckles]

35:20.819 --> 35:21.920
He knew.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.622
And he didn't tell.

35:23.655 --> 35:27.593
The last time I saw him,
he tried to kiss me.

35:28.294 --> 35:29.561
I panicked.

35:31.397 --> 35:33.899
But if he were here,

35:33.932 --> 35:36.335
I'd kiss him
in front of everyone.

35:37.936 --> 35:39.538
He liked me.

35:40.606 --> 35:42.274
All of me.

35:46.512 --> 35:49.548
Well, I guess I don't have
plans tonight.

35:50.582 --> 35:51.717
Or ever.

35:53.285 --> 35:54.753
Wanna hang out?

35:55.921 --> 35:57.356
Yeah.

35:57.956 --> 35:59.925
Yeah, definitely.

35:59.958 --> 36:03.195
We could go flying.
I won't tell Mom.

36:03.229 --> 36:04.530
I don't think so.

36:04.563 --> 36:08.434
-Why not?
-'Cause you almost died. Twice.

36:10.636 --> 36:13.639
I'd rather be human
than risk losing you.

36:18.777 --> 36:21.413
I've never had a sister.

36:23.982 --> 36:26.452
I promise I'll
get better at it.

36:31.457 --> 36:32.691
-[girls giggling]
-[knocking on door]

36:32.724 --> 36:35.327
We're turning the lights off,
we swear.

36:36.995 --> 36:39.465
-Oh, my God
-Where was it?

36:39.498 --> 36:41.567
It was found in the
Sheriff's car.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.602
Mrs. Li thought you two
should have it.

36:45.271 --> 36:46.872
I think it's a thank you.

36:46.905 --> 36:51.343
For what it's worth,
I am so proud of both of you.

36:56.615 --> 36:57.883
Lights out.

37:04.790 --> 37:07.693
-Good night, Alex.
-Good night, Kara.

37:16.368 --> 37:18.737
-Kara?
-Yeah.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.772
Can I use the bathroom
first tomorrow?

37:21.673 --> 37:23.375
Sure.

37:35.354 --> 37:36.922
[birds chirping]

37:48.066 --> 37:49.501
[groans]

38:05.116 --> 38:06.652
You slept in.

38:07.419 --> 38:09.020
-Yeah.
-Good.

38:09.955 --> 38:11.857
Remember this thing?

38:11.890 --> 38:16.395
That was the best thank you
gift we ever got
for solving a case.

38:16.428 --> 38:18.697
Kenny was one of
the first people
I lost on Earth.

38:21.132 --> 38:22.734
It doesn't get any easier.

38:24.870 --> 38:26.004
Kenny Li.

38:27.072 --> 38:28.807
Keeper of secrets.

38:31.377 --> 38:34.980
That's the first time I really
understood what I had in you,

38:36.848 --> 38:39.050
what it could mean
to have a sister.

38:39.084 --> 38:42.120
It's crazy to think that
I ever thought that you were

38:42.153 --> 38:44.823
the worst thing that
could happen to me.

38:46.091 --> 38:47.593
I'd never get over it.

38:47.893 --> 38:49.060
[chuckles]

38:50.161 --> 38:52.698
-Well, I did hog
the bathroom.
-Yes.

38:52.731 --> 38:53.899
[laughs]

38:53.932 --> 38:56.968
After Kenny,
that's when I realized

38:57.002 --> 38:59.671
that you and I could
get through anything together.

38:59.705 --> 39:02.107
That's the first time
I really became Kara Danvers.

39:02.140 --> 39:05.477
It's a good thing, too.
It got us through
the next ten years.

39:05.511 --> 39:06.878
I remember

39:07.946 --> 39:11.417
thinking I would never feel
at home on Earth.

39:11.450 --> 39:13.752
I still don't, in a way.

39:15.554 --> 39:17.723
But I feel at home with you.

39:18.757 --> 39:19.891
Always.

39:21.893 --> 39:23.462
[sighs]

39:23.495 --> 39:25.964
It was a good idea,
coming here.

39:27.933 --> 39:30.602
I don't think I could have
slept in any other bed
last night

39:30.636 --> 39:32.771
without Maggie.

39:32.804 --> 39:35.441
I'm sorry I punished you
for trying to help.

39:35.474 --> 39:37.108
[sighs] It was your turn.

39:37.142 --> 39:39.110
-I never want to hurt you.
-I know.

39:41.947 --> 39:43.649
I am getting better.

39:46.017 --> 39:48.620
Sorry I haven't shown it.

39:48.654 --> 39:52.458
Maybe if I had, you'd have
more hope right now.

39:52.491 --> 39:53.792
You're here.

39:54.860 --> 39:56.862
Right now, that's all
I really need.

39:59.765 --> 40:00.799
Good.

40:06.972 --> 40:08.540
[keys jangling]

40:09.741 --> 40:13.078
Sandwiches, sparkling water
and pie.

40:13.111 --> 40:14.613
You are the best.

40:14.646 --> 40:16.682
Think about what I said.

40:17.215 --> 40:18.617
I will.

40:19.818 --> 40:21.887
-I love you.
-I love you.

40:25.991 --> 40:29.060
Strong girl. Brave girl.

40:29.094 --> 40:30.562
Not yet.

40:30.962 --> 40:32.564
No rush.

40:33.532 --> 40:35.834
-I love you.
-I love you.

40:37.068 --> 40:38.203
Drive safely.

40:38.236 --> 40:39.805
-We will.
-[cell phone chimes]

40:39.838 --> 40:42.674
So, J'onn says to head
straight back to the DEO,

40:42.708 --> 40:44.943
and if we scratch his car,
he'll put us in containment.

40:44.976 --> 40:46.678
Well, you better
let me drive, then.

40:46.712 --> 40:47.646
Why? I'm a great driver.

40:47.679 --> 40:49.214
You almost killed us twice
coming up here.

40:49.247 --> 40:51.883
That possum came from nowhere.

40:51.917 --> 40:54.119
Keys. Come on.

40:55.987 --> 40:57.589
If you're so worried
about my driving,

40:57.623 --> 40:58.857
why didn't you
say anything yesterday?

40:58.890 --> 41:00.926
Because yesterday,
getting into an accident

41:00.959 --> 41:04.863
didn't seem like a big deal.
Today, I would
like to avoid it.

41:05.163 --> 41:06.164
Progress.

41:06.832 --> 41:08.700
All right.

41:08.734 --> 41:11.537
-[engine starts]

playing on stereo]

41:11.570 --> 41:13.171
-Classic.
-Yep, turn it up.

41:23.214 --> 41:25.016
[both vocalizing]

41:29.020 --> 41:35.994
* If I could escape
And recreate a place
That's my own world *

41:36.027 --> 41:42.100
* And I could be your
Favorite girl
Forever, perfectly together *

41:42.133 --> 41:45.537
* Tell me boy now
Wouldn't that be sweet? *

41:45.571 --> 41:47.539
* Sweet escape, sweet escape
