00:01.960 --> 00:04.421
- Oh, Gabby, you ready
for some big fun?

00:04.504 --> 00:06.297
- Dad, I'm not gonna help you
test your old pens

00:06.381 --> 00:08.967
to see which ones don't work.

00:09.050 --> 00:12.095
- I'm talking about
this big fun.

00:12.178 --> 00:12.762
- It's clock.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.389
- It's not a clock.

00:14.472 --> 00:17.058
It's a photograph of a clock.

00:17.142 --> 00:20.019
- I feel so stupid.

00:20.103 --> 00:24.023
- This is image one
in my new photographic series--

00:24.107 --> 00:26.443
"Time Pieces."

00:26.526 --> 00:29.028
It's an antique grandfather
clock in my accountant's office.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.947
- Wow, that was
just so many boring things

00:31.030 --> 00:33.783
coming at me at once.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.119
- This outta wake you up.

00:36.202 --> 00:38.413
Ha, ha!

00:38.496 --> 00:40.248
It's an alarm clock.

00:40.331 --> 00:42.792
I used forced perspective
to draw your eye

00:42.876 --> 00:45.128
to the snooze button.

00:45.211 --> 00:49.090
- Is it too late
to break out the pens?

00:49.174 --> 00:51.259
- You just don't know art
when you see it.

00:51.342 --> 00:52.635
But I think I'm on to something.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.637
And people
are gonna appreciate these.

00:54.721 --> 00:55.805
I'm gonna put 'em in an album

00:55.889 --> 00:57.474
and pass 'em
around at the hospital.

00:57.557 --> 01:02.645
- Or you could not be ancient
and put them up on Instagram.

01:02.729 --> 01:03.480
Let me back up.

01:03.563 --> 01:07.358
There's a thing
called Instagram.

01:07.442 --> 01:10.528
- I know what Instagram is.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.572
It's one of those grams
you get instantly.

01:12.655 --> 01:13.448
I don't know.

01:13.531 --> 01:15.450
Tell me what it is.

01:15.533 --> 01:17.410
- It's where people
post pictures.

01:17.494 --> 01:18.369
Check it.

01:18.453 --> 01:19.829
Here's my feed.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.499
I took this selfie on my way
to school this morning.

01:22.582 --> 01:24.000
- In front of the Eiffel Tower.

01:24.083 --> 01:25.335
How'd you do that?

01:25.418 --> 01:27.462
- Photoshop.

01:27.545 --> 01:31.925
- You still go
to a photo shop, and I'm old.

01:32.008 --> 01:35.845
- Dad, I can only catch you up
one thing at a time.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.598
- Why do you mess around taking
silly pictures of yourself?

01:38.681 --> 01:40.683
A camera gives you
the opportunity

01:40.767 --> 01:42.519
to create something of value.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.145
- This selfie's valuable.

01:44.229 --> 01:45.772
It got me ten more followers.

01:45.855 --> 01:47.232
I'm up to 500.

01:47.315 --> 01:50.235
- Five hundred people are
looking at your fake selfies?

01:50.318 --> 01:52.654
- Uh, imagine how many people
will follow

01:52.737 --> 01:56.491
"Clock behind Pharmacist"?

01:56.574 --> 01:59.619
- I'm imagining zero.

01:59.702 --> 02:00.745
- You'll see.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.872
I'm gonna
post my clock pictures,

02:02.956 --> 02:04.874
and get all sorts of followers.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.001
It's my time.

02:07.085 --> 02:09.545
Literally.

02:09.628 --> 02:12.715
- I cannot find one pen
in this house that works.

02:12.799 --> 02:15.718
Charlie,
when's the next pen day?

02:15.802 --> 02:18.179
- I got called into
the principal's office today.

02:18.263 --> 02:19.389
Can you believe that?

02:19.472 --> 02:22.058
- Well, it is a school day.

02:22.141 --> 02:23.017
- What'd you do?

02:23.101 --> 02:23.977
- Nothing.

02:24.060 --> 02:25.061
I just wore this shirt,

02:25.144 --> 02:26.896
which apparently violates
the dress code.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.065
- Since when does your school
have a dress code?

02:29.149 --> 02:30.733
- Since we got a new principal.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.026
We're not allowed
to wear jewelry.

02:32.110 --> 02:33.528
And he called this a necklace.

02:33.611 --> 02:36.573
I was like, "What?"

02:36.656 --> 02:39.033
- That's not a necklace,
that's a collar chain.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.577
- That's what I told him.

02:40.660 --> 02:43.580
Actually, I said it was a dangly
thing attached to my neck flaps,

02:43.663 --> 02:46.082
but he knew what I meant.

02:46.165 --> 02:48.167
- Sorry, buddy, at least
you can wear it on the weekends.

02:48.251 --> 02:49.878
- I should be able to wear it
when I want.

02:49.961 --> 02:51.754
It's my shirt, it's my style.

02:51.838 --> 02:54.424
Without my style, all I've got
is my way with the ladies.

02:54.507 --> 02:58.845
I'm lying, I've got nothing.

02:58.928 --> 03:00.889
- Oh, quit clutching
your pearls.

03:00.972 --> 03:02.015
It's just one shirt.

03:02.098 --> 03:03.266
- It's not just one shirt.

03:03.349 --> 03:04.601
He's getting rid of everything.

03:04.684 --> 03:06.603
Sandals, hats, capes.

03:06.686 --> 03:10.607
- Who's wearing a cape?

03:10.690 --> 03:11.774
- This kid Super Greg.

03:11.858 --> 03:12.817
He's a seventh grader

03:12.901 --> 03:15.778
who thinks he's flying around
the lunchroom.

03:15.862 --> 03:18.907
They're trying him out
at regular school for a year.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.450
I've gotta find a way
to fight this.

03:20.533 --> 03:24.120
- No, no, no, you need to go
school and not make waves.

03:24.203 --> 03:25.121
- I'm with James.

03:25.204 --> 03:26.831
Make waves, start a revolution.

03:26.915 --> 03:29.208
Stick it to the man.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.085
- You really wanna stick it
to the man?

03:31.169 --> 03:32.962
Stay out of trouble,
get straight As

03:33.046 --> 03:34.881
and graduate with honors.

03:34.964 --> 03:38.301
The man will be
like "W-w-w-what?"

they decided to ban anything

04:02.325 --> 04:03.159
{\an8}that's distracting or unsafe,

04:03.242 --> 04:06.454
{\an8}but some of these things
are a stretch.

04:06.537 --> 04:07.413

04:19.926 --> 04:20.510
{\an8}- What new game?

04:20.593 --> 04:22.262
{\an8}- The one I ordered online.

04:22.345 --> 04:23.179
{\an8}- Did I say you can get that?

04:23.262 --> 04:25.473
{\an8}- You must have,
because if you didn't,

04:25.556 --> 04:27.016
{\an8}I'd be in a lot of trouble.

04:29.852 --> 04:31.646
{\an8}- All right, we've gone through
your whole closet,

04:31.729 --> 04:34.190
{\an8}and all that's left
is one of Gabby's old shirts

04:34.274 --> 04:35.733
{\an8}and your church clothes.

04:35.817 --> 04:36.818
{\an8}- At least I can still wear
my cool socks.

04:36.901 --> 04:37.902
{\an8}- Only if they match.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.237
{\an8}- My socks have to match?

04:39.320 --> 04:44.617
{\an8}I didn't realize
we were in 1980's Germany.

04:44.701 --> 04:46.452
{\an8}- Maybe we should stop
reading the dress code

04:46.536 --> 04:47.996
{\an8}and get you a history book?

04:48.079 --> 04:49.247
{\an8}- Why read history?

04:49.330 --> 04:50.289
{\an8}I'm gonna make it.

04:50.373 --> 04:51.874
{\an8}- I'm gonna fight the system.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.419
{\an8}In fact, I'm gonna tear down
this dress code

04:54.502 --> 04:56.504
{\an8}the same way Ronald Reagan
tore down

04:56.587 --> 04:58.256
{\an8}the Great Wall of China.

04:58.339 --> 05:01.009
{\an8}- Honey, you don't
even have to read a book.

05:01.092 --> 05:04.095
{\an8}They're placemats
that cover this stuff.

05:04.178 --> 05:06.264
{\an8}- No time, this
is the Revolutionary War,

05:06.347 --> 05:10.476
{\an8}and I'm George Jefferson.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.061
{\an8}- So, I set up my Instagram

05:12.145 --> 05:14.605
{\an8}and loaded it up
with my clock photographs.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.149
{\an8}Now my followers
should be arriving any minute.

05:16.232 --> 05:18.484
{\an8}- They won't
until you post something

05:18.568 --> 05:20.945
{\an8}people wanna actually look at.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.113
- Well, who doesn't
want to look

05:22.196 --> 05:24.282
at "Nurses' Station 7:15 a.m."?

05:24.365 --> 05:27.493
- Is it blurry
because it's an artistic choice?

05:27.577 --> 05:28.953
- No, because I just realized

05:29.037 --> 05:32.290
that I was supposed
to be in the OR at 7.

05:32.373 --> 05:33.499
What is all this?

05:33.583 --> 05:35.418
- Everything James isn't
allowed to wear at school

05:35.501 --> 05:36.419
anymore.

05:36.502 --> 05:37.503
- Well, it does seem
like overkill,

05:37.587 --> 05:39.255
but rules are rules.

05:39.338 --> 05:39.964
- Yeah, but if a rule is unfair.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.340
- Oh, don't bother, Steph.

05:41.424 --> 05:44.844
I got the rules are rules speech
when I made dad

05:44.927 --> 05:47.138
those funky scrubs
for Father's Day.

05:47.221 --> 05:49.807
- Hey, I would have worn them,
but there are very strict

05:49.891 --> 05:50.808
regulations about apparel

05:50.892 --> 05:53.853
that compromises the dignity
of the hospital.

05:53.936 --> 05:56.731
- What's undignified
about a big smiley face?

05:56.814 --> 05:59.442
- It's on the butt.

05:59.525 --> 06:00.651
Sorry about the scrubs,

06:00.735 --> 06:03.863
but if you don't
follow the rules, people die.

06:03.946 --> 06:08.034
That's what the posters
at the hospital say.

06:08.117 --> 06:12.622
Technically, they're about
washing your hands, but still.

06:21.672 --> 06:22.465
- What about tomorrow?

06:22.548 --> 06:23.633
I have a day off school.

06:23.716 --> 06:25.468

She's the one watching you.

06:26.803 --> 06:27.762

06:27.845 --> 06:32.433
I can melt that woman's heart
with a smile.

06:32.517 --> 06:36.062
And if that doesn't do it, I've
been working on a little dance.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.610

my Instagram?

06:42.693 --> 06:45.154
This morning,
it said I have ten followers.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.031

you only have nine.

06:47.115 --> 06:47.657
- What happened?

06:47.740 --> 06:49.158
How'd I lose a follower?

06:49.242 --> 06:53.955
- Sorry, honey, I got tired
of looking at clocks.

06:54.038 --> 06:57.083
- Well, this shot of the clock
in the surgeon's lounge

06:57.166 --> 06:58.000
is interesting.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.252

taking a little interest

06:59.335 --> 07:01.379
in your old man's photographs,
eh?

07:01.462 --> 07:05.424
- No, those are still
mind-numbingly boring.

07:05.508 --> 07:08.803
What interests me is the surgeon
looking at the clock.

07:08.886 --> 07:12.890
He's wearing scrubs
that says "smooth operator."

07:12.974 --> 07:16.394
- Funny thing is that guy
loses like a patient a week.

07:16.477 --> 07:19.605
- [laughs] The funny thing is
he's wearing funny scrubs, dad.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.065
You said they weren't allowed.

07:21.149 --> 07:22.275

Oh, right.

07:24.777 --> 07:26.654
Yes, no,
they fired him for that.

The guy who kills
52 patients a year

07:29.157 --> 07:32.952

07:33.035 --> 07:34.328

Then take a marker and draw
them on, no rule about that.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.872
and you ruin it
by making it important to you.

18:43.956 --> 18:44.706
- But, sweetie, I was
trying to support you

18:44.790 --> 18:45.999
and fighting the fight.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.710
- Then support me
when I stop fighting.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.421
It's not your place
to quadruple my detention.

18:51.505 --> 18:53.298
- [sighs]

18:53.382 --> 18:53.757
You're right.

18:53.841 --> 18:57.177
I got caught up.

18:57.261 --> 18:58.679
I'm sorry.

18:58.762 --> 19:04.059
Well, I guess you're not
gonna feel great about these.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.185
- My face?

19:05.269 --> 19:06.311
Change of clothes.

19:06.395 --> 19:11.817
And I look terrible
in those colors.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.026
- Well, it's a good thing
you had this talk

19:13.110 --> 19:15.946
before you passed
those out at school.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.906

19:21.952 --> 19:23.078
- All right, I'll give you
$5 each

19:23.161 --> 19:25.956
if you turn your shirts
inside out

19:26.039 --> 19:29.418
and pretend we've never met.

19:29.501 --> 19:30.252
- Stephanie,
why are you here again?

19:30.335 --> 19:33.422
And why is everyone
wearing my face?

19:33.505 --> 19:33.922
- Are they?

19:34.006 --> 19:36.758
Ha, that's weird.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.135
- You said
you were gonna drop this.

19:38.218 --> 19:39.261
Go home.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.430
- James, we're gonna
wear your face every day

19:41.513 --> 19:42.764
until we get what we want.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.892
We had no idea
how cool you were.

19:44.975 --> 19:47.185
- Go home and get more shirts.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.771
We have a movement to lead.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.773
- Phillips, what is going on?

19:51.857 --> 19:54.818
- We are united as one.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.028
And until you drop
that stupid dress code,

19:56.111 --> 19:59.281
we're gonna wear these shirts
every day.

19:59.364 --> 20:00.282
Right, people?

20:00.365 --> 20:02.117
- ALL: Yeah!

20:02.201 --> 20:03.368
- You know what?

20:03.452 --> 20:04.870
I will drop the dress code.

20:04.953 --> 20:05.829
- Really?

20:05.913 --> 20:07.247
- ALL: [cheering]

20:07.331 --> 20:08.582
- James.

20:08.665 --> 20:10.918
- Yeah, you look good when
you all wear the same thing.

20:11.001 --> 20:15.464
So starting next week,
full uniforms.

20:15.547 --> 20:16.298
- Stephanie!

20:16.381 --> 20:17.883
- Don't worry.

20:17.966 --> 20:18.967
We can fight this.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.135
- No, leave.

20:20.218 --> 20:21.428
Just pick me up at 3.

20:21.511 --> 20:22.304
- Four.

20:22.387 --> 20:25.140
You forgot, you have detention.

20:25.223 --> 20:27.309
Oh, wait, 4:30.

20:27.392 --> 20:28.894
I have a thing.
