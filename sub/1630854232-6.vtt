42:32.466 --> 42:33.676
- Aye?

42:33.759 --> 42:35.469
- You don't remember
our talk yesterday?

42:35.552 --> 42:37.429
About Morocco?
- Why would we be talking

42:37.513 --> 42:38.764
about bloody Morocco?

42:40.140 --> 42:44.478
What the fuck
did that woman do to me?

42:44.561 --> 42:46.981
Yeah, I'd better call her, eh?
- Yeah, you do that.

42:47.064 --> 42:49.608
And then there's something
we need to do.

42:49.692 --> 42:52.152

42:57.992 --> 43:00.411

- Hmm.

43:00.494 --> 43:01.996
No money.

43:02.079 --> 43:04.039
- No money?

43:04.123 --> 43:05.666
What the fuck?

43:05.749 --> 43:08.252
- You ever been
to the Hebrides?
