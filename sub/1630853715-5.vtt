00:13.470 --> 00:15.173
Guillermo!

of the abdomen

00:19.716 --> 00:21.252
of our dead friend
Colin Robinson

00:21.286 --> 00:23.390
has reached that wild age.

00:23.423 --> 00:25.027
-(Colin laughs)
-NANDOR: That's mine.
You'll take it off

00:25.060 --> 00:27.532
-this second.
-Catch me, catch me! (grunts)

00:27.566 --> 00:29.770
-He's a very active lad.
-(Colin laughs)
-It feels like weeks

00:29.803 --> 00:31.406
since I had
had a good day's slumber.

00:31.439 --> 00:34.312
Fucking little guy. (grunts)

00:34.345 --> 00:36.216
-This ruckus never seems to end.
-(Colin laughing)

00:36.249 --> 00:37.552
He's very loud, and unlike us,

00:37.586 --> 00:38.754
he does not sleep
during the day.

00:38.788 --> 00:40.792
Nor does he sleep
during the night.

00:40.825 --> 00:42.696
-When does he sleep?
-I don't think he does.
-(glass breaks)

00:42.729 --> 00:45.100
Never a dull moment
with that scalawag.

00:45.133 --> 00:47.639
-NADJA: I'm pretty sure
he must be part demon.
-LASZLO: Nonsense.

00:47.672 --> 00:49.408

-NANDOR: We tried to distract
him by buying him toys.
-(Nadja hisses)

00:58.159 --> 01:00.430
But he just breaks the toy
and plays with the box.

01:00.464 --> 01:02.802
Which he then sets on fire.

01:02.836 --> 01:04.338
LASZLO:
Ah, well, at least

01:04.372 --> 01:05.675
he's not showing signs
of being a bore

01:05.708 --> 01:07.278
or an energy vampire.

01:07.311 --> 01:08.714
He has a very curious

01:08.748 --> 01:10.083

-GUILLERMO: Colin, no!

01:10.117 --> 01:11.587
LASZLO:

We're doing a piece to camera.
As I was saying,

01:14.258 --> 01:16.162
he has a very inquisitive
and curious mind.

01:16.195 --> 01:18.701
That is just a very nice,
bullshitty way of saying that

01:18.734 --> 01:20.805
-if we leave him unsupervised
for even one moment...
-GUILLERMO: Colin, no! No!

01:20.838 --> 01:22.575
...he runs down
to the bloody flooded basement

01:22.609 --> 01:24.145

-(Colin laughs)
-Colin!
-LASZO: No,

01:29.322 --> 01:30.558
I think there's method
in his madness.

01:30.592 --> 01:31.827
-(thudding)
-What we're seeing

01:31.860 --> 01:33.229
are the early,
tentative explorations

01:33.263 --> 01:35.100
of maybe a sculptor

01:35.133 --> 01:37.104
-or an architect.
-Or a psychopath.

But he needs to go to school

02:20.558 --> 02:22.361
so he can burn off
some of this energy

02:22.394 --> 02:25.334
and learn structure and be
around normal kids his own age.

02:25.367 --> 02:26.904
-But he's not a normal kid.
-NADJA: Mm.

02:26.937 --> 02:29.241
He's a singer, he's a dancer,
he's an entertainer.

02:29.275 --> 02:30.545
-He's got the magic.

-Have you been to a school?
-I have.

02:35.722 --> 02:38.494
Actually, I happened
to go to public school

02:38.527 --> 02:39.896
when I was little,
and look at me.

02:39.930 --> 02:41.900
-I turned out fine.
-(Nadja and Laszlo laugh)

02:41.934 --> 02:43.303
LASZLO:
Great plan.

02:43.336 --> 02:44.773
Send Baby Colin Robinson
to a school,

02:44.806 --> 02:46.175
and he ends up like you.

02:46.209 --> 02:47.846
NANDOR:
I have been thinking.

02:47.879 --> 02:50.852
Perhaps the answer
is to send Baby Colin Robinson

02:50.885 --> 02:53.491
to a performing arts school

02:53.524 --> 02:56.262
where they just pretend
to learn reading and writing

02:56.295 --> 02:57.499
and math, but at least
they're out of the house

02:57.532 --> 02:59.603
for, like,
eight hours of the day.

03:00.705 --> 03:02.942
What's going on here, then?

03:02.976 --> 03:05.515
-Where?
-NADJA: Have you had a haircut?

03:05.548 --> 03:07.251
Why? Have you had a haircut?

03:07.284 --> 03:10.190
LASZLO:
Have you been watching
Star Trek?

03:11.927 --> 03:14.866
Let's not, uh,
focus on looking at me,

03:14.900 --> 03:16.369
okay,
and focus on the big issue,

03:16.402 --> 03:18.541
which is the Baby Colin,
correct?

03:18.574 --> 03:20.210
NADJA:
Okay. What if we send him

03:20.243 --> 03:22.515
to a very selective
private school so he doesn't

03:22.549 --> 03:23.718
have to worry
about rubbing shoulders

03:23.751 --> 03:25.420
with street tramps and dullards?

03:25.454 --> 03:27.391
No. We have plenty
of good public schools here,

03:27.424 --> 03:29.496
-and they're free.
-I thought you were doing
the accounting.

03:29.529 --> 03:31.399
Isn't the nightclub swimming
in the trillions?

03:31.432 --> 03:34.004
No, we need that money
to fix the house.

03:34.038 --> 03:36.510
And I wouldn't say "trillions."
No, definitely not.

03:36.543 --> 03:38.246
How much money
have we made this month?

03:38.279 --> 03:40.350
(inhales) Have to, like,
crunch the numbers.

03:40.383 --> 03:43.323
-Top of my head, I don't...
-Hold on a second. Nandor,

03:43.356 --> 03:45.427
-why don't you rub your genie?
-NANDOR: He is a djinn.

03:45.460 --> 03:47.398
LASZLO:
Well, whether he's a djinn
or not, give him a rub,

03:47.431 --> 03:49.368
make a wish and
we can clean this bullshit up.

03:49.402 --> 03:50.638
NANDOR:
Well, I cannot do that.

03:50.671 --> 03:51.774
-LASZLO: Why?
-Because I only have

03:51.807 --> 03:53.343
a very limited number of wishes,

03:53.376 --> 03:55.447
-and I cannot be wasting them.
-NADJA: Selfish.

03:55.480 --> 03:57.251
And anyway, I already asked him.

03:57.284 --> 04:01.593
-(Nadja gasps)
-And he said that
he is legally prohibited

04:01.627 --> 04:04.499
from doing any kind
of house stuff.

04:04.533 --> 04:05.868
Bummer.

04:05.902 --> 04:07.939
Of course I could ask the djinn

04:07.972 --> 04:10.277
to make all of our troubles
with the house disappear.

04:10.310 --> 04:13.049
But it's a very slippery slope.

04:13.082 --> 04:14.886
Are you sure
you haven't had a haircut?

04:14.920 --> 04:16.389
NANDOR:
First we fix the house.

04:16.422 --> 04:17.959
Then it's like, "Oh, Nandor,

04:17.992 --> 04:20.531
can you wish for a new rug?"
or some shit.

04:20.565 --> 04:22.836
And before you know it, all
of my wishes will be used up,

04:22.869 --> 04:26.275
and I will have no more wishes
left to make a global impact.

04:26.309 --> 04:29.014
Which is what I plan
on focusing on next:

04:29.048 --> 04:31.018
philanthropy.

04:31.052 --> 04:32.822
-(Djinn grunts)
-Hey.

04:32.856 --> 04:34.358
You rang?

04:34.391 --> 04:36.329
I did? Oh.

04:36.362 --> 04:38.032
It was an accident.

04:38.066 --> 04:40.505
So, uh, you are satisfied

04:40.538 --> 04:42.307
with the results
of your last wish?

04:42.341 --> 04:44.646
Would you excuse us
for just a moment?

04:44.679 --> 04:46.082
Philanthropy stuff.

04:46.115 --> 04:48.453
(whispers):
So, about my last wish.

04:48.486 --> 04:51.660
I think the removing
of the wrinkles around the eyes

04:51.693 --> 04:53.531
was a success, yes?

04:53.564 --> 04:55.000
I live to serve.

04:55.033 --> 04:57.806
Uh, however, I feel like
the smoothness of the skin

04:57.839 --> 04:59.976
is now drawing some attention

05:00.010 --> 05:02.414
to some bagginess
under the eyes.

05:02.447 --> 05:05.053
-Hmm. Come. Come, let me see?
-See here?

isn't such a bad idea

very tight with the headmaster.

that's a rather hasty decision?

and look how he's turned out.

And remember, you're
just a regular human being

regular human things.

07:20.524 --> 07:22.160
You are not a vampire,

07:22.194 --> 07:23.797
and if... Oh, no.

07:23.831 --> 07:26.670
Ta-da!

07:26.703 --> 07:28.507
Well...

07:28.540 --> 07:32.782

looking human aspect, but no.

The man of the hour,
Headmaster Warren.

08:03.944 --> 08:05.681
-NANDOR: Hi.
-(Nadja chuckles)
-SEAN (chuckles): Yeah.

08:05.715 --> 08:07.117
Now, back when I was in school,

08:07.150 --> 08:09.522
he was nothing
but a loser guidance counselor,

08:09.556 --> 08:11.192
but he really helped me

08:11.225 --> 08:14.164
set some more realistic goals
for college.

08:14.198 --> 08:15.801
A four-year program
isn't for everyone.

08:15.835 --> 08:19.208
But you turned out to be
a fine young man, Sean.

08:19.241 --> 08:21.813
-Talking of fine young men,
uh...
-WARREN: Oh!

08:21.847 --> 08:23.951
-And this must be Colin.
-LASZLO: Go on.

08:23.984 --> 08:25.588
Hello, young man.

08:25.621 --> 08:28.092
It's my pleasure
to make your acquaintance, sir.

08:28.126 --> 08:29.829
-And guess what?
-What's that?

08:29.863 --> 08:33.069
I'm a remarkable smart lad
who can sing and dance,

08:33.102 --> 08:35.608
and I never watch YouTube,

08:35.641 --> 08:37.678
-and I never pound holes
in the wall using a hammer.
-LASZLO: Ah!

08:37.712 --> 08:39.214
-Okay! (laughs)
-LASZLO: Off you go, Colin.

08:39.248 --> 08:40.885
I think we've had
enough of that.

08:40.918 --> 08:42.588
-It's your bedtime, I think.
-GUILLERMO: Please.

08:42.622 --> 08:44.693
-Please, take a seat.
-Oh, out of the mouths of babes.

08:44.726 --> 08:48.199
-NADJA: Oh, so human of him.
(chuckles)
-NANDOR: Yes.

08:48.232 --> 08:50.604
WARREN:
So, uh, my apologies

08:50.638 --> 08:51.840
for not being fully up to speed,

08:51.873 --> 08:55.113
but, uh,
who exactly are the parents?

08:55.146 --> 08:57.618
Uh...

08:57.652 --> 08:58.954
-LASZLO: Yeah.
-NADJA: Uh...

08:59.889 --> 09:02.027
When I click my fingers,

09:02.060 --> 09:04.264
you will enter
a trancelike state

09:04.298 --> 09:07.003
where you will hear nothing
or see nothing.

09:07.037 --> 09:09.108
I will then click my fingers
once more,

09:09.141 --> 09:11.145
and you will regain
consciousness,

09:11.178 --> 09:13.751
remembering nothing
of this pause.

09:13.784 --> 09:16.857
-(snaps fingers)
-We really should have figured
this out before they came.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.627
Who are we gonna say
the parents are?

09:18.660 --> 09:20.263
Let's just say that I'm the
mother and you are the father.

09:20.296 --> 09:22.134
-Good idea.
-LASZLO: That won't work,
my darling.

09:22.167 --> 09:24.138
-I've already told him
I'm the boy's uncle.
-Shit.

09:24.171 --> 09:26.108
Fine, I will be the father.

09:26.142 --> 09:27.645
-Looking like that?
-Yes.

09:27.678 --> 09:29.114
-Better than nothing.
-Well, look at him.

09:29.148 --> 09:30.885
-NADJA: Laszlo, get over it!
-LASZLO: Come on.

09:30.918 --> 09:32.889
-NADJA: Ouch! Nandor.
(clears throat)
-Sorry.

09:32.922 --> 09:34.024
-(snaps fingers)
-(laughs)

09:34.057 --> 09:35.995
Yes, hello.

09:36.028 --> 09:37.999
We are Colin's parents.
I am Nadja.

09:38.032 --> 09:39.869
I carried him to full term.

09:39.903 --> 09:42.809
Yes, and I am Matthew.

09:42.842 --> 09:45.614
Well, I'd love to ask you
a few questions

09:45.648 --> 09:47.685
-about yourselves and Colin.
-NANDOR: Mm.

09:47.718 --> 09:49.188
Yes, and we can answer
those questions

09:49.221 --> 09:51.325
because we are very much
Colin's parents.

09:51.358 --> 09:52.728
-(chuckles)
-NANDOR: Yes.

09:52.762 --> 09:54.264
And I am Matthew.

09:54.298 --> 09:55.801
Okay.

09:55.835 --> 09:58.005
-So, uh, let's get into it.
-(zipper rasps)

09:58.039 --> 10:00.878
How old is Colin?

10:00.911 --> 10:02.748
-Twelve.
-Forty-two.

10:02.782 --> 10:04.318
-Sixteen.
-One.

10:04.351 --> 10:05.955
-(whispers):
He's nine years old.
-Nine!

10:05.988 --> 10:07.792
-♪ He's nine. ♪
-Nine.

10:07.825 --> 10:09.629
Okay, great.
(chuckles)

10:09.662 --> 10:12.367
Is everybody going to be staying
for this next part, as well?

10:12.400 --> 10:14.071
I mean, usually,

10:14.104 --> 10:15.808
-it's only the...
-(snaps fingers)
-NADJA: I think

10:15.841 --> 10:17.377
he thinks it's weird that
it's not just me and Nandor.

10:17.410 --> 10:18.914
-Matthew.
-LASZLO: I think it's weird

10:18.947 --> 10:20.383
he wants you two alone
in a room.

10:20.416 --> 10:22.120
Well, if everyone's staying,
then I should stay, too.

10:22.154 --> 10:23.356
-You know, for human guidance.
-(Nadja groans)

10:23.389 --> 10:24.793
Fine. I will fix this.

10:24.826 --> 10:26.630
-(clears throat)
-(snaps fingers)

10:26.663 --> 10:28.934
-(Nadja chuckles)
-...uh, parents

10:28.967 --> 10:31.338
-who do the interview.
-NADJA: Good point, yes.

10:31.372 --> 10:33.777
But I would like to say
that we're all going to stay

10:33.811 --> 10:35.681
because we very much think
of everyone

10:35.714 --> 10:37.685
-in this room
as members of the family.
-NANDOR: Mm-hmm.

10:37.718 --> 10:39.722
So, please, meet our butler

10:39.756 --> 10:43.095
-and our groundskeeper.
-I'm the groundskeeper,
by the way. Ha!

10:43.129 --> 10:46.402
(chuckles): Okay, then.
One big, happy family.

10:46.435 --> 10:48.272
Everyone helps out here.

10:48.306 --> 10:51.111
-There's a lot of love
in this family.
-NANDOR: Mm.

10:51.145 --> 10:52.380
In fact, there's so much love,

10:52.414 --> 10:53.717
apparently,
you're with Nandor now

10:53.750 --> 10:55.220
and Laz doesn't mind?

10:55.253 --> 10:57.257
(chuckles): I mean,
you know, it's no judgment.

10:57.290 --> 10:58.961
What's the word
for what you guys are? It's...

10:58.994 --> 11:00.798
-Polyamorous?
-SEAN: Oh,

11:00.831 --> 11:02.100
I was thinking filthy hippies,

11:02.133 --> 11:03.837
but, uh, like I said,
no judgement.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.708
-Right, Mr. Warren?
-(snaps fingers)

11:05.741 --> 11:07.812
-NADJA: Fuck's sake.
-Of course this is a disaster.

11:07.845 --> 11:09.983
-He knows we're married,
my darling.
-NADJA: Let's just say

11:10.016 --> 11:11.953
that I am the mother
and Laszlo is the father.

11:11.987 --> 11:14.258
-Who am I going to be?
-You're the groundskeeper now.

11:14.291 --> 11:15.828
-Keep up.
-(Nandor groans)
-GUILLERMO: Come on.

11:15.861 --> 11:17.865
-Go, go, go, go, go. Careful.
-I can see.

11:17.899 --> 11:19.869
Careful, the camera. Stop. No.

11:19.903 --> 11:22.274
-Stop. Ready.
-Okay?

11:22.307 --> 11:24.746
-(snaps fingers)
-(Nadja laughs)

11:24.779 --> 11:27.250
WARREN:
So, uh...

11:27.284 --> 11:29.288
I'm sorry. Uh...
(chuckles)

11:29.321 --> 11:31.860
-Where was I?
-NANDOR: I don't know.

11:31.893 --> 11:34.966
I am just Matthew,
the groundskeeper.

11:40.778 --> 11:41.947
(Nadja crying)

11:41.980 --> 11:43.416
And there Colin was,

11:43.449 --> 11:45.821
just perched
on the top of the tree

11:45.854 --> 11:48.025
like a little snake.

11:48.059 --> 11:50.096
But not a snake.
(sniffles)

11:50.129 --> 11:51.432
A real human baby.

11:51.465 --> 11:54.371
Very normal human baby.

11:54.404 --> 11:55.975
And we had no choice

11:56.008 --> 11:59.147
but to, um, take him in, crying.

11:59.181 --> 12:00.851
That is very odd.

12:02.020 --> 12:03.523
-But really quite beautiful.
-NADJA: Yeah.

12:03.557 --> 12:04.792
WARREN:
We consider it a positive

12:04.826 --> 12:06.395
to support family structures

12:06.428 --> 12:09.034
that at one time
might have seemed unorthodox.

12:09.067 --> 12:11.740
In fact, I'd venture to say

12:11.773 --> 12:16.115
we have families
far less traditional than yours.

12:16.148 --> 12:18.787
-(snaps fingers)
-Shit.
We aren't different enough.

12:18.820 --> 12:20.456
We need
a weirder family structure.

12:20.490 --> 12:22.060
The more unorthodox we are,

12:22.093 --> 12:23.764
the more chance we have
of getting him in.

12:23.797 --> 12:25.400
No, I think we're doing fine
with the adoption angle.

12:25.433 --> 12:27.170
-We need to be gay.
-(Nadja gasps)

12:27.203 --> 12:29.842
No, there's plenty
of gay parents out there.

12:29.876 --> 12:31.813
Trust me. Gay is in.

12:31.846 --> 12:33.984
Gay is hot. I want some gay.

12:34.017 --> 12:35.888
Gay it's gonna be. Nandor?

12:35.921 --> 12:38.392
-(snaps fingers)
-As you can see,
we're Colin's two dads.

12:38.426 --> 12:42.067
Wonderful. You know,
our school is quite proud

12:42.100 --> 12:44.071
of our acceptance
of family structures

12:44.104 --> 12:46.241
-that at one time might...
-Yeah, can I stop you there?

12:46.275 --> 12:48.947
You need to know that we're
very gay for each other.

12:48.981 --> 12:50.216
NANDOR:
Completely gay.

12:50.249 --> 12:52.320
We are like
two French trombones.

12:52.354 --> 12:54.926
And this guy?
I ream him nightly.

12:54.959 --> 12:56.395
NANDOR:
And I'm always sucking him off.

12:56.428 --> 12:58.132
They are like,
"Come, it's dinner!

12:58.165 --> 13:00.136
Stop sucking off
your gay husband!"

13:00.169 --> 13:02.842
(chuckles) Which is amusing,
'cause I am dinner.

13:02.875 --> 13:05.146
-And I just carry on
reaming him.
-(whispering): Nadja. Nadja.

13:05.179 --> 13:07.350
Sexually.
You must understand that.

13:07.384 --> 13:10.323
Hey! You got a problem
with these guys being gay?

13:10.356 --> 13:11.993
-I will ream you.
-(normal voice): No.

13:12.027 --> 13:14.031
-No, I don't have a problem.
-SEAN: You better not.

13:14.064 --> 13:15.834
'Cause I don't mess
with homophobes.

13:15.868 --> 13:17.270
-It's the 20th century now.
-Thank you for that, Sean.

13:17.304 --> 13:19.141
-Well said.
-Please just freeze them. Okay?

13:19.174 --> 13:20.844
-Oh, for fuck's sake.
(snaps fingers)
-Appreciated.

13:20.878 --> 13:22.548
What'd you do that for?
That was going great.

13:22.581 --> 13:24.451
If you're gonna do this,
just hold hands and act normal.

13:24.484 --> 13:27.390
Stop talking about
your explicit sexual activities.

13:27.424 --> 13:29.094
-LASZLO: Why?
-Jealous.

13:29.127 --> 13:30.497
(snaps fingers)

13:30.531 --> 13:32.067
Y-Your relationship aside,

13:32.100 --> 13:34.204
could you tell me
a little bit about Colin?

13:34.237 --> 13:36.342
Oh, yes. Yes, they can.

13:36.375 --> 13:38.079
Yes.

13:38.112 --> 13:39.615
We can.

13:39.649 --> 13:42.153
LASZLO:
Yeah. Um, Colin is a...

13:42.187 --> 13:44.057
-NANDOR: Um...
-LASZLO: Yes.

13:44.091 --> 13:45.393
-Give us a minute.
-WARREN: Okay.

13:45.426 --> 13:47.163
Colin...

13:47.197 --> 13:49.401
-He...
-LASZLO: Colin...

13:49.434 --> 13:53.476
-Uh...
-Colin is a bright
and energetic boy

13:53.510 --> 13:55.013
who's eager to make friends.

13:55.046 --> 13:56.883
His favorite number is 31.

13:56.916 --> 13:58.452
His favorite color is brown,

13:58.486 --> 14:01.526
and he loves both classic stage
and movie musicals.

14:01.559 --> 14:05.166
-He's actually quite a gifted
singer and performer himself.
-WARREN: Wow.

14:05.199 --> 14:07.203
For a non-parental figure,

14:07.237 --> 14:09.474
-you sure seem to know
a lot about Colin.
-(Nadja snaps fingers)

14:09.509 --> 14:11.579
You bragging about all your
Colin Robinson knowledge

14:11.613 --> 14:13.449
is making all of us
look like skata.

14:13.482 --> 14:15.587
But no one was saying anything,
so I had to say something.

14:15.621 --> 14:17.457
Now he's going to think we're
those absentee parent types

14:17.490 --> 14:18.960
who know nothing
about their children

14:18.994 --> 14:20.463
and let the nanny
do all the work.

14:20.497 --> 14:23.002
-Yeah, well, you are.
-NADJA: Fine.

14:23.035 --> 14:25.139
You want to be king
of Baby Colin Robinson?

14:25.173 --> 14:27.343
-(Nadja snaps fingers)
-GUILLERMO: So,
has it been hard

14:27.377 --> 14:30.283
raising Colin alone by myself

14:30.316 --> 14:33.355
as a single parent? Yeah.

14:33.389 --> 14:34.892
Perhaps that's why
we're so close.

14:34.926 --> 14:37.531
We only have each other
in this cold,

14:37.565 --> 14:40.136
-scary world.
-NANDOR: Could I interest you
in some

14:40.169 --> 14:42.340
refreshments? Uh...

14:42.373 --> 14:43.677
Potato chips, some eggs,

14:43.710 --> 14:45.514
cigarette,
or perhaps a nice, ripe

14:45.547 --> 14:47.885
banana.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.557
WARREN:
Uh...

14:50.591 --> 14:52.628
-Did that upset you?
-I'm sorry, what?

14:52.661 --> 14:55.166
WARREN:
Well, you look a little, uh,
surprised, or maybe

14:55.199 --> 14:56.603
troubled by what

14:56.636 --> 14:58.105
-Guillermo just said.
-NANDOR: No.

14:58.139 --> 15:00.309
That's just... allergies.

15:00.343 --> 15:02.681
This is how I look
when I get my allergies.

15:02.715 --> 15:04.585
(stifled sneeze)

15:04.619 --> 15:06.455
WARREN:
You know, one of the parents
at our school is a

15:06.488 --> 15:08.927
top-notch allergist. I could
put you in touch with him.

15:08.960 --> 15:10.263
-Yes.
-WARREN: A very nice family.

15:10.296 --> 15:13.436
Uh, his wife
is a wonderful actress,

15:13.469 --> 15:15.974
but it wouldn't be appropriate
for me to mention her name.

15:16.008 --> 15:17.545
-Absolutely, no.
-SEAN: Oh, go ahead.

15:17.578 --> 15:19.014
-Tell us.
-No, no.
-(overlapping chatter)

15:19.047 --> 15:20.116
SEAN:
Come on.

15:20.149 --> 15:21.519
Let's just say that you would

15:21.553 --> 15:24.492
recognize her from...

15:24.525 --> 15:27.297
more than a few episodes
of Law & Order.

15:27.330 --> 15:28.967
Law & Order.
I was going to say...

15:29.000 --> 15:30.103
NADJA:
(snaps fingers) Okay.

15:30.136 --> 15:31.238
I know what's going on here.

15:31.271 --> 15:33.242
It's as clear as day.

15:33.275 --> 15:35.981
This motherfucker
is a starfucker.

15:36.014 --> 15:38.185
What? No, I don't think
that's what he meant.

15:38.219 --> 15:39.956
NADJA:
Yes, that is what
these schools want.

15:39.989 --> 15:41.593
They want the famous parents,
so they can be like,

15:43.997 --> 15:45.266

15:45.299 --> 15:47.070

15:47.103 --> 15:49.441

15:49.474 --> 15:52.715
Nadja's right. He fucks stars.

15:52.748 --> 15:54.384
Where can we find
a celebrity, and fast?

15:54.417 --> 15:56.121
LASZLO:
Well, this is Staten Island,

15:56.155 --> 15:59.729
which is a veritable playground
for the glitterati.

15:59.762 --> 16:02.133
(Nadja laughs)

16:02.167 --> 16:03.435
This way.

16:03.469 --> 16:05.507
So, yeah, as long as
it's SAG minimum,

16:05.541 --> 16:07.076
I'm down for anything.

16:07.110 --> 16:08.078
Who's this guy?

16:08.112 --> 16:10.116
Shut up. (clears throat)

16:10.149 --> 16:11.553
(laughs)

16:11.586 --> 16:13.623
It is actually very interesting
you say that

16:13.657 --> 16:16.161

Colin's father here, Mr...

16:16.195 --> 16:18.199
Sal Vulcano,

16:18.232 --> 16:20.704
is a very famous actor also.

16:20.737 --> 16:23.475
I wouldn't consider
what I do acting, but...

16:23.510 --> 16:25.413
LASZLO:
This is Colin's father,

16:25.446 --> 16:29.087
you know, the guy from
Incomprehensible Jesters.

16:29.120 --> 16:31.391
-Impractical Jokers...
-Nobody cares.

16:31.425 --> 16:33.095
Just sit there silent.

16:33.128 --> 16:35.266
So, Sal here is Colin's father?

16:35.299 --> 16:36.335
-NADJA: Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

16:36.368 --> 16:38.239
Or...

16:38.272 --> 16:41.011
(chuckles) I'm sorry,
it's been a long day,

16:41.044 --> 16:43.048
and my memory
isn't what it once was.

16:43.082 --> 16:44.384
(laughter)

16:44.417 --> 16:47.023
Whoa. Who the hell is that guy?

16:48.727 --> 16:51.566
-It is me, Nandor.
-SEAN: Oh, no, no.

16:51.599 --> 16:53.035
You're not Nandor.

16:53.068 --> 16:54.539
Okay, fine, fine,
I am not Nandor.

16:54.572 --> 16:56.776
I am... Adolfo,

16:56.809 --> 16:58.412
the butler or some shit.

16:58.445 --> 17:00.182
-Yeah, all right.
-Right.

17:00.216 --> 17:03.355
So... who exactly
are the parents here?

17:03.389 --> 17:05.627
-(laughs) Shit.
-(snaps fingers)

17:05.661 --> 17:08.600
Uh... I'm not sure I get
the joke of the bit.

17:08.633 --> 17:11.104
-(neck cracks)
-(grunts) Laszlo!

17:11.138 --> 17:12.440
-(muffled scream)
-Woops.

17:12.473 --> 17:13.442
LASZLO:
Prick was getting on my nerves

17:13.475 --> 17:14.444
with his jibber-jabber.

17:14.477 --> 17:16.181
We'll drain him later.

17:16.215 --> 17:17.718
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
If you can hypnotize them

17:17.751 --> 17:19.555
for them to freeze
and forget everything,

17:19.589 --> 17:21.559
wouldn't it be easier to just
hypnotize Headmaster Warren

17:21.593 --> 17:23.195
into allowing Colin

17:23.229 --> 17:25.433
into the school
without all this play-acting?

17:25.466 --> 17:27.437
Did this bitch

17:27.470 --> 17:28.840
just say what I think he said?

17:28.873 --> 17:30.777
-He did.
-Are you off your tits, boy?

17:30.811 --> 17:32.848
-What?
-NANDOR: He is.
-NADJA: Exactly.

17:32.881 --> 17:34.752
We are in far too deep
now, baby.

17:34.785 --> 17:36.321
The only way forward

17:36.355 --> 17:38.660
is to stick to the plan.

17:39.261 --> 17:41.733
NADJA:
Little Colin has
so many hobbies,

17:41.766 --> 17:43.570
it's just very hard
to keep track.

17:43.603 --> 17:46.208
Yeah, he definitely loves
his big little head, you know?

17:46.241 --> 17:47.645
It's always bobbling all around.

17:47.678 --> 17:49.649
-Like yours, honey.
-(laughs)

17:49.682 --> 17:51.786
This one and that one,
they're all bobbling.

17:52.554 --> 17:54.492
DOLL NADJA:
The pain of childbirth
is nothing

17:54.525 --> 17:56.428
compared to the pain
of child rearing.

17:56.461 --> 17:58.132
That's beautifully said.

17:58.165 --> 18:00.504
It's definitely not easy
being a single mother,

18:00.537 --> 18:03.108
but I love Baby Colin, my son.

18:03.142 --> 18:06.214
What the actual fuck is that?
Is that a talking doll?

18:07.651 --> 18:09.454
So, um, please to tell me
a little bit

18:09.487 --> 18:11.158
about Colin's hobbies?

18:11.191 --> 18:12.327
Who is Colin?

18:12.360 --> 18:15.232
Colin is our son, my darling.

18:15.734 --> 18:17.437
LASZLO:
Just to be clear, old-timer,

18:17.470 --> 18:19.307
I'm not always the sucker,
and he's

18:19.341 --> 18:20.510
not always the reamer.

18:20.544 --> 18:22.146
Though, he does ream me nightly.

18:22.180 --> 18:24.451
Adolfo, you dirty dog.

18:24.484 --> 18:26.889
Wait a second, haven't we
already done this one?

18:26.923 --> 18:28.793
Hello.

18:31.499 --> 18:32.835
-LASZLO: Seany!
-OTHERS: Hey!

18:32.868 --> 18:34.237
Yo, Lasz.

18:34.270 --> 18:36.408
(skunk chittering)

18:36.441 --> 18:38.747
You know what?
I'm not doing this.

18:38.780 --> 18:40.116
-(Laszlo sighs)
-GUILLERMO: Baby.

18:41.686 --> 18:44.725
I'm sorry to cut this short,
but my head is killing me.

18:44.759 --> 18:47.598
Oh, you, too? I got, like,
the mother of all migraines.

18:47.631 --> 18:49.134
-(chuckles)
-WARREN: Anyway, it's been

18:49.167 --> 18:51.706
a most informative evening.
(chuckles)

18:51.739 --> 18:53.643
So, uh, do you have
Colin's transcripts?

18:53.677 --> 18:56.683
What? (stammers) What's that?

18:56.716 --> 18:59.254
His transcripts
from his previous school.

18:59.287 --> 19:01.224
-He's never been to school...
-I'll have them
sent over tomorrow.

19:06.669 --> 19:08.540
GUILLERMO: So, yeah,
I pulled a few strings to get

19:08.573 --> 19:11.211
the guidance counselor
from my old school to work up

19:11.244 --> 19:12.715
a fake transcript
for Baby Colin.

19:12.748 --> 19:14.351
You know, not really happy
about dipping

19:14.384 --> 19:15.821
into the nightclub fund for it,

19:15.854 --> 19:17.390
or the whole bribery thing
in general,

19:17.423 --> 19:18.760
but it's what's best
for the child.

19:18.793 --> 19:21.566
Anyways, uh, I'm gonna go
for a little walk,

19:21.599 --> 19:24.471
and I'll catch you guys
back at the house, okay?

19:30.751 --> 19:33.556
(car beeps)

19:33.590 --> 19:35.660

19:36.796 --> 19:38.465

19:38.500 --> 19:40.570
(speaking Spanish)

19:46.682 --> 19:48.352
You take care of that,
all right?

19:48.385 --> 19:50.590
(speaking Spanish)

19:58.472 --> 20:01.311
Hey, guys.

20:01.344 --> 20:03.583
Uh, what's up? (laughs)

20:03.616 --> 20:06.388
I thought we wrapped for me,
I was wrapped for the day.

20:06.421 --> 20:08.258
This isn't what it looks like.

20:08.292 --> 20:10.362
I mean, sure, yes,
I've had, you know,

20:10.396 --> 20:11.866
access to more cash lately,

20:11.899 --> 20:13.803
ever since I became
the bookkeeper for the club,

20:13.837 --> 20:15.406
but...

20:16.809 --> 20:18.713
I know I shouldn't be stealing

20:18.747 --> 20:20.282
from the club,
and I'm not stealing.

20:20.316 --> 20:21.451
I was just putting
some cash aside

20:21.485 --> 20:22.921
to pay myself.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.324
It's not even about me.

20:24.357 --> 20:25.727
It's about family, okay?

20:25.761 --> 20:27.898
I just happen to have
two families

20:27.931 --> 20:29.535
I got to take care of, huh?

20:29.568 --> 20:31.004
Just like you have a family.

20:31.037 --> 20:33.409
No?

20:33.442 --> 20:35.647
I'll put it right there.

20:39.020 --> 20:40.456
No takers?

20:40.489 --> 20:42.026
LASZLO:
Pick it up, lad!

20:42.059 --> 20:43.563
That's it.

20:43.596 --> 20:45.032
-Come on. Baby!
-NANDOR: Power through.

20:45.065 --> 20:47.403
-Oh!
-This is embarrassing.

20:47.437 --> 20:49.441
These kids need to watch
some more Dream Team footage

20:49.474 --> 20:50.744
and then play like that.

20:50.777 --> 20:52.046
-Shut up bitching.
-(hisses)

20:52.079 --> 20:53.683
LASZLO:
He's doing a marvelous job.

20:53.716 --> 20:54.785
NADJA:
Well, after all our hard work,

20:54.819 --> 20:56.622
Baby Colin did not get accepted.

20:56.656 --> 20:59.662
Apparently, Headmaster Warren
suffered a massive stroke

20:59.695 --> 21:01.532
only hours
after meeting up with us.

21:01.566 --> 21:03.402
The reason for that is
most human beings

21:03.435 --> 21:05.540
can only take
seven hypnoses per hour.

21:05.574 --> 21:08.412
That man went through 428.

21:08.445 --> 21:10.416
So we didn't have to start
all over again,

21:10.449 --> 21:12.386
we decided to enroll Baby Colin

21:12.420 --> 21:14.357
in every community sports league

21:14.390 --> 21:15.459
we could think of.

21:15.494 --> 21:17.063
The volleyballs, softballs...

21:17.096 --> 21:19.300
-LASZLO: And large balls.
-NADJA: Baseballs,

21:19.334 --> 21:20.369
sports balls...

21:20.402 --> 21:22.340
Human stuff.

21:22.373 --> 21:23.977
They're obsessed with balls.

21:24.010 --> 21:26.047
Kill them! Kill them dead!

21:26.081 --> 21:29.688
-Don't you think we might be
pushing him a little too hard?
-No.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.492
This is essential
for his college application.

21:31.526 --> 21:32.928
Plus, he's having a great time.

21:32.961 --> 21:35.366
NANDOR:
Put it in the basket!

21:35.399 --> 21:36.669
(cheering)

21:36.702 --> 21:38.438
That's my boy!

21:38.472 --> 21:40.309

-LASZLO: Time for hockey.

21:40.342 --> 21:41.411
Okay.

21:42.915 --> 21:44.919
NADJA:
And now, finally, the boy's

21:44.952 --> 21:47.691
too tired
to be such a little shit.

21:50.497 --> 21:52.701
NANDOR:
So, ultimately, I realized

21:52.734 --> 21:55.774
I have been completely
ruining my life

21:55.807 --> 21:56.776
and my face.

21:56.809 --> 21:58.847
What is ironical is that

21:58.880 --> 22:00.817
I was only doing this
to make myself

22:00.851 --> 22:02.988
look better for my wife Marwa.

22:03.021 --> 22:05.459
This was for her, not for me.

22:05.494 --> 22:07.063
So, back to one?

22:07.096 --> 22:08.432
NANDOR:
Yes,

22:08.465 --> 22:10.402

22:10.436 --> 22:11.572
