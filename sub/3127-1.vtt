Hey, Michelle, do you know how
to make a hard-boiled egg?

01:42.240 --> 01:45.305
Boil it until it's hard?

Yeah, honey.

Let's play some ping pong!

21:56.400 --> 21:57.799
I haven't played in a while

21:57.800 --> 21:58.959
so take it easy on me, okay?

21:58.960 --> 22:00.705
Okay.

22:03.440 --> 22:04.787
Whoops.

22:21.840 --> 22:25.199
Well, what do we have over there?

22:25.200 --> 22:29.199
Shht. "Houston, two dildos
have snuck into the cabin

22:29.200 --> 22:31.741
and now we're headed
straight for Uranus!"

22:33.360 --> 22:35.389
Come on, let's just keep playing.

22:52.040 --> 22:53.719
Where've you been?

22:53.720 --> 22:55.479
Where you're not.

22:55.480 --> 22:56.879
What's your problem?

22:56.880 --> 22:58.999
Get off me, perv.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.199
Not until you tell me
what your problem is.

23:00.200 --> 23:01.519
I don't have a problem!

23:01.520 --> 23:03.199
Yes, you do.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.183
Step off her!

23:12.960 --> 23:15.599
"Step off her?"

23:15.600 --> 23:17.159
I can step on her

23:17.160 --> 23:21.465
whenever I want, "bro."

23:22.800 --> 23:24.759
Where's your stupid space pants?

23:24.760 --> 23:26.439
He must've left them at the deli,

23:26.440 --> 23:29.079
with the rest of the
bologna and cheese!

23:29.080 --> 23:31.359
What should I do
to this little guy?

23:31.360 --> 23:33.839
Crush his nads off!

23:33.840 --> 23:37.079
This is my table... renter.

23:37.080 --> 23:41.749
Go play that pancake
paddleball somewhere else.

23:45.160 --> 23:48.119
The Fun Hub is for serious
ping pong players,

23:48.120 --> 23:52.479
not dork wannabes.

23:52.480 --> 23:54.305
He's gimungous.

24:11.640 --> 24:13.319
Who are those two jerks?

24:13.320 --> 24:14.799
Lyle Ace and Dale Lyons,

24:14.800 --> 24:16.959
the richest kids in Ocean City.

24:16.960 --> 24:18.599
Are they a couple?

24:18.600 --> 24:20.599
No, they're just friends.

24:20.600 --> 24:21.999
I meant Lyle and Stacy.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.239
Pshh, they might as well be.

24:24.240 --> 24:26.239
What's wrong with her?

24:26.240 --> 24:28.079
You see that Icee cup she's
always got in her hand, Rad?

24:28.080 --> 24:29.959
Well, that's not an
Icee she's drinking.

24:29.960 --> 24:31.479
It's Funk Punch.

24:31.480 --> 24:33.039
What's Funk Punch?

24:33.040 --> 24:35.959
Funk Punch is when you combine an
Icee with Pop Rocks and Pixie Stix

24:35.960 --> 24:39.359
and sometimes even cocaine
and drink it really fast.

24:39.360 --> 24:41.319
She's a Funk Punch junkie.

24:41.320 --> 24:43.559
But she's so fly.

24:43.560 --> 24:45.719
Are we going to see my
dad's big boombox or not?

24:45.720 --> 24:47.839
I thought that's
what we were doing.

24:54.880 --> 24:56.679
Sounds like him
and his girlfriend Amber

24:56.680 --> 24:58.399
are playing board games again.

24:58.400 --> 24:59.719
I try not to bother
them when they do that.

24:59.720 --> 25:01.599
They get so competitive!

25:01.600 --> 25:03.759
Let's just go to the boardwalk
and play Skee-ball.

25:03.760 --> 25:07.223
I can't. I have to go to
dinner again with my family.

25:11.320 --> 25:13.799
"Our son almost torched
his face off with an egg.

25:13.800 --> 25:15.839
Let's buy him a present!"

25:15.840 --> 25:18.119
- Will you just pipe down, missy!
- Those aren't a present.

25:18.120 --> 25:20.279
If I slice my finger
off with a can opener,

25:20.280 --> 25:22.239
will you guys buy me a car?

25:22.240 --> 25:24.759
- How about you don't come to dinner with us?
- Honey.

25:24.760 --> 25:26.359
How about I would rather not?

25:26.360 --> 25:28.359
Why can't I wear what I'm wearing?

25:28.360 --> 25:30.159
You can't wear a
T-shirt and sneakers

25:30.160 --> 25:31.879
to the Paul Revere Smorgasbord!

25:31.880 --> 25:33.959
Don't move.

25:36.120 --> 25:39.239
Aww, that made a right bloody mess.

25:39.240 --> 25:42.359
- Squashed it all over, look at that.
- Hon!

25:42.360 --> 25:45.839
You wouldn't have thought it'd have
so much blood in it, would you?

26:18.880 --> 26:20.559
Girls really dig dorks

26:20.560 --> 26:23.639
who wear church clothes
to the boardwalk.

26:23.640 --> 26:25.799
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.799
What are you playing at?

26:27.800 --> 26:29.679
Go on, get out of here! You
can find your own dinner.

26:29.680 --> 26:30.999
Good!

26:31.000 --> 26:34.399
And be back home by 10:30 or the front
door will be locked until the morning!

26:34.400 --> 26:36.384
Ooh, scary threat!

26:38.960 --> 26:40.319
Brendan!

26:40.320 --> 26:42.119
I had enough!

26:42.120 --> 26:43.919
What is she going to eat?

26:43.920 --> 26:45.904
What was that for?

27:58.080 --> 28:00.319
- Brendan!
- What?

28:00.320 --> 28:02.119
I'm just getting started.

28:02.120 --> 28:03.879
You got to get your money's worth.

28:03.880 --> 28:06.039
What about the vegetables?

28:06.040 --> 28:07.479
I can get vegetables in
our backyard, Kendall.

28:07.480 --> 28:10.119
I've never seen any clam strips
growing in our garden, have you?

28:10.120 --> 28:11.679
Nope!

28:11.680 --> 28:13.119
Nope.

28:13.120 --> 28:16.479
Okay, that's enough, you two.

28:31.160 --> 28:34.639
Ooh. Aah.

29:09.880 --> 29:12.239
Okay, first there's the bass.

29:12.240 --> 29:14.319
And then there's the snare..

29:14.320 --> 29:15.959
So you guys try it.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.869
Hey, check this out!

29:31.080 --> 29:32.199
What is that?

29:32.200 --> 29:34.229
It's a tongue worm!

29:37.320 --> 29:39.279
Okay, I'm going to keep a beat.

30:01.520 --> 30:03.039
What are you even doing?

30:05.480 --> 30:06.519
Hey, Brad.

30:06.520 --> 30:08.759
It's Rad.

30:08.760 --> 30:10.479
Hey, Brad.

30:10.480 --> 30:12.639
Do you want to play
a game of ping pong?

30:12.640 --> 30:14.639
No, really. Just one game.

30:14.640 --> 30:17.181
I heard you're really good.

30:26.440 --> 30:27.787
Let's just go.

30:32.160 --> 30:34.599
This should be close!

30:34.600 --> 30:36.279
Can we not do this right now?

30:36.280 --> 30:38.469
Yes, we can do this right now.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.519
Hey, I have an idea.

30:41.520 --> 30:44.300
Let's not warm up.
Let's just volley.

30:45.920 --> 30:47.039
"P"...

30:47.040 --> 30:48.119
"I"...

30:48.120 --> 30:49.239
"N"...

30:49.240 --> 30:50.746
"G."

30:51.960 --> 30:53.421
Aww, yeah!

30:55.440 --> 30:57.079
My serve.

30:57.080 --> 31:00.559
Hey, I just remembered, me and Rad
have to be somewhere very important!

31:00.560 --> 31:06.822
Shut up, you black sissy.

31:12.520 --> 31:14.231
Ready?

31:18.720 --> 31:20.863
One serving zero.

31:25.680 --> 31:29.063
Two serving zero.

31:31.240 --> 31:34.111
Three serving zero.

31:36.920 --> 31:38.949
Four serving zero.

31:42.040 --> 31:44.559
Yeah!

31:44.560 --> 31:46.862
Zero serving five.

31:53.800 --> 31:56.228
Zero serving six.

31:58.400 --> 32:00.384
Zero serving seven.

32:03.840 --> 32:05.107
Yes, Lyle!

32:07.400 --> 32:10.319
Zero serving eight.

32:11.840 --> 32:13.301
You're really good.

32:14.720 --> 32:16.749
Zero serving nine!

32:23.760 --> 32:25.959
Rad, forget it! Let's just go home!

32:25.960 --> 32:27.750
Play him some other time.

32:29.440 --> 32:31.079
Rad, no!

32:31.080 --> 32:33.759
Would you shut your greasy head up!

32:33.760 --> 32:35.639
Teddy, I'm sorry.

32:35.640 --> 32:38.399
Sorry only counts in church!

32:38.400 --> 32:39.747
Teddy, wait!

32:42.480 --> 32:44.559
Are you done flirting
with your lover now?

32:44.560 --> 32:48.159
You do realize this is game point?

32:48.160 --> 32:49.791
Inseminate him.

32:58.760 --> 33:01.279
Yeah!

33:01.280 --> 33:03.105
Yes, Lyle!

33:07.960 --> 33:10.501
Smells like skunk in here.

33:23.760 --> 33:25.107
What's up?

33:39.440 --> 33:41.504
That was totally bogus.

33:42.840 --> 33:44.471
I know what you need.

33:46.640 --> 33:49.039
Listen, don't pay any
attention to Lyle.

33:49.040 --> 33:50.959
He thinks he, like, owns Ocean City

33:50.960 --> 33:52.919
just because he drives an
IROC and is super rich

33:52.920 --> 33:55.079
and totally hot and
ridiculously talented

33:55.080 --> 33:57.879
at everything he ever does.

33:57.880 --> 33:59.830
That's really yellow.

34:01.200 --> 34:03.439
Cheese makes everything better.

34:03.440 --> 34:05.639
Sugar makes it the best, though.

34:05.640 --> 34:10.103
Shooooooo-gerrrr.

34:15.840 --> 34:18.918
Why do girls date guys like Lyle?

34:18.920 --> 34:22.759
Because they're dumb.

34:22.760 --> 34:25.239
You don't seem dumb to me.

34:25.239 --> 34:28.020
Yeah, well, you don't know me.

34:33.080 --> 34:36.159
Do you "smort" cocaine?

34:36.159 --> 34:37.879
Do I "snort" cocaine?

34:37.880 --> 34:39.239
Yeah.

34:39.239 --> 34:41.399
Why? Who told you that?

34:41.400 --> 34:43.599
I mean, I've heard
some things, but...

34:43.600 --> 34:44.958
Well, you know what's worse

34:44.960 --> 34:46.518
than people who do cocaine?

34:46.520 --> 34:47.799
What?

34:47.800 --> 34:49.958
People who don't do cocaine

34:49.960 --> 34:53.799
but who gossip about people who
might or might not do cocaine!

34:53.800 --> 34:55.750
I have to go to the bathroom.

36:00.840 --> 36:03.239
What's up, space dork?

36:03.240 --> 36:05.319
I heard from a little birdy

36:05.320 --> 36:07.399
that after we left the Fun Hub,

36:07.400 --> 36:10.719
you were eating crab
au gratin with Stacy.

36:10.720 --> 36:12.559
But that couldn't
have been you, right?

36:12.560 --> 36:16.399
I mean, she only
dates white people.

36:20.640 --> 36:21.759
Give it back.

36:21.760 --> 36:24.359
What, this?

36:24.360 --> 36:26.279
I mean, I'm thirsty.

36:26.280 --> 36:27.919
Milk does a body good, right?

36:27.920 --> 36:30.439
It does your body good!

36:30.440 --> 36:32.479
- Stop, Lyle.
- "Stop, Lyle."

36:34.560 --> 36:37.879
You know, you do look
pretty dehydrated.

36:37.880 --> 36:40.359
Awww, gross!

36:40.360 --> 36:42.344
Back off!

36:44.560 --> 36:47.519
No way. The Town
Weirdo is your mom?

36:51.880 --> 36:54.069
Or are you his grandmom?

37:02.400 --> 37:05.021
I think you might
want to leave, buddy.

37:14.600 --> 37:17.949
"Thank you so much for
protecting me, Weird Mommy!"

37:36.960 --> 37:38.479
Thank you.

37:38.480 --> 37:40.519
Put on your khakis.

37:40.520 --> 37:43.959
We're going to your Aunt Peggy
and Uncle Jim's for dinner.

37:43.960 --> 37:45.679
What happened to you, Radford?

37:45.680 --> 37:47.519
Nothing.

37:47.520 --> 37:49.424
I got hot and thirsty.

37:59.440 --> 38:01.239
Do we have to stay long?

38:01.240 --> 38:02.559
Just a while.

38:02.560 --> 38:04.439
They're so creepy.

38:04.440 --> 38:09.239
Why do we always
have to visit them?

38:09.240 --> 38:11.799
Your sister is weird and
her husband is gross.

38:11.800 --> 38:13.199
Hey, Jim!

38:13.200 --> 38:17.119
Ha! Oh, look at that.

38:17.120 --> 38:21.119
The Miracles have la-la-landed.

38:21.120 --> 38:24.159
Let me look at you.
Hey there, sweetheart.

38:24.160 --> 38:26.359
- Hi, Jim.
- Aww, give me a big kiss.

38:26.360 --> 38:29.199
- Oh...
- Mmm.

38:29.200 --> 38:31.039
So beautiful.

38:31.040 --> 38:33.639
Hey there, Miss Vampire.
You need some Vitamin D.

38:33.640 --> 38:35.439
Mmm.

38:35.440 --> 38:37.159
And hey there, sir.

38:37.160 --> 38:38.999
Look at you, you're all grown up.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.399
Maybe not physically, but
you're aging. Right?

38:42.400 --> 38:45.319
You got to let me
in on your secret.

38:45.320 --> 38:47.719
How do you stay looking so young?

38:47.720 --> 38:49.279
I don't know.

38:49.280 --> 38:50.679
Alright, we'll talk
about it, alright?

38:50.680 --> 38:52.319
- Brendan.
- How are you, Jim?

38:52.320 --> 38:54.599
How are you? Welcome
to the beach, sir.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.039
- Welcome!
- Well, what do you looksie!

38:56.040 --> 38:58.519
Aww, there she is.

38:58.520 --> 39:00.999
Hey, sis.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.199
- Peggy, hi!
- You look great!

39:03.200 --> 39:05.239
Mm-hm.

39:05.240 --> 39:07.269
Aww, Brendan.

39:09.960 --> 39:12.839
Ha-ha! That's a kiss.

39:12.840 --> 39:13.959
Yeah.

39:13.960 --> 39:15.599
Mm!

39:15.600 --> 39:17.839
Uh, what happened to you?

39:17.840 --> 39:19.839
Why, you could use
a blood transfusion.

39:19.840 --> 39:21.639
Good to see you, Michelle!

39:21.640 --> 39:24.199
- That's what I said.
- Mister Man.

39:24.200 --> 39:26.239
- Come on!
- Sweet.

39:26.240 --> 39:27.799
- Crab time.
- Well, let's get some crabs!

39:27.800 --> 39:29.101
Mmm!

39:33.160 --> 39:35.239
When did you catch those crabs?

39:35.240 --> 39:37.159
Yesterday, I emptied
the traps yesterday.

39:37.160 --> 39:38.879
Yesterday?
Yes.

39:38.880 --> 39:40.439
Why aren't you eating any crabs?

39:40.440 --> 39:41.559
I'm a vegetarian.

39:41.560 --> 39:42.719
What?

39:42.720 --> 39:43.839
You're what?

39:43.840 --> 39:45.559
Meat is murder.

39:45.560 --> 39:47.359
I'm never eating
another animal again.

39:47.360 --> 39:49.119
But crabs aren't animals.

39:49.120 --> 39:51.229
Well, then what are they?

39:52.800 --> 39:54.479
They're crabs, right?

39:54.480 --> 39:56.559
- Right. Exactly.
- Right.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.919
So, what have you guys been up to?

39:58.920 --> 40:02.599
We haven't been doing a whole heck of
a lot, to tell you the truth, Peggy.

40:02.600 --> 40:04.239
Isn't that what summer
vacation's all about, right?

40:04.240 --> 40:06.079
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

40:06.080 --> 40:08.039
I hope you guys are sunning
yourselves properly.

40:08.040 --> 40:10.359
Because if you want to get,
you know, full coverage,

40:10.360 --> 40:13.159
you want to position yourself so you
want to get the inside of your thigh

40:13.160 --> 40:14.879
and the back of your leg
at the same time, right?

40:14.880 --> 40:16.759
You don't want any tan lines.

40:16.760 --> 40:18.759
You don't just lay flat.
You got to work it.

40:18.760 --> 40:20.599
That's why I have full coverage.

40:20.600 --> 40:22.265
You are so sexy, sweetheart.

40:24.120 --> 40:26.279
Redford made a new
friend named Teddy

40:26.280 --> 40:29.079
and they've been playing
ping pong every afternoon

40:29.080 --> 40:30.719
at the Fun Hub.

40:30.720 --> 40:32.879
- What?
- What?

40:32.880 --> 40:34.799
They've been doing what?

40:34.800 --> 40:36.439
Playing ping pong.

40:36.440 --> 40:38.399
It's like tennis, only smaller.

40:38.400 --> 40:41.119
I believe the real name
is "table tennis."

40:41.120 --> 40:43.999
Oh, I know what frigging
table tennis is, okay?

40:44.000 --> 40:46.239
What I don't get

40:46.240 --> 40:48.799
is why you play an indoor hobby

40:48.800 --> 40:50.479
when you're at the beach.

40:50.480 --> 40:52.439
What's the matter, Rad?

40:52.440 --> 40:56.119
Ocean not good enough for you?

40:56.120 --> 40:57.919
We've been going to the ocean.

40:57.920 --> 41:00.039
It's just, I don't want
to get too much sun.

41:00.040 --> 41:05.119
There is no such thing
as too much sun.

41:05.120 --> 41:07.639
You just need the right lotion.

41:10.480 --> 41:12.430
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

41:17.360 --> 41:20.759
This is from my "Horny
Shell" series, right here.

41:20.760 --> 41:22.479
They take some time
to get just right,

41:22.480 --> 41:25.399
but like most great
art, it is worth it.

41:25.400 --> 41:27.319
You actually sell these things?

41:27.320 --> 41:30.039
- Oh, yeah. They do real good up in Rehobeth.
- Huh.

41:30.040 --> 41:32.639
It's still a little wet at the tip.

41:32.640 --> 41:35.519
And you got the short-and-
curlies around the bottom.

41:35.520 --> 41:38.079
You guys really sleep out here?

41:38.080 --> 41:39.999
I do every night.

41:40.000 --> 41:43.999
Peggy, sometimes she joins
me from time to time.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.719
Obviously, you know, the
mattress that we have inside

41:46.720 --> 41:49.039
is for other things.

41:49.040 --> 41:52.519
You know, the moon provides
a complimentary shade

41:52.520 --> 41:56.999
to, you know, your otherwise
natural daytime tanning base.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.919
If you'll notice,

41:58.920 --> 42:00.839
I have a kind of a blue sheen,

42:00.840 --> 42:03.759
that nobody else has. You know.

42:03.760 --> 42:06.399
Don't you get bit by mosquitoes?

42:06.400 --> 42:08.543
Uh-uh.

42:10.880 --> 42:12.591
They can't get in.

42:16.760 --> 42:20.223
Can we go home now?
I don't feel good.

42:29.160 --> 42:31.839
Redford made a new
friend named Teddy.

42:31.840 --> 42:33.959
They've been doing what?

42:33.960 --> 42:37.919
Would you shut your greasy head up!

42:37.920 --> 42:40.039
Sorry only counts in church!

42:40.040 --> 42:43.503
Would you shut your greasy head up!

43:03.520 --> 43:05.159
Is Teddy here?

43:05.160 --> 43:07.599
No.

43:07.600 --> 43:08.959
Do you know where he is?

43:08.960 --> 43:10.759
No.

43:10.760 --> 43:12.519
Do you know when he's
going to be back?

43:12.520 --> 43:14.231
No.

43:29.280 --> 43:32.959
What's up.

43:32.960 --> 43:35.679
I'm really sorry
about the other day.

43:35.680 --> 43:37.239
Sure.

43:37.240 --> 43:39.119
That was the meanest thing

43:39.120 --> 43:43.919
I've ever said to anybody
in my whole entire life.

43:43.920 --> 43:45.631
I didn't mean it.

43:52.920 --> 43:55.188
Your hair is crazy fly.

45:31.040 --> 45:32.759
So, Teddy, where are you from?

45:32.760 --> 45:34.799
Baltimore.

45:34.800 --> 45:36.199
You like it there?

45:36.200 --> 45:38.559
It's as good a place as any.

45:38.560 --> 45:41.319
What's your favorite thing to do
when you're here in Ocean City?

45:41.320 --> 45:42.639
Hang out at Fun Hub.

45:42.640 --> 45:44.119
What's at Fun Hub?

45:44.120 --> 45:46.199
Everything. It's bad!

45:46.200 --> 45:49.839
Well, why would you
go there if it's bad?

45:49.840 --> 45:52.759
Dad, bad means good.

45:52.760 --> 45:56.319
Well, then why wouldn't
you just say good?

45:56.320 --> 45:58.509
You kids try too hard.

46:21.600 --> 46:23.639
What are you doing?

46:23.640 --> 46:25.351
Tongue worm.

46:35.440 --> 46:36.919
Nice and easy.

46:36.920 --> 46:38.267
Okay.

46:39.760 --> 46:41.439
Ahhh.

46:41.440 --> 46:43.479
Close but no cigar.

46:43.480 --> 46:45.799
Don't be such a competitive creep.

46:45.800 --> 46:47.306
Come on, bud, it's your turn.

46:57.720 --> 46:59.799
Hey, Rad.

46:59.800 --> 47:01.829
Hey, Stacy.

47:04.800 --> 47:08.919
Aren't you going to introduce
us to your friends?

47:08.920 --> 47:11.159
Dad, Stacy Summers.

47:11.160 --> 47:12.879
Stacy Summers, Dad.

47:12.880 --> 47:14.759
Hi, Dad.

47:14.760 --> 47:16.141
Bye, Rad.

47:19.960 --> 47:21.519
She's really pretty!

47:21.520 --> 47:23.599
Dad, would you be quiet?

47:23.600 --> 47:25.982
Ahh, you choked.

47:27.560 --> 47:28.986
Alright, this is a one.

47:32.800 --> 47:35.199
Aww, I hate pirates!

47:35.200 --> 47:36.719
It's not his fault.

47:36.720 --> 47:39.227
Come on, Miss Peppy, you're up.

47:41.320 --> 47:42.826
Come on, sweetie.

47:48.840 --> 47:50.639
Michelle.

47:50.640 --> 47:52.199
What in the Sam Hill was that?

47:52.200 --> 47:54.039
Peppy golf.

47:54.040 --> 47:55.839
Why don't you try to have fun?

47:55.840 --> 47:57.359
I'm too cool for fun!

47:57.360 --> 47:59.479
Michelle!

47:59.480 --> 48:02.439
You come back here and
pick this up right now!

48:02.440 --> 48:04.265
Is it time to eat yet?

48:20.280 --> 48:23.719
Whoa! That was like 50 strokes!
Let's try to get to 500!

48:23.720 --> 48:28.239
- Really?
- Yeah, maybe we could get to 500!

48:28.240 --> 48:30.439
Okay, but try to keep it in play.

48:30.440 --> 48:31.799
No, doy.

48:31.800 --> 48:33.319
Sorry.

48:33.320 --> 48:36.305
Alright, ready? Go!

48:37.360 --> 48:38.319
One.

48:38.320 --> 48:39.519
Two.

48:39.520 --> 48:40.559
Three.

48:40.560 --> 48:41.679
Four.

48:41.680 --> 48:43.599
- Five.
- Six.

48:43.600 --> 48:44.599
Seven.

48:44.600 --> 48:46.061
Eight.

48:50.320 --> 48:51.759
Thirty-two.

48:51.760 --> 48:53.119
Thirty-three.

48:53.120 --> 48:54.679
- Thirty-four.
- Thirty-five.

48:54.680 --> 48:56.664
- Thirty-six.
- Thirty-seven.

49:03.240 --> 49:04.559
Seventy-five.

49:04.560 --> 49:05.799
Seventy-six.

49:05.800 --> 49:07.199
Seventy-seven.

49:07.200 --> 49:08.359
Seventy-eight. Seventy-nine.

49:08.360 --> 49:09.661
Eighty.

49:15.360 --> 49:18.106
488. 489.

49:19.800 --> 49:21.879
492. 493.

49:21.880 --> 49:24.103
494. 495.

49:25.880 --> 49:28.119
498. 499...

49:30.920 --> 49:35.111
Man, that close.

49:40.480 --> 49:42.079
Don't try it, Pop Tart,

49:42.080 --> 49:45.310
or you'll know what it's like to
be a little white plastic ball.

49:47.760 --> 49:49.119
That was mature.

49:49.120 --> 49:51.679
Oh, I'm mature, alright.

49:51.680 --> 49:54.479
Oh, he's mature.

49:54.480 --> 49:56.119
You know,

49:56.120 --> 49:57.839
you're not as good
as you think you are.

49:57.840 --> 50:00.825
Oh yeah? Well, how
good do I think I am?

50:04.680 --> 50:06.039
I'm way better than you.

50:06.040 --> 50:09.559
I at least know that much.

50:09.560 --> 50:12.399
Okay. Then let's
play again. Saturday.

50:12.400 --> 50:14.799
See who's the best,
once and for all.

50:14.800 --> 50:18.359
Saturday, huh? Why not now?

50:18.360 --> 50:22.479
We were just rallying for hours.
It wouldn't be fair.

50:22.480 --> 50:25.559
Okay. Saturday.

50:25.560 --> 50:28.479
One game. No excuses.

50:28.480 --> 50:30.828
I don't need any excuses.

50:35.560 --> 50:38.439
What did you just do?

50:38.440 --> 50:39.879
I don't know.

50:39.880 --> 50:41.386
You're crazy!

51:36.440 --> 51:38.599
Hey, there you are!

51:38.600 --> 51:40.319
Whoa.

51:40.320 --> 51:42.039
I told you my dad's
boombox was no joke!

51:42.040 --> 51:43.839
He let you borrow that?

51:43.840 --> 51:46.586
Oh, yeah. He lets me
borrow everything.

52:12.960 --> 52:14.679
Look.

52:14.680 --> 52:16.079
What?

52:16.080 --> 52:17.599
She doesn't have a Funk Punch.

52:17.600 --> 52:19.823
She's probably just hiding it.

52:26.120 --> 52:28.639
Hey, you two.

52:28.640 --> 52:29.919
What are you doing?

52:29.920 --> 52:32.479
Uh, nothing much.

52:32.480 --> 52:35.079
Oh hey, this is my cousin, Rhonda.

52:35.080 --> 52:36.119
She's sleeping over tonight.

52:36.120 --> 52:38.599
Hi.

52:38.600 --> 52:40.079
What's your name?

52:40.080 --> 52:42.399
Teddy.

52:42.400 --> 52:44.879
Hello, Teddy.

52:44.880 --> 52:48.119
His real name's Teduardo.

52:48.120 --> 52:50.959
Hey, you guys should come
to H2O with us tonight!

52:50.960 --> 52:52.479
What's that?

52:52.480 --> 52:54.679
It's the new underage dance club.

52:54.680 --> 52:57.879
They should come, right?

52:57.880 --> 52:59.799
Yeah, why not?

52:59.800 --> 53:02.959
You know how to dance, right?

53:02.960 --> 53:05.599
♪ I can rap and I can dance ♪

53:05.600 --> 53:07.759
♪ In a bathing suit
or in long pants ♪

53:07.760 --> 53:10.399
♪ At Fun Hub or in the club ♪

53:10.400 --> 53:13.351
♪ I'll show you skeezers
how it is done! ♪♪

53:16.320 --> 53:18.031
Dress to impress.

53:20.120 --> 53:21.839
Hey, gang.

53:21.840 --> 53:24.279
Time to take a pose
for a telescope photo

53:24.280 --> 53:27.060
and you can't say no!

53:30.680 --> 53:32.359
And...

53:32.360 --> 53:33.661
Right on!

53:55.080 --> 53:56.559
Rad! Where were you?

53:56.560 --> 53:58.199
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, guy.

53:58.200 --> 54:01.583
Alright, the gang's all here.
Let's go!

54:12.560 --> 54:14.305
"Suicide."

54:36.320 --> 54:38.065
Keep the change.

54:42.520 --> 54:44.679
- So, should we do it?
- What?

54:44.680 --> 54:48.268
Should we do it? Let's dance.

56:15.440 --> 56:19.267
[Midnight Star performing "No
Parking on the Dance Floor'?

57:12.040 --> 57:14.183
I don't even want
to go home tonight!

57:21.240 --> 57:23.349
Come sit next to me, Rad.

57:26.720 --> 57:28.159
Oh, no.

57:28.160 --> 57:30.110
You're coming with me.

57:34.640 --> 57:37.341
The moon looks def.

57:46.960 --> 57:49.359
I've been wanting
to be alone with you

57:49.360 --> 57:53.426
since I first laid eyes on
your tight bod this afternoon.

58:17.440 --> 58:19.639
I'm going to go pee now.

58:19.640 --> 58:21.066
Have fun!

58:25.560 --> 58:26.959
You can't get away from me.

58:26.960 --> 58:28.599
Get off me, ow!

58:28.600 --> 58:30.359
Where do you think you're going?

58:30.360 --> 58:31.759
Get back here!

58:31.760 --> 58:33.399
Oh.

58:33.400 --> 58:35.668
Have fun with your prude summer!

58:46.360 --> 58:48.039
Where's Teddy?

58:48.040 --> 58:52.679
Being a virgin somewhere.

58:52.680 --> 58:54.999
Where's Stacy?

58:55.000 --> 58:56.879
Dropping yellow.

58:56.880 --> 58:58.079
Huh?

58:58.080 --> 59:00.269
Peeing?

59:10.800 --> 59:14.559
Well, so what do you
want to do now?

59:14.560 --> 59:17.119
I don't know, go home I guess.

59:17.120 --> 59:18.799
Home's no fun.

59:18.800 --> 59:20.599
I guess not.

59:20.600 --> 59:24.263
I could think of a trillion funner
things to do than just going home.

59:31.720 --> 59:35.024
Shouldn't you be practicing
for the big showdown?

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:07.639
Nyack, nyack, nyack, nyack, nyack.

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:10.319
Nice space pants, Astra-Nut.

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:12.919
Why the long face?
You got girl problems?

01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:15.359
You couldn't get
a girl it you tried.

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:17.919
You're so skinny you got to run
around in the shower to get wet.

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.679
You need a fat one.

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:22.519
One that goes.

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:24.039
You couldn't catch a girl

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.759
if we tied a bone around your neck!

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.879
Loser!

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:32.239
You need that big girl to
come throw the ball for you.

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:36.759
Hey, go get his quarter, don't
let him get out of here!

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:53.159
You alright?

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:55.239
I'm fine.

01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:58.119
I don't think so. What happened?

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:03.039
I could've kissed her.

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:05.679
She wanted me to kiss her.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:07.879
But I chickened out.

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.306
And then she kissed Lyle.

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:13.839
Well, that's bad.

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:17.279
Um, but next time,
you should just, uh,

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:18.839
you know, make it simpler.

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:20.639
If you want to kiss her, kiss her.

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.399
If you don't want to kiss
her, don't kiss her,

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.199
and then, you know, if
she doesn't like you,

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:26.999
well then, you don't
want to kiss her. Right?

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.839
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:32.319
- Sorry for bothering you.
- What's your name, kid?

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:35.519
- Rad.
- Rad?

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:38.159
Rad. Rad.

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.999
Well, Rad, you know,

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.399
you don't have to apologize

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.319
to somebody for bothering them

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:45.479
if they're the one that
started the conversation.

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:48.279
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.741
Sorry.

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:15.239
Don't go near that place
if you can help it!

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:18.639
I think you might
want to leave, buddy.

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:21.227
What's your name, kid?

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:12.021
Rad?

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:14.879
Hey.

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:16.799
I'm sorry about the other night.

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.279
I got really drunk. I don't
even know what happened.

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:23.079
Well, maybe you should try
to control yourself better.

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:24.639
Look, I'm sorry if I gave you

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:26.159
the wrong idea about us, but...

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:29.079
No, I got the wrong idea about you.

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.839
It's not like we were
even close to dating.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:33.799
You know, Teddy warned
me and he was right.

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:37.741
You're nothing
but a stone-cold skeezer.

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:48.159
That was by far the coolest
thing you've ever done.

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:50.319
Felt pretty cool.

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:54.306
Whoa, maybe you actually are cool.

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:41.199
Yo, yo, yo, what's happening,

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:42.799
Ebony and Ivory?

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:45.439
Or is it Ebony and Ebony?

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:47.239
More like Ivory and Ivory!

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:49.599
Hope you've been
practicing, Miracle.

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:51.239
That's a fitting last name,

01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:52.959
since you're going to need one.

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:56.343
You should change your
last name to Skunk!

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:17.100
Hello?

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:45.719
You were a ping pong champion?

01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:49.119
And a bowling champion
and a hot rod champion,

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:51.639
but you were really
a ping pong champion?

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:56.039
Yeah. So?

01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:57.990
Can you help me?

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:08.759
It's time to cut these beauties.
You want to help?

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:10.471
Uh...

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:17.079
Well, I loved playing ping pong.

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:19.199
But, you know, to compete,
to be really good,

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:21.719
you just have to
practice all the time,

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:22.999
all the time. I mean,

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.079
you can't have vacations

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:27.279
or a social life,
anything like that.

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:31.239
And I hated the tournaments.

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:33.508
It just took all of the
fun out of it for me.

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:36.199
I don't want to become

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:38.707
some world class superstar.

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:43.700
I just really want to beat Lyle.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.519
Well...

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:53.479
I think it'll take one lesson

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:57.279
to beat that spoiled
little dipshit.

01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.786
Let's do it.

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:13.550
Whoa.

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:20.238
What's this?

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:21.759
This is your new paddle.

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:23.279
Here, let's get your finger out.

01:08:23.279 --> 01:08:25.038
See that grip? Good.

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:26.879
Show me what you got.

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:29.238
Aren't you going to play with me?

01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:31.118
No, you have to beat yourself
before you beat somebody else.

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:32.899
I'm just going to
sit here and drink.

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:36.359
That's it.

01:08:36.359 --> 01:08:39.639
The ball making contact, ball making
contact, ball making contact.

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.639
That's it. You don't
need crazy spin

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:44.238
or flashy moves, you don't
even need any style, really.

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:46.519
You just have to focus

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:49.319
and watch the ball making contact.

01:08:49.319 --> 01:08:51.118
Focus. Ball making contact,

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:52.799
ball making contact, good!

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:54.879
Ball making contact,
ball making contact...

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:58.627
Oh. Try it again.

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:05.719
Oh, you are in your head, man, and
you've got all this negative chatter

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:07.399
that you're thinking,
"I'm so nervous,"

01:09:07.399 --> 01:09:09.238
"I don't know what I'm doing,"

01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:13.279
"Lyle's too big," "What's Randi thinking?"
You've just got to switch it off, okay?

01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:15.078
And reload.

01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:17.439
Physically, mentally,
and emotionally.

01:09:17.439 --> 01:09:19.639
And you do that by having
a recovery routine.

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:20.679
Every pro has one.

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:23.439
After a point, you go to
your recovery routine.

01:09:23.439 --> 01:09:25.279
You might see some pros,

01:09:25.279 --> 01:09:27.118
they go up and they touch
the table like that,

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:28.919
or they blow on the ball,
they blow on their palms,

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:30.559
they take their towel
out, maybe all of them.

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:32.319
I used to jump
up-and-down on my toes

01:09:32.319 --> 01:09:33.639
and then go to my safe zone

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:35.359
and come back and focus.

01:09:35.359 --> 01:09:37.279
Got it?

01:09:37.279 --> 01:09:40.982
Okay, so, what is your
recovery routine going to be?

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:46.639
Okay, well, we don't have
to decide that right now.

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:49.719
Just start focusing. Go ahead.

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:52.341
Ball making contact, there you go.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.301
Good.

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:07.439
That's it.

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:09.199
The ball hitting the paddle.

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:11.319
That's it. Keep it low.

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:13.039
Use a smasher. You don't
want to give it to him.

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:16.599
That's it! The ball making contact, the ball
making contact, the ball making contact.

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:19.439
That's it, now focus, focus.

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:21.359
Good, good!

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:23.959
The ball making contact,
the ball making contact.

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:25.679
That's it, keep your focus.

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:27.559
Keep your focus, that's it.

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:29.559
Keep your focus.

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:31.399
That's it, that's it,
keep your focus.

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:34.679
Good. Okay.

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:37.839
The ball making contact,
the ball making contact,

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:45.119
the ball making contact,
the ball making contact,

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:48.559
the ball making contact,
the ball making contact,

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.199
the ball making contact,

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:52.946
good, the ball making contact.

01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:57.380
Oh, you lost your focus.

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:01.228
Teddy, get in here!

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.439
Teddy, this is Randi Jammer.

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:11.759
Randi Jammer, this is my
best friend, Teddy Fryy.

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:15.826
Well. Nice to meet you
best friend Teddy Fryy.

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:22.519
Are you going to come tomorrow?

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:24.424
You don't need me there.

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:30.719
Radford.

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:32.719
Radical.

01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:35.039
You're not Radford Miracle.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:39.519
You're Radical Miracle!

01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:41.959
And you're...

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:43.999
Teddy Flyy.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.839
And what about you, Randi Jammer?

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:50.030
You're the Rammer!

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:54.701
No.

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:05.159
Maybe I could come visit
you in Mount Airy.

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:09.545
Or you could come visit
me in Baltimore.

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:15.428
I don't really have
any friends back home.

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:19.066
I don't either.

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:28.227
I wish this summer
didn't ever have to end.

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:34.679
Yeah. It was the best summer ever.

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:36.799
But you know what's going
to make it even better?

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:38.279
What?

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:43.199
When you cream Lyle tomorrow!

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:46.519
Rad Miracle fold Lyle Ace
he was going to skunk him!

01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:49.300
And then he hawked
a loogie on his IROC!

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:59.599
One game. One game. No excuses.

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:03.199
What did you just do? You're crazy.

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:05.559
Do you "smort" cocaine?

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:07.999
- I'm going to go pee now.
- Have fun.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.348
Bologna and cheese.

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.319
Morning, bud.

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:18.319
Morning.

01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:22.759
So, I heard about your
big showdown today.

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:24.550
Who told you?

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:30.399
Teddy told Michelle
and she told us.

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:31.559
Are you going to come?

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:33.439
Do you want us to?

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:34.959
I guess so.

01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:38.399
Of course we're going to be there.

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:41.039
Listen, I hear this kid you're
playing is a real punk.

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:43.159
But remember, it's just a game,

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:45.119
and even if you lose,

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.599
it's not the end of the world.

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:47.999
It's just not.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.279
We'll love you no matter what.

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:54.279
I just want to beat him so bad.

01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:57.399
Bad meaning bad
or bad meaning good?

01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:00.067
- Bad meaning both.
- Hm.

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.599
Hey Michelle, can you
bring me my coffee?

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:08.159
Bring it yourself!

01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:10.799
She's got a mouth on
her, doesn't she?

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:12.959
I'm not asking, I'm telling!

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:14.625
Whatever.

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:28.270
I didn't want to splurge
but your mother insisted.

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:35.479
Come here.

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:37.748
Ohhh.

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:42.719
It was 37 dollars.

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:44.800
- We'll take it out of your pocket money.
- Oh, yeah.

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:49.943
Rad?

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:56.559
You look different.

01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:00.239
Listen, I'm so sorry things got
so messed up between us.

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:02.239
But I'm getting my
life back on track

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:05.199
and I'm off the Funk Punch forever.

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:07.319
What about cocaine?

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:09.359
I never did cocaine, Rad.

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:13.159
I guess you could say brain
freeze was my addiction.

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:16.519
Then what was the powder you
mixed into your Funk Punch?

01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:18.559
That was Pixie Stix.

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:20.879
It doubled the power
of my brain freeze.

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:24.239
But from here on out,
I am Sugar-Free Stacy.

01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:26.119
Good for you.

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.079
I've also been doing some thinking,

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:31.199
and realize that I think

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:34.239
I genuinely like you.

01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:37.079
Well, that's cool, but can
we talk about this later?

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:38.950
I kinda have to play Lyle now.

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:43.039
Kick his ass...

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:44.466
"Radical Miracle."

01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:59.230
This place is pretty cool.

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:05.319
Come on, Rad, you got this.

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:06.999
If he hits topspin,
you hit backspin.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.639
If he hits backspin,
you hit topspin.

01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:11.679
- Crush him. Crush him.
- If he hits something else,
just hit it over the net.

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:14.319
Everybody's here for you,
except probably those two.

01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:16.279
- Look at his stupid space pants.
- Did you see the way Stacy looked at you, too?

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:18.959
I think she really likes you.

01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:21.439
- Send him back to Pluto.
- You got this. You've been
using the little paddle,

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:23.479
Now you're going to get the big
paddle and you're going to do great.

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:25.559
- Watch. Ready?
- Remember everything Randi taught you.

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:26.879
- And go.
- You got this, Rad, you got this. You ready?

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:28.479
- Another one.
- Ready?

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:30.359
- You really think I can win?
- Kinda.

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:33.106
- And down.
- Ahhh!

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:47.879
A twerp paddle for a twerp twerp!

01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:52.079
- Well, that's just nasty.
- I don't like the look of that fella.

01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:54.030
Never trust a redhead.

01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:57.279
Did you see the look on his face

01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:59.759
when you called him
Radical Miracle?

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:01.519
Win or lose, we're getting
a bushel of crabs

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:04.359
tonight to celebrate.
You're all invited!

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:06.679
Alright! That's enough.

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:08.639
Rad, you look warmed up enough.

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:11.679
Lyle, as always,
you're smoking hot.

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:13.119
Win this thing,

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:15.661
and let's get this over with.

01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:24.519
Here you go, honey.

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:26.106
Good luck.

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:31.350
Volley for serve!

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:38.559
"P"...

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:39.719
"I"...

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:40.759
"N"...

01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:42.319
"G"...

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:44.065
Yeah!

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:01.550
One serving zero.

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:09.705
Two serving zero.

01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:22.229
Three serving zero.

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:32.265
Four serving zero.

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:39.104
Zero serving six.

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:45.140
Eight serving three.

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:51.467
Ouch.

01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:58.359
That wasn't fair.

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:00.025
Five serving fifteen.

01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:04.109
And it's out of here!

01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:07.199
Shut up!

01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:09.799
Seven serving eighteen.

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:11.959
Time out!

01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:13.559
Get over here.

01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:16.559
Oh, so now crazy lady is his coach.

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:18.559
Of course she is.

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:21.746
"Thank you so much for
coaching me, Weird Mommy!"

01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:26.999
What are you doing?

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.799
Losing, I guess.

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:30.879
Forget about them.

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:33.719
Switch it off. Reload.

01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:35.239
You know how to play,

01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:36.719
you know what you
have to do to win.

01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:40.759
The ball making contact, right?

01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:43.559
What you bring to that
table is who you are.

01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:48.399
You have the power inside
you to do this. You do.

01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:52.959
Now is the time
to stop being a loser.

01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:55.308
Now's the time to kiss the girl.

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:14.279
So I didn't mean
literally but good.

01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:15.839
You're going to take a breath,

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:18.479
recovery routine, focus.

01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:21.181
Then beat this prick.

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:27.839
The ball making contact,

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:30.119
the ball making contact,
the ball making contact.

01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:32.119
- What is your recovery routine?
- Ball making contact.

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:34.479
The ball making contact.
The ball making contact.

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:36.479
What is your recovery routine?

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:41.719
The ball making contact,
the ball making contact.

01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:43.439
What are you doing?

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:46.061
Stop breakdancing
and play ping pong!

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.159
Ooh! Yeah!

01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:54.359
Go, honey!

01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:55.991
Eight serving eighteen.

01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:00.668
Nine serving eighteen.

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:03.079
Ten serving eighteen.

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:07.439
Yeah!

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:09.639
Eleven serving eighteen.

01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:12.261
Luck-luck-luck-luck!

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:24.639
That's it, Rad.

01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:28.159
Shake it off, you got this.

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:30.144
Eighteen serving twelve.

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:51.239
You got to get it over the net.

01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:54.623
Nineteen serving thirteen.

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:17.469
Nineteen serving fifteen.

01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:24.839
Come on, Lyle.

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:26.519
Bite me, Dale!

01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:28.151
Sixteen serving nineteen.

01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:30.746
Your serve.

01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:40.079
Alright, Rad!

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:46.831
Seventeen serving nineteen.

01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:06.504
Eighteen serving nineteen!

01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:26.239
Good shot, Rad.

01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:28.542
Nineteen serving nineteen!

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.701
Oh my gosh, it's game
point! It's game point!

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:48.428
Twenty serving nineteen.

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:58.269
Yeah! You go! This!

01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:03.227
That was a big mistake.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.143
Twenty serving twenty.

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:25.879
Oh my God, he beat him? He won?

01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:27.719
No, he has to win by two.

01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:29.079
Come on, Rad. One more point.

01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:30.666
Twenty-one serving twenty!

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:34.341
Come on, Rad.

01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:40.919
The winner, Radical Miracle!

01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:48.021
The Rammer!
