21:02.870 --> 21:04.611
I know things were
pretty bad with your mom.

21:04.611 --> 21:06.743
No, I've just, you know,
been busy.

21:06.743 --> 21:08.354
Last time I saw her,
she thought I was your uncle

21:08.354 --> 21:10.486
and told me to vote
for Jimmy Carter.

21:10.486 --> 21:15.143
Oh, well, you know, at least
she's not a pedophile, so...

21:15.143 --> 21:18.102
I just meant
you used to come around more,

21:18.102 --> 21:19.582
with your friends.

21:19.582 --> 21:22.368
Yeah. Like I said,
I've been busy.

21:22.368 --> 21:23.760
How's Jade?

21:23.760 --> 21:24.979
What?

21:24.979 --> 21:27.373
I can't believe she got
that tattoo.

21:27.373 --> 21:28.722
What are you
talking about?

21:28.722 --> 21:31.246
You know they call it
a tramp stamp, right?

21:31.246 --> 21:33.509
How do you know about
Jade's tattoo?

24:42.959 --> 24:45.005
I just heard you calling
for Chico a bit ago.

24:45.005 --> 24:46.572

25:04.241 --> 25:07.723

hiding under the bed.

25:07.723 --> 25:11.074
What did you just say?

25:11.074 --> 25:14.600
Nicole says he hides
under the bed when he's scared.

25:14.600 --> 25:17.254
I didn't realize you
and my sister talked so much.

25:17.254 --> 25:19.996
Oh, you know,
just in passing.

anything bad happen to Chico.

about Rascal?

25:36.883 --> 25:38.232

25:38.232 --> 25:39.886
Then why aren't you out
looking for him?

I did. I just, uh,
couldn't find him.

in Nicole's room.

under the bed?

just say before that?

we both know you have another
big choice coming up,

a way for you

to not have to
make that choice?

I thought.

one wrong,
