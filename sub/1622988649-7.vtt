WEBVTT

00:01.088 --> 00:03.307
Got into a fight.
Dude died.

00:03.351 --> 00:04.787
Guy who owns the company
I skated for

00:04.830 --> 00:06.310
kept the dude's shirt
with my blood on it.

00:06.354 --> 00:07.703
So, you want us
to steal it?

00:07.746 --> 00:09.052
This is for our house!

00:09.096 --> 00:10.532
And we're gonna
go through there

00:10.575 --> 00:12.012
and we're gonna get
the safe out like we planned!

00:13.883 --> 00:15.667
Come on.

00:15.711 --> 00:17.147
Aah! Bitch!

00:17.191 --> 00:18.670
We'll be giving you
a memorandum that says

00:18.714 --> 00:20.498
you agree to transfer
Smurf's estate back to us.

00:20.542 --> 00:22.457
You're getting a little short on
friends in the department.

00:22.500 --> 00:25.112
It's a new era, though.
For you guys, for us.

00:25.155 --> 00:26.678
You get what you pay for.

00:26.722 --> 00:29.333
Internet cafés are all the rage
in Southeast Asia.

00:29.377 --> 00:31.031
Adrian loves 'em.

00:31.074 --> 00:32.684
Somebody's been sending money
to him down there, too.

00:32.728 --> 00:34.860
It's not smart for us
to hold onto a ton of coke.

00:34.904 --> 00:35.992
It's gonna cost you.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.341
Back your truck in.

00:37.385 --> 00:39.169
You looking
for somebody, pal?

00:39.213 --> 00:41.519
Max Cross.

00:41.563 --> 00:44.305
You're gonna kick me
30% of your take

00:44.348 --> 00:47.612
between Pendleton
and National City.

00:47.656 --> 00:49.179
Deal.

00:49.223 --> 00:50.702
Deran...?Do I know you?

00:50.746 --> 00:52.748
-Yeah. It's Billy.
It's your father.

00:52.791 --> 00:55.185
-I'm Cassandra.
-What are you doing here?

00:55.229 --> 00:57.361
I was going through
a rough patch.

00:57.405 --> 00:58.884
What do you see?

00:58.928 --> 01:00.451
I see
somebody I used to know.

01:00.495 --> 01:01.887
Where are we?

01:01.931 --> 01:04.020
That kid Brian
was scared of you.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.631
Should I be?

01:10.331 --> 01:16.250
♪ She stares deeply

01:16.293 --> 01:20.123
♪ Locked inside me

01:20.167 --> 01:23.387

02:07.562 --> 02:09.607
Del Mar Fair's
in three weeks.

02:09.651 --> 02:11.131
Tickets?

02:11.174 --> 02:14.090
No. Too many eyes
on the ticket booths.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.787
Concessions?

02:15.831 --> 02:18.442
Eh, we'd have to hit like
a dozen to make it worth it.

02:18.486 --> 02:20.966
Yeah.

02:21.010 --> 02:23.839
Got it?
Yeah.

02:23.882 --> 02:26.668
Andrew! Give it back.

02:26.711 --> 02:29.671
Stop!

02:29.714 --> 02:32.543
Well, hey, what about that
Radio Shack on Pacific?

02:32.587 --> 02:34.545
You know, Don works there.

02:34.589 --> 02:36.243
He knows when the new IBMs
-are coming out.
-Serial numbers?

02:36.286 --> 02:39.550
No fence is gonna touch
a computer.

02:41.552 --> 02:43.511
Sounds like breakfast
is ready.

02:43.554 --> 02:46.209
Waffles!

02:47.819 --> 02:51.432
You watch Jake get his ass
kicked?

02:53.782 --> 02:57.699
He's fine.

03:02.269 --> 03:03.705
Andrew!

03:08.275 --> 03:10.407
Eat.

03:15.282 --> 03:17.458
Alright, fine.

03:17.501 --> 03:19.286
You don't want to eat
your waffles?

03:19.329 --> 03:21.592
Uncle Manny will eat
your waffles.

03:24.726 --> 03:26.249
Uncle, huh?

03:29.296 --> 03:31.950
You had your chance, man.

03:31.994 --> 03:35.040
Give that back!

03:35.084 --> 03:37.260
Can you watch him for a bit?

03:37.304 --> 03:39.915
Babysit?
Yeah, babysit.

03:39.958 --> 03:43.266
Ray's in Tijuana and I have to
give Max his cut.

03:43.310 --> 03:44.789
Come on. I got shit to do,
Janine.

03:44.833 --> 03:48.315
Manny, please.

03:56.018 --> 03:57.193
Aah!

03:57.237 --> 04:00.283
Ha.
Whoo! Ha.

04:00.327 --> 04:02.894
Aah!

04:06.594 --> 04:10.075
You need to relax.

04:10.119 --> 04:12.208
I mean,
when you're shooting.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.733
Relax. Okay. Okay.

04:27.441 --> 04:32.054
Does it always
feel like that?

04:32.097 --> 04:35.536
Feels different every time.

04:35.579 --> 04:37.015
More.

05:16.228 --> 05:18.143
Do it.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.107
You want me to shoot you?

05:25.150 --> 05:29.329
It's okay.

05:29.372 --> 05:31.809
No.

05:31.853 --> 05:34.159
I deserve it.

05:34.203 --> 05:38.120
Andrew, no, you don't.

05:38.163 --> 05:42.298
I deserve it.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.213
What?

05:56.051 --> 05:58.532
She wanted me dead.

06:01.143 --> 06:03.101
Who?

06:06.888 --> 06:10.500
Aah!

06:10.544 --> 06:13.938
My mom.
She wanted to kill me.

06:19.814 --> 06:21.250
Why?

06:25.123 --> 06:27.387
Because she
knew what I was.

06:27.430 --> 06:29.258
She knows what I am.

06:32.261 --> 06:34.176
Do it.

06:38.049 --> 06:41.270
Sounds like
she didn't know shit.

06:41.313 --> 06:43.881
I'm not gonna do that.

06:57.112 --> 06:59.636
Okay.

07:03.379 --> 07:05.337
Well, swell's coming in.

07:05.381 --> 07:07.775
Yeah. Waves woke Nick up.

07:07.818 --> 07:10.908
Took him for a walk out by those
new condos they're building.

07:10.952 --> 07:13.737
Oh, the one those assholes tore
up all the pier parking for?

07:13.781 --> 07:16.218
Yeah. Tamsin's brother's
working there.

07:16.261 --> 07:19.743
Gets paid in cash.

07:19.787 --> 07:21.223
So?

07:21.266 --> 07:22.877
So there's a couple hundred
people over there

07:22.920 --> 07:24.966
getting paid in cash
every other Thursday.

07:25.009 --> 07:29.100
Scope it out and maybe we can
-hit it after payday.
-Yeah.

07:29.144 --> 07:31.102
Yeah, we should hit that,
you know?

07:31.146 --> 07:32.974
It's only six blocks from
the house

07:33.017 --> 07:34.802
and I went to high school with
half the people working there.

07:34.845 --> 07:36.760
But yeah. It's a great idea.

07:36.804 --> 07:38.675
Don't be such an asshole
about it.

07:40.503 --> 07:42.374
-So what's next?
-What's next?

07:42.418 --> 07:43.854
It has to be cash, right?

07:43.898 --> 07:46.074
You doing a job
was a one-time thing.

07:46.117 --> 07:49.512
Why?

07:50.818 --> 07:54.299
Deran should never have
asked you.

07:54.343 --> 07:56.214
What?

07:56.258 --> 07:58.347
I didn't want you there.

08:01.829 --> 08:03.178
So that's why you keep pushing

08:03.221 --> 08:05.310
the me being
a real estate agent bullshit?

08:05.354 --> 08:08.139
It's not bullshit.
I think you'd be great at it.

08:08.183 --> 08:11.055
Oh, yeah, you should know,
property manager.

08:11.099 --> 08:14.972
Oh, my God. Look,
-it's different, okay?
-Yeah?

08:15.016 --> 08:17.061
You know, even if I wanted to be
a real estate agent,

08:17.105 --> 08:19.499
I wouldn't start making money
for what, at least another year?

08:19.542 --> 08:20.804
So?

08:20.848 --> 08:22.632
So we have bills.

08:22.676 --> 08:24.808
And I've already told you,
I'll take care of it! Jesus!

08:24.852 --> 08:26.680
Of course you will.
Mother...

08:33.687 --> 08:37.821
Damn, Pope, where are you?

08:37.865 --> 08:39.431
Everything good with
the Johnson deal?

08:39.475 --> 08:42.260
I'm meeting
the granddaughter today.

08:44.045 --> 08:47.614
Okay. Good.
Get that shit signed.

08:47.657 --> 08:49.833
That the share for
Pamela Johnson?

08:49.877 --> 08:51.661
Yeah.

08:51.705 --> 08:53.837
What else was in that safe?

08:53.881 --> 08:58.973
Jewelry, chains,
a couple guns.

08:59.016 --> 09:01.236
Alright,
we'll fence all that.

09:01.279 --> 09:04.195
Yeah. Or Pete could pay up.

09:04.239 --> 09:06.154
He will.

09:06.197 --> 09:08.852
Sometime this year
would be nice.

09:08.896 --> 09:11.115
Hey, that cop showed up again,

09:11.159 --> 09:13.161
the one that keeps
hanging around.

09:13.204 --> 09:14.554
What cop?

09:14.597 --> 09:18.340
The one that picked up Pope.

09:18.383 --> 09:19.907
What'd he want?

09:19.950 --> 09:21.256
He wants to work together,

09:21.299 --> 09:24.389
so I asked to bring me
anything he had on us.

09:24.433 --> 09:26.870
You didn't think you should ask
us first?

09:26.914 --> 09:29.960
Don't you want to know if
they're working anything active?

09:33.181 --> 09:37.402
Yeah. Alright. Fine.

09:41.319 --> 09:44.584
Yo.

09:54.332 --> 09:55.856
Yo.

09:55.899 --> 09:57.727
I don't think these babies
are getting enough sunlight

09:57.771 --> 09:59.424
down here.

09:59.468 --> 10:01.252
You hear about the fridge?

10:01.296 --> 10:04.125
Well, man,
-I'm here for the rent.
-Shit. Right.

10:04.168 --> 10:05.692
Can I hit you up later
this week?

10:05.735 --> 10:07.694
No, you can't, man.

10:07.737 --> 10:08.999
You really should check out
that fridge.

10:09.043 --> 10:10.522
It's leaking shit all over
the flooring.

10:10.566 --> 10:12.263
-Oh, yeah? Mm-hmm.
-Yeah?

10:12.307 --> 10:15.136
And the power goes out
-like once a month.
-Right.

10:15.179 --> 10:17.225
Cockroaches all over
-the place in there.
-Mm-hmm.

10:17.268 --> 10:19.749
At least Smurf
-took care of shit.
-Oh, is that right?

10:19.793 --> 10:22.534
Yo, man!
These things are fragile!

10:22.578 --> 10:24.667
You owe me a grand.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.234
Smurf and me had a deal.

10:26.277 --> 10:30.107
Don't say her name again.
You understand?

10:30.151 --> 10:32.283
Sit down!

10:32.327 --> 10:34.546
You think I'm joking around?

10:34.590 --> 10:36.679
Aah!

10:36.723 --> 10:40.509
I will kick your ass, bro.

10:48.517 --> 10:51.041
Well?

10:51.085 --> 10:53.740
What?

10:53.783 --> 10:56.481
What time did I say?

10:56.525 --> 10:58.048
You have to forgive Max.

10:58.092 --> 11:01.008
He gets a little bitchy before
his morning smoke.

11:03.445 --> 11:05.142
Do I need to count this?

11:05.186 --> 11:08.276
No.

11:08.319 --> 11:09.886
You know, I would've thought
that you would have gotten more

11:09.930 --> 11:12.715
than 6 grand from that
payday lender.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.195
Yeah, you'd think so,

11:14.238 --> 11:15.631
but these places will
really take anything

11:15.675 --> 11:17.764
as collateral, man.

11:17.807 --> 11:19.417
My buddy Eddie was all
strung out,

11:19.461 --> 11:21.637
wrote one of these places
a few bad checks,

11:21.681 --> 11:23.508
all he had to offer were
his teeth.

11:23.552 --> 11:25.989
Hey, shut up.

11:28.557 --> 11:31.865
You need to think bigger,
you know, for the next job.

11:31.908 --> 11:33.693
Alright,
we decide what we hit.

11:33.736 --> 11:35.956
You keep pulling in this
small-town shit,

11:35.999 --> 11:39.437
you're not gonna for long.

11:39.481 --> 11:43.703
You need to step it up.

11:53.843 --> 11:56.541
You must be Janine.

11:56.585 --> 11:59.240
Max keeps talking about this
pain in the ass chick

11:59.283 --> 12:00.807
working for him.

12:00.850 --> 12:03.026
I don't work for him.

12:03.070 --> 12:04.985
Everyone around here does.

12:05.028 --> 12:07.988
Yeah? What do you do?

12:08.031 --> 12:11.556
Guerrero's finest.

12:11.600 --> 12:14.690
What's his cut?

12:14.734 --> 12:16.997
20%.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.650
20%?

12:18.694 --> 12:20.609
What's he charging you?

12:20.652 --> 12:23.394
30%.

12:23.438 --> 12:25.309
You're new to town.

12:25.353 --> 12:28.051
Once you prove yourself,
he'll knock it down.

12:28.095 --> 12:30.358
Mm.

12:30.401 --> 12:32.664
Hey, you surf?

12:32.708 --> 12:36.756
Oh, you can't call yourself
a local if you don't surf.

12:36.799 --> 12:38.366
I know.

12:38.409 --> 12:40.368
Looks like a waste of time
to me.

12:40.411 --> 12:44.067
That's the point.

12:44.111 --> 12:49.159
Come on. I'll, uh,
I'll take you out.

12:49.203 --> 12:51.858
Alright.

12:51.901 --> 12:53.424
Let's so surfing.

12:53.468 --> 12:55.426
Right on.

12:55.470 --> 13:00.475
I'm, uh, I'm -- I'm Billy,
by the way.

13:00.518 --> 13:03.652
Pleased to meet you, Billy.

13:03.695 --> 13:06.307
My boards
are this way.

13:06.350 --> 13:07.830
Alright.

13:14.315 --> 13:16.926
-What's up?
-What's up?

13:16.970 --> 13:19.450
Done or you want to stay out
for a few more?

13:19.494 --> 13:21.104
No, I'm done.

13:21.148 --> 13:25.108
Come on, man, we haven't surfed
out here in forever.

13:26.675 --> 13:27.894
What's up?

13:27.937 --> 13:29.634
-What?
-What's going on with you?

13:29.678 --> 13:31.114
You're acting like a dick.

13:31.158 --> 13:33.247
Is this about the job?

13:33.290 --> 13:34.944
We got the house back.
Everything's fine.

13:34.988 --> 13:37.599
We came out clean.
Renn's fine.

13:37.642 --> 13:40.210
Yeah. Renn's great.

13:40.254 --> 13:41.777
Yeah, now she wants to knock off
a construction site

13:41.821 --> 13:44.954
because of you.

13:44.998 --> 13:46.651
This is about Renn, huh?

13:46.695 --> 13:48.131
No, man, it's about you.

13:48.175 --> 13:49.437
You're always bitching about
how you want out.

13:49.480 --> 13:50.960
Now you want to make
all the calls?

13:51.004 --> 13:52.222
You know,
somebody's got to do it.

13:52.266 --> 13:53.745
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

13:53.789 --> 13:56.139
You asked me
to stay here, so I stayed.

13:56.183 --> 13:57.837
I-I -- What -- What more
do you want me to do?

13:57.880 --> 13:59.534
Yeah, I did, but I didn't know
how this shit was gonna turn out

13:59.577 --> 14:00.927
when I did.

14:00.970 --> 14:02.842
So why don't you just keep
my family out of it, man?

14:02.885 --> 14:05.453
-Oh, your family?
-Yeah.

14:05.496 --> 14:07.368
Right.

14:07.411 --> 14:09.413
Your kid spends more time
with the goddamn babysitter

14:09.457 --> 14:10.980
than he does with you.

14:11.024 --> 14:12.503
How about you figure out how to
take care of your own family

14:12.547 --> 14:16.290
before you start judging me
on how to take care of ours?

14:16.333 --> 14:18.683
Goddamnit!

14:31.653 --> 14:33.611
Alright.

14:33.655 --> 14:37.311
We made it.

14:37.354 --> 14:40.009
Where are we?

14:40.053 --> 14:43.839
You're gonna love it.

15:23.226 --> 15:26.403
Oh, this feels amazing.

15:29.189 --> 15:30.755
You coming in?

16:21.589 --> 16:24.287
Ahh!

16:24.331 --> 16:25.593
Oh!

16:25.636 --> 16:27.682
So good, right?

16:27.725 --> 16:28.944
Oh!

16:28.988 --> 16:32.600
Oh, it's so good.

16:32.643 --> 16:36.299
Oh! I used to love swimming
when I was a kid.

16:36.343 --> 16:37.997
-Yeah?
-Yeah. I loved it.

16:54.056 --> 16:56.493
Too much?

16:56.537 --> 16:58.887
No.

16:58.930 --> 17:04.066
What that guy said was right.

17:04.110 --> 17:07.896
I am the devil.

17:07.939 --> 17:09.506
Andrew....

17:09.550 --> 17:14.163
the devil is just
an angel who lost his way.

17:14.207 --> 17:16.948
God's the one
who sent him away.

17:16.992 --> 17:20.256
What did he expect?

17:29.831 --> 17:31.789
Hola, Cam.

17:31.833 --> 17:34.183
You're not returning
-my calls.
-Make it quick.

17:34.227 --> 17:35.706
Andre'll be back from lunch
any minute.

17:35.750 --> 17:39.623
Okay, I want back in.
My usual, every other week.

17:39.667 --> 17:41.582
Thought you were on
maternity leave.

17:41.625 --> 17:43.192
Not anymore.

17:43.236 --> 17:45.499
Look, slow down.
I don't have anything in here.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.283
Okay, I'll just come by
your place later then.

17:47.327 --> 17:51.113
Yeah,
-I don't think so.
-Why not?

17:51.157 --> 17:52.723
All this back and forth,
you being in and out?

17:52.767 --> 17:54.725
It's not cool.

17:54.769 --> 17:57.467
I'm in. For good.

17:57.511 --> 17:59.469
Yeah, well, I got guys
I can count on

17:59.513 --> 18:01.254
and your customers
have moved on.

18:01.297 --> 18:06.128
Bullshit. You know I can get
them back with a phone call.

18:06.172 --> 18:10.089
No.

18:10.132 --> 18:12.917
Start me off with half.

18:12.961 --> 18:16.399
No.

18:16.443 --> 18:18.401
Man, every time I get to
the end of that level,

18:18.445 --> 18:21.535
this bot pops up out of nowhere
and snipes me.

18:21.578 --> 18:24.059
That's why I quit on that game,
man.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.669
Uh, you forgot something.

18:25.713 --> 18:27.584
We usually get five
of the Pasote.

18:27.628 --> 18:29.412
That's not
what the order says.

18:29.456 --> 18:31.110
Well, it must be something on
your end, then.

18:31.153 --> 18:32.372
It's all good.

18:32.415 --> 18:33.721
We'll, uh, just take the usual,

18:33.764 --> 18:36.811
and we'll settle up
on the next bill.

18:36.854 --> 18:40.119
Sorry. The rest of my shit is
for Sun of a Beach.

18:40.162 --> 18:42.033
They opened?

18:42.077 --> 18:43.600
Yeah.

18:43.644 --> 18:47.213
Goddamnit.
Well, sucks for them.

18:47.256 --> 18:49.780
Tommy, go get the rest
of the Pasote.

18:57.832 --> 18:59.660
<i>Big Red is on the outside,</i>

18:59.703 --> 19:01.618
<i>gaining on Ajax on the rail.</i>

19:01.662 --> 19:02.967
<i>Suzan With a Z
closing the gap...</i>

19:03.011 --> 19:04.273
Come on, come on, come on!

19:04.317 --> 19:06.145
<i>...as Ajax falters.</i>

19:06.188 --> 19:07.885
Hey, not in the car,
not in the car.

19:07.929 --> 19:11.150
<i>...and champion Ajax no longer
in a fight for place.</i>

19:11.193 --> 19:12.673
Come on. <i>And that's the wire.</i>

19:12.716 --> 19:14.936
<i>It's Big Red by... Shit!</i>

19:14.979 --> 19:17.199
<i>...and now Champ's
second by three.</i>

19:17.243 --> 19:19.506
<i>Ajax third, and whipping in...</i>

19:25.381 --> 19:28.732
Bruce,
did you just see that?

19:28.776 --> 19:30.473
Yeah, I know.

19:30.517 --> 19:31.909
Hey, hey, hey, how about, uh,

19:31.953 --> 19:35.478
how about $30 on Jumper
for the sixth?

19:35.522 --> 19:37.350
Yeah.

19:37.393 --> 19:40.831
Yeah, I know, look,
I'll pay you back, plus $20.

19:40.875 --> 19:43.747
I-I told you I would get you
back for that.

19:43.791 --> 19:49.100
Look, Bruce, just put $30 on
Jumper for the sixth, okay?

19:49.144 --> 19:50.885
Bruce?

19:50.928 --> 19:52.930
Bruce?!

19:52.974 --> 19:55.368
Goddamnit.

19:55.411 --> 19:57.196
Ha! Got you now, huh?

19:57.239 --> 19:59.502
Hey, you're good at looking
-after your brother, right?
-Yeah.

19:59.546 --> 20:02.244
You think you can take care of
him till your mom gets back?

20:02.288 --> 20:06.117
-Is she with Max?
-Yeah.

20:06.161 --> 20:08.337
What if she's in trouble?

20:08.381 --> 20:12.341
Your mom is trouble, kid.
But she's fine, okay?

20:12.385 --> 20:13.995
Now I want you guys to go
inside, lock the door,

20:14.038 --> 20:16.954
and don't open the door
for anybody, okay?

20:16.998 --> 20:18.347
Get in.

20:21.307 --> 20:22.612
Damn it.

20:32.579 --> 20:35.190
Is there a problem?

20:35.234 --> 20:37.584
There shouldn't be.

20:37.627 --> 20:39.194
Then again, you should have
dropped off that safe

20:39.238 --> 20:43.285
like my grandma asked, so let's
just call this due diligence.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.244
We had to protect ourselves.

20:45.287 --> 20:47.028
She would have kept up her end.

20:47.071 --> 20:49.552
If you say so.

20:49.596 --> 20:51.772
Okay.

20:59.736 --> 21:02.391
Your grandmother
-needs to sign.
-Oh, don't worry.

21:02.435 --> 21:05.525
I sign everything
on her behalf.

21:05.568 --> 21:08.571
It looks like you know a thing
or two about that

21:08.615 --> 21:10.312
'cause some of those
property titles

21:10.356 --> 21:11.835
have your signature on them.

21:11.879 --> 21:14.273
I was Smurf's power of attorney
for awhile.

21:14.316 --> 21:18.494
Mm. Why you and not
one of her sons?

21:21.149 --> 21:23.586
Why you?

21:23.630 --> 21:28.112
Phoenix doesn't have
the patience.

21:28.156 --> 21:30.245
Neither do my uncles.

21:33.422 --> 21:36.947
Here's the shirt.

21:36.991 --> 21:40.386
No way was this the only thing
in that safe.

21:40.429 --> 21:44.868
Finder's fee.

21:53.486 --> 21:55.662
Hey. Hey, Craig.

21:55.705 --> 21:56.924
What?

21:56.967 --> 21:58.447
Hey, uh, think you could
buy us some beer?

21:58.491 --> 22:00.797
The guy at the Liquor Barn
took my fake.

22:00.841 --> 22:02.799
Well, then, just grab something
from the left of the counter.

22:02.843 --> 22:05.106
The clerk's got a lazy eye.
It's easy.

22:05.149 --> 22:06.629
Come on, man.

22:06.673 --> 22:09.371
We just -- We just need, like,
a six pack, or two?

22:09.415 --> 22:10.981
I mean, we can all share.

22:11.025 --> 22:13.984
How long have you guys been out
here for?

22:14.028 --> 22:15.464
A few hours.

22:15.508 --> 22:17.423
For a six pack?

22:17.466 --> 22:20.556
-Uh...yeah?
-Jesus.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.254
Come on, man.
Seriously, like...

22:27.520 --> 22:29.478
You know what? Screw it.

22:29.522 --> 22:31.959
Let's do a party at the Cody
place, okay?

22:32.002 --> 22:33.526
Yo -- Yo, really?

22:33.569 --> 22:36.529
If you promise not to pull any
of that weak ass shit, sure.

22:36.572 --> 22:38.008
Yeah. W-Whatever you say, man.

22:38.052 --> 22:40.359
Alright, look, just bring
whatever you want

22:40.402 --> 22:42.056
and I'll handle
the rest, okay?

22:42.099 --> 22:44.493
Okay. Alright.

22:44.537 --> 22:46.408
Uh, hey, guys,
party at the Cody house.

22:46.452 --> 22:49.455
-Party at the Cody house!
-Whoo!

23:00.553 --> 23:03.991
Can you hang out for like
20 minutes?

23:04.034 --> 23:05.993
Yeah.

23:06.036 --> 23:08.430
20 minutes, I promise.

23:35.805 --> 23:38.329
Yeah?

23:38.373 --> 23:40.506
Pope...

23:40.549 --> 23:41.985
Jesus, w-where --
what's going on, man?

23:42.029 --> 23:44.379
Where have you been?

23:44.423 --> 23:48.514
Just, um, driving...

23:48.557 --> 23:52.561
...swimming.

23:52.605 --> 23:54.520
Alright, well, look.

23:54.563 --> 23:56.217
We, uh,
we got the house back.

23:56.260 --> 23:58.262
That's good, man.

23:58.306 --> 24:00.003
Yeah, it's great.

24:00.047 --> 24:01.962
Um, you know, I was thinking
maybe when you get back,

24:02.005 --> 24:03.572
we could, uh, tear up
the basketball court,

24:03.616 --> 24:05.356
put in a halfpipe
or a jacuzzi or something.

24:05.400 --> 24:06.793
What do you think?

24:06.836 --> 24:08.664
-Halfpipe?
-I mean, yeah.

24:08.708 --> 24:10.274
Whatever -- you know,
whatever we want.

24:10.318 --> 24:13.016
The place is ours now.

24:13.060 --> 24:14.583
Well, whatever you want.

24:14.627 --> 24:15.976
Well, maybe we can go.

24:16.019 --> 24:17.760
So, uh, when are you --
when are you --

24:17.804 --> 24:19.588
when are you thinking
about coming back?

24:19.632 --> 24:21.372
And then we can go and it could
be a surprise.

24:21.416 --> 24:23.418
-Yeah. That'd be awesome.
-Pope?

24:23.462 --> 24:26.552
I got to go, Deran.

24:28.379 --> 24:31.165
Dad got pissed at me
this morning.

24:31.208 --> 24:33.080
Why?

24:34.516 --> 24:37.345
Cassie! What the hell?

24:37.388 --> 24:38.825
Baby, you don't need to treat
anybody -- anybody --

24:38.868 --> 24:40.043
What do you think
you're doing?

24:40.087 --> 24:42.002
You know,
I knew something was up

24:42.045 --> 24:43.482
when you didn't answer
-your phone, so I pinged you.
-Liam --

24:43.525 --> 24:44.613
-Go wait in the car.
-Liam --

24:44.657 --> 24:46.136
-Go wait in the car.
-Dad!

24:46.180 --> 24:48.051
-Don't look at her. Just go.
-It's okay, baby.

24:48.095 --> 24:49.618
Go. Go, go, go, go, go.

24:49.662 --> 24:51.620
-I just wanted to see him.
-Oh, you want to see him?

24:51.664 --> 24:53.143
Is that what you were doing
in my pool this morning --

24:53.187 --> 24:54.928
trying to see him?

24:54.971 --> 24:57.539
The neighbors saw you.
You are so screwed.

24:57.583 --> 24:59.193
I can't wait to bring this up

24:59.236 --> 25:00.803
next time
-we're in front of a judge.
-You're an asshole.

25:00.847 --> 25:02.501
Come on. You're already
supposed to be there.

25:02.544 --> 25:04.328
-Let's go.
-Liam, I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

25:04.372 --> 25:06.026
Oh, "I'm sorry."

25:06.069 --> 25:07.636
Screw you!

25:07.680 --> 25:09.986
He's my son, too!

25:28.178 --> 25:32.226
See, Janine?
Surfing ain't so bad.

25:35.185 --> 25:38.406
You know, you'd think this van
isn't built for a good time,

25:38.449 --> 25:40.843
but somehow,
when shit goes down,

25:40.887 --> 25:44.368
it always offers you a handhold
right when you need it.

25:44.412 --> 25:45.587
Oh, my God.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.589
Do you ever stop talking?

25:47.633 --> 25:49.765
Why would I?

25:49.809 --> 25:51.506
You really live in here?

25:51.550 --> 25:52.899
Yep.

25:52.942 --> 25:55.771
Taking it for a run down to
Mexico next week.

25:55.815 --> 25:58.687
You should come.

25:58.731 --> 26:00.994
I can't.

26:01.037 --> 26:02.561
Why not?

26:02.604 --> 26:03.779
'Cause I got shit to do.

26:03.823 --> 26:06.477
-Come on.
-Oh!

26:06.521 --> 26:08.697
All work, no play?

26:12.440 --> 26:14.224
I got to go.

26:14.268 --> 26:16.183
Come on. So soon?

26:16.226 --> 26:17.750
Why?

26:17.793 --> 26:19.752
You want to give me another
surfing lesson?

26:19.795 --> 26:25.279
Well, practice makes perfect.

26:25.322 --> 26:27.237
I'll see you later.

26:30.197 --> 26:31.851

from Sun of a Beach.

29:12.925 --> 29:16.189
Cool spot.

29:16.232 --> 29:18.582
Look, I think there may have
been some confusion

29:18.626 --> 29:20.193
with my liquor order.

29:20.236 --> 29:23.326
You ended up with a few
of my boxes.

29:23.370 --> 29:27.678
Yeah, there's no confusion.
Those are ours.

29:27.722 --> 29:30.159
Like, I get it.
Ben's afraid of you.

29:30.203 --> 29:34.076
But I don't know you
and I don't really care.

29:34.120 --> 29:35.817
I just want my shit back.

29:35.861 --> 29:37.776
I don't know what to tell you.

29:37.819 --> 29:40.474
I got nothing to give you.

29:40.517 --> 29:42.650
If it's about money, I'm down to
throw you some cash for them.

29:42.693 --> 29:44.870
It looks like you could use it.

29:44.913 --> 29:46.393
-That's funny.
-Yeah.

29:46.436 --> 29:48.917
Yeah, I don't need
your money.

29:48.961 --> 29:52.094
Cool. I'll just take
my booze back.

29:52.138 --> 29:54.401
Yeah, maybe I'll start
with this.

29:57.534 --> 30:01.625
Get out of my bar.

30:06.326 --> 30:08.589
I'll see you around.

30:18.077 --> 30:20.209
What was that about?

30:20.253 --> 30:23.038
Nothing.
How did the thing go?

30:23.082 --> 30:25.780
Good. That's it.

30:30.176 --> 30:32.308
Great.

30:32.352 --> 30:34.136
Stash this in the safe
at the house.

30:34.180 --> 30:37.183
Uh, I was thinking we could keep
it here for a couple of days.

30:37.226 --> 30:39.359
The house is a little crazy
right now.

30:39.402 --> 30:41.883
What's going on?

30:41.927 --> 30:44.407
Craig.

30:44.451 --> 30:45.669
Jesus. Alright.

30:45.713 --> 30:48.455
You know what's up with him?

30:48.498 --> 30:50.979
Yeah, I don't know.

30:51.023 --> 30:53.329
You were right.

30:53.373 --> 30:56.637
What we did for Pamela.
It worked.

30:56.680 --> 30:58.552
I'm glad we got the house back.

31:02.730 --> 31:04.471
You want a drink or something?

31:04.514 --> 31:05.820
I can't.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.866
I've got some stuff to do
before I meet Pete.

31:07.909 --> 31:12.044
I think he's got a buyer.

31:14.046 --> 31:16.918
Come on!

31:25.231 --> 31:27.276
Haven't seen you around.

31:27.320 --> 31:29.626
I've been busy.
-Busy?

31:29.670 --> 31:31.019
-Uh-huh.
-Sounds boring.

31:31.063 --> 31:33.456
Yeah, well,
so is running low.

31:33.500 --> 31:37.417
I'll see what I can get.

31:39.767 --> 31:43.640
Yeah, baby! Whoo!

31:43.684 --> 31:46.861
Yo, you want some of this?

31:46.905 --> 31:49.559
Nah. I'm good, dude. Nah.

31:49.603 --> 31:51.605
You?

31:51.648 --> 31:54.042
Uh, no. I'm good, man.

31:54.086 --> 31:56.871
Pussies.

32:00.353 --> 32:03.573
Yeah!

32:03.617 --> 32:07.708
Well, this is a bust.

32:07.751 --> 32:11.103
Yo, let's go.

32:11.146 --> 32:14.671
Yo! Party's moving. Let's go.

32:19.720 --> 32:21.678
Julia, Andrew?

32:21.722 --> 32:25.030
Guys, you don't clean up after
yourselves anymore?

32:32.037 --> 32:37.433
Andrew, Julia, I'm home.

32:40.828 --> 32:43.091
Guys?

32:49.228 --> 32:52.274
Andrew, Julia?

32:52.318 --> 32:55.016
Hey, have you seen my kids?
Have you seen my kids?

33:13.861 --> 33:16.124
I know you said
you didn't want anything,

33:16.168 --> 33:19.040
but I couldn't let you go
empty-handed.

33:19.084 --> 33:20.999
Is turkey okay?

33:21.042 --> 33:25.829
Yeah. Thanks.

33:25.873 --> 33:28.397
Joshua Tree is 30 minutes away.

33:28.441 --> 33:32.053
You should stop
on your way east.

33:32.097 --> 33:36.579
So...

33:36.623 --> 33:39.234
that kid --

33:39.278 --> 33:43.151
he's your son?

33:43.195 --> 33:46.807
Yeah. Yeah.

33:46.850 --> 33:50.071
And the guy...

33:50.115 --> 33:55.076
Liam. My ex.

33:55.120 --> 33:58.601
So, like...

33:58.645 --> 34:02.257
like, why isn't your --
your kid with you?

34:05.260 --> 34:08.002
Punishment.

34:08.046 --> 34:11.484
For the divorce.

34:11.527 --> 34:15.749
So why did you even let him
take him?

34:18.012 --> 34:21.494
Let -- Let him take him?

34:21.537 --> 34:23.713
Is that -- that what you think
I'm -- I'm doing?

34:23.757 --> 34:25.585
No, no. I-I didn't mean --

34:25.628 --> 34:27.804
Yeah, because I have --
I have tried everything that

34:27.848 --> 34:29.763
I could possibly try --Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

34:29.806 --> 34:33.201
...and paid everything that
I could possibly pay.

34:33.245 --> 34:36.726
I would do anything to have
Henry back.

34:36.770 --> 34:40.034
When I'm not with him, it's like
a part of me is missing.

34:43.646 --> 34:45.692
Why am I even
telling you this?

34:45.735 --> 34:48.434
I don't even know you.

34:48.477 --> 34:50.436
God.

34:50.479 --> 34:52.612
Last night was fun,
and thank you for the ride,

34:52.655 --> 34:56.311
-but you should go.
-Hey, listen.

34:56.355 --> 34:58.400
No. I didn't mean it like --

34:58.444 --> 35:01.186
No, you don't get it!
You don't get it.

35:06.365 --> 35:09.368
Please, just go.

35:36.003 --> 35:38.179
Got to be one of the slowest
nights we've ever had.

35:46.274 --> 35:48.755
I can't believe people want to
go and drink at a place called

35:48.798 --> 35:51.236
Sun of a Beach.

35:51.279 --> 35:53.455
Eh, their drinks are cheap.

35:53.499 --> 35:55.065
They're doing two for ones
every day of the week

35:55.109 --> 35:58.895
-to bring in business.
-That's it?

35:58.939 --> 36:00.767
What do you mean?

36:00.810 --> 36:02.377
Well, I don't know.

36:02.421 --> 36:05.250
Uh, I just can't imagine
customers taking off

36:05.293 --> 36:06.686
over some happy hour
bullshit.

36:06.729 --> 36:08.470
It just doesn't make sense
to me.

36:11.604 --> 36:14.346
What's up?

36:14.389 --> 36:18.176
People shit-talking.

36:18.219 --> 36:20.265
You know, it'll blow over.

36:20.308 --> 36:23.311
No, I don't. What --
What are they talking about?

36:23.355 --> 36:24.791
It's stupid, dude.

36:24.834 --> 36:26.488
It -- It doesn't even
make sense.

36:26.532 --> 36:29.274
Tommy, what are they
talking about?

36:29.317 --> 36:33.365
People are saying that you
and your brothers

36:33.408 --> 36:38.587
"took care" of Adrian.

36:38.631 --> 36:41.677
I mean, I know you said
he's been on that boat trip,

36:41.721 --> 36:44.767
man, but...

36:49.032 --> 36:53.211
But what?

36:53.254 --> 36:54.516
I don't know.

36:54.560 --> 36:57.693
He's -- He's just been gone
awhile now.

37:02.916 --> 37:05.310
Things feel different

37:05.353 --> 37:08.269
since your mom's been gone.

37:22.240 --> 37:25.199
Hey, have you seen two kids?

37:25.243 --> 37:27.549
-What did they look like?
-A boy and a girl.

37:27.593 --> 37:30.509
They -- They have dark hair,
7 years old.

37:30.552 --> 37:34.513
I'm sorry, I-I haven't.
Do you need help?

37:34.556 --> 37:36.863
-Should we call the police?
-No. No, no, no, no.

37:36.906 --> 37:40.345
It's fine.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.141
Hey! Hey!

37:54.184 --> 37:57.405
Excuse me, have you --
have you ladies seen two kids,

37:57.449 --> 38:00.103
brown hair? No?

38:00.147 --> 38:04.107
Andrew, Julia!

38:08.982 --> 38:10.853
Yo, yo, Craig.
What -- What are we doing?

38:10.897 --> 38:13.203
Oh, you're about to find out,
man.

38:13.247 --> 38:16.032
What are we gonna do?

38:16.076 --> 38:17.382
You gonna do something.

38:17.425 --> 38:19.340
No, no, no!

38:19.384 --> 38:20.646
Hey, hey,
you're gonna fall.

38:20.689 --> 38:22.778
What are you --
What are you doing, man?

38:22.822 --> 38:25.085
-Come on, you pussies.
-Dude.

38:25.128 --> 38:28.131
Hey, we're gonna go up there?
Are you gonna get up there?

38:29.829 --> 38:33.006
Dude, no, no!
-It's not that deep, man.
-Let's go.

38:33.049 --> 38:35.138
I don't think that's
a good idea, dude.

38:40.361 --> 38:42.232
Shit's changed, man.

38:46.193 --> 38:48.935
I used to do this shit with
my brothers all the time.

38:48.978 --> 38:50.458
Yo, come on up, man!

38:50.502 --> 38:52.460
-Please clear the pier.
-Shit.

38:52.504 --> 38:54.201
Cops, cops, cops, cops.
Hey, Craig.

38:54.244 --> 38:56.769
Craig, Craig, Craig, Craig,
-Craig.
-No. Come on. Let's go.

38:56.812 --> 38:59.728
Please.
-Let's get out of here.
-Yo! Yo, where are you going?

38:59.772 --> 39:01.382
Right now!
-Hey!

39:01.426 --> 39:03.471
Everyone, move back
to the boardwalk.

39:03.515 --> 39:05.821
Goddamnit.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.652
This is the Oceanside
Harbor Patrol.

39:10.696 --> 39:14.308
Stay where you are.
Stay where you are.

39:14.352 --> 39:17.398
Do not jump.

39:42.336 --> 39:44.686
-Mom!
-Jesus Christ!

39:44.730 --> 39:48.211
Where the hell were you?

39:48.255 --> 39:52.433
I was so worried.

39:59.353 --> 40:02.356
Oh!

40:02.400 --> 40:04.619
What are you doing here?

40:04.663 --> 40:08.536
Andrew called me.

40:08.580 --> 40:10.146
Manny was supposed to be
watching them.

40:10.190 --> 40:15.238
Well, he left. And they went out
looking for you and got lost.

40:15.282 --> 40:16.805
Called me from a pay phone.

40:16.849 --> 40:18.851
Andrew wanted to find you.

40:18.894 --> 40:20.983
He was worried the man
-was gonna hurt you.
-What man?

40:21.027 --> 40:23.246
The man who beat up
Uncle Jake.

40:23.290 --> 40:26.467
Max?

40:26.511 --> 40:29.688
Okay. Hey.

40:29.731 --> 40:33.909
You guys don't have to worry
about him, okay?

40:33.953 --> 40:35.868
Hey, why don't you guys get
ready for bed?

40:35.911 --> 40:37.913
-I don't want to go to bed.
-Come on, come on.

40:37.957 --> 40:39.349
You can take your pizza.

40:39.393 --> 40:41.961
-Good night.
-Here you go.

40:42.004 --> 40:46.661
-Come here.
-Good night, baby.

40:49.534 --> 40:51.187
Good night, Andrew.
Bye, baby.

40:55.670 --> 40:58.456
They shouldn't have
called you.

40:58.499 --> 41:02.503
But I'm here now, so...

41:02.547 --> 41:05.724
-So you can go.
-Janine --

41:05.767 --> 41:07.334
I really don't want a lecture
right now.

41:07.377 --> 41:11.512
I'm not gonna give you one.

41:11.556 --> 41:16.474
Look, shit happens.
It's part of being a mom.

41:16.517 --> 41:19.781
Come on.

41:19.825 --> 41:22.828
You need this more than I do.

41:34.013 --> 41:35.971
A little heavy on the vodka.

41:36.015 --> 41:41.368
Are you complaining?
So Manny just left them?

41:41.411 --> 41:43.892
Yeah, looks that way.

41:45.285 --> 41:47.461
I'd hate to be his ass
when you see him again.

41:55.338 --> 42:00.561
Things come up and you can
always call me.

44:27.447 --> 44:29.275
Okay, what -- what's going on?

44:29.318 --> 44:33.279
I thought you were just too
pussy to hold the coke yourself.

44:33.322 --> 44:36.804
Then some federale shows up at
my door today,

44:36.848 --> 44:38.501
and I start putting
two and two together.

44:38.545 --> 44:39.720
Wait, put what together?
What --

44:39.764 --> 44:41.200
That you were trying
to set me up!

44:41.243 --> 44:42.636
Wait a minute. I don't know
what you're talking about.

44:42.680 --> 44:44.507

44:44.551 --> 44:48.381
What's going on?

44:48.424 --> 44:52.646
DEA.

44:52.690 --> 44:55.475
Livengood.

44:55.518 --> 44:58.217
Oh, shit.

44:58.260 --> 45:00.785
Well, did he find it?

45:00.828 --> 45:03.831
No. And he won't.
I got rid of it.

45:03.875 --> 45:06.442
-What?
-Yeah. It's gone.

45:06.486 --> 45:07.966
I'm not going to federal prison
for your bullshit.

45:08.009 --> 45:09.707
No, no, no.
You could have called me.

45:09.750 --> 45:11.012
You could have told me
about this.

45:11.056 --> 45:12.710
You could have reached out.
I could have moved --

45:12.753 --> 45:13.928
You really want to tell me

45:13.972 --> 45:15.190
what I could
and couldn't do right now?

45:15.234 --> 45:17.018
Hey, hey, listen,
it's not my fault

45:17.062 --> 45:20.021
that you have heat
on you right now.

45:20.065 --> 45:24.591
That's where you're wrong, bro,
is the heat's on you.

45:24.634 --> 45:26.419
What are you talking about?

45:26.462 --> 45:27.986
Yeah.

45:28.029 --> 45:30.336
The only thing these guys
seemed to care about

45:30.379 --> 45:33.165
was Deran.
