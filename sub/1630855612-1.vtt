WEBVTT

00:06.923 --> 00:08.550
Guys, guys, guys,
check it out!

00:08.550 --> 00:11.052
I got the original dartboard
from <i>Cheers</i> on eBay.

00:11.052 --> 00:13.930
It only cost $100,000!
I'm gonna put it up.

00:13.930 --> 00:15.181
Hey, I thought Korvo said

00:15.181 --> 00:16.641
no more throwing metal
in the house

00:16.641 --> 00:18.852
after you got that butter knife
stuck in his eye.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.270
These are famous darts!

00:20.270 --> 00:22.188
Whatever Korvo doesn't know
won't hurt him.

00:22.188 --> 00:23.898
Watch this. Oh, my God!

00:23.898 --> 00:25.150
- Oh shit, Terry.
- You hit Korvo

00:25.150 --> 00:26.276
- in the throat, Terry!
- That had to hurt.

00:26.443 --> 00:27.819
- Oh, my God!
- Right in the throat. Jesus!

00:27.819 --> 00:29.863
Go get the voice-fixing ray.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.990
I'm sorry, big guy. My bad!

00:31.990 --> 00:33.408
We'll get this fixed in a jiffy!

00:37.037 --> 00:38.621
I told you not to throw
metal around here.

00:38.621 --> 00:40.665
We're going to be late to work.
Stop buggering about!

00:41.875 --> 00:43.793
Hey, does Korvo sound
a little off?

00:43.793 --> 00:45.170
This thing must not
be calibrated.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.421
- Let me try again.
- No!

00:46.921 --> 00:49.090
No. This is working for me.

00:49.090 --> 00:51.176
All right, chop chop,
let's get a move on.

00:51.176 --> 00:53.595
I hate being late.
It makes me feel hot and weird.

00:53.595 --> 00:56.014
You make me feel hot and weird.
What was that?

00:56.014 --> 00:57.807
Nothing! Coming, sweetie!

00:58.767 --> 01:01.269
Wait, is his voice just
gonna be like that from now on?

01:01.269 --> 01:03.313
Yeah, but it sounds
pretty much the same to me.

01:03.313 --> 01:04.856
Nobody's gonna notice.

01:08.818 --> 01:11.196
<i>Planet Schlorp was
a perfect utopia</i>

01:11.196 --> 01:13.031
<i>until the asteroid hit.</i>

01:14.032 --> 01:16.326
<i>One hundred adults and
their replicants were issued a Pupa</i>

01:16.326 --> 01:18.161
<i>and escaped into the-- space,</i>

01:18.161 --> 01:20.580
<i>searching for new homes
on uninhabited worlds.</i>

01:21.164 --> 01:22.332
<i>We crashed on Earth,</i>

01:22.332 --> 01:24.250
<i>stranding us on an already
overpopulated planet.</i>

01:24.250 --> 01:25.960
<i>That's right, I've been talking
this whole time.</i>

01:25.960 --> 01:27.170
<i>I'm the one holding the Pupa.</i>

01:27.170 --> 01:28.797
<i>My name's Korvo.
This is my show.</i>

01:28.797 --> 01:30.381
<i>Bollocks, I just dropped
the Pupa!</i>

01:30.381 --> 01:31.716
<i>Oh, this is ridiculous.</i>

01:31.716 --> 01:33.635
<i>I hate Earth.
It's a horrible home.</i>

01:33.635 --> 01:35.011
<i>People are stupid
and confusing.</i>

01:35.011 --> 01:36.429
<i>This is what my voice
sounds like now.</i>

01:36.429 --> 01:38.556
<i>I don't care if it's jarring.
Get over it.</i>

01:38.556 --> 01:40.266
<i>And that voice-changer ray
has chronitons in it</i>

01:40.266 --> 01:41.351
<i>so this is what I'm
going to sound like</i>

01:41.351 --> 01:42.685
<i>in flashbacks too.</i>

01:42.685 --> 01:44.020
<i>You got a problem with that,
then tough shit!</i>

01:44.020 --> 01:45.105
<i>It's called science!</i>

01:52.987 --> 01:54.739
Alright,
fellow Shlorpians, this is it.

01:54.739 --> 01:56.699
The ship is fixed
for real, real.

01:56.699 --> 01:58.910
Finally, we can leave
this piece of shit planet for good.

01:58.910 --> 02:01.079
I know I've said those exact
words multiple times before,

02:01.079 --> 02:02.622
but this time it's actually happening.

02:02.622 --> 02:03.706
Clap. Everyone, clap.

02:06.459 --> 02:08.044
Bravo, Korvo.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.171
You really sacked up
and dragged our sorry asses

02:10.171 --> 02:11.381
across the finish line.

02:11.381 --> 02:14.717
And you put up with so much BS
from us along the way.

02:14.717 --> 02:17.053
Nevertheless, you persisted.

02:17.053 --> 02:19.055
Gotta give it up
for the K man.

02:19.055 --> 02:20.306
K Man feels you, dawg.

02:20.306 --> 02:22.058
Yes, the last few months
have been a bitch,

02:22.058 --> 02:23.476
repairing the ship on weekends,

02:23.476 --> 02:25.270
slogging through that
boring-ass office job

02:25.270 --> 02:27.147
to give the Pupa structure
and normalcy,

02:27.147 --> 02:28.857
but it was worth it,
because he's all better now.

02:28.857 --> 02:30.608
- Right, Pupa?
- Pixar!

02:30.608 --> 02:32.610
Mm, back to terrible
language skills,

02:32.610 --> 02:33.695
just the way I like it.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.280
We pooled our
Skee-Ball tickets

02:35.405 --> 02:36.406
and got you a
little something.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.740
It's a plain T-shirt

02:37.740 --> 02:39.325
with a deep V.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.536
Oh! I always wanted a deep V,

02:41.536 --> 02:42.996
but I never thought I
could pull it off.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.248
Korvo, honey,
you can pull anything off.

02:45.248 --> 02:48.084
Show us that sexy sternum,
baby, oh!

02:48.084 --> 02:50.712
- Whoa.
- Ooh, that's a deep V.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.422
Let's blow this hellhole.

02:54.174 --> 02:59.596
Korvo, Korvo,
Korvo, Korvo, Korvo, Korvo!

03:00.138 --> 03:02.223
Korvo, Korvo!

03:02.223 --> 03:03.892
Are you freaking kidding me?

03:03.892 --> 03:06.394
Sorry, I must
have nodded off.

03:06.394 --> 03:08.438
Were you giving
a presentation or something?

03:08.438 --> 03:10.607
<i>You</i> were giving
a presentation.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.817
Shit, right.
Sorry, I'll continue.

03:12.817 --> 03:14.777
In conclusion, uh,
the leaf report

03:14.777 --> 03:16.487
will be delayed indefinitely.

03:16.487 --> 03:18.156
We commissioned a
$3 million study,

03:18.156 --> 03:19.407
and apparently the leaves are

03:19.407 --> 03:20.658
just sticking to the branches.

03:20.658 --> 03:22.285
All these years, and I guess

03:22.285 --> 03:23.995
global warming wasn't a myth.

03:23.995 --> 03:25.830
If we don't hit our rake
quota this month,

03:25.830 --> 03:27.582
there will have to be cutbacks.

03:27.582 --> 03:28.666
Aw.

03:28.666 --> 03:30.210
Uh, sorry, yeah, just to dig in

03:30.210 --> 03:31.836
and unpack some
of what you said.

03:31.836 --> 03:34.881
Why in the fuck do we
care about rakes?

03:34.881 --> 03:37.592
Because we're a rake company.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.427
Looks like the Solar Opposites

03:39.427 --> 03:41.596
work at a boring rake
company now.

03:45.725 --> 03:47.143
Whoa.

03:50.021 --> 03:52.440
Jesse, Yumyulack, hurry up,
you're gonna miss the bus.

03:53.524 --> 03:54.901
Had to stay up all night

03:54.901 --> 03:57.779
finishing my solar
system diorama for class.

03:57.779 --> 03:58.863
Goddamn science.

03:58.863 --> 04:00.198
Good, we're trying
to be normal,

04:00.198 --> 04:02.116
and that sounds pretty
damn normal if you ask me.

04:02.116 --> 04:03.868
What the fuck are all
these extra planets?

04:03.868 --> 04:06.329
The invisible ones
the humans don't know about yet.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.413
Earth Four,

04:07.413 --> 04:09.958
Megan thee Planet,
and Their-Anus.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.626
We can't tell people
about those.

04:11.626 --> 04:13.002
They're invisible for a reason.

04:13.002 --> 04:14.379
Make a normal solar system.

04:14.545 --> 04:16.047
Tuna fish and carrot
sticks again?

04:16.214 --> 04:17.674
Ah, this shit nasty.

04:17.674 --> 04:18.841
It's a normal lunch.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.385
The only other option
is acorn butter.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.678
All the other nuts
are off the table.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.638
Screw those kids with
nut allergies.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.515
It should be survival
of the fittest.

04:25.515 --> 04:27.141
No killing your classmates.

04:27.141 --> 04:29.227
We have to keep it basic AF
for the Pupa.

04:29.227 --> 04:30.395
Look how happy he is

04:30.395 --> 04:32.272
with his totally normal
enrichment activity.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.565
Our miserable lives
are giving him structure.

04:34.565 --> 04:35.733
You don't want him turning back

04:35.733 --> 04:37.318
into a steam of teen
angst again, do you?

04:37.318 --> 04:39.028
Like that whole thing
that was a big deal

04:39.028 --> 04:40.405
at the end of last year, remember?

04:40.405 --> 04:41.906
- No, thank you.
- No, that fucking sucked.

04:41.906 --> 04:43.491
Then go have a normal
day at school.

04:43.491 --> 04:44.659
Stay the course.

04:44.909 --> 04:46.119
Terry, let's go.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.745
Sorry, I woke up with
a case of the Wednesdays,

04:47.745 --> 04:48.830
and it's only Monday.

04:48.830 --> 04:49.956
We can't be late.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.249
Mr. Sarner's starting to suspect

04:51.249 --> 04:52.375
I'm not in it for the rakes.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.210
Man, Sarner is such
a dick brain.

04:54.210 --> 04:55.461
You'd be a way better
boss than him.

04:55.461 --> 04:56.754
Yeah, no duh.

04:56.754 --> 04:58.381
That fool's lucky I'm
being normal AFF,

04:58.381 --> 04:59.841
or I'd have usurped
his ass already.

04:59.841 --> 05:01.592
Yeah, usurp that shit, Korvo.

05:01.592 --> 05:03.761
Whoa!
- Yeah, buddy.

05:03.761 --> 05:05.221
- Little Buddy.
- Oh. Hey.

05:07.181 --> 05:08.308
Damn, you see that?

05:08.308 --> 05:09.392
Little Buddy and Pupa

05:09.392 --> 05:10.685
were cold AF to each other.

05:10.685 --> 05:12.937
I'm, I'm sorry,
I'm using "AF" way too much.

05:12.937 --> 05:14.147
I kinda can't quit.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.565
- They must've had a falling out.
- AF.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.317
Oh, maybe that little fucker
will move out soon.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.484
I sure as shit hope so.

05:18.484 --> 05:19.819
When we met him,
I thought he'd be like

05:19.944 --> 05:21.154
this whole reoccurring thing,

05:21.279 --> 05:23.239
but now he just feels
like a remnant.

05:23.906 --> 05:25.783
- Oh.
- Oh, my lord.

05:25.783 --> 05:28.411
Why the fuck
are you walking arm-in-arm?

05:28.411 --> 05:30.163
Are you, like, dating?

05:30.163 --> 05:31.748
No, she's my co-replicant.

05:31.748 --> 05:34.000
They're totally dating, gross.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.209
They're like <i>Oldboy.</i>

05:35.209 --> 05:37.086
Na-uh, we're just using
nutrient parts

05:37.086 --> 05:39.839
in our elbows to exchange
information. Look.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.217
Ew.
- You're not supposed to

05:43.217 --> 05:45.470
exchange juices
with your brother.

05:45.470 --> 05:46.679
This is totally normal.

05:46.679 --> 05:48.556
As if. It's fucking freaky.

05:48.556 --> 05:49.640
Elbow fuckers!

05:49.640 --> 05:50.725
Look, everyone.

05:50.725 --> 05:52.018
They fuck elbows.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.478
- They fuck elbows, everybody.
- Ah, man,

05:53.478 --> 05:54.896
I didn't know we were weird.

05:54.896 --> 05:57.482
Maybe we should stop
porting in public for a while.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.150
No, we need to stop
hanging out entirely.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.568
We're radioactive right now.

06:00.568 --> 06:02.445
This "elbow fucker"
thing's got legs. I can tell.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.280
It does have a ring to it.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.532
But we could still
hang out, right?

06:07.200 --> 06:08.201
Yum?

06:09.369 --> 06:11.079
Ah geez.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.461
Reset my email password again?

06:18.461 --> 06:19.712
No, I'm not doing it.

06:19.712 --> 06:20.880
Nobody's going to guess

06:20.880 --> 06:23.674
"National dash Lampoons
dash VanPassword69."

06:23.674 --> 06:25.176
Janice is driving me crazy.

06:25.176 --> 06:27.929
She's told me the same joke
every day for two weeks.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.806
Ugh, it's like one
of those long,

06:29.806 --> 06:31.265
elaborate non-joke jokes,

06:31.265 --> 06:32.767
like the humor of Maria Bamford.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.685
And it always ends with her
crying about her husband

06:34.685 --> 06:36.270
getting hit by a car a year ago.

06:36.270 --> 06:37.855
Terry, I don't think
that's a joke.

06:37.855 --> 06:38.940
That's what I'm saying.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.400
I'm sick of forcing out
a fake laugh

06:40.400 --> 06:41.943
every time she cradles
a wedding photo.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.444
It's uncomfortable.
It's not even funny.

06:43.444 --> 06:45.029
Let's take a walk
to the Coffee Bean

06:45.029 --> 06:46.155
and get you a flat black.

06:46.155 --> 06:47.240
That always calms you down.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.574
Enough with the bits, Janice!

06:48.574 --> 06:49.784
You're not Maria Bamford!

06:51.327 --> 06:53.079
Jesse, you want us
to break you off a piece

06:53.079 --> 06:55.081
of this acorn butter cracker
that we're all sharing?

06:55.373 --> 06:56.582
Sure, I'll take a shard.

06:56.582 --> 06:58.418
Hey, thanks for letting
me sit with you.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.378
We heard you stopped
hanging out with your little brother.

07:00.378 --> 07:02.380
Betraying family is, like,
mega cool.

07:02.380 --> 07:03.965
That was weird when
you guys used to jizz

07:03.965 --> 07:05.341
into each other's elbows.

07:05.341 --> 07:08.094
Well, Yumyulack and I
don't do that anymore,

07:08.094 --> 07:09.512
or talk or think
about each other

07:09.512 --> 07:10.805
every second of the day.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.390
- That's for sure.
- There's nothing better

07:12.390 --> 07:13.975
than fucking with
your little brother.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.226
Oh, okay.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.061
I didn't know that was
a thing that was done.

07:17.061 --> 07:18.813
Oh yeah. I put a GoPro

07:18.813 --> 07:20.690
in a 10-gallon hat
and live-streamed

07:20.690 --> 07:23.359
my little brother Conner
straightening his pubes.

07:23.359 --> 07:25.361
It fucking ruined him.

07:25.361 --> 07:27.447
He had to move in
with Gramgram in Sweden.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.450
That feels a tad harsh,
but I am still learning

07:30.450 --> 07:32.577
what a normal sibling
relationship looks like.

07:32.577 --> 07:34.495
It looks like hiding
a gram of crystal meth

07:34.495 --> 07:35.830
in my brother's locker.

07:35.830 --> 07:38.207
He goes to school in jail now.

07:38.207 --> 07:40.460
So how are you gonna fuck
with Yumyulack?

07:40.460 --> 07:42.879
I don't know.
The bar seems really high.

07:42.879 --> 07:45.798
Oh, my God, you should do it
at the Above the Sea dance.

07:45.798 --> 07:47.341
Fuck yeah. Humiliate
that chode

07:47.341 --> 07:49.051
in front of all of
his new friends.

07:49.051 --> 07:50.678
If he even has any.

07:51.762 --> 07:53.264
Good one, Jesse.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.145
I'm so glad I found my tribe.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.022
Is this the normal vibe in here?

08:01.022 --> 08:02.648
Yeah, we mostly chain smoke,

08:02.648 --> 08:04.901
count down the days
until our pension kicks in,

08:04.901 --> 08:06.819
and do impressions of
the dumber students.

08:07.195 --> 08:08.696
"Dur, I'm Greg Simmons.

08:08.696 --> 08:10.156
"I shot a load in my pants

08:10.156 --> 08:12.158
watching <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>
in class."

08:15.536 --> 08:17.413
For last period, we're just
gonna put on <i>Seabiscuit</i>

08:17.413 --> 08:19.540
and duck out to Islands
for Mahalo Hour.

08:19.540 --> 08:20.625
Hell yeah, dawg.

08:20.625 --> 08:21.792
Last one there buys me

08:21.792 --> 08:23.377
a Big Island Ice Tea.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.301
Mm, I do love pebble ice.
What are you doing?

08:30.301 --> 08:31.886
I'm making it take
as long as possible

08:31.886 --> 08:33.721
to get back to the office.

08:33.721 --> 08:35.473
That's how much I hate it there, Korvo.
I'd rather be in the elevator.

08:35.473 --> 08:36.933
I guess we just have
to accept the fact

08:36.933 --> 08:38.100
that work is boring.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.519
There's absolutely
no way around it.

08:44.941 --> 08:45.942
Suck it.

08:49.654 --> 08:50.738
Hey, a little help.

08:50.738 --> 08:52.406
Whoa, what is that?

08:52.406 --> 08:53.491
It's ping pong.

08:53.491 --> 08:55.076
Ping ping.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.161
And this is a place
of business?

08:57.161 --> 08:59.872
Oh yeah. We're a call center
for Bed, Bath, and Beyond.

08:59.872 --> 09:02.917
Oof, that sounds like
the most boring AF job there is.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.836
Used to be, until our boss
bought us this sweet-ass table.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.380
Your boss got this for you?

09:07.380 --> 09:10.091
The ping ping table is
an official part of the office?

09:10.091 --> 09:11.676
Oh yeah, this job rules.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.886
- Ping ping!
- Ping ping!

09:13.886 --> 09:15.805
- Look, the fact is--
- Get off the phone.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.640
Terry and I have found a way
to solve our problems.

09:17.640 --> 09:18.891
What problems?

09:18.891 --> 09:21.310
We just need one
super-important thing from you.

09:21.310 --> 09:23.062
Drum roll, please.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.897
Who are these kids?

09:24.897 --> 09:27.066
- How did--
- Buy the office a ping ping table.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.485
No.

09:29.485 --> 09:31.028
Get the fuck out.
If we don't get the table,

09:31.028 --> 09:32.321
you don't get paid.

09:34.323 --> 09:36.659
Guys, that was an
important call.

09:36.659 --> 09:37.910
Here's the tea, Sarner,

09:37.910 --> 09:39.287
the workplace environment
you created

09:39.287 --> 09:40.538
fucking sucks.

09:40.538 --> 09:41.789
Our research shows the vibe

09:41.789 --> 09:42.999
is better at other offices,

09:42.999 --> 09:45.167
offices with ping ping.

09:45.167 --> 09:47.211
A ping pong table
would be too disruptive.

09:47.211 --> 09:48.713
- It is not happening.
- Well, Terry,

09:48.713 --> 09:50.590
I think Mr. Sarner
has been clear and--

09:50.590 --> 09:52.633
We measured out a perfect spot
for it in the boiler room.

09:52.883 --> 09:54.927
You shouldn't be going down
to the boiler room.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.304
It's extremely dangerous.

09:56.304 --> 09:57.388
Uh, Wendy?

09:57.388 --> 09:59.473
Hi, so sorry we got disconnected.

10:00.349 --> 10:01.642
Korvo, my dude, why the fuck

10:01.642 --> 10:02.893
didn't you have
my back in there?

10:02.893 --> 10:04.186
I know how we get
the ping ping,

10:04.186 --> 10:05.896
but it will require
some high-level scheming.

10:05.896 --> 10:07.064
Come on.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.235
Aisha, bring up the scheming set

10:11.235 --> 10:12.862
where we like
to smoke and scheme.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.448
<i>Wow, no, "Hi, Aisha.
How's your day going?"</i>

10:15.448 --> 10:16.532
<i>Just right to business.</i>

10:16.532 --> 10:17.783
You know I love you.
I'm sorry.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.327
<i>Are you sorry 'cause
you're sorry</i>

10:19.327 --> 10:21.078
<i>or because I called you out
on your bullshit?</i>

10:21.078 --> 10:22.163
Both.

10:23.039 --> 10:26.167
Oh, oh, oh, I'm gonna slip
into something more schemable.

10:28.628 --> 10:29.962
That turd has zero clue

10:29.962 --> 10:31.672
how to make his employees
feel valued.

10:31.672 --> 10:33.883
If you were the boss,
a rad ping ping table would be

10:33.883 --> 10:35.468
your first purchase.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.887
No shit, but that's not
the world we live in,

10:37.887 --> 10:40.222
- so we fight.
- Whoa, deep V, huh?

10:40.222 --> 10:42.350
Don't make fun of me.
I'm feeling insecure about it.

10:42.350 --> 10:43.643
No, I love it.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.311
Especially once your chest
gets more defined.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.937
Sorry, continue scheming.

10:46.937 --> 10:48.189
Sarner said we're
the only employees

10:48.189 --> 10:49.273
who want ping ping.

10:49.273 --> 10:50.733
But if we can prove
our co-workers

10:50.733 --> 10:52.068
also demand ping ping,

10:52.068 --> 10:54.111
then he'll be boxed in
by his own logic.

10:54.111 --> 10:56.656
Ah, but everyone
in the office is a sleemo.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.324
I made a list of our
stupidest co-workers

10:58.324 --> 10:59.492
with the most friends.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.035
If we can get them supporting
ping ping,

11:01.035 --> 11:02.912
the rest will fall in line.

11:02.912 --> 11:05.289
But everyone hates slash is jealous slash
wants to sleep with me of us.

11:05.289 --> 11:06.707
Then we motivate them.

11:08.584 --> 11:10.336
<i>First on the list is Doug.</i>

11:10.336 --> 11:12.046
<i>He's always talking
about how much he loves</i>

11:12.046 --> 11:14.090
<i>vintage Shaquille O'Neal
Mr. Big bars.</i>

11:16.801 --> 11:17.843
<i>Pim and Jam,</i>

11:17.843 --> 11:19.053
<i>clearly in love with
each other,</i>

11:19.053 --> 11:20.846
<i>but Jam has a stupid boyfriend
nobody likes,</i>

11:20.846 --> 11:22.973
<i>and Pim's too dopey
to do anything about it.</i>

11:22.973 --> 11:25.309
<i>All she needs is a little push.</i>

11:25.309 --> 11:26.519
I can't believe my boyfriend

11:26.519 --> 11:28.604
would cheat on me with
this ugly whore.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.317
<i>Then there's big,
stupid Janice.</i>

11:33.317 --> 11:34.735
<i>And we all know that
boring biatch</i>

11:34.735 --> 11:36.487
<i>only cares about one thing.</i>

11:36.862 --> 11:38.114
This is the man who
killed your husband

11:38.114 --> 11:39.824
in that hit-and-run
two summers ago.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.325
Sign our petition
and he's yours.

11:41.325 --> 11:43.661
That's right,
I did it and I'd do it again.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.837
Game, set, match, Sarner.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.505
Those are ping ping words.

11:54.505 --> 11:55.881
In your hands is a petition

11:55.881 --> 11:57.508
signed by everyone
in the office.

11:57.508 --> 12:00.428
The message is clear,
your workers demand the ping.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.179
The answer is still no.

12:02.179 --> 12:04.640
Fuck you. You said we were
the only ones who wanted ping ping

12:04.640 --> 12:06.434
and I've trapped you
with your own words.

12:06.434 --> 12:07.768
Your whole argument
has collapsed.

12:07.768 --> 12:09.270
It doesn't matter.

12:09.270 --> 12:11.313
I'm meeting with the board
of directors tomorrow evening,

12:11.313 --> 12:13.315
and they're doing
a full audit of our expenses.

12:13.315 --> 12:14.984
And if they don't like
what they see,

12:14.984 --> 12:16.861
they're gonna shut
down this branch.

12:16.861 --> 12:19.488
There's no way I can justify
a ping pong table to them,

12:19.488 --> 12:22.658
and I already told you it is
not safe in the boiler room.

12:22.658 --> 12:24.702
Now get out of my office!

12:27.455 --> 12:29.248
<i>You are so close, Pupa.</i>

12:29.248 --> 12:30.332
<i>You want a hint?</i>

12:31.417 --> 12:32.501
Aisha, quick question.

12:32.793 --> 12:34.336
Uh, where's the Phallic
Multiplier?

12:34.336 --> 12:36.213
<i>Girl, what do you need
the dick ray for?</i>

12:36.213 --> 12:37.923
My big-sister prank.

12:37.923 --> 12:40.217
I'm gonna cover Yumyulack in
dicks at the Above the Sea dance.

12:40.217 --> 12:42.052
<i>You can't humiliate
Yumyulack like that.</i>

12:42.052 --> 12:43.387
<i>He's an incel fuckface.</i>

12:43.387 --> 12:46.140
Ha, if anything,
I'm going easy on the kid.

12:46.140 --> 12:48.517
You should hear what
the Stacis do to their little bros.

12:48.517 --> 12:51.937
<i>Trust is the key thing
to keep your elbow port open and flowing.</i>

12:51.937 --> 12:53.647
<i>Without it, they'll
close up forever,</i>

12:53.647 --> 12:54.732
<i>like a earring hole.</i>

12:54.732 --> 12:56.150
Forever?

12:56.150 --> 12:58.027
How come this is the first
I'm hearing about this now?

13:00.196 --> 13:02.782
Fuck you, Jesse.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.074
Stupid alien.

13:05.117 --> 13:08.078
I'm gonna need that
dick ray ASAP.

13:11.916 --> 13:14.210
<i>They're teens.
You gotta let them make mistakes.</i>

13:47.326 --> 13:49.245
You two, come with me.

13:52.540 --> 13:55.626
I did a lot of thinking
about what you said, and--

13:56.836 --> 13:58.629
Sarner, you beautiful bastard.

13:58.629 --> 13:59.713
You got the ping ping.

13:59.713 --> 14:00.923
But the board of directors.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.258
You said you couldn't
justify it.

14:02.258 --> 14:03.676
Don't worry about the board.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.761
I know the perfect thing to say
to get them to sign off.

14:05.761 --> 14:07.721
But I do have one condition.

14:07.721 --> 14:09.598
- I get the first game.
- Deal.

14:09.598 --> 14:11.934
Wow, in the end,
you actually are a pretty good guy.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.727
Hey, working with you two

14:13.727 --> 14:15.688
- makes it easy to be good.
- Oh!

14:16.438 --> 14:18.232
Jesus Christ!

14:18.232 --> 14:19.733
Whoa, Sarner was right.

14:19.733 --> 14:21.735
The boiler room is
hella dangerous.

14:22.111 --> 14:23.821
I mean, for him, not us.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.656
So I guess we were both right.

14:29.243 --> 14:31.078
Let's go over the plan.

14:31.078 --> 14:32.621
It's all going down when
Principal Cooke

14:32.621 --> 14:34.039
presents the Student Awards.

14:34.039 --> 14:36.500
We convinced everyone
to vote Yumyulack

14:36.500 --> 14:37.918
for Most Improved Body.

14:37.918 --> 14:40.170
And when he goes
on stage to accept--

14:40.170 --> 14:44.425
I suffocate him in shlongs
like a normal big sister.

14:46.051 --> 14:47.344
- I see his brain.
- We are so fucked.

14:47.344 --> 14:48.429
- I see his fucking brain.
- We are so fucked.

14:48.429 --> 14:49.555
What do we do? What do we do?

14:49.555 --> 14:50.681
<i>What kinda sitcom plot</i>

14:50.681 --> 14:51.974
<i>you all devising this time?</i>

14:51.974 --> 14:53.809
We're in a tight spot, Aisha.
In a few hours,

14:53.809 --> 14:56.312
the board of directors
is expecting to meet with Mr. Sarner.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.898
<i>And that's his dead ass
over there on my Pretendo-deck?</i>

14:58.898 --> 15:01.233
Yes, and now the board will take
our ping ping table away

15:01.233 --> 15:03.736
because Sarner won't be there
to say the perfect thing to justify it.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.821
Ah, I haven't even
gotten to play yet.

15:05.821 --> 15:07.823
<i>Why don't y'all just
bring the dude back to life</i>

15:07.823 --> 15:09.408
<i>so he can talk
to the board himself?</i>

15:09.408 --> 15:10.701
<i>You know I got a whole sleeve</i>

15:10.701 --> 15:12.119
<i>of those Resurrection
Pellets, right?</i>

15:12.119 --> 15:13.954
But wouldn't it jeopardize
the Pupa's progress

15:13.954 --> 15:15.289
to use sci-fi like that?

15:15.289 --> 15:16.999
<i>I mean, it's just one
little pellet.</i>

15:16.999 --> 15:18.417
Yeah, I'm cool with that.
Korvo?

15:18.417 --> 15:20.753
I too accept this rationalization.

15:22.463 --> 15:23.881
Mm, yummy.

15:23.881 --> 15:25.883
Chew it up good.
Yum, yum, yum.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.009
Ah, fuck!

15:27.968 --> 15:30.054
Oh shit, can I get
another pellet?

15:30.054 --> 15:31.555
Classic.

15:31.555 --> 15:34.725
And in the category
Most Likely to Be a Narc,

15:34.725 --> 15:38.771
you, the students,
voted for Rick Blaze.

15:39.855 --> 15:42.942
Rick was also voted
Best Rebounder.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.026
Here's another trophy.

15:44.026 --> 15:46.654
Congrats, Detective... Rick.

15:46.654 --> 15:47.947
Uh, just Rick.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.366
And now, an award
we should probably stop doing...

15:51.450 --> 15:53.869
Most Improved Body.

15:53.869 --> 15:56.330
And the winner is Yumyulack.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.207
Oh, my God!

15:58.415 --> 15:59.667
Thank you!

15:59.667 --> 16:02.252
I, I didn't even know
this body could be improved.

16:23.482 --> 16:26.568
They should be growing and thriving
like the rest of the crowd.

16:26.568 --> 16:28.779
What's wrong with these two?

16:28.779 --> 16:31.448
Hmm, I have one more idea.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.791
I can't do it!

16:40.791 --> 16:43.210
I knew you were
a fake-ass Staci.

16:43.210 --> 16:44.294
Give me that.

16:44.294 --> 16:45.796
I'll do it myself.

16:49.425 --> 16:50.592
Ah, no!

16:50.592 --> 16:54.054
I'm fucking covered in dicks
years too early!

16:54.054 --> 16:55.806
What just happened?

16:55.806 --> 16:57.224
The Stacis wanted
me to prank you,

16:57.224 --> 16:58.475
but it just didn't feel right.

16:58.475 --> 17:00.060
We've always had each
other's backs

17:00.060 --> 17:01.854
and I'm not gonna stop now.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.397
Oh, uh, thanks.

17:03.397 --> 17:07.276
And the award for Best Bow
goes to Jesse.

17:07.276 --> 17:09.695
Me? Aw, you guys noticed.

17:09.695 --> 17:10.779
Don't!

17:10.779 --> 17:11.864
Why not?

17:12.573 --> 17:15.200
Is that an Ewok log trap?

17:15.200 --> 17:16.827
Me and the teachers
set those logs up

17:16.827 --> 17:19.580
to smash your head like an AT-ST
when you accepted Best Bow.

17:19.580 --> 17:20.706
It was their idea.

17:20.706 --> 17:22.166
Thanks for not going
through with it.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.334
Looks like you guys
worked really hard on that.

17:24.334 --> 17:26.128
The trick is to hoist
it as one big log

17:26.128 --> 17:27.504
and then cut it in half.

17:27.504 --> 17:29.506
Oh yeah, that's thinking
with your head.

17:29.506 --> 17:32.384
You are never getting drunk
with us at Islands again.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.094
We thought you were one of us.

17:34.094 --> 17:35.179
Well, I'm not.

17:35.179 --> 17:36.889
I'm a Shlorpian.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.683
And the winner for Best
Trombone Player,

17:39.683 --> 17:41.852
Billy Hosenberg.

17:45.606 --> 17:48.901
Alright, I guess the award goes
to Jackie Quilbard.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.819
Fuck yes, I did it!

17:50.819 --> 17:52.738
Looking snazzy, Mr. Sarner.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.323
I have a body.

17:54.323 --> 17:56.408
Fucking hell. Yes, we brought
you back to life.

17:56.408 --> 17:58.535
I was floating in
the eternal glow

17:58.535 --> 17:59.828
for a million years.

17:59.828 --> 18:01.288
Safe, warm.

18:01.288 --> 18:02.664
You need to remember
what you were going

18:02.664 --> 18:03.874
to say to the board of directors

18:03.874 --> 18:06.085
to justify expensing
a ping ping table.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.920
I've been here before.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.880
I've made some flashcards
to help jog your memory.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.591
"Ping ping increases
productivity by 50 percent."

18:12.591 --> 18:14.426
I mean, that's bullshit,
but let's see if it flies.

18:14.426 --> 18:16.595
How did I get back
on this plane of existence?

18:16.595 --> 18:17.763
Would you shut up?

18:17.763 --> 18:19.223
Literally no one has
ever cared about

18:19.223 --> 18:20.307
what happens after you die.

18:20.307 --> 18:21.433
The board is here.

18:21.433 --> 18:22.643
I need more time, Terry.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.645
Sarner's being a baby
about his resurrection.

18:24.645 --> 18:26.772
I traversed the
black mountain.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.524
Why am I back?

18:28.524 --> 18:29.691
Okay, I'll just have
to stall them

18:29.691 --> 18:30.943
with the old razzle-dazzle.

18:33.362 --> 18:34.988
Where's Sarner?
We don't have all day.

18:34.988 --> 18:36.657
We're members of the board.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.283
He's on his way.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.160
But first, he wanted
me to pop in

18:40.160 --> 18:42.329
and give a brief preamble.

18:42.329 --> 18:44.331
Rakes, where do they come from?

18:44.331 --> 18:45.499
How do we make them?

18:45.499 --> 18:46.583
When you think about it,

18:46.583 --> 18:50.712
a rake is just a big
fork for leaves.

18:50.712 --> 18:52.673
Which leads me to
my next question.

18:52.673 --> 18:55.217
Aren't we just a salad
company for lawns?

18:55.217 --> 18:56.927
What the hell are
you rambling about?

18:56.927 --> 18:58.720
Oh, look at this guy.
You probably need one of these

18:58.720 --> 19:00.097
to comb your hair, am I right?

19:01.682 --> 19:03.600
Alright, you got me.
You got me.

19:04.852 --> 19:07.688
Sarner, so glad
you could finally join us.

19:07.688 --> 19:10.023
I am eternity made finite!

19:12.276 --> 19:14.069
He's, uh, referencing <i>Dune.</i>

19:14.069 --> 19:15.571
The board reviewed your books,

19:15.571 --> 19:17.614
and I have to say, we're
disappointed.

19:17.614 --> 19:19.324
I can't be here!

19:19.324 --> 19:20.868
Don't play for sympathy.

19:20.868 --> 19:23.328
You promised to cut expenses,
but yesterday,

19:23.328 --> 19:26.123
you bought a ping pong table
on the company card.

19:26.123 --> 19:27.708
We are all made of light,

19:27.708 --> 19:29.251
and to that light
I shall return!

19:31.587 --> 19:32.671
I knew I should've brought

19:32.671 --> 19:33.797
a couple of extra pellets.

19:35.424 --> 19:38.218
Everyone's laughing at us,
but I don't even care.

19:38.218 --> 19:39.595
Fuck 'em. This is our normal.

19:39.595 --> 19:42.181
If the other kids knew
what this connection felt like,

19:42.181 --> 19:44.391
maybe they wouldn't
be so judgmental.

19:47.269 --> 19:48.437
Ooh.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.526
Ah.

20:00.365 --> 20:01.450
Ah, yeah.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.209
You don't think those cops
will piece together

20:10.209 --> 20:11.376
what really happened
to Sarner, do you?

20:11.376 --> 20:12.502
Fuckin' hope not.

20:12.502 --> 20:13.921
We can't give the Pupa
a normal life

20:13.921 --> 20:15.631
if we're convicted of
felony manslaughter.

20:15.631 --> 20:18.258
Well, whatever comes,
we'll get through it, together.

20:18.258 --> 20:21.220
The cops are gone. We explained that
the pressure of the rake industry

20:21.220 --> 20:23.680
was too much for Sarner,
and he killed himself out of weakness.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.182
Yes, Sarner was a coward,

20:25.182 --> 20:27.017
and no one should investigate
any aliens.

20:27.017 --> 20:29.144
Agreed.
We think under new leadership,

20:29.144 --> 20:31.355
this branch could really
turn itself around.

20:31.355 --> 20:32.606
I'd love to throw my hat in.

20:32.606 --> 20:34.566
Terry, we liked your
panicked ad-libbing

20:34.566 --> 20:36.235
when you were stalling
us earlier.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.695
How would you like to be
the new branch manager?

20:38.695 --> 20:40.656
Me, the boss?

20:40.656 --> 20:42.157
Fuck yes.

20:42.157 --> 20:44.534
Great, let's get blasted
at Islands to celebrate.

20:44.534 --> 20:46.245
But, but...
But, Terry, I was gonna--

20:46.245 --> 20:47.996
Your first order of business
will be to get rid

20:47.996 --> 20:49.831
of that godawful
ping pong table.

20:49.831 --> 20:51.833
Yeah, you're on point, Wendy.
It's way too disruptive.

20:51.833 --> 20:53.168
Korvo, trash that thing
while I'm out.

20:53.168 --> 20:54.920
But I wanted to come
with you guys.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.965
No, that's an official order
from your boss.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.759
That's right, from now on,
I'm the boss, baby.

21:00.759 --> 21:03.428
Well, not the Boss Baby,
but I am your boss, baby.

21:03.428 --> 21:05.264
Fuck, now I want
a bottle of milk, damn it.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.474
Someone get me some milk
because I'm the fucking boss, baby.

21:09.685 --> 21:12.062
I love this company!
