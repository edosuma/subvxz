WEBVTT

00:02.878 --> 00:04.713
Is that me?

00:04.713 --> 00:06.507
Did I stab someone?

00:06.507 --> 00:08.717
<i>The person on the train,
was it Glitter Guy?</i>

00:08.717 --> 00:11.220
He took my bag. Is this his?

00:11.220 --> 00:13.430
I need to get to Coney Island now.

00:13.430 --> 00:17.184
- We got back the DNA tests
we took for Henry's school project.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.937
- Am I nervous that my son
isn't my son? Not at all.

00:19.937 --> 00:22.231
- You know, I really came here
because I'm worried about you.

00:22.231 --> 00:23.482
- You don't have to worry about me.
- I do.

00:23.482 --> 00:26.026
There is some real shit
going on in this building, Charles.

00:27.819 --> 00:30.072
<i>I need information on who that guy is.</i>

00:30.072 --> 00:31.198
<i>Something to jog my memory.</i>

00:36.703 --> 00:38.622
<i>When I found that Glitter Guy,</i>

00:38.622 --> 00:40.290
<i>he had this on him.</i>

00:41.041 --> 00:43.043
- Hey. Where are you?

00:43.043 --> 00:44.253
- Lucy! Where are you?

00:44.253 --> 00:45.629
- I'm at your place.
- Listen, you need--

00:45.629 --> 00:46.630
- I came to see you.

00:46.630 --> 00:48.799
- Lucy!
- Oh, I know this.

00:48.799 --> 00:51.218
We've got a blackout, people.

00:56.765 --> 01:00.310
<i>New York does crime fast and furious.</i>

01:00.310 --> 01:03.063
<i>Every day brings
a new sensational headline.</i>

01:03.063 --> 01:06.692
<i>"Heiress Found Murdered
in Own Doll Collection."</i>

01:06.692 --> 01:10.529
<i>"Man Mauled by Ex-wife's
Pet Leopard in Bronx Apartment."</i>

01:11.154 --> 01:14.366
<i>After a while, they can
all start to blend together.</i>

01:14.366 --> 01:15.993
<i>But sometimes,</i>

01:15.993 --> 01:18.036
<i>a killer stands out,</i>

01:18.036 --> 01:19.329
<i>makes his mark in history.</i>

01:19.997 --> 01:22.416
- Five entire episodes of vamping.

01:22.416 --> 01:25.127
- At this rate, the cops are gonna
solve it before they do.

01:25.127 --> 01:29.089
- I wish you people would take
my Sixth Avenue Slasher theory seriously.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.466
Marv, we gave you an entire
episode of the fancast

01:31.466 --> 01:33.886
to make your
serial killer-kills-Bunny case.

01:33.886 --> 01:37.055
- It didn't take. No one buys it. Move on.

01:37.055 --> 01:38.974
- He's real.

01:38.974 --> 01:40.184
And he's out there.
Look,

01:40.184 --> 01:41.518
I don't know if I'm totally ready

01:41.518 --> 01:44.479
to just cut and run from <i>Only Murders</i>,
but I have been playing the field.

01:44.479 --> 01:47.649
Have you heard episode one of
that political embezzlement podcast?

01:47.649 --> 01:50.652
- <i>Take the Money and Run.</i>
I didn't hate it.

01:50.652 --> 01:53.238
- It has potential,
if it can get a body count going.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.615
- Embezzlement?

01:55.073 --> 01:57.910
How can you talk about
switching allegiance

01:57.910 --> 01:59.870
when our guys are still
in the middle of season two?

01:59.870 --> 02:02.706
- Face it, Marv.
They're overboard and treading water.

02:02.706 --> 02:04.499
If we cling to them too hard,

02:04.499 --> 02:06.835
they might just drag us down with them.

02:08.003 --> 02:10.005
- Hey! Hi!

02:12.132 --> 02:13.842
- Look at them. Huh?

02:16.929 --> 02:19.348
You guys might be fair-weather fans,

02:19.348 --> 02:22.809
but I am OMITB...
for life.

02:28.607 --> 02:30.400
- What's gotten into him lately?

02:30.400 --> 02:32.736
- When he looked at that fork,
I was scared for my life.

02:32.736 --> 02:35.656
<i>The Sixth Avenue Slasher earned a place</i>

02:35.656 --> 02:37.533
<i>in the headlines of the early aughts.</i>

02:37.533 --> 02:40.953
<i>He killed for years,
always picking victims</i>

02:40.953 --> 02:43.539
<i>who lived on Sixth Avenue.</i>

02:43.539 --> 02:45.374
<i>Or near Sixth Avenue.</i>

02:45.374 --> 02:47.125
<i>And a few times Seventh or Eighth.</i>

02:47.125 --> 02:49.253
<i>Or Broadway or Amsterdam.</i>

02:49.253 --> 02:52.506
<i>Honestly, the whole Big Apple
was his hunting ground.</i>

02:52.506 --> 02:54.925
<i>No one on any street was safe.</i>

02:54.925 --> 02:58.053
<i>Except people on Third.
They seemed to be fine.</i>

02:58.053 --> 02:59.888
<i>And he was never caught.</i>

02:59.888 --> 03:01.890
- Lucy! Where are you?
- <i>For all we know,</i>

03:01.890 --> 03:03.225
<i>he's back at it again.</i>

03:06.311 --> 03:07.521
- We have a blackout, people.

03:07.521 --> 03:10.107
- We need to get to Lucy.
She's at my place all alone.

03:10.107 --> 03:12.150
If the killer is after her...
Wait.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.527
Lucy?

03:13.527 --> 03:15.320
Your semi-stepdaughter?

03:15.320 --> 03:17.406
- Not now, Marv. We're in crisis mode.

03:17.406 --> 03:18.866
- Is the whole city blacked out?

03:18.866 --> 03:20.701
The eastern grid probably went down.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.578
- Maybe they just blew
a fuse in the kitchen.

03:22.578 --> 03:23.996
I had a complicated order.

03:23.996 --> 03:26.123
- Message from ConEd.

03:26.123 --> 03:27.708
Whole tristate area is out!

03:27.708 --> 03:30.127
- See? I do know what
I'm talking about sometimes.

03:30.127 --> 03:32.171
- I don't have service.
Does anyone have service?

03:32.171 --> 03:34.381
- I have service. I just got an email.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.341
Oh my god. It's my DNA results.

03:36.341 --> 03:39.052
Click here to get the answer
you've been waiting for all your life.

03:39.052 --> 03:42.222
I'm clicking. I'm clicking.
It won't load. Fucking hell!

03:42.222 --> 03:43.599
- Cell towers will be jammed.

03:43.599 --> 03:46.393
Everyone trying to connect
with everyone else all at once.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.728
- I hate blackouts.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.522
There's a thin line
between civilization and chaos,

03:50.522 --> 03:52.441
and that line is electricity.

03:52.441 --> 03:53.984
- We have to get to
the Arconia to find Lucy

03:53.984 --> 03:55.986
before anyone else does.
- Can I...

03:56.820 --> 03:59.615
walk you guys through
my Sixth Avenue Slasher theory?

04:00.574 --> 04:03.493
I know you're stuck right now and--
- No time, Marv.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.162
- Yeah, and we're not stuck, okay?

04:06.413 --> 04:10.042
As you can see, we're on fire.
Mr. Putnam, wait!

04:10.042 --> 04:13.170
The fridge is out. These dips,
they're just going to go bad.

04:13.170 --> 04:15.964
No charge, please.
You'd be doing us a favor.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.133
- Oliver, let's go.

04:18.133 --> 04:19.718
- Can I have a doggy bag?

04:19.718 --> 04:21.887
Perhaps a Hefty bag?

05:11.687 --> 05:14.898
<i>The Sixth Avenue Slasher's MO was simple.</i>

05:14.898 --> 05:17.317
<i>Choose older women.</i>

05:17.317 --> 05:19.444
<i>But younger women could be targets, too.</i>

05:19.444 --> 05:21.989
<i>Also, men of all ages.</i>

05:21.989 --> 05:23.156
<i>It really depended on the day.</i>

05:23.991 --> 05:26.660
<i>He scared the city senseless,</i>

05:26.660 --> 05:28.829
<i>and he was never caught.</i>

05:28.829 --> 05:32.666
<i>The only silver lining to having
a serial killer on the loose</i>

05:32.666 --> 05:35.669
<i>is the way it can unite a divided city.</i>

05:35.669 --> 05:39.214
<i>Everyone huddling in their
apartments at the same time,</i>

05:39.214 --> 05:41.717
<i>terrorized by the same psychopath.</i>

05:42.342 --> 05:45.888
<i>There's nothing like a crisis
to bring New Yorkers together.</i>

05:47.931 --> 05:51.018
- Front door. We're aware of the blackout.
How can I help you?

05:51.018 --> 05:52.269
- The elevator's out?

05:52.269 --> 05:55.022
Exactly how am I supposed to get
these groceries up to my apartment?

05:55.022 --> 05:56.523
- Stairs are that way, Frank.

05:56.523 --> 05:57.733
- I live on eight.

05:57.733 --> 06:00.152
- When I lived in the Braxton,
they had a generator.

06:00.152 --> 06:04.114
- Hey, hey, hey! Everyone, shut it!

06:04.114 --> 06:06.700
You know how this works.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.745
It'll be over in five minutes.
Or five days.

06:09.745 --> 06:11.914
So, settle down

06:11.914 --> 06:13.624
and start sipping.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.670
It's medicinal, nutritional...

06:20.339 --> 06:21.673
and lightly alcoholic.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.594
First one's free. After that,

06:25.594 --> 06:28.305
cash only.

06:28.305 --> 06:29.848
- Front door.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.892
We're aware of the blackout.
How can I help you?

06:31.892 --> 06:34.561
Lester, it's Nina.
Did a package come for me?

06:34.561 --> 06:36.647
- Yes, Ms. Lin.
I-I'm looking at it right now.

06:36.647 --> 06:38.565
- Can you bring it up to me, please?

06:38.565 --> 06:39.816
- Oh, but the elevator's out.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.193
- And?

06:41.193 --> 06:42.819
<i>And you're on 14.</i>

06:43.695 --> 06:46.240
- You know, they're asking me to cut back
on building expenses.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.741
The old guy who holds a door open

06:47.741 --> 06:50.369
<i>that opens automatically would
seem like a good place to start.</i>

06:51.453 --> 06:54.623
A drone could get me that package
in five minutes without complaining.

06:54.623 --> 06:56.708
- Be right up in a...

06:56.708 --> 06:58.627
few more than five minutes.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.094
- See? Mob rule already.

07:07.094 --> 07:10.597
We're about 15 minutes away from
heads on spikes and cannibalism.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.599
- I'll protect you.

07:14.726 --> 07:16.436
- Where are you going?
The elevators are this way.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.773
- No electricity, no elevators, baby.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.109
- Oh, no. Absolutely not!
- Hey!

07:22.109 --> 07:23.902
Let's get climbing.

07:28.031 --> 07:30.117
- There he is. There he is.
Don't look, don't look, don't look.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.994
He's the one with
the Barney Greengrass tote.

07:32.828 --> 07:35.998
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I've seen him around. Handsome.

07:35.998 --> 07:37.583
- Oh, isn't he something?

07:37.583 --> 07:39.543
The power may be out,
but there are sparks flying

07:39.543 --> 07:41.545
off of that one.
- So ask him out.

07:42.713 --> 07:43.714
- What are you talking about?

07:43.714 --> 07:45.424
- He's subletting on your floor.

07:45.424 --> 07:47.843
Go knock on his door, stand tall,

07:47.843 --> 07:49.511
feet shoulder-width apart

07:49.511 --> 07:52.014
to communicate confidence,
and ask him out.

07:53.223 --> 07:55.726
- You are familiar with
the concept of a league, right?

07:55.726 --> 07:57.561
And being out of one?

07:57.561 --> 08:01.106
- Go ask him to borrow some batteries,
so he can light your lantern.

08:01.106 --> 08:02.900
- Okay, vulgar.

08:02.900 --> 08:04.318
- What's the worst that can happen?

08:04.318 --> 08:07.738
- I could weep. I could vomit.
I could burst into flames.

08:07.738 --> 08:10.073
- You could also die tomorrow,
having never gone on a date.

08:10.949 --> 08:13.785
If you never take a risk,
Howard, your life...

08:13.785 --> 08:17.039
will stay exactly as it is forever.

08:18.081 --> 08:19.833
- I don't mind my life.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.836
I have my apartment.
I have Yodelshop.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.172
I am the Assistant Director
of Collection Development

08:25.172 --> 08:27.174
at the Central Manhattan Public Library.

08:28.550 --> 08:29.801
And I have Sevelyn.

08:29.801 --> 08:32.679
- There may be more to life than cats.

08:34.348 --> 08:36.350
- I won't tell her you said that.

08:38.227 --> 08:39.728
Thank you, Doctor.

08:44.650 --> 08:47.736
- Okay, I can't go on.
- We're only on four.

08:47.736 --> 08:50.906
- What am I climbing
towards anyway?

08:50.906 --> 08:53.951
As soon as the lights come on,
my test results come in,

08:53.951 --> 08:55.827
and my identity implodes.

08:55.827 --> 08:58.455
No longer am I "Will's Loving Dad." I'm...

08:58.455 --> 09:00.541
"Dip Lover Cuckolded by King of Dips."

09:00.541 --> 09:02.668
- We're not climbing toward
your identity crisis.

09:02.668 --> 09:04.753
We're climbing towards Lucy.
She needs us.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.964
- All of us.
- Also, it's my knees.

09:06.964 --> 09:08.841
I-I just had them done.

09:08.841 --> 09:10.843
These are delicate models.

09:10.843 --> 09:12.845
They're Alfa Romeos, not ATVs.

09:12.845 --> 09:14.555
I-I can't handle this kind of off-roading.

09:14.555 --> 09:16.849
- I got these babies in '06, and look.
They're still kickin'.

09:16.849 --> 09:18.392
- Oh really? Who did yours?

09:18.392 --> 09:20.102
- Dr. Arslanian, 85th and Lex.

09:20.102 --> 09:22.229
- Get outta here! Arslanian did mine!

09:22.229 --> 09:23.772
- Best knee guy in Manhattan, right?

09:23.772 --> 09:25.148
- Oh, hands down!

09:25.148 --> 09:28.402
His receptionist, on the other hand,
I did not care for.

09:28.402 --> 09:29.903
- Don't get me started on Cheryl.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.197
- Hello? Killer at large?

09:32.197 --> 09:34.324
Child in peril?
- Sorry, you're right.

09:34.324 --> 09:37.119
- Seriously, guys, I-I don't think
I can make it. You go on without me.

09:37.119 --> 09:39.913
- If you dropped that 50-pound bag
of ballast, it would be easier.

09:41.707 --> 09:43.083
- I can't abandon them!

09:43.083 --> 09:44.918
- Hips before dips, Oliver.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.628
- Knees before cheese.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.347
- Stay alive! No matter what occurs,

09:57.347 --> 09:59.266
I will find you,

09:59.266 --> 10:01.643
no matter how long it takes.

10:01.643 --> 10:04.021
I <i>will</i> find you.
- Putnam!

10:04.021 --> 10:06.398
- Oh. Yeah. On my way.

10:07.566 --> 10:08.984
Ah...

10:25.626 --> 10:26.835
<i>Listen to me.</i>

10:26.835 --> 10:29.463
I couldn't heat this up
the way you wanted, but still.

10:29.463 --> 10:30.964
Num-num?

10:31.590 --> 10:33.509
Num-num.

10:33.509 --> 10:35.802
Sevelyn Marie Morris.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.054
Num-num.

10:50.651 --> 10:52.653
Hey! Do you have
any double D's I can borrow?

10:53.445 --> 10:55.656
Hey, you have any double D's I can borrow?

10:58.951 --> 11:00.911
- Oh!
- Oh my god!

11:00.911 --> 11:03.372
I'm so sorry.
I didn't realize you were out there.

11:03.372 --> 11:06.583
- I was just coming to see
if you had any batteries I could borrow.

11:06.583 --> 11:09.503
- That's amazing because I was just gonna
come and ask if you had any batteries

11:09.503 --> 11:12.256
I could borrow.
- That's so funny!

11:12.256 --> 11:13.549
Well,

11:13.549 --> 11:16.343
thanks. Guess I'll ask 3C.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.637
- Wait, no! Come in.
I have tons of batteries.

11:19.513 --> 11:22.641
- If you have tons of batteries, why were
you coming to ask if I had any batteries?

11:24.226 --> 11:26.228
- I mean, I have tons of candles.

11:26.228 --> 11:28.647
Can I interest you in a votive or a...

11:29.606 --> 11:31.108
a dripless taper?

11:31.108 --> 11:32.359
- Hm.

11:41.743 --> 11:44.538
- I brought your... and your...
- Shh!

11:44.538 --> 11:48.041
Just got her down. Oh, the baby swing.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.127
Please, God, let this help her sleep.

11:51.587 --> 11:53.630
- Ms. Lin...

11:53.630 --> 11:55.841
You think I could... sit?

11:56.758 --> 11:58.385
Just a couple minutes.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.054
It was a lot of stairs.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.183
- Fine.

12:14.484 --> 12:16.111
- Charles?

12:17.779 --> 12:19.198
Is that you?

12:26.163 --> 12:27.581
Charles...

12:37.049 --> 12:38.342
Charles?

12:57.653 --> 12:59.780
Oh God...

12:59.780 --> 13:02.533
Oh God, oh God. Oh God.

13:02.533 --> 13:05.327
Okay, please! I die here!

13:05.327 --> 13:06.870
J-just give me a cyanide pill

13:06.870 --> 13:09.081
and something fizzy to wash it down with.

13:09.081 --> 13:10.999
- It's two more flights.

13:10.999 --> 13:13.418
- Fine, b-but I'll need to be dragged.

13:13.418 --> 13:15.170
- Ugh...
- Come on, puppy.

13:16.547 --> 13:19.591
- Oh, Mama! Ah!
- Okay.

13:59.923 --> 14:01.717
- Lucy?

14:01.717 --> 14:03.969
- Did someone break in?
- Oh my god.

14:09.725 --> 14:11.643
- In here.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.940
Glitter Guy. She's running from him.

14:16.940 --> 14:18.942
- We have to go in after her.

14:19.818 --> 14:21.987
- I hope this is not weird of me to ask,

14:21.987 --> 14:24.489
but is that you I hear
sometimes singing down the hall?

14:25.782 --> 14:29.119
- Maybe you hear me practicing
with my Yodelshop quartet?

14:29.119 --> 14:30.621
Do you know Yodelshop?
- Mn-mm.

14:30.621 --> 14:32.331
- Classic barbershop harmonies

14:32.331 --> 14:35.000
punctuated by the ancient Alpine art
of distance yodeling?

14:35.000 --> 14:38.337
- I've never heard of it.
But, you have a beautiful voice.

14:38.337 --> 14:40.339
- No. I'm just an amateur.

14:40.339 --> 14:42.257
It's really a "don't quit
your day job" kind of thing.

14:42.257 --> 14:45.010
- Mm, see, that expression
gets me every time.

14:46.011 --> 14:48.430
My day job is singing. I'm a chorus boy.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.433
- Like on Broadway?
- Mm-hmm.

14:51.433 --> 14:53.268
I'm a hyena in <i>The Lion King.</i>

14:53.268 --> 14:55.187
Well, right now. I'm lucky,

14:55.187 --> 14:57.606
but it's an exhausting life.

14:57.606 --> 14:59.775
You can't imagine how much
I want to quit sometimes.

14:59.775 --> 15:02.611
- Wait, what could a Broadway star
possibly wish they did instead?

15:02.611 --> 15:04.613
- Mm... Alright, don't laugh.

15:06.031 --> 15:08.200
But I've always wanted to be
a children's librarian.

15:12.663 --> 15:14.498
- I'm a librarian.

15:14.498 --> 15:15.624
- Shut up.

15:16.291 --> 15:17.626
- That's our slogan.

15:18.210 --> 15:20.212
- Oh...

15:53.912 --> 15:55.831
- You didn't have to do that.

15:55.831 --> 15:58.834
- I think your baby girl
might feel differently.

15:59.501 --> 16:01.378
It's nice to be of use.

16:01.378 --> 16:04.298
Just an old guy who holds a door
that opens automatically.

16:04.882 --> 16:06.008
- I didn't mean to--

16:06.008 --> 16:07.384
- It's okay.

16:07.384 --> 16:09.178
I'm proud of my job.

16:09.178 --> 16:11.096
I enjoy helping people.

16:11.096 --> 16:12.139
What's all this?

16:13.307 --> 16:15.350
- Paperwork for the construction
we're going to do.

16:15.350 --> 16:16.351
- Oh.

16:16.351 --> 16:17.853
What's the plan?

16:17.853 --> 16:20.147
I know Bunny was saying
the stonework out front

16:20.147 --> 16:21.690
could use some TLC. Oh!

16:21.690 --> 16:24.276
There's a spot in the lobby that dips--
- Lester.

16:24.276 --> 16:27.571
- Right. I'm talkative.
That's the doorman in me.

16:28.530 --> 16:29.990
Got my wife that way though.

16:29.990 --> 16:32.159
She hates awkward silences.

16:32.159 --> 16:33.869
Says with me, she never has any.

16:33.869 --> 16:36.413
- Your wife is... Lorraine?

16:36.413 --> 16:37.497
- Yeah. How'd you know that?

16:38.582 --> 16:41.126
- Bunny used to quiz me on
all the people of the building.

16:41.126 --> 16:42.794
- She was the best.

16:42.794 --> 16:45.130
Always remembered
the kids' birthdays, too.

16:46.006 --> 16:48.008
- May and Frank.

16:48.884 --> 16:50.677
One's at SUNY Stony Brook,

16:50.677 --> 16:52.846
and the other's doing improv.

16:52.846 --> 16:55.265
And if I remember correctly,
you think they're really bad at it.

16:55.265 --> 16:58.101
- No! Bunny got that wrong.

17:03.524 --> 17:06.360
- Lester, have you heard anything
about who they think killed her?

17:06.360 --> 17:08.278
- No.

17:08.278 --> 17:10.656
But I must have let them in.

17:11.406 --> 17:13.700
That's what I think about.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.662
They must have walked right past me.

17:19.081 --> 17:20.958
- I just hope it's not some psycho

17:20.958 --> 17:22.751
who's got a thing
against board presidents.

17:31.593 --> 17:33.720
- Lucy?
- Lucy.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.681
- Okay, I can't see a thing.
- Shh!

17:35.681 --> 17:37.182
- Sorry. Sorry.

17:45.691 --> 17:47.818
- It's a wall.

17:47.818 --> 17:49.736
I'm standing in front of a wall.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.155
- I don't remember there
being a wall here.

17:52.155 --> 17:54.950
- Didn't we come from here?
Or was it back there?

17:54.950 --> 17:57.160
- What floor are we even on?

17:57.160 --> 17:58.412
- I have no idea.

17:58.412 --> 18:00.414
- Maybe we should just go back.

18:00.414 --> 18:01.874
- We can't go back.

18:01.874 --> 18:04.418
- Well, I, for one,
have to sit down for a minute.

18:04.418 --> 18:07.504
I haven't had this much exercise
in one day since I directed

18:07.504 --> 18:10.340
one of Suzanne Somers'
ThighMaster infomercials.

18:10.340 --> 18:13.177
- Oh, please tell us.
- Ugh. God...

18:13.177 --> 18:14.928
She liked everyone
around her to use them

18:14.928 --> 18:16.930
when she was getting touched up.

18:19.224 --> 18:21.727
- Lost in our own building.

18:23.562 --> 18:25.939
- I've been chasing a ghost all over town,

18:25.939 --> 18:28.442
and I'm no closer to knowing who he is.

18:31.737 --> 18:34.740
- Maybe Marv is right. We are stuck.

18:37.326 --> 18:40.662
- Was that <i>Sound of Silence</i>
I heard you singing yesterday?

18:40.662 --> 18:42.789
- It's the finale of our upcoming

18:42.789 --> 18:44.124
Simon and Garfyodel concert.

18:46.001 --> 18:47.085
- Can I hear a couple bars?

18:47.085 --> 18:49.004
- No, no, no, no, no. I never sing alone.

18:49.004 --> 18:50.964
That's why I founded a quartet.
- Okay.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.758
We'll duet!

18:52.758 --> 18:55.636
I'll do Simon, you do Garfyodel.

19:37.886 --> 19:39.721
- Shh!
- There's a killer!

19:39.721 --> 19:42.015
- Sorry. It's just one of the great
breaks in folk rock history.

19:42.015 --> 19:43.433
It's hard not to sing along.

19:49.147 --> 19:51.149
- Your baby stopped crying.

20:16.049 --> 20:17.176
- Ah-choo!

20:17.926 --> 20:18.760
Ah-choo!

20:20.053 --> 20:22.222
- Do you, by any chance, have a pet?

20:22.222 --> 20:24.266
- Uh, yes. I have a cat.

20:25.225 --> 20:26.727
- Oh, dear.

20:27.936 --> 20:29.980
I'm lethally allergic to cats-- Ah-choo!

20:30.689 --> 20:31.523
Ah-choo!

20:33.567 --> 20:35.444
- Guys?
- Lucy!

20:36.153 --> 20:37.779
Lucy!

20:37.779 --> 20:39.489
Are you alright?

20:39.489 --> 20:41.450
Hey!
- Oh good.

20:41.450 --> 20:42.784
- I think I need to go.

20:46.163 --> 20:47.581
Thank you.

20:47.581 --> 20:49.750
For a great... blackout.

20:51.710 --> 20:54.796
- You, too. I had fun.

21:03.138 --> 21:04.765
- They were right behind me.

21:04.765 --> 21:07.267
I-I think it was the person I saw
in here the night Bunny died.

21:08.018 --> 21:09.728
- The night... Excuse me?

21:10.604 --> 21:12.898
- The night of Mom's wedding.

21:12.898 --> 21:13.899
I was here that night.

21:13.899 --> 21:15.442
- Excuse me?!
- See,

21:15.442 --> 21:17.444
I knew that you would get mad.

21:19.154 --> 21:20.531
But...

21:21.281 --> 21:23.575
I saw... someone.

21:23.575 --> 21:25.619
- Wait, you saw the killer?
- That's why he's after you.

21:26.495 --> 21:28.247
- Do you remember
what his face looked like?

21:28.247 --> 21:30.707
- No. No, they were wearing a mask

21:30.707 --> 21:32.417
a-and some sort of, like, jumpsuit.

21:32.417 --> 21:33.460
- Did you hear their voice?

21:34.044 --> 21:36.922
- No.
- Anything memorable? Like a weird gait.

21:38.048 --> 21:39.550
Lucy, did he walk funny?
No.

21:39.550 --> 21:41.176
They just... looked at me

21:41.176 --> 21:42.928
and sneezed, and then they ran off.

21:42.928 --> 21:44.555
- Sneezed?

21:44.555 --> 21:46.598
- Lucy, think hard. Was it a...

21:46.598 --> 21:49.977
"ah... choo!"
Or a, "Ah! Choo"?

21:49.977 --> 21:52.604
- Uh... the second one?

21:52.604 --> 21:54.356
- Ah.
- Why? What does that mean?

21:54.356 --> 21:56.358
- No idea.
- Okay.

21:56.358 --> 21:58.277
You and I need a new system
for hanging out.

21:58.277 --> 21:59.945
It can't happen like this anymore.

22:00.696 --> 22:02.739
- Yeah, I-I'm good with that.

22:03.115 --> 22:05.951
- Guys, we need to get somewhere safe.

22:05.951 --> 22:08.370
- Okay. I never thought
I'd say this during a blackout,

22:08.370 --> 22:10.622
but we need to go someplace
where other people are.

22:13.166 --> 22:14.835
- Ah!
- Go! Go!

22:25.596 --> 22:27.598
- This way! Come on!

22:53.165 --> 22:56.585
Ow! Ow, ow! Ow...

22:56.585 --> 22:58.420
Ah! Ow!

23:08.430 --> 23:09.556
Ah!

23:11.558 --> 23:14.311
- Is there <i>nothing</i> dips can't do?

23:25.739 --> 23:26.990
Marv?

23:26.990 --> 23:28.784
- What the fuck?

23:30.244 --> 23:31.495
- I should be going.

23:35.207 --> 23:37.751
Is that the, uh...

23:37.751 --> 23:39.461
Wow. That's more than

23:39.461 --> 23:40.754
a bit of stonework, huh?

23:44.591 --> 23:47.219
I'm headed downstairs.
Need me to mail those papers?

23:47.219 --> 23:49.847
I'm not a robot,
but I can still be helpful.

23:51.390 --> 23:54.852
- You know what? Maybe I should
double-check. In the light.

23:56.478 --> 23:58.856
About that talk of automation...

23:59.439 --> 24:01.316
We may need to consider
what we'd lose

24:01.316 --> 24:03.777
without the human touch at the door.

24:03.777 --> 24:06.780
Maybe some jobs could shift?
Instead of getting cut?

24:07.906 --> 24:10.868
How does Director of
Resident Support sound?

24:12.744 --> 24:13.787
- Yeah.

24:14.705 --> 24:15.706
Yeah.

24:37.603 --> 24:39.605
- Hi.
- Hi!

24:39.605 --> 24:41.440
- So, hypothetically,

24:41.440 --> 24:44.276
if I sent my cat to live with Agnes
from the library for a while

24:44.276 --> 24:47.571
and got an air purifier
and vacuumed my entire apartment

24:47.571 --> 24:50.199
and lint rolled all of my sweaters
twice like I did to this one--

24:50.199 --> 24:53.076
- It's very nice.
- Oh, thank you. It's new.

24:53.076 --> 24:54.786
If I did all of those things...

24:55.829 --> 24:58.540
would you consider
going on a date with me?

24:58.540 --> 24:59.583
In the light?

25:02.211 --> 25:04.213
- Nothing would make me happier.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.089
How about right now?

25:06.089 --> 25:08.759
And please...

25:08.759 --> 25:10.761
Don't get rid of your cat.

25:12.012 --> 25:13.514
- Marv killed Bunny?

25:13.514 --> 25:15.974
- I did not do that. No.

25:15.974 --> 25:18.268
- Then explain yourself, Marv.

25:18.268 --> 25:20.604
- You chased an innocent child.

25:21.271 --> 25:23.899
- And forced a luminary
of the American theater

25:23.899 --> 25:27.611
to drag a sack of dips up four flights
of stairs like a Volga boatsman.

25:27.611 --> 25:31.198
- I wanted to protect her.
From the Sixth Avenue Slasher.

25:31.198 --> 25:32.950
- Then why are you wearing that suit?

25:32.950 --> 25:34.868
- These are my work clothes.
I'm a mold inspector.

25:35.494 --> 25:37.496
I've done work in the building
over the years,

25:37.496 --> 25:40.165
and I went up the back way
when you said you were worried about Lucy.

25:40.165 --> 25:42.209
- He's not who I saw.

25:42.209 --> 25:44.211
He's right. He's not who chased me.
- W...

25:44.211 --> 25:45.921
Wait...

25:45.921 --> 25:48.549
Is there a <i>convention</i> going on
in these passageways?

25:48.549 --> 25:50.384
- Look, I'm sorry.

25:51.343 --> 25:53.720
I just wanted to be a part of it.

25:54.429 --> 25:56.098
I thought if I could help,

25:56.098 --> 25:58.851
maybe I could catch
the Sixth Avenue Slasher,

25:58.851 --> 26:00.227
which is still a good theory.

26:00.227 --> 26:03.230
Or maybe I could get
another mention on your podcast.

26:03.230 --> 26:05.941
Or maybe my daughter
would regard me in a way

26:05.941 --> 26:09.695
that feels something akin
to mildly friendly

26:09.695 --> 26:12.197
or possibly even forgiving.

26:13.991 --> 26:17.035
I miss my daughter.
I know you can relate to that.

26:20.205 --> 26:23.000
And maybe I could get a button
with my face on it.

26:24.585 --> 26:25.961
- Marv?

26:26.670 --> 26:28.380
You're not well.

26:28.380 --> 26:30.340
- Yeah. I've heard that.

26:30.340 --> 26:32.634
- But you scared the killer away.
- I what?

26:32.634 --> 26:35.762
- Well, they ran off when they saw
your flashlight. It had to be him.

26:35.762 --> 26:36.805
- Hold on.
Are you saying Marv--

26:36.805 --> 26:38.932
- Did a <i>good</i> thing?

26:39.725 --> 26:41.685
- A-alright, Marv...

26:41.685 --> 26:43.645
Come by tomorrow.
We'll record you for an episode.

26:44.897 --> 26:48.108
What? We're low on
quality content this season.

26:48.817 --> 26:50.152
I'll take Marv.

26:51.236 --> 26:52.237
- Ah!

26:52.237 --> 26:53.655
- I just don't get it.

26:53.655 --> 26:56.200
We've seen whoever the killer
is four times.

26:56.200 --> 26:58.619
Lucy saw them the night Bunny was killed,

26:58.619 --> 27:01.705
we all saw them on the surveillance
footage at the diner,

27:01.705 --> 27:03.540
and I fucking saw the Glitter Guy.

27:03.540 --> 27:06.877
- But are they all the same person?
- Well, the person Lucy saw--

27:06.877 --> 27:08.587
Hey, where is-- Where's Lucy?

27:09.254 --> 27:10.506
- Wait. There she is!

27:12.424 --> 27:14.259
What the hell is he doing here?
Hey.

27:14.259 --> 27:15.511
Look who it is.

27:16.595 --> 27:17.596
Lucy, was it?

27:17.596 --> 27:18.764
- Yeah.

27:18.764 --> 27:21.517
- Lucy was telling me some crazy shit
just went down with you guys,

27:21.517 --> 27:24.478
beyond the normal, uh, blackout stuff.

27:24.478 --> 27:27.940
- We were, uh... It's-- It's all okay now.
- Yeah.

27:27.940 --> 27:29.441
- Is it?

27:29.441 --> 27:31.652
Good. You know, I was just
in the neighborhood,

27:32.528 --> 27:33.862
just trying to make sure
you guys weren't

27:33.862 --> 27:36.448
up to any of your, uh, shenanigans,
you know what I mean?

27:36.448 --> 27:38.116
You got to be careful out there.

27:39.034 --> 27:40.536
Especially in the dark.

27:41.787 --> 27:44.164
- Thank you.
- Th-that is such good advice.

27:44.164 --> 27:46.542
- Yeah. Let's go, Lucy.

27:49.586 --> 27:52.089
- So you <i>happened</i> to be
in the neighborhood.

27:53.131 --> 27:56.718
You don't seem like an Upper West Side guy
to me, Detective Kreps.

27:56.718 --> 27:58.428
- Oh, don't I?

27:58.428 --> 28:00.222
I go to Zabar's all the time.

28:00.222 --> 28:02.015
Best bagel, cream cheese,
and lox in the city.

28:04.059 --> 28:06.103
You interested in me, Mabel? Hm?

28:06.103 --> 28:08.188
I'm interested in you.

28:08.689 --> 28:10.566
You know, I saw that, uh,

28:10.566 --> 28:12.568
little viral video of yours.

28:14.194 --> 28:16.822
What's stopping me
from locking you up today, huh?

28:16.822 --> 28:18.824
- I was wondering the same thing.

28:19.533 --> 28:21.118
But why are you here?

28:21.118 --> 28:23.370
Other than interrogating teenage girls?

28:23.370 --> 28:25.163
- That's just one part of the job
I happen to like.

28:25.163 --> 28:27.291
- So, where should we go?
- Do you know the Pickle?

28:27.291 --> 28:29.751
- I do not.
- They have the best disco fries in--

28:29.751 --> 28:31.170
Ooh, sorry. I'm sorry.

28:34.381 --> 28:36.300
- I just-- I got a new tattoo.

28:37.467 --> 28:39.469
What are you looking at, kook?

28:41.054 --> 28:43.473
Hm?
Yeah, drink your milk, weirdo.

28:47.769 --> 28:50.772
Have a good night, Mabel. Alright?

28:55.986 --> 28:57.988
- You, too, Detective Kreps.

28:58.780 --> 29:00.782
It's nice to have the light back again.
