WEBVTT

00:01.220 --> 00:03.219
One, two, three!

00:03.220 --> 00:05.820
Claire: Hey, guys!
We're here!

00:05.860 --> 00:07.160
Welcome!

00:07.190 --> 00:08.830
Pool's cool,
snacks in the kitchen,

00:08.860 --> 00:11.830
I've had some rosÃ©,
so fun Mitchell is in the house.

00:11.860 --> 00:13.660
Showing quite
a bit of leg.

00:13.700 --> 00:15.500
This is very...
World-cuppy?

00:16.870 --> 00:18.170
Jay:
There they are!

00:18.200 --> 00:20.670
My adult children
still sponging off me

00:20.700 --> 00:23.010
after nearly
five decades.
Love it.

00:23.040 --> 00:25.380
Sorry, thought I'd
bend that into a joke,
but it stayed real.

00:26.380 --> 00:28.180
-Hi, kids!
-Hey, Grandpa.

00:28.210 --> 00:29.380
Cameron: Come on, Lily.
Come on.

00:29.410 --> 00:32.350
Hey, Phil.
Hm.

00:33.380 --> 00:34.850
What's up his can?

00:34.880 --> 00:36.190
I don't know.

00:36.220 --> 00:38.360
Not easy being a white man
these days.

00:38.390 --> 00:39.690
You feel me.

00:39.720 --> 00:42.390
So, I got Dad and Gloria's
anniversary present.

00:42.430 --> 00:44.030
You guys both
owe me 40 bucks.

00:44.060 --> 00:45.200
Wait.
It's their anniversary?

00:45.230 --> 00:46.860
I-I thought it was
Gloria's birthday.

00:46.900 --> 00:48.200
Oh, it can't be
Gloria's birthday.

00:48.230 --> 00:50.030
She gets mad even
if you mention it.

00:50.070 --> 00:51.370
I once asked
when it was,

00:51.400 --> 00:53.200
and she left a dismembered
Bratz doll in my purse.

00:55.410 --> 00:56.710
Then why
are we here?

00:56.740 --> 00:59.040
You know what? I'm gonna
go check what the cake says.

00:59.080 --> 01:00.540
Oh, I'll have a glass
of "cake," too.

01:00.580 --> 01:01.910
Okay.

01:01.950 --> 01:03.910
Quick, before she comes back,
I need some relationship advice,

01:03.950 --> 01:05.920
and this is kind of
in a gray area ethically.

01:05.950 --> 01:07.220
Oh, and it's okay
to ask us

01:07.250 --> 01:08.920
because, as gays, we wouldn't
dare judge anyone

01:08.950 --> 01:11.050
while living such
a deviant lifestyle?

01:11.090 --> 01:13.890
Even the most beautiful version
of our love is a mortal stain

01:13.920 --> 01:16.230
compared to the worst thing
you could do?

01:16.260 --> 01:17.390
Maybe I should
talk to somebody else.

01:17.430 --> 01:19.060
-No, tell us!
-No! Spill, girl, spill!

01:19.100 --> 01:20.600
Okay, so just
between us,

01:20.630 --> 01:22.600
you know I'm with Arvin and
he's working in Switzerland.

01:22.630 --> 01:23.930
Well, I did
something bad.

01:24.930 --> 01:25.900
I kissed Dylan.

01:25.940 --> 01:28.410
Whoa! Whoa,
Dylan's still around?

01:28.440 --> 01:30.270
I-I thought he joined
a cult or something.

01:30.310 --> 01:32.610
I heard he ate Mentos and a Coke
and exploded.

01:32.640 --> 01:34.580
I don't know why I did it.
I meant nothing,

01:34.610 --> 01:36.610
but I feel horrible,
and Arvin keeps calling,

01:36.650 --> 01:38.080
but I'm not picking up
because, like --

01:38.110 --> 01:39.450
Do I have
to tell him?

01:39.480 --> 01:42.950
Uh, uh, honey, these things
happen in every relationship.

01:42.990 --> 01:45.760
You absolutely do not need
to tell your partner everything.

01:45.790 --> 01:47.920
Okay, well, that's a fun thing
to hear your husband say.

01:47.960 --> 01:49.590
Oh, please, do not turn this
into something.

01:49.630 --> 01:51.760
Well, I was going to say,
yes, you need to tell Arvin

01:51.800 --> 01:53.600
because you want your
relationship based on truth,

01:53.630 --> 01:54.960
which, apparently,
mine is not.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.930
Ugh, this sucks!
I don't know what to do.

01:56.970 --> 01:58.770
I was counting on you two
to be on the same page.

01:58.800 --> 02:01.270
Well,
we usually are.
When have you
ever seen that?

02:01.310 --> 02:02.770
What are you hens
cackling about?

02:02.810 --> 02:04.970
Oh, just asking how they are.

02:05.010 --> 02:07.140
- Gonna jump in the pool.
- Okay, see you.

02:07.180 --> 02:09.110
Haley doesn't care
how people are.

02:09.150 --> 02:10.650
What's going on?
It's nothing.

02:10.680 --> 02:12.950
She was just asking
for some advice.

02:12.980 --> 02:14.120
Why wouldn't
she come to me?

02:14.150 --> 02:16.450
I thought we were
finally becoming friends.

02:16.490 --> 02:17.820
Well, you know,
think about it, Claire.

02:17.850 --> 02:20.120
All the secrets that
you kept from your mom.

02:20.160 --> 02:22.130
Yeah, but my mom

02:22.160 --> 02:23.990
was an uptight, crazy person.

02:24.030 --> 02:26.830
Let's just slowly back away
as that settles in.

02:29.830 --> 02:31.840
-- Captions by VITAC --

02:34.840 --> 02:40.810
t1

02:44.680 --> 02:45.980
Hey, buddy!

02:46.020 --> 02:48.690
Ready for the best thing
to happen to your mouth since --

02:48.720 --> 02:51.820
I'm gonna bail on that.
I took off without a place to land.

02:51.860 --> 02:53.990
How about
a Mint "Jay-lep"?
I'll pass,

02:54.020 --> 02:56.160
seeing as I'm not a
hundred-year-old Southern lady.

02:58.860 --> 03:00.830
Phil: I finally saw the movie
"Mean Girls."

03:00.860 --> 03:02.670
I know.
I'm a middle-aged man.

03:02.700 --> 03:04.200
How'd I wait so long?

03:04.230 --> 03:07.500
The point is, I realized
I have a mean girl in my life --

03:07.540 --> 03:08.670
Jay.

03:08.710 --> 03:09.870
Like last week at this wedding,

03:09.910 --> 03:11.710
I'm rocking my moonwalk,
and Jay yells,

03:11.740 --> 03:15.210
"Hey, look,
it's Michael Jerkson."

03:15.250 --> 03:16.710
Enough's enough.

03:16.750 --> 03:19.520
How do you get a mean girl
to stop being a mean girl?

03:19.550 --> 03:22.020
Be mean girlier.

03:22.050 --> 03:23.520
No, no, no, no,
you're gonna love it.

03:23.550 --> 03:25.360
Mint Jay-leps
are all the rage.

03:25.390 --> 03:27.220
Oh, you keep saying
"Jay-leps."

03:27.260 --> 03:30.530
Yeah, well I made juleps, and --
and -- and my name's Jay,

03:30.560 --> 03:31.900
so I call them
"Jay-leps."

03:31.930 --> 03:33.560
No, I get it.

03:35.230 --> 03:36.700
It's just a fun thing.

03:36.730 --> 03:39.200
Ooh, are these the Mint Jay-leps
we've been hearing about?

03:39.240 --> 03:40.700
Yeah.
Oh, Jay-leps.

03:40.740 --> 03:42.710
Adorbs.
They are adorbs.

03:42.740 --> 03:44.040
Why do I
doubt myself?

03:44.070 --> 03:45.710
Mmm. Manny!

03:45.740 --> 03:46.910
How was
the road trip?

03:46.940 --> 03:49.910
Uh, what can I say?
Six weeks, 33 states,

03:49.950 --> 03:52.250
a lot of fake scrotums
on the back of pickup trucks.

03:52.280 --> 03:55.390
And he met a very nice girlfriend,
and he's in love.

03:55.420 --> 03:57.050
-Ohh!
-Let's see a pic.

03:57.090 --> 03:58.420
Wish I could.

03:58.460 --> 04:00.060
I-I went old-school
and used a film camera,

04:00.090 --> 04:02.560
and the one roll I took of her
fell into the Grand Canyon.

04:02.590 --> 04:04.390
You don't have
a single photo of her?

04:04.430 --> 04:07.230
Uh, well, just this blurry one
on my phone.

04:07.260 --> 04:08.230
-Oh, let's see.

04:08.260 --> 04:09.400
-Oh
-Look at her.

04:09.430 --> 04:10.570
Yeah, you can't really

04:10.600 --> 04:12.570
make her out, but it captures
her wild spirit.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.140
Yes.

04:16.440 --> 04:18.410
Is it me, or is Manny
dating Bigfoot?
Yeah.

04:18.440 --> 04:19.579
Let me tell you
the difference

04:19.610 --> 04:21.950
between Manny's girlfriend
and Bigfoot.

04:21.980 --> 04:23.280
Bigfoot could be real.

04:23.310 --> 04:24.750
She's not
a fake girlfriend.

04:24.780 --> 04:26.280
You want to hear
the kicker?

04:26.320 --> 04:27.280
She's from Canada.

04:27.320 --> 04:28.920
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yikes.

04:28.950 --> 04:31.760
Oh, stop it!
Back me up, boys.

04:31.790 --> 04:32.760
You know what,
Gloria?

04:32.790 --> 04:34.920
Canada is good
for a lot of things,

04:34.960 --> 04:37.430
but their number-one export
is fake girlfriends.

04:37.460 --> 04:39.100
Yeah, it's kind of
a thing.

04:39.130 --> 04:40.600
Uh, before Cam and I
came out,

04:40.630 --> 04:42.430
we each had
Canadian girlfriends.

04:42.470 --> 04:44.930
So, what are you saying now?
That Manny's gay?

04:44.970 --> 04:49.140
We weren't, but he does check
a few of the boxes.

04:49.170 --> 04:50.770
Come on.
Look at him.

04:50.810 --> 04:54.440
He's as straight as the swim
from Cartagena to Houston.

04:54.480 --> 04:57.150
The trip was amazing,
and I did the cheekiest thing.

04:57.180 --> 04:58.950
I saw "Oklahoma!"
in Oklahoma,

04:58.980 --> 05:00.620
"Chicago" in Chicago,
and then,

05:00.650 --> 05:03.290
I got in a little trouble
in River City.

05:03.320 --> 05:05.460
Mm.
Okay, that's the gayest thing
I've ever heard,

05:05.490 --> 05:07.620
and I shampooed dogs
in West Hollywood.

05:07.660 --> 05:09.130
He's had
so many girlfriends.

05:09.160 --> 05:11.800
The last one was
a woman in her 20s.

05:11.830 --> 05:13.960
Yeah, but didn't you say he was
so sweet when she stayed over

05:14.000 --> 05:15.130
he offered to sleep
on the couch?

05:15.160 --> 05:18.330
So what?
My first boyfriend at his age,

05:18.370 --> 05:20.000
he wasn't ready
to sleep with me.

05:20.040 --> 05:21.810
Mm-hmm, and
what does he do now?

05:21.840 --> 05:25.140
He runs a very nice
bed and breakfast.

05:25.170 --> 05:26.180
-With...?
-With...?

05:26.210 --> 05:28.010
His good friend Steven!

05:28.040 --> 05:29.350
Shut up!

05:30.350 --> 05:32.980
I-I really
feel for Manny

05:33.020 --> 05:34.980
if he's wrestling
with this secret.

05:35.020 --> 05:36.490
Yet you had
no problem keeping

05:36.520 --> 05:38.490
an indiscretion from me
for 16 years.

05:38.520 --> 05:39.690
And off we go.
Yeah.

05:39.720 --> 05:41.830
Just like the shorts of
that beefy UPS driver

05:41.860 --> 05:43.330
that delivered you
two packages that day.

05:43.360 --> 05:45.500
Wow, that is
not what happened!

05:45.530 --> 05:47.160
So, you admit
something happened!

05:47.200 --> 05:48.500
Okay, I'm gonna tell you
everything

05:48.530 --> 05:50.500
'cause it is so much tamer
than what's in your head.

05:50.530 --> 05:52.840
Okay.
Six weeks
into our relationship,

05:52.870 --> 05:54.840
before we decided
we were exclusive,

05:54.870 --> 05:57.340
I kissed
someone in a bar.

05:57.370 --> 05:59.680
See, it's not
a big deal.
Okay, yes,
it is a big deal,

05:59.710 --> 06:01.850
which is why
I rejected

06:01.880 --> 06:04.550
a very similar advance
at the same time

06:04.580 --> 06:06.180
from a celebrity,

06:06.220 --> 06:07.350
but I'm not gonna tell you
who that is,

06:07.380 --> 06:08.850
because I don't
want you to feel insecure.

06:08.890 --> 06:10.350
Cam, we both know
you're seconds away

06:10.390 --> 06:13.020
from telling me --
It was Isaac Mizrahi!

06:13.060 --> 06:14.720
Yeah, that's right.

06:14.760 --> 06:16.260
Cindy Crawford's friend!

06:20.100 --> 06:22.200
There you are.

06:22.230 --> 06:23.700
We haven't had a chance
to talk about anything

06:23.730 --> 06:25.200
since you got back.

06:25.230 --> 06:28.200
So, tell me about this
new Canadian girlfriend.

06:28.240 --> 06:30.740
Well, she's brilliant,
but humble,

06:30.770 --> 06:32.580
beautiful,
but accessible,

06:32.610 --> 06:34.240
one of the funniest people
I've ever met,

06:34.280 --> 06:36.210
but, also,
deeply serious.

06:36.250 --> 06:39.220
Ah, such lovely,
general terms.

06:39.250 --> 06:41.750
She sounds a little bit
too good to be true.

06:41.790 --> 06:43.090
What is her name?

06:43.120 --> 06:44.420
It's Sherry Shaker.

06:45.460 --> 06:47.090
Sherry Shaker?

06:47.120 --> 06:49.760
Those are the two things that
are in front of you at this bar.

06:49.790 --> 06:51.600
Delightful!

06:51.630 --> 06:52.760
Manny...

06:52.800 --> 06:55.400
is there anything
that you need to tell me?

06:55.430 --> 06:57.730
Maybe some kind of...

06:57.770 --> 06:59.570
sexual thing?

06:59.600 --> 07:00.600
Um...

07:01.770 --> 07:03.910
I really don't want
to talk about this.

07:03.940 --> 07:05.910
Okay, papi,
but you know I love you

07:05.940 --> 07:07.440
and that you can be
honest with me

07:07.480 --> 07:09.280
about anything, right?

07:09.310 --> 07:11.250
In that case...

07:11.280 --> 07:12.750
This is a lot.

07:12.780 --> 07:14.280
I'm pretty
desensitized to it,

07:14.320 --> 07:15.990
but I saw Luke
walk into a wall.

07:21.290 --> 07:22.760
What are you guys
laughing at?

07:22.790 --> 07:24.260
Oh, I wouldn't
worry about it.

07:24.290 --> 07:25.800
You said something funny,
didn't you?

07:25.830 --> 07:27.760
The guy's
a joke machine!
Mm-hmm.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.270
Oh, someone's
sitting there.
Who?

07:29.300 --> 07:31.640
Someone who doesn't ask
a million questions.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.340
Grandpa,
you can sit with us.

07:36.970 --> 07:37.940
Great.

07:37.970 --> 07:40.440
It was working,
but it was killing me.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.950
I've actually had dreams
where the only thing happening

07:42.980 --> 07:45.110
was me sitting with Jay
while he, you know,

07:45.150 --> 07:47.280
tousles my hair,
calling me "Sport."

07:47.320 --> 07:48.790
Congrats, honey.

07:48.820 --> 07:51.290
Always proud to celebrate
one of your awards.

07:51.320 --> 07:52.960
I didn't
win an award.

07:52.990 --> 07:54.790
Well, then, what
are we all doing here?

07:54.820 --> 07:56.290
I'm a busy man!

07:56.330 --> 07:58.960
Don't you
just golf now?
I work
when it's raining.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.460
Why am I defending myself
to you?

08:00.500 --> 08:01.800
And why is your father
mad at me?

08:01.830 --> 08:03.630
Did I do something?
Probably.

08:03.670 --> 08:05.000
Isn't that
your relationship?

08:05.030 --> 08:07.640
He's always desperate for your
approval and you shoot him down?

08:07.670 --> 08:09.470
It's supposed to be, but
all of a sudden, he's, like...

08:09.510 --> 08:11.810
all cold.

08:11.840 --> 08:13.140
Wouldn't let me
sit with him.

08:13.180 --> 08:15.510
Ugh, so high school.

08:15.550 --> 08:17.150
Dad and I watched "Mean Girls"
the other night,

08:17.180 --> 08:18.820
and I chewed off
a piece of my hair

08:18.850 --> 08:20.720
reliving
how awful it was.

08:21.690 --> 08:22.850
Wait.

08:22.890 --> 08:25.660
In the movie, the heroine
takes down the head mean girl

08:25.690 --> 08:27.660
by being mean to her.

08:27.690 --> 08:29.360
Maybe that's what Dad
is doing to you?

08:30.530 --> 08:32.159
Son of a bitch.

08:32.200 --> 08:34.159
Phil thinks
he can "Mean Girls" me?

08:34.200 --> 08:36.000
How lame is that?
Let me tell you something --

08:36.030 --> 08:38.330
I might be a pretty face,
but I fight to win.

08:38.370 --> 08:40.070
Just like "Legally Blonde"!

08:42.570 --> 08:44.670
Oh, you're not looking
at your phone.

08:44.710 --> 08:46.880
Is everything okay?
Yeah, everything's fine.

08:46.910 --> 08:49.010
You know,
if something was on your mind,

08:49.050 --> 08:51.350
I'm an excellent person
to confide in.

08:51.380 --> 08:52.680
No judgment.

08:52.720 --> 08:55.350
God knows I've done some stuff
I'm not proud of.

08:55.380 --> 08:57.550
Like what?

08:58.590 --> 09:00.690
J-Just like...

09:00.720 --> 09:02.360
shoplifting.

09:02.390 --> 09:04.530
Wow. Really?
Mm-hmm.

09:04.560 --> 09:06.200
I mean, no judgment here --
I do it, too.

09:06.230 --> 09:08.200
What? You do?

09:08.230 --> 09:10.030
Yeah, but I'm very ethical
about it.

09:10.070 --> 09:12.740
I only take things from
companies that use child labor.

09:12.770 --> 09:15.370
That is how my generation
is saving the world.

09:15.400 --> 09:18.540
Haley, I did not
raise you to steal.

09:18.570 --> 09:20.040
You just said
you do it, too!

09:20.080 --> 09:21.540
I made that up
so you would tell me

09:21.580 --> 09:23.210
what's going on
in your life!
Why would I?

09:23.250 --> 09:25.050
Stuff a couple Pakistani
lipsticks in my purse,

09:25.080 --> 09:26.420
and you freak out at me!

09:29.450 --> 09:31.920
Well, well, well, if it isn't
John, Paul, and George.

09:31.960 --> 09:33.390
Anyone need a Ringo?

09:33.420 --> 09:35.220
Actually, we can get by

09:35.260 --> 09:37.260
without a little help
from you, friend.

09:38.590 --> 09:39.900
Well...

09:39.930 --> 09:42.100
pool's so over,
anyways.

09:42.130 --> 09:45.070
Maybe, uh, the guys
want to hit the H2O,

09:45.100 --> 09:46.570
rock some Marco Polo.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.440
Good for you not
letting that chest

09:48.470 --> 09:50.270
get in the way
of having fun.

09:50.310 --> 09:52.080
Most guys
wouldn't go shirtless

09:52.110 --> 09:53.580
until they got
a little...

09:53.610 --> 09:54.640
muscle.

09:55.980 --> 09:57.750
We need to talk.
Wait. Something weird
is happening.

09:57.780 --> 09:59.420
I want to see
how it plays out.

09:59.450 --> 10:01.420
Who's ready
to hit the pool?

10:01.450 --> 10:02.420
Marco!

10:02.450 --> 10:04.820
Solo!

10:07.960 --> 10:11.260
Okay, I know emotional slights
usually roll off me

10:11.290 --> 10:13.600
like water
off a mule's back --
Isn't it "duck"?

10:13.630 --> 10:15.600
Uh, a lot of animals bead,
Mitchell.
Mm-hmm.

10:15.630 --> 10:17.600
The point is
I need to know details.

10:17.630 --> 10:19.600
I need to know
what happened...

10:19.640 --> 10:21.100
...and with whom.

10:21.140 --> 10:23.270
Was it a peck?
Was it with Pepper?

10:23.310 --> 10:24.440
Was he drunk?

10:24.470 --> 10:25.980
Did you get a peck
from a pickled Pepper?

10:26.010 --> 10:27.440
How long have you been
sitting on that?

10:27.480 --> 10:29.610
You kissed a man
six week--

10:29.650 --> 10:31.310
-Hi.
-Hi.

10:32.980 --> 10:35.450
You kissed a man six weeks
into our relationship

10:35.480 --> 10:37.290
when I'm telling you
"I love you."

10:37.320 --> 10:39.460
I'm calling my mom,
telling her I'd met the one

10:39.490 --> 10:41.990
while you're sidled up next to
some cha-cha queen at a urinal.

10:42.030 --> 10:44.130
Okay, this insane reaction
is proof

10:44.160 --> 10:45.460
that I did the right thing
not telling you.

10:45.490 --> 10:47.460
Okay, everyone knows
this kind of secret

10:47.500 --> 10:48.970
is poison, Mitchell.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.170
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

10:50.200 --> 10:51.840
Let's take it
to the room.

10:51.870 --> 10:53.970
Hey, you all heard
that whole conversation, right?

10:54.000 --> 10:55.140
Of course, yeah.
SÃ­.
Yeah.

10:55.170 --> 10:58.140
So, Phil,
if Claire kissed someone

10:58.170 --> 11:01.680
very early into the relationship,
should she have told you?

11:01.710 --> 11:03.310
-Of course.
-No way.

11:03.350 --> 11:05.150
What?
Did you kiss someone?

11:05.180 --> 11:07.980
See? Secrets.
Tearing them apart.

11:08.020 --> 11:09.990
Mitch and Cam,
I just want you to know

11:10.020 --> 11:11.990
that I support
your lifestyle,

11:12.020 --> 11:13.860
and I find it
very charming

11:13.890 --> 11:16.330
when your people
act very emotional

11:16.360 --> 11:18.530
and inappropriate
in public.

11:18.560 --> 11:20.500
Okay, so I'm getting
no help from this room.

11:20.530 --> 11:23.000
I'm sorry, but kissing someone
outside of a relationship

11:23.030 --> 11:25.000
is a big deal and you should
fess up right away.

11:25.030 --> 11:26.340
You told them?!

11:26.370 --> 11:27.840
Yes! Yes, they told us
everything,

11:27.870 --> 11:29.340
and I can't believe
you did that!

11:29.370 --> 11:32.010
Well, I'm sorry, but Dylan
was a huge part of my life --

11:32.040 --> 11:34.510
You kissed Dylan?!
That's your secret?

11:34.540 --> 11:35.680
You tricked me!

11:35.710 --> 11:37.380
What are you doing?

11:37.410 --> 11:39.850
You are dating
a world-renowned scientist.

11:39.880 --> 11:41.680
I mean, isn't Dylan
still married

11:41.720 --> 11:43.190
and still an idiot?

11:43.220 --> 11:45.520
Hey, he is
not still married.

11:45.550 --> 11:47.860
And he's getting his life together.
He's in nursing school.

11:47.890 --> 11:50.190
Good for him.
I love Dylan.

11:50.230 --> 11:51.900
Honey,
she's dating Arvin.

11:51.930 --> 11:53.360
We love Arvin now.

11:53.400 --> 11:54.860
And wouldn't
it be wonderful

11:54.900 --> 11:58.700
if someone called Dylan
loved someone called Arvin?

11:58.730 --> 12:01.370
No one in this room would have
a problem with it.

12:01.400 --> 12:04.210
Am I wrong, or is your mom
trying to get Alex

12:04.240 --> 12:05.410
to come out
of the closet?

12:06.740 --> 12:08.210
Oh, God,
it's Arvin calling.

12:08.240 --> 12:10.250
Quick, a show of hands,
who thinks I have to tell him?

12:11.410 --> 12:12.550
One, two, three, four.

12:12.580 --> 12:14.450
Four out of nine?
A frickin' tie?!

12:16.290 --> 12:18.750
Yay, I'm so happy
I finally reached you!

12:18.790 --> 12:20.060
I know.

12:20.090 --> 12:22.760
How's work?
Any major breakthroughs?

12:22.790 --> 12:24.890
Oh, well,
I-I made a German laugh.

12:26.430 --> 12:28.400
Oh, I miss you terribly.

12:28.430 --> 12:30.600
I miss you, too.

12:30.630 --> 12:33.070
Uh, listen,
um, we have to talk.

12:33.100 --> 12:36.440
I love you, and this is
really hard for me to say,

12:36.470 --> 12:38.070
but, I, um...

12:38.110 --> 12:39.910
I did something stupid.

12:39.940 --> 12:42.110
I kissed my ex-boyfriend.
It meant nothing, I swear,

12:42.150 --> 12:45.110
and I'm hoping you'll forgive me,
and we can forget this ever happened.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.920
Sorry, love,
you froze up.

12:48.950 --> 12:50.920
I-I-I missed the --
the whole thing.

12:50.950 --> 12:52.620
Oh, that sucks.
Um...

12:54.290 --> 12:56.590
This is really hard for me,
but I did something stupid.

12:56.630 --> 12:58.790
I kissed my ex-boyfriend.
It meant nothing, and I --

12:58.830 --> 13:02.100
Sorry, froze up again
in the funniest position.

13:02.130 --> 13:04.270
You look like you'd smelled
something dreadful.

13:04.300 --> 13:05.940
Have another go.
Okay.

13:05.970 --> 13:08.270
- I messed up, and I kiss--
- Wait!

13:08.300 --> 13:09.610
Okay, go.

13:09.640 --> 13:10.970
I kissed
my ex-boyfriend!

13:12.480 --> 13:15.280
Damn it,
stop freezing!

13:15.310 --> 13:17.950
Not frozen.

13:17.980 --> 13:19.980
Shocked.

13:20.020 --> 13:21.780
Very hurt, actually.

13:21.820 --> 13:23.290
I'm so sorry.

13:23.320 --> 13:25.120
It meant nothing.
Can --

13:25.150 --> 13:26.620
Can we please
move past this?

13:26.660 --> 13:27.660
I don't know.

13:27.690 --> 13:29.790
Um, we said that
we loved each other.

13:29.830 --> 13:31.630
I-I trusted you.

13:31.660 --> 13:34.130
What I want to do is hang up
on you right now.

13:34.160 --> 13:35.460
Wait, I --

13:40.000 --> 13:41.140
Well, I told him, and it
couldn't have gone worse.

13:41.170 --> 13:42.140
-Oh, no.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

13:42.170 --> 13:43.970
He broke up with you.
Not yet.

13:44.010 --> 13:45.840
He just
hung up on me.

13:45.880 --> 13:47.640
Oh, come here, honey.

13:47.680 --> 13:50.850
I'm -- I'm so sorry, and I know
why you didn't come to me.

13:50.880 --> 13:53.320
I haven't always been
Dylan's biggest fan.

13:53.350 --> 13:55.020
You pushed him
into a beehive.

13:55.050 --> 13:56.990
You know, to be fair,
I pushed him off of you,

13:57.020 --> 13:58.490
and he fell
into the beehive,

13:58.520 --> 14:02.360
but, regardless,
I want to be supportive.

14:02.390 --> 14:04.330
No judgment.
I promise. I promise.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.700
I can't believe
how stupid I was.

14:06.730 --> 14:08.160
I let Dylan
get in my head,

14:08.200 --> 14:10.000
and now I might have ruined
everything with Arvin.

14:10.030 --> 14:11.500
-Mnh.
-So...

14:11.530 --> 14:13.170
what we're learning
is that

14:13.200 --> 14:15.340
sometimes it is better
to keep the secret.

14:15.370 --> 14:17.510
You can't be
proud of that.

14:17.540 --> 14:19.010
Look, honey, sometimes
these things happen.

14:19.040 --> 14:20.180
They happened with them,

14:20.210 --> 14:21.680
but that turned out to be
a good thing.

14:21.710 --> 14:22.850
I'm sorry.
In what way?

14:22.880 --> 14:25.510
Because after Mitchell
kissed the guy in the bar,

14:25.550 --> 14:27.180
he called me crying,

14:27.220 --> 14:29.690
so tortured.

14:29.720 --> 14:31.220
He said
the second he did it,

14:31.250 --> 14:32.860
he knew
he wanted to spend

14:32.890 --> 14:35.220
the rest of his life
with Cam.

14:35.260 --> 14:36.860
Mitchell, is that true?
Why didn't you say that?

14:36.890 --> 14:39.860
Because we've been together
for 15 years, Cam.

14:39.900 --> 14:41.700
I got defensive.
I'm sorry.

14:41.730 --> 14:44.230
No. I'm sorry.

14:44.270 --> 14:45.530
You know,
I freaked out,

14:45.570 --> 14:47.870
and I made this whole day
about myself.

14:47.900 --> 14:51.070
And you're right -- I can be
self-centered and emotional.

14:51.910 --> 14:53.040
I guess it's, you know,

14:53.080 --> 14:55.540
because of all that time
my daddy spent with his pigs.

14:55.580 --> 14:56.580
Cam.
Please.

14:56.610 --> 14:57.880
It's time.
Mm-hmm.

15:00.250 --> 15:02.720
Haley, you're not
a bad person.

15:02.750 --> 15:05.250
Maybe this kiss taught you
something you needed to know,

15:05.290 --> 15:07.060
just like it did
with Uncle Mitch.

15:07.090 --> 15:08.760
If that's the case,

15:08.790 --> 15:11.060
you need to fight
for the man you love

15:11.090 --> 15:12.930
and shut it down
with the one you don't.

15:12.960 --> 15:14.730
You're right.
Mm-hmm.

15:14.760 --> 15:16.600
I have to go see Dylan.
Okay.

15:17.770 --> 15:20.270
Be strong.
Don't let him manipulate you.

15:20.300 --> 15:23.570
He can be a very em--
She's good.

15:23.610 --> 15:24.770
She's good.

15:26.780 --> 15:29.750
Ah, so happy
that you came out.

15:29.780 --> 15:31.080
What's going on
with you?

15:31.110 --> 15:32.750
Where did you
get that raft?

15:32.780 --> 15:36.250
It was in a gift bag from
a very moving Pride benefit

15:36.290 --> 15:38.090
that I went to
with Mitch and Cam.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.920
If you want to know if I'm gay,
just ask me.

15:39.960 --> 15:42.430
No, I don't want
to be pushy.

15:42.460 --> 15:44.260
I like women, Mom!

15:44.290 --> 15:45.930
Why on Earth
would you think I'm gay?

15:45.960 --> 15:48.600
In fairness, you do check
a lot of the boxes.

15:48.630 --> 15:50.270
I only thought it
because Jay said

15:50.300 --> 15:52.940
that the Canadian girlfriends
are fake

15:52.970 --> 15:55.100
and that Mitch and Cam
had them.

15:55.140 --> 15:56.770
You think
my girlfriend is fake?

15:56.810 --> 15:58.310
Well, you didn't have
any pictures,

15:58.340 --> 16:00.110
and at the bar,
you said that her name

16:00.140 --> 16:03.310
was something like
Olive Cocktail-napkin.

16:03.350 --> 16:04.950
It's Sherry Shaker!

16:04.980 --> 16:06.450
I am sorry,

16:06.480 --> 16:09.790
but when I asked you if you
were hiding something from me,

16:09.820 --> 16:12.790
you got all defensive,
and you boob-shamed me.

16:12.820 --> 16:14.790
Because something
did happen.

16:14.820 --> 16:16.630
Sherry and I...

16:16.660 --> 16:18.460
we joined our...

16:18.490 --> 16:20.130
We crossed that
beauteous threshold

16:20.160 --> 16:22.300
into the physical
expression of love.

16:22.330 --> 16:25.300
Have you ever heard a straight
guy describe sex that way?

16:25.330 --> 16:26.800
That's what
he meant?

16:26.840 --> 16:28.970
Why does that
feel worse to me?

16:29.000 --> 16:30.970
Hey, Alex.
You're the last virgin.

16:31.010 --> 16:33.980
Please,
I'm dating a fireman.

16:34.010 --> 16:35.510
I'm having
hotter sex than...

16:38.550 --> 16:39.820
Hey, Dad?

16:39.850 --> 16:41.180
What are you doing?

16:45.350 --> 16:47.820
He wouldn't.

16:47.860 --> 16:50.830
I realized he
was "Mean Girls-ing" me back

16:50.860 --> 16:52.660
with a weird nod
to "Legally Blonde,"

16:52.700 --> 16:54.500
which I'll bet he thinks
I didn't notice.

16:54.530 --> 16:56.000
I had to change tactics.

16:56.030 --> 16:57.330
I had to stop acting
like a mean girl

16:57.370 --> 16:59.840
and do the last thing Jay
would ever expect me to do --

16:59.870 --> 17:01.670
act like a man.

17:01.700 --> 17:03.010
What the hell
are you doing?!

17:03.040 --> 17:04.510
Oh, yeah, well,
everybody's hungry,

17:04.540 --> 17:06.010
and the prevailing opinion
is that

17:06.040 --> 17:07.380
I'm a better griller
than you.

17:07.410 --> 17:08.680
No.

17:08.710 --> 17:11.180
Wow. You must think
you're pretty tough.

17:11.210 --> 17:13.349
Not as tough
as your meat.
Claire!

17:13.380 --> 17:15.680
Yes, good,
everybody get out here!

17:15.720 --> 17:16.849
What?
What's going on?

17:16.890 --> 17:19.359
It's Phil!
Phil is grilling!

17:19.390 --> 17:21.359
This bozo just told me

17:21.390 --> 17:23.359
that you think
I overcook your meat.

17:23.390 --> 17:24.359
Is that true?

17:24.390 --> 17:25.859
-Uh...
-Uh...

17:27.230 --> 17:28.560
Luke?!

17:32.570 --> 17:34.570
Dad,
we love you, but...

17:35.240 --> 17:37.370
...you don't know
what medium-rare is.

17:37.410 --> 17:38.870
I've -- I've given you
a meat thermometer

17:38.910 --> 17:40.210
for three Father's Days
in a row.

17:40.240 --> 17:41.540
For the love of God,
just use one!

17:41.580 --> 17:43.550
Fine.
See if I care.

17:43.580 --> 17:46.050
But I don't know what
you have against me today --

17:46.080 --> 17:47.750
kicking a man
off his own grill,

17:47.780 --> 17:49.550
making fun
of my Mint Jay-leps.

17:49.590 --> 17:52.220
You made fun
of his Mint Jay-leps?

17:52.260 --> 17:53.920
He did them for you.

17:53.960 --> 17:56.060
What?
I don't know
what she's talking about.

17:56.090 --> 17:58.430
The minute Jay
created the Jay-leps,

17:58.460 --> 18:01.100
all he could
keep saying was,

18:01.130 --> 18:03.070
"Phil's gonna get
such a kick out of this."

18:03.100 --> 18:04.770
But he didn't!
He said it was dumb!

18:04.800 --> 18:06.600
He said it was
an old lady's drink!

18:06.640 --> 18:08.570
Since when do you care
what I think?

18:08.600 --> 18:09.770
Always!

18:09.810 --> 18:11.410
He thinks that you're
the life of the party.

18:11.440 --> 18:12.740
He wants
to be more like you.

18:12.780 --> 18:14.910
All I've said
is that sometimes

18:14.940 --> 18:17.750
I envy people
who don't mind being an ass

18:17.780 --> 18:19.080
because
they're having fun,

18:19.110 --> 18:20.750
and I guess...

18:20.780 --> 18:22.290
you're one
of those people.

18:22.320 --> 18:23.920
Wow, so all this time,

18:23.950 --> 18:26.760
you've been mean to me
because you admire me so much?

18:26.790 --> 18:29.790
Eh.
Hey, look at me.

18:29.830 --> 18:31.930
I loved
those Mint Jay-leps.

18:31.960 --> 18:33.430
You did?
Yeah.

18:33.460 --> 18:35.130
Did you hear that, Gloria?
He did.

18:35.160 --> 18:36.930
I only trashed them because
of what you called me

18:36.970 --> 18:38.270
when I was dancing
at the wedding.

18:38.300 --> 18:41.270
What? Flail Dunphy?
Shrill Dummy?

18:41.300 --> 18:42.770
When you dropped your drink --
Spill Bumbly?

18:42.810 --> 18:44.110
Michael Jerkson.

18:44.140 --> 18:45.770
Oh, yeah.
I forgot about that one.

18:45.810 --> 18:48.610
- I'm sorry.
- don't worry about it.

18:48.640 --> 18:49.780
What are we doing?

18:49.810 --> 18:51.810
Did you just
call me "Sport"?
Huh?

18:55.150 --> 18:56.290
Haley.

18:56.320 --> 18:57.950
I had a feeling
it was gonna be you.

18:57.990 --> 18:59.290
You buzzed me
in the gate.

18:59.320 --> 19:01.620
Do you have a minute?
Sure, my roommates and I

19:01.660 --> 19:03.660
are just studying
for physiology midterms.

19:03.690 --> 19:05.790
Oh, she cute.
Thanks, girl.

19:05.830 --> 19:06.960
That hair is on point.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.300
I bought it
yesterday.
Oh.

19:09.330 --> 19:10.800
Can we talk out here?

19:14.840 --> 19:16.470
Listen, I need you
to know that

19:16.510 --> 19:17.970
that kiss never
should have happened.

19:18.010 --> 19:20.980
Arvin and I are together,
and you and I are friends,

19:21.010 --> 19:22.650
and that's all
we're ever going to be.

19:22.680 --> 19:24.350
No, thank you.

19:24.380 --> 19:26.680
"No, thank you"?
I didn't ask you a question.

19:26.720 --> 19:28.350
Well, let me
ask you one.

19:28.380 --> 19:31.320
It's been 10 years,
and I can't move on from you.

19:31.350 --> 19:33.320
Also not a question.

19:33.360 --> 19:34.990
Remember
the day we met?

19:35.020 --> 19:36.160
I was walking
through the halls,

19:36.190 --> 19:38.330
and I saw
the most beautiful girl,

19:38.360 --> 19:40.330
and I was like,
"Whoa! Who is that?"

19:40.360 --> 19:42.530
And you were like,
"That's Rebecca Salkin."

19:42.570 --> 19:44.500
And then I turned and
saw you for the first time,

19:44.530 --> 19:46.540
and I was done
with Rebecca Salkin.

19:46.570 --> 19:50.170
Yeah, you were wearing that
cool, beat-up Army jacket,

19:50.210 --> 19:53.680
and I was completely jealous
of your eyelashes.

19:53.710 --> 19:55.510
Haley...

19:55.540 --> 19:58.350
I fell in love with you that
day, and I've never stopped.

19:58.380 --> 20:01.850
I'm gonna keep making myself
better until I deserve you.

20:03.750 --> 20:06.520
âªâª

20:06.560 --> 20:09.860
Haley: Why is it so hard
to be honest in relationships?

20:09.890 --> 20:11.690
We play games.

20:11.730 --> 20:13.100
We keep secrets...

20:15.230 --> 20:17.700
I don't remember
crying to you about that kiss.

20:17.730 --> 20:19.700
The truth wasn't
moving the needle.

20:19.740 --> 20:20.870
You're welcome.

20:20.900 --> 20:22.410
...when all we want to do
is connect.

20:22.440 --> 20:24.370
Everyone,
listen up!

20:24.410 --> 20:25.570
Sherry:
Hi, I'm Sherry.

20:25.610 --> 20:28.210
I'm Manny's real
Canadian girlfriend.

20:28.240 --> 20:30.050
This isn't the first time
I've had to do this.

20:30.080 --> 20:31.050
Claire: Hi!

20:31.080 --> 20:32.110
-Hi!
-Hi!

20:33.750 --> 20:38.390
I guess we have to start with
being honest with ourselves.

20:38.420 --> 20:39.960
And if I'm being honest...

20:41.760 --> 20:43.790
...I love two people.

20:45.090 --> 20:46.430
Damn it!

20:48.460 --> 20:50.430
Can we go?
Are we waiting for cake, or...?

20:50.470 --> 20:52.600
-Is it a birthday?
-Should I make a toast?

20:52.640 --> 20:53.600
-To what?
-To whom?

20:53.640 --> 20:57.070
All right! It's come to my attention
through a series of assumptions,

20:57.110 --> 21:00.080
old e-mails,
and lazy, sheep-like thinking

21:00.110 --> 21:02.750
that we may have
gathered for no reason.

21:02.780 --> 21:04.750
So, it's not
my welcome-home party?

21:04.780 --> 21:06.080
-Of course, it --
-Nope!

21:06.110 --> 21:08.080
Your mother thought Alex
won an award, she didn't,

21:08.120 --> 21:09.280
and the dry spell
continues.

21:09.320 --> 21:13.320
Please,
the last thing I'm having is a dry...spell.

21:14.320 --> 21:17.290
People, listen up.
There are too many actual reasons

21:17.330 --> 21:18.430
for us to see each other.

21:18.460 --> 21:21.260
We cannot afford
to hang out by mistake!

21:21.300 --> 21:23.130
I love you all.
Now go home.

21:23.170 --> 21:24.670
-Okay, well, great.
-All right, let's go.

21:24.671 --> 21:26.671
t1

21:26.672 --> 21:28.672
t3
