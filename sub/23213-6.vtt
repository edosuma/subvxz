WEBVTT

00:19.200 --> 00:20.360
You can go ahead.

00:23.280 --> 00:25.280
(GONG CLANGS)

00:29.360 --> 00:33.000
Right. Let's really open up
about our feelings

00:33.080 --> 00:35.000
in this session.

00:35.080 --> 00:37.600
Isn't our time up?
I thought I heard the gong.

00:37.680 --> 00:40.840
We'll happily sit here
until you feel ready
to open your heart to us.

00:42.360 --> 00:44.040
-Won't we, Bryn?
-Yeah.

00:44.120 --> 00:46.000
Before I came here,
life was a struggle.

00:47.800 --> 00:50.720
But now I know you're never
gonna find self-acceptance,

00:51.880 --> 00:54.440
unless you face your feelings.

00:54.520 --> 00:56.800
Makes me feel like
everything's broken.

00:58.240 --> 01:00.320
And that no matter
how hard I try,

01:01.480 --> 01:03.120
I'll never be able to fix it.

01:03.200 --> 01:04.960
CRESSIDA: Thank you
for your courage, Gabe.

01:05.040 --> 01:06.600
Come on, let's go eat.

01:14.520 --> 01:17.240
EVA: I hope it tastes better
than it looks.

01:17.320 --> 01:18.880
I'm sure it's delicious, Eva.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.040
Well, back home,
it's usually takeaways,

01:24.120 --> 01:27.760
followed by too many glasses
of Pinot Grigio.

01:27.840 --> 01:30.640
I don't suppose
there's any alcohol
in that green tea, is there?

01:31.800 --> 01:33.840
What could be more important

01:33.920 --> 01:36.080
than the food we put
into our bodies?

01:36.160 --> 01:40.200
If your life is so hectic,
there isn't time to cook
a healthy meal,

01:40.280 --> 01:42.880
then you must change your life.

01:59.440 --> 02:01.480
So this afternoon,
I want to focus

02:01.560 --> 02:03.800
on the healing power
of the breath.

02:05.160 --> 02:06.880
Enjoy your swim, my love.

02:07.560 --> 02:08.840
Enjoy your meditation.

02:10.520 --> 02:13.440
CRESSIDA: So let's begin
in the usual way

02:13.520 --> 02:15.320
by closing our eyes.

02:15.400 --> 02:19.520
(INHALES) And taking
a few deep breaths.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.480
And you can slowly...

02:39.400 --> 02:40.880
open your eyes.

02:43.320 --> 02:44.920
(EXHALES)

02:48.240 --> 02:50.560
Gabe, would you care to join me
in making a small offering

02:50.640 --> 02:52.280
in the Contemplation Garden?

02:56.000 --> 02:59.640
So if we can achieve
one thing for you
during your time here, Gabe,

02:59.720 --> 03:01.040
what would it be?

03:01.120 --> 03:02.560
Peace of mind, I suppose.

03:02.640 --> 03:03.800
Same as everyone.

03:03.880 --> 03:06.160
I don't know that
it is the same for everyone.

03:06.240 --> 03:08.720
People come here for
all sorts of different...

03:09.520 --> 03:10.960
-Daniel?
-Wait here.

03:18.760 --> 03:19.960
He's dead.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.040
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

03:52.840 --> 03:54.880
Tonight, we celebrate a man

03:54.960 --> 03:57.840
who quite literally needs
no introduction.

03:57.920 --> 04:01.160
However, I've got the job
of giving him one.

04:01.240 --> 04:04.200
What can you say about
Commissioner Selwyn Patterson?

04:06.040 --> 04:08.440
That's not a rhetorical
question, Harry.

04:08.520 --> 04:09.800
I need some help here.

04:11.320 --> 04:14.240
Selwyn Patterson is inscrutable.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.480
A hard taskmaster.

04:16.560 --> 04:17.880
Doesn't suffer fools.

04:17.960 --> 04:19.040
(GROANS)

04:19.120 --> 04:20.680
I'm supposed to be bigging
the man up here.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.920
All right.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.320
Sir.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.400
Oh, perfect timing, Florence.
Just the person I need.

04:25.480 --> 04:27.920
This speech I've got to make
for the Commissioner's Award.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.840
-What about it?
-Well, it's driving me mad.

04:29.920 --> 04:31.800
In two days' time,
I've got to stand up

04:31.880 --> 04:33.360
in front of the great and good
of Saint Marie

04:33.440 --> 04:35.440
and say what a special man
the commissioner is.

04:35.520 --> 04:37.320
I don't have a notion
where to start.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.240
I mean, how am I supposed
to make a speech

04:39.320 --> 04:40.880
about someone I hardly know?

04:40.960 --> 04:42.440
I don't know sir, I'm sorry.

04:42.520 --> 04:44.520
I'm just going to have
to clear the decks

04:44.600 --> 04:47.160
and spend every minute
of the next two days
working on it.

04:47.240 --> 04:49.200
Sir, someone's been found dead.

04:49.280 --> 04:50.520
-Oh.
-At a place called

04:50.600 --> 04:52.760
the Calming Breath
Spiritual Retreat.

04:52.840 --> 04:54.240
It's up on the North Shore.

04:55.360 --> 04:56.880
Well, to the North Shore
we must go then.

05:01.080 --> 05:04.000
FLORENCE: I heard it's been here
for three years.

05:04.080 --> 05:06.800
So, what exactly happens
at a spiritual retreat?

05:06.880 --> 05:09.080
According their website,
it's a chance

05:09.160 --> 05:12.920
to re-energise your mind, body,
and spirit holistically.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.280
Sounds exhausting.

05:14.360 --> 05:15.720
So how much
would that set you back?

05:15.800 --> 05:17.440
Two thousand dollars a week.

05:17.520 --> 05:18.840
Two thousand?

05:18.920 --> 05:21.080
What, to have some hippie fellow
walking all over your back

05:21.160 --> 05:22.920
and sticking pins in your face?

05:23.320 --> 05:24.320
Really?

05:24.400 --> 05:26.080
(CHUCKLES)

05:26.160 --> 05:28.160
To be fair,
they're getting rid
of the gadgets,

05:28.240 --> 05:29.800
I can definitely see
the appeal of that.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.200
Our victim is a Daniel Friend.

05:35.280 --> 05:38.040
Thirty-five years old, British.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.600
He owns this place
with his wife, Cressida.

05:40.680 --> 05:41.680
Yeah.

05:41.760 --> 05:43.480
And she is the one
who found the body.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.000
JACK: Poor woman.

05:45.080 --> 05:46.920
Was she on her own
when she came across him?

05:47.000 --> 05:48.760
No, she was with
one of the other guests.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.640
They were on their way
to something called the...

05:50.720 --> 05:53.160
a contemplation garden.

05:53.240 --> 05:55.000
-A contemplation garden?
-I know.

05:55.080 --> 05:56.800
I did ask, Chief.

05:56.880 --> 05:59.840
But if I'm honest,
I didn't really
understand the answer.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.240
Ah.

06:04.320 --> 06:08.200
Ligature marks on the neck
in a band about an inch
and a half wide.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.720
Cause of death, strangulation.

06:11.840 --> 06:15.680
No defence wounds or any other
signs of injury.

06:15.760 --> 06:17.200
You would expect
a fella this size

06:17.280 --> 06:19.240
to put up some sort
of a fight, wouldn't you?

06:19.320 --> 06:21.320
Maybe the attacker
surprised him from behind.

06:22.240 --> 06:23.440
Possibly.

06:26.320 --> 06:27.520
His belt.

06:27.600 --> 06:29.880
It's the exact same width
as the marks on his neck.

06:29.960 --> 06:31.920
I assume he wasn't killed
with his own belt,

06:32.000 --> 06:33.400
what with him
wearing it and all.

06:34.480 --> 06:35.920
(SIGHS)

06:36.000 --> 06:38.320
Dwayne, if you're done here,
we can release the body.

06:38.400 --> 06:39.920
DWAYNE: Yes, Chief. On the way.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.400
Did you find anything
on his person?

06:41.480 --> 06:42.480
Uh, nothing, sir.

06:43.440 --> 06:45.360
But...

06:45.440 --> 06:47.360
I found this towel on the ground

06:47.440 --> 06:49.720
a few feet from where
the victim was lying.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.120
I assume he dropped it
when he was being attacked.

06:52.200 --> 06:53.840
JACK: So, what,
he was on his way for a swim?

06:53.920 --> 06:56.400
Maybe there's a pool somewhere
in the Contemplation Garden?

06:58.800 --> 07:02.280
Chief, a key.
I found it under the body.

07:02.360 --> 07:06.160
(SIGHS) For a lock,
or a padlock or something.

07:06.240 --> 07:07.400
We should dust it for prints.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.800
If it was underneath the victim,

07:10.880 --> 07:12.760
then it either belongs to him...

07:12.840 --> 07:14.280
Or to the killer.

07:14.360 --> 07:16.120
Huh? You would think.

07:16.200 --> 07:19.360
Dwayne, JP, why don't you finish
processing the scene,

07:19.440 --> 07:21.000
we should have a quick word
with the witnesses.

07:21.080 --> 07:23.320
Chief.

07:23.400 --> 07:26.840
JACK: So when was the last time
you all saw Mr Friend alive?

07:28.080 --> 07:29.560
It was about half past 2:00.

07:29.640 --> 07:32.040
CRESSIDA: We'd just
finished lunch.

07:32.120 --> 07:34.040
Daniel headed off
for a swim as usual.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.640
"As usual"?
It was a regular thing?

07:36.720 --> 07:38.440
Every day, same time.

07:38.520 --> 07:41.880
Daniel said a dip in the sea
was the best form of therapy
he knew.

07:41.960 --> 07:45.240
You have to go through
the Contemplation Garden
to get to the beach?

07:45.320 --> 07:48.680
No. No, you literally have to go
in another direction.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.960
So why was he heading
for the garden, then?

07:51.040 --> 07:52.640
I don't know, it's not like him.

07:52.720 --> 07:54.160
Daniel relished routine.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.640
And when Daniel left,
what were the rest of you doing?

07:56.720 --> 07:58.000
We were all together.

07:59.320 --> 08:01.520
GABE: Cressida was running
a meditation circle.

08:02.720 --> 08:04.040
(EXHALES)

08:04.920 --> 08:06.480
A meditation circle?

08:06.560 --> 08:08.600
Does that mean you all had
your eyes closed?

08:08.680 --> 08:09.800
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I guess.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.200
FLORENCE: And how long
did that last?

08:11.280 --> 08:12.960
About 30 minutes.

08:13.040 --> 08:15.440
And afterwards,
when you were done?

08:15.520 --> 08:16.840
(WIND CHIMES TINKLING)

08:18.560 --> 08:20.440
Gabe and I headed for a walk.

08:21.440 --> 08:22.880
That's when we found him.

08:23.960 --> 08:25.840
-Daniel?
-Wait here.

08:28.280 --> 08:30.000
He was just lying there.

08:30.080 --> 08:31.800
GABE: I checked for vital signs.

08:31.880 --> 08:33.160
Yeah, the first
we heard about it

08:33.240 --> 08:34.880
was when they came back
and told us.

08:34.960 --> 08:36.640
(CRESSIDA CRYING)

08:36.720 --> 08:38.080
And then Gabe
went to get his phone,

08:38.160 --> 08:40.160
and then that's when
we called your lot.

08:42.200 --> 08:45.000
Now, can any of you
think of a reason

08:45.080 --> 08:47.960
why someone might want
to murder Mr Friend?

08:48.040 --> 08:50.200
Well, I mean, I only met
the man yesterday,

08:50.280 --> 08:51.680
so, I mean, I hardly knew him.

08:51.760 --> 08:53.800
Same. I got here a few days ago

08:53.880 --> 08:56.240
but he didn't seem like the kind
of person to have enemies.

08:56.320 --> 08:57.880
And what about
outside the retreat?

08:57.960 --> 09:00.160
Was there anyone on the island
who he'd fallen out with?

09:00.240 --> 09:02.320
Uh, he didn't really know
anyone on the island.

09:03.240 --> 09:04.400
I see.

09:05.280 --> 09:06.720
So...

09:06.800 --> 09:09.360
that means the only people
on Saint Marie

09:09.440 --> 09:11.200
that Daniel actually knew

09:11.880 --> 09:13.040
were you four.

09:16.160 --> 09:17.360
But... Yes, but I mean,

09:17.440 --> 09:19.240
you don't think
it was one of us,

09:19.320 --> 09:22.200
because we were all out there
on the lawn when it happened.

09:22.280 --> 09:26.040
Forgive me. It's just, well...

09:26.120 --> 09:29.240
The thing is, we think
whoever strangled Daniel

09:29.320 --> 09:30.720
might have used
one of those belts

09:30.800 --> 09:32.720
you're all wearing to do it.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.400
And what with this being
such an isolated spot, and...

09:35.480 --> 09:38.920
as you said, Cressida,
Daniel keeping himself
to himself,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.720
well, when you put
all that together,

09:41.800 --> 09:43.800
I can't help thinking
that our killer

09:43.880 --> 09:45.840
is someone within the retreat.

09:55.440 --> 09:57.200
This one. It's missing a belt.

09:59.040 --> 10:00.440
Well, it was there this morning.

10:00.520 --> 10:01.960
Are you sure?

10:02.040 --> 10:04.160
I was doing laundry.
They were all here,
I'm sure of it.

10:04.240 --> 10:07.640
So you and your guests
are the only ones
who have access to this room?

10:07.720 --> 10:10.400
Florence, tell Dwayne and JP
to search the retreat

10:10.480 --> 10:11.840
high up and low down.

10:11.920 --> 10:13.560
Let's see if we can find
our missing belt.

10:14.840 --> 10:16.240
(SIGHS)

10:31.440 --> 10:33.840
Twenty past 2:00 this afternoon,

10:33.920 --> 10:36.440
Daniel Friend tucked his towel
under his arm

10:36.520 --> 10:38.360
and set off for his daily swim.

10:38.440 --> 10:41.760
But instead of going
to the beach
as he normally would...

10:41.840 --> 10:43.360
JACK: And for reasons
we don't yet know...

10:43.440 --> 10:46.440
He decided to head
to the retreat's
Contemplation Garden.

10:46.520 --> 10:47.840
JACK: Here.

10:47.920 --> 10:49.800
However, his journey
was cut short

10:49.880 --> 10:52.920
when he was accosted we think
by one of the other residents

10:53.000 --> 10:56.240
and strangled
to death just here.

10:57.480 --> 10:59.000
So, what do we have
on our victim?

10:59.080 --> 11:01.760
I haven't been able
to dig up that much so far.

11:01.840 --> 11:04.480
The retreat only has
a basic website

11:04.560 --> 11:07.440
and he seems to have
no presence on social media.

11:07.520 --> 11:10.160
Seems technology
was anathema to Mr Friend.

11:10.240 --> 11:12.560
Now, the only four people,
as far as we are aware

11:12.640 --> 11:15.280
who knew Daniel
are the three paying guests,

11:15.360 --> 11:16.480
and of course, his wife.

11:16.560 --> 11:17.880
Cressida Friend.

11:17.960 --> 11:20.440
A qualified yoga teacher.

11:20.520 --> 11:23.120
Their business accounts show
they opened the retreat

11:23.200 --> 11:24.880
using money from her trust fund.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.240
Trust fund?

11:26.320 --> 11:28.800
Apparently, her family are big
landowners in Dorset.

11:28.880 --> 11:31.800
Oh, well. In that case,
we should do
a full financial check.

11:31.880 --> 11:33.640
As an old mucker of mine
at the Met used to say,

11:33.720 --> 11:35.200
"Where there's money,
there's motive."

11:35.280 --> 11:37.240
What's a mucker?

11:37.320 --> 11:38.840
Oh, it's just
a friend, Florence.

11:38.920 --> 11:40.680
Like you and me.
We're a couple of muckers.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.240
Hmm, muckers? Okay.

11:43.480 --> 11:45.000
(SIGHS)

11:45.080 --> 11:46.800
Gabriel Lee, 26.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.400
Junior doctor.

11:48.480 --> 11:50.680
Currently taking
a year-long sabbatical

11:50.760 --> 11:51.880
from Bristol General.

11:51.960 --> 11:54.120
-Do we know why?
-Not yet.

11:54.200 --> 11:56.200
But I've got details
for his consultant.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.120
-I'll get in touch.
-Right.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.120
-So who's next?
-Um...

12:00.200 --> 12:02.640
Eva Ingram. Single.

12:03.360 --> 12:05.040
A successful entrepreneur

12:05.120 --> 12:07.960
who runs her own business
importing wine.

12:08.040 --> 12:10.400
She owns a number of shops
around the UK.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.720
And she arrived on the island
only yesterday?

12:12.800 --> 12:14.760
Claims she never
met Daniel before.

12:14.840 --> 12:16.480
We need to confirm that
for ourselves.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.680
And finally,

12:18.760 --> 12:20.920
Bryn Williams, 51.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.440
Lives in London,
but originally from...

12:24.520 --> 12:26.680
Pwell? Pwill? Pewell?

12:26.760 --> 12:27.760
I'm sorry, how do you say that?

12:27.840 --> 12:30.440
(CHUCKLES)
I have no idea. I'm Irish.

12:30.520 --> 12:31.600
Let's just say Wales.

12:32.520 --> 12:33.840
So, what do we have on Bryn?

12:33.920 --> 12:35.960
So far, not much.

12:36.040 --> 12:39.120
His Facebook page
states his profession
as a maths teacher,

12:39.200 --> 12:40.920
but I'm struggling
to find evidence of that.

12:43.120 --> 12:45.120
There are two
significant questions

12:45.200 --> 12:47.000
that lie at the heart
of this case, Florence.

12:47.080 --> 12:49.800
The first, if our victim
went to the beach for a swim,

12:49.880 --> 12:51.520
at the same time every day...

12:51.600 --> 12:53.840
Daniel headed off
for a swim as usual.

12:53.920 --> 12:57.000
...then who or what made him
change his mind today?

12:57.080 --> 12:58.360
And the second,

12:58.440 --> 13:01.240
if our killer is one
of these four people,

13:01.320 --> 13:04.400
who were sitting
in this meditation circle...

13:08.880 --> 13:11.760
then how did one of them
slip out unnoticed

13:11.840 --> 13:13.240
and commit murder?

13:21.840 --> 13:23.440
JP!

13:23.520 --> 13:24.720
You find anything yet?

13:26.640 --> 13:27.680
JP!

13:31.640 --> 13:32.760
JP?

13:38.040 --> 13:40.200
Oh.

13:40.280 --> 13:42.840
Why don't you make yourself
at home, JP?

13:42.920 --> 13:44.440
Put your feet up.

13:44.520 --> 13:47.960
And why don't I make you a nice
cold Planter's while I'm at it?

13:48.040 --> 13:49.360
I'm sorry, Dwayne.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.080
It's just, I started flicking
through this book

13:51.160 --> 13:52.400
and I just couldn't put it down.

13:52.480 --> 13:54.600
-Oh!
-It's really fascinating.

13:57.480 --> 13:59.440
Believe by Daniel Friend.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.640
The victim wrote it?

14:01.720 --> 14:03.160
Yes, he's got
a whole box of them.

14:03.240 --> 14:04.680
I think it's for
the guests to buy.

14:05.960 --> 14:09.280
"Using the power
of positive thinking

14:09.360 --> 14:11.280
"to access your life's goals"?

14:11.960 --> 14:13.600
Oh, come on.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.200
Uh, Dwayne,

14:15.280 --> 14:18.360
basically, it says that
if there's something
you want in life

14:18.440 --> 14:21.080
and you project it in your mind,

14:21.160 --> 14:23.160
you can actually make it happen.

14:23.240 --> 14:24.960
-Oh, really?
-Mm.

14:25.040 --> 14:26.360
Well, let's put it to the test.

14:28.040 --> 14:29.160
I'm projecting

14:29.920 --> 14:31.920
in my mind

14:32.000 --> 14:34.440
that JP will get up
off of his backside

14:34.520 --> 14:35.840
and start doing some work.

14:35.920 --> 14:37.040
(SIGHS)

14:39.440 --> 14:41.360
Amazing. It worked.

14:41.440 --> 14:43.200
Very funny, Dwayne.

14:43.280 --> 14:46.760
Well, never mind all that.
How did you get on here?

14:46.840 --> 14:48.160
Any sign of the belt?

14:48.240 --> 14:51.160
Well, I found a whole load
of Daniel's papers and journals.

14:51.240 --> 14:53.200
And I boxed them up,
but no belt.

14:53.280 --> 14:55.160
-You?
-Diddly squat.

14:55.240 --> 14:57.600
We better get back
to the station and update
the chief, you know.

14:59.600 --> 15:00.720
Positive thinking.

15:09.840 --> 15:11.360
DWAYNE: I'm sorry, Chief.

15:11.440 --> 15:15.240
We searched inside, outside,
upstairs and downstairs.

15:15.960 --> 15:18.080
It has to be there.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.960
If our killer is...

15:20.040 --> 15:21.880
Well, then how, when, and where

15:21.960 --> 15:23.600
did they manage
to dispose of the belt

15:23.680 --> 15:26.360
when none of them left
the retreat after the murder?

15:26.440 --> 15:27.880
It doesn't make any sense.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.680
Okay, let's call it a day,

15:30.760 --> 15:32.280
crack on anew in the morning.

15:32.360 --> 15:33.800
DWAYNE: Chief.

15:33.880 --> 15:35.160
Have you got something
there, Florence?

15:35.240 --> 15:38.400
It's from the items JP found
in Daniel's room.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.360
-It's a notebook.
-Shorthand.

15:41.880 --> 15:43.680
Well, we should see
if we can get it deciphered.

15:43.760 --> 15:44.880
Will do.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.160
DWAYNE: Uh, Sarge.

15:47.240 --> 15:48.920
We're going for a quick drink
to Catherine's bar.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.120
Fancy joining us?

15:50.200 --> 15:51.960
No, I might stay
and make a couple of calls.

15:52.040 --> 15:53.800
-Chief?
-Oh, I'd love to, Dwayne.

15:53.880 --> 15:55.480
But this speech is not
going to write itself.

15:55.560 --> 15:57.040
Commissioner's Award
is in two days.

15:57.120 --> 15:59.480
Well, a small rum might be

15:59.560 --> 16:03.360
just what you need
to get your creative juices
flowing, eh? Hmm?

16:03.440 --> 16:05.040
Oh, maybe you're right, Dwayne.

16:05.120 --> 16:07.320
Maybe that's exactly
what I need. Yeah.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.880
Just a small one, now.

16:08.960 --> 16:11.760
Absolutely, Chief.
Just a small one.

16:11.840 --> 16:12.880
-Or two.
-Or three.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.120
JACK: Hmm.

16:28.640 --> 16:30.680
Morning, sir.

16:30.760 --> 16:33.120
You look terrible.
Have you slept?

16:33.200 --> 16:34.840
Yeah. I think I might
have nodded off

16:34.920 --> 16:36.680
for about five minutes
around 4:00.

16:36.760 --> 16:37.920
Four?

16:38.000 --> 16:39.880
You haven't been working
on your speech all night?

16:39.960 --> 16:42.200
We've come to the point
where words cease
to have any meaning.

16:42.280 --> 16:44.280
They're just dancing
in front of my eyes.

16:44.360 --> 16:46.560
But then,
just before you arrived,
a breakthrough.

16:46.640 --> 16:48.920
-Really?
-I decided to seek
professional help.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.920
This guy, he's written
biographies about everyone

16:51.000 --> 16:52.600
from Churchill to George Best.

16:52.680 --> 16:55.600
He says the key to writing
about someone

16:55.680 --> 16:57.720
is to know your subject
inside out.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.200
Get to know them intimately.

16:59.280 --> 17:01.120
And how are you going
to do that?

17:01.200 --> 17:03.880
Oh, I'm going to invite
the commissioner to spend
some quality time with me.

17:03.960 --> 17:05.680
Anyway, we've got
more pressing issues.

17:05.760 --> 17:06.800
How did you get on last night?

17:06.880 --> 17:08.560
I paid my cousin a visit.

17:08.640 --> 17:10.440
He's a clerk
at Honore Town Court.

17:10.520 --> 17:12.720
And did he mange to translate
Daniel's scribbling?

17:12.800 --> 17:16.440
Well, first off,
I don't think this was
written by Daniel Friend.

17:16.520 --> 17:19.520
It's mainly about him,
and it's written
in the third person.

17:19.600 --> 17:22.040
So someone was keeping
a journal about Daniel.

17:22.120 --> 17:24.560
It's all about their stay
as a guest at the retreat.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.360
And it's very critical of him.

17:26.440 --> 17:29.240
And is there any way
of working out
who the author might be?

17:29.320 --> 17:31.760
All the guest
are mentioned in it.

17:31.840 --> 17:33.120
Except for one.

17:34.440 --> 17:35.520
Bryn Williams.

17:38.200 --> 17:39.840
Bryn Williams.

17:44.480 --> 17:48.040
Yesterday you said
that Bryn's social media

17:48.120 --> 17:50.120
maintained he was
a maths teacher.

17:50.200 --> 17:51.280
(SPRAYS DEODORANT)

17:51.360 --> 17:53.160
But you didn't find
any evidence of that.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.240
No, nothing.

17:54.320 --> 17:55.720
I wonder.

17:57.040 --> 17:59.680
Very few jobs left
that call for shorthand.

18:01.440 --> 18:03.400
But the one trade
that still uses it

18:04.560 --> 18:05.800
is journalism.

18:09.400 --> 18:10.600
Nothing.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.440
William Bryn, maybe?

18:17.640 --> 18:18.920
His pseudonym.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.280
All right, you drive.

18:22.360 --> 18:25.440
I'm going to make a call
to an old press officer
friend of mine back in London.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.800
See if I can find a number
for Mr William's editor.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.840
That's got nothing to do
with what happened with Daniel.

18:40.400 --> 18:41.680
No?

18:41.760 --> 18:43.240
Because from where I'm standing,

18:43.320 --> 18:46.000
this gives you a pretty strong
motive for murder.

18:46.080 --> 18:48.560
-You're joking, right?
-Not in the slightest.

18:48.640 --> 18:50.080
How about you start
by explaining

18:50.160 --> 18:52.560
why your notebook
was in Daniel's possession?

18:52.640 --> 18:53.760
Was he on to you?

18:53.840 --> 18:54.920
(BRYN SIGHS DEEPLY)

18:56.400 --> 18:57.560
I don't know how,

18:57.640 --> 18:59.760
but he sussed that
I was onto something, yeah.

18:59.840 --> 19:01.280
Like ourselves, he sussed

19:01.360 --> 19:03.040
that you weren't
the common or garden
maths teacher

19:03.120 --> 19:04.360
you claimed to be.

19:04.440 --> 19:06.400
Well, he worked out
that I was writing an expose.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.160
And he confronted you.

19:08.240 --> 19:10.480
You know, for a man
who spent his time
banging on about inner peace,

19:10.560 --> 19:11.680
he didn't half get angry.

19:11.760 --> 19:12.920
And what did he say?

19:13.000 --> 19:15.320
He told me to get on
the next flight home ASAP.

19:15.400 --> 19:17.560
-When did this happen?
-A couple of days ago.

19:17.640 --> 19:18.840
So how come you're still here?

19:19.880 --> 19:21.680
We came to an arrangement.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.640
I offered to write
a complimentary article
about the place.

19:24.720 --> 19:25.920
Right, yes.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.120
And why didn't you inform
your editor about this?

19:29.200 --> 19:31.280
-I just spoke with him
half an hour ago.
-Really?

19:31.360 --> 19:33.760
Yeah, he had no idea
Daniel was onto you.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.680
But he did have some
very interesting information
to pass on about you.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.640
Like how things
aren't going too well

19:38.720 --> 19:40.360
in your personal life
at the moment.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.320
Halfway through a divorce,

19:42.400 --> 19:44.400
about to lose custody
of your children.

19:44.480 --> 19:46.760
And your work was suffering
as a result.

19:46.840 --> 19:49.680
According to him,
this undercover gig
here at the retreat

19:49.760 --> 19:51.200
was pretty much
the last chance saloon.

19:51.280 --> 19:53.960
So Daniel Friend
blowing your cover
and sending you packing,

19:54.040 --> 19:55.600
I imagine that's
the last thing you need.

19:57.120 --> 19:58.400
I can see how this might look.

19:58.480 --> 20:01.640
It looks, Bryn,
despite your protestations,

20:01.720 --> 20:03.520
that you benefit
from Daniel Friend's death.

20:03.960 --> 20:05.240
Big time.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.840
Man is clearly
desperate, Florence.

20:09.920 --> 20:12.640
But is he desperate enough
to commit murder?

20:12.720 --> 20:14.560
-Morning, Cressida.
-Morning.

20:14.640 --> 20:17.720
Wow, they're really... Really...

20:17.800 --> 20:19.440
What are they, exactly?

20:19.520 --> 20:21.680
Oh, we call them emotional
expression sculptures.

20:21.760 --> 20:23.080
They're from
an art therapy class

20:23.160 --> 20:25.160
I ran with Bryn
and Gabe yesterday.

20:25.240 --> 20:27.040
Emotional expression sculptures.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.320
Ah.

20:29.960 --> 20:32.720
I thought
I'd put them out in the sun
so they can dry quicker.

20:32.800 --> 20:33.840
Anything to keep busy.

20:35.520 --> 20:38.040
Inspector?

20:38.120 --> 20:41.120
The day before yesterday,
I happened to see Gabe
with Daniel, and...

20:41.880 --> 20:43.200
(YELLING INDISTINCTLY)

20:43.280 --> 20:45.280
CRESSIDA: It looked like Gabe
was pretty livid at him.

20:45.360 --> 20:49.120
Gabe was pointing and jabbing
Daniel in the chest.

20:49.200 --> 20:50.320
What time was this?

20:50.400 --> 20:52.200
About 10:30 in the morning.

20:52.280 --> 20:54.120
Did you hear any
of what was said?

20:54.200 --> 20:56.120
No, but...

20:56.200 --> 20:58.960
CRESSIDA: The thing is,
Gabe then walked out
of the retreat.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.520
We didn't see him again
till yesterday morning.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.920
He just disappeared
for 24 hours.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.200
And did you ask Daniel
about this?

21:05.280 --> 21:07.360
He said it was nothing
to worry about.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.240
But you think
there was something to it?

21:09.320 --> 21:11.560
Some issue between them?

21:11.640 --> 21:14.680
All I know is, he still had
a lot of anger in him
when he made this.

21:31.920 --> 21:34.920
I'll chase the consultant
at the hospital Gabe works at.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.840
Yeah, let's see how Dwayne
and JP are getting on

21:36.920 --> 21:39.560
with his phone records
and financial checks.

21:39.640 --> 21:41.400
Anything that might tell us
where Gabe went

21:41.480 --> 21:43.560
during that missing 24 hours.

21:45.040 --> 21:46.200
Commissioner.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.400
What an unexpected pleasure.

21:49.480 --> 21:53.040
I wondered if you might
have five minutes
for a chat, Inspector.

21:53.120 --> 21:54.880
Well, for you, sir,
I've got the whole day.

21:55.640 --> 21:57.760
Excuse me, gentlemen.

22:05.920 --> 22:06.920
(JACK CLEARS THROAT)

22:11.000 --> 22:12.960
As I'm sure you can imagine,

22:13.040 --> 22:15.880
receiving the Island Special
Award tomorrow night

22:15.960 --> 22:17.880
is a great honour for me.

22:17.960 --> 22:18.960
Of course.

22:19.040 --> 22:21.280
I am not by nature
a sentimental man.

22:21.360 --> 22:22.960
-No.
-And yet, I must admit,

22:23.040 --> 22:25.600
I am deeply moved
by this acknowledgement.

22:25.680 --> 22:27.080
I can only imagine.

22:27.160 --> 22:30.600
So you can see why I would hate
to see the evening marred

22:31.080 --> 22:32.360
in any way.

22:32.440 --> 22:34.000
Well, goes without saying, sir.

22:34.880 --> 22:36.880
Mayor Bordey tells me

22:36.960 --> 22:39.800
you are giving the speech
before the award is presented.

22:39.880 --> 22:42.200
That's right, yes,
and don't you worry.

22:42.280 --> 22:43.800
It's coming along a treat.

22:43.880 --> 22:45.800
I've got some lovely
material already.

22:47.520 --> 22:48.800
Although...

22:49.600 --> 22:52.320
Why, is there an "although"?

22:52.400 --> 22:55.120
Well, I just have
the tiniest concern

22:55.200 --> 22:58.960
that parts of it are a bit,
well, general.

22:59.040 --> 23:01.880
And I couldn't help feeling
that if you and I
could sit down,

23:01.960 --> 23:03.320
have a drink,

23:03.400 --> 23:04.840
Catherine's bar, say.

23:10.680 --> 23:11.920
It's on.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.320
Me and the commissioner,
7:00 p.m, Catherine's bar.

23:14.400 --> 23:15.600
-Really?
-Yeah.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.360
A couple of rums,
some gentle encouragement,

23:17.440 --> 23:19.160
he'll be regaling me
with anecdotes.

23:19.240 --> 23:20.440
I'll have him singing
like a bird.

23:21.640 --> 23:23.160
He asked the commissioner
for a drink?

23:24.000 --> 23:25.760
-(PHONE RINGING)
-Excuse me.

23:25.840 --> 23:27.800
So, what's the story?

23:27.880 --> 23:29.920
JP, is that a postmortem
I see before me?

23:30.000 --> 23:31.360
Yes, it is,

23:31.440 --> 23:34.480
and it confirms Daniel Friend
died due to asphyxiation.

23:34.560 --> 23:36.800
Also, the fibres found
around the victim's neck

23:36.880 --> 23:38.480
are the same kind of fabric used

23:38.560 --> 23:40.400
to make the rope belts
at the retreat.

23:40.480 --> 23:41.720
Except, we still have no idea

23:41.800 --> 23:43.640
how the murderer managed
to get rid of the belt

23:43.720 --> 23:45.120
when not one of them
left the retreat.

23:45.640 --> 23:46.920
Oh.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.920
Also, I dusted the key
as requested.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.520
And?

23:50.600 --> 23:52.760
There's only one set
of prints on them,
and they're Daniel's.

23:52.840 --> 23:56.240
Now, if we can only figure out
what exactly it unlocks.

23:56.320 --> 23:57.840
There's a locksmith in town,
isn't there?

23:57.920 --> 23:59.400
Ah, yes. Dread Locks.

23:59.480 --> 24:01.240
Why don't you pop down
as soon as you get a chance

24:01.320 --> 24:02.360
and see if he can
give us a steer?

24:02.440 --> 24:03.600
JP: Okay.

24:03.680 --> 24:04.840
-Sir?
-Yes, Florence.

24:04.920 --> 24:07.440
I have an e-mail
back from Bristol General.

24:07.520 --> 24:11.040
Gabe took his sabbatical
after his twin sister, Ruth,

24:11.120 --> 24:12.560
died six months ago.

24:12.640 --> 24:15.640
Apparently,
he was finding it hard
to get over her death.

24:15.720 --> 24:17.080
She took her own life.

24:17.160 --> 24:18.760
Oh, what a terrible thing.

24:18.840 --> 24:21.880
And here's a link to a website
Gabe set up in her memory.

24:22.720 --> 24:24.360
Poor girl. And so young.

24:24.440 --> 24:26.560
Makes sense of what he was doing
at the retreat.

24:26.640 --> 24:28.920
Trying to deal with his grief,
I suppose.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.760
DWAYNE: Yes, see you there.

24:30.840 --> 24:32.640
Chief, I've got
something for you.

24:32.720 --> 24:35.440
So I checked Gabe's
phone records,
like you suggested,

24:35.520 --> 24:38.960
and the only phone call
he made on the morning
he went off the radar

24:39.040 --> 24:40.880
was to one of the local
taxi firms.

24:40.960 --> 24:43.000
Apparently, he wanted to be
dropped off at the nearest bar.

24:43.080 --> 24:44.920
-Which is?
-The Blue Parrot.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.560
You want us to go over there
and see if we can find out
anything else, Chief?

24:47.640 --> 24:49.000
It's like you can read my mind.

24:50.360 --> 24:51.920
Impossible.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.120
JP. Let's go.

24:54.200 --> 24:55.680
JACK: Hmm.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.480
Oh, yes, of course.

24:57.560 --> 24:58.880
Little Michael
who runs the place

24:58.960 --> 25:00.600
just got three months for theft.

25:00.680 --> 25:03.200
Oy, oy, oy.

25:03.280 --> 25:05.400
His brother Tino
must be running it.

25:05.480 --> 25:08.120
And nothing keeps Tino
away from his cricket.

25:08.200 --> 25:10.200
Okay, let's go
and find him, then.

25:10.280 --> 25:12.560
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

25:12.640 --> 25:14.360
He could be anywhere
on the island.

25:14.440 --> 25:16.320
His sister's place,
his brother's,

25:16.400 --> 25:17.760
either of his girlfriends.

25:17.840 --> 25:21.600
Okay, well, I guess we just

25:21.680 --> 25:23.920
wait here till Tino turns up.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.440
You know,

25:29.520 --> 25:31.600
I was reading a little bit more
of this book last night, Dwayne.

25:31.680 --> 25:33.360
Positive thinking.

25:33.440 --> 25:36.840
And it says, if things aren't
exactly working out
the way you want,

25:36.920 --> 25:40.440
there are these visualisation
exercises you can use.

25:40.520 --> 25:43.720
And how the hell is that
going to be of any use
to us now?

25:43.800 --> 25:46.360
Well, what we want
is for Tino to turn up

25:46.440 --> 25:47.680
so we can ask him
some questions.

25:47.760 --> 25:49.000
-Uh-huh.
-So...

25:50.360 --> 25:52.280
If I close my eyes

25:52.360 --> 25:54.080
and I picture the path ahead,

25:55.440 --> 25:58.200
and I visualise Tino walking
around the bend...

25:58.920 --> 26:00.760
Okay, yes.

26:00.840 --> 26:03.560
Yeah, okay.
So now I've visualised it,

26:03.640 --> 26:06.040
what I've willed to happen
should actually happen.

26:06.120 --> 26:07.240
Oh.

26:08.760 --> 26:09.960
Okay.

26:17.680 --> 26:19.160
JP: Hmm.

26:20.200 --> 26:22.000
Maybe you should try
another book.

26:22.080 --> 26:24.920
Yeah, I probably
to do, you know,
a bit more practise on it.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.400
That's an understatement.

26:29.440 --> 26:30.800
No way.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.360
Is that Tino?

26:32.440 --> 26:33.880
That's him! The Rasta!

26:33.960 --> 26:35.720
Oh, my. It actually worked!

26:37.120 --> 26:38.480
This is hard to believe.

26:39.280 --> 26:40.720
FLORENCE: Sir.

26:40.800 --> 26:44.160
Have you ever heard of a thing
called confrontation therapy?

26:44.240 --> 26:46.200
Yeah, a colleague of mine
tried it after a tough case.

26:46.280 --> 26:47.400
Why?

26:47.480 --> 26:49.080
Well, I've been looking
at the retreat schedule,

26:49.160 --> 26:51.880
and at 9:00 a.m
the morning Gabe disappeared

26:51.960 --> 26:54.880
he was booked in for
a one-to-one therapy session
with Daniel.

26:54.960 --> 26:57.560
Which would have been
just before Cressida
saw them arguing.

26:57.640 --> 27:00.440
So, what does
confrontation therapy involve?

27:00.520 --> 27:02.320
Well, as far as I can tell,

27:02.400 --> 27:05.360
it's about taking responsibility
for your problems.

27:05.440 --> 27:06.480
It's pretty extreme.

27:06.560 --> 27:08.280
A lot of shrinks reckon
it's dangerous.

27:08.360 --> 27:11.520
Especially if the subject
is trying to deal
with a significant trauma.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.240
Like the death of a sister.

27:13.320 --> 27:14.960
Like the death
of a twin sister, yeah.

27:16.160 --> 27:18.080
Okay, Chief, we just spoke
to the barman,

27:18.160 --> 27:20.440
who was there on the day
Gabe Lee turned up.

27:20.520 --> 27:21.720
A guy called Tino.

27:21.800 --> 27:23.160
And what did Tino have to say?

27:23.240 --> 27:25.560
That Gabe was clearly very angry
when he arrived at the bar.

27:25.640 --> 27:27.480
And the more he drank,
the angrier he got.

27:27.560 --> 27:29.960
Apparently, he spent
the whole time telling Tino

27:30.040 --> 27:32.400
exactly how much
he hated Daniel Friend.

27:32.480 --> 27:33.720
And get this,

27:33.800 --> 27:35.840
Gabe's very last words
before he left the bar was,

27:35.920 --> 27:37.680
"Daniel Friend
has got it coming."

27:43.880 --> 27:45.000
JACK: What are you planting?

27:46.200 --> 27:48.160
Celery or peas?

27:51.240 --> 27:52.680
Sorry to hear about your sister.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.800
Why? You didn't know her.

27:58.080 --> 28:00.800
Well, I know how complicated
grief can be.

28:02.200 --> 28:03.680
It's not just the pain.

28:03.760 --> 28:05.000
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

28:05.080 --> 28:07.200
It's the anger and regret.

28:08.360 --> 28:09.480
The guilt.

28:12.880 --> 28:15.000
She'd split up
with her boyfriend.

28:15.080 --> 28:17.280
They'd been together
a couple of years, and...

28:18.120 --> 28:20.000
He really messed her around.

28:20.080 --> 28:21.560
She kept telling me
she was fine.

28:22.800 --> 28:25.080
But she wasn't.

28:25.160 --> 28:27.320
And I should have seen that,
that's what I regret.

28:29.320 --> 28:31.120
Coming here, has it helped?

28:31.200 --> 28:33.800
I understand you were having
therapy sessions with Daniel.

28:34.640 --> 28:35.880
Confrontation therapy.

28:37.480 --> 28:40.560
Daniel kept talking about
taking responsibility.

28:42.160 --> 28:45.040
How we can't move on
unless we do.

28:45.120 --> 28:47.880
Felt like he was telling me
it was my fault
my sister killed herself.

28:49.360 --> 28:51.480
And this is what prompted
your argument with Daniel?

28:51.560 --> 28:54.840
It's not my fault. It's yours!

28:54.920 --> 28:58.920
Just before you left the retreat
and headed for the...

28:59.000 --> 28:59.960
Blue Parrot.

29:01.360 --> 29:02.480
I knew that...

29:03.720 --> 29:05.560
if I'd stayed, that I'd...

29:05.640 --> 29:06.920
-What, hit him?
-Yes.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.240
-Or worse.
-No.

29:09.320 --> 29:13.000
No, I left so I could
get him out of my sight,
so I could calm down.

29:13.080 --> 29:15.560
Yeah, but you didn't calm down,
did you, Gabe?

29:15.640 --> 29:18.320
Tino at the Blue Parrot told us
that hours after the argument,

29:18.400 --> 29:21.040
you were still
ranting and raving,
angry towards Daniel.

29:21.120 --> 29:22.880
But I didn't kill him.

29:22.960 --> 29:24.680
Even if I wanted to,
I couldn't have.

29:24.760 --> 29:27.640
I was sitting in that
meditation circle
with everyone else, wasn't I?

29:30.760 --> 29:31.960
(SIGHS)

29:32.040 --> 29:34.920
Gabe is right, Florence.
We've got four suspects.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.400
Each of them has an alibi,
the same alibi

29:37.480 --> 29:38.960
for the time the murder
was committed.

29:39.040 --> 29:41.200
They were all sat together
in a meditation circle

29:41.280 --> 29:42.480
inside the retreat.

29:42.560 --> 29:45.000
Exactly. So just how
did one of them do it?

29:45.080 --> 29:47.480
Sir, I've just come back
from the locksmith,

29:47.560 --> 29:50.840
and he said this type of key
would fit some kind of cash box.

29:50.920 --> 29:52.360
-A cash box?
-Hmm.

29:52.440 --> 29:54.760
But you searched the retreat.
Did you spot anything like that?

29:54.840 --> 29:56.760
-I'm afraid not, sir.
-Great.

29:56.840 --> 29:58.640
So as well as the belt that
was used to kill the victim,

29:58.720 --> 30:00.040
we now have a cash box.

30:00.120 --> 30:01.480
Two items that have
gone missing.

30:01.560 --> 30:04.040
Chief, I finished going through
all the phone records

30:04.120 --> 30:06.120
and e-mail correspondence
from the retreat.

30:06.200 --> 30:08.240
-Anything of interest?
-Just one thing.

30:08.320 --> 30:10.040
Two months ago,
someone from the retreat

30:10.120 --> 30:11.680
called the emergency services.

30:11.760 --> 30:13.120
Now, it wasn't for us.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.520
So that means it was either
for the fire brigade,

30:15.600 --> 30:16.840
or an ambulance.

30:16.920 --> 30:18.600
-Do we know which?
-I'm waiting for a return call.

30:18.680 --> 30:20.320
Okay, well, let's see
what turns up there.

30:20.400 --> 30:22.120
Yes, Chief.

30:22.200 --> 30:24.960
So how we getting on sorting
through Daniel's paperwork?

30:25.040 --> 30:26.560
Ah, we've gone through
the first box,

30:26.640 --> 30:28.840
which has all his papers
since he moved here.

30:28.920 --> 30:30.040
Nothing before that.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.760
I haven't started
on the second box yet.

30:31.840 --> 30:34.240
Well, I guess that's my homework
for tonight, then.

30:34.320 --> 30:37.320
Oh, sir, don't forget your drink
with the commissioner.

30:37.400 --> 30:40.440
Sort the speech out first,
and then I get stuck
into that lot.

30:43.480 --> 30:46.320
JACK: I'm just trying to get
a sense of you as a civilian,

30:46.400 --> 30:47.840
as well as a commissioner.

30:47.920 --> 30:49.880
What do you look like
when you take off your uniform?

30:50.520 --> 30:51.520
Excuse me?

30:52.720 --> 30:54.080
Could have put that better.

30:54.160 --> 30:56.040
Erm... No,
I just want to get a feel

30:56.120 --> 30:57.640
for the real Selwyn Patterson.

30:57.720 --> 30:59.280
I mean, I don't even know
if you're married.

30:59.360 --> 31:00.320
Why would you?

31:03.560 --> 31:05.640
Well, why don't you take me back
to where it all began?

31:05.720 --> 31:07.200
Were you born here
on the island?

31:07.280 --> 31:08.280
Yes.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.520
And do you have any family
nearby, or...

31:11.600 --> 31:13.440
No.

31:13.520 --> 31:16.800
So, what are some
of your earliest memories?

31:18.720 --> 31:20.520
I'm not sure that's relevant.

31:20.600 --> 31:23.400
You're hardly going to use that
in your speech, are you?

31:23.480 --> 31:25.320
Ah, Catherine.

31:25.400 --> 31:26.640
Here we are, gentlemen.

31:26.720 --> 31:28.120
Thank you, Mayor Bordey.

31:28.840 --> 31:30.960
So, what's the occasion?

31:31.040 --> 31:33.080
I have been helping
the inspector

31:33.160 --> 31:35.040
put the final touches
to his speech

31:35.120 --> 31:36.200
for tomorrow night.

31:36.280 --> 31:37.680
But it's getting late.

31:41.040 --> 31:42.680
Ah.

31:42.760 --> 31:43.880
I hope I've been of use.

31:43.960 --> 31:45.320
Yes, very helpful.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.760
(JACK CHUCKLES)

31:49.840 --> 31:51.120
Marvellous.

31:51.200 --> 31:52.760
I've got nothing.

31:52.840 --> 31:54.840
I'll be honest, Catherine,
I'm way out
of my comfort zone here.

31:59.200 --> 32:03.680
When I became Mayor,
I was terrified of speaking
in public.

32:03.760 --> 32:06.240
But I've realised there are only
two things to remember.

32:06.320 --> 32:07.680
And what are they?

32:07.760 --> 32:09.760
Number one, keep it short.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.520
-And number two?
-Keep it short.

32:11.600 --> 32:13.040
I can do short.

32:13.120 --> 32:15.120
How about I just say,
"Fair play to you, Commissioner.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.600
"You're a great fella,
here's your award."

32:17.320 --> 32:18.760
Mm-hmm.

Thank you.

33:15.720 --> 33:17.320
No problem.

33:20.760 --> 33:22.240
Ah, Florence, good morning.

33:22.320 --> 33:23.360
Morning, sir.

33:23.440 --> 33:25.080
-JP told me you were here.
-I am.

33:25.160 --> 33:28.000
Was that Archie Martindale
you were talking to?

33:28.080 --> 33:29.560
It was indeed. Do you know him?

33:29.640 --> 33:32.320
Everyone knows Archie.
He's a legend on the island.

33:32.400 --> 33:34.600
He must be, what, 83 now?

33:34.680 --> 33:35.920
Eighty-four.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.840
And he's still driving
the ambulance. It's amazing.

33:37.920 --> 33:39.840
So, what were you
talking to him about?

33:39.920 --> 33:41.840
Oh, yeah. Sit down,
I'll explain.

33:41.920 --> 33:44.560
Sorry, monsieur.
Two more coffees, please.

33:44.640 --> 33:46.640
Right, so last night

33:46.720 --> 33:48.520
I came across these.

33:48.600 --> 33:51.040
Letters to Cressida,
all unopened.

33:51.120 --> 33:53.040
Daniel must have been
keeping them from her.

33:53.120 --> 33:54.320
Their from her parents.

33:57.800 --> 34:00.040
From what I can glean,
Daniel insisted

34:00.120 --> 34:02.880
that Cressida cut off
all communication
between friends and family

34:02.960 --> 34:04.360
after they got married
and moved out here.

34:04.440 --> 34:06.480
-Really?
-For all his zen-like calm,

34:06.560 --> 34:09.320
Daniel Friend, it seems,
was a very controlling man.

34:09.400 --> 34:11.040
I've come across people
like that before.

34:11.120 --> 34:13.000
I know how they operate.

34:13.080 --> 34:16.040
And then I remember
Dwayne saying
that the emergency services

34:16.120 --> 34:18.560
had been called to the retreat
just a couple of months ago.

34:18.640 --> 34:20.200
You think Daniel might have
hurt Cressida?

34:20.280 --> 34:22.000
It's just a hunch, that's all.

34:22.080 --> 34:24.240
But I chased the call, and, yes,

34:24.320 --> 34:26.080
the ambulance was called
to tend to injuries

34:26.160 --> 34:27.320
that Cressida had received.

34:27.400 --> 34:28.480
Thank you.

34:28.560 --> 34:30.480
Which is why you were
talking to Archie.

34:30.560 --> 34:31.880
Exactly.

34:31.960 --> 34:34.880
He says that Cressida
had treatment for a broken rib,

34:34.960 --> 34:36.960
and Daniel was with her.

34:37.040 --> 34:39.200
Did either of them say
what had happened?

34:39.280 --> 34:41.440
Yeah, they said
she fell off a ladder

34:41.520 --> 34:43.000
fixing something or other.

34:43.080 --> 34:44.720
But Archie had doubts.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.240
JACK: He was suspicious,

34:46.320 --> 34:48.920
said that Cressida
was tearful, on edge.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.480
But they both stuck
to the ladder story,

34:51.560 --> 34:53.200
nothing he could do about it.

34:53.280 --> 34:57.120
So, what, you think
maybe Cressida had
had enough and fought back?

34:57.200 --> 34:58.960
She's the one who killed Daniel?

34:59.040 --> 35:00.680
Well, only she can answer that.

(WAVES CRASHING)

35:21.000 --> 35:22.760

he used to swim every day.

35:23.600 --> 35:25.320
Lovely.

35:25.400 --> 35:28.520
We found these.
Daniel's personal effects.

35:28.600 --> 35:31.480
They're all addressed to you,
and most of them are unopened.

35:34.160 --> 35:36.440
Daniel was always threatened
by Mum and Dad.

35:36.520 --> 35:37.520
They were suspicious of him.

35:37.600 --> 35:39.320
Why was that?

35:39.400 --> 35:41.920
Because of the family trust,
they assumed that everyone
was on the make.

35:42.720 --> 35:45.400
-But Daniel wasn't?
-No.

35:45.480 --> 35:47.120
Daniel wasn't interested
in money.

35:47.200 --> 35:48.720
He rejected any kind
of materialism.

35:52.200 --> 35:54.280
The retreat, whose idea was it?

35:55.440 --> 35:56.520
Daniel's.

35:56.960 --> 35:58.520
Initially.

35:58.600 --> 36:00.280
But I didn't need
much convincing.

36:00.360 --> 36:02.120
And did he always get
what he wanted?

36:02.200 --> 36:04.440
Two months ago,
you were taken to hospital.

36:04.520 --> 36:06.200
A broken rib.

36:06.280 --> 36:07.280
What happened?

36:09.600 --> 36:12.160
It was an accident, that's all.
I fell off a step ladder.

36:12.240 --> 36:14.480
Are you absolutely sure
about that, Cressida?

36:15.840 --> 36:18.800
He's not here now.
He can't hurt you anymore.

36:22.120 --> 36:23.960
It was a row
that got out of hand.

36:24.040 --> 36:25.400
That's all.

36:25.480 --> 36:28.240
I wanted to go home to England
for my brother's wedding.

36:28.320 --> 36:29.840
Daniel didn't want me to go.

36:29.920 --> 36:32.760
-So he hurt you?
-Not on purpose.

36:32.840 --> 36:33.880
If you'd seen him afterwards,

36:33.960 --> 36:36.200
he was always
so contrite and loving.

36:36.280 --> 36:37.360
Always?

36:37.440 --> 36:39.480
So this happened more than once?

36:39.560 --> 36:41.240
You must have been
desperate to get away.

36:41.320 --> 36:43.360
To escape.

36:43.440 --> 36:46.440
I imagine you were prepared
to do anything.

36:46.520 --> 36:49.240
I could have walked away
if I wanted to.

36:49.320 --> 36:51.280
I didn't need to kill him
to escape our marriage,

36:51.360 --> 36:52.760
if that's what
you're insinuating.

36:54.160 --> 36:55.360
Hmm.

36:57.480 --> 37:00.160
Ah! Chief,
you're back just in time.

37:00.240 --> 37:01.680
-What have you got?
-You see,

37:01.760 --> 37:03.560
we couldn't find anything
on Daniel Friend

37:03.640 --> 37:05.600
that dated back
farther than three years.

37:05.680 --> 37:08.440
His tax affairs, bank records,
e-mail accounts,

37:08.520 --> 37:11.520
even his current passport
were issued three years ago.

37:11.600 --> 37:12.960
Go on.

37:13.040 --> 37:15.080
Now, me and JP are starting
to think that Daniel Friend

37:15.160 --> 37:17.600
isn't actually Daniel Friend.

37:17.680 --> 37:20.360
So who was Daniel Friend
before he was Daniel Friend?

37:20.440 --> 37:22.160
That's what we don't yet know.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.560
If he did change his name,
it wasn't done officially.

37:24.640 --> 37:28.480
So our victim
had a previous identity.

37:30.040 --> 37:32.600
I was on a fraud case once,
back when I first started.

37:32.680 --> 37:34.440
Months, we were
after this fella.

37:34.520 --> 37:36.640
He was so slippery,
we used to call him the eel.

37:36.720 --> 37:38.720
Kept reinventing himself.

37:38.800 --> 37:40.520
New identities, the lot.

37:40.600 --> 37:42.920
But finally,
he tripped himself up.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.680
You see, he had stashed
mementoes of his previous life

37:45.760 --> 37:46.760
under the floorboards.

37:46.840 --> 37:48.480
Couldn't quite let go,
I suppose.

37:48.560 --> 37:51.280
But we haven't found
anything like that
in Daniel's possessions.

37:51.360 --> 37:52.880
Hmm, not a whiff.

37:52.960 --> 37:55.640
Yeah, but when we found Daniel,
there was a key...

37:56.960 --> 37:58.200
Chief.

37:58.280 --> 37:59.480
For a cash box,

37:59.560 --> 38:00.560
which we haven't yet found.

38:00.640 --> 38:02.160
Now, what if this box

38:02.240 --> 38:04.800
contains the remnants
of his previous life?

38:07.520 --> 38:09.760
I think the answer lies
somewhere in the ground here.

38:09.840 --> 38:11.160
Dwayne, do your thing.

38:11.240 --> 38:14.480
Uh, Chief, there's quite a lot
to cover here, you know?

38:14.560 --> 38:16.920
Any specific place
you want me to start?

38:17.000 --> 38:18.320
Your guess is as good as mine.

38:20.480 --> 38:23.000
Maybe we try visualising
finding it.

38:23.080 --> 38:24.680
Just like you saw me do earlier.

38:24.760 --> 38:26.280
What if I'm not like you?

38:26.360 --> 38:28.120
What if I haven't got the gift?

38:28.200 --> 38:29.440
It's worth a try.

39:02.160 --> 39:03.520
Right, well.

39:03.600 --> 39:05.680
Let's see if this tells us

39:05.760 --> 39:07.760
just who Daniel Friend
really is.

39:17.880 --> 39:19.280
JACK: Hello, Michael Bennett.

39:23.280 --> 39:24.960
Yes, uh-huh.

39:25.040 --> 39:27.760
Unlike Daniel Friend,
Michael Bennett has a past.

39:27.840 --> 39:30.320
And a pretty colourful one, too,
by the looks of things.

39:30.400 --> 39:32.800
A string of failed businesses
investigated for embezzlement.

39:32.880 --> 39:34.080
Thank you very much.

39:34.160 --> 39:35.480
That was the airport.

39:35.560 --> 39:36.720
Now, there was a Michael Bennett

39:36.800 --> 39:38.160
booked on a flight
to South Africa

39:38.240 --> 39:39.600
the day Daniel died.

39:39.680 --> 39:41.160
So that's what he was up to.

39:41.240 --> 39:42.640
Why he was going
to dig up the box.

39:42.720 --> 39:43.960
He was making a break for it.

39:44.040 --> 39:46.960
So this cash must have been
his running-away fund.

39:47.040 --> 39:48.760
But what was he running
away from?

39:48.840 --> 39:50.920
Sir, take a look at this.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.480
Four years ago, Michael Bennett
was the co-owner

39:53.560 --> 39:55.880
of a homeopathic business
in Hertfordshire

39:55.960 --> 39:57.160
which went bust,

39:57.240 --> 39:59.920
leaving his partner
100,000 in debt.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.080
And why is that significant?

Oh, she said she cleared it
with you, Inspector.

40:25.320 --> 40:27.160
Did she now?
So where did she go?

40:27.240 --> 40:29.480
Oh, she took a taxi
to the harbour.

40:59.360 --> 41:01.240
Michael Bennett ripped you off.

41:01.320 --> 41:03.520
Left you £100,000 in debt,

41:03.600 --> 41:05.600
and then vanished off
the face of the earth.

41:05.680 --> 41:08.280
I'd say that gives you
a pretty good reason
to want revenge.

41:08.360 --> 41:10.120
Well, I didn't come here
to kill him.

41:10.200 --> 41:12.640
No? So why did you come here?

41:12.720 --> 41:15.520
Why, you just fancied a bit
of spiritual rejuvenation

41:15.600 --> 41:17.800
-and then by
sheer coincidence...
-No.

41:17.880 --> 41:20.720
I mean, there was one
coincidence involved.

41:20.800 --> 41:21.840
Which was?

41:21.920 --> 41:23.480
One day a friend of mine
called me

41:23.560 --> 41:27.280
and said she'd happened
upon this review
of the retreat online.

41:27.360 --> 41:28.720
And there was
a photo of Michael.

41:28.800 --> 41:30.320
Right, so you booked
yourself a place.

41:30.400 --> 41:31.960
What then? What was the plan?

41:32.040 --> 41:34.880
Well, I mean, to confront him.

41:34.960 --> 41:38.480
EVA: And demand an apology,
and what he owed me.

41:38.560 --> 41:41.760
He looked so shocked.
He couldn't believe
that I'd found him.

41:42.400 --> 41:43.520
Welcome.

41:44.320 --> 41:45.440
And what did he say?

41:45.520 --> 41:46.960
That he'd have the money
by the end of the week,

41:47.040 --> 41:50.000
but, um he begged me
not to mention it to Cressida.

41:50.080 --> 41:51.800
And you believed him.

41:51.880 --> 41:54.960
Even though
you'd been here before,
left high and dry.

41:55.040 --> 41:57.280
Well, I'm not sure
if I believed him,

41:57.360 --> 41:59.560
but I knew I wasn't gonna
leave here without my money.

41:59.640 --> 42:02.400
I'm sure you weren't,
but Daniel was.

42:02.480 --> 42:05.360
He had a flight booked
and a big load of cash.

42:05.440 --> 42:07.840
I think he was about to do
exactly what he'd done
to you before.

42:07.920 --> 42:09.280
His disappearing act.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.360
Leaving you
with only one option,

42:11.440 --> 42:14.040
if you couldn't get your money,
then you'd have to settle
for revenge.

42:19.840 --> 42:21.880
JACK: One man, two names.

42:21.960 --> 42:23.960
Daniel Friend
and Michael Bennett.

42:24.040 --> 42:26.800
Four suspects,
each of them with a motive.

42:26.880 --> 42:29.560
And yet, not one of them
had the opportunity

42:29.640 --> 42:31.680
to follow Daniel down that path

42:31.760 --> 42:33.200
and then strangle him.

42:33.280 --> 42:35.320
Because they were all sitting
together in a circle

42:35.400 --> 42:38.400
in the half hour between Daniel
being seen alive

42:38.480 --> 42:40.960
and being found dead.

42:41.040 --> 42:43.440
So just how on earth
did our killer manage to do it?

-JACK: Anyone?

42:46.120 --> 42:47.400
(DWAYNE SIGHS)

42:47.480 --> 42:48.720
It's impossible.

42:48.800 --> 42:50.800
Except, it can't be,
because it did happen.

42:50.880 --> 42:52.320
Sir, the time.

42:52.400 --> 42:54.640
Don't we need to get ready
for the award ceremony?

42:54.720 --> 42:56.840
Oh, it starts
in less than an hour
and I've still got no speech.

42:56.920 --> 42:58.400
What am I gonna do?

42:58.480 --> 43:00.760
If we put together everything
we know about the commissioner,

43:00.840 --> 43:02.360
I'm sure we can come up
with something.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.600
So, what have we got?

43:06.680 --> 43:08.720
JP: Okay, so, um...

43:08.800 --> 43:12.680
Yes, we know that
the commissioner
was born on the island.

43:12.760 --> 43:14.040
-Mm-hmm.
-JP: So, um...

43:15.080 --> 43:16.760
Yes, anyone else?

43:16.840 --> 43:19.120
-Well, he...
-Um...

43:19.200 --> 43:20.640
He is...

43:20.720 --> 43:22.280
The commissioner. Let's think.

The Lifetime Award for Services
to the Island.

44:02.480 --> 44:05.000
And here to present the award

44:05.080 --> 44:08.440
is Detective Inspector
Jack Mooney.

44:08.920 --> 44:10.160
God help me.

44:21.520 --> 44:24.440
What can you say about
Commissioner Selwyn Patterson?

44:26.520 --> 44:28.280
(MICROPHONE FEEDBACK)

44:32.280 --> 44:35.360
Selwyn Patterson was born
here in Saint Marie

44:36.000 --> 44:37.200
and as you all know,

44:37.280 --> 44:39.560
he's been our commissioner
for quite a while now.

44:39.640 --> 44:42.040
And even if some of you
aren't certain

44:42.120 --> 44:44.120
of what a commissioner
actually does,

44:44.200 --> 44:46.520
well, I'm sure
you'll all agree that

44:46.600 --> 44:48.440
he seems to know
exactly what he's doing.

44:48.520 --> 44:49.680
(CHUCKLES)

44:50.840 --> 44:52.440
(COUGHING IN AUDIENCE)

44:57.560 --> 45:01.440
Hand on heart,
I don't really know
the commissioner that well.

45:01.520 --> 45:03.800
I mean, I've only been
on the island
for less than a year.

45:04.840 --> 45:06.520
But I'd like to think

45:06.600 --> 45:08.600
even in that short time,

45:08.680 --> 45:11.120
I've got to know something
about the people of Saint Marie.

45:11.200 --> 45:13.360
People like the team
I work with,

45:13.440 --> 45:14.920
who'll come around
to keep you company

45:15.000 --> 45:18.080
when your daughter flies off
to the other side of the world.

45:18.160 --> 45:21.040
Or bring dinner to the office
when you've been working
too hard.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.080
In short,

45:24.160 --> 45:26.920
the people of this island
are among the most friendly,

45:27.000 --> 45:28.200
decent, good-hearted people

45:28.280 --> 45:30.000
I've ever had the pleasure
to meet.

45:30.080 --> 45:31.880
And if you've decided

45:31.960 --> 45:35.280
that Selwyn Patterson
deserves this award,

45:35.360 --> 45:37.480
well, then he must be
a very fine man, indeed.

45:38.640 --> 45:39.840
Congratulations, Commissioner.

45:54.640 --> 45:56.240
Well said, sir.

45:56.320 --> 45:57.560
It's typical, isn't it?

45:57.640 --> 45:59.200
I mean, you can spend days
trying to plan something

45:59.280 --> 46:00.960
or you can make
something up on the spot,

46:01.040 --> 46:02.880
and the result is exactly
the same.

46:02.960 --> 46:05.400
Thank you, DI Mooney,

46:05.480 --> 46:08.840
for those kind
and well-chosen words.

46:08.920 --> 46:10.280
Make something up on the spot.

46:10.360 --> 46:11.520
Sir?

46:11.600 --> 46:12.920
What if that's what
the killer did?

46:13.000 --> 46:15.080
Because Daniel wasn't where
he was supposed to be.

46:19.320 --> 46:21.640
Closing our eyes...

46:23.280 --> 46:24.880
And then Gabe went
to get his phone,

we called your lot.

is DI Mooney solving a case.

urgent matters to attend to.

That's exactly it.

the wrong way around.

47:05.840 --> 47:07.360
Dwayne, call the undertaker.

47:07.440 --> 47:08.840
We need to get Daniel's
body back.

47:08.920 --> 47:10.160
And wake up the pathologist.

47:10.240 --> 47:11.640
We need him to run
one more test.

can eat a sandwich

47:31.520 --> 47:33.080

to take a selfie of it.

Yet, these little fellas
are strictly verboten

here at the Calming Breath.

47:37.760 --> 47:38.960
Why?

47:39.040 --> 47:42.520
Well, Daniel claims
it was for holistic reasons.

47:42.600 --> 47:44.120
But that wasn't the case.

47:44.200 --> 47:47.400
His obsession with privacy
wasn't for his guests' benefit.

47:47.480 --> 47:48.760
It was for his own benefit.

47:48.840 --> 47:50.960
Because truth is,
Daniel was terrified

47:51.040 --> 47:53.520
of being exposed
for who he really was.

47:54.160 --> 47:55.480
Michael Bennett.

47:55.560 --> 47:56.840
Who?

47:56.920 --> 47:59.160
But Daniel wasn't the only liar
here at the retreat.

47:59.240 --> 48:00.800
You've all got your secrets.

48:00.880 --> 48:02.920
But only one of you
has been lying

48:03.000 --> 48:05.600
to cover up the fact
that you're a murderer.

48:07.320 --> 48:08.840
Now, all of you sitting there

48:08.920 --> 48:11.040
are confident that you've got
the perfect alibi.

48:11.880 --> 48:13.360
And truth be told,

48:13.440 --> 48:15.640
the question that's been
eating away at me
for the last few days

48:15.720 --> 48:18.400
is how on earth did our killer
manage to strangle Daniel

48:18.480 --> 48:19.720
while sitting
in a meditation circle.

48:19.800 --> 48:22.760
But you don't still think
it was one of us, do you?

48:22.840 --> 48:24.120
Oh, more than ever.

48:24.200 --> 48:26.800
As a matter of fact,
I know for certain it was.

48:26.880 --> 48:27.920
We now know the real reason

48:28.000 --> 48:31.280
why Daniel didn't go
for a swim that day

48:31.360 --> 48:34.240
was because he was on his way
to retrieve this

48:34.320 --> 48:35.760
from where he'd buried it.

48:35.840 --> 48:38.360
It contained the few remnants
of Daniel's former life.

48:38.440 --> 48:41.640
Michael Bennett's passport,
his birth certificate,

48:41.720 --> 48:44.440
and a significant
amount of cash.

48:44.520 --> 48:46.160
An escape fund, if you will.

48:46.240 --> 48:47.440
Now that his cover
had been blown

48:47.520 --> 48:49.400
by the woman he used
to own a business with,

48:49.480 --> 48:51.480
he knew it was high time
to scarper.

48:51.560 --> 48:54.200
He had his flights
to South Africa
booked and ready.

48:54.280 --> 48:57.040
But Daniel would never make it
as far as Johannesburg.

48:57.120 --> 48:59.280
He wouldn't even make it
as far as the cash box.

48:59.360 --> 49:01.880
Because while he was
on his way to get that,

49:01.960 --> 49:05.240
he collapsed
and fell down in the dirt.

49:06.120 --> 49:07.480
Unconscious.

49:09.080 --> 49:10.680
Unconscious? Why?

49:10.760 --> 49:12.040
Because he'd been drugged.

49:12.120 --> 49:14.680
Drugged? You said
he'd been strangled.

49:14.760 --> 49:16.760
Oh, Daniel
was strangled all right.

49:16.840 --> 49:18.000
That's for sure.

49:18.080 --> 49:20.960
But that wasn't the way
he was meant to die, no.

49:21.040 --> 49:23.800
He was supposed to drown,
wasn't he?

49:26.320 --> 49:27.280
Gabe?

49:29.480 --> 49:31.280
Me? You can't be serious!

49:31.360 --> 49:33.720
Yeah. We went back
to the pathologist

49:33.800 --> 49:37.160
and we asked him to run
an additional test
on Daniel's body.

49:37.240 --> 49:40.040
And that showed
that around 65 milligrams

49:40.120 --> 49:42.480
of a strong,
fast acting sedative

49:42.560 --> 49:43.760
was in his system.

49:43.840 --> 49:44.920
I remember Cressida saying...

49:45.840 --> 49:47.320
It was about half past 2:00.

49:47.400 --> 49:50.120
We'd just finished lunch.

49:50.200 --> 49:53.280
I'm guessing that's how
you got the sedative
into Daniel's system.

49:53.360 --> 49:54.320
In his green tea.

49:57.920 --> 50:00.520
You knew what time Daniel went
for his swim every day.

50:00.600 --> 50:01.880
Half past 2:00.

50:01.960 --> 50:04.880
Enjoy your swim, my love.

50:04.960 --> 50:07.720
JACK: It was only
a few minutes' walk
from here to the beach.

50:07.800 --> 50:09.680
And you knew what time
lunch was served.

50:09.760 --> 50:12.480
So it wasn't very difficult
to work out what kind
of a dose to give him.

50:14.760 --> 50:16.720
Especially as you're
a trained doctor.

50:16.800 --> 50:20.000
Just enough to kick in
as he was swimming out
into the ocean,

50:20.080 --> 50:22.360
causing him to fall
into a deep sleep
and drown.

50:22.440 --> 50:23.720
Best case scenario,

50:23.800 --> 50:25.920
his body would be lost
to the ocean, never to return.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.400
Worst case,

50:27.480 --> 50:30.440
cause of death
would be dismissed
as a tragic accident.

50:30.520 --> 50:31.960
Meaning, no one
would bother to ask

50:32.040 --> 50:33.920
for a blood analysis
of the victim.

50:34.000 --> 50:35.640
No. Not any more than they would

50:35.720 --> 50:38.200
if the cause of death
was strangulation.

50:38.280 --> 50:42.160
Unlucky for you, Daniel decided
not to go for a swim that day.

50:42.240 --> 50:45.520
Instead, he headed
for the Contemplation Garden.

50:45.600 --> 50:49.120
No wonder finding him
lying on the path
knocked you sideways.

50:49.200 --> 50:50.880
That was the last thing
you were expecting.

50:50.960 --> 50:52.960
And worst of all,
he was still alive.

50:53.040 --> 50:54.800
He was still alive?

50:54.880 --> 50:56.760
JACK: In that moment,

50:56.840 --> 50:58.880
you realised
you needed to improvise.

50:58.960 --> 51:01.080
So thinking on your feet,
you made a bold decision.

51:01.160 --> 51:02.160
You told Cressida...

51:03.320 --> 51:04.280
He's dead.

51:05.920 --> 51:07.640
(CRYING)

51:09.840 --> 51:11.880
While Eva was comforting you,

51:11.960 --> 51:13.320
Gabe offered to go
and get his phone

51:13.400 --> 51:15.400
so he could call the police,

51:15.480 --> 51:17.520
knowing that this would
give him enough time

51:17.600 --> 51:19.600
to get back to Daniel
and finish the job.

51:20.520 --> 51:22.480
So, Gabe ran

51:23.200 --> 51:25.040
and grabbed his phone.

51:25.120 --> 51:27.360
And then he headed back
to Daniel's body.

51:28.760 --> 51:32.160
And then, so as he wouldn't
leave any fingerprints,

51:32.240 --> 51:34.240
he used the only weapon
that he had on him.

51:35.880 --> 51:37.840
The belt from around his robe.

51:44.080 --> 51:45.720
And he strangled Daniel.

51:51.800 --> 51:53.480
There was no struggle.

51:53.560 --> 51:55.320
How could there be?

51:55.400 --> 51:57.320
The man was unconscious.

51:57.400 --> 51:59.000
And utterly defenceless.

52:01.120 --> 52:03.040
And that left only
one more thing for you to do

52:03.120 --> 52:05.080
before returning to the others.

52:05.160 --> 52:06.640
Dispose of the belt.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.160
So where did you hide it?

52:13.680 --> 52:16.480
No? Dwayne, JP, if you would.

52:20.360 --> 52:23.720
On the morning
of Daniel's death,
Cressida here

52:23.800 --> 52:26.200
held an art therapy session
with Bryn and with Gabe.

52:27.720 --> 52:30.920
It was only a few hours later
that Daniel was killed.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.080
The clay would have
still been wet.

52:38.400 --> 52:39.560
Oh.

52:39.640 --> 52:40.640
(BOTH GASP)

52:42.720 --> 52:45.040
FLORENCE: Once you had hidden
the incriminating belt

52:45.120 --> 52:46.760
with Daniel's DNA on it,

52:46.840 --> 52:49.120
you then took a clean belt
from the storeroom

52:50.920 --> 52:52.760
and tied it around
your own robe.

52:54.040 --> 52:55.560
Why?

52:55.640 --> 52:57.320
What did Daniel ever do to you?

52:57.400 --> 53:00.720
It wasn't about what Daniel
did to Gabe, was it?

53:00.800 --> 53:02.320
It was what he did
to Gabe's sister.

53:03.480 --> 53:05.440
GABE: He really
messed her around.

53:05.520 --> 53:07.040
She kept telling me
she was fine.

53:08.280 --> 53:09.920
But she wasn't.

53:10.000 --> 53:11.960
The man you married, Cressida,

53:12.040 --> 53:14.600
was once in a relationship
with Ruth Lee.

53:15.800 --> 53:17.640
But she knew him
as Michael Bennett.

53:17.720 --> 53:19.600
Now, as far as I can tell,
Michael Bennett,

53:19.680 --> 53:22.440
he only ever achieved
real success at one thing,

53:22.520 --> 53:23.840
screwing over women.

53:24.360 --> 53:26.320
(SIGHS)

53:32.600 --> 53:35.840
Ruth was totally in love
with Michael.

53:37.360 --> 53:39.520
And then he just vanished.

53:39.600 --> 53:42.440
Took her savings,
her car, and...

53:42.520 --> 53:43.840
broke her heart so badly,

53:43.920 --> 53:46.280
she never came back from it.

53:46.360 --> 53:50.200
Daniel Friend spent a lifetime
running away

53:50.280 --> 53:53.120
from his debt,
from responsibility.

53:53.840 --> 53:55.480
From himself.

53:55.560 --> 53:59.000
But like I said, in an age where
our every move is recorded,

53:59.840 --> 54:01.720
no one can outrun their past.

54:01.800 --> 54:04.000
Of course, the irony here is

54:04.080 --> 54:06.360
that if Daniel hadn't been
trying to run away,

54:06.440 --> 54:08.000
on this occasion,

54:08.080 --> 54:09.840
there was every chance
that his killer

54:09.920 --> 54:11.760
would have got away with murder.

54:11.840 --> 54:14.320
You know when he saw me,
he didn't even recognise me.

54:14.400 --> 54:17.320
That's how little my sister
meant to him.

54:17.400 --> 54:20.520
I don't regret what I did.
He deserved it.

54:20.600 --> 54:22.920
At least now,
Ruth can rest in peace.

54:24.640 --> 54:25.600
JP.

54:27.880 --> 54:29.280
JP: Okay, up you get.

54:36.320 --> 54:38.360
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

54:43.000 --> 54:47.160
Well, I can't deny
what my eyes saw, JP.

54:47.240 --> 54:49.720
This book really does
have magic in it.

54:50.800 --> 54:52.360
For instance,

54:52.440 --> 54:56.600
right now Catherine
is going to bring us
both over a free beer.

54:56.680 --> 54:57.880
And how did you come to that?

54:57.960 --> 54:59.600
Well, how do you think, man?

54:59.680 --> 55:01.200
I visualised it.

55:01.280 --> 55:02.560
Remember?

55:03.480 --> 55:04.760
Here you are, gentlemen.

55:04.840 --> 55:06.160
(CHUCKLES)

55:06.240 --> 55:07.720
Two beers.

55:07.800 --> 55:09.880
You see? Cheers.

55:09.960 --> 55:10.960
CATHERINE: Oh.

55:12.040 --> 55:13.400
And your bill, Dwayne.

55:13.480 --> 55:15.200
Oh. (CHUCKLES)

55:15.280 --> 55:18.640
But, Catherine,
how come this says 10 beers?

55:18.720 --> 55:21.920
The last time you were in,
you forgot to pay.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
But you don't mind
settling up now, do you?

55:24.080 --> 55:25.720
Oh, no, but...

55:25.800 --> 55:27.240
-Later?
-Hmm.

55:27.960 --> 55:29.240
(LAUGHS)

55:33.160 --> 55:34.560
-Like I said...
-Hmm.

55:34.640 --> 55:36.200
...it's all a big con.

55:40.960 --> 55:43.080
You sure you're all right
to finish off here, sir?

55:43.160 --> 55:44.800
Yeah, you go on ahead.

55:44.880 --> 55:46.680
-See you in the morning.
-Night, sir.

55:49.840 --> 55:50.840
DS Cassell.

55:52.680 --> 55:53.920
Commissioner.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.960
It might not have been
quite the speech
I was hoping for,

56:03.040 --> 56:05.320
but in its own peculiar way,

56:05.400 --> 56:07.440
I appreciated the sentiment.

56:07.520 --> 56:09.400
Well, it was from the heart.

56:09.480 --> 56:11.280
I gathered.

56:11.360 --> 56:15.040
I was pleased to note
how well you are settling
into island life.

56:15.120 --> 56:17.760
Saint Marie has clearly
got under your skin.

56:17.840 --> 56:19.040
Has indeed, sir.

56:26.440 --> 56:27.440
Cricket.

56:28.400 --> 56:29.440
Sorry?

56:29.520 --> 56:31.280
Watching my father play cricket.

56:31.360 --> 56:33.960
You wanted to know
what was my earliest memory.

56:34.040 --> 56:35.600
-Just for the record.
-Right.

56:37.040 --> 56:38.800
It's too bad I couldn't
put that in my speech.

56:39.520 --> 56:42.080
Who knows? Maybe in time,

56:42.160 --> 56:44.080
we might get to know each other
a little better.

56:44.160 --> 56:45.800
I'd like that.

56:45.880 --> 56:48.200
Perhaps we could go
for another drink.

56:48.280 --> 56:50.760
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves, Inspector.

57:12.800 --> 57:14.440
Police, please!

57:16.280 --> 57:17.440
Cordell Thomas?

57:17.520 --> 57:19.800
Now, why would our victim
be clutching a peanut?

57:19.880 --> 57:23.160
I didn't do it, Inspector.

57:23.240 --> 57:26.360
You have hot-footed it up here
to stuff your face,

57:26.440 --> 57:28.880
while the rest
of your poor colleagues
are working through the night.

57:28.960 --> 57:30.480
But it's my birthday!

57:30.560 --> 57:32.400
JACK: First girl I ever kissed
had the same initials.

57:32.480 --> 57:34.360
Leonie Brennan.
Terrifying she was.

57:34.440 --> 57:35.600
God, I hope it's not her.

57:35.680 --> 57:37.640
