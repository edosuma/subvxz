WEBVTT

00:05.436 --> 00:06.636
Hey, Lauren!

00:06.638 --> 00:09.206
Think fast!

00:09.208 --> 00:10.641
- Yeah, she's playing for the team.
- Mmhmm.

00:10.643 --> 00:11.842
Actually, I'm into dudes again.

00:11.844 --> 00:13.379
Women are just too much work.

00:13.381 --> 00:15.381
No, we're talking about
the 16-inch softball team.

00:15.383 --> 00:17.818
- What's 16-inch softball?
- It's basically

00:17.820 --> 00:19.220
regular softball's fat sister...

00:19.222 --> 00:21.522
same pretty face,
just bigger and easier.

00:21.524 --> 00:23.057
Oh, right, the big rivalry

00:23.059 --> 00:24.493
between creatives
and account execs.

00:24.495 --> 00:25.660
Yeah. I started reading

00:25.662 --> 00:27.061
about that in the
company newsletter,

00:27.063 --> 00:28.296
and then I stopped
when I realized

00:28.298 --> 00:30.132
I was reading the
company newsletter.

00:30.134 --> 00:31.233
You know I write that.

00:31.235 --> 00:33.369
That is such a cute top.

00:33.371 --> 00:34.203
Morning, Muggles.

00:34.205 --> 00:35.439
Simon, are you playing?

00:35.441 --> 00:36.707
No. Please. I'm retired.

00:36.709 --> 00:38.411
Besides, softball is
a young lesbian's game.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.381
And I'm neither
of those anymore.

00:40.383 --> 00:41.917
Last time Simon played
was ten years ago

00:41.919 --> 00:44.289
when he single-handedly won
the game for the Creatives.

00:44.291 --> 00:45.458
God, I would have given

00:45.460 --> 00:46.493
anything to have seen that.

00:46.495 --> 00:47.728
Anything.
Me, too.

00:47.730 --> 00:49.764
Oh. That's why you should
read the newsletter.

00:49.766 --> 00:53.235
Because every year,
I reprint the story.

00:53.237 --> 00:54.670
That seems like
lazy journalism.

00:54.672 --> 00:55.938
Look at you
in your sleevelessssop

00:55.940 --> 00:57.706
and short shorts.
It was my first game.

00:57.708 --> 00:59.909
I didn't know what to wear,
so I went Richard Simmons.

00:59.911 --> 01:01.177
Simon's kind of a legend.

01:01.179 --> 01:02.278
They say it was one

01:02.280 --> 01:03.613
of the greatest sports moments
of all time.

01:03.615 --> 01:05.282
Please, no need to
rehash my glory days.

01:05.284 --> 01:07.418
Besides, we have to work on
the Rice Krispies campaign.

01:07.420 --> 01:09.388
Yeah. We have a lot of
work to do, people.

01:09.390 --> 01:10.989
Let's focus up, guys.

01:10.991 --> 01:12.692
It was a late fall evening.

01:13.794 --> 01:16.330
The last of the fireflies
were winking in the night.

01:16.332 --> 01:18.632
The air was crisp
with a hint of warm brown sugar.

01:18.634 --> 01:20.968
We had just landed
the Bath & Body Works account.

01:20.970 --> 01:23.070
And Simon Roberts
steps up to bat

01:23.072 --> 01:24.705
and, boom, hits
four home runs...

01:24.707 --> 01:26.373
Bitch, it was five.

01:26.375 --> 01:28.343
If you're going to tell
the story, tell it right.

01:28.345 --> 01:29.444
This is is how it happened.

01:29.446 --> 01:31.446
It all came down
to the final play.

01:31.448 --> 01:33.549
I was at home plate,
bases were loaded.

01:33.551 --> 01:34.917
And there on the mound

01:34.919 --> 01:36.953
was my nemesis,
my business partner,

01:36.955 --> 01:40.591
Gordon Lewis, glaring at me
like a Yeti on crack.

01:40.593 --> 01:42.592
You're goin' down, Roberts.

01:42.594 --> 01:43.760
It's a good impression.

01:43.762 --> 01:45.595
- Thank you.
- And that's when I did...

01:45.597 --> 01:47.965
the point, a little move
I borrowed from Babe Ruth.

01:47.967 --> 01:49.066
- The point...
- Sorry.

01:49.068 --> 01:50.334
...halfway
between the sky

01:50.336 --> 01:52.770
and Gordon's
Easter Island face.

01:52.772 --> 01:54.205
And then, time changed.

01:54.207 --> 01:55.807
It was like
everything went into...

01:55.809 --> 01:57.041
slow motion.

01:57.043 --> 01:58.977
And the fateful pitch

01:58.979 --> 02:00.178
came at me.

02:00.981 --> 02:04.317
Sydney, the fateful pitch
came at me.

02:05.520 --> 02:07.486
- Ah...
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

02:07.488 --> 02:09.920
And I hammered it. Ah!

02:11.056 --> 02:13.624
It went it up, up, up.

02:13.626 --> 02:15.492
And a little more up. Yeah!

02:15.494 --> 02:16.726
Straight over

02:16.728 --> 02:18.828
the center field fence,
exactly where I pointed!

02:18.830 --> 02:20.829
And the crowd went wild!

02:22.766 --> 02:24.231
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

02:24.233 --> 02:25.465
Give me! Give me! Give me!

02:25.467 --> 02:27.033
Oh, yeah!
Yeah!

02:27.035 --> 02:30.102
And I'll never forget the look
on Gordon's fafa when he said,

02:30.104 --> 02:32.204
Simon Roberts, you...

02:32.206 --> 02:34.338
Lucky son of a bitch.

02:35.475 --> 02:37.741
Um....could we have
our ball back?

02:37.743 --> 02:39.443
It's mine now, kid.

02:39.445 --> 02:41.278
Fun's over.

02:41.280 --> 02:43.913

02:43.915 --> 02:46.781

02:58.293 --> 03:01.260
I don't know. Do you think Snap
and Crackle are too far apart?

03:01.262 --> 03:03.462
Yeah, but Pop wants it that way.

03:03.464 --> 03:06.130
See, he's secretly in love
with Snap, and though

03:06.132 --> 03:08.699
he appreciates Crackle's ideas,
Pop's ready to move on.

03:08.701 --> 03:13.938
Just he and Snap
starting over somewhere fresh.

03:13.940 --> 03:17.441
I stayed late last night,
and thoughts came to me.

03:17.443 --> 03:19.177
Gordon Lewis
is bringing baked goods!

03:19.179 --> 03:21.020
I call the ladies' room.
Every man for himself.

03:28.789 --> 03:30.689
What's the big deal?

03:30.691 --> 03:32.391
It's just some
rosemary shortbread

03:32.393 --> 03:34.058
that my husband made.

03:34.060 --> 03:37.927
Butter, sugar, suppressed rage
for a directionless life.

03:37.929 --> 03:40.930
Which is also the name of
his play that went nowhere.

03:40.932 --> 03:42.531
We see you with baked goods,

03:42.533 --> 03:44.800
we think you're going
to fire someone.

03:44.802 --> 03:46.001
Well, in that case...

03:46.003 --> 03:47.802
you're right.

03:48.938 --> 03:50.337
How did we lose
the Pocket Motorcycle account?

03:50.339 --> 03:51.605
We didn't lose 'em.

03:51.607 --> 03:52.806
We dumped them.

03:52.808 --> 03:54.674
Apparently, they overestimated
the weight limit,

03:54.676 --> 03:57.577
and a... a bunch
of fat kids got hurt.

03:57.579 --> 04:00.379
Dad, I'm sorry. I know how much
that account meant to you.

04:00.381 --> 04:02.548
Aah!
Whoa!

04:02.550 --> 04:04.249
Kids are going to love this!

04:04.251 --> 04:05.683
Well, I know childhood obesity
is a problem,

04:05.685 --> 04:07.451
but why take it away
from the thin kids?

04:07.453 --> 04:08.618
They did nothing wrong.

04:08.620 --> 04:09.719
Look, you know the deal.

04:09.721 --> 04:11.020
We get an account,
we hire people.

04:11.022 --> 04:12.955
We lose an account,
we got to lay someone off.

04:12.957 --> 04:14.289
Well, we'll be sorry
to lose you, Gordon.

04:14.291 --> 04:15.523
But look at the positive side.

04:15.525 --> 04:17.089
You and Timothy can spend
more time together.

04:17.091 --> 04:18.257
Maybe open a little
dinner theatre,

04:18.260 --> 04:19.860
a B and B.

04:19.862 --> 04:21.761
I'm told it's a middle-aged
gay man's world out there.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.663
Yeah, everything's
coming up Gordon.

04:23.665 --> 04:25.132
Mm. All right, listen.

04:25.134 --> 04:26.333
This is what we have to do.

04:26.335 --> 04:27.568
We're gonna have to lose

04:27.570 --> 04:29.203
one of your little baby birds
on the creative side.

04:29.205 --> 04:30.371
Why does it have
to be our side?

04:30.373 --> 04:31.906
Why can't we just lose someone
in accounts?

04:31.908 --> 04:33.875
Accounts lost someone
in the last three layoffs.

04:33.877 --> 04:34.976
It's creative's turn.

04:34.978 --> 04:36.377
Absolutely not!
We're not losing anyone.

04:36.379 --> 04:37.511
They're like family.

04:37.513 --> 04:38.879
Brad, Asian Brad,
even Lazy Tony.

04:38.881 --> 04:40.147
It's Tim, and he's not lazy.

04:40.149 --> 04:41.381
He's in a wheelchair.

04:41.383 --> 04:42.749
They're like my children.

04:42.751 --> 04:44.283
Well, I'm not laying off
one of Gordon's Guerrillas.

04:44.285 --> 04:45.451
Then we're at an impasse.

04:45.453 --> 04:47.219
Okay, there's only one thing
to do.

04:47.221 --> 04:48.921
Softball bet.

04:48.923 --> 04:50.589
- Wait. A bet?
- Mmhmm.

04:50.591 --> 04:51.858
That's right.
That's how we resolve

04:51.860 --> 04:54.027
all of our major dilemmas.

04:54.029 --> 04:56.662
Why do you think the urinals
are now a foot higher?

04:56.664 --> 04:57.663
Okay, so that settles it then.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.298
Whoever loses the softball game

04:59.300 --> 05:01.767
is gonna has to fire someone
from their department.

05:01.769 --> 05:04.303
- Done.
- And be warned.

05:04.305 --> 05:05.871
I have the best team yet.

05:05.873 --> 05:08.407
Account Execs are going
to destroy you, Roberts.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.342
Destroy you!

05:10.344 --> 05:12.845
In your dreams, Lewis.
In your dreams.

05:20.848 --> 05:23.281
I just feel like
there's more to the story

05:23.283 --> 05:24.950
of Snap, Crackle and Pop.

05:24.952 --> 05:27.318
Where are you, lost lady?

05:27.320 --> 05:29.921
I hate this.
I don't want to fire anyone.

05:31.224 --> 05:32.523
Nancy. Hey, sweetie.

05:32.525 --> 05:34.492
Tell her I say hi.

05:34.494 --> 05:35.793
Yeah, lunch sounds great.

05:35.795 --> 05:37.929
I'll just do a search for
a vegetarian restaurant

05:37.931 --> 05:40.599
within a three-miles radius
that doesn't smell like B.O.

05:40.601 --> 05:42.067
Okay, I got to go. Byesies.

05:43.304 --> 05:44.870
Why didn't you tell her
I say hi?

05:44.872 --> 05:47.640
Uh, she prefers the more formal,
"Good Day."

05:47.642 --> 05:49.208
It reminds her of a simpler time

05:49.210 --> 05:50.943
when people arrived
on time for dinner

05:50.945 --> 05:52.712
and left
before balling the help.

05:52.714 --> 05:53.880
- And you're lying.
- Yeah.

05:53.882 --> 05:56.049
- I am. She hates you.
- Wait.

05:56.051 --> 05:57.984
- Well, why would she hate me?
- Come on.

05:57.986 --> 06:00.086
- What do you care? You hate her.
- That's not the point!

06:00.088 --> 06:02.455
You and I are friends.
If she doesn't like me...

06:02.457 --> 06:03.623
It's because of the kiss.

06:03.625 --> 06:04.791
That? That was nothing!

06:04.793 --> 06:07.461
So, you had a crush on me
for, like, two seconds.

06:07.463 --> 06:10.030
And why would you ever tell her
that you kissed me?

06:10.032 --> 06:12.766
Well, I said there was a kiss,
that lips met lips.

06:12.768 --> 06:14.634
Whose lips lunged first,
I cannot say.

06:14.636 --> 06:15.835
But you did.

06:15.837 --> 06:17.170
I did. Yours lunged first.

06:17.172 --> 06:19.472
Damn it, Andrew! You lied?

06:19.474 --> 06:21.408
It was just easier
to explain that way!

06:21.410 --> 06:22.676
And I couldn't not tell her.

06:22.678 --> 06:25.311
Even if it was a lie,
I had to be honest with her.

06:25.313 --> 06:26.479
I don't like this.

06:26.481 --> 06:27.947
Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

06:27.949 --> 06:31.684
her jealousy makes the sex
crazy good.

06:31.686 --> 06:33.820
That is so good to hear.

06:35.256 --> 06:37.657
All right, we have to optimize
our chances for a win.

06:37.659 --> 06:39.659
First thing we have
to do is assign positions.

06:39.661 --> 06:40.994
Okay?

06:40.996 --> 06:43.663
What the hell is that?
Oh.

06:43.665 --> 06:46.199
Andrew wanted
to introduce a female character

06:46.201 --> 06:48.301
to Snap, Crackle and Pop.

06:48.303 --> 06:50.836
You know, three bachelors
living alone in a cereal bowl.

06:50.838 --> 06:52.404
You know, people talk.

06:52.406 --> 06:56.009
It's brilliant, but I don't
have time for brilliance.

06:56.011 --> 06:58.145
He has another one of those,
right?

06:58.147 --> 06:59.814
Yeah.
Okay, good.

06:59.816 --> 07:02.283
All right, who do we have?

07:02.285 --> 07:03.518
- Um, me.
- Okay.

07:03.520 --> 07:04.519
- Uh, Andrew.
- Nah.

07:04.521 --> 07:05.686
- Sydney.
- Yeah.

07:05.688 --> 07:08.022
And, uh, someone who wrote,
"Fire Tommy.

07:08.024 --> 07:09.890
He had sex on your desk."

07:09.892 --> 07:11.825
What happened?
We had ten people this morning.

07:11.827 --> 07:13.260
People keep crossing their names
off the list.

07:13.262 --> 07:14.727
I guess it's too much pressure
to know

07:14.729 --> 07:16.395
if you screw up,
someone loses their job.

07:16.397 --> 07:18.732
No, this is the time we should
be rallying together as a team.

07:18.734 --> 07:20.467
You know what would make
people play?

07:20.469 --> 07:22.303
- What? - If you signed up.
- No, no, no.

07:22.305 --> 07:24.672
- I don't play anymore. - No, but
it would give everyone hope.

07:24.674 --> 07:26.607
They need to believe
they have a chance to win.

07:26.609 --> 07:28.909
- They need a hero. - Oh,
I'm-l'm really not a hero.

07:28.911 --> 07:31.912
Come on, hero.

07:32.981 --> 07:35.583
Sorry. Really wasn't
expecting that.

07:35.585 --> 07:37.484
Oh, no. You know, it's
okay, though. There.

07:37.486 --> 07:38.719
There you go.
I'm ready now.

07:38.721 --> 07:39.953
- Okay.
- Let's do this. Yeah!

07:39.955 --> 07:42.789
Come again.

07:43.525 --> 07:44.892
Oh.

07:44.894 --> 07:46.326
Oh, is there a glare?

07:46.328 --> 07:50.297
Simon? Tell me more about Flizz.
She seems like a nice girl.

07:50.299 --> 07:52.432
How can I lie to that face?
You're like a baby who shaves.

07:52.434 --> 07:54.902
Okay, I can't play softball.

07:56.238 --> 07:58.772
You hit five home runs
in one game.

07:58.774 --> 08:00.107
You ever hear the story
of Dock Ellis?

08:00.109 --> 08:02.376
I feel like you're about
to tell me an old-timey story.

08:02.378 --> 08:04.444
He was a Major League pitcher
who threw a no-hitter.

08:04.446 --> 08:07.047
He later admitted that he did it
while tripping on acid.

08:07.049 --> 08:08.214
Imagine walking out

08:08.216 --> 08:10.116
onto a field,
and the field is like...

08:11.787 --> 08:15.222
30,000 disembodied hands are,
"I'm coming for you!"

08:15.224 --> 08:16.890
And then, this nice penguin
hands you a ball.

08:16.892 --> 08:18.425
All the pigeons
overhead starting

08:18.427 --> 08:20.327
to turn into vultures.

08:20.329 --> 08:23.097
I wonder what
they're talking about in there.

08:23.099 --> 08:25.766
Maybe they're admiring my
new Rice Krispies character,

08:25.768 --> 08:26.967
Flizz.

08:26.969 --> 08:29.370
I unknowingly took a
play out of his book.

08:29.372 --> 08:31.538
I was high as a kite. I remember
looking down at the field,

08:31.540 --> 08:33.474
going, "Well, I look
pretty good, huh?"

08:33.476 --> 08:34.674
I haven't played since.

08:34.677 --> 08:36.611
Wow.
Yeah.

08:36.613 --> 08:38.113
I'm not athletic.

08:38.115 --> 08:39.813
I never was.

08:39.816 --> 08:42.383
I once was tangled in a
jump rope for an entire day.

08:42.385 --> 08:43.884
When they found me, they
put me on suicide watch.

08:43.885 --> 08:46.020
So this is just between
you and us, okay?

08:46.022 --> 08:47.888
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

08:47.890 --> 08:49.557
- And you know what?
- What?

08:49.559 --> 08:51.826
- I still think we can win.
- You do?

08:51.828 --> 08:53.160
100%.

08:53.162 --> 08:54.929
"Yes, ve gan." Like, "Yes,
we.."" That's clever.

08:54.931 --> 08:55.997
You see?
No, yeah, , get it.

08:55.999 --> 08:58.634
See, you say, "No
grande"" Nancy!

08:58.636 --> 09:00.002
Hey!
Oh, my God.

09:00.004 --> 09:01.670
Oh. I didn't know...

09:01.672 --> 09:04.173
...you were going to be here!

09:04.175 --> 09:05.308
Hi, Sydney.

09:05.310 --> 09:06.676
Yeah, Nancy's just
taking me out to lunch,

09:06.678 --> 09:07.877
so if you could just...

09:07.879 --> 09:08.845
...just move your body.

09:08.847 --> 09:10.613
Oh, you know, why don't I
just ride

09:10.615 --> 09:11.814
down with you guys.

09:11.816 --> 09:13.149
Oh, good.

09:15.052 --> 09:19.189
So, Nancy, um, I have
a gift for you, actually.

09:19.191 --> 09:20.123
It's a gift certificate

09:20.125 --> 09:21.391
to the Peninsula for a massage.

09:21.393 --> 09:22.659
It's a couples massage.

09:23.796 --> 09:24.929
Well, which is it?

09:24.931 --> 09:27.165
Which is what?
You said

09:27.167 --> 09:28.666
you didn't know I
was going to be here,

09:28.668 --> 09:29.901
but you had a gift for me.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.671
So, you must have known
I was going to be here.

09:32.673 --> 09:34.706
Which is it?

09:34.708 --> 09:36.374
Your hair is so perfect.

09:36.376 --> 09:38.075
It's like a wig!

09:38.077 --> 09:40.944
Thanks.

09:40.946 --> 09:43.847
Attention, Creatives!

09:43.849 --> 09:45.815
I know t tse are fragile times.

09:45.817 --> 09:47.350
I know you're scared.

09:47.352 --> 09:48.818
And I know Tommy
had sex on my desk,

09:48.820 --> 09:51.321
but still, I'm asking you
to fight for your team!

09:51.323 --> 09:54.325
Are we going to let
Accounts take our jobs?

09:54.327 --> 09:55.827
No, we're not!

09:55.829 --> 09:56.961
What do we want?!

09:56.963 --> 09:59.430
A new microwave! One
with a popcorn button!

09:59.432 --> 10:02.199
That'd be great, but we still
need a victory on that field!

10:02.201 --> 10:05.068
So I'm asking you to trust
me and sign this list!

10:05.070 --> 10:06.403
Step up and say,

10:06.405 --> 10:10.240
"I will play!
I will play."

10:10.242 --> 10:11.709
Dad, you're playing?
Oh, my God, he's playing?

10:11.711 --> 10:12.676
Yes.
Simon!

10:12.678 --> 10:13.878
Simon! Simon!

10:13.879 --> 10:15.412
No! No! No! No!
No! No! No! No!

10:15.414 --> 10:16.547
No! No! No!

10:16.549 --> 10:18.782
Simon! Simon!

10:18.784 --> 10:20.084
We could always fire Tommy!

10:20.086 --> 10:22.386
None of our desks are safe! No!

10:22.388 --> 10:24.088
- Simon! Simon!
- No!

10:24.090 --> 10:26.190
- Simon! Simon! Simon!
- No!

10:30.630 --> 10:32.063
Okay, so, at one point,

10:32.065 --> 10:34.566
you hit a ball over
a fence five times.

10:34.568 --> 10:36.468
- I was a little enhanced.
- Your body

10:36.470 --> 10:38.436
- should be able to do it again.
- Yeah.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.671
We just need to remind it how.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.239
Good, good, maybe I can
lead the team to victory.

10:41.241 --> 10:42.640
I just have to
warn you, though,

10:42.642 --> 10:44.976
I have a bad back, a trick
ankle, and a questionable mole.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.712
All helpful information.

10:46.714 --> 10:47.780

11:17.344 --> 11:18.877
- Be honest with me.
- Honest?

11:18.879 --> 11:20.044
- Yeah.
- Okay.

11:20.046 --> 11:22.646
Well, you lack
flexibility, coordination,

11:22.648 --> 11:24.782
and have no real comprehension
of the game itself.

11:24.784 --> 11:27.351
- Plus your pants give you
a diaper butt. - Okay,

11:27.353 --> 11:29.120
now be a little less honest,
remember you work for me.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.221
- You're a natural.
- And the pants?

11:30.223 --> 11:31.823
- So cute.
- Okay, so I've got

11:31.825 --> 11:33.859
72 hours to be the best
softball player of all time

11:33.861 --> 11:35.927
so someone doesn't get fired.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.162
- No pressure.
- Boss,

11:37.164 --> 11:38.696
you're psyching yourself out.

11:38.698 --> 11:39.898
Maybe just let go of your ego.

11:39.899 --> 11:40.865
Ego?

11:40.867 --> 11:42.066
I don't have an ego.

11:42.068 --> 11:43.001
No, God,

11:43.003 --> 11:44.068
- who said that.
- I don't know.

11:44.070 --> 11:45.103
- Ego.
- Haha.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.673
- You know what?
- What?

11:48.675 --> 11:50.541
Maybe we're thinking
about this the wrong way.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.943
Really? As long as they believe

11:51.945 --> 11:53.911
that they're playing the legend

11:53.913 --> 11:55.279
and not the creaky tin man

11:55.281 --> 11:56.380
standing before me...

11:56.382 --> 11:57.448
- your words...
- My words?

11:57.450 --> 11:58.750
...then we have a chance.

11:58.752 --> 12:00.118
- You think so?
- Yeah.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.586
- I'm a legend. - You
are a legend, baby.

12:02.588 --> 12:04.255
You're gonna psych Accounts out

12:04.257 --> 12:05.322
just by walking on that field.

12:05.324 --> 12:06.557
You'll have Gordon shaking

12:06.559 --> 12:08.192
in his size 20 Top-Siders.

12:08.194 --> 12:10.260
We're going to crush you,
Roberts.

12:10.262 --> 12:12.062
In your dreams, Gordon.
I've waited for this rematch

12:12.064 --> 12:13.764
for ten years.

12:13.766 --> 12:15.866
It's kind of like when
Carol Channing went

12:15.868 --> 12:19.136
up against Pearl Bailey with
those dueling Hello, Dollys.

12:19.138 --> 12:20.303
Oh, yeah,

12:20.305 --> 12:22.239
I could have used
a sports reference,

12:22.241 --> 12:23.474
but I chose not to.

12:23.476 --> 12:26.144
He seems more confident

12:26.146 --> 12:27.111
than you suggested.

12:27.113 --> 12:28.279
You know what they say:

12:28.281 --> 12:29.347
frightened people
are the loudest.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.583
Ha, they say that?!

12:31.585 --> 12:34.185
Okay, team,
this is our chance to win.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.687
The only thing we have
to remember to do is to focus...

12:36.689 --> 12:38.423
Nancy, hi!

12:38.425 --> 12:40.324
Oh, I'm so glad
you could make it.

12:40.326 --> 12:42.093
That bag is fabulous...
Nancy, is it Tory Burch?

12:42.095 --> 12:43.060
- I almost bought one just...
- Sydney.

12:43.062 --> 12:44.595
focus.
Focus.

12:44.597 --> 12:45.795
With Simon on our team,

12:45.797 --> 12:46.963
we cannot lose... that's my dad.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.644
I enjoy being a legend.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.417
Is it selfish I want to
make this all about me?

15:53.419 --> 15:54.551
That's the very definition
of selfish.

15:54.553 --> 15:56.019
How do I make this about
me and not be selfish?

15:56.021 --> 15:58.855
Just go out there and try your best.
Uhhuh.

15:58.857 --> 16:00.724
And if it helps,
still look up to you.

16:00.726 --> 16:01.992
- Really?
- And really

16:01.994 --> 16:03.727
is there an opinion out here
more important than mine?

16:03.729 --> 16:06.397
- Well, there's my daughter. - You don't
have to say it... I know I'm number one.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.165
For God's sakes,
get a room already.

16:09.168 --> 16:11.435
All right, all right.

16:12.571 --> 16:14.405
Ow!

16:14.407 --> 16:16.207
Dad.

16:16.209 --> 16:17.809
Are you faking that?

16:17.811 --> 16:18.810
Of course he's not.

16:18.812 --> 16:19.811
Are you, boss?

16:19.813 --> 16:20.879
Wish I was.

16:20.881 --> 16:22.447
Dad, are you okay?
That looked like it hurt.

16:22.449 --> 16:24.682
I'm fine, I just don't want to
disappoint everybody, you know.

16:24.684 --> 16:25.983
Disappoint everybody? This
team has never played better

16:25.985 --> 16:27.918
- because of you.
- He's right.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.587
All right,
look, let's get him to a bench.

16:29.589 --> 16:30.588
There you go.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.056
Get up here, Simon.

16:32.058 --> 16:34.559
Oh, gosh, you know,
the last time we did this,

16:34.561 --> 16:35.893
you were passed out naked

16:35.895 --> 16:38.429
except for an egregious amount
of Mardi Gras beads.

16:38.431 --> 16:41.566
Boy, was I relieved to
find out it was Mardi Gras.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.067
Hey, Sydney,

16:43.069 --> 16:44.035
is your dad okay?

16:44.037 --> 16:45.704
Oh, yeah, he's
going to be fine.

16:45.706 --> 16:46.805
Thank you for asking.

16:46.807 --> 16:47.973
I'm glad,

16:47.975 --> 16:50.574
and by the way, thank you
again for that spa thing.

16:50.576 --> 16:54.911
I got a foot fungus, but
the massage was not horrible.

16:54.913 --> 16:56.012
Welcome.
Maybe

16:56.014 --> 16:58.048
after the game we can grab
something to eat?

16:58.050 --> 16:59.450
I would love that.

16:59.452 --> 17:01.185
You know, I eat anything...

17:01.187 --> 17:02.887
ice cream, pizza,

17:02.889 --> 17:05.089
- bacon double cheeseburgers
between two donuts. - Yeah.

17:05.090 --> 17:06.656
Hey, did you see that?

17:06.659 --> 17:09.527
You mean your slow descent
into type-two diabetes? Yes.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.929
Sydney, you cannot be
friends with my girlfriend.

17:11.931 --> 17:12.863
I forbid it.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.131
- Why?
- Because

17:14.133 --> 17:17.502
you and I... it got weird
between us for a second,

17:17.503 --> 17:19.337
and now seeing you next to her,

17:19.339 --> 17:23.209
it's just confusing for me.

17:23.211 --> 17:24.242
Get a hit.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.743
Come on, I thought

17:25.746 --> 17:27.713
we left the drama at home.

17:29.115 --> 17:30.649
Play ball.

17:32.252 --> 17:34.419
- Whoo!
- Wh... oh, ow.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.026
I'm starting to think
we shouldn't play sports

17:41.028 --> 17:42.260
at work anymore.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.261
You're going to be okay, honey,

17:43.263 --> 17:44.463
just a little yellow concealer.

17:44.465 --> 17:45.697
Oh, my God,

17:45.699 --> 17:46.999
- Nancy, I am so sorry.
- You're a monster.

17:47.001 --> 17:48.234
Hey, hey.

17:48.236 --> 17:50.069
I tried to be friends with
you in spite of the fact

17:50.071 --> 17:52.105
that you went
after my boyfriend.

17:52.107 --> 17:53.941
No, I didn't, I...

17:57.044 --> 18:00.246
If I can't have him,
no woman can.

18:04.218 --> 18:06.219
Hey!

18:06.221 --> 18:07.353
Who's gonna bat?

18:07.355 --> 18:09.322
So I can strike 'em out
and get this over with.

18:09.324 --> 18:10.723
I'll bat.

18:10.725 --> 18:11.824
Dad, that's a broom.

18:11.826 --> 18:12.959
I'll broom.

18:12.961 --> 18:15.829
Is, is he okay?

18:15.831 --> 18:17.531
I got this, baby, I'm back in.

18:17.533 --> 18:21.168
He might be a little loopy
from the muscle relaxer.

18:21.170 --> 18:22.969
I gave him a shot.

18:22.971 --> 18:25.004
Wait, you gave him a shot?

18:57.607 --> 18:58.606
Why is he running?

18:58.608 --> 19:00.074
He didn't hit the ball.

19:04.813 --> 19:06.780
'Cause he's a legend.

19:45.620 --> 19:47.888
That's gonna leave a mark.

19:47.890 --> 19:49.824
Come on, Lazy Tony,
come on, Lazy Tony.

19:49.826 --> 19:51.859
Okay, let's see,
what do we got here?

19:51.861 --> 19:52.894
Andrew... no.

19:52.896 --> 19:54.696
Okay, come on, Lazy Tony.

19:54.698 --> 19:55.964
It's Tim,
and we can't fire him.

19:55.966 --> 19:57.465
I know, I can't find
his name anywhere.

19:57.467 --> 19:58.867
This is not the way to do this.

19:58.869 --> 20:00.035
Look, let me save you
the trouble,

20:00.037 --> 20:01.803
and it galls me to say this,

20:01.805 --> 20:04.072
but yesterday doesn't count.

20:04.074 --> 20:05.173
You were high.

20:05.175 --> 20:07.108
How can anybody hit
a ball like that?

20:07.110 --> 20:08.242
I have no idea.

20:08.244 --> 20:09.977
Well, then, how are
we going to decide?

20:09.979 --> 20:11.145
Well, we're professionals

20:11.147 --> 20:14.215
and we'll decide this
like professionals.

20:14.217 --> 20:17.951
Pocket motorcycle jousting!

20:19.655 --> 20:21.389
On your marks,

20:21.391 --> 20:25.005
get set, go!

20:25.020 --> 20:28.529

20:28.531 --> 20:30.064
Oh, no.

20:33.588 --> 20:38.657
Step right up... hit the
boom, make a sound...

20:39.358 --> 20:41.926
- Hey, Lauren, think fast.
- Great.

20:43.995 --> 20:46.395
No, wait, wait,
there's another option.

20:46.397 --> 20:47.996
Hold on, go back,
I blew the line.

20:47.998 --> 20:50.264
Go back, go back.

20:53.535 --> 20:55.935
Give me the knockers.
