WEBVTT

01:01.813 --> 01:06.401
I'M THE WIDOW SANDERSON,
AND THESE ARE MY CHILDREN:

01:06.568 --> 01:11.781
JOHN JR., CARL, AND ALICIA.

01:11.948 --> 01:14.951
I'LL MAKE THIS
AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE.

01:16.703 --> 01:18.830
IT'S REALLY VERY SIMPLE.

01:18.997 --> 01:24.210
I--WELL, I ALWAYS FELT
I WAS TOO ORNERY TO DIE,

01:24.377 --> 01:26.463
BUT IT SEEMS I WAS WRONG.

01:26.629 --> 01:29.007
GOD MUST HAVE FOUND
SOME GOOD IN ME

01:29.174 --> 01:30.592
'CAUSE HE'S CALLING ME EARLY.

01:30.759 --> 01:35.346
MY YOUNG'UNS HERE
WILL NEED A NEW HOME.

01:35.513 --> 01:37.390
YOU MADE ME
A PROMISE

01:37.557 --> 01:38.892
THE OTHER DAY,
CHARLES.

01:39.058 --> 01:40.685
REMEMBER?

01:40.852 --> 01:43.313
I REMEMBER.

01:44.355 --> 01:46.149
GRACE WILL TAKE CARE
OF THE CHILDREN

01:46.316 --> 01:48.943
TILL YOU MAKE
YOUR DECISION.

01:51.070 --> 01:57.243
JULIA SANDERSON ASKED ME
TO READ THIS TODAY.

01:57.410 --> 02:00.580
SHE WROTE IT TO ALL OF YOU,
LOVED ONES AND FRIENDS ALIKE.

02:04.250 --> 02:08.338
"REMEMBER ME WITH
SMILES AND LAUGHTER...

02:08.505 --> 02:12.258
"FOR THAT'S THE WAY
I'LL REMEMBER YOU ALL.

02:12.425 --> 02:14.928
"IF YOU CAN ONLY REMEMBER ME

02:15.094 --> 02:16.596
"WITH TEARS,

02:16.763 --> 02:18.973
THEN DON'T REMEMBER ME AT ALL."

02:49.462 --> 02:50.880
GOOD DAY TO YOU,
MR. INGALLS.

02:51.047 --> 02:52.340
MR. ANDERS, MA'AM.

02:52.507 --> 02:54.259
I KNOW THIS ISN'T
THE PLACE,

02:54.425 --> 02:56.177
BUT WE WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU...

02:56.344 --> 02:58.304
ABOUT THE CHILDREN.

02:58.471 --> 02:59.556
CERTAINLY.

02:59.722 --> 03:01.224
WE'RE JUST HEADING OVER
TO THE SANDERSON PLACE

03:01.391 --> 03:02.809
TO MAKE SURE THE CHILDREN
ARE ALL RIGHT.

03:02.976 --> 03:04.394
WE COULD FOLLOW
YOU OVER.

03:04.561 --> 03:07.605
I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER
IF WE TALKED AT OUR PLACE.

03:07.772 --> 03:10.149
WHATEVER YOU THINK.

03:10.316 --> 03:12.402
WE'LL SPEND A LITTLE TIME
WITH GRACE AND THE CHILDREN,

03:12.569 --> 03:13.820
THEN HEAD ON HOME.

03:13.987 --> 03:15.655
HOW ABOUT AFTER
SUPPER, ABOUT 8:00?

03:15.822 --> 03:17.490
8:00 WOULD BE FINE.

03:17.657 --> 03:19.242
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

03:23.913 --> 03:25.665
[BLOWS]

03:25.832 --> 03:28.334
THERE WE GO. YOU
HAVE A GOOD SLEEP.

03:28.501 --> 03:29.377
Laura: PA?

03:29.544 --> 03:30.837
MM-HMM?

03:31.004 --> 03:32.964
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO
DO ABOUT THE LAST PUPPY.

03:33.131 --> 03:34.257
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

03:34.424 --> 03:36.050
WELL, NELLIE HEARD ABOUT
HIM, AND SHE WANTS HIM.

03:36.217 --> 03:37.886
SHE ONLY WANTS HIM
'CAUSE SHE KNOWS

03:38.052 --> 03:39.804
WE DON'T WANT HER
TO HAVE HIM.

03:39.971 --> 03:41.180
AH, I SEE.

03:41.347 --> 03:42.807
TROUBLE IS...

03:42.974 --> 03:44.475
NOBODY ELSE
IN SCHOOL CAN HAVE HIM.

03:44.642 --> 03:48.980
A COUPLE OF KIDS WANTED
HIM, BUT THEIR PA SAID NO.

03:49.147 --> 03:50.690
HE'S GOT TO HAVE
A HOME,

03:50.857 --> 03:53.610
BUT THE ONLY
ONE'S NELLIE'S.

03:53.776 --> 03:55.695
WELL, WHY DON'T WE JUST
WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS?

03:55.862 --> 03:57.655
SOMEBODY MIGHT CHANGE
THEIR MIND.

03:57.822 --> 03:59.782
IN THE MEANTIME,
THE PUP'S HAPPY WITH JACK.

03:59.949 --> 04:02.994
YOU MEAN, HE COULD STAY WITH
US A LITTLE WHILE LONGER?

04:03.161 --> 04:04.495
AS LONG AS IT TAKES.

04:04.662 --> 04:05.747
IT WOULDN'T BE RIGHT TO SEND
THAT PUP OFF TO SOME HOME

04:05.914 --> 04:06.998
HE WOULDN'T HE HAPPY IN.

04:07.165 --> 04:08.041
THANKS, PA.

04:08.207 --> 04:09.834
THANKS, PA.

04:10.001 --> 04:11.210
SEE YOU
IN THE MORNING.

04:11.377 --> 04:12.211
GOOD NIGHT.

04:12.378 --> 04:13.713
GOOD NIGHT, PA.

04:19.260 --> 04:20.720
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

04:20.887 --> 04:22.972
I'LL GET IT.
MUST BE THE ANDERS.

04:24.849 --> 04:26.726
PLEASE COME IN.

04:28.394 --> 04:29.812
CAROLINE JUST MADE
SOME COFFEE.

04:29.979 --> 04:31.314
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME?

04:31.481 --> 04:32.690
I WOULD. IT'S A DAMP
NIGHT. THANK YOU.

04:32.857 --> 04:33.858
NONE FOR ME.

04:34.025 --> 04:35.068
PLEASE, SIT DOWN.

04:35.234 --> 04:36.194
CAN I TAKE
YOUR WRAP?

04:36.361 --> 04:37.737
I THINK I'LL
JUST LEAVE IT ON

04:37.904 --> 04:39.572
TILL I WARM UP
A BIT. THANK YOU.

04:39.739 --> 04:41.407
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME COOKIES?

04:41.574 --> 04:42.659
THEY'RE OATMEAL.

04:42.825 --> 04:43.826
NO, THANK YOU.

04:43.993 --> 04:45.203
Charles:
THEY'RE GOOD.

04:45.370 --> 04:46.955
NONE FOR ME,
THANK YOU.

04:51.459 --> 04:53.169
WELL, YOU WANTED
TO TALK

04:53.336 --> 04:54.754
ABOUT THE SANDERSON
CHILDREN.

04:54.921 --> 04:57.173
YES. I'LL COME
RIGHT TO THE POINT.

04:57.340 --> 04:58.758
I KNOW YOU'VE HAD
A LONG DAY.

04:58.925 --> 05:00.426
SYLVIA AND I HAVE
BEEN TALKING IT OVER,

05:00.593 --> 05:05.098
AND WE'D LIKE TO OFFER
A HOME TO THE BOYS.

05:05.264 --> 05:06.891
TO THE BOYS.

05:07.058 --> 05:08.393
WHY, YES, I'VE GOT

05:08.559 --> 05:10.520
A FAIR-SIZED PLACE,
AS YOU KNOW, AND...

05:10.687 --> 05:12.438
MY WIFE AND I
HAVE NEVER HAD

05:12.605 --> 05:13.898
ANY CHILDREN OF OUR OWN.

05:14.065 --> 05:16.484
WE CAN GIVE
THE BOYS A GOOD HOME.

05:19.237 --> 05:20.947
WELL, YOU KEEP SAYING
"THE BOYS."

05:21.114 --> 05:22.907
YOU HAVEN'T SAID
ANYTHING ABOUT ALICIA.

05:23.074 --> 05:25.618
WELL, TAKING
ON THE RESPONSIBILITY

05:25.785 --> 05:28.079
FOR THE 2 BOYS IS
ALL WE CAN HANDLE.

05:28.246 --> 05:32.792
THEY'RE BOTH OF WORKING AGE.
THEY CAN DO THEIR SHARE.

05:32.959 --> 05:34.627
IT WOULD BE MORE
THAN A BODY COULD MANAGE

05:34.794 --> 05:36.879
TO TAKE ON
ALL THE YOUNG'UNS.

05:40.925 --> 05:42.301
WELL, I UNDERSTAND
YOUR FEELINGS

05:42.468 --> 05:44.262
ABOUT THIS, MR. ANDERS.

05:46.472 --> 05:47.724
BUT WE HAVE TO THINK

05:47.890 --> 05:49.642
OF THE CHILDREN'S
FEELINGS, TOO.

05:50.935 --> 05:53.062
I JUST DON'T THINK
WE COULD SEPARATE THEM.

05:53.229 --> 05:55.231
ALL THEY HAVE IS EACH OTHER.

05:56.899 --> 05:58.401
WELL, I THINK YOU OUGHT

05:58.568 --> 06:00.570
TO THINK MORE ON
THE PRACTICAL, MR. INGALLS.

06:00.737 --> 06:02.196
IT AIN'T GONNA BE EASY

06:02.363 --> 06:04.824
FINDING FOLKS
TO TAKE ON 3 YOUNG'UNS.

06:04.991 --> 06:06.993
WELL, IT'S NOT GOING
TO BE EASY,

06:07.160 --> 06:08.953
BUT WE'RE
GONNA HAVE TO TRY.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.705
I SEE.

06:10.872 --> 06:12.790
IT ISN'T THAT WE DON'T
WANT THE LITTLE GIRL,

06:12.957 --> 06:13.875
MR. INGALLS.

06:14.042 --> 06:15.293
AS A MATTER
OF FACT, I WOULD--

06:15.460 --> 06:16.753
SYLVIA'.

06:16.919 --> 06:20.339
MR. INGALLS HAS MADE
HIS POSITION QUITE CLEAR.

06:20.506 --> 06:23.176
WE WON'T TAKE UP
ANY MORE OF YOUR TIME.

06:23.342 --> 06:24.343
I'LL SEE YOU OUT.

06:24.510 --> 06:26.220
THANK YOU FOR
THE COFFEE, MA'AM.

06:28.056 --> 06:28.890
GOOD NIGHT.

06:29.057 --> 06:30.266
GOOD NIGHT.

06:36.439 --> 06:37.440
I DON'T KNOW

06:37.607 --> 06:39.317
HOW HE COULD SUGGEST
SUCH A THING.

06:41.152 --> 06:44.739
WELL, I DON'T THINK
HE MEANT TO BE UNKIND.

06:44.906 --> 06:46.574
IF HE CAN JUST SEE
HIS WAY CLEAR INTO TAKING

06:46.741 --> 06:47.784
THE BOYS, I GUESS.

06:47.950 --> 06:49.535
TO WORK THE FARM.

06:49.702 --> 06:52.246
HE WANTS FARMHANDS,
NOT CHILDREN.

06:53.873 --> 06:55.249
WELL, MAYBE.

06:56.709 --> 06:58.002
YOU KNOW,

06:58.169 --> 07:00.338
IT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE
REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

07:00.505 --> 07:01.881
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY

07:02.048 --> 07:03.216
TO FIND A PLACE
FOR THOSE CHILDREN.

07:03.382 --> 07:08.179
DON'T BE DISCOURAGED.
WE HAVE TIME.

07:08.346 --> 07:10.515
THE CHILDREN ARE
WELL TAKEN CARE OF.

07:11.891 --> 07:13.226
YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:13.392 --> 07:15.478
IT'S JUST GOING TO TAKE
SOME TIME, THAT'S ALL.

07:18.606 --> 07:20.358
I'M GOING TO BED.
YOU COMING?

07:20.525 --> 07:22.527
YEAH, I'M JUST GOING
TO FINISH MY COFFEE.

07:22.693 --> 07:24.320
I'LL BE ALONG.

07:28.199 --> 07:29.033
GOOD NIGHT.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.284
GOOD NIGHT.

07:55.143 --> 07:56.435
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

07:56.602 --> 07:58.187
SHE FINALLY
WENT TO SLEEP.

07:58.354 --> 08:00.356
HOW ABOUT
JOHN AND CARL?

08:00.523 --> 08:01.566
THEY WERE ASLEEP

08:01.732 --> 08:03.317
BEFORE THEIR HEADS
HIT THE PILLOW.

08:03.484 --> 08:05.278
I DON'T THINK
THEY'VE SLEPT A WINK

08:05.444 --> 08:07.280
IN THE LAST 3 DAYS.

08:10.032 --> 08:11.951
OHH.

08:12.118 --> 08:13.953
WELL, I DON'T THINK

08:14.120 --> 08:15.788
I'M EVER GOING TO GET RID
OF THE CHILL ON THESE HANDS.

08:17.081 --> 08:19.959
IT'S LIKE THAT WHEN
YOU LOSE SOMEBODY.

08:20.126 --> 08:23.045
FEEL LIKE YOU'LL
NEVER SLEEP AGAIN.

08:23.212 --> 08:25.006
SOMETHING ABOUT
A BURYING

08:25.173 --> 08:26.632
THAT PUTS
AN END TO IT,

08:26.799 --> 08:28.551
AND ALL THAT TIRED
CATCHES UP.

08:31.387 --> 08:34.307
THEY REMIND ME
SO MUCH OF JULIA.

08:34.473 --> 08:38.978
THAT JOHN JR.
DID YOU SEE HIM TODAY?

08:39.145 --> 08:40.646
HE STOOD
BESIDE CARL AND ALICIA

08:40.813 --> 08:44.442
JUST AS STRAIGHT
AND STRONG AS A TREE...

08:44.609 --> 08:46.819
SO MUCH LIKE HER.

08:46.986 --> 08:48.070
YEAH.

08:49.822 --> 08:51.157
WELL, I BEST BE
ON MY WAY.

08:51.324 --> 08:52.617
I'LL STOP BY
TOMORROW

08:52.783 --> 08:54.493
TO SEE IF
YOU NEED ANYTHING.

08:56.162 --> 08:58.164
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE ASLEEP.

08:58.331 --> 09:00.082
I WAS.

09:00.249 --> 09:01.792
DO YOU WANT
SOME MILK?

09:03.628 --> 09:05.129
WELL, IS THERE
SOMETHING WRONG?

09:05.296 --> 09:08.132
MY PUPPY WET IN MY BED.

09:08.299 --> 09:09.383
OHH.
[EDWARDS LAUGHS]

09:09.550 --> 09:10.676
WELL, DON'T YOU WORRY
NONE ABOUT THAT.

09:10.843 --> 09:12.303
WE'LL FIX THAT UP
IN NO TIME AT ALL.

09:12.470 --> 09:14.096
I'LL GET A SHEET.

09:19.393 --> 09:21.145
YOU'RE NOT MAD
AT HIM, ARE YOU?

09:21.312 --> 09:23.189
OH, WHY, NO. THAT PUP--
THAT'S JUST A BABY.

09:23.356 --> 09:25.066
WHY, HE'LL LEARN
IN NO TIME AT ALL.

09:25.233 --> 09:27.026
HERE. I'LL DO THAT.
NOW, YOU COME ON.

09:27.193 --> 09:29.612
WE'LL FIX THAT BED
OF YOURS JUST RIGHT UP.

09:31.614 --> 09:33.783
[HUMMING]

09:40.706 --> 09:42.667

09:42.833 --> 09:44.335
ALL RIGHT. YOU JUST
SCRUNCH IN THERE.

09:44.502 --> 09:46.045
GET DOWN
UNDER THEM COVERS.

09:46.212 --> 09:48.047
THERE YOU GO.
WATCH THE PUP.

09:50.591 --> 09:53.052
THERE YOU ARE.

09:53.219 --> 09:55.721
SAY, YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

09:55.888 --> 09:57.223
SINCE THAT PUP OF
YOURS IS

09:57.390 --> 09:58.557
STILL A BABY LIKE,
YOU KNOW,

09:58.724 --> 10:00.017
MAYBE WE OUGHT TO
GET HIM A BED SO HE

10:00.184 --> 10:01.686
CAN SLEEP RIGHT HERE
NEXT TO YOU, JUST TILL

10:01.852 --> 10:03.312
HE'S HOUSEBROKE,
YOU UNDERSTAND.

10:03.479 --> 10:05.064
WHERE WOULD
WE GET A BED?

10:05.231 --> 10:07.066
I COULD BUILD ONE
TOMORROW.

10:07.233 --> 10:09.735
CAN'T HE JUST SLEEP
WITH ME JUST FOR TONIGHT

10:09.902 --> 10:11.737
UNTIL YOU MAKE UP
HIS BED?

10:11.904 --> 10:14.240
WELL, I DON'T
SEE WHY NOT.

10:14.407 --> 10:16.075
THANK YOU.

10:20.413 --> 10:22.915
YOU WANT TO GO
TO SLEEP NOW?

10:23.082 --> 10:23.791

10:23.958 --> 10:26.252
WELL, THEN CLOSE UP
THEM EYES.

10:26.419 --> 10:27.586

10:51.360 --> 10:52.737
WELL...

10:54.155 --> 10:55.531
THEY'RE BOTH ASLEEP.

10:56.615 --> 10:59.285
YOU DIDN'T LEAVE THE
PUP IN BED WITH HER?

10:59.452 --> 11:01.245
OH, JUST FOR TONIGHT.

11:01.412 --> 11:02.496
BY THE WAY, I'M GONNA
SLEEP IN THE BARN TONIGHT.

11:02.663 --> 11:04.165
I GOT TO BUILD
A BED TOMORROW.

11:04.332 --> 11:05.750
SEE YOU AT BREAKFAST.

11:05.916 --> 11:06.751
ALL RIGHT.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.420
HMM?

11:11.714 --> 11:13.215
ARE YOU GONNA DO
THE WASHING, TOO?

11:13.382 --> 11:17.178
HMM? OH. FORGOT ABOUT
THAT. WELL, GOOD NIGHT.

11:17.345 --> 11:19.638
[CHUCKLING]
GOOD NIGHT.

11:20.973 --> 11:23.476
[ISAIAH SINGING INDISTINCTLY]

11:33.152 --> 11:34.362

11:36.697 --> 11:38.324
SORRY I'M LATE. TOOK
A LITTLE LONGER

11:38.491 --> 11:39.992
AT THE NELSONS'
THAN I FIGURED.

11:40.159 --> 11:41.243
Carrie: I'M GONNA
PLAY DOLLY.

11:41.410 --> 11:44.288
YEAH, SO YOUR MA
TOLD ME.

11:44.455 --> 11:45.831
WELL, HOW DID IT GO?

11:45.998 --> 11:46.999
IT DIDN'T.

11:47.166 --> 11:48.584
THEY LIKED THE CHILDREN
WELL ENOUGH,

11:48.751 --> 11:50.002
BUT AFTER TALKING
IT OVER,

11:50.169 --> 11:51.170
THEY DECIDED
THEY'D WAIT,

11:51.337 --> 11:53.214
SEE IF THEY COULD HAVE
ONE OF THEIR OWN.

11:53.381 --> 11:57.259
THAT'S A SHAME.
THEY'RE SUCH A NICE COUPLE.

11:57.426 --> 11:59.720
YEAH, JUST ABOUT
THE LAST COUPLE.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.347
FOUR WEEKS, AND WE'RE
NO CLOSER TO FINDING A HOME

12:01.514 --> 12:02.848
FOR THOSE CHILDREN THAN WE
WERE WHEN WE STARTED.

12:03.015 --> 12:05.101
YOU WILL. DON'T
BE DISCOURAGED.

12:05.267 --> 12:09.021

23:24.154 --> 23:26.073
THE SOUND OF A LOVED
ONE SLEEPING...

23:28.450 --> 23:29.993
ALL RIGHT.
YOU MADE YOUR CHOICE.

23:30.160 --> 23:33.038
JUST DON'T EXPECT ME
TO TELL YOU IT'S RIGHT.

23:35.999 --> 23:38.460
AND DON'T EXPECT ME
TO TELL YOU YOU'RE RIGHT.

23:41.296 --> 23:43.882
YOU MADE YOUR CHOICE.
YOU WANT TO BE ALONE.

24:08.406 --> 24:09.741
THANK YOU, MR. INGALLS,

24:09.908 --> 24:11.952

I WOULD LIKE
TO ADOPT ALICIA.

24:23.296 --> 24:24.256
I PROMISED HARRIET

24:24.422 --> 24:26.258
I'D SPEND THANKSGIVING
WITH THEM.

24:26.424 --> 24:29.136
ALICIA AND I COULD
LEAVE THE NEXT DAY.

24:31.096 --> 24:34.808
I THINK IT WOULD BE WISE
IF I TOOK THE CHILD

24:34.975 --> 24:37.394
AFTER CHURCH SERVICES
ON THURSDAY.

24:37.561 --> 24:39.229
THAT WAY SHE COULD
SPEND AN EVENING WITH ME

24:39.396 --> 24:41.523
BEFORE THE TRIP BACK.

24:44.192 --> 24:46.403
WE WOULD HAVE
A LITTLE MORE TIME

EACH OTHER.

WHAT DO YOU THINK?

24:57.289 --> 24:59.332
ALL RIGHT.

THE ARRANGEMENTS, THEN?

26:54.364 --> 26:56.283
COME ON, ALICIA.

27:28.106 --> 27:31.568
YOU KNOW, I MADE
A PROMISE TO YOUR MA.

27:31.735 --> 27:35.697
I PROMISED HER
I'D FIND A HOME FOR YOU...

27:35.864 --> 27:38.325

THAT I DID MY BEST.

27:40.243 --> 27:41.953

GOOD HOME FOR YOU.

WHAT A FINE LADY

SHE'S GOT A BIG HOUSE.

28:11.983 --> 28:13.943

28:15.653 --> 28:17.447
SHE THOUGHT ALICIA WAS
ABOUT THE PRETTIEST THING

WILL BE ALL RIGHT...

VISIT LOTS OF TIMES.

EXPLAIN IT TO YOU.

I'M IN A HURRY.

32:46.591 --> 32:47.967

THE PUP TO TOWN.

WANT NELLIE TO HAVE HIM?

JUST LIKE ALICIA WILL.

IF HE'S HAPPY,

JUST SO HE'S GOT A HOME,

GONNA TAKE THE PUP

AT THE OLESONS'.

34:15.179 --> 34:16.764
NO, HE WON'T.

34:16.931 --> 34:19.517
THEN WHY ARE
YOU DOING IT?

34:19.684 --> 34:22.019
SAME REASON MY PA'S
DOING WHAT HE'S DOING.

34:22.186 --> 34:24.272
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

34:24.439 --> 34:27.525
YOU'RE GIVING THE PUP
TO NELLIE OUT OF ANGER.

34:27.692 --> 34:30.737

THE SAME THING AT ALL.

34:32.071 --> 34:33.906
YOU KNOW, LAURA...

34:35.366 --> 34:36.701
THERE ARE A LOT OF
DECISIONS

34:36.868 --> 34:38.828
WE HAVE
TO MAKE IN THIS LIFE

34:38.995 --> 34:40.705

WE DIDN'T HAVE TO.

34:40.872 --> 34:43.791
YOUR PA HAS MADE ONE
OF THOSE DECISIONS.

34:43.958 --> 34:45.918

ISN'T LEFT UP TO YOU.

TO A DEAR FRIEND.

34:59.098 --> 35:01.684
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO.

35:01.851 --> 35:03.269
HE COULD HAVE LEFT
THAT RESPONSIBILITY

35:03.436 --> 35:05.062
TO SOMEBODY ELSE...

35:05.229 --> 35:07.565
BUT HE DIDN'T.

IS BEST FOR THEIR FUTURE.

THE CHILDREN TODAY.

THEY WEREN'T CRYING...

35:35.176 --> 35:37.637

35:37.804 --> 35:39.680
THEY WERE WORRIED.

35:39.847 --> 35:43.935

BUT ABOUT YOUR PA.

35:46.187 --> 35:49.732
AND THEY ASKED ME
TO TELL HIM AGAIN

35:49.899 --> 35:55.238
NOT TO WORRY--
THAT THEY'D BE FINE.

HAS BEEN FOR YOUR FATHER,

36:25.893 --> 36:27.979

36:28.145 --> 36:30.231

TO HURT HIM.

36:30.398 --> 36:32.066
WELL, OF COURSE
YOU DIDN'T.

36:32.233 --> 36:33.651

MEANT TO GIVE

I WASN'T GOING TO?

36:39.365 --> 36:41.909

DIDN'T I?

36:42.076 --> 36:44.662
TO YOUR
FAVORITE PLACE?

36:44.829 --> 36:47.081
I KNEW YOU WEREN'T
GOING INTO TOWN.

THE FIELDS WHEN I CAME HOME.

36:57.842 --> 37:00.094
HE'S PROBABLY STILL THERE.

37:02.346 --> 37:05.141
WHAT SHOULD I SAY?

37:05.308 --> 37:07.768
YOU WON'T HAVE
TO SAY A THING.

37:07.935 --> 37:09.812
JUST GO TO HIM.

38:04.325 --> 38:07.244

THE LARGER NEEDLES.

38:07.411 --> 38:10.581
AT THE RATE I'M GOING, I'M
NEVER GONNA FINISH THIS.

TO GIVE IT TO HER.

PUT IT IN THE POST.

38:28.933 --> 38:31.602

38:33.771 --> 38:36.148

KNOW HOW TO KNIT.

38:37.733 --> 38:40.861

ABOUT YOUR KNITTING.

ABOUT YOU...

AND THE WAY YOU'VE

38:44.740 --> 38:46.993
TAKEN OVER THESE KIDS
LIKE THEY WAS YOUR OWN.

WELL,
WHAT ABOUT YOURSELF?

38:53.958 --> 38:55.584
YOU'VE SPENT
SO MUCH TIME HERE,

38:55.751 --> 38:57.545

ARE BEGINNING TO TALK.

39:17.481 --> 39:18.649
I SUPPOSE.

39:18.816 --> 39:21.235
BUT WHAT'S DONE
IS DONE.

39:25.823 --> 39:28.242
WE'RE ALL PACKED UP.

39:29.869 --> 39:32.121

FORGET ANYTHING?

NO REASON FOR THAT.

GET ON TO BED.

HAVE TO GET UP EARLY.

NOT JUST THE ONES
THAT ARE SPECIAL.

40:37.937 --> 40:41.816
BECAUSE ALL OF OUR DAYS
HERE ON GOD'S EARTH ARE SPECIAL.

40:41.982 --> 40:43.484
REMEMBER THAT
THIS THANKSGIVING DAY

40:43.651 --> 40:45.194
SO YOUR HEARTS MAY BE
FILLED WITH JOY AND LOVE
