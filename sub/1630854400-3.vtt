WEBVTT

00:03.699 --> 00:06.310
Hey, Randall.

00:06.310 --> 00:07.442
I'm just heading out,
so let me call you in a bit.

00:07.442 --> 00:09.183
Gonna play golf with my mom.

00:09.183 --> 00:11.446
Yes, I play golf now.

00:11.446 --> 00:14.623
No, not professionally,
because golf is really hard.

00:14.623 --> 00:15.711
I bet you could be

00:15.711 --> 00:17.191
a professional
anything you wanted.

00:17.191 --> 00:19.715
How come I never hear you
drive up?

00:19.715 --> 00:21.325
Is my speaker box broken?
- We need to talk

00:21.325 --> 00:22.848
about you turning down
the president.

00:22.848 --> 00:24.024
I have a tee time.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.286
I'll text your mom
and explain.

00:25.286 --> 00:27.244
She'll understand.
- You text with my mom?

00:27.244 --> 00:29.681
We're on a "Chicago Fire"
group chat.

00:29.681 --> 00:31.074
Text the big guy's mama.

00:31.074 --> 00:32.815
<i>- What would you like to say?</i>
- Tell her, uh,

00:32.815 --> 00:34.208
Dewey can't make it.

00:34.208 --> 00:36.862
Uh, he needs to meet
with his best friend.

00:36.862 --> 00:39.169
<i>Message sent.</i>

00:39.169 --> 00:41.084
The country is in crisis,
he said.

00:41.084 --> 00:43.043
It's a national emergency,
he said.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.740
Taft just wants me
to save his ass.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.350
I mean, you remember
that dirty campaign

00:46.350 --> 00:47.960
he ran against me.
Why would I help him?

00:47.960 --> 00:49.571
For the greater good?

00:49.571 --> 00:51.529
Haven't you worked with someone
you don't like before?

00:51.529 --> 00:53.488
And don't say me.
- Yes, of course I have.

00:55.316 --> 00:57.231
You're under the shade, man.
You don't need all that.

00:57.231 --> 00:59.363
Oh, um, I don't trust
the umbrella fabric.

00:59.363 --> 01:04.716
Oh.
It's your mom.

01:04.716 --> 01:06.501
She texted
three middle fingers.

01:06.501 --> 01:08.024
Where is that emoji?

01:08.024 --> 01:09.286
<i>Incoming call.</i>

01:09.286 --> 01:10.331
Now she's calling.
She always does this.

01:10.331 --> 01:11.506
She texts, and then she calls

01:11.506 --> 01:13.725
before I can even text
her back.

01:13.725 --> 01:15.814
<i>Why would you ruin
a golf day with my son?</i>

01:15.814 --> 01:17.903
<i>I just got a new visor.</i>
- Hey, Mom.

01:17.903 --> 01:19.557
I'm sorry, I got caught up here
with Randall.

01:19.557 --> 01:20.819
It's okay.
Go ahead and play our round.

01:20.819 --> 01:22.125
I'll see you soon.

01:22.125 --> 01:23.387
<i>Okay.
Well, I'm gonna win, then.</i>

01:23.387 --> 01:25.041
<i>I'm gonna put down that I won.</i>

01:25.041 --> 01:26.477
Technically, you shouldn't
put down that you won,

01:26.477 --> 01:27.739
'cause we have
to play the game.

01:27.739 --> 01:29.001
Why don't you go get
something to eat, Ma?

01:29.001 --> 01:29.959
It's all good.
I'll see you soon.

01:29.959 --> 01:31.352
<i>Okay. Bye, Dewey.</i>

01:31.352 --> 01:33.745
<i>Randall, why do you have
so much sunscreen on?</i>

01:33.745 --> 01:35.225
Okay, bye.

01:35.225 --> 01:36.618
I love her so much.

01:36.618 --> 01:38.185
You know, it's perfect
that she called, actually,

01:38.185 --> 01:40.665
as we're talking about people
we don't like working with,

01:40.665 --> 01:42.754
because that's become legend
in my family,

01:42.754 --> 01:45.192
like when my mom had to work
with Lars Anderson

01:45.192 --> 01:46.497
at Polynesian Pro Wrestling.

01:46.497 --> 01:47.803
Yeah, I remember
you telling me about that,

01:47.803 --> 01:49.935
how she gave Lars a chance
despite the fact

01:49.935 --> 01:51.850
that she was frustrated
that Lia hired him.

01:51.850 --> 01:53.852
Yeah, that's right.
That was in 1985.

01:53.852 --> 01:56.028
And my mom was working
for my grandmother's promotion,

01:56.028 --> 01:58.335
and my dad was wrestling
in the WWF.

01:58.335 --> 01:59.771
<i>He and Tony Atlas
were the first</i>

01:59.771 --> 02:02.644
<i>Black tag team champions
in WWF history.</i>

02:02.644 --> 02:04.776
<i>But their championship run
came to an abrupt end.</i>

02:04.776 --> 02:07.692
<i>And Adrian Adonis pins
Rocky Johnson!</i>

02:07.692 --> 02:09.259
<i>One, two, three!</i>

02:09.259 --> 02:11.131
<i>I can't believe it!</i>

02:11.131 --> 02:13.959
<i>The Soul Patrol has lost
the Tag Team Championship.</i>

02:17.267 --> 02:19.443
<i>Losing the belt
after he went to Saudi Arabia</i>

02:19.443 --> 02:21.228
<i>would have concerned
most people,</i>

02:21.228 --> 02:23.186
<i>especially after Vince's
"joke"...</i>

02:23.186 --> 02:24.231
Can you do me a favor
real quick?

02:24.231 --> 02:25.449
Yeah.

02:25.449 --> 02:26.711
Can you get that knife
out of my back?

02:26.711 --> 02:28.713
<i>But not my dad.</i>

02:28.713 --> 02:30.411
<i>His weekly paycheck
reassured him</i>

02:30.411 --> 02:32.239
<i>that things were just fine.</i>

02:34.502 --> 02:37.983
Surprise, surprise.
You brought a stowaway.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.642
Mama say, mama sa.

02:44.642 --> 02:46.644
Just picked up these bad boys.

02:46.644 --> 02:48.820
Givenchy, baby.

02:50.344 --> 02:53.477
Now, those are some resplendent
spectacÃ¡les, my brother.

02:53.477 --> 02:56.219
Ooh, yeah.
- Hey!

02:56.219 --> 02:58.090
Eh, let the Sheik
try them on.

02:58.090 --> 02:59.570
Come on. Share the sugar.

02:59.570 --> 03:02.094
And let your big melon head
stress the hinges?

03:02.094 --> 03:03.357
Not a chance.

03:03.357 --> 03:04.880
Now, why didn't you get me
a pair, Rock?

03:04.880 --> 03:06.186
What, we lose our belts

03:06.186 --> 03:07.535
and we don't take care
of each other anymore?

03:07.535 --> 03:09.406
When'd we ever
buy each other things?

03:09.406 --> 03:10.842
- Probably never.
- Ah.

03:10.842 --> 03:12.583
But I do feel like
you owe me something

03:12.583 --> 03:14.759
after you cost us our belts
by pissing off Vince.

03:14.759 --> 03:16.935
Come on, Tone.
Vince isn't pissed.

03:16.935 --> 03:18.502
Everything's good.

03:18.502 --> 03:20.591
We weren't gonna keep
the belts forever.

03:20.591 --> 03:23.246
And now this sets us up
for an epic comeback.

03:23.246 --> 03:25.248
Ah, come on, Rock.

03:26.858 --> 03:28.817
Sheik, coaster!

03:30.384 --> 03:32.516
Come on, man.
She's the queen of the jungle.

03:32.516 --> 03:34.257
Show a little respect.

03:34.257 --> 03:35.737
Why is it always
staring at me?

03:35.737 --> 03:37.565
Ack, I block you.

03:39.088 --> 03:40.698
Whoa.

03:40.698 --> 03:42.744
Cool glasses, Dad.
- You like 'em?

03:42.744 --> 03:45.225
You look like a richer
Black Elvis.

03:46.617 --> 03:49.272
That's exactly
what I was going for.

03:49.272 --> 03:51.100
<i>Meanwhile, my mom had
her hands full</i>

03:51.100 --> 03:53.233
<i>with Polynesian Pro Wrestling.</i>

03:53.233 --> 03:54.886
<i>"WrestleMania" was a huge hit,</i>

03:54.886 --> 03:58.368
<i>and it made wrestling
even more popular in Hawaii.</i>

03:59.195 --> 04:01.850
<i>The only downside
was Lia's new hire,</i>

04:01.850 --> 04:03.199
<i>Lars Anderson.</i>

04:05.593 --> 04:07.769
And then the bag rips
at the bottom, right?

04:07.769 --> 04:10.380
And all the barbecued pig feet
just come tumblin' all out

04:10.380 --> 04:12.382
over the lobby
of the Hotel Bel-Air.

04:12.382 --> 04:15.080
But Aretha,
she just calmly walks

04:15.080 --> 04:17.344
onto the elevator and leaves
like nothing ever happened.

04:17.344 --> 04:19.476
- She didn't say anything?
- Not a word.

04:19.476 --> 04:21.217
First time anyone's ever
said that about Aretha.

04:25.613 --> 04:28.268
Hi, Lars.
Allen was just telling a story

04:28.268 --> 04:29.399
about working
for the Queen of Soul.

04:29.399 --> 04:31.096
Little Richard?

04:31.096 --> 04:33.577
- Aretha Franklin.
- Oh.

04:33.577 --> 04:37.407
Hey, there's a cup of dip spit
on the fax machine.

04:38.365 --> 04:40.149
Thanks, Ata.

04:40.845 --> 04:43.413
Mm. He needs to lay off
the baby oil.

04:43.413 --> 04:45.023
But hey, how's it been
working with Lars

04:45.023 --> 04:46.895
the last couple weeks?

04:47.504 --> 04:48.418
Yeah, it's good.

04:48.418 --> 04:49.419
<i>But it wasn't good.</i>

04:49.419 --> 04:51.073
<i>As a wrestler, that also meant</i>

04:51.073 --> 04:52.901
<i>the booker, Lars,
immediately crowned himself</i>

04:52.901 --> 04:54.381
<i>PPPW champion.</i>

04:54.381 --> 04:56.600
Give me that. Behold!

04:56.600 --> 05:00.169
Number one! Lars the champion!

05:00.169 --> 05:04.391
<i>His abrasive personality
alienated a lot of wrestlers.</i>

05:04.391 --> 05:05.696
Too fat.

05:07.045 --> 05:08.830
The snake too.

05:09.874 --> 05:12.399
<i>And like I said earlier,
my mom was not a fan.</i>

05:12.399 --> 05:14.357
We're gonna bring out
Andre's childhood nanny.

05:16.838 --> 05:19.884
<i>And his influence over my
grandmother was only growing.</i>

05:19.884 --> 05:22.322
I was thinking of using this
for part of my entrance music.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.498
Oh, Lah, you make me laugh.

05:24.498 --> 05:25.890
<i>Wait, who made her laugh?</i>

05:25.890 --> 05:28.066
<i>The Lord?
- No, Lah.</i>

05:28.066 --> 05:29.503
<i>That's how she pronounced
"Lars."</i>

05:29.503 --> 05:32.114
<i>And for my mom,
Lah was a problem.</i>

05:37.206 --> 05:39.164
Don't answer that.

05:39.164 --> 05:40.688
- Why not?
- It's Afa.

05:40.688 --> 05:41.950
He's still mad at me
for bailing

05:41.950 --> 05:43.691
on his match in Saudi Arabia.

05:43.691 --> 05:45.780
So you're just going
to avoid him forever?

05:45.780 --> 05:47.042
Till one of us passes away, yeah.

05:47.042 --> 05:48.348
Great.

05:49.479 --> 05:51.133
Oh, Rocky, today's rent day.

05:51.133 --> 05:52.569
Can you put the check
in the box?

05:52.569 --> 05:54.310
No problem. It's payday,
so when the mail comes,

05:54.310 --> 05:56.007
I'll cut the ole bastard
a check.

05:56.007 --> 05:57.313
Thanks.
And don't say "bastard"

05:57.313 --> 05:58.314
in front of Dewey.

05:58.314 --> 05:59.794
Please?
- Okay.

06:02.797 --> 06:04.886
<i>My dad checked the mail
for a week.</i>

06:08.150 --> 06:10.065
<i>Nothing.</i>

06:10.065 --> 06:11.327
And what were you up to
during that time?

06:11.327 --> 06:12.720
I wanted a Nintendo.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.374
Oh, yeah?
Uh, "Mario Brothers"?

06:14.374 --> 06:15.418
I was more
of a "Metroid" guy.

06:15.418 --> 06:17.028
- Love "Metroid."
- Yeah.

06:17.028 --> 06:18.290
What about how you got
to the end

06:18.290 --> 06:19.553
and you realize
you were a girl?

06:19.553 --> 06:21.293
It was shocking.

06:21.293 --> 06:22.730
She takes off
her space helmet

06:22.730 --> 06:25.472
for the big reveal.
- Yes. Amazing storytelling.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.343
You know,
getting a Nintendo back then

06:27.343 --> 06:28.910
was a real pivotal time
in my life.

06:28.910 --> 06:31.260
I was trying to navigate my way
through the ups and downs

06:31.260 --> 06:33.044
of middle school popularity.

06:33.697 --> 06:35.699
It just fits in your hands
really nice and smooth.

06:35.699 --> 06:36.874
all: Whoa.

06:36.874 --> 06:38.180
You guys talking eggs?

06:38.180 --> 06:40.661
No, we're talking Nintendo.

06:40.661 --> 06:41.879
What's Nintendo?

06:43.490 --> 06:46.580
It's only the coolest
video game system ever made.

06:46.580 --> 06:48.059
Guess I haven't had time
to hear about it

06:48.059 --> 06:50.453
since I was at Cyndi Lauper's
party in New York City

06:50.453 --> 06:52.542
with my dad,
wrestler Rocky Johnson.

06:52.542 --> 06:53.761
Whoa.

06:53.761 --> 06:55.415
You mean the guy
that just lost

06:55.415 --> 06:56.764
the championship belt?

06:56.764 --> 06:59.767
Well, um, this is
Cyndi Lauper's bangle.

06:59.767 --> 07:02.900
Sure, Dewey, and this is
Bette Midler's Casio.

07:02.900 --> 07:05.816
Anyways, as I was saying...

07:05.816 --> 07:08.950
<i>So like my mom, I had
my own problems to deal with.</i>

07:10.299 --> 07:12.562
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Pat! Rocky Johnson here.

07:12.562 --> 07:14.695
<i>Rocky!
Hey, now's not a good time.</i>

07:14.695 --> 07:17.306
I got Louis' niece's birthday
and my hands are full here.

07:17.306 --> 07:18.612
Get off the damn phone

07:18.612 --> 07:20.004
and help me
with these balloons!

07:20.004 --> 07:21.484
Uh, just a minute, Louis.

07:21.484 --> 07:22.572
<i>Well, I'll make it quick.</i>

07:22.572 --> 07:24.052
I'm missing my paycheck
this week.

07:24.052 --> 07:25.836
Wanted to see if you knew
how I could track that down.

07:25.836 --> 07:27.751
- Oh.
<i>- Yeah, that last check I got</i>

07:27.751 --> 07:29.840
had that bonus,
which, by the way, thank you.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.800
But it's been--
<i>- Rocky, listen, uh...</i>

07:32.800 --> 07:34.497
<i>someone should have
called you.</i>

07:34.497 --> 07:36.325
That wasn't a bonus
in your last check.

07:36.325 --> 07:38.936
That was severance.

07:38.936 --> 07:40.285
Severance?

07:40.285 --> 07:42.418
<i>The WWF's not renewing
your contract.</i>

07:42.418 --> 07:44.420
Vince has decided to move on.

07:44.420 --> 07:46.901
<i>We'll, uh, talk to you soon,
eh?</i>

07:48.250 --> 07:51.471
- Who was that?
- Uh, Bad News Allen.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.081
What a character.

07:53.081 --> 07:54.386
I know, right? So amazing.

07:54.386 --> 07:55.779
All these sto--
- Okay, I don't have

07:55.779 --> 07:58.042
any time to explain,
but I need a Nintendo

07:58.042 --> 07:59.479
and I need it yesterday.

08:01.872 --> 08:03.570
Dad, did you hear me?

08:04.527 --> 08:05.833
- Uh, what?
- A Nintendo.

08:05.833 --> 08:06.964
It's a video game system.

08:06.964 --> 08:08.488
You already have a Tatari.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.707
Atari, Mom.
And nobody plays that anymore.

08:10.707 --> 08:12.013
Come on, please!

08:12.013 --> 08:13.667
Hey, you're not getting
another video game.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.364
Those things are expensive.
- Mm-hmm.

08:15.364 --> 08:16.452
It's not like
we made of money.

08:16.452 --> 08:18.280
But I thought we were rich.

08:18.280 --> 08:20.804
Of course we are,
but that's not the point.

08:20.804 --> 08:23.241
Know what? It's about time
you learned it.

08:23.241 --> 08:24.460
Yeah, you want
a Nintendo so bad,

08:24.460 --> 08:26.680
go buy it yourself.
- With what money?

08:26.680 --> 08:28.856
All I have are foreign coins
you bring back from trips.

08:28.856 --> 08:32.163
- So get a job.
- Mom, please. The Nintendo.

08:32.163 --> 08:34.688
I agree with your father.
Jobs build character.

08:34.688 --> 08:37.691
And I saw
the Golden Wok is hiring.

08:37.691 --> 08:39.562
Great.
I still don't have a Nintendo,

08:39.562 --> 08:41.172
and now I'm learning a lesson.

08:41.172 --> 08:42.565
This went terribly.

08:42.565 --> 08:45.176
All right, I'm off to work.

08:45.176 --> 08:47.570
Oh, the landlord left a message
about the rent being late.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.267
You put the check in the box, right?

08:49.267 --> 08:51.313
Yeah, I did do that. Yeah.

08:51.313 --> 08:53.271
Hey, don't worry.
I'll connect with him.

08:53.271 --> 08:54.795
Okay.

08:58.494 --> 08:59.930
Those babies
are 12-karat gold.

08:59.930 --> 09:02.542
- Mm-hmm.
- With over 250 rhinestones.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.370
Mm. Yeah, these are
fine shades, no question.

09:05.370 --> 09:06.589
I'll give you 80 bucks.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.460
Come on, man,
look at the hinges.

09:08.460 --> 09:10.288
They were made in Milan, Italy.

09:10.288 --> 09:12.726
Oh, these are
Milanese hinges.

09:12.726 --> 09:15.076
So you've heard?

09:15.076 --> 09:16.686
I'll give you 80 bucks.

09:17.905 --> 09:20.560
- Fine, weasel.
- All right.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.085
Isn't gonna be enough.

09:24.085 --> 09:25.608
It's not gonna be near enough.
- Hey, we--

09:25.608 --> 09:27.523
we buy a lot of things, man.

09:29.003 --> 09:30.482
What else you got?

09:37.751 --> 09:39.927
Hi. I'd like to apply
for a job.

09:39.927 --> 09:41.972
Yeah? Grab a seat.
I'll get the manager.

09:41.972 --> 09:43.147
Okay.

09:44.540 --> 09:46.020
Grandma?

09:46.847 --> 09:49.110
Why didn't you tell me
you needed a job?

09:49.110 --> 09:50.546
Uh...

09:50.546 --> 09:52.287
You need work, come to me.

09:52.287 --> 09:53.723
How'd you even know
I was coming here?

09:53.723 --> 09:55.464
I have birds
all over the city

09:55.464 --> 09:57.031
singing in my ear.

09:57.031 --> 10:00.121
Wait, does this mean
I can come work for PPPW?

10:00.121 --> 10:01.513
I insist on it.

10:01.513 --> 10:03.428
I don't want
my grandson working

10:03.428 --> 10:05.387
in this palace of filth.

10:09.130 --> 10:10.435
Disgusting.

10:10.435 --> 10:11.741
Wrap this to go

10:11.741 --> 10:13.787
with some
of those little mustards.

10:13.787 --> 10:15.919
<i>So as I got a surprise
at work,</i>

10:15.919 --> 10:19.314
<i>my mom was about
to have one at home.</i>

10:21.664 --> 10:23.187
Rocky?

10:23.187 --> 10:24.885
Now, before you ask...

10:24.885 --> 10:25.973
I paid the rent.

10:25.973 --> 10:27.539
What have you done
to your hair?

10:27.539 --> 10:29.672
- You like it?
- You look like Grace Jones.

10:29.672 --> 10:32.675
- Oh, is that a yes?
- No! It's a no.

10:32.675 --> 10:35.025
Why did you do this?
- It's my new persona.

10:35.025 --> 10:38.420
I was sensing Rocky Johnson
just wasn't poppin' anymore,

10:38.420 --> 10:39.856
so I figured it was time
for a change.

10:39.856 --> 10:43.686
Ladies and gentlemen, say hello
to Big Papa Daddy.

10:45.166 --> 10:47.647
Yeah, gonna send a photo
to Vince, see what he thinks.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.693
So where is our coffee table?

10:50.693 --> 10:53.261
Oh, it's, um,
at the furniture store

10:53.261 --> 10:55.393
getting polished.
- Rocky, what's going on?

10:55.393 --> 10:57.265
The furniture? Your hair?

10:57.265 --> 10:58.832
No spin. Tell me the truth.

10:58.832 --> 11:00.834
But I-I am tell--

11:04.925 --> 11:07.579
I pawned the furniture
to pay rent

11:07.579 --> 11:12.323
because Pat says I'm done
at the WWF.

11:12.323 --> 11:14.151
- What?
- The whole Saudi Arabia thing,

11:14.151 --> 11:17.154
Vince isn't lettin' it go.

11:17.154 --> 11:19.722
So he didn't renew my contract.

11:19.722 --> 11:21.724
I was waiting
for the right time to tell you,

11:21.724 --> 11:23.421
but I-I just thought
maybe if I changed things up

11:23.421 --> 11:25.293
that Vince would--
- Take you back?

11:26.773 --> 11:28.644
Oh, Rocky.

11:30.472 --> 11:32.996
- You're not mad at me?
- Mad at you?

11:34.781 --> 11:37.914
Rocky, you and me are a team.

11:37.914 --> 11:41.396
What happens to you
happens to me.

11:41.396 --> 11:43.920
And if you're out at the WWF,

11:43.920 --> 11:47.837
then that's their loss
and PPPW's gain.

11:47.837 --> 11:49.317
I'm gonna set up a meeting
with my mom

11:49.317 --> 11:52.320
so we can talk about you
wrestling in Hawaii full-time.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.365
- Really?
- Yes.

11:54.365 --> 11:57.586
This is why we have
a family business--

11:57.586 --> 12:00.067
to take care of family.

12:00.067 --> 12:02.373
And honestly, I wouldn't mind
having you by my side

12:02.373 --> 12:04.724
as I deal
with this whole Lars situation.

12:05.420 --> 12:07.117
I love you.

12:07.117 --> 12:10.904
Ooh, I'm gonna need a minute
to get used to the hair.

12:15.517 --> 12:16.823
There he is,
the working man.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.607
Hi, Dewey.
How's the job going?

12:18.607 --> 12:20.304
- Boring.
- Sounds like work to me.

12:24.831 --> 12:27.616
Uh, Mom, I thought you said
this was a private meeting.

12:27.616 --> 12:29.487
It's work-related, isn't it?

12:29.487 --> 12:31.881
Lah is part of the business.
He stays.

12:35.363 --> 12:37.582
Nice boots.

12:37.582 --> 12:38.975
Where's the rodeo?

12:38.975 --> 12:40.281
Nice outfit.

12:40.281 --> 12:41.804
If you need some pants,
I can loan you some.

12:41.804 --> 12:44.938
Oh, I only buy pants
from one man: Calvin Klein.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.899
Now, what did you
want to talk to me about?

12:49.899 --> 12:53.642
Uh, the WWF didn't renew
my contract.

12:53.642 --> 12:56.732
Saudi Arabia.

12:56.732 --> 12:58.690
So I was thinking
we could bring Rocky

12:58.690 --> 13:01.258
into PPPW full-time.

13:01.258 --> 13:02.607
He's a huge draw in Hawaii,

13:02.607 --> 13:04.261
and I think he could generate
more ticket sales

13:04.261 --> 13:06.002
and improve our TV ratings.

13:07.743 --> 13:09.310
I think that's a great idea.

13:09.310 --> 13:12.443
- Amazing.
- Really appreciate this, Lia.

13:14.097 --> 13:16.186
- Yes, Lah?
- Playing devil's advocate,

13:16.186 --> 13:17.927
it's a bit of a conflict
of interest, isn't it,

13:17.927 --> 13:19.407
a wife hiring a husband?

13:19.407 --> 13:20.887
No more of conflict
than a booker booking himself

13:20.887 --> 13:22.802
as the headliner.
- Yeah, there's no conflict

13:22.802 --> 13:25.630
putting a WWF champ
in the ring.

13:25.630 --> 13:26.849
Former champ.

13:26.849 --> 13:28.546
There's only one champ
in this room.

13:28.546 --> 13:29.983
That's me.

13:29.983 --> 13:31.723
Does it count if you put
the belt on yourself?

13:31.723 --> 13:33.551
Who cares?
Least I still got the belt.

13:33.551 --> 13:34.726
What do you got?

13:34.726 --> 13:36.816
I got the ability
to beat your ass.

13:36.816 --> 13:37.817
Please.

13:37.817 --> 13:38.992
You couldn't beat an old lady

13:38.992 --> 13:41.124
to the line
at a seafood buffet.

13:41.124 --> 13:43.823
Well, I don't eat seafood,
so that's irrelevant.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.389
Enough!

13:45.389 --> 13:46.913
Rocky comes back full-time.

13:46.913 --> 13:49.698
But the three of you need
to find a way to get along.

13:53.528 --> 13:55.095
<i>That Lars
is something else.</i>

13:55.095 --> 13:57.053
Yeah, he was a lot
to deal with.

13:57.053 --> 13:58.707
But, you know, I learned
a little bit from him too.

13:58.707 --> 14:00.578
I hope
it wasn't his fashion sense.

14:00.578 --> 14:02.058
No, that only worked for him
and Donald Duck.

14:02.058 --> 14:03.755
I learned that there was

14:03.755 --> 14:05.627
more to Lars
than everybody assumed.

14:05.627 --> 14:08.325
<i>I was hard at work at PPPW.</i>

14:08.325 --> 14:10.806
Damn, Dewey, you're
an envelope-sealing machine.

14:10.806 --> 14:13.026
Every envelope I seal
makes me one step closer

14:13.026 --> 14:14.418
to getting the Nintendo.

14:14.418 --> 14:16.333
Son, you work by the hour,
not by the envelope.

14:16.333 --> 14:17.334
- What?
- Hey, do me a favor.

14:17.334 --> 14:18.640
Can you drop these off?

14:18.640 --> 14:19.641
They're receipts.
She's been looking for 'em.

14:19.641 --> 14:20.947
Thanks, bud.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.734
And we switch
from Pepper to Pibb.

14:25.734 --> 14:27.518
Pibb, are you sure?

14:27.518 --> 14:29.694
We stand to rake in
an extra 15%.

14:29.694 --> 14:32.132
<i>So Lars did have
some business sense.</i>

14:32.132 --> 14:34.438
<i>He did.
And some common sense too.</i>

14:36.484 --> 14:38.094
- Is there anything else?
- It's Rocky.

14:38.094 --> 14:40.314
I still don't think
it's a good idea.

14:40.314 --> 14:42.664
Rocky is one of us, Lah.

14:42.664 --> 14:44.535
Look, I get
why you're bailing him out.

14:44.535 --> 14:46.886
His gold is gone.
His jewels are gone.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.670
Clearly he has
some sort of money trouble.

14:48.670 --> 14:50.106
But be careful.

14:50.106 --> 14:52.500
I have a feeling
he's selling something

14:52.500 --> 14:54.458
people are tired of buying.

15:00.029 --> 15:04.686
<i>Rocky "Soulman" Johnson
making his triumphant return</i>

15:04.686 --> 15:06.818
<i>to Polynesian Pacific
Pro Wrestling.</i>

15:06.818 --> 15:09.125
Great to be working
with you again, Rock.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.474
How you want to take us home?

15:10.474 --> 15:11.954
Dropkick.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.956
Uh, shoot off the ropes,
sunset flip--

15:16.959 --> 15:17.960
The hell is that?

15:17.960 --> 15:19.440
Here we go.

15:19.440 --> 15:20.876
What's happening?

15:20.876 --> 15:22.834
Welcome to wrestling
for Lars Anderson.

15:24.184 --> 15:27.143
Boo? No boo! Oh, shut up.

15:27.143 --> 15:28.884
Get out of here.

15:32.540 --> 15:33.802
What the hell are you doing, man?

15:33.802 --> 15:36.022
This is my return match.
- Change of plans.

15:36.022 --> 15:38.328
<i>My dad was pissed,
but he was a pro,</i>

15:38.328 --> 15:39.677
<i>and he sold for Lars.</i>

15:41.636 --> 15:43.768
Aah!

15:50.993 --> 15:52.342
20 years in this business,

15:52.342 --> 15:54.518
I ain't never been
more disrespected.

15:54.518 --> 15:56.912
Now you see
what I'm dealing with.

15:56.912 --> 15:58.522
Hey, Swiss Miss.

15:58.522 --> 15:59.697
What the hell was that?

15:59.697 --> 16:01.699
Rocky, you sound upset.
What's wrong?

16:01.699 --> 16:04.311
Don't mess with me, Lars.
This was my return match,

16:04.311 --> 16:05.660
and you took all the shine
for yourself.

16:05.660 --> 16:07.183
Disagree.

16:07.183 --> 16:09.707
Me crashing your match had
the fans poppin' like crazy.

16:09.707 --> 16:10.970
Tonight wasn't about you, Lars.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.536
It was about Rocky.
- See, that's where

16:12.536 --> 16:14.843
I get confused,
'cause the last time I checked,

16:14.843 --> 16:17.237
I was the booker
and I call the shots.

16:17.237 --> 16:18.760
No. We're equals.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.544
Well, if we're equals,
then my back is aching

16:20.544 --> 16:22.894
from carrying you
night after night.

16:22.894 --> 16:24.548
Now, if you excuse me,

16:24.548 --> 16:26.550
I'm gonna get
my post-show bratwurst.

16:28.422 --> 16:30.554
- What do we do?
- We can't go on like this.

16:30.554 --> 16:31.860
We need to talk to my mom.

16:31.860 --> 16:33.035
<i>While my parents
were dealing</i>

16:33.035 --> 16:34.906
<i>with their frustration
with Lars,</i>

16:34.906 --> 16:36.517
<i>I was wondering
if what I overheard him say</i>

16:36.517 --> 16:37.909
<i>about my dad was true.</i>

16:37.909 --> 16:41.391
Does my dad look...
different to you?

16:41.391 --> 16:43.872
Oh, the hair?
Yeah, it's rough stuff.

16:46.483 --> 16:49.356
Hey, Dad,
where's your sunglasses?

16:49.356 --> 16:51.880
Oh, um, just getting them
cleaned, son.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.838
Gotta keep
them rhinestones shining.

16:53.838 --> 16:55.971
Could you go grab my bag
for me, Dew?

17:04.545 --> 17:07.635
<i>Now I knew what happened
to my dad's glasses.</i>

17:08.940 --> 17:11.639
Should we order
the calamari for the table?

17:11.639 --> 17:15.556
Maybe two orders.
I only eat the ones with legs.

17:15.556 --> 17:18.776
- Tentacles, Mom.
- How come Dewey isn't here?

17:18.776 --> 17:22.215
Because we wanted to talk
to you about something,

17:22.215 --> 17:24.391
just us adults.

17:24.391 --> 17:26.306
- Divorce.
- No.

17:27.350 --> 17:29.831
It's about Lars.
- Lah?

17:29.831 --> 17:32.225
You saw how he was
at Saturday's match--

17:32.225 --> 17:33.661
going off script,

17:33.661 --> 17:35.619
stealing the spotlight
from Rocky.

17:35.619 --> 17:37.969
He's becoming very difficult
to work with.

17:37.969 --> 17:40.407
And it's not just me.
The other guys think so too.

17:40.407 --> 17:43.714
- Mm, Lah can be a lot.
- Exactly,

17:43.714 --> 17:45.847
which is what we wanted
to talk to you about.

17:45.847 --> 17:48.893
Look, me and the guys,
we all loved wrestling for PPPW

17:48.893 --> 17:51.461
because it felt
like a family business.

17:51.461 --> 17:53.985
Lars changed that.
It's just not the same.

17:53.985 --> 17:57.424
What we're saying is,
we can't work with him anymore.

17:58.512 --> 18:01.080
Either Lars goes, or we go.

18:01.080 --> 18:05.258
You are right.
PPPW is a family business.

18:05.258 --> 18:09.436
But it's also my business.
And business is good.

18:09.436 --> 18:12.178
And Lah is part of that.
- Is he, though, Ma?

18:12.178 --> 18:13.396
We were doing fine without him.

18:13.396 --> 18:15.833
But we are doing better
with him.

18:15.833 --> 18:19.489
Our profits have increased
ever since he joined.

18:19.489 --> 18:21.796
He has a good business sense.

18:21.796 --> 18:26.540
We went from Pepper to Pibb,
and that's money in my pocket.

18:26.540 --> 18:29.151
That's good business.
That's Lah.

18:29.151 --> 18:30.848
And Lah stays.

18:36.811 --> 18:39.161
- Then we're leaving.
- Oh, stop being silly.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.510
I'm serious, Mom.

18:40.510 --> 18:42.164
We're leaving,
and we're starting

18:42.164 --> 18:44.688
our own wrestling promotion--

18:44.688 --> 18:46.690
one that resembles
what PPPW was

18:46.690 --> 18:49.345
before Lars Anderson
got his hands on it.

18:58.441 --> 19:02.097
I wish the both of you
the best of luck.

19:02.097 --> 19:05.448
And, um, shall we order
some onion rings?

19:06.841 --> 19:08.843
<i>And that's when my mom
left the business.</i>

19:08.843 --> 19:10.540
So she didn't swallow
her pride at all

19:10.540 --> 19:12.542
for the greater good;
she quit--

19:12.542 --> 19:13.891
basically the exact opposite

19:13.891 --> 19:15.632
of what I'm telling you to do
with Taft.

19:15.632 --> 19:17.721
- Basically, yes.
- Hmm.

19:17.721 --> 19:19.767
Mm, guess I see
where you're coming from.

19:21.072 --> 19:22.857
So what happened
with you and the Nintendo?

19:22.857 --> 19:25.425
Oh, I got a lot of story
to tell there.

19:25.425 --> 19:26.730
- Hmm.
- Wow, you are really going

19:26.730 --> 19:28.167
to town on those things, huh?

19:28.167 --> 19:30.647
Mm, sorry, I think
I'm dehydrated.

19:30.647 --> 19:32.345
You want some?
- No, man.

19:32.345 --> 19:33.911
It's just straight-up
lap melon.

19:33.911 --> 19:35.913
You've held it in your lap
for 30 minutes now.

19:35.913 --> 19:37.785
- Lap melon?
- Lap melon. You didn't share.

19:37.785 --> 19:40.701
You've only left me
the weird white pieces. No.

19:40.701 --> 19:42.920
It's weird.

19:43.530 --> 19:44.922
And then,
once we have a roster,

19:44.922 --> 19:46.707
we can start putting
the wheels in motion,

19:46.707 --> 19:48.099
make this dream a reality.

19:48.099 --> 19:51.755
Look at you, sexy boss lady.

19:51.755 --> 19:54.018
Oh, again, the hair.

19:54.758 --> 19:56.107
Oh, hi, honey.

19:56.107 --> 19:57.283
Hi, Mom.

19:57.283 --> 19:58.588
Guess who got paid.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.808
My son, the working man.

20:00.808 --> 20:02.113
Did you get that Nintendo?

20:02.113 --> 20:04.420
Nah, I spent the money
on something else.

20:04.420 --> 20:06.814
Thought you might be
missing these.

20:11.253 --> 20:13.168
How did you--

20:13.168 --> 20:14.735
oh, son, that--

20:14.735 --> 20:16.693
that guy at the pawnshop
was a friend of mine.

20:16.693 --> 20:17.955
He was just holding
these for me--

20:17.955 --> 20:19.218
Yeah, totally.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.263
But I thought
they look better on you

20:21.263 --> 20:23.004
than they do in a pawnshop.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.576
Wow, son.

20:29.576 --> 20:31.360
Those look better on you
than they do on me.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.449
I was gonna say it
if you weren't gonna say it.

20:33.449 --> 20:34.624
They're actually
kind of heavy.

20:34.624 --> 20:36.626
That's because
there's 250 rhinestones

20:36.626 --> 20:37.801
on those babies.

20:37.801 --> 20:40.456
249, actually. I counted.

20:40.456 --> 20:42.937
There's a gem missing
on the right side by the ear.

20:42.937 --> 20:45.896
Mm.
The wear and tear of time.

20:45.896 --> 20:48.595
<i>Buying those glasses
for your dad was a big move.</i>

20:48.595 --> 20:49.683
It wasn't what you wanted,

20:49.683 --> 20:50.771
but it was
for the greater good.

20:50.771 --> 20:51.989
Don't do that, Randall.

20:51.989 --> 20:53.469
You can't use my story
against me.

20:53.469 --> 20:54.514
Hey, I'm just working

20:54.514 --> 20:56.124
with what you're giving me.

20:56.124 --> 20:57.604
But the current situation's
more complicated than that.

20:57.604 --> 20:59.127
I've already said no.

20:59.127 --> 21:00.563
I'm not gonna go
crawling back to Taft.

21:00.563 --> 21:01.825
Why would I do that?

21:01.825 --> 21:03.087
But you've always sacrificed

21:03.087 --> 21:05.612
to help others
and to do the right thing.

21:05.612 --> 21:07.657
Look, what if I buy you
a Nintendo?

21:11.487 --> 21:13.968
I'll do it.

21:13.968 --> 21:15.578
But only for the good
of the country.

21:15.578 --> 21:16.840
Yes.

21:16.840 --> 21:17.928
Get your linen pants
out of storage,

21:17.928 --> 21:19.278
'cause we're going
to Gjelgjiughm.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.496
Oh, you know what?
I don't like linen on you.

21:20.496 --> 21:22.324
It bunches.
- Really?

21:22.324 --> 21:23.499
- Yeah.
- I always thought

21:23.499 --> 21:24.805
I looked good in linen. No?
- No.

21:24.805 --> 21:26.023
- Really?
- No.

21:26.023 --> 21:28.112
I could be your stylist
if you'd like.

21:28.112 --> 21:29.984
Nah, I'm good.
