00:01.180 --> 00:03.520
Gordon: <i> Previously
on "masterchef"...</i>

00:03.560 --> 00:07.270
We're hosting a wedding inside
the masterchef kitchen.

00:07.320 --> 00:09.820
- Oh, my god!
- Oh, wow.

00:09.860 --> 00:11.030
Oh, dear. Who cooked lobster?

00:11.070 --> 00:12.820
- Jamie.
- I messed it up.

00:12.860 --> 00:14.900
I need lobster plated. Let's go.

00:14.950 --> 00:16.530
- Blue team!
- Oh, my gosh.

00:16.580 --> 00:18.450
Gordon: The only thing we're
missing is the field.

00:18.490 --> 00:20.950
It's raw.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.910
It's ( bleep )
dinner for divorce.

00:22.960 --> 00:25.960
The team that will be
safe from elimination

00:26.000 --> 00:28.960
is blue team!

00:29.000 --> 00:31.840
Red team, you will be
facing elimination.

00:31.880 --> 00:34.510
<i> Tonight...</i>

00:34.550 --> 00:36.180
- AarÃ³n: Beef.
- Noah: Oh, boy.

00:36.220 --> 00:38.090
<i> ...We are firing up the grills</i>

00:38.140 --> 00:40.470
<i> for the first ever
masterchef barbecue.</i>

00:40.520 --> 00:43.060
Joe: History is being made
on our fantastic patio.

00:43.100 --> 00:44.980
- I'm a grill master.
- ( sighs )

00:45.020 --> 00:46.690
you've never worked a barbecue?

00:46.730 --> 00:48.610
No.

00:48.650 --> 00:50.570
<i> It's an elimination
challenge...</i>

00:50.610 --> 00:52.650
- Stop the clock.
-<i> ...With a sweet twist.</i>

00:52.690 --> 00:55.530
We decided today that your
main course isn't enough.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.200
Are you ( bleep ) kidding me?

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074

01:12.170 --> 01:14.840
Welcome, guys. Line up, please.

01:14.880 --> 01:18.130
- Oh, it's a grill. - Wuta: <i> It sucks
being the teamaptain and losing.</i>

01:18.180 --> 01:19.390
Let's go.

01:19.430 --> 01:21.050
I put a stacked team together.

01:21.100 --> 01:23.010
<i> And now I have to cook</i>

01:23.060 --> 01:25.390
against some of the strongest
cooks in the competition.

01:25.440 --> 01:29.100
So, I'm gonna have
to be on my a game.

01:29.150 --> 01:32.400
Welcome to the gorgeous
masterchef patio.

01:32.440 --> 01:35.940
Yesterday we had our
first ever wedding

01:35.990 --> 01:37.280
in the masterchef kitchen

01:37.320 --> 01:40.160
and in the end, the
blue team won.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.530
- Good job, guys.
- Good news for you guys

01:42.580 --> 01:43.700
is that you're all
safe from elimination.

01:43.750 --> 01:46.040
- Thank you.
- All of you,

01:46.080 --> 01:47.960
head up to that beautiful
balcony, kick back,

01:48.000 --> 01:49.920
and help yourselves to a drink.

01:49.960 --> 01:52.460
Shari: <i> I've been on every
losing team so far,</i>

01:52.500 --> 01:56.130
so I'm so happy right now.

01:56.170 --> 01:57.590
We get to drink
some cocktails...

01:57.630 --> 01:59.340
All: Cheers.

01:59.390 --> 02:00.970
...And just catch some rays.

02:01.010 --> 02:02.550
Red team, you know
what that means.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.970
Today you are
facing elimination.

02:05.020 --> 02:09.100
Wuta, you lost your voice
yesterday, but talk to us now.

02:09.150 --> 02:11.480
I had a game plan, and I
quickly abandoned my game plan

02:11.520 --> 02:15.230
because I didn't believe in
myself or my cooking abilities.

02:15.280 --> 02:19.110
I trusted my team and I
didn't trust myself.

02:19.160 --> 02:20.530
Jamie, I'm gonna be honest.

02:20.570 --> 02:22.780
I think you were overcomplicating
the entire dish.

02:22.830 --> 02:24.410
It was a wedding.

02:24.450 --> 02:27.250
It wasn't a dish where you
serve a lobster in a shell.

02:27.290 --> 02:28.960
It wasn't that kind
of moment, right?

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
- Yes, chef.
- All right, red team,

02:31.040 --> 02:33.040
please, all of you take
off those red aprons

02:33.090 --> 02:34.670
and put those black ones on.
Let's go.

02:34.710 --> 02:36.920
- Yes, chef.
- Jamie: <i> The team challenge,</i>

02:36.970 --> 02:38.800
it was kind of a crap show

02:38.840 --> 02:40.470
with regards to lobster,
and I know it's my fault.

02:40.510 --> 02:42.470
<i> And I'm fine taking my lumps,</i>

02:42.510 --> 02:44.140
but this is my chance
to redeem myself.

02:44.180 --> 02:45.720
<i> So, I'm gotta get
my head straight.</i>

02:45.770 --> 02:47.520
<i> It's just like
fishing tournament.</i>

02:47.560 --> 02:48.560
Every day is different. I
just gotta go do my thing.

02:48.600 --> 02:52.090
Today, youl be cooking out here.

02:52.110 --> 02:55.520
For the first time in
masterchef history...

02:55.570 --> 02:59.690
You'll be cooking while using a
summertime staple in america.

02:59.740 --> 03:00.990
It's practically a religion.

03:01.030 --> 03:03.530
We are going to grill.

03:03.580 --> 03:05.280
Hands up, who likes to grill?

03:05.330 --> 03:06.740
- Me, chef!
- Chef.

03:06.790 --> 03:08.290
- This guy.
- Gordon: Love it.

03:08.330 --> 03:09.250
Dorian: <i> Oh, man.</i>

03:09.290 --> 03:11.460
I grill at home all year round.

03:11.500 --> 03:14.460
<i> But I've never worked with a
gas grill before in my life,</i>

03:14.500 --> 03:16.960
so this is gonna be
a challenge for me.

03:17.010 --> 03:19.380
Keturah, have you ever
attended a barbecue?

03:19.420 --> 03:20.790
Yes.

03:20.800 --> 03:21.970
Have you ever cooked
on a barbecue?

03:22.010 --> 03:24.050
- No.
- Gordon: Oh, my lord.

03:24.100 --> 03:26.390
- You are from England, right?
- Yeah.

03:26.430 --> 03:28.970
You know that barbecues, how
famous they are back in the uk.

03:29.020 --> 03:30.980
I know but, like, other people
throw the parties and I go.

03:31.020 --> 03:32.770
Gordon: Wow.

03:32.810 --> 03:35.100
- But today we're breaking that, right?
- Yes.

03:35.150 --> 03:38.190
Well, there truly is
no better ingredient

03:38.240 --> 03:43.150
to sizzle up on those grills
than bold, beautiful beef!

03:43.200 --> 03:44.910
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, wow!

03:44.950 --> 03:46.200
- Oh, my gosh.
- It's what's for dinner.

03:46.240 --> 03:48.870
Let's roll. Let's roll. Let's roll.
Let's roll.

03:48.910 --> 03:51.000
- Let's roll. Let's roll.
- That's what I'm talking about.

03:51.040 --> 03:53.290
- Let's go.
- Micah: <i> Hell, yeah.</i>

03:53.330 --> 03:55.210
It's a fricking
cornucopia of meat.

03:55.250 --> 03:58.420
It's dang near the whole cow.
Beef is what's for dinner,

03:58.460 --> 04:01.340
<i> but beef is what's gonna send
me up to that white apron.</i>

04:01.380 --> 04:02.510
I'm so excited.

04:02.550 --> 04:04.130
Here we have a beautiful array

04:04.180 --> 04:05.840
of some of the best cuts

04:05.850 --> 04:09.760
that any grill master
can ever hope for.

04:09.810 --> 04:12.680
All provided by wonderful
beef ranchers and farmers.

04:12.730 --> 04:14.390
- Ooh.
- Gordon: Amazing.

04:14.440 --> 04:16.730
- Come on, guys.
- Tomahawk, baby.

04:16.769 --> 04:18.399
- Give me the tomahawk.
- How beautiful is that?

04:18.440 --> 04:19.610
- Gorgeous.
- Seriously?

04:19.649 --> 04:20.820
- Really?
- Keturah: Wow.

04:20.860 --> 04:22.740
We're gonna need
some big plates.

04:22.780 --> 04:26.310
You used to only be able to
get this quality of meat

04:26.320 --> 04:28.870
in fine dining restaurants
and steak houses.

04:28.910 --> 04:32.160
But now you can pick it up
at your local grocery store.

04:32.210 --> 04:36.170
Just consider this our very own
masterchef backyard barbecue.

04:36.210 --> 04:38.790
We're looking today
for a hearty plate.

04:38.840 --> 04:41.170
The beef should be the star.

04:41.210 --> 04:44.170
The dish should pop with flavors

04:44.220 --> 04:46.840
and excite just like a
summer firework show.

04:46.890 --> 04:50.760
Now, in addition to all
this mouthwatering beef,

04:50.850 --> 04:55.980
you will have access to the full
masterchef summer patio pantry

04:56.020 --> 04:58.600
to make your steak
dish sing today.

04:58.650 --> 05:04.070
The home cook with the worst
dish, sadly, will be eliminated.

05:04.110 --> 05:06.200
But the home cook with
the best dish today

05:06.240 --> 05:08.240
will win an awesome prize.

05:08.280 --> 05:11.950
Their recipe will
officially be published

05:12.000 --> 05:14.120
on the "beef-- it's what's
for dinner" website...

05:14.160 --> 05:16.040
- Unreal.
- Wow.

05:16.080 --> 05:18.290
...That is visited by
millions of people.

05:18.340 --> 05:20.460
- Yo!
- Yes.

05:20.500 --> 05:22.050
Now, today you'll
have one amazing hour

05:22.090 --> 05:25.130
to cook us a very
delicious, composed,

05:25.180 --> 05:26.550
grilled meat dish.

05:26.590 --> 05:28.630
- You guys ready?
- Yes, chef.

05:28.680 --> 05:33.850
Your one hour starts now.
Let's go, guys.

05:33.890 --> 05:36.480
- Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Sorry, sorry.

05:36.520 --> 05:39.310
Is this, like, a skirt steak?

05:39.360 --> 05:40.810
This is going to be hard for me.

05:40.860 --> 05:43.980
As a vegetarian, I'm
looking at these beef cuts

05:44.030 --> 05:46.400
<i> and I'm seeing
steaks with bones</i>

05:46.450 --> 05:48.360
that look like we're
on "the flintstones."

05:48.410 --> 05:51.120
- I've never seen that before.
- More rib eye there.

05:51.160 --> 05:54.540
Sarah: <i> Being from texas,
it's cattle land,</i>

05:54.580 --> 05:56.370
and we barbecue all the time.

05:56.370 --> 05:57.830
My kids love steak.

05:57.870 --> 05:59.460
And we barbecue all the time.
<i> I'm safe.</i>

05:59.500 --> 06:00.960
I'm not going home
tonight on this dish.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.590
Excuse me.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.460
Look at you, keturah!

06:04.510 --> 06:06.130
Not making any mistakes today.

06:06.170 --> 06:08.470
Wow, keturah, how many pieces
of steak you got there?

06:08.510 --> 06:09.590
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

06:09.640 --> 06:11.220
As someone who's never
grilled before,

06:11.260 --> 06:12.470
I'm trying my best to think
about all the things

06:12.510 --> 06:14.510
that could possibly go wrong.

06:14.560 --> 06:17.180
- So, our first masterchef backyard
barbecue. - Very exciting.

06:17.230 --> 06:18.480
- Gordon: What an amazing challenge.
- AarÃ³n: Absolutely.

06:18.520 --> 06:21.010
And everybody fancies themself

06:21.020 --> 06:22.060
a great backyard
barbecue warrior, right?

06:22.110 --> 06:24.150
- Sure.
- The weekend comes around,

06:24.190 --> 06:26.320
- you wanna impress your
family and friends. - Not me.

06:26.360 --> 06:28.530
- When I wanna grill, I go to your house.
- Oh, really? There you go.

06:28.570 --> 06:30.450
Let's talk about the
hero, the meat.

06:30.490 --> 06:32.240
- What cut would you use?
- I'm gonna go bone-in rib eye.

06:32.280 --> 06:33.660
- 100%, all day long.
- Gordon: Joe?

06:33.700 --> 06:36.120
I like a bit of a fattier steak,

06:36.160 --> 06:37.540
so I'll go with the
new york strip.

06:37.580 --> 06:39.830
Gordon: I'd take one
of those t-bones.

06:39.870 --> 06:42.040
The advantage of t-bone, you got the
strip loin and you got the fillet.

06:42.090 --> 06:45.000
- So that's a dream come true.
- Perfect.

06:45.050 --> 06:46.630
This is elimination, so we
need to elevate this tonight.

06:46.670 --> 06:49.760
Use the grill as your
backbone, but we wanna see

06:49.800 --> 06:52.390
- the attraction on the plate.
- Ah, here we go.

06:52.430 --> 06:54.680
It needs to be
restaurant quality.

06:54.720 --> 06:55.510
That's what they're gonna
struggle with today.

06:57.850 --> 07:00.270
- Ooh-wee!
- What are you putting in, noah?

07:00.310 --> 07:02.060
- Bourbon.
- Both: Ooh!

07:02.110 --> 07:03.900
It's pretty killer. I'm
really happy with that.

07:03.940 --> 07:06.190
Noah: <i> I've been
grilling my whole life.</i>

07:06.230 --> 07:10.140
Being a proud southerner, I
feel this is my wheelhouse.

07:10.160 --> 07:13.070
Are you kidding me, you're giving
me a grill? I'm a grill master.

07:13.120 --> 07:15.160
This is like michael phelps
in a fricking lap pool, okay?

07:15.200 --> 07:18.160
This is a natural habitat.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.540
It's not the right herb.

07:19.580 --> 07:22.420
Silverback gorilla in
a rainforest, okay?

07:22.450 --> 07:24.040
This is my jungle and I own it.

07:24.090 --> 07:26.170
We're rolling right now.

07:26.210 --> 07:27.500
Gordon: Just over
50 minutes to go.

07:27.550 --> 07:28.960
Get used to those cuts.

07:29.010 --> 07:31.800
Marinade it, cook it,
understand the flavor.

07:31.840 --> 07:34.390
- Okay.
- Right, young lady, how you feeling?

07:34.430 --> 07:36.550
- I'm really nervous, chef, I'm
not gonna lie to you. - Nervous?

07:36.600 --> 07:38.310
- Yeah.
- Nervous about what?

07:38.350 --> 07:40.560
Come on. Tell me about the dish.
What are you doing?

07:40.600 --> 07:44.310
Um, I'm making a steak of
some sort and then salad--

07:44.360 --> 07:46.520
a side salad with
walnut and apples,

07:46.570 --> 07:49.980
and then some sweet potato fries
with parmesan or pecorino.

07:50.030 --> 07:52.150
Wow. So you're going
all out, aren't you?

07:52.200 --> 07:53.650
- I hope so.
- You're not done yet, are you?

07:53.700 --> 07:56.030
- No.
- How upset would you be if you did leave?

07:56.080 --> 07:58.410
- I'd be really upset.
- Yeah. So would we.

07:58.450 --> 08:00.240
Start visualizing that
dish in your mind.

08:00.290 --> 08:03.410
- Okay, thank you, chef.
- You can do this, yes? Good luck.

08:03.460 --> 08:07.040
- Micah, how's it going, man?
- Going good, subha. Thank you.

08:07.090 --> 08:09.460
I started cooking every single
day when I was 12 years old.

08:09.510 --> 08:12.260
<i> I had to cook burgers and
meatballs for my family,</i>

08:12.300 --> 08:16.340
<i> but I've never worked with something
this nice in my entire life.</i>

08:16.390 --> 08:18.800
- âª yeah, baby âª -<i> the
quality of the beef</i>

08:18.850 --> 08:21.930
that they've given
us is amazing.

08:21.980 --> 08:25.940
Everything is top of the line,
and I'm so pumped for this.

08:25.980 --> 08:28.520
Gordon: Just over
40 minutes to go.

08:28.570 --> 08:30.690
- Looks great, noah.
- Thank you.

08:30.740 --> 08:33.030
- Us, southerners, we know how to cook.
- Gordon: Wow.

08:33.070 --> 08:35.280
- It smells delicious.
- Lot of grilling happening here.

08:35.320 --> 08:37.240
- Beautiful. Really good, indeed.
- Perfect.

08:37.280 --> 08:38.700
Joe: Jamie's cooking
with a vengeance today.

08:38.740 --> 08:40.370
- Yeah, jamie's going.
- He wants a comeback.

08:40.409 --> 08:42.539
- All right. - I thought that
giving a grilling challenge

08:42.580 --> 08:45.960
- would really have these people in
their comfort zone. - Oh, shoot.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.210
I see people like
keturah, dorian,

08:49.250 --> 08:50.550
who seem like they're
really in a panic

08:50.590 --> 08:52.510
- being behind a grill.
- Damn.

08:52.540 --> 08:53.460
That's really concerning.

08:53.510 --> 08:55.590
Then you see, like,
jamie and noah,

08:55.640 --> 08:57.590
and they look like they've been
behind a grill their whole lives.

08:57.640 --> 08:59.100
- Out here, there's no faking it.
- No.

08:59.140 --> 09:02.520
Did that go out? No. Okay.

09:02.560 --> 09:04.850
I'm feeling really anxious

09:04.890 --> 09:08.400
<i> because I am completely lost...</i>

09:08.440 --> 09:09.810
That's not even cooking.

09:09.860 --> 09:12.150
...And I don't like not
knowing how to do something.

09:12.190 --> 09:15.490
Think about it, think
about it, think about it.

09:15.530 --> 09:17.610
So, I'm freaking out right now.

09:17.660 --> 09:20.120
Guys, keturah's in a meltdown.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.660
What is going on?

09:21.700 --> 09:22.620
( keturah screams )

09:22.660 --> 09:23.910
( bleep )

09:23.960 --> 09:25.320
oh, what is she doing?

09:25.330 --> 09:27.540
Um-- oh, my god!

09:27.580 --> 09:30.380
( groans, sighs )

09:38.510 --> 09:40.800
that's not even cooking.

09:40.850 --> 09:43.600
Okay, focus, focus, focus.

09:43.640 --> 09:45.350
Just center yourself, keturah.
You got this.

09:45.390 --> 09:47.350
- Take a deep breath.
- Thanks.

09:47.400 --> 09:51.110
Keturah: <i> This challenge is
difficult, but I'm not giving up</i>

09:51.150 --> 09:54.110
because all I really wanna do
is take my love of cooking

09:54.150 --> 09:55.690
to a grander scale and
open my own restaurant.

09:55.740 --> 09:57.490
( sighs )

09:57.530 --> 10:00.240
<i>it's been a dream that I've
had since I was a kid.</i>

10:00.280 --> 10:03.660
So I have to buck up and
get it all together.

10:03.700 --> 10:05.200
Okay, you can do this.

10:05.250 --> 10:08.660
39 minutes remaining, guys.

10:08.710 --> 10:12.460
- Shari: Looking good, sarah! - How long
is the tomahawk gonna cook for, though?

10:12.500 --> 10:14.920
- Because that's a huge bone. - I don't
know how long you cook that thing for.

10:15.010 --> 10:16.210
That thing scares me.

10:16.260 --> 10:18.130
All right, do you have
enough meat there, sarah?

10:18.180 --> 10:20.180
You have carnage is
what you have, sarah.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.760
It was definitely a
food fight up there,

10:21.800 --> 10:23.430
- I gotta say.
- I got you.

10:23.470 --> 10:25.140
So what do you got going on?
Talk to us about your dish.

10:25.180 --> 10:27.340
I was fortunate enough
to get a tomahawk.

10:27.350 --> 10:29.270
Never worked with it, but
I'm gonna give it a try.

10:29.310 --> 10:33.190
I'm gonna do a brussels
sprout with bacon lardons.

10:33.230 --> 10:34.440
So who takes care of
the grilling duties?

10:34.480 --> 10:36.440
I would imagine you
do on the weekends.

10:36.490 --> 10:38.280
You know, when we found out
we were having twin boys,

10:38.320 --> 10:40.860
my husband wanted to go get the
most manly thing he could,

10:40.910 --> 10:42.660
- but I'm the grill master at our house.
- I love that.

10:42.700 --> 10:45.410
That's the way it should be.
Ladies rule in the kitchen.

10:45.450 --> 10:47.820
Thank you, chef. Thank you, joe.

10:47.830 --> 10:50.790
Subha: Smart work, jamie, showing
the south carolina style.

10:50.830 --> 10:53.080
- Show 'em how to do it.
- I'm trying, I'm trying.

10:53.130 --> 10:54.670
- Right, jamie, how you feeling?
- I feel good.

10:54.710 --> 10:55.990
Tell me about the dish.
What are you doing?

10:56.010 --> 10:57.460
So I'm gonna do a
tomahawk rib eye

10:57.510 --> 10:59.510
with anchovy butter and
a southern skillet

10:59.550 --> 11:00.680
- of creamed corn jalapeÃ±os.
- Smart.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.340
And then duck fat
fried broccolinis

11:02.390 --> 11:05.140
- with some small potatoes.
- Top ten is around the corner.

11:05.180 --> 11:06.930
- Can you come back strong
across this grill? - Yeah.

11:06.970 --> 11:08.560
I have no-- I have no doubts.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.390
Trying to redeem myself.
Trying to stay here.

11:10.440 --> 11:12.140
I think if I elevate this
just a little bit more

11:12.190 --> 11:13.730
than I would normally,
I think I'll be okay.

11:13.770 --> 11:16.070
- Good, good idea. Good luck, young man.
- Thank you so much.

11:16.110 --> 11:18.690
Jamie: <i> I have to deliver on
this challenge and get on top</i>

11:18.740 --> 11:21.030
<i> because I started a nonprofit.</i>

11:21.070 --> 11:23.610
<i> We rescue folks during
hurricanes and floods and stuff.</i>

11:23.660 --> 11:25.030
<i> And I wanna win this money</i>

11:25.080 --> 11:26.910
so that I can buy a food truck,

11:26.950 --> 11:29.950
and it'll give me an opportunity
to cook for these folks.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
- Jamie, it smells delicious.
- Thank you.

11:32.040 --> 11:33.420
This is his challenge.

11:33.460 --> 11:34.960
- Chef aarÃ³n.
- How are you?

11:35.000 --> 11:36.920
- I'm doing really well, chef.
- All right, well,

11:36.950 --> 11:39.210
- tell us your dish, noah.
- Look at those rubs. Wow.

11:39.260 --> 11:42.720
So, what we're gonna have is we're
gonna have a romesco sauce,

11:42.760 --> 11:44.550
roasted peppers, tomatoes
are on the grill right now.

11:44.600 --> 11:45.930
I'm gonna do a
little bit of corn,

11:45.970 --> 11:47.970
then I'm gonna make
a chimichurri sauce

11:48.020 --> 11:50.180
- with a hash.
- Wow, that's a lot of stuff.

11:50.230 --> 11:52.520
- You feeling good about where
you are right now? - Yes, chef.

11:52.560 --> 11:54.190
Very, very confident.

11:54.230 --> 11:56.440
My dad had me from day one, as
soon as I was able to walk,

11:56.480 --> 11:59.280
- be able to get on the grill.
- Let's see if it pays off.

11:59.320 --> 12:01.320
I can't wait. I love that. I
love that pressure, chef.

12:01.360 --> 12:03.280
That's why I'm here, is to
try to feel that pressure.

12:03.320 --> 12:05.070
- Good luck.
- Thank you, chef.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.950
35 minutes remaining.
Keep it going.

12:07.990 --> 12:11.120
- How you doing, dorian?
- I'm doing okay, girl.

12:11.160 --> 12:13.460
Working out here on
this grill is crazy.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.620
- Ooh.
-<i> I have sarah on one side,</i>

12:15.670 --> 12:18.960
<i> who's very quiet and very
into what she's doing.</i>

12:19.010 --> 12:22.800
Then I have noah on the other
side, who's very vocal.

12:22.840 --> 12:24.840
- That's dead-on.
-<i> And he's a grill master.</i>

12:24.890 --> 12:27.850
<i> And it seems like
the more he talks,</i>

12:27.890 --> 12:30.210
the worse I feel about
my grilling skills.

12:30.220 --> 12:33.560
But one of the
things that I go by

12:33.600 --> 12:36.400
is never let them see you
sweat, no matter what.

12:36.440 --> 12:39.110
Okay, dorian, you're
doing good, girl.

12:39.150 --> 12:41.030
You got this, girl.

12:42.490 --> 12:44.200
Wuta, you're looking
great over there.

12:44.240 --> 12:47.450
- Right, wuta. How you feeling?
- What's up, chef?

12:47.490 --> 12:49.160
- Pretty good. - Tell me about
the dish. What are you doing?

12:49.200 --> 12:51.160
I have a new york strip
since I'm a new york boy.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.500
- Yep.
- I have a cumin, garlic,

12:52.540 --> 12:54.780
- and lime rub.
- Gotcha.

12:54.790 --> 12:57.630
I'm gonna give a chimichurri,
then I'm doing potato salad.

12:57.670 --> 12:59.420
You gotta have a barbecue,
you gotta have potato salad.

12:59.460 --> 13:02.210
But how do you bounce back? How
do we get back on the track?

13:02.260 --> 13:03.590
Trust me, I already
bounced back.

13:03.630 --> 13:05.510
When was the last time
you ate red meat?

13:05.550 --> 13:07.590
- Eight years ago.
- Who are you gonna depend on

13:07.640 --> 13:09.890
- to make sure that's absolutely perfect
this evening? - I gotta taste it.

13:09.930 --> 13:11.680
I gotta taste it. I'm gonna put
it in my mouth, spit it out.

13:11.720 --> 13:14.180
As long as it tastes good,
I'm gonna be happy.

13:14.230 --> 13:17.230
- Good luck, young man. Think about the
plating, yes? - Thank you. Always.

13:17.270 --> 13:20.060
Wuta: <i> I'm working at a
disadvantage again as a vegetarian,</i>

13:20.110 --> 13:23.820
<i> but being a struggling reader
all throughout middle school,</i>

13:23.860 --> 13:25.950
I never thought I had
the chops in education

13:25.990 --> 13:28.570
to be this teacher that could
teach kids about words

13:28.620 --> 13:30.410
<i> and teach kids about reading.</i>

13:30.450 --> 13:32.660
And now I'm living that dream.

13:32.700 --> 13:35.450
<i> So I'm going to push myself
the same way I pushed myself</i>

13:35.500 --> 13:38.670
<i> in my profession to get
through this challenge.</i>

13:38.710 --> 13:42.170
Lemon, garlic, oil, red peppers.

13:42.210 --> 13:46.420
Whoo! That is hot!

13:46.470 --> 13:48.430
Here we go, guys, focus.
Speed up, please, let's go.

13:48.470 --> 13:50.970
- Yes, chef.
- Shari: Here you go, noah.

13:51.010 --> 13:53.350
- He has a lot of passion.
- Good technique there. Looking good, noah!

13:53.390 --> 13:55.060
Fred: He's gonna kick ass at it.

13:55.100 --> 13:57.690
- All of you look at me. Stop the clock.
- Yes, chef.

13:57.730 --> 14:00.350
Stop the clock! Listen up!

14:00.400 --> 14:02.570
- Season ten.
- Yes, chef.

14:02.610 --> 14:06.110
- Oh, man. - We decided today that
your main course isn't enough.

14:06.150 --> 14:09.860
You've got half an hour left.
We wanna see a dessert.

14:09.910 --> 14:12.610
Are you ( bleep ) kidding me?

14:12.620 --> 14:14.290
Micah: <i>Of course they're gonna
make us do a fricking dessert.</i>

14:14.330 --> 14:16.790
Why wouldn't they
make us do a dessert?

14:16.830 --> 14:20.250
Gordon: That's right. A
delicious, grilled dessert.

14:21.670 --> 14:23.710
If there's any day I
wanted to be safe

14:23.750 --> 14:25.670
from elimination challenge,
this is the day.

14:25.720 --> 14:28.090
Keturah: <i> Oh, my god.</i>

14:28.130 --> 14:29.720
I feel like I'm about
to have a meltdown.

14:29.760 --> 14:31.050
( exhales )

14:40.560 --> 14:42.940
stop the clock. Stop the clock!

14:42.980 --> 14:45.480
Listen up, you got
half an hour left.

14:45.530 --> 14:47.990
We wanna see a dessert!

14:48.030 --> 14:49.990
Are you ( bleep ) kidding me?

14:50.030 --> 14:52.440
That's right. We wanna
see a grilled dessert.

14:52.450 --> 14:54.200
You can do anything you want.

14:54.240 --> 14:55.530
Be smart, don't
overcomplicate it.

14:55.580 --> 14:57.830
The clock starts now!

14:57.870 --> 15:00.120
- Let's go!
- Yes, chef.

15:00.170 --> 15:01.580
Whoa!

15:01.630 --> 15:03.290
Gordon: One portion, guys.

15:03.340 --> 15:04.710
What the hell am I gonna make?

15:04.750 --> 15:06.300
Is there red onions anywhere?

15:06.340 --> 15:09.670
I'm thinking about meat, which
already got me in outer space.

15:09.720 --> 15:12.340
Now I have to come back to
earth and make a dessert?

15:12.390 --> 15:14.220
One stunning, beautiful,
grilled dessert.

15:14.260 --> 15:17.560
I don't eat sweets and my
dad has diabetes, man!

15:17.600 --> 15:19.390
<i> My mom's a health nut nurse.</i>

15:19.440 --> 15:21.640
- ( exhales )
- holy crap, though.

15:21.690 --> 15:23.560
Two dishes now. That's insanity.

15:23.610 --> 15:25.770
AarÃ³n: Stay calm, everybody.

15:25.820 --> 15:27.940
Remember, the steaks can
sear and they can rest.

15:27.990 --> 15:29.610
You can do this, let's go.

15:29.650 --> 15:32.400
I hope I'm able to get
everything done in time.

15:32.450 --> 15:35.570
I mean, I'm definitely feeling
a little bit of the pressure.

15:35.620 --> 15:38.240
But that seems to be
the theme of this--

15:38.290 --> 15:40.370
this year, is pressure.

15:40.410 --> 15:42.870
Man, if you're surprised
by anything--

15:42.920 --> 15:45.700
I'm always expecting maybe,
like, stand on one foot

15:45.710 --> 15:47.630
and do something, sing a song.

15:47.670 --> 15:49.630
I mean, anything goes.
It's season ten.

15:49.670 --> 15:51.880
Season ten, it's gonna push
out the weak people, though,

15:51.930 --> 15:53.880
that can't handle the
heat in the kitchen.

15:53.890 --> 15:55.510
And it's as hot as a son
of a ( bleep ) right now,

15:55.550 --> 15:58.010
so, you know, it is what it is.

15:58.020 --> 16:00.220
All right, guys, here's
the real challenge.

16:00.270 --> 16:02.090
Now you gotta make
a grilled dessert.

16:02.100 --> 16:03.690
- What do you make?
- I'd get some of those peaches

16:03.730 --> 16:06.360
and do a fast-tracked
grilled peach cobbler.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.980
Use the barbecue like an oven.

16:08.020 --> 16:09.780
- Gordon: Exactly that.
- Sounds good. AarÃ³n?

16:09.820 --> 16:10.990
For me, I'm gonna
use that pineapple,

16:11.030 --> 16:13.530
carve it out, grill
the whole thing,

16:13.570 --> 16:16.030
and just make the most
beautiful sort of berry hash,

16:16.080 --> 16:17.660
and maybe just do a quick
little whipped cream

16:17.700 --> 16:19.280
- and just dollop it with that.
- Wow.

16:19.330 --> 16:21.950
- Love you, bye.
- I tta do an elvis classic,

16:22.000 --> 16:24.420
a grilled peanut butter,
banana sandwich.

16:24.460 --> 16:26.880
Drizzle it with a little maple
syrup infused with butter.

16:26.920 --> 16:29.170
- Sandwiched together? Powdered sugar
on top. - Yeah, sandwiched together.

16:29.210 --> 16:31.130
- Yeah.
- I like that idea.

16:31.170 --> 16:34.430
Gordon: Guys, 25 minutes to go.

16:34.470 --> 16:35.930
Fred: What's jamie's dessert?

16:35.970 --> 16:38.430
- Okay, I see peaches.
- I got some peaches halved

16:38.470 --> 16:39.810
in the pan right here
with some brown sugar

16:39.850 --> 16:40.850
and a little bit of water,

16:40.890 --> 16:41.930
get them flambÃ©ed a little bit.

16:41.980 --> 16:43.600
Smelling good, guys.

16:43.640 --> 16:45.690
- Thank you, chef.
- Let's go.

16:47.690 --> 16:50.270
That's smart, dorian.
You got this.

16:50.320 --> 16:52.070
Right, dorian, season ten.

16:52.110 --> 16:54.700
- It's the season of the twist.
- Season ten, chef. Yes.

16:54.740 --> 16:56.410
- Y'all keep doing it. - Come on, do
you think we'd make it easy for you?

16:56.450 --> 16:58.240
- Yeah, I was hoping that you did, chef.
- No chance.

16:58.280 --> 17:00.030
Tell me about the dessert.
What are you doing?

17:00.080 --> 17:04.290
- I am doing a plum french toast.
- I love french toast.

17:04.329 --> 17:06.619
Your passion and determination in
the competition is pretty evident.

17:06.670 --> 17:08.829
- Thank you.
- But how far can you go?

17:08.880 --> 17:10.790
I'm gonna go all the way, chef.
I can't go home unless I win.

17:10.839 --> 17:12.170
Unless you bring
that trophy home.

17:12.210 --> 17:14.339
Unless I bring that
trophy and a check home.

17:14.380 --> 17:15.829
- What would it mean to you if you won?
- It would mean a lot.

17:15.839 --> 17:17.630
It would be
life-changing for me.

17:17.680 --> 17:19.800
Everything that I hear people
saying, I'll start to believe it.

17:19.890 --> 17:21.310
You're absolutely right. Young
lady, you got 20 minutes

17:21.349 --> 17:22.510
- to nail this, yeah?
- Thank you.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.390
- Make it count, yes?
- Thank you.

17:24.440 --> 17:26.140
Dorian: <i> In the past I've
come up against a lot.</i>

17:26.190 --> 17:28.150
I've gone without food.

17:28.190 --> 17:31.980
I've gone without
shelter at times.

17:32.030 --> 17:33.570
<i> But I've been able
to push through it.</i>

17:33.610 --> 17:36.150
<i> And the masterchef kitchen</i>

17:36.200 --> 17:39.410
<i> is like me replaying my
whole life over again,</i>

17:39.450 --> 17:42.160
<i> fighting my way through it,
and I'm not gonna give up</i>

17:42.200 --> 17:44.580
no matter what.

17:47.040 --> 17:49.670
- What's he putting on that kabob?
- It looks like peach

17:49.710 --> 17:50.750
- and strawberry.
- Strawberries.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.960
Joe: I think that's risky.

17:53.010 --> 17:55.590
Like, you think a fruit kabob, yeah, easy.
But not so easy.

17:55.630 --> 17:56.970
AarÃ³n: No.

17:57.010 --> 17:58.680
Had a little snafu yesterday,

17:58.720 --> 18:00.880
so today's the opportunity
to stay right here.

18:00.890 --> 18:02.390
I'm really pressed
for time right now.

18:02.430 --> 18:03.890
Hopefully, I can get
this crÃ¨me fraÃ®che done.

18:03.930 --> 18:06.100
Gonna do what I can.
Hopefully it's enough.

18:06.140 --> 18:08.640
- Looks great, jamie.
- Thank you.

18:10.940 --> 18:12.360
All right, micah,
what do you got?

18:12.400 --> 18:14.230
Grilled peach kabobs.

18:14.280 --> 18:17.240
Yes. So, I did peaches,
plums, and strawberries

18:17.270 --> 18:20.660
with a honey raspberry
dark rum glaze.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.450
- Looks good.
- On the side, I have a honey raspberry

18:22.490 --> 18:24.280
lime dipping sauce.

18:24.330 --> 18:25.790
Micah: <i> My dessert
appears to be simple,</i>

18:25.830 --> 18:27.620
<i> but it's tricky.</i>

18:27.670 --> 18:30.830
It takes a level of finesse
to work with grilled fruits.

18:30.880 --> 18:34.500
If I overcook the strawberries
and undercook the peaches,

18:34.550 --> 18:35.880
it's gonna taste disgusting,

18:35.920 --> 18:37.340
<i> so this has to be perfect.</i>

18:37.380 --> 18:39.090
AarÃ³n: Nice and simple.

18:39.140 --> 18:40.970
- Yes, chef.
- Those look great.

18:41.010 --> 18:44.260
Gordon: 15 minutes to go, guys.
Let's go!

18:44.310 --> 18:45.810
( sighs )

18:45.890 --> 18:47.680
keturah: <i> I am panicking.</i>

18:47.730 --> 18:49.520
<i> I feel like I need
to make something</i>

18:49.560 --> 18:51.560
that ends up being simple,

18:51.610 --> 18:54.520
<i> so I'm going to make a s'more.</i>

18:54.570 --> 18:56.530
I don't even know what that
is, but I've heard it.

18:56.570 --> 18:58.190
<i> I know the ingredients,</i>

18:58.230 --> 19:00.200
but I have no clue
what to do with it.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.410
Oh, ( bleep ).

19:02.450 --> 19:05.200
- Let's go. You good?
- Oh, I don't know what I'm doing.

19:05.240 --> 19:08.450
- What? - I don't know. I don't
know. I don't know how to do it.

19:08.500 --> 19:10.910
Well, you know they go super
quick, so I wouldn't use a grill.

19:10.960 --> 19:12.580
- Look at the flame--
- just the-- okay.

19:12.630 --> 19:13.920
That way you'll get
them nice and coated.

19:13.960 --> 19:16.040
Okay, chef. Thank you.

19:16.090 --> 19:17.170
( bleep )

19:17.210 --> 19:18.210
( groans )

19:18.260 --> 19:19.340
come on, caramel.

19:19.380 --> 19:20.970
Guys, we're down
to seven minutes.

19:21.010 --> 19:23.090
Just under seven minutes to go.

19:23.140 --> 19:25.550
- It's still warm.
- Start thinking about the presentation.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.680
Masterchef worthy--
more importantly,

19:27.730 --> 19:30.600
that dessert needs to
scream the word "grill."

19:30.640 --> 19:32.230
wuta, you're looking
great over there.

19:32.270 --> 19:33.940
I'm feeling pretty good.

19:33.980 --> 19:35.900
I'm kind of getting used
to being in elimination.

19:35.940 --> 19:37.820
If I get my flavor
profiles right,

19:37.860 --> 19:39.570
I think it's gonna
go very well for me.

19:39.610 --> 19:41.110
Smell the sauce. Done.

19:41.160 --> 19:42.150
This sucks.

19:42.200 --> 19:43.270
( bleep )

19:43.280 --> 19:45.660
I'm so pissed, but whatever.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.580
- Micah: Dorian, do you have any mint?
- Yes.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.240
- Can I have some, please?
- No. Psych, I'm just playing.

19:49.290 --> 19:51.450
- ( laughs )
- wow.

19:51.460 --> 19:53.500
I was like, "I thought
we were friends!"

19:53.540 --> 19:54.710
ain't got nothing to
do with being friends

19:54.750 --> 19:56.500
- in the kitchen.
- Amen.

19:56.550 --> 19:58.590
- Shari: Looking really great, noah.
- Thank you.

19:58.630 --> 20:01.550
- I'm feeling great.
- 90 seconds to go, guys.

20:01.590 --> 20:02.800
AarÃ³n: Let's go. Here we go.

20:02.840 --> 20:04.840
( cheers and applause )

20:04.890 --> 20:06.300
you can do it! Sarah, come on!

20:06.350 --> 20:08.510
One stunning dessert,
one beautiful,

20:08.560 --> 20:12.310
- grilled meat entrÃ©e.
- Come on, guys.

20:12.350 --> 20:16.050
( cheers and applause )

20:16.070 --> 20:17.860
whoo, son!

20:17.900 --> 20:19.020
There you go, jamie. Looks good.

20:20.650 --> 20:22.400
AarÃ³n: Come on, wuta.
Make it sing.

20:22.450 --> 20:24.740
60 seconds to go, guys.
Keep it going.

20:24.780 --> 20:27.200
- AarÃ³n: Here we go, come on.
- Finishing touches. Let's go!

20:27.240 --> 20:30.290
It's dead-on with grill
marks, the color is awesome.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.950
There is no second place.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.290
There's first place,
and I need to grab it.

20:33.330 --> 20:35.330
Shari: Come on,
keturah, you got this.

20:35.380 --> 20:37.630
- AarÃ³n: Here we go, final push.
- Come on.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.040
You should be plating
it right now.

20:39.090 --> 20:40.090
Shari: Make it beautiful!

20:40.130 --> 20:41.630
No, I don't want it like that.

20:41.670 --> 20:42.920
Shari: Come on, sarah!

20:42.970 --> 20:45.130
AarÃ³n: Use spoons, everyone.
Finesse.

20:45.180 --> 20:48.930
I want to win this, but I'm
so far behind right now,

20:48.970 --> 20:50.260
<i> I'm kinda freaking
out a little bit.</i>

20:50.310 --> 20:52.060
45 seconds to go.

20:52.100 --> 20:55.140
<i> I waited until the very
last minute to plate,</i>

20:55.190 --> 20:57.100
<i> and now I'm
second-guessing myself.</i>

20:57.150 --> 20:59.400
Remember, dessert on
the side, please.

20:59.440 --> 21:02.280
<i> I have literally seconds
to plate this dish.</i>

21:02.320 --> 21:04.240
I just have to figure it out.

21:04.280 --> 21:05.570
AarÃ³n: Come on,
sarah, you can do it.

21:05.610 --> 21:07.450
Shari: You guys got it, come on.

21:07.490 --> 21:09.450
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.
- Here we go.

21:09.490 --> 21:10.910
( bleep )

21:18.920 --> 21:20.250
- come on, sarah. You can do it.
- Let's go, wuta, come on!

21:20.300 --> 21:21.630
- Let's go, let's go!
- ( bleep )

21:21.670 --> 21:25.300
all: Ten, nine, eight, seven,

21:25.340 --> 21:27.800
six, five, four,

21:27.850 --> 21:30.220
three, two, one.

21:30.260 --> 21:31.640
And stop. Hands in the air.

21:31.680 --> 21:34.550
- Great job, guys.
- Gordon: Well done.

21:34.560 --> 21:37.600
Amazing. Good job.

21:37.650 --> 21:40.110
This was a tough one.
This was not easy.

21:40.150 --> 21:41.770
Aww, man, I'm feeling
pretty good.

21:41.820 --> 21:43.570
<i> It's a rustic plate,
but I think this is--</i>

21:43.610 --> 21:45.820
this would be an $85,
$95 plate at home.

21:45.860 --> 21:50.240
No, I'm not feeling confident.
We'll see what happens.

21:50.280 --> 21:52.280
First of all, can I
just say the energy,

21:52.330 --> 21:53.490
what you put into that-- exceptional.
Well done.

21:53.540 --> 21:54.620
Give yourselves a
round of applause.

21:54.660 --> 21:56.830
Thank you, chef. Good job, guys.

21:56.870 --> 22:02.040
But it is elimination. Sadly,
somebody's going home.

22:02.090 --> 22:03.920
- Dorian, please, let's go.
- Noah: Let's go, dorian.

22:03.960 --> 22:05.920
- Come on, dorian.
- You got it, dorian.

22:05.970 --> 22:08.720
I think the judges are
going to love the plating.

22:08.760 --> 22:10.720
<i> I'm just really concerned
about my steak.</i>

22:10.760 --> 22:13.350
I don't have any experience
with beef on the grill.

22:13.390 --> 22:15.970
<i> But I'm glad that I get the
opportunity to show them</i>

22:16.020 --> 22:17.680
that no matter what
the challenge is,

22:17.730 --> 22:19.100
<i> I'm able to overcome it.</i>

22:19.150 --> 22:20.190
Describe the dish, please.

22:20.230 --> 22:22.480
I have a t-bone steak

22:22.520 --> 22:25.980
with a sweet potato purÃ©e and
blistered grilled tomatoes

22:26.030 --> 22:27.570
with roasted garlic.

22:27.610 --> 22:29.030
Visually, it looks delicious.

22:29.070 --> 22:31.110
Also, one of the most
difficult to pull off.

22:31.160 --> 22:32.410
Why with the t-bone? Because
you got the fillet,

22:32.450 --> 22:34.660
the tiny, little, sort
of rolls royce cut,

22:34.700 --> 22:37.620
then you got the big,
incredible new york strip.

22:37.660 --> 22:40.330
I think for me, I
just love the fact

22:40.380 --> 22:42.330
that you were able to
harness in your creativity

22:42.380 --> 22:44.040
from a visual standpoint.

22:44.090 --> 22:45.170
Roasted tomatoes look beautiful.

22:45.210 --> 22:46.300
They don't look like
they're hammered over.

22:46.340 --> 22:47.710
And then you kind
of bring it back

22:47.760 --> 22:49.630
with the sophistication
of the silky purÃ©e.

22:49.680 --> 22:51.340
- Very well thought out.
- Thank you, chef.

22:51.390 --> 22:53.180
Hopefully, the steak is right.

22:53.220 --> 22:56.460
Shall we? How should we
expect the meat to be?

22:56.480 --> 22:58.680
I am praying to everything

22:58.730 --> 23:01.480
that's mary and holy
that it's medium rare.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.030
- Gordon: Beautiful.
- Joe: Perfect.

23:07.070 --> 23:08.770
Gordon: That's medium rare.

23:08.780 --> 23:10.650
- Joe: Wow.
- So we expect a fillet

23:10.700 --> 23:12.990
to be a little bit closer
in terms of medium.

23:13.030 --> 23:17.160
And, in fact, that's
also perfect.

23:17.200 --> 23:20.250
- How'd you manage that?
- I have no idea. God.

23:21.710 --> 23:23.960
For me, it's cooked perfectly.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Little bit too much
spice in the purÃ©e.

23:26.050 --> 23:28.590
- Okay.
- The flavor of the cook is just spot-on.

23:28.630 --> 23:29.670
You can't deny that.

23:29.720 --> 23:32.430
Maybe a harder sear
on the outside,

23:32.470 --> 23:35.390
- but I just love the simplicity and it
delivers on flavor. - Thank you, chef.

23:35.430 --> 23:37.850
So, miss dorian, can you
explain your dessert, please?

23:37.890 --> 23:40.060
I have a brioche french toast

23:40.100 --> 23:43.560
with a grilled plum
and bourbon compote,

23:43.610 --> 23:45.230
and, um, sweet cream.

23:52.160 --> 23:53.780
It's delicious.

23:53.780 --> 23:55.950
I love the acidity,
the creaminess.

23:55.990 --> 23:57.940
I'm amazed you got a dessertous.

23:57.950 --> 23:59.830
That refined in such a
short period of time.

23:59.870 --> 24:02.370
That's the difference
between you

24:02.420 --> 24:04.250
and a lot of them
standing behind you,

24:04.290 --> 24:06.540
- you don't take things easy.
- Thank you, chef.

24:06.590 --> 24:08.590
You bring home cooking to another level.
Good job.

24:08.630 --> 24:10.510
- Thank you, joe. Thank you.
- Gordon: Great job, well done.

24:10.550 --> 24:14.930
- Great job.
- Whoo, dorian!

24:14.970 --> 24:16.800
Keturah: Those are the
kind of tears I wanna see.

24:16.850 --> 24:20.390
Tears of joy. Well done.

24:20.430 --> 24:22.520
Jamie, please bring
your steak down.

24:22.560 --> 24:24.520
- Whoo!
- Jamie!

24:24.560 --> 24:26.150
I'm walking up to the
judges with confidence.

24:26.190 --> 24:27.770
<i> I know my steak is perfect.</i>

24:27.820 --> 24:31.570
<i> Anchovy butter is a hard
one not to like on a steak.</i>

24:31.610 --> 24:33.400
<i> This is my chance
to redeem myself.</i>

24:34.780 --> 24:35.990
Gordon: Describe the
dish please, jamie.

24:36.030 --> 24:38.490
So, I went with the
tomahawk rib eye

24:38.540 --> 24:40.330
and I topped it with some
garlic anchovy butter.

24:40.370 --> 24:42.990
I did some duck fat
fried broccolini

24:43.000 --> 24:44.370
with shaved fingerling potatoes

24:44.420 --> 24:47.380
and a southern style
spicy creamed corn.

24:47.420 --> 24:50.460
Looks like a properly styled
cover of a food magazine.

24:50.510 --> 24:52.460
It's certainly contemporary
with the aesthetic.

24:52.510 --> 24:53.920
The crust on the steak
looks fantastic.

24:53.970 --> 24:55.510
- Can't wait to try it.
- Thank you.

24:55.550 --> 24:57.390
Tell me about the cook.
What are we looking for?

24:57.430 --> 24:59.800
I tried to take it to a perfect
medium rare for you guys.

24:59.850 --> 25:01.100
That's good news for us.

25:02.310 --> 25:04.020
So, let's see.

25:07.060 --> 25:08.860
- AarÃ³n: Gorgeous.
- Beautiful.

25:08.900 --> 25:12.730
Joe: Yeah, it's like a
perfect medium rare.

25:12.780 --> 25:15.150
- Very nice.
- Good job, jamie.

25:15.200 --> 25:16.450
Great job!

25:16.490 --> 25:17.910
- Steak's cooked beautifully.
- Thank you.

25:17.950 --> 25:19.950
Corn, delicious. The one
downside to this dish

25:19.990 --> 25:22.700
is when you sautÃ© that
broccolini in duck fat,

25:22.750 --> 25:24.620
- it needs to be sparse.
- Okay.

25:24.670 --> 25:26.290
Because it gets you straight
back to there and there.

25:26.330 --> 25:28.960
- We got fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat.
- Okay.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.960
But I think you got a strong message
to send everybody in this competition

25:31.000 --> 25:32.840
based on the screw up
with the lobsters.

25:32.880 --> 25:35.630
And I wish you continue taking
your frustration out on food,

25:35.680 --> 25:37.220
- because it's fireworks.
- Thank you.

25:37.260 --> 25:39.220
- Really great.- Thank .

25:40.760 --> 25:42.810
Describe the desserts, please.

25:42.850 --> 25:44.420
Smoked peaches, and topped
them with crÃ¨me fraÃ®che.

25:44.430 --> 25:46.480
Did you deglaze with
bourbon or any--

25:46.520 --> 25:48.510
oh, I did. I did glaze the
pan with some dark rum

25:48.520 --> 25:51.360
and actually flambÃ©ed the dish.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.360
Yeah, it's like a
caramel peach dessert.

25:53.400 --> 25:55.860
And I can close my eyes
and taste the grill.

25:55.900 --> 25:57.740
- Thank you.
- I love the juiciness of the peaches.

25:57.780 --> 25:59.360
They mimic the steak.

25:59.410 --> 26:01.410
- Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you, chef.
- Very good.

26:01.450 --> 26:04.040
- Thank you.
- Awesome. Thanks, guys.

26:04.080 --> 26:06.250
Thank you.

26:08.710 --> 26:10.380
Next up, wuta, please.
Thank you.

26:10.420 --> 26:12.790
( cheering )

26:12.840 --> 26:15.260
wuta: <i> I look at my dishes,
and they're kind of messy.</i>

26:15.300 --> 26:17.670
But barbecue food is
always kind of messy.

26:17.720 --> 26:18.970
Gordon: Thank you.

26:21.310 --> 26:22.100
Describe the dish
for me, please.

26:22.140 --> 26:25.140
So I have a new york strip

26:25.180 --> 26:26.850
with roasted red
pepper chimichurri.

26:26.890 --> 26:29.100
I have a potato
salad with bacon,

26:29.150 --> 26:32.480
and some charred, grilled
corn with rosemary butter.

26:32.520 --> 26:34.690
Wuta, I'm gonna be very honest.
This does not look appealing.

26:34.740 --> 26:37.530
There's a lot of
dark muted colors

26:37.570 --> 26:40.160
that it's kind of
rough to get over.

26:40.200 --> 26:42.200
You're a vegetarian.

26:42.240 --> 26:43.910
You haven't eaten
meat in a decade.

26:43.950 --> 26:45.580
How is this gonna be cooked?

26:45.620 --> 26:48.040
I think it's a
medium-- medium rare.

26:48.080 --> 26:49.710
Let's try it out.

26:52.920 --> 26:54.590
Gordon: Oh, boy.

27:04.430 --> 27:06.430
Let's try it out.

27:10.440 --> 27:13.940
- Oh, boy.
- Yeah, it's a definite medium,

27:13.980 --> 27:16.400
but the problems begin there.

27:16.430 --> 27:19.360
Gordon: Wuta, this isn't
a new york strip.

27:19.400 --> 27:21.200
Trust me. This is
a hanger steak.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.070
Yeah, it's not a-- it's
not a new york strip.

27:23.120 --> 27:24.660
- These grains underneath there.
- Yeah.

27:24.700 --> 27:26.450
Look at the way the grains run.

27:27.410 --> 27:31.290
I think I just made a mistake.

27:31.330 --> 27:33.630
Gordon: Well, if there's one
thing, this steak is so fibrous,

27:33.670 --> 27:35.340
it literally needs
to be undercooked.

27:35.380 --> 27:36.840
It's such a difficult
one to get right.

27:42.260 --> 27:44.300
It's overcooked.

27:44.350 --> 27:45.970
And there's some issues with
all the other elements.

27:46.010 --> 27:48.260
This isn't really a chimichurri.

27:48.310 --> 27:50.600
A chimichurri is more of a loose
vinaigrette with chopped herbs, not purÃ©e.

27:50.640 --> 27:53.810
But I do like the seasoning,
personally, on the steak, wuta.

27:53.860 --> 27:55.150
There is some
saving grace there.

27:58.320 --> 27:59.530
And describe the
dessert, please.

27:59.570 --> 28:02.700
For dessert, we have
a take on a s'more.

28:02.740 --> 28:06.780
I put bananas in the dark chocolate
and roasted the marshmallows.

28:06.830 --> 28:08.660
- You actually grilled the shortbread?
- Yes.

28:11.290 --> 28:14.580
- Actually, quite good.
- The chocolate's gone a little bit grainy.

28:14.630 --> 28:16.290
That's what happens when you
just put chocolate in a pan.

28:16.340 --> 28:17.710
Chocolate's chemistry--

28:17.750 --> 28:19.210
you can't just stick
it in a frying pan

28:19.260 --> 28:20.510
- and throw bananas in there.
- AarÃ³n: It's bizarre.

28:20.550 --> 28:22.000
No, it's not bizarre, it's good.

28:22.010 --> 28:23.630
He actually put the
shortbread on the grill.

28:23.680 --> 28:25.390
I mean, it has a
grill sense to it.

28:25.430 --> 28:27.600
- I think it's successful.
- It's a little dry.

28:27.640 --> 28:29.390
- Well...
- Well, I like it.

28:29.430 --> 28:31.220
- Gordon: Thank you, wuta.
- Joe: Thank you.

28:31.270 --> 28:32.310
Thank you, gentlemen.

28:34.270 --> 28:36.690
I cooked the wrong meat.

28:36.730 --> 28:39.900
<i> Not only that, but I'm coming
off of a team challenge</i>

28:39.940 --> 28:42.570
<i> that as a team leader, I lost.</i>

28:42.610 --> 28:43.820
<i> It doesn't feel great.</i>

28:43.860 --> 28:44.860
This is crushing.

28:46.580 --> 28:48.660
Miss sarah, can you please
bring up your dish?

28:48.700 --> 28:50.870
- Let's go, sarah.
- Whoo, sarah!

28:50.910 --> 28:52.160
- Great job.
- Go, sarah!

28:52.210 --> 28:54.780
- That is huge.
- You go, girl.

28:54.790 --> 28:56.040
- Looks great.
- Beautiful.

28:56.080 --> 28:57.630
Bri: Awesome.

28:59.090 --> 29:01.340
Presentation is breathtaking.

29:01.380 --> 29:04.340
That would turn heads tonight in
any restaurant across america.

29:04.380 --> 29:06.220
- Thank you, chef.
- Describe the dish, please.

29:06.260 --> 29:08.640
Today I have for you
a tomahawk steak

29:08.680 --> 29:11.310
with brussels sprouts,
bacon lardons,

29:11.350 --> 29:15.270
and a little bit of crisp green
apple with a sweet potato purÃ©e.

29:15.310 --> 29:17.060
You think it's a
perfect medium rare?

29:17.110 --> 29:19.730
- It should be, joe.
- Yeah, let's see.

29:21.190 --> 29:24.650
What do you think, guys?
That is perfection.

29:24.700 --> 29:26.700
- Renee: Good job!
- Wow.

29:26.740 --> 29:29.700
AarÃ³n: Man! That's the stuff you
see in the textbooks right there.

29:29.740 --> 29:32.120
- Thank you so much.
- Wow.

29:32.160 --> 29:34.660
Oh, my god. For me, delicious.

29:34.710 --> 29:36.370
PurÃ©e, fantastic. Fried sprouts.

29:36.420 --> 29:38.540
You just need a perfect glass of wine.
Great job.

29:38.590 --> 29:41.630
- Thank you so much.
- You cooked and seasoned that

29:41.670 --> 29:44.920
like a fat, tattooed,
bald, bearded,

29:44.970 --> 29:46.590
new york city
steakhouse grill man.

29:46.640 --> 29:49.390
- Thank you, joe.
- And I know several.

29:49.430 --> 29:51.850
That's what I was going for.

29:51.890 --> 29:53.220
Gordon: Great job. Describe
the dessert, please.

29:53.270 --> 29:57.310
This is my rustic grilled
version of a blackberry pie.

29:57.350 --> 29:59.480
I cooked down some blackberries
with a little sugar,

29:59.520 --> 30:02.400
put filo dough on top, and
made a caramel sauce.

30:02.440 --> 30:04.390
- Looks good.
- How'd you get the color on that filo?

30:04.400 --> 30:07.320
I put a little bit of
butter all over it,

30:07.360 --> 30:09.160
and then I put it on the
top rack of the grill

30:09.200 --> 30:12.570
and cooked it closed
with the heat on high.

30:12.580 --> 30:15.080
- Mmm.
- Gordon: It's delicious.

30:15.120 --> 30:16.450
Maybe a little bit of
balsamic vinegar in there.

30:16.500 --> 30:17.750
But the fact that you've managed

30:17.790 --> 30:20.420
to cook that the way
you have in the grill,

30:20.460 --> 30:21.630
I'm glad you went all out
to be that adventurous.

30:21.670 --> 30:24.870
- Well done.
- Thank you. Good job.

30:24.880 --> 30:26.800
Sarah: <i> Oh, my god,
this is incredible.</i>

30:26.840 --> 30:29.630
<i> I learned how to grill
before I learned how to cook,</i>

30:29.680 --> 30:30.970
so I am on cloud nine right now.

30:32.640 --> 30:34.680
Micah, please bring
up your steak dish.

30:34.720 --> 30:37.310
- Let's go, micah!
- Let's go, micah!

30:37.350 --> 30:38.350
Jamie: Looks good, buddy.

30:40.560 --> 30:42.310
Describe the dish please, micah.

30:42.360 --> 30:45.570
I have a barbecue rubbed t-bone
with charred lemon broccolini

30:45.610 --> 30:49.030
and a smokehouse
sweet potato purÃ©e.

30:49.070 --> 30:50.990
So, visually, you got a
great char on there.

30:51.030 --> 30:53.530
- Are you certain it's cooked beautifully?
- I believe so, chef.

30:53.580 --> 30:56.120
- Joe: How is the steak supposed
to be cooked? - Medium rare, chef.

30:56.160 --> 30:58.500
Let's see what we got here.

31:00.960 --> 31:01.830
- Perfect.
- AarÃ³n: Perfect.

31:01.880 --> 31:02.880
Joe: Perfection.

31:02.920 --> 31:06.710
Cooked beautifully. Well done.

31:06.760 --> 31:08.760
The steak's delicious. The
purÃ©e's a little bit grainy.

31:08.800 --> 31:11.680
If you could grill the potatoes on
there, leave them grilled on there.

31:11.720 --> 31:14.100
For me, I just love your rub.
I want more of it,

31:14.140 --> 31:15.810
red chili and all the spice

31:15.850 --> 31:17.560
- that's emanating from that.
- Thank you, chef.

31:17.600 --> 31:18.930
Micah, please describe
your dessert.

31:18.980 --> 31:21.770
I have a summer fruit skewer

31:21.810 --> 31:24.730
grilled with plums,
strawberries, and peaches

31:24.770 --> 31:26.980
and a raspberry
lime dipping sauce.

31:27.030 --> 31:28.860
Now, you're comfortable that
the strawberries will cook

31:28.900 --> 31:30.390
at the same time
that something dense

31:30.410 --> 31:32.990
and meaty like a
peach would cook?

31:33.030 --> 31:35.780
No, that's why I ended up
taking them off the skewer

31:35.830 --> 31:38.160
- and grilling them differently.
- Smart.

31:38.200 --> 31:41.250
I mean, it's so simple,
yet so elegant.

31:46.050 --> 31:50.420
- Delicious. - You were the
only one that using the grill

31:50.470 --> 31:52.800
was able to caramelize the
natural sugar of the fruit,

31:52.840 --> 31:56.100
which is something that's very difficult
to do without burning it. Bravo.

31:56.140 --> 31:58.100
- AarÃ³n: Really great.
- Gordon: Dessert of the day so far.

31:58.140 --> 31:59.890
- Great job.
- Thank you, joe. Thank you, chefs.

31:59.940 --> 32:03.190
Shari: Great job, micah!
Way to go, micah.

32:06.320 --> 32:10.650
- Keturah, please bring up your dish.
- I'm apprehensive.

32:10.700 --> 32:15.160
I know it's not my finest work,
but it took everything in me

32:15.200 --> 32:18.280
-<i> to just complete my dish.</i>
- Describe the dish, please.

32:18.330 --> 32:22.660
This is a take on <i> ensalada
voce</i> and steak frites

32:22.710 --> 32:24.580
with a spicy ketchup.

32:24.630 --> 32:26.670
- What steak did you use?
- I used the tomahawk.

32:26.710 --> 32:29.960
The intention of serving that
rare, was that purposely done?

32:30.010 --> 32:32.170
I thought that it was
supposed to be medium rare.

32:32.220 --> 32:35.960
- Except that's not medium rare.
- That's rare.

32:35.970 --> 32:39.100
- Joe: Should we try? - Gordon: The
salad, give us an insight into the salad.

32:39.140 --> 32:43.060
- What have you done there?
- Lettuce, micro greens, mint, parsley,

32:43.100 --> 32:46.480
walnuts, apple, and some
apple cider vinaigrette.

32:48.730 --> 32:51.030
The meat-- you've got flavor.
The seasoning is in there.

32:51.070 --> 32:53.030
- The ketchup's delicious.
- Thank you.

32:53.070 --> 32:54.950
Salad, you know, it's a little
bit sort of plain jane.

32:54.990 --> 32:56.440
I expect more than
a salad from you.

32:56.450 --> 32:58.780
Yeah, for me, you know,
you said tomahawk...

32:58.830 --> 33:00.950
- Yes. - ...And I'm
looking for the hawk

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
in the tomahawk, and I'm just--

33:03.040 --> 33:06.330
I'm puzzled and perplexed why
you chose to slice that.

33:06.380 --> 33:09.590
Show us the bone. Give
us some reference there.

33:09.630 --> 33:11.130
Yeah, I'm gonna be a
little bit harder.

33:11.170 --> 33:13.300
This is like a tomahawk
massacre to me.

33:14.220 --> 33:15.630
Jeez.

33:15.680 --> 33:17.050
It's just kind of
all over the place.

33:17.100 --> 33:20.560
- Okay. Thank you.
- Fred: Oh, my god.

33:20.600 --> 33:23.560
All right, so tell us about this dessert.
What is it?

33:23.600 --> 33:26.310
This is a take on a s'more

33:26.350 --> 33:29.150
with a vanilla and maple
glazed grilled peach.

33:29.180 --> 33:30.820
How did you cook it?
In the barbecue?

33:30.860 --> 33:33.990
I toasted the marshmallow
itself on an open flame

33:34.030 --> 33:37.030
and then I melted down the dark
chocolate, poured that on top,

33:37.070 --> 33:40.320
and then I grilled the
peach with vanilla.

33:46.250 --> 33:49.660
For me, it's a dessert
that riddles panicked.

33:49.670 --> 33:52.710
I look at that and it's--

33:52.760 --> 33:56.130
it reminds me of season
one "masterchef junior."

33:56.180 --> 33:57.880
whoa.

33:57.890 --> 33:59.550
- Thank you.
- It's all right, keturah.

33:59.600 --> 34:01.100
- Head up, head up.
- It's all right.

34:04.480 --> 34:06.640
Thank you, babe.

34:06.690 --> 34:07.850
Noah, let's go, please.

34:07.900 --> 34:09.980
- Yes, chef.
- Gordon: Bring it up.

34:10.020 --> 34:14.320
I feel very confident that I
nailed and executed all aspects.

34:14.360 --> 34:16.280
<i> I'm here to really
expand the boundaries</i>

34:16.320 --> 34:18.199
<i> of what a steak dish can be.</i>

34:18.239 --> 34:19.659
<i> I mean, we're talking
about getting our recipe</i>

34:19.699 --> 34:22.080
<i> on a national website.</i>

34:22.120 --> 34:24.370
- I mean, we ain't playing games.
- Describe the dish, please.

34:24.409 --> 34:26.530
All right, the star of the show

34:26.540 --> 34:28.580
is the encrusted bone-in chicago
rib eye cooked medium rare.

34:28.630 --> 34:31.170
You have a homemade romesco
sauce, a homemade chimichurri,

34:31.210 --> 34:34.300
and it's stacked all on top
of a southern brussels sprout

34:34.340 --> 34:36.920
confited potato and bacon
and asparagus salad.

34:36.969 --> 34:39.510
- Fantastic. - So, first off,
visually, it looks beautiful.

34:39.550 --> 34:41.510
- Thank you, chef.
- Let's get that right. I love the fact

34:41.550 --> 34:43.810
that you've already
identified medium rare.

34:43.850 --> 34:45.770
- Because that's the way to eat a
bone-in rib eye. - Absolutely, chef.

34:45.810 --> 34:48.429
Watching you on the grill was
like watching a drummer.

34:48.480 --> 34:49.690
- Thank you.
- Phil collins standing there,

34:49.730 --> 34:52.230
literally, eyes closed--
just incredible.

34:52.270 --> 34:54.570
Let's give it a-- let's
give it a whirl.

34:54.610 --> 34:56.440
- Enjoy. Bon appÃ©tit.
- Shall we? All right.

34:56.489 --> 34:58.400
Taking the sunglasses
off for this.

34:58.450 --> 34:59.320
Yeah, you gotta.

35:01.120 --> 35:03.200
- It smells delicious.
- Thank you so much, chef.

35:03.240 --> 35:05.540
- Joe: The moment of truth. You ready?
- Yes, chef.

35:08.410 --> 35:11.000
- Oh, boy.
- Damn.

35:23.010 --> 35:24.890
- Joe: The moment of truth. You ready?
- Yes, chef.

35:26.060 --> 35:27.270
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, boy.

35:27.310 --> 35:28.520
AarÃ³n: Ooh, that's
a little over.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.770
It's like a medium well.
What happened?

35:30.810 --> 35:33.440
- Medium. Overcooked it.
- No, no, that's a medium well, buddy.

35:34.860 --> 35:36.230
Oh, noah.

35:36.280 --> 35:38.110
- Of all days.
- Yes, chef.

35:40.610 --> 35:42.650
So the fragrance of
the rub is delicious.

35:42.660 --> 35:44.530
I love the confited
potatoes, I love the corn,

35:44.580 --> 35:46.280
what you've done-- the romesco.

35:46.330 --> 35:48.700
The saddest news, and
the shock for me

35:48.750 --> 35:51.290
- on a day like today, you've
overcooked the meat. - Yes, chef.

35:51.330 --> 35:54.830
You seemed very confident.
You were overconfident.

35:54.920 --> 35:57.000
- Describe the dessert, please.
- We have a southern classic.

35:57.050 --> 35:58.380
We have a peach melba

35:58.420 --> 35:59.880
with a peach melba
raspberry cream

35:59.920 --> 36:01.340
with a little bit of lemon zest.

36:01.380 --> 36:03.430
- Any marinade on the peach?
- I shocked them

36:03.470 --> 36:05.760
with a little bit of honey,
a little bit of bourbon.

36:05.810 --> 36:09.100
Then I put them on the grill so
they had a real round flavor.

36:09.140 --> 36:11.300
- So, the flavor's there.
- Very nice.

36:11.310 --> 36:12.730
The peaches still a
little too tough.

36:12.770 --> 36:14.650
- Joe: Yeah.
- Too tough.

36:14.690 --> 36:16.480
Yeah, your peaches are
perfectly medium rare.

36:16.520 --> 36:18.320
Your steak was
perfectly medium well.

36:18.360 --> 36:20.110
It's too bad it wasn't
the other way around.

36:20.150 --> 36:21.490
- Yes, joe.
- Gordon: Thank you.

36:21.530 --> 36:24.700
- Thank y'all.
- Damn, what a shame.

36:24.740 --> 36:28.240
For the first time on this
competition, I feel embarrassed.

36:28.290 --> 36:31.410
<i> I came into this competition
with everyone saying</i>

36:31.460 --> 36:33.160
<i> that I'm the number
one guy on a grill,</i>

36:33.210 --> 36:34.580
and I look like a fraud.

36:35.920 --> 36:37.540
That was a tough challenge.

36:37.590 --> 36:40.000
We need a moment right
now to deliberate.

36:40.010 --> 36:42.510
Excuse us, please.

36:42.550 --> 36:44.260
The hero was the meat, right?

36:44.300 --> 36:46.010
And we have got some
outstanding meat there.

36:46.050 --> 36:47.350
- Yeah, we have some--
- sarah was extraordinary.

36:47.390 --> 36:49.850
- Yeah.
- I think jamie nailed that.

36:49.890 --> 36:51.890
Dorian also had some
bright spots as well.

36:51.940 --> 36:53.180
Gordon: Yeah, I was
impressed with that.

36:53.230 --> 36:54.850
- Yeah.
- A disappointing few, though.

36:54.900 --> 36:57.100
- Gordon: Tough.
- AarÃ³n: Yeah.

36:57.150 --> 36:59.570
- And, noah, what a shock.
- I know.

36:59.610 --> 37:02.150
That's what happens when you try
to be too much of a cowboy.

37:02.200 --> 37:04.150
- Oh, jeez.
- Gordon: Yeah.

37:04.200 --> 37:05.570
- Are we good?
- Absolutely.

37:11.870 --> 37:13.910
Gordon: Dorian, you
presented a dish earlier

37:13.960 --> 37:15.620
that was restaurant
quality, it showed finesse,

37:15.670 --> 37:18.210
but more importantly,
it was you on a board.

37:18.250 --> 37:21.800
Young lady, you're
not going home.

37:21.840 --> 37:24.340
Congratulations.
Head up over there.

37:24.380 --> 37:25.880
Fred: Good job, dorian.

37:29.010 --> 37:30.720
The next cook's dish
looked phenomenal--

37:30.770 --> 37:34.060
just really impressed on
the cook of the tomahawk,

37:34.100 --> 37:36.390
and that person is jamie.

37:36.440 --> 37:38.480
- Yeah, jamie!
- Thank you, guys. Appreciate y'all.

37:38.520 --> 37:40.520
- Good job, jamie.
- Way to go, jamie.

37:40.570 --> 37:42.280
Jamie: <i> It's a great feeling
I'm not going home today.</i>

37:42.320 --> 37:44.940
My bags are already
packed after yesterday,

37:44.990 --> 37:46.150
because during
fishing tournaments,

37:46.200 --> 37:47.570
if you don't do
well the first day,

37:47.620 --> 37:49.610
<i> you pack your bag just in case.</i>

37:49.620 --> 37:52.120
So, luckily, tonight I
get to unpack them.

37:52.160 --> 37:57.040
Okay, so the next cook cooked
a perfect medium rare steak

37:57.080 --> 37:59.080
and then they went on to execute

37:59.130 --> 38:02.630
probably the most difficult
dessert of the evening.

38:02.670 --> 38:04.670
And that home cook is...

38:07.050 --> 38:08.840
Micah, you're safe.

38:08.890 --> 38:10.340
- Yeah, micah!
- Thank you.

38:10.390 --> 38:12.100
- Way to go, micah.
- Noah: Good job, micah.

38:12.140 --> 38:14.060
Proud of you, micah.

38:14.100 --> 38:16.680
- Both: Good job.
- Wow.

38:16.730 --> 38:18.980
Only one of these home cooks

38:19.020 --> 38:20.230
is gonna have their
recipe featured...

38:20.270 --> 38:22.390
- Sarah.
- Sarah!

38:22.400 --> 38:24.190
...On the "beef-- it's
what's for dinner" website

38:24.240 --> 38:27.450
and that home cook is sarah.

38:27.490 --> 38:31.780
- ( cheering )
- congratulations, sarah.

38:31.830 --> 38:33.620
Thank you so much.

38:33.660 --> 38:35.490
Please join your colleagues
up there on the balcony.

38:35.540 --> 38:37.000
Good job, sarah.

38:37.040 --> 38:38.780
- Good job.
- Great job.

38:38.790 --> 38:41.130
Sarah: <i> This is so amazing.</i>

38:41.170 --> 38:46.340
I get to have my backyard
but elevated recipe

38:46.380 --> 38:47.670
on this beef website,

38:47.720 --> 38:49.430
and it's a tomahawk steak.

38:49.470 --> 38:51.550
I mean, come on, I'm
a military girl.

38:51.600 --> 38:54.180
If there's any steak
I want featured,

38:54.220 --> 38:55.930
<i> it's a tomahawk steak.</i>

38:55.980 --> 38:59.260
Okay, noah, keturah, and wuta,

38:59.270 --> 39:01.060
please, all three of
you, head to the back.

39:01.110 --> 39:03.060
- Thank you.
- Yes, chef.

39:03.110 --> 39:04.860
Wuta: <i> I'm in the bottom
three yet again,</i>

39:04.900 --> 39:07.940
and I'm just hoping,
I'm praying,

39:07.990 --> 39:10.570
that this isn't going to be
the dish that sends me home.

39:10.620 --> 39:13.320
Now, sadly, keturah,
noah, and wuta,

39:13.370 --> 39:15.650
at least one of you is leaving
the masterchef kitchen.

39:15.660 --> 39:20.120
And let's be honest, across the
board, none of you excelled.

39:20.170 --> 39:24.170
Keturah, you may not have cooked
on the grill a thousand times,

39:24.210 --> 39:27.380
but that was not
masterchef worthy.

39:27.420 --> 39:30.760
Noah, you know, we love bravado.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.640
We try to get confidence out,
but then there's a chance

39:32.680 --> 39:36.430
- of overstepping that mark.
- Yes, chef.

39:36.470 --> 39:39.730
Wuta, young man, you're an
asset to this competition,

39:39.770 --> 39:43.060
but what you put on
the plate was subpar.

39:43.110 --> 39:46.610
Joe, aarÃ³n, and myself,
came to a consensus,

39:46.650 --> 39:50.690
and there is one dish that
is outstandingly bad.

39:50.740 --> 39:54.570
The person leaving
"masterchef" is...

39:59.250 --> 40:00.200
Keturah.

40:02.210 --> 40:04.040
Thank you.

40:04.090 --> 40:06.500
- Thank you.
- Noah and wuta,

40:06.550 --> 40:08.870
- make your way to the balcony, please.
- Noah: Thank you, chef.

40:08.880 --> 40:10.670
Noah: <i> It's a humility
check for me.</i>

40:10.720 --> 40:12.680
I was uberly confident
on the grill

40:12.720 --> 40:14.470
<i> and I got cocky,
and it caught me.</i>

40:14.510 --> 40:17.090
It's okay. Use it as a
learning experience.

40:17.100 --> 40:18.720
Keturah, unfortunately,
the dish was lackluster,

40:18.770 --> 40:20.390
and we felt that you--

40:20.440 --> 40:22.690
you gave up.

40:22.730 --> 40:25.350
I'm sorry, your journey has come
to an end in this competition.

40:25.400 --> 40:26.860
This is a tough moment
for me right now.

40:26.900 --> 40:28.110
This is something that I wanted,

40:28.150 --> 40:29.980
so I'm a bit sad.

40:30.030 --> 40:31.610
You've done very well. You
should be very proud.

40:31.650 --> 40:33.490
Thank you very much.
I appreciate that.

40:33.530 --> 40:35.820
Keturah, please, place
your apron onto your bench

40:35.870 --> 40:38.200
- and have a safe trip home.
- Thank you!

40:38.240 --> 40:42.460
- Good job, keturah.
- Thank you, ladies. Thank you, sirs.

40:42.500 --> 40:46.130
Keturah: <i> There is a passion
for food that burns within me,</i>

40:46.170 --> 40:50.050
and it sucks to not be a part
of the competition anymore.

40:51.550 --> 40:54.930
<i> But, you know, I've
gotten hands-on tuition</i>

40:54.970 --> 40:57.800
by some world renowned
chefs and restaurateurs,

40:57.850 --> 41:01.560
so, it's-- it's bittersweet.

41:01.600 --> 41:03.310
- Bye, keturah!
- Good luck!
