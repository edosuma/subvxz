[ siren wailing]

00:36.826 --> 00:38.619
A hush comes over the crowd.

00:38.689 --> 00:41.551
The only sound is Bender
calling everyone else

00:41.619 --> 00:42.930
a jerk as he swings!

00:44.517 --> 00:47.206
Aw, he slices
into the water!

00:47.274 --> 00:48.310
Oh, man!

00:48.378 --> 00:50.965
[ angry muttering]

00:51.033 --> 00:54.000
Boy, I'll tell you, man...

00:55.930 --> 00:58.171
Bad news, everyone.

00:58.240 --> 01:01.067
You're not good enough
to go on your next mission.

01:01.137 --> 01:03.448
Hooray!Not good enough!

01:03.517 --> 01:04.757
Why? Says who?

01:04.826 --> 01:06.412
Because. And says me.

01:06.481 --> 01:09.034
It's an extremely
dangerous mission

01:09.102 --> 01:10.896
that killed my last crew

01:10.965 --> 01:12.965
and you're not
nearly as good
as them.

01:13.034 --> 01:14.137
Whoo-hoo!

01:14.206 --> 01:15.793
We live to suck
another day.

01:15.861 --> 01:17.103
[ both humming tune]

01:19.793 --> 01:20.930
We are just as good

01:21.000 --> 01:22.585
as any of those
other crews

01:22.655 --> 01:24.067
you sent
to their deaths.

01:24.137 --> 01:25.206
What's the mission?

01:25.275 --> 01:26.585
Collecting honey.

01:26.655 --> 01:27.861
Ordinary honey.

01:27.930 --> 01:29.481
That doesn't sound
so dangerous.

01:29.551 --> 01:31.551
This is no ordinary honey.

01:31.620 --> 01:33.861
It's produced by
vicious space bees.

01:33.930 --> 01:36.481
A single sting
of their hideous
neurotoxin

01:36.551 --> 01:38.723
can cause instant death.

01:38.793 --> 01:40.412
And that's if you're
not allergic.

01:40.481 --> 01:42.516
You don't want to know
what happens then.

01:42.585 --> 01:43.758
No, no, no, God no.

01:43.826 --> 01:46.448
Your insides will boil
out of your eye sockets

01:46.516 --> 01:48.343
like a science fair volcano.

01:48.412 --> 01:50.033
I didn't want to know.

01:50.103 --> 01:51.412
[ sobbing]

01:51.481 --> 01:54.343
These bees are larger
than most Buicks.

01:54.412 --> 01:55.723
And twice as ugly.

01:55.793 --> 01:57.688
Larger than an American sedan?

01:57.758 --> 01:59.793
Whoo, how big is the honeycomb?

01:59.861 --> 02:02.412
Honeycomb's big...
yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:02.481 --> 02:03.620
It's not small?

02:03.688 --> 02:05.000
No, no, no.

02:05.067 --> 02:07.412
It'll take more than
deadly, deadly bees

02:07.481 --> 02:09.205
to keep us from
doing our job.

02:09.275 --> 02:10.413
Come on, boys.

02:10.481 --> 02:11.793
But, Leela, we're
no good.

02:11.861 --> 02:13.378
Listen, I'm scared too

02:13.448 --> 02:16.275
but I'm more scared
of disappointing myself.

02:16.343 --> 02:18.137
I'm not scared
of that at all.

02:24.137 --> 02:26.171
[ buzzing]

02:40.103 --> 02:43.240
Now, bees communicate
by dancing.

02:43.310 --> 02:44.343
Like my parents.

02:44.413 --> 02:46.137
Oh wait, that was hitting.

02:46.206 --> 02:48.965
LEELA:
So this language cartridge
will let you distract them.

02:49.033 --> 02:50.137
Ah, good.

02:50.206 --> 02:51.861
I often have thoughts
and feelings

02:51.930 --> 02:54.206
that can only be expressed
through dance.

02:56.688 --> 02:58.343

Uh...

03:21.896 --> 03:23.137
Leela, let's turn back.

03:23.205 --> 03:25.413
There's absolutely
no shame in wussing out.

03:25.481 --> 03:27.516
Relax. Everything
will be fine.

Oh, my God.

03:33.655 --> 03:35.378
There's the
black box.

03:35.448 --> 03:37.758
MAN 1:
Captain, the bees
have us surrounded!

03:37.826 --> 03:39.343
Oh, the Professor was right.

03:39.413 --> 03:41.206
We're not as good
as his old crew.

03:41.275 --> 03:43.240
MAN 2:
Well, I aim to prove him wrong.

03:43.310 --> 03:45.826
It'll take more than a few
deadly, deadly bees to...

make that out.

03:51.896 --> 03:53.171

We found it--

04:18.274 --> 04:19.862
Hey, what's this goo?

04:19.930 --> 04:20.964
Royal jelly.

04:21.033 --> 04:22.240
They feed it to the queen.

04:22.310 --> 04:24.826
Bees make honey and jelly?

04:24.896 --> 04:27.689
Huh, how come nothing humans
make tastes good?

Look.

It's a baby queen.

Ah, she's so cute.

You adorable wittle,

Leela, stop bonding
and let's go.

I got jelly in my underpants.

04:51.862 --> 04:53.550
I'm taking this bee with us.

04:53.620 --> 04:55.447
With a queen, we can
build a hive

04:55.516 --> 04:57.137
and make more
honey ourselves.

04:57.206 --> 04:59.723
Let me just pack
her a lunch and
we'll go.

the pace, lady.

they did better than us

06:33.447 --> 06:34.343
were suck and die.

Leela, we got lucky
this time.

be more careful.

to save me, Fry.

something up?

accounting tradition.

Fry's death took
only 15 seconds.

08:36.931 --> 08:39.136
Yet the pain
was so intense

08:39.206 --> 08:41.965
that it felt to him
like 15 years

08:42.033 --> 08:43.931
and it goes without saying

All those times I said,
"Kill all humans"

09:20.000 --> 09:22.620
I'd always whisper,
"Except one."

21:20.344 --> 21:22.275
Sweet three-toed sloth

21:22.344 --> 21:23.689
of ice planet Hoth!

21:23.758 --> 21:24.654
She's awake!

21:24.723 --> 21:26.205
[ all cheering]

21:26.275 --> 21:28.517
You were in the best coma
I've ever seen.

21:28.586 --> 21:30.689
The doctors said
you'd never wake up.

21:30.758 --> 21:33.000
Really? How long was I out?

21:33.067 --> 21:34.103
Two weeks.

21:34.172 --> 21:36.550
Fry never left your side
for a minute.

21:36.619 --> 21:37.758
And he talked nonstop.

21:37.826 --> 21:39.550
Like a parrot of the sea,
he was.

21:39.619 --> 21:41.931
I thought maybe
if you heard a familiar voice

21:42.000 --> 21:44.136
it might help
keep your mind together

21:44.205 --> 21:46.550
but who knows
if it really got through.

21:46.619 --> 21:49.067
It got through, Fry.

21:49.136 --> 21:51.895
It got through.

21:51.964 --> 21:53.517
FRY:  You could really use a shower.

21:53.586 --> 21:54.931
LEELA:
You, too.
