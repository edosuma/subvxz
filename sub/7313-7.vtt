â™ª

00:13.000 --> 00:16.043
MAN:
Welcome to Beltway Burgers.
Can I have your order, please?

00:16.086 --> 00:18.217
Yeah, I'll take a number ten.

00:18.260 --> 00:22.304
Extra pickles, extra cheese
and extra large fries.

00:22.347 --> 00:23.782
[phone ringing]

00:26.608 --> 00:28.652
Hey, honey.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.739
Where are you?I'm just getting off
the interstate.

00:30.782 --> 00:32.173
MAN:
$6.50. Next window.

00:32.217 --> 00:34.000
WOMAN: Like yell you are.
I heard that.

00:34.043 --> 00:36.304
You're breaking your diet again.No, I'm not.

00:36.347 --> 00:38.260
Your cholesterol's
through the roof.

00:38.304 --> 00:40.478
What are you doing this for?Honey, really...

00:40.521 --> 00:42.956
You promised me you'd take
better care of yourself.Oh, come on.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.826
You know what your doctor said.No.

00:44.869 --> 00:46.478
If you don't get it down,
you'll be sorry.

00:46.521 --> 00:48.260
One burger's
not going to kill me.

00:48.304 --> 00:49.913
Victor...Oh, you know what, look, I got
another call coming in.

00:49.956 --> 00:50.913
I'll call you back.

00:50.956 --> 00:52.086
Victor, don't you dare...!

00:52.130 --> 00:54.130
[sighs]

00:54.173 --> 00:55.565
She's worried about my health.

00:57.043 --> 00:58.652
Ahh!

00:58.695 --> 00:59.695
[groans]

01:36.130 --> 01:40.000
...twelve...

01:40.043 --> 01:43.043
thirteen...

01:43.086 --> 01:45.260
fourteen...

01:45.304 --> 01:48.130
McGEE:
Fifteen.

01:48.173 --> 01:49.869
Don't worry, you'll get
the hang of it soon.

01:49.913 --> 01:52.086
Way to kick a man
when he's down, probie.

01:52.130 --> 01:54.086
I cannot wait to hear this.
What's going on?

01:54.130 --> 01:56.608
Found 15 hairs in my
shower drain this morning.

01:56.652 --> 02:00.086
I tell you this because
you're my friends,
and I need you.

02:00.130 --> 02:03.130
For the past 12 years, every
morning I have counted
the hairs in my drain,

02:03.173 --> 02:04.260
and there have never
been more than five.

02:04.304 --> 02:05.826
Never more
than five.

02:05.869 --> 02:06.956
Never.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.130
Every day?For the last 12 years?

02:09.173 --> 02:11.347
You say that like
it's not normal.Well, that is not normal.

02:11.391 --> 02:14.130
What is not normal is a man of
my vim and vigor going bald.

02:14.173 --> 02:15.739
Well, bald can
be very sexy.

02:15.782 --> 02:17.608
Sure, I mean, if you're
Connery or Nicholson.

02:17.652 --> 02:19.043
Would you ever date
a bald man?

02:19.086 --> 02:22.000
I have dated men with
thinning hair, yes.

02:22.043 --> 02:24.391
[chuckling]:
Thinning hair,
but not... eck-eck.

02:24.434 --> 02:25.782
Baldy McBald.

02:25.826 --> 02:27.173
Hi, Special Agent
Baldy McBald here.

02:27.217 --> 02:29.043
Want to go to Mount Baldy
this weekend

02:29.086 --> 02:31.173
and do bald things? Bald.

02:31.217 --> 02:32.565
Tony, you're not going bald.

02:32.608 --> 02:34.608
Says the man with emerging
androgenetic alopecia.

02:34.652 --> 02:35.826
With what?

02:35.869 --> 02:37.260
You have a little
thin patch on your vertex.

02:37.304 --> 02:39.739
On my what?You got a little bit of the

02:39.782 --> 02:41.173
skin yarmulke happening, Tim.

02:41.217 --> 02:43.217
I thought I noticed
I was getting thin up there.

02:43.260 --> 02:46.086
TONY:
Yeah, everyone's noticed.

02:46.130 --> 02:47.347
You two are being ridiculous.
Everyone's hair thins.

02:47.391 --> 02:48.956
It's barely noticeable.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.782
And it's not like
you guys are going gray.

02:57.347 --> 02:58.913
I'm so glad that wasn't me.

02:58.956 --> 03:02.043
[phone ringing]Gray can be really sexy.

03:02.086 --> 03:03.782
Yeah, Gibbs.

03:04.782 --> 03:05.956
Lucky.

03:07.130 --> 03:09.000
Uh-huh.

03:09.043 --> 03:10.000
Dead body?

03:10.043 --> 03:10.826
No, worse.

03:10.869 --> 03:13.695
Where we going?Nowhere.

03:26.478 --> 03:28.652
Here you are.Thank you.

03:28.695 --> 03:32.086
What are you doing here?

03:32.130 --> 03:35.695
I was going to ask
you the same thing.

03:35.739 --> 03:38.478
She called both of us.

03:38.521 --> 03:40.043
That can't be good.

03:40.086 --> 03:43.086
You have any idea
what it's about?

03:43.130 --> 03:44.695
No.

03:44.739 --> 03:46.739
I can't drink that.

03:50.652 --> 03:52.217
Pass.

03:52.260 --> 03:55.217
Yeah, I'll probably need
something stronger.

03:55.260 --> 03:56.521
I heard that.

03:59.086 --> 04:00.695
Since when have you needed
an excuse to drink

04:00.739 --> 04:01.782
more than you should,
Agent Fornell?

04:01.826 --> 04:03.913
Nice to see you,
too, Mrs. Sterling.

04:03.956 --> 04:06.130
Agent Gibbs,
thank you for coming.

04:06.173 --> 04:07.782
Both of you.

04:07.826 --> 04:09.130
I didn't know who else to call.

04:09.173 --> 04:11.304
Figured that...When you called us.

04:11.347 --> 04:13.565
I need your help.

04:13.608 --> 04:15.304
Victor didn't come home
last night.

04:15.347 --> 04:18.086
That's a record, even for you.
Only married six months?

04:18.130 --> 04:19.826
Okay, Tobias, please, not now.

04:19.869 --> 04:21.130
You guys have a fight?No.

04:21.173 --> 04:23.086
Did you call the police?You know as well as I do

04:23.130 --> 04:24.608
it's too soon for them
to do anything.

04:24.652 --> 04:26.391
What do you want us to do?I want you to look into it.

04:29.086 --> 04:32.782
Okay, I know what
you guys are thinking,

04:32.826 --> 04:35.043
but Victor is not the kind
of man to just disappear.

04:35.086 --> 04:36.565
I'm not sure how to say this...

04:36.608 --> 04:37.565
I do.

04:37.608 --> 04:39.000
Look, we're not
your personal

04:39.043 --> 04:40.956
buddy-cop investigative service.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.043
No.
You're just my ex-husbands.

04:44.086 --> 04:45.391
[sighs]

04:45.434 --> 04:47.391
And I need your help.

04:56.043 --> 04:57.782
The last time I spoke
with Victor

04:57.826 --> 05:00.521
was 10:00 p.m., last night.
He was working late.

05:00.565 --> 05:01.913
Homeland Security, right?
Paper pusher?

05:01.956 --> 05:04.608
Data Storage Coordinator.Sounds important.

05:04.652 --> 05:06.217
It's not.
And he likes it that way.

05:06.260 --> 05:08.782
He's not married to his work.
He's married to his wife.

05:08.826 --> 05:11.260
It's a novel concept
for the two of you, I'm sure.

05:11.304 --> 05:12.956
Was he at the office
when you spoke?

05:13.000 --> 05:15.608
No, he had stopped
at some fast-food joint.

05:15.652 --> 05:18.304
He thinks I don't know,
but I can smell it on him.

05:18.347 --> 05:19.347
I'll bet.

05:19.391 --> 05:21.260
What is that supposed to mean?

05:21.304 --> 05:22.782
It means I wouldn't
go home either

05:22.826 --> 05:24.173
if I was covered in bacon grease

05:24.217 --> 05:25.391
and there was a
bloodhound waiting.

05:25.434 --> 05:27.000
Look, Diane,
we're trying to help.

05:27.043 --> 05:29.478
We have no evidence of a crime.You haven't even looked yet.

05:29.521 --> 05:30.782
My team is
checking hospitals;

05:30.826 --> 05:31.956
they're running
Victor's credit card.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.608
FORNELL: You have
to accept the chance

05:33.652 --> 05:35.521
that Victor might be
taking a little break.

05:35.565 --> 05:38.217
The three of us know
it wouldn't be the first time.

05:38.260 --> 05:39.869
No, it's not like this was.

05:39.913 --> 05:42.478
Victor and I have
a good relationship.

05:43.869 --> 05:45.869
He knows how to treat a woman.

05:45.913 --> 05:48.043
He's not afraid
to show his emotions

05:48.086 --> 05:50.739
like some people.She talking about us?

05:50.782 --> 05:52.000
He's not some immature child

05:52.043 --> 05:54.521
that relates better
to guns than to people.

05:54.565 --> 05:56.913
Okay, okay, we get it.

05:56.956 --> 05:59.086
Look, I know there's
no love lost between us.

05:59.130 --> 06:00.304
Well, that's not...Zip it, you.

06:01.304 --> 06:03.347
But I know you both,
and if your guts

06:03.391 --> 06:04.956
weren't telling you
there was something to this,

06:05.000 --> 06:06.347
I wouldn't be sitting
here right now.

06:06.391 --> 06:08.391
[thudding at door]

06:12.173 --> 06:13.826
Hey, boss.

06:13.869 --> 06:14.869
Agent Fornell.

06:14.913 --> 06:16.434
Ma'am.

06:16.478 --> 06:17.695
What?

06:17.739 --> 06:19.260
Red hair.

06:19.304 --> 06:21.565
We got a hit on
Victor's credit card.

06:21.608 --> 06:23.826
Beltway Burgers in DC.
10:00 p.m. last night.

06:23.869 --> 06:26.043
That's federal
jurisdiction.Anything else?

06:26.086 --> 06:27.956
Yeah. There was a 911 call
made

06:28.000 --> 06:30.043
from the same place
about a half hour ago.

06:30.086 --> 06:31.869
Morning crew found a bloodbath.

06:38.826 --> 06:40.608
Two males.
Gunshots to the head.

06:40.652 --> 06:42.043
Both local DC residents.

06:42.086 --> 06:43.521
That guy's got good hair.

06:43.565 --> 06:44.782
Nothing's missing
from the register.

06:44.826 --> 06:46.434
Security footage?Mm-hmm.

06:46.478 --> 06:48.217
McGEE: Car in the drive-thru is
registered to Victor Sterling.

06:48.260 --> 06:50.434
FORNELL: I don't suppose
he was hiding in the trunk?

06:50.478 --> 06:52.826
No, but I did find
his wallet

06:52.869 --> 06:54.695
and a gun
near the car.

06:54.739 --> 06:56.304
I hate telling Diane
she's right.

06:56.347 --> 06:58.913
DUCKY:
Sorry I'm late, Jethro. [sighs]

06:58.956 --> 07:01.260
Would you mind pointing
that somewhere else?

07:01.304 --> 07:02.782
Late night, Duck?

07:02.826 --> 07:05.782
I haven't been sleeping well
this past week.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.217
Enough said.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.826
My bodies are on ice.

07:08.869 --> 07:11.782
How considerate.

07:11.826 --> 07:13.826
Gibbs, security footage
was erased.

07:13.869 --> 07:15.173
Violent take-over,

07:15.217 --> 07:18.347
two dead guys, missing
Homeland Security official.

07:18.391 --> 07:20.565
You know what I'm thinking?

07:20.608 --> 07:23.521
Victor was so desperate
to get away from Diane,
he had himself kidnapped?

07:23.565 --> 07:26.260
That would make more sense
than the alternative.

07:26.304 --> 07:28.304
Hi. Thomas Pearce,
Homeland Security.

07:28.347 --> 07:29.956
I came as soon
as I got your call.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.434
However, I only budgeted 20
minutes for the meeting, so...

07:32.478 --> 07:33.826
Who's this clown?

07:33.869 --> 07:35.173
What's the alternative?

07:35.217 --> 07:36.782
That someone actually wanted
to kidnap Victor.

07:36.826 --> 07:37.913
He works for
Homeland Security.

07:37.956 --> 07:39.695
Someone might find
that interesting.

07:39.739 --> 07:41.391
You know, like terrorists?

07:41.434 --> 07:42.826
Homeland Security?

07:42.869 --> 07:45.217
Yep, Homeland Security.

07:45.260 --> 07:46.782
Nice hair.

07:46.826 --> 07:48.565
The only thing he ever had
access to at Homeland

07:48.608 --> 07:50.695
were pencil inventories
and mileage logs.

07:50.739 --> 07:54.608
What I find interesting is
how the same woman landed
both Gibbs and Fornell.

07:54.652 --> 07:55.869
Why? They're very
much alike.

07:55.913 --> 07:58.217
I don't think so.
Gibbs is wild savannah.

07:58.260 --> 07:59.782
Untamed.

07:59.826 --> 08:02.695
This Diane lady must
have serious game

08:02.739 --> 08:05.043
to have landed
a wild beast like that.

08:05.086 --> 08:08.434
[chuckles]Wonder what her game is.

08:08.478 --> 08:10.217
We still need to see whatever
he was working on.

08:10.260 --> 08:12.391
Of course.One of your employees

08:12.434 --> 08:14.217
has gone missing.
You don't seem too concerned.

08:14.260 --> 08:15.826
Oh, I am.

08:15.869 --> 08:18.608
At least I will be
after this conference call.

08:18.652 --> 08:20.869
I have to inform our entire
data services department

08:20.913 --> 08:22.043
we're officially switching over

08:22.086 --> 08:23.347
to a dual-layer DVD backup
medium.

08:23.391 --> 08:25.043
Ooh.

08:25.086 --> 08:27.043
We got our own problems.

08:27.086 --> 08:29.043
We still need to tell
Diane about her husband.

08:29.086 --> 08:30.217
Not much to tell yet.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.086
Yeah, that's the problem.Yeah.

08:32.130 --> 08:35.173
Well, good luck with that.

08:35.217 --> 08:36.260
[chuckles]
Be nice.

08:36.304 --> 08:38.000
I'm going to go over
to the Bureau,

08:38.043 --> 08:39.956
run background
on our two victims.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.826
[laughs][whispering]

08:42.869 --> 08:44.695
I'm a bald version
of you... Oh!

08:51.130 --> 08:52.826
Took you long enough.What do you got?

08:52.869 --> 08:54.130
Questions, and
lots of them.

08:54.173 --> 08:55.956
Shoot.Okay, first up:

08:56.000 --> 08:58.695
How quickly after you
and Diane got a divorce

08:58.739 --> 09:00.826
did she start dating Fornell?

09:00.869 --> 09:03.000
Because that must have
been, you know, awkward.

09:03.826 --> 09:07.391
Um, okay, so we'll just, we'll
just circle back to that one.

09:07.434 --> 09:08.521
Question number two:

09:08.565 --> 09:10.695
Were you jealous?

09:12.217 --> 09:16.608
Okay, so I see you're not
ready to talk about this yet.

09:16.652 --> 09:18.652
Um, can I get a do-over?

09:27.956 --> 09:29.347
What do you got, Abbs?Security footage.

09:29.391 --> 09:32.478
Which was erased.It was, but not securely.

09:32.521 --> 09:34.521
So I'm working on
reformatting the data.

09:34.565 --> 09:37.695
I had more success with
the gun that you found.

09:37.739 --> 09:39.521
It is registered
to Victor Sterling,

09:39.565 --> 09:41.739
and it has been fired
maybe for the first time.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.260
Which reminds me--

09:43.304 --> 09:45.478
did it bother you when
Diane chose a husband

09:45.521 --> 09:46.826
so opposite to you?Abbs!

09:46.869 --> 09:50.000
Sorry. Victor's prints
were on the gun,

09:50.043 --> 09:52.217
so it looks like he did
put up some sort of fight.

09:52.260 --> 09:53.782
The most interesting
thing that I found

09:53.826 --> 09:55.130
is what I didn't find.

09:55.173 --> 09:57.391
Victor's wallet was
obsessively organized.

09:57.434 --> 09:58.913
But one card was missing.

09:58.956 --> 10:01.478
Now, leather deforms
when it's compressed,

10:01.521 --> 10:03.826
and it takes hours for it
to return to its prior shape.

10:03.869 --> 10:06.347
Based on the amount of
residual deformation,

10:06.391 --> 10:09.913
that card was removed almost
the same time as the murders.

10:09.956 --> 10:10.869
Any idea why?

10:10.913 --> 10:12.478
No.

10:12.521 --> 10:15.695
Like I said, I have more
questions than answers.

10:22.043 --> 10:23.217
Where's Gibbs?

10:23.260 --> 10:24.434
Down in Abby's lab.

10:24.478 --> 10:25.826
Where's...

10:27.652 --> 10:28.565
...her?

10:28.608 --> 10:30.260
Diane? Getting
something to eat.

10:30.304 --> 10:32.478
Hope she kills it first.Yeah, she's pretty fiery.

10:32.521 --> 10:34.695
Can't be all bad.
You married her.

10:35.869 --> 10:37.782
Don't remind him.

10:37.826 --> 10:41.086
Got background on our two
dead burger employees.

10:41.130 --> 10:43.869
One's a Navy reservist.TONY: Guess that makes it
official now.

10:43.913 --> 10:47.739
NCIS-FBI joint case.

10:47.782 --> 10:49.739
A marriage of sorts,
if you will.

10:49.782 --> 10:50.956
Sorry.

10:52.304 --> 10:54.826
The other's an aspiring model,

10:54.869 --> 10:57.173
recently divorced.You check the ex-wife?

10:57.217 --> 10:58.391
It was an amicable split.
Imagine that.

10:58.434 --> 10:59.869
50-50 down the line.

10:59.913 --> 11:01.652
Whereas you and I had
our bank accounts cleaned out.

11:01.695 --> 11:02.956
She even took
your grandfather's watch.

11:04.478 --> 11:06.826
Let it out.
Just let it all out.I'd rather you didn't.

11:06.869 --> 11:07.782
ZIVA:
We finished the
background search

11:07.826 --> 11:08.869
on Victor Sterling.

11:08.913 --> 11:10.695
McGEE:
Pretty much
what Diane said.

11:10.739 --> 11:13.956
He grew up in Chicago,
went to college at UW-Madison.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.130
Joined Homeland Security
five years ago.

11:16.173 --> 11:18.043
Lives a simple,
modest life.

11:18.086 --> 11:19.347
Except?

11:19.391 --> 11:20.739
Nothing modest
about his bank accounts.

11:20.782 --> 11:21.739
ZIVA:
At least the ones

11:21.782 --> 11:23.000
he has taken great pains
to hide.

11:27.130 --> 11:28.565
Oh, Victor.

11:28.608 --> 11:30.304
He has dozens of
offshore bank accounts.

11:30.347 --> 11:32.000
The guy is loaded.

11:32.043 --> 11:32.913
Where'd it all come from?

11:32.956 --> 11:34.782
Not what I'm wondering.

11:34.826 --> 11:36.826
Why is he hiding it?

11:36.869 --> 11:38.956
Oh... oh...

11:48.043 --> 11:49.565
VANCE:
Two dead bodies,

11:49.608 --> 11:51.391
a missing
Homeland Security agent

11:51.434 --> 11:52.826
and a lot of cash.

11:52.869 --> 11:54.782
Maybe that's what
made him a target.

11:54.826 --> 11:56.347
Did you ask his wife
about the money?

11:56.391 --> 11:58.347
Not yet.Are you going to?

11:58.391 --> 11:59.565
He can.
He can.

11:59.608 --> 12:01.173
I don't think she
knows about it.

12:01.217 --> 12:03.217
Well, have fun finding
out, Agent Fornell.

12:03.260 --> 12:04.565
I spoke to your boss.

12:04.608 --> 12:06.217
We have a dead Naval Reservist,

12:06.260 --> 12:07.869
but kidnapping
is your territory.

12:07.913 --> 12:10.043
Fine with me.Agent Fornell
will take the lead...

12:11.304 --> 12:12.391
Excuse me?

12:12.434 --> 12:13.478
Works for me.

12:13.521 --> 12:14.478
Well, it doesn't for me.

12:14.521 --> 12:15.391
Any chance we can flip for it?

12:15.434 --> 12:16.826
VANCE:
No. National security

12:16.869 --> 12:18.739
trumps your
ex-wife issues.

12:18.782 --> 12:20.347
She can't be all bad.
You married her.

12:20.391 --> 12:21.565
WOMAN:
Stop! Ma'am, you
can't go in there!

12:21.608 --> 12:23.391
When the hell
were you going to tell me?

12:23.434 --> 12:24.956
Speak of the Devil.You must be Mrs....

12:25.000 --> 12:27.347
$2 million?
Victor has $2 million?

12:27.391 --> 12:28.434
Boss, she made me
tell her.

12:28.478 --> 12:29.565
Who needs enhanced
interrogation?

12:29.608 --> 12:31.260
What else haven't you told me?

12:31.304 --> 12:32.695
We can talk
about this downstairs.

12:32.739 --> 12:34.260
What, do you have a basement
here, too, Mr. Woodchuck?

12:34.304 --> 12:36.304
Mrs. Sterling,
I'm Director Vance.

12:36.347 --> 12:38.608
Rest assured my agents
are doing everything possible

12:38.652 --> 12:40.478
to find your husband.Thank you.

12:40.521 --> 12:42.043
Just make sure
they keep me informed, too.

12:42.086 --> 12:44.478
Wasn't any fun
trying to pry information

12:44.521 --> 12:46.652
out of Macaulay Culkin here.

12:46.695 --> 12:48.826
That's Victor's wallet.
Oh, my God, there's blood.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.391
It's not his.

12:50.434 --> 12:51.608
If it had just been a robbery,

12:51.652 --> 12:52.739
they would have taken
his wallet, right?

12:52.782 --> 12:54.043
They did take one
of his cards.

12:54.086 --> 12:55.217
We don't know
which, though.

12:55.260 --> 12:56.521
Which slot was it in?

12:56.565 --> 12:57.608
Excuse me?

12:57.652 --> 12:59.956
[sighs]
Driver's license,

13:00.000 --> 13:01.434
ATM card, Visa,

13:01.478 --> 13:02.782
photo of Shannon,
cash, in that order.

13:02.826 --> 13:04.260
Tri-fold wallet.

13:04.304 --> 13:06.260
Starting from the left side,
condom beneath the fold...

13:06.304 --> 13:07.260
Okay, we got it.

13:07.304 --> 13:09.086
McGEE:
Excuse me.

13:09.130 --> 13:10.478
Do you know

13:10.521 --> 13:11.391
what Victor
keeps here?

13:11.434 --> 13:12.695
Didn't have a name on it,

13:12.739 --> 13:14.043
but I remember the logo.

13:20.565 --> 13:22.086
Huh.

13:22.130 --> 13:24.086
Man's wallet
is his kingdom.

13:24.130 --> 13:27.260
The snooping says a lot
about Gibbs' ex.

13:27.304 --> 13:28.521
Well, maybe Victor
did something

13:28.565 --> 13:29.739
to deserve
her lack of trust.

13:29.782 --> 13:31.434
After all, he is
hiding something.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.521
[motor whining]

13:34.869 --> 13:36.652
Agent DiNozzo,
I presume?

13:38.173 --> 13:40.434
Curtis Hubley,
day manager.

13:40.478 --> 13:41.739
Agent David.

13:42.521 --> 13:43.826
[horn honking]

13:43.869 --> 13:45.173
[honking and whining stop]

13:47.478 --> 13:49.391
You're really hot.Thank you.

13:49.434 --> 13:51.434
You don't get out
much, do you, bud?

13:51.478 --> 13:52.739
Not really.

13:52.782 --> 13:56.043
This is Victor Sterling,
Homeland Security.

13:56.086 --> 13:57.434
Have you seen him?
Yeah.

13:57.478 --> 13:58.608
He's here once
every few months

13:58.652 --> 14:00.434
for his routine
inspection.

14:00.478 --> 14:02.000
What does he inspect?Our systems.

14:02.043 --> 14:03.347
We're an off-site
data storage facility

14:03.391 --> 14:05.478
for the local
Homeland Security office.

14:05.521 --> 14:07.521
We back up their, uh,
accounting data,

14:07.565 --> 14:08.956
personnel records,

14:09.000 --> 14:10.304
noncritical stuff.

14:10.347 --> 14:11.913
Victor in some
kind of trouble?

14:11.956 --> 14:13.826
Well, we believe
that he has been kidnapped, yes.

14:13.869 --> 14:15.217
That's terrible.

14:15.260 --> 14:17.347
So you want to get a drink,
talk about it?

14:17.391 --> 14:19.565
No.
I figured that.

14:19.608 --> 14:21.652
Any idea why Victor
was kidnapped?

14:21.695 --> 14:22.956
Not yet.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.869
But the access card
that he used for this place

14:25.913 --> 14:27.347
is missing.

14:27.391 --> 14:29.869
We would like you to check
to see if anyone has used it.

14:29.913 --> 14:32.130
Sure. Yeah.
That's easy enough.

14:32.173 --> 14:34.869
You have the...
softest-looking skin.

14:34.913 --> 14:36.434
Now you're
getting creepy.

14:36.478 --> 14:37.782
I know. I'm sorry.
I'm working on it.

14:37.826 --> 14:39.304
Okay. Victor.

14:39.347 --> 14:42.130
Access card.

14:42.173 --> 14:44.521
[typing, computer trilling]

14:46.000 --> 14:47.478
Here you go.

14:49.130 --> 14:50.521
Good job.

14:51.869 --> 14:53.478
Got me a little excited.

14:53.521 --> 14:56.043
Card was used
just last night around 12:00.

14:56.086 --> 14:57.782
That was after
he was taken.

14:57.826 --> 14:59.478
Mm-hmm.
We have
security footage.

14:59.521 --> 15:01.217
It's normally offline
for maintenance at midnight,

15:01.260 --> 15:02.478
but we switched the schedule.

15:02.521 --> 15:04.521
[snaps]Pull it up.

15:04.565 --> 15:06.521
Yeah.

15:06.565 --> 15:08.956
It's on a different system.
Be back in a flash.

15:10.086 --> 15:11.391
I think he likes you.

15:11.434 --> 15:12.304
[chuckles]

15:12.347 --> 15:14.304
Got it.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.565
Here you go.

15:17.652 --> 15:20.434
That's the entrance
to the server room.

15:22.173 --> 15:23.478
Is there another angle?

15:23.521 --> 15:25.521
You got it.

15:27.304 --> 15:28.652
Blow that up.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.260
Uh-huh.

15:30.304 --> 15:31.260
TONY: Oh.

15:31.304 --> 15:33.000
Can you freeze that?
Yup.

15:34.478 --> 15:37.043
That's Victor.
Mm-hmm.

15:37.086 --> 15:38.826
Anything else
I can do for you, baby?

15:40.956 --> 15:42.391
Got to tell you,
I never saw this coming.

15:42.434 --> 15:44.304
But it is somewhat
satisfying.

15:44.347 --> 15:46.043
TONY:
Sterling entered
the facility

15:46.086 --> 15:48.043
at 12:14 a.m.
this morning.

15:48.086 --> 15:49.391
Two hours after
he disappeared

15:49.434 --> 15:50.782
from the fast food
restaurant.

15:50.826 --> 15:53.391
TONY:
Once inside,
downloaded a single file.

15:53.434 --> 15:55.304
What'd he take?

15:55.347 --> 15:56.782
ZIVA:
We're not sure yet

15:56.826 --> 15:59.130
because he erased the file
header when he logged out.

15:59.173 --> 16:00.608
McGee said it was just
a bunch of numbers.

16:00.652 --> 16:02.347
Numbers?He thinks it's
accounting-related.

16:02.391 --> 16:03.521
Maybe a budget.

16:03.565 --> 16:05.000
He and Abby
are working on it now.

16:05.043 --> 16:06.217
Well, he is
a glorified accountant.

16:06.260 --> 16:07.739
Yeah, with two million bucks
in the bank.

16:07.782 --> 16:09.304
What are you thinking?
Embezzlement?

16:09.347 --> 16:10.347
TONY:
You guys would know

16:10.391 --> 16:12.913
better than anyone
what he's up to.

16:14.173 --> 16:15.391
Yeah?

16:15.434 --> 16:16.695
Why is that, DiNozzo?

16:17.739 --> 16:19.347
You were both
married to his wife.

16:19.391 --> 16:20.434
I'm not following you.

16:20.478 --> 16:21.826
Well, she must have
a type, right?

16:21.869 --> 16:23.130
TONY:
So, you must have

16:23.173 --> 16:24.434
a lot in common with Victor.FORNELL:
Nothing.

16:24.478 --> 16:26.521
Couldn't be more
opposite. In fact...

16:26.565 --> 16:28.434
If I may interject,
someone should talk to Diane

16:28.478 --> 16:30.521
to make sure that Victor
has not tried to contact her.

16:30.565 --> 16:32.000
She has a point.Yeah, she does.

16:32.043 --> 16:34.086
And you got lead.

16:34.130 --> 16:35.739
Hey. Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

16:35.782 --> 16:37.391
Where are you going? Isn't the
conference room the other way?

16:37.434 --> 16:39.391
That's why I'm headed
to autopsy.

16:39.434 --> 16:40.478
[sighs]

16:40.521 --> 16:42.043
DiNozzo,
determine whether Victor

16:42.086 --> 16:43.652
had any contact with Diane.

16:51.869 --> 16:54.869
Divorce is as old as Hammurabi,

16:54.913 --> 16:58.652
whose code allowed it
almost 4,000 years ago.

16:58.695 --> 17:02.391
Other countries took
a little longer to catch up.

17:02.434 --> 17:05.000
For instance, in Ireland,

17:05.043 --> 17:08.565
divorce wasn't legalized
until 1997.

17:08.608 --> 17:10.043
Thank God I'm not Irish.

17:10.086 --> 17:11.391
Can you imagine being
stuck with her?

17:11.434 --> 17:12.826
Don't have to imagine.
We are.

17:12.869 --> 17:15.043
Unless you can pull a rabbit
out of that body, Duck.

17:15.086 --> 17:16.173
Mm. Sorry.

17:16.217 --> 17:17.695
This man's last meal

17:17.739 --> 17:20.173
consisted solely
of fried cheese.

17:20.217 --> 17:21.652
But there are some
things to note.

17:21.695 --> 17:25.000
The first is an oddity
concerning rope burns

17:25.043 --> 17:27.043
where the victims'
hands were bound.

17:28.478 --> 17:30.826
I don't see any rope burns.Well, that's the oddity.

17:30.869 --> 17:32.086
Both victims' wrists

17:32.130 --> 17:35.347
were tied, yet neither
apparently struggled.

17:35.391 --> 17:37.000
Sedated?
Negative.

17:37.043 --> 17:40.565
It's highly unusual not to see
some signs of a struggle--

17:40.608 --> 17:43.521
unless, of course,
they were feigning captivity.

17:43.565 --> 17:45.391
They weren't feigning
being shot in the head.

17:45.434 --> 17:47.086
Perhaps they just outlived
their usefulness.

17:47.130 --> 17:49.130
Are you suggesting the
crime scene was faked, Ducky?

17:49.173 --> 17:50.565
To just make it look

17:50.608 --> 17:51.913
like Victor was abducted?

17:51.956 --> 17:54.130
Yeah, well, the theory
casts a new light on this.

17:54.173 --> 17:56.478
Abby ran ballistic tests
on the bullets

17:56.521 --> 17:58.043
that killed these two.

17:58.086 --> 18:01.130
They were fired
from Victor's gun.

18:01.173 --> 18:03.521
Oh, well, that's just peachy.

18:03.565 --> 18:05.086
Unless, of course, the killer

18:05.130 --> 18:07.478
used Victor's gun
for the murders.

18:07.521 --> 18:08.565
Or he is the murderer.

18:11.347 --> 18:13.304
TONY:
And you've had absolutely

18:13.347 --> 18:15.521
no contact with your husband
since the last phone call?

18:15.565 --> 18:16.956
I have already
told you no.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.347
This is such
a waste of time.

18:18.391 --> 18:19.869
Where are Leroy
and Tobias?

18:19.913 --> 18:21.695
Leroy?

18:21.739 --> 18:22.913
Yes, Leroy.

18:22.956 --> 18:24.347
You do know your boss's name.

18:24.391 --> 18:26.260
Of course I do. Just never
heard it pronounced that way.

18:26.304 --> 18:27.478
How do you pronounce it?

18:27.521 --> 18:28.434
Gibbs.

18:28.478 --> 18:30.478
And he's busy.

18:30.521 --> 18:31.869
I just have
a few more questions.

18:31.913 --> 18:33.869
True or false.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.434
You're an exceptionally
good cook.

18:35.478 --> 18:36.913
Excuse me?

18:36.956 --> 18:38.347
Cook. Food.

18:38.391 --> 18:39.521
You like to cook?

18:39.565 --> 18:40.782
Oh, my God.

18:40.826 --> 18:42.130
You're trying
to figure out

18:42.173 --> 18:43.391
why Leroy married me.

18:43.434 --> 18:45.826
[chuckling]:
No.

18:45.869 --> 18:48.000
Wow, you're a terrible liar.I'm a fantastic liar.

18:48.043 --> 18:52.000
Just not very good
at it right now.

18:52.043 --> 18:54.260
I could tell you
why Leroy married me...

18:56.434 --> 18:58.391
but you have a job to do, and...

18:58.434 --> 18:59.304
you wouldn't be
able to concentrate

18:59.347 --> 19:01.347
the rest of the day if I do.

19:03.391 --> 19:05.043
I think that ship's
already sailed.

19:05.086 --> 19:07.869
Leroy, what's with the 20
questions from your agent?

19:08.913 --> 19:10.173
Victor is now a suspect

19:10.217 --> 19:11.173
in our investigation.

19:11.217 --> 19:12.173
Is that a joke?

19:12.217 --> 19:14.000
Uh... this was taken

19:14.043 --> 19:16.130
at a data storage facility

19:16.173 --> 19:17.391
after Victor disappeared.

19:17.434 --> 19:18.826
And his gun
was used

19:18.869 --> 19:20.608
in the murders
at the drive-through.

19:20.652 --> 19:22.260
I-I don't understand.

19:22.304 --> 19:23.782
Neither do we.I do.

19:23.826 --> 19:25.739
And I wish I didn't.
Bad news, Gibbs.

19:25.782 --> 19:27.956
We were able to identify the
data that Victor downloaded.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.652
It was just numbers,
but it wasn't a budget.

19:29.695 --> 19:30.869
It was a recipe.

19:30.913 --> 19:32.217
For what?

19:32.260 --> 19:33.434
For a virus.

19:33.478 --> 19:34.782
One that could kill
a lot of people.

19:44.608 --> 19:46.391
ABBY:
This is the data
Victor downloaded.

19:46.434 --> 19:47.782
So what we thought

19:47.826 --> 19:49.173
were budget numbers

19:49.217 --> 19:50.956
is actually a numerical
representation

19:51.000 --> 19:52.782
of a virus genome.

19:52.826 --> 19:54.826
That make sense
to you?
No.

19:54.869 --> 19:57.434
It's simple.
DNA is just a code.

19:57.478 --> 19:59.826
When we sequence it,
we figure out what the code is,

19:59.869 --> 20:01.956
and then we store it
as a series of numbers.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.565
Gibbs, you remember Carol?
Uh, she's a lab tech at the V.A.

20:04.608 --> 20:06.130
Infectious Disease
Program Office.

20:06.173 --> 20:07.956
What's your name, cutie?

20:08.000 --> 20:10.826
Tobias. I'm old enough
to be your father.

20:10.869 --> 20:12.347
I asked Carol
to try to help me

20:12.391 --> 20:15.304
ID which virus
this genome belongs to.

20:15.347 --> 20:17.869
Ebola variant RUV-76.

20:17.913 --> 20:19.956
The usual stuff--
you bleed from every orifice.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.173
It disintegrates your organs,
and then you die.

20:22.217 --> 20:23.304
From numbers?

20:23.347 --> 20:24.391
Well, that's
all these were

20:24.434 --> 20:25.739
ten years ago
when they were sequenced

20:25.782 --> 20:27.217
and stored and forgotten
in some warehouse.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.217
But times have changed.

20:29.260 --> 20:31.043
It's now possible
to build

20:31.086 --> 20:33.173
a synthetic virus
from scratch

20:33.217 --> 20:35.173
using a numerical recipe
just like this

20:35.217 --> 20:36.695
and gene sequences
you can get online.

20:36.739 --> 20:37.869
I keep saying it--

20:37.913 --> 20:39.347
things were better
before the Internet.

20:39.391 --> 20:41.000
How bad?
It's bad,

20:41.043 --> 20:44.086
but the good news is, this
variant is only spread by touch

20:44.130 --> 20:46.565
and it's too virulent
to cause a pandemic.

20:46.608 --> 20:48.913
Which is a nice way
of saying people die too quickly

20:48.956 --> 20:50.304
to spread the disease too far.

20:50.347 --> 20:51.347
FORNELL:
Doesn't make
sense, Gibbs.

20:51.391 --> 20:52.782
Victor strike you
as a terrorist?

20:52.826 --> 20:53.913
No.
I mean,

20:53.956 --> 20:56.043
he's a paper pusher,
not a mass murderer.

20:56.086 --> 20:57.695
Embezzlement I'll buy.

20:57.739 --> 20:59.086
Maybe this is his big score.

20:59.130 --> 21:01.000
I mean, if terrorism
was his goal,

21:01.043 --> 21:04.478
there were way deadlier viruses
to steal in this database.

21:04.521 --> 21:05.652
This virus is tactical.

21:05.695 --> 21:07.304
It would make
the perfect weapon.

21:07.347 --> 21:08.173
It'd be
worth millions

21:08.217 --> 21:09.478
if he found
the right buyer.

21:09.521 --> 21:10.869
He doesn't want to use it.

21:10.913 --> 21:12.043
He wants to sell it.

21:12.086 --> 21:13.565
But first he has to build it.

21:13.608 --> 21:15.304
And there's only one place
in the area

21:15.347 --> 21:17.608
that has the ability
to create man-made viruses.

21:21.608 --> 21:22.826
Right.

21:24.869 --> 21:26.130
[door unlocks]

21:26.173 --> 21:27.608
[electronic buzzing]

21:31.434 --> 21:32.608
[door closes]

21:32.652 --> 21:34.217
FORNELL:
Lot of pricey equipment here

21:34.260 --> 21:36.260
to just leave
the front door open.

21:36.304 --> 21:38.086
GIBBS:
Noticed.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.086
ZIVA:
Man down!

21:42.217 --> 21:44.521
FORNELL:
Smells like a morgue.

21:52.260 --> 21:54.695
FORNELL:
Where is everybody?

21:56.043 --> 21:57.739
Found them.

22:05.956 --> 22:08.260
ZIVA:
They tried to shoot
their way out.

22:08.304 --> 22:10.260
FORNELL:
Didn't get very far.

22:14.391 --> 22:17.173
Looks like they built
the virus.

22:21.521 --> 22:24.695
And took it with them.

22:26.173 --> 22:29.391
Ziva says the HazMat teams
are clearing the lab now.

22:29.434 --> 22:31.608
Ducky will be able
to autopsy the bodies soon.

22:31.652 --> 22:33.130
I think we know
what killed them.

22:33.173 --> 22:34.782
IDs?
Well, the lab ID'd
the two techs.

22:34.826 --> 22:36.130
We ID'd the other two.

22:36.173 --> 22:38.347
Got Dwight Kilborn
and Jeremiah Ness.

22:38.391 --> 22:40.043
Both ex-Special Forces.

22:40.086 --> 22:41.869
Both have been freelancing
for mercenary groups

22:41.913 --> 22:43.173
for the last ten months.

22:43.217 --> 22:45.956
Been doing more than that.
Abby was able

22:46.000 --> 22:47.217
to reconstruct
part of the erased

22:47.260 --> 22:50.260
security tapes
from the burger place.

22:56.043 --> 22:57.086
McGEE:
Gunmen look familiar?

22:57.130 --> 22:58.608
TONY: That's what I was
talking about.

22:58.652 --> 23:01.173
See? That's the thinning
part on the vertex.

23:01.217 --> 23:03.043
FORNELL:
Those are our stiffs
from the lab.

23:03.086 --> 23:04.521
They hit a fast food joint
one night,

23:04.565 --> 23:06.739
then they end up dead in a lab
the next? What gives?

23:06.782 --> 23:09.000
TONY:
Victor doesn't look
in charge to me.

23:09.043 --> 23:10.130
Looks like a victim.

23:10.173 --> 23:11.434
Could be what
we're supposed to think.

23:11.478 --> 23:12.521
What do you mean?

23:12.565 --> 23:13.869
McGEE:
Well, these guys
are pros.

23:13.913 --> 23:15.304
They had to know
we'd be able

23:15.347 --> 23:16.391
to reconstruct
the videotapes.

23:16.434 --> 23:17.608
TONY: Which means
we'd see Victor

23:17.652 --> 23:19.869
getting grabbed.
AKA victim.

23:19.913 --> 23:21.739
Seriously? Victor fakes his own
kidnapping, then he steals

23:21.782 --> 23:24.173
a deadly virus, and then uses
that to kill his own crew?

23:24.217 --> 23:25.304
How devious is this guy?

23:25.347 --> 23:26.695
Wouldn't be
the first time

23:26.739 --> 23:28.000
she married
the wrong guy.

23:28.043 --> 23:30.043
Of course, he's not the only one
keeping secrets.

23:31.086 --> 23:33.652
You didn't tell them?

23:33.695 --> 23:37.173
What?
Well, you had told us
to back-check Victor

23:37.217 --> 23:40.478
and Diane, and we came up
with some discrepancies.

23:40.521 --> 23:41.391
What discrepancies?

23:41.434 --> 23:42.739
Diane had mentioned in passing

23:42.782 --> 23:44.434
she never left the country.Yeah, and?

23:44.478 --> 23:46.913
Well, being extremely diligent,
I checked her PNR,

23:46.956 --> 23:50.652
and it places her in
the Cayman Islands in '04,

23:50.695 --> 23:52.478
then again in '06.Are you sure?

23:52.521 --> 23:53.913
Well, the only reason
I mention it

23:53.956 --> 23:55.652
is because the
Caymans are the

23:55.695 --> 23:57.391
money-laundering
capital of the world.Wait, wait, wait.

23:57.434 --> 23:59.347
She may be the spawn of Satan,

23:59.391 --> 24:01.260
but she's also the mother
of my child.

24:01.304 --> 24:02.782
No way Diane is involved.

24:02.826 --> 24:06.130
Rule 69: Never trust a woman
who doesn't trust her man.

24:06.173 --> 24:07.260
Keep digging.

24:07.304 --> 24:08.652
How deep?

24:08.695 --> 24:10.521
Till you get
to the bottom.

24:12.086 --> 24:14.304
[drink pouring]

24:16.521 --> 24:20.652
You son of a bitch!
How dare you!

24:20.695 --> 24:24.695
What the hell are you doing
poking into my private life?!

24:24.739 --> 24:26.652
Doing my job.

24:26.695 --> 24:28.739
I'm not the one who's missing,
Victor is!

24:31.521 --> 24:33.695
You knew I
was coming.

24:36.304 --> 24:38.260
No.

24:43.260 --> 24:44.956
Tell me about the Caymans.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.391
Ancient history.

24:53.913 --> 24:58.347
Have you been just
waiting for this
all these years?

24:58.391 --> 25:01.347
An opportunity to
twist the knife in?

25:05.086 --> 25:06.608
No.

25:06.652 --> 25:09.565
No, that's your specialty .

25:09.608 --> 25:10.956
Your way of getting

25:11.000 --> 25:12.826
even with me for leaving you?

25:12.869 --> 25:16.521
Should give you a medal.

25:16.565 --> 25:17.739
Yeah, well, if
there is a medal,

25:17.782 --> 25:19.434
I do deserve it for
staying so long.

25:19.478 --> 25:22.826
It wasn't easy being
a human anti-depressant.

25:24.086 --> 25:26.391
What, you didn't think I knew?

25:27.695 --> 25:29.521
You just married me
to get over Shannon?

25:36.521 --> 25:38.652
Sorry.

25:38.695 --> 25:40.739
That, that was...

25:43.173 --> 25:45.217
I'm scared, Leroy.

25:50.173 --> 25:52.391
Then tell me about the Caymans.

26:03.347 --> 26:05.565
I met someone in '04.

26:05.608 --> 26:07.434
He had a place
in the Caymans.

26:07.478 --> 26:09.173
I had a husband who, uh,

26:09.217 --> 26:11.260
was never around.

26:11.304 --> 26:14.521
This guy paid attention to me.

26:14.565 --> 26:17.130
That's all I ever
wanted, you know?

26:17.173 --> 26:20.391
From you or Tobias.

26:20.434 --> 26:23.043
Just somebody
to be there, you know?

26:23.086 --> 26:26.130
So you married him?

26:29.347 --> 26:32.043
Yep, six months ago.

26:32.086 --> 26:34.565
By the way,
thanks for the waffle iron.

26:34.608 --> 26:35.652
Victor loves it.

26:40.173 --> 26:41.565
[glass thuds on table]

26:41.608 --> 26:43.347
Leroy, whatever...

26:43.391 --> 26:45.913
you think Victor's involved in,
you're wrong.

26:47.782 --> 26:49.260
Just find him and you'll see.

26:51.391 --> 26:56.043
Just... find him.

26:56.086 --> 26:57.391
Please?

27:05.869 --> 27:07.260
[door opens]

27:19.130 --> 27:20.304
[door closes]

27:22.478 --> 27:24.478
Why didn't you tell
her I was here?

27:24.521 --> 27:25.739
Why didn't you?

27:25.782 --> 27:29.304
Diane and I were still married
in '04.

27:29.347 --> 27:30.739
I know.

27:30.782 --> 27:34.043
She cheated on me with Victor.

27:34.086 --> 27:37.217
Now we really gotta find
the son of a bitch.

27:37.260 --> 27:38.521
[phone rings]

27:38.565 --> 27:39.521
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

27:39.565 --> 27:41.391
Boss.Yeah, McGee?

27:41.434 --> 27:43.652
I got a break off a cell
from one of the dead gunmen.

27:43.695 --> 27:46.173
Got a location
on the last call it made.Where?

27:46.217 --> 27:47.826
It's an abandoned warehouse
in Anacostia.

27:47.869 --> 27:49.000
Tony's on his way.

27:50.043 --> 27:51.173
No, no, no!

27:51.217 --> 27:52.565
You're driving. Come on.

27:52.608 --> 27:54.608
Let's go.

Data Storage Coordinator,
Department of Homeland Security!

28:43.739 --> 28:46.521
Leroy?

28:48.173 --> 28:49.217
Tobias?

28:54.347 --> 28:56.304
VICTOR:
Thank God.

28:56.347 --> 28:58.782
FORNELL: It's a hell of
a rat trap, Jethro.

28:58.826 --> 29:00.739
VICTOR:
Yeah. They got me chained.

29:01.956 --> 29:03.956
Whew.

29:09.652 --> 29:11.739
Not too bad for two guys
who missed the wedding.

29:11.782 --> 29:14.434
BOTH:
Work.

29:14.478 --> 29:16.304
You're forgiven. Thank you.

29:16.347 --> 29:18.000
Hey!

29:22.000 --> 29:23.695
Get over here,
Leroy.

29:23.739 --> 29:25.434
Hey, hey, hey.

29:27.869 --> 29:31.739
VICTOR:
Why exactly am I being debriefed
in an interrogation room?

29:36.217 --> 29:37.652
Okay, I can,
I can explain that.

29:37.695 --> 29:39.782
Oh, you got a lot of explaining
to do, Lucy.

29:39.826 --> 29:41.043
They told me
if I didn't get their virus,

29:41.086 --> 29:42.826
they would kill Diane.Who?

29:42.869 --> 29:44.217
I don't know.
I was blindfolded.

29:44.260 --> 29:46.478
They tell you
to commit murder, too?

29:46.521 --> 29:48.043
Come on, guys, I'm being set up!

29:48.086 --> 29:50.347
They made it look like
I staged my own kidnapping.

29:50.391 --> 29:52.000
Kept me alive
so I could be the fall guy.

29:52.043 --> 29:53.260
You can't see that?

29:53.304 --> 29:54.913
What I see is a career
bureaucrat who's got

29:54.956 --> 29:56.434
way too much money in the bank.

29:56.478 --> 29:57.695
Most of it hidden offshore.

29:57.739 --> 29:59.608
In the Caymans,
where you like to take a lot

29:59.652 --> 30:01.869
of vacations...
with other people's wives!

30:03.086 --> 30:05.782
Oh, is that what this is about?

30:05.826 --> 30:07.826
Hey, sit down.No, I won't sit down!

30:07.869 --> 30:09.869
VICTOR: You guys had your chance
with Diane and you blew it!

30:09.913 --> 30:10.913
This has nothing to
do with me or her.

30:10.956 --> 30:12.478
And I had nothing
to do with that!

30:12.521 --> 30:14.347
McGEE: Mrs. Sterling!Sit down or I'll
make you sit down!

30:14.391 --> 30:17.043
Ma'am...Back off, Macaulay!
Get the hell away from him!

30:17.086 --> 30:18.782
Boss, I'm sorry.
I tried to stop her.

30:18.826 --> 30:20.652
Diane, I am so glad to see you.

30:20.695 --> 30:22.739
You get the hell away from me!
$2 million dollars?

30:22.782 --> 30:26.391
And I've been worried about how
we're gonna pay the mortgage?

30:26.434 --> 30:27.869
You're on your own.

30:27.913 --> 30:29.652
DIANE:
Well?

30:29.695 --> 30:32.217
It's family money.

30:32.260 --> 30:34.478
I inherited it years ago,
long before we met.

30:34.521 --> 30:36.521
Keep talking.

30:36.565 --> 30:37.869
When you have a lot of money,

30:37.913 --> 30:39.695
it's hard to tell
who your friends are.

30:39.739 --> 30:41.260
And with women,
it's even harder.

30:41.304 --> 30:43.043
So I took the cash

30:43.086 --> 30:45.043
and I invested it
and I forgot about it.

30:45.086 --> 30:46.434
It's our nest egg, baby.

30:46.478 --> 30:48.217
I was gonna surprise you
when I retired.

30:48.260 --> 30:49.347
So, basically,

30:49.391 --> 30:50.478
you couldn't believe

30:50.521 --> 30:52.130
that I would love you
if you were rich?

30:52.173 --> 30:55.782
You didn't trust me,
but you married me anyway?!

30:55.826 --> 30:57.739
I am gonna make
your life a living hell!

31:01.391 --> 31:02.956
Diane,

31:03.000 --> 31:04.826
I'm okay, baby.

31:06.086 --> 31:07.304
I'm safe now.

31:07.347 --> 31:09.956
[sobbing]:
I was so scared!

31:10.000 --> 31:11.608
It's okay, okay.

31:11.652 --> 31:12.782
It's okay.

31:12.826 --> 31:14.043
VICTOR:
It's okay.

31:14.086 --> 31:16.043
Oh, Diane,
I love you so much.

31:16.086 --> 31:17.608
Oh, I love you so much.

31:17.652 --> 31:19.043
You all right?

31:19.086 --> 31:20.217
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

31:20.260 --> 31:21.217
Okay.

31:22.478 --> 31:23.608
Okay, Don Juan.

31:23.652 --> 31:25.434
I'm going to be fine.

31:25.478 --> 31:27.608
If you're not selling the virus,
then who is?

31:27.652 --> 31:29.652
Selling it?
I thought you guys knew.

31:29.695 --> 31:30.913
We knew what?

31:30.956 --> 31:32.652
They're not planning on
selling the virus.

31:32.695 --> 31:34.173
They're planning on using it.

31:44.043 --> 31:46.043
Thank God you're all right.

31:46.086 --> 31:48.086
And I want to let you know
that you're gonna

31:48.130 --> 31:49.217
be getting overtime
for this entire ordeal.

31:49.260 --> 31:51.043
Sit.
VANCE:
I've alerted SecNav.

31:51.086 --> 31:53.304
Agent David said you think
the attack's today.

31:53.347 --> 31:54.000
Are you sure?

31:54.043 --> 31:57.000
Go on, tell him.

31:57.043 --> 32:00.130
There was the brains of an old
LX 57433-X in the storage room

32:00.173 --> 32:02.652
where they were keeping me.A what?

32:02.695 --> 32:04.695
It's an old office voicemail
system from the '90s.

32:04.739 --> 32:07.043
I was in charge of requisitions
for the CBO in '97,

32:07.086 --> 32:09.391
so I was familiar...Cut to the chase.

32:09.434 --> 32:11.043
I was able to use the 433-X

32:11.086 --> 32:13.043
to patch
into an old intercom panel.

32:13.086 --> 32:15.391
I could just make out one of
my captors talking to someone.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.043
Warning them
to stay indoors today.

32:17.086 --> 32:19.043
With a deadly virus,
that can only mean one thing.

32:19.086 --> 32:20.782
Any idea what the target is?

32:20.826 --> 32:21.608
[phone ringing]No.

32:21.652 --> 32:23.347
Yeah, Abbs, go ahead.

32:23.391 --> 32:25.086
ABBY: I might have a lead
on their target.I'll be right down.

32:25.130 --> 32:26.956
Abby thinks she has a lead.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
Go. I'll call SecNav back.

32:28.043 --> 32:29.782
Mr. Pearce,
you hit Homeland.

32:29.826 --> 32:31.260
Fornell, FBI.Got it.

32:32.608 --> 32:34.347
Hi.
Hey.

32:34.391 --> 32:36.000
I got a lead on
the conversation

32:36.043 --> 32:37.086
that Victor overheard.

32:37.130 --> 32:38.739
This is the old phone
that he used

32:38.782 --> 32:40.913
to MacGyver into
the intercom system.

32:40.956 --> 32:43.391
It converts analog signals
into digital ones,

32:43.434 --> 32:45.043
and then it stores it
briefly in RAM...

32:45.086 --> 32:47.000
Abbs, I don't care.
What do you got?

32:47.043 --> 32:48.608
I was able to pull
the last few seconds

32:48.652 --> 32:50.043
of the conversation.

32:50.086 --> 32:52.130
MAN:
Stay indoors tomorrow
and as far away from...

32:52.173 --> 32:53.652
So, whatever it is,
tomorrow is today.

32:53.695 --> 32:54.652
Yeah, we know.

32:54.695 --> 32:55.913
There's more.

32:55.956 --> 32:57.608
...and as far away from
the game as you can.

32:57.652 --> 32:58.608
"The game."

32:58.652 --> 33:00.086
I searched the Google,

33:00.130 --> 33:02.173
and there's only
one in town today.

33:02.217 --> 33:03.173
Armed Forces Football Game.

33:03.217 --> 33:04.391
Yeah, biggest
one of the year.

33:04.434 --> 33:05.913
There'll be, like,
60,000 people there.

33:05.956 --> 33:08.086
Virus is spread by touch;
they can't hit them all.

33:08.130 --> 33:09.782
Oh, I'm not so
sure, Gibbs.

33:09.826 --> 33:11.739
This was found in the warehouse
where Victor was held.

33:11.782 --> 33:13.173
It's used to...

33:13.217 --> 33:15.000
Powderize milk. My uncle had
one of these on his farm.

33:15.043 --> 33:17.000
Of course he did.

33:17.043 --> 33:20.043
Anyways, it's clean now, but I
found traces of the virus in it,

33:20.086 --> 33:22.217
so we have to assume that
it's also been powderized.

33:22.260 --> 33:23.434
Which means?Which means that

33:23.478 --> 33:24.956
it's transmissible
by air now.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.956
Every single person at that
stadium is at risk, Gibbs.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
Got it, Abbs. Thanks.

33:29.260 --> 33:32.043
ANNOUNCER:
Welcome to the 2011

33:32.086 --> 33:35.000
Armed Forces Football Game,
the annual charity event

33:35.043 --> 33:38.000
which brings together all five
branches of the military.

33:38.043 --> 33:39.217
This year the Armed Forces

33:39.260 --> 33:41.869
also has to take on
Monroe University.

33:41.913 --> 33:46.000
[voice trailing off]:
Dignitaries and officials
of all branches...

33:56.652 --> 33:57.826
Three minutes to kickoff.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.173
Yes, sir.
Right this way.

33:59.217 --> 34:00.434
It's not too late
to evacuate.

34:00.478 --> 34:02.043
We evacuate, they
release the virus.

34:02.086 --> 34:02.956
Come on through.
Right through here.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.217
Yes, sir.
Come on through.

34:04.260 --> 34:06.043
McGEE:
Abby says we're
looking for

34:06.086 --> 34:07.173
a pressurized container,

34:07.217 --> 34:08.565
should be in a
public place.

34:08.608 --> 34:09.565
DiNozzo, McGee.

34:09.608 --> 34:10.695
Sweeping the tunnel.

34:10.739 --> 34:11.652
On it, boss.

34:17.130 --> 34:18.478
[applause]

34:18.521 --> 34:21.521
[band playing
"The Star-Spangled Banner"]

34:40.217 --> 34:42.217
[jet engines roaring]

34:46.260 --> 34:47.652
[phone ringing]

34:47.695 --> 34:48.695
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

34:48.739 --> 34:49.608
Gibbs, we have a problem.

34:49.652 --> 34:51.217
Figured.

34:51.260 --> 34:52.608
I finished processing the virus
on the powderizing machine.

34:52.652 --> 34:54.608
There's not enough
for a large-scale attack,

34:54.652 --> 34:56.565
only, like, a few dozen people.

34:56.608 --> 34:58.217
Maybe we were wrong
about the location.

34:58.260 --> 34:59.739
We're not.Nothing here,
either, McGee.

34:59.782 --> 35:01.695
Give me that.

35:01.739 --> 35:02.739
Hey, McGee.

35:02.782 --> 35:04.695
VIP list--
who's at the game today?

35:04.739 --> 35:06.652
Hang on, boss. Checking.

35:08.478 --> 35:10.086
A lot of bigwigs.

35:10.130 --> 35:11.565
Luxury box is filled
with top brass

35:11.608 --> 35:12.869
from all five
military services.

35:12.913 --> 35:15.478
GIBBS: Boxes. Got it.

35:15.521 --> 35:17.434
Got to be our target.

35:17.478 --> 35:19.478
Gibbs.

35:24.130 --> 35:25.000
Ziva.

35:28.478 --> 35:31.478
ANNOUNCER:
All-Stars kick off,
and we're under way.

35:35.521 --> 35:36.695
Check him.

35:44.739 --> 35:46.521
GIBBS:
Hey, what do you see?

35:46.565 --> 35:48.565
FORNELL:
Two of them-- 30 yards.

35:48.608 --> 35:49.782
Working the vents.

35:51.826 --> 35:53.565
Ready?

35:55.608 --> 35:57.913
Condom underneath
the fold?

35:57.956 --> 36:00.130
Really, Tobias?

36:00.173 --> 36:02.000
Same one I had in college.

36:02.043 --> 36:03.608
I never used it.

36:03.652 --> 36:05.608
Just like what it represents.

36:05.652 --> 36:07.652
Hope?

36:30.565 --> 36:31.956
GIBBS:
Pearce!

36:32.000 --> 36:33.130
NCIS!

36:33.173 --> 36:34.043
FBI!

36:55.260 --> 36:56.652
Now!

37:24.086 --> 37:26.130
FORNELL:
Homeland Security.

37:26.173 --> 37:27.173
Son of a bitch.

37:27.217 --> 37:29.652
Congratulations.

37:29.695 --> 37:30.739
[panting]

37:32.086 --> 37:33.652
But you haven't done
anything here today.

37:35.565 --> 37:37.913
You don't even know
what you're fighting for.

37:40.956 --> 37:42.782
[last gasping breath]

37:45.956 --> 37:49.739
Suddenly I'm not feeling
very homelandy or secure.

37:53.913 --> 37:55.565
VANCE:
I want answers.

37:55.608 --> 37:56.782
A Homeland Security employee

37:56.826 --> 37:58.521
just tried to commit
an act of terrorism.

37:58.565 --> 38:00.826
Not a terrorist attack, Leon,
just supposed to look like one.

38:00.869 --> 38:02.521
It was a targeted
assassination.Who?

38:02.565 --> 38:04.391
Our top military policy makers.

38:04.434 --> 38:05.913
All in town
to preside over

38:05.956 --> 38:08.608
a massive drawdown
of our military forces.

38:08.652 --> 38:10.000
Got a hit list

38:10.043 --> 38:11.478
off Pearce's computer.

38:11.521 --> 38:12.565
Who was he working for?

38:12.608 --> 38:13.695
Good question.

38:13.739 --> 38:15.391
With billions at stake,
a lot of guys

38:15.434 --> 38:16.652
don't want to see
that drawdown happen.

38:16.695 --> 38:18.478
Guys like these.

38:18.521 --> 38:21.173
McGee found contacts with all
of them on Pearce's computer.

38:21.217 --> 38:22.652
Doesn't mean
they're involved.

38:22.695 --> 38:24.260
But it's a good
bet our bad guy

38:24.304 --> 38:25.260
is on this list.

38:25.304 --> 38:26.478
Someone must have
promised Pearce

38:26.521 --> 38:28.043
quite a cozy position

38:28.086 --> 38:29.695
when he moved to
the private sector.

38:29.739 --> 38:31.739
Beware the
military-industrial complex.

38:31.782 --> 38:33.434
Next part of
this investigation

38:33.478 --> 38:35.739
is gonna step on a lot of toes.

38:35.782 --> 38:38.043
You left me
a bone sandwich, Gibbs.

38:38.086 --> 38:39.608
I cut the crust off for you.

38:39.652 --> 38:41.608
FBI does have the lead.

38:41.652 --> 38:42.913
Good luck, Agent Fornell.

38:42.956 --> 38:43.956
Thanks.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.130
Ah, cheer up, Tobias.

38:46.173 --> 38:48.565
At least you'll never have
to talk to Diane again.

38:48.608 --> 38:50.043
I have a child with her.

38:50.086 --> 38:51.043
Oh, that's right.

38:51.086 --> 38:53.000
Guess I won't
have to.

39:02.391 --> 39:04.043
I'm out of bourbon.

39:04.086 --> 39:06.043
[chuckles]
I didn't come
for a nightcap.

39:18.608 --> 39:20.521
[sighs]

39:20.565 --> 39:23.347
I know you used to come down
here to avoid me, Leroy.

39:23.391 --> 39:25.000
I didn't mean to hurt you.

39:25.043 --> 39:26.086
I know.

39:28.086 --> 39:30.391
I wasn't the easiest
person to live with.

39:30.434 --> 39:33.478
I'll agree with that.

39:35.521 --> 39:37.260
Thank you for
finding Victor.

39:39.304 --> 39:42.043
He saved a lot of people.

39:42.086 --> 39:43.782
Good man.

39:44.565 --> 39:46.826
Would you...

39:46.869 --> 39:49.956
tell Tobias that I never
meant to hurt him?

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Oh, yeah, he knows.

39:53.782 --> 39:54.956
I think.

39:55.000 --> 39:58.869
I really liked him.

39:58.913 --> 40:00.826
But I never should
have married him.

40:00.869 --> 40:02.869
I didn't love him.

40:05.086 --> 40:08.434
Just like you
never loved me.

40:10.478 --> 40:13.434
I liked you.

40:13.478 --> 40:14.826
I still do.

40:17.478 --> 40:20.043
But the only woman you'll
ever love is Shannon.

40:41.260 --> 40:43.043
You were my
Shannon, Leroy.
