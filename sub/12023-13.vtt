10:53.742 --> 10:55.275
Come on, baby.

10:55.277 --> 10:57.344
Fuck!

11:03.785 --> 11:08.322
Not very happy right now.

11:10.692 --> 11:17.064
Slowed down way too much, and, uh,
ended up sliding on the road.

11:17.066 --> 11:20.467
25 mile is one of those--"in a
pickle" hills is what I call it

11:20.469 --> 11:23.337
because of the fact that, you
know, if you get stuck in

11:23.339 --> 11:26.039
the middle of the road, yeah,
maybe northbound traffic, they

11:26.041 --> 11:28.809
can see you, but the southbound
traffic coming over the hill

11:28.811 --> 11:31.178
can't see you until they're
already committed to the corner.

11:31.180 --> 11:36.183
So you could get hit and die, or, I mean,
get pushed off the side of the bank.

11:36.185 --> 11:37.451
We were blocking both lanes.

11:37.453 --> 11:39.787
It's a dangerous
corner to be on.

11:39.789 --> 11:43.223
Narrator: Only 100 miles into the
trip, the steepest stretches

11:43.225 --> 11:46.160
of the Dalton are still ahead.

11:46.162 --> 11:52.366
No matter how many times you spin out
on that hill, it's always dangerous.

11:54.502 --> 11:57.805
Narrator: - Back at the Carlile yard...
- Oh, we'll go see what I've

11:57.807 --> 11:59.139
got for a load today.

11:59.141 --> 12:01.608
Narrator: Darrell Ward's
returning to the road after a

12:01.610 --> 12:04.578
breakdown threw him off
the load count lead.

12:04.580 --> 12:05.946
This is your trip.

12:05.948 --> 12:07.214
You've got a load of long pipe.

12:07.216 --> 12:08.048
Oh, right on.

12:08.050 --> 12:10.551
And you'll hook up to her, and
your pilot car should be

12:10.553 --> 12:13.053
meeting you over there
about 8:30 or so.

12:13.055 --> 12:15.155
Okay, I'll be on my way.

12:15.157 --> 12:15.856
Roger that.

12:15.858 --> 12:16.590
All right, thanks, Mark.

12:16.592 --> 12:18.125
See ya.

12:18.127 --> 12:19.693
My alternator's out on my truck.

12:19.695 --> 12:22.429
My truck went in the shop and
got full service, and, uh-- you

12:22.431 --> 12:26.767
know, I got a load of long pipe going
north, and I'm on the road again.

12:26.769 --> 12:29.169
Narrator: But his return to
the haul road will be his

12:29.171 --> 12:31.405
biggest challenge yet.

12:31.407 --> 12:35.242
Today, Darrell's been trusted
with long pipe, one of the

12:35.244 --> 12:40.781
toughest loads on the Dalton.

12:40.783 --> 12:43.550
45 below zero here.

12:43.552 --> 12:46.587
Hope this truck doesn't
give me any problems today.

12:46.589 --> 12:50.123
Narrator: And with the cold
weather shutdown looming,

12:50.125 --> 12:52.960
Darrell's got no time to waste.

12:52.962 --> 12:59.833
Make sure everything's
good and roll on.

12:59.835 --> 13:02.302
Darrell, you copy?

13:02.304 --> 13:04.872
Yes, sir.

13:04.874 --> 13:07.307
Southbound, dropping
off back here.

13:07.309 --> 13:09.276
Copy that.

13:09.278 --> 13:12.880
Narrator: Pilot driver John
Grimes is out ahead...

13:12.882 --> 13:15.582
Southbound, got long
pipe coming up there.

13:15.584 --> 13:17.384
[Indistinct].

13:17.386 --> 13:21.989
Narrator: Warning oncoming traffic
to steer clear of the 85-foot load.

13:21.991 --> 13:25.058
Northbound, I have a
car backing off here.

13:25.060 --> 13:26.793
Thanks, bud.

13:26.795 --> 13:30.197
You betcha.

13:30.199 --> 13:32.466
[Beep, beep, beep]

13:33.736 --> 13:36.536
Narrator: But just 20 miles
out of town... [Beeping]

13:36.538 --> 13:38.105
What the hell?

13:38.107 --> 13:41.275
What the fuck
we got going here?

13:41.277 --> 13:44.411
Narrator: Warning lights show
the engine is de-rating, which

13:44.413 --> 13:48.849
means the truck isn't running at
full strength, and Darrell's

13:48.851 --> 13:52.786
got less horsepower to get
the long pipe up the road.

13:52.788 --> 13:56.189
When an engine de-rates,
you'll be pulling hard, it'll

13:56.191 --> 13:58.358
fucking de-rate itself
right instantly.

13:58.360 --> 14:01.261
It doesn't, like,
gradually start doing it.

14:01.263 --> 14:05.165
When it does it, you'll be going along
and just boom, you're de-rated.

14:05.167 --> 14:07.601
Narrator: Darrell's got to
decide whether to play it safe

14:07.603 --> 14:10.704
and head back to the shop...
[Beeping]

14:10.706 --> 14:13.874
This fucking blows, dude.

14:13.876 --> 14:16.643
Narrator: Or hope the horsepower
he has left is enough

14:16.645 --> 14:18.712
to get him to Prudhoe Bay.

14:18.714 --> 14:21.949
Just want to make this run and
get back in the load count,

14:21.951 --> 14:24.551
whatever it takes, you know?

14:24.553 --> 14:28.522
Narrator: And he makes the
call to roll the dice.

14:28.524 --> 14:33.627
Gotta keep the load moving.

14:33.629 --> 14:36.763
Narrator: In the heart of
Canada's rural outback, on the

14:36.765 --> 14:40.801
- Dempster highway....
- I'm through the Gorge.

14:40.803 --> 14:43.503
I'm almost to James Creek.

14:43.505 --> 14:47.574
Alex Debogorski is racing to the
James Creek DOT Camp on a

14:47.576 --> 14:50.610
critical mission for the
people of the north.

14:50.612 --> 14:55.248
Every day the road's down is one
less day to work, so every

14:55.250 --> 15:01.154
day we can keep it open, the better
for me, the better for the company.

15:01.156 --> 15:03.690
Narrator: Heavy snowfall has
the road closed at Hurricane

15:03.692 --> 15:07.461
Alley, cutting off the only
lifeline to Canada's Arctic

15:07.463 --> 15:12.165
communities, and Alex is
delivering the snow blower

15:12.167 --> 15:16.703
the DOT needs to reopen the road.

15:16.705 --> 15:19.072
It's been a bad winter for
the transportation industry

15:19.074 --> 15:22.609
here because the road has been
closed as much as it's been open.

15:22.611 --> 15:26.079
So, the idea is to keep it open
as long as possible, and as much

15:26.081 --> 15:31.585
of the time as possible, so the
freight gets hauled through.

15:31.587 --> 15:34.321
'Cause pretty soon here the
road's gonna be closed because

15:34.323 --> 15:36.056
the ice bridges are gonna go.

15:36.058 --> 15:39.659
The rivers will start breaking
up, and that means the road is

15:39.661 --> 15:43.630
finished.

15:49.871 --> 15:56.443
Well, here's James
Creek in the distance.

15:56.445 --> 15:58.345
Okay.

15:58.347 --> 16:04.451
What's the chance of
finding anybody here?

16:12.560 --> 16:16.163
Untie it?

16:20.468 --> 16:22.069
You got her.

16:22.071 --> 16:25.238
Narrator: But Alex's day
is just getting started.

16:25.240 --> 16:26.673
Son of a gun, look at that.

16:26.675 --> 16:28.708
[Laughs]

16:28.710 --> 16:31.044
Narrator: Now he's got a heavy
duty loader headed for

16:31.046 --> 16:35.348
crews in Inuvik.

16:35.350 --> 16:39.219
Figure this one's tight enough.

16:39.221 --> 16:42.756
I'd say that thing is pushing
60,000 pounds, if anything,

16:42.758 --> 16:44.958
maybe 50,000.

16:44.960 --> 16:45.625
Should be a good load.

16:45.627 --> 16:46.860
It's gonna be fully loaded.

16:46.862 --> 16:50.397
Narrator: The road's closed until
the DOT can get their

16:50.399 --> 16:54.067
gear, it's up to
Alex to get it done.

16:54.069 --> 16:56.236
Okay. Boom-boom.

16:56.238 --> 16:59.139
Here we go again.

16:59.141 --> 17:06.179
Narrator: 1,700 miles to the southeast...
[Engine chugs]

17:06.181 --> 17:11.084
We got a 57-something-foot shack
we're hauling to Winnipeg.

17:11.086 --> 17:15.088
Narrator: Still hours ahead of
Rick, Hugh's doubling down.

17:15.089 --> 17:17.290
She's a little long for my
trailer, but I'll put her on

17:17.291 --> 17:19.960
there and-- may have to move my
fifth wheel ahead so I've got

17:19.962 --> 17:21.361
some weight on her.

17:21.363 --> 17:24.263
Weight on my truck,
so I don't spin out.

17:24.266 --> 17:26.398
Narrator: Under pressure to
get in as many loads as

17:26.401 --> 17:30.871
possible, he's found a
backhaul bound for Winnipeg.

17:30.873 --> 17:34.774
It's a 50-foot shack on a-- I
think it's a 43-foot step

17:34.776 --> 17:37.444
deck, so we got 10 feet
overhang, probably.

17:37.446 --> 17:38.979
I got no weight on the
back of my truck.

17:38.981 --> 17:39.980
It's all on the ass end.

17:39.982 --> 17:42.849
It's gonna be bouncing down the
road, so gonna have to be

17:42.851 --> 17:48.054
careful and watch it.

17:51.058 --> 17:54.294
Narrator: Locked and loaded,
Hugh rolls out with his second

17:54.296 --> 17:58.231
load of the day.

17:58.233 --> 18:04.437
And there's still no sign of
convoy partner Rick Yemm.

18:08.876 --> 18:11.044
Hey, where's your partner?

18:11.046 --> 18:14.614
Yeah, where's Rick?

18:14.616 --> 18:16.149
Where's Rick?

18:16.151 --> 18:16.816
I'm not sure.

18:16.818 --> 18:19.052
He either found a little honey up
there, or he found a watering

18:19.054 --> 18:20.320
hole, whatever it is.

18:20.322 --> 18:22.689
'Cause he ain't
behind me no more.

18:22.691 --> 18:25.859
He's lost in action.

18:25.861 --> 18:28.862
[Air horn blares]

18:28.864 --> 18:33.233
Narrator: While Hugh heads
out with his next haul...

18:37.271 --> 18:41.408
Rick's just pulling
in to offload.

18:41.410 --> 18:45.979
Well, things got a little screwed
up today with me and Hugh there.

18:45.981 --> 18:47.814
So Hugh just went ahead.

18:47.816 --> 18:51.885
Narrator: And he's still fuming about
being ditched by the Polar Bear.

18:51.887 --> 18:55.689
And how many more ways can I
say that this is fucked up?

18:55.691 --> 18:57.857
I don't know how
things got messed up.

18:57.859 --> 19:01.161
I'll tell you, I've seen some stuff
here, I just shake my fucking head.

19:01.163 --> 19:02.629
We come up here,
we do this job.

19:02.631 --> 19:04.564
It's kind of what the whole
purpose of traveling together

19:04.566 --> 19:08.535
was, but sometimes it
doesn't go that way.

19:08.537 --> 19:10.237
I don't run solo.

19:10.239 --> 19:11.938
[Crash]

19:11.940 --> 19:13.873
Never, ever liked
being mistreated.

19:13.875 --> 19:15.141
Now it ends.

19:15.143 --> 19:18.511
See what's gonna happen now.

19:25.796 --> 19:31.400
Narrator: - In Alaska...
- See, all this lumber's

19:31.402 --> 19:33.836
probably the most important
part I got here.

19:33.838 --> 19:37.173
Once it gets to Prudhoe, it's
still got a long trip to go

19:37.175 --> 19:39.508
before it gets delivered.

19:39.510 --> 19:42.211
Narrator: Jack Jessee's
racing north before

19:42.213 --> 19:47.149
extreme temperatures
shut down Prudhoe Bay.

19:47.151 --> 19:50.052
You may not think lumber could
be all that important, but

19:50.054 --> 19:52.154
they don't have any lumber mills
up there, and there's definitely

19:52.156 --> 19:53.422
no Home Depot.

19:53.424 --> 19:57.660
Everything they get
comes out of Fairbanks.

19:57.662 --> 19:59.395
The temperature's dropping.

19:59.397 --> 20:03.032
Hopefully we can beat the
cold weather shutdown.

20:03.034 --> 20:03.966
Sometimes you never know.

20:03.968 --> 20:08.571
Sometimes a few minutes
can make the difference.

20:08.573 --> 20:12.141
Narrator: If Jack can't
make it in time...

20:12.143 --> 20:18.414
He won't able to deliver
this load to the oil fields.

20:26.290 --> 20:28.491
What's going on here?

20:28.493 --> 20:31.027
I don't know.

20:31.029 --> 20:33.462
What the hell?

20:33.464 --> 20:41.103
Is that chain loose, or-- uh-oh.
I'm about to lose the pickup.

20:41.105 --> 20:46.309
I'm gonna have to
stop pretty quick.

20:46.311 --> 20:49.679
This could be a
serious problem.

20:55.018 --> 20:59.655
Let's see what we
got going on here.

20:59.657 --> 21:03.592
Yup, yup, that one got loose,
and that one got loose.

21:03.594 --> 21:06.195
Now I gotta go tighten these.

21:06.197 --> 21:09.198
This was just starting
to wor-- get even worse.

21:09.200 --> 21:12.968
These chains get too loose and
pickup bounces around a lot,

21:12.970 --> 21:14.403
it can snap the chain.

21:14.405 --> 21:16.839
All the jarring and
jerking, it'll snap it.

21:16.841 --> 21:22.478
Man, this [Coughs]-- this load
is just driving me nuts.

21:22.480 --> 21:25.948
Narrator: The load's
re-secured, but every second

21:25.950 --> 21:31.087
counts in the race
against mother nature.

21:31.089 --> 21:33.022
So we're gonna hammer
down to Prudhoe.

21:33.024 --> 21:39.762
'Cause it's getting cold up there, and
I've got to get this load up there.

21:39.764 --> 21:44.333
Narrator: While Jack tries
to make up for lost time...

21:44.335 --> 21:46.102
So far she's looking good.

21:46.104 --> 21:48.404
Roads seem to be in
pretty good condition.

21:48.406 --> 21:51.407
Narrator: Porkchop's also
heading north, with a 50,000-

21:51.409 --> 21:57.113
pound van trailer, unaware
that just behind him...

21:57.115 --> 21:59.181
Caught up to Porkchop there.

21:59.183 --> 22:02.752
Narrator: Trainer Phil Kromm
is watching every move.

22:02.754 --> 22:06.689
I feel like a double agent,
running covert operations, just

22:06.691 --> 22:10.292
kind of shadowing along behind.

22:10.294 --> 22:12.361
I don't know what
his problem is.

22:12.363 --> 22:16.098
It's looking to me like he's
rolling off the hills too fast.

22:16.100 --> 22:20.836
He just seems to be
foot flat on the floor.

22:20.838 --> 22:23.939
That's not a good sign.

22:23.941 --> 22:27.309
I think he may be actually
cracking under the pressure.

22:27.311 --> 22:32.915
He's struggled a bit out
here, and we're concerned.

22:32.917 --> 22:37.119
Narrator: But as both trucks
round the next bend...

22:37.121 --> 22:39.455
Are you back there, Phil?

22:39.457 --> 22:45.161
Narrator: Porkchop
sees his shadow.

22:47.864 --> 22:50.833
Everybody's always getting
"Porkchopped," it's Porkchop's

22:50.835 --> 22:52.802
turn to get "Philled."

22:52.804 --> 22:55.905
So, I'm gonna find me a little
pull-off up here and I'm gonna

22:55.907 --> 22:59.241
hide, and I'm gonna have
a little bit of fun.

22:59.243 --> 23:05.114
Narrator: His plan, step on the
gas, find a place to hide,

23:05.116 --> 23:07.583
and let Phil go by.

23:07.585 --> 23:09.318
He just keeps pulling away.

23:09.320 --> 23:11.420
I can't seem to keep up.

23:11.422 --> 23:14.390
Narrator: But Porkchop's got
no idea the guy he's messing

23:14.392 --> 23:19.361
with holds his
fate in his hands.

23:19.363 --> 23:22.531
Well, I hope I gain a little
bit of respect out of

23:22.533 --> 23:23.899
Phil for it, we'll see.

23:23.901 --> 23:29.705
That's all we can do.

23:29.707 --> 23:36.679
Well, I-I kind of suspect
Porkchop knows I'm back here.

23:36.681 --> 23:38.314
I'm gonna hide and wait for him
to pass, and then I'm gonna

38:14.666 --> 38:17.500
Well, she's got a fuel
problem, all right.

38:17.502 --> 38:20.170
Let me see if I can drain the
water out of the filter.

38:20.172 --> 38:21.905
Then hopefully
it'll run better.

38:21.907 --> 38:23.807
I hope that's all it is.

38:23.809 --> 38:27.243
Doesn't take very much water in
these filters to plug 'em up.

38:27.245 --> 38:29.412
If it ain't one thing,
it's another.

38:29.414 --> 38:35.885
This fucking truck, all it's been
doing is giving me problems.

38:35.887 --> 38:43.860
Narrator: Pumping water from the fuel
line should help the de-rating engine.

38:43.862 --> 38:48.364
It's not a permanent fix, but it might
be enough to get him back underway.

38:48.366 --> 38:49.866
I think I got it.

38:49.868 --> 38:51.000
Sounds a lot better, man.

38:51.002 --> 38:54.037
It's hitting on all
cylinders again.

38:54.039 --> 38:58.608
I'll go ahead and go.

38:58.610 --> 39:01.444
Well, she seems to be
running all right now.

39:01.446 --> 39:03.980
Got my fuel filters
drained out.

39:03.982 --> 39:09.719
Let's hope I got
her taken care of.

39:09.721 --> 39:15.625
Narrator: - 180 miles to the north...
- We got this lumber on here,

39:15.627 --> 39:17.861
and it's pretty important.

39:17.863 --> 39:20.063
I've got a time schedule,
I have to meet on, man.

39:20.065 --> 39:22.899
Narrator: Jack Jessee's
trying to reach Prudhoe Bay

39:22.901 --> 39:27.337
before the temperature
hits 50 below.

39:27.339 --> 39:30.340
I'm worried about a cold weather
shutdown going on up there.

39:30.342 --> 39:34.711
Hopefully I can get there before the weather
gets, sets in and gets really cold.

39:34.713 --> 39:36.045
But I can only drive so fast.

39:36.047 --> 39:37.580
I can only do so much.

39:37.582 --> 39:39.983
Gotta keep our fingers
crossed on this one.

39:39.985 --> 39:41.484
This is mother nature's deal.

39:41.486 --> 39:46.956
It's out of my control.

39:46.958 --> 39:49.159
You know, it's a
pretty rush load here.

39:49.161 --> 39:54.964
I'm starting to feel the
pressure of getting it up.

40:01.005 --> 40:04.974
Narrator: But as lights break
through the darkness...

40:04.976 --> 40:06.609
We're just coming into Prudhoe.

40:06.611 --> 40:08.411
About 50 below here.

40:08.413 --> 40:11.114
Place is a ghost
town right now.

40:11.116 --> 40:12.882
Narrator: It's not looking good.

40:12.884 --> 40:15.852
I'm sure they're in shutdown.

40:15.854 --> 40:18.755
Hell, I'd be in shutdown.

40:18.757 --> 40:21.791
Well, I'm kind of feeling
a little letdown.

40:21.793 --> 40:24.227
Well, there was nothing really
I could have done about it.

40:24.229 --> 40:25.161
The weather is the weather.

40:25.163 --> 40:26.496
Nobody can control it.

40:26.498 --> 40:29.966
Just deal with what you've got.

40:29.968 --> 40:33.503
I would have liked to have got
in there before they shut down.

40:33.505 --> 40:36.840
Man, this looks like an
apocalypse out here.

40:36.842 --> 40:39.142
There ain't nothing
gonna happen.

40:39.144 --> 40:41.110
Narrator: It means this
load won't reach its final

40:41.112 --> 40:44.314
destination until the
shutdown is lifted.

40:44.316 --> 40:47.684
Basically, we'll get into the
yard tonight, unhook my trailer,

40:47.686 --> 40:51.154
and when it warms up and they can do
something with it, that's what they'll do.

40:51.156 --> 40:55.692
Narrator: And there'll be no
backhaul for the haul road ace.

40:55.694 --> 40:59.128
There's really nothing
I can do now.

40:59.130 --> 41:04.601
It's too cold to do
anything outside.

41:04.603 --> 41:07.237
I'm just gonna go to bed.

41:07.239 --> 41:09.772
Narrator: Despite
the shutdown...

41:11.008 --> 41:16.179
Jack holds on the top spot in the
load count, while Alex turns

41:16.181 --> 41:23.953
and burns into a tie
for second place.

41:23.955 --> 41:27.390
- In Manitoba...
- She's a little longer.

41:27.392 --> 41:30.493
About 12 feet longer
than what she should be.

41:30.495 --> 41:34.864
Narrator: Hugh's rolling solo with an
oversized shack bound for Winnipeg.

41:34.866 --> 41:37.033
No snow lights, no
trailer brakes.

41:37.035 --> 41:38.401
Minor-- [Truck rattling]

41:38.403 --> 41:42.205
Narrator: On the rapidly
melting winter roads, he's

41:42.207 --> 41:45.341
running out of time to move
cargo and cash in on his

41:45.343 --> 41:48.478
percentage of Polar's profits.

41:48.480 --> 41:50.413
[Laughs]

41:50.415 --> 41:55.485
Getting water showing up.

42:00.224 --> 42:01.491
That's not a good sign.

42:01.493 --> 42:09.232
Fucking water in the middle of the
night, running across the road.

42:09.234 --> 42:13.937
It's been a long day,
but we're makin' her.

42:17.641 --> 42:20.410
There's another
load under my belt.

42:20.412 --> 42:25.415
Well, we'll get to sleep in April,
that's what I always say every year.

42:25.417 --> 42:28.051
Narrator: Hugh's early morning
start scored him the

42:28.053 --> 42:36.759
rare winter roads backhaul...
But it left Rick Yemm alone and behind.

42:36.761 --> 42:37.860
Like, I'm a fucking hothead.

42:37.862 --> 42:39.395
Yeah, I'm a fucking hothead.

42:39.397 --> 42:43.566
But I'm a hothead for a reason.

42:43.568 --> 42:45.468
What? And I was sitting there
fucking stewing on it, and I

42:45.470 --> 42:47.370
thought, "you know what?

42:47.372 --> 42:49.405
I don't give a fuck."

42:49.407 --> 42:53.643
I said I just don't like the
shit that's going on.

42:53.645 --> 42:56.045
And I-- and I'll fucking tell
Hugh, "you're the one who

42:56.047 --> 42:58.948
fucking went right along
with taking off."

42:58.950 --> 43:00.850
Like, this isn't
the first time.

43:00.852 --> 43:02.118
I sat at that fucking

43:02.120 --> 43:05.321
bloodvein turnoff for him for
five fucking hours waiting

43:05.323 --> 43:06.956
for him last year.

43:06.958 --> 43:08.758
'Cause we travel together.

43:08.760 --> 43:10.393
I'm the nice guy out of this.

43:10.395 --> 43:12.028
He doesn't give a fuck.

43:12.030 --> 43:16.766
Make sure Hughy's happy,
but fuck Rick.

43:16.768 --> 43:17.500
Why?

43:17.502 --> 43:19.302
He's the Polar Bear.

43:19.304 --> 43:21.304
He's everybody's fucking hero.

43:21.306 --> 43:24.307
I just hate it, 'cause I bent
over backwards, and I get the

43:24.309 --> 43:26.843
short end of the fucking stick.

43:26.845 --> 43:28.911
Tired of getting pushed around.

43:28.913 --> 43:32.682
Just treat me with
some fucking respect.

43:32.684 --> 43:34.851
Fuck the Polar Bear!

43:34.853 --> 43:37.320
Narrator: Next time, on
<i>Ice Road Truckers...</i>

43:37.322 --> 43:38.654
<i>All right, I'm ready to roll.</i>

43:38.656 --> 43:41.357
<i>I'll be surprised if I</i>
<i>don't</i> win the load count.

43:41.359 --> 43:45.395
Narrator: The battle for the load count
lead leaves a path of destruction.

43:45.397 --> 43:48.031
Oh, fuck!

43:48.033 --> 43:49.866
Maybe they need to come down
to the lower 48, learn

43:49.868 --> 43:51.534
how to drive a real truck.

43:51.536 --> 43:55.571
Narrator: - Some will dig deep...
- I need to get loads, man.

43:55.573 --> 43:57.407
It's all about loads right now.

43:57.409 --> 44:00.009
Narrator: Some will give in...
[Bang, rattle]

44:00.011 --> 44:01.310
Man, did I fucked up here?

44:01.312 --> 44:03.446
That's ten years I've been doing
this, that's the first time I've

44:03.448 --> 44:05.281
lost anything off my load.

44:05.283 --> 44:09.018
Narrator: And others are
just lucky to be alive.

44:09.020 --> 44:11.921
My dangerous goods are
shaking all over.
