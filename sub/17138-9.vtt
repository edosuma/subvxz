20:09.239 --> 20:11.706
the effects, uh, on Rip

20:11.708 --> 20:14.309
since he came in contact with the, um...

20:14.311 --> 20:16.444
[snapping fingers] Time drive.

20:16.446 --> 20:18.079
<i>I've brought up the
time drive's schematics</i>

20:18.081 --> 20:20.882
- <i>for you, Dr. Palmer.</i>
- [laughs]

20:20.884 --> 20:23.218
Well, how do you expect me
to understand any of that?

20:23.220 --> 20:26.187
Uh, maybe using one of your four PhDs?

20:26.189 --> 20:30.458
- I don't have four...
- What's wrong?

20:30.460 --> 20:34.062
It's like I should have
memories that aren't there,

20:34.064 --> 20:37.299
and I should understand
what this is, but I don't.

20:37.301 --> 20:39.901
Yeah, I feel it, too,
it's happening right now.

20:39.903 --> 20:43.004
I'm reading this book about
“Santarion Long-inises,”

20:43.006 --> 20:45.941
and it's just a bunch of words.

20:45.943 --> 20:48.176
How long have the two of
you been feeling like this?

20:48.178 --> 20:50.312
[inhales sharply, exhales slowly]

20:50.314 --> 20:54.182
both: Since, uh... Film set.

20:54.184 --> 20:56.418
- Mr. Hunter's film.
- Mm-hmm.

20:56.420 --> 20:59.654
Sara had Jax go and
recover what he could find.

20:59.656 --> 21:02.290
“Glucas.” Wait, isn't that what

21:02.292 --> 21:03.825
you pretend you're allergic to, Ray?

21:03.827 --> 21:06.561
What? First of all, my gluten allergy

21:06.563 --> 21:08.096
is very real and challenging.

21:08.098 --> 21:12.834
Secondly, it's G. Lucas,
as in George Lucas.

21:12.836 --> 21:14.536
Wait. George Lucas.

21:14.538 --> 21:16.605
How do I know that name?

21:16.607 --> 21:20.308
Gideon, pull up George
Lucas on the historical record.

21:20.310 --> 21:22.477
<i>George Lucas, born
in Modesto, California</i>

21:22.479 --> 21:25.580
<i>on May 14th, 1944.
Named Modesto Hartman's</i>

21:25.582 --> 21:27.482
<i>“Insurance Salesman of the Year”</i>

21:27.484 --> 21:30.685
<i>in 1977, 1980, and 1983.</i>

21:30.687 --> 21:34.489
- Three years, hmm.
- That doesn't seem right.

21:34.491 --> 21:37.492
No.

21:37.494 --> 21:40.095
Gideon, is there a version of history

21:40.097 --> 21:43.365
where Mr. Lucas did
something else with his life?

21:43.367 --> 21:46.568
Apparently this Mr.
Lucas is an aberration.

21:46.570 --> 21:48.536
He's not the aberration.
The Legion of Doom

21:48.538 --> 21:49.971
scaring him is the aberration.

21:49.973 --> 21:51.706
An aberration that
directly affects our lives.

21:51.708 --> 21:55.510
Okay, calm down. Take it back.

21:55.512 --> 21:57.245
Gideon thinks that the Legion's attack

21:57.247 --> 21:58.780
on Mr. Hunter's film set caused

21:58.782 --> 22:01.149
this George Lucas guy
to quit movie making.

22:01.151 --> 22:03.118
As a result, he never
made some movie about

22:03.120 --> 22:04.452
space battles or another one about

22:04.454 --> 22:06.354
an improbably handsome archaeologist.

22:06.356 --> 22:08.089
And we care about this because...?

22:08.091 --> 22:11.092
<i>In the unaltered timeline,
Dr. Palmer sees “Star Wars”</i>

22:11.094 --> 22:13.828
<i>as a child, and is inspired
to become an inventor.</i>

22:13.830 --> 22:16.464
<i>Likewise, Dr. Heywood

22:16.466 --> 22:19.134
<i>after seeing “Indiana
Jones” instead of becoming</i>

22:19.136 --> 22:21.002
<i>a yoga instructor.</i>

22:21.004 --> 22:23.171
- Oh, man.
- Wait, so you're telling me

22:23.173 --> 22:25.640
that because some film
geek drops out of school,

22:25.642 --> 22:28.943
my inventor and my historian
are now essentially useless?

22:28.945 --> 22:30.445
- Yes.
- Hey!

22:30.447 --> 22:33.014
<i>If the aberration is not corrected, yes.</i>

22:33.016 --> 22:35.350
We need to fix this now.

22:35.352 --> 22:37.719
<i>I fear you may already be too late.</i>

22:37.721 --> 22:40.355

23:08.800 --> 23:10.066
There he is.

23:10.068 --> 23:11.668
George Lucas, the man who inspires

23:11.670 --> 23:13.870
both of our careers, supposedly.

23:13.872 --> 23:17.073
- Well, let's go inspire him.
- Guys, maybe I should do the...

23:17.075 --> 23:19.109
Hey, George. Remember us?

23:19.111 --> 23:20.410
- Hey!
- I had metallic skin.

23:20.412 --> 23:21.711
- No, no.
- Hey...

23:21.713 --> 23:23.647
- No, no, no, no.
- Look, time takes

23:23.649 --> 23:25.315
time to harden, and sooner or later,

23:25.317 --> 23:27.017
we're gonna lose our
superpowers the same way

23:27.019 --> 23:28.652
we're losing our memories.

23:28.654 --> 23:30.654
If you don't make the
movies that you make,

23:30.656 --> 23:32.422
I don't become a brilliant inventor.

23:32.424 --> 23:35.292
And I don't become an
incredibly handsome historian.

23:35.294 --> 23:37.527
I haven't made any movies yet, okay?

23:37.529 --> 23:41.097
I'm still in film school. Or I was.

23:41.099 --> 23:43.934
That's the point. If you
don't go back to school,

23:43.936 --> 23:45.402
you screw up both of our lives.

23:45.404 --> 23:46.937
We don't live up to our full potential.

23:46.939 --> 23:48.505
And I do not want to be a heart surgeon.

23:48.507 --> 23:50.340
And I don't want to
be a yoga instructor.

23:50.342 --> 23:52.976
Okay, guys, like I
said, why don't I talk to

23:52.978 --> 23:54.444
- our time aberration?
- Yeah, but...

23:54.446 --> 23:57.314
- Shh.
- Stay in school.

24:01.301 --> 24:02.986
I'm sorry about my
friends, they're just...

24:02.988 --> 24:06.456
- Completely insane?
- Yeah.

24:06.458 --> 24:08.825
But what they say is true.

24:08.827 --> 24:11.494
Oh, okay, what... What that you guys

24:11.496 --> 24:14.698
are from the future,
that you've somehow seen

24:14.700 --> 24:16.466
a bunch of movies that
I haven't even made yet?

24:16.468 --> 24:18.168
Well, actually, I'm from the past,

24:18.170 --> 24:20.236
but that's beside the point.

24:20.238 --> 24:23.573
Look, George, I don't care about movies,

24:23.575 --> 24:26.276
but guys like them?

24:26.278 --> 24:28.266
They do.

24:28.291 --> 24:31.047
So before you get in that
car and drive back to Modesto,

24:31.049 --> 24:33.416
just think about them, okay?

24:33.418 --> 24:35.185
Them, and all the
millions of other people

24:35.187 --> 24:38.221
that your stories will someday inspire.

24:38.223 --> 24:42.225
The future of the
entire world is at stake.

24:42.227 --> 24:44.527
And you're our only hope.

24:48.333 --> 24:51.234
I've never actually seen
your quarters, Mr. Rory.

24:51.236 --> 24:54.004
They're charming.

24:54.006 --> 24:56.539
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

24:56.541 --> 24:59.509
Something unusual,
some sort of receiver.

24:59.511 --> 25:02.379
Judging by its design, one sensitive

25:02.381 --> 25:04.647
to gravitation-wave transmissions.

25:04.649 --> 25:07.717
You're telling me I
have an antenna in my head.

25:07.719 --> 25:10.053
Well, the good news is you're not crazy.

25:10.055 --> 25:11.429
Oh, really?

25:11.454 --> 25:14.190
So, seeing and talking to Snart's real?

25:14.192 --> 25:17.127
Well, in a sense,
yes. Your former partner

25:17.129 --> 25:19.696
was killed when the Oculus exploded

25:19.698 --> 25:21.231
in a blast of temporal energy.

25:21.233 --> 25:25.368
Now, if Mr. Snart was able
to bond with that blast,

25:25.370 --> 25:28.071
the version of him you're
now seeing could be...

25:28.073 --> 25:30.540
Um, how will I put this?

25:30.542 --> 25:34.077
- Like a time-ghost?
- Precisely.

25:34.079 --> 25:36.112
But what I want to know
is how did someone manage

25:36.114 --> 25:39.115
to put a device inside your brain

25:39.117 --> 25:41.217
without you knowing it?

25:41.219 --> 25:43.887
You are Chronos. [moaning]

25:43.889 --> 25:46.089
The Time Masters.

25:46.091 --> 25:50.493
They did some sick things
to me when I was Chronos.

25:50.495 --> 25:53.196
I'm sorry, I forgot.

25:53.198 --> 25:55.565
So what you're saying
is Snart's stuck out there,

25:55.567 --> 25:58.968
blasted into a billion
pieces, floating around

25:58.970 --> 26:00.703
in time and space?

26:00.705 --> 26:04.541
A rather simplistic way
of looking at it, but yes.

26:04.543 --> 26:07.043
- You're an idiot.
- Excuse me?

26:07.045 --> 26:10.180
It didn't have to end like this.

26:11.716 --> 26:16.052
- Mr. Snart, is he here?
- “Why am I here”?

26:16.054 --> 26:19.489
Why are you here? You're dead.

26:19.491 --> 26:21.558
What's he saying?

26:21.560 --> 26:25.662
He's telling me I've gone soft
because I'm still on the ship.

26:25.664 --> 26:28.164
[groans]

26:28.166 --> 26:30.400
Doc, Doc...

26:30.402 --> 26:32.535
you gotta get this thing out of my head.

26:32.537 --> 26:35.138
As I explained, I'm
not a medical doctor...

26:35.140 --> 26:36.806
[growls]

26:36.808 --> 26:39.409
But I'm sure Gideon and I
can figure something out.

26:39.411 --> 26:43.580
- That could work?
- In theory, yes.

26:48.353 --> 26:50.420

26:50.422 --> 26:51.921
Huh.

26:54.759 --> 26:56.826
Groovy office.

26:56.828 --> 27:00.864
It used to be yours.

27:00.866 --> 27:03.366
Come on, none of this is bringing back

27:03.368 --> 27:05.435
- any memories for you?
- Listen, lady,

27:05.437 --> 27:08.705
I-I wish that I could be
the guy you want me to be.

27:08.707 --> 27:12.575
“Rip,” but I am not.

27:13.979 --> 27:17.947
I take it you two were... pretty tight?

27:17.949 --> 27:21.217
- Yeah, he saved my life.
- Cool.

27:21.219 --> 27:22.685
You.

27:22.687 --> 27:26.456
You saved my life. I was lost.

27:26.458 --> 27:29.459
You came, you recruited
me, you gave me purpose.

27:29.461 --> 27:34.297
Oh, it sounds like Sandra.
She's the hero of my... my movie.

27:34.299 --> 27:35.832
- That's weird that...
- What?

27:35.834 --> 27:40.170
A female hero? Get with the times, lady.

27:40.172 --> 27:43.106
Yo, we're all in this movie.

27:43.108 --> 27:44.707
I mean, it's different versions of us,

27:44.709 --> 27:47.343
but this is definitely the team.

27:47.345 --> 27:51.047
Like on, uh, page 89, my character, Max,

27:51.049 --> 27:52.916
- he saves everybody...
- Hold on.

27:52.918 --> 27:55.485
You're telling me that this
burnout used repressed memories

27:55.487 --> 27:58.154
- to write a screenplay?
- That's not all.

27:58.156 --> 28:00.323
He's writing about the Spear of Destiny.

28:00.325 --> 28:03.826
Which you had with you
when you time-jumped

28:03.828 --> 28:06.362
- off the Waverider.
- I don't know...

28:06.364 --> 28:08.898
- what you are talking about.
- Yes, you do.

28:08.900 --> 28:10.466
- Come on, now.
- What?

28:10.468 --> 28:13.636
I just made it all up.
The spear is the MacGuffin.

28:13.638 --> 28:14.670
Both: The what?

28:14.695 --> 28:16.839
The thing in the movie
that everyone's trying to get.

28:16.841 --> 28:19.075
- Well, where is it?
- In the movie?

28:19.077 --> 28:22.478
It... It's in pieces. Rip
just has a fragment of it.

28:22.480 --> 28:26.316
What inspired you to write it that way?

28:26.318 --> 28:27.917
I don't know.

28:27.919 --> 28:29.485
I just had this old piece of wood.

28:29.487 --> 28:32.288
I thought it'd be a cool movie prop.

28:32.290 --> 28:34.023
- Where is it?
- Uh, I gave it

28:34.025 --> 28:40.129
- to my prop master, George.
- Oh, great.

your mind, George Lucas.

Going back to film school?
Definitely the right call.

Ah, Mr. Lucas, you have something

29:11.696 --> 29:14.264
that we have traveled
a very long way to find.

- And if you do mind,

29:28.904 --> 29:31.704
we'd be happy to kill you.

29:31.706 --> 29:35.575
- I'll cover George Lucas.
- And I've got...

29:35.577 --> 29:37.443
- What?
- It's not here.

29:37.445 --> 29:38.645
My suit's not here.

29:38.670 --> 29:40.747
I can't steel up.

29:40.749 --> 29:42.115
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.

29:42.117 --> 29:43.316
Put 'em up!

29:43.318 --> 29:44.684
- He was talking.
- Up. Hands.

29:44.686 --> 29:47.387
- Shut up.
- They're up.

29:47.389 --> 29:49.589
Thank God. I don't think it's here.

29:49.591 --> 29:51.357
All right, Spec-y four-eyes. I'm starting

29:51.359 --> 29:54.827
to lose my patience with
you. Where is the spear?

29:54.829 --> 29:57.096
What spear?

29:57.098 --> 29:59.832
We had a little chat with
the members of your film crew,

29:59.834 --> 30:02.068
and they all claimed the
Spear of Destiny was a prop,

30:02.070 --> 30:04.270
and that you, Mr.
Lucas, were its master.

30:04.272 --> 30:06.673
But the movie was done.
I tossed all the props

30:06.675 --> 30:08.241
down the garbage chute.
They were just trash.

30:08.243 --> 30:12.178
But, but, but... Shh.

30:12.180 --> 30:14.781
I have one question for
you, Mr. Lucas, and your life

30:14.783 --> 30:18.217
depends on answering me honestly.

30:20.055 --> 30:23.256
Where's the city dump?

30:23.258 --> 30:26.793
Gideon, set us down as close
to the location as you can get.
