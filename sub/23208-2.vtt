01:22.270 --> 01:24.120
I wondered if you
were going to turn up.

01:24.360 --> 01:25.560
Sorry, Tommy.

01:25.770 --> 01:27.210
You know what I'm
like with time.

01:27.240 --> 01:29.190
It's always half
past my left freckle.

01:30.360 --> 01:31.560
What's all this?

01:31.990 --> 01:35.210
I just wanted to get a
few extra bits and pieces.

01:35.330 --> 01:38.480
I thought, if we had some funny
props, that it might inspire us.

01:38.510 --> 01:40.490
You know, like we used to,
back in the day.

01:40.630 --> 01:42.700
Novelty items and whatnot.

01:43.350 --> 01:45.090
This was such a bad idea.

01:49.120 --> 01:52.630
It's just, I had to get rid
of a lot of the old props.

01:52.660 --> 01:55.270
I kept them for years, all boxed
up in my mother's back bedroom,

01:55.300 --> 02:00.290
but then she passed and I had to
chuck them all in an old skip.

02:00.990 --> 02:02.670
Hey, that could be a bit,
couldn't it?

02:02.700 --> 02:04.030
What do people do
with their old skips?

02:04.060 --> 02:05.590
Where do they dump them?

02:06.480 --> 02:09.630
Sorry. Sorry, I'm babbling.

02:11.400 --> 02:13.040
It's good to see you, Tommy.

02:13.960 --> 02:15.420
People call me Thomas now.

02:15.840 --> 02:18.470
I haven't been
Tommy for 30 years.

02:19.070 --> 02:20.650
Well, you look well.

02:21.030 --> 02:24.380
What do we do? Do we hug,
shake hands, rub noses?

02:24.410 --> 02:27.520
Let's just get on with it,
shall we? I haven't got long.

02:29.630 --> 02:32.750
OK. What do you
want to do first?

02:32.780 --> 02:34.370
Shall we try the
interview sketch?

02:34.400 --> 02:37.440
"Ease ourselves in gently," as
the bishop said to the choirboy?

02:37.470 --> 02:39.030
If you wish, yes.

02:40.820 --> 02:44.170
I hope I remember it all.
I think I have it.

02:47.750 --> 02:50.050
I listen to the albums
from time to time.

02:52.470 --> 02:55.590
I still have VHSs of all the
telly stuff, but I can't play 'em.

02:58.860 --> 03:00.710
Did you ever hear anything
back from those lads

03:00.740 --> 03:02.290
who wanted to bring out a DVD?

03:02.320 --> 03:04.930
- No. Are you ready?
- One sec.

03:09.740 --> 03:12.880
- And no looking out at the audience.
- What do you mean?

03:13.140 --> 03:14.260
You know what I mean.
You always used to do it.

03:14.290 --> 03:15.500
Mugging to the front row.

03:15.530 --> 03:17.400
- No, I never.
- You did!

03:17.720 --> 03:19.270
Especially if I
had a funny line.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.810
You'd look out and take it, as
if you'd earned the laugh. Don't.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.700
- Pisses me off.
- I don't think I do that.

03:23.730 --> 03:24.680
Right, well,
next time you do it,

03:24.710 --> 03:27.380
- I'll click my fingers and you'll see,
all right? - OK, fine.

03:27.870 --> 03:29.990
- Good to see you, too.
- Start.

03:37.490 --> 03:38.690
Sorry.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.000
Come in.

03:45.940 --> 03:47.630
Hello. I'm here
for the interview.

03:49.720 --> 03:51.820
Nah, you're all right.
I've got some at home.

03:51.920 --> 03:53.330
No, no, I mean would
you like to sit down?

03:53.360 --> 03:54.980
Oh, yes. Thank you.

03:58.150 --> 03:59.200
So, you found us all right?

03:59.230 --> 04:01.420
Yes. Your map was
extremely comprehensive.

04:01.450 --> 04:03.560
Like your education, I see.

04:05.590 --> 04:07.330
All right, you don't
have to do it every time.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.230
I do. My laugh.

04:10.520 --> 04:13.100
So, allow me to introduce
myself. My name is Mr Kirk.

04:13.130 --> 04:16.410
Och, Mr Kirk.
Is that a wee Scots name, Jimmy?

04:16.440 --> 04:17.190
No, I don't think so.

04:17.220 --> 04:19.620
As a matter of fact,
my father was born in Ireland.

04:20.250 --> 04:23.280
The Emerald Isle. They've
got leprechauns and Guinness,

04:23.310 --> 04:24.720
to be sure, to be sure.

04:24.750 --> 04:26.290
So,
the company is based in Leeds...

04:26.320 --> 04:28.610
Nay, lad!
Ee, bah gum and ecky thump!

04:28.640 --> 04:30.350
- ..Working closely with...
- Harry Ramsden's!

04:30.380 --> 04:31.830
Best chips in
th'all of Yorkshire.

04:31.860 --> 04:33.290
The Sony Corporation...

04:33.320 --> 04:35.880
Ah, so, number one son.

04:35.910 --> 04:36.720
Exporting to India...

04:36.750 --> 04:39.210
Cor blimey, mister!
10,000 apologies.

04:39.240 --> 04:40.940
- ..Via Buckingham.
- Oh, I say!

04:40.970 --> 04:43.830
- How terribly, terribly posh.
- We have an office in Moscow...

04:43.860 --> 04:45.160
Vodka, comrade!

04:45.190 --> 04:46.840
- A branch in London...
- Lovely jubbly.

04:46.870 --> 04:49.180
..And we're expanding
into Madagascar.

04:50.550 --> 04:51.330
Really? How interesting.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.880
Look, would you concentrate,
please?

04:52.910 --> 04:55.510
I'm looking for a serious
candidate to fill this position.

04:55.540 --> 04:58.120
- Well, I did go to university.
- Really? Where did you study?

04:58.150 --> 04:59.990
- Cambridge.
- When can you start?

05:02.880 --> 05:04.840
Boom! It's a belter, that.

05:04.870 --> 05:05.920
Still works, doesn't it?

05:05.950 --> 05:07.650
You won't be able to
do any of that ending.

05:07.990 --> 05:09.190
What do you mean?

05:09.540 --> 05:12.670
- Can't do Chinese and
Asian voices any more. - Why?

05:12.700 --> 05:14.860
Because, Len,
it is what is known as racist.

05:14.890 --> 05:15.850
Oh, give over!

05:15.880 --> 05:17.780
- That's the joke.
- What's the joke?

05:18.040 --> 05:20.350
What are you inviting
people to laugh at, exactly?

05:20.380 --> 05:23.400
Just...A man doing
all daft voices.

05:23.430 --> 05:25.070
We did it in our first series.

05:25.100 --> 05:26.120
We only had one series,
remember?

05:26.150 --> 05:27.570
Yeah, but still,
it's been on telly.

05:27.600 --> 05:28.650
Nobody complained.

05:28.680 --> 05:30.640
Well, things have changed.
That was then.

05:30.980 --> 05:34.300
All right,
what about Goodness Gracious Me?

05:34.330 --> 05:36.040
They were all Asian, Len.

05:36.550 --> 05:41.020
It's like Jackie Mason telling Jew jokes
or Richard Pryor doing black material.

05:41.050 --> 05:43.480
You're only allowed to take
the piss out of your own tribe.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.780
I don't think you should be
calling them a tribe, Tommy.

05:45.810 --> 05:46.870
That IS racialist.

05:46.900 --> 05:49.850
Look, we can't do this sketch,
all right?

05:51.410 --> 05:54.410
- So, can we not do
Ching Chong Chinaman? - No.

05:55.300 --> 05:57.120
In fact, I don't think we
should be doing this at all.

05:57.150 --> 05:58.280
I've made a mistake. I'm going.

05:58.310 --> 06:00.520
Oh, no. Tommy, please don't go.

06:00.550 --> 06:02.830
I haven't seen you in 30 years.

06:04.980 --> 06:06.940
Let's at least give it a chance.

06:08.220 --> 06:12.750
♪If you're going to cry♪

06:12.780 --> 06:15.090
♪Cry tears of laughter♪

06:15.120 --> 06:18.030
♪A smile takes much less
effort than a frown.♪

06:18.720 --> 06:21.080
Hey, Tommy,
I've just finished my jigsaw!

06:21.110 --> 06:22.590
Oh, was it difficult?

06:22.620 --> 06:24.700
Well, it said three to
five years on the box.

06:24.730 --> 06:26.530
Only took me six months.

06:31.580 --> 06:34.450
- You know I live in France now?
- Yeah.

06:34.850 --> 06:37.470
Our Leanne said she'd read a
piece about you in the Standard.

06:37.500 --> 06:40.520
- You do computers, don't you?
- Digital marketing.

06:41.460 --> 06:43.820
Got my own company,
Angry Tomato.

06:43.980 --> 06:45.830
15 offices worldwide.

06:45.860 --> 06:47.680
100 people working under me.

06:47.870 --> 06:49.220
Does it not tickle?

06:50.680 --> 06:52.070
I've moved on, Len.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.140
All this Cheese &
Crackers stuff...

06:55.560 --> 06:58.590
You know I employ someone to
take down those YouTube clips?

06:58.620 --> 07:00.310
- No!
- Course I do.

07:00.700 --> 07:03.400
I can't afford to go into
a meeting with the HSBC

07:03.430 --> 07:05.340
and someone's found
me as Tina Turner

07:05.370 --> 07:06.940
with tights on my head and
ping-pong balls for eyes.

07:06.970 --> 07:09.220
It's good publicity,
that YouTube, you know.

07:09.250 --> 07:11.320
My nephews are showing me.
You can get everything on it.

07:11.350 --> 07:14.800
I know you can, Len,
and it's an embarrassment to me.

07:17.090 --> 07:18.290
I see.

07:19.970 --> 07:21.510
Do you want a cup of tea?

07:23.070 --> 07:24.550
Is there any peppermint?

07:26.650 --> 07:28.570
Oh, forget it.
I'll just have builder's.

07:29.310 --> 07:31.310
Your Leanne's grown up
into a lovely young girl.

07:31.340 --> 07:33.920
Oh, hasn't she?
A right bobby-dazzler.

07:34.810 --> 07:37.740
When she wrote to me and asked
me about doing this gig, I was...

07:38.340 --> 07:41.650
Well, you won't be surprised to learn
I was unenthusiastic, to say the least.

07:41.680 --> 07:45.080
I know, Tommy. Sorry. Thomas.

07:46.190 --> 07:48.110
You remember that Morecambe and
Wise interview when they were asked,

07:48.140 --> 07:49.900
"What would you have been if
you hadn't been comedians?"

07:49.930 --> 07:51.690
And Eric said,
"Mike and Bernie Winters"?

07:51.720 --> 07:54.080
Yeah. Funny line.

07:54.340 --> 07:56.560
Well, we weren't even
Mike and Bernie Winters.

07:57.980 --> 07:58.600
We weren't that good.

07:58.630 --> 08:01.200
- No, I'm not having that, Tommy.
- It's true.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.770
We came up in the mid-'80s,
arse end of variety.

08:03.800 --> 08:06.140
Got lucky with one series
on Anglia Television.

08:06.170 --> 08:08.970
It was more than that.
What about all the live stuff?

08:09.130 --> 08:11.510
Ten nights at Leeds
City Varieties.

08:11.630 --> 08:14.000
Top of the bill with Mick Miller,
Bobby Knutt and The Grumbleweeds,

08:14.030 --> 08:15.220
you can't get better than that.

08:15.250 --> 08:17.210
It's hardly the Rat Pack,
is it, Len?

08:19.140 --> 08:20.570
So, why have you come, then?

08:22.830 --> 08:24.030
How could I not?

08:25.700 --> 08:27.490
Plus, you still owe me 25 quid.

08:27.520 --> 08:28.720
What for?

08:30.470 --> 08:32.320
Bernie Clifton's dressing room.

09:35.210 --> 09:37.280
Well, there you go. You've
just proved you don't need me.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.930
- You're funny on your own.
- Of course I need you!

09:39.960 --> 09:42.490
You can't have Crackers
without the Cheese.

09:42.520 --> 09:43.200
That's another thing.

09:43.230 --> 09:45.390
I hate that stupid name.
I always did.

09:45.420 --> 09:48.600
But someone had already registered
Cheese & Onion. I told you!

09:48.630 --> 09:52.160
Why did it have to be Cheese
and anything? It's so babyish.

09:52.420 --> 09:54.430
- And it's not funny.
- Well, I think it's funny.

09:54.460 --> 09:56.950
It's too generic. First rule
of comedy - be specific.

09:56.980 --> 09:58.510
You never say biscuit.
You say Garibaldi.

09:58.540 --> 10:00.090
All right, Ted Bovis!

10:00.120 --> 10:04.720
If we do this - if -
I want us to use our real names.

10:04.890 --> 10:07.490
- But then no-one'll know who we are.
- Correct.

10:08.370 --> 10:09.310
All right, fine.

10:09.340 --> 10:10.580
I'll tell our Leanne to have us

10:10.610 --> 10:12.630
billed as Shelby & Drake
if that's what you want.

10:12.660 --> 10:14.770
Why Shelby & Drake?
Why not Drake & Shelby?

10:15.370 --> 10:18.350
I don't know. It just sounds
better. It's the music of it.

10:18.380 --> 10:20.680
- Drake & Shelby goes down.
- What?

10:20.710 --> 10:23.070
Shelby & Drake! Da-da-da-da!

10:23.100 --> 10:25.190
Drake & Shelby. Da-da-da-da.

10:25.220 --> 10:26.160
You see? It goes down.

10:26.190 --> 10:27.240
Only if you do it like that.
You could do...

10:27.270 --> 10:29.260
Drake & Shelby! Da-da-da-da!

10:29.290 --> 10:30.370
All right, fine.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.850
It's not a bother.
Either way works.

10:32.880 --> 10:34.930
I'm just glad we're
doing it again.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.420
Though I will have to tell that
researcher on Britain's Got Talent

10:37.450 --> 10:39.020
- cos if we change the name...
- What?

10:39.050 --> 10:41.730
Oh, it's nothing. I just
put in an application form.

10:41.760 --> 10:43.590
- For Britain's Got Talent?
- Yeah.

10:43.620 --> 10:45.530
It's all back now - you know,
variety.

10:45.560 --> 10:47.040
- Massive viewing figures.
- I can't believe...

10:47.070 --> 10:49.240
On what planet did you think
I would humiliate myself

10:49.270 --> 10:51.900
by appearing on that
programme...with you?

10:51.930 --> 10:54.390
Well, I don't remember you being so
fussy when Blankety Blank came knocking.

10:54.420 --> 10:56.840
- I told you, they wouldn't
have us both on. - Oh, really?

10:56.870 --> 10:58.880
Yes, I tried, but they went
with Lorraine Chase instead.

10:58.910 --> 11:00.710
I'd have killed in that
bottom middle seat.

11:00.740 --> 11:03.720
That was the place to be.
All the great clowns sat there -

11:03.750 --> 11:06.580
- Everett, Starr, Doddy.
- That is not the point.

11:06.610 --> 11:09.570
I agreed to come back and do one
last gig to an invited audience,

11:09.600 --> 11:12.330
and I only said yes because your
daughter wrote and told me that...

11:15.040 --> 11:16.240
What?

11:17.220 --> 11:19.420
That things haven't been great
for you the last few years.

11:20.860 --> 11:22.610
What do you mean?
What did she tell you?

11:24.450 --> 11:27.480
- Never mind. - No, go on.
I want to know what she said.

11:31.020 --> 11:33.490
Cheese & Crackers are not
doing Britain's Got Talent.

11:35.430 --> 11:36.630
Ok.

11:37.900 --> 11:39.870
But Drake & Shelby might, yeah?

11:39.930 --> 11:41.700
Let's rehearse the vent sketch.

12:06.320 --> 12:07.850
You haven't gone, have you?

12:08.080 --> 12:11.190
No. I'm still here.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.480
I won't be able to lift you out.
I've got this hiatus hernia.

12:23.510 --> 12:26.130
Oh, sure.
My knees are gone anyway.

12:27.920 --> 12:29.230
We'll figure it out.

12:32.670 --> 12:33.870
Right.

12:36.340 --> 12:38.600
So, boys and girls,
this is Vincent.

12:38.630 --> 12:40.650
- Say hello, Vincent.
- Hello, Vincent.

12:40.680 --> 12:42.330
What are your first impressions?

12:42.360 --> 12:45.390
Sorry, I don't do impressions.

12:45.420 --> 12:48.060
No, no, I mean what do you
hope to get out of this school?

12:48.090 --> 12:51.310
All the TVs and video recorders!

12:51.340 --> 12:54.580
Yeah, I thought, there, Tommy, we could
update it and say computers instead.

12:54.610 --> 12:55.010
Yeah, whatever.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.680
OK, Vincent, so,
we'll give you a quick test.

12:57.710 --> 12:58.490
How's your grammar?

12:58.520 --> 13:01.040
She's very well, thank you.
How's yours?

13:01.410 --> 13:03.360
No, no,
I mean your English grammar.

13:03.390 --> 13:04.560
Where would you put a colon?

13:04.590 --> 13:06.390
Up your bum!

13:08.010 --> 13:09.700
- What?
- Nothing. Carry on.

13:09.730 --> 13:10.870
So, let's move onto maths.

13:10.900 --> 13:12.950
If a farmer has 12
cows and 18 chickens,

13:14.990 --> 13:16.880
Foot-and-mouth disease.

13:17.560 --> 13:20.680
- History. Where was the Magna
Carta signed? - At the bottom!

13:20.710 --> 13:22.050
Geography. Where are the Andes?

13:22.080 --> 13:23.900
At the end of your armies!

13:23.930 --> 13:26.140
Jesus Christ!
We can't do this, Len.

13:26.170 --> 13:29.020
- No, no, carry on.
- I can't. I can't bear it.

13:29.050 --> 13:30.100
What's wrong?

13:30.130 --> 13:32.080
Do you think punk rockers
might be dated now?

13:32.110 --> 13:34.790
Of course they are!
They were dated in 1984!

13:35.000 --> 13:37.750
This played to silence on
Crackerjack, if you remember.

13:37.780 --> 13:39.290
Janette Krankie wouldn't
look us in the eye.

13:39.320 --> 13:41.040
That's cos she's only 4ft.

13:41.070 --> 13:45.090
No, it's because it's poor.
We need better material.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.730
We needed it then.
We certainly need it now.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.830
Just do the last bit -
the drink bit.

13:57.510 --> 13:58.300
You see?

13:58.330 --> 14:00.300
It's a cracking ending, Tommy.

14:00.330 --> 14:02.460
Though we'll have to make sure
the front row are close enough.

14:02.490 --> 14:04.120
I want to get them all
with that spit take.

14:04.150 --> 14:06.830
- Ooh, yeah, that's a cheap laugh, Len.
- Oh, come on.

14:06.860 --> 14:08.330
A laugh's a laugh
however you word it.

14:08.360 --> 14:09.920
Yeah, for you, maybe.

14:11.650 --> 14:13.140
You know what your problem is?

14:14.790 --> 14:16.340
You've lost your sparkle.

14:17.410 --> 14:21.390
Yeah. You've got no
joy in you any more.

14:21.820 --> 14:25.110
You're like a shark.
You've got dead, black eyes.

14:25.350 --> 14:26.890
All this corporate
stuff you've been doing,

14:26.920 --> 14:29.280
this Angry Pineapple,
it's sucked the life out of you.

14:29.310 --> 14:31.050
- Tomato.
- What?

14:31.080 --> 14:32.620
It's Angry Tomato.

14:32.830 --> 14:35.720
And I'm sorry I'm no fun any more,
but I'm a different person now.

14:36.480 --> 14:40.100
You were no fun then.
You've always been miserable.

14:40.450 --> 14:44.120
That's why it all dried up
for us. People could sense it.

14:44.970 --> 14:47.040
You killed Cheese & Crackers,
Tommy.

14:47.070 --> 14:48.990
I'm sorry,
but it has to be said.

14:52.280 --> 14:54.030
You weren't always like this.

14:55.400 --> 14:58.200
Remember when we first
started out, back in the day?

14:59.570 --> 15:02.090
We used to cry with laughter
at every little thing.

15:02.120 --> 15:04.940
Yeah, well,
the joke worn thin, didn't it?

15:07.430 --> 15:09.730
- I'm going for a ciggie. Do you...?
- No.

15:10.780 --> 15:13.060
I stopped 20 years ago.
So should you.

16:01.600 --> 16:04.200
- Looks like it's going to rain.
- What's going on, Len?

16:04.230 --> 16:08.330
- What's all this?
- Nothing. They're just...props.

16:08.360 --> 16:09.810
I thought we could have a play,
like I said.

16:09.840 --> 16:11.470
What were you
thinking for these?

16:13.030 --> 16:14.300
Sweeney Todd gets diarrhoea?

16:14.330 --> 16:16.130
No, but it's a good thought.

16:16.160 --> 16:19.760
- Call it Sweeney Turd, boom, we're off.
- Len. Len.

16:21.840 --> 16:23.040
Are you...?

16:24.160 --> 16:26.440
I can't believe I'm saying this.
You're homeless, aren't you?

16:27.450 --> 16:29.900
Well,
our Leanne's got the baby now,

16:29.930 --> 16:32.860
and I have to be down
here for voice-over work.

16:32.890 --> 16:34.180
When did you last do voice-over?

16:34.210 --> 16:35.870
It was a while back,
I grant you.

16:35.900 --> 16:37.170
I think it was for Tudor Crisps.

16:37.200 --> 16:38.540
Why didn't you tell me?

16:40.340 --> 16:41.730
I didn't want you to be jealous.

16:41.760 --> 16:43.670
Not about the crisps.

16:43.840 --> 16:46.620
About being homeless.
How has that happened?

16:47.020 --> 16:49.360
Don't know.
It just sort of crept up on me.

16:50.260 --> 16:52.080
Missed a few payments.

16:52.110 --> 16:55.680
Next thing I know, there's a sign on
the door, all the locks have changed.

16:56.290 --> 16:58.450
I had 15 minutes to
grab what I could.

16:58.660 --> 17:01.750
- So, where are you actually
staying now? - Here and there.

17:01.780 --> 17:03.410
Few nights at Leanne's.

17:04.220 --> 17:07.589
One or two other
spots I've found.

17:08.930 --> 17:11.000
I wish you'd told me sooner.
I could have helped you.

17:11.030 --> 17:14.089
I don't want your money, Tommy.
I never did.

17:15.950 --> 17:17.770
I just want you by my side.

17:18.650 --> 17:20.980
One last serving of
Cheese & Crackers.

17:25.650 --> 17:26.849
All right.

17:27.470 --> 17:28.560
What do you want to do next?

17:28.590 --> 17:31.280
Well, I thought we could have
a go at One Man Went To Mow.

17:31.310 --> 17:33.020
You know, with all the
quickfire impressions.

17:33.050 --> 17:36.220
- But we can't do it now.
- Well, we could if we practised.

17:36.250 --> 17:38.760
No, we can't do it cos
they're all Yewtree.

17:39.770 --> 17:40.970
They're not, are they?

17:42.290 --> 17:43.910
Oh, God, you're right!

17:44.230 --> 17:47.070
- He's not Yewtree, is he?
- Not yet, but he will be.

17:47.310 --> 17:49.520
We could still do
all the cartoon ones.

17:49.550 --> 17:51.930
Ooh! Ooh! Mr Peevly! Mr Peevly!

17:51.960 --> 17:55.240
- Do you think people still remember
the Hair Bear Bunch? - Yes!

17:55.280 --> 17:57.680
People love remembering things
that happened in the '70s.

17:57.710 --> 17:58.910
This lot don't.

17:58.960 --> 18:01.660
- When I last did panto...
- In 1992. Carry on.

18:01.690 --> 18:04.400
When I last did panto,
I did them all

18:04.430 --> 18:08.510
Hong Kong Phooey, Dick
Dastardly, Mary, Mungo And Midge.

18:08.540 --> 18:10.030
What did you do for Mary,
Mungo And Midge?

18:10.060 --> 18:12.160
I just watched the lift go down.

18:16.170 --> 18:17.860
Well, that must have
been a fun evening.

18:17.890 --> 18:20.600
Well, it wasn't easy
being one ugly sister.

18:22.100 --> 18:25.300
All right, but shouldn't we be thinking
of something more contemporary?

18:25.330 --> 18:27.760
- Who makes you laugh?
- Eh?

18:28.130 --> 18:30.680
What current stuff do you
watch that makes you laugh?

18:30.830 --> 18:34.070
I've always admired that
young lad Joe Pasquale.

18:34.110 --> 18:35.720
He's 56!

18:35.910 --> 18:37.690
He's about as current
as Kajagoogoo.

18:37.720 --> 18:40.950
Funny bones, though.
And he's a brilliant prop comic.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.480
But if you still want
to make it in this game,

18:42.510 --> 18:45.480
you've got to follow
what the rules are now.

18:45.510 --> 18:49.850
With my business head on, I'd be looking
at current trends, gaps in the market.

18:49.880 --> 18:52.820
- At the moment, we're an outdated
model. - It's heritage comedy.

18:52.850 --> 18:54.950
It's magic, what we do.

18:55.240 --> 18:58.310
- It's not a business.
- It is a business, Len.

18:58.410 --> 19:00.030
Show business.

19:00.060 --> 19:02.800
And that's what you failed
to grasp, and that's why...

19:03.480 --> 19:04.680
What?

19:05.680 --> 19:08.250
- Nothing.
- No, tell me.

19:08.940 --> 19:11.360
It's obviously been on
your mind for 30 years.

19:11.590 --> 19:14.770
All right.
Bernie Clifton's dressing room.

19:14.800 --> 19:17.120
What about Bernie
Clifton's dressing room?

19:17.870 --> 19:19.710
- You don't remember?
- No.

19:20.440 --> 19:22.310
And that is my point.

19:24.310 --> 19:25.940
Let's do Brown Bottles.

He's so mean, you'd need a spanner
to get 50p out of his hand.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.860
- Give us a kiss!
-*There'll be no more bottles...*

22:15.770 --> 22:17.400
And no more wall.

22:20.150 --> 22:23.040
Takes it out of you, that one.
It's funny, though.

22:23.070 --> 22:25.930
So, you don't remember Bernie
Clifton's dressing room?

22:26.060 --> 22:28.640
No, I don't. Why do you have
to keep bringing that up?

22:28.670 --> 22:31.970
We were on stage, Glasgow
Pavilion, doing Brown Bottles.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.210
You walked off to get the broom.
You never came back.

22:34.350 --> 22:37.250
You left me standing there,
humiliated, vamping for ten minutes

22:37.280 --> 22:39.430
while the audience
started slow handclapping,

22:39.460 --> 22:41.440
people shouting,
"Where's the funny one?"

22:41.470 --> 22:43.100
I walked off to find you

22:43.130 --> 22:47.180
in Bernie Clifton's dressing room lying
on the floor, choking in your own vomit.

22:47.210 --> 22:49.940
Probably cos I'd just necked seven
bottles of beer in three minutes.

22:49.970 --> 22:51.670
Yeah, and how many times
a week did you do that?

22:51.700 --> 22:52.660
I can't remember.

22:52.690 --> 22:54.020
Of course you can't remember.

22:54.050 --> 22:58.430
I'm surprised you remember anything
from '83 to '87, the amount you drank.

22:58.640 --> 23:01.410
- What are you saying?
- You nearly died, Len!

23:05.050 --> 23:06.560
You're an alcoholic.

23:07.850 --> 23:10.520
And Bernie Clifton's dressing
room was the last straw.

23:11.440 --> 23:12.820
He had to destroy that ostrich,
you know.

23:12.850 --> 23:13.670
No, he didn't.

23:13.700 --> 23:14.900
He did.

23:15.930 --> 23:18.130
25 quid, I had to give him,
which I never saw back.

23:18.160 --> 23:21.240
Well, it's very stressful, going out on
stage every night, making people laugh.

23:21.270 --> 23:22.540
You don't need to tell me that.

23:22.570 --> 23:25.000
How would you know, Thomas?

23:26.080 --> 23:28.990
I was the one on the
front foot driving it.

23:29.020 --> 23:31.460
You just stood there like
a fucking pillar box.

23:31.490 --> 23:32.970
Oh, and that's why you were
drunk for ten years, is it?

23:33.000 --> 23:36.400
- Oh, don't exaggerate.
- You said I killed Cheese & Crackers...

23:37.540 --> 23:39.330
Because I was miserable?

23:41.320 --> 23:43.430
Why do you think they wouldn't
have you on Blankety Blank,

23:44.160 --> 23:46.230
why we died a death
on Crackerjack?

23:47.440 --> 23:48.670
It was you.

23:50.240 --> 23:52.060
You were always pissed.

23:54.530 --> 23:56.190
I loved performing.

23:57.320 --> 23:59.650
I loved being on
stage every night.

24:00.830 --> 24:03.670
- Nothing gave me more joy.
- So, why did you leave it all, then?

24:03.700 --> 24:05.200
To save you.

24:07.500 --> 24:10.550
You turned into a monster
after six half-hours on Anglia.

24:12.490 --> 24:14.420
I was frightened,
if we got any bigger...

24:17.260 --> 24:18.720
You were killing yourself,

24:19.990 --> 24:21.360
so I walked away.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.400
But you came back, didn't you?

24:24.430 --> 24:26.640
Yes!
And I wish I'd never bothered!

24:28.340 --> 24:29.950
Sorry, am I interrupting?

24:32.110 --> 24:36.030
No. Just...going
through my speech.

24:39.500 --> 24:42.710
- Hard to find the right words.
- I'm sure you'll be fine.

24:44.500 --> 24:47.490
- Aw, have you been looking
through my dad's stuff? - Yeah.

24:48.150 --> 24:50.330
Yeah,
brought back a lot of memories.

24:51.500 --> 24:54.900
- He was a funny man.
- He was.

24:55.860 --> 24:59.100
- Are there many people here?
- Quite a few, yeah.

24:59.770 --> 25:02.300
Syd Little, a couple of Nolans.

25:02.990 --> 25:04.330
- Brought you the order of service.
- Ooh, thanks.

25:06.180 --> 25:07.850
You'll be on after
Janette Krankie,

25:07.880 --> 25:10.710
so if you just give her a
moment to move her box...

25:10.740 --> 25:11.760
Oh, yeah.

25:11.790 --> 25:14.090
My dad wanted it to
be a celebration.

25:14.950 --> 25:17.470
One last gig to an
invited audience.

25:17.500 --> 25:19.120
As long as they don't
expect me to be funny.

25:19.150 --> 25:21.710
Oh, no, I don't think
anyone's expecting that.

25:22.060 --> 25:23.730
Thanks for doing it, though.

25:23.810 --> 25:26.830
I know you and my dad
had unresolved business.

25:26.870 --> 25:29.200
We did, but, erm...

25:30.040 --> 25:31.240
It's too late now.

25:32.160 --> 25:36.340
Like I said earlier, just imagine
he's here with you in the room.

25:38.310 --> 25:39.510
Yeah.

25:40.420 --> 25:43.500
You will come to the do after,
won't you, for a drink and a snack?

25:44.010 --> 25:47.180
We're, erm,
having cheese and crackers.

25:47.210 --> 25:49.050
Well, quite right, too.

25:55.970 --> 25:59.640
we're going to be playing Tears Of
Laughter when they bring him in,

25:59.670 --> 26:01.280
just so you're prepared.

26:02.360 --> 26:03.560
OK.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.110
I almost forgot.

26:08.540 --> 26:10.490
He wanted you to have this.

26:11.590 --> 26:13.650
He was very insistent.

26:15.210 --> 26:17.170
He said you'd know
what it was about.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.070
Thank you, old pal.
