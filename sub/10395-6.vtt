00:29.963 --> 00:31.731
I am so confused.

00:31.732 --> 00:34.434
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.903
Of all of the places, of all the

00:36.904 --> 00:39.072
countries, all the years of

00:39.073 --> 00:42.675
traveling, it's here in Iran

00:42.676 --> 00:47.347
that I am greeted
warmly by strangers.

00:47.348 --> 00:48.648
The other stuff is there, the

00:48.649 --> 00:52.152
Iran we read about, heard
about, seen in the news.

00:52.153 --> 01:00.153

02:26.947 --> 02:29.516
Like a lot of time.

02:29.517 --> 02:30.351
Like four years
I've been trying.

02:30.352 --> 02:34.421
Finally.

02:34.422 --> 02:35.356
Tehran.

02:35.357 --> 02:38.858
City of nearly 8 million people.

02:38.859 --> 02:42.762
Capital of Iran.

02:42.763 --> 02:45.698
Like their neighborhoods
of Rome this feels like.

02:45.699 --> 02:47.734
After all of this time I

02:47.735 --> 02:49.369
finally have my chance to see a

02:49.370 --> 02:51.137
country I heard so much about.

02:51.138 --> 02:52.039
Weather is nice.

02:52.040 --> 02:54.140
I don't know what
I was expecting.

02:54.141 --> 02:55.108
It is nice.

02:55.109 --> 02:59.145
A big blank spot on nearly
every traveler's resume.

02:59.146 --> 02:59.480
Delicious.

02:59.481 --> 03:07.481
Thank you.

03:14.094 --> 03:16.729
Once upon a time there was an

03:16.730 --> 03:21.000
ancient kingdom where they found

03:21.001 --> 03:26.072
a lot of magical black
stuff under the ground.

♪

03:26.274 --> 03:26.440

03:26.441 --> 03:30.477

the key to the magical black

03:30.478 --> 03:30.678
stuff.

03:30.678 --> 03:31.512
And when they wouldn't share.

03:31.513 --> 03:35.114
The people of the ancient
kingdom got mad.

03:35.115 --> 03:38.318
They voted and their leader said

03:38.319 --> 03:43.189
the magical black stuff
is ours to keep.

03:43.190 --> 03:46.659
But the other kingdoms wear
frayed of losing all of the

03:46.660 --> 03:48.628
magical black stuff so they gave

03:48.629 --> 03:55.335
money to some bad men to
get rid of the leader.

03:55.336 --> 03:57.704
They put back in power
another leader.

03:57.705 --> 04:01.107
And they gave him money too.

04:01.108 --> 04:03.810
To some he was a good king.

04:03.811 --> 04:11.050

could be very cruel.

04:11.285 --> 04:11.452

04:11.453 --> 04:14.220
After many years the people

04:14.221 --> 04:17.156

04:17.156 --> 04:21.494
So they scared the
king away forever.

04:21.495 --> 04:28.635
And then things started
to get really messed up.

04:28.636 --> 04:30.337
Okay.

04:30.338 --> 04:32.071
That's a simplistic, incomplete

04:32.072 --> 04:36.175
way to sum up 100-odd
years of Iranian history.

04:36.176 --> 04:38.177
The point is there were a lot of

04:38.178 --> 04:40.146
issues and differing agendas

04:40.147 --> 04:41.548
leading to the explosion of rage

04:41.549 --> 04:45.084
known as the Iranian
hostage crisis.

04:45.085 --> 04:49.589
Look, we know what Iran
the government does.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.591
George W. Bush famously called

04:51.592 --> 04:54.093
them part of the axis of evil.

04:54.094 --> 04:56.162
Their proxies in Iraq have done

04:56.163 --> 04:57.263
American soldiers real harm.

04:57.264 --> 04:58.531
There is no doubt of this.

04:58.532 --> 05:01.000
But I hope I can be forgiven for

05:01.001 --> 05:03.403
finding these undeniable truths

05:03.404 --> 05:07.039
hard to reconcile with how we

05:07.040 --> 05:14.180
are treated on the streets
everywhere we go..

05:14.181 --> 05:16.583
So forget about the politics
if you can for a moment.

05:16.584 --> 05:17.917
How about the food?

05:17.918 --> 05:23.022
The food here is amazing.

05:23.023 --> 05:23.290
♪

05:23.291 --> 05:27.226

05:27.227 --> 05:29.128

05:29.129 --> 05:32.064
the national dish and
the king of kabobs.

05:32.065 --> 05:35.602
Ground lamb with spices,
a good place to start.

05:35.603 --> 05:37.804
So what do you guys
do for a living?

05:37.805 --> 05:39.972
I export nuts.

05:39.973 --> 05:44.210
I am a curator of
contemporary art.

05:44.211 --> 05:46.078
An exploding scene here?

05:46.079 --> 05:48.615
A different culture.

05:48.616 --> 05:50.216
Iranian and Islamic culture.

05:50.217 --> 05:54.220
It has changed a lot
during the last decade.

05:54.221 --> 05:56.823
So this is the actual marrying.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.725
I would recommend you
to try this one.

05:58.726 --> 05:59.059
And this one.

05:59.060 --> 06:01.260
And this one.

06:01.261 --> 06:01.495
Okay.

06:01.496 --> 06:09.496
Why not?

06:11.171 --> 06:17.276
Kabob wouldn't be complete
without Persian rice.

06:17.277 --> 06:21.648
Fluffy, long grained, perfectly

06:21.649 --> 06:24.951
seasoned with saffron, the rice

06:24.952 --> 06:30.289
in this country us unlike
anything you have ever had.

06:30.290 --> 06:31.924
Tony, first you should take

06:31.925 --> 06:39.925
the butter and put
it on your rice.

06:40.468 --> 06:41.701
Bon apetit.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.002
Bon apetit.

06:43.003 --> 06:50.309
It's good.

06:50.310 --> 06:58.310
It was a hopeful time
when I arrived in Iran.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.453
A window had opened.

07:00.454 --> 07:05.291
There had been a slight
loosening of restrictions.

07:05.292 --> 07:06.993
There was optimism for a deal

07:06.994 --> 07:09.061
that could lead to an easing of

07:09.062 --> 07:12.799
crippling economic sanctions
imposed because of Iran's

07:12.800 --> 07:14.066
continued nuclear program.

07:14.067 --> 07:18.838
Trade restrictions very,
very difficult for everyone.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.473
But there is a push happening

07:20.474 --> 07:23.375
between opposing factions
in the government.

07:23.376 --> 07:28.347
On one hand, Iranians have been

07:28.348 --> 07:29.516
descendants of ancient per shah.

07:29.517 --> 07:30.850
Empire of poetry.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.885

07:32.886 --> 07:36.989
culture that goes back
thousand of years.

07:36.990 --> 07:40.660
But the ruling clerical and
military class are at best

07:40.661 --> 07:45.064
ambivalent and at worst
actively hostile to much of the

07:45.065 --> 07:45.866
tradition.

07:45.867 --> 07:50.236
So, the religious based
restrictions of speech, dress,

07:50.237 --> 07:53.039
behavior were ushered in by the

07:53.040 --> 07:57.343
lies of the ayatollah during the

1979 Islamic revolution.

12:35.022 --> 12:39.625

conservative attitudes demand

12:39.994 --> 12:41.160
On the other hand.

12:41.161 --> 12:44.496
Iranian women are famously
assertive, opinionated.

12:51.238 --> 12:52.072
Great question.

12:52.073 --> 12:54.540
Really good question.

12:54.541 --> 13:02.148
I'm happy that you
asked that question.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.749
Do you like it?

13:03.750 --> 13:04.851
Are you happy here?

13:04.852 --> 13:06.853
Look, I am at a point now

13:06.854 --> 13:09.822

13:09.823 --> 13:11.357
certain thing as but home.

13:39.286 --> 13:39.486
Yeah.

resolved, maybe, I hope.

33:11.057 --> 33:13.358
So far, Iran does not look

33:13.359 --> 33:17.028
and does not feel the
way I had expected.

33:17.029 --> 33:17.196
♪

33:17.197 --> 33:18.596
♪

33:18.597 --> 33:22.133
Neither east nor west, but

33:22.134 --> 33:30.134
always some where in the middle.

33:30.909 --> 33:33.711
♪

33:33.712 --> 33:33.879
♪

33:33.880 --> 33:36.647
Well it looks spectacular.

33:36.648 --> 33:38.883
You can't have this
in the restaurant.

33:38.884 --> 33:40.751
It is time consuming.

33:40.752 --> 33:43.388
It is very expensive.

33:43.389 --> 33:45.423
Persian cuisine has to be

33:45.424 --> 33:46.891
experienced in somebody's home.

33:46.892 --> 33:47.759
Thank you.

33:47.760 --> 33:53.731
So this one here is...
Slow cooked yam in yogurt.

33:53.732 --> 33:59.003
Yogurt, saffron and egg yokes.

33:59.004 --> 34:01.606
A prominent art gallery owner

34:01.607 --> 34:03.441
insist I'd come over for lunch

34:03.442 --> 34:05.310
with her friend and family.

34:05.311 --> 34:08.746
Here we have sour cherry rice.

34:08.746 --> 34:09.415
Maple.

34:09.415 --> 34:09.815
Chicken.

34:09.815 --> 34:11.014
Sour cherries.

34:11.016 --> 34:13.251
More than any other,
sour cherries.

34:13.252 --> 34:15.953
The cook has been with the
family for generations.

34:15.954 --> 34:20.425
Rice mixed with yogurt and
saffron baked into a crispy

34:20.426 --> 34:20.626
dough.

34:20.627 --> 34:22.927
Don't think of rice as a
side dish around here.

34:22.928 --> 34:24.929
It can be the main event.

34:24.929 --> 34:26.030
Okay.

34:26.031 --> 34:27.498
Very, very good.

34:27.498 --> 34:35.498
You fut far more on the
table than any one can

34:35.873 --> 34:36.675
conceivably eat.

34:36.676 --> 34:38.042
Yes if you don't like your

34:38.043 --> 34:39.344
guest you don't put anything.

34:39.344 --> 34:43.781
Her we have a large meatball.

34:43.782 --> 34:47.452
Ground beef, onion,
and cooked rice.

34:47.453 --> 34:52.290
Walnuts, dried apricots,
boiled egg and barberries.

34:52.291 --> 34:55.326
An way, we are a very
interesting nation.

34:55.327 --> 34:56.793
Very confusing.

34:56.795 --> 34:58.529
Extremely confusing.

34:58.530 --> 35:04.034
The contradictions are just.

35:04.035 --> 35:06.137
Ined or enormous.

35:06.138 --> 35:08.339
Enormous.

35:08.340 --> 35:10.408
Iranians we take into our
house, and our hearts.

35:10.409 --> 35:16.181
In that way we are extremists
Siena in so many ways.

35:16.182 --> 35:19.817
You see this tortured
relationship between America and

35:19.818 --> 35:20.818
Iran for many years.

35:20.819 --> 35:22.387
How do you think most Americans

35:22.388 --> 35:25.156
will react when they see this?

35:25.157 --> 35:26.857
They will start coming.

35:26.858 --> 35:32.197
It is very important as

35:32.198 --> 35:33.431
Iranians, that we are seen as

35:33.432 --> 35:35.166
humans here, not the so-called

35:35.167 --> 35:37.668
enemy or the darkness of Iran.

35:37.669 --> 35:39.737
Like you go to any body's house

35:39.738 --> 35:43.541
in Iran I am sure they
will welcome you.

35:43.542 --> 35:45.042
The axis of evil.

35:45.043 --> 35:49.013
We are not the axis of evil.

35:49.014 --> 35:50.781
Just normal evil
look everybody else.

35:50.782 --> 35:53.050
Ten years ago Iran was,

35:53.051 --> 35:58.022
people they had hope for
future, young people.

35:58.023 --> 35:59.524
They wanted to travel.

35:59.525 --> 36:01.359
Had a little bit of money.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.560
Because of sanction.

36:02.561 --> 36:04.629
This sanction really
squeeze everybody.

36:04.630 --> 36:06.897
Eight years, no foreign
investment here.

36:06.898 --> 36:09.400
And soap it was very
difficult time.

36:09.401 --> 36:13.037
And, in the population
is really young.

36:13.038 --> 36:14.038
70% are under 35.

36:14.039 --> 36:21.546
And they want to have good job,

36:21.547 --> 36:22.713
they want to have families, but

36:22.714 --> 36:26.384
is not possible now for them.

36:26.385 --> 36:31.222
I hope we can have more faith

36:31.223 --> 36:32.723
in the ordinary Americans,

36:32.724 --> 36:35.226
because every little change in

36:35.227 --> 36:39.597
the policy of the western
country, it really, really

36:39.598 --> 36:47.598
affects our lives here.

36:58.517 --> 37:04.422
The Miraud tower.

37:04.423 --> 37:10.761
It rises 5,000 feet in the air

37:10.762 --> 37:13.664
and looks out over
Tehran and beyond.

37:13.665 --> 37:14.765
We were out on the observation

37:14.766 --> 37:16.267
deck taking it all in, trying to

37:16.268 --> 37:18.769
make some sense of it all.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.871
Our time in Iran was coming to

37:20.872 --> 37:23.308
an end and it was impossible to

37:23.309 --> 37:25.142
say, was a window opening?

37:25.143 --> 37:33.143
Or was it only a moment in
time before it shut again?

37:36.522 --> 37:38.623
You learn pretty quickly that in

37:38.624 --> 37:42.527
Iran, there is
plenty of gray area.

37:42.528 --> 37:47.031
An undefined territory.

37:47.032 --> 37:48.633
Where is the line?

37:48.634 --> 37:55.873
It seems to change with
barely a moment's notice.

37:55.874 --> 38:01.346
Here it comes.

38:01.347 --> 38:06.851
This isn't the first time
that we have experienced such

38:06.852 --> 38:14.852
thing.

38:20.265 --> 38:23.635
Please follow me.

39:07.779 --> 39:09.747
Last day in Iran.

39:09.748 --> 39:12.116
Night falls, and kids, like kids

39:12.117 --> 39:14.118
anywhere, get in their rides and

39:14.119 --> 39:19.790
head for anywhere
they can hang out.

39:19.791 --> 39:22.226
American classics here.

39:22.227 --> 39:24.629
Where do you get them?

39:24.630 --> 39:25.497
Old men.

39:25.498 --> 39:28.065
And then fix them up?

39:28.066 --> 39:31.402
Yeah.

39:31.403 --> 39:36.173
Mustang?

39:36.174 --> 39:37.942
Camaro.

39:37.943 --> 39:41.512
Camaro.

39:41.513 --> 39:41.813
Firebird?

39:41.813 --> 39:42.648
Pontiac.

39:42.649 --> 39:45.483
That's a perfect L.A.
car right there.

39:45.484 --> 39:49.754
Is this a car club or
just people that come?

39:49.755 --> 39:51.822
We hang out this way.

39:51.823 --> 39:57.161
These are our friends.

39:57.162 --> 39:58.328
One last thing everybody has

39:58.329 --> 40:01.666
been telling me I have to try.

40:01.667 --> 40:05.503
Iranian take-out pizza.

40:05.504 --> 40:08.272
It comes with ketchup.

40:08.273 --> 40:10.941
What do you think
about Iranian pizza?

40:10.942 --> 40:11.810
Not bad.

40:11.810 --> 40:12.511
Not bad.

40:12.512 --> 40:15.145
We don't put ketchup
on pizza, though.

40:15.146 --> 40:20.184
I love ketchup.

40:20.185 --> 40:23.688
I could spend my youth,
pretty much, doing this.

40:23.689 --> 40:31.689
Hanging out in a parking lot?

40:36.234 --> 40:37.835
Let's assume the worst.

40:37.836 --> 40:40.204
Let's assume that you cannot see

40:40.205 --> 40:41.506
any way to reconcile what you

40:41.507 --> 40:47.011
think of Iran with your
own personal beliefs.

40:47.012 --> 40:48.412
You just generally
don't approve.

40:48.413 --> 40:48.914
Yeah.

40:48.915 --> 40:50.548
I think those are exactly the

40:50.549 --> 40:51.916
sort of places you should go.

40:51.917 --> 40:53.083
Totally.

40:53.084 --> 40:54.552
See who we're talking about

40:54.553 --> 40:56.887
and where we're
talking about here.

40:56.888 --> 41:00.390
I think it's almost un-American
not to go to those

41:00.391 --> 41:00.826
places.

41:00.826 --> 41:01.660
You know?

41:01.660 --> 41:02.594
I don't know that I can put

41:02.595 --> 41:04.862
it in any kind of perspective.

41:04.863 --> 41:07.865
I feel deeply conflicted.

41:07.866 --> 41:15.866
Deeply confusing, exhilarating,

41:17.576 --> 41:18.343
heartbreaking, beautiful place.

41:18.344 --> 41:21.912
Yeah.

41:21.913 --> 41:29.913
Exactly.

41:35.627 --> 41:37.027
American cars are crazy.

41:37.028 --> 41:45.028
American cars are crazy
and they're fun.

41:47.973 --> 41:49.807
The Iran I see on TV and read

41:49.808 --> 41:52.943
about in the papers, it's
a much bigger picture.

41:52.944 --> 41:58.783
Let's put it this way.

41:58.784 --> 42:06.784
It's complicated.

42:20.806 --> 42:24.474
After ten weeks, Yugane
was finally released.

42:24.475 --> 42:28.145
But as I read these lines,
Jason remains a prisoner.

42:28.146 --> 42:29.446
His future, the reasons for

42:29.447 --> 42:33.350
their arrest, are still unknown.

42:33.351 --> 42:36.854
One, two, three!

42:36.855 --> 42:38.422
Thank you, guys.

42:38.423 --> 42:42.492
We'll see you.

42:42.493 --> 42:48.299
Thank you.
