00:03.671 --> 00:06.255
[Announcer] Hulk Hogan hammering away!
[Continues, Indistinct]

00:06.340 --> 00:08.966
[Charlie] Get him, Hulk!
[Mac] Come on, Hulk!

00:09.051 --> 00:11.135
Ohh!
Hulk's the man.

00:11.220 --> 00:14.722
[Dee] I have a question though.
What's going on with Hulk Hogan's hair?

00:14.807 --> 00:17.892
It's blond, and yet it's silken
like that of a Chinese man.

00:17.976 --> 00:20.687
Ah. Yes. That is Hulk
Hogan's signature look...

00:20.771 --> 00:23.356
blond Chinese hair
and the skin of a hot dog.

00:23.440 --> 00:26.984
It's awesome. The whole thing's
fake, but it's really awesome.

00:27.069 --> 00:29.445
Fake? What the hell are you talking about?
It's not fake.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.489
Those guys got
bashed and bloodied.

00:31.615 --> 00:34.534
I've seen guys get pounded in the ring.
It's still fake though.

00:34.618 --> 00:36.828
Charlie, Charlie.
I was there once.

00:36.912 --> 00:40.373
I saw a guy pick up a trash can,
smash it into a guy's head.

00:40.457 --> 00:43.209
- Blood went everywhere.
- Okay, what is going on here?

00:43.293 --> 00:47.046
[Mac] Oh, yeah. Right here he's
going into a state of Hulkamania.

00:47.131 --> 00:50.591
When he's like this,
nothing can hurt him. Okay?

00:50.676 --> 00:53.219
It's like a seizure of strength.
[Dennis] Yeah. Yeah.

00:53.303 --> 00:57.056
What do we got here?
"Hey, sexy, I can't get you out of my mind."

00:57.141 --> 00:59.684
Who's that addressed to?
Who's Soldier of Fortune?

00:59.768 --> 01:02.145
He's just this guy I've been
chatting online with, whatever.

01:02.271 --> 01:04.897
Oh, so that would make you Desert Rose?
Yes, it would.

01:04.982 --> 01:08.234
- [Snorts]
- Wow. What a couple of losers.

01:08.318 --> 01:11.362
Oh! Oh, really? Well, this loser
that you're referring to...

01:11.447 --> 01:13.781
happens to be an
American soldier in Iraq.

01:13.866 --> 01:16.409
Back it up. Don't joke about that.
I'm not joking.

01:16.493 --> 01:18.119
- Are you serious?
- I'm dead serious.

01:18.203 --> 01:20.913
And his platoon's coming home this weekend,
and we're gonna hang out together,

01:20.998 --> 01:23.249
so suck on that.

01:23.375 --> 01:24.959
I feel terrible.
You should.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.712
I feel terrible too, 'cause
he's gonna come back from Iraq,

01:27.796 --> 01:30.256
and he's gonna find out
that he's been chattin' with...

01:30.382 --> 01:31.841
No.
That's no good.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.843
There's a high
suicide rate for these guys.

01:33.969 --> 01:36.637
He's gonna be crushed.
This is emblematic of a bigger problem, guys.

01:36.722 --> 01:39.265
I don't think people are proud
to be Americans anymore.

01:39.349 --> 01:40.683
Not like we were in the '80s.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.351
In the '80s,
we were so patriotic.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.270
When Hogan was doing
his thing...

01:44.354 --> 01:47.815
and we were killing Iranians
or whatever, we were proud.

01:47.900 --> 01:50.568
There's no fanfare.
There's no parades. Oh, yeah.

01:50.652 --> 01:53.738
- Girls are tricking troops on the Internet.
- Nobody's tricking anybody.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.740
We gotta do something
about this,

01:55.824 --> 01:58.284
'cause people just aren't showing
their appreciation for these guys.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.119
We gotta show 'em the love.
We gotta do something.

02:00.204 --> 02:01.913
Let's step it up.

02:02.039 --> 02:04.749
Let's be the guys that do something for the troops.
Let's put on a show or something.

02:04.833 --> 02:07.585
- [Frank] All right.
- Something with a little pizzazz.

02:07.669 --> 02:10.128
- Like a thank you for all your service.
- [Charlie] Yes!

02:10.214 --> 02:13.466
Something that celebrates the troops,
celebrates America, maybe celebrates us.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.468
I'm into that.
I know you are, dude.

02:15.552 --> 02:18.221
And what's the best way
to celebrate America, boys?

02:18.347 --> 02:22.058
[Announcer] Hulk Hogan is a man
possessed of a love of his country.

02:22.142 --> 02:25.978
# I am a real American #

02:26.063 --> 02:29.899
- # Fight for the rights of every man #
- 'Bout wrestling?

03:02.224 --> 03:05.309
[Charlie] Yeah!

03:05.394 --> 03:07.728
Yeah!

03:07.813 --> 03:09.522
Yeah, Maniac!

03:10.858 --> 03:13.776
- Get up, you son of a bitch!
- Yeah, Maniac!

03:13.902 --> 03:15.361
Thanks, bud.
There you go.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.363
So I booked this venue
for Friday night.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.031
[Charlie] You got this place?
Yeah.

03:19.116 --> 03:21.284
I told them it was for the troops.
They gave us a discount.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.286
Ho-ho! That is what I'm
talking about, dude.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.913
People wanna support the troops.
They don't have a venue to do it.

03:25.998 --> 03:28.457
Yeah, how are we
gonna do that though?

03:28.584 --> 03:31.377
None of us knows how to wrestle.
Wrong!

03:31.461 --> 03:33.963
Charlie and I do. We used to do
backyard wrestling all the time, dude.

03:34.089 --> 03:36.632
We were an awesome tag team.
That's right. We were the Pigeon Boys.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.634
Pigeon Boys!
[Squawking]

03:38.760 --> 03:40.970
Pigeon Boys? Doesn't sound
that cool now as an adult.

03:41.096 --> 03:43.055
You're right.
We gotta update it.

03:43.140 --> 03:46.893
Let's be eagles, dude. That's like
patriotic and fires on all cylinders.

03:46.977 --> 03:49.186
I feel like pigeons
are survivors though.

03:49.313 --> 03:51.480
I'm gonna side with Dennis
on this one, bro. Yeah.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.858
What do you say we get
this guy into the mix?

03:53.942 --> 03:56.652
- [Gasping] - He's probably
got some experience.

03:56.737 --> 04:00.072
- He could show us the ropes.
- [Gurgling]

04:00.157 --> 04:02.575
Oh, um, Mr. Maniac!
Mr. Maniac!

04:02.659 --> 04:05.620
- Mr. Maniac, excuse me.
- Somethin' I can do for you fellas?

04:05.746 --> 04:08.372
Yeah. Absolutely.
That was a great show in there, man.

04:08.498 --> 04:09.832
That was amazing!
Great show!

04:09.917 --> 04:11.417
That was so awesome!
You drank your own blood.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.377
- You were choking the guy-
- Just trying to put on a good show.

04:13.503 --> 04:16.714
Oh, you did. No, no, no, no.
Let me do you a favor.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.966
You're good kids, you know?
Hang on. Hang on.

04:19.051 --> 04:21.385
What are you getting, an autograph?
No, we're good, man.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.095
That's all right.
We don't need an autograph.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.264
[Dennis] We're actually here for
a different- God bless you.

04:25.349 --> 04:28.935
- You have a good time. You know, whale away.
- This is a parking ticket.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.562
You bet. You have fun
with it, okay?

04:31.647 --> 04:33.064
Actually, sir, um...

04:33.148 --> 04:35.900
I don't know if this is too
forward to ask you this,

04:35.984 --> 04:37.944
but we're putting
on a wrestling match...

04:38.028 --> 04:40.112
for the troops coming home
from overseas,

04:40.197 --> 04:42.114
and we were thinking maybe we
can get you to wrestle in it.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.241
How much?

04:44.368 --> 04:46.118
Ooh. We haven't discussed that.
How much?

04:46.203 --> 04:48.537
- How much do you usually charge?
- Thirty bucks weekdays,

04:48.622 --> 04:50.289
50 bucks weekends.

04:50.374 --> 04:52.249
Is that it?
Reasonable.

04:52.376 --> 04:53.793
That we can do.
Reasonable.

04:53.919 --> 04:55.962
Yeah. Now.
Absolutely.

04:56.088 --> 04:58.714
Now. All right. Give him some money.
Give that to him now.

04:58.799 --> 05:02.343
I suppose- All right.
Oh, boy. That's okay.

05:07.724 --> 05:12.061
[Frank] Whoa! Yo!
Deandra! Yo! Deandra!

05:12.145 --> 05:14.855
Yes, Frank. Yes, yes. I can hear you.
What are you doing here?

05:14.940 --> 05:18.567
I'm gonna use the army guy to get the
word out about the wrestling match.

05:18.694 --> 05:21.237
[Scoffs] Why are you
dressed like that?

05:21.321 --> 05:23.322
Well, my chat name
was Desert Rose.

05:23.407 --> 05:25.324
So I dressed like a rose.
I'm gonna give him a rose.

05:25.409 --> 05:27.618
And I'm gonna play "Kiss
From a Rose" by Seal.

05:27.703 --> 05:30.037
I got a whole thing I'm doing here.
Can you please get out?

05:30.122 --> 05:34.667
Oh. The boys and I got him a
little welcome-home gift.

05:34.751 --> 05:37.962
Jean shorts? You bought him
a pair of jean shorts?

05:38.088 --> 05:40.297
Yeah.
Goddamn it, Frank.

05:40.382 --> 05:43.426
You guys are gonna have plenty of time to
ruin this for me at some point in the future.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.428
Can you please let me
get it started first?

05:45.512 --> 05:47.847
Hey! Desert Rose!

05:47.931 --> 05:50.057
It's me, Ben.

05:50.142 --> 05:53.686
[Whirring]

05:59.901 --> 06:03.320
It's so nice to finally meet
you in person, Desert Rose.

06:03.405 --> 06:06.490
Yeah. Oh, no!

06:06.575 --> 06:10.036
Because...
I'm not Desert Rose.

06:10.120 --> 06:13.539
[Nervous Chuckle]
I, uh- I'm a friend.

06:13.623 --> 06:15.833
I'm a friend of hers.
Great girl.

06:15.917 --> 06:18.294
Uh, she just wanted me
to come here...

06:18.378 --> 06:20.379
so that I could tell you...

06:20.464 --> 06:24.717
that she wasn't gonna be
able to show up here today.

06:24.801 --> 06:29.138
Oh, well, with the dress and
the rose, I thought that you...

06:29.222 --> 06:32.391
You thought- Yeah. Yeah.
Well, of course you thought that.

06:32.476 --> 06:35.352
You thought it because of
this and the- It's fine.

06:35.437 --> 06:36.937
Don't blame yourself.

06:37.022 --> 06:40.191
You're not- You're not dumb.
You just...

06:40.275 --> 06:43.819
Um, so-
All right, well...

06:47.324 --> 06:48.657
[Chuckles]

06:50.160 --> 06:54.705
# There used to be a graying
tower alone on the sea #.

06:54.790 --> 06:58.626
I, uh, wanna invite you
to a wrestling match.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.087
Oh.
And, uh, the guys...

07:01.171 --> 07:04.256
we all chipped in
to get you these, uh...

07:04.341 --> 07:07.676
Uh, this is a coming-home present.
Uh...

07:09.596 --> 07:12.223
There you go.
[Sighs]

07:14.976 --> 07:17.061
And thank you for your service.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.191
# Baby #

07:22.275 --> 07:26.612
# I compare you to a kiss
from a rose on the gray #

07:26.696 --> 07:29.073
# Ooh, the more I get of you #

07:29.157 --> 07:32.118
# The stranger it feels Yeah ##.

07:35.288 --> 07:40.459
No! I don't give a rat's ass
about your collection agency,

07:40.544 --> 07:45.005
and as for the $15 co-payment,
eat shit and die!

07:45.090 --> 07:48.300
[Grunting] Ah, shit!

07:50.512 --> 07:53.139
Sorry. I'm gonna
go get greased up,

07:53.223 --> 07:57.184
and then, uh,
I'll come back and rock on.

08:01.898 --> 08:04.942
Fifteen dollars?
He's upset about $15?

08:05.068 --> 08:06.277
Yeah.
Smashing our phone.

08:06.403 --> 08:08.028
Not a lot of money.
Let's move past it for now.

08:08.113 --> 08:10.531
Let's focus on our stuff.
Let's focus on our...

08:10.615 --> 08:13.826
The most important part of
our routine is the entrance.

08:13.952 --> 08:14.952
Yes.
Yes. Absolutely.

08:15.036 --> 08:15.995
[Crash] Whoa!

08:16.121 --> 08:19.081
Ahhhh! Frank, what the
hell are you doing?

08:19.166 --> 08:23.419
Ahhh! It's my character.
I'm the Trash Man.

08:23.503 --> 08:27.381
I come out.
I throw trash all over the ring.

08:27.465 --> 08:29.508
And then I start
eating garbage.

08:29.593 --> 08:31.844
And then I pick up
the trash can...

08:31.928 --> 08:33.929
and I bash the guy on the head.

08:34.054 --> 08:36.056
Oh, that's gonna be a disaster.
No, no.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.058
Nobody's gonna get hurt.
I'm telling you...

08:38.143 --> 08:40.059
Like you said, it's all fake.

08:40.145 --> 08:41.687
But it has nothing
to do with the troops, Frank.

08:41.770 --> 08:44.523
A 60-year-old man eating trash?
Who wants to see that?

08:44.608 --> 08:46.400
But that's what people want.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.903
Hey, I got something for you.
I got a character for you.

08:48.987 --> 08:50.905
You can be the ref.

08:50.989 --> 08:54.325
I'm not gonna be the ref.
I'm a villain. Don't you see?

08:54.409 --> 08:56.994
Look, I got garbage, and I-
[Chomping]

08:57.078 --> 08:59.705
- [Mac] Oh, Frank!
- That's nasty, dude.

08:59.831 --> 09:02.666
[Coughing] Are you choking?

09:02.751 --> 09:05.085
- Oh, my God. - [Mac, Charlie]
Throw it up in the bathroom!

09:05.170 --> 09:08.047
- Get out of here! - [Dennis] Go take a break.
Go take a break.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.174
The troops are gonna be
very happy to see that.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.384
All right, let's get-
Look at this mess.

09:12.469 --> 09:14.637
Let's get back to it.
Charlie...

09:14.721 --> 09:16.722
So we're talking
about the entrances, okay?

09:16.806 --> 09:18.641
We got a good idea.
We got a good idea.

09:18.725 --> 09:21.894
They're gonna announce our name.
Birds of War.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.938
I love that new name.
I love it. Yeah.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.190
And maybe we'll do an eagle screech.
[Screeches] That'll be great.

09:26.316 --> 09:28.400
[Shrieks] And then we'll
come out of the tunnel.

09:28.485 --> 09:31.237
We'll start a stomp, clap.
Stomp, clap.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.322
Stomp, stomp, clap.
Stomp, clap.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.950
And we're gonna write this great song.
It's gonna be about had badass we are.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.911
But tell him about the- Oh, yeah.
About how we soar through the air,

09:38.995 --> 09:41.914
how we live in a nest, how we like
to protect our eggs from predators.

09:41.998 --> 09:43.666
And our young.
We regurgitate, dude.

09:43.792 --> 09:46.502
Can I stop you guys for one second?
Mm-hmm.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.504
What you just described,

09:48.588 --> 09:51.423
that seems like we're singing
about the lifestyle of an eagle.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.217
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

09:53.301 --> 09:56.011
I was under the impression that we
were presenting ourselves as birdmen,

09:56.096 --> 09:58.555
which, to me,
is infinitely cooler...

09:58.682 --> 10:01.308
than just sort of being a bird.
No, no, no, no, no.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.519
It's good.
We can meet in the middle though.

10:03.645 --> 10:06.438
We'll meet you somewhere in the middle.
That's all I ask.

10:06.523 --> 10:09.400
I want people to be able to see
that we're not just birds.

10:09.484 --> 10:11.694
Yeah.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.781
[Artemis]
Hey-hey.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.950
Hi. Thank you for stepping
in as Desert Rose.

10:18.034 --> 10:21.203
Ah, no problem. I've dated a lot
of disabled men in my past.

10:21.329 --> 10:24.373
So- [Clicks Tongue] I enjoy the power.
Why aren't you wearing red?

10:24.499 --> 10:26.709
I was very specific about that.
I don't do red.

10:26.835 --> 10:29.670
Well, you look like a grape. Fine.
Then I'll be Desert Grape.

10:29.754 --> 10:32.464
He wasn't talking to Desert Grape.
He was talking to Desert Rose.

10:32.549 --> 10:35.592
That's very specific, and-
You know what? All right.

10:35.677 --> 10:39.096
This is what we'll do.
I'll just put this... here.

10:39.222 --> 10:41.598
Oh. You're sweaty. Oh. Okay.
It's humid outside.

10:41.725 --> 10:45.060
So, uh, which one is he?
Right behind you, in the yellow.

10:45.186 --> 10:47.563
Oh, Mama like.
Cute, right?

10:47.647 --> 10:50.816
Did he send you any dick pics?
'Cause it could be a mess down there.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.068
For the love of God, please
don't ask him about his dick.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.696
Okay. Have it your way.
I'll figure it out soon enough.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.743
And away we go.

11:01.745 --> 11:03.829
[Sighs] She looks ridiculous.

11:03.913 --> 11:06.123
Desert Rose?
Yeah.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.876
- Hi.
- What? What the hell?

11:08.960 --> 11:11.337
It feels so good
to finally hold you.

11:11.421 --> 11:14.465
Uh- Uh, you're-
you're biting my lip.

11:14.549 --> 11:17.968
Hi. Oh!
What a coincidence.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.679
Hey, oh- Oh. You're that girl
from the bus stop. Yes, I am.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.556
You guys are friends, right?

11:22.682 --> 11:23.766
Mm-hmm.
Not really.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.477
Well, tell your friend
thanks for the shorts.

11:26.561 --> 11:28.270
They fit great.
Yeah.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.939
Will do. So, what's...

11:31.024 --> 11:32.524
What's the deal
with you standing?

11:32.609 --> 11:35.527
I thought there was a
wheelchair and you were in it.

11:35.612 --> 11:39.365
Oh, no. No. I twisted my knee
getting of a plane in Germany.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.742
I was just trying
to stay off of it.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.452
It's good now.
Oh!

11:43.536 --> 11:46.747
Yes, it is.
Can I talk to you for a second?

11:46.873 --> 11:48.916
I'll be back. What? What?
What? I changed my mind.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.959
So move out of the way
so I can swoop in.

11:51.086 --> 11:54.213
Uh-uh. No changeys. What?
Artemis, I'm warning you.

11:54.297 --> 11:56.715
If you don't get out of the way,
I'm gonna bring out the big guns.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.968
Oh, hit me with your best
shot, you stupid bitch.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.305
[Ben] Ah.

12:06.309 --> 12:09.144
I was looking around.
I was thinking.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.522
I- I brought some-
Ohh!

12:11.648 --> 12:13.148
Oh.
[Maniac] Oh.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.983
You just hit-
I'm sorry about that.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.735
Just props that I was bringing.

12:16.820 --> 12:19.196
That's not a prop though.
That's sharp razor wire.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.323
Mr., uh, Maniac,
we were thinking...

12:21.408 --> 12:23.283
maybe we could go a little
bit more traditional with it.

12:23.410 --> 12:27.830
Just figure-four leg-locks, pile drivers, body slams.
Off the top rope, suplex...

12:27.914 --> 12:31.875
No, no, no. People, that old-school
bullshit, that don't play no more.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.920
Really? Yeah.
It's gotta be gruesome, you know?

12:35.004 --> 12:37.423
Those people,
they like blood, you know?

12:37.507 --> 12:39.425
I guess.
Well, guys like you...

12:39.509 --> 12:42.136
You know what?
I love you guys.

12:42.220 --> 12:45.514
You know,
you remind me of my kids.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.599
You got kids, Maniac?

12:50.645 --> 12:53.188
Nah. Not anymore.

12:54.858 --> 12:56.859
- What does that mean?
- [Mouthing Words]

12:58.695 --> 13:00.529
All right.
We got a problem.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.531
What is he talking about
with his kids?

13:02.615 --> 13:05.200
- Did he kill his kids? Is that what happened?
- He just drifted away.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.287
And look at this.
I feel like he's living out of his car.

13:08.371 --> 13:11.165
- He's got blankets. What is that, a
pile of laundry? - Look at this, dude.

13:11.249 --> 13:13.041
That's just
a bucket of chestnuts.

13:13.168 --> 13:15.419
Who has- What?
Is he foraging for his food?

13:15.503 --> 13:18.547
I don't know. Why the hell would
you have a bucket of chestnuts?

13:18.631 --> 13:21.049
We are dealing with a legitimate maniac now.
That is clear to me.

13:21.176 --> 13:23.135
His mania is not confined
to the ring. Ahh!

13:23.261 --> 13:25.387
He kept calling you the
"N" word earlier. Yeah.

13:25.513 --> 13:27.556
I wasn't gonna bring that up.
I didn't wanna freak him out. Me?

13:27.682 --> 13:29.516
Yes. He was calling
me the "N" word?

13:29.601 --> 13:31.101
Yes. Every time
you turned your back.

13:31.186 --> 13:32.936
He was like, "You stupid 'N.
' Go get me grease, 'N."'

13:33.062 --> 13:34.188
"N" this, "N" that.
Why?

13:34.272 --> 13:36.690
I don't know.
He has a problem with black people.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.650
Or does he have a problem with me?
Both.

13:38.776 --> 13:40.944
I don't know. I don't know.
Oh, my God.

13:41.070 --> 13:43.780
Let's get rid of him. That's it.
How do you get rid of a guy like that?

13:43.865 --> 13:45.908
I don't wanna be anywhere
in the ring with that guy.

13:45.992 --> 13:49.578
What if we're just hype men?
We don't even go in the ring.

13:49.704 --> 13:51.371
Yes. We let him do the wrestling.
We do not wrestle.

13:51.498 --> 13:54.208
No. We gotta find someone
for him to wrestle though.

13:54.292 --> 13:55.542
Right. Right.

13:55.668 --> 13:59.046
Someone with, you know,
nothing to lose, right? Yeah.

14:02.884 --> 14:04.843
[Dennis] Cricket!
[Charlie] What's up, Cricket?

14:04.928 --> 14:07.346
- [All] Cricket!
- No!

14:07.430 --> 14:09.306
Cricket, cricket,
cricket, crickety.

14:09.432 --> 14:11.183
What do you want from me?
We want you to wrestle...

14:11.267 --> 14:13.185
at a wrestling match
that we're gonna throw.

14:13.269 --> 14:14.937
No. How about that?

14:15.063 --> 14:17.814
I'm not gonna participate in your little
games and schemes. [Charlie] Cricket.

14:17.899 --> 14:19.775
It's for the troops.
Yeah.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.652
I don't give a shit
about the troops.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.570
Come on, man. Oh!
We're gonna pay you, bro.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.239
We're gonna pay you.
There's pay involved.

14:25.323 --> 14:27.032
You give a shit
about that, Cricket?

14:27.158 --> 14:29.368
You payin'?
Yeah, man.

14:29.452 --> 14:32.496
Oh, I see.
So, am I gonna get my ass kicked?

14:32.622 --> 14:35.457
Ah! It's wrestling.
It's all fake.

14:35.583 --> 14:40.128
It's relatively fake.
What happens in the ring is really up to you.

14:46.427 --> 14:49.221
I don't feel
we're reading as eagles.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.431
No, bro.
We look like assholes.

14:51.558 --> 14:55.060
They didn't turn out the way that I had envisioned.
I'm getting more of a chicken vibe.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.980
Whoo! Whoa!

14:58.106 --> 15:00.649
What in God's name is this about?
[Dennis] All right.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.360
Don't start. We're birdmen.
We're Birds of War.

15:03.486 --> 15:05.237
Birdmen.
What do you want?

15:05.321 --> 15:08.448
Yeah. Okay. I wanna sing "The
Star-Spangled Banner" before the match.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.701
Yeah. Good. Sing. We don't care.
Do whatever you want.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.411
Just get away. We're obviously
in the middle of something.

15:12.537 --> 15:13.537
Okay?
Yeah.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.205
Get out of here.

15:15.331 --> 15:17.916
Wait a second, Charlie.
Do that again. That?

15:18.042 --> 15:20.460
That looked pretty cool.
Maybe we can go with the chicken thing.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.921
The Chicken Boys.
We're not changing the song.

15:23.006 --> 15:26.300
We got a big problem with the Maniac.
Big problem with the Maniac.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.552
[Siren Wails] [Dennis] What did he do?
Did he kill somebody?

15:28.678 --> 15:31.597
Unpaid parking tickets.
Unpaid parking tickets?

15:31.681 --> 15:35.434
- Maniac!
- Oh, my boys. My boys.

15:35.518 --> 15:38.353
Ohh! Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

15:38.438 --> 15:42.482
You know what?
Da' Maniac loves you.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.943
Even with your fea- Wait, wait!
Even with your feathers!

15:45.028 --> 15:46.612
Aw!
I love you!

15:46.738 --> 15:48.614
I love you too, man.
I love you t...

15:48.740 --> 15:51.158
Poor guy. I don't really love him.
I don't love him at all.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.910
I'm terrified of him.
Look, you guys need a wrestler now.

15:54.037 --> 15:56.455
We should take the Trash Man
out of retirement. No, dude!

15:56.581 --> 16:00.000
[Growling] That is not going to happen.
But we do need a wrestler.

16:00.126 --> 16:02.085
I know. Guys, I'm thinking
maybe we should do it.

16:02.211 --> 16:05.172
Yeah. Right? We got the costumes.
We got the passion.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.341
We are just battling Cricket.
It's just Cricket.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.092
Pigeon Boys, let's do this!

16:09.218 --> 16:11.094
No, we're not the Pigeon Boys.
Birds of War.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.471
Chicken Boys!
No.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.431
Are we sticking with the eagles?
Yes. We're Birds of War.

16:14.557 --> 16:16.642
Let's go with birdmen.
We don't even look like eagles.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.852

what kind of bird we would be.

Hey, troops!
Hey, guys!

16:58.976 --> 17:00.894
Drop a beat for us.
You ready?

17:47.984 --> 17:49.526
The whole second verse
is completely ridiculous.

17:49.610 --> 17:51.528
The second verse is necessary
to clarify what we are.

17:51.654 --> 17:53.447
We're miked. We're miked.
We're not...

17:53.573 --> 17:55.240
