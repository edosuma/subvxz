WEBVTT

00:08.425 --> 00:11.678
If the millage does not pass,
we are losing bodies.

00:13.304 --> 00:16.140
They're projecting that
we're gonna lose at least 20 positions.

00:16.224 --> 00:18.560
Before this millage, the people were told

00:18.643 --> 00:23.106
they were gonna get a lot of new cops
and more safety on the streets.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.316
It's time to stand up and say,

00:25.400 --> 00:28.278
"We gave it to you last time
and we're still in the same boat."

00:28.361 --> 00:31.114
<i>Crime rate's high.</i>
<i>Police aren't showing up.</i>

00:31.197 --> 00:34.993
If you're not doing what you're supposed
to with the funding you already have,

00:35.076 --> 00:37.203
why should anyone give you more?

00:37.287 --> 00:42.041
If the millage does not pass, we will not
be able to support the staff that we have.

00:42.542 --> 00:45.253
Bridgette and I live together.
That's our income.

00:45.587 --> 00:47.464
<i>If it gets to me, it got to her already.</i>

00:47.547 --> 00:49.799
People are fed up. Everybody's broke.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.509
We must get this millage.

00:52.010 --> 00:54.179
I can't even imagine what I would do.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.556
It might not pass.

-Yeah.

01:16.993 --> 01:18.661
-[Robert] Cream?
-[Bridgette] Yeah.

01:19.871 --> 01:22.749

[Donald Trump on TV]
<i>I'll tell you what's going on.</i>

01:26.836 --> 01:29.839
<i>Today, we are going to win</i>
<i>the great state of Michigan</i>

01:29.923 --> 01:34.302
<i>and we are going</i>
<i>to win back the White House.</i>

01:34.886 --> 01:37.514
<i>For a once-in-a-lifetime change.</i>

01:37.597 --> 01:41.226
<i>We're going to have real change,</i>
<i>not "Obama" change.</i>

01:42.852 --> 01:46.022
<i>There's a movement like</i>
<i>what's never happened in this country.</i>

01:46.105 --> 01:48.733
[crowd cheering over TV]

01:48.817 --> 01:50.777
So it's now officially

01:51.319 --> 01:54.697
Tuesday, November 8th.

01:58.284 --> 02:01.454
[woman] Go in either door.
Precinct Five is open.

02:04.165 --> 02:08.127
This historic race for president is now
in the hands of voters across the country.

02:08.211 --> 02:11.714
[reporter] <i> Hillary Clinton returned home</i>
<i>to New York around 3:20 a.m.</i>

02:11.798 --> 02:14.259
[reporter #2] <i> Donald Trump arrived here</i>
<i>to cast his vote.</i>

02:14.342 --> 02:17.971
[reporter #3] <i> Over the last 24 hours,</i>
<i>this has really been a celebration.</i>

02:18.054 --> 02:20.932
[reporter #4] <i> The Trump campaign</i>
<i>obviously has an uphill climb.</i>

02:21.015 --> 02:22.225
One minute to show.

02:22.308 --> 02:24.561
[reporter #5]
<i>Michigan is a critical state.</i>

02:24.644 --> 02:28.523
<i>It voted Democratic</i>
<i>in the last six presidential elections.</i>

02:29.065 --> 02:32.402
<i>But despite this, Trump's camp</i>
<i>is remaining optimistic.</i>

02:33.153 --> 02:35.989
Besides the presidential candidates,
voters in Flint

02:36.072 --> 02:39.450
also have two public safety millages
on their ballots.

02:39.534 --> 02:44.706
The millages are renewals, so taxpayers
won't see any changes if they're approved.

02:44.789 --> 02:48.334
But if they don't pass,
both the fire and police chiefs say

02:48.418 --> 02:50.253
they will have to lay people off.

02:53.756 --> 02:55.717
[Wayne] Chad and Mycross, east.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.594
Patterson and Buzick, west.

02:57.677 --> 03:01.890
Lee, you're gonna be helping Devon
supervise up in the north.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.642
Willingham and Terry Lewis, south.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.769
Snyder and Johnson, north.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.064
There's been talk
about intimidation of voters

03:10.148 --> 03:13.860
up to and including
LaPierre Militia coming down

03:13.943 --> 03:17.822
to intimidate voters with open carry
and those silly masks that they wear.

03:18.156 --> 03:19.782
Here's how it breaks down.

03:19.866 --> 03:22.827
All the precincts
are gonna mark off 100 feet,

03:22.911 --> 03:26.497
and there can't be any shenanigans
within that, whether it's public or not,

03:26.581 --> 03:28.207
because it's voting domain today.

03:29.083 --> 03:32.337
So, I guess we're just gonna be
out and about patrolling.

03:32.420 --> 03:36.341
If you need to vote, by all means,
it's your God-given right to vote,

03:36.424 --> 03:39.636
so let me know and you can just break
at your normal time.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.846
Alright, that's all I got. Thank you.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.148
-[man] <i>He came in.</i>
-[Bridgette] <i>Is he nervous?</i>

03:52.232 --> 03:53.066
[man] <i>No.</i>

03:54.025 --> 03:57.654
Bill said he's chomping at the bit.
"Let's get this interview going."

03:58.947 --> 04:01.991
[man] He said something about,
Frank came and switched vehicles,

04:02.533 --> 04:04.202
jumped in the Blazer...

04:04.285 --> 04:06.412
Everybody knew he was going to Starlight

04:06.496 --> 04:09.707
because he was gonna go up there,
you know what I'm saying?

04:09.791 --> 04:12.627
I mean, they had beef
with a lot of people, man.

04:14.045 --> 04:17.048
[Bridgette] <i>People say they don't see</i>
<i>how this city is gonna function</i>

04:17.130 --> 04:19.550
<i>if we lose 20, 30 officers.</i>

04:24.722 --> 04:27.433
But who knows?
Maybe they will only lay off full-timers.

04:27.517 --> 04:30.812
So that means that will take out
half the sergeants!

04:30.895 --> 04:33.648
There's enough mistrust
that they're gonna be like...

04:34.190 --> 04:35.316
I don't know.

04:35.400 --> 04:39.779
This water thing has just
really put us over the top.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.950
It's gonna be interesting to see
what these next few months bring.

04:44.534 --> 04:47.245
[Bridgette] Oh, my God. No...

04:47.870 --> 04:51.291
[tense ambient music playing]

05:01.551 --> 05:05.221
[Dion] What, is this, like,
a master suite or something?

05:06.014 --> 05:08.224
[ultrasound tech]
You can leave your shoes on.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.560
I change it after everyone
so you don't have to.

05:12.270 --> 05:13.938
Oh, it's so comfortable.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.526
-[Dion] Are you nervous?
-No, I'm happy.

05:22.488 --> 05:25.241
-[Dion] Where's your phone at?
-[Jazmin] It's right here.

05:27.368 --> 05:29.662
[phone beeping]

05:30.413 --> 05:34.000
-[Maria] <i>I'm in the shower.</i>
-[Dion] I thought you were sleeping.

05:34.417 --> 05:35.668
Are you going to watch?

05:36.294 --> 05:41.966
[Maria] <i>I'm gonna watch it. I just stepped</i>
<i>out of the shower so I'm naked. Show me.</i>

05:43.676 --> 05:44.719

05:45.470 --> 05:46.471
What, baby?

05:48.514 --> 05:51.601
[Maria] <i>Uh-oh.</i>
<i>She's pointing at something.</i>

05:51.684 --> 05:53.936
-[ultrasound tech] It's a girl.
-[Dion] Huh?

05:54.020 --> 05:55.396
[ultrasound tech] It's a girl!

05:55.480 --> 05:56.647
[woman laughter]

05:56.731 --> 05:57.815
[Maria] <i>Girl?</i>

05:57.899 --> 06:00.526
I don't know. I heard everybody
say that, so I guess so.

06:01.611 --> 06:02.820
It's a girl.

06:03.362 --> 06:05.073
You're having a sister.

06:06.699 --> 06:09.035
[Maria] <i>Well, congratulations,</i>
<i>Daddy and Mommy.</i>

06:09.410 --> 06:11.829
-[Dion] Thank you.
-[tech] Congratulations.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.081
[Dion] Thank you.

06:13.164 --> 06:15.541
-A baby.
-Yeah, a baby.

06:16.501 --> 06:20.254
[fetus' heart beating over monitor]

06:20.338 --> 06:24.217
If I get laid off, I feel like
it's gonna put everything on pause.

06:26.010 --> 06:27.470
<i>I just hope it passes.</i>

06:30.473 --> 06:33.851
[Jazmin] <i>Yeah, it concerns me.</i>
<i>You know, Dion being, like, new.</i>

06:36.020 --> 06:39.190
He's worked so hard and so long for this.

06:39.273 --> 06:42.151
And, like, to get it,
and then have it taken away...

06:44.529 --> 06:49.659
[fetus' heart beating over monitor]

06:52.995 --> 06:57.625
[gunshots]

07:03.005 --> 07:05.550
Slow her down on that last guy.
You got lucky.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.761
There it is. That was good.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.471
Scan and... there you go.

07:12.348 --> 07:16.769
[Lewis] <i> I was never really a bad guy.</i>
<i>I wanted to be on the good side.</i>

07:17.437 --> 07:20.064
-Slow squeeze, right?
-Yeah.

07:20.148 --> 07:23.109
[Lewis] <i> So I figured</i>
<i>getting involved with the police,</i>

07:23.192 --> 07:25.403
<i>and to try to let the community see</i>

07:25.486 --> 07:28.030
<i>there's nothing wrong</i>
<i>with being a police officer.</i>

07:31.159 --> 07:32.326
[instructor] Here we go.

07:32.410 --> 07:35.455
On the buzzer, one round, each target,
and then return to cover.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.707
One round, each target, on the buzzer.

07:40.209 --> 07:41.919
[buzzer]

07:45.631 --> 07:48.885
Cease fire, cease fire, cease fire.
Don't lean over. There you go.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.845
-[instructor] Reholster.
-[Lewis] OK.

07:52.221 --> 07:53.306
[instructor] Step back.

07:53.389 --> 07:55.850
You must have hit that marker.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.229
Alright, Lewis, here we go.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.647
[buzzer]

08:05.818 --> 08:07.195
[gunshot]

08:12.617 --> 08:14.368
[Robert] It was that last one.

08:14.452 --> 08:16.537
[instructor] That was
the very last shot, huh?

08:18.956 --> 08:22.001
Lewis, why don't you sit out
and let everyone pass through?

08:22.084 --> 08:25.421
Then we'll give you a bit of remedial.
You got one more try to shoot it.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.716
But, I mean, hell, damn close.
It's one off.

08:28.799 --> 08:31.719
-[Lewis] Where's the other one?
-[instructor] All the rest are in.

08:31.802 --> 08:33.011
OK.

08:36.265 --> 08:39.727
Sergeant Frost told me... He said,
"Don't be doing that with the gun..."

08:39.809 --> 08:40.686
[man] Oh, God.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.855

08:46.651 --> 08:48.277
[Robert] <i>I'm really tired.</i>

08:50.905 --> 08:53.032
<i>I want to be able to be secure someplace.</i>

08:54.408 --> 08:57.578
<i>I want to be able to do everything else</i>
<i>that everybody else gets to do.</i>

08:59.872 --> 09:04.418
<i>It doesn't matter how hard you work here.</i>
<i>If your number's up, you're up.</i>

09:08.714 --> 09:11.592
[Robert] Another thing you can do, OK,
with an empty gun...

09:12.718 --> 09:14.178
With an empty gun, OK?

09:16.055 --> 09:18.182
Put that on there. Hold it out.

09:18.933 --> 09:19.976
[trigger clicks]

09:20.059 --> 09:22.812
You should pull that trigger
without that thing falling off.

09:23.229 --> 09:27.024
It helps teach you to keep the gun still,

09:28.609 --> 09:30.319
while you pull the trigger.

09:30.861 --> 09:31.696
[trigger clicks]

09:31.779 --> 09:35.533
[Robert] Just let it go off.
That gun will not hurt you, OK?

09:35.992 --> 09:37.285
[gunshot echoes]

09:38.494 --> 09:42.248
So, I got one more chance you say?
One more chance to qualify?

09:42.331 --> 09:43.541
[Robert] Yeah.

09:43.624 --> 09:45.793
And if I don't make it,
what will happen?

09:45.876 --> 09:47.753
We'll get you back another day.

09:48.546 --> 09:49.589
[Robert] Like I said...

09:49.672 --> 09:52.758
-I'll be able to graduate?
-[Robert] Absolutely. You'll graduate.

09:52.842 --> 09:54.760
You just won't be carrying a gun.

09:54.844 --> 09:57.263
-At graduation? I can't carry no gun?
-Right.

09:57.346 --> 09:58.472
[Lewis] Really?

10:04.562 --> 10:08.733
[Robert] <i> I'm still a cop at heart,</i>
<i>whether I'm training or running calls.</i>

10:08.816 --> 10:10.735
<i>It's all about being out there.</i>

10:16.365 --> 10:19.910
<i>Fourteen years in law enforcement, and</i>
<i>to be starting over again someplace else.</i>

10:25.666 --> 10:28.753
[Robert] Same thing. You just did it.
Now you've got to do it one more time.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.339
[instructor] Load your magazine.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.804
One round, each target, on the buzzer.

10:40.598 --> 10:41.932
[buzzer]

10:44.393 --> 10:47.021
[gunshots echo]

10:47.104 --> 10:49.482
And cover. Low ready.

10:50.107 --> 10:52.568
From the crouch, two rounds each target.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.196
Two rounds, each target, on the buzzer.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.490
[buzzer]

10:58.366 --> 11:00.076
[gunshots echo]

11:04.955 --> 11:05.831
They're all in.

11:07.208 --> 11:10.419
-Congratulations. You just qualified.
-[Lewis] Oh, damn!

11:10.503 --> 11:13.547
[both laugh]

11:13.631 --> 11:16.217
-Thanks. I appreciate you, man.
-[Robert] Yeah.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.177
Appreciate you.

11:18.260 --> 11:19.303
[Lewis shouts] You guys!

11:19.387 --> 11:21.263
Yeah, baby, how you doing?

11:22.890 --> 11:26.310
[atmospheric hip hop music playing]

11:29.105 --> 11:32.066
Moving along, getting right
to your Election Day forecast,

11:32.149 --> 11:35.277
temperatures getting in the upper 50s
by about two o'clock.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.696
[Ilse] In Genesee County,
we've got the sheriff's race

11:38.155 --> 11:40.533
and the Flint Police safety millage.

11:40.616 --> 11:42.993
<i>City clerks have been preparing</i>
<i>for this day,</i>

11:43.077 --> 11:45.996
<i>and a lot of these folks</i>
<i>have been telling me that they are ready</i>

11:46.080 --> 11:48.249
<i>for this election to be over.</i>

11:55.172 --> 12:00.094
[chattering]

12:02.721 --> 12:05.599
[Drew] <i>The people in Flint</i>
<i>are feeling disenfranchised</i>

12:05.683 --> 12:07.643
<i>about politics, or ballots in general.</i>

12:09.061 --> 12:11.522
The whole voting thing is,
I'm not gonna say "rigged,"

12:11.605 --> 12:15.025
but I'm gonna say,
who they want to win is gonna win.

12:15.109 --> 12:18.737
Let alone, when you get into something
as complex or as minute as a millage,

12:18.821 --> 12:21.407
how can they worry
about something like that

12:21.490 --> 12:25.161
when they have to worry about making it
to a water distribution site

12:25.244 --> 12:27.037
so that they have a case of water?

12:28.164 --> 12:30.916
[woman] <i>No. No, I don't trust the police.</i>

12:31.542 --> 12:33.544
As many times as they helped me,

12:33.627 --> 12:36.255
there's been that many more times
that they haven't.

12:36.338 --> 12:40.301
You know, it surprises me
when people complain to me

12:40.384 --> 12:44.555
that it might take two, three hours
after dialing 911

12:44.638 --> 12:46.307
to get a police response.

12:46.390 --> 12:49.185
Well, do you want it to go
to five or six hours?

12:49.268 --> 12:50.561
You need this money.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.646
You ask me what I'll vote...

12:54.273 --> 12:55.774
I'd vote no.

12:56.775 --> 13:01.572
Because in all honesty, they really don't
do much anyways besides pullovers.

13:01.655 --> 13:05.409
<i>"You were going five miles over. You have</i>
<i>a cracked windshield. Your blinker out."</i>

13:05.743 --> 13:08.746
<i>They chase petty stuff,</i>
<i>so I'll lay all of them off.</i>

13:09.997 --> 13:13.792
There's so much on the shoulders
of someone living in Flint right now

13:13.876 --> 13:17.379
that I feel like a lot of them
are just withdrawing and pulling back

13:17.463 --> 13:19.423
and saying, "It just doesn't matter.

13:19.507 --> 13:22.968
Why vote? because even when I voted
last time, look what happened to me now.

13:23.802 --> 13:25.846
<i>So what difference does it really make?"</i>

13:30.351 --> 13:31.727
[operator] <i> Genesee County 911.</i>

13:31.810 --> 13:34.355
[woman] <i>Yeah, there's a fire down here.</i>

13:34.813 --> 13:37.983
[operator] <i> The fire department</i>
<i>is on their way to you right now.</i>

13:39.735 --> 13:41.445
[sirens wailing]

13:41.529 --> 13:45.157
That lady said that her kid is out...

13:47.493 --> 13:50.162
[glass shattering]

13:52.331 --> 13:54.333
[firefighter shouts] Grab that ladder!

13:58.003 --> 14:02.591
[shouting]

14:05.010 --> 14:09.223
[glass and metal cracking]

14:15.563 --> 14:16.855
[firefighter] Get out!

14:18.274 --> 14:22.486
[tense music playing]

14:23.237 --> 14:24.655
[firefighter] What's the matter?

14:30.828 --> 14:32.454
[firefighter] Come on out!

14:40.129 --> 14:43.966
[shouting]

14:44.049 --> 14:49.054
[tense music playing]

14:49.138 --> 14:53.559
[steam hissing]

14:53.642 --> 14:55.394
[firefighter] Come on!

15:01.108 --> 15:05.738
[sirens wailing]

15:07.323 --> 15:10.492
[Ann] From what I can see,
the fire is not out just yet.

15:10.576 --> 15:14.163
There is no roof left over two sections
of that part of the building.

15:16.373 --> 15:18.042
You can see the smoke behind me.

15:18.125 --> 15:21.378
You can actually see the smoke
from miles away.

15:24.048 --> 15:26.884
Three firefighters
have also been taken to Hurley.

15:26.967 --> 15:29.219
I've been told
that's just for observation.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.221
1805...

15:32.306 --> 15:35.851
Flint Fire tells me two people
who live here were taken to the hospital.

15:35.935 --> 15:39.980
They were rescued from their
third-floor balcony. They had to jump out.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.857
[woman sobbing]

15:41.941 --> 15:44.151
[officer] It's fine. It will be OK.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.112
These people are gonna
help you out, alright?

15:48.113 --> 15:49.531
What's most important?

15:52.743 --> 15:56.038
Just thank God that you didn't get hurt.
You're alive.

15:56.121 --> 15:58.207
Everything else can be replaced.

15:58.290 --> 16:00.918
[Ann] We'll hear more
from those residents, coming up.

16:01.001 --> 16:04.505
Live in Flint, I'm Ann Pierret,
ABC12 News.

16:09.468 --> 16:13.222
It's alright.
It's 3:56, so we're doing OK.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.103
[phone ringing]

16:19.186 --> 16:20.020
[woman] <i>Hello?</i>

16:20.104 --> 16:23.065
-Yeah, what's up?
-[woman] <i>Oh, nothing.</i>

16:23.148 --> 16:24.775
-Did you vote?
-[woman] <i>I'm on my way in.</i>

16:24.858 --> 16:27.152
<i>I stopped and got a coffee on my way in.</i>

16:27.486 --> 16:30.030
-I said, did you vote?
-[woman] <i>Yeah, I did.</i>

16:30.447 --> 16:31.573
Did you vote for Trump?

16:31.657 --> 16:34.910
[woman laughs over phone]

16:34.994 --> 16:37.538
You want to be groped by Trump, don't you?

16:37.621 --> 16:40.666
[woman] <i>I want to be groped</i>
<i>by Officer Willingham.</i>

16:43.419 --> 16:44.378
[Brian] OK!

16:44.461 --> 16:46.338
-[woman] <i>Have a good day.</i>
-[Brian] You too.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.799
-[woman] <i>I'll catch up with you later.</i>
-[Brian] Alright.

16:48.882 --> 16:50.259
-[woman] <i>Bye-bye.</i>
-[Brian] Bye.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.346
[Brian] Oh, man, Hillary is...

16:57.224 --> 17:01.186
I mean, some people been losing sleep
about this woman being president.

17:01.812 --> 17:06.483
And the only response that they've had
to it has been Donald Trump.

17:09.278 --> 17:13.031
I think the whole political thing
is a smokescreen

17:13.115 --> 17:16.160
from this kind of thing
that we really need to deal with. I've seen it even with Obama, in my mind.

17:23.375 --> 17:26.920
We make these symbolic progresses...

17:27.003 --> 17:29.757
You know, the first black president,

17:29.840 --> 17:32.092
and probably now
the first woman president.

17:33.010 --> 17:37.473
But no matter if we get a black man
or a white female or whoever in there,

17:38.223 --> 17:39.725
will our system...

17:41.852 --> 17:45.647
change to a level that it would
address this kind of problem?

17:45.731 --> 17:49.318
And I don't think it will.
I don't think it's designed to.

17:55.157 --> 17:58.494
[Brian] <i>We're not talking about</i>
<i>policing in Mayberry.</i>

17:58.994 --> 18:00.370
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

18:00.454 --> 18:04.249
<i>We're talking about policing</i>
<i>in an urban America.</i>

18:12.716 --> 18:15.427
[Brian] <i>This water crisis, this crack,</i>

18:15.511 --> 18:18.555
<i>these guns, these poor people</i>
<i>who don't go to school,</i>

18:18.639 --> 18:20.224
<i>these abandoned homes</i>

18:20.307 --> 18:23.185
<i>and broken-down neighborhoods</i>
<i>and all of that...</i>

18:23.268 --> 18:26.438
Affluent society expects the cops

18:26.522 --> 18:31.401
to keep that world separate
from their world.

18:35.114 --> 18:38.700
<i>Basically, now what we're talking about</i>
<i>is two different Americas out here.</i>

18:42.037 --> 18:45.040
[Brian] <i>As cops, we all pretty much spend</i>
<i>the first four or five years</i>

18:45.124 --> 18:48.335
<i>doing the same thing -</i>
<i>learning how to be the police.</i>

18:50.003 --> 18:52.548
<i>Then, like I said, it becomes a matter</i>

18:52.631 --> 18:56.051
<i>of how the reality of it sets in for you.</i>

18:59.805 --> 19:03.433
<i>Am I gonna go through here</i>
<i>and tow 20 different families' cars?</i>

19:03.517 --> 19:05.477
<i>Because I can do it.</i>

19:07.146 --> 19:10.858
What's really gonna be the outcome of it?

19:10.941 --> 19:13.819
How am I bettering the community

19:14.862 --> 19:18.073
by taking everybody's car
that's not legit?

19:18.532 --> 19:22.452
Or writing a person
who already has multiple warrants

19:23.078 --> 19:25.372
more tickets that they can't pay?

19:27.124 --> 19:29.376
The decisions you make as a cop

19:29.459 --> 19:34.089
have a ripple effect
on the real lives of people.

19:34.882 --> 19:39.595
[somber ambient music playing]

19:47.186 --> 19:49.396
So, I wonder what this guy is thinking

19:49.479 --> 19:51.899
when he is going the wrong way
on a one-way

19:51.982 --> 19:53.817
and the police are sitting right here.

19:54.985 --> 19:59.573
Go ahead, because I'm gonna pull you over,
and, well, we're gonna talk.

20:00.115 --> 20:01.658
We'll chat.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.373
This is gonna be brief. Hang on.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.751
-Driver's license?
-[woman] I was on my way home.

20:10.834 --> 20:13.212
-[Devon] Roll the window down.
-[woman] It won't go down.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.339
-[Devon] It doesn't?
-[woman] I apologize, sir.

20:15.422 --> 20:17.216
-Where is your license?
-[woman] At home.

20:17.299 --> 20:19.301
Do you have anything with your name on it?

20:20.552 --> 20:23.597
[woman] Sir, I am on my way home.
I'm not going nowhere else.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.891
-You have nothing with your name on it?
-[woman] No.

20:25.974 --> 20:28.560
-Where's home, hon?
-[woman] Right here on Allendale.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.312
-[Devon] OK.
-[woman] I apologize.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.564
-Is your driver's license valid?
-[woman] Yes.

20:33.732 --> 20:36.026
-Whose car have you got tonight?
-[woman] This is mine.

20:36.109 --> 20:38.028
-Is it registered to you?
-[woman] Yes, sir.

20:38.111 --> 20:39.863
-What's your name?
-Shardana Anderson.

20:39.947 --> 20:43.158
-[Devon] How do you spell it?
-No, it's not registered to me. I'm sorry.

20:43.242 --> 20:48.538
It's S, H, A, R, D, A, N, A...

20:48.622 --> 20:49.957
Anderson.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.292
-[Devon] S, H, A, R, D, A...
-[woman] Anderson.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.294
-[Devon] Anderson?
-[woman] I apologize.

20:54.378 --> 20:56.880
-[Devon] What's your middle name?
-[woman] R.

20:56.964 --> 21:00.425
-[Devon] It's just "R"?
-[woman] Yeah. No. You said it's just "R"?

21:00.509 --> 21:03.428
[woman] I'm sorry, my name is Jaquasha.
I'm sorry. I'm so nervous.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.597
My name is Jaquasha Anderson.
I apologize.

21:05.681 --> 21:08.392
[Devon] Then why tell me
your name is Shardana Anderson?

21:08.475 --> 21:10.269
[woman] I don't have my license on me.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.812
Come here.

21:12.479 --> 21:13.981
-I'm nervous.
-Step back here.

21:15.941 --> 21:19.695
We are going to start this over, because
this was a really easy traffic stop.

21:19.778 --> 21:21.697
OK. I apologize.

21:21.780 --> 21:24.741
[Devon] What is your name?
Don't put your hand in your pocket.

21:24.825 --> 21:27.286
-[Devon] Do you have any ID?
-[woman] Yes, I do.

21:27.369 --> 21:31.123
-[Devon] Is it in this pocket here? OK.
-[woman] This one right here.

21:31.206 --> 21:32.749
-[Devon] OK, get that.
-[woman] OK.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.752
Two hundred.
I'm on a traffic stop. I'm all set.

21:36.753 --> 21:40.382
So, explain why you would tell me
your name is Shardana Anderson.

21:40.465 --> 21:43.051
-Because, I don't know, I was nervous.
-[Devon] About what?

21:43.135 --> 21:44.344
I don't know, sir.

21:44.428 --> 21:48.640
-[Devon] Do you have any warrants?
-No. Not that I know of, sir.

21:48.724 --> 21:51.643
-[Devon] Anything on you or in the car?
-No, sir.

21:51.727 --> 21:54.730
OK. Do me a favor.
Have a seat right here on the curb.

21:57.065 --> 22:00.902
I'm gonna run you through the computers
and I'll take a look through the car.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.363
OK? And then we will work
through the rest.

22:03.447 --> 22:06.199
It just concerns me
that you gave me a different name.

22:06.283 --> 22:08.285
-[woman] I'm sorry.
-Alright.

22:16.293 --> 22:17.169
[Devon] <i>OK.</i>

22:17.252 --> 22:20.505
I have no idea
why your first move would be

22:20.589 --> 22:22.424
to lie to me about what your name is.

22:22.507 --> 22:25.010
[woman] I just graduated from college
for criminal justice

22:25.093 --> 22:27.429
and that is not something
I'm supposed to do.

22:27.846 --> 22:30.057
With or without a degree
in criminal justice,

22:30.140 --> 22:33.852
you're not supposed to lie to police,
especially when there's no reason.

22:33.935 --> 22:36.605
You've got nothing in your car.
Your license is valid.

22:36.688 --> 22:38.398
The car's registered to you.

22:38.982 --> 22:42.027
And you lie to me because you're going
the wrong way on a one-way.

22:42.110 --> 22:45.405
-[woman] I will never do that again.
-Well, I would hope not.

22:46.573 --> 22:49.117
-[Devon] See, it wasn't that hard, was it?
-[woman] No.

22:56.958 --> 23:00.629
[Devon] It might be
that the, you know, relationship

23:00.712 --> 23:04.674
that either she personally has,
or her neighborhood has,

23:04.758 --> 23:07.803
or her family has or, or whatever,

23:08.428 --> 23:11.765
somehow led her to the point

23:11.848 --> 23:14.643
where she feels
like she can't trust the police.

23:17.562 --> 23:20.982
And to find out
that she had no reason to lie

23:21.066 --> 23:23.902
other than she drove the wrong way
on a one-way.

23:23.985 --> 23:28.323
And she didn't know it, but I am
the last guy to give her a traffic ticket.

23:33.995 --> 23:36.498
[Devon] There's some premium stuff
for you.

23:37.374 --> 23:41.002
The message is unclear.
People have pondered this for a while.

23:41.086 --> 23:43.088
I think it's actually a message of love,

23:44.172 --> 23:46.466
where they're suggesting that...

23:47.300 --> 23:51.054
the community should make
sweet, sweet love to law enforcement...

23:52.973 --> 23:55.851
as a reward
for all their hard work and efforts,

23:56.726 --> 23:58.895
putting their lives on the line every day.

24:02.816 --> 24:05.152
[Jazmin] She got that picture,
legs wide open.

24:05.235 --> 24:07.779
It's a girl.
There was no ding-a-ling there.

24:07.863 --> 24:12.117
I had just seen a white-colored line.
So I was, like, "That must be his thing."

24:12.200 --> 24:13.618
And she's like, "It's a girl."

24:13.702 --> 24:17.414
I knew when she said, "There's your baby."
I'm like, "It's a girl."

24:18.498 --> 24:20.792
Dude, starting pay: ten dollars an hour.

24:21.459 --> 24:22.711
Plus bonuses,

24:22.794 --> 24:25.005
and you get free employee meals and tips.

24:25.547 --> 24:28.508
I would get fat working here.
I would eat every day.

24:28.592 --> 24:29.593
Hey!

24:31.970 --> 24:34.598
[Jazmin] I like Noelle, Noella...

24:36.308 --> 24:37.642
Alana...

24:39.519 --> 24:42.480
-I mean, if you like it, I guess...
-[Jazmin] No, I want you to like it.

24:42.898 --> 24:44.900
We'll find something that we agree on.

24:49.446 --> 24:50.947
What about...

24:53.074 --> 24:54.367
LeBron?

24:55.410 --> 24:56.828
[Jazmin] What about Kobe?

25:04.252 --> 25:06.421
-[barber] You aren't too far off.
-[Tim] Yeah.

25:06.504 --> 25:08.256
[Barber] You're acting like a young chick!

25:08.340 --> 25:11.551
-[barber] A little, young chicken!
-Yeah.

25:15.138 --> 25:19.893
[Tim] <i>I know that the citizens was not</i>
<i>told the truth in the last administration.</i>

25:20.644 --> 25:22.854
<i>They were lied to, OK?</i>

25:23.521 --> 25:26.816
<i>We don't know what happened to the money.</i>
<i>We don't know what they did.</i>

25:28.151 --> 25:30.737
<i>It sure didn't reach</i>
<i>the Flint Police Department.</i>

25:32.864 --> 25:36.076
<i>With that in mind,</i>
<i>we're asking for your support this time,</i>

25:36.159 --> 25:40.163
<i>and you can rest assured, the money</i>
<i>is gonna go where we say it's gonna go.</i>

25:40.497 --> 25:42.249
If this millage doesn't pass,

25:42.332 --> 25:44.751
it's gonna come
to a screeching halt, almost,

25:44.834 --> 25:47.963
and everything that we've worked for
thus far,

25:48.046 --> 25:50.548
is gonna pretty much go back
the way it was.

25:50.632 --> 25:52.050
Talking to the average voter...

25:52.133 --> 25:55.220
We're trying to provide the best service
for the citizens in this city

25:55.303 --> 25:59.015
with the resources that we're provided,
and those resources are very slim.

25:59.099 --> 26:01.184
Everybody's wearing three and four hats,

26:01.268 --> 26:03.478
and they're pulled
from one end to the other.

26:03.561 --> 26:05.772
Literally, we cannot afford to lose one.

26:09.651 --> 26:12.821
[engine starts up]

26:14.531 --> 26:15.573
[officer] Let's go.

26:16.533 --> 26:19.327
He said you're safe until tomorrow.

26:19.411 --> 26:20.704
[Esther] Is that what he said?

26:22.289 --> 26:26.209
[ambient music playing]

26:35.343 --> 26:37.470
[Esther] Alright, 30 seconds. [officer] We're gonna get
them motherfuckers!

26:43.184 --> 26:45.020
[officers speaking indistinctly]

26:58.825 --> 27:00.410
[officer] Police! Search warrant!

28:16.486 --> 28:19.239
and in that time, I've been laid off
a total of three times.

28:19.322 --> 28:21.366
I was laid off for a total of three years.

28:21.449 --> 28:23.243

[Kevin] Are we expecting
any more people coming or buying tonight?

28:52.605 --> 28:55.900
Should we sell to them or should we
just tell them the police are here?

28:57.152 --> 29:01.072
I think it's impossible to attract
a good city of Flint police officer today,

29:01.156 --> 29:02.824
for $15 an hour,

29:02.907 --> 29:07.287
when I could go work ten miles away
and make double the money.

29:07.370 --> 29:10.206
I work my tail off every day,

29:11.040 --> 29:16.129
and now that I just cashed that check
from working security on the side,

29:16.212 --> 29:18.715
I got $120 bucks in my pocket, you know?

29:18.798 --> 29:22.010
And if it weren't for that,
I had a dollar in my pocket.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.349
[Kevin] Oh, shit.

29:32.479 --> 29:35.690
Clerks across the county are reporting
a far bigger turnout

29:35.774 --> 29:39.068

29:50.330 --> 29:51.706
This is miserable.

29:52.916 --> 29:54.584
[cameraman] It could get worse.

29:55.668 --> 29:58.379
More voters could sway decisions
down the ballot, too,

29:58.463 --> 30:00.298
like the Flint police millage.

30:00.381 --> 30:03.176
And do we have an idea
how the turnout is locally, Ann?

30:03.468 --> 30:07.430
We don't have any concrete numbers yet,
but the Genesee County clerk tells me

30:07.514 --> 30:11.392
they are seeing a lot larger number
of people here at the polls.

30:11.476 --> 30:15.480

<i>his speeches,</i>
<i>an officer-involved shooting,</i>

41:10.968 --> 41:15.181
<i>and he's personally calling family members</i>
<i>of the officers that are killed.</i>

41:17.016 --> 41:20.436
And I saw a very negative trend
with the Democratic Party.

41:20.519 --> 41:22.813
Let's end the epidemic

41:22.897 --> 41:27.651
of African Americans being killed
by police or dying in custody.

41:27.735 --> 41:32.072
Fuck, even if Hillary said,
"I hate police," right,

41:32.448 --> 41:35.784
still, you fucking put her up
in comparison with Donald Trump...

41:35.868 --> 41:38.496
Please don't be too nice.

41:39.330 --> 41:43.167
Like when you guys put somebody in the car
and you're protecting their head...

41:43.250 --> 41:45.377
You know, the way you put the hand on...

41:46.545 --> 41:50.549
Like, don't hit their head,
and they've just killed somebody...

41:50.633 --> 41:53.010
I said, you can take the hand away, OK?

41:53.761 --> 41:56.055
[cheering]

41:56.138 --> 41:58.098
[audience applauding]

42:00.601 --> 42:03.395
Who knows? Maybe personally,
he is a big asshole.

42:03.729 --> 42:05.397
Maybe he is racist. I don't know.

42:05.773 --> 42:10.611
But for me, personally,
it had to do with what I do for a living.

42:11.362 --> 42:13.113
What about everybody else?

42:13.197 --> 42:14.949
It had a direct effect on me.

42:16.909 --> 42:19.328
You know, sometimes
it just can't be about you.

42:31.590 --> 42:33.634
-[woman] You're here early.
-[woman #2] Yeah.

42:39.390 --> 42:41.642
Just looking back over the last four weeks

42:41.725 --> 42:44.019
and what we went through
with this millage,

42:44.103 --> 42:45.396
it's just unbelievable.

42:45.479 --> 42:49.233
I've seen lieutenants and captains,
and I've seen officers out on the street

42:49.316 --> 42:53.028
going door to door,
handing out literature, and it worked.

42:53.529 --> 42:57.825
So I was a little concerned
whether or not it was gonna pass or not,

42:57.908 --> 43:00.327
but getting out there,
talking to the citizens

43:00.411 --> 43:02.788
and showing them
that it meant that much to us,

43:02.871 --> 43:05.499
they really came out
and supported this department.

43:06.125 --> 43:09.003
I need to say a prayer.
Let's bow our heads for a minute.

43:09.545 --> 43:12.631
Father, we come to you in prayer.
Thank you for another day.

43:12.715 --> 43:14.675
Thank you for your grace and your mercy.

43:14.758 --> 43:16.969
Thank you for your direction
and leadership.

43:17.052 --> 43:19.638
We ask that you continue to guide
and direct our path,

43:21.181 --> 43:23.267
continue to give us victory
over these crimes

43:23.350 --> 43:25.144
that are happening in this city...

43:28.397 --> 43:30.649
continue to keep our officers safe...

43:32.651 --> 43:34.612
and we'll give you
all the praise and the glory.

43:34.695 --> 43:40.326
[melancholy music playing]

43:49.960 --> 43:55.424
[music continues playing]

44:21.325 --> 44:23.327
[music fades]
