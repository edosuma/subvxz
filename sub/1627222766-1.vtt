02:26.256 --> 02:27.755
Woo!

02:27.755 --> 02:29.262
Oh, yeah, here we go.

02:29.262 --> 02:31.371
And I'm feeling right.

02:31.371 --> 02:33.302
Oh, yeah, getting close.

02:33.302 --> 02:34.512
Oh, here it is.

02:34.512 --> 02:35.731
Ready?

02:35.731 --> 02:36.672
Ready?

02:36.672 --> 02:39.491
(Andrew grunting)

02:39.491 --> 02:44.186
Fire in the hole.
(Andrew moaning)

02:44.186 --> 02:46.936
(Andrew sighing)

02:50.101 --> 02:52.184
- I love you.
- Oh, yeah.

02:55.031 --> 02:57.781
(Andrew sighing)

03:00.710 --> 03:02.953
That made this whole work week worth it.

03:05.320 --> 03:07.070
- Glad you enjoyed it.

03:07.070 --> 03:09.170
- What, you didn't get anything from that?

03:11.171 --> 03:12.004
What, nothing at all?

03:14.631 --> 03:16.493
All right, well, what
would you have liked?

03:19.490 --> 03:21.860
- I would like to feel
that we are connecting.

03:21.860 --> 03:22.770
- Seriously?

03:22.770 --> 03:24.313
You didn't feel that?

03:26.851 --> 03:28.490
(Andrew scoffs)

03:28.490 --> 03:30.540
All right, what did I do wrong this time?

03:31.510 --> 03:34.750
- You seem to be turning
this into a competition.

03:34.750 --> 03:38.210
I'm not a goal.
(Andrew chuckling)

03:38.210 --> 03:40.270
See, you don't care how I feel.

03:40.270 --> 03:41.870
It's always about you.

03:41.870 --> 03:42.703
- Oh, come on.

03:42.703 --> 03:43.920
You know I have a sense of humor.

03:43.920 --> 03:46.095
I was just thinking about something funny.

03:46.095 --> 03:46.928
(Chloe scoffs)

03:46.928 --> 03:48.190
- You think this is funny?

03:49.874 --> 03:52.703
- I thought you liked it whenever
I took you to pound town?

03:56.079 --> 03:57.813
Baby, I was joking.

04:00.535 --> 04:02.572
I'm not dealing with this shit.

04:02.572 --> 04:05.155
(somber music)

04:12.510 --> 04:13.573
Fuck this.

04:25.320 --> 04:27.560
- So, what, you're gonna go hang out

04:27.560 --> 04:30.650
with your buddies instead
of dealing with this?

04:30.650 --> 04:31.483
- Nope.

04:37.596 --> 04:39.500
- Then what are you doing?

04:39.500 --> 04:40.943
- Avoiding this mess.

04:44.220 --> 04:45.320
- What does that mean?

04:49.409 --> 04:51.068
- I want a divorce.

04:51.068 --> 04:54.485
(somber music continues)

05:00.737 --> 05:03.404
(door slamming)

05:14.195 --> 05:15.610
Come on, I'm not a total dick.

05:15.610 --> 05:17.360
I let you keep the house, didn't I?

05:20.000 --> 05:22.203
How many times do you
have to read the thing?

05:24.120 --> 05:26.586
- Just like that, it's over?

05:26.586 --> 05:29.110
- No, you still haven't signed it.

05:29.110 --> 05:31.260
Come on, I got a new girl now.

05:31.260 --> 05:35.725
She's younger, better looking,
does what I want her to,

05:35.725 --> 05:38.197
and complains a whole lot
less than you ever did.

05:44.716 --> 05:46.299
Quick and painless.

05:52.870 --> 05:53.913
- You're an asshole.

05:55.750 --> 05:57.000
- I know.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.373
I'm a free asshole.

05:59.420 --> 06:00.310
Enjoy your life.

06:02.017 --> 06:03.796
(door slamming)

06:03.796 --> 06:06.379
(somber music)

06:09.876 --> 06:12.459
(Chloe crying)

06:29.042 --> 06:31.542
(Chloe sighs)

06:42.330 --> 06:44.997
(phone ringing)

06:55.341 --> 06:56.174
(fist knocking)

06:56.174 --> 06:58.861
- I know you're in here.

06:58.861 --> 07:01.028
I heard the phone ringing.

07:01.940 --> 07:04.273
Or I can just let myself in.

07:07.418 --> 07:11.907
What is this?
(door slamming)

07:11.907 --> 07:15.180
Are we enjoying a self-pity party?

07:15.180 --> 07:16.530
- I need to be alone.

07:16.530 --> 07:18.160
- Oh, yeah, because that works.

07:18.160 --> 07:19.760
It's been a month and honestly,

07:19.760 --> 07:22.030
you look like you're on your
way to alcohol poisoning.

07:22.030 --> 07:22.863
Spill it.

07:24.560 --> 07:25.393
- It's over.

07:27.810 --> 07:28.780
- What?

07:28.780 --> 07:30.400
Your hopes, your dreams, world hunger?

07:30.400 --> 07:31.233
What's over?

07:32.140 --> 07:32.973
- Andrew and I.

07:32.973 --> 07:36.330
- Oh, God, babe, that was over months ago.

07:36.330 --> 07:38.840
- What I need right now
is a "I told you so."

07:38.840 --> 07:41.790
- Oh, yeah, well I mean when
you're right, you're right.

07:41.790 --> 07:45.470
And you staying in and getting
drunk isn't really helping.

07:45.470 --> 07:47.600
We need to get drunk properly.

07:47.600 --> 07:48.928
Come on, we have to get you up.

07:48.928 --> 07:49.943
- What?
- And cleaned up, yes, yes.

07:49.943 --> 07:51.409
- Oh, no.
- You're coming with me.

07:51.409 --> 07:52.550
We are going out.
- Oh, come on.

07:52.550 --> 07:54.717
- You're getting dressed now.

07:54.717 --> 07:56.808
- I don't want to.
(Sam singing)

07:56.808 --> 07:57.920
- We're gonna have fun.

07:57.920 --> 07:58.920
Get dressed.

07:58.920 --> 08:01.130
Take a bath, do it.

08:01.130 --> 08:02.620
We're going out.

08:02.620 --> 08:04.610
Hey, sweets.
- Hi, Mom.

08:04.610 --> 08:06.416
The delivery guy just dropped this off.

08:06.416 --> 08:08.993
(Sam gasps)
- Perfect, just in time.

08:09.930 --> 08:11.380
- I had to forge your signature again.

08:11.380 --> 08:12.826
- Again?

08:12.826 --> 08:13.840
(Angela giggling)

08:13.840 --> 08:15.620
- Yeah, well, I'm gonna go to the mall.

08:15.620 --> 08:16.453
- Okay.

08:16.453 --> 08:17.970
All right, be home by nine o'clock.

08:17.970 --> 08:19.750
- Why, it's not like you'll be.

08:19.750 --> 08:23.180
- Oh, young lady, you do
as I say, not as I do.

08:23.180 --> 08:24.510
Come here, give me a kiss.

08:24.510 --> 08:26.066
Oh.
(lips smacking)

08:26.066 --> 08:27.580
(both giggling)

08:27.580 --> 08:29.790
Go, and nine o'clock!

08:29.790 --> 08:32.972
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, I'm serious.

08:32.972 --> 08:34.049
It's heavy.

08:34.049 --> 08:35.023
This is awesome.

08:45.263 --> 08:46.700
Woo hoo!
(Chloe groaning)

08:46.700 --> 08:48.360
- What the hell?

08:48.360 --> 08:50.080
Sam, what is this?

08:50.080 --> 08:51.773
- I wanna fuck you.

08:52.840 --> 08:54.683
This is your new lover.

08:55.550 --> 08:56.470
- A teddy bear?

08:56.470 --> 08:58.800
- Well, you're either gonna
make Andrew really angry

08:58.800 --> 09:01.690
with another man or you're
just gonna fuck up your life

09:01.690 --> 09:04.810
with a trail of new losers,
so I figured I'd bring you

09:04.810 --> 09:07.373
something that would make you smile.

09:09.193 --> 09:10.595
And you know what is name is?

09:10.595 --> 09:11.526
(Sam gasps)

09:11.526 --> 09:13.076
It's Bearry.

09:13.076 --> 09:14.560
Oh, oh, oh, wait.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.540
- [Bearry] I love you bearry much.

09:16.540 --> 09:19.743
- Oh, so cute.

09:23.680 --> 09:25.400
All right, are you hungry?

09:25.400 --> 09:26.870
- Yeah.

09:26.870 --> 09:28.600
Yeah, let's get outta here.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.283
- [Sam] Oh, I need a drink.

09:31.430 --> 09:32.347
Okay, whew!

09:38.714 --> 09:41.214
(Chloe sighs)

09:45.201 --> 09:48.451
(light romantic music)

09:55.190 --> 09:56.140
- Here you go.

09:56.140 --> 09:58.040
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

09:58.040 --> 09:58.874
- Um.
- Oh.

10:04.510 --> 10:05.950
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

10:07.040 --> 10:11.020
Stephen, your girlfriend is at table 16.

10:11.020 --> 10:11.853
- Stop it.

10:15.249 --> 10:17.916
(Stephen sighs)

10:19.605 --> 10:21.057
Here you are.
- Oh.

10:21.057 --> 10:23.130
- Is there anything else I can get you?

10:23.130 --> 10:24.573
- No, thank you.

10:27.094 --> 10:30.300
- Hm, he's cute for an older guy.

10:31.210 --> 10:34.670
- Can I just enjoy my meal, please?

10:34.670 --> 10:36.950
- You can try.
(Chloe scoffs)

10:36.950 --> 10:38.890
Oh, this kid.

10:38.890 --> 10:39.723
- Hey, Mom.

10:39.723 --> 10:43.700
So, I think I left my purse
in the trunk of your car

10:43.700 --> 10:46.373
or in the locker at the gym,
in which case I might have to

10:46.373 --> 10:47.790
replace your credit card.

10:47.790 --> 10:50.430
So, I'm really hoping it's
in the trunk of your car.

10:50.430 --> 10:51.560
- What?

10:51.560 --> 10:53.540
You'd forget your head
if it wasn't attached.

10:53.540 --> 10:56.040
Did you at least remember
to lock the front door?

10:56.040 --> 10:58.073
- Yes, Mom, I'm not an idiot.

11:04.180 --> 11:05.596
- I'll be back.

11:05.596 --> 11:08.846
(light romantic music)

11:12.180 --> 11:13.230
- Is everything okay?

11:14.534 --> 11:16.040
(Chloe chuckling)

11:16.040 --> 11:17.290
Good.

11:17.290 --> 11:19.880
You need anything else, just let me know.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.800
- No, I'm good.

11:22.800 --> 11:23.800
- I'm just checking.

11:27.980 --> 11:28.813
Enjoy.

11:33.732 --> 11:34.720
- Are you done yet?

11:34.720 --> 11:36.653
We need to get you white girl drunk.

11:43.280 --> 11:45.780
(Sam gulping)

11:52.930 --> 11:53.763
Let's go.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.583
- Sam, you forgot these.

12:00.710 --> 12:02.365
- Thanks for coming.

12:02.365 --> 12:04.948
(upbeat music)

12:23.693 --> 12:25.026
- Anything else?

12:36.662 --> 12:38.698
Okay, ladies, here's your tab.

12:38.698 --> 12:40.865
I think you've had enough.

12:42.211 --> 12:44.961
(Chloe groaning)

12:47.983 --> 12:50.653
- What am I going to do with you?

12:52.642 --> 12:55.475
(Chloe chuckling)

12:58.053 --> 13:00.393
I guess I'll be snuggling
with you tonight.

13:02.140 --> 13:04.167
- [Bearry] I love you bearry much.

13:04.167 --> 13:05.702
- Aw.

13:05.702 --> 13:06.535
Mm.

13:08.498 --> 13:11.081
(upbeat music)

13:31.334 --> 13:33.159
(Chloe sighs)

13:33.159 --> 13:36.186
Cute, but I'm not in the mood.

13:36.186 --> 13:37.769
You sure are needy.

13:39.660 --> 13:40.943
Crap, what time is it?

13:42.365 --> 13:43.314
Oh, God.

13:43.314 --> 13:44.182
I'm late.

13:44.182 --> 13:45.973
I can't believe I let Sam set me up.

13:52.184 --> 13:53.017
(light romantic music)

13:53.017 --> 13:55.360
- Let me tell you a
little bit about myself.

13:55.360 --> 13:58.650
I enjoy a rousing fencing tournament,

13:58.650 --> 14:00.840
I am well versed in Shakespeare,

14:00.840 --> 14:04.290
and I enjoy occasionally the odd cricket,

14:04.290 --> 14:07.030
or the delightful fox hunt.

14:07.030 --> 14:08.840
Now, tell me a little bit about yourself.

14:08.840 --> 14:11.490
You're vegan, am I
understanding that correctly?

14:11.490 --> 14:14.270
Or is it that raw thing?

14:14.270 --> 14:15.103
I don't know.

14:15.103 --> 14:16.390
I enjoy haggis myself.

14:16.390 --> 14:17.223
Oh, my goodness.

14:17.223 --> 14:18.332
Have you ever had haggis?

14:18.332 --> 14:19.270
Oh!

14:19.270 --> 14:20.250
- No, you got it wrong.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.200
I'm not looking for a girlfriend.

14:22.200 --> 14:25.620
I'm looking for girlfriends.
(Chloe scoffs)

14:25.620 --> 14:27.780
- How old are you?
- Oh, I'm 18.

14:29.517 --> 14:31.015
I'm legal.

14:31.015 --> 14:32.265
I'm into MILFs.

14:46.480 --> 14:47.313
- Wow.

14:49.657 --> 14:50.824
You're pretty.

15:01.625 --> 15:03.197
- Woo wee!

15:03.197 --> 15:05.250
You're prettier than Betsy.

15:05.250 --> 15:06.083
- Who's Betsy?

15:07.204 --> 15:09.190
- That's my prize winning heifer.

15:09.190 --> 15:10.573
- Move along.

15:11.690 --> 15:14.773
(video game beeping)

15:19.853 --> 15:22.853
(Stephen chuckling)

15:27.460 --> 15:28.293
- Yes!

15:34.830 --> 15:36.047
Bitch.

15:36.047 --> 15:36.880
(Chloe laughing)

15:36.880 --> 15:38.070
- I can't believe it.

15:38.070 --> 15:40.490
I might be getting that promotion.

15:40.490 --> 15:42.440
Yes, I'm going to dinner with my boss.

15:42.440 --> 15:43.763
No, it's not a date.

15:44.790 --> 15:46.960
Sam, why do you have to
crap on every good thing

15:46.960 --> 15:47.973
that happens to me?

15:49.145 --> 15:50.950
(Chloe scoffs)

15:50.950 --> 15:53.100
Yes, he just got out of a marriage.

15:53.100 --> 15:54.260
How long?

15:54.260 --> 15:55.583
I don't know, who cares.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.360
No, it's just business.

16:00.360 --> 16:03.270
Besides if it wasn't, he'd
be better than any of those

16:03.270 --> 16:05.920
losers you tried setting me up with.

16:05.920 --> 16:06.870
They were horrible.

16:09.530 --> 16:11.000
Sam, come on.

16:11.000 --> 16:11.833
Whatever.

16:13.164 --> 16:14.240
Mm hm.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.613
Oh, come on.

16:17.670 --> 16:20.430
Be happy I'm getting this promotion.

16:20.430 --> 16:24.263
I earned it and not the way you do.

16:24.263 --> 16:26.287
(Chloe giggling)

16:26.287 --> 16:29.070
(Chloe sighing)

16:29.070 --> 16:31.180
You support me, don't you, Bearry?

16:33.811 --> 16:36.023
(light music)

16:36.023 --> 16:37.030
(hand slapping)
(Kelly scoffs)

16:37.030 --> 16:37.863
- Tasty.

16:41.450 --> 16:43.840
- Hi.
- Yeah.

16:43.840 --> 16:44.740
- Good to see you.

16:45.850 --> 16:47.100
- It's better to see you.

16:48.540 --> 16:50.480
- Thanks for considering me.

16:50.480 --> 16:54.550
I figured dinner first, then
we can discuss the position?

16:54.550 --> 16:57.350
- I'm sure there are plenty
of positions you're good at.

16:58.370 --> 17:00.060
I don't think we'll have
a problem finding one.

17:00.060 --> 17:01.610
- I really want this promotion.

17:03.340 --> 17:04.973
- Well, let's see if you earn it.

17:11.700 --> 17:13.973
Yeah, that's fucked up.

17:16.630 --> 17:17.936
- I really know how to pick 'em.

17:18.804 --> 17:20.093
- Well, it seems like you
had a lot on your chest

17:20.093 --> 17:22.271
you had to get off of.

17:22.271 --> 17:23.320
Why don't we do this?

17:24.380 --> 17:28.400
Go back to your place, get some drinks,

17:28.400 --> 17:31.410
and I'll help you forget
all about that guy.

17:31.410 --> 17:33.713
You know, earn your promotion.

17:35.470 --> 17:36.333
- Excuse me?

17:37.460 --> 17:40.480
- Look, lady, if I didn't
earn any trim listening

17:40.480 --> 17:43.760
to that crap, tell me
what do I have to do?

17:43.760 --> 17:45.793
- You just wanted to sleep with me?

17:47.290 --> 17:48.373
You're a pig!

17:49.760 --> 17:52.043
- So, is that a no?

17:54.250 --> 17:56.828
Look, first you bring
me to this shit hole,

17:56.828 --> 17:58.280
then you dump this crap of a story on me,

17:58.280 --> 18:00.920
and you're telling me I
don't get anything out of it?

18:00.920 --> 18:02.640
- Get out of here!

18:02.640 --> 18:04.200
- Excuse me?

18:04.200 --> 18:05.100
- Get out of here!

18:06.220 --> 18:07.490
- Is there a problem?

18:07.490 --> 18:08.323
- Yes!

18:09.560 --> 18:10.593
- You need to leave.

18:11.483 --> 18:14.183
- Oh, well, this place turned
out to be a bust anyway.

18:15.180 --> 18:16.070
Looks like I have to find somebody else

18:16.070 --> 18:18.020
that's more qualified for the position.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.510
Better yet, why don't you take a vacation?

18:23.510 --> 18:24.883
Unpaid, of course.

18:27.500 --> 18:28.333
Fuck you.

18:29.602 --> 18:31.483
- Hit the road, bitch!

18:34.030 --> 18:35.680
Okay, looks like my shift's over.

18:37.677 --> 18:40.177
(light music)

18:49.624 --> 18:51.380
- Are you okay?

18:51.380 --> 18:53.221
- What's wrong with me?

18:53.221 --> 18:55.513
- I don't think there's
anything wrong with you.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.853
- Why am I surrounded by losers?

19:04.607 --> 19:07.440
- Do you have anyone you can call?

19:08.700 --> 19:09.533
- Yeah.

19:10.490 --> 19:11.323
Thank you.

19:12.473 --> 19:14.630
- All right, I've got something
to finish up in the back,

19:14.630 --> 19:17.633
but I'll be close by if you need anything.

19:20.930 --> 19:25.398
(restaurant guests
talking over each other)

19:25.398 --> 19:29.390
(phone beeping)
(Chloe sighs)

19:29.390 --> 19:32.105
- [Sam] It's Sam, you know what to do.

19:32.105 --> 19:34.723
(voicemail beeping)
- Sam, call me back.

19:36.761 --> 19:39.428
(phone beeping)

19:40.534 --> 19:43.784
(light romantic music)

19:49.213 --> 19:52.546
(wine bottles clinking)

19:53.707 --> 19:55.520
(Chloe clears throat)

19:55.520 --> 19:56.353
Hi.

19:57.890 --> 19:59.710
I hate to ask, but would I be able

19:59.710 --> 20:01.060
to get a ride home tonight?

20:02.710 --> 20:04.040
I feel a bit uncomfortable calling

20:04.040 --> 20:05.590
a complete stranger for a ride.

20:07.940 --> 20:08.773
- Sure.

20:11.680 --> 20:13.430
Just let me finish up a few things.

20:16.140 --> 20:17.940
- Is there anything I can help with?

20:19.200 --> 20:20.983
- Yeah, grab a towel.

20:27.810 --> 20:30.977
You know, I'm sorry you lost your job.

20:38.260 --> 20:41.113
Hey, I can do this tomorrow.

20:42.740 --> 20:43.690
Let's get you home.

20:49.249 --> 20:54.249
(car engine rumbling)
(bugs chirping)

20:58.880 --> 20:59.713
We're here.

21:01.717 --> 21:03.593
It's a really nice place you got.

21:06.260 --> 21:07.310
- What am I gonna do?

21:09.414 --> 21:14.414
- Look, I can offer you a job
till you get on your feet.

21:15.100 --> 21:17.838
- Thank you, but I'm not a waitress.

21:17.838 --> 21:21.080
- No, not as a waitress, as a bar back.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.778
You were damn good tonight.

21:22.778 --> 21:24.262
(Chloe giggling)

21:24.262 --> 21:26.233
Hey, I got a laugh outta you.

21:26.233 --> 21:27.066
There's a start.

21:28.170 --> 21:31.383
If you need anything, I'm here to help.

21:34.039 --> 21:35.039
- Thank you.

21:44.034 --> 21:46.727
(car door slamming)

21:46.727 --> 21:49.977
(light dramatic music)

22:00.499 --> 22:03.082
You love me, don't you, Bearry?

22:04.943 --> 22:07.776
- [Bearry] I love you bearry much.

22:09.147 --> 22:10.480
- I know you do.

22:21.543 --> 22:23.655
I love you bearry much, too.

22:23.655 --> 22:26.738
(dramatic whooshing)

22:30.848 --> 22:33.348
(Chloe sighs)

22:36.640 --> 22:38.253
Why are all men creeps?

22:42.090 --> 22:44.650
That jackass made me lose my mind tonight.

22:48.163 --> 22:50.033
I wish he'd lose his.

23:04.240 --> 23:07.883
- Hey, you need to hire another woman.

23:09.820 --> 23:11.703
That bitch, Chloe, didn't work out.

23:13.850 --> 23:15.903
I took her for an interview for dinner.

23:16.980 --> 23:18.573
She was ungrateful, uptight.

23:20.920 --> 23:21.753
Excuse me?

23:23.740 --> 23:27.080
I got a position for any
woman in this goddamn office!

23:27.080 --> 23:28.163
I'm the boss!

23:30.370 --> 23:31.203
Exactly.

23:33.310 --> 23:35.783
Now you make sure the
next one has big tits.

23:38.346 --> 23:39.746
I need something to look at.

23:41.330 --> 23:43.793
I don't know, email me your top three.

23:44.870 --> 23:46.480
I don't have all night.

23:46.480 --> 23:49.580
It's been wasted.
(ominous music)

23:49.580 --> 23:50.473
Get the job done.

23:55.494 --> 23:57.398
Oh this is it, maybe this one.

23:57.398 --> 23:59.706
Yeah, this is the one.

23:59.706 --> 24:01.056
Yeah, you know you want it.

24:02.061 --> 24:04.382
You can file some paperwork for daddy.

24:04.382 --> 24:07.837
All these women are better
than that prude, Chloe.

24:07.837 --> 24:09.172
(dramatic music)

24:09.172 --> 24:11.326
I hope she goes further
than her preliminary.

24:11.326 --> 24:12.853
(Jeff chuckling)

24:12.853 --> 24:17.853
(suspenseful music)
(Jeff gagging)

24:24.047 --> 24:27.505
(dramatic music)

24:27.505 --> 24:29.605
- [Seahorn] That is a horrible way to die.

24:30.720 --> 24:32.790
- Coulda been a fetish thing.

24:32.790 --> 24:35.870
- Oh, good, that changes my
whole perspective on him.

24:35.870 --> 24:37.243
He was a pervert.

24:39.140 --> 24:41.807
(Seahorn sighs)

24:52.470 --> 24:53.610
What do you think this is?

24:53.610 --> 24:56.840
- It looks like the perp
might've had on padded gloves.

24:56.840 --> 24:58.190
- Yeah, maybe you're right.

24:59.550 --> 25:01.920
So what do we know about our body there?

25:01.920 --> 25:04.303
- His last call was to
a business associate.

25:05.220 --> 25:07.270
He said his business date didn't go well.

25:08.320 --> 25:10.533
- Uh huh, well then,

25:11.610 --> 25:13.963
we know who we're gonna
talk to next, don't we?

25:15.182 --> 25:17.765
(gentle music)

25:26.450 --> 25:27.650
- Morning, Bearry.

25:32.098 --> 25:34.178
- [Bearry] I love you bearry much.

25:34.178 --> 25:35.060
(Chloe giggling)

25:35.060 --> 25:36.477
- I love you too.

25:42.926 --> 25:43.829
What happened?

25:43.829 --> 25:45.426
You're hurt.

25:45.426 --> 25:48.843
(gentle music continues)

26:05.170 --> 26:06.678
All done.

26:06.678 --> 26:08.878
Do you want breakfast, Bearry?

26:08.878 --> 26:09.711
I do.

26:15.774 --> 26:18.691
(doorbell ringing)

26:19.866 --> 26:23.130
(door creaking)

26:23.130 --> 26:24.800
Hi, can I help you?

26:24.800 --> 26:25.860
- Yes, ma'am.

26:25.860 --> 26:28.909
We're detectives Clark and Seahorn.

26:28.909 --> 26:32.030
We were seeing if we can
ask you some questions.

26:32.030 --> 26:33.970
- Uh, sure, would you like to come in?

26:33.970 --> 26:35.420
- Thank you, ma'am, that would be great.

26:35.420 --> 26:36.750
This shouldn't take long.

26:36.750 --> 26:37.840
- Okay.

26:37.840 --> 26:39.267
- Just a few questions.

26:42.802 --> 26:45.719
(coffee splashing)

26:47.994 --> 26:50.661
(Seahorn sighs)

27:01.690 --> 27:03.720
- So, what's this about?

27:03.720 --> 27:06.443
- Do you know a Mr. Jeff Hardcastle?

27:07.540 --> 27:08.600
- He's my boss.

27:08.600 --> 27:10.880
Well, was my boss.

27:10.880 --> 27:12.913
- [Clark] When was the
last time you saw him?

27:12.913 --> 27:15.250
- Uh, I saw him last night.

27:15.250 --> 27:16.523
- [Seahorn] Were you working?

27:17.590 --> 27:19.640
- It was a business meeting.
- Dating?

27:19.640 --> 27:20.620
- We aren't dating.

27:20.620 --> 27:22.660
It was just dinner after work.

27:22.660 --> 27:27.043
- Uh, well, we have witnesses
that say you two were dating.

27:28.130 --> 27:30.930
- What witnesses?
- Work-related witnesses.

27:30.930 --> 27:33.853
They said they two were a thing.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.380
- We're not a thing.

27:36.380 --> 27:37.853
I was up for a promotion.

27:39.254 --> 27:41.749
Can you please tell me
what this is all about?

27:41.749 --> 27:43.550
(Seahorn clears throat)

27:43.550 --> 27:48.550
- Um, Mr. Hardcastle was
discovered dead last night.

27:51.230 --> 27:52.063
- What?

27:53.090 --> 27:55.603
How, I was just-
- We'll ask the questions.

27:56.460 --> 27:59.723
- [Seahorn] What time did
your business dinner conclude?

28:00.610 --> 28:02.583
- Around 9:00.
- Did it go well?

28:05.230 --> 28:07.260
- We won't be seeing each other again.

28:07.260 --> 28:08.770
- Yes, obviously.

28:08.770 --> 28:10.420
- Oh, my God, did you hear the great news?

28:10.420 --> 28:12.817
That motherfucking prick got
exactly what he deserves.

28:12.817 --> 28:16.877
And I when that and I thought
to myself, "You go, girl!"

28:21.750 --> 28:22.680
- [Chloe] These are the detectives

28:22.680 --> 28:24.083
investigating Jeff's death.

28:25.170 --> 28:28.840
- Oh, okay, I actually
didn't mean that she did it.

28:28.840 --> 28:32.450
I just meant that he was a dog
and he got what he deserved.

28:32.450 --> 28:36.510
- Not helping.
- Okay, I'm actually going to

28:37.510 --> 28:40.370
grab the wine and I'll be in the bedroom.

28:40.370 --> 28:42.410
(glasses clinking)
- Hold it, who are you?

28:42.410 --> 28:44.380
We may have questions for you later.

28:44.380 --> 28:46.422
- [Sam] Okay, um, talk to my lawyer.

28:46.422 --> 28:47.255
- Wait a minute!

28:49.104 --> 28:49.937
What the?

28:53.637 --> 28:54.800
(Chloe sighs)

28:54.800 --> 28:56.500
You're uh-
- Um...

28:56.500 --> 28:59.860
- You know your story
has a lot of holes in it.

28:59.860 --> 29:02.530
Would you like to fill in some of them?

29:02.530 --> 29:03.483
- Just a few?

29:08.150 --> 29:10.670
- We will check out your story, ma'am.

29:10.670 --> 29:12.400
- Not saying you're a suspect.

29:12.400 --> 29:14.090
- But everybody that knew him is.

29:14.090 --> 29:15.803
- I'll cooperate in anyway I can.

29:16.840 --> 29:17.673
- What about your friend?

29:17.673 --> 29:19.890
- Oh, she drinks a lot.

29:19.890 --> 29:21.554
We're planning an intervention.

29:21.554 --> 29:22.820
- Hm.
- Yeah.

29:22.820 --> 29:24.942
We'll be in contact.

29:24.942 --> 29:26.359
Thank you, ma'am.

29:28.811 --> 29:30.180
(light music)

29:30.180 --> 29:31.980
- What the hell?
- I know!

29:31.980 --> 29:33.470
Who the fuck let the cops in?

29:33.470 --> 29:34.860
Bad move, sister.

29:34.860 --> 29:36.510
- What was I supposed to do?

29:36.510 --> 29:39.511
- Give a girl some warning, please.

29:39.511 --> 29:41.490
(Chloe sighs)

29:41.490 --> 29:44.920
So, how's Bearry working out for ya?

29:44.920 --> 29:47.818
- He's been a comfort to
me, unlike some people.

29:47.818 --> 29:49.840
(Sam gasps)
- Harsh.

29:49.840 --> 29:51.843
You know they don't really think it's you.

29:53.070 --> 29:54.740
- They probably do now.

29:54.740 --> 29:55.763
- Grab a glass.

29:58.050 --> 29:58.910
Oh, quit worrying.

29:58.910 --> 30:00.730
You know you'd be in
silver bracelets right now

30:00.730 --> 30:02.710
if they really thought it was you.

30:02.710 --> 30:04.310
- They focused on me.

30:04.310 --> 30:05.730
- So cops have to do that.

30:05.730 --> 30:07.780
I mean, they have to weed out the guilty.

30:10.147 --> 30:11.500
- I just hope I never
have to see them again.

30:11.500 --> 30:12.853
- Ugh, yeah.

30:15.679 --> 30:17.403
- Mm, he's so comfy.

30:19.050 --> 30:20.470
- I know, right?

30:20.470 --> 30:23.730
I could just get drunk all day long

30:23.730 --> 30:25.233
and hang out with Bearry.

30:26.280 --> 30:28.370
- Back off, sister, he's mine.

30:28.370 --> 30:30.910
- And you know, it's definitely a man.

30:30.910 --> 30:32.100
Just the way he was killed.

30:32.100 --> 30:33.293
Whew, brutal.

30:35.000 --> 30:35.913
- How was he killed?

30:35.913 --> 30:36.919
(doorbell dinging)
(Sam gasps)

30:36.919 --> 30:37.752
- He's here.

30:37.752 --> 30:39.432
Oh, my God, we're in the bedroom.

30:39.432 --> 30:40.719
- Who?

30:40.719 --> 30:42.303
- Ah, there he is!
- Oh, my God.

30:42.303 --> 30:44.127
What are you doing here?

30:44.127 --> 30:47.153
- Oh, I hear you have man issues?

30:47.153 --> 30:49.091
- Oh, great.
- I'm here to help.

30:49.091 --> 30:50.570
(Luis giggling)

30:50.570 --> 30:51.500
Is all the wine gone?

30:51.500 --> 30:54.292
- [Sam] No, we have a
bunch more bottles inside.

30:54.292 --> 30:55.940
- Perfect.
- Ooh, yeah.

31:00.970 --> 31:01.853
- How did he die?

31:02.860 --> 31:04.270
- He lost his mind.

31:04.270 --> 31:06.720
No, like literally, it
went rolling on the floor.

31:09.104 --> 31:11.017
There he is.
(Luis giggling)

31:11.017 --> 31:14.223
- I need to catch up.
(Chloe sighs)

31:16.350 --> 31:19.160
- And you know, it definitely wasn't you.

31:19.160 --> 31:20.210
You're not that mean.

31:21.410 --> 31:23.100
Okay, so the first batch didn't work out.

31:23.100 --> 31:25.630
So let's get to the second batch.

31:25.630 --> 31:26.463
- No, no more, please.
- There you go.

31:26.463 --> 31:28.910
- You've done enough.
- Yeah, give me her phone.

31:28.910 --> 31:30.530
- What?

31:30.530 --> 31:31.870
- Mm hm (giggling).

31:31.870 --> 31:33.620
Okay, this is a new dating app.

31:33.620 --> 31:36.020
I found many a cute man
to spend my nights with.

31:37.040 --> 31:39.991
I've already set her up
on a few dates already.

31:39.991 --> 31:44.991
- Oh, what?
(Luis laughing)

31:49.070 --> 31:51.940
- So, I think it would be great
if you were to meet my mom

31:51.940 --> 31:54.637
because she says that if I
find a girl who I really like

31:54.637 --> 31:57.310
and makes me happy, I'll
always live in happiness.

31:57.310 --> 31:59.360
And I think you look like my mom,

31:59.360 --> 32:01.420
and I really would like
you to meet my mom.

32:01.420 --> 32:02.993
It would be really nice.

32:05.338 --> 32:09.005
(speaking foreign language)

32:44.769 --> 32:47.324
(light dramatic music)

32:47.324 --> 32:48.157
- $50,000.

32:50.630 --> 32:51.583
- What's this?

32:52.450 --> 32:56.670
- You marry me, I love you
long time, and you rich.

32:58.731 --> 33:03.070
(speaking foreign language)

33:03.070 --> 33:06.330
- I like my women like
I like my chocolate.

33:06.330 --> 33:07.723
White, mm.

33:09.160 --> 33:13.500
- I just got out of a
really bad relationship,

33:13.500 --> 33:17.820
and I was thinking about you
know, trying dating again.

33:17.820 --> 33:19.020
- I can understand that.

33:21.540 --> 33:25.853
- So, you wanna try this dating thing?

33:27.690 --> 33:28.640
- I don't think so.

33:29.530 --> 33:32.180
- Hey, you'd look great as
a leading lady in my film.

33:34.500 --> 33:36.100
But I gotta see the goods first.

33:37.559 --> 33:40.226
(hand slapping)

33:42.660 --> 33:43.680
- Sup?

33:43.680 --> 33:44.690
Name's Duane.

33:44.690 --> 33:46.730
Gotta let you know I saw
you from across the room,

33:46.730 --> 33:48.040
and if you want this to work out,

33:48.040 --> 33:49.280
you're gonna have to start working out.

33:49.280 --> 33:50.937
And that's not a problem
'cause I only charge

33:50.937 --> 33:52.100
$100 a session.

33:52.100 --> 33:53.710
And once we get that going and we get you

33:53.710 --> 33:55.667
where I need you to be,
we can start dating,

33:55.667 --> 33:58.135
and we can start dating hard.

33:58.135 --> 33:59.610
(Duane chuckling)

33:59.610 --> 34:01.280
- Maybe some other time.

34:01.280 --> 34:02.113
- For real?

34:02.113 --> 34:02.946
These could be yours.

34:05.560 --> 34:08.226
(ominous music)

34:13.260 --> 34:16.510
- Is it wrong to love somebody so much?

34:19.199 --> 34:20.033
- I gotta go.

34:33.521 --> 34:35.007
(dramatic music)

34:35.007 --> 34:37.925
(doorbell ringing)

34:52.032 --> 34:54.123
(handle rattling)

34:54.123 --> 34:56.764
(light eerie music)

34:56.764 --> 34:58.985
(intense dramatic music)

34:58.985 --> 35:00.530
What are you doing here?

35:00.530 --> 35:02.208
How'd you find me?

35:02.208 --> 35:04.870
- I followed you.
(door handle rattling)

35:04.870 --> 35:06.610
Why did you leave me?

35:06.610 --> 35:08.810
I thought things were going great.

35:08.810 --> 35:10.940
- You better leave now or
I'm calling the police.

35:10.940 --> 35:12.480
- Please don't.

35:12.480 --> 35:15.033
My probation officer
will be very mad at me.

35:16.539 --> 35:17.372
Come on.

35:18.764 --> 35:20.680
We're perfect together.

35:20.680 --> 35:21.623
I can feel it.

35:22.960 --> 35:24.743
- What are you, some kinda Jedi?

35:25.660 --> 35:28.224
- [Man] Just give me another chance.

35:28.224 --> 35:29.057
(door handle rattling)

35:29.057 --> 35:30.793
- Leave now or I'm calling the cops.

35:32.630 --> 35:33.533
- But I love you.

35:35.660 --> 35:37.263
- Leave, now!

35:38.410 --> 35:41.173
- Fine, I'll leave.

35:42.249 --> 35:43.683
But you're gonna regret it.

35:45.596 --> 35:49.096
(lips smacking)
- Oh, God.

35:52.740 --> 35:55.623
- Look, I am so sorry.

35:56.760 --> 35:59.070
I thought you'd hit it
off with one of them.

36:00.705 --> 36:02.100
- That was the biggest group of losers

36:02.100 --> 36:04.223
I've ever encountered.

36:06.100 --> 36:07.353
- You'll find a nice guy.

36:08.790 --> 36:09.793
It just takes time.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.796
- Well, at least I have Bearry.

36:16.796 --> 36:19.963
(car engine rumbling)

36:22.384 --> 36:24.884
(man sighing)

36:31.151 --> 36:33.275
- Oh, fuckin' bitch.

36:33.275 --> 36:36.275
(suspenseful music)

36:38.398 --> 36:39.984
(bottle shattering)

36:39.984 --> 36:42.571
(zipper buzzing)

36:42.571 --> 36:44.356
Look what she's missing.

36:44.356 --> 36:47.189
(leaves rustling)

36:52.260 --> 36:55.260
(suspenseful music)

37:02.233 --> 37:03.377
(dramatic music)

37:03.377 --> 37:05.180
(head squishing)
(blood splattering)

37:05.180 --> 37:07.010
- So, there's this guy at work who

37:07.010 --> 37:08.773
I really want you to meet.

37:09.730 --> 37:11.920
- No, no more help.

37:11.920 --> 37:14.650
- Well, what if I told you
that I actually liked him,

37:14.650 --> 37:16.282
but he was just way too nice.

37:16.282 --> 37:17.540
- Hm.

37:17.540 --> 37:21.820
Yeah, look, I mean if she
rejected him for being decent,

37:21.820 --> 37:23.900
you might wanna jump on that or I will.

37:23.900 --> 37:26.600
- No, I've had enough.

37:26.600 --> 37:29.490
Okay, I just started a fantastic new job,

37:29.490 --> 37:31.053
my divorce is final.

37:31.910 --> 37:33.573
Okay, you guys, I'm happy.

37:34.450 --> 37:36.483
I don't need a man right now.

37:37.520 --> 37:40.182
Besides, I have you two.

37:40.182 --> 37:41.260
(both laughing)

37:41.260 --> 37:43.760
- Well, what if I told
you that I invited him

37:43.760 --> 37:44.960
here for drinks tonight.

37:44.960 --> 37:46.570
- Mm.
- And if you don't meet him

37:46.570 --> 37:48.547
I'm gonna buy a strap-on for Bearry.

37:49.500 --> 37:50.610
- What?
- Yeah, so you're gonna

37:50.610 --> 37:53.623
meet him and you're gonna like him.

37:57.752 --> 37:59.090
(Chloe sighs)

37:59.090 --> 38:02.053
- I think you need more wine.

38:03.010 --> 38:04.533
- I don't wanna do this.

38:06.500 --> 38:09.343
- Just go along with it, okay?

38:10.190 --> 38:12.240
It's not like you have to sleep with him.

38:14.455 --> 38:16.229
- Come here, come on you go.

38:16.229 --> 38:17.253
(Sam giggling)

38:17.253 --> 38:19.587
Hey, guys, this is Ryan.

38:19.587 --> 38:21.997
- Oh, oh, God.
- He works with me.

38:21.997 --> 38:24.714
- Hi, guys, nice to meet you.

38:24.714 --> 38:27.897
- Hi, I'm Luis.

38:27.897 --> 38:29.353
(hand slapping)
- Back off, vulture.

38:31.110 --> 38:35.850
Actually, Luis and I, we
have to go tonight to church-

38:35.850 --> 38:36.683
- The mortuary.

38:38.340 --> 38:40.440
- We actually meant we have to go

38:40.440 --> 38:42.460
to the mortuary-
- Church.

38:43.520 --> 38:45.290
- Okay, come on, Luis.

38:45.290 --> 38:47.300
You entertain my friend here.

38:47.300 --> 38:48.697
Take good care of him.

38:50.017 --> 38:51.240
- That was subtle.

38:51.240 --> 38:52.880
- Well, you know what?

38:52.880 --> 38:54.010
I think they're gonna work out.

38:54.010 --> 38:55.683
He was just too nice for me.

38:59.600 --> 39:01.980
- I am so sorry about this.

39:01.980 --> 39:04.130
I didn't know about
this until just before.

39:05.090 --> 39:06.630
- It's not your fault.

39:06.630 --> 39:07.773
She is who she is.

39:09.180 --> 39:10.970
Do you wanna have a seat?

39:10.970 --> 39:11.803
- Sure.

39:15.180 --> 39:17.001
Well, it is refreshing to work with her.

39:17.001 --> 39:18.551
She always does make you laugh.

39:21.770 --> 39:23.313
- You seem like a nice guy.

39:24.330 --> 39:25.480
You don't have to stay.

39:27.250 --> 39:29.150
- You seem nice too, and I wanna stay.

39:32.450 --> 39:34.450
So, looks like we're
both stuck here together.

39:34.450 --> 39:36.820
Might as well make the most of it, right?

39:36.820 --> 39:37.970
I'm a really good cook.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.420
So, what do you say I say
thank you for your hospitality

39:41.420 --> 39:42.720
by making you a nice meal?

39:44.591 --> 39:47.170
- I don't have anything here to cook.

39:47.170 --> 39:49.560
- Okay, well, how about
I take you out to dinner?

39:49.560 --> 39:52.830
You pick the place.
(Chloe sighs)

39:52.830 --> 39:55.883
- Well, there is this restaurant I go to.

39:57.530 --> 39:58.880
I eat there a lot actually.

40:03.662 --> 40:05.947
- May I have the honor of
taking you out to dinner?

40:12.197 --> 40:14.228
(Ryan chuckling)
(Chloe giggling)

40:14.228 --> 40:16.260
(light romantic music)

40:16.260 --> 40:18.370
- I'm sorry for talking so much.

40:18.370 --> 40:20.500
- No, no, get it off your chest.

40:20.500 --> 40:22.250
It's not good to hold in bad stuff.

40:25.084 --> 40:27.300
Did I say something wrong?

40:27.300 --> 40:30.090
- No, it's just the last time I had dinner

40:30.090 --> 40:32.107
with someone it didn't end well.

40:33.161 --> 40:35.244
- Well, I'm not that guy.

40:39.644 --> 40:42.375
An average guy, not as crazy as Sam.

40:42.375 --> 40:44.010
(Chloe giggling)

40:44.010 --> 40:44.843
- Thank you.

40:48.579 --> 40:50.756
- Can I share something?

40:50.756 --> 40:54.095
- Please do, I would like that.

40:54.095 --> 40:56.843
- Are you guys ready to order?

40:56.843 --> 40:59.636
- Yeah, are you ready?
- Yeah.

40:59.636 --> 41:02.886
(light romantic music)

41:13.555 --> 41:15.195
Thank you.

41:15.195 --> 41:16.835
I had a really nice time.

41:16.835 --> 41:18.287
- I'm so glad.

41:18.287 --> 41:19.120
I did too.

41:20.839 --> 41:22.839
Now, I've got a request.

41:26.690 --> 41:27.523
- What?

41:29.034 --> 41:31.311
- I had a really wonderful time.

41:31.311 --> 41:33.478
I'd love to see you again.

41:36.123 --> 41:38.456
- I will grant that request.

41:41.247 --> 41:43.914
(lips smacking)

41:48.991 --> 41:51.658
(keys jingling)

42:00.665 --> 42:03.332
(Ryan laughing)

42:07.867 --> 42:10.590
Let me tell you about the best date ever!

42:10.590 --> 42:14.061
I can't believe how kind and gentle he is.

42:14.061 --> 42:14.894
(Chloe sighs)

42:14.894 --> 42:16.961
This one's a keeper I think.

42:16.961 --> 42:18.281
(Chloe squealing)

42:18.281 --> 42:20.813
And to think he came from Sam.

42:22.033 --> 42:25.981
(Chloe sighs)
(Chloe giggling)

42:25.981 --> 42:27.917
(lips smacking)

42:27.917 --> 42:30.834
(light rock music)

42:34.591 --> 42:37.341
(knife clicking)

42:40.313 --> 42:43.600
- I had so much fun with you last night.

42:43.600 --> 42:46.267
So, when do I get to see you again?

42:48.861 --> 42:49.694
Sounds good.
(glass shattering)

42:49.694 --> 42:52.361
(ominous music)

42:57.124 --> 42:58.957
I don't know, nothing.

43:00.785 --> 43:02.390
(suspenseful music)

43:02.390 --> 43:04.113
Hey, Chloe, can I call you back?

43:06.440 --> 43:07.273
Thanks.

43:23.385 --> 43:25.979
(Ryan sighs)

43:25.979 --> 43:28.979
(suspenseful music)

43:36.632 --> 43:38.601
(flesh squishing)
(Ryan gagging)

43:38.601 --> 43:41.268
(body thudding)

43:45.240 --> 43:47.630
- [Sam] You know he didn't
come into work either.

43:47.630 --> 43:49.503
Don't read too much into this.

43:50.760 --> 43:53.180
- We hit it off so well.

43:53.180 --> 43:56.870
You actually came through
and found me an awesome guy.

43:56.870 --> 43:58.083
He said he'd call back.

43:59.300 --> 44:01.950
Doesn't seem like the type
of person who plays games.

44:03.130 --> 44:04.180
Is he?

44:04.180 --> 44:06.110
- I don't know, he's kind of like a loner.

44:06.110 --> 44:08.863
I think he's the type that
just goes off into nature.

44:10.260 --> 44:11.810
- Oh, that reminds me.

44:11.810 --> 44:13.960
Dad wanted to go camping next weekend.

44:13.960 --> 44:15.540
- Okay, not now, sweetheart.

44:15.540 --> 44:17.640
- I didn't say now.

44:17.640 --> 44:19.330
I said next weekend.

44:19.330 --> 44:20.610
- Okay, you know what, Angela?

44:20.610 --> 44:22.620
You're gonna go home, do your chores,

44:22.620 --> 44:25.080
or you're gonna be camping
in your room for a month.

44:25.080 --> 44:27.733
Go.
(Angela scoffs)

44:28.720 --> 44:29.553
Seriously?

44:31.758 --> 44:32.650
(Chloe sighs)

44:32.650 --> 44:35.200
He's a hippie, he'll call you.

44:35.200 --> 44:36.490
- I hope so.

44:36.490 --> 44:37.870
I really liked him.

44:37.870 --> 44:40.140
- Let's not focus on him not calling.

44:40.140 --> 44:42.650
Let's celebrate the fact
that he's in your life.

44:42.650 --> 44:43.700
(Sam gasps)

44:43.700 --> 44:45.950
Let's go to your favorite
restaurant tonight.

44:47.400 --> 44:49.100
- You really are a good friend.

44:49.100 --> 44:50.050
- Better than Luis?

44:51.184 --> 44:52.782
Oh!
- Oh!

44:52.782 --> 44:54.950
(Chloe laughing)
- Eh, eh, eh.

44:54.950 --> 44:56.760
- Ah, shit.

44:56.760 --> 44:58.040
Poor guy.

44:58.040 --> 44:59.030
- Looks like he was on the phone

44:59.030 --> 45:02.410
with Chloe before he got butchered.

45:02.410 --> 45:05.130
- Well, then, I guess that moves her right

45:05.130 --> 45:06.773
to the top of our list.

45:07.644 --> 45:10.644
(light eerie music)

45:16.600 --> 45:19.850
(light romantic music)

45:23.090 --> 45:24.860
- Evening, officers.

45:24.860 --> 45:25.910
- Is it that obvious?

45:28.020 --> 45:29.423
- Well, I guess so.

45:29.423 --> 45:31.270
- Ah, and I thought we looked just like

45:31.270 --> 45:33.103
a pair of insurance agents.

45:34.224 --> 45:35.970
- What can I get you guys to eat?

45:35.970 --> 45:36.996
- Donuts.

45:36.996 --> 45:39.810
- And a cup of coffee please, sweets.

45:39.810 --> 45:42.750
And a little information
on one of your patrons.

45:42.750 --> 45:44.407
- Do you know this woman?

45:44.407 --> 45:46.938
- Um, yeah, she's been in
here from time to time.

45:46.938 --> 45:48.930
- Oh, my God, that is the girl

45:48.930 --> 45:51.143
that you drool over every time.

45:53.817 --> 45:57.180
- Well, well, well, that is interesting.

45:57.180 --> 45:59.963
So, you've seen her in here with a man?

46:01.190 --> 46:02.940
- Like a date?
- Yes, like a date.

46:04.360 --> 46:06.310
- Perhaps with this person?

46:06.310 --> 46:07.900
- Yeah, he's been in here.

46:07.900 --> 46:09.770
- That guy is a real piece of work!

46:09.770 --> 46:10.603
- Kelly!

46:11.980 --> 46:13.210
- I'll check on my tables.

46:13.210 --> 46:14.670
- What about him?

46:14.670 --> 46:16.000
What do you know about him?

46:16.000 --> 46:18.403
- So she's been in here
with different men?

46:19.530 --> 46:20.363
- What can I tell you?

46:20.363 --> 46:21.659
I mean, I didn't talk to them.

46:21.659 --> 46:25.553
- Did it look like
somebody was getting some?

46:25.553 --> 46:27.843
- It seemed to be going okay.

46:27.843 --> 46:28.676
- Huh.

46:31.747 --> 46:34.681
Thank you for the information.

46:34.681 --> 46:35.731
We'll be in touch.

46:35.731 --> 46:38.314
(hand tapping)

46:41.683 --> 46:43.600
(Chloe gasps)

46:43.600 --> 46:45.300
Well, well, well.

46:45.300 --> 46:48.130
Hello, Chloe.

46:48.130 --> 46:50.478
- What are you guys doing here?

46:50.478 --> 46:53.123
- We came to sample some local cuisine.

46:54.060 --> 46:56.330
We learned a lot about
this spot, didn't we?

46:56.330 --> 46:57.203
- Oh, yeah.

46:58.100 --> 47:00.550
We learned a lot.

47:00.550 --> 47:04.090
- Were you here last night
and last Wednesday night?

47:04.090 --> 47:06.187
- Well, I-
- No, she was with me,

47:06.187 --> 47:07.070
and another friend.

47:07.070 --> 47:09.293
Now, either arrest her or leave her alone.

47:10.880 --> 47:13.470
- What's going on?
- Don't worry about it.

47:13.470 --> 47:14.463
We'll be in touch.

47:18.802 --> 47:20.102
- What did you say to those guys?

47:20.102 --> 47:21.030
- Nothing.

47:21.030 --> 47:23.446
- Yeah, well, why are
they acting like that?

47:23.446 --> 47:26.060
- They asked simple questions,
I gave them simple answers.

47:26.060 --> 47:28.540
They asked about that creep
and then the nice guy.

47:28.540 --> 47:29.730
- Who?

47:29.730 --> 47:31.610
- The nice guy from the other night.

47:31.610 --> 47:32.510
- What happened to him?

47:32.510 --> 47:34.270
- I don't know, they were
fishing hard for something.

47:34.270 --> 47:35.140
I don't know what it is,

47:35.140 --> 47:38.010
but you need to figure out your next move.

47:38.010 --> 47:39.010
- Come on, let's go.

47:41.726 --> 47:43.027
(door creaking)

47:43.027 --> 47:45.944
(lighter clicking)

47:46.970 --> 47:48.970
Why are they thinking you're involved?

47:48.970 --> 47:50.170
- Oh, I don't know.

47:50.170 --> 47:52.290
Maybe because they found
my boss dead right after

47:52.290 --> 47:53.450
I went out to dinner with him?

47:53.450 --> 47:54.800
And now Ryan's missing.

47:54.800 --> 47:56.950
- Is there something
you're not telling me?

47:57.830 --> 47:58.950
- What?

47:58.950 --> 48:00.915
Do you think I had
something to do with this?

48:00.915 --> 48:02.630
(Sam sighs)

48:02.630 --> 48:03.630
- I'm not accusing you.

48:03.630 --> 48:06.050
It's just that yes,
first, there's your boss.

48:06.050 --> 48:07.330
Then, there's Ryan.

48:07.330 --> 48:09.180
Is there something you wanna tell me?

48:10.570 --> 48:12.670
- I just wanna know what happened to Ryan.

48:14.960 --> 48:18.043
- Are you sure there isn't more to this?

48:20.420 --> 48:22.543
- Yes, Sam, I'm sure!

48:26.794 --> 48:27.627
God.

48:35.240 --> 48:36.940
No, I told you everything.

48:36.940 --> 48:38.690
I met him that one time.

48:38.690 --> 48:40.350
He was a fucking creep and I left.

48:40.350 --> 48:41.580
That's it.

48:41.580 --> 48:44.980
These detectives' questions
are borderline harassment.

48:44.980 --> 48:45.813
- All right, sweetheart.

48:45.813 --> 48:48.070
Listen, I believe you and
I love you, you know that,

48:48.070 --> 48:49.483
but I have to ask.

48:51.930 --> 48:55.800
Just give me a day and
I'll contact my lawyer.

48:55.800 --> 48:57.600
Okay?
- Yeah.

48:57.600 --> 49:00.480
Thank you so much, Sam.
- Aw, give me a hug.

49:00.480 --> 49:02.279
It's gonna be all right.
(lips smacking)

49:02.279 --> 49:04.779
(Sam sighing)

49:06.515 --> 49:09.182
(door slamming)

49:11.563 --> 49:13.420
(Andrew clears throat)

49:13.420 --> 49:15.530
- What are you doing here?

49:15.530 --> 49:16.830
- I have a key.

49:16.830 --> 49:17.890
- This is my house.

49:17.890 --> 49:19.950
- Yeah, in all your
attempts to get over me,

49:19.950 --> 49:22.583
you never even thought
to change the locks?

49:23.439 --> 49:25.840
(Andrew chuckling)

49:25.840 --> 49:27.850
Nice to hear about the investigation.

49:27.850 --> 49:30.360
My lawyer is just gonna love that.

49:30.360 --> 49:32.510
May even renegotiate whose house this is.

49:32.510 --> 49:35.503
- Get the fuck out.

49:36.700 --> 49:40.150
- Baby, you are never
gonna have it as good

49:40.150 --> 49:41.250
as you had it with me.

49:42.210 --> 49:43.430
- You know what?

49:43.430 --> 49:44.900
I found someone better than you.

49:44.900 --> 49:46.550
- Oh, please.

49:46.550 --> 49:47.980
Quit showing off.

49:47.980 --> 49:49.660
Nobody cares about you.

49:49.660 --> 49:51.510
All that you have is my house

49:51.510 --> 49:53.680
and that neurotic little friend of yours.

49:53.680 --> 49:55.290
- I have someone that cares for me.

49:55.290 --> 49:56.123
- Oh, yeah?

49:56.123 --> 49:57.083
What's his name?

49:58.860 --> 50:00.263
- His name?
- Yeah.

50:02.220 --> 50:03.150
- His name is Stephen.

50:03.150 --> 50:04.880
- It's that right there.

50:04.880 --> 50:06.500
Right there, you hesitated.

50:06.500 --> 50:07.333
See, I know you.

50:07.333 --> 50:09.503
You are lying.
- Fuck you.

50:12.550 --> 50:15.119
- I'm gonna need your wedding ring.

50:15.119 --> 50:16.910
See, I fucked up with the new girl.

50:16.910 --> 50:18.780
I accidentally called her the
wrong name in the bedroom,

50:18.780 --> 50:21.550
and I gotta play nice.

50:21.550 --> 50:22.923
- Absolutely not!

50:25.370 --> 50:26.377
- Tell you what.

50:26.377 --> 50:30.410
Either you give me the
ring or I go tell the cops

50:30.410 --> 50:32.915
that you threatened me with a knife.

50:32.915 --> 50:34.947
How do you think that's
gonna go over with 'em?

50:38.700 --> 50:40.290
Yeah.

50:40.290 --> 50:41.990
Yeah, good girl.

50:41.990 --> 50:43.140
That's what I thought.

50:49.099 --> 50:52.016
(drawers thudding)

51:16.630 --> 51:17.463
Found it.

51:23.340 --> 51:24.827
Will she ever fucking grow up?

51:24.827 --> 51:26.180
Goddamn teddy bear.

51:30.007 --> 51:32.674
(ominous music)

51:35.918 --> 51:38.835
(shower pattering)

51:42.856 --> 51:45.523
(bugs chirping)

51:49.863 --> 51:52.446
(Andrew sighs)

51:53.371 --> 51:56.204
(water splashing)

53:12.564 --> 53:15.314
(dramatic music)

53:30.105 --> 53:31.280
(Andrew screaming)

53:31.280 --> 53:33.748
(chainsaw whirring)

53:33.748 --> 53:38.748
(flesh squishing)
(Andrew groaning)

53:45.588 --> 53:48.421
- [Bearry] I love you bearry much.

53:51.001 --> 53:53.501
(eerie music)

54:19.929 --> 54:23.179
(light romantic music)

54:28.877 --> 54:30.603
- [Katelyn] Eating alone tonight?

54:31.860 --> 54:32.693
- Yeah.

54:35.430 --> 54:36.263
- I like it.

54:37.400 --> 54:38.313
It's peaceful.

54:40.770 --> 54:41.920
I get to enjoy my meal.

54:44.130 --> 54:46.463
- I don't like eating alone.

54:48.452 --> 54:51.452
- [Katelyn] You'll learn to like it.

54:53.712 --> 54:57.255
(chair creaking)

54:57.255 --> 54:58.490
- Hey, Chloe.

54:58.490 --> 54:59.390
How are you doing?

55:01.180 --> 55:02.430
- I'm feeling kinda down.

55:04.712 --> 55:06.712
- Let me buy you dinner.

55:08.430 --> 55:11.963
- That's my boy.
(mouth clicking)

55:18.891 --> 55:21.558
(ominous music)

55:41.262 --> 55:45.884
(Stephen chuckling)
(Chloe laughing)

55:45.884 --> 55:48.100
- It's good to see you laugh.

55:48.100 --> 55:51.500
- Yeah, there hasn't been
much laughing lately.

55:51.500 --> 55:53.400
- Come on, there's plenty to laugh at.

55:54.380 --> 55:55.780
- [Kelly] Stephen, I'm done.

55:56.800 --> 55:59.573
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

56:02.851 --> 56:04.230
- Good night, Kelly.

56:04.230 --> 56:06.250
See you tomorrow.
- Good night.

56:06.250 --> 56:08.750
- [Kelly] I'm sure it will be.

56:15.658 --> 56:17.133
- Would you like to go out with me?

56:19.528 --> 56:21.278
- That would be nice.

56:24.027 --> 56:26.610
(gentle music)

56:49.527 --> 56:52.103
(monster roaring)

56:52.103 --> 56:55.520
(gentle music continues)

57:14.663 --> 57:17.413
(dramatic music)

57:21.866 --> 57:24.783
(glass shattering)

57:31.431 --> 57:33.931
(light music)

58:13.912 --> 58:16.412
(eerie music)

58:21.667 --> 58:24.334
(ominous music)

58:28.685 --> 58:31.268
(gentle music)

59:12.460 --> 59:13.853
- I feel used.

59:16.475 --> 59:17.640
(Chloe laughing)

59:17.640 --> 59:19.120
- You looked so peaceful.

59:19.120 --> 59:20.830
I didn't wanna wake you.

59:20.830 --> 59:22.320
- So what is this?

59:22.320 --> 59:23.933
A wham, bam, thank you, ma'am?

59:25.250 --> 59:27.600
- I'll come by later for
dinner if that's okay.

59:28.450 --> 59:31.163
- I'd love that.
(soft music)

59:34.464 --> 59:37.131
(lips smacking)

59:41.270 --> 59:42.483
Hey, that's my shirt!

59:51.237 --> 59:53.320
- Mm, I love you, Bearry.

59:56.310 --> 59:58.333
- [Bearry] I love you bearry much.

1:00:00.063 --> 1:00:02.320
- I think I finally met the right one.

1:00:02.320 --> 1:00:04.380
Stephen and Chloe.

1:00:04.380 --> 1:00:06.230
It has a nice ring to it, doesn't it?

1:00:07.800 --> 1:00:09.150
I'm really falling for him.

1:00:10.621 --> 1:00:13.371
(Chloe giggling)

1:00:19.710 --> 1:00:20.543
- All right.

1:00:23.430 --> 1:00:26.243
Thanks.
(ominous music)

1:00:28.330 --> 1:00:29.163
(Stephen sighs)

1:00:29.163 --> 1:00:30.963
What am I doing?

1:00:32.908 --> 1:00:34.130
I don't even like these kinda girls.

1:00:34.130 --> 1:00:36.833
She's, she's too young.

1:00:38.924 --> 1:00:40.463
Oh, but she makes me laugh.

1:00:41.470 --> 1:00:42.493
Who am I kidding?

1:00:43.510 --> 1:00:44.920
I love her.

1:00:44.920 --> 1:00:46.643
What the hell?
(Stephen screaming)

1:00:46.643 --> 1:00:51.632
(flesh squishing)
(Stephen groaning)

1:00:51.632 --> 1:00:54.882
(light dramatic music)

1:01:05.960 --> 1:01:10.960
- First the boss, then the
date, now an ex-husband.

1:01:17.760 --> 1:01:22.760
- You reckon we got enough
evidence now to arrest her?

1:01:23.090 --> 1:01:24.123
- Oh, yeah.

1:01:26.400 --> 1:01:27.233
- Good.

1:01:28.500 --> 1:01:29.433
Let's do it.

1:01:32.743 --> 1:01:34.240
(ominous music)

1:01:34.240 --> 1:01:36.480
- Hey, Stephen, it's Chloe again.

1:01:36.480 --> 1:01:38.960
I've been trying to ahold of
you for the past few hours.

1:01:38.960 --> 1:01:40.610
Just wanna make sure you're okay.

1:01:41.840 --> 1:01:43.752
(phone beeping)
(Chloe sighs)

1:01:43.752 --> 1:01:47.252
(ominous music continues)

1:01:52.508 --> 1:01:55.788
(dramatic music)

1:01:55.788 --> 1:01:56.724
Bearry?

1:01:56.724 --> 1:01:59.547
- [Bearry] I love you bearry much.

1:01:59.547 --> 1:02:01.504
- [Chloe] Bearry?

1:02:01.504 --> 1:02:04.171
(Chloe gasping)

1:02:06.200 --> 1:02:09.617
(intense dramatic music)

1:02:13.668 --> 1:02:16.335
(Chloe panting)

1:02:26.968 --> 1:02:30.532
(Chloe screaming)

1:02:30.532 --> 1:02:34.782
(intense dramatic music continues)

1:02:42.840 --> 1:02:45.673
(Chloe screaming)

1:02:51.374 --> 1:02:53.242
- What are you doing here?
- That fucking teddy bear.

1:02:53.242 --> 1:02:55.582
(Chloe screaming)

1:02:55.582 --> 1:02:56.415
Chloe!

1:02:58.883 --> 1:03:01.447
Get!
(foot thudding)

1:03:01.447 --> 1:03:04.364
(Chloe whimpering)

1:03:09.475 --> 1:03:12.040
- What the fuck are you talking about?

1:03:12.040 --> 1:03:14.100
There is nothing wrong
with this bear, okay?

1:03:14.100 --> 1:03:15.660
He's fine, look at him.

1:03:15.660 --> 1:03:16.510
He's fine.

1:03:16.510 --> 1:03:17.827
He's just a bear.

1:03:17.827 --> 1:03:19.520
I don't understand you guys.
(dramatic music)

1:03:19.520 --> 1:03:21.960
It's just Bearry, okay?

1:03:21.960 --> 1:03:24.393
(flesh squishing)
(Sam screaming)

1:03:24.393 --> 1:03:26.834
- Come on, come on.
- No!

1:03:26.834 --> 1:03:29.501
(Sam screaming)

1:03:30.532 --> 1:03:33.199
(ominous music)

1:03:37.658 --> 1:03:40.825
(car engine rumbling)

1:03:43.190 --> 1:03:46.190
(suspenseful music)

1:04:20.536 --> 1:04:23.203
(ominous music)

1:04:26.937 --> 1:04:29.770
- [Bearry] I love you bearry much.

1:04:37.760 --> 1:04:40.427
(gate creaking)

1:04:44.160 --> 1:04:46.223
- Hey, Chloe, have you seen my mom?

1:04:48.284 --> 1:04:49.117
Mom?

1:04:50.840 --> 1:04:53.433
Mom?
(dramatic music)

1:04:53.433 --> 1:04:54.770
Mom!

1:04:54.770 --> 1:04:56.204
Mom, are you okay?

1:04:56.204 --> 1:04:57.037
Mom!

1:04:58.485 --> 1:05:00.439
- Angela.
- Mom!

1:05:00.439 --> 1:05:02.401
- My beautiful daughter.

1:05:02.401 --> 1:05:05.984
How was camping?
- Mom, what?

1:05:05.984 --> 1:05:07.998
Mom, what happened to you?

1:05:07.998 --> 1:05:08.831
Mom?

1:05:10.045 --> 1:05:11.342
Mom?

1:05:11.342 --> 1:05:13.158
Someone help!

1:05:13.158 --> 1:05:18.158
(ominous music)
(birds cawing)

1:05:40.798 --> 1:05:43.798
(suspenseful music)

1:05:44.729 --> 1:05:48.460
(light dramatic music)

1:05:48.460 --> 1:05:50.240
- Are you okay?

1:05:50.240 --> 1:05:51.073
- Thank you.

1:06:03.045 --> 1:06:05.962
(gravel crunching)

1:06:07.389 --> 1:06:10.056
(steam hissing)

1:06:13.109 --> 1:06:14.693
- Okay, try it.

1:06:14.693 --> 1:06:16.260
(car clicking)

1:06:16.260 --> 1:06:17.210
- It's not working.

1:06:20.873 --> 1:06:22.433
- All right, how about now?

1:06:23.395 --> 1:06:25.380
(car clicking)

1:06:25.380 --> 1:06:26.213
- Nothing.

1:06:30.300 --> 1:06:32.248
- All right, one more time.

1:06:32.248 --> 1:06:35.592
(car engine rumbling)

1:06:35.592 --> 1:06:38.992
(hood slamming)

1:06:38.992 --> 1:06:40.795
- What happened last night?

1:06:40.795 --> 1:06:43.205
- It's a teddy bear!
(Chloe gasps)

1:06:43.205 --> 1:06:44.288
- Oh, my God.

1:06:45.950 --> 1:06:47.363
Oh, my God, she's got a gun.

1:06:48.572 --> 1:06:49.613
- [Stephen] Hey, I've seen you.

1:06:50.696 --> 1:06:53.610
- Wait, you're the lady
from the restaurant.

1:06:53.610 --> 1:06:55.390
- There's a teddy bear trying to kill you,

1:06:55.390 --> 1:06:58.517
and you're worried
about who the fuck I am!

1:06:58.517 --> 1:07:00.488
- Wait, it killed her
friend, it stabbed me,

1:07:00.488 --> 1:07:02.090
and it tried to rape her.

1:07:02.090 --> 1:07:03.873
- It's killed everyone around us.

1:07:05.200 --> 1:07:07.343
- We have to get as far
away from here as we can.

1:07:10.684 --> 1:07:15.684
(birds cawing)
(eerie music)

1:07:16.080 --> 1:07:17.633
Come on, let's go!

1:07:23.048 --> 1:07:26.215
(car engine rumbling)

1:07:32.640 --> 1:07:34.432
(steam hissing)

1:07:34.432 --> 1:07:36.060
- Goddammit!

1:07:36.060 --> 1:07:37.573
We're not going anywhere.

1:07:39.167 --> 1:07:40.203
- Can you fix it?

1:07:41.308 --> 1:07:43.180
- Not without my tools.

1:07:43.180 --> 1:07:45.123
'Cause I've been working on
it when all this shit started.

1:07:46.150 --> 1:07:49.700
- You know, this might just work.

1:07:49.700 --> 1:07:51.963
I mean, we're out in
the middle of nowhere.

1:07:53.140 --> 1:07:55.450
Bearry might not be able to find us.

1:07:55.450 --> 1:07:57.000
Let's go.

1:07:57.000 --> 1:07:57.833
- Where?

1:07:59.605 --> 1:08:01.883
- I know a hunter's shack nearby.

1:08:01.883 --> 1:08:03.383
There may be some tools there.

1:08:07.740 --> 1:08:08.573
- I'll go fist.

1:08:12.651 --> 1:08:15.300
- Do you think she's
using him to get away?

1:08:15.300 --> 1:08:16.133
- Has to be.

1:08:17.360 --> 1:08:19.226
She's running out of options.

1:08:19.226 --> 1:08:20.960
She knows she's about to be exposed.

1:08:20.960 --> 1:08:24.112
- Yeah, yeah.

1:08:24.950 --> 1:08:26.530
I just don't get it.

1:08:26.530 --> 1:08:29.563
I mean, she seemed like a
perfectly normal person.

1:08:30.899 --> 1:08:33.210
What do you think makes
someone do something like this?

1:08:33.210 --> 1:08:34.343
- Man, people snap.

1:08:35.660 --> 1:08:36.493
- Yeah.

1:08:37.360 --> 1:08:40.027
(ominous music)

1:08:48.246 --> 1:08:51.496
(light dramatic music)

1:09:37.476 --> 1:09:40.444
This ain't going anywhere soon.

1:09:40.444 --> 1:09:43.194
- Let's just go a little further.

1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:46.510
- [Seahorn] Wait, wait,
wait, wait, stop, stop.

1:09:48.569 --> 1:09:51.406
Over there.
(Clark gasps)

1:09:51.406 --> 1:09:56.202
- I'll be damned.
(Seahorn chuckling)

1:09:56.202 --> 1:09:59.607
- That looks like our Hummer.

1:10:00.480 --> 1:10:03.063
(gun clicking)

1:10:03.950 --> 1:10:04.843
Let's go get her.

1:10:06.350 --> 1:10:07.350
- Let's finish this.

1:10:08.286 --> 1:10:09.731
(bugs chirping)
(door creaking)

1:10:09.731 --> 1:10:12.620
(eerie music)

1:10:12.620 --> 1:10:13.452
- Hello?

1:10:16.712 --> 1:10:18.045
Is anybody here?

1:10:38.513 --> 1:10:41.683
Sit.
(Chloe gasps)

1:10:41.683 --> 1:10:45.190
- I don't think anybody lives here.

1:10:45.190 --> 1:10:46.190
- I know this place.

1:10:49.420 --> 1:10:52.193
It used to be a testing site for MK Ultra.

1:10:53.040 --> 1:10:53.933
It's abandoned.

1:10:58.309 --> 1:10:59.559
- I don't see any lights.

1:11:00.963 --> 1:11:02.702
- Ah, I go outside and try
and see if there's like

1:11:02.702 --> 1:11:06.340
a generator or a breaker or something.

1:11:06.340 --> 1:11:07.389
- [Chloe] Be careful.

1:11:09.413 --> 1:11:14.413
(bugs chirping)
(light eerie music)

1:11:35.222 --> 1:11:36.972
- What is this place?

1:11:43.348 --> 1:11:44.181
Ah, bingo.

1:11:51.621 --> 1:11:52.788
Ah, let's see.

1:11:58.248 --> 1:12:01.498
(generator sputtering)

1:12:06.816 --> 1:12:08.688
(generator rumbling)

1:12:08.688 --> 1:12:10.893
- Oh.
- Oh, much better.

1:12:16.992 --> 1:12:19.992
(light eerie music)

1:12:29.500 --> 1:12:31.500
- I don't see any tools.

1:12:38.087 --> 1:12:39.637
- Did you see any fuel outside?

1:12:40.862 --> 1:12:43.635
- Yeah, there's a bunch
of cans by the generator.

1:12:43.635 --> 1:12:45.532
- Okay, let's build a fire.

1:12:57.715 --> 1:13:02.389
(bugs chirping)
(fire crackling)

1:13:02.389 --> 1:13:03.290
(ominous music)

1:13:03.290 --> 1:13:06.680
- Where'd you learn to
build a fire like that?

1:13:06.680 --> 1:13:08.300
- You've never been camping?

1:13:08.300 --> 1:13:10.770
- No, I never got the chance to go,

1:13:10.770 --> 1:13:12.827
but I've always wanted to.

1:13:14.598 --> 1:13:17.460
- When all this is over,
I'll take you camping.

1:13:19.630 --> 1:13:20.980
- Sorry about your friends.

1:13:24.398 --> 1:13:25.982
There will be more.

1:13:30.447 --> 1:13:33.447
They can hide like a government fly.

1:13:35.240 --> 1:13:36.073
- Government?

1:13:37.660 --> 1:13:38.493
- Fly.

1:13:39.950 --> 1:13:41.793
They program them to spy on us.

1:13:44.693 --> 1:13:45.526
- Okay.

1:13:46.870 --> 1:13:48.103
- How can he be stopped?

1:13:53.746 --> 1:13:55.923
- Bearry was a gift
after my daughter died.

1:13:58.809 --> 1:14:00.853
He's killed everyone around me.

1:14:02.100 --> 1:14:02.933
- How?

1:14:05.490 --> 1:14:07.139
- He was just a normal teddy bear

1:14:08.829 --> 1:14:11.223
till I said those magical words.

1:14:13.084 --> 1:14:15.282
I love you bearry much.

1:14:17.550 --> 1:14:20.043
He went from being just
a normal teddy bear,

1:14:21.410 --> 1:14:22.593
to being alive.

1:14:24.041 --> 1:14:25.241
- I just wanna know how.

1:14:26.210 --> 1:14:27.730
- I don't know.

1:14:27.730 --> 1:14:29.550
I've been trying to stop him ever since

1:14:29.550 --> 1:14:30.880
I realized what he was.

1:14:30.880 --> 1:14:33.570
He always chooses new owners.

1:14:33.570 --> 1:14:35.740
- Yeah, me.

1:14:35.740 --> 1:14:36.777
- Not just you.

1:14:38.210 --> 1:14:39.943
Bearry's killed many families.

1:14:41.210 --> 1:14:42.713
You're just next in line.

1:14:44.820 --> 1:14:47.730
Between him and the reptilians,

1:14:47.730 --> 1:14:49.717
I don't know who's killed more.

1:14:49.717 --> 1:14:50.617
- Reptilians?

1:14:50.617 --> 1:14:52.809
Are you fucking crazy?

1:14:52.809 --> 1:14:56.513
- Oh, no, they're building
a new master race.

1:14:58.840 --> 1:15:00.516
- I don't even know what to make of that.

1:15:00.516 --> 1:15:03.530
- Look, we have to prepare.

1:15:03.530 --> 1:15:04.853
- We're not leaving.

1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:07.617
- How are we going to stop him?

1:15:08.800 --> 1:15:10.351
- How do you kill a teddy bear?

1:15:11.710 --> 1:15:12.633
- With a toy gun?

1:15:14.210 --> 1:15:19.210
- No, we kill him with fire.
(dramatic music)

1:15:20.407 --> 1:15:22.443
- [Bearry] I love you bearry much.

1:15:22.443 --> 1:15:23.585
(suspenseful music)

1:15:23.585 --> 1:15:25.644
(Chloe gasping)
- Go, go, save yourselves.
