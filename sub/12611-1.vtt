00:46.254 --> 00:48.055
A wild new cowboy on the move.

00:48.156 --> 00:52.560
He placed last night, second.
Going for first.

00:54.329 --> 00:56.231
How many y'all wanna see that replay?

00:58.333 --> 01:01.736
Following cowboy in hot water.

01:05.840 --> 01:07.742
Come on big Jake, show 'em how.

01:07.842 --> 01:10.345
Yeah.

02:29.524 --> 02:32.660
Mission sequence start.

02:32.760 --> 02:34.929
Engines on five, four...

02:35.029 --> 02:36.864
Three, two...

03:27.582 --> 03:30.385
I'm the luckiest
human being in the world.

03:30.485 --> 03:33.821
There... fire going.

03:33.921 --> 03:35.890
I don't go around living in the past,

03:35.990 --> 03:39.560
for the most part.

03:39.660 --> 03:41.362
But ever once in while

03:41.462 --> 03:43.931
you let yourself go back in time.

03:47.602 --> 03:50.405
I'll look up there...

03:50.505 --> 03:51.906
And I might just reflect

03:52.006 --> 03:55.276
for a half a minute or so.

03:56.777 --> 03:58.979
I can take myself there
at the speed of thought.

04:06.921 --> 04:09.924
Okay, stand by for pitchover.

04:10.024 --> 04:13.761
Oh, are we coming in?

04:13.861 --> 04:14.929
Pitchover.

04:15.029 --> 04:16.430
There it is. Proceeded.

04:16.531 --> 04:17.765
And there it is Houston.

04:17.865 --> 04:19.800
There's Camelot. Right on target.

04:19.899 --> 04:21.336
I see it.

04:21.435 --> 04:23.003
We got 'em all. 42 degrees.

04:24.805 --> 04:26.774
25 feet per second through 400.

04:26.874 --> 04:27.775
That's a little high, geno.

04:27.875 --> 04:28.876
Okay.

04:30.978 --> 04:34.782
Very little dust.

04:34.882 --> 04:36.884
40 feet. Going down at three.

04:39.820 --> 04:40.955
Stand by for touchdown.

04:41.055 --> 04:42.723
Stand by.

04:45.493 --> 04:46.727
20 feet.

04:49.497 --> 04:51.732
Going down at two. 10 feet.

04:53.834 --> 04:55.302
10 feet.

04:55.403 --> 04:56.737
And contact.

04:59.840 --> 05:02.309
Stop, push. Engine stop.

05:02.410 --> 05:06.981
Engine arm, proceed.
Command override, off.

05:07.081 --> 05:08.816
As soon as you hit the surface,

05:08.916 --> 05:13.320
the dust is gone, engine is shut down.

05:13.421 --> 05:15.823
There's no noise.

05:15.923 --> 05:18.759
You are magically in another world.

05:20.861 --> 05:23.831
It was the ultimate

05:23.931 --> 05:27.067
quiet moment in my life.

05:28.703 --> 05:31.439
Pure silence.

05:34.709 --> 05:36.777
Absolutely incredible.

05:53.060 --> 05:54.862
I spent a lot of time growing up

05:54.962 --> 05:58.866
on my grandparents' farm in Wisconsin.

05:58.966 --> 06:00.100
No electricity.

06:00.200 --> 06:03.871
No tractors, just horses.

06:03.971 --> 06:06.373
So my desire in life was

06:06.474 --> 06:09.376
to sometime have a ranch.

06:17.585 --> 06:20.988
It's where I can just be who I am.

06:32.099 --> 06:35.936
I keep thinking, "my dad
always would have loved this."

06:36.036 --> 06:38.072
He was a jack of all trades,

06:38.172 --> 06:41.175
he could fix-- rewire your
house or build you a garage,

06:41.275 --> 06:43.410
or fix the plumbing in your bathroom,

06:43.511 --> 06:45.780
and that's why I learned to
do all those things with him.

06:48.949 --> 06:50.918
He said, "I don't care
whether you're in a classroom,

06:51.018 --> 06:54.088
on a football field,
or whatever you do..."

06:54.188 --> 06:55.422
Barron?

06:55.523 --> 06:58.025
"Just do your best.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.597
And someday, I promise you.

07:02.697 --> 07:04.532
You're gonna surprise yourself."

07:07.635 --> 07:10.437
It's like coming down the L.E.M.

07:10.538 --> 07:14.542
Only if I fall here, I break my butt.

07:18.579 --> 07:21.448
1170 KCBQ, the
legendary gene cernan is with us.

07:21.549 --> 07:23.518
Now about the navy,
talk a little bit about--

07:23.618 --> 07:24.752
Because this is a big
navy town, as you know,

07:24.852 --> 07:25.953
and you spent time here.

07:26.053 --> 07:27.755
I tell ya, San Diego is--

07:27.855 --> 07:29.123
Is like another home.

07:29.223 --> 07:31.458
I spent my best years
coming out of Pensacola

07:31.559 --> 07:32.893
here in San Diego.

07:54.181 --> 07:56.784
From the time I was 22

07:56.884 --> 08:00.187
until I was 27, this was my life.

08:02.857 --> 08:05.059
In and out of San Diego,

08:05.159 --> 08:07.094
flying off aircraft carriers.

08:09.329 --> 08:12.232
This is where it all started for me.

08:28.215 --> 08:30.918
At that point, 22, 25,

08:31.018 --> 08:34.822
you're invincible
and you're bulletproof.

08:39.226 --> 08:42.196
There isn't anything you can't do,

08:42.296 --> 08:44.799
you know, risk be damned.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.210
The fact of life is,

08:56.310 --> 09:00.648
naval aviation is a risky process.

09:03.250 --> 09:06.553
You don't have much room for error.

09:06.654 --> 09:08.856
If you get sloppy,
you're gonna kill yourself.

09:21.769 --> 09:23.738
You live within that environment,

09:23.838 --> 09:26.573
you live within that culture,

09:26.674 --> 09:28.909
but you love it, and you keep doing it,

09:29.009 --> 09:30.577
and it doesn't discourage you,

09:30.678 --> 09:32.913
'cause it's not gonna happen to me.

09:33.013 --> 09:34.649
You know, it isn't gonna happen--

09:34.749 --> 09:36.250
It's always gonna
happen to the other guy.

09:36.350 --> 09:38.786
He screwed up. I'm not gonna screw up.

09:38.886 --> 09:40.688
That was the attitude you had to have.

09:44.124 --> 09:46.093
- Is that you?
- Course it is.

09:46.193 --> 09:49.129
- That is you.
- Red hot naval aviator.

09:49.229 --> 09:51.098
Invincible, invisible, and bulletproof.

09:51.198 --> 09:53.768
- Remember?
- That's a stretch.

09:55.402 --> 09:57.938
There we are. That's it.

09:58.038 --> 10:00.274
The stingers. Here we go,
up over the top.

10:00.374 --> 10:02.176
- The diamond roll.
- There it is.

10:02.276 --> 10:05.279
- God, that was fun, baldy.
- Yeah, we were flying.

10:05.379 --> 10:06.847
I made my first cruise with gene

10:06.947 --> 10:09.616
on the old U.S.S. Shangri-la.

10:09.717 --> 10:12.953
It was constant competition.

10:13.053 --> 10:15.122
Who could land better on the carrier.

10:15.222 --> 10:17.291
Who could bomb better on the carrier.

10:17.391 --> 10:19.293
We used to grab airplanes

10:19.393 --> 10:24.164
and go up and tail chase
around the clouds.

10:24.264 --> 10:27.134
We were-- we were pretty
impressed with ourselves.

10:27.234 --> 10:29.136
We have big egos.

10:29.236 --> 10:33.140
But I think you have to have a big ego

10:33.240 --> 10:36.310
to be able to do
the intense type of flying

10:36.410 --> 10:39.413
that we were trained to do.

10:39.513 --> 10:42.817
When you land a plane on a carrier

10:42.917 --> 10:44.985
in the daytime is tricky enough.

10:45.085 --> 10:46.987
But when you do it at night,

10:47.087 --> 10:48.989
you're not thinking
about your girlfriend.

10:49.089 --> 10:51.158
Well, gene might have been,
but I wasn't.

10:51.258 --> 10:53.828
I was-- I was dead serious.

10:53.928 --> 10:56.163
Now, cernan, who knows?

10:56.263 --> 10:58.933
Uh, he's kinda loose sometimes that way.

11:05.372 --> 11:07.942
Jesus. Now we got a fire.

11:10.210 --> 11:11.846
If you think back

11:11.946 --> 11:14.949
when you and I were
in 113 together, okay?

11:15.049 --> 11:17.017
We flew together all the time,

11:17.117 --> 11:19.353
but were we competitive with each other?

11:19.453 --> 11:21.155
I was a hell of a lot better
left wing man,

11:21.255 --> 11:23.190
than you were right wing man.

11:23.290 --> 11:25.860
No. No, but I was a hell of a lot
better bomber than you were.

11:25.960 --> 11:27.895
You were lucky if you
even hit the damn ground.

11:30.230 --> 11:34.201
Why were you so weak in bombing, gene?

11:34.301 --> 11:37.204
You were the weapons training officer.

11:37.304 --> 11:40.007
Baldy, it's 240,000 miles away.

11:40.107 --> 11:41.208
Anybody could hit that.

11:41.308 --> 11:44.044
And my C.E.P. Was 50 miles.

11:44.144 --> 11:46.713
You were average in bombing.

11:46.814 --> 11:49.216
You were pretty good
at getting aboard the boat.

11:49.316 --> 11:52.219
I knew you had a little fear at night.

11:52.319 --> 11:54.421
Do I have to listen to this crap?

11:54.521 --> 11:57.992
Do-- if I have to listen to this...

12:13.841 --> 12:16.076
I'm gonna make a circle over the field.

12:16.176 --> 12:19.079
But I'll come in behind you.

12:19.179 --> 12:21.281
Flying is a big part of my life.

12:23.851 --> 12:25.920
You got to have a passion,

12:26.020 --> 12:29.089
a love for what you're doing,

12:29.189 --> 12:30.858
or you shouldn't be doing it.

12:44.004 --> 12:46.273
I was an airline stewardess

12:46.373 --> 12:48.275
for continental airlines
and I lived in Los Angeles.

12:48.375 --> 12:52.112
And I was in the airport
and he was in the line.

12:52.212 --> 12:53.480
I did not remember him,

12:53.580 --> 12:55.115
but he said I smiled at him

12:55.215 --> 12:57.284
and he just thought that I was great.

12:57.384 --> 12:58.785
And I thought later--

12:58.886 --> 12:59.954
I thought what he doesn't know,

13:00.054 --> 13:01.055
I have to smile at everybody

13:01.155 --> 13:02.957
because that was part of my job.

13:06.326 --> 13:08.795
The first time he came to my house.

13:08.896 --> 13:11.966
He had a-- I think it was,
like, a '56 Chevrolet

13:12.066 --> 13:15.135
and it had kind of loud mufflers on it.

13:15.235 --> 13:16.470
I thought, "oh, my lord,

13:16.570 --> 13:18.072
he's a hot rod of some sort."

13:21.275 --> 13:23.310
She says she heard that

13:23.410 --> 13:25.145
when I pulled into the driveway.

13:25.245 --> 13:27.814
And she said, "oh, my god,
what have I gotten into?"

13:29.249 --> 13:30.951
Well...

13:49.036 --> 13:51.305
We were very much in love.

13:51.405 --> 13:53.941
He was everything
I could have asked for.

14:04.051 --> 14:06.020
And so we bought a home,

14:06.120 --> 14:07.354
and I started working.

14:07.454 --> 14:08.855
And I worked and then I worked

14:08.956 --> 14:10.357
up until I had Tracy,

14:10.457 --> 14:12.960
and that was two years
after we were married.

14:15.395 --> 14:17.031
He was great with her.

14:17.131 --> 14:18.365
He was really-- he was good,

14:18.465 --> 14:19.366
and crazy about her.

14:19.466 --> 14:21.068
He still is.

14:21.168 --> 14:23.370
That's his "punk."

14:23.470 --> 14:25.139
He calls her "punk."

14:32.079 --> 14:34.548
Man had his first
great success in space,

14:34.648 --> 14:37.217
when the Russians pushed a
man across the threshold.

14:37.317 --> 14:38.552
He was Yuri Gagarin,

14:38.652 --> 14:40.554
the astronaut the Russians lionized

14:40.654 --> 14:42.556
as the first to orbit the earth.

14:42.656 --> 14:45.159
It was the propaganda coup of the year.

14:47.561 --> 14:50.564
After the Russian flight,
U.S. plans were accelerated.

14:50.664 --> 14:52.232
Commander Alan B. Shepard

14:52.332 --> 14:53.467
was sent into suborbital flight.

14:53.567 --> 14:55.402
Unlike the Russian venture,

14:55.502 --> 14:57.237
this took place in the white hot glare

14:57.337 --> 14:59.073
of world-wide publicity.

14:59.173 --> 15:00.407
It was period of time

15:00.507 --> 15:02.242
when America needed a hero desperately,

15:02.342 --> 15:05.412
and Alan became that hero
of the astronauts.

15:05.512 --> 15:08.582
The mercury seven
were the real pathfinders

15:08.682 --> 15:10.250
of what was to happen in the future,

15:10.350 --> 15:13.587
which none of us
really fully anticipated,

15:13.687 --> 15:15.956
especially me.

15:18.192 --> 15:19.593
Many years ago,

15:19.693 --> 15:22.429
the great British explorer
George Mallory,

15:22.529 --> 15:25.432
who was to die on mount Everest,

15:25.532 --> 15:28.102
was asked why did he want to climb it.

15:28.202 --> 15:30.104
He said, "because it is there."

15:30.204 --> 15:31.271
Well, space is there.

15:31.371 --> 15:32.672
And we're going to climb it.

15:32.772 --> 15:35.442
And the moon and the planets are there.

15:35.542 --> 15:38.445
And new hopes for knowledge
and peace are there.

15:38.545 --> 15:40.947
And therefore, as we set sail,

15:41.048 --> 15:42.949
we ask god's blessing

15:43.050 --> 15:45.452
on the most hazardous, and dangerous,

15:45.552 --> 15:46.953
and greatest adventure

15:47.054 --> 15:48.622
on which man has ever embarked.

15:48.722 --> 15:50.124
Thank you.

16:20.687 --> 16:23.090
I had two reactions.

16:23.190 --> 16:24.658
The man just placed

16:24.758 --> 16:26.493
a hell of a responsibility

16:26.593 --> 16:28.562
on we in the space program,

16:28.662 --> 16:31.165
but I was pleased to hear that--

16:31.265 --> 16:33.167
Very pleased to hear that.

16:33.267 --> 16:35.001
On the other hand,

16:35.102 --> 16:38.672
if I looked at what had
to be done to get there,

16:38.772 --> 16:41.341
I thought he was crazy.

16:41.441 --> 16:43.343
We had a total of 20 minutes

16:43.443 --> 16:45.345
manned spaceflight experience.

16:45.445 --> 16:46.680
We had never been to orbit,

16:46.780 --> 16:49.583
and when were challenged
to go to the moon.

16:49.683 --> 16:52.352
And our president had the confidence

16:52.452 --> 16:54.020
to issue this challenge

16:54.121 --> 16:55.689
and he had the confidence
that we would do it.

17:24.751 --> 17:27.721
I remember he was
so enthralled with that,

17:27.820 --> 17:30.724
and I said to him, "would you
like to do something like that?"

17:30.824 --> 17:32.326
And he said, "oh, I'd love it."

17:32.426 --> 17:34.394
I'd love to do it.
Just give me the chance.

17:34.494 --> 17:36.396
But by the time I get good enough,

17:36.496 --> 17:38.232
by the time I get qualified,

17:38.332 --> 17:39.733
by the time I meet
all of their requirements,

17:39.833 --> 17:42.736
there won't be anything left to do.

17:42.836 --> 17:45.405
All the pioneering will be over.

17:45.505 --> 17:47.073
Don't ever shortchange yourself,

17:47.174 --> 17:50.277
you never ever know
what fate has in store.

17:53.180 --> 17:55.081
I got a call out of the blue

17:55.182 --> 17:58.252
that NASA was looking for new astronauts

17:58.352 --> 18:00.820
and was I interested in applying?

18:00.920 --> 18:04.090
You bet I was.

18:04.191 --> 18:06.426
I was invited to Houston,

18:06.526 --> 18:09.529
but cautioned not to speak to anybody.

18:12.299 --> 18:15.602
I jumped into a cab, drove downtown.

18:15.702 --> 18:21.275
Checked into the old rice
hotel under a fake name.

18:21.375 --> 18:23.109
It was like I just stepped

18:23.210 --> 18:26.446
into some crazy spy movie.

18:26.546 --> 18:28.615
And who did I meet in the hotel bar,

18:28.715 --> 18:30.284
but a whole bunch

18:30.384 --> 18:32.452
of the greatest test pilots
in the country

18:32.552 --> 18:35.622
all checked in under the same name--

18:35.722 --> 18:38.292
Max peck.

18:38.392 --> 18:41.795
For the next few days, they threw
mountains of paperwork at us,

18:41.895 --> 18:44.864
and asked us questions
I knew nothing about.

18:47.667 --> 18:52.806
The next step was a
physical at San Antonio.

18:52.906 --> 18:55.475
I've never been subject
to anything like that

18:55.575 --> 18:56.743
in my entire life.

18:59.346 --> 19:01.248
Every cavity in your body

19:01.348 --> 19:02.816
had something stuck into it.

19:05.419 --> 19:07.321
They put cold water in our ears

19:07.421 --> 19:10.324
and spun us around like a top.

19:10.424 --> 19:12.592
I was dizzier than a grasshopper.

19:15.362 --> 19:17.664
Then they put us in this idiot box

19:17.764 --> 19:21.335
to see how we could react
to the unknown.

19:21.435 --> 19:23.337
Up was no longer up, it was down.

19:23.437 --> 19:25.171
Red was green, green was red.

19:25.272 --> 19:27.341
Left was right.

19:27.441 --> 19:30.610
They did everything
possible to confuse us.

19:33.380 --> 19:34.681
And at the end of it all,

19:34.781 --> 19:37.851
all we were told to do was go home.

19:37.951 --> 19:41.288
"Don't call us. We'll call you."

19:42.956 --> 19:45.191
When the phone rang,
it was my future boss,

19:45.292 --> 19:46.860
Deke Slayton.

19:46.960 --> 19:49.863
He said, "geno, we've got a job for you

19:49.963 --> 19:52.799
in Houston if you still want it."

19:52.899 --> 19:57.537
And of course from that point on,

19:57.637 --> 20:01.207
my life was changed forever.

20:01.308 --> 20:04.878
I just was selected
for the space program.

20:04.978 --> 20:06.313
Wow.

20:10.584 --> 20:13.387
* zoom a little zoom in a rocket ship *

20:13.487 --> 20:16.222
* off we go on a trip

20:16.323 --> 20:18.925
* heading for the moon
at a rocket clip *

20:19.025 --> 20:20.860
* we're gonna zoom zoom

20:20.960 --> 20:21.895
* rocket

20:21.995 --> 20:23.263
* zoom a little zoom

20:23.363 --> 20:25.231
* now we're almost free

20:25.332 --> 20:27.901
* from the earth's gravity

20:28.001 --> 20:31.405
* zooming to the moon
at terrific speed... *

20:31.505 --> 20:34.308
We did all the general training going in

20:34.408 --> 20:37.010
before we ever got assigned to a flight.

20:37.110 --> 20:38.945
We had desert survival.

20:39.045 --> 20:40.580
We did a little water survival.

20:40.680 --> 20:43.350
We did jungle survival.

20:44.951 --> 20:47.321
They gave us a fishhook and a machete

20:47.421 --> 20:49.323
and dropped us in a helicopter

20:49.423 --> 20:50.790
somewhere out in the
middle of the jungle

20:50.890 --> 20:52.992
in panama.

20:53.092 --> 20:54.928
All that survival training,

20:55.028 --> 20:58.765
it teaches you something about yourself.

20:58.865 --> 21:01.668
Most of us had technical
engineering backgrounds

21:01.768 --> 21:03.303
of one kind or another,

21:03.403 --> 21:05.672
but we were starting
school all over again.

21:05.772 --> 21:09.809
Orbital mechanics, which I
knew absolutely nothing about.

21:09.909 --> 21:13.847
Geology, which I really knew
little or nothing about.

21:15.882 --> 21:21.054
We were doing something
somewhere all the time.

21:21.154 --> 21:22.589
They'd go to work in the mornings

21:22.689 --> 21:24.458
and come home late.

21:24.558 --> 21:25.825
And this was before they
were training for a mission.

21:25.925 --> 21:27.727
They were just getting their feet wet

21:27.827 --> 21:30.730
at that particular time.

21:30.830 --> 21:32.732
And we were bombarded

21:32.832 --> 21:35.869
with photographers and press,

21:35.969 --> 21:39.973
and, you know, it was like a whirlwind.

21:40.073 --> 21:41.675
It was fame.

21:41.775 --> 21:46.079
Wasn't necessarily fortune,
but it was fame,

21:46.179 --> 21:50.049
and you had to learn
how to deal with it.

21:50.149 --> 21:52.085
I mean, you walked around with--

21:52.185 --> 21:54.354
With a halo over your head.

21:54.454 --> 21:55.555
You were special.

22:33.192 --> 22:37.030
One day, they say very confidentially,

22:37.130 --> 22:39.966
we're gonna set up an appointment
for you to get fitted

22:40.066 --> 22:41.801
for a suit...

22:41.901 --> 22:43.937
For a space suit.

22:44.037 --> 22:45.071
I mean, all of a sudden.

22:45.171 --> 22:46.973
Wow.

22:49.142 --> 22:50.977
You don't know what
that's going to lead to,

22:51.077 --> 22:52.646
but you know what it means.

22:56.950 --> 22:59.052
In the fall of 1965,

22:59.152 --> 23:02.021
the Gemini 9 crew was announced.

23:02.121 --> 23:06.460
Charlie Bassett was
going to be the prime pilot

23:06.560 --> 23:08.127
with Elliot see,

23:08.227 --> 23:10.964
and Tom Stafford and I were
gonna be the backup crew.

23:13.232 --> 23:16.035
And charlie and I were
doing the same thing.

23:16.135 --> 23:18.772
We flew together.
We went places together.

23:18.872 --> 23:20.507
We trained together.

23:20.607 --> 23:22.676
We did everything together

23:22.776 --> 23:26.746
that our side of the
spacecraft had to do.

23:26.846 --> 23:28.782
So we got to be pretty good friends.

23:35.188 --> 23:40.727
And then in February of '66

23:40.827 --> 23:43.530
the totally unexpected happened.

23:54.240 --> 23:56.175
I heard this big crash.

23:56.275 --> 23:58.712
And then a few seconds
later, this big explosion,

23:58.812 --> 24:01.047
a big black cloud mushroomed up

24:01.147 --> 24:03.650
and parts from the airplane
just flew everywhere.

24:03.750 --> 24:05.151
No chance to do anything
for the two men?

24:05.251 --> 24:06.820
No. None. Not at all.

24:09.656 --> 24:10.724
Minutes after the crash,

24:10.824 --> 24:12.025
the Gemini 9 backup crew

24:12.125 --> 24:14.227
of Eugene Cernan and Thomas Stafford

24:14.327 --> 24:15.595
came in safely from Houston

24:15.695 --> 24:16.796
in a similar jet.

24:16.896 --> 24:17.931
And tonight NASA announces

24:18.031 --> 24:19.866
they now become the prime crew

24:19.966 --> 24:21.100
for the Gemini 9 flight.

24:26.005 --> 24:29.042
That was just a devastating time.

24:29.142 --> 24:32.712
It was just horrible.

24:32.812 --> 24:34.013
You just realized then I guess

24:34.113 --> 24:35.782
how close it can be.

24:39.819 --> 24:42.055
Aim.

24:42.155 --> 24:43.056
Aim.

24:43.156 --> 24:44.524
Aim.

24:49.062 --> 24:51.197
It was very traumatic at the time.

24:51.297 --> 24:53.900
But then we had a job to do,

24:54.000 --> 24:57.070
to go on and fly the mission.

24:57.170 --> 24:59.906
And we had a short period
of time to do it.

25:00.006 --> 25:02.041
I'd had a lot of experience in Gemini.

25:02.141 --> 25:05.511
Gene had no experience in Gemini.

25:05.612 --> 25:06.613
So we had to concentrate

25:06.713 --> 25:08.147
on getting him up to speed

25:08.247 --> 25:10.584
on all the procedures and techniques

25:10.684 --> 25:12.118
and the duties he had.

25:18.792 --> 25:23.563
Suddenly, after this accident,

25:23.663 --> 25:26.132
I found myself on my very first flight.

25:28.802 --> 25:32.271
This is Gemini launch control.

25:32.371 --> 25:33.773
T-minus ten...

25:33.873 --> 25:35.675
Nine... eight...

25:35.775 --> 25:37.543
Seven... six...

25:37.644 --> 25:39.212
Five... four...

25:39.312 --> 25:41.080
Three...

25:41.180 --> 25:43.583
One... zero.

25:43.683 --> 25:45.051
We have ignition.

26:33.767 --> 26:36.970
The real world's got a lot of surprises

26:37.070 --> 26:40.907
and we found a great many
of them on Gemini 9.

26:50.149 --> 26:53.052
When I stepped out of that spacecraft,

26:53.152 --> 26:55.722
we were really headed out
into the unknown.

26:59.693 --> 27:02.962
The umbilical was about 25 feet long

27:03.062 --> 27:05.131
and it was-- it was like a snake.

27:07.200 --> 27:09.168
If it brought me back to the spacecraft,

27:09.268 --> 27:11.771
I'd hit it with my foot or my arm

27:11.871 --> 27:14.140
or my helmet or whatever,

27:14.240 --> 27:17.010
and I'd go tumbling back out.

27:17.110 --> 27:19.145
I mean, I was upside down, sideways--

27:19.245 --> 27:20.914
The earth might have been up here,

27:21.014 --> 27:22.849
it might have been down there.
I don't know.

27:22.949 --> 27:26.019
I was just helpless.

27:41.334 --> 27:44.403
I'm trying to figure out what I'm doing

27:44.503 --> 27:47.941
and it isn't working.

27:48.041 --> 27:50.176
And it isn't going to go away
unless something--

27:50.276 --> 27:52.078
I do something about it,

27:52.178 --> 27:55.114
and I wasn't sure what the
next step was going to be.

28:06.826 --> 28:08.795
Once I got behind the spacecraft,

28:08.895 --> 28:12.698
the umbilical was not my problem.

28:12.799 --> 28:16.369
My task was to basically
assemble the jetpack.

28:18.237 --> 28:20.406
I had to turn oxygen valves on

28:20.506 --> 28:22.809
and fuel valves.

28:22.909 --> 28:26.880
And every time I turned them,

28:26.980 --> 28:29.215
off I would go back into space.

28:34.220 --> 28:36.489
We had no proper handholds.

28:36.589 --> 28:38.925
The foot restraints,

28:39.025 --> 28:40.393
tethers-- any of that.

28:42.896 --> 28:45.064
I was working pretty hard.

28:45.164 --> 28:48.401
My heart rate was 160, 170.

28:49.936 --> 28:52.171
I knew it. The ground knew it.

28:52.271 --> 28:55.942
I knew I was driving
the doctors bananas down there

28:56.042 --> 28:59.078
because they've never confronted
this type of thing before.

29:01.815 --> 29:04.784
Don't forget, the spacecraft
is going around the world

29:04.884 --> 29:05.985
once every 90 minutes.

29:09.122 --> 29:11.190
And the moment the sun went down,

29:11.290 --> 29:13.192
he fogged over,

29:13.292 --> 29:14.861
so he could not see.

29:25.204 --> 29:29.408
It was very frustrating
here on the ground,

29:29.508 --> 29:32.545
listening to gene and
knowing he was in trouble,

29:32.645 --> 29:36.115
but there was nothing
I could do about it.

29:36.215 --> 29:38.852
His body temperature was increasing.

29:38.952 --> 29:41.454
Deep core temperature was increasing.

29:54.467 --> 29:56.135
Okay, we have that. Roger.

29:56.235 --> 29:59.873
We concur on the no-go.

29:59.973 --> 30:04.010
It was the process
of really coming to grips

30:04.110 --> 30:06.112
for the first time

30:06.212 --> 30:07.380
that there was something

30:07.480 --> 30:10.583
about this element of space flight

30:10.683 --> 30:14.854
that we did not have
a good handle on yet.

30:14.954 --> 30:18.091
We had many lessons
to learn along the way.

30:27.500 --> 30:32.205
I was really disappointed,

30:32.305 --> 30:36.542
because I was sent up to do a job

30:36.642 --> 30:39.445
and I didn't get it done.

30:44.350 --> 30:45.919
Tom Stafford did a great job.

30:46.019 --> 30:49.122
Cernan himself did a great job,

30:49.222 --> 30:51.925
but they did have some tough moments,

30:52.025 --> 30:53.459
and we learned a lot from that.

30:55.995 --> 30:58.531
It was Cernan's failures

30:58.631 --> 31:01.367
that caused us
to eventually do it right.

31:44.610 --> 31:46.079
We moved in this house

31:46.179 --> 31:49.915
when Tracy was nine months old...

31:50.016 --> 31:54.020
In 1964.

31:54.120 --> 31:56.355
House is almost 50 years old.

31:56.455 --> 31:58.591
This neighborhood's almost 50 years old.

31:58.691 --> 32:02.261
There wasn't much here.

32:02.361 --> 32:04.530
On the corner was Mike Collins.

32:04.630 --> 32:08.367
Charlie Bassett, Al Bean
lived down the street.

32:08.467 --> 32:12.071
Rusty Schweickart lived here.

32:12.171 --> 32:14.340
That little house right there

32:14.440 --> 32:15.941
has a lot of history in the walls,

32:16.042 --> 32:17.210
if they could only talk.

32:30.456 --> 32:32.725
* here we are again

32:32.825 --> 32:35.628
* happy as can be

32:35.728 --> 32:37.130
* all good pals

32:37.230 --> 32:39.298
* and jolly good company

32:39.398 --> 32:41.067
We were all pretty close,

32:41.167 --> 32:43.636
but I think I was probably
closer to Martha Chaffee.

32:43.736 --> 32:44.970
She lived next door to me,

32:45.071 --> 32:46.205
and she and I were very close.

32:46.305 --> 32:48.507
Oh, we were always back and forth,

32:48.607 --> 32:51.477
I mean, between our houses.

32:51.577 --> 32:53.646
And we did go to the same hairdresser,

32:53.746 --> 32:55.114
and we'd have lunch,

32:55.214 --> 32:58.351
and the normal things that women do.

32:58.451 --> 33:00.019
We were like sisters.

33:00.119 --> 33:02.588
* whoops we go again

33:02.688 --> 33:03.756
* la-di-da-di-da

33:03.856 --> 33:06.592
we were already close, I think.

33:06.692 --> 33:08.694
We're all vying to be first guy

33:08.794 --> 33:11.030
to land on the moon, obviously.

33:11.130 --> 33:14.167
But we were very close
in our social activities,

33:14.267 --> 33:16.335
our training activities,

33:16.435 --> 33:20.339
and so it was a small band of brothers.

33:20.439 --> 33:22.007
* jolly good company

33:24.343 --> 33:27.413
we'd have a drink together occasionally.

33:27.513 --> 33:30.249
I won't go into any more details.

33:30.349 --> 33:32.451
* such good company

33:32.551 --> 33:34.453
* la-di-da-di-da

33:34.553 --> 33:38.224
* hey, la-di-da-di-dee

33:38.324 --> 33:41.327
I don't want to
sound like they were wild,

33:41.427 --> 33:43.562
but they were a little crazy.

33:47.233 --> 33:50.103
Oh, I don't know about
"the wild bunch" or not,

33:50.203 --> 33:51.370
but I'd like to think

33:51.470 --> 33:53.206
we worked hard and we played hard.

33:53.306 --> 33:55.341
* jolly good company, hey

33:55.441 --> 33:57.776
* jolly good company

33:57.876 --> 34:00.446
* jolly good company

34:00.546 --> 34:02.748
* jolly good company, hey

34:02.848 --> 34:04.517
* jolly good company

34:06.819 --> 34:09.155
we all got along well.

34:09.255 --> 34:11.157
We liked some people better than others,

34:11.257 --> 34:12.658
just like any group.

34:12.757 --> 34:15.228
We were all trying to do the same thing.

34:15.328 --> 34:17.730
We were willing to make sacrifices

34:17.830 --> 34:21.167
to achieve the dream
of getting to the moon.

34:21.266 --> 34:23.302
But we knew going in

34:23.402 --> 34:25.237
that some people weren't gonna make it.

34:35.181 --> 34:37.449
We do everything we possibly can

34:37.550 --> 34:39.152
to make sure that it is as safe

34:39.252 --> 34:40.786
as we can possibly make it.

34:40.886 --> 34:42.655
But one of these days,

34:42.755 --> 34:44.723
there are going to be
some mistakes made,

34:44.822 --> 34:48.427
either in the systems design
or we on the ground,

34:48.527 --> 34:50.429
which result in an accident

34:50.529 --> 34:52.364
and maybe a fatal one.

35:00.306 --> 35:01.774
We interrupt this program

35:01.874 --> 35:04.677
to bring you a special
report from ABC news.

35:04.777 --> 35:08.781
There's been a fire on the pad.

35:08.881 --> 35:11.217
What happened? They're dead.

35:15.754 --> 35:17.223
Top space agency officials

35:17.323 --> 35:19.192
are flying to cape Kennedy tonight

35:19.292 --> 35:20.659
to begin the official investigation

35:20.759 --> 35:22.595
into what caused the flash fire

35:22.695 --> 35:24.763
that killed the nation's first
three Apollo astronauts

35:24.863 --> 35:26.131
earlier tonight.

35:26.232 --> 35:29.235
Lieutenant colonel Gus Grissom, 42;

35:29.335 --> 35:31.370
Lieutenant colonel ed white, 36;

35:31.470 --> 35:34.139
And lieutenant commander
roger Chaffee, 31;

35:34.240 --> 35:35.774
All died in moments,

35:35.874 --> 35:38.411
helplessly trapped
inside their spacecraft.

35:44.550 --> 35:49.322
I was sitting
at that console right there

35:49.422 --> 35:53.659
when Grissom, Chaffee,
and white were killed.

35:53.759 --> 35:55.861
I listened to them die.

36:04.403 --> 36:08.341
That evening, January 27th, a Friday,

36:08.441 --> 36:12.945
I was giving my kids hot dogs...

36:13.045 --> 36:15.914
And then somebody said
there'd been an accident.

36:18.384 --> 36:22.421
So when Mike Collins finally came...

36:22.521 --> 36:26.759
To the door and I saw him, I knew.

36:26.859 --> 36:27.860
I knew already.

36:27.960 --> 36:32.965
I said, "I know, mike, but...

36:33.065 --> 36:34.433
You've got to tell me."

36:36.269 --> 36:37.870
And he did.

36:37.970 --> 36:41.540
And I took my children into the--

36:44.543 --> 36:46.312
I'm sorry.

36:48.381 --> 36:50.949
I took my children into the bedroom,

36:51.049 --> 36:53.218
and trying to tell...

36:55.788 --> 36:58.824
An eight-year-old and a five-year-old

36:58.924 --> 37:01.360
that they're dad wasn't coming home,

37:01.460 --> 37:02.895
it's hard.

37:07.065 --> 37:09.735
And I went home and...

37:09.835 --> 37:11.003
Pulled in my driveway,

37:11.103 --> 37:12.338
still in the flight suit.

37:12.438 --> 37:13.772
Cars all over the street.

37:16.942 --> 37:19.845
NASA security around.

37:19.945 --> 37:22.348
Walked right across the lawn

37:22.448 --> 37:23.782
to Martha's house.

37:27.520 --> 37:30.589
I dreaded--

37:30.689 --> 37:32.791
I dreaded the moment.

37:52.110 --> 37:53.612
Arlington.

37:53.712 --> 37:58.351
Cold January day.

37:58.451 --> 38:01.587
I wasn't sure whether we were
burying three of our colleagues

38:01.687 --> 38:05.290
or whether we were burying
the entire Apollo program.

38:13.499 --> 38:15.934
Because we knew the Chaffees so well,

38:16.034 --> 38:20.939
I was asked to stay with Martha.

38:21.039 --> 38:24.042
And I did.

38:24.142 --> 38:27.813
Sat next to her at the cemetery.

38:27.913 --> 38:30.716
How she held her composure,

38:30.816 --> 38:32.050
I don't know.

38:53.038 --> 38:54.807
Good-bye, my friend.

39:11.624 --> 39:14.092
The Apollo 1 fire changed us forever...

39:15.694 --> 39:18.931
And we've never forgotten it.

39:19.031 --> 39:21.800
In our business of space flight,

39:21.900 --> 39:24.470
risk is the price of progress.

40:02.575 --> 40:04.443
* and the sign said

40:04.543 --> 40:06.512
* long-haired freaky people *

40:06.612 --> 40:09.047
* need not apply...

40:09.147 --> 40:10.916
The world was in a mess,

40:11.016 --> 40:13.952
the country was in a mess,

40:14.052 --> 40:18.423
but this was going on
out there somewhere.

40:18.524 --> 40:20.092
Maybe we were a little cocoon

40:20.192 --> 40:21.927
in the middle of this big world of ours.

40:22.027 --> 40:25.631
* so I took off my hat
and said imagine that... *

40:25.731 --> 40:28.867
You know, we had a mission to do--

40:28.967 --> 40:30.903
Astronauts, engineers,

40:31.003 --> 40:33.639
all sorts of people working for NASA,

40:33.739 --> 40:35.874
all working towards the same goal.

40:35.974 --> 40:41.547
* can't you read the sign

40:46.552 --> 40:49.555
Man, I was working my butt off,

40:49.655 --> 40:51.990
and I never really appreciated

40:52.090 --> 40:54.927
what was going on at home.

40:55.027 --> 40:58.096
I think the wives
played an important part

40:58.196 --> 41:00.966
because we did everything
when they weren't there,

41:01.066 --> 41:03.602
which they weren't there
most of the time.

41:03.702 --> 41:04.970
I think he'd be the first to tell you

41:05.070 --> 41:07.005
that I pulled my share of the load.

41:09.074 --> 41:11.243
They'd been home
taking care of the kids.

41:11.343 --> 41:12.711
Paying the bills,

41:12.811 --> 41:14.212
seeing the kids get to school

41:14.312 --> 41:16.949
and do their homework.

41:17.049 --> 41:21.253
We were unfair. We were selfish.

41:21.353 --> 41:23.922
We were not very good husbands.

41:24.022 --> 41:26.759
We weren't very good fathers either.

41:26.859 --> 41:29.194
And sometimes you can't balance things

41:29.294 --> 41:31.029
like work and family.

41:31.129 --> 41:34.567
Like, we had-- this is how the work is

41:34.667 --> 41:36.702
and the family is way down here.

41:36.802 --> 41:38.136
If you didn't do this,

41:38.236 --> 41:40.806
you weren't gonna stay as an astronaut.

41:40.906 --> 41:42.140
That's simple.

41:42.240 --> 41:44.042
We weren't interested in this.

41:44.142 --> 41:46.044
We were interested in this.

42:20.879 --> 42:22.147
We're gonna be the second flight

42:22.247 --> 42:25.283
to ever go to the moon--

42:25.383 --> 42:28.020
Stafford, young, and myself.

42:28.120 --> 42:32.190
We're gonna get on a big ol' Saturn V.

42:32.290 --> 42:34.727
It was a big chunk to swallow.

42:36.762 --> 42:37.930
You're sitting on the top

42:38.030 --> 42:41.767
of 2,740 tons of equivalent TNT.

42:41.867 --> 42:45.003
Do you know fear or apprehension?

42:45.103 --> 42:48.306
I didn't before you told me
it was that much TNT.

43:10.195 --> 43:12.197
The last couple of days before launch

43:12.297 --> 43:14.700
get pretty intense.

43:17.903 --> 43:19.905
It is a very personal time,

43:20.005 --> 43:22.941
and it was a very loving time.

43:23.041 --> 43:25.711
You realize that unless god's willing,

43:25.811 --> 43:27.680
I might not ever see you again,

43:27.780 --> 43:31.249
or he might not see us again.

43:31.349 --> 43:33.051
What if doesn't come back?

43:39.124 --> 43:40.726
The night before I flew,

43:40.826 --> 43:44.329
I wrote a letter to Tracy just in case.

43:49.968 --> 43:54.239
"To my dar-- darling daughter, Tracy.

43:54.339 --> 43:59.311
Trace, you're almost
too young to understand

43:59.411 --> 44:04.116
what it means to have your
daddy go to the moon.

44:04.216 --> 44:05.918
But someday,

44:06.018 --> 44:09.221
you'll have the feeling
of excitement and pride

44:09.321 --> 44:11.656
that mommy and daddy do.

44:11.757 --> 44:15.694
Punk, we have lots of camping

44:15.794 --> 44:20.432
and horseback riding to do
when I get back.

44:20.532 --> 44:22.901
I want you to look at the moon,

44:23.001 --> 44:25.403
because when you are reading this,

44:25.503 --> 44:30.075
daddy is almost there.

44:30.175 --> 44:32.010
I love you Tracy.

44:32.110 --> 44:35.147
My wonderful...

44:35.247 --> 44:37.816
And beautiful daughter.

44:37.916 --> 44:39.084
All my love."

44:55.367 --> 44:56.802
You don't sleep that well,

44:56.902 --> 44:59.772
you get up fairly early in the morning.

44:59.872 --> 45:01.874
You have your traditional breakfast.

45:09.081 --> 45:10.482
Then you go down and get suited up.

45:13.518 --> 45:16.288
You've been suited up
a thousand times before

45:16.388 --> 45:20.292
for all kinds of tests
and what have you.

45:20.392 --> 45:22.127
This is for real.

45:33.105 --> 45:36.341
The worst part of it all
is just waiting.

45:45.183 --> 45:48.420
And then at last it's-- it's time to go.

45:52.825 --> 45:54.827
Your adrenaline is pumping pretty strong

45:54.927 --> 45:56.328
at that point in time.

46:00.098 --> 46:03.501
You know, you can hear yourself
breathe inside that suit.

46:18.150 --> 46:21.219
T-minus 33 minutes and 30 seconds.

46:21.319 --> 46:25.190
33 minutes until the scheduled
liftoff of Apollo 10.

46:25.290 --> 46:26.558
This Saturn V, by the way,

46:26.658 --> 46:29.327
is the most powerful
Saturn V ever to fly,

46:29.427 --> 46:34.032
with 7,700,000 pounds
of first stage power...

46:34.132 --> 46:35.133
Two minutes and counting.

46:35.233 --> 46:36.969
Our status board indicates

46:37.069 --> 46:39.071
here in the control room...

46:42.540 --> 46:45.844
It's no longer
something you're gonna do.

46:45.944 --> 46:49.147
It's something that's happening.

46:49.247 --> 46:55.153
It's happening right now to you.

47:28.620 --> 47:31.523
Everything intensifies.

47:33.658 --> 47:35.527
...Seconds and counting.

47:35.627 --> 47:38.931
We are go for our mission
to the moon at this time...

47:40.698 --> 47:43.035
But the clock keeps going.

47:45.137 --> 47:47.205
All systems are performing
satisfactorily.

47:47.305 --> 47:52.144
All the last minute countdown
checks are proceeding okay.

47:55.080 --> 47:57.315
This is it. This is for real.

48:00.085 --> 48:01.553
That thing's gonna light off under you

48:01.653 --> 48:03.621
and you're gonna
head on out to the moon.

48:05.657 --> 48:08.093
15... 14...

48:08.193 --> 48:10.662
13... 12... 11...

48:10.762 --> 48:12.397
Ten... nine...

48:12.497 --> 48:15.900
We have ignition sequence start.

48:16.001 --> 48:17.669
And five... four...

48:17.769 --> 48:19.671
Three... two...

48:19.771 --> 48:22.274
All engines running.

48:22.374 --> 48:24.309
Launch, commence liftoff.

48:24.409 --> 48:28.013
We have liftoff,
49 minutes past the hour.

48:46.031 --> 48:47.199
You're go staging 10.

48:47.299 --> 48:49.567
Roger. 10 is go.

48:49.667 --> 48:51.203
Inboard shutdown.

49:07.685 --> 49:11.123
What a ride. What a ride.

49:11.223 --> 49:14.259
That's gene
cernan reporting, "what a ride."

49:41.119 --> 49:42.687
It was America
that was going to the moon,

49:42.787 --> 49:46.524
but the fact of life,
it was 20th century humanity

49:46.624 --> 49:47.659
that was going to the moon.

49:47.759 --> 49:49.661
The entire world was on board

49:49.761 --> 49:51.296
that spacecraft with us.

49:53.565 --> 49:58.136
- Station point one.
- Roger.

49:58.236 --> 50:00.172
Looking good intermediate zone.

50:11.749 --> 50:15.620
Apollo 10, Houston, do you read?

50:15.720 --> 50:18.756
Roger.

50:18.856 --> 50:21.593
10, you're go for pyro arm
and go for sep.

50:21.693 --> 50:24.162
Roger.

50:26.531 --> 50:27.765
We have sep.

50:31.303 --> 50:33.671
The world is incredible.

50:33.771 --> 50:36.308
I sure hope we can show
it to you, I really do.

50:40.112 --> 50:44.349
You're part of this
big thing that's going on,

50:44.449 --> 50:46.384
and yet you don't realize

50:46.484 --> 50:48.286
how big a thing it is, quite frankly.

50:50.422 --> 50:53.125
You don't fully comprehend it all.

51:14.546 --> 51:18.450
10, Houston, 22 looks good to us.

51:18.550 --> 51:21.519
I gotta check the thrusters here now.

51:31.163 --> 51:34.098
You look out the window,

51:34.199 --> 51:36.701
your whole window
is filled up with the earth.

51:38.903 --> 51:40.838
How's that for the front porch?

51:40.938 --> 51:42.340
Oh, boy, that's beautiful.

51:50.415 --> 51:51.849
10, it's looking real stable to us.

51:51.949 --> 51:53.718
We show you closing slightly.

51:56.888 --> 52:01.226
Charlie, we can't be
more than about 5, 10 feet away.

52:01.326 --> 52:02.660
Roger.

52:09.767 --> 52:11.303
Snap, snap, and we're there.

52:11.403 --> 52:14.206
- Got two grays.
- Roger.

52:25.483 --> 52:28.553
You capture that lunar module

52:28.653 --> 52:30.555
and we're on our way.

52:35.593 --> 52:41.199
You now regain consciousness
as to where you are

52:41.299 --> 52:42.767
and where you're going.

52:49.474 --> 52:52.744
ABC news presents
the flight of Apollo 10,

52:52.844 --> 52:54.712
brought to you by tang,

52:54.812 --> 52:55.913
the energy breakfast drink

52:56.013 --> 52:58.916
for astronauts in outer space.

52:59.016 --> 53:01.953
Good morning or good evening,

53:02.053 --> 53:04.456
depending on where
you are in the country.

53:04.556 --> 53:07.359
From ABC space headquarters
in new york...

53:07.459 --> 53:08.593
I guess, after one mission

53:08.693 --> 53:11.195
you feel a little bit more confident,

53:11.296 --> 53:12.364
because you think, "oh, well,

53:12.464 --> 53:13.865
I've been there, done that.

53:13.965 --> 53:15.367
So maybe I'll be better this time.

53:15.467 --> 53:17.269
I'll do-- I know kind of
what to expect."

53:17.369 --> 53:19.537
You had all these people in your home.

53:19.637 --> 53:22.707
You had all these press out there.

53:22.807 --> 53:24.742
It's trying, believe me.

53:24.842 --> 53:27.612
It's very, very trying.

53:27.712 --> 53:29.814
You do sweat it out till they're home.

53:32.417 --> 53:34.552
Apollo 10 is reported to be maneuvering

53:34.652 --> 53:37.455
to burn attitude at this time.

53:37.555 --> 53:42.727
Its distance from the moon
is 681 nautical miles.

53:42.827 --> 53:46.531
Apollo 10, Houston.
Two minutes to L.O.S.

53:46.631 --> 53:50.568
Everybody here says godspeed.

53:50.668 --> 53:51.736
Okay, we'll see them

53:51.836 --> 53:53.438
right on the other side in orbit.

53:55.973 --> 53:57.842
We wouldn't see
the moon until we got there.

53:59.444 --> 54:00.412
And finally, we got close.

54:00.512 --> 54:01.646
We could finally see

54:01.746 --> 54:04.248
a little scimitar of the moon,

54:04.349 --> 54:05.517
that was all.

54:07.485 --> 54:11.723
And then the sun went and disappeared.

54:15.760 --> 54:18.730
The moon is between you and the sun,

54:18.830 --> 54:22.300
and it blocks out that light.

54:22.400 --> 54:26.704
You are now immersed,
yourself, in this blackness.

54:29.073 --> 54:32.009
And then all of a sudden...

54:32.109 --> 54:34.779
Boom...

54:34.879 --> 54:37.715
Someone turns on the lights.

54:37.815 --> 54:40.017
There's the moon.

54:41.586 --> 54:43.888
Roger, Houston, Apollo 10.

54:43.988 --> 54:46.724
You can tell the world
that we have arrived.

54:49.694 --> 54:52.430
As you come out,
you're still in sunlight.

54:52.530 --> 54:55.967
You come around the horizon of the moon,

54:56.067 --> 54:57.702
and here comes the earth.

54:59.904 --> 55:01.873
Earth rise.

55:04.141 --> 55:05.710
Charlie, it might sound corny,

55:05.810 --> 55:07.679
but the view is really
out of this world.

55:14.786 --> 55:16.954
Charlie brown and snoopy.
You're going over the hill.

55:17.054 --> 55:18.456
All the systems are go.

55:18.556 --> 55:20.024
We're all go here on the ground.

55:20.124 --> 55:22.460
It's looking great. Over.

55:26.498 --> 55:30.602
Roger. 56, 22, 55. Snoopy going.

55:33.004 --> 55:36.408
We is go, and we is
down among them, charlie.

55:36.508 --> 55:38.543
Roger. I hear you
weaving your way up the freeway.

55:38.643 --> 55:40.878
Can you give me
a post-burn report? Over.

55:43.915 --> 55:46.518
Yeah, as soon as I get my breath.

55:54.592 --> 55:56.494
As we circled the moon

55:56.594 --> 55:58.463
in a lunar lander-- snoopy--

56:00.965 --> 56:02.900
We knew we were vulnerable

56:03.000 --> 56:05.036
to a whole host of unknown problems.

56:08.172 --> 56:12.910
And our goal was to identify
and then solve those problems

56:13.010 --> 56:14.879
so that Neil and his crew would have

56:14.979 --> 56:17.381
just that much less to worry about.

56:19.617 --> 56:22.487
And one of the problems we encountered

56:22.587 --> 56:25.457
was pilot induced.

56:29.694 --> 56:33.665
We were going to simulate
from 47,000 feet,

56:33.765 --> 56:35.399
as if we were on the moon,

56:35.500 --> 56:37.735
lift off from the assent stage,

56:37.835 --> 56:41.506
and then go up into a rendezvous
mode with the mother ship.

56:42.907 --> 56:44.909
But in preparing to do so,

56:45.009 --> 56:47.912
tom and I misplaced a switch,

56:48.012 --> 56:49.413
Snoop, Houston,

56:49.514 --> 56:52.717
we have you go for staging. Over.

56:52.817 --> 56:54.018
Okay, tom.

56:57.622 --> 56:59.023
What's that?

56:59.123 --> 57:00.725
Okay, let's...

57:00.825 --> 57:04.095
god damn.

57:04.195 --> 57:05.897
Son of a bitch.

57:05.997 --> 57:08.466
We're in trouble.

57:08.566 --> 57:11.536
I saw that lunar horizon go by my window

57:11.636 --> 57:14.171
eight times in some 15 seconds.

57:16.641 --> 57:17.609
Snoop, Houston...

57:23.080 --> 57:25.883
The thing spun around at max rate

57:25.983 --> 57:27.719
to this new attitude.

57:27.819 --> 57:30.454
That got our attention
in mission control.

57:30.555 --> 57:33.558
And we got-- certainly got his attention

57:33.658 --> 57:36.994
as he relayed it over the--
Over the comm.

57:39.063 --> 57:43.835
Tom got this rotation stopped.

57:43.935 --> 57:45.469
How we did it,

57:45.570 --> 57:47.605
I don't know.

57:47.705 --> 57:50.508
Yeah, okay. Something
went wild there on that staging.

57:50.608 --> 57:52.009
We're all set. We didn't lock it.

57:52.109 --> 57:54.011
We're going ahead to the auto maneuver.

57:58.249 --> 57:59.784
It was frightening when they did have

57:59.884 --> 58:01.185
that one mishap.

58:03.320 --> 58:07.091
If you think going to the moon is hard,

58:07.191 --> 58:09.093
you ought to try staying home.

58:16.868 --> 58:21.005
Apollo 10 really came
home in a blaze of glory.

58:21.105 --> 58:24.208
Rolling, twisting, turning--

58:24.308 --> 58:30.214
These flecks of fire
were just snapping at us.

58:30.314 --> 58:31.849
We're on our backs coming in backwards.

58:31.949 --> 58:33.250
The heat shield's behind us.

58:33.350 --> 58:35.920
It would just come over
the top of my window,

58:36.020 --> 58:37.188
and just come over there

58:37.288 --> 58:40.524
right in front of my eyes and snap.

58:40.625 --> 58:44.528
A sheet of fire completely
immerses you and surrounds you.

58:51.068 --> 58:55.006
I know what it's like to be that comet.

58:55.106 --> 58:57.675
The shooting star.

58:57.775 --> 59:01.579
It is a spectacular fireworks show.

59:01.679 --> 59:03.881
It--

59:03.981 --> 59:06.283
I wish it had happened
on fourth of July.

59:36.948 --> 59:39.350
We had just been to the moon.

59:39.450 --> 59:43.921
So you can imagine
how it felt to come home.

59:45.122 --> 59:46.924
Home. Your real home.

59:47.024 --> 59:48.059
Not just your home away from--

59:48.159 --> 59:51.228
This home. Your family.

59:51.328 --> 59:53.998
And the response of people

59:54.098 --> 59:56.901
you have known a lifetime

59:57.001 --> 59:59.270
was so overwhelming.

59:59.370 --> 01:00:02.273
You could tell it meant
something to them.

01:00:03.908 --> 01:00:05.309
Nothing but pride.

01:00:05.409 --> 01:00:07.712
Nothing but pride.

01:00:07.812 --> 01:00:09.747
And so proud of him,

01:00:09.847 --> 01:00:11.716
so proud of him that he could go out

01:00:11.816 --> 01:00:13.951
and do something like that.

01:00:16.087 --> 01:00:17.321
And proud of the country.

01:00:35.172 --> 01:00:39.110
Not many people remember Apollo 10,

01:00:39.210 --> 01:00:40.845
but I do.

01:00:40.945 --> 01:00:42.847
And I'll tell you someone else
who remembered it,

01:00:42.947 --> 01:00:44.148
and that's Neil Armstrong.

01:00:44.248 --> 01:00:46.684
Okay, Neil,

01:00:46.784 --> 01:00:50.387
we can see you coming
down the ladder now.

01:00:50.487 --> 01:00:52.757
I'm gonna step off the lander now.

01:00:56.994 --> 01:01:00.431
That's one small step for man,

01:01:00.531 --> 01:01:03.935
one giant leap for mankind.

01:01:07.972 --> 01:01:12.176
Would I have liked to been
at a first landing?

01:01:12.276 --> 01:01:13.410
You bet your life I would've.

01:01:15.947 --> 01:01:17.348
But as it turned out,

01:01:17.448 --> 01:01:20.284
I think fate shined down upon us,

01:01:20.384 --> 01:01:22.686
and got the right people

01:01:22.787 --> 01:01:23.888
in the right place at the right time.

01:01:39.303 --> 01:01:41.773
How does one,

01:01:41.873 --> 01:01:46.778
adequately express his feelings

01:01:46.878 --> 01:01:50.181
about a special friend

01:01:50.281 --> 01:01:55.820
when that friend is also a world icon

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:59.723
whose name will live
in history long after

01:01:59.824 --> 01:02:03.394
all here today have been forgotten.

01:02:05.162 --> 01:02:09.400
Neil, you can now finally

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.969
put out your hands

01:02:12.069 --> 01:02:15.840
and touch the face of god.

01:02:16.941 --> 01:02:19.743
Farewell, my friend.

01:02:19.844 --> 01:02:23.480
You have left us far too soon.

01:02:25.282 --> 01:02:26.851
God bless you, Neil.

01:03:16.033 --> 01:03:18.135
Oh!

01:03:18.235 --> 01:03:20.504
Hey, daddy.

01:03:20.604 --> 01:03:22.306
How are you?

01:03:40.357 --> 01:03:43.260
- Okay, here.
- Come here, baby.

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:45.296
- Remember when I came back from--
- Mm-hmm.

01:03:45.396 --> 01:03:47.564
Apollo 10 and I tried to impress you?

01:03:47.664 --> 01:03:50.134
- Yeah.
- You know, daddy's been to the moon.

01:03:50.234 --> 01:03:52.569
- Been here, done this.
- He flew snoopy closer,

01:03:52.669 --> 01:03:55.439
and was way out in the--

01:03:55.539 --> 01:03:57.408
In-- in the heavens where god lives.

01:03:57.508 --> 01:03:59.977
And I never will forget it,

01:04:00.077 --> 01:04:02.246
you just stood, and listened to me.

01:04:02.346 --> 01:04:03.414
I brought you back down to earth.

01:04:03.514 --> 01:04:05.917
All the sudden, it got quiet

01:04:06.017 --> 01:04:07.184
and I had nothing else to say,

01:04:07.284 --> 01:04:09.486
and you looked up, and said,

01:04:09.586 --> 01:04:13.057
"daddy, now that you've been
to the moon and back,

01:04:13.157 --> 01:04:15.526
- when you gonna take me camping...
- Camping.

01:04:15.626 --> 01:04:17.328
- We used to go camping.
- ...Like you promised me."

01:04:17.428 --> 01:04:18.562
That's right.

01:04:18.662 --> 01:04:20.898
And you know what that brought home?

01:04:20.998 --> 01:04:23.400
All the times,

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:26.203
during that period of our lives together

01:04:26.303 --> 01:04:28.005
that I couldn't take you camping,

01:04:28.105 --> 01:04:29.006
that I was gone.

01:04:29.106 --> 01:04:30.307
I was gone somewhere.

01:04:30.407 --> 01:04:33.544
I was gone and gone, and gone and gone.

01:04:33.644 --> 01:04:38.349
It was a very selfish life on my part,

01:04:38.449 --> 01:04:40.985
and on the part of all the guys.

01:05:06.443 --> 01:05:08.545
The rim on this little crater

01:05:08.645 --> 01:05:10.081
seems to be all white.

01:05:13.450 --> 01:05:16.988
This is gonna be some
kind of different ride.

01:05:41.012 --> 01:05:46.450
Dick Gordon
had a crew with Jack Schmitt.

01:05:46.550 --> 01:05:49.320
Jack Schmitt was a lunar geologist.

01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:51.288
It made sense, at least to me,

01:05:51.388 --> 01:05:52.956
and I was afraid it made a lot of sense

01:05:53.057 --> 01:05:54.625
to too many other people,

01:05:54.725 --> 01:05:57.161
that they should keep
that crew together.

01:05:57.261 --> 01:05:59.997
Well, the national academy of sciences

01:06:00.097 --> 01:06:02.133
wanted a geologist to fly to the moon.

01:06:02.233 --> 01:06:03.500
They've always wanted that.

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:06.303
So here's their last opportunity

01:06:06.403 --> 01:06:11.042
to put a ph.D. Geologist
on a flight crew.

01:06:11.142 --> 01:06:12.476
And so it was gonna come down

01:06:12.576 --> 01:06:15.979
to dick's crew or my crew,

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:17.281
and he had an ace in a hole.

01:06:17.381 --> 01:06:20.684
He had jack Schmitt.

01:06:20.784 --> 01:06:24.288
I knew if I had any chance at all,

01:06:24.388 --> 01:06:27.358
I'd better not do something stupid.

01:06:31.128 --> 01:06:33.064
We do a lot of training in simulators,

01:06:33.164 --> 01:06:36.167
and we had this lunar
landing training vehicle.

01:06:38.202 --> 01:06:40.604
We also used the helicopter.

01:06:45.442 --> 01:06:47.611
I had an urge to fly low

01:06:47.711 --> 01:06:49.746
over the Indian river,

01:06:49.846 --> 01:06:54.251
and the little skid that you
land on with this helicopter

01:06:54.351 --> 01:06:55.452
touched the water.

01:07:03.827 --> 01:07:07.431
This is the helmet that I was wearing

01:07:07.531 --> 01:07:09.066
when I was flying that helicopter,

01:07:09.166 --> 01:07:11.602
and when I unstrapped it,

01:07:11.702 --> 01:07:13.270
it floated to the surface,

01:07:13.370 --> 01:07:17.408
and it picked an equilibrium position.

01:07:17.508 --> 01:07:20.144
Probably floated,
I guess about like that,

01:07:20.244 --> 01:07:25.249
and everything above the
surface is charcoal.

01:07:25.349 --> 01:07:29.653
I thought he'd, as the
saying goes in the navy,

01:07:29.753 --> 01:07:31.788
that he'd screwed the pooch.

01:07:31.888 --> 01:07:34.358
I thought he'd done it to himself,

01:07:34.458 --> 01:07:36.093
because, you know, hell,

01:07:36.193 --> 01:07:38.629
nobody flies a damn
helicopter into the water

01:07:38.729 --> 01:07:41.598
unless there's a couple bikinis
there you're looking at.

01:07:43.434 --> 01:07:46.703
How can anyone do something

01:07:46.803 --> 01:07:50.174
so dumb as I just did

01:07:50.274 --> 01:07:52.576
and be given the responsibility

01:07:52.676 --> 01:07:57.848
of flying a gillion-dollar
spacecraft to the moon--

01:07:57.948 --> 01:08:00.151
Being responsible for the crew,

01:08:00.251 --> 01:08:02.853
the safety, the success of the mission?

01:08:02.953 --> 01:08:05.356
And I knew, absolutely,

01:08:05.456 --> 01:08:09.193
when the time came, it would not be me.

01:08:09.293 --> 01:08:10.561
Scene four, take one.

01:08:10.661 --> 01:08:14.331
Sound for Apollo 17 astronaut cernan.

01:08:16.466 --> 01:08:18.769
Gene Cernan, Harrison
Schmitt, and Ronald Evans

01:08:18.868 --> 01:08:22.139
have been named for the finish
Apollo flight, Apollo 17.

01:08:22.238 --> 01:08:24.640
Schmitt is a first
among flying astronauts.

01:08:24.741 --> 01:08:27.344
He's primarily a geologist
rather than a pilot.

01:08:29.946 --> 01:08:32.549
When we made the final
selection of the crew

01:08:32.649 --> 01:08:35.551
for Apollo 17,

01:08:35.652 --> 01:08:38.689
that was done in concert
with Deke Slayton,

01:08:38.788 --> 01:08:40.122
who was head of the flight crew

01:08:40.224 --> 01:08:41.524
operations at the time.

01:08:41.625 --> 01:08:44.328
And I was never too pleased
with the process

01:08:44.428 --> 01:08:46.330
that was followed there,

01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:48.131
because I thought it was too much

01:08:48.232 --> 01:08:50.767
in the hands of Mr. Slayton.

01:08:52.603 --> 01:08:54.537
Jack was taken off of my crew

01:08:54.638 --> 01:08:58.341
and assigned to Apollo 17.

01:09:00.344 --> 01:09:03.413
I didn't think that was very fair.

01:09:03.514 --> 01:09:06.450
And I said, "they can't take
jack Schmitt off my crew

01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:09.252
and give him to somebody else."

01:09:09.353 --> 01:09:11.622
He may have had a
right to be somewhat bitter

01:09:11.721 --> 01:09:14.225
I got the flight and he didn't.

01:09:14.325 --> 01:09:16.227
And, uh, you know, he said--

01:09:16.327 --> 01:09:17.661
Tells me that today,

01:09:17.761 --> 01:09:21.665
because he said, "you took my flight."

01:09:21.765 --> 01:09:23.300
And I may have.

01:09:53.529 --> 01:09:55.866
You know, sitting on a pad

01:09:55.966 --> 01:09:57.868
waiting for launch,

01:09:57.968 --> 01:10:01.238
it's a long time to-- to contemplate

01:10:01.338 --> 01:10:02.973
where you've come from,

01:10:03.073 --> 01:10:04.475
where you're going.

01:10:06.810 --> 01:10:09.713
It's one of those real moments

01:10:09.813 --> 01:10:12.716
that you take an introspective look

01:10:12.816 --> 01:10:15.986
at what is now in front of you.

01:10:18.422 --> 01:10:20.357
This is what I asked for.

01:10:20.457 --> 01:10:25.362
This was my personal
moment of reckoning.

01:10:55.459 --> 01:10:56.993
When it lifted off,

01:10:57.093 --> 01:11:01.598
it was just-- I mean,
I'll never, ever, forget

01:11:01.698 --> 01:11:05.769
how that was because the whole
ground rumbled underneath your feet

01:11:05.869 --> 01:11:09.806
and all the fish jumped out of the lake.

01:11:15.612 --> 01:11:19.883
The entire sky just totally lit up.

01:11:23.119 --> 01:11:26.022
It was just beautiful.

01:12:03.827 --> 01:12:05.829
Oh, my golly!

01:12:05.929 --> 01:12:08.365
Unbelievable.

01:12:08.465 --> 01:12:09.433
Unbelievable,

01:12:09.533 --> 01:12:10.567
but it is bright in the sun.

01:12:13.103 --> 01:12:16.507
It was the most proud moment

01:12:16.607 --> 01:12:18.775
of my entire life.

01:12:21.578 --> 01:12:26.650
I had proved to myself
that I was capable

01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:27.984
of coming this far.

01:12:32.188 --> 01:12:35.826
I couldn't get out of my mind--

01:12:35.926 --> 01:12:40.096
This almost science fiction world

01:12:40.196 --> 01:12:41.832
I was living in.

01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:47.738
Now we had a little more than three days

01:12:47.838 --> 01:12:50.607
to make use of the time
we had on the moon,

01:12:50.707 --> 01:12:54.110
and that's when the work really began.

01:13:01.818 --> 01:13:04.955
So we set experiments out there,

01:13:05.055 --> 01:13:06.156
seismic experiments,

01:13:06.256 --> 01:13:09.059
experiments of all kinds.

01:13:11.094 --> 01:13:14.998
The next thing we did
was unload the lunar rover.

01:13:18.935 --> 01:13:21.872
We had the rover to facilitate
our ability to move around,

01:13:21.972 --> 01:13:25.476
and try to explore this entire valley.

01:13:25.576 --> 01:13:27.911
We never would have been able
to do that on foot.

01:13:29.112 --> 01:13:30.747
It didn't go very fast,

01:13:30.847 --> 01:13:35.185
but it went fast enough
on the moon in 1/6 gravity.

01:13:35.285 --> 01:13:36.520
Okay, and gene, you might get the--

01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:37.988
Okay, now shove it.

01:13:38.088 --> 01:13:39.690
That's too much. Wait a minute.

01:13:41.825 --> 01:13:46.997
But our major objective
was to try and establish

01:13:47.097 --> 01:13:48.431
the history of that valley.

01:13:48.532 --> 01:13:52.936
- Oh, hey! Wait a minute.
- What?

01:13:53.036 --> 01:13:55.706
There is orange soil!

01:13:55.806 --> 01:13:57.207
Well, don't move it until I see it.

01:13:58.809 --> 01:14:00.811
It's all over.

01:14:00.911 --> 01:14:02.078
Orange!

01:14:02.178 --> 01:14:03.680
Don't move it until I see it.

01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:07.117
I've stirred it up with my feet.

01:14:07.217 --> 01:14:08.819
How can there be orange
soil on the moon?

01:14:10.053 --> 01:14:11.755
Look at it.

01:14:13.123 --> 01:14:14.791
I'll be a son of a--

01:14:14.891 --> 01:14:17.728
That's the volcanic...

01:14:20.831 --> 01:14:22.799
...they're up against
a constraint anyways,

01:14:22.899 --> 01:14:25.969
so they gotta leave at a certain
time regardless of what we got.

01:14:26.069 --> 01:14:28.471
I'm willing to give up
all the light mantle stuff,

01:14:28.572 --> 01:14:29.906
and stay up another--

01:14:30.006 --> 01:14:31.542
That's the priority right up there, huh?

01:14:31.642 --> 01:14:33.043
There it is. Look at that.

01:14:34.745 --> 01:14:37.814
That change at all?

01:14:37.914 --> 01:14:40.517
Oh, thank you, geno.
It looks much better.

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:46.256
When you get out there and look back...

01:14:48.692 --> 01:14:52.028
As small as it is compared to the earth,

01:14:52.128 --> 01:14:54.064
when you're the only two guys out there,

01:14:54.164 --> 01:14:57.500
it can be pretty lonely at times.

01:15:01.905 --> 01:15:05.208
Once we got in, we took our suits off

01:15:05.308 --> 01:15:08.779
and we had to dry them out.

01:15:08.879 --> 01:15:10.881
We had to eat.

01:15:10.981 --> 01:15:12.115
We had to rest.

01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:17.220
I remember specifically
pulling up the shade

01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:19.756
before we tried to get some rest

01:15:19.856 --> 01:15:23.159
and looking out at the earth.

01:15:25.028 --> 01:15:27.964
Maybe I just had to make
sure it was still there.

01:15:35.839 --> 01:15:38.742
Oh, that ought to be a beautiful shot

01:15:38.842 --> 01:15:40.644
if I can see what my settings are.

01:15:51.955 --> 01:15:56.226
That whole period of time,
that's the time I call

01:15:56.326 --> 01:15:58.795
sitting on god's front porch.

01:16:05.201 --> 01:16:09.572
I was out there somewhere
with the opportunity

01:16:09.673 --> 01:16:12.242
to see something and be somewhere

01:16:12.342 --> 01:16:17.047
and do something
that only 12 human beings

01:16:17.147 --> 01:16:20.216
in the history of mankind

01:16:20.316 --> 01:16:22.185
have been able to do, or be, or see.

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:32.829
Tracy, did he promise to
bring you anything back?

01:16:32.929 --> 01:16:36.166
Well, I asked him to bring
a rock back from the moon.

01:16:36.266 --> 01:16:37.968
But he said if he could,

01:16:38.068 --> 01:16:39.803
he'd bring me one back.

01:16:39.903 --> 01:16:42.673
And he said if he could,
he'd bring me a moonbeam.

01:16:42.773 --> 01:16:44.641
- A what?
- A moonbeam.

01:16:44.741 --> 01:16:46.777
A moonbeam?

01:16:48.111 --> 01:16:49.079
He's either pulling your leg

01:16:49.179 --> 01:16:50.747
or you're pulling mine.

01:16:50.847 --> 01:16:52.148
That's what he said.

01:17:06.963 --> 01:17:08.799
I parked the rover

01:17:08.899 --> 01:17:12.302
about 3/4 of a mile behind the L.E.M.

01:17:12.402 --> 01:17:14.104
So that they could operate
the television camera

01:17:14.204 --> 01:17:16.172
and watch our liftoff.

01:17:18.008 --> 01:17:19.810
And I don't know
what possessed me to do it,

01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:25.248
I just scratched Tracy’s
initials in the lunar surface.

01:17:26.817 --> 01:17:28.118
I put "T.D.C."

01:17:30.286 --> 01:17:33.356
And someday, sometime,

01:17:33.456 --> 01:17:34.991
I can only believe--

01:17:35.091 --> 01:17:36.659
Not just hope, but believe--

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:38.661
That someone will go back,

01:17:38.762 --> 01:17:40.096
and that's what they'll find.

01:17:45.902 --> 01:17:48.271
I guess you appreciate
things the older you get.

01:17:48.371 --> 01:17:50.373
Always.

01:17:50.473 --> 01:17:52.843
You understand them better,
you appreciate them more.

01:17:52.943 --> 01:17:54.945
And you know, the older I get,

01:17:55.045 --> 01:18:00.016
probably the more
meaningful it gets to me.

01:18:00.116 --> 01:18:02.352
I'm gonna roll it
downhill so we can work on it,

01:18:02.452 --> 01:18:04.420
well, I'll document it first.

01:18:06.890 --> 01:18:09.025
Walking up the ladder,

01:18:09.125 --> 01:18:11.361
was probably one of the most
memorable moments for me,

01:18:11.461 --> 01:18:15.065
because I looked down at my footprints

01:18:15.165 --> 01:18:18.869
and I knew I wasn't
coming this way again.

01:18:18.969 --> 01:18:21.972
Why we were here? What did it mean?

01:18:22.072 --> 01:18:25.041
I looked over my shoulder,
and there's the earth,

01:18:25.141 --> 01:18:27.410
there's reality. There's home.

01:18:30.546 --> 01:18:34.951
I wanted to press the freeze button.

01:18:35.051 --> 01:18:37.821
I wanted to stop time.

01:18:37.921 --> 01:18:40.456
I really wanted to reach out,

01:18:40.556 --> 01:18:44.027
put it in my hand,
stick it in my spacesuit,

01:18:44.127 --> 01:18:47.063
and bring it home
and show it to everybody.

01:18:49.465 --> 01:18:52.502
This is what it feels like.
This is what it looks like.

01:18:59.843 --> 01:19:04.815
This is Apollo control
and 187 hours, 31 minutes.

01:19:04.915 --> 01:19:09.786
Now approaching 30 minutes
until time for lunar liftoff.

01:19:09.886 --> 01:19:13.189
The countdown toward liftoff
going very smoothly.

01:19:13.289 --> 01:19:16.927
Control, telmu, G.N.C, eecomm,

01:19:17.027 --> 01:19:19.229
surgeon, inco.

01:19:19.329 --> 01:19:21.431
I was the flight director
on this console

01:19:21.531 --> 01:19:25.335
for gene Cernan's liftoff from the moon.

01:19:25.435 --> 01:19:28.338
Rog. We're go for liftoff here, capcom.

01:19:28.438 --> 01:19:30.240
So that when it came time,

01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:33.810
we recognized the triumph of
the work that we had done,

01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:37.047
but we also lost some very good friends.

01:19:37.147 --> 01:19:40.884
So it was a celebratory mood,

01:19:40.984 --> 01:19:44.520
but it was also one that we
looked very somberly at our past.

01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:49.125
And we hoped that somewhere,
somehow, someday,

01:19:49.225 --> 01:19:52.095
we would be able to carry the
work that we had been doing

01:19:52.195 --> 01:19:53.496
into the future.

01:19:53.596 --> 01:19:57.467
Three, two, one, ignition.

01:19:57.567 --> 01:19:59.903
Burn away, Houston.

01:20:50.686 --> 01:20:56.259
Could I have imagined
that it would come to this?

01:21:08.104 --> 01:21:10.040
I don't want to remember it this way.

01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:11.441
I'm just disappointed.

01:21:11.541 --> 01:21:13.977
I almost wish I didn't come here today.

01:21:31.527 --> 01:21:35.231
You go to the moon
and you're everybody's hero.

01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:39.369
You're sort of caught up in it yourself.

01:21:44.374 --> 01:21:47.443
People everywhere of every
color, of every religion,

01:21:47.543 --> 01:21:50.413
every ethnic background
were overwhelmed.

01:21:50.513 --> 01:21:52.348
"Let me touch you. Let me talk to you."

01:21:53.749 --> 01:21:57.553
And you live that kind of activity

01:21:57.653 --> 01:21:59.455
for four or five years,

01:21:59.555 --> 01:22:01.024
that's a big change in your life.

01:22:05.395 --> 01:22:08.431
Our life did change a lot.

01:22:08.531 --> 01:22:11.934
He was so engrossed
in all of this notoriety,

01:22:12.035 --> 01:22:15.605
and traveling, and speaking,

01:22:15.705 --> 01:22:18.975
and I got so tired of it.

01:22:19.075 --> 01:22:21.277
And I thought,
"I just want a normal life.

01:22:21.377 --> 01:22:23.679
I want to be a normal housewife."

01:22:28.651 --> 01:22:33.123
And I remember when gene and I
were on a private jet,

01:22:33.223 --> 01:22:34.457
I was sitting in one aisle,

01:22:34.557 --> 01:22:36.292
he was sitting across the aisle from me.

01:22:36.392 --> 01:22:38.294
And I looked at him, and I thought,

01:22:38.394 --> 01:22:42.298
"you know, cernan, this is your
life, this is what you want.

01:22:42.398 --> 01:22:44.067
But I don't want it."

01:22:47.670 --> 01:22:49.639
I guess a couple years after that

01:22:49.739 --> 01:22:52.308
we ended up separating,

01:22:52.408 --> 01:22:55.211
and going our different ways.

01:23:01.751 --> 01:23:05.655
Some 60% of us got divorced,

01:23:05.755 --> 01:23:07.690
and I'm not proud of it.

01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:09.059
We were so tunnel-visioned

01:23:09.159 --> 01:23:10.326
when we were going to the moon,

01:23:10.426 --> 01:23:12.162
that we never had time to get off

01:23:12.262 --> 01:23:15.165
that big white horse we were riding

01:23:15.265 --> 01:23:16.699
until it was too late.

01:23:20.070 --> 01:23:22.738
I lived a single life for, I don't know,

01:23:22.838 --> 01:23:25.007
seven or eight years.

01:23:25.108 --> 01:23:26.342
And that sounds like a lot of fun

01:23:26.442 --> 01:23:29.112
when you're 40, 50 years old.

01:23:31.547 --> 01:23:35.718
But sooner or later, you've gotta
come to grips with who you are

01:23:35.818 --> 01:23:37.753
and what's important in life.

01:23:43.493 --> 01:23:45.528
I was invited to a friend's home

01:23:45.628 --> 01:23:47.697
for a cocktail party,

01:23:47.797 --> 01:23:52.034
and gene happened to be there.

01:23:52.135 --> 01:23:54.204
And I just happened to see
the best looking chick

01:23:54.304 --> 01:23:55.705
at the party, and it was her,

01:23:55.805 --> 01:23:57.207
and someone said,
"would you take her home?"

01:23:57.307 --> 01:23:59.209
And I said, "well, I'd be glad to."

01:23:59.309 --> 01:24:01.043
But after taking her home,

01:24:01.144 --> 01:24:03.045
I'm not sure I was ever
gonna see her again.

01:24:03.146 --> 01:24:06.149
That's true.

01:24:06.249 --> 01:24:08.050
I just liked gene's--

01:24:08.151 --> 01:24:10.320
I thought he was more down to earth

01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:12.222
than a lot of the other ones.

01:24:12.322 --> 01:24:14.224
Mm-hmm.

01:24:14.324 --> 01:24:16.559
And at that time, I didn't
think he had such a big ego.

01:24:16.659 --> 01:24:20.563
- Give me a break.
- But I have since--

01:24:20.663 --> 01:24:22.798
I'm learning more about me.

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:27.103
Give me a break.

01:24:27.203 --> 01:24:29.739
You know we're gonna be
married 25 years?

01:24:29.839 --> 01:24:32.575
- 24.
- Five.

01:24:32.675 --> 01:24:33.509
It's five.

01:24:41.617 --> 01:24:45.588
Jan became something
very special in my life.

01:24:45.688 --> 01:24:47.089
And from that relationship,

01:24:47.190 --> 01:24:51.694
came a family again, and grand kids.

01:24:53.729 --> 01:24:55.498
Kids.

01:24:55.598 --> 01:24:58.100
- Give me a break.
- Take a seat. Come on.

01:24:58.201 --> 01:24:59.435
This is a beautiful--

01:24:59.535 --> 01:25:01.103
Someone take a picture.

01:25:01.204 --> 01:25:04.274
We are! Sit down, come on.

01:25:04.374 --> 01:25:05.541
- Okay.
- Fix your hair.

01:25:05.641 --> 01:25:07.810
- Ow.
- You're about to sit on me?

01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:09.812
Ow. That's-- you put me in the middle.

01:25:09.912 --> 01:25:10.846
Wait. You're sitting on me.

01:25:10.946 --> 01:25:12.448
Ow, my shirt.

01:25:12.548 --> 01:25:14.116
- Okay, am I all right?
- Yes.

01:25:14.217 --> 01:25:15.185
Okay.

01:25:21.391 --> 01:25:24.394
...1.6 billion dollars.

01:25:24.494 --> 01:25:27.197
I'm here for a couple days and
I'm going to San Diego,

01:25:27.297 --> 01:25:29.299
so I could do something...

01:25:29.399 --> 01:25:31.634
Oh, brother.

01:25:31.734 --> 01:25:33.803
It's a very high energy level.

01:25:33.903 --> 01:25:37.139
He-- you know, he just doesn't stop.

01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:40.643
He doesn't take a moment
to catch his breath.

01:25:40.743 --> 01:25:44.814
He's got a million things
on his mind at one time.

01:25:44.914 --> 01:25:49.285
I don't know that retirement
is really in his vocabulary.

01:25:49.385 --> 01:25:51.654
And there are people here
that are listening today

01:25:51.754 --> 01:25:54.590
who will see humans walk on mars.

01:25:54.690 --> 01:25:55.891
I won't, but they will.

01:25:58.861 --> 01:26:01.831
While we're still here,

01:26:01.931 --> 01:26:03.833
and there's an opportunity to share

01:26:03.933 --> 01:26:06.168
what the space program has meant,

01:26:06.269 --> 01:26:07.837
particularly in this day and age

01:26:07.937 --> 01:26:10.206
when we're talking to a generation

01:26:10.306 --> 01:26:12.608
who weren't even around
when we went to the moon,

01:26:12.708 --> 01:26:15.411
we have an obligation to do that.

01:26:15.511 --> 01:26:17.613
Okay. We get it?

01:26:19.349 --> 01:26:20.516
You came all the way from France?

01:26:20.616 --> 01:26:21.451
Yes.

01:26:23.018 --> 01:26:24.854
Oh, boy.

01:26:24.954 --> 01:26:26.922
Oh, yeah. That's a good one.

01:26:28.023 --> 01:26:29.325
Thank you. Thank you.

01:26:29.425 --> 01:26:30.493
Take care.

01:26:31.594 --> 01:26:33.396
Whew!

01:26:33.496 --> 01:26:35.765
All of the fame, and the speeches,

01:26:35.865 --> 01:26:38.701
- and the traveling...
- What's your name?

01:26:38.801 --> 01:26:43.373
I'm on him a lot now.
"Gene, shut it down."

01:26:43.473 --> 01:26:44.940
Shut down your schedule.

01:26:46.809 --> 01:26:48.378
This is October.

01:26:48.478 --> 01:26:52.882
Here was September. Here was august.

01:26:52.982 --> 01:26:56.552
Throttle back, you know?
Slow down, baby.

01:26:56.652 --> 01:26:59.389
You gotta smell the roses a little bit.

01:26:59.489 --> 01:27:00.756
But he drives himself.

01:27:11.767 --> 01:27:14.404
The bad part about it is,

01:27:14.504 --> 01:27:15.738
I'm realizing that,

01:27:15.838 --> 01:27:17.740
like when we were in the space program,

01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:20.242
when we're going full bar,
eight days a week,

01:27:20.343 --> 01:27:22.412
I ignored my family.

01:27:22.512 --> 01:27:25.581
We-- we all did.

01:27:25.681 --> 01:27:28.584
But I'm finding I'm getting
innuendos from my family,

01:27:28.684 --> 01:27:31.421
from the grand kids, from my wife,

01:27:31.521 --> 01:27:34.256
that I'm doing the same thing now.

01:27:34.357 --> 01:27:38.594
And maybe--

01:27:38.694 --> 01:27:42.765
Maybe I'm finally
coming to a realization

01:27:42.865 --> 01:27:44.600
that I gotta think of somebody else.

01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:46.769
I do. I-- I don't think I'm selfish.

01:27:46.869 --> 01:27:48.604
I think I do think of somebody else.

01:27:48.704 --> 01:27:51.273
I think of those people
who want a piece of you,

01:27:51.374 --> 01:27:53.776
who you somehow owe a piece to,

01:27:53.876 --> 01:27:55.445
but there is a limit.

01:27:55.545 --> 01:27:57.880
Now I think maybe I owe
a piece of me to my family.

01:28:08.491 --> 01:28:10.893
- You got-- okay.
- Here you go.

01:28:13.729 --> 01:28:15.297
You know, this is a lot of work

01:28:15.398 --> 01:28:17.032
- for old guys like us.
- Tell me about it.

01:28:26.676 --> 01:28:29.979
These two horses together
can go like the wind.

01:28:30.079 --> 01:28:32.982
We ain't gonna do that today.

01:28:33.082 --> 01:28:34.917
I know damn well I'm not.

01:28:38.988 --> 01:28:41.323
You fly right wing, I'll fly left wing.

01:28:41.424 --> 01:28:42.425
Okay.

01:29:00.876 --> 01:29:02.612
We're gonna go across

01:29:02.712 --> 01:29:04.346
and go back in through that gate.

01:29:04.447 --> 01:29:06.348
- Okay.
- Unless you want to run the barrel?

01:29:06.449 --> 01:29:11.020
No. I don't want to run any barrels.

01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:13.523
Hey, baldy, are you ready to admit

01:29:13.623 --> 01:29:15.090
we ain't got what we used to got?

01:29:16.726 --> 01:29:18.561
Yeah.

01:29:25.435 --> 01:29:29.705
Easy, now. Let's not have a wreck here.

01:29:29.805 --> 01:29:31.373
I got it. I'll get it.

01:29:31.474 --> 01:29:34.710
If I can get my leg
over this saddle, anyway.

01:29:34.810 --> 01:29:35.878
There.

01:29:35.978 --> 01:29:37.379
All right, I think we survived.

01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:40.115
Come on. Oh, shit.

01:29:43.919 --> 01:29:46.722
Oh, baldy! I can't walk!

01:29:46.822 --> 01:29:47.990
I can't either.

01:29:52.595 --> 01:29:55.130
We're still here.

01:29:55.230 --> 01:29:56.899
- That's right.
- How many more years?

01:29:56.999 --> 01:29:59.068
We got a pact to make it to 85

01:29:59.168 --> 01:30:01.070
and then we'll reevaluate.

01:30:01.170 --> 01:30:03.906
I gotta pact-- I gotta pact with my dog.

01:30:04.006 --> 01:30:06.576
You know what? When we got him, I said,

01:30:06.676 --> 01:30:08.410
"if you go ten, I'll go ten."

01:30:08.511 --> 01:30:09.745
That was Barron,

01:30:09.845 --> 01:30:11.413
and I've gotta renegotiate with him.

01:30:11.514 --> 01:30:13.749
We only got three and a half
of those ten years left.

01:30:13.849 --> 01:30:16.919
- I'm not ready!
- Well, bless.

01:30:17.019 --> 01:30:19.021
- I love you, babe.
- I love you, too, man.

01:30:49.819 --> 01:30:52.955
Just standing here,

01:30:53.055 --> 01:30:54.123
getting a little nostalgic.

01:30:54.223 --> 01:30:56.125
Sort of gives me a chance

01:30:56.225 --> 01:30:59.795
to wonder whether
this all happened in my life.

01:30:59.895 --> 01:31:00.963
Whether it was a reality

01:31:01.063 --> 01:31:06.802
or whether it was a dream.

01:31:06.902 --> 01:31:12.141
Is that dummy in there
with my name on really me?

01:31:15.077 --> 01:31:17.913
And I also stand here and I'm wondering

01:31:18.013 --> 01:31:20.149
what people are gonna think,

01:31:20.249 --> 01:31:23.152
not in another 40 years,
but maybe another 100 years.

01:31:23.252 --> 01:31:25.921
Who knows? Maybe another 1,000 years.

01:31:52.014 --> 01:31:53.515
I often tell young kids,

01:31:53.616 --> 01:31:58.020
and particularly my grand kids,

01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:00.856
don't ever count yourself out.

01:32:00.956 --> 01:32:03.959
You'll never know how good
you are unless you try.

01:32:06.629 --> 01:32:07.863
Dream the impossible,

01:32:07.963 --> 01:32:10.966
and go out and make it happen.

01:32:13.235 --> 01:32:14.970
I walked on the moon.

01:32:17.072 --> 01:32:19.141
What can't you do?

01:35:37.397 --> 01:35:41.318
And, as we leave the Moon
at Taurus-Littrow,

01:35:42.108 --> 01:35:46.865
we leave as we came and God
willing, as we shall return,

01:35:47.239 --> 01:35:52.205
with peace and hope for all mankind.
