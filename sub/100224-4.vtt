00:17.142 --> 00:20.771
Family. The word is a forecast.

00:20.854 --> 00:25.359
The family you're born into
forecasts who you'll be, where you go,

00:25.901 --> 00:28.987
but membership comes with an obligation.

00:29.071 --> 00:32.866
Your success
becomes your family's success,

00:33.367 --> 00:34.952
as do your failures.

00:35.369 --> 00:38.664
But what do we owe those
that share our blood?

00:39.498 --> 00:43.001
Is it more than what we owe
a stranger on the street?

00:43.085 --> 00:46.463
Is there a point
where a line can be drawn?

00:46.547 --> 00:52.427
A point at which we're clear to protect
ourselves at the expense of our families?

00:53.303 --> 00:59.518
Did Owen Cave find himself
on the other side of that line?

01:03.397 --> 01:07.109
Hey. How you doing, Uncle Bug?

01:08.777 --> 01:09.945
Here you go.

01:13.448 --> 01:15.784
Smell like they got lots to say.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.706
-You get all the ones on my list?
-Yeah.

01:20.789 --> 01:21.790
Thank you.

01:28.297 --> 01:29.798
This one smell different.

01:32.384 --> 01:34.386
I ran over to Walden Pond.

01:34.469 --> 01:37.264
Had to buy it used.
It was checked out at the library.

01:37.347 --> 01:39.683
You always been slick, Pop-Tart.

01:40.684 --> 01:42.728
This one smells like commerce.
Take it back.

01:44.021 --> 01:45.439
What you listening to?

01:47.024 --> 01:48.025
You.

01:49.234 --> 01:51.486
You got a voice make people pay attention.

01:51.570 --> 01:52.779
Like your mama.

01:56.909 --> 01:59.786
I was thinking about going up to
the cemetery to see her.

01:59.870 --> 02:01.830
-Wanna come with me?
-Nope.

02:01.914 --> 02:05.584
We could get some flowers, ride up there
before they even close the gates.

02:06.418 --> 02:08.461
You used to do that when you was little.

02:08.877 --> 02:09.922
What?

02:10.714 --> 02:14.092
Run to your mama every time
you crossed swords with Shreve.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.179
You heard about that already?

02:17.596 --> 02:20.516
Bush telegram.
More reliable than the government.

02:21.725 --> 02:23.602
-What you gonna do about it?
-Me?

02:24.186 --> 02:25.187
What's he gonna do?

02:25.646 --> 02:26.772
Nothing.

02:27.773 --> 02:33.904
When Shreve look at you, he don't see
your pretty smile, your big, pretty eyes.

02:34.404 --> 02:39.076
Can't see his daughter.
All he sees is... his mistakes.

02:39.701 --> 02:42.579
He doesn't think about all that.
It's been 30 years.

02:44.373 --> 02:47.292
Man went to prison
the week after your mama died.

02:48.085 --> 02:50.754
Left you swinging in the wind.

02:51.171 --> 02:54.007
He ain't forgot. Trust me. It eats at him.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.492
Took a chance I'd find you here.

04:46.328 --> 04:47.913
You gotta stop, Lanie.

04:48.664 --> 04:50.874
You cannot keep ambushing me like this.

04:50.958 --> 04:54.086
Were you really just gonna slip in and out
without saying anything?

04:54.169 --> 04:56.421
I'm not here for you.

04:57.422 --> 05:00.467
Do you not understand that?
Did you really need me to say it?

05:01.176 --> 05:05.222
Wait. Wait. Why do you think
that she made you executor?

05:05.305 --> 05:07.641
I think we both know
the answer to that question.

05:07.724 --> 05:11.395
Because I think that she did it
to make sure that you would come home.

05:11.478 --> 05:12.479
At least once.

05:12.563 --> 05:17.651
I just don't wanna fight, Lanie.
God, I don't want any of this.

05:17.734 --> 05:18.735
Well, too bad.

05:18.819 --> 05:22.239
I loved her as much as you did,
and she loved me.

05:22.656 --> 05:23.907
-I know that.
-Do you?

05:23.991 --> 05:26.660
Do you know that I was
in the car with her when she died?

05:26.743 --> 05:27.995
I don't wanna hear this.

05:28.078 --> 05:30.998
We were hanging there upside down,
and they were trying to get us out.

05:31.081 --> 05:34.626
It felt like hours and hours,
but they said it was only 18 minutes.

05:34.710 --> 05:37.504
-Knock it off.
-And I watched her fade,

05:37.588 --> 05:39.256
and then she just...

05:40.924 --> 05:41.925
died.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.387
The lights went out right in front of me.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.390
I do this for a living.

05:48.682 --> 05:52.603
I help people transition,
and I'm known for my touch,

05:52.686 --> 05:56.773
so how cruel is it
that I was trapped there by my seat belt,

05:56.857 --> 05:59.943
and she's hanging, dying?

06:00.027 --> 06:03.739
I'm close, so close I can feel the heat
coming off of her body,

06:03.822 --> 06:07.034
but I cannot make contact with her,
no matter what I try--

06:07.117 --> 06:09.077
-Jesus, Lanie.
-She was trying to say something,

06:09.161 --> 06:10.662
but her mouth was filling up with blood,

06:10.746 --> 06:12.748
so I have no idea
what she was trying to say.

06:13.749 --> 06:16.376
Do I not deserve to say goodbye to her?

06:16.835 --> 06:20.339
Don't I deserve to be...
part of the arrangements?

06:20.422 --> 06:23.217
I'm the one who stayed here, not you.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.454
Lanie, get off of her!

07:05.509 --> 07:06.885
I'm sorry.

07:08.637 --> 07:10.639
This is who we are together.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.394
This is who we've always been together.

07:18.146 --> 07:23.777
When we're done with Susan,
I am gone, Lanie.

07:31.159 --> 07:35.038
When a woman cheats on her husband
and her lover is found murdered,

07:35.497 --> 07:39.042
naturally the first person you would
look at is the woman's husband.

07:39.918 --> 07:46.008
In this story, that woman is Melanie Cave,
and the husband is Owen Cave.

07:47.176 --> 07:50.721
He had motive in its purest form.

07:52.014 --> 07:54.725
But motive alone doesn't make a murderer.

07:55.309 --> 08:00.189
As strong as his motive was,
his alibi was even stronger.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.649
Or so we thought.

08:04.026 --> 08:09.114
Owen Cave, a police officer, detective,
was on duty that night.

08:09.656 --> 08:13.660
The question of whether he could've
done it should've started and ended there.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.079
According to police logs,

08:16.163 --> 08:20.792
Owen Cave responded
to a noise complaint at 3:30 a.m.

08:21.293 --> 08:23.337
After leaving the noise complaint,

08:23.420 --> 08:27.299
Owen was unaccounted for
until the next entry on the police log,

08:27.382 --> 08:30.719
a domestic violence call at 4:44 a.m.

08:31.803 --> 08:33.514
In those 74 minutes,

08:33.597 --> 08:38.769
Owen Cave could've left his patrol
and doubled back to the Buhrman house.

08:38.852 --> 08:44.733
Perhaps wanting to confront Chuck Buhrman,
a man he once called "friend."

08:45.150 --> 08:48.654
A man he knew
had been sleeping with his wife.

08:50.405 --> 08:53.116
Did Owen Cave kill Chuck Buhrman?

08:54.493 --> 08:56.745
Only two men knew the answer.

08:57.579 --> 09:00.499
Owen's partner, George Hutner,
was one of them,

09:00.582 --> 09:04.044
and he took his knowledge to the grave.

09:05.671 --> 09:09.049
Owen is the only other person
privy to the truth.

09:09.132 --> 09:13.095
And I believe his son Warren
deserves to hear it.

09:15.180 --> 09:18.058
Come on. Get up. Jax, get up.

09:19.101 --> 09:20.561
Come on, you lazy shit.

09:21.436 --> 09:24.356
Hey, hey, hey. Watch your tone with him.

09:24.439 --> 09:26.900
Hey. Miss me? Huh?

09:27.317 --> 09:29.111
Come on, Jax. Sit. Sit.

09:29.528 --> 09:32.656
Welcome back, homes.
Nice to see you not dead.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.826
Yeah. Nice to not be dead.

09:36.326 --> 09:40.372
They put me in charge after you left.
Ain't so bad at the top.

09:41.999 --> 09:43.125
Don't get attached...

09:45.210 --> 09:46.420
to the dogs.

09:47.713 --> 09:49.798
They come and go. They're not ours.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.009
Come on, Jax. Sit. Sit.

09:53.635 --> 09:54.720
We're straight, right?

10:00.809 --> 10:02.227
Who tried to take me out?

10:02.853 --> 10:04.062
You hear anything?

10:04.146 --> 10:05.147
Nah.

10:07.149 --> 10:08.567
But I'll keep my ears up.

10:09.776 --> 10:10.903
All right.

10:12.029 --> 10:13.238
Not for free though.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.451
Ain't easy to listen and not be seen.

10:19.077 --> 10:20.412
I'll take care of you.

10:23.373 --> 10:27.211
I need to talk to the two witnesses
who made those 911 calls.

10:27.294 --> 10:30.422
See if they noticed anything off
about Owen.

10:30.714 --> 10:34.134
He had more than enough time to get to
the Buhrman house between calls.

10:34.218 --> 10:37.095
-You need to slow it down, Poppy.
-You don't think he's hiding something?

10:37.179 --> 10:40.474
I don't know. He probably is.
That doesn't mean he murdered old boy.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.476
Cops do all kind of shit on patrol.

10:42.559 --> 10:43.602
Is that a confession?

10:43.685 --> 10:47.898
I'm just saying, Chuck had a lot of fans.
Quite a few of them on the crazy side.

10:48.398 --> 10:49.399
Sounds thin.

10:49.733 --> 10:51.443
And then there's your boy, Warren.

10:51.527 --> 10:54.905
I know it doesn't fit the script for you,
but he still looks good to me.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.240
All right.

10:56.323 --> 10:59.117
If I concede some of your what-ifs...

10:59.952 --> 11:02.871
will you concede
that those 74 minutes are sketchy?

11:02.955 --> 11:04.873
-Yes.
-That simple?

11:04.957 --> 11:07.000
Hey, I'm not a complicated cat.

11:07.084 --> 11:10.712
Then I guess you won't mind
riding along to talk to these witnesses.

11:10.796 --> 11:13.549
It would be helpful
to have a former policeman there.

11:13.632 --> 11:16.301
All right then. I'll pick you up tonight.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.237
What? Y'all beefing?

11:35.320 --> 11:36.822
Keep your eyes on the road.

11:38.657 --> 11:42.202
Classic Poppy.
If you don't wanna see it, it ain't there.

11:43.579 --> 11:45.622
But Desiree's as bad as you.

11:46.248 --> 11:47.708
You don't know what you're talking about.

11:47.791 --> 11:50.294
Please.
I see your people more than you do.

11:51.420 --> 11:53.422
You know how she acted when we broke up?

11:54.006 --> 11:57.134
You skipped town. I had to stay here
and deal with the heat.

11:57.759 --> 12:01.346
Is that why you got married a year later?

12:02.806 --> 12:05.893
Hey, when I jump, I jump.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.770
But we both see
how that turned out, right?

12:11.148 --> 12:12.649
How old is your daughter now?

12:13.400 --> 12:16.945
Trini's 15. Smartest person I know.

12:17.613 --> 12:18.822
Besides you.

12:19.990 --> 12:23.619
She wants to take this road trip
to go look at colleges.

12:23.702 --> 12:28.498
And I'm telling you, Pop, she has planned
this thing out to the letter.

12:28.957 --> 12:33.504
She worked out driving times.
Flights. Even where we're staying.

12:35.172 --> 12:36.173
But...

12:38.175 --> 12:39.968
-What?
-Her moms.

12:41.303 --> 12:42.638
She won't okay the trip.

12:44.890 --> 12:46.517
It's messing with me, you know?

12:49.853 --> 12:52.105
I just don't feel like fighting
with her anymore.

12:54.107 --> 12:57.486
You should always feel like fighting.
For your daughter.

13:12.709 --> 13:13.961
Kara Rios?

13:15.712 --> 13:16.839
Yes?

13:17.339 --> 13:20.801
My name is Poppy Parnell.
I'm a journalist. This is my associate.

13:20.884 --> 13:22.511
Markus Killebrew.

13:22.594 --> 13:23.637
This gonna take long?

13:23.720 --> 13:24.930
Oh, we'll be quick.

13:25.430 --> 13:30.060
We're just trying to find out
everything we can about this man.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.564
We think he answered
a 911 call at your apartment.

13:33.647 --> 13:35.649
Halloween night. 1999.

13:37.818 --> 13:39.319
He wasn't wearing a uniform.

13:39.820 --> 13:42.364
-Owen Cave?
-I don't remember his name.

13:42.948 --> 13:45.742
-I do remember he ditched me though.
-He ditched you?

13:45.826 --> 13:48.704
He wasn't there for more than two minutes,
and then he got a phone call.

13:48.787 --> 13:50.539
-He took off once his phone rang?
-Yeah.

13:50.956 --> 13:52.791
Seemed pissed about it too.

13:53.208 --> 13:55.210
He grabbed his partner and left.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.212
Forgot all about me.

14:00.716 --> 14:01.717
Thank you so much.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.093
Appreciate it. Thank you.

14:06.638 --> 14:10.309
Susan Carver will be dearly missed.
She was the heart of our little school.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.353
Ella. Stay where I can see you.

14:13.437 --> 14:15.063
Such a warm spirit.

14:15.731 --> 14:20.777
And a special talent
for making everyone feel heard and seen.

14:21.695 --> 14:24.072
When I arrived at Crown Academy,

14:24.156 --> 14:26.366
Susan had already been here
for about seven years,

14:26.450 --> 14:28.660
but she immediately brought me
into the fold.

14:28.744 --> 14:31.663
I'm grateful that I got the chance
to know her.

14:33.123 --> 14:37.419
I'm grateful that you all got the chance
to spend time with her.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.840
I know it will be hard
to go throughout each day without her.

14:41.924 --> 14:43.383
You brought your daughter?

14:43.884 --> 14:46.678
-This little spot can be a place where...
-Whatever it takes.

14:46.762 --> 14:49.932
...we can all go in those moments
when we're missing her the most.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.100
There's two of you.

14:53.435 --> 14:54.770
Who are you?

14:55.312 --> 14:59.858
I am Josie. I'm your mommy's sister.

15:02.027 --> 15:03.320
Who are you?

15:03.403 --> 15:04.905
I'm Ella Josephine.

15:13.747 --> 15:17.167
Hi. So nice to meet you, Ella Josephine.

15:17.251 --> 15:19.336
Can you say,
"Nice to meet you, Aunt Josie"?

15:19.419 --> 15:21.255
Nice to meet you, Aunt Josie.

15:25.759 --> 15:26.760
You're married?

15:29.137 --> 15:30.514
-No.
-It was a life well lived.

15:31.265 --> 15:33.475
-May we all follow your example.
-Any kids?

15:33.851 --> 15:35.561
You will never be forgotten.

15:35.644 --> 15:36.645
No.

15:38.605 --> 15:41.441
Ms. Carver's class
would like to sing a song in her honor

15:41.525 --> 15:43.193
before we plant the tree.

15:43.861 --> 15:47.447
I'd like to ask Susan's family to
step forward so that we can get started.

15:49.241 --> 15:50.325
You coming?

15:52.536 --> 15:53.537
Mom's been calling.

15:53.620 --> 15:57.332
She's got the whole world in her hands

15:57.416 --> 16:00.002
-She's got the whole world...
-Girls! Time to come in.

16:02.421 --> 16:03.881
No, Lanie, you can't leave!

16:04.631 --> 16:06.550
Warren! Let me go!

16:12.931 --> 16:15.434
Josie? Aunt Josie?

16:16.101 --> 16:18.520
-She's got the wind and the rain
-Aunt Josie?

16:18.604 --> 16:19.605
In her hands

16:19.980 --> 16:22.232
Can you come to dinner at our house?

16:23.942 --> 16:27.738
She's got the wind and the rain
In her hands

16:27.821 --> 16:28.822
We'd love to have you.

16:28.906 --> 16:31.825
She's got the whole world in her hands

16:34.036 --> 16:36.830
Did you and Owen have a fight
the night Chuck died?

16:37.748 --> 16:38.999
No.

16:39.082 --> 16:40.375
Are you sure?

16:40.834 --> 16:45.422
Owen got a phone call that upset him.
I'm trying to figure out who it was.

16:46.215 --> 16:48.717
Owen didn't kill Chuck, Poppy.

16:50.177 --> 16:53.972
He's wrong, but he genuinely believes
that Warren did it.

16:55.599 --> 16:57.601
He wouldn't have destroyed our family.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.019
Otherwise, he would--

17:06.151 --> 17:07.819
I'm taking you to the hospital.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.209
Hold on.

17:25.963 --> 17:26.964
In here.

17:33.971 --> 17:34.972
Don't move.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.361
Brother.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.116
Everything good?

17:54.700 --> 17:55.868
You tell me.

17:58.036 --> 18:00.372
I was just putting out a couple feelers.

18:02.332 --> 18:04.084
And who gave you sanction?

18:04.835 --> 18:07.045
It's natural to ask questions.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.339
Natural to want answers.

18:10.382 --> 18:13.218
But it is not natural to disobey orders.

18:13.635 --> 18:15.470
So what am I supposed to do?

18:15.554 --> 18:21.185
Walk around exposed,
not knowing who tried to kill me?

18:22.394 --> 18:24.646
The man who moved on you will be DP'd.

18:26.231 --> 18:29.610
He will not jump outta line again. Ever.

18:32.070 --> 18:33.071
But neither will you.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.826
You understand why I'm tethering you?

18:41.163 --> 18:42.748
Trying to save my soul?

18:43.207 --> 18:46.543
Your soul can rot. I don't give a shit.

18:47.878 --> 18:50.881
But you get in a fight, lockdown happens.

18:51.381 --> 18:54.176
You get shanked, lockdown happens.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.221
And that shit affects my business.

18:58.472 --> 18:59.973
Can't happen.

19:00.974 --> 19:01.975
Understood?

20:08.750 --> 20:09.960
You doing all right?

20:11.712 --> 20:13.255
-Here.
-I am now.

20:15.257 --> 20:17.134
She'll be a little out of it for a bit.

20:18.218 --> 20:20.179
Gotcha. I'll stay with her.

20:28.729 --> 20:29.855
Melanie?

20:31.231 --> 20:35.110
You know it's okay
if you were fighting that night.

20:35.444 --> 20:36.820
No one would blame you.

20:38.947 --> 20:44.369
If Owen was mad,
and he did something because he was mad...

20:45.913 --> 20:48.457
what he did was just on him.

20:48.916 --> 20:50.876
It's not your fault for calling him.

20:51.585 --> 20:52.794
I know.

20:55.756 --> 20:57.466
What was the fight about?

20:58.675 --> 21:00.093
I called...

21:01.887 --> 21:04.389
I told him I was going to leave him.

21:05.140 --> 21:08.268
You told Owen
that you were going to leave him?

21:10.145 --> 21:13.565
Owen was so furious. He was so...

21:17.903 --> 21:18.779
He--

21:18.862 --> 21:20.280
I'm so tired.

21:21.281 --> 21:22.282
Okay.

21:25.410 --> 21:27.788
And we're in the wrong parking lot.

21:27.871 --> 21:31.041
Sun's starting to set,
and we didn't wanna go back to the park.

21:31.124 --> 21:33.794
Right.
Yeah, I'd seen the sign about bears.

21:34.211 --> 21:35.337
I was very freaked out.

21:35.420 --> 21:36.839
Bears are really fast.

21:36.922 --> 21:38.131
-They are.
-Yeah.

21:38.215 --> 21:40.300
-Lightning fast.
-We decided to hitchhike.

21:40.384 --> 21:42.803
I think it took about an hour
before someone picked us up?

21:42.886 --> 21:44.596
-A brave couple.
-Yeah.

21:44.680 --> 21:46.932
And the wife was hitting on
this one the entire time.

21:47.015 --> 21:48.934
-You say that every time. She didn't.
-She was.

21:49.017 --> 21:50.561
Mommy, I need to go to the bathroom.

21:50.853 --> 21:52.396
You don't need my help, do you?

21:52.479 --> 21:53.647
I want your company.

21:53.730 --> 21:56.817
Oh, well, in that case,
we'll be right back.

21:56.900 --> 21:57.901
Yeah.

22:04.324 --> 22:06.785
Hey, sorry we're talking at you all night.

22:08.287 --> 22:11.331
No, it's fine. Really. It was nice.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.959
You know, takes a little pressure off.

22:15.002 --> 22:18.213
Yeah. This must be bizarre for you.

22:19.840 --> 22:21.175
Kind of.

22:21.258 --> 22:24.803
For what it's worth, Lanie's missed you.

22:29.433 --> 22:30.934
Lanie, get off of her!

22:33.187 --> 22:36.857
Can you come back and hang out,
Aunt Josie? I like looking at you.

22:38.734 --> 22:40.360
I like looking at you too.

22:40.444 --> 22:42.863
I wish you were here when I was born.

22:47.451 --> 22:50.078
I should probably get going.

22:51.205 --> 22:52.372
Long day tomorrow.

22:52.873 --> 22:57.544
So... I will see you at the service.
Thank you.

23:00.005 --> 23:02.883
Josie. Josie, wait. Wait.

23:08.305 --> 23:12.476
You know what I've been thinking about
on a loop since I got here?

23:14.228 --> 23:15.354
Your face...

23:18.106 --> 23:19.858
and what it looked like when I woke up

23:19.942 --> 23:24.363
to find you pressing a pillow into mine
so that I couldn't breathe.

23:24.780 --> 23:26.782
-You tried to kill me.
-No.

23:26.865 --> 23:28.784
Aunt Susan had to pull you off of me.

23:29.201 --> 23:30.661
No, I know, but--

23:31.453 --> 23:35.082
I was an open wound back then. I was.

23:35.165 --> 23:38.752
Every part of me hurt all the time.
I was angry at everything.

23:38.836 --> 23:40.754
I understand
that this doesn't make any sense,

23:40.838 --> 23:44.716
but I needed you
to feel what I was feeling.

23:44.800 --> 23:48.470
Okay? I needed you to feel the rawness
and the panic.

23:48.554 --> 23:50.597
I was so wrapped up in it, and--

23:56.353 --> 23:59.106
I wasn't trying to kill you, Josie.

24:01.316 --> 24:02.985
I was trying to kill myself.

24:09.533 --> 24:12.244
But I'm in control of my life now.

24:12.744 --> 24:13.745
Hello?

24:14.246 --> 24:15.789
No, I can see that.

24:16.373 --> 24:21.128
And that is why I think it would be best
if I left right after the funeral.

24:21.211 --> 24:23.630
We can have this time and then--

24:24.339 --> 24:25.174
What?

24:25.257 --> 24:28.886
Like you can't see it.
Lanie, please, I know that you can.

24:29.386 --> 24:34.725
I know that you can feel the same thing
just creeping back in this family.

24:34.808 --> 24:36.018
It's just...

24:37.269 --> 24:38.979
-Hey.
-Give us a second.

24:39.855 --> 24:41.565
Your mom was just arrested.

24:43.066 --> 24:45.152
-What?
-For breaking and entering.

24:45.611 --> 24:46.653
That.

24:50.199 --> 24:51.408
Your new spot?

24:53.035 --> 24:57.164
I don't wanna waste an inch
of this beautiful house.

24:59.541 --> 25:00.584
Yeah.

25:02.419 --> 25:03.295
You okay?

25:04.338 --> 25:05.339
Sure.

25:07.049 --> 25:09.718
You wanna talk about
the other night at the jail?

25:09.801 --> 25:11.053
Not yet.

25:11.637 --> 25:15.307
You don't tiptoe around much,
except your father.

25:15.724 --> 25:16.934
I need time.

25:18.977 --> 25:22.981
Shreve drew a line in the sand, baby.

25:23.315 --> 25:25.817
I mean, there's not a person in my family

25:25.901 --> 25:28.445
who would ever assault
another family member.

25:28.529 --> 25:31.240
-Assault is a strong word.
-Yes, it is.

25:31.323 --> 25:33.992
That's the difference in how you grew up
and how I grew up.

25:34.076 --> 25:37.621
Well, we can't just act like
it didn't happen. Who does that serve?

25:38.872 --> 25:42.167
Okay, okay, tell me your plan.

25:42.251 --> 25:44.127
It doesn't have to be complicated.

25:47.256 --> 25:51.260
Nothing is ever simple out here.

25:54.054 --> 25:56.181
My father is sick.

25:56.932 --> 26:00.853
He's not in his right mind.
He didn't know what he was doing.

26:01.478 --> 26:06.108
Take him to a doctor then.
Get him checked out. Get clarity.

26:07.025 --> 26:08.986
It's time. Something has to be done.

26:09.069 --> 26:11.446
I'm trying to get everyone here
on board with that.

26:11.530 --> 26:12.906
No. Don't wait.

26:13.407 --> 26:16.910
If he's so out of it that he gets physical
with his own daughter

26:16.994 --> 26:18.203
in front of her husband...

26:18.579 --> 26:19.663
No.

26:19.746 --> 26:23.542
I'd like to see him get checked out
by the end of the week.

26:23.625 --> 26:26.420
If not, I'm prepared
to file a restraining order.

26:26.503 --> 26:30.132
I've already filled out all the forms.
All I have to do is get them to a judge.

26:30.215 --> 26:31.758
-Are you serious?
-Dead.

26:31.842 --> 26:37.764
Look, baby,
I am going to drag your country-ass family

26:37.848 --> 26:41.018
into this century
if it's the last thing I do.

26:47.983 --> 26:52.779
Owen Cave's second 911 call,
the 4:44 mystery woman?

26:52.863 --> 26:54.406
Carmela Isaacs. Full ghost.

26:54.865 --> 26:56.158
She doesn't exist?

26:56.241 --> 27:00.871
I checked everything. DMV, police records,
death certificates, mental institutions.

27:00.954 --> 27:03.749
Not just in California,
but national databases.

27:03.832 --> 27:07.878
There's no record of her
since December of 1999.

27:08.295 --> 27:10.923
She called about
a domestic violence dispute.

27:12.382 --> 27:16.970
I did a series for the Times once
about the domestic violence epidemic.

27:17.930 --> 27:21.391
Victims often change their names
to escape their abusers.

27:21.475 --> 27:23.644
Beat you to it.
Name changes are public domain.

27:23.727 --> 27:26.355
Except when they're sealed
at the victim's request.

27:27.439 --> 27:29.983
I'll see if Markus can pull a few strings.

27:30.067 --> 27:31.944
Sounds good. Talk to you later.

27:34.446 --> 27:36.907
So, how'd you do it?

27:38.700 --> 27:40.410
You know, that's what they all wanna know.

27:40.494 --> 27:43.413
No, seriously,
how did you find our missing witness?

27:44.081 --> 27:47.626
File clerk I used to work with
pulled a few strings for me.

27:47.709 --> 27:49.086
He still with the city?

27:49.920 --> 27:51.004
She.

27:53.632 --> 27:55.133
I see.

28:00.264 --> 28:01.932
You didn't have to let me stay overnight.

28:02.015 --> 28:03.517
I came when I could. Hey.

28:04.685 --> 28:07.396
Why'd you go to the old house?
What were you doing there?

28:08.188 --> 28:09.815
Skipping down memory lane.

28:09.898 --> 28:13.902
I don't know what you're doing,
but you need to stop. Okay?

28:13.986 --> 28:16.989
-Whatever it is. Stop.
-You need to be more grateful.

28:17.072 --> 28:20.742
I was not there for me.
I was there for you and for your sister.

28:21.326 --> 28:22.786
Jesus Christ.

28:26.957 --> 28:28.333
Have you found Josie yet?

28:29.084 --> 28:30.085
No.

28:33.463 --> 28:36.592
Try to stay out of jail
before Susan's funeral, please.

28:37.801 --> 28:39.052
Fuck Susan.

28:45.601 --> 28:50.689
Look, I am just trying to prove
that I was framed.

28:51.857 --> 28:55.319
Well, what I don't get is why some darkie
gives two shits about you.

28:55.736 --> 28:57.154
Something you're not telling us?

28:57.237 --> 28:59.823
She gonna say something on her show
about you getting shanked?

29:00.324 --> 29:03.202
Maybe people start
sending you sympathy cakes.

29:03.285 --> 29:04.411
You know what?

29:04.828 --> 29:06.246
If you're nice to me, Dyson,

29:06.330 --> 29:10.250
I can get her to put you
on her show next season,

29:10.334 --> 29:14.379
and then she can convince
everybody in the world

29:14.463 --> 29:20.511
that it wasn't you on tape
who shot that old woman in the head.

29:21.345 --> 29:22.262
How about that?

29:29.019 --> 29:30.020
Boys.

29:35.651 --> 29:38.820
Couple Mexicans in front of me
were talking about you on the way in.

29:39.530 --> 29:43.325
Took Spanish in high school.
I understood every word.

29:46.787 --> 29:50.207
So? Who was it?

29:54.127 --> 29:57.548
He said he was gonna get a gun
and come back and kill me.

29:57.840 --> 29:59.424
-Who?
-My father.

29:59.842 --> 30:03.345
So I called the police.
They came very fast.

30:03.679 --> 30:05.973
Only one man. A detective.

30:07.558 --> 30:08.767
Was it him?

30:09.226 --> 30:10.519
That looks like him.

30:11.019 --> 30:14.022
Can you tell me anything about him?

30:15.315 --> 30:19.111
He was very kind. Professional.
Tried to be helpful.

30:19.528 --> 30:21.905
But he was... agitated?

30:22.322 --> 30:25.158
Sweating a lot even though it was October.
It wasn't hot out.

30:25.701 --> 30:28.120
He said it had been a long, busy night.

30:28.954 --> 30:31.957
I didn't understand what that meant
until the next day.

30:32.040 --> 30:33.166
What did it mean?

30:33.709 --> 30:36.920
The next morning I noticed red smudges
all over the carpet.

30:37.504 --> 30:40.174
I got down to clean them out,
and I realized it was blood.

30:41.008 --> 30:46.847
Detective Cave showed up to your house
at 4:44 a.m. with blood on his shoes?

30:46.930 --> 30:48.599
-Yes.
-Are you sure?

30:48.682 --> 30:52.102
Yes. We had to get the carpets replaced.

30:56.690 --> 30:57.524
Come on!

31:01.653 --> 31:04.031
Cave. When?

31:05.449 --> 31:06.658
Well, how?

31:10.162 --> 31:11.538
What I want you to do now?

31:12.539 --> 31:15.042
I want you to go back in time
and do it right.

31:15.792 --> 31:18.128
Owen. Who was that?

31:18.629 --> 31:19.880
It's nothing.

31:31.433 --> 31:33.477
This the only place
you could find to hide?

31:34.186 --> 31:35.270
There's AC.

31:36.355 --> 31:37.356
So?

31:38.190 --> 31:39.274
So.

31:39.358 --> 31:44.988
Uh-uh, I need to hear you say it, loudly
and clearly, "Poppy, you were right."

31:45.447 --> 31:48.784
I'll say it when it's for real for real.
But I will tell you this.

31:48.867 --> 31:51.411
The motherfucker
is looking guiltier by the minute.

31:51.495 --> 31:54.414
I mean, I don't think I ever came home
with blood on my shoes.

31:54.498 --> 31:56.124
And I was Oakland PD.

31:56.208 --> 31:59.002
He's scared. I hope he's losing his shit.

31:59.628 --> 32:03.215
See, that right there,
that look on your face could win wars.

32:05.425 --> 32:07.219
So what's happening?
We gonna celebrate or what?

32:07.302 --> 32:10.681
Bet. Where to? Not The Knock.

32:11.723 --> 32:13.308
How long you gonna
shoot your sister to the left?

32:13.392 --> 32:16.687
-To hell with all of 'em.
-Damn. What happened?

32:16.770 --> 32:19.314
-Leave it alone.
-No, hell no. So tell me.

32:19.398 --> 32:20.399
-Let it go.
-Why?

32:20.482 --> 32:21.775
Because I said so.

32:22.359 --> 32:25.195
You know, I remember that tone.
You were famous for that.

32:25.279 --> 32:26.363
You brought it on yourself.

32:26.446 --> 32:29.616
But, you know, back when you and I
used to fool with each other,

32:29.700 --> 32:32.578
I was famous for not giving a shit
about that tone.

32:32.953 --> 32:34.162
So spit it out.

32:38.208 --> 32:41.753
I feel like I'm under siege
from all sides.

32:42.337 --> 32:44.381
You heard about the bar
getting raided, right?

32:44.464 --> 32:45.674
Yeah, I heard about it.

32:45.757 --> 32:47.092
It's full circle.

32:47.176 --> 32:50.971
Owen sicced his goons on us
and things spiraled.

32:51.388 --> 32:55.809
They arrested Cydie on a bullshit warrant.
Humiliated her.

32:56.810 --> 32:58.520
Daddy was so furious.

33:00.022 --> 33:01.940
He grabbed me by my throat.

33:02.357 --> 33:03.358
What?

33:05.903 --> 33:10.741
I don't have the words.
And I always have the words.

33:14.912 --> 33:16.330
The way he looked at me...

33:20.334 --> 33:21.335
Listen to me.

33:21.960 --> 33:24.713
You cannot be scared of the look
in your father's eyes,

33:25.255 --> 33:28.008
and you damn sure
can't let some crooked cop

33:28.091 --> 33:30.344
be the reason you don't end up
with your family.

33:31.220 --> 33:36.808
I mean, you may not be able
to fix everything, but you gotta try.

33:38.852 --> 33:40.187
Whatever that looks like.

33:49.238 --> 33:53.242
Quiroga, something's wrong with Jax.

33:54.368 --> 33:56.119
Who was looking after him when I was gone?

33:57.162 --> 33:58.455
We were all on rotation.

33:59.414 --> 34:02.334
Well, somebody gave him something
they shouldn't have.

34:03.377 --> 34:04.795
Come here. Take a look.

34:13.303 --> 34:15.514
I know it was you who shanked me,
you little bitch.

34:15.597 --> 34:16.806
No, man, I swear.

34:17.391 --> 34:18.725
I wanna know why.

34:18.809 --> 34:20.435
You got it wrong.

34:23.522 --> 34:25.690
I got hired, all right? Please.

34:25.774 --> 34:27.775
-Bullshit.
-I'm telling you.

34:27.860 --> 34:30.821
My girl got busted for possession.
They were gonna take my son away.

34:30.904 --> 34:32.531
He made it go away.

34:33.824 --> 34:34.992
I want a name.

34:35.074 --> 34:37.202
The cop who came to visit you.

34:58.515 --> 35:01.768
Hey, hey! Get him off me!

35:24.249 --> 35:25.542
Aus, Jax, aus!

35:30.255 --> 35:31.298
Get him off!

35:37.971 --> 35:42.100
So tired of trying to hold on

35:42.184 --> 35:44.645
It's looking crystal clear now

35:44.728 --> 35:47.689
Borderline is near now

35:47.773 --> 35:53.779
I can just breathe, yeah, yeah

35:53.862 --> 35:57.366
I love that song. It is real sexy.

35:58.492 --> 36:01.370
She ain't never giving you none, Herbie,
so stop.

36:08.877 --> 36:10.462
-Hey.
-Hey.

36:10.546 --> 36:14.341
Not now. Okay, why don't I cook,
you come over, and the three of us can--

36:14.424 --> 36:15.425
Can we talk?

36:15.884 --> 36:17.094
You can.

36:17.761 --> 36:18.762
Okay.

36:21.390 --> 36:23.809
I'm sorry that you got swept up like that.

36:24.685 --> 36:26.979
I'm sorry that those officers
treated you that way.

36:27.062 --> 36:30.190
I'm sorry that they embarrassed you.

36:31.775 --> 36:35.112
I'm sorry that you have to live
with that memory. You shouldn't have to.

36:35.195 --> 36:37.656
You're sorry those officers
did what they did.

36:38.448 --> 36:40.701
-Where you in that?
-Too soon for this.

36:40.784 --> 36:43.370
We don't call them officers
in this family neither.

36:43.453 --> 36:46.456
Especially when they trying to
shut my bar down because of you.

36:46.540 --> 36:48.417
I got it, Daddy. It's okay.

36:50.627 --> 36:54.339
So what you want me to say?
"Everything's good"? "We good"?

36:55.424 --> 36:57.009
-You want me to lie?
-I wanna fix it.

36:57.092 --> 37:00.846
They strip-searched me over some
parking tickets. How you gonna fix that?

37:01.221 --> 37:03.140
You gonna make my mug shot disappear?

37:03.223 --> 37:06.351
Or explain to my job
why I missed my shift?

37:06.894 --> 37:08.604
You know they put me on probation?

37:08.687 --> 37:09.730
-Cydie--
-Save it.

37:10.314 --> 37:12.441
I did not come over here to fight.

37:13.150 --> 37:14.359
I promise you, baby sis.

37:17.946 --> 37:18.864
Okay.

37:20.657 --> 37:24.244
I know you're angry with me, Daddy,
and you can have that.

37:24.870 --> 37:26.955
-But I am angry with you too.
-You're angry?

37:27.039 --> 37:31.335
You know what, Daddy? I will give you
some grace because I know you need help.

37:31.793 --> 37:35.130
My father would have never done to me
what you did the other day.

37:39.510 --> 37:43.305
Pickles, grilled onions, side of fries.
Great. Thank you.

37:47.726 --> 37:49.853
Look, I know they're acting
like everything's normal

37:49.937 --> 37:51.188
when they're around me.

37:53.273 --> 37:55.609
But they're listening
to that podcast, right?

37:56.568 --> 37:59.738
Don't think it's affected
anyone's job performance, sir.

38:03.075 --> 38:08.789
I just want you to know what that
Parnell woman is saying are speculations.

38:09.456 --> 38:10.666
It's bunk.

38:13.710 --> 38:14.837
I understand.

38:15.254 --> 38:16.797
Cedros, your order's ready.

38:22.803 --> 38:25.222
I hate eulogies that aren't honest.

38:26.223 --> 38:30.978
You know the ones that paint the portraits
of the saintly people

38:31.061 --> 38:36.608
who donate all their money to charity,
never whispered a bad word.

38:38.527 --> 38:39.945
So...

38:40.696 --> 38:44.199
it was very important to me
that I not leave this podium

38:44.616 --> 38:50.497
before mentioning that my Aunt Susan
really loved bad words.

38:52.249 --> 38:54.459
It was her favorite thing:
A good bad word.

38:58.088 --> 38:59.339
When I was younger...

39:02.593 --> 39:05.429
sometimes I felt like
I was trapped in my head.

39:06.221 --> 39:09.808
Like my brain was a maze
and there was no exit,

39:09.892 --> 39:14.104
and it was Susan
who helped me find my way out.

39:14.188 --> 39:18.317
And I know for a fact I would not be
standing here if it were not for her so...

39:19.985 --> 39:22.112
I just wanted to thank her for that.

39:29.953 --> 39:31.914
Now anyone with a memory to share...

39:31.997 --> 39:34.791
-That was perfect.
-...or a final wish to impart.

39:34.875 --> 39:36.543
You should say something.

39:36.627 --> 39:38.378
You're welcome to come and do so now.

39:39.630 --> 39:42.591
I'm really happy you're here.
Even if you don't stay.

39:56.396 --> 39:57.731
Your mother's here.

40:03.195 --> 40:04.655
Jesus Christ, she's trashed.

40:04.738 --> 40:06.823
I thought you said that she wasn't coming.

40:07.324 --> 40:09.576
Alex. Please.

40:10.244 --> 40:12.955
-Erin--
-No. I get to grieve too!

40:21.004 --> 40:24.800
Two peas in a pod. Look at you.

40:25.551 --> 40:28.887
You are embarrassing yourself.
You need to leave.

40:28.971 --> 40:30.013
Really?

40:30.514 --> 40:34.351
Am I embarrassing myself, Jojo?

40:40.023 --> 40:41.024
Sorry.

40:46.238 --> 40:51.201
Susan was my little sister,
and we never got along.

40:52.286 --> 40:54.246
And she had bad taste.

40:55.455 --> 40:57.082
I told her.

40:57.165 --> 41:01.420
With her run-over
Ross Dress For Less heels,

41:01.503 --> 41:03.005
knitted sweaters...

41:04.298 --> 41:07.050
There was only one thing
that we agreed on: My daughters.

41:07.134 --> 41:08.427
I'll give her that.

41:08.510 --> 41:12.097
When they were babies, she used to
come over at night and help me.

41:12.723 --> 41:14.683
And she would hold one baby
and I would hold the other.

41:14.766 --> 41:17.811
And we would rock them
and we would sing to them.

41:37.289 --> 41:40.667
Where are you going, I don't mind

41:43.212 --> 41:48.967
I've killed my world
And I've killed my time

41:50.761 --> 41:56.225
So where do I go? What do I see?

41:58.602 --> 42:03.315
I see many people coming after me

42:05.192 --> 42:07.903
So where are you going to...

42:09.321 --> 42:11.823
I don't mind

42:14.284 --> 42:20.290
If I live too long I'm afraid I'll die

42:23.502 --> 42:27.714
So I will follow you wherever you go

42:30.509 --> 42:36.932
If your offered hand is still open to me

42:40.769 --> 42:44.940
Strangers on this road we are on

42:48.193 --> 42:50.904
We are not two, we are one
