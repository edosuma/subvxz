07:57.164 --> 07:58.336
What do you do?

07:58.361 --> 07:59.727
Limited edition Apricot lip kit,

07:59.767 --> 08:02.646
- or Head Over Heels lip kit?
- Limited edition?

08:02.671 --> 08:03.903
I'll show it to you again.

08:03.928 --> 08:06.029
Apricot isn't limited edition anymore.

08:06.139 --> 08:08.871
- Okay?
- Right, of course. I knew that.

08:09.404 --> 08:11.312
For David? Thanks, man.

08:11.532 --> 08:13.104
Ice on the side.

08:14.591 --> 08:16.721
- Thank you.
- Wow, is that for me?

08:16.746 --> 08:17.844
Yeah.

08:17.869 --> 08:19.377
That's really thoughtful.

08:19.402 --> 08:21.487
Hi. Can I help you?

08:21.512 --> 08:22.806
I overheard you talking about getting

08:22.831 --> 08:24.323
the Valentine's edition colors,

08:24.598 --> 08:26.208
but I really think you could pull off

08:26.233 --> 08:28.561
the Holiday 2016 color palette.

08:28.756 --> 08:30.622
The Holiday... what...

08:30.904 --> 08:33.188
Those colors are
all so dark. I don't...

08:33.212 --> 08:35.179
It would be a really good look for you.

08:35.254 --> 08:36.462
And you all think this?

08:36.488 --> 08:38.604
You all think that I could
pull off those dark browns

08:38.629 --> 08:40.642
and burgundies on my porcelain skin?

08:40.667 --> 08:41.667
- Totally!
- Yes!

08:41.716 --> 08:43.616
[GIRL] So hot.

08:44.256 --> 08:46.549
I'm Esther. Do you guys
wanna hang out in my tent?

08:46.574 --> 08:48.388
I have orange slices and sticker books.

08:48.413 --> 08:50.707
Sure. Where did you even
get this cool tent?

08:50.811 --> 08:52.204
Uhm, oh I got it online

08:52.229 --> 08:54.937
with mac and cheese
proofs of purchases.

08:55.348 --> 08:57.185
Benji said those teens
can't be trusted.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.204
Those were the other teens.

08:59.229 --> 09:01.490
- These ones are my friends.
- I don't know, Esther.

09:01.515 --> 09:03.412
[WOMAN] Store opens
in 30 minutes.

09:03.683 --> 09:05.416
- [CROWD SCREAMING]
- Oh, my God.

09:05.859 --> 09:07.442
Where the hell is Benji?

09:07.467 --> 09:08.875
He should be here.

09:09.022 --> 09:11.197
Are you tracking his phone location?

09:11.259 --> 09:13.785
Oh, I turned on location sharing
when he was in the shower once,

09:13.810 --> 09:15.431
just for his own safety.

09:15.456 --> 09:18.123
That's... really thoughtful, Esther.

09:18.312 --> 09:19.511
Safety's super important.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.625
I know. Oh, my God!

09:21.675 --> 09:23.160
He's at a fish store?!

09:23.185 --> 09:25.318
Why would he bail on me
at the last second?

09:25.343 --> 09:27.008
They could be holding him
against his will.

09:27.033 --> 09:29.166
That stuff happens way more
often than people think.

09:29.191 --> 09:30.253
I don't know what to do.

09:30.278 --> 09:31.949
I really wanna trauma
bond with those teens,

09:31.974 --> 09:33.604
but we really need Benji here.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.441
I'll go get Benji.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.575
Oh, thank you so much

09:37.600 --> 09:40.013
for being my damn rock today, David.

09:40.038 --> 09:41.370
No problem.

09:41.989 --> 09:43.922
Hey, you guys,

09:44.948 --> 09:46.297
do you guys like Zendaya?

09:46.373 --> 09:48.373
- [ALL] Yeah.
- I love her.

09:48.398 --> 09:51.299
Harry Styles is, like, whatever, right?

09:54.701 --> 09:57.535
I've been making eye
contact with the same fish

09:57.560 --> 09:59.214
for, like, 30 seconds,

09:59.333 --> 10:01.200
and it's really powerful.

10:01.415 --> 10:04.282
The inside of this tank is mirrored.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.861
Yeah. It's like it's

10:06.886 --> 10:09.866
reflecting my hopes and
dreams back at me.

10:09.891 --> 10:11.974
No, man, the walls are mirrored.

10:11.999 --> 10:13.254
They're looking at themselves,

10:13.279 --> 10:15.293
but they're tricked, and they think
they're looking at a friend.

10:15.318 --> 10:16.936
Oh. Oh, yeah.

10:17.178 --> 10:19.441
Then I should get mirrors in my room.

10:20.581 --> 10:22.369
Hey, man, it's David.

10:22.430 --> 10:24.884
Hey, man, it's Benji.
I know who you are.

10:24.909 --> 10:26.072
Hey, my name is Stan.

10:26.097 --> 10:27.643
Good. Hey, Esther's freaking out.

10:27.668 --> 10:29.167
She's been in the sun way too long,

10:29.192 --> 10:31.152
and teenagers are breaking her
down, trying to cut in line.

10:31.177 --> 10:33.321
All right, let's go help Esther

10:33.346 --> 10:34.932
live her best life.

10:35.129 --> 10:37.096
It's so cool how supportive you are.

10:37.211 --> 10:39.688
My roommates won't even let me
cook chili for them anymore.

10:40.040 --> 10:43.005
Whoa! Who are these guys?

10:43.030 --> 10:45.133
Those are mandarin gobies.

10:45.158 --> 10:46.544
They're actually on sale.

10:46.569 --> 10:48.746
Buy one, get the second one half off.

10:48.788 --> 10:50.352
They're really hard to kill.

10:50.437 --> 10:52.041
You mean they're easy to take care of.

10:52.108 --> 10:53.811
No, they're really hard to kill.

10:54.061 --> 10:55.647
Benji, do you have an aquarium?

10:55.672 --> 10:57.526
No, it's just a fantasy right now.

10:57.551 --> 10:58.980
You have to get one of these.

10:59.005 --> 11:01.757
Cool guy like you, you gotta
have the coolest fish.

11:01.782 --> 11:03.759
Wait a sec. What is that?

11:03.784 --> 11:05.201
It looks expensive.

11:05.226 --> 11:07.376
[STAN] That is
the golden puffer,

11:07.401 --> 11:09.401
the jewel of the tank.

11:10.173 --> 11:12.026
Okay, I want that one,
and I'm naming it Marisol.

11:12.051 --> 11:13.350
[BOTH] Cool!

11:17.532 --> 11:19.822
Where have you been? Where's Benji?

11:19.847 --> 11:22.755
Man, he is getting a sweet set-up

11:22.780 --> 11:24.326
with really great fish.

11:24.473 --> 11:27.974
There's a dogfish,
a small fish with big teeth,

11:27.999 --> 11:30.529
- a big fish with small teeth.
- What?

11:30.554 --> 11:32.509
- Cool gloves.
- Oh, thank you.

11:32.534 --> 11:34.103
Are you about to do
a magic trick for the teens?

11:34.128 --> 11:36.796
No, it's actually a sea salt
vitamin hand mask.

11:36.849 --> 11:38.280
The teenagers gave 'em to me.

11:38.305 --> 11:39.906
They said it will help activate it.

11:40.050 --> 11:41.583
It's probably done by now.

11:42.851 --> 11:44.811
- [GASPS]
- Oooh...

11:44.951 --> 11:46.577
I think they looked better before.

11:46.602 --> 11:49.210
Benji usually stops me
from using strangers' cosmetics.

11:49.284 --> 11:51.110
Okay, you're just having a reaction.

11:51.135 --> 11:52.442
Do you have any allergies?

11:52.467 --> 11:53.795
Uh, yes, I do.

11:53.869 --> 11:58.101
I'm allergic to dust, feathers, grass,

11:58.301 --> 12:00.407
some wheats, some cookies.

12:00.442 --> 12:01.739
Okay, just remain calm.

12:01.764 --> 12:03.410
We're gonna bring the
swelling down here.

12:04.046 --> 12:05.654
There we go. That's nice.

12:05.754 --> 12:07.255
This day was supposed
to be about me, you know,

12:07.280 --> 12:08.682
and then Benji's making it about him,

12:08.717 --> 12:11.384
and it's like his 25th
birthday party all over again.

12:11.528 --> 12:13.687
No, he just seemed like
he was passionate about fish.

12:13.722 --> 12:16.213
It's good for people to have
hobbies, like your makeup thing.

12:16.238 --> 12:18.241
Okay, well, makeup
is more than a hobby.

12:18.448 --> 12:19.459
It's important you know that.

12:19.494 --> 12:20.694
Sure, sure.

12:21.112 --> 12:22.880
Can I see your wristband?

12:23.071 --> 12:24.270
Um, can I see your badge, please?

12:24.313 --> 12:26.442
- 26 and 27.
- Oh, cool.

12:26.467 --> 12:28.567
I'm 25. We're neighbors.

12:29.471 --> 12:32.026
I'm 25 1/2, if we're being technical.

12:32.053 --> 12:33.540
Um, I'm sorry, but,

12:34.392 --> 12:35.507
I just wanna let you know

12:35.532 --> 12:36.744
that's actually my friend
Benji's wristband.

12:36.769 --> 12:38.748
Actually, it is my wristband,

12:38.815 --> 12:41.548
'cause I just purchased it from
some weird guy at a fish store.

12:41.583 --> 12:44.208
If that were the case, that
would be extremely illegal,

12:44.233 --> 12:46.850
and you might be giving birth
to your baby in prison.

12:46.875 --> 12:48.531
Well, go ahead and hire yourself

12:48.556 --> 12:50.338
a legal team, and I'll take my chances.

12:50.363 --> 12:51.628
- I will. I will sue you.
- See you in court.

12:51.653 --> 12:53.506
- I'll sue you and your baby.
- I hope you do.

12:53.531 --> 12:55.649
Good. Is your baby even real?
It looks like a fake stomach.

12:55.674 --> 12:57.397
It's all round and perfect. Okay.

12:57.438 --> 12:59.138
Cool. Why don't you find out?
Why don't you touch it?

12:59.163 --> 13:00.462
- I will.
- And I'll slap your face.

13:00.487 --> 13:02.372
I won't touch it,
but I know that it's fake.

13:02.397 --> 13:03.677
You think just 'cause you're pregnant

13:03.702 --> 13:05.132
that the world just belongs to you,

13:05.163 --> 13:06.340
and you get to do whatever you want?

13:06.365 --> 13:07.401
Yeah, I've been really feeling

13:07.426 --> 13:08.601
like the world is my oyster lately.

13:08.626 --> 13:10.192
I can't sleep, I can't move,

13:10.217 --> 13:12.083
I waddle, my feet are huge,

13:12.160 --> 13:14.060
but, yeah, I feel
like Queen of the World.

13:14.085 --> 13:15.831
- Good luck. Best of luck to you.
- Good luck to you.

13:15.856 --> 13:18.195
- No, really good luck.
- Best wishes.

13:18.220 --> 13:20.503
- Happy New Year.
- Yeah, you, too. Have a good one.

13:20.590 --> 13:22.817
I have to get out of here.
Take care of this criminal.

13:22.842 --> 13:25.161
Yeah, I'm on it.
Birthday Edition mini-mattes,

13:25.186 --> 13:26.666
anything from
the Valentine's collection,

13:26.691 --> 13:28.761
and at least one
Cotton Candy Cream Kylighter.

13:28.786 --> 13:30.347
That is so, so sexy.

13:33.650 --> 13:36.336
I'm sorry, but I have
to root against you.

13:36.371 --> 13:38.238
Yeah, I don't care what you do.

13:38.739 --> 13:40.373
Benji!

13:41.309 --> 13:42.498
What's going on in here?

13:42.523 --> 13:44.377
Okay, I don't sell weed
out of here anymore.

13:44.413 --> 13:46.908
The smell is lingering.
It's baked in the rafters.

13:46.933 --> 13:48.059
I don't care about your drugs,

13:48.084 --> 13:50.535
but everyone does know users are losers.
Just keep that in mind.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.529
It's medicinal. I have
restless neck syndrome.

13:52.554 --> 13:54.968
I feel like I have that. Do you
know what the symptoms are?

13:54.993 --> 13:56.512
You don't have that. Your neck's fine.

13:56.593 --> 13:58.287
Are you buying fish?

13:58.474 --> 13:59.789
What's going on with your hands?

13:59.814 --> 14:02.315
The teens, they poisoned me.

14:02.452 --> 14:04.145
This is what happens
when you're not around.

14:04.170 --> 14:05.199
That's terrible.

14:05.224 --> 14:07.652
David said the only way to save
me is for you to come back

14:07.677 --> 14:09.793
and get your wristband back,
and get me my lip kits.

14:09.818 --> 14:11.336
I can't get my wristband back.

14:11.361 --> 14:12.874
That's not how scalping rules work.

14:12.899 --> 14:14.165
You don't know how the law works,

14:14.190 --> 14:15.654
and you're going to
prison for life, buddy,

14:15.679 --> 14:16.911
'cause I'm gonna call the cops,

14:16.936 --> 14:18.896
'cause I always tattle,
and you know that.

14:18.961 --> 14:21.853
I know for a fact that your dad
scalped Blackhawks tickets

14:21.878 --> 14:24.614
- and only went to jail for 24 hours.
- Don't bring that up.

14:24.639 --> 14:27.466
It was very traumatic seeing my
dad go away in a paddy wagon

14:27.491 --> 14:28.631
when I was just 11.

14:28.656 --> 14:31.071
I don't know if I can sell you
this fish in this environment.

14:31.114 --> 14:33.585
Fish have learned trauma. They're
very sensitive creatures.

14:33.610 --> 14:35.376
It's not like that.
My environment's fine.

14:35.411 --> 14:36.505
She's not my girlfriend.

14:36.530 --> 14:37.638
I'm not his girlfriend.

14:37.663 --> 14:39.973
Oh, so this
little pistol shrimp is single.

14:39.998 --> 14:41.753
My name is Stan.
I'm a small business owner.

14:41.778 --> 14:42.961
Nice to meet you.

14:42.986 --> 14:45.143
I'm Esther.
I'm an independent contractor.

14:45.168 --> 14:48.102
Very nice to meet you.
I'm enchanted, of course.

14:48.338 --> 14:49.684
I am seeing someone today, though,

14:49.709 --> 14:51.429
so we'll have to a pin in this.

14:51.957 --> 14:54.452
Oh. That's what this is about.

14:54.626 --> 14:57.545
You need fish to lord over
because you're jealous

14:57.570 --> 14:58.718
that I'm with David.

14:58.743 --> 15:01.697
Oh, please. You and
David went on one date.

15:02.023 --> 15:04.152
He bought me a $40 Postmates boba.

15:04.213 --> 15:05.546
- No promo?
- No promo.

15:06.142 --> 15:07.809
Esther, I'm really happy for you,

15:07.834 --> 15:10.841
but I'm a reefer now, and
this is where I belong.

15:10.866 --> 15:13.101
All right, I guess I'll
go get my lip kits without you.

15:13.149 --> 15:14.282
Some friendship.

15:14.391 --> 15:15.922
- [LAUGHING]
- So dramatic.

15:15.989 --> 15:18.199
All right, all right.

15:18.675 --> 15:20.381
She does have a point though, man.

15:20.496 --> 15:22.669
Reefers have really lonely lives.

15:22.985 --> 15:25.281
You were just saying
that you get tons of chicks.

15:25.504 --> 15:27.116
I lie to win.

15:28.718 --> 15:30.598

Relax, okay. Be safe, be safe.

15:38.087 --> 15:40.899
Don't push. Some people
are scared, here alone.

15:42.165 --> 15:44.175
David! Excuse me.

15:44.200 --> 15:45.966
Excuse me, sorry. I'm in there.
I'm in there. Sorry.

15:46.001 --> 15:48.066
Hi. I'm number 26.
The rest of my party's inside.

15:48.146 --> 15:50.108
Mm-hmm. Deli rules.

15:50.148 --> 15:52.900
- it's the end of the line.
- I don't follow.

15:53.891 --> 15:55.844
Okay, excuse me. Excuse me.

15:55.879 --> 15:57.812
Excuse me, sorry. My friends.

15:57.848 --> 16:00.317
You guys, friends, hey.
It's me, remember?

16:00.342 --> 16:01.742
You tried to poison me. It's all good.

16:01.767 --> 16:03.529
I don't care. You don't wanna hang?

16:03.563 --> 16:07.483
Okay. Okay. Excuse me.
Sorry. Emergency.

16:07.523 --> 16:09.858
Sorry. Fire marshal. Sorry.

16:10.459 --> 16:12.060
Hi. I had to leave the line

16:12.085 --> 16:13.695
to stop my short,
annoying Jewish friend

16:13.730 --> 16:15.184
from buying a saltwater fish tank.

16:15.209 --> 16:18.419
Oh, my God, that is the saddest
thing I've ever heard.

16:18.507 --> 16:20.929
I lost an uncle to ships in a bottle.

16:21.051 --> 16:23.416
- Please, go ahead of us.
- Thank you so much.

16:24.070 --> 16:26.306
All right, I followed your stupid rules

16:26.331 --> 16:27.597
and played your silly games.

16:27.944 --> 16:29.167
Let me in.

16:29.226 --> 16:31.025
The store is at capacity.

16:31.170 --> 16:32.236
What?

16:32.949 --> 16:34.800
But my sunglasses.

16:35.020 --> 16:37.189
I left them inside with my mom.

16:37.696 --> 16:39.579
You'll have to wait
till the next person leaves.

16:39.869 --> 16:40.869
David.

16:41.359 --> 16:42.961
Excuse me, excuse me.

16:43.013 --> 16:44.488
Excuse me, has anybody seen

16:44.513 --> 16:46.346
the Candy Cream Kylighter?

16:46.489 --> 16:48.602
He's doing it, he's doing it.

16:50.854 --> 16:52.634
David.

16:53.803 --> 16:56.286
Oh, my God, you got everything.

16:56.466 --> 16:58.890
I mean, except for the
limited edition Kylighter,

16:58.915 --> 17:00.364
but that was a pipe dream.

17:00.389 --> 17:03.506
Yeah. I mean, unless...

17:04.146 --> 17:05.445
Kylighter?!

17:06.070 --> 17:08.080
It's brown; it's all they had left.

17:08.211 --> 17:10.497
Brown. Okay, that... that's cool.

17:10.586 --> 17:12.279
Psych!

17:12.304 --> 17:14.640
It's Strawberry Shortcake.
I tricked <i> you</i> this time.

17:14.665 --> 17:18.116
Oh, my God! Um, can we go to my place?

17:18.141 --> 17:19.973
I really wanna put sweatpants on.

17:20.002 --> 17:23.137
Actually, Benji asked if I could
help him set up the fish tank.

17:23.439 --> 17:25.506
Oh, no. Well, can you just tell him no?

17:25.531 --> 17:27.297
I can't refuse to help someone, Esther.

17:27.383 --> 17:28.811
I took the Hippocratic oath.

17:28.878 --> 17:31.006
Okay. Will you hurry back?

17:31.066 --> 17:32.388
You got it.

17:34.203 --> 17:36.345
I'm a paramedic wife now.

17:37.947 --> 17:39.839
So how'd you get into fish?

17:39.864 --> 17:42.140
Well, I had a fish tank
when I was a little kid.

17:42.224 --> 17:44.257
I was sort of raised by
my housekeeper Marisol,

17:44.282 --> 17:45.850
and she helped me get my tank together.

17:45.875 --> 17:47.854
That's great.
I was raised by my parents.

17:47.879 --> 17:49.554
And then, she had to go to Oaxaca

17:49.579 --> 17:51.131
'cause her mom got really sick,

17:51.156 --> 17:53.179
and all my fish died,
but her mom's fine.

17:53.259 --> 17:55.392
Oh. So it's not all bad.

17:55.417 --> 17:57.842
I was staring at dead fish
for about a year and a half

17:57.867 --> 17:59.398
until anybody noticed.

17:59.498 --> 18:00.835
Yikes.

18:02.605 --> 18:03.923
Oh, my God.

18:04.076 --> 18:05.787
Look, please don't be judge-y.

18:05.882 --> 18:08.514
I know what you're thinking, but
you've got weird hobbies, too.

18:08.539 --> 18:10.184
We slept outside for makeup last night.

18:10.209 --> 18:11.788
You're gonna compare that
to being tricked

18:11.813 --> 18:13.901
by a tropical fish cult leader?

18:13.960 --> 18:17.719
Guys, hold on,
'cause that fish right there

18:18.190 --> 18:19.620
looks like it's wearing makeup,

18:19.731 --> 18:21.077
and that's the best of both worlds.

18:21.102 --> 18:23.002
David, that fish looks like
it needs makeup.

18:23.027 --> 18:25.582
- Don't bring Giselle into this.
- What are girls gonna think

18:25.607 --> 18:27.423
when you bring them
back to this fish hell?

18:27.448 --> 18:29.682
- Who cares what girls think?
- You do.

18:29.731 --> 18:32.123
- All the time.
- I don't know. Maybe they'll think,

18:32.148 --> 18:33.935
"Oh, I thought Benji
was a lonely loser,"

18:33.970 --> 18:35.600
and then they see the fish,
and then they'll be like,

18:35.625 --> 18:37.391
"Oh, he's actually kinda cool."

18:37.479 --> 18:39.212
Why don't you just be supportive?
How's that?

18:39.237 --> 18:40.933
I am being supportive, okay?

18:40.977 --> 18:43.143
But you are now a single adult male

18:43.168 --> 18:45.764
with a tropical fish tank
in your bed, okay?

18:45.915 --> 18:47.219
I tried to help you,

18:47.244 --> 18:49.440
but since you're now clearly
beyond being saved,

18:49.465 --> 18:51.231
there's something you should know.

18:51.733 --> 18:53.333
The only kind of girl
you're ever gonna get

18:53.358 --> 18:56.452
with a fish tank like
this is a girl like me.

18:56.859 --> 18:59.961
- I think your fish are cool.
- You're a fish girl.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.159
And just so you know,
I mean a girl like me.

19:02.184 --> 19:04.054
Obviously not me. I think you're gross.

19:04.079 --> 19:06.478
- You're gross.
- David, grab your purse. Let's go.

19:06.503 --> 19:08.170
I knew you had fish vibes.

19:08.671 --> 19:09.970
See ya, bud.

19:13.316 --> 19:15.382
Man, these [BLEEP] fish
are boring.

19:18.573 --> 19:20.573
Oh, my fish are starving.

19:22.344 --> 19:24.144
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:24.868 --> 19:26.582
Where's David? I thought
you guys were on a date.

19:26.607 --> 19:28.264
Yeah, we were on a date,

19:28.289 --> 19:30.782
and then a school bus
rolled over on the freeway,

19:30.807 --> 19:33.143
and he "had to go."

19:34.754 --> 19:37.089
Look, you've never dated
a guy with a job, right?

19:37.115 --> 19:40.205
He's literally saving
people's lives right now.

19:40.238 --> 19:42.333
Okay, well, I am not gonna compete

19:42.358 --> 19:43.820
for some guy's attention, okay?

19:43.845 --> 19:45.164
I'm too old for that shit.

19:45.189 --> 19:46.855
Cat's out of the bag.

19:47.134 --> 19:48.521
You're a fish girl.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.482
If you want, I'll take you
to the fish store

19:50.507 --> 19:51.654
and help you get a starter kit.

19:51.679 --> 19:54.580
It makes me sad that we have
another thing in common.

19:54.731 --> 19:57.071
What? It's fine.
I like fish, you like fish.

19:57.160 --> 20:00.518
Dude, your paramedic boyfriend
is crazy about fish.

20:00.543 --> 20:03.281
Oh, there's something
I have to tell you.

20:03.328 --> 20:05.043
- What?
- I maybe sent David,

20:05.068 --> 20:06.556
like, a million break-up texts

20:06.581 --> 20:07.671
that were totally insane,

20:07.696 --> 20:09.261
and I definitely can't come back from,

20:09.286 --> 20:11.090
and he's not my boyfriend anymore.

20:11.115 --> 20:13.231
- Did you send him a...
- Crying video? Yeah.

20:13.310 --> 20:15.377
But it was, like, a cute cry, you know.

20:15.426 --> 20:17.393
[SOBBING]

20:18.599 --> 20:19.748
Yeah, it's over.

20:19.773 --> 20:21.933
Look, if I have to have
a paramedic boyfriend,

20:21.958 --> 20:23.034
and I obviously do,

20:23.059 --> 20:26.414
I'm gonna get one the
old-fashioned way, okay, Benj?

20:26.516 --> 20:29.409
By faking an extremely
elaborate emergency.

20:29.695 --> 20:31.042
How much fro-yo do you
think I need to eat

20:31.067 --> 20:32.099
before I get hypothermia?

20:32.124 --> 20:34.658
You don't have to actually
get hypothermia.

20:35.474 --> 20:37.691
Did you buy any blue eyeshadow
at that Kylie thing?

20:37.754 --> 20:40.519
Oh, my God. You're a genius.

20:40.712 --> 20:42.934
Yeah, I'm a genius, but let's
finish our yogurts first.

20:42.959 --> 20:44.659
David made a lot of good choices.
