<i>My name is Lucas Scott.</i>

00:04.270 --> 00:07.501
<i>Four years ago, I graduated from</i>
<i>high school with my friends</i>

00:07.574 --> 00:09.371
<i>and we all went our separate ways.</i>

<i>Recently, we've all come home.</i>

<i>My ex-girlfriend, Peyton,</i>

00:16.583 --> 00:18.915
So we're gonna give you a chance.
Don't let us down.

00:19.652 --> 00:20.710
I won't.

00:20.787 --> 00:23.950
<i>And she's also getting to know</i>
<i>my girlfriend Lindsey. Sort of.</i>

00:24.024 --> 00:26.788
Peyton, hi. You just missed Lucas.

00:26.860 --> 00:29.158
Yeah, actually, I came here to see you.

00:29.696 --> 00:33.029
But for the record,
I'm not after Lucas, okay?

00:33.099 --> 00:35.158
<i>Haley just hired a nanny</i>
<i>for her son Jamie...</i>

00:35.235 --> 00:37.260
Look, Mama. Me and Daddy made mud.

00:38.004 --> 00:40.472
I'm sorry, who am I kidding?
How soon could you start?

00:41.674 --> 00:44.108
<i>... because her husband Nathan</i>
<i>has been in a wheelchair,</i>

00:44.177 --> 00:47.169
<i>but now seems to be recovering</i>
<i>in more ways than one.</i>

00:47.247 --> 00:50.410
- What is this?
- I figure it's a start, right?

00:52.285 --> 00:54.276
I've really missed you.

- Vacation's over.

01:09.035 --> 01:12.402
- It's time to get back to work.
- No, I'm not going back.

01:12.472 --> 01:13.939
- Brooke.
- Mother.

on how we deal with Victoria.

01:48.374 --> 01:49.568
- Really?
- Ready?

01:49.843 --> 01:52.368
I'll get the shovel
and you get ten feet of rope.

01:52.812 --> 01:57.010
- Too much?
- Maybe. What about you?

01:57.083 --> 01:59.711
Don't you have a band to turn into
rock stars or something?

01:59.786 --> 02:02.584
Yes, today is our first day in studio.

02:02.655 --> 02:05.055
I've gotta do
some other stuff beforehand, though.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.787
Okay. Good luck.

Straight to the hole, players.

Oh, okay, I guess we've gotta
stop leaving him with Skills.

Come on, champ.
There's a bath with your name on it.

03:29.842 --> 03:31.639
So how are you doing?

03:32.445 --> 03:34.845
I'm trying.
There's good days and bad days, right?

03:35.281 --> 03:37.875
You know, it's a really good thing we don't
have to worry about money,

03:37.951 --> 03:40.078
but I gotta figure out what I'm gonna do.

03:40.153 --> 03:41.814
Not all of us can have it together
all the time.

03:41.888 --> 03:45.255
- Please, if you only knew.
- I thought you had those kids in line.

03:45.325 --> 03:46.485
You remember that kid Quentin?

03:46.559 --> 03:48.789
The one that walked out
after I threatened to fail him?

03:48.861 --> 03:51.921
Well, next thing I know,
he got cut from the basketball team

03:51.998 --> 03:53.590
and he stopped showing up at school.

03:53.666 --> 03:55.725
- Haley, that's not your fault.
- Yeah, but I'm a teacher.

03:55.802 --> 03:58.566
I'm supposed to be saving these kids,
not running them off.

03:59.505 --> 04:02.099
I tried to talk with him,
but he wouldn't listen to me.

04:04.410 --> 04:08.972
Maybe if he had somebody
he could relate to, or...

04:09.048 --> 04:11.915
- Whatever you're thinking, stop it.
- Oh, come on.

04:11.985 --> 04:15.182
Haley, I'm the last person that
should be giving anybody a talk.

04:15.822 --> 04:19.485
You're like a basketball god
or something to these guys.

04:19.559 --> 04:22.027
And you're not a teacher,
which will really help.

04:23.296 --> 04:25.059
I think he might listen to you.

04:27.600 --> 04:28.692
All right, I'll think about it.

04:28.768 --> 04:29.826
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

04:29.902 --> 04:32.132
For what it's worth, I think it
might give you another good day.

04:32.205 --> 04:33.399
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:34.307 --> 04:37.140
So are you bringing back
the mullet or what?

You know, you're really hot when
you're not yelling about how much I suck.

- Yes, ma'am.

- MAN: All right.
- I don't see luggage.

05:56.556 --> 06:00.287
So this is why you disappeared

06:00.827 --> 06:03.762
from your work and your life
and your family.

06:05.031 --> 06:08.398
For a half-built shop
in the middle of a half-dead town.

06:08.468 --> 06:10.493
Don't say that. Tree Hill's home.

- Not anymore. Get in the car.
- No.

- Brooke.
- Just listen to me, please.

06:19.679 --> 06:23.137

behind this whole operation.

You know, that crossover wouldn't work
in the NBA or college, but it's not bad.

07:47.066 --> 07:49.728
- Yeah, you got any suggestions?
- You could try the fade-away.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.736
The fade-away's weak.

07:54.006 --> 07:59.410
So, heard you mixed it up
back in your day, huh?

07:59.779 --> 08:03.579
The girls, bookies... Oh, point-shaving.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.583
That was a long time ago, Quentin.

You ain't gotta explain
nothing to me, player.

Teacher didn't get you?

08:17.763 --> 08:19.492
You should be thankful.

08:19.565 --> 08:21.965
One more year,
I'd have broke your scoring record.

08:24.770 --> 08:27.136
Maybe there's something
we can do about that.

08:35.280 --> 08:38.375
Why do you always look extra sexy
right before you're about to leave?

08:38.451 --> 08:43.717
Oh, because I'm mean like that.
I'll be back from New York late Sunday.

08:45.124 --> 08:47.422
Try and stay out of trouble while I'm gone.

08:47.493 --> 08:49.961
Come on, what kind of trouble
could I get in without you?

08:53.599 --> 08:54.623

Lucas is getting dressed,
but he'll be out in a sec.

09:12.952 --> 09:15.318
Actually, I wanted
to apologize for yesterday.

09:15.388 --> 09:19.188
You were being nice, and I got bitchy
and weird and I'm really sorry.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.857
- Don't worry about it.
- Okay.

09:23.863 --> 09:26.559
Anyway, Brooke's having
her store opening tomorrow,

09:26.632 --> 09:28.361
and I didn't know if
maybe you wanted to go together.

09:28.434 --> 09:32.097
Like, we could go get dinner beforehand
and clean slate, you know?

09:32.171 --> 09:35.607
I'd love to, but I'm about to
hop on a plane to New York.

09:35.675 --> 09:38.542
Actually, Lucas is going.
You two should go together.

09:38.611 --> 09:40.841
He hates going to those things alone.

09:43.316 --> 09:45.375
I couldn't. I'm sorry, I honestly...

09:45.451 --> 09:47.885
I would just feel way too guilty
after how I behaved.

09:47.954 --> 09:50.149
I know. I'm counting on it.

09:50.222 --> 09:52.747
Besides, you'd have to be a
pretty awful person to do what you did

09:52.825 --> 09:55.316
and then hit on my boyfriend
while I'm out of town.

09:57.630 --> 09:59.325

Everybody expecting us
to turn this thing around this season.

Well, if anybody can do it,
it's you and Lucas.

10:20.419 --> 10:21.750

I just wanted to thank you for being
there for Haley and Jamie when I was...

10:34.200 --> 10:35.565
Don't worry about it.

10:37.303 --> 10:40.864
So, you here to teach these kids
how to win a championship?

10:40.940 --> 10:44.706
I have an idea on where to start.
You could put Quentin back on the team.

10:47.079 --> 10:50.378
- Haley put you up to this.
- She's got a thing for lost causes.

10:50.449 --> 10:52.076
And I watched the kid play.
He's really good.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.483
I'm not saying the kid doesn't have talent.

10:54.553 --> 10:57.954
Look, the fact is,
I don't have time to coach him,

10:58.391 --> 11:01.519
or deal with his crap, or teach
him to play an unselfish game.

11:01.594 --> 11:06.190
- Okay, what if I did?
- You're gonna come to practice?

11:07.266 --> 11:11.498
Every practice,
every day, five days a week.

11:11.570 --> 11:13.367
If that's what it takes.

11:15.641 --> 11:20.203
All right. I'll do it for you, not for him.

Let's pick up the pace, please.

- MAN: Okay.

13:03.482 --> 13:07.543
Well, well. You know, this morning,
I was half expecting you to disown me.

13:07.620 --> 13:12.216
Oh, Brooke. I want what's best for you.
Someday, you'll realize that.

13:12.291 --> 13:16.159
So, what can I do?
I'm offering my help if you want it.

13:20.966 --> 13:23.264
That is my assistant, Millicent.

who dresses like a Slavic bag lady.

13:26.906 --> 13:28.931
Stop it. She's great.

13:29.008 --> 13:32.944
And what you can do to help me
is do inventory with her.

Hi, Victoria. I'm really excited to be here.

- All of them.

13:43.155 --> 13:45.020
- But why...
- Go.

13:48.327 --> 13:51.353
I just don't understand how someone
who can write such soulful songs

13:51.430 --> 13:53.295

I might not play no defense at all.

The only reason that Brooke
returned to this backwater town

was because her loser friend
couldn't cut it in Los Angeles.

26:10.101 --> 26:13.002
Peyton, I know how important
this is to you.

26:13.071 --> 26:15.972
I promise you, I am not wrong.

26:21.446 --> 26:24.347
<i>Jason, you're fired.</i>

26:24.416 --> 26:26.384
What the...

26:29.955 --> 26:31.786
(MUTTERING ANGRILY)

26:32.057 --> 26:33.217
I can't believe...

26:33.291 --> 26:36.727
You know what?
You can come with me or stay and suck.

26:40.632 --> 26:44.090
Thanks, dawg. That's what I thought.
Mia, let's go.

26:44.903 --> 26:48.669
Mia, if you stay, you're gonna
make a great record. I'll help you.

26:48.740 --> 26:50.002
Mia, now.

26:53.678 --> 26:56.511
- I think I'm gonna stay.
- You're an idiot.

26:56.581 --> 26:58.515
Don't call me an idiot!

27:00.318 --> 27:02.718
And stop playing the ballads,
those are mine.

27:03.021 --> 27:07.355
You know what?
You just made a big mistake. All of you.

27:11.963 --> 27:13.362
Later, bitches!

27:16.401 --> 27:18.995
Everything's gonna be okay. I promise.

27:32.083 --> 27:34.574
You look amazing.

27:34.653 --> 27:38.885
Okay, I'm sorry, is this weird?
Because it feels really weird.

27:39.724 --> 27:43.182
Okay, look. We had a relationship.

27:43.261 --> 27:45.729
Okay, we can't pretend that we didn't.

27:48.500 --> 27:52.459
But before that,
we were really close friends.

27:54.239 --> 27:56.366
There's no reason
we can't have that again.

27:57.208 --> 28:00.200
- Right?
- Right.

28:01.279 --> 28:04.043
<i>(THE TAKE OVER, THE BREAKS OVER</i>
PLAYING)

28:23.268 --> 28:24.792
Brooke! How awesome is this?

28:24.869 --> 28:27.201
I know. I think that the whole town
showed up, you guys.

28:27.272 --> 28:31.368
I can't blame them. There hasn't
been a party here since, well, ever.

28:31.676 --> 28:33.143
I can't believe I got in looking like this.

28:33.211 --> 28:35.475
- Oh, don't. Stop.
- Where's Lindsey?

28:35.547 --> 28:38.141
- She's in New York. I came with Peyton.
- Oh.

28:39.117 --> 28:41.210
That is some dress.

28:41.286 --> 28:43.516
I don't know. You don't think it's too sexy?

28:43.588 --> 28:46.455
It's not something a respectable wife
or mother would wear.

28:46.524 --> 28:48.151
You should definitely get it.

28:49.194 --> 28:50.320
The dress is on me.

28:50.395 --> 28:54.229
- No, I can't let you do that.
- I can do anything I want. It's my party.

28:54.299 --> 28:58.292
Think of it as a present for taking
such good care of my godson.

28:59.003 --> 29:02.404
- Sorry I don't have anything for you, Nate.
- Oh, that's a present for me, too.

29:04.042 --> 29:06.943
And these press kits look just pathetic.

29:07.011 --> 29:09.445
But coming from you,
I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

29:10.615 --> 29:13.675
Hey, don't let it get to you.
I have a bitchy boss, too.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.880
On my first day of work,
she told me she hated my face.

29:16.955 --> 29:20.516
- Victoria threw a snakeskin purse at me.
- Mine threw me against the wall.

29:20.592 --> 29:24.323
- Oh, you must hate her.
- Yeah, kind of.

29:25.964 --> 29:27.625
I... I have to go.

29:31.336 --> 29:32.530
Excuse me.

29:32.604 --> 29:35.300
Oh, I know you.

29:36.040 --> 29:38.702
You're one of my daughter's
ill-chosen love interests.

29:39.978 --> 29:42.105
You must be very proud of Brooke.

29:42.180 --> 29:44.011
I mean, I can't believe
all she's accomplished.

29:44.082 --> 29:50.043
Yes, and her taste has greatly improved.
Thank God. If you'll excuse me.

29:52.290 --> 29:54.690
PEYTON: Oh, now, don't take it personally.

29:55.360 --> 29:57.294
- She just...
- Verbally punched you in the goodies?

29:57.362 --> 29:59.660
Yeah, that's how she says hi.

29:59.731 --> 30:02.894
And I thought Brooke was being
dramatic when she talked about her mom.

30:02.967 --> 30:04.491
Nope, all true.

30:04.736 --> 30:07.534
- Hey, P. Sawyer. I need you.
- Okay.

30:11.209 --> 30:14.269
- What's up?
- I have a little something for you.

30:14.646 --> 30:17.012
It's a present to say thanks
for helping me with everything.

30:17.081 --> 30:20.573
Brooke, I...
I love it, but you do not have to do this.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.483
You've already done so much for me.

30:25.323 --> 30:27.518
So how are things with Lucas?

30:28.259 --> 30:30.352
- What do you mean?
- Peyton.

30:31.362 --> 30:33.387
You asked me to be honest with you
about why I'm staying,

30:33.464 --> 30:34.897
and I need you to do the same with me.

30:34.966 --> 30:36.661
- Okay?
- Okay.

30:37.735 --> 30:42.104
Lucas seems really happy right now,
and we like Lindsey,

30:43.274 --> 30:45.572
and it's just not high school anymore.

30:45.643 --> 30:49.807
- Well, it's not about Lucas, okay?
- Okay, good.

30:51.316 --> 30:54.410
'Cause the cute bartender's been eyeing
you all night.

30:55.854 --> 30:58.414
- Oh.
- Oh.

31:06.531 --> 31:09.227
Hey. Man,
I've been looking everywhere for you.

31:09.300 --> 31:13.293
- Your sexy boss lady is here.
- I know, I saw her and her date.

31:13.371 --> 31:17.171
Man, don't feel bad about that.
Cougars go after all kind of prey.

31:17.242 --> 31:20.700
You can't change that. That's like telling
a rainbow not to be colorful.

31:21.579 --> 31:24.412
Yeah, well, I didn't sign up to
be some meaningless plaything.

31:25.350 --> 31:26.840
I'm done with this.

31:27.919 --> 31:29.318
See you.

31:30.054 --> 31:31.749
Mind if I call her?

31:37.829 --> 31:39.854
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:39.931 --> 31:41.626
Ready to go?

31:42.667 --> 31:44.931
Actually, I think I'm gonna stay.

31:45.003 --> 31:48.268
So... Goodnight.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.844
He's not good enough for you.

32:05.456 --> 32:08.425
Hey! Don't do that!

32:09.360 --> 32:10.486
Do what?

32:10.561 --> 32:12.893
"He's not good enough for you"?

32:14.332 --> 32:17.563
I don't want you saying things
like that to me, Lucas.

32:17.635 --> 32:21.731
That's not fair to me.
It's not fair to Lindsey, either.

32:48.433 --> 32:50.060
How does it feel?

32:51.202 --> 32:52.863
You know, before we opened,

32:52.937 --> 32:55.030
I could only think about
the displays and the catering,

32:55.106 --> 32:57.131
and then the crowd came in

32:57.208 --> 33:01.975
and I got to share what I do with
the people I love, and it was amazing.

33:03.281 --> 33:06.546
- Well, here is to a job well done.
- Thank you.

33:10.221 --> 33:14.351
- So, how did the store do?
- Let's find out.

33:21.299 --> 33:22.891
Well.

33:25.937 --> 33:28.667
We sold a couple scarves, some handbags.

33:29.107 --> 33:31.405
No gowns? A suit?

33:33.011 --> 33:34.342
Not even a dress?

33:35.380 --> 33:36.472
Well...

33:36.547 --> 33:40.074
No, I don't think you sold one
high-dollar piece all night.

33:40.151 --> 33:44.554
In fact, if you factor in the party expenses
and all the pieces you gave away,

33:44.622 --> 33:47.113
I believe your store has run
the biggest opening-day deficit

33:47.191 --> 33:48.658
in our company's history.

33:50.094 --> 33:53.530
At least it wasn't a complete disaster.
Where is she? You.

33:53.598 --> 33:56.533
Whatever your name is, pack up the
inventory and ship it to our Houston store.

33:56.601 --> 33:58.091
They're expecting it.

34:00.004 --> 34:03.940
They're expecting it?
You knew this was gonna happen?

34:04.275 --> 34:06.971
Darling, you've never had
a head for business.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.706
That's why I've tried
to protect you from it.

34:10.348 --> 34:13.748
High-end lines don't do well
in sleepy little towns.

34:13.818 --> 34:18.083
Beautiful things die in Tree Hill.
Why do you think we left?

34:21.426 --> 34:24.793
- I don't believe this.
- I know how much this meant to you.

34:25.196 --> 34:29.155
And if you had sold just one couture piece,

34:31.002 --> 34:35.803
I'd consider letting you keep the store.
But you didn't.

34:37.675 --> 34:41.839
Brooke? I'd like to buy this dress.

34:43.848 --> 34:44.974
No, it's too much.

34:45.049 --> 34:48.074
I think it's worth every cent
and I wanna pay for it.

34:48.619 --> 34:50.246
Oh, my goodness.

34:51.889 --> 34:54.050
I believe in you, Brooke.

34:54.125 --> 35:00.064
So, you see, I'm not just buying a dress,
what I'm buying is a whole lot more.

35:03.134 --> 35:04.931
This changes nothing.

35:12.810 --> 35:17.577
Our first real check.
I'm gonna have to frame this.

35:17.915 --> 35:20.349
But if you frame it, you can't cash...

35:20.952 --> 35:25.013
Oh. Oh, good.
'Cause it definitely would've bounced.

35:27.458 --> 35:28.447
Thank you.

Sorry. Hi.

35:57.655 --> 36:00.146
- Hey.
- Sounds great.

36:00.525 --> 36:02.322
You couldn't stay away either, huh?

36:03.327 --> 36:05.557
Honestly, I think I'm gonna throw up.

36:05.630 --> 36:07.860
- What if I'm not worth it?
- You are.

36:09.100 --> 36:13.264
I really believe that.
But you've gotta believe it, too, you know?

36:14.438 --> 36:15.530
Yeah.

36:16.941 --> 36:21.708
Oh, don't worry.
We'll face all of this tomorrow.

36:23.414 --> 36:27.282

- It goes back up to the D.

I'd love to see that dress on you.

37:07.792 --> 37:09.384
- Hey.
- Goodnight, Mama.

37:09.460 --> 37:12.793
Oh, you're going to bed already?
I haven't seen you all day.

37:12.863 --> 37:14.421
Oh, I missed you.

37:17.635 --> 37:20.229
Okay, go upstairs.
I'll be up in a minute, all right, bud?

37:20.538 --> 37:21.971
I just wanna talk with Carrie.

37:22.039 --> 37:24.803
Oh, okay, sure.
All right, buddy, you ready to go to bed?

37:25.209 --> 37:27.302
- All right.
- Night.

37:28.779 --> 37:32.681
- Is everything okay?
- Actually, everything's great.

37:32.750 --> 37:35.617
I'm getting back into music
and Nathan's healing.

37:35.686 --> 37:38.621
Jamie's never been happier.

37:39.457 --> 37:43.188
And most importantly, I'm actually
starting to feel like we're a family again.

37:43.527 --> 37:44.892
I'm glad to hear that.

37:44.962 --> 37:46.657
Well, you had a lot to do with it,

37:46.731 --> 37:52.601

already, I just... Thank you.

- Who's the guy?
- My gosh, are you jealous?

My private life is my own business.

he was completely boring.

Your place or mine?

39:22.159 --> 39:23.524
Hi.

39:25.162 --> 39:27.062
Brooke, what's wrong?

39:28.332 --> 39:33.497
- The store is a total failure.
- What are you talking about?

39:33.604 --> 39:35.469
I didn't sell one real piece tonight.

39:35.539 --> 39:39.771
Well, I sold a dress, but it was
a pity purchase and it doesn't count,

39:39.844 --> 39:43.177
and the worst part is that Victoria
saw this all coming.

39:45.316 --> 39:48.877
My mother's right, when I'm left up
to my own devices, I'm a failure.

39:48.953 --> 39:52.116
No, hey, listen to me.

39:52.189 --> 39:54.487
You were never a failure, okay?

39:55.593 --> 39:57.754
I mean, you won
three cheerleading competitions.

39:57.828 --> 40:00.160
And what did Victoria
have to say about that?

40:00.231 --> 40:02.222
Oh, wait, nothing, 'cause she wasn't there.

40:02.299 --> 40:05.029
She also wasn't there when you
won the Miss Junebug title

40:05.102 --> 40:06.797
at the county fair, now was she?

40:06.871 --> 40:09.704
Or when you were elected
student body president.

40:10.775 --> 40:13.300
Brooke, if you're a failure,
what does that make me?

40:15.813 --> 40:16.973
Pretty lame, I guess.

40:19.383 --> 40:23.012
Okay. I don't wanna talk about
my night anymore.

40:23.087 --> 40:28.047
