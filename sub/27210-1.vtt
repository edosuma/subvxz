00:24.894 --> 00:27.244
There's still
some key states

00:27.331 --> 00:29.681
that we need
to keep our eyes on.

00:29.768 --> 00:33.381
There's Michigan, Georgia,
Nevada, Iowa.

00:33.511 --> 00:35.252
None of these
states have been called.

00:39.604 --> 00:43.521
...at this hour, Donald Trump is
projected to win North Carolina.

00:43.608 --> 00:46.481
This is a reliably
Republican state,

00:46.568 --> 00:48.091
with the exception of 2008,

00:48.178 --> 00:50.441
when the state
voted for Obama.

01:00.321 --> 01:03.672
We just know that
we deserve to be in there,

01:03.759 --> 01:05.194
and not sitting out here.

01:05.674 --> 01:07.806
Hey, yo, listen. Y'all
know why my nickname is Rock?

01:07.893 --> 01:10.026
'Cause you can always
lean on me.

01:36.922 --> 01:39.142
Oh, shit. Listen, listen.

01:44.887 --> 01:48.499
We're gonna get drunk,
we're here to have a good time.

01:48.586 --> 01:50.588
You know what I'm sayin'?

01:50.675 --> 01:56.507
Listen, listen, what's the worst
Instagram account out there?

01:57.465 --> 01:58.596
Who?

01:58.901 --> 02:00.511
What's the funniest?

02:00.598 --> 02:03.601
I think that's 'cause
y'all need to see it.

02:03.688 --> 02:07.562
I got the best Instagram
account in the world.

02:11.783 --> 02:13.524
He's like a cornerstone.

02:13.611 --> 02:16.614
Yeah, I'm a cornerstone.

02:17.267 --> 02:19.530
Hey man, y'all ordering food
or what?

02:19.617 --> 02:21.141
You hungry?

02:21.228 --> 02:23.708
- You orderin' food?
- If you wanna eat.

02:23.795 --> 02:25.884
- What you wanna eat?
- Are they hungry?

02:25.971 --> 02:27.321
Man, don't worry about them.

02:27.408 --> 02:29.801
They in their salad days?
She needs a Coke.

02:29.888 --> 02:31.890
These LA girls, come on, man.
You already know.

02:31.977 --> 02:34.763
- She need a Coke.
- It's very cold.

02:34.850 --> 02:35.894
She's warm!

02:35.981 --> 02:37.418
Here, I got a warm heart.

02:37.505 --> 02:39.724
I can give you my
coat up until the door.

02:39.811 --> 02:40.638
Then I'm gettin' my coat back.

02:40.725 --> 02:42.292
I got a warm heart.

02:43.641 --> 02:45.121

up until the door,

02:45.208 --> 02:47.819

- Hey, hey.

02:47.906 --> 02:50.648
Go talk to him. Go talk to him.
Check this out.

02:50.735 --> 02:52.433
You-you about give up
your coat, for real?

02:52.520 --> 02:54.609
What are you,
like, Prince Charming now?

02:54.696 --> 02:58.090
Guess what? Guess what?
I'm gonna get it back.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.831
- This is some bullshit.
- Turn around.

02:59.918 --> 03:01.268
No, no.

03:01.355 --> 03:02.704
- Oh, damn, Rock!
- No.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.402
- It ain't happening? It ain't happening?
- Nope.

03:05.489 --> 03:07.535
- Nope. Nope.
- This party is fit tonight.

03:07.622 --> 03:09.276
This party is fit.

03:10.190 --> 03:13.149
You want me to
put your jacket on?

03:18.633 --> 03:20.374
I can't even get in there!

03:20.461 --> 03:22.506
You just gotta throw it
over my shoulders.

03:22.593 --> 03:24.508
Bootsy Collins!
Yo, Bootsy Collins!

03:28.077 --> 03:29.861
All right, let me get
my jacket back though.

03:30.166 --> 03:31.559
- Somebody might drive by and see me.
- Yeah, that's true.

03:31.646 --> 03:33.691
Yeah, let me
get my jacket back.

03:33.778 --> 03:36.259
When are we getting
in this place, though?

03:36.346 --> 03:37.782
People know me,
you know what I'm saying?

03:37.869 --> 03:39.958
- Free!
Can't be doing that.

03:40.045 --> 03:41.133
Yeah, come on.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.310
Yup, yup, yup!

03:45.573 --> 03:47.357
Thank you!

03:50.926 --> 03:52.710
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

03:56.758 --> 03:58.847
You in a rush?
Where you trying to go?

03:58.934 --> 04:01.371
So, are you ready

04:01.458 --> 04:05.506
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready. Let's do this.

04:05.593 --> 04:08.813
Why are we waiting?
Like, let's do this.

04:08.900 --> 04:12.513

Why you in a rush?

04:28.398 --> 04:30.487
I mean, yeah. I'm good.

04:32.576 --> 04:34.317
This is really good.

04:34.448 --> 04:37.494
I bet. I've never
seen you before.

04:38.582 --> 04:41.106
What, you know

04:41.193 --> 04:43.065
Something like that.

04:43.195 --> 04:43.500
Oh.

04:53.902 --> 04:55.295
Where'd you go?

04:56.861 --> 04:59.603
Across the street to that bar.

05:00.343 --> 05:02.476
'Cause I don't like the lines.

05:02.563 --> 05:04.826
Oh, we don't do the lines.

05:06.262 --> 05:08.743
Just tellin' my new friend
that we don't do lines.

05:08.830 --> 05:10.527
What up, Miss Lady?
How you doin'?

05:10.614 --> 05:12.877

We're good.

05:17.752 --> 05:18.056
We?

05:19.667 --> 05:21.538
Thought it was just you.

You got Cass' jacket.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.066
You look good, though.

06:11.153 --> 06:14.156
You know why you look good?
You don't need a jacket.

06:14.243 --> 06:17.986
- She don't need a jacket 'cause she look good?
- Nope. 'Cause she look good.

06:18.073 --> 06:21.163
Listen, if you had my jacket--
Look, Cass...

06:21.250 --> 06:23.513
I swear to God,

Hey Rock, hold up for

11:49.273 --> 11:50.797

11:50.884 --> 11:52.581
I'm good, yeah, I'm good.

Why you bein' like that?

11:54.148 --> 11:56.498
I'm just-just chillin',
enjoying the vibe.

11:56.585 --> 11:58.369
I mean, you could come
chill with me, though.

11:58.456 --> 12:01.808
- I'm good. Thank you.
- Oh, OK. You too good, OK.

12:01.895 --> 12:04.462

No, she just sitting over there.

12:08.162 --> 12:10.817

You know what I'm saying?

12:58.299 --> 13:00.301
All right, whatever.
Hey, here!

13:00.388 --> 13:02.346

13:10.006 --> 13:11.878
I'll take that.

13:11.965 --> 13:14.358

13:18.493 --> 13:20.538
Hey!

13:20.625 --> 13:22.453

There it is!

13:22.540 --> 13:25.326
That's the hardest--
Hey, don't worry about me.

13:25.413 --> 13:27.284
Don't worry about me.
Y'all ready for this?

13:27.371 --> 13:28.590

You might wanna watch out.

13:39.122 --> 13:42.343

14:06.715 --> 14:08.717
I was just doing my job.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.763
Of course. Just doing your job.

14:12.677 --> 14:15.202

14:15.289 --> 14:18.727

14:29.216 --> 14:31.871
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.743
What are you doing? Stop!
What are you doing?

16:01.830 --> 16:02.396
Fuck!

16:32.295 --> 16:36.082
Yo, yo. Yo, Rock!

16:38.258 --> 16:40.390
-Yo here.
-Yo, I don't want that.
Where'd she go?

16:40.477 --> 16:40.956
Who?

16:52.228 --> 16:55.492
Listen,

17:30.310 --> 17:32.486
Hey, hey, hey. Yo, yo.

17:35.097 --> 17:37.969
Hey. Hey, hey!
Yo, slow down, slow down!

17:38.057 --> 17:39.275
Is that what you do?

17:39.362 --> 17:39.667
I--

17:41.321 --> 17:44.106
Look, I wasn't trying
to hurt you.

17:44.193 --> 17:46.195
- You didn't hurt me.
- You look hurt!

17:46.282 --> 17:50.417
You know what, you track...
That's fine. That's fine.

17:50.504 --> 17:54.899
I'm getting ready to go anyways.
Thank you for everything.

17:54.986 --> 17:57.250
We can't leave.
You just got here!

17:57.337 --> 18:00.166
I have to go anyway, I have a flight
to catch in the morning, so...

18:00.253 --> 18:02.516
You got a flight, all right.

18:02.603 --> 18:04.909
- A flight? A flight?
- Yeah, I'm going back home.

18:07.042 --> 18:10.350
Oh. All right.
So you're not from here? Okay.

18:10.437 --> 18:13.788
Yeah, all right. Whatever.
I mean, what are you gonna do?

18:13.875 --> 18:15.268
What do you mean,
what am I gonna do?

18:15.355 --> 18:16.747
What you gonna do, you just--

18:16.834 --> 18:20.751
It's LA, there's taxis
everywhere. I'll manage.

18:23.189 --> 18:23.711
So...

18:25.278 --> 18:27.802
does that mean you just go back
to the lame-ass Midwest,

18:27.889 --> 18:29.804

You a Midwest girl?

18:29.891 --> 18:32.981
Oh. Says the 30-something
year-old promoter

18:33.068 --> 18:35.897

I guess?

18:36.027 --> 18:37.855
Yeah, the one who knows

18:37.942 --> 18:40.423
- So that's what... you goin' there with that?

18:42.599 --> 18:45.472
Girl, I run this town. You lucky
I got your ass in the club.

18:45.559 --> 18:48.475
You were sittin' on the curb,
I got you in the club.

18:48.562 --> 18:49.432
Fuck you!

18:50.041 --> 18:51.956

19:01.009 --> 19:02.750
You know what else?

19:09.931 --> 19:10.714
Fuck...

19:15.371 --> 19:15.937
Shit.

Bullshit, I fucking

Oh, shit!

20:02.505 --> 20:04.812
Yo, yo! Hey!

20:04.899 --> 20:07.380
- Chill, chill.

20:07.467 --> 20:08.859
Who the fuck do you
think you are?!

20:08.946 --> 20:12.472
Who do you think you are?
Go on, man.

20:12.602 --> 20:15.736

20:21.002 --> 20:22.482

20:22.569 --> 20:25.920
Show me your hands!
Show me your hands!

20:26.050 --> 20:27.704
- This dude right here!
- Ma'am, stand back.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.706
- Stand back!
- No! It's not him!

20:29.793 --> 20:31.969
- Okay!
- It's not him, though, it was them!

20:32.056 --> 20:36.060
- Why are you going after him?
- Torres! Torres!

20:36.191 --> 20:36.974
Torres!

20:37.888 --> 20:40.369
The girl says the guys running
attacked her.

20:40.456 --> 20:43.242
Come on, man.

20:43.329 --> 20:46.070
Tell me what happened.
Tell me what happened.

20:46.157 --> 20:48.116
Those guys came up to me
they were trying to hit on me,

20:48.203 --> 20:51.075
they were getting, like,
touchy-grabby, my boy came up,

20:51.162 --> 20:53.904
and he told them, like,
to back up. The dude pushed him.

20:53.991 --> 20:59.388
So when he pushed him, like,
the dude was aggressive first.

20:59.823 --> 21:03.697
- Let's go.
- Come on, man.

21:34.728 --> 21:36.469
- Are you Cass?
- No.

21:37.252 --> 21:39.298
Cass Film, that is you, bro!

21:39.385 --> 21:41.082
Either you or your twin!

21:41.169 --> 21:43.519
- Yo, what happened? You all right?
- Yeah, what's up?

21:43.606 --> 21:46.305
Look, I go to USC.
I got one more year left.

21:46.392 --> 21:48.959
And I promise you,
your film was everything.

21:49.046 --> 21:51.266
You know they still show it
there, right?

21:51.353 --> 21:52.963
So, what's up?

21:53.094 --> 21:57.490
When the feature supposed to
drop, man? We all waitin'!

21:57.577 --> 22:01.015
You look like a bright kid, man.

22:13.114 --> 22:13.549
Hey.

22:15.508 --> 22:15.943
Hey.

22:19.947 --> 22:22.384

- Nothing.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.952
- Yo!

22:25.082 --> 22:30.044
No, I just-- I heard about,
you did a film or something?

22:30.871 --> 22:32.481
- Can I see it?
- No.

22:33.395 --> 22:35.441
- Why not?

22:36.006 --> 22:38.139
Look, I'm gonna go back in there

22:38.226 --> 22:40.228
You can stay with him if you want,
he'll take care of you, all right?

22:40.315 --> 22:44.493
I'm not-- No, come here,
come here, come here.

22:45.364 --> 22:45.799
Hey.

22:49.237 --> 22:49.803
What?

22:53.415 --> 22:54.373
Come here.

23:02.293 --> 23:03.643
Come sit down.

23:03.991 --> 23:06.515
Let's just sit for a minute.

23:08.996 --> 23:11.433
Let's just sit down. Come on.

24:02.528 --> 24:03.093
Shit.

24:19.588 --> 24:20.154
Um...

24:23.113 --> 24:25.115
I'm sorry about before.

24:25.246 --> 24:25.855
What?

24:26.290 --> 24:29.163
I said, I'm sorry about before.

24:30.077 --> 24:31.687
You're sorry, what?

24:31.774 --> 24:36.170
I said, I'm sorry about before.
In the bathroom.

24:39.347 --> 24:40.130
It's OK.

24:43.090 --> 24:43.525
Hey.

24:45.266 --> 24:46.049
It's OK.

24:52.795 --> 24:55.755
Yeah, you just pulled up right
in front of me.

24:55.842 --> 24:56.843
Where...?

24:57.278 --> 25:00.803
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Where are you going?

25:01.848 --> 25:03.589
Anywhere but here.

25:06.374 --> 25:07.593
You walkin'?

25:09.943 --> 25:10.813
Let's go.

25:34.750 --> 25:36.317
How you all doing?

25:36.447 --> 25:38.232
Oh, man, OK.

25:39.581 --> 25:41.801
It's been a tough night.

25:55.292 --> 25:56.293
Thank you.

25:59.601 --> 26:00.515
For what?

26:04.911 --> 26:07.870
That was, uh...
that was cute.

26:10.830 --> 26:12.135
- Cute?
- Yeah.

26:13.354 --> 26:15.530
I'm a grown-ass man, woman.

26:15.617 --> 26:18.577
Does that mean
you can't be cute?

26:31.285 --> 26:33.766
Home to Detroit, Michigan,

26:33.853 --> 26:36.246
Milwaukee and Wisconsin.

26:37.813 --> 26:40.729
It could impede in what
the polls are saying right now.

26:40.816 --> 26:42.992
Michigan and Wisconsin
are so close.

26:43.079 --> 26:45.778
Um, just a really quick update
right now,

26:45.865 --> 26:49.956
we have Hillary with New Mexico,
Virginia, Colorado, Oregon--

26:52.132 --> 26:54.308
These are all
no surprises:

26:54.395 --> 26:56.615
Hawaii, California,

27:08.061 --> 27:10.803
Thank you for fighting for me.

27:11.934 --> 27:12.892
Thank you.

27:14.589 --> 27:16.156
You're welcome.

27:17.461 --> 27:19.202
The least I could do.

27:22.945 --> 27:24.381
We did not expect this race

27:24.468 --> 27:27.820
to be this close,
that is for sure.

27:27.950 --> 27:29.648
Brother, you need
some napkins?

27:29.735 --> 27:30.997
I have napkins up here.

27:31.084 --> 27:31.954
I'm fine.

27:34.435 --> 27:36.132
What happened?

27:36.219 --> 27:37.351
Ignorance.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.571
That's what happened.
Let's just...

27:40.659 --> 27:42.878
We don't need
to talk about it.

27:42.965 --> 27:45.925
I know all about that one.

27:46.055 --> 27:48.928
What you mean,
you know about all that?

27:49.015 --> 27:51.670
What you know about all what?

27:53.759 --> 27:57.327
My dad is Arabic.
I was raised Muslim, man.

27:57.458 --> 27:59.678
I deal with it every day.

28:01.201 --> 28:02.985
The Arabic part helps you out.

28:03.072 --> 28:04.857
Hmm! Does it?

28:04.987 --> 28:05.814
Trust me.

28:07.076 --> 28:08.991
Yeah, tell that
to my fam, bro.

28:09.078 --> 28:12.299
Yeah, you can't know what's it
like to wake up every...

28:12.386 --> 28:14.127
every day, over and
over and over,

28:14.214 --> 28:17.608
they disrespect you just because
of the color you were born in.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.523
I ain't disrespectin' you.

28:19.610 --> 28:20.742
I'm tellin' you.

28:20.829 --> 28:23.353
The Arabic side helps you out.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.312
Black man in America,

28:25.399 --> 28:28.619
you gotta wake up and act like
the shit didn't happen.

28:28.707 --> 28:31.144
So you can't know about it.

28:33.276 --> 28:35.714
Man, my mom's black.

28:38.760 --> 28:43.069
Try being a black man in America
every day, and then, uh..

28:43.156 --> 28:45.985
being put on a terrorist list.

28:46.072 --> 28:50.685
Your, uh, dad being stopped
for no reason, and, uh,

28:51.555 --> 28:55.298
your cousins not being
able to come here.

28:57.953 --> 29:01.478
It's like being
a black man in America.

29:05.526 --> 29:07.267
This shit ain't OK.

29:08.094 --> 29:09.922
Shit ain't OK, man.

29:10.009 --> 29:12.359
No, the fuckin' shit ain't OK.

29:12.446 --> 29:12.881
Hey.

29:16.450 --> 29:17.756
Shit is not OK.

29:19.148 --> 29:20.541
It's fucked up.

29:21.629 --> 29:23.370
But you know what,
it's different.

29:23.457 --> 29:25.024
It's different for you,
it's different for him,

29:25.111 --> 29:27.200
it's different for me.

29:28.462 --> 29:29.942
It's fucked up.

29:32.074 --> 29:32.509
God.

29:35.121 --> 29:36.687
Especially now.

29:41.344 --> 29:43.216
It's fucking crazy.

29:44.521 --> 29:47.307
Donald Trump
has always had money.

29:47.394 --> 29:50.440
Do you think-- Listen,
people who are voting for him--

29:50.527 --> 29:53.443
This is for the voters:
he has always had money.

29:53.530 --> 29:56.751
He has never even known
anybody that is poor,

29:56.838 --> 30:00.929
that's middle-class,
that's working class--

30:01.060 --> 30:01.712
You OK?

30:04.846 --> 30:05.760
I'm fine.

30:09.111 --> 30:12.071
I mean, not really,
but I'm fine.

30:16.553 --> 30:18.207
Just tired as shit.

30:19.730 --> 30:21.080
Same old shit.

30:21.602 --> 30:23.996
Every city, same old shit.

30:29.697 --> 30:30.263
Yeah.

30:35.224 --> 30:37.183
- Yeah.
- And he only cares now

30:37.270 --> 30:39.576
because he wants your vote.

30:39.707 --> 30:41.796
And if he wins tonight,

30:42.536 --> 30:45.669
because of you, you're going
to find out very soon

30:45.756 --> 30:48.847
that his interests
are not yours.

30:51.937 --> 30:53.329
Welcome to L.A.

30:55.766 --> 30:58.204
Shit. Welcome to America.

30:59.118 --> 31:00.554
Yeah, that too.

31:11.957 --> 31:13.523
Trump began
his unlikely bid

31:13.610 --> 31:16.700
to the White House
in June 2015...

31:18.224 --> 31:19.703
What do you want?

31:21.836 --> 31:22.402
What?

31:23.490 --> 31:27.189
What do you want?
Like, what do you really want?

31:27.276 --> 31:27.842
Uh...

31:29.539 --> 31:32.760
I mean, does it really matter,
what I really want?

31:32.847 --> 31:35.284
It's not the movies, so...

31:36.068 --> 31:36.633
What?

31:38.374 --> 31:42.683
I mean, nobody ever gets
what they really want.

31:43.423 --> 31:44.337
Says who?

31:45.686 --> 31:47.775
Who told you that? Society?

31:47.862 --> 31:51.083
Nah, man, it's just there's...

31:51.213 --> 31:53.694
things that I know, and that's
one thing that I know.

31:53.781 --> 31:57.916
And I ask again,
who told you that?

31:58.960 --> 32:00.048
Everybody.

32:01.310 --> 32:03.791
My mom, my sisters, my dad.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.619
I mean, literally everybody.

32:05.706 --> 32:07.099
Yeah, but you said
you were grown.

32:07.186 --> 32:07.795
No. OK.

32:08.578 --> 32:11.581
I am grown.
Let me put it this way.

32:12.104 --> 32:15.107
My mom... she had things
that she wanted to do.

32:15.194 --> 32:18.414
Things that she
was excited about.

32:18.762 --> 32:19.894
She had kids

32:20.286 --> 32:21.200
and then,

32:21.548 --> 32:23.115
we came along and

32:23.724 --> 32:26.509
she ain't get to
do those things.

32:26.640 --> 32:29.425
So, how am I supposed to be
just completely irresponsible

32:29.512 --> 32:30.905
and just go after

32:30.992 --> 32:32.689
something that's crazy, like...

32:32.776 --> 32:33.516
Just...

32:34.256 --> 32:35.649
- Crazy?
- How can you do that?

32:35.736 --> 32:36.867
Yes, crazy.

32:38.913 --> 32:40.219
OK, so what...

32:41.785 --> 32:43.744
What did you go after?

32:47.139 --> 32:48.357
I'm a lawyer.

32:50.229 --> 32:51.447
That's nice.

32:58.628 --> 33:00.152
You hate it, huh?

33:03.242 --> 33:05.157
That why you rockin'
the short crop

33:05.244 --> 33:06.897
with the blond hair at the top?

33:06.985 --> 33:08.943
- 'Cause you being rebellious?
- Nah.

33:09.030 --> 33:11.467
Everybody needs a change.

33:14.470 --> 33:16.168
Even lawyers, huh?

33:18.344 --> 33:19.649
Even lawyers.

33:25.046 --> 33:27.353
What's that look?

33:28.093 --> 33:29.485
It's nothing.

33:29.572 --> 33:32.532
No, it's something.
I mean, it's...

33:32.619 --> 33:34.664
It's like it's different.
Like it changed.

33:34.751 --> 33:35.926
What's that look?

33:36.014 --> 33:37.493
I said it's fine.

33:39.800 --> 33:42.890
No, I'm saying it's different.
Like, I'm, you know...

33:42.977 --> 33:44.370
I'm a film director, so I--

33:44.457 --> 33:46.502
OK, could you just
leave it alone, please?

33:46.589 --> 33:48.113
I said it's fine.

33:51.029 --> 33:51.681
My bad.

33:54.771 --> 33:56.425
I make good money.

33:56.556 --> 33:58.862
I own a condo and I'm able
to take care of my mom,

33:58.949 --> 34:01.604
and she's the one
who supported all of us.

34:01.691 --> 34:03.041
I'm good. I...

34:03.867 --> 34:04.781
OK, so...

34:06.522 --> 34:10.091
You got money in the bank.
That's dope.

34:10.570 --> 34:12.746
What do you mean by that?

34:13.529 --> 34:15.531
Like I said, it's dope.

34:15.661 --> 34:18.534
You still didn't answer
my question, though.

34:18.621 --> 34:20.145
Yes, I did.

34:20.275 --> 34:21.797
No, you didn't. I asked you
what you really want.

34:21.885 --> 34:26.020
And I said nobody ever gets
what they really want.

34:36.117 --> 34:37.771
That ain't my life.

34:38.728 --> 34:39.077
Oh.

34:41.469 --> 34:43.472
So, what? What, you went
after the dream?

34:43.559 --> 34:45.474
You went after what
you really wanted, so...

34:45.561 --> 34:46.822
- Yeah
- I mean, what now?

34:46.909 --> 34:48.434
I'm going after mine.

34:48.521 --> 34:49.696
What you mean, "what now?"
I'm going after mine.

34:49.783 --> 34:50.565
Are you?

34:51.263 --> 34:51.828
Yeah.

34:53.395 --> 34:53.960
What?

34:55.484 --> 34:56.355
Nothing.

34:57.573 --> 34:58.661
Hmm.

35:07.409 --> 35:10.064
What do you really want to be?

35:11.674 --> 35:12.022
I--

35:13.546 --> 35:15.852
Go ahead. I'm listening.

35:18.246 --> 35:18.812
Uh...

35:21.771 --> 35:23.164
At one point...

35:24.034 --> 35:25.688
I wanted to be a DJ.

35:27.734 --> 35:30.345
You made me laugh.

35:30.476 --> 35:34.262
- I made you laugh?
- No, I mean, in a good way.

35:34.349 --> 35:35.568
That's cool.

35:36.046 --> 35:38.005
- Word. A DJ.
- Like...

35:39.006 --> 35:41.356
No, seriously though, like...

35:41.443 --> 35:44.490
At all of my, like, little get-togethers
with my family and stuff,

35:44.577 --> 35:46.361
I like to pull out
my Bluetooth speaker,

35:46.448 --> 35:47.971
and like... I don't know.

35:48.058 --> 35:50.104
- Like what?
- Just...

35:50.235 --> 35:53.281
- Like what?
- Make people feel something.

35:53.368 --> 35:54.369
You know?

35:54.500 --> 35:55.457
Move them.

35:57.024 --> 35:58.591
Make them think.

35:59.200 --> 36:02.377
Or just have fun
for a little while.

36:03.073 --> 36:05.163
Music does that for me.

36:06.076 --> 36:08.209
Film does that for me.

36:11.299 --> 36:12.082
Touché.

36:15.912 --> 36:18.480
Well...
I don't know, you got...

36:18.567 --> 36:20.178
a playlist? Spotify?

36:20.265 --> 36:21.614
What?

36:22.005 --> 36:23.050
Come on, you're old-school.
You got a mix-tape, right?

36:23.137 --> 36:23.703
What?

36:25.183 --> 36:27.010
- Nah, man.
- Yo, Naqeeb!

36:27.097 --> 36:28.838
- That's your name, right?
- Yeah.

36:28.925 --> 36:29.491
Um...

36:30.884 --> 36:32.059
We got a DJ back here.

36:32.146 --> 36:33.147
- Word?
- Yo.

36:33.234 --> 36:34.627
- Yo!
- She got a mix-tape.

36:34.714 --> 36:36.455
I do not have a mix-tape!

36:36.542 --> 36:38.152
Let me--
Let me hear it!

36:38.239 --> 36:41.764
I know you got headphones in
that purse, too. Come on.

36:41.851 --> 36:43.810
Once a DJ, always a DJ.

36:44.332 --> 36:45.290
Let it rip.

36:48.206 --> 36:49.772
- Hold that.
- OK.

36:53.559 --> 36:54.560
All right.

36:55.691 --> 36:58.955
These things don't usually
do well with my ears.

36:59.042 --> 37:00.566
- Well...
- I got little ears, but...

37:00.653 --> 37:02.655
- Do you?
- Yeah, I do got little ears,

37:02.742 --> 37:05.484
but hopefully your music
is big.

37:05.614 --> 37:06.963
Oh, God...

37:07.312 --> 37:09.183
- OK.
- All right. Let me know what you think.

37:09.270 --> 37:09.923
I'm in.

37:10.315 --> 37:12.230
- You're in?
- I'm in.

37:14.057 --> 37:16.843
You go to the song
you want me to...

37:16.930 --> 37:18.366
Uh... That one.

37:19.411 --> 37:20.499
There we go.

37:23.197 --> 37:24.111
For real?

37:26.244 --> 37:27.157
For real?

37:31.684 --> 37:31.988
Yo!

37:34.643 --> 37:35.383
Lawyer?

37:36.254 --> 37:37.255
Whatever.

37:39.213 --> 37:39.779
Damn!

37:43.826 --> 37:45.828
What's your DJ name?

37:45.959 --> 37:46.525
What?

37:47.569 --> 37:49.441
I ain't got a DJ name.

37:50.703 --> 37:52.270
Yo, this is hot!

37:58.885 --> 38:01.844
Your mama know
you're this good?

38:02.062 --> 38:02.976
Exactly.

38:14.596 --> 38:14.901
Yo.

38:23.910 --> 38:24.998
Hmm.

38:31.047 --> 38:34.268
- Yeah, this is it, man.
- OK.

38:34.399 --> 38:35.617
That's good.

38:42.232 --> 38:44.626
That's dope.

38:44.713 --> 38:45.279
Yeah?

38:47.716 --> 38:48.674
What's up?

38:50.676 --> 38:52.982
What? You didn't like it?

38:55.289 --> 38:58.031
Nah, it's incredible.

39:16.745 --> 39:19.748
No, I mean, it was
incredible. Honestly.

39:19.835 --> 39:21.533
I just, you know...

39:22.621 --> 39:24.579
- My phone.
- I real-- Yeah.

39:24.666 --> 39:26.451
- Right.
- You got a whole life back home,

39:26.538 --> 39:29.062
and, look,
this is borrowed time.

39:29.149 --> 39:32.457
OK... Look, I'm not
with him anymore.

39:32.587 --> 39:34.676
It's-- It's none of
my business.

39:34.763 --> 39:37.810
Oh, so you're not
seeing someone?

39:38.637 --> 39:40.334
Yeah, I'm seeing everyone.

39:40.421 --> 39:44.382
Oh, come on, man, don't be
like that. I saw you earlier.

39:44.469 --> 39:46.471
I saw you on your phone
when I was walking up,

39:46.558 --> 39:49.082
and you sounded like
you were all in love.

39:49.169 --> 39:49.735
Yeah.

39:50.649 --> 39:53.391
What? Now you don't remember?

39:55.262 --> 39:55.871
Oh, OK.

39:56.785 --> 39:59.397
But it's funny when you do it.

39:59.788 --> 40:00.354
Rumi.

40:02.400 --> 40:05.664
Rumi is my son.
He's five years old.

40:06.534 --> 40:06.839
Oh.

40:08.754 --> 40:11.321
Look, I understand that--

40:11.452 --> 40:15.064
No, I don't think
you do understand.

40:15.195 --> 40:18.285
You fought for me
the first day we met.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.418
And he's only ever...

40:21.157 --> 40:22.202
fought me.

40:22.985 --> 40:27.555
And he's only fighting
for me now because I'm gone.

40:45.747 --> 40:47.706
Oh, my God, that view.

40:49.621 --> 40:50.839
Look at this.

40:53.625 --> 40:54.060
Ohh!

41:11.251 --> 41:12.252
So pretty.

41:22.392 --> 41:26.135
- It's so quiet up here, eh?
- Yeah.

41:28.616 --> 41:29.574
Thank you.

41:33.273 --> 41:33.708
Hmm.

41:39.192 --> 41:40.585
Look up.

41:44.284 --> 41:45.938
Oh, my God.

41:47.766 --> 41:49.332
It's a full moon.

41:49.681 --> 41:50.943
Shit.

41:51.247 --> 41:54.120
Like a record.

41:55.469 --> 41:56.035
Yeah.

41:57.950 --> 41:59.125
Maybe it's a sign.

41:59.212 --> 42:01.431
Maybe it is a sign.

42:05.958 --> 42:06.393
Hmm.

42:06.915 --> 42:08.438
God likes music too.

42:08.526 --> 42:11.311
Oh, God loves music.

42:26.631 --> 42:28.415
Wait. Where are we?

42:30.678 --> 42:32.593
A friend's house.

42:32.680 --> 42:35.335
Find ourselves here a lot.

42:35.465 --> 42:37.511
After these kind of nights,
you know?

42:37.598 --> 42:39.252
Mm-hmm.

42:39.382 --> 42:41.820
Let's go check it out.

42:41.907 --> 42:44.213
- Let's do it.
- OK.

42:55.790 --> 42:56.748
Ah.

43:04.103 --> 43:06.061
Oh, thank you.

43:17.116 --> 43:18.465
This is it.

43:18.552 --> 43:19.988
Let's go in. Oh!

43:28.127 --> 43:29.955
Uh, anybody in here?

43:31.347 --> 43:34.916
- Hey, what's up, Cass?
- You got it.

43:35.047 --> 43:36.962
What's good with it?

43:37.049 --> 43:38.703
- You all right?
- All good, man.

43:38.790 --> 43:40.052
This is Free.

43:40.139 --> 43:43.011
How you doing?
Nice to meet you too.

43:44.752 --> 43:46.885
Donald Trump
absolutely needed it.

43:46.972 --> 43:48.626
He got it and now,
as we talked about,

43:48.713 --> 43:52.107
he has many different ways
to get to the 270 votes he needs

43:52.194 --> 43:55.807
to be the next
President of the United States.

43:55.894 --> 43:57.460
Clinton County had a surge

43:57.547 --> 43:59.332
of Latino voters
in the state of Florida.

43:59.419 --> 44:02.204
Looks like they actually did get
an increase in Latino turnout,

44:02.291 --> 44:03.902
but it wasn't enough.

44:03.989 --> 44:05.338
In Wisconsin
and, earlier in the night,

44:05.425 --> 44:07.906
Michigan was blue,
and now they're undecided

44:07.993 --> 44:09.211
and they're leaning
towards Trump

44:09.298 --> 44:11.126
and so, that's a big upset,

44:11.213 --> 44:14.347
stating that,
you know, Michigan...

44:14.477 --> 44:18.220
Uh... I didn't expect
for this to be so...

44:23.138 --> 44:24.792
Hey, guys.

44:27.316 --> 44:30.580
But, thing is, if he keeps
winning this, mathematically,

44:30.668 --> 44:32.408
she can't beat this shit out!

44:32.495 --> 44:35.803
But she-- He can't win.
I mean that-- I mean...

44:35.890 --> 44:37.065
Come on.

44:37.196 --> 44:39.372
But I mean, if they--
Who didn't vote?

44:39.459 --> 44:43.593
Like, who sat at home and
skipped out on this election?

44:43.681 --> 44:45.030
'Cause I voted.

44:45.117 --> 44:47.685
You're right. We all voted.

44:48.468 --> 44:52.864
If she loses Pennsylvania,
it's a fucking wrap.

44:54.126 --> 44:57.259
Radio silence in Brooklyn
right now at Clinton's party.

44:57.346 --> 45:00.480
A place that was jubilant
and excited just hours ago,

45:00.567 --> 45:02.482
now you can hear a pin drop.

45:02.569 --> 45:04.614
That is not a good sign
for the Clinton camp.

45:04.702 --> 45:07.008
I can only imagine
the devastation

45:07.095 --> 45:11.360
going through Hillary Clinton's
mind right now...

45:23.633 --> 45:25.374
We can leave if you want,
you know.

45:25.461 --> 45:26.898
No, no, it's OK.

45:27.681 --> 45:29.030
- Sure?
- Yeah.

45:29.422 --> 45:33.208
All right. I'm gonna go...
make us a drink.

45:33.339 --> 45:34.732
- OK
- All right.

45:36.995 --> 45:40.694
- Whiskey? Wine?
- Wine. Something. Champagne.

45:40.781 --> 45:42.130
We just heard
the list of states

45:42.217 --> 45:43.784
where Hillary Clinton
would have to win

45:43.871 --> 45:47.353
all those states
to have any chance...

45:47.832 --> 45:48.789
What's up?

45:50.138 --> 45:51.661
Good to see y'all, man.

45:51.749 --> 45:53.402
- What's up, man?
- Got it.

45:53.489 --> 45:54.708
What's up, K?

45:54.795 --> 45:56.231
- Good to see you, my man.
- You good?

45:56.318 --> 45:57.667
You know.

45:57.798 --> 45:59.582
- All right.
- You know. I'm hanging in there.

45:59.669 --> 46:01.236
- Hello.
- Hey.

46:01.323 --> 46:02.455
Thanks for inviting us.

46:02.542 --> 46:04.152
Of course!
Wait, that ain't me.

46:04.239 --> 46:06.459
Russell invited y'all.

46:11.464 --> 46:12.813
You're not drinking?

46:12.900 --> 46:14.772
I had a little bit.

46:14.902 --> 46:16.686
Now, I'm having
a little bit more.

46:16.774 --> 46:18.427
That's a lot more.

46:25.391 --> 46:26.566
Some big news here.

46:26.653 --> 46:28.263
Huge news.
The AP now projecting

46:28.350 --> 46:31.397
that Donald Trump has won
the state of Pennsylvania.

46:31.484 --> 46:33.703
This is a breaking announcement

46:33.791 --> 46:36.619
- from the Associated Press that cannot be underestimated.
- It's over!

46:36.706 --> 46:40.580
This is 20 more electoral votes
for Donald Trump.

46:40.667 --> 46:42.234
All the pundits--

46:42.321 --> 46:44.323
This is breaking
everyone's expectation--

46:44.410 --> 46:47.282
Honestly, I never thought that
that would happen...

46:56.552 --> 47:00.034
Hey. How've you been?
Good to see you.

47:00.165 --> 47:02.080
I can't believe what's
going on right now.

47:02.167 --> 47:03.603
Crazy, right?

47:59.789 --> 48:02.531
I'm gonna start throwing
parties out here and be done.

48:02.618 --> 48:03.881
This is crazy!

48:03.968 --> 48:05.970
It's fucking crazy!

48:12.454 --> 48:15.631
What is happening
is so crazy!

48:38.872 --> 48:40.395
We need to see this,
though.

48:40.482 --> 48:42.441
Cass, what the fuck
is your girl doing?

48:42.528 --> 48:44.660
- Wait, what's
- Turn it back on!

48:44.747 --> 48:46.967
Wait, wait, wait.

48:47.054 --> 48:50.275
- Can you turn back on the TV?
- Listen, listen, listen, like,

48:50.362 --> 48:51.841
I know we're all
watching this right now,

48:51.929 --> 48:53.756
I know we're all caught up
in this right now,

48:53.843 --> 48:56.368
but I think like, we just
need to take a moment.

48:56.455 --> 48:57.891
We just need to feel good,
like--

48:57.978 --> 48:59.240
It's the election
though!

48:59.327 --> 49:00.981
This is fucking crazy.
I know! I know!

49:01.068 --> 49:02.504
But we need a minute, y'all!

49:02.591 --> 49:04.332
We need a minute to feel good.

49:04.419 --> 49:05.812
We want to watch history...

49:05.899 --> 49:07.379
But we don't need
to watch this history.

49:07.466 --> 49:08.946
We need to think
about our history.

49:09.033 --> 49:11.209
We need to think about life,
we need to just...

49:11.296 --> 49:13.080
- feel good, y'all.
- But I am thinking about--

49:13.167 --> 49:14.734
Hey, yo! Hold on.

49:14.864 --> 49:17.432
- Give her a second.
- This is consuming us.

49:17.519 --> 49:20.044
Ma, go do your thing. Do your
thing. Play your-- Play your...

49:20.131 --> 49:21.741
Thank you.

49:27.573 --> 49:30.141
Yeah, I hate it. Hey Cass!
Come get her, man!

49:30.228 --> 49:31.925
Hey, come on, man.

49:35.929 --> 49:37.409
Get out of here!

49:44.459 --> 49:46.200
Turn the TV back on.

49:48.986 --> 49:52.467
Grab her. Grab her.
Dance with her.

49:54.774 --> 49:56.384
Just dance. Just da-- Hey!

49:56.471 --> 49:59.083
Hey! Just dance. Grab her.

49:59.213 --> 50:00.649
Whatever, I mean...

50:00.736 --> 50:04.001
The world is not
dancing, man.

50:07.439 --> 50:10.355
- Might as well, you know?
- I know. Hell. Yeah.

50:10.442 --> 50:12.096
Watch your drink.

50:14.141 --> 50:15.490
It is, but I mean, you know,

50:15.577 --> 50:17.101
it's not the end
of the world, y'all.

50:17.188 --> 50:19.494
It is
the end of the world!

50:25.283 --> 50:26.762
Cass!

50:33.117 --> 50:34.205
It's good.

50:34.509 --> 50:37.077
It's good what you did.
Hey, hey, hey.

50:37.164 --> 50:38.905
Really! Don't worry about it.

50:38.992 --> 50:40.254
You did good.

50:40.602 --> 50:42.735
You see,
they're hugging each other.

50:42.822 --> 50:43.388
Yeah.

50:46.130 --> 50:48.349
They're dancing. Look.

50:50.873 --> 50:52.179
He's dancing.

50:59.273 --> 51:00.144
You good?

51:02.276 --> 51:03.234
All right.

51:10.980 --> 51:11.633
Sorry!

51:16.421 --> 51:17.987
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey, hey, hey.

51:18.075 --> 51:20.294
Don't worry about it.
Come on. Let's go outside.

51:20.381 --> 51:22.035
Come on, let's go.

51:23.428 --> 51:25.343
Wait! Wait!

51:26.561 --> 51:28.476
You turn the thing off and now
you're leaving with the music?

51:28.563 --> 51:32.132
We're going
upstairs for a bit.

51:32.567 --> 51:35.004
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Love y'all.

51:37.050 --> 51:38.530
Turn the election back on!

51:38.617 --> 51:40.749
Hey, I'm sorry Cass!

51:40.836 --> 51:43.665
...those 20
electoral votes

51:43.752 --> 51:46.407
get Trump to 264, six away--

51:46.538 --> 51:48.453
I like her haircut!

51:53.632 --> 51:54.937
Man...

51:58.332 --> 51:59.638
That was crazy.

51:59.725 --> 52:03.337
Yeah, it was crazy.
Watch your step.

52:05.948 --> 52:07.298
We need that, man.

52:07.385 --> 52:09.909
- Yeah.
- We need that.

52:09.996 --> 52:11.954
Hey.

52:12.041 --> 52:15.697
- I want to show you something.
- Wait. Huh?

52:15.828 --> 52:18.047
Ugh!

52:18.178 --> 52:20.876
- Let me show you something.
- Sorry, what were you saying?

52:20.963 --> 52:23.488
No, take that. Just take it.

52:23.575 --> 52:25.751
- No, take it, take it. It's OK.
- I'm sorry.

52:25.838 --> 52:28.145
It's all right.

52:29.450 --> 52:30.103
Hello?

52:32.192 --> 52:32.758
What?

52:36.153 --> 52:38.677
Yo, yo, yo, yo.
Look, it's--

52:41.114 --> 52:43.725
What are you talking about?

52:44.639 --> 52:46.641
Yeah, well, that was like...
That was your whole thing.

52:46.728 --> 52:49.514
Like, that's your own problem,
like...

52:49.601 --> 52:51.733
Yeah, but why are you
stressing me out like this?

52:51.820 --> 52:54.040
It's so annoying, like...

52:56.173 --> 52:59.088
Seriously? Seriously? Now? Now?

52:59.219 --> 53:02.179
Now you're feeling bad? Like...

53:02.918 --> 53:05.486
Dude, what are you
talking about? Like...

53:05.573 --> 53:09.273
Why are you stressing me out
for nothing?

53:14.930 --> 53:19.021
Ugh! Are you serious?
Like, really? Really?

53:24.549 --> 53:26.290
All right, well, I gotta go.

53:26.377 --> 53:27.334
I gotta go!

54:02.543 --> 54:05.111
Hey.

54:06.155 --> 54:06.460
So?

54:09.681 --> 54:10.421
Uh, man.

54:11.639 --> 54:13.119
I had a great time.

54:13.206 --> 54:15.513
I had a lot of fun tonight.

54:16.209 --> 54:17.558
Probably about that time, right?

54:17.645 --> 54:19.212
You gotta get going?

54:19.299 --> 54:21.214
- What?
- You gotta--

54:21.780 --> 54:24.086
Wait, wait, what were you
about to show me?

54:24.173 --> 54:26.480
- Nah, it's nothing.
- No, tell me.

54:26.567 --> 54:28.700
You got a flight
to catch, right?

54:28.787 --> 54:31.311
Come on, man.
What were you about to show me?

54:31.398 --> 54:32.791
It's nothing.

54:33.574 --> 54:34.662
Seriously?

54:35.968 --> 54:39.841
- Just show me, like...
- No, it's nothing.

54:45.543 --> 54:46.108
What?

54:47.327 --> 54:47.632
Yo!

54:50.025 --> 54:56.597
All right, then we'll just give up
'cause I can see that you already have.

54:58.469 --> 55:00.340
What'd you say to me?

55:01.907 --> 55:04.692
What about that script
that actress asked about?

55:04.779 --> 55:06.346
Your film that
everybody's waiting to see?

55:06.433 --> 55:08.696
It's all over you, like...

55:08.827 --> 55:11.699
You came out here
to do something.

55:11.830 --> 55:13.658
Are you just giving up?

55:20.360 --> 55:22.275
Says the lady who...

55:26.801 --> 55:29.891
You're not even trying to
follow your dream.

55:29.978 --> 55:31.415
Give me a break.

55:33.199 --> 55:35.506
What do you mean?

55:35.984 --> 55:37.899
What do I mean? You're not
trying to follow your dream.

55:37.986 --> 55:39.379
You're living all safe,

55:39.466 --> 55:41.642
you go back to your little
comfy, boredom,

55:41.729 --> 55:44.558
basic... what,
nine to five?

55:44.689 --> 55:47.779
You kidding me?
Telling me I'm giving up?

55:47.866 --> 55:49.433
Fuck outta here.

55:49.781 --> 55:50.999
- Come on.
- Oh. OK.

55:51.086 --> 55:52.784
So, now you know my life.

55:52.871 --> 55:54.655
- Yeah, I do.
- You do? You know my life?

55:54.742 --> 55:56.483
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, 'cause I live here.

55:56.570 --> 55:59.007
The city of dreams, right?

56:00.444 --> 56:03.403
People be like,
"Girl, let's go to LA!

56:03.490 --> 56:06.754
Let's go to New York!
Let's go to Miami, but, whoa,

56:06.841 --> 56:11.324
let's not go too crazy, like,
let's not get free."

56:11.455 --> 56:14.022
What you're trying to say?
You're free?

56:14.109 --> 56:15.110
- Yeah.
- Are you free?

56:15.197 --> 56:16.416
- Really?
- Yeah.

56:16.503 --> 56:18.810
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

56:20.159 --> 56:22.379
I'm getting mine, yeah.

56:24.032 --> 56:25.294
You think so?

56:32.476 --> 56:36.741
Mm-hmm, yeah,
I see you getting yours.

56:36.828 --> 56:40.353
You know what's crazy to me?
I think, um...

56:40.484 --> 56:43.051
I think you're safer than I am.

56:43.138 --> 56:44.923
I think the closest that
you've come to feeling alive

56:45.010 --> 56:47.360
is trying to fuck a girl named
Free in the club bathroom.

56:47.447 --> 56:51.408
So, yeah, I see you.
I see you getting yours.

57:00.982 --> 57:01.983
I'm sorry.

57:06.074 --> 57:08.555
I saw that kid, earlier.

57:08.686 --> 57:11.253
I saw how he looked at you.

57:12.429 --> 57:13.952
He admired you.

57:15.693 --> 57:16.128
Hey.

57:20.872 --> 57:23.091
What do you really want?

57:25.659 --> 57:29.054
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.

57:30.403 --> 57:31.926
Nothing happened, all right?

57:32.013 --> 57:33.319
Nothing. Nothing happened.

57:33.406 --> 57:37.149
Everything's always
fucking happening.

57:38.019 --> 57:41.109
I get tired of
fighting every day.

57:43.285 --> 57:45.113
I fight every day.
That's my occupation.

57:45.200 --> 57:46.941
I fight every day.

57:48.029 --> 57:49.988
That's what happened.

58:14.273 --> 58:17.363
He really did a number
on you, huh?

58:38.123 --> 58:38.558
Hey.

59:19.425 --> 59:22.863
Oh, my God!
He did not just win!

59:22.994 --> 59:24.735
He did not just win!

59:26.911 --> 59:30.131
Trump is fucking
president.

59:32.177 --> 59:33.439
Oh...

59:41.839 --> 59:42.274
Wow.

01:00:16.874 --> 01:00:17.439
Oh...

01:00:28.102 --> 01:00:29.538
Geez...

01:00:41.812 --> 01:00:43.378
I'll follow you.

01:00:45.032 --> 01:00:46.338
Shit.

01:01:34.516 --> 01:01:35.996
Hey, hey, y'all!
Hey, hey, hey.

01:01:36.083 --> 01:01:37.694
Everybody knows what
it's like to fight.

01:01:37.781 --> 01:01:40.522
We've all fuckin'
have fought before.

01:01:40.609 --> 01:01:43.525
Everybody knows what
it feels like to struggle.

01:01:43.612 --> 01:01:45.614
Uh, struggle to be loved,

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:48.226
to love, to work,
to be free.

01:01:52.012 --> 01:01:52.883
So, uh...

01:01:55.668 --> 01:01:56.930
we're still fighting, right?

01:01:57.017 --> 01:01:59.106
Tonight proves
that it's not different.

01:01:59.193 --> 01:02:01.587
So now we know we just got
more work to do.

01:02:01.674 --> 01:02:04.503
That means you too, huh?

01:02:04.633 --> 01:02:05.199
What?

01:02:06.113 --> 01:02:07.854
That means you too.

01:02:07.941 --> 01:02:11.945
What you're saying is you got
more work to do, too, right?

01:02:12.032 --> 01:02:13.338
Yeah, Ray.

01:02:13.425 --> 01:02:16.341
Real work that we all know
you can do.

01:02:18.038 --> 01:02:19.866
- I said, "Yeah."
- Yeah.

01:02:19.953 --> 01:02:22.913
- All right.
- That means me, too.

01:02:23.957 --> 01:02:26.568
Handle your business, Cass.

01:02:36.796 --> 01:02:37.710
Let's go.

01:03:00.298 --> 01:03:01.908
Oh, man...

01:03:40.207 --> 01:03:41.513
Ohh...

01:03:44.995 --> 01:03:48.607
Doesn't look as bright
as it was before.

01:03:49.434 --> 01:03:50.696
Yeah.

01:03:53.046 --> 01:03:54.134
Oh, well...

01:04:02.664 --> 01:04:06.320
Naqeeb...
you're still here.

01:04:07.539 --> 01:04:09.193
Yeah, I got, uh...

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.412
stuck listening to all of this.

01:04:11.499 --> 01:04:14.198
I would've been
a danger on the road, so...

01:04:14.285 --> 01:04:15.895
I didn't drive.

01:04:16.026 --> 01:04:17.810
Understood.

01:04:17.941 --> 01:04:19.681
What is it, man?

01:04:19.768 --> 01:04:22.728
How could you not be,
man?

01:04:24.686 --> 01:04:26.993
You guys leaving?

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:28.473
You want some company?

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:31.084
Yeah.
Could use some of that.

01:04:31.171 --> 01:04:32.912
So how about I order it
and then you--

01:04:32.999 --> 01:04:35.567
No, man. I got you.

01:04:36.176 --> 01:04:37.482
Nah, it's cool. I can--

01:04:37.569 --> 01:04:39.876
Nah.
Where you all goin'?

01:04:39.963 --> 01:04:40.615
Hop in.

01:04:41.355 --> 01:04:42.704
Goin' to Mel's.

01:04:42.791 --> 01:04:46.404
- I got you.
- All right.

01:05:10.776 --> 01:05:11.733
Thank you.

01:05:12.343 --> 01:05:14.214
Of course.

01:05:14.345 --> 01:05:17.217
- You said "Mel's", right?
- Yeah.

01:05:17.304 --> 01:05:18.827
Donald Trump,
after the election's,

01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:20.917
president-elect
of the United States.

01:05:21.004 --> 01:05:24.790
And then Clinton headquarters
in New York City

01:05:24.877 --> 01:05:28.141
stand on baited breath
waiting for the final word,

01:05:28.228 --> 01:05:30.709
that there may
still be a chance,

01:05:30.796 --> 01:05:33.538
but all they get instead
is a simple statement

01:05:33.625 --> 01:05:35.844
from Chairman John Podesta,

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:38.804
saying, "We're not going to have
anything to say tonight.

01:05:38.891 --> 01:05:41.459
Get some sleep.
We're so proud of you--"

01:05:41.546 --> 01:05:43.287
Naqeeb, you can turn the heat
down a little bit.

01:05:43.374 --> 01:05:44.853
Of course.

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:47.247
"She's not done yet."

01:05:47.334 --> 01:05:49.467
I'm at a loss for words.

01:05:49.902 --> 01:05:52.470
I digress,
I go to my listeners.

01:05:52.557 --> 01:05:53.775
Caller one?

01:05:57.344 --> 01:06:00.173
It's kinda funny saying "Turn
the heat down in Los Angeles."

01:06:02.175 --> 01:06:04.612
He's waving
to the public.

01:06:04.699 --> 01:06:06.527
There's no question--

01:06:06.614 --> 01:06:08.529
It's kind of a cold night,
though.

01:06:08.616 --> 01:06:10.705
Understand.

01:06:12.707 --> 01:06:14.927
...misogyny, homophobia,
the bigotry...

01:06:15.014 --> 01:06:18.104
This is what we've seen
in real time

01:06:18.235 --> 01:06:21.281
and through history
with this guy,

01:06:21.412 --> 01:06:25.198
when he was kicking black people
out of their homes in New York,

01:06:25.285 --> 01:06:27.287
when he was piling up

01:06:27.418 --> 01:06:30.334
the sexual assault cases
from these young women,

01:06:30.421 --> 01:06:33.554
a lot of them are probably still
scared to say anything.

01:06:33.641 --> 01:06:36.383
But what's deeper than that,
Tim, what's deeper than that,

01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:39.212
what I'm worried about is what's
happening to our country.

01:06:39.299 --> 01:06:41.562
What's happening to the people,

01:06:41.649 --> 01:06:43.129
to the children,

01:06:43.216 --> 01:06:45.001
because of a guy like that...

01:06:45.088 --> 01:06:48.047
Say what you will
about Obama,

01:06:48.178 --> 01:06:51.094
but he won by people
coming together

01:06:51.181 --> 01:06:53.792
and believing
in something bigger.

01:06:53.879 --> 01:06:57.622
I remember that day
and I know you do, too.

01:06:57.709 --> 01:07:00.407
Trump? Trump will not heal.

01:07:00.538 --> 01:07:03.149
It was his appeal.

01:07:03.236 --> 01:07:05.934
And now,
this country's more divided

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:08.024
than I've ever seen in my life.

01:07:08.111 --> 01:07:09.025
My job...

01:07:14.508 --> 01:07:16.728
we represent bad people.

01:07:19.426 --> 01:07:22.473
There's too many
bad people winning.

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:27.434
...just lying
and hateful and violent--

01:07:27.565 --> 01:07:29.610
Too many bad people winning.

01:07:29.697 --> 01:07:32.439
And I'm afraid.

01:07:33.527 --> 01:07:35.399
Can't say it better.

01:07:37.357 --> 01:07:38.358
Sums it up.

01:07:50.153 --> 01:07:51.502
God.

01:07:52.329 --> 01:07:54.722
Dig even deeper
than that and what do we have?

01:07:54.809 --> 01:07:57.812
We have, what, the-the massacre

01:07:57.943 --> 01:08:01.033
of our-our Native...
Native American Indians?

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:03.731
Dig deeper.
What about slavery?

01:08:03.818 --> 01:08:08.388
And the confiscation
of our native peoples' land?

01:08:08.519 --> 01:08:12.392
He made
America hate again.

01:08:14.046 --> 01:08:18.094
This country is called "the
United States," for a reason.

01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:19.877
Think about that.

01:08:20.313 --> 01:08:24.143
The first name in our country
is "United".

01:08:25.752 --> 01:08:27.145
And, I'm sorry,

01:08:28.669 --> 01:08:30.453
we're more divided than ever.

01:08:30.541 --> 01:08:34.153
And I don't know
what's gonna change it.

01:08:35.546 --> 01:08:37.765
That's all I gotta say.
Thank you.

01:08:37.852 --> 01:08:39.245
Oh, my goodness.

01:08:39.332 --> 01:08:41.160
Rob, I'm happy to know

01:08:41.247 --> 01:08:43.249
there are people like you
out there in the world.

01:08:43.336 --> 01:08:47.166
That this is what makes
America great.

01:08:48.385 --> 01:08:49.037
You OK?

01:08:56.044 --> 01:08:56.957
I will be.

01:09:22.636 --> 01:09:24.421
Trump promised
to build a separate wall

01:09:24.508 --> 01:09:26.423
between the southern border
and Mexico.

01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:28.729
Bringing back
manufacturing jobs--

01:09:33.081 --> 01:09:36.955
Feel bad for the children
that have to...

01:09:37.085 --> 01:09:40.479
Say the first president
was this guy.

01:10:06.027 --> 01:10:08.291
What are you thinking?

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:13.818
Was thinking how
I named my son after...

01:10:14.688 --> 01:10:16.299
my favorite poet.

01:10:20.128 --> 01:10:22.696
Or how excited I was to, um--

01:10:24.263 --> 01:10:27.919
when he was old enough
to understand it.

01:10:28.093 --> 01:10:31.531
Yeah, Rumi was one of our
great writers.

01:10:32.706 --> 01:10:34.317
I was thinking how

01:10:39.496 --> 01:10:41.976
there would be nothing better
right now than for my kid

01:10:42.063 --> 01:10:44.065
to write a poem, so...

01:10:57.340 --> 01:10:58.297
Oh, man...

01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:10.266
I always tell him
that he's smart,

01:11:10.396 --> 01:11:13.051
he's strong and he's loving.

01:11:18.970 --> 01:11:22.278
If he's anything like,
you, then he is.

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:29.459
It's nice to meet you.

01:11:31.112 --> 01:11:33.506
It's nice to meet you, too.

01:12:17.463 --> 01:12:19.335
You know what, Free?

01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:23.991
It's safe to say
I'm starting to remember

01:12:24.078 --> 01:12:25.863
why I moved out here.

01:12:28.996 --> 01:12:29.432
Why?

01:12:54.892 --> 01:12:57.982
So the good people
can win for once.

01:12:58.112 --> 01:13:00.985
The good people
can win for one.

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:04.205
Amen.

01:13:06.904 --> 01:13:08.862
Naqeeb, you want anything?

01:13:08.949 --> 01:13:12.475
Nah, I'm good, man.
Thank you.

01:13:12.562 --> 01:13:13.954
God bless you.

01:13:14.085 --> 01:13:16.304
As-Salaam-Alaikum.

01:13:16.392 --> 01:13:19.786
Wa-Alaikum-Salaam.

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:21.168
Is this...?

01:15:22.256 --> 01:15:24.476
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:18:12.339 --> 01:18:12.992
Wow...

01:18:16.126 --> 01:18:16.561
Wow.

01:18:19.346 --> 01:18:22.480
- What are you thinking?
- I mean...

01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:28.094
I need to see this.

01:18:28.486 --> 01:18:31.445
- Like, I need to see that.
- But it's not--

01:18:31.532 --> 01:18:33.360
The full-length version
of that!

01:18:33.447 --> 01:18:36.233
- It's a rough-- Gotta edit it--
- No. No! No, seriously.

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:38.104
Like, you need to send that.

01:18:38.191 --> 01:18:39.627
Send the script.

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:41.368
It's just--
It's not finished--

01:18:41.455 --> 01:18:44.415
Send the script to the actress
from the club.

01:18:44.502 --> 01:18:46.809
Just send it to her.
Send it as is.

01:18:46.896 --> 01:18:48.549
Go for it. Like...

01:18:52.597 --> 01:18:54.860
Like... do you understand

01:18:54.991 --> 01:18:56.906
how important this is now?

01:18:56.993 --> 01:18:59.343
And how important art is?

01:19:00.083 --> 01:19:01.911
This is everything,
this is our voice,

01:19:01.998 --> 01:19:03.521
this is who we are.

01:19:03.608 --> 01:19:05.871
This is all we have left.

01:19:06.002 --> 01:19:09.179
This is important, man, like...

01:19:10.267 --> 01:19:11.964
Just let me clean it up first.

01:19:12.051 --> 01:19:12.791
No, man.

01:19:15.576 --> 01:19:17.796
You need to send that.

01:19:17.927 --> 01:19:22.453
You need to send that.
Like, you need to send that!

01:19:22.583 --> 01:19:23.715
Seriously.

01:19:25.935 --> 01:19:27.153
This is everything.

01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:28.546
- Yeah?
- Whoa.

01:19:29.677 --> 01:19:32.376
Oh, with everything
that's going on,

01:19:32.463 --> 01:19:36.119
the fucking shit
we're dealing with, like...

01:19:36.206 --> 01:19:37.773
we got nothing else.

01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:39.426
We got our voice.

01:19:40.514 --> 01:19:42.516
We got what we put
into the world.

01:19:42.603 --> 01:19:44.910
We got purpose, we got...

01:19:46.433 --> 01:19:48.000
We can inspire.

01:19:51.351 --> 01:19:53.440
It can really change things.

01:19:53.527 --> 01:19:55.442
- You really think so?
- I really do.

01:19:55.529 --> 01:19:57.140
I really, really--

01:19:57.227 --> 01:19:58.315
I really do.

01:20:03.015 --> 01:20:06.236
- You're not bullshitting me?
- No.

01:20:08.542 --> 01:20:09.543
All right.

01:20:10.327 --> 01:20:11.632
You send that,

01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:14.505
get this thing going,

01:20:15.114 --> 01:20:16.550
and I'll, um...

01:20:17.464 --> 01:20:19.553
I'll cancel my flight.

01:20:23.209 --> 01:20:24.167
I'll stay.

01:20:26.517 --> 01:20:28.432
- No, for real, like, I'll--
- You wouldn't do that.

01:20:28.519 --> 01:20:33.480
--cancel my flight. I'll quit
my fucking job and stay.

01:20:34.568 --> 01:20:36.440
You crazy.

01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:44.404
You're for real.

01:20:46.232 --> 01:20:46.972
Send it.

01:20:50.802 --> 01:20:53.283
My flight is right here.

01:20:56.416 --> 01:20:57.200
Send it.

01:21:00.899 --> 01:21:01.682
Send it.

01:21:40.243 --> 01:21:41.635
One...

01:21:41.766 --> 01:21:42.419
two...

01:21:43.594 --> 01:21:44.247
three.
