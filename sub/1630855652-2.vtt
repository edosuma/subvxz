WEBVTT

00:04.583 --> 00:05.583
<i>I found it.</i>

00:05.583 --> 00:06.958
<i>The map?</i>

00:06.958 --> 00:09.458
<i>This one holds
the secret Morgan's after.</i>

00:09.458 --> 00:13.791
<i>The location of the last missing
Imperial Grand Admiral. Thrawn.</i>

00:17.500 --> 00:18.833
You know who could
help you with this?

00:18.833 --> 00:20.666
<i>I'm not sure she'll want to help.</i>

00:20.666 --> 00:22.666
<i>She'll do it. For Ezra.</i>

00:22.666 --> 00:24.458
<i>Sorry for disappearing on you.</i>

00:24.458 --> 00:26.375
<i>But I'm counting on you
to see this through.</i>

00:26.791 --> 00:28.125
I think I know how to find Ezra.

00:29.375 --> 00:30.583
Can I take this?

00:30.583 --> 00:32.500
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

00:32.500 --> 00:33.791
Why?

00:34.541 --> 00:37.083
This isn't just about finding Ezra.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.750
It's about preventing another war.

00:40.750 --> 00:42.500
You think I don't know that?

00:42.500 --> 00:44.375
The map stays here.

00:44.375 --> 00:45.875
Okay.

00:46.958 --> 00:51.458
She took the map off the ship
when I explicitly told her not to.

00:51.458 --> 00:53.791
<i>But you and I both know
Sabine gives you the best chance</i>

00:53.791 --> 00:55.416
<i>of reading that map.</i>

00:58.708 --> 01:00.500
Think I'm going on a trip.

01:05.958 --> 01:07.333
We've been looking for this.

01:49.291 --> 01:51.291
<i>You really think
Ezra's still out there?</i>

01:55.250 --> 01:57.291
<i>I'm counting on you
to see this through.</i>

02:00.583 --> 02:02.625
<i>This isn't just
about finding Ezra.</i>

02:03.708 --> 02:05.416
<i>It's about preventing another war.</i>

02:06.916 --> 02:08.333
<i>We've been looking for this.</i>

02:09.666 --> 02:10.833
<i>That's too bad.</i>

02:13.916 --> 02:14.916
Sabine.

02:31.208 --> 02:34.125
- The droids. They took the map.
- Relax.

02:35.875 --> 02:37.375
You don't understand. I...

02:38.583 --> 02:39.583
I unlocked it.

02:44.875 --> 02:45.916
There were two galaxies.

02:45.916 --> 02:49.416
And then a pathway appeared between them.

02:50.625 --> 02:52.666
Where did the path in our galaxy begin?

02:53.541 --> 02:54.541
What planet?

02:55.750 --> 02:57.750
They took the map
before I could decipher it.

03:01.875 --> 03:03.791
Did you keep a record of what you found?

03:06.500 --> 03:08.000
The droids destroyed it.

03:14.041 --> 03:15.041
How many droids were there?

03:15.666 --> 03:16.875
Two. I took one out.

03:20.375 --> 03:22.208
- Ahsoka.
- Get some rest.

03:22.208 --> 03:25.416
Wait. You need my help.

03:25.416 --> 03:28.208
No. You've done enough.

05:01.583 --> 05:02.666
Contact Morgan.

05:03.875 --> 05:07.541
Tell her I believe we have
located the reflex point on Seatos.

06:02.458 --> 06:04.166
<i>We've been looking for this.</i>

06:06.458 --> 06:07.625
<i>That's too bad.</i>

07:52.666 --> 07:54.458
I was hoping you were still here.

08:12.791 --> 08:15.833
As long as you didn't short out
its capacitors when you sliced it up,

08:15.833 --> 08:18.666
I should be able to work with it.

08:19.458 --> 08:20.708
Are you sure you're up to this?

08:20.708 --> 08:25.083
Like me, this kind of droid
is incredibly resilient.

08:27.791 --> 08:31.916
Take off an arm or leg
and it just keeps coming.

08:34.500 --> 08:38.666
That means they have several
built-in backup systems,

08:38.666 --> 08:40.625
and as a result...

08:40.625 --> 08:45.875
Its memory core stays partially active
even after termination.

08:45.875 --> 08:50.416
And if you get the power levels right,
you can recover the droid's memory.

08:50.416 --> 08:54.333
And find out where it came from.
Very clever.

08:54.333 --> 08:56.583
<i>So, what happens if you get
the power levels wrong?</i>

08:56.583 --> 08:59.375
- The head will explode.
-"Explode"?

08:59.375 --> 09:03.041
Calm your circuits. I can pull the plug
before it gets to that.

09:03.041 --> 09:05.500
Perhaps we should perform this
somewhere else.

09:05.500 --> 09:08.583
<i>- I say go for it.</i>
- Because you're a hologram.

09:09.583 --> 09:11.375
There's no time to relocate.

09:13.416 --> 09:15.083
We're falling behind as it is.

09:18.208 --> 09:19.208
It's now or never.

09:21.333 --> 09:22.333
Now.

09:24.083 --> 09:25.083
Here we go.

09:35.416 --> 09:37.541
The circuit temperature is rising.

09:37.541 --> 09:38.625
Anything?

09:43.416 --> 09:45.833
It's encrypted. I need a minute.

09:51.750 --> 09:53.666
I'm not sure we have a minute.

09:53.666 --> 09:55.833
It's overheating. Switch it off.

09:55.833 --> 09:57.166
Not yet.

10:03.875 --> 10:05.333
We are out of time!

10:07.666 --> 10:09.458
- I'm pulling the plug!
- No. Wait!

10:19.458 --> 10:20.583
What is it?

10:22.375 --> 10:24.125
This droid came here from Corellia.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.416
<i>The New Republic shipyard?</i>

10:32.333 --> 10:34.625
Morgan Elsbeth had factories on Corellia.

10:36.416 --> 10:39.583
<i>Her Imperial operations should have been
dismantled after the Rebellion.</i>

10:41.250 --> 10:42.375
Anyone check on that?

10:45.083 --> 10:46.083
<i>I'll meet you there.</i>

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Let's get going.

10:48.708 --> 10:50.083
No. You need to recover.

10:51.041 --> 10:52.041
I'm fine.

11:03.208 --> 11:04.208
<i>Hey.</i>

11:06.041 --> 11:07.083
<i>You did good.</i>

11:09.708 --> 11:10.708
Tell that to her.

11:12.958 --> 11:16.458
<i>I do. But she's not the one
who needs to hear it right now.</i>

11:22.916 --> 11:27.125
I haven't seen her in years
and the first thing I do goes sideways.

11:28.875 --> 11:30.166
<i>You're both difficult.</i>

11:31.291 --> 11:33.041
<i>I always thought that made it work.</i>

11:34.958 --> 11:35.958
Until it didn't.

11:38.583 --> 11:39.583
<i>Still...</i>

11:41.208 --> 11:42.916
<i>You need to help each other.</i>

11:43.458 --> 11:45.666
You heard her. She doesn't want my help.

11:47.583 --> 11:48.583
<i>Yes, she does.</i>

11:55.125 --> 11:56.125
<i>Now get some rest.</i>

11:57.541 --> 11:58.791
<i>You're gonna need it.</i>

12:04.833 --> 12:06.041
Thanks, Hera.

12:07.666 --> 12:08.666
<i>Anytime.</i>

12:26.250 --> 12:27.583
Show me what you've found.

12:42.708 --> 12:44.625
This place was not built by the Jedi.

12:45.875 --> 12:47.000
Whose work is it?

12:48.500 --> 12:51.041
An ancient people from a distant galaxy.

12:53.666 --> 12:54.958
Would you like to see it?

13:39.833 --> 13:42.375
This is our galaxy.

14:20.958 --> 14:24.041
That is our destination.

14:25.791 --> 14:28.583
Where Grand Admiral Thrawn
is banished.

14:30.500 --> 14:31.666
Pathway to Peridea?

14:33.125 --> 14:34.333
Some call it that.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.583
The children at the Jedi Temple
call it that.

14:37.583 --> 14:40.125
It comes from old stories, fairy tales.

14:41.208 --> 14:43.125
Tales which are based on truths.

14:46.166 --> 14:47.416
You're certain of this?

14:48.916 --> 14:50.750
I feel the path forward is clouded.

14:59.375 --> 15:00.666
Thrawn calls to me.

15:02.125 --> 15:04.833
Across time and space.

15:07.375 --> 15:08.708
You speak of dreams.

15:09.750 --> 15:11.541
Vague and fractured hopes.

15:14.916 --> 15:17.000
The threads of fate do not lie.

15:33.375 --> 15:35.583
The <i>Eye of Sion</i> is on its way here.

15:35.583 --> 15:38.458
Make sure that everything
is ready for its arrival.

15:39.125 --> 15:40.666
Marrok will complete his task.

15:42.208 --> 15:43.208
See that he does.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.125
Master...

16:08.666 --> 16:10.125
What happens when we find Thrawn?

16:13.541 --> 16:15.541
For some, war.

16:17.291 --> 16:18.291
For others...

16:20.541 --> 16:21.625
a new beginning.

16:23.708 --> 16:24.708
And for us?

16:27.208 --> 16:30.500
Power. Such as you've never dreamed.

16:36.125 --> 16:39.708
Go to Corellia.
Assist Marrok with the final transport.

16:42.833 --> 16:43.833
Yes, Master.

17:42.916 --> 17:46.208
Ahsoka Tano, this is Myn Weaver,
Regional Supervisor.

17:47.458 --> 17:50.375
I was just telling General Syndulla
that when the Empire fell,

17:50.375 --> 17:53.083
all Imperial assets
were dissolved and redistributed

17:53.083 --> 17:54.916
including those held by Morgan Elsbeth.

17:56.708 --> 18:00.041
All the same, we'd appreciate a look
at her former facilities and operations.

18:00.041 --> 18:02.625
Well, I am quite busy at the moment.

18:03.833 --> 18:06.708
I could make this
a more formal inspection, if you'd like.

18:10.416 --> 18:12.333
That won't be necessary, General.

18:13.125 --> 18:14.875
Please, this way.

18:25.333 --> 18:27.416
This was one of Morgan's facilities.

18:27.416 --> 18:29.750
She supplied raw materials
used in the construction

18:29.750 --> 18:33.125
of hyperdrive generators
for <i>Imperial</i>-class Star Destroyers.

18:33.125 --> 18:35.791
Now we're taking them apart
and using the cores

18:35.791 --> 18:37.625
to power the new ships
in the defense fleet.

18:38.666 --> 18:41.250
Do the facilities still employ
any of her former staff?

18:42.041 --> 18:44.791
Of course, there was no other way
to remain operational.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.833
An Empire doesn't just
become a Republic overnight.

18:47.833 --> 18:49.666
You will still find ex-Imperials

18:49.666 --> 18:52.083
at every level
of the New Republic government.

18:53.583 --> 18:56.333
- Don't you worry about their loyalty?
- Not at all.

18:56.333 --> 18:59.916
The average worker doesn't care
about the nuances of galactic politics.

19:00.416 --> 19:02.625
They have loyalty so long as they're paid.

19:03.958 --> 19:05.208
And you?

19:06.541 --> 19:10.416
I'm a businessman, General.
My loyalty is to my investors.

19:11.208 --> 19:12.916
I'll leave the politics up to you.

19:30.916 --> 19:33.041
Looks like connecting
with Sabine paid off.

19:36.375 --> 19:37.666
Until she lost the map.

19:38.250 --> 19:39.875
Well, at least she unlocked it.

19:39.875 --> 19:42.625
Which doesn't do us a lot of good
if we don't have it.

19:44.458 --> 19:45.458
She got us here.

19:48.375 --> 19:49.625
What are you getting at?

19:52.250 --> 19:55.708
I was wondering if you would consider
bringing her back on as your apprentice.

20:00.375 --> 20:01.750
Maybe we're both past that.

20:04.250 --> 20:06.125
I think she could use some structure.

20:07.916 --> 20:10.083
- And so could you.
- She's not ready.

20:14.375 --> 20:15.458
I'm curious.

20:17.666 --> 20:19.125
What makes someone ready?

20:21.458 --> 20:22.666
You just know.

20:25.166 --> 20:26.166
So do they.

20:52.333 --> 20:54.416
I heard your repairs were complete.

21:00.166 --> 21:03.708
Ah! I see you still have your lightsaber.

21:04.583 --> 21:05.916
Ezra's lightsaber.

21:05.916 --> 21:09.791
True, he constructed it,
and by all accounts it served him well.

21:09.791 --> 21:11.666
Then he passed it on to you.

21:11.666 --> 21:14.000
You have since made
your own modifications.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.250
So it is now your lightsaber.

21:17.250 --> 21:18.750
For all the good it did me.

21:18.750 --> 21:20.833
Have you kept up with your training?

21:20.833 --> 21:22.375
Obviously not.

21:22.375 --> 21:24.708
Well, perhaps it is time to begin again.

21:26.500 --> 21:28.000
I don't think that's up to me.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.083
Really? Explain.

21:31.833 --> 21:34.625
I can't train if Ahsoka
doesn't want to teach me.

21:34.625 --> 21:38.083
That is an excuse, and a poor one.

21:38.083 --> 21:41.458
Hey. She quit on me.

21:41.458 --> 21:44.708
The past is the past. Move forward.

21:49.916 --> 21:51.250
Okay, but answer this.

21:52.541 --> 21:56.208
If you could've unlocked the map yourself,
would Ahsoka have come here?

21:56.208 --> 21:57.291
Irrelevant.

21:58.625 --> 21:59.625
It's very relevant.

22:01.875 --> 22:03.375
Was I part of the plan?

22:04.458 --> 22:08.166
Was she going to tell me about Ezra
or was this little reunion Hera's idea?

22:08.166 --> 22:11.583
General Syndulla thought your insights
would be valuable.

22:12.250 --> 22:13.833
And Lady Tano agreed.

22:18.041 --> 22:19.041
See?

22:20.000 --> 22:21.500
She doesn't want me back.

22:22.333 --> 22:24.375
She wasn't even thinking about me.

22:24.375 --> 22:28.083
To be fair, you have never indicated
that you wanted to come back.

22:30.625 --> 22:32.041
Forgot how annoying you are.

22:32.541 --> 22:33.583
Logical.

22:37.083 --> 22:38.208
It doesn't matter.

22:39.583 --> 22:42.500
I never had the talent, the abilities.

22:44.083 --> 22:45.125
Not like Ezra.

22:45.125 --> 22:46.958
That much is true.

22:48.500 --> 22:49.541
Thanks.

22:49.541 --> 22:52.208
I have known many Padawans
over the centuries,

22:52.208 --> 22:55.166
and I can safely say
your aptitude for the Force

22:55.166 --> 22:57.541
would fall short of them all.

23:01.333 --> 23:02.333
Well then.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.208
I won't waste any more of her time.

23:09.083 --> 23:12.541
The only time you are wasting is your own.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.541
Welcome to the control center.

23:35.541 --> 23:37.625
From here, we keep track
of the entire inventory

23:37.625 --> 23:40.708
being created from the dismantled
Imperial Fleet.

23:40.708 --> 23:44.083
We're able to find a use for everything
in many different sectors.

23:44.083 --> 23:46.375
The profits generated
from a single Star Destroyer

23:46.375 --> 23:49.875
are enough to fund various
New Republic reconstruction programs,

23:49.875 --> 23:52.125
- among other things.
- Other things like?

23:52.625 --> 23:56.791
Well, our board and primary investors
have first look at all unique hardware,

23:56.791 --> 23:58.583
its price point, and distribution.

23:59.250 --> 24:00.666
Is that a hyperdrive core?

24:01.958 --> 24:02.958
Yes.

24:03.875 --> 24:07.750
Refurbished from an SSD, ready
for its new life serving the Republic.

24:07.750 --> 24:10.875
This facility has produced
nine of these new models.

24:10.875 --> 24:14.291
The New Republic defense fleet
isn't building anything that big.

24:14.291 --> 24:16.500
What class of starship are they for?

24:16.500 --> 24:19.083
Uh. Let's see.

24:26.583 --> 24:27.958
Oh, there it is.

24:29.041 --> 24:30.125
"Classified."

24:30.750 --> 24:31.750
"Classified"?

24:32.416 --> 24:34.541
I'm a General. Nothing's classified to me.

24:36.708 --> 24:40.750
I'm sorry. I cannot unseal a document
without authorization.

24:41.458 --> 24:43.041
Well, then I'm authorizing it.

24:43.041 --> 24:44.416
I'm not sure you can.

24:45.166 --> 24:46.166
Wanna bet?

24:51.083 --> 24:53.250
C-1, can you come over here, please?

24:54.500 --> 24:56.750
Perhaps you can help
with the protocol here.

24:56.750 --> 24:59.541
What other types of droids
do you have in operation?

24:59.541 --> 25:02.541
Standard protocol types as well as CCLs,

25:02.541 --> 25:05.458
IW-37s, HV-7s, and other load lifters.

25:06.250 --> 25:07.250
Why do you ask?

25:08.000 --> 25:09.125
No HK-class?

25:09.583 --> 25:10.958
Assassin droids?

25:12.833 --> 25:13.833
I should think not.

25:13.833 --> 25:17.291
Not even repurposed?
You know, to stay on schedule?

25:17.291 --> 25:18.791
No, I'm sorry.

25:18.791 --> 25:20.833
I have seen such a droid.

25:20.833 --> 25:24.083
I catalog inventory
on arriving transports.

25:24.083 --> 25:28.625
An HK-class droid recently prevented me
from completing this task.

25:29.833 --> 25:31.041
When was this?

25:31.041 --> 25:32.500
Five rotations ago.

25:34.458 --> 25:35.958
Why didn't you log a report?

25:35.958 --> 25:38.958
The droid carried
a high-level security clearance.

25:38.958 --> 25:40.333
I could not object.

25:40.333 --> 25:41.625
Where is this droid now?

25:41.625 --> 25:44.458
I believe it is departing
on that transport.

25:47.458 --> 25:48.500
Stop that ship.

25:48.500 --> 25:51.625
I can't do that, General.
They've been cleared for departure.

25:51.625 --> 25:54.208
I said, stop that ship! That's an order!

25:54.208 --> 25:55.375
For the Empire!

26:04.583 --> 26:05.791
- Get the <i>Phantom.</i>
- Right.

26:27.291 --> 26:29.791
Fire up the engines, Chop!

27:28.083 --> 27:30.458
Transport CT-05, this is General Syndulla.

27:30.458 --> 27:33.375
I order you to stand down
and return to port immediately.

27:36.375 --> 27:39.041
I repeat, CT-05, return to port.

27:54.625 --> 27:55.875
Keep your lid on, Chop.

28:40.125 --> 28:42.958
I can't just shoot it down,
it would crash into the port city.

28:44.500 --> 28:48.208
Just ready a tracking device.
And don't miss this time!

29:15.875 --> 29:17.916
No, I did not go through your stuff.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.041
Did you look under the backup battery?

29:25.666 --> 29:28.875
Great. Now hurry up, they're gonna
make the jump into hyperspace

29:28.875 --> 29:30.333
as soon as they clear the atmosphere.

30:17.875 --> 30:19.291
Get ready.

30:23.958 --> 30:25.041
Now, Chop!

30:32.916 --> 30:35.416
Good work, Chop. You got them.

30:41.375 --> 30:42.458
I'm here.

30:43.625 --> 30:45.083
Tell me you have good news.

30:46.250 --> 30:48.708
We got a tracking device
on that transport.

30:50.166 --> 30:51.166
All right, then.

33:11.333 --> 33:12.333
What a mess.

33:13.583 --> 33:15.291
How can they still be loyal to the Empire?

33:15.291 --> 33:17.166
Let's go, move. Move.

33:22.541 --> 33:23.541
It's not loyalty.

33:24.916 --> 33:25.916
It's greed.

33:28.083 --> 33:30.916
Hey, Chopper, what's the update
on that tracking beacon?

33:32.791 --> 33:34.458
Well, keep working on it.

33:35.041 --> 33:38.125
When Chopper has something
more definitive, I'll let you know.

34:04.583 --> 34:05.583
<i>I'm ready.</i>

35:28.375 --> 35:29.375
Nice haircut.

35:32.500 --> 35:33.500
It's more me.

35:37.833 --> 35:41.291
I have just received a transmission
from General Syndulla.

35:41.291 --> 35:45.041
It appears the transport was traced
to the Denab system.

35:45.041 --> 35:47.750
It has remained in orbit
around the planet Seatos.

35:50.750 --> 35:51.833
We better get moving.

36:17.916 --> 36:20.291
Calculations are complete.
You may proceed.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.083
Take us out.

36:26.625 --> 36:27.708
Padawan.

37:14.166 --> 37:16.916
Installation of the final hyperdrive
has begun.

37:17.958 --> 37:20.250
Soon the <i>Eye of Sion</i> will be complete

37:20.250 --> 37:25.041
and we shall deliver Grand Admiral Thrawn
from his exile in the far galaxy.

37:25.041 --> 37:26.458
<i>The sooner the better.</i>

37:27.291 --> 37:30.125
The appearance of Ahsoka Tano
on Corellia troubles you?

37:31.708 --> 37:32.708
<i>It does.</i>

37:34.750 --> 37:38.291
<i>We made a clean escape.
She couldn't have tracked us here.</i>

37:39.583 --> 37:42.500
Baylan, what do you see?

37:52.750 --> 37:54.666
<i>Her presence in the Force is elusive.</i>

37:56.750 --> 38:00.458
<i>Yet her determination is vivid.</i>

38:01.791 --> 38:02.791
<i>She is coming.</i>

38:04.458 --> 38:06.875
Nothing can prevent our journey.

38:09.083 --> 38:11.833
<i>To kill her will be a shame.</i>

38:13.125 --> 38:14.666
<i>There are so few Jedi left.</i>

38:16.125 --> 38:17.125
Sentimental?

38:18.666 --> 38:19.666
<i>Truth.</i>
