00:01.018 --> 00:02.742
You are being watched.

00:03.943 --> 00:05.896
The government has
a secret system.

00:06.204 --> 00:09.675
A machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:10.377 --> 00:12.623
I know because I built it.

00:13.157 --> 00:15.342
I designed the machine to
detect acts of terror

00:15.425 --> 00:17.000
but it sees everything.

00:17.319 --> 00:19.800
Violent crimes involving
ordinary people,

00:20.050 --> 00:21.211
people like you.

00:21.501 --> 00:23.750
Crimes the government
considered irrelevant.

00:25.022 --> 00:28.373
They wouldn't act,
so I decided I would.

00:28.375 --> 00:30.241
But I needed a partner--

00:30.243 --> 00:32.944
Someone with the skills
to intervene.

00:32.946 --> 00:37.449
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:37.451 --> 00:39.100
You will never find us.

00:39.102 --> 00:41.236
But victim or perpetrator,

00:41.238 --> 00:44.039
if you're number's up,
we'll find you.

00:50.246 --> 00:54.466
You know why I'm here.
You know how I feel.

00:54.468 --> 00:56.284
I can't hide it anymore.

00:56.286 --> 00:59.921
What we're doing is wrong.

01:05.728 --> 01:07.846
You're not my regular guy.

01:07.848 --> 01:09.014
He's sick.

01:09.016 --> 01:14.936
They called me to fill in
at the last moment.

01:14.938 --> 01:17.138
Callahan car service.

01:17.140 --> 01:20.141
Zoe Morgan.
You changed my driver.

01:20.143 --> 01:21.659
Sorry for the inconvenience
Ms. Morgan,

01:21.661 --> 01:23.862
but Bill's come down
with laryngitis.

01:23.864 --> 01:26.031
Caught it from his son.

01:26.033 --> 01:27.482
Which son?

01:27.484 --> 01:29.117
Andy.
The younger one.

01:29.119 --> 01:32.871
We sent our best driver
in his place.

01:32.873 --> 01:36.324
I'll be the judge of that.

01:36.326 --> 01:38.927
No small talk, no questions,

01:38.929 --> 01:40.128
just stay in the car,

01:40.130 --> 01:45.100
and you keep
your eyes on the road.

01:45.102 --> 01:47.335
We'll settle up
at the end of the night.

01:47.337 --> 01:49.504
I look forward to it.

02:18.467 --> 02:21.219
Little trouble picking
this lock, Mr. Reese.

02:21.221 --> 02:23.254
It's not as easy as it looks.

02:23.256 --> 02:27.342
Never mind, I'm in.

02:34.100 --> 02:37.102
No photos of family or friends.

02:39.822 --> 02:43.224
Some jazz records.

02:43.226 --> 02:47.061
She dropped out of law school,
no current employer.

02:47.063 --> 02:49.664
But she buys
a $2 million dollar apartment

02:49.666 --> 02:51.116
for cash three years ago.

02:51.118 --> 02:54.419
What's she gotten
herself mixed up in?

03:12.377 --> 03:14.587
Where does she keep
the things she cares about?

03:15.524 --> 03:16.757
Where do you?

03:16.759 --> 03:22.030
I don't have
any things I care about.

03:22.032 --> 03:22.981
Slip.

03:22.983 --> 03:25.483
Zoe.

03:25.485 --> 03:26.951
You got it?

03:26.953 --> 03:30.538
You know I always come
through for you, Zoe.

03:34.360 --> 03:37.462
Be good, Slip.

03:44.620 --> 03:46.787
She just paid for something.

03:46.789 --> 03:48.640
A lot of money.
Cash.

03:48.642 --> 03:49.641
Do you know what it is?

03:49.643 --> 03:50.925
No.

03:50.927 --> 03:53.645
Do you want to know where
people hide things, Finch?

03:53.647 --> 03:54.462
Underneath.

04:06.525 --> 04:08.526
Keep your eyes on the road.

04:28.264 --> 04:29.814
Uh-oh.

04:35.971 --> 04:39.190
Leave it running,
I won't be long.

04:41.310 --> 04:43.645
Finch, the item
she bought was a gun.

04:43.647 --> 04:48.032
But she's already got a gun
in her living room.

04:48.034 --> 04:49.317
Why does she need another one?

04:49.319 --> 04:51.319
Well, the reason
you buy a gun off the street

04:51.321 --> 04:52.537
is so that it's untraceable.

04:52.539 --> 04:54.522
Possible her number came up

04:54.524 --> 04:57.242
because she plans
to kill someone.

05:03.250 --> 05:11.539
♪ ♪

05:36.415 --> 05:37.949
Finch, she's a shooter.

05:37.951 --> 05:39.117
Target's a cop.

05:39.119 --> 05:42.570
Lieutenant Gilmore.

05:51.580 --> 05:53.431
You owe me one.

05:53.433 --> 05:57.585
And so does the cop who left his
side arm in a subway bathroom.

05:57.587 --> 05:58.853
Believe me.
He knows.

05:58.855 --> 06:00.921
You saved a good cop's career.

06:00.923 --> 06:03.191
We need all the men
we can get right now.

06:03.193 --> 06:04.425
Mm-hmm.

06:04.427 --> 06:05.860
You sure this doesn't have
to do with the fact

06:05.862 --> 06:06.927
that he's your nephew?

06:06.929 --> 06:09.397
Either way, I'm grateful.

06:09.399 --> 06:12.867
In a perfect world,
gratitude would be enough.

06:12.869 --> 06:16.037
That politically motivated investigation

06:16.039 --> 06:18.656
that you're running
into councilman rush?

06:18.658 --> 06:20.541
About time you wrap it up.

06:20.543 --> 06:21.942
Don't you think?

06:21.944 --> 06:27.448
Now I know where the term,
"necessary evil" comes from.

06:27.450 --> 06:28.649
That makes us square?

06:28.651 --> 06:30.117
No,

06:30.119 --> 06:31.886
but it's a good start.

06:46.819 --> 06:48.469
See anything interesting
tonight?

06:48.471 --> 06:54.308
Nothing worth mentioning.

06:54.310 --> 06:57.779
Be here tomorrow.
10:00 sharp.

07:04.787 --> 07:07.622
I hope you're out
of there, Finch.

07:07.624 --> 07:12.493
Do you know what she does, yet?

07:12.495 --> 07:15.797
She does favors for a price.

07:15.799 --> 07:18.182
She's a fixer.

07:18.184 --> 07:20.635
Assuming then that
she's the victim,

07:20.637 --> 07:23.137
any ideas who'd want
to take her out?

07:23.139 --> 07:25.606
Who wouldn't?

07:31.157 --> 07:33.442
What do you got, Terney?

07:33.444 --> 07:36.111
Vincent Deluca.

07:36.113 --> 07:38.914
71 years old,

07:38.916 --> 07:40.866
public service homicide
if you ask me.

07:40.868 --> 07:42.034
The guy was an enforcer

07:42.036 --> 07:43.419
for La Cosa Nostra
in Brighton beach.

07:43.421 --> 07:46.038
Stabbing's personal.

07:46.040 --> 07:47.572
Is this knife from the kitchen?

07:47.574 --> 07:49.758
Nothing in there,
but a set of steak knives.

07:49.760 --> 07:53.578
This is not serrated.
Looks old, dull.

07:53.580 --> 07:57.850
Painful.

07:57.852 --> 08:00.019
We got a rap sheet
on this old gangster?

08:00.021 --> 08:01.887
Reads like a phone book.

08:01.889 --> 08:04.606
Armed robbery, racketeering--

08:04.608 --> 08:09.945
He was charged with homicide
in the mid '70s.

08:09.947 --> 08:12.364
Marlene Elias?

08:12.366 --> 08:13.615
What was that?

08:13.617 --> 08:15.901
Uh, 1973.

08:15.903 --> 08:18.287
The murder charge he skated on.

08:18.289 --> 08:20.605
Victim was Marlene Elias.

08:20.607 --> 08:22.324
The evidence
was stolen from lockup

08:22.326 --> 08:23.575
a couple weeks back.

08:23.577 --> 08:26.245
Evidence was stolen
from a 40-year-old cold case?

08:26.247 --> 08:27.796
And the murder weapon.

08:27.798 --> 08:31.717
Marlene Elias was stabbed
multiple times in her chest

08:31.719 --> 08:33.919
with a kitchen knife.

08:42.178 --> 08:43.729
Okay, Finch,
looks like Zoe's meeting

08:43.731 --> 08:45.130
with some businessman.

08:45.132 --> 08:46.732
Sending you photos.

08:46.734 --> 08:50.152
Got another guy watching
from a green SUV.

08:50.154 --> 08:52.021
Run a license plate for me.

08:52.023 --> 08:56.975
Gray, Henry, Oscar,
Seven, Five, Six, One.

08:56.977 --> 08:58.444
Ms. Morgan.

08:58.446 --> 09:01.413
Okay, I got a hit
on that license plate.

09:01.415 --> 09:03.315
Registered to Samuel Douglas.

09:03.317 --> 09:06.585
Head of crisis management
with Virtanen Pharmaceuticals.

09:06.587 --> 09:08.153
You familiar
with Anthony Talbott?

09:08.155 --> 09:09.588
Should I be?

09:09.590 --> 09:10.956
He's an investment blogger.

09:10.958 --> 09:12.708
No ethics or boundaries.

09:12.710 --> 09:14.676
He'd do anything
to get an inside scoop,

09:14.678 --> 09:17.463
including violate
our employees' right to privacy.

09:17.465 --> 09:19.848
We wouldn't be talking
if this had anything to do

09:19.850 --> 09:21.833
with just an employee.

09:21.835 --> 09:23.635
So what does
he have on your boss?

09:23.637 --> 09:26.055
Douglas' boss is
the gentleman in the car,

09:26.057 --> 09:28.557
- Mark Lawson.
- A recording he claims--

09:28.559 --> 09:29.674
A conversation
with a certain young lady

09:29.676 --> 09:31.843
that could be misconstrued.

09:31.845 --> 09:33.678
An affair?

09:33.680 --> 09:35.197
Who cares?

09:35.199 --> 09:36.482
His wife.

09:36.484 --> 09:38.500
Mr. Lawson is in line
to run Virtanen.

09:38.502 --> 09:40.519
He already handles
the day-to-day,

09:40.521 --> 09:43.072
but his father-in-law's
still the CEO.

09:43.074 --> 09:44.957
What the old man
doesn't know...

09:44.959 --> 09:46.792
What's Talbott asking?

09:46.794 --> 09:49.711
$40,000.

09:49.713 --> 09:51.413
His cell phone number's
in there.

09:51.415 --> 09:53.582
Oh, and, uh, one more thing.

09:53.584 --> 09:54.866
I'll get the recording.

09:54.868 --> 09:56.552
I don't need to
know what's on it.

09:56.554 --> 09:59.555
We appreciate your discretion,
as always.

10:11.901 --> 10:14.386
Good afternoon,
Mr. Talbott.

10:14.388 --> 10:17.940
Nice of Virtanen
to send a skirt.

10:17.942 --> 10:19.724
I understand that you have
something of interest

10:19.726 --> 10:20.892
to my client.

10:20.894 --> 10:24.896
You know, it is
amazing what you can find

10:24.898 --> 10:28.867
just drifting out there
in the ether.

10:28.869 --> 10:31.253
One thing I have learned

10:31.255 --> 10:33.839
about the, uh, smartest guys
in the room--

10:33.841 --> 10:36.675
They just can't keep it
in their pants.

10:36.677 --> 10:38.710
You know why I'm here.

10:38.712 --> 10:40.245
You know how I feel.

10:40.247 --> 10:43.915
I can't hide it anymore.

10:47.137 --> 10:48.270
This is all $40,000?

10:48.272 --> 10:51.089
Count it.

10:51.091 --> 10:53.809
At home.

10:53.811 --> 10:57.095
By the way, I would have
asked for $80,000.

10:57.097 --> 10:59.565
Maybe it's a skirt thing.

11:04.070 --> 11:05.821
Talbott's
a blackmailing scumbag,

11:05.823 --> 11:07.039
but hardly a threat.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.173
What about her previous jobs?

11:08.175 --> 11:09.941
No client list
in her apartment.

11:09.943 --> 11:11.910
You need to get her talking.

11:11.912 --> 11:14.079
Easier said than done.

11:17.783 --> 11:19.784
Ah.

11:19.786 --> 11:21.086
Detective Sullivan.

11:21.088 --> 11:22.787
Not for years now.

11:22.789 --> 11:25.624
Bernie or Sully.
Dealer's choice.

11:25.626 --> 11:28.644
I, um, wanted to talk about
that case you worked

11:28.646 --> 11:30.012
back in '73.

11:30.014 --> 11:32.130
Marlene Elias.

11:32.132 --> 11:35.067
How did that mess
come up again?

11:35.069 --> 11:37.653
A man I'm investigating broke
into the evidence lockup

11:37.655 --> 11:39.137
a few weeks ago.

11:39.139 --> 11:41.156
He and his crew
sold the contents

11:41.158 --> 11:42.641
of the evidence box.

11:42.643 --> 11:45.160
Your notes, murder weapon,

11:45.162 --> 11:47.029
8 inch kitchen knife.

11:47.031 --> 11:49.147
Which turned out plunged
into the chest

11:49.149 --> 11:50.666
of your lead suspect.

11:50.668 --> 11:51.816
Hmm.

11:51.818 --> 11:54.853
That would be
divine retribution.

11:54.855 --> 11:57.673
What can you tell me
about Deluca?

11:57.675 --> 11:59.424
Piece of work.

11:59.426 --> 12:02.294
I had him dead to rights
on murdering that woman.

12:02.296 --> 12:05.013
The dimwit left a partial
on the knife.

12:05.015 --> 12:06.848
The DA dropped the case?

12:06.850 --> 12:08.467
Bought and sold.

12:08.469 --> 12:11.136
Back then,
the city was different.

12:11.138 --> 12:13.505
Marlene was
a cocktail waitress.

12:13.507 --> 12:16.642
She worked in a club owned
by Gianni Moretti.

12:16.644 --> 12:18.843
She has an affair with the don.

12:18.845 --> 12:20.646
She wants him to dump his wife.

12:20.648 --> 12:23.732
He gets tired of her complaints,
and sends our friend here,

12:23.734 --> 12:26.368
the cutlery rack,
to shut her up.

12:26.370 --> 12:27.852
He did.

12:27.854 --> 12:30.289
Permanently.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.357
The thing that stuck
with me was the kid.

12:32.359 --> 12:33.875
Kid?
What kid?

12:33.877 --> 12:35.026
I dug these up.

12:35.028 --> 12:37.913
Marlene and the don had a kid.

12:37.915 --> 12:39.364
A son.

12:39.366 --> 12:41.800
He was out back playing
when it happened.

12:41.802 --> 12:44.303
Came inside and he found her.

12:44.305 --> 12:47.005
Kid walked all the way
to the station.

12:47.007 --> 12:51.009
I still got that image of him
standing there with no shoes on.

12:51.011 --> 12:52.177
What happened to him?

12:52.179 --> 12:54.680
Well, he didn't want
to cop to the affair,

12:54.682 --> 12:56.265
so the kid went
into the system.

12:56.267 --> 13:00.552
I don't have to tell you
what happens to those kids.

13:00.554 --> 13:02.721
You think he's the killer?

13:02.723 --> 13:05.774
Don't know who else would
go to so much trouble.

13:12.832 --> 13:13.782
What is that?

13:13.784 --> 13:15.667
Ah, just some old bootlegs.

13:15.669 --> 13:17.068
You like jazz?

13:17.070 --> 13:18.403
You do?

13:18.405 --> 13:20.205
Sure.

13:20.207 --> 13:23.375
Always loved what Miles Davis
said about jazz.

13:23.377 --> 13:27.095
"Don't play what's there.
Play what's not there."

13:27.097 --> 13:29.514
Really?

13:29.516 --> 13:32.384
You seem to know
how to play people.

13:32.386 --> 13:35.587
I don't play people.
I fix their problems.

13:35.589 --> 13:39.641
And to answer your question,
no, I hate jazz.

13:52.405 --> 13:55.774
We're you supposed to be
meeting with two people or one?

13:55.776 --> 13:57.125
What does it matter?

13:57.127 --> 13:58.710
Let me take care of this, Zoe.

13:58.712 --> 14:00.078
It's Ms. Morgan.

14:00.080 --> 14:04.383
Get back in the car.

14:07.321 --> 14:10.305
♪ ♪

14:10.307 --> 14:12.841
You didn't tell me
it was a party.

14:12.843 --> 14:17.012
Talbott handed it over.
No problems.

14:30.827 --> 14:32.160
Did you listen to this?

14:32.162 --> 14:36.832
You didn't hire me to listen.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.817
Mr. Lawson would like
to personally thank you.

14:38.819 --> 14:40.502
His fee is
all that's necessary.

14:40.504 --> 14:42.320
No, we insist.

14:42.322 --> 14:44.172
Walter, get the driver.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.192
- Get down.
- Ah!

15:08.297 --> 15:10.532
Guess I'm paying you
to do more than drive.

15:10.534 --> 15:11.733
Mr. Reese, are you okay?

15:11.735 --> 15:13.151
Yeah, the hand-off
was an ambush.

15:13.153 --> 15:14.619
Douglas tried
to kill both of us.

15:14.621 --> 15:16.738
Oh, thanks.
I was there, remember?

15:16.740 --> 15:17.956
Is she safe, Mr. Reese?

15:17.958 --> 15:19.207
For now.
A little shaken up.

15:19.209 --> 15:20.859
Who are you talking to?

15:20.861 --> 15:22.077
They're willing to kill
for that recording.

15:22.079 --> 15:23.912
We need to find out
what's on it.

15:23.914 --> 15:26.197
Send me Talbott's address.

15:26.199 --> 15:27.549
Who the hell are you?

15:27.551 --> 15:28.667
You can say we're
in the same business.

15:28.669 --> 15:29.868
Fixing problems.

15:29.870 --> 15:32.036
I had information that
you might be in danger.

15:32.038 --> 15:33.705
Information?

15:33.707 --> 15:34.923
Who gave it to you?

15:34.925 --> 15:39.227
You have your people.
I have mine.

15:39.229 --> 15:41.263
You need to find the journalist
who sold you that recording.

15:41.265 --> 15:47.235
Find out what's on it.

15:47.237 --> 15:49.321
I made a copy.

15:49.323 --> 15:52.774
I'm discreet, not stupid.

15:52.776 --> 15:54.993
I can't hide it anymore.

15:54.995 --> 15:57.061
- What we're doing is wrong.
- Who's the girl on the tape?

15:57.063 --> 15:59.414
No idea.
Can barely make it out.

16:13.379 --> 16:14.379
Stay here.

16:14.381 --> 16:15.464
Mr. Reese,

16:15.466 --> 16:18.133
report on the police band.
Talbott is dead.

16:18.135 --> 16:20.302
Apparent cardiac arrest.

16:20.304 --> 16:22.086
Oh, Douglas moves fast.

16:22.088 --> 16:24.523
They're killing everyone who had
contact with that recording.

16:24.525 --> 16:25.857
If they're going
to this much trouble,

16:25.859 --> 16:27.726
they'll be coming
after Ms. Morgan again.

16:27.728 --> 16:33.448
You need to stay with her.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.033
That's going to be a problem.

16:41.891 --> 16:44.559
I want to tell someone.

16:44.561 --> 16:46.645
Keeps me up at night.

16:46.647 --> 16:48.947
I'm working on the audio.

16:48.949 --> 16:50.065
Interference suggests

16:50.067 --> 16:52.534
it was made on
an old PCS cell network,

16:52.536 --> 16:55.270
making the recording
at least two years old.

16:55.272 --> 16:57.539
I didn't know static
had a vintage.

16:57.541 --> 17:01.893
I did manage to find a match
on the woman's voice.

17:01.895 --> 17:03.945
Compared it against video

17:03.947 --> 17:07.048
from social networking sites,
corporate press.

17:07.050 --> 17:10.417
268 possible matches,
6 who lived in New York

17:10.420 --> 17:13.722
but only one who worked
at Virtanen Pharmaceuticals.

17:13.723 --> 17:15.423
Virtanen is more than

17:15.425 --> 17:16.473
just a pharmaceutical company.

17:16.476 --> 17:19.010
We create products
that help and heal.

17:19.012 --> 17:21.980
Virtanen is a family.

17:21.982 --> 17:25.233
One I hope to be a part of
for many years to come.

17:25.234 --> 17:27.269
Dana Miller, Lawson's mistress,

17:27.271 --> 17:29.487
was an office romance.

17:29.489 --> 17:30.772
Nice work, Finch.

17:30.774 --> 17:36.161
I wouldn't be so quick
to congratulate me.

17:36.163 --> 17:37.445
It's not the first time

17:37.447 --> 17:41.750
I've heard Dana Miller's name.

17:41.752 --> 17:47.005
Six months ago,
the machine gave me her number.

17:48.824 --> 17:49.874
I had yet to track you down,

17:49.876 --> 17:53.011
so I wasn't in
a position to help her.

17:53.013 --> 17:57.498
Newspaper said she died
of a brain aneurysm.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.500
She was 27, and as you know,

17:59.502 --> 18:02.887
the machine
doesn't see accidents.

18:02.889 --> 18:04.689
So she wanted to go public
with the affair,

18:04.691 --> 18:06.942
and Lawson had her
killed for it.

18:06.944 --> 18:08.693
Why not pay her off, Finch?

18:08.695 --> 18:11.863
Lawson is heir
to the entire Virtanen empire.

18:11.865 --> 18:15.183
If Robert Keller ever found out,
Lawson would lose everything.

18:15.185 --> 18:16.234
It wouldn't be hard for someone

18:16.236 --> 18:17.902
working at
a pharmaceutical company

18:17.904 --> 18:21.189
to make murder
look like natural causes.

18:21.191 --> 18:23.658
I never thought
I'd know the truth

18:23.660 --> 18:26.461
about what happened to her.

18:26.463 --> 18:29.831
Now I also know
the men responsible.

18:29.833 --> 18:34.169
We can stop them from ever
giving us another number.

18:34.171 --> 18:36.338
Get out there,
and find Ms. Morgan.

18:36.340 --> 18:38.473
Every moment we don't have her

18:38.475 --> 18:40.208
is a moment that
Douglas can get to her.

18:40.210 --> 18:41.509
Well, what are you going to do?

18:41.511 --> 18:45.713
I have an important
business meeting.

18:45.715 --> 18:47.899
Recent investment of mine.

18:53.022 --> 18:54.239
We cleared my schedule

18:54.241 --> 18:56.274
for a meeting
with a shareholder.

18:56.276 --> 18:58.026
Guy isn't just a shareholder.

18:58.028 --> 19:02.247
Bought 87 million shares
in the last 48 hours.

19:02.249 --> 19:05.083
He now owns 8%
of Virtanen stock.

19:05.085 --> 19:06.368
Never heard of this guy.

19:06.370 --> 19:07.419
No one has.

19:07.421 --> 19:09.237
May be a straw buyer
for a takeover.

19:09.239 --> 19:10.672
Hostile bid.

19:10.674 --> 19:12.374
But, uh--
Kid gloves.

19:12.376 --> 19:13.958
And we may want to wheel
the old man in here

19:13.960 --> 19:15.410
for a minute
to press the flesh.

19:15.412 --> 19:17.212
Right this way, sir.

19:21.884 --> 19:24.102
Mr. Partridge.

19:24.104 --> 19:25.854
Mark Lawson.
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

19:25.856 --> 19:27.772
Thank you for meeting me
on such short notice.

19:27.774 --> 19:30.308
I thought I knew everyone
with an investment portfolio

19:30.310 --> 19:31.776
as broad as yours.

19:31.778 --> 19:33.945
When you're in a position
where people want your money,

19:33.947 --> 19:36.948
a little anonymity
is rather rewarding.

19:36.950 --> 19:38.149
From my time in Japan.

19:38.151 --> 19:39.317
I've learned never to go

19:39.319 --> 19:40.618
to a business meeting
empty-handed.

19:40.620 --> 19:43.438
That is--
You're generous.

19:43.440 --> 19:46.107
Thank you.

19:46.109 --> 19:48.293
You care for
a tour of our facilities?

19:48.295 --> 19:50.578
This way.

19:52.665 --> 19:54.632
What we like to focus on

19:54.634 --> 19:56.134
is what people really need--

19:56.136 --> 19:57.669
Pain relief.

19:57.671 --> 19:59.721
I can certainly relate to that.

19:59.723 --> 20:02.390
We reached a 20% market share
last year.

20:02.392 --> 20:04.625
And that's only going to rise
with the launch

20:04.627 --> 20:07.812
of our new product line,
anchored by Sylocet.

20:07.814 --> 20:08.897
Sylocet?

20:08.899 --> 20:10.315
New migraine drug.

20:10.317 --> 20:11.766
Revolutionary.

20:11.768 --> 20:14.354
Just approved by the FDA.

20:17.357 --> 20:20.525
Mr. Partridge.

20:20.527 --> 20:22.310
Robert Keller.

20:22.312 --> 20:24.362
This is an impressive empire
you've built here, sir.

20:24.364 --> 20:26.448
Oh, it's Mark's empire now.

20:26.450 --> 20:28.917
Retirement isn't officially
till next spring,

20:28.919 --> 20:32.537
but he makes
all the big decisions.

20:32.539 --> 20:34.005
Don't tell anyone.

20:34.007 --> 20:36.040
I'd hate to lose my table
at the country club.

20:38.328 --> 20:40.345
If you'll excuse me,
Mr. Partridge.

20:40.347 --> 20:41.996
Mark has done
an incredible job.

20:41.998 --> 20:44.516
Not only in keeping
our finances in order,

20:44.518 --> 20:46.434
but overseeing a good amount

20:46.436 --> 20:48.353
of product research.

20:48.355 --> 20:50.305
Mr. Keller,
I like what I see here.

20:50.307 --> 20:53.641
I'm confident
my money is in good hands.

20:53.643 --> 20:58.313
Lovely meeting you.

21:00.032 --> 21:02.734
Excuse me.

21:02.736 --> 21:06.237
I have to take this.

21:06.239 --> 21:07.822
Flash drive's recovered.

21:07.824 --> 21:11.326
Talbott won't be
a problem again.

21:11.328 --> 21:13.194
Great work.

21:13.196 --> 21:14.629
But just one loose end.

21:14.631 --> 21:16.214
Zoe Morgan.

21:16.216 --> 21:18.383
She had a bodyguard
posing as a driver.

21:18.385 --> 21:23.421
It was an unforeseen
circumstance.

21:23.423 --> 21:24.872
It's not a loose end.

21:24.874 --> 21:26.808
It's the whole damn thing
falling apart.

21:26.810 --> 21:27.926
I'll handle her.

21:27.928 --> 21:30.128
And the driver, too.

21:30.130 --> 21:32.514
Nothing can connect us
to this thing.

21:38.355 --> 21:39.654
Carter.

21:39.656 --> 21:40.721
It's Sully.

21:40.723 --> 21:42.490
I managed to fill in
some of the blanks

21:42.492 --> 21:44.075
on young Carl Elias.

21:44.077 --> 21:45.360
Good work.

21:45.362 --> 21:47.162
No, not so good.

21:47.164 --> 21:49.831
The kid was like
a professional runaway.

21:49.833 --> 21:51.449
From the age of eight,
he couldn't stay anywhere

21:51.451 --> 21:52.500
more than a couple of months.

21:52.502 --> 21:54.335
So no one really knew him.

21:54.337 --> 21:59.340
Nobody except some tough old
bird named Gloria Recinto.

21:59.342 --> 22:01.409
Apparently, she, uh,
she looked after him.

22:01.411 --> 22:04.179
He would send
her a Christmas card

22:04.181 --> 22:05.746
and some money every year.

22:05.748 --> 22:08.266
You gotta read
these things, Carla.

22:08.268 --> 22:09.517
I mean it's as if the guy

22:09.519 --> 22:11.970
was going to either be president
or Attila the Hun.

22:11.972 --> 22:13.771
You want me to bring him in?

22:13.773 --> 22:14.939
I'll swing by,
and pick them up.

22:14.941 --> 22:16.224
Oh.

22:16.226 --> 22:17.942
Well, I'm going to make myself
beautiful for you.

22:17.944 --> 22:20.478
Good luck with that, Sully.

22:22.731 --> 22:26.401
Know why I'm here.
You know how I feel.

22:26.403 --> 22:27.768
I still can't find Zoe.

22:27.770 --> 22:29.437
I can't hide it anymore.

22:29.439 --> 22:33.107
If I can't track her down,
Douglas probably can't either.

22:37.446 --> 22:38.713
Trying to clean up
this recording.

22:38.715 --> 22:41.282
Fill in the blanks.

22:41.284 --> 22:45.253
I think Dana recorded this
in Lawson's office, listen.

22:45.255 --> 22:46.688
What we're doing is wrong.

22:46.690 --> 22:47.889
So?

22:47.891 --> 22:50.592
She recorded the conversation
on her cell phone.

22:50.594 --> 22:51.643
To blackmail him?

22:51.645 --> 22:54.062
No, I don't think so.

22:54.064 --> 22:55.730
Here's the fountain
in his office.

22:55.732 --> 22:57.065
Using the bug I planted,

22:57.067 --> 23:01.019
I was able to get room tone,

23:01.021 --> 23:04.806
then I can strip it back out
of the original recording.

23:04.808 --> 23:06.140
Listen.
This is much clearer.

23:06.142 --> 23:07.909
I can't hide it anymore.

23:07.911 --> 23:09.844
What we're doing is wrong.

23:09.846 --> 23:11.412
I want to tell someone.

23:11.414 --> 23:13.414
Keeps me up at night,
knowing what our drug has done.

23:13.416 --> 23:16.200
You need to think
very carefully...

23:16.202 --> 23:19.654
"Keeps me up at night,
knowing what our drug has done""

23:19.656 --> 23:21.623
I still have to clean up
the last part of the recording,

23:21.625 --> 23:23.708
but there's enough here
that you can tell

23:23.710 --> 23:26.994
that Dana was not having
an affair with Lawson.

23:26.996 --> 23:30.265
She was threatening
to blow the whistle on him.

23:36.889 --> 23:38.473
You know, before we--

23:38.475 --> 23:42.176
before I found you,

23:42.178 --> 23:47.031
the numbers haunted me.

23:47.033 --> 23:51.035
I never felt so helpless
in my entire life.

23:51.037 --> 23:53.955
And I know I can't get justice
for all of them,

23:53.957 --> 23:59.711
but the possibility
of having just one...

24:03.583 --> 24:04.832
Looks like our Ms. Morgan

24:04.834 --> 24:07.535
has decided
to be found after all.

24:07.537 --> 24:08.803
This time, when you find her,

24:08.805 --> 24:12.473
try not to lose her.

24:29.558 --> 24:32.860
So you are tracking
my cell phone.

24:32.862 --> 24:36.731
I know how all the pieces
of the city fit together.

24:36.733 --> 24:38.833
I know all the players.

24:38.835 --> 24:42.120
I know all the angles.

24:42.122 --> 24:45.506
And then there's you.

24:45.508 --> 24:49.577
You know, I don't understand you.

24:49.579 --> 24:52.013
And I don't like things
that I don't understand.

24:52.015 --> 24:53.798
Then why did
you want me to come here?

24:53.800 --> 24:55.717
Because I don't have
to like you

24:55.719 --> 24:57.802
to get some news out of you.

24:57.804 --> 25:00.605
The girl on the recording.

25:00.607 --> 25:02.607
Her name was Dana Miller.

25:02.609 --> 25:05.026
Lawson had her killed.

25:05.028 --> 25:07.362
Maybe not because
she was sleeping with him.

25:07.364 --> 25:08.813
I know.

25:08.815 --> 25:10.314
She worked at Virtanen.

25:10.316 --> 25:12.266
She was going
to come out in public--

25:12.268 --> 25:14.819
A scandal involving
one of their drugs.

25:14.821 --> 25:17.321
Not bad,

25:17.323 --> 25:19.106
but it's not the whole story.

25:19.108 --> 25:20.875
She worked in clinical trials.

25:20.877 --> 25:24.328
Five days before she was killed,
she was transferred out.

25:24.330 --> 25:25.780
Access suspended.

25:25.782 --> 25:27.448
How did you come by that?

25:27.450 --> 25:31.669
You have your people.
I have mine.

25:31.671 --> 25:33.120
Let me guess.

25:33.122 --> 25:35.473
You're looking to strike
a deal with Virtanen.

25:35.475 --> 25:37.258
No, not this time.

25:37.260 --> 25:40.261
I thought everyone
had an angle.

25:40.263 --> 25:44.565
I knew this girl once.

25:44.567 --> 25:46.484
Naive.

25:46.486 --> 25:51.572
She got a tough lesson
on the way the world works.

25:51.574 --> 25:54.308
That reminds me of Dana.

25:54.310 --> 25:57.779
Also, they tried to kill you.

25:57.781 --> 26:00.865
Well, there's that, too.

26:04.002 --> 26:06.871
You want to get out of here?

26:06.873 --> 26:09.040
Where are we going?

26:09.042 --> 26:12.260
To do something illegal.

26:22.502 --> 26:25.253
Lieutenant Gilmore.

26:25.255 --> 26:28.156
Almost didn't recognize you
without that cute uniform.

26:28.158 --> 26:29.424
What do you want now?

26:29.426 --> 26:30.509
There's going to be a break-in

26:30.511 --> 26:32.260
at Virtanen Pharmaceuticals
tonight.

26:32.262 --> 26:37.148
I need you to make sure
that the police don't respond.

26:37.150 --> 26:40.352
After this, we're done.

26:47.276 --> 26:49.160
All right, Finch,
our cameras are in place.

26:49.162 --> 26:51.580
I have full coverage.
Proceed.

26:57.870 --> 27:00.655
Hold this.

27:00.657 --> 27:02.424
So these people are
trying to kill you,

27:02.426 --> 27:05.010
and your plan is to break
into their offices.

27:05.012 --> 27:07.345
I prefer the direct approach.

27:07.347 --> 27:09.664
The South entry.
Any guards on the other side?

27:09.666 --> 27:12.667
Two guards on the first floor,
none on the stairwell.

27:12.669 --> 27:14.269
Go ahead.

27:14.271 --> 27:15.637
Going in.

27:15.639 --> 27:18.890
Am I ever going to meet this
imaginary friend?

27:18.892 --> 27:21.977
He's a very private person.

27:21.979 --> 27:24.279
Wait, there's a guard
on the third floor stairs.

27:24.281 --> 27:26.464
He's coming your way.

27:34.457 --> 27:37.125
You're clear.
Go.

27:49.221 --> 27:50.555
You're probably
one of those guys

27:50.557 --> 27:52.307
that can get out of anything
with a paper clip.

27:52.309 --> 27:54.009
Where did you learn this skill?

27:54.011 --> 27:58.013
It's a long story.

27:58.015 --> 28:02.651
Still clear, Mr. Reese.

28:07.658 --> 28:10.241
They deleted Dana Miller's
email and browser history

28:10.243 --> 28:11.443
months ago.

28:11.445 --> 28:13.194
Nothing is ever really
deleted, Mr. Reese.

28:13.196 --> 28:14.579
The pieces are always
out there.

28:14.581 --> 28:16.448
You just got to know
how to put them back together.

28:16.450 --> 28:18.450
Use the recovery software.

28:18.452 --> 28:20.835
All right.

28:35.768 --> 28:36.801
Right there.

28:36.803 --> 28:38.553
She accessed this file
a dozen times

28:38.555 --> 28:42.524
in the days
before she was killed.

28:44.428 --> 28:47.679
Looks like a clinical trial
for the new drug Sylocet.

28:47.681 --> 28:49.547
FDA approved.

28:49.549 --> 28:51.700
But it's been altered.

28:51.702 --> 28:53.368
These are two files
with the same name,

28:53.370 --> 28:55.370
but the older one
is slightly larger.

29:00.944 --> 29:03.011
Six names are missing
from the trail data

29:03.013 --> 29:05.080
that Virtanen submitted
to the FDA.

29:05.082 --> 29:06.998
I need those names,
Mr. Reese.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.185
Here it comes.

29:21.263 --> 29:23.598
They're all dead,
Mr. Reese.

29:23.600 --> 29:24.933
Dead?

29:24.935 --> 29:28.403
Every person on that list
died of heart failure

29:28.405 --> 29:30.488
within a year
of taking the drug.

29:30.490 --> 29:31.806
Lawson must've dropped
them from the study

29:31.808 --> 29:32.991
and paid the locals to hide it.

29:32.993 --> 29:35.476
Their new wonder drug
is a killer.

29:35.478 --> 29:38.113
It's 6 people out of 200.
That's a 3% mortality rate.

29:38.115 --> 29:41.249
If a million people
take that drug,

29:41.251 --> 29:45.486
30,000 can die.

29:45.488 --> 29:49.424
Wait, was is that sound?

29:51.410 --> 29:53.178
Air conditioning.
Why?

29:53.180 --> 29:54.879
That's what I've been missing.

29:54.881 --> 29:56.347
Listen.

29:56.349 --> 29:59.601
Don't talk, don't move.
I need a clean recording.

30:03.139 --> 30:05.223
Perfect.

30:05.225 --> 30:08.009
I'll be in touch.

30:10.679 --> 30:13.698
Well, well, well.

30:13.700 --> 30:17.702
Guess we should
call the cops, huh.

30:17.704 --> 30:19.954
Bad move, lieutenant.

30:19.956 --> 30:22.157
If I can't trust you,
I'll have to destroy you.

30:22.159 --> 30:25.326
Something makes me think
you won't get that chance.

30:25.328 --> 30:28.630
Besides, I held up my end.

30:28.632 --> 30:32.500
You wanted the cops
not to respond?

30:32.502 --> 30:35.170
This is the cops
not responding.

30:41.543 --> 30:44.512
Keeps me up at night,
knowing what our drug has done.

30:44.514 --> 30:46.214
You need to think
very carefully...

30:47.684 --> 30:49.484
You're leaving
me with no choice.

30:49.486 --> 30:53.354
I'm going to go to Keller.

30:53.356 --> 30:57.158
Reese, I think
I've found something.

30:57.160 --> 31:00.061
Mr. Reese?

31:00.063 --> 31:02.280
I told you I'd handle it.

31:02.282 --> 31:03.665
I've got them both.

31:03.667 --> 31:06.567
I'm on my way.

31:10.005 --> 31:14.959
You never did
tell me your name.

31:14.961 --> 31:16.544
John.

31:16.546 --> 31:19.380
My name's John.

31:19.382 --> 31:23.351
Of course it is.

31:23.353 --> 31:24.519
So, John...

31:24.521 --> 31:27.605
How did you know
I was going to be in trouble?

31:27.607 --> 31:30.091
Given your choice of career,

31:30.093 --> 31:34.428
doesn't seem
like much of a stretch.

31:34.430 --> 31:36.648
You might consider
a new line of work.

31:36.650 --> 31:40.268
You're one to judge.

31:40.270 --> 31:44.873
Besides, you don't know
anything about me.

31:44.875 --> 31:47.742
I know almost
everything about you.

31:47.744 --> 31:51.713
I know you grew up
in a nice house in Yonkers.

31:51.715 --> 31:53.581
I know your dad
was a city official

31:53.583 --> 31:57.335
till he got snared
in a corruption case.

31:57.337 --> 32:00.588
I know you spent
the rest of your childhood

32:00.590 --> 32:04.259
in a little apartment
in Queens with your mother.

32:04.261 --> 32:08.496
About the only thing
I don't know about you

32:08.498 --> 32:11.966
is why you started doing
whatever it is you do.

32:17.306 --> 32:21.326
My dad was a party man.

32:21.328 --> 32:24.645
Machine politician.

32:24.647 --> 32:27.782
Did what he was told.

32:27.784 --> 32:31.703
Right up until
the cops showed up,

32:31.705 --> 32:34.539
put the cuffs on him.

32:34.541 --> 32:36.941
The local press was
camped out on our lawn

32:36.943 --> 32:39.093
for weeks.

32:39.095 --> 32:43.298
Then this guy showed up,

32:43.300 --> 32:46.500
the guy that the party
would send to deal with...

32:46.502 --> 32:50.605
Uncomfortable situations.

32:50.607 --> 32:52.506
He said two words.

32:52.508 --> 32:56.144
And those reporters?

32:56.146 --> 32:59.480
They packed up, and they left,

32:59.482 --> 33:01.783
and they never came back.

33:01.785 --> 33:07.572
And I realized,
that's what I want to be.

33:07.574 --> 33:10.742
The person who knows
what to say,

33:10.744 --> 33:15.163
and always has
something to trade.

33:15.165 --> 33:20.418
So what are you
going to trade now?

33:26.175 --> 33:27.642
Yes, it's Mr. Partridge.

33:27.644 --> 33:29.227
I need to speak to Mr. Keller,
immediately.

33:29.229 --> 33:30.345
I'm sorry, sir,

33:30.347 --> 33:31.479
but Mr. Keller
is currently unavailable.

33:31.481 --> 33:32.880
Listen, put him
on the phone right now.

33:32.882 --> 33:34.182
It's extremely urgent.

33:34.184 --> 33:37.936
A matter of life and death.

33:37.938 --> 33:40.939
So we're finally
face-to-face.

33:40.941 --> 33:42.390
You're making a mistake, Mark.

33:42.392 --> 33:44.859
I'm not the one
handcuffed to a chair.

33:44.861 --> 33:46.995
So you saw the Sylocet report?

33:46.997 --> 33:47.996
Hope you don't mind.

33:47.998 --> 33:49.730
I emailed a copy to a friend

33:49.732 --> 33:53.034
so I could read it
more thoroughly.

33:55.671 --> 33:57.372
Okay, so where is it now?

33:57.374 --> 34:00.074
With the only person I trust.

34:00.076 --> 34:03.127
And if anything happens to us,
that report goes public.

34:03.129 --> 34:05.746
Everyone will know
your new drug kills.

34:05.748 --> 34:09.967
What do you think Keller will
do to you when he finds out?

34:09.969 --> 34:11.268
Tell you what.

34:11.271 --> 34:12.603
Since Zoe loves
negotiating so much,

34:12.605 --> 34:15.139
I'll offer you two a deal.

34:15.141 --> 34:18.443
First one to give up
that report gets to live.

34:22.398 --> 34:23.447
I've reached Mr. Keller.

34:23.449 --> 34:24.649
He'll be with you
in just a moment.

34:24.650 --> 34:28.202
Thank you.

34:28.204 --> 34:30.221
You're leaving me
with no choice.

34:30.223 --> 34:31.989
I'm gonna go to Keller.

34:31.992 --> 34:33.458
You want to tell the old man?

34:33.460 --> 34:35.543
Here's your chance.

34:35.545 --> 34:36.944
You think anything
happens in my company

34:36.946 --> 34:38.730
without me knowing it,
young lady?

34:38.732 --> 34:42.382
How stupid do you think I am?

34:42.385 --> 34:43.368
Mr. Partridge?

34:43.370 --> 34:44.619
You're on with Mr. Keller.

34:53.594 --> 34:57.014
Mark, why aren't they dead yet?

34:57.016 --> 35:00.301
She says she has
a copy of the report.

35:00.303 --> 35:01.819
And just when I thought
you could handle

35:01.821 --> 35:04.155
something truly important.

35:07.642 --> 35:11.312
Ms. Morgan,
be reasonable.

35:11.314 --> 35:14.148
Every new drug
has side effects.

35:14.150 --> 35:16.417
That's why
we have disclaimers...

35:16.419 --> 35:18.652
And insurance.

35:18.654 --> 35:23.174
This moral crusade
doesn't suit you.

35:23.176 --> 35:27.678
The Zoe Morgan
I know is reasonable.

35:27.680 --> 35:33.217
Knows when to make
a smart play.

35:35.971 --> 35:38.523
I'll get you the report.

35:40.442 --> 35:42.310
I'll bring you right to it.

35:49.851 --> 35:53.154
Told you.

35:53.156 --> 35:56.407
Always have something to trade.

36:02.081 --> 36:04.298
Let's go.

36:17.664 --> 36:20.632
You know, you really
shouldn't be surprised

36:20.634 --> 36:23.052
by what Zoe did.

36:23.054 --> 36:25.054
Never trusted that bitch.

36:25.056 --> 36:28.807
Always looking for an angle.

36:28.809 --> 36:30.709
Potassium chloride?

36:30.711 --> 36:34.146
Government uses it
for lethal injections.

36:34.148 --> 36:37.483
Stops a heart in minutes.

36:37.485 --> 36:39.401
Quite humanely, really.

36:39.403 --> 36:41.103
Lucky you.

36:41.105 --> 36:45.157
Lucky me?

37:02.626 --> 37:04.960
I'm on my way, now.

37:04.962 --> 37:06.512
The Naval Yard.

37:06.514 --> 37:09.765
Jail rules.
No more phones.

37:09.767 --> 37:12.851
Clever girl.

37:15.139 --> 37:16.221
Finch.

37:16.223 --> 37:18.190
Been trying
to get you for two hours.

37:18.192 --> 37:19.424
Keller's involved.

37:19.426 --> 37:20.709
He and Lawson
worked it together,

37:20.711 --> 37:22.928
up to, and including
Dana's murder.

37:22.930 --> 37:26.264
I know. Keller blindsided us,
and so did Zoe.

37:26.266 --> 37:28.233
She's about
to hand over the copy

37:28.235 --> 37:29.952
of that trial data to Lawson.

37:29.954 --> 37:32.321
You should be more trusting,
Mr. Reese.

37:32.323 --> 37:34.039
Zoe just sent me
her destination.

37:34.041 --> 37:36.942
Naval Yard.
Sound familiar?

37:36.944 --> 37:40.162
- I'm on my way.
- Ready, sir?

37:46.452 --> 37:49.505
Mr. Keller.
Sorry I'm late.

37:49.507 --> 37:51.840
Sorry I started without you,
Mr. Partridge,

37:51.842 --> 37:55.010
but when you're as old as I am,
you can't waste a minute.

37:56.130 --> 37:59.314
What's your poison?

38:06.472 --> 38:08.140
What the hell
are we doing here?

38:08.142 --> 38:13.695
You want your report, right?

38:13.697 --> 38:16.498
He's right over there.

38:16.500 --> 38:18.951
You want me to go get it
or-- or you?

38:25.425 --> 38:29.261
No, I don't think so.
You know what I think?

38:29.263 --> 38:31.797
I don't think you emailed that
report to anybody at all.

38:31.799 --> 38:37.002
In fact, I think it's been right
here all along.

38:38.555 --> 38:41.106
You picked a perfect time
to join us, Mr. Partridge.

38:41.108 --> 38:43.792
Once Sylocet
goes on the market,

38:43.794 --> 38:48.697
you'll never have to
invest in another company again.

38:50.567 --> 38:52.401
If anybody else, you know,
they would have sent

38:52.403 --> 38:56.071
this report to the police
or the press.

38:56.073 --> 38:57.522
But not you.

38:57.524 --> 39:00.409
No, you just couldn't resist
holding onto one more card.

39:00.411 --> 39:02.461
Yup.

39:02.463 --> 39:03.662
So you did send it

39:03.664 --> 39:06.198
to the one person in the world
you could trust.

39:06.200 --> 39:10.219
Yourself.

39:10.221 --> 39:14.640
Now you're going
to take it to the grave.

39:14.642 --> 39:15.974
Let's get the hell out of here.

39:17.928 --> 39:19.411
Zoe!

39:19.413 --> 39:23.015
Ah!

39:23.017 --> 39:24.600
Migraine, huh?

39:24.602 --> 39:28.654
Heard they got a pill
for that now.

39:28.656 --> 39:30.856
Took your time.

39:32.775 --> 39:34.226
And at what point did you know

39:34.228 --> 39:35.861
you were going to do
the right thing?

39:35.863 --> 39:39.731
About two seconds before
I slipped you the paper clip.

39:42.118 --> 39:44.953
Anyway...

39:44.955 --> 39:48.340
Pleasant as it is to talk,
the board and I do need to know

39:48.342 --> 39:50.959
what your...lntentions are,

39:50.961 --> 39:52.911
now that you own
8% of Virtanen.

39:58.918 --> 40:02.804
Actually, I've sold
my shares in Virtanen.

40:02.806 --> 40:06.725
I had a tip that the price
is about to take a nosedive.

40:06.727 --> 40:09.928
Tip? What tip?

40:09.930 --> 40:11.964
That senior management
was about to have

40:11.966 --> 40:14.099
some very serious
legal problems.

40:14.101 --> 40:18.120
In fact, I took
my initial investment,

40:18.122 --> 40:20.539
and I shorted your company...

40:20.541 --> 40:22.991
To the tune of
1/2 billion shares.

40:22.993 --> 40:27.129
If you're betting against me,

40:27.131 --> 40:30.048
you clearly don't know
who you're dealing with.

40:30.050 --> 40:33.969
Oh, I know exactly what
kind of man I'm dealing with.

40:33.971 --> 40:37.472
And I know you don't care who
you hurt to get what you want.

40:37.474 --> 40:42.844
I know the only thing you do
care about is money.

40:42.846 --> 40:46.431
So that's what I'm going
to take from you.

40:46.433 --> 40:49.067
Your money.
All of it.

40:49.069 --> 40:51.903
You were right, Mr. Keller.

40:51.905 --> 40:53.989
Thanks to you,

40:53.991 --> 40:57.909
I never will have to
invest in another company.

41:18.965 --> 41:22.834
Detective Sullivan?

41:22.836 --> 41:25.220
Sully?

41:25.222 --> 41:28.006
It's me, Car--

41:28.008 --> 41:32.227
Oh, no.

41:35.114 --> 41:36.064
Police!

42:00.973 --> 42:02.941
Virtanen CEO Robert Keller

42:02.943 --> 42:04.509
is expected
to appear in court today

42:04.511 --> 42:06.878
alongside CFO and son-in-law,
Mark Lawson.

42:06.880 --> 42:09.147
To answer charges of fraud,
conspiracy, and murder.

42:09.149 --> 42:11.316
Virtanen's migraine drug,
Sylocet,

42:11.318 --> 42:12.984
has officially been shelved.

42:12.986 --> 42:14.319
Virtanen's competitor,
beecher pharmaceuticals...

42:14.321 --> 42:15.937
You mind turning
that off, please?

42:15.939 --> 42:20.192
Sounds like beecher
got an inside tip.

42:20.194 --> 42:22.694
Somebody must have had
a big payday.

42:22.696 --> 42:24.946
Not as big as you think.

42:24.948 --> 42:27.249
Dana Miller's family
got a healthy donation

42:27.251 --> 42:29.701
for their suit against Virtanen.

42:29.703 --> 42:31.403
I also heard that
Lieutenant Gilmore

42:31.405 --> 42:32.504
found himself up against

42:32.506 --> 42:36.007
some pretty serious
corruption charges.

42:36.009 --> 42:39.744
Must have upset someone
pretty influential.

42:43.015 --> 42:45.100
