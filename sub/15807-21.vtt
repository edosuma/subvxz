    and you'll hear a tale ¶

00:06.307 --> 00:08.340
¶ A tale of a fateful trip ¶

00:08.409 --> 00:10.843
¶ That started
    from this tropic port ¶

00:10.911 --> 00:12.744
¶ Aboard this tiny ship ¶

00:12.813 --> 00:15.313

     a mighty sailin' man ¶

00:27.228 --> 00:29.561
¶ The weather started
     getting rough ¶

00:29.630 --> 00:31.663
¶ The tiny ship was tossed ¶

00:31.731 --> 00:34.466
¶ If not for the courage
    of the fearless crew ¶

01:18.078 --> 01:19.577
Don't let him get away,
         Gilligan.

01:19.646 --> 01:22.214
I won't, Skipper.

01:22.282 --> 01:24.716
Give him some slack.

01:24.785 --> 01:28.353
Play with him, Gilligan.
       That's it, play with him.

01:29.389 --> 01:31.223
What a fighter he is.

01:32.259 --> 01:34.226
He must weigh 50 pounds.

01:36.330 --> 01:39.564
- I don't believe it.
     - It's okay, come on.

01:39.633 --> 01:42.101
Open up your mouth and give me
 back the sea shell.

01:43.871 --> 01:45.137
Thank you.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.540
Okay now, oops, here we go.

01:48.608 --> 01:51.076
- Back to school, Irwin.
    - Irwin?

01:51.145 --> 01:53.445
Yeah. He get's real mad
    if I call him "Irw."

01:53.514 --> 01:54.913
- Naturally.
          - Yeah.

01:54.982 --> 01:58.117
He and I are good friends.
I catch him almost every day.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.988
Hey, what's that?

02:03.057 --> 02:04.857
It's a guy on a surf board.

02:05.825 --> 02:07.526
A guy on a surf board?

02:24.578 --> 02:26.978
Gilligan, what is it
you're trying to do?

02:27.047 --> 02:28.313
Artificial respiration.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.148
What? He hasn't swallowed
any water yet.

02:30.217 --> 02:32.817
Maybe, a little sand
the way you've got him.

02:32.886 --> 02:34.353
May I?

02:35.856 --> 02:39.291
Alright, boy, roll over.
You're alright.

02:40.227 --> 02:42.460
Come on, son, you're alright.

02:42.529 --> 02:46.298
You're okay. Don't try and talk
now. Just lie there and rest.

02:46.367 --> 02:47.832
Hey, Professor. Look
            what we found?

02:47.901 --> 02:49.835
I was in a tree
       getting some dates

02:49.903 --> 02:51.603
I saw him come ashore.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.238
Who is he?

02:54.041 --> 02:55.706
Who are you?

02:55.775 --> 02:57.842
- Duke Williams.
       - Where you from?

02:57.911 --> 03:00.745
- Topeka, Kansas.
- Wow, he sure had a long ride.

03:00.814 --> 03:02.647
No, no, no, I mean
where did you start from?

03:02.716 --> 03:06.485
Oh, oh, I caught a 30-foot one
 off Waimea beach.

03:06.553 --> 03:09.454
Waimea beach!
   But that's near Honolulu.

03:09.522 --> 03:11.490
Duke, it is scientifically
absurd to believe that

03:11.559 --> 03:13.825
you could've ridden the same
 wave all the way from Hawaii.

03:13.894 --> 03:16.128
The counter-action of the marine
gravitational force would've--

03:16.196 --> 03:19.264
Slow down, Teachs. I was
  a dropout from second grade.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.433
- I got to slow down.
    - Don't go nowhere, man.

03:21.502 --> 03:24.269
Just stay where you are,
    listen to Big Daddy.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.971
Now, there was
     a large surf makin' up

03:26.039 --> 03:28.439
and me and couple other
  hot-doggers were practicin'

03:28.508 --> 03:30.609
rail-grabs and kick-outs.

03:30.677 --> 03:33.044
Like one Joe is a grimmy,
   he wipes out at the start.

03:33.113 --> 03:35.480
Me, I'm in a nose, right,
   havin' a little trouble

03:35.549 --> 03:39.150
when all of a sudden, I'm out
 of the tube and up on top.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.952
Only, I'm headed
        for open sea.

03:41.020 --> 03:45.089
I mean, I'm ridin' into the
middle of the big salty splash.

03:45.158 --> 03:46.124
You got the picture?

03:46.193 --> 03:47.492
Must've been
        a foreign film.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.394
Let's start
      from the beginning.

03:49.463 --> 03:51.429
How long have you been
     on that board?

03:51.498 --> 03:53.799
- What day this is?
      - Thursday.

03:53.867 --> 03:56.835
I remember swingin' with this
 gidget Saturday night.

03:56.903 --> 03:59.704
And then giving her a fast
   goodbye so me and the guys

03:59.773 --> 04:01.873
could hit the beach
      Sunday morning.

04:01.942 --> 04:04.275
That was five days ago.

04:04.344 --> 04:05.943
Say, you're right.

04:06.012 --> 04:09.013
Professor, he couldn't have been
out more than two or three hours

04:09.082 --> 04:11.516
His friends are probably out
  looking for him right now.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.752
Unless he rode in
       on a tsunami.

04:13.821 --> 04:16.821
No, he came in on a board.
   Skipper and I saw him.

04:16.890 --> 04:19.724
Tsunami is a giant wave caused
 by an underground earthquake

04:19.793 --> 04:22.828
originating in a seismological
 fault off the coast of Japan.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.996
(Duke)
   'Is anybody gonna tell me
   where I am?'

04:25.065 --> 04:28.033
Duke, I'm afraid you're marooned
on an uncharted island.

04:29.302 --> 04:30.902
Not for long, pops.

04:30.971 --> 04:34.506
Give me a couple days,
    and I'm back to Waimea.

04:34.575 --> 04:37.909
We'll fatten you up and put you
on the next tsunami to Hawaii.

04:37.977 --> 04:39.444
And when you get there

04:39.512 --> 04:41.279
don't forget to tell them
   we're marooned here.

04:41.348 --> 04:43.782
Alright.

04:43.851 --> 04:47.852
Professor, a reverse tsunami,
   is that possible?

04:47.921 --> 04:49.187
Not a chance, Skipper.

04:49.255 --> 04:52.924
Ah, that figures, why else would
Gilligan have thought of it.

04:52.992 --> 04:55.560
So, that's the way we ended up
  on this island.

04:55.628 --> 04:57.128
Man, how do you stand it?

04:57.197 --> 04:59.363
It's a little rough
         the first couple months

04:59.432 --> 05:00.899
but you'll get used to it.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.401
Get used to it. I'll go ape.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.002
Just gotta get back
to Hawaii.

05:05.071 --> 05:08.173
Duke, let me tell you something.
There is no way off this island.

05:08.242 --> 05:11.643
Admiral, there are no strings
on a man with a surfboard.

05:11.712 --> 05:14.012
All I gotta do
     is get back in shape.

05:14.080 --> 05:18.449
Five days on that board, and
I'm nothin' but skin and bones.

05:18.518 --> 05:20.052
And what skin.

05:21.255 --> 05:23.322
And what bones.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.691
Ladies, come on in.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.695
Man, you guys ain't lost,
you're hiding.

05:31.865 --> 05:35.333
Duke Williams, this is Ginger
   Grant and Mary Ann Summers.

05:35.401 --> 05:38.036
- Hello.
            - Howdy.

05:38.105 --> 05:40.038
Pleasure's mine.

05:40.107 --> 05:42.674
Gilligan was out fishing,
     and this is what we landed.

05:42.743 --> 05:45.344
Wow, what did you
               use for bait?

05:47.514 --> 05:50.482
Stop dreaming.
     The Duke has arrived.

05:52.019 --> 05:55.987
Oh, I like 'em little,
     and I like' em big.

05:57.624 --> 06:00.058
Man, this is smorgasbroad time.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.096
- Did you say "Duke?"
     - Yeah, Duke.

06:05.165 --> 06:08.866
- Oh, darling, royalty.
 - At last, our kind of people.

06:08.935 --> 06:11.770
I better start over. This Duke
Williams was surfing in Hawaii--

06:11.839 --> 06:13.871
Thurston, where did we meet
the Duke of Williams?

06:13.940 --> 06:15.474
Skeet shooting
             with Prince Philip?

06:15.542 --> 06:18.109
No, that was
the Duke of Albania.

06:18.178 --> 06:21.579
- A-at Monaco with Grace--
  - That was the Duke of Troy.

06:21.648 --> 06:23.715
- Can I say something?
     - 'No, no, Gilligan.'

06:23.784 --> 06:26.251
No time for idle chat and not
with a Duke on the island.

06:26.319 --> 06:29.687
The Duke's first day, we must
   have him for cocktail.

06:29.756 --> 06:34.125
Oh, Thurston. Oh, it's the right
thing at the right time.

06:34.194 --> 06:37.828
No wonder you're always sitting
on the host's right hand.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.697
Isn't that kind
       of uncomfortable?

06:39.766 --> 06:42.566
She is proud of, my boy. Mustn't
keep the Duke in suspense.

06:42.635 --> 06:44.736
Let him know
     the Howells are here.

06:47.107 --> 06:51.977
- Took second place in Waikiki.
- Oh, wow, who took first prize?

06:52.045 --> 06:54.011
The guy who was married
    to the judge.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.080
Oh, dear, you're just
           not appreciated.

06:56.149 --> 06:59.017
Baby, isn't that
       what I always say.

06:59.085 --> 07:02.420
Lady wanted to do a sculpture
 of me like this, once.

07:02.488 --> 07:04.555
Oh, wow. That's you, Duke,
that's you.

07:04.624 --> 07:07.925
Oh, I-I was once painted
    like this..

07:07.994 --> 07:11.162
Say, pretty good set
      of deltoids.

07:11.230 --> 07:12.764
He likes my deltoids.

07:14.734 --> 07:17.835
Hmm, oh, pretty good
      latissimus dorsi.

07:17.904 --> 07:21.239
- He likes my latissimus dorsi.
- Whatever that is!

07:21.307 --> 07:23.074
- You don't know?
       - No.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.776
Why, that's right here.

07:25.845 --> 07:28.813
I remember hot-dogging off
 the coast of Malibu one time.

07:28.882 --> 07:31.416
Suddenly, the surf went out,
  and we were on the beach.

07:31.485 --> 07:34.685
Well, this <i> wahini</i> lays eyes
 on me, but I give her nothing.

07:34.754 --> 07:36.687
I mean, I stand like
      she's nowhere

07:36.756 --> 07:38.723
but she comes on strong.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.726
She won't hold off, but I'm
  cool, reach for the surf..

07:43.964 --> 07:45.797
Did I hurt you?

07:45.866 --> 07:48.365
Little man, you couldn't knock
  a hole in the wind

07:48.434 --> 07:50.569
with a fistful of hammers.

07:52.272 --> 07:54.606
- Ooh!
             - Ooh!

08:00.080 --> 08:02.547
Well, just don't lay there,
  do something.

08:02.615 --> 08:04.049
Anything!

08:04.551 --> 08:06.150
Oh, boy.

08:06.219 --> 08:09.020
Hey, has anybody seen
     the Skipper?

08:09.089 --> 08:12.022
You remember the Skipper,
don't you? He kinda wears a hat?

08:12.091 --> 08:14.893
He's got one big muscle
    right about here.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.199
Oh, well, so long.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.603
Goodbye.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.639
See you later.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.451
- Gilligan, what are you doing?
- Hi, Skipper.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.520
Huh, that is not
the answer.

08:42.589 --> 08:44.322
Huh, I'm trying
              to look like Duke.

08:44.391 --> 08:46.925
He's down at the beach
       with Ginger and Mary Ann.

08:46.994 --> 08:49.694
He's doing this, Skipper,
 and these girls are like "ooh."

08:49.763 --> 08:52.097
You're not going to get anywhere
with empty coconut shell.

08:52.165 --> 08:55.466
I'm starting with those
  to work up to the big stuff.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.737
Okay, little buddy, good luck.
 Let me know how you make out.

08:58.805 --> 09:00.872
You won't recognize me
          when I'm all done.

09:00.941 --> 09:04.208
I'll be as big as this and have
shoulders as big as this

09:04.277 --> 09:06.711
and I'll have a chest
           as big as that.

09:06.780 --> 09:09.347
Except they'd be up
             a little higher.

09:09.415 --> 09:13.284
- Thanks a lot, Gilligan.
   - Oh, I'm sorry, Skipper.

09:13.353 --> 09:15.153
Skipper?

09:16.422 --> 09:18.557
[music]

09:22.795 --> 09:24.896
Alright, girls, go.

09:26.866 --> 09:31.569
'Help somebody, help anybody
  big, help!'

09:31.637 --> 09:33.872
- Excuse me, girls.
      - 'Help.'

09:33.941 --> 09:35.807
Help!

09:37.578 --> 09:40.312
Gilligan, that's no way
    to do a back press.

09:41.648 --> 09:43.681
Is that what
      I was trying to do?

09:43.750 --> 09:46.851
Yes. Now watch me.

09:48.788 --> 09:50.789
It's very simple.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.329
(Duke)
             'See?'

10:00.133 --> 10:01.866
Now you try.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.703
Don't hurt yourself.

10:09.342 --> 10:11.743
Lie down...on your back.

10:14.814 --> 10:16.180
That's it.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.181
You got it?

10:17.250 --> 10:18.783
Yeah, yeah.

10:23.890 --> 10:27.725
- Oh, oh.
 - Man, you just don't listen.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.159
Then you better give up.

10:29.228 --> 10:31.462
You got to have a body
          to do that.

10:31.530 --> 10:35.533
- I got a body, sort of.
  - Ah, here, keep practicing.

10:35.602 --> 10:36.867
Let's go, girls.

10:36.936 --> 10:38.669
Oh, you're not gonna
      leave me here.

10:38.738 --> 10:42.139
Oh, he's gonna leave me.
    He, oh, oh.

10:42.208 --> 10:44.042
Oh, oh.

10:51.885 --> 10:54.318
[knock on door]

10:54.387 --> 10:55.887
<i> Entrer.</i>

10:57.157 --> 11:00.258
- Oh, welcome, Your Highness.
 - Duke.

11:02.228 --> 11:04.995
What's wrong, lady,
you lose something?

11:05.064 --> 11:08.132
Ah, Your Highness, I-I don't
  think we've ever met before?

11:08.201 --> 11:10.067
Now, we do mingle with royalty

11:10.136 --> 11:13.070
especially during grouse-hunting
season. There you are, my dear.

11:13.139 --> 11:15.006
Man, these nuts
come in mixed pairs.

11:15.074 --> 11:17.242
Oh, such a droll
        sense of humor.

11:17.310 --> 11:19.276
Yes, Thurston, that's what
      I thought at first.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.846
But have we known a Duke
        that looked like that?

11:21.915 --> 11:24.182
Can't say much
  for the cut of his clothes.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.984
Probably new Italian style,
  pizza shock skin.

11:27.053 --> 11:28.886
Met some oddballs
in my time

11:28.955 --> 11:31.189
but like you, they let out
a little early.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.858
Don't go away.
I'll get the keeper.

11:33.927 --> 11:36.060
I don't remember any Duke
       acting that badly.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.730
Not since the one
that started World War I.

11:38.798 --> 11:41.466
Sir, I think
you're an imposter.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.034
I am not,
                   I'm a surfer.

11:43.103 --> 11:46.103
I don't think you're a Duke,
  not even a Count or Earl.

11:46.172 --> 11:47.905
I don't even think
      you're a Republican.

11:47.974 --> 11:50.909
Charlie, I'm going.
             You're gone.

11:53.045 --> 11:55.813
Thurston, you were superb.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.849
Well, no one can pull the wool
 over my eyes.

11:58.918 --> 12:01.820
Cashmere maybe,
                 but wool never.

12:04.624 --> 12:05.890
- 182..
           - ...183..

12:05.958 --> 12:07.792
- ...184..
         - Duke, Duke.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.426
I've been looking
       all over for you.

12:09.495 --> 12:12.263
I'm not hard to find, Teach,
  just look for my lovebirds.

12:12.332 --> 12:13.531
- I've got wonderful news.
   - Oh.

12:13.600 --> 12:14.665
[Gilligan moaning]

12:14.734 --> 12:16.667
Gilligan, what's wrong with you?

12:16.736 --> 12:18.369
- I've been exercising.
    - Why?

12:18.438 --> 12:20.037
So I can die healthy.

12:20.106 --> 12:22.907
Stay right here, I've got news
that will brighten up your life.

12:22.975 --> 12:24.943
- Can I lie down and listen?
  - Of course.

12:25.011 --> 12:27.244
Duke, listen. I've been working
on this all day.

12:27.313 --> 12:30.047
There's been a shift in trade
 winds and the tidal forces

12:30.116 --> 12:33.084
compounded by the pull of Sun
causing syzygy with Earth

12:33.153 --> 12:36.321
and made a perfect
coriolis effect.

12:36.389 --> 12:40.291
- Why didn't I think of that?
 - Isn't he wonderful?

12:40.360 --> 12:41.592
It's really very simple.

12:41.661 --> 12:45.396
The tsunami wave will return
in 48 hours headed for Hawaii.

12:45.465 --> 12:48.032
Hey, Duke, that means
  you can get us all rescued.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.768
Yeah, we gotta talk
      about that sometime.

12:50.837 --> 12:52.971
Come on, girls,
       let's take a walk.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.307
Right this way.

12:58.845 --> 13:00.678
Come on, Gilligan,
snap out of this.

13:00.747 --> 13:03.948
Now listen, we've got exactly
48 hours to get him into shape.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.783
We've got to get sugar
into his bloodstream.

13:05.851 --> 13:07.552
We've got to strengthen
his muscles--

13:07.620 --> 13:09.353
- Professor, Professor..
    - What?

13:09.422 --> 13:13.057
While we are building him up,
   they're knocking him down.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.031
[peppy music]

13:35.482 --> 13:37.415
[music continues]

13:54.500 --> 13:57.535
Gilligan, Gilligan,
      are you down there?

13:59.672 --> 14:01.873
You are down there, you..

14:17.690 --> 14:19.157
(Gilligan coughing)

14:19.225 --> 14:22.393
May I ask you a simple question,
and I want a simple answer?

14:22.461 --> 14:24.761
Sure, Skipper,
    that's only kind I know.

14:24.830 --> 14:28.833
Exactly. Now here's my question.
Just what are you trying to do?

14:28.902 --> 14:30.201
I'm trying to learn how to surf

14:30.270 --> 14:34.505
because if I learn how to surf,
we can be rescued.

14:34.573 --> 14:36.340
Little buddy, your heart's
   in the right place.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.242
About your head,
        I don't know.

14:38.310 --> 14:40.311
It takes years to master
one of these.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.446
Get off
before you hurt yourself.

14:42.515 --> 14:44.082
Aye aye, sir.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.226
Oh, Duke, you scared me.

14:56.295 --> 14:58.562
Baby, that's not what
I had in mind.

14:58.631 --> 14:59.898
Oh.

14:59.966 --> 15:02.199
In fact, I've had other things
 on my mind

15:02.268 --> 15:04.101
ever since I set eyes on you.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.870
Well, wh-where's Mary Ann?

15:05.939 --> 15:08.573
Baby, we don't need
a cheering section.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.307
I do, I'm an actress.

15:10.376 --> 15:12.877
Listen, I've heard about you
movie chicks playing it cool

15:12.946 --> 15:15.379
but aren't you carrying
it a little far?

15:15.448 --> 15:19.117
- What do you mean "far?"
 - I'm talking about life, baby.

15:19.185 --> 15:21.885
Now, you take one
long-legged redhead

15:21.954 --> 15:25.022
mixed with tall, handsome,
muscle man

15:25.091 --> 15:28.459
shake well and..

15:28.527 --> 15:29.259
[chuckles]

15:29.328 --> 15:30.895
You got pretty good reflexes.

15:30.964 --> 15:32.964
From Hollywood, I've
        been chased by the best.

15:34.166 --> 15:36.100
Until you've been
caught by me.

15:37.536 --> 15:40.038
Baby, this is not supposed
   to be a track meet.

15:41.541 --> 15:44.509
Come on, Ginger.
    Time for fun and games.

15:48.748 --> 15:51.082
- What's wrong?
        - Duke.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.551
Oh, nothing wrong
with him.

15:53.619 --> 15:54.685
Believe me, Mary Ann.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.520
While we've been admiring
       his muscles

15:56.589 --> 15:57.821
we overlooked his fangs.

15:57.890 --> 15:59.590
Fangs?

15:59.659 --> 16:03.026
Yeah, underneath that bronze
 skin beats the heart of a wolf.

16:03.095 --> 16:04.728
Well, Ginger, maybe
you're too glamorous.

16:04.797 --> 16:05.963
Take me.

16:06.032 --> 16:08.266
I'm more like the girl
who lives next door.

16:08.334 --> 16:10.134
Girl next door, across
   the street, around the corner

16:10.203 --> 16:11.501
wouldn't make
          any difference to him.

16:11.570 --> 16:15.673
Oh, please, he's so tall
and handsome and--

16:15.742 --> 16:17.642
And hungry.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.009
Where are you going?

16:19.078 --> 16:20.311
Think I hear
Duke calling.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.046
- And you're going?
      - Why, certainly.

16:22.114 --> 16:24.581
Good luck.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.017
[sighs]

16:29.555 --> 16:31.422
[sighs]

16:38.264 --> 16:40.164
[clock ticks]

16:47.373 --> 16:49.173
Not bad time
              for a little girl.

16:49.242 --> 16:50.774
Oh, King Kong had
a better approach.

16:50.843 --> 16:54.312
Come on, Ginger, help me move
the chair in front of the door..

16:54.381 --> 16:56.413
He'll huff and puff
        and blow our house down.

16:56.482 --> 16:58.649
We have to do something
to discourage him.

16:58.718 --> 17:01.452
Discourage him? He'd consider
a slap in the face applause. No.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.754
We've got to bring this
         to a higher court.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.289
Mrs. Howell.

17:06.559 --> 17:09.593
Hello, Lovey, my dear.
          Why the knitted brow?

17:09.662 --> 17:11.896
Thurston, the girls came
    to me with a problem

17:11.964 --> 17:14.365
and I must confess,
   I find it very perplexing.

17:14.433 --> 17:15.898
No matter what,
they deserve it.

17:15.968 --> 17:19.270
We're trying to figure how to
get Mr. America on surfboard

17:19.339 --> 17:21.371
and they're doing everything
but give him the keys

17:21.440 --> 17:24.308
to the sorority house,
if he'll stay.

17:24.376 --> 17:26.376
'Girls want him
                 to leave too.'

17:26.444 --> 17:28.111
You mean, they've become
    disenchanted

17:28.180 --> 17:30.381
with that side of beef?

17:30.450 --> 17:33.751
Thurston, I don't know how
      to phrase this, but..

17:33.820 --> 17:35.286
...he's been making advances.

17:35.355 --> 17:37.355
You mean, to both
of them at once?

17:37.423 --> 17:40.458
- Ooh, how vulgar!
     - Yes, and how young.

17:40.526 --> 17:42.726
You know something, that
Duke Williams reminds me

17:42.795 --> 17:45.596
of Montmorency Vandergrift.

17:45.664 --> 17:47.965
Thurston, Montmorency wasn't
    as bad as all that.

17:48.034 --> 17:49.901
Well, he did sit
a good horse

17:49.969 --> 17:51.535
but nowadays,
that's not quite enough.

17:51.604 --> 17:54.405
Well, anyway, I got rid of him
  once and for all.

17:54.474 --> 17:57.108
Lovey, my dear, I know
that we made a pledge.

17:57.177 --> 17:59.310
Never to delve into our past

17:59.378 --> 18:01.111
but I think
              we should break it

18:01.180 --> 18:04.248
just this once
            for the good of all.

18:04.317 --> 18:08.786
- What past, darling?
  - Your past, just this once.

18:08.854 --> 18:11.788
I really don't think I know
what you're talking about.

18:11.857 --> 18:14.725
Tell me, what underhanded trick
 did you use

18:14.794 --> 18:18.061
to get rid
     of Montmorency Vandergrift?

18:18.130 --> 18:19.696
[both chuckle]

18:19.765 --> 18:22.266
Professor, somehow, someway,
  we've got to get Duke

18:22.335 --> 18:23.734
on that surfboard tomorrow.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.802
We've got to offer him
       something more attractive

18:25.871 --> 18:27.271
than Ginger and Mary Ann.

18:27.340 --> 18:30.707
How about a motorcycle
and a crash helmet, huh?

18:30.776 --> 18:33.544
We must have a talk
 about the birds and the bees.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.379
What would Duke want
with birds and bees?

18:35.447 --> 18:38.582
- Some other time.
       - Gentlemen.

18:38.651 --> 18:41.585
Wynken, Blynken,
      and Nod still stuck

18:41.654 --> 18:45.055
blocked by a simple problem.
  Huh, poor shame.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.492
And I suppose that
    you have it all solved.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.326
Naturally, you think
      that country bumpkin

18:49.395 --> 18:51.395
is any match
    for Thurston Howell III?

18:51.464 --> 18:53.097
I bet it's sneaky
and complicated.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.565
Sneaky, naturally.

18:54.634 --> 18:57.235
But complicated,
   let me tell you something.

18:57.303 --> 19:00.237
It's as simple as taking
    candy away from a baby.

19:00.305 --> 19:02.173
It's <i> elementary.</i>

19:03.208 --> 19:04.875
- Hello, captain.
       - Hi, Duke.

19:04.944 --> 19:07.011
Hey, she really waxes up good.

19:07.079 --> 19:08.512
Ah, no rush, Daddy-O.

19:08.581 --> 19:12.650
I might be in shape for a little
exercise in a week or two.

19:12.718 --> 19:13.884
A week or two?

19:13.952 --> 19:17.388
Oh, but there's a big wave
tomorrow at 7, that tsunami!

19:17.457 --> 19:19.590
Everybody on this island
        got ear trouble?

19:19.659 --> 19:21.959
Man, I'm in no shape
            for a tsunami.

19:22.028 --> 19:23.494
Well, that's odd.

19:23.562 --> 19:27.230
Few minutes ago, thought I heard
Ginger say you were leaving.

19:27.299 --> 19:28.566
That Ginger is an odd one.

19:28.634 --> 19:31.235
She's one chick,
         sure plays hard to get.

19:32.405 --> 19:35.506
- Not with the Professor.
   - Professor?

19:35.574 --> 19:37.909
Well, I just saw them
both back there.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.714
Sure, you're not angry at me?

19:43.783 --> 19:46.717
Don't give it
         a second thought, dear.

19:46.786 --> 19:50.254
It was so stupid of me to pay
so much attention to Duke.

19:50.323 --> 19:53.223
I mean, all he does is talk
about his muscles

19:53.292 --> 19:55.526
'and you've got brains.'

19:55.595 --> 19:57.962
'How perfectly wonderful
    you are.'

19:58.030 --> 19:59.931
An extremely high IQ.

20:01.600 --> 20:06.070
- Say it for me once again.
  - An extremely high IQ.

20:06.138 --> 20:08.238
No, I meant the name
of the star.

20:08.307 --> 20:10.841
Oh, Alpha Centauri.

20:10.910 --> 20:14.278
Oh...that's so romantic.

20:17.316 --> 20:20.017
(Professor)
'It's 4 and 3/10ths light years
from the Earth.'

20:20.086 --> 20:22.920
(Ginger)
   'You don't know what a man
   with brains does to me.'

20:22.989 --> 20:26.290
- Capital of North Dakota?
   - Bismarck.

20:26.358 --> 20:29.327
- Oh, South Dakota?
      - Pierre.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.631
Lucky, Pierre.

20:38.571 --> 20:41.705
¶ Oh, it's a long, long way
  to Hawaii ¶

20:41.774 --> 20:44.575
¶ But we're going
       to go anyway ¶

20:44.644 --> 20:47.244
¶ It's a long, long way
    to Hawaii ¶

20:47.312 --> 20:50.113
¶ But Duke will
        make it anyway ¶

20:50.182 --> 20:51.115
¶ Ah ¶

20:51.183 --> 20:52.583
Oh, hi, Duke.

20:52.651 --> 20:54.618
Nice night
for a walk, isn't it?

20:54.687 --> 20:56.019
You want to know
             something, Captain?

20:56.088 --> 20:58.722
Why, I'm always interested
in gathering information.

20:58.791 --> 21:01.992
A redhead is a fickle piece
  of chick, and that's for sure.

21:02.061 --> 21:05.629
You know, something? It's only
the brunettes you can trust.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.431
Just like I was telling
         Mary Ann

21:07.500 --> 21:09.033
before she turned in
            for the night.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.268
- Oh, she's not in her hut.
  - She's not?

21:11.337 --> 21:12.736
Right now,
she's with Gilligan.

21:12.805 --> 21:16.407
- With Gilligan?
    - In their usual place.

21:18.844 --> 21:20.778
[humming]

21:24.283 --> 21:26.817
- Oh, Duke was so bumpy.
    - Is that bad?

21:26.886 --> 21:28.852
- Well, I like little muscles.
 - Oh.

21:28.921 --> 21:29.953
What's wrong?

21:30.022 --> 21:32.256
Think you're taking the crease
out of my knees.

21:32.324 --> 21:35.659
- Wonderfully knobby knees.
- Yeah, but it's time to change.

21:35.728 --> 21:37.728
And I got such
    wonderful knobby elbows too.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.930
(Mary Ann)
     'Spindly skinny arms.'

21:39.998 --> 21:41.632
(Gilligan)
       'Skin and bones,
       what I got most.'

21:41.701 --> 21:43.167
(Mary)
      'I hate muscle men.'

21:43.235 --> 21:46.436
I like underdeveloped, underfed,
undernourished men like you.

21:46.505 --> 21:48.772
[Gilligan chuckles]

21:48.841 --> 21:50.708
Darling, you even have
skinny lips.

21:51.777 --> 21:54.712
Darling, t-take it easy,
        you'll break me.

21:54.781 --> 21:56.714
Gilligan, can't you be
little more romantic?

21:56.783 --> 21:57.748
Okay.

21:57.816 --> 21:58.449
[buzzing]

21:58.517 --> 22:00.050
What are you doing?

22:00.119 --> 22:02.887
Don't know, got something
  to do with the birds and bees.

22:05.625 --> 22:06.991
Here are your provisions, Duke.

22:07.059 --> 22:09.760
Now, remember. Tell 'em our
position is approximately

22:09.829 --> 22:12.196
110 degrees longitude
and 10 degrees latitude.

22:12.264 --> 22:13.731
Okay, okay

22:13.799 --> 22:16.299
but that's all I'm gonna
     remember about this island.

22:16.368 --> 22:17.868
Oh, he fell for it.

22:17.937 --> 22:20.871
[water sloshing]

22:23.776 --> 22:26.276
Oh, dear, isn't it a shame
      he isn't a Duke?

22:26.345 --> 22:28.579
At the moment, I'm glad
he is a surfer.

22:32.718 --> 22:34.852
- Gilligan.
         - You want me?

22:36.055 --> 22:37.154
No, Gilligan.

22:37.223 --> 22:39.356
I called you because
     I want the Professor.

22:39.425 --> 22:40.658
Okay.

22:42.094 --> 22:45.295
Take the binoculars, get up that
tree, tell us what he's doing.

22:45.364 --> 22:46.831
Aye aye, sir.

22:47.633 --> 22:50.567
Wait a minute.

22:50.636 --> 22:52.770
- Here.
          - Yes, sir.

22:53.238 --> 22:54.705
[sighs]

22:59.144 --> 23:00.511
Wow!

23:02.481 --> 23:03.947
Wow!

23:04.016 --> 23:07.451
Gilligan, wow, wow, wow
   doesn't tell us anything.

23:07.520 --> 23:10.054
- Give us a report.
      - Aye aye, sir.

23:11.524 --> 23:14.724
There he is.
      Ooh, he's up on top.

23:14.793 --> 23:17.961
(Gilligan)
'Now, he's down at the bottom.'

23:18.030 --> 23:19.429
Yes, there he is.

23:19.498 --> 23:21.899
(Gilligan)
    'Oh, he's on a big one.'

23:21.967 --> 23:24.067
'Oh, ride 'em, Duke.
      Keep with 'em, boy.'

23:24.136 --> 23:25.469
'Oh, there he goes.'

23:25.537 --> 23:27.705
He's on his way,
        I'm coming down.

23:27.774 --> 23:30.908
Well, he's made it. Now it's
 only a matter of time, Gilli..

23:33.412 --> 23:34.611
Skipper, did I hurt you?

23:34.680 --> 23:36.246
No, Gilligan,
you didn't hurt me.

23:36.315 --> 23:39.784
I'm used to having people fall
out of trees on top of me.

23:47.493 --> 23:49.894
Thanks a lot, Gilligan.

23:55.468 --> 23:57.034
(man on radio)
     'Ladies and gentlemen'

23:57.103 --> 23:59.402
'there has been a week-long
 search for a missing surfer.'

23:59.471 --> 24:03.173
'Well, this afternoon, he was
 found, and we have him here.'

24:03.242 --> 24:06.810
- 'You're Duke Williams, right.'
- 'Yeah, think so.'

24:06.879 --> 24:08.111
- He made it.
         - Shh.

24:08.180 --> 24:10.214
'Can you tell us
     about your adventure?'

24:10.282 --> 24:12.716
(Duke on radio)
     'Well, I hit this rock
     when I beached and..'

24:12.785 --> 24:16.486
'Duke, what about the two weeks
you were gone, where were you?'

24:16.555 --> 24:18.288
Here goes the best part,
    about us.

24:18.357 --> 24:19.790
Gilligan, will you be quiet?

24:19.859 --> 24:21.425
'I'm sorry, ladies
       and gentlemen'

24:21.494 --> 24:24.127
'but the doctor is taking Duke
 back to his hospital room.'

24:24.196 --> 24:26.163
'I'm afraid
   the two-week-old mystery'

24:26.232 --> 24:28.131
'will stay a mystery forever.'

24:28.200 --> 24:31.335
'When Duke Williams hit that
rock, he developed amnesia.'

24:31.404 --> 24:34.238
'He can't remember
 where he was or what he did.'

24:36.042 --> 24:39.309
Amnesia. Well, our luck
is still holding up.

24:39.378 --> 24:41.411
I was so sure
                we'd be rescued.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.046
That's the way it goes.

24:43.115 --> 24:47.750
Sometimes the surf is up,
and sometimes the surf is down.

24:47.819 --> 24:49.486
And just what does that mean?

24:49.555 --> 24:52.556
Don't know, I'm still trying to
figure out the birds and bees.

25:04.036 --> 25:05.803
¶ Now this is the tale
     of the castaways ¶

25:05.872 --> 25:07.837
¶ They're here
    for a long, long time ¶

25:07.906 --> 25:10.406
¶ They'll have to make
     the best of things ¶

25:10.475 --> 25:12.008
¶ It's an uphill climb ¶

25:12.077 --> 25:14.344
¶ The first mate
     and his Skipper too ¶

25:14.413 --> 25:16.046
¶ Will do their very best ¶

25:16.114 --> 25:18.448
¶ To make the
      others comfortable ¶

25:18.517 --> 25:20.283
¶ In the tropic island nest ¶

25:20.352 --> 25:22.819
¶ No phone, no lights,
     no motorcars ¶

25:22.888 --> 25:24.754
¶ Not a single luxury ¶

25:24.823 --> 25:26.890
¶ Like Robinson Crusoe ¶

25:26.959 --> 25:29.159
¶ It's primitive as can be ¶

25:29.227 --> 25:31.795
¶ So join us here
     each week my friends ¶

25:31.864 --> 25:33.864
¶ You're sure to get a smile ¶

25:33.932 --> 25:35.899
¶ From seven
      stranded castaways ¶

25:35.968 --> 25:38.068
¶ Here on Gilligan's isle ¶
