00:17.833 --> 00:19.033
(SUE SPEAKING)

00:25.333 --> 00:26.700
(ENGINE STOPS)

00:28.067 --> 00:30.600
NARRATOR: Sue Aikens recently
purchased a loader,

00:30.667 --> 00:32.900
a vital piece of equipment
to maintain her camp.

00:32.967 --> 00:35.067
SUE: Well, Little Betsy,
it's you and me now.

00:35.833 --> 00:39.600
But during her 86-mile journey
from Deadhorse to Kavik...

00:45.100 --> 00:47.700
The vehicle got stuck
in deep snow and ice,

00:47.767 --> 00:49.533
and she was forced
to call for rescue

00:49.600 --> 00:51.467
and ship the loader
across the tundra.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.367
SUE: All right,
see you in Kavik.

00:54.700 --> 00:59.367
NARRATOR: With the convoy
13 miles out from Kavik
and conditions worsening,

00:59.433 --> 01:01.867
Sue must head out and steer
them away from overflow

01:01.933 --> 01:04.500
to make sure the crew
and loader reach camp safely.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.400
SUE: It's a safety issue.

01:07.767 --> 01:12.700
You're not gonna find overflow
on any map, on any GPS.

01:13.567 --> 01:15.333
But I know it's there,

01:15.400 --> 01:17.367
so they're close enough,
I'm just gonna go
help 'em out.

01:17.433 --> 01:18.767
Let's keep going.

01:33.167 --> 01:34.167
Argh!

01:36.233 --> 01:37.567
(THEME SONG PLAYING)

02:00.533 --> 02:03.667
My helmet is fogging
and icing up.

02:03.733 --> 02:07.033
With it not working,
it's really hard
for me to see.

02:07.700 --> 02:10.233
Hard for me to distinguish
the white from the fog,

02:10.300 --> 02:11.400
from the snow that's blowing,

02:11.500 --> 02:13.133
from what's happening
in my helmet.

02:13.500 --> 02:16.367
Right now, I could go probably
200 yards away from 'em,

02:16.933 --> 02:18.200
and not see it.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.800
We could be two ships
passing in the night.

02:22.400 --> 02:25.200
If I lose my way,

02:25.267 --> 02:26.933
and I can't see,

02:27.000 --> 02:28.400
I could get myself
into trouble.

02:28.867 --> 02:31.167
That's not gonna help
the situation.

02:32.633 --> 02:36.033
Important for me to get
that loader here safely,
the guys here safely.

02:36.100 --> 02:39.767
But I can't jeopardize
my life to get out there.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.700
Once I have to lift that visor
up like that,

02:48.767 --> 02:50.967
it's, you know, 20,
25 below zero.

02:51.033 --> 02:55.033
When the wind is beating you,
I can lose my eyesight,
my fingers.

02:55.100 --> 02:56.367
It's not worth it.

03:00.367 --> 03:02.833
GLENN:
It takes knowledge to live
out here in this environment,

03:02.900 --> 03:04.800
and it takes different kinds
of knowledge.

03:15.433 --> 03:19.067
Right up here,
caribou like to travel
along that ridge.

03:19.133 --> 03:21.933
And a lot of times,
I'll spot them from
down here on the lake.

03:22.533 --> 03:24.700
By the time I get up there,
they're already gone.

03:25.100 --> 03:28.133
I want to go up there
and see if I can find a place
where there's enough snow

03:28.200 --> 03:29.967
to build some type
of snow shelter.

03:30.633 --> 03:32.667
Caribou are very important
animal to me.

03:32.900 --> 03:35.800
They make up about half of the
meat that I eat every year.

03:36.267 --> 03:38.733
With a snow cave, I'll be able
to spend the night up there,

03:38.800 --> 03:40.600
and wait for the caribou
to come to me.

03:40.867 --> 03:42.233
All right, I'm off.

03:46.833 --> 03:48.667
Being able to stand
on your own,

03:48.733 --> 03:50.700
being independent,
being able to take care
of yourself

03:50.767 --> 03:52.400
is a very important
part of this lifestyle.

03:52.467 --> 03:53.567
It's not for everybody.

03:53.633 --> 03:56.067
Some people rather
wouldn't have to.

03:56.133 --> 03:59.267
Some people would rather be
able to turn to somebody else
for help when they need it.

03:59.333 --> 04:03.133
I'd rather have the
challenge of having
to take care of myself.

04:04.300 --> 04:05.900
You can deal with
a lot on your own,

04:05.967 --> 04:07.267
and you'll feel better
when you do.

04:08.600 --> 04:09.900
Here it starts to
get really steep.

04:09.967 --> 04:11.700
I'm gonna take
my snowshoes off here.

04:15.133 --> 04:16.600
I'll leave my snowshoes
right here.

04:16.667 --> 04:18.733
It's gonna be too steep
up higher to use 'em.

04:27.167 --> 04:28.867
Just got to plough through it.

04:32.467 --> 04:34.000
I'm getting up
a little higher.

04:34.067 --> 04:36.667
Snow is getting really
deep here though.

04:36.733 --> 04:38.167
It's hard to get through.

04:40.267 --> 04:41.733
Just one step at a time.

04:46.300 --> 04:47.867
Fresh wolf track right here.

04:49.433 --> 04:52.567
They come up here 'cause it's
good caribou hunting up here.

04:52.633 --> 04:54.233
That's why I came up here too.

04:58.533 --> 05:00.000
Hey, here's a little drift.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.900
Could be big enough.
It's hard to tell.

05:06.267 --> 05:08.133
It looks about six feet deep.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.633
I'm standing on some rock.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.767
I don't know if the rock
goes up there or not.

05:12.133 --> 05:14.067
I want to dig into it a little
ways to see how it goes.

05:14.133 --> 05:16.633
I've never built
a snow cave before,
so I'm gonna try it.

05:16.833 --> 05:18.633
This would be
an ideal location.

05:18.700 --> 05:21.900
I'll be able to spend a lot
more time up on this ridge
watching for caribou.

05:22.200 --> 05:25.067
It's just a question of,
is there enough snow here

05:25.133 --> 05:29.800
that I can excavate a cavity
big enough to fit in
without it all collapsing.

05:35.533 --> 05:38.400
CHIP: Sometimes, taking
the long way is the best way,
'cause it's the smooth way.

05:56.367 --> 05:59.600
NARRATOR:
After harvesting enough
muskox to feed their family,

05:59.900 --> 06:01.333
Chip and Agnes Hailstone

06:01.400 --> 06:03.933
are preparing
to tow the meat supply
home to Noorvik.

06:08.333 --> 06:10.733
CHIP: One more.
One, two, three, up.

06:11.333 --> 06:13.967
Today, we're gonna
be heading home
towards Noorvik

06:14.033 --> 06:16.267
and leave
our Kiwalik camp
just the way it is.

06:16.500 --> 06:18.067
We plan on coming back here.

06:18.233 --> 06:20.700
We want to make sure
we get the meat
all the way to Noorvik,

06:20.767 --> 06:22.900
that's our main goal
is the meat

06:22.967 --> 06:24.733
because, if we leave
the meat out here,

06:24.833 --> 06:29.100
and we don't get right back
to it, there's other animals
and predators out there

06:29.167 --> 06:31.133
that'll just go take
all that free meal.

06:31.267 --> 06:33.500
My snow machine's
broken down for now

06:33.567 --> 06:35.433
and it's not gonna be
any use out here,

06:35.500 --> 06:37.633
so we're gonna just end up
towing it home,

06:37.700 --> 06:39.700
along with a sled-load
of meat.

06:41.533 --> 06:43.467
NARRATOR:
With one snow machine down,

06:43.533 --> 06:48.033
the Hailstones will be forced
to tow their broken vehicle
along with the sled.

06:48.100 --> 06:50.267
Dragging such a heavy load
across the tundra

06:50.333 --> 06:52.267
with one snow machine
will be dangerous.

06:56.633 --> 06:59.033
CHIP: We need to
take your belt off
because we don't...

06:59.100 --> 07:02.867
We need to be able
to, uh, drag this thing in
without moving the motor.

07:03.567 --> 07:06.600
So when you take the belt off,
just the track moves.

07:06.967 --> 07:08.333
CHIP: No resistance that way.

07:08.700 --> 07:11.400
Well, that's the reason
why I always make sure
there's two machines.

07:11.467 --> 07:13.433
What if we'd only come out
on this one?

07:13.633 --> 07:16.267
We wouldn't have
a sled-load of meat.
You know what I mean?

07:16.333 --> 07:19.100
This one just wants to
overheat, and overheat,
and overheat, didn't use it.

07:19.167 --> 07:20.700
And now it's time
to take it home.

07:20.767 --> 07:23.633
We're not skunked
by any means.
It's just this dang engine.

07:30.533 --> 07:34.000
Basically what I'm doing is
towing home my wife's machine
'cause it got a bum engine.

07:34.067 --> 07:36.233
I had a load of meat
on the sled,

07:36.300 --> 07:37.800
so I tied a really strong rope

07:38.800 --> 07:41.000
to the last two
of my crosspieces,

07:41.833 --> 07:44.967
and I've got it over here
on the right side of my sled.

07:45.033 --> 07:47.333
I tied the rope to the left
side of the snow machine.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.967
I can't control the momentum
of the snow machine behind me,

07:50.033 --> 07:52.500
but I can brake slowly
and come to a halt slowly.

07:52.567 --> 07:54.567
If I had this sled behind
the snow machine,

07:54.633 --> 07:56.667
it would be a lot more
uncontrolled weight

07:56.733 --> 08:00.633
that I'd really have to be
leery of coming in behind and
smashing into me and Agnes.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.100
Snow machine
will do its thing.

08:02.167 --> 08:03.600
You're gonna have to keep
an eye on it for me, though,

08:03.667 --> 08:05.500
-keep looking back, okay?
-Yep.

08:06.233 --> 08:08.100
AGNES: Everything
points toward home.

08:08.167 --> 08:11.000
Broken down snow machines,
we got a load of meat.

08:11.067 --> 08:12.167
Kids are home.

08:12.233 --> 08:14.667
Our goal is to get
the meat home.

08:14.733 --> 08:16.200
We can shed the snow machine,

08:16.267 --> 08:17.567
we can shed
all the other stuff,

08:17.633 --> 08:19.867
but, uh, me, Chip and the meat
must get home.

08:20.233 --> 08:22.733
It's a long ways
and it's, uh, adventure,

08:22.800 --> 08:24.533
and we love to do this
every single year.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.800
And every time we do it,
it's always different.

08:32.033 --> 08:33.967
ANDY: I believe
that experience is knowledge,

08:34.533 --> 08:36.067
and if you don't get out
and do things,

08:36.133 --> 08:37.300
if you don't make mistakes,

08:37.367 --> 08:38.567
you don't get that knowledge.

08:45.167 --> 08:49.367
This winter, I had kind of
a major malfunction
with my, uh, wind turbine.

08:49.433 --> 08:51.467
I lost one of my blades
off of it,

08:51.533 --> 08:54.500
so my wind turbine's
been pretty much
down most of the winter.

08:54.567 --> 08:58.633
The big challenge for me
right now is gonna be
getting my bulldozer started,

08:58.700 --> 09:00.167
so that I have something
heavy enough

09:00.233 --> 09:02.400
that I can lower this tower
down with it.

09:02.467 --> 09:03.933
You know, if I can get
this working again,

09:04.000 --> 09:06.867
it's gonna ease my mind
and make life more efficient

09:06.933 --> 09:08.467
and, uh,

09:08.533 --> 09:10.733
you know, I'm gonna be back,
back off-grid,

09:10.800 --> 09:12.067
and that's what I want.

09:13.633 --> 09:16.700
NARRATOR: In winter,
Andy Bassich relies
on his wind turbine

09:16.767 --> 09:19.000
to power his camp
along the Yukon River.

09:19.667 --> 09:21.800
Fixing the device is crucial,

09:21.867 --> 09:26.200
but doing so will require him
to get another key piece
of equipment up and running.

09:28.333 --> 09:29.367
Well, the main thing
I got to do,

09:29.433 --> 09:31.300
is get these batteries
charged up.

09:31.967 --> 09:34.800
Try and get some heat
to these batteries too,

09:34.867 --> 09:36.567
'cause batteries
don't like cold weather.

09:36.700 --> 09:38.900
The warmer I can get these,

09:38.967 --> 09:42.100
the better I'm gonna get
performance and that's
gonna be the main thing.

09:42.167 --> 09:46.000
Can I get this engine to
turn over quick enough to
get it going and everything?

09:46.067 --> 09:48.567
Pump as much heat underneath
this thing as I can,

09:48.633 --> 09:51.500
warm up the engine,
warm up the fuel system.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.300
The hotter I can get it,
the better chance I have
for getting this thing going.

09:55.367 --> 09:57.233
(ENGINE STARTS)

09:57.300 --> 09:59.200
Yeah, buddy,
that's started good.

10:01.367 --> 10:02.767
Better go get my canopy.

10:08.700 --> 10:10.133
I'll stretch this thing out.

10:10.200 --> 10:13.267
It's really big.
It should cover the
bulldozer pretty good,

10:13.733 --> 10:15.000
and hold that heat in.

10:16.267 --> 10:17.867
All right, I'm making heat.

10:17.933 --> 10:19.000
It's all puffy.

10:19.700 --> 10:20.733
That's good.

10:23.167 --> 10:26.600
Think I'll go and get started
shovelling out now.

10:26.833 --> 10:30.867
Got a lot of cables and pipe
and everything to dig out,

10:30.933 --> 10:33.333
so I think that's next
on the agenda here.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.600
We'll let this thing heat up,

10:35.667 --> 10:37.167
and, uh,

10:37.233 --> 10:39.933
check it out later.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.767
It's really kind of critical
to me to get this going again.

10:42.833 --> 10:46.467
I don't like the idea
of having to burn generators
all the time.

10:46.533 --> 10:47.967
I like to be self-sufficient,

10:48.033 --> 10:50.333
I like to use
what the land has to offer,

10:50.400 --> 10:53.833
and I like to be creative in
how I live my life out here.

10:53.900 --> 10:56.733
That's what makes
it all worthwhile.
That's my payoff.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.700
So I guess we'll just see if
it's gonna kick over or not.

11:09.833 --> 11:12.533
That's gonna depend
on the battery,
more than likely.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.433
If I can't get
that bulldozer going,

11:14.500 --> 11:18.133
this is gonna turn
into a completely
different project for me,

11:18.200 --> 11:20.000
because I'm gonna have
to be very, very creative

11:20.067 --> 11:22.933
in how I get this thing down
and back up safely.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.600
So it all kind of hinges on
the bulldozer right now.

11:28.500 --> 11:29.667
(IGNITION CLICKING)

11:30.200 --> 11:31.467
That's not good.

11:45.600 --> 11:46.967
(IGNITION FIRING)

11:48.800 --> 11:49.900
(ENGINE STARTING)

11:50.700 --> 11:51.800
Yeah, buddy!

11:51.967 --> 11:53.533
I got lucky
that thing started up.

11:53.600 --> 11:55.200
I wasn't expecting
that at all.

11:55.267 --> 11:58.133
I figured it was
gonna be a real battle
to get that thing going.

11:59.367 --> 12:01.600
The hard part's done
right now, I think.

12:01.667 --> 12:03.400
We got my bulldozer going.

12:03.933 --> 12:07.167
So the next thing
I gotta do is start lowering
the tower some.

12:10.733 --> 12:14.167
This is the line
that's gonna end up, uh,
lowering down the tower.

12:17.167 --> 12:19.700
It's gonna wanna flip down
pretty quick here.

12:19.767 --> 12:21.767
There it goes right there.

12:21.833 --> 12:25.600
All the weight's on the dozer,
so I should have pretty good
control with the dozer I hope.

12:26.767 --> 12:30.333
Slow control is what you want
when you're doing
something like this.

12:30.400 --> 12:31.967
No speed, no momentum.

12:32.033 --> 12:34.233
Just the opposite
of what you do with dogs.

12:34.600 --> 12:37.900
If this thing starts
coming down and hits,

12:37.967 --> 12:39.400
then, game over.

12:44.267 --> 12:46.433
The whole mechanism
failed here.

12:46.500 --> 12:50.033
The metal broke,
the part that's supporting it.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.000
That's a major failure.

12:54.467 --> 12:56.200
It's wearing
on the metal here.

12:56.700 --> 12:59.567
Probably when
that blade came off,
it tweaked everything.

12:59.900 --> 13:03.200
I managed to get the pole,
the whole tower to come down.

13:03.767 --> 13:06.433
Um, it came down pretty good,

13:06.500 --> 13:08.067
and, uh,

13:08.133 --> 13:10.333
right now, it's resting
on a couple of barrels.

13:10.400 --> 13:12.200
It looks like the unit,

13:12.267 --> 13:15.333
where it connects up
a bunch of metal,
fatigued and broke,

13:15.400 --> 13:17.567
so, pretty major repair,
it looks like.

13:17.633 --> 13:21.767
Hoping I have everything
I need so that I can get it
repaired fairly quickly

13:21.833 --> 13:23.133
and get it back up
and operating.

13:27.100 --> 13:28.500
SUE: The weather
is king out here.

13:28.733 --> 13:30.567
You can lay all your plans in

13:30.633 --> 13:33.000
and Mother Nature
will take you right down to
your knees in a heartbeat.

13:38.833 --> 13:41.933
The visibility is so poor,
they could be 200 yards away,

13:42.000 --> 13:43.633
I would not be able
to see them.

13:44.467 --> 13:46.667
NARRATOR: With her loader
on its way to Kavik,

13:46.733 --> 13:48.333
Sue attempted to meet
the convoy

13:48.400 --> 13:49.933
to guide them to camp safely.

13:50.433 --> 13:53.067
But dangerous conditions
forced her to return home,

13:53.567 --> 13:57.433
and checking on the
status and safety of the
delivery crew is a priority.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.333
SUE: Hecka cold.
I mean, coming in,

14:00.933 --> 14:03.700
we dropped in
temperature severely.

14:04.233 --> 14:07.067
In the end, I mean, I feel bad
that I didn't get out there,

14:07.133 --> 14:10.833
but, uh, I'm not gonna be much
help to anybody

14:10.900 --> 14:12.500
if I can't keep myself safe.

14:15.933 --> 14:17.100
Holy crap.

14:18.300 --> 14:20.867
You don't really want to rub
your hands together,
but I'm cold.

14:21.533 --> 14:26.133
I personally haven't frozen
my fingers that hard,
I don't think, ever.

14:26.567 --> 14:27.567
I better go call Jim.

14:29.233 --> 14:30.367
(SIGHS)

14:31.700 --> 14:32.700
(LINE RINGING)

14:33.200 --> 14:35.067
Hey, buddy, how you doing?

14:35.133 --> 14:36.833
JIM: I'm good, yourself?

14:36.900 --> 14:40.767
Oh, man, you know,
I went out there and tried
to meet up with the convoy

14:40.833 --> 14:45.133
and it's so damn foggy,
I don't even have 200 yards
of visibility.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.067
-And...
-That sucks.

14:47.133 --> 14:49.000
Yeah, so I went four
or five miles,

14:49.067 --> 14:53.167
and I'm like, "Fuck this shit,
man, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
get, uh, frostbite.

14:53.233 --> 14:54.800
"And that won't help
anybody out."

14:54.867 --> 14:56.833
-Well, I just talked to him.
-Okay.

14:56.900 --> 15:00.233
And I figure they're
between three and five miles
away from you.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.333
All right, buddy, well,
I'll keep an eye out for 'em

15:02.400 --> 15:03.867
and I'll just send you
an e-mail then

15:03.933 --> 15:05.633
when they get in,
just so you know.

15:06.133 --> 15:08.767
-All right, thank you, Suzy.
-All righty.
Talk to you later.

15:11.233 --> 15:12.467
Well, shoot.

15:13.100 --> 15:16.433
SUE: The Cat train
and myself were probably
right next to each other.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.367
And he says they're three
to five miles out.

15:18.433 --> 15:20.167
That's exactly where I was.

15:20.433 --> 15:24.100
Visibility's so poor,
we couldn't see
each other, so...

15:26.100 --> 15:28.233
But even at that
distance away,

15:28.300 --> 15:30.867
they may shut her down
and get some rest.

15:31.900 --> 15:33.167
Safety, safety, safety.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.167
They've got their little
travel trailer.

15:35.233 --> 15:36.833
They can handle that.

15:36.900 --> 15:38.400
I'll be here whenever.

15:38.700 --> 15:40.233
It's just hurry up and wait.

15:44.100 --> 15:45.567
CHIP: Anything in life
that you rely on

15:45.633 --> 15:47.433
you have to take
really good care of

15:47.500 --> 15:48.767
or you ain't gonna
have it long.

16:03.067 --> 16:04.200
AGNES: We made it.

16:04.933 --> 16:06.467
CHIP: Yep, we're halfway home.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.633
AGNES: Not bad of a ride.

16:08.700 --> 16:10.300
CHIP: No,
just incredibly slow.

16:12.700 --> 16:14.200
We've been burning
a lot of gas

16:14.267 --> 16:16.667
'cause we're going so slow
and the engine's working
really hard.

16:17.733 --> 16:20.300
But it's staying cool
and it's doing the job,

16:20.700 --> 16:22.067
and what really needs
to happen the most

16:22.133 --> 16:23.633
is that me and Agnes get home.

16:23.700 --> 16:24.967
We need to take our meat home,

16:25.033 --> 16:26.600
and we need to get
her machine home

16:26.667 --> 16:29.233
so that we can fix it
and repair it
and she can rely on it.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.000
We'll get the whole
thing repaired,

16:31.067 --> 16:32.500
and we'll be back on the road.

16:33.567 --> 16:36.000
Well, we're at Gallahan here,
which is a shelter cabin.

16:36.433 --> 16:39.300
And we're halfway
between the Kiwalik
and Noorvik on the Kobuk.

16:39.767 --> 16:42.033
There are places where
you get out of the weather.

16:42.100 --> 16:44.000
The weather here is terrible.
It's the Arctic.

16:44.067 --> 16:45.767
It gets really cold,
so usually you can find

16:45.833 --> 16:48.100
a place to get out of the wind
and get heated up.

16:48.167 --> 16:49.433
If you've got trouble out here

16:49.500 --> 16:51.067
and you can make it
to a shelter cabin,

16:51.133 --> 16:52.767
you pretty much figure
it out after that.

16:54.367 --> 16:55.867
CHIP: At least
we're halfway home.

16:56.633 --> 16:58.767
We just got to cross the inlet
and then get into the river.

16:58.833 --> 17:00.400
Once we're in the river,
we'll be all right.

17:00.467 --> 17:01.933
At least we got rid
of the gas.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.967
Moved the weight.
That's why it's so bad.

17:04.067 --> 17:07.067
Well, I think if we just
carry on and get to
the mouth of the river,

17:07.133 --> 17:10.167
and from the mouth of the
river get up the river and
get home, we'll be done.

17:10.233 --> 17:12.800
We're pretty much past
the rough ice, yeah?

17:12.867 --> 17:14.800
-I don't know, we'll see.
-Hopefully.

17:17.233 --> 17:19.200
-Just get ready and go now?
-Yep.

17:19.267 --> 17:21.300
I'd say we got about
three hours of light left.

17:21.367 --> 17:25.133
So if we start leaving now,
we'll probably get home
just about sundown.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.633
It's nice to step out of
the wind for a little bit.

17:27.700 --> 17:29.300
-AGNES: Yep.
-But we need to carry on.

17:32.233 --> 17:33.467
(CHIP SPEAKING)

18:00.167 --> 18:02.100
AGNES: Chip! Chip! Stop!

18:02.167 --> 18:03.733
My snow machine crashed!

18:15.367 --> 18:18.533
CHIP: Well, it tipped over
on its side as we were
going along.

18:18.667 --> 18:22.567
My wife gave me a couple
good stabs to the kidneys
and I came to a halt.

18:23.567 --> 18:25.433
Looked behind me
and it was laying on its side.

18:25.500 --> 18:27.033
Well, the windshield's cracked
a little bit.

18:27.733 --> 18:28.833
That can be repaired.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.133
It's function not form
that we're after.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.400
Looks like a crack here.

18:32.767 --> 18:35.700
It just tipped.
There was no rider,
you know, stabilising it.

18:36.233 --> 18:38.800
Also, another reason
why we don't leave
another rider on there.

18:39.233 --> 18:41.367
Just got to keep watching.
It's likely to happen again.

18:41.433 --> 18:43.300
This is gonna be a pretty
rough trail until we get out

18:43.367 --> 18:45.700
into the middle of the
Spafarief Bay out here.

18:46.367 --> 18:47.933
Really, that's how it was
when we came in.

18:48.500 --> 18:49.800
-AGNES: Yep.
-So just do me a favour,

18:49.867 --> 18:51.667
-no real good kidney punches.
-I'm sorry about that.

18:51.733 --> 18:52.867
Just a couple love taps

18:52.933 --> 18:53.933
-and we'll be fine.
-Okay.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.000
AGNES: You had to stop.

18:56.067 --> 18:58.667
CHIP: Yes, I had to,
but I felt it too in a way.

18:59.533 --> 19:00.567
I felt it do the jerking.

19:00.633 --> 19:01.633
-AGNES: I know, I...
-It was all wrong.

19:01.700 --> 19:02.700
AGNES: I won't do that.

19:04.800 --> 19:05.967
-CHIP: Ready?
-Yeah.

19:16.267 --> 19:18.400
ANDY:
The more knowledge you have,
the more you can do

19:18.467 --> 19:20.733
and the more you can do,
the better your life is.

19:31.967 --> 19:34.433
Hey, Topey, want to help me
build a shelter?

19:34.833 --> 19:36.767
I had a great day when
I lowered the thing down,

19:36.833 --> 19:38.200
and then the weather
kind of came in

19:38.267 --> 19:40.167
and kicked my butt
a little bit here.

19:40.567 --> 19:42.633
NARRATOR: For Andy,
repairing his wind turbine

19:42.700 --> 19:44.867
is critical to having
power in camp.

19:45.167 --> 19:48.233
But protecting the equipment
from the elements is crucial,

19:48.667 --> 19:50.033
and an onslaught of snow

19:50.100 --> 19:51.933
will force him
to build a shelter
for the labour.

19:52.667 --> 19:56.167
So once again,
adapt to wherever,
whatever's happening.

20:22.700 --> 20:23.967
Hopefully, that'll do it.

20:26.033 --> 20:27.700
They call this "the can."

20:27.767 --> 20:29.967
This is the part that broke.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.433
I think the biggest thing
when you're doing projects
like this

20:32.500 --> 20:36.267
is you just got to really,
really pay attention
when you take it apart,

20:36.667 --> 20:38.000
so that when you put it
back together,

20:38.067 --> 20:40.667
it goes back together
the way you took it apart.

20:42.867 --> 20:46.000
The big thing about
the wind turbine
is just the fact

20:46.700 --> 20:48.433
that my whole premise
of living out here

20:48.500 --> 20:50.633
is I want to be
self-sustaining,

20:51.767 --> 20:54.467
and the wind turbine
allows me to be that way.

20:55.033 --> 20:57.633
If I could spin this
fast enough, I'd be
making power.

21:01.033 --> 21:02.767
Really,
the final step for this

21:04.667 --> 21:06.833
is putting the...
Mounting the blades on.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.100
It feels really solid now.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.267
This is all back together.

21:11.333 --> 21:12.933
It's ready to go up
in the air.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.900
Luckily, I got all the parts
that I needed

21:14.967 --> 21:18.633
and, uh, I feel like
it went pretty good
for the most part.

21:18.700 --> 21:22.533
So pretty much, I'm back to
like-new condition right now,

21:22.600 --> 21:26.300
and I'm hoping I can get
another six or seven years
out of this

21:26.367 --> 21:28.400
before I have to
deal with this again.

21:28.467 --> 21:31.067
I got a few more hours left in
the night before it gets dark.

21:31.133 --> 21:33.733
I think I'm ready to try
and raise the power up.

21:38.333 --> 21:40.167
GLENN:
In order to survive out here
you got to have knowledge.

21:40.233 --> 21:42.000
You got to be able
to take care of yourself,

21:42.067 --> 21:43.067
and if you don't know what
you're doing,

21:43.133 --> 21:44.133
you don't belong out here.

21:54.800 --> 21:56.900
I'm just not sure
there's enough snow here.

21:57.700 --> 21:59.433
The drift might
not be deep enough.

22:00.467 --> 22:02.400
But if I can fit inside of it,
I'll be safe.

22:04.567 --> 22:07.400
If I can get in here,
I can get out of the cold,

22:07.467 --> 22:10.467
get out of the wind,
get out of the elements,

22:10.533 --> 22:12.567
I can survive the night
up on this mountain.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.400
NARRATOR:
To increase his chances
of intercepting caribou

22:15.467 --> 22:17.533
as they migrate through
the Brooks Range,

22:17.600 --> 22:21.867
Glenn is building a snow cave
that will provide shelter
on the ridge for later hunts.

22:21.933 --> 22:24.733
If I get a good cave
built here that I can
get shelter in,

22:24.800 --> 22:26.000
this'll last the rest
of the winter.

22:26.067 --> 22:28.033
I'll be able to come up here
hunting anytime I want.

22:28.267 --> 22:31.633
I'll be able to spend a lot
more time up on this ridge
watching for caribou.

22:32.300 --> 22:34.733
It's gonna get really cold
when the sun goes down.

22:35.567 --> 22:38.267
It can get 40 below
zero out here,

22:38.333 --> 22:41.100
but if I'm under the snow,
this is good insulation.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.567
I just wonder if it could
collapse on me.

22:59.633 --> 23:01.200
That's the only thing
I worry about.

23:04.900 --> 23:07.933
I do not want to end up
in a snow coffin.

23:09.067 --> 23:10.833
It's a little cramped in here.

23:11.267 --> 23:13.467
I do not want
to end up buried.

23:24.067 --> 23:27.633
The ceiling, the walls,
if you touch them, snow falls,

23:27.700 --> 23:31.733
so it's important to be
real careful with movements.

23:35.500 --> 23:39.233
I'm gonna start putting my
stuff in my snow cave now.
I got it all dug out.

23:39.300 --> 23:40.533
It's getting late.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.567
I'm getting extremely tired.

23:42.633 --> 23:45.400
I just want to get in
my sleeping bag now
and try to get some rest.

23:48.233 --> 23:50.867
Wow, got a match lit.
That's the first step.

23:50.933 --> 23:52.633
There's my moose fat lamp.

23:52.700 --> 23:54.200
I think I'm gonna have
a hard time getting it going.

23:56.100 --> 23:59.967
It's so cold, all the moose
fat's frozen really hard.

24:01.200 --> 24:03.333
And all I have
are a few matches here.

24:03.800 --> 24:06.200
See, my matches all,
almost burned out.

24:06.267 --> 24:08.733
I'm gonna have to let go of it
and I didn't get it lit.

24:10.033 --> 24:11.033
Well...

24:13.400 --> 24:14.700
I can try another one.

24:20.100 --> 24:21.100
Come on.

24:22.467 --> 24:23.467
Come on.

24:24.800 --> 24:26.167
Oh, look, it's starting.

24:28.167 --> 24:29.567
There's a little bit of heat.

24:29.833 --> 24:31.767
It's not enough
that it's melting,

24:31.833 --> 24:34.233
it's just enough
to take the chill off.

24:34.767 --> 24:35.867
Feels really good.

24:36.867 --> 24:38.633
I think I could stay here
for a while.

24:39.167 --> 24:42.000
This is really gonna
expand my horizons.

24:42.067 --> 24:43.900
I got a snow cave
on top of a mountain.

24:44.167 --> 24:45.667
I can live anywhere now.

24:45.933 --> 24:48.267
Get up tomorrow, look around,
see what's up here.

24:52.533 --> 24:54.033
CHIP: This is what we call
the first step

24:55.433 --> 24:56.767
of a journey of 1,000 miles.

25:09.300 --> 25:10.833
NARRATOR: After being
stopped in their tracks

25:10.900 --> 25:13.600
while towing their meat
and broken snow machine,

25:13.667 --> 25:15.367
the Hailstones
have secured their cargo

25:15.433 --> 25:18.167
and are back
on the 40-mile trail
to Noorvik.

25:18.233 --> 25:20.300
They must make it home
before darkness falls

25:20.367 --> 25:23.167
and conditions become
too dangerous for travel.

25:27.100 --> 25:29.600
What we're trying to
do today is get home
the sled-load of meat,

25:29.667 --> 25:32.900
my wife's bum ride
and ourselves as well,
all in one go.

25:33.433 --> 25:35.533
You never know really
what it is you're gonna
be seeing out there.

25:35.600 --> 25:38.033
We might have to go along
detours and distances around,

25:38.100 --> 25:39.867
we might have to leave
some things behind.

25:39.933 --> 25:43.900
A breaking down snow machine
isn't nearly as upsetting
as going home

25:43.967 --> 25:45.667
if we didn't have
a sled-load of meat.

25:45.733 --> 25:47.067
A sled-load of meat's
really the prize.

25:47.133 --> 25:48.567
The rest of this
just gets us there.

26:06.133 --> 26:08.333
(AGNES SPEAKING)

26:08.400 --> 26:11.400
-Hey, we made it.
-Hi, girls.

26:11.467 --> 26:13.100
Phew! We started
out early today.

26:13.700 --> 26:14.700
Hi, loves.

26:15.500 --> 26:16.800
AGNES: We made it!

26:16.967 --> 26:19.467
AGNES: You girls look like
girls who are having fun.

26:19.967 --> 26:22.400
Hi, puppy! We brought meat!

26:22.467 --> 26:24.567
CHIP: Yep, we got
a sled-load of meat.
AGNES: Yeah.

26:24.867 --> 26:26.200
This machine's running good.

26:26.267 --> 26:27.933
Your mom's machine
is being junky.

26:28.367 --> 26:29.833
We towed your mom's rig home.

26:30.700 --> 26:33.667
But we got a heart and tongue
from the muskox
for dinner tonight.

26:34.433 --> 26:36.267
Gonna go inside,
warm up and make soup.

26:36.333 --> 26:37.600
-AGNES: Yeah.
-You up for that?

26:38.833 --> 26:40.267
CHIP: Yeah.
AGNES: Yeah.

26:48.700 --> 26:52.467
SUE: I'm just a
mid-50s-year-old fat chick
trying to eke out a living.

26:57.467 --> 26:59.533
Ooh, look at that.

27:00.533 --> 27:02.133
Looks like they are...

27:02.200 --> 27:03.733
Looks like they're
just another mile,

27:03.800 --> 27:05.700
two miles or so,
right up there.

27:06.367 --> 27:08.000
It's been a long time coming
for it to get here.

27:08.467 --> 27:12.033
NARRATOR:
After travelling 86 miles
across the frozen tundra,

27:12.733 --> 27:15.833
Sue's loader has finally
arrived in Kavik.

27:15.900 --> 27:20.167
But getting the heavy machine
off-loaded in unpacked snow
will be challenging.

27:20.700 --> 27:21.967
SUE: So what they're doing now

27:22.033 --> 27:24.067
is he's gonna build
a little snow ramp

27:24.600 --> 27:27.300
so that they can bring
the sleds next to it.

27:32.167 --> 27:34.167
And the plan is
to drive it straight off.

27:35.100 --> 27:36.733
But as it's newly-moved snow,

27:36.800 --> 27:39.333
it's not exactly packed down
super tight.

27:39.400 --> 27:42.767
It's not solid enough,
I don't think, for my loader
to make it off.

27:48.233 --> 27:49.233
I don't want to watch.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
Oh, see, he's stuck.

27:56.700 --> 27:57.967
It's too soft.

27:58.500 --> 28:00.900
You get 53,000 pounds
of loader on,

28:00.967 --> 28:02.033
you're gonna bury it.

28:05.467 --> 28:06.867
They have tracks.

28:06.933 --> 28:09.500
That's solid tyres.

28:09.567 --> 28:12.700
In the world of machinery,
it's a world of difference.

28:13.300 --> 28:14.633
What up, home skillet?

28:15.600 --> 28:16.833
Stuck?

28:16.900 --> 28:18.433
Uh, it's pretty heavy.

28:18.500 --> 28:19.867
-SUE: A little bit.
-Yeah.

28:19.933 --> 28:22.967
SUE: Kind of like me.
A 1960's model
with a lot of ass.

28:23.033 --> 28:24.067
(MAN CHUCKLES)

28:24.933 --> 28:27.167
So, now, he's gonna use
a 90,000-pound winch

28:27.233 --> 28:29.300
to yank the equipment off
and put it in place.

28:31.267 --> 28:32.267
Come on.

28:32.733 --> 28:35.700
Come on, little...
Come on, little kitty cat.

28:36.567 --> 28:37.967
Damn it!

28:38.033 --> 28:39.633
You busted your chain.

28:41.633 --> 28:42.900
Well, see, you know.

28:42.967 --> 28:46.100
They're right around
50,000 pounds, 53,000 pounds.

28:46.533 --> 28:50.800
That winch'll do 90,000,
but you're asking it
on a thin chain.

28:51.300 --> 28:53.700
That's where your...
All of it hits.

28:54.167 --> 28:56.200
So he's gonna use
a beefier chain.

29:12.333 --> 29:14.833
I am grateful that
the loader is here.

29:14.900 --> 29:16.667
But, you know,
it just showed up,

29:16.733 --> 29:19.100
so I need to put it through
some of its paces.

29:20.400 --> 29:22.867
This is not new,
but it's new to me.

29:22.933 --> 29:24.133
I'm excited it's here.

29:24.200 --> 29:26.367
It's going to be,
I think, a great addition.

29:26.600 --> 29:28.367
But there's a huge
learning curve.

29:29.400 --> 29:31.800
This is one of the largest
gambles I've ever done.

29:32.600 --> 29:34.500
And it's either
gonna pay off big,

29:35.600 --> 29:36.800
or cost me a fortune.

29:40.933 --> 29:42.467
This is the next step up.

29:42.533 --> 29:45.833
It's like going
from the trailer park
to the split-level.

29:46.900 --> 29:50.000
It ain't no penthouse, but
it's not the basement either.
(CHUCKLES)

29:50.867 --> 29:52.433
The fact that it's here,

29:52.500 --> 29:55.233
takes me from being
a little boy camp
to a big boy camp.

29:55.300 --> 29:58.367
And now I can get
some things done that
the big companies can do.

29:58.900 --> 30:01.833
You know,
I might have been a gnat
on their backside before,

30:02.533 --> 30:03.967
now I'm a fly in the ointment.

30:09.633 --> 30:11.200
CHIP: Glad to be back home
to girls.

30:11.267 --> 30:13.667
They're what
it's all about for me.
All this is for them.

30:27.700 --> 30:28.800
Oh, that's a pick too.

30:30.800 --> 30:32.833
CHIP: These are the
kind of meals that
you get off an animal,

30:32.900 --> 30:34.600
you know,
when you first catch him

30:34.667 --> 30:36.300
and they're
kind of a delicacy.

30:36.367 --> 30:37.433
There's only one tongue,

30:37.500 --> 30:39.067
there's only one heart
on an animal.

30:39.333 --> 30:41.167
I got a muskox tongue here
and a muskox heart

30:41.233 --> 30:43.433
that I saved up
from a hunt that I just did

30:43.500 --> 30:45.733
and this is the first meal
we're gonna have home
with our kids

30:45.800 --> 30:48.433
and I'm kind of
looking forward to it.

30:48.500 --> 30:50.233
My kids like tongues.

30:50.700 --> 30:52.367
They love muskox.

30:54.833 --> 30:56.367
For us, it's like the
progression of seasons,
you know?

30:56.433 --> 30:58.233
Pretty soon, this
is all gonna change.

30:58.300 --> 31:00.933
It'll all melt down,
the rivers will flow,

31:01.000 --> 31:02.800
we'll be hunting
different animals.

31:02.867 --> 31:05.933
We'll be in different
methods of transportation,
be wearing different shoes.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.100
It's all coming up.

31:07.667 --> 31:09.333
Dinner is ready, gals.

31:09.833 --> 31:11.433
Did someone say dinner?

31:11.500 --> 31:14.033
Yeah, I got an unusual amount
of carrots on my top,

31:14.100 --> 31:15.233
but that's okay.

31:15.600 --> 31:18.600
I think I'm having
an extra big bowl today.

31:18.667 --> 31:19.667
CHIP: Here you go.

31:20.767 --> 31:23.600
You girls got to count
yourselves lucky to have
this heart and tongue

31:23.667 --> 31:26.867
because, man,
I coulda ate it
at any moment.

31:28.800 --> 31:29.800
This is delicious.

31:29.867 --> 31:31.900
This heart is just perfect.

31:32.833 --> 31:34.167
GIRL: The best, been waiting.

31:35.667 --> 31:38.733
AGNES: So after we caught
our sled-load of meat,

31:38.800 --> 31:41.033
then my snow machine
wasn't running good,

31:41.100 --> 31:45.500
we decided to just pack up and
come home and go have muskox
dinner with you girls.

31:46.067 --> 31:47.733
We knew you girls
would be waiting.

31:47.933 --> 31:49.333
GIRL: So glad
you guys came home.

31:50.700 --> 31:53.533
CHIP:
We're gonna fix our rides,
we're gonna gas back up.

31:53.600 --> 31:56.100
We already brought
one load of meat home,

31:56.167 --> 31:57.167
so we'll be pretty confident

31:57.233 --> 31:58.700
leaving you girls
behind this time.

31:58.767 --> 32:00.467
We'll go back for caribou,

32:00.533 --> 32:03.300
see if we see any seals
because it's warming up.
Might come across a bear.

32:03.367 --> 32:04.700
You never know,
the seasons are changing.

32:04.767 --> 32:06.667
Birds'll be back soon,
then we'll be in boats.

32:12.133 --> 32:13.500
That was some
really good ox, right?

32:13.567 --> 32:14.567
It's like the flavour
of the season,

32:14.633 --> 32:15.833
like turkey at Thanksgiving.

32:15.900 --> 32:17.667
-Did you girls like that?
-GIRLS: Yeah.

32:20.533 --> 32:21.767
AGNES: The girls love muskox

32:21.833 --> 32:23.867
and it's a delicacy
for the whole area

32:23.933 --> 32:27.333
'cause we don't usually get
to hunt very many muskox.

32:27.400 --> 32:29.133
It's a permit-hunt only.

32:29.200 --> 32:32.733
So, um, Chip and I
and our girls are lucky
to be able to do this hunt.

32:46.733 --> 32:48.633
So, it's been
a pretty good season.

32:48.700 --> 32:50.567
We accomplished pretty much
everything we wanted to

32:50.633 --> 32:53.900
and thought about this year,
and I'm real thankful that,

32:53.967 --> 32:56.233
you know, we've been
able to travel a lot,

32:56.300 --> 32:58.833
either by foot
and by snow machine,

32:58.900 --> 33:00.200
and checking out
the whole area.

33:00.267 --> 33:01.867
It has lots to offer.

33:02.733 --> 33:05.167
We actually went downriver
towards Emonakrov

33:05.233 --> 33:08.333
and we went and put
a structure down there
for a base camp,

33:08.400 --> 33:11.400
our new properties
we acquired
during the last year,

33:11.467 --> 33:14.667
so we've been improving
and building on that place
down there.

33:16.067 --> 33:17.367
We snared some rabbits.

33:20.033 --> 33:22.800
We went out sheefishing,
so we have holes,

33:22.867 --> 33:24.533
so anytime we feel like
sheefishing,

33:24.600 --> 33:26.633
we go back down there
and go hooking.

33:26.833 --> 33:28.967
And we just had a real
awesome time this year.

33:29.467 --> 33:31.733
I always say,
"Lucky me, my work is play."

33:45.000 --> 33:47.433
ANDY: Every week I screw up
and make mistakes,

33:47.500 --> 33:49.067
but every week
I learn something.

34:00.300 --> 34:04.500
Right now I want to see if
I can't take this anemometer
down from here

34:05.500 --> 34:08.433
and rig up something
on my wind turbine.

34:09.300 --> 34:12.000
This gives me wind speed,

34:12.067 --> 34:13.833
temperature, barometer.

34:13.900 --> 34:15.533
The whole nine yards.

34:15.600 --> 34:17.800
And it transmit wirelessly

34:17.867 --> 34:19.567
down to a receiver
at my house,

34:19.633 --> 34:24.533
so be a pretty cool little
invention to have this on
the wind turbine.

34:38.333 --> 34:41.000
I'm mounting this anemometer
on here is gonna allow me

34:41.067 --> 34:43.667
to gauge the performance
of the wind turbine

34:43.733 --> 34:45.500
and let me know
when it begins to fail,

34:45.567 --> 34:48.500
so I don't have a bad
catastrophic failure again.

34:51.033 --> 34:52.367
In theory.

34:52.433 --> 34:54.600
Everything's always in theory.

34:55.767 --> 34:56.767
All right,

34:56.833 --> 34:58.267
think I'm ready
to go up with it.

34:59.633 --> 35:00.967
Bulldozer time.

35:07.333 --> 35:11.067
It's always challenging when
you do a big project like this
when you're by yourself.

35:11.400 --> 35:14.933
Over the years I've invested
a lot of money in tools
and equipment

35:15.000 --> 35:16.300
so that I can be productive.

35:19.567 --> 35:21.433
And I can be productive
working alone.

35:24.167 --> 35:26.800
Once you get going, I like to
just keep the tension on it,

35:26.867 --> 35:28.167
keep it coming up
nice and steady.

35:28.233 --> 35:29.233
I don't like it jerky.

35:31.867 --> 35:34.300
I can tell it's upright
by the line of slack,

35:34.367 --> 35:37.300
so there's no more
tension with it wanting
to go back over.

35:37.433 --> 35:38.633
So I feel okay right now.

35:38.700 --> 35:41.233
I'm gonna just go up
and start pulling cables off

35:41.300 --> 35:44.300
and start attaching cables
to secure it for the night.

35:50.033 --> 35:51.800
It's always nerve-wracking
when you start

35:51.867 --> 35:55.100
taking the cables off
and transferring 'em.

35:55.167 --> 35:57.467
If a gust of wind comes
when that happens,

35:57.533 --> 35:59.233
there's no support
for your pipe.

35:59.667 --> 36:03.233
Once that tower
gets up in the air
with these blades on it,

36:03.300 --> 36:06.700
it's got a lot of force
and you're really
not guide off very well

36:06.767 --> 36:08.467
until you get everything
tied down.

36:14.100 --> 36:15.200
Holy shit!

36:15.933 --> 36:17.300
Way out of alignment.

36:17.367 --> 36:20.900
This is the part
that is really difficult
to do by yourself.

36:21.067 --> 36:23.333
You've got to pull
the wires tight

36:23.400 --> 36:25.300
and try and get the pole
nice and straight

36:25.367 --> 36:26.967
and it's nice to have
a person here

36:27.100 --> 36:29.433
that you can just say,
"A little tighter,
a little looser."

36:34.800 --> 36:38.333
Just want 'em tight enough
'cause the tower has to be
able to flex too.

36:38.400 --> 36:41.700
The tower can flex
when you're putting
a lot of stress on it.

36:44.533 --> 36:46.633
There's a lot of force
on this tower
when you're running

36:47.700 --> 36:49.167
a 40-knot wind.

36:49.233 --> 36:51.133
Cables almost act
like a spring.

36:52.167 --> 36:54.700
Like anything, if it can flex,
then you have a chance.

36:54.867 --> 36:56.367
But if it can't flex,

36:57.067 --> 36:58.500
it's gonna break somewhere.

37:05.900 --> 37:07.567
Oh, that's actually
looking pretty good.

37:08.133 --> 37:09.667
I got one blade turning
one way

37:09.733 --> 37:11.100
and one turning the other.

37:11.167 --> 37:12.200
Yee-haw.

37:12.267 --> 37:13.833
I'm feeling pretty good
right now.

37:13.900 --> 37:15.733
I'm feeling like I'm up
and running again.

37:16.167 --> 37:18.033
Between the wind
and the solar,

37:18.933 --> 37:21.033
I'm free. I'm living off-grid.

37:21.100 --> 37:22.533
That's what gets me jazzed up.

37:22.600 --> 37:24.000
That's what makes it
all worthwhile.

37:24.067 --> 37:25.467
That's my payoff out here.

37:28.500 --> 37:31.433
Life is, in the bush,
is all about transitions,

37:31.500 --> 37:33.333
from one season to the other,

37:33.467 --> 37:35.700
from one resource
to the other,

37:35.767 --> 37:37.200
from one activity
to the other.

37:37.267 --> 37:38.867
That's what life is out here.

37:38.933 --> 37:41.367
It's this constant circle.

37:41.433 --> 37:43.100
It goes around
from year to year.

37:52.433 --> 37:55.300
I'll remember
this trapping season.

37:56.333 --> 37:57.633
There we go.

37:57.700 --> 37:59.033
I'm liking this day.

37:59.400 --> 38:00.567
Feast to famine.

38:01.033 --> 38:03.700
Oh, yeah! Yeah,
that's a nice-sized
marten too.

38:14.800 --> 38:16.967
It's the same way
with every log

38:17.033 --> 38:18.800
and every board that
I cut around here.

38:18.867 --> 38:22.233
I can still remember the day
that I go and harvested
that tree

38:23.167 --> 38:25.800
and cut that log
and that's why
I live out here.

38:25.867 --> 38:27.000
I love doing that.

38:30.300 --> 38:32.367
I feel really lucky

38:32.433 --> 38:35.200
that I've been able to develop
a homestead here,

38:35.267 --> 38:37.467
create a life
that I have out here

38:38.033 --> 38:40.167
and, um,
live very comfortably.

38:41.133 --> 38:42.500
It's hard work,

38:42.567 --> 38:44.467
but it's only work
if you think it's work.

38:44.700 --> 38:47.600
If a man loves his work,
he never works
a day in his life.

38:49.467 --> 38:50.767
There aren't too many
places in the world

38:50.833 --> 38:52.433
you can brew your own beer,

38:52.500 --> 38:54.700
cut your own logs,
build your own house.

38:55.867 --> 38:57.400
You can here.

38:57.467 --> 38:59.233
Cheers to a good winter,

38:59.300 --> 39:01.067
and looking forward
to a good summer.

39:08.667 --> 39:11.467
GLENN: Being able to stand on
your own, being independent,

39:11.533 --> 39:12.767
being able to take care
of yourself

39:12.833 --> 39:14.333
is a very important part
of this lifestyle.

39:14.400 --> 39:15.400
It's not for everybody.

39:21.333 --> 39:24.533
I'm amazed at how well
this shelter's working out.

39:24.600 --> 39:26.300
I've been keeping
the lamp going a lot.

39:27.133 --> 39:29.433
Course, the big thing
is just to keep hydrated.

39:29.700 --> 39:31.567
I've been drinking
as much as I can drink.

39:32.033 --> 39:33.500
I'd say the temperature's
got to be

39:33.567 --> 39:35.100
right around freezing in here.

39:35.633 --> 39:37.833
This lamp,
it makes all the difference.

39:38.433 --> 39:40.500
I got to get dressed,
go outside, look around,

39:40.567 --> 39:43.300
see what's going on.
In here, I've got no idea.

40:00.733 --> 40:02.900
I'm gonna go up to the top now
and have a look around.

40:02.967 --> 40:04.533
See what's on the other side
of the mountain.

40:14.433 --> 40:15.933
It's a little breezy up here.

40:16.900 --> 40:18.800
A lot different from being
in that snow hole,

40:18.867 --> 40:20.033
all protected from the wind.

40:22.633 --> 40:24.767
From up here, I can see
not only what's going on
at the mountain,

40:24.833 --> 40:28.033
I can see what's going on
down in the valley better
than when I'm at my camp.

40:29.300 --> 40:31.567
Doesn't look like there
are any caribou
on this mountain today,

40:31.633 --> 40:34.067
but oftentimes caribou
do cross this ridge.

40:34.133 --> 40:36.867
And now that I've got a trail
all packed up here,

40:36.933 --> 40:38.633
and I've got a snow cave
right up high,

40:38.700 --> 40:42.100
I can stay in that snow cave
and intercept caribou
on this ridge

40:42.167 --> 40:44.867
more easily than
if I have to travel all
the way from my camp.

40:46.067 --> 40:47.800
It's just been a great fall
and winter

40:47.867 --> 40:49.467
out here in the Brooks Range.

40:49.533 --> 40:52.700
I've had so much going on,
so many experiences.

40:52.767 --> 40:55.367
Just watching the changes,
watching winter set in,

40:55.433 --> 40:57.400
the ice forming
across the lake.

41:02.300 --> 41:04.833
The Northern Lights
coming back again.

41:04.900 --> 41:06.000
Hunting in the fall,

41:06.067 --> 41:07.833
getting my moose
to get through the winter.

41:10.567 --> 41:11.567
Got him.

41:12.500 --> 41:13.767
Building a new camp.

41:15.267 --> 41:17.267
So, I've explored
a lot of different places
on this Earth,

41:17.333 --> 41:22.433
but there's no place for me
that's as intense, as alive,

41:22.500 --> 41:24.600
as beautiful
and as interesting

41:24.667 --> 41:26.367
as this spot right here.

41:26.433 --> 41:27.767
And that's why I'm here.

41:27.833 --> 41:29.600
There's nothing like it.

41:29.667 --> 41:30.667
I love it.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.400
Life just keeps
getting better.

41:37.933 --> 41:40.400
SUE: It's a learning curve.
That's what I like
about it here.

41:40.467 --> 41:42.767
It's always a challenge, it's
always a big learning curve.

41:47.533 --> 41:50.533
I feel every ounce
of my age today,

41:50.600 --> 41:52.167
I tell you that much for free.

41:52.733 --> 41:56.867
You know, I guess
that's part of what I love
about remote Alaska,

41:58.667 --> 42:02.567
is there's a tenacity
and a will to thrive
and survive.

42:03.000 --> 42:07.033
You can get by in life,
or you can live life.

42:08.200 --> 42:09.600
One is just sitting
on your ass

42:09.667 --> 42:11.233
and the other denotes
getting off it.

42:12.267 --> 42:14.633
A few of the highlights for me
of this past winter,

42:14.700 --> 42:17.367
ponying up to the challenge
of the snow machine.

42:17.433 --> 42:19.300
Not letting it getting
the better of me.

42:19.933 --> 42:21.233
(EXHALES) Big day.

42:23.967 --> 42:26.867
This makes it almost one year

42:27.900 --> 42:30.533
since I've gotten on
any kind of snow machine.

42:34.733 --> 42:36.900
It's a learning curve.
That's what I like
about it here.

42:36.967 --> 42:39.600
It's always a challenge,
it's always a big
learning curve.

42:42.833 --> 42:44.100
To me, it's been...

42:45.833 --> 42:48.233
Kind of a unique gig
getting the hunting this year.

42:48.300 --> 42:50.533
Went after the caribou
and got the ptarmigans.

42:58.200 --> 43:00.300
I went after a wolverine,
got the caribou.

43:01.333 --> 43:02.700
(PANTING)

43:03.667 --> 43:07.433
The bigger things that
I've had to invest in
over the winter, the loader.

43:07.500 --> 43:08.933
There's projects
that have to be done

43:09.000 --> 43:11.133
and I have the equipment
to do it now.

43:11.200 --> 43:12.733
So that's what I feel I did
this winter

43:12.800 --> 43:15.200
is got off my booty and got
a bunch of things done.

43:19.433 --> 43:21.067
Successful in the end,

43:21.167 --> 43:23.100
but a hell of a journey
getting there.

43:23.167 --> 43:24.600
(CHUCKLES)
