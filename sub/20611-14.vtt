[dramatic music]

00:04.372 --> 00:10.544
*

00:10.578 --> 00:13.481
- My name is Chad Boseman.
I'm 45 years old.

00:13.514 --> 00:16.617
I am a very competitive person.
I almost have to win.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.752
It's something that's just
kind of ingrained in my head,

00:18.786 --> 00:20.621
and I definitely
don't go into things

00:20.654 --> 00:23.057
if I know I'm gonna lose.

00:23.091 --> 00:25.126
- My name's Rachel Oliver.
I'm 33 years old,

00:25.159 --> 00:26.694
and I'm from Southeast Michigan.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.362
My knives,
I make them to be rough,

00:28.396 --> 00:31.099
tough, beautiful,
eccentric, unique.

00:31.132 --> 00:32.633
Just like me.

00:32.666 --> 00:34.602
- I'm Buster Grubbs.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.504
I'm 61 years old,

00:36.537 --> 00:38.306
and I'm from Macon, Georgia.

00:38.339 --> 00:40.808
One of my favorite quotes
is from Mother Goose

00:40.841 --> 00:43.244
is "Good, better, best.
Never rest,

00:43.277 --> 00:45.513
until good be better,
and better be best."

00:45.546 --> 00:47.548
And I try to live by that quote.

00:47.581 --> 00:50.251
- My name's Shawn Ellis.
I'm 56 years old.

00:50.284 --> 00:52.620
I'm real stubborn.
If I lost a leg out here,

00:52.653 --> 00:54.522
I'd still be up there
trying to forge a knife.

00:54.555 --> 00:58.159
That's just the way I am,
'cause I come here to win.

00:58.192 --> 01:00.861
- Bladesmiths,
welcome to the Forge.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.563
You're here to engage
in three rounds

01:02.596 --> 01:04.332
of edged
weapon-making competition

01:04.365 --> 01:05.799
specifically designed to test

01:05.833 --> 01:08.402
every aspect
of your capabilities.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.871
All in front of our panel
of expert judges

01:10.904 --> 01:13.674
who will determine which of you
is the "Forged in Fire" champion

01:13.707 --> 01:17.345
and also leaves here
with that check for 10 grand,

01:17.378 --> 01:19.113
so what do you say
we meet them now?

01:19.147 --> 01:21.582
ABS master smith
J. Nielson.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.251
Next, historic weapons

01:23.284 --> 01:25.519
recreation specialist
David Baker.

01:25.553 --> 01:27.688
And last, kali martial artist

01:27.721 --> 01:31.725
and edged weapon specialist
Doug Marcaida.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.894
I'm sure that you noticed,
on your anvil in front of you,

01:33.927 --> 01:36.464
you have a high-quality
billet of steel.

01:36.497 --> 01:39.533
You'll be using that today,
but there's a twist.

01:39.567 --> 01:43.204
Today, I'm feeling
a little bit...

01:43.237 --> 01:45.406
nautical.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.275
*

01:47.308 --> 01:49.877
- It's like--
I think it's boat chain.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.680
I've never used it
in my entire life.

01:52.713 --> 01:55.749
I am completely
at a loss for words.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.518
- While forging
your signature blade

01:57.551 --> 01:59.287
in your signature style today,

01:59.320 --> 02:01.289
you will also have
to incorporate an element

02:01.322 --> 02:02.656
from this sea anchor or chain

02:02.690 --> 02:04.358
into your blade's construction

02:04.392 --> 02:06.794
using a san mai
or inlay technique

02:08.196 --> 02:10.331
and the blade parameters
are as follows.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.633
The length of your blade,
not including the tang,

02:12.666 --> 02:15.336
must be between
14 and 16 inches.

02:15.369 --> 02:16.637
The overall length
of your weapon

02:16.670 --> 02:19.307
must not exceed 22 inches.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.774
Keep in mind that
in the second round

02:20.808 --> 02:22.376
you'll be putting handles
on your blades

02:22.410 --> 02:24.378
to turn them into
fully functional weapons

02:24.412 --> 02:27.181
that will then be tested
for strength and durability

02:27.215 --> 02:29.617
in a wooden crate chop

02:29.650 --> 02:32.686
and for edge retention
in a fish slice.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.955
You will have ten minutes
to work on your designs.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.757
You will have three hours
to forge your blades.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.559
When that time runs out,

02:38.592 --> 02:40.294
and the judges have
inspected your work,

02:40.328 --> 02:42.596
one of you will have
to surrender your blade

02:42.630 --> 02:44.765
and leave the Forge.

02:44.798 --> 02:46.567
Good luck, bladesmiths.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.203
Your ten minute design
window starts now.

02:49.237 --> 02:51.839
[rock music]

02:51.872 --> 02:54.375
Some of that stuff looks like
it's been sitting at the bottom

02:54.408 --> 02:55.876
of the ocean with the Titanic.

02:55.909 --> 02:57.945
Is that useable steel?

02:57.978 --> 03:00.681
- It's useable steel,
but it's not hardenable steel,

03:00.714 --> 03:02.816
so they're gonna have
to sandwich it up with that W2.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.686
*

03:05.719 --> 03:08.389
- I'm going to use the chain.
It's the right size,

03:08.422 --> 03:09.623
and I think I can work with it.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.559
And I'm designing a bowie knife,

03:11.592 --> 03:12.893
'cause it's always
superior cutter.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.295
It's my favorite.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.797
14 1/2.

03:16.830 --> 03:19.600
I build knives
to be durable, functional.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.935
A high-performance blade
is where it's at.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.771
*

03:23.804 --> 03:25.406
- I'm gonna use
the little anchor chain,

03:25.439 --> 03:26.974
because the anchors--

03:27.007 --> 03:29.543
I don't know
what they're made out of.

03:29.577 --> 03:32.813
I'm just gonna go with a plain
bowie-style butcher knife.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.948
It's a simple knife to make.

03:34.982 --> 03:38.452
I feel really good about this,
because I'm good at adapting.

03:38.486 --> 03:40.521
You name it.
Any kind of old craft

03:40.554 --> 03:43.391
I just about know how to do it.
I've studied up on it.

03:43.424 --> 03:45.025
I've been reading up
on moonshining lately.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.328
[laughter]

03:47.361 --> 03:48.896
- I love the fact that
we're doing blades that long.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.598
I mean those are
just so much fun.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.966
I mean, it's almost like
a short sword.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.035
- Ideas start flowing,
and I'm starting to think,

03:55.068 --> 03:57.338
"Okay.
Chain."

03:57.371 --> 03:58.672
Chain's something I can cut
straight pieces out of.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.674
I can put a handle on it.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.676
As I'm designing the blade,
I am thinking

04:02.710 --> 04:04.645
I'm gonna go with something
I love to make

04:04.678 --> 04:06.480
which is somewhere
between a seax

04:06.514 --> 04:08.048
and a sheep's foot.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.851
This is my chance
to take an absolute surprise

04:10.884 --> 04:13.454
and turn it into something
completely functional.

04:13.487 --> 04:16.390
Maybe even beautiful,
if I do a good enough job.

04:16.424 --> 04:17.958
- I have no idea
what I'm gonna do with this.

04:17.991 --> 04:21.061
Those are just not good metals
to work with,

04:21.094 --> 04:23.297
so I'm not gonna get fancy.

04:23.331 --> 04:26.367
I'm gonna make a good,
solid Viking seax knife.

04:26.400 --> 04:30.538
It's a chopper,
and they also are very sharp,

04:30.571 --> 04:32.606
so that it'll slice
through the fish.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.042
I think I will accomplish
what I need to accomplish.

04:35.075 --> 04:38.078
- Bladesmiths,
the design period is now closed.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.947
Grab your steel,

04:39.980 --> 04:41.014
because your three-hour
forge time starts now.

04:41.048 --> 04:45.753
*

04:45.786 --> 04:48.856
- First thing I'd grab,
those smaller links.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.658
- The chain's so heavy.

04:50.691 --> 04:52.726
Really all of us
has got to work together,

04:52.760 --> 04:54.728
because we've got to break
at least one link

04:54.762 --> 04:57.465
before anybody
can have their own.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.500
- [bleep] it--it's stuck.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.735
- Uh-oh.
That's some tough stuff.

05:01.769 --> 05:04.638
It's very low carbon content,
but it's very durable.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.540
- Right here.

05:06.574 --> 05:10.444
I want a big old ass chunk
out of it.

05:10.478 --> 05:12.045
There it is.
There's one.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.481
Now, who wants that right there?

05:13.514 --> 05:15.549
- Once that chain is cut,

05:15.583 --> 05:17.985
the best idea is
to cut straight sections.

05:18.018 --> 05:21.088
Lose the curves.

05:21.121 --> 05:23.891
- Now, why did Buster
just cut that little section?

05:23.924 --> 05:25.659
I bet he's gonna try and stretch
that whole link out.

05:25.693 --> 05:28.529
- Doesn't make much sense to me.

05:28.562 --> 05:30.731
*

05:30.764 --> 05:33.133
- I work with junk iron
all the time in my shop,

05:33.166 --> 05:37.371
so nothing's the right shape
when I start with it.

05:37.405 --> 05:39.507
- Buster did exactly what I
didn't want to see somebody do.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.442
He's gonna try and unfold it,

05:41.475 --> 05:43.076
and he does not need
that much wrought iron.

05:43.110 --> 05:45.946
- I ought to cut it off.
I got enough without it.

05:45.979 --> 05:48.081
- Put it on the damn chop saw,
and cut that son of a bitch off.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.017
It's what I'd do.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.585
You're gonna--it's gonna
take too damn long.

05:51.619 --> 05:55.923
*

05:55.956 --> 05:58.158
- My plan is
to take the wrought iron,

05:58.191 --> 06:00.528
flatten it out,
get two flat pieces,

06:00.561 --> 06:02.796
and then sandwich it
on both sides of the W2.

06:02.830 --> 06:05.433
I'm gonna get both of my pieces
in the fire at the same time,

06:05.466 --> 06:07.701
and so when I get one cold,

06:07.735 --> 06:09.670
I can swap it out
with the other one and work it,

06:09.703 --> 06:11.872
until I combine 'em.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.607
I'm just trying
to turn that crap

06:13.641 --> 06:15.509
into something
that looks like a knife.

06:15.543 --> 06:17.945
[laughs]

06:17.978 --> 06:20.781
*

06:20.814 --> 06:23.050
- Son of a bitch ain't
getting hot, man.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.085
The piece of W2 is,
like, 10 inches long,

06:25.118 --> 06:27.187
and I want
to get the wrought iron,

06:27.220 --> 06:29.990
draw it out at least
to that length and that width,

06:30.023 --> 06:33.160
and sandwich,
and forge weld 'em all together.

06:33.193 --> 06:36.797
- Here we go.
Shawn is on the press.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.499
- Shawn got that up
to temperature real quick.

06:38.532 --> 06:41.469
- He did.
- That [bleep] son of a bitch.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.671
[bleep] hot enough.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.473
- Well, maybe not quite.

06:45.506 --> 06:46.607
- If you don't get
it hot enough,

06:46.640 --> 06:48.576
it will split out on you.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.010
The wrought iron I just use
for guards and stuff.

06:50.043 --> 06:52.513
I never tried to use it
in forge welding.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.715
*

06:54.748 --> 06:56.850
- My biggest concern
coming into this challenge

06:56.884 --> 06:58.919
is getting a solid forge weld
from wrought iron

06:58.952 --> 07:00.220
to this high-carbon steel.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.089
I have read about san mai.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.625
I have seen it done.

07:04.658 --> 07:07.828
I have never personally
attempted it myself.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.464
Oh, God.
This is intense.

07:10.498 --> 07:12.065
Definitely I'm doing,
like, a switcheroo.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.901
Back and forth.
Trading off left and right.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.669
I'm going
between the wrought iron

07:15.703 --> 07:16.970
and my high-carbon steel.

07:17.004 --> 07:19.039
Back and forth constantly.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.908
Today's my first time
ever using a power hammer.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.911
It is so cool.
It's so efficient, so fast.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.013
It makes everything about this

07:26.046 --> 07:28.549
a dream come true.

07:28.582 --> 07:31.084
- I think Rachel is very excited
by Big Blue,

07:31.118 --> 07:33.020
and maybe a little--

07:33.053 --> 07:34.755
- Enamored with the toy.
- Overusing it.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.524
Maybe just a little bit.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.091
- As I'm drawing out
my chain link,

07:38.125 --> 07:39.927
running it through
the power hammer,

07:39.960 --> 07:41.529
even though I'm running it
on a light pressure,

07:41.562 --> 07:43.030
it's causing it
to stress fracture

07:43.063 --> 07:44.665
all throughout the entire piece.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.033
That piece of wrought iron
was scrap.

07:46.066 --> 07:48.001
It was no good.

07:48.035 --> 07:49.136
I got to start over.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.771
- Do you?
- Yeah.

07:50.804 --> 07:51.939
- I think she's gonna
stretch out

07:51.972 --> 07:53.807
another piece of wrought iron.

07:53.841 --> 07:56.043
- Oh, I thought she was further
ahead than that.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.979
- Now we're cooking with gas.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.582
My plan is to do an inlay

08:01.615 --> 08:04.652
with the high-carbon steel
and the chain link.

08:04.685 --> 08:08.221
I don't really know how
the anchor chain is gonna react,

08:08.255 --> 08:10.958
because this particular
type of metal

08:10.991 --> 08:13.226
is not something that
I have worked with before.

08:13.260 --> 08:16.797
So you know, the old saying,
"Keep it simple, stupid?"

08:16.830 --> 08:20.167
Well, that's me.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.971
- Well, I like the fact
that Chad is drawing out that W2

08:24.004 --> 08:27.975
and not just
welding big slabs together.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.578
- I have to sit down
from time to time,

08:30.611 --> 08:32.079
because of the pain in my back.

08:32.112 --> 08:34.081
I have three ruptured discs,

08:34.114 --> 08:36.216
and it gets to the point
that I just can't do anything.

08:36.249 --> 08:37.851
- Chad!

08:37.885 --> 08:39.152
Don't drink that water.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.855
[laughter]

08:41.889 --> 08:44.858
*

08:44.892 --> 08:47.561
- Okay, let's measure
this son of a bitch now.

08:47.595 --> 08:49.229
Damn it.

08:49.262 --> 08:50.864
I realize that
I can't get the wrought iron

08:50.898 --> 08:53.266
the perfect size as the W2.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.002
I'm running out of time.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.204
So I decide to cut 'em short.

08:57.237 --> 09:01.809
*

09:01.842 --> 09:04.712
- I think we have
our first stack.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.580
- I'm a little nervous

09:06.614 --> 09:09.216
welding the W2
and the wrought iron together.

09:09.249 --> 09:11.284
This is something
I've never done.

09:11.318 --> 09:13.053
Might not be
the damn purtiest thing,

09:13.086 --> 09:15.022
but maybe it'll work.

09:15.055 --> 09:18.892
- Now, Shawn, he's setting
himself up beautifully.

09:18.926 --> 09:21.294
When it comes to forge welding,
I think experience

09:21.328 --> 09:23.697
is really the telling thing.
It's a recipe.

09:23.731 --> 09:27.267
How you set yourself up
for that initial weld

09:27.300 --> 09:29.102
is gonna set the pace
for everything else you do.

09:29.136 --> 09:30.904
- Wrought iron--it's just weird.

09:30.938 --> 09:33.206
You know,
I've never forged wrought iron

09:33.240 --> 09:35.208
with a blade on a san mai,

09:35.242 --> 09:37.277
but I will figure it out,
'fore it's all said and done.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.680
I know I have to get
this forge weld right.

09:39.713 --> 09:42.115
Otherwise it's just gonna
cause failure down the road.

09:42.149 --> 09:45.285
- Bladesmiths!
One hour has elapsed!

09:45.318 --> 09:47.788
You have only
two hours remaining!

09:47.821 --> 09:50.891
*

09:50.924 --> 09:52.225
- When I get
the wrought iron straight,

09:52.259 --> 09:54.194
I cut both pieces,

09:54.227 --> 09:55.929
and then sandwich it
on both sides of the W2,

09:55.963 --> 09:57.865
and go for a forge weld,

09:57.898 --> 10:01.001
and hope for the best.
There goes nothing.

10:01.034 --> 10:03.070
- All right,
so Buster setting his welds.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.272
- Yay.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.808
- Buster is just cooking that
metal like you wouldn't believe.

10:07.841 --> 10:10.310
*

10:10.343 --> 10:13.046
- I got on the power hammer.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.414
It's not going real good.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.684
Made a couple of mis-clicks

10:16.717 --> 10:19.720
and got my blade too thin
right in the center,

10:19.753 --> 10:23.256
and I'm seeing inclusions
and bad places in my blade.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.925
I'm getting a little bit
of delamination too.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.226
- I know.
It's hard, man.

10:26.259 --> 10:28.261
- Maybe didn't get it
hot enough.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.764
So I'm just trying
to grind off what I can.

10:30.798 --> 10:32.365
It's not working.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.702
I'm not feeling
good at all about it.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.737
*

10:36.770 --> 10:38.371
- My wrought iron
and my high-carbon steel--

10:38.405 --> 10:41.441
they've been drawn out
to a sufficient length,

10:41.474 --> 10:44.444
and now it's time to start
welding my billet together.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.046
- So Rachel is over here.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.815
She's been at the welder
for a while.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.884
Hopefully everything
comes together real nice.

10:50.918 --> 10:54.121
- San mai is a technique
I really know very little about,

10:54.154 --> 10:57.024
and I really cannot wait
to give this a shot.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.792
My biggest concern at this point

10:58.826 --> 11:00.794
is that the welds
are not gonna stick.

11:00.828 --> 11:02.362
When it comes down
to forge welding you never know.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.264
You never know
until you're done.

11:04.297 --> 11:08.335
*

11:08.368 --> 11:12.272
- I start by taking the chain
and putting it in the press.

11:12.305 --> 11:15.876
I'm trying to mash it down
into billet size.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.778
*

11:17.811 --> 11:21.114
- I'm not feeling too good
about what Chad's up to.

11:21.148 --> 11:23.717
- God blast it.
Fell apart.

11:23.751 --> 11:25.352
The ends begin to split,

11:25.385 --> 11:29.189
and so I have to step back
and try again.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.258
Blast it.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.193
Whew.
I need to cool off.

11:33.226 --> 11:37.130
- He's looking pale.
He's looking really white.

11:37.164 --> 11:40.167
- There's four forges
going all at the same time.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.269
Upwards of 2,400 degrees each.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.905
That's a lot of heat.

11:44.938 --> 11:47.875
- At this point,
things stop making sense for me.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.309
[dramatic music]

11:49.342 --> 11:52.913
- Uh...

11:52.946 --> 11:54.247
I just can't even concentrate?

11:56.449 --> 11:58.218
- I-I don't know.

11:58.251 --> 12:01.154
And I know that something
is going on.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.097
- How you doing, brother?
- [sighs]

12:10.130 --> 12:11.832
- I think we should
call an ambulance.

12:11.865 --> 12:15.302
*

12:15.335 --> 12:18.205
The medic tells me my pulse
is up in the 120s,

12:18.238 --> 12:19.907
and my blood pressure
was through the roof.

12:19.940 --> 12:22.542
I am just exhibiting all
the signs of heat exhaustion.

12:22.575 --> 12:25.045
- You all right?
- Whew.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.880
- Part of planning for the win

12:26.914 --> 12:29.016
is taking into consideration
the environment.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.884
It's never your friend.

12:30.918 --> 12:31.919
I am concerned right now.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.090
- No, sir.
I do not believe so.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.059
I am...

12:39.092 --> 12:41.361
I am upset

12:41.394 --> 12:44.164
that I can't showcase
what I know how to do.

12:44.197 --> 12:46.199
This beast got me.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.235
*

12:48.268 --> 12:50.270
- Chad is out,

12:50.303 --> 12:52.205
but that doesn't mean
these other smiths are safe.

12:52.239 --> 12:53.974
All of our remaining smiths

12:54.007 --> 12:57.044
are still required
to complete their blades

12:57.077 --> 13:02.115
within those parameters
to continue to the next round.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.516
*

13:06.419 --> 13:08.321
I seen the cold shut
on my blade,

13:08.355 --> 13:09.589
and I just went, "Oh, my gosh.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.158
This blade's ruined."

13:11.191 --> 13:13.126
C'mon, bitch.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.828
Sometimes you can save 'em.
Sometimes you can't.

13:14.862 --> 13:16.329
*

13:16.363 --> 13:18.131
I hope I can pull this off,

13:18.165 --> 13:19.833
but then I said,
"No, you're gonna pull it off."

13:19.867 --> 13:21.534
I'm gonna go get that chisel,

13:21.568 --> 13:23.871
and I said,
"I'll fix this real quick."

13:23.904 --> 13:27.407
- I'm enjoying watching Shawn
work over here.

13:27.440 --> 13:30.310
He's been very deliberate
the whole time.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.612
Not a lot of wasted energy.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.581
- You know what the task
at hand is.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.183
You just got to forge ahead.

13:38.551 --> 13:42.055
- Shawn's heating up
his blade for a quench.

13:42.089 --> 13:43.924
I don't know if the other two
are quenching or not.

13:43.957 --> 13:46.426
*

13:46.459 --> 13:49.129
- Shazam!
That's how you do it, boys.

13:49.162 --> 13:52.465
I quench my blade,
but then I pull my blade out

13:52.499 --> 13:55.235
and I could see it had
just a slight warp,

13:55.268 --> 13:58.171
but with time ticking down,
I feel like I brought my A-game,

13:58.205 --> 13:59.907
and probably the best
that I could do.

13:59.940 --> 14:04.644
*

14:04.677 --> 14:07.347
- What have we seen
when your blades are so skinny

14:07.380 --> 14:09.149
when you quench?

14:09.182 --> 14:11.618
both: Woop.

14:11.651 --> 14:14.087
- I'm noticing that
I'm getting bends in my blade,

14:14.121 --> 14:16.123
so I'm just trying
to straighten it out here

14:16.156 --> 14:18.892
in the normalizing process
which is not a real good idea.

14:18.926 --> 14:20.427
*

14:20.460 --> 14:22.029
- Don't hit that anymore.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.997
Please don't hit
that blade anymore.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.298
- Come out the second time on
the normalize,

14:25.332 --> 14:27.067
it's crooked again.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.302
I have to straighten it,
but that's all I got.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.972
I done run out of time.
I'm out, man.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.640
I beat my blade too thin
right in the middle.

14:33.673 --> 14:36.209
Couldn't get it back.
- Sorry about that.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.979
*

14:39.012 --> 14:40.313
- Quench, quench.

14:40.347 --> 14:42.315
*

14:42.349 --> 14:44.151
- Come on, let's just--
trying to use the Force

14:44.184 --> 14:45.685
to get him to quench his--
- Yeah.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.220
Maybe if you do it
all at the same time.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.990
- [laughs]

14:50.023 --> 14:52.492
*

14:52.525 --> 14:55.395
- Hey, it's now or never.
I got to dip this thing.

14:55.428 --> 15:00.033
*

15:00.067 --> 15:01.935
- Big flameout.
There you go.

15:01.969 --> 15:04.471
That's a good way to lose
some beard hair there.

15:04.504 --> 15:07.340
*

15:07.374 --> 15:09.276
- Do you see that?
It looks fairly straight.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.344
- It does.

15:11.378 --> 15:13.313
- So what's Rachel got going?

15:13.346 --> 15:15.682
- Rachel's got a long, thin bar.

15:15.715 --> 15:19.152
- Rachel's one foot on the box,
one foot on the floor,

15:19.186 --> 15:20.687
leaning into that thing.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.655
- Look at her go, man.

15:22.689 --> 15:25.525
- I start pushing just
a little bit too hard.

15:25.558 --> 15:28.628
- Whoa!
- [bleep]

15:28.661 --> 15:30.163
I'm like, "Oh, my God."
[laughs]

15:30.197 --> 15:33.166
It made me jump.
It definitely did.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.336
I don't know how to put it on.
How do you adjust it?

15:36.369 --> 15:38.705
- I was about to say it looks
like Rachel is twisting

15:38.738 --> 15:40.373
a freaking pipe wrench

15:40.407 --> 15:41.641
over there
against that grinder,

15:41.674 --> 15:44.477
and she just threw the belt.

15:44.511 --> 15:46.279
- When I finally get
the belt sander figured out

15:46.313 --> 15:48.681
I am grinding away
and I realize

15:48.715 --> 15:52.185
my blade is
a little too long and thin...

15:52.219 --> 15:54.487
No!

15:54.521 --> 15:56.156
But time is flying by.

15:56.189 --> 15:57.590
It's time to get
my blade quenched.

15:57.624 --> 16:01.194
- Ten, nine, eight,

16:01.228 --> 16:04.197
seven, six, five,

16:04.231 --> 16:06.399
four, three,

16:06.433 --> 16:08.368
two, one.

16:08.401 --> 16:11.704
Bladesmiths, this round is over!

16:11.738 --> 16:14.341
- Wil called the time,
and I feel real excited.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.476
Feel like I done real well.

16:16.509 --> 16:19.312
This blade reminds me of
just a big hard-working knife.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.248
A big hard-working knife.
[chuckles]

16:21.281 --> 16:22.715
- Now that my blade is finished,

16:22.749 --> 16:25.118
I'm worried that
it's got a big warp in it,

16:25.152 --> 16:27.654
and I feel I might have just
overshot the length by a hair.

16:27.687 --> 16:30.523
Right now it's not
looking so good.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.592
*

16:32.625 --> 16:35.162
- I'm sure you've noticed
we're one bladesmith short.

16:35.195 --> 16:37.197
Chad, due to medical reasons,

16:37.230 --> 16:39.266
has opted out
of this competition.

16:39.299 --> 16:40.767
Rest assured he'll be fine.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.203
However, that does not mean

16:43.236 --> 16:45.638
that any of you are safe
from elimination.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.607
You still must fulfill
the blade parameters

16:47.640 --> 16:50.110
that were set forth
from round one.

16:50.143 --> 16:52.145
So let's jump right into it.

16:52.179 --> 16:54.181
Shawn, you're up first.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.649
*

16:56.683 --> 16:59.419
- I got to say, Shawn,
there's not a lot of times

16:59.452 --> 17:00.687
in this competition

17:00.720 --> 17:03.456
where I see a competitor do

17:03.490 --> 17:06.326
exactly what I would have done.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.561
As far as prepping your steel,

17:08.595 --> 17:10.597
putting it together--

17:10.630 --> 17:13.533
you got a little bit
of a wiggle in here,

17:13.566 --> 17:16.069
but I don't see
any serious delams.

17:16.103 --> 17:18.205
You got one little spot
right here.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.340
- Well, Shawn,
san mai construction--

17:20.373 --> 17:23.176
not many people can pull it off.
You did a very good job.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.745
It's a solid piece.
- Yes, sir.

17:25.778 --> 17:28.348
*

17:28.381 --> 17:31.484
- Wil, the parameters were?
- 14 to 16 inches.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.153
*

17:33.186 --> 17:36.789
- 15 inches, so good job.

17:36.823 --> 17:40.360
- Buster, you're up next.

17:40.393 --> 17:43.463
- Buster, my real concern
is right here.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.432
You got a very thin section,

17:45.465 --> 17:47.867
and that is right
in the sweet spot

17:47.900 --> 17:50.837
where I'll be striking,
but I like the shape of it.

17:50.870 --> 17:53.340
I like the feel of it.

17:53.373 --> 17:57.277
- Well, you virtually forged it
to shape which is great.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.546
Far as the length goes...

17:59.579 --> 18:01.448
*

18:01.481 --> 18:03.483
About 14 3/4,

18:03.516 --> 18:05.152
so you're right there
in the parameters.

18:05.185 --> 18:08.788
- Rachel, you're up next.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.790
- Well, Rachel,
my concern was that

18:10.823 --> 18:14.661
you drew that steel out
very long and very fine,

18:14.694 --> 18:18.131
and also you've got
quite a warp here.

18:18.165 --> 18:19.666
- Okay.
Most of that warp, luckily,

18:19.699 --> 18:21.834
is back here at your tang,

18:21.868 --> 18:28.341
so that hopefully won't be
a hard thing to correct.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.577
Look at that.

18:30.610 --> 18:35.282
*

18:35.315 --> 18:37.317
[quietly]
Right there.

18:39.186 --> 18:42.522
You are 1/16th of an inch

18:42.555 --> 18:45.792
shy of 16 inches.
[chuckles]

18:45.825 --> 18:47.527
All right.
Good job.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.429
- Thank you.
- Bladesmiths,

18:49.462 --> 18:51.464
because all of your blades
fit the parameters

18:51.498 --> 18:53.800
and Chad has opted out
of this competition,

18:53.833 --> 18:56.269
there is no need
for a deliberation.

18:56.303 --> 18:58.271
We are just gonna jump
right into round two

18:58.305 --> 19:01.641
which means that you're
one step closer to $10,000

19:01.674 --> 19:03.710
and the title of
"Forged in Fire" champion.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.645
- Thank God.
[laughs]

19:05.678 --> 19:07.647
I am absolutely stoked
to put a handle on this,

19:07.680 --> 19:09.482
but I'm thinking,

19:09.516 --> 19:11.384
"Well, this isn't just
a handle challenge.

19:11.418 --> 19:12.585
There's gonna be something
thrown into the mix."

19:12.619 --> 19:14.454
- In this round of competition,

19:14.487 --> 19:15.888
you'll be attaching handles
to your blades,

19:15.922 --> 19:17.690
to turn them into
fully functional weapons

19:17.724 --> 19:19.692
that will be tested
for strength and durability

19:19.726 --> 19:21.461
in a wooden crate chop

19:21.494 --> 19:24.197
and sharpness in a fish slice.

19:24.231 --> 19:25.832
You have full use of the pantry

19:25.865 --> 19:27.867
and three hours
to assemble your handle.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.470
When the time runs out
and your blades have been tested

19:30.503 --> 19:32.772
one of you will have
to surrender your weapon

19:32.805 --> 19:35.342
and leave the Forge.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.843
Oh, wait.

19:36.876 --> 19:39.212
There's one more thing.

19:39.246 --> 19:41.748
Keeping with our nautical theme

19:41.781 --> 19:44.484
*

19:44.517 --> 19:46.586
you must also include an element

19:46.619 --> 19:49.789
from that bronze propeller
into your handle's design.

19:49.822 --> 19:51.758
- What am I gonna do
with that, you know?

19:51.791 --> 19:54.594
Can I use it for a pin,
or can I do liners with it?

19:54.627 --> 19:55.828
- Good luck, bladesmiths.

19:55.862 --> 19:59.466
Your three hours starts now.

19:59.499 --> 20:02.535
[rock music]

20:02.569 --> 20:04.837
- What I need to do in this
round is pull off some magic.

20:08.641 --> 20:11.478
I need to address the thin place

20:11.511 --> 20:12.912
in the middle of the blade,

20:12.945 --> 20:15.382
and I had a little place
back in my handle

20:15.415 --> 20:17.684
where my handle
and the blade came together.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.919
I need to address
that some way or another.

20:19.952 --> 20:22.389
- There's a lot of cleaning up
to do,

20:22.422 --> 20:24.791
but that's going to reveal
a lot of issues

20:24.824 --> 20:27.026
and lighten his blade
even more.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.028
- He's got two seriously
thin spots,

20:29.061 --> 20:32.332
and both of 'em are in about
the worst places possible.

20:32.365 --> 20:34.301
- If I go any deeper,

20:34.334 --> 20:36.936
I'm gonna grind out
the integrity of the blade.

20:36.969 --> 20:39.839
*

20:39.872 --> 20:41.708
- Ugh.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.042
The first thing
I'm gonna have to do

20:43.075 --> 20:44.977
is lighten up that blade

20:45.011 --> 20:46.879
and straighten out
that handle a little bit.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.981
A blade of that size--

20:49.015 --> 20:51.618
it's gonna have to have
some very strong handles.

20:51.651 --> 20:55.288
I pick out some canvas Micarta
because it's very durable.

20:55.322 --> 20:57.624
It don't shrink.
It don't swell.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.926
It's just tough.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.561
I'm excited,
but you know,

21:01.594 --> 21:04.564
anything could
happen in this round.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.733
*

21:06.766 --> 21:08.535
- Heading into round two
I have a laundry list of things

21:08.568 --> 21:10.570
I need to take care of.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.772
Because I have so much
to grind this time,

21:12.805 --> 21:14.641
I'm gonna make the first hour
dedicated to the grinding.

21:14.674 --> 21:17.009
Getting this blade in shape.

21:17.043 --> 21:19.479
I have a warp in my handle.
Thin to the ricasso.

21:19.512 --> 21:20.947
There's no turning back
from that.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.949
Just gonna have to go
with what I got.

21:22.982 --> 21:25.418
- Nobody even wants to look
at that propeller right now.

21:25.452 --> 21:27.387
All smiths are ignoring the fact

21:27.420 --> 21:29.021
that that's even sitting
in the middle of the room.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.757
- I don't care
about that propeller.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.625
I don't care about
anything else going on.

21:32.659 --> 21:34.661
It's just me, the grinder,
and getting that set up.

21:34.694 --> 21:36.796
*

21:36.829 --> 21:38.998
- Well, I was thinking
I could use the propeller

21:39.031 --> 21:41.000
to cover up the flaw
on the bolster.

21:41.033 --> 21:43.536
- Buster might just
propel himself

21:43.570 --> 21:46.606
right out of the finals.

21:46.639 --> 21:50.109
- I get it now.
- Propel, ha ha.

21:50.142 --> 21:53.380
Well, regardless of who's
propelled into the next round

21:53.413 --> 21:56.616
it's kind of
a sink-or-swim moment.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.551
- I'm a little nervous
about using this

21:58.585 --> 21:59.852
because it's not flat.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.020
I'm gonna try to flatten it out.

22:01.053 --> 22:04.457
Get it close as I can.

22:04.491 --> 22:05.925
- I think it was a good idea

22:05.958 --> 22:08.361
to try to support
that center section.

22:08.395 --> 22:10.129
It would have been nice
to see him try to support

22:10.162 --> 22:13.366
the entire blade,
but that ship's sailed.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.034
[laughing]
I'm sorry.

22:15.067 --> 22:18.471
I'll stop.

22:18.505 --> 22:20.407
- My game plan with, like,
using the bronze as just, like,

22:20.440 --> 22:22.442
a little inlay,

22:22.475 --> 22:24.377
so I cut out a little piece.

22:24.411 --> 22:26.579
*

22:26.613 --> 22:28.515
With these time restraints
I'm not going to try

22:28.548 --> 22:30.617
to do anything too flashy
on the bronze.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.619
[laughs]

22:32.652 --> 22:34.587
It's gonna look like [bleep],
but hell.

22:34.621 --> 22:36.088
- So it looks like Shawn has

22:36.122 --> 22:39.158
set that bronze pin
in his handle.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.728
- Easy peazy lemon squeezy.
You know what I'm saying?

22:41.761 --> 22:43.563
I mean it's there.

22:43.596 --> 22:45.398
They said all's you
gotta do is see it.

22:45.432 --> 22:46.833
You know,
there's a lot going on.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.801
You're looking at the clock.

22:48.835 --> 22:50.002
If I don't thin up the blade,
put an edge on it,

22:50.036 --> 22:53.440
I'll get sent home.

22:53.473 --> 22:55.508
- All right.
I see this bronze propeller,

22:55.542 --> 22:56.876
and I immediately go,
"Liners for the handles."

22:56.909 --> 22:59.011
Easy.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.548
I'm thinking, you know,
this propeller is fairly thin,

23:01.581 --> 23:02.749
and then I get up to it,
and I'm like,

23:02.782 --> 23:04.684
"Oh, this thing is a beast."

23:04.717 --> 23:10.423
*

23:10.457 --> 23:13.493
- There we go.

23:13.526 --> 23:14.894
- And then I start grinding,

23:14.927 --> 23:17.163
and it's taking a long time.

23:17.196 --> 23:19.432
*

23:19.466 --> 23:21.701
I made a big mistake,
and time's just ticking away,

23:21.734 --> 23:25.137
and I go, "You know,
I got to change my plan."

23:25.171 --> 23:27.874
So I cut off a couple pieces.
I'm gonna make a brass pin.

23:27.907 --> 23:30.543
This is an absolute
sink-or-swim moment for me.

23:30.577 --> 23:33.580
And then I realize it's taking
a while to get into shape.

23:33.613 --> 23:35.748
I only have enough time
for one pin.

23:35.782 --> 23:39.786
- So now I need to try to make
a sturdy, decent handle.

23:39.819 --> 23:41.988
So I see this pretty blue stuff.

23:42.021 --> 23:45.525
It looks like it would fit in
with the nautical theme.

23:45.558 --> 23:47.727
- If Buster doesn't
index that blade well,

23:47.760 --> 23:49.529
when we're doing
these strength tests,

23:49.562 --> 23:51.764
if it hits and deflects down,

23:51.798 --> 23:54.867
it can knock that blade
right out of alignment.

23:54.901 --> 23:57.570
- It's not matching up
exactly right,

23:57.604 --> 23:59.506
but I think it'll work.

23:59.539 --> 24:01.107
[dramatic music]

24:01.140 --> 24:03.209
I'm grinding over on the belt,

24:03.242 --> 24:07.614
and I was thinking this blue
material was more forgiving.

24:07.647 --> 24:10.750
*

24:10.783 --> 24:13.219
- Uh-oh.
- Son of a bitch.

24:13.252 --> 24:20.192
All of a sudden, I get a crack.
Boy, I feel sick to my stomach.

24:20.226 --> 24:23.896
Oh, [bleep], I think I need
to go find another piece.

24:23.930 --> 24:25.865
- Yeah, it's a little late
in the game

24:25.898 --> 24:28.668
to have to peel
those scales off.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.537
- There was
no more blue like that,

24:30.570 --> 24:32.138
so I just say
it's gonna have to live

24:32.171 --> 24:34.173
with a crack in it.

24:34.206 --> 24:35.642
Have to support that handle
some way or another,

24:35.675 --> 24:39.512
so I go and get another pin.

24:39.546 --> 24:42.114
Another pin in the middle that
would help reinforce the handle,

24:42.148 --> 24:44.751
so it would stay on.

24:44.784 --> 24:46.719
I'd like to spend more time
on the sharpness,

24:46.753 --> 24:49.756
but I've got to spend more time
with this handle.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.691
I'm a little worried.

24:51.724 --> 24:53.225
- Time to get my scales on.

24:53.259 --> 24:54.527
Time to incorporate
the bronze pin.

24:54.561 --> 24:56.663
Get my copper pin in there.

24:56.696 --> 24:59.632
And this thing just goes
together like one, two, three.

24:59.666 --> 25:02.735
- She worked a simple,
single front pin.

25:02.769 --> 25:04.904
Pushed it through.
She's got a "Damn the torpedoes,

25:04.937 --> 25:08.074
full speed ahead," attitude.
[laughs]

25:08.107 --> 25:10.309
What?
Am I going overboard?

25:10.342 --> 25:14.681
There are a boatload of jokes
going on in this room today.

25:14.714 --> 25:16.048
- I'm quitting.
Gotta leave.

25:16.082 --> 25:18.718
I can't take it anymore.

25:18.751 --> 25:20.319
- I put my blade
in the ferric chloride

25:20.352 --> 25:22.221
just to check for flaws.

25:22.254 --> 25:25.024
It'll make sure that the W2
is all on the edge.

25:25.057 --> 25:27.059
If you etch it,
it's going to reveal the beauty.

25:27.093 --> 25:29.195
I'd say that's purty.

25:29.228 --> 25:31.798
- That looks real nice.
- It looks like it's got maybe

25:31.831 --> 25:35.167
a half an inch of exposed
steel at the base of that blade.

25:35.201 --> 25:37.704
- That's ideal.

25:37.737 --> 25:39.939
- I think I'm stacking it
pretty good.

25:39.972 --> 25:42.775
That will kill.

25:42.809 --> 25:45.678
- Ten, nine, eight,

25:45.712 --> 25:48.748
seven, six, five,

25:48.781 --> 25:50.717
four, three,

25:50.750 --> 25:52.952
two, one.

25:52.985 --> 25:56.789
Bladesmiths, time is up!
Good job.

25:56.823 --> 26:00.827
Please secure your blades,
and return to your anvils.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.228
- I'm really worried
about my knife,

26:02.261 --> 26:04.330
because I got a cracked handle,

26:04.363 --> 26:07.333
I got a blade's forged
in too narrow in the middle.

26:07.366 --> 26:09.368
I'm not proud of it is all.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.604
- I'm feeling pretty confident.

26:11.638 --> 26:13.372
This thing is made
for basically kicking ass

26:13.405 --> 26:15.241
and taking names,

26:15.274 --> 26:16.843
and this is what this blade
is meant to do,

26:16.876 --> 26:20.780
and it's what it's going to do.

26:20.813 --> 26:22.982
- All right, bladesmiths.
Welcome to our strength test.

26:23.015 --> 26:26.085
Today is the wooden crate chop.
I'm a take each of your blades

26:26.118 --> 26:28.855
and attempt ten strikes
through this wooden crate.

26:28.888 --> 26:30.990
It's going to test the overall
durability of your knife,

26:31.023 --> 26:33.325
edge-holding,
and we're gonna see

26:33.359 --> 26:34.994
not what your blades can do
to this crate,

26:35.027 --> 26:37.263
but what the crate can do
to your blades.

26:37.296 --> 26:38.998
Shawn, you're up first.
You ready?

26:39.031 --> 26:41.701
- Yes, sir.
- Let's have some fun.

26:41.734 --> 26:43.970
- My blade's a lot heavier
than my competitors,

26:44.003 --> 26:45.404
so I think it's gonna
perform real well.

26:45.437 --> 26:48.040
Let her rip, tater chip.
I'm ready.

26:48.074 --> 26:54.981
*

27:07.226 --> 27:09.195
- That's what
a chopper should do.

27:09.228 --> 27:11.397
Just a few little things.

27:11.430 --> 27:14.333
Right in here, in your choil,
that's sharp.

27:14.366 --> 27:16.235
I'd have like to have
seen that taken down.

27:16.268 --> 27:18.037
Narrowing down here
would have made it

27:18.070 --> 27:19.672
a little more comfortable too.

27:19.706 --> 27:21.708
Swinging something
this big and heavy

27:21.741 --> 27:23.375
you want to have
as much control as possible.

27:23.409 --> 27:26.078
Contouring with that palm swell
in there

27:26.112 --> 27:28.214
is a big help in holding
and wielding this knife.

27:28.247 --> 27:30.416
No damage to the edge
or anything.

27:30.449 --> 27:32.719
Nicely done.
- Thank you.

27:32.752 --> 27:34.954
- Rachel, are you ready?
- I'm ready.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.256
- All right, let's do it.

27:37.289 --> 27:39.926
- I actually feel pretty good,
but you really just never know.

27:39.959 --> 27:42.995
In the knife-making world,
anything can happen.

27:43.029 --> 27:44.831
This is the moment you separate
the dogs from the puppies.

27:44.864 --> 27:51.804
*

28:01.748 --> 28:03.249
Wow.
[laughs]

28:03.282 --> 28:05.985
Oh, my God.
- You okay?

28:06.018 --> 28:08.988
- I'm high on life right now.

28:09.021 --> 28:12.759
- Well, Rachel, you lost
that little flake there.

28:12.792 --> 28:15.294
Nothing else seems
to have opened up.

28:15.327 --> 28:17.063
The biggest problem I have
with this knife is the balance.

28:17.096 --> 28:19.131
There's a lot of weight up here.

28:19.165 --> 28:22.368
There's not a lot of knife
to support that tip,

28:22.401 --> 28:24.103
and whenever I'd strike
on the crate

28:24.136 --> 28:26.138
it's actually smashing into me,

28:26.172 --> 28:28.074
in the webbing of the hand
right there.

28:28.107 --> 28:29.408
Your edge is good though.

28:29.441 --> 28:31.243
It's still sharp.

28:31.277 --> 28:32.979
Held up nicely.
Good job.

28:33.012 --> 28:35.347
- Thank you.
- Buster, how you feeling?

28:35.381 --> 28:38.450
- Insecure now.
[laughter]

28:38.484 --> 28:41.053
- Let's do it.

28:41.087 --> 28:43.455
- When J. picks up my knife
I'm thinking,

28:43.489 --> 28:46.058
"I know there's a lot of flaws
in my blade,"

28:46.092 --> 28:48.494
so I just don't know
what's gonna happen.

28:48.527 --> 28:51.197
I'm nervous right now.

28:54.133 --> 29:00.306
*

29:11.884 --> 29:15.154
Well, Buster, we've got a crack
going from spine to edge.

29:15.187 --> 29:16.856
Right where that thin spot is.

29:16.889 --> 29:18.490
- I figured it was.

29:18.524 --> 29:21.260
- That is a serious malfunction
right there.

29:21.293 --> 29:23.295
It's only being held

29:23.329 --> 29:25.497
in this little belly
of the clip,

29:25.531 --> 29:28.868
and if we go to straighten it
for a sharpness test,

29:28.901 --> 29:31.270
I feel it's gonna break off.
- I understand.

29:31.303 --> 29:32.939
- I'm sorry,
but for safety reasons

29:32.972 --> 29:34.306
we're not gonna be able
to proceed

29:34.340 --> 29:35.341
with the sharpness test
with your knife.

29:35.374 --> 29:38.077
- Okay.

29:38.110 --> 29:40.279
- Bladesmiths, the tests here
in the Forge

29:40.312 --> 29:43.149
are designed to be intentionally
brutal for a reason.

29:43.182 --> 29:45.284
Not every bladesmith
makes a blade

29:45.317 --> 29:47.353
that can complete the tests.

29:47.386 --> 29:49.856
Buster,
unfortunately your weapon

29:49.889 --> 29:52.058
has suffered catastrophic
blade failure.

29:52.091 --> 29:55.594
I'm gonna have to ask you
to please leave the Forge.

29:55.627 --> 29:58.230
- I'm feeling very disappointed.
I just came to prove to myself

29:58.264 --> 29:59.966
that I could compete,

29:59.999 --> 30:02.969
and that I was
better than something.

30:03.002 --> 30:08.240
*

30:08.274 --> 30:10.276
- Rachel, Shawn,
congratulations.

30:10.309 --> 30:12.278
Your work
on your nautically-themed blades

30:12.311 --> 30:13.913
have propelled you
into the final round

30:13.946 --> 30:15.915
of this competition.

30:15.948 --> 30:17.616
Now, we're sending you back
to your home forges

30:17.649 --> 30:20.519
for five days to recreate
an iconic weapon from history.

30:20.552 --> 30:24.323
That weapon is...

30:24.356 --> 30:25.858
the Kachin dao.

30:25.892 --> 30:28.995
*

30:29.028 --> 30:31.263
- The Kachin dao was
the weapon of choice

30:31.297 --> 30:33.199
for the Kachin tribe of Myanmar.

30:33.232 --> 30:35.234
Known for their disciplined
fighting skills,

30:35.267 --> 30:38.037
the Kachin people used this
terrifying slaughter tool

30:38.070 --> 30:40.973
to decapitate their enemies
leading them to become

30:41.007 --> 30:44.076
one of the most feared
headhunting tribes in the world.

30:44.110 --> 30:45.577
The sharp,
single-edged blade

30:45.611 --> 30:47.579
flares out
to a widened square tip

30:47.613 --> 30:50.316
that delivers
lethal slashing blows

30:50.349 --> 30:52.084
and proves to still be
a deadly weapon

30:52.118 --> 30:53.585
in popular television shows

30:53.619 --> 30:56.455
like "Spartacus:
War of the Damned."

30:56.488 --> 31:00.326
It must be an authentic,
working version of this weapon.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.494
You do this well,
and you could walk away

31:02.528 --> 31:05.164
with $10,000 and a new title.

31:05.197 --> 31:08.200
After five days, you will return
and present your blades

31:08.234 --> 31:10.202
to a panel of expert judges.

31:10.236 --> 31:12.338
Bon voyage, bladesmiths.

31:12.371 --> 31:13.605
- All right.

31:13.639 --> 31:15.341
Great.

31:15.374 --> 31:19.478
[rock music]

31:19.511 --> 31:22.214
All right, here we go.
The blade I'm making today is--

31:22.248 --> 31:24.250
it kind of just
almost looks like a machete.

31:24.283 --> 31:26.185
This particular type of sword
is more of a chopper.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.220
It don't have a point.
Just got--

31:28.254 --> 31:30.689
there's a flat end on the end.
Some are just straight.

31:30.722 --> 31:33.525
I like a little bit of radius
on mine, personally.

31:33.559 --> 31:35.361
Right here I think will be it.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.563
The material that
I'm chosen is 51-60.

31:37.596 --> 31:39.565
It's made for chopping.
It's gonna be a perfect fit

31:39.598 --> 31:41.567
for this build I'm fixing to do.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.202
I'm just gonna try to get
the initial look of it,

31:43.235 --> 31:44.937
and the size of it,
and then I'll start

31:44.971 --> 31:46.472
forging the edge down,
and go from there.

31:46.505 --> 31:48.440
You got to really think
outside the box,

31:48.474 --> 31:49.541
and that's one
of the good things about it.

31:49.575 --> 31:51.410
I mean it's just not the norm.

31:51.443 --> 31:55.214
It's something
different altogether.

31:55.247 --> 31:57.549
Oh, yeah.
Everything went pretty well,

31:57.583 --> 32:00.619
but I may have a problem.

32:00.652 --> 32:02.688
The quench tank I have
right now--

32:02.721 --> 32:05.024
it's only capable of quenching
blades up to 13 inches.

32:05.057 --> 32:07.026
This blade is a lot bigger.

32:07.059 --> 32:09.561
The quench is the most important
part of the whole build,

32:09.595 --> 32:13.432
and so I have to go and just
rig me up another quench tank.

32:13.465 --> 32:15.401
I'm nervous.

32:15.434 --> 32:18.504
*

32:18.537 --> 32:20.506
- I'm at home.
I'm at my forge.

32:20.539 --> 32:22.274
Today I'm hoping I can get
a rough shape forged in

32:22.308 --> 32:24.376
or at least drawn out
to about the shape I need.

32:24.410 --> 32:26.278
I'm definitely
designing as I go.

32:26.312 --> 32:28.114
I've never made anything
quite like this before.

32:28.147 --> 32:30.182
That's what I'm hoping
to use right here.

32:30.216 --> 32:31.984
I'm actually gonna try and make
this out of a leaf spring.

32:32.018 --> 32:34.153
I feel it will give me
a better chance

32:34.186 --> 32:37.189
with dimensions, length,
all that.

32:37.223 --> 32:39.591
I really want
to stay historically correct.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.727
Accuracy, for me, when it comes
to recreating something

32:41.760 --> 32:44.130
is really important.

32:44.163 --> 32:47.366
I'm trying to put the flare in
so it tapers down to the handle.

32:47.399 --> 32:48.634
Getting that flare in there
is definitely

32:48.667 --> 32:51.770
the most difficult aspect of it.

32:51.803 --> 32:54.240
I'm not even making a dent.
Not even a little bit.

32:54.273 --> 32:56.008
It's not drawing out as easily

32:56.042 --> 32:58.044
as I am used
to steel drawing out at.

32:58.077 --> 32:59.645
It's a heavy piece of steel.
It takes a lot of heat.

32:59.678 --> 33:00.412
It takes a lot of time.

33:02.548 --> 33:04.683
Might have to try two burners.

33:04.716 --> 33:06.385
My forge is just not big enough.

33:06.418 --> 33:08.187
Not strong enough.
Not hot enough.

33:08.220 --> 33:10.489
I need to double
the size of my forge.

33:10.522 --> 33:14.360
*

33:14.393 --> 33:16.128
- Let's rock and roll.

33:16.162 --> 33:17.763
Yesterday I spent
most of the time

33:17.796 --> 33:20.266
grinding this blade
and just profiling it.

33:20.299 --> 33:23.602
She's just ready, so I'm gonna
kick all my heat treat up.

33:23.635 --> 33:25.437
Today's gonna be
the heat treat day.

33:25.471 --> 33:27.206
Go ahead and clean this up here.

33:27.239 --> 33:29.241
This blade is
considerably big though.

33:29.275 --> 33:31.543
I have to go rig me up
another quench tank.

33:31.577 --> 33:33.645
I would say that's it.

33:33.679 --> 33:36.148
Heat treat is the main part
of the whole thing.

33:36.182 --> 33:37.616
If you don't get
your heat treat correct,

33:37.649 --> 33:39.451
you're setting yourself
for failure.

33:39.485 --> 33:41.553
[exhales]

33:41.587 --> 33:44.523
Everything's gone just really
well with the grinding,

33:44.556 --> 33:46.358
the forging, and I'd sure hate

33:46.392 --> 33:48.494
for something bad
to happen right now.

33:48.527 --> 33:50.429
Really don't want to feel
that little ting.

33:50.462 --> 33:54.166
Luckily, that's never
happened to me.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.434
Shazam.

33:55.467 --> 33:57.603
[grinding]
Oh, [bleep].

33:57.636 --> 33:59.505
That whole thing's just going...
[buzzes]

33:59.538 --> 34:01.207
That's one thing
that you don't want to hear.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.175
It could be a weak spot.
If it cracks,

34:03.209 --> 34:04.743
then I'll have
to start all over again,

34:04.776 --> 34:05.777
and I don't even know
if I have enough time

34:05.811 --> 34:10.116
to build another one.

34:10.149 --> 34:12.518
*

34:12.551 --> 34:15.121
My God, that scared me there
for a second too.

34:15.154 --> 34:17.523
Luckily, blade come out good.

34:17.556 --> 34:20.526
Straight.
Hell yeah.

34:20.559 --> 34:22.328
*

34:22.361 --> 34:23.829
- Ah!
I got two burners.

34:23.862 --> 34:26.132
I spent yesterday
making another forge.

34:26.165 --> 34:28.567
Imagine if I had this
from the very beginning.

34:28.600 --> 34:31.837
Oh, man. That's going down
like butter, at this point.

34:31.870 --> 34:33.739
My plan right now is I'm gonna
flatten out this leaf spring.

34:33.772 --> 34:35.474
I'm gonna get my tang cut out,

34:35.507 --> 34:36.842
but I'm gonna keep
the handle on,

34:36.875 --> 34:38.477
so I have something to hold onto

34:38.510 --> 34:40.112
when I dunk it
in the quench tank.

34:40.146 --> 34:41.813
I want my quench
to be nighttime.

34:41.847 --> 34:43.215
I want to take advantage
of the lack of sunlight

34:43.249 --> 34:44.816
to know I have my colors right.

34:44.850 --> 34:46.852
It's the moment of truth.

34:46.885 --> 34:48.854
It'll basically tell me
if I'm heading back to Brooklyn

34:48.887 --> 34:52.424
with a Kachin dao
or scrap metal.

34:52.458 --> 34:58.230
*

34:58.264 --> 34:59.498
When I pull it out
I don't hear nothing.

34:59.531 --> 35:00.866
Everything feels great.

35:00.899 --> 35:03.569
No tingling.
Nothing.

35:03.602 --> 35:05.337
It's done.

35:05.371 --> 35:07.273
Feeling like a proud mom.

35:07.306 --> 35:09.441
I have a successfully
hardened blade.

35:09.475 --> 35:12.178
- Today I'd like
to just test the blade.

35:12.211 --> 35:14.413
You need to check the edge and
make sure that it don't crack.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.415
That's some hard stuff
too there, buddy.

35:16.448 --> 35:19.885
*

35:19.918 --> 35:21.720
It's still sharp.
Good.

35:21.753 --> 35:24.590
Now it's time
for me to do fit and finish.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.825
I'm just drawing the tang
just to soften it up.

35:26.858 --> 35:28.427
Dang sure don't want it brittle.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.462
Brittle breaks.

35:30.496 --> 35:31.730
I'm gonna go
with a hidden tang construction.

35:31.763 --> 35:33.732
It's a good fit.

35:33.765 --> 35:35.834
The full tang
would be a little stronger,

35:35.867 --> 35:37.603
but I think the hidden tang
will serve this blade well.

35:37.636 --> 35:38.670
I think the blade
come out really good.

35:38.704 --> 35:40.672
It's got a good balance to it.

35:40.706 --> 35:43.242
It should perform outstanding.

35:43.275 --> 35:45.177
The only thing
that I'd fear the most

35:45.211 --> 35:46.878
would be
chopping through bone.

35:46.912 --> 35:48.880
That bone is tough.
It's rough on the edge,

35:48.914 --> 35:50.449
but other than that
I absolutely think

35:50.482 --> 35:52.751
I have a winner on my hands.
Yes, sir.

35:52.784 --> 35:53.919
- I still got some things
I gotta finish.

35:53.952 --> 35:55.721
Got to get the handle on.

35:55.754 --> 35:56.788
I got to put an edge
on this thing.

35:56.822 --> 35:58.757
Repurposing is my thing.

35:58.790 --> 36:01.460
I make all my knives
from refurbished materials.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.195
This one I'm thinking
furniture leg.

36:03.229 --> 36:04.930
Already got the flare
in it I need.

36:04.963 --> 36:06.465
It's actually about
the length I need.

36:06.498 --> 36:08.434
Think smarter, not harder.

36:08.467 --> 36:10.236
*

36:10.269 --> 36:11.737
I got to make
some rice paste glue.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.872
Trying to stay traditional here.

36:13.905 --> 36:15.807
That was typically how things
were done in Asian countries.

36:15.841 --> 36:17.509
There, now it's doing
as I want it to do.

36:17.543 --> 36:19.278
I have done hidden tang handles.

36:19.311 --> 36:20.379
I've never done one
with rice paste,

36:20.412 --> 36:22.948
so I'm really hoping this works.

36:22.981 --> 36:24.583
I got to wrap
the handle in hemp.

36:24.616 --> 36:25.684
Put an edge on it.

36:25.717 --> 36:28.720
*

36:28.754 --> 36:32.224
I'm gonna say this is done.

36:32.258 --> 36:35.727
I didn't get enough
of the rice paste in the handle,

36:35.761 --> 36:38.297
so there's a slight wobble
in there,

36:38.330 --> 36:40.566
but I don't think
this thing's coming apart.

36:40.599 --> 36:42.234
Time will tell.

36:42.268 --> 36:46.905
*

36:46.938 --> 36:50.242
- Shawn, Rachel,
welcome back to the Forge.

36:50.276 --> 36:52.478
You've had five days
at your home forge

36:52.511 --> 36:55.447
to work on your Kachin daos.
Shawn, how did it go?

36:55.481 --> 36:57.283
- It went real well.

36:57.316 --> 36:59.017
*

36:59.050 --> 37:02.288
I chose the 51-60
to forge my blade.

37:02.321 --> 37:03.789
Hand set and finished,

37:03.822 --> 37:06.024
and the handle
I did a canvas Micarta.

37:06.057 --> 37:09.361
- Is it a $10,000 blade?
- Yes, sir, I do believe so.

37:09.395 --> 37:10.862
- Rachel, how'd it go for you?

37:10.896 --> 37:14.266
- It was interesting,
to say the least.

37:14.300 --> 37:16.468
I ended up going
with a leaf spring.

37:16.502 --> 37:18.670
I stuck with
my repurposing mantra,

37:18.704 --> 37:20.706
and used a table leg
for a handle,

37:20.739 --> 37:22.374
and did a hemp wrap.

37:22.408 --> 37:24.476
- Feel like
it's a $10,000 weapon?

37:24.510 --> 37:26.378
- I feel it is.

37:26.412 --> 37:27.946
- Well, bladesmiths,
your weapons will now

37:27.979 --> 37:29.681
be put through
a series of brutal tests.

37:29.715 --> 37:31.383
They're designed this way,

37:31.417 --> 37:33.752
to set your weapons apart
from one another.

37:33.785 --> 37:36.322
Up first is the kill test.

37:36.355 --> 37:38.890
Doug?

37:38.924 --> 37:41.793
- The Kachin dao was used
to battle the jungles in Burma.

37:41.827 --> 37:43.729
It was also a weapon used

37:43.762 --> 37:46.365
to give them
the title of headhunters.

37:46.398 --> 37:49.501
To see what kind of damage
your Kachin daos will do,

37:49.535 --> 37:51.737
I will take your weapon
and deliver slashing blows

37:51.770 --> 37:53.705
on this ballistics dummy.
Shawn, you're up first.

37:53.739 --> 37:54.973
Are you ready?
- Yes, sir.

37:55.006 --> 37:57.509
- Let's do this.

37:57.543 --> 37:59.311
- There's a lot of things
that could happen

37:59.345 --> 38:01.713
when they go through the test.
A small chip.

38:01.747 --> 38:03.915
Failure, so I'm just
thinking the whole time,

38:03.949 --> 38:05.517
"Oh, my God."

38:05.551 --> 38:12.491
*

38:20.599 --> 38:24.370
There's the jawbone.
- [laughs]

38:24.403 --> 38:26.538
- Well, Shawn,
initial contact in here

38:26.572 --> 38:29.641
disemboweled
this ballistics dummy.

38:29.675 --> 38:32.344
On a chop right here,
it definitely chopped

38:32.378 --> 38:35.447
and cut all the way
into the jaw.

38:35.481 --> 38:37.383
On the backhand swing,

38:37.416 --> 38:41.387
you pretty much
chopped the skull open.

38:41.420 --> 38:43.455
The blade feels good
in the hand.

38:43.489 --> 38:46.992
It lacerates.
It moves well.

38:47.025 --> 38:50.429
Your weapon will kill.

38:50.462 --> 38:51.963
- It's just like a big relief
since that thing's

38:51.997 --> 38:54.566
done everything
that I thought it would.

38:54.600 --> 38:58.404
You put your mind to something,
and you can make it happen.

38:58.437 --> 38:59.938
- Rachel, it's your turn.
Are you ready?

38:59.971 --> 39:03.041
- Ready as ever.
- Let's do this.

39:03.074 --> 39:06.745
- Coming out to testing really
was like a reality check,

39:06.778 --> 39:08.514
and I just go, "Oh, man.
This is the time

39:08.547 --> 39:10.649
where they get to say

39:10.682 --> 39:13.118
whether I sink or swim."

39:13.151 --> 39:15.587
- Mine's real heavy.

39:17.122 --> 39:20.859
*

39:20.892 --> 39:22.394
[clacking]

39:22.428 --> 39:24.663
*

39:24.696 --> 39:27.165
- Rachel, there is an issue
with your blade.

39:27.198 --> 39:32.838
It's rattling.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.139
*

39:34.172 --> 39:36.041
I got to ask you.

39:36.074 --> 39:38.076
What's your construction
with your handle?

39:38.109 --> 39:41.146
- That is a solid handle,
and I did a wood pin,

39:41.179 --> 39:43.649
and then I wrapped it
with rice glue.

39:43.682 --> 39:45.584
- Okay, rice glue,
so there's no epoxy?

39:45.617 --> 39:47.653
- I kept it traditional
with traditional adhesives

39:47.686 --> 39:51.423
and then the three layers
of hemp wrap.

39:51.457 --> 39:53.592
- The fact that you have
a wooden pin in there

39:53.625 --> 39:55.494
and the rice glue--
it shouldn't move

39:55.527 --> 39:58.063
if it's traditional,
and it's moving.

39:58.096 --> 40:01.600
And that's a big concern
whether it's gonna stay there.

40:01.633 --> 40:03.502
This competition--
first and foremost,

40:03.535 --> 40:06.538
is always about safety first,

40:06.572 --> 40:09.007
and the kind of force
that I want to deliver over here

40:09.040 --> 40:12.678
is the kind of force
that I delivered to that.

40:12.711 --> 40:15.647
So I don't want to hold back,

40:15.681 --> 40:17.916
for fairness of testing,

40:17.949 --> 40:20.719
and I have no confidence

40:20.752 --> 40:23.021
that with everybody
being this close

40:23.054 --> 40:27.225
and the amount of delivery
I have to do on this dummy--

40:27.258 --> 40:29.628
it's a big safety issue.

40:29.661 --> 40:31.597
Um...

40:31.630 --> 40:34.065
I'm really afraid that
this knife is gonna fly out.

40:34.099 --> 40:36.201
- I'm crushed.
I wanted this weapon

40:36.234 --> 40:38.537
to be tested.
I want to see what it could do,

40:38.570 --> 40:40.572
but I didn't get enough time
to really test this thing,

40:40.606 --> 40:44.576
and here's the end result.

40:44.610 --> 40:47.012
- Rachel,
Doug and the other judges

40:47.045 --> 40:49.648
have issued me
a vote of "no confidence"

40:49.681 --> 40:52.050
in your weapon's
overall construction,

40:52.083 --> 40:54.853
which means that
we cannot test it fairly

40:54.886 --> 40:56.655
compared to Shawn's blade,

40:56.688 --> 40:59.257
and therefore your blade
did not make the cut,

40:59.290 --> 41:00.992
and I have to ask you

41:01.026 --> 41:04.229
to please leave the Forge.

41:04.262 --> 41:06.498
- My aim was
historical accuracy,

41:06.532 --> 41:09.768
but it just came down to
I did not use enough rice glue.

41:09.801 --> 41:12.671
My first time using it.
This was a lot of firsts for me.

41:12.704 --> 41:14.806
My next step will be
to make a worthy Kachin dao,

41:14.840 --> 41:17.142
and I want to hang it
on my wall.

41:17.175 --> 41:19.811
I got you, Kachin dao.
You know, like, now we're even.

41:19.845 --> 41:22.614
[laughs]

41:22.648 --> 41:25.050
- Shawn, congratulations.

41:25.083 --> 41:27.018
You are
the "Forged in Fire" champion

41:27.052 --> 41:30.188
and will be receiving
a check for $10,000.

41:30.221 --> 41:31.757
Good job.
[applause]

41:31.790 --> 41:34.025
- Thank you.

41:34.059 --> 41:36.695
- Weapon's definitely a killer.
How do you feel?

41:36.728 --> 41:38.630
- I feel great.
I mean I would like to have seen

41:38.664 --> 41:40.165
that thing go through
all the other challenges,

41:40.198 --> 41:42.000
but oh, well.
I'm just tickled to death.

41:42.033 --> 41:44.002
- Well, congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

41:44.035 --> 41:45.303
Proud.
Very proud of what I've done.

41:45.336 --> 41:46.972
- Good job.

41:47.005 --> 41:48.907
- That's why I'm here, you know?

41:48.940 --> 41:51.843
- Congratulations, sir.
- I won "Forged in Fire."

41:51.877 --> 41:53.745
Yeah, baby.
[laughs]

41:53.779 --> 41:55.213
I'd like to have
that head right there.

41:55.246 --> 41:57.549
- Here you go.

41:57.583 --> 42:00.251
[laughs]

42:00.285 --> 42:06.692
