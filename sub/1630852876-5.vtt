WEBVTT

00:08.655 --> 00:11.724
[Narrator] Reaching the other side of
the world is a dream many of us share.

00:11.758 --> 00:16.068
But by flying over, are we
forgetting how to travel through?

00:19.758 --> 00:25.241
Mexico City, North
America's largest Metropolis,

00:25.275 --> 00:30.000
to ushuaia, Argentina, the
most southerly city in the world.

00:30.620 --> 00:33.137
Twenty hours by plane.

00:33.172 --> 00:37.862
But could you travel the length
of Latin America at ground level?

00:37.896 --> 00:40.482
And all for the
price of the airfare?

00:40.517 --> 00:42.689
[Sam] What have
we got ourselves into?

00:42.724 --> 00:45.862
Five pairs of ordinary
brits are attempting just that.

00:45.896 --> 00:47.655
Let's go.

00:47.689 --> 00:50.862
They will cover over
25,000 kilometers.

00:52.379 --> 00:55.000
Moments like this you will
remember for the rest of your life.

00:55.034 --> 00:58.758
And a demanding
and challenging race

00:58.793 --> 01:01.034
which soars high into the andes,

01:01.068 --> 01:03.379
crosses vast deserts,

01:03.413 --> 01:06.896
and navigates some of the
world's most volatile regions.

01:07.827 --> 01:09.275
He's coming over with a gun.

01:10.448 --> 01:12.310
Have they got what it takes?

01:12.344 --> 01:15.103
[Sam] Got no Google maps,
got no mom, got nothing.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.344
Both physically...

01:17.379 --> 01:19.034
[Lizzie] Shall I
call an ambulance?

01:19.068 --> 01:20.931
And emotionally.

01:20.965 --> 01:22.896
We need a miracle
to get out of here.

01:23.689 --> 01:25.275
The rewards are great.

01:25.310 --> 01:27.103
This is crazy good.

01:27.137 --> 01:28.965
[Emon] This has brought
us closer together.

01:30.103 --> 01:32.137
[Narrator] The first
team to the finish line

01:32.172 --> 01:34.965
will claim the prize of £20,000,

01:36.413 --> 01:37.517
in a race...

01:37.551 --> 01:38.551
[Man] Let's go, let's go.

01:38.586 --> 01:39.620
Across the world.

01:39.655 --> 01:41.000
[Dom] Vamos, vamos.

01:41.034 --> 01:43.551
Excitement, adventure, trauma.

01:44.965 --> 01:45.965
Oh, my god.

01:50.448 --> 01:52.172
[Narrator] Previously...

01:52.206 --> 01:54.586
The fourth checkpoint
is puno, Peru.

01:54.620 --> 01:56.724
The team's climbed
into the andes.

01:56.758 --> 01:58.827
[Lizzie] They
were pretty high up.

01:58.862 --> 02:01.206
[Dom] I felt like my eyes were
gonna pop out of my head.

02:01.241 --> 02:02.724
[Jen] Oh, look at you.

02:02.758 --> 02:06.137
Jen and Rob made
friends with the locals.

02:06.172 --> 02:07.413
[Jen] Sneaky little boy.

02:07.448 --> 02:09.448
You can see her happier,
and that makes me happy.

02:09.482 --> 02:11.275
-Aiming high -we did it.

02:11.310 --> 02:13.586
Cost emon and jamiul their lead.

02:13.620 --> 02:16.793
- [Emon] You got to make bold decisions.
- [Jamiul] It paid off.

02:16.827 --> 02:18.689
[Jamiul] Doing it
before hasn't paid off.

02:18.724 --> 02:20.103
A new plan...

02:20.137 --> 02:23.068
Travel in style and comfort. That's
what we gonna do from now on.

02:23.103 --> 02:25.206
Worked wonders for Jo and Sam.

02:25.241 --> 02:27.344
[Sam] We're really
surprised we came first.

02:27.379 --> 02:29.034
[Dom] Will you help
it go over my back?

02:29.068 --> 02:31.034
While a damp dom and Lizzie...

02:31.068 --> 02:32.275
[Dom grunting]

02:32.310 --> 02:34.172
were left treading water.

02:34.206 --> 02:36.965
Not a place you wanna be
when you feel like this. It's not fun.

02:39.517 --> 02:41.482
[Dramatic music playing]

02:50.448 --> 02:51.482
[Ferry horn honking]

02:54.689 --> 02:57.517
- The sunrise, just absolutely stunning.
- Yeah.

02:57.551 --> 03:01.137
[Narrator] Eight hours and twenty
minutes behind leaders Jo and Sam,

03:01.172 --> 03:04.000
dom and Lizzie reach
the fourth checkpoint.

03:04.034 --> 03:05.413
Dom, can I have a break?

03:05.448 --> 03:07.103
[Dom] Come on,
let's get this done.

03:08.310 --> 03:10.172
- Hello. Buenos días.
- Good morning.

03:10.206 --> 03:11.931
[Inaudible conversation]

03:11.965 --> 03:12.965
[Dom] Right.

03:13.827 --> 03:16.482
Oh, last again.

03:16.517 --> 03:19.689
[Dom] It's frustrating that we've
come last, two times in a row.

03:19.724 --> 03:22.206
We have been pushing
ourselves hard enough, I don't think.

03:22.241 --> 03:24.172
We've got some
catching up to there.

03:27.448 --> 03:30.551
[Narrator] Fifteen thousand
kilometers remained to ushuaia.

03:31.482 --> 03:33.103
But before resuming the race,

03:33.137 --> 03:35.206
the teams are
taking the opportunity

03:35.241 --> 03:36.965
to explore lake titicaca.

03:37.724 --> 03:39.310
[All] Hola.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.931
At nearly 4,000
meters above sea level,

03:41.965 --> 03:45.310
the highest and largest
lake in South America.

03:45.344 --> 03:47.206
Oh, thank you.

03:47.241 --> 03:51.034
It's home to the uros
tribe, an ancient people,

03:51.068 --> 03:52.931
many of whom still
live permanently

03:52.965 --> 03:57.655
on the lakes 120
man-made floating islands,

03:57.689 --> 04:00.448
each constructed
from living reeds.

04:01.655 --> 04:02.655
Boop.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
[Emon] Pick a card.

04:06.482 --> 04:09.172
[Dom] Oh, so they leave
nets here with some bait.

04:09.206 --> 04:10.724
[Sam] That's a big boy.

04:10.758 --> 04:12.344
I'm loving it.

04:12.379 --> 04:13.379
[Emon] Okay, you ready?

04:14.620 --> 04:15.689
[People laughing]

04:19.344 --> 04:20.344
Please don't.

04:23.068 --> 04:25.000
[Sam] That was gruesome.

04:25.034 --> 04:27.448
[Lizzie] Big thing for me is
that I love these checkpoints.

04:27.482 --> 04:28.827
I get to hang out with you guys.

04:28.862 --> 04:31.137
I genuinely enjoy
your company so much.

04:31.172 --> 04:34.758
I think they're sort of making like
we're a weird, dysfunctional family.

04:34.793 --> 04:36.655
[Lizzie] Definitely.

04:36.689 --> 04:39.758
[Dom] We don't really see them
as rivals when we're at checkpoints.

04:39.793 --> 04:43.931
And like we all really get on. And
I actually think, beyond the race,

04:43.965 --> 04:47.758
we'll be friends forever because
we've all shared this unique experience.

04:47.793 --> 04:50.379
Do you think you've got better
in dealing with the bus journey?

04:50.413 --> 04:53.068
- Oh, god, no, god, no.
- No. Is it still bad?

04:53.103 --> 04:54.931
- It's getting even worse and worse.
- Oh, god.

04:54.965 --> 04:58.931
Each bus journey, it's like I
just know what's ahead of me.

04:58.965 --> 05:02.482
[Sam] As much as I have a
downer in getting all the long buses

05:02.517 --> 05:03.896
and not enjoying it,

05:03.931 --> 05:06.862
moments like today
do make it worthwhile.

05:07.551 --> 05:09.827
[Both laughing]

05:09.862 --> 05:11.241
[Sam] We're all
so close together,

05:11.275 --> 05:13.793
and the culture,
it's just warming

05:13.827 --> 05:15.931
to feel that vibe
that they give off.

05:15.965 --> 05:18.379
We've just been astonished
with what we've seen.

05:18.413 --> 05:21.931
[Indistinct chatter]

05:27.586 --> 05:28.758
[Dramatic music playing]

05:30.448 --> 05:32.379
- Buenos días.
- Buenos días.

05:32.413 --> 05:34.517
[Narrator] First to set
off on the fifth leg...

05:34.551 --> 05:35.931
Thank you.

05:35.965 --> 05:38.241
Current leaders, Jo and Sam,

05:38.275 --> 05:41.034
ninety minutes clear
of their closest rivals.

05:43.137 --> 05:46.068
- [Jo] Cafayate, Argentina. Oh!
- [Sam] All right.

05:46.103 --> 05:48.206
- Steaks.
- [Laughs] And red wine.

05:49.655 --> 05:52.793
[Narrator] Sixteen hundred
kilometers south of puno,

05:52.827 --> 05:57.862
the colonial town of cafayate,
the team's first stop in Argentina.

05:57.896 --> 06:00.000
Situated in the
north of the country,

06:00.034 --> 06:03.448
the humidity and rich soil
make it the perfect location

06:03.482 --> 06:06.413
for the vineyards that
thrive in the valley floors.

06:10.551 --> 06:12.689
[Jo] Right, next leg.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.931
[Narrator] To get there,
the teams could choose

06:18.965 --> 06:21.517
to travel through
land-locked Bolivia,

06:21.551 --> 06:24.931
with its otherworldly
landscapes, salt flats,

06:24.965 --> 06:29.517
fossilized dinosaur prints,
and unique rock formations,

06:30.413 --> 06:32.827
or be tempted by
the lower altitudes

06:32.862 --> 06:34.931
of northern Chile's
pacific coast,

06:34.965 --> 06:39.034
breathtaking volcanic vistas,
and the vast atacama desert.

06:40.206 --> 06:42.586
[Dramatic music playing]

06:42.620 --> 06:46.241
[Jo] We know we're going to
Argentina but what would you like to do?

06:46.275 --> 06:48.206
[Sam] If we can
do some cool stuff,

06:48.241 --> 06:51.517
and make the bus rides worth
it, that's what I'd much rather do.

06:51.551 --> 06:54.827
'Cause you see a bus, if
it's there, you wanna take it.

06:54.862 --> 06:57.862
But sometimes you just
need to sit back and relax.

06:57.896 --> 07:00.793
[Jo] So say that happens, you
just need to communicate that,

07:00.827 --> 07:03.482
and then we can get
that happy medium

07:03.517 --> 07:05.275
of enjoying as well as racing.

07:08.413 --> 07:13.482
[Jo] Okay, love, so we're gonna go
through Bolivia to Argentina, yeah?

07:13.517 --> 07:16.310
That's where the salt flats are
and that's where uncle Johnny went.

07:16.344 --> 07:17.758
And it looked absolutely insane.

07:17.793 --> 07:20.793
That'd be fantastic.
It does look stunning.

07:20.827 --> 07:22.965
[Narrator] To
reach the salt flats,

07:23.000 --> 07:25.965
Jo and Sam need to
head to the town of uyuni,

07:26.000 --> 07:28.896
seven hundred and fifty
kilometers into Bolivia.

07:28.931 --> 07:31.379
I think we'd best get on then
and try and get to the border.

07:32.517 --> 07:34.517
[Jen] Hola.
Checking out, please.

07:34.551 --> 07:35.724
[Narrator] Next to leave,

07:35.758 --> 07:37.689
- ready?
- Jen and Rob.

07:37.724 --> 07:39.793
- Cafayate?
- Cafayate?

07:39.827 --> 07:42.172
- [Rob] Hello, hello.
- [Emon] Where are we going?

07:42.206 --> 07:43.827
Back to Mexico City.

07:43.862 --> 07:46.862
- [Jamiul laughs]
- Okay, bye.

07:48.793 --> 07:51.103
[Rob] I think we've been
working much better together.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.862
We've closed the gap
from two and a half hours

07:53.896 --> 07:56.275
to one and a half hours.

07:56.310 --> 07:58.655
- It's working for us. Yeah.
- We're doing all right.

07:58.689 --> 08:00.655
[Rob exclaims]

08:00.689 --> 08:02.137
[Jen laughing]

08:03.655 --> 08:05.344
[Emon] You guys
might as well go first.

08:05.379 --> 08:06.517
Okay, bye.

08:06.551 --> 08:08.000
- Bye, guys.
- Bye. Good luck.

08:10.586 --> 08:13.241
[Jen] Hola, we
need to go to Bolivia.

08:13.275 --> 08:15.724
- [Man speaking foreign language]
- [Jen] Come with this man.

08:15.758 --> 08:16.872
- Look at the map.
- [Rob] Ah.

08:16.896 --> 08:19.310
[Rob speaking Spanish]

08:19.344 --> 08:21.517
- [Rob] Puno. Sí, sí.
- [Jen] Okay.

08:21.551 --> 08:22.586
[Jen] Do we get a boat?

08:22.620 --> 08:23.965
[Man speaking foreign language]

08:25.172 --> 08:27.137
- Not possible.
- Not by the lake.

08:28.310 --> 08:30.758
[Narrator] The border
dissects lake titicaca

08:30.793 --> 08:36.000
so the teams will only be able
to cross into Bolivia by land.

08:36.034 --> 08:38.413
[Jen] We've chosen to go to
Bolivia 'cause actually Bolivia

08:38.448 --> 08:42.379
is one of South America's cheapest
countries to live, eat, and travel.

08:42.413 --> 08:44.448
The downside is,
unfortunately we've been told

08:44.482 --> 08:46.517
that there are
national elections.

08:46.551 --> 08:49.310
It's illegal not to vote, so
the whole country shuts down,

08:49.344 --> 08:51.827
and there won't be any
transport out of the country.

08:51.862 --> 08:56.172
So we've got three days
to get through Bolivia.

08:56.206 --> 08:59.241
[Emon] In South America, I believe
Chile's the most expensive country

08:59.275 --> 09:01.551
because it's the most developed.

09:01.586 --> 09:03.206
I think it'll be
similar to Panama.

09:03.241 --> 09:05.517
- Right. Expensive as well.
- Yeah, expensive.

09:05.551 --> 09:08.793
Where's Bolivia's
got quite a lot to offer.

09:08.827 --> 09:13.172
[Narrator] Also opting for Bolivia,
cash-strapped emon and jamiul.

09:13.206 --> 09:15.344
I think we should do
what we did last time.

09:15.379 --> 09:17.793
- Good experiences and travel hard.
- Yeah.

09:17.827 --> 09:19.862
We might have to travel
harder than we did before.

09:19.896 --> 09:24.275
There's the valley De Luna which
people say it's similar to the moon.

09:24.310 --> 09:26.655
- So that will be kind of cool to do.
- Why not?

09:26.689 --> 09:30.482
[Narrator] The boys went ahead to a
Bolivian landmark known as moon valley

09:30.517 --> 09:33.137
because of its lunar-like
rock formations,

09:33.172 --> 09:36.034
just outside the
capital city, La Paz.

09:36.068 --> 09:37.793
[Emon] La Paz
will be kind of close.

09:39.206 --> 09:42.103
Inspirational. Got us
some good times in Peru.

09:42.137 --> 09:43.758
[Jamiul] Yeah, Peru's
been good to us.

09:45.517 --> 09:47.137
[Narrator] Already
across the border...

09:47.172 --> 09:49.275
[Sam] All right,
we're in Bolivia.

09:49.310 --> 09:51.931
Racing to make a bus
connection to the salt flats

09:51.965 --> 09:56.068
six hundred and fifty eight
kilometers away, Jo and Sam.

09:56.103 --> 09:59.137
We need to try and book
the nighttime bus before 9:00.

09:59.172 --> 10:00.931
We should be there by 7:00.

10:00.965 --> 10:03.000
- Or around that time.
- Exactly. Yeah.

10:06.827 --> 10:10.551
[Jo] This will be
interesting. Oh, my god.

10:16.275 --> 10:17.448
Ahoy.

10:18.482 --> 10:20.551
[Sam] We're literally
on lake titi-bus-bus.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.965
For as far as I can see...

10:24.000 --> 10:25.793
[Jo] Really, lad,
but you're on a ferry.

10:25.827 --> 10:27.172
[Both laugh]

10:28.758 --> 10:30.172
[Lizzie] I wish I had topped up.

10:30.206 --> 10:31.413
[Dom] Right, okay.

10:31.448 --> 10:33.586
[Dom speaking Spanish]

10:33.620 --> 10:37.000
[Narrator] Back in puno, the
last team to leave the checkpoint,

10:37.034 --> 10:39.827
eight hours and twenty
minutes behind the leaders,

10:39.862 --> 10:41.758
dom and Lizzie.

10:41.793 --> 10:44.034
[Dom] This altitude's
made me feel really weird.

10:44.068 --> 10:45.620
[Lizzie] It's
finally hitting you.

10:47.517 --> 10:51.034
[Lizzie] The landscapes in
Chile just sound unbelievable.

10:51.068 --> 10:55.413
[Dom] And we might get to go back
down to sea level away from this altitude

10:55.448 --> 10:57.586
- that is just doing my skull in.
- Yeah.

10:57.620 --> 10:59.965
[Narrator] The only team
to travel through Chile,

11:00.000 --> 11:04.241
dom and Lizzie are looking to head
south to the border tone of tacna.

11:07.275 --> 11:09.068
[Dom] So shall we book a ticket?

11:09.103 --> 11:11.448
-[Lizzie] Yes, please. Get money out first.
-Oh, yeah.

11:12.103 --> 11:14.034
[Thudding]

11:14.068 --> 11:16.482
[Lizzie] Oh! He's having a
seizure, he's having a seizure.

11:16.517 --> 11:18.862
- [Lizzie] Oh, my god, oh, my god.
- [Dom moaning]

11:20.344 --> 11:21.827
[Lizzie] Oh, dom.

11:21.862 --> 11:24.655
- [Man] You're all right.
- [Lizzie] He's had one of these before.

11:24.689 --> 11:27.931
- [Man] You're all right.
- [Lizzie] I can't do it.

11:27.965 --> 11:29.551
[Lizzie] Someone
call an ambulance.

11:31.068 --> 11:33.793
[Narrator] Closely following
each team at all times,

11:33.827 --> 11:36.413
a medic who
immediately tends to dom.

11:36.448 --> 11:38.413
- [Medic] He's fine.
- [Lizzie] Oh, my god.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.000
[Medic] That's it,
there we go, dom.

11:40.034 --> 11:42.517
- [Lizzie] Is he gonna be okay?
- [Medic] It's all right, dom.

11:42.551 --> 11:44.793
[Medic] Just relax.
He's coming back now.

11:46.793 --> 11:48.000
I can't watch.

11:49.862 --> 11:52.206
[Medic] That's it. Rest
on your back, dom.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.517
[Lizzie] That was horrible.

11:55.551 --> 11:57.517
Dom's just had a seizure.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.931
He's had a couple before,
but I've never seen them.

11:59.965 --> 12:03.448
And that was, honestly,
his face, that was petrifying.

12:03.482 --> 12:05.344
[Dom breathing heavily]

12:07.586 --> 12:10.344
It's really scary. And usually,
he'd be the one looking after me,

12:10.379 --> 12:12.172
and now I feel like i'm...

12:12.206 --> 12:14.862
Like I don't know whether
I can do the same for him.

12:14.896 --> 12:16.344
[Lizzie crying]

12:20.275 --> 12:22.241
[Lizzie] I honestly cannot
remember the last time

12:22.275 --> 12:24.931
I said I love you to my
brother, or he said it to me.

12:24.965 --> 12:27.482
[Laughs] I think that's just
because we don't talk about love,

12:27.517 --> 12:29.034
we don't talk about family.

12:29.068 --> 12:31.137
He's getting up.

12:31.172 --> 12:32.931
He's my only sibling.
He's all I've got,

12:32.965 --> 12:35.517
and he's one of the most
important people in my life.

12:40.931 --> 12:42.103
[Dom groans]

12:42.137 --> 12:43.689
- [Lizzie] You all right?
- Yeah.

12:43.724 --> 12:47.034
- [Dom] We've missed our bus?
- [Lizzie] Dom, we're not going anywhere tonight.

12:47.068 --> 12:48.793
[Dom] Oh, what?

12:48.827 --> 12:52.379
[Narrator] With emergency
services in attendance within minutes,

12:52.413 --> 12:55.586
dom is taken to a hospital
in the center of puno.

12:55.620 --> 12:57.448
[Ambulance sirens wailing]

12:57.482 --> 13:01.241
I think they're checking whether the
seizure he had was triggered by altitude.

13:01.275 --> 13:03.137
They're checking
his oxygen and stuff.

13:03.172 --> 13:05.551
He's come back to himself,
he's realized what's happened.

13:05.586 --> 13:07.896
You know, it's obviously,
he's been pushing himself hard.

13:07.931 --> 13:09.891
The altitude's hard and
it's had an effect on him.

13:10.862 --> 13:12.862
It's pretty scary
and quite daunting,

13:12.896 --> 13:14.931
and I really don't know
what more I can do.

13:14.965 --> 13:18.275
Just got to stand by
him, and look after him.

13:18.310 --> 13:22.758
[Narrator] After tests, Don is
advised to rest for 24 hours.

13:22.793 --> 13:26.000
So brother and sister head
back to the checkpoint hotel.

13:26.034 --> 13:27.793
The race, on hold.

13:30.137 --> 13:31.689
[Jo speaking Spanish]

13:33.172 --> 13:37.103
Okay. Sam, we can't
get the bus tonight.

13:37.551 --> 13:38.793
This whole time,

13:38.827 --> 13:42.482
I didn't realize we went
forward an hour in Bolivia.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.379
So, yeah. We'll have
to stay here tonight

13:46.275 --> 13:49.482
[narrator] With no onward
connection to the salt flats today,

13:49.517 --> 13:52.379
Jo and Sam are
stranded in La Paz.

13:52.413 --> 13:54.620
[Jo] This has basically
put us back 24 hours.

13:55.827 --> 13:57.620
[Sam] Oh, my god,
is that a cable car?

13:57.655 --> 14:00.172
[Narrator] Also forced to
pause their journey in this city...

14:00.206 --> 14:01.862
[Emon] I love cable cars.

14:01.896 --> 14:04.275
This better be the longest
cable car in the world.

14:04.310 --> 14:06.206
[Jen] Hola. Buenas noches.

14:06.241 --> 14:08.724
[Narrator] The other two
teams traveling through Bolivia...

14:08.758 --> 14:11.689
[Jen speaking Spanish]

14:11.724 --> 14:16.103
Could you write it down with this
novelty light-up pen that punches?

14:16.137 --> 14:18.000
[Rob laughs]

14:18.034 --> 14:20.862
I'm sorry but my
normal one's gone.

14:20.896 --> 14:24.344
His eyes used to light up but
I think it's run out of battery.

14:24.379 --> 14:26.448
[Sam] I'm pretty glad
we're not on a night bus.

14:26.482 --> 14:29.034
- Yeah.
- Because you can't do this on the night bus.

14:29.068 --> 14:30.206
[Jo chuckles]

14:31.103 --> 14:32.482
[Acoustic guitar music playing]

14:37.172 --> 14:39.517
I can't believe it's only
half six in the morning

14:39.551 --> 14:42.068
and there's so much
hustle and bustle.

14:42.103 --> 14:43.310
They start early, don't they?

14:47.689 --> 14:51.379
[Narrator] Three thousand six hundred
and forty meters above sea level,

14:51.413 --> 14:52.551
La Paz.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.344
The highest
capital in the world,

14:56.379 --> 15:00.241
with a suitably elevated
form of public transport:

15:00.275 --> 15:03.068
The mi teleférico
cable car network.

15:04.551 --> 15:07.724
The city is the birthplace
of cholita wrestling,

15:07.758 --> 15:09.724
[crowd cheering]

15:09.758 --> 15:12.793
Bolivian women's
traditional version of wwe.

15:15.724 --> 15:17.862
[Jo] Well, let's hope that
there is a bus this morning

15:17.896 --> 15:20.689
because otherwise
we've lost 24 hours.

15:20.724 --> 15:24.241
It's a bit of a bugger
not getting it last night.

15:24.275 --> 15:27.137
[Narrator] In the city center,
the main transport hub

15:27.172 --> 15:29.586
designed by
architect gustave eiffel,

15:29.620 --> 15:33.137
better known for his
famous tower in Paris.

15:33.172 --> 15:36.000
[Jo] Gracias, muchas gracias.

15:36.034 --> 15:38.517
[Man speaking Spanish]

15:38.551 --> 15:41.241
[Narrator] After their time
difference confusion from Peru...

15:41.275 --> 15:42.896
[Sam] So what are we
gonna do about food?

15:42.931 --> 15:45.724
[Jo] Let's just see
if we get a bus first.

15:45.758 --> 15:47.827
Jo's eager to get
them back on the road

15:47.862 --> 15:50.068
to the salt flats as
soon as possible.

15:50.103 --> 15:51.517
- [Jo] Hola.
- [Woman] Buenos días.

15:51.551 --> 15:52.689
[Jo] Buenos días.

15:52.724 --> 15:54.517
[Jo and woman speaking Spanish]

15:57.517 --> 16:00.551
No, it's only at 3:30
in the afternoon.

16:00.586 --> 16:02.241
I'm a bit pissed off.

16:02.275 --> 16:03.275
[Dramatic music playing]

16:04.620 --> 16:07.206
So we got up at half five
to try and get morning bus.

16:07.241 --> 16:09.482
We're basically not
progressing in the race,

16:09.517 --> 16:12.068
and I'm still very conscious
of the elections coming up

16:12.103 --> 16:14.551
and any problems that
might come with those.

16:16.482 --> 16:18.689
- [Sam] You all right?
- [Jo] Still tied up.

16:18.724 --> 16:20.241
[Jo] Just feeling a bit rough,

16:20.275 --> 16:23.172
and I think I'll probably need
a couple more hours sleep.

16:23.206 --> 16:25.275
There's been quite a
lot of pressure on me

16:25.310 --> 16:27.931
to try and work out
what's best for you.

16:27.965 --> 16:30.896
I think, all the
things with the buses

16:30.931 --> 16:33.379
has just got on top of me.

16:33.413 --> 16:36.827
I feel like you do take
it a bit too seriously.

16:36.862 --> 16:39.241
I'm just conscious
of the budget.

16:39.275 --> 16:41.793
- And, you know, if we...
- Fuck the budget.

16:41.827 --> 16:45.862
- [Jo] Life's about budgeting.
- [Sam] I just want to have a decent time.

16:45.896 --> 16:47.482
Okay, well, let's do it.

16:47.517 --> 16:50.206
[Sam] I feel like that's what
we're not doing enough of.

16:50.241 --> 16:51.561
I just need you
to enjoy yourself.

16:52.896 --> 16:54.862
[Jo] I will try and
chill out a bit more.

16:55.482 --> 16:56.965
So you get a taxi,

16:57.000 --> 17:00.172
and then I'm gonna go off
and just get me some food.

17:00.206 --> 17:01.931
[Instrumental
guitar music playing]

17:01.965 --> 17:04.413
[Jo speaking Spanish]

17:04.448 --> 17:07.000
Okay, I'll take.

17:07.034 --> 17:10.034
[Jo] I'll see you back at the
hotel. Go and enjoy La Paz.

17:10.068 --> 17:11.310
[Sam] I'll try.

17:11.344 --> 17:13.689
[Narrator] With eight hours
until their bus connection,

17:13.724 --> 17:15.620
for the first time in the race,

17:15.655 --> 17:17.344
Sam's going solo,

17:19.275 --> 17:21.827
oh, my god. I'm on my own.

17:21.862 --> 17:24.586
In possession of
100 bolivianos...

17:24.620 --> 17:27.448
She said only
spend 50. Yeah, right.

17:27.482 --> 17:29.379
Just over ten pounds.

17:29.413 --> 17:31.862
I didn't even tell him
where the bloody hotel was.

17:31.896 --> 17:34.000
He doesn't really
listen or take things in,

17:34.034 --> 17:36.793
so he probably hasn't a
clue where we're staying.

17:38.413 --> 17:39.413
Can you feel that?

17:41.275 --> 17:42.275
No pressure.

17:44.862 --> 17:45.862
I want big food.

17:47.793 --> 17:52.000
I think, personally, there's a
main street and tall buildings.

17:52.034 --> 17:55.655
So therefore, restaurants.
That's my logic.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.724
This place is amazing.

18:00.758 --> 18:02.827
[Sam] I actually finally
got some time on my own.

18:02.862 --> 18:04.344
It's a bit less
stressed in a away,

18:04.379 --> 18:06.000
and that's why
I'm kind of like...

18:07.137 --> 18:08.137
Whee.

18:10.103 --> 18:12.793
[Sam] My mum just
wants to get there.

18:12.827 --> 18:14.034
Let's go to a restaurant.

18:15.103 --> 18:17.241
But straight off
of another bus...

18:17.275 --> 18:18.379
Smells amazing in there.

18:19.689 --> 18:23.517
I'm fancying something a
bit more pricey. [Laughs]

18:23.551 --> 18:26.068
Personally, I want to
go do some cool stuff.

18:33.310 --> 18:35.241
[Sam] Hola. Do you have a menu?

18:35.275 --> 18:38.586
- Sí?
- Uh, I could have the chocolate?

18:38.620 --> 18:40.862
- [Woman speaking Spanish]
- Yeah. Sí.

18:40.896 --> 18:42.379
[Sam] Caesar
salad, for starters,

18:43.034 --> 18:45.103
lasagna for seconds,

18:45.137 --> 18:46.620
spaghetti bolognese for thirds.

18:46.655 --> 18:48.000
Muchas gracias.

18:50.034 --> 18:52.275
[Sam] I might
get a cake as well.

18:52.310 --> 18:53.379
Gracias.

18:53.862 --> 18:55.275
[Slurps noisily]

19:01.931 --> 19:04.482
Now I'm worried
about Sam. [Chuckles]

19:04.517 --> 19:06.689
Should have written
down the hotel.

19:10.275 --> 19:11.793
[Sighs wearily]

19:11.827 --> 19:13.448
[Jo] I've been fine up till now.

19:13.482 --> 19:15.172
It's just hit me
today. [Sniffles]

19:15.206 --> 19:18.413
I think the frustration
of the buses yesterday

19:18.448 --> 19:21.068
and then the
knock-on effect of that

19:21.103 --> 19:24.068
means an extra
kind of two nights

19:24.103 --> 19:27.068
that we could have done
without, and I was thinking,

19:27.103 --> 19:29.793
again, to keep him going.

19:29.827 --> 19:33.413
Yeah, so it's all
piling up a little bit.

19:33.448 --> 19:36.758
But I think a few hours
sleep might just do me good.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.310
[Jen] Let's get through Bolivia,

19:40.344 --> 19:43.896
then I'll allow myself to
relax and enjoy Argentina.

19:43.931 --> 19:45.724
[Narrator] Also in La Paz...

19:45.758 --> 19:48.586
- Okay, uyuni or salta?
- Ideally, salta.

19:48.620 --> 19:50.137
Yeah, defo.

19:50.172 --> 19:52.413
Jen and Rob are
trying to book a bus

19:52.448 --> 19:55.655
non-stop out of Bolivia
to avoid the delays

19:55.689 --> 19:57.620
the nation-wide
election will bring.

19:57.655 --> 19:58.896
- [Jen] Hola.
- [Rob] Hola.

19:58.931 --> 20:01.000
- [Rob] Salta, Argentina? No.
- [Jen] Salta?

20:01.034 --> 20:02.413
- [Woman] Sí.
- [Man] No, no.

20:02.448 --> 20:05.241
[Jen] Today's our second
day of three days to get out.

20:05.275 --> 20:06.689
Uh, salta?

20:06.724 --> 20:07.862
- No.
- No? Gracias.

20:07.896 --> 20:09.862
[Jen] So if we can
get out by tomorrow,

20:09.896 --> 20:12.137
we're cutting it fine but
at least we've done it.

20:12.172 --> 20:15.103
This is just a waste of time.

20:15.137 --> 20:18.034
Let's let's do the last remaining
ones that we haven't done yet.

20:18.068 --> 20:20.034
And then we know
what the best options are.

20:21.724 --> 20:24.482
I think Rob and I
are very different.

20:24.517 --> 20:27.103
We've done all of these.

20:27.137 --> 20:30.000
I'm kind of slow and methodical.

20:30.034 --> 20:31.655
This one we wanted today.

20:31.689 --> 20:33.586
Yeah, but then
there's no one there.

20:33.620 --> 20:37.448
Whereas I am absolutely
spontaneous and like "now, now, now."

20:37.482 --> 20:38.827
[Sighs]

20:38.862 --> 20:42.275
Rob's qualities are
his worst and his best.

20:42.310 --> 20:44.241
All the planning,
all the research,

20:44.275 --> 20:45.896
you know, it's fantastic.

20:45.931 --> 20:48.620
But sometimes I just
want things done now.

20:48.655 --> 20:51.655
The frustration is, like, he
wants to gather more data,

20:51.689 --> 20:53.827
but, I mean, we've
done data gathering,

20:53.862 --> 20:56.448
and it's enough for me to
make a decision. [Sighs]

20:58.724 --> 21:00.310
I don't know.

21:00.344 --> 21:04.068
[Rob] I can't get information with
you stood still. You've got to follow me.

21:04.103 --> 21:05.424
- Pardon?
- You've got to follow me.

21:05.448 --> 21:07.182
I could get information
with you stood still.

21:07.206 --> 21:08.389
Why can't you get
the information?

21:08.413 --> 21:09.896
Why do I have to be there?

21:10.586 --> 21:12.620
- Ola. Salta?
- Jen?

21:12.655 --> 21:13.758
- Thank you.
- Jen?

21:13.793 --> 21:15.044
- What?
- This way. Come this way.

21:15.068 --> 21:16.551
Why am I following you?

21:16.586 --> 21:18.620
You're just taking
a pick out of me.

21:18.655 --> 21:21.517
Just follow you
around like a wench.

21:21.551 --> 21:25.068
[Rob] I'm trying to crack on and
you're standing there doing nothing.

21:26.103 --> 21:29.586
Fuck off! Fuck off
right now! Fuck off!

21:29.620 --> 21:33.517
Standing there doing nothing?
Fuck you! I'm done with you.

21:34.965 --> 21:36.827
Get me outside. I
need some fresh air.

21:40.793 --> 21:43.586
- You all right, Jen.
- No, no, okay?

21:43.620 --> 21:47.172
I'm upset because you
said, "come with me now

21:47.206 --> 21:49.379
because you're just
standing there doing nothing."

21:49.413 --> 21:51.000
[Rob] That's not what I meant.

21:51.034 --> 21:53.413
Well, then you need to think
about how you say things.

21:53.448 --> 21:56.000
'Cause you say things to
me, and it really upsets me.

21:56.034 --> 21:58.310
And you don't care how
you make me feel. [Sniffles]

21:58.344 --> 22:00.379
- No, I do you care how I make you feel.
- Clearly.

22:07.793 --> 22:10.103
Sam was supposed to
be here half an hour ago.

22:10.137 --> 22:13.793
And I stupidly left him and didn't
give him the name of the hotel.

22:15.068 --> 22:16.448
[Sam] Gracias.

22:19.896 --> 22:26.310
So, you know inca's...
Inca... inca's hotel?

22:27.068 --> 22:28.793
[Speaking in foreign language]

22:28.827 --> 22:30.068
Pardon?

22:31.413 --> 22:34.655
Uh, no. Never mind.

22:34.689 --> 22:37.206
Probably best to just
walk back up where I was,

22:37.241 --> 22:39.896
and see if I can remember
where I came from.

22:39.931 --> 22:41.896
[Narrator] With an hour
till their bus departs...

22:41.931 --> 22:43.241
Time to get lost. [Chuckles]

22:43.275 --> 22:44.931
Sam must navigate a city

22:44.965 --> 22:48.827
four times the size of his
hometown, Manchester.

22:48.862 --> 22:52.068
It's just difficult to know
what his next move would be.

22:53.689 --> 22:57.413
[Sam] So this is where I
think I came down, up across.

22:58.068 --> 22:59.862
Hey, there's a bus pulling up.

23:01.793 --> 23:04.620
I hope mum gets my mental
message to come to the bus station.

23:07.137 --> 23:10.137
[Exhales] That is amazing.

23:10.172 --> 23:11.586
I found my way
to the bus station.

23:11.620 --> 23:14.758
Got no Google maps.
Got no mum. Got nothing.

23:14.793 --> 23:16.793
Did go one direction wrong!

23:17.655 --> 23:19.379
Come on, mum, I believe in you.

23:21.482 --> 23:24.689
Mum! Mum!

23:27.310 --> 23:28.310
Come on, mum.

23:30.724 --> 23:32.310
Sam?

23:32.896 --> 23:34.137
[Sam laughs]

23:34.172 --> 23:38.103
- I knew you'd get my logic.
- Exactly.

23:38.137 --> 23:39.724
Well, I just thought,

23:39.758 --> 23:41.803
"I didn't give him the name of the
hotel. There's no way he's gonna find it."

23:41.827 --> 23:45.206
I telepathically sent you a
message to come here, so...

23:45.241 --> 23:47.103
Did you find somewhere
nice for breakfast?

23:47.137 --> 23:50.379
- Yeah, had to walk a few injured miles.
- Yeah.

23:50.413 --> 23:54.551
It was a brilliant little tour, like,
some tours are the best tours.

23:54.586 --> 23:56.655
[Jo laughs] Yeah. Brilliant.

23:58.931 --> 24:02.068
- [Jamiul] You ready to take a few steps on the moon?
- [Emon] Yep.

24:02.103 --> 24:05.103
[Narrator] With a few hours
to kill until the night bus,

24:05.137 --> 24:08.379
emon and jamiul have
reached the valle De la Luna,

24:08.413 --> 24:11.448
12 kilometers outside of La Paz.

24:11.482 --> 24:13.482
Lovely, lovely.

24:13.517 --> 24:16.172
Not actually a
valley, but a labyrinth

24:16.206 --> 24:18.965
of eroded sandstone
and Clay pinnacles

24:19.000 --> 24:21.517
that acquired its name
after Neil Armstrong

24:21.551 --> 24:25.379
likened the bizarre formations
to the landscape of the moon.

24:25.413 --> 24:27.827
The moon walk on
the moon. [Laughs]

24:29.655 --> 24:31.000
But it looks pretty darn good.

24:31.655 --> 24:35.103
Yes! Come on!

24:35.137 --> 24:37.689
[Jamiul] The experiences
that we're having like today

24:37.724 --> 24:39.689
are bringing us closer together.

24:39.724 --> 24:41.413
I'll say, "conquered the moon."

24:41.448 --> 24:45.689
They're allowing us to sort of know
each other on a very personal basis

24:45.724 --> 24:48.448
'cause we're
together all the time.

24:48.482 --> 24:51.206
I guess, um, for me
right now, it's hard

24:51.241 --> 24:52.758
because I don't
wanna disrespect him,

24:52.793 --> 24:55.206
and I don't want to put him
in an uncomfortable position.

24:55.241 --> 24:58.793
But for things to progress
in our relationship,

24:58.827 --> 25:01.586
I need answers for questions
I've had for a very long time.

25:03.724 --> 25:06.620
- This is probably where Neil Armstrong had lunch.
- [Jamiul laughs]

25:07.965 --> 25:10.896
-This is a cool place. I'm glad you chose this place.
-Yeah.

25:11.586 --> 25:13.310
You can't miss this.

25:13.344 --> 25:15.896
[Emon] I feel that this race
has brought us closer together.

25:15.931 --> 25:18.482
Yeah. Yeah, man.

25:18.517 --> 25:21.241
You know what, one thing I wanted
to ask you for a very long time.

25:21.275 --> 25:25.448
Do you get any of the decisions
that you made back in the day,

25:25.482 --> 25:30.034
in terms of why is it exactly
that you left the family?

25:31.827 --> 25:34.034
Uh, it's a tough
question, to be fair.

25:35.827 --> 25:37.724
[Jamiul] Every time
I've asked about

25:37.758 --> 25:40.965
what's happened to
him or where he is, um,

25:41.000 --> 25:43.413
if I've asked my
mom or my family,

25:43.448 --> 25:45.310
they've kind of just
brushed it off to the side.

25:46.517 --> 25:49.655
After asking so many
times, you just kind of know,

25:49.689 --> 25:51.931
"you know what, nobody
wants to answer your questions."

25:53.068 --> 25:55.379
If I didn't leave
Manchester when I did,

25:55.413 --> 25:57.206
I wouldn't have been
able to spread my wings.

25:57.241 --> 25:58.896
It's literally that.

25:58.931 --> 26:01.827
It sounds cliche, but
it is literally that, okay?

26:01.862 --> 26:04.655
After finishing
university my dad was set

26:04.689 --> 26:07.586
that I should settle
down and get married.

26:07.620 --> 26:09.931
But about 15 years ago,
you get married to a person

26:09.965 --> 26:13.620
that your mom, dad set.
That was the bengali culture.

26:13.655 --> 26:15.137
- Yeah.
- That was the way it was.

26:15.172 --> 26:17.655
And, my dad did
have someone in mind,

26:19.689 --> 26:21.724
but I didn't see
that as my future.

26:21.758 --> 26:23.931
Because I was being
selfish at the time.

26:23.965 --> 26:25.482
But at the end of the day,

26:26.310 --> 26:27.413
it was my life.

26:28.034 --> 26:30.379
That wasn't for me.

26:30.413 --> 26:32.827
I'd already chosen someone
that I wanted to marry.

26:32.862 --> 26:35.655
My parents weren't too
happy about that choice.

26:35.689 --> 26:37.862
But I just knew inside
that she was the one.

26:39.241 --> 26:40.379
- Laz?
- Yeah.

26:40.413 --> 26:43.620
Do you know where the
jumpers are? They're missing.

26:43.655 --> 26:45.724
Are they not in your drawer?

26:45.758 --> 26:47.655
- I'm not sure.
- I think they might be here.

26:47.689 --> 26:49.724
[Emon] We've been together
for about ten years now.

26:49.758 --> 26:51.827
I'll be honest with you, I
am gonna miss her a lot.

26:51.862 --> 26:54.137
Are you not gonna take
anything to remember me by?

26:54.172 --> 26:56.344
I'll have our wedding
ring with me, so, yeah.

26:56.379 --> 26:59.068
Well, that's all I need,
is the wedding ring.

26:59.103 --> 27:01.793
I guess everything
happens for a reason in life.

27:01.827 --> 27:04.655
And I've ended up
with an amazing wife.

27:04.689 --> 27:07.275
And now I'm back in touch
with dad's side of the family.

27:07.310 --> 27:09.068
I'm doing this trip with jamiul.

27:09.103 --> 27:12.586
So, yeah, we got a
lot of catching up to do.

27:13.689 --> 27:14.931
That's what it came down to.

27:16.344 --> 27:19.758
Either I choose the easy
option, staying with the family,

27:19.793 --> 27:22.275
and doing what my
dad told me to do.

27:22.310 --> 27:23.724
Or I do my own thing.

27:25.137 --> 27:27.896
I chose love over the family.

27:27.931 --> 27:31.620
I'd say I'm similar to you in that
position, innit? I don't think it's for me.

27:31.655 --> 27:33.562
End of the day, you need
someone to break them boundaries.

27:33.586 --> 27:36.482
And just, unfortunately, had
to be myself for the family.

27:36.517 --> 27:38.586
You broke some
boundaries for me, yeah.

27:38.620 --> 27:41.034
And I understand.
Give me a bro hug.

27:41.068 --> 27:43.965
[Both grunt]

27:44.000 --> 27:47.413
-[Jamiul] I've missed you, man.
-I've missed it.

27:47.448 --> 27:50.896
Go on then, another night bus.

27:54.413 --> 27:56.517
[Narrator] With the
Bolivian elections eminent,

27:56.551 --> 27:59.827
three teams are on the
move, leaving La Paz,

27:59.862 --> 28:02.586
and traveling south
overnight towards the uyuni.

28:05.344 --> 28:08.206
- [Jen] What a weird day, isn't it?
- [Rob] Yeah.

28:08.241 --> 28:09.551
Been a shame, really.

28:09.586 --> 28:11.172
[Jen] What's happened
has happened.

28:11.206 --> 28:13.931
Let's just draw a line. Let's
just move on. We're a team.

28:13.965 --> 28:15.655
So we'll get through
it because we have to.

28:16.931 --> 28:19.206
[Jamiul] I'm glad to
finally get some clarity

28:19.241 --> 28:20.655
on what actually happened.

28:20.689 --> 28:23.620
Throughout my life, I haven't
been able to get that clarity.

28:23.655 --> 28:25.517
I'm gonna remember this.

28:25.551 --> 28:28.275
It's going to be a
defining moment

28:28.310 --> 28:30.586
in both of our lives, I think.

28:30.620 --> 28:33.137
[Narrator] 264
kilometers to the north,

28:33.172 --> 28:35.551
still at the fourth
checkpoint in Peru,

28:36.551 --> 28:38.793
dom and Lizzie.

28:38.827 --> 28:42.586
Leaving puno 35 hours
after the other teams.

28:42.620 --> 28:43.862
[Lizzie] Muchas gracias.

28:43.896 --> 28:46.241
I didn't really realize
that anything was wrong

28:46.275 --> 28:50.758
till probably I was getting
wheelchaired into hospital.

28:50.793 --> 28:53.275
And then I knew,
obviously, I'd had a seizure.

28:55.034 --> 28:56.344
I've got the all clear, then.

28:56.379 --> 28:58.517
Yeah, we'll carry
on with the race.

28:58.551 --> 29:00.862
- I hope there's not too soon.
- No.

29:00.896 --> 29:02.724
I feel a lot better now.

29:02.758 --> 29:05.517
Maybe for a few days
I'll be of taking control

29:05.551 --> 29:07.586
of the situation, that
should be different.

29:07.620 --> 29:09.551
But I think it'll good for me.

29:09.586 --> 29:12.241
[Dom] I don't want last
night's events to be the reason

29:12.275 --> 29:15.448
why we're not coming
in third, second or first.

29:15.482 --> 29:18.655
I want us to be in
control of our own race,

29:18.689 --> 29:21.827
and I think, if anything,
it's spurred me on more.

29:21.862 --> 29:24.793
- Bloody hell, this rain is ridiculous.
- Oh, my god!

29:24.827 --> 29:27.275
It just seems we bring
Yorkshire weather with us

29:27.310 --> 29:29.103
everywhere we bloody go.

29:29.137 --> 29:30.965
[Narrator] In a bid to catch up,

29:31.000 --> 29:34.068
the siblings are aiming to
bus hop straight through Chile.

29:34.103 --> 29:36.137
[Lizzie] I think you
need the bad moment

29:36.172 --> 29:38.034
to realize how much you
appreciate each other,

29:38.068 --> 29:41.655
and that's something
that'll probably strengthen us

29:41.689 --> 29:43.344
both here and at home.

29:52.862 --> 29:54.137
[Narrator] The uyuni,

29:54.172 --> 29:56.931
home to one of South
America's few rail networks.

29:56.965 --> 29:58.482
[Sam] That is incredible.

29:58.517 --> 30:01.137
[Narrator] On the outskirts
lies a collection of over 100

30:01.172 --> 30:03.448
abandoned British
steam train carriages.

30:03.482 --> 30:06.000
All aboard!
[Imitates train horn]

30:06.034 --> 30:08.448
[Narrator] Imported in
the early 20th century,

30:08.482 --> 30:10.896
but discarded in the 1940s

30:10.931 --> 30:14.103
after a steep decline in
Bolivia's mineral mining industry.

30:17.517 --> 30:19.172
- [Sam] Salt plains?
- [Jo] Yep.

30:22.379 --> 30:24.103
[Narrator] Uyuni is also home

30:24.137 --> 30:26.310
to the world's
largest salt flats.

30:26.344 --> 30:27.482
[Jo] Wow!

30:27.517 --> 30:29.689
- [Sam] This is salt?
- [Driver] Yes, that's salt.

30:30.586 --> 30:32.620
- [Sam] You sure?
- [Driver] Yes, yes.

30:32.655 --> 30:34.000
[Jo laughs]

30:34.034 --> 30:36.344
[Narrator] Created
over 40,000 years ago

30:36.379 --> 30:39.448
from the drying
out of several lakes.

30:39.482 --> 30:43.620
At points, the salt
crust is ten meters thick.

30:43.655 --> 30:45.620
The flats are
visible from space,

30:45.655 --> 30:48.068
and are so vast and white,

30:48.103 --> 30:50.689
NASA uses them to
calibrate the satellites.

30:56.413 --> 30:57.724
Stop!

30:59.931 --> 31:01.000
[Grunts]

31:04.896 --> 31:06.206
[Imitates farting]

31:07.103 --> 31:08.448
[Laughs]

31:10.551 --> 31:14.827
[Narrator] At the heart of
the salt flats, Isla incahuasi,

31:14.862 --> 31:17.655
the tip of an ancient
volcano that provided respite

31:17.689 --> 31:22.103
for incans and their llamas as
they cross the inhospitable terrain.

31:22.137 --> 31:24.103
[Sam] You said these
grow one centimeter a year.

31:24.137 --> 31:26.448
- Yes.
- How many years old do you reckon that is?

31:26.482 --> 31:30.310
- 500 years old.
- [Sam] That is ridiculous.

31:30.344 --> 31:32.344
That cactus there has
got to be over ten meters.

31:32.379 --> 31:33.758
That's about a
thousand years old.

31:33.793 --> 31:36.103
- Yes.
- [Jo] My goodness.

31:37.896 --> 31:42.586
Yesterday I had a bit of a,
sort of emotional meltdown.

31:42.620 --> 31:46.379
Sam was sweet and he was just,
you know, saying from his perspective,

31:46.413 --> 31:48.931
I needed to chill a little bit,

31:48.965 --> 31:50.793
and try and enjoy things more.

31:51.448 --> 31:54.241
Oh, my goodness.

31:54.275 --> 31:56.000
[Sam] That is incredible.

32:01.931 --> 32:03.206
Speechless.

32:04.586 --> 32:06.103
[Jo] It's just incredible.

32:06.137 --> 32:07.724
I didn't expect
this that is for sure.

32:10.448 --> 32:12.068
[Jo] I think it's very special

32:12.103 --> 32:15.137
when your own child can
advise you and support you.

32:15.172 --> 32:17.689
Obviously, it shows
he's growing up.

32:17.724 --> 32:21.793
So I think I need to
heed what he was saying.

32:21.827 --> 32:24.275
- I'm so pleased we came here.
- Yeah, I know, definitely.

32:24.310 --> 32:27.862
- [Jo] God. Incredible.
- Beautiful.

32:27.896 --> 32:30.551
This salt flats is,
like, on my bucket list.

32:30.586 --> 32:33.241
Something I never thought
I'd ever see in my life.

32:33.275 --> 32:36.448
Possibly one of the coolest
places in South America.

32:40.551 --> 32:44.241
- They're like massive penises, mom.
- [Jo laughs] Yes, darling.

32:46.275 --> 32:47.862
[Lizzie] Thank you. Gracias.

32:47.896 --> 32:51.551
[Narrator] Finally crossing the
border into Chile, dom and Lizzie.

32:51.586 --> 32:53.724
[Lizzie] We need to find
a bus to calama asap.

32:53.758 --> 32:55.620
And we need money as well.

32:55.655 --> 32:57.482
[Narrator] Determined
to make up time,

32:57.517 --> 33:00.379
Lizzie's looking for the
fastest transport south.

33:01.758 --> 33:03.896
Ola. Uh, kalama?

33:03.931 --> 33:06.103
We just booked a
bus ticket to calama,

33:06.137 --> 33:08.413
which leads into
the atacama desert.

33:08.448 --> 33:10.310
So I'm bursting to
see what it looks like.

33:10.344 --> 33:12.310
All right, let's keep
going. Keep going, dom.

33:12.344 --> 33:14.620
I tend to take the driver's seat

33:14.655 --> 33:17.551
because that's
always been the case.

33:17.586 --> 33:19.482
I still need to
recover and rest.

33:19.517 --> 33:22.206
And after everything
that's happened,

33:22.241 --> 33:24.620
it's nice to see that she's
taking control of this race.

33:27.517 --> 33:29.586
I definitely feel a lot
more confident in myself,

33:29.620 --> 33:31.241
like, I can choose
wherever we go next

33:31.275 --> 33:33.827
without making too
much of a mistake.

33:33.862 --> 33:35.724
'Cause I do understand
how this race works,

33:35.758 --> 33:37.172
and I have watched
how you do it.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.344
[Dom] I know.

33:39.379 --> 33:41.700
Might be quite nice to me,
just to sit back and chill for a bit.

33:41.724 --> 33:43.896
Yeah. We need to.

33:47.517 --> 33:49.103
[Narrator] Last to leave uyuni,

33:49.137 --> 33:52.551
Jo and Sam have
opted to travel in style.

33:52.586 --> 33:53.965
[Both imitating train horn]

33:54.000 --> 33:56.758
[Narrator] An overnight train
to the border town of villazon,

33:56.793 --> 33:58.896
286 kilometers away.

33:59.448 --> 34:00.689
First train.

34:00.724 --> 34:03.044
- Go on, go ahead and sit on one of 'em train.
- [Jo laughs]

34:03.724 --> 34:05.034
[Train horn honks]

34:06.620 --> 34:08.344
[Sam] Are you
kidding? I can't do it.

34:11.413 --> 34:14.344
This is the size of half
the buses we've been on.

34:14.379 --> 34:16.413
The way it's wobbling
and the speed it's going,

34:16.448 --> 34:20.241
I think it might take us to the end
of the race to get there. [Laughs]

34:20.275 --> 34:23.655
I have to say, we are
possibly going walking speed.

34:23.689 --> 34:25.896
[Jo laughs]

34:25.931 --> 34:28.172
[Narrator] With Jo and Sam
on their way to Argentina,

34:31.758 --> 34:34.896
two teams have crossed
the border, neck and neck.

34:34.931 --> 34:37.620
Argentina is where
our final checkpoint is.

34:37.655 --> 34:40.448
So we're actually knocking
on the door, aren't we?

34:40.482 --> 34:43.482
I am really looking forward
to Argentina. Why is that?

34:43.517 --> 34:46.241
[In sing-song voice]
Someone likes their wine.

34:46.275 --> 34:48.068
[In sing-song voice] Wine time.

34:48.103 --> 34:50.586
[Narrator] Stretching
from the tropic of capricorn

34:50.620 --> 34:52.482
towards the tip of Antarctica.

34:52.517 --> 34:56.000
Argentina boasts wildly
different landscapes,

34:56.034 --> 34:58.620
with rain forests and
waterfalls in the north,

34:58.655 --> 35:01.310
to mountains and
glaciers in the south.

35:02.655 --> 35:04.068
Uniting the country,

35:04.103 --> 35:07.793
its love for wine,
and the tango.

35:07.827 --> 35:09.724
We need to look for some work

35:09.758 --> 35:12.310
because we need
a bit of money, man.

35:13.758 --> 35:16.172
[Narrator] With just the thought
of their budget remaining,

35:16.206 --> 35:19.586
emon and jamiul are once
again braving high altitude.

35:20.896 --> 35:23.172
This time in the
search for work.

35:25.206 --> 35:27.310
[Jamiul] Now this is epic.

35:28.827 --> 35:34.413
[Narrator] 4,500 meters above
sea level, the salinas grandes.

35:34.448 --> 35:37.310
Not as extensive as
the salt flats in Bolivia,

35:37.344 --> 35:40.000
but still the third
largest in the world.

35:40.034 --> 35:43.034
Their distinctive turquoise
pools setting them apart.

35:45.827 --> 35:47.517
- Ola.
- Ola.

35:47.551 --> 35:48.620
[Man speaking in Spanish]

35:50.551 --> 35:52.896
Walter. Walter, jamiul.

35:52.931 --> 35:54.655
[Narrator] Local
indigenous communities

35:54.689 --> 35:56.689
mine the area for salt

35:56.724 --> 35:58.310
using the same techniques

35:58.344 --> 36:01.068
Walter's ancestors
have used for centuries.

36:04.310 --> 36:05.793
Uh-huh.

36:13.344 --> 36:14.344
[Emon] It's too hard.

36:14.965 --> 36:15.965
Ah, okay.

36:17.517 --> 36:18.517
All right.

36:22.137 --> 36:23.620
Oh, okay.

36:27.931 --> 36:31.310
[Emon] It's very hard work, but
I'm also concerned about the budget.

36:31.344 --> 36:33.724
This job will just take
the heat off us a little bit.

36:34.310 --> 36:35.827
[Grunts]

36:41.172 --> 36:43.310
We should get that
left bicep, yeah. [Grunts]

36:46.413 --> 36:48.655
We didn't have to do
this back in england.

36:48.689 --> 36:49.655
Hell no.

36:49.689 --> 36:51.000
[Exhales]

36:51.034 --> 36:52.931
[Emon] How is your asthma, dude?

36:52.965 --> 36:55.103
[Panting] I am still good.

36:55.137 --> 36:57.586
Just take it easy.
Slowly does it.

36:57.620 --> 37:02.206
Come on, you son of a gun.
I've got you. Stop teasing me.

37:02.241 --> 37:03.931
[Emon] I think jamiul
is the kind of person

37:03.965 --> 37:05.586
that he doesn't wanna
let the team down,

37:05.620 --> 37:07.275
even if he's struggling.

37:07.310 --> 37:09.206
He doesn't like to
leave a job half done.

37:09.241 --> 37:12.620
[Panting] These mans
are on another level.

37:12.655 --> 37:13.862
Oh, it's tough. It's tough.

37:13.896 --> 37:15.482
I rate these guys, what they do.

37:16.931 --> 37:18.275
I'm really impressed.

37:18.310 --> 37:20.241
My uncle did a
bit of work today.

37:20.275 --> 37:21.517
Did better than I did.

37:21.551 --> 37:23.172
[Sighs]

37:23.206 --> 37:26.241
It's much nicer to do
things like this now.

37:26.275 --> 37:29.172
There isn't this thing in
the back of our minds.

37:29.206 --> 37:31.517
Probably be myself a bit more.

37:31.551 --> 37:34.103
Own goal, there. Own goal.

37:35.551 --> 37:37.517
I'm better now. Thank you.

37:37.551 --> 37:40.000
I'm sorry. I'm much better.

37:41.793 --> 37:43.793
Oh. Gracias.

37:45.896 --> 37:48.620
Hopefully, now we can make a
straight shoot for the checkpoint.

37:49.655 --> 37:51.379
Get there as soon as possible.

37:51.413 --> 37:53.931
[Sighs] Hard day's graft.

37:54.724 --> 37:55.862
Back in the race.

37:57.655 --> 37:59.758
[Narrator] Emon and
jamiul are speeding south

37:59.793 --> 38:02.206
from the salt
flats towards salta,

38:02.241 --> 38:05.586
the nearest major transport
hub to the checkpoint,

38:05.620 --> 38:07.586
219 kilometers away.

38:08.896 --> 38:11.896
Nearly arrived in
Argentina, Jo and Sam.

38:11.931 --> 38:14.931
[Jo] I think picking
our stops is important.

38:14.965 --> 38:16.862
And if we just make sure

38:16.896 --> 38:20.379
that they're going to be
really something special,

38:20.413 --> 38:22.689
then hopefully Sam
will want to keep going.

38:23.931 --> 38:27.275
[Sam] I quite like
this. Bit different.

38:27.310 --> 38:31.000
[Narrator] Heading into the
quebrada De humahuaca valley,

38:31.034 --> 38:35.034
they're answering an ad in the
jobs directory for help in a farm.

38:35.068 --> 38:36.517
[Sam] Where the hell are we?

38:37.896 --> 38:40.413
[Speaking in foreign language]

39:00.620 --> 39:02.241
[Narrator] Hector
and clarita's family

39:02.275 --> 39:04.275
have lived here
for four generations.

39:05.551 --> 39:07.344
Whoa, who's a good boy?

39:07.379 --> 39:09.689
[Narrator] Living a
back to basics life

39:09.724 --> 39:12.896
with no Internet or
phone, drinking rainwater,

39:12.931 --> 39:16.000
and subsisting off their land.

39:16.034 --> 39:19.655
It's actually really nice to
finally feel like I'm back at work.

39:19.689 --> 39:22.586
- Finally burn some energy.
- [Jo] Great.

39:22.620 --> 39:24.689
[Narrator] As well as
growing their own vegetables,

39:24.724 --> 39:27.206
Hector breeds goats
to make cheese.

39:27.241 --> 39:28.379
[Goats bleating]

39:29.551 --> 39:31.137
[Jo] Yeah, I think
we take him down.

39:31.172 --> 39:34.068
- Come on, little one.
- [Sam laughs]

39:34.896 --> 39:37.241
That was insane. There you go.

39:37.275 --> 39:38.724
- Oh, look at this.
- Yeah.

39:38.758 --> 39:39.931
Incredible.

39:40.965 --> 39:43.068
Never thought I'd
be goat herding.

39:46.965 --> 39:50.448
It's really cool. Like, I never
thought I'd ever be doing this.

39:50.482 --> 39:53.034
Like, following a bunch
of goats with a farmer

39:53.068 --> 39:55.000
whose family has been
here for four generations.

39:55.034 --> 39:57.379
And, like, to have been
invited into their home

39:57.413 --> 39:59.896
to work with them, it's
quite an honor to be honest.

40:02.034 --> 40:05.413
Something I can tick off the
list that I didn't know I had.

40:05.448 --> 40:06.655
[Laughs]

40:12.896 --> 40:15.724
[Narrator] 285
kilometers to the west.

40:15.758 --> 40:18.689
I think we've arrived into
the atacama desert now,

40:18.724 --> 40:21.586
and it looks incredible
from what we can see.

40:21.620 --> 40:24.137
We've had a relentless few days,

40:24.172 --> 40:25.862
and I think we
need to just stop.

40:25.896 --> 40:27.413
So I think we're
gonna stop. [Laughs]

40:28.586 --> 40:30.310
[Narrator] A
thousand-kilometers-long,

40:30.344 --> 40:33.241
stretching from southern
Peru through northern Chile,

40:33.275 --> 40:35.172
the atacama desert.

40:35.206 --> 40:39.000
Outside of Antarctica,
the driest place on earth.

40:39.034 --> 40:43.310
Some parts receiving less than
one millimeter of rainfall per year.

40:43.344 --> 40:46.310
It's a varied landscape
of bubbling geysers,

40:46.344 --> 40:48.413
cinematic rock formations

40:48.448 --> 40:51.448
and crystal clear blue lagoons.

40:51.482 --> 40:55.137
Having raced over a thousand
kilometers on back to back buses,

40:55.172 --> 40:59.344
dom and Lizzie have reached
the town of San Pedro De atacama.

40:59.379 --> 41:03.241
[Dom] I think we have a chance
to sort of let our hair down a bit,

41:03.275 --> 41:06.206
and not just experience the things,
but we need to recover as well.

41:06.241 --> 41:09.517
So, let's get to the checkpoint
tomorrow rather than tonight.

41:09.551 --> 41:10.862
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

41:10.896 --> 41:13.620
Shall we ask about prices and
then think about booking a bus?

41:13.655 --> 41:16.448
- I think it'll be good to get it booked.
- Okay.

41:16.482 --> 41:18.103
- Ola.
- [Woman] Ola.

41:18.137 --> 41:20.275
We're trying to go to salta.

41:21.862 --> 41:23.241
[Speaking foreign language]

41:25.206 --> 41:26.655
- It's full.
- [Woman] Full.

41:26.689 --> 41:29.448
Oh. Is there any other...

41:33.931 --> 41:37.172
- We can't stay for two days.
- Yeah, it's full.

41:37.206 --> 41:38.620
[Sighs]

41:40.896 --> 41:44.827
So there's no way to get
to salta, so we're stuck

41:46.689 --> 41:47.793
- okay.
- Okay.

41:50.103 --> 41:52.896
Um... right.

41:52.931 --> 41:55.034
I don't know what we can do.

41:55.068 --> 41:57.448
We're so tired, the last
thing we needed to hear

41:57.482 --> 42:00.827
is that we were gonna
be stuck, still in the race,

42:00.862 --> 42:03.896
like, it's just...
It's soul crushing.

42:03.931 --> 42:05.724
Oh dear.

42:07.137 --> 42:09.413
Well, I think we
just need to rest first.

42:09.448 --> 42:11.586
- Okay?
- Yeah.

42:11.620 --> 42:14.758
[Dom] I never expected
us to be this far behind.

42:14.793 --> 42:17.172
I don't think we realized
how hard it was going to be.

42:19.241 --> 42:21.655
We really need a
miracle to get out of here.

42:21.689 --> 42:22.689
To get out of here

42:24.103 --> 42:26.758
[Lizzie sobs] This has
been the worst leg yet, by far.

42:29.862 --> 42:32.379
[John] Meanwhile,
in northern Argentina,

42:32.413 --> 42:35.931
Jo and Sam are staying put
with Hector's family in hornaditas

42:37.827 --> 42:41.172
emon and jamiul are
closing in on salta.

42:41.206 --> 42:44.551
Already there and in
striking distance of cafayate,

42:44.586 --> 42:45.931
Jen and Rob.

42:45.965 --> 42:47.285
[Jen] It is nice
though, isn't it?

42:49.379 --> 42:52.758
[John] With its striking
colonial architecture,

42:52.793 --> 42:56.724
the city has earned the
nickname, salta the beautiful.

42:56.758 --> 42:59.931
And celebrates a
rich cultural heritage.

42:59.965 --> 43:03.034
In the country's 1810
war of independence,

43:03.068 --> 43:05.724
gauchos weren't just
masterful horse riders.

43:05.758 --> 43:10.103
They were considered warriors, tasked
to help protect their local communities

43:10.137 --> 43:12.034
from the Spanish army.

43:12.068 --> 43:16.965
We need to get to our
next checkpoint, cafayate.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.344
[John] Having booked
themselves a bed for the night,

43:19.379 --> 43:22.931
Jen and Rob quiz
hostel manager, Diego.

43:22.965 --> 43:25.172
How far from here is that?

43:25.206 --> 43:27.620
- 190 kilometers.
- Wow, okay.

43:27.655 --> 43:32.034
Do you know how much a taxi
would cost for, like a journey like that?

43:32.862 --> 43:34.344
Mm-hmm.

43:34.379 --> 43:36.068
I was thinking to
take you in my car.

43:36.793 --> 43:38.034
- Really?
- Yes, maybe.

43:38.068 --> 43:39.320
[Jen] How much
would you charge us?

43:39.344 --> 43:41.551
Uh, no, just for fun.

43:41.586 --> 43:42.907
- [Jen] Just for fun?
- No, really?

43:42.931 --> 43:45.551
-Would you do that? Oh, my god.
-Amazing.

43:45.586 --> 43:48.965
[Diego] It's a nice trip to do it,
because the landscape is really nice.

43:49.000 --> 43:52.103
- Oh.
- I can't reach you in the phone, no?

43:52.137 --> 43:53.655
- No, no.
- No.

43:53.689 --> 43:55.931
- [Jen] We could just meet you here.
- In the morning?

43:55.965 --> 43:57.000
- So, nine?
- Great.

43:57.034 --> 43:58.275
Yeah. Yeah.

43:58.310 --> 44:00.827
Thank you so much.

44:02.137 --> 44:04.275
- [Rob] Wow.
- [Jen] That was so good.

44:04.310 --> 44:05.872
[Jen] I hated strangers,
didn't I, before?

44:05.896 --> 44:07.758
Restoring my faith in humanity.

44:11.310 --> 44:13.965
[John] With a free lift to
the checkpoint, planned,

44:14.000 --> 44:16.931
Jen and Rob can afford
to let their hair down.

44:16.965 --> 44:19.586
I'm ready to be entertained,
I'm hungry. Fancy a wine.

44:19.620 --> 44:22.034
We're just gonna
really enjoy ourselves.

44:23.000 --> 44:23.931
What's this?

44:23.965 --> 44:25.793
[Speaking Spanish]

44:25.827 --> 44:28.379
Oh, other... Other meat.
Just other meat, she said.

44:28.413 --> 44:30.310
- Other meat?
- Other meat.

44:30.344 --> 44:34.137
[John] With its reputation, as
the cradle of argentinian folk lore,

44:34.172 --> 44:38.103
salta celebrates its cultural
history in music and dance

44:38.137 --> 44:40.344
at the city's manypeñas,

44:40.379 --> 44:41.551
music venues.

44:43.620 --> 44:47.482
Where you can also try local
specialties such as empanadas,

44:47.517 --> 44:50.103
meat pasties and locro,

44:50.137 --> 44:52.137
a bean maize and meat stew.

44:53.448 --> 44:54.862
[Rob] Having a lovely time.

44:54.896 --> 44:56.275
We've been able to relax,

44:56.310 --> 44:58.137
we've been able
to enjoy ourselves.

44:58.172 --> 45:00.413
I've had fun and it's so
much easier to get along

45:00.448 --> 45:03.551
and communicate with each
other when we're all in good mood.

45:06.827 --> 45:08.827
I honestly had
such a lovely day.

45:08.862 --> 45:11.551
Feels a little bit to me
like a bit of a turning point.

45:13.034 --> 45:16.689
I don't know whether that's because
the fight we had was just so awful,

45:16.724 --> 45:18.827
but I feel like we've
really pulled it back

45:18.862 --> 45:21.896
and that... That was kind of, you
know, one and now we're at a 100.

45:21.931 --> 45:25.586
[Rob] I think we needed to do it
to get all of our frustrations out.

45:25.931 --> 45:27.000
And...

45:27.034 --> 45:31.000
Wow we have, it's kind
of a lot more relaxed.

45:31.034 --> 45:35.551
I get frustrated about not
being the person I used to be.

45:35.586 --> 45:37.620
But, perhaps I have
to create a new me.

45:40.931 --> 45:42.827
[Jen] I think he had a
really good time tonight.

45:42.862 --> 45:44.344
He's been dancing.

45:44.379 --> 45:47.482
It's really nice to see
Robbie enjoying himself

45:47.517 --> 45:52.068
and I always kind of think back to
the old Robbie and kind of, you know,

45:52.103 --> 45:54.931
want to see him,
kind of as he was.

45:54.965 --> 45:56.965
Actually, really,
that's quite mean

45:57.000 --> 46:00.103
and probably not very nice for
Robbie 'cause the old Robbie is gone.

46:00.137 --> 46:02.862
New Robbie, that's... I think
what we've got to look forward to.

46:05.241 --> 46:06.793
[Man speaking in Spanish]

46:09.827 --> 46:10.965
[Music continues]

46:17.344 --> 46:20.034
[Jen] We're hoping that
our hostel host gives us a lift

46:20.068 --> 46:21.655
to cafayate tomorrow.

46:21.689 --> 46:23.206
He said that he would.

46:23.241 --> 46:25.655
Only we've come home to sleep

46:25.689 --> 46:28.000
and he's gone on a bender.

46:30.172 --> 46:32.320
- So we're somewhat concerned.
- Well, he's still out, yeah.

46:32.344 --> 46:33.344
Hmm.

46:50.896 --> 46:52.275
[John] 5.00 am.

46:52.310 --> 46:54.551
Hornaditas.

46:54.586 --> 46:56.758
[Sam] Going to go
collect a bunch of wood,

46:56.793 --> 46:58.758
to warm the oven
up to make the bread.

47:02.000 --> 47:05.448
[Jo] I've never baked bread,
ever, so this could get messy.

47:07.655 --> 47:08.655
[Sam chuckling]

47:09.655 --> 47:11.241
Spiky stuff.

47:11.275 --> 47:14.448
[Sam] First thing I noticed with
Hector when I shook his hand

47:14.482 --> 47:18.068
was his hands were pretty much
the same size is mine, if bigger.

47:18.103 --> 47:19.758
I know what, like
work hands as well.

47:19.793 --> 47:23.655
So, straight away I
appreciated him as a person.

47:25.034 --> 47:28.103
Just looked like he'd been
working hard all his life.

47:41.034 --> 47:42.827
Reminds me so
much of my granddad,

47:42.862 --> 47:45.206
he'd pretty much just do the
same thing, work and not talk.

47:45.241 --> 47:46.241
And...

47:47.689 --> 47:51.241
You'd learn from
just watching...

47:51.275 --> 47:53.551
And doing.

47:53.586 --> 47:57.931
My grandad was a massive part of my life
because he taught me most things, really.

47:57.965 --> 48:01.068
Just... how to get on in life.

48:01.103 --> 48:04.000
But... suddenly passed away.

48:05.689 --> 48:08.586
It was just the hardest
thing in the world.

48:12.758 --> 48:16.034
His paternal grandad pepo,

48:16.068 --> 48:20.482
was so helpful with that sort
of physicality that Sam needs.

48:20.517 --> 48:23.034
Because he was such
a doer and a worker.

48:23.068 --> 48:26.103
I think his work ethic
has really helped Sam

48:26.137 --> 48:28.000
and he no doubt shaped him.

48:28.034 --> 48:29.275
Uh, absolutely, no doubt.

48:38.620 --> 48:43.172
[Sam] Enlisting yourself with
the actual people in thecountries,

48:43.206 --> 48:47.172
is one of the things that I never
thought I'd be capable of doing.

48:47.206 --> 48:51.655
But, like after me and Hector
and Hector's family here,

48:51.689 --> 48:53.586
they're just incredible people.

48:53.620 --> 48:55.241
I feel at peace
here, I feel at home.

48:56.103 --> 48:57.448
- Hey.
- [Women laughing]

48:58.586 --> 48:59.862
Like a lot, its hard work.

48:59.896 --> 49:01.689
[Chuckles] Perfecto.

49:01.724 --> 49:04.137
The way they live
their life is just great.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.931
[All] Gracias.

49:08.448 --> 49:12.137
This is beyond why...
My expectations were in.

49:12.172 --> 49:14.793
And that's what
I've loved about it.

49:14.827 --> 49:17.758
You actually feel like
you're part of the country.

49:17.793 --> 49:19.586
Now, that's what I think

49:19.620 --> 49:22.000
this trip should
mostly be about.

49:22.551 --> 49:23.827
[Speaking Spanish]

49:25.517 --> 49:27.931
[In Spanish]

49:39.068 --> 49:40.310
Ohh.

49:42.793 --> 49:44.758
[All] Ciao.

49:46.310 --> 49:47.551
I know.

49:48.482 --> 49:50.620
- You crying?
- No.

49:51.275 --> 49:52.758
Ciao.

49:52.793 --> 49:53.838
[Jo] I thought you were crying.

49:53.862 --> 49:55.551
- [Sam] No.
- [Jo] Okay.

49:55.586 --> 49:58.896
- [Sam] That's like, so embarrassing.
- [Jo] Okay, calm down.

49:58.931 --> 50:02.379
[John] With the checkpoint
still 450 kilometers away,

50:02.413 --> 50:06.379
Jo and Sam, begin their
descent towards salta.

50:06.413 --> 50:08.965
Sad to leave. That
was really brilliant.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.758
- A brilliant experience.
- Yeah.

50:10.793 --> 50:13.103
Um, but guess we've
got to get back to the race.

50:14.965 --> 50:16.931
[John] Preparing
to leave the city,

50:16.965 --> 50:18.862
Jen and Rob.

50:18.896 --> 50:24.000
Hoping hostel manager, Diego will make good
on his promise to drive them to cafayate.

50:25.793 --> 50:27.073
Uh, should we knock on his door?

50:27.103 --> 50:29.137
What if he's still in bed?

50:29.172 --> 50:30.517
Probably still in bed, isn't he?

50:30.551 --> 50:31.793
Oh, my days.

50:31.827 --> 50:33.586
[John] But he's
nowhere to be seen.

50:34.448 --> 50:36.241
Oh, how awks.
Come on, we need to.

50:36.275 --> 50:39.044
-Come on, let's play.
-'Cause we're wasting time. Okay, let's just be brave.

50:39.068 --> 50:41.182
[Jen clears throat] I'd
obviously want to say be brave.

50:41.206 --> 50:43.000
I mean, you be brave.

50:43.034 --> 50:44.206
And I'll just stand here.

50:49.206 --> 50:51.000
[Both whispering] What?

50:55.689 --> 50:56.689
Good morning.

50:58.310 --> 50:59.965
Did you go out, all night?

51:00.000 --> 51:02.448
- No, no, no.
- Have you just got in?

51:02.482 --> 51:03.965
- I went to sleep.
- [Jen laughing]

51:06.586 --> 51:10.103
So, it's probably not the most
sensibilist idea for him to drive us.

51:10.137 --> 51:12.206
I mean, this seems
completely safe.

51:12.241 --> 51:14.044
- He does look knackered.
- He does look knackered.

51:14.068 --> 51:16.389
- Thank you so much for offering. You're really kind.
- Not at all.

51:16.413 --> 51:19.482
- And here is our bed and breakfast money.
- No, no, no, it's not.

51:19.517 --> 51:22.103
- Yes, yes, yeah.
- No, no, thank you.

51:22.137 --> 51:24.724
- Yes.
- No, no, it's for you.

51:24.758 --> 51:26.793
- So, I dunno.
- I think he's really gutted.

51:26.827 --> 51:28.320
I think he's actually
really sad about it.

51:28.344 --> 51:30.413
And so we're just
gonna leg it right now

51:30.448 --> 51:33.206
- to the bus station and hope for the best.
- Yeah.

51:33.241 --> 51:35.310
[Jen] Oh, how disappointing.

51:35.344 --> 51:38.137
Diego, you naughty beast.

51:38.172 --> 51:41.000
[John] 500 kilometers
further from the checkpoint...

51:44.034 --> 51:46.931
Chile's atacama desert.

51:46.965 --> 51:48.965
[Lizzie] I've woken up
with a new mind and...

51:49.000 --> 51:52.034
Yeah, much happier
about our 48 hours here,

51:52.068 --> 51:54.448
and I think we're
just going to enjoy it.

51:54.482 --> 51:59.034
[Dom] This leg has just been
one stroke of bad luck after another.

51:59.068 --> 52:03.862
The only bit that's positive is that we've
discovered this beautiful part of Chile.

52:05.758 --> 52:08.551
When you're in these stunning
places, it sort of just makes you reflect

52:08.586 --> 52:09.758
on life in general.

52:11.448 --> 52:14.482
[Lizzie] This race has been
sort of like, weird, intense therapy.

52:14.517 --> 52:15.827
[Dom] Yeah, definitely.

52:15.862 --> 52:18.793
I know that we bickered
and argued the whole way,

52:18.827 --> 52:20.793
but the end of the
day, you're my sister.

52:21.103 --> 52:22.172
And...

52:22.206 --> 52:24.551
I care about you and I
want to spend time with you.

52:25.172 --> 52:26.862
- Okay?
- Okay. Yes.

52:29.551 --> 52:31.000
[Dom] I do love you, okay?

52:40.724 --> 52:42.758
- Is that the government?
- Oh.

52:42.793 --> 52:46.758
[John] An urgent message via
dom and Lizzie's GPS tracker.

52:46.793 --> 52:51.068
Civil unrest in Chile, need to evacuate
a.S.A.P. Before the border closes.

52:51.103 --> 52:52.034
Right?

52:52.068 --> 52:53.379
- What?
- Oh, my god!

52:54.034 --> 52:55.551
[Crowd shouting]

52:55.586 --> 52:58.068
[John] Starting in
the capital, Santiago,

52:58.103 --> 53:00.655
protests for political
and economic change

53:00.689 --> 53:02.551
have escalated into violence.

53:03.413 --> 53:05.482
And rapidly spread across Chile.

53:07.862 --> 53:10.724
With all borders likely
to close eminently,

53:10.758 --> 53:13.827
dom and Lizzie could find
themselves stranded indefinitely

53:13.862 --> 53:16.896
with no way of getting to
the checkpoint in Argentina.

53:18.862 --> 53:22.620
So, for their safety, immediate
evacuation is necessary.

53:25.310 --> 53:26.724
This is different to Ecuador,

53:26.758 --> 53:29.068
we're actually in the
country with civil unrest.

53:29.103 --> 53:31.655
-Let's move. A.S.A.P. Come on.
-Yeah.

53:32.862 --> 53:34.862
In, in, in.

53:34.896 --> 53:36.551
We need to get
to the checkpoint.

53:36.586 --> 53:40.379
So, the fastest
way out, possible.

53:40.413 --> 53:42.172
Maybe we can catch
up with the other teams.

53:49.379 --> 53:51.827
[John] 700
kilometers to the east,

53:51.862 --> 53:55.620
in Argentina, two teams
are arriving in cafayate.

53:57.034 --> 53:58.034
[Phone ringing]

53:58.068 --> 54:00.000
Okay. Thank you.

54:00.034 --> 54:03.241
[John] They received the checkpoint
details via their g.P.S. Tracker.

54:03.931 --> 54:05.172
Okay. Please proceed to...

54:05.206 --> 54:06.793
Grace cafayate by

54:06.827 --> 54:08.655
any means of transport
available to you.

54:11.206 --> 54:15.482
[John] Four and a half kilometers
away in the heart of the calchaqui valley,

54:15.517 --> 54:17.206
one of the region's vineyards.

54:17.241 --> 54:19.724
- [Rob] Right.
- [Jen] Oh, no, my pants have gone in my bum.

54:21.275 --> 54:23.103
[John] 90 minutes in a cab.

54:23.137 --> 54:24.482
Let's go to one of these shops.

54:24.517 --> 54:26.344
Anyone, man, ask anyone.

54:26.379 --> 54:28.206
[John] Or an
hour's hike on foot.

54:30.068 --> 54:31.965
- One block.
- Okay.

54:32.000 --> 54:33.655
The... the taxi's coming now

54:33.689 --> 54:35.369
they're all just
thinking I'm saying, "hi."

54:36.034 --> 54:37.034
Yeah, see? [Laughs]

54:39.241 --> 54:40.931
Let's ask this guy.

54:40.965 --> 54:42.689
- [Speaking Spanish]
- How are you?

54:42.724 --> 54:45.517
- Um, grace cafayate?
- Yes, for sure.

54:45.551 --> 54:46.896
You're going to
cross this bridge.

54:46.931 --> 54:49.275
One more block and on the
left you have the entrance.

54:49.310 --> 54:50.241
- Oh, amazing.
- Okay, cool.

54:50.275 --> 54:52.172
I wish we could stop
for wine, maybe later.

54:52.758 --> 54:54.137
I can't run a kilometer.

54:54.172 --> 54:56.172
So let's go and hail,
like a cab or something.

54:57.000 --> 54:58.240
Is that... no, it's not a taxi.

54:58.724 --> 55:01.655
- Um, a-ha!
- Yeah.

55:02.206 --> 55:03.655
Si, si, amigo.

55:03.689 --> 55:05.482
Rapido. Si. Si.

55:05.517 --> 55:08.344
There's a taxi. Please
be someone in here.

55:09.689 --> 55:11.344
- Nobody!
- Keep on walking.

55:13.793 --> 55:14.827
Hello?

55:14.862 --> 55:16.275
Somebody, please?

55:17.172 --> 55:18.172
Okay, whatever.

55:23.413 --> 55:24.413
Okay.

55:25.965 --> 55:27.655
Oh, we're here.

55:28.586 --> 55:30.068
[Pants] Far is our way, uncle.

55:31.413 --> 55:32.413
I can see someone.

55:35.379 --> 55:37.172
[John] While dom
and Lizzie still racing

55:37.206 --> 55:39.000
to the argentinian border,

55:39.034 --> 55:41.517
Jo and Sam have
descended from the mountains

55:41.551 --> 55:44.034
and are now 250 kilometers away.

55:44.482 --> 55:47.862
Oh, it's miles.

55:48.379 --> 55:50.172
I can't do it.

55:50.206 --> 55:52.526
- [Rob] You can, you're almost there.
- [Jen] I'm gonna cry.

55:53.586 --> 55:55.689
- Thought so...
- [Jen grunts in pain]

55:55.724 --> 55:57.482
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

55:57.517 --> 55:59.724
- [Rob] You can't carry on?
- [Jen sobs]

55:59.758 --> 56:01.689
[Rob] Almost
there, almost there.

56:01.724 --> 56:03.827
You're stronger than
you can ever imagine.

56:03.862 --> 56:04.862
So close now.

56:07.620 --> 56:11.241
[John] After five days
and 1,800 kilometers,

56:11.275 --> 56:12.862
the fifth checkpoint.

56:18.482 --> 56:21.172
[Speaking Spanish]

56:22.896 --> 56:25.551
Oh, my god. You have successfully
reached your fifth checkpoint.

56:25.586 --> 56:26.586
[Inaudible]

56:29.034 --> 56:30.517
Go on, then.

56:31.275 --> 56:33.103
- No way.
- [Jen sighs]

56:33.137 --> 56:34.137
Second.

56:40.620 --> 56:42.344
Whoo! We're first place.

56:42.379 --> 56:44.034
I'm really happy about that.

56:44.068 --> 56:47.000
We're getting closer, we're getting
more connected to one another

56:47.034 --> 56:49.620
because we have laid
everything out on the table.

56:49.655 --> 56:51.793
We've been able to make strides.

56:51.827 --> 56:53.187
Kind of think
you're all right now.

56:53.413 --> 56:55.413
Yeah, kinda.

56:55.448 --> 56:57.896
- I'm real chuffed with that.
- Thank you.

56:57.931 --> 57:00.551
-Thank you. [Speaking
Spanish] -Thank you very much.

57:00.586 --> 57:02.379
I'm just so
emotionally unstable.

57:03.275 --> 57:05.724
I think it's just because

57:05.758 --> 57:07.413
we try so hard.

57:07.448 --> 57:10.068
Probably had our worst low

57:10.103 --> 57:12.413
and our biggest high
this leg, didn't we?

57:12.448 --> 57:14.655
So being able to
maintain second position,

57:14.689 --> 57:16.482
whilst all of that was going on.

57:16.517 --> 57:18.310
It is pretty impressive.

57:18.344 --> 57:21.827
I just can't help thinking now,
had we got a lift with Diego.

57:21.862 --> 57:24.103
- Mm.
- Could have been first, maybe.

57:24.137 --> 57:26.000
But I'm happy to be second.

57:26.034 --> 57:29.137
I know my face isn't showing
it, but actually I am happy.

57:31.172 --> 57:33.206
[John] Five and
a half hours later...

57:33.241 --> 57:35.482
[Speaking Spanish]

57:38.827 --> 57:40.517
Why are we in such a rush, mum?

57:40.551 --> 57:43.241
'Cause we're in a
race. [Chuckling]

57:43.275 --> 57:46.379
The past was definitely
my lowest point so far.

57:46.413 --> 57:50.310
But then, when Sam had such a
good morning he was really buoyant.

57:50.344 --> 57:52.586
So, that just
brought me up again.

57:52.620 --> 57:54.827
And then from then
on it's been brilliant.

57:54.862 --> 57:56.620
This place looks swish.

57:56.655 --> 57:58.551
This looks amazing, doesn't it?

57:58.586 --> 58:00.137
It's been a brilliant week.

58:00.172 --> 58:01.931
Feels like being alive at least.

58:02.379 --> 58:03.724
Finally.

58:03.758 --> 58:06.137
For five weeks and it's...

58:08.413 --> 58:09.620
Yeah, there it is.

58:09.655 --> 58:11.355
-Jamiul already... got it right.
-We called it.

58:11.379 --> 58:13.034
Where's Liz and dom?

58:14.241 --> 58:15.413
[John] Next time.

58:15.448 --> 58:16.310
Ilha grande

58:16.344 --> 58:17.793
Brazil.

58:17.827 --> 58:19.527
I've actually never seen
anything like this in my life before.

58:19.551 --> 58:21.448
[John] Teams race
across the continent.

58:21.482 --> 58:23.448
[Jen] We're going so fast.

58:23.482 --> 58:24.931
[John] New alliances are formed.

58:24.965 --> 58:27.344
If we work together, we could
both advance in the leaders.

58:27.379 --> 58:29.206
[John] And new
awakenings are discovered.

58:29.241 --> 58:30.310
I've struggled.

58:30.344 --> 58:31.931
I'm same as you, dom.

58:31.965 --> 58:32.896
Shouldn't be like this, man.

58:32.931 --> 58:34.310
[Jo] Life's fragile.

58:34.344 --> 58:36.344
And you really don't know
what's around the corner.
