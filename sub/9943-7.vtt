00:05.080 --> 00:07.359
The Chatsworth Estate
is no Garden of Eden,

00:07.360 --> 00:10.759
but it's been a good home to me,
Frank Gallagher, and me kids,

00:10.760 --> 00:14.979
who I'm proud of,
cos every single one of 'em

00:15.180 --> 00:16.979
reminds me a little of me.

00:18.120 --> 00:21.519
They can all think for themselves,
which they've me to thank for.

00:22.020 --> 00:26.019
Lip, a bit of a gobshite, which is
why nobody calls him Philip now.

00:26.340 --> 00:28.939
Ian, a lot like his mam,
which was handy for the others

00:28.940 --> 00:31.459
when she disappeared into thin air.

00:31.960 --> 00:34.799
And Carl - daren't let him
grow his hair for two reasons.

00:34.800 --> 00:38.799
One, it stands on end and makes him
look like Toyah. Two, nits love it.

00:38.800 --> 00:42.799
Debbie! Sent by God. Total angel.
You should check your change,

00:43.600 --> 00:45.999
but she'll go miles out of her way
to do you a favour.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.999
Plus little Liam.
Gonna be a star some day.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.999
Monica, the wife.
She's back, with her bird in tow,

00:54.800 --> 00:56.559
and we can't get shot of her.

00:56.560 --> 00:58.599
And the neighbours, eh?

00:58.600 --> 01:02.479
The neighbours.
Well, what can you say?

01:02.480 --> 01:06.319
Nothing, if you don'twant your arms
breaking. Still, nobody's perfect.

01:06.320 --> 01:09.959
But, all of 'em, to a man,
know first and foremost

01:09.960 --> 01:12.959
one of the most vital necessities
in life is

01:12.960 --> 01:16.959
they know how to throw a party!
Heh, heh!

01:17.200 --> 01:20.439
Scatter!

01:20.440 --> 01:24.439
Geniophobia means fear of chins.
I mean, how mental is that?

01:26.280 --> 01:28.919
There are enough people in the world
scared of chins,

01:28.920 --> 01:31.559
someone bothered
to invent a word for it.

01:31.560 --> 01:35.479
At least be scared of something
rational, like, uh, kebab shops,

01:35.480 --> 01:38.999
or that meat paste you used to have
in your sandwiches for packed lunch.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.559
Only thing I'm scared
of is losing my Mon.

01:41.560 --> 01:44.159
Monophobia, probably.
And that's a big one.

01:44.160 --> 01:48.159
Trouble is, fear can make
you do irrational things.

01:48.320 --> 01:49.719
Frank!

01:49.720 --> 01:50.759
Huh? What the...?

01:50.760 --> 01:53.519
Huh? What the...?
Three little words.

01:53.520 --> 01:55.759
Just three little words.

01:55.760 --> 01:58.519
Pink Ladies jacket.

01:58.520 --> 02:01.759
That's what you promised me!

02:01.760 --> 02:05.759
December 1st, 1979 outside the ABC,
and did I ever get one? No!

02:07.440 --> 02:08.999
What the fuck you on about, Monica?

02:09.000 --> 02:12.479
What the fuck you on about, Monica?
You've let me down me whole life!

02:12.480 --> 02:15.319
That's all you've ever done! (SOBS)

02:15.320 --> 02:18.159
You been snorting your HRT again?

02:18.160 --> 02:21.919
Oh, that's right. Blame it on my
hormones, just like you always do!

02:21.920 --> 02:25.439
I mean, you know, pink jacket? What
the fuck are you on about, Monica?

02:25.440 --> 02:28.119
I'm half-awake here
and you're, "Neh, neh, neh, neh!"

02:28.120 --> 02:29.999
It makes you understand
OJ fucking...

02:30.000 --> 02:31.399
It makes you understand
OJ fucking...
I don't feel wanted, Frank!

02:31.400 --> 02:33.559
It makes you understand
OJ fucking...
I don't feel wanted, Frank!
Oh, God! Give it a fucking rest!

02:33.560 --> 02:35.279
You chose meinstead of Sheila...

02:35.280 --> 02:39.279
You chose meinstead of Sheila...
I didn't choose you. I chose her.

02:44.760 --> 02:48.759
Anyway,
I'm still sleeping with Norma.

02:49.680 --> 02:52.119
Yeah, good on you, bird.

02:52.120 --> 02:54.359
You told him, then? I knew you would.

02:54.360 --> 02:56.479
What do you think of that, then,
Frank?

02:56.480 --> 02:59.359
Not quite the king dick
you thought you was, eh?

02:59.360 --> 03:00.479
(LAUGHS)

03:00.480 --> 03:02.999
(LAUGHS)
Oh, shut up, Norma!

03:03.000 --> 03:06.999
Why do you always have to be there
every time I turn round?

03:09.600 --> 03:11.999
Five, six, seven, ten.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.399
Thank you, love. Come on, love. Bye.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.119
Hey, this ain't right.

03:16.120 --> 03:18.359
Hey, this ain't right.
Thanks a lot, love.

03:18.360 --> 03:20.279
Thank you.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.359
Ian says you wanted some...

03:21.360 --> 03:22.719
Ian says you wanted some...
Shh. Follow me.

03:22.720 --> 03:23.919
Have you got a job for me?

03:23.920 --> 03:26.559
Have you got a job for me?
This way. Come on.

03:26.560 --> 03:27.719
Come on, hurry up.

03:27.720 --> 03:29.959
Come on, hurry up.
Where are you taking me, Yvonne?

PHONES RING

03:35.400 --> 03:36.039
What's all this about?

03:36.040 --> 03:39.999
What's all this about?
Call centre. Subcontracted it
from Mumbai Telecom.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.559
They can't keep the staff over there.

03:42.560 --> 03:46.199
Who can blame 'em? Being shouted at
all day by pig-thick customers

03:46.200 --> 03:49.599
from over here who think they're God.
No amount of money's worth that.

03:49.600 --> 03:52.079
So what are you saying?
The calls go via India

03:52.080 --> 03:53.399
thenget re-routed back here?

03:53.400 --> 03:55.919
thenget re-routed back here?
Yeah. Nice little earner.

03:55.920 --> 03:58.559
Got trouble with IT, though.
These computers are shite.

03:58.560 --> 04:02.399
I'll give you ten quid an hour
if you sort 'em out for me.

04:02.400 --> 04:05.279
How does it go again,
Yvonne, with the phones?

04:05.280 --> 04:08.999
For God's sake, Lilian.
You answer the call.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.879
You make out you're Indian,
pretending to be English.

04:12.880 --> 04:16.159
And every now and then,
chuck summat in about the weather.

04:16.160 --> 04:19.119
Or curry. Or whatever
you've had for your lunch.

04:19.120 --> 04:23.079
Something that sounds English.

04:23.080 --> 04:25.519
Nadia'll show you
what's wrong with the computers.

04:25.520 --> 04:27.879
PHONE RINGS

04:27.880 --> 04:29.879
(BAD INDIAN ACCENT) Hello? Yes.

04:29.880 --> 04:33.719
I am being very happy
to hear from you. Fish and chips.

04:33.720 --> 04:37.719
It's a good job
I'm only paying her Mumbai rates.

04:38.240 --> 04:42.239
Excuse me. They won't let us
put the data into them properly.

04:44.640 --> 04:48.639
Right. Do you want to show me?

04:53.520 --> 04:57.519
Right. Right, what I thought
we'd do, Mon, was, um...

04:57.640 --> 05:01.639
uh, we'd...go out,
just you and me,

05:02.280 --> 05:05.399
and talk.And eat...

05:05.400 --> 05:07.279
What with, Frank?

05:07.280 --> 05:11.279
Well...

05:11.800 --> 05:15.079
What are you doing, Monica?

05:15.080 --> 05:18.279
Have you seen this, Frank?
Have you seen what Norma got me?

05:18.280 --> 05:20.879
28 years I've waited for you
to get me one of these,

05:20.880 --> 05:23.319
and Norma goes and gets it for me
just like that.

05:23.320 --> 05:24.679
Well, give her a peanut!

05:24.680 --> 05:27.159
Well, give her a peanut!
Hey! Are you calling me a monkey?

05:27.160 --> 05:31.159
The point I'm making, Frank, is
that Norma puts herself out for me.

05:32.720 --> 05:34.519
She buys me things.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.599
If a fucking jacket's
all it takes...

05:36.600 --> 05:37.959
Oh, you just watch your mouth!

05:37.960 --> 05:41.959
Oh, you just watch your mouth!
Oh, piss off, Shrek!

05:44.360 --> 05:45.919
(MUFFLED) Fucking hell!

05:45.920 --> 05:49.679
And that impresses you, does it?

05:49.680 --> 05:50.799
That what you want?

05:50.800 --> 05:54.799
That what you want?
What I want, Frank,
is somebody who will fight for me,

05:55.000 --> 05:58.999
and make me feel wanted.

06:00.600 --> 06:03.999
OK. So...

06:04.000 --> 06:06.039
Your name's Lip, isn't it?

06:06.040 --> 06:07.999
Yeah.How do you know that?

06:08.000 --> 06:11.999
I think I've just...
Maybe I've seen you around.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.199
I wish I could say the same.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.999
How's it going?

06:19.000 --> 06:22.999
Yeah. Sweet.

06:23.320 --> 06:26.559
No sweat.
Should be able to get this sorted.

06:26.560 --> 06:28.359
Right.

06:28.360 --> 06:32.359
See you later, then.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.919
Do you think
it'll take long to sort out?

06:38.920 --> 06:42.719
Well...computers are...

prettytricky things.

KNOCK ON DOOR

06:49.320 --> 06:51.559
Are you OK?

06:51.560 --> 06:55.559
Yeah, course I am.

06:58.400 --> 07:02.399
"Are you OK?" Course I'm OK!

07:09.040 --> 07:11.439
Don't let her get to you.

07:11.440 --> 07:15.439
She's only sleeping with Norma
cos she buys her things.

07:15.440 --> 07:17.519
But she's doing it for the money.

07:17.520 --> 07:21.519
And Norma's got a wallet-full
at the moment.

07:22.880 --> 07:26.879
Back in the game, kid.

Bastard truckers try and jump us.

Shut up!

I'm saying me homework blew up.

10:01.020 --> 10:04.179
This is the third one this week.
It has gotta be a campaign.

10:04.180 --> 10:07.059
It's just kids, they're
bored and get the bangers out.

10:07.060 --> 10:09.099
This is no way just kids, Stan.

10:09.100 --> 10:11.979
Co-ordinated attacks.
This could be serious.

10:11.980 --> 10:12.779
No.

10:12.780 --> 10:15.619
Right, we asked you to stay back.

10:15.620 --> 10:18.859
We've got live explosives so,

10:24.820 --> 10:26.579

10:26.580 --> 10:30.259
Kids and them fireworks. Haven't
had a wink of sleep for nights.

10:30.260 --> 10:34.259
That's no fireworks. Just been
another one right outside yours.

10:34.420 --> 10:35.379
What do you mean?

10:35.380 --> 10:38.579
Police everywhere,
sniffer dogs, the lot.

10:38.580 --> 10:41.779
Oh my God! We're under attack!

10:41.780 --> 10:42.779
What's all the ballyhoo?

10:42.780 --> 10:46.779
Bomb's has gone off or something,
somewhere near yours.

10:54.980 --> 10:58.979
Christ!

11:00.380 --> 11:03.619
Bit old for a midnight
feast, aren't you?

11:03.620 --> 11:05.419
Have you turfed any pans out?

11:05.420 --> 11:07.099
I've lost something. >

11:07.100 --> 11:09.659
I've lost something. >
Your marbles, by the looks of it.

11:09.660 --> 11:13.659
No, it's just the thing I have
lost, it's a wee bit important!

11:17.060 --> 11:19.619
I've misplaced...

11:19.620 --> 11:23.619
The thing I've misplaced...

11:25.300 --> 11:29.299
My Semtex, I've lost my Semtex.

11:29.900 --> 11:33.739
You've had Semtex in this house!

11:33.740 --> 11:36.659
You promised never again, Paddy.

11:36.660 --> 11:39.579
It took ages for my eyebrows
to grow back after

11:39.580 --> 11:42.619
that fertiliser went off
in the airing cupboard.

11:42.620 --> 11:45.299
The Semtex isn't mine.

11:45.300 --> 11:49.299
Remember those two guys who came
round with the salmon?

11:57.140 --> 12:00.539
They're not my cousins.

12:00.540 --> 12:02.699
Who are they?

12:02.700 --> 12:06.699
I've got to do a job
with them, crack a safe.

12:07.180 --> 12:08.819
Payback for the old days.

12:08.820 --> 12:12.059
I wouldn't have had it in
the cupboard otherwise, would I?

12:12.060 --> 12:16.059
What the hell am I supposed to do?!

12:37.100 --> 12:41.099
There's another one gone off
outside the bus station.

12:41.220 --> 12:42.739
We're already on to it.

12:42.740 --> 12:45.499
Stan's volunteered to help.

12:45.500 --> 12:49.499
We're doing surveillance.
Just off out now.

12:53.460 --> 12:57.459
I have come to report
an attempted rape.

12:59.900 --> 13:01.779
Oh, well, Stan's your man.

13:01.780 --> 13:05.779
I'd be useless, y'know,
women's stuff, all that.

13:06.580 --> 13:09.259
You'd better take this one, Stan.

13:09.260 --> 13:12.579
I'll need a WPC though to
take a statement. Carrie...

13:12.580 --> 13:15.899
We'll see you later, so.
I'll do your surveillance for you.

13:15.900 --> 13:19.339
Good luck.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.979
Are you gonna
pay attention or what?

13:21.980 --> 13:25.979
I am a vulnerable woman.

13:26.340 --> 13:28.259
Mum, how do you spell emphysema?

13:28.260 --> 13:30.619
What's that you've got?

13:30.620 --> 13:31.779
Sick note.

13:31.780 --> 13:33.739
Ask your father.

13:33.740 --> 13:36.379
He's not here.

13:36.380 --> 13:39.219
Or look in the dictionary.

13:39.220 --> 13:42.059
But I don't know how you spell it.

13:42.060 --> 13:46.059
Fucking hell.

13:53.580 --> 13:57.579
Frank...?

14:01.860 --> 14:04.179
You're a bit keen, aren't you?
It's only eight.

14:04.180 --> 14:07.459
I said I'd look at
that laptop for Nadia.

14:07.460 --> 14:08.099
Right.

14:08.100 --> 14:08.819
Fuck off!

14:08.820 --> 14:10.619
Fancy her, do ya?

14:10.620 --> 14:12.579
I'm with Mandy, in
case you hadn't noticed.

14:12.580 --> 14:16.579
Yeah, but, y'know, gorgeous girl,
what bloke wouldn't, eh?

14:17.580 --> 14:19.019
Well, except you, obviously.

14:19.020 --> 14:21.939
Well, except you, obviously.
For Christ's sake, Lip, keep up!

14:21.940 --> 14:24.659
Nadia's a bloke.

14:24.660 --> 14:26.939
Naz! I thought you knew.

14:26.940 --> 14:28.539
Fuck off!

14:28.540 --> 14:32.539
Everybody else does. I thought
the name would have given it away.
D'you never watch Big Brother?

14:36.220 --> 14:39.619
Oh, and you think that's funny,
do ya? Why didn't you stop me?

14:39.620 --> 14:40.579
Stop what?

14:40.580 --> 14:43.059
Flirting with her...

14:43.060 --> 14:44.259
It's disgusting.

14:44.260 --> 14:47.619
It's disgusting.
You what?

14:47.620 --> 14:48.979
You what, Lip?

14:48.980 --> 14:51.139
You don't joke about
stuff like that.

14:51.140 --> 14:55.139
Should have fucking known.

14:56.220 --> 14:57.219
Hiya, Lip.

14:57.220 --> 15:01.219
Just stay away from me!

15:02.900 --> 15:06.899
Outside, please! This is
confidential police business.

15:10.900 --> 15:13.779
Are we really allowed
to bug people's phones?

15:13.780 --> 15:17.019
How else are we gonna find out
who's trying to blow this estate up?

15:17.020 --> 15:18.619
You think they're gonna
talk about it over the phone?

15:18.620 --> 15:20.259
Ssh!

15:20.260 --> 15:22.139
That's it coming.

15:22.140 --> 15:24.179
'Am I speaking to an angling man?'

15:24.180 --> 15:27.419
Oh, it's cousin Michael, is it?

15:27.420 --> 15:29.819
Sorry about that, Michael.
Bit of noise here.

15:29.820 --> 15:32.499
What's that, Michael? Sorry, Michael.

15:32.500 --> 15:34.499
'The water's calm tonight.'

15:34.500 --> 15:35.499
Tonight?

15:35.500 --> 15:37.059
'Bring your tackle.'

15:37.060 --> 15:41.059
Right.

15:43.700 --> 15:47.699
Shit! Fuck! Shit! Shit!
Shitty shit! Shit! Shit!

16:03.620 --> 16:07.619
Mickey, that stuff I gave you
to get shot of - Semtex.

16:08.700 --> 16:10.979
What have you done with it?

16:10.980 --> 16:12.939
I buried it.

16:12.940 --> 16:14.099
Listen, I want it back.

16:14.100 --> 16:16.579
Listen, I want it back.
You said you didn't want
it in the house again.

16:16.580 --> 16:17.939
It's not your dad's.

16:17.940 --> 16:19.979
It belongs to his cousins.

16:19.980 --> 16:23.979
They need it tonight,
so fucking un-bury it before

16:24.220 --> 16:28.219
they bury your dad, all right?

16:30.020 --> 16:34.019
Move, dickhead.

16:35.380 --> 16:37.779
Debbie, love, have you seen your dad?

16:37.780 --> 16:39.299
He ran off with the milkman.

16:39.300 --> 16:42.579
He's never up this early and
the Dormobile's not there either.

16:42.580 --> 16:46.579
Maybe he ran off with Norma,
the love they couldn't fight.

16:52.580 --> 16:55.299
So he tried to rape you,
but somehow you got his pants?

16:55.300 --> 16:56.779
Men!

16:56.780 --> 16:59.459
Women unite!

16:59.460 --> 17:01.219
Reclaim the nights!

17:01.220 --> 17:03.659
Hey, I know self-defence, me.

17:03.660 --> 17:07.659
Wouldn't have to if you lot did
your jobs properly. What the fuck?!

17:11.020 --> 17:15.019
So, where is he then?

17:23.900 --> 17:26.419
Well, I don't know.
No-one's seen either of them

17:26.420 --> 17:30.419
and I'm not happy about it.

17:36.260 --> 17:40.259
Hiya.

17:48.500 --> 17:52.499
I don't know.
Nothing but dramas in this house.

17:57.860 --> 17:59.779
What am I supposed to have done?

17:59.780 --> 18:01.859
I was just angry, all right. Nadia.

18:01.860 --> 18:04.939
Doesn't exactly fit the Trade
Descriptions Act, does it?

18:04.940 --> 18:07.739
"But it's disgusting!" Just because
it's a bloke who fancies you?

18:07.740 --> 18:09.419
No.

18:09.420 --> 18:11.659
That's what you said, innit?

18:11.660 --> 18:14.739
You're the only person in this place
who I thought I understood.

18:14.740 --> 18:16.059
Fuck's sake, Ian.

18:16.060 --> 18:17.019
You just don't get it, do you?

18:17.020 --> 18:20.219
I was the one who kept this a
secret for you for all this time.

18:20.220 --> 18:21.139
Yeah, I wonder why!

18:21.140 --> 18:22.419
What?

18:22.420 --> 18:26.419
OK, come on, let's go down the pub
and telleveryone you're gay.

18:26.780 --> 18:27.739
Is that what you want?

18:27.740 --> 18:31.739
Is that what you want?
Piss off, they'd fucking kill me,
you know they would. Fuck you, Lip!

18:31.860 --> 18:35.859
Yeah, you want to.

18:36.380 --> 18:37.579
What's going on?

18:37.580 --> 18:38.819
What are you fighting for?

18:38.820 --> 18:42.819
Get out, will you!

18:48.900 --> 18:52.899
Serves you right for flirting with
another girl then - sorry, boy.

18:52.980 --> 18:56.179
How would you like it if
another girl came on to you?

18:56.180 --> 18:59.979
Wouldn't bother me.
Anyway, I've snogged loads of girls.

18:59.980 --> 19:01.739
Oh, come on.

19:01.740 --> 19:05.739
Quickest way to turn a lad on
is pretending to be a lesbian.
Or hadn't you noticed?

19:06.780 --> 19:08.579
Anyway, you shag me up the arse.

19:08.580 --> 19:10.059
Yeah, but that's different.

19:10.060 --> 19:12.819
Is it?

19:12.820 --> 19:16.819
You need to sort this out with Ian.

19:18.100 --> 19:21.619
Well?

19:21.620 --> 19:25.619
Look, Debs, there's some things
you don't know, that you might...

19:25.780 --> 19:28.419
I know you're gay, Ian.

19:28.420 --> 19:29.979
It's obvious. >

19:29.980 --> 19:33.779
You haven't exactly got girlfriends
coming out of your ears, have you?

19:33.780 --> 19:37.259
And you can dance. >

19:37.260 --> 19:39.059
Does Carl know too?

19:43.060 --> 19:47.059
He doesn't care, Ian,
and neither do I.

19:49.220 --> 19:53.219
Pity Lip don't feel the same.

20:10.740 --> 20:13.299
It's funny, isn't it...

20:13.300 --> 20:15.179
being...

20:15.180 --> 20:17.979
cooped up here in this...

20:17.980 --> 20:21.979
tiny space together.

20:23.420 --> 20:25.779
It makes you feel kind of...

20:25.780 --> 20:27.299
Bored, yeah, I know.

20:27.300 --> 20:30.459
Why do you think I
put in for a transfer?

20:30.460 --> 20:33.099
A mate of mine in Nottingham
gets riots twice a week.

20:33.100 --> 20:34.699
The best we get is a tent.

20:34.700 --> 20:38.699
Yes, and you say
that, but look at us here!

20:40.100 --> 20:41.739
Tapping the phone!

20:41.740 --> 20:43.259
Listen!

20:43.260 --> 20:45.659
WOMAN SPEAKS IN NATIVE TONGUE

20:45.660 --> 20:47.179
Bingo!

20:47.180 --> 20:51.179
SIRENS WAIL

20:52.860 --> 20:54.939
That's it there.
Let's bust 'em!

20:54.940 --> 20:57.259
Stay back, sweetheart.
You've done your bit.

20:57.260 --> 20:59.179
Now leave it to the pros.

20:59.180 --> 21:01.739
What?

21:01.740 --> 21:05.739
This can't be right.
It's Yvonne's shop.

21:06.100 --> 21:08.099
Police!

21:08.100 --> 21:11.779
SCREAMING

21:11.780 --> 21:13.819
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

21:13.820 --> 21:16.459
Arresting a terrorist cell.
Get your head down!

21:16.460 --> 21:20.459
Calm down!

21:22.140 --> 21:23.979
Don't know what you're
doing with that, do you?

21:23.980 --> 21:27.019
Dad's gonna fucking kill us,
you know.

21:27.020 --> 21:29.259
I'll open it for you, dickhead.

21:29.260 --> 21:31.819
I buried it over there.

21:31.820 --> 21:32.459
Over there!

21:32.460 --> 21:33.539
Bastard.

21:33.540 --> 21:37.499
(TV) And, despite the ongoing
investigation, police are no closer

21:37.500 --> 21:39.579
to catching the bombers.

21:39.580 --> 21:43.379
In other news, local journalist
and broadcaster Tariq Omar

21:43.380 --> 21:47.379
received a special award for his
interview with Osama Bin Laden.

21:47.780 --> 21:51.139
How he gained access to Bin Laden,
America's most wanted terrorist,

21:51.140 --> 21:54.259
is a secret he refuses to divulge.

21:54.260 --> 21:57.619
Bin Laden, who the White House
say could be anywhere in the world,

21:57.620 --> 22:01.619
hasn't been seen since
he was spotted in the stands...

22:03.020 --> 22:04.659
Right, so...

22:04.660 --> 22:08.059
We can rule out the claim that
you're the world's most wanted man.

22:08.060 --> 22:10.859
Stan, come on!

22:10.860 --> 22:14.859
But that leaves a much
more serious complaint.

22:15.220 --> 22:18.699
Ms Starkey
alleges that you tried to rape her.

22:18.700 --> 22:22.219
Ms Starkey
alleges that you tried to rape her.
Have you seen her yourself?

22:22.220 --> 22:24.459
In person?

22:24.460 --> 22:26.979
Miss Starkey alleges that
you broke into her van.

22:26.980 --> 22:29.939
MY van! Not broken,
the door was open.

22:29.940 --> 22:33.619
In the early hours of the morning.
What were you doing, Frank?

22:33.620 --> 22:35.179
I was just...

22:35.180 --> 22:36.779
If you didn't actually touch her...

22:36.780 --> 22:38.379
No, I didn't.

22:38.380 --> 22:39.019
Well, then...

22:39.020 --> 22:41.259
Well, I mean, I did, but...

22:41.260 --> 22:45.259
I only wanted to get my hands
on her...on something that

22:48.580 --> 22:51.699
she had that I wanted.

22:51.700 --> 22:55.699
The, the... I mean, all right,

22:56.060 --> 22:59.059
I did touch her,
but just a little bit,

22:59.060 --> 23:03.059
just here...

23:03.140 --> 23:06.099
Norma Starkey is
pressing charges of attempted rape,

23:06.100 --> 23:10.099
so you'll be taken to court this
afternoon to plead, pending a trial.

23:11.980 --> 23:15.019
No means no, Frank.
This is serious.

23:15.020 --> 23:19.019
You could get ten years.

23:23.240 --> 23:25.919
Oh! So, there you are(!)

23:25.920 --> 23:29.599
I don't suppose it occurred to you
that I'd been worried sick all day?!

23:30.840 --> 23:33.799
There's something
I need to tell you.

23:33.800 --> 23:37.799
Frank... Frank...

23:38.040 --> 23:40.199
He tried to rape me.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.239
Don't be so ridiculous, Norma.

23:42.240 --> 23:44.199
What a stupid thing to say.

23:44.200 --> 23:46.999
No, no. It's true, right, Mon.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.999
Last night, he...
came into the van and he...

23:54.040 --> 23:55.639
..he touched us.

23:55.640 --> 23:58.239
You're not his type, Norm.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.999
Anyway, why should he want
to do that when he's got me?

24:01.000 --> 24:04.679
Although he very nearly didn't
the time you two have been gone.

24:04.680 --> 24:08.439
I've been so hungry. I haven't been
able to eat anything all day.

24:08.440 --> 24:10.279
I've been that churned up.

24:10.280 --> 24:11.199
But Mon, right, he...!

24:11.200 --> 24:15.199
Norm, isn't it nice,

24:15.360 --> 24:18.879
just you and me in the house...

24:18.880 --> 24:22.879
Frank not here?

24:24.200 --> 24:28.199
Ooh! Uh.

24:34.320 --> 24:38.319
So you...you want me
to get you some food then?

24:40.160 --> 24:42.239
That'd be nice.

24:42.240 --> 24:46.239
And you've got a
proper kitchen to use, an'all.

24:46.680 --> 24:50.679
I'll just finish
watching my programme.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.599
It's not here, Micky! >

24:57.600 --> 24:59.359
It's not here!

24:59.360 --> 25:03.159
It's not fucking there!
What the fuck did you do with it?

25:10.160 --> 25:14.159
Hello, there. What can I do for you?

25:15.640 --> 25:17.279
They say I'm the stupid one!

25:17.280 --> 25:19.159
You're hurting me!

25:19.160 --> 25:21.519
Which organisation do you work for?

25:21.520 --> 25:25.519
It's some kind of car insurance,
I think. We don't really...

25:25.880 --> 25:27.399
Which terror organisation?

25:27.400 --> 25:28.839
Come again?

25:28.840 --> 25:32.839
Who gives you your orders
of where to bomb?

25:33.400 --> 25:35.599
It's a fucking call-centre!

25:35.600 --> 25:37.399
Where's my one phone call? >

25:37.400 --> 25:40.839
You don't get another sentence
out of me till my lawyer gets here.

25:40.840 --> 25:43.839
Let's try again. You claim
you're innocent, so explain

25:43.840 --> 25:47.839
why you were on the phone today
ordering deadly poison.

25:48.040 --> 25:49.359
I never.

25:49.360 --> 25:50.199
We've got you on tape!

25:50.200 --> 25:53.279
Your voice. Your phone line.

25:53.280 --> 25:55.799
Ordering ricin.

25:55.800 --> 25:58.199
Oh, no. I know what that was.

25:58.200 --> 26:02.199
It was all that talk about lunch
made me hungry so I rang my friend

26:02.520 --> 26:04.759
at Mumbai Telecom.

26:04.760 --> 26:07.599
Before you serve the jalfrezi,

26:07.600 --> 26:11.239
mix in a little bit of garam
masala and fresh coriander.

26:11.240 --> 26:12.439
Lovely.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.519
And sprinkle a little bit on top.

26:14.520 --> 26:18.519
I'll have to get some rice in.

26:23.760 --> 26:25.639
If you'd like to go back to work...

26:25.640 --> 26:27.799
You must be fucking joking!

26:27.800 --> 26:30.719
Hey! There's a fine for
that kind of language!

26:30.720 --> 26:34.719
I know about unlawful arrest,
police harassment
and racial discrimination.

26:36.040 --> 26:37.559
There's no need for
anyone to get their...

26:37.560 --> 26:41.559
Six-figure compensation for
distress and loss of earnings?

26:42.400 --> 26:44.479
I can have your balls on a plate.

26:44.480 --> 26:48.479
Not if I get them first.

26:55.640 --> 26:59.639
Stan, me old mate.
Can I have a word?

27:02.040 --> 27:06.039
Well?

27:09.320 --> 27:12.879
Bored! Bored! Bored!

27:12.880 --> 27:16.879
Roll on my transfer.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.759
You made the fucking bombs?!

27:20.760 --> 27:22.799
You don't want her to transfer!

27:22.800 --> 27:25.239
And I hadn't logged the stuff,

27:25.240 --> 27:27.879
so I looked up how to make
them on the internet.

27:27.880 --> 27:30.359
It's gone a little bit wrong...

27:30.360 --> 27:31.799
You're telling me?!

27:31.800 --> 27:34.079
Don't grass us up, Stan.

27:34.080 --> 27:37.719
I wanted to give her a bit
of excitement, you know?

27:37.720 --> 27:40.959
If Yvonne makes the complaint,
they'll find out it was me

27:40.960 --> 27:42.279
and I'll lose me job!

27:42.280 --> 27:44.439
And you'll be implicated, too.

27:44.440 --> 27:48.439
And then we'll all be in the shit!

27:49.360 --> 27:53.359
All right. But I want all your
shifts with her for the next
two months - days and nights.

27:57.320 --> 28:00.239
You have fucking
proper pickled my head.

28:00.240 --> 28:04.199
Why have you had us digging
if you knew Semtex weren't there?

28:04.200 --> 28:05.839
I thought you'd grass me up.

28:05.840 --> 28:06.879
Who to?

28:06.880 --> 28:09.479
To mam and dad cos
you're a spiteful bastard.

28:09.480 --> 28:12.719
Dad's gonna fucking kill us,
you know that.

28:12.720 --> 28:14.079
Why? It was me who did it.

28:14.080 --> 28:16.319
But I'll get the blamed,
I always do! You know I will!

28:16.320 --> 28:20.319
Sshhh!

28:22.120 --> 28:23.799
Is that mum's hand cream?

28:23.800 --> 28:27.119
Is that mum's hand cream?
No.

28:27.120 --> 28:31.119
We can't leave here
until we think of a plan.

28:44.080 --> 28:47.639
All day in a court house cos...

28:47.640 --> 28:50.839
Oh, look. It's the filthy pervert.

28:50.840 --> 28:54.839
In your fucking dreams.
I've had a restraining order
slapped on me, haven't I?

28:55.720 --> 28:57.119
Can't come within 50 feet of ya.

28:57.120 --> 28:58.359
Then sod off!

28:58.360 --> 29:01.599
Er... It's my house!

29:01.600 --> 29:04.359
So fly! Fly, bird!

29:04.360 --> 29:06.519
50 feet, back to the van.

29:06.520 --> 29:10.079
Or further into the traffic,
in Dusseldorf.

29:10.080 --> 29:12.519
I can't be here with him!
It's too traumatic.

29:12.520 --> 29:14.919
I'm having flashbacks.

29:14.920 --> 29:18.919
You know where I am if you want me.

29:19.520 --> 29:21.519
What's she meant to have done?

29:21.520 --> 29:24.599
I didn't know where you were,
Frank. I've been worried.

29:24.600 --> 29:27.479
Woke up all on my own.

29:27.480 --> 29:31.479
Monica, she's accused
me of trying to rape her.

29:31.640 --> 29:34.599
I mean, I didn't do it.
Of course I fucking didn't.

29:34.600 --> 29:38.599
It's all a ruse to get me out
of the way so she can... Innit?

29:38.920 --> 29:42.919
And then there's the Old Bill doing
the dance...and they believe her!

29:45.520 --> 29:49.519
I'm serious, Monica!
They're saying I could go to prison.

29:50.640 --> 29:54.639
It always has to be about you,
doesn't it?

30:00.440 --> 30:02.879
She accused you of rape?

30:02.880 --> 30:06.879
She accused you of rape?
Yeah, I know.

30:10.640 --> 30:12.679
What do you think
you're doing, Norma?

30:12.680 --> 30:14.319
Dad wouldn't have raped you.

30:14.320 --> 30:16.119
You stay out of this, Debbie.

30:16.120 --> 30:18.279
It's a police matter now.

30:18.280 --> 30:22.279
You don't know what men are capable
of when they unleash their...

30:27.160 --> 30:30.639
Look, I know you're a
bright kid, Debbie. But...

30:30.640 --> 30:34.119
What happened to
lesbianwomenfortruthandjustice.com?!

30:34.120 --> 30:37.599
Why is the woman never believed?

30:37.600 --> 30:40.039
He wasn't trying to rape you,
Norma.

30:40.040 --> 30:44.039
Wasn't he after your money?

30:44.880 --> 30:46.919
Are you gonna file
my complaint or...?

30:46.920 --> 30:48.519
Certainly.

30:48.520 --> 30:50.279
I just need to see your
licence for the business.

30:50.280 --> 30:51.599
My...?

30:51.600 --> 30:54.959
Your licence?
I take it you do have one.

30:54.960 --> 30:58.959
And proof that you're paying the
minimum wage and making NI staff
contributions and paying tax.

31:01.600 --> 31:05.599
I think it must be at the shop.
I'll go and get it.

31:11.560 --> 31:13.719
Tom? >

31:13.720 --> 31:17.719
Super wants to see us.

31:36.040 --> 31:36.959
Double whisky.

31:36.960 --> 31:39.399
What's the matter with you?

31:39.400 --> 31:42.559
Bastard bombers.

31:42.560 --> 31:46.559
Just ruin it for the
rest of us, don't they?

31:49.280 --> 31:53.079
How am I supposed to get hold of any
Semtex when nobody's shifting any?

31:53.080 --> 31:57.079
How the hell should I know?!

32:00.560 --> 32:01.799
Three.

32:01.800 --> 32:04.639
No way. A quid 50.

32:04.640 --> 32:06.639
1.80. Final offer.

32:06.640 --> 32:08.359
2.50. And throw in his chain.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.159
Oi! Prick!

32:10.160 --> 32:12.599
Two quid. Take it or leave it.

32:12.600 --> 32:16.599
2.20.

32:27.480 --> 32:29.599
Nice doing business with you.

32:29.600 --> 32:33.599
I've got more
colours if you want them.

32:42.760 --> 32:46.759
Ian. Come on, mate.
Just let me buy you a drink.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.519
Fine.

32:53.520 --> 32:56.159
Venue of my choice.

32:56.160 --> 32:58.959
Gay bar.

32:58.960 --> 33:01.959
Sure. Wherever you want.

33:01.960 --> 33:03.479
See you later then.

33:03.480 --> 33:07.479
Hi. What can I get you?

33:09.520 --> 33:12.279
That wasn't so bad.

33:12.280 --> 33:14.279
We were only trying to catch 'em.

33:14.280 --> 33:16.759
It's more than anyone
else here was doing.

33:16.760 --> 33:20.759
Yvonne didn't make a formal
complaint and the bombers are still
out there, we might still get them.

33:22.240 --> 33:24.199
He's put me back on parking tickets.

33:24.200 --> 33:28.199
I'm not allowed near actual people
till I've learnt to control myself.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.039
Two whole months!

33:31.040 --> 33:35.039
And he turned my transfer down.

33:39.760 --> 33:41.359
Those will be your shifts,
but if you don't want to do it...

33:41.360 --> 33:45.359
Those will be your shifts,
but if you don't want to do it...
I'll do it.

33:48.440 --> 33:49.679
Frank.

33:49.680 --> 33:53.679
Frank.
What? Fuckin' hell, stay away
from me! I'm a mad fucking rapist!

33:53.800 --> 33:56.519
You're only doing this
to get a shot at Monica.

33:56.520 --> 33:59.439
I'll tell you what,
you're not gonna drive us apart

33:59.440 --> 34:01.799
because we are like that.

34:01.800 --> 34:04.759
Big love, in the eyes of God -
can't touch us.

34:04.760 --> 34:06.239
I'm gonna drop the charges.

34:06.240 --> 34:10.239
If you piss off.

34:10.480 --> 34:11.599
You what?

34:11.600 --> 34:14.679
I want Monica back.
You piss off and I'll get her.

34:14.679 --> 34:18.679
You can come back
once she's home with me.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.998
Where am I gonna go that's
gonna give me a fucking bar tab?

34:24.639 --> 34:28.639
I'll give you a grand, but you go
and don't tell Monica I asked you to.

34:29.480 --> 34:31.359
That's the deal.

34:31.360 --> 34:35.359
If you want it, I'll be
waiting with the money tonight.

34:36.600 --> 34:40.599
How much do you love her now, Frank?

34:48.679 --> 34:50.679
Thank God you still had it.

34:50.679 --> 34:54.679
Not a word to your dad
or you're dead.

35:11.280 --> 35:15.119
(TV) '..has increased cafe culture
across the UK.'

35:15.120 --> 35:16.999
I thought you had done another bunk.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.119
I can't just sit around and
wait for you all the time, Frank.

35:20.120 --> 35:23.719
Dad, remember you have the
work focus interview tomorrow.

35:23.720 --> 35:26.959
Do you want me to come with you?

35:26.960 --> 35:30.959
Yeah, thanks love.

35:38.160 --> 35:40.039
Poor little Frank.

35:40.040 --> 35:44.039
You're turning into my own
big bad outlaw?

35:46.160 --> 35:49.519
Do you want to tie me up?

35:49.520 --> 35:53.159
Take me captive in the forest,

35:53.160 --> 35:57.159
torment me with your bow and arrow?

36:04.760 --> 36:07.879
# World, hold on

36:07.880 --> 36:09.679
# Come on... #

36:09.680 --> 36:10.319
Do you think you can handle it?

36:10.320 --> 36:13.319
Do you think you can handle it?
Yeah. Big deal. It's just a club.

36:13.320 --> 36:14.239
Really?

36:14.240 --> 36:18.239
DANCE MUSIC

36:21.320 --> 36:22.959
What can I get you?

36:22.960 --> 36:26.959
It's Ian.
Do you remember from last week?

36:28.320 --> 36:29.239
Sorry?

36:29.240 --> 36:30.919
Sorry?
Couple of beers, please.

36:30.920 --> 36:33.639
Do you want a free one?

36:33.640 --> 36:34.999
Yeah, why not?

36:35.000 --> 36:38.999
Usual terms, boys.
Usual terms. Come on!

36:40.960 --> 36:43.239
Oi!

36:43.240 --> 36:47.239
Hey, what are you doing?! Ian?!

36:57.080 --> 37:01.079
CHEERING AND WHISTLING

37:27.440 --> 37:30.999
Listen, I know you're angry but

37:31.000 --> 37:32.759
your sister, the mad one,

37:32.760 --> 37:36.119
is she still sleeping with that
twat from the construction site?

37:36.120 --> 37:39.639
I'm not fucking
asking her for anything.

37:39.640 --> 37:43.639
I need the Semtex by tonight.

37:49.120 --> 37:53.119
I've no-one left to ask.

37:55.320 --> 37:57.079
You don't need her, you've got me.

37:57.080 --> 38:01.079
Though God knows you don't
deserve me after lying to me.

38:03.480 --> 38:05.279
You didn't look properly, did you?

38:05.280 --> 38:09.279
It was in by the Soda Stream.

38:10.480 --> 38:14.479
I found it.

38:16.720 --> 38:19.359
But that's not...

38:19.360 --> 38:23.359
I...

38:23.360 --> 38:27.359
(LAUGHS)

38:27.400 --> 38:30.679
Oh, my darling! What would I do
without you?

38:30.680 --> 38:33.159
I'm sorry I lied.
I swear I'll never do it again.

38:33.160 --> 38:34.999
You better not!

38:35.000 --> 38:36.719
Have you never lied to me?

38:36.720 --> 38:38.759
Only about my age.

38:38.760 --> 38:42.759
I was only 13 the first time we did
it - I didn't want to put you off.

38:46.040 --> 38:50.039
13?

39:38.480 --> 39:40.079
Frank?

39:40.080 --> 39:44.079
Where are you going?

39:52.400 --> 39:56.399
Monic....

40:01.560 --> 40:04.039
I...

40:04.040 --> 40:07.199
It's this court case.
It's killing me.

40:07.200 --> 40:10.039
I can't put you through
it or the kiddies.

40:10.040 --> 40:11.999
I'm just going to be a burden to you.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.279
So you were just going
to go then, were you?

40:15.280 --> 40:17.279
Into the night...

40:17.280 --> 40:18.359
Go where?

40:18.360 --> 40:21.399
All right, Debbie?
What's going on?

40:21.400 --> 40:22.879
Um, er, nothing...

40:22.880 --> 40:26.879
Your father says he's leaving us
without even saying goodbye.

40:27.920 --> 40:31.559
No, no... No, no.

40:31.560 --> 40:32.919
I'm.... She... It's...

40:32.920 --> 40:36.919
Look, Debbie, it's Norma.

40:39.400 --> 40:43.399
She wants to send me to prison
and I can't, I just can't.

40:44.800 --> 40:47.799
I'm a free spirit.

40:47.800 --> 40:50.599
Prison would...

40:50.600 --> 40:52.239
But you didn't do it.

40:52.240 --> 40:53.439
Yeah, I know but...

40:53.440 --> 40:55.599
Can't you tell Norma
to drop the charges?

40:55.600 --> 40:59.359
No, no. She's just...

40:59.360 --> 41:01.479
It's not going to happen, is it?
She's got me by the...

41:01.480 --> 41:04.359
It's not going to happen, is it?
She's got me by the...
Let's see about that.

41:04.360 --> 41:06.759
Monica!

41:06.760 --> 41:09.519
Monica!

41:09.520 --> 41:13.519
Monica!

41:19.040 --> 41:21.079
Yeah, I knew you'd...

41:21.080 --> 41:22.199
Monica?

41:22.200 --> 41:26.199
Now, pumpkin. I've come to ask you
to drop the charges against Frank.

41:27.160 --> 41:29.999
Monica, he tried to rape me.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.039
Norma, he's hasn't got it in him.

41:33.040 --> 41:36.319
Besides which, he is the kids'
dad and if he ever went to prison

41:36.320 --> 41:40.319
I could never forgive you.
Let alone do anything else.

41:43.520 --> 41:47.519
So, do we have a deal?

41:49.000 --> 41:51.239
Oh, what's that?

41:51.240 --> 41:55.239
Is that money to buy the sunglasses
and shoes to go with the jacket?

41:55.960 --> 41:58.279
Oh, bless.

41:58.280 --> 42:02.279
Love you, pumpkin.

42:06.320 --> 42:10.319
Got a present for you.

42:12.360 --> 42:15.359
What a bastard.

42:15.360 --> 42:17.519
Are you looking for this?

42:17.520 --> 42:21.519
Yeah, thanks. (LAUGHS)

42:22.440 --> 42:24.119
How much do you love yourself?

42:24.120 --> 42:27.319
You still reckon I've got a
problem with gay men then?

42:27.320 --> 42:29.399
Yeah. You can't get them off you.

42:29.400 --> 42:33.399
He's a sound guy, actually.
And he gave me his number.

42:33.680 --> 42:35.439
Yeah!

42:35.440 --> 42:36.399
Jammy bastard!

42:36.400 --> 42:40.119
So how much do you think
that's worth then?

42:40.120 --> 42:41.319
Oh, piss off!

42:41.320 --> 42:45.319
Yeah! Come on!

42:49.720 --> 42:53.719
Syngenesophobia. Fear of relatives,
Only Monica's, though.

42:54.040 --> 42:56.399
Bastards, the lot of them.

42:56.400 --> 42:59.799
Well, except Carl maybe.

42:59.800 --> 43:01.759
He's all right.

43:01.760 --> 43:04.319
Can you keep the noise down?

43:04.320 --> 43:06.839
Little Liam is quite sweet.

43:06.840 --> 43:08.159
Fuck off!

43:08.160 --> 43:11.959
Pricks! Except when he's putting
dead mice up your exhaust.
