20:06.171 --> 20:07.137
How's she holding up?

20:07.139 --> 20:11.074
- Sir, every tunnel is flooded
except for the reducer pipe.

20:11.076 --> 20:13.009
- The pinch point!

20:13.011 --> 20:15.645
- Hmm.
Is that bad?

20:17.815 --> 20:19.516
both:
Huh?

20:20.251 --> 20:21.851
[both whimpering]

20:21.853 --> 20:25.222
- Gaskets blown,
manifold mangled,

20:25.224 --> 20:26.923
backflow everywhere!

20:26.925 --> 20:28.258
- Oh, you're overreacting.

20:28.260 --> 20:31.795
- You flushed it all away,
Crupski!

20:31.797 --> 20:32.929
You two better hope

20:32.931 --> 20:37.834
that fail-safe
I installed works.

20:40.972 --> 20:44.574
[all screaming]

20:45.076 --> 20:48.845
- Hot dogs, popcorn.

20:48.847 --> 20:50.647
Snorkles?

20:50.649 --> 20:51.648
[all screaming]

20:51.650 --> 20:56.186
- Good thing today was
Free Ax Day at the stadium.

20:57.755 --> 20:58.989
[grunts]

20:58.991 --> 21:01.992
[growls]

21:06.697 --> 21:08.064
[grunts]

21:12.803 --> 21:16.206
[all screaming]

21:21.912 --> 21:23.280
[all gasp]

21:23.282 --> 21:25.849
- [grunting]

21:25.851 --> 21:30.020
This is what you get
when so-called fishkind,

21:30.022 --> 21:34.157
in all its hubris and ignorance,
stoops so low

21:34.159 --> 21:37.961
as to cut corners
in its plumbing system.

21:37.963 --> 21:43.033
Extinction is the result
of being cheap!

21:43.035 --> 21:44.668
- What a bunch of malarkey.

21:44.670 --> 21:49.906
- At least we didn't waken
the Great Sewer Snake.

21:51.275 --> 21:52.676
Check that.

21:52.678 --> 21:54.611
[all screaming]

21:54.613 --> 21:58.048
[snake roars]

22:00.117 --> 22:00.884
Ah!

22:00.886 --> 22:03.953
[snake roars]
Ah!

22:06.257 --> 22:07.757
- Uh-oh.

22:07.958 --> 22:13.663
Whoa! Ooh! Whoo-hoo!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

22:20.237 --> 22:22.138
[all gasp]

22:23.674 --> 22:27.677
- Hey, everybody,
the cook's back from toilet.

22:27.679 --> 22:30.080
- Who's hungry?

22:30.082 --> 22:33.683
[all screaming]
