01:15.076 --> 01:16.703
Come on, go, 90, 90-

01:18.455 --> 01:19.289
Move, move, move.

01:51.946 --> 01:53.114
<i>Get down! Get down!</i>

02:12.133 --> 02:13.635
<i>Cease fire!
Hold your fire!</i>

02:33.238 --> 02:34.364
<i>Go!</i>

05:39.841 --> 05:41.009
Hunting.

05:41.092 --> 05:43.011
I am going hunting.

08:16.581 --> 08:17.415
Ow.

08:47.236 --> 08:49.530
<i>Another day and
another round of violence</i>

08:49.614 --> 08:51.657
<i>in Syria on Saturday.</i>

08:51.741 --> 08:54.577
<i>Fighting in the northern city
of Atma has raged for days</i>

08:54.660 --> 08:57.538
<i>causing widespread destruction
and casualties that have now</i>

08:57.622 --> 09:01.459
<i>topped 35,000,
with many of those civilians.</i>

09:01.542 --> 09:03.586
<i>The addition of more troops
in what are sure to be</i>

09:03.669 --> 09:06.505
<i>even bloodier battles ahead
has fueled worries</i>

09:06.589 --> 09:10.551
<i>within the rebel ranks
and around the world.</i>

09:10.635 --> 09:13.679
<i>Talks in Washington calling
for the arming of insurgents</i>

09:13.763 --> 09:15.890
<i>in Syria.</i>

09:15.973 --> 09:18.267
<i>We should start
considering all options,</i>

09:18.351 --> 09:20.436
<i>including arming
the opposition.</i>

09:20.519 --> 09:22.730
<i>Experts say
arming the fighting groups</i>

09:22.813 --> 09:24.690
<i>among the opposition
is a sure way</i>

09:24.774 --> 09:27.902
<i>to drag the country
into a protracted civil war.</i>

09:27.985 --> 09:29.987
<i>It will also
further marginalize</i>

09:30.071 --> 09:33.157
<i>those in the opposition who
have advocated non-violence</i>

09:33.241 --> 09:35.243
<i>or to advance
political strategy.</i>

11:23.184 --> 11:26.187
<i>Please leave a
message after the beep.</i>

11:26.270 --> 11:28.814
<i>Hey, Dad, it's Chris-
Did you get' him?</i>

11:28.939 --> 11:31.776
<i>No, I go! the machine.
Why don't you fry his cell?</i>

11:31.859 --> 11:34.612
<i>'Cause he doesn't have a cell.
You could email him.</i>

11:34.695 --> 11:37.281
<i>Or a computer.</i>

11:37.365 --> 11:39.742
<i>So I'll just leave a message-</i>

11:39.825 --> 11:41.660
Hey, buddy.
How's it going?

11:41.744 --> 11:45.081
Hey. It's good.
It's great.

11:45.164 --> 11:48.125
How about you? You been
radio silent for a while.

11:48.209 --> 11:50.336
Just, you know,
keeping busy.

11:50.419 --> 11:53.047
As usual.

11:53.130 --> 11:54.757
<i>So, hey, listen.</i>

11:54.840 --> 11:56.425
<i>I don't know
if you saw the invite,</i>

11:56.509 --> 11:58.719
<i>but tomorrow's
Matthew's baptism.</i>

11:58.803 --> 12:00.930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:01.013 --> 12:02.932
<i>Starting him early, huh?
What's that?</i>

12:03.015 --> 12:05.684
Nothing.
Just, yeah, that's great.

12:05.768 --> 12:08.687
That'll be a great day.

12:08.771 --> 12:12.817
You know, we were hoping you
were going to make it down.

12:12.900 --> 12:17.405
To be honest,
it's tough for me tomorrow.

12:17.488 --> 12:20.282
Come on, Dad.
What do you got going on?

12:20.366 --> 12:23.494
<i>Just, you know, odds and ends.</i>

12:23.577 --> 12:25.913
Look, if it's
the church thing,

12:25.996 --> 12:27.790
you could just come
to the party afterwards.

12:27.873 --> 12:29.250
You don't even
have to wear a tie.

12:29.333 --> 12:30.668
That sweetens the deal.

12:34.463 --> 12:36.006
He coming?

12:36.090 --> 12:39.218
Yeah, Dad.
He's going to be there.

12:39.301 --> 12:41.679
<i>Mom's been married
to the guy for 20 years,</i>

12:41.762 --> 12:44.056
<i>you've said about as many words to him.
Yeah, well...</i>

12:44.140 --> 12:47.184
Look, like I said, son...

12:49.019 --> 12:51.355
things have been keeping me
a little busy up here.

12:53.399 --> 12:57.236
Right. Well...

12:57.319 --> 13:01.824
Won't bug you about it anymore.
You're not bugging me.

13:01.907 --> 13:04.410
No, you're not bugging me.

13:04.493 --> 13:07.371
Well, hey, maybe we'll drive
up sometime, surprise you.

13:07.455 --> 13:11.333
Yeah, well, better call first.

13:11.417 --> 13:13.377
Right.

13:13.461 --> 13:15.588
Okay. Well...

13:15.671 --> 13:17.006
<i>Leave you to it.</i>

13:19.758 --> 13:21.010
Goodbye, Dad.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.345
Bye, Chris.

13:26.348 --> 13:27.558
Bye.

13:37.735 --> 13:38.819
Ah...

13:41.030 --> 13:42.072
Fuck!

13:58.088 --> 13:59.381
Shit.

14:21.362 --> 14:23.280
Oh.

14:23.364 --> 14:25.574
God damn.

14:25.658 --> 14:26.951
<i>Oh, Shit.</i>

14:31.330 --> 14:32.498
Ah, shit.

14:48.097 --> 14:50.558
<i>You got engine trouble?</i>

14:53.185 --> 14:56.522
Long way from home, aren't you?
Well, that is the whole idea.

14:56.605 --> 14:58.983
I am on sabbatical
for my health.

15:01.193 --> 15:02.987
Yeah, well,
good luck on that.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.322
May I take a look? I got
it covered, thanks.

15:05.406 --> 15:06.782
It's no trouble.

15:06.865 --> 15:09.618
I just have
to tow it into town.

15:09.702 --> 15:11.704
But that is
30, 40 miles, no?

15:11.787 --> 15:15.040
Please allow me. I drove hack
in London for seven years

15:15.124 --> 15:18.460
and I had no choice but to become
expert on British automobiles.

15:18.544 --> 15:20.337
Really, I don't need any help.
Thank you.

15:20.421 --> 15:22.006
Okay. Okay.

15:28.012 --> 15:28.846
Hey.

15:30.514 --> 15:31.599
Sir.

15:33.475 --> 15:35.894
I just...

15:35.978 --> 15:39.690
I get this shooting
pain in my leg.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.108
Comes and goes.

15:41.191 --> 15:43.235
Always puts me in a bad mood.

15:49.950 --> 15:51.160
Try it.

15:55.789 --> 15:57.416
Ah, you got to be kidding me.
God damn it!

15:57.541 --> 16:01.003
Patience. I'm
trying to revive car.

16:01.086 --> 16:02.880
I don't want to have
to do the same for you.

16:02.963 --> 16:06.008
Well, I should've
just towed it in.

16:06.091 --> 16:07.468
Okay, once more,
if you please.

16:10.888 --> 16:12.056
Yeah.

16:12.848 --> 16:13.807
Ah.

16:14.683 --> 16:16.393
Well...

16:16.477 --> 16:19.396
You're a miracle worker.
Thank you.

16:21.690 --> 16:24.735
Body of Christ visited
in the filter housing.

16:24.818 --> 16:26.695
I don't like American cars,
very finicky.

16:26.779 --> 16:29.740
You have to be extremely
vigilant about maintenance.

16:29.823 --> 16:32.159
You have to listen
to every little thing.

16:32.242 --> 16:34.078
The shooting pain in my
leg is just killing me.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.580
I just got to get- Okay.
My sermon is over.

16:36.664 --> 16:39.083
Drug store will be closed
if I don't head out soon.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.001
Appreciate the help, mister?

16:41.085 --> 16:42.252
Emil

16:42.336 --> 16:44.797
Ben.
Benjamin Ford.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.382
Take it easy.

16:46.465 --> 16:47.341
You, too.

16:48.342 --> 16:49.760
Take it easy.

17:41.979 --> 17:44.064
You sure you're all
right out here?

17:44.148 --> 17:47.151
Where I come from, this is a
walk in the park. Where is that?

17:47.234 --> 17:50.446
I'm sure you would not
have heard of this place.

17:50.529 --> 17:52.740
I'm-
just leave it at that.

17:52.823 --> 17:54.575
Try me.

17:54.658 --> 17:56.744
Small village, Lukomir.
Oh, yeah, Bosnia.

17:56.827 --> 17:59.246
I was stationed in Bradina.

17:59.329 --> 18:02.416
Yeah. Well, then,
we are brothers.

18:02.499 --> 18:03.542
I don't know about that.

18:03.625 --> 18:05.836
I mean in arms.

18:05.919 --> 18:08.172
Let me shake your hand again.

18:08.255 --> 18:10.507
Yeah, small world.

18:10.591 --> 18:12.634
I have kept you long.
That's okay.

18:12.718 --> 18:15.179
The clock is ticking. It's too
dangerous to be driving anyway.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.222
I think I'm going to head back.
I'm going to ride it out.

18:17.306 --> 18:19.725
You're welcome
to join me if you want.

18:19.850 --> 18:22.853
But I would hate to be bother. I could
lie to you, say it's the Christian in me

18:22.936 --> 18:25.355
who wants you along, but truth
is if anything happens to you,

18:25.439 --> 18:27.816
it's going to come back
and bite me in the ass.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.818
There's a word for it.

18:29.902 --> 18:31.904
I believe it is karma.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.419
Few more minutes.

18:48.712 --> 18:50.255
Winchester, no?

18:50.339 --> 18:53.133
1873, the gun
that won the West.

18:53.217 --> 18:54.718
Yeah, you hunter like me.

18:54.802 --> 18:57.304
Yeah, every now and then.

18:57.387 --> 18:59.640
I don't use that.

18:59.723 --> 19:00.974
I use this.

19:04.561 --> 19:06.230
Evens the odds
a little bit.

19:06.313 --> 19:08.023
I wholeheartedly agree.

19:09.608 --> 19:11.819
You know,
I must confess,

19:11.902 --> 19:13.487
I did not come halfway
around the world

19:13.570 --> 19:15.989
just for mountain air.

19:16.073 --> 19:18.158
I came for trophy.
Oh, whitetail?

19:18.283 --> 19:23.205
Elk. Elk, they gave
you a tag, lucky dog.

19:23.288 --> 19:25.791
What'd you do, pull some strings
with Fish and Wildlife?

19:25.874 --> 19:29.920
No patience. You know, 18 months
ago I applied for license

19:30.003 --> 19:32.047
for five bull.

19:32.130 --> 19:35.008
Perhaps you come
with me tomorrow.

19:35.092 --> 19:36.844
No, really.

19:36.927 --> 19:40.430
The storm will be over
and the air will be clear

19:40.514 --> 19:42.558
and maybe, who knows,
you get lucky,

19:42.641 --> 19:44.810
you add another head
to your collection.

19:44.893 --> 19:46.728
Well, what are you using?
I use this.

19:46.812 --> 19:47.896
I'll show you.

19:54.278 --> 19:56.947
Here.
Jesus Christ, buddy.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.615
You fight
in the Indian Wars?

19:58.699 --> 20:01.910
No, this is the same bow
I used as a boy.

20:01.994 --> 20:06.039
You know, it's, gets
very clean strong draw.

20:07.749 --> 20:11.211
Not jerky like yours.
Well, mine won't snap.

20:11.295 --> 20:14.715
Any bow can snap.
That's fiberglass.

20:14.798 --> 20:16.842
I worked with fiberglass
in factory.

20:16.967 --> 20:20.637
That was after the war? No, before the war.
Old soldier like you.

20:20.721 --> 20:22.931
But sometimes
it is difficult

20:23.015 --> 20:25.976
to know when to leave
the battlefield, you know?

20:27.978 --> 20:30.147
You're talking
about the fiberglass.

20:30.230 --> 20:34.234
The tiny beer bubbles
find their way into the malt

20:34.318 --> 20:37.154
during
the manufacturing process.

20:37.237 --> 20:40.157
And then each time
you pull the string back,

20:40.240 --> 20:43.327
the fiberglass
weakens bit by bit.

20:43.410 --> 20:47.039
One day, you are tracking
your quarry through the grass,

20:47.122 --> 20:51.501
and the rocks, and the mud,
and the rain, and the snow,

20:51.585 --> 20:53.587
and finally
you see your prize bull

20:53.670 --> 20:56.089
right in the sights
and snap!

20:56.173 --> 20:57.466
It breaks.

21:00.469 --> 21:01.970
You're a weird duck.

21:02.971 --> 21:03.680
<i>Hmm.</i>

21:06.391 --> 21:08.268
What is this photographer?

21:08.352 --> 21:11.355
Oh, I did those.
Really?

21:11.438 --> 21:12.481
You're a photographer?

21:12.564 --> 21:14.608
Yeah.

21:14.691 --> 21:18.195
What is this one? Well, that's
the old church up in God's Peak.

21:18.278 --> 21:20.948
God's Peak.
Hmm.

21:21.031 --> 21:22.282
Reminds me of home.

21:24.493 --> 21:27.120
Oh, no, please, I'm fine.
Oh, you got to try it.

21:27.204 --> 21:31.041
I have more than I need,
and it doesn't keep real well.

21:31.124 --> 21:32.668
Or not.
It's a free country.

21:32.751 --> 21:33.543
Okay.

21:34.878 --> 21:36.254
If you insist.

21:53.522 --> 21:55.565
This is good. Good,huh?
Told you.

21:55.649 --> 21:57.484
It's delicious.

21:57.567 --> 22:01.071
Oh. It almost
slipped my mind.

22:01.154 --> 22:02.739
<i>I have something
to return the favor.</i>

22:10.789 --> 22:12.749
For the true hunter.

22:12.833 --> 22:15.419
It's too late for me now.
Oh, come on.

22:15.502 --> 22:18.880
You know, you did not
have aspirin today, okay?

22:18.964 --> 22:21.341
So, do not think
of it as a drink.

22:21.425 --> 22:25.178
Think of it
as pain killer.

22:25.262 --> 22:28.140
I always drink
with friend.

22:28.223 --> 22:29.599
Never alone.

22:29.683 --> 22:32.269
I have many rules,
most I break.

22:32.352 --> 22:34.312
But never that one.

22:34.396 --> 22:38.025
<i>So, Zivjeli.
Live long.</i>

22:38.108 --> 22:39.401
Zivjeli.

22:42.779 --> 22:44.948
<i>I'm felling you,
these women are beautiful.</i>

22:45.032 --> 22:48.201
They fuck all night,
I'm not kidding you.

22:48.285 --> 22:52.330
Okay, now, your turn.
You tell me stories.

22:52.456 --> 22:54.499
War stories. I want to hear this.
War stories?

22:54.583 --> 22:56.835
Yes. Most of those aren't true.

22:56.960 --> 23:01.131
Most, but some. Ones that are, why
would anyone want to talk about it?

23:01.214 --> 23:03.717
How else do you
keep the best life?

23:03.800 --> 23:05.677
The past is dead.
Let's keep it that way.

23:05.761 --> 23:09.222
No, see, now I see the
difference between you and me.

23:09.306 --> 23:11.892
You drink
to forget the past,

23:11.975 --> 23:14.186
I drink to remember.

23:14.269 --> 23:17.856
I don't remember much,
but this I do remember.

23:20.192 --> 23:23.403
The more booze
you brought over there,

23:23.487 --> 23:25.614
there was plenty of blood.

23:25.697 --> 23:26.907
To the war.

23:30.952 --> 23:32.621
Oh, come on, Benjamin.

23:32.704 --> 23:36.083
Is there not anything
you missed about the war?

23:36.166 --> 23:37.250
Only to not miss it.

23:37.334 --> 23:38.960
But why you say this?

23:39.044 --> 23:41.254
It was nothing but like
cakewalk for you, no?

23:41.338 --> 23:44.758
You don't have any idea what the
war was like for me, buddy.

23:46.968 --> 23:51.348
I misspoke. What I simply meant
is that most American soldiers

23:51.431 --> 23:54.434
did nothing more
but lob missiles into Bosnia

23:54.518 --> 23:57.604
from the safety of ships
floating in the Mediterranean.

23:57.687 --> 23:58.563
Most, not all.

24:06.029 --> 24:08.532
Three drinks.
Say again?

24:08.615 --> 24:11.827
My people say
we love Americans

24:11.910 --> 24:15.163
for three drinks,
but we've had five.

24:15.247 --> 24:17.749
And I still love you.

24:17.833 --> 24:19.292
Hey. Come on.

24:19.376 --> 24:22.087
<i>Let's have six.
Maybe seven.</i>

24:22.170 --> 24:24.673
Two more, we'll forget
we even had this conversation.

24:28.426 --> 24:32.472
<i>.67 Then Billy Joe reached
for his gun to draw ﬂ</i>

24:32.556 --> 24:37.894
♫ But the stranger drew his gun
and fired before he even saw ♫

24:37.978 --> 24:40.689
Billy Joe;
fell to the; flour

24:40.772 --> 24:43.191
♫ the crowd
all gathered round ♫

24:43.275 --> 24:47.404
And wandered
at his final words;

24:47.487 --> 24:51.741
<i>D Don't take your guns
to town, son D</i>

24:51.825 --> 24:55.203
♫ Leave your guns
at home, Bill ♫

24:55.287 --> 25:00.667
♫ Don't take your guns to town ♫

25:00.750 --> 25:02.043
To the man in black.

25:05.005 --> 25:07.174
Love this fucking song.

25:11.720 --> 25:13.555
What?
The shooting pain?

25:13.638 --> 25:16.266
Shrapnel,
finding its way out.

25:16.349 --> 25:18.935
Why don't you
just get this removed?

25:19.019 --> 25:21.980
Well, doctor says my choice.

25:22.063 --> 25:24.357
I hate hospitals anyway.

25:24.441 --> 25:25.775
Maybe you like pain.

25:27.319 --> 25:31.031
Sometimes things
become part of you.

25:31.114 --> 25:32.657
Whether you like it or not.

25:38.872 --> 25:42.751
What is this?
Is this a picture of baby?

25:42.834 --> 25:47.339
My grandson gets
baptized tomorrow morning.

25:47.422 --> 25:49.174
I don't think
I'm going to make it.

25:49.257 --> 25:50.926
I haven't even met the kid yet.

25:51.009 --> 25:53.720
Yeah, but, you know,
he sent this invitation,

25:53.803 --> 25:55.388
I'm sure
he wants you to go.

25:55.472 --> 25:58.725
Well, my wife,
well, my ex-wife,

25:58.808 --> 26:02.312
she's going to bring her
new- hell, I say new,

26:02.395 --> 26:06.274
but she's been married,
what, going on 20 years now.

26:06.358 --> 26:09.945
And you know the kicker? Kicker?
What's "kicker?"

26:10.028 --> 26:12.072
Suprise.
Surprise, yes.

26:12.155 --> 26:16.159
The new guy, he was
best man at our wedding.

26:16.243 --> 26:20.163
Oh, mother fucker.
You're kidding.

26:20.247 --> 26:21.998
Yup.

26:22.082 --> 26:23.833
He's all right.
He ain't a bad guy.

26:23.917 --> 26:26.753
He's been there for my son.

26:26.836 --> 26:29.506
He's been actually more
of a father than I have.

26:29.589 --> 26:34.552
I've been, you know,
away and here and there.

26:34.636 --> 26:36.137
You know, just...

26:38.056 --> 26:40.850
<i>Oh, come on, Ben.</i>

26:40.934 --> 26:45.939
Let me read something for you.
You test my German. Okay.

26:46.022 --> 26:49.401
<i>It is the hunter's honor
that he protects</i>

26:49.484 --> 26:53.530
and preserves his game,
hunts sportsmanlike,

26:53.613 --> 26:58.368
and honors the creator
and his creatures.

27:01.663 --> 27:06.501
Benjamin, did you honor
the creator in him?

27:06.584 --> 27:08.878
I didn't kill him.
You didn't?

27:08.962 --> 27:12.048
I haven't killed anything in 20 years.
You're joking.

27:12.173 --> 27:16.428
No. Everything you see here inside, outside, all bullshit.
Bullshit, what do you mean-

27:16.511 --> 27:18.179
Everything here,
bullshit car,

27:18.263 --> 27:20.974
bullshit house,
bullshit fiberglass bow,

27:21.057 --> 27:24.853
bullshit heads on a wall, it's all bullshit.
Come on, I would love to have this.

27:24.936 --> 27:26.896
Want to hear
something pathetic?

27:26.980 --> 27:29.649
This was all here when I bought this place.
You're joking.

27:29.733 --> 27:33.903
No. Furnished with rustic interior
design elements. Oh, my God.

27:33.987 --> 27:38.325
That's what the listing said. That's it. It's all bullshit.
That is not the man you are.

27:38.408 --> 27:41.244
I mean I grew up in a place
like this, but not as big

27:41.328 --> 27:44.164
and actually not as fancy,
but it was, you know,

27:44.247 --> 27:48.585
it was the real deal, mountains,
trees, hung out with my dad.

27:48.668 --> 27:51.796
Hey, I'll show you something.
You'll get a kick out of this.

27:58.470 --> 27:59.929
That was my dad's.
What is this?

28:00.013 --> 28:03.016
Silver star
for gallantry in action.

28:03.099 --> 28:06.436
But does he have some war
stories to tell, huh? Oh, yeah.

28:06.519 --> 28:09.439
I fought three different wars,
four different countries,

28:09.522 --> 28:11.441
still couldn't get
one of these.

28:11.524 --> 28:12.984
Really?

28:13.068 --> 28:17.364
No prize for Ben.
That's not good.

28:17.447 --> 28:20.617
All the good things you did,
you know, why not-

28:20.700 --> 28:23.411
I remember the first time
we went hunting,

28:23.495 --> 28:25.497
I told him
I wanted to use his bow.

28:25.580 --> 28:29.209
He said, "You're not strong
enough to draw the string back. "

28:29.292 --> 28:31.878
He taught you
how to use this bow.

28:31.961 --> 28:34.047
Yeah, he taught me how to make a bow.
Oh, make a bow.

28:34.130 --> 28:37.133
He could do anything with his hands.
Oh, yeah, he was... Whoa.

28:37.217 --> 28:38.635
He could do it all.

28:38.718 --> 28:40.220
I hit something
the first time out,

28:40.303 --> 28:43.014
medium sized bow,
right in the heart.

28:43.098 --> 28:44.808
"Eagle eye," that's
what my dad called me.

28:44.891 --> 28:47.852
Ah, Eagle eye. Yeah.

28:51.981 --> 28:53.858
Okay, you know...

28:53.983 --> 28:58.530
It's time for me to be roughing it again.
Are you sure?

28:58.655 --> 29:05.745
I've got a spare room in the back- No, you
have been very kind, you've been very generous.

29:05.829 --> 29:10.166
My offer still stands,
tomorrow at dawn,

29:10.250 --> 29:13.586
the west fork,
and I'll tell you what.

29:13.670 --> 29:16.923
I even give you the first shot.
I appreciate it.

29:17.006 --> 29:20.510
I got lots of things to do tomorrow.
Nice to have you over.

29:20.593 --> 29:22.137
You get good sleep.
You think about it.

29:22.220 --> 29:23.555
Maybe you change
your mind.

29:23.638 --> 29:25.473
My thanks to you.
Thank you.

29:25.598 --> 29:28.435
Okay. Goodnight, Benjamin.
You too, you too.

29:28.518 --> 29:32.313
Have a good sleep.
You too, Emil.

29:54.794 --> 29:56.963
<i>Careful, it's slippery.</i>

29:58.798 --> 30:00.300
So, how do you feel?

30:00.383 --> 30:02.135
Got a hangover,
bouncing back.

30:02.218 --> 30:03.678
Not so much for me.

30:03.761 --> 30:06.556
You're used
to it, I'm sure.

30:06.681 --> 30:09.601
Mountainman, Davy Crockett.
You know that?

30:09.684 --> 30:11.394
I do. You
heard over there?

30:11.478 --> 30:14.731
As a boy. You
are Davy Crockett.

30:14.814 --> 30:18.735
I never go this way.
Mountainmen.

30:22.655 --> 30:24.532
You go up
in the meadow over there.

30:24.616 --> 30:26.451
I've had good luck there.

30:26.534 --> 30:30.079
I'm going up to the deer stand.
Take this.

30:30.163 --> 30:34.000
It's voice activated. Channel three.
Put it on channel three.

30:34.083 --> 30:36.836
Testing. Testing.
One, two. One, two.

30:36.920 --> 30:38.755
It's good stuff.

30:38.838 --> 30:40.089
Testing. Testing.

30:46.429 --> 30:48.473
Did you ever hear the one
about this old Italian guy

30:48.556 --> 30:51.267
wants to confess
to local padre?

30:51.351 --> 30:53.520
So he slides open the little
door in the confessional.

30:53.603 --> 30:56.481
He says, "Father, forgive
me for I have sinned.

30:56.564 --> 30:58.858
<i>"Back during the war, there
was this beautiful woman.</i>

30:58.942 --> 31:02.403
"She came to my house and asked
me to protect her from the Nazis.

31:02.487 --> 31:04.822
"So I hid her up my attic. "

31:04.906 --> 31:07.700
The priest says, "That's a
wonderful thing you did, my son.

31:07.784 --> 31:10.119
"There's no need to confess. "

31:10.203 --> 31:12.539
And the old man says,
"But it gets worse.

31:12.622 --> 31:17.252
"She started to repay me with
sexual favors like blowjobs. "

31:22.840 --> 31:27.720
So the priest says, "Fear not, my
son, war makes sinners of us all.

31:27.804 --> 31:29.889
"You are forgiven. "
The old man says,

31:29.973 --> 31:35.061
"Well, that's a great burden
off my mind. A great burden.

31:35.186 --> 31:38.940
<i>"But I have one more question. "
Do you see him?</i>

31:39.023 --> 31:41.442
<i>Do you have a shot?</i>

31:45.530 --> 31:47.115
Yeah, I'll try.

31:54.622 --> 31:56.332
<i>Take him.</i>

31:56.416 --> 31:59.627
<i>He's nothing
but a bag of meal'</i>

31:59.711 --> 32:02.922
<i>and flesh and tendon.</i>

32:05.967 --> 32:07.552
<i>Put him out
of his misery.</i>

32:11.973 --> 32:13.933
<i>Take the shot,
Eagle Eye.</i>

32:17.562 --> 32:21.566
You want him, he's yours.

32:21.649 --> 32:22.609
<i>I know.</i>

32:25.194 --> 32:26.779
What the hell was that?

32:26.863 --> 32:28.615
You just spooked him.

32:28.698 --> 32:35.121
<i>Colonel Ford,
you've changed.</i>

32:35.204 --> 32:37.957
Kovac?

32:38.041 --> 32:40.793
<i>You pulled the
trigger back in Menacha.</i>

32:42.629 --> 32:44.881
How'd you know
I was in Menacha?

32:44.964 --> 32:46.841
<i>Because I was there, too.</i>

32:50.136 --> 32:51.095
Fuck.

33:04.651 --> 33:07.111
<i>It's the hunter's
honor that he protects</i>

33:07.195 --> 33:10.156
<i>and preserves his game,
hunts sportsmanlike,</i>

33:10.239 --> 33:12.700
<i>and honors
the creator's creatures.</i>

33:12.784 --> 33:16.079
You're not Bosnian. What the
fuck do you want from me?

33:16.162 --> 33:18.498
<i>I always wonder who
would win in a fair fight,</i>

33:18.581 --> 33:22.293
<i>both of us properly armed.
Fuck!</i>

33:22.377 --> 33:25.672
<i>Two men alone
in the wilderness.</i>

33:25.755 --> 33:26.381
War.

33:27.465 --> 33:29.050
Distilled.

33:29.133 --> 33:31.678
My bow is broken.
This ain't a fair fight.

33:31.761 --> 33:34.305
<i>You of all
people should know,</i>

33:34.389 --> 33:35.932
<i>war is not fair.</i>

34:11.717 --> 34:12.342
Fuck!

34:58.514 --> 34:59.682
Fuck.

36:44.120 --> 36:46.163
I told you,
I wanted a trophy.

36:46.247 --> 36:48.332
Fuck you!
Ah.

36:48.416 --> 36:51.544
I warned you
about the air bubbles

36:51.627 --> 36:55.423
in the fiberglass, first
sign of trouble, and snap!

36:55.506 --> 36:58.593
What, you pissed off about the war or something?
Did something happen to you?

36:58.676 --> 37:01.429
You killed my friend, I killed your
friend, that's what it's about.

37:01.512 --> 37:04.765
I made peace with my sins.
It's over. No.

37:04.849 --> 37:09.103
The war will never be over. Why
don't you just shoot me, then?

37:09.186 --> 37:11.856
Instead of this running around
hiding bullshit. Just shoot me!

37:11.939 --> 37:13.941
Oh, come on, Benjamin.

37:14.025 --> 37:19.196
I just want
to shoot the shit.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.324
Shoot the shit? Yeah, it's
how you say this, right?

37:21.407 --> 37:23.868
Shoot the shit. Shoot the shit?
You just shot me.

37:23.951 --> 37:27.496
What the fuck are you- I know, but I had to.
I had no choice.

37:27.580 --> 37:30.750
I could've shot you in the heart
or the head, but I didn't.

37:30.833 --> 37:33.294
I could've killed you.

37:33.377 --> 37:35.922
So, come out to sit.
We'll talk like gentlemen.

37:44.013 --> 37:45.973
Come on, sit over here.

37:46.057 --> 37:47.058
Sit down.

37:56.233 --> 37:57.443
<i>Benjamin.</i>

37:59.904 --> 38:02.031
What are you,
you going to hang me now?

38:04.200 --> 38:05.534
Pull up your pants leg.

38:15.127 --> 38:17.254
<i>There's a stake
on the end of that rope.</i>

38:17.380 --> 38:20.174
I want you to put it through the
hole in your leg and tie it. What?

38:20.257 --> 38:22.218
Put the stake through
the hole in the calf.

38:27.974 --> 38:30.184
<i>Okay.</i>

38:30.267 --> 38:31.519
Let me see!

38:57.336 --> 38:58.921
Tie it, please.

39:09.390 --> 39:10.307
Tight.

39:25.322 --> 39:26.866
Don't worry.

39:26.949 --> 39:29.285
The calf muscle is very strong.

39:29.368 --> 39:33.706
You can hang like this for days
without tearing muscle.

39:33.789 --> 39:37.293
<i>Okay, you are the old Italian
man- I am the priest.</i>

39:37.376 --> 39:39.545
And this is our confession.

39:39.628 --> 39:42.048
So, what are your sins, my son?

39:42.131 --> 39:46.802
And you say something like, "Oh,
bless me, father, for I have sinned.

39:46.886 --> 39:50.931
"It's been so and so many days since my
last confession, and these are my sins. "

39:51.015 --> 39:54.143
Now, you know what that means to confess, no?
Of course you do.

39:54.226 --> 39:57.980
But, you, you say things like,
"Oh, my wife left me.

39:58.064 --> 40:01.108
"Oh, my son calls
different man 'father. '

40:01.192 --> 40:03.319
"Oh, I miss my dear old daddy. "

40:03.402 --> 40:07.740
But I go to confession every week,
even more if I find the time.

40:07.823 --> 40:10.201
But you go to retreat
in the mountain,

40:10.326 --> 40:13.329
did you think you could forget the past?
What do you want from me?

40:13.412 --> 40:15.331
I want real confession!

40:15.414 --> 40:18.918
You put bullet in my back
and you left me for dead.

40:19.001 --> 40:21.962
And now for years
you run from the truth.

40:22.046 --> 40:25.841
And I carried the pain alone.
But no more!

40:25.925 --> 40:28.761
So, now it is time
to spill your guts.

40:28.844 --> 40:33.057
Now, you know American Indians
spilled one's guts to reveal

40:33.140 --> 40:35.643
one's most intimate secrets.

40:35.726 --> 40:39.688
I want you
to spill your guts to me.

40:39.772 --> 40:42.983
Or I will spill them for you.

40:43.067 --> 40:45.569
Want good cut?

40:45.653 --> 40:48.948
Like this, and everything spills
out on the ground. Please, stop.

40:49.031 --> 40:51.867
You live alone. This is good,
because I want you to see

40:51.951 --> 40:56.247
all the little creatures will come
down and nibble on your insides.

44:09.106 --> 44:10.524
<i>You'll be late.</i>

44:13.485 --> 44:19.450
Looks like you missed
your little nephew's baptism.

44:19.533 --> 44:23.996
<i>But you would rather be up
here with me, wouldn't you?</i>

44:26.290 --> 44:28.417
Do you believe
in God, Benjamin?

44:28.500 --> 44:31.337
Who gives a shit?

44:31.420 --> 44:33.589
Did you hear what I said?
Fuck you.

44:33.672 --> 44:34.548
FUCK you!

44:37.134 --> 44:38.344
<i>I believe in him.</i>

44:38.427 --> 44:41.055
I know he exists.

44:41.138 --> 44:42.222
And I'll tell you why.

44:44.224 --> 44:48.437
<i>It was walking home
from the factory in Lukomir.</i>

44:48.520 --> 44:52.566
<i>And I see a crowd of people
in town square.</i>

44:52.649 --> 44:56.695
<i>The soldiers were dragging
Serbs from their houses.</i>

44:56.779 --> 45:00.115
<i>They raped
my mother, my sister,</i>

45:00.199 --> 45:03.369
<i>and they poured petrol
all over the wounded bodies.</i>

45:05.662 --> 45:08.832
<i>The men,
they were no! so lucky.</i>

45:08.916 --> 45:13.837
<i>They used the axes to split their heads
open and let them die in square.</i>

45:13.921 --> 45:16.840
<i>And I asked myself,
if God truly exists,</i>

45:16.924 --> 45:19.134
<i>how could he allow
such terrible things?</i>

45:19.218 --> 45:21.804
Then I think all the things
that happened in my life

45:21.887 --> 45:25.140
and I realized that is not
the proof of the absence of God,

45:25.224 --> 45:27.643
this is the proof
of his existence.

45:27.726 --> 45:32.439
Because men alone could not be
capable of such magnificent evil.

45:38.278 --> 45:41.240
Now, I spilled my guts.

45:41.323 --> 45:42.408
Your turn.

45:44.243 --> 45:45.494
Your turn!

45:47.121 --> 45:48.122
Your turn!

46:02.177 --> 46:05.931
Maybe I'm coming in
more clear now, eh?

46:27.661 --> 46:28.662
Dad?

46:30.539 --> 46:31.957
Dad, you around?

46:41.216 --> 46:42.426
Come on, Dad.

46:44.052 --> 46:44.678
Is he here?

46:46.763 --> 46:48.599
There's his car.
He might be asleep.

47:01.153 --> 47:02.279
It's okay.

47:03.864 --> 47:06.116
<i>F Chris) Dad?</i>

47:12.247 --> 47:14.166
Maybe he doesn't
want to see us.

47:14.249 --> 47:18.212
Which is exactly
why we should have called.

47:18.295 --> 47:20.881
Leave it up to my dad
not to be around.

47:41.485 --> 47:42.444
<i>Benjamin.</i>

47:47.783 --> 47:51.245
<i>Be quiet, don't move.</i>

47:51.328 --> 47:54.581
Hey, at least we have a three hour
car ride home to look forward to.

47:54.665 --> 47:58.877
At least he's asleep.
Oh. Hi, but he's awake.

47:58.961 --> 48:01.213
You want this baby
to have a father or no?

48:01.338 --> 48:03.590
<i>Let's play. Put that
fucking bow down.</i>

48:03.674 --> 48:06.134
Otherwise, I have to put
one more head on your wall.

48:06.218 --> 48:08.804
<i>That's my family, goddammit.
You threaten my family,</i>

48:08.887 --> 48:11.682
I will end you,
mother fucker, you hear me?

48:13.642 --> 48:17.104
Put that fucking bow down.
I can't hold it much longer.

48:17.187 --> 48:20.524
You wanna play? You want
your war, goddammit?

48:20.607 --> 48:23.777
Yeah. Yeah.
We can play.

48:26.572 --> 48:28.991
You want your war?

48:29.074 --> 48:30.284
Come and get it.

48:30.367 --> 48:32.786
I'll give you a head start.

48:52.848 --> 48:55.601
It is Murphy's Law, no?

48:55.684 --> 48:59.479
Whatever can go wrong
will go wrong.

49:06.236 --> 49:07.946
Bullshit cabin.

49:08.030 --> 49:09.698
Bullshit wine.

49:50.530 --> 49:53.116
It's okay.
It's okay.

49:53.200 --> 49:55.077
Hold still. Hold still.
Let me see.

50:01.833 --> 50:03.168
Let me see your tongue.

50:03.251 --> 50:04.920
Oh, there it is.

50:05.003 --> 50:07.547
Yeah, you'll still
be able to talk.

50:07.631 --> 50:11.510
That's good, 'cause I know
how much you like to talk.

50:11.593 --> 50:15.347
Yeah. I know it hurts, but it's okay.
Very superficial.

50:15.430 --> 50:17.182
Yeah, let me help you.

51:01.393 --> 51:04.187
Getting that removed.
Risky.

51:04.271 --> 51:05.772
You proud of what you did?

51:07.274 --> 51:09.651
Or maybe
you don't want to forget.

51:09.735 --> 51:12.654
It's like
with your shot.

51:12.738 --> 51:15.449
Sometimes things
become part of you,

51:15.532 --> 51:17.909
whether you want it to
or not.

51:17.993 --> 51:24.750
Scorpions, Serbian death squad, tried
for war crimes against Bosnian Muslims.

51:24.833 --> 51:27.419
Some did terrible things.

51:27.502 --> 51:31.965
Some were simply caught up in
circumstances beyond their control.

51:32.048 --> 51:33.216
Yeah, which one were you?

51:35.844 --> 51:37.804
You know, I got an idea.

51:40.223 --> 51:47.105
I think this time you should be the old
Italian guy, I should be the priest.

51:48.523 --> 51:49.775
Not talking anymore?

51:51.318 --> 51:53.445
Not giving me any
long dissertations

51:53.528 --> 51:56.531
<i>on the meaning
of war and life?</i>

51:56.615 --> 52:00.118
I'll give you
a very simple one.

52:00.202 --> 52:02.496
When life gives you lemons...

52:02.579 --> 52:03.413
that's right.

52:05.791 --> 52:07.793
Nice and simple.

52:11.213 --> 52:16.384
And my mother, she used to
always have a fresh pitcher

52:16.468 --> 52:20.222
waiting for us when Dad and
me came out of the woods.

52:20.305 --> 52:24.684
One morning we went hunting
and I got one in the chest.

52:24.768 --> 52:26.686
But I missed the heart.

52:26.770 --> 52:31.817
Probably punctured his lungs,
so we had to chase him down.

52:31.900 --> 52:33.109
Like the bowl?

52:34.986 --> 52:36.530
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

52:36.613 --> 52:38.323
More natural this way.

52:40.408 --> 52:42.118
So, anyway...

52:42.202 --> 52:44.246
we finally caught up.

52:44.329 --> 52:46.706
He made me put that
knife in his throat.

52:46.790 --> 52:49.167
Made me watch
while it bled out.

52:49.251 --> 52:52.462
Got to do it quick, he said,
otherwise the meat will spoil.

52:52.546 --> 52:55.048
You know, you wouldn't think
it, but even in an animal

52:55.131 --> 52:59.261
you can see that exact moment
when the light leaves its eyes.

53:02.305 --> 53:03.640
Almost done.

53:12.274 --> 53:14.192
Damn.

53:14.276 --> 53:16.152
No sugar.

53:18.780 --> 53:22.701
I'm just going to
have to substitute.

53:29.541 --> 53:31.042
This ought to do.

54:07.454 --> 54:08.872
<i>Well, now.</i>

54:13.960 --> 54:17.797
You think a little bit of pain
is going to make me break?

54:17.881 --> 54:19.215
I sure don't know.

54:19.299 --> 54:20.717
What if I like pain?

54:23.678 --> 54:25.931
This might be your lucky day.

54:31.937 --> 54:33.438
Here we go.

54:43.615 --> 54:45.075
Want another?

54:45.158 --> 54:45.992
Yes, please.

54:53.124 --> 55:01.883
You like that, huh? How's it feel
to be the one getting tortured?

55:01.967 --> 55:04.803
Is that what you did during the war?
Torture people?

55:04.886 --> 55:07.639
Huh? Tell me. What?

55:07.722 --> 55:09.224
What'd you do?

55:09.307 --> 55:10.433
Who'd you kill?

55:10.517 --> 55:12.102
Bosnians?
Croatians?

55:12.185 --> 55:14.479
Women? Children? Who'd you kill?

55:14.562 --> 55:16.856
<i>No children. No women. What, then?
What did you do?</i>

55:16.940 --> 55:19.275
What'd you do?
I made tools.

55:19.359 --> 55:22.320
What for? What were they used for?
Many things.

55:22.404 --> 55:27.158
For sleeping tent
and shredding muscles.

55:27.242 --> 55:33.707
The goal was to make people talk
and at the end, everyone talks.

55:33.790 --> 55:35.875
You like tools, huh?

55:35.959 --> 55:39.004
I got tools, too.

55:39.087 --> 55:41.548
Don't go anywhere.

55:54.769 --> 55:56.146
See?

55:57.856 --> 56:00.900
That's that thing
we were talking about.

56:00.984 --> 56:02.694
That word.

56:02.777 --> 56:03.319
Karma.

56:11.786 --> 56:15.540
You torture me and I'll torture you.
Sound familiar?

56:15.623 --> 56:18.626
The Serbs attacked the Bosnians because
the Bosnians attacked the Serbs.

56:18.710 --> 56:22.964
Same goes for the Croatians and
the Nazis back in World War ll.

56:23.048 --> 56:26.801
Truth is, you can go back 1,000
years and still not know

56:26.885 --> 56:29.721
how a conflict
really started.

56:29.804 --> 56:33.475
But we all know how it ends.

56:33.558 --> 56:37.395
You think you're the only one that
lost something in that war? Huh?

56:37.479 --> 56:38.980
It destroyed me.

56:40.398 --> 56:41.107
<i>You hear?</i>

56:42.650 --> 56:43.693
You hear?

57:18.311 --> 57:22.398
The war is almost over,
Colonel Ford.

57:26.361 --> 57:28.029
For gallantry in action.

57:33.910 --> 57:35.286
<i>Move!</i>

58:06.109 --> 58:08.987
Can't move, eh?

58:09.070 --> 58:11.156
I know this feeling.

58:11.239 --> 58:13.408
For three years...

58:13.491 --> 58:17.328
I had very much
the same feeling.

58:17.412 --> 58:22.417
I was shot in the back and I was
paralyzed from the neck down.

58:22.500 --> 58:24.586
And I could barely talk.

58:24.669 --> 58:27.172
And you know
how much I like to talk.

58:30.258 --> 58:35.680
And there was beautiful nurse.
Her name was Sophia.

58:35.763 --> 58:41.728
She was always
dressed in white.

58:41.811 --> 58:46.316
She always had beautiful
smile on her face.

58:46.399 --> 58:49.569
I dreamed
making love to her,

58:49.652 --> 58:51.613
fucking her.

58:51.696 --> 58:56.159
You know
what her job was?

58:56.242 --> 58:59.078
To collect
the piss and the shit

58:59.162 --> 59:03.208
from the pan
from beneath my bed.

59:03.291 --> 59:06.502
But slowly
the feeling came back.

59:06.586 --> 59:09.464
You know, I taught
myself how to write.

59:09.547 --> 59:11.466
I taught myself
how to eat.

59:11.549 --> 59:14.802
I taught myself
to speak again

59:14.886 --> 59:19.974
and to walk like a man,
not like cripple.

59:20.058 --> 59:22.810
I had no help. I had no mother.
I had no father.

59:22.894 --> 59:27.774
I had no wife or child.

59:27.857 --> 59:29.734
And you know
what kept me going?

59:33.404 --> 59:35.615
Not knowing
if you would fight,

59:35.698 --> 59:37.659
and if you did,
who would win.

59:37.742 --> 59:42.288
Because you have been like
such a worthy adversary.

01:01:48.915 --> 01:01:50.541
You win.

01:01:52.377 --> 01:01:52.794
I know.

01:01:54.545 --> 01:01:55.963
Just get it over with.

01:01:56.047 --> 01:01:58.257
Yeah, I promise.
But not yet.

01:01:58.341 --> 01:01:59.967
Well, what are you
waiting for?

01:02:01.844 --> 01:02:05.681
I'm waiting for your
confession, Colonel Ford.

01:02:22.281 --> 01:02:25.326
Please, please stop.

01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:28.329
Sit there. Sit there.

01:02:36.129 --> 01:02:41.884
You have no idea
how lucky you are.

01:02:41.968 --> 01:02:48.266
My country has beauty,
but there is an invisible layer

01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:52.645
of blood caked over everything.

01:02:52.728 --> 01:02:58.734
Most people cannot see it,
but I have special eyes.

01:02:58.818 --> 01:03:01.821
Everywhere I look,
I see red.

01:03:09.954 --> 01:03:10.705
Move!

01:03:12.915 --> 01:03:20.256
A young cowboy, Billy Joe,
grew restless on the farm.

01:03:20.339 --> 01:03:27.138
The boy filled with wanderlust,
he really meant no harm.

01:03:27.221 --> 01:03:32.810
Billy Joe fell to the floor,
the crowd all gathered round

01:03:32.894 --> 01:03:37.231
and wondered
at his final words,

01:03:37.315 --> 01:03:42.111
"Don't take
your guns to town, son.

01:03:42.195 --> 01:03:45.364
"Don't leave
your guns at home.

01:03:45.448 --> 01:03:49.702
"We'll take your gun to town. "

01:03:51.996 --> 01:03:53.331
Ah.

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:59.003
Is little Benny tired?

01:03:59.086 --> 01:04:00.087
Benjamin?

01:04:04.884 --> 01:04:06.677
Benjamin.

01:07:34.552 --> 01:07:38.180
The shooting pain again, eh?

01:07:38.264 --> 01:07:42.727
Is it the shrapnel
trying to move its way out?

01:07:42.810 --> 01:07:46.355
There it is. What if I
try to help it along?

01:07:53.904 --> 01:07:55.656
Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:58.325
Bless me,
but do not forgive me.

01:07:58.409 --> 01:08:01.454
It has been one week
since my last confession.

01:08:01.537 --> 01:08:04.915
It has been a big week and I could go
down the list, but there's short of time.

01:08:04.999 --> 01:08:07.376
And of course
you have better things to do.

01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:09.044
So, don't forgive us.
Okay.

01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:14.425
I confess my sins onto you,
but do not dare absolve them.

01:08:14.508 --> 01:08:20.264
I want to be part of them
for me to never forget them.

01:08:20.346 --> 01:08:24.643
Okay, you. Your turn.
You, you confess.

01:08:24.727 --> 01:08:25.435
Now!

01:08:27.604 --> 01:08:29.814
It is only
the three of us here.

01:08:29.899 --> 01:08:34.028
You and me and him.

01:08:34.111 --> 01:08:37.448
I will keep your secret,
Colonel Ford.

01:08:37.531 --> 01:08:40.451
In the end
he's not even listening.

01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:46.415
You are the only one
getting in the way of the truth.

01:08:51.462 --> 01:08:52.962
I give UP-

01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:54.465
You win.

01:08:59.428 --> 01:09:00.638
<i>You win.</i>

01:09:02.515 --> 01:09:03.974
But you lose.

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:16.403
Maybe you'll finally tell him the
truth when you see him face to face.

01:09:19.031 --> 01:09:21.617
You want to kill me?

01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:22.743
Look me in the eye.

01:10:13.127 --> 01:10:14.545
<i>October.</i>

01:10:18.090 --> 01:10:19.884
Like this, right?

01:10:21.635 --> 01:10:22.511
.95-

01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:28.434
<i>My unit' was first' on
the ground outside-</i>

01:10:28.517 --> 01:10:32.813
We were tasked with liberating the Bosnian
Muslims from the internment camp there.

01:10:32.897 --> 01:10:35.649
The first thing
we noticed was the smell.

01:10:35.733 --> 01:10:37.902
Got our attention
right away.

01:10:37.985 --> 01:10:41.906
<i>Like my father's
taxidermy shed.</i>

01:10:41.989 --> 01:10:47.536
And when we got to the camp, we saw
boxcars sitting out on the tracks.

01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:50.956
Looked like they were
full of old clothes.

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:57.504
We got closer, we began to
make out hands and legs.

01:10:57.588 --> 01:10:59.465
<i>It was the faces.</i>

01:10:59.548 --> 01:11:04.011
<i>Faces just skin
stretched over skulls.</i>

01:11:04.094 --> 01:11:05.846
Bodies stuck together.

01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:07.723
Stuck to the ground
from the frost,

01:11:07.806 --> 01:11:10.768
eyelids frozen open
staring right at you.

01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:17.024
Camp was run
by Serbians,

01:11:17.107 --> 01:11:19.944
called themselves
the Scorpions.

01:11:20.027 --> 01:11:23.989
<i>Dozens of these Scorpions,
they surrendered.</i>

01:11:24.073 --> 01:11:26.825
They were all going to go back
to a POW camp for a few weeks

01:11:26.909 --> 01:11:30.454
and then after the war,
they'd all just go home.

01:11:30.537 --> 01:11:34.625
I'd seen- we'd all seen
firsthand what they'd done,

01:11:34.708 --> 01:11:37.461
the children
they butchered,

01:11:37.544 --> 01:11:39.838
women they raped,
tortured.

01:11:42.424 --> 01:11:46.095
<i>$0 we stripped them down, burned their
uniforms, marched them up a hill</i>

01:11:46.178 --> 01:11:50.641
<i>in the middle of nowhere- And we got to
the top, my men lined the prisoners up</i>

01:11:50.724 --> 01:11:54.853
<i>on their knees facing away.</i>

01:11:54.937 --> 01:11:57.356
I joined up
to make my father proud,

01:11:57.439 --> 01:12:03.112
but when I told him, he
tried to talk me out of it.

01:12:03.195 --> 01:12:05.114
"Remember the elk,"
he said.

01:12:05.197 --> 01:12:08.742
"Remember the look in
their eyes at the end.

01:12:08.826 --> 01:12:11.495
"You see that happen to another man,
doesn't matter if he's a friend

01:12:11.578 --> 01:12:15.916
"or an enemy. you see that
happen, it changes you forever. "

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.085
<i>Of course
I didn't believe him.</i>

01:12:18.168 --> 01:12:19.712
<i>Had to find out
for myself.</i>

01:12:21.839 --> 01:12:23.132
Should have listened.

01:12:40.482 --> 01:12:42.276
<i>I</i>

01:12:42.359 --> 01:12:45.404
I been in a lot of wars,
but never one like Bosnia.

01:12:47.906 --> 01:12:50.451
<i>That war got into my head.</i>

01:12:50.534 --> 01:12:52.953
<i>I saw it like a poison.</i>

01:13:04.923 --> 01:13:06.717
<i>I just wanted it to stop.</i>

01:13:09.261 --> 01:13:13.140
<i>I though! maybe killing a few of the
worst' ones would make it go away.</i>

01:13:13.223 --> 01:13:14.641
<i>So I pulled the trigger.</i>

01:13:18.729 --> 01:13:23.400
Just like that I became everything
I hated about that damn war.

01:13:23.484 --> 01:13:25.527
Everything.

01:13:25.611 --> 01:13:28.822
Then when I got home I couldn't
even look myself in the mirror

01:13:28.906 --> 01:13:30.657
or my son in the eye.

01:13:37.039 --> 01:13:39.666
Yeah, I figured he was
just better off without me.

01:13:42.419 --> 01:13:46.840
Then I was not prepared
to die, but now...

01:13:46.924 --> 01:13:50.594
you should
pull the trigger.

01:13:50.677 --> 01:13:54.223
<i>Put an end to this for us.</i>

01:13:54.306 --> 01:13:56.100
You can finish it.

01:13:59.770 --> 01:14:02.856
Don't you know
the things I have done?

01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:07.277
Don't I deserve to die?

01:14:07.361 --> 01:14:10.030
We are both killers.

01:14:10.114 --> 01:14:11.031
<i>Are we not?</i>

01:14:13.367 --> 01:14:15.536
We're the same,
you and I.

01:14:20.707 --> 01:14:24.795
He is nothing
but meat and flesh

01:14:24.878 --> 01:14:28.549
and tendon, put him
out of his misery.

01:14:31.468 --> 01:14:33.762
Please, God,
pull the trigger.

01:14:48.527 --> 01:14:49.403
Pull the trigger!

01:15:41.872 --> 01:15:48.212
So, this old Italian guy, he wants
to confess to the local priest.

01:15:48.295 --> 01:15:51.340
He's getting on in age and wants
to make it right with God.

01:15:51.423 --> 01:15:55.135
So, he tells the priest,
"Father, back in the war

01:15:55.219 --> 01:15:57.304
"there was this beautiful
woman that came to my house

01:15:57.387 --> 01:16:01.141
"and asked me to protect
her from the Nazis,

01:16:01.225 --> 01:16:03.477
<i>"so I hid her up
in my attic. "</i>

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:06.271
The priest says, "Well, that's a
wonderful thing you did, my son.

01:16:06.355 --> 01:16:09.316
<i>"There's no reason
to confess. "</i>

01:16:09.399 --> 01:16:12.319
The old man says, "But
it gets worse, Father.

01:16:12.402 --> 01:16:14.988
"She started to repay
me with sexual favors,

01:16:15.072 --> 01:16:18.617
"you know, like, blowjobs
and shit like that. "

01:16:24.539 --> 01:16:28.001
The priest says,
"Well...

01:16:28.085 --> 01:16:30.003
"you both are in great
danger, my son.

01:16:30.087 --> 01:16:32.089
"War makes sinners
of us all.

01:16:32.172 --> 01:16:34.633
"So, you are forgiven. "

01:16:34.716 --> 01:16:37.594
The old man says, "Well,
thank you, Father.

01:16:37.678 --> 01:16:40.430
"It's a great burden
off my mind.

01:16:40.514 --> 01:16:42.891
"But I have
one more question. "

01:16:42.975 --> 01:16:46.019
"What's that, my son?"

01:16:46.103 --> 01:16:49.064
"Should I have told her
that the war was over?"

01:16:58.115 --> 01:16:59.157
I don't get it.

01:17:01.243 --> 01:17:03.120
It's not that funny.

01:17:11.545 --> 01:17:15.048
I believe I got something
that belongs to you.

01:17:18.218 --> 01:17:19.469
Yeah.

01:17:23.890 --> 01:17:25.767
He's got your eyes.

01:17:29.771 --> 01:17:32.316
Maybe I'll see them
for myself.

01:19:04.908 --> 01:19:05.909
Zivjeli.

01:19:14.167 --> 01:19:16.795
<i>The war is
only just beginning.</i>

01:19:16.878 --> 01:19:20.632
<i>Thousands are homeless and fleeing
the province as the war escalates.</i>

01:19:20.715 --> 01:19:23.427
<i>Troops have made progress
in the province today,</i>

01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:26.638
<i>continuing a cavalcade
of intense aerial shelling</i>

01:19:26.721 --> 01:19:28.515
<i>with no signs
of anyone stopping.</i>

01:19:28.598 --> 01:19:31.309
<i>"It's like hell on earth,"
said one woman</i>

01:19:31.393 --> 01:19:33.687
<i>when she fled with her three
children for the border.</i>

01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:35.647
<i>It never ends.</i>

01:19:35.730 --> 01:19:38.108
<i>But for many of these now...</i>

01:20:16.938 --> 01:20:18.148
Hey.

01:20:19.733 --> 01:20:21.610
Sorry I'm late.

01:20:33.955 --> 01:20:35.373
Come on.

01:20:35.457 --> 01:20:37.459
There's someone
I want you to meet.
