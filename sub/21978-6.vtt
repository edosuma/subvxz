01:09.686 --> 01:12.045
Shredder, since you are unable

01:12.338 --> 01:15.240
to eliminate the turtles by yourself,

01:16.183 --> 01:19.519
I'm giving you the eggs you
asked for.

01:20.078 --> 01:22.089
Oh, I've always wanted to study

01:22.479 --> 01:24.574
Dimension X wildlife at close range.

01:24.835 --> 01:27.429
These babies may look like meatballs,

01:27.758 --> 01:29.501
But once they hatch...

01:33.873 --> 01:35.182
No, you idiots.

01:38.313 --> 01:42.213
Good reflexes. We may
make a ninja of you yet.

01:42.779 --> 01:44.287
I almost forgot.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.690
Here's the instructions.

01:47.783 --> 01:50.005
But, master, how are we
going to make sure

01:50.422 --> 01:51.764
that the turtles get these eggs ?

01:52.370 --> 01:53.602
We won't have to.

01:53.959 --> 01:55.665
The turtles will come to us.

01:56.050 --> 01:57.909
Big pizza bake-off today.

01:58.284 --> 02:00.995
Free samples and neato prizes.

02:01.684 --> 02:05.476
Excuse me, young man,
but i'll take those.

02:11.353 --> 02:13.027
Brochures ? But why ?

02:13.340 --> 02:14.647
Watch.

02:20.387 --> 02:23.085
Once our turtle friends
hear about free pizza,

02:23.383 --> 02:26.267
They'll fall right into our trap.

02:27.393 --> 02:28.717
Ok, Donatello,

02:29.095 --> 02:32.056
I'm ready to get down
with this machine of yours.

02:32.590 --> 02:34.978
You might be sorry you said that.

02:35.461 --> 02:38.890
I hope you studied your
opponent well, Michelangelo.

02:39.934 --> 02:41.934
No sweat, Splinter.

02:42.261 --> 02:45.441
The day i can't kick butt
on some washing machine

02:45.907 --> 02:48.393
is the day I hang up my...

02:48.659 --> 02:50.985
Num-chucks !

02:54.586 --> 02:56.430
Excellent strategy, Raphael.

02:56.863 --> 02:59.776
Sometimes sabotaging
an enemy's line of supply

03:00.041 --> 03:02.275
is more effective than a frontal attack.

03:02.646 --> 03:03.769
Thank you, sensei.

03:04.081 --> 03:05.205
I've always been great

03:05.442 --> 03:06.598
against household appliances.

03:06.908 --> 03:07.921
Surf's up !

03:08.139 --> 03:09.981
Cowabunga !

03:12.541 --> 03:20.478
What are these things ?

03:21.319 --> 03:26.960
Tube-uloso, dudes.

03:27.360 --> 03:28.683
Check this out.

03:29.060 --> 03:31.023
Big pizza bake-off.

03:31.352 --> 03:34.689
Free samples and deluxe pizza prizes.

03:35.628 --> 03:36.770
Permit me.

03:37.731 --> 03:40.180
My intuition confirms my suspicion.

03:40.587 --> 03:42.963
This pattern of slash marks

03:43.196 --> 03:44.569
could only have been made

03:44.569 --> 03:47.456
by the prongs on Shredder's
gauntlets.

03:47.702 --> 03:49.949
Then the bake-off could be a trap !

03:50.183 --> 03:51.306
Precisely.

03:51.584 --> 03:53.084
Fabuloso.

03:53.364 --> 03:55.533
A couple rounds with tinface

03:55.833 --> 03:59.650
oughta work up an appetite
for those free pizzas.

03:59.917 --> 04:01.412
Take care, Michelangelo.

04:01.747 --> 04:04.258
Shredder is a far more
dangerous opponent

04:04.470 --> 04:06.237
than a mere washing machine.

04:10.054 --> 04:12.305
Would the turtles love this !

04:12.713 --> 04:15.702
April, why don't you forget
about those turtles

04:15.973 --> 04:18.422
and start thinking about real
live men ?

04:18.651 --> 04:21.742
You mean, like your last date
with that accordion player ?

04:22.209 --> 04:23.457
Forget him !

04:23.787 --> 04:26.482
His mustache weighed
more than his brain.

04:31.056 --> 04:32.255
April !

04:32.583 --> 04:33.660
It's us.

04:34.064 --> 04:35.225
Are you crazy ?

04:35.475 --> 04:37.393
You shouldn't be seen
in public like this !

04:39.789 --> 04:41.816
<i>Irma, dolce mia,</i>

04:42.086 --> 04:44.162
It is I, Alfredo.

04:45.077 --> 04:46.294
Oh, no !

04:46.608 --> 04:47.529
It's him !

04:47.982 --> 04:49.260
<i>It's-- ciao.</i>

04:50.056 --> 04:52.555
Alfredo ? The mustache !

04:52.943 --> 04:55.327
<i>Irma, mi amore.
Wait.</i>

04:55.843 --> 04:57.684
That Irma. We could make

04:57.917 --> 04:59.669
such beautiful music together.

05:00.026 --> 05:01.114
This sounds serious.

05:01.477 --> 05:03.773
I think it's time you met the family.

05:04.053 --> 05:05.891
Oh, I would be most honored.

05:06.220 --> 05:08.056
Then shake hands
with papa Leonardo,

05:08.321 --> 05:09.965
uncle Donatello, cousin Raphael,

05:10.258 --> 05:12.131
and auntie Michelangelo.

05:12.630 --> 05:14.866
Our bambino will be green ?

05:15.283 --> 05:16.825
<i>Arrivederci.</i>

05:17.138 --> 05:18.418
Thanks for the good deed, guys.

05:18.953 --> 05:20.103
How can i repay you ?

05:20.398 --> 05:23.661
Well, you could get us about
50 pounds of those free samples.

05:24.032 --> 05:27.479
And enter our names for
those primo prize pizzas.

05:27.905 --> 05:29.244
Sure thing, guys.

05:29.619 --> 05:30.727
Any sign of Shredder ?

05:30.957 --> 05:32.804
I just know he's here somewhere.

05:33.282 --> 05:34.688
I can practically smell him.

05:34.937 --> 05:36.513
I smell something better.

05:36.841 --> 05:38.320
Pizzas !

05:38.975 --> 05:39.900
Master Shredder,

05:39.900 --> 05:41.476
The pizza prizes have arrived.

05:42.053 --> 05:43.384
Hurry, you fool.

05:43.658 --> 05:45.548
It's time to add the secret ingredient.

05:49.213 --> 05:51.472
Truly a work of art.

05:54.765 --> 05:57.216
And now the moment
we've all been waiting for...

05:57.447 --> 05:59.974
The drawing for 3 deluxe pizzas.

06:09.052 --> 06:11.145
And here's a volunteer to help us...

06:11.519 --> 06:13.155
Mr. Baxter Stockman.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.077
Baxter Stockman ?

06:15.419 --> 06:16.649
And where there's Baxter,

06:16.869 --> 06:17.981
There's bound to be...

06:18.436 --> 06:19.586
Shredder !

06:20.663 --> 06:22.470
Let's get the tinfaced geek !

06:22.725 --> 06:24.106
Cowabunga !

06:24.590 --> 06:25.885
All right, got it.

06:26.284 --> 06:27.710
2 deluxe pizzas to go.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.332
Ah, you heard it, Mario.

06:29.614 --> 06:31.518
2 deluxe to this address here.

06:31.955 --> 06:34.264
But, boss, we don't have
any deluxe left.

06:34.482 --> 06:36.404
Well, take them from
the table outside then.

06:36.621 --> 06:38.010
I'll make some more for the drawing.

06:40.819 --> 06:42.720
Gangway, folks. Emergency !

06:43.498 --> 06:45.105
Excuse us.
Coming through.

06:45.526 --> 06:47.181
There he goes into the kitchen.

06:47.495 --> 06:48.819
Pump up the volume, guys.

06:48.819 --> 06:50.410
We got him cornered.

06:51.252 --> 06:54.402
Oh, wow !
Pizza heaven !

06:55.001 --> 06:56.143
Never mind that.

06:56.143 --> 06:57.933
We got some ninja-ing to do.

06:59.511 --> 07:01.190
Give it up, Shredder.
You're history.

07:01.817 --> 07:03.545
We'll see about that, mutants.

07:10.205 --> 07:11.892
Whoa, how about that ?

07:12.192 --> 07:14.184
Saved by the shell !

07:14.964 --> 07:17.880
Hey, Shredder,
shred your way out of this.

07:20.664 --> 07:23.075
Gladly.
Have a dough-net.

07:27.615 --> 07:29.804
Quick, Donatello,
Some tomato sauce.

07:30.051 --> 07:32.544
One order of tomato
sauce coming up.

07:37.710 --> 07:38.740
All right, chump.

07:38.991 --> 07:41.326
And now for the finishing touch.

07:45.399 --> 07:47.380
No, no ! Not that !

07:50.568 --> 07:53.325
I hate anchovies.

07:54.524 --> 07:55.976
Oh ! Oh, those turtles !

07:56.195 --> 07:58.023
They'll pay dearly for this.

08:01.063 --> 08:03.107
And now the drawing will begin.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.168
Professor, will you do the honors ?

08:05.465 --> 08:06.338
Gladly.

08:06.708 --> 08:08.289
And the winners are Leonardo,

08:08.991 --> 08:11.031
Donatello, and Michelangelo.

08:14.532 --> 08:15.666
April O'Neill,

08:15.932 --> 08:18.085
in appreciation for your services

08:18.336 --> 08:20.034
to pizza lovers everywhere,

08:20.305 --> 08:22.637
we'd like to present you with this...

08:22.902 --> 08:24.321
One slice...

08:25.210 --> 08:26.977
Michelangelo.

08:27.569 --> 08:29.829
Er, I mean, one pizza.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.279
Why, thank you, boys.

08:31.568 --> 08:33.356
Irma and I can eat this at her place.

08:34.148 --> 08:35.808
What's the address ?

08:37.668 --> 08:39.984
There. It should be
warmed up in a minute.

08:44.312 --> 08:45.601
What on earth was that ?

08:45.880 --> 08:47.209
Probably just a short circuit.

08:47.504 --> 08:48.931
You know how these
old buildings are.

08:54.414 --> 08:57.007
Guess this is as close
as i'm ever gonna get

08:57.237 --> 08:59.303
to having a romantic dinner
for two.

08:59.530 --> 09:00.923
Now, Irma, i'm sure one day

09:01.124 --> 09:02.465
you'll hear wedding bells.

09:03.654 --> 09:04.558
Well, until then

09:05.151 --> 09:07.771
I'll just have to settle
for a microwave bell.

09:10.203 --> 09:13.466
Wow ! Is this pizza heavy !

09:15.523 --> 09:16.728
What is this ?

09:28.737 --> 09:30.840
And when we opened the pizza box,

09:31.060 --> 09:32.978
this horrible little creature jumped out.

09:35.210 --> 09:36.838
We'll be right there, April.

09:37.174 --> 09:37.984
Quick, guys.

09:38.253 --> 09:40.761
April's under attack by some
weird creature.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.152
What are we waiting for ?

09:42.435 --> 09:44.038
Let's peel rubber !

09:46.050 --> 09:48.811
Ok. Where's this killer pizza ?

09:49.080 --> 09:50.498
It's not the pizza.

09:50.782 --> 09:52.791
It's the creature that
came with the pizza.

09:53.071 --> 09:55.519
Hey, sounds like a great
title for a horror movie.

09:57.725 --> 09:59.143
I'll get him.

10:02.448 --> 10:03.990
No. I got him.

10:09.138 --> 10:11.139
April, what is going on ?

10:11.451 --> 10:13.400
It just sort of hatched
in the microwave

10:13.677 --> 10:15.128
and then it ate the pizza.

10:16.771 --> 10:19.436
Sounds like my kind of creature.

10:25.200 --> 10:26.699
Playtime's over, hot stuff.

10:27.789 --> 10:30.707
How come we didn't get any
monsters with our pizzas ?

10:31.082 --> 10:33.515
Maybe because yours
were replacements.

10:33.829 --> 10:36.276
Ours was the only
original prize pizza.

10:37.642 --> 10:40.555
Dudes, you smell something ?

10:40.901 --> 10:42.971
Oh, no !
The rug's burning !

10:43.249 --> 10:44.190
Where'd he go ?

10:44.421 --> 10:46.308
Looks like he got clean away.

10:49.772 --> 10:51.769
April, what happened
to the original pizzas

10:51.970 --> 10:53.298
that ours replaced ?

10:53.609 --> 10:55.262
A delivery boy from UFO Pizza

10:55.262 --> 10:56.951
took them to fill an order.

10:57.216 --> 11:00.113
Which means there could be
2 more of these little monsters ?

11:00.331 --> 11:02.624
We've gotta stop that kid
from delivering them !

11:02.943 --> 11:04.450
If it isn't history by now.

11:07.461 --> 11:09.476
I heard voices.
Was that...

11:09.476 --> 11:10.831
No time to explain, Irma.

11:11.069 --> 11:12.976
You'll see it all on
the happy hour news !

11:16.795 --> 11:19.209
Bingo. I found our delivery boy.

11:19.785 --> 11:22.220
And he's hauling the killer pizzas.

11:22.561 --> 11:24.529
Then let's cut him off at the pass.

11:28.040 --> 11:29.210
Follow that blimp, Vernon.

11:29.430 --> 11:30.785
Don't let it out of your sight.

11:31.033 --> 11:33.097
Must you be
A back-seat driver ?

11:35.808 --> 11:37.150
It stopped
At the penthouse.

11:38.414 --> 11:39.581
2 deluxe.

11:39.926 --> 11:42.249
Yippie ! Our pizzas !

11:42.812 --> 11:44.169
They're probably cold.

11:44.408 --> 11:46.279
Let's heat them
In the microwave.

11:47.085 --> 11:48.305
There's
An open window.

11:48.305 --> 11:50.299
Turtle assault team,
Are you ready ?

11:50.755 --> 11:52.985
Turtle power !

11:54.670 --> 11:57.851
Wait, kids. Don't
Open those boxes !

12:01.640 --> 12:03.549
Why should we
Listen to you ?

12:03.844 --> 12:05.805
You're nothing but
A bunch of turtles.

12:06.404 --> 12:08.660
And that's even lower
Than baby-sitters.

12:09.628 --> 12:12.422
Yeah. If you Want
pizzas, Go get your own.

12:14.779 --> 12:18.020
I just hope this isn't Another
one of your Wild turtle chases.

12:18.293 --> 12:19.333
Trust me, vernon.

12:19.580 --> 12:21.301
This will be the story
Of the year.

12:23.480 --> 12:24.525
Go, guys !

12:24.775 --> 12:26.242
Let's get them !

12:29.256 --> 12:31.336

12:48.026 --> 12:49.274
<i>Uh, the rear.</i>

Oh, vernon !

12:56.171 --> 12:56.961
Hurry, vernon.

12:57.169 --> 12:58.697
The creatures
Are getting away.

12:58.950 --> 13:01.007
Oh, dear.
What a pity.

13:02.112 --> 13:03.484
If you should see
These creatures,

13:03.751 --> 13:04.933
Call the police.

13:10.318 --> 13:14.138
This is april o'neill For

13:19.800 --> 13:21.753

13:39.369 --> 13:41.393
Slippery little devil,
Aren't you ?

13:44.204 --> 13:46.196
Oh, great.

13:46.478 --> 13:48.536
Now i'm in
The sewer system.

13:54.856 --> 13:56.526
The creatures'
Footprints stop here.

13:56.805 --> 13:57.982
Looks like they jumped
In the river.

13:58.255 --> 14:00.301
I hope it wasn't
To take a bath.

14:07.492 --> 14:10.044
The pawprints lead
Right into the clothes dryer.

14:10.421 --> 14:12.857
You wanna go first,
Or should i ?

14:13.091 --> 14:16.285
Me ? Do i look like i wear
Wash-and-wear suits ?

14:17.428 --> 14:19.194
Oh, hurry up,
Vernon !

14:19.405 --> 14:20.536
We don't
Want to lose it !

14:20.765 --> 14:21.907
Speak for yourself.

14:22.154 --> 14:23.726
Yoo-hoo ! April !

14:24.022 --> 14:24.944
Irma !

14:25.426 --> 14:26.676
Thank goodness
You're here.

14:27.275 --> 14:28.799
I was getting so frightened.

14:29.233 --> 14:31.280
Don't worry. Now that
We're all together,

14:31.496 --> 14:33.479
There's nothing to be
Frightened of.

14:45.862 --> 14:48.423
And then it burned right
Through my wall

14:48.658 --> 14:49.560
And ran off.

14:49.843 --> 14:52.245
There's something really
Strange going on here.

14:52.637 --> 14:54.415
Oh, ridiculous--
Worrying about

14:54.647 --> 14:56.895
Some harmless,
Furry little creature.

14:59.626 --> 15:01.603
Yo, dudes,
No creatures,

15:02.476 --> 15:05.583
But we have turned up
A couple of weasels.

15:06.720 --> 15:07.984
According
To the instructions,

15:08.375 --> 15:09.640
Turning this knob

15:09.967 --> 15:12.057
Should summon
The creatures.

15:12.290 --> 15:13.849
And by activating
This switch,

15:14.084 --> 15:16.393
We can send them
Against the turtles.

15:18.173 --> 15:21.820
Try it, bozo ! We can handle
anything You can throw at us.

15:22.103 --> 15:23.587
Or do you think
We're scared

15:23.836 --> 15:25.955
Of those Pizza-eating
Powder puffs ?

15:27.144 --> 15:28.483
Uh, raphael.

15:28.703 --> 15:31.108
We're shaking In our
shells, Aren't we, guys ?

15:31.357 --> 15:33.552
Now that you
Mention it...

15:39.172 --> 15:41.761
What are those ?

15:42.278 --> 15:45.523
Our cute little
Pizza-eating powder puffs.

15:45.896 --> 15:47.530
Baxter, contact krang.

15:47.891 --> 15:49.797
I'm certain
He'll enjoy this.

15:50.075 --> 15:51.403
Yes, master.

15:53.852 --> 15:56.157
Looks like this one
Could use a manicure.

15:57.656 --> 15:58.840
Splendid.

15:59.185 --> 16:02.165
The creatures have reached
Their full growth. How delightful.

16:04.775 --> 16:07.039
Will ya look
At that thing !

16:07.365 --> 16:10.110
Looks just like one
Of your old girlfriends,

16:10.576 --> 16:12.013
Only prettier.

16:18.268 --> 16:20.269
Oh, thanks, raphael.
I owe you one.

16:20.517 --> 16:22.293
You owe me 6,
But who's counting ?

16:22.604 --> 16:23.885
Watch this !

16:25.572 --> 16:26.551
Now you see it,

16:26.911 --> 16:28.272
Now you don't.

16:31.654 --> 16:33.607
Radical concept, dude.

16:38.537 --> 16:42.387
April, i j-j-just found
What we're looking for.

16:42.682 --> 16:44.008
Why do you
Sound so upset ?

16:44.288 --> 16:47.049
B-b-because
It also found us.

16:51.481 --> 16:54.467
That irma ! You just
Can't take her anywhere.

16:58.041 --> 16:59.239
That's it, my pets.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.171
Do your worst.

17:02.588 --> 17:03.913
Ah ! Forget it,
Baxter.

17:04.209 --> 17:06.083
You just
Lost control.

17:08.390 --> 17:10.404
Megamove,
Donatello.

17:10.969 --> 17:14.710
You fools ! Now the creatures
Are out of control !

17:20.468 --> 17:22.901
Hey, you guys,
Don't go.

17:23.351 --> 17:25.394
We wanna watch.

17:25.976 --> 17:27.365
Baxter, you idiot.

17:27.594 --> 17:28.810
Look at those
Instructions.

17:29.110 --> 17:30.636
There must be
Something we can do.

17:30.933 --> 17:32.076
Yes, master.

17:34.833 --> 17:36.789
Ergo, if we zap
The creatures

17:37.064 --> 17:39.703
With an even larger
Burst of energy...

17:41.245 --> 17:43.761
...they'll turn back
Into eggs again.

17:44.103 --> 17:47.095
Burn rubber, guys !
Maybe we can outrun them !

17:48.189 --> 17:50.266
Holy guacamole !

17:50.636 --> 17:52.432
What is that ?

17:52.664 --> 17:55.474
Whatever it is, We'll
go down Fighting !

17:56.255 --> 17:57.643
April !

17:58.081 --> 18:00.076
Boy, am i glad
To see you fellas !

18:00.544 --> 18:01.695
Are you alone ?

18:01.932 --> 18:03.912
I am now, thanks
To irma's fainting

18:03.912 --> 18:05.441
And vernon's
Chickening out.

18:05.441 --> 18:07.019
Like, what is this--

18:07.219 --> 18:09.267
A b.y.o.m. Party ?

18:09.886 --> 18:11.385
B.y.o.m. ?

18:11.668 --> 18:13.974
Bring your own monster.

18:16.766 --> 18:18.797
Uh-oh, guys.
We're surrounded.

18:19.028 --> 18:20.774
And mr. Home-run
Slugger here

18:20.774 --> 18:23.146
Had to go bat The
controller Into the water.

18:23.398 --> 18:25.757
Well, it seemed like
A good idea at the time.

18:26.037 --> 18:27.737
No problemo, dudes.

18:27.969 --> 18:29.331
I'll scoop it out.

18:29.671 --> 18:31.805
Cowabunga !

18:32.961 --> 18:33.771
Now what ?

18:33.973 --> 18:36.376
We better go back And
help shredder And baxter.

18:36.624 --> 18:38.282
Are you out
Of your gourd ?

18:38.282 --> 18:39.922
They're the bad guys,
Remember ?

18:40.203 --> 18:41.480
As splinter says,

18:41.696 --> 18:44.055
Sometimes one must make
A pact with evil

18:44.347 --> 18:46.439
In order
To accomplish good.

18:46.694 --> 18:48.862
You know, i don't
Remember him saying that.

18:49.198 --> 18:50.696
Well, he would have,

18:50.696 --> 18:52.229
If he'd ever thought
About it.

18:52.631 --> 18:54.722
Back ! Back, you swine !
Back, i say !

18:55.803 --> 18:58.184
Mind if we
Join you ?

18:58.496 --> 19:00.309
What are you mutants
Doing here ?

19:00.654 --> 19:02.913
I never thought i'd
Say this, shredder,

19:03.145 --> 19:05.173
But we're on
The same side.

19:14.019 --> 19:15.427
Try again, sucker !

19:23.722 --> 19:26.453
You fool ! I had him
right Where i wanted him.

19:26.686 --> 19:27.795
Sure, you did.

19:31.087 --> 19:32.537
Guys ! Help !

19:32.771 --> 19:34.083
Hold on, raphael.

19:34.083 --> 19:35.627
We'll save you.

19:38.372 --> 19:40.681
Guys, this could be
The last sewer

19:40.975 --> 19:42.510
We'll ever get
To enjoy.

19:42.900 --> 19:45.205
At least we'll go down
Fighting with honor--

19:45.406 --> 19:46.907
Like real turtles.

19:47.168 --> 19:49.275
Personally,
I'd rather go on living--

19:49.275 --> 19:50.931
As a mock turtle.

19:52.897 --> 19:53.738
I found it !

19:53.738 --> 19:56.113
Is that fabuloso,
Or what ?

19:57.483 --> 19:59.354
Yoo-hoo, humongoids.

19:59.682 --> 20:01.603
Now out, you guys.

20:03.073 --> 20:04.579
Way to go, michelangelo !

20:04.827 --> 20:06.406
Give 'em another blast.

20:08.214 --> 20:11.504
I can't ! The batteries
Must've gotten wet !

20:15.812 --> 20:18.373
Look, guys !
We still got a chance.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.740
Those are electrical
Power lines.

20:21.972 --> 20:22.775
So what ?

20:23.144 --> 20:25.546
So that gives me
An idea. Watch.

20:37.541 --> 20:38.667
How'd you
Do that ?

20:39.495 --> 20:41.833
Simple. I remembered
Baxter saying

20:42.066 --> 20:43.490
That a large charge
Of energy

20:43.735 --> 20:45.546
Could reverse
The growing process.

20:45.856 --> 20:47.244
Boy, it's a good
Thing you did.

20:47.452 --> 20:50.302
Those creatures Nearly
stopped Our growing process.

20:50.618 --> 20:53.032
Speaking of baxter,
Where is that geek ?

20:53.240 --> 20:54.186
There he goes,

20:54.483 --> 20:55.746
And shredder's with him.

20:56.077 --> 20:58.492
You mutants may have
Won this round,

20:58.900 --> 21:01.131
But there
Will be others.

21:01.476 --> 21:04.426
That's right. There
will Be others.

21:04.426 --> 21:06.386
Will you shut up ?

21:08.257 --> 21:09.600
I hope this experience

21:09.600 --> 21:11.941
Has taught all of you
A valuable lesson.

21:12.174 --> 21:13.359
Well, it sure has,
Splinter.

21:13.617 --> 21:16.499
Like, there's no such
Thing as a free lunch.

21:16.499 --> 21:18.203
Or, in this case,
A free pizza.

21:18.666 --> 21:20.386
Hey, speaking of pizza,

21:20.614 --> 21:21.861
I just whipped together

21:22.157 --> 21:23.755
a Michelangelo Special.

21:24.311 --> 21:26.590
Oh, no ! Not more meatballs !

21:26.963 --> 21:28.570
Not to worry, April.

21:28.898 --> 21:31.380
These aren't the kind
that turn into creatures.

21:31.754 --> 21:33.693
I got those right here.

21:37.575 --> 21:38.962
Or was it here ?

21:39.302 --> 21:41.767
Oh, no !
Oh, no !
