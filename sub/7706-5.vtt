WEBVTT

00:02.370 --> 00:04.336
And, uh,
with this remote control

00:04.338 --> 00:06.171
you punch in your code numbers.

00:09.977 --> 00:11.777
Then the people log goes on

00:11.779 --> 00:14.113
and it records
who's watching what.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.447
You see, from this data

00:15.449 --> 00:17.616
you know,
we determine our ratings.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.018
[glass breaking]

00:21.355 --> 00:23.522
Cat.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.524
[crashing]

00:27.628 --> 00:28.727
Big cat.

00:29.964 --> 00:31.697
[loud crash]

00:33.534 --> 00:35.467
Dead cat.

00:35.469 --> 00:38.170
Uh, yeah, well, um
if you have any questions

00:38.172 --> 00:39.805
uh, just call the office

00:39.807 --> 00:41.240
and, uh, ask for Louie.

00:41.242 --> 00:43.375
Oh, I-I thought
your name was Ron.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.077
It is.

00:50.885 --> 00:52.051
Is he gone?

00:52.053 --> 00:53.852
Yes, he..

00:53.854 --> 00:55.821
What were you doing in there?

00:55.823 --> 00:57.856
Looking for tomato paste.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.725
I broke a tomato.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.528
Hey, what's that?

01:02.530 --> 01:05.164
A hook-up
for the shopping network?

01:05.166 --> 01:06.565
It's a, it's a people log.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.600
We've been asked
to become a Thompson family.

01:10.337 --> 01:12.671
You're changing
your name to Thompson?

01:12.673 --> 01:15.240
I just learned
how to spell "Tanner."

01:16.210 --> 01:17.943
We're not changing our name.

01:17.945 --> 01:21.113
ALF, this is
a Thompson people log.

01:21.115 --> 01:24.183
It measures what we watch on TV.

01:24.185 --> 01:27.352
Great! Now I'll finally
find out who's taller.

01:27.354 --> 01:29.755
Me or Michael J. Fox.

01:31.692 --> 01:34.259
[theme music]

01:55.282 --> 01:58.117
[music continues]

02:33.988 --> 02:36.221
[instrumental music]

02:38.659 --> 02:41.693
Explain how television ratings
work, will you, Willie?

02:41.695 --> 02:46.632
Well, uh, ratings are designed
primarily for advertisers

02:46.634 --> 02:49.434
you know, in order to assist
them in their own in-the-house

02:49.436 --> 02:51.770
research, they require certain
demogra--

02:51.772 --> 02:53.705
Never mind!

02:53.707 --> 02:56.975
Okay, now,
every time we watch TV

02:56.977 --> 02:58.610
we have to log in.

02:58.612 --> 03:01.046
Now, does everybody
know their code numbers?

03:01.048 --> 03:02.948
- Three.
- Two.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.883
- Four.
- One.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.451
Wrong.

03:06.453 --> 03:07.986
Twelve.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.621
Wrong again.

03:09.623 --> 03:12.291
Kate, if you make me
guess every number there is

03:12.293 --> 03:14.359
we could be here for hours.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.661
ALF, that's not the point.

03:15.663 --> 03:17.629
I think what Kate
is trying to say--

03:17.631 --> 03:20.132
I know what Kate
is trying to say!

03:20.134 --> 03:22.267
I'm an alien, not a foreigner.

03:23.204 --> 03:26.071
Okay. I can't have a number.

03:26.073 --> 03:27.973
Give me a letter.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.242
N-O.

03:30.244 --> 03:32.578
That's two letters.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.479
Just try to understand, ALF.

03:34.481 --> 03:38.817
The operative word
in "People log" is "People."

03:38.819 --> 03:40.652
One of which, you are..

03:40.654 --> 03:43.655
...not...one.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.090
That's cruel.

03:45.092 --> 03:47.059
Not to mention
poorly constructed

03:47.061 --> 03:48.961
from a grammatical standpoint.

03:50.397 --> 03:52.331
ALF, we just don't think
that the ratings people

03:52.333 --> 03:55.000
are interested in..

03:55.002 --> 03:56.902
...viewers from outer space.

03:58.105 --> 03:59.738
In other words,
the operative word

03:59.740 --> 04:03.442
in "Thompson family"
is "Family."

04:03.444 --> 04:06.111
One of which, I am not..

04:06.113 --> 04:09.348
...part of...this one.

04:09.350 --> 04:12.517
- You're one of the family, ALF.
- Oh, sure.

04:12.519 --> 04:15.520
Like Arnold Schwarzenegger
is one of the Kennedys.

04:17.258 --> 04:19.358
Why can't ALF have a number?

04:19.360 --> 04:21.193
He watches TV all the time.

04:21.195 --> 04:22.394
And the man
did say that everyone

04:22.396 --> 04:24.263
who watches should log in.

04:24.265 --> 04:26.798
See? They're on my side.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.368
You know, Willie,
maybe ALF should have a number.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.869
I mean, we do
have a responsibility

04:30.871 --> 04:34.439
to give them all the data
as accurately as possible.

04:34.441 --> 04:38.710
Yeah, and I love pushing
these little silver buttons.

04:38.712 --> 04:41.913
Alright, ALF,
you're number five.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.448
Just don't break that thing.

04:43.450 --> 04:46.618
Kate, Katie, Kate o' nine tails

04:46.620 --> 04:48.787
have I ever broken anything?

04:50.958 --> 04:52.457
Well, lately?

04:53.927 --> 04:55.560
This week?

04:56.797 --> 04:58.330
Today?

05:00.067 --> 05:02.067
Since lunch?

05:02.069 --> 05:04.303
[instrumental music]

05:09.910 --> 05:12.744
(woman on TV)
'Coming up next,
"The MacNeil-Lehrer report."'

05:12.746 --> 05:16.481
'But first, weather maps
of developing nations..'

05:16.483 --> 05:18.984
Why aren't we watching
"The Love Connection?"

05:18.986 --> 05:21.420
We're waiting
for the "MacNeil-Lehrer Report."

05:21.422 --> 05:23.522
Well, la-dee-dah.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.424
(woman on TV)
'...598.'

05:25.426 --> 05:27.592
I thought the popcorn popper
was broken.

05:27.594 --> 05:30.862
It is. I popped this
with your curling iron.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.934
I won't ask how you
melted the butter.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.703
Hot comb.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.274
You know, I thought
the whole point

05:42.276 --> 05:44.109
of this ratings hoo-hah

05:44.111 --> 05:47.612
was to find out
what people really watch.

05:47.614 --> 05:50.482
Well, we really
watch MacNeil and Lehrer.

05:50.484 --> 05:54.052
Oh, yeah? Describe them to me.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.121
Well..

05:56.123 --> 05:58.890
...they wear neckties.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.459
And..

06:00.461 --> 06:03.128
...and they speak
in well-modulated voices.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.296
[knock on door]

06:04.298 --> 06:05.864
(Trevor)
'Yo, Tanners!'

06:05.866 --> 06:07.299
'It's me, Trevor!'

06:07.301 --> 06:11.069
Speaking of
"well-modulated voices."

06:11.071 --> 06:13.972
Um, just-just a minute, Trevor.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.374
ALF, go into the kitchen.

06:15.376 --> 06:18.176
"Go into the kitchen.
Go into the kitchen."

06:18.178 --> 06:20.479
As a woman,
you should be sensitive

06:20.481 --> 06:23.248
to the demeaning undertones
in that remark.

06:23.250 --> 06:25.317
Now!

06:25.319 --> 06:27.486
You're betraying your sisters.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.492
Hey, Willie. How's it goin'?

06:33.494 --> 06:34.726
- Hello.
- Hi, Kate.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.862
- Hi, Trevor.
- I was..

06:36.864 --> 06:38.497
Hey.

06:38.499 --> 06:39.765
Is this one
of those box-things

06:39.767 --> 06:41.500
that lets you steal cable?

06:41.502 --> 06:43.101
No, of course it's not.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.503
No, we've been asked
to become one of those

06:44.505 --> 06:46.171
TV ratings families.

06:46.173 --> 06:48.073
- No kiddin'.
- Yeah.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.508
Well, that figures.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.076
You got your two adults

06:51.078 --> 06:53.678
you-you got your two kids,
you got your cat.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.281
'You got your average height.'

06:56.283 --> 06:58.750
You're the prototypical
American family.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.520
Too bad this rating stuff's
a crock.

07:01.522 --> 07:02.921
Well, why do you say that?

07:02.923 --> 07:06.124
Because the best programs
always come in last.

07:06.126 --> 07:08.260
Now, case in point..

07:08.262 --> 07:09.728
"Here's Lucy Again."

07:09.730 --> 07:12.764
You know the one where she moves
back in with her mother?

07:12.766 --> 07:16.067
Who could play Lucy's mother?

07:16.069 --> 07:18.537
I think they used
a fried wig on a stick.

07:20.374 --> 07:23.975
And then there's that other
program that's on right now..

07:23.977 --> 07:25.544
"Polka Jamboree."

07:25.546 --> 07:27.913
It's like a Slavic "Soul Train."

07:27.915 --> 07:30.248
Here. Dig.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.883
[instrumental music on TV]

07:31.885 --> 07:34.453
[Trevor humming]

07:40.727 --> 07:43.962
No. No, no, Trevor.
Uh, uh, we'll tune in later.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.497
Right now,
we wanted to check out

07:45.499 --> 07:48.633
the, uh, rainfall in Sri Lanka.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.068
Going on a picnic?

07:51.338 --> 07:53.071
Trevor..

07:53.073 --> 07:55.440
...uh, w-was there
something you wanted?

07:55.442 --> 07:57.075
Oh, yeah. Heh.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.244
Could you turn on our sprinklers
while we're gone?

07:59.246 --> 08:01.346
Raquel and I are taking a trip
to the big apple.

08:01.348 --> 08:03.081
Oh, New York.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.749
No, Washington state.

08:04.751 --> 08:08.086
Some farmer up there grew
an 80-pound golden delicious.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.357
Well, sure, we'll be happy
to water the yard, Trevor.

08:12.359 --> 08:14.092
Where's the control?

08:14.094 --> 08:15.160
I don't have one.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.662
I just hook up
my hose to your spigot.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.998
Well, I should
have no problem, then.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.466
I never do.

08:21.468 --> 08:22.934
See you in a month.

08:26.607 --> 08:30.008
"Polka Jamboree!"
Turn on "Polka Jamboree!"

08:30.010 --> 08:33.678
Oh, why would you wanna watch
"Polka Jamboree?"

08:33.680 --> 08:36.648
They're playing
"Cat Barrel Polka."

08:36.650 --> 08:40.318
That's "Beer Barrel Polka,"
I believe.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.954
They put beer in barrels?

08:42.956 --> 08:45.056
Well, they take
the cats out first.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.860
Makes sense.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.866
[instrumental music on TV]

08:56.637 --> 08:59.037
We're here in the office
of NBC entertainment president

08:59.039 --> 09:02.140
Brandon Tartikoff, talking
about the new rating system.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.475
Oh, boy.

09:03.477 --> 09:06.878
Brandon, what effect will
the new people log system

09:06.880 --> 09:09.414
have on rating trends
as we know them?

09:09.416 --> 09:11.983
Well, research
indicates, that, uh

09:11.985 --> 09:15.687
younger viewers will be up,
older viewers will be down.

09:15.689 --> 09:18.323
Females will be down,
males will be up.

09:18.325 --> 09:20.158
Daytime down, late night up.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.760
Large audience shows

09:21.762 --> 09:23.495
while they'll still
have a large audience

09:23.497 --> 09:25.730
may find
their audiences smaller.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.567
Smaller audience shows
will have a larger audience.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.268
Relatively speaking, of course.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.203
But the most consistent
aspect will be

09:32.205 --> 09:35.206
the total lack
of ratings consistency.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.742
Which is, strangely enough
consistent with

09:37.744 --> 09:41.580
what we've found to be
an overall...inconsistency.

09:41.582 --> 09:44.449
If there's a quiz later,
I'm sunk.

09:44.451 --> 09:46.751
I see one of the other networks
is throwing a couple of

09:46.753 --> 09:48.887
new shows
at your Thursday night line up.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.855
Uh, I believe
it's "Polka Jamboree"

09:50.857 --> 09:52.691
and "Here's Lucy Again."

09:52.693 --> 09:55.527
"Lucy" is always formidable

09:55.529 --> 09:57.128
but we expect to do well.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.530
As for "Polka Jamboree"

09:58.532 --> 09:59.864
well, that was
offered to me first

09:59.866 --> 10:02.200
and frankly, I passed.

10:02.202 --> 10:05.937
Time's up already? Wow. Okay.
Brandon, thank you very much.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.206
We'd like to thank
our guests, Brandon Tartikoff

10:08.208 --> 10:11.977
and Spuds Mackenzie.
We'll see you next week.

10:11.979 --> 10:15.246
(man on TV)
'Oh-ho-ho! We're admitting it!'
We're insane!'

10:15.248 --> 10:17.949
'And we eat spiders, but
you have to be insane to eat'

10:17.951 --> 10:20.585
'spiders, right?
Oh, we're not dangerous!'

10:20.587 --> 10:24.823
Then why do they have you
in that straitjacket? Ha! Ha!

10:24.825 --> 10:29.561
(man on TV)
'So don't be<i> afraid</i> to visit our
used-car emporium! Ask for..'

10:29.563 --> 10:32.063
Hey! I wanted to watch
Crazy Steve

10:32.065 --> 10:34.733
tear a drumstick off
that tarantula.

10:36.603 --> 10:39.137
It's 3 o'clock
in the morning, ALF.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.973
Well, what's time
to a spider, Willie?

10:43.477 --> 10:45.410
Why is the TV in here?

10:45.412 --> 10:48.446
'Cause I couldn't move
the refrigerator out there.

10:48.448 --> 10:49.981
Don't touch that dial.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.752
I love when you're assertive.

10:55.022 --> 10:57.856
Go. Sleep. Now.

10:57.858 --> 11:01.326
Well, can I just
ask one bedtime question?

11:02.195 --> 11:03.862
Yeah, what?

11:03.864 --> 11:07.098
I saw that
"Polka Jamboree" tonight.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.134
It's really funny.

11:09.136 --> 11:12.270
Why does it get
such crummy ratings?

11:12.272 --> 11:14.639
For one thing..

11:14.641 --> 11:16.675
...it's not
supposed to be funny.

11:18.779 --> 11:21.346
What's the other thing?

11:21.348 --> 11:23.014
Nobody watches it.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.016
Next question.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.351
I thought there was gonna be

11:26.353 --> 11:28.286
one question here.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.455
This is the bonus round.

11:30.457 --> 11:33.725
What happens to a show
when it's ratings are bad?

Goodnight, ALF.

Well, wait, wait!

If-if more people
watched "Polka Jamboree"

11:50.644 --> 11:52.644
the ratings would go up, right?

11:52.646 --> 11:54.679
Yes, but that..

11:54.681 --> 11:56.881
...would take a miracle.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.685
A miracle, huh?

It's so corny.

Oh, Kate?

Kitchen is closed, and
please, turn that program off.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.386
Oh, let him watch it, Kate.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.655
That show is so bad

13:10.657 --> 13:13.758
it'll be off the air soon,
anyway.

13:15.595 --> 13:17.061
Well, what does that mean?

your previous statement

13:19.432 --> 13:20.832
reflected the sum total

13:20.834 --> 13:22.934
of your knowledge
on this subject.

A dream of ours here
at "Polka Jamboree"

13:45.692 --> 13:47.258

In nine cases
out of ten, it's you.

14:21.828 --> 14:23.962
Well, maybe
this is that tenth case.

14:23.964 --> 14:27.498
- Is it?
- No.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.367
What have you done?

14:30.637 --> 14:33.404
Well, remember
that night last week

14:33.406 --> 14:36.140
when you told me
to rig the ratings?

14:36.142 --> 14:38.743
I never told you
to rig the ratings.

14:38.745 --> 14:41.145
You didn't tell me not to.

14:41.147 --> 14:44.015
You rigged the ratings?

14:44.017 --> 14:47.151
Well, actually,
I hastened the inevitable.

14:47.153 --> 14:50.555
"Polka Jamboree"
was ready to explode.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.824
And you lit the fuse.

14:52.826 --> 14:56.194
I called a few people
and encouraged them to watch.

14:56.196 --> 14:57.428
A few?

14:58.899 --> 15:00.465
Could you ask him?

15:02.002 --> 15:04.002
How many people did you call?

15:04.004 --> 15:07.438
A thousand.
Give or take a thousand.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.174
And you say I use
the phone too much.

15:10.176 --> 15:13.611
Hey, don't worry.
I did it during off-peak hours.

15:13.613 --> 15:15.513
2:00 to 6:00 a.m.

15:15.515 --> 15:19.751
And nothing outside
the 48 contiguous states.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.519
How considerate.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.788
Hey, my way of saying

15:23.790 --> 15:25.623
"I know we're on a budget."

15:26.559 --> 15:28.693
A thousand phone calls.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.895
Give or take a thousand.

15:30.897 --> 15:32.563
But you know, even 2000 people

15:32.565 --> 15:35.133
wouldn't increase
the ratings that much.

15:35.135 --> 15:36.367
Aha!

15:36.369 --> 15:38.903
Unless they were
each given a number

15:38.905 --> 15:41.739
and logged into
the Thompson rating system.

15:41.741 --> 15:46.377
But how-how did you get
the figures into their system?

15:46.379 --> 15:47.946
Aha!

15:47.948 --> 15:49.714
I hooked the ratings box

15:49.716 --> 15:52.550
to the transmission
on my spaceship.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.619
Then I shifted into sideways.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.923
I'm ready to talk
about those phone calls, now.

15:58.925 --> 16:01.793
Aha! We're past
that point, Willie.

16:01.795 --> 16:04.996
Aha! No, we're not!

16:06.900 --> 16:09.100
Aha.

16:09.102 --> 16:12.236
ALF, what you did was illegal.

16:12.238 --> 16:15.406
Oh, like I've been to law school
and would know that.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.343
What you did was wrong, ALF.

16:18.345 --> 16:19.944
Do you understand "Wrong?"

16:19.946 --> 16:22.447
Wr.. The opposite of right.
Wrong.

16:22.449 --> 16:24.048
Wrong!

I don't, I don't,
I don't have an explanation.

16:48.708 --> 16:51.342
Yes, sir, I realize,
I understand, I turned down

16:51.344 --> 16:53.144
uh, "Polka Jamboree"
in the first place

16:53.146 --> 16:55.646

that I..

Hi, Bill.
How are you?

17:10.997 --> 17:14.232
Great episode last week
when Theo lost his comb.

17:14.234 --> 17:16.601
I never, ever
thought he'd find it.

17:18.505 --> 17:20.405
The ratings.

17:20.407 --> 17:25.476
Yeah. Talk about a shock, huh?

17:25.478 --> 17:28.379
Well, we knew we couldn't
be number one forever, right?

17:28.381 --> 17:30.448
By the way, can you
play the accordion?

17:31.985 --> 17:34.519
Sorry, just a thought.

17:34.521 --> 17:37.422
You bet I'm gonna get
to the bottom of this.

the Jell-O.

- Send out a memo, Barbara.

17:46.499 --> 17:49.233
I wanna develop
three new shows.

17:51.004 --> 17:53.504
"The Days and Nights
of Molly Polka"

17:53.506 --> 17:55.740
and something
with McLean Stevenson.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.141
Right away.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.681
What are you guys doing?

18:03.683 --> 18:05.049
We'll work quietly.

18:05.051 --> 18:06.851
Does this wastebasket go?

18:06.853 --> 18:08.352
Does it have a peacock on it?

18:08.354 --> 18:10.188
- Yeah.
- Leave it.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.724
How about the, uh,
name plate on the door?

18:13.726 --> 18:14.792
Take it.

18:15.962 --> 18:17.462
Hey, wait a minute.

18:17.464 --> 18:20.932
This is the guy who turned down
"Polka Jamboree."

18:20.934 --> 18:23.234
That's why we're moving him out.

18:23.236 --> 18:24.735
How about the lamp over here?

18:24.737 --> 18:27.605
Mm-hmm. His new office
is too small.

18:29.709 --> 18:32.076
Excuse me, sir,
you have calls waiting from, uh

18:32.078 --> 18:34.045
"60 Minutes,"
"The National Enquirer"

18:34.047 --> 18:36.280
and some guy named ALF.

18:36.282 --> 18:39.050
I'll call them back
when I get a new extension.

18:39.052 --> 18:40.785
If I get a new extension.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.554
Uh, this ALF guy says

18:43.556 --> 18:46.124
he's the one responsible
for the ratings.

18:47.393 --> 18:49.560
- What line?
- Two.

18:49.562 --> 18:53.731
Oh, and it was very nice
working for you, sir.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.801
- I'm not out of here yet.
- Yeah, right.

Um...talk fast.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.316

19:12.318 --> 19:16.020
I hope people don't lose their
jobs over this

19:16.022 --> 19:18.689
Polka-get thing.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.691
Yeah. Me too.

19:23.029 --> 19:24.495
Well, they shouldn't.

19:24.497 --> 19:28.366
- This whole thing is my fault.
- What?

19:28.368 --> 19:31.536
See, I didn't want
"Polka Jamboree" cancelled

19:31.538 --> 19:35.540
so I called a thousand people,
give or take a thousand

19:35.542 --> 19:38.776
and then I hooked up
my transmission to the TV box

19:38.778 --> 19:42.213
and shifted into sideways.

19:42.215 --> 19:45.283
This is the "Letterman Show,"
isn't it?

19:45.285 --> 19:47.018
No, it's ALF.

Listen, as long
as I've got you on the phone..

19:49.622 --> 19:51.956
...can I pitch a wacky idea?

19:51.958 --> 19:53.691
Why not?

19:57.463 --> 19:59.997
Okay, now open mind.

19:59.999 --> 20:02.400

20:02.402 --> 20:05.002

'Yeah.'

into their garage, see?

- Spaceship?
- 'Yeah, yeah!'

[instrumental music]

20:34.901 --> 20:37.268

change your mind

20:37.270 --> 20:40.171
about being a Thompson family?

20:40.173 --> 20:42.740
- Our cat.
- Big dead one.

with the buttons.

at the office when you called?

20:53.019 --> 20:55.353

Fine.

Uh, just out of curiosity, uh..

20:57.857 --> 21:02.360
Who, uh, chose you
as the typical American family?

21:02.362 --> 21:05.263
- Computer error.
- Had to be.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.538
Where does he get off saying

21:14.540 --> 21:16.674
we're not a typical
American family?

21:17.777 --> 21:21.545
Have you looked
in a mirror, lately?

21:21.547 --> 21:25.216
Hey, think of me
as the son you never had.

21:25.218 --> 21:27.418
We have a son.

21:27.420 --> 21:31.389
Well, think of me as the son
you never wanted.

21:31.391 --> 21:33.391
Well, son..

Now!

21:44.237 --> 21:48.239
Well, I started a perfectly
legal letter-writing campaign

21:48.241 --> 21:50.174
to save the show.

21:50.176 --> 21:53.944
Uh, incidentally, next time
you're at the post office
