WEBVTT

00:02.602 --> 00:03.603
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO REAL ONES
IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL.

00:06.473 --> 00:08.074
Help me put these things away.

00:08.608 --> 00:09.976
-Tell me what's going on.
-I can't.

00:10.710 --> 00:11.911
Not now! Please!

00:17.717 --> 00:20.720
Take the keys, Mateo.
Wait for me in the car.

00:20.787 --> 00:22.222
-What happened?
-Nothing.

00:22.288 --> 00:23.356
Take everything to the car.
I'll be with you in a minute.

00:24.057 --> 00:25.191
Thank you.

00:30.730 --> 00:32.699
Help me put this away.

00:33.199 --> 00:34.734
Stop it, Lucio!

00:38.905 --> 00:42.442
-Forgive me.
-Why?

00:43.943 --> 00:44.911
For everything.
Forgive me.

00:45.812 --> 00:47.647
You're making me scared.
What's the matter?

00:48.848 --> 00:51.584
Trust me.
Everything will be fine.

00:51.651 --> 00:54.888
Trust me, please.
Come on, help me.

00:55.889 --> 00:56.923
Hurry up.

01:56.316 --> 02:00.220
THE FRAGILITY OF BODIES

02:14.067 --> 02:15.368
Five minutes.

02:17.237 --> 02:18.404
Thanks.

02:22.709 --> 02:23.843
What're you doing here?

02:31.718 --> 02:32.819
How are you?

02:34.254 --> 02:36.489
What do you think?
I feel miserable.

02:37.724 --> 02:39.292
I have a headache.
I feel like smoking.

02:39.726 --> 02:40.860
And I am very thirsty.

02:41.261 --> 02:43.263
Why didn't you ask
for a glass of water?

02:43.730 --> 02:45.698
I don't want any water.
I just want to go away, dad.

02:46.799 --> 02:47.967
Where is Federico?

02:48.368 --> 02:51.471
He's talking to the chief.
What happened?

02:52.572 --> 02:53.806
It was an accident.

02:56.042 --> 02:58.011
I was driving down the road...

02:58.077 --> 02:59.579
and I suddenly saw a guy
who wanted to shoot...

02:59.646 --> 03:01.080
a friend of mine.
What else could I do?

03:01.915 --> 03:03.249
That was not an accident.

03:06.753 --> 03:08.121
-How is he?
-Who?

03:08.888 --> 03:09.756
Rafael, my friend.

03:11.057 --> 03:13.293
He is in hospital.
His leg bone is broken.

03:14.093 --> 03:15.828
-Is he out of danger?
-Yes, he is.

03:15.895 --> 03:17.564
The guy you ran over
is not so well though.

03:22.235 --> 03:25.939
-Is he dead?
-No, in the ICU.

03:26.306 --> 03:28.408
-You were lucky.
-Why?

03:28.875 --> 03:31.978
If he dies, you can be accused
of involuntary manslaughter.

03:32.512 --> 03:34.547
And if they find out
it was intentional,

03:34.614 --> 03:36.182
it'll be murder
in the first degree.

03:36.583 --> 03:39.519
Depending on the judge,
you can get up to 30 years.

03:41.354 --> 03:44.190
Don't worry, dad.
I won't be charged.

03:44.591 --> 03:46.593
-How can you be so sure?
-I'm sure.

03:48.528 --> 03:52.732
To get one of my daughters
out of jail...

03:52.799 --> 03:54.601
has always been
one of my worst nightmares.

03:55.001 --> 03:56.135
You're overreacting, dad.

03:56.202 --> 03:58.738
You've got me out of trouble
a hundred times.

03:59.105 --> 04:01.441
Those were stupid things.
This is something serious.

04:03.710 --> 04:05.311
When the police chief sees
their criminal records,

04:05.378 --> 04:06.346
he'll give me a medal.

04:07.747 --> 04:10.516
I didn't call you.
I don't know why you're here.

04:10.850 --> 04:13.820
Federico called me.
That's what makes me sad.

04:14.387 --> 04:17.223
You're a grown-up man.
You'll get over it.

04:17.590 --> 04:18.891
The other lawyer
wants to see you.

04:20.860 --> 04:21.928
Tell him to come in.

04:22.295 --> 04:23.730
I'm afraid you'll have
to leave, sir.

04:24.063 --> 04:25.865
All right.

04:27.166 --> 04:29.002
If they ask you about the guy
who is in hospital,

04:29.068 --> 04:30.336
don't say
he is a friend of yours.

04:42.949 --> 04:46.919
Try to calm her down.
That'd be convenient for her.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.225
Are you okay?

04:56.562 --> 04:57.497
You'll be fine.

04:57.830 --> 04:58.865
Do you know
something about Lucio?

04:58.931 --> 05:00.400
-No. What happened?
-Are you sure?

05:00.466 --> 05:01.367
No, I don't know
anything about him.

05:01.701 --> 05:03.469
-He killed the guy.
-What?

05:03.536 --> 05:05.438
Lucio shot him.

05:05.505 --> 05:06.839
He was with Rafa
and Rafa told me.

05:07.273 --> 05:08.775
-Those guys again.
-Who?

05:08.841 --> 05:11.577
Those who attacked us.
In the car.

05:11.944 --> 05:13.346
Lucio shot the guy
and ran away?

05:13.713 --> 05:15.982
No, I saw him there
and told him to run away.

05:16.716 --> 05:19.319
Those guys are real bastards.
I know it was self-defense.

05:19.686 --> 05:21.154
But I can't defend Lucio
being in jail.

05:21.220 --> 05:23.556
If they catch him,
they'll kill him.

05:23.956 --> 05:25.024
Calm down.
You are here.

05:25.391 --> 05:27.226
I have my father to help me.
But what about Lucio?

05:28.861 --> 05:32.565
It was a mistake.
Did someone see you?

05:32.932 --> 05:34.334
I don't know.
Were there any witnesses?

05:34.734 --> 05:36.402
Not yet.
But they may show up.

05:36.769 --> 05:37.970
Let's not panic.

05:38.037 --> 05:39.005
We'll decide what to do
if someone shows up.

05:39.972 --> 05:41.774
How long will the report take?

05:42.475 --> 05:44.877
-What report?
-The one about the bullet.

05:45.311 --> 05:46.312
It came from Lucio's gun.

05:46.679 --> 05:48.514
We live in Argentina.
That'll take forever.

05:48.915 --> 05:51.117
If those bastards want it,
they'll get it in no time.

05:51.484 --> 05:52.518
Calm down, Vero.

05:52.919 --> 05:54.854
The only ones who know this
are you and me, Lucio,

05:54.921 --> 05:55.988
Rafael and the two crooks.

05:56.055 --> 05:58.024
-Nobody else?
-You know what I mean.

05:58.391 --> 05:59.859
One is dead
and the other is in the ICU.

06:00.293 --> 06:03.329
-I wouldn't be so worried.
-I would, Fede.

06:03.996 --> 06:05.031
Who is the D.A.?

06:05.098 --> 06:06.733
I don't know?
I'll find it out.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.469
Is Rafael's leg condition
really serious?

06:09.535 --> 06:11.471
He has a broken bone
but he didn't get killed.

06:12.138 --> 06:13.439
Did he make a statement?

06:13.506 --> 06:14.941
No, I want to speak with him
before the police do.

06:15.341 --> 06:18.378
Tell him to say it was a theft.
He didn't know the thief.

06:20.646 --> 06:22.615
-What is it?
-Nothing.

06:23.816 --> 06:27.220
Yes, things are getting
very nasty.

06:31.457 --> 06:34.494
Yes, he is very rough
on the soccer field.

06:35.762 --> 06:38.097
I kicked him hard anyway.

06:39.766 --> 06:41.134
Will you compete against him?

06:42.068 --> 06:44.837
I think so.
I hope he gets hit by the train.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.210
-Does the train go quickly?
-Sort of.

06:52.345 --> 06:53.579
Can I escape at the last minute?

06:54.013 --> 06:55.415
Maybe, but don't take chances.

07:01.154 --> 07:02.255
What happened?

07:04.857 --> 07:06.893
-What's wrong?
-It's my father.

07:08.528 --> 07:12.298
-He got shot.
-Where?

07:12.799 --> 07:14.901
On the leg.
Didn't you see it on TV?

07:15.568 --> 07:20.940
It was a theft.
And the reporter was arrested.

07:21.841 --> 07:23.042
-Who?
-My father's friend.

07:23.109 --> 07:27.513
The girl who came to his house
the other day.

07:28.247 --> 07:31.918
If she is in jail,
how can we contact her?

07:32.585 --> 07:34.454
What are we going to do
if Rivero calls you?

07:35.154 --> 07:36.622
I don't know.

07:38.357 --> 07:40.460
-Call her, Dientes.
-Don't be dumb.

07:40.526 --> 07:44.130
They must've taken
her mobile phone away in jail.

07:44.797 --> 07:46.265
Al least try it.

07:49.235 --> 07:52.872
I'll send her a message
asking her to call me.

07:54.607 --> 07:58.244
Thanks.
Have some water, Vero.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.446
I have a splitting headache.
When can I leave?

08:00.813 --> 08:02.048
Your father is talking
to the judge.

08:02.448 --> 08:03.783
Here is your mobile phone.

08:03.850 --> 08:05.051
There are a couple of calls
from an unknown number.

08:06.018 --> 08:07.987
Maybe Lucio called me.

08:16.095 --> 08:18.498
Hello. I've missed a call
from this number.

08:20.233 --> 08:22.001
We have to figure things out.

08:24.270 --> 08:25.538
Who is speaking?

08:27.206 --> 08:28.741
You know who is speaking.

08:28.808 --> 08:30.443
I'd like to have
a one-on-one meeting with you.

08:31.711 --> 08:32.912
Where?

08:33.713 --> 08:36.015
Yes, I know where that is.
When?

08:38.117 --> 08:39.151
I can't.
I'm in jail.

08:39.218 --> 08:43.689
I know.
Work it out.

08:46.826 --> 08:48.227
-Who was it?
-Juan García.

08:49.562 --> 08:51.697
-I have to leave, Fede.
-What did he say to you?

08:52.031 --> 08:54.700
Get me out of here.
He wants to see me.

08:55.234 --> 08:57.570
Are you crazy?
You won't go to see that guy.

08:57.937 --> 08:58.838
He wants to negotiate.

08:59.238 --> 09:00.473
If he wanted me dead,
I'd be dead already.

09:00.907 --> 09:03.342
How can you be so sure
about this guy's thoughts?

09:03.709 --> 09:05.978
Tell my father to get me
out of here right now.

09:16.155 --> 09:18.257
Hello, I'm Dientes.
Call me, please.

09:40.813 --> 09:41.747
Good bye.

09:51.090 --> 09:54.126
Let's go away.
The four of us.

09:54.193 --> 09:55.928
As far away as possible.
They won't find us.

09:56.696 --> 10:00.800
I can't. Don't worry.
Everything will be all right.

10:16.983 --> 10:19.185
-I love you.
-I don't.

10:43.542 --> 10:44.510
What shall I do?

10:44.910 --> 10:46.579
Nothing. Call me
as soon as Rivero calls you.

10:46.946 --> 10:47.947
What shall I tell him?

10:48.314 --> 10:49.649
Tell him you'll do as he says.

10:49.715 --> 10:52.618
But don't go to the competition
under any circumstances.

10:53.219 --> 10:56.689
It's very dangerous.
You can't go there.

10:57.023 --> 10:59.325
When he calls you, you call me.
Is that clear?

11:15.408 --> 11:16.609
What is the plan, Vero?

11:17.243 --> 11:18.244
There is no plan.

11:18.644 --> 11:20.546
I'll meet with Juan García
and see what happens.

11:20.913 --> 11:22.081
I don't understand.

11:22.548 --> 11:23.916
I have no way out.
I must meet him.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.719
-Where?
-At a restaurant in Palermo.

11:26.786 --> 11:27.953
My car is here.

11:30.056 --> 11:31.424
He asked me to go alone.

11:31.824 --> 11:33.392
I won't let you go alone.

11:33.759 --> 11:36.195
I must do what he says.
I can't take any chances.

11:36.595 --> 11:39.365
I just want him to admit
he is responsible...

11:39.432 --> 11:41.067
for the death of all those kids.

11:41.434 --> 11:42.635
Why don't you record
the conversation?

11:43.035 --> 11:45.237
I thought about that.
He can't be so dumb.

11:45.871 --> 11:48.107
Do me a favor.
Check up on Rafa.

11:48.441 --> 11:49.475
He's just lost a friend.

11:49.842 --> 11:52.978
Do me a favor. Watch out!
Don't go too far.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.020
Why am I doing all this?

12:31.183 --> 12:34.754
I'm sorry.
We're closed.

12:35.087 --> 12:37.389
-I'm Verónica Rosenthal.
-I'll take care.

12:42.394 --> 12:43.662
Your handbag, please.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.546
Tell me what I should do.
I'm not a psychic.

13:00.613 --> 13:01.714
Raise your arms.

13:18.564 --> 13:19.632
I'm done.

13:54.466 --> 13:55.768
Why did you want to see me?

13:57.703 --> 13:59.839
I wanted to give you the chance
to do things right.

14:00.773 --> 14:02.241
I don't usually do this.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.811
But we have interests in common.

14:08.380 --> 14:11.050
I don't get it.
What interests?

14:12.184 --> 14:17.056
Your father, Aaron Rosenthal.
We're old acquaintances.

14:20.326 --> 14:21.727
He didn't tell you about it.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.397
Your father's law firm
handled several cases for me.

14:25.898 --> 14:30.569
He is a wonderful lawyer.
I do respect him.

14:32.204 --> 14:35.007
My father and I
are different persons.

14:35.407 --> 14:36.742
Yes, of course.

14:37.209 --> 14:40.713
But things get a little mixed up
in this case.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.649
-What did he tell you?
-Nothing.

14:44.016 --> 14:45.251
I didn't talk to him.

14:45.651 --> 14:47.186
And as far as I can see,
you neither.

14:48.420 --> 14:50.122
-I don't believe you.
-Never mind.

14:50.456 --> 14:53.058
I didn't ask you to come here
to talk about your father.

14:53.425 --> 14:55.327
I don't like what happened
to my men today.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.029
I'm coming
to the end of my patience.

14:57.463 --> 15:00.132
Skilled labor
is difficult to find.

15:00.466 --> 15:02.568
This is what we'll do next.

15:02.968 --> 15:05.504
Really?
What will we do next?

15:06.772 --> 15:10.309
This must end here.
Right now.

15:13.746 --> 15:14.947
Excuse me, sir.

15:16.849 --> 15:19.985
-What will you have, miss?
-She's leaving.

15:25.291 --> 15:28.527
I can give you Rivero.
And maybe Palma too.

15:29.228 --> 15:30.729
So you want to negotiate
with me.

15:31.230 --> 15:34.967
Yes, of course.
It's all about negotiation.

15:35.701 --> 15:38.704
What will you give in exchange?

15:38.771 --> 15:40.072
What do you want?

15:40.139 --> 15:41.941
I want you
to stop bothering me.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.977
What will happen
with Lucio and Rafael?

15:46.245 --> 15:49.181
Who? I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:49.548 --> 15:53.619
Rafael worked for Rivero.
Your men tried to kill him.

15:55.354 --> 15:57.222
Yes, I remember.

15:59.258 --> 16:02.494
And Valrossa
is the train driver, right?

16:04.563 --> 16:08.734
They will be
out of the negotiation.

16:09.101 --> 16:10.602
I don't care about them.

16:11.036 --> 16:12.304
Rivero and Palma
are not enough for me.

16:13.806 --> 16:17.176
I want Amante and the gamblers.
I want them all.

16:19.912 --> 16:21.280
What is so funny?

16:22.114 --> 16:26.785
You are very funny.

16:28.487 --> 16:31.390
The negotiation
should benefit me, not you.

16:32.424 --> 16:34.259
It is an exit for you.

16:35.194 --> 16:36.695
And the only one you'll get.

16:38.397 --> 16:41.033
Rivero and Palma.
That's it.

16:48.674 --> 16:52.077
You know what?

16:53.579 --> 16:58.851
Go home and take a hot bath,
with some nice bath salts.

16:59.551 --> 17:03.689
Think about it
and give me an answer.

17:04.890 --> 17:06.358
Make it quick.

17:10.963 --> 17:13.499
And change that look
on your face.

17:14.733 --> 17:16.301
You can't always win.

17:17.603 --> 17:20.873
Sometimes it's a tie.
This is a tie.

17:22.141 --> 17:25.210
Think carefully and your father
will become a granddad one day.

17:27.646 --> 17:29.214
That's all that matters.

17:30.549 --> 17:33.652
At least that should be
all that matters to you.

17:40.292 --> 17:44.596
-How can I contact you?
-Don't worry about that.

18:22.501 --> 18:25.270
New telephone number.
God.

19:09.615 --> 19:10.682
See you later.

19:38.577 --> 19:41.380
-Are you Mr. Muñoz?
-Yes, that's right.

19:43.182 --> 19:47.252
I'm Lucio Valrossa.
I'm a train driver.

19:48.387 --> 19:50.355
I drove the train
that hit your son.

19:51.757 --> 19:54.193
What are you doing here?

19:54.593 --> 19:56.395
How did you know
where I worked?

19:56.962 --> 19:58.730
I've had your address
for quite some time.

19:59.231 --> 20:00.899
I never had the courage
to come and see you.

20:02.601 --> 20:04.603
-What do you want?
-To say something to you.

20:06.071 --> 20:08.373
You may not like it
but I have to.

20:10.375 --> 20:11.944
Go ahead.

20:12.010 --> 20:14.213
That day I was not supposed
to drive the train.

20:15.847 --> 20:17.783
That was not my shift.

20:17.849 --> 20:18.917
I was filling in
for a co-worker.

20:18.984 --> 20:19.918
He had a wedding.

20:21.086 --> 20:24.189
It was not my choice.

20:25.657 --> 20:28.961
Your son was the fourth person
I hit.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.164
There were six in all.
All suicides.

20:33.565 --> 20:35.867
But it was different with Pablo.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.103
What?

20:39.137 --> 20:43.542
There was something
in his eyes...

20:44.176 --> 20:45.644
I could never forget.

20:46.812 --> 20:49.248
Every time I dreamed about him,

20:49.314 --> 20:53.418
I felt he wanted
to ask me to forgive him.

20:54.319 --> 20:58.557
For sentencing me
to a life full of nightmares.

20:59.858 --> 21:03.695
But not anymore.

21:05.197 --> 21:06.698
I think he regretted it.

21:08.133 --> 21:09.668
He didn't want to kill himself.

21:15.374 --> 21:16.541
Go away.

21:18.477 --> 21:19.811
Just go.

22:23.108 --> 22:25.310
Why did he want to meet me
and tell me all those things?

22:25.711 --> 22:27.679
I don't know
what those people think.

22:27.746 --> 22:28.780
But I can't take it anymore.

22:32.217 --> 22:33.352
How is Rafa, Fede?

22:33.885 --> 22:35.654
I have no idea.
I didn't go to hospital.

22:36.154 --> 22:37.856
First I followed you.
And then I followed García.

22:38.490 --> 22:41.693
I've recognized the building
he went into.

22:42.060 --> 22:44.563
Some years ago, we handled
a case for a company...

22:44.629 --> 22:49.234
operating here.
A money laundering case.

22:49.868 --> 22:52.871
Your father was
in charge of it himself.

22:53.872 --> 22:55.340
García told me
he knew my father.

22:56.875 --> 22:59.177
I can't believe
he defended that bastard.

23:09.821 --> 23:12.391
-What are you doing?
-Some calculations.

23:14.059 --> 23:16.528
-It's on.
-When?

23:16.928 --> 23:18.196
Tonight.
Get the boys ready.

23:19.231 --> 23:22.033
-Fine.
-Make sure it's a good show.

23:22.534 --> 23:25.670
Offer them more money.
Maybe 5,000 or even 10,000.

23:26.471 --> 23:29.074
-Who will pay for that?
-No one.

24:23.995 --> 24:25.430
Why are you still here?

24:26.998 --> 24:28.467
I'm looking for an old case.

24:28.533 --> 24:29.801
I thought
it was in electronic format.

24:31.036 --> 24:34.172
I know you love Verónica.
You're faithful to her.

24:34.873 --> 24:36.775
But the only one who can
help her is me.

24:37.275 --> 24:38.510
You saw what happened
at the police station.

24:38.944 --> 24:42.180
-What did you promise them?
-Nothing. I never do.

24:42.647 --> 24:44.115
One good turn deserves another.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.585
They know me.
I don't like to owe favors.

24:49.921 --> 24:51.490
Then there is not much more
I can say.

24:52.791 --> 24:54.493
I've just got her out of jail.

24:55.694 --> 24:58.230
The man she hit is in the ICU.
There is a dead person.

24:58.997 --> 25:02.501
I'm worried because my daughter
doesn't call me.

25:04.369 --> 25:05.937
I'm looking for a case.
Money laundering.

25:06.004 --> 25:07.405
In 2010.
Juan García.

25:09.140 --> 25:10.408
What does he have to do
with this?

25:10.809 --> 25:12.077
He's fully involved in it.

25:12.777 --> 25:15.914
Tell Verónica to stop.
She shouldn't mess with him.

25:15.981 --> 25:17.349
That guy is very dangerous.

25:17.782 --> 25:19.050
Do you have the binder, Aaron?

25:19.518 --> 25:20.952
No, it must be
in the file cabinet.

25:23.788 --> 25:25.891
So all I can say
is that you should help her.

26:16.408 --> 26:20.779
Thanks. I've been looking
for the case everywhere.

26:22.514 --> 26:24.382
Isn't everything
in electronic format?

26:24.783 --> 26:26.284
Yes, that's
the weird thing about it.

26:28.987 --> 26:30.722
-I've just run into your father.
-So?

26:32.924 --> 26:34.092
He is not a fool.

26:34.693 --> 26:36.528
He is suspicious.
You should talk to him.

26:36.995 --> 26:38.129
Fine, I'll do it.

26:38.997 --> 26:40.465
Do you know anything
about Rafa?

26:41.466 --> 26:43.935
Yes, he'll be released shortly.

26:44.669 --> 26:47.706
He is not feeling well.
He feels responsible...

26:47.772 --> 26:49.608
for the death
of his Chinese friend.

26:51.009 --> 26:52.677
How are you doing with the D.A.?

26:54.145 --> 26:55.413
Have you called off
the competition?

26:55.847 --> 26:56.881
No, I haven't.

26:57.482 --> 26:59.918
I can only keep Dientes
from going.

27:00.318 --> 27:02.020
I can't call off
the competition.

27:02.420 --> 27:04.522
I guess those guys
will carry it out anyway.

27:04.956 --> 27:06.591
If it's not with Dientes,
they'll find somebody else.

27:08.126 --> 27:09.494
When and where will it be?

27:09.861 --> 27:11.363
I don't know.
We can wait for Rivero...

27:11.429 --> 27:14.733
to meet the boy
and then follow them.

27:15.133 --> 27:16.501
We'll have to take the risk.

27:18.870 --> 27:20.472
I've contacted
a few District Attorneys.

27:20.872 --> 27:22.040
But none of them
is ready to cooperate.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.943
The few ones I know and trust
don't want to do it...

27:25.010 --> 27:26.344
if there is no evidence.

27:26.845 --> 27:27.946
Damn!

27:29.547 --> 27:34.586
-So?
-Wait for 24 hours.

27:35.220 --> 27:36.988
If García cancels
the competition,

27:37.055 --> 27:38.823
you can call him to say
you accept the deal.

27:39.190 --> 27:41.526
At least, we'll have
Palma and Rivero.

27:41.860 --> 27:43.862
It may not be like that.
Lucio may be right.

27:44.262 --> 27:46.798
García may have everything ready
and continue all the same.

27:49.034 --> 27:51.136
Then we should go
and make a film of it.

27:52.170 --> 27:53.371
The two of us.

27:53.938 --> 27:55.306
Everything will be easier
if we have evidence.

27:56.107 --> 27:57.409
As you just said,
if we don't take the risk...

27:57.475 --> 27:58.810
this thing will go on.

28:02.647 --> 28:03.848
What is wrong?

28:06.751 --> 28:07.986
I don't know what to do.

28:11.356 --> 28:13.591
-You're afraid.
-No, I am not.

28:13.992 --> 28:15.326
Or maybe I am.

29:04.075 --> 29:06.511
Did you hear about Malvino?
He is not coming anymore.

29:06.978 --> 29:08.213
I'll take the train engine
to the workshop for a checkup.

29:10.014 --> 29:11.416
He quit, you silly!

29:26.164 --> 29:27.298
They are really good.

29:30.802 --> 29:32.170
I prefer cheese crackers.

29:32.637 --> 29:34.806
-They are more expensive.
-I know.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.459
-Let's go.
-You didn't call me.

29:54.859 --> 29:56.728
No, I didn't.
Is your friend back?

29:57.128 --> 29:58.696
-No, he isn't.
-Okay, get on.

30:07.138 --> 30:09.607
This is not your fault, Rafa.

30:09.974 --> 30:13.077
I know, Verónica.
But I feel responsible.

30:13.611 --> 30:15.146
I can't stop thinking
about that.

30:16.514 --> 30:18.149
When will you be released?

30:18.483 --> 30:22.220
In a couple of days.
I don't really care.

30:22.787 --> 30:24.522
Are you alone
or with your daughter?

30:25.390 --> 30:26.691
She is about to arrive.

30:27.392 --> 30:28.526
Take care, Rafa.

30:28.993 --> 30:30.628
Do you know
anything about the kids?

30:30.995 --> 30:34.332
What about Dientes?
Will the competition be held?

30:34.766 --> 30:38.703
We need to catch those bastards.
I have to go now.

30:40.305 --> 30:44.008
Hello, honey.
How are you?

30:44.542 --> 30:46.711
-Fine. And you?
-Good.

30:47.045 --> 30:51.516
-Hello. How are you?
-Quite well.

30:53.718 --> 30:55.286
Mom said you can live
at home with us...

30:55.353 --> 30:56.521
after you leave hospital.

30:56.921 --> 30:58.223
I didn't say that, Martina.

30:58.590 --> 31:02.727
I said you can stay at home
until you get well.

31:02.794 --> 31:04.095
If you want.

31:05.096 --> 31:07.332
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

31:21.613 --> 31:22.513
Hello?

31:22.881 --> 31:24.115
They took him away.
He is gone.

31:24.983 --> 31:25.917
Who is this?
Dientes?

31:26.284 --> 31:28.219
No, it's Peque.
They took Dientes away.

31:28.553 --> 31:29.854
Who was it?

31:30.221 --> 31:32.423
Rivero. Who else?
He and the bald guy...

31:32.490 --> 31:34.192
took him to the competition.
To the tracks.

31:34.559 --> 31:36.461
When was that?
Damn!

31:51.743 --> 31:53.111
Where are we going?

31:56.014 --> 31:58.383
-Give me your mobile phone.
-I don't have it.

31:58.716 --> 32:01.419
-Why not?
-I left it at home.

32:01.853 --> 32:03.388
You were supposed
to wait for my call.

32:05.156 --> 32:06.391
I'll give it back to you
later on.

32:22.473 --> 32:23.341
Hi, Fede.

32:23.875 --> 32:25.710
Vero, there is something
I haven't told you.

32:26.577 --> 32:29.414
The bullet report confirmed
it came from Lucio's gun.

32:29.747 --> 32:31.082
What?

32:31.149 --> 32:33.217
The gun'd been examined
because of Carranza's death.

32:33.551 --> 32:36.654
They compared the bullets
and the striations matched.

32:36.988 --> 32:38.489
How could they compare
both bullets?

32:38.856 --> 32:40.558
I have no idea.
Someone told them.

32:40.625 --> 32:43.094
They knew where to look.
Put the seatbelt on.

32:43.561 --> 32:45.196
-Who told them? García?
-I don't know.

32:45.563 --> 32:46.864
It looks like someone
owed somebody a favor.

33:05.283 --> 33:07.618
-Where are we going?
-Same place as last time.

33:08.820 --> 33:09.954
That one?

33:10.822 --> 33:12.657
There was no time
to find another one.

33:16.561 --> 33:17.662
Damn!

33:17.729 --> 33:19.130
How the hell
are we going to find them?

33:19.197 --> 33:20.498
They can be anywhere.

33:20.565 --> 33:21.766
-No, I know where they can be.
-I'm very confused.

33:22.133 --> 33:23.768
You shouldn't be.
Look at the map.

33:23.835 --> 33:27.338
The previous competitions
took place in these areas.

33:27.405 --> 33:28.473
They must be
in any of these three places.

33:28.806 --> 33:30.441
Hurry up!

34:24.062 --> 34:26.531
Listen to me.
It is good news for you.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.166
How much money did I say
I'd give you?

34:28.599 --> 34:30.168
-One thousand.
-Now it's 10,000.

34:30.668 --> 34:33.471
But it must be
an excellent show.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.006
I don't want you to jump off...

34:35.072 --> 34:36.140
as soon as you see
the train is coming.

34:37.642 --> 34:38.810
I won't.

34:38.876 --> 34:40.144
What if he does?
What if he gets scared?

34:40.211 --> 34:41.679
You'll jump off.
You're already the winner.

34:42.013 --> 34:44.348
-Will you get scared?
-No, I won't.

34:44.415 --> 34:46.017
-And you?
-Me neither.

34:46.350 --> 34:49.187
Fine.
Let the bravest win.

34:53.758 --> 34:55.126
The next one is Berazategui.

34:55.193 --> 34:57.695
It's usually full of people.
It should be less crowded.

34:58.262 --> 35:00.765
This one. Go straight ahead
until you see the bridge.

35:01.866 --> 35:03.668
Run away while you can.

35:03.734 --> 35:05.103
You should do that, asshole.

35:05.470 --> 35:08.272
-I won't!
-Come on!

35:08.339 --> 35:10.041
The train isn't coming yet.
Do it now.

35:10.842 --> 35:13.845
Jump!
Quickly!

35:14.278 --> 35:17.849
I'll beat you.
You're a chicken.

35:18.182 --> 35:20.118
Listen to me.
Jump now.

35:20.184 --> 35:22.220
Shut up!

35:23.554 --> 35:25.923
-Shut up, you fool!
-I told you to shut up.

35:26.257 --> 35:27.325
Which is the next one?

35:28.226 --> 35:30.795
The one after Hudson.
We're wasting time.

35:30.862 --> 35:32.396
It could be
any other branch line.

35:32.463 --> 35:34.599
We're not wasting time.
We're doing our best.

35:34.665 --> 35:36.234
They couldn't have changed
the branch line.

35:52.183 --> 35:53.518
Damn!

36:22.046 --> 36:23.447
What are you doing?

36:23.981 --> 36:25.950
Tolosa crossing.
Where Vincen died.

36:26.284 --> 36:27.752
-What about it?
-It's still closed.

36:28.553 --> 36:30.655
It doesn't necessarily mean
they'll do it there.

36:30.988 --> 36:32.356
That is the place, Fede.

36:32.890 --> 36:35.193
I'm sure they'll do it
