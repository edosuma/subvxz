WEBVTT

00:27.986 --> 00:29.904
<i> What is it that haunts you?</i>

00:31.489 --> 00:34.743
<i>Whose eyes peer at you from the dark?</i>

00:49.466 --> 00:50.341
No.

00:54.846 --> 00:55.805
<i> Flames.</i>

00:56.389 --> 00:58.058
W… what did you say?

00:59.309 --> 01:03.480
I'd like to have flames
added to the pant leg.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.483
You want flames on your outfit?

01:06.566 --> 01:07.525
Yes.

01:08.985 --> 01:11.446
I don't think that's a good idea.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.948
What's the issue?

01:14.532 --> 01:19.704
Mr. Mishima, the young man has requested
a flame design on his new trainers.

01:19.788 --> 01:23.458
Slightly arrogant, sir.
It will make him a target.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.543
He's already a target.

01:26.294 --> 01:27.712
He is Mishima.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.716
Many will come to challenge his legacy.

01:32.258 --> 01:34.010
And when he fights them,

01:34.094 --> 01:39.224
what is or isn't on his uniform
will be the least of their concerns.

01:39.307 --> 01:44.979
However, your opinion
is acknowledged, Miss Miura.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.316
No flames.

01:49.776 --> 01:52.320
You will find nothing here is given.

01:52.821 --> 01:56.241
Everything that will come to you
must be earned.

01:56.825 --> 01:58.660
You will pay in sweat

01:59.244 --> 02:02.705
and sometimes… in blood.

02:03.748 --> 02:08.586
Time to begin your training.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.272
The moment you step into that ring,

03:51.898 --> 03:54.567
you're not to turn your back on anyone,

03:55.235 --> 03:57.111
not even me.

03:58.029 --> 04:03.243
Teacher, student, friend, lover.

04:03.868 --> 04:06.788
In the ring, none of that matters.

04:09.123 --> 04:10.625
Yes, sir.

04:12.418 --> 04:15.964
The Kazama fighting style
your mother taught you

04:16.047 --> 04:18.132
serves as a foundation,

04:18.883 --> 04:20.635
a warm-up at best,

04:21.844 --> 04:24.973
but it is not Mishima style.

04:25.473 --> 04:27.517
The real training,

04:28.268 --> 04:31.980
the real fighting, starts today.

04:32.981 --> 04:36.651
These two lanterns
were gifts from my father,

04:37.568 --> 04:39.612
Jinpachi Mishima.

04:40.321 --> 04:43.908
He hired
the most skilled stone cutter in Japan,

04:45.076 --> 04:47.078
a master at his trade,

04:47.578 --> 04:52.041
commissioned to create
two exquisite lanterns.

04:52.125 --> 04:55.670
Wh… what… what happened to that one?

04:55.753 --> 05:02.010
When Jinpachi, your great-grandfather,
presented the stone lanterns to me,

05:02.510 --> 05:05.430
he shattered one with his bare hand.

05:06.931 --> 05:11.853
It was a demonstration
that we Mishima have great power.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.355
The power to build

05:15.398 --> 05:18.276
or the power to destroy.

05:19.277 --> 05:22.113
I keep the two lanterns as he intended,

05:23.031 --> 05:26.075
to remind myself of that lesson.

05:27.785 --> 05:31.039
I'm going to tear you down completely,

05:32.206 --> 05:36.461
then I will build you back up

05:36.544 --> 05:39.464
as only a Mishima can.

05:39.547 --> 05:42.592
This is the only way.

05:43.134 --> 05:46.304
This is how you defeat Ogre.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.307
When the pain is too much,

05:49.974 --> 05:53.186
or you're too weak
to get back on your feet,

05:53.978 --> 05:58.483
think of your helplessness
when Ogre killed your mother,

05:59.025 --> 06:02.362
and let the anger
that comes with that memory

06:02.445 --> 06:05.448
lift you back up.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.037
<i> For this lesson,</i>

06:11.913 --> 06:14.832
<i>you're only to use hand techniques.</i>

06:16.209 --> 06:18.252
<i>Only upper body.</i>

06:19.420 --> 06:20.755
<i>No kicking,</i>

06:22.006 --> 06:23.758
<i>no legs.</i>

06:24.759 --> 06:27.178
Now, attack.

06:33.810 --> 06:37.021
I thought we were only using
our hand techniques today.

06:37.605 --> 06:40.358
You are only using your hands.

06:41.234 --> 06:45.029
I will use whatever I see fit.

06:45.613 --> 06:49.659
You should already know
that life is not fair.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.537
Fighting is not fair.

06:53.162 --> 06:55.957
We use whatever we can.

07:02.255 --> 07:05.550
Up. On your feet.

07:08.594 --> 07:09.679
Hmm.

07:14.016 --> 07:17.395
When you've proven yourself
with your upper body,

07:18.187 --> 07:23.317
we will move on to your kicks, sweeps,
use of your knees.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.487
Everything below the belt.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.448
Understood?

07:30.324 --> 07:32.743
Yes, sir.

07:32.827 --> 07:35.621
Then, when I'm satisfied,

07:36.539 --> 07:39.208
all your techniques will be combined.

07:39.709 --> 07:43.963
Every fiber of your body, top to bottom,

07:44.547 --> 07:46.841
will be Mishima style.

07:47.341 --> 07:49.010
Understood?

07:49.594 --> 07:53.306
From now on,
you will be conditioning your body.

07:54.056 --> 07:58.728
Hardening it, strengthening it,
tempering it.

07:59.353 --> 08:02.064
Your body itself will be a weapon.

08:03.107 --> 08:06.903
Your blocks will do as much damage
as your strikes,

08:07.403 --> 08:11.282
your defensive techniques
as painful as your offensive.

08:12.366 --> 08:13.910
Understood?

09:51.882 --> 09:57.263
Now, demonstrate to me
your power and focus.

09:57.346 --> 09:59.223
Sir?

10:02.435 --> 10:05.980
I want to see your breaking ability.

10:10.067 --> 10:11.485
Focus.

10:25.833 --> 10:29.420
We are finished for today.

10:45.102 --> 10:46.604
When we're finished,

10:47.605 --> 10:52.652
Mishima style will break
what your Kazama style could not.

10:53.152 --> 10:55.946
Yes, sir.

10:56.030 --> 10:57.782
-Get cleaned up.
-Huh?

10:58.366 --> 11:03.037
You're going to a dinner meeting… with me.

11:07.625 --> 11:13.255
When I talk business to anyone,
you are not to speak unless spoken to.

11:14.048 --> 11:15.091
Understood?

11:16.634 --> 11:17.468
Yes, sir.

11:17.551 --> 11:22.014
Order whatever you want,
as long as it's healthy.

11:23.182 --> 11:27.269
Strong body, strong mind.

11:27.353 --> 11:28.312
What?

11:28.396 --> 11:31.524
Something… my mom used to say.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.484
For the most part,

11:34.819 --> 11:36.487
she was a wise woman.

11:37.363 --> 11:40.241
Your guest has arrived, sir.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.869
Good evening, Mr. Mishima.

11:44.453 --> 11:46.205
Thank you, Ganryu.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.125
We found it, Mr. Mishima.

11:49.750 --> 11:54.130
Sure enough, my guys actually found it.

11:58.217 --> 12:01.262
Uh…

12:01.345 --> 12:06.726
Mr. Mishima, there were some…
…unexpected expenses.

12:07.601 --> 12:10.646
-I was hoping you could--
-Hoping what?

12:10.730 --> 12:14.692
A price was agreed upon
when you accepted the job.

12:15.484 --> 12:17.987
I won't ask again.

12:19.321 --> 12:21.741
If Chang's pendant is so valuable,

12:22.700 --> 12:24.577
I'll just find another buyer.

12:24.660 --> 12:28.497
Jin, take the pendant from this trash

12:28.581 --> 12:31.208
and show him with your fists

12:31.292 --> 12:33.919
what happens to those who cross us.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.004
Uh…

12:36.046 --> 12:37.006
Take it?

12:37.089 --> 12:41.427
Forcing a child
to do your dirty work, Heihachi?

12:42.845 --> 12:46.098
You're not worth my time.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.850
And, Jin,

12:48.809 --> 12:51.437
remember your training.

13:11.040 --> 13:11.874
Good.

13:13.083 --> 13:15.461
Now, finish him.

13:15.544 --> 13:18.172
-Finish him?
-No.

13:22.927 --> 13:23.761
Good.

13:25.554 --> 13:28.808
But… you hesitated.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.101
Uh… I know. It's just…

13:31.185 --> 13:33.312
Hesitation is a weakness

13:33.896 --> 13:36.899
and most likely what killed your mother.

13:37.399 --> 13:41.862
You will never beat Ogre with… hesitation.

13:44.365 --> 13:45.533
Yes, sir.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.786
In order to defeat him,

13:48.869 --> 13:52.206
you must purge the Kazama pacifism

13:52.289 --> 13:55.417
and stoke your Mishima fire.

14:02.508 --> 14:05.761
Tomorrow, we move on to the next level.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.681
Understood?

14:10.683 --> 14:11.851
<i> Yes, sir.</i>

14:16.689 --> 14:19.859
I want our scientists
to examine this artifact.

14:20.818 --> 14:23.946
I want to know everything about it.

14:25.364 --> 14:26.198
Yes, sir.

14:26.699 --> 14:29.243
Do you believe the legends, sir?

14:29.326 --> 14:32.872
That it can detect spirits such as Ogre?

14:32.955 --> 14:34.081
<i>Hai</i>.

14:34.164 --> 14:38.294
That is what I pay
our scientists to determine.

14:39.962 --> 14:42.631
Here for the afternoon training, sir.

14:43.340 --> 14:44.383
H… have a seat.

14:44.967 --> 14:45.968
No, Jin.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.471
Sitting stance until I'm finished here.

14:52.474 --> 14:53.767
By the way,

14:53.851 --> 14:58.147
this may be related, sir,
from what we can tell.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.982
More have gone missing.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.401
Baek Doo San.

15:02.484 --> 15:04.028
Wang Jinrei.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.405
Okay. Here.

15:06.488 --> 15:11.911
Reports from our contacts in Mexico City
say King has… vanished.

15:12.661 --> 15:13.579
And Lee?

15:14.538 --> 15:16.957
None of our people have seen him?

15:17.041 --> 15:18.417
Lee Chaolan?

15:19.001 --> 15:20.669
Mmm, not as of yet, sir.

15:20.753 --> 15:24.506
If any more fighters
of an advanced skill go missing,

15:25.341 --> 15:26.884
I want to know about it.

15:27.801 --> 15:30.262
Yes, sir. Of course, sir.

15:30.346 --> 15:32.681
That will be all.

15:34.266 --> 15:38.771
The roots of Mishima style
are beginning to take hold,

15:39.897 --> 15:42.024
but you must go further.

15:42.858 --> 15:46.862
Mishima style must be part
of your every instinct.

15:46.946 --> 15:52.201
Sir, the other fighters,
those who are missing,

15:52.284 --> 15:55.329
is it the same as my mom? Is it Ogre?

15:55.412 --> 15:58.082
Instead of worrying about Ogre,

15:58.165 --> 16:04.213
I suggest you first concern yourself
with surviving your training… with me.

16:08.801 --> 16:13.889
Eventually, you'll either walk
out of this room on your own two feet,

16:14.390 --> 16:16.100
ready to defeat Ogre,

16:16.600 --> 16:20.062
or you'll be dragged out of here,

16:20.896 --> 16:25.317
shamed and unworthy
of the name Mishima or Kazama.

16:26.568 --> 16:28.487
It's up to you.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.782
Are you ready?

16:33.701 --> 16:34.743
Yes, sir.

16:34.827 --> 16:35.828
Arms down.

16:36.537 --> 16:40.040
You must learn to evade
when you're unable to block.

16:40.124 --> 16:42.960
Time to use those legs.

16:48.549 --> 16:49.717
Up.

16:54.596 --> 16:55.723
<i> Never stay down.</i>

16:57.182 --> 16:58.976
<i>Down means I'm finished.</i>

17:18.537 --> 17:19.371
Hmm.

18:29.983 --> 18:31.902
At the end of each lesson,

18:32.653 --> 18:35.489
you must fight your way past me to leave.

18:35.989 --> 18:37.616
The day you get past me

18:37.699 --> 18:40.661
and walk out of this room
on your own two feet,

18:41.245 --> 18:44.623
your training is complete.

18:45.499 --> 18:47.417
Understood?

18:47.918 --> 18:48.877
Yes, sir.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.257
Class dismissed.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.937
See you tomorrow.

20:43.909 --> 20:45.494
You've learned much.

20:46.286 --> 20:49.581
Yet all that I see in front of me
is the frightened child

20:49.665 --> 20:53.961
who snuck into my headquarters
four years ago.

20:54.461 --> 20:57.047
From the day I began training you,

20:58.548 --> 21:03.220
I've had a plan to bring back
the King of Iron Fist Tournament

21:04.137 --> 21:07.849
and use it to lure Ogre out into the open.

21:10.811 --> 21:14.314
But it is useless
to announce the tournament

21:14.398 --> 21:19.069
and lure the monster for you to challenge
if you cannot beat him.

21:20.279 --> 21:23.198
You must not only fight him as Mishima

21:23.824 --> 21:26.118
but also win as Mishima.

21:27.244 --> 21:30.956
Class… dismissed.

21:34.793 --> 21:35.669
Hmm.

21:53.020 --> 21:54.229
Weak.

21:55.272 --> 21:56.273
Pathetic.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.034
Hmm…

22:53.997 --> 22:55.957
I forgot something.

22:59.044 --> 22:59.961
Hmm?

23:07.552 --> 23:08.595
Hmm…

23:15.560 --> 23:17.479
Now they match.

23:26.321 --> 23:30.951
<i> Miss Miura, begin preparations.</i>

23:32.202 --> 23:33.370
<i>It's time</i>

23:34.204 --> 23:39.459
<i>for the next King of Iron Fist Tournament.</i>
