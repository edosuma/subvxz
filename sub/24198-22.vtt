WEBVTT

00:08.770 --> 00:11.640
>>> WELCOME TO THE JIM JEFFRIES
SHOW.

00:11.641 --> 00:18.497
THE REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO PUT A SECOND
ACCUSED SEX OFFENDER ON THE SUPREME COURT.

00:18.500 --> 00:28.047
THE FIRST BEING RUTH BADER GINSBURG WHO
ONCE GOT MY BALLS INTO 24 HOUR FITNESS.

00:28.050 --> 00:30.570
I TALK ABOUT THE AMERICAN WORK
ETHIC, THAT'S COMING UP, LET'S

00:30.571 --> 00:37.149
GET THE SHOW STARTED.

00:37.150 --> 00:46.020
GET THE SHOW STARTED.

00:51.120 --> 00:53.429
>>> GOOD EVENING, WELCOME TO THE

00:53.430 --> 00:56.079
JIM JEFFRIES SHOW, I'M JIM

00:56.080 --> 00:58.049
JEFFERYS, THE BIG STORY OF THE

00:58.050 --> 01:00.149
WEEK IS THE SEXUAL ASSAULT

01:00.150 --> 01:02.019
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST SUPREME

01:02.020 --> 01:05.049
COURT NOMINEE BRETT KAVANAUGH.

01:05.050 --> 01:06.459
HOW MANY JUSTICES ACCUSED OF SEX

01:06.460 --> 01:07.769
OFFENSES CAN YOU HAVE ON THE

01:07.770 --> 01:09.259
BENCH AT ONE TIME.

01:09.260 --> 01:12.119
THE ANSWER IS NINE.

01:12.120 --> 01:14.359
TECHNICALLY YOU CAN HAVE NINE.

01:14.360 --> 01:15.529
DR. CHRISTINE FORD, THE FIRST

01:15.530 --> 01:17.569
WOMAN TO ACCUSE KAVANAUGH IS SET

01:17.570 --> 01:19.569
TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE SENATE ON

01:19.570 --> 01:21.259
THURSDAY, BUT MOST REPUBLICANS

01:21.260 --> 01:22.979
SEEM TO HAVE ALREADY MADE THEIR

01:22.980 --> 01:24.709
MINDS UP.

01:24.710 --> 01:25.290
>> DO YOU BELIEVE --

01:25.291 --> 01:27.429
>> WELL, I THINK SHE'S MISTAKEN.

01:27.430 --> 01:29.529
>> THIS HAS BEEN REALLY A DRIVE

01:29.530 --> 01:30.430
BY ATTACK.

01:30.431 --> 01:32.399
>> IS THERE REALLY ENOUGH

01:32.400 --> 01:35.119
EVIDENCE HERE, GIVEN THE NATURE

01:35.120 --> 01:39.639
OF THE ALLEGATIONS, HOW IT IS,

01:39.640 --> 01:41.119
AND THE UNCERTAIN NATURE OF IT.

01:41.120 --> 01:44.049
>> HOW OLD THE ALLEGATION IS?

01:44.050 --> 01:45.189
YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN.

01:45.190 --> 01:48.049
ALL THINGS ARE YOUR WHOLE DEAL.

01:48.050 --> 01:50.599
THE CONSTITUTION, THE BIBLE,

01:50.600 --> 01:51.190
YOU.

01:51.191 --> 01:55.049
YOU YOURSELF, ARE VERY OILED.

01:55.050 --> 01:58.289
IN THE MEANTIME, ANOTHER WOMAN

01:58.290 --> 02:00.019
HAS COME FORWARD ACCUSING

02:00.020 --> 02:01.119
KAVANAUGH OF ASSAULTING HER IN

02:01.120 --> 02:02.020
COLLEGE.

02:02.020 --> 02:02.770
REPUBLICANS ARE STILL DESPERATE

02:02.771 --> 02:07.079
TO SEE THEIR NOMINEE CONFIRMED.

02:07.080 --> 02:08.050
>> IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE.

02:08.050 --> 02:11.459
JUDGE KAVANAUGH WILL BE ON THE

02:11.460 --> 02:12.360
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.

02:12.361 --> 02:14.019
DON'T GET RATTLED BY ALL OF

02:14.020 --> 02:14.330
THIS.

02:14.331 --> 02:16.119
WE'RE GOING TO PLOW RIGHT

02:16.120 --> 02:16.570
THROUGH IT.

02:16.570 --> 02:17.430
AND DO OUR JOB.

02:17.431 --> 02:21.329
>> COME ON, MATE, CHOOSE YOUR

02:21.330 --> 02:24.669
WORDS BETTER.

02:24.670 --> 02:26.600
YES, OUR GUY --

02:27.020 --> 02:28.949
>> IS BEING ACCUSED OF SEXUAL

02:28.950 --> 02:30.259
ASSAULT, DON'T WORRY, WE'RE

02:30.260 --> 02:32.019
GOING TO RAM KAVANAUGH IN

02:32.020 --> 02:33.149
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.

02:33.150 --> 02:40.019
JUST LIE BACK AND TRY TO RELAX.

02:40.020 --> 02:42.909
SINCE DR. FORD WENT PUBLIC,

02:42.910 --> 02:44.219
WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT

02:44.220 --> 02:45.289
KAVANAUGH'S HARD DRINKING

02:45.290 --> 02:46.399
TEENAGED WAYS.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.599
HIS HIGH SCHOOL CROWD SEEMED TO

02:47.600 --> 02:49.119
HAVE SOMETHING OF A REPUTATION.

02:49.120 --> 02:51.259
>> FORTUNATELY WE HAD A -- A

02:51.260 --> 02:53.949
GOOD SAYING THAT WE'VE HELD FIRM

02:53.950 --> 02:56.329
TO TO THIS DAY AS THE DEAN WAS

02:56.330 --> 02:57.120
REMINDING ME BEFORE -- BEFORE

02:57.121 --> 02:59.359
THE TALK, WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENS

02:59.360 --> 03:01.599
AT GEORGETOWN PREP, STAYS AT

03:01.600 --> 03:02.260
GEORGETOWN PREP.

03:02.260 --> 03:03.020
THAT'S BEEN A GOOD THING FOR ALL

03:03.021 --> 03:07.670
OF US, I THINK.

03:08.080 --> 03:10.149
>> THAT WAS THE SAYING?

03:10.150 --> 03:12.499
WHAT HAPPENS HERE, STAYS HERE?

03:12.500 --> 03:14.219
IS THAT WHAT HE SAYS, WHAT

03:14.220 --> 03:16.019
HAPPENS HERE STAYS HERE IN

03:16.020 --> 03:17.079
REFERENCE TO GOOD THINGS.

03:17.080 --> 03:19.979
IT'S NOT LIKE A DOCTOR IN LAS

03:19.980 --> 03:22.119
VEGAS CURED CANCER IS LIKE, I'VE

03:22.120 --> 03:23.979
DONE IT, OH, BUT  WHY

03:23.980 --> 03:29.120
DID I DO IT IN VEGAS?

03:29.810 --> 03:30.570
I CAN'T TELL ANYONE.

03:30.570 --> 03:31.460
IF I WASN'T SUCH A STICK LETTER

03:31.461 --> 03:34.119
FOR THE RULES.

03:34.120 --> 03:36.979
KAVANAUGH SAYS HE WILL GIVE THE

03:36.980 --> 03:39.909
SENATE CALENDARS HE KEPT FROM

03:39.910 --> 03:43.839
1992 WHEN THE ASSAULT HAPPENED.

03:43.840 --> 03:45.289
IN ORDER TO DISPROVE DR. FORD'S

03:45.290 --> 03:45.910
STORY.

03:45.911 --> 03:47.949
I DIDN'T KNOW HE HAD A CALENDAR.

03:47.950 --> 03:51.289
OH, GOOD HE'S GOT A CALENDAR.

03:51.290 --> 03:56.189
WE DON'T NEED FORENSIC EVIDENCE

03:56.190 --> 03:56.600
ANY MORE.

03:56.601 --> 03:58.809
THE DNA MATCHES AND THE

03:58.810 --> 04:00.979
FINGERPRINT MATCHES, BUT THE

04:00.980 --> 04:02.119
SUSPECT'S CALENDAR SAYS NO

04:02.120 --> 04:02.880
MURDER.

04:02.881 --> 04:04.529
SO LET'S LET HIM GO HOME.

04:04.530 --> 04:06.979
>> WHY DOES HE STILL HAVE

04:06.980 --> 04:08.529
CALENDARS FROM 1982.

04:08.530 --> 04:10.459
FRANKLY, I DON'T WANT HIM ON THE

04:10.460 --> 04:12.949
SUPREME COURT JUST BECAUSE HE'S

04:12.950 --> 04:13.330
A HOARDER.

04:13.331 --> 04:15.809
THROW SOME SHIT OUT, BRETT.

04:15.810 --> 04:16.570
MAYBE YOUR SISTER WILL TALK TO

04:16.571 --> 04:22.429
YOU AGAIN.

04:22.430 --> 04:24.189
WHY NOT JUST WITHDRAW

04:24.190 --> 04:25.259
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION?

04:25.260 --> 04:26.529
WHY ARE REPUBLICANS SO WILLING

04:26.530 --> 04:29.119
TO STAND BEHIND HIM.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.459
>> THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FOR 45

04:30.460 --> 04:31.430
YEARS HAS TAKEN THE POSITION AND

04:31.431 --> 04:33.429
STILL DOES, THAT A SITTING

04:33.430 --> 04:35.879
PRESIDENT MAY NOT BE INDICTED

04:35.880 --> 04:36.840
WHILE STILL IN OFFICE.

04:36.841 --> 04:40.769
>> OH, RIGHT, NOT ONLY IS HE

04:40.770 --> 04:41.430
ANTI-CHOICE, HE'S ALSO GOT

04:41.430 --> 04:42.120
TRUMP'S BACK IN THE MUELLER

04:42.120 --> 04:42.740
INVESTIGATION.

04:42.741 --> 04:44.739
I GUESS BRETT KAVANAUGH IS ALL

04:44.740 --> 04:47.049
ABOUT FORCING PEOPLE TO KEEP

04:47.050 --> 04:48.219
THINGS THEY DON'T WANT ANY MORE.

04:48.220 --> 04:51.399
ALL THE WAY TO THE END OF TERM.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.839
IMAGINE IF YOU COULD GET RID OF

04:53.840 --> 04:57.289
TRUMP WITH TOO MUCH VITAMIN C

04:57.290 --> 04:59.359
AND A COAT HANGER.

04:59.360 --> 05:03.459
WE'RE NOT PUTTING UP A VISUAL

05:03.460 --> 05:05.080
FOR THAT?

05:05.530 --> 05:06.909
>> THIS IS THE GUY THE

05:06.910 --> 05:09.429
REPUBLICANS ARE STICKING WITH.

05:09.430 --> 05:10.909
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE HAS BEEN

05:10.910 --> 05:12.879
WITHDRAWN FOR WAY LESS.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.739
RONALD REAGAN'S NOMINEE, DOUGLAS

05:14.740 --> 05:18.019
GINSBURG HAD TO WITHDRAW WHEN IT

05:18.020 --> 05:23.019
CAME OUT THAT HE SMOKED POT.

05:23.020 --> 05:24.739
AND BEFORE THAT, THOMAS STANLEY

05:24.740 --> 05:27.399
MATTHEWS WAS DEEMED

05:27.400 --> 05:28.909
CONTROVERSIAL BECAUSE OF HIS

05:28.910 --> 05:29.330
INTERESTS.

05:29.331 --> 05:33.359
FORGET ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL

05:33.360 --> 05:33.880
ASSAULT, TRAINS!

05:33.881 --> 05:40.769
WHICH MAKES ME WONDER.

05:40.770 --> 05:42.739
HAS ANYONE ASKED BRETT KAVANAUGH

05:42.740 --> 05:44.019
ABOUT HIS RAILROAD INTERESTS?

05:44.020 --> 05:46.149
I'M SURE IF WE TOOK A GOOD LOOK

05:46.150 --> 05:53.879
AT HIS CALENDAR WE'D -- OH, NO.

05:53.880 --> 05:55.599
I KNEW IT.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.149
THAT SETTLES IT, CALL YOUR

05:57.150 --> 06:00.119
SENATORS, HAVE A FULL

06:00.120 --> 06:03.329
INVESTIGATION INTO BRETT

06:03.330 --> 06:04.359
KAVANAUGH'S RAILROAD INTEREST.

06:04.360 --> 06:07.769
THE GOP MAY BE ABLE TO OVERLOOK

06:07.770 --> 06:10.019
MULTIPLE INCIDENTS OF SEXUAL

06:10.020 --> 06:11.189
ASSAULT, BUT WAIT UNTIL THEY

06:11.190 --> 06:12.329
FIND OUT BRETT KAVANAUGH IS A

06:12.330 --> 06:24.050
CABOOSE LOVER.

06:25.840 --> 06:26.770
>>> WELCOME BACK.

06:26.770 --> 06:27.740
WELCOME BACK.

06:27.741 --> 06:29.219
WORK IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE

06:29.220 --> 06:30.050
AMERICAN IDENTITY.

06:30.051 --> 06:31.189
WHEN YOU MEET SOMEONE AT A

06:31.190 --> 06:32.839
PARTY, THE FIRST QUESTION IS

06:32.840 --> 06:36.329
ALWAYS, WHAT DO YOU DO?

06:36.330 --> 06:37.359
I USED TO DELIGHT PEOPLE WHEN I

06:37.360 --> 06:42.709
WAS YOUNGER, I WOULD TELL THEM I

06:42.710 --> 06:44.709
WAS A GIRAFFE KEEPER AT THE ZOO.

06:44.710 --> 06:48.909
THE GIRAFFE TONGUE IS SO STRONG,

06:48.910 --> 06:50.839
IT CAN TEAR THE SKIN OFF A HUMAN

06:50.840 --> 06:51.770
BODY.

06:51.771 --> 06:54.739
THAT'S WHY THERE'S NO LESBIAN

06:54.740 --> 06:55.769
GIRAFFES.

06:55.770 --> 07:00.149
ALSO, THEY DON'T MAKE SENSIBLE

07:00.150 --> 07:01.329
PANTS FOR FOUR LEGS.

07:01.330 --> 07:03.709
LET'S FOUND OUT IN OUR SEGMENT,

07:03.710 --> 07:09.049
AMERICA, YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG.

07:09.050 --> 07:09.400
OKAY.

07:09.401 --> 07:10.809
THE COUNTRY'S OBSESSION WITH

07:10.810 --> 07:13.289
HARD WORK DATES BACK TO THE

07:13.290 --> 07:15.809
BIBLE THUMPING  WHO

07:15.810 --> 07:18.049
INVENTED THE PROTESTANT WORK

07:18.050 --> 07:18.400
ETHIC.

07:18.401 --> 07:21.329
WHY IS IT CALLED A WORK ETHIC?

07:21.330 --> 07:24.049
WORK IS INHERENTLY ETHICAL.

07:24.050 --> 07:26.329
YOU CAN BE A HARDWORKING HUMAN

07:26.330 --> 07:27.599
TRAFFICKER, AND NO ONE'S GOING

07:27.600 --> 07:31.219
TO SAY, GOING TO HAND IT TO

07:31.220 --> 07:36.149
NIKKO LA, EVERY MORNING CRAMMING

07:36.150 --> 07:37.809
WOMEN INTO SHIPPING CONTAINERS.

07:37.810 --> 07:39.019
HE ALWAYS MAKES THEM FIT.

07:39.020 --> 07:40.839
HE HAS GOOD ETHICS.

07:40.840 --> 07:42.809
HARD WORK JUST FOR THE SAKE OF

07:42.810 --> 07:44.189
WORKING HARD IS STUPID.

07:44.190 --> 07:45.529
YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL DEAD AT THE

07:45.530 --> 07:48.809
END OF THIS, RIGHT?

07:48.810 --> 07:50.019
IT'S NOT LIKE HARD WORK IS

07:50.020 --> 07:50.710
QUALITY WORK.

07:50.711 --> 07:54.599
>> COMPARED TO OTHER HIGHLY

07:54.600 --> 07:56.599
INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.709
THE UNITED STATES HAS ONE OF THE

07:58.710 --> 08:01.639
LONGEST WORKWEEK, LONG WEEK

08:01.640 --> 08:04.189
HOURS TEND TO HAVE AN ADVERSE

08:04.190 --> 08:05.709
EFFECT ON PRODUCTIVITY.

08:05.710 --> 08:06.879
>> I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TELL THAT

08:06.880 --> 08:10.709
TO COMEDY CENTRAL, THEY SAY THEY

08:10.710 --> 08:13.219
DON'T HAVE MONTHLY SHOWS.

08:13.220 --> 08:15.739
THE 40 HOUR WORKWEEK IS MAKING

08:15.740 --> 08:17.499
US LESS PRODUCTIVE AND RUINING

08:17.500 --> 08:18.500
OUR PERSONAL LIVES.

08:18.501 --> 08:20.709
>> THE AVERAGE AMERICAN WITH AT

08:20.710 --> 08:22.219
LEAST ONE CHILD SPENDS NEARLY

08:22.220 --> 08:24.529
NINE HOURS A DAY ENGAGED IN

08:24.530 --> 08:26.669
WORK, LESS THAN THREE HOURS FOR

08:26.670 --> 08:29.019
LEISURE, AND 1.2 CARING FOR

08:29.020 --> 08:29.570
OTHERS.

08:29.571 --> 08:32.219
PERHAPS THE MOST STUNNING PART

08:32.220 --> 08:33.909
OF OUR INSANELY INTENSE WORK

08:33.909 --> 08:35.669
CULTURE, THIS COUNTRY DOES NOT

08:35.669 --> 08:38.019
REQUIRE COMPANIES TO OFFER

08:38.020 --> 08:38.840
PARENTAL LEAVE.

08:38.841 --> 08:40.769
>> THEY STOPPED DOING LA HAS

08:40.770 --> 08:43.639
CLASSES AND JUST STARTING TO

08:43.640 --> 08:45.839
TEACH WOMEN NOT LET CONTRACTIONS

08:45.840 --> 08:46.600
DISRUPT THEIR PRESENTATION.

08:46.601 --> 08:49.639
AND AS YOU CAN SEE, WE'RE DOING

08:49.640 --> 08:50.290
MUCH BETTER IN THE FOURTH

08:50.291 --> 08:54.570
QUARTER.

08:55.670 --> 08:58.639
>> OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S A JOKE.

08:58.640 --> 09:01.709
IN MY EXPERIENCE, CHILDBIRTH IS

09:01.710 --> 09:02.640
EASY.

09:02.641 --> 09:03.979
AMERICAN YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG.

09:03.980 --> 09:06.599
IT'S TIME TO RETHINK THE WAY WE

09:06.600 --> 09:08.219
WORK, BECAUSE HAPPY WORKERS ARE

09:08.220 --> 09:09.529
BETTER WORKERS.

09:09.530 --> 09:11.119
COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD ARE

09:11.120 --> 09:12.709
EXPERIMENTING WITH A FOUR DAY

09:12.710 --> 09:13.530
WORKWEEK.

09:13.531 --> 09:16.429
>> AT A NEW ZEALAND FINANCIAL

09:16.430 --> 09:17.769
SERVICES FIRM, STARTING NEXT

09:17.770 --> 09:19.569
MONTH, THEY WILL BE IMPLEMENTING

09:19.570 --> 09:21.429
A PERMANENT FOUR-DAY WORKWEEK,

09:21.430 --> 09:24.429
AFTER A SUCCESSFUL TRIAL THIS

09:24.430 --> 09:24.880
PAST SPRING.

09:24.881 --> 09:26.079
STRESS LEVELS DURING THAT TIME

09:26.080 --> 09:29.049
ARE REDUCED BY 7%, 78% OF

09:29.050 --> 09:31.019
EMPLOYEES SAY THEY COULD MANAGE

09:31.020 --> 09:32.569
THEIR WORK LIFE BALANCE BETTER,

09:32.570 --> 09:35.119
AND SOCIAL MEDIA SURFING DROPPED

09:35.120 --> 09:37.119
BY 35%.

09:37.120 --> 09:41.459
>> OKAY, I SUPPORT A FOUR-DAY

09:41.460 --> 09:41.880
WORKWEEK.

09:41.881 --> 09:43.399
BUT THE FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRM

09:43.400 --> 09:44.909
IN NEW ZEALAND.

09:44.910 --> 09:46.909
HOW MUCH WORK DO THEY REALLY

09:46.910 --> 09:47.530
HAVE?

09:47.531 --> 09:49.569
THEY ONLY HAVE ABOUT $5 IN THE

09:49.570 --> 09:50.530
ENTIRE COUNTRY.

09:50.531 --> 09:52.879
IT'S LIKE, OH, KEVIN'S GOT SOME

09:52.880 --> 09:54.599
MONEY.

09:54.600 --> 09:55.530
OH, NO.

09:55.531 --> 09:57.049
DAVE'S ALSO GOT SOME MONEY.

09:57.050 --> 09:58.639
WE SHOULD -- OH, WE SHOULD PUT

09:58.640 --> 10:00.499
ALL THE PEBBLES TOGETHER AND PUT

10:00.500 --> 10:01.120
THEM IN A BIG HEAP, BRO.

10:01.121 --> 10:04.459
>> I LIKE THAT, BRO.

10:04.460 --> 10:08.739
WHAT IS FOUR PEBBLES PLUS FOUR

10:08.740 --> 10:10.459
PEBBLES?

10:10.460 --> 10:12.460
>> THAT WOULD BE SIX, BRO, SIX.

10:13.430 --> 10:18.429
>> PEBBLES ARE THEIR CURRENCY

10:18.430 --> 10:21.739
BECAUSE THEY'RE INBRED.

10:21.740 --> 10:23.429
THE WAY AMERICANS OVERWORK

10:23.430 --> 10:25.839
THEMSELVES IS LUDICROUS.

10:25.840 --> 10:27.569
EVERY OTHER COUNTRY GIVES

10:27.570 --> 10:30.399
AMERICANS FOUR WEEKS VACATION.

10:30.400 --> 10:31.879
GERMANY IS ONE OF THE MOST

10:31.880 --> 10:33.639
GENEROUS VACATION POLICIES IN

10:33.640 --> 10:35.459
THE WORLD, THEY GIVE UP TO EIGHT

10:35.460 --> 10:36.909
WEEKS AND THEY'RE THE ONES THAT

10:36.910 --> 10:38.399
LOST THE WAR.

10:38.400 --> 10:42.359
THOUGH I'M OKAY WITH THAT, TO BE

10:42.360 --> 10:43.909
HONEST.

10:43.910 --> 10:46.879
WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE THE GERMANS

10:46.880 --> 10:48.289
TO RELAX.

10:48.290 --> 10:50.359
WE SAW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY

10:50.360 --> 10:51.290
GOT UPTIGHT.

10:51.291 --> 10:52.879
AMERICA SHOULD IMPLEMENT A

10:52.880 --> 10:54.809
FOUR-DAY WORKWEEK, BUT IT WON'T

10:54.810 --> 10:56.639
IT GOES AGAINST THE AMERICAN

10:56.640 --> 10:57.909
IDEA THAT IF YOU'RE NOT KILLING

10:57.910 --> 10:59.529
YOURSELF AT WORK, YOU'RE DOING

10:59.530 --> 11:00.020
SOMETHING WRONG.

11:00.021 --> 11:02.399
I HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE

11:02.400 --> 11:03.020
SUGGESTION.

11:03.021 --> 11:04.529
ADD AN EXTRA DAY TO THE END OF

11:04.530 --> 11:06.739
THE WEEK, THEN YOU CAN WORK YOUR

11:06.740 --> 11:08.289
PRECIOUS 40 HOURS AND STILL GET

11:08.290 --> 11:10.359
A THREE-DAY WEEKEND.

11:10.360 --> 11:12.459
THERE WOULD STILL BE 365 DAYS IN

11:12.460 --> 11:15.359
THE YEAR, SINCE THE WEEKS ARE

11:15.360 --> 11:17.259
LONGER, WE'D NEED FEWER MONTHS.

11:17.260 --> 11:20.429
WE HAVE TO KEEP OCTOBER AND

11:20.430 --> 11:21.190
DECEMBER, BECAUSE THEY GOT THE

11:21.191 --> 11:22.359
BEST HOLIDAYS.

11:22.360 --> 11:24.949
WE'LL GET RID OF MARCH,

11:24.950 --> 11:26.329
MARCH.

11:26.330 --> 11:27.909
NOBODY LIKES MARCH.

11:27.910 --> 11:29.979
THE ONLY GOOD DAY IN MARCH IS

11:29.980 --> 11:31.289
ST. PATRICK'S DAY.

11:31.290 --> 11:34.329
HERE'S THE BEST BIT, WHEN IT'S

11:34.330 --> 11:36.949
AN 8 DAY WEEK, WE'LL MAKE ONE

11:36.950 --> 11:38.809
DAY EVERY WEEK ST. PATRICK'S

11:38.810 --> 11:41.259
DAY, SO YOU'LL ALWAYS GET IT.

11:41.260 --> 11:42.569
ALSO, I'M DEAD GETTING RID OF

11:42.570 --> 11:44.909
6:00 AN TO 8:00 A.M.

11:44.910 --> 11:47.639
INSTEAD, 12:00 A.M. TO 1:00 A.M.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.569
WILL NOW TAKE THREE HOURS.

11:49.570 --> 11:51.739
YOU'LL ALWAYS LEAVE A PARTY JUST

11:51.740 --> 11:52.460
AFTER MIDNIGHT.

11:52.461 --> 11:54.259
SURE IT WILL  OVER SOME

11:54.260 --> 11:57.639
SHIFT WORKERS, BUT YOU CHOSE TO

11:57.640 --> 11:58.220
BECOME A NURSE.

11:58.220 --> 11:59.020
THERE YOU HAVE IT, JIM'S EIGHT

11:59.021 --> 12:06.669
DAY WEEK.

12:06.670 --> 12:10.289
NOW THAT BEATLES SONG MAKES

12:10.290 --> 12:11.020
SENSE.

12:11.020 --> 12:11.530
YELLOW SUBMARINE.

12:11.531 --> 12:23.839
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.839
>>> WELCOME BACK, WHEN DOES ONE

12:25.840 --> 12:28.329
PERSON'S RIGHT TO PRACTICE THEIR

12:28.330 --> 12:29.569
RELIGION START TO INFRINGE ON

12:29.570 --> 12:31.259
SOMEONE ELSE'S PERSONAL

12:31.260 --> 12:31.670
FREEDOMS.

12:31.671 --> 12:33.289
I MET ONE GROUP OF BELIEVERS WHO

12:33.290 --> 12:35.909
THOUGHT THEY WERE PROTECTED FROM

12:35.910 --> 12:37.219
RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION, BUT NOW

12:37.220 --> 12:38.020
FIND THEMSELVES TOTALLY EXPOSED.

12:38.021 --> 12:39.909
TAKE A LOOK.

12:39.910 --> 12:43.259
>>> A WAR IS BEING WAGED IN THIS

12:43.260 --> 12:44.739
COUNTRY AGAINST AMERICAN

12:44.740 --> 12:45.220
CHRISTIANS.

12:45.221 --> 12:48.119
>> WE ARE STOPPING THE ATTACKS

12:48.120 --> 12:50.429
ON JUDEO-CHRISTIAN VALUES.

12:50.430 --> 12:53.529
>> NOW, JEFF SESSIONS IS

12:53.530 --> 12:54.839
FIGHTING BACK, AND FORMING A

12:54.840 --> 12:55.840
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY TASK FORCE TO

12:55.841 --> 12:56.979
SAVE THE DAY.

12:56.980 --> 13:00.359
>> WE ARE STRONGER AS A NATION

13:00.360 --> 13:02.529
BECAUSE OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF

13:02.530 --> 13:03.190
RELIGIOUS PEOPLE.

13:03.191 --> 13:05.289
>> AND THIS WAR HAS MADE ITS WAY

13:05.290 --> 13:06.220
TO THE LAST PLACE ANYONE WOULD

13:06.221 --> 13:12.189
EXPECT AN ATTACK, HAWAII.

13:12.190 --> 13:13.669
>> I'M BEING PERSECUTED BECAUSE

13:13.670 --> 13:15.739
OF MY RELIGION.

13:15.740 --> 13:17.569
>> AMY IS ENGULFED IN A

13:17.570 --> 13:20.429
RELIGIOUS BATTLE OF HER OWN.

13:20.430 --> 13:23.429
>> YOU WERE EVICTED FROM YOUR

13:23.430 --> 13:24.360
HOME BECAUSE YOU'RE A CHRISTIAN?

13:24.361 --> 13:26.329
>> NOT A CHRISTIAN, A

13:26.330 --> 13:26.740
NATURALIST.

13:26.741 --> 13:28.359
>> A NATURALIST, SO THAT

13:28.360 --> 13:29.739
EXPLAINS WHY YOU'RE NOT WEARING

13:29.740 --> 13:30.290
CLOTHES.

13:30.291 --> 13:31.599
>> THAT EXPLAINS WHY I'M NOT

13:31.600 --> 13:32.190
WEARING CLOTHES.

13:32.191 --> 13:35.879
>> THAT'S RIGHT, HER LANDLORD

13:35.880 --> 13:37.569
GOT HER PANTIES IN A BUNCH

13:37.570 --> 13:41.219
BECAUSE AMY REFUSED TO WEAR

13:41.220 --> 13:41.640
HERS.

13:41.641 --> 13:43.499
AS YOU CAN SEE, SHE COMMITS TO

13:43.500 --> 13:44.290
THE BIT.

13:44.291 --> 13:48.049
>> IT'S MY RELIGION, AND IT'S

13:48.050 --> 13:50.219
ABOUT LIVING THE SKIN I LIVE IN.

13:50.220 --> 13:51.599
>> WHY ARE YOU NAKED RIGHT NOW?

13:51.600 --> 13:52.360
>> BECAUSE IT'S PROVING A POINT

13:52.360 --> 13:53.220
A LITTLE BIT.

13:53.221 --> 13:59.219
>> A COUPLE OF THEM.

13:59.220 --> 14:01.219
>> HAWAII CHRISTIANS HAVEN'T

14:01.220 --> 14:02.809
RUSHED TO AMY'S DEFENSE.

14:02.810 --> 14:05.149
I KEEP ONE HAWAIIAN CHRISTIAN

14:05.150 --> 14:05.880
CONSERVATIVE ON SPEED DIAL.

14:05.881 --> 14:08.399
>> ALOHA.

14:08.400 --> 14:14.079
STATE LEGISLATOR AND

14:14.080 --> 14:15.839
SELF-PROCLAIM ED

14:15.840 --> 14:16.770
SELF-PROCLAIMED

14:16.771 --> 14:17.809
SELF-PROCLAIMED WORKIST --

14:17.810 --> 14:21.149
>> I HEAR YOU INVENTED THE WORD

14:21.150 --> 14:24.809
MANGINA.

14:24.810 --> 14:26.219
>> YES.

14:26.220 --> 14:29.079
>> HOMOSEXUALS WANT THIS TAUGHT

14:29.080 --> 14:31.329
TO KIDS.

14:31.330 --> 14:34.639
ANUS WAS DEFINED AS A GENITAL.

14:34.640 --> 14:35.600
>> HOW CAN YOU BE IN TROUBLE?

14:35.601 --> 14:37.359
>> NO COMMENT.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.189
>> SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE,

14:39.190 --> 14:41.119
THANKS FOR THE COMPLIMENT HONEY,

14:41.120 --> 14:42.429
I MADE YOU SOMETHING NICE.

14:42.430 --> 14:43.499
>> I'M HAVING TROUBLE FOR BEING

14:43.500 --> 14:44.150
HERE TODAY.

14:44.151 --> 14:46.669
>> BUT IT'S NICE TO GET OUT OF

14:46.670 --> 14:47.670
THE HOUSE, ISN'T IT?

14:47.671 --> 14:50.149
>> IS THERE A WAR ON RELIGION IN

14:50.150 --> 14:50.600
AMERICA?

14:50.600 --> 14:51.290
>> ABSOLUTELY.

14:51.291 --> 14:52.739
>> GIVE ME SOME EXAMPLES.

14:52.740 --> 14:55.739
>> PEOPLE OF FAITH ARE BEING

14:55.740 --> 14:58.119
CHASED OUT OF THE PUBLIC SQUARE.

14:58.120 --> 15:00.599
THANKS TO TRUMP PEOPLE ARE

15:00.600 --> 15:03.429
STARTING TO SAY MERRY CHRISTMAS

15:03.430 --> 15:09.049
AGAIN INSTEAD OF THE OBAMA HAPPY

15:09.050 --> 15:09.460
HOLIDAYS.

15:09.461 --> 15:12.329
>> AMY WAS EVICTED FROM HER HOME

15:12.330 --> 15:14.639
FOR PRACTICING HER RELIGION.

15:14.640 --> 15:16.569
>> THE PROBLEM IS, IS SHE USING

15:16.570 --> 15:18.149
THAT ARGUMENT SO SHE CAN

15:18.150 --> 15:20.359
CONTINUE TO DO WHAT THEY DO?

15:20.360 --> 15:22.189
>> DO YOU HAVE CEREMONIES?

15:22.190 --> 15:23.219
>> I HAVE PARTIES.

15:23.220 --> 15:24.329
>> YOU HAVE PARTIES.

15:24.330 --> 15:27.019
>> AND THAT'S WHERE AMY'S

15:27.020 --> 15:27.710
TROUBLES ACTUALLY BEGAN.

15:27.711 --> 15:29.599
SHE CALLED HER RENTAL FREEDOM

15:29.600 --> 15:31.399
HOUSE, SHE ADVERTISED ONLINE,

15:31.400 --> 15:32.290
THERE WAS YOGA.

15:32.291 --> 15:34.429
THERE WAS PROBABLY .

15:34.430 --> 15:36.329
THERE WAS DEFINITELY CARS ON

15:36.330 --> 15:38.359
FIRE, YOU KNOW, STANDARD

15:38.360 --> 15:39.220
RELIGIOUS STUFF.

15:39.221 --> 15:40.529
>> ARE THESE SEX PARTIES?

15:40.530 --> 15:42.189
>> IF A COUPLE WOULD LIKE TO GO

15:42.190 --> 15:44.119
OR -- THEY MAY.

15:44.120 --> 15:46.049
>> SOUNDS LIKE JUST A BIG SEX

15:46.050 --> 15:47.259
PARTY WHERE GUYS ARE GOING IN

15:47.260 --> 15:49.019
THERE JUST TO GET OFF.

15:49.020 --> 15:52.399
>> NAKED YOGA IS NONSEXUAL.

15:52.400 --> 15:54.459
WE DO TOPLESS TACO TUESDAYS.

15:54.460 --> 15:57.569
>> HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO GO

15:57.570 --> 15:58.979
TO TOPLESS TACO TUESDAYS?

15:58.980 --> 16:01.119
>> IT'S FREE.

16:01.120 --> 16:03.019
>> WHERE DO PEOPLE KEEP THEIR

16:03.020 --> 16:04.119
WALLETS.

16:04.120 --> 16:05.289
>> I LOSE MY PHONE SO MUCH.

16:05.290 --> 16:10.289
>> THERE'S ONLY ONE PLACE IT

16:10.290 --> 16:11.020
COULD BE.

16:11.020 --> 16:11.640
>> TOPLESS TACO TUESDAY.

16:11.641 --> 16:14.019
>> WHEN YOU HAVE A PARTY, YOU

16:14.020 --> 16:15.979
TURN MUSIC UP, YOU HAVE A LOT OF

16:15.980 --> 16:20.909
PEOPLE, THE MUSIC GETS LOUD.

16:20.910 --> 16:23.119
>> THE REALITY IS, THEY TURN THE

16:23.120 --> 16:24.529
MUSIC OFF AND ALL YOU HEAR IS

16:24.530 --> 16:25.020
.

16:25.021 --> 16:28.259
>> THAT HAS TO BE PRETTY LOUD.

16:28.260 --> 16:29.669
>> THEY'RE ING EACH

16:29.670 --> 16:31.189
OTHER GOOD.

16:31.190 --> 16:34.019
ADAM AND EVE NAKED, DOESN'T THAT

16:34.020 --> 16:36.329
SHOW GOD BELIEVES IN NUDITY.

16:36.330 --> 16:39.149
NO BELLY BUTTONS, THEY WERE ALL

16:39.150 --> 16:40.979
ATTACHED TO ANOTHER HUMAN.

16:40.980 --> 16:44.879
THAT WAS ALL FILLED IN.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.909
>> NOT SOMETHING I'M FAMILIAR

16:46.910 --> 16:48.289
WITH.

16:48.290 --> 16:49.329
>> ANY RELIGION, REQUIRES FAITH,

16:49.330 --> 16:49.670
FAITH.

16:49.671 --> 16:52.019
>> GEORGE MICHAEL HAD THAT, HE

16:52.020 --> 16:52.500
WAS A BUMMER.

16:52.501 --> 16:54.189
>> I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

16:54.190 --> 16:57.149
>> I WILL TELL YOU THAT THE ONLY

16:57.150 --> 16:58.259
RELIGION THAT YOU'RE ALLOWED TO

16:58.260 --> 17:01.019
MAKE FUN OF IS THE CHRISTIAN

17:01.020 --> 17:02.459
RELIGION, YOU WON'T FIND MANY

17:02.460 --> 17:05.289
COMEDIANS IN HOLLYWOOD MAKING

17:05.290 --> 17:08.459
FUN OF MUSLIMS.

17:08.460 --> 17:11.118
>> WE HAVE A JEWISH HEAD WRITER

17:11.119 --> 17:12.979
ON THE SHOW, BUT HE LETS US.

17:12.980 --> 17:14.148
>> BOB MAKES A GOOD POINT.

17:14.150 --> 17:16.148
YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT

17:16.150 --> 17:18.079
ALL RELIGIONS SHOULD BE TREATED

17:18.079 --> 17:20.019
AS EQUALLY RIDICULOUS.

17:20.020 --> 17:22.219
WHAT MAKES YOUR RELIGION MORE

17:22.220 --> 17:24.878
VALID THAN NATURALISM.

17:24.880 --> 17:27.459
>> I HAVE A DEEPLY HELD

17:27.460 --> 17:29.529
RELIGIOUS BELIEF.

17:29.530 --> 17:29.980
SINCERELY.

17:29.981 --> 17:33.079
>> BUT SHE HAS FREE TACOS.

17:33.080 --> 17:35.359
>> NAKED TACO TUESDAY IS NOT A

17:35.360 --> 17:35.770
RELIGION.

17:35.771 --> 17:37.979
>> I'M NOT SAYING IT IS A

17:37.980 --> 17:39.289
RELIGION, BUT WHY SHOULD

17:39.290 --> 17:40.499
CHRISTIANS GET TO DECIDE.

17:40.500 --> 17:42.739
AND ISN'T JEFF SESSIONS

17:42.740 --> 17:44.909
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY JUST ABOUT

17:44.910 --> 17:46.329
FUNDAMENTALISTS DISCRIMINATING

17:46.330 --> 17:48.359
AGAINST ANYONE WHO'S LOST

17:48.360 --> 17:48.880
VALUES.

17:48.881 --> 17:50.399
>> FOR ANYONE WHO DOUBTS WE'RE

17:50.400 --> 17:53.119
NOT A RELIGION, COME AND SEE OUR

17:53.120 --> 17:54.769
CEREMONIES, COME AND FEEL THE

17:54.770 --> 17:56.949
FEELING OF LOVE FOR YOURSELF.

17:56.950 --> 17:59.909
>> WHAT IF I COULD SHOW YOU

17:59.910 --> 18:00.810
AMY'S CEREMONY, WOULD YOU BE

18:00.810 --> 18:01.330
OPEN TO THAT?

18:01.331 --> 18:03.189
>> YEAH, I DON'T WANT TO GO

18:03.190 --> 18:03.530
THERE.

18:03.531 --> 18:05.329
I WANT TO GO HOME TONIGHT, I

18:05.330 --> 18:07.329
DON'T WANT TO BE IN THE DOGHOUSE

18:07.330 --> 18:07.670
AGAIN.

18:07.671 --> 18:09.399
>> SO WE SEE YOU, JEFF SESSIONS,
