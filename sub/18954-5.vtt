00:27.800 --> 00:30.510
Bringing up children is not simple.

00:30.560 --> 00:32.910
From the moment the midwife cuts the cord,

00:32.960 --> 00:35.830
a mother's task is to nurture and cherish,

00:35.880 --> 00:37.750
to shelter and protect.

00:37.800 --> 00:41.710
Even as she does so, she must
teach the child to leave her,

00:41.760 --> 00:45.910
train it to let go of her
hand, first to walk unaided,

00:45.960 --> 00:47.990
and then to walk away.

00:48.040 --> 00:51.190
But there is a cord
that nothing can sever,

00:51.240 --> 00:53.470
the invisible bond that ties the mother

00:53.520 --> 00:58.430
to her infant, which endures when
the child is a child no more.

00:58.480 --> 01:00.350
That's me, then. You can go now.

01:00.400 --> 01:03.150
Here, Auntie Grace sent you some biscuits

01:03.200 --> 01:05.550
to give to your new friends.

01:05.600 --> 01:07.910
They're broken! I can't give anyone these.

01:07.960 --> 01:09.190
It's embarrassing, Mum.

01:09.240 --> 01:12.440
Don't be daft. They all
go down the same way!

01:29.160 --> 01:32.880
Nurse Dyer. Welcome to Nonnatus House.

01:38.680 --> 01:40.310
Oh!

01:40.360 --> 01:43.790
Mrs Jackson, it's beautiful!

01:43.840 --> 01:46.070
I haven't had a new frock in so long.

01:46.120 --> 01:48.550
Nurse Franklin did say cocktail
dresses were your forte.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.630
She's one of my best customers.

01:50.680 --> 01:53.110
She keeps the wolf from
the door, all right.

01:53.160 --> 01:55.350
Now, where d'you want it?

01:55.400 --> 02:00.470
- Um... - 'Bout there?
That's a good length on you.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.470
Oh!

02:02.520 --> 02:04.390
Are you all right?

02:05.720 --> 02:08.630
Just a bit breathless. It's age.

02:08.680 --> 02:10.479
Comes to us all.

02:11.880 --> 02:14.550
That's Reggie, but don't mind him.

02:22.280 --> 02:24.150
If you've no objection, Nurse Dyer,

02:24.200 --> 02:27.030
we'll put you to work as
soon as you've unpacked.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.870
None at all. I'm here to work,

02:28.920 --> 02:31.270
and the harder the better.

02:31.320 --> 02:34.120
I hope you'll find it to your liking.

02:34.960 --> 02:36.270
This is your bed.

02:36.320 --> 02:41.590
I don't want to be rude, Sister, but
I was hoping for a room to myself.

02:41.640 --> 02:43.670
Most of the midwives have to share.

02:43.720 --> 02:47.150
The thing is, and I'm a bit
embarrassed to admit it,

02:47.200 --> 02:51.070
but I snore. Like an elephant.

02:51.120 --> 02:55.590
Well, I'm sure we can supply Nurse
Franklin with plenty of earplugs.

02:55.640 --> 02:58.070
The others are just finishing breakfast.

02:58.120 --> 03:00.710
When you're ready, go
down to the clinical room

03:00.760 --> 03:03.590
and Nurse Crane will assign
you your duties for today.

03:03.640 --> 03:06.310
I'll be down in two ticks, Sister.

03:31.080 --> 03:33.760
Oh, how lovely! Thank you, darling.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.670
I was thinking I might get up today.

03:36.720 --> 03:38.190
What does the doctor think?

03:38.240 --> 03:41.830
In the doctor's expert opinion,
it's still a bit too soon.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.670
I had a feeling the doctor might say that.

03:43.720 --> 03:46.310
- Has anyone seen my cricket bat?
- Under the pile in the hall?

03:46.360 --> 03:48.510
Which pile? There's
quite a few to pick from.

03:48.560 --> 03:49.790
I'll get it for you.

03:49.840 --> 03:52.640
Stay right where you are, Mrs Turner.

03:57.600 --> 04:00.230
I'll have it ready for Sunday.
I'll bring it to church.

04:00.280 --> 04:02.350
Oh, that would be lovely.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.350
Oh, goodness, I'm late!

04:04.400 --> 04:06.030
I'll see you Sunday.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.830
Hello, Fred.

04:07.880 --> 04:11.190
- It's like Piccadilly Circus round here.
- Morning, Ivy.

04:11.240 --> 04:12.550
I got your message.

04:12.600 --> 04:13.990
Vi said you were leaking again.

04:14.040 --> 04:18.399
It's my tap, cheeky
beggar. Best come inside.

04:20.079 --> 04:23.830
It's all right, Reggie, Cousin
Fred's come to fix the tap.

04:23.880 --> 04:25.110
Reggie!

04:25.160 --> 04:26.390
Hello, Fred.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.710
Still got that strong hand grip, I see!

04:28.760 --> 04:32.070
You better let go of him or he
won't be able to fix the tap.

04:32.120 --> 04:34.150
What are we having for dinner?

04:34.200 --> 04:36.030
What do you fancy?

04:36.080 --> 04:37.350
Rice pudding.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.870
Then that's what we're having.

04:44.320 --> 04:47.790
Nurse Dyer, welcome. Are
you early or are we late?

04:47.840 --> 04:49.790
I'm early. Blame the army.

04:49.840 --> 04:54.190
No blame necessary. Punctuality
is a very desirable trait.

04:54.240 --> 04:56.430
One we could all do with cultivating.

04:56.480 --> 04:57.710
Sorry.

04:57.760 --> 05:01.630
Ladies, may I introduce Nurse
Valerie Dyer, our latest recruit.

05:01.680 --> 05:03.590
- Welcome!
- Hello.

05:03.640 --> 05:06.790
Shall we do our level best to
convince her that we operate

05:06.840 --> 05:08.310
like a well-oiled machine?

05:08.360 --> 05:10.910
We've heard a lot about you.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.110
You'll need this. It's
got everything you need

05:13.160 --> 05:15.710
for day-to-day work and
anything else is in here.

05:15.760 --> 05:17.510
Make sure you sign all items out.

05:17.560 --> 05:19.430
Nurse Crane likes to run a tight ship,

05:19.480 --> 05:20.830
down to the very last clamp.

05:20.880 --> 05:24.350
Thanks. I didn't realise how
much I'd missed all this.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.950
Right, ladies, to work.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.590
Nurse Gilbert, post-natal check
on Mrs Hunt in Baxter Buildings

05:30.640 --> 05:32.350
then back here on call.

05:32.400 --> 05:36.400
Sister Winifred, maternity
home to cover for Mrs Turner.

05:36.520 --> 05:38.790
I'm so happy to be able to
help our own mother-to-be.

05:38.840 --> 05:43.350
I've put you on routine home visits,
Nurse Dyer. Nothing too taxing.

05:43.400 --> 05:47.390
Around Grundy Street and Stainsby Road.

05:47.440 --> 05:50.310
That was Mr Williams. His
wife's in a great deal of pain.

05:50.360 --> 05:52.910
It sounds as though
she's gone into labour.

05:52.960 --> 05:57.070
Oh! She's not due for another two weeks.

05:57.120 --> 05:59.270
Can you go, Nurse Franklin?

05:59.320 --> 06:02.470
I'll spare Nurse Dyer.
It is her first day.

06:02.520 --> 06:05.840
Just my luck. The most
miserable woman in Poplar.

06:13.280 --> 06:16.400
Oh Bill, do it. Just do it!

06:20.280 --> 06:21.950
I can't, Crystal. I can't do it.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.230
Ah, you have to!

06:23.280 --> 06:27.030
I'll go stark raving mad if
I have to put up with this.

06:27.080 --> 06:28.230
I don't care who it is,

06:28.280 --> 06:31.780
get them in here and give
them the bloody pliers!

06:32.280 --> 06:34.190
Hello, Mrs Williams. Midwife calling.

06:34.240 --> 06:38.470
Oh, sweetie. Can you tell me how
far apart the contractions are?

06:38.520 --> 06:39.710
It's not the baby!

06:39.760 --> 06:40.950
It's her teeth, Nurse.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.990
Oh, Bill, you haven't...?

06:43.040 --> 06:45.990
No, she asked me to, but I
couldn't do it. I just couldn't.

06:46.040 --> 06:48.710
You do it, Nurse. Please, I'm begging you.

06:48.760 --> 06:51.030
I'm afraid I can't, Mrs Williams.

06:51.080 --> 06:54.110
I'm not qualified to pull
teeth out with pliers.

06:54.160 --> 06:56.710
Toothache is absolutely vile, I know.

06:56.760 --> 06:58.990
Why don't you let me take a little look?

06:59.040 --> 07:02.320
If you don't let me, I
won't be able to help.

07:08.920 --> 07:12.310
Oh, gosh, poor you.
That does look terrible.

07:12.360 --> 07:15.830
No wonder you're in agony. I think
you might have an infection.

07:15.880 --> 07:18.620
We'll have to get you to the doctor.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.630
You have an abscess, Mrs Williams.

07:23.680 --> 07:26.390
A serious infection beneath your tooth.

07:26.440 --> 07:32.430
I will prescribe you painkillers
and a course of penicillin.

07:32.480 --> 07:35.470
I want this cleared up before
baby makes an appearance.

07:35.520 --> 07:39.470
I'll also refer you to the
dental department at the hospital.

07:39.520 --> 07:42.710
Hopefully, the dentist
can see you immediately.

07:42.760 --> 07:46.230
Dentist? Why do I need to see a dentist?

07:46.280 --> 07:47.950
You've given me medicine.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.750
Your teeth are badly
decayed, Mrs Williams.

07:50.800 --> 07:53.790
That could be quite dangerous
in a pregnant woman.

07:53.840 --> 07:56.510
No. Please, no! No dentist!

07:56.560 --> 07:57.550
They're butchers.

07:57.600 --> 08:00.110
There, there, Mrs Williams,
try not to get upset.

08:00.160 --> 08:01.190
I'm not going.

08:01.240 --> 08:02.350
Mrs Williams,

08:02.400 --> 08:05.670
a fear of the dentist is one of
the most common phobias there is.

08:05.720 --> 08:10.560
Next to spiders. We understand.
There is nothing to be ashamed of.

08:13.400 --> 08:14.870
Thank you.

08:14.920 --> 08:17.070
Oh, hello.

08:17.120 --> 08:20.220
We just popped in to
see how your day went.

08:20.760 --> 08:24.430
I loved it! I can't wait for tomorrow.

08:24.480 --> 08:27.070
Don't be too keen -- you'll
put the rest of us to shame.

08:27.120 --> 08:30.520
Thank you for re-arranging
my wardrobe, Valerie.

08:31.320 --> 08:36.000
Well, I did need somewhere
to hang both my dresses.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.190
I'm teasing. You've done me a favour.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.990
I've got far too many clothes, anyway.

08:43.039 --> 08:45.430
In fact, I'm going to
do a gigantic clear-out

08:45.480 --> 08:47.870
and give bags of stuff
to the church jumble.

08:47.920 --> 08:50.190
Then she'll just go and
buy it all back again.

08:50.240 --> 08:51.390
Twiglet?

08:51.440 --> 08:54.030
- Oh, I've got nuts, if you fancy those.
- How about a drink?

08:54.080 --> 08:57.110
Oh, I didn't know this was...
So I haven't brought anything.

08:57.160 --> 08:58.750
Don't be silly. It doesn't matter.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.550
You can bring the snacks next time.

09:00.600 --> 09:04.110
Well, I have got biscuits. But, er...

09:04.160 --> 09:05.950
you wouldn't want them. They're broken.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.100
My Auntie Grace gave me them.
You don't have to eat them.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.630
Don't be daft, they're delicious.

09:12.680 --> 09:14.800
They are.

09:22.120 --> 09:24.790
I won't be back from church
until the big hand's at the six

09:24.840 --> 09:26.550
and the little hand's at the 12.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.140
Understand?

09:28.640 --> 09:31.180
Reggie, are you listening to me?

09:32.000 --> 09:34.200
Point at the clock, then.

09:42.440 --> 09:45.430
Now, what do I tell ya?
Don't touch the stove.

09:45.480 --> 09:48.150
Don't open the window.
Don't answer the door.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.870
- And...
- Don't eat the biscuits.

09:51.640 --> 09:53.110
Good lad.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.360
Ah!

09:58.320 --> 09:59.790
Indigestion.

09:59.840 --> 10:03.080
I knew I shouldn't have eaten
the last of that rice pudding.

10:04.320 --> 10:05.710
I'm going now.

10:05.760 --> 10:07.230
Roger and out.

10:07.280 --> 10:08.990
I love you, Reggie.

10:09.040 --> 10:10.840
I love you, Mum.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.830
"Jesus said..."

10:16.880 --> 10:21.280
"suffer the little children,
and let them come unto me."

10:22.600 --> 10:24.710
And in saying children,

10:24.760 --> 10:27.350
perhaps Jesus wanted us to know
that he values those who are

10:27.400 --> 10:32.200
no longer children but who still
see the world with a child's eye.

10:33.400 --> 10:38.960
Those of us still filled with
curiosity. Those open to new ideas.

10:40.160 --> 10:43.280
Those who are trusting and free of fear.

10:44.720 --> 10:48.870
"For of such is the
kingdom of heaven." Amen.

10:48.920 --> 10:50.430
Amen.

10:50.480 --> 10:53.430
Now, let us sing hymn number 205.

10:53.480 --> 10:56.080
Love Divine, All Loves Excelling.

11:10.800 --> 11:14.190
♪ Love divine... ♪

11:19.320 --> 11:21.200
Tom, help me!

12:22.080 --> 12:26.080
It's only me, Reggie, cousin
Fred. Can you open the door?

12:27.400 --> 12:30.710
I'm not allowed. Mum will not let me.

12:30.760 --> 12:33.630
I'm sure she won't mind. Come on, son.

12:40.920 --> 12:42.590
Reggie...

12:42.640 --> 12:45.920
your mum was taken ill at the church.

12:47.040 --> 12:51.040
Reggie, your mum was so ill that
even a doctor couldn't help her.

12:52.120 --> 12:53.760
And she died.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.110
Do you understand what that means?

12:58.160 --> 13:01.440
That she's gone to sleep
and can't wake up?

13:05.760 --> 13:07.630
That's right, son.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.320
Is she with God now?

13:14.120 --> 13:16.110
She is, Reggie.

13:16.160 --> 13:17.790
That's nice.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.960
Can I have my dinner?

13:23.840 --> 13:27.430
Er, yeah, Violet's got it all ready.

13:27.480 --> 13:29.390
Who's Violet?

13:29.440 --> 13:34.150
She's my wife, Reggie. Let's get
you a bag and get you packed.

13:34.200 --> 13:41.080
Where will the little hand be when
my mum comes back from seeing God?

14:22.480 --> 14:26.230
Reggie, this is Violet, my wife.

14:26.280 --> 14:28.550
- Hello, Violet.
- Hello, Reggie.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.790
He's got a firm grip, hasn't he?

14:30.840 --> 14:33.920
He certainly has! That's a
lovely plant you've got!

14:35.200 --> 14:36.710
It's Ivy's.

14:36.760 --> 14:39.550
Reggie's going to be staying
with us for a couple of days,

14:39.600 --> 14:41.870
just till he gets himself sorted.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.790
Hm. Lovely.

14:43.840 --> 14:47.030
Erm, Reggie, why don't you take
your plant through to the spare room

14:47.080 --> 14:48.710
and find a nice bright spot for it?

14:48.760 --> 14:51.830
And then we can eat. You
must be starving, eh?

14:51.880 --> 14:54.480
It's all right, go on, on you go.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.870
I don't think it's sunk in yet.

14:59.640 --> 15:03.670
Fred, I know he's lost his
mum and that's terrible,

15:03.720 --> 15:06.070
but why have you brought him here?

15:06.120 --> 15:08.310
I couldn't leave him, Vi,
he was all on his own.

15:08.360 --> 15:10.830
He had nowhere else to
go. It won't be for long.

15:10.880 --> 15:14.070
Yes, but we don't know anything
about, you know... people like that.

15:14.120 --> 15:17.590
I mean, I'm not being cruel,
Fred, but he's simple, you know,

15:17.640 --> 15:19.350
he needs proper care.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.510
What are we going to do
with him when we're at work?

15:21.560 --> 15:23.470
He'll be fine up here.

15:23.520 --> 15:26.070
Never got in Ivy's way when
she was doing her fittings.

15:26.120 --> 15:27.110
Oh, I've got to go to

15:27.160 --> 15:29.390
Letchworth tomorrow morning
for a couple of hours.

15:29.440 --> 15:31.950
There's an exhibition at the
Spirella corsetry factory.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.510
It's quite the event.

15:33.560 --> 15:35.270
I've got a new hat.

15:35.320 --> 15:38.790
Yeah, well, look, he'll be all
right here until you get back.

15:38.840 --> 15:43.270
Ivy used to leave him all the
time when she went to church,

15:43.320 --> 15:47.520
- and I'll do my best to
pop in, all right? - Hm.

15:58.920 --> 16:01.460
Valerie Dyer from Grundy Street.

16:02.760 --> 16:06.560
June Dyer's middle daughter,
born in the middle of a blizzard?

16:07.720 --> 16:09.720
How do you know that?

16:11.240 --> 16:15.310
Because I was the midwife
who attended your mother.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.880
Myself and Sister Evangelina.

16:20.120 --> 16:21.920
I cut your cord.

17:06.040 --> 17:09.190
Nurse Crane, that was Dr Turner.

17:09.240 --> 17:13.069
He's setting up an exciting
new dental health project and

17:13.119 --> 17:15.790
he wants me to help him with it.

17:15.839 --> 17:19.589
May I be excused from
district duty this morning?

17:19.640 --> 17:21.589
I have to prepare my materials.

17:21.640 --> 17:24.310
He could not have asked for
a more qualified nurse.

17:24.359 --> 17:26.430
You have our blessing.

17:26.720 --> 17:31.910
Thank you, Sister. Together we're
going to save the Borough's teeth.

17:31.960 --> 17:34.430
I can just see the posters now.

17:37.080 --> 17:40.710
♪ I'm a pink toothbrush.
You're a blue toothbrush... ♪

17:40.760 --> 17:42.630

17:42.680 --> 17:45.790
Oh, I know but I feel
so much better, Patrick.

17:45.840 --> 17:48.870
In fact, I feel healthier
than I've felt in years.

17:48.920 --> 17:51.950
I've got so much energy.
I just want to do things.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.470
Has anyone seen my swimming trunks?

17:53.520 --> 17:56.430
What's going on? Why
can't you find anything?

17:56.480 --> 17:58.950
- Because our room's a mess.
- Then tidy it.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.120
I do. Then it gets untidy
again. It's a mystery.

18:03.360 --> 18:07.270
We need more space, Patrick.
Timothy needs his own room.

18:07.320 --> 18:10.150
He's growing up. He can't
share with Angela any longer.

18:10.200 --> 18:12.430
We just need to be more disciplined.

18:12.480 --> 18:16.240
Besides, she's going to be sharing
with her new brother or sister.

18:17.560 --> 18:21.550
Look, why don't we talk
about the flats another time?

18:21.600 --> 18:23.470
First things first.

18:23.520 --> 18:26.990
Come back to work and
see how you feel then.

18:27.040 --> 18:29.070
Is that the doctor's expert opinion?

18:29.120 --> 18:30.660
Yes. It is.

18:35.560 --> 18:38.070
Stop it. Stop it!

18:38.120 --> 18:39.630
Stop it!

18:39.680 --> 18:42.030
Oi, oi, oi, what's all this noise, eh?

18:42.080 --> 18:46.830
Look, your mum's a little bit
tired this morning, that's all.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.550
I'm not tired!

18:48.600 --> 18:50.430
I'm terrified.

18:50.480 --> 18:52.590
You have to be brave, Crystal.

18:52.640 --> 18:54.350
Easy for you to say.

18:54.400 --> 18:58.200
You're not the one about to
be butchered by a dentist.

19:01.480 --> 19:05.880
- Don't look at me. - Why
not? - Because I'm ugly.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.750
Not to me, you're not.

19:11.640 --> 19:14.350
You need your eyes testing.

19:14.400 --> 19:17.430
Don't forget to go to the baby clinic.

19:17.480 --> 19:19.270
Another slice of toast, Reggie?

19:19.320 --> 19:21.750
You haven't got time,
Fred. We've got to go!

19:21.800 --> 19:26.030
Right, have whatever you
want. The bread's over there.

19:26.080 --> 19:28.550
How long will you be? Point on the clock.

19:28.600 --> 19:31.790
He wants you to show him on the
clock when you're going to be back.

19:31.840 --> 19:34.880
Ivy used to do that for
you, didn't she, Reggie?

19:36.800 --> 19:40.110
Right, well, that's us. Bye, Reggie.

19:40.160 --> 19:43.160
- Bye, Fred. Bye, Violet.
- Bye, Reggie.

19:46.440 --> 19:49.110
Remind me how old Reggie is again?

19:49.160 --> 19:51.430
21. Just turned.

19:51.480 --> 19:53.630
That makes it more difficult.

19:53.680 --> 19:57.430
St Gideon's is shut down now and
he's too old for Dr Barnardo's.

19:57.480 --> 20:01.750
As far as I know, the only other
place would be an institution.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.270
Somewhere like Linchmere Hospital.

20:03.320 --> 20:06.030
Linchmere? That's a loony bin.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.710
He's not barmy, he's
just a bit... you know.

20:08.760 --> 20:11.150
There don't seem to be many
other choices, I'm afraid.

20:11.200 --> 20:14.350
Well he can stay with us,
till after the funeral.

20:14.400 --> 20:17.430
Vi's agreed to that but she
won't want it to be any longer.

20:17.480 --> 20:19.070
She's finding it a bit difficult.

20:19.120 --> 20:22.320
I can understand. They're
not used to each other.

20:24.080 --> 20:26.430
Ivy was very protective of him, you see.

20:26.480 --> 20:30.880
She loved him. But that
makes it harder for him now.

20:32.360 --> 20:34.590
Why don't you leave it with me?

20:34.640 --> 20:38.240
I'll see if there's anywhere
other than Linchmere.

Can you see what I had for lunch?

21:49.920 --> 21:53.150
Any bits of ham sandwich?
Or cheese and onion crisps?

21:53.200 --> 21:55.430
- No!
- And do you know why?

Sister Winifred, this class

I think we've been enjoying

22:31.360 --> 22:32.870
Opinions may differ on that.

22:32.920 --> 22:36.230
I've undergone a whole
series of dental examinations!

22:36.280 --> 22:37.870
That's lovely.

22:37.920 --> 22:40.870
But while you've been playing games,
some of us have been trying to work.

22:40.920 --> 22:44.430
This is Mr Dockerill, Nurse
Franklin. The dentist.

22:44.480 --> 22:46.430
I'm sorry about the noise, Nurse.

22:46.480 --> 22:47.910
But in Health Education,

22:47.960 --> 22:50.270
we find children do better
when they have some fun.

22:50.320 --> 22:53.350
And in midwifery, we find that
mothers and babies do better

22:53.400 --> 22:56.140
when they have some peace and quiet.

22:59.720 --> 23:04.910
Well, baby seems very happy in
there. Now, let's sit you up.

23:04.960 --> 23:08.670
How did you get on at the dental
department at St Cuthbert's today?

23:08.720 --> 23:11.460
Not as bad as you thought, I'm sure.

23:12.640 --> 23:14.780
You didn't go, did you?

23:16.200 --> 23:19.430
Oh, Crystal, you heard
what Dr Turner said.

23:19.480 --> 23:21.590
Antibiotics aren't going to be enough.

23:21.640 --> 23:24.940
I don't want people
poking around in my mouth!

23:26.240 --> 23:27.630
I'm scared.

23:27.680 --> 23:29.790
I know, Crystal.

23:29.840 --> 23:32.150
But if you don't get your teeth seen to,

23:32.200 --> 23:34.870
the pain will send your
blood pressure sky-rocketing.

23:34.920 --> 23:37.660
And that's not good for baby, is it?

23:39.200 --> 23:41.550
Crystal, sweetie.

23:41.600 --> 23:45.000
Would you wait here for
me? Just for two ticks?

23:51.400 --> 23:53.910
Mr Dockerill? May I speak
to you for a moment?

23:53.960 --> 23:55.910
We are going, Nurse, I promise.

23:55.960 --> 23:58.910
Just as soon as I've rescued Sister
Winifred's rather ingenious props.

23:58.960 --> 24:03.110
I have a mother with an
extremely severe gum infection.

24:03.160 --> 24:05.470
She had an emergency appointment
at the hospital today,

24:05.520 --> 24:07.670
- but didn't keep it.
- Nervous patient?

24:07.720 --> 24:10.920
Terribly. Obviously
nobody likes dentists...

24:12.520 --> 24:13.870
.. but she's terrified.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.790
It is so very, very common.

24:15.840 --> 24:17.910
And she's eight months pregnant.

24:17.960 --> 24:20.030
I see. Where is she?

24:20.080 --> 24:22.750
Follow me. Mrs Williams is in here.

24:24.600 --> 24:27.150
Crystal, this is Mr Dockerill.

24:27.200 --> 24:30.350
- He just wants to have a little look
in your mouth. - Is he a dentist?

24:30.400 --> 24:32.910
I am a dentist, but I
promise I won't hurt you.

24:32.960 --> 24:35.710
All I'm going to do is look
inside your mouth and see what's

24:35.760 --> 24:37.830
causing all this pain.

24:38.920 --> 24:41.870
I'm sure Nurse Franklin can hold
your hand, if you would like.

24:41.920 --> 24:43.920
Of course I can.

24:44.920 --> 24:46.310
Thank you.

24:46.360 --> 24:50.160
Now, can you open your mouth
as wide as you can bear?

24:52.040 --> 24:53.780
That's perfect.

24:56.560 --> 24:58.910
Very good. All done. You
can close your mouth now.

24:58.960 --> 25:01.230
- Well done, sweetie.
- Mrs Williams, it's very important

25:01.280 --> 25:03.470
you come to the hospital
as soon as you can.

25:03.520 --> 25:05.350
Why? What you going to do to me?

25:05.400 --> 25:08.230
Just look inside your mouth
again, using my instruments,

25:08.280 --> 25:10.220
and in better light.

25:11.960 --> 25:15.030
Nurse Franklin can come along
and hold your hand again,

25:15.080 --> 25:16.950
if you would like.

25:17.680 --> 25:21.680
- Would you?
- If it helps you and helps baby. Yes.

25:23.120 --> 25:25.390
- All right, then.
- That's the spirit.

25:25.440 --> 25:28.390
Now, if you'll excuse me, I
must get back to Sister Winifred.

25:28.440 --> 25:31.600
She'll be thinking Nurse
Franklin's run me out of town.

25:35.280 --> 25:36.670
He's quite nice.

25:36.720 --> 25:39.120

26:59.520 --> 27:02.120
It's all right. You're safe now.

27:14.640 --> 27:16.550
I told you this was going to happen.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.750
I mean he could've... Anything could've...

27:18.800 --> 27:20.350
Something really terrible...

27:20.400 --> 27:22.550
I know, I know. But it didn't.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.470
Yeah, because we were lucky. This time.

27:26.760 --> 27:30.750
I had no idea he was so
sheltered with Ivy. No idea.

27:30.800 --> 27:34.590
Yes, but he was. And he can't take
care of himself, that's for sure.

27:34.640 --> 27:38.360
So, what are we going to
do with him, Fred Buckle?

27:40.960 --> 27:42.990
I don't know.

27:43.040 --> 27:48.560
I just know that we are all he's got.

28:05.240 --> 28:08.870
It's all right. Just keep
breathing into the bag, Crystal.

28:08.920 --> 28:11.750
It will calm you.

28:11.800 --> 28:13.830
Slowly.

28:13.880 --> 28:16.390
Don't forget I'll be in there with you.

28:16.440 --> 28:18.310
I won't leave you.

28:20.760 --> 28:24.590
These are flowers. You leave them
be. They're meant to be here.

28:24.640 --> 28:28.470
And these are weeds. You pull them out.

28:28.520 --> 28:32.310
Now they won't want to come out so
give them a yank or use the trowel.

28:32.360 --> 28:34.270
Fred...

28:34.320 --> 28:35.710
Did your lady wife remember

28:35.760 --> 28:37.350
to furnish you with some of her

28:37.400 --> 28:40.030
highly prized and most delicious jam?

28:40.080 --> 28:42.190
Run out again, have they, Sister?

28:42.240 --> 28:44.640
It's a puzzle that eludes me.

28:46.200 --> 28:49.200
Ooh. They will be most pleased.

28:50.720 --> 28:54.150
Young man, may I enquire
what you are doing?

28:54.200 --> 28:55.670
Pulling weeds.

28:55.720 --> 28:58.790
That is not a weed.
That is common fleabane.

28:58.840 --> 29:02.830
It grows freely and thus it flourishes.

29:02.880 --> 29:05.230
We do nature a grave disservice

29:05.280 --> 29:08.880
if we apply restraint
when there should be none.

29:11.400 --> 29:14.070
Leave that one where it is for now.

29:17.240 --> 29:19.470
.. five, six.

29:19.520 --> 29:24.240
And lower right one, two, three,
four, five, six and seven.

29:25.920 --> 29:27.950
You're doing so well, Crystal.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.470
You are indeed.

29:29.520 --> 29:31.260
And we're done.

29:34.280 --> 29:36.950
Mrs Williams, Dr Turner
was absolutely right.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.430
You do have abscesses.

29:38.480 --> 29:40.270
That's why you're in such pain.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.550
I'm afraid your teeth are
going to have to come out.

29:42.600 --> 29:44.230
How many?

29:44.280 --> 29:47.630
Given the extent of your gum
disease, I think all of them.

29:47.680 --> 29:49.590
All of them?

29:49.640 --> 29:52.590
And, bearing in mind how
poorly you've been feeling,

29:52.640 --> 29:54.030
the sooner the better.

29:54.080 --> 29:56.750
I'm going to put you to sleep
and while you're dreaming of

29:56.800 --> 29:59.430
lovely things, I will
deal with everything.

29:59.480 --> 30:01.990
And when you wake up, all
the pain will be gone.

30:02.040 --> 30:05.190
But I won't have any teeth. And
I'll look worse than I do now.

30:05.240 --> 30:07.710
No, no. You will have teeth.

30:07.760 --> 30:11.070
Not tomorrow, or the next day, but soon.

30:11.120 --> 30:14.350
I'm going to make sure you get
dentures that look as good as --

30:14.400 --> 30:17.390
or indeed better -- than the real thing.

30:17.440 --> 30:20.760
- You'll look quite the film
star when you smile. - Will I?

30:22.160 --> 30:24.500
Without a shadow of a doubt.

30:26.670 --> 30:27.670
Hello!

30:27.720 --> 30:29.520
Hello, Jennifer.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.150
Don't pull the flowers.

30:44.200 --> 30:47.600
I am returning them to whence they came.

30:48.760 --> 30:51.840
- Are they dead?
- They are past their glory.

30:52.840 --> 30:54.630
They have given us joy

30:54.680 --> 30:57.710
and delighted us with their beauty.

30:57.760 --> 31:00.350
But now their time has gone.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.310
There is still much work to be done.

31:02.360 --> 31:05.590
Will the flowers have a funeral?

31:05.640 --> 31:09.000
They go back to the earth. As we all do.

31:12.400 --> 31:15.870
I got them from the
shed. They're a present.

31:15.920 --> 31:17.460
For my mum.

31:21.360 --> 31:23.360
Put them in this bag.

31:25.320 --> 31:27.270
Reggie.

31:27.320 --> 31:29.910
Time to go. Come on.

31:29.960 --> 31:31.630
Come on, mate.

31:37.040 --> 31:40.740
Oh, you've had a lovely day
with Sister Monica Joan.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.870
She appreciates the help, you know.

31:45.240 --> 31:48.510
Reggie's going to grow some plants,
to keep Ivy's plant company.

31:48.560 --> 31:50.030
I see.

31:50.080 --> 31:53.550
There won't be much room
in there for too many, mind.

31:53.600 --> 31:56.140
Yeah, he knows. Just one or two.

31:57.600 --> 32:01.870
Ah. Has there been any
news? From Mrs Turner?

32:01.920 --> 32:03.510
No, not yet.

32:03.560 --> 32:05.630
What's that you've got?

32:05.680 --> 32:07.950
Oh, I got him a suit for the funeral.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.160
But he'll need some braces.
Or the trousers turning up.

32:12.160 --> 32:14.100
Give it here, then.

32:18.360 --> 32:20.190
Stand still. Come on, brush them.

32:20.240 --> 32:22.070
Do you want your teeth to fall out?

32:22.120 --> 32:26.110
Now, see what I'm doing. Now you do it.

32:26.160 --> 32:29.860
- Bit late for that, in't it?
- Will you just do it?

32:31.840 --> 32:33.430
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

32:33.480 --> 32:36.320
- Shh.
- You all right?

32:42.520 --> 32:43.830
Violet.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.350
Yes, Reggie.

32:45.400 --> 32:48.510
- I liked it today.
- Oh, good.

32:48.560 --> 32:50.390
That's good.

32:50.440 --> 32:53.320
I really want to go there every day.

32:54.520 --> 32:57.390
Well, let's see how it goes. Shall we?

32:58.200 --> 33:01.230
Oh, Reggie. What's wrong?

33:01.280 --> 33:04.710
Are you sad? It's all right to be sad.

33:04.760 --> 33:06.550
It's normal.

33:06.600 --> 33:09.080
No. I'm happy.

33:10.720 --> 33:14.080
Well, that's a good thing,
isn't it? To be happy.

33:15.200 --> 33:18.720
Not if my mum's angry.

33:20.120 --> 33:22.070
Why would she be angry?

33:22.120 --> 33:24.260
Because she's not here.

33:25.640 --> 33:31.080
Oh, Reggie, your mum would be delighted.

33:32.280 --> 33:35.480
All she ever wanted was
for you to be happy.

33:37.600 --> 33:41.200
And Fred and I are going
to make sure that you are.

33:41.480 --> 33:48.520
Now, stand still and no... fidgeting. Hmm.

33:55.480 --> 33:58.590
I don't think you'll get all this
on your bike, Sister Winifred.

33:58.640 --> 34:00.870
Do you want me to get
my Uncle Pete's barrow?

34:00.920 --> 34:03.590
Would you like a lift,
Sister? I'm going your way.

34:03.640 --> 34:07.360
Oh, that would be wonderful. Thank you.

34:15.679 --> 34:20.350
Sister Winifred, you're
staring. It's making me nervous.

34:20.400 --> 34:23.670
Have you never seen
anyone change gear before?

34:23.719 --> 34:25.630
I beg your pardon, Nurse Crane.

34:25.679 --> 34:28.880
I'm just fascinated by how it all works.

34:33.040 --> 34:34.949
Earth to earth,

34:35.000 --> 34:36.710
ashes to ashes,

34:36.760 --> 34:38.590
dust to dust,

34:38.639 --> 34:42.750
in sure and certain hope of the
resurrection to eternal life

34:42.800 --> 34:45.230
through our Lord Jesus Christ,

34:45.280 --> 34:49.710
who shall change the body of our
lower state that it may be like unto

34:49.760 --> 34:51.030
his glorious body,

34:51.080 --> 34:53.590
according to the mighty working,

34:53.639 --> 34:57.800
whereby he is able to subdue
all things to himself.

35:01.640 --> 35:03.310
Are you ready?

35:35.640 --> 35:38.310
They won't grow if you watch them.

35:39.560 --> 35:42.710
Do you want to give me your jacket?

35:42.760 --> 35:45.520
And you can take your tie off.

35:46.720 --> 35:50.200
And I'll go and see if we've got
some of that nice rice pudding.

35:59.760 --> 36:02.360
It's from the Linchmere Hospital.

36:03.760 --> 36:07.510
They say they can take him, if we want.

36:07.560 --> 36:09.950
The Linchmere?

36:10.000 --> 36:12.710
My Aunt Nellie went in
there when she went funny.

36:12.760 --> 36:14.230
In the head.

36:14.280 --> 36:16.950
They want us to go and have a look.

36:17.880 --> 36:20.790
Well, you're not taking
Reggie. It might upset him.

36:20.840 --> 36:24.600
No, I'll go. There's no harm in looking.

36:30.680 --> 36:35.590
Fred, you do know that this
day's sadness will pass.

36:35.640 --> 36:39.150
No doubt, Sister. He said his goodbyes.

36:39.200 --> 36:42.300
- He's a brave lad.
- Yet you are troubled?

36:44.000 --> 36:45.910
He can't stay with me and Vi,

36:45.960 --> 36:49.600
and a place has come up
at the Linchmere hospital.

36:51.080 --> 36:54.240
Is not a hospital for sick people?

36:55.440 --> 36:57.910
That's what I thought, Sister.

36:58.520 --> 37:00.110
I'm off to see it later.

37:00.160 --> 37:02.360
I'm keeping an open mind.

37:05.080 --> 37:07.510
Now, when you're ready, I want
you to start counting backwards

37:07.560 --> 37:10.510
- from ten.
- What, now? Now?

37:10.560 --> 37:13.630
Count with me, Crystal. Ten.

37:13.680 --> 37:16.310
- Ten. - Nine. - Nine.

37:16.360 --> 37:18.030
- Eight.
- Eight.

37:18.080 --> 37:20.430
- Seven.
- Seven.

37:20.480 --> 37:24.320
Six, five...

37:25.800 --> 37:27.140
Thanks.

You've done so well, Crystal!

38:34.920 --> 38:36.750
Have they gone?

38:36.800 --> 38:38.390
Every last one of them.

38:38.440 --> 38:41.440
And you'll soon be feeling so much better.

38:42.680 --> 38:45.590
Don't worry, it's a fairly
common reaction to the gas.

38:45.640 --> 38:49.150
Bite down hard on this
pad for me, Mrs Williams.

38:49.200 --> 38:51.590
There is always some
bleeding to begin with,

38:51.640 --> 38:53.980
but it shouldn't last long.

39:08.440 --> 39:10.190
Sister!

39:10.240 --> 39:14.070
I find two opinions are
always better than one.

39:14.120 --> 39:16.520
Particularly if one is mine.

39:50.080 --> 39:52.150
Where are the gardens?

40:04.680 --> 40:07.780
This is the ward where
your cousin will be.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.640
Are all the wards locked?

40:11.400 --> 40:12.840
A few.

40:17.120 --> 40:20.510
He... he's very young.
He shouldn't be locked in.

40:20.560 --> 40:21.910
It's for the patients' own safety.

40:21.960 --> 40:24.030
Many of them have suffered a great deal

40:24.080 --> 40:25.830
in the outside world, Mr Buckle.

40:25.880 --> 40:28.750
It's our duty to prevent more anxiety.

40:29.440 --> 40:31.580
Which bed would be his?

40:31.800 --> 40:33.940
That one. In the corner.

40:41.720 --> 40:42.870
I feel sick.

40:42.920 --> 40:45.630
I think you're still bleeding
a little. Keep biting down.

40:45.680 --> 40:49.110
No! I don't feel well.

40:49.160 --> 40:53.270
It's just the effects of the
anaesthetic. It will pass.

40:53.320 --> 40:56.320
I'll see if someone can bring you a bowl.

40:58.120 --> 41:00.390
I think the baby's coming.

41:03.720 --> 41:05.920
I think you may be right.

41:07.160 --> 41:11.790
Let's get you up to the maternity
ward, and have a proper look at you.

41:11.840 --> 41:13.350
Where are you going?

41:13.400 --> 41:15.590
It seems Mrs Williams
has gone into labour.

41:15.640 --> 41:16.950
- Here?
- Yes. Here!

41:17.000 --> 41:19.030
And it's baby number five,
so unless we get a move on,

41:19.080 --> 41:21.630
you're going to have a lot more
than amniotic fluid on your chair.

41:21.680 --> 41:22.910
- I'm coming with you.
- Thank you.

41:22.960 --> 41:24.910
But I'm sure we'll have
plenty of help on the ward.

41:24.960 --> 41:27.470
I need to keep an eye on this bleeding.

41:27.520 --> 41:30.260
And Mrs Williams needs a wheelchair.

41:33.760 --> 41:35.990
Try not to push. Can
you pant for me instead?

41:36.040 --> 41:39.240
That's it. Keep panting.
We're nearly there.

42:20.280 --> 42:22.560
Sister Mary Cynthia?

43:03.840 --> 43:09.710
We must muster our cohorts.
We must instruct our troops.

43:09.760 --> 43:12.030
An innocent is in danger,

43:12.080 --> 43:17.910
and one of our own is immured
in a place of torment.

43:21.520 --> 43:24.760
Sister. Please, just let me drive.

43:36.440 --> 43:38.830
Baby's nearly here, Crystal!

43:38.880 --> 43:42.350
Your body's done this so many times,
baby hardly needs any help at all.

43:42.400 --> 43:46.670
Good girl, good girl,

43:46.720 --> 43:49.470
Well done, keep breathing.

43:49.520 --> 43:52.030
It's all right, Crystal. Here's the gas.

43:52.080 --> 43:54.830
Mrs Williams doesn't need any gas
for this procedure, Mr Dockerill.

43:54.880 --> 43:57.830
She's managing beautifully without.

43:57.880 --> 43:59.750
And push now!

43:59.800 --> 44:01.470
That's it.

44:01.520 --> 44:03.990
I can see baby's head, Crystal!

44:04.760 --> 44:06.830
Yes! That's wonderful.

44:07.400 --> 44:09.470
Catch your breath now, sweetie.

44:09.520 --> 44:12.390
One more push and it will all be over.

44:14.160 --> 44:15.590
And push!

44:15.640 --> 44:17.950
Push!

44:18.000 --> 44:20.510
That's it! That's it!

44:20.560 --> 44:22.030
That's it!

44:25.440 --> 44:27.790
- Oh.
- Wonderful!

44:27.840 --> 44:29.350
Well done! Well done!

44:29.400 --> 44:32.440
I have done this once or
twice before, Mr Dockerill.

44:35.640 --> 44:37.870
Aren't you beautiful?

44:46.960 --> 44:49.100
Time to meet your mummy.

44:51.520 --> 44:55.320
Congratulations, Crystal!
You've got a little boy.

45:02.800 --> 45:07.280
Oh, he's perfect... and beautiful.

45:10.360 --> 45:13.110
And he's going to take care of his teeth.

45:13.160 --> 45:17.230
I don't want him to go through
what I've been through.

45:17.280 --> 45:19.020
Thank you both.

45:24.760 --> 45:28.060
Sister. You've been with
us for some time now.

45:28.760 --> 45:32.470
Your psychiatrist thinks
you've shown little improvement.

45:32.520 --> 45:37.440
I don't know how to do it. I don't
know how I can put things right.

45:39.040 --> 45:41.960
Putting things right is what WE do.

45:44.160 --> 45:48.230
Your psychiatrist would like to
try another course of treatment.

45:48.280 --> 45:49.510
What treatment?

45:49.560 --> 45:52.870
It's called electroconvulsive therapy.

45:52.920 --> 45:54.720
I don't want it.

45:56.000 --> 45:59.270
I'll be knocked out and when I
open my eyes again, things will

45:59.320 --> 46:01.670
have been done to me without me knowing!

46:01.720 --> 46:04.390
We believe it would be the most
suitable treatment for you.

46:04.440 --> 46:06.310
You don't know that and
you can't know that,

46:06.360 --> 46:08.630
because you don't know me!

46:08.760 --> 46:13.720
You can't see what I see
when I close my eyes.

46:24.760 --> 46:28.280
For the sake of our beloved
Sister Mary Cynthia...

46:29.400 --> 46:32.070
.. we must keep this to ourselves.

46:32.880 --> 46:35.820
Until I have spoken to the Mother House.

46:37.200 --> 46:39.950
Sister, do you understand?

46:40.000 --> 46:42.720
I have seen the darkness.

46:43.960 --> 46:45.760
You have my word.

46:47.840 --> 46:49.430
Thank you, Fred.

46:49.480 --> 46:50.960
Thank you.

47:23.720 --> 47:24.790
Where is he?

47:24.840 --> 47:28.840
He's in the back. Doing
some tidying for me.

47:29.960 --> 47:32.470
Well, you can stop fretting.

47:32.520 --> 47:35.110
He's not going there. Not now.

47:35.160 --> 47:36.750
Not ever.

47:36.800 --> 47:40.390
And if I could've brought them
all home with me, I would have.

47:40.440 --> 47:43.840
Well, that means he's stuck with us, then.

47:59.400 --> 48:01.230
Where are they going?

48:01.280 --> 48:03.030
Work. Where we all have to go.

48:03.080 --> 48:06.990
- I don't. - What's wrong with your
face? It's like a long wet weekend.

48:07.040 --> 48:08.830
I don't have any friends.

48:08.880 --> 48:11.080
Yes, you do. You have us.

48:12.160 --> 48:13.700
You're old.

48:31.480 --> 48:34.070
I'm afraid if you wish to
see Sister Mary Cynthia,

48:34.120 --> 48:36.030
you must make an appointment.

48:36.080 --> 48:38.710
She is extremely unwell,
and has been for some time.

48:38.760 --> 48:40.750
Then all the more reason for you

48:40.800 --> 48:43.470
to consider releasing her into our care.

48:43.520 --> 48:45.870
We are not psychiatric
nurses but we are nurses.

48:45.920 --> 48:48.830
And we know at least something
of the strains that have

48:48.880 --> 48:50.190
triggered her depression.

48:50.240 --> 48:53.750
She needs medical expertise,
and specialised treatment.

48:53.800 --> 48:58.030
Not sympathy and understanding,
however well intentioned.

48:58.080 --> 49:00.630
I think sympathy and understanding

49:00.680 --> 49:03.680
might be a good starting point, don't you?

49:04.760 --> 49:07.750
This is a mental hospital, Sister.

49:07.800 --> 49:11.400
It takes more than kind
words to cure our patients.

49:18.480 --> 49:23.550
- That's it. - Right into the
back of your mouth. Up and down.

49:23.600 --> 49:26.430
Oh, very good. Very good!

49:26.480 --> 49:30.120
Sister, you are a miracle worker.

49:43.560 --> 49:48.350
I must say, Sister, I am a
little surprised by your request.

49:48.400 --> 49:51.390
- Are you quite sure?
- Absolutely positive.

49:51.440 --> 49:57.470
You want to learn to drive and you
want me to teach you, in my car?

49:57.520 --> 50:01.630
Yes, Nurse Crane. That's it in a nutshell.

50:01.680 --> 50:04.750
I've always wanted to learn
but never had the courage.

50:04.800 --> 50:08.470
Now, thanks to my work
here with all of you,

50:08.520 --> 50:12.440
I've come to fully appreciate that
there is no time like the present.

50:15.760 --> 50:18.710
Faced with such enthusiasm,
what choice have I got?

50:18.760 --> 50:20.750
Oh, yes!

50:20.800 --> 50:23.950
I read about the Glasshouse
Village Trust in the newspaper.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.630
It's in the country, Mrs Buckle,
surrounded by green fields.

50:27.680 --> 50:29.390
It's a community.

50:29.440 --> 50:31.910
People with all kinds of
disabilities live and work there.

50:31.960 --> 50:33.590
And they earn money.

50:33.640 --> 50:37.590
How can they do that? I
mean, who looks after them?

50:37.640 --> 50:40.030
They have trained staff
who look after them,

50:40.080 --> 50:42.070
24 hours a day, but they're free.

50:42.120 --> 50:45.120
To live as near a normal life as they can.

50:46.360 --> 50:49.510
I don't think so. I don't
like the look of it.

50:49.560 --> 50:53.590
Why don't you both just think
about it? There's no rush.

50:53.640 --> 50:57.790
We just wanted you to know that
there were places like that.

50:57.840 --> 51:01.270
There are only two or three at
the moment, in the whole country.

51:01.320 --> 51:04.190
But I have no doubt
that there will be more.

51:04.240 --> 51:08.310
It seems like the ideal environment
for someone like Reggie to...

51:08.360 --> 51:09.910
to grow in confidence.

51:09.960 --> 51:13.110
He won't be on his own there.

51:13.160 --> 51:15.150
He is lonely.

51:15.200 --> 51:18.270
No, he's not. He's happy.

51:18.320 --> 51:23.310
He needs friends, Vi. Folk like him.

51:23.360 --> 51:26.630
A chance to make his own decisions.

51:26.680 --> 51:29.150
He's a young man, not a child.

51:32.560 --> 51:35.310
Just have a think. There's no rush.

51:35.360 --> 51:38.100
You need to know it's right for him.

51:40.400 --> 51:42.150
That's excellent, Mrs Williams.

51:42.200 --> 51:44.150
You look so relaxed you could be lying on

51:44.200 --> 51:46.540
a deck chair at the seaside.

51:46.840 --> 51:49.270
How do they feel?

51:49.320 --> 51:53.190
Peculiar. Like I've got
a mouth full of marbles.

51:53.240 --> 51:56.340
That will improve, as
you get used to them.

51:56.960 --> 51:59.310
Ready for the grand unveiling?

51:59.360 --> 52:03.460
You may have to imagine the
fanfare and the roll of drums.

52:27.760 --> 52:30.710
- Thank you ever so much.
- Not at all.

52:30.760 --> 52:32.600
Come on.

52:33.600 --> 52:36.030
Thank you for your help with
Mrs Williams, Nurse Franklin.

52:36.080 --> 52:37.630
Well, with one thing and another,

52:37.680 --> 52:40.590
I think we all ended up with
something to smile about.

52:40.640 --> 52:44.240
It's nice to have a case
with such a happy outcome.

52:46.400 --> 52:49.750
Nice enough -- and rare enough --

52:49.800 --> 52:53.640
to warrant a little celebration.

52:54.720 --> 53:00.070
- Such as dinner for two?
- For two, Mr Dockerill?

53:00.120 --> 53:02.750
You could call me Christopher, now we're

53:02.800 --> 53:05.830
no longer quite so
professionally intertwined.

53:05.880 --> 53:10.390
And, as we are no longer quite
so professionally intertwined,

53:10.440 --> 53:13.710
I can see no harm in
accepting your invitation...

53:13.760 --> 53:14.790
Christopher.

53:14.840 --> 53:18.160
And my name is Beatrix,
but people call me Trixie.

53:23.760 --> 53:24.950
Ohh!

53:25.000 --> 53:27.400
Left foot down on the clutch.

53:29.240 --> 53:32.550
Now right foot on the accelerator, gently.

53:32.600 --> 53:34.430
Which one is that again?

53:34.480 --> 53:36.750
The one nearest your door.

53:38.400 --> 53:40.540
Put it into first gear.

53:41.360 --> 53:46.840
Good, that's good. Now, bring the
clutch gently up to biting point.

53:48.720 --> 53:50.390
And we're off.

53:55.280 --> 53:56.710
Keep going smoothly,

53:56.760 --> 54:00.560
don't keep putting your foot
on the... you're braking.

54:04.120 --> 54:07.320
I'll show you to your
dormitory in a minute.

54:17.480 --> 54:19.670
What do you think of our greenhouse?

54:19.720 --> 54:21.710
It's all right.

54:21.760 --> 54:24.360
What do you do for a job, Reggie?

54:26.840 --> 54:30.480
- I'm a gardener.
- That's good. We always need gardeners.

54:32.760 --> 54:34.900
Don't worry, Auntie Vi.

54:39.800 --> 54:41.940
I'm not sad, I'm happy.

54:49.800 --> 54:53.430
Look at the garden,
Patrick. It's so beautiful.

54:53.480 --> 54:57.110
There'll be so much space for the
little ones to run around in.

54:57.160 --> 54:59.630
Ah, it's certainly big enough.

55:00.000 --> 55:03.200
Our furniture is going
to get lost in there.

55:05.120 --> 55:08.820
Well, we can fill a few
rooms, then grow from there.

55:22.920 --> 55:24.920
Bless him.

55:30.160 --> 55:32.070
Oh, er, what's for tea then?

55:32.120 --> 55:34.270
Dunno. What do you fancy?

55:34.320 --> 55:37.320
Anything as long as it's not rice pudding.

55:46.240 --> 55:47.780
Oh, Reggie.

56:02.520 --> 56:05.430
And so we let go of their hands...

56:05.480 --> 56:07.830
but not their hearts.

56:07.880 --> 56:11.640
Of the need to be needed
but not the need to love.

56:17.160 --> 56:19.030
We're going to a French place.

56:19.080 --> 56:21.870
And if it's French, they'll serve snails,

56:21.920 --> 56:25.910
and snails always involve bent pins,
garlic butter and finger bowls.

56:25.960 --> 56:30.430
Which, all in all, means quite a
lot of attention on one's manicure.

56:30.480 --> 56:34.150
Meanwhile I'll be sat in a
darkened cinema with Tom,

56:34.200 --> 56:36.910
watching The Loneliness Of
The Long Distance Runner.

56:36.960 --> 56:39.430
Won't be much need for a manicure there.

56:39.480 --> 56:42.160
No. You look very lovely, Barbara.

56:43.320 --> 56:45.150
So do you.

56:45.200 --> 56:47.540
I'll zip you up in a minute.

56:57.800 --> 57:02.310
And however much it hurts, there
is joy within that moment.

57:02.360 --> 57:05.350
Because of the unseen cord that binds us,

57:05.400 --> 57:08.080
and which will never break.

57:15.240 --> 57:19.510
Linchmere is not an appropriate
environment for Sister Mary Cynthia.

57:19.560 --> 57:21.670
We have to secure her discharge.

57:21.720 --> 57:26.030
Do you mind me asking -- have you
had any... surgery down there?

57:26.080 --> 57:27.910
Is there something wrong?

57:27.960 --> 57:30.550
A lady doesn't like to look too keen.

57:30.600 --> 57:32.550
Especially when a man drives a sports car.

57:32.600 --> 57:35.230
If the USSR doesn't
accept Kennedy's deal...

57:35.280 --> 57:37.590
then we're all going
to hell in a hand cart!

57:37.640 --> 57:41.690
I really don't think this is
the time for levity, Barbara!

57:41.740 --> 57:42.740
Pull over.
