WEBVTT

00:05.740 --> 00:07.806
(theme music)

00:33.367 --> 00:35.734
(♪♪)

00:46.280 --> 00:48.614
- It's absurd that you should
have to go to work at this hour.

00:48.749 --> 00:50.816
- Well, it's just
until halley's comet is set.

00:50.885 --> 00:52.618
It brings out the crazy
in people, you know?

00:52.620 --> 00:54.018
(hadfield): Unhand me,
constable!

00:54.055 --> 00:55.687
I will not be treated
as a thief.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.155
I didn't take anything
of value.

00:57.291 --> 00:58.356
- Uh, what's going on here?

00:59.427 --> 01:02.694
- I confiscated some pills
from a charlatan

01:02.763 --> 01:05.430
Who claimed they'd provide
protection against the cyanogen

01:05.499 --> 01:06.765
From the comet's tail.

01:06.767 --> 01:09.000
- Well, we pass through
the comet's tail tomorrow night.

01:09.036 --> 01:12.571
- Yes, but the... The gas
will be way too diffuse
to have any effect.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.706
He was just preying
on weak minds.

01:14.708 --> 01:17.309
- I'll take care of this,
constable.

01:17.378 --> 01:19.912
So, this offended you
as a citizen?

01:19.914 --> 01:22.514
- It offended me
as a rational human being.

01:23.617 --> 01:25.717
- Well, I appreciate
your rationality, sir.

01:25.853 --> 01:27.385
I'll let you off with it
this time,

01:27.387 --> 01:29.054
But no more confiscating pills.

01:30.057 --> 01:31.923
- People just need to see that

01:31.992 --> 01:34.659
Halley's comet is this
big snowball

01:34.728 --> 01:36.528
That's circling around the sun

01:36.564 --> 01:39.398
And this is our
once-in-a-lifetime privilege

01:39.533 --> 01:40.599
To be able to see it.

01:40.734 --> 01:44.136
- Well, it is going to be
a wonderful sight.

01:44.271 --> 01:45.938
You seem to know a lot
about it.

01:46.073 --> 01:48.673
- Space is an interest of mine.
I'm a scientist.

01:48.709 --> 01:51.109
- Oh! So's my father.
What field?

01:51.112 --> 01:53.112
- Uh, engineering, mostly.

01:53.247 --> 01:54.746
But I'm also a rocket man.

01:55.716 --> 01:56.949
- A rocket man?

01:56.951 --> 01:58.750
- Yeah, low earth orbit,
mostly.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.886
Circling the earth
every 92 minutes.

02:02.689 --> 02:04.823
It's lonely out in space.

02:09.096 --> 02:12.030
- What did I tell you?
People are going mad already.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.666
(indistinct chatter)

02:18.372 --> 02:19.838
(man): So long, world.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.973
So long!
We're all going to die!

02:22.009 --> 02:25.043
- It's lovely, isn't it?
- It is.

02:25.112 --> 02:27.512
I just wish people weren't so...

02:27.515 --> 02:29.715
- Stupid?
- Well, that's one word.

02:29.850 --> 02:34.252
Look, I have to check out
a break-in that was reported
earlier on tate st.

02:34.288 --> 02:35.921
(groaning softly)

02:36.790 --> 02:38.189
- Suppose I'll see you at home.

02:38.225 --> 02:39.357
- You will.

02:40.661 --> 02:41.759
- Mm.

02:42.462 --> 02:43.795
Goodnight, constable.

02:44.398 --> 02:46.965
(hubbub)

02:50.871 --> 02:53.605
- It's the end of the world!
- Sir, wait, let go of me!

02:53.740 --> 02:55.073
- You have to believe me!

02:55.075 --> 02:58.142
- Sir.
- It's the end.

02:58.179 --> 03:00.345
- Sir.
- The end.

03:00.347 --> 03:01.280
(thudding)

03:04.485 --> 03:07.085
(intriguing music)

03:12.359 --> 03:14.159
(crabtree): Just rushed up
and grabbed me, sir!

03:14.161 --> 03:15.560
Nearly scared me to death.

03:15.563 --> 03:17.829
He was going on
about the end of the world.

03:17.965 --> 03:20.165
I just assumed it was another
chap gone loony from the comet.

03:21.068 --> 03:22.501
- Any witnesses?

03:22.503 --> 03:24.503
- Not to his stabbing, sir,
but somebody remembered

03:24.638 --> 03:26.104
Seeing him
near king and sumach.

03:27.942 --> 03:32.243
- Appears to have been stabbed
at least four times.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.780
(crabtree): Sir, have a look
at his knees.

03:34.782 --> 03:37.515
(murdoch): Yes, he was
definitely kneeling
in something.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.986
(♪♪)

03:44.124 --> 03:47.525
(brackenreid): Humber station
to don station, 8:15 pm.

03:47.561 --> 03:51.329
- Humber station is just
north of bolton on the cp line.

03:51.465 --> 03:53.331
- So, if he left at 8:15...

03:53.400 --> 03:56.234
- He'd have arrived at
don station shortly after nine.

03:56.270 --> 03:57.435
- And he was killed when?

03:57.437 --> 03:58.703
- Roughly 11:30.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.340
- So he knocked around
for a couple of hours.

04:01.475 --> 04:03.742
Perhaps he's from here.
Do we have a name?

04:03.811 --> 04:06.411
- No name. No witnesses.
No motive.

04:06.413 --> 04:09.748
I've asked henry to pass
his photograph around the area.

04:09.817 --> 04:11.716
- If you ask me,
it's all this comet madness.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.619
The whole city's gone crackers.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.288
Thank god it only happens
once every 76 years.

04:16.357 --> 04:19.223
- Sirs, look at this.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.059
- What is it, george?

04:21.194 --> 04:23.228
- Well, it's not pertaining
to the case directly, sir.

04:23.363 --> 04:25.497
(murdoch): "mr. Crabtree,
your skills as a creative

04:25.632 --> 04:29.367
And original thinker
make you an ideal asset

04:29.403 --> 04:31.402
For a project
of great importance

04:31.438 --> 04:34.039
For the future of humanity."

04:34.041 --> 04:35.340
- Huh.

04:35.409 --> 04:37.175
(murdoch): "please attend
our presentation.

04:37.244 --> 04:41.646
Convene outside the elmwood
arms hotel at noon."

04:41.649 --> 04:44.082
Today?
- Not bloody likely.

04:44.084 --> 04:46.451
- But, sir, it's regarding
the, uh, uh...

04:46.520 --> 04:47.719
Future of humanity.

04:47.854 --> 04:50.389
- An original thinker?
That's a kind way of putting it.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.390
(sighs)
- you don't know who sent this?

04:52.426 --> 04:53.658
- No, sir.

04:53.727 --> 04:56.528
- Well, george, we do have
a case to solve.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.663
- Well, I know, but--
- good morning, all.

04:58.666 --> 05:00.932
Look, william.
This came in the mail.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.334
- Oh, that's just like mine!
- Oh! So it is.

05:03.370 --> 05:04.536
Ha! Curious.

05:05.773 --> 05:07.873
- "dr. Ogden, your skills
in the fields of medicine

05:07.875 --> 05:10.541
And psychology make you
an ideal asset

05:10.577 --> 05:12.344
For a project
of great importance

05:12.346 --> 05:13.811
For the future of humanity."

05:13.847 --> 05:15.880
(julia): They want us to convene
at noon.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.150
- You're going, then?

05:18.152 --> 05:21.219
- Of course we are! We wouldn't
want the future of humanity

05:21.221 --> 05:23.154
To be imperiled by our absence.

05:23.223 --> 05:24.823
- My thought exactly, doctor.

05:24.892 --> 05:27.025
- Oh! Look at the time.
We should run.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.229
- Thank you, sir.

05:33.633 --> 05:35.967
- Bloody hell, murdoch.
You're a soft touch.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.235
- Well, I--

05:39.340 --> 05:41.973
- Well, this is quite
the gathering.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.708
- I recognize a few people.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.176
- As do I.

05:45.212 --> 05:46.644
From the university, mostly.

05:47.647 --> 05:49.514
- George crabtree!

05:49.516 --> 05:51.082
- Miss struthers!

05:51.118 --> 05:54.452
Are you also considered
indispensable to the future
of humanity?

05:54.588 --> 05:58.256
- I'm needed for my innovative
approach to applied mathematics.

05:58.258 --> 05:59.257
- Ah! Indeed.

05:59.393 --> 06:01.459
Ah, dr. Ogden,
this is melody struthers.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.128
- Do you know
what this is all about?

06:03.130 --> 06:04.496
- Not the foggiest.

06:04.565 --> 06:07.665
And if anyone else does,
they're not saying.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.268
(bartman): Ladies and gentlemen.

06:10.270 --> 06:11.603
Thank you for coming.

06:11.672 --> 06:12.804
(julia): Oh my goodness.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.206
- Do you know this chap?

06:14.208 --> 06:16.475
- That's mason bartman,
the philanthropist.

06:25.152 --> 06:26.651
(brackenreid): What's all this,
then?

06:26.787 --> 06:30.088
- The victim had been kneeling
in some kind of solution.

06:30.223 --> 06:33.357
If I can determine what it is,
it could inform our search.

06:33.394 --> 06:34.792
- Hence the apparatus.

06:35.295 --> 06:36.694
- The a...

06:36.696 --> 06:38.563
Apparatus! Yes.

06:38.599 --> 06:44.436
Yes. Ah, pure water is
conductive, but salt water...

06:45.639 --> 06:47.105
(electricity crackling)

06:47.174 --> 06:48.440
Is more so.

06:48.442 --> 06:50.341
- Bloody hell, look at that.

06:51.645 --> 06:54.045
So, if you knew it was salt,
why not just taste it?

06:54.047 --> 06:55.447
- Because.

06:55.449 --> 06:56.714
Could have been arsenic.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.250
- Genius.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.785
So, he was kneeling in salt?

07:00.788 --> 07:04.389
- Brine, I suspect.
Fairly concentrated at that.

07:05.192 --> 07:06.524
- Where would that happen?

07:06.660 --> 07:08.927
A salt lick.
He was a farmer.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.796
Or meat packing?
Lots of salt there.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.997
- Most use refrigeration
nowadays.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.033
- Salt mine.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.136
There's an old brine well up
near bolton.

07:19.173 --> 07:20.939
Margaret's brother-in-law
used to work there.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.340
- Bolton?

07:25.412 --> 07:26.645
(rustling)

07:26.780 --> 07:28.012
Bolton.

07:33.887 --> 07:34.953
There it is.

07:35.088 --> 07:36.754
(brackenreid): Less than
a mile from humber station.

07:36.756 --> 07:38.690
- That can't be a coincidence.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.157
- Probably not.

07:43.464 --> 07:45.596
- If we hurry we can make
the 12:45.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.333
(intriguing music)

07:49.870 --> 07:52.169
(train chugging)

08:00.347 --> 08:01.979
(birds squawking)

08:03.717 --> 08:05.116
- It looks to be abandoned.

08:05.252 --> 08:07.919
- Hm.
Doesn't seem operational.

08:07.988 --> 08:11.389
But there were loads of fresh
carriage tracks at the gate.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.064
- Oh...

08:26.139 --> 08:27.638
What's this then?

08:28.475 --> 08:30.074
- Not as derelict as we assumed.

08:31.245 --> 08:32.810
- Looks like an elevator.

08:33.514 --> 08:34.946
But there's no buttons.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.682
- There's a ladder here.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.686
(brackenreid): How far,
do you think?

08:41.755 --> 08:43.288
(murdoch): I can't see
the bottom.

08:43.357 --> 08:45.290
If it reaches the saline
stratum,

08:45.292 --> 08:47.392
Could be several hundred feet.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.561
- You go ahead.
I'll stay up here.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.832
(mysterious music)

08:54.868 --> 08:56.167
- After you.

09:05.579 --> 09:08.212
(indistinct chatter)

09:13.787 --> 09:15.987
Oh.
- Crikey.

09:16.523 --> 09:17.889
- Names, please.

09:18.024 --> 09:19.858
- Oh, uh,
this is detective murdoch

09:19.860 --> 09:22.260
And I'm inspector brackenreid
of the toronto constabulary.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.195
- Neither of you is an invitee.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.330
- We're here on police business.

09:26.366 --> 09:27.665
- You're out
of your jurisdiction.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.867
I must ask you to leave.
- What are you two doing here?

09:30.870 --> 09:33.104
- Oh! I could ask the same.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.339
- Uh, sir, we're still not quite
sure, but look:

09:35.375 --> 09:37.274
We've been given these lovely
pocket watches.

09:37.311 --> 09:39.043
- Ooh! I'll have one of those.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.946
- Ah, ah, ah, ah.
- Oi.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.814
- Perhaps I haven't made
myself clear.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.849
- We're on a murder
investigation.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.351
Now unless--
- shush.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.319
The presentation's
about to begin.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.623
- Hm.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.294
(mysterious music)

09:57.798 --> 09:59.764
- Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen.

09:59.899 --> 10:01.165
Thank you for coming

10:01.201 --> 10:04.335
And welcome
to the end of the world.

10:06.673 --> 10:08.506
(♪♪)

10:13.180 --> 10:15.913
For 76 years, we knew this
fellow was coming.

10:15.949 --> 10:19.784
We didn't know exactly
when or where.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.652
The complexities of orbital
mechanics

10:21.688 --> 10:23.988
Make such predictions
impossible.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.124
But among them was
a low probability

10:26.259 --> 10:29.026
That halley's comet
would collide with earth.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.062
(indistinct whispering)

10:31.098 --> 10:34.532
It's happened before,
more times than we can count.

10:35.736 --> 10:38.803
The meteor that made this
was 150 feet in diameter.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.339
The resulting crater
was 40 times that size.

10:41.341 --> 10:44.542
Now imagine if earth
was struck by an object

10:44.578 --> 10:47.411
10 million times as massive.

10:47.447 --> 10:48.813
That's halley's comet.

10:50.016 --> 10:51.549
A collision of that magnitude
would destroy

10:51.618 --> 10:54.419
Every remnant
of human civilization.

10:54.488 --> 10:56.020
(panicked whispering)

10:56.056 --> 10:59.557
I wish I could say that this was
the greatest danger we face.

10:59.693 --> 11:03.695
But with each technology comes
new and more terrible weapons.

11:03.697 --> 11:06.130
We know too much of the folly
of human nature

11:06.199 --> 11:08.633
To believe that we wouldn't use
them against each other

11:08.635 --> 11:11.602
In an orgy
of self-annihilation.

11:12.673 --> 11:13.971
So, what are we to do?

11:15.008 --> 11:17.108
While the threats we face
are existential,

11:17.110 --> 11:19.310
Their probability is unknowable.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.714
But as I say,
it's happened before.

11:23.550 --> 11:24.782
(laughter)

11:26.219 --> 11:29.887
Laugh if you must, but this
is what I'm proposing, folks.

11:31.058 --> 11:33.657
A repository of our accumulated
human knowledge

11:33.694 --> 11:36.928
And those humans best suited
to its continuation.

11:36.997 --> 11:40.297
Thanks to our benefactor,
mason bartman.

11:40.333 --> 11:44.535
And the tireless efforts
of the team tasked with its
design and construction,

11:44.604 --> 11:47.672
We have made such an ark here,
in the cavity

11:47.741 --> 11:49.274
Left by this old brine well.

11:49.409 --> 11:52.610
Each of you has been chosen
for your skills and expertise

11:52.679 --> 11:55.680
In not just maintaining
the human species,

11:55.815 --> 11:59.617
But of society itself
and accumulated knowledge.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.520
These are more than
just party gifts.

12:03.990 --> 12:07.425
In the event of a sudden
catastrophe, an alarm will
sound.

12:08.962 --> 12:11.095
(alarm ringing)

12:11.131 --> 12:13.164
Upon hearing this,

12:13.200 --> 12:17.168
You are to return
to this facility
with your immediate family.

12:17.237 --> 12:20.705
You will likely never get
the call,

12:20.707 --> 12:22.974
But if you do,

12:23.109 --> 12:26.244
The future of mankind depends
on your heeding it.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.246
Thank you.

12:28.915 --> 12:31.448
(applause)

12:36.323 --> 12:38.055
- I'm not sure I want
the responsibility

12:38.125 --> 12:39.424
Of saving humanity.

12:39.559 --> 12:42.059
- I suspect you won't be
required to heed the call

12:42.095 --> 12:43.861
Anytime soon.

12:43.897 --> 12:46.597
- I suppose some of us are
not good enough?

12:46.633 --> 12:48.132
- Well, inspector,
I'd invite you,

12:48.201 --> 12:50.468
But you heard what he said:
Immediate family only.

12:50.470 --> 12:51.769
- Mm.

12:51.805 --> 12:54.405
- Thank you so much for coming.
I really appreciate--

12:54.541 --> 12:56.207
- Ah, james!
Quite the presentation.

12:56.276 --> 12:59.010
- George, julia.
Thank you so much for coming.

12:59.145 --> 13:01.745
- Murdoch and I are just
here on business, apparently.

13:01.782 --> 13:03.247
- I'm afraid to ask.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.219
(murdoch): You happen to know
this man?

13:09.088 --> 13:11.255
- Dear god.
That's kenvyn.

13:11.324 --> 13:12.389
- Kenvyn?

13:13.126 --> 13:14.292
- Wiley. He worked for me.

13:15.662 --> 13:18.029
- He was found stabbed to death
last night in corktown.

13:18.031 --> 13:20.765
- Corktown.
- Does this surprise you?

13:20.834 --> 13:22.233
- Well, I thought
he was here last night.

13:22.269 --> 13:23.635
I didn't know that he'd left.

13:23.637 --> 13:25.970
Vagle, what time
did kenvyn sign out?

13:26.039 --> 13:28.573
- He didn't. I noted his absence
as I was closing up.

13:28.642 --> 13:31.042
- What time was that?
- Shortly before midnight.

13:31.111 --> 13:32.710
- When did you last see him?

13:32.746 --> 13:35.846
- Well, at supper. He was dining
with mr. Pendrick and bartman.

13:35.882 --> 13:37.382
- That's right. About 7:00.

13:37.517 --> 13:40.718
- Did you notice anything
unusual in his demeanour?

13:40.720 --> 13:43.087
- It was the night before
the launch. I doubt I'd notice.

13:43.089 --> 13:44.355
Thank you.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.925
- He had been kneeling in brine.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.259
- Where could this have
happened?

13:49.462 --> 13:51.796
- Above us is 600 feet of shale
and limestone

13:51.931 --> 13:53.598
But flowing over that is
the humber river.

13:53.733 --> 13:55.733
Water gets in.
It's rare, but it happens.

13:55.802 --> 13:57.001
Is it important?

13:57.671 --> 13:58.736
- I don't know yet.

13:58.738 --> 14:00.638
- Well, my team
is at your disposal.

14:00.707 --> 14:01.873
How can we help you,
detective?

14:02.976 --> 14:04.609
- Now that our victim
has a name,

14:04.611 --> 14:06.411
I suppose I'd like to know
more about him.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.679
- Well, all my personnel files
are kept in the library.

14:08.748 --> 14:09.747
Come with me.

14:09.816 --> 14:12.684
- Mr. Pendrick,
um, why a brine well?

14:12.819 --> 14:15.086
- Well, no excavation
was necessary.

14:15.088 --> 14:17.288
We simply moved into
an existing space

14:17.290 --> 14:20.291
And salt is an excellent medium
for long-term storage.

14:20.293 --> 14:23.294
And being 600 feet deep,
we're insulated

14:23.296 --> 14:26.664
From the effects of any calamity
that may occur on the surface.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.837
(julia): This is your library?

14:32.839 --> 14:36.307
- To save space, all documents
are filmed and then projected.

14:36.442 --> 14:39.243
These cabinets contain all
current scientific publications,

14:39.246 --> 14:41.979
Plus an assortment of
the great works of literature.

14:43.316 --> 14:46.517
I'm afraid your respective
works have not been included

14:46.519 --> 14:48.486
In spite of their obvious merit.

14:48.621 --> 14:52.023
In your case, a crime-solving
manual would be unnecessary

14:52.158 --> 14:54.625
In a society without crime.

14:54.661 --> 14:58.463
- Wh--
- is that why william
wasn't invited?

14:58.598 --> 15:00.164
- Indeed.
Although a moot point,

15:00.233 --> 15:02.333
Given that he would be included
as a member of your family.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.402
- Ah.
(brackenreid): Where does
that leave me?

15:04.404 --> 15:07.471
- I'm sorry, tom, but,
um, friendship alone

15:07.507 --> 15:09.073
Cannot be a determining factor.

15:09.109 --> 15:10.675
- But crabtree makes the cut?

15:11.978 --> 15:14.545
- Well, george crabtree
sees things that others don't.

15:14.681 --> 15:17.681
He thinks outside the, um...

15:17.717 --> 15:19.283
- Realm of sanity?

15:19.286 --> 15:21.019
- Outside the box.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.754
- The bloody box? What box?

15:22.889 --> 15:25.889
- The box that holds the way
everybody else thinks.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.226
- Exactly. Well put.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.030
- Sir, I just felt a drop.

15:35.301 --> 15:36.701
(murdoch): Oh, yes.
Look at this.

15:36.770 --> 15:38.469
(brackenreid): Is this where
he kneeled, then?

15:39.906 --> 15:41.171
- I believe so.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.807
And if it was,

15:45.111 --> 15:46.444
Then it was likely...

15:46.446 --> 15:48.513
- How do you know
what he was looking for?

15:48.648 --> 15:50.781
- Well, this one is out
of place.

15:50.850 --> 15:54.151
"modern technology quarterly,
spring 1906."

15:54.688 --> 15:56.454
- Allow me.

15:59.793 --> 16:01.792
(whirring)

16:08.535 --> 16:10.668
- Seems the entire issue
is dedicated

16:10.803 --> 16:13.670
To the mechanized dispersal
of liquid aerosols.

16:13.707 --> 16:16.140
- Ooh.
It's a page-turner.

16:16.275 --> 16:18.142
- So why was wiley looking
at it?

16:18.277 --> 16:21.178
- I have no idea.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

16:31.557 --> 16:33.491
(whirring)

16:37.163 --> 16:38.496
Huh.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.364
Kenvyn had a master's degree
in biology.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.233
He lived in parkdale.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.101
- His ticket was
for the don station.

16:44.137 --> 16:46.237
- He likely wasn't going home,
then.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.840
- Oh! He was studying under
dr. Henry sandford.

16:49.876 --> 16:52.243
- Someone you know?
- Well, I did know him.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.044
He died a few years ago.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.913
He was working
on a plague vaccine.

16:55.982 --> 16:58.249
- Sandford.
- I've heard it's back.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.718
In india.
Maybe china?

17:00.853 --> 17:03.854
- Listen to this:
An ernestine sandford

17:03.890 --> 17:06.657
Reported a break-in
at her father's lab

17:06.726 --> 17:08.325
At 43 tate st.

17:08.395 --> 17:11.195
- When was this?
- 9:35 last night, sir.

17:12.398 --> 17:14.399
- Maybe that's what
wiley was doing in corktown.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.937
- I was fetching coal from
the bin

17:19.939 --> 17:22.206
When I heard someone rummaging
back here.

17:22.341 --> 17:23.941
They must have entered
through the window.

17:24.778 --> 17:26.210
- Did you get a look at him?

17:26.212 --> 17:27.612
- I didn't see him at all.

17:27.747 --> 17:30.214
I went back into the house
and telephoned the police.

17:30.250 --> 17:34.018
When I returned, I found
the tarp has been pulled off
my father's desk.

17:34.153 --> 17:37.088
His journal was opened
and this box was here.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.822
- This appears to be
a lab journal.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.926
(murdoch): This looks like
it's been in a fire.

17:43.930 --> 17:45.229
- Why would someone be
looking at these?

17:45.364 --> 17:48.232
- No idea. I didn't follow
my father's work.

17:49.502 --> 17:52.570
- Your father was researching
the bubonic plague?

17:52.639 --> 17:54.438
(julia): Pneumonic, actually.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.307
- Is there a difference?

17:56.442 --> 17:58.576
- Uh, bubonic is spread
by fleas.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.444
Pneumonic is transmissible
between humans

18:00.447 --> 18:02.280
And, in this case, rats.

18:02.282 --> 18:03.814
Oh, my goodness.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.116
- What is it?

18:05.118 --> 18:07.351
- There was an accidental
outbreak.

18:07.353 --> 18:10.087
Rats in separate cages
became infected.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.389
- Aerosol transmission?

18:12.425 --> 18:15.125
(julia): That's unusual for
the plague.

18:15.161 --> 18:17.328
- Perhaps it was a new strain?

18:18.598 --> 18:20.764
- The speed of infection
suggests a transmissibility

18:20.834 --> 18:23.201
Equal to or greater
than the measles.

18:23.336 --> 18:24.936
- My goodness.

18:24.938 --> 18:27.338
You can get the measles
from someone across the street.

18:27.340 --> 18:32.910
- He's left instructions that
these vials be burned in a kiln.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.480
- Why not do that himself?

18:35.615 --> 18:38.081
- Perhaps he realized that
he was infected.

18:39.685 --> 18:41.219
- That must be it.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.020
He never told me.

18:43.022 --> 18:46.557
I found the body and he left
instructions to be cremated.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.259
- He took his own life?

18:48.394 --> 18:51.061
- I never knew why until now.

18:52.832 --> 18:55.633
- He's highlighted a sequence
of numbers here.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.301
What are they?

18:57.337 --> 19:00.304
(julia): Ga-1731

19:00.439 --> 19:03.708
Through to ga-1738.

19:03.843 --> 19:06.176
Those are the vials he's
instructed to be incinerated.

19:06.212 --> 19:09.713
- These have been incinerated,
but the numbers don't match.

19:10.717 --> 19:13.651
Perhaps the wrong batch
was incinerated?

19:13.720 --> 19:16.119
- So what happened to the vials
containing the plague?

19:17.390 --> 19:19.856
- Is that why mr. Wiley
was looking at schematics

19:19.893 --> 19:21.859
For aerosol dispersal
mechanisms?

19:21.994 --> 19:26.264
- William, the pneumonic form
of the plague is 99% fatal.

19:27.667 --> 19:31.335
- It seems someone has created
a way of releasing a plague

19:31.470 --> 19:33.370
That would wipe out humanity.

19:35.208 --> 19:37.208
- Perhaps it is
the end of the world.

19:38.044 --> 19:40.644
(dramatic music)

19:43.616 --> 19:45.115
Ia): Here, look at this.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.286
- This is what
he was looking at?

19:48.288 --> 19:49.687
- Or one just like it.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.556
- The entire issue is
dedicated

19:51.691 --> 19:53.824
To pressurized liquid dispersal
mechanisms.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.325
- For what purpose?

19:55.361 --> 19:57.261
- Artificial pollination.

19:57.263 --> 19:58.128
- Fragrance.

19:58.164 --> 19:59.730
- Paint.

19:59.766 --> 20:00.931
- Paint?

20:00.967 --> 20:03.834
- The point is one of these
could be used

20:03.870 --> 20:06.670
For the rapid dispersal
of an aerosolized plague.

20:08.074 --> 20:09.840
- So what you're saying is that
there's some nutcase out there

20:09.909 --> 20:11.775
Hellbent on wiping out
humanity.

20:11.844 --> 20:14.178
- I honestly don't know
what is happening, sir,

20:14.313 --> 20:18.282
Only that we've discovered what
mr. Wiley himself was seeking.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.318
- So was wiley killed
by someone trying to stop him

20:21.387 --> 20:22.720
From releasing the plague?

20:22.722 --> 20:24.689
- I would think it was
the other way around:

20:24.824 --> 20:27.257
That he was trying to stop
his killer from releasing
the plague.

20:27.293 --> 20:28.392
- How's that?

20:28.527 --> 20:30.328
- Well, here he's been stabbed
several times

20:30.330 --> 20:32.396
And instead of finding himself
help, he comes to me

20:32.398 --> 20:33.931
To tell me that
it's the end of the world.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.466
- You think he was trying
to warn you.

20:36.636 --> 20:38.402
- Given the potential peril,

20:38.404 --> 20:40.604
We should assume
the threat remains.

20:40.673 --> 20:43.674
- If the intent is to release
a plague,

20:44.877 --> 20:47.678
Wouldn't it also come
with a plan to survive it?

20:48.948 --> 20:50.213
- The ark.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.848
Is pendrick behind this?

20:54.487 --> 20:55.686
- Impossible.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.889
- Kenvyn wiley worked with
dr. Sandford.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.624
He also worked on the ark.

21:00.693 --> 21:03.827
- I'm not denying
the coincidence of it, murdoch.

21:03.863 --> 21:06.897
Or the logic. I simply find it
beyond contemplation.

21:08.634 --> 21:10.234
- Who knew of the ark project?

21:10.369 --> 21:12.869
- Couple of hundred people.
It wasn't a well-kept secret.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.371
- Which of the invitees knew?

21:14.407 --> 21:15.839
(sighs)

21:15.875 --> 21:17.374
- I have no idea.

21:18.578 --> 21:20.177
None were told before
the launch,

21:20.246 --> 21:22.212
But word gets around.

21:23.182 --> 21:24.849
- Who originally
conceived of the ark?

21:25.584 --> 21:26.984
- I did, I suppose.

21:27.053 --> 21:27.985
- When?

21:28.988 --> 21:30.254
- Three years ago or
thereabouts.

21:30.323 --> 21:32.389
- Could you be more specific?

21:33.125 --> 21:34.991
- If necessary. Why?

21:35.028 --> 21:37.194
- Because we're bloody asking,
james!

21:38.298 --> 21:40.597
- The outbreak in dr. Sandford's
laboratory

21:40.633 --> 21:42.800
Occurred in June 1907.

21:42.869 --> 21:46.070
What we would like to know
is if the idea of the ark

21:46.139 --> 21:48.072
Arose subsequent to that.

21:49.508 --> 21:53.077
- The discussion was first
broached on the pendrick parlour

21:53.079 --> 21:55.612
Early in the fall semester.

21:55.614 --> 21:58.615
Someone posted a calculation
of the probability

21:58.617 --> 22:00.751
Of halley's comet colliding
with earth.

22:00.787 --> 22:02.219
It stirred a vigorous discussion

22:02.221 --> 22:04.488
In which I was
an active participant.

22:05.558 --> 22:07.290
Oh, dear god, murdoch.

22:08.294 --> 22:09.926
Was I manipulated?
Have I been duped?

22:09.962 --> 22:12.095
- Who else took part
in this discussion?

22:12.131 --> 22:14.765
- Mason bartman is the only one
I knew by name.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.433
Most people preferred
pseudonyms.

22:16.569 --> 22:18.736
- Is there any record
of these discussions?

22:18.871 --> 22:21.204
- Yes. The parlour
is closed,

22:21.240 --> 22:23.573
But most of the exchanges
in the public forum

22:23.609 --> 22:24.908
Have been archived.

22:24.944 --> 22:27.110
I'll have a portal
delivered immediately.

22:28.414 --> 22:29.914
- Sirs.

22:29.916 --> 22:31.115
- What have you, george?

22:31.117 --> 22:32.983
- I've been going through
dr. Sandford's research;

22:33.119 --> 22:34.518
A familiar name came up.

22:34.653 --> 22:36.487
- Well, spit it out, crabtree.

22:36.489 --> 22:38.456
- All this plague research

22:38.591 --> 22:40.591
Was funded by mason bartman.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.260
- I'm a philanthropist,
detective.

22:43.262 --> 22:45.028
I give to dozens of charities.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.131
- Why plague research?

22:48.167 --> 22:50.000
- Is that a serious question?

22:52.138 --> 22:55.639
Bubonic plague has devastated
the poor countries of asia.

22:55.641 --> 22:57.475
And, if I'm being serious,

22:57.477 --> 23:00.310
I was fearful of the outbreak
reaching canada.

23:01.313 --> 23:03.347
- Is that why you funded
the ark project?

23:04.150 --> 23:05.348
- It's one of the reasons.

23:06.386 --> 23:09.052
- Whose idea was it to build
this ark?

23:09.856 --> 23:11.422
- For all I know, it was mine.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.691
I'm a fearful man,
detective.

23:15.395 --> 23:16.693
I fear for my family.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.595
I fear for myself.
I fear for...

23:20.266 --> 23:22.833
We fly through
the comet's tail tonight.

23:24.303 --> 23:28.004
Scientists predicted that
cyanogen would poison us all.

23:29.008 --> 23:31.375
- Apparently that won't happen.

23:31.510 --> 23:33.010
- Perhaps,

23:33.079 --> 23:36.380
But I'll be spending tonight
in the ark with my family,

23:36.449 --> 23:37.448
Just in case.

23:38.484 --> 23:40.718
- Sir, I think
I've found something.

23:41.788 --> 23:43.320
- Thank you for your time,
mr. Bartman.

23:43.322 --> 23:45.088
- Yes, sir.
- Good day.

23:46.192 --> 23:47.992
- I've been through
the pendrick archives.

23:47.994 --> 23:49.727
- Did you find any relevant
discussions?

23:49.862 --> 23:51.996
- I did and then I went further
back and I found an exchange

23:52.131 --> 23:54.598
You'll definitely be interested
in between two people:

23:54.634 --> 23:58.869
"cat lady" and "lmn 899."
lmn writes:

23:59.004 --> 24:02.005
"population growth is
an exponential function.

24:02.041 --> 24:04.407
Humanity may be the pinnacle
of evolution,

24:04.444 --> 24:07.244
But it is a cancer on
the natural world."

24:07.379 --> 24:11.482
Cat lady responds: "well,
perhaps a cull is in order.

24:11.551 --> 24:14.084
What percentage do we
eliminate?"

24:14.086 --> 24:17.687
Lmn: "I say we go back
to day one."

24:17.723 --> 24:19.957
Cat lady: "make it day two.

24:20.026 --> 24:22.559
We'll need an adam
and an eve."

24:22.695 --> 24:27.498
Lmn: "h-a, h-a, h-a."

24:28.501 --> 24:29.566
- What is a--

24:29.602 --> 24:30.968
(laughing)

24:30.970 --> 24:34.905
- "we'll need an ark, too, if
we want to ride out the storm."

24:35.708 --> 24:37.240
- What date was this exchange?

24:37.276 --> 24:39.109
- Sir, August 12, 1907.

24:39.245 --> 24:42.713
- So about a month before
the purported ark discussions.

24:42.715 --> 24:43.981
- Cat lady then writes:

24:44.050 --> 24:46.850
"well, adam, it's a big job
we have ahead of us.

24:46.853 --> 24:49.920
How do you propose we go about
killing everybody but us?"

24:50.055 --> 24:51.322
And here's the clincher, sir.

24:51.324 --> 24:53.390
He writes, "well, eve.

24:53.459 --> 24:57.061
Pneumonic plague is
99% deadly.

24:57.063 --> 25:00.063
I'll take care of that.
You start building the ark."

25:01.000 --> 25:02.399
- Oh, we need to find
those two.

25:02.468 --> 25:05.402
- Sir, I have no idea
who lmn 899 could be,

25:05.404 --> 25:07.604
But I used to work
with a woman

25:07.740 --> 25:09.339
Whose parlour name was cat lady.

25:12.811 --> 25:16.013
- Your pseudonym is cat lady?

25:16.015 --> 25:17.414
- Yes.

25:17.416 --> 25:19.149
I like cats.

25:24.156 --> 25:27.725
Oh my god.
I remember this.

25:27.727 --> 25:28.826
- Mm.

25:29.896 --> 25:32.296
You're discussing
using pneumonic plague

25:32.365 --> 25:34.765
To wipe out humanity.
- Yes.

25:34.834 --> 25:36.567
But we weren't serious.

25:36.702 --> 25:39.203
You can't think this
represents an actual plan.

25:40.973 --> 25:42.640
It was a flirtation.

25:42.642 --> 25:45.709
With a perfect stranger.
It was...

25:45.844 --> 25:47.912
Fun to be so wicked.

25:49.849 --> 25:51.515
For god's sakes!

25:51.517 --> 25:55.452
We're talking about the death of
almost two billion people.

25:55.521 --> 25:57.254
You can't think...

25:57.323 --> 26:00.090
I know nothing
about plague science.

26:01.660 --> 26:04.595
- But you knew about
mr. Pendrick's ark project.

26:04.597 --> 26:07.798
- Yes. But I didn't know
I'd be included.

26:10.202 --> 26:13.670
- Who is lmn 899?

26:14.307 --> 26:15.739
- I don't know.

26:16.408 --> 26:17.608
That's the truth.

26:20.546 --> 26:23.279
- Lmn eight double nine.

26:23.316 --> 26:25.082
- Could it be a telephone
number?

26:25.151 --> 26:27.484
- Or a name?
- What kind of name's that?

26:27.620 --> 26:30.353
- Well, initials, sir.
First, middle and last.

26:30.389 --> 26:32.288
Uh, uh, lucy maude...

26:32.325 --> 26:33.290
Nontgomery.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.426
- And the numbers? 899?

26:36.495 --> 26:38.161
- A birth year? Month?

26:39.131 --> 26:41.164
- September '89.

26:42.435 --> 26:44.834
If that is it, well the bugger
should be easy to find.

26:44.870 --> 26:46.236
Well, get cracking, crabtree!

26:46.238 --> 26:47.638
- Just a moment.

26:48.574 --> 26:50.641
George, say it again once,
quickly.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.643
- Lmn 899.

26:56.048 --> 26:57.981
(intriguing music)

26:59.718 --> 27:00.851
Try it now.

27:00.920 --> 27:03.119
(crabtree): Lmn 8, 99.

27:04.156 --> 27:07.191
Eliminate 99. As in percent.

27:07.326 --> 27:09.193
- That's it. It's got to be.

27:09.195 --> 27:10.727
Eliminate is our man.

27:10.863 --> 27:13.063
- Yes, almost definitely,
but he'll be difficult to find.

27:13.198 --> 27:16.566
- Eliminate 99 was likely
an invitee to the pendrick ark.

27:16.602 --> 27:18.401
That should narrow the range.

27:18.437 --> 27:20.337
Look into everything
eliminate has ever written

27:20.472 --> 27:21.805
On the pendrick parlour.

27:21.940 --> 27:23.373
- I can help.

27:24.677 --> 27:27.844
- August 10, 1907.
Is this his first message?

27:28.347 --> 27:29.747
- Read it.

27:29.882 --> 27:31.815
- The problem's mathematical.

27:31.950 --> 27:34.685
All population growth
is exponential.

27:34.687 --> 27:36.820
It will double per unit time

27:36.955 --> 27:39.089
Until it encounters
a constraint.

27:39.091 --> 27:42.692
In the case of bacteria
that constraint is often

27:42.728 --> 27:44.561
The death of its host.

27:44.630 --> 27:46.363
- And I write back,

27:47.232 --> 27:49.433
"that's kind of like us.

27:49.435 --> 27:52.903
Body is to bacteria as earth
is to us.

27:52.905 --> 27:54.905
It's scale symmetry."

27:54.974 --> 27:56.573
- Scale symmetry?

27:56.642 --> 28:00.310
- Yes! I was trying to impress
him with my cleverness.

28:01.513 --> 28:02.713
- Effie!

28:03.649 --> 28:05.048
I'm sorry.
I should have called.

28:05.985 --> 28:07.451
- There's been a change
of plans?

28:08.253 --> 28:09.452
- You could say that.

28:12.725 --> 28:14.525
- Constable!

28:15.194 --> 28:16.994
Constable!

28:19.998 --> 28:22.031
You must do something
about this!

28:23.002 --> 28:24.734
- See the comet through
a telescope.

28:24.770 --> 28:27.470
59 cornwall street.
What's the problem with that?

28:27.506 --> 28:29.305
- It's my telescope.

28:29.809 --> 28:31.141
My address!

28:34.813 --> 28:36.146
- This is fascinating.

28:37.349 --> 28:39.616
Is this a reference
to the doubling penny wager?

28:40.352 --> 28:41.685
- Yes.
- The what?

28:41.820 --> 28:44.621
- It's an idea meant
to convey the concept

28:44.690 --> 28:46.689
Of exponential growth.

28:46.726 --> 28:48.425
- Would you rather have
a million dollars,

28:48.494 --> 28:50.494
Or a penny which doubles
every day for a month?

28:50.563 --> 28:52.162
- A million dollars.

28:53.031 --> 28:54.665
Surely that's--
- the same.

28:55.668 --> 28:57.100
- But a doubling penny
would take--

28:57.136 --> 28:59.436
- It takes a week to reach
a dollar.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.772
Another week takes you
to a hundred bucks.

29:01.774 --> 29:03.841
- Times a hundred each week.

29:03.843 --> 29:07.244
- So the third week would go
from a hundred to...

29:08.046 --> 29:10.613
10,000. And the fourth...

29:11.584 --> 29:12.716
A million.

29:12.785 --> 29:15.119
- 10 more days
and you've got a billion.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.521
How much longer to reach
two billion?

29:18.357 --> 29:20.190
- One more day.

29:20.325 --> 29:22.725
- Thanks to modern medicine
and agriculture

29:22.762 --> 29:24.527
We're doubling every
50 years.

29:24.563 --> 29:28.999
In a hundred years, we could
have seven billion people.

29:29.001 --> 29:32.402
- Seven billion!
That's hardly sustainable.

29:32.471 --> 29:34.904
W-we'd starve to death first.
There's your constraint.

29:36.208 --> 29:38.942
- Want to make the world livable
for another 10,000 years?

29:39.745 --> 29:41.678
Go back a few weeks.

29:41.680 --> 29:43.213
- It's logical.

29:43.348 --> 29:46.783
Completely barmy,
but logical.

29:49.822 --> 29:51.421
- All right, listen up.

29:51.423 --> 29:54.824
You're all on private property
and need to disband immediately!

29:54.860 --> 29:57.294
(indistinct chatter)
oi!

29:57.429 --> 29:59.229
Whoever's still here
in 30 seconds

29:59.265 --> 30:01.097
Will be wearing these tonight.

30:01.133 --> 30:03.366
If you'd like to live
your final moments in a cell,

30:03.435 --> 30:05.368
I'd be happy to oblige.

30:07.673 --> 30:09.172
(chuckles)

30:09.208 --> 30:11.674
(intriguing music)

30:14.647 --> 30:17.146
What on earth is that?

30:22.387 --> 30:24.188
- Yes.
This is definitely one.

30:25.657 --> 30:28.659
- There's a triggering device
set to release it at midnight.

30:29.728 --> 30:31.595
- Right after the comet
is due to set.

30:31.597 --> 30:34.131
- The two chambers allow
for the rapid compression
of contents

30:34.266 --> 30:36.399
Before it's released
as a fine aerosol.

30:37.269 --> 30:39.937
The droplet size is 20 microns.

30:39.939 --> 30:43.006
- Just one droplet inhaled
could start a pandemic.

30:43.141 --> 30:44.741
- Mm-hmm.

30:44.743 --> 30:48.011
- So the vial itself
isn't pressurized then?

30:48.080 --> 30:48.978
- Mm-hmm.

30:50.883 --> 30:52.081
- William.

30:53.319 --> 30:54.417
Please be careful!

30:55.354 --> 30:57.754
(suspenseful music)

31:02.962 --> 31:05.162
- Ga-1735.

31:05.297 --> 31:06.496
This is one of them.

31:06.632 --> 31:08.564
- We need to get it
into a kiln right away!

31:08.601 --> 31:09.900
There's one at the university.

31:10.969 --> 31:14.037
- Henry, notify every
station house.

31:14.874 --> 31:16.439
Each constable in this city

31:16.475 --> 31:18.308
Needs to be on the lookout
for these.

31:18.443 --> 31:19.709
There are seven remaining.

31:19.778 --> 31:21.645
They all need to be found
before midnight.

31:21.780 --> 31:22.446
Hurry!

31:22.581 --> 31:23.714
- Sir.

31:25.183 --> 31:27.918
(alarm beeping)

31:30.456 --> 31:33.657
(dramatic music)

31:33.792 --> 31:35.459
- The plague must have
been released.

31:35.594 --> 31:36.593
- We should hurry.

31:37.630 --> 31:39.663
- Someone at the ark
was alerted.

31:42.935 --> 31:44.767
- Give us a moment, james.

31:45.437 --> 31:46.869
- 'course.

31:50.943 --> 31:52.508
- I can't go.

31:53.812 --> 31:55.812
- I'm not leaving without you.

31:55.814 --> 31:58.748
- Julia, you have to.

31:59.818 --> 32:01.618
For susannah's sake,
you have to.

32:01.753 --> 32:03.353
(soft music)

32:12.097 --> 32:13.230
It's all right.

32:18.771 --> 32:20.103
- Who triggered the alarm?

32:20.906 --> 32:22.105
- I did.

32:22.141 --> 32:23.773
I thought a plague had been
released.

32:23.809 --> 32:25.475
- And how did you find out?

32:25.511 --> 32:27.243
- Mason bartman arrived
with information

32:27.279 --> 32:28.445
I should have received
from you.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.580
- You overstepped
your authority.

32:30.716 --> 32:32.716
- I had no knowledge
of your whereabouts.

32:32.718 --> 32:35.118
As head of logistics, it was
left to me to make the decision.

32:35.253 --> 32:37.054
- It was a rash decision.

32:37.056 --> 32:38.789
The plague has not been
released

32:38.924 --> 32:40.791
And we've identified
the culprit.

32:40.926 --> 32:42.059
- Well, who is it?

32:42.194 --> 32:44.160
- He goes by "eliminate 99."

32:44.964 --> 32:46.362
- That's not a name.

32:46.398 --> 32:48.398
- We've already discovered
one dispersal device

32:48.533 --> 32:50.600
And the entire constabulary
has been alerted.

32:50.602 --> 32:52.002
I'm confident
we'll find the others.

32:52.137 --> 32:53.203
- Hm. Indeed.

32:53.272 --> 32:54.471
And how confident are you?

32:54.606 --> 32:57.007
- More confident than
I am in you at the moment.

32:57.876 --> 32:58.841
- Very well.

32:59.611 --> 33:01.078
If that is your evaluation,

33:01.080 --> 33:02.678
Then consider
this my resignation.

33:02.715 --> 33:05.482
- Oh for god sakes! Ian!

33:05.551 --> 33:07.484
Ian, I misspoke.

33:09.388 --> 33:10.487
(sighs)

33:12.224 --> 33:13.423
It's 10:30.

33:13.459 --> 33:14.758
We have an hour and a half.

33:14.827 --> 33:16.192
Let's not waste it.

33:21.967 --> 33:23.500
(phone ringing)

33:23.569 --> 33:24.667
(henry): Sir?

33:27.039 --> 33:28.772
Somebody rented out
a cargo hold.

33:28.774 --> 33:30.507
- Of a ship?

33:30.642 --> 33:32.175
- Claimed it would be protected
from the cyanogen.

33:32.310 --> 33:34.911
- And was there a disperser
on board?

33:35.047 --> 33:36.546
- They found it
in the air intake.

33:36.582 --> 33:37.481
- Good lord.

33:38.217 --> 33:39.315
And the vial?

33:39.385 --> 33:41.851
- Ah, taken to the university
as per instruction.

33:41.920 --> 33:43.653
- Very good.
Which serial number?

33:43.689 --> 33:44.587
- Ah...

33:45.124 --> 33:47.190
Ga-1737.

33:48.660 --> 33:49.926
- Very good, henry.

33:50.062 --> 33:51.127
Um...

33:51.163 --> 33:52.395
Get back out there.

33:52.464 --> 33:53.663
- Sir.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.332
- 37...

34:00.572 --> 34:03.139

- I don't believe it.

35:35.901 --> 35:38.234
- George, you have to see this!

35:39.671 --> 35:42.505
- Adam ivy.
Password, tesla.

35:42.541 --> 35:43.840
- It's pendrick.

35:43.975 --> 35:46.376
Eliminate 99 is pendrick!

35:46.378 --> 35:47.443
- What?

35:47.445 --> 35:49.378
- I think we should start
at the beginning.

35:49.414 --> 35:50.513
(crabtree): Yes, please.

35:50.582 --> 35:52.916
- Eliminate 99's first chat
was August 7th,

35:52.985 --> 35:55.252
But I remember chats
from before,

35:55.254 --> 35:58.521
So I conducted a search
for specific words he used.

35:58.590 --> 36:00.056
- Clever idea.

36:00.125 --> 36:01.591
- And we found this name.

36:01.726 --> 36:04.594
- Before he was eliminate 99,
he was adam ivy.

36:04.663 --> 36:06.663
- Isn't that a plant?
- Yes.

36:06.798 --> 36:09.733
And mr. Pendrick had one
in his office.

36:09.735 --> 36:11.434
- And that's why you think--
- shh!

36:11.436 --> 36:13.770
- So I checked and every one
of his posts

36:13.905 --> 36:17.540
Came from inside pendrick
headquarters, executive suite.

36:17.609 --> 36:18.909
- Still.

36:19.044 --> 36:22.078
- So I was able to reverse
engineer the passcode.

36:22.214 --> 36:24.881
- And it was tesla. So?

36:24.883 --> 36:27.817
- Tesla was the name
of pendrick's dog at the time.

36:27.953 --> 36:29.152
- Coincidence?

36:29.154 --> 36:30.486
- Yes, it has to be.

36:30.556 --> 36:32.022
- What was your passcode?

36:32.157 --> 36:33.423
- Violet.

36:33.558 --> 36:34.757
- Who's violet?

36:34.793 --> 36:36.293
- She was my dog.

36:36.428 --> 36:39.496
But this is pendrick
we're talking about.

36:39.498 --> 36:42.432
I mean, he... He's trying to
save humanity, not destroy it.

36:42.567 --> 36:45.201
- Unless this is his way
of saving humanity.

36:46.405 --> 36:48.871
- This is testable.
What was pendrick's passcode?

36:51.576 --> 36:52.809
(beeping)

36:57.449 --> 36:59.081
(crabtree): My god.
It can't be.

37:01.119 --> 37:02.252
- What is this?

37:04.823 --> 37:05.788
- Where was it?

37:05.824 --> 37:07.991
- The academy theatre, sir.

37:08.060 --> 37:09.459
Take a look at this.

37:09.594 --> 37:12.128
It seems every disperser
we've found

37:12.197 --> 37:14.597
Had some connection
to halley's comet.

37:14.666 --> 37:16.299
- I suppose that's where
the crowds are.

37:17.536 --> 37:19.202
He's a little too clever
for his own good.

37:20.105 --> 37:21.204
Right, then.

37:21.339 --> 37:23.406
So, we're only looking for
things related to the comet.

37:23.541 --> 37:24.207
(murdoch): That's right.

37:24.342 --> 37:26.743
- Sirs, I've got some names.

37:26.812 --> 37:28.678
Both the cargo hold
and the observatory

37:28.813 --> 37:31.014
Were rented
by mr. L. M. Nate

37:31.149 --> 37:32.282
And hugh manetti.

37:32.417 --> 37:34.117
- Well, let's look 'em up
and bring them in.

37:34.119 --> 37:35.818
- You won't find them.

37:36.822 --> 37:39.489
If you say both names quickly
you get,

37:39.624 --> 37:41.891
"eliminate humanity."

37:43.595 --> 37:46.029
- I really want to get
this bugger.

37:46.865 --> 37:48.431
- I don't know what to say.

37:48.500 --> 37:51.500
I'm astonished you'd think me
capable of such a crime,

37:51.536 --> 37:52.836
Let alone carrying it out.

37:52.971 --> 37:54.537
- So you're not adam ivy.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.238
- No.

37:56.275 --> 37:58.942
- His posts came from
the executive portal

37:59.077 --> 38:01.177
Using your passcode.

38:01.213 --> 38:03.046
If not you, then who?

38:03.048 --> 38:06.115
- Anybody on the executive floor
had access.

38:06.151 --> 38:07.884
- Well, the critical point
is that he worked

38:07.953 --> 38:11.387
For pendrick enterprises
on or before July 1907.

38:11.523 --> 38:12.922
So who's here now
that worked for you then?

38:14.125 --> 38:15.325
- There would be several.

38:15.394 --> 38:17.160
- Mr. Vagle.

38:17.162 --> 38:19.729
- Can't be him.
He just left in high dudgeon.

38:19.864 --> 38:21.364
- Ian vagle.

38:21.499 --> 38:23.299
Initials I.V.

38:23.302 --> 38:26.168
- Right. But then adam?

38:26.204 --> 38:28.271
- We should check
his personnel file.

38:28.273 --> 38:29.372
- Right.

38:30.008 --> 38:32.342
(suspenseful music)

38:39.418 --> 38:42.017
(james): My god! It is him.

38:42.054 --> 38:44.554
- And he earned his biology
degree the same year as wiley.

38:44.556 --> 38:46.956
- It was vagle who convinced me
to invite you to the ark.

38:46.992 --> 38:49.426
- I always thought
he fancied me.

38:49.428 --> 38:51.093
- But he just left.

38:51.129 --> 38:52.995
- Well, maybe he knew
we'd be on to him.

38:58.770 --> 39:00.703
- No signal.
He's cut the lines.

39:00.739 --> 39:02.572
- We'll make the call from
humber station.

39:02.574 --> 39:04.074
- The elevator's not working.

39:04.209 --> 39:05.341
- He's shut us in!

39:05.476 --> 39:06.443
- Well, there's this ladder.

39:06.578 --> 39:08.511
- It's 600 feet straight up!

39:09.581 --> 39:10.914
- I'm claustrophobic.
I can't do it.

39:11.049 --> 39:12.047
- I can.

39:12.084 --> 39:13.382
- Excellent.
- I'll go with you.

39:19.558 --> 39:20.857
- Seven out of eight.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.592
Only one more to go.

39:22.661 --> 39:25.194
- It may as well be
a hundred if we don't find it.

39:25.263 --> 39:26.662
- So what now?

39:26.698 --> 39:28.931
We've checked every
comet-related event.

39:28.967 --> 39:30.633
- We expand our search.

39:31.203 --> 39:32.335
(sighs)

39:32.470 --> 39:34.938
Ah, if only we knew
who was behind this.

39:35.807 --> 39:36.940
- Have you talked to pendrick?

39:36.942 --> 39:38.808
- I've tried calling
but I can't get through.

39:40.011 --> 39:41.710
- If they'd found something,
they would've told us.

39:43.281 --> 39:45.614
(panting)

39:45.650 --> 39:47.116
(grunting)

39:55.594 --> 39:57.160
- Are you okay?

39:57.162 --> 39:59.162
- Um, I'm all right.
I'll be right there.

39:59.231 --> 40:00.296
- Okay.

40:00.365 --> 40:01.898
(brackenreid): Thank you.

40:03.502 --> 40:05.534
That was station house five.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.303
They've sent constables
down every street

40:07.339 --> 40:08.238
Looking for gatherings.

40:08.373 --> 40:09.505
Nothing.

40:10.842 --> 40:12.842
- I've heard the same from
station houses one and three.

40:12.911 --> 40:16.179
- Look, murdoch, the last train
to humber station

40:16.314 --> 40:17.914
Leaves in 15 minutes.

40:17.916 --> 40:19.081
Save yourself.

40:19.885 --> 40:21.317
- I'm not going anywhere, sir.

40:21.319 --> 40:23.286
- We just got a telegram from
humber station.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.187
It's a message from george.

40:25.223 --> 40:27.389
(murdoch): Culprit ian vagle.
Stop.

40:27.426 --> 40:30.393
Bought ticket to parkdale
at 10:17.

40:30.528 --> 40:33.128
Address 1201 queen street west.

40:38.536 --> 40:40.203
- Do you think he's been
here already?

40:40.338 --> 40:41.604
- Sir, look.

40:45.543 --> 40:47.477
- Clock's about
to strike midnight.

40:47.479 --> 40:48.945
- The vial's been removed.

40:50.682 --> 40:53.283
- Sirs, the landlady saw vagle
leave about a half an hour ago.

40:56.254 --> 40:58.521
(city hubbub)

40:59.624 --> 41:01.624
- Oh! Look at that.

41:02.761 --> 41:04.360
(murdoch): We pass through
the tail tonight.

41:04.396 --> 41:07.697
- With a bit of luck,
that'll kill us before
the plague gets us.

41:07.766 --> 41:09.164
- Look, it's george.

41:09.201 --> 41:11.300
- We got the first train
we could.

41:11.336 --> 41:13.169
(brackenreid): Vagle was gone
when we arrived.

41:13.238 --> 41:15.437
- He took the plague vial
with him.

41:15.474 --> 41:17.507
- I think I know where
he's gone.

41:17.509 --> 41:19.442
The roof of
pendrick enterprises.

41:19.511 --> 41:21.977
We used to have lunch there.
It's his favourite place.

41:22.013 --> 41:24.713
- Murdoch, you take
miss struthers and check it out.

41:24.749 --> 41:26.382
We'll get copies of his photos

41:26.451 --> 41:28.817
Out to all the other
station houses. Come on.

41:34.392 --> 41:35.925
(soft music)

41:38.930 --> 41:40.730
(murdoch): Hold it right there,
mr. Vagle.

41:40.732 --> 41:42.599
- Ian! Don't.

41:42.734 --> 41:44.333
- What are you doing here?
I locked you in!

41:44.369 --> 41:45.935
You shouldn't be here!

41:45.937 --> 41:48.804
- Hand me that vial
and we can all walk away.

41:48.874 --> 41:50.673
- You don't understand.

41:50.808 --> 41:52.275
We're a cancer.

41:52.410 --> 41:54.210
We'll destroy the planet
and then ourselves.

41:54.345 --> 41:55.545
It's inevitable!

41:55.547 --> 41:57.880
- It's not! Look at me.

41:57.916 --> 41:59.481
No children.

41:59.518 --> 42:01.283
Maybe that's our future.

42:02.387 --> 42:04.887
- If you release the contents
of that vial,

42:04.890 --> 42:06.355
Then it's all over.

42:06.391 --> 42:07.624
For everyone.

42:07.626 --> 42:10.559
- I can still be eve to
your adam.

42:10.595 --> 42:12.629
We can go live on
an island.

42:13.565 --> 42:15.364
- You know it's too late
for that.

42:18.236 --> 42:19.602
Stand back.

42:20.138 --> 42:21.571
(dramatic music)

42:21.640 --> 42:25.441

Not like this.

42:39.925 --> 42:41.924

The world is safe?

43:04.416 --> 43:06.416

a very different place.
