WEBVTT

00:06.800 --> 00:09.735
You got about ten seconds
to reach a point with this

00:09.770 --> 00:12.170
before this water
ends up on your head.

00:12.210 --> 00:14.371
Describe the image I just
put on the cabinet over there.

00:14.410 --> 00:17.538
And I'm not allowed to move?
You can,
but remember

00:17.580 --> 00:19.172
Mr. Enriquez specifically stated

00:19.220 --> 00:21.472
that he was walking the
punch bowl to the band shell,

00:21.520 --> 00:23.579
about to set it thereupon,
at the moment

00:23.620 --> 00:25.542
he heard the gunshots.
Also remember

00:25.590 --> 00:27.581
there was no evidence
of spilled sannga--

00:27.620 --> 00:29.759
as would happen if someone in
your position abruptly turned--

00:29.790 --> 00:31.121
found at the scene.

00:32.730 --> 00:34.595
There's no way Enriquez
saw the shooter.

00:34.630 --> 00:36.518
His statement's a lie.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.219
Think he's covering
for someone?

00:38.270 --> 00:39.828
If by "someone"
you mean "himself."

00:39.870 --> 00:42.168
In the course of your
investigation you discovered

00:42.210 --> 00:44.337
that the victim was
a wanted wildlife trafficker.

00:44.370 --> 00:45.701
Wanted, most notably,
for smuggling

00:45.740 --> 00:48.379
rare Galpagos iguanas
out of Ecuador.

00:48.410 --> 00:51.174
Mr. Enriquez
is from Ecuador.

00:51.210 --> 00:53.747
And in these photographs,
from the day of the murder,

00:53.780 --> 00:55.839
I saw multiple scars
on his arms

00:55.880 --> 00:58.849
consistent with those
of Galpagos Iguana bItes.

00:58.890 --> 01:01.779
Trust me when I say
I know of what I speak.

01:01.820 --> 01:04.721
You think this was
some kind of business dispute?

01:04.760 --> 01:06.648
I think that in light of
Mr. Enriquez's false statement

01:06.700 --> 01:07.758
he's worth a second look.

01:11.800 --> 01:14.530
A poop emoji?

01:14.570 --> 01:16.561
Oh, I thought
it was ice cream.

01:17.870 --> 01:20.077
(indistinct conversations)

01:22.210 --> 01:24.371
That's Deputy Chief Proslq,
isn't it?

01:24.410 --> 01:26.344
That's him.

01:26.380 --> 01:27.677
He's the captain's boss,
isn't he?

01:27.720 --> 01:29.608
Is there a... problem?

01:29.650 --> 01:32.210
BELL: Technically,
he's the captain's boss' boss,

01:32.260 --> 01:34.649
which means he's my
boss' boss' boss,

01:34.690 --> 01:37.454
which means I'm gonna
mind my own business.

01:37.490 --> 01:40.129
But thanks, now that I know
you think something's wrong,

01:40.160 --> 01:43.163
I'm gonna be worrying, too.
I'm gonna go spill this out.

01:43.200 --> 01:46.533
You should take down your "ice
cream" before Proslq sees it.

01:48.170 --> 01:49.762
(indistinct conversations)

01:53.840 --> 01:57.298
MAN:
No, no, no, no,
I'm not calming down!

01:57.350 --> 01:59.818
Our place is trashed!
Len, keep your voice
down. Let her talk.

02:01.280 --> 02:02.884
It's in your contract.

02:02.920 --> 02:05.616
I told you we did not need
renters, okay? We should have

02:05.650 --> 02:06.878
paid for a house sitter.
AwayKay carries insurance

02:06.920 --> 02:08.888
for just such situations.

02:08.920 --> 02:11.787
Guests we paired you with
did all this damage,

02:11.830 --> 02:14.151
so we'll cover all the costs.
Oh, really?

02:14.200 --> 02:15.656
You see this rug?
It's an antique.

02:15.700 --> 02:17.588
Are they gonna give me
50 grand for it?

02:17.630 --> 02:19.734
No, that's what I thought.
Look, I'm calling the cops,

02:19.770 --> 02:21.465
because this is v_andalism.
AwayKayIng

02:21.500 --> 02:23.730
is against the co-op charter.
They could throw us out.

02:23.770 --> 02:27.171
And you knew that?
It was 11 grand
a month, Len.

02:27.210 --> 02:28.529
Now, what the hell?

02:30.350 --> 02:32.443
What the hell is this,
a fireplace poker or something?

02:32.480 --> 02:33.879
What were they doing in here?

02:33.920 --> 02:35.808
AGENT: Wait, before you pull
that out, let me get a photo

02:35.850 --> 02:36.942
for the insurance.
That's in there pretty tight.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.288
Len, will you
stop it?

02:39.320 --> 02:40.912
You're gonna break the wall.
Now, honey,
could you get my tools?

02:40.960 --> 02:44.179
(grunting)
What is in there?

02:44.230 --> 02:46.596
WOMAN (muffled):
You're not getting that
out of the wall, so...

02:46.630 --> 02:48.188
(Len grunting)

02:48.230 --> 02:49.925
Len, stop it!

02:49.970 --> 02:52.188
Stop it, please.

02:52.240 --> 02:55.664
*

03:35.710 --> 03:37.575
WATSON: Pretty sure we
solved all those cases.

03:37.610 --> 03:40.738
You are right, we did.

03:40.780 --> 03:42.919
So, why the trip
down memory lane?

03:42.950 --> 03:45.680
Last night while I was at the
precinct I observed the captain

03:45.720 --> 03:49.383
in a closed-door meeting with
a superior officer. I could see

03:49.430 --> 03:51.386
they were reviewing
a number of closed cases.

03:51.430 --> 03:53.853
I checked the file room to see
which files had been pulled, and

03:53.900 --> 03:56.528
voil-- our cases.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.027
Or, rather, a curious
number of them.

03:59.070 --> 04:00.867
Okay.

04:00.900 --> 04:02.709
I'm attempting to determine
why they were

04:02.740 --> 04:04.002
looking at these
particular files

04:04.040 --> 04:05.769
and what they were discussing.

04:05.810 --> 04:08.438
Are we in hot water again?
Has Internal Affairs

04:10.980 --> 04:12.447
So what if they have?

04:12.480 --> 04:14.277
We've weathered
the storm before.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.481
It's not like we've
broken any rules lately.

04:16.520 --> 04:17.839
Well, any more than usual.
It's true.

04:17.890 --> 04:19.653
But wouldn't you rather know
what kind of attack

04:19.690 --> 04:21.317
we have to defend ourselves
against?

04:21.360 --> 04:22.827
It could also be nothing.

04:22.860 --> 04:24.384
How could it be nothing?

04:24.430 --> 04:26.352
Just because those
weren't in the file room

04:26.400 --> 04:29.324
doesn't mean that they're the
ones that they're looking at.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.930
And whatever it is,
the captain's got our back.

04:31.970 --> 04:34.461
So if it's something
he thinks that we need to know,

04:34.500 --> 04:35.990
he'll tell us.
I'm gonna make some breakfast.

04:36.040 --> 04:37.667
Do you want anything?
(phone rings)

04:37.710 --> 04:39.974
It's Marcus.

04:40.010 --> 04:42.342
Hello?

04:42.380 --> 04:43.972
Yes, we'll be right there.

04:44.010 --> 04:45.841
Well, at least we know we
haven't been benched just yet.

04:45.880 --> 04:48.815
Make it breakfast
to go, Watson.

04:48.850 --> 04:50.841
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

04:54.920 --> 04:56.888
Victim's name is Russell Cole.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.682
He owned this apartment.
Super found him.

04:58.730 --> 05:00.049
Mr. Cole worked

05:00.100 --> 05:03.524
for Barrett White Capital,
an investment firm.

05:03.570 --> 05:05.720
He was a quant--
quantitative analyst.

05:05.770 --> 05:07.863
Deep math guy. They use
complicated formulas

05:07.900 --> 05:09.800
to analyze companies
and then make

05:09.840 --> 05:11.967
investment
recommendations.

05:12.010 --> 05:13.932
No sign of forced entry.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.902
Looks like
there was a struggle, though.

05:15.940 --> 05:18.579
So, no one saw
or heard anything.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.578
Well, the folks next door
had some noisy AwayKayers.

05:20.620 --> 05:21.939
They'd moved on,

05:21.980 --> 05:23.845
but the other neighbors
didn't know that,

05:23.890 --> 05:26.882
so a few extra crashes
and bangs were just Ignored.

05:26.920 --> 05:28.785
Plus everyone thought
Cole was out of town.

05:28.820 --> 05:30.629
They said they hadn't
seen him in weeks.

05:30.660 --> 05:33.094
Overnight bag by the door
is full of clothes.

05:33.130 --> 05:34.950
He must have just come home.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.423
Aanay, nobody shows up
planning to commit a murder

05:37.470 --> 05:39.768
with a fireplace poker, so

05:39.800 --> 05:41.631
I'm thinking this wasn't
premeditated.

05:41.670 --> 05:43.365
Cole let the person in,
so maybe

05:43.410 --> 05:45.366
they knew each other
and for whatever reason,

05:45.410 --> 05:46.775
things turned ugly.

05:46.810 --> 05:48.471
You're incorrect.

05:49.480 --> 05:51.573
About it not being premeditated.

05:53.150 --> 05:56.984
The killer came armed with this.

05:57.020 --> 05:58.988
It's a textured grip,
so it might be hard

05:59.020 --> 06:01.887
to get prints,
but it's worth a try.

06:01.920 --> 06:03.387
Magazine isn't seated properly.

06:03.430 --> 06:05.421
That weapon
would have failed to fire.

06:07.430 --> 06:09.466
Well, how'd you know
to look under there?

06:09.500 --> 06:11.968
As you said, no one plans
to commit a murder this way,

06:12.000 --> 06:14.833
and yet the specificity of the
crime suggests it was planned.

06:14.870 --> 06:16.838
And that raises _
another possrble scenario:

06:16.870 --> 06:18.838
the killer came better armed.

06:18.870 --> 06:21.577
A fight ensued,
he or she was disarmed

06:21.610 --> 06:23.908
before grabbing the poker
to finish the job.

06:23.950 --> 06:25.406
WATSON:
What specificity?

06:25.450 --> 06:27.771
Timing of the attack.

06:27.820 --> 06:29.640
Just as Mr. Cole gets home.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.180
Plus the fact that,
by appearances,

06:31.220 --> 06:32.881
the only other thing missing

06:32.920 --> 06:35.059
is his laptop.

06:35.090 --> 06:37.957
This bag is dusty,
bleached by the sun,

06:37.990 --> 06:39.594
apart from this area here.

06:39.630 --> 06:43.498
Now, this bag comes with
a removable laptop sleeve.

06:43.530 --> 06:46.067
It sits right there.
So, if his laptop is missing,

06:46.100 --> 06:48.068
perhaps the killer has it.

06:48.100 --> 06:50.102
Well, we haven't
found it yet.
(phone dings)

06:52.780 --> 06:54.930
Captain wants me
to stop by for a word,

06:54.980 --> 06:56.902
as one does when one
wants to discuss nothing.

06:58.910 --> 07:01.219
Cole was a Wall Street analyst.
His laptop could have contained

07:01.250 --> 07:03.081
a lot of things
worth killing over--

07:03.120 --> 07:05.645
insider information,
proof of a financial crime.

07:05.690 --> 07:07.009
BELL:
Well, you go talk

07:07.060 --> 07:08.982
to the captain, we'll
go to Cole's office,

07:09.020 --> 07:11.818
see if we can find out
what he was working on.

07:11.860 --> 07:13.851
Oh, my God.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.019
This is horrible.

07:18.070 --> 07:20.038
Were you and Mr. Cole close?

07:20.070 --> 07:21.697
Oh, Russell didn't
just work for me.

07:21.740 --> 07:23.708
He was family.

07:23.740 --> 07:26.004
_He started here
right out of school.

07:26.040 --> 07:27.576
Can you think of any reason

07:27.610 --> 07:29.498
someone might have
wanted to kill him?

07:29.550 --> 07:32.917
I... I mean, people
get angry at us all the time.

07:32.950 --> 07:35.771
_ Threaten us. _
We give a company a poor rating,

07:35.820 --> 07:37.981
millions of dollars disappear.
But...

07:38.020 --> 07:39.908
nothing like this.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.019
Was there anything that Russell
was working on in particular

07:42.060 --> 07:43.880
that might have aroused threats?

07:43.930 --> 07:47.024
I'm sorry, you seem pretty sure
he was killed because of work.

07:47.060 --> 07:49.961
Is there a reason?
We think a laptop
was taken

07:50.000 --> 07:52.560
from his apartment.
Could be whatever he had on it

07:52.600 --> 07:53.931
is what the person was after.

07:53.970 --> 07:55.631
Well,
the truth is

07:55.670 --> 07:58.207
I have no idea
what he was working on.

07:58.240 --> 08:02.108
Russell specialized in tech,
medicine, I.T.,

08:02.140 --> 08:04.700
aerospace,
but as to what he was into

08:04.750 --> 08:08.140
at any given moment, I...

08:08.180 --> 08:10.148
He was my mad genius.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.954
He'd beat the bushes on his
own, look for opportunities

08:12.990 --> 08:15.288
no one else saw.
Go off somewhere private,

08:15.320 --> 08:17.959
deep dive
into a company's numbers.

08:17.990 --> 08:19.719
I gave him a long leash

08:19.760 --> 08:21.990
because he always
came back with gold.

08:22.030 --> 08:23.668
Was he on
one of these deep dives

08:23.700 --> 08:24.962
the last few weeks?

08:25.000 --> 08:26.934
His neighbors
said he hadn't been home.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.661
Any idea
where he went?

08:29.710 --> 08:31.109
No clue.

08:31.140 --> 08:34.974
Oh. My wife
is gonna be devastated.

08:35.010 --> 08:36.204
Is that her?

08:38.250 --> 08:40.969
Laurie. She won a trip
to Maui in some

08:41.020 --> 08:43.682
charity thing.
She took a girlfriend.

08:43.720 --> 08:45.642
I want to help any way I can.
What do you need?

08:45.690 --> 08:48.113
Well, we'd like
to go through Mr. Cole's office,

08:48.160 --> 08:50.822
see if can figure out what he's
been working on. We'd also

08:50.860 --> 08:53.158
like access to his e-mails
and correspondence so we could

08:53.200 --> 08:55.088
look for
any threats.
I'll walk you

08:55.130 --> 08:56.199
over there myself.

08:57.600 --> 08:59.989
(muttering)

09:00.040 --> 09:03.009
Oh, oh... come in.

09:03.040 --> 09:05.099
Sit down.

09:05.140 --> 09:06.937
Should I be concerned?

09:06.980 --> 09:10.074
Relax. I had a hunch
you picked up a vibe last night

09:10.110 --> 09:12.146
and I didn't want you
in your head about it.

09:12.180 --> 09:15.672
The meeting that you saw--
it wasn't, uh, what you think.

09:15.720 --> 09:18.609
Well, I haven't decided
what I think, but go on.

09:18.650 --> 09:21.118
Did you ever hear of,
uh, Medal Day?

09:21.160 --> 09:23.754
Mm-hmm. Annual NYPD tradition.

09:23.790 --> 09:25.929
The, uh, mayor and the police
commissioner give out medals

09:25.960 --> 09:27.598
to officers for valor,
distinguished service.

09:27.630 --> 09:28.995
Not to mention purple shields

09:29.030 --> 09:31.066
for those injured
in the line of duty.

09:31.100 --> 09:33.261
They also give out something
called a unit citation

09:33.300 --> 09:36.098
to squads that have done
exemplary work,

09:36.140 --> 09:40.099
and this year they're
giving one out to Major Case.

09:40.140 --> 09:42.074
The ceremony's in a few days.

09:42.110 --> 09:44.169
Well, that's well deserved.
Congratulations.

09:44.210 --> 09:46.178
I wasn't gonna say anything
to you and Joan

09:46.210 --> 09:48.815
because it still
might not happen, but

09:48.850 --> 09:50.841
civilian employees
are included in the award,

09:50.890 --> 09:53.779
and I want your names
on the list.

09:53.820 --> 09:56.288
It isn't money or anything,
you'd just

09:56.320 --> 09:58.129
be part of the department's
official record

09:58.160 --> 10:00.299
and you'd each
get a certificate.

10:00.330 --> 10:01.991
Something to hang
on the wall.

10:02.030 --> 10:03.622
I see.

10:03.670 --> 10:06.730
I have been getting
some resistance.

10:06.770 --> 10:08.761
I thought you should
know about it.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.372
Mrs. Barrett.
Oh.

10:16.410 --> 10:18.241
I don't mean to startle
you. I'm Joan Watson.

10:18.280 --> 10:19.872
I work with the police.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.115
I'm investigating the
murder of Russell Cole.

10:23.850 --> 10:25.818
Yes, my husband told me.

10:25.850 --> 10:29.013
Your husband has a photo
in his office of you at a luau.

10:29.060 --> 10:30.857
I noticed

10:30.890 --> 10:33.688
there was something blocking
the lens in one corner.

10:33.730 --> 10:35.698
I had an idea what it was,
so I looked into it.

10:35.730 --> 10:38.028
That picture was taken
on Russell's phone.

10:38.070 --> 10:40.732
His case was broken,
and a piece of plastic

10:40.770 --> 10:42.738
was sticking out
over the camera.

10:42.770 --> 10:45.705
Police thought it had been
damaged during the murder.

10:45.740 --> 10:48.334
But then I remembered seeing
a picture at his place

10:48.380 --> 10:50.405
with the same obstruction.

10:50.450 --> 10:53.044
So the case had been
broken for some time.

10:53.080 --> 10:55.446
Russell was the friend
you took to MaUI.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.914
You were having an affair.
And considering your husband

10:57.950 --> 10:59.918
has a memento from the trip,
I'm guessing he doesn't know.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.916
No, he-he doesn't.

11:01.960 --> 11:05.953
And I swear, I had nothing to do
with what happened to Russell.

11:05.990 --> 11:09.448
_ I'm a wreck about it.
Right now you're not a suspect.

11:09.500 --> 11:13.038
But I need some information from
you-- we're trying to find out

11:13.070 --> 11:15.038
where Russell had been staying
the last few weeks.

11:15.070 --> 11:17.834
Police checked his car
and his credit cards.

11:17.870 --> 11:19.462
They're pretty sure that
he didn't drive too far outside

11:19.510 --> 11:22.274
the city. Now, you went
all the way to Maui with him.

11:22.310 --> 11:24.847
So I thought maybe
he'd taken you to the place

11:24.880 --> 11:26.199
where he does his deep dives.

11:26.250 --> 11:28.343
He has a...

11:28.380 --> 11:32.316
a cabin near Bear Mountain.

11:32.350 --> 11:34.454
It's about
an hour upstate.

11:34.490 --> 11:36.879
(birds chirping)

11:37.890 --> 11:39.289
(car doors shut)

11:39.330 --> 11:41.423
Copious amounts
of poison iw around.

11:41.460 --> 11:42.859
Watch your step.

11:42.900 --> 11:44.788
How'd you get here
before us?

11:44.830 --> 11:47.390
You'll recall I know the owner
of a helicopter company.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.737
There was one going this way.

11:48.770 --> 11:50.067
I hitched a ride.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.328
You been inside?
No.

11:52.370 --> 11:53.974
I just got here
a short while ago.

11:54.010 --> 11:56.069
Plenty to keep me occupied
out here.

11:56.110 --> 12:00.240
So, only one vehicle has
left recent tire tracks.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.248
The tread matches that
of Russell Cole's.

12:02.280 --> 12:05.386
And, likewise, the only recent
footprints are his.

12:05.420 --> 12:07.786
So he was here, and he
didn't have any visitors.

12:07.820 --> 12:10.425
Guess he didn't like mixing
business with pleasure.

12:10.460 --> 12:14.794
I mean, besides sleeping
with the boss' wife.

12:31.310 --> 12:35.144
I'm no expert,
but this doesn't look financial.

12:35.180 --> 12:37.148
More like science.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.852
Stuff about __
masses and radii

12:39.890 --> 12:41.517
and reflection
coeffICIents.

12:41.560 --> 12:44.154
WATSON:
You're right.

12:44.190 --> 12:46.420
These are physics equations.

12:46.460 --> 12:48.052
Astronomy, to be exact.

12:54.570 --> 12:57.539
Okay, so Cole was
up here stargazing.

12:57.570 --> 12:59.561
What does any of this have
to do with Wall Street?

12:59.610 --> 13:02.306
That's difficult to say.

13:02.340 --> 13:05.047
But I do think I understand
what he was killed over.

13:05.080 --> 13:08.208
Nothing less than the fate
of life on Earth.

13:14.620 --> 13:15.882
GREGSON:
So, all these dots

13:15.920 --> 13:17.023
are asteroids?

13:17.060 --> 13:18.379
An approximation
of them, yes.

13:18.430 --> 13:20.295
Not all asteroids in existence,
of course.

13:20.330 --> 13:22.457
Obviously, there are hundreds
of millions of those.

13:22.500 --> 13:23.922
These are the 5,000 or so

13:23.970 --> 13:26.530
that NASA has deemed
potentially hazardous,

13:26.570 --> 13:28.492
those whose
orbits intersect

13:28.540 --> 13:30.508
with the Earth's
and therefore pose a threat

13:30.540 --> 13:32.303
of cataclysmic collision.

13:32.340 --> 13:33.932
Such a collision wiped out
the dinosaurs,

13:33.980 --> 13:35.504
along with most other life
at the time.

13:35.540 --> 13:39.078
Any one of these dots could
represent the next such event,

13:39.110 --> 13:41.908
which would be the last event
in human history.

13:41.950 --> 13:44.145
But there are only 5,000
of them,

13:44.190 --> 13:46.385
so that's reassuring.

13:46.420 --> 13:48.388
Emphasis
on "potentially" hazardous.

13:48.420 --> 13:50.581
But brace yourself, because
that existential knot of terror

13:50.630 --> 13:53.258
you're feeling in your stomach
is about to grow tighter.

13:53.300 --> 13:54.449
A week ago,
Cole submitted

13:54.500 --> 13:55.899
a paper to a science blog,

13:55.930 --> 13:57.625
saying that he believed
the whole way

13:57.670 --> 13:59.297
we're looking for asteroids
is wrong.

13:59.330 --> 14:02.299
"Miscalculating
Near-Earth Asteroids

14:02.340 --> 14:04.604
and the Threat
to Human Existence"?
He wrote

14:04.640 --> 14:06.972
that scientists have detected
thousands of new asteroids

14:07.010 --> 14:08.375
in the last few years.

14:08.410 --> 14:10.002
But according to him,

14:10.050 --> 14:12.644
our measurements of their sizes
are useless.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.216
And when it comes
to protecting the human race

14:14.250 --> 14:17.378
from an extinction-level impact,
obviously size matters.

14:17.420 --> 14:19.888
It's not just enough to know
that an asteroid is there.

14:19.920 --> 14:22.514
We need to know
which ones are the big ones.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.551
So that, what,
Bruce Willis can go nuke it?

14:24.590 --> 14:27.354
Surprisingly, yes.
We've been reading up

14:27.400 --> 14:29.550
on this stuff today--
there are proposals in the works

14:29.600 --> 14:31.568
to send rockets to asteroids,

14:31.600 --> 14:33.659
to nudge them
or even blow them up.

14:33.700 --> 14:35.497
So was
Cole right?

14:35.540 --> 14:37.235
Are we measuring them wrong?

14:37.270 --> 14:39.033
No idea.
Do we have

14:39.070 --> 14:40.606
any idea why a Wall Street guy

14:40.640 --> 14:42.528
was studying this stuff
in the first place?

14:42.580 --> 14:45.504
We don't.
So where does
all this put us?

14:45.550 --> 14:48.018
Sounds like you're not even sure
this is what got him killed,

14:48.050 --> 14:49.642
let alone why.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.649
The technical minutiae of the
paper are beyond my expertise.

14:52.690 --> 14:54.681
I'm at something of a loss.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.517
But...?
Well, there's an expert

14:56.560 --> 14:58.585
in the field
I consult from time to time.

14:58.630 --> 15:01.554
But doing so
is never really my first choice.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.921
Well, I'm gonna make it easy
for you. Do it.

15:03.970 --> 15:05.619
And not just to solve
this murder.

15:05.670 --> 15:08.093
If _the world is
coming to an end,

15:08.140 --> 15:10.301
I want to know about it.

15:12.610 --> 15:15.170
We scientists estimate
that our universe

15:15.210 --> 15:17.678
is 14 billion years old.

15:17.710 --> 15:19.598
Ever wonder how we know?

15:19.650 --> 15:22.175
Actually, in a number of ways.

15:22.220 --> 15:24.643
One of them is by measuring the
radiation that's left over...

15:24.690 --> 15:27.352
"Julius Kent,
'Ambassador to the Cosmos."'

15:27.390 --> 15:29.654
He's on TV all the time.
He's famous.
Yep.

15:29.690 --> 15:31.487
Celebrity astronomer.
Because apparently the world

15:31.530 --> 15:34.158
needs science explained to it
with jazz hands.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.622
We were at boarding school
together.

15:35.660 --> 15:39.221
He was every bit the blowhard
then that he is now.

15:39.270 --> 15:41.659
Ten years ago, he helped me
time a break-in to coincide

15:41.700 --> 15:43.338
with a solar flare.

15:43.370 --> 15:45.338
The radio interference
enabled me to avoid detection.

15:45.370 --> 15:47.577
It was good.
So why didn't
you want to call him?

15:47.610 --> 15:49.635
Because every time I ask
for his help, he gloats.

15:49.680 --> 15:52.171
Oh, how did that conversation
with Gregson go?

15:52.210 --> 15:54.644
Are we fired again?
The opposite, of sorts.

15:54.680 --> 15:57.740
The Major Case Squad is
receiving a commendation,

15:57.790 --> 15:59.678
and he's lobbying
to have us included.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.688
Thanks to our habit of
keeping our names out

16:01.720 --> 16:04.427
of official reports, or at
least minimizing our roles,

16:04.460 --> 16:07.054
he's having trouble convincing
the honor committee.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.125
Well, however
it goes down,

16:09.160 --> 16:11.060
it's nice that he's sticking
his neck out for us.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.624
I'd rather he didn't.

16:12.670 --> 16:15.730
I eschew such recognition,
Watson. You know that.

16:15.770 --> 16:18.307
I've reminded the captain
of such, but he's persisting.

16:18.340 --> 16:20.729
So I initiated
other steps.
"Other steps."

16:20.780 --> 16:22.736
You know what you could do?
You could just say thank you,

16:22.780 --> 16:24.407
like a normal
human being.

16:24.450 --> 16:26.247
JULIUS:
Sherlock.

16:26.280 --> 16:29.169
And this must be Joan.

16:29.220 --> 16:30.744
It's a pleasure.
Sherlock never said

16:30.790 --> 16:32.610
that you two
knew each other.

16:32.650 --> 16:33.787
Yes. I'm not surprised.

16:33.820 --> 16:35.708
My very existence seems
to embarrass him.

16:35.760 --> 16:38.320
You know, if it weren't for me,
our friend Sherlock

16:38.360 --> 16:40.123
would still think that the Sun
revolves around the Earth.

16:40.160 --> 16:41.798
(laughs)
I was eight when I
made that mistake.

16:41.830 --> 16:43.491
You chose to wear
that vest this morning.

16:43.530 --> 16:46.090
(chuckles)
It was a gift from a fan.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.495
How could I resist?

16:47.540 --> 16:48.632
With self-respect.

16:48.670 --> 16:50.661
So, Russell Cole

16:50.710 --> 16:52.530
and his Asteroid Admonition.

16:52.570 --> 16:56.131
Sherlock said that you were
already aware of his paper?

16:56.180 --> 16:57.602
It made quite a splash
in my circles.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.641
Come, I'll explain it to you.

16:59.680 --> 17:01.716
In layman's terms, of course.

17:07.790 --> 17:09.781
So, in a nutshell,

17:09.820 --> 17:14.223
asteroids are warmed by the sun.

17:14.260 --> 17:15.693
They're very hard to see
by conventional means,

17:15.730 --> 17:18.619
so instead we look
for their heat, usmg infrared.

17:18.670 --> 17:20.695
And, theoretically,
we can tell the difference

17:20.740 --> 17:23.561
between a large warm object
and a small one,

17:23.610 --> 17:25.532
i.e., the size of the asteroid.

17:25.570 --> 17:26.707
Makes sense so far.

17:26.740 --> 17:28.708
But according
to Russell Cole,

17:28.740 --> 17:30.640
this fails to take into account
what the asteroids

17:30.680 --> 17:33.444
are actually made of.
Some are mostly carbon,

17:33.480 --> 17:36.278
others more iron, many
even contain platinum and gold.

17:36.320 --> 17:40.586
Which means that some asteroids
have dull, dark surfaces

17:40.620 --> 17:42.850
and others have
light, shiny ones.

17:42.890 --> 17:44.858
And I'm sure even Sherlock
can tell us

17:44.890 --> 17:46.551
the effect that that would have.

17:46.590 --> 17:48.694
Dark surfaces get hotter
than light ones.

17:48.730 --> 17:50.789
Which,
if Cole is right,

17:50.830 --> 17:53.731
means that we've been seeing
asteroid sizes all wrong.

17:53.770 --> 17:55.738
Was he right?

17:55.770 --> 17:56.759
No one knows.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.336
Cole was a fine mathematician,

17:58.370 --> 18:00.736
but astrophysics
wasn't really his field.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.806
His paper was rife with errors
and incomplete work.

18:03.850 --> 18:06.501
It'll take the community months
to reach a consensus.

18:06.550 --> 18:08.313
I'll help, of course.

18:08.350 --> 18:09.578
The world will sleep easier.

18:09.620 --> 18:12.783
Cole mentioned in his paper that
he was working on a solution.

18:12.820 --> 18:15.857
Can you think of anyone
who would want to stop him?

18:15.890 --> 18:18.256
Well, naturally.
Anyone whose livelihood depends

18:18.290 --> 18:20.497
on the current methods
of determining asteroid size.

18:20.530 --> 18:24.261
Because of Cole's paper, NASA's
already shelved one proposal.

18:24.300 --> 18:26.768
An orbiting infrared telescope
called Piazzi.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.665
And much of the equipment
would have been bought

18:28.700 --> 18:30.509
from small private companies.

18:30.540 --> 18:32.804
Those companies have just lost
their prime source of income.

18:32.840 --> 18:35.570
Maybe someone associated
with them killed Cole in anger.

18:35.610 --> 18:37.749
So how much money
are we talking about?

18:37.780 --> 18:39.748
The total budget for Piazzi?

18:39.780 --> 18:43.511
Around $500 million.

18:43.550 --> 18:46.519
You really thought the Sun
revolved around the Earth?

18:46.550 --> 18:47.756
(phone rings)
I was eight.

18:47.790 --> 18:49.758
(chuckles)
It's Marcus.

18:49.790 --> 18:51.428
Hey. We're both here.

18:51.460 --> 18:54.190
Just got a message about a call
that came in.

18:54.230 --> 18:56.698
A waitress up in New City
recognized Cole on the news.

18:56.730 --> 18:58.527
Said he was in her diner
a bunch of times

18:58.570 --> 19:00.265
over the last few weeks.

19:00.300 --> 19:02.860
That's a long drive
from his cabin for coffee, no?

19:02.900 --> 19:04.504
It's halfway between here
and Bear Mountain.

19:04.540 --> 19:05.939
Maybe he was meeting
someone?

19:05.970 --> 19:07.506
That's as good a guess as any.

19:07.540 --> 19:08.802
All she told the detective
who talked to her

19:08.840 --> 19:11.274
was she thought
Cole behaved strangely.

19:11.310 --> 19:13.642
I figure it's worth a drive
to check it out.

19:13.680 --> 19:15.819
Watson will join
you presently.

19:15.850 --> 19:19.547
_ Just me?
A waitress who may have seen
Cole leave his cabin for meals--

19:19.590 --> 19:21.785
both of us checking that out
seems a little excessive.

19:21.820 --> 19:24.653
Thanks to Julius, we now have
a concrete theory of motive.

19:24.690 --> 19:27.727
A dozen companies lost millions
upon the death of Piazzi.

19:27.760 --> 19:29.955
One of us should stay behind
and start combing through them.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.888
_ You could work
in the car, you know.

19:31.930 --> 19:34.330
I also have an appointment
to keep here in the city.

19:34.370 --> 19:36.634
*

19:36.670 --> 19:38.467
That's him.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.478
Came in once every two
or three days,

19:40.510 --> 19:42.239
always right between lunch
and dinner.

19:42.280 --> 19:44.498
Did you ever see him meet
with anyone while he was here?

19:44.550 --> 19:46.677
He always ate alone,
didn't talk to anyone.

19:46.710 --> 19:48.314
BELL: When you called,
you mentioned some kind

19:48.350 --> 19:50.386
of strange behavior. Can
you tell us what you meant?

19:50.420 --> 19:51.944
It might be
nothing.

19:51.990 --> 19:53.651
But I saw he was murdered.

19:53.690 --> 19:55.214
And you know what the news
always says--

19:55.260 --> 19:56.818
see something, say something.

19:56.860 --> 20:00.853
He always had a laptop with him,
but he never used it in here.

20:00.900 --> 20:05.325
After he'd eat, he'd take it
out there to the parking lot.

20:05.370 --> 20:06.723
He'd do a little work on it,

20:06.770 --> 20:09.364
just standing over there,
by the wall,

20:09.400 --> 20:12.005
and then get
in his car and go.

20:12.040 --> 20:14.600
Customers work in here _
all the time. We encourage it.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.437
Why'd he need to go outside?

20:16.480 --> 20:17.902
BELL:
Maybe Cole was looking

20:17.950 --> 20:19.702
for a Wi-Fi signal.

20:19.750 --> 20:21.775
Could have been hacking
into a business,

20:21.820 --> 20:24.448
maybe one inside
this building.

20:24.490 --> 20:27.982
I don't think that's it.

20:31.330 --> 20:33.457
Is that a thumb drive?

20:33.500 --> 20:35.456
Looks like
someone drilled a hole

20:35.500 --> 20:37.889
so they could bury it
in the mortar.

20:37.930 --> 20:39.795
I think it's a dead drop.

20:39.830 --> 20:41.889
I've seen it done like this
before. It's so two parties

20:41.940 --> 20:45.034
can exchange data without
leaving a trail online.

20:45.070 --> 20:46.958
I don't think Cole was out
here looking for a signal.

20:47.010 --> 20:48.978
I think he was plugging
his laptop into that

20:49.010 --> 20:51.899
to get information
on and off of it.

20:51.950 --> 20:54.771
I think I've got
some tools in my car.

20:54.820 --> 20:56.776
HOLMES:
Thank you for seeing me.

20:56.820 --> 20:58.947
Do I address you by the full
"Deputy Chief Proslq"

20:58.990 --> 21:01.618
or just "Chief Prosky"?
(chuckles) Come on.

21:01.660 --> 21:05.482
After all Tommy Gregson has told
me about you and your partner,

21:05.530 --> 21:07.919
you can call me
anything you want.

21:07.960 --> 21:09.996
What can I do for you?

21:10.030 --> 21:11.463
Um, I'd like
to talk to you

21:11.500 --> 21:13.297
about your conversations
with Captain Gregson,

21:13.340 --> 21:14.864
and about Medal Day.

21:14.900 --> 21:17.664
Fire away.
Well, first of all,

21:17.710 --> 21:19.962
I would like to say, that, uh,
I have the greatest respect

21:20.010 --> 21:22.831
for the men and women in blue,
and commendations for service

21:22.880 --> 21:24.802
are not something
I take lightly.

21:24.850 --> 21:27.671
(chuckles)
No argument here.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.017
But, um...
(clears throat)

21:29.050 --> 21:30.984
...if you don't mind,
Mr. Holmes, uh,

21:31.020 --> 21:32.817
let me jump in here.

21:32.850 --> 21:35.648
It sounds like you
know that Tommy

21:35.690 --> 21:37.419
has put us in
a tough spot.

21:37.460 --> 21:39.678
Now, under perfect
circumstances,

21:39.730 --> 21:43.723
including you in a Unit Citation
would be, uh...

21:43.770 --> 21:44.964
Well, unorthodox.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.334
And on top of that,
you and Ms. Watson

21:49.370 --> 21:52.760
have had your share of, uh,
controversy,

21:52.810 --> 21:54.072
to say the least.

21:54.110 --> 21:55.737
The Honor Committee

21:55.780 --> 21:59.045
is not saying no, yet,

21:59.080 --> 22:00.843
but we may not be able
to square it.

22:00.880 --> 22:04.088
I think you'll be relieved
by what I have to say.

22:05.820 --> 22:08.687
Respectfully, I'd like to bow
out of consideration.

22:08.720 --> 22:10.585
I tried to persuade
the captain

22:10.630 --> 22:12.951
to rescind his request,
but, uh, to no avail.

22:12.990 --> 22:17.120
So instead, I, um, I've compiled
a list of technicalities,

22:17.160 --> 22:19.367
which, I think,
the department could invoke.

22:19.400 --> 22:20.799
Any one of them

22:20.840 --> 22:23.604
should compel the captain
to withdraw,

22:23.640 --> 22:24.959
whilst keeping me out of it,

22:25.010 --> 22:28.605
and allowing you to tell him
that you did your best.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.801
Uh, boy...

22:30.850 --> 22:33.978
You and your partner need to get
straight what it is you want.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.840
I beg your pardon?

22:35.880 --> 22:37.074
Your partner.

22:37.120 --> 22:39.145
She was all for it
when she was in here.

22:39.190 --> 22:41.681
My partner.
Yeah.

22:41.720 --> 22:44.359
Was here.
Yeah.

22:46.160 --> 22:48.993
GREGSON:
This is everything you found
on the thumb drive?

22:49.030 --> 22:52.158
WATSON:
These messages, plus multiple
drafts of Russell Cole's paper.

22:52.200 --> 22:54.498
He didn't write it by himself,
he had a partner who helped.

22:54.540 --> 22:57.168
They went over every detail
together, word by word.

22:57.200 --> 22:59.509
This partner have a name?

22:59.540 --> 23:01.474
They didn't use names
when they communicated,

23:01.510 --> 23:03.649
which makes sense, they were
already using a dead drop

23:03.680 --> 23:05.079
to keep their
partnership a secret.

23:05.110 --> 23:06.543
Here's what I don't get.

23:06.580 --> 23:08.548
You talked to someone who said

23:08.580 --> 23:10.719
that that paper was
full of sloppy work.

23:10.750 --> 23:12.012
Now, we find out
two people

23:12.050 --> 23:13.711
went over it
with a fine-tooth comb.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.557
Well, that's the thing,
it looks like

23:15.590 --> 23:17.729
all these mistakes
were deliberate.

23:17.760 --> 23:19.421
They wanted it
to take months

23:19.460 --> 23:21.724
for experts in the field
to untangle.

23:21.760 --> 23:25.560
The paper was designed to kill
the Piazzi telescope project.

23:25.600 --> 23:27.431
The one that's worth
half a billion dollars.

23:27.470 --> 23:29.461
Cole's partner
was the instigator.

23:29.500 --> 23:32.731
He promised to pay Cole big time
for publishing the paper.

23:32.770 --> 23:35.603
But check out the last
couple of messages.

23:35.640 --> 23:37.449
GREGSON:
He was upping the price.

23:37.480 --> 23:39.175
Cole wanted more money.

23:39.210 --> 23:40.848
The partner agreed
to talk about it,

23:40.880 --> 23:42.745
and told him to come back
into the city.

23:42.780 --> 23:45.578
They were gonna meet at Cole's
apartment two nights ago.

23:45.620 --> 23:47.508
GREGSON:
The night Cole
was murdered.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.118
WATSON: We've been thinking
someone who was hurt

23:49.160 --> 23:51.185
by Cole's paper
killed him in anger,

23:51.230 --> 23:53.494
but it turns out,
he may have been killed

23:53.530 --> 23:54.849
by whoever hired him
to write it.

24:02.770 --> 24:05.204
Is this how you people conduct
your business?

24:05.240 --> 24:06.867
You lie to someone who does
nothing but cooperate.

24:06.910 --> 24:09.071
Lure me here
under false pretenses.
BELL: We told you

24:09.110 --> 24:11.704
we had some questions about
the case, we're asking them.

24:11.750 --> 24:14.116
You didn't tell me
I was a suspect.

24:14.150 --> 24:16.573
I loved Russell like a brother.

24:16.620 --> 24:18.212
Why would I have killed him?

24:18.250 --> 24:19.717
The paper Cole published
was hand-crafted

24:19.750 --> 24:21.718
to kill a NASA project.

24:21.760 --> 24:23.887
It cost multiple
private companies millions.

24:23.930 --> 24:26.581
We think_it was
market manipulation.

24:26.630 --> 24:30.088
You said yourself how your
quants can destroy a company,

24:30.130 --> 24:32.894
and you were in the perfect
position to conspire with Cole.

24:32.930 --> 24:34.966
HOLMES:
Based on our research,
the likely target

24:35.000 --> 24:37.969
was a telescope manufacturer
named Cygnus Optics.

24:38.010 --> 24:39.261
Their value's plummeted

24:39.310 --> 24:41.631
as a result of the shelving

24:41.680 --> 24:44.604
of the Piazzi project, creating
an ideal investment opportunity.

24:44.650 --> 24:48.017
One that you
have taken advantage of.

24:48.050 --> 24:49.608
Knowing the company to
be fundamentally sound,

24:49.650 --> 24:51.948
you'll be confident
that its value will recover.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.958
WATSON:
Once the paper
was published,

24:53.990 --> 24:55.855
you told Cole
to lie low.

24:55.890 --> 24:57.721
You wanted him to
stay in his cabin,

24:57.760 --> 24:58.852
supposedly working
on a solution,

24:58.890 --> 25:00.255
so that he would
be unavailable

25:00.290 --> 25:02.099
to answer questions
while the damage took hold.

25:02.130 --> 25:04.291
BELL:
Then Cole
got greedy.

25:04.330 --> 25:06.025
Asked for a bigger cut.

25:06.070 --> 25:08.891
Told him to come back to his
apartment, where you killed him.

25:08.940 --> 25:10.908
You took his laptop,
so no one would find

25:10.940 --> 25:12.635
the messages
you'd been trading.

25:12.670 --> 25:14.274
And we figure you would have
picked up the thumb drive

25:14.310 --> 25:15.937
in New City eventually,
but who knows?

25:15.980 --> 25:17.743
It was well hidden.

25:17.780 --> 25:21.113
Probably, you just figured
no one would find it.

25:21.150 --> 25:23.277
You're right about one thing.

25:23.320 --> 25:24.947
I invested in Cygnus Optics.

25:24.990 --> 25:26.048
You would have, too,

25:26.090 --> 25:28.217
after the nosedive
it took.

25:28.260 --> 25:31.627
But I didn't know anything about
Russell writing a phony paper.

25:34.760 --> 25:38.093
He was killed on Monday night,
right? What time?

25:38.130 --> 25:39.961
M.E. puts it
between 7:00 and 9:00.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.558
I had a dinner.

25:41.600 --> 25:43.033
We were going over a new IPO.

25:43.070 --> 25:45.106
A dozen witnesses
can put me there.

25:45.940 --> 25:47.578
You don't believe me

25:47.610 --> 25:49.635
when I say I cared
about Russell.

25:49.680 --> 25:52.001
You think I only care
about money.

25:52.050 --> 25:54.610
So fine, let's talk about money.

25:54.650 --> 25:57.619
I told you before,
he was my golden goose.

25:57.650 --> 25:59.845
Look at my annual reports
over the last eight years.

25:59.890 --> 26:02.017
They're all on file
with the SEC.

26:02.060 --> 26:05.223
Count up how much money he
was worth to me over time.

26:05.260 --> 26:08.718
You said Russell _wanted his
partner to pay him double?

26:08.760 --> 26:13.026
I would have given him ten times
what he was asking... 20.

26:13.070 --> 26:14.867
It would have been easy.

26:14.900 --> 26:16.993
You want to arrest me? Fine.

26:17.040 --> 26:18.837
But you're gonna embarrass
yourselves.

26:18.870 --> 26:20.929
You've got the wrong guy.

26:26.410 --> 26:29.049
Cutting Cole's
boss loose?
For now.

26:29.080 --> 26:31.719
We're not liking him as
much as we did an hour ago.

26:31.750 --> 26:34.014
He gave us an alibi,
I'm gonna check it out.

26:34.060 --> 26:35.880
Are we still thinking
this is all about tanking

26:35.920 --> 26:37.626
a telescope company?

26:37.660 --> 26:39.184
Cygnus Optics is
still our best theory,

26:39.230 --> 26:41.357
but if Mitch Barrett didn't have
anything to do with it,

26:41.400 --> 26:43.220
we have to find out who else
had reason to hurt them.

26:43.260 --> 26:44.921
HOLMES:
One project's
$500 million loss

26:44.970 --> 26:46.892
could be another's gain.

26:46.930 --> 26:48.261
Now, whilst researching
the information

26:48.300 --> 26:49.938
that Julius Kent gave us,

26:49.970 --> 26:51.961
I identified somebody
who could speak to

26:52.010 --> 26:53.034
all the asteroid-hunting
projects

26:53.070 --> 26:54.776
in consideration--

26:54.810 --> 26:56.175
Congresswoman Kristen Salazar,

26:56.210 --> 26:57.973
from New York's 3lst District.

26:58.010 --> 26:59.204
She sits on the House
subcommittee

26:59.250 --> 27:01.218
for space and science funding.

27:01.250 --> 27:04.117
Turns out she's in her
Manhattan office all this week.

27:04.150 --> 27:05.640
GREGSON:
You're thinking
talk to her,

27:05.690 --> 27:07.851
see if any other
suspects jump out.

27:07.890 --> 27:09.152
When I attempted
to contact her

27:09.190 --> 27:10.157
several times earlier
in the day,

27:10.190 --> 27:11.327
my calls went unreturned.

27:11.360 --> 27:12.952
So I asked Julius
to try and leverage

27:12.990 --> 27:16.027
his celebrity, see if he
could get her attention.

27:16.060 --> 27:17.721
And she made space
in her schedule

27:17.770 --> 27:19.328
first thing tomorrow.

27:19.370 --> 27:21.031
I'm sorry to
keep you waiting.

27:21.070 --> 27:22.867
I was on a call.

27:22.900 --> 27:24.003
It's always a madhouse
around here.

27:24.040 --> 27:25.439
Of course.

27:25.470 --> 27:28.007
I see you've already met
my science advisor, Grant,

27:28.040 --> 27:30.338
which is good because
he's the expert on all this.

27:30.380 --> 27:31.301
GRANT:
Everyone, please.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.341
I'm sure you heard that
we are investigating

27:33.380 --> 27:36.747
the murder of Russell Cole?
Of course.

27:36.780 --> 27:39.044
He wrote the paper that
forced us to mothball Piazzi.

27:39.090 --> 27:41.058
It's simply tragic.

27:41.090 --> 27:42.853
And whether his assertions
turn out to be right or wrong,

27:42.890 --> 27:45.688
clearly Mr. Cole had
a singular mind.

27:45.730 --> 27:47.891
HOLMES: In ways that
you may be unaware.

27:47.930 --> 27:49.818
We've discovered evidence
that Mr. Cole

27:49.860 --> 27:52.328
undermined Piazzi...
intentionally.

27:52.370 --> 27:56.158
So we'd like to know
who profits from his actions.

27:56.200 --> 27:58.361
I don't understand.

27:58.410 --> 28:00.162
Are you saying
we were played?

28:00.210 --> 28:01.939
In so many words.

28:01.980 --> 28:04.175
The $500 million that
would have gone to Piazzi,

28:04.210 --> 28:06.804
is it going to be allocated
to a different project?

28:06.850 --> 28:08.977
No, no, the money
doesn't go anywhere,

28:09.020 --> 28:10.317
it just doesn't
get allocated.

28:10.350 --> 28:12.045
But I think you're missing
the bigger picture.

28:12.090 --> 28:15.355
That paper hurt all asteroid-
hunting projects equally.

28:15.390 --> 28:17.449
Obviously, there are
competing projects

28:17.490 --> 28:19.378
that would have loved
to cut ahead,

28:19.430 --> 28:21.091
but they all rely
on the same principles

28:21.130 --> 28:23.291
that Cole's paper
attacked.

28:23.330 --> 28:24.297
They all failed
to take into account

28:24.330 --> 28:25.467
what asteroids are made of.

28:25.500 --> 28:27.320
According to his paper,

28:27.370 --> 28:29.361
everyone is making
the same mistake,

28:29.400 --> 28:32.403
so all proposed projects are
on an indefinite hold.

28:32.440 --> 28:35.807
I mean, if what
you're saying is true,

28:35.840 --> 28:38.775
Russell Cole has done
something catastrophic.

28:38.810 --> 28:41.779
Whatever his motives,
his paper raised

28:41.820 --> 28:43.014
real, legitimate
questions.

28:43.050 --> 28:44.381
We can't un-ring
that bell now.

28:44.420 --> 28:46.945
We've gotta let
the peer review play out.

28:46.990 --> 28:49.254
And government funding
doesn't come easily,

28:49.290 --> 28:51.326
especially not
for space research.

28:51.360 --> 28:53.828
Even if the experts
decide that he was wrong,

28:53.860 --> 28:56.021
it could take_ a decade
to get aster0id research

28:56.060 --> 28:57.493
back on track.

29:05.810 --> 29:07.801
(footsteps)

29:11.580 --> 29:13.400
(sighs)

29:15.150 --> 29:17.948
Contemplating the mysteries
of the universe?

29:17.990 --> 29:19.548
Just one, actually.

29:19.590 --> 29:21.455
I've developed
a new theory of the crime,

29:21.490 --> 29:23.310
which I'm liking
more and more.

29:29.930 --> 29:31.568
Why do you smell like
a banana muffin?

29:31.600 --> 29:34.091
Oh, its a paste
of oatmeal,

29:34.140 --> 29:36.563
baking soda, banana peel,
and goldenseal root.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.067
It's a homemade
anti-itch remedy.

29:38.110 --> 29:39.862
I seem to be
developing a rash.

29:39.910 --> 29:41.878
Well, you must have touched
some poison iw

29:41.910 --> 29:42.877
when you were
up at Cole's cabin.

29:42.910 --> 29:44.309
I most certainly did not.

29:44.350 --> 29:46.045
You were walking around
outside before we arrived.

29:46.080 --> 29:47.809
I'm the foremost expert
on poisonous plants

29:47.850 --> 29:48.874
you'll likely ever meet.

29:48.920 --> 29:50.410
I did_ not touch
p0ison ivy.

29:50.450 --> 29:51.917
Proof is in the oatmeal.

29:51.950 --> 29:54.316
So what's your theory?

29:54.360 --> 29:56.248
Since leaving
Congresswoman Salazar's office,

29:56.290 --> 29:57.928
I've been thinking about
what she

29:57.960 --> 29:59.552
and Mr. Huber told us.

29:59.590 --> 30:00.955
That the effect
of Cole's paper

30:01.000 --> 30:02.558
was to delay the hunt
for asteroids

30:02.600 --> 30:05.398
for as much as a decade.

30:05.430 --> 30:08.137
I started wondering
if that was the point.

30:08.170 --> 30:10.388
So you think someone
wants us all to be killed

30:10.440 --> 30:11.600
by a giant rock?

30:11.640 --> 30:13.403
My theory is much
more out there,

30:13.440 --> 30:14.839
so to speak.

30:14.880 --> 30:17.849
I'm all ears.

30:17.880 --> 30:20.440
What if what was bad
for asteroid hunting

30:20.480 --> 30:22.948
was good for asteroid mining?

30:22.980 --> 30:25.084
Excuse me?

30:25.120 --> 30:27.850
There's gold in them
there rocks, Watson.

30:27.890 --> 30:31.189
Platinum, too. Lots of it.
Just as Julius said.

30:31.230 --> 30:32.959
Yeah, but nobody's gonna
be able to fly a ship

30:32.990 --> 30:35.629
to an asteroid until
sometime in the 20205.

30:35.660 --> 30:38.868
A crucial element to my theory.
Come on.

30:45.010 --> 30:47.604
"Michael Hines,
CEO Aurum Aeronautics.

30:47.640 --> 30:50.131
Barbara Torrissi,
CEO Exterral Dynamics."

30:50.180 --> 30:51.602
I thought everyone
was hurt equally

30:51.650 --> 30:52.947
by Cole's paper.

30:52.980 --> 30:54.868
I no longer think
that's true.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.649
Combined,
those four companies

30:56.680 --> 30:58.318
are investing billions
towards

30:58.350 --> 31:01.513
the long-term prospects
for asteroid mining.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.118
The world's governments
are also investing

31:03.160 --> 31:05.526
in missions to asteroids,
which greatly reduces

31:05.560 --> 31:08.051
the cost _
to those companies.

31:08.100 --> 31:11.194
Governments, however--
they're driven only

31:11.230 --> 31:12.959
by their fear
of asteroid impact.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.888
NASA, for example,
cares only about

31:14.940 --> 31:16.089
saving the human race,

31:16.140 --> 31:18.108
not about mining
for rare metals.

31:18.140 --> 31:21.234
And the truth is the chances
that anything really bad

31:21.280 --> 31:23.475
is going to hit us anytime soon

31:23.510 --> 31:25.444
is infinitesimal.

31:25.480 --> 31:28.608
The last extinction-level impact
was 66 million years ago.

31:28.650 --> 31:30.914
Even an event that would be
locally devastating--

31:30.950 --> 31:32.918
the loss of a city,
for example--

31:32.950 --> 31:34.918
that only comes along
every 5,000 years.

31:34.960 --> 31:37.554
Decade here or there,
meaningless.

31:37.590 --> 31:40.559
So you think experts are mapping
out asteroids too quickly.

31:40.590 --> 31:42.296
If they finish,
and it turns out

31:42.330 --> 31:44.298
the world is safe
for the foreseeable future,

31:44.330 --> 31:46.218
the governments
will cut off the funding.

31:46.270 --> 31:48.067
Which gets one or more
of these CEO's

31:48.100 --> 31:49.965
motive to slow things down.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.104
Cole's paper creates
a fog of uncertainty,

31:52.140 --> 31:54.279
humanity's fear of
the unknown is prolonged,

31:54.310 --> 31:56.574
and they get to ride
that rocket of terror

31:56.610 --> 31:58.578
to their gold mine in the slq.

31:58.610 --> 31:59.941
You're right.

31:59.980 --> 32:01.277
It's out there.
But it makes sense.

32:01.320 --> 32:02.947
As long as whoever it is
doesn't mind

32:02.980 --> 32:05.039
rolling the dice.
If we're all wiped out

32:05.090 --> 32:07.012
by an asteroid
in the next few years,

32:07.050 --> 32:08.483
they're gonna feel pretty silly.

32:08.520 --> 32:10.078
Mm. I'm certain
that they're certain

32:10.120 --> 32:11.348
the odds are in their favor.

32:11.390 --> 32:12.618
Oh, speaking
of being blindsided,

32:12.660 --> 32:14.719
I had a meeting with
Deputy Chief Proslq yesterday.

32:14.760 --> 32:16.318
Mm-hmm?

32:16.360 --> 32:18.089
You've known
about the unit citation

32:18.130 --> 32:19.620
for weeks--
why didn't you say anything?

32:19.670 --> 32:22.036
Well, because I knew
you'd be against it.

32:22.070 --> 32:24.709
So you knew I'd object...

32:24.740 --> 32:27.709
yet you conspired with the Honor
Committee's inquiry nonetheless.

32:27.740 --> 32:30.573
And this is why
I did not bring it up.

32:30.610 --> 32:32.601
I want to show you
something.

32:37.450 --> 32:38.747
I didn't conspire.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.439
The Honor Committee called
about a week ago.

32:40.490 --> 32:41.650
You weren't here._
I went to Prosky's office,

32:41.690 --> 32:43.715
answered some questions.
That's it.

32:44.760 --> 32:46.250
What's this?

32:47.630 --> 32:49.052
It's your one-year
sobriety chip.

32:49.100 --> 32:50.419
Yeah, and what's this?

32:50.460 --> 32:51.688
Also my one-year
sobriety chip.

32:51.730 --> 32:53.129
One is my first
one-year chip,

32:53.170 --> 32:54.728
the other is my
second one-year chip.

32:54.770 --> 32:57.739
So?
So they're
indistinguishable.

32:57.770 --> 33:00.000
These awards, these
ribbons, trinkets,

33:00.040 --> 33:02.679
they're-they're just symbols;
they don't matter.

33:02.710 --> 33:04.701
Not really.

33:04.750 --> 33:06.206
The work we do does.

33:06.250 --> 33:08.673
The work is all that matters.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.517
If symbols matter
so little to you,

33:10.550 --> 33:12.142
why are you so against
accepting a certificate?

33:12.190 --> 33:13.646
Captain Gregson wants to do
something nice for us.

33:13.690 --> 33:15.112
He's also our friend.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.787
I appreciate it.

33:16.820 --> 33:19.027
I'd like to let him.
So where's the harm?

33:19.060 --> 33:21.153
It's the camel's nose
in the tent, Watson.

33:21.200 --> 33:22.656
What?
It's a
slippery slope.

33:22.700 --> 33:26.067
I saw it during my time
at Scotland Yard.

33:26.100 --> 33:29.228
The reason I refused to accept
any official police credit

33:29.270 --> 33:30.794
is that once I allow it,

33:30.840 --> 33:32.808
there's no official line
as to where it stops.

33:32.840 --> 33:35.536
And then soon I begin to eclipse
the whole department.

33:35.580 --> 33:37.798
And-and resentment
and its inevitable harm

33:37.840 --> 33:40.149
to working relationships
quickly follows.

33:40.180 --> 33:43.809
So you don't want to accept
any credit

33:43.850 --> 33:45.818
because the truth is

33:45.850 --> 33:48.318
you deserve too much credit.

33:48.360 --> 33:51.557
_The work we do is too
important to jeopardize.

33:54.760 --> 33:57.399
I give up. I'm going to bed.

33:58.430 --> 34:00.193
(sighs)

34:06.740 --> 34:08.731
(groans)

34:08.780 --> 34:10.805
I assume that's not you
bringing me breakfast in bed.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.603
I thought you
might need

34:12.650 --> 34:14.277
some of my remedy--
I was wrong.

34:14.320 --> 34:17.710
So you checked me
for poison ivy in my sleep?

34:17.750 --> 34:19.786
That is not creepy.
I had no need

34:19.820 --> 34:21.788
to look anywhere
other than your arms.

34:21.820 --> 34:23.253
You appear
to have been unexposed.

34:23.290 --> 34:25.326
My own rash, however,
has spread.

34:25.360 --> 34:26.827
You still sure
you didn't touch any?

34:26.860 --> 34:28.259
Iam.

34:28.300 --> 34:29.255
Then how could you have a rash?

34:29.300 --> 34:30.449
I continued working

34:30.500 --> 34:32.263
after you went to bed
last night,

34:32.300 --> 34:34.791
poring over information on the
four asteroid mining companies.

34:34.840 --> 34:37.661
I believe I've not only
identified a suspect,

34:37.700 --> 34:39.736
but also the explanation
for my rash.

34:39.770 --> 34:41.738
I maintain I did not
come into contact

34:41.780 --> 34:43.839
with poison ivy--
but you and I

34:43.880 --> 34:47.077
have come into contact
with Russell Cole's killer.

34:54.420 --> 34:57.218
(footsteps approaching)

34:58.260 --> 34:59.727
Oh. Marcus just called.

34:59.760 --> 35:01.694
The police got permission
to go ahead.

35:01.730 --> 35:03.721
So we should
head out soon.

35:06.230 --> 35:09.267
I also heard from the
deputy chief's office.

35:09.300 --> 35:11.666
They're including us
in Medal Day.

35:14.510 --> 35:16.831
The captain is gonna go
on behalf of the squad,

35:16.880 --> 35:18.905
and then he's gonna bring
back the certificates

35:18.950 --> 35:21.771
to hand out at the station.

35:21.820 --> 35:24.618
What would you do, Watson,
if you knew the world was ending

35:24.650 --> 35:26.914
in, say, one month's time?

35:26.950 --> 35:29.282
Hmm? Indulge me.

35:29.320 --> 35:32.858
An_ asteroid 20 miles wide is
hurtling towards us as we speak.

35:32.890 --> 35:34.858
You made your point
last night, okay?

35:34.900 --> 35:37.596
We would both continue doing
our jobs to the very end.

35:37.630 --> 35:38.892
The_work we do
is important.

35:38.930 --> 35:40.818
I think I could have
done a better job

35:40.870 --> 35:43.498
explaining why
it's important.

35:43.540 --> 35:46.805
At least explaining why
it's important... to me.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.505
When you and I
first started...

35:51.550 --> 35:53.939
I quickly recognized
your merits,

35:53.980 --> 35:56.813
both as a detective
in your own right...

35:56.850 --> 36:01.458
and in that you facilitated
my own process.

36:01.490 --> 36:05.187
I'm better at the work I do
because of you.

36:06.790 --> 36:08.849
But over the years...

36:08.900 --> 36:12.825
the relative importance
of those two values has flipped.

36:12.870 --> 36:16.567
I now value the work that we do,
first and foremost,

36:16.600 --> 36:19.205
because I do it with you.

36:23.440 --> 36:25.499
So if at times _
I seem overprotective

36:25.550 --> 36:27.506
of the system that we've built,

36:27.550 --> 36:32.283
if I worry that the resentments
of others might disrupt it...

36:32.320 --> 36:34.379
I have good reason.

36:37.020 --> 36:40.854
Those chips you showed me
last night...

36:40.890 --> 36:43.290
you don't accept them
for yourself.

36:43.330 --> 36:45.890
You accept them
because you're part of a group.

36:45.930 --> 36:48.933
You accept them because...

36:48.970 --> 36:51.939
the work you did
to stand up at a meeting

36:51.970 --> 36:53.801
inspires others.

36:53.840 --> 36:56.229
It's bigger
than you.

36:56.280 --> 36:57.838
Or us.

37:00.750 --> 37:03.617
So you show up.

37:06.350 --> 37:08.250
I'm gonna go get ready.

37:11.360 --> 37:15.228
(footsteps ascending stairs)

37:20.370 --> 37:21.564
Hello?

37:21.600 --> 37:22.828
HOLMES:
Mr. Huber.

37:22.870 --> 37:24.406
Thank you for coming.

37:24.440 --> 37:26.533
Mr. Holmes,
Miss Watson.

37:26.570 --> 37:27.798
I got a call
from Julius Kent.

37:27.840 --> 37:29.034
Are you meeting him here, too?

37:29.080 --> 37:30.707
We asked Julius to
inVIte you here.

37:30.740 --> 37:32.002
We'd seen how much
influence he has,

37:32.050 --> 37:33.472
so we knew you'd come.

37:33.510 --> 37:35.046
It's so police could
search your office,

37:35.080 --> 37:37.969
with Congresswoman Salazar's
permission, of course.

37:38.020 --> 37:41.012
Why do the police
want to search my office?

37:41.050 --> 37:42.483
Why not just ask?
I'd have let them.

37:42.520 --> 37:43.851
HOLMES:
You're confident

37:43.890 --> 37:45.721
you have nothing to fear
because you think

37:45.760 --> 37:47.557
there's no evidence there of you
having murdered Russell Cole.

37:47.590 --> 37:48.727
You are wrong.

37:49.760 --> 37:52.365
You think I killed Russell Cole?

37:52.400 --> 37:53.822
We do.

37:53.870 --> 37:55.895
After the two of you
wrote that paper together.

37:55.940 --> 37:58.329
(scoffs)
That makes no sense.

37:58.370 --> 37:59.735
What possible reason
would I have

37:59.770 --> 38:02.034
to sabotage the funding
I helped get?

38:02.080 --> 38:04.002
You're referring to the
funding for asteroid hunting.

38:04.040 --> 38:05.974
As it happens, we've
shifted our focus

38:06.010 --> 38:08.069
more towards asteroid mining.

38:08.110 --> 38:10.078
While looking into the
companies involved in that,

38:10.120 --> 38:11.940
a familiar name
kept recurring.

38:11.990 --> 38:14.083
Prior to your current
job with Ms. Salazar,

38:14.120 --> 38:17.453
you were a lobbyist with
deep ties to those companies.

38:17.490 --> 38:18.787
We believe it was
in that capaCIty

38:18.830 --> 38:20.457
that you first
met Mr. Cole.

38:21.960 --> 38:23.996
He conducted an analysis
of one of your clients.

38:24.030 --> 38:25.998
His calendar showed
a number of dinner dates

38:26.030 --> 38:27.759
between the two of you.

38:27.800 --> 38:29.097
You also helped get
legislation passed

38:29.140 --> 38:32.029
giving those companies
the right to mine asteroids.

38:32.070 --> 38:33.867
And based on your
social media photos,

38:33.910 --> 38:36.037
you spend way too much money
for a public servant.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.502
Which indicates

38:37.540 --> 38:39.474
that your former employers
are paying you

38:39.510 --> 38:42.377
to make sure that government
decisions go their way.

38:42.420 --> 38:44.445
And most recently,
that included you

38:44.490 --> 38:46.378
killing Russell Cole.

38:48.390 --> 38:50.051
You people are crazy.
(chuckles)

38:50.090 --> 38:53.127
Do you have even a shred of
proof to support any of this?

38:53.160 --> 38:54.627
HOLMES:
That brings us

38:54.660 --> 38:56.389
to the search currently
underway at your office.

38:56.430 --> 38:57.954
At some point
after the crime,

38:58.000 --> 38:59.797
you brought Russell
Cole's laptop there.

38:59.830 --> 39:02.037
The case was_covered
in urushiol.

39:02.070 --> 39:05.733
It's the oil which comes
from p0ison ivy leaves.

39:05.770 --> 39:07.567
You'd be surprised at how
easily that oil transfers

39:07.610 --> 39:08.975
from one surface to another.

39:09.010 --> 39:11.137
For example, you put
the case on your couch.

39:11.180 --> 39:14.445
I sat there, and my skin
reacted to the toxins.

39:14.480 --> 39:17.074
I... I don't know what you're
talking about.

39:17.120 --> 39:19.884
I don't have poison ivy.

39:19.920 --> 39:21.114
Assuming that's true, it
is possible that you are

39:21.150 --> 39:24.586
in the 20% of people who
are not sensitive to it.

39:24.630 --> 39:26.780
Either way, police are
taking your couch to the lab

39:26.830 --> 39:28.081
to collect oil samples.

39:28.130 --> 39:29.552
They're also showing
your photograph

39:29.600 --> 39:31.659
around a diner
in New City.

39:31.700 --> 39:33.065
I think it's only
a matter of time

39:33.100 --> 39:34.089
before you're recognized.

39:34.130 --> 39:35.961
If you want to cooperate,

39:36.000 --> 39:38.059
and share the names of
the people who hired you

39:38.100 --> 39:40.136
to conspire with Cole,
now is your chance.

39:40.170 --> 39:41.728
HOLMES: _
In case you're wondering,

39:41.780 --> 39:43.805
urushiol contains DNA.

39:43.840 --> 39:46.104
So a definitive match between
the oil on your couch

39:46.150 --> 39:47.902
and the plants at Cole's cabin

39:47.950 --> 39:49.144
will be attainable.

39:49.180 --> 39:51.171
I should say,
might be.

39:51.220 --> 39:53.142
I'm not sure of the odds, but...

39:53.190 --> 39:55.055
I think they're better than
an asteroid showing up

39:55.090 --> 39:57.012
to put you out of your misery.

40:00.660 --> 40:03.493
*

40:06.630 --> 40:09.838
GREGSON:
I've been a cop
more than 30 years now.

40:09.870 --> 40:13.135
I've seen this city go through
its share of ups and down.

40:13.170 --> 40:16.776
Crime rates rise and fall.

40:16.810 --> 40:19.608
People get along or they don't.
These days,

40:19.650 --> 40:22.141
you watch the news
and it can feel like

40:22.180 --> 40:24.546
everything's falling apart.

40:24.590 --> 40:26.148
And I don't mean just here.

40:26.190 --> 40:29.682
Bad stuff happening all over--

40:29.720 --> 40:32.484
cops getting killed.

40:32.530 --> 40:34.088
Makes it tough some mornings

40:34.130 --> 40:36.223
to want to get out of bed.

40:36.260 --> 40:39.127
Not that the bad guys
will ever take a day off.

40:39.170 --> 40:40.660
Now I don't say all this

40:40.700 --> 40:42.463
to bring everybody down,

40:42.500 --> 40:45.162
I say all this because
I want you to know

40:45.210 --> 40:47.861
what gets me out of bed
in the morning.

40:47.910 --> 40:50.629
What gets me back here, at work,

40:50.680 --> 40:54.002
doing the job,
every day.

40:54.050 --> 40:55.472
* We are one...

40:55.520 --> 40:57.545
You guys do.

40:57.580 --> 40:59.013
All of you.

40:59.050 --> 41:03.749
This squad is the finest
group of men and women

41:03.790 --> 41:06.486
I've ever had the
honor to serve with.

41:06.530 --> 41:08.225
And that's not just a line.

41:08.260 --> 41:12.594
It's what our
clearance rate says.

41:12.630 --> 41:15.064
That's why it was
important for me

41:15.100 --> 41:17.489
that you all got
recognized today.

41:17.540 --> 41:19.963
Because the extraordinary work
you do,

41:20.010 --> 41:23.173
day in, day out, it...

41:23.210 --> 41:24.643
it amazes me.

41:25.710 --> 41:29.840
This team,
this family--

41:29.880 --> 41:33.247
you guys are what keep me going.

41:33.290 --> 41:36.111
So, do me a favor, would you?

41:36.160 --> 41:37.718
Give yourselves a hand?
