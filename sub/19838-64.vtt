00:01.700 --> 00:03.810
<b>This is a tomb.</b>

00:08.800 --> 00:10.480
<b>Your tomb.</b>

00:29.430 --> 00:31.250
<b><i>I am very thankful.</i></b>

00:40.100 --> 00:42.020
<b><i>Thankful for everything</i></b>

00:43.120 --> 00:45.360
<b><i>that has made our meeting possible!</i></b>

02:08.980 --> 02:14.020
<b>Zero x And x Rose</b>

03:16.530 --> 03:20.630
<b>As his time was compressed to its utmost limits,</b>

03:20.630 --> 03:25.370
<b>the King, his consciousness alone barely following 
the afterimages of Netero's movements,</b>

03:26.840 --> 03:29.680
<b>found that a single emotion reigned within him...</b>

03:37.620 --> 03:41.050
<b>Complete and utter admiration for his enemy.</b>

03:59.150 --> 04:00.010
<b><i>That's it.</i></b>

04:01.800 --> 04:06.550
<b><i>He brings his hands together to start the attack.</i></b>

04:07.090 --> 04:10.680
<b><i>That's the only motion he has 
that far surpasses my speed.</i></b>

04:14.040 --> 04:19.240
<b><i>Such wasted movement could 
cost one's life in battle,</i></b>

04:19.240 --> 04:22.700
<b><i>but now, it works as a weapon 
that may allow him to defeat me.</i></b>

04:23.420 --> 04:28.950
<b><i>Trying to guess what drove 
him to do this is pointless.</i></b>

04:29.900 --> 04:34.460
<b><i>It would have required choosing 
a path that defies reason.</i></b>

04:35.150 --> 04:40.220
<b><i>I would presume that, at one point, 
he was on the verge of madness...</i></b>

04:42.430 --> 04:45.530
<b><i>Five years... Perhaps ten years...</i></b>

04:51.390 --> 04:53.980
<b><i>And the entire time, he focused on this alone.</i></b>

05:16.800 --> 05:18.050
<b>I recognize that</b>

05:20.130 --> 05:24.640
<b>you have dedicated an incredible amount of time</b>

05:25.130 --> 05:28.350
<b>to achieve the power you have displayed.</b>

05:30.140 --> 05:33.180
<b><i>After all that, he's barely been scratched.</i></b>

05:33.180 --> 05:35.300
<b><i>Not that I expected any different.</i></b>

05:38.710 --> 05:40.170
<b>An individual</b>

05:42.310 --> 05:45.860
<b>can reach his limit after much training.</b>

05:46.490 --> 05:50.030
<b>You are a rare example of one 
who has transcended that limit.</b>

05:53.000 --> 05:54.140
<b>Bravo.</b>

05:54.840 --> 05:56.360
<b>You have earned my praise.</b>

05:58.390 --> 06:00.170
<b><i>An insect</i></b>

06:01.610 --> 06:05.590
<b><i>should not talk down to humans!</i></b>

06:22.540 --> 06:25.890
<b>The King's strategy was quite simple.</b>

06:26.670 --> 06:28.230
<b>Keep attacking.</b>

06:29.120 --> 06:34.080
<b>If the only attack capable of besting him, 
100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva,</b>

06:34.080 --> 06:38.510
<b>could do next to no damage, 
the King had no cause for fear.</b>

06:41.330 --> 06:43.530
<b><i>These are no more than dummy hands.</i></b>

06:43.940 --> 06:46.280
<b><i>They can only move in set patterns.</i></b>

06:46.950 --> 06:51.590
<b><i>If I attack from an angle that he can't 
block with a move he's already used,</i></b>

06:51.590 --> 06:54.780
<b><i>he'll have no choice but to reveal a new move.</i></b>

06:57.350 --> 07:00.450
<b><i>Once I have verified all of the combinations,</i></b>

07:00.450 --> 07:07.860
<b><i>I can find the angle of attack that will 
force him to reveal another new move.</i></b>

07:11.290 --> 07:15.100
<b><i>However, while he may have a limited 
number of attack patterns,</i></b>

07:15.100 --> 07:20.120
<b><i>the number of combinations they can 
be used in may as well be infinite.</i></b>

07:24.210 --> 07:28.380
<b><i>But every individual has a rhythm.</i></b>

07:29.100 --> 07:32.780
<b><i>There will be an unconscious bias for, 
and against, certain patterns,</i></b>

07:33.200 --> 07:36.620
<b><i>and that bias naturally shapes one's identity.</i></b>

07:37.480 --> 07:40.320
<b><i>If I can identify his personal rhythm,</i></b>

07:40.320 --> 07:46.650
<b><i>I have a fair chance of guessing 
which patterns he will select.</i></b>

07:47.590 --> 07:52.400
<b><i>To find the single correct needle 
among countless millions,</i></b>

07:52.400 --> 07:55.270
<b><i>and thread it accurately...</i></b>

07:56.840 --> 07:59.560
<b><i>is what it will take to pierce my target.</i></b>

07:59.560 --> 08:01.780
<b><i>It may prove difficult...</i></b>

08:05.420 --> 08:06.920
<b><i>But I will succeed.</i></b>

08:08.240 --> 08:09.700
<b><i>I can accomplish it!</i></b>

08:10.930 --> 08:13.790
<b><i>Old soldier, I beg of you...</i></b>

08:14.910 --> 08:19.230
<b><i>Don't lose your life before I succeed!</i></b>

08:22.920 --> 08:24.690
<b><i>He's laughing?</i></b>

08:25.120 --> 08:28.820
<b><i>Well, I'm also enjoying myself, so I can't blame him.</i></b>

08:29.840 --> 08:32.530
<b><i>No matter my attack trajectory,</i></b>

08:33.070 --> 08:37.800
<b><i>he recovers immediately and moves to counter.</i></b>

08:38.680 --> 08:45.250
<b><i>If I make a wrong move, his speed won't 
allow me time to unleash the next Hand.</i></b>

08:46.570 --> 08:53.010
<b><i>If I lose focus, he'll tear me 
apart before I realize it.</i></b>

08:54.990 --> 09:00.390
<b><i>This is a contest of endurance, in which 
I must keep choosing correctly...</i></b>

09:01.180 --> 09:05.470
<b><i>When I fail, you win.</i></b>

09:08.290 --> 09:12.480
<b><i>That's probably what you're thinking, Ant King!</i></b>

09:12.980 --> 09:14.160
<b><i>No matter.</i></b>

09:14.160 --> 09:16.010
<b><i>I shall checkmate you shortly.</i></b>

09:17.220 --> 09:20.160
<b><i>Checkmate me if you can.</i></b>

09:21.130 --> 09:24.240
<b><i>I'll show you my Zero Hand!</i></b>

09:52.320 --> 09:55.280
<b>After hundreds and thousands of hits,</b>

09:55.710 --> 10:01.330
<b>the King was beginning to feel the slightest 
hints of dull pain within his body.</b>

10:02.580 --> 10:03.470
<b>However...</b>

10:17.260 --> 10:18.570
<b>Stop the bleeding.</b>

10:19.280 --> 10:21.260
<b>Then tell me my name.</b>

10:21.910 --> 10:25.920
<b>You have done well for a human.</b>

10:35.960 --> 10:36.900
<b>What's wrong?</b>

10:37.330 --> 10:40.030
<b>If you don't act, you'll die of blood loss.</b>

10:42.180 --> 10:43.530
<b>Don't make me laugh.</b>

10:54.920 --> 10:57.050
<b>I'll die?</b>

10:57.580 --> 11:00.640
<b>You shouldn't get cocky after 
landing a lucky punch...</b>

11:00.640 --> 11:02.300
<b>The battle's just begun!</b>

11:03.520 --> 11:06.030
<b>You have truly earned my admiration.</b>

11:06.530 --> 11:10.060
<b>I am amazed that your spirit has not flagged.</b>

11:10.970 --> 11:15.290
<b>However, losing your leg was basically inevitable.</b>

11:15.720 --> 11:20.570
<b>It is the consequence of using a defense that, 
while not bad, was not the best choice.</b>

11:22.650 --> 11:27.640
<b>After playing against Komugi, I learned 
the art of anticipating enemy actions.</b>

11:29.080 --> 11:33.960
<b>Your unconscious bias against certain patterns</b>

11:33.960 --> 11:38.090
<b>gives me insight into the otherwise 
limitless options you have.</b>

11:41.250 --> 11:44.280
<b>Next, I'll take your left arm.</b>

11:50.590 --> 11:52.350
<b>The ensuing fight</b>

11:52.750 --> 11:55.860
<b>did not even last a minute.</b>

11:58.860 --> 11:59.860
<b><i>This is</i></b>

12:01.190 --> 12:03.060
<b><i>my life's final act!</i></b>

12:04.160 --> 12:07.280
<b>As he released his 100-Type, Netero's resolve</b>

12:07.800 --> 12:11.990
<b>heightened his physical and mental senses,</b>

12:16.010 --> 12:19.170
<b>resulting in an exchange of more 
than a thousand punches,</b>

12:21.410 --> 12:25.270
<b>and sparking countless fireworks 
between the combatants.</b>

12:28.000 --> 12:32.350
<b>And then, the moment arrived.</b>

12:34.560 --> 12:37.220
<b>His attacks began to show a slight inclination,</b>

12:37.600 --> 12:42.860
<b>one not quite significant enough 
to be called a habit or bias.</b>

12:43.750 --> 12:48.490
<b>After using his body to bear the 
brunt of Netero's attacks,</b>

12:48.490 --> 12:53.090
<b>the King was able to find 
the faint light beyond, and...</b>

12:55.120 --> 12:56.550
<b>he reached it.</b>

13:13.130 --> 13:16.400
<b>Are you satisfied now?</b>

13:18.880 --> 13:22.320
<b>Then tell me my name.</b>

13:31.650 --> 13:33.000
<b>Ant King...</b>

13:35.110 --> 13:38.250
<b>You believe I cannot pray with a single arm?</b>

13:41.380 --> 13:45.010
<b><i>A prayer comes from the heart.</i></b>

13:53.510 --> 13:57.370
<b><i>If the heart achieves the correct 
form, it becomes emotion...</i></b>

13:57.370 --> 13:59.940
<b><i>And emotions may be manifested.</i></b>

14:04.460 --> 14:07.290
<b>100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva Zero Hand</b>

14:07.290 --> 14:10.150
<b>was a Buddha that appeared behind an enemy,</b>

14:12.480 --> 14:19.020
<b>gently enveloping the target 
with an indiscriminate love.</b>

14:27.050 --> 14:31.560
<b>Previously, Killua had sensed its murderous 
intent from a great distance away.</b>

14:31.950 --> 14:33.310
<b><i>Not this way!</i></b>

14:34.630 --> 14:39.750
<b>It had left such a strong impact, 
Killua had changed his direction.</b>

14:41.220 --> 14:44.150
<b>The entirety of Netero's aura</b>

14:45.690 --> 14:50.480
<b>was transformed into a light as 
blinding as a star, and fired</b>

14:52.410 --> 14:54.160
<b>with a merciless roar.</b>

16:29.830 --> 16:32.860
<b>The pinnacle of individual strength.</b>

16:51.500 --> 16:53.980
<b>That was a magnificent attack.</b>

16:55.340 --> 16:57.560
<b><i>Zero wasn't enough?</i></b>

17:00.060 --> 17:02.750
<b>I was born to be King of the Ants,</b>

17:03.240 --> 17:06.330
<b>to rule over all organisms.</b>

17:08.270 --> 17:12.670
<b>I represent the instinctive hope 
long nurtured by my species,</b>

17:12.670 --> 17:15.820
<b>and that species continues to evolve for my sake.</b>

17:17.070 --> 17:22.790
<b>I stand here now, the resulting boon 
of the total support of my species.</b>

17:24.680 --> 17:28.130
<b>You are an individual human, not a king...</b>

17:28.530 --> 17:32.010
<b>I am the King that bears his kind's fate.</b>

17:33.030 --> 17:35.700
<b>That was the difference in this battle.</b>

17:36.950 --> 17:44.570
<b>The Chimera Ants' long evolution 
has culminated in me.</b>

17:46.080 --> 17:51.710
<b>This is a feat the human race, with its 
individuality, can never match.</b>

17:52.310 --> 17:56.870
<b>However, humans will no longer 
be used to propagate our species.</b>

17:57.870 --> 17:59.940
<b>We have learned that</b>

17:59.940 --> 18:04.220
<b>the strong human ego disrupts 
the bonds between Ants.</b>

18:05.440 --> 18:07.230
<b>Out of respect for your efforts,</b>

18:07.760 --> 18:11.740
<b>I shall allow humans to permanently 
survive within a special zone.</b>

18:12.510 --> 18:18.240
<b>We shall reevaluate the number and 
quality of humans to be used as food.</b>

18:20.420 --> 18:25.000
<b>Your lonely battle was not in vain...</b>

18:30.770 --> 18:34.400
<b>I shall not repeat myself again.</b>

18:35.640 --> 18:37.260
<b>Tell me my name.</b>

18:52.580 --> 18:57.330
<b>I am not alone.</b>

19:06.380 --> 19:10.540
<b>Don't underestimate the human race, Meruem.</b>

19:12.120 --> 19:15.780
<b>Meruem... That is your name.</b>

19:20.020 --> 19:23.370
<b>As Netero spoke the King's name,</b>

19:24.140 --> 19:27.660
<b>the King had no time to consider it,</b>

19:27.660 --> 19:31.090
<b>as he watched the old man who was 
supposed to be surrendering.</b>

19:32.280 --> 19:34.790
<b><i>What is this?</i></b>

19:45.280 --> 19:47.520
<b>Meruem, King of Ants,</b>

19:48.290 --> 19:51.080
<b>you understand nothing...</b>

19:58.990 --> 20:03.340
<b>of humanity's infinite potential for evolution!</b>

20:04.920 --> 20:09.790
<b>It was the first time the King had felt fear.</b>

20:10.680 --> 20:16.230
<b>One look at the face of this beaten old man, 
who should have been waiting for death,</b>

20:16.860 --> 20:24.280
<b>made it clear that his seemingly 
vain words were no mere boast.</b>

20:35.620 --> 20:40.380
<b><i>Should your heart stop beating, this will activate.</i></b>

20:48.300 --> 20:52.140
<b>If there is a hell, I'll see you there.</b>

20:56.430 --> 20:57.690
<b><i>I see now...</i></b>

20:58.800 --> 21:00.650
<b><i>Yes... I see...</i></b>

21:03.970 --> 21:05.830
<b><i>You had me in checkmate</i></b>

21:07.180 --> 21:08.480
<b><i>from the start...</i></b>

21:28.850 --> 21:33.180
<b>The bomb was both low-budget and compact,</b>

21:33.180 --> 21:36.290
<b>while also proving surprisingly lethal.</b>

21:37.570 --> 21:40.020
<b>With the right technology,</b>

21:40.530 --> 21:44.010
<b>it was possible to quickly mass 
produce these bombs.</b>

21:44.800 --> 21:47.450
<b>Due to the shape of the smoke cloud,</b>

21:49.280 --> 21:53.600
<b>it was called the Miniature Rose, 
or the poor man's rose,</b>

21:53.600 --> 21:56.350
<b>and was popular with small dictatorships.</b>

23:24.670 --> 23:27.170
<b>Next time: Hostility x And x Determination.</b>

23:27.170 --> 23:29.790
<b>No matter what happens, 
I won't betray my friends.</b>

23:29.790 --> 23:32.250
<b>No matter what happens, 
I'll believe in my friends.</b>

23:32.750 --> 23:35.630
<b>Thank you, Chairman Netero.</b>
