who are a lot braver
than I am,

40:29.510 --> 40:31.888
and they don't get medals
for it.

40:31.888 --> 40:33.681
So I accept this award

40:33.681 --> 40:37.769
on behalf
of all the heroes here today,

40:37.769 --> 40:40.313
and I thank God that I have
been given the privilege

40:40.313 --> 40:43.691
to serve our community
and our country.

You know...

40:46.736 --> 40:48.613
wearing this uniform,

40:48.613 --> 40:50.615
it isn't just an honor...

40:50.615 --> 40:52.533
this is my life...

40:52.533 --> 40:54.160
my calling.

40:56.746 --> 40:57.872
It's my destiny.
