If this is the ghost
of Aunt Trudy, I'm sorry,

01:28.630 --> 01:31.383
but how was I supposed to know
that you couldn't swim?

01:31.466 --> 01:33.343

and then they did stuff to me,

01:55.198 --> 01:56.909
and some of it tickled, [giggles]

01:56.992 --> 01:59.078

-[panting]
-Argh!

02:01.288 --> 02:04.124
Really, Mort? Aliens?
Okay, little fella, out!

02:04.207 --> 02:06.501
What Clover's saying is,
why would they abduct you

02:06.585 --> 02:08.837
when there's a perfectly good king
to abduct?

02:08.921 --> 02:12.925
Don't they realize how great it would be
to be intergalactic homies with me?

02:13.008 --> 02:14.718
Yeah, that is not what I was saying.

02:14.802 --> 02:18.263
I-I think everyone's point is,
there must be a logical explanation

02:18.346 --> 02:22.350
for what happened to Mort last night.
He had a bad dream, he sleepwalked--

02:22.434 --> 02:25.687
The aliens had some paperwork mix-up
and tried to give Mort

02:25.771 --> 02:28.356
their advanced space technology
instead of the king.

02:28.440 --> 02:31.944
You know, I'm all about them lasers, dawg.
[mimicking lasers firing]

02:32.027 --> 02:33.487
[shouts] There are no aliens,

-[sniffs]
-Ahem.

02:37.783 --> 02:39.952
Terribly sorry. [chuckles nervously]

02:40.077 --> 02:43.080
That came out a bit louder
than I intended it to.

02:43.163 --> 02:46.374
Clover is correct.
Unlike the Sky Gods and sea monsters

02:46.458 --> 02:49.920
and psychically moving things
with your mind, aliens are make-believe.

02:50.004 --> 02:53.674
If I didn't get abducted,
then where did I get this?

02:54.800 --> 02:55.717
[all gasping]

02:56.301 --> 03:00.597
Uh, Mort, [clears throat]
did, uh, did you shave your butt again?

03:00.681 --> 03:03.391
The aliens did it! This time.

03:03.475 --> 03:05.310
Whoa-ho ho ho ho!

03:05.393 --> 03:07.479
Killer manscaping, Mort.

03:07.729 --> 03:12.151
Way to keep your grooming game tight.
Wow, you could eat off that thing.

03:12.233 --> 03:13.777
This confirms nothing.

03:13.861 --> 03:16.905
Masikura, look into Mort's brainy parts

03:16.989 --> 03:19.324
-with your psychic lizard voodoo.
-Well, I don't--

03:19.407 --> 03:21.618
[both babbling together]

03:21.702 --> 03:25.246
What is it? What is it? Come on!
Come on, come on, come on!

Oh, I gotta see this. [mumbling]

03:49.229 --> 03:51.023
Hey, that tickles.

03:51.606 --> 03:55.318
Wait, I didn't say stop. Get back to work!

03:59.239 --> 04:01.449
[groans] Your Majesty, are you all right?

04:01.533 --> 04:05.037
[slowly] That was so messed up.

04:05.412 --> 04:08.874
That something so cool
happened to Mort instead of me!

04:08.957 --> 04:12.086
Oh, there's so much great stuff
on that spaceship, you guys.

04:12.169 --> 04:14.462
Alien technology that'll
completely revolutionize

04:14.546 --> 04:17.382
the electronic dance music scene
around here.

04:17.465 --> 04:19.218
It's like some next level...

04:19.300 --> 04:24.723
-[techno music playing]
-[Julien beatboxing]

04:24.890 --> 04:26.641
So, I'm getting light headed.

04:26.725 --> 04:30.395
So, your reason for making alien contact
is for better techno music?

04:30.478 --> 04:31.730
Well, yeah.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.108
And maybe meet a cool alien best friend

04:34.191 --> 04:38.695
to eat candy with or go cruising around
in a tripped out space hooptie.

04:38.779 --> 04:39.780
[chuckles]

04:39.863 --> 04:41.489
Clover, let's make this happen!

04:41.573 --> 04:43.366
I'll stake out Mort's stump tonight.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.451
Oh, no, no no.

04:44.534 --> 04:47.871
I don't want Johnny Law
poking around in my pad.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.915
And I will stake out the stump as well.

04:49.998 --> 04:51.625
Ooh, I'll make hummus.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.797
If the aliens come, let me do the talking.

04:56.880 --> 05:00.134
I'll simply explain to them
that they're focusing on the wrong lemur

05:00.217 --> 05:04.429
when the perfect abductee has been
right in front of them the whole time.

05:04.512 --> 05:05.513
[shouts] Now, hide!

05:12.854 --> 05:13.688
Guys?

05:14.273 --> 05:16.108
[sighs] Yes, Mort?

05:16.191 --> 05:18.110
I'm too excited to sleep.

05:18.359 --> 05:20.028
Then pretend to sleep.

05:20.154 --> 05:21.404
Okay.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.659
Oh, I'm too excited to pretend to sleep!

05:25.742 --> 05:26.743
Go to sleep!

05:27.995 --> 05:30.455
-Clover, are you hurt?
-That wasn't me.

05:30.538 --> 05:32.207
[continues screaming]

05:32.291 --> 05:36.128
Oh, yeah, aliens!
Show the king your space goodies!

05:36.711 --> 05:38.922
When I get on that ship, I got shotgun.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.882
No takey-backsies.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.383
[whimpering]

05:43.844 --> 05:44.761

Whoa!

05:46.888 --> 05:49.224
-[humming a tune]
-Argh!

05:51.434 --> 05:52.519
Mort's been taken.

05:53.478 --> 05:54.646
Again?

05:54.729 --> 05:56.273
[screams]

05:56.355 --> 05:57.274
I mean, just... [screams]

05:57.356 --> 05:58.733
Are you hurt, King Julien?

05:58.817 --> 06:01.111
Well, I kinda slept on my neck
funny the other night,

06:01.195 --> 06:04.156
and now there's a pinchy feeling,
when I turn my head like th--

06:04.239 --> 06:05.364
-[snapping]
-Ow! See?

06:05.448 --> 06:08.827
Okay, that's a no.
Maurice, situation report.

06:09.119 --> 06:09.995
Maurice?

06:10.078 --> 06:12.706
[Maurice continues whimpering]

06:12.789 --> 06:14.833
What we saw in there is not normal.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.168
We have to warn the village.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.545
Sorry, Mo-Mo,
but we're on information lockdown.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.172
Nobody finds out about this.

06:20.255 --> 06:22.757
The citizens deserve transparency,
Your Majesty.

06:22.841 --> 06:24.843
Well, I, uh...

06:24.926 --> 06:26.094
They deserve to know the truth.

06:26.178 --> 06:28.055
Oh, right. Of course they do,

06:28.138 --> 06:30.098
but you know how citizens are.

06:30.182 --> 06:33.643
They're much happier
when they're a bunch of clueless goobers.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.188
So true! Take me for example.

06:36.271 --> 06:39.398
Trapped in the ivory tower
of my superior intellect,

06:39.482 --> 06:43.778
I find myself racked with loneliness,
neuroses, regret and...

06:43.862 --> 06:46.948
Wow, I'm over-sharing, aren't I?
[chuckles, snorts]

06:47.032 --> 06:48.616
Exactly. What he said.

06:48.700 --> 06:51.203
Nothing good can ever come
from being honest with the public.

06:51.286 --> 06:53.830
[stammering, grumbling]

06:53.914 --> 06:59.586
And the award for Biggest Drama Queen
in a Supporting Role goes to Maurice!

06:59.753 --> 07:00.795
Yeesh!

07:01.129 --> 07:04.423
Timo, let's use your science magic
to contact the aliens.

07:04.507 --> 07:05.342
-Um, King Julien?
-Clover, you--

07:05.424 --> 07:07.135
Not now, Masikura, I'm on a roll.

07:07.219 --> 07:09.596
Clover, you're in charge
of defending the royal secrets

07:09.679 --> 07:11.556
from the haters,
both foreign and domestic.

07:11.639 --> 07:14.017
-On it!
-What should I do, King Julien?

07:14.101 --> 07:15.977
Not now, Mort... Mort?

07:16.061 --> 07:18.646
-[Clover] How did you escape?
-[Julien] And what's on your ear?

07:18.730 --> 07:21.775
I don't know.
I think the aliens gave it to me.

07:21.858 --> 07:25.820
The blinking light's a little tacky,
right? But I didn't get a gift receipt.

07:25.904 --> 07:27.948
Aliens are accessorizing you?

07:28.031 --> 07:31.326
Mort, where did your magical medallion
really come from?

07:31.410 --> 07:34.371
This isn't magic at all.
This is technology.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.581
I might be able to patch into this.

07:36.664 --> 07:40.043
Do your thing, Timo. I don't want Mort
to be the only one with space bling.

07:40.127 --> 07:40.961
[humming]

07:41.044 --> 07:43.046
And now, it's becoming a full on cover-up.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.966
I'm loyal to King Julien,
but this feels dangerous.

07:46.091 --> 07:47.342
We gotta warn everybody.

07:47.426 --> 07:51.054
Wow, this is great.
A hard-hitting news story.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.722
I put it on my vision board,

07:52.806 --> 07:55.100
and boom, the universe hooks me up.

07:55.183 --> 07:58.145
Ooh, I can't wait to ask the aliens
who they're wearing.

07:58.228 --> 08:01.689
Just remember, I could never
publicly go against King Julien's wishes.

08:01.773 --> 08:05.110
I completely understand.

08:05.444 --> 08:09.281
I'm here with the anonymous
best friend of King Julien,

08:09.364 --> 08:12.159
who's ready to blow
the doors off a conspiracy.

08:12.242 --> 08:16.496
[Maurice in distorted voice] Thanks
for having me, Xixi. Pleasure to be here.

08:16.579 --> 08:18.790
That's definitely Maurice, right?

08:18.873 --> 08:21.460
I mean, his body, mannerisms, voice,

08:21.542 --> 08:23.920
posture and ear shape sure ring a bell.

08:24.004 --> 08:27.841
But, heck, I can't see his face,
so, [chuckles] who knows?

08:27.924 --> 08:31.052
I have reason to believe
lemurs from our kingdom

08:31.136 --> 08:33.554
are being abducted by aliens.

08:33.638 --> 08:36.057
-[all chattering indistinctly]
-They're back?

08:37.434 --> 08:41.062
What can we do to stay safe
against this alien invasion,

08:41.146 --> 08:43.564
lemur-who-definitely-isn't-Maurice?

08:43.648 --> 08:46.360
The most important thing
is to remain calm.

08:46.443 --> 08:49.196
If we build fortified bunkers
and collect enough supplies

08:49.279 --> 08:50.947
to live underground forever,

08:51.031 --> 08:54.034
we can get back to our normal lives.

08:54.117 --> 08:56.453
Um, that's it? Sounds easy enough.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.079
[all chattering]

08:58.163 --> 09:00.165
[grunts, panting]

09:00.248 --> 09:02.459
Now what's all this mess about aliens?

09:02.542 --> 09:05.212
What? That wasn't me on the stage.

09:05.295 --> 09:09.007
[stammering] I mean, I don't even know
what you're talking about. [grunts]

09:09.508 --> 09:11.676
-Okay, fine. It was me.
-Hah!

09:12.511 --> 09:13.887
I was just a boy.

09:13.970 --> 09:17.182
I watched her get pulled
into a bright light.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.100
Save yourself, Hector.

09:19.184 --> 09:21.395
[shouts] Mommy!

09:21.686 --> 09:25.982
And that was the last time
I ever saw my mom.

09:26.233 --> 09:29.694
If the aliens are really back,
maybe I can finally get some answers

09:29.777 --> 09:30.987
about what happened to her.

09:31.071 --> 09:34.115
Actually, I could really use your help
hiding the villagers.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.243
Hiding? [laughs]

09:36.326 --> 09:38.453
You can't hide from these things.

09:38.537 --> 09:40.080
You can't run from them.

09:40.163 --> 09:43.917
If they want to get you,
[shouts] they will!

09:44.000 --> 09:45.919
[whimpering]

09:46.794 --> 09:49.964
This is crazy! I'm coming with you,
and that is final.

09:50.048 --> 09:52.675
If the aliens give me a plus-one, sure.

09:52.759 --> 09:55.929
Just, when we're on the ship,
don't be a total buzzkill.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.723
We're not here to make friends
with these Martian invaders.

09:58.806 --> 10:00.183
They're the enemy, Your Majesty!

10:00.267 --> 10:02.269
See that? Buzzkill. Now hide!

10:02.643 --> 10:03.644
-[Clover grunts]

10:05.646 --> 10:07.982
Ow! [groaning]

10:08.066 --> 10:09.276
[crashing]

10:09.650 --> 10:11.319
Okay, good night.

10:11.403 --> 10:15.823
I-I mean, [squeaky voice] g-good night!
I'm gonna do the sleepies now.

10:18.785 --> 10:19.619
[sighs]

10:20.412 --> 10:21.246
[groans]

10:21.329 --> 10:22.830
[squeaky voice] Ooh! I'm Mort.

10:22.914 --> 10:27.001
I hope the aliens don't take me
up to their spaceship.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.504
'Cause, I'm Mort.

10:29.588 --> 10:32.257
Yep, I'm definitely Mort. [giggles]

10:34.426 --> 10:36.511
[giggling in pleasure]

10:36.595 --> 10:39.180
Ah, so luxurious.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.183
Yay!

10:43.768 --> 10:46.271
Ooh! Boxers and briefs?

10:46.354 --> 10:48.731
My King Julien is full of surprises.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.025
Whee!

10:51.443 --> 10:52.527
[giggling]

10:52.611 --> 10:54.488
[gasps, screams]

10:54.571 --> 10:56.948
[Julien] I can't believe
the aliens took Mort!

10:57.031 --> 10:59.075
Again! So unfair!

10:59.200 --> 11:01.578
[stammers] I think I've patched
into Mort's tracking tag.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.163
This should be a live feed.

11:03.246 --> 11:05.165
[Mort yelling indistinctly]

11:05.248 --> 11:08.293
Nope, don't need to hear any more of that.
Can you locate him, Timo?

11:08.376 --> 11:11.838
He's being held somewhere in here.

11:11.921 --> 11:15.091
Which explains how the aliens
found him in King Julien's hut.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.051
"Alleged aliens."

11:17.135 --> 11:19.137
I say we locate where they're holding Mort

11:19.220 --> 11:22.681
and we bust in there and end each
and every one of them with our bare hands.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.058
[Timo] Too dangerous.

11:24.142 --> 11:27.354
I suggest sending
the superstitious lizard in first.

11:27.437 --> 11:30.064
[groans] You're right.
That was over the line.

11:30.148 --> 11:34.402
Anyhoo, Masikura goes in,
gets the lay of the land and locates Mort.

11:34.486 --> 11:37.989
Then, Clover enters silently
for the extraction.

11:38.072 --> 11:43.077
Yes! And I make a great
first impression with the aliens. [kisses]

11:43.161 --> 11:47.915
Charming, without being too try-hard
or eager, you know. Smooth.

11:47.999 --> 11:49.000
Wa-cha!

11:49.083 --> 11:51.378
Which is why I need
some face time with them.

11:51.461 --> 11:54.297
-Okay, peoples, we got a real mission now.
-[cracking]

11:54.381 --> 11:57.050
Masikura, you're the master of disguise.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.677
Clover, the muscle.

11:58.759 --> 12:02.889
And I'll be the brains, the ladies' man,
the wild card, the comic relief.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.307
[Timo blows raspberry, laughs]

12:04.391 --> 12:06.100
Well, good luck to you all.

12:06.184 --> 12:07.894
Oh, no. You're coming too.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.188
Every mission needs a nerdy egghead guy

12:10.271 --> 12:12.607
who's always complaining
and getting scared

12:12.691 --> 12:14.526
and maybe gets killed at the end. Duh!

12:14.609 --> 12:15.985
And what about Maurice?

12:16.069 --> 12:20.448
Hmm. Well, I guess
he could be the comic relief

12:20.532 --> 12:22.325
but he's not taking "ladies' man" from me.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.035
Nobody takes "ladies' man" from me!

12:24.118 --> 12:26.079
I mean, where is he?

12:26.162 --> 12:27.830
Oh! Uh...

12:28.747 --> 12:29.748
[Julien] Mo-Mo?

12:29.832 --> 12:33.628
Oh, girl, if I don't know
where it's been, I ain't eatin' it.

12:33.712 --> 12:36.464
[gasps] Oh. We're rolling? [clears throat]

12:36.548 --> 12:40.427
The kingdom is frantically stockpiling
supplies for an alien invasion

12:40.510 --> 12:44.347
that at least one concerned citizen
is convinced, is inevitable.

12:44.763 --> 12:48.309
I don't want anybody to panic, but y'all
should be freaking out right now.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.311
This is a massive government cover-up!

12:50.395 --> 12:52.647
And these conspiracies
have been going on for years.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.274
Where do you think
the baobab tree came from?

12:54.357 --> 12:57.318
Ancient lemurs never could've built
something so advanced

12:57.402 --> 12:59.404
with all the whosies and whatsits.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.364
Ancient aliens built that, man!

13:01.531 --> 13:03.241
[Maurice screams, whimpers]

13:03.908 --> 13:06.911
And Maurice-in-a-bad-disguise
isn't the only citizen

13:06.994 --> 13:09.289
concerned about the upcoming invasion.

13:09.372 --> 13:10.665
[screaming]

13:11.165 --> 13:13.792
Yeah, my ex-boyfriend Errol got abducted.

13:13.876 --> 13:18.339
Used to be normal like me.
Now he's real weird. [slurps]

13:18.423 --> 13:21.509
Ted and I are so excited
about this weekend getaway.

13:21.593 --> 13:25.138
It's been ages since we've been
to a nice bed and breakfast.

13:25.221 --> 13:29.309
[Xixi] The village is being evacuated
to an underground bomb shelter.

13:29.434 --> 13:32.687
Oh. Well, do you know what
the brunch situation is in there?

13:33.563 --> 13:35.064
[farting]

13:35.148 --> 13:36.441
What was the question?

13:36.524 --> 13:38.318
[beeping]

13:38.401 --> 13:40.654
This should lead us right to him.

13:40.737 --> 13:44.115
Then let's get this
search party started, y'all!

13:44.198 --> 13:45.700
What what! [chuckles]

13:45.784 --> 13:46.867
-[door opening]
-[all gasping]

13:46.951 --> 13:48.787
The aliens took my mother.

13:48.869 --> 13:51.080
And now, I'm gonna get some answers.

13:51.164 --> 13:55.001
And when I get those answers,
I'm gonna get some revenge.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.210
We cool?

13:56.294 --> 13:58.672
Well, it's not really
a revenge mission, so--

13:58.755 --> 14:01.174
-It is now.
-[gun cocking]

14:01.257 --> 14:05.178
[panting]

14:05.303 --> 14:07.096
King Julien, the bunker's ready.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.599
We have to evacuate before it's too late.

14:09.683 --> 14:12.769
King Julien? Clover? Mort? I'm too late?

14:12.851 --> 14:15.021
The aliens must've gotten 'em already.

14:15.104 --> 14:17.440
Why? [sobbing]

14:17.524 --> 14:20.234
[shouts] Why!

14:20.318 --> 14:22.737
Everybody into the bunker.
Let's go!

14:22.821 --> 14:25.865
There's not much time
before they take you too! [groans]

14:25.948 --> 14:28.409
Where's King Julien?
Did something happen to him?

14:28.493 --> 14:32.747
King Julien is fine! And no,
I have not been crying.

14:32.831 --> 14:34.248
Nobody asked you about crying.

14:34.332 --> 14:37.918
'Cause he's fine! Now get in the bunker
before you end up like him.

14:38.002 --> 14:40.921
Oh, okay, well...
Wait! Didn't you just say he was fine?

14:41.005 --> 14:42.465
[mumbling]

14:45.343 --> 14:47.637
I think we got too many supplies.

14:48.471 --> 14:50.014
Everybody, push!

14:50.097 --> 14:52.266
[all straining]

14:52.350 --> 14:54.853
-Is it working? I think it's working.
-[groaning]

14:54.935 --> 14:58.189
Ted, it's not working.
There's just too much darn fruit!

14:58.314 --> 14:59.357
[groans]

14:59.440 --> 15:03.194
New plan. We eat our way in.
[shouts] Let's do this, people!

15:04.153 --> 15:07.323
-[all chomping]
-[slurping]

15:07.407 --> 15:10.284
Where will we go to the bathroom in there?

15:10.368 --> 15:14.205
[shouting] There's no time for questions!
Eat your way to safety, people!

15:14.497 --> 15:16.082
[continues chomping]

15:16.499 --> 15:17.709
[beeping]

15:17.792 --> 15:18.959
[grunts]

15:19.293 --> 15:20.795
[sniffing]

15:21.880 --> 15:23.256
[grunting]

15:24.382 --> 15:25.383
[gasps]

15:26.426 --> 15:27.510
Whoa!

15:31.890 --> 15:34.058
[Timo] Mort should be in there.

15:34.141 --> 15:36.310
[panting] Am I the only one out of breath?

15:36.394 --> 15:39.063
Pretty sure this is the most
I've ever moved. [continues panting]

15:39.146 --> 15:40.481
Everyone knows the plan, right?

15:40.565 --> 15:44.110
-Masikura, camouflage yourself--
-[shouting] For Mommy!

15:44.235 --> 15:46.487
[screaming]

15:46.571 --> 15:47.614
[grunts]

15:47.697 --> 15:51.075
-[shouts] Die, alien scum!
-[gun fires]

15:54.704 --> 15:55.872
[both tremble]

15:58.666 --> 15:59.626
[Mort screams in pain]

16:01.127 --> 16:02.086
Yay!

16:02.169 --> 16:04.297
Hector! Come on, buddy!

16:04.380 --> 16:06.299
That could've hit someone important!

16:06.382 --> 16:08.175
Also, I'm supposed to be the wild card.

16:08.259 --> 16:09.761
You're stepping on my bit, man!

16:09.844 --> 16:11.888
-[Timo panting]
-[Clover grunting]

16:13.222 --> 16:14.933
[Mort laughing hysterically]

16:15.558 --> 16:18.060
Now, we just need to get rid of this.

16:20.104 --> 16:22.398
-[Timo straining]
-[Mort giggles]

16:22.482 --> 16:23.399
[device beeping]

16:23.483 --> 16:26.778
Mm, bet this is gonna burn
on the way out. [gulps]

16:26.861 --> 16:27.904
[chuckles]

16:28.070 --> 16:28.988
[Clover grunts]

16:29.071 --> 16:31.031
-Clear. No sign of anyone.
-[Julien] Great.

16:31.115 --> 16:34.034
Then I'm gonna mess around
with all the expensive-looking alien junk

16:34.118 --> 16:36.078
I don't know how to use.
[laughing hysterically]

16:36.162 --> 16:39.540
Your Majesty, we don't know when
they'll be back. We need to... [grunts]

16:39.624 --> 16:42.794
Timo, what does this button do?
Is it a tractor beam?

16:42.877 --> 16:45.546
-I wouldn't touch that.
-I would. [laughs]

16:45.630 --> 16:47.214
Come on. We really should get out of here.

16:47.298 --> 16:48.299
[Timo struggling]

16:48.382 --> 16:51.135
[continues laughing]
Timo, where's the photon torpedoes?

16:52.553 --> 16:54.555
-[Julien continues laughing]
-[crashing]

16:55.682 --> 16:56.516
Hector?

16:56.599 --> 16:59.477
Mommy? You're... alive?

17:03.314 --> 17:04.565
Where have you been?

17:04.649 --> 17:10.530
Here. In this field biology laboratory,
living amongst the human scientists.

17:10.613 --> 17:11.447
Human?

17:11.531 --> 17:15.409
Humans are a species of large hairless ape

17:15.493 --> 17:20.581
that invented many gadgets,
but is otherwise completely stupid.

17:21.165 --> 17:24.126
[laughs] Dummies.
How did this get in my butt?

17:24.878 --> 17:27.380
-[Timo] King Julien, please be careful.
-[Julien] Nope!

17:27.463 --> 17:28.422
[crashing]

17:28.506 --> 17:31.384
You've been here the whole time?

17:31.467 --> 17:34.971
When I was first taken, I tried to escape.

17:35.054 --> 17:38.307
But as time passed,
I grew to like it here.

17:38.391 --> 17:41.644
Eventually, I realized
I could do good here.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.438
[Mort chomping]

17:44.522 --> 17:46.566
Pretend I'm not even here.

17:46.649 --> 17:48.693
[burps, continues chomping]

17:48.776 --> 17:52.947
Seriously? This is where
you've been for 20 years?

17:53.031 --> 17:54.615
You had a kid!

17:55.282 --> 17:56.868
Well, when you put it like that,

17:56.951 --> 17:58.244
yeah, I guess you're right.

17:58.327 --> 18:01.414
I've been an awful mother.
I'm so sorry, Hector.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.917
Listen... I mean, can we start over?

18:04.000 --> 18:06.878
That's the worst apology I've ever heard!

18:06.961 --> 18:09.714
You let your own kid think you were dead!

18:09.797 --> 18:11.632
I mean, who does that?

18:11.716 --> 18:14.134
Yeah, for real, Helen.

18:14.218 --> 18:17.055
-We need to evacuate the premises, now!
-[Julien straining]

18:17.137 --> 18:20.808
Not now, Clover,
I'm trying to find some black holes.

18:20.892 --> 18:22.018
-[crashing]
-[both groaning]

18:22.101 --> 18:25.271
I made a mistake,
and I want to make it up to you.

18:25.354 --> 18:26.439
[door slamming open]

18:26.522 --> 18:27.565
[Clover grunting]

18:33.613 --> 18:35.949
-[Julien exclaims]
-[Timo whimpering]

18:36.032 --> 18:37.909
-[shouts] Run!
-[Helen screams]

18:41.788 --> 18:43.247
[gasps, grunts]

18:44.457 --> 18:46.584
-Hey!
-[Julien chattering]

18:46.667 --> 18:48.461
Hello? Yoo-hoo!

18:48.544 --> 18:51.965
Space-freaks!
Ambassador of Earth down here.

18:52.048 --> 18:55.217
Greetings, aliens!

18:55.593 --> 18:58.888
[mimicking aliens, chuckles]

18:58.972 --> 19:01.766
However you guys say it.
I-I never studied that, so...

19:01.849 --> 19:03.810
Your Majesty, let's go!

19:03.893 --> 19:06.604
Not now, Clover. I'm ambassading.

19:06.938 --> 19:09.607
Now, let's talk alien technology.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.109
I wanna be able to teleport.

19:11.191 --> 19:12.819
Is that something you can help me with?

19:12.902 --> 19:15.446
[chattering]

19:16.280 --> 19:19.366
This is what passes
for "intelligent life forms"? Yeesh!

19:19.450 --> 19:23.203
[sighs] Bad news, everybody,
these aliens are duds.

19:24.038 --> 19:27.625
[grunts] Okay, look. Here's the deal.
Stop abducting Mort.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.086
Okay, that's one. And B, don't come back

19:30.169 --> 19:33.881
until you have better alien technology
to blow our mind spaces.

19:33.965 --> 19:36.050
Step up your game, space-freaks.

19:36.342 --> 19:37.885
My hero!

19:37.969 --> 19:39.512
Don't make it gross, Mort.

19:39.595 --> 19:42.222
Okay! Let's blow this joint, peoples.

19:46.102 --> 19:47.812
Hector, wrap it up.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.606
There's so much lost time to make up for.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.442
I'm ready to come back
to the village with you.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.736
To be your mom, again.

19:55.820 --> 19:58.114
You mean it? Oh, that's great.

19:59.115 --> 20:00.074
Um...

20:00.700 --> 20:04.286
-Where are you planning on living?
-Well, I assumed I would live with you.

20:04.370 --> 20:09.416
Uh, yeah. [stammering] I'm not really
looking for a roommate.

20:09.500 --> 20:12.461
Well, I'm barely there.
You'll never notice me.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.213
-Not really ideal--
-Maybe the six or seven times

20:14.296 --> 20:15.589
I get up to make a wee-wee.

20:15.673 --> 20:17.424
-...futon situation.
-That's okay, I'm--

20:17.508 --> 20:19.844
You know what?
I know where to find you now.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.804
I'll visit all the time.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.640
I-I'm not just
saying that either. I swear.

20:25.975 --> 20:27.977
[tracking device beeping]

20:32.648 --> 20:34.358
Bye, dear. Bye!

20:35.609 --> 20:38.905
[all humming]

20:39.613 --> 20:42.742
Yes, my peoples.
I have confronted the aliens

20:42.825 --> 20:44.535
and showed them who's boss.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.081
Uh... my peoples?

20:48.664 --> 20:51.959
Could it be some sort of
mass extinction event?

20:52.043 --> 20:54.879
Do not be ridiculous.
They were obviously raptured up

20:54.962 --> 20:57.297
to the Sky Gods' palace in Frankri-La.

20:57.381 --> 21:00.843
[shouts in despair]
Why didn't you take me, Frank?

21:00.927 --> 21:05.139
[sobbing] Why did I get left behind?

21:07.725 --> 21:10.644
Something tells me
they haven't gone anywhere.

21:10.728 --> 21:15.274
-[Clover grunting]
-[all screaming]

21:17.651 --> 21:19.862
King Julien? You're alive?

21:19.946 --> 21:25.201
We survived the alien invasion, y'all!
[shouts] We survived it!

21:25.284 --> 21:29.038
[techno music playing]

21:29.122 --> 21:30.748
[laughing hysterically]

21:30.873 --> 21:33.709
[shouts] I've never felt so alive!

21:33.793 --> 21:35.962
Hmm. [slurps]

21:36.045 --> 21:40.758
[laughing] This bunker party
is off the chizain, Mo-Mo.

21:40.841 --> 21:43.928
Hey, Horst, go easy
on the fruit punch, buddy.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.805
You know how you get. [chuckles]

21:45.888 --> 21:48.557
[nervously] I have a confession
to make, Your Majesty.

21:48.641 --> 21:52.561
I-I told the whole kingdom
you were covering up the alien abductions.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.897
-I'm sorry.
-Water under the bridge, buddy.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.942
I realized that those space freaks
don't know how to party anyway.

21:58.025 --> 22:01.779
But if you hadn't betrayed me,
your king and best friend,

22:01.862 --> 22:06.700
we wouldn't be going hard
at the most exclusive club ever!

22:06.826 --> 22:08.410
Did you see the line?

22:08.494 --> 22:11.122
Sir, I am a serious journalist.

22:11.205 --> 22:13.499
And this club wouldn't even exist
without me.

22:13.582 --> 22:16.127
Sorry, baby. It's a fire hazard.

22:16.210 --> 22:17.837
Oh... Okay.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.880
I see. [humming]

22:19.964 --> 22:21.590
I'll just, uh, go.

22:21.674 --> 22:22.967
Please, let me in!

22:23.050 --> 22:25.261
[shouting] I need
to get in there and party!

22:25.343 --> 22:27.138
-[Xixi] Please, let me in!
-[guard] Did you just try to bite me?

22:27.221 --> 22:29.765
-[Xixi screams]
-It's okay. It's okay.

22:29.890 --> 22:33.144
-[Xixi] Spring break. [snoring]
-[guard] Ssh, sleep now. Go to sleep.

22:33.227 --> 22:35.353
[Xixi mumbling] I just want to party.
[continues snoring]

22:35.437 --> 22:38.191
We did do a background check
on Butterfish, didn't we?

22:38.274 --> 22:40.276
Don't look at me. It's your club.

22:41.319 --> 22:43.154
[up-beat music playing]
