00:12.520 --> 00:13.960
Echo Two is away, sir.

00:14.200 --> 00:16.160
A clean launch.

00:16.920 --> 00:19.480
It's made contact with Echo One.

00:19.680 --> 00:22.160
How long before we get
subspace online?

00:22.360 --> 00:26.280
I'd like to send a few test
transmissions to calibrate amplifiers.

00:26.480 --> 00:28.480
- An hour.
- My guess is we have a lot of people

00:28.680 --> 00:31.240
onboard waiting to call home.

00:32.080 --> 00:34.400
A vessel is dropping
out of warp, captain.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.480
Twelve kilometres dead ahead.

00:36.720 --> 00:38.560
Put it up.

00:44.640 --> 00:47.680
- Look familiar?
- I don't recognize the configuration.

00:49.480 --> 00:51.240
Good. Hail them.

00:53.360 --> 00:57.400
This is the starship Enterprise.
What can we do for you?

01:03.240 --> 01:04.959
My name is Jonathan Archer.

01:05.200 --> 01:08.680
We're on a mission of exploration
from the planet Earth.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.520
- Hoshi?
- The channel's open, sir.

01:18.920 --> 01:20.480
Do you need assistance?

01:26.880 --> 01:30.520
If you don't wanna talk, that's fine,

01:30.720 --> 01:33.200
but you dropped in on us.

01:39.640 --> 01:42.520
Was it something I said?

01:44.160 --> 01:46.440
Did you get anything on sensors?

01:47.440 --> 01:49.200
No.

01:49.960 --> 01:51.520
No what?

01:51.760 --> 01:53.760
No bio-signs.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.960
No propulsion or weapon signatures.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.080
No readings at all.

02:03.880 --> 02:09.199
"It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here"

02:11.680 --> 02:15.080
"It's been a long time"

02:15.280 --> 02:19.120
"But my time is finally near"

02:19.360 --> 02:23.600
"And I will see my dream
Come alive at last"

02:23.800 --> 02:26.720
"I will touch the sky"

02:26.920 --> 02:30.720
"And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more"

02:30.920 --> 02:33.920
"No, they're not gonna change my mind"

02:34.160 --> 02:38.840
"'Cause I've got faith of the heart"

02:39.080 --> 02:42.000
"I'm going where my heart will take me"

02:42.200 --> 02:46.800
"I've got faith to believe"

02:47.000 --> 02:49.560
"I can do anything"

02:49.800 --> 02:54.280
"I've got strength of the soul"

02:54.480 --> 02:57.360
"And no one's gonna bend or break me"

02:57.600 --> 03:02.920
"I can reach any star"

03:03.280 --> 03:07.040
"I've got faith"

03:07.280 --> 03:10.960
"I've got faith"

03:11.200 --> 03:15.960
"Faith of the heart"

03:30.880 --> 03:33.160
Are there any inhabited
systems nearby?

03:33.360 --> 03:35.160
None.

03:35.360 --> 03:38.160
Why fly right up to us
just to give us the silent treatment?

03:38.360 --> 03:41.200
Maybe they got our signal,
but it didn't make any sense to them.

03:41.400 --> 03:45.080
- Our translator is far from perfect.
- I wouldn't take offence.

03:45.320 --> 03:48.960
Not every species has motives that
can be understood in human terms.

03:49.640 --> 03:52.760
Maybe they checked us out and
decided we weren't very interesting.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.920
Us? Not interesting?

03:57.280 --> 04:00.200
Let's calibrate
the subspace amplifier.

04:00.400 --> 04:03.600
At least the people back home
wanna talk to us.

04:04.600 --> 04:06.320
Sir.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.960
I tracked them down.

04:10.120 --> 04:12.120
- It took me all week.
- Where are they?

04:12.320 --> 04:15.120
Kota Baharu. It's in Malaysia.

04:15.320 --> 04:19.000
- What time is it there?
- A little after 9 at night.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.200
That shouldn't be too late.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.720
Let's break in that new amplifier.
I'll be in my Ready Room.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.840
- Is he all right?
- He's fine.

04:30.040 --> 04:34.440
- Is he in some kind of trouble?
- No, sir. Malcolm's doing a great job.

04:34.640 --> 04:37.000
I'm sure you know it's his birthday
in a couple of days.

04:37.280 --> 04:40.520
Yes. Yes, it is. September 2nd.

04:40.720 --> 04:44.280
We haven't seen our son
on his birthday in quite a few years.

04:44.480 --> 04:48.160
He called from San Francisco to let us
know he'd been assigned to Enterprise,

04:48.360 --> 04:52.000
but we haven't heard
from him since.

04:52.320 --> 04:55.000
What are Malcolm's duties
on your ship, captain?

04:56.080 --> 04:57.520
He's my armoury officer.

04:57.800 --> 04:59.120
Well...

04:59.320 --> 05:01.840
His grandfather would be pleased.

05:02.040 --> 05:05.360
He was an ordinance oficer
himself in the Royal Navy.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.000
It must be in Malcolm's blood.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.800
The Reeds have been navy men
for generations.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.480
Until Malcolm decided
to join Starfleet.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.800
I suppose the ocean
wasn't big enough for him.

05:17.200 --> 05:20.640
He's a long way from home
in any case, Mr Reed.

05:20.840 --> 05:24.560
I'd like to do something for his birthday,
make him a special dinner.

05:24.760 --> 05:27.080
I was hoping you could tell me
what he likes to eat.

05:27.920 --> 05:32.560
Captain, Malcolm's never been
comfortable making requests.

05:33.560 --> 05:34.960
I'm not sure I understand.

05:35.280 --> 05:37.720
He always ate whatever
was put in front of him.

05:38.560 --> 05:41.240
Are you saying he doesn't have
a favourite food?

05:41.840 --> 05:44.360
Not that he's ever told me.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.480
Well...

05:49.280 --> 05:50.880
...if you happen to think of anything,

05:51.080 --> 05:53.280
you can always contact me
through Starfleet.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.600
Give Malcolm our best.

05:56.400 --> 06:00.120
- I will.
- Safe journey, captain.

06:19.520 --> 06:22.040
- How'd it go?
- Could have gone better.

06:22.240 --> 06:25.240
Apparently, he hasn't called home
since we left Earth.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.240
I want you to find out
what he likes to eat.

06:28.120 --> 06:30.080
- Me, sir?
- But don't let Malcolm know.

06:30.280 --> 06:32.400
Maybe this is more in chef's area.

06:32.680 --> 06:35.360
We're talking about
a delicate assignment, Hoshi.

06:35.600 --> 06:36.760
It needs your finesse.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.080
Sir, I'm running a diagnostic
on our subspace-transceiver array.

06:41.320 --> 06:44.920
Get some help if you need it,
but make this a top priority.

06:45.680 --> 06:47.560
That's an order.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.520
Yes, sir.

06:56.680 --> 06:59.000
- Where were you at dinner?
- I ate in my quarters.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.800
Now that we've got
the amplifier working,

07:01.040 --> 07:02.760
I wanted to answer a few letters.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.600
You missed T'Pol's latest bout
with chopsticks.

07:05.840 --> 07:07.720
Damn. Dinner and a show.

07:10.400 --> 07:12.560
I thought you were
gonna upgrade this.

07:12.840 --> 07:14.640
That is the upgrade.

07:15.840 --> 07:18.200
Well, if you want,
I can change the colour.

07:22.280 --> 07:26.440
- What's the word from home?
- Oh, the usual. Engineering updates.

07:26.640 --> 07:29.520
Oh, and Duvall got promoted.

07:29.720 --> 07:32.880
- They're giving him the Shenandoah.
- Duvall got his own command?

07:34.560 --> 07:36.600
Thank God we're
a hundred light years away.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.240
And I got a letter from Natalie.

07:43.160 --> 07:46.320
- The Natalie, from Pensacola?
- Yep.

07:46.520 --> 07:49.160
Natalie from Pensacola.

07:49.880 --> 07:53.120
Looks like we've got a charge
imbalance in this manifold.

07:53.320 --> 07:54.880
I'll get right on it.

07:58.920 --> 08:00.680
Trip?

08:01.720 --> 08:05.160
You know, they say long-distance
relationships never work.

08:06.240 --> 08:09.680
Well, this is about
as long distance as you can get.

08:11.040 --> 08:12.720
Are you okay?

08:13.440 --> 08:15.520
Oh, yeah. I just...

08:16.440 --> 08:19.240
I just wish I'd have had the chance
to say goodbye face-to-face.

08:29.680 --> 08:32.000
Let me ask you something.

08:32.200 --> 08:34.000
Do you spend much time
with Malcolm?

08:34.200 --> 08:36.320
I was in the armoury yesterday
for a few hours,

08:36.520 --> 08:38.000
swapping out some power relays.

08:38.200 --> 08:42.200
- You talk about anything interesting?
- Power relays.

08:42.919 --> 08:45.480
- I talked to his parents this morning.
- Really?

08:45.720 --> 08:47.160
Yeah.

08:47.760 --> 08:48.960
Sit.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.200
If I asked your parents
what you liked to eat,

08:53.440 --> 08:55.560
- would they be able to tell me?
- Are you kidding?

08:56.080 --> 08:58.520
My mom would give you her recipe
for pan-fried catfish,

08:58.720 --> 09:02.400
and wouldn't let you go
till you promised not to screw it up.

09:02.600 --> 09:06.400
Malcolm's parents didn't know
what his favourite food was.

09:06.600 --> 09:09.280
They didn't even know
he was an armoury officer.

09:09.480 --> 09:10.800
That's strange.

09:11.040 --> 09:12.840
It made me think.

09:13.080 --> 09:17.040
We don't know that much
about Malcolm, do we?

09:18.720 --> 09:20.560
Bridge to the captain.

09:20.800 --> 09:24.080
- Go ahead.
- The alien vessel has returned.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.560
Guess we weren't
so uninteresting after all.

09:36.760 --> 09:39.560
They dropped out of warp
500 kilometres dead ahead.

09:39.760 --> 09:43.080
I had to reverse engines
to keep from banging into them.

09:43.320 --> 09:45.120
Let's try this again.

09:47.640 --> 09:49.640
Welcome back.

09:53.560 --> 09:56.920
I was hoping we'd have
an opportunity to meet again.

09:57.120 --> 09:58.960
The primary mission of my ship

09:59.160 --> 10:03.280
is to make peaceful contact
with other species.

10:06.160 --> 10:11.360
If there's anything we can do
to assure you of our intentions...

10:20.080 --> 10:21.840
Well...

10:22.560 --> 10:24.760
It's been nice talking to you.

10:24.960 --> 10:27.160
Let's do this again sometime.

10:27.440 --> 10:29.840
- I'm picking up something.
- Can you translate it?

10:30.640 --> 10:32.120
I don't think it's a language.

10:37.320 --> 10:38.840
We're being scanned.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.800
Hull plating.

10:48.120 --> 10:50.080
It's off-line!

10:52.920 --> 10:54.520
Hard about.

10:54.760 --> 10:56.480
They've gone to warp, sir.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.040
Everybody okay?

11:04.240 --> 11:06.880
Damage reports are coming in, sir.

11:07.080 --> 11:10.600
- No one's been hurt.
- What the hell was that about?

11:10.800 --> 11:13.240
Captain, when they
fired their weapon,

11:13.440 --> 11:15.680
they dropped their shielding
for about two seconds.

11:15.880 --> 11:18.720
- I was able to take some scans.
- What did you get?

11:18.960 --> 11:22.000
Bio-signs. At least 15, maybe more.

11:22.240 --> 11:25.240
Their DNA doesn't match
anything in our database.

11:25.440 --> 11:26.720
It's a good thing they're gone.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.840
I doubt very much our torpedoes
could've penetrated their shielding.

11:31.640 --> 11:34.000
Stay on long-range scanners.

11:34.200 --> 11:37.200
If they come anywhere near us,
I wanna know.

11:37.400 --> 11:39.200
T'Pol.

11:46.880 --> 11:50.800
That support frame's bent.
We'll need to reinforce it.

11:56.520 --> 11:59.520
- How bad is it?
- If that shot was a half metre higher,

11:59.720 --> 12:01.920
- we'd be looking at stars.
- Hold it a minute!

12:02.160 --> 12:05.480
There were 13 people working in this
section, captain, including yours truly.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.600
If that bulkhead had blown...

12:12.080 --> 12:14.080
Did your people run into
as many hostile aliens

12:14.280 --> 12:17.160
when they first went
into deep space?

12:18.160 --> 12:21.120
- It was a different time.
- How so?

12:21.320 --> 12:24.040
There were fewer
warp-capable species.

12:24.520 --> 12:26.000
This ship just isn't equipped
to handle

12:26.200 --> 12:28.920
some of the threats
we're coming up against.

12:29.120 --> 12:32.440
- It's time we do something about that.
- What are you suggesting?

12:32.640 --> 12:35.120
Enterprise was fitted
with phase-cannon ports.

12:35.360 --> 12:37.520
Since we left space dock a few weeks
ahead of schedule,

12:37.720 --> 12:40.200
the cannons were never installed.

12:42.680 --> 12:45.320
I think it's time they were.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.640
We should head back to Earth.

12:47.880 --> 12:50.600
- Just give us two weeks, captain.
- I know we can do it.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.760
Most of the stuff we need
is already on the ship.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.840
The armoury team at Jupiter Station
is trained for this kind of work.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.000
If we're gonna do this,
let's do it right.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.920
My engineers
are just as good as they are.

13:01.120 --> 13:02.720
I know that, Trip.

13:02.920 --> 13:06.400
But we have other systems
that could use overhauls.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.120
Look at the bright side.

13:10.320 --> 13:13.040
You'll get a chance
to say goodbye to Natalie.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.480
Sir,

13:15.680 --> 13:18.120
with your permission,
we could at least begin the work,

13:18.400 --> 13:20.160
get a few things started
for Jupiter Station.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.880
It'll cut down the time we'll have
to spend in space dock.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.560
Do what you can.

13:28.520 --> 13:31.320
- Archer to Mayweather.
- Go ahead, captain.

13:34.120 --> 13:35.960
We're heading home.

13:57.320 --> 13:59.400
This, ladies and gentlemen,

13:59.600 --> 14:02.520
is a phase-modulated
energy weapon.

14:02.720 --> 14:07.720
It's rated for a maximum power output
of 500 gigajoules.

14:07.920 --> 14:10.440
Enterprise was designed
to carry three of them.

14:10.640 --> 14:12.000
We have one,

14:12.240 --> 14:14.440
and it's only a prototype.

14:14.640 --> 14:18.680
Our job is to get it up and running
and build two more from scratch.

14:18.920 --> 14:21.920
The captain's taking us back because
he thinks this work ought to be done

14:22.120 --> 14:23.720
by the boys in space dock.

14:23.960 --> 14:26.640
Far be it from me to question
the captain's judgment,

14:26.880 --> 14:29.600
but Commander Tucker and I
believe we can do this ourselves.

14:29.840 --> 14:31.440
That means double shifts.

14:31.680 --> 14:34.200
By the time we reach
Jupiter Station,

14:34.400 --> 14:36.360
I don't want their engineers
to have a thing to do

14:36.600 --> 14:39.120
but give us a wash and a wax.

14:39.320 --> 14:42.320
- Any questions?
- Are we expecting another attack, sir?

14:43.880 --> 14:45.040
We all signed up for this trip

14:45.240 --> 14:48.600
because we wanted to do something
no one had ever done before,

14:48.800 --> 14:53.200
not because we thought
it'd be easy or safe.

14:53.400 --> 14:56.320
But we're not here
to take foolish risks.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.720
The captain and the rest of the crew
are depending on us

14:58.920 --> 15:00.760
to keep Enterprise ready
for anything.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.040
And once we get these
phase-cannons online,

15:04.240 --> 15:07.840
we'll have a lot more firepower
to do just that.

15:09.320 --> 15:10.840
So, what are you
standing around for?

15:15.000 --> 15:17.600
He once told me that he loved
to eat octopus,

15:17.800 --> 15:21.560
especially the little suction cups,
but I think he was pulling my leg.

15:22.040 --> 15:25.600
You can never tell whether
my brother's joking or not.

15:26.280 --> 15:27.440
Can I talk to him?

15:27.680 --> 15:30.640
We really would like
to keep this a surprise.

15:30.880 --> 15:32.680
Oh, right, the dinner.

15:32.880 --> 15:36.800
I remember one time,
this was at least ten years ago,

15:37.000 --> 15:38.880
he went for a whole week
without eating.

15:39.160 --> 15:40.600
- Really?
- Got by on nothing

15:40.800 --> 15:42.520
but water and a little apple juice.

15:42.760 --> 15:46.280
- Why?
- Some sort of survival training.

15:46.520 --> 15:48.000
Or was it a contest?

15:48.240 --> 15:51.680
When he started eating again, do you
remember the first thing he wanted?

15:51.920 --> 15:54.280
He was so weak,
he could barely get out of bed.

15:54.480 --> 15:57.040
For two days, all he had
was protein concentrate.

15:57.240 --> 16:00.320
When you two were growing up,
he never said:

16:00.520 --> 16:03.080
"Hey, let's go out for pizza,"

16:03.280 --> 16:05.920
or "Boy, I'd love some Indian food."

16:06.360 --> 16:08.240
Not that I remember.

16:08.480 --> 16:11.640
Malcolm isn't the easiest person
to get to know.

16:12.080 --> 16:14.480
I'm figuring that out.

16:15.720 --> 16:17.040
When we trained in San Francisco,

16:17.280 --> 16:20.360
there was a little restaurant on
the Embarcadero he liked to go to.

16:20.560 --> 16:23.560
They had a specialty,
some kind of fish, I think.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.480
What kind?

16:26.480 --> 16:29.680
- Halibut? Swordfish?
- No.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.520
Mahi-mahi? Scallops?

16:32.760 --> 16:35.600
- I had sea bass.
- Great.

16:35.880 --> 16:38.320
- And Malcolm?
- I don't remember.

16:38.560 --> 16:40.600
Try, please.

16:41.840 --> 16:42.880
Maureen.

16:43.880 --> 16:46.800
- Is that a fish?
- No, she was the waitress.

16:48.600 --> 16:51.840
That's why Malcolm wanted
to go there. He had a thing for her.

16:52.040 --> 16:54.600
- I think he hates fish.
- Thanks.

17:01.480 --> 17:04.000
So how's your
secret mission coming?

17:04.760 --> 17:07.800
I've talked to his sister,
his best friend,

17:08.000 --> 17:10.359
his Uncle Archie,
his two spinster aunts.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.800
The most anyone seems to know
about his eating habits

17:13.040 --> 17:15.800
is that he occasionally eats.

17:16.040 --> 17:17.560
Ensign.

17:18.119 --> 17:20.200
If you want to know something
about Mr Reed,

17:20.400 --> 17:22.839
perhaps you should ask him.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.120
Anyone sitting here?

17:39.360 --> 17:41.680
No. Please.

17:43.720 --> 17:46.720
This is the first chance
I've had to eat all day.

17:46.920 --> 17:49.280
Oh, tell me about it.

17:49.480 --> 17:52.560
I haven't set foot outside
the armoury since 0700.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.840
How's your ravioli?

17:57.320 --> 17:59.120
It's fine.

17:59.360 --> 18:02.320
Nothing like a nice plate of pasta.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.560
You know, I used to love to cook,
but I never get a chance to anymore.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.560
And the way the chef
protects the galley...

18:19.680 --> 18:21.080
One of these nights,

18:21.280 --> 18:24.120
I should fix something myself.

18:27.320 --> 18:30.760
- I'm sorry.
- You'd love my enchiladas.

18:30.960 --> 18:32.280
Enchiladas?

18:33.240 --> 18:35.640
Well, if you don't like them,
I can fix something else.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.360
What's your favourite food?

18:43.720 --> 18:45.600
I appreciate the offer,

18:45.840 --> 18:47.560
but it really isn't necessary.

18:49.680 --> 18:54.800
Aren't you a little tired of having to eat
whatever chef happens to serve?

18:55.000 --> 18:57.800
- No, he's a fine cook.
- Don't get me wrong.

18:58.040 --> 18:59.280
He's terrific.

18:59.520 --> 19:02.360
It's just that dinner in the mess hall

19:02.600 --> 19:06.440
can lack a certain personal touch.
I've got a hot plate in my quarters.

19:11.480 --> 19:14.680
That's very flattering...

19:15.880 --> 19:18.280
...and I'm just not sure
it would be appropriate.

19:19.120 --> 19:20.240
What do you mean?

19:20.920 --> 19:22.200
Well...

19:22.400 --> 19:24.560
...we work together...

19:25.160 --> 19:28.240
...and it just might be
a little awkward...

19:29.160 --> 19:30.440
...serving on the same ship.

19:30.640 --> 19:32.640
What does that have to do with...?

19:37.080 --> 19:39.760
No, I didn't... I didn't mean

19:39.960 --> 19:43.960
to imply anything other than
just making dinner, lieutenant.

19:44.160 --> 19:46.920
- Well, then, it's my mistake then...
- No, it's my fault.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.040
I shouldn't have...

19:49.920 --> 19:52.040
- Yeah, I'll just...
- No, please, finish your dinner.

19:52.240 --> 19:54.360
No, no, no, you've got
a lot of work to do.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.240
So...

20:11.720 --> 20:14.640
Captain, I'm detecting
a ship dead astern.

20:14.880 --> 20:19.360
- Eight thousand metres.
- Let me guess. Our shadow?

20:19.560 --> 20:21.760
Closing to 7,000.

20:23.160 --> 20:25.360
Six thousand.

20:25.840 --> 20:28.440
Polarize the hull plating.

20:38.080 --> 20:39.960
Reed to bridge.

20:40.160 --> 20:42.280
Armoury, report.

20:42.480 --> 20:44.720
Get to your stations. Move.

20:49.720 --> 20:51.320
Warp drive is off-line.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.520
Main power is down.

21:08.840 --> 21:10.760
Torpedoes.

21:13.960 --> 21:15.160
Tactical systems are down.

21:15.440 --> 21:19.960
Why don't you save time,
and tell me what isn't down?

21:20.200 --> 21:22.360
The outer doors
in Launch Bay 2 are opening.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.400
- Seal them.
- I can't.

22:47.080 --> 22:48.600
Get away from those men!

23:11.440 --> 23:13.040
Go.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.960
- Archer to Sickbay.
- Phlox here, captain.

23:16.160 --> 23:19.160
Report to E Deck, Section 7.
This is an emergency.

23:19.360 --> 23:20.920
On my way.

23:23.640 --> 23:26.040
- Security to Captain Archer.
- Go ahead.

23:26.240 --> 23:30.080
The aliens are gone, sir.
They've launched their shuttle.

23:44.320 --> 23:47.440
- Bridge, report!
- The alien vessel has gone to warp.

23:47.640 --> 23:52.640
But that last shot damaged our port
nacelle. We're venting drive plasma.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.760
Doctor?

24:04.800 --> 24:05.920
I've stabilized them,

24:06.120 --> 24:09.760
but they were subjected
to some rather invasive scans.

24:12.600 --> 24:13.840
Will they be all right?

24:14.040 --> 24:16.320
There could be some residual
neurological damage.

24:16.520 --> 24:17.800
I'm doing everything I can.

24:18.760 --> 24:20.600
Have you ever heard
of anything like this?

24:20.800 --> 24:22.400
No.

24:22.600 --> 24:25.680
Are there any Vulcan records of
a species that uses similar tactics?

24:25.880 --> 24:28.560
And I don't care
how classified they might be.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.800
None that I know of, captain.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.040
Find out what you can.

24:36.240 --> 24:38.320
Tucker to Archer.

24:40.320 --> 24:42.240
- Go ahead.
- We've got the plasma leak

24:42.440 --> 24:44.880
under control, but our port nacelle
took a lot of damage.

24:45.080 --> 24:48.680
- How long before we can go to warp?
- A couple of days.

24:49.560 --> 24:52.400
- What about impulse power?
- Well, that's the good news.

24:52.680 --> 24:54.800
It should be back online
in a few minutes.

24:55.040 --> 24:57.400
I'll take all the good news I can get.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.800
Keep me posted, doctor.

25:03.360 --> 25:06.720
There are no Vulcan ships
within scanning range.

25:07.520 --> 25:10.080
Sir, we could try to contact
the Vulcan High Command.

25:10.720 --> 25:12.880
They're only two days away
at warp six.

25:13.120 --> 25:14.960
I'm sure they'd give us a hand.

25:15.160 --> 25:17.040
I'm sure they would.

25:35.760 --> 25:37.760
I can't raise Vulcan.

25:37.960 --> 25:40.840
It's funny. I ran a diagnostic
after the attack.

25:41.080 --> 25:43.120
But now Echo Two won't respond.

25:43.400 --> 25:46.320
- That's because it isn't there.
- What?

25:46.560 --> 25:50.680
Nothing but debris at the coordinates
where we deployed the amplifier.

25:50.880 --> 25:52.200
What about Echo One?

25:54.000 --> 25:55.480
Destroyed as well.

26:04.040 --> 26:06.440
The stabilizer on cannon port two
checks out okay, sir.

26:06.640 --> 26:08.880
- Port two or port one?
- Port one, sir. Sorry.

26:09.080 --> 26:10.960
Get it right.

26:11.160 --> 26:12.960
- Start on those beam emitters.
- Yes, sir.

26:13.160 --> 26:15.040
Targeting scanners
will be online in an hour.

26:15.240 --> 26:19.160
We should be aligning them by now,
not installing them.

26:28.960 --> 26:30.680
You were a little hard on Eddie.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.760
Everyone's busting their tails
to get this job done.

26:34.320 --> 26:36.800
- You okay?
- Yeah.

26:37.320 --> 26:38.520
I'm fine.

26:38.720 --> 26:42.360
- I told them to depolarise these relays.
- What were you trying to do?

26:42.560 --> 26:44.840
- Bypass the EPS grid.
- Why?

26:45.080 --> 26:47.960
We could draw power for the cannons
directly from the impulse engines.

26:48.160 --> 26:50.320
Are you trying to make this
blow up in your face?

26:50.520 --> 26:52.480
The relays were rated to handle
that much power.

26:52.720 --> 26:55.080
- What if there's a surge?
- I've thought of that.

26:55.280 --> 26:58.520
These inverters were designed to cut
in at the first sign of an overload.

26:58.760 --> 27:00.000
We gotta do this by the book,

27:00.200 --> 27:03.680
or we'll end up blowing a bigger hole
in ourselves than the bad guys.

27:03.880 --> 27:08.720
I've run a dozen simulations.
It's an acceptable risk.

27:09.440 --> 27:12.040
When it comes to modifying
ship's systems,

27:12.280 --> 27:16.560
why don't you let the chief engineer
decide what's an acceptable risk.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.560
Sir...

27:19.240 --> 27:21.360
...if we do this by the book,

27:21.560 --> 27:24.360
those aliens are likely to be back
before we're done.

27:24.560 --> 27:27.000
I wanna get this job done
as quickly as you do, lieutenant,

27:27.200 --> 27:32.120
but not if it means taking shortcuts
that could get our people killed.

27:34.040 --> 27:35.960
Yes, sir.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.080
Don't you ever rest?

27:55.320 --> 27:58.240
You know, I can't sleep
without the warp engines online.

27:58.440 --> 28:01.600
If I don't feel those vibrations,
something just doesn't seem right.

28:01.840 --> 28:04.560
Well, I hope you get them fixed soon,
because you look like hell.

28:05.160 --> 28:08.240
Well, with all due respect, captain,
you shouldn't be talking.

28:09.800 --> 28:11.000
How's it coming?

28:11.200 --> 28:14.760
Lt'll be online by the end of the day
tomorrow, guaranteed.

28:17.200 --> 28:19.360
Could you check
the dilithium alignment for me?

28:19.560 --> 28:21.240
Sure.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.920
.06 microns.

28:32.160 --> 28:35.000
At least we'll be flying home
under our own power.

28:36.400 --> 28:38.640
Let me know if it drops
below .03.

28:41.160 --> 28:46.000
I tried to get a message to the Vulcan
High Command, but it didn't go through.

28:46.240 --> 28:49.760
If it had, we'd be expecting
a Surak-class ship tomorrow,

28:49.960 --> 28:52.560
oh-so-politely offering to help us.

28:52.800 --> 28:54.560
Well, the Vulcans
would've loved that.

28:54.760 --> 28:58.120
Towing the pride of Starfleet
back to base.

28:58.720 --> 29:02.440
Maybe we should thank our visitors
for blowing up the subspace amplifiers.

29:06.840 --> 29:08.320
It's holding at .05.

29:08.920 --> 29:10.800
Keep an eye on it.

29:12.440 --> 29:15.040
You looking forward to seeing Earth?

29:16.280 --> 29:17.480
Sure.

29:17.680 --> 29:20.640
I just didn't think
I'd be seeing it so soon.

29:21.400 --> 29:23.000
This time,

29:23.200 --> 29:25.600
we won't be leaving
before we're ready.

29:27.040 --> 29:29.080
Are your ears
a little pointier than usual?

29:29.880 --> 29:31.600
I...

29:33.280 --> 29:35.480
I never said
we didn't belong out here.

29:35.720 --> 29:38.320
I just wish we'd have...

29:38.520 --> 29:41.280
...launched with
all our systems online,

29:41.480 --> 29:43.240
especially weapons.

29:43.480 --> 29:45.600
If we hadn't launched when we did,

29:45.840 --> 29:48.760
they'd have sent Klaang
back to Kronos in a box.

29:49.120 --> 29:52.120
I keep reminding myself of that.

29:52.320 --> 29:57.280
But I rushed us out of space dock
because I had something to prove.

29:57.520 --> 29:59.880
And I risked the lives...

30:00.840 --> 30:03.880
...of 81 humans, a Vulcan
and a Denobulan to do it.

30:04.120 --> 30:05.600
Don't forget Porthos.

30:07.320 --> 30:08.960
Thanks.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.960
In the old days,
astronauts rode rockets

30:12.200 --> 30:15.200
with millions of litres of hydrogen
burning under their seats.

30:15.400 --> 30:16.880
You think they said:

30:17.120 --> 30:21.320
"Gee, I'd love to go to the moon today,
but it seems a little risky"?

30:22.320 --> 30:24.240
I think if you asked anyone onboard

30:24.480 --> 30:26.920
whether they thought this mission
was worth the risk,

30:27.120 --> 30:30.160
you'd get the same answer
from every one of them.

30:36.760 --> 30:38.840
Let me know
when we're ready to go to warp.

30:40.040 --> 30:41.800
Aye, sir.

30:51.120 --> 30:53.640
Have you still got those guns
hooked up to the impulse engines?

30:53.840 --> 30:57.000
- I'm just disconnecting them now.
- Hang on a minute.

30:59.280 --> 31:01.200
You're sure this will work?

31:01.400 --> 31:03.920
Yes, commander, I am.

31:04.400 --> 31:07.040
Then based on the recommendation
of the armoury officer,

31:07.240 --> 31:10.000
the chief engineer finds
the level of risk acceptable.

31:12.320 --> 31:16.840
In that case, if the chief engineer
wouldn't mind getting his hands dirty,

31:17.040 --> 31:18.520
I could use some help.

31:22.640 --> 31:26.120
Captain's starlog,
September 1 st, 2151.

31:26.320 --> 31:29.440
It's been two days now
with no sign of the alien vessel.

31:29.680 --> 31:32.120
My crew has managed
to do in 48 hours

31:32.360 --> 31:36.360
what would've taken the armoury team
at Jupiter Station at least a week.

31:36.560 --> 31:39.560
To say that I am proud of them
would be an understatement.

31:40.320 --> 31:42.800
We're preparing our first test.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.200
Everybody has their fingers crossed,

31:45.400 --> 31:47.800
including me.

31:50.200 --> 31:53.000
- Sure there's nothing down there?
- Yes, captain.

31:53.200 --> 31:55.200
Not even a microbe?
I don't wanna blow up something

31:55.400 --> 31:58.520
that could evolve into a sentient
species in a couple of billion years.

31:58.760 --> 32:01.000
There's nothing there.

32:01.840 --> 32:04.640
Archer to Lieutenant Reed.
Have you got a lock?

32:04.840 --> 32:07.840
- Yes, captain.
- Let's start small.

32:08.040 --> 32:10.680
Shave a couple of metres
off the top of that peak.

32:11.680 --> 32:14.200
Acquiring the target.

32:14.920 --> 32:17.880
Full power to the primary coils.

32:24.760 --> 32:27.360
Phase-cannons one and two,
standing by.

32:28.560 --> 32:30.680
Mr Reed,

32:30.880 --> 32:33.000
the honour is all yours.

32:47.200 --> 32:48.920
I just asked for a little off the top.

32:49.600 --> 32:52.800
- Check the cannons. Be careful there.
- Yes, sir.

32:53.480 --> 32:56.000
The blast yield was ten times
what we expected.

32:56.200 --> 32:57.320
What happened?

32:57.560 --> 33:00.600
Something overloaded
the phase modulators.

33:00.840 --> 33:03.360
The plasma recoil blew out relays
across decks C and D.

33:03.600 --> 33:06.360
I'm getting an anomalous reading
from Launch Bay 2.

33:06.920 --> 33:09.560
Trip, T'Pol.

33:32.960 --> 33:35.160
There. What's that?

33:37.680 --> 33:39.600
You think that's what's causing
the power surge?

33:39.800 --> 33:41.560
It's very likely.

33:41.880 --> 33:44.920
It's putting out a tremendous
amount of energy.

33:45.120 --> 33:47.480
Over 600 megajoules.

33:48.280 --> 33:50.480
They're toying with us.

33:50.800 --> 33:53.960
They want us to know they can
destroy us whenever they want,

33:54.200 --> 33:55.840
even with our own weapons.

33:56.080 --> 33:57.720
Whatever it is,

33:57.920 --> 34:00.720
it's tapped into most of our systems,
including internal sensors,

34:01.000 --> 34:03.440
and communications on every deck.

34:09.600 --> 34:13.040
Activate visual sensor J-15.

34:14.080 --> 34:19.960
I assume you planted that because
you wanted to learn more about us.

34:21.239 --> 34:24.120
I'll be happy to give you
a quick lesson.

34:24.560 --> 34:26.920
We're not here to make enemies.

34:27.120 --> 34:29.199
But just because we're not
looking for a fight

34:29.440 --> 34:32.560
doesn't mean we'll
run away from one.

34:32.760 --> 34:35.639
You may think
you've left us defenceless,

34:35.840 --> 34:38.480
but let me tell you something
about humans.

34:38.679 --> 34:40.960
We don't give up easily.

34:41.679 --> 34:44.560
We'll protect Enterprise...

34:47.800 --> 34:50.000
...any way we can.

34:56.920 --> 34:58.640
Doctor?

34:59.240 --> 35:01.680
I'll be with you in a moment, ensign.

35:02.360 --> 35:04.360
I see you released your patients.

35:05.240 --> 35:08.520
They're going to be fine. I sent them
back to their quarters to rest.

35:08.720 --> 35:09.840
That's good to hear.

35:12.560 --> 35:13.880
What can I do for you?

35:15.680 --> 35:18.040
You spend a lot of time
in the mess hall.

35:18.280 --> 35:20.440
Have you ever had a meal
with Lieutenant Reed?

35:20.640 --> 35:21.960
Many times.

35:22.200 --> 35:25.080
Any idea what his favourite food
might be?

35:26.240 --> 35:28.680
Ah, the birthday dinner.

35:30.200 --> 35:31.640
Well, the man
loves a good breakfast.

35:31.920 --> 35:34.840
- Like what?
- Eggs. I've seen him eat a lot of eggs.

35:35.040 --> 35:39.040
- How does he like them?
- Scrambled, poached, over easy.

35:39.280 --> 35:42.560
Maybe chef could make him
a big omelette.

35:42.840 --> 35:45.160
Oh, and he enjoys pancakes,
on occasion.

35:45.360 --> 35:47.920
He has the odd habit of spreading
peanut butter on them.

35:48.120 --> 35:51.480
Sausage, another favourite too.
Bacon too, come to think of it.

35:51.680 --> 35:54.760
Is there any one food in particular?

35:57.160 --> 35:58.400
Not that I recall.

36:01.880 --> 36:05.480
Breaking a Vulcan encryption code
would be easier than this.

36:05.680 --> 36:08.440
If anything comes to mind,
I'll let you know.

36:08.640 --> 36:11.120
I don't suppose scanning
his taste buds would help.

36:11.640 --> 36:14.640
Medically speaking,
there's no accounting for taste.

36:15.640 --> 36:17.760
Thanks anyway.

36:19.280 --> 36:21.760
- Bromelain.
- Sorry?

36:22.000 --> 36:23.880
I think I can help you, ensign.

36:25.320 --> 36:29.320
But it would mean going into
Mr Reed's medical records.

36:29.560 --> 36:31.120
That information is confidential.

36:31.320 --> 36:34.560
I'm under direct orders
from the captain.

36:35.480 --> 36:38.280
Couldn't you make an exception?

36:39.240 --> 36:43.040
Under the circumstances,
I suppose it wouldn't hurt.

36:46.200 --> 36:49.200
I've made it a point to study
each crewman's medical history,

36:49.400 --> 36:51.880
and I remember noticing that
Lieutenant Reed suffers

36:52.120 --> 36:53.600
from a number of allergies.

36:53.800 --> 36:58.680
Let's see, dust mites, oak pollen,
tropical grasses.

36:58.920 --> 37:00.520
Oh, here it is.

37:00.720 --> 37:05.400
He's averse to various plant enzymes,
including bromelain.

37:05.640 --> 37:08.000
What does all this have to do
with what he likes to eat?

37:08.240 --> 37:10.880
Over the last several years,
he's been taking regular injections,

37:11.080 --> 37:13.240
so that his body
can tolerate bromelain.

37:13.920 --> 37:16.400
- A plant enzyme.
- Yes.

37:16.640 --> 37:20.840
- Found in...?
- Among other things, pineapple.

37:21.040 --> 37:22.880
Pineapple.

37:23.080 --> 37:24.840
This doesn't mean
it's his favourite food.

37:25.080 --> 37:27.560
It's close enough.
Thank you, doctor.

37:36.840 --> 37:38.600
- It's them.
- Where are they?

37:38.800 --> 37:42.240
Closing from astern, 20,000 metres.

37:42.440 --> 37:45.680
- Fifteen.
- Should I try evasive manoeuvres?

37:45.960 --> 37:49.600
No. Come about,
and hold our position.

37:50.840 --> 37:53.080
Bridge to the armoury.
Guess who's back.

37:53.320 --> 37:54.400
We see them.

37:54.640 --> 37:56.880
Both forward cannons
are charged and ready.

37:57.080 --> 37:59.880
- Get a lock and stand by.
- They've stopped.

38:00.120 --> 38:02.720
- Eleven thousand metres.
- We're being hailed.

38:03.480 --> 38:05.280
Put it through.

38:06.560 --> 38:08.760
- Defenceless.
Prepare to surrender your vessel.

38:08.960 --> 38:10.640
You are defenceless.

38:10.880 --> 38:12.560
- Prepare to surrender.
- Shut it off.

38:12.800 --> 38:14.200
You are defenceless...

38:15.200 --> 38:18.560
Ten thousand metres, nine.

38:18.800 --> 38:20.880
Mr Reed...

38:21.120 --> 38:22.680
...both cannons. Fire.

38:31.920 --> 38:35.800
I'm reading a fluctuation
in their shielding, but it's marginal.

38:36.040 --> 38:39.080
- Five thousand metres.
- Is that the best we can do?

38:39.320 --> 38:41.360
Even if these had been
installed at Jupiter Station,

38:41.600 --> 38:43.760
they wouldn't be any more effective
than they are now.

38:43.960 --> 38:47.000
What about yesterday? You blew up
something the size of Mt McKinley.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.480
Yes, sir, but that was due
to an overload.

38:51.800 --> 38:53.320
Can you overload them again?

38:53.560 --> 38:55.760
Sir, after the damage
from the first time,

38:55.960 --> 38:58.440
the plasma recoil would probably
knock out two decks.

38:58.680 --> 39:00.280
Can you overload them again?

39:00.800 --> 39:02.000
I believe so.

39:02.280 --> 39:04.720
I'd rather knock out two decks
than surrender this ship.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.720
- But, sir...
- Hold on a minute.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.160
- There's a way to handle the recoil.
- How?

39:09.360 --> 39:11.240
All that excess energy's
gotta go somewhere.

39:11.480 --> 39:13.680
- Why not put it to use?
- Three thousand metres.

39:13.920 --> 39:16.240
If we repolarise the gravity plating
to absorb the recoil,

39:16.440 --> 39:18.480
we can shunt the energy
to structural integrity.

39:18.720 --> 39:20.920
- Sounds good to me.
- The grav-plating wasn't designed

39:21.120 --> 39:22.640
to withstand that much force.

39:22.840 --> 39:25.000
We all understand the risks.
Get started.

39:25.200 --> 39:27.000
Aye, sir.

39:32.960 --> 39:35.360
- One thousand metres.
- Malcolm.

39:36.480 --> 39:38.360
Stand by.

39:39.640 --> 39:41.080
Trip.

39:43.080 --> 39:46.000
- We're ready, sir.
- Then fire.

39:58.280 --> 40:01.120
- Their shields are failing.
- Torpedoes.

40:31.880 --> 40:33.720
Bridge to the armoury.

40:33.920 --> 40:35.400
Everything okay down there?

40:35.600 --> 40:37.480
We blew out the plasma relays
on B Deck,

40:37.680 --> 40:41.000
but it's nothing we can't take care of.
What about our friends?

40:41.200 --> 40:45.080
I have a feeling their repairs are
gonna be a little more extensive.

40:45.800 --> 40:48.200
- How'd the cannons hold up?
- Fairly well.

40:48.440 --> 40:50.320
I'll have them back online
within the hour.

40:50.600 --> 40:53.240
The aft cannons should be working
by the end of day tomorrow.

40:53.480 --> 40:55.200
Good work.

40:57.720 --> 40:59.480
Well...

41:01.600 --> 41:06.400
I see no reason for us to go back
to Jupiter Station now.

41:07.280 --> 41:08.760
Do you?

41:08.960 --> 41:10.760
No.

41:10.960 --> 41:13.520
At least there's one good thing
about coming back this far.

41:13.720 --> 41:15.880
We can drop another
subspace amplifier.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.200
Get on it.

41:27.560 --> 41:29.560
Travis...

41:31.080 --> 41:33.320
...resume our previous course.

41:33.520 --> 41:35.760
Gladly, sir.

41:42.280 --> 41:44.000
To our mysterious friends.

41:44.200 --> 41:46.200
I wish I could've seen the looks
on their faces.

41:46.440 --> 41:48.200
Hear, hear.

41:51.480 --> 41:54.400
Don't get too used to
drinking on duty.

41:55.200 --> 41:58.280
But you did your jobs
pretty damn well yesterday.

41:58.760 --> 42:01.080
I'd say that deserves
a little celebration.

42:01.520 --> 42:03.080
Cheers.

42:06.680 --> 42:08.200
If you really wanna thank us,

42:08.400 --> 42:10.680
how about letting us
sleep in tomorrow?

42:12.360 --> 42:14.480
Permission granted.

42:15.240 --> 42:18.840
- Hoshi, what can we do for you?
- Sorry to interrupt, captain.

42:19.040 --> 42:21.440
I have that component
that you asked for.

42:21.720 --> 42:24.200
Great. Put it down right here.

42:26.920 --> 42:29.800
As long as we've got you here,
Malcolm...

42:32.760 --> 42:33.920
...happy birthday.

42:34.120 --> 42:36.760
You shouldn't have gone
to any trouble.

42:36.960 --> 42:38.920
No trouble at all.

42:40.960 --> 42:44.440
Mr Reed, the honour is yours.

42:59.600 --> 43:00.840
Pineapple.

43:01.080 --> 43:02.840
That's my favour...

43:04.240 --> 43:06.320
How on earth did you know?

43:08.560 --> 43:10.280
We have our sources.
