So long as we don't

Number One, she's here.

47:42.550 --> 47:45.300
I am Starfleet Admiral
Jean-Luc Picard,

47:45.500 --> 47:46.820
and the man
you're holding hostage

47:47.020 --> 47:48.700
is Captain William Riker.

Now lower your weapon.

We're here to help you.

What makes you think
I want your help?

47:57.040 --> 48:00.970
Beverly is clearly wounded,
and given that the controls

48:01.170 --> 48:02.750

are on the outside,

48:02.950 --> 48:04.840

helped her inside.

Somebody who cared for her.

call out halfway
across the galaxy

48:25.020 --> 48:26.780
in order to save only herself.

Her son.

you're doing a piss-poor job

48:49.830 --> 48:52.150
<i>- Proximity alert.</i>

48:52.350 --> 48:53.890
