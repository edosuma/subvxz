        Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

00:10.700 --> 00:12.800
     Sam.                       

00:12.900 --> 00:14.200
                    Ha!         

00:14.200 --> 00:15.500
                Doug Aducci.    

00:15.600 --> 00:16.700
        Hey, guys, look at this.

00:16.700 --> 00:17.900
It's Doug Aducci,               

00:17.900 --> 00:20.000
    one of the best damn umpires
         in the American League.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.300
And, uh, Sam here               
was one of the best, uh,        

00:23.400 --> 00:25.600
groomed pitchers                
in the American League, huh?    

00:25.700 --> 00:26.800
SAM:                            
Sit down here.                  

00:26.800 --> 00:27.900
                    God, I can't
                believe this.   

00:27.900 --> 00:29.100
    Last time I saw this guy,   

00:29.200 --> 00:31.500
we were playing                 
the Yankees.                    

00:31.600 --> 00:33.400
You were behind the plate,      
ninth inning.                   

00:33.400 --> 00:35.400
I was on the mound,             
up by one.                      

00:35.500 --> 00:37.500
He calls ball four              
on Munson.                      

00:37.600 --> 00:38.700
Next guy up                     
is Chambliss,                   

00:38.800 --> 00:40.200
knocks one                      
right out of the park.          

00:40.300 --> 00:42.600
Not that I care, man, but,      
you know, that was a strike.    

00:42.700 --> 00:44.600
            No, if I called it a
    ball, it was a ball, Sam.   

00:44.700 --> 00:45.600
(chuckles)                      

00:46.700 --> 00:48.200
It was right                    
at the knees.                   

00:48.200 --> 00:50.400
          It must have been low.

00:50.500 --> 00:53.600
No, no, man, you gave me        
the same pitch on Roy White.    

00:53.600 --> 00:55.900
             That was 1975, Sam.

00:55.900 --> 00:57.300
                It's over.      

00:57.300 --> 00:59.000
The point is that Chambliss     
should never have come up.      

00:59.000 --> 01:02.800
                 Look, Malone, I
            said it was over!   

01:02.800 --> 01:05.400
All I'm asking, Aducci--        
if that's your real name--      

01:05.500 --> 01:07.100
is that you be consistent,      
for God's sake!                 

01:07.100 --> 01:08.600
I mean, that was                
my livelihood!                  

01:08.700 --> 01:09.700
          That's enough, Malone!

01:09.800 --> 01:11.000
                Go get my drink!

01:11.100 --> 01:12.000
Hey, get your own drink!        

01:12.100 --> 01:13.000
                What?!          
     You heard--                

01:13.100 --> 01:14.500
What, are you hard              
of hearing, too?!               

01:14.500 --> 01:16.300
            That's it! You're   
                    out of here!

01:16.300 --> 01:17.500
You'd throw me out              
for that?!                      

01:17.600 --> 01:19.700
                    Take a hike,
              Malone, right now!

01:19.800 --> 01:22.400
I'll take a hike,               
but not before I do this!       

01:22.500 --> 01:25.100
You stupid--                    
I can't believe it!             

01:25.200 --> 01:27.800
    (grunting angrily)          

01:31.000 --> 01:33.200
 Eh, it may have been a strike. 

01:33.300 --> 01:37.100
          I was going           
  through a divorce that year.  

01:37.200 --> 01:39.300

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Morning, everybody.             

02:52.100 --> 02:53.100
              ALL:              
             Norm!              

02:53.100 --> 02:54.900
              Hey, Mr. Peterson,
                      what's up?

02:55.000 --> 02:58.700
The warranty on my liver.       

02:58.700 --> 03:02.300
Oh, Sammy, this town is going   
     down the tubes, I tell you.

03:02.300 --> 03:03.500
Why do you say that?            

03:03.600 --> 03:05.500
        Well, they're installing
        parking meters up there.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.400
      Yeah, I'll have to carry a
      big pocket full of change.

03:08.500 --> 03:11.600
             It's gonna ruin the
            line of my pants.   

03:11.700 --> 03:14.200
Have to go up there every two   
hours, feed the damned meter.   

03:14.300 --> 03:15.400
Well, you want me               

03:15.500 --> 03:17.700
to tell you when two hours      
is up, Mr. P.?                  
                             No,

03:17.800 --> 03:18.700
    I'll know, Woody.           

03:18.800 --> 03:20.900
         Every 87 sips.         

03:21.000 --> 03:22.500
(door opens)                    

03:23.300 --> 03:24.800
I don't accept                  
that, Frasier.                  

03:24.900 --> 03:25.900
This shouldn't                  
be happening.                   

03:25.900 --> 03:27.100
      Well, Lilith, I warned you

03:27.100 --> 03:28.800
            on the night that we
      conceived little Frederick

03:28.900 --> 03:32.200
      that raising a child would
  not be all roses and rainbows.

03:32.300 --> 03:33.400
No, as I recall,                

03:33.500 --> 03:35.800
the exact words you uttered     
that night were,                

03:35.900 --> 03:37.500
"Who cares                      
about the next 20 years?        

03:37.600 --> 03:42.000
Let's get nasty."               

03:42.100 --> 03:44.900
        It's just like you to   
         miss the inner meaning.

03:44.900 --> 03:46.800
         You guys okay?         

03:46.800 --> 03:49.700
      Well, we've just received 
    some very sobering news.    

03:49.800 --> 03:51.100
        Well, you're going to   
         have to feed that meter

03:51.200 --> 03:53.100
             just like everybody
                else, Dr. Crane.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.900
Yes, Woody.                     

03:57.000 --> 04:00.600
Well, the other thing           
that has us so distraught       

04:00.600 --> 04:02.800
is our son's development.       

04:02.900 --> 04:04.300
Frederick is                    
nearly a year old               

04:04.300 --> 04:06.300
and has yet                     
to speak his first word.        

04:06.300 --> 04:08.400
Since we were both              
so concerned,                   

04:08.400 --> 04:11.200
we decided to have our little   
man evaluated by a colleague    

04:11.300 --> 04:13.500
who specializes                 
in child development.           

04:13.600 --> 04:14.700
    Oh. What'd he say?          

04:14.800 --> 04:16.899
                    He confirmed
                our worst fears.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.100
                    Frederick   
                  is... average.

04:20.100 --> 04:22.000
              ALL:              
              Ooh.              

04:22.000 --> 04:23.500
Goodness.                       

04:23.500 --> 04:24.700
It's not funny.                 

04:24.700 --> 04:26.200
             Oh, really, Lilith.

04:26.200 --> 04:30.600
  You didn't expect any sympathy
      here in Mayberry, did you?

04:30.700 --> 04:32.900
Frasier, two people             
as gifted as we are             

04:32.900 --> 04:34.800
were never meant                
to have an average baby.        

04:34.900 --> 04:36.600
It's so unjust.                 

04:36.700 --> 04:38.800
          Well, it's not the end
          of the world, my love.

04:38.800 --> 04:41.300
            So he won't be as   
         erudite as his parents.

04:41.300 --> 04:42.900
             He can still lead a
              happy, normal life

04:43.000 --> 04:44.100
                like the rest   
                of these people.

04:44.100 --> 04:45.200
                          And...

04:45.300 --> 04:47.200
     the new record-- 53!       

04:47.300 --> 04:48.600
                  Yes!          

04:48.700 --> 04:50.400
Yeah.                           

04:50.500 --> 04:52.000
        It's your fault, Lilith!
What?                           

04:52.100 --> 04:54.600
         Yes, obviously you have
          an inferior gene pool.

04:54.700 --> 04:55.800
    Me?                         

04:55.900 --> 04:57.300
                  Well, I didn't
              have a grandfather

04:57.400 --> 04:59.500
            who was a butter and
          egg man in New Jersey.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.800
Mother warned me                
you'd say you love me,          

05:02.900 --> 05:05.900
but sooner or later,            
you'd bring that up.            

05:05.900 --> 05:08.200
Lilith, Lilith, I'm sorry.      

05:08.200 --> 05:10.600
My grandfather wasn't even      
    in America at that time.    

05:10.700 --> 05:12.900
 If he had been, he wouldn't be 
    hawking butter and eggs.    

05:14.200 --> 05:16.500
        Hi, guys.               

05:16.600 --> 05:17.800
                            Hey.
                            Hey.

05:17.900 --> 05:19.200
Oh, hi, Miss Howe.              

05:19.300 --> 05:21.800
You got a letter here           
from Mr. Colcord.               

05:21.900 --> 05:23.200
              Oh, thanks, Woody.

05:23.300 --> 05:24.400
It smells                       
like cinnamon.                  

05:24.500 --> 05:26.500
        Yeah, Robin's working   
              in the bakery now.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.100
                 They put him in
          charge of sticky buns.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.200
                    So what's   
                        the word

05:29.300 --> 05:31.000
from our man                    
in the pokey?                   

05:31.100 --> 05:33.600
                  "Dear Rebecca,

05:33.600 --> 05:35.300
     "I miss you very much.     

05:35.400 --> 05:37.600
"The days go by                 
so slowly here.                 

05:37.700 --> 05:40.900
I lie on my cot                 
and dream about your..."        

05:40.900 --> 05:42.600
Dream about your what?          

05:42.600 --> 05:43.700
Face.                           

05:43.700 --> 05:46.900
My smile,                       
my pleasant demeanor.           

05:46.900 --> 05:48.600
         Come on.               

05:48.600 --> 05:49.600
    What does it say?           

05:49.700 --> 05:51.000
You guys,                       
this is private.                

05:51.100 --> 05:52.900
I don't want                    
to read it to you.              

05:53.000 --> 05:54.500
            I'd be happy with   
                 just the verbs.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.900
          Hey, get a load       
    of this pencil sketch       

05:57.000 --> 05:57.900
          of her demeanor.      

05:58.000 --> 05:59.200
        Ooh.                    

05:59.200 --> 06:01.200
Come on, Carla.                 

06:01.200 --> 06:02.400
How can life be                 
so unfair?                      

06:02.400 --> 06:06.600
      They put this sweet,      
wonderful, dirty man behind bars

06:06.700 --> 06:08.700
    without conjugal visits.    

06:08.800 --> 06:10.000
Three years                     

06:10.100 --> 06:11.400
I saved myself                  
for a man                       

06:11.500 --> 06:13.000
                    and what did
                  I end up with?

06:13.100 --> 06:15.700
                     A two-month
                  window of sex.

06:15.700 --> 06:18.000
Oh, you know, uh, when          
my brother was in the Army,     

06:18.100 --> 06:20.100
he used to visit Amsterdam      
all the time.                   

06:20.200 --> 06:23.800
He said they have a window      
of sex on every block.          

06:26.300 --> 06:29.200
Yeah, I, uh,                    
I saved the letters.            

06:29.300 --> 06:30.800
You might like them,            
Miss Howe.                      

06:31.700 --> 06:34.100
         No thanks, Woody.      

06:34.200 --> 06:36.100
Okay, Miss Howe.                

06:36.100 --> 06:37.800
No hurry on those letters,      
Mr. Clavin.                     

06:43.600 --> 06:46.400
              Frasier, would you
          like to hear my theory

06:46.500 --> 06:48.300
             as to why Frederick
              is not progressing

06:48.400 --> 06:50.100
        as well as he should?   

06:50.200 --> 06:52.300
Something tells me              
I wouldn't, my love.            

06:52.300 --> 06:56.000
Uh, Woody, uh,                  
two more drinks, please.        

06:56.000 --> 06:57.600
            It's both our fault.

06:57.700 --> 07:00.100
                  We don't spend
        enough time with him.   

07:00.100 --> 07:01.500
                  We're too busy
            with our careers.   

07:01.500 --> 07:03.900
            He's being raised   
            by a housekeeper.   

07:03.900 --> 07:06.400
         There is no consistency
                    in his life.

07:06.500 --> 07:07.100
  I agree, Lilith.              

07:07.200 --> 07:08.500
  As you know,                  
  we rarely agree,              

07:08.500 --> 07:10.500
as you're a behaviorist         
and I'm a strict Freudian,      

07:10.600 --> 07:12.000
but it does make                

07:12.000 --> 07:14.900
for some, some, some hot,       
angry sex in the boudoir.       

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
                    I don't have
                    to tell you.

07:16.100 --> 07:18.200
                    (laughs)    

07:18.300 --> 07:20.700
I wish you hadn't.              

07:21.800 --> 07:24.100
            Let's face facts.   

07:24.200 --> 07:25.700
            We should let the   
                 housekeeper go.

07:25.800 --> 07:28.500
        One of us should be with
         our child at all times.

07:29.400 --> 07:31.300
            The only question   
                  is: Which one?

07:31.400 --> 07:32.700
Well, you, of course.           

07:32.800 --> 07:33.800
              Why me, of course?

07:33.900 --> 07:35.200
          Because I'm the woman?

07:35.300 --> 07:37.600
        Why is the man's work   
automatically more important?   

07:37.700 --> 07:38.700
                I'm making great
                breakthroughs   

07:38.800 --> 07:39.800
                in my current   
            research project.   

07:39.800 --> 07:40.900
Yes, well,                      

07:41.000 --> 07:42.800
damn me to an eternity          
driving a Yugo,                 

07:42.900 --> 07:44.300
but I make                      
more money than you.            

07:44.300 --> 07:47.600
    I write more books in one   
    year than you read, Frasier.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.300
Yes, well,                      
I have many degrees.            

07:50.300 --> 07:51.300
         Hey, hold it.          

07:51.300 --> 07:52.700
      I-I'll settle this.       

07:52.700 --> 07:55.900
  Let's pick an arbitrary way   
     to make the decision.      

07:55.900 --> 07:58.800
     All right, whoever has     
 the most freckles on their arm 

07:58.900 --> 07:59.800
stays home with the baby.       

07:59.900 --> 08:01.500
    (sighs)                     

08:01.500 --> 08:03.300
            I think that's an   
        excellent way to choose.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.300
Oh, you would say that.         

08:04.400 --> 08:07.400
You have no pigmentation        
in your skin.                   

08:07.500 --> 08:10.000
            For God's sake, what
        are we arguing about?   

08:10.100 --> 08:12.200
                 Who should stay
            home with our child?

08:12.300 --> 08:14.200
          It's not a punishment,
                  it's an honor.

08:14.300 --> 08:15.500
                  I'd love to.  

08:15.600 --> 08:18.600
        I'd be delighted to stay
      home and nurture my child.

08:18.600 --> 08:21.300
Oh, Lilith, you role-play       
the mother so well.             

08:21.400 --> 08:22.600
                If we can't make
                    a commitment

08:22.600 --> 08:24.700
            to be with our child
        at all cost, who can?   

08:24.800 --> 08:26.000
    I agree.                    

08:26.100 --> 08:27.800
The most important thing        
is to be with Frederick         

08:27.800 --> 08:29.100
during his formative years.     

08:29.200 --> 08:30.400
Say, I have a thought.          

08:30.500 --> 08:32.299
In celebration                  
of this realization,            

08:32.400 --> 08:34.799
we'll have dinner together      
tonight, just the two of us.    

08:34.900 --> 08:36.299
                  And Frederick.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.299
      Of course.                

08:37.299 --> 08:38.600
Oh, oh,                         
did you want to come?           

08:38.700 --> 08:40.100
     (laughs)                   

08:45.600 --> 08:48.200
  Afternoon <i>again,</i> everybody.   

08:48.300 --> 08:49.800
              ALL:              
             Norm!              

08:49.800 --> 08:51.200
What'll you have                
this time, Norm?                

08:51.200 --> 08:54.900
A cow, if I have to climb       
  those stairs one more time.   

08:54.900 --> 08:56.600
              I am sick of this.

08:56.600 --> 09:00.700
    Every two hours, it's up the
  stairs and down to the corner,

09:00.800 --> 09:03.000
      over to the meter, put the
        coin, down the stairs...

09:03.000 --> 09:04.100
At least you're getting         
exercise, huh, Mr. Peterson?    

09:04.200 --> 09:06.000
    I get my exercise, Woody.   

09:06.100 --> 09:08.800
    What, do you think          
  I just hop off the bar stool  

09:08.800 --> 09:11.000
 and bam-- there's a bathroom?  

09:11.100 --> 09:12.500
              No.               

09:12.500 --> 09:15.700
          N-No, n-n-no, it's way
        down the hall, Woody.   

09:15.800 --> 09:18.000
SAM:                            
Hey, Rebecca.                   

09:18.100 --> 09:19.800
    Total up those receipts     
        from last night?        

09:19.900 --> 09:22.100
Rebecca!                        

09:22.200 --> 09:23.200
                         Huh?   

09:23.300 --> 09:24.400
    Receipts.                   

09:24.500 --> 09:26.100
                     Oh. No.    

09:26.200 --> 09:28.000
Well, it's 3:00.                

09:28.100 --> 09:29.600
What have you been              
doing all day?                  

09:29.700 --> 09:31.700
          I've been writing this
        reply to Robin's letter.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.800
Oh, come-- hey, write that      
on your own time,               

09:33.900 --> 09:34.800
will you,                       
for goodness' sake?             

09:34.900 --> 09:36.300
How are you going               
to get work done                

09:36.400 --> 09:37.900
if all you do                   
is think about sex?             

09:38.000 --> 09:39.700
              I don't know, Sam.
            How do you do it?   

09:41.800 --> 09:44.100
I'm a boy, it's my job.         

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
                  Fine, I'll get
                  your receipts.

09:48.100 --> 09:48.900
                      (chuckles)
Sam, don't you think            

09:49.100 --> 09:50.700
you were a little tough         
on Miss Howe?                   

09:50.700 --> 09:52.500
I mean,                         
she's hardly ever happy.        

09:52.600 --> 09:53.700
So what                         
if she was late                 

09:53.800 --> 09:56.100
totaling up                     
some dumb old receipts?         

09:57.400 --> 09:58.100
         Oh, maybe you're right.

09:58.100 --> 10:00.300
Maybe I was                     
a little tough on her.          

10:00.300 --> 10:01.900
        Sam, is this all the    
              vermouth we have? 

10:02.000 --> 10:03.500
Yeah, Rebecca was supposed      
to order some more.             

10:03.600 --> 10:04.800
She probably forgot.            

10:04.900 --> 10:06.500
                 Oh, well, now, 
              that's just tops. 

10:06.600 --> 10:10.500
    Hey, Miss Howe, you were    
supposed to order more vermouth!

10:10.500 --> 10:11.900
        We pay you              
     for an eight-hour day,     

10:12.000 --> 10:15.700
     we expect eight hours!     

10:15.800 --> 10:18.600
    Sometimes I wonder, Sam,    
    what are they thinking?     

10:20.800 --> 10:22.900
Good afternoon, everyone.       

10:23.000 --> 10:25.200
  Sam, just a quick iced tea.   

10:25.200 --> 10:27.600
I've got my obsessive-compulsive
     group to preside over.     

10:27.700 --> 10:29.100
        You can imagine         
     how punctual they are.     

10:29.100 --> 10:30.200
                            SAM:
                             Ha.

10:30.300 --> 10:31.600
    What time does it start?    

10:31.700 --> 10:32.600
Well,                           

10:32.700 --> 10:34.300
             now.               

10:34.300 --> 10:35.300
Boy, the next 15 minutes        

10:35.400 --> 10:36.800
are really going                
to drive them bonkers.          

10:36.900 --> 10:40.000
But that's exactly              
what they need.                 

10:40.100 --> 10:41.500
                      Dr. Crane,
                        I've got

10:41.500 --> 10:44.300
              some messages here
            from Mrs. Dr. Crane.

10:44.400 --> 10:45.200
        Yes, Woody?             
                      Yes, well,

10:45.300 --> 10:46.500
                      she called
                          to say

10:46.500 --> 10:48.200
         she thinks Freddy might
              have a diaper rash

10:48.300 --> 10:51.200
              and she can't find
             the A & D Ointment.

10:51.300 --> 10:53.700
     And then she called back to
     say she found the ointment,

10:53.800 --> 10:55.900
          but would it be better
        to use talcum powder?   

10:56.000 --> 10:57.500
        Mm-hmm.                 

10:57.600 --> 10:59.000
             And then she called
         back to say never mind,

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
        she's just gonna, uh,   
            leave the diaper off

11:01.100 --> 11:05.200
              and let Freddy air
          out his little bottom.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.600
             And then she called
                one last time   

11:06.700 --> 11:08.600
                to ask where the
              carpet cleaner is.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.500
      Oh, my God.               

11:12.600 --> 11:13.800
                            SAM:
                Everything okay?

11:14.500 --> 11:15.400
  Oh, everything's fine, Sam.   

11:15.500 --> 11:17.200
          We just made          
     one horrible mistake.      

11:17.300 --> 11:18.200
What's that?                    

11:18.300 --> 11:20.700
    We left the child alone     
        with its mother.        

11:25.700 --> 11:26.900
    Carla, you got a minute?    

11:27.000 --> 11:28.200
    What do you need, Becks?    

11:28.300 --> 11:30.100
I'm trying to write             
an appropriate reply            

11:30.100 --> 11:32.000
to Robin's letter.              

11:32.000 --> 11:35.800
 Well, I don't seem to be able  
     to... express myself.      

11:35.800 --> 11:37.900
                You want to send
                a "Smut-O-Gram."

11:38.000 --> 11:39.300
And I was wondering             
if you could help me            

11:39.400 --> 11:43.600
since you're the closest thing  
to a sailor I know.             

11:43.700 --> 11:48.200
         Step into my office and
        rejoice in the filth.   

11:48.300 --> 11:51.600
All right, so this              
is what I've got so far.        

11:51.700 --> 11:54.900
"Dear Robin, I am writing you   
this letter while lying...      

11:55.000 --> 11:57.400
    naked in the tub."          

11:57.400 --> 11:59.200
      Let me just stop you      
          right there.          

12:00.500 --> 12:02.800
  "I'm writing you this letter  

12:02.900 --> 12:06.200
    while lying naked           
     on my kitchen table."      

12:07.100 --> 12:09.500
        Whoa!                   

12:09.500 --> 12:11.300
That is good.                   

12:11.400 --> 12:12.900
             Well, there's a lot
                more depth to me

12:13.000 --> 12:16.800
            than just being a   
             waitress, you know.

12:16.900 --> 12:17.800
    Okay.                       

12:17.900 --> 12:19.100
"Just thinking of you           
makes me hot.                   

12:19.200 --> 12:22.800
It..."                          
Oh, no, no, no, no, not hot, no.

12:22.900 --> 12:23.800
          Write this.           

12:23.900 --> 12:25.300
Okay.                           

12:25.400 --> 12:26.600
         "I'm on fire."         

12:26.600 --> 12:27.500
          Fire.                 

12:27.600 --> 12:30.800
                  "I'm churning,
                    I'm burning.

12:30.900 --> 12:33.400
              "I want something,
                    anything.   

12:33.400 --> 12:37.200
"I reach for a piece of fruit-- 

12:37.300 --> 12:41.700
"an orange, a ripe orange,      

12:41.700 --> 12:43.800
                 "big and sweet.

12:43.900 --> 12:46.500
                    "I peel back
                     the skin...

12:46.600 --> 12:48.000
            "slowly.            

12:48.100 --> 12:50.600
      "My fingernails tear      
         into the pulp.         

12:50.700 --> 12:51.700
The juice runs down my"...      

12:51.800 --> 12:53.700
You know, that orange           
isn't going to work             

12:53.800 --> 12:57.100
because the juice burns         
his ulcers.                     

12:57.100 --> 12:58.300
                 Oh!            

12:58.300 --> 13:01.600
Look, if you're not going       
to get into the spirit          

13:01.700 --> 13:04.700
of soft porn,                   
just forget about it.           

13:04.800 --> 13:07.100
    No, Carla, you're right.    

13:07.200 --> 13:08.400
    I know. Who am I fooling?   

13:08.500 --> 13:10.400
    I can't write this stuff.   

13:10.500 --> 13:13.100
         Besides, what good     
         is a dirty letter?     

13:13.100 --> 13:16.900
        Just fun words          
        on a piece of paper.    

13:17.000 --> 13:17.900
You know,                       
you're right.                   

13:18.000 --> 13:19.800
You need your man.              

13:19.900 --> 13:22.000
We got to sneak you             
into that prison                

13:22.000 --> 13:23.800
so you can get what you need.   

13:23.900 --> 13:25.600
        Oh, that's a great idea.

13:25.700 --> 13:27.000
Yeah, let's go.                 
          Oh, but wait a minute,

13:27.100 --> 13:28.900
          wait a minute, I don't
     know which cell is Robin's.

13:28.900 --> 13:30.600
        How will we find him?   

13:30.600 --> 13:31.800
  It has to be Robin?           

13:33.600 --> 13:36.400
Th-There's lots of guys         
in there.                       

13:36.400 --> 13:38.300
You might find someone          
you like better.                

13:38.400 --> 13:41.000
Come on.                        

13:41.100 --> 13:43.700
It's a minimum                  
security prison.                

13:43.700 --> 13:45.100
How hard could it be?           

13:45.100 --> 13:47.300
I mean you're allowed to visit  
him anytime you want, right?    

13:47.400 --> 13:48.300
                     Yeah.      

13:48.400 --> 13:49.400
So what you do                  

13:49.500 --> 13:51.700
                is you find some
                  secluded spot.

13:51.800 --> 13:53.900
Oh, you know, the garden area   
is usually deserted.            

13:53.900 --> 13:54.900
                Great, great.   

13:54.900 --> 13:56.000
                I'll stand watch

13:56.100 --> 13:58.300
        and you can stay with   
        him as long as you want.

13:58.400 --> 13:59.700
Oh, it shouldn't take long.     

13:59.800 --> 14:02.900
      He's English.             

14:03.000 --> 14:05.500
Sam, we're going to be gone     
for a couple hours.             

14:05.600 --> 14:09.000
                Girl stuff.     

14:09.000 --> 14:10.900
              Girl stuff? Why do
        they always say that?   

14:10.900 --> 14:12.900
            What does that mean?

14:15.700 --> 14:19.400
             Oh, Sam, I didn't  
            want to know that.  

14:21.400 --> 14:24.200
        Greetings, all.         

14:24.200 --> 14:26.100
The boys are out                
for an adventure.               

14:26.200 --> 14:27.800
                            SAM:
                        Hey-hey!

14:27.900 --> 14:29.800
I'm glad to see you guys.       

14:29.900 --> 14:32.000
Has the little dude said        
his first word yet?             

14:32.100 --> 14:33.300
      Well, I thought so,       

14:33.300 --> 14:35.300
but then I checked my unabridged
Oxford English dictionary       

14:35.300 --> 14:37.400
        and I was unable        
    to find the word "gak."     

14:39.000 --> 14:40.900
Sam, may I have a beer,         
please,                         

14:40.900 --> 14:44.000
and could you warm up this      
formula for my little angel?    

14:44.100 --> 14:45.700
    (Frederick crying)          

14:45.800 --> 14:46.900
Oh, pipe down!                  

14:46.900 --> 14:48.500
                 You saw me give
              the bottle to Sam.

14:48.600 --> 14:50.900
        Does, does water just   
             boil instantly? No!

14:51.000 --> 14:52.800
         He'll warm it,         
      then you'll get it!       

14:52.900 --> 14:56.100
And it'll be                    
yum-yum-yum-yum-yum.            

14:58.400 --> 15:00.000
So, uh...                       

15:00.000 --> 15:01.200
going a little rough there,     
Dr. Mom?                        

15:01.300 --> 15:02.800
                     Well, let's
                        just say

15:02.900 --> 15:06.300
  that since I have become the  
primary caregiver to Frederick, 

15:06.400 --> 15:08.900
I have a newfound respect       
for those who have decided      

15:09.000 --> 15:10.400
          to stay home          
    and dedicate their lives    

15:10.400 --> 15:11.600
         to the raising         
    of their children.          

15:11.700 --> 15:13.000
                     I have also
                        realized

15:13.000 --> 15:14.800
    that if I were to do it     
    for any amount of time,     

15:14.900 --> 15:17.100
  you would soon hear stories   
 of me sitting naked in a tower 

15:17.200 --> 15:20.200
with a high-powered rifle.      

15:20.200 --> 15:21.300
CLIFF:                          
Oh, yeah.                       

15:21.400 --> 15:22.600
                    See, as a   
                 rule, your, uh,

15:22.700 --> 15:26.300
                  psycho killers
            don't have families.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.100
              Nah, they're, uh, 
                they're loners. 

15:28.200 --> 15:30.100
    They may have jobs, they're 
         good to their mothers, 

15:30.200 --> 15:31.700
              but, by and large,

15:31.800 --> 15:34.500
              they sit alone at 
          night in a dark room, 

15:34.500 --> 15:36.600
         writing their depraved 
        thoughts in a diary.    

15:36.700 --> 15:39.800
Cliffie, you keep a diary,      
don't you?                      

15:42.400 --> 15:45.200
            I, uh,              
    keep a journal, Norm.       

15:45.200 --> 15:47.700
        A journal!              

15:51.900 --> 15:55.300
      So does Lilith know       
    you guys are over here?     

15:55.400 --> 15:57.900
    Oh, yes, of course, Sam.    

15:58.000 --> 16:00.200
      I told her that I was just
    taking our 11-month-old baby

16:00.300 --> 16:01.500
      out for a tall one.       

16:02.900 --> 16:05.800
          The irony is          
 I got myself into this pickle. 

16:05.900 --> 16:08.600
I convinced Lilith that with my 
background and clinical skills, 

16:08.600 --> 16:11.000
  I should be the one to take   
primary care of the child,      

16:11.100 --> 16:12.100
            not her.            

16:12.200 --> 16:14.000
        Naturally,              
    she took it personally.     

16:14.100 --> 16:16.200
I was somehow denigrating       
  her competency as a mother.   

16:16.300 --> 16:19.500
    Boy, you look cross-eyed    
    at a woman these days...    

16:19.600 --> 16:21.800
 So she <i>does</i> know you're here?  

16:21.800 --> 16:23.100
         Well, no, no.          

16:23.100 --> 16:25.900
  I didn't fill her in on our   
 itinerary for the entire day,  

16:25.900 --> 16:28.100
     but she won't question     
          my judgment.          

16:28.200 --> 16:30.100
    I have assumed complete     
  responsibility for the child  

16:30.200 --> 16:32.400
 and I see no problem with him  
being in this environment.      

16:32.400 --> 16:33.900
                      Hey, look,

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
with a cigar in his hand,       
he looks just like Baby Herman. 

16:43.700 --> 16:46.100
If Lilith calls, we're not here.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.500
Your Colcord                    
should be out here.             

16:56.600 --> 16:59.400
                        REBECCA:
                     Oh, my God.

16:59.500 --> 17:00.800
                    The whole   
                  prison's here.

17:00.900 --> 17:02.200
What's going on?                

17:02.300 --> 17:03.600
It's one                        
of our inmate's birthdays--     

17:03.700 --> 17:05.099
Congressman Bailor.             

17:05.099 --> 17:07.099
        He's hosting a little   
        barbecue for the men.   

17:07.200 --> 17:08.700
                He's from Texas,
                    you know.   

17:08.800 --> 17:10.800
                     Oh, man.   

17:10.900 --> 17:13.000
          I don't think I can go
         through with this here.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.800
         The thought of a lot of
people being a few feet away,   

17:15.900 --> 17:18.099
              and somebody could
      discover us at any minute.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.400
What, you're saying that        
like it's a bad thing.          

17:20.400 --> 17:21.900
                Part of me wants
                    to stay here

17:22.000 --> 17:23.800
              and the other part
             of me wants to run.

17:25.599 --> 17:27.300
All of me wants                 
to strip down,                  

17:27.400 --> 17:31.300
lay on the grass,               
and yell, "Fumble!"             

17:31.400 --> 17:33.800
                      All right.

17:33.900 --> 17:35.600
             I've come this far.

17:35.700 --> 17:38.800
It wasn't the bad investments   
that ruined my S & L,           

17:38.800 --> 17:41.400
             it was             
  the free checking accounts.   

17:41.500 --> 17:43.500
                    Robin! Whoo!

17:43.500 --> 17:44.900
Rebecca,                        
what a surprise.                

17:45.000 --> 17:45.900
      Hello.                    

17:46.000 --> 17:47.200
Oh, have you met                
the boys?                       

17:47.300 --> 17:49.600
            No, but I've seen   
            all of you on TV.   

17:49.700 --> 17:53.000
     Yeah, uh, boys, would you  
    excuse us for a moment?     

17:53.100 --> 17:54.100
        Darling.                

17:54.200 --> 17:55.500
                    Robin, I got
                    your letter.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.900
Oh, yeah,                       
I hope I didn't go too far.     

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
                    Did you mean
            everything you said?

17:58.100 --> 17:59.300
  Every word.                   

17:59.400 --> 18:01.500
And those little drawings       
in the margin, yeah.            

18:01.600 --> 18:04.100
            Then I have got a   
            surprise for you.   

18:04.100 --> 18:07.600
        Rebecca, wh-- there's   
          a party going on here.

18:07.700 --> 18:10.300
                    Uh, darling.

18:10.400 --> 18:11.400
                      Aah!      

18:11.500 --> 18:12.900
Rebecca,                        
darling, darling.               

18:12.900 --> 18:14.300
                No, no, no.     

18:14.400 --> 18:16.900
W-W-We, we can't.               
It's not-- no, no, it's okay.   

18:16.900 --> 18:18.800
     It's okay, no one will see.

18:18.900 --> 18:21.100
     Carla's right over there on
  the other side standing guard.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.700
            (laughs)            

18:23.700 --> 18:25.800
Settle down, boys, settle down. 

18:25.900 --> 18:28.300
Darling, darling,               
darling, you know--             

18:28.300 --> 18:29.900
you know I want you             
more than anything,             

18:30.000 --> 18:31.500
but we just                     
can't take the chance.          

18:31.600 --> 18:32.600
                            Why?

18:32.600 --> 18:34.200
                 I can be quiet.

18:34.300 --> 18:35.500
(chuckling):                    
Quiet, no, no.                  

18:35.600 --> 18:37.100
No, it's, it's not that--       

18:37.200 --> 18:38.100
and I'd feel insulted           
if you were--                   

18:38.100 --> 18:41.400
but I've just heard             
wonderful news.                 

18:41.400 --> 18:43.300
I'm up for early parole         
next month.                     

18:43.400 --> 18:44.500
                Oh! That's good!

18:44.600 --> 18:45.900
You see,                        
so I can't do anything          

18:46.000 --> 18:47.100
that would jeopardize that,     

18:47.200 --> 18:50.000
um, and, well, this is one      
of the few rules, and, um,      

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
you know,                       
while I, I burn for you,        

18:52.100 --> 18:53.900
I must adhere to it             
or I'll be here                 

18:53.900 --> 18:55.100
for another year.               

18:55.100 --> 18:58.400
Now, you do understand that,    
don't you?                      

18:58.400 --> 19:00.100
                    Sure, I do. 

19:00.200 --> 19:03.200
         You don't want to be in
          jail for another year.

19:03.300 --> 19:06.200
                  But what about
                      my needs?!

19:07.200 --> 19:10.100
                    Carla, we're
                    out of here!

19:10.200 --> 19:11.300
(men groaning)                  

19:14.200 --> 19:16.600
Gee whiz, Cliff,                
why don't you give it up?       

19:16.700 --> 19:17.600
It's been an hour.              

19:17.700 --> 19:20.100
Let's let Frederick             
have a chance.                  

19:20.200 --> 19:22.000
                 No, if he wants
                to play with it,

19:22.100 --> 19:23.500
    let him ask me himself.     

19:25.400 --> 19:28.000
        Cliff, you know         
      he can't speak yet.       

19:28.100 --> 19:31.200
     And what a cruel irony     
         that you can.          

19:32.400 --> 19:34.500
SAM:                            
Norm.                           

19:34.500 --> 19:36.500
It's 5:00,                      
time to feed the meter.         

19:36.600 --> 19:38.900
                     Yeah, yeah,
            yeah, yeah, yeah.   

19:38.900 --> 19:40.700
      I have had it, Sam.       

19:40.800 --> 19:43.500
    No more of this climbing    
 up the stairs every two hours. 

19:43.600 --> 19:44.600
                      You're not
                      leaving me

19:44.600 --> 19:46.400
for another bar, are you?       

19:46.400 --> 19:49.000
            Oh, no,             
I'm going to sell my car.       

19:49.100 --> 19:50.900
                        FRASIER:
                5:00 already?   

19:51.000 --> 19:53.600
We've been here all day.        

19:53.700 --> 19:55.100
Time to get the little guy home,
        huh, Dr. Crane?         

19:55.200 --> 19:56.300
                        Well,   

19:56.300 --> 19:58.100
Lilith doesn't get home         
until 6:00.                     

19:58.100 --> 19:59.300
Say, darts, anyone?             

19:59.400 --> 20:00.400
              Paul?             
Yeah, sure.                     

20:00.500 --> 20:01.500
    Cliff, you coming?          

20:01.500 --> 20:02.700
                  Uh, yeah, I'll
                 be right there.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.100
        (grunts angrily)        

20:04.100 --> 20:06.900
      This thing's harder       
  than the civil service exam.  

20:09.900 --> 20:12.800
     What a waste.              

20:12.900 --> 20:13.800
                     Not for me.

20:13.900 --> 20:16.000
                  I got 15 dates
                    lined up.   

20:16.100 --> 20:19.200
              Of course, none of
          them start for a year.

20:19.200 --> 20:22.900
I got no romance,               
no satisfaction, no nothing.    

20:23.000 --> 20:25.200
              Come on, you don't
                have nothing.   

20:25.300 --> 20:26.800
                 You got a purse
                full of ribs.   

20:26.900 --> 20:27.800
          What?                 
                      Sure.     

20:27.900 --> 20:29.600
              I took the liberty
              of filling you up.

20:29.700 --> 20:33.500
             The sauce is in the
             change compartment.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.400
                  Hey, cheer up.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.900
             He said he'd be out
          in a couple of months.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.600
     Yeah, sure, so what am     
  I supposed to do until then?  

20:40.700 --> 20:41.800
                  Tell you what.

20:41.900 --> 20:44.700
  There's, uh, some construction
        workers down the street.

20:44.700 --> 20:46.800
                  What about you
              and I go cruising?

20:46.800 --> 20:48.100
    (chuckles)                  

20:48.100 --> 20:50.400
No, I can't cheat               
on Robin.                       

20:50.500 --> 20:53.700
          Man, I thought we were
              going to be close.

20:53.700 --> 20:55.800
  Well, maybe it wouldn't hurt  

20:55.900 --> 21:00.600
 if we just paraded around them 
and frustrate them a little bit.

21:00.600 --> 21:01.800
         There you go.          

21:01.900 --> 21:03.300
Let's do it.                    
            All right.          

21:03.400 --> 21:06.600
Let's spread                    
the pain around.                

21:06.700 --> 21:08.000
Where are you guys going?       

21:08.000 --> 21:10.700
             BOTH:              
          Girl stuff.           

21:10.700 --> 21:12.400
                Ick!            

21:12.500 --> 21:13.400
(door opens)                    

21:14.500 --> 21:16.900
          Hello, Sam.           

21:17.000 --> 21:18.700
          Hey, Lilith.          

21:18.800 --> 21:21.300
Query: If I had a problem       

21:21.300 --> 21:23.500
and needed to talk              
to someone about it,            

21:23.500 --> 21:25.400
would it be perpetuating        
a stereotype                    

21:25.400 --> 21:27.800
to actually select              
a bartender?                    

21:27.900 --> 21:29.000
    Well, that, that depends.   

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
On what?                        

21:30.000 --> 21:31.500
          On what you just said.

21:33.600 --> 21:36.100
I feel like a failure--         

21:36.200 --> 21:39.300
a failure as a mother,          
ergo as a woman and a person.   

21:40.700 --> 21:43.700
Do you make a drink             
for failures here at Cheers?    

21:43.700 --> 21:45.500
    Uh, hold on a sec-- Phil,   
          what are you drinking?

21:45.600 --> 21:46.500
          A Manhattan.          

21:46.600 --> 21:48.500
                      Manhattan.

21:53.200 --> 21:55.100
                    You know,   

21:55.200 --> 21:57.600
          sweetheart,           
    I'd bet my bottom dollar    

21:57.600 --> 21:59.500
 that you're a pretty good mom. 

21:59.600 --> 22:02.900
Yes, well, considering          
that endorsement comes          

22:03.000 --> 22:04.400
from a perennial Peter Pan      

22:04.400 --> 22:06.000
with no sense                   
of maturity                     

22:06.100 --> 22:09.300
or obligation, you'll excuse me 
 if I don't leap over the bar,  

22:09.300 --> 22:11.000
embrace you,                    
and say, "Really, Sam?          

22:11.100 --> 22:12.800
     You think so?"             

22:12.800 --> 22:16.200
              Well, glad I could
            be there for you.   

22:16.200 --> 22:18.100
I'm sorry.                      

22:18.100 --> 22:19.800
    Perhaps I'm just bitter     

22:19.900 --> 22:22.900
 because Frasier is succeeding  
  with our son where I failed.  

22:22.900 --> 22:24.400
He is indeed                    
a better influence              

22:24.400 --> 22:26.900
      on my precious baby.      

22:26.900 --> 22:28.400
Hey, guess what, everybody?     

22:28.500 --> 22:30.400
Little Frederick                
beat Cliff at darts.            

22:30.400 --> 22:32.800
         Frasier!               

22:32.900 --> 22:34.700
             Uh-oh.             
What are you doing here?        

22:34.800 --> 22:38.600
  I didn't give my son to you   
      so you could run off      

22:38.700 --> 22:40.300
and spend the day               
in a bawdy house.               

22:40.300 --> 22:42.200
            Yes, well, my, my   
        little chopped salad,   

22:42.300 --> 22:45.700
    I mean, we just got here,   
          what, ten minutes ago.

22:45.800 --> 22:47.200
You're lying.                   

22:47.300 --> 22:49.700
                  Well, yes, I'm
            lying, but, uh...   

22:49.700 --> 22:51.600
      I-I thought that Frederick
            might enjoy himself.

22:51.700 --> 22:53.400
Enjoy himself                   
in a bar?                       

22:53.500 --> 22:54.900
He's 11 months old.             

22:54.900 --> 22:57.100
What kind of values             
can he learn here?              

22:57.100 --> 23:00.100
        Well, I-I thought the   
    place had a lot to offer.   

23:00.100 --> 23:03.400
Oh, please, he'll never learn   
to speak in this environment.   

23:03.500 --> 23:05.200
     Afternoon, everybody.      

23:05.300 --> 23:06.900
     Norm!                      

23:17.100 --> 23:19.700
      He said "Mommy."          

23:20.305 --> 23:26.410
