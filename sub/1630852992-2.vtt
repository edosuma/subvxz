WEBVTT

00:06.924 --> 00:11.512
I think
it's a very interesting time to be alive.

00:14.306 --> 00:18.894
We're coming through a social
and racial awakening and reckoning.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.395
Stop Asian hate!

00:20.479 --> 00:24.107
We are voicing our reality,

00:25.317 --> 00:28.445
the fear, for the first time.

00:28.529 --> 00:32.573
To quote the great Sandra Oh,
"It's an honor to be Asian!"

00:33.158 --> 00:34.368
Dear Sandra...

00:34.451 --> 00:35.536
Dear Sandra...

00:35.619 --> 00:36.620
Dear Sandra...

00:36.703 --> 00:39.706
The more I learned about you,
the more inspired I became.

00:39.790 --> 00:43.877
I know I would not be
the artist that I am,

00:43.961 --> 00:47.130
but for every single challenge
that has come before me.

00:47.214 --> 00:48.590
Thank you, Sandra.

00:48.674 --> 00:49.675
Thank you, Sandra.

00:49.758 --> 00:52.678
You've blazed a trail,
and you continue to lead the way.

00:53.846 --> 00:56.557
How truthfully you are meeting a moment

00:57.558 --> 01:00.561
can have profound ripple effects.

01:01.311 --> 01:02.896
Dear Sandra...

01:30.424 --> 01:33.093
I grew up in a small town
outside of Ottawa,

01:33.177 --> 01:35.220
which is the capital of Canada.

01:35.304 --> 01:37.890
I had a good childhood. I really did.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.392
And I had a very typical

01:40.475 --> 01:44.062
kind of first-generation
Korean immigrant upbringing.

01:45.522 --> 01:49.776
As a kid, my mother always complained
that I had too much energy,

01:50.485 --> 01:53.739
that I was bouncing around at all moments.

01:55.324 --> 01:58.452
Just a little--
a little bigger than life. A little extra.

01:58.535 --> 02:01.747
I think every single picture of me
was like...

02:05.751 --> 02:08.169
I started performing
when I was about four.

02:08.252 --> 02:12.257
My mother was very concerned
that I had pigeon-toed feet.

02:12.966 --> 02:16.053
So she put me in dancing
that usually brings them out.

02:16.136 --> 02:19.890
And I think a lot of my energy--
I found a focus.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.059
I'm just really a failed dancer.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.478
I'm just really a wannabe dancer.

02:26.855 --> 02:31.151
When I was in high school, I found acting.

02:32.236 --> 02:34.905
When I found the drama club,

02:34.988 --> 02:37.157
there was a sense of communion.

02:37.241 --> 02:41.036
That's the thing
that you end up dedicating your life to.

02:41.954 --> 02:43.372
I just wanted to act.

02:44.790 --> 02:48.669
But growing up in Canada
in the '70s and '80s,

02:48.752 --> 02:53.590
it was limited in seeing kind of
representation of Asian American actors.

02:54.716 --> 02:58.887
There was no one to point to, to be able
to say, "Oh, look, this person has this

02:58.971 --> 03:02.516
and this person does this, and look what
it does for our community," let's say.

03:02.599 --> 03:03.892
That's not happening.

03:03.976 --> 03:07.062
But for me, there was Connie Chung.

03:07.145 --> 03:08.856
Good evening. General Manuel Noriega...

03:08.939 --> 03:10.357
A woman who's of Asian descent,

03:10.440 --> 03:13.569
who was speaking the news,
who was in a position of power.

03:14.152 --> 03:18.240
I think I had
and knew from that early age,

03:18.323 --> 03:22.160
understanding the significance
and the need to be up there.

03:22.744 --> 03:26.123
And the drive that I had to be an artist

03:26.206 --> 03:29.334
gave me a lot of confidence.

03:30.002 --> 03:32.838
So I applied
to the National Theatre School.

03:33.839 --> 03:36.216
My parents were not approving.

03:36.967 --> 03:40.846
Classic Korean immigrants, very academic.

03:41.597 --> 03:44.308
And they wanted me to go
to a university, at least.

03:45.309 --> 03:47.477
Being an actor was frowned upon.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.647
But ultimately,

03:51.481 --> 03:54.359
it didn't really matter
what anyone else said.

03:56.653 --> 03:59.531
Once I entered
the National Theatre School,

04:00.199 --> 04:02.492
I got great training there,

04:02.576 --> 04:04.745
because it was so immersive

04:04.828 --> 04:08.123
that you can explore
different types of training.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.709
The rejection of your parents

04:11.919 --> 04:15.339
actually becomes great fodder.

04:17.466 --> 04:21.970
I wanted to do something to show them,
so they understood me.

04:23.347 --> 04:26.391
I remember actually auditioning
for my first film

04:26.475 --> 04:27.935
my second year of school.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.978
I remember like I can feel it now.

04:30.562 --> 04:33.065
And my sister lives in Vancouver,

04:33.148 --> 04:35.817
and there's a newspaper,
a local newspaper,

04:35.901 --> 04:39.029
and in it,
a friend of hers cut out this thing

04:39.112 --> 04:42.991
where it's like a newspaper advert,
"Young Asian actresses wanted."

04:43.075 --> 04:44.535
And then I...

04:45.369 --> 04:47.704
went after it. I went after it.

04:49.957 --> 04:54.044
I remember sneaking out
from theater school

04:54.127 --> 04:56.421
and getting on a bus
from Montreal to Toronto.

04:58.799 --> 05:03.720
In this audition,
there's very, very emotional scenes.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.848
And I didn't know how to audition.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.642
I remember going to the casting director,

05:08.725 --> 05:11.186
"Okay. So now I'm just gonna lie down.

05:11.270 --> 05:14.523
Just hold my hand. And then,
when I squeeze your hand, I'll be ready."

05:15.232 --> 05:17.150
So, the...

05:17.234 --> 05:19.945
the casting director didn't know
kind of what was going on.

05:20.028 --> 05:23.490
So I just lay down.
I don't know how long I lay down for.

05:23.574 --> 05:25.450
And then I was just laying down.

05:25.534 --> 05:28.453
Preparing, preparing, preparing,
squeezing her hand.

05:28.537 --> 05:30.873
"Okay, I'm ready to go."
And then I was ready to go.

05:30.956 --> 05:34.543
The fantastic beauty of youth
that you don't--

05:34.626 --> 05:38.422
No one's told you that it's somehow wrong
or you can't take up space.

05:38.505 --> 05:42.176
I think back to it, and I--
and I really like her.

05:42.968 --> 05:45.012
I really like her for taking up
that space.

05:45.095 --> 05:48.223
I remember just knowing that
that part was mine.

05:49.016 --> 05:52.060
And just, like, shaking, like,
"This is gonna change my life.

05:52.144 --> 05:55.189
I know this is mine. This is my part."

05:56.523 --> 05:58.567
I came in to say hello.

06:00.485 --> 06:01.737
Hello.

06:02.321 --> 06:03.488
Guess what?

06:05.866 --> 06:07.492
I'm writing a book.

06:08.118 --> 06:10.120
It might get published.

06:10.204 --> 06:13.040
A book? About what?

06:14.875 --> 06:16.376
About my life.

06:26.803 --> 06:29.306
Dear Sandra, I'm gonna make the claim

06:29.389 --> 06:32.351
that you have the best face in the world.

06:34.019 --> 06:36.021
Sorry, I'll read that again.
That's hilarious.

06:36.104 --> 06:38.774
"I'm gonna make the claim
that you have the best face in the world."

06:38.857 --> 06:41.693
I don't know anything
about bone structure or proportions

06:41.777 --> 06:44.363
or what defines a good eyebrow
in any year.

06:44.446 --> 06:46.657
What I do know
is that anything your face does...

06:46.740 --> 06:48.700
"...is a cosmic event.

06:48.784 --> 06:50.661
And I vividly remember
the first time I saw it."

06:51.578 --> 06:53.956
It was an opening night showing
of The Princess Diaries,

06:54.039 --> 06:57.876
and you zipped in and out of the opening
school scene as Vice Principal Gupta.

06:57.960 --> 07:01.463
I straightened up in my seat
and knew I needed to see more of you.

07:02.047 --> 07:04.758
"I left the theater and went on to develop

07:04.842 --> 07:08.345
a grad school-level syllabus
on all things Sandra Oh."

07:08.428 --> 07:12.683
By the time Grey's Anatomy came out,
I felt like I hit the jackpot.

07:13.475 --> 07:16.061
It was that regularity
of seeing you consistently

07:16.144 --> 07:17.396
that spoke even deeper to me

07:17.479 --> 07:21.608
that I couldn't help but identify
with her, perhaps a little too much.

07:23.151 --> 07:26.905
I spent four years as a premed,
but questioned all of it.

07:27.447 --> 07:31.118
Weighing my love for comedy and performing
against my knack for science

07:31.201 --> 07:34.454
was putting me at odds with what
the world expected of someone like me.

07:34.538 --> 07:37.332
Did I love her because I was seeing
an Asian person on TV?

07:37.416 --> 07:40.711
"Or did I love her because
I was seeing a dramatized version

07:40.794 --> 07:43.046
of who I could be if I pursued medicine?"

07:43.130 --> 07:46.341
Anytime I saw you on screen,
my wires kept getting crossed.

07:46.425 --> 07:49.595
After going through
a pretty standard quarter-life crisis,

07:49.678 --> 07:52.347
I took a leap
into the uncertain waters of showbiz...

07:52.431 --> 07:56.101
"...trying to bring a Cristina Yang-like
discipline to comedy."

07:56.643 --> 07:59.021
I went into Target the other day.

07:59.104 --> 08:02.524
I wore a solid red T-shirt,
and everyone was obsessed with me.

08:03.692 --> 08:05.527
It involved slogging
through bar basement shows,

08:05.611 --> 08:10.490
thankless improv sets at festivals,
and lots of money towards classes.

08:11.325 --> 08:15.454
I knew it was part of the gritty,
character-building work of a real actor

08:15.537 --> 08:17.456
and something you did too.

08:17.539 --> 08:20.000
What I didn't know
was that with every earnest attempt

08:20.083 --> 08:21.627
at trying to make things happen,

08:21.710 --> 08:25.047
my path was inching
closer and closer to yours.

08:30.719 --> 08:33.138
By some glitch in the simulation,

08:33.222 --> 08:35.307
I was hired at SNL as a writer

08:36.099 --> 08:39.352
and spent the better part of
my first season there learning the ropes,

08:39.436 --> 08:42.898
trying week after week to bring a sketch
to the finish line and on the air.

08:42.981 --> 08:47.361
But it's difficult by design,
and it can bring you down pretty low.

08:49.112 --> 08:53.867
And then, by some planetary alignment
or another simulation glitch,

08:53.951 --> 08:55.786
you came to host SNL.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.246
Thank you.

08:57.329 --> 08:58.580
Thank you very much.

08:58.664 --> 09:01.416
It is so great to be hosting
Saturday Night Live.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.877
I'm Sandra Oh.

09:03.961 --> 09:06.588
The energy of that week
was electric for me.

09:06.672 --> 09:08.882
Suddenly, I had multiple sketches
make it to air.

09:08.966 --> 09:10.300
Wow.

09:11.552 --> 09:14.680
Glorious Leader says, "Very impressive."

09:14.763 --> 09:18.517
Best of all, I shared a moment
on-screen with you in a live sketch.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.061
I'll never forget the moment itself.

09:21.144 --> 09:23.105
You've been an anchor for me
in an industry

09:23.188 --> 09:25.274
where things happen at such a frantic pace

09:25.357 --> 09:27.651
that it's hard to be still
and take in the present.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.778
I will never take for granted
that you've taught me

09:29.862 --> 09:32.531
so many lessons throughout my life.

09:35.576 --> 09:38.412
Being able to work with you
led to so much else for me,

09:38.495 --> 09:40.622
and I will always be in your debt.

09:41.915 --> 09:45.586
Sandra, I don't know if I'll ever
be able to properly repay it,

09:45.669 --> 09:49.131
but I honor that debt now
by realizing that I could be

09:49.214 --> 09:52.342
an open door for others,
just as you've been for me.

09:52.426 --> 09:55.262
Thank you for giving us
a face to look up to

09:55.345 --> 09:57.973
and letting the observers below dream big.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.809
Oh, my God. This is amazing!

10:01.560 --> 10:03.061
Sorry. That was a little loud.

10:07.024 --> 10:09.735
I actually left NTS early
because I had work.

10:10.569 --> 10:13.989
The year that I left,
I starred in three films,

10:14.072 --> 10:18.744
which, in, like, the early-mid-'90
was extraordinary

10:18.827 --> 10:22.122
for a young Asian actress.

10:22.915 --> 10:25.501
That was The Diary of Evelyn Lau,

10:26.585 --> 10:28.420
Double Happiness,

10:28.504 --> 10:31.590
and Borduas and Me,
which was a short film.

10:32.174 --> 10:35.344
And so I came to Hollywood.

10:35.928 --> 10:37.596
I was about 24.

10:37.679 --> 10:40.724
I came out of theater school.
I did these films.

10:40.807 --> 10:43.560
I'm gonna just take the world by storm,
of course,

10:43.644 --> 10:45.729
'cause that's what I wanna give the world.

10:46.438 --> 10:48.732
And then I came to Hollywood,

10:48.815 --> 10:51.944
and it was a--
it was a rough transition...

10:54.071 --> 10:56.865
because no one cared
about the work that I had done.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.080
I have never felt the same type

11:03.163 --> 11:07.376
of racial oppression

11:07.459 --> 11:09.002
or boxing.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.172
That fear...

11:13.298 --> 11:17.302
that you're always carrying around
in the back pocket as a person of color,

11:17.386 --> 11:20.848
that you don't belong
and that people don't want you here,

11:20.931 --> 11:24.059
came to the forefront in certain meetings.

11:26.228 --> 11:28.355
They're gonna tell you the truth.

11:28.438 --> 11:31.483
And the truth is, is that
there's really nothing for you here.

11:31.567 --> 11:33.443
So you can keep on going,

11:33.527 --> 11:35.821
but just to let you know,
it's gonna be hard.

11:35.904 --> 11:38.323
That was crushing for me.

11:41.368 --> 11:46.081
I do remember just weeping and weeping.

11:47.749 --> 11:50.878
But you gotta keep on getting up to bat.

11:52.004 --> 11:54.339
For a long time, it was me

11:54.423 --> 11:58.510
and a handful of Asian American actors
who were out there,

11:58.594 --> 12:00.012
and we never worked together.

12:00.095 --> 12:03.432
Ultimately, you get to the point
where I don't care what you have to say.

12:04.349 --> 12:05.767
I'm doing my work.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.145
And then I did everything.

12:09.396 --> 12:12.649
I was doing short film, theater,

12:13.525 --> 12:16.612
any type of radio voice, anything.
You just do anything.

12:16.695 --> 12:20.532
I am always going to be able
to find a creative way of using this

12:20.616 --> 12:22.451
for one's own growth.

12:23.619 --> 12:27.706
And I just met people
who were willing to be on my side.

12:27.789 --> 12:30.042
And that starts with Robert Wuhl.

12:30.125 --> 12:33.086
Robert Wuhl was the creator of Arliss.

12:33.170 --> 12:36.965
It was a half-hour comedy
about sports on HBO.

12:37.049 --> 12:39.635
And I auditioned for it.
And I remember-- I honestly--

12:39.718 --> 12:43.680
I called the character, Arliss,
the wrong name.

12:43.764 --> 12:47.726
I called him "Airless"
for the entire audition, I think.

12:47.809 --> 12:49.853
And at the very end, he was so kind.

12:49.937 --> 12:52.898
And he goes,
"By the way, the name is Arliss."

12:52.981 --> 12:54.650
I mean, like, come on.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.610
I need you to clear my schedule all day.

12:56.693 --> 12:59.112
Whoa, whoa! Hey, D'Artagnan,
you almost took my head off.

12:59.196 --> 13:00.197
Sorry. Sorry.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.450
It was a small cast. It was four of us.

13:03.534 --> 13:05.869
And that ran for seven seasons.

13:05.953 --> 13:07.329
And I cut my teeth.

13:07.913 --> 13:09.790
You're ripping off a little old lady?

13:09.873 --> 13:10.874
You know-- Well, they--

13:13.085 --> 13:14.795
I learned a lot,

13:14.878 --> 13:18.549
and I'm extremely grateful to him
for giving me that opportunity.

13:19.633 --> 13:24.805
And I'm really, really fortunate
to have worked with showrunners

13:24.888 --> 13:26.473
and people who have created shows

13:26.557 --> 13:30.602
who have valued what I could do
and wanted what I could do.

13:39.361 --> 13:40.779
Dear Sandra,

13:40.863 --> 13:44.449
I'm from a small town in Puerto Rico
called Utuado.

13:44.533 --> 13:48.912
Ever since I was a little kid,
I've always loved performing.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.957
I used to make up dance shows
in my living room.

13:52.040 --> 13:56.503
But Utuado didn't have anything
going on in terms of the arts,

13:56.587 --> 13:59.756
so my parents had to drive me
an hour each way

13:59.840 --> 14:02.885
just so I could take acting
and dance classes.

14:02.968 --> 14:06.263
Even at a young age,
I knew how special it was...

14:06.346 --> 14:07.973
"...to be able to perform."

14:08.056 --> 14:10.934
When I was 12,
I heard a casting call on the radio.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.770
An opportunity
to audition here in Puerto Rico

14:13.854 --> 14:17.399
for a shot
at a bigger audition in Hollywood.

14:17.482 --> 14:22.529
Out of the 600 kids that showed up,
they chose 50. I was one of them.

14:22.613 --> 14:26.158
I flew to Los Angeles,
and there was a competition

14:26.241 --> 14:28.452
where we each performed a monologue,

14:28.535 --> 14:30.746
and I took first place overall.

14:30.829 --> 14:32.456
It actually landed me a role

14:32.539 --> 14:36.710
on an episode of a TV show,
but it also made me think.

14:36.793 --> 14:40.005
How would I be able to continue acting
in huge performances

14:40.088 --> 14:42.883
or TV shows while living in Puerto Rico?

14:42.966 --> 14:45.552
"I would never have an experience
like this on the island.

14:45.636 --> 14:47.262
I doubted my future."

14:47.346 --> 14:49.556
My parents would never be able to afford

14:49.640 --> 14:53.018
constantly traveling back and forth
to Los Angeles,

14:53.101 --> 14:56.522
and the idea of making it in Hollywood
seemed impossible.

14:57.356 --> 14:59.691
I came home to Puerto Rico depressed.

14:59.775 --> 15:02.361
My best friend came over
to try and cheer me up.

15:02.444 --> 15:03.779
She just stares.

15:03.862 --> 15:05.656
She put on Grey's Anatomy.

15:05.739 --> 15:08.158
The way that they talk about her
around here,

15:08.242 --> 15:10.285
it's like she's a legend, you know?

15:10.369 --> 15:12.788
"And after a few episodes, I was hooked.

15:13.455 --> 15:15.415
I immediately looked you up."

15:15.499 --> 15:18.710
When I saw that you were Canadian,
I read your backstory.

15:18.794 --> 15:21.922
I just thought,
"Wow, here's this amazing actress

15:22.005 --> 15:25.592
who was able to find success
on a prime-time American TV show,

15:25.676 --> 15:28.136
even though she wasn't from the States.

15:28.220 --> 15:30.848
Maybe I could find a way to do it too."

15:31.723 --> 15:34.351
You always play complex,
unique characters.

15:34.434 --> 15:37.855
"Characters that challenge
our assumptions, our expectations."

15:37.938 --> 15:41.400
Being Gen Z,
part of the LGBTQ community

15:41.483 --> 15:43.986
and Latino,
I had felt kicked out of the running...

15:44.069 --> 15:46.822
...for so many
traditional roles in Hollywood.

15:46.905 --> 15:50.450
"But the variety of characters you play
gave me a reason to keep trying."

15:50.534 --> 15:51.535
Good for you.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.997
Sandra, even though
we're from different backgrounds,

15:55.080 --> 15:57.416
I really feel this connection to you
and your path.

15:57.499 --> 16:00.127
You were an outsider, just like me.

16:00.210 --> 16:02.838
You're a person of color, just like me.

16:02.921 --> 16:05.257
And yet you managed
to break into Hollywood.

16:05.340 --> 16:07.342
You made me see that I could do it too.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.513
I decided not to give up,
and as a matter of fact,

16:11.597 --> 16:14.516
just last year,
I landed a role on a TV show.

16:14.600 --> 16:15.809
Fantastic.

16:17.394 --> 16:19.730
It's getting better for people of color.

16:19.813 --> 16:25.068
Latinos are 18% of the US population,
but only 3% of leading roles on camera.

16:25.152 --> 16:28.447
You give me hope
that I can make my mark as you did...

16:28.530 --> 16:31.533
"...and I want to break through
to the mainstream...

16:31.617 --> 16:34.703
and inspire other young Puerto Ricans
to do the same."

16:35.287 --> 16:38.832
I want to show them that it's possible,
no matter where you live.

16:39.458 --> 16:42.336
Thank you. Thank you, Sebastian.

16:45.547 --> 16:49.092
Cristina Yang happened
'cause I was exercising choice.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.303
I first auditioned
for Chandra Wilson's part.

16:51.386 --> 16:55.098
I remember asking, "What other parts
are there available in this show?"

16:55.182 --> 16:59.853
And the part for Cristina, who was clearly
the antagonist, had not been cast.

16:59.937 --> 17:04.023
I'm like, "The antagonist. No,
I want to play her. I want to play her.

17:04.107 --> 17:06.944
She's the one who gets...
with the protagonist.

17:07.027 --> 17:10.196
I want to play her. She's ambitious.
What is that? I want to do that."

17:10.280 --> 17:13.032
Dr. Yang, listen.
If you could give me a few minutes.

17:13.116 --> 17:16.036
I really don't have the time or the need
to keep dragging this out.

17:19.414 --> 17:21.666
Grey's had so many great writers,

17:21.750 --> 17:28.549
and they really allowed me
to exercise agency through collaboration.

17:28.632 --> 17:31.802
It's very, very tough as an actor.

17:31.885 --> 17:34.346
Classically, we don't have agency.

17:35.138 --> 17:37.808
You have to earn
the position of collaborating,

17:37.891 --> 17:40.435
because the writers
and the directors have to know

17:40.519 --> 17:42.980
that you actually have something to say.

17:43.063 --> 17:46.024
And I feel like I absolutely
have earned it at this point.

17:46.108 --> 17:49.945
I am the unseen hand to his brilliance.

17:50.779 --> 17:55.075
You're just really trying
to protect the truth of the character.

17:55.158 --> 17:57.244
That's what you're always fighting for.

17:57.327 --> 17:59.913
Make it stop. Make it stop.

17:59.997 --> 18:04.877
But one of the great accomplishments
that I was able to do

18:04.960 --> 18:07.421
and be a part of, along with the writers,

18:07.504 --> 18:11.508
is actually developing a character
in real time.

18:11.592 --> 18:15.387
It's a very rare and special experience
as an actor

18:15.470 --> 18:18.682
to be able to be living
with a character for that long

18:18.765 --> 18:21.185
and really change them.

18:21.268 --> 18:26.273
So it was amazing to play over ten years.

18:31.653 --> 18:33.447
Are you here to kill me?

18:36.200 --> 18:37.784
We're just watching you.

18:37.868 --> 18:39.411
Who?

18:40.537 --> 18:44.583
When I actually
got the part of Eve in Killing Eve,

18:44.666 --> 18:48.462
I was scrolling through my phone
and talking to my agent at the same time.

18:49.296 --> 18:52.299
And then I just remember
scrolling through,

18:52.382 --> 18:55.636
as one does quickly through a script
and asking my agent,

18:55.719 --> 18:58.222
"I don't understand.
Who am I supposed to be playing?"

18:58.305 --> 19:01.308
'Cause I was like, I don't think
anyone's gonna hire me to play...

19:02.351 --> 19:04.144
a Russian assassin.

19:04.228 --> 19:08.065
Anyway-- And I couldn't figure out

19:08.148 --> 19:11.068
who I was supposed to be.

19:11.151 --> 19:13.820
And then my agent said, "Eve."

19:13.904 --> 19:16.406
"Sandra, you're playing Eve."

19:17.199 --> 19:21.119
And I just-- It was such a rude awakening

19:21.203 --> 19:24.456
of my own internalized racism.

19:25.374 --> 19:29.127
I didn't think about myself
as a leading person

19:29.211 --> 19:31.797
because I couldn't even see myself
in the character.

19:33.090 --> 19:35.676
And then to suddenly catch myself...

19:36.802 --> 19:38.220
so...

19:39.805 --> 19:40.806
in the grips of it.

19:40.889 --> 19:41.932
Don't make me.

19:42.015 --> 19:44.184
When that happened,
I was so confused with my own mind.

19:44.268 --> 19:46.728
We have to stop
running into each other like that.

19:46.812 --> 19:50.065
Have I been beaten down so hard
for the past 20 years

19:50.148 --> 19:52.109
that I look at a script and I don't even--

19:52.192 --> 19:54.820
I don't even bother
seeing myself in it anymore?

19:55.404 --> 19:57.614
Why? How deep is it?

20:01.702 --> 20:03.871
How deep does racism go?

20:05.622 --> 20:08.500
Our internalized and societal?

20:09.918 --> 20:12.296
Profoundly deep.

20:13.630 --> 20:15.299
And so with that,

20:16.508 --> 20:19.428
the change needs to be
equally as profound.

20:20.554 --> 20:24.641
And I think it comes, no matter what,
first from here.

20:24.725 --> 20:26.268
Individually.

20:28.395 --> 20:31.398
And the Golden Globe goes to...

20:31.481 --> 20:33.150
Sandra Oh!

20:38.155 --> 20:43.243
It was great to be able to feel recognized

20:43.994 --> 20:45.704
by the community at large.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.961
Daddy! Oh, my God!

20:53.712 --> 20:58.008
When I won the Golden Globe
for Killing Eve, my parents were there.

20:58.091 --> 21:02.721
Overcoming my parents' disapproval
at the very beginning of my career,

21:03.430 --> 21:05.766
they mean so much to me.

21:05.849 --> 21:09.394
Now I feel very accepted by them.

21:09.478 --> 21:12.898
I'm so grateful to my family.

21:12.981 --> 21:15.192
There are two people here tonight

21:15.275 --> 21:17.819
that I am so grateful
that they're here with me.

21:17.903 --> 21:21.782
I'd like to thank my mother and my father.

21:27.829 --> 21:29.581
To be able to thank them,

21:29.665 --> 21:32.334
honor them,
and tell them that I love them,

21:32.417 --> 21:36.922
particularly in Korean,
was very meaningful to me.

21:37.005 --> 21:40.300
And again, you can never tell
when this is going to happen,

21:40.384 --> 21:43.887
but I think then it became meaningful
for other people.

21:43.971 --> 21:46.515
Mostly it was because

21:46.598 --> 21:48.225
it was, like, good for us.

21:48.308 --> 21:52.396
You know what I mean?
It was good for my community.

21:53.564 --> 21:57.234
That representation
to be able to insert itself

21:57.317 --> 21:59.945
into the fabric of the whole.

22:00.028 --> 22:04.867
And I have worked very hard
to be a part of the fabric.

22:14.251 --> 22:17.254
Dear Sandra, my father and grandfather
were both doctors.

22:17.337 --> 22:18.672
But even from a young age,

22:18.755 --> 22:21.550
I knew that wasn't the direction
I wanted to go in my life.

22:22.426 --> 22:24.386
My father didn't want me
to become a writer.

22:24.469 --> 22:26.430
He thought it was too risky
and too demanding...

22:26.513 --> 22:29.099
"...with no clear pathway for success."

22:29.183 --> 22:31.435
And it was dominated by white people.

22:31.518 --> 22:34.188
He believed I'd always be
an uninvited guest at the party

22:34.271 --> 22:36.773
because that's what
he'd experienced himself.

22:36.857 --> 22:39.693
He wasn't wrong. Once, on an assignment,

22:39.776 --> 22:41.612
I heard a well-known white filmmaker

22:41.695 --> 22:44.740
asking his manager why they sent
a Chinaman to write about him.

22:45.782 --> 22:48.577
I worried about being considered
an Asian American journalist,

22:48.660 --> 22:51.872
as opposed to a journalist
who just happened to be Asian American.

22:51.955 --> 22:53.290
And I wasn't alone.

22:53.373 --> 22:56.877
I have spoken to other Asian Americans
who all felt the same pressure

22:56.960 --> 23:01.256
to de-emphasize who we are in order
to be accepted into the mainstream.

23:02.090 --> 23:05.594
And then I saw you, Sandra,
on the 2018 Emmys,

23:05.677 --> 23:07.387
a moment that was so emblematic.

23:07.971 --> 23:11.016
Sandra Oh is the first Asian woman

23:11.099 --> 23:13.810
to be nominated
for a lead actress Emmy ever.

23:20.025 --> 23:23.362
Thank you,
but it's an honor just to be Asian.

23:24.279 --> 23:26.240
Your words touched every one of us

23:26.323 --> 23:28.492
who ever felt moved
to apologize for who we are.

23:29.409 --> 23:34.331
"All of us who covered up our sch--
our school lunches as kids,

23:34.414 --> 23:37.751
who made excuses
for the customs of our parents."

23:37.835 --> 23:41.296
That one sentence became a rallying cry
for Asian Americans.

23:41.922 --> 23:45.092
It turned into a viral hashtag,
became a cultural phenomenon,

23:45.175 --> 23:47.928
and then it sparked an idea.

23:48.762 --> 23:50.931
I'm on the board of directors
of East West Players,

23:51.014 --> 23:54.309
the oldest Asian American
theater company in the United States.

23:54.393 --> 23:57.938
You've always been an inspiration to us,
but no one has better summarized

23:58.021 --> 24:00.858
what we do and why we do it
than this one precious line

24:00.941 --> 24:03.151
you spoke in a single unexpected moment.

24:03.861 --> 24:06.613
During one of our meetings,
I just blurted it out,

24:06.697 --> 24:08.365
"We should wear this on our chest."

24:08.448 --> 24:10.075
"This is who we are."

24:10.742 --> 24:14.413
Simply printed with your quote
in white to raise money for the theater.

24:15.038 --> 24:18.458
We've sold thousands of shirts now,
raising tens of thousands of dollars

24:18.542 --> 24:19.710
for East West Players.

24:21.753 --> 24:25.549
Your quote gave Asian Americans
a way to wear their pride in public.

24:26.300 --> 24:29.219
Even during this pandemic,
in the face of vicious attacks

24:29.303 --> 24:31.263
from those incited by talks

24:31.346 --> 24:33.932
of the "China virus" and "the Kong Flu,"

24:34.016 --> 24:37.019
Asian Americans wear the shirt
as a defiant gesture,

24:37.102 --> 24:39.354
refusing to let prejudice win.

24:40.772 --> 24:43.775
I couldn't be more thankful
for your support, your advocacy...

24:43.859 --> 24:45.944
"...your brilliance
and your continued shattering

24:46.028 --> 24:48.780
of stereotypes, both on-screen and off."

24:49.740 --> 24:52.743
It's made it safer for me to be who I am

24:52.826 --> 24:55.329
and for all of us
to be proud of who we are.

24:55.412 --> 24:59.208
"That we are woven deeply
into the fabric of this nation."

24:59.291 --> 25:03.420
And that, far from being ashamed
of who we are and where we've come from,

25:03.504 --> 25:05.839
it's an honor just to be us.

25:09.426 --> 25:10.427
Thank you.

25:13.222 --> 25:14.848
I think I need a tissue.

25:20.312 --> 25:23.815
In the field of entertainment
and culture,

25:24.942 --> 25:28.946
the one thing that I can say very truly
and from deep experience

25:29.029 --> 25:31.365
is that change is slow.

25:35.077 --> 25:38.163
We have been through a pandemic.

25:38.247 --> 25:40.332
Stop Asian hate!

25:41.500 --> 25:43.585
We have been through

25:43.669 --> 25:47.256
a social and racial awakening
and reckoning.

25:52.845 --> 25:55.138
Many of us are waking up to...

25:56.306 --> 26:00.394
a much broader, clearer,
shared sense of what reality is.

26:03.063 --> 26:06.692
The mass shooting
of six Asian women at their place of work

26:06.775 --> 26:10.696
and two other white victims,
is reverberating around the country.

26:10.779 --> 26:13.156
The shootings in Georgia happened.

26:14.825 --> 26:17.119
I woke up that morning on a Saturday,

26:17.202 --> 26:19.246
you know, having worked a full week.

26:19.329 --> 26:20.998
Many of us on set

26:21.790 --> 26:23.208
were very rocked by it

26:23.292 --> 26:26.837
and talking to fellow crew members
about it.

26:26.920 --> 26:29.423
And then that morning,
I woke up and I was like,

26:29.506 --> 26:32.176
"There's got to be a rally
somewhere in Pittsburgh."

26:33.343 --> 26:35.012
Justice!

26:35.095 --> 26:36.680
Hello!

26:36.763 --> 26:38.599
Hi. My name is Sandra Oh.

26:41.143 --> 26:43.729
We must understand, as Asian Americans,

26:43.812 --> 26:46.940
we just need to reach out our hand
to our sisters and brothers

26:47.024 --> 26:48.942
and say, "Help me," and, "I'm here."

26:49.026 --> 26:52.446
And just for one thing,
I am proud to be Asian!

26:54.364 --> 26:58.160
I was so moved, also concerned

26:58.243 --> 27:02.456
with the level of fear
that is happening within our community,

27:02.539 --> 27:05.250
and to not let that take a hold of us.

27:07.544 --> 27:10.756
When Asian lives are under attack,
you got my back?

27:10.839 --> 27:11.965
We've got your back!

27:12.049 --> 27:15.844
It was spectacular to see.

27:17.262 --> 27:19.306
These young people just saying,

27:19.389 --> 27:22.309
"This is my experience, and here I am."

27:22.392 --> 27:24.144
We will not keep our heads down.

27:24.228 --> 27:26.021
But instead, we will make noise,

27:26.104 --> 27:28.732
and we'll take up our rightful space
in this country.

27:35.072 --> 27:38.575
There is room,
and there's necessity to be strong...

27:40.285 --> 27:43.622
and to have pride, and to state that.

27:47.084 --> 27:49.002
Let us not be ruled by fear.

27:50.170 --> 27:53.715
The only way to also move through that
is through a connection.

27:54.424 --> 27:57.719
Thank you, Sandra,
for inspiring me to keep after my dreams

27:57.803 --> 28:00.138
and to never, ever give up.

28:00.222 --> 28:03.684
With everything you do,
you continue to raise awareness

28:03.767 --> 28:05.644
to the fact that we belong here.

28:07.145 --> 28:08.272
Love, Jeff.

28:08.355 --> 28:10.858
Yours truly, Sebastian.

28:10.941 --> 28:13.610
Sincerely, Bowen.

28:17.614 --> 28:19.741
Think about now. What would you do?

28:21.076 --> 28:24.371
Being isolated from people,
would you go up and help someone?

28:24.454 --> 28:26.039
Someone who doesn't look like you?

28:26.123 --> 28:30.210
There's space for it now,
but it has got to come from within.

28:31.128 --> 28:33.547
That's actually
the place of transformation.
