00:09.933 --> 00:13.133
**

00:13.133 --> 00:14.533
All: Hey!

00:14.533 --> 00:16.933
We're on vacation
at Universal Orlando Resort.

00:16.933 --> 00:18.667
No, we're not.
We are working.

00:18.667 --> 00:20.533
Yeah, we're here filming
an entire episode.

00:20.533 --> 00:22.400
I'm going on rides.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.967
You --
I'm going on rides.

00:24.967 --> 00:27.467
Narrator: Coming up on
a special hour-long episode

00:27.467 --> 00:29.567
of "Impractical Jokers."

00:31.733 --> 00:34.467
What's got Murr taking cover?

00:36.400 --> 00:38.900
Why is Joe going on
the ride of his life?

00:38.900 --> 00:40.967
Joe: By this time tomorrow,
I'll be dead.

00:42.200 --> 00:44.300
Narrator:
And which losing joker

00:44.300 --> 00:46.433
will be sent to the funny farm
in tonight's punishment?

00:46.433 --> 00:48.333
* Welcome to the barnyard

00:49.800 --> 00:52.633
Sal:
Prepare for something amazing.

00:52.633 --> 00:53.700
Q: Hey, mustache, what's up?

00:55.400 --> 00:57.033
Murr:
I want my mommy!

00:58.833 --> 01:01.633
Sal:
I will never forgive you!

01:01.633 --> 01:03.667
Joe: Larry!

01:09.900 --> 01:11.433
Today,
we're working the line

01:11.433 --> 01:12.833
at Transformers: The Ride-3D.

01:12.833 --> 01:14.333
While managing
the flow of people,

01:14.333 --> 01:15.333
we'll have to do and say

01:15.333 --> 01:16.733
whatever the other guys
tell us.

01:16.733 --> 01:18.200
If you refuse
to do or say anything,

01:18.200 --> 01:20.833
you're gonna transform
into a loser.

01:20.833 --> 01:22.867
Guys?
I can't see us!

01:22.867 --> 01:24.633
Oh, there you are.
-It's camouflage.

01:24.633 --> 01:26.433
-I forgot to put clothes on.
-There you are.

01:26.433 --> 01:27.733
It's theme park-ouflage.

01:32.067 --> 01:33.733
Q: Murr, you know
what you look like?

01:33.733 --> 01:35.733
In any movie
when the military gets involved,

01:35.733 --> 01:38.767
there's a real jerk officer
in charge of the whole thing.

01:38.767 --> 01:40.067
That's you.

01:40.067 --> 01:41.500
I thought you were gonna say
"the one woman."

01:44.067 --> 01:46.067
Murr, you love amusement parks,
right, bud?

01:46.067 --> 01:47.433
I love theme parks.

01:50.767 --> 01:52.067
Sal: Just look forward.

01:52.067 --> 01:54.667
Just go,
"I love theme parks."

01:54.667 --> 01:56.633
I love theme parks.

01:59.067 --> 02:01.067
I love theme parks.

02:01.067 --> 02:03.533
I go to theme parks
whenever I can, honestly.

02:03.533 --> 02:05.067
There's so many parks
in the world.

02:05.067 --> 02:07.067
There's so many parks
in the world.

02:07.067 --> 02:09.100
Sal: But not all of them
have themes.

02:09.100 --> 02:10.667
But not all of them
are themed.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.133
Just talk factually.

02:14.133 --> 02:17.267
Theme parks are
for lovers, friends,

02:17.267 --> 02:20.733
families, children,
children's children.

02:20.733 --> 02:22.067
Murray, Murr, "T".

02:22.067 --> 02:27.700
T-H-E-M-E parks.

02:30.600 --> 02:31.933
Oh, you can go.
Oh, you guys can go.

02:31.933 --> 02:33.300
I didn't know
you were still here.

02:33.300 --> 02:35.500
Murr: I'm sorry, go.
Go, go.

02:38.100 --> 02:39.500
Okay, hold on.
One second, okay?

02:39.500 --> 02:40.533
So Murray loves churros.

02:40.533 --> 02:41.600
We all know this.

02:41.600 --> 02:42.733
So we're gonna
send them out.

02:42.733 --> 02:44.567
Okay, Murray,
you have a delivery.

02:44.567 --> 02:47.400
Man:
Carry the churros?

02:47.400 --> 02:48.900
Sure.

02:48.900 --> 02:50.400
Now, Murr, lick all
the cinnamon and sugar

02:50.400 --> 02:51.133
off those churros.

02:53.067 --> 02:54.800
I want them to be
just pieces of dough

02:54.800 --> 02:56.200
when they're done.

02:58.233 --> 03:00.067
Joe:

03:00.067 --> 03:03.067
**

03:07.167 --> 03:10.300
Just throw it on the floor
and go to the next one.

03:17.567 --> 03:20.567
Q:
Done with that one, Murr?

03:24.067 --> 03:25.800
It's such
a pure discarding of it.

03:25.800 --> 03:30.933
**

03:30.933 --> 03:31.867
A seagull!

03:35.200 --> 03:36.633
Q: Discard,
then let them in.

03:39.367 --> 03:42.300
Come on through.
See you guys.

03:42.300 --> 03:43.533
I'm gonna throw up.

03:45.700 --> 03:47.400
So just come on through.
There you go.

03:47.400 --> 03:48.400
There you go, guys.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.167
I have never seen anybody

03:50.167 --> 03:52.333
look more out of place
in a military outfit

03:52.333 --> 03:53.500
than Joe Gatto.

03:53.500 --> 03:54.833
Sal: You're a walking
draft dodger.

03:56.700 --> 03:58.067
Hi, guys,
how are you?

03:58.067 --> 03:59.100
Oh, yeah,
you can go under.

03:59.100 --> 04:00.333
Go under, yeah.
Break all the rules.

04:00.333 --> 04:01.567
Murr: You want to make them
go around again?

04:01.567 --> 04:02.833
I saw you.

04:02.833 --> 04:05.167
I saw you go under,
so now you go around again.

04:05.167 --> 04:06.300
Go ahead.
Now go around.

04:06.300 --> 04:07.367
Like, the right way.

04:07.367 --> 04:08.567
This way, now this way.

04:08.567 --> 04:10.533
Like, the right way.
Go the right way.

04:10.533 --> 04:12.467
Are they with you,
as well?

04:12.467 --> 04:14.767
Because he cut the line,
everybody does a full lap.

04:14.767 --> 04:16.800
'Cause of you two,
everybody full lap around.

04:16.800 --> 04:18.133
Everybody do it.
Let's go.

04:18.133 --> 04:19.633
Everybody.
I'll close the whole thing.

04:19.633 --> 04:21.067
That's what I can do.
Watch this.

04:21.067 --> 04:22.533
Now nobody goes on.
Now nobody has fun.

04:22.533 --> 04:25.133
Do not blame me,
blame him.

04:25.133 --> 04:26.233
Do not blame him,

04:26.233 --> 04:27.800
blame this guy here
who did the duck under

04:27.800 --> 04:28.933
and the friend.

04:28.933 --> 04:30.700
Q:
Why is he still smiling?

04:30.700 --> 04:32.167
Not sure why
you're still smiling.

04:32.167 --> 04:33.133
This is all your fault.

04:33.133 --> 04:35.233
Everybody's in there
having fun.

04:35.233 --> 04:36.533
You should transform
that attitude

04:36.533 --> 04:37.600
into somebody
who listens.

04:40.133 --> 04:42.267
You together? You --

04:42.267 --> 04:43.733
-Sir, I'm sorry.
-That's okay.

04:43.733 --> 04:47.067
Joe, be thoroughly confused
by the whole process.

04:49.467 --> 04:51.833
So if I move this,
you guys just go?

04:51.833 --> 04:53.133
Uh...

04:53.133 --> 04:55.467
So when I move this,
you just go.

04:57.067 --> 05:00.333
Joe, open-mouth sneeze
in the garbage can.

05:02.300 --> 05:03.967
Q:
There's the wind-up.

05:11.300 --> 05:12.933
Okay, so let's come on through.
There you go.

05:12.933 --> 05:14.333
Sorry,
hold on right there.

05:14.333 --> 05:16.833
Murr: Joe, let it settle,
and then be like, uh,

05:16.833 --> 05:18.867
"

05:18.867 --> 05:19.767
Little help?"

05:19.767 --> 05:20.967
I mean,
if they want to get in

05:20.967 --> 05:22.433
anytime in the next hour.

05:28.933 --> 05:30.500
Long line.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.900
You want to get in?

05:41.133 --> 05:42.900
Just say, "I hope you're
enjoying your day.

05:42.900 --> 05:44.667
It's gonna be
a 45-minute wait."

05:44.667 --> 05:46.167
Hey, guys,
hope you're enjoying your day.

05:46.167 --> 05:47.700
It's about a 45-minute wait
at this point.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.600
Now sneak back
and put your hand out.

05:56.133 --> 05:57.933
$5 will get you on
in five.

05:57.933 --> 06:00.133
$5 will get you on in five.

06:01.933 --> 06:04.200
Stop acting like
you don't hear me.

06:04.200 --> 06:07.467
I'm asking for a tip.

06:07.467 --> 06:09.233
Murr: Oh! Oh!

06:12.900 --> 06:13.967
You're in, you're in.

06:13.967 --> 06:15.567
Have a good time, boys,
have a good time.

06:18.967 --> 06:21.433
Q: Oh, my God.

06:21.433 --> 06:22.633
About an hour wait
at this point,

06:22.633 --> 06:23.633
About an hour wait.

06:26.067 --> 06:28.967
Joe: Wow, look at Q,

06:28.967 --> 06:31.433
he actually looks like he got
a military-grade haircut.

06:31.433 --> 06:32.600
What you don't know is

06:32.600 --> 06:34.700
there's bobby pins
holding it in the back.

06:34.700 --> 06:36.233
Q: Right in, right in,
right in.

06:36.233 --> 06:37.500
Okay,
mind if I hold you one sec

06:37.500 --> 06:38.800
and then
we're gonna get you in.

06:38.800 --> 06:41.800
Sergeant Quinn here,
reporting for booty.

06:42.933 --> 06:44.500
I'm Sergeant Quinn.

06:44.500 --> 06:46.300
Nice to meet you.

06:46.300 --> 06:47.600
Reporting for booty!

06:47.600 --> 06:50.600
Yes, reporting for booty.

06:50.600 --> 06:51.800
You know?

06:52.767 --> 06:53.767
-He gets it.
-Yeah!

06:53.767 --> 06:55.400
Good to go, guys.
Thank you.

06:55.400 --> 06:56.633
Joe: Q, when I tell you,

06:56.633 --> 06:57.567
you're gonna throw your arm out
and say stop.

06:58.767 --> 06:59.833
Ready?

06:59.833 --> 07:01.067
And now.

07:01.067 --> 07:02.067
Stop.

07:05.267 --> 07:06.100
Okay, go.

07:06.100 --> 07:07.833
Okay, go, go, go.

07:07.833 --> 07:09.133
Got it, got it.

07:09.133 --> 07:10.267
And...

07:10.267 --> 07:12.233
Stop.
-Stop.

07:14.700 --> 07:17.900
All right, good.
All right, you're good.

07:17.900 --> 07:20.300
Get in there, guys.
Yeah, perfect.

07:20.300 --> 07:21.833
Yeah, yeah,
enjoy the fun.

07:21.833 --> 07:22.900
Stop!

07:22.900 --> 07:24.300
Stop!

07:27.667 --> 07:29.633
-Thank you.

07:29.633 --> 07:31.333
Just chill out here,
one second.

07:31.333 --> 07:32.867
Joe:
So like I was saying,

07:32.867 --> 07:35.400
I was picking seagull feathers
out of my fender.

07:37.067 --> 07:38.200
So like I was saying,

07:38.200 --> 07:39.967
I was picking
seagull feathers

07:39.967 --> 07:42.167
out of my fender all morning,
you know?

07:42.167 --> 07:43.700
I got a call
from the lawyer.

07:43.700 --> 07:46.067
I got a call from the lawyer
and he's like,

07:46.067 --> 07:47.367
"Yo, what's up with
these seagull feathers

07:47.367 --> 07:48.867
that your neighbors
keep complaining about?"

07:48.867 --> 07:50.167
Recognize him.
He's the wrong guy.

07:50.167 --> 07:51.367
And I probably
shouldn't be

07:51.367 --> 07:52.700
tearing down beaches
like that,

07:52.700 --> 07:54.433
nor should I be putting
bread on my bumper,

07:54.433 --> 07:56.400
but I --

07:56.400 --> 07:58.167
Oh, sh-- You're not the guy
I thought you were.

07:58.167 --> 07:59.600
Oh, my God!

08:01.567 --> 08:02.500
Okay, one, two.

08:02.500 --> 08:03.500
Yeah, you two in,

08:03.500 --> 08:05.067
and I'm gonna
cut you guys off.

08:05.067 --> 08:06.900
Uh, sorry, Miss.
You can't ride this
if you're pregnant.

08:10.933 --> 08:12.500
Murr:
Are you kidding?!
That's a thumbs down.

08:12.500 --> 08:16.300
Joe: Don't you dare.
That's a thumbs down
for old B.Q.

08:16.300 --> 08:17.633
Wow.

08:17.633 --> 08:19.867
Thank you very much.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.767
Enjoy the ride.

08:21.767 --> 08:23.367
Joe: Okay, here we go, boys.
Sal's up.

08:23.367 --> 08:26.167
One sec, guys, one sec.

08:26.167 --> 08:27.667
Ask this child if he's sure
that this is his mommy.

08:30.267 --> 08:33.667
Oh, oh, oops.

08:33.667 --> 08:34.733
Are you sure...

08:34.733 --> 08:37.067
Are you sure these adults
are with you?

08:37.067 --> 08:38.067
You know the adults?

08:38.067 --> 08:40.233
You sure?

08:42.233 --> 08:43.900
Murr: It seems like
he might have been intimidated

08:43.900 --> 08:45.067
by the parents
right behind him.

08:45.067 --> 08:46.167
Why don't you check
with the other kid?

08:46.167 --> 08:47.533
Joe: Yeah, check in
with the other kid.

08:50.800 --> 08:53.067
Do you know these adults?

08:53.067 --> 08:54.967
Do you know them?

08:54.967 --> 08:57.233
They're not holding you
against your will?

08:57.233 --> 08:58.967
You feel safe?

09:03.633 --> 09:05.533
Joe: Make it fall
in front of the parents.

09:05.533 --> 09:07.300
Go up to them and go,
"You know these kids?

09:07.300 --> 09:09.133
They're not holding you
against your will?"

09:15.167 --> 09:16.333
Thank you.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.967
Have a great time,
guys.

09:20.967 --> 09:22.133
You know these kids,
right?
Yeah, I'm okay.

09:22.133 --> 09:23.367
They're not holding you
against your will?

09:23.367 --> 09:25.600
No, but if you want them,
you can take them.

09:26.700 --> 09:27.800
One sec, guys.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.467
Murr:
Bud, are you feeling tired?

09:29.467 --> 09:31.533
You want to fall asleep?

09:37.400 --> 09:39.900
-Asleep at his post.

09:42.500 --> 09:46.967
Murr: Sal's got
the mouth open now.

09:51.433 --> 09:52.600
Joe: Wake up.

09:58.733 --> 10:00.433
I swear to God,
if he slaps me one more time.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.800
Joe:
I always slap you.

10:01.800 --> 10:04.000
I mean, take a look at all
the times I've slapped him.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.067
Oh!

10:07.633 --> 10:09.233
Oh, sh.

10:10.333 --> 10:11.733
Oh, sh--

10:15.000 --> 10:17.267
-Still falling for that.
-Season six.

10:17.267 --> 10:19.067
'Cause it's so stupid.

10:19.067 --> 10:20.567
Stop. One second.
One second.

10:20.567 --> 10:22.300
You'll be in
in 204 seconds.

10:22.300 --> 10:24.767
It'll be about
204 seconds.

10:25.967 --> 10:28.000
Great, now count
the 204 seconds.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.467
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 --

10:32.467 --> 10:34.900
Murr:
Look at her, look at her!

10:34.900 --> 10:35.900
50.

10:35.900 --> 10:36.900
Q: What did you say?
I'm sorry.

10:36.900 --> 10:38.333
What was that?
What was that?

10:38.333 --> 10:40.467
-Nothing.
-Oh, sorry.

10:40.467 --> 10:41.567
Uh...

10:41.567 --> 10:44.300
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9,

10:44.300 --> 10:45.900
10, 11, 12, 13,
14, 15, 16 --

10:45.900 --> 10:47.467
Joe: Why don't we use Jay
to help us out a little bit.

10:47.467 --> 10:49.433
One of our producers, Jay,
is working down there.

10:49.433 --> 10:50.533
Jay, go up to Sal and say,

10:50.533 --> 10:51.900
"Is it your turn
to go on break?"

10:51.900 --> 10:53.333
Interrupt him.
107, 108 --

10:53.333 --> 10:55.067
Just make sure
you make your break.

10:55.067 --> 10:56.567
I'm due for break
in like 20.

10:56.567 --> 10:58.567
Joe: 20. 21, 22, 23.

10:58.567 --> 11:00.233
20.

11:00.233 --> 11:02.667
21, 22, 23.

11:05.533 --> 11:06.533
Just -- I can't even.

11:06.533 --> 11:08.067
You know what?
Just go in, you guys.

11:08.067 --> 11:10.167
If anybody asks,
you waited 204 seconds.
Okay.

11:12.367 --> 11:14.567
Narrator: Q got caught
in the line of fire,

11:14.567 --> 11:16.900
so he's first up
on the loser board.

11:16.900 --> 11:20.767
**

11:20.767 --> 11:21.867
Here we go!

11:21.867 --> 11:23.800
Today, we are
at Islands of Adventure

11:23.800 --> 11:26.667
riding the amazing
Jurassic Park River Adventure.

11:26.667 --> 11:27.733
While we're on the ride,

11:27.733 --> 11:29.233
the other guys
will be telling us

11:29.233 --> 11:31.267
bizarre things to say
to the other boat riders.

11:31.267 --> 11:33.933
And if you refuse
to say anything, you lose.

11:33.933 --> 11:36.067
Ta-da!

11:50.500 --> 11:52.533
Q: Ah, Jurassic Park,
one of my favorite rides.

11:52.533 --> 11:54.333
It's just a pleasure cruise
while dinosaurs come at you.

11:54.333 --> 11:55.767
I love it.

11:55.767 --> 11:57.600
Yeah, so you just got to say
everything we tell you, Murr.

11:57.600 --> 11:58.733
Super easy.

11:58.733 --> 12:01.767
All right, buddy.
Here we go.

12:01.767 --> 12:03.200
This ride
was made for Murray.

12:03.200 --> 12:04.567
It's Murrassic Park.

12:07.067 --> 12:08.467
And here we go.

12:08.467 --> 12:10.333
So, Murr, the next line
I'm gonna give you,

12:10.333 --> 12:11.400
I want you to say it to

12:11.400 --> 12:13.067
the gentleman
in the white t-shirt

12:13.067 --> 12:14.300
on the other side
of the woman.

12:14.300 --> 12:15.700
Are you ready?
Here we go.

12:15.700 --> 12:18.467
I'm only on this ride
to be close to you.

12:19.967 --> 12:21.067
I, uh...

12:21.067 --> 12:22.533
I'm only on this ride

12:22.533 --> 12:24.167
t-to be close to you.

12:32.433 --> 12:34.800
Look at this dope.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.300
All right,
back to the guy.

12:36.300 --> 12:38.367
Your wife is way hotter
than my wife.

12:42.700 --> 12:44.100
Murr: Your, uh --

12:44.100 --> 12:46.067
Y-your wife is --
or your girlfriend...

12:46.067 --> 12:48.333
Yeah.
...is way hotter
than my girlfriend.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.300
Q: Just let him sit,
just let him sit.

12:53.300 --> 12:58.233
Whoa, smells like baby boy
needs a diaper wipe.

12:58.233 --> 13:02.667
Smells like baby boy back there
needs a diaper wipe.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.300
Wow, I'd let that dinosaur
spit in my mouth.

13:12.133 --> 13:13.400
Wow!

13:13.400 --> 13:16.100
I would let that dinosaur
spit right in my mouth.

13:21.233 --> 13:24.300
Murray,
all the hair on my body is fake.

13:24.300 --> 13:28.600
All the hair on my body
is fake.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.533
All of it.

13:30.533 --> 13:31.533
Man: Right.

13:40.867 --> 13:42.400
Q: Hey!

13:42.400 --> 13:44.333
And I thought
I was wet before.

13:44.333 --> 13:45.433
Murr: Oh, my God!

13:45.433 --> 13:47.667
And I thought
I was wet before!

13:54.367 --> 13:56.167
He looks like
he's animatronic.
I know.

13:56.167 --> 13:57.667
You know,
this is my tourist look.

13:57.667 --> 13:59.467
I'm looking like
a sweet tourist right now.

13:59.467 --> 14:01.233
You look like a guy
that camps out on line

14:01.233 --> 14:02.600
and comes here
every single day.

14:02.600 --> 14:03.667
Man: All right, everybody.

14:03.667 --> 14:05.233
The bar's gonna go
all the way down.

14:05.233 --> 14:07.067
Joe:
All right, the bar is down.

14:07.067 --> 14:09.667
The game begins.
Here we go, buddy.

14:09.667 --> 14:14.367
One more ride,
and it's night-night forever.

14:14.367 --> 14:15.767
One more ride,

14:15.767 --> 14:18.733
and it's night-night forever
for me, you know?

14:21.167 --> 14:22.367
Murr: One down.

14:22.367 --> 14:23.433
Here we go.

14:23.433 --> 14:24.500
Now you want to clap
coming through the door.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.167
You want to clap
coming through the door.

14:27.233 --> 14:28.733
Look at him!

14:31.067 --> 14:32.900
Oh, my God.

14:32.900 --> 14:34.200
Q, say, "Sure.

14:34.200 --> 14:37.600
Dinosaur bites someone,
everyone cheers.

14:37.600 --> 14:40.333
I do it and get slapped
with restraining orders."

14:40.333 --> 14:42.067
Q: Look at that.

14:42.067 --> 14:43.767
A dinosaur bites someone,
everybody cheers.

14:43.767 --> 14:45.533
I bite one,
and the cops get involved.

14:47.400 --> 14:49.167
Murr: All right, Q,
to the girl to your right,

14:49.167 --> 14:50.700
I want you to say,

14:50.700 --> 14:56.633
"You shouldn't show
so much skin in public."

14:56.633 --> 14:58.067
Q: I can't say that.

14:58.067 --> 14:59.333
Joe:
Oh, and that does it!

14:59.333 --> 15:00.933
No! No! Q!

15:00.933 --> 15:02.867
And you sunk the boat!

15:06.067 --> 15:08.533
Guys, so I just have to say
odd stuff in a close space?

15:08.533 --> 15:11.200
You excel at
this kind of challenge.

15:11.200 --> 15:12.433
Okay, do I have to even
do this ride,

15:12.433 --> 15:13.700
or do you want to give me
the thumbs up now?

15:13.700 --> 15:14.933
Q: You know what's funny,
dude?

15:14.933 --> 15:16.433
I don't see you
like this often,

15:16.433 --> 15:18.233
but to me right now,
you look like a dad.

15:19.567 --> 15:20.967
Rocking that dad body.

15:20.967 --> 15:22.467
I had that for years
before Milana.

15:25.367 --> 15:27.800
Joe, "By this time tomorrow,
I'll be dead."

15:31.733 --> 15:33.800
By this time tomorrow,
I'll be dead.

15:35.867 --> 15:37.767
Just let it sit there.

15:39.067 --> 15:40.467
Q:
To the woman next to you, right?

15:40.467 --> 15:41.767
Let her know,

15:41.767 --> 15:42.933
"My wife thinks I'm out

15:42.933 --> 15:44.567
taking her father
to the hospital."

15:48.400 --> 15:50.467
My --
my wife thinks I'm out

15:50.467 --> 15:52.167
taking her father
to the hospital.

15:52.167 --> 15:54.067
Oh.
Yeah. Yeah.

15:54.067 --> 15:55.267
But I'm on the rides.

15:58.667 --> 16:00.667
Joe,
"What's happening to me."

16:04.233 --> 16:07.300
What's happening to me?

16:07.300 --> 16:09.367
One more time,
one more time.

16:10.633 --> 16:12.767
What is happening to me?

16:12.767 --> 16:13.767
Look at the guy.

16:13.767 --> 16:14.867
The guy
just shot him a look.

16:14.867 --> 16:15.933
He's already trying
to avoid you.

16:15.933 --> 16:16.967
It's great.

16:22.133 --> 16:24.700
Sal:
His stupid face and eyes.

16:24.700 --> 16:26.233
How many rides
do I have to ride

16:26.233 --> 16:27.200
before you notice me?

16:28.667 --> 16:31.967
Murr: Oh! Oh!
That's so weird.

16:31.967 --> 16:34.900
Joe: How many rides
do I have to sit next to you

16:34.900 --> 16:36.067
before you notice me?

16:36.067 --> 16:37.667
How many rides
do I have to sit next to you?

16:37.667 --> 16:40.067
We've ridden
three rides together.

16:40.067 --> 16:41.833
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:41.833 --> 16:44.100
Oh! Ho! Ho!
So weird.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.733
Got to try to have
a little fun

16:46.733 --> 16:49.733
before my wife
craps out another kid.

16:49.733 --> 16:51.867
I got to try
to have some fun

16:51.867 --> 16:53.833
before my wife
craps out another kid.

16:56.300 --> 16:58.200
The whole boat's
uncomfortable.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.300
Q:
When the crate drops,

17:00.300 --> 17:02.067
scream out
"TruTV used to be Court TV."

17:04.400 --> 17:07.067
Joe: Aah!
TruTV used to be Court TV!

17:09.100 --> 17:13.133
After the splash, shout,
"I pulled my fat."

17:13.133 --> 17:15.067
Joe: Aah!

17:16.600 --> 17:20.200
-Oh!
-Oh, yeah!

17:20.200 --> 17:23.400
Joe: I pulled my fat!
I pulled my fat!

17:24.733 --> 17:26.333
We made it.

17:28.533 --> 17:30.733
I have a little surprise today,
guys.
All right.

17:30.733 --> 17:31.967
I'm not gonna go today.

17:31.967 --> 17:34.133
What?
I have my friend

17:34.133 --> 17:36.567
Matthew Lewis,
from the "Harry Potter" movies,

17:36.567 --> 17:38.800
filling in for me today.
Yes!

17:38.800 --> 17:39.967
I finally get a break!

17:39.967 --> 17:41.200
Q: Ah, you learned.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.067
You're bringing a ringer,
eh?

17:43.067 --> 17:44.100
You're taking
his place?

17:44.100 --> 17:45.467
You think
this is a good choice?

17:45.467 --> 17:46.433
Look at how nice he is.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.533
I don't think
it's a good choice.

17:48.533 --> 17:51.267
No, don't say that.
I'm putting my faith in you.
We'll see.

17:51.267 --> 17:52.300
All right, you got it.

17:52.300 --> 17:53.300
It's all up here, okay?

17:53.300 --> 17:54.333
I love you.

17:56.867 --> 17:58.433
Q: There he goes.

17:58.433 --> 17:59.867
I'm gonna make it
look easy.

18:01.133 --> 18:04.567
All aboard.
Here we go, buddy.

18:04.567 --> 18:05.800
Murr:
We want you to clap really big

18:05.800 --> 18:06.833
when the doors open.

18:13.900 --> 18:15.733
Turn to the girl and say,

18:15.733 --> 18:18.100
"I wasn't always this hot.
Soak it in."

18:21.567 --> 18:23.500
You know,
I wasn't always this hot.

18:23.500 --> 18:24.900
You should soak it in.

18:26.700 --> 18:29.067
Look at her face!
Look at her face!

18:29.067 --> 18:32.067
They hate you!
They absolutely hate you!

18:32.067 --> 18:35.067
Matt, turn to the guy
to your left and say,

18:35.067 --> 18:36.400
"Can I smell your hair?"

18:41.767 --> 18:42.967
Can I smell your hair?

18:42.967 --> 18:44.600
No, no.

18:46.600 --> 18:48.100
That's a good call.

18:51.233 --> 18:52.600
In the U.K.,

18:52.600 --> 18:54.567
this boat would be on
the other side of the river.

18:59.300 --> 19:00.967
Matthew:
You know, in the U.K.,

19:00.967 --> 19:02.533
this boat would be on
the other side of the river.

19:02.533 --> 19:04.600
-Yeah.

19:04.600 --> 19:07.200
Murr: So stupid.
We do it the right way,
you see.

19:09.867 --> 19:11.967
That's why the pound
is worth more than the dollar.

19:11.967 --> 19:13.433
That's why the pound

19:13.433 --> 19:14.633
is worth more than the dollar,
you know?

19:14.633 --> 19:16.500
'Cause we do it that way.

19:19.933 --> 19:22.733
Man: You are entering
the raptor containment area.

19:22.733 --> 19:25.167
Murr: Apologies,
I should have showered.

19:26.933 --> 19:29.100
To the whole boat,
to the whole boat.

19:29.100 --> 19:30.067
And then after you say

19:30.067 --> 19:31.800
"apologies,
I should have showered,"

19:31.800 --> 19:34.100
I want you to shout-out
hashtag stank!

19:41.633 --> 19:44.800
Apologies, guys,
I should have showered.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.367
Hashtag stank!

19:47.633 --> 19:48.833
Yes!

19:48.833 --> 19:50.633
-Matthew Lewis for the win.
-Wow.

19:50.633 --> 19:53.367
Joe: Sal, you made
a great choice, buddy.
Murr: Well done.

19:53.367 --> 19:55.733
Narrator: Q couldn't keep
his head above water,

19:55.733 --> 19:58.233
so he's back
on the loser board.

19:58.233 --> 19:59.833
Today we're working
the info booth

19:59.833 --> 20:01.400
here at
Universal Orlando Resort.

20:01.400 --> 20:02.367
While helping parkgoers,

20:02.367 --> 20:03.500
we're gonna
have to do and say

20:03.500 --> 20:04.867
whatever the other guys
tell us to.

20:04.867 --> 20:07.233
If you refuse anything,
you lose.

20:07.233 --> 20:09.700
And that's how you get
into the park for free.

20:09.700 --> 20:11.233
Wait, I paid.

20:11.233 --> 20:12.300
Yep.

20:17.633 --> 20:20.000
Q:
Look at those nipples.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.033
Murr: I know.

20:21.033 --> 20:22.233
But it's 80 degrees
out here.

20:22.233 --> 20:23.300
At this point in your life,

20:23.300 --> 20:24.567
isn't there a surgery
you could have?

20:24.567 --> 20:26.867
A nipple reduction
surgery?

20:28.433 --> 20:29.867
Anybody need directions?

20:29.867 --> 20:31.233
You see Chase
in the background.

20:31.233 --> 20:32.267
He's one of our producers.

20:32.267 --> 20:34.067
That's a really
good-looking guy.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.200
Notice how his nipples

20:35.200 --> 20:37.000
are not poking
through his shirt.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.100
Well, I don't know
what to tell you.

20:38.100 --> 20:42.133
Full head of hair,
great beard, no nipples.

20:42.133 --> 20:44.033
Anybody need information?

20:46.033 --> 20:47.133
Directions?

20:47.133 --> 20:48.667
Murray.
Yes.

20:48.667 --> 20:50.200
When somebody
asks you for directions,

20:50.200 --> 20:51.500
I don't want you
to say a word.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.167
-Hi.
-Hi.

20:58.733 --> 21:00.133
Just don't say anything,
Murr.

21:10.667 --> 21:12.133
No?

21:18.733 --> 21:19.900
Mmm-hmm, mm-hmm.

21:37.100 --> 21:38.700
Thank you.

21:41.233 --> 21:42.833
What are you
looking for?

21:42.833 --> 21:44.067
Oh, your sight's
not too good, buddy.

21:44.067 --> 21:45.167
You got to borrow his glasses
real quick.

21:45.167 --> 21:46.967
So right now,
what we'll do is --

21:46.967 --> 21:49.067
We're right here in H.
Okay.

21:51.233 --> 21:53.067
Now what you can do is,
you can go up here....

21:53.067 --> 21:54.167
Your head's cold.
you got to borrow his hat.

21:54.167 --> 21:55.667
The world of Harry Potter.

21:55.667 --> 21:58.067
'Cause Hogsmeade is over here.
It's great.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.667
I entered
from Hogsmeade.

21:59.667 --> 22:00.867
Oh you did?
So there you go.

22:00.867 --> 22:02.267
Thanks so much for the help.
I appreciate it.

22:02.267 --> 22:03.300
Okay, but --

22:07.433 --> 22:08.833
Q: Here you go.
Here you go.

22:08.833 --> 22:10.067
You need directions?

22:11.300 --> 22:12.300
Come here.

22:12.300 --> 22:13.833
Joe: All right, Murr.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.933
I want you to slowly
lower the umbrella.

22:15.933 --> 22:17.133
So, what --
I did Betty Boop,

22:17.133 --> 22:18.200
and the two in the --
You already did those two?

22:18.200 --> 22:18.867
Yeah.
Okay.

22:18.867 --> 22:20.633
Go down right over here.

22:20.633 --> 22:22.233
You'll see that
what we've got

22:22.233 --> 22:25.433
is right below.

22:25.433 --> 22:26.733
Right there,
you make a left here,

22:26.733 --> 22:28.067
right by the...

22:28.067 --> 22:29.133
Q:
This guy is awesome.

22:29.133 --> 22:31.067
...right by there,
okay?

22:31.067 --> 22:31.933
You make a left.

22:31.933 --> 22:33.300
So over here to the right...

22:33.300 --> 22:35.167
He's giggling like a kid.

22:35.167 --> 22:37.100
Now, do you need to know
where the restrooms are?

22:37.100 --> 22:38.800
Do you need to know
anything else?

22:38.800 --> 22:40.700
Man:  No, I'm okay.
Thank you very much.
That's it?

22:40.700 --> 22:42.067
Okay, you got it man.
Thanks so much.

22:42.067 --> 22:43.933
Now the problem is we're caught
inside this umbrella.

22:43.933 --> 22:45.533
Murr:
Now here's the problem.

22:45.533 --> 22:47.233
You and I, my friend,
are caught inside this umbrella.

22:47.233 --> 22:48.233
Yes, we are.

22:48.233 --> 22:49.367
Joe: So, Murr,
start rolling it

22:49.367 --> 22:50.700
and say
"I have to go with you."

22:50.700 --> 22:52.333
So I have to come with you.

22:52.333 --> 22:53.767
Come with me.
Okay.

22:57.533 --> 22:58.933
Just come with me.
Stay in close.

22:58.933 --> 23:00.400
This might take
a little longer,

23:00.400 --> 23:01.500
but let me tell you, man,

23:01.500 --> 23:03.367
this is the best way
to travel around the park.

23:03.367 --> 23:04.900
Q: I love this guy!

23:04.900 --> 23:08.133
Murr: You and me are in this
adventure together, my friend.

23:08.133 --> 23:09.733
Man:
That's absolutely fine by me.

23:09.733 --> 23:11.700
Yeah, okay, now, we're
gonna make a left here.

23:11.700 --> 23:13.867
A left?
A left, there we go.

23:13.867 --> 23:15.900
Are you a Taurus,
a Capricorn, what are you?

23:15.900 --> 23:17.867
A Pisces, actually.
Pisces, all right.

23:25.567 --> 23:26.967
Sal: Joe...

23:26.967 --> 23:29.233
"Information?"

23:30.900 --> 23:33.067
Information?

23:33.067 --> 23:35.633
I've got some.

23:39.433 --> 23:40.567
Do you need information?

23:45.467 --> 23:46.933
You just came from that way.

23:50.667 --> 23:52.167
Information?

23:52.167 --> 23:53.333
Oh.

23:57.667 --> 24:00.600
Hi, how are you?
Good, how's everything?

24:00.600 --> 24:01.900
I don't think
she's talking to you, bud.

24:01.900 --> 24:03.867
Oh, me?

24:03.867 --> 24:04.800
Yeah.
Oh, no, no.

24:04.800 --> 24:05.767
Is this the maps?

24:08.300 --> 24:09.833
I'm sorry

24:09.833 --> 24:11.600
Yeah.
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

24:11.600 --> 24:13.800
Yeah, so this here.
You got the map.

24:13.800 --> 24:14.867
Okay.
Yeah.

24:14.867 --> 24:15.733
Thank you very much.

24:16.967 --> 24:18.067
I'm sorry?

24:18.067 --> 24:19.333
Thank you very much

24:19.333 --> 24:21.233
for the map.
Oh.

24:21.233 --> 24:23.100
Oh, me?
Oh, okay. Yeah, no.

24:23.100 --> 24:24.233
I thought --
yeah, you look --

24:24.233 --> 24:25.567
You weren't looking at me.

24:25.567 --> 24:27.700
I was looking at you.
Oh, got it.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.500
Woman: Have a good day.
Who?

24:31.267 --> 24:33.333
Who

24:34.600 --> 24:36.600
-Yes!

24:36.600 --> 24:38.067
You have to look at me
when you're talking to --

24:38.067 --> 24:39.500
I thought you were talking
to somebody behind me.

24:39.500 --> 24:41.100
No, no, no.
No.

24:42.167 --> 24:43.400
-See you later.

24:43.400 --> 24:45.300
Yes sir.

24:45.300 --> 24:47.100
Who are you talking to?!

24:49.467 --> 24:51.633
How do you
get out of here?
Oh, me?

24:51.633 --> 24:53.400
Yeah.
You're looking to leave?

24:53.400 --> 24:54.700
Joe, get the kid
to take every pamphlet.

24:54.700 --> 24:57.233
Yeah, you're gonna --

24:57.233 --> 24:58.967
Here, you take that one.
Thank you.

24:58.967 --> 25:00.667
Yeah, there you go.

25:00.667 --> 25:03.133
So this is...

25:03.133 --> 25:04.600
Q: Look at him.
There he goes.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.467
Murr: There he goes.
The kid's got two.

25:08.433 --> 25:09.867
He's just
slipping them to her.

25:11.300 --> 25:13.467
Joe: This is --

25:13.467 --> 25:14.500
This is the info guide.

25:16.900 --> 25:18.967
Okay.
You're looking for the exit.

25:18.967 --> 25:20.633
Oh, no, here you go.
Here you go.

25:22.767 --> 25:24.400
You can't finish your
turn until everything
is off that table.

25:24.400 --> 25:25.833
There. And then --

25:25.833 --> 25:27.300
Just put those in there.

25:27.300 --> 25:29.733
now you have
all the information I had.

25:31.333 --> 25:33.267
You'll probably need these
for school.

25:33.267 --> 25:34.867
So we can just slip them
right in the front there.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.400
Great.
What's your name?
Kylie.

25:36.400 --> 25:38.067
Kylie,
good to see you.

25:38.067 --> 25:39.300
And, uh...

25:42.700 --> 25:44.300
There you go.

25:44.300 --> 25:45.600
In case it rains, okay.

25:45.600 --> 25:47.067
The exit's
straight that way.

25:47.067 --> 25:48.067
There you go.

25:50.133 --> 25:51.267
Q: Sal, look at you.

25:51.267 --> 25:52.233
You're at work.

25:52.233 --> 25:54.067
Everybody's around you
having fun.

25:54.067 --> 25:55.800
Joe: That can't feel good.
That can't.

25:55.800 --> 25:57.900
So whoever comes up
and asks you a question,

25:57.900 --> 26:00.167
I want you to be bitter
that you're working

26:00.167 --> 26:02.433
and they're
enjoying the day.

26:02.433 --> 26:03.900
It's got to be clear
to everybody, Sal.
Yes.

26:03.900 --> 26:05.367
You don't want to be
at work today.

26:05.367 --> 26:07.733
Anybody have any questions,
anyone need directions?

26:07.733 --> 26:09.700
Do you need directions?

26:09.700 --> 26:11.533
What kind of rides
are here?
Oh, my goodness.

26:11.533 --> 26:13.133
There's so many rides
for you and your family

26:13.133 --> 26:14.233
to go on
on this lovely day,

26:14.233 --> 26:15.533
while I sit here
and work all day.

26:18.667 --> 26:20.233
Q:
That's it buddy.

26:20.233 --> 26:23.067
So you must be having a great
family memory right now, right?

26:23.067 --> 26:24.400
-Yeah.
-That's awesome.

26:24.400 --> 26:25.600
My family's home.

26:25.600 --> 26:26.900
Yeah,
I don't get to see them.

26:26.900 --> 26:28.067
I work 70 hours a week.

26:28.067 --> 26:30.133
Do you?
I'm just here
all day every day,

26:30.133 --> 26:31.567
I see the same people,
the same rides

26:31.567 --> 26:32.767
over and over and over.

26:32.767 --> 26:35.500
I get paid every other week
and everything.

26:35.500 --> 26:36.567
I got flat feet.

26:36.567 --> 26:38.900
If you look at my feet here,
see that?

26:38.900 --> 26:39.933
They're killing me.

26:39.933 --> 26:41.367
You need some inserts.

26:41.367 --> 26:42.800
I know.
I do have to get inserts.

26:42.800 --> 26:43.767
I'm saving up for them.

26:43.767 --> 26:45.633
Yeah,
they are expensive.

26:45.633 --> 26:47.133
I also have a $10 gift card
in my pocket

26:47.133 --> 26:48.567
if you answer my question.

26:48.567 --> 26:53.367
I actually have $10 gift cards
if you answer one question.

26:53.367 --> 26:54.733
"While you're having fun
in the park all day..."

26:54.733 --> 26:56.800
Sal: While you're having fun
in the park all day...

26:56.800 --> 26:58.133
Q: "...who's
standing around working,

26:58.133 --> 26:59.700
not having fun?"

26:59.700 --> 27:02.500
...who's standing around working
and not having fun at all,

27:02.500 --> 27:04.733
while his feet hurt?

27:04.733 --> 27:05.600
You.

27:05.600 --> 27:07.367
That's right.
It is me.

27:08.867 --> 27:13.500
Take the $10.
All right, guys.

27:13.500 --> 27:14.933
Yeah, well,
I'll be rock climbing

27:14.933 --> 27:16.200
out of
a pit of depression.

27:20.633 --> 27:23.467
If we want to go to Shrek,
it's in the other park?

27:23.467 --> 27:24.633
I don't know.

27:26.433 --> 27:27.600
Shrek?
Yes.

27:27.600 --> 27:29.133
You want to know
where Shrek is?
Yes.

27:29.133 --> 27:30.067
Uh...

27:30.067 --> 27:32.233
I don't know.

27:34.633 --> 27:36.333
Yeah, but I got
the map for you here.

27:37.700 --> 27:39.900
If I went to this park,

27:39.900 --> 27:42.067
is it possible to change
to the other one?

27:42.067 --> 27:43.700
I don't know.

27:46.067 --> 27:47.500
Joe: Oh, is this
your little guy?

27:47.500 --> 27:48.733
This your little guy
here?
Yes.

27:48.733 --> 27:50.067
You want a lollipop?

27:50.067 --> 27:51.200
You want a lollipop?

27:51.200 --> 27:52.633
Yeah.

27:52.633 --> 27:53.800
Yeah, he doesn't have
any lollipops.

27:53.800 --> 27:56.633
All right,
so Shrek is gonna be --

28:04.167 --> 28:05.600
I don't know.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.433
No, no, you can.

28:07.433 --> 28:08.667
You can go the same day,
same pass.

28:11.400 --> 28:12.933
All right, all right.

28:12.933 --> 28:14.967
Joe: Here we are,
working the information booth.

28:14.967 --> 28:16.133
Oh, you need a map?

28:16.133 --> 28:18.933
Oh, you need directions?
Yeah.

28:18.933 --> 28:20.333
Sure, is there a husband
or a boyfriend

28:20.333 --> 28:21.733
I can explain this to?

28:24.233 --> 28:25.267
Oh, yeah -- is the--

28:25.267 --> 28:26.700
Oh, God up in heaven.

28:26.700 --> 28:28.400
Yes, hi!

28:29.400 --> 28:30.900
Is there a --

28:30.900 --> 28:31.900
Where are we?

28:31.900 --> 28:33.467
Goodbye Q.

28:33.467 --> 28:37.067
Okay, is there a, uh, uh --

28:37.067 --> 28:39.667
Is there a husband
or a boyfriend

28:39.667 --> 28:41.300
I can explain this to?

28:41.300 --> 28:42.433
Oh, great, perfect.

28:42.433 --> 28:43.833
Okay, great.

28:43.833 --> 28:45.400
He's playing to win.

28:45.400 --> 28:46.600
Right around that way.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.067
You can almost see it already
through the trees.

28:48.067 --> 28:49.733
Yeah, just follow him,
just follow him.

28:49.733 --> 28:50.733
I explained it to him.

28:50.733 --> 28:52.067
I can't believe
you said it.

28:52.067 --> 28:53.167
I'm starting to get
a bad feeling

28:53.167 --> 28:54.433
about this episode.

28:54.433 --> 28:55.867
Joe: Well, the road
hasn't been very good to you.

28:55.867 --> 28:57.833
Q: Whoa! Whoa!
What the hell are you doing?

28:57.833 --> 28:58.767
What are you doing?!

28:59.800 --> 29:00.900
What are you doing, don't --

29:00.900 --> 29:02.433
Are you  kidding me?

29:04.167 --> 29:05.633
Oh, my God!

29:05.633 --> 29:08.867
Murr: Oh, Geez! Oh! Ho!
Get out of there!

29:08.867 --> 29:09.767
Oh  guys!

29:14.633 --> 29:16.267
Sal: Oh, my --

29:16.267 --> 29:18.500
What the

29:18.500 --> 29:20.467
Yeah, I know I got to win.

29:20.467 --> 29:22.367
Murr: Q, you work at
an information booth,

29:22.367 --> 29:23.833
but secretly,
you're Tony Gunk,

29:23.833 --> 29:25.633
head of security
for Universal Studios.

29:25.633 --> 29:28.067
Next time somebody
asks for help, frisk them.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.333
Hey, you need help
with anything?

29:30.333 --> 29:31.800
You need help
finding anything?

29:31.800 --> 29:33.533
No, thank you.
No, you got everything?

29:33.533 --> 29:34.633
All right, cool.

29:35.667 --> 29:36.700
Cool.

29:36.700 --> 29:37.767
What's your favorite ride?

29:37.767 --> 29:40.400
What rides have you been on
so far?

29:40.400 --> 29:41.600
What's up?

29:41.600 --> 29:42.733
No, no, it's just
a little extra park security.

29:42.733 --> 29:43.733
Don't worry about it.

29:43.733 --> 29:45.233
What rides have you been on
so far?

29:45.233 --> 29:46.900
Uh...
Are you enjoying it?

29:46.900 --> 29:48.767
Are you enjoying
your experience?

29:48.767 --> 29:50.300
Dude?
Okay.

29:54.167 --> 29:55.500
Oh, that's easy.

29:55.500 --> 29:56.700
I'm gonna give you a map
and I'll show you the way.

29:56.700 --> 29:57.833
"Dad, let me guess..."

29:57.833 --> 29:59.167
Dad?
Yep.

29:59.167 --> 30:00.200
Let me guess...

30:00.200 --> 30:01.233
"...second family?"

30:03.600 --> 30:05.467
...you got these kids
into reading comic books,

30:05.467 --> 30:07.367
when you had to read
to them?

30:07.367 --> 30:08.367
Got you!

30:08.367 --> 30:09.767
You got me,
you definitely got me.

30:11.433 --> 30:13.500
Narrator:
Q headed in the wrong direction,

30:13.500 --> 30:16.700
so he's doing triple time
on the loser board.

30:16.700 --> 30:18.800
Today we are at
Islands of Adventure

30:18.800 --> 30:20.500
playing
one of our favorite games --

30:20.500 --> 30:21.900
have you seen my wife?

30:21.900 --> 30:23.100
While searching the park,

30:23.100 --> 30:25.367
the other guys will give us
a ridiculous description

30:25.367 --> 30:27.000
of our so-called wives.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.167
If you can't get someone to say

30:28.167 --> 30:29.467
they've seen
that wife of yours,

30:29.467 --> 30:30.433
you lose.

30:30.433 --> 30:33.100
All right, guys,
let's do it.

30:33.100 --> 30:35.000
Have you seen three guys?

30:38.633 --> 30:39.700
Q: In this sunlight,

30:39.700 --> 30:42.033
you look like the guy
from "Powder."

30:42.033 --> 30:43.500
Yes, he does.
He does, right?

30:43.500 --> 30:45.800
Sal: "Powder?
Like "Powder."
You look like "Powder."

30:48.133 --> 30:50.633
Guys, which way did you
come from in the park?

30:50.633 --> 30:51.500
Uh, that way.

30:51.500 --> 30:52.833
You came from that way?
Yeah.

30:52.833 --> 30:54.567
I went to get coffee
for my wife,

30:54.567 --> 30:56.500
and she's gone,
and I can't find her.

30:56.500 --> 30:57.533
Did you see a woman...

30:57.533 --> 30:58.833
She won't stop
eating bananas

30:58.833 --> 31:00.533
and making
eye contact.

31:00.533 --> 31:02.967
...my wife won't stop
eating bananas

31:02.967 --> 31:04.700
and she makes eye contact
too much.

31:04.700 --> 31:06.233
Did you see anybody
like that?

31:06.233 --> 31:07.833
She's rolling with a posse
of young Hasidic girls.

31:07.833 --> 31:10.500
She's rolling with a posse
of young Hasidic girls.

31:10.500 --> 31:13.167
Did you see like a whole gaggle
of Hasidic girls?

31:13.167 --> 31:15.800
No, we did not.
With a woman,
an older woman?

31:15.800 --> 31:17.800
Body like
a calabaza squash.

31:17.800 --> 31:18.833
Her body --

31:18.833 --> 31:21.067
she has the body
of a calabaza squash.

31:21.067 --> 31:23.067
She's very recognizable.

31:23.067 --> 31:24.700
Her maiden name is Scrum.

31:24.700 --> 31:26.267
Her maiden name is Scrum.

31:28.300 --> 31:31.367
If you see her around,
tell her Mr. Scrum wants her.

31:31.367 --> 31:33.067
Okay, we will do that.
Okay, thanks.

31:33.067 --> 31:34.067
No, her maiden name
is Scrum.

31:34.067 --> 31:34.967
Scrum
is her maiden name!

31:34.967 --> 31:36.067
Oh, wait,
it's her maiden name.

31:36.067 --> 31:37.900
When we married,
I took her maiden name.

31:37.900 --> 31:40.133
Fair enough, we--
I'm a modern man.

31:40.133 --> 31:41.867
Doris Scrum?

31:41.867 --> 31:44.167
Has anyone seen
Doris Scrum.

31:46.067 --> 31:47.800
Sir, did you just come
from that way?

31:47.800 --> 31:48.967
I did.
I lost my wife.

31:48.967 --> 31:50.467
Did you see
a woman down there?

31:50.467 --> 31:51.633
She was, um...

31:51.633 --> 31:53.767
Her pants don't work.
...her pants don't work.

31:53.767 --> 31:55.567
Did you see somebody
down there like that?
Unh-unh.

31:55.567 --> 31:56.833
You didn't see anyone.

31:56.833 --> 31:57.867
It looks like
she's doing the hula hoop,

31:57.867 --> 31:58.933
but that's how she walks.

31:58.933 --> 32:00.267
It looks like
she's doing the hula hoop,

32:00.267 --> 32:01.333
she kind of --
I didn't see her.

32:01.333 --> 32:02.600
But that's how she walks.
She kind of --

32:02.600 --> 32:04.100
She's got that --
I didn't see her.

32:04.100 --> 32:05.300
She's cracking
her knuckles

32:05.300 --> 32:07.067
in a way that calls for
a divorce attorney.

32:07.067 --> 32:08.933
She's cracking her knuckles

32:08.933 --> 32:11.433
in a way that's calling
for a divorce attorney.

32:11.433 --> 32:13.333
You didn't see anybody
down there like that?

32:13.333 --> 32:14.500
No, I did not.
Darn it!

32:14.500 --> 32:16.067
What am I supposed to do?
I don't know.

32:16.067 --> 32:17.767
I lost my wife.
Maybe that guy down there
saw her.

32:17.767 --> 32:18.700
Wait, that's her.

32:18.700 --> 32:20.500
Wait, that's her!

32:20.500 --> 32:23.133
Doris! Doris Scrum.

32:23.133 --> 32:24.300
Hi, how are you?
It's great to see you.

32:24.300 --> 32:25.767
just give me a hug here.

32:29.667 --> 32:32.133
-I'm looking for my wife.

32:32.133 --> 32:33.433
I lost my wife?

32:35.200 --> 32:36.800
No, no, I can't find her.
Oh!

32:36.800 --> 32:37.800
He goes, "she died?"

32:38.967 --> 32:40.867
She went that way.
You guys came from this way.

32:40.867 --> 32:41.967
Did you see a woman...

32:41.967 --> 32:43.467
She's got
diabetes 1 through 4.

32:44.967 --> 32:46.067
Did you guys see her
at all?

32:46.067 --> 32:47.200
She has
diabetes 1 through 4?

32:47.200 --> 32:48.267
Oh, no.

32:48.267 --> 32:50.367
Picture if Regis Philbin
was a younger woman.

32:50.367 --> 32:53.767
She looks like if Regis Philbin
was a younger woman.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.333
Her tongue doesn't fit
all the way in her mouth.

32:59.333 --> 33:01.400
Her tongue doesn't fit
all the way in her mouth.

33:01.400 --> 33:04.600
She went this way.
You came from that way.

33:04.600 --> 33:06.567
If you feed her after midnight,
she enters a cocoon.

33:06.567 --> 33:08.967
If you feed her
after midnight,

33:08.967 --> 33:12.867
she enters
into a cocoon state.

33:12.867 --> 33:14.167
If you get water
on her...

33:14.167 --> 33:15.267
Q:
If you get water on her...

33:15.267 --> 33:16.567
...she creates offspring.

33:16.567 --> 33:18.500
...if you get water on her,
she creates offspring.

33:18.500 --> 33:20.233
And if you put her
in direct sunlight,

33:20.233 --> 33:21.467
she dies.

33:21.467 --> 33:22.767
If you put her
in direct sunlight, she dies.

33:22.767 --> 33:24.233
This is all serious stuff.

33:24.233 --> 33:25.633
Oh,  I'm sorry.

33:25.633 --> 33:27.333
I can probably go pick up
another one in Chinatown

33:27.333 --> 33:28.667
in the back of a shop.

33:30.533 --> 33:31.933
No, no,
but in all seriousness...

33:31.933 --> 33:33.167
You remember Macy Gray?

33:33.167 --> 33:34.200
...you remember
Macy Gray?

33:34.200 --> 33:35.233
You remember
the singer Macy Gray?

33:35.233 --> 33:36.200
She's Macy Gray.

33:36.200 --> 33:37.133
She's Macy Gray.

33:41.200 --> 33:42.533
No, we haven't seen her.
Haven't seen her, sorry.

33:42.533 --> 33:43.767
-No.

33:43.767 --> 33:44.833
Joe: I'll tell you what.

33:44.833 --> 33:46.600
If Macy Gray's
walking around Universal,

33:46.600 --> 33:47.800
she's gonna be found.

33:47.800 --> 33:49.200
Excuse me.

33:49.200 --> 33:50.733
Murr: Okay, Sal, this time,
you're looking for your grandma.

33:50.733 --> 33:53.133
I'm looking for my --
my, uh, grandmother.

33:53.133 --> 33:54.367
Did you see a woman...

33:54.367 --> 33:56.133
She's got fun bags
down to her knees.

33:56.133 --> 33:58.633
...she's got fun bags
down to her knees?

33:58.633 --> 34:00.200
How old is your grandma?
She's in her late 80s.

34:00.200 --> 34:01.433
Late 80s.

34:01.433 --> 34:03.900
She's riding a Rascal,
flipping off everybody.

34:03.900 --> 34:05.367
She's on a Rascal.

34:05.367 --> 34:07.067
She was flipping everybody off.

34:07.067 --> 34:08.567
She's gone through
three menopauses.

34:08.567 --> 34:11.900
She -- oh, hey, kids.

34:11.900 --> 34:13.367
The first two menopauses
didn't take.

34:13.367 --> 34:14.800
Joe:

34:14.800 --> 34:16.267
You can tell
she was an ugly baby.

34:16.267 --> 34:17.867
You can tell
she was an ugly baby.

34:17.867 --> 34:18.967
Limps for attention.

34:18.967 --> 34:19.933
She limps for attention.

34:19.933 --> 34:20.967
You got to look out for her.

34:22.767 --> 34:24.667
I'm not doing her justice.

34:24.667 --> 34:26.533
She looks like
a bunch of flounder

34:26.533 --> 34:27.867
got slammed in a car door.

34:27.867 --> 34:29.667
She looks like
a bunch of flounder

34:29.667 --> 34:31.200
got slammed
into a car door.

34:31.200 --> 34:33.867
No, no,
that's how she looks!

34:35.267 --> 34:36.900
Let's -- let's just recap
what we have her.

34:36.900 --> 34:38.167
Her fun bags
are down to her toes,

34:38.167 --> 34:39.467
she's gone through
three menopauses,

34:39.467 --> 34:41.100
she's on a Rascal
flipping everybody off,

34:41.100 --> 34:43.067
and she looks like
a bunch of flounder

34:43.067 --> 34:44.333
got slammed into a car door.

34:44.333 --> 34:45.400
You can't help me out?

34:45.400 --> 34:47.367
I can't describe this woman
any further!

34:48.633 --> 34:50.200
You didn't see
anyone like at?
No, sir.

34:50.200 --> 34:51.633
All right,
pleasure to meet you, sir.

34:54.367 --> 34:57.133
Is there water rides
that way, too?
I don't think so.

34:57.133 --> 34:58.633
I think it's here to there,
right, cause I told my --

34:58.633 --> 34:59.333
I lost my wife.

34:59.333 --> 35:00.567
Did you see a woman...

35:00.567 --> 35:02.167
She's always carrying
a sack of talc.

35:02.167 --> 35:04.467
...she was carrying
a sack of talc.

35:04.467 --> 35:05.667
Q:
She looks like The Rock

35:05.667 --> 35:07.633
if he only ate
fettuccine alfredo.

35:07.633 --> 35:09.400
She looks like The Rock

35:09.400 --> 35:12.300
if he only ate
fettuccine alfredo.
Okay.

35:12.300 --> 35:14.433
If he was on a strict
fettuccine alfredo diet,

35:14.433 --> 35:15.700
The Rock -- that's it.

35:15.700 --> 35:18.067
She's what the French
would call misérable.

35:18.067 --> 35:19.867
She's what the French
would call, uh,

35:19.867 --> 35:21.333
misérable.

35:21.333 --> 35:23.067
She looks like
what the Italians would call

35:23.067 --> 35:24.433
a broccoli rabe.

35:24.433 --> 35:25.633
You couldn't miss her.

35:25.633 --> 35:27.433
She's what the Italians
would call a broccoli rabe,

35:27.433 --> 35:28.900
what the French
would call misérable,

35:28.900 --> 35:30.767
or The Rock eating
fettuccine alfredo.

35:30.767 --> 35:33.067
Okay.

35:33.067 --> 35:34.567
Well, I'm just trying
to give you as many
details as I can.

35:34.567 --> 35:36.667
She's got one blue eye...
She's got one blue eye...

35:36.667 --> 35:38.600
...and one wooden eye.
...and one wooden eye.

35:38.600 --> 35:39.700
None of this
is ringing a bell.

35:39.700 --> 35:40.800
You haven't seen her?
I never saw her.

35:40.800 --> 35:43.100
Big trash bags
under her all-white eyes.

35:43.100 --> 35:45.100
Big trash bags
under her all-white eyes --

35:45.100 --> 35:46.433
one wooden, one blue.

35:46.433 --> 35:47.733
Carrying a sack of talc.

35:47.733 --> 35:49.433
All serious, all serious.

35:49.433 --> 35:50.900
All seriousness...
She's wearing sunglasses...

35:50.900 --> 35:52.333
...she's wearing
sunglasses...
...a hat...

35:52.333 --> 35:53.600
...a hat...
...and she's made
of metal.

35:53.600 --> 35:54.700
...and she's made
of metal.

35:56.367 --> 35:57.600
You didn't see her?
That's why.

35:57.600 --> 35:58.833
She's got to do
a better job.

36:01.400 --> 36:02.500
Joe: Guys.

36:02.500 --> 36:03.733
We're gonna switch up
who you're looking for.

36:03.733 --> 36:05.833
Do you know if
the Jurassic Ride is that way?

36:05.833 --> 36:07.800
Yeah, you go up here
and turn right.

36:07.800 --> 36:09.067
I'm looking for
my twin brother.

36:09.067 --> 36:11.233
Murr: His twin brother?
Twin?

36:11.233 --> 36:13.267
Oh, okay. Like, yeah,
I'm looking for my twin brother.

36:13.267 --> 36:14.333
You would have seen his nose

36:14.333 --> 36:15.500
a couple of minutes
before his body.

36:15.500 --> 36:16.700
You walk past King Kong

36:16.700 --> 36:17.800
and just keep
right on going.
Yeah?

36:17.800 --> 36:19.067
You would have seen his nose

36:19.067 --> 36:20.767
a couple of minutes
before his body, you know?

36:20.767 --> 36:22.067
No, guys, I got it.
I got it.

36:22.067 --> 36:23.433
He eats donuts
by the dozen.

36:23.433 --> 36:24.767
He look like
an Italian Weeble Wobble.

36:26.867 --> 36:28.600
He looks like he's always
in a state of melting.

36:28.600 --> 36:31.133
He looks like a troll doll
in hospice.

36:31.133 --> 36:32.900
Sounds like quite a guy.
He's quite a fellow.

36:32.900 --> 36:34.133
I'd like to party with him.

36:34.133 --> 36:36.067
He looks like the butter
after it's on the popcorn.

36:36.067 --> 36:37.533
Yeah,
he looks like Steve Carell

36:37.533 --> 36:38.800
at the end of the line,
you know what I mean?

36:38.800 --> 36:39.600
Just before it goes out.

36:39.600 --> 36:40.533
Definitely wont live to see

36:40.533 --> 36:41.467
his daughter's graduation...

36:41.467 --> 36:42.533
from kindergarten.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.233
He's my twin brother.

36:46.233 --> 36:47.733
Yeah, I can imagine
the resemblance.

36:47.733 --> 36:49.400
H-He's this.

36:51.067 --> 36:52.133
I'm gonna keep moving here.
Keep moving.

36:52.133 --> 36:53.700
Yeah, it was nice.
Good luck there.

36:53.700 --> 36:55.500
Yeah, he was born most likely
to lose all his money.

37:00.067 --> 37:02.567
Joe:
Those are some luscious locks
you got going there, buddy.

37:02.567 --> 37:04.067
Your hair looks great,
you look like a hot mop.

37:04.067 --> 37:06.267
I look like a hot mop?
Yeah, like a hot mop.

37:06.267 --> 37:07.833
You look like a mop
I'd date.

37:07.833 --> 37:09.433
You know what?
That's the kindest thing

37:09.433 --> 37:10.733
you've said about my looks
on this show.

37:10.733 --> 37:11.800
I'll take it.

37:13.767 --> 37:15.167
All right, you guys are wet.
You went on a water ride.

37:15.167 --> 37:16.233
I'm looking for my wife.

37:16.233 --> 37:17.267
I wonder if you saw her?

37:17.267 --> 37:18.967
She looks like
a tin of old ham.

37:18.967 --> 37:20.900
She looks like
a tin of old ham,

37:20.900 --> 37:21.867
like her face.

37:21.867 --> 37:22.967
Did you see her?

37:22.967 --> 37:25.500
Heavy ears.
Heavy, really heavy ears.

37:25.500 --> 37:26.733
A mild sheen.

37:26.733 --> 37:29.267
She's got like
a mild sheen on her, you know?

37:29.267 --> 37:31.167
Like, looks like an oil slick
at all times?

37:31.167 --> 37:32.333
Man: Yes, yes, yes.

37:32.333 --> 37:34.067
If a caricature artist
drew her...

37:34.067 --> 37:35.367
If a caricature artist
drew her...

37:35.367 --> 37:36.467
...she would look normal.

37:36.467 --> 37:37.500
...she would look normal.

37:37.500 --> 37:38.567
You know what I mean?

37:38.567 --> 37:39.733
You know what I'm saying?

37:39.733 --> 37:41.167
I love her very much.
I mean, love of my life.

37:41.167 --> 37:42.433
You know what
a Christmas tree looks like?

37:42.433 --> 37:44.067
Q: You know what
a Christmas tree looks like?

37:44.067 --> 37:46.367
Take all the balls off...
Take all the balls off...

37:46.367 --> 37:47.867
...all the tinsel off...
...all the tinsel off...

37:47.867 --> 37:49.767
...the star off the top...
...the star off the top...

37:49.767 --> 37:50.933
...peel all
he branches off...

37:50.933 --> 37:52.133
...peel all
the branches off...

37:52.133 --> 37:53.167
...that's her.

37:53.167 --> 37:54.867
...and that's her.
That's my wife.

37:56.067 --> 37:57.300
-Sorry.
-Sorry, man.

37:58.333 --> 38:01.200
Excuse me, ladies,
I lost my wife.

38:01.200 --> 38:03.967
I'm wondering
if you spotted her anywhere?

38:03.967 --> 38:05.067
Oh, I'm glad you asked.

38:05.067 --> 38:06.067
She's um...

38:06.067 --> 38:07.133
Joe: She's got a mouth

38:07.133 --> 38:08.767
that oozes
what looks like chocolate.

38:08.767 --> 38:10.667
She's got like a --

38:10.667 --> 38:11.767
She's got a mouth --

38:11.767 --> 38:14.067
No, no mustache,
thank god.

38:14.067 --> 38:15.633
No, no, no,
she's got a mouth that --

38:15.633 --> 38:17.833
it oozes what looks like
chocolate.

38:17.833 --> 38:19.733
She's generally --
It's not chocolate, but --

38:21.667 --> 38:23.067
She's not sick.
It's more of a condition.

38:23.067 --> 38:25.400
She's walking around
spouting out knock-knock jokes

38:25.400 --> 38:26.767
that end with
the same punch line.

38:26.767 --> 38:28.833
She's been spouting out
knock-knock jokes

38:28.833 --> 38:29.900
that have the same punch line --
every one.

38:29.900 --> 38:31.367
deez nuts --
every knock-knock joke.

38:31.367 --> 38:32.733
Every knock-knock joke.
-No.

38:32.733 --> 38:34.367
That's her, oozes chocolate
a little bit?

38:34.367 --> 38:35.400
-No.
-No.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.067
She ate an iguana
on the Internet.

38:37.067 --> 38:38.600
Are you on
the Internet at all?

38:38.600 --> 38:40.067
She's famous,
she ate an iguana,

38:40.067 --> 38:41.500
a whole iguana
on the Internet.

38:41.500 --> 38:42.833
Oh, you know her?
Did you see her?

38:42.833 --> 38:44.067
Oh, yes! Yes! Yes!

38:44.067 --> 38:45.367
Yeah!
Did you see her around here?

38:45.367 --> 38:46.367
Yeah, yeah.

38:46.367 --> 38:47.933
Oh, which way was she?

38:47.933 --> 38:48.867
That way.

38:48.867 --> 38:50.233
That way? Oh!

38:50.233 --> 38:51.467
Thank you so much!

38:51.467 --> 38:52.833
Well done!

38:52.833 --> 38:54.500
Knock knock!
Who's there?

38:54.500 --> 38:55.967
Deez.
Deez who?

38:55.967 --> 38:57.067
Deez nuts!

38:58.900 --> 39:00.867
Narrator:
Q may have found his wife,

39:00.867 --> 39:04.067
but he's still
tonight's big loser.

39:04.067 --> 39:06.967
Well, time's up
here in Florida, friend.

39:06.967 --> 39:08.667
Q, you have lost
this episode,

39:08.667 --> 39:10.733
so we are here at
the Toon Lagoon Amphitheater

39:10.733 --> 39:12.500
where you
are going to be part of

39:12.500 --> 39:13.867
our very own
stunt show.

39:13.867 --> 39:15.133
Stunt show.

39:15.133 --> 39:16.800
You're gonna be
the spider hero.

39:16.800 --> 39:18.967
Okay, got it,
the spider hero.

39:18.967 --> 39:20.400
So this is the spider hero?

39:21.967 --> 39:24.433
This doesn't feel like
a superhero costume.

39:24.433 --> 39:25.833
Put your hands
in the air.

39:29.533 --> 39:30.933
Joe: 1,500 parkgoers

39:30.933 --> 39:32.900
decided to come see
this stunt spectacular.

39:32.900 --> 39:34.667
They're expecting
a spectacular.

39:34.667 --> 39:37.800
I used to be a fireman.

39:37.800 --> 39:38.967
Like, I used to be useful.

39:38.967 --> 39:40.233
Spiders are useful.

39:40.233 --> 39:41.567
They kill mosquitoes.
That's right.

39:41.567 --> 39:42.700
Yeah,
but I'm not even a spider.

39:42.700 --> 39:44.400
I'm just a douche
dressed like a spider.

39:44.400 --> 39:45.833
Grab the spider by the legs.
Let's do this.

39:45.833 --> 39:48.300
And once the music starts,
go.

39:48.300 --> 39:50.833
**

39:50.833 --> 39:53.333
Yeah!

39:53.333 --> 39:54.800
Put the arms up, bud!

39:54.800 --> 39:58.967
**

39:58.967 --> 40:01.733
Oh, my God.
there's so many people.

40:01.733 --> 40:04.333
Sal: Q, you have to act out
all the spider lines.

40:04.333 --> 40:06.033
Man: Hi, everyone!

40:06.033 --> 40:09.467
I'm a spider,
and I know karate!

40:09.467 --> 40:10.467
Spider kick!

40:10.467 --> 40:11.467
Hyah!

40:11.467 --> 40:12.467

40:19.867 --> 40:21.300
Joe:
Try to do the dance.

40:21.300 --> 40:22.567
Do the dance, Q!

40:22.567 --> 40:24.133
* We all love the barnyard

40:24.133 --> 40:25.667

40:25.667 --> 40:28.033

40:29.333 --> 40:31.333
What --
I feel like I've taken acid.

40:31.333 --> 40:34.100
Man:
Oh, no, barnyard friends!

40:34.100 --> 40:36.167
That mischievous Cow
is back...

40:36.167 --> 40:39.700
Oh, the Cow!
...and she's trying
to destroy my pig pen.

40:39.700 --> 40:42.467
Have no fear!
Spider is here!

40:42.467 --> 40:47.333
I may be small,
but I'm a "handy" guy.

40:47.333 --> 40:51.567
Cow, time for you to take
the "milky way" out of here.

40:51.567 --> 40:53.767
One thing
we forgot to mention.

40:53.767 --> 40:56.067
Inside the cow costume
is a jujitsu master.de the cow e

40:57.500 --> 40:58.667
Aw, don't --

41:09.333 --> 41:11.167
If you listen to
the prerecorded play,

41:11.167 --> 41:12.833
he was supposed to be
beating up the cow.

41:12.833 --> 41:14.933
Ow, stop!
Spider jab!

41:18.367 --> 41:21.267
You haven't seen
the last of me, spider.

41:21.267 --> 41:22.267
Q: Oh, God, please --

41:22.267 --> 41:23.833
Go. You got to dance!

Why am I getting
flipped around?

Wait, am I the hero?

41:33.500 --> 41:37.800
I'm too chicken to "moove"
that cow from my coop.

41:37.800 --> 41:39.233
Oh, no.
The chicken's got a problem.

41:39.233 --> 41:40.533
Oh, no,
I'm not doing this again.

41:40.533 --> 41:41.767
Spider,

41:41.767 --> 41:43.233
Look out, cow!

42:06.533 --> 42:07.800
Murr: So, the whole point
of this show

42:07.800 --> 42:09.800
was just to kick the
out of Q.

42:09.800 --> 42:11.400
Take that and that!

42:14.633 --> 42:17.667

43:53.500 --> 43:55.533
This guy just got
pretty embarrassed out there

at Universal Studios.

Welcome.
Welcome to the party.

44:13.933 --> 44:16.133
This is Q's punishment
that's about to happen.

44:16.233 --> 44:18.133
It's a Spectacular,
Stunt-Man Spectacular,

44:18.233 --> 44:20.067
which it ain't gonna be
spectacular.

44:20.333 --> 44:21.467
Pete:
Q loves superheroes,

44:21.567 --> 44:22.967
so Q thinks
he's gonna have to do

44:23.067 --> 44:25.400
a superhero
stunt spectacular,

44:25.500 --> 44:27.800
and he realizes that,
no, it's a kid's show.

44:27.900 --> 44:29.933
And then he realizes that,

44:30.067 --> 44:31.333
"Oh, even though
it is a kid's show,

44:31.433 --> 44:33.067
I'm still gonna
get my ass kicked."

44:33.167 --> 44:34.133
Man: Look out, cow!

44:34.233 --> 44:35.767
Spider charge!

44:37.400 --> 44:39.067
Spider uppercut!

44:39.167 --> 44:41.567
Spider head butt!

44:41.667 --> 44:43.500
Moo, earthy!

44:43.967 --> 44:45.933
Joe: Well, time's up here
in Florida, friend.

44:46.067 --> 44:47.767
You guys cannot put
any more spiders on me.

44:47.867 --> 44:49.733
I already did that.
Nah, been there, done that.

44:49.833 --> 44:51.067
Yeah, all right.

44:51.133 --> 44:52.600
Oh, and don't worry.
There's no twist.

44:54.233 --> 44:55.867
God, please.

44:59.667 --> 45:01.700
Why do I keep getting
tossed into things

45:01.800 --> 45:02.833
by a  cow?

45:05.067 --> 45:07.233
So, you just nailed it
out there.

45:07.333 --> 45:08.833
Yeah?
This is the cow.

45:08.933 --> 45:10.300
The cow goes "hyah!"

45:10.400 --> 45:12.433
Q:

45:12.533 --> 45:13.633
Pyah! Pyuh!

45:13.733 --> 45:15.233
The choreographer,
himself.

45:15.333 --> 45:16.567
Thank you!

45:16.667 --> 45:18.833
Thank you, guys. Thank you!

45:18.933 --> 45:20.933
Thank you. I appreciate it.
Please.

45:21.067 --> 45:23.933
Murr: Go get that nasty cow,
spider hero!

45:24.067 --> 45:25.233
Get in the cannon?

45:25.333 --> 45:27.267
Yes!

45:29.500 --> 45:32.733
Oh, my God.

45:32.833 --> 45:33.733
This is insane.

45:33.833 --> 45:35.067
Joe:

45:35.100 --> 45:38.467
3, 2, 1...
What am I doing?

45:38.567 --> 45:39.867
Blast off!

45:44.533 --> 45:46.300
Murr:
Nothing!

45:46.400 --> 45:48.300
It doesn't work!

45:48.500 --> 45:50.067
How many days did it take you
to build all this stuff?

45:50.167 --> 45:52.600
All this stuff
or the cannon?
All the stuff.

45:52.700 --> 45:55.400
Um, four or five days,
probably.

45:55.500 --> 45:56.767
Did you get to go on
any rides?

45:56.867 --> 45:58.200
I haven't been
on a single ride.

45:58.300 --> 45:59.333
No rides.

45:59.433 --> 46:01.067
I've been working straight
building that set.

46:01.267 --> 46:02.467
I think what
really helped was

46:02.567 --> 46:03.933
so many people
came out to see it.

46:04.067 --> 46:06.433
There was
just like 1,500 people

46:06.533 --> 46:07.633
who could have been
on roller coasters,

46:07.733 --> 46:09.133
having cotton candy,

46:09.233 --> 46:11.433
they're seeing a cow
flipping a spider,

46:11.533 --> 46:13.067
an old spider dude.

46:13.133 --> 46:14.433
Did everybody know how much
you had to do with it?

46:14.533 --> 46:16.167
Let me tell you
a little bit about him.

46:16.267 --> 46:17.300
He did so much work.

46:17.400 --> 46:19.467
What did you do for it?
I did the music Cs.

46:19.567 --> 46:20.467
Yes, you had the voice-overs.

46:20.567 --> 46:21.867
He wrote it,
and then edited it,

46:21.967 --> 46:23.133
and he played
all the sounds.

46:23.233 --> 46:24.533
Casey:
And this is my music studio.

46:24.633 --> 46:27.400
I have to do four voices.

46:27.500 --> 46:29.500
* Welcome to the barnyard

46:29.600 --> 46:31.433
* We all love the barnyard

46:31.533 --> 46:33.433
* Come on see the barnyard

46:33.533 --> 46:35.267
* Barnyard, yay

46:35.367 --> 46:36.800
It sounds
like this when you're done.

46:36.900 --> 46:38.667
* Welcome to the barnyard

46:38.767 --> 46:40.933
* We all love the barnyard

46:41.067 --> 46:42.833
* Come on see the barnyard

46:42.933 --> 46:44.833
* Barnyard, yay

46:44.933 --> 46:46.067
Hey, welcome to
"Impractical Insider."

46:46.133 --> 46:47.467
I'm just going to get
sentimental for a moment.

46:47.567 --> 46:50.167
Just saying, great job.
Aw, thank you buddy.

46:50.267 --> 46:53.100
Real moments you only see
here on "Impractical Insider."

46:53.200 --> 46:54.267
* If you mess with me

46:54.367 --> 46:55.667
* I'll smack you upside
that head *

46:55.767 --> 46:58.200
* That cow better not
show her face *

46:58.300 --> 47:00.500
* Or I'm gonna put her
right in her place *

47:00.600 --> 47:01.500
Oh, yeah!

47:01.600 --> 47:03.200
Q: Yeah!

47:03.300 --> 47:05.067
* Yeah, there's a donkey
on the end *

47:05.133 --> 47:06.533
* And he's not my friend

47:06.633 --> 47:07.967
* He put me on the stage,

47:08.067 --> 47:09.967
* And now I want him...
to get...sick *

47:11.233 --> 47:13.800
* And now we got a little fox

47:13.900 --> 47:16.367
* I kind of think
that he looks like an ox *

47:16.467 --> 47:18.967
* But if that cow comes back,
I'm gonna make him look silly *

47:19.067 --> 47:22.200
* Because that's what I do
with my...willy *

47:22.300 --> 47:23.900
Aw, yeah.

47:24.067 --> 47:25.167
Oh, no.

47:29.133 --> 47:30.167
Joe: Good work, buddy!

47:30.267 --> 47:31.467
And that's
how you do Orlando.

47:31.567 --> 47:33.367
* Barnyard, bye

47:33.467 --> 47:34.400
Man: All right, everybody,

47:34.500 --> 47:36.933
let's get on the stage
for the picture.

47:37.067 --> 47:39.400
They won't let him
out of the costume.

47:39.500 --> 47:42.267
How many photos
do we have to take?

47:42.367 --> 47:43.833
The punishment continues.
