02:30.443 --> 02:33.230
I was thinking...

02:33.362 --> 02:35.648
I was thinking...

02:36.824 --> 02:38.906
you and I might go away to Baia.

02:40.578 --> 02:43.661
After next market day.
It's supposed to be nice there.

02:43.789 --> 02:46.952
— Seeing how crowded it's been...
— A lovely idea, but...

02:47.084 --> 02:48.494
But what?

02:49.211 --> 02:51.543
I can't leave Lyde alone.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.880
— She needs me.
— She needs you.

02:55.009 --> 02:57.671
Evander's been missing two months. It's bad.

02:57.803 --> 03:01.716
Very likely something bad has happened.
Very likely he is dead!

03:14.195 --> 03:16.231
Pullo, awake!

03:18.324 --> 03:22.988
- Wake up! Mark Antony's waiting.
— Mump off and die, you pig fucker.

03:26.749 --> 03:28.614
Right.

03:32.922 --> 03:35.004
Thank you, my honey.

03:35.132 --> 03:36.963
You shouldn't thank slaves.

03:37.093 --> 03:39.254
— No harm in it.
— It's bad for discipline.

03:39.387 --> 03:41.548
Happy again this morning?

03:42.598 --> 03:44.964
Niobe, then? How's she going?

03:45.101 --> 03:48.639
I don't understand her.
All the hoo over her sister's damn husband.

03:48.771 --> 03:51.433
Women? Maybe she's...

03:51.565 --> 03:53.942
She's what?

03:54.068 --> 03:56.730
I don't know. Women?

04:19.844 --> 04:22.506
Mighty vice—conqueror of Gaul,

04:22.638 --> 04:26.381
Mars and Bellona swell
with pride at your doings.

04:26.517 --> 04:29.725
— And I say...
— Good Juno, what cack you speak.

04:29.854 --> 04:34.223
— Would you just get on with your point, man?
- Immediately, your honour.

04:34.358 --> 04:36.644
Publius Servilius is here.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.314
Good. That'll do for this crowd, then.
Off with you.

04:39.447 --> 04:42.154
- I...
— No, off with you!

04:42.283 --> 04:47.277
Master of horse and people's tribune Mark
Antony will receive your petitions tomorrow.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.031
Vorenus.

04:53.335 --> 04:55.291
Out!

04:55.421 --> 04:58.538
Cynthia, a pear, my love.

05:10.561 --> 05:14.304
Servilius, my dear old friend.

05:16.192 --> 05:20.276
- How are you?
— Healthy. Healthy, I thank you.

05:20.404 --> 05:23.862
Forgive me, have we met before?

05:23.991 --> 05:27.028
Have we not? No idea.

05:27.161 --> 05:29.903
| always pretend so with civilians.

05:30.039 --> 05:32.325
It's more politic.

05:34.793 --> 05:39.708
And this must be your beautiful wife,
whose name escapes me.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.547
— Poppaea.
— A flower.

05:44.011 --> 05:49.551
You'll excuse all the bustle.
I found Pompey's taste in decor rather dull.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.184
I like a little more colour.

05:51.310 --> 05:54.643
- As you say.
— You shall make it lovely, we are sure.

05:54.772 --> 05:57.388
Forgive me if I talk
business with your husband?

05:57.525 --> 06:01.109
Of course. Pretend I'm not here.

06:01.237 --> 06:06.402
Impossible. But I shall try. Now, then...

06:06.534 --> 06:11.073
I'm sure you're aware Caesar has left
me in charge whilst he is in Greece.

06:11.205 --> 06:15.073
Off having fun chastising Pompey et al.

06:15.209 --> 06:18.793
Left me here to scribble
and quibble like a damned civilian.

06:18.921 --> 06:22.755
However, I am determined
to make the most of it.

06:22.883 --> 06:26.216
I shall be a good politician, even if it kills me.

06:27.555 --> 06:29.921
Or if it kills anyone else, for that matter.

06:30.057 --> 06:35.552
So you are, it seems,
the most senior senator left in Rome.

06:35.688 --> 06:37.269
l have that honour.

06:37.398 --> 06:41.061
And a turnabout Pompeian to boot.

06:42.111 --> 06:46.525
Which is why I thought it could be amusing

06:46.657 --> 06:49.569
if we made you consul for this year.

06:50.703 --> 06:52.443
Consul?

06:52.580 --> 06:56.323
— That's most kind...
— Allow me to finish speaking.

06:57.585 --> 07:01.794
When the Senate next meets,
there are a couple of legislative items

07:01.922 --> 07:04.299
| wish to see enacted immediately.

07:04.425 --> 07:07.167
I'm sure you will be happy to assist.

07:07.845 --> 07:09.301
ltem one...

07:09.430 --> 07:15.050
The Senate will ratify Caesar's election
as your co-consul for the coming year.

07:16.895 --> 07:18.601
But he is dictator in any case.

07:19.690 --> 07:22.978
It sounds so much better if he is consul.
It's more amicable.

07:24.194 --> 07:25.980
— You got that?
- I do.

07:26.113 --> 07:30.106
-lhave.
— ltem two. You will propose the following law.

07:31.952 --> 07:37.117
"Forthwith, in every province of Italy,
one third of all those employed

07:37.249 --> 07:42.664
"at labouring with cattle or in agriculture
must be freedmen or citizens."

07:42.796 --> 07:44.582
I don't understand.

07:44.715 --> 07:47.673
Too many slaves, you see?
They've taken all the work.

07:47.801 --> 07:51.168
Which causes unemployment
amongst the free populace.

07:51.305 --> 07:54.342
We need to create more jobs for our citizens.

07:54.475 --> 07:56.636
It will be hugely expensive!

07:57.311 --> 08:02.476
It will. But only to those few rich men
who own all the land

08:02.608 --> 08:07.147
and they shall have the consolation of
having done something eminently patriotic.

08:07.279 --> 08:12.239
It seems rather extreme, to say the least.

08:12.368 --> 08:15.201
— Ruinous even.
— You may well be right.

08:15.329 --> 08:21.040
Frankly I do not care whether it is the rich,
poor, or indeed both that suffer.

08:21.168 --> 08:25.707
Caesar wishes this law to be made.
He is my friend, I will have it made.

08:25.839 --> 08:28.216
If you prefer, I could bypass the Senate,

08:28.342 --> 08:32.210
call an assembly of the people
and you can put your arguments to them.

08:32.346 --> 08:37.557
A fine orator like yourself might just
persuade them that Caesar is wrong.

08:38.185 --> 08:40.676
— That won't be necessary.
— Good.

08:40.813 --> 08:45.352
Good. That's it, then.

08:46.694 --> 08:51.028
- I don't know what to say.
— Say nothing, then. It's often best.

08:52.199 --> 08:57.239
You know Posca, of course,
Caesar's creature? He'll take all the details.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.622
Poppaea...

09:02.626 --> 09:05.868
my dove, if your husband should die...

09:07.506 --> 09:09.747
come to me, we'll marry?

09:25.774 --> 09:29.983
— So, keeping their promises, isn't he?
— What?

09:30.112 --> 09:33.604
Caesar and Mark Antony,
doing right by the people.

09:33.741 --> 09:37.609
That was your worry? That Caesar'd
turn out to be another tyrant sort?

09:37.745 --> 09:41.408
But here's him and Mark Antony
getting jobs for the unemployed.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.781
You can't complain about that, now, can you?

09:43.917 --> 09:46.454
He negotiates with a whore
and a dwarf at his side.

09:46.587 --> 09:50.671
Would Cincinnatus or Marius or even
the Gracchi would demean themselves so?

09:50.799 --> 09:53.176
Who?

09:53.302 --> 09:56.590
Mark Antony has his odd ways,
there's no denying that.

10:03.979 --> 10:05.970
I'm not going home. I need a drink.

10:06.106 --> 10:09.815
- Drink? You?
— |, drink, what of it?

10:09.943 --> 10:12.320
I'll not argue.

10:15.616 --> 10:16.822
Sorry.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.908
- You need to calm down.
— How can I be calm? Two months.

10:20.037 --> 10:23.325
— Aren't you done yet?
— Will you sit still?

10:24.958 --> 10:28.166
Won't catch a pretty new husband
with a sour face like that.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.502
I don't want a new husband. I want Crito.

10:30.631 --> 10:34.840
You can't stay married to a drover,
not now that your father's a prefect.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.380
— It wouldn't be right. Too low.
- I told her.

10:37.513 --> 10:39.504
Fortunately you haven't paid out dowry.

10:39.640 --> 10:44.976
— We'll find someone nice, proper status.
- I don't want anyone!

10:45.103 --> 10:47.845
You can't be unmarried. It wouldn't be decent.

10:47.981 --> 10:51.473
— Decent, she says.
— What's that supposed to mean?

10:51.610 --> 10:54.192
You know what it means.

10:54.321 --> 10:58.985
- You hold your tongue.
— Or what? What will you do?

11:04.122 --> 11:06.955
It's all right, sweetie. It's all right.

11:10.337 --> 11:13.670
I thought it was going well for a while but now...

11:18.512 --> 11:20.969
Maybe I should beat her, do you think?

11:21.849 --> 11:26.058
I don't know. That only works if you keep at it.

11:26.186 --> 11:29.394
A good thrashing once or twice a day
till they're docile.

11:29.523 --> 11:31.889
But then they don't look so good.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.892
It would be a shame
to mark up a beauty like her.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.113
She is?

11:42.953 --> 11:46.821
— She's a beauty.
- She is that.

11:46.957 --> 11:50.449
Slaves, money, everything. What do | get?
Nothing, that's what.

11:50.586 --> 11:53.168
| get a house full of wailing.

11:53.297 --> 11:55.959
My wife won't even couple with me.

11:57.885 --> 12:01.594
— Why not?
— Says she can't while her sister stays.

12:01.722 --> 12:05.465
What's her sister to do with it?
What difference should that make?

12:15.652 --> 12:19.861
What is wrong with her?
What is wrong with her?

12:19.990 --> 12:23.528
What is wrong with me
that I'm served this way?

12:24.578 --> 12:28.241
You should leave her maybe,
seeing as she makes you so unhappy.

12:28.373 --> 12:31.115
No! lwill not leave her.

12:36.632 --> 12:39.089
I'd rather die than leave her.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.097
It's all right, lamb.

12:55.233 --> 12:57.269
It'll be all right.

13:04.952 --> 13:09.821
Who, I say, faced with the ovenNhelming force

13:09.957 --> 13:12.824
of the figures and the arguments
l have here marshalled

13:12.960 --> 13:16.828
could resist their ovenNhelming conclusion?

13:16.964 --> 13:23.756
Therefore I ask you,
honoured conscript fathers,

13:23.887 --> 13:26.924
to support me in this important and...

13:28.392 --> 13:31.884
..patriotic legislation which will...

13:36.692 --> 13:40.981
Does anyone wish
to speak against the motion?

13:46.118 --> 13:49.986
No opposition voiced. No division required.

13:50.122 --> 13:51.828
Motion carried.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.624
Empty.

14:05.303 --> 14:08.010
If there's no wine, water will do.

14:18.316 --> 14:20.602
Thank you, my dove.

14:22.863 --> 14:27.823
So, Lyde, l was asking around, you know,
about your man there, Evander.

14:27.951 --> 14:32.160
- Asking around?
— See if I could find out anything for you.

14:32.289 --> 14:34.655
Only I know a few shady characters, see?

14:34.791 --> 14:38.375
Types that might know what's what
when a man's gone missing.

14:39.838 --> 14:45.049
Any road, they tell me
that he got himself into some trouble

14:45.177 --> 14:47.839
with some nasty Greek boys across the river.

14:47.971 --> 14:52.715
- Gambling debts, they say.
— Gambling? Evander never gambled.

14:52.851 --> 14:57.311
Well, sure, it's the sort of thing a man
keeps quiet around his wife, isn't it?

14:59.900 --> 15:01.891
What are you saying?

15:02.027 --> 15:05.110
I'm sorry to say it
but it looks like he's not coming home.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.025
Dead, looks like.

15:08.158 --> 15:09.944
Are you sure?

15:11.411 --> 15:14.744
So they tell me. Dead. Killed.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.447
It isn't true.

15:19.836 --> 15:25.797
My advice, best forget about him.
Best get on with your life.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.917
It isn't true.

15:28.053 --> 15:31.716
It's not so bad.
You've still got people that love you.

15:31.848 --> 15:33.804
Look to them...

15:33.934 --> 15:38.177
Isn't that right, Niobe?
Best she gets on with her life.

15:38.313 --> 15:40.770
Best she looks to the people that love her.

15:44.736 --> 15:48.820
Forget Evander. Forget the past.

15:53.829 --> 15:55.820
Well, I'm away.

15:55.956 --> 15:58.288
Need a drop of wine to set me up for the day.

16:16.935 --> 16:19.551
Lyde, please don't.

16:23.150 --> 16:27.143
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

16:27.737 --> 16:31.025
You're sorry? It's too late for sorry, isn't it?

16:31.158 --> 16:35.697
You weren't sorry when you were fucking him!
I piss on your sorrow!

16:35.829 --> 16:37.785
I will not shh. You shh!

16:37.914 --> 16:40.656
You're a thief and a whore
and you stole my husband!

16:40.792 --> 16:42.999
I stole nothing! He came to me!

16:43.128 --> 16:45.744
He came to me!
I never loved him. I love my husband!

16:45.881 --> 16:48.338
And if you'd done...if you'd been...

16:49.509 --> 16:51.591
If I had done what?

16:52.929 --> 16:55.966
If I had given him a child. Is that it?

16:56.099 --> 16:59.091
I am sorry. Please forgive me. Forgive me!

16:59.227 --> 17:05.689
l curse you, sister.
By the grace of the Furies, l curse you.

17:09.571 --> 17:14.736
I'll keep your secret for the sake of the child

17:14.868 --> 17:19.578
but don't you ever, ever speak to me again.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.562
Be careful!

18:01.081 --> 18:05.996
Bravo. Bravo.
A little blood lust suits you, Octavian.

18:06.127 --> 18:07.958
You look very handsome. Does he not?

18:08.088 --> 18:10.750
— He does.
— Titus Pullo is a good teacher.

18:10.882 --> 18:16.047
Well, it's a pity Caesar isn't here.
He'd put you on his staff immediately.

18:16.179 --> 18:21.014
Perhaps you should join him in Greece,
get real Pompeian blood on your sword.

18:21.142 --> 18:23.053
— Don't be silly, Mother.
- Why not?

18:23.186 --> 18:25.928
If we are not quick,
Pompey, Cato and all those fools

18:26.064 --> 18:29.056
will be dead before Octavian
gets his chance to shine.

18:29.192 --> 18:30.773
— He's still a child.
- I am not.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.733
He is quite the little man now.

18:32.862 --> 18:36.650
I should think there's more
to manhood than swordplay.

18:36.783 --> 18:40.992
— Octavian, have you penetrated anyone yet?
- Mother, please.

18:41.121 --> 18:43.988
— Does that mean you have or haven't?
- Haven't...

18:44.124 --> 18:48.493
Titus Pullo, didn't I tell you
to sort that out? I'm sure I did.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.586
Sorry, ma'am. I'll see to it.

18:51.715 --> 18:56.175
Do that. Don't worry, darling.
There's really nothing to it.

18:56.303 --> 18:59.921
Once you're in the saddle, as it were,
it'll all come naturally.

19:00.056 --> 19:02.342
— Isn't that right, Pullo?
— Right, ma'am.

19:02.475 --> 19:06.388
And none of your sordid
soldiers' she—wolves, mind you.

19:06.521 --> 19:08.182
Something clean and pretty.

19:08.315 --> 19:10.852
— Clean and pretty it is.
- Good.

19:10.984 --> 19:13.976
I'll get Merula to make you a toga. What else?

19:14.112 --> 19:17.195
Perhaps you can arrange he kill someone.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.360
That will happen in due course.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.983
We Julii always have the needful enemies.

19:35.216 --> 19:37.298
Health to my child.

19:38.928 --> 19:41.544
My daughter.

19:41.681 --> 19:44.138
| wish for a son, a healthy son.

20:12.629 --> 20:15.041
Good night, then.

20:18.343 --> 20:20.584
Good night.

20:48.581 --> 20:51.288
- Husband.
— What's all this?

20:53.128 --> 20:56.746
I thought it might please you
if we had some time alone together.

20:59.092 --> 21:01.879
I sent the girls and Lucius to Clarissa.

21:05.265 --> 21:08.177
— And Lyde?
— She's gone to a friend's.

21:10.645 --> 21:13.307
— Please, sit down.
— I've already eaten.

21:16.109 --> 21:19.067
But I can have some more.

21:25.243 --> 21:27.199
Excuse me.

21:55.064 --> 21:57.146
Sit down with me.

21:57.984 --> 22:02.853
— That's all right.
— Really, sit. I can't finish all this on my own.

22:49.869 --> 22:52.155
The calendar is correct...

22:55.208 --> 22:57.870
if you would like to have me tonight.

23:01.005 --> 23:03.087
I would.

23:04.551 --> 23:06.963
I'd like that.

24:59.624 --> 25:01.410
"My dear Mark Antony,

25:05.171 --> 25:07.833
"I chased Pompey
from one end of Greece to the other

25:07.965 --> 25:10.547
"and he resolutely refused to fight.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.793
"I thought this was his usual obtuseness

25:12.929 --> 25:17.218
"but the old man has
some sense left in him yet.

25:20.436 --> 25:24.679
"While avoiding battle, he has gathered
a good ten legions from the east

25:24.816 --> 25:27.102
"and | find myself badly outnumbered.

25:33.491 --> 25:37.530
"Now the cat barks at the dog
and Pompey is chasing me.

25:46.170 --> 25:50.379
"I can outmanoeuvre him for a while
but not for ever.

25:53.386 --> 25:58.130
"My men are tired and ill—supplied
and we shall soon have to stand and fight.

25:58.266 --> 26:03.306
"| ask you to bring the 13th here
as speedily as you are able."

26:17.368 --> 26:19.279
Damnation.

26:19.412 --> 26:21.824
Shall I summon the legion legates?

26:24.292 --> 26:26.874
No. Wait.

26:27.003 --> 26:29.085
I must think on this.

26:31.758 --> 26:34.170
This is lovely.

26:36.387 --> 26:37.763
It's just your colouring.

26:37.889 --> 26:43.054
— A little loud. I'd prefer something plainer.
— What's the point in plain? We shall take it.

26:45.188 --> 26:46.928
But this one...

26:52.278 --> 26:54.985
Divine. Oh, divine.

26:55.114 --> 26:58.698
Antony will love this.
He likes me in Eastern styles.

26:58.826 --> 27:01.659
— How much for both?
— 5,000.

27:01.788 --> 27:04.575
- You are a thief.
— Four and a half, then.

27:04.707 --> 27:06.618
Three.

27:07.627 --> 27:09.993
Can we afford such expense?

27:10.129 --> 27:13.997
Things as they are with Caesar in Greece,
surely we should be more prudent?

27:14.133 --> 27:17.876
Don't worry about a thing, my dear,
I'm thinking ahead.

27:18.930 --> 27:20.966
Titus Pullo is here, dominus.

27:23.976 --> 27:28.219
Tell him lam unwell.
He may come back next week, perhaps.

27:28.356 --> 27:32.725
Tell him nothing of the sort. Octavian
will be ready to see him in one moment.

27:32.860 --> 27:35.351
And give him a purse.

27:35.488 --> 27:38.230
— You've put off this moment long enough.
- Mother...

27:38.366 --> 27:43.406
You will penetrate someone today
or I will burn your wretched books in the yard.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.116
Off with you.

27:58.094 --> 28:01.382
Coming through.
Noble coming through. Make way there.

28:13.442 --> 28:16.934
Don't worry, young master.
There's nothing to it.

28:17.071 --> 28:21.735
If there is nothing to it,
why is such a fuss made of the thing?

28:21.868 --> 28:23.950
You'll soon find out.

28:33.963 --> 28:37.626
Be off with you! This isn't
no infantry fuck hole, thank you very much.

28:37.758 --> 28:39.749
Now, now, my honey, calm your stomach.

28:39.886 --> 28:41.968
We've come for the young master here.

28:42.096 --> 28:44.428
And we're well coined.

28:44.557 --> 28:49.597
Well, excuse me, of course.
I meant no disrespect.

28:49.729 --> 28:52.436
We're honoured to service you, young master.

28:52.565 --> 28:55.898
And what would be
the young master's pleasure?

28:59.405 --> 29:01.737
First timer. Nothing too savoury.

29:03.117 --> 29:05.733
I'm sure we have just the thing.

29:14.420 --> 29:17.787
Something exotic, perhaps?

29:20.259 --> 29:22.295
Or else something young?

29:22.428 --> 29:24.919
Light, simple.

29:26.140 --> 29:30.099
Little bit skinny, isn't it?
Won't know he's been, will he?

29:31.145 --> 29:32.976
Won't know you've been!

29:34.440 --> 29:40.936
More substance, yet still nymphlike, graceful.

29:44.075 --> 29:46.691
This one's fresh off the boat...

29:46.827 --> 29:51.287
- That will be fine.
— Hold on, young master. No point hurrying.

29:51.415 --> 29:53.326
Big decision, this.

29:53.459 --> 29:56.371
- Let's look at...
— This one is perfectly adequate.

29:56.504 --> 29:59.587
You will be utterly satisfied, I assure you.

29:59.715 --> 30:03.333
Egeria, go prepare yourself.

30:03.469 --> 30:06.802
If we might dispense
with the pecuniary details...

30:09.141 --> 30:10.677
Right.

30:10.810 --> 30:13.472
— What's your price, then?
- 1,000.

30:14.146 --> 30:18.515
I could have half the whores
in Narbo for that, and their mothers.

30:18.651 --> 30:21.358
We're not in Narbo, wherever that might be.

30:22.279 --> 30:25.567
All right, my dove. We'll pay.

30:27.034 --> 30:30.322
But she better fuck him
like Helen of Troy with her arse on fire,

30:30.454 --> 30:32.445
or I'll know the reason why.

30:44.844 --> 30:48.712
- Speak.
— Gnaeus Pompey Magnus sends greetings.

30:48.848 --> 30:50.964
He hopes you find his house satisfactory.

30:52.268 --> 30:54.304
It'll do.

30:55.229 --> 30:57.345
— Get to his point.
- His point?

30:58.065 --> 31:00.442
Caesar is doomed and you with him.

31:00.568 --> 31:03.355
— Unless you make a separate peace.
— And?

31:06.032 --> 31:08.990
If you do,
Pompey will be merciful and generous.

31:09.118 --> 31:10.483
How?

31:10.619 --> 31:12.996
He will give you your life. A province.

31:13.122 --> 31:15.864
Money enough to preserve your dignity.

31:17.043 --> 31:20.456
What makes him think I value my life so high?

31:21.881 --> 31:24.543
Why have you not left for Greece?

31:24.675 --> 31:27.132
Do not smile at me.

31:29.388 --> 31:32.300
Return tomorrow.
I will give Pompey his answer then.

31:35.978 --> 31:38.060
Not that way.

31:43.611 --> 31:45.727
And disguise yourself.

32:02.296 --> 32:03.706
Dismissed.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.683
You take clothes down?

32:19.563 --> 32:21.849
That's an interesting accent.

32:24.151 --> 32:26.233
No understand.

32:29.824 --> 32:33.408
Where are you from?

32:35.746 --> 32:37.782
Where from.

32:37.915 --> 32:39.325
Don't know.

32:39.458 --> 32:42.120
You don't know where you're from?

32:46.048 --> 32:48.164
Rome take me very young.

32:49.301 --> 32:55.012
Kill mother, father, brother, take me.

32:57.643 --> 32:59.099
lsee.Sad.

33:18.914 --> 33:20.996
Turn over, would you?

33:25.337 --> 33:27.828
On your hands and knees.

33:43.814 --> 33:46.681
Nice place, this. Clean.

33:52.198 --> 33:56.407
I don't suppose,
seeing as I'm with the quality...

33:56.535 --> 33:58.696
Not a chance.

34:06.378 --> 34:09.370
No, do it for real. Fight.

34:14.303 --> 34:16.919
Come on, fight, damn you! Fight!

34:17.056 --> 34:18.796
That's better!

34:18.933 --> 34:21.345
Good.

34:31.695 --> 34:36.234
Now, there! Don't be so silly,
it's just a scratch, now.

34:40.913 --> 34:43.279
There, there.

34:43.415 --> 34:44.951
Yes, Posca, what is it?

34:45.084 --> 34:49.919
I am to remind you of
your dinner tonight with Atia of the Julii.

34:50.923 --> 34:53.665
Sons of Dis.

34:53.801 --> 34:55.757
Now run along.

34:59.556 --> 35:02.138
Where is he? Where can he be?

35:02.268 --> 35:03.804
Busy man. Politics.

35:03.936 --> 35:07.269
Politics? He promised he would come. Castor!

35:08.816 --> 35:13.059
Send a man to Pompey's... I mean, Mark
Antony's villa and enquire his whereabouts.

35:13.195 --> 35:17.859
— Antony's whereabouts, immediately.
— Do not say it is I who sends to ask.

35:17.992 --> 35:19.823
Not you sends to ask.

35:19.952 --> 35:24.662
Stay. He'll know it is I who asked.
Send no one.

35:24.790 --> 35:29.204
— I will send no one.
— If he comes, he comes, I don't care!

35:49.898 --> 35:51.980
Men, halt!

35:53.319 --> 35:55.435
Welcome, dominus.

36:24.183 --> 36:27.516
Sorry to be so horribly late. Endless business.

36:29.229 --> 36:31.436
— Will you forgive me?
— Of course.

36:31.565 --> 36:36.184
I confess, l'd quite forgotten you were coming.
So this is a lovely surprise.

36:36.320 --> 36:39.608
Excuse me a moment,
I will go and dress correctly.

37:28.747 --> 37:31.705
Here he is, young Apollo!

37:31.834 --> 37:34.951
- How was it?
— It was pleasant.

37:35.087 --> 37:37.999
Pleasant? I should say so.

37:39.091 --> 37:42.083
— How was he?
— Like bu||.

38:09.997 --> 38:12.283
— What's wrong?
- Nothing.

38:15.419 --> 38:17.501
Tell me.

38:23.552 --> 38:27.136
Mark Antony does not intend
to go to Greece to help Caesar.

38:28.807 --> 38:32.095
l have sworn loyalty to a man of no honour.

38:33.520 --> 38:36.512
Well, you don't have to go to Greece, then.

38:36.648 --> 38:39.936
— We'll be together.
— It's true, but still.

38:41.278 --> 38:44.315
Haven't you always said
Caesar's cause is wrong?

38:45.657 --> 38:47.613
That is not the point.

38:47.743 --> 38:50.200
There is a moral principle involved.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.916
What an idiot you are.

39:12.476 --> 39:14.888
Not hungry?

39:15.020 --> 39:18.353
After so many years
of soldier's porridge, I am easily sated.

39:19.441 --> 39:23.309
Well, this last news from Greece
cannot have improved your appetite.

39:23.445 --> 39:25.060
Hardly.

39:25.197 --> 39:28.906
And is it really so bad?
Caesar always finds a way to win.

39:29.034 --> 39:33.027
Pompey has gathered ten men
for every one of Caesar's.

39:33.163 --> 39:37.202
— Arithmetic has no mercy.
- l'd feared it was so.

39:39.044 --> 39:41.285
What do you intend to do, then?

39:50.055 --> 39:52.387
I don't know.

39:54.768 --> 39:59.558
You've become a powerful man.
The people love you.

39:59.690 --> 40:01.021
Only because they don't know me.

40:01.149 --> 40:04.641
You could be the first man
in Rome, if you wanted.

40:04.778 --> 40:06.939
I hadn't thought about it like that.

40:08.031 --> 40:10.113
Well, you should.

40:11.076 --> 40:13.362
You should think about that.

40:14.955 --> 40:18.948
I'm thinking about something entirely different.

40:47.404 --> 40:49.486
Water.

41:12.137 --> 41:14.173
I could sleep for a week.

41:21.688 --> 41:24.145
I've been thinking.

41:27.986 --> 41:30.318
We should get married.

41:33.200 --> 41:35.236
Married?

41:36.703 --> 41:38.910
Why should we want to do that of all things?

41:40.874 --> 41:45.163
— Perhaps I love you.
- You're joking.

41:46.004 --> 41:48.916
For a moment there, you had me worried.

41:49.049 --> 41:51.381
I am notjoking with you.

41:53.220 --> 41:57.259
— My dear woman.
— Don't worry, I'm not going soft on you.

41:58.058 --> 42:00.720
I'm thinking strategically.

42:01.561 --> 42:06.851
lf Caesar is defeated, I can't very well
form an alliance with the Pompeians.

42:08.193 --> 42:10.855
— I need protection.
- True.

42:13.699 --> 42:15.530
And what's in it for me?

42:17.119 --> 42:20.611
— lf Caesar is defeated...
— Then I will be defeated also.

42:20.747 --> 42:23.124
Only if you join him in Greece.

42:23.250 --> 42:27.118
But if you stay in Rome,
you will be very well situated.

42:27.254 --> 42:31.463
You have the people with you,
you have possession of the city.

42:31.591 --> 42:35.675
You only lack money.
And whilst your name is perfectly respectable...

42:35.804 --> 42:38.420
— I am no patrician.
— Exactly.

42:38.557 --> 42:41.594
But allied with my house,
you'd have both coin and nobility

42:41.727 --> 42:43.934
to make yourself king if you wished it so.

42:44.062 --> 42:46.223
And you would be queen.

42:46.356 --> 42:49.644
I would be your loving and obedient wife.

42:51.111 --> 42:53.773
Only if I were willing to desert a friend.

42:53.905 --> 42:55.941
A man of your own blood.

42:59.411 --> 43:03.575
But I don't think you'll die
for the sake of appearances.

43:06.626 --> 43:10.289
- Will I not?
— Caesar will die in any case.

43:10.422 --> 43:14.586
But you're far too clever
to share his fate needlessly.

43:20.432 --> 43:22.844
I had not realised until now...

43:24.269 --> 43:28.228
what a wicked old harpy you really are.

43:41.995 --> 43:44.077
Get out!

43:45.332 --> 43:47.288
Get out!

44:04.726 --> 44:07.012
Thank you, Pullo.

44:08.814 --> 44:11.556
Attention!

45:06.746 --> 45:08.737
Abed in daylight, what luxury.

45:08.874 --> 45:11.411
Wickedness.

45:11.543 --> 45:14.831
Father, that dwarf is asking for you!

45:17.507 --> 45:21.716
Excellency Mark Antony orders 13th Legion
to muster on the Field of Mars.

45:21.845 --> 45:24.507
— Why? Where are we going?
— Greece.

45:55.003 --> 45:56.459
Tnbune!

45:58.506 --> 46:03.250
— What shall I tell Pompey?
- Of course.

46:03.386 --> 46:06.173
Excuse me. I had forgot you.

46:32.791 --> 46:37.660
His skin is a little dry.
Have him well—oiled before he is presented.

46:39.422 --> 46:42.380
— I'm afraid to ask.
— Gifts for Servilia.

46:47.138 --> 46:49.880
How fine you look. Let me see.

46:51.476 --> 46:55.139
I'm so proud of you.
You're a real man at last...

46:55.271 --> 46:57.136
Why are we giving gifts to Servilia?

46:57.273 --> 47:00.140
The old crow stands in
well with Cato and the rest.

47:00.276 --> 47:03.484
— When Caesar and Antony are defeated...
— If they are defeated.

47:03.613 --> 47:06.946
When they are defeated,
we'll need her goodwill.

47:07.075 --> 47:09.441
- And this will buy it?
— I don't see why not.

47:09.577 --> 47:12.319
A large penis is always welcome.

47:12.455 --> 47:14.867
— Is it not enough?
— After what you did to her?

47:15.000 --> 47:18.367
— What I did? What did I do to her?
— Please! I'm not stupid.

47:18.503 --> 47:20.494
It was you made Caesar renounce her.

47:20.630 --> 47:23.372
— What if I did? She doesn't know it.
— Does she not?

47:23.508 --> 47:26.875
— She's not stupid either.
— Servilia has no guile in her.

47:27.012 --> 47:29.378
If she knows it, we would have heard about it.

47:29.514 --> 47:31.254
You know best, I'm sure.

47:31.391 --> 47:36.385
In any case, you will take the gifts to her
and see what she's thinking.

47:37.105 --> 47:39.517
She's always been very fond of you.

47:40.567 --> 47:42.558
And you will go to Mediolanum.

47:42.694 --> 47:44.605
— Timon will take you.
- Mediolanum?

47:44.738 --> 47:46.603
They have a very good academy there.

47:46.740 --> 47:49.322
— I don't understand.
— You're a man now.

47:49.451 --> 47:52.033
Rome's not safe for men of the Julii.

47:54.831 --> 47:59.495
His toenails are ugly. Have them cut
and painted and put flowers on his head.

47:59.627 --> 48:01.834
And send over some ice. Six barrels, say.

48:01.963 --> 48:04.045
Six barrels of ice.

48:08.678 --> 48:12.796
Don't look so foolish.
I know what I'm about.

48:22.233 --> 48:24.349
Your mother's too kind.

48:27.280 --> 48:30.067
To what do I owe this generosity?

48:30.200 --> 48:32.407
It's a gesture of friendship.

48:34.037 --> 48:36.119
Friendship.

48:36.247 --> 48:39.455
Thank your mother for her...friendship.

48:39.584 --> 48:44.669
I hope one day to reciprocate her...friendship.

48:48.968 --> 48:51.095
lwill go, then.

48:54.474 --> 48:55.554
Excuse me.

48:57.060 --> 48:58.721
Wait.

49:00.188 --> 49:02.395
Please, forgive my ill humour.

49:03.858 --> 49:06.349
There's nothing to forgive.

49:06.486 --> 49:09.774
I've known you since you were little.
You have a good soul.

49:11.366 --> 49:16.736
I know that, whatever others might do,
you are blameless.

49:16.871 --> 49:18.827
I know that.

49:18.957 --> 49:21.573
I do not... That is, I cannot...

49:23.128 --> 49:26.291
It's all right. There's no need.

49:30.844 --> 49:35.338
Tell your mother that I am grateful for the gifts

49:35.473 --> 49:39.182
and that l treasure her friendship as always.

49:44.649 --> 49:48.141
You must come and visit me again. Will you?

49:48.278 --> 49:50.894
— I will.
— Promise?

49:51.948 --> 49:54.690
I want there to be no ill feeling between us.

49:54.826 --> 49:56.316
I promise.

50:08.715 --> 50:10.797
You be a good girl.

50:11.968 --> 50:14.004
Do as you're told.

50:22.353 --> 50:24.344
I'll wait for you outside.

50:50.381 --> 50:52.417
Bellona protect you.

50:54.219 --> 50:56.335
And Juno keep you.

52:31.441 --> 52:34.649
A fleet of ships has set sail for Greece,

52:34.777 --> 52:38.486
carrying the army of General Mark Antony.

52:39.532 --> 52:45.027
This month's public bread is provided
by the Capitoline Brotherhood of Millers.

52:45.163 --> 52:48.530
The Brotherhood uses only the finest flour,

52:48.666 --> 52:52.500
true Roman bread for true Romans.

53:11.022 --> 53:13.479
This is cack, this is! I'm wet through!

53:13.608 --> 53:17.567
We're perfectly safe.
A very good offering was made to Triton!

53:17.695 --> 53:20.858
lf Triton can't keep me drier than this,
he can suck my cock!

53:23.409 --> 53:26.492
Why can't you learn
to keep your fat mouth shut?
