NARRATOR: Previously
on Dance Academy.

00:05.360 --> 00:07.519
-Come and work as
my assistant.

00:07.559 --> 00:11.199
-He says he's withdrawing
his financial support.

00:11.240 --> 00:12.800
-Do you remember in the
interview when you promised

00:12.839 --> 00:13.439
coordination?

00:13.480 --> 00:14.919
-Samuel.

00:14.960 --> 00:17.399
I do hope those outside work
commitments aren't continuing

00:17.440 --> 00:18.519
now that term is resumed?

00:18.559 --> 00:20.160
-Who's got time on the
Academy schedule.

00:20.199 --> 00:22.719
-Um, excuse me, are
you Saskia Duncan?

00:22.760 --> 00:24.039
-I hope so.

00:24.079 --> 00:25.079
-I saw you in the Firebird.

00:25.120 --> 00:26.199
You were amazing.

00:26.239 --> 00:28.120
-You should come tonight
as well.

00:28.160 --> 00:30.640
Watch us on stage?

00:30.679 --> 00:31.839
-Take some big breaths.

00:31.879 --> 00:32.840
Come on.

00:32.880 --> 00:34.439
You'll be all right.

00:34.479 --> 00:36.439
[theme music]

00:47.840 --> 00:51.399
THEME SONG: Take a breath.

00:51.439 --> 00:54.399
Close your eyes.

00:54.439 --> 00:59.359
Take a leap of faith and
lead the way tonight.

01:02.799 --> 01:04.760
This is my chance!

01:04.799 --> 01:06.760
This is my chance!

01:06.799 --> 01:09.319
My chance to feel alive.

01:22.359 --> 01:24.799
NARRATOR: I used to have posters
of my favorite dancers

01:24.840 --> 01:27.200
all over my bedroom walls.

01:27.239 --> 01:29.359
I'd study them for hours.

01:29.400 --> 01:31.200
I thought I knew them.

01:31.239 --> 01:34.519
Like they were my friends,
only more perfect.

01:34.560 --> 01:36.840
Then I came to the Academy
and met some of my

01:36.879 --> 01:39.159
idols in real life.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.640
It's only up close that you
realize they're just people.

01:45.400 --> 01:49.079
Which isn't so bad either,
because if they're human,

01:49.120 --> 01:51.319
there's the slightest chance
that you might grow up to be

01:51.359 --> 01:52.560
on a poster too.

02:01.560 --> 02:04.400
-Second year.

02:04.439 --> 02:08.199
I'd like you to welcome
Saskia Duncan.

02:08.240 --> 02:10.560
I'm sure most of you know her
by reputation as being the

02:10.598 --> 02:13.439
company's youngest ever
principal dancer.

02:13.479 --> 02:14.919
-Hi guys.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.599
Saskia's recovering from an
injury, but over the next few

02:17.639 --> 02:21.199
months has agreed to take you
for repertoire class.

02:21.240 --> 02:22.840
-Calm down, training bra.

02:22.879 --> 02:24.360
-I'll leave you in her
very capable hands.

02:24.400 --> 02:27.159
-Thank you.

02:27.199 --> 02:28.719
OK, guys.

02:28.759 --> 02:32.280
You should know for your own
safety, I haven't done this

02:32.319 --> 02:35.199
before, so yeah.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.080
flying by the seat
of my pants.

02:37.120 --> 02:38.719
-Did you get that subtext?

02:38.759 --> 02:40.439
I'm not just your teacher.

02:40.479 --> 02:42.159
I'm also your friend.

02:42.199 --> 02:43.840
-I don't care who she
is, as long as she

02:43.879 --> 02:46.400
prefers me to Tara.

02:46.439 --> 02:49.479
Would you like to be called
Saskia or Ms. Duncan, Miss?

02:49.520 --> 02:51.120
-Saskia's fine.

02:51.159 --> 02:53.840
-Um, on behalf of everyone, I'd
just like to say how great

02:53.879 --> 02:55.439
it is that you're teaching us.

02:55.479 --> 02:56.639
-Oh, thank you.

02:56.680 --> 02:57.360
-Sycophant.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.599
-Hypocrite.

02:59.639 --> 03:01.599
[music playing]

03:15.400 --> 03:16.599
-And stop there, please.

03:19.080 --> 03:20.520
-Well, I reckon that
was much better.

03:20.560 --> 03:23.439
But you know, I was thinking,
that lift would be much more

03:23.479 --> 03:26.560
dynamic if we segue it into
the floor sequence.

03:26.599 --> 03:29.080
-When you have choreographed
more of your own work, you can

03:29.120 --> 03:30.319
interrupt rehearsals.

03:35.159 --> 03:39.120
I was about to say, there is
a type of applause that I

03:39.159 --> 03:40.479
particularly dislike.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.599
The applause that when, for just
a moment, the audience

03:42.639 --> 03:44.800
realizes that the dancers are
doing something that they

03:44.840 --> 03:46.439
actually understand.

03:46.479 --> 03:52.599
Like oh look, he's
riding a bicycle.

03:52.639 --> 03:54.400
Bravo.

03:54.439 --> 03:59.120
I resent that applause because
it means that the rest of the

03:59.159 --> 04:01.759
work lacks clarity and intent.

04:01.800 --> 04:07.159
My choreography has clarity and
intent, but as yet, the

04:07.199 --> 04:09.199
execution does not.

04:09.240 --> 04:11.639
So think about what we're trying
to convey and then

04:11.680 --> 04:14.520
please commit to it.

04:14.560 --> 04:17.079
Once again, from the lift.

04:17.120 --> 04:19.720
-If you have something to
contribute, I'd prefer you

04:19.759 --> 04:20.639
approach me privately first.

04:20.680 --> 04:21.680
-Why?

04:21.720 --> 04:22.319
You're not interested
in anything I

04:22.360 --> 04:23.199
have to say, anyway.

04:23.240 --> 04:24.399
-OK.

04:24.439 --> 04:26.199
Five, six, seven, eight.

04:26.240 --> 04:28.279
-$16?

04:28.319 --> 04:33.399
How is it even possible
to just have $16?

04:33.439 --> 04:35.439
And like even if I want to
withdraw it, it's too small

04:35.480 --> 04:38.439
amount for the ATM
to process, so--

04:38.480 --> 04:39.800
-Katrina?

04:39.839 --> 04:41.680
I didn't realize you were
still enrolled.

04:41.720 --> 04:42.879
-Oh, no, no.

04:42.920 --> 04:44.600
It's-- it's the superior cuisine
here, Ms. Raine.

04:44.639 --> 04:48.199
It's just such a hard
habit to break.

04:48.240 --> 04:51.360
-Mr. Lieberman, I was speaking
to the bursar about the status

04:51.399 --> 04:52.199
of your tuition fees.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.680
They're conspicuously absent.

04:53.720 --> 04:54.319
-No, I know.

04:54.360 --> 04:55.319
I know.

04:55.360 --> 04:57.120
I rang Papa Lieberman
last night.

04:57.160 --> 04:57.560
My gramp.

04:57.600 --> 04:58.360
You know?

04:58.399 --> 05:00.240
Bubba, the money.

05:00.279 --> 05:02.120
They're waiting.

05:02.160 --> 05:03.199
And yeah.

05:03.240 --> 05:04.600
Definitely happening.

05:04.639 --> 05:06.639
-Tomorrow then.

05:06.680 --> 05:08.600
-It's like a web of lies.

05:08.639 --> 05:10.839
-I know.

05:10.879 --> 05:12.319
-Saskia, hi.

05:12.360 --> 05:14.639
Can I get you a coffee?

05:14.680 --> 05:15.240
-Yeah, sure.

05:15.279 --> 05:18.800
-Uh, Kat.

05:18.839 --> 05:20.079
Oh, Saskia, hi.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.160
Do you need anything?

05:21.199 --> 05:22.480
-I already got her a latte.

05:22.519 --> 05:23.800
-Why don't you both sit down?

05:28.839 --> 05:31.199
-So, um, how are you?

05:31.240 --> 05:33.480
What happened was so awful.

05:33.519 --> 05:36.600
-Saskia probably doesn't want
to talk about that, Tara.

05:36.639 --> 05:39.519
How about you talk to me
about repertoire class?

05:39.560 --> 05:40.360
Any tips?

05:40.399 --> 05:42.720
Things you wanna see improved?

05:42.759 --> 05:46.439
-I was chatting over lunch
with Tara and Andrea--

05:46.480 --> 05:47.920
-Abigail.

05:47.959 --> 05:51.240
-Abigail, about the Prix de
Fonteyn selection process, and

05:51.279 --> 05:53.600
I've decided to let you out of
class for the rest of the day

05:53.639 --> 05:55.680
so you can start thinking
about your solos.

05:55.720 --> 05:56.800
Take it from me.

05:56.839 --> 05:59.360
This competition can
be career defining.

05:59.399 --> 06:01.360
Now, go to the DVD
library, OK?

06:01.399 --> 06:02.839
And be original.

06:02.879 --> 06:05.480
I will throw these crutches at
you if I have to sit through

06:05.519 --> 06:06.920
10 Auroras.

06:06.959 --> 06:08.639
And tomorrow morning, I want to
see what you come up with.

06:15.360 --> 06:17.800
-Just choose one, Abs, and then
we're going to the beach.

06:20.839 --> 06:22.800
-Ugh, do you think you could
bag me something?

06:22.839 --> 06:25.480
Just, for once, I can make
it to work on time.

06:25.519 --> 06:26.680
-Yeah, definitely.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.040
Hey, I'm giving her one
more minute, and then

06:28.079 --> 06:30.800
I'm gonna get this.

06:30.839 --> 06:32.399
Like a lioness protecting
her cubs.

06:37.639 --> 06:39.439
-Bypassing any research?

06:39.480 --> 06:40.519
-I already have an idea.

06:40.560 --> 06:41.720
It's been in my head for ages.

06:47.839 --> 06:50.279
-Victoria.

06:50.319 --> 06:51.720
The Red Shoes.

06:51.759 --> 06:53.759
Also known as the solo Saskia
dance when she represented

06:53.800 --> 06:55.800
Australia at the Prix
de Fonteyn.

06:55.839 --> 06:57.160
Take these.

07:03.319 --> 07:05.399
-And stop there, please.

07:05.439 --> 07:08.839
I don't know why this is still
feeling so underwhelming.

07:08.879 --> 07:11.639
Once more, please.

07:11.680 --> 07:13.639
[music playing]

07:21.199 --> 07:21.680
-Ethan.

07:21.720 --> 07:23.560
If you could.

07:23.600 --> 07:24.800
Thank you.

07:47.399 --> 07:50.600
-Um, I guess you may as
well finish up now.

07:54.079 --> 07:54.920
-Loo, I'm sorry.

07:54.959 --> 07:56.199
I can't give you
anymore shifts.

07:56.240 --> 07:57.519
We're dish pit rich
at the moment.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.800
-It is a popular career
choice, isn't it?

07:59.839 --> 08:02.360
-But, my best waitress is
deserting us to discover her

08:02.399 --> 08:04.560
sense of superiority in
[inaudible], so if you feel

08:04.600 --> 08:06.199
like waiting tables--

08:06.240 --> 08:07.160
-Jess, I--

08:07.199 --> 08:08.319
I dream about waiting tables.

08:08.360 --> 08:10.519
That's what I was put
on this Earth to do.

08:10.560 --> 08:12.319
Waiting and then dancing.

08:12.360 --> 08:13.519
-Pay is better, and
there are tips.

08:16.839 --> 08:18.800
-I don't suppose it's occurred
to you how fawning it looks

08:18.839 --> 08:21.800
picking the solo that
made Saskia famous?

08:21.839 --> 08:23.680
-That's not why I've
chosen it.

08:23.720 --> 08:24.480
-Ah, right.

08:24.519 --> 08:25.680
Sorry.

08:25.720 --> 08:27.600
Because it speaks to you
on an emotional level.

08:27.639 --> 08:28.399
-Hey, Grace.

08:28.439 --> 08:29.279
Can I borrow you for a sec?

08:29.319 --> 08:30.240
In private?

08:30.279 --> 08:32.320
-Ah, share with the
roomie then.

08:32.360 --> 08:33.519
You're amongst friends.

08:33.558 --> 08:34.279
-OK.

08:34.320 --> 08:38.519
Um, showcase is coming up.

08:38.558 --> 08:39.679
Agents are in the audience.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.320
Great exposure for emerging
choreographers.

08:41.360 --> 08:42.759
-I don't choreograph.

08:42.799 --> 08:45.320
-I know I'm trying to do
something myself, actually.

08:45.360 --> 08:47.399
Look, you were great at
the launch, and I

08:47.440 --> 08:49.480
need a dancer, so--

08:49.519 --> 08:51.080
-So, but um, yeah.

08:51.120 --> 08:52.159
I don't think I'm right
for your piece.

08:52.200 --> 08:53.679
-Why not?

08:53.720 --> 08:54.559
-Disinterest.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.639
But, um, ask one
of these guys.

09:00.559 --> 09:02.080
-Abigail.

09:02.120 --> 09:04.799
-Thanks.

09:04.840 --> 09:07.440
-If it's good, can I use
it in a repertoire?

09:11.240 --> 09:12.519
-OK, plates are shaking,
stop that.

09:12.559 --> 09:13.639
-Yeah, got it.

09:13.679 --> 09:14.639
-Get your thumb out
of the chorizo.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.159
-It's so hot, burning me now.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.399
-OK.

09:17.440 --> 09:18.720
They'll see you approaching
with their meals.

09:18.759 --> 09:21.840
You will smile and say, the
paella and the chorizo.

09:21.879 --> 09:23.120
Can you remember that?

09:23.159 --> 09:25.600
-I can't even remember my
own name at this point.

09:25.639 --> 09:26.799
Go.

09:26.840 --> 09:28.200
Sammy, go.

09:47.159 --> 09:49.679
-OK, I started walking,
but it all--

09:49.720 --> 09:51.279
Everything's been going, I--

09:51.320 --> 09:53.440
-Sammy, I--

09:53.480 --> 09:56.600
I don't think this is
gonna work out.

09:56.639 --> 09:58.559
[music playing]

10:09.799 --> 10:10.919
-OK.

10:10.960 --> 10:13.679
Abigail, um, stop trying
to be so technical.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.679
Maybe show me how you feel.

10:19.320 --> 10:20.440
That's not quite what I meant.

10:20.480 --> 10:21.480
Um--

10:21.519 --> 10:24.159
-Do you even know what
you're doing?

10:24.200 --> 10:27.360
-Well, obviously it's still a
work in progress, but I think

10:27.399 --> 10:30.240
it's about frustration and
disillusionment, and--

10:30.279 --> 10:33.559
-Frustration and
disillusionment?

10:33.600 --> 10:34.720
Show me the steps for that?

10:34.759 --> 10:39.440
-Brother dearest, what
are you doing here?

10:39.480 --> 10:40.679
-Oh, it's inspiring.

10:40.720 --> 10:42.360
Can't you tell?

10:42.399 --> 10:43.799
-Right.

10:43.840 --> 10:46.759
Well, look, I'm famished, and
Natasha's cooking, so who

10:46.799 --> 10:47.600
votes greasy drive through?

10:47.639 --> 10:48.559
-We're still working.

10:48.600 --> 10:49.919
-Oh, together?

10:49.960 --> 10:52.399
You should have told me you were
hard up for a new muse.

10:52.440 --> 10:54.600
-Look, I'm trying to do
something new here, Kat, OK?

10:54.639 --> 10:56.080
-OK.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.440
-Where are you going?

10:58.480 --> 10:59.720
-Kat's right.

10:59.759 --> 11:01.279
You should look for
a new dancer.

11:01.320 --> 11:04.519
Someone meek and compliant.

11:04.559 --> 11:06.039
Oh, and FYI?

11:06.080 --> 11:09.080
Your choice of disillusionment
music gives new meaning to the

11:09.120 --> 11:10.240
word bland.

11:10.279 --> 11:11.159
-OK, cool.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.720
Uh, well, let's go eat, then.

11:30.480 --> 11:33.039
-Hello, my hero.

11:33.080 --> 11:35.159
-How long have you
been here for?

11:35.200 --> 11:37.320
-A while.

11:37.360 --> 11:39.519
-I know you want to impress
Saskia, but--

11:39.559 --> 11:42.399
-Great, so you think that
I'm sucking up, too?

11:42.440 --> 11:46.360
-I don't care if you are.

11:46.399 --> 11:47.600
-I just want her to think
that I'm good.

11:47.639 --> 11:49.039
-You are good.

11:49.080 --> 11:52.679
-Well, maybe I was last year,
but you know, Abigail just

11:52.720 --> 11:54.759
keeps getting better and better,
and Grace is just

11:54.799 --> 11:55.759
extraordinary.

11:55.799 --> 11:57.360
-How about you work
on something a

11:57.399 --> 11:59.159
little less full on?

11:59.200 --> 12:03.120
Something you can get
right by tomorrow?

12:03.159 --> 12:04.600
-So you don't think
I'm up to it?

12:04.639 --> 12:06.080
-No, I--

12:06.120 --> 12:08.759
I think it's tomorrow.

12:08.799 --> 12:10.000
-Exactly.

12:10.039 --> 12:12.440
So either stay and give
me feedback, or

12:12.480 --> 12:13.600
go and let me practice.

12:19.639 --> 12:21.120
-Look at us, all together
for dinner.

12:21.159 --> 12:22.759
Aren't we adorable?

12:22.799 --> 12:25.240
-What I find especially adorable
is how my sister let

12:25.279 --> 12:26.759
the dancers go home early.

12:26.799 --> 12:30.399
-So you had to make your own
macchiatto today, Dad.

12:30.440 --> 12:33.600
-Ah, brother, work is not on
the approved list of polite

12:33.639 --> 12:35.320
dining conversation.

12:35.360 --> 12:37.759
-Is it OK if I miss rehearsal
in the morning?

12:37.799 --> 12:39.679
I'm working on a solo
for Showcase.

12:39.720 --> 12:41.000
-Actually, no.

12:41.039 --> 12:42.480
One of the principles of the
job is you get paid for

12:42.519 --> 12:43.960
turning up.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.399
-Well, it seems a little bit
like a waste of the company's

12:45.440 --> 12:47.600
money when all I do is make
suggestions that you ignore.

12:47.639 --> 12:49.600
-I keep an open mind.

12:49.639 --> 12:52.240
I only ignore notes that are
inadequately thought out or

12:52.279 --> 12:53.440
incredibly juvenile.

12:58.600 --> 13:01.000
-Abigail.

13:01.039 --> 13:03.159
Hold up.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.759
Hi.

13:04.799 --> 13:08.799
Well, OK, look, before you say
anything, I've got a clear

13:08.840 --> 13:10.759
idea of what I want out
of the solo piece.

13:10.799 --> 13:13.320
And I'm rethinking the music,
so that last piece is gone.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.360
-If you want me to be
like Tara, I can't.

13:15.399 --> 13:18.120
I can't dance like her,
and I don't want to.

13:18.159 --> 13:19.360
-I want you.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.360
Not Tara, or Grace.

13:21.399 --> 13:21.840
You.

13:21.879 --> 13:24.000
No one else.

13:24.039 --> 13:25.559
-Why?

13:25.600 --> 13:29.360
Because this piece needs to be
angry, and messed up, and more

13:29.399 --> 13:30.559
than a little frightening.

13:30.600 --> 13:33.159
Frankly, no one does that
as good as you.

13:39.639 --> 13:45.200
-So, who wants to impress
me by going first?

13:45.240 --> 13:46.440
Abigail?

13:46.480 --> 13:47.879
What have you been working on?

13:47.919 --> 13:49.600
-Sorry, I'm afraid I'm just
going to need a little more

13:49.639 --> 13:51.440
time to find the perfect solo.

13:51.480 --> 13:51.799
-OK.

13:51.840 --> 13:52.600
Sure.

13:52.639 --> 13:53.799
Next class, then.

13:56.639 --> 13:58.120
Grace?

13:58.159 --> 13:59.440
-Uh, Lilac Fairy.

13:59.480 --> 14:00.519
Boring, I know.

14:00.559 --> 14:02.279
-And extremely difficult.

14:02.320 --> 14:03.480
-I've done it before.

14:30.759 --> 14:33.559
-Are we dancing the part of
the ugly stepsister from

14:33.600 --> 14:36.159
Cinderella?

14:36.200 --> 14:38.039
Yeah, thanks for that.

14:38.080 --> 14:40.120
-Hey, I would have chosen
you a better one, but

14:40.159 --> 14:41.759
this is just funnier.

14:41.799 --> 14:42.799
-Sammy.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.120
it was good enough for
Robert Helpmann.

14:44.159 --> 14:45.320
Do your worst.

14:59.519 --> 15:02.159
Who's next?

15:02.200 --> 15:06.279
-I'm going to be dancing
Victoria from The Red Shoes.

15:06.320 --> 15:09.440
-Well, that's one I'm definitely
familiar with.

15:09.480 --> 15:13.720
I can't wait to see what
you've done with it.

-Wow, Tara.

16:25.720 --> 16:28.399
That was kind of--

16:28.440 --> 16:33.080
well, it was kind of
a mess, wasn't it?

16:33.120 --> 16:36.240
I mean, full marks for
attempting something so

16:36.279 --> 16:39.679
demanding, but wow.

16:39.720 --> 16:44.080
I'm gonna need a minute to shake
that one out of my head.

16:50.320 --> 16:51.480
-Thank you, Saskia.

16:54.480 --> 16:57.399
-Hey.

16:57.440 --> 16:58.159
-You were right.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.279
Should have listened.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.320
-No.

17:01.360 --> 17:02.480
I was wrong.

17:02.519 --> 17:04.319
And so was Saskia.

17:04.358 --> 17:06.319
-You were incredible.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.319
-I really thought The Red Shoes
would suit me, but I

17:08.358 --> 17:10.200
guess I should start working
on another solo.

17:10.240 --> 17:11.400
Something simpler.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.279
-It did suit you.

17:13.319 --> 17:15.720
And just because she's your idol
doesn't make her right.

17:22.118 --> 17:24.039
-I hope you realize how lucky
you are to have me.

17:38.799 --> 17:39.480
I don't mind it.

17:39.519 --> 17:40.759
-Yeah, it's good.

17:40.799 --> 17:43.119
Just needs to be fuller.

17:43.160 --> 17:45.240
Maybe we can push that jete
a little bit further.

17:45.279 --> 17:46.119
-OK.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.000
-It's good.

17:47.039 --> 17:48.799
-Ethan?

17:48.839 --> 17:50.559
-I thought I made it clear
that I expected you at

17:50.599 --> 17:51.920
rehearsals this morning.

17:51.960 --> 17:53.359
-And I told you I needed to work
on my solo for Showcase

17:53.400 --> 17:55.160
with Abigail.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.039
-Abigail.

17:56.079 --> 17:57.240
Could you give us a moment?

18:06.640 --> 18:09.440
Do you have such a sense of
entitlement that you think you

18:09.480 --> 18:13.160
don't even need to
turn up, huh?

18:13.200 --> 18:15.400
Do you know how badly
this reflects on me?

18:15.440 --> 18:17.799
How many strings I had to pull
for you to even get this job?

18:17.839 --> 18:18.599
-How's Saskia, Dad?

18:18.640 --> 18:19.720
-What?

18:19.759 --> 18:21.119
-You know, I get it.

18:21.160 --> 18:22.559
She's your soulmate, right?

18:22.599 --> 18:24.720
Just like my Mom was until
Natasha came along.

18:24.759 --> 18:27.680
Interesting how your soulmates
keep getting 15 years younger.

18:27.720 --> 18:29.279
-Ethan, I don't know
what you have

18:29.319 --> 18:31.119
assumed, but you're wrong.

18:31.160 --> 18:34.240
There is nothing going on
there, or anywhere.

18:34.279 --> 18:35.599
-For Kat's sake, I want
to believe you.

18:35.640 --> 18:37.160
This family thing means
a lot to her.

18:37.200 --> 18:37.799
-I know that.

18:37.839 --> 18:39.759
-If you mess it up--

18:39.799 --> 18:44.240
-You don't think very much
of me, do you, Ethan?

18:44.279 --> 18:45.359
That's what this is all about.

18:45.400 --> 18:48.759
It's not about your
sister or Saskia.

18:48.799 --> 18:52.359
You think I'm the monster
that's keeping you down.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.279
You want to be a hotshot
choreographer, and you want to

18:54.319 --> 18:55.759
be it right this second.

18:55.799 --> 18:58.000
But you're not good enough,
you're not ready yet, and I'm

18:58.039 --> 19:00.240
not going to let you go
out in public and fall

19:00.279 --> 19:02.200
flat on your face.

19:02.240 --> 19:04.279
You're a Karamakov,
do you understand?

19:04.319 --> 19:06.519
People will be watching you.

19:06.559 --> 19:08.759
-How are you so convinced
that I'm gonna fail?

19:08.799 --> 19:11.519
Huh?

19:11.559 --> 19:13.440
Maybe I'll be good.

19:13.480 --> 19:15.440
Maybe I'll even be
as good as you.

19:26.640 --> 19:28.160
-Last chance, Sammy.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.599
Our budget can't cover
anymore breakages.

19:30.640 --> 19:32.480
-I've got it.

19:32.519 --> 19:37.240
Um, can you turn that up?

19:37.279 --> 19:38.000
I'm a dancer.

19:38.039 --> 19:40.319
I work better with music.

19:40.359 --> 19:44.599
[music playing]

20:32.319 --> 20:33.240
-There you go.

20:33.279 --> 20:34.480
Enjoy.

20:38.279 --> 20:41.200
Dad got to gran first
and talked her out

20:41.240 --> 20:42.400
of paying my fees.

20:42.440 --> 20:44.599
-How many hours have
you been working?

20:44.640 --> 20:47.440
-A lot.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.640
But don't worry.

20:48.680 --> 20:50.319
I can work more, because
I've arranged for some

20:50.359 --> 20:51.279
extra shifts here.

20:51.319 --> 20:53.119
-Look, that's not
what I meant.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.240
Sammy, you can't support
yourself, pay your fees, and

20:55.279 --> 20:57.359
keep up your academy schedule.

20:57.400 --> 20:58.680
-I'm fine.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.119
It's just, if you give me a
bit more time, I'll have

21:00.160 --> 21:01.759
enough money to pay
for this semester.

21:01.799 --> 21:03.559
-And after that?

21:03.599 --> 21:06.599
-If I really pushed myself,
I thought there might be a

21:06.640 --> 21:10.319
chance I could try for a
scholarship next semester.

21:10.359 --> 21:13.079
I know I'm not top
of the year.

21:13.119 --> 21:14.519
OK?

21:14.559 --> 21:16.960
And obviously I have to really
ace my exams, but it's not

21:17.000 --> 21:20.319
much of a plan, but it's
all I've got, so--

21:20.359 --> 21:24.000
-Well, then, you'll probably
need some extra coaching.

21:27.279 --> 21:31.319
-So you're ditching me for a
boathouse in Bondi, where

21:31.359 --> 21:33.519
nobody ever cleans the toilet?

21:33.559 --> 21:36.359
-You know, everything I
have comes from him.

21:36.400 --> 21:39.160
My job, my car, this house.

21:39.200 --> 21:42.079
He's not gonna respect me if I
don't do something on my own.

21:42.119 --> 21:44.079
And I respect myself.

21:44.119 --> 21:46.279
-You know, for a while I thought
things were looking up

21:46.319 --> 21:47.480
around here.

21:47.519 --> 21:49.400
I guess our family isn't
meant to be adorable.

21:53.160 --> 21:54.319
Always.

-You're still here?

22:07.160 --> 22:09.519

you're upset.

22:19.240 --> 22:21.599
You should know.

-I understand why you'd want
to take on something as

22:26.799 --> 22:29.680

as Red Shoes.

22:29.720 --> 22:31.720
Of course I do.

22:31.759 --> 22:37.039
But you don't have the depth or
the life experiences yet to

22:37.079 --> 22:39.400
take on the big emotional
ones.
