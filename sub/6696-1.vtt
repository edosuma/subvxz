00:23.223 --> 00:30.162
Double, double, toil and trouble;
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.

00:30.201 --> 00:36.120
Pour in sow's blood that hath eaten her nine farrow;

00:36.120 --> 00:40.236
grease that's sweaten from the muderer's gibbet throw into the flame;

00:40.236 --> 00:46.233
finger of birth-strangled babe, ditch-deliver'd by a drab;

00:46.233 --> 00:50.545
Make the gruel thick and slab,

00:50.584 --> 00:54.309
like a hell-broth boil and bubble,

00:54.309 --> 00:57.876
for a charm of powerful trouble.

00:57.915 --> 01:01.365
When shall we three meet again?

01:01.365 --> 01:06.068
In thunder, lightening or in rain?

01:06.068 --> 01:08.499
When the hurlyburly's done.

01:08.499 --> 01:13.202
When the battle's lost and won.

01:13.202 --> 01:16.417
That will be ere the set of sun.

01:16.417 --> 01:18.572
Where to meet with

01:21.042 --> 01:22.610
Macbeth?

01:24.000 --> 01:30.074

02:42.969 --> 02:47.438
By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes.

02:48.300 --> 02:51.475
So foul and fair a day I have not seen.

02:51.475 --> 02:59.432
A drum, a drum! Macbeth doth come.

02:59.472 --> 03:05.978
All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!

03:05.978 --> 03:10.056
What are these that look not like the
inhabitants o' the earth, and yet are on't?

03:10.094 --> 03:12.329
Speak, if you can: what are you?

03:12.369 --> 03:13.309
Hail!
/What is't you do?

03:13.309 --> 03:14.642
Hail!

03:14.642 --> 03:15.700
Hail!

03:15.700 --> 03:21.071
Hail to thee, thane of Cawdor.

03:21.110 --> 03:30.792
All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!

03:30.831 --> 03:36.671
If you can look into the seeds time and say
which grain will grow and which will not,

03:36.671 --> 03:38.240
speak then to me,

03:38.240 --> 03:41.729
who neither beg nor fear your favours nor your hate.

03:41.767 --> 03:45.139
Hail!

03:45.139 --> 03:48.510
Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.

03:48.510 --> 03:52.587
Not so happy, yet much happier.

03:52.587 --> 03:57.565
Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none.

03:57.604 --> 04:03.602
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!

04:05.484 --> 04:08.815
Go herefrom! Leave!

04:08.854 --> 04:13.049
Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more.

04:13.049 --> 04:15.949
I am thane of Glamis, but how of Cawdor?

04:15.949 --> 04:18.301
the thane of Cawdor lives, a prosperous gentleman;

04:18.301 --> 04:21.476
and to be king stands not within the prospect of relief,

04:21.476 --> 04:23.711
no more than to be Cawdor.

04:23.711 --> 04:25.200
My lord, Macbeth!

04:26.454 --> 04:27.905
Kind gentlemen.

04:27.944 --> 04:31.315
The king hath happily received, Macbeth, the news of thy success

04:31.355 --> 04:34.725
As thick as hail came post with post and every one did bear

04:34.725 --> 04:37.038
thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,

04:37.038 --> 04:40.370
We give thee from our royal master thanks.

04:40.370 --> 04:43.546
He bade us, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor.

04:43.546 --> 04:44.996
What, can the devil speak true?

04:44.996 --> 04:49.269
In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!
for it is thine.

04:49.269 --> 04:53.424
The thane of Cawdor lives. Why do you dress me in borrow'd robes?

04:53.463 --> 04:55.110
Who was the thane lives yet;

04:55.149 --> 04:59.892
but under heavy judgment bears that life which he deserves to lose.

04:59.931 --> 05:04.086
Treasons capital, confess'd and proved have overthrown him.

05:04.125 --> 05:07.183
Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!

05:07.222 --> 05:09.378
The greatest is behind.

05:09.417 --> 05:15.179
This supernatural soliciting cannot be ill, cannot be good

05:15.179 --> 05:23.098
If ill, why hath it given me earnest of success, commencing in a truth?

05:23.137 --> 05:26.939
I am thane of Cawdor.

05:33.368 --> 05:41.482
If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
whose horrid image doth unfix my hair,

05:41.521 --> 05:46.069
and make my seated heart knock at my ribs against the use of nature?

05:46.069 --> 05:49.361
Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.

05:49.361 --> 05:57.279
Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought with things forgotten.

05:58.377 --> 06:08.412
He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear,
he hopes 'bove wisdom, grace and fear

06:09.863 --> 06:11.548
Let us toward the king.

06:21.074 --> 06:23.504
Hail!

06:26.796 --> 06:31.500
Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the king,

06:31.500 --> 06:35.538
who all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor',

06:35.538 --> 06:39.967
by which title, before, these weird sisters saluted me,

06:40.007 --> 06:48.983
and referred me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that shalt be!'

06:58.234 --> 07:07.015
Stars, hide your fires, let not light see my black and deep desires:

07:08.230 --> 07:09.680
Lord Banqou!

07:10.543 --> 07:14.306
Do you not hope your children shall be kings,

07:14.306 --> 07:21.597
when those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me promised no less to them?

07:21.597 --> 07:29.359
That trusted home might yet enkindle you
unto the crown, besides the thane of Cawdor.

07:30.103 --> 07:37.747
But 'tis strange: and oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
the instruments of darkness tell us truths,

07:37.747 --> 07:44.568
Win us with honest trifles, to betray's in deepest consequence.

07:49.115 --> 07:51.191
Your children shall be kings.

07:51.701 --> 07:53.817
You shall be king.

07:57.306 --> 08:05.264
If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me, without my stir.

08:05.970 --> 08:08.400
Look, how our partner's rapt.

08:12.947 --> 08:16.358
Hail, king that shalt be!

08:17.612 --> 08:24.236
This have I thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness,

08:24.236 --> 08:32.861
that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing,
by being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee.

08:32.900 --> 08:37.250
Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.

08:41.798 --> 08:52.577
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be what thou art promised.

08:55.282 --> 09:04.690
Come, you spirits that tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,

09:04.730 --> 09:12.922
and fill me from the crown to the toe top-full of direst cruelty!

09:13.628 --> 09:15.627
Make thick my blood;

09:15.666 --> 09:21.741
Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
That no compunctious visitings of nature,

09:21.741 --> 09:26.877
Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between the effect and it!

09:27.700 --> 09:36.128
Come to my woman's breasts, and take my milk for gall,

09:36.167 --> 09:43.889
you murdering ministers, wherever in your
sightless substances you wait on nature's mischief!

09:44.752 --> 09:53.886
Come, thick night,
and pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,

09:53.886 --> 09:57.648
that my keen knife see not the wound it makes,

09:57.648 --> 10:01.098
nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,

10:01.098 --> 10:03.489
to cry 'Hold, hold!'

11:36.744 --> 11:40.082
Great Glamis, worthy Cawdor!

11:40.106 --> 11:45.588
Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!

11:48.543 --> 11:52.854
Thy letters have transported me beyond this ignorant present,

11:52.854 --> 11:57.716
and I feel now the future in the instant.

12:02.498 --> 12:03.988
My dearest love,

12:07.790 --> 12:10.612
Duncan comes here to-night.

12:10.730 --> 12:14.375
And when goes hence?

12:16.218 --> 12:19.707
To-morrow, as he purposes.

12:21.744 --> 12:26.096
He that's coming must be provided for.

12:29.859 --> 12:32.094
We will speak further.

12:32.132 --> 12:35.895
Put this night's business into my dispatch.

13:15.918 --> 13:22.739
Your face, my thane, is as a book where men may read strange matters.

13:23.601 --> 13:28.619
To beguile the time, look like the time;

13:28.619 --> 13:31.715
Bear welcome in your eye, your hand, your tongue.

13:31.715 --> 13:40.613
Look like the innocent flower, but be the serpent under't.

14:19.656 --> 14:27.379
When Duncan is asleep, whereto the rather shall
his day's hard journey soundly invite him,

14:28.084 --> 14:31.259
I'll drug his servents' wine

14:44.705 --> 14:47.174
King Duncan is my kinsman.

14:47.369 --> 14:50.310
He hath borne his faculties so meek.

14:50.977 --> 14:57.092
hath been so clear in his great office, that his virtues will plead like angels,

14:57.092 --> 15:00.815
trumpet-tongued, against the deep damnation of his taking-off;

15:01.208 --> 15:07.283
And pity, like a naked new-born babe, striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim,

15:07.283 --> 15:11.909
horsed upon the sightless couriers of the air, shall blow the horrid deed

15:11.909 --> 15:15.946
in every eye, that tears shall drown the wind.

15:16.809 --> 15:22.257
Saint Michael, the archy angel, be our safeguard
against the viles and wickedness of the devil.

15:22.845 --> 15:27.353
Do thou, oh prince of the heavenly host, by the divine power,

15:27.392 --> 15:31.391
thrust into hell satan and the other evil spirits,

15:31.391 --> 15:35.389
who wrong through the world, seeking the ruin of souls.

15:36.487 --> 15:37.506
Amen!

15:43.307 --> 15:45.189
Thus thou renounce satan?

15:45.502 --> 15:47.619
I renounce him.

15:47.619 --> 15:49.109
And all his works?

15:49.265 --> 15:50.951
I renounce them.

15:51.382 --> 15:53.185
And all his palms?

15:53.224 --> 15:55.303
I renounce them.

15:56.713 --> 15:59.026
Amen!

16:03.652 --> 16:08.826
My son, is execution done on Cawdor?

16:09.140 --> 16:10.394
My liege, it is.

16:10.418 --> 16:13.922
And very frankly he confess'd his treasons,

16:13.922 --> 16:19.605
implored your highness' pardon and set forth a deep repentance.

16:21.527 --> 16:26.936
Nothing in his life became him like the leaving it;

16:26.976 --> 16:30.503
He died as one that had been studied in his death,

16:30.503 --> 16:36.735
to throw away the dearest thing he owed, as 'twere a careless trifle.

16:36.735 --> 16:42.773
There's no art to find the mind's
construction in the face: he was a gentleman,

16:42.773 --> 16:45.673
on whom I built an absolute trust.

16:45.791 --> 16:48.574
But where is Macbeth, the thane of Cawdor?

16:50.181 --> 16:51.910
Oh, worthy Cawdor!

16:51.935 --> 16:55.081
Would thou hadst less deserved,

16:55.120 --> 16:59.001
that the proportion both of thanks and payment might have been mine!

16:59.158 --> 17:03.195
The service and the loyalty I owe in doing it, pays itself.

17:03.665 --> 17:08.605
Noble Banquo, thou hadst no less deserved,

17:08.644 --> 17:11.113
nor must be known no less to have done so.

17:11.858 --> 17:13.269
Give me your hand.

17:33.967 --> 17:41.376
This guest of summer, the temple-haunting martlet,
does approve, by his loved mansionry,

17:41.376 --> 17:44.982
that the heaven's breath smells wooingly here.

17:47.412 --> 17:52.978
No jutty, frieze, buttress, nor coign of vantage,

17:52.978 --> 17:58.231
but this bird hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle,

17:58.231 --> 18:04.464
where they most breed and haunt, I have observed, the air is delicate.

18:05.640 --> 18:11.912
If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well it were done quickly.

18:11.912 --> 18:19.281
If the assassination could trammel up the consequence
and catch with his surcease success,

18:19.281 --> 18:24.181
that but this blow might be the be-all and the end-all here.

18:24.181 --> 18:32.256
But here, upon this bank and shoal of time, we'ld jump the life to come.

18:32.256 --> 18:37.195
But in these cases we still have judgment here
that we but teach bloody instructions,

18:37.234 --> 18:39.821
which, being taught, return to plague the inventor

18:39.821 --> 18:44.094
this even-handed justice commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice

18:44.094 --> 18:46.055
to our own lips.

18:58.441 --> 19:02.635
When in swinish sleep their drenched natures lie as in a death,

19:03.106 --> 19:06.634
what cannot you and I perform upon the unguarded Duncan?

19:06.634 --> 19:11.573
What not put upon his spongy officers,
who shall bear the guilt of our great quell?

19:13.102 --> 19:15.062
Bring forth men-children only;

19:16.199 --> 19:20.275
For thy undaunted mettle should compose nothing but males.

19:24.861 --> 19:25.253
Fiten!

19:29.134 --> 19:32.152
Will it not be received, when we have mark'd with blood
those sleepy two of his own chamber

19:32.152 --> 19:35.171
and used their very daggers, that they have done't?

19:35.171 --> 19:39.483
Who dares receive it other, as we shall make
our griefs and clamour roar upon his death?

19:49.401 --> 19:51.204
Leave all the rest to me.

19:56.887 --> 19:59.160
How goes the night, boy?

19:59.160 --> 20:01.552
The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.

20:03.669 --> 20:04.845
Hold, take my sword.

20:10.450 --> 20:15.625
There's husbandry in heaven; their candles are all out.

20:17.349 --> 20:18.799
Take thee that too.

20:22.915 --> 20:27.384
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me, and yet I would not sleep.

20:29.109 --> 20:31.147
Merciful powers,

20:32.362 --> 20:36.518
restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature gives way to in repose!

20:37.928 --> 20:39.105
Give me my sword.

20:39.380 --> 20:40.124
Who's there?

20:40.790 --> 20:41.574
A friend.

20:47.298 --> 20:49.296
What, sir, not yet at rest?

20:53.138 --> 20:54.353
The king's a-bed.

20:55.059 --> 20:59.527
He hath been in unusual pleasure, and
sent forth great largess to your offices.

20:59.880 --> 21:03.016
This diamond he greets your wife withal.

21:13.286 --> 21:16.109
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:

21:17.363 --> 21:19.049
To you they have show'd some truth.

21:20.382 --> 21:21.440
I think not of them.

21:27.633 --> 21:28.927
Good repose the while!

21:29.123 --> 21:32.808
Thanks, sir: the like to you!

21:55.465 --> 22:03.932
Now o'er the one halfworld nature seems dead,

22:05.108 --> 22:08.557
and wicked dreams abuse the curtain'd sleep.

22:09.694 --> 22:15.653
witchcraft celebrates pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,

22:16.319 --> 22:20.552
Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf, whose howl's his watch,

22:21.689 --> 22:23.492
thus with his stealthy pace.

22:23.531 --> 22:32.469
with Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design moves like a ghost.

22:35.644 --> 22:41.603
Is this a dagger which I see before me, the handle toward my hand?

22:41.603 --> 22:43.131
Come, let me clutch thee.

22:43.131 --> 22:46.699
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.

22:49.638 --> 22:51.794
Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;

22:53.794 --> 22:57.557
Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible to feeling as to sight?

22:57.557 --> 23:04.612
or art thou but a dagger of the mind, a false creation,
proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?

23:05.984 --> 23:11.590
I see thee still, and on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,

23:11.590 --> 23:14.922
which was not so before.

23:14.922 --> 23:17.548
There's no such thing.

23:32.521 --> 23:33.266
What news?

23:34.717 --> 23:37.147
The doors are open;

23:39.263 --> 23:43.105
and the surfeited grooms do mock their charge with snores.

23:50.083 --> 23:52.709
We will proceed no further in this business.

23:53.924 --> 23:57.710
Was the hope drunk wherein you dress'd yourself?

23:57.735 --> 23:59.333
hath it slept since?

23:59.333 --> 24:03.802
and wakes it now, to look so green
and pale on what it did so freely?

24:05.174 --> 24:08.624
From this time such I account thy love.

24:09.800 --> 24:15.954
Art thou afeard to be the same in thine
own act and valour as thou art in desire?

24:16.268 --> 24:18.424
I dare do all that may become a man;

24:19.561 --> 24:21.011
who dares do more is none.

24:21.011 --> 24:24.264
What beast was't, then, that made you break this enterprise to me?

24:25.872 --> 24:30.183
When you durst do it, then you were a man;

24:32.261 --> 24:37.906
And, to be more than what you were, you would be so much more the man.

24:39.003 --> 24:49.078
I have given suck, and know how tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me.

24:50.018 --> 24:58.877
I would, while it was smiling in my face,
have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,

24:58.877 --> 25:03.777
and dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you have done to this.

25:03.777 --> 25:04.835
If we should fail?

25:04.835 --> 25:06.011
We fail!

25:07.618 --> 25:14.126
But screw your courage to the sticking-place, and we'll not fail.

25:21.887 --> 25:28.629
Thou sure and firm-set earth, hear not my steps, which way they walk,

25:30.236 --> 25:33.568
for fear thy very stones prate of my whereabout.

25:33.568 --> 25:37.018
I go and it is done; the bell invites me.

25:37.724 --> 25:44.270
Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell
that summons thee to heaven or to hell.

25:53.443 --> 25:58.539
That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;

25:59.362 --> 26:05.516
What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.

26:14.767 --> 26:15.472
Hark!

26:19.314 --> 26:20.137
Peace!

26:23.077 --> 26:26.253
It was the owl that shriek'd.

26:30.329 --> 26:33.348
He is about it.

26:33.348 --> 26:34.524
Who's there? What, ho!

26:35.347 --> 26:36.091
Alack!

26:38.169 --> 26:41.305
I am afraid they have awaked, and 'tis not done.

26:43.579 --> 26:46.518
The attempt and not the deed confounds us.

26:49.694 --> 26:50.517
Hark!

26:54.084 --> 26:58.513
I laid their daggers ready; he could not miss 'em.

27:08.980 --> 27:11.643
I have done the deed.

27:11.667 --> 27:15.471
Didst thou not hear a noise?

27:15.722 --> 27:17.761
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.

27:17.878 --> 27:19.132
Did not you speak? /When?
/Now.

27:19.132 --> 27:20.622
As I descended?/ Ay.
/Hark!

27:23.954 --> 27:26.227
This is a sorry sight.

27:26.345 --> 27:28.619
A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.

27:29.716 --> 27:36.067
There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried 'Murder!'

27:36.811 --> 27:39.163
That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them.

27:40.260 --> 27:44.533
But they did say their prayers, and address'd them again to sleep.

27:44.572 --> 27:45.749
There are two lodged together.

27:45.749 --> 27:51.315
One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other,

27:53.510 --> 27:57.273
as they had seen me with these hangman's hands.

27:58.684 --> 28:01.820
Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'

28:03.584 --> 28:05.034
when they did say 'God bless us!'

28:05.034 --> 28:06.838
Consider it not so deeply.

28:06.994 --> 28:10.091
But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?

28:12.247 --> 28:14.756
I had most need of blessing,

28:17.461 --> 28:20.635
and 'Amen' stuck in my throat.

28:21.067 --> 28:25.144
These deeds must not be thought after these ways;

28:26.673 --> 28:28.123
so, it will make us mad.

28:29.220 --> 28:32.082
Had I but died an hour before this chance,

28:34.355 --> 28:35.845
I had lived a blessed time

28:36.551 --> 28:40.353
for, from this instant, there 's nothing serious in mortality:

28:40.941 --> 28:45.449
All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;

28:46.546 --> 28:52.701
the wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees is left this vault to brag of.

28:55.170 --> 28:57.875
Go get some water,

28:57.914 --> 29:01.285
and wash this filthy witness from your hand.

29:04.265 --> 29:07.165
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?

29:07.871 --> 29:08.930
They must lie there

29:09.557 --> 29:13.084
Go carry them; and smear the sleepy grooms with blood.

29:15.515 --> 29:16.848
I'll go no more.

29:19.082 --> 29:21.002
I am afraid to think what I have done.

29:23.001 --> 29:25.040
Look on't again I dare not.

29:25.824 --> 29:27.823
Infirm of purpose!

29:29.509 --> 29:31.508
Give me the daggers.

29:34.174 --> 29:36.761
The sleeping and the dead are but as pictures

29:36.761 --> 29:40.563
'tis the eye of childhood that fears a painted devil.

29:43.307 --> 29:48.559
If he do bleed, I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal,

29:49.735 --> 29:51.578
for it must seem their guilt.

29:54.440 --> 29:55.537
Whence is that knocking?

29:56.596 --> 30:00.319
How is't with me, when every noise appals me?

30:01.025 --> 30:02.475
What hands are here?

30:05.141 --> 30:07.532
Ha! They pluck out mine eyes.

30:10.433 --> 30:13.686
Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood clean from my hand?

30:14.902 --> 30:21.291
No, this my hand will rather the multitudinous seas in incarnadine,

30:23.330 --> 30:28.073
making the green one red.

30:29.562 --> 30:32.189
My hands are of your colour;

30:33.247 --> 30:36.461
but I shame to wear a heart so white.

30:40.851 --> 30:42.616
Retire we to our chamber;

30:43.713 --> 30:46.849
A little water clears us of this deed.

30:47.946 --> 30:50.102
How easy is it, then!

30:53.160 --> 30:55.198
Hark! More knocking.

30:56.570 --> 31:02.019
Get on your nightgown lest occasion call us,
and show us to be watchers.

31:04.645 --> 31:08.604
To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.

31:10.211 --> 31:14.523
Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!

31:22.285 --> 31:24.088
Who's there?

31:25.107 --> 31:27.656
Knock, knock! Never at quiet!

31:31.379 --> 31:35.338
Knock, knock! Knock, knock! Knock!

31:46.000 --> 31:47.529
It is Macduff!

31:47.569 --> 31:50.508
Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed, that you do lie so late?

31:50.548 --> 31:53.723
Faith sir, we were carousing till the second cock.

31:53.997 --> 31:55.291
Is thy master stirring?

31:56.937 --> 31:57.643
Macduff!

32:00.190 --> 32:01.485
Good morrow, noble sir.

32:04.111 --> 32:04.973
Good morrow, both.

32:05.601 --> 32:07.090
Is the king stirring, worthy thane?

32:08.423 --> 32:08.737
Not yet.

32:09.364 --> 32:13.793
He did command me to call timely on him:
I have almost slipp'd the hour.

32:14.224 --> 32:15.008
There is the door.

32:17.948 --> 32:19.398
I'll make so bold to call.

32:26.572 --> 32:28.414
Goes the king hence to-day?

32:29.276 --> 32:31.629
He does: he did appoint so.

32:34.138 --> 32:39.311
The night has been unruly: where we lay,
our chimneys were blown down;

32:40.291 --> 32:44.094
As they say, lamentings heard i' the air

32:44.643 --> 32:46.525
Strange screams of death,

32:47.426 --> 32:53.071
and prophesying with accents terrible
of dire combustion and confused events

32:53.110 --> 32:55.461
new hatch'd to the woeful time,

32:55.461 --> 33:01.185
the obscure bird clamour'd the livelong night,

33:01.812 --> 33:08.201
Some say, the earth was feverous and did shake.

33:09.338 --> 33:10.514
'Twas a rough night.

33:11.259 --> 33:12.592
Murder and treason!

33:15.885 --> 33:16.512
What is 't you say?

33:16.747 --> 33:17.609
Mean you his majesty?

33:17.845 --> 33:19.373
Ring the alarum-bell.

33:19.765 --> 33:21.647
Awake! Malcolm! Malcolm!

33:21.686 --> 33:22.823
Malcolm! Awake!

33:28.272 --> 33:29.722
My lord!
/ Murder and treason!

33:30.741 --> 33:32.152
Malcolm, Malcolm!

33:32.177 --> 33:33.586
Malcolm! Awake!

33:40.384 --> 33:41.286
Husband!

33:42.657 --> 33:45.245
Horror, horror, horror!

33:45.245 --> 33:49.518
Tongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee!

33:50.851 --> 33:53.124
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!

33:53.163 --> 33:54.848
What's the matter.

33:55.358 --> 34:00.846
[New Text]

34:24.286 --> 34:25.071
What is amiss?

34:25.266 --> 34:27.266
You are, and do not know't:

34:27.306 --> 34:31.029
The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood is stopp'd.

34:31.382 --> 34:33.264
The very source of it is stopp'd.

34:33.538 --> 34:35.145
Your royal father 's murder'd.

34:41.260 --> 34:42.005
By whom?

34:42.239 --> 34:46.159
Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't:

34:46.199 --> 34:48.748
Their hands and faces were an badged with blood;

34:49.101 --> 34:50.175
So were their daggers.

34:50.199 --> 34:51.884
They stared, and were distracted.

34:51.884 --> 34:53.960
No man's life was to be trusted with them.

34:54.471 --> 34:56.822
O, yet I do repent me of my fury, that I did kill them.

34:56.940 --> 34:58.469
Wherefore did you so?

34:58.783 --> 35:03.408
Here lay Duncan, his silver skin laced with his golden blood;

35:04.741 --> 35:08.661
And his gash'd stabs look'd like
a breach in nature for ruin's wasteful entrance.

35:08.661 --> 35:11.797
There, the murderers, steep'd in the colours of their trade,

35:11.797 --> 35:14.306
their daggers unmannerly breech'd with gore:

35:14.854 --> 35:16.736
Who could refrain, that had a heart to love?

35:16.736 --> 35:17.686
Help me, hence, ho!

35:17.710 --> 35:18.759
/ Look to the lady.

35:20.538 --> 35:24.105
And when we have our naked frailties hid, that suffer in exposure,

35:24.418 --> 35:27.359
let's meet to question this most bloody piece of work,

35:27.633 --> 35:28.574
To know it further.

35:28.770 --> 35:30.622
Fears and scruples shake us.

35:30.646 --> 35:33.027
/In the great hand of God I stand.

35:33.905 --> 35:34.572
And I.

35:35.042 --> 35:35.748
So all.

35:36.924 --> 35:38.884
How goes the world, sir, now?

35:39.824 --> 35:40.843
Why, see you not?

35:40.843 --> 35:43.274
Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?

35:43.430 --> 35:45.352
Those that Macbeth hath slain.

35:48.330 --> 35:51.780
I have seen hours dreadful and things strange,

35:51.976 --> 35:55.464
but this sore night hath trifled former knowings.

35:59.502 --> 36:06.127
By the clock, 'tis day, and yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp.

36:07.538 --> 36:13.496
Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame,
that darkness does the face of earth entomb,

36:13.927 --> 36:15.378
when living light should kiss it?

36:15.417 --> 36:17.025
'Tis unnatural,

36:17.025 --> 36:19.023
Even like the deed that's done.

36:22.238 --> 36:23.100
What will you do?

36:23.727 --> 36:24.120
Do?

36:24.120 --> 36:30.430
Where we are, there's daggers in men's smiles:
the near in blood, the nearer bloody.

36:32.547 --> 36:33.723
Therefore, to horse!

36:33.841 --> 36:34.546
My husband!

36:35.135 --> 36:37.878
And let us not be dainty of leave-taking, but shift away!

36:42.033 --> 36:42.935
Farewell, father.

36:43.758 --> 36:45.130
God's benison go with you,

36:47.482 --> 36:52.147
and with those that would make good of bad, and friends of foes!

36:52.735 --> 36:54.145
Thou hast it now:

36:57.713 --> 37:00.927
king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,

37:01.790 --> 37:03.553
As the weird women promised,

37:04.102 --> 37:08.062
and, I fear, thou play'dst most foully for't.

37:08.258 --> 37:12.138
Yet it was said, it should not stand in thy posterity,

37:12.138 --> 37:15.862
But that myself should be the root and father of many kings.

37:16.019 --> 37:21.507
If there come truth from them, as upon thee,
Macbeth, their speeches shine.

37:21.507 --> 37:26.485
Why, by the verities on thee made good,
may they not be my oracles as well,

37:26.485 --> 37:28.877
and set me up in hope?

37:30.249 --> 37:32.209
Malcolm and Macduff, my lord, are fled to England.

37:32.365 --> 37:33.423
Fled to England!

37:33.933 --> 37:36.912
We can entreat an hour to serve; we'll spend it
in some words upon that business,

37:37.539 --> 37:38.520
If you would grant the time.

37:38.951 --> 37:40.244
At your kind'st leisure.

37:40.401 --> 37:43.654
You shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,
it shall make honour for you.

37:44.243 --> 37:47.339
So I lose none in seeking to augment.

38:01.451 --> 38:04.195
You lack the season of all natures.

38:05.175 --> 38:05.645
Sleep.

38:07.292 --> 38:08.311
To bed.

38:10.035 --> 38:10.663
To bed.

38:10.820 --> 38:18.268
We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:

38:18.268 --> 38:23.442
She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice

38:23.795 --> 38:25.754
remains in danger of her former tooth.

38:25.754 --> 38:26.421
Banquo?

38:26.421 --> 38:28.890
He chid the sisters when first they put the name of king upon me,

38:28.890 --> 38:30.223
and bade them speak to him:

38:30.380 --> 38:33.281
then prophet-like they hail'd him father to a line of kings:

38:34.261 --> 38:36.260
Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown.

38:37.397 --> 38:40.337
and put a barren sceptre in my gripe.

38:41.200 --> 38:43.198
Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,

38:45.001 --> 38:46.687
No son of mine succeeding.

38:48.686 --> 38:50.881
If 't be so, for Banquo's issue have I filed my mind.

38:51.822 --> 38:54.173
For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;

38:55.074 --> 38:57.858
Put rancours in the vessel of my peace only for them.

38:58.132 --> 39:02.052
and mine eternal jewel given to the common enemy of man,

39:02.679 --> 39:04.404
to make them kings,

39:06.207 --> 39:10.049
the seed of Banquo kings!

39:11.499 --> 39:17.771
Things without all remedy should be without regard:

39:19.378 --> 39:22.357
What's done is done.

39:24.866 --> 39:25.846
To bed.

39:26.983 --> 39:28.669
To bed. Come.

39:30.511 --> 39:31.805
Liar and slave!

39:34.784 --> 39:41.604
My strange and self-abuse is the initiate fear that wants hard use:

39:43.093 --> 39:46.700
We are yet but young in deed.

40:06.457 --> 40:10.416
Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!

40:11.396 --> 40:13.082
Macbeth does murder sleep',

40:15.512 --> 40:16.648
the innocent sleep,

40:18.765 --> 40:21.862
sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care,

40:23.508 --> 40:25.468
the death of each day's life,

40:26.291 --> 40:29.466
sore labour's bath, balm of hurt minds,

40:30.329 --> 40:33.661
great nature's second course, chief nourisher in life's feast!

40:33.700 --> 40:34.445
What do you mean?

40:34.562 --> 40:38.835
Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house.

40:39.737 --> 40:44.009
'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor

40:45.420 --> 40:46.910
shall sleep no more;

40:50.085 --> 40:56.632
Macbeth shall sleep no more.'

41:05.648 --> 41:10.234
I will drain him dry as hay:

41:10.900 --> 41:15.252
Sleep shall neither night nor day.

41:15.252 --> 41:19.014
Hang upon his pent-house lid;

41:19.054 --> 41:23.757
He shall live a man forbid.

41:34.381 --> 41:36.262
To be thus is nothing

41:37.438 --> 41:39.398
but to be safely thus.

42:44.469 --> 42:46.468
What had he done, to make him fly the land?

42:47.369 --> 42:48.859
You must have patience, madam.

42:49.329 --> 42:52.622
He had none: his flight was madness:

42:53.720 --> 42:57.757
when our actions do not, our fears do make us traitors.

42:58.894 --> 43:02.853
You know not whether it was his wisdom or his fear.

43:03.598 --> 43:04.382
Wisdom!

43:05.088 --> 43:12.339
to leave his wife, to leave his babes,
all in a place from whence himself does fly?

43:37.858 --> 43:43.150
We hear, Macdoff and Malcolm are gone hence,
not confessing their cruel murders,

43:43.267 --> 43:46.208
but filling their hearers with strange invention.

43:49.696 --> 43:52.989
But of that to-morrow, here's our chief guest.

43:53.341 --> 43:58.242
If he had been forgotten, it had been as a gap in our great feast,

43:58.242 --> 44:00.907
And all-thing unbecoming.

44:01.142 --> 44:06.670
To-night we hold a solemn supper sir, and I'll request your presence.

44:07.061 --> 44:09.806
Let your highness command upon me.

44:10.001 --> 44:11.452
Ride you this afternoon?

44:11.804 --> 44:13.216
Ay, my good lord.

44:13.529 --> 44:17.842
We should have else desired your good advice, in this day's council,

44:18.390 --> 44:19.488
but we'll take to-morrow.

44:20.977 --> 44:22.114
Is't far you ride?

44:23.682 --> 44:28.856
As far, my lord, as will fill up the time 'twixt this and supper.

44:33.286 --> 44:34.775
Fail not our feast.

44:35.991 --> 44:37.911
My lord, I will not.

44:38.578 --> 44:39.283
Farewell.

44:42.223 --> 44:47.162
Let every man be master of his time till seven at night:

44:47.633 --> 44:53.277
To make society the sweeter welcome,
we will keep ourself till supper-time alone.

44:54.297 --> 44:56.139
While then, God be with you!

45:16.130 --> 45:18.600
Our fears in Banquo stick deeper.

45:21.188 --> 45:24.676
and in his royalty of nature reigns that which would be fear'd

45:26.401 --> 45:27.577
'tis much he dares;

45:29.537 --> 45:34.829
And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
he hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour to act in safety.

45:36.907 --> 45:39.023
There is none but he whose being I do fear;

45:39.023 --> 45:41.846
and, under him, my Genius is rebuked;

45:43.413 --> 45:46.942
as, it is said, Mark Antony's was by Caesar.

45:51.645 --> 45:54.977
Let the frame of things disjoint,

45:56.427 --> 45:57.996
both the worlds suffer,

46:00.269 --> 46:02.621
ere we will eat our meal in fear

46:03.366 --> 46:08.070
and sleep in the affliction of these terrible dreams that shake us nightly.

46:08.540 --> 46:09.794
Better be with the dead,

46:11.637 --> 46:14.890
Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,

46:15.126 --> 46:22.455
than on the torture of the mind to lie in restless ecstasy.

46:24.377 --> 46:25.827
Duncan is in his grave;

46:27.826 --> 46:31.825
After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;

46:33.706 --> 46:38.841
Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,

46:40.134 --> 46:42.447
malice domestic, foreign levy,

46:44.250 --> 46:49.464
nothing can touch him further.

46:54.207 --> 46:55.383
Attend those men our pleasure?

46:56.128 --> 46:57.617
They are, my lord, without the palace gate.

46:57.970 --> 46:58.872
Bring them before us.

47:36.072 --> 47:39.365
Was it not yesterday we spoke together?

47:40.070 --> 47:43.716
It was, so please your highness.

47:44.853 --> 47:51.085
Well then, now have you consider'd of my speeches?

47:53.868 --> 48:00.297
Know that it was he in the times past which held you so under fortune,

48:01.082 --> 48:02.963
which you thought had been our innocent self.

48:02.963 --> 48:05.079
You made it known to us.

48:05.354 --> 48:09.587
Do you find your patience so predominant
in your nature that you can let this go?

48:11.038 --> 48:15.546
Are you so gospell'd to pray for this good man and for his issue,

48:15.546 --> 48:18.721
whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the
grave and beggar'd yours for ever?

48:18.721 --> 48:19.936
We are men, my liege.

48:19.936 --> 48:22.837
Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;

48:22.837 --> 48:26.953
as hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,

48:26.991 --> 48:31.892
shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves are clept all by the name of dogs.

48:33.068 --> 48:37.537
But if you have a station in the file, not i' the worst rank of manhood.

48:38.908 --> 48:39.300
Say 't!

48:39.300 --> 48:40.829
I am one, my liege,

48:40.829 --> 48:45.650
whom the vile blows and buffets of the world have so incensed

48:45.650 --> 48:49.532
that I am reckless what I do to spite the world.

48:49.532 --> 48:50.472
And I another

48:50.668 --> 48:53.216
Both of you know Banquo was your enemy.

48:53.882 --> 48:54.627
True, my lord.

48:55.137 --> 48:56.391
So is he mine.

48:58.077 --> 49:02.938
and in such bloody distance that every minute of
his being thrusts against my near'st of life.

49:03.251 --> 49:05.564
We shall, my lord, perform what you command us.

49:05.642 --> 49:07.759
Your spirits shine through you.

49:08.504 --> 49:12.580
Within this hour at most I will advise you where to plant yourselves;

49:14.306 --> 49:18.539
Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time, the moment on't

49:19.009 --> 49:22.968
for't must be done to-night, and something from the castle

49:23.713 --> 49:25.360
Always thought that I require a clearness:

49:25.398 --> 49:27.673
and with him to leave no rubs nor botches in the work

49:28.143 --> 49:33.042
Fleance his son, that keeps him company,

49:33.082 --> 49:36.805
whose absence is no less material to me than is his father's

49:37.785 --> 49:40.765
Must embrace the fate of that dark hour.

49:42.921 --> 49:44.293
Resolve yourselves apart:

49:46.213 --> 49:46.997
I'll come to you anon.

49:46.997 --> 49:48.448
We are resolved, my lord.

49:48.605 --> 49:58.836
It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight,
if it find heaven, must find it out to-night.

50:03.579 --> 50:07.891
Gentle, my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks.

50:08.518 --> 50:12.477
Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.

50:13.536 --> 50:20.709
O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!

50:22.198 --> 50:28.353
Yet be thou jocund:
ere the bat hath flown his cloister'd flight,

50:28.353 --> 50:31.763
ere to black Hecate's summons the shard-borne beetle

50:31.802 --> 50:35.565
with his drowsy hums hath rung night's yawning peal,

50:36.232 --> 50:39.917
there shall be done a deed of dreadful note.

50:39.917 --> 50:41.877
What's to be done?

50:42.504 --> 50:47.756
Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,

50:48.972 --> 50:50.579
till thou applaud the deed.

50:52.656 --> 50:55.871
Come, seeling night,

50:57.125 --> 51:01.750
scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;

51:01.750 --> 51:07.395
And with thy bloody and invisible hand cancel and tear to pieces

51:07.395 --> 51:10.178
that great bond which keeps me pale!

51:11.511 --> 51:17.313
Light thickens; and the crow makes wing to the rooky wood.

51:17.587 --> 51:21.075
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse,

51:22.173 --> 51:27.583
while night's black agents to their preys do rouse.

51:35.854 --> 51:39.656
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day:

51:40.871 --> 51:45.262
Now spurs the lated traveller apace to gain the timely inn;

51:46.124 --> 51:49.416
and near approaches the subject of our watch.
/Hark!

51:52.161 --> 51:53.572
Then 'tis he.
/Stand to't.

51:54.474 --> 51:55.650
It will be rain to-night.

51:55.963 --> 51:57.178
Let it come down.

51:57.805 --> 52:01.333
Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly!

52:04.430 --> 52:05.410
The son is fled.

52:07.056 --> 52:09.055
We have lost best half of our affair.

52:12.897 --> 52:17.640
Well, let's away, and say how much is done.

52:29.164 --> 52:30.772
There's blood on thy face.

52:30.772 --> 52:32.066
'Tis Banquo's then.

52:36.573 --> 52:37.436
Is he dispatch'd?

52:37.436 --> 52:40.415
My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.

52:40.415 --> 52:42.140
Thou art the best o' the cut-throats:

52:42.140 --> 52:44.491
yet he's good that did the like for Fleance

52:45.080 --> 52:48.137
Most royal sir, Fleance is 'scaped.

52:51.312 --> 52:52.528
Then comes my fit again

52:53.155 --> 52:56.918
I had else been perfect, whole as the marble, founded as the rock,

52:56.918 --> 52:59.230
as broad and general as the casing air:

52:59.466 --> 53:06.051
But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined,
bound in to saucy doubts and fears.

53:06.756 --> 53:07.502
But Banquo's safe?

53:07.502 --> 53:13.264
Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides,
with twenty trenched gashes on his head,

53:13.538 --> 53:15.184
the least a death to nature.

53:17.027 --> 53:17.772
Thanks for that.

53:35.293 --> 53:41.291
Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all; all,

53:42.703 --> 53:44.544
as the weird women promised.

53:44.976 --> 53:48.347
And, I fear, thou play'dst most foully for't.

53:49.170 --> 53:52.463
Thou play'dst most foully for't:

53:53.286 --> 53:57.245
Yet it was said It should not stand in thy posterity,

53:57.598 --> 54:01.636
But that myself should be the root and father of many kings.

54:02.537 --> 54:03.674
Is't far you ride?

54:04.536 --> 54:08.770
As far, my lord, as will fill up the time 'twixt this and supper

54:09.594 --> 54:11.435
Fail not our feast.

54:11.750 --> 54:13.709
My lord, I will not.

54:14.336 --> 54:15.120
I will not.

54:16.140 --> 54:17.002
I will not.

54:17.864 --> 54:18.452
I will not.

54:19.981 --> 54:24.096
I will not fail your feast.

55:06.548 --> 55:08.195
You know your own degrees

55:12.899 --> 55:13.447
Sit down.

55:21.209 --> 55:23.953
And first and last the hearty welcome.

55:30.343 --> 55:33.048
Here had we now our country's honour roof'd,

55:34.498 --> 55:37.712
Were the graced person of our Banquo present;

55:37.791 --> 55:40.770
His absence, sir, lays blame upon his promise.

55:43.984 --> 55:48.296
My royal lord, you do not give the cheer.

55:49.276 --> 55:50.452
Sweet remembrancer!

55:55.548 --> 55:59.782
I drink to our good friend Banquo whom we miss!

56:02.329 --> 56:04.054
Would he were here!

56:26.163 --> 56:27.534
Which of you have done this?

56:30.788 --> 56:33.101
What is't that moves your highness?

56:35.139 --> 56:40.784
Thou canst not say I did it; Never shake thy gory locks at me.

56:40.784 --> 56:43.057
Gentlemen, rise. His highness is not well.

56:43.057 --> 56:44.860
Sit, worthy friends.

56:45.292 --> 56:48.585
My lord is often thus, and hath been from his youth.

56:49.604 --> 56:50.309
Look!

56:52.465 --> 56:53.210
Lo!

56:54.895 --> 56:55.876
How say you?

57:14.495 --> 57:19.003
Think of this, good peers, but as a thing of custom:

57:19.238 --> 57:20.297
'tis no other.

57:20.963 --> 57:23.550
Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.

57:25.471 --> 57:26.411
Shame itself!

57:26.843 --> 57:28.567
Why do you make such faces?

57:29.116 --> 57:31.469
When all's done, you look but on a stool.

57:32.135 --> 57:35.584
Avaunt! and quit my sight!

57:35.819 --> 57:37.662
Let the earth hide thee!

57:37.701 --> 57:41.386
Thy bones are marrowless; thy blood is cold.

57:41.739 --> 57:44.836
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes which thou dost glare with!

57:45.070 --> 57:49.461
The fit is momentary; upon a thought he will again be well.

57:49.461 --> 57:52.401
What man dare, I dare:

57:53.302 --> 57:58.790
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,
the arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger.

57:58.790 --> 58:05.023
Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves shall never tremble;

58:05.572 --> 58:08.551
or be alive again, and dare me to the desert with thy sword.

58:08.904 --> 58:12.471
If trembling I inhabit then, protest me the baby of a girl.

58:13.607 --> 58:15.959
Hence, horrible shadow!

58:16.665 --> 58:19.605
This is the very painting of your fear.

58:20.389 --> 58:25.250
This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said, led you to Duncan.

58:26.974 --> 58:28.033
Duncan!

58:31.600 --> 58:35.245
Why, what care I?

58:36.186 --> 58:40.851
If thou canst nod, speak too.

58:41.791 --> 58:45.867
If charnel-houses and our graves must send those that we bury back,

58:50.063 --> 58:54.061
our monuments shall be the maws of kites.

58:56.374 --> 58:58.060
Fie, for shame!

58:59.549 --> 59:03.822
Blood hath been shed ere now,

59:04.723 --> 59:08.840
i' the olden time, ere human statute purged the gentle weal

59:08.840 --> 59:16.326
Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd too terrible for the ear.

59:17.895 --> 59:22.559
The times have been, that, when the brains were out,
the man would die,

59:23.695 --> 59:26.597
and there an end; but now they rise again,

59:26.793 --> 59:33.770
with twenty mortal murders on their crowns,
and push us from our stools.

59:34.828 --> 59:39.375
This is more strange than such a murder is.

59:42.354 --> 59:47.608
You make me strange even to the disposition that I owe,

59:49.724 --> 59:55.408
when now I think you can behold such sights,

59:56.544 --> 01:00:04.032
and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,
when mine is blanched with fear.

01:00:04.306 --> 01:00:05.404
What sights, my lord?

01:00:06.305 --> 01:00:10.735
I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse.

01:00:11.323 --> 01:00:14.969
Question enrages him. At once, good night.

01:00:18.536 --> 01:00:24.337
Stand not upon the order of your going, but go at once.

01:00:25.043 --> 01:00:27.316
Good night; and better health attend his majesty!

01:00:27.356 --> 01:00:30.256
A kind good night to all!

01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:54.050
It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood.

01:00:57.147 --> 01:01:02.556
Stones have been known to move and trees to speak.

01:01:04.516 --> 01:01:10.945
Augurs and understood relations have by magot-pies and choughs and rooks

01:01:11.847 --> 01:01:15.374
brought forth the secret'st man of blood.

01:01:18.706 --> 01:01:19.843
What is the night?

01:01:20.353 --> 01:01:24.861
Almost at odds with morning, which is which.

01:01:25.331 --> 01:01:30.427
How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person at our great bidding?

01:01:31.682 --> 01:01:33.563
Did you send to him, sir?

01:01:34.072 --> 01:01:39.717
I hear it by the way; but I will send.

01:01:41.834 --> 01:01:46.146
There's not a one of them but in his house I keep a servant fee'd.

01:02:05.079 --> 01:02:06.961
More shall they speak;

01:02:11.037 --> 01:02:19.309
for now I am bent to know, by the worst means, the worst.

01:02:21.818 --> 01:02:28.913
How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:31.813
I conjure you, by that which you profess.

01:02:32.362 --> 01:02:34.988
Howe'er you come to know it, answer me.

01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:39.653
Though you untie the winds and let them fight against the churches;

01:02:40.515 --> 01:02:45.533
Though the yesty waves confound and swallow navigation up;

01:02:45.729 --> 01:02:50.511
Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down;

01:02:50.982 --> 01:02:54.352
Though castles topple on their warders' heads;

01:02:55.019 --> 01:02:59.566
Though palaces and pyramids do slope their heads to their foundations;

01:03:00.389 --> 01:03:06.544
Though the treasure of nature's germens tumble all together,

01:03:07.249 --> 01:03:10.973
even till destruction sicken;

01:03:12.306 --> 01:03:13.834
Answer me!

01:03:18.852 --> 01:03:21.578
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!

01:03:21.602 --> 01:03:23.384
beware Macduff;

01:03:23.948 --> 01:03:27.163
Macduff, beware Macduff!

01:03:27.437 --> 01:03:28.613
He's fled to England.

01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:33.630
But I'll reach him still; give to the edge o' the sword his wife, his babes,

01:03:33.669 --> 01:03:36.061
and all unfortunate souls that trace him in his line.

01:03:37.981 --> 01:03:41.548
No boasting like a fool; This deed I'll do
before this purpose cool.

01:03:41.705 --> 01:03:52.289
Macbeth! be bloody, bold, and resolute;
laugh to scorn the power of man;

01:03:52.877 --> 01:04:00.874
for none of woman born shall harm Macbeth.

01:04:01.972 --> 01:04:15.770
Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until
Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill.

01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:20.238
shall come against him.

01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:21.767
That will never be.

01:04:21.767 --> 01:04:26.275
Who can impress the forest, bid the tree unfix his earth-bound root?

01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:29.763
Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee?

01:04:29.803 --> 01:04:32.899
Beware Macduff! Beware Macduff!

01:04:32.899 --> 01:04:38.035
But yet I'll make assurance double sure,
and take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live.

01:04:38.035 --> 01:04:41.954
That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies, and sleep in spite of thunder.

01:04:41.954 --> 01:04:49.442
Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be til Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.

01:04:49.795 --> 01:04:51.519
Sweet bodements! good!

01:04:51.872 --> 01:04:54.734
Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood of Birnam rise,

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:59.084
and our high-placed Macbeth shall live the lease of nature,

01:04:59.084 --> 01:05:03.593
pay his breath to time and mortal custom.

01:05:07.591 --> 01:05:11.237
What, is it so?

01:05:12.451 --> 01:05:16.803
Ay, sir, all this is so.

01:05:45.693 --> 01:05:50.358
Your father's dead, my child; And what will you do now?

01:05:51.063 --> 01:05:54.081
My father is not dead, for all your saying.

01:05:54.081 --> 01:05:59.020
Yes, he is dead; how wilt thou do for a father?

01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:01.843
Nay, how will you do for a husband?

01:06:04.155 --> 01:06:06.155
Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.

01:06:06.429 --> 01:06:08.311
Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.

01:06:10.662 --> 01:06:14.583
Thou speak'st with all thy wit: and yet, i' faith,
with wit enough for thee.

01:06:14.857 --> 01:06:16.543
Was my father a traitor, mother?

01:06:22.305 --> 01:06:23.285
Ay, that he was.

01:06:23.324 --> 01:06:24.461
What is a traitor?

01:06:25.048 --> 01:06:29.949
Why, one that swears and lies.

01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:32.066
And be all traitors that do so?

01:06:33.986 --> 01:06:37.906
Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged.

01:06:37.906 --> 01:06:41.081
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?

01:06:41.904 --> 01:06:44.178
Every one.
/Who must hang them?

01:06:44.570 --> 01:06:46.961
Why, the honest men.

01:06:47.236 --> 01:06:49.979
Then the liars and swearers are fools,

01:06:49.979 --> 01:06:54.997
for there are liars and swearers enow to beat
the honest men and hang up them.

01:06:56.721 --> 01:06:58.524
Now, God help thee, poor monkey!

01:06:59.426 --> 01:07:01.033
How wilt thou do for a father?

01:07:01.464 --> 01:07:03.620
If he were dead, you'ld weep for him;

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:07.893
if you would not, it were a good sign
that I should quickly have a new father.

01:07:08.128 --> 01:07:10.324
Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!

01:07:11.304 --> 01:07:15.341
Bless you, fair dame!

01:07:15.341 --> 01:07:17.220
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly.

01:07:17.244 --> 01:07:19.246
Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.

01:07:20.163 --> 01:07:22.201
To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage;

01:07:22.201 --> 01:07:26.591
To do worse to you were fell cruelty, which is too nigh your person.

01:07:26.631 --> 01:07:27.689
Heaven preserve you!

01:07:27.728 --> 01:07:28.904
Whither should I fly?

01:07:28.904 --> 01:07:30.080
I must abide no longer.

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:35.059
I have done no harm.

01:07:39.331 --> 01:07:40.232
Where is your husband?

01:07:41.212 --> 01:07:44.114
I hope, in no place so unsanctified where such as thou mayst find him.

01:07:44.153 --> 01:07:44.937
He's a traitor.

01:07:44.937 --> 01:07:45.799
Thou liest!

01:07:55.755 --> 01:07:57.480
He has kill'd me, mother!

01:08:11.592 --> 01:08:19.353
Nought's had, all's spent, where our desire is got without content.

01:08:19.393 --> 01:08:25.978
I am in blood stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:33.505
Returning were as tedious as go o'er:

01:08:33.622 --> 01:08:49.812
'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.

01:09:11.058 --> 01:09:13.410
Each new morn, new widows howl,

01:09:14.624 --> 01:09:19.171
new orphans cry, new sorrows strike heaven on the face,

01:09:19.171 --> 01:09:24.228
that it resounds as if it felt with Scotland
and yell'd out like syllable of dolour.

01:09:24.424 --> 01:09:27.835
I am not treacherous, but Macbeth is.

01:09:27.835 --> 01:09:30.343
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke.

01:09:31.872 --> 01:09:39.477
It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash is added to her wounds.

01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:43.671
I think withal there would be hands uplifted in my right;

01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:47.670
And here from gracious England have I offer of goodly thousands.

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:49.080
See who comes here.

01:09:51.158 --> 01:09:53.785
Good God, betimes remove the means that makes us strangers!

01:09:54.098 --> 01:09:55.861
Sirs, amen.

01:09:57.116 --> 01:09:58.566
Stands Scotland where it did?

01:09:58.605 --> 01:10:03.074
Alas, poor country! Almost afraid to know itself.

01:10:03.858 --> 01:10:06.641
It cannot be call'd our mother, but our grave;

01:10:07.347 --> 01:10:11.776
where nothing, but who knows nothing, is once seen to smile.

01:10:12.599 --> 01:10:18.596
where sighs and groans and shrieks
that rend the air are made, not mark'd;

01:10:18.596 --> 01:10:21.851
where violent sorrow seems a modern ecstasy;

01:10:23.027 --> 01:10:26.280
the dead man's knell is there scarce ask'd for who;

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:30.827
and good men's lives expire before the flowers in their caps,

01:10:31.415 --> 01:10:33.375
dying or ere they sicken.

01:10:36.824 --> 01:10:37.491
How does my wife?

01:10:39.255 --> 01:10:40.980
Why, well.

01:10:41.842 --> 01:10:42.587
And all my children?

01:10:44.821 --> 01:10:45.449
Well too.

01:10:47.918 --> 01:10:50.544
The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?

01:10:52.269 --> 01:10:55.091
No; they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.

01:10:55.091 --> 01:10:57.521
But not a niggard of your speech: how goes't?

01:10:59.482 --> 01:11:03.755
Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland would create soldiers,

01:11:03.755 --> 01:11:07.008
make our women fight, to doff their dire distresses.

01:11:07.008 --> 01:11:07.947
Be't their comfort.

01:11:07.972 --> 01:11:09.109
We are coming thither.

01:11:10.026 --> 01:11:13.006
Gracious England hath lent us good Siward and ten thousand men.

01:11:13.006 --> 01:11:15.945
An older and a better soldier none that Christendom gives out.

01:11:19.003 --> 01:11:21.119
Would I could answer this comfort with the like!

01:11:23.197 --> 01:11:26.411
But I have words that would be howl'd out in the desert air,

01:11:26.411 --> 01:11:28.371
where hearing should not latch them.

01:11:28.371 --> 01:11:29.312
What concern they?

01:11:32.487 --> 01:11:33.899
The general cause?

01:11:34.448 --> 01:11:37.074
No mind that's honest but in it shares some woe;

01:11:38.602 --> 01:11:41.856
though the main part pertains to you alone.

01:11:45.149 --> 01:11:47.815
Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,

01:11:49.069 --> 01:11:53.145
that shall possess them with the heaviest sound that ever yet they heard.

01:12:04.318 --> 01:12:05.062
I guess at it.

01:12:05.532 --> 01:12:06.944
Your castle is surprised.
/No!

01:12:06.982 --> 01:12:09.334
Your wife and babes savagely slaughter'd.

01:12:13.097 --> 01:12:20.232
Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak
whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.

01:12:26.896 --> 01:12:27.837
My children too?

01:12:28.973 --> 01:12:31.639
Wife, children, servants, all that could be found.

01:12:33.521 --> 01:12:34.775
And I must be from thence!

01:12:39.557 --> 01:12:42.928
My wife kill'd too?

01:12:45.241 --> 01:12:46.417
Be comforted:

01:12:47.515 --> 01:12:50.886
Let's make us medicines of our great revenge, to cure this deadly grief.

01:12:50.886 --> 01:12:51.944
He has no children.

01:12:55.747 --> 01:12:57.648
All my pretty ones?

01:12:57.673 --> 01:12:59.573
Did you say "all"?

01:13:20.481 --> 01:13:22.324
O hell-kite! All?

01:13:34.632 --> 01:13:40.591
What, all my pretty chickens and their dam at one fell swoop?

01:13:40.943 --> 01:13:42.394
Dispute it like a man.

01:13:42.433 --> 01:13:43.942
I shall do so.

01:13:43.967 --> 01:13:47.630
But I must also feel it as a man.

01:13:48.587 --> 01:13:54.035
I cannot but remember such things were, that were most precious to me.

01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:59.210
Did heaven look on, and would not take their part?

01:13:59.641 --> 01:14:01.680
Be this the whetstone of your sword.

01:14:02.307 --> 01:14:03.717
Let grief convert to anger!

01:14:03.742 --> 01:14:05.443
Blunt not the heart, enrage it!

01:14:05.443 --> 01:14:08.148
O, I could play the woman with mine eyes and braggart with my tongue!

01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:15.047
But, gentle heavens, cut short all intermission;

01:14:16.929 --> 01:14:22.338
front to front bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;

01:14:24.219 --> 01:14:26.258
Within my sword's length set him

01:14:28.963 --> 01:14:33.196
if he 'scape, heaven forgive him too!

01:14:34.607 --> 01:14:36.253
This tune goes manly.

01:14:37.272 --> 01:14:38.370
Come, go we to the king!

01:14:38.762 --> 01:14:42.133
Our power is ready; Our lack is nothing but our leave.

01:14:43.623 --> 01:14:45.740
Macbeth is ripe for shaking,

01:14:46.876 --> 01:14:50.130
and the powers above put on their instruments.

01:14:51.776 --> 01:14:58.205
Receive what cheer you may: the night is long that never finds the day.

01:15:36.189 --> 01:15:37.326
What does the tyrant?

01:15:37.365 --> 01:15:39.795
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.

01:15:39.795 --> 01:15:40.932
Some say he's mad.

01:15:40.932 --> 01:15:43.833
Others that lesser hate him Do call it valiant fury.

01:15:44.029 --> 01:15:48.341
but, for certain, he cannot buckle his
distemper'd cause within the belt of rule.

01:15:48.850 --> 01:15:52.535
Now does he feel his secret murders sticking on his hands;

01:15:53.358 --> 01:15:57.591
Those he commands move only in command, nothing in love.

01:15:57.906 --> 01:16:06.216
Now does he feel his title hang loose about him,
like a giant's robe upon a dwarfish thief.

01:16:31.186 --> 01:16:32.244
Lord!

01:16:33.146 --> 01:16:37.771
Bring me no more reports; let them fly all.

01:16:38.045 --> 01:16:43.690
Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,
I cannot taint with fear.

01:16:44.278 --> 01:16:45.650
What's the boy Malcolm?

01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:48.982
Was he not born of woman?

01:16:51.334 --> 01:16:57.567
The spirits that know all mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:

01:16:58.781 --> 01:17:07.798
'Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of
woman shall e'er have power upon thee.'

01:17:09.679 --> 01:17:17.088
Then fly, false thanes, and mingle with the English epicures:

01:17:17.833 --> 01:17:23.164
The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!

01:17:25.477 --> 01:17:27.123
Where got'st thou that goose look?

01:17:27.123 --> 01:17:30.337
There is ten thousand--/Geese, villain!/
--soldiers, sir.

01:17:31.670 --> 01:17:34.766
Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear, thou lily-liver'd boy.

01:17:34.766 --> 01:17:37.001
What soldiers, patch?

01:17:37.001 --> 01:17:37.757
Death of thy soul!

01:17:37.781 --> 01:17:39.981
Those linen cheeks of thine are counsellors to fear.

01:17:39.981 --> 01:17:41.901
What soldiers, whey-face?

01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:43.861
The English force, so please you.

01:17:47.663 --> 01:17:49.937
Take thy face hence.

01:17:52.328 --> 01:17:57.581
Seyton! I am sick at heart, when I behold.

01:18:02.127 --> 01:18:03.147
Seyton, I say!

01:18:06.165 --> 01:18:14.358
This push will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.

01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:23.061
I have lived long enough.

01:18:23.766 --> 01:18:29.058
My way of life is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf;

01:18:31.331 --> 01:18:37.603
And that which should accompany old age,
as honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,

01:18:38.818 --> 01:18:40.347
I must not look to have.

01:18:42.542 --> 01:18:54.262
but, in their stead, curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,

01:18:55.439 --> 01:19:01.006
which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not.

01:19:02.573 --> 01:19:04.023
Seyton!

01:19:04.650 --> 01:19:06.022
What is your gracious pleasure?

01:19:07.081 --> 01:19:07.786
What news more?

01:19:08.492 --> 01:19:11.864
All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported.

01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:15.077
Give me mine armour.

01:19:17.194 --> 01:19:18.802
Send out more horses.

01:19:20.369 --> 01:19:21.859
Skirr the country round.

01:19:23.271 --> 01:19:25.152
Hang those that talk of fear.

01:19:26.641 --> 01:19:28.014
Give me mine armour.

01:19:30.914 --> 01:19:32.953
How does your patient, doctor?

01:19:34.246 --> 01:19:39.421
Not so sick, my lord, as she is troubled with thick coming fancies,

01:19:40.008 --> 01:19:41.811
that keep her from her rest.

01:19:43.262 --> 01:19:44.477
Cure her of that.

01:19:47.574 --> 01:19:52.788
Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,

01:19:54.669 --> 01:19:56.904
pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,

01:19:58.275 --> 01:20:01.137
raze out the written troubles of the brain,

01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:11.681
and with some sweet oblivious antidote
cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff,

01:20:13.798 --> 01:20:15.366
which weighs upon the heart?

01:20:16.386 --> 01:20:20.188
Therein the patient must minister to himself.

01:20:24.461 --> 01:20:28.184
Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.

01:20:30.458 --> 01:20:37.631
Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff.

01:20:39.631 --> 01:20:42.648
Seyton, send out.

01:20:44.923 --> 01:20:50.371
Doctor, the thanes fly from me.

01:20:52.252 --> 01:20:53.468
Come, sir, dispatch.

01:20:56.408 --> 01:21:04.639
If thou couldst, doctor, cast the water of my land, find her disease,

01:21:04.757 --> 01:21:07.579
and purge it to a sound and pristine health,

01:21:08.128 --> 01:21:12.637
I would applaud thee to the very echo that should applaud again.

01:21:12.637 --> 01:21:14.596
Pull't off, I say.

01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:21.495
What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug,
would scour these English hence?

01:21:29.374 --> 01:21:38.586
I will not be afraid of death and bane,
till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.

01:21:59.675 --> 01:22:01.400
What wood is this before us?

01:22:02.184 --> 01:22:03.203
The wood of Birnam.

01:22:05.673 --> 01:22:10.612
Let every soldier hew him down a bough

01:22:11.318 --> 01:22:13.277
And bear't before him.

01:22:14.767 --> 01:22:18.139
Thereby shall we shadow

01:22:18.609 --> 01:22:26.135
The numbers of our host and make discovery err in report of us.

01:22:26.370 --> 01:22:27.311
It shall be done.

01:23:22.150 --> 01:23:27.011
I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive no truth in your report.

01:23:27.011 --> 01:23:32.813
Doctor, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon her,

01:23:32.813 --> 01:23:39.869
unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,
write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it,

01:23:39.908 --> 01:23:46.297
and again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.

01:23:46.337 --> 01:23:50.256
what, at any time, have you heard her say?

01:23:50.296 --> 01:23:52.843
That, doctor, which I will not report after her.

01:23:52.883 --> 01:23:55.979
You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.

01:23:55.979 --> 01:23:58.459
Lo you, here she comes!

01:23:58.483 --> 01:24:02.040
And, upon my life, fast asleep.

01:24:06.406 --> 01:24:07.582
How came she by that light?

01:24:07.582 --> 01:24:10.091
She has light by her continually; 'tis her command.

01:24:17.226 --> 01:24:19.671
You see, her eyes are open.

01:24:19.695 --> 01:24:22.502
/Ay, but their sense is shut.

01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:34.160
Yet here's a spot.

01:24:37.648 --> 01:24:40.039
Look, how she rubs her hands.

01:24:40.039 --> 01:24:47.252
It is an accustomed action with her,
to seem thus washing her hands.

01:24:47.291 --> 01:24:53.720
Out, damned spot! out, I say!

01:24:58.777 --> 01:25:06.107
One: two: why, then, 'tis time to do't.

01:25:09.713 --> 01:25:12.849
Hell is murky!

01:25:17.827 --> 01:25:21.433
Fie, my lord, fie!

01:25:23.119 --> 01:25:24.217
Do you mark that?

01:25:25.236 --> 01:25:32.213
Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him.

01:25:36.211 --> 01:25:49.578
The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?

01:25:52.048 --> 01:25:57.574
What, will these hands ne'er be clean?

01:25:59.849 --> 01:26:03.493
No more o' that, my lord, no more o'that, you mar all with this starting.

01:26:04.669 --> 01:26:08.785
Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.

01:26:09.099 --> 01:26:12.078
She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that.

01:26:15.527 --> 01:26:18.663
Here's the smell of the blood still.

01:26:21.486 --> 01:26:33.206
All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.

01:26:49.043 --> 01:26:52.375
The heart is sorely charged.

01:26:52.414 --> 01:26:58.569
I would not have such a heart in my bosom
for the dignity of the whole body.

01:27:00.450 --> 01:27:03.900
Wash your hands, put on your nightgown;

01:27:05.076 --> 01:27:06.839
Look not so pale.

01:27:08.015 --> 01:27:15.895
I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he cannot come out on's grave.

01:27:22.128 --> 01:27:24.597
There's knocking at the gate:

01:27:34.122 --> 01:27:37.885
To bed, to bed!

01:27:39.414 --> 01:27:47.607
Come, come, come, come, give me your hand.

01:27:50.155 --> 01:27:54.231
What's done cannot be undone.

01:27:57.290 --> 01:28:01.640
To bed, to bed!

01:28:28.884 --> 01:28:30.060
God forgive us all!

01:30:14.173 --> 01:30:15.192
What is that noise?

01:30:15.623 --> 01:30:17.779
It is the cry of women, my good lord.

01:30:18.563 --> 01:30:21.033
I have almost forgot the taste of fears;

01:30:22.915 --> 01:30:28.206
The time has been, my senses would have cool'd to hear a night-shriek.

01:30:29.735 --> 01:30:36.281
and my fell of hair would at a dismal
treatise rouse and stir as life were in't.

01:30:37.535 --> 01:30:43.024
I have supp'd full with horrors.

01:30:43.807 --> 01:30:51.255
Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts cannot once start me.

01:30:53.294 --> 01:30:54.588
Wherefore was that cry?

01:30:54.588 --> 01:30:57.645
The queen, my lord, is dead.

01:31:07.679 --> 01:31:09.405
She should have died hereafter.

01:31:09.875 --> 01:31:12.344
There would have been a time for such a word.

01:31:16.931 --> 01:31:32.610
To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
creeps in this petty pace from day to day

01:31:32.650 --> 01:31:36.648
to the last syllable of recorded time,

01:31:38.177 --> 01:31:45.115
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death.

01:31:46.370 --> 01:31:56.404
Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow,

01:31:56.522 --> 01:32:01.893
a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage

01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:05.225
then is heard no more.

01:32:06.322 --> 01:32:16.396
It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.

01:32:19.924 --> 01:32:21.375
Gracious my lord!

01:32:24.706 --> 01:32:30.273
I should report that which I say I saw, but know not how to do it.

01:32:31.331 --> 01:32:35.055
Well, say, sir.

01:32:36.113 --> 01:32:43.522
As I did stand my watch upon the hill,
I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,

01:32:43.561 --> 01:32:46.501
the wood began to move.

01:32:48.775 --> 01:32:53.909
If thou speak'st false, upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,

01:32:53.909 --> 01:32:55.242
till famine cling thee.

01:32:57.398 --> 01:33:03.004
if thy speech be sooth, I care not if thou dost for me as much.

01:33:06.649 --> 01:33:16.371
I pull in resolution, and begin to doubt
the equivocation of the fiend that lies like truth.

01:33:19.154 --> 01:33:21.898
'Fear not, till Birnam wood do come to Dunsinane;'

01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:29.738
and now a wood comes toward Dunsinane.

01:33:33.070 --> 01:33:34.705
Arm, arm, and out!

01:33:34.729 --> 01:33:38.816
There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.

01:33:38.989 --> 01:33:42.047
I gin to be aweary of the sun,

01:33:42.634 --> 01:33:47.064
and wish the estate o' the world were now undone.

01:33:47.887 --> 01:33:49.337
Ring the alarum-bell!

01:33:57.099 --> 01:33:57.765
Seyton!

01:34:10.348 --> 01:34:13.131
Blow, wind! come, wrack!

01:34:13.954 --> 01:34:17.522
At least we'll die with harness on our back.

01:34:56.055 --> 01:35:00.837
I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms are hired to bear their staves

01:35:03.189 --> 01:35:08.246
Either thou, Macbeth, or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge

01:35:08.246 --> 01:35:09.892
I sheathe again undeeded.

01:35:09.931 --> 01:35:15.458
Our castle's strength will laugh a siege to scorn.

01:35:17.419 --> 01:35:22.083
Here let you lie till famine and the ague eat you up.

01:35:23.063 --> 01:35:26.787
Were you not forced with those that should be ours,

01:35:27.454 --> 01:35:33.803
We might have met you dareful, beard to beard, and beat you backward home.

01:36:06.026 --> 01:36:08.299
This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd.

01:36:08.886 --> 01:36:11.082
We have met with foes that strike beside us.

01:36:11.121 --> 01:36:13.670
What's he that was not born of woman?

01:36:15.158 --> 01:36:18.413
Such a one am I to fear, or none.

01:36:18.413 --> 01:36:19.941
Poor a child(?)

01:36:24.096 --> 01:36:30.525
Thou wast born of woman; but swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,

01:36:31.191 --> 01:36:33.936
Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.

01:36:34.327 --> 01:36:38.090
Tyrant, show thy face!

01:36:38.482 --> 01:36:41.971
If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,

01:36:41.971 --> 01:36:45.028
my wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.

01:36:45.303 --> 01:36:47.969
Turn, hell-hound, turn!

01:36:50.203 --> 01:36:54.632
Of all men else I have avoided thee; but get thee back.

01:36:56.082 --> 01:37:00.434
My soul is too much charged with blood of thine already.

01:37:00.630 --> 01:37:04.589
I have no words; my voice is in my sword.

01:37:17.250 --> 01:37:22.033
I bear a charmed life, which must not yield, to one of woman born.

01:37:22.072 --> 01:37:24.032
Despair thy charm.

01:37:25.404 --> 01:37:30.304
And let the angel whom thou still hast served tell thee,

01:37:30.304 --> 01:37:35.949
Macduff was from his mother's womb untimely ripp'd.

01:37:36.105 --> 01:37:38.026
Untimely ripp'd!

01:37:38.183 --> 01:37:40.104
Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,

01:37:40.104 --> 01:37:43.592
and be these juggling fiends no more believed,

01:37:44.768 --> 01:37:47.003
that palter with us in a double sense;

01:37:48.453 --> 01:37:52.255
that keep the word of promise to our ear, and break it to our hope.

01:37:53.353 --> 01:37:54.764
I'll not fight with thee.

01:37:55.626 --> 01:38:02.643
Then yield thee, coward, and live to be the show and gaze o' the time.

01:38:03.036 --> 01:38:09.268
We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are, painted on a pole, and underwrit,

01:38:09.856 --> 01:38:12.795
'Here may you see the tyrant.'

01:38:13.227 --> 01:38:20.087
I will not yield, to kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,

01:38:21.616 --> 01:38:24.399
and to be baited with the rabble's curse.

01:38:27.182 --> 01:38:31.690
Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,

01:38:32.827 --> 01:38:37.256
and thou opposed, being of no woman born,

01:38:38.628 --> 01:38:40.549
Yet I will try the last.

01:38:43.332 --> 01:38:44.782
Lay on, Macduff.

01:38:46.233 --> 01:38:51.486
And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'

01:39:15.671 --> 01:39:19.356
Hail, king! for so thou art.

01:39:20.023 --> 01:39:23.825
Behold, where stands the usurper's cursed head.

01:39:24.335 --> 01:39:25.902
The time is free.

01:39:26.334 --> 01:39:30.724
Hail, Malcolm, king of Scotland!

01:39:30.724 --> 01:39:49.304
Hail!

01:40:15.685 --> 01:40:17.057
Peace!

01:40:18.233 --> 01:40:20.272
The charm's wound up.
