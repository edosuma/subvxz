WEBVTT

01:49.609 --> 01:50.692
Yeah.

01:50.860 --> 01:57.032
Yeah, his hair was long.
Filthy, gray-on-gray, long hair.

02:10.213 --> 02:14.716
I saw him, at the foot of Laura's bed.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.010
He looked like an animal.

02:17.554 --> 02:20.973
- Had you ever seen this man before?
- No, never.

02:21.766 --> 02:24.893
His face. My God, his face.

02:25.061 --> 02:29.064
Sarah, did you tell them
about the necklace?

02:29.232 --> 02:32.067
- You're gonna love that one.
- What necklace?

02:33.153 --> 02:36.155
She's had two visions.

02:36.614 --> 02:38.699
Go ahead, Sarah.

02:39.450 --> 02:42.703
Leland.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.455
Sarah.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.418
It's night.

02:51.004 --> 02:54.506
A flashlight beam
moves across the ground.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.467
Then a hand,

02:58.094 --> 03:00.804
a gloved hand,

03:01.139 --> 03:06.018
lifts a rock
and takes out a necklace.

03:06.644 --> 03:08.896
Broken in half.

03:09.772 --> 03:11.815
It was Laura's.

03:13.234 --> 03:16.320
Invitation to Love.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.786
Don't fight it, Chet.

03:24.954 --> 03:28.582
You know as well as I
there's still something between us.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.376
There always will be.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.629
For God's sake, Emerald.

03:33.796 --> 03:37.883
That may be true,
but I'm married to your sister now.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.176
It's wrong.

03:39.344 --> 03:42.512
Well, you always said
you could never tell us apart, so...

03:43.097 --> 03:44.806
Morning, Lucy. What's going on?

03:44.974 --> 03:48.435
Uh, thanks to Jade,
Jared decided not to kill himself.

03:48.603 --> 03:51.647
And he's changed his will, leaving the
Towers to Jade instead of Emerald,

03:51.814 --> 03:54.524
but Emerald found out about it,
and now she's trying to seduce Chet

03:54.692 --> 03:57.069
to give her the new will
so that she can destroy it.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.987
Montana's planning
to kill Jared at midnight,

03:59.155 --> 04:01.782
so the Towers will belong
to Emerald and Montana,

04:01.950 --> 04:05.702
but I think she's going to double-cross
him and he doesn't know it yet.

04:05.870 --> 04:07.162
Poor Chet.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.706
What's going on here?

04:09.874 --> 04:13.293
Uh, Agent Cooper's in
the conference room with Dr. Jacoby.

04:13.461 --> 04:14.962
Thank you.

04:15.922 --> 04:19.800
Lucy, why couldn't I spend the night
last night?

04:20.301 --> 04:23.345
Will you be having coffee,
Deputy Brennan?

04:38.361 --> 04:41.571
Was Laura Palmer seeing you
because she was addicted to cocaine?

04:42.490 --> 04:48.078
Agent Cooper, I'd like to help you,
but, uh, I got a little problem here.

04:48.246 --> 04:51.081
Look, maybe there's some
sort of hula we can do

04:51.249 --> 04:55.043
around my doctor-patient
confidentiality, huh?

04:55.253 --> 04:58.463
It is safe to say she came to you
because she was having problems?

04:59.090 --> 05:00.674
Oh, my, yes.

05:00.842 --> 05:03.135
Were her problems
of a sexual nature?

05:03.303 --> 05:04.928
Agent Cooper,

05:05.722 --> 05:09.766
the problems of our entire society
are of a sexual nature.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.106
Tibet. Hm.

05:16.274 --> 05:19.401
You know, my abiding interests
lie to the east as well,

05:19.569 --> 05:22.237
but only as far as, uh, Hawaii.

05:22.989 --> 05:28.327
Ancient Hawaiians often turned to the
soothing rhizome of the ginger plant

05:28.494 --> 05:30.495
to ease the pain
of profound confusion.

05:30.663 --> 05:34.499
Which, more often than not,
was sexual.

05:35.043 --> 05:38.295
Ginger is nonaddictive. Cocaine is.

05:38.463 --> 05:42.090
Look, the fact that Laura Palmer
sought medication,

05:42.258 --> 05:45.844
no matter how dubious,
was actually a positive sign.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.264
Dr. Jacoby, I understand
you cared deeply for Laura Palmer.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.141
Why is it that you won't help us?

05:52.435 --> 05:57.731
My own personal investigation,
I suspect,

05:58.024 --> 06:01.443
will be ongoing for the rest of my life.

06:02.528 --> 06:07.240
Laura had secrets.

06:07.408 --> 06:12.662
And around those secrets,
she built a fortress that...

06:12.830 --> 06:17.250
Well, that in my six months
with her I was not able to penetrate,

06:17.418 --> 06:21.338
and for which I consider myself
an abject failure.

06:21.506 --> 06:25.175
Doctor, did Laura ever discuss
Bobby Briggs

06:25.343 --> 06:27.594
or James Hurley with you?

06:27.762 --> 06:30.722
Yeah, they were boys.
Laura was a woman.

06:30.890 --> 06:34.309
She had sex with three men
the night she was murdered.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.853
- Were you one of them?
- Heh.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.106
No.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.691
Who killed her, Dr. Jacoby?

06:41.859 --> 06:44.277
The night after Laura died,

06:44.445 --> 06:49.199
I followed a man that, uh,
Laura had spoken to me about.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.952
He was driving a red Corvette.

06:52.120 --> 06:56.248
I followed him to the Old Sawmill Road
and then I lost him.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.583
And that, gentlemen,
is all I can tell you.

06:59.961 --> 07:01.044
Agent Cooper,

07:01.212 --> 07:02.421
there's a Gordon Cole on the phone.

07:02.588 --> 07:05.132
He says you're expecting his call.
Should I put him through?

07:05.299 --> 07:07.467
Yes, Lucy, put him through.

07:07.635 --> 07:09.344
Thank you, doctor. That will be all.

07:12.181 --> 07:14.141
You'll be in town, doctor?

07:14.308 --> 07:18.311
Well, I'm planning a pilgrimage
to Pebble Beach,

07:18.479 --> 07:21.314
but that's not till
the end of the month.

07:21.607 --> 07:24.025
Hang loose, haoles.

07:24.193 --> 07:25.902
Does Leo Johnson
drive a red Corvette?

07:26.070 --> 07:27.237
Yes.

07:27.405 --> 07:30.824
- How we doing on Jacques Renault?
- There's an APB on him.

07:30.992 --> 07:34.786
His brother made bail this morning.
I got an all-points on him too.

07:35.329 --> 07:37.581
Harry, this is my supervisor.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.293
Good morning, Gordon.
How are we doing?

07:41.461 --> 07:42.794
Cooper, where do we start?

07:42.962 --> 07:47.007
The Palmer girl or Albert's
new best friend, Harry Truman?

07:47.175 --> 07:49.968
- Laura Palmer.
- Albert has been very busy.

07:50.136 --> 07:53.847
The twine he found on her upper arms
is a common household variety.

07:54.015 --> 07:55.640
Finley's Fine Twine.

07:55.808 --> 07:59.895
- And the twine on her wrists?
- Definitely not a match. No ID yet.

08:00.062 --> 08:01.521
And those marks on her shoulders?

08:01.689 --> 08:03.732
- Bird bites.
- Bird bites?

08:03.900 --> 08:05.650
He'll also be faxing a reconstruction

08:05.818 --> 08:07.903
of the plastic fragment
from her stomach.

08:08.070 --> 08:10.530
Great, tell Albert
we're anxiously awaiting his results.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.324
Now for the bad news, Coop.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.452
I've got an O.O.J. and an A.F.O. here
from Albert

08:15.620 --> 08:18.205
concerning his mano a mano
with the local Sheriff Truman.

08:18.372 --> 08:20.457
Albert wants this guy's badge, Coop.

08:20.625 --> 08:24.628
Gordon, here's how it is.
You know Albert.

08:24.795 --> 08:27.255
In my opinion, Sheriff Truman
displayed the patience of a saint

08:27.423 --> 08:29.174
not clocking him
a day earlier than he did.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.009
He wants it filed
with the U.S. attorney.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.345
- File it under F for "forget it."
- Cooper.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.889
- Tell Albert if he wants to pursue this...
- Coop.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.016
- I'll fight him
all the way to Washington.

08:38.184 --> 08:41.770
- Don't get excited and hang up, now.
- I'll talk to you later, Gordon.

08:42.813 --> 08:47.025
Thanks. Uh, I didn't get
a whole lot of sleep last night.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.611
Harry, the last thing I want you
to worry about while I'm here

08:49.779 --> 08:53.740
is some city slicker I brought into
your town relieving himself upstream.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.162
- This is the man I saw in my dream.
- You saw this man?

08:59.330 --> 09:03.333
I had an intuition that my dream and
Sarah Palmer's vision were connected.

09:03.501 --> 09:06.294
I didn't go with you this morning
because I didn't wanna influence her.

09:06.462 --> 09:09.714
I'm a strong sender.
The eyes were a bit closer together.

09:09.882 --> 09:13.218
Deputy
Hawk calling in for Agent Cooper.

09:15.429 --> 09:17.013
Hawk.

09:17.306 --> 09:19.474
Right. Stay there.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.935
Follow him if he moves.

09:22.478 --> 09:24.604
Traveling east on Highway 12,
how long will it take us

09:24.772 --> 09:26.273
to reach the Timber Falls Motel?

09:26.440 --> 09:27.482
- Half an hour.
- Ten minutes.

09:27.650 --> 09:31.820
- Depends how you go.
- Hawk's found our one-armed man.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.874
I wish I could have seen
Josie's face.

09:45.042 --> 09:47.168
Opening the safe
for her lawman Romeo

09:47.336 --> 09:49.838
to show him the double set of books,

09:50.006 --> 09:53.842
and all she finds
is the one I've been slowly cooking.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.386
Where's the book
that spells bankruptcy?

09:56.554 --> 09:58.847
Mm, I have more than one
hiding place.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.557
Life goes on, trust me.

10:00.725 --> 10:02.684
My desk upstairs.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.272
There's a drop panel
in the top drawer.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.026
Not even Pete the poodle
knows about that one.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.238
I'm famished.

10:15.406 --> 10:17.282
Let's get one thing straight.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.492
I didn't spend 18 months
up the Amazon

10:19.660 --> 10:21.620
dodging blow darts for my health.

10:21.787 --> 10:28.418
I suppose room service is too much to
expect of this rusticated mildew farm.

10:28.586 --> 10:33.298
You would prefer the Lumber Baron
Suite at the Great Northern?

10:33.507 --> 10:37.135
I'd prefer getting on with setting
the torch to that damn mill.

10:43.601 --> 10:47.771
Harry, he's here at the motel.
Room 101.

10:47.938 --> 10:49.397
Last name's Gerard.

10:49.857 --> 10:55.362
Now, when the mill goes up in smoke,
the headline that we're after is:

10:55.529 --> 11:00.116
"Josie Packard torches
bankrupt mill in insurance fraud."

11:00.284 --> 11:03.662
Not "Giant weenie roast
in the woods."

11:03.829 --> 11:05.830
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
- Hm? Hm?

11:15.466 --> 11:18.927
Mr. Gerard, it's the police. Open up.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.264
What...? Jeez...

11:25.935 --> 11:29.062
Gunplay? Sounds serious.

11:31.565 --> 11:33.775
Mr. Gerard.

11:35.903 --> 11:37.779
- Don't move.
- Oh, my God.

11:37.947 --> 11:40.281
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

11:49.208 --> 11:52.711
You, uh, let me know
if there's any bloodshed.

11:52.878 --> 11:57.298
I'm going to give little Elvis a bath.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.237
What do you mean, you don't
know him? You know this man.

12:19.405 --> 12:22.157
Oh, no, sir. I've never seen
that man before in my life.

12:23.242 --> 12:26.453
But you know something, he kind of
looks like somebody, doesn't he?

12:26.620 --> 12:28.830
Mr. Gerard,
do you have a friend named Bob?

12:28.998 --> 12:31.332
Bob Lydecker's just about
my best friend in the world.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.752
Why have you been
at the hospital the past two days?

12:33.919 --> 12:34.961
Bob's in a coma.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.756
There was a Lydecker
assaulted three days ago outside a bar

12:37.923 --> 12:39.591
in Lotown.

12:39.759 --> 12:43.094
- That's Bob.
- Is your friend Bob a doctor?

12:43.262 --> 12:45.889
He's just about the best
darn veterinarian in these parts.

12:46.056 --> 12:47.515
Thanks.

12:48.642 --> 12:51.519
He's clean. No record, no warrants.

12:52.354 --> 12:54.564
Take a look at his car.

12:55.608 --> 12:56.983
Your middle name is Michael.

12:57.151 --> 12:58.443
Named after my uncle.

12:58.611 --> 13:02.030
- How'd you lose the arm?
- Car accident.

13:02.406 --> 13:05.200
I was on the road
from Memphis to, uh...

13:05.367 --> 13:08.495
Someplace. Selling pharmaceuticals.

13:08.662 --> 13:09.746
Pretty good job.

13:13.459 --> 13:16.669
That's what I'm selling these days.
Everybody needs shoes.

13:16.837 --> 13:20.215
- They're all for the right foot.
- That's my sample case.

13:20.382 --> 13:23.259
Yeah. Two-day delivery, guaranteed.

13:23.427 --> 13:26.304
We could certainly take care of
all your departmental needs.

13:26.472 --> 13:29.641
The arm you lost,
did it have a tattoo?

13:29.934 --> 13:32.060
What's this all about?

13:32.645 --> 13:35.313
- I'm a shoe salesman.
- Settle down, Mr. Gerard.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.065
He just asked you a question.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.692
If you won't tell us, we can find out.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.986
What did it say?

13:44.865 --> 13:48.785
It said "Mom."

13:58.087 --> 13:59.212
Harry.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.174
What do you got?

14:03.342 --> 14:05.844
Car was already staked out
when I got here.

14:06.011 --> 14:08.388
It was Josie Packard.

14:24.655 --> 14:27.282
I've been doing some research.

14:29.285 --> 14:32.245
In real life, there is no algebra.

14:32.413 --> 14:35.665
Maybe you should run away
and join the circus.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.459
Escape.

14:39.169 --> 14:40.378
I got a better idea.

14:41.297 --> 14:46.009
A tall, dark and handsome stranger
falls madly in love with me,

14:46.176 --> 14:50.930
takes me away to a life of mystery
and international intrigue.

14:51.098 --> 14:55.143
You mean the FBI agent?
Dream on.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.978
Maybe.

14:58.314 --> 15:01.024
Or maybe he'll realize
that I'm the woman of his dreams

15:01.191 --> 15:03.860
because I'm gonna help him
figure out who killed Laura.

15:04.028 --> 15:06.154
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.489
And you're gonna help me.

15:08.657 --> 15:12.160
Fact: Laura was seeing James Hurley
behind Bobby's back.

15:12.745 --> 15:16.664
- What if she was?
- So it is true.

15:17.374 --> 15:20.501
Fact: Laura had a sweet tooth
for nose candy.

15:20.669 --> 15:22.629
Well, I guess
that's not such a big secret.

15:23.964 --> 15:26.507
I didn't know Laura half as well as you,
and I knew the score.

15:26.675 --> 15:28.259
Laura was wild.

15:28.802 --> 15:31.346
Come on, will you help me?

15:33.223 --> 15:34.849
What else have you figured out,
Sherlock?

15:36.685 --> 15:38.603
The morning of the funeral,

15:38.771 --> 15:42.732
Jacoby's talking to my brother Johnny,
trying to get him to go to the funeral.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.985
So he tells Johnny that Laura's
in a better place now, blah, blah, blah.

15:46.153 --> 15:51.199
And he knows that
because Laura was his patient.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.121
Laura was seeing Jacoby?

15:57.539 --> 15:59.874
It gets better.
You ever heard of One-Eyed Jack's?

16:00.834 --> 16:02.752
Isn't that that Western
with Marlon Brando?

16:03.712 --> 16:07.632
It's a place across the border.
They have girls working there.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.134
Are you saying you think Laura
was one of them?

16:10.302 --> 16:13.554
I don't know. But if it's true,
wouldn't you wanna know about it?

16:13.722 --> 16:15.723
Well, it sure would explain
a few things.

16:17.893 --> 16:20.186
You know, I think about it.

16:20.354 --> 16:23.982
I think about Laura being in a place
like that and I get all shivery.

16:24.149 --> 16:25.566
But it's like a hot cold,

16:25.734 --> 16:28.861
like when you hold an ice cube
on your bare skin for a long time.

16:29.029 --> 16:31.656
Audrey, I'll help you,

16:31.824 --> 16:36.035
but whatever we find out, we have to
promise to keep it between ourselves.

16:36.203 --> 16:37.787
- Our secret.
- It's a deal.

16:37.955 --> 16:39.288
And I know exactly where to start.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.083
Did you know Ronette and Laura
worked in the same place?

16:42.418 --> 16:43.459
No.

16:43.627 --> 16:47.672
The perfume counter
at my father's department store.

17:04.106 --> 17:07.108
I've arranged for you to have a little
chat with Hank before the hearing.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.776
He's glad you're here.

17:08.944 --> 17:11.738
I hope I didn't come on
too strong yesterday.

17:11.905 --> 17:15.408
I'll be sure to tell him how helpful
you've been, Mr. Mooney.

17:38.015 --> 17:40.475
Haven't seen you for a while, Norma.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.769
Been kind of busy.

17:42.936 --> 17:46.606
- So, uh, business is good?
- Yeah.

17:49.860 --> 17:53.071
You gotta back me up in there,
Norma, please.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.530
I gotta get out.

17:54.698 --> 17:56.574
It's starting to put the zap on me,
bigtime.

17:57.659 --> 18:00.369
I know I have no right to ask
and you have no reason to believe me,

18:00.537 --> 18:03.581
but I'll change.

18:06.001 --> 18:09.545
I swear on my life, I have changed.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.509
Give me a chance to prove it to you.

18:15.469 --> 18:17.512
I've replayed it
in my mind a million times,

18:17.679 --> 18:20.181
and I just don't have any answers.

18:20.349 --> 18:22.934
A car in perfect condition
goes out of control.

18:23.102 --> 18:28.022
A vagrant nobody knows is killed
while sleeping by the roadside.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.733
Why?
Why did fate deal me this hand?

18:31.193 --> 18:33.653
You are not incarcerated
for an act of fate, Mr. Jennings.

18:33.862 --> 18:35.530
I accept that.

18:35.697 --> 18:39.659
But it was fate, maybe in an odd way
even luck, that sent me to prison.

18:39.827 --> 18:42.870
- Just as much as the car accident.
- What is your point?

18:43.705 --> 18:46.666
I know I have a lot to make up for.

18:47.501 --> 18:49.836
For the life I destroyed,

18:50.087 --> 18:55.133
and for another life
I very nearly destroyed.

18:55.509 --> 18:59.345
Mrs. Jennings, your husband
would be facing a difficult reentry.

18:59.513 --> 19:01.055
How would you help him?

19:01.223 --> 19:04.392
I own the Double R Diner
in Twin Peaks.

19:04.768 --> 19:06.936
I can give him a job.

19:07.187 --> 19:10.690
The boss is tough but fair.

19:10.858 --> 19:14.360
And you would live together
as man and wife?

19:15.237 --> 19:17.780
Well, he is my husband, isn't he?

19:18.866 --> 19:20.867
Well, we have what we need here.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.370
We'll make our decision
without the inmate present.

19:26.039 --> 19:29.167
We'll let you know by 5:00 today.

19:39.052 --> 19:40.970
Catch you later.

19:58.071 --> 20:02.700
In my dream, Mike said he and Bob
lived above a convenience store.

20:02.868 --> 20:07.496
Cooper, I'd think you'd be afraid
to go to sleep at night.

20:15.797 --> 20:17.465
Hey, Hawk.

20:19.676 --> 20:22.220
Andy, could you go into the One Stop
and get me some twine?

20:22.387 --> 20:23.930
Okay.

20:39.947 --> 20:42.657
No, that's not Dr. Lydecker.

20:42.824 --> 20:46.494
- Does Dr. Lydecker treat birds?
- Why, yes, of course.

20:47.829 --> 20:51.624
- Rhetta, we're ready for you.
- There are other vets in Twin Peaks.

20:51.792 --> 20:54.168
Yes, but only one
has a best friend with one arm.

20:54.336 --> 20:58.631
Harry, in the heat
of the investigative pursuit,

20:58.799 --> 21:02.551
the shortest distance between two
points is not necessarily a straight line.

21:02.719 --> 21:06.847
Andy, hand me that spool
of Finley's Fine Twine.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.518
Ms. Loomer, we're gonna have to
confiscate your files.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.019
What?

21:12.229 --> 21:14.146
Harry, as clear as the signs
on the turnpike,

21:14.314 --> 21:18.276
the bird that attacked Laura Palmer
is a client of this office.

21:34.710 --> 21:36.919
I feel so bad for you.

21:37.671 --> 21:41.257
I was watching you at the funeral
and my heart was aching.

21:41.425 --> 21:44.385
I wanted to hold you so much.

21:46.930 --> 21:49.265
That James Hurley.

21:50.183 --> 21:52.727
He was seeing Laura
behind my back.

21:53.520 --> 21:58.482
- I'm gonna fix him.
- Fix me first.

22:02.321 --> 22:05.698
When is Leo due back?

22:06.742 --> 22:11.620
Don't worry, bad boy.
I can hear his Vette a mile away.

22:13.123 --> 22:17.084
Don't mess around with this, Shelly.
Where is he?

22:18.587 --> 22:21.797
He's with his friend,
that creepy Jacques.

22:24.718 --> 22:27.470
Jacques who?

22:28.388 --> 22:31.015
That Canuck guy
that works at the Roadhouse.

22:31.516 --> 22:34.852
- Leo and Jacques?
- What's the matter?

22:38.648 --> 22:41.233
Gotta think. I gotta think...

22:41.401 --> 22:43.069
Um, well, think later, Bobby.

22:43.236 --> 22:46.072
I have to go back to the diner
in a half an hour.

22:47.324 --> 22:49.492
I gotta tell you something.

22:49.785 --> 22:51.619
What? What is it?

22:51.787 --> 22:54.580
I've been onto this for a while.
I've been checking it out.

22:54.748 --> 22:56.707
- It's pretty bad.
- Tell me.

22:57.793 --> 23:01.253
Leo and Jacques are running drugs
across the border.

23:01.421 --> 23:04.965
Cocaine. And they've been
selling them at school.

23:06.301 --> 23:08.636
I knew it. I knew Leo
was messed up in something.

23:09.137 --> 23:12.431
I think it's even possible
they were giving drugs to Laura.

23:13.058 --> 23:15.559
Bobby,
I have to show you something.

23:21.441 --> 23:25.027
This was in Leo's truck
two days after Laura was murdered.

23:25.487 --> 23:27.822
You sure this is Leo's?

23:29.324 --> 23:31.992
It has his initials sewn in the collar.

23:32.160 --> 23:34.829
He makes me sew them
into everything.

23:35.831 --> 23:38.833
Shelly, this...

23:39.000 --> 23:42.628
This could be the answer
to our prayers.

23:42.796 --> 23:44.422
What do you mean?

23:45.507 --> 23:51.387
You don't need to know.
I'm gonna take this, okay?

23:51.888 --> 23:54.056
You never saw this.

23:54.433 --> 23:58.102
Say it. "I never saw it."

23:58.895 --> 24:00.062
I never saw it.

24:00.689 --> 24:03.441
Leo's not gonna be
a problem for us anymore.

24:03.608 --> 24:06.527
Stay clear of him and keep quiet.

24:12.117 --> 24:16.078
- I bought this.
- You know how to use it?

24:19.291 --> 24:21.667
I thought you could teach me.

24:22.335 --> 24:24.295
Teach me, Bobby.

24:31.595 --> 24:33.554
Fellas, take them
right into the conference room.

24:34.014 --> 24:35.973
Lucy, I need you
to go through these files

24:36.141 --> 24:38.142
and pull out all the people
who own birds.

24:38.810 --> 24:42.897
- How will I know they own birds?
- It'll say so on the cards.

24:44.608 --> 24:47.818
Okay, I'll start going
through the files, then.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.575
Agent Cooper, I'm so sorry.
I don't know what happened.

24:54.743 --> 24:56.744
My gun just slipped out of my hand.

24:56.912 --> 24:59.246
Andy, have you ever used
your weapon in the line of duty?

24:59.581 --> 25:02.166
No, sir, I haven't.
I can't explain what happened.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.126
I've been feeling a little high-strung.

25:04.294 --> 25:07.087
Well, it was lack
of preparation. We'll take care of that.

25:07.255 --> 25:09.131
Andy, get some ammunition
from the lockbox,

25:09.299 --> 25:11.759
meet us downstairs
at the pistol range.

25:18.099 --> 25:21.936
Lucy, did you hear what happened?
I feel so dumb.

25:22.103 --> 25:24.647
I dropped my gun and it went off.

25:24.814 --> 25:27.650
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yeah, I guess so, but...

25:27.817 --> 25:31.153
I would like to chat, but I am now
under orders to examine these files,

25:31.321 --> 25:34.240
so if you'll excuse me, please.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.829
Laura Palmer's murder
was vicious and calculated.

25:40.997 --> 25:43.791
There's no telling what we'll encounter
bringing a suspect to ground.

25:43.959 --> 25:46.544
After Andy's mishap at the motel,
I wanna make absolutely certain

25:46.711 --> 25:48.963
each of us is comfortable
and confident with our firearms.

25:49.130 --> 25:50.172
Nice piece.

25:50.340 --> 25:53.300
Actually, it's standard issue.
I made a few modifications.

25:53.677 --> 25:56.470
How long has Lucy
been upset with Andy?

25:56.763 --> 25:57.805
Body language?

25:57.973 --> 26:00.182
In this case,
it was yelling through a megaphone.

26:00.350 --> 26:03.811
- Six rounds apiece to start with, Andy.
- Okay.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.356
Care to tell us
about you and Lucy, Andy?

26:07.524 --> 26:09.108
Jeez, you can tell?

26:09.484 --> 26:11.318
Not too many secrets
left around here.

26:12.362 --> 26:15.322
She won't speak to me,
and I don't know why.

26:15.490 --> 26:17.950
And I don't know why she's doing
what she's doing.

26:18.285 --> 26:20.286
I just can't figure her out.

26:20.453 --> 26:23.372
Well, there's no logic at work here,
Andy. Let that one go.

26:23.540 --> 26:24.582
In the grand design,

26:24.749 --> 26:27.126
women were drawn
from a different set of blueprints.

26:27.294 --> 26:29.670
- Amen to that.
- Amen.

26:29.838 --> 26:32.006
Hawk, Andy.

26:34.384 --> 26:36.468
Rapid fire.

26:51.067 --> 26:54.236
Hawk. Six for six, two kills.
High marks.

26:54.404 --> 26:56.238
Andy.

26:57.240 --> 26:59.199
Andy, what we need is practice
and lots of it.

27:00.535 --> 27:03.454
One hour, three times a week.
Harry, you'll supply the ordnance?

27:03.622 --> 27:05.664
Whatever it takes.

27:06.041 --> 27:07.875
Chin up, Andy.

27:10.211 --> 27:12.630
- You ever been married, Cooper?
- No.

27:13.423 --> 27:17.843
I knew someone once who
helped me understand commitment,

27:18.011 --> 27:20.971
the responsibilities and the risks.

27:22.891 --> 27:25.643
Who taught me the pain
of a broken heart.

27:40.742 --> 27:42.951
One woman
can make you fly like an eagle,

27:43.286 --> 27:46.246
another can give you the strength
of a lion.

27:46.414 --> 27:50.417
But only one in the cycle of life
can fill your heart with wonder

27:50.752 --> 27:54.046
and the wisdom that you have known
a singular joy.

27:54.756 --> 27:58.258
- I wrote that for my girlfriend.
- Local gal?

27:58.927 --> 28:01.845
Diane Shapiro, Ph.D., Brandeis.

28:04.849 --> 28:09.436
Harry, one miss, five hits, three kills.
Excellent.

28:13.525 --> 28:14.566
Only four hits?

28:15.610 --> 28:18.070
I put four through the eyes
and one through each nostril.

28:18.238 --> 28:19.655
Nice pattern.

28:19.823 --> 28:22.866
Agent Cooper, I'm
looking at the files from Dr. Lydecker's.

28:23.034 --> 28:25.035
And for instance,
I have here in the A's an Arky,

28:25.203 --> 28:27.955
who's a part poodle, part rottweiler

28:28.123 --> 28:30.207
who lives on Maple
and belongs to Mr. Rumple.

28:30.375 --> 28:33.127
Then, for example, I have an Annette,
who's an otter

28:33.294 --> 28:34.962
who lives with a family
near Elk River.

28:35.130 --> 28:37.214
We wanted the name of birds.

28:37.382 --> 28:40.092
I know, but the files
are all organized alphabetically.

28:40.260 --> 28:42.261
Lucy, go through the bird file.

28:42.429 --> 28:43.929
No, no, you don't understand.

28:44.097 --> 28:48.225
They're organized alphabetically
in the names of the pet.

28:48.393 --> 28:50.686
We're gonna need
some more coffee.

29:03.491 --> 29:09.621
Thanks, Toad. I'll be sure to get this
into my retirement fund ASAP.

29:14.169 --> 29:16.587
Shelly, you're gonna
scare the customers.

29:16.755 --> 29:20.924
I've got one man too many in my life,
and I'm married to him.

29:21.092 --> 29:25.471
- Sound familiar?
- You should have a little talk with Leo.

29:26.890 --> 29:31.435
Leo doesn't talk. He hits.

29:33.229 --> 29:35.189
He was so great at first, you know?

29:36.024 --> 29:38.650
This flashy guy in his hot car.

29:38.818 --> 29:40.152
Then we get married,

29:40.320 --> 29:44.573
and I find out all he was looking for
was a maid he didn't have to pay.

29:46.534 --> 29:48.869
I feel so stupid.

29:49.913 --> 29:52.039
Look at us.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.584
Two men apiece,

29:55.752 --> 29:58.712
and we don't know what to do
with any of the four of them.

29:59.547 --> 30:01.006
So how did Hank's hearing go?

30:01.633 --> 30:03.509
They're not gonna decide
till this afternoon.

30:03.885 --> 30:05.677
Have you told him
you're divorcing him for Ed?

30:08.723 --> 30:10.891
When I saw him, I, uh...

30:11.726 --> 30:13.519
He might not even get out
this time around.

30:13.812 --> 30:17.272
Guess my plans
are a little up in the air.

30:17.440 --> 30:22.820
Yeah, well,
I've definitely got plans for Leo.

30:30.453 --> 30:31.912
You know what we're gonna do,
Shelly?

30:32.080 --> 30:35.123
Tomorrow you and I are gonna have
a day of beauty.

30:35.291 --> 30:38.919
A manicure, a facial, we're gonna have
our hair done, the works.

30:39.379 --> 30:41.421
We're gonna be the knockouts
of the Double R.

30:42.423 --> 30:43.590
It's my treat.

30:43.758 --> 30:45.133
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

30:45.343 --> 30:46.927
- Donna?
- Hi, James.

30:47.095 --> 30:48.971
- Donna!
- Hold on.

30:49.138 --> 30:51.390
Who the heck ever heard
of diet lasagna?

30:51.558 --> 30:53.517
Just a sec, Daddy.
I'll be right in, okay?

30:53.685 --> 30:55.477
- It's James.
- Hm.

30:55.645 --> 30:57.938
Hi, we're having this
church potluck dinner here tonight.

30:58.106 --> 31:00.440
Well, tell him
to get over here. I need help.

31:00.608 --> 31:01.775
- SOS.
- Okay.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.610
Mayday, mayday.

31:03.778 --> 31:04.820
Would you like to come?

31:05.196 --> 31:06.989
I don't think
I'd be very good company.

31:07.156 --> 31:10.284
Well, I think we need to talk. Um...

31:11.661 --> 31:13.036
I've found out some things.

31:13.204 --> 31:16.498
Audrey told me some stuff
and Mrs. Palmer saw something.

31:16.666 --> 31:19.376
- What?
- Well, if you come over, I can tell you.

31:19.544 --> 31:22.129
I'm gonna get something to eat.
Then I'll be over in a little bit.

31:22.297 --> 31:24.464
Okay. Bye.

31:33.933 --> 31:35.893
Hi.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.103
Who are you?

31:38.980 --> 31:41.315
My name's Madeleine Ferguson.

31:41.482 --> 31:45.652
- Laura was my cousin.
- James Hurley.

31:47.030 --> 31:50.490
Laura and I hadn't
seen each other much recently.

31:50.658 --> 31:51.867
I live in Missoula.

31:52.368 --> 31:56.038
- Did you know Laura well?
- I thought I did. Heh.

31:56.205 --> 31:58.040
Here you go.
I've got your order ready.

31:58.207 --> 32:00.208
- Thanks a lot.
Mm-hm.

32:01.669 --> 32:05.047
I'm picking up food
for my aunt and uncle.

32:05.214 --> 32:09.217
Aunt Sarah can't cook right now,
and Uncle Leland's up half the night

32:09.385 --> 32:11.678
listening to old music
and crying and stuff.

32:12.055 --> 32:15.641
But if I was cooking for them,
they'd be doing even worse. Heh. Heh.

32:16.768 --> 32:21.813
- Um, you think I look like Laura?
- Yes.

32:22.440 --> 32:25.025
We used to come visit Twin Peaks
when I was a kid.

32:25.193 --> 32:28.487
It was great.
We'd pretend we were sisters.

32:30.073 --> 32:31.990
I wish I'd known her better.

32:32.492 --> 32:34.701
It's so sad.

32:37.538 --> 32:41.208
Well, it was nice to meet you,
James Hurley.

32:41.542 --> 32:43.335
Nice to meet you too.

32:52.929 --> 32:55.263
Thanks for calling, Mr. Mooney.

33:04.774 --> 33:06.525
Are you okay?

33:07.944 --> 33:10.278
Hank got his parole.

33:11.906 --> 33:13.991
He's coming home.

33:21.290 --> 33:22.958
What's that?

33:23.126 --> 33:28.422
No, I don't know what you get when
you cross a Norwegian and a Swede.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.091
Oh, very good, sir, very good.

33:31.259 --> 33:34.094
I can't tell you how excited we are

33:34.262 --> 33:38.473
about bringing Icelandic investment
to the great Northwest.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.101
Would you put my brother
back on, please?

33:41.269 --> 33:47.024
Jerry, who the hell is that joker?
You're sure that he's the boss?

33:47.233 --> 33:51.028
Just make sure they don't start
taking eggnog in to the pilot.

33:51.195 --> 33:56.158
Jer, I've got the jet gassed up
and on the runway in Seattle.

33:56.325 --> 33:58.827
Usher these guys through customs,
make your connection,

33:58.995 --> 34:04.624
and save me some of whatever it is
that they're having. Ha-ha.

34:05.418 --> 34:07.169
Yeah.

34:08.004 --> 34:11.006
Oh, Audrey.
I didn't hear you come in.

34:11.174 --> 34:14.009
What is it this time?

34:15.344 --> 34:17.637
Dad, are you ashamed of me?

34:17.805 --> 34:19.890
Audrey, you're, uh...

34:20.641 --> 34:22.642
You're my daughter.

34:22.810 --> 34:25.062
I was thinking about
what we talked about the other night

34:25.229 --> 34:26.938
when you were so mad.

34:27.106 --> 34:29.775
It isn't that I'm ashamed of you,
Audrey.

34:29.942 --> 34:32.986
It's just that I wish
I could depend on you more,

34:33.154 --> 34:35.947
especially during a trying time
like this.

34:36.115 --> 34:38.992
Well, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

34:39.494 --> 34:42.162
Dad, I wanna change my life.

34:42.330 --> 34:45.957
I've decided I wanna help you
with the family business.

34:46.125 --> 34:48.877
I mean, one of these days
you'll need someone to take over,

34:49.045 --> 34:51.004
and obviously
it's not gonna be Johnny.

34:51.172 --> 34:54.883
Heh-heh. Oh, Audrey,
I wish that I could believe you.

34:55.051 --> 34:57.094
Daddy, please.

34:58.846 --> 35:05.852
I saw a friend of mine cut down like
a flower that had just begun to bloom.

35:08.981 --> 35:11.650
Life can be so short.

35:13.694 --> 35:15.320
There isn't all the time in the world,

35:15.488 --> 35:19.491
I see that now,
and I wanna change my life.

35:19.659 --> 35:22.077
How, exactly?

35:22.411 --> 35:23.954
I don't need to go to college.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.288
You can teach me the business,

35:25.456 --> 35:27.582
and I'm willing to start
at the absolute bottom.

35:27.750 --> 35:30.877
All right.
We've got some guests arriving.

35:31.045 --> 35:34.131
You go upstairs
and start making some beds.

35:34.298 --> 35:36.591
You still don't believe me?

35:36.759 --> 35:39.427
All right. Okay.

35:39.595 --> 35:43.890
Okay. All right, all right.

35:45.101 --> 35:46.643
Where would you start?

35:47.061 --> 35:49.855
Well, I think I should start
at the department store.

35:50.022 --> 35:53.191
Cosmetics or something.
Just part-time at first, till I graduate.

35:54.735 --> 35:56.862
You're really serious, aren't you?

35:57.029 --> 36:01.074
You have to start to think about
the future, Daddy, just like I am.

36:01.617 --> 36:05.328
- The future?
- Our family's future.

36:06.998 --> 36:09.291
Please let me be
your daughter again.

36:16.132 --> 36:17.841
Audrey...

36:39.322 --> 36:41.406
Hello, this is Benjamin Horne.

36:41.741 --> 36:43.533
Uh...

36:43.701 --> 36:46.286
I have to take this, sweetheart.

36:46.621 --> 36:48.496
Oh, okay.

36:50.291 --> 36:52.292
Thanks, Daddy.

37:01.219 --> 37:04.804
Thank you, Audrey.

37:11.979 --> 37:13.939
Where have you been?

37:14.607 --> 37:18.235
Meet me down by the river
in a half-hour.

37:18.736 --> 37:20.612
And be discreet.

37:25.493 --> 37:29.537
Here's a bird. Louis Armstrong.
He's a parakeet.

37:29.705 --> 37:30.789
Put it with the others.

37:30.957 --> 37:31.998
Agent Cooper,

37:32.166 --> 37:33.541
I've got Gordon Cole on the phone.

37:33.709 --> 37:34.960
- Cooper here.
- Coop,

37:35.127 --> 37:38.213
Albert is faxing you his reconstruction
of the plastic object

37:38.381 --> 37:40.173
found in Laura Palmer's stomach.

37:40.341 --> 37:43.218
He's also determined the bites and
marks on her shoulders were made

37:43.386 --> 37:45.971
by a parrot or a myna bird.

37:46.138 --> 37:48.890
That's it. You're up to date.

37:49.767 --> 37:52.727
- Take a look at this.
- Something with the letter J.

37:53.688 --> 37:55.313
Poker chip.

37:55.898 --> 37:57.148
One-Eyed Jack's.

37:58.025 --> 37:59.693
Waldo!

37:59.860 --> 38:03.321
Harry, Agent Cooper,
it's a myna bird named Waldo.

38:03.489 --> 38:05.615
A myna bird
owned by Jacques Renault.

38:05.783 --> 38:08.493
I'll get his home address.

38:08.661 --> 38:11.329
Gentlemen, when two separate events
occur simultaneously

38:11.497 --> 38:14.374
pertaining to the same object
of inquiry,

38:14.542 --> 38:17.711
we must always pay strict attention.

38:17.878 --> 38:19.754
Fellas, let's make a house call.

38:27.096 --> 38:28.847
Nice game.

38:48.951 --> 38:53.204
Jacques, it's Harry Truman.
Open the door.

39:03.049 --> 39:05.884
- He's headed around the side.
- Go get him.

39:14.518 --> 39:16.311
Let's get Forensics
and seal this room, Harry.

39:16.479 --> 39:19.272
- Harry?
- Yeah, Hawk.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.941
He got away from me.
I lost him in the woods.

39:22.109 --> 39:23.610
Harry?

39:27.615 --> 39:31.868
"L.J." Leo Johnson.
Leo Johnson and Jacques Renault.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.620
That's our connection.

39:54.183 --> 39:55.934
Hm?

39:56.644 --> 39:58.311
Nice touch, Leo, nice touch.

39:58.479 --> 40:01.773
Bright-red sports car
for a secret meeting. Nice.

40:02.149 --> 40:04.192
- You don't like it, get somebody else.
- Oh, no, no.

40:04.360 --> 40:06.361
Hank said that you were gifted.
I believed him.

40:06.529 --> 40:10.198
But, Leo, your whole approach,
it's misguided.

40:10.366 --> 40:13.368
Major career opportunity
staring you in the face,

40:13.536 --> 40:17.914
and all you can think about is car wax
and chicken-feed drug transactions.

40:18.082 --> 40:21.709
Hey, I'm out $10,000. Maybe
that's peanuts to you, not to me.

40:21.877 --> 40:26.256
You were in business with a couple
glue-sniffing squish-heads, Leo.

40:26.757 --> 40:29.801
The Renault brothers?
I broke up their act.

40:29.969 --> 40:31.886
This is Bernie.

40:32.721 --> 40:35.056
Jacques is back in Canada.
We had a long talk.

40:35.224 --> 40:37.517
He's staying there.

40:38.894 --> 40:40.812
Jacques was the brains in the outfit.

40:40.980 --> 40:43.440
Bernie made bail this morning
on possession.

40:43.607 --> 40:49.237
Ahem. And do we know
if, uh, the late Bernard gave you up?

40:49.405 --> 40:51.698
I told him if he ever did, I'd kill him.

40:51.866 --> 40:53.908
Oh, and did he?

40:54.076 --> 40:58.663
No, he shouldn't have trusted me,
but like I said, Bernie wasn't too bright.

40:58.831 --> 41:03.877
Okay. One last chance, Leo.
Don't disappoint me.

41:04.044 --> 41:07.172
- The mill?
- Keep it simple.

41:07.339 --> 41:13.052
Insurance investigator should read
arson, block letters, about 6 feet high.

41:13.220 --> 41:15.638
The deal as we discussed?

41:16.098 --> 41:17.182
The rest on delivery.

41:17.892 --> 41:20.393
Three nights, Leo. Green light.

41:20.561 --> 41:22.395
Is that clear enough?

41:25.024 --> 41:26.900
But if Mrs. Palmer
knows about the necklace...

41:27.067 --> 41:29.068
- How? How could she know?
- She said she saw it.

41:29.236 --> 41:33.072
She said she had a vision
and she saw someone take it.

41:33.365 --> 41:34.991
Donna.

41:36.785 --> 41:39.078
Donna, it's not here.

41:39.497 --> 41:42.790
Somebody must have seen us.
Somebody must have followed us here.

41:43.250 --> 41:46.377
How?
How could Mrs. Palmer know?

41:46.921 --> 41:50.131
Laura used to say
her mother was kind of spooky.

41:50.299 --> 41:52.383
She used to see things.
She had these dreams.

41:52.551 --> 41:54.677
Laura did too.

42:02.144 --> 42:05.813
- Maybe we should tell somebody.
- You mean the police?

42:05.981 --> 42:08.316
Well, if it was the killer,
then he knows that we know.

42:08.484 --> 42:12.403
James, the police didn't love Laura.
Nobody loved her but us.

42:14.865 --> 42:17.325
I keep thinking I'm gonna see her.

42:17.785 --> 42:20.036
I think that, you know,
I'm gonna catch a glimpse of her

42:20.204 --> 42:21.996
out of the corner of my eye.

42:22.164 --> 42:24.374
Sometimes it's like
I really do see her.

42:24.542 --> 42:28.586
James, listen.
We're gonna find out who killed her.

42:29.213 --> 42:31.548
This is about us.

42:31.715 --> 42:36.594
We have to do this for us,
not just for her.

42:49.525 --> 42:53.695
James, I wanna be with you.

43:12.506 --> 43:13.548
Hello?

43:13.716 --> 43:14.841
Josie, it's me.

43:15.009 --> 43:16.217
Hi.

43:16.385 --> 43:20.638
We just got a break
in the Palmer case. I can't get away.

43:21.015 --> 43:24.475
- I miss you. I need to talk to you.
- I wanna talk to you too.

43:25.019 --> 43:28.563
Josie, were you at the
Timber Falls Motel this afternoon?

43:29.315 --> 43:33.151
Eh, I have to go.
Um, call me tomorrow?

43:33.402 --> 43:34.444
Goodbye.

43:40.534 --> 43:43.745
Blow the whistle, Josie.
It's quitting time.

43:43.912 --> 43:45.705
How did the shift go, Pete?

43:45.873 --> 43:50.543
Oh, cut some wood,
made some lumber.

43:51.920 --> 43:54.839
- I'm so tired, I could...
- You could eat a horse?

43:55.007 --> 43:59.260
- I made you a turkey sandwich.
- Oh, that's fantastic, Josie.

43:59.428 --> 44:02.889
- Uh, is Catherine asleep?
- Yeah.

44:03.057 --> 44:06.017
Good, then give me some mayo
with that.

44:07.561 --> 44:12.565
Josie, uh, how do you feel about fish?

44:12.775 --> 44:15.443
- To eat?
- No, to catch.

44:15.611 --> 44:18.905
See, the Fishing Association,

44:19.073 --> 44:23.576
their annual do is coming up,
and, uh, I'm defending champion.

44:23.744 --> 44:27.955
And this year, well, they're adding
a mixed-doubles division,

44:28.123 --> 44:33.753
and I thought, well,
if you were interested, uh,

44:34.171 --> 44:39.175
what the heck, uh, would you like to,
uh, partner up with me?

44:39.551 --> 44:42.845
Well, Pete, I don't know the first step
about fishing.

44:43.013 --> 44:47.517
Oh, Josie, there's enough
fishing in me for the both of us.

44:47.935 --> 44:50.853
- Well, what do you think?
- Sure, Pete.

44:51.021 --> 44:53.523
Let's give it the run at the money.

44:54.650 --> 45:00.530
Josie, you're my kind of gal.
Here. I'm gonna hit the hay.

45:00.698 --> 45:04.951
- Sweet dreams, Pete.
- Sweet dreams, Josie.

45:44.283 --> 45:45.324
Hello.

45:45.492 --> 45:47.744
Did you get my message?

45:47.911 --> 45:48.953
Yes.

45:52.916 --> 47:00.358
Catch you later.
