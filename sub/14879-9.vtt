WEBVTT

00:03.335 --> 00:04.842
Hey. I'm gonna be
working late tonight,

00:04.910 --> 00:06.735
so don't wait up.

00:06.803 --> 00:08.872
Are those scones?
Easy, Debbie drive-thru.

00:08.940 --> 00:11.276
Sit down and eat
with your sister.

00:11.344 --> 00:12.711
Do you remember her?

00:12.779 --> 00:14.345
The one who bakes you
goodies every day?

00:14.413 --> 00:16.280
Yeah, sounds
vaguely familiar,

00:16.347 --> 00:17.885
but I am so late.

00:17.953 --> 00:19.455
Oh, well,
then I'll drive you.

00:19.523 --> 00:20.957
- Uh...
- Come on.

00:21.025 --> 00:22.497
I am seriously overdue
for some Annie time.

00:22.565 --> 00:24.133
Annie time
is pretty awesome,

00:24.201 --> 00:26.400
but I need my car
because I have a thing tonight.

00:26.468 --> 00:28.102
I thought you said
you were working late.

00:28.170 --> 00:29.703
Yeah, that "Thing"
is an acquisitions conference

00:29.771 --> 00:31.303
in Arlington.
I know.

00:31.371 --> 00:32.805
Thrilling stuff,
right?

00:32.872 --> 00:34.738
You know, you've been working
past 10:00 for weeks now.

00:34.806 --> 00:36.504
Is everything okay?

00:36.572 --> 00:39.972
Yeah, it's fine.
Have a great day.

01:13.006 --> 01:16.377
Yield, people!
Why won't you yield?

01:32.994 --> 01:34.695
Auggie! Wait up.

01:34.763 --> 01:36.529
Twenty minutes late, Walker?

01:36.597 --> 01:37.864
If I didn't know you
any better,

01:37.932 --> 01:39.365
I'd say you
were getting cocky.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.300
Actually, I had to drive
all the way to Capitol Hill

01:41.368 --> 01:42.668
to lose a tail.

01:42.736 --> 01:45.003
Seeing as I'm
only 20 minutes late,

01:45.071 --> 01:46.472
I have good reason
to be cocky.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.541
Probably another round
of random surveillance checks.

01:48.608 --> 01:49.909
Was it C.I.C.?

01:49.977 --> 01:51.445
Worse.
My sister.

01:51.512 --> 01:52.746
Ouch.

01:52.814 --> 01:54.281
If I can't fool
my sister,

01:54.349 --> 01:56.149
how am I gonna fare against
F.S.B. counter-intelligence?

01:56.217 --> 01:58.519
Nah, what you're going through
is completely normal.

01:58.586 --> 01:59.854
When I first joined
the agency,

01:59.922 --> 02:01.990
my brother tailed me,
he checked emails,

02:02.058 --> 02:03.324
eavesdropped
on phone calls.

02:03.392 --> 02:04.692
After a while,
he just stopped.

02:04.760 --> 02:07.228
- Why'd he lose interest?
- I bought him an Xbox.

02:07.296 --> 02:09.463
I don't think that's
gonna work with my sister.

02:09.531 --> 02:10.798
Meh.

02:10.866 --> 02:12.700
What's Arthur doing
in the D.P.D.?

02:12.768 --> 02:14.402
If Arthur's in here,

02:14.469 --> 02:16.737
it's either bad news
or really bad news.

02:16.805 --> 02:19.206
He's walking with Joan
up to her office.

02:19.274 --> 02:21.975
- Huh.
- Morning.

02:22.043 --> 02:25.478
I'm afraid I'm here
under unfortunate circumstances.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.647
Two days ago,
an active C.I.A. case officer,

02:27.714 --> 02:30.283
codename Moonlight,
was killed in the line of duty.

02:30.351 --> 02:32.486
The loss of life
for any public servant

02:32.553 --> 02:33.920
is tragic,

02:33.988 --> 02:36.657
but at the agency,
it is the rarest of events.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.459
In the last 65 years,

02:38.526 --> 02:42.263
the U.S. Armed Forces
have lost 101,712 lives,

02:42.331 --> 02:45.367
law enforcement,
10,635,

02:45.434 --> 02:48.437
C.I.A., 103.

02:48.505 --> 02:51.173
The number lost
on U.S. soil, 4.

02:51.241 --> 02:53.643
Those with "Need to know"
will be looped in further.

02:53.711 --> 02:56.180
Until then,
all I can say is

02:56.247 --> 02:59.083
we've lost
a good operative.

03:03.088 --> 03:05.957
I've never seen it
so quiet in here.

03:06.025 --> 03:07.259
If they can get
to one of us,

03:07.326 --> 03:08.527
it means they
can get to any of us.

03:08.594 --> 03:11.564
Annie...
A word?

03:18.740 --> 03:22.109
I have something
very difficult to tell you.

03:22.177 --> 03:23.944
The operative
who was killed,

03:24.012 --> 03:26.547
he was someone
you knew.

03:26.614 --> 03:27.981
That's impossible.

03:28.049 --> 03:31.752
Every covert operative I know
is in that bullpen.

03:33.454 --> 03:35.322
Mark Ramsay?
Why do you have

03:35.390 --> 03:38.625
a photo of my Georgetown
language professor?

03:38.693 --> 03:40.560
Was he somehow associated
with Moonlight?

03:40.628 --> 03:43.063
Annie,
he <i>was</i> Moonlight.

03:43.130 --> 03:46.252
And you're the only one
who can help us find his killer.

I always thought Mark was this
bookish language professor,

04:39.110 --> 04:41.711
and now you're saying he was
with the C.I.A. for 20 years.

04:41.779 --> 04:43.681
His NOC gave him
unparalleled access.

04:43.749 --> 04:46.250
He taught all over the world--
Lomonosov, The Sorbonne,

04:46.317 --> 04:47.751
E.T.H. Zurich.

04:47.819 --> 04:50.521
He recruited some of the
agency's most valuable assets,

04:50.588 --> 04:52.022
who still pay dividends
to this day.

04:52.090 --> 04:53.391
The last time
I saw Mark,

04:53.458 --> 04:54.859
he begged me not
to join the agency.

04:54.927 --> 04:56.895
Why would he do that
if he was an operative?

04:56.963 --> 04:59.965
Maybe he was pushing you
to test your resolve.

05:00.032 --> 05:02.133
Ramsay was tracking
a local spy ring,

05:02.201 --> 05:04.001
a Pakistani
state-sponsored group

05:04.069 --> 05:05.637
called <i>Lashkar-e-Taiba.</i>

05:05.704 --> 05:07.105
We think he
got too close,

05:07.172 --> 05:08.573
and his contact inside
turned on him.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.341
What does his wife have
to do with this?

05:10.409 --> 05:12.543
Mark was making monthly drops
of his findings

05:12.611 --> 05:14.913
but was killed before
he could make his last one.

05:14.980 --> 05:17.048
We think that intel
held the identity

05:17.116 --> 05:19.083
of the entire
<i>Lashkar</i> spy ring,

05:19.151 --> 05:20.652
and we need you to leverage
your relationship with Safia

05:20.719 --> 05:22.087
in order to find it.

05:22.154 --> 05:23.955
You want me to go to the house
of a grieving widow

05:24.022 --> 05:25.223
whose husband
was just murdered

05:25.291 --> 05:26.758
and ask her where
the classified documents

05:26.826 --> 05:29.861
are hidden?
If only it were that simple.

05:29.929 --> 05:31.563
You can't mention
the C.I.A.

05:31.631 --> 05:35.967
Safia didn't know Mark
was with the Agency?

05:36.035 --> 05:37.969
How is that possible?

05:38.037 --> 05:40.605
Have you told
your sister?

05:41.841 --> 05:43.175
If Mark didn't
tell his wife,

05:43.243 --> 05:44.510
it's not our place
to either.

05:44.577 --> 05:46.579
You're to go to Safia
under the guise

05:46.646 --> 05:48.347
of paying
your respects.

05:48.415 --> 05:50.249
We don't have time
for a slow-burn approach.

05:50.317 --> 05:52.118
Annie should just lay
her cards on the table

05:52.186 --> 05:54.087
and read Safia in.

05:54.155 --> 05:55.855
Okay.

05:58.793 --> 06:00.794
So just tell Safia
the truth

06:00.861 --> 06:02.329
and get her permission
to bring everything back

06:02.397 --> 06:03.697
to Langley for inspection.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.937
I just heard.
I am so sorry.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.472
It still
doesn't seem real.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.475
That your professor died,
or that he was C.I.A.?

06:16.542 --> 06:19.679
- Both, I guess.
- Huh.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.347
And now I have to
go tell Safia

06:21.414 --> 06:22.916
that he spent
their entire marriage

06:22.983 --> 06:24.417
living a lie?

06:24.485 --> 06:25.952
It's like delivering
the message your husband died

06:26.020 --> 06:27.621
all over again.

06:27.689 --> 06:28.956
What's that?

06:29.023 --> 06:30.557
I thought you could use
some cheering up,

06:30.625 --> 06:34.028
so I bought you
a Zeiss A1 Axio

06:34.095 --> 06:36.864
with phase contrast
and a digital camera adapter.

06:36.932 --> 06:38.365
- Fantastic.
- Mm-hmm.

06:38.433 --> 06:40.468
I still don't know
what you're talking about.

06:40.535 --> 06:42.235
- It's a microscope.
- Mm-hmm.

06:42.303 --> 06:43.837
And we're gonna
use this baby

06:43.905 --> 06:46.206
to interpret Ramsay's
intel transmission.

06:46.274 --> 06:47.574
Now, what Robert should be
showing you right now

06:47.642 --> 06:49.176
is a microdot.

06:49.244 --> 06:51.011
I remember reading
about those at the farm.

06:51.079 --> 06:53.681
Full-size documents
shrunk to a single period.

06:53.748 --> 06:55.349
Put one on
a normal-looking document

06:55.416 --> 06:57.150
and they're
impossible to find.

06:57.218 --> 06:59.353
But if you know
where to look...

07:01.189 --> 07:02.956
Is it working?
Do you see anything?

07:03.024 --> 07:05.326
Yeah.
It's amazing.

07:05.393 --> 07:07.228
Good. Wasn't sure
how it was gonna play out.

07:07.295 --> 07:09.230
I thought we stopped using
these after World War II.

07:09.297 --> 07:11.532
Yeah, well, Ramsay
was an old-school spy.

07:11.600 --> 07:12.833
Sometimes
the lo-fi approach

07:12.901 --> 07:15.035
is the best way
to stay under the radar.

07:15.103 --> 07:17.170
Great.
So all I have to do

07:17.238 --> 07:19.172
is scour the house
of a college professor,

07:19.240 --> 07:22.041
looking for a single
millimeter-sized period

07:22.109 --> 07:23.509
on a normal-looking
document.

07:23.576 --> 07:25.277
Yeah, it's like finding
a needle in a haystack

07:25.345 --> 07:27.679
in a forest full of haystacks.
Yeah.

07:27.747 --> 07:29.648
Ironically, I have
about as much chance

07:29.715 --> 07:31.482
of finding it
as you do.

07:31.550 --> 07:33.184
Oh, come on,
that's funny 'cause...

07:33.252 --> 07:35.152
Sorry. I was...

07:35.220 --> 07:38.389
Still thinking about
breaking the news to Safia.

07:38.457 --> 07:41.326
I've never read
someone in before.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.429
Is there C.I.A. protocol
for how to do it?

07:43.496 --> 07:46.666
No. There are
as many approaches

07:46.734 --> 07:48.835
as there are personalities
in the Agency.

07:48.903 --> 07:51.138
The important thing
is to be direct

07:51.205 --> 07:54.108
and definitive.

07:54.175 --> 07:56.978
They were married
for 15 years, Auggie.

07:57.046 --> 07:59.313
This is
gonna shatter her.

07:59.381 --> 08:03.284
It'll be easier
coming from a friend.

08:03.352 --> 08:07.087
It would've been easier
coming from her husband.

08:09.924 --> 08:12.625
♪ ♪

08:12.693 --> 08:14.027
Is this the...

08:26.707 --> 08:30.010
Rachmaninoff was the bane
of my existence in grad school.

08:30.077 --> 08:31.878
The man had hands
the size of shovels.

08:31.946 --> 08:33.847
It hardly seemed fair.

08:33.914 --> 08:35.181
Annie.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.720
It's been far too long.

08:41.389 --> 08:43.623
I'm so sorry
about Mark.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.792
<i>Inna lillahi wa inna</i>
<i>ilayhi raji'un.</i>

08:45.860 --> 08:48.962
Mark always said
you were his star student.

08:49.030 --> 08:51.798
He did love Callas,
didn't he.

08:51.866 --> 08:55.602
Come. We'll
put them in water.

08:55.669 --> 08:58.804
You're sure you're okay having
so many people over so soon?

08:58.872 --> 09:00.840
Mark's students
were his passion.

09:00.907 --> 09:02.909
I can't think of a better way
to celebrate his life

09:02.976 --> 09:05.311
than having everyone over
for good food

09:05.379 --> 09:08.181
and good conversation, eh?

09:08.248 --> 09:10.483
Actually, there is something
I wanted to talk to you about.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.552
The lamb.

09:13.620 --> 09:15.221
Mark was always
the cook,

09:15.289 --> 09:18.191
but I'm making do.

09:18.259 --> 09:20.427
He learned to make
this lamb <i>biryani</i> dish

09:20.495 --> 09:22.328
to impress me
when we were first dating.

09:22.396 --> 09:23.997
I didn't have the heart
to tell him I preferred

09:24.065 --> 09:25.231
burgers and fries.

09:30.705 --> 09:32.205
- Mmm.
- Little dry?

09:32.272 --> 09:34.908
- It's delicious.
- Huh?

09:34.975 --> 09:36.343
Can I have
a glass of water?

09:36.410 --> 09:38.612
Of course.

09:41.149 --> 09:42.849
Would you...

09:42.917 --> 09:44.351
Pardon me
for a moment, please?

09:44.419 --> 09:47.422
Sure.

09:49.425 --> 09:51.092
You must've tried
the lamb.

09:51.160 --> 09:52.727
How can something
be both...

09:52.795 --> 09:54.596
Cold and burnt
at the same time?

09:54.664 --> 09:55.998
I know. Clearly you
haven't been here

09:56.065 --> 09:57.466
the past two days.

09:57.534 --> 09:59.401
Is she really okay?

09:59.469 --> 10:00.702
She seems in
awfully good spirits

10:00.770 --> 10:02.103
for all
she's been through.

10:02.171 --> 10:03.371
Well, she hasn't slept
or left the house

10:03.438 --> 10:05.005
since Mark was killed.

10:05.073 --> 10:07.007
I knew something
didn't seem right.

10:07.075 --> 10:09.510
Actually, it's a totally
normal defense mechanism

10:09.578 --> 10:11.445
according to
the Kubler-Ross grief model.

10:11.513 --> 10:13.114
Although there is some
convincing scholarship

10:13.181 --> 10:16.050
out of Yale disputing their
classical five stages theory.

10:16.118 --> 10:19.119
Fascinating. Would you, uh,
excuse me for just a second?

10:19.187 --> 10:22.056
All right.

10:22.123 --> 10:24.791
Could I--could I talk to you
for a second in private?

10:24.859 --> 10:27.794
It's about Mark.

10:27.862 --> 10:29.796
Stay for lunch.

10:29.864 --> 10:32.133
After everybody leaves,
we'll have time to talk.

10:32.200 --> 10:34.735
- Mm.
- But first...

10:34.803 --> 10:37.472
We feast on lamb.

10:42.545 --> 10:43.879
I'll never forget
my father's face

10:43.947 --> 10:46.615
when they first met.

10:46.683 --> 10:49.318
You have to understand,
for a traditional Pakistani,

10:49.386 --> 10:51.955
there's only one sin worse
than marrying an American.

10:52.022 --> 10:53.857
Marrying
an African-American?

10:53.925 --> 10:55.425
Exactly.

10:55.493 --> 10:58.794
But when Mark
broke out in fluent Urdu

10:58.862 --> 11:00.363
and named
the starting midfield

11:00.431 --> 11:02.598
of the Pakistani
Football Federation,

11:02.666 --> 11:05.367
dad was sold.

11:05.434 --> 11:07.535
So how much longer
do we have to walk

11:07.603 --> 11:10.338
before you show me
what's in that envelope?

11:13.875 --> 11:17.444
This is hard.
Sorry.

11:27.791 --> 11:30.393
What--what is this?

11:30.461 --> 11:33.364
- It's a commendation record.
- Yes, I can see that.

11:33.431 --> 11:35.199
But why does it say
"Central Intelligence Agency"

11:35.267 --> 11:37.368
on the top?
Because Mark was

11:37.436 --> 11:39.870
an undercover
C.I.A. operative.

11:39.938 --> 11:43.040
For 20 years.

11:43.108 --> 11:45.676
I work for the C.I.A.
as well.

11:47.646 --> 11:50.815
That's what
I came here to say.

12:16.843 --> 12:19.545
Safia, wait.
Please let me explain.

12:19.612 --> 12:21.246
Nothing to explain.

12:21.314 --> 12:22.981
Mark was no spy.

12:23.049 --> 12:25.718
His idea of danger was a jacket
without elbow patches.

12:25.785 --> 12:28.219
I know how you're feeling.
This was a shock for me too.

12:28.287 --> 12:30.654
With respect, you don't
have the slightest idea

12:30.722 --> 12:31.856
what I'm feeling.

12:31.923 --> 12:33.857
And yet somehow
you feel entitled

12:33.925 --> 12:36.860
to come out here,
make up some absurd fabrication,

12:36.928 --> 12:38.728
and try to flip
my life upside down.

12:38.796 --> 12:42.966
Please...
Just go home.

12:55.881 --> 12:58.283
Come on.

13:13.468 --> 13:15.904
We gotta go now!

13:46.576 --> 13:48.510
Nice work clocking
the license plate.

13:48.578 --> 13:50.145
Jai's running it now.
It's definitely <i>Lashkar.</i>

13:50.213 --> 13:51.547
They're trying to
eliminate Ramsay's intel

13:51.615 --> 13:52.982
before we find it.

13:53.049 --> 13:56.051
How's Safia
handling everything?

13:56.119 --> 13:57.285
I don't think this is
quite the way she envisioned

13:57.353 --> 13:58.453
her day going.

13:58.521 --> 14:00.255
Are the movers
really necessary?

14:00.323 --> 14:01.991
They're
absolutely necessary.

14:02.059 --> 14:03.827
It's standard procedure
when any officer dies

14:03.894 --> 14:06.629
to scour every inch of his life
and reconstruct loose ends.

14:06.697 --> 14:08.398
We need to find
that microdot.

14:08.465 --> 14:10.099
No stone goes unturned.

14:10.167 --> 14:12.734
Two armed <i>Lashkar</i> militants
are after that intel

14:12.802 --> 14:14.069
and are willing
to kill for it.

14:14.137 --> 14:15.871
Whatever leeway time
we thought we had,

14:15.938 --> 14:18.006
we obviously don't.
Stay on 'em.

14:18.074 --> 14:19.475
Ma'am, I told you,
we have orders

14:19.543 --> 14:21.043
to take everything
back to Langley.

14:21.111 --> 14:22.478
Annie, tell him he
can't take my instruments.

14:22.546 --> 14:24.314
That was my grandfather's
concert violin!

14:24.382 --> 14:25.749
Don't worry.
We'll put everything back

14:25.817 --> 14:27.251
exactly how we found it.

14:28.753 --> 14:31.756
Guys, why don't you
take five?

14:38.764 --> 14:40.231
What's this all about?

14:40.299 --> 14:41.632
These men are looking
for information

14:41.700 --> 14:43.868
to identify Mark's killer--
Not the movers.

14:43.935 --> 14:46.803
The thugs who shot at us.

14:46.871 --> 14:48.272
Are they the ones
who murdered Mark?

14:48.339 --> 14:49.806
We still don't know.

14:49.874 --> 14:51.374
We think so.

14:54.478 --> 14:57.681
So it's true.
He was a C.I.A. Agent.

15:05.691 --> 15:08.026
I went to his office.

15:08.093 --> 15:09.794
I sat in
on his classes.

15:09.862 --> 15:11.363
So that was all fake?

15:11.431 --> 15:13.999
Mark's job
at Georgetown was real.

15:14.067 --> 15:15.835
And when he taught abroad,
that was real too.

15:15.903 --> 15:17.970
I still think of him
as my professor.

15:18.038 --> 15:21.740
But he was also
recruiting assets,

15:21.808 --> 15:23.576
and spying on
foreign nationals,

15:23.644 --> 15:25.644
and sending that information
back to Langley.

15:25.712 --> 15:27.446
That's when
he should've told me.

15:27.514 --> 15:29.315
I would've understood.
I'm sure there were

15:29.383 --> 15:30.851
a million times
he wanted to,

15:30.918 --> 15:32.185
but it's hard to find
the right moment.

15:32.253 --> 15:35.154
And the longer you wait,
the harder it gets.

15:37.124 --> 15:39.725
So instead he just
came home every night,

15:39.793 --> 15:42.195
looked me in the eye,

15:42.262 --> 15:44.464
and lied to me.

15:47.234 --> 15:49.702
Compartmentalizing
is the only way

15:49.770 --> 15:52.571
that some operatives
can cope.

15:52.639 --> 15:55.975
If anything, I'm sure
he was trying to protect you

15:56.043 --> 15:57.443
from danger.

15:57.511 --> 15:59.178
Safia, we need
to start talking about

15:59.246 --> 16:00.680
a safe place
for you to stay.

16:00.748 --> 16:03.083
No. You've taken enough
from me already.

16:03.150 --> 16:04.917
I'm not leaving.

16:04.985 --> 16:06.786
Annie.

16:06.854 --> 16:09.255
We found this behind
a false wall in the closet.

16:09.323 --> 16:12.592
It looks like
a safety deposit box key.

16:12.660 --> 16:15.495
Do you know anything
about that?

16:15.562 --> 16:16.596
Mm-mm.

16:20.034 --> 16:23.936
How is it you guys
didn't even know about this box?

16:24.004 --> 16:25.905
Spies are
secretive people.

16:25.973 --> 16:29.042
Home vaults, bank boxes,
safe houses...

16:29.109 --> 16:31.844
Anything to keep sensitive intel
out of the wrong hands.

16:31.912 --> 16:36.416
Doesn't it get tiring,
keeping all these secrets?

16:36.483 --> 16:38.251
Sometimes.

16:38.318 --> 16:40.887
Please take as much time
as you need.

16:42.890 --> 16:44.557
Thank you.

16:57.671 --> 17:00.139
What is that?
It's a microdot kit.

17:00.207 --> 17:03.476
Mark used this to create
his intelligence transmissions.

17:05.679 --> 17:10.050
Oh, my God.
Look at all this stuff.

17:13.188 --> 17:16.257
These--these
are postcards from...

17:16.325 --> 17:17.692
Every city
we've ever visited--

17:17.760 --> 17:21.161
Athens, Shanghai...

17:21.229 --> 17:23.497
Lisbon.

17:23.565 --> 17:26.098
Summers in Maine.

17:26.166 --> 17:28.167
I can't believe
he kept all these.

17:42.084 --> 17:44.285
Mark's wedding vows.

17:44.353 --> 17:46.922
He was so nervous
that day.

17:48.591 --> 17:51.126
He could wax eloquent in front
of a packed lecture hall,

17:51.194 --> 17:54.596
but when he read these...

17:54.664 --> 17:56.832
His voice trembled.

18:04.139 --> 18:06.006
I'm so sorry.

18:06.074 --> 18:08.409
I have to take all this
back to Langley.

18:10.445 --> 18:12.146
We will get it
back to you

18:12.214 --> 18:13.881
the moment
we are done with it.

18:13.949 --> 18:15.616
No, it's okay.

18:17.119 --> 18:19.453
I understand.

18:27.496 --> 18:29.497
Okay.

18:38.775 --> 18:41.210
What's the word
from the embassy?

18:41.277 --> 18:46.048
I'm compiling a briefing
for Arthur right now.

18:46.115 --> 18:49.051
Maybe you can brief
your boss first.

18:49.119 --> 18:51.386
Islamabad's
in full denial mode.

18:51.454 --> 18:53.622
They claim they shut down
all militant groups.

18:53.690 --> 18:54.890
According to
the Pakistani government,

18:54.958 --> 18:56.458
<i>Lashkar</i> doesn't exist.

18:56.525 --> 18:58.927
Huh. Trying telling
Safia Ramsay that.

18:58.995 --> 19:00.662
And what do we
have on the car?

19:00.730 --> 19:02.531
The Chrysler?
The car was a rental.

19:02.598 --> 19:06.268
We traced payment back to
the Pakistani Welfare Agency.

19:06.336 --> 19:08.404
Well, that's right out
of the playbook, isn't it,

19:08.472 --> 19:10.806
using a charitable organization
as a front.

19:10.874 --> 19:12.341
"Give us money
for food aid,

19:12.409 --> 19:14.143
and we'll use it
to buy guns."

19:14.211 --> 19:16.244
And what do we have
on the P.W.A.?

19:16.312 --> 19:18.347
Small D.C.-based office.

19:18.414 --> 19:20.215
Pakistan desk's
been monitoring their activities

19:20.283 --> 19:22.117
since the 26/11
Mumbai attacks.

19:22.185 --> 19:25.754
I have full dossiers
on every employee.

19:27.289 --> 19:31.091
Oh, we've got
a lot of options here.

19:31.159 --> 19:34.428
Rubina Jafari.
Personal secretary to the C.E.O.

19:34.496 --> 19:36.663
Young, single.

19:36.730 --> 19:39.365
Jai, think you
can find an in?

19:39.433 --> 19:41.401
I don't think
that'll be a problem.

20:02.020 --> 20:04.055
There's baked Alaska
in the freezer.

20:04.123 --> 20:06.057
But I experimented
a little bit.

20:06.124 --> 20:08.827
It's a little too baked,
not quite enough Alaska.

20:11.430 --> 20:13.298
What are you
still doing up?

20:13.365 --> 20:15.000
Watching the coverage
of this horrible shooting

20:15.068 --> 20:16.535
in Georgetown.

20:16.602 --> 20:18.437
They say it's
a gang initiation.

20:18.504 --> 20:20.906
Can you imagine?

20:20.974 --> 20:23.910
And I drove past
that corner last week.

20:27.649 --> 20:29.650
Uh, I'm sure the cops
are on top of it.

20:29.718 --> 20:31.619
They usually--

20:31.687 --> 20:33.721
they usually get
those guys.

20:33.789 --> 20:35.356
But you know what? They said
he was a language professor

20:35.424 --> 20:37.692
at Georgetown.
Did you have him?

20:40.295 --> 20:42.530
He was my advisor,
actually.

20:45.233 --> 20:46.800
You mean, someone
you know was killed...

20:46.868 --> 20:48.935
And you didn't tell me?

20:49.003 --> 20:51.404
- It was a busy day.
- "Busy day" gets you out of

20:51.472 --> 20:52.905
not calling your niece
on her 3/4 birthday,

20:52.973 --> 20:55.775
not out of telling me
your--your friend was killed.

20:57.110 --> 20:58.711
Sorry.

20:58.779 --> 21:00.947
Can we just drop it?

21:05.453 --> 21:08.288
Oh, I'm sorry.

21:08.356 --> 21:09.957
No, I should be
more sympathetic.

21:10.024 --> 21:12.460
I can't imagine how hard
this must be for you.

21:12.528 --> 21:15.463
Uh...

21:15.531 --> 21:18.499
Thanks.

21:18.567 --> 21:20.368
Uh...

21:20.435 --> 21:22.770
For the record,
that was, um--

21:22.838 --> 21:25.274
it's just
the right amount of Alaska.

21:34.485 --> 21:36.552
So these are all
Ramsay's possessions?

21:36.620 --> 21:39.989
Everything from the house,
the office, the car...

21:40.057 --> 21:43.092
It's difficult enough finding
a document the size of a period.

21:43.160 --> 21:45.561
But when your subject
apparently never throws away

21:45.628 --> 21:47.896
a single book,
paper, or receipt,

21:47.964 --> 21:49.831
let's just say
it's been a long day.

21:49.899 --> 21:52.267
Probably doesn't help that he
was a fan of the ellipses.

21:52.335 --> 21:54.235
A double dash now and then
would be nice.

21:54.303 --> 21:56.170
Barber! Status report!

21:56.238 --> 21:58.373
Yeah, just finishing
our second pass.

21:58.440 --> 21:59.942
What do you want us
to do next?

22:00.009 --> 22:02.545
Third pass.

22:02.612 --> 22:04.781
You see, people?
It's just like I told you

22:04.849 --> 22:06.149
an hour ago.

22:06.217 --> 22:07.818
We're going to have
to do another pass.

22:07.885 --> 22:09.653
Where do you think
the microdot is?

22:09.721 --> 22:11.355
Maybe the guys
that ransacked his place

22:11.423 --> 22:12.557
got to it first.

22:12.625 --> 22:14.626
Maybe he kept his intel
somewhere else.

22:14.694 --> 22:16.161
Maybe there never was
a microdot.

22:16.229 --> 22:18.930
I have no idea.

22:18.998 --> 22:21.433
What about the stuff
from the safety deposit box?

22:21.501 --> 22:23.201
Ran it all
a dozen times.

22:23.269 --> 22:25.170
Nothing.

22:27.106 --> 22:29.407
Wait,
something's missing.

22:29.475 --> 22:31.443
Where are
the wedding vows?

22:32.712 --> 22:34.079
Is she home?

22:34.147 --> 22:35.747
No one has come or gone
since I've been here.

22:35.814 --> 22:37.182
Okay.

22:39.452 --> 22:41.486
Safia?

22:46.927 --> 22:49.662
Safia, I need
those wedding vows!

22:56.069 --> 22:58.203
So you're saying
Safia's working

22:58.271 --> 22:59.571
with the men
who killed Mark?

22:59.639 --> 23:01.073
She was born
three kilometers

23:01.141 --> 23:03.008
from the <i>Lashkar</i> headquarters
in Muridke.

23:03.076 --> 23:05.010
She's lived here
for 20 years.

23:05.078 --> 23:07.912
And these militant groups
love to recruit westerners.

23:07.980 --> 23:10.081
She's gone, Annie.
What does that tell you?

23:10.149 --> 23:11.416
That she could be
in trouble.

23:11.483 --> 23:13.150
Or she could be
fleeing from us.

23:13.218 --> 23:14.519
I understand
how you're feeling.

23:14.586 --> 23:16.120
You've just
lost a friend.

23:16.188 --> 23:18.489
But we have to be objective,
not emotional.

23:18.558 --> 23:20.191
It's our job.
I know this looks bad,

23:20.259 --> 23:21.459
but you have to
trust me on this.

23:21.527 --> 23:22.728
I know Safia.

23:22.795 --> 23:24.196
What she and Mark had
was real love,

23:24.264 --> 23:27.233
not some spy versus spy
espionage game.

23:27.301 --> 23:29.969
I'm not sure you knew Mark
as well as you thought you did.

23:36.243 --> 23:38.111
This is a paper I wrote for
Mark's Russian language class.

23:38.179 --> 23:41.046
Where'd you get this?

23:41.114 --> 23:43.615
Annie,
Mark was the one

23:43.683 --> 23:46.652
who originally submitted
your name to the C.I.A.

23:46.719 --> 23:49.087
He said you were one of
his brightest language students

23:49.155 --> 23:51.624
and we would be foolish
not to recruit you.

23:55.028 --> 23:57.730
So when I applied
to Langley three years ago--

23:57.798 --> 23:59.532
You'd already been
on our radar since college.

24:02.102 --> 24:05.371
Annie, I am not saying Safia
is definitely working

24:05.439 --> 24:07.106
with <i>Lashkar,</i> but we
wouldn't be doing our job

24:07.174 --> 24:09.008
unless we tracked her down
for questioning.

24:09.076 --> 24:10.343
I've got a team out
looking for her now.

24:10.410 --> 24:12.078
What are they gonna do
when they find her?

24:12.145 --> 24:13.679
For now,
we just wanna find out

24:13.746 --> 24:15.013
what she did
with those vows.

24:15.081 --> 24:17.950
She isn't being accused
of a crime...Yet.

24:18.018 --> 24:20.152
Uh, and--
and what can I do?

24:20.219 --> 24:22.787
You need to stay on the bench
until we find her.

24:22.854 --> 24:25.622
Is that clear?

24:25.690 --> 24:27.357
Annie.

24:27.425 --> 24:30.860
Is that clear?

24:30.928 --> 24:32.795
Yeah.

24:42.078 --> 24:44.846
No typing,
no pages turning.

24:44.913 --> 24:47.715
Even odds says you're staring
contemplatively into space,

24:47.782 --> 24:51.351
pondering the great mysteries
of the Universe.

24:51.419 --> 24:53.887
You ever wonder
why you were hired?

24:53.954 --> 24:55.489
10,000 applications
a month.

24:55.556 --> 24:56.991
Why'd the Agency
pick you?

24:57.058 --> 24:59.060
I always assumed
it was for my body.

24:59.127 --> 25:02.730
- Auggie.
- I was recruited.

25:02.798 --> 25:04.098
There are not
a lot of guys

25:04.166 --> 25:06.668
who can write an unbreakable
java-based daemon

25:06.736 --> 25:08.871
and who've won their high school
state wrestling championship

25:08.939 --> 25:11.140
two years in a row.
Why? What's on your mind?

25:11.208 --> 25:13.810
I always thought I came
to the Agency on my own terms.

25:13.877 --> 25:16.245
Now I find out they
had a file on me when I applied.

25:16.313 --> 25:18.981
Annie, it's the C.I.A.
we have a file on everyone.

25:20.751 --> 25:22.918
Had any progress
tracking down Safia?

25:22.986 --> 25:25.254
Nothing.
Joan's authorized a trace

25:25.321 --> 25:26.889
on her cell phone
and credit cards.

25:26.956 --> 25:28.990
We've notified the authorities,
flagged her passport.

25:29.058 --> 25:31.092
She's a ghost.
She cannot be a spy.

25:31.160 --> 25:33.428
This is a woman who made me
toll house cookies.

25:33.495 --> 25:34.829
Okay, I know what
I'm supposed to tell you

25:34.896 --> 25:36.363
in this situation.

25:36.431 --> 25:39.400
I'm supposed to tell you
to let Joan run her op.

25:39.468 --> 25:42.237
I am not supposed to tell you
to go down to the annex

25:42.304 --> 25:43.772
and investigate
for yourself.

25:43.840 --> 25:45.508
And I'm definitely
not supposed to tell you

25:45.575 --> 25:49.879
that the code for the door
is 9-2-7-6-2 pound.

26:38.360 --> 26:41.795
Smithsonian Institution.
How may I direct your call?

26:41.863 --> 26:44.465
We have Danielle Brooks
at the Smithsonian

26:44.532 --> 26:45.933
looking for Annie Walker.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.268
Okay. Send her down
to the castle.

26:48.336 --> 26:51.104
I'll be right over.

26:51.172 --> 26:53.273
And his supervisor sent me
to the national gallery.

26:53.341 --> 26:55.142
So I trudged all the way
across the mall,

26:55.210 --> 26:56.476
waited there
another 20 minutes,

26:56.544 --> 26:57.778
and then was told
I had to come back here

26:57.845 --> 26:59.480
where I started
two hours ago!

26:59.547 --> 27:01.082
And who are you
looking for again?

27:01.150 --> 27:04.385
Annie...Walker!

27:04.453 --> 27:06.754
That was
the first thing I said.

27:08.323 --> 27:10.758
Auggie Anderson?
Danielle Brooks.

27:10.826 --> 27:12.427
You gave my daughter's
third-grade class

27:12.494 --> 27:15.130
the most amazing tour.
Right! Yeah, sure.

27:15.197 --> 27:17.732
Annie Walker's sister. Hey.
Yeah, actually I feel

27:17.800 --> 27:19.534
more like Annie Walker's
casual acquaintance.

27:19.601 --> 27:21.903
Can't even find my sister
in her office.

27:21.971 --> 27:23.737
Yeah, the bureaucracy
around here is crazy.

27:23.805 --> 27:25.272
Unfortunately,
Annie's out of the office.

27:25.340 --> 27:26.841
She has an
acquisitions conference.

27:26.908 --> 27:29.343
Oh, no, she said
that was yesterday.

27:29.411 --> 27:31.345
It's a week-long thing.
It's a big deal around here.

27:31.413 --> 27:32.847
It's kind of like
our Fashion Week.

27:32.915 --> 27:34.249
I tell you what.

27:34.316 --> 27:36.417
Can I buy you one
of the Smithsonian's

27:36.485 --> 27:38.353
famously bad cups
of coffee?

27:38.421 --> 27:40.855
That sounds wonderful.

27:40.923 --> 27:43.191
At least someone
around here is helpful.

27:44.360 --> 27:45.860
Follow me.

27:56.973 --> 28:00.742
You know it's bad luck
to read in a bar, don't you?

28:00.809 --> 28:02.243
You're wasting
your time.

28:02.311 --> 28:04.946
I have a rule against
dating Indian men.

28:05.014 --> 28:06.715
Fine.

28:06.783 --> 28:08.885
If you ask me,
you're the one wasting time.

28:08.952 --> 28:11.920
I mean, we both know
how the charade plays out.

28:33.710 --> 28:36.112
Wh-where could you
possibly be going

28:36.179 --> 28:38.014
that's more fun than this?
Everything's more fun

28:38.081 --> 28:39.382
with champagne.

28:47.225 --> 28:49.493
- Tech intel.
- I'm in.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.562
Dude, are you
eating a sandwich?

28:51.630 --> 28:53.164
They ordered Wagshals.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.599
Whatever.
Just take me through this.

28:55.667 --> 28:59.303
Okay, set her Bluetooth
to discoverable.

28:59.370 --> 29:03.140
Then open "Spiral attack"
from your phone.

29:03.208 --> 29:05.042
Enter her
I.M.E.I. number.

29:05.110 --> 29:07.545
Then star, 7, 6,
send.

29:07.613 --> 29:10.781
And...

29:10.849 --> 29:12.383
We're done.
There you go.

29:12.450 --> 29:13.850
It'll take a day
to drill down these names,

29:13.918 --> 29:15.686
but your end
of the mission is done.

29:15.753 --> 29:18.455
You can just go home, lucky.
Yeah.

29:18.523 --> 29:19.823
Actually, I think
I'm gonna stick around

29:19.891 --> 29:21.459
for a little bit.
Why? What are you--

29:21.526 --> 29:22.727
Hello?

29:24.931 --> 29:26.598
What'd I miss?

29:27.967 --> 29:29.235
So you really think
I shouldn't be

29:29.302 --> 29:30.936
worried about Annie?
Yeah, she'll be fine.

29:31.004 --> 29:32.572
We're just in the middle
of our busy season.

29:32.639 --> 29:34.807
Well, she's always in
the middle of a busy season.

29:34.875 --> 29:38.544
D'you know she canceled
on Scott three times last week?

29:38.612 --> 29:41.347
Scott, the doctor
she's been seeing?

29:41.414 --> 29:44.016
Oh, right.
Dr. Scott.

29:44.084 --> 29:45.384
There's a table.
Do you want to sit down?

29:45.451 --> 29:46.985
Sure.

29:48.921 --> 29:50.321
I'm just worried
that she's pushing

29:50.389 --> 29:52.690
everyone
she's close to away.

29:52.758 --> 29:55.226
Well, your concern
is completely natural.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.594
My brother
was worried about me

29:56.662 --> 29:58.630
when I first joined
the institution too.

29:58.698 --> 30:01.400
The thing you have to realize
is that this isn't just a job.

30:01.468 --> 30:02.801
It's a way of life.

30:02.869 --> 30:04.870
The Smithsonian?

30:04.938 --> 30:06.439
It's one of the pillars
of our country.

30:06.506 --> 30:08.240
We are out there
on the front lines,

30:08.308 --> 30:11.445
protecting
America's art.

30:11.512 --> 30:13.013
Art that is
under attack.

30:13.081 --> 30:15.616
- Who's attacking art?
- Funding cutters.

30:15.684 --> 30:17.584
And the only thing
standing between them

30:17.652 --> 30:20.287
and total annihilation
is the Smithsonian.

30:20.354 --> 30:21.888
It's the first line
of defense.

30:21.956 --> 30:23.522
Defense of the art?

30:23.590 --> 30:25.524
Metaphorically speaking,
of course.

30:25.592 --> 30:27.259
Look, this is
a very demanding job

30:27.327 --> 30:29.828
for the people who work in it
<i>and</i> for their families,

30:29.896 --> 30:32.830
with the long hours,
the travel, the confidentiality.

30:32.898 --> 30:35.666
Your sister has devoted
her life to public service,

30:35.734 --> 30:37.335
and at the end
of the day,

30:37.403 --> 30:39.003
that's what makes it
all worthwhile.

30:39.071 --> 30:40.438
Wow.

30:40.506 --> 30:43.575
I had no idea so much
went into working in a museum.

30:43.643 --> 30:46.879
Well, it's not just
a museum, Danielle.

30:46.947 --> 30:48.614
It's <i>the</i> museum.

31:18.580 --> 31:20.414
Safia?

31:27.355 --> 31:29.857
Safia, it's Annie!

31:36.031 --> 31:38.232
Safia!

31:49.491 --> 31:50.691
Why are you
following me?

31:50.759 --> 31:53.027
Why can't you just
leave me alone?

31:53.094 --> 31:55.128
Safia.

31:55.196 --> 31:58.498
I need you
to put the gun down.

31:58.566 --> 32:00.133
I came here
as a friend.

32:00.201 --> 32:02.302
You came here
to find Mark's files.

32:02.370 --> 32:05.839
You're not a friend.
You're a spy.

32:05.907 --> 32:09.376
Put the gun down
before you hurt us both.

32:14.350 --> 32:17.018
You can trust me.

32:17.086 --> 32:19.888
I don't know
who I can trust anymore.

32:19.956 --> 32:23.292
Maybe we can work
that out together.

32:30.367 --> 32:32.268
When you told me Mark
had this whole other life,

32:32.336 --> 32:34.537
it made me
question everything.

32:34.605 --> 32:38.507
I mean, I wondered whether
he ever loved me at all.

32:38.575 --> 32:41.777
And then everything
became clear in one moment.

32:41.845 --> 32:44.446
- The safety deposit box.
- And that's when I realized,

32:44.514 --> 32:48.150
in spite of everything
he hid from me...

32:48.218 --> 32:50.119
I was always
in his heart.

32:50.187 --> 32:52.589
So you took the vows,
and you fled.

32:55.593 --> 32:58.229
We came to North Haven
every summer.

32:58.296 --> 33:02.900
No matter how busy we got,
this was our oasis.

33:02.968 --> 33:07.238
That's why he didn't file
this house with the Agency.

33:07.306 --> 33:09.874
He wanted it to be
just between you.

33:12.978 --> 33:14.212
The last time
I saw Mark,

33:14.279 --> 33:16.447
he told me not
to join the Agency.

33:18.617 --> 33:22.420
I didn't understand why
until just now.

33:22.488 --> 33:25.256
It's not easy
deceiving people,

33:25.324 --> 33:26.891
especially
the people you love.

33:26.959 --> 33:28.759
And Mark didn't
want me to suffer

33:28.827 --> 33:32.230
through a lifetime
of lying.

33:36.936 --> 33:39.972
Do you still have
those vows?

33:40.040 --> 33:41.307
Sure.

33:57.023 --> 33:59.224
♪ ♪

34:08.467 --> 34:11.503
Look.

34:11.570 --> 34:14.206
Mark was trying to transmit
that brief to the C.I.A.

34:14.273 --> 34:16.275
He was killed before
he ever got the chance.

34:16.342 --> 34:18.610
But why would he hide this
on our wedding vows?

34:18.678 --> 34:20.446
He must've sensed that it
wasn't safe in the house,

34:20.514 --> 34:22.915
so he put it in that box,
and he put it on a document

34:22.983 --> 34:24.750
that no one
would suspect.

34:24.818 --> 34:28.353
If anything happened to him,
he wanted the exact right person

34:28.420 --> 34:30.422
to find it.

34:34.494 --> 34:37.929
I think he wanted it
to be you.

34:44.135 --> 34:46.637
We need to take this
to Langley.

34:46.705 --> 34:50.107
Arthur.

34:50.175 --> 34:52.842
Why am I just finding out
you re-tasked four

34:52.911 --> 34:55.579
of my field officers
to the Ramsay investigation?

34:55.647 --> 34:57.581
I don't get it. We've drilled
down on every assignment

34:57.649 --> 35:01.017
Ramsay ever worked.
We vetted every asset.

35:01.085 --> 35:03.621
What are we missing?

35:03.688 --> 35:06.791
Don't do this.

35:06.859 --> 35:09.828
Do what?

35:09.895 --> 35:12.765
You are more involved
with this investigation

35:12.832 --> 35:16.703
than I have seen you
in years.

35:16.770 --> 35:19.038
You and Ramsay both
graduated from Annapolis.

35:19.106 --> 35:20.874
You both cut your teeth
in the D.I.,

35:20.941 --> 35:23.710
and by all appearances,
you seem to share

35:23.778 --> 35:25.512
a similar taste
in historical fiction.

35:27.815 --> 35:30.749
I think you're worried
this could've been you.

35:30.817 --> 35:34.553
Oh, I'm not worried
about me.

35:34.620 --> 35:36.321
I'm worried about you.

35:36.389 --> 35:38.356
I'm worried
about our team.

35:38.424 --> 35:39.924
This happened
in our backyard.

35:39.992 --> 35:42.393
I'm not gonna rest
till we catch these guys.

36:01.115 --> 36:03.484
I cross-referenced
Rubina Jafari's contacts

36:03.551 --> 36:05.786
with Ramsay's
known associates.

36:05.853 --> 36:07.421
Tommy Burleigh.

36:07.488 --> 36:09.489
Studies nuclear physics
at Georgetown.

36:09.557 --> 36:11.291
Took three language classes
with Ramsay.

36:11.358 --> 36:12.826
He has
top-secret clearance

36:12.893 --> 36:14.728
and access
to sensitive D.O.E. Labs.

36:14.795 --> 36:16.462
Ideal target
for <i>Lashkar</i> recruitment.

36:16.530 --> 36:18.764
Mm-hmm. And his
sizeable student loans,

36:18.832 --> 36:20.532
suspiciously
paid off last year.

36:20.600 --> 36:23.101
Ramsay must've sniffed out
he was selling info to <i>Lashkar.</i>

36:23.169 --> 36:25.336
And <i>Lashkar</i> had him killed
before he could get out word.

36:25.404 --> 36:27.172
You have to tell Annie.

36:27.240 --> 36:29.308

Her cell's out of range.

36:32.579 --> 36:36.616
Annie, look who I found.
You met Tommy, right?

36:36.684 --> 36:38.752
It's an awful strange
coincidence,

36:38.819 --> 36:41.288
running into each other
on a remote island in Maine.

36:41.356 --> 36:44.758
Yes, well,
Mark and Safia

36:44.826 --> 36:47.494
would wax poetic about
their respites to North Haven,

36:47.562 --> 36:49.229
so I thought I'd take
a couple of days

36:49.296 --> 36:51.698
to clear my head.

36:51.765 --> 36:53.299
Where's your luggage?

36:55.001 --> 36:56.368
And your shoes
are pretty clean

36:56.436 --> 36:57.836
for the middle
of mud season.

36:57.904 --> 37:01.307
Tommy,
what's going on?

37:01.374 --> 37:03.609
Please, Safia,
you have to help me.

37:03.677 --> 37:06.144
- Hey. Hey!
- Safia, they're gonna kill me!

37:06.212 --> 37:08.914
Annie!

37:08.982 --> 37:10.750
Tommy must've worked
with the men who killed Mark.

37:10.818 --> 37:12.785

38:33.442 --> 38:36.144
Ramsay's microdot confirmed
the identity and locations

38:36.212 --> 38:38.047
of seven
<i>Lashkar</i> operatives.

38:38.114 --> 38:39.515
Tommy Burleigh
and Malik Murabahti

38:39.582 --> 38:40.949
were picked up
by the Coast Guard.

38:41.017 --> 38:42.350
That leaves five
still at large.

38:42.418 --> 38:44.652
Mm-hmm. So what's
the next move?

38:44.720 --> 38:47.455
Conventional wisdom says
we slowly squeeze the lemon.

38:47.522 --> 38:49.256
Bring all seven in, turn them,
and send them back out

38:49.323 --> 38:51.224
to catch bigger fish.

38:51.292 --> 38:52.725

It's my job
to support it,

38:54.194 --> 38:56.762
so the more relevant
question is,

38:56.830 --> 38:59.465
what do you think
is the move?

38:59.532 --> 39:02.835
I don't think we use
killers as chess pieces.

39:02.902 --> 39:04.537
I want them

But I'm glad
that's your call,

39:13.146 --> 39:14.981
because that's what
I was hoping you'd say.

39:18.852 --> 39:22.521
Today we've gathered
for our most solemn occasion--

39:22.589 --> 39:25.090
unveiling a new star
on our wall of honor.

39:25.158 --> 39:28.961
Each of these 103 stars
represents the memory

39:29.029 --> 39:32.265
of a devoted
intelligence operative,

39:32.333 --> 39:36.035
a treasured colleague,
a beloved friend.

39:36.103 --> 39:37.804
It is our job
at the Agency

39:37.872 --> 39:40.540
to honor these men and women by
continuing to serve the country

39:40.608 --> 39:43.877
they gave their lives
to protect.

Case Officer Mark Ramsay

39:47.249 --> 39:49.551

men who posed
a significant threat

39:53.222 --> 39:54.757

39:54.824 --> 39:58.160
This is the culmination
of a distinguished career,

39:58.228 --> 40:00.329
one marked by devotion,

40:00.396 --> 40:03.665
sacrifice,
