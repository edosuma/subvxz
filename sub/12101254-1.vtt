WEBVTT

00:39.748 --> 00:40.874
What's wrong?

00:41.750 --> 00:44.002
- Where's Jason, have you seen him?

00:50.467 --> 00:51.301
Your mom tells me

00:51.301 --> 00:52.927
you keep bugging her about stories.

00:58.725 --> 01:01.394
I can tell you stories.

01:01.394 --> 01:05.398
I can tell
you plenty of stories, Anok.

01:29.005 --> 01:32.592
Jason, Jason, are you home?

01:33.802 --> 01:36.554
I know right now, you would
not believe

01:36.554 --> 01:41.434
First of all, those
cigarettes

01:46.856 --> 01:47.941
Our home we called back

01:47.941 --> 01:52.695
in the Philippines, it
was a beautiful place.

01:52.695 --> 01:57.700
Every sunset was the most
beautiful sunset you've ever seen.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.160
It was...

02:53.131 --> 02:54.966
I'll take you back there if you want.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.429
I have to save enough money first,

03:00.346 --> 03:02.182
but I'll take you camping back home.

03:16.779 --> 03:18.198
Well, Anok, what do you say?

03:52.649 --> 03:53.483
Wake up!

04:33.314 --> 04:35.358
The first thing you
notice when you're there

04:35.358 --> 04:37.068
are the mornings.

04:37.068 --> 04:40.196
They feel so quiet, even if it's not.

04:44.867 --> 04:47.870
You enjoy that little
bit of peace, that quiet,

04:47.870 --> 04:51.332
because I promise you it never lasts.

05:50.808 --> 05:55.563
The Philippines is a small
country, but it's a big place.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.982
I lived there 33 years.

05:57.982 --> 05:59.025
And you know what?

05:59.984 --> 06:01.194
I still got lost.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.830
Just always remember, when you're lost

06:12.830 --> 06:14.665
just turn around and go back.

07:43.004 --> 07:47.008
Another thing I can tell
you, Anok, is to be careful.

07:47.008 --> 07:49.719
You can take a lot of
things from the forest,

07:49.719 --> 07:54.724
wood, food, but you have
to always ask permission

07:55.141 --> 07:57.477
from whatever is living there.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.855
And you have to watch your
step because you never know

08:00.855 --> 08:03.191
if you're stepping on someone's home.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.025
- Ah!

08:28.674 --> 08:31.260
Small, invisible dwarves
that likes to steal

08:31.260 --> 08:33.513
small little things around the house.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.139
Naughty little monsters.

08:36.557 --> 08:37.850
They are mostly harmless.

08:39.977 --> 08:40.811
Mostly.

09:21.644 --> 09:24.230
But the most dangerous
things in the forest

09:24.230 --> 09:25.565
are not the monsters.

09:40.705 --> 09:43.958
No, they're the ones who
look exactly like us.

09:45.459 --> 09:48.170
Men and women, so beautiful people are

09:48.170 --> 09:50.256
lost forever chasing after them.

09:51.632 --> 09:53.926
If we ever see one,
Anok, remember one thing.

09:57.847 --> 10:00.224
Do not follow them.

11:25.976 --> 11:27.019
- Oh, oh god.

11:27.937 --> 11:30.981
Please, please I wasn't
trying anything, I swear.

11:35.653 --> 11:36.487
Huh?

11:38.364 --> 11:43.369
I'm sorry, I can't understand what you're.

12:03.013 --> 12:04.181
No, no, don't!

12:10.771 --> 12:12.648
That's where I'm from, Canada.

12:19.739 --> 12:20.865
Canada.

12:20.865 --> 12:21.699
- Canada.

12:23.159 --> 12:23.993
- Canada.

12:25.119 --> 12:29.290
- Canada.

12:32.460 --> 12:33.294
- Close enough.

12:40.634 --> 12:41.594
No, no!

12:45.890 --> 12:46.766
I'm sorry, I don't under--

12:47.683 --> 12:48.809
I don't know what you're talking about.

12:49.643 --> 12:51.103
No, I don't, I swear.

12:51.103 --> 12:53.063
Please don't hurt me, please.

12:53.063 --> 12:56.984
Please, please, please,
please, please, please.

13:17.296 --> 13:18.672
Wait, wait, you're hurt.

13:19.507 --> 13:20.716
You can't be walking around with that

13:20.716 --> 13:21.967
sticking out of your leg.

13:26.806 --> 13:27.765
What are you doing?

13:58.379 --> 14:00.214
Oh god, oh god.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.715
Hey, hey, hey!

14:01.715 --> 14:02.967
Over here, over here!

14:04.426 --> 14:05.928
Look, we need to get her to a hospital.

14:05.928 --> 14:06.887
I think she's hurt.

14:08.305 --> 14:09.265
Come on, help me.

14:10.808 --> 14:13.352
Hey, where you going?

14:13.352 --> 14:16.313
Hey, at least tell me
where the nearest town is.

14:17.565 --> 14:18.941
Where did I work?

14:19.859 --> 14:22.611
Well, there was plenty of work.

14:23.696 --> 14:27.116
I once managed this coconut oil mill,

14:27.116 --> 14:29.159
but it didn't matter what you made.

14:29.159 --> 14:30.661
People wanted to buy it.

14:31.579 --> 14:32.621
Business was good.

15:18.292 --> 15:20.252
- Please tell me you can see her.

15:34.808 --> 15:37.853
I need brown bottle, now.

15:37.853 --> 15:41.899
- Brown bottle, brown
bottle, brown bottle.

15:41.899 --> 15:42.733
Okay.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.360
- Wrong brown bottle.

15:49.990 --> 15:51.200
Brown bottle!

15:51.200 --> 15:52.326
- Here, here.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.036
- That's wrong brown bottle!

15:54.036 --> 15:54.995
- They're all brown.

15:54.995 --> 15:55.829
- Wrong brown bottle!

15:55.829 --> 15:57.498
- They're all brown!

16:07.758 --> 16:09.009
- Brown bottle!

16:12.763 --> 16:14.515
Ah, yeah, thank you very much.

16:14.515 --> 16:15.432
Hold, hold.

16:52.177 --> 16:53.012
Oh.

17:30.132 --> 17:31.216
- Yeah, yeah.

17:36.263 --> 17:37.598
- What your name?

17:39.892 --> 17:41.226
- Jason.

17:41.226 --> 17:42.061
- Mm-hmm.

17:44.146 --> 17:49.109
Me, you call me Batibat.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.236
Letter B as in victory.

17:59.286 --> 18:00.412
Americano ah?

18:00.412 --> 18:01.413
- Canadian.

18:01.413 --> 18:02.247
Oh!

18:02.247 --> 18:04.124
- Common mistake, that's all right.

18:04.124 --> 18:05.876
- Oh, Canada.

18:05.876 --> 18:07.419
I don't want to go there, very cold.

18:12.216 --> 18:13.592
- Why can't people see her?

18:13.592 --> 18:14.593
- Third eye.

18:14.593 --> 18:15.469
- Huh?

18:15.469 --> 18:16.303
- Third eye.

18:16.303 --> 18:18.388
You see things other people don't.

18:19.598 --> 18:20.974
You see her.

18:20.974 --> 18:22.684
Where did you find her?

18:22.684 --> 18:24.269
- Just here and there.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.188
- You know, when I was little girl,

18:26.188 --> 18:28.190
I used to live near volcano.

18:28.190 --> 18:31.735
And then I realized I see
things other people don't.

18:32.569 --> 18:34.988
I'd have to stay awake in the night

18:40.244 --> 18:41.078
smoking in the tree.

18:41.078 --> 18:42.329
Then they're standing around the tall,

18:42.329 --> 18:43.789
running around the house.

18:43.789 --> 18:47.167
And then when there's a great boom.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.215
But me?

18:53.215 --> 18:55.759
I would like to wait for
that special someone.

18:57.511 --> 18:59.388
When everything is quiet.

19:00.472 --> 19:03.851
Even the insects, even the birds, gone.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.938
I know she's here.

19:09.064 --> 19:10.274
Magayon is here.

19:12.901 --> 19:14.069
You mean her?

19:21.410 --> 19:22.244
- Her.

19:34.631 --> 19:36.550
- Well what is she?

19:36.550 --> 19:38.385
- Ha, look at you now!

19:39.803 --> 19:41.972
She used to be a princess.

19:44.766 --> 19:47.352
People come here to meet her,

19:47.352 --> 19:51.106
asking to marry her, but that is one.

19:51.106 --> 19:53.817
And this, there is one, one, one thing.

19:53.817 --> 19:54.651
You know.

19:55.485 --> 19:58.906
Pagtuga, name Pagtuga.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.449
Is very jealous, see?

20:01.658 --> 20:03.243
Very angry.

20:03.243 --> 20:07.206
And then one day there is
one foreigner come here.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.999
His name is Ulap.

20:08.999 --> 20:12.419
He and Magayon meet in the lake.

20:12.419 --> 20:13.921
They fall in love.

20:15.672 --> 20:17.799
And then Pagtuga heard about it.

20:17.799 --> 20:19.092
Pagtuga fight Ulap, Ulap fight Pagtuga!

20:20.385 --> 20:21.595
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

20:21.595 --> 20:22.512
Magayon said, "Stop!"

20:22.512 --> 20:26.350
Nobody sees me because of that, men die.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.227
And then one day, fight, fight, fight.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.102
Fight, fight, fight.

20:29.102 --> 20:30.520
Fight, fight, fight.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.314
Magayon got hit.

20:32.314 --> 20:33.148
- She died?

20:33.148 --> 20:34.024
- Of course!

20:34.024 --> 20:36.693
Why, you foreigner get stuck by a knife,

20:36.693 --> 20:37.694
you will not die?

20:40.948 --> 20:42.532
Anyway.

20:42.532 --> 20:45.202
You know that the daga, the lupa.

20:46.745 --> 20:47.871
They buried Magayon.

20:48.914 --> 20:53.669
They buried her, everybody
sad, everybody's lonely.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.629
Everybody's crying.

20:55.629 --> 21:00.259
But the place, it got bigger, bigger.

21:02.302 --> 21:03.136
It grows.

21:04.513 --> 21:06.807
It grows a very beautiful mountain.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.227
Magayon Volcano.

21:12.896 --> 21:15.315
They say, hello?

21:16.733 --> 21:17.693
Sister lives there.

21:20.320 --> 21:24.574
You should bring her home.

21:38.338 --> 21:39.589
Bring her home!

22:48.950 --> 22:51.870
Jason, Jason.

23:10.555 --> 23:11.390
Here.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.460
What are you waiting for?

25:48.296 --> 25:49.130
- Canada.

25:50.465 --> 25:51.716
Canada's fine, look we have to go.

25:51.716 --> 25:54.219
All right, no touching,
no touching, I gotta...

25:54.219 --> 25:55.220
Look, I'm just trying to help.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.097
I'm not trying to hurt you, okay?

26:23.123 --> 26:24.082
I know one fact

26:24.082 --> 26:25.792
that will always be true.

26:26.751 --> 26:31.256
Filipino women are the most
beautiful women in the world.

26:33.508 --> 26:35.135
They're also the hardest to woo.

26:40.473 --> 26:43.852
First thing you must
learn, you cannot be shy.

26:53.987 --> 26:54.904
Just give me a minute.

26:54.904 --> 26:57.324
Second, you must know how to

26:57.324 --> 26:58.700
read her signals.

27:12.505 --> 27:14.966
Third, you will learn fast

27:14.966 --> 27:16.926
whether she likes you back or not.

27:26.436 --> 27:27.437
- My volcano.

27:44.621 --> 27:45.789
That's me in the middle.

27:47.374 --> 27:49.459
My dad, he was from here.

27:51.670 --> 27:54.422
I'm guessing that's where
you need to go, right?

27:54.422 --> 27:55.715
Home?

27:55.715 --> 27:56.800
To the very top.

27:57.759 --> 28:00.470
And I'm guessing the guy
back there was what, Pagtuga?

28:01.763 --> 28:03.556
Pagtuga.

28:03.556 --> 28:05.183
- Exactly, Pagtuga.

28:06.559 --> 28:07.977
I'm guessing he's after you?

28:09.187 --> 28:11.564
I'm guessing you wanna get back home?

28:13.733 --> 28:14.567
I wanna help.

28:17.404 --> 28:18.238
- Canada.

28:26.788 --> 28:28.123
- Is that a yes?

28:42.178 --> 28:44.681
Boy,
I know women can be scary,

28:44.681 --> 28:46.474
but do not give up.

28:49.018 --> 28:49.853
Ever!

28:52.689 --> 28:56.443
But if you do, well you
know, I get that too.

29:47.827 --> 29:48.620
- Hey!

29:52.499 --> 29:53.333
Magayon.

30:00.673 --> 30:02.091
Magayon, wait up!

30:28.326 --> 30:29.702
Thanks for not leaving me back there.

30:36.918 --> 30:40.672
So, um, I think we should
get out of this jungle.

30:40.672 --> 30:44.175
Just find our bearings, then
find, find the volcano, right?

30:44.175 --> 30:45.844
And then we could...

30:48.137 --> 30:50.932
Unless, you know, you already
know where you're going.

30:51.891 --> 30:52.725
- Canada.

30:52.725 --> 30:53.560
- Huh?

30:56.604 --> 30:57.564
- Of course you do.

31:08.366 --> 31:09.242
Hey, hey!

31:26.342 --> 31:29.137
When
I was young, I was in love

31:29.137 --> 31:30.805
with this beautiful woman.

31:32.724 --> 31:37.729
I chased after her, tried to
walk her home every night.

31:39.105 --> 31:41.733
She was just so beautiful.

31:41.733 --> 31:44.736
I did this for 10 years before finally

31:46.154 --> 31:47.739
she broke my heart.

31:49.365 --> 31:53.077
And not long after that, I
met and married your mom.

31:55.747 --> 31:58.750
Sometimes beauty is dangerous, Anok.

32:00.710 --> 32:03.296
Sometimes love can make you hold on

32:03.296 --> 32:06.007
when everything else is
telling you to let go.

33:27.755 --> 33:29.924
Remember to always ask permission.

33:29.924 --> 33:32.510
Wherever you walk, ask for permission.

33:32.510 --> 33:33.845
If you're going to dig something

33:33.845 --> 33:37.223
or cut down something,
remember ask for permission.

33:40.143 --> 33:41.602
What did I just say?

33:42.729 --> 33:43.563
- Oh!

33:44.647 --> 33:46.399
Ah!

33:47.775 --> 33:49.944
Hey, okay, okay.

37:09.477 --> 37:10.978
No, no, no, stop, stop, stop!

37:10.978 --> 37:11.896
Ow, ow, ah!

37:15.107 --> 37:17.902
Stop, stop, no, look, it's just a phone!

37:17.902 --> 37:19.028
It's harmless.

37:20.112 --> 37:22.073
My mom, it's my mom, it's my mom!

37:22.949 --> 37:23.783
She's gone.

37:39.340 --> 37:41.759
I should probably answer her, my mom.

37:44.720 --> 37:46.347
We're not on the best of terms right now,

37:46.347 --> 37:48.432
but I'm sure she's worried sick about me.

38:02.697 --> 38:04.532
I have a hard time sleeping at night.

38:05.908 --> 38:08.160
I go through the same
thing every single day,

38:09.287 --> 38:11.998
come home exhausted
and I just fall asleep.

38:11.998 --> 38:14.000
Next thing you know, three hours later

38:14.000 --> 38:15.001
you're still awake.

38:17.295 --> 38:18.713
And you're questioning every single choice

38:18.713 --> 38:20.214
you've ever made in your life.

38:21.507 --> 38:23.634
Sometimes, though, I
do get to fall asleep.

38:24.844 --> 38:27.138
But then I wake up in
the middle of the night.

38:29.056 --> 38:31.392
Although I wouldn't call it being awake.

38:31.392 --> 38:34.812
It's, it's weird, it's uh, kinda like,

38:36.564 --> 38:38.357
I can't feel my legs.

38:38.357 --> 38:42.278
My arms, my chest, it feels heavy.

38:42.278 --> 38:45.990
it's weird.

38:45.990 --> 38:50.328
Strange thing is, I kinda
always feel that there's

38:50.328 --> 38:52.413
something in the room and I'm not alone.

38:57.668 --> 38:59.170
My dad used to tell me all of these

38:59.170 --> 39:00.629
Filipino ghost stories.

39:01.839 --> 39:04.425
There was this monster
that feeds on your fears

39:04.425 --> 39:08.471
and anxiety and insecurities,
and it follows you around.

39:08.471 --> 39:10.765
And it waits 'til you fall asleep,

39:12.516 --> 39:13.893
and that's when it strikes.

39:16.020 --> 39:19.482
Suddenly it starts sucking
the life out of you.

39:19.482 --> 39:23.444
And eventually, the morning after,

39:23.444 --> 39:26.113
they'll find you there, dead.

39:31.535 --> 39:32.787
I know it's just the story,

39:32.787 --> 39:35.456
but sometimes I think
that's how my dad died.

39:39.794 --> 39:41.545
My dad, he was a doctor here.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.297
Everybody knew him.

39:44.715 --> 39:48.135
Back in Canada, though, he was a janitor

39:48.135 --> 39:52.139
during the weekdays, cargo
man on the weeknights.

39:55.476 --> 39:57.395
We could tell that he wasn't happy.

40:00.481 --> 40:03.859
My mom, she was the one
who convinced him to leave.

40:07.696 --> 40:11.784
And I guess a part of
my dad kinda regretted

40:11.784 --> 40:12.993
ever leaving this place.

40:17.164 --> 40:18.249
I kinda get why.

41:36.619 --> 41:37.953
- Canada!

41:37.953 --> 41:39.288
What?

41:39.288 --> 41:40.122
- Sh!

41:45.628 --> 41:48.047
Magayon, Magayon!

41:50.591 --> 41:51.425
Magayon!

41:55.596 --> 41:56.430
Magayon!

42:19.203 --> 42:20.037
Magayon!

42:38.347 --> 42:39.181
Magayon!

43:06.458 --> 43:08.002
I
used to believe in giants.

43:09.461 --> 43:12.590
My grandfather used to tell
me never to leave the house

43:12.590 --> 43:13.841
during earthquakes because the Bungisngis

43:13.841 --> 43:16.760
would come and steal our cows.

43:20.097 --> 43:23.267
I would go out to look,
but I could never see them.

43:24.476 --> 43:25.561
I didn't have the third eye like he did.

43:27.896 --> 43:29.148
But could you believe it?

43:31.275 --> 43:32.901
Giants!

43:40.075 --> 43:41.952
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

43:41.952 --> 43:43.454
Wake up, wake up.

43:43.454 --> 43:45.539
We gotta get out of here.

43:46.373 --> 43:48.375
Let me start this thing.

43:50.127 --> 43:51.170
My grandfather said

43:51.170 --> 43:52.921
they mostly left us alone.

43:55.341 --> 43:58.469
Unless they fall in love
with a beautiful woman.

43:58.469 --> 44:00.262
- Come on, please.

44:00.262 --> 44:01.930
Come on!

44:06.393 --> 44:07.478
Start, start!

44:17.905 --> 44:20.491
Come on, come, come on, faster.

44:20.491 --> 44:21.575
Move faster, please!

44:23.744 --> 44:26.747
Oh!

44:48.977 --> 44:51.021
What's it doing?

44:51.021 --> 44:52.523
Is it still there?

45:00.197 --> 45:01.407
Okay, okay!

45:01.407 --> 45:04.368
I think we lost him, I think--

45:09.832 --> 45:11.375
What the fuck!

45:27.891 --> 45:31.145
No, no, no, no, no, no, not now, not now!

45:31.145 --> 45:31.979
Come on!

45:52.249 --> 45:54.501
I can't swim, I can't swim!

47:58.250 --> 48:00.752
- Canada, Canada.

49:17.162 --> 49:18.413
- Sorry, sorry.

49:19.748 --> 49:21.416
It's okay, I forgot.

50:01.123 --> 50:02.290
You all right?

50:34.322 --> 50:38.452
So um, I'm thinking if we
walk through the night,

50:38.452 --> 50:40.662
we'll probably get to
the base in the morning.

50:50.338 --> 50:52.132
What are you looking at?

50:59.222 --> 51:00.724
I could get used to this view.

51:07.439 --> 51:09.316
Sometimes,
Anok, it's just better

51:09.316 --> 51:10.400
to let go.

51:10.400 --> 51:11.610
- Magayon, hey, Magayon!

52:20.262 --> 52:22.222
- Good morning, Sunshine!

52:22.222 --> 52:23.598
You from America?

52:23.598 --> 52:25.725
- Canada, common mistake.

52:31.898 --> 52:34.442
- So, why so far away?

52:34.442 --> 52:36.820
- Oh you know, I just wanted to get away.

52:36.820 --> 52:38.238
- Get away?

52:38.238 --> 52:40.115
This place, it's so dangerous here.

52:40.115 --> 52:41.992
You don't know what is living out here.

52:41.992 --> 52:43.160
- Yeah, like what?

52:43.160 --> 52:44.953
- Like sometimes I find footprints.

52:46.246 --> 52:47.414
There are footprints.

52:47.414 --> 52:49.624
One time I find one big footprint.

52:49.624 --> 52:52.210
You don't know imagine how big it is.

52:52.210 --> 52:53.962
- I don't think I can.

52:53.962 --> 52:57.132
You don't believe me.

52:57.132 --> 52:58.717
- No, I do.

52:58.717 --> 53:01.636
- Remember, better believe
than not to believe.

53:03.805 --> 53:06.308
One time I have this very good friend.

53:08.393 --> 53:09.477
Fish.

53:09.477 --> 53:10.437
Fish?

53:10.437 --> 53:11.229
- Yes, fish.

53:15.275 --> 53:17.402
They come by to see, but they only

53:19.946 --> 53:20.780
In the lake.

53:21.990 --> 53:23.491
I told my friend, my friend.

53:27.621 --> 53:29.706
But my friend did not believe me.

53:29.706 --> 53:30.665
He did not listen.

53:32.375 --> 53:34.294
One time, he hungry.

53:36.796 --> 53:38.548
He bring it home, he cook it.

53:40.300 --> 53:41.676
He cook it for his family.

53:43.011 --> 53:44.596
They ate it, and his son?

53:45.472 --> 53:49.267
He got, uh, sick, a nightmare.

53:49.267 --> 53:52.062
Then the next day, dead.

53:53.772 --> 53:57.150
So better believe than not to believe.

54:20.632 --> 54:22.092
- Stop the bus!

54:22.092 --> 54:24.135
Magayon, Magayon!

54:24.135 --> 54:25.637
Stop the bus!

54:37.023 --> 54:38.233
Hey, hey, no, no.

54:38.233 --> 54:39.901
We're not ignoring this anymore.

54:39.901 --> 54:40.735
What's going on?

54:45.490 --> 54:46.324
Hey.

54:58.420 --> 54:59.379
Just about right.

55:02.716 --> 55:03.550
Huh?

55:04.551 --> 55:05.760
Not a lot, no.

55:08.888 --> 55:09.723
You can see her?

55:09.723 --> 55:11.391
I see you.

55:12.684 --> 55:13.893
My wife can see, too.

55:19.065 --> 55:21.276
Just like that every
day, almost every day.

55:28.074 --> 55:31.161
Why are you away from home that long?

55:31.161 --> 55:33.038
- Someone's chasing after her.

55:33.038 --> 55:33.872
- Huh?

55:44.132 --> 55:46.176
- Can you, can you help me take her home?

55:46.176 --> 55:47.010
- Oh no, no, no, no.

55:47.010 --> 55:47.844
- What?

55:47.844 --> 55:48.678
- I don't want to get involved.

55:48.678 --> 55:49.637
- Why not?

55:49.637 --> 55:51.765
- No, no, listen.

55:51.765 --> 55:53.350
Magayon, powerful.

55:54.267 --> 55:56.936
Beautiful, but very powerful.

55:56.936 --> 56:00.273
They live their own life in the forest.

56:00.273 --> 56:01.107
You have your own life.

56:01.107 --> 56:03.651
Do not chase them, it will end badly.

56:10.575 --> 56:11.409
- It's broken.

56:11.409 --> 56:12.535
- Yes.

56:12.535 --> 56:17.540
Look, look.

56:19.292 --> 56:21.002
Somebody is waiting for us.

56:54.536 --> 56:55.370
- Ulap.

57:20.562 --> 57:21.688
- Look, look, look, look.

57:21.688 --> 57:23.815
I just want to see her home, okay buddy?

59:58.761 --> 59:59.596
- Hey!

1:00:29.876 --> 1:00:30.710
Oh!

1:00:55.276 --> 1:00:56.402
We're still too heavy.

1:02:41.758 --> 1:02:43.050
What do you think?

1:03:07.784 --> 1:03:10.953
Look, they were going to catch us.

1:03:17.502 --> 1:03:19.337
I couldn't let that happen, okay?

1:03:31.432 --> 1:03:32.975
This place looks pretty cool.

1:03:34.519 --> 1:03:35.478
Your handiwork?

1:03:49.534 --> 1:03:50.952
Oh you like that?

1:03:52.286 --> 1:03:54.664
So, you like it when
I sound like an idiot.

1:03:57.416 --> 1:03:58.751
I can work with that.

1:04:17.937 --> 1:04:20.940
Come on, work with me, give me something.

1:04:29.574 --> 1:04:30.408
Argh!

1:04:32.451 --> 1:04:33.619
Pagtuga angry!

1:04:36.122 --> 1:04:37.874
I love, love, I love.

1:04:47.633 --> 1:04:48.467
Okay.

1:04:51.846 --> 1:04:55.600
Jesus, it's not as if you're
gonna understand me anyway.

1:05:01.689 --> 1:05:03.858
I don't have much
waiting for me back home.

1:05:05.276 --> 1:05:06.903
It's not very easy for me.

1:05:13.367 --> 1:05:17.038
But being here, I kinda get why

1:05:17.038 --> 1:05:21.751
my dad missed this place so much.

1:05:21.751 --> 1:05:23.544
So easy to lose yourself.

1:05:26.547 --> 1:05:31.552
For the first time in a long
time, I can breathe again.

1:07:14.947 --> 1:07:16.365
Stay back, stay back.

1:07:42.850 --> 1:07:45.603
Hey, hey, hey what are you doing?

1:09:05.099 --> 1:09:10.104
Jason,
Jason, Anok, wake up.

1:09:39.592 --> 1:09:42.011
We haven't talked in a while,

1:09:43.637 --> 1:09:48.642
but I need to tell you something.

1:09:49.894 --> 1:09:52.813
Jason, I'm sick.

1:09:55.024 --> 1:09:56.734
Your mom doesn't know yet.

1:09:59.236 --> 1:10:01.322
I don't know if I should tell her.

1:10:07.453 --> 1:10:09.955
I don't how to keep going.

1:10:09.955 --> 1:10:12.458
It's all just lies.

1:10:19.506 --> 1:10:23.844
And monsters in my stories,
they're just that, monsters.

1:10:26.013 --> 1:10:28.474
All of our lives we just end up

1:10:28.474 --> 1:10:30.309
killing ourselves in the end.

1:10:30.309 --> 1:10:31.143
- Magayon!

1:10:33.812 --> 1:10:35.189
Magayon!

1:10:35.189 --> 1:10:37.733
I don't
know, Anok, I just don't.

1:10:37.733 --> 1:10:38.567
- Magayon!

1:10:58.671 --> 1:11:00.089
I don't know if you'll

1:11:00.089 --> 1:11:01.674
answer back in time.

1:11:03.884 --> 1:11:06.679
I know you're busy in the city.

1:11:06.679 --> 1:11:11.684
I just...

1:11:40.421 --> 1:11:43.799
I wanted to say I'm sorry I
won't get to keep my promise.

1:11:51.056 --> 1:11:53.392
Maybe one day you'll do it yourself.

1:11:57.980 --> 1:11:59.023
I hope you do.

1:12:03.444 --> 1:12:07.948
I waited so long to see home again.

1:12:10.617 --> 1:12:13.912
Every time it was a different excuse,

1:12:13.912 --> 1:12:16.623
and now I don't know if I
can even get on a plane.

1:12:35.392 --> 1:12:36.477
I miss it, Anok.

1:12:37.394 --> 1:12:39.605
I see it when I go to sleep.

1:12:41.357 --> 1:12:44.193
My dreams, I still see the mountains,

1:12:44.193 --> 1:12:46.945
the sunset, I smell the grass.

1:12:46.945 --> 1:12:48.989
I can breathe again, Anok.

1:12:48.989 --> 1:12:49.865
- Magayon?

1:12:49.865 --> 1:12:52.576
And
then I wake up in the cold

1:12:52.576 --> 1:12:53.619
in my apartment.

1:12:53.619 --> 1:12:55.079
- Magayon, hey.

1:12:56.497 --> 1:12:58.123
And
I try to go back to sleep

1:12:58.123 --> 1:13:00.542
just to see the mountains again.

1:13:00.542 --> 1:13:03.337
Maybe if I never left, I'd be happier.

1:13:03.337 --> 1:13:04.797
I wish I never left.

1:14:55.782 --> 1:14:56.617
- Magayon!

1:15:57.302 --> 1:15:58.136
Magayon!

1:19:02.487 --> 1:19:04.114
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

1:19:04.114 --> 1:19:05.490
Oh god.

1:19:05.490 --> 1:19:06.908
Oh god, oh god.

1:19:06.908 --> 1:19:09.911
Hey, oh shit, what can I do, oh god.

1:19:10.954 --> 1:19:14.875
Hey, look look look, look at
me, look at me, look at me.

1:19:14.875 --> 1:19:17.210
It's gonna be fine, all right?

1:19:17.210 --> 1:19:19.421
I'm gonna get you fixed up.

1:19:19.421 --> 1:19:20.255
We're we're we're we're gonna patch you up

1:19:20.255 --> 1:19:21.673
and you're gonna be fine.

1:19:26.219 --> 1:19:28.388
Hey, hey, help me carry her.

1:19:28.388 --> 1:19:29.306
Snap out of it!

1:19:30.891 --> 1:19:34.311
It's okay, it's okay, I'm gonna carry you.

1:19:34.311 --> 1:19:36.021
We're gonna fix this, all right?

1:19:42.152 --> 1:19:45.739
Oh shit, oh god.

1:19:45.739 --> 1:19:47.324
Oh no, no, no.

1:19:47.324 --> 1:19:50.494
Come on, hey, hey, no, no, no.

1:19:50.494 --> 1:19:51.912
I'm gonna stay here, gonna sit here,

1:19:51.912 --> 1:19:53.288
I'll sit here, all right?

1:19:53.288 --> 1:19:54.206
Just try one more.

1:20:06.927 --> 1:20:07.761
Huh, no.

1:20:09.679 --> 1:20:12.557
No, no, no, I can do it.

1:20:12.557 --> 1:20:13.558
I can do it, I can do it.

1:20:13.558 --> 1:20:15.727
I can help you, I can help you so much.

1:20:15.727 --> 1:20:18.563
Just don't give up, don't give up, hm?

1:20:18.563 --> 1:20:21.858
I'm gonna try, all right, we'll try again.

1:20:26.446 --> 1:20:27.447
Oh, come on!

1:21:29.050 --> 1:21:29.885
Magayon!

1:22:51.341 --> 1:22:52.175
Yeah.

1:22:54.302 --> 1:22:55.679
Don't worry.

1:22:55.679 --> 1:22:58.264
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

1:22:58.264 --> 1:23:00.892
No, no, don't say

1:23:00.892 --> 1:23:01.768
everything is okay.

1:23:01.768 --> 1:23:03.061
Where the hell have you been, huh?

1:23:03.061 --> 1:23:03.937
- No, no, no.

1:23:06.398 --> 1:23:07.983
I'm, I'm, I'm coming home.

1:23:07.983 --> 1:23:08.817
Huh?

1:23:08.817 --> 1:23:10.360
Do you know how worry I am?

1:23:28.753 --> 1:23:29.587
Now, Anok!

1:23:31.256 --> 1:23:33.049
Just tell me you're coming.

1:23:33.049 --> 1:23:35.093
Just tell me you're coming.

1:24:58.593 --> 1:25:01.763
One
day I hope you'll have

1:25:01.763 --> 1:25:04.933
your own kids to tell stories to, Anok.

1:25:06.518 --> 1:25:08.311
That'll be nice.

1:25:09.562 --> 1:25:13.399
Maybe one day they'll
want to go home, too.
