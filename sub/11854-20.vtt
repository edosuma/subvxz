WEBVTT

00:06.333 --> 00:07.291
Aha!

00:07.375 --> 00:09.583
Well, boys..

00:09.667 --> 00:12.166
...here's to buying cheap..

00:12.250 --> 00:14.542
...and selling dear.

00:14.625 --> 00:16.500
Selling?

00:16.583 --> 00:19.917
I sold our positions in
Nevrex
right before the plummet.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.375
- Why didn't you tell us?
- Couldn't risk the leak.

00:22.458 --> 00:23.750
Timing is everything.

00:23.834 --> 00:25.542
Had to get out
before the
lemmings.

00:25.625 --> 00:27.125
'There he is...the Kipster!'

00:28.667 --> 00:29.959
- We have a problem.
- Not now, kiddo.

00:30.041 --> 00:31.750
- We're celebrating.
- 'It's important.'

00:31.834 --> 00:33.375
Everything's
important to you, Kip.

00:33.458 --> 00:35.375
And nothing is important to you.

00:35.458 --> 00:37.834
Whoa. The mouse roars.

00:37.917 --> 00:39.834
People are losing
their shirts on Nevrex.

00:39.917 --> 00:41.417
Well, I got my shirt.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.792
Ascot Chang, it's tailor-made.

00:43.875 --> 00:46.250
Please, Charlie,
we have to talk.

00:46.333 --> 00:50.125
Alright, alright,
sit down. Take a load
off.

00:52.250 --> 00:55.500
- Keep 'em coming, Vicki.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Danville.

00:59.125 --> 01:01.000
Nice tail on that one.

01:06.583 --> 01:09.792
To lives of quiet desperation..

01:10.875 --> 01:12.000
...and not leading them.

01:50.041 --> 01:52.000
Thanks for coming.

01:52.083 --> 01:53.917
You could've just
canceled over the phone.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
Canceled? And miss the chance
to see Tripod and Cyclops?

01:57.083 --> 01:59.417
Who says you're gonna see them?

01:59.500 --> 02:01.875
I'm an optimist.

02:01.959 --> 02:04.083
So, um, this guy is a friend

02:04.166 --> 02:06.041
of my older brother's.
Randy Price.

02:06.125 --> 02:08.542
Got in a jam with the SEC, FBI.

02:08.625 --> 02:10.709
Enron-type scandal.
Now he wants to cut a deal.

02:10.792 --> 02:12.208
He's got
something
on a homicide?

02:12.291 --> 02:14.709
- Charles Danville, 1985.
- Never heard of him.

02:14.792 --> 02:16.583
Big financial wizard
back in the day.

02:16.667 --> 02:17.583
Uh-huh.

02:17.667 --> 02:18.792
Now Randy is in danger

02:18.875 --> 02:20.458
of going the way
of Martha Stewart.

02:20.542 --> 02:21.875
(male #1)
'Five hundred square
feet on the water?'

02:21.959 --> 02:23.709
What are you talking about?

02:25.625 --> 02:27.041
Get your feet off my desk

02:27.125 --> 02:29.500
and your ass out
of my chair, Randy.

02:30.750 --> 02:33.083
Geez, Kite.

02:33.166 --> 02:34.750
That any way
to treat an old pal?

02:34.834 --> 02:38.083
Detective Rush, Randy Price.

02:38.166 --> 02:40.250
You're a homicide detective?

02:41.792 --> 02:43.333
I gotta start committing
some real crimes

02:43.417 --> 02:45.083
enough with this
white collar crap.

02:45.166 --> 02:47.959
You got something you
wanna tell me, Randy?

02:50.875 --> 02:52.917
I've got something amazing.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.250
I know who killed
Charles Danville.

02:57.667 --> 03:00.083
Okay, fine, you don't
wanna solve the murder

03:00.166 --> 03:02.208
of one of the biggest
names on Market Street

03:02.291 --> 03:03.291
I can take this info elsewhere.

03:03.375 --> 03:04.583
Door's that way.

03:04.667 --> 03:07.041
You told me this lady
was topnotch, Kite.

03:07.125 --> 03:09.208
She is.

03:10.417 --> 03:12.250
Look, detective

03:12.333 --> 03:15.333
before all this unpleasantness
with the SEC occurred

03:15.417 --> 03:17.625
I was Senior Vice President
of Mergers and Acquisitions--

03:17.709 --> 03:20.041
I'm really busy...Randy.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.625
Two weeks before
Danville was killed

03:24.709 --> 03:26.542
I was in the john
of this hotel.

03:32.041 --> 03:34.083
(male #2)
Son of a bitch, you lost it
all!

03:34.166 --> 03:35.625
- Do I know you?
- Stu Livermore.

03:35.709 --> 03:38.417
I invested 50 grand in
Bentech and now look at this.

03:38.500 --> 03:39.625
It's worthless.

03:39.709 --> 03:41.583
You run the dry cleaners.

03:41.667 --> 03:43.000
You begged me to let you invest.

03:43.083 --> 03:44.625
Because you were
supposed to be the big shot

03:44.709 --> 03:46.542
with all the inside information.

03:46.625 --> 03:48.166
Well, did you
read the prospectus

03:48.250 --> 03:51.125
because it clearly
states the risks involved.

03:51.208 --> 03:54.291
- I need that money back.
- Alright, alright.

03:54.959 --> 03:56.667
Stu, is it?

03:56.750 --> 03:59.375
Maybe, just maybe
if I pull a few strings

03:59.458 --> 04:01.583
I can get you into Nevrex.

04:01.667 --> 04:04.000
- What's Nevrex?
- It's a sure thing.

04:04.083 --> 04:05.625
You already wiped
me out, remember?

04:05.709 --> 04:07.458
I don't have any more money.

04:07.542 --> 04:09.000
You must think
I'm really stupid.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.750
Not stupid, desperate

04:10.834 --> 04:15.083
and Nevrex is your
way out. Trust me.

04:15.166 --> 04:18.125
- 'Don't let me pressure you.'
- You sure about this Nevrex?

04:18.208 --> 04:22.000
Hey, if you got a better
way out...take it.

04:26.542 --> 04:30.166
I got a life insurance
policy.
It's worth about ten grand.

04:30.250 --> 04:33.000
But I warn you,
this Nevrex bombs..

04:33.083 --> 04:35.083
...you're gonna
pay with your life.

04:35.166 --> 04:36.458
<i>me.</i>

04:39.041 --> 04:40.667
What happened to Nevrex?

04:40.750 --> 04:42.166
It crashed and burned

04:42.250 --> 04:44.542
two weeks after
Livermore invested.

04:44.625 --> 04:46.792
Same time Danville got killed.

04:48.709 --> 04:50.208
I told you it was good.

04:50.291 --> 04:51.500
But why didn't you
let the cops know

04:51.583 --> 04:53.291
about it back then?

04:53.375 --> 04:54.875
How would I profit from that?

04:54.959 --> 04:57.083
I was saving it for a rainy day.

04:57.166 --> 04:59.250
And now it's pouring.

05:31.959 --> 05:34.750
Theory in '85 was
a carjacking gone wrong.

05:34.834 --> 05:38.333
Danville's body was found in
an alley off of Market Street.

05:38.417 --> 05:39.542
I remember Danville.

05:39.625 --> 05:41.083
He was all over
the business section

05:41.166 --> 05:42.083
back in the '80s.

05:42.166 --> 05:43.417
Well, his DeLorean was found

05:43.500 --> 05:45.250
the next day in Ardmore

05:45.333 --> 05:46.875
twenty miles away

05:46.959 --> 05:48.417
junked and stripped.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.583
A lot of high-end cars
got jacked in '85.

05:50.667 --> 05:51.875
Yeah, they busted
a ring of guys

05:51.959 --> 05:54.792
for exporting car parts
overseas that year.

05:54.875 --> 05:56.166
Details of
the theft match
up

05:56.250 --> 05:57.458
with the MO in
all the others

05:57.542 --> 05:59.083
except this one
left a victim.

05:59.166 --> 06:01.250
And that pal
of Kite's, Randy Price?

06:01.333 --> 06:04.917
A '80s throwback. Real Market
Street "greed is good" type.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.375
But he's got information.

06:06.458 --> 06:07.709
His story about
Livermore waving

06:07.792 --> 06:09.291
that gun around
is pretty
interesting.

06:09.375 --> 06:10.750
Maybe Livermore shot Danville

06:10.834 --> 06:12.750
took the DeLorean to make
it look like a carjacking.

06:12.834 --> 06:14.250
Scotty and I'll
track down
Livermore

06:14.333 --> 06:15.750
see what he has to say.

06:15.834 --> 06:17.583
You want me and Vera to
go talk to the
last-to-see?

06:17.667 --> 06:20.125
- Yeah. Who was it?
- Victoria Jordan.

06:20.208 --> 06:22.125
Bartender at a place
called The Arbitrage.

06:22.208 --> 06:23.375
Oh, I've been there.

06:23.458 --> 06:24.959
With my stockbroker.

06:25.041 --> 06:26.458
You're in the market, boss?

06:26.542 --> 06:28.291
Half of America is, Lil.

06:28.375 --> 06:29.542
Not my half.

06:31.291 --> 06:32.500
I'll give my
broker a call.

06:32.583 --> 06:34.041
See what he knows
about Danville

06:34.125 --> 06:35.875
and the company
he used to work for.

06:44.583 --> 06:46.667
(Lilly)
'Stu Livermore?'

06:46.750 --> 06:50.250
- Detectives Rush and Valens.
- Hey, finders keepers.

06:50.333 --> 06:52.000
It ain't illegal
collecting discarded
tickets.

06:52.083 --> 06:54.458
We want to talk to you
about Charles Danville.

06:54.542 --> 06:57.625
Danville, that lying
huckster ruined my
life.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.750
We heard.

06:59.834 --> 07:03.500
- You been talking to my ex?
- She told us where to find
you.

07:03.583 --> 07:06.208
You had a run-in
with him, June 7, 1985?

07:07.375 --> 07:09.291
Swore that if Nevrex
bombed, you'd kill him.

07:09.375 --> 07:11.166
That's right.

07:11.250 --> 07:13.417
What? You think I made
good on that threat?

07:13.500 --> 07:14.834
You shoved a gun to his chest.

07:14.917 --> 07:16.333
Should have fired it too.

07:16.417 --> 07:19.375
But instead, I invested
another ten grand with
him.

07:19.458 --> 07:21.667
Two weeks later
that was gone
too.

07:27.125 --> 07:29.291
Mr. Livermore,
hey, Kip Crowley.

07:29.375 --> 07:31.125
I'm an associate
of Mr. Danville's.

07:31.208 --> 07:33.917
I don't want an
associate.
I want Danville!

07:34.792 --> 07:36.542
Mr. Danville is extremely busy.

07:36.625 --> 07:39.583
Yeah, busy robbing
honest people like me.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.041
You know I went
to the headquarters

07:41.125 --> 07:43.041
of Nevrex Corporation.
You know what I found?

07:43.125 --> 07:44.542
One..

07:44.625 --> 07:46.500
...one old lady in
an eight by ten office

07:46.583 --> 07:48.583
answering the phone,
That's Nevrex.

07:48.667 --> 07:51.500
An old lady with a phone.

07:51.583 --> 07:54.041
- You must be mistaken.
- No mistake.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.458
Well, I'm sure that
there is an explanation.

07:56.542 --> 07:59.625
That money was gonna pay
for my children's educations.

07:59.709 --> 08:02.083
My wife's gonna leave me.

08:06.125 --> 08:08.709
I'd kill myself, but it
wouldn't do any good.

08:08.792 --> 08:11.834
I already cashed in
my life insurance.

08:11.917 --> 08:14.375
No, hey, I..

08:14.458 --> 08:17.250
...I'm very sorry.

08:17.333 --> 08:19.250
Please, I'm begging you.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.041
If I don't get that money back..

08:21.125 --> 08:23.250
Just, you give me your number,
Mr. Livermore, okay?

08:23.333 --> 08:25.166
I personally guarantee
that Mr. Danville

08:25.250 --> 08:27.417
will look into this
and-and-and call you.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.125
- When?
- End of day.

08:29.208 --> 08:31.500
Tomorrow morning at the latest.

08:31.583 --> 08:33.125
I give you my word.

08:38.709 --> 08:41.583
I was sitting by the phone
all that day like a chump

08:41.667 --> 08:44.625
waiting for that
kid to come
through.

08:44.709 --> 08:47.166
I-I got the brush-off.
I finally went to bed.

08:47.250 --> 08:49.542
Then I saw the story
on the morning news.

08:49.625 --> 08:50.959
And you never got
your money back?

08:51.041 --> 08:53.750
Yeah, I guess I could
have hired a lawyer..

08:53.834 --> 08:56.709
...tried to sue, you know,
if I had a cent to my name

08:56.792 --> 08:58.291
'but I didn't.'

08:59.291 --> 09:00.834
Still don't.

09:05.458 --> 09:08.417
You were the last person
to see Charles Danville
alive?

09:08.500 --> 09:10.125
Yeah, around 2 a.m.

09:10.208 --> 09:12.458
Saw him walk out that
door like every night.

09:12.542 --> 09:14.959
- Anyone with him?
- Nope.

09:15.041 --> 09:16.500
Lost Boys left earlier.

09:16.583 --> 09:18.917
- "Lost Boys?"
- Yeah.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.417
Danville had a group of young
boys that worshipped him.

09:21.500 --> 09:22.458
'Fed his ego.'

09:22.542 --> 09:23.458
From Collins Brothers

09:23.542 --> 09:24.625
the firm where he worked?

09:24.709 --> 09:25.792
They wished.

09:25.875 --> 09:27.917
Danville's boys
weren't Ivy League.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.625
They were wannabes, on
the outside looking in

09:30.709 --> 09:32.625
until Danville
took pity on them

09:32.709 --> 09:34.125
about a month before he died.

09:34.208 --> 09:36.667
- He hadn't met them before?
- Nope.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.625
Not that I knew of at least.

09:38.709 --> 09:41.959
But, uh, he got real
friendly, real fast.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.667
One day that'll be us, boys.

09:48.750 --> 09:51.041
Yeah, in a galaxy far, far away.

09:51.125 --> 09:53.291
Shh, maybe we'll
get some stock tips.

09:55.291 --> 09:57.917
Holy crap, that
is Charles Danville.

09:59.583 --> 10:01.250
He's-he's coming our way.

10:01.333 --> 10:03.000
Be cool.

10:05.417 --> 10:08.709
Mr. Danville...can
we buy you a drink?

10:10.041 --> 10:11.792
You guys from Blaine?

10:11.875 --> 10:13.667
- Yeah.
- How could, how could you
tell?

10:13.750 --> 10:16.291
Well, to start, you dress
like used car salesmen.

10:16.375 --> 10:20.250
You're at the bar because you
can only afford an appetizer.

10:20.333 --> 10:22.458
And you're gawking at the swells

10:22.542 --> 10:25.667
like they're
a different species..

10:25.750 --> 10:26.875
...which they are.

10:28.166 --> 10:30.208
Except for me.

10:30.291 --> 10:31.291
I used to work in a sweatshop

10:31.375 --> 10:33.500
just like Blaine
back in the day.

10:33.583 --> 10:35.709
Cold calling chumps for
ten dollar commissions.

10:35.792 --> 10:37.917
So how did you get
to where you are?

10:38.000 --> 10:40.083
Cajones,

10:42.792 --> 10:43.875
You guys got 'em?

10:43.959 --> 10:45.792
<i>cajones.</i>
- Yeah.

10:45.875 --> 10:48.291
Good, 'cause if you're hungry

10:48.375 --> 10:49.917
maybe I can help you out.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.625
Seriously?

10:51.709 --> 10:53.208
I'm putting together
a bond offering

10:53.291 --> 10:55.875
for a company called Nevrex.

10:55.959 --> 10:58.000
You know Nevrex?

10:58.083 --> 11:01.041
- Yeah, of course.
- Nevrex is awesome.

11:01.125 --> 11:04.875
You're crappy liars...
but you'll get better.

11:04.959 --> 11:08.000
Stick with me, I'll teach you
how to sell snow to Eskimos.

11:08.083 --> 11:10.834
Be millionaires by
the end of summer.

11:10.917 --> 11:12.125
Interested?

11:12.208 --> 11:14.291
(all)
Yeah.

11:17.125 --> 11:18.792
Why would a big
shot like
Danville

11:18.875 --> 11:20.333
wanna associate with nobodies?

11:20.417 --> 11:23.458
Maybe he saw
himself in those boys.

11:23.542 --> 11:25.917
Maybe he was just slumming.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.291
All I know is, the day he died

11:28.375 --> 11:31.250
we got stuck
with an $11,000 tab.

11:31.333 --> 11:32.250
Eleven grand.

11:32.333 --> 11:34.083
That's worth more than my car.

11:34.166 --> 11:35.125
Way more.

11:35.208 --> 11:36.709
Owner of
the Arbitrage at the time

11:36.792 --> 11:38.583
he thought Danville
was made of money.

11:38.667 --> 11:40.750
Just too busy to get
around to paying it.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.125
Me, oh, I never would
have let that happen.

11:43.208 --> 11:46.750
- The owner still around?
- Sold the place, to me.

11:46.834 --> 11:48.792
And, uh, I don't give credit.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.375
To no one. Four bucks.

11:54.917 --> 11:57.083
So Mackey's your broker, huh?

11:57.166 --> 11:59.458
Told you where to find me?

11:59.542 --> 12:02.291
So, Danville worked for
you for what, six years?

12:02.375 --> 12:03.959
Oh, something like that.

12:04.041 --> 12:05.917
Thought he got killed
in a carjacking?

12:06.000 --> 12:08.208
Well, we're taking
another look at
that.

12:08.291 --> 12:10.792
My detectives talked to
a woman at the Arbitrage

12:10.875 --> 12:13.959
who said the guy was a
louse,
welched on his debts.

12:14.041 --> 12:15.208
Sounds about right.

12:15.291 --> 12:17.000
I thought Danville
was a heavy hitter.

12:17.083 --> 12:19.959
- Rolling in dough.
- Oh, he was, for a while.

12:20.041 --> 12:21.208
Then he hit a losing streak.

12:21.291 --> 12:23.000
Every stock he hyped
went in the toilet.

12:23.083 --> 12:25.375
- That's why we fired him.
- "Fired?"

12:25.458 --> 12:27.458
Wasn't he still an
employee
of Collins Brothers

12:27.542 --> 12:28.500
when he died?

12:28.583 --> 12:31.125
On paper he was.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.959
But he begged us to
let him stay unsalaried

12:34.041 --> 12:36.333
until he could get
another gig going.

12:36.417 --> 12:38.333
So Danville was on the ropes?

12:38.417 --> 12:41.000
Day he died, we had
to cover about a half mil

12:41.083 --> 12:43.667
of his debts to protect
the firm's reputation.

12:43.750 --> 12:45.083
Keep up appearances?

12:45.166 --> 12:49.000
And keep the authorities off
our backs checking records.

12:49.083 --> 12:51.625
Fat lot of good it
did us,
considering..

12:51.709 --> 12:54.500
...I got popped
for insider
trading.

12:54.583 --> 12:56.041
Well, it could
have been worse.

12:56.125 --> 12:57.959
You could have ended
up like Danville.

12:58.041 --> 12:59.709
- Broke?
- Dead.

13:08.542 --> 13:10.208
So Danville's broke
but still playing a big
shot.

13:10.291 --> 13:11.917
Yeah, and scrambling to get
the Nevrex deal off the ground

13:12.000 --> 13:13.583
while his reputation's
still intact

13:13.667 --> 13:16.041
and
an office at Collins
Brothers.

13:16.125 --> 13:17.458
(Nick)
'So this guy is all tapped
out'

13:17.542 --> 13:19.375
but he's still got
a corporate apartment

13:19.458 --> 13:20.709
tab at a five-star restaurant

13:20.792 --> 13:22.375
and a DeLorean to push around?

13:22.458 --> 13:23.667
How do I get this job?

13:23.750 --> 13:24.917
Now, how come
the assigned didn't
look

13:25.000 --> 13:26.500
at disgruntled
investors for
this?

13:26.583 --> 13:28.000
Carjacking theory looked solid.

13:28.083 --> 13:30.125
Collins Brothers
covered for Danville.

13:30.208 --> 13:31.875
They erased the paper
trail of his debts.

13:31.959 --> 13:33.000
Plus, white-collar criminals

13:33.083 --> 13:35.583
usually get sued, not shot.

13:35.667 --> 13:38.000
So maybe the doer isn't
your typical investor.

13:38.083 --> 13:39.542
(John)
'Let's get the SEC records.'

13:39.625 --> 13:41.375
See if anyone with
a criminal record

13:41.458 --> 13:42.709
bought shares of Nevrex.

13:42.792 --> 13:44.792
We'll go talk to
Danville's old
associates.

13:44.875 --> 13:45.834
The Lost Boys.

13:45.917 --> 13:46.917
Start with the kid
who was supposed

13:47.000 --> 13:48.083
to get back to Livermore.

13:48.166 --> 13:49.875
Kip.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.000
Kip Crowley?

13:56.000 --> 13:57.458
Detectives Rush
and Valens.

13:57.542 --> 13:59.125
It's about Charles Danville.

13:59.208 --> 14:01.834
Charlie Danville?
That was a lifetime ago.

14:01.917 --> 14:04.959
We've been talking to an old
associate of yours, Randy
Price.

14:05.041 --> 14:06.792
Oh, yeah, I read about Randy.

14:06.875 --> 14:08.500
He's in trouble
with the SEC, huh?

14:08.583 --> 14:11.041
He says Stu Livermore
threatened Danville's life.

14:11.125 --> 14:12.208
No kidding.

14:12.291 --> 14:13.875
We know you dealt
with Livermore in '85

14:13.959 --> 14:15.750
running interference
for Danville.

14:15.834 --> 14:17.583
But you never told
the cops about that.

14:17.667 --> 14:19.667
Well, Charlie was
killed in a carjacking.

14:19.750 --> 14:21.583
What would Livermore
have to do with that?

14:21.667 --> 14:23.417
Did you know he
pulled a gun on Danville

14:23.500 --> 14:24.709
two weeks before his death?

14:24.792 --> 14:27.041
Oh. No, I didn't.

14:27.125 --> 14:28.750
'I just felt bad for the guy.'

14:29.959 --> 14:31.583
Did you talk to him?
Is he making out?

14:31.667 --> 14:34.917
He's collecting used tickets
off the floor at the OTB.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.333
Well, that's a shame.

14:39.792 --> 14:41.333
I tried to talk
to Charlie about him

14:41.417 --> 14:43.417
the night that he died.

14:43.500 --> 14:46.709
To lives of quiet desperation..

14:48.000 --> 14:49.375
...and not leading them.

14:49.458 --> 14:50.542
(male #3)
'Yeah.'

14:57.417 --> 15:00.125
So, kiddo

15:00.208 --> 15:02.458
what's so important
that it can't wait?

15:02.542 --> 15:04.959
I went to the
headquarters
of Nevrex Corporation.

15:05.041 --> 15:06.458
This about the dry cleaner mope?

15:06.542 --> 15:08.333
Livermore. And he was right.

15:08.417 --> 15:09.542
It's nothing. Nothing.

15:09.625 --> 15:11.166
It's an old lady
answering phones.

15:11.250 --> 15:14.458
So? It's the idea that counts.

15:14.542 --> 15:15.625
Not the brick and mortar.

15:15.709 --> 15:18.375
Charlie, I-I promised Livermore

15:18.458 --> 15:20.500
that you would call him.
I personally guaranteed--

15:20.583 --> 15:22.333
Don't promise things, kiddo.

15:22.417 --> 15:24.542
Can you help him?

15:24.625 --> 15:26.083
Please.

15:26.166 --> 15:27.667
For me.

15:29.875 --> 15:33.792
That's good, Kip, going
for the heart like that.

15:33.875 --> 15:36.000
I actually have
taught you something.

15:36.083 --> 15:39.291
- So you will talk to him?
- No.

15:39.375 --> 15:42.417
Hey, I'm a heartless
bastard, remember?

15:42.500 --> 15:44.166
No, you're not.

15:47.083 --> 15:49.667
You are too good to be true.

15:49.750 --> 15:51.250
Kiddo, have a drink.

15:52.083 --> 15:53.583
Lighten up.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.709
That was the last
time that I saw
him.

16:01.792 --> 16:04.083
I walked to the train
and went to my mom's.

16:05.583 --> 16:07.208
Danville sounds like
he was telling the truth

16:07.291 --> 16:09.000
about being
a heartless bastard, huh?

16:09.083 --> 16:11.375
No, that was just his way.

16:11.458 --> 16:13.500
He was trying to
train me to be like
him.

16:13.583 --> 16:15.583
Were you upset when he died?

16:15.667 --> 16:17.375
Broken up.

16:17.458 --> 16:22.083
Like I said, he, he was
trying to teach me to
succeed.

16:22.166 --> 16:25.208
It wasn't his fault I
couldn't cut it in that
world.

16:28.917 --> 16:31.041
These are records from the SEC.

16:31.125 --> 16:34.208
About 4,000 people invested
in Nevrex back in '85.

16:34.291 --> 16:35.875
Most for a thousand bucks or so.

16:35.959 --> 16:38.458
And only a dozen went
in for over 25 grand.

16:38.542 --> 16:39.875
Anyone with a record?

16:39.959 --> 16:41.667
Yeah, one.
Teddy Mars.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.625
Served five years
for dealing cocaine

16:43.709 --> 16:44.709
in the late '80s.

16:44.792 --> 16:46.166
And another three
for manslaughter.

16:46.250 --> 16:48.542
Broke a guy's
neck in Frackville.

16:48.625 --> 16:50.417
How's a thug like
Mars get into
business

16:50.500 --> 16:52.208
with a
high-roller
like Danville?

16:52.291 --> 16:54.291
Well, if he was selling
cocaine to Danville

16:54.375 --> 16:55.625
Danville was broke.

16:55.709 --> 16:57.583
Maybe there was some
bartering going on.

16:57.667 --> 16:59.583
Cocaine for stocks?

16:59.667 --> 17:00.959
And if those investments tanked?

17:01.041 --> 17:03.750
Mars would come collecting,
the old-fashioned way.

17:03.834 --> 17:06.291
[chuckles]
Now check with
his parole
officer.

17:06.375 --> 17:08.125
See if he's got
a good address.

17:16.083 --> 17:17.542
Teddy Mars?

17:17.625 --> 17:20.250
Wanna talk to you
about Charles Danville.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.792
You ain't vice.

17:23.875 --> 17:26.083
- And you don't look like
narcs.
- Homicide.

17:26.166 --> 17:28.959
You invested 25 grand
in a company Danville

17:29.041 --> 17:31.458
was selling called Nevrex?

17:31.542 --> 17:34.583
Hold up. Let me get
my lawyer down here.

17:34.667 --> 17:37.041
We're gonna have a real nice
pow-wow, just the four of us.

17:37.125 --> 17:40.000
While you're on the line,
we'll
talk to your boys over there.

17:40.083 --> 17:41.166
What boys?

17:41.250 --> 17:44.208
The ones that are
dealing for you.

17:44.291 --> 17:46.291
You got me wrong, detectives

17:46.375 --> 17:47.959
I'm an artist now.

17:48.041 --> 17:49.917
Well, suit yourself, Teddy.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.166
But if they're holding,
you're comin' with us.

17:53.500 --> 17:55.083
So how'd you get
involved with
Danville?

17:55.166 --> 17:56.667
That ain't a secret.

17:56.750 --> 17:59.083
For a time, I supplied
all
the joints on Market
Street.

17:59.166 --> 18:02.458
- Including the Arbitrage?
- Especially the Arbitrage.

18:02.542 --> 18:04.667
Them Brooks-Brother types
liked to party.

18:14.709 --> 18:16.166
Teddy..

18:17.750 --> 18:18.875
...you should
get on this Nevrex.

18:18.959 --> 18:20.250
Make yourself a fortune.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.834
You want to taste
the merchandise?

18:21.917 --> 18:24.333
How much for the whole ounce?

18:24.417 --> 18:25.625
The boys deserve a treat.

18:25.709 --> 18:27.166
Ounce is three grand.

18:27.250 --> 18:30.041
- You already owe me ten.
- You know what?

18:30.125 --> 18:32.959
I'm gonna cut you in on
this Nevrex deal for
25,000.

18:33.041 --> 18:34.750
Couple of months,
be worth twice that

18:34.834 --> 18:35.750
maybe three times.

18:35.834 --> 18:37.250
Yeah, yeah. You do that.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.750
After you pay me
the 13 grand in cash

18:39.834 --> 18:41.083
I'll give it a think-through.

18:41.166 --> 18:42.667
Teddy, this Nevrex is
like money in the bank.

18:42.750 --> 18:44.000
You don't got it, do ya?

18:44.083 --> 18:48.500
I'm offering you
25 grand in bonds for 13.

18:48.583 --> 18:52.083
- Give me your Rolex.
- Teddy, come on.

19:04.667 --> 19:08.417
I'm gonna take your watch
and your worthless paper.

19:08.500 --> 19:13.083
But in 24 hours,
I want my 13K...in cash.

19:14.083 --> 19:15.917
So, did you get your money?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.500
Next day,
one of Charlie's
boys

19:18.583 --> 19:20.500
delivered a
briefcase
full of green.

19:20.583 --> 19:22.792
You happen to remember
who gave you the money?

19:22.875 --> 19:25.667
Yeah, the pretty
boy,
Beau something.

19:25.750 --> 19:27.375
Look, if you don't
believe me, ask
him.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.417
He'd tell you, I got paid.

19:29.500 --> 19:32.458
I didn't kill Charlie
'cause I had no reason
to.

19:32.542 --> 19:35.083
I may have met
a Mr. Mars back in the '80s

19:35.166 --> 19:37.750
but I couldn't say for sure.

19:37.834 --> 19:40.959
We're homicide,
Beau. Not narcotics.

19:41.041 --> 19:42.417
Or the SEC.

19:45.375 --> 19:47.625
Well, then..

19:47.709 --> 19:49.083
...hell, yeah, I remember Teddy.

19:49.166 --> 19:50.083
He was our supplier.

19:50.166 --> 19:51.250
Did Danville send you to him

19:51.333 --> 19:52.709
with a briefcase full of money?

19:52.792 --> 19:55.500
Yeah, and he was
pissed about it too.

19:55.583 --> 19:57.083
We were coining it on Nevrex

19:57.166 --> 20:00.834
but Charlie hated to
part with the actual cash.

20:00.917 --> 20:02.000
So why did he?

20:02.083 --> 20:03.500
'Cause Charlie
could take the
heat

20:03.583 --> 20:05.667
from the blue-haired
old ladies we were
bilking

20:05.750 --> 20:07.917
but Teddy Mars was
a different story.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.166
So you knew Danville
was a swindler?

20:11.291 --> 20:13.750
I looked the other way.

20:13.834 --> 20:15.375
You know any other
investors
who might have liked

20:15.458 --> 20:16.917
to see Danville dead?

20:17.000 --> 20:18.917
Investors? No.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.458
Then who?

20:24.250 --> 20:26.125
After I gave Teddy the cash

20:26.208 --> 20:28.875
I went back to Charlie's
to return his Rolex.

20:36.959 --> 20:39.834
My brave boy back
from the trenches.

20:39.917 --> 20:41.333
That guy scared
the piss out of me.

20:45.500 --> 20:47.917
Sit down,
take a load
off.

20:53.208 --> 20:55.417
Help yourself.

20:55.500 --> 20:56.750
Thanks.

21:02.083 --> 21:04.250
Oh, I, uh, I got
your watch back.

21:08.417 --> 21:10.291
I want you to keep it.

21:10.375 --> 21:12.792
Token of my appreciation.

21:12.875 --> 21:14.125
Seriously?

21:17.792 --> 21:19.375
You're the one, Beau.

21:19.458 --> 21:21.417
You're the one
that's
gonna make it big.

21:21.500 --> 21:22.375
I am?

21:22.458 --> 21:23.375
I don't think the others

21:23.458 --> 21:26.083
have what it takes, but you..

21:28.917 --> 21:30.834
...you know what it takes..

21:32.291 --> 21:34.000
...don't you?

21:36.625 --> 21:38.875
That's when I got out.

21:38.959 --> 21:40.792
Danville hit on
anyone else you know of?

21:40.875 --> 21:42.500
He hit on all of us.

21:42.583 --> 21:44.041
If you wanted to
succeed with
Charlie

21:44.125 --> 21:45.500
you played by his rules.

21:45.583 --> 21:47.041
And that meant
sleeping with him?

21:47.125 --> 21:50.375
If you wanted to get
ahead,
that's what it meant.

21:58.959 --> 22:01.041
Want a deal, Randy,
you start talking.

22:01.125 --> 22:04.083
And you tell all.
No more saving for a rainy
day.

22:04.166 --> 22:06.125
Livermore didn't kill Danville.

22:06.208 --> 22:07.375
I know what I heard.

22:07.458 --> 22:10.458
You know what we heard?
Danville liked boys.

22:10.542 --> 22:12.959
Young ones,
up-and-comers, like you.

22:13.041 --> 22:15.166
He hit on you, Randy?
'Cause he hit on Beau.

22:15.250 --> 22:18.583
Yeah, but Beau didn't
kill him. He's got an
<i>alibi.</i>

22:18.667 --> 22:20.542
He was at his girlfriend's
the night Danville got dead.

22:20.625 --> 22:23.500
But you, you don't
alibi,

22:23.583 --> 22:26.291
Wait a minute, you
think I killed Danville?

22:26.375 --> 22:28.333
[laughs]
That's insane.

22:28.417 --> 22:30.750
So you like biting the pillow?

22:31.917 --> 22:33.000
You didn't get horizontal

22:33.083 --> 22:35.333
to make it to homicide?

22:35.417 --> 22:39.125
Guy's worthless.
This deal's off.

22:39.208 --> 22:41.375
Okay, okay, cool your jets.

22:43.375 --> 22:44.542
God.

22:45.709 --> 22:48.166
Did I service
Danville to get ahead?

22:48.250 --> 22:49.917
Yeah. So what?

22:50.000 --> 22:52.667
So maybe you felt
humiliated by that?

22:52.750 --> 22:55.375
Decided to gun down the man
who made you catch for him.

22:55.458 --> 22:58.125
I did what I had
to do. Big deal.

22:58.208 --> 22:59.375
You got anything
more on Danville

22:59.458 --> 23:00.625
you want to say it
right now, Randy

23:00.709 --> 23:04.208
'cause your deal
is going South...fast.

23:06.375 --> 23:08.750
Okay.

23:08.834 --> 23:10.917
Alright.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.792
This is the entire truth.

23:12.875 --> 23:14.208
That's big for Randy.

23:15.709 --> 23:17.625
I met Danville
earlier
than I said before.

23:17.709 --> 23:18.959
How much earlier?

23:19.041 --> 23:21.417
Little more than a
month
before he was killed.

23:35.917 --> 23:37.333
You want a ride?

23:37.417 --> 23:39.000
Hey, you're Charles Danville.

23:39.083 --> 23:40.667
That's right.

23:40.750 --> 23:42.709
And you work
for Blaine and Sons.

23:42.792 --> 23:44.291
How do you know that?

23:44.375 --> 23:46.917
I used to have a crappy
umbrella just like that.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.542
[laughs]
Hop in.

23:54.834 --> 23:56.083
Wow.

23:57.291 --> 23:59.375
This is so cool.

23:59.458 --> 24:01.083
Took me a hard day's
work to afford it.

24:03.375 --> 24:04.750
You think I'm kidding?

24:04.834 --> 24:06.542
No.

24:06.625 --> 24:09.083
You know, I used to work
for a joint like Blaine

24:09.166 --> 24:10.166
back in the day.

24:10.250 --> 24:11.709
- Seriously?
- Till I wised up.

24:11.792 --> 24:14.208
Took some risks.

24:14.291 --> 24:16.125
You a risk-taker, uh..

24:16.208 --> 24:18.500
Randy. Randy Price.

24:18.583 --> 24:21.583
- Yeah, I like risk.
- Good, Randy.

24:21.667 --> 24:23.792
'Cause I'm gonna
make you a
proposition.

24:23.875 --> 24:26.041
I'm gonna create
a company out of thin
air

24:26.125 --> 24:27.458
sell the hell out of it.

24:27.542 --> 24:30.583
- Can you do that?
- I'm Charles Danville.

24:30.667 --> 24:32.333
I can do anything.

24:33.583 --> 24:36.583
Still looking for
a couple of
salesmen.

24:36.667 --> 24:38.917
You know anyone who
might be interested?

24:45.208 --> 24:47.375
So Danville meeting
you and Kip and Beau

24:47.458 --> 24:49.083
at the Arbitrage,
that was a setup?

24:49.166 --> 24:51.333
Yep. Worked like a charm too.

24:51.417 --> 24:53.792
And Beau and Kip never
knew Nevrex was bogus?

24:53.875 --> 24:55.500
Beau knew it was
a boiler room scam

24:55.583 --> 24:58.000
but he didn't care so
long so he was making out.

24:58.083 --> 25:00.208
And Kip?

25:00.291 --> 25:02.458
Kip was a fool.
Out of his depth.

25:03.667 --> 25:05.333
Believed every word
that Danville said.

25:05.417 --> 25:07.333
And why'd you keep
this from us, Randy?

25:07.417 --> 25:09.709
Because it was a crooked deal.

25:11.417 --> 25:14.000
And I'm facing charges
of investor fraud.

25:14.083 --> 25:16.458
Okay, look, you know what?
I-I just remembered something.

25:16.542 --> 25:18.750
- And this is good.
- Oh, you feel that?

25:18.834 --> 25:20.083
It's raining again.

25:20.166 --> 25:22.166
Kip Crowley, the dummy,
he got his mother

25:22.250 --> 25:24.333
to invest in Nevrex.

25:24.417 --> 25:25.625
And she lost a bundle.

25:25.709 --> 25:26.750
Oh, we've seen
the list of investors

25:26.834 --> 25:27.959
there's no Crowley.

25:28.041 --> 25:30.166
No, Danville told
me she invested.

25:30.250 --> 25:32.417
He bragged about
closing the deal.

25:34.667 --> 25:37.959
Hey, your boyfriend in
there was telling the truth.

25:38.041 --> 25:39.583
That's too bad.

25:39.667 --> 25:41.667
Kip's mom did invest in Nevrex.

25:41.750 --> 25:43.667
She went by
Mavis Breen, not Crowley.

25:43.750 --> 25:46.792
- How much she drop?
- 50 grand.

25:46.875 --> 25:49.000
That's worth a conversation.

25:50.208 --> 25:52.542
What? You got plans?

25:52.625 --> 25:54.667
Kind of.

25:54.750 --> 25:58.083
- You got plans?
- You kidding? I'm married.

25:58.166 --> 26:00.375
I'll take any excuse
not to go home.

26:01.625 --> 26:04.500
I wish you boys would've
given me some warning.

26:04.583 --> 26:07.792
Would've made
myself
presentable.

26:07.875 --> 26:11.250
We just wanted to ask you
about Nevrex, Mrs. Breen.

26:11.333 --> 26:13.917
Mavis, please.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.458
I'm divorced.

26:15.542 --> 26:17.166
Can you tell us
how you came to
invest

26:17.250 --> 26:19.291
in the company...Mavis?

26:19.375 --> 26:22.041
You'd have to ask
Kip about Nevrex.

26:22.125 --> 26:23.750
Well, we'd rather talk to you.

26:23.834 --> 26:27.834
Wait. Kip isn't in
any trouble, is he?

26:27.917 --> 26:30.500
'Cause if he is, it's my fault.

26:30.583 --> 26:32.291
And how would that work?

26:32.375 --> 26:34.500
[sighs]
Well, when it comes to men..

26:34.583 --> 26:37.125
...I make terrible choices.

26:37.208 --> 26:39.166
'And poor Kip had
to suffer through'

26:39.250 --> 26:42.000
my divorces. Yeah,
all four of them.

26:42.083 --> 26:44.750
So about Nevrex..

26:44.834 --> 26:46.166
...Kip told you to invest?

26:46.250 --> 26:48.417
Yeah, well, he knew I
had some money in the bank

26:48.500 --> 26:49.625
from my last settlement.

26:49.709 --> 26:52.166
He just wanted
to help me grow it.

26:52.250 --> 26:54.250
Did you ever meet
Charles Danville?

26:54.333 --> 26:56.417
He took Kip and me to dinner.

26:56.500 --> 26:59.083
You know...to make his pitch.

26:59.625 --> 27:01.208
<i>Cincin.</i>

27:12.041 --> 27:13.125
What is this?

27:13.208 --> 27:15.500
Well, now that is
called sushi, Ms. Breen.

27:15.583 --> 27:18.208
Oh, it's Mavis.

27:18.291 --> 27:19.458
Well, why isn't it cooked?

27:20.750 --> 27:23.000
Oh, it's cutting edge.

27:23.083 --> 27:25.166
Raw's the next big thing.

27:25.250 --> 27:27.709
Well, I prefer chicken teriyaki.

27:31.125 --> 27:34.792
Mom, Charlie has a great
investment opportunity for
you.

27:34.875 --> 27:37.041
It's a company
called Nevrex, Mavis.

27:37.125 --> 27:39.917
High-tech. Japanese are
interested in investing.

27:40.000 --> 27:40.959
Right, Charlie?

27:41.041 --> 27:42.000
But I promise it has

27:42.083 --> 27:43.250
nothing to do with sushi.

27:45.542 --> 27:47.750
Charlie's a genius, mom.

27:47.834 --> 27:49.750
He's a senior VP
at Collins Brothers.

27:49.834 --> 27:51.291
I've heard of Collins Brothers.

27:51.375 --> 27:54.959
Well, I'm old news.
Kip here is the future.

27:55.041 --> 27:56.375
No thanks to you, huh?

27:56.458 --> 27:58.834
I may have helped
out a little bit.

27:58.917 --> 28:01.250
Charlie is my mentor, mom.

28:01.333 --> 28:03.583
You flatter me, kiddo.

28:03.667 --> 28:06.834
Well, I certainly appreciate
you
taking an interest in my boy..

28:08.166 --> 28:10.917
...but when it
comes to investing

28:11.000 --> 28:12.417
I'm awful cautious.

28:12.500 --> 28:14.250
Well, your mom's
a smart lady, Kip.

28:16.375 --> 28:18.333
It's obviously going to
take more than one dinner

28:18.417 --> 28:20.709
to get her to see
the wisdom of investing.

28:22.750 --> 28:25.625
So...Danville convinced you?

28:25.709 --> 28:26.792
Eventually.

28:26.875 --> 28:29.375
I really invested
for Kip's sake.

28:29.458 --> 28:32.625
You know, to help
advance his career.

28:32.709 --> 28:33.959
that

28:34.041 --> 28:35.125
You must've been pretty angry

28:35.208 --> 28:36.291
losing all that money.

28:36.375 --> 28:37.959
- Furious.
- How about Kip?

28:38.041 --> 28:39.250
He was devastated.

28:39.333 --> 28:41.375
He really believed
in that Danville.

28:41.458 --> 28:44.291
So maybe in your defense,
he took revenge on Danville.

28:44.375 --> 28:47.959
Oh, no. My Kip
couldn't hurt a fly.

28:49.041 --> 28:50.500
Me, on the other hand

28:50.583 --> 28:54.583
I wanted to string Danville
up by his lying neck.

28:54.667 --> 28:56.333
But, of course, I didn't.

28:57.542 --> 29:00.000
Man was dead before
I could buy a rope.

29:03.917 --> 29:06.083
Oh, your friend
Price
is a real prince.

29:06.166 --> 29:09.083
He's my brother's friend
and he's always been a
lowlife.

29:09.166 --> 29:13.083
Well, he's a saint
compared to
Danville.

29:13.166 --> 29:15.542
But that's the J-O-B.

29:15.625 --> 29:17.834
We don't get to
pick our
victims.

29:19.750 --> 29:22.166
So, you, uh..

29:22.250 --> 29:24.542
...wanna go see another
movie tomorrow night?

29:24.625 --> 29:27.792
It's first
Thursday's
tomorrow.

29:27.875 --> 29:28.959
First what?

29:29.041 --> 29:30.417
First Thursday of every month

29:30.500 --> 29:32.333
the homicide
detectives get
together

29:32.417 --> 29:34.000
retired and active.

29:34.083 --> 29:36.166
- To do what?
- Talk.

29:36.250 --> 29:37.333
Drink.

29:37.417 --> 29:39.125
Sounds fun.
Bring me along.

29:39.208 --> 29:41.000
Uh, I don't know, Kite.

29:41.083 --> 29:42.834
You're not in the "Hat Squad."

29:42.917 --> 29:45.291
You guys have more weird
names for yourselves.

29:45.375 --> 29:47.959
It's usually just cops.

29:49.500 --> 29:51.875
Well, I'm a friend of a cop.

29:59.875 --> 30:01.834
You wanna see the girls?

30:14.291 --> 30:16.375
- Met your mom, Kip.
- You did?

30:16.458 --> 30:20.333
Yeah, I heard how she
lost a cool 50K to
Nevrex.

30:20.417 --> 30:21.542
Oh, boy.

30:21.625 --> 30:23.208
Forgot to mention
that to us, did you?

30:23.291 --> 30:25.083
Well, I-I-I didn't tell
you, because I thought

30:25.166 --> 30:26.542
it would look like
I killed Charlie.

30:26.625 --> 30:28.917
- It does.
- That's just the half of
it.

30:29.000 --> 30:29.959
What do you mean?

30:30.041 --> 30:31.583
Randy Price, Beau Munger

30:31.667 --> 30:34.166
they say Danville
was a sexual
predator.

30:34.250 --> 30:36.250
They said that?

30:36.333 --> 30:38.583
Come on, Kip, quit the act.

30:38.667 --> 30:40.083
You worshipped Danville.

30:40.166 --> 30:42.583
Not only did he use you
to get to your mom's money..

30:42.667 --> 30:44.458
He hit on you too.

30:45.083 --> 30:46.291
No.

30:47.583 --> 30:49.125
That's not how it went.

30:53.166 --> 30:55.750
You really think
I should buy it?

30:55.834 --> 30:57.166
Hell, yes, I think
you should buy it.

30:57.250 --> 30:58.375
Uh, maybe I should

30:58.458 --> 30:59.750
save the money that
we're making off Nevrex.

30:59.834 --> 31:01.291
No, no, kiddo..

31:01.375 --> 31:03.291
[chuckles]
...there's plenty
more

31:03.375 --> 31:04.291
where that came from.

31:04.375 --> 31:06.500
- I do love it.
- Then buy it.

31:06.583 --> 31:08.458
- You deserve it.
- Yeah?

31:08.542 --> 31:10.125
I'm really proud
of you, you know.

31:10.208 --> 31:12.834
- You've come a long way.
- I don't know.

31:14.125 --> 31:15.917
Hey, kiddo, you
stick with me.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.542
You're gonna rule
Market Street one
day.

31:18.625 --> 31:20.792
Follow right in my footsteps.

31:20.875 --> 31:24.041
Come on, kiddo, let's grab
the bull by the horns.

31:24.125 --> 31:25.375
Okay.

31:26.750 --> 31:28.458
Then I got to
tell you something.

31:28.542 --> 31:30.291
Um..

31:30.375 --> 31:33.625
The car is not
the only thing that I love.

31:33.709 --> 31:36.291
Uh, I..

31:36.375 --> 31:38.375
...I love you too.

31:38.458 --> 31:40.208
I love you too, kiddo.

31:40.291 --> 31:41.709
No..

31:41.792 --> 31:43.625
...I mean..

31:43.709 --> 31:45.959
...I really love you.

31:54.834 --> 31:57.792
Charlie didn't hit
on me. I hit on him.

31:57.875 --> 32:00.166
That must've surprised Danville.

32:00.250 --> 32:02.834
He was surprised.

32:02.917 --> 32:05.041
But then we fell in love.

32:06.291 --> 32:09.208
- You buy that Mustang?
- Yeah.

32:10.959 --> 32:13.667
Charlie and I drove
all over town in it.

32:13.750 --> 32:16.208
I wanted to spend
the rest of my life with
him.

32:19.500 --> 32:22.875
So the thought
of me killing him..

32:22.959 --> 32:24.959
...it's so crazy.

32:25.041 --> 32:27.208
I loved him.

32:27.291 --> 32:28.875
I still do.

32:37.208 --> 32:39.041
You know how Kip said he
took the train to his mom's

32:39.125 --> 32:40.166
the night Danville died?

32:40.250 --> 32:42.083
- Yeah?
- There's a reason.

32:42.166 --> 32:45.125
I ran all the carjackings
in June of '85.

32:45.208 --> 32:46.917
No Mustangs stolen in Philly.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.333
But in Montgomery County,
where Kip's mom lived..

32:49.417 --> 32:52.417
- Cherry red Mustang?
- Junked and stripped.

32:52.500 --> 32:53.792
- Guess where?
- Ardmore.

32:53.875 --> 32:55.542
Just like all
the other carjackings.

32:55.625 --> 32:57.542
Including Danville's DeLorean.

32:57.625 --> 32:58.959
Pretty amazing coincidence.

32:59.041 --> 33:00.542
How'd they miss this in '85?

33:00.625 --> 33:02.041
Montgomery County
and Philly were like

33:02.125 --> 33:04.083
two separate countries, Scotty.

33:04.166 --> 33:07.542
So maybe Kip's playing us.
<i>alibi.</i>

33:07.625 --> 33:09.875
Let's bring the math
teacher in this time

33:09.959 --> 33:11.625
see whether he
likes our
house.

33:12.625 --> 33:14.417
(Kip)
'This is wrong.'

33:14.500 --> 33:16.417
Why are you doing this to me?

33:17.875 --> 33:18.917
He's excellent.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.083
You sure you don't teach drama?

33:20.166 --> 33:22.667
I-I'm telling you the truth.

33:22.750 --> 33:24.667
I didn't kill Charlie.
Why do you think that?

33:24.750 --> 33:26.583
Well, 'cause your
precious cherry red Mustang

33:26.667 --> 33:28.917
was carjacked a few days
before Charlie was killed.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.875
(Scotty)
'So you knew exactly
how to cover up a murder'

33:30.959 --> 33:32.417
and make it look
like a carjacking.

33:32.500 --> 33:35.542
Was it spur of the moment,
Kip, or premeditated?

33:35.625 --> 33:38.291
I left Charlie
at the Arbitrage alive.

33:38.375 --> 33:41.125
And then I went to the train
station just like I told you.

33:41.208 --> 33:43.041
I believe you left the bar, Kip.

33:43.125 --> 33:45.458
Then you waited outside
for Danville to leave.

33:45.542 --> 33:47.667
Shot him twice, then
took off in his DeLorean.

33:47.750 --> 33:49.083
No, that's not what happened.

33:49.166 --> 33:51.750
So what did happen?

33:51.834 --> 33:55.583
The night he was killed
I...I kept at him.

33:55.667 --> 33:57.834
I confronted him one last time.

34:00.834 --> 34:02.500
Charlie.

34:02.583 --> 34:04.625
Having a
conversation
here, Kip.

34:04.709 --> 34:06.458
I'm not leaving till we talk.

34:14.709 --> 34:16.166
What's bothering you now?

34:16.250 --> 34:19.291
- If you won't help
Livermore--
- Get over Livermore!

34:19.375 --> 34:22.125
At least tell me that
the $50,000 my mom invested

34:22.208 --> 34:23.583
you're not gonna scam her too?

34:23.667 --> 34:26.959
Your mom already received
her return on investment.

34:27.041 --> 34:28.542
What do you mean?

34:28.625 --> 34:30.208
Ask her.

34:30.291 --> 34:32.875
Charlie, you-you're
really confusing me
here.

34:32.959 --> 34:35.583
Is-is my mother gonna
get her money back or
not?

34:35.667 --> 34:37.875
No, Kip, she's not.

34:37.959 --> 34:39.417
But she's my mother.

34:39.500 --> 34:42.250
She's not some
stranger like
Livermore.

34:42.333 --> 34:44.458
I-I thought that
you cared about
us.

34:44.542 --> 34:46.959
- Me.
- I do, kiddo.

34:47.041 --> 34:49.333
That's why you should
listen to me very closely.

34:49.417 --> 34:50.542
This game ain't for you.

34:50.625 --> 34:51.917
Get out while
you're still young.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.667
Go back to the sticks,
become a librarian.

34:54.750 --> 34:57.458
- Or something more your speed.
- You're kidding, right?

34:57.542 --> 34:59.375
I wanted to help you,
but you're just not catching
on.

34:59.458 --> 35:02.250
- Charlie..
- It's over. No sale.

35:02.333 --> 35:04.500
- But I love you.
- Sorry!

35:06.500 --> 35:07.917
So long, kiddo.

35:19.083 --> 35:21.667
I left there crying like a baby.

35:21.750 --> 35:23.917
Never saw Charlie again.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.959
Says you.

35:26.041 --> 35:29.125
I went to my mom's,
like I told you.

35:29.208 --> 35:31.291
<i>alibis</i>

35:31.375 --> 35:33.250
a mother is pretty
close to worthless.

35:33.333 --> 35:36.500
I can't confess to
a murder I didn't commit.

35:36.583 --> 35:38.500
Why don't you believe me?

35:46.458 --> 35:49.917
Well...what are
you doing here?

35:50.000 --> 35:51.166
Kip's in custody for the murder

35:51.250 --> 35:52.917
of Charles Danville, Mavis.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.875
Oh, no. No,
that's not right.

35:55.959 --> 35:57.542
Kip did not do anything.

35:57.625 --> 35:59.667
We know about Kip's
car getting jacked.

35:59.750 --> 36:02.208
So what?
That doesn't prove anything.

36:02.291 --> 36:05.208
- So you knew about that too?
- Well, of course, I knew.

36:05.291 --> 36:06.625
Mavis, there are
ways of
testifying

36:06.709 --> 36:08.792
that could help Kip,
reduce his sentence.

36:08.875 --> 36:11.917
He seems like a decent guy,
jury will respond to that.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.250
"Seems?"

36:14.125 --> 36:15.834
That boy is an angel.

36:15.917 --> 36:17.834
All the same, he
killed
a man in cold blood.

36:17.917 --> 36:20.792
And left him to
die
on the road.

36:20.875 --> 36:23.041
That boy is an angel.

36:23.125 --> 36:25.417
And..

36:25.500 --> 36:29.375
...and Danville...was the Devil.

36:33.333 --> 36:34.417
Oh, I'm sorry, mom.

36:34.500 --> 36:36.083
[crying]
I'm so
sorry.

36:36.166 --> 36:38.417
I don't care about the money.

36:39.709 --> 36:41.834
I loved him.

36:41.917 --> 36:43.208
I know.

36:43.291 --> 36:45.083
No, I mean..

36:45.166 --> 36:47.625
...I really, really loved him.

36:50.417 --> 36:51.959
You mean..

36:53.291 --> 36:55.250
...you and him?

36:57.208 --> 36:58.500
Yeah.

37:00.375 --> 37:02.625
God, he used me and then

37:02.709 --> 37:04.834
spit me out like I was nothing.

37:04.917 --> 37:07.625
He told me that I wasn't
cut out for the business

37:07.709 --> 37:11.458
and just....just go back
to the vegetable patch.

37:12.709 --> 37:14.333
It's okay.

37:14.417 --> 37:16.375
'It's okay, baby.'

37:18.375 --> 37:20.125
It's okay.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.333
Hello, Charlie.

37:44.417 --> 37:47.375
Mavis? Ha ha.
What are you doing here?

37:47.458 --> 37:51.041
Called the bar, made sure you
were still here getting
sauced.

37:52.834 --> 37:55.417
- What do you want?
- You.

37:55.500 --> 37:56.834
Again?

37:59.000 --> 38:01.500
I didn't give you enough
of a workout the other night?

38:01.583 --> 38:03.834
Yeah, that was business.

38:03.917 --> 38:06.709
You had to close a deal.

38:06.792 --> 38:08.166
What, you're sore
about the money?

38:08.250 --> 38:10.000
Forget the money.

38:12.291 --> 38:14.291
I want you.

38:15.542 --> 38:16.834
Look, Mavis..

38:16.917 --> 38:18.917
...I'm a little tired.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.959
Whoa, whoa, whoa, now..

38:21.041 --> 38:22.458
I'm an adult.

38:22.542 --> 38:23.875
I got no one
but myself to blame

38:23.959 --> 38:27.542
for sleeping with
a cold-blooded reptile like
you.

38:28.583 --> 38:30.375
But Kip's just a kid.

38:30.458 --> 38:32.375
- He's in his 20s.
- He's a baby.

38:32.458 --> 38:34.250
Look, why don't you just
put the gun away, okay?

38:34.333 --> 38:35.667
We'll talk the whole
thing through.

38:35.750 --> 38:38.500
Sleeping with
a mother and her son

38:38.583 --> 38:40.875
that's as low as it gets.

38:40.959 --> 38:41.875
Kip doesn't have to know.

38:41.959 --> 38:44.250
He's never gonna know anything.

38:44.333 --> 38:46.834
Just that you got
what was coming to you..

38:47.500 --> 38:49.583
...kiddo.
