HE ALLEVIATED THE GUILT WHEN
HE CONFESSED TO AGENT MORETTI.

19:24.234 --> 19:27.397
AND THE GUILT AND THE HEADACHES
CAME BACK AFTER HE RECANTED,

19:27.397 --> 19:31.741
SO I URGED HIM TO TURN
HIMSELF IN, AND HE AGREED.

WITH THAT TERM, EITHER.

19:40.950 --> 19:43.683
UH, TREAT THE MIND,

19:43.683 --> 19:46.386
I'VE DEVELOPED

AND BLOOD FLOW IN THE BRAIN.

19:49.259 --> 19:52.492

YOU CURED PHIL'S CANCER?

19:59.269 --> 20:01.901
NO. NO, NO. HE DID THAT
ON HIS OWN WITH MY METHODS.

IT ALWAYS HAS TO COME
FROM THE PATIENT.

I REALIZE THAT, TO SOME PEOPLE,
MY METHODS MAY SEEM FARFETCHED,

20:12.282 --> 20:16.346
BUT PHIL'S CURE IS PROOF THAT
THE WORK WE DID HERE PAID OFF.

20:16.346 --> 20:19.519
YOU DIDN'T CURE HIM.
THE CHEMOTHERAPY CURED HIM.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.851
NO, CHEMOTHERAPY
ALMOST KILLED HIM.

20:21.851 --> 20:24.294

TO STOP THOSE TREATMENTS.

WHO MIGHT HAVE
WANTED TO HARM PHIL?

20:33.533 --> 20:35.865

HE WAS RELUCTANT

20:35.865 --> 20:37.236
IN CONFESSING HIS CRIMES

20:37.236 --> 20:39.569
BECAUSE HE HAD
A GIRLFRIEND IN '92.

20:39.569 --> 20:43.813
HE SAID HE WAS AFRAID SHE'D GET
IN TROUBLE IF HE CAME FORWARD.

20:43.813 --> 20:45.915
I SUGGESTED
THAT HE TALK TO HER,

20:45.915 --> 20:47.777

HE WAS CONFESSING HIS CRIMES.

THAT PHIL PAID YOU A VISIT,

WAS GONNA GIVE YOU,

FROM THE PROFITS OF THIS BOOK?

28:34.013 --> 28:36.886
HE SAID HE THOUGHT
IT WAS ONLY RIGHT...

THAT THE MONEY
SHOULD GO TO ME.

IF PHIL WAS TRUE TO HIS WORD
ABOUT SCRAPPING THE BOOK,

THAT WOULD MAKE

ABOUT THE BOOK?

29:19.758 --> 29:21.430
