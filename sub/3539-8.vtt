- I barely remember.

12:19.663 --> 12:21.496

the Spitalfields murders.

12:25.102 --> 12:27.202

that he...

12:27.287 --> 12:29.838
"Stop hunting for a man

12:30.791 --> 12:32.674
and start hunting
for a beast."

12:42.085 --> 12:43.184
I don't recall.

12:45.522 --> 12:48.773
The whole thing was, um...
[clears throat] a caprice.

12:48.809 --> 12:50.558
- A caprice?
- Something like that.

12:50.560 --> 12:52.110
You don't seem...

12:53.530 --> 12:55.230
- a capricious man.
- Don't I?

12:56.283 --> 12:58.366
You have a tripod of rifles
at your window.

12:58.401 --> 13:00.869
Well, can't I decorate
my own house as I see fit?

13:01.872 --> 13:03.288
Any way you like.

13:04.908 --> 13:06.958

- What?

13:08.962 --> 13:10.829
No. I have...

13:12.249 --> 13:13.915
a ward and my man Sembene.

13:13.917 --> 13:15.834
- Other servants?
- No.

13:15.886 --> 13:17.252
In a house this large?

13:18.088 --> 13:19.137
We make do.

13:19.973 --> 13:21.589
You have a front door
made of steel.

13:22.425 --> 13:24.225
There have been robberies
in the neighborhood.

13:24.261 --> 13:25.593
Oh, I'm so sorry.

13:26.997 --> 13:28.897

keep out a beast,

I'm not to be trifled with.

13:32.759 --> 13:36.152
You filed a missing persons report
on June 12th last year.

13:37.095 --> 13:38.565
Your daughter, Mina.

13:39.918 --> 13:40.496
Yes.

You visited Scotland Yard
7 times in the next 6 weeks.

13:44.019 --> 13:46.419
- And then you stopped coming.
- Yes.

13:47.956 --> 13:49.756
Might I ask why?

13:52.344 --> 13:53.426
My daughter's deceased.

13:53.479 --> 13:55.095
I know.
I have the burial records

13:55.147 --> 13:57.848
from Margate,
dated January the 4th.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.100
But there was
no death certificate filed

14:00.152 --> 14:01.601
with the Magistrate.

14:01.603 --> 14:02.769
It was a private affair.

14:02.805 --> 14:06.573
There are no private burials
in this country, sir.

14:06.608 --> 14:07.674
Title or not.

14:07.709 --> 14:09.242
The circumstances of her death

14:09.278 --> 14:10.527
were embarrassing
to my family,

14:10.579 --> 14:12.879
I used my influence
to ensure discretion.

14:14.833 --> 14:16.149
That is illegal.

14:17.452 --> 14:19.085
She was my daughter.

14:19.121 --> 14:20.587
Well, many people have
daughters and obey the law.

14:20.622 --> 14:22.122
Well, I didn't!

14:35.838 --> 14:36.970
You know him.

14:39.241 --> 14:40.874
- No.
- Look closely.

14:44.897 --> 14:46.196
Means nothing.

14:46.899 --> 14:48.031
Is he a suspect?

14:48.066 --> 14:49.950
You're sure
you don't recognize him?

14:49.985 --> 14:51.318
Entirely sure.

14:52.988 --> 14:54.287
Are you confident
in that answer?

14:54.323 --> 14:55.789
Would you like
to summon a lawyer

14:55.824 --> 14:56.907
and take a deposition?

14:56.959 --> 14:58.158
In time.

15:00.629 --> 15:02.295
Should you come
across anything

15:02.331 --> 15:03.697
that would aid
in our investigation,

15:03.732 --> 15:05.966
don't hesitate
to stop by Scotland Yard.

15:07.836 --> 15:09.052
You know the way.

15:11.940 --> 15:13.807
Good day, Sir Malcolm.

20:16.139 --> 20:19.140

and to my children,

20:19.142 --> 20:21.860

in the process...

20:26.483 --> 20:27.532

"In the great war for
the Heavenly Throne,

22:32.859 --> 22:33.942

on His defeated angels

evil angels,

22:38.281 --> 22:40.532

He took us by our winged backs
and raised us over His head.

22:43.887 --> 22:46.387

from His Heavenly Throne

22:56.550 --> 22:58.766
And now the rest of the tale.

"So we were cleaved apart...

23:02.973 --> 23:07.308

23:07.360 --> 23:10.645
One brother to Earth
and the other brother to Hell.

And myself in Hell to feed
on the souls of the dead.

for the Mother of Evil

from our bondage

to reconquer Heaven

from his bloody throne.

reign, on Earth, in Heaven...

Lucifer isn't an only child.

23:58.995 --> 24:00.778

they don't get along.

24:00.830 --> 24:02.330

Is that the vampire Master
that captured Mina?

24:05.368 --> 24:08.369
And all those he creates
in his image.

24:08.371 --> 24:10.955
He tried to lure Vanessa
through Mina.

- Lucifer, banished to Hell.

34:48.594 --> 34:49.944
[Sembene] Sir Malcolm?

34:57.320 --> 34:59.103
Sir Malcolm has gone.

35:00.022 --> 35:02.189
We need to find Miss Ives
and Mr. Chandler.

36:25.024 --> 36:26.023
So...

36:28.411 --> 36:30.494
you've discovered my secret.

36:34.016 --> 36:35.783
Forever unchanging.

36:37.954 --> 36:40.254
My sins made manifest
only here.

36:43.676 --> 36:46.293
At times, I've deceived myself
into thinking, uh...

36:47.797 --> 36:49.263
I'm other than this.

36:52.468 --> 36:53.884
Don't we all want to
paint ourselves

36:53.936 --> 36:55.803
into something...

36:55.805 --> 36:57.438
better than we are?

36:59.859 --> 37:01.225
But that...

37:04.313 --> 37:06.480
is who I truly am, Angelique.

37:13.155 --> 37:15.205
Can you accept me as I am?

37:19.662 --> 37:21.128
Can you love me?

37:23.799 --> 37:24.832
Yes.

- [floorboards creaking]

39:17.830 --> 39:19.947
Mr. Clare, you startled me.

39:25.254 --> 39:27.121
I don't... I don't think
it's entirely proper

39:27.123 --> 39:29.373
that you should be here
without Victor.

39:30.259 --> 39:32.459
Perhaps you should
come back another time.

39:35.848 --> 39:37.381
Why are you so quiet?

39:38.801 --> 39:41.135
You're never usually
at a loss for words.

39:41.554 --> 39:44.354
Aren't there some verses
you could recite?

39:47.026 --> 39:48.892
Stop pretending
you're frightened.

39:49.812 --> 39:50.944
[voice shuddering]
Please leave.

39:53.149 --> 39:54.565
Who are you?

39:55.034 --> 39:57.201
What... What do you mean?

39:57.953 --> 39:59.903
Who are you?

39:59.955 --> 40:01.488
Honestly, I think
you're more able

40:01.490 --> 40:03.991
to answer
that question than I.

40:03.993 --> 40:06.827
My past is unknown to me,
as well you know.

40:06.879 --> 40:07.995
Is it?

40:09.798 --> 40:11.465
[Lily]
What are you talking about?

40:13.502 --> 40:15.586
[Mr. Clare]
Did you enjoy your evening?

40:16.055 --> 40:17.137
What?

40:17.923 --> 40:19.306
With that young man.

40:20.226 --> 40:21.842
Were you spying on me?

40:21.844 --> 40:23.594
Did you enjoy your evening?

40:23.679 --> 40:26.930
Yes, I did. Now, please leave.

40:26.982 --> 40:28.849
This behavior is
really insupportable!

40:28.901 --> 40:31.018
- When Victor hears of this...
- There is no Victor!

40:31.053 --> 40:32.603
- [Lily gasps]
- There is no young man!

40:32.655 --> 40:34.988
- There is thee and me!
- All right! Very well!

40:35.024 --> 40:37.524
What in God's name
do you want of me?

40:37.576 --> 40:40.827
What I want I cannot have.
You're incapable of it.

40:40.863 --> 40:42.913
Yes, I know.

40:45.668 --> 40:48.068
You want to walk
in the village

40:48.103 --> 40:50.337
and hold my hand.

40:50.372 --> 40:51.605
And when people are cruel,

40:51.640 --> 40:54.041
you want me to love you
even more.

40:55.911 --> 40:57.144
Do I hurt you?

40:58.280 --> 40:59.413
[Lily scoffs]

41:02.818 --> 41:06.153
How can you imagine
that I could care for you?

41:07.223 --> 41:10.774
Does that face
belong alongside this?

41:12.978 --> 41:15.229
Doesn't the world smile on us?

41:16.198 --> 41:18.315
Don't we make
a beautiful couple,

41:18.367 --> 41:19.783
"thee and me"?

41:19.818 --> 41:22.152
Shall we wander the pastures
and recite

41:22.204 --> 41:24.738
your fucking poetry
to the fucking cows?

41:24.790 --> 41:26.573
You are blind...

41:27.543 --> 41:29.243
like all other men.

41:29.295 --> 41:30.911
And you are unlike
all other women.

41:31.630 --> 41:33.080
[both grunt]

41:34.633 --> 41:36.049
You tell me how.

41:38.921 --> 41:41.722
We flatter our men
with our pain.

41:42.675 --> 41:44.758
We bow before them.

41:44.760 --> 41:48.312
We make ourselves dolls
for their amusement.

41:48.347 --> 41:52.182
We lose our dignity in corsets
and high shoes

41:52.234 --> 41:54.818
and gossip
and the slavery of marriage!

41:54.853 --> 41:56.436
And our reward
for this service?

41:57.690 --> 41:59.072
[voice breaking]
The back of the hand...

42:01.076 --> 42:03.694

42:03.746 --> 42:05.946
the bloody, aching cunt

42:05.998 --> 42:08.081
as you force us onto your beds

42:08.117 --> 42:09.783
to take your
fat, heaving bodies!

42:09.818 --> 42:11.251
[crying]

42:11.287 --> 42:13.503
You drag us into the alleys,
my lad,

42:13.539 --> 42:16.173
and cram yourselves
into our mouths for two bob

42:16.759 --> 42:19.126
when you're
not beating us senseless!

42:19.178 --> 42:21.428
When we're not bloody
from the eyes,

42:21.463 --> 42:23.797
and the mouth, and the ass
and the cunt!

42:23.849 --> 42:24.798
[Mr. Clare grunting]

[both panting]

42:33.442 --> 42:34.641
Never again...

42:37.363 --> 42:40.981
will I kneel to any man.

42:44.236 --> 42:46.370
Now they shall kneel to me.

42:49.074 --> 42:50.791
As you do, monster.

42:50.826 --> 42:52.159
[trembling]

My monster.

43:00.419 --> 43:02.636
My beautiful corpse.

43:08.227 --> 43:11.178
How clever he's been,
our creator.

43:14.149 --> 43:15.565
But our little god...

43:16.602 --> 43:18.852
has brought forth
not angels...

43:20.406 --> 43:21.738
but demons.

43:23.025 --> 43:24.825
Thee and me.

43:28.530 --> 43:31.531
And what should we do
with this power, undead thing?

43:33.285 --> 43:35.869
You're a thoughtful man,
a philosopher even.

43:35.921 --> 43:39.172
So tell me, why do we exist?

43:41.260 --> 43:43.710
Why have we been chosen?
Tell me.

43:46.932 --> 43:48.048
I don't know.

43:50.302 --> 43:51.885
Is it to suffer?

43:54.723 --> 43:55.722
Yes.

44:00.062 --> 44:01.278
Must it be?

44:02.598 --> 44:04.131
How can it be other?

44:05.934 --> 44:07.567
We long
for that we cannot have.

44:08.103 --> 44:09.236
Women?

44:10.105 --> 44:12.406
I'll bring you a dozen.
We'll fuck 'em together.

44:16.145 --> 44:17.210
Me?

44:21.417 --> 44:23.300
Then you shall have me.

44:26.171 --> 44:27.587
I want you.

44:29.057 --> 44:30.323
[Mr. Clare shuddering]

44:31.760 --> 44:36.062
I want a man
unlike all other men.

44:36.648 --> 44:37.681
My brother,

44:38.767 --> 44:40.233
my equal.

44:42.020 --> 44:43.236
I'll take you...

44:45.107 --> 44:46.606

to my bed right now.

44:52.614 --> 44:54.581
I'll bleed for you.

44:55.784 --> 44:57.284
I'll love you...

44:58.954 --> 45:00.504
for your sadness...

45:01.790 --> 45:04.124
and your poetry
and your passion

45:04.176 --> 45:05.425
and your rage

45:05.928 --> 45:10.046
and your infinite,
luxurious ugliness.

45:11.216 --> 45:13.216
I'll lick your sins away.

45:16.221 --> 45:17.637
[Mr. Clare panting]

45:21.376 --> 45:23.443
And when Victor comes home...

45:26.865 --> 45:30.150
we'll put our hands
around his throat together...

45:31.870 --> 45:33.570
and watch him die.

45:35.874 --> 45:38.124
And then this will be
our home.

45:40.045 --> 45:41.328
And then?

45:43.215 --> 45:45.165
What then, undead thing?

45:49.171 --> 45:52.589
We were created to rule,
my love.

45:54.176 --> 45:58.512
And the blood of mankind
will water our garden.

46:00.015 --> 46:02.232
Us and our kin...

46:03.151 --> 46:04.518
and our children,

46:04.570 --> 46:06.436
and our generations.

46:07.656 --> 46:09.439
We are the conquerors.

46:10.859 --> 46:13.410
We are the pure blood.

46:13.445 --> 46:17.197
We are steel and sinew both.

46:17.199 --> 46:19.699
We are the next 1000 years.

46:20.419 --> 46:22.168

47:11.553 --> 47:14.170

in our lives.

47:15.223 --> 47:17.090
All of these <i>memento mori...</i>

47:18.477 --> 47:20.260
for one sobering message...

47:21.530 --> 47:23.730
"Remember that you will die."

47:25.734 --> 47:28.168
- What do you want of me?
- You see, darling,

47:29.371 --> 47:31.771
I understand hunting as well.

47:31.807 --> 47:34.174
Though I've never been
to your beloved Africa.

47:35.310 --> 47:39.112
Sometimes you tie a lamb
to lure a lion, don't you?

47:40.315 --> 47:42.716
So all I require of you
is that you...

47:43.752 --> 47:45.118
[mimics sheep bleating]

47:47.556 --> 47:48.755
Why Miss Ives?

47:48.790 --> 47:50.090
Because the Master
desires her.

47:50.892 --> 47:52.125
It's not personal...

47:53.028 --> 47:54.494
it's goods and services.

47:55.297 --> 47:56.796
I supply him
with what he wants,

47:56.832 --> 47:59.132
he supplies me
with what I want.

47:59.167 --> 48:00.367
It's tit for tat, Sir M.

48:00.402 --> 48:02.102
And what does he give you?

48:03.205 --> 48:04.404
No, Malcolm...

48:06.141 --> 48:07.207
us.

48:08.477 --> 48:10.677
Eternal life, eternal beauty.

48:11.446 --> 48:13.380
Such shallow pursuits.

48:13.982 --> 48:17.050
What value do they hold
if we walk always alone?

48:20.222 --> 48:22.122
I've been too much alone...

48:23.392 --> 48:27.460
and this house is... so cold.

48:28.830 --> 48:32.032
But with you,
I've found a kind of elation.

48:33.168 --> 48:36.036
To feel
the old touch of passion.

48:36.071 --> 48:37.554
To yearn.

48:40.058 --> 48:41.474
To be truly human.

48:41.510 --> 48:44.644
My humanity, such as it is,
is colder than this house.

48:44.680 --> 48:45.745
No.

48:47.149 --> 48:49.115
No arrogance or pride.

48:50.318 --> 48:53.319
This is your chance
to live, Malcolm.

And together
we will walk quietly.

So quietly.

49:25.387 --> 49:26.686
You know, if I could,

49:27.222 --> 49:29.773
I would tear
that beautiful head

49:29.808 --> 49:34.527
from your shoulders
and laugh all the while.

49:38.233 --> 49:40.400

Miss Ives live,

49:43.622 --> 49:45.955
I will walk with you
to the end of time.

She means so much?

49:49.494 --> 49:51.044
She means all.

It's the one thing
I cannot do.

49:57.753 --> 49:59.969
The Master will have her.

Then when I have played
this game out, my dear...

You're so very close
after all.

she is?

50:25.313 --> 50:26.346
Yes.

50:27.649 --> 50:31.417
Yeah. You watched her
rather carefully, I'd say.

50:31.453 --> 50:32.452
Did I?

50:36.591 --> 50:38.258
Of course you did.

She was always your favorite.
