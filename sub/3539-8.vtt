00:00.100 --> 00:02.025
[Vanessa] <i>Previously on
Penny Dreadful...</i>

00:02.027 --> 00:03.425
Your wife took her own life.

00:03.427 --> 00:05.194
That doesn't seem like her.

00:05.196 --> 00:06.629
It's like he doesn't care.

00:06.631 --> 00:08.964
[Sembene] <i>When he found
his son dead, I was there.</i>

00:08.966 --> 00:10.566
<i>This is not him.</i>

00:10.568 --> 00:13.068
- Maybe he just needs time.
- This... is not him.

00:13.070 --> 00:14.870
[Madame Kali] <i>I banished
the old bear to the cave</i>

00:14.872 --> 00:16.172
and lured out the cub.

00:16.174 --> 00:17.273
I feel like a new man.

00:17.275 --> 00:18.874
[Madame Kali]
<i>Only Miss Ives matters.</i>

00:18.876 --> 00:21.877
Time comes when the spider
must touch the fly.

00:21.879 --> 00:22.944
[Rusk] <i>"Whodunit?"</i>

00:22.946 --> 00:24.345
- [Ethan] <i>Inspector.</i>
- [Rusk] <i>Mr. Chandler.</i>

00:24.347 --> 00:25.814
[whispering]
I know you're involved.

00:25.816 --> 00:27.615
- And your proof?
- I'll find it.

00:27.617 --> 00:29.317
I always find it.

00:29.319 --> 00:31.019
I need to leave.
London isn't safe.

00:31.021 --> 00:31.987
I'll go with you.

00:33.089 --> 00:35.657
Enough. Whatever power
you held over me

00:35.659 --> 00:38.693
at the moment of
my bestial creation is gone.

00:38.695 --> 00:40.361
<i>I will see her.</i>

00:40.363 --> 00:42.363
She thinks you were her fiance
before the "accident"

00:42.365 --> 00:43.764
that robbed her of her memory.

00:43.766 --> 00:47.168
Let us start by being friends,
Mr. Clare. I can do no other.

00:47.170 --> 00:48.336
To my dear Angelique.

00:48.338 --> 00:50.838
And a special welcome
to Miss Frankenstein.

00:50.840 --> 00:52.173
Cheers.

00:52.175 --> 00:53.675
[Lily]
<i>My cousin is protective.</i>

00:53.752 --> 00:55.201
I don't think you need
much protection.

00:55.254 --> 00:57.871
<i>You are more capable
than you perhaps appear.</i>

00:57.923 --> 00:58.972

01:29.621 --> 01:31.371
You're a very silly boy.

01:33.625 --> 01:35.408
That's what I like about you.

01:37.713 --> 01:41.131
Men should always
remain boys at heart.

01:41.166 --> 01:43.550
Filled with childish games,

01:45.087 --> 01:49.055
with Snakes and Ladders
and blindman's bluff.

01:51.476 --> 01:55.095
How sad that boys feel
they must grow up.

01:57.899 --> 02:00.183
[breathes deeply]

02:03.071 --> 02:05.105
You'll never grow up now.

Where is Lily?

[retching]

04:39.394 --> 04:40.593
She's not here?

04:47.352 --> 04:50.069
You let her go out
with a man by herself.

04:50.105 --> 04:52.539
- [grunts] What have you done?
- Stop it!

04:52.607 --> 04:54.607
Just stop! Give me a moment.

04:55.193 --> 04:58.778
[gasping]
She... Yes, she went out.

04:59.447 --> 05:02.248
She was meant
to come home and...

05:02.284 --> 05:03.533
[exclaiming]

05:03.585 --> 05:05.034
[breathing heavily]

05:06.788 --> 05:08.204
You made her for me.

05:10.041 --> 05:11.457
[Frankenstein whimpers]

05:12.043 --> 05:14.844
She is mine.
She is not yours.

05:15.847 --> 05:18.131
She is not his.
She is mine.

05:19.568 --> 05:21.067
I will take her!

05:22.687 --> 05:24.137
[Frankenstein grunts]

05:26.858 --> 05:29.809
And when we are gone,
far away from this place

05:30.512 --> 05:32.812
to a place
for she and me alone,

05:33.782 --> 05:36.716
I will return... Creator.

05:37.819 --> 05:40.153
I will return to you.

05:43.291 --> 05:44.657
One day...

05:45.243 --> 05:46.259
one night...

05:48.163 --> 05:51.331
I will show you the monster
you have made.

05:59.174 --> 06:01.808
[junior inspector]
Sir, you should see this.

06:03.011 --> 06:04.093
Inspector Galsworthy's

06:04.145 --> 06:05.845
appointment book
from last year.

06:05.847 --> 06:08.064
Note the listing
for September 27.

06:11.319 --> 06:13.236
Why would Sir Malcolm Murray
of all people

06:13.271 --> 06:14.520
visit Scotland Yard?

06:14.522 --> 06:15.688
That's what I thought,

06:15.740 --> 06:18.024
so I did a bit of digging
into the records.

06:24.532 --> 06:26.282
Seems I've a call to make.

06:29.671 --> 06:30.870
[Lyle]
I gave that up long ago.

06:33.675 --> 06:35.208
It was too embarrassing.

06:37.262 --> 06:40.463
Forever trying to remain fit
with rubdowns

06:41.683 --> 06:44.467
and medicine balls
and glandular injections,

06:46.221 --> 06:48.972
while always around me
there were more handsome men

06:49.024 --> 06:51.190
who had the thrill
of genuine youth.

06:53.728 --> 06:56.729
Guardsmen in shining uniforms

06:57.983 --> 07:00.566
and stable hands
with thick arms.

07:03.989 --> 07:05.038
Yes.

07:05.073 --> 07:06.155
[Madame Kali chuckles]

07:06.207 --> 07:08.825
I admit to vanity about
my complexion and hair color.

07:08.877 --> 07:11.244
What harm there, really?

07:11.296 --> 07:13.329
Do I render myself foolish?

07:13.381 --> 07:14.414
Well, hang a man for that

07:14.466 --> 07:16.382
and it'll be
a very crowded gallows.

07:19.504 --> 07:21.087
But then there's you.

07:22.974 --> 07:25.758
Quite a different paean
to youth we sing there.

07:26.678 --> 07:28.428
Well, we will sing it,
won't we?

07:28.480 --> 07:29.512
Oh, yes.

07:29.564 --> 07:32.649
The sword you dangle
over my head would cut deeply.

07:48.333 --> 07:50.283
You don't imagine you care
for those people?

07:51.619 --> 07:54.337
For Miss Ives and that
sorry lot at Grandage Place?

07:54.372 --> 07:56.506
I have long since given up
caring for anyone.

07:56.541 --> 07:57.957
Very sensible.

07:58.760 --> 08:00.460
Your future...

08:00.512 --> 08:03.463
rests entirely with me,
my dear friend.

08:04.182 --> 08:06.299
Whatever you desire,
the Master can give you.

08:06.301 --> 08:08.634
You don't need to tempt me,
I'm your creature.

08:12.774 --> 08:14.023
Where are Miss Ives
and Mr. Chandler?

08:14.059 --> 08:15.942
I don't know.
She wouldn't say.

08:17.779 --> 08:19.812
- When will they return?
- I've no idea.

08:20.815 --> 08:22.315
Does Mr. Chandler love her?

08:22.984 --> 08:23.950
Do you?

08:24.953 --> 08:26.202
[scoffs]

08:26.237 --> 08:28.821
- Does she love him?
- She's opaque.

08:29.491 --> 08:32.041
And you've absolutely no idea
where they've run off to?

08:32.077 --> 08:33.208
None.

08:35.246 --> 08:36.629
[gasps fearfully]

08:36.664 --> 08:39.332
- Are you telling me the truth?
- Yes.

08:39.384 --> 08:41.417
I can feel your blood pumping.

08:41.469 --> 08:44.754
The most minute pressure
and the artery is open to me.

08:44.806 --> 08:47.673
Your blood would paint
this room.

08:47.675 --> 08:49.225
[shuddering]

08:51.046 --> 08:52.011
Ah.

08:53.815 --> 08:55.398
I know you're not lying.

08:56.684 --> 08:58.434
You always bat your eyelashes
most coquettishly

08:58.486 --> 08:59.852
when you lie.
[chuckles]

09:01.106 --> 09:02.855
Ah, well, then, [sighs]

09:02.857 --> 09:05.024
if Miss Ives
has gone to ground,

09:05.076 --> 09:07.326
I shall have to lure her back.

09:10.081 --> 09:11.330
Kiss me and go.

09:12.584 --> 09:14.033
I'm bored with you.

09:18.289 --> 09:19.372
No.

09:27.799 --> 09:29.215
[Lyle gasps]

09:39.227 --> 09:41.527
You taste like
a fat little man.

09:57.245 --> 09:58.628
[breathing shakily]

10:19.801 --> 10:21.834
- [Lyle yelps]
- What did she say?

10:23.905 --> 10:26.606
Ask her yourself.

10:26.658 --> 10:29.158
I am not so sentimental
as my mother.

10:30.445 --> 10:32.445
Where is the future, Mr. Lyle?

10:33.081 --> 10:35.114
With her age or my youth?

10:36.618 --> 10:38.918
Whatever she promises you
is a lie.

10:38.953 --> 10:41.621
Whatever I promise you
is a lie

10:41.673 --> 10:43.623
but you'll live longer
with me.

10:45.877 --> 10:48.794
Now... tell me
about Mr. Chandler.

10:57.305 --> 11:04.586
[young Mina]
<i>Did you catch one?</i>

11:04.621 --> 11:06.171
[young Peter]
<i>In Africa? Really?</i>

11:07.190 --> 11:09.341
- [knocking at door]
- Come in.

11:14.431 --> 11:16.798
There's a gentleman here
for you...

11:16.850 --> 11:18.466
from Scotland Yard.

11:27.377 --> 11:28.727
How do you do, Sir Malcolm?

11:28.779 --> 11:30.862
My name is
Inspector Bartholomew Rusk,

11:30.897 --> 11:32.147
Scotland Yard.

11:34.785 --> 11:36.785
Inspector, to what
do I owe the pleasure?

11:36.820 --> 11:39.537
You have a martial sense
in decoration, Sir Malcolm.

11:39.573 --> 11:41.322
Apparently, I do.

11:41.324 --> 11:42.657
Please, take a seat.

11:43.243 --> 11:44.626
What can I do for you,
Inspector?

11:44.661 --> 11:46.578
Are you interested
in criminology?

11:46.630 --> 11:49.164
What? No. Not especially.

11:49.216 --> 11:50.248
- No?
- No.

11:51.084 --> 11:53.168
[Rusk] I didn't mean it
as an insinuation of any sort.

11:53.587 --> 11:57.088
Many people are intrigued by
the morbid events in our city.

11:57.674 --> 11:59.257
Why are you here, Inspector?

11:59.309 --> 12:02.010
I should like to know why
you visited Scotland Yard

12:02.012 --> 12:04.145
on September the 27th
last year

12:04.181 --> 12:06.598
to speak with
my predecessor...

12:06.650 --> 12:08.433
Inspector Galsworthy.

12:09.186 --> 12:10.819
Oh, yes, that.

12:12.189 --> 12:14.355
Rather whimsical
sort of thing actually.

12:16.526 --> 12:19.577
- What did you talk about?
- I barely remember.

12:19.663 --> 12:21.496
I spoke to him an hour ago.

12:21.531 --> 12:23.915
You asked him about
the Spitalfields murders.

12:25.102 --> 12:27.202
You were quite insistent
that he...

12:27.287 --> 12:29.838
"Stop hunting for a man

12:30.791 --> 12:32.674
and start hunting
for a beast."

12:39.282 --> 12:40.482
Why would you say that?

12:42.085 --> 12:43.184
I don't recall.

12:45.522 --> 12:48.773
The whole thing was, um...
[clears throat] a caprice.

12:48.809 --> 12:50.558
- A caprice?
- Something like that.

12:50.560 --> 12:52.110
You don't seem...

12:53.530 --> 12:55.230
- a capricious man.
- Don't I?

12:56.283 --> 12:58.366
You have a tripod of rifles
at your window.

12:58.401 --> 13:00.869
Well, can't I decorate
my own house as I see fit?

13:01.872 --> 13:03.288
Any way you like.

13:04.908 --> 13:06.958
- Do you live here alone?
- What?

13:08.962 --> 13:10.829
No. I have...

13:12.249 --> 13:13.915
a ward and my man Sembene.

13:13.917 --> 13:15.834
- Other servants?
- No.

13:15.886 --> 13:17.252
In a house this large?

13:18.088 --> 13:19.137
We make do.

13:19.973 --> 13:21.589
You have a front door
made of steel.

13:22.425 --> 13:24.225
There have been robberies
in the neighborhood.

13:24.261 --> 13:25.593
Oh, I'm so sorry.

13:26.997 --> 13:28.897
That door could
keep out a beast,

13:28.932 --> 13:29.931
wouldn't you say?

13:29.983 --> 13:32.724
Inspector Rusk,
I'm not to be trifled with.

13:32.759 --> 13:36.152
You filed a missing persons report
on June 12th last year.

13:37.095 --> 13:38.565
Your daughter, Mina.

13:39.918 --> 13:40.496
Yes.

13:40.531 --> 13:43.659
You visited Scotland Yard
7 times in the next 6 weeks.

13:44.019 --> 13:46.419
- And then you stopped coming.
- Yes.

13:47.956 --> 13:49.756
Might I ask why?

13:52.344 --> 13:53.426
My daughter's deceased.

13:53.479 --> 13:55.095
I know.
I have the burial records

13:55.147 --> 13:57.848
from Margate,
dated January the 4th.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.100
But there was
no death certificate filed

14:00.152 --> 14:01.601
with the Magistrate.

14:01.603 --> 14:02.769
It was a private affair.

14:02.805 --> 14:06.573
There are no private burials
in this country, sir.

14:06.608 --> 14:07.674
Title or not.

14:07.709 --> 14:09.242
The circumstances of her death

14:09.278 --> 14:10.527
were embarrassing
to my family,

14:10.579 --> 14:12.879
I used my influence
to ensure discretion.

14:14.833 --> 14:16.149
That is illegal.

14:17.452 --> 14:19.085
She was my daughter.

14:19.121 --> 14:20.587
Well, many people have
daughters and obey the law.

14:20.622 --> 14:22.122
Well, I didn't!

14:35.838 --> 14:36.970
You know him.

14:39.241 --> 14:40.874
- No.
- Look closely.

14:41.710 --> 14:44.227
American.
6'3", I would say.

14:44.897 --> 14:46.196
Means nothing.

14:46.899 --> 14:48.031
Is he a suspect?

14:48.066 --> 14:49.950
You're sure
you don't recognize him?

14:49.985 --> 14:51.318
Entirely sure.

14:52.988 --> 14:54.287
Are you confident
in that answer?

14:54.323 --> 14:55.789
Would you like
to summon a lawyer

14:55.824 --> 14:56.907
and take a deposition?

14:56.959 --> 14:58.158
In time.

15:00.629 --> 15:02.295
Should you come
across anything

15:02.331 --> 15:03.697
that would aid
in our investigation,

15:03.732 --> 15:05.966
don't hesitate
to stop by Scotland Yard.

15:07.836 --> 15:09.052
You know the way.

15:11.940 --> 15:13.807
Good day, Sir Malcolm.

15:28.919 --> 15:30.769
- [door slams]
- [Lily] Victor!

15:30.821 --> 15:32.154
[breathing heavily]

15:36.694 --> 15:38.860
- Where have you been?
- I'm so sorry.

15:39.697 --> 15:40.996
I know you must
have been worried.

15:41.031 --> 15:42.614
You'll hardly believe it.

15:43.283 --> 15:46.118
- What happened to my curtains?
- Lily, where have you been?

15:47.621 --> 15:49.671
First, kiss me good morning

15:49.707 --> 15:52.257
like my true friend
and calm yourself.

15:54.344 --> 15:55.594
[chuckles]

15:58.298 --> 16:03.685
I had a most entertaining
evening with Mr. Gray.

16:03.721 --> 16:05.103
We went to a waxworks.

16:05.139 --> 16:06.938
Have you ever been
to one of those?

16:07.691 --> 16:10.142
- Yes.
- Well, after that...

16:11.361 --> 16:13.228
I just felt like taking a walk

16:13.280 --> 16:14.696
and I completely
lost track of time.

16:14.732 --> 16:19.067
Finally, I got so tired that
I sat on a bench in Hyde Park

16:19.153 --> 16:21.620
to rest my feet and... [sighs]

16:21.655 --> 16:23.438
next thing I knew
it was morning.

16:24.374 --> 16:26.742
I could have been murdered
in my sleep.

16:30.798 --> 16:32.714
Did you get me flowers?

16:33.300 --> 16:36.334
Victor, you are such
a good friend.

16:37.221 --> 16:38.720
They're not from me.

16:39.890 --> 16:41.056
[chuckles]

16:41.759 --> 16:42.924
From Mr. Gray, I take it?

16:43.894 --> 16:45.727
What a strange
sort of man he is.

16:45.763 --> 16:47.229
Isn't he though?

16:47.264 --> 16:48.897
He's awfully charming...

16:49.817 --> 16:52.901
but I think a little
too sophisticated for me.

16:52.936 --> 16:54.069
Lily.

16:54.938 --> 16:58.190
We should think about
getting away.

16:58.242 --> 17:01.359
- Away where?
- I don't know.

17:02.613 --> 17:04.112
Leave London.

17:05.332 --> 17:07.616
- Take a bit of a holiday.
- Nonsense.

17:08.752 --> 17:09.951
I'm just getting
used to the place,

17:10.002 --> 17:12.454
and you have so much more
to teach me, don't you?

17:17.845 --> 17:20.962
I'm safe... here with you.

17:21.598 --> 17:23.265
This is our home.

17:26.637 --> 17:27.803
Now...

17:29.356 --> 17:32.357
if I know my boy, he hasn't
thought about breakfast.

17:33.811 --> 17:34.860
[exhales sharply]

17:34.895 --> 17:36.895
I'll make your favorite
poached eggs.

17:38.949 --> 17:40.565
'Cause you're so good.

17:42.152 --> 17:43.118
[chuckles]

17:50.544 --> 17:52.994
Wait.
Don't bother about breakfast.

17:54.665 --> 17:55.714
I'm going out.

17:57.167 --> 17:58.466
[Lily] All right.

17:59.136 --> 18:01.469
Can you bring back
some butter and eggs?

18:01.505 --> 18:03.138
We're running low.

18:07.144 --> 18:08.176
Yes.

18:17.855 --> 18:20.188
<i>It was the veins in my arms
that told me.</i>

18:21.525 --> 18:23.942
When they collapse,
you have to find fresh ones.

18:24.695 --> 18:26.561
I'm running short.

18:27.581 --> 18:29.414
So I'm addicted.

18:29.449 --> 18:31.283
Which is no great terror
to me...

18:32.703 --> 18:34.586
but the cause...

18:36.123 --> 18:37.289
Pain.

18:39.293 --> 18:44.045
I don't have the proper tools
to perform this operation.

18:44.047 --> 18:45.680
I don't know what
I'm doing...

18:46.416 --> 18:47.682
honestly.

18:48.952 --> 18:51.286
Oh, we're all neophytes
in love, Victor.

18:52.089 --> 18:53.388
None of us have the tools,

18:53.423 --> 18:55.757
or the weapons,
or the resources.

18:55.792 --> 18:59.594
Prepared as we think we are,
we're defeated.

18:59.630 --> 19:03.315
[scoffs]
I have surmounted in my life.

19:05.202 --> 19:08.286
It's been my inexorable
pattern of behavior.

19:09.406 --> 19:11.139
No mystery too deep...

19:11.808 --> 19:13.408
no puzzle too complex.

19:16.046 --> 19:18.046
They've fallen before me.

19:21.168 --> 19:23.752
I don't know what wisdom
I can offer.

19:25.839 --> 19:28.890
We're in the same
unknown jungle, my friend.

19:28.926 --> 19:31.426
We have to thrash
our way out alone.

19:31.478 --> 19:33.428
Isn't that what love is?

19:34.398 --> 19:36.898
And if we're in danger of
losing that love, and that...

19:37.851 --> 19:40.936
creates greater panic still,
what do we do then?

19:42.439 --> 19:44.339
We suffer in our own ways.

19:45.876 --> 19:48.443
But we're all unequal
to the task.

19:49.546 --> 19:50.779
We are...

19:52.883 --> 19:54.215
enchanted.

19:59.506 --> 20:00.789
All my life, I've been a man

20:00.841 --> 20:02.791
who sought
singular achievement

20:02.843 --> 20:05.427
and fed on rage
and dissatisfaction.

20:07.047 --> 20:09.881
My character was one of
monomaniacal anger.

20:11.268 --> 20:13.518
My blood thrilled to the lash.

20:16.139 --> 20:19.140
I was cruel to my wife,
and to my children,

20:19.142 --> 20:21.860
and grew more famous
in the process...

20:23.230 --> 20:24.312
more myself.

20:26.483 --> 20:27.532
And now?

20:27.567 --> 20:29.317
I've become alienated
from the cruel man

20:29.369 --> 20:31.703
who used to look back at me
in the mirror.

20:36.827 --> 20:38.493
What is this face, Doctor?

20:40.247 --> 20:43.164
Is it the one you knew,
and properly feared?

20:44.634 --> 20:47.168
I've... seen you grow content.

20:47.170 --> 20:49.504
You've seen me grow
into a happy man.

20:50.841 --> 20:52.257
But look deeper.

20:54.311 --> 20:55.810
That's not who I am.

20:57.814 --> 21:00.648
This thing divorces us
from our wits and our dignity.

21:02.753 --> 21:04.686
Our purest instincts
are undone.

21:07.441 --> 21:09.858
We become strangers
to ourselves.

21:13.030 --> 21:14.362
[sighs]

21:15.115 --> 21:16.698
But it can't go on forever.

21:17.534 --> 21:19.451
Finally, we must look
in the mirror.

21:23.040 --> 21:25.457
On the day
of my wife's funeral...

21:27.344 --> 21:29.260
I was dancing at a ball.

21:31.515 --> 21:33.465
Who is that man, Doctor?

21:44.561 --> 21:46.277
[chanting in demonic language]

22:00.043 --> 22:01.743
[chanting continues]

22:02.746 --> 22:04.462
[heart pounding]

22:07.834 --> 22:09.084
[exhales deeply]

22:11.805 --> 22:14.422
So, it seems
our narrative is complete.

22:14.474 --> 22:16.091
What we speak of now,
we whisper.

22:16.143 --> 22:18.259
It cannot leave this room.

22:24.234 --> 22:25.200
Very well.

22:26.319 --> 22:28.486
I shall conclude the tale,
with emendations to follow.

22:28.572 --> 22:30.989
This is what
you've heard so far.

22:31.024 --> 22:32.824
"In the great war for
the Heavenly Throne,

22:32.859 --> 22:33.942
we were vanquished,

22:33.944 --> 22:36.861
so God looked down
on His defeated angels

22:36.913 --> 22:38.246
and found us to be
evil angels,

22:38.281 --> 22:40.532
so He cast us out.

22:40.584 --> 22:43.852
He took us by our winged backs
and raised us over His head.

22:43.887 --> 22:46.387
Thence did He fling us
from His Heavenly Throne

22:46.423 --> 22:50.458
and cast us down, to Earth
and to Hell. So we were..."

22:56.550 --> 22:58.766
And now the rest of the tale.

23:00.137 --> 23:01.803
"So we were cleaved apart...

23:02.973 --> 23:07.308
two brothers cast out
to two realms.

23:07.360 --> 23:10.645
One brother to Earth
and the other brother to Hell.

23:10.680 --> 23:13.148
And thus were we set
in eternal enmity.

23:13.200 --> 23:15.400
My brother on Earth,

23:15.452 --> 23:17.869
to feed on the blood
of the living by night.

23:17.904 --> 23:20.989
And myself in Hell to feed
on the souls of the dead.

23:21.024 --> 23:24.492
Both in an eternal quest
for the Mother of Evil

23:24.528 --> 23:27.128
who will release us
from our bondage

23:27.164 --> 23:29.998
and allow one of us
to reconquer Heaven

23:30.000 --> 23:33.218
and topple God
from his bloody throne.

23:33.253 --> 23:37.555
And so will the Darkness
reign, on Earth, in Heaven...

23:39.609 --> 23:41.042
everlasting."

23:43.413 --> 23:44.929
And so comes the Apocalypse.

23:54.608 --> 23:55.940
Two brothers?

23:56.693 --> 23:58.943
Apparently,
Lucifer isn't an only child.

23:58.995 --> 24:00.778
And like many brothers,
they don't get along.

24:00.830 --> 24:02.330
One brother cast to Earth.

24:03.250 --> 24:05.333
Is that the vampire Master
that captured Mina?

24:05.368 --> 24:08.369
And all those he creates
in his image.

24:08.371 --> 24:10.955
He tried to lure Vanessa
through Mina.

24:12.092 --> 24:14.292
- While the other brother...
- Lucifer, banished to Hell.

24:14.344 --> 24:17.512
Tried to possess her soul...
and failed.

24:17.547 --> 24:20.014
So now he makes use of
the witches to do his bidding.

24:20.050 --> 24:21.382
[Sembene] Why her?

24:22.219 --> 24:23.785
Why Miss Vanessa?

24:24.554 --> 24:26.554
There are old prophesies
from prehistory

24:26.606 --> 24:29.390
that tell of such
chosen ministers of evil.

24:30.694 --> 24:32.060
<i>Amunet from the Egyptians,</i>

24:32.112 --> 24:34.312
<i>Lilith from the Talmud,
the Nordic Hella,</i>

24:34.364 --> 24:35.563
- <i>the Celtic Macha.</i>
- [Madame Kali chanting spell]

24:35.599 --> 24:36.731
[Lyle] Mara from the Hindus.

24:36.783 --> 24:39.951
All variations of deities
or demigods who were destined

24:39.986 --> 24:42.237
to unleash annihilation
on the world.

24:42.289 --> 24:43.571
And all women.

24:43.623 --> 24:46.407
Something thought unholy
in the erotic power

24:46.459 --> 24:49.127
- they held over men.
- [Madame Kali moaning]

24:49.162 --> 24:51.179
[Madame Kali
continues chanting]

24:58.505 --> 24:59.554
[gasping]

24:59.589 --> 25:03.057
And to face this
titanic threat to Miss Ives,

25:03.093 --> 25:05.093
we four and Mr. Chandler.

25:05.095 --> 25:08.096
And... perhaps another.

25:08.098 --> 25:10.431
[Madame Kali
continues chanting]

25:11.434 --> 25:14.185
The mystery guest
at the party.

25:14.237 --> 25:17.021
Only referred to here
obliquely as...

25:17.073 --> 25:18.356
the Hound of God.

25:18.408 --> 25:22.110
- Hound of God?
- Yes, or something very like.

25:22.162 --> 25:25.246
I think this figure is
a threat to the Demon's plans.

25:26.082 --> 25:27.649
Now the specific taxonomy

25:27.684 --> 25:28.750
- is rather...
- Hmm.

25:30.120 --> 25:31.786
In the Arabic,
it's not "hound"...

25:33.957 --> 25:35.039
It's "wolf."

25:35.091 --> 25:36.958
[speaking demonic language]

25:36.993 --> 25:38.343

Hello, Father.

- You're looking very smart.
- I try my best.

Are you going
to favor us with a dance?

27:31.157 --> 27:32.290
I just might.

27:32.325 --> 27:35.293
Come on, Mina, let's show

29:45.475 --> 29:48.175
He released himself
from the enchantment.

29:52.215 --> 29:54.265
You lost your power over him?

29:54.934 --> 29:56.017
Perhaps you're
not as desirable

29:56.052 --> 29:58.019
as you thought, Mother.

29:58.771 --> 30:00.221
Should I try?

30:03.309 --> 30:04.692
You think you have that skill?

30:04.727 --> 30:06.644
We have to do something.

Such a baby.

30:13.820 --> 30:15.570
We need do nothing.

30:19.125 --> 30:22.994
A man's character
is always his destiny.

30:24.330 --> 30:27.164
And now
Sir Malcolm is himself again.

30:27.216 --> 30:29.717
He is full of anger...

30:30.920 --> 30:32.753
and will strike back.

30:35.224 --> 30:36.824
And so he will come...

- And then?

30:43.099 --> 30:45.182

Careful, child.

34:48.594 --> 34:49.944
[Sembene] Sir Malcolm?

34:57.320 --> 34:59.103
Sir Malcolm has gone.

35:00.022 --> 35:02.189
We need to find Miss Ives
and Mr. Chandler.

35:47.236 --> 35:48.285
[Madame Kali laughing]

35:56.245 --> 35:57.578
[screaming]

35:59.215 --> 36:00.314
[Madame Kali laughing]

36:00.349 --> 36:01.665
[growling]

36:25.024 --> 36:26.023
So...

36:28.411 --> 36:30.494
you've discovered my secret.

36:34.016 --> 36:35.783
Forever unchanging.

36:37.954 --> 36:40.254
My sins made manifest
only here.

36:43.676 --> 36:46.293
At times, I've deceived myself
into thinking, uh...

36:47.797 --> 36:49.263
I'm other than this.

36:52.468 --> 36:53.884
Don't we all want to
paint ourselves

36:53.936 --> 36:55.803
into something...

36:55.805 --> 36:57.438
better than we are?

36:59.859 --> 37:01.225
But that...

37:04.313 --> 37:06.480
is who I truly am, Angelique.

37:13.155 --> 37:15.205
Can you accept me as I am?

37:19.662 --> 37:21.128
Can you love me?

37:23.799 --> 37:24.832
Yes.

37:39.598 --> 37:40.814
[gulps]

37:47.523 --> 37:48.689
[gasps]

37:55.531 --> 37:56.830
[choking]

38:01.137 --> 38:03.003
I don't think you can.

39:04.834 --> 39:06.300
[Lily] Mmm.

39:14.110 --> 39:16.193
- [floorboards creaking]
- [Lily gasps]

39:17.830 --> 39:19.947
Mr. Clare, you startled me.

39:25.254 --> 39:27.121
I don't... I don't think
it's entirely proper

39:27.123 --> 39:29.373
that you should be here
without Victor.

39:30.259 --> 39:32.459
Perhaps you should
come back another time.

39:35.848 --> 39:37.381
Why are you so quiet?

39:38.801 --> 39:41.135
You're never usually
at a loss for words.

39:41.554 --> 39:44.354
Aren't there some verses
you could recite?

39:47.026 --> 39:48.892
Stop pretending
you're frightened.

39:49.812 --> 39:50.944
[voice shuddering]
Please leave.

39:53.149 --> 39:54.565
Who are you?

39:55.034 --> 39:57.201
What... What do you mean?

39:57.953 --> 39:59.903
Who are you?

39:59.955 --> 40:01.488
Honestly, I think
you're more able

40:01.490 --> 40:03.991
to answer
that question than I.

40:03.993 --> 40:06.827
My past is unknown to me,
as well you know.

40:06.879 --> 40:07.995
Is it?

40:09.798 --> 40:11.465
[Lily]
What are you talking about?

40:13.502 --> 40:15.586
[Mr. Clare]
Did you enjoy your evening?

40:16.055 --> 40:17.137
What?

40:17.923 --> 40:19.306
With that young man.

40:20.226 --> 40:21.842
Were you spying on me?

40:21.844 --> 40:23.594
Did you enjoy your evening?

40:23.679 --> 40:26.930
Yes, I did. Now, please leave.

40:26.982 --> 40:28.849
This behavior is
really insupportable!

40:28.901 --> 40:31.018
- When Victor hears of this...
- There is no Victor!

40:31.053 --> 40:32.603
- [Lily gasps]
- There is no young man!

40:32.655 --> 40:34.988
- There is thee and me!
- All right! Very well!

40:35.024 --> 40:37.524
What in God's name
do you want of me?

40:37.576 --> 40:40.827
What I want I cannot have.
You're incapable of it.

40:40.863 --> 40:42.913
Yes, I know.

40:45.668 --> 40:48.068
You want to walk
in the village

40:48.103 --> 40:50.337
and hold my hand.

40:50.372 --> 40:51.605
And when people are cruel,

40:51.640 --> 40:54.041
you want me to love you
even more.

40:55.911 --> 40:57.144
Do I hurt you?

40:58.280 --> 40:59.413
[Lily scoffs]

40:59.815 --> 41:01.682
You pathetic creature.

41:02.818 --> 41:06.153
How can you imagine
that I could care for you?

41:07.223 --> 41:10.774
Does that face
belong alongside this?

41:12.978 --> 41:15.229
Doesn't the world smile on us?

41:16.198 --> 41:18.315
Don't we make
a beautiful couple,

41:18.367 --> 41:19.783
"thee and me"?

41:19.818 --> 41:22.152
Shall we wander the pastures
and recite

41:22.204 --> 41:24.738
your fucking poetry
to the fucking cows?

41:24.790 --> 41:26.573
You are blind...

41:27.543 --> 41:29.243
like all other men.

41:29.295 --> 41:30.911
And you are unlike
all other women.

41:31.630 --> 41:33.080
[both grunt]

41:34.633 --> 41:36.049
You tell me how.

41:38.921 --> 41:41.722
We flatter our men
with our pain.

41:42.675 --> 41:44.758
We bow before them.

41:44.760 --> 41:48.312
We make ourselves dolls
for their amusement.

41:48.347 --> 41:52.182
We lose our dignity in corsets
and high shoes

41:52.234 --> 41:54.818
and gossip
and the slavery of marriage!

41:54.853 --> 41:56.436
And our reward
for this service?

41:57.690 --> 41:59.072
[voice breaking]
The back of the hand...

42:01.076 --> 42:03.694
the face
turned to the pillow...

42:03.746 --> 42:05.946
the bloody, aching cunt

42:05.998 --> 42:08.081
as you force us onto your beds

42:08.117 --> 42:09.783
to take your
fat, heaving bodies!

42:09.818 --> 42:11.251
[crying]

42:11.287 --> 42:13.503
You drag us into the alleys,
my lad,

42:13.539 --> 42:16.173
and cram yourselves
into our mouths for two bob

42:16.759 --> 42:19.126
when you're
not beating us senseless!

42:19.178 --> 42:21.428
When we're not bloody
from the eyes,

42:21.463 --> 42:23.797
and the mouth, and the ass
and the cunt!

42:23.849 --> 42:24.798
[Mr. Clare grunting]

42:26.018 --> 42:27.517
[both panting]

42:33.442 --> 42:34.641
Never again...

42:37.363 --> 42:40.981
will I kneel to any man.

42:44.236 --> 42:46.370
Now they shall kneel to me.

42:49.074 --> 42:50.791
As you do, monster.

42:50.826 --> 42:52.159
[trembling]

42:56.332 --> 42:57.831
My monster.

43:00.419 --> 43:02.636
My beautiful corpse.

43:08.227 --> 43:11.178
How clever he's been,
our creator.

43:14.149 --> 43:15.565
But our little god...

43:16.602 --> 43:18.852
has brought forth
not angels...

43:20.406 --> 43:21.738
but demons.

43:23.025 --> 43:24.825
Thee and me.

43:28.530 --> 43:31.531
And what should we do
with this power, undead thing?

43:33.285 --> 43:35.869
You're a thoughtful man,
a philosopher even.

43:35.921 --> 43:39.172
So tell me, why do we exist?

43:41.260 --> 43:43.710
Why have we been chosen?
Tell me.

43:46.932 --> 43:48.048
I don't know.

43:50.302 --> 43:51.885
Is it to suffer?

43:54.723 --> 43:55.722
Yes.

44:00.062 --> 44:01.278
Must it be?

44:02.598 --> 44:04.131
How can it be other?

44:05.934 --> 44:07.567
We long
for that we cannot have.

44:08.103 --> 44:09.236
Women?

44:10.105 --> 44:12.406
I'll bring you a dozen.
We'll fuck 'em together.

44:16.145 --> 44:17.210
Me?

44:21.417 --> 44:23.300
Then you shall have me.

44:26.171 --> 44:27.587
I want you.

44:29.057 --> 44:30.323
[Mr. Clare shuddering]

44:31.760 --> 44:36.062
I want a man
unlike all other men.

44:36.648 --> 44:37.681
My brother,

44:38.767 --> 44:40.233
my equal.

44:42.020 --> 44:43.236
I'll take you...

44:45.107 --> 44:46.606
by this beautiful,

44:47.276 --> 44:52.028
white, dead hand and lead you
to my bed right now.

44:52.614 --> 44:54.581
I'll bleed for you.

44:55.784 --> 44:57.284
I'll love you...

44:58.954 --> 45:00.504
for your sadness...

45:01.790 --> 45:04.124
and your poetry
and your passion

45:04.176 --> 45:05.425
and your rage

45:05.928 --> 45:10.046
and your infinite,
luxurious ugliness.

45:11.216 --> 45:13.216
I'll lick your sins away.

45:16.221 --> 45:17.637
[Mr. Clare panting]

45:21.376 --> 45:23.443
And when Victor comes home...

45:26.865 --> 45:30.150
we'll put our hands
around his throat together...

45:31.870 --> 45:33.570
and watch him die.

45:35.874 --> 45:38.124
And then this will be
our home.

45:40.045 --> 45:41.328
And then?

45:43.215 --> 45:45.165
What then, undead thing?

45:49.171 --> 45:52.589
We were created to rule,
my love.

45:54.176 --> 45:58.512
And the blood of mankind
will water our garden.

46:00.015 --> 46:02.232
Us and our kin...

46:03.151 --> 46:04.518
and our children,

46:04.570 --> 46:06.436
and our generations.

46:07.656 --> 46:09.439
We are the conquerors.

46:10.859 --> 46:13.410
We are the pure blood.

46:13.445 --> 46:17.197
We are steel and sinew both.

46:17.199 --> 46:19.699
We are the next 1000 years.

46:20.419 --> 46:22.168
We are the dead.

46:32.881 --> 46:34.014
[panting]

46:36.885 --> 46:38.184
No being...

46:40.355 --> 46:43.607
who ever was...
or ever will be,

46:43.642 --> 46:45.225
shall love you...

46:46.395 --> 46:47.694
like I do.

47:08.083 --> 47:09.249
[Madame Kali] <i>Memory.</i>

47:11.553 --> 47:14.170
It is such a potent force
in our lives.

47:15.223 --> 47:17.090
All of these <i>memento mori...</i>

47:18.477 --> 47:20.260
for one sobering message...

47:21.530 --> 47:23.730
"Remember that you will die."

47:25.734 --> 47:28.168
- What do you want of me?
- You see, darling,

47:29.371 --> 47:31.771
I understand hunting as well.

47:31.807 --> 47:34.174
Though I've never been
to your beloved Africa.

47:35.310 --> 47:39.112
Sometimes you tie a lamb
to lure a lion, don't you?

47:40.315 --> 47:42.716
So all I require of you
is that you...

47:43.752 --> 47:45.118
[mimics sheep bleating]

47:47.556 --> 47:48.755
Why Miss Ives?

47:48.790 --> 47:50.090
Because the Master
desires her.

47:50.892 --> 47:52.125
It's not personal...

47:53.028 --> 47:54.494
it's goods and services.

47:55.297 --> 47:56.796
I supply him
with what he wants,

47:56.832 --> 47:59.132
he supplies me
with what I want.

47:59.167 --> 48:00.367
It's tit for tat, Sir M.

48:00.402 --> 48:02.102
And what does he give you?

48:03.205 --> 48:04.404
No, Malcolm...

48:06.141 --> 48:07.207
us.

48:08.477 --> 48:10.677
Eternal life, eternal beauty.

48:11.446 --> 48:13.380
Such shallow pursuits.

48:13.982 --> 48:17.050
What value do they hold
if we walk always alone?

48:20.222 --> 48:22.122
I've been too much alone...

48:23.392 --> 48:27.460
and this house is... so cold.

48:28.830 --> 48:32.032
But with you,
I've found a kind of elation.

48:33.168 --> 48:36.036
To feel
the old touch of passion.

48:36.071 --> 48:37.554
To yearn.

48:40.058 --> 48:41.474
To be truly human.

48:41.510 --> 48:44.644
My humanity, such as it is,
is colder than this house.

48:44.680 --> 48:45.745
No.

48:47.149 --> 48:49.115
No arrogance or pride.

48:50.318 --> 48:53.319
This is your chance
to live, Malcolm.

48:54.523 --> 48:56.122
Let's bury the past together.

48:57.059 --> 49:00.060
Your wife... your son,

49:00.095 --> 49:02.862
your daughter,
and all my sins as well,

49:03.432 --> 49:05.165
which surely match your own.

49:05.200 --> 49:06.416
Far exceed them.

49:06.501 --> 49:08.835
[sobbing]
I don't want to live alone.

49:08.870 --> 49:10.036
Nor do you.

49:10.038 --> 49:12.756
Take my hand and love me.

49:12.791 --> 49:14.841
We have no one else.

49:14.876 --> 49:17.210
And together
we will walk quietly.

49:19.965 --> 49:21.131
[sniffling]

49:22.050 --> 49:24.300
So quietly.

49:25.387 --> 49:26.686
You know, if I could,

49:27.222 --> 49:29.773
I would tear
that beautiful head

49:29.808 --> 49:34.527
from your shoulders
and laugh all the while.

49:38.233 --> 49:40.400
But if you will let
Miss Ives live,

49:43.622 --> 49:45.955
I will walk with you
to the end of time.

49:46.625 --> 49:48.291
She means so much?

49:49.494 --> 49:51.044
She means all.

49:54.883 --> 49:56.716
It's the one thing
I cannot do.

49:57.753 --> 49:59.969
The Master will have her.

50:00.005 --> 50:03.089
Then when I have played
this game out, my dear...

50:04.593 --> 50:06.843
the lamb will kill the lion.

50:10.732 --> 50:12.198
I suppose
I shouldn't be surprised

50:12.234 --> 50:14.834
at your tiresome obsession
with Miss Ives.

50:14.870 --> 50:16.970
You're so very close
after all.

50:18.974 --> 50:21.040
You knew her
when she was born, didn't you?

50:21.076 --> 50:22.842
- Yes.
- You saw her grow

50:22.878 --> 50:24.878
into the fine young woman
she is?

50:25.313 --> 50:26.346
Yes.

50:27.649 --> 50:31.417
Yeah. You watched her
rather carefully, I'd say.

50:31.453 --> 50:32.452
Did I?

50:36.591 --> 50:38.258
Of course you did.

50:41.563 --> 50:43.363
She was always your favorite.

50:48.770 --> 50:50.637
It's good we care
for our daughters.

51:00.899 --> 51:02.699
Mind her, she stings.

51:03.819 --> 51:05.902
I'll leave you two
to catch up.

51:05.954 --> 51:07.070
One other thing.

51:07.656 --> 51:10.824
Our theme for tonight, yes?

51:13.662 --> 51:16.079
I'll leave you
with a few memories.

51:18.166 --> 51:19.465
Mind them.

51:20.719 --> 51:22.252
They sting too.
