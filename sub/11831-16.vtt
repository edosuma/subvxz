can't cross-examine.

studies on those power lines
in Fairfield.

14:20.482 --> 14:23.416
The studies were dismissed,
as was I.

14:23.482 --> 14:25.882
They had to dismiss those
studies.

14:25.949 --> 14:29.449
Otherwise they would have been
lookin' at a thousand lawsuits,
a zillion dollars in damages.

14:29.516 --> 14:32.516
I wouldn't ask, but--
Mr. Berluti.

14:34.182 --> 14:37.816
I spent four months at McLean
after a nervous breakdown.

14:37.882 --> 14:41.949
<i>By 5:30 sharp,</i>
<i>I am drinking.</i>

14:42.016 --> 14:46.449
Now why the hell would
you want to rely on me?

14:46.516 --> 14:48.516
'Cause I'm desperate.

14:48.582 --> 14:51.316
And I got twelve
clients with cancer,
more desperate than me.

14:51.382 --> 14:54.282
And you actually think
that I can change that?

14:54.349 --> 14:56.782
What's to lose?
<i>What's to lose?</i>

14:56.849 --> 14:58.816
I'll tell you.

14:58.882 --> 15:02.549
Even though I'm still drinkin',
I'm functional again.
I got a day job.

15:02.616 --> 15:05.382
<i>I put on clean underwear</i>
<i>every day.</i>

15:05.449 --> 15:10.449
I even got a lady who's either
crazy about me or just crazy.

15:10.516 --> 15:14.716
I go up on that stand,
we both know the score.
They're gonna tear me down.

15:14.782 --> 15:18.416
<i>They're not gonna spare</i>
<i>any expense.</i>
<i>They're gonna rip me apart.</i>

15:18.482 --> 15:21.049
And it's gonna
be in the papers
for everybody to see.

15:21.116 --> 15:24.816
My lady will read it,
my ex will read it
as she fights visitation.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.749
My kid will read it.

15:26.816 --> 15:30.349
<i>Now, I got a pretty good</i>
<i>status quo goin' here.</i>

15:30.416 --> 15:34.182
<i>That</i> is what
I got to lose.

15:34.249 --> 15:36.016
Now,

15:36.082 --> 15:39.682
tell me my throwin'
that away is gonna count
for somethin' in the end.

15:44.649 --> 15:46.782
We could send some officers
to warn the guy.

15:46.849 --> 15:49.616
But he hasn't said
anything we could actually
arrest him for.

15:49.682 --> 15:53.549
You see his rap sheet, Helen?
Look, I'd love to take this
dirtbag off the street.

15:53.616 --> 15:57.616
We lost him two years ago
on a homicide because
the confession was coerced.

15:57.682 --> 16:00.916
I mean, we knew he shot
a policeman, we just couldn't
prove it, even though--

16:00.982 --> 16:02.249
Exactly.
The guy's a killer.

16:02.316 --> 16:04.549
Now he has made a deadly threat.

16:04.616 --> 16:07.582
I don't care how well he's
disguised it, we gotta do
something to protect her.

16:07.649 --> 16:11.149
If she wants a police escort,
I could arrange it
for a few days.

16:11.216 --> 16:15.582
- But beyond that--
- Okay, what if Rebecca doesn't
testify at the P.C. hearing?

16:15.649 --> 16:20.149
Not good. They haven't found
the weapon yet, he didn't
test positive for residue.

16:20.216 --> 16:23.416
Because he had gloves.
Which also haven't been found.

16:23.482 --> 16:26.382
The whole case right now
is Rebecca.

16:26.449 --> 16:31.249
If she doesn't testify,
from what I hear, we may
not make probable cause.

16:34.749 --> 16:37.916
Where is she?
They're comin' in.
The elevator. Yeah, right.

16:37.982 --> 16:40.882
Judicial economy
was the main argument.
There was no transcript.

16:40.949 --> 16:44.116
It was all about time--
Saving time.
<i>[ Bailiff ] All rise.</i>

16:45.549 --> 16:47.549
Yes. And don't forget,
there wasn't any notice.

16:47.616 --> 16:49.782
He just sprang it.

16:49.849 --> 16:52.282
All right.
Maybe you should do it.

16:52.349 --> 16:55.916
Unfortunately, my reputation
isn't too much better than yours
with two of these judges.

16:55.982 --> 16:59.016
- We're better off with Lindsay.
I'll fill in the gaps.
- <i>[ Bailiff ] Be seated.</i>

16:59.082 --> 17:03.516
Okay. The issue,
hot off the press, it seems,
is the splitting of the trial.

17:03.582 --> 17:07.781
Yes. Your Honors,
we feel, as indeed did
Judge Walsh,

17:07.848 --> 17:10.882
that an enormous amount
of court time would
be spent on damages,

17:10.949 --> 17:13.049
considering there
are multiple plaintiffs.

17:13.116 --> 17:16.116
So, why not answer
the liability question first?

17:16.182 --> 17:20.316
That's a nice premise, but
it's all based on the assumption
that we lose on liability.

17:20.382 --> 17:23.915
If we win, you'll end up
spending more time. You'd ask
the jury to deliberate twice,

17:23.982 --> 17:27.415
you'd also probably
be duplicating some
of the testimony.

17:27.482 --> 17:29.716
That goes against judicial
economy.

17:29.782 --> 17:32.916
If and only if you prevail on
liability, which given the
evidence seems highly unlikely--

17:32.982 --> 17:35.282
The reason they want the trial
split is simple.

17:35.349 --> 17:37.349
We had a deposition
this morning.

17:37.416 --> 17:40.749
One of our plaintiffs talked
about his son having leukemia.

17:40.816 --> 17:42.949
It was emotional.
It was powerful.

17:43.016 --> 17:45.982
And when it was over, Mr. West
said to himself,

17:46.049 --> 17:48.916
"We cannot let that witness
ever take the stand.

17:48.982 --> 17:51.649
We cannot let a jury hear
what we just heard."

17:51.716 --> 17:54.949
So how does he
accomplish that?
By splitting the trial in two.

17:55.016 --> 17:56.816
<i>And I must say</i>
<i>it seems to make sense.</i>

17:56.882 --> 18:00.549
Liability should be decided
on fact, counsel, not emotion.

18:00.616 --> 18:03.082
[ Lindsay ]
And we trust a jury to
distinguish between the two.

18:03.149 --> 18:06.049
The whole essence of a
jury trial, Your Honor, is--
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!

18:06.116 --> 18:08.649
Now here comes her
Constitutional repertoire,
you see?

18:08.716 --> 18:12.082
Did you bring your flag today?
Since you raise it,
what about notice?

18:12.149 --> 18:14.382
He didn't file any motion
to split this trial.

18:14.449 --> 18:17.416
He suddenly raised it
as a suggestion,
and the court granted it.

18:17.482 --> 18:20.482
<i>If we're really interested</i>
<i>in saving time, please.</i>

18:20.549 --> 18:23.282
That ruling almost guarantees
us an appeal.

18:23.349 --> 18:26.749
Now it's you assuming
your own defeat.

18:26.816 --> 18:31.416
Win or lose, my clients should
get their day in court. Trial
splitting is to prevent that.

18:31.482 --> 18:34.582
They're trying to keep
our clients out
of the witness chair.

18:34.649 --> 18:38.649
But your clients will get
to testify if you satisfy
causation, counsel.

18:38.716 --> 18:42.282
The science part of this case
is gonna be dry and
God-awful boring.

18:42.349 --> 18:45.349
Stodgy excruciating expert
testimony.

18:45.416 --> 18:50.616
By splitting the trial into two
sections, you're giving the jury
the option of getting out early.

18:50.682 --> 18:56.116
All they'll have to do is
just say, "No," on liability
and they get to go home.

18:56.182 --> 19:00.582
My clients will not get a fair
trial by splitting this trial.

19:00.649 --> 19:03.849
Your clients have no case.

19:03.916 --> 19:07.382
All right. We've heard
the arguments. We'll let you
know end of business.

with the witness?
I don't know.

"Well, we thought it would

I can't speak
for Eleanor, but...

40:22.173 --> 40:25.673
I think she'll come along, too.

40:37.840 --> 40:40.940
Come on, Bec.
I'll walk you out.
I still have stuff to do.

Nice.
What can I do for you?

41:30.506 --> 41:33.540
Probably about as much
as I can do for you.

41:33.606 --> 41:37.040
- He's sauced.
- Hmm? Does that mean drunk?
I certainly am.

I don't know, Lindsay.
I mean if he's really serious
about trying this case.

41:58.173 --> 42:02.140
You should be the one to do it.
