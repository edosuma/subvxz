[Joe]
<i>Previously on</i> Jonas...

00:02.375 --> 00:03.917
<i>This summer in LA is gonna be epic.</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:05.583
Stella's gonna date Joe from Jonas.

00:05.667 --> 00:07.959
When I see her tonight,
I'm gonna say it loud and clear,

00:08.041 --> 00:11.000
"Stella Malone,
will you be my girlfriend?"

00:11.083 --> 00:13.166
Vanessa Page.
Your show rocks.

00:13.250 --> 00:16.208
Joe is in a cell-free environment.
Please try him back.

00:16.291 --> 00:18.041
Some girl answered his phone.

00:18.125 --> 00:20.208
-I want to be friends.
-We are friends.

00:20.291 --> 00:22.166
Just friends.

00:22.250 --> 00:25.125
-It's really good to see you.
-It's good to see you, too.

00:42.750 --> 00:44.792
[Joe screaming]

00:53.291 --> 00:54.583
[screams]

00:54.709 --> 00:56.208
What are you doing?

00:56.291 --> 00:58.041
Saving Joe.
What are you doing?

00:58.125 --> 01:01.041
Nick, Vanessa said there might be
a part for me in her movie.

01:01.125 --> 01:02.291
We're working out my acting chops.

01:02.375 --> 01:04.834
OK, that explains nothing.
And you?

01:04.917 --> 01:06.500
You know, I've always
wanted to be a director.

01:06.583 --> 01:09.291
-Always?
-At least for the last couple of weeks.

01:09.375 --> 01:14.500
Well, I've always wanted to go to sleep,
so please keep it down, OK?

01:15.709 --> 01:17.208
-[screams]
-Joseph!

01:17.291 --> 01:18.917
Sorry, I bit my tongue.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.750
-All right, let's do it again.
-OK, down.

01:22.625 --> 01:24.583

Hey, Mace.

02:25.625 --> 02:28.250
Hey! Oh, I was just
updating the Jonas site.

02:28.333 --> 02:29.750
Anything you want me to post?

02:29.834 --> 02:31.834
Post this:
"Macy's offline."

02:31.917 --> 02:33.917
-You're supposed to be on vacation.
-OK.

02:36.959 --> 02:39.875
-Oh, um...
-Sorry.

02:40.834 --> 02:42.083
I got it.

02:42.500 --> 02:45.500
[exhales]
Um, so, this pool's cool and all,

02:45.583 --> 02:48.417
but I'm kind of thinking beach.
It's so close, you know.

02:48.500 --> 02:51.041
Yeah, I can almost smell it.

02:51.375 --> 02:53.000
That's my body spray.

02:53.083 --> 02:54.667
Hey, DZ, you ever hear of knocking?

02:54.750 --> 02:57.625
Yeah, how about,
"Knock-knock, I smell good"? [chuckles]

02:57.709 --> 02:59.458
It's Beach by Stone Stevens.

02:59.542 --> 03:01.125
And I'm rocking his man-jewelry.

03:01.208 --> 03:04.083
Wait, Stone Stevens, the pro surfer?

03:04.166 --> 03:06.959
Yeah, he's a close,
personal homie of mine.

03:09.208 --> 03:10.250
You want to meet him?

03:10.333 --> 03:13.417
Yeah, sounds like a rad adventure.

03:14.333 --> 03:16.667
I just said "rad," so Cali.

03:18.166 --> 03:19.625
Well, if she's in, I'm in.
Take us.

03:19.709 --> 03:23.458
Well, I would love to,
but I don't have a car.

03:23.542 --> 03:26.792
-So, you can't take us?
-Well, my Moms can.

03:26.875 --> 03:28.625
OK, great, so let's go.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.458
But she's at Pilates for an hour,

03:30.542 --> 03:32.625
so until then we're straight
chillin' poolside.

03:32.709 --> 03:34.000
Ah...

03:36.583 --> 03:38.583
-I'm calling a cab.
-Sounds good.

03:38.667 --> 03:39.917
See ya.

03:40.375 --> 03:43.125
-Hey.
-Hi.

03:45.792 --> 03:47.125
OK, so this is an expression drill.

03:47.333 --> 03:50.208
The first one is gonna be happy.
Action!

03:52.333 --> 03:54.125
OK. Sad.

03:58.375 --> 03:59.709
Scared.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.583
OK, enamored.

04:05.083 --> 04:06.083
What's that?

04:06.166 --> 04:09.834
You know, like when you like somebody,
you have feelings for them. Action!

04:12.125 --> 04:13.959
Dude, I'm not giving you my love face.

04:14.041 --> 04:16.792
It's not for me.
You know, just picture me as a girl.

04:16.875 --> 04:19.667
You know, and you're trying
to impress me. Action!

04:22.542 --> 04:24.667
All I can think about is Stella.

04:25.208 --> 04:26.250
Still?

04:27.583 --> 04:29.291
[doorbell rings]

04:29.375 --> 04:30.625
Be right back.

04:30.834 --> 04:31.792
Hurry.

04:35.041 --> 04:37.000
Vanessa, hey.

04:37.166 --> 04:39.709
-Are you ready?
-Always. For what?

04:40.625 --> 04:42.291
Well, I talked to my director

04:42.375 --> 04:44.625
about who should play my love interest
in <i>Forever April,</i>

04:44.709 --> 04:49.250
and, dramatic pause,
she wants a Joe from Jonas type.

04:49.333 --> 04:51.500
-I can play that.
-I know.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.208
That's amazing.
I'm gonna be in a movie.

04:53.291 --> 04:55.208
Totally.
Now, the audition is today.

04:55.291 --> 04:56.875
Whoa, whoa, wait.
There's an audition?

04:56.959 --> 04:58.583
Oh, it's just a formality.

04:59.125 --> 05:01.417
But they're looking for me.
How am I supposed to play myself?

05:01.500 --> 05:04.542
Joe, don't worry.
The part is as good as yours.

05:04.625 --> 05:06.709
We're gonna play
boyfriend and dead girlfriend.

05:06.792 --> 05:08.542
[both laughing]

05:16.166 --> 05:18.667
Stone and his crew are so chill,
all right.

05:18.750 --> 05:20.959
Once they see you with me,
you'll be part of the family.

05:21.041 --> 05:23.417
Yo, Stone!
[laughs]

05:23.500 --> 05:25.083
What's the haps, man?

05:27.083 --> 05:30.500
Hey, I know you.
You're, uh, from that band, right?

05:30.583 --> 05:32.083
Nick from Jonas.

05:32.166 --> 05:33.834
Stone from the ocean.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.458
Wait, do that again.
I want to get this for the site.

05:36.542 --> 05:38.625
Anything for you, photo fox.

05:38.709 --> 05:40.917
[giggling]

05:42.583 --> 05:44.166
'Cause I take photos.

05:44.250 --> 05:46.125
Shirts off, right?

05:46.750 --> 05:49.667
Uh, it's your beach.

05:53.458 --> 05:54.750
All right.

06:00.875 --> 06:03.750
The director said she wants
a Joe from Jonas type.

06:04.250 --> 06:06.834
How do I look more Joe-ish?

06:08.458 --> 06:12.083
OK, um, how about something
from, like, your last music video?

06:12.166 --> 06:14.583
So... leather jacket...
Do you like that?

06:14.667 --> 06:17.458
-Yeah.
-And glasses.

06:17.709 --> 06:20.083
-How about a bandanna?
-Classic Joe.

06:20.166 --> 06:22.333
Classic Joe.
I'm glad you I like it.

06:22.417 --> 06:24.917
Hi, they just emailed me
the scenes for your audition later.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.041
Cool.
Just put it over there.

06:27.291 --> 06:29.625
Uh, I don't know, man.
I was looking them over,

06:29.709 --> 06:32.750
and they're pretty emotional.
I think we should go over it.

06:32.834 --> 06:35.375
Kevin, what do you really
know about directing?

06:35.458 --> 06:37.875
Well, as much as you really
know about acting.

06:37.959 --> 06:40.208
The whole thing's practically a done deal.

06:40.291 --> 06:42.625
OK, man. Whatever.

06:44.959 --> 06:47.291
You know, Kevin's right.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.333
I mean, you've never done this before.
You should prepare.

06:50.417 --> 06:52.250
It's all about my look.

06:52.333 --> 06:54.709
Vanessa said the whole audition's
a formality.

06:54.792 --> 06:56.125
Vanessa?

06:56.208 --> 06:58.542
Well, she would know.

06:59.750 --> 07:01.875
You know there's nothing
going on between us, right?

07:02.000 --> 07:06.166
Yeah, yeah, I know. And even if there was,
I'd be fine with it.

07:06.458 --> 07:08.208
We agreed to be friends, so...

07:08.625 --> 07:10.166
You're the best.

07:11.667 --> 07:12.583
I know.

07:14.166 --> 07:16.083
-Do you like that one?
-Yeah.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.458
Aunt Lisa, hey.

07:23.083 --> 07:27.375
-Mind if I help you with those?
-Oh, I see what you're doing.

07:27.458 --> 07:29.917
You're trying to get on my good side.
[chuckles]

07:30.000 --> 07:32.500
It's not happening, no.
I don't trust rock stars.

07:32.583 --> 07:35.041
To carry your groceries?

07:35.875 --> 07:36.959
Good point.

07:38.417 --> 07:39.834
Thanks.

07:47.750 --> 07:50.000
So, what brings you
to my shred-quarters, Nick?

07:50.083 --> 07:52.417
We're here for the summer,
taking in the sights.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.125
All right, all right.

07:54.208 --> 07:57.250
Hey, you want a fish taco?
You want a fish taco.

07:57.333 --> 07:59.250
Guys, <i>dos</i> fish tacos:

07:59.333 --> 08:01.959
one for Nick and one for his
friend-girlfriend.

08:02.041 --> 08:03.583
-Whoa, she's not...
-We're just...

08:04.041 --> 08:06.041
Macy runs our website.

08:06.125 --> 08:09.625
Yeah? Well, I've got a web empire.
I use it to spread my message.

08:09.709 --> 08:12.250
It's all about easy livin',
saving the ocean.

08:12.333 --> 08:14.000
If you want to be cool, buy my stuff.

08:15.333 --> 08:17.125
Yeah, that's where I score my Stone Juice.

08:17.208 --> 08:19.250
It's the guava to get you, right, bro?

08:19.333 --> 08:22.792
-And for you it's on the house.
-Oh.

08:24.959 --> 08:28.250
Well, see, we're more about our fans
than selling stuff.

08:29.417 --> 08:30.625
That's noble.

08:31.166 --> 08:35.333
Hey, maybe I could interest you
in a position on my web team,

08:35.417 --> 08:37.333
working closely with me, of course.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.291
-Yeah--
-Yeah, she's gonna pass.

08:39.709 --> 08:40.750
I am?

08:40.834 --> 08:42.250
You're way too busy with the Jonas site.

08:42.333 --> 08:43.875
No. No, no, no...
No, I'm not.

08:43.959 --> 08:46.875
-We're on vacation.
-Where did you get that idea?

08:46.959 --> 08:49.542
From you this morning.
You said I was offline.

08:50.125 --> 08:53.542
Amigos, I don't want to make waves,
just want to ride 'em.

08:53.625 --> 08:57.125
But if you change your mind,
here's my card.

08:57.959 --> 09:00.834
Dudes, what's the ETA on those tacos?

09:01.917 --> 09:03.000
Hoo!

09:03.458 --> 09:05.375
-Thank you.
-[Macy] Thanks.

09:07.750 --> 09:09.834
It's cool.
I ate at home.

09:15.667 --> 09:18.083
-You want something to drink?
-[scoffs]

09:19.208 --> 09:21.500
-Hungry?
-Nope.

09:25.709 --> 09:26.834
So...

09:30.792 --> 09:32.166
[sighs]

09:32.250 --> 09:35.792
So, how exactly am I too busy
to work for Stone's website?

09:35.875 --> 09:37.542
Well, the truth is
I wanted to let you relax

09:37.625 --> 09:39.709
before I hit you with
all the big ideas for the site.

09:39.792 --> 09:42.542
Oh, I'm relaxed.
Hit me.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.125
Well, to start, pictures...

09:45.208 --> 09:48.083
band pictures, pictures of the band.

09:48.166 --> 09:50.041
So, you're saying more pictures.

09:50.125 --> 09:51.750
Yes, exactly.
Other stuff, website stuff,

09:51.834 --> 09:56.750
like weather reports, movie schedules,
uh, stock market reports.

09:56.875 --> 09:58.583
Did you know that Japan
has its own stock market?

09:58.667 --> 10:01.083
Yeah, I did, Nick. I did.

10:01.166 --> 10:02.875
Why don't you want me to work for Stone?

10:02.959 --> 10:05.250
'Cause Stone only wants you
to work for him 'cause you're pretty.

10:05.333 --> 10:09.917
-So, you're saying I'm pretty?
-I'm saying Stone thinks you're pretty.

10:10.417 --> 10:14.959
[scoffs] Wow.
Well, thank you for clearing that up.

10:15.583 --> 10:17.917
You know what?
You don't get to decide things for me.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.083
I do.

10:19.166 --> 10:21.125
And I just decided
that I'm gonna work for Stone.

10:21.208 --> 10:23.709
-No, you're not.
-Oh, yeah? Watch me. I quit.

10:24.834 --> 10:27.000
You can't quit,
because we don't pay you.

10:37.542 --> 10:40.000
-You got this, man.
-I know I got this, dude. No problem.

10:40.083 --> 10:41.834
We're gonna be late though.
Nick, where are you?

10:41.917 --> 10:43.125
-Nick!
-Have you guys seen Macy?

10:43.208 --> 10:44.750
No, no. Macy!

10:44.959 --> 10:46.875
There he is.
Nick, have you seen Macy?

10:46.959 --> 10:49.625
Yeah, I want her to film me
landing my first movie role.

10:49.709 --> 10:51.333
Where's the camera?
I'll do it.

10:52.333 --> 10:53.917
No, I want Macy.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.750
Yeah, you're not so good
with the pictures.

10:55.834 --> 11:00.166
-You like to cut off the heads.
-That is an artistic choice.

11:02.625 --> 11:06.208
Nick... where is she?

11:06.291 --> 11:09.208
Maybe she went shopping or quit
or went to get her hair done.

11:09.291 --> 11:11.250
You know, who knows what girls
do these days, right?

11:11.333 --> 11:13.750
Whoa, back up.
Macy went shopping without me?

11:13.834 --> 11:16.250
Wait, what was that middle one again?

11:18.417 --> 11:23.041
-She quit, OK? She quit.
-What did you do?

11:23.208 --> 11:25.542
I don't know. We were talking about
the Japanese stock market

11:25.625 --> 11:26.709
and she just went nuts.

11:26.792 --> 11:28.333
Nick, you must have
done something to hurt her.

11:28.417 --> 11:31.083
-You have to fix this.
-How?

11:31.166 --> 11:33.041
Guys, we gotta get to my audition.

11:33.125 --> 11:36.000
So, Nick, whatever you gotta do
to change her mind, do it.

Oh, hey, bro.
Just making sure your pool works.

12:09.458 --> 12:11.166
Listen, I need your help with something.

12:11.250 --> 12:12.792
Oh, be right there.

12:17.542 --> 12:20.166
That was touch-and-go for a second.

12:20.250 --> 12:21.792
What can I do you for, bro?

12:22.917 --> 12:26.166
Listen, if I had anybody else to ask,
I would.

12:26.250 --> 12:27.709
Oh, thanks, bro.

12:28.291 --> 12:31.542
OK, I'm gonna need a wet suit,
a surfboard and a ride from your mom.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.333
Done.
Where are we going?

12:33.417 --> 12:36.208
-Back to the beach.
-Oh, I love it.

12:46.125 --> 12:48.166
OK, buddy, you can do this.

12:48.250 --> 12:50.250
You're one of a kind.

It's Joe.

13:13.208 --> 13:14.458
Hey, dude.
Tell me you nailed it.

13:14.542 --> 13:17.291
There's a roomful of me's in there,
and I'm freaking out right now.

13:17.375 --> 13:19.625
It's OK.
Uh, just calm down.

13:19.709 --> 13:21.333
Breathe.
Remember everything I told you.

13:21.417 --> 13:24.417
Kevin, we're way past happy face/sad face.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.417
How am I supposed to get
in front of a famous director

13:26.500 --> 13:28.542
and do a love scene with real emotions?

13:33.667 --> 13:35.750
Hang in there, man.
I've got an idea.

13:38.875 --> 13:40.083
Ready, Joe?

13:41.709 --> 13:42.959
You mean me, right?

13:52.750 --> 13:54.750

This one looks all wrong.

13:55.500 --> 13:59.375
Oh, Mona, this actually is Joe from Jonas.

13:59.458 --> 14:04.125
-Well, OK. Mona Klein, a huge fan.
-Wow.

14:04.208 --> 14:05.750
All right, let's rock this.

14:07.667 --> 14:10.208
And action!

Don't you get it, Dade?
I'm a ghost.

14:15.625 --> 14:17.625
Ghosts can't love.

14:17.709 --> 14:22.792
They covet, they desire,
but they can't love.

14:22.875 --> 14:25.125
I could choose to believe that...

14:27.208 --> 14:29.291
but if we never try...

14:31.792 --> 14:34.375
then we'll never know
what could have been.

Cut.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.834
Is he in love
or is he ordering a cheeseburger?

14:38.917 --> 14:41.917
Just give him another chance.
He's a little nervous.

14:43.834 --> 14:46.959
-That was really terrible.
-I know. I'm sorry.

14:47.041 --> 14:48.333
Joe, look at me.

14:48.458 --> 14:50.625
You get to be in love with me.
It shouldn't be hard.

14:51.709 --> 14:54.959
-Can I please try again?
-You're lucky lunch hasn't arrived yet.

14:55.041 --> 14:56.959
All right, one more shot, rock star.

14:57.041 --> 14:59.250
What's that Taylor Lautner guy up to?

15:00.166 --> 15:02.417
And action!

15:02.500 --> 15:05.667
Don't you get it, Dade?
I'm a ghost.

15:05.750 --> 15:08.125
Ghosts can't love.

15:08.208 --> 15:13.583
They covet, they desire,
but they can't love.

15:47.375 --> 15:48.834
Dude, you might just turn out
to be a good director.

15:48.917 --> 15:50.834
Well, I do know how to motivate my actors.

15:51.750 --> 15:55.875
-Stella, I mean...
-I'm gonna go.

15:57.208 --> 16:00.125
When I saw you in the window,
I just felt so...

16:01.291 --> 16:05.417
Hey, sometimes you just need
to see a friendly face.

16:05.500 --> 16:09.250
Congratulations, Dade!
You were wonderful.

16:09.333 --> 16:11.667
I could totally feel
our energies colliding.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.875
-Vanessa, hi.
-Oh, hi.

16:15.959 --> 16:17.667
I'm Stella Malone.

16:17.750 --> 16:20.959
I love you on <i>Malibu High.</i>
I never miss an episode.

16:21.041 --> 16:22.583
That means so much.

16:22.667 --> 16:25.417
Oh, anyway, we are gonna be
working together a lot.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.250
It's going to be so intense.

16:28.333 --> 16:29.417
[whispers]
Thank you.

16:32.166 --> 16:33.750
So, where do we begin?

16:33.834 --> 16:35.792
[Joe and Vanessa continue indistinct]

16:45.583 --> 16:49.750
OK, rule number one: if you work for me,
you gotta learn how to surf.

16:49.834 --> 16:50.959
Oh, I'm in.

16:51.041 --> 16:53.166
All right, so stand like that.

16:53.250 --> 16:55.959
All right, now remember,
your shoulders are your steering wheel,

16:56.041 --> 16:57.291
so just keep it loose.

16:57.375 --> 17:00.125
-Oh, hey.
-What are you doing here?

17:00.208 --> 17:02.166
You want to work for a surfer?
Well, I'm a surfer.

17:02.250 --> 17:04.000
No, you're not, Nick.
You've never surfed in your life.

17:04.083 --> 17:05.709
How hard could it be?

17:05.792 --> 17:08.417
Dude, I make surfing look easy
because I'm great.

17:08.500 --> 17:12.000
Now, you make being a rock star
look easy because... it is.

17:12.208 --> 17:13.375
Get the difference?

17:14.875 --> 17:16.709
We'll see... dude.

17:21.917 --> 17:23.375
What are you doing?

17:26.834 --> 17:30.208
-Is that dude always this crazy?
-No, never.

17:30.291 --> 17:32.333
You must bring it out in him.

17:46.250 --> 17:47.375
Oh!

17:48.458 --> 17:49.542
Nick!

17:49.750 --> 17:51.667
[coughing]

18:00.250 --> 18:01.542
Are you OK?

18:02.458 --> 18:05.500
Stone was right.
Surfing's hard.

18:06.750 --> 18:08.917
What has gotten into you?

18:09.834 --> 18:13.583
-This whole Stone thing got me thinking.
-About what?

18:13.834 --> 18:16.500
You just seem different this summer.

18:16.750 --> 18:18.542
Good different.

18:20.083 --> 18:23.166
Yeah, I guess I'm not
that crazy fan girl anymore.

18:25.417 --> 18:27.917
Look, Macy, if you want to
go work for Stone,

18:28.000 --> 18:29.917
I have no right to stand in your way.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.291
In fact... I don't think I can stand.

18:34.375 --> 18:35.667
[chuckles]

18:35.750 --> 18:38.291
I'm just worried that
if you do go work for him,

18:38.375 --> 18:40.959
we won't be able to spend
as much time together.

18:43.750 --> 18:46.458
Oh. Wow.

18:48.792 --> 18:49.875
You know, I...

18:49.959 --> 18:52.834
I think I'm gonna pass
on this whole Stone Stevens thing,

18:52.917 --> 18:55.500
so that should free me up
for some hanging out time.

18:56.709 --> 18:58.834
-Cool.
-OK.
