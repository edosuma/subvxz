01:31.691 --> 01:33.959
My name is Maurice.

01:33.961 --> 01:35.494
I'm French.

01:35.895 --> 01:39.198
I haven't been here
in New York for long.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.066
In Brooklyn.

01:41.068 --> 01:45.304
I left France, but if I
talk to you in English,

01:45.306 --> 01:48.006
it's because the
director asked me to.

01:48.975 --> 01:50.943
I don't really talk much.

01:52.078 --> 01:53.812
I won't talk much.

02:51.938 --> 02:54.239
My name is Maurice.

02:54.241 --> 02:56.475
I don't really exist.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.644
I'm just an image on the screen.

03:13.826 --> 03:15.027
People don't like that.

03:15.029 --> 03:16.628
They don't like it.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.867
Is it ok for you?

06:08.869 --> 06:10.969
Yeah, sure it's huge.

06:10.971 --> 06:13.972
Yeah, do you like the wall?

06:14.941 --> 06:16.975
It's interesting.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.410
I just put it in.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.679
I'm not quite sure about
it, but I think I like it.

06:22.181 --> 06:24.015
But make yourself at home.

06:24.017 --> 06:27.619
Come on, coat off,
hat off, relax.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.790
Lie on the bed, take a
nap, light your candles.

06:32.425 --> 06:34.359
If you need anything
I'll be in the kitchen.

06:34.361 --> 06:35.327
Ok.

06:35.329 --> 06:36.194
See you in a little bit.

06:36.196 --> 06:37.696
Thank you.

06:48.341 --> 06:51.710
So if I give you a room,
and maybe you can help

06:51.712 --> 06:56.214
do dishes, or help clean just
a little bit around the house,

06:56.216 --> 06:57.949
or even downstairs in the bar.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.885
Do you think you could do that?

07:00.353 --> 07:01.319
Yeah sure.

07:01.321 --> 07:02.721
Yeah?

07:03.756 --> 07:05.023
Hello darling.

07:05.025 --> 07:05.791
Hey.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.125
This is Maurice.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.427
New baby.

07:08.429 --> 07:09.461
Nice find.

07:09.463 --> 07:11.096
Thanks.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.667
All right babe, we
gotta talk about John.

07:15.669 --> 07:18.236
You know, I love him, I
know he's your friend,

07:18.238 --> 07:19.938
but he's pocketing money.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.840
I don't trust him.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.742
He's gotta go, ok?

07:24.377 --> 07:26.678
So I'm gonna have to do it.

07:36.823 --> 07:37.823
What's your name again?

07:37.825 --> 07:38.657
Maurice.

07:38.659 --> 07:39.858
Here.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.059
What is this?

07:41.061 --> 07:42.227
Candles.

07:42.229 --> 07:45.096
Come on, let's
deal with John, fuck.

07:45.098 --> 07:48.500
All right, all right,
come on, we gotta go.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.135
We gotta go talk to him.

07:55.074 --> 07:57.242
I'll show you
the bar and what to do.

07:57.844 --> 07:59.244
Ok.

07:59.246 --> 08:00.178
You can meet the
people who work there.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.147
They're nice, they'll like you.

08:41.220 --> 08:43.455
Go ahead and grab a mop
from the closet over there,

08:43.457 --> 08:47.125
and give the floor
a good once-over,

08:47.127 --> 08:49.828
and then after that you can
help me take down the rest

08:49.830 --> 08:53.899
of these chairs, and after that
you can probably go see Kim

08:53.901 --> 08:55.967
downstairs in the basement.

08:55.969 --> 08:58.937
She's probably gonna have a lot
of work for you tonight too.

08:58.939 --> 09:02.040
It's Tuesday so it's probably
not gonna be that busy,

09:02.042 --> 09:05.043
you know, I mean it's
gonna be pretty quiet,

09:05.045 --> 09:10.115
but the main thing is to just
make sure everything's tidy,

09:10.216 --> 09:13.285
clean, make sure everybody's
drinks are refilled,

09:13.287 --> 09:17.322
their waters, and make sure
you wipe down the tables.

09:17.324 --> 09:18.523
Right?

09:18.525 --> 09:19.991
That's important.

09:28.134 --> 09:30.235
Welcome to bushwick burlesque,

09:30.237 --> 09:33.138
scary bear's bawdy
birthday ball,

09:33.140 --> 09:34.506
is that what it said
on the Internet?

09:34.508 --> 09:35.507
I think
so, something like that.

09:35.509 --> 09:36.841
Exuberance both.

09:36.843 --> 09:39.210
Exuberance both.

09:39.212 --> 09:43.448
We are celebrating the
birthday of our own peddler

09:43.450 --> 09:44.649
of exuberant both...

09:44.651 --> 09:45.550
that's me.

09:45.552 --> 09:46.818
Mr scary bear.

09:46.820 --> 09:50.388
Thanks friends,
family, whores, sluts,

09:51.324 --> 09:54.192
general acquaintances,
and people off the street.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.094
Thank you so much for coming.

10:23.222 --> 10:25.991
Baby, you gonna
come say, "goodnight?"

10:37.103 --> 10:38.336
- Betty.
- - Hi.

10:39.605 --> 10:41.306
Goodnight.

10:43.175 --> 10:44.109
Night.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.011
How's your room?

10:46.013 --> 10:46.878
It'll do fine.

10:46.880 --> 10:47.646
- Good?
- Yeah.

10:47.648 --> 10:48.747
All right.

10:48.749 --> 10:49.748
Sleep well.

10:49.750 --> 10:50.749
See you.

10:50.751 --> 10:51.850
Bye.

10:53.986 --> 10:56.154
They're stuck.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.055
The eggs?

10:57.057 --> 10:58.356
Mmhmm.

10:58.358 --> 10:59.958
They're stuck in the pack.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.526
Look.

11:04.630 --> 11:05.897
It's true.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.499
You could
just pour it in there.

11:11.604 --> 11:12.771
Do you need me to do anything?

11:12.773 --> 11:14.072
I feel bad just sitting.

11:14.074 --> 11:15.607
No, it's fine.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.045
You're so good to us.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.680
Hello!

11:21.682 --> 11:23.214
How are you?

11:23.216 --> 11:26.785
Good good good, I brought
croissants for the French boy.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.520
Wow, special treatment.

11:28.522 --> 11:30.221
So help yourself.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.489
Hi babe how are you?

11:31.491 --> 11:32.791
Oh good, how are you?

11:32.793 --> 11:34.092
What are you making?

11:35.428 --> 11:36.861
- Good to see you.
- You too.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.430
So I got a couple of chocolate,

11:38.432 --> 11:41.433
and a couple of I think almond.

11:41.435 --> 11:44.335
Ooh, for you.

11:44.570 --> 11:46.237
Do you have a mug?

11:46.972 --> 11:48.339
Mmm, do you want?

11:48.341 --> 11:50.341
How was it last night?

11:50.343 --> 11:51.443
I didn't work last night,

11:51.445 --> 11:52.644
but I heard it's pretty shitty.

11:52.646 --> 11:54.512
Who played last night?

11:55.614 --> 11:57.348
It was a dj, I think it
was David or something,

11:57.350 --> 11:58.616
I don't remember.

11:58.618 --> 11:59.884
New?

11:59.886 --> 12:02.087
No an old one we used but...

12:02.089 --> 12:03.354
we haven't used him
in a while though.

12:03.356 --> 12:04.856
We should start using him more.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.157
Why did we stop?

12:06.159 --> 12:09.227
It just gets expensive
after a while, you know?

12:09.229 --> 12:11.830
If they're not gonna
bring people, it's like,

12:11.832 --> 12:13.932
why spend that much
money, you know?

12:13.934 --> 12:15.533
And you, how was your night?

12:15.535 --> 12:17.035
It was good, good, yeah.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.269
How are your eggs?

12:18.271 --> 12:20.572
Oh, um, they're good, yeah.

12:20.574 --> 12:21.406
They're good?

12:21.408 --> 12:22.107
They're what?

12:22.109 --> 12:23.408
Good or cold?

12:24.744 --> 12:26.177
Yeah tell us
more about yourself.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.345
Yeah when's your birthday?

12:27.347 --> 12:28.279
We need to know everything.

12:28.281 --> 12:29.481
Yeah, are you a virgin?

12:29.483 --> 12:30.782
Did you run away?

12:30.784 --> 12:32.584
Like your parents?

12:34.754 --> 12:36.154
I don't know.

12:36.156 --> 12:37.422
Who do you like
more, your mom or your dad?

12:37.424 --> 12:39.524
- Mom.
- - Mom?

12:39.526 --> 12:40.892
Makes sense.

12:41.060 --> 12:42.594
You look
really pretty like this.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.262
And I'm not usually?

12:46.031 --> 12:47.732
You're an asshole.

13:29.175 --> 13:31.376
This job's kind of stupid.

13:32.578 --> 13:35.613
But we make a lot
of fucking money.

15:07.406 --> 15:08.806
So how was your first day?

15:08.808 --> 15:09.741
Hmm?

15:09.743 --> 15:11.442
How was your first day?

15:11.944 --> 15:16.047
Washing dishes, what about you?

15:17.149 --> 15:18.716
It's good, I'm tired.

15:18.718 --> 15:20.285
Oh I see.

15:22.121 --> 15:23.922
You see the show at all?

15:23.924 --> 15:25.890
Yeah, yeah I did.

15:25.892 --> 15:28.960
It was cool, well it's
strange, but cool.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.461
Yeah?

15:32.097 --> 15:33.798
Did you do all these?

15:35.901 --> 15:37.669
Yeah I did.

15:38.570 --> 15:40.438
Ok, well I'll see you tomorrow.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.773
See you.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.975
You did very
well today at the bar.

15:43.977 --> 15:44.943
Well thank you.

15:44.945 --> 15:46.511
No thank you.

15:46.513 --> 15:47.445
You see him?

15:47.447 --> 15:48.613
Yeah he did all right.

15:48.615 --> 15:49.747
She gives you no love.

15:49.749 --> 15:51.249
You did very well.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.250
Thanks.

15:52.252 --> 15:53.451
- Yes?
- Yes.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.719
Would you
keep us company tonight?

15:54.721 --> 15:56.554
- Oh, yeah.
- - Yeah?

15:56.556 --> 15:58.623
- Yeah.
- I think that's a good idea.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.224
You have to take your
underwear off though.

16:00.226 --> 16:01.993
Really?

16:01.995 --> 16:03.895
- It's the rule.
- Ok.

16:03.897 --> 16:04.862
Those are the rules.

16:04.864 --> 16:06.564
Ok.

16:07.066 --> 16:08.633
So shy all the time, why?

16:08.635 --> 16:10.034
I know, so nervous.

16:10.036 --> 16:11.769
Is it something
to do with that?

16:11.771 --> 16:13.604
Yes it totally is that.

16:13.606 --> 16:16.240
Wow, I'm impressed baby.

16:16.242 --> 16:18.476
I choose wow, come on Kim.

16:18.478 --> 16:19.844
You should behave.

16:19.846 --> 16:21.326
You should
know me better than that.

16:21.613 --> 16:23.815
You have to behave, we're
not having sex with you.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.483
- All right.
- So you know.

16:27.019 --> 16:30.755
Again, she's rough,
more mature, but come on.

16:37.563 --> 16:39.864
- Good night baby.
- Night.

17:18.737 --> 17:20.805
You know this is the
only bathroom here right?

17:20.807 --> 17:22.773
Ah yeah, sorry.

17:26.578 --> 17:28.079
That's the problem
with you teenagers,

17:28.080 --> 17:31.115
you're either dirty or you
take showers for an hour.

20:55.420 --> 20:56.887
Is it filming?

20:56.889 --> 20:59.590
Yeah it's filming man,
of course it's filming.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.158
Look at my baby.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.261
Look at the baby.

21:03.263 --> 21:07.131
Baby needs to get clean,
takes an hour long shower.

21:09.601 --> 21:12.303
Baby's gotta get clean.

21:13.338 --> 21:15.273
Good job mommy.

21:15.275 --> 21:16.641
Of course.

21:18.043 --> 21:20.111
Drop the soap.

21:20.113 --> 21:23.080
Just for fun purposes.

21:25.317 --> 21:28.486
Oh fuck girl, it's
all getting wet no?

21:28.920 --> 21:30.855
No this thing
can go under the water.

21:30.857 --> 21:33.090
No fuck you,
you're gonna break my phone.

21:33.092 --> 21:35.126
No it can go under the water.

21:35.128 --> 21:37.461
Fuck you, it's
going black, it's gonna...

21:40.666 --> 21:42.099
oh fuck!

21:42.101 --> 21:43.968
You fucking broke my phone.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.770
Oh, you can get a new one.

21:45.772 --> 21:47.905
You broke it, what the hell?

21:47.907 --> 21:49.073
You know what, it's the case.

21:49.075 --> 21:50.441
No, that is not ok!

21:50.443 --> 21:54.378
Ok, that's the
reception is over here.

21:54.913 --> 21:59.884
Ok, this is the clothes for
sale for people came to the gym.

22:01.553 --> 22:04.989
This is the punching
bag over here,

22:04.991 --> 22:08.426
and those weights you
can have here every day,

22:08.428 --> 22:10.661
and lift weight for the gym.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.139
- One, two, three.
- Ok.

22:22.141 --> 22:24.342
One, two, three, yes?

22:25.911 --> 22:27.211
One, two, three.

22:27.213 --> 22:28.579
One, two, three.

22:28.581 --> 22:30.481
One, two, three.

22:30.483 --> 22:31.982
Uppercut, yes.

22:31.984 --> 22:34.285
One, two, three, yes very good.

22:34.287 --> 22:37.355
Very good, very good, yes.

22:37.357 --> 22:39.623
Ok, one, two, yes.

22:42.027 --> 22:44.328
And left, right.

22:44.596 --> 22:46.597
- Don't use too much power.
- - Ok.

22:46.599 --> 22:48.065
Don't use too much power.

22:48.067 --> 22:50.134
Yes, left, right, uppercut, yes.

22:50.136 --> 22:53.571
Left, right, uppercut.

24:54.025 --> 24:56.660
- Is that a bed?
- - Yep.

24:58.563 --> 25:01.866
Oh man, why you
wanna sleep here?

25:02.501 --> 25:03.834
I don't want to sleep here,

25:03.836 --> 25:06.670
but I left my keys
at my apartment,

25:06.672 --> 25:07.972
and my roommate's mad at me,

25:07.974 --> 25:09.840
so this is kinda
the only choice.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.075
So bad.

25:11.077 --> 25:13.611
It's not so bad,
I've done it before.

25:14.546 --> 25:16.580
Actually pretty comfortable.

25:16.582 --> 25:18.015
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

25:18.017 --> 25:20.017
- This?
- Yeah.

25:20.019 --> 25:22.553
Oh man, I would
not sleep on this.

25:23.788 --> 25:25.823
Well I don't
really have a choice.

25:27.893 --> 25:31.762
Maybe if you want, you
could spend a night upstairs.

25:32.631 --> 25:33.864
Where?

25:33.866 --> 25:35.833
My room.

25:37.636 --> 25:38.969
In your room?

25:38.971 --> 25:40.871
Only for a night.

25:41.506 --> 25:42.473
Ok.

25:55.487 --> 25:58.622
Your ceiling's falling down.

25:58.624 --> 26:00.624
Yep.

26:00.626 --> 26:02.726
Doesn't matter.

26:05.630 --> 26:06.830
Night.

26:08.733 --> 26:10.134
Goodnight.

26:20.545 --> 26:22.413
No, I understand
what you're saying,

26:22.415 --> 26:24.348
I understand why
you're doing it,

26:24.350 --> 26:27.651
I'm just really would
appreciate a week.

26:27.653 --> 26:29.853
Just give me a week, two weeks?

26:29.855 --> 26:31.555
Two weeks, you'll
give me two weeks?

26:31.557 --> 26:33.824
We have things
coming up I promise.

26:34.359 --> 26:37.628
No I'm, come on, you know me.

26:37.630 --> 26:39.964
You know me, yeah?

26:40.565 --> 26:42.132
Can you?

26:44.703 --> 26:47.705
Ok, yes, no I hear
you, I hear you.

26:48.740 --> 26:50.975
So a week, you'll
give me one week?

26:51.643 --> 26:53.544
Ok? Ok.

26:53.546 --> 26:55.245
Thank you, I appreciate it.

26:55.247 --> 26:56.547
Bye.

27:00.151 --> 27:01.552
Fuck.

27:10.462 --> 27:11.695
Good morning.

27:11.697 --> 27:13.464
- Morning.
- Morning.

27:13.466 --> 27:15.366
You two sleeping together now,

27:15.368 --> 27:16.533
and burning my toast?

27:16.535 --> 27:18.902
Yeah I burnt your toast, sorry.

27:18.904 --> 27:21.038
Strictly platonic
I can assure you.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.874
Sleeping
together, burning my toast.

27:23.876 --> 27:25.509
I'm sorry.

27:25.511 --> 27:26.510
He's burnt
like four pieces now.

27:26.512 --> 27:28.078
No, only two.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.313
You ate the other two.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.181
No I didn't.

27:33.785 --> 27:36.987
I'm fucking
tired, didn't sleep at all.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.722
Wine for breakfast?

27:39.991 --> 27:41.992
It's better than burnt toast.

27:54.072 --> 27:55.239
I'm Luka.

27:55.241 --> 27:57.274
Of course, nice to meet you.

27:57.276 --> 27:59.009
Nice to meet you.

28:45.757 --> 28:49.393
Doesn't it bother
you watching us working

28:49.395 --> 28:51.895
while doing nothing?

28:51.897 --> 28:55.199
- You call that working?
- Fuck you!

29:20.959 --> 29:23.727
This is my bed, you
wanna sleep downstairs?

29:23.729 --> 29:25.529
No, no, no.

29:33.104 --> 29:36.340
French boy, full of mystery huh?

29:40.712 --> 29:42.312
That's fine.

29:48.686 --> 29:51.755
I don't know, I just feel,

29:54.559 --> 29:56.727
I feel like I could
tell you anything right?

30:05.804 --> 30:10.874
I haven't really been able
to trust people very often

30:12.944 --> 30:16.613
but you're easy to
talk to you know?

30:20.418 --> 30:22.452
I feel like you're listening.

30:24.355 --> 30:25.989
You're listening.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.760
I feel like you care.

30:34.299 --> 30:37.334
We're not so different you know?

30:56.788 --> 31:02.860
Um, when I first saw
you, I thought you were

31:03.928 --> 31:08.999
just some asshole
kid but I don't know,

31:12.136 --> 31:14.371
there's just
something about you.

31:36.761 --> 31:38.962
I think I love you.

32:36.087 --> 32:37.654
You're a good guy.

36:00.558 --> 36:02.959
You wanna make
sure the audience can see it.

36:02.961 --> 36:06.429
Ok and I want you to
give me your best shot,

36:06.431 --> 36:08.965
into here ok?

36:09.133 --> 36:11.401
What are you gonna
do a straight punch?

36:11.602 --> 36:13.136
- Yep.
- Awesome.

36:13.138 --> 36:14.471
Here we go, thank you Johnny.

36:14.473 --> 36:15.605
Here we go.

36:15.607 --> 36:17.407
Ready, you're gonna
give me the eye.

36:17.409 --> 36:19.376
I'm ready, ok.

36:23.681 --> 36:25.849
Take a step back.

36:26.918 --> 36:28.885
Right, one more, and
really really pound

36:28.887 --> 36:31.454
that shit into my fuckin' gut.

36:31.756 --> 36:33.256
Hit me!

36:41.966 --> 36:45.502
Oh fuck, gawd, I hate you
so much fucking racism.

36:55.012 --> 36:57.881
Homophobia.

37:04.155 --> 37:05.422
Hold it down.

37:05.424 --> 37:09.392
I'm gonna beat
homophobia into the past.

37:09.894 --> 37:12.362
Argh, I hate you homophobia!

39:51.055 --> 39:53.089
Come on, it's the beach.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.329
Oh, get off, I'm wet!

39:59.331 --> 40:01.097
Stop, stop.

40:06.670 --> 40:08.371
So where's France?

40:09.607 --> 40:10.507
Is it there?

40:10.509 --> 40:11.875
Man, I don't know.

40:11.877 --> 40:13.309
Is it over there?

40:13.311 --> 40:14.811
Is it over there?

40:14.813 --> 40:16.379
No.

40:16.981 --> 40:18.515
I don't know where it is.

40:18.517 --> 40:20.183
It's straight through.

40:20.185 --> 40:22.118
I don't care.

40:23.721 --> 40:26.523
- Do you miss it?
- No.

40:49.847 --> 40:54.584
Well I'll move my
knight from here to here.

40:55.820 --> 40:57.420
- Ok.
- Your turn.

40:57.422 --> 41:00.056
I'll move my pawn here.

41:01.826 --> 41:06.896
Mmm, and my knight here.

41:10.067 --> 41:12.101
I'll move my pawn here.

41:12.603 --> 41:14.070
My knight here.

41:14.405 --> 41:15.872
I ate your pawn.

41:16.307 --> 41:19.008
- You ate it?
- Yep.

41:19.010 --> 41:21.544
- You ate my pawn?
- Yep.

41:21.546 --> 41:23.680
- You captured my pawn.
- No I ate it.

41:23.682 --> 41:25.882
You didn't eat it.

41:25.884 --> 41:30.820
Ok, all right, well I'll
move my knight here.

41:32.423 --> 41:37.393
Hmm, I move my bishop...

41:40.631 --> 41:42.198
Freddy.

41:42.200 --> 41:43.833
- How are you?
- How are you?

41:43.835 --> 41:45.935
I'm good, I'm good,
what are you doing here?

41:45.937 --> 41:47.637
- I live here.
- - You live here?

41:47.639 --> 41:48.771
Yeah, like down the block.

41:48.773 --> 41:51.074
Oh my god, um this is Maurice.

41:51.076 --> 41:53.510
Hi, how are you, I'm Freddy.

41:53.512 --> 41:55.011
Yeah what are
you up to tonight?

41:55.013 --> 41:56.413
Nothing, what are
you doing tonight?

41:56.414 --> 41:58.681
Well, you know, sittin'.

41:58.683 --> 42:00.884
- So nothing?
- Yep.

42:00.886 --> 42:02.919
We're playing chess.

42:02.921 --> 42:04.721
- Who's winning?
- - I am.

42:08.292 --> 42:09.526
It's your turn,

42:09.528 --> 42:13.863
I'll take my unicorn
from here to maybe here.

42:14.398 --> 42:15.932
That's cool, sounds good.

42:15.934 --> 42:17.333
- I think that wins.
- - Yeah.

42:17.335 --> 42:18.668
I think unicorns win.

42:18.670 --> 42:20.069
There's no
fighting with a unicorn.

42:20.071 --> 42:21.971
- No.
- - Checkmate.

42:21.973 --> 42:24.274
Good game, good job.

42:24.276 --> 42:26.109
Thank you, thank you.

42:52.736 --> 42:54.003
Come on ladies.

42:54.005 --> 42:55.838
- Excusé moi.
- Excuse me.

42:55.840 --> 42:58.474
Ladies? Thank you.

46:03.627 --> 46:05.628
Hey Luka you can go babe.

46:05.630 --> 46:06.596
Are you sure?

46:06.598 --> 46:08.431
Mmhmm, we got it.

46:08.433 --> 46:10.233
Ok.

46:12.503 --> 46:14.270
Betty what the
fuck are you doing?

46:14.272 --> 46:16.405
Having a drink.

46:16.407 --> 46:18.040
You're not supposed
to drink when you work,

46:18.042 --> 46:18.975
you know that.

46:18.977 --> 46:21.144
No one's here right now.

46:22.679 --> 46:24.547
No one's here right now.

46:24.549 --> 46:26.983
You've been drinking
all fucking night.

46:26.985 --> 46:28.684
People were
there and they wanted

46:28.686 --> 46:30.219
me to drink with them.

46:30.221 --> 46:32.355
This isn't a fucking party,
this is a business to be run.

46:32.357 --> 46:33.523
Do you understand that?

46:33.525 --> 46:35.024
Yes.

46:35.026 --> 46:36.058
Yes, you
understand that that's why

46:36.060 --> 46:37.460
you're fucked up right now?

46:37.462 --> 46:39.228
How much did we make tonight?

46:39.230 --> 46:40.596
Let me see.

46:42.232 --> 46:44.367
Are you fucking kidding me?

46:44.369 --> 46:46.502
This is how much we have?

46:46.504 --> 46:47.970
I'm sorry.

46:47.972 --> 46:49.472
You're sorry.

46:49.474 --> 46:52.475
You know earlier tonight we
had 200 more dollars in there?

46:52.477 --> 46:54.610
- You know that?
- No.

46:54.612 --> 46:55.711
You know we're losing this bar

46:55.713 --> 46:57.713
every fucking
dollar it's making?

46:57.715 --> 46:59.982
I don't care about the
bar, I'm worried about you.

46:59.984 --> 47:01.450
No get away from me.

47:01.452 --> 47:02.618
Get away from me.

47:02.620 --> 47:04.387
Everything's not ok right now.

47:04.389 --> 47:06.556
You need to go
upstairs and go to bed.

47:07.090 --> 47:08.391
Now.

47:08.992 --> 47:10.693
Now!

47:11.495 --> 47:14.230
Fine, I'm going, I'm going.

47:14.232 --> 47:15.698
Will you come with me?

47:15.700 --> 47:18.968
Just fucking go, I'm
not fucking coming with you.

47:20.103 --> 47:23.306
- Go!
- I'm going, I'm going.

47:55.038 --> 47:57.707
Come on, give me one.

47:57.709 --> 47:59.475
Give me one right on
the chin, come on.

47:59.477 --> 48:01.477
Come on, come on.

48:01.479 --> 48:02.645
Talking dirty.

48:02.647 --> 48:04.680
Come on you bitch,
come on, come on.

48:04.682 --> 48:06.716
Come on, come on bitch.

48:21.465 --> 48:22.932
Come in harder.

48:22.934 --> 48:24.500
You going light on me?

48:24.502 --> 48:25.768
You sleeping on me?

48:25.770 --> 48:27.503
Come on you guys.

48:30.073 --> 48:31.507
You're fucking taller than me.

48:31.509 --> 48:34.277
All right, if anything bad
happens have you got him?

48:34.279 --> 48:36.078
Yeah.

49:09.246 --> 49:11.414
I can give you a free
lesson if you want.

49:11.416 --> 49:13.616
- Really?
- Yeah.

49:13.618 --> 49:16.953
- Ok.
- Come by next week.

49:16.955 --> 49:18.788
I've trained a couple of people.

49:18.790 --> 49:20.523
- Ok.
- Just my friends though.

49:20.525 --> 49:21.791
Just friends?

49:21.793 --> 49:23.426
So it's special,
you should feel special.

49:23.428 --> 49:25.861
Oh ok, I do feel special.

49:26.563 --> 49:29.298
Why don't you come
boxing pretty boy?

49:29.300 --> 49:31.934
I'd be eaten alive.

49:32.602 --> 49:35.671
They don't like my
kind over there.

49:35.673 --> 49:37.406
They'll get used to you.

49:38.775 --> 49:39.775
He's laughing at you.

49:39.777 --> 49:42.178
Yeah he is, fuck you.

49:42.813 --> 49:45.147
I think you need a
couple more lessons.

50:28.625 --> 50:31.460
- So you work here?
- I do.

50:31.462 --> 50:33.496
Why are you here
on your day off?

50:33.498 --> 50:35.965
I live upstairs too.

50:35.967 --> 50:38.067
- Makes sense.
- Yeah.

50:39.202 --> 50:41.404
- Cool.
- I like it.

50:41.406 --> 50:43.839
They're really
nice, Kim and Betty.

50:45.609 --> 50:48.244
They own the bar.

50:48.246 --> 50:50.880
I don't know them,
I just know Maurice.

50:50.882 --> 50:52.882
Oh.

50:52.884 --> 50:55.217
Got it from boxing,
we share towels.

50:55.219 --> 50:57.586
Oh do you?

50:58.422 --> 50:59.922
I bet.

50:59.924 --> 51:02.124
Are you even gay?

51:02.859 --> 51:07.530
No, not at all.

51:15.772 --> 51:17.073
Ok.

51:20.143 --> 51:23.179
I like girls, and
you look like a girl.

51:23.713 --> 51:25.281
Thank you.

51:27.184 --> 51:29.785
So you'll just do anything
that looks like a girl?

51:30.954 --> 51:33.956
I'll do anything that moves.

51:33.958 --> 51:35.958
I move.

52:25.675 --> 52:27.109
Luka.

52:42.993 --> 52:44.360
All right.

52:46.630 --> 52:48.864
This is my bedroom.

52:49.766 --> 52:51.433
This is my bed.

52:53.837 --> 52:55.804
Is that what you want?

53:16.626 --> 53:18.527
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

53:20.564 --> 53:21.830
Huh?

53:22.832 --> 53:24.900
Fine, don't say anything.

53:24.902 --> 53:27.002
This is what you wanted right?

53:28.572 --> 53:30.039
Huh?

53:31.107 --> 53:34.009
So I slept with
Charlie, big deal.

53:34.377 --> 53:36.912
Can you leave?

53:36.914 --> 53:38.881
Shut the fuck up.

53:41.685 --> 53:44.153
It was your idea
to begin with you know.

53:44.354 --> 53:46.589
You said you just
wanna be friends.

53:47.724 --> 53:50.259
Can you please leave?

53:59.536 --> 54:00.936
Happy?

54:03.006 --> 54:05.374
Can you tell me what you want?

54:05.775 --> 54:07.776
Anything, say anything!

54:14.284 --> 54:19.321
You know, I really
thought, never mind.

54:22.759 --> 54:24.360
Whatever.

54:40.076 --> 54:42.111
- Who are you?
- Charlie

54:43.580 --> 54:45.981
- oh Maurice's friend, sorry.
- - Ok.

54:46.549 --> 54:47.216
Who are you?

54:47.218 --> 54:49.018
Kim, the owner.

54:49.020 --> 54:50.986
Kim the owner.

54:50.988 --> 54:52.755
You don't have any jobs do you?

54:52.757 --> 54:54.990
No not right now.

54:54.992 --> 54:56.592
All right.

54:58.561 --> 54:59.795
You know, you can
leave your number

54:59.797 --> 55:01.430
at the bar though if you want.

55:01.432 --> 55:03.899
- Ok.
- What's your name again?

55:03.901 --> 55:07.002
- Charlie.
- Charlie, ok.

55:07.004 --> 55:09.138
- Thanks Kim.
- Yeah.

57:13.730 --> 57:15.431
What is this?

57:16.166 --> 57:17.900
It's a tattoo.

57:18.868 --> 57:22.304
I see, but, "j'ai douleur."

57:23.473 --> 57:26.241
This is not French.

57:26.243 --> 57:27.342
What do you mean?

57:27.344 --> 57:30.512
I mean, this is wrong.

57:30.514 --> 57:33.982
In French you will never
say, "j'ai douleur."

57:35.285 --> 57:37.486
You will say, don't know,

57:38.855 --> 57:41.457
j'ai mal, je souffre,

57:41.459 --> 57:44.226
but never, "j'ai douleur."

57:46.830 --> 57:50.132
- Great.
- - Why?

57:52.068 --> 57:53.368
Why what?

57:53.370 --> 57:55.604
Why, "j'ai douleur?"

57:56.940 --> 58:00.008
- Why did I get it?
- Yeah, what happened?

58:08.451 --> 58:10.953
Back when I lived in Florida,

58:10.955 --> 58:14.790
I dated this guy
for about four years

58:16.659 --> 58:19.828
and then I found out
that he had been sleeping

58:19.830 --> 58:23.432
with my best friend
for about two years,

58:24.801 --> 58:29.771
so I got the tattoo and
packed up all my things,

58:30.540 --> 58:33.442
and I just moved to New York.

58:40.149 --> 58:41.783
Stupid right?

58:42.352 --> 58:46.355
No, it's full of sense.

58:48.925 --> 58:50.993
Full of mystery.

58:59.068 --> 59:00.903
It's ok right now.

59:01.905 --> 59:03.372
Je ne pas douleur.

59:05.975 --> 59:07.809
Je ne pas douleur.

59:10.680 --> 59:12.748
Everybody's got, "douleur."

59:12.750 --> 59:15.183
- Douleur.
- Douleur.

59:20.023 --> 59:21.857
Yeah you're right.

59:47.483 --> 59:50.018
You're a big freakin'
kid you know that?

59:50.787 --> 59:52.654
Just a big child.

59:55.592 --> 59:57.326
It's all right.

01:00:02.198 --> 01:00:04.633
Give me your hand.

01:00:05.401 --> 01:00:07.202
The other one.

01:00:09.205 --> 01:00:11.573
Put it down on the stage.

01:00:15.645 --> 01:00:17.479
Like this.

01:00:31.561 --> 01:00:34.396
Do you carry that knife
around with you everywhere?

01:00:46.909 --> 01:00:48.810
Do you trust me?

01:00:50.346 --> 01:00:52.314
I hardly know you.

01:01:27.216 --> 01:01:29.151
Turn yourself.

01:01:43.032 --> 01:01:45.667
Starting now, you
can't look at my face

01:01:45.669 --> 01:01:48.036
during the night anymore.

01:02:25.141 --> 01:02:27.542
Community chest, all right.

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:29.311
Go to jail.

01:02:29.313 --> 01:02:31.480
That's great.

01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:33.615
I'll sell it to you for 500.

01:02:33.617 --> 01:02:36.885
No, I'm not buying your,
"get out of jail free card."

01:02:36.887 --> 01:02:38.453
I'm gonna get out my own way.

01:02:38.455 --> 01:02:40.222
Oh, sexy like this.

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:42.257
Ah, move please, we're
playing "monopoly,"

01:02:42.259 --> 01:02:43.959
this is serious.

01:02:44.193 --> 01:02:46.495
How do you live
with yourself Charlie?

01:02:48.297 --> 01:02:51.700
Oh, you're disgusting,
fuck you, move!

01:02:52.168 --> 01:02:53.969
Don't touch me.

01:02:55.671 --> 01:02:57.372
Move!

01:02:57.573 --> 01:02:59.474
Charlie, we're trying to play.

01:02:59.675 --> 01:03:01.610
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

01:03:01.612 --> 01:03:03.945
Shh, do you hear that?

01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:07.883
- Subway.
- Shh.

01:03:07.885 --> 01:03:10.619
It's Luka's asshole
screaming my name.

01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:15.724
I'm not interested.

01:03:15.726 --> 01:03:17.359
By the way, with two houses.

01:03:17.361 --> 01:03:19.828
- 400, what?
- You owe me $450.

01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:22.297
You guys are fuckin' boring.

01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:24.366
I'm gonna go fuck.

01:03:24.567 --> 01:03:26.902
Do what you do best.

01:03:27.370 --> 01:03:28.904
Six, seven, eight.

01:03:28.906 --> 01:03:31.373
Oh, I think I own that.

01:03:31.375 --> 01:03:35.377
Ah, no, no no no,
I was right here, on chance.

01:03:35.912 --> 01:03:38.814
Do you even
stop fucking things?

01:03:41.918 --> 01:03:43.785
Go, go again.

01:03:45.121 --> 01:03:46.788
Oh, "get out of jail free."

01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:48.190
It's nice.

01:03:48.424 --> 01:03:49.524
Save it.

01:03:49.526 --> 01:03:51.293
- Your turn.
- - Ok.

01:03:52.328 --> 01:03:54.963
Never Luka, never.

01:03:55.765 --> 01:03:56.932
This guy's crazy.

01:03:56.934 --> 01:03:58.433
You're a fucking pig Charlie.

01:03:58.435 --> 01:03:59.701
I never stop Luka.

01:03:59.703 --> 01:04:01.736
One, two, three, four.

01:04:12.114 --> 01:04:15.016
Hi you guys, how you doing?

01:04:15.585 --> 01:04:17.185
Good, ok cool.

01:04:17.187 --> 01:04:21.356
I have a little special
performance for you guys tonight.

01:04:21.358 --> 01:04:23.258
A little song, a little ditty,

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:26.228
an old jazz standard
called, "smile."

01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:30.498
So I hope you enjoy it.

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:15.430
Thank you.

01:07:19.136 --> 01:07:22.404
Thank you so much.

01:07:29.245 --> 01:07:30.478
Oh my god, thank you.

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:31.813
No.

01:07:35.151 --> 01:07:36.684
Ok.

01:07:39.321 --> 01:07:42.424
Not looking, not looking.

01:11:00.055 --> 01:11:01.623
Nightmare.

01:11:05.394 --> 01:11:06.894
You Kim?

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:09.831
Guess the same thing.

01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:14.836
What's going on?

01:11:18.007 --> 01:11:19.874
The bar's closing.

01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:23.478
We can't afford
the rent any more.

01:11:24.546 --> 01:11:27.282
Be turned into fucking
condos or something.

01:11:30.019 --> 01:11:32.687
Be gone in a couple of
weeks, a month maybe.

01:11:34.623 --> 01:11:36.758
Nobody knows.

01:11:55.744 --> 01:11:57.378
It's ok.

01:19:23.158 --> 01:19:26.093
Stop, what's wrong?

01:19:26.528 --> 01:19:29.163
Tell me what's wrong.

01:19:29.865 --> 01:19:32.133
Look at me, look at me!

01:19:33.468 --> 01:19:35.136
What is it?

01:19:41.643 --> 01:19:43.778
Talk to me.

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:46.380
Please.

01:20:08.703 --> 01:20:10.004
Give me the knife.

01:20:10.006 --> 01:20:12.673
Hey baby it's ok.

01:20:12.675 --> 01:20:14.108
Give me the knife.

01:20:14.110 --> 01:20:15.209
Hey you guys I think
he needs to be left alone.

01:20:15.211 --> 01:20:16.744
Let go.

01:20:17.646 --> 01:20:19.246
Come on, look at us.

01:20:19.248 --> 01:20:21.816
Hey, look at me.

01:20:23.084 --> 01:20:25.186
It'll be fine all right.

01:20:26.188 --> 01:20:27.154
All right?

01:20:27.156 --> 01:20:29.523
Hey, you're gonna be fine.

01:20:30.592 --> 01:20:32.226
There's nothing out there.

01:20:32.228 --> 01:20:34.094
No-one's gonna hurt you.

01:20:34.896 --> 01:20:36.497
Thank you.

01:20:41.436 --> 01:20:42.703
Come on,
you're a fuckin' boxer,

01:20:42.705 --> 01:20:44.171
you're all right, come on.

01:20:46.508 --> 01:20:47.675
Charlie he's freaked out.

01:20:47.677 --> 01:20:48.943
I know.

01:20:53.215 --> 01:20:55.316
Give him some space.

01:21:30.318 --> 01:21:33.254
Merde! Merde, I knew it!

01:21:37.125 --> 01:21:38.859
You fucked up!

01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:43.130
What are you looking for?

01:21:43.132 --> 01:21:44.231
Where is it?

01:21:44.233 --> 01:21:45.366
I don't know.

01:21:45.368 --> 01:21:46.734
What knife?

01:21:46.736 --> 01:21:47.935
That little black one
you've been carrying around?

01:21:47.937 --> 01:21:49.536
I need my fucking knife!

01:21:50.138 --> 01:21:52.539
- What are you doing?
- Have you seen his knife?

01:21:52.541 --> 01:21:54.041
No I haven't, honey
calm down, it's ok.

01:21:54.043 --> 01:21:54.975
Who knows, who knows?

01:21:54.977 --> 01:21:56.143
I need it, where is it?

01:21:56.145 --> 01:21:57.578
You do not need a knife.

01:21:57.580 --> 01:22:00.247
You took it,
you took it, who took it?

01:22:00.249 --> 01:22:02.416
No seriously,
seriously, it's ok.

01:22:02.418 --> 01:22:03.684
Where is it?

01:22:03.686 --> 01:22:05.953
Look at me, it's ok,
we love you it's fine.

01:22:05.955 --> 01:22:06.887
I need my knife.

01:22:06.889 --> 01:22:08.455
You don't need a knife.

01:22:09.057 --> 01:22:10.424
- It's gonna be fine.
- - Calm down.

01:22:10.426 --> 01:22:11.592
I need it, I need it!

01:22:11.594 --> 01:22:12.594
You don't need a knife.

01:22:12.595 --> 01:22:13.961
I need the knife, I need it.

01:22:13.963 --> 01:22:15.062
Does he need a knife?

01:22:15.064 --> 01:22:15.863
You don't need a knife.

01:22:15.865 --> 01:22:17.064
I've got a reason to.

01:22:17.066 --> 01:22:18.232
You don't need
a knife, calm down.

01:22:18.234 --> 01:22:20.534
All right, just
chill, all right.

01:22:20.536 --> 01:22:22.236
It's ok baby.

01:22:24.172 --> 01:22:26.941
We told you there's
nothing wrong, all right.

01:22:27.309 --> 01:22:29.810
There is something wrong.

01:22:33.548 --> 01:22:35.082
You're fine ok.

01:25:07.635 --> 01:25:09.670
Please stop.

01:25:19.848 --> 01:25:24.118
Stop, stop it, stop it, stop.

01:27:21.469 --> 01:27:24.738
Don't worry, tomorrow
I'll get a car.

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:28.542
I know a place where no
one will ever find him.

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:02.576
- Luka.
- Yeah?

01:28:05.513 --> 01:28:10.150
Tonight can look at my face.

01:28:37.845 --> 01:28:40.213
I love you, you know that?

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:48.034
My name is Maurice.

01:31:49.303 --> 01:31:51.738
I know I don't really exist.

01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:54.908
I met people who love me.

01:31:54.910 --> 01:31:57.344
I met people I loved.

01:31:57.346 --> 01:32:00.347
But I was only here for a while.

01:32:00.349 --> 01:32:02.849
Just for a little while.
