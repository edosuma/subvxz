00:25.068 --> 00:25.862
Again, left right left.

00:33.586 --> 00:34.379
Ohh.

00:34.413 --> 00:36.103
Ooh, you all
right there Doc?

00:36.137 --> 00:37.068
Mm-hmm.

00:37.103 --> 00:38.689
Yeah, I just put too
much into that burnout.

00:38.724 --> 00:39.758
And now I'm
paying for it.

00:40.448 --> 00:41.793
Yeah, let me
take a look.

00:42.517 --> 00:43.344
Let's see.

00:44.758 --> 00:45.758
Ooh yeah.

00:45.793 --> 00:48.172
You've got some tender
fascia here by the QL.

00:48.206 --> 00:49.000
Mmm.

00:49.965 --> 00:51.551
Yeah, your lats are
pretty inflamed too.

00:51.586 --> 00:52.724
Probably from
all those hooks.

00:52.758 --> 00:53.931
Oh great.

00:53.965 --> 00:55.620
Well maybe my trainer should
have eased me into things.

00:55.655 --> 00:57.827
Oh, I wanted you to see
what Rex and I were up to.

00:57.862 --> 00:59.034
Okay, take a deep
breath for me.

01:00.034 --> 01:01.517
Right there?

01:01.551 --> 01:02.379
No, that's not-

01:02.482 --> 01:03.275
that's not
the right spot.

01:04.862 --> 01:06.068
Is it there?

01:06.586 --> 01:07.241
No.

01:07.275 --> 01:08.000
Lower.

01:08.896 --> 01:10.448
There?

01:10.482 --> 01:11.758
Lower.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.172
Uh-huh.

01:14.206 --> 01:15.724
You think I'm an
easy mark do you?

01:15.758 --> 01:16.413
<i>I hope you are.</i>

01:17.344 --> 01:18.379
<i>You don't
tell me nothing!</i>

01:18.413 --> 01:19.448
Man2: <i>Save it
for the ring!</i>

01:22.068 --> 01:22.793
What is it, pal?

01:28.724 --> 01:29.517
Seriously.

01:29.551 --> 01:31.344
You tell me what
were you thinking.

01:31.379 --> 01:32.103
Huh?

01:33.241 --> 01:34.862
Do you really want to
challenge a fighter like me?

01:34.896 --> 01:36.137
<i>Really?</i>

01:36.172 --> 01:36.965
<i>Huh?</i>

01:37.000 --> 01:38.068
I'm too pretty.

01:38.103 --> 01:39.689
And too fast.

01:39.724 --> 01:40.551
How far's he
going, Rickie?

01:40.586 --> 01:42.034
<i>Oh-ho!</i>

01:42.068 --> 01:43.965
<i>He'll go far.</i>

01:44.000 --> 01:45.586
He'll go down.

01:45.620 --> 01:46.793
All the way
to bumsville.

01:51.137 --> 01:51.793
Whoah!

01:53.517 --> 01:54.172
<i>Huh!</i>

01:55.172 --> 01:56.344
Your dog's about to
catch these hands hey?

01:56.379 --> 01:57.758
That's a fight you
don't want to start.

01:58.896 --> 01:59.655
Lizzie.

02:00.068 --> 02:01.344
Hold your boys back.

02:03.448 --> 02:04.620
All right.

02:04.655 --> 02:05.586
You heard him.

02:05.620 --> 02:06.965
Let's get out
of here, boys.

02:15.482 --> 02:16.896
Who is that?

02:16.931 --> 02:18.344
Oh, that's Lizzie.

02:18.379 --> 02:20.103
Manager of sorts.

02:20.137 --> 02:22.448
<i>Protecting me
just like old days huh?</i>

02:22.482 --> 02:23.517
<i>Huh Charlie?</i>

02:27.034 --> 02:27.931
You guys know
each other?

02:27.965 --> 02:29.413
We go back.

02:30.344 --> 02:31.034
Sarah.

02:31.827 --> 02:33.000
Meet Jack Hudson.

02:34.344 --> 02:36.000
My brother.

02:47.827 --> 02:49.655
So when did
you get here?

02:49.689 --> 02:51.034
<i>Late last night.</i>

02:51.068 --> 02:53.586
<i>I got the call last minute
for a fight tonight.</i>

02:55.068 --> 02:56.103
Hey good to
see you, Rex!

02:56.137 --> 02:58.517
<i>How're you doing buddy?</i>

02:58.551 --> 02:59.655
<i>Ohhh.</i>

03:01.586 --> 03:02.896
<i>How are you doing?</i>

03:02.931 --> 03:04.000
He did a
number on you.

03:04.034 --> 03:04.827
How's your head?

03:04.862 --> 03:06.241
That was a
cheap shot.

03:06.275 --> 03:06.896
<i>Oh, that?</i>

03:06.931 --> 03:08.482
No that was nothing.

03:08.517 --> 03:10.517
Just a show to promote
the fight on social media.

03:11.068 --> 03:11.689
<i>Well-</i>

03:11.724 --> 03:12.517
you should've called.

03:12.551 --> 03:13.758
You want to come
stay at the house?

03:13.793 --> 03:14.862
<i>I got a
motel room.</i>

03:15.689 --> 03:17.034
I didn't want
to impose.

03:18.241 --> 03:19.517
So you train
here too?

03:19.551 --> 03:21.137
Uh no.

03:21.172 --> 03:22.551
First time.

03:22.586 --> 03:24.758
Well I see Charlie here is
punching above his weight.

03:24.793 --> 03:26.344
<i>Yeah, I
have a girlfriend-</i>

03:26.379 --> 03:27.724
who can put up
with the smell here.

03:27.758 --> 03:28.586
So I'm living
the dream.

03:28.620 --> 03:29.620
<i>Right.</i>

03:29.655 --> 03:31.517
Well, I've got to get a
few rounds in myself.

03:31.551 --> 03:33.137
Get the blood pumping.

03:33.172 --> 03:35.586
Maybe one of these tomato
cans'll spar with me.

03:35.620 --> 03:36.758
Well I've got
gloves in my bag.

03:36.793 --> 03:38.000
Maybe we should
go a few rounds.

03:39.931 --> 03:41.931
You think you can go
the distance, old man?

03:41.965 --> 03:42.931
Without breaking a sweat.

03:59.379 --> 04:00.586
<i>Oh you want
some of this?</i>

04:00.620 --> 04:01.310
<i>Huh? Come on.</i>

04:02.655 --> 04:03.241
What you want man?

04:18.137 --> 04:19.965
<i>You're slow cutting
your angles, Charlie.</i>

04:20.000 --> 04:21.689
<i>Keep your hands up
and bob around a bit.</i>

04:21.724 --> 04:23.241
I know my way around
the ring, Jackie boy.

04:23.275 --> 04:24.655
Don't forget I taught you
everything you know.

04:39.689 --> 04:40.827
Ha.

04:40.862 --> 04:42.724
Your moves don't work as
good as you think they do pal.

04:44.068 --> 04:45.448
If you'd used
my shoulder roll-

04:45.482 --> 04:46.793
you might be
champ by now.

05:08.655 --> 05:10.344
Your shoulder roll
just got you laid out-

05:10.379 --> 05:12.000
old man.

05:12.034 --> 05:13.137
Easy pal.

05:14.793 --> 05:16.379
Jack just doesn't know
his own strength.

05:18.379 --> 05:19.103
Hey.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.275
Looking forward to
the fight tonight.

05:22.448 --> 05:23.620
Want to grab
some dinner after?

05:26.379 --> 05:27.586
Maybe.

05:30.241 --> 05:31.758
Are you okay?

05:31.793 --> 05:32.551
<i>Yeah.</i>

05:33.655 --> 05:35.620
Well that was a
bit of a surprise.

05:35.655 --> 05:36.310
What?

05:36.344 --> 05:37.000
Jack's left hook?

05:37.620 --> 05:39.000
No, his visit.

05:39.034 --> 05:41.620
Is it strange that
he didn't call ahead?

05:41.655 --> 05:42.448
Ah, nah.

05:42.482 --> 05:43.689
Jack's not much of
a communicator.

05:43.724 --> 05:44.827
Hey.

05:44.862 --> 05:46.034
<i>When was the
last time you guys-</i>

05:46.068 --> 05:47.000
saw each other?

05:47.724 --> 05:48.862
A couple of years.

05:48.896 --> 05:50.275
Used to be close.

05:50.310 --> 05:51.655
Been hard to
keep in touch.

05:51.689 --> 05:52.344
I tried.

05:52.379 --> 05:53.241
But you know-

05:53.275 --> 05:54.137
Jack does
his own thing.

05:54.172 --> 05:55.068
<i>Well maybe-</i>

05:55.103 --> 05:56.758
this visit can be a
chance to reconnect.

05:56.793 --> 05:58.827
I still remember him
connecting with my jaw.

05:58.862 --> 05:59.586
I'm serious, Charlie.

05:59.620 --> 06:01.758
So am I.

06:01.793 --> 06:03.310
No, okay.

06:03.344 --> 06:04.517
Yeah I hear you,
I hear you.

06:04.551 --> 06:06.137
But let's just see how
tonight goes okay?

06:21.172 --> 06:24.517
I haven't seen a beating this
bad since Apollo and Drago.

06:24.551 --> 06:25.758
Jesse, that's Charlie's brother.

06:25.793 --> 06:26.758
Don't forget!

06:26.793 --> 06:28.724
No, I'm sure he's just
warming up Charlie.

06:28.758 --> 06:30.344
Don't count
him out Jesse.

06:30.896 --> 06:32.275
He's got a
mean left hook.

06:35.586 --> 06:38.034
Is he being
too restrained?

06:38.068 --> 06:39.241
Yeah that's his job
as a journeyman.

06:39.275 --> 06:40.413
He'd better be.

06:40.448 --> 06:42.724
He's here to build up the
record of guys like Rickie.

06:46.310 --> 06:47.620
He's not
here to win.

06:47.655 --> 06:49.586
Which is why he has more
than a hundred losses.

06:49.689 --> 06:52.206
Being a journeyman is
a regular paying job.

06:52.241 --> 06:53.448
You know, he
fights a lot more-

06:53.482 --> 06:55.620
than guys on the
competitive track.

06:55.655 --> 06:57.068
<i>It's an option
taken by boxers-</i>

06:57.103 --> 06:59.068
who lose the drive
to be a champ.

07:12.172 --> 07:12.827
<i>That's it!</i>

07:12.862 --> 07:13.827
That's it!

07:13.862 --> 07:14.517
Ah, come on!

07:14.551 --> 07:15.448
Keep the pressure on!

07:15.482 --> 07:17.413
<i>Yeah lets do it!</i>

07:17.448 --> 07:18.620
Break him down!

07:18.655 --> 07:19.862
I don't like
this sport.

07:19.896 --> 07:21.413
It brings out the
worst in people.

07:24.862 --> 07:26.931
He's really working
on Jack's eye.

07:27.413 --> 07:28.793
Leave it alone, Rickie.

07:28.827 --> 07:30.620
Let me see your
right for a change.

07:45.896 --> 07:46.896
Give them a show.

07:46.931 --> 07:48.068
But don't go
for the eye.

07:48.103 --> 07:48.793
You'll get me sidelined.

08:02.827 --> 08:03.482
<i>The winner!</i>

08:03.517 --> 08:04.758
<i>By technical knockout!</i>

08:04.793 --> 08:05.931
<i>And still undefeated!</i>

08:05.965 --> 08:10.586
<i>Rickie Hitman Morgan!</i>

08:12.896 --> 08:15.000
You're a disgrace
to the sport.

08:20.241 --> 08:21.413
We should take
you to the hospital.

08:21.448 --> 08:23.517
You're going
to need stitches.

08:34.068 --> 08:35.517
<i>That looks better.</i>

08:35.551 --> 08:36.620
Shouldn't have happened.

08:36.655 --> 08:37.758
<i>A technical
knockout due to cuts-</i>

08:37.793 --> 08:39.413
is an automatic
30-day suspension.

08:39.448 --> 08:40.344
Oh.

08:40.379 --> 08:42.172
That's my paycheque.

08:42.206 --> 08:43.931
For a kid who doesn't
understand how this works.

08:44.689 --> 08:46.379
<i>Did you see what
I did to his face?</i>

08:47.241 --> 08:48.448
<i>Huh?</i>

08:48.482 --> 08:49.448
<i>I knew I'd
beat his ass!</i>

08:49.482 --> 08:50.344
<i>But hey papi!</i>

08:50.379 --> 08:51.793
<i>It took a warrior
to break him!</i>

08:57.724 --> 08:58.517
It's okay, Rex.

08:59.379 --> 09:01.034
It's the business.

09:01.068 --> 09:03.241
Why don't you come stay
with me until you get better?

09:03.275 --> 09:04.172
No thanks.

09:05.379 --> 09:07.413
Nothing an ice bath
at the motel can't fix.

09:10.344 --> 09:11.931
Is he going
to be okay?

09:11.965 --> 09:13.896
Yeah, for sure.

09:13.931 --> 09:15.103
He's a professional.

09:15.137 --> 09:16.620
He'll be fine.

09:24.965 --> 09:25.862
<i>Hey.</i>

09:25.896 --> 09:27.896
Did you hear
back from Jack?

09:27.931 --> 09:28.551
No not yet.

09:29.689 --> 09:31.620
His loss probably bothered
us more than it did him.

09:34.344 --> 09:35.000
What is it?

09:36.068 --> 09:38.965
They found a body
at your boxing gym.

09:50.379 --> 09:51.344
You okay?

09:52.724 --> 09:55.310
Yeah, just for a second I
thought it might be Jack.

09:57.413 --> 09:58.275
Hey, Charlie.

09:59.344 --> 10:00.068
Grant.

10:01.241 --> 10:02.413
They said you
found the body.

10:03.241 --> 10:04.137
Yeah.

10:04.172 --> 10:06.068
Still no CCTV
in here?

10:07.103 --> 10:07.931
You know me.

10:09.137 --> 10:11.137
The only camera I got is an
old Kodak point and shoot.

10:11.172 --> 10:13.103
And I can't even buy
film for that anymore.

10:13.137 --> 10:16.413
What was he doing
in here before you?

10:16.448 --> 10:17.413
I gave him
the key.

10:19.103 --> 10:21.068
Lizzie paid extra to have
her fighters come in-

10:21.103 --> 10:22.827
and train after hours.

10:22.862 --> 10:25.862
I sure hope your brother didn't
have anything to do with this.

10:27.310 --> 10:28.793
Landed that
big left hook.

10:28.827 --> 10:31.344
Seen this happen
once before.

10:31.379 --> 10:33.448
Guy got a slow
brain bleed.

10:33.482 --> 10:34.413
Died the next day.

10:34.448 --> 10:35.620
An accident.

10:36.379 --> 10:37.034
Yeah.

10:38.068 --> 10:40.620
But the other fellow
never got over it.

10:54.344 --> 10:55.448
What have
you got pal?

10:58.896 --> 11:01.896
I think Rex believes
this belongs to Rickie.

11:07.172 --> 11:07.931
Good job buddy.

11:09.379 --> 11:10.034
Detective?

11:11.068 --> 11:11.689
<i>Charlie.</i>

11:11.724 --> 11:12.931
What the hell happened?

11:12.965 --> 11:14.448
He was a
strong kid.

11:14.482 --> 11:15.724
<i>We're going to
find out, Lizzie.</i>

11:15.758 --> 11:18.344
Do you know why he would come
back here by himself last night?

11:18.379 --> 11:19.034
I don't know.

11:19.068 --> 11:20.793
Talk to Max,
his cornerman.

11:20.827 --> 11:22.379
They're joined
at the hip.

11:23.241 --> 11:24.172
<i>Hey Max.</i>

11:25.724 --> 11:26.724
You want to
come with me?

11:26.758 --> 11:28.000
I have a few
questions for you.

11:33.034 --> 11:34.000
Based on algor mortis-

11:34.034 --> 11:36.551
I'd say he died between
midnight and 2:00 a.m.

11:36.586 --> 11:37.931
When we initially
reviewed the body-

11:37.965 --> 11:40.448
we wondered if Rickie died
because of the boxing match.

11:40.482 --> 11:41.344
Yeah.

11:41.379 --> 11:43.344
But we found a
second set of bruises.

11:43.379 --> 11:44.344
<i>Broken capillaries-</i>

11:44.379 --> 11:45.724
<i>show damage
to the skin-</i>

11:45.758 --> 11:47.655
consistent with that
of bare knuckle punches.

11:47.689 --> 11:49.448
Wait- are you saying
there was another fight-

11:49.482 --> 11:50.689
outside the ring?

11:50.724 --> 11:52.000
It appears that way.

11:52.034 --> 11:53.655
Okay.

11:53.689 --> 11:55.413
Well I'm going to reconstruct
the rest of the night.

11:55.448 --> 11:56.586
You think you can
keep me posted?

11:56.620 --> 11:57.758
Yeah.

11:57.793 --> 11:58.482
<i>Rex.</i>

12:02.551 --> 12:03.689
You seem unsettled.

12:04.793 --> 12:06.000
Yeah.

12:06.034 --> 12:08.896
That's one
way to put it.

12:08.931 --> 12:11.896
A worry held too close
can't be transformed.

12:11.931 --> 12:13.379
I mean-

12:13.413 --> 12:15.689
I'd be happy to listen
if you want to talk.

12:18.310 --> 12:21.206
A friend is just
having some trouble.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.206
And you know-

12:22.241 --> 12:23.310
I just want
to fix it.

12:23.344 --> 12:24.000
Charlie.

12:25.448 --> 12:27.689
You two have great
energy by the way.

12:27.724 --> 12:28.931
Good pairing.

12:30.793 --> 12:31.517
Oh!

12:31.551 --> 12:33.034
No one is
supposed to know!

12:33.068 --> 12:33.689
Oh!

12:33.724 --> 12:36.034
Im sure they don't.

12:36.068 --> 12:37.620
I'm just really intuitive.

12:38.931 --> 12:39.655
I won't say anything.

12:39.689 --> 12:40.448
I promise.

12:41.413 --> 12:43.241
<i>So uh-</i>

12:43.275 --> 12:45.103
fixing problems
for loved ones-

12:45.137 --> 12:46.241
that can be tricky.

12:47.241 --> 12:49.517
I have some
oracle cards.

12:49.551 --> 12:50.448
Uh-

12:50.482 --> 12:51.379
<i>I find they
help me-</i>

12:51.413 --> 12:52.137
<i>when I'm stuck.</i>

12:53.275 --> 12:54.310
Uh-

12:54.344 --> 12:56.896
Yeah, no thanks Karma.

12:56.931 --> 12:58.103
<i>I'll figure it
out myself.</i>

12:58.137 --> 12:59.241
You sure?

12:59.275 --> 12:59.931
Yeah, thank you.

13:03.034 --> 13:05.655
How long have you been a
part of Lizzie's crew, Max?

13:05.689 --> 13:08.689
Came into her circle around
the same time as Rickie.

13:08.724 --> 13:11.275
I can't believe
he's gone.

13:13.448 --> 13:15.965
I noticed you were his cornerman
at the fight last night.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.620
I wasn't much of
a boxer myself.

13:17.655 --> 13:19.724
Lizzie put me to work
as Rickie's guy.

13:19.758 --> 13:21.724
Cut-man, trainer,
driver, nutritionist.

13:21.758 --> 13:22.413
Anything he needed.

13:23.586 --> 13:24.620
Well last night, Rickie-

13:24.655 --> 13:27.000
he went to the
club after the fight.

13:27.034 --> 13:28.448
<i>Then he back
to the gym?</i>

13:29.034 --> 13:29.689
Yeah.

13:29.724 --> 13:30.517
You drove him?

13:32.137 --> 13:33.103
He didn't
want me to.

13:34.448 --> 13:35.103
Had that argument.

13:35.137 --> 13:35.931
Kind of shook him.

13:36.551 --> 13:37.586
What argument?

13:38.827 --> 13:39.758
No one told you?

13:41.310 --> 13:43.689
Jack Hudson came to
the club after the fight.

13:43.724 --> 13:44.620
All bent
out of shape.

13:45.965 --> 13:47.103
Charlie.

13:47.137 --> 13:47.896
I've got something.

13:55.655 --> 13:57.896
Seems like the last person to
see Rickie alive was my brother.

13:57.931 --> 13:58.724
We know.

13:58.758 --> 14:00.551
Someone posted
this an hour ago.

14:30.724 --> 14:31.586
I'll be back.

14:46.206 --> 14:47.758
How did you know
where to find me?

14:47.793 --> 14:49.827
I figured you'd come
to our old spot.

14:50.793 --> 14:53.068
Listen, I don't need you
hounding me every time I lose.

14:53.103 --> 14:53.862
<i>Okay? I'm fine.</i>

14:53.896 --> 14:54.896
Hound...?

14:56.275 --> 14:57.379
That's not
why I'm here.

14:58.758 --> 14:59.862
Rickie Morgan's dead.

15:01.103 --> 15:02.103
<i>I've got to
take you in.</i>

15:02.137 --> 15:02.758
Okay?

15:02.793 --> 15:04.103
For questioning.

15:07.310 --> 15:08.000
<i>Jack.</i>

15:09.172 --> 15:10.206
<i>Don't even
think about it.</i>

15:11.724 --> 15:12.724
Rex would
take you down.

15:31.241 --> 15:32.689
<i>It's not
what it looks like.</i>

15:32.724 --> 15:34.379
I have no reason
to kill Rickie.

15:35.517 --> 15:37.034
He sidelined you with
that cut above your eye.

15:38.034 --> 15:38.931
You were mad.

15:38.965 --> 15:40.241
I saw it.

15:40.275 --> 15:41.655
<i>If you weren't, why'd you get
back in the ring with him?</i>

15:41.689 --> 15:42.965
Is this my
brother asking?

15:43.000 --> 15:43.758
Or a cop?

15:43.793 --> 15:44.448
Both.

15:44.482 --> 15:45.275
And you know what?

15:45.310 --> 15:46.275
You should be
thankful right now-

15:46.310 --> 15:47.896
that the cop in front
of you is your brother.

15:47.931 --> 15:48.655
<i>Right.</i>

15:48.689 --> 15:50.241
Because you're
in my corner?

15:50.896 --> 15:52.275
I'm always in
your corner Jack.

15:52.310 --> 15:53.172
Come on!

15:53.206 --> 15:54.827
I need you to tell
me the truth now!

15:54.862 --> 15:56.068
No more lies!

15:56.103 --> 15:57.137
I didn't lie.

15:57.172 --> 15:58.241
<i>I told you
about Rickie.</i>

15:58.275 --> 16:00.241
You didn't tell me anything
about the second fight.

16:00.275 --> 16:01.448
I had to think,
all right?

16:01.482 --> 16:03.172
It's not like I know
what side you're on here.

16:03.206 --> 16:05.310
What side I'm on?

16:05.344 --> 16:06.344
You expect me
to mess up!

16:06.379 --> 16:07.448
I don't expect-

16:08.413 --> 16:09.310
What are you
talking about?

16:09.344 --> 16:10.586
<i>I bet you wish-</i>

16:10.620 --> 16:12.241
that you'd made sure that I went
back to the motel last night.

16:12.275 --> 16:13.034
<i>Don't you?</i>

16:13.068 --> 16:14.206
Oh, don't turn
this around, Jack.

16:14.241 --> 16:15.689
You said you
were fine!

16:15.724 --> 16:16.896
Believe what you want-

16:17.310 --> 16:18.655
Detective.

16:21.206 --> 16:21.827
Fine.

16:21.862 --> 16:22.689
You don't
want my help.

16:22.724 --> 16:23.655
Good luck.

16:27.068 --> 16:28.655
<i>You know police can't
interrogate family members.</i>

16:28.689 --> 16:29.896
<i>I told you to
bring him in.</i>

16:29.931 --> 16:31.241
Not to interrogate
him Charlie!

16:32.068 --> 16:33.689
I thought he'd
tell me the truth.

16:33.724 --> 16:36.000
Looks like he got you more
heated than anything else.

16:36.034 --> 16:37.206
He knows how
to push my buttons.

16:39.724 --> 16:40.655
It's all right, pal.

16:40.689 --> 16:42.206
I just need
to calm down.

16:42.241 --> 16:43.758
He may have caused you
to jeopardize the case-

16:43.793 --> 16:44.793
before it even
gets to court.

16:44.827 --> 16:45.482
Joe come on!

16:45.517 --> 16:46.517
<i>No.</i>

16:46.551 --> 16:48.413
I'm taking over the lead
of this investigation.

16:48.448 --> 16:50.241
<i>No more freelancing
from you.</i>

16:50.275 --> 16:51.551
I can't just sit
on my hands.

16:51.586 --> 16:52.241
<i>Good!</i>

16:52.275 --> 16:53.241
Well go find the person-

16:53.275 --> 16:54.586
who videotaped their
little rematch Charlie.

16:54.620 --> 16:56.344
<i>That's the witness
we need to talk to.</i>

16:59.965 --> 17:00.896
Aghhh!

17:05.724 --> 17:06.344
It's okay.

17:06.379 --> 17:07.137
You go.

17:11.689 --> 17:13.206
So I saw your
fight last night.

17:13.310 --> 17:15.620
<i>A lot of those rounds
were really close.</i>

17:15.655 --> 17:17.068
Too bad you
had to hold back.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.551
You ever get used to
that as a journeyman?

17:22.551 --> 17:23.620
Part of the gig.

17:23.655 --> 17:24.620
<i>You are a controlled-</i>

17:24.655 --> 17:25.827
defensive fighter.

17:25.862 --> 17:27.793
You know how to hit a
man without hurting him.

17:27.827 --> 17:29.068
That job takes skill.

17:30.620 --> 17:32.586
You should explain
that part to Charlie.

17:33.793 --> 17:36.517
You know the thing that I
can't quite understand is-

17:36.551 --> 17:38.379
if you aren't attached
to the outcome-

17:39.758 --> 17:42.689
why would you have a rematch
with Rickie last night?

17:48.413 --> 17:49.068
Look.

17:51.689 --> 17:52.931
I was mad
about the cut.

17:54.482 --> 17:55.413
I showed poor judgement.

17:56.655 --> 17:58.137
He messes with
my livelihood.

17:58.172 --> 17:59.758
And then fronts
on social media.

17:59.862 --> 18:01.448
When you were just
trying to do your job.

18:01.482 --> 18:03.137
<i>I'm happy to help the
kid pad his record.</i>

18:03.172 --> 18:05.724
But he needs to show
some basic respect.

18:05.758 --> 18:07.827
<i>So I went down
to the club.</i>

18:07.862 --> 18:09.620
And we exchanged
a few words.

18:09.655 --> 18:10.862
A few words
about what?

18:10.896 --> 18:11.758
<i>Can you believe-</i>

18:11.793 --> 18:13.724
Lizzie hadn't even
told him the deal?

18:13.827 --> 18:16.000
That she had hired
you to give him a win?

18:17.655 --> 18:18.655
So I told him.

18:18.689 --> 18:20.724
<i>And I didn't break
it to him too gently.</i>

18:20.758 --> 18:23.310
He didn't believe he
didn't win on skill.

18:23.344 --> 18:24.793
He wanted to
prove me wrong.

18:26.586 --> 18:28.034
So he challenged you?

18:28.137 --> 18:30.275
One-on-one grudge
match at the gym.

18:30.310 --> 18:31.758
No audience, no points.

18:31.793 --> 18:33.000
So we got
in a cab.

18:33.034 --> 18:34.034
And we went
down to Grant's.

18:34.068 --> 18:35.724
You had to teach
him a lesson.

18:35.758 --> 18:38.172
I just wanted to show him
what type of fighter he was.

18:38.206 --> 18:39.793
<i>He's all sizzle.</i>

18:39.827 --> 18:41.206
He wants to go
after the belt-

18:41.241 --> 18:42.517
the money-making fights.

18:42.551 --> 18:43.793
Sure, shoot your shot.

18:43.827 --> 18:46.862
But show some respect for
the guys who get you there.

18:46.896 --> 18:48.689
Right, so you
didn't hold back.

18:54.310 --> 18:55.517
It was a
fair fight.

18:56.655 --> 18:58.275
When I left, he
was still alive.

19:01.724 --> 19:02.896
Look.

19:02.931 --> 19:04.517
If one of my
punches killed him-

19:06.206 --> 19:07.172
I didn't mean it.

19:14.896 --> 19:15.620
Hey.

19:15.655 --> 19:16.655
I unlocked the
victim's phone.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.103
I'll see what
else I can find.

19:18.137 --> 19:19.103
Yeah, that's great.

19:19.137 --> 19:20.586
Maybe you can help me
verify Jack's statement.

19:20.620 --> 19:21.482
Did he have
an alibi?

19:21.517 --> 19:22.448
Yeah.

19:22.482 --> 19:24.758
Yeah, he said that
he left Rickie alive.

19:24.793 --> 19:26.689
Got back to his
motel at around 12:50.

19:26.724 --> 19:28.965
So if we take
his word for it-

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
and nothing else
comes to light-

19:30.034 --> 19:30.689
maybe-

19:31.620 --> 19:33.068
maybe we get a
manslaughter charge.

19:33.896 --> 19:34.931
Didn't mean
to hurt the guy.

19:35.137 --> 19:36.206
I mean, still-

19:36.241 --> 19:37.655
he'd be looking at a couple
of years in jail though.

19:37.689 --> 19:38.655
Wouldn't he?

19:39.931 --> 19:40.758
Yeah.

19:44.103 --> 19:45.931
No sign of our videographer
witness at the gym.

19:45.965 --> 19:47.793
Are still waiting on
an autopsy report?

19:47.827 --> 19:49.482
We'll get it
soon, I hope.

19:49.517 --> 19:50.310
How's Jack?

19:51.068 --> 19:52.241
Mad at me somehow.

19:52.689 --> 19:53.586
You sure?

19:53.827 --> 19:55.517
Sure he's not
just scared?

19:56.379 --> 19:57.517
Uh-

19:57.551 --> 19:58.758
It's the worst
day of his life.

19:58.793 --> 20:00.586
And he won't even
let me help him.

20:00.620 --> 20:02.068
I'm sorry.

20:02.551 --> 20:03.965
I'm sorry this
is happening.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.034
<i>I just remember-</i>

20:05.068 --> 20:06.862
being so thrilled
when my Mom told me-

20:06.896 --> 20:08.275
that I was going
to have a brother.

20:08.310 --> 20:11.103
And then I used to let him
tag along with me everywhere-

20:11.137 --> 20:12.655
even when he was
too young to keep up.

20:12.689 --> 20:13.344
<i>I just-</i>

20:16.379 --> 20:17.172
We were best friends.

20:17.206 --> 20:18.000
I-

20:20.827 --> 20:23.000
I don't know how
it all changed.

20:24.172 --> 20:24.827
Charlie.

20:25.655 --> 20:26.896
Why don't you just
go talk to him?

20:26.931 --> 20:28.413
<i>Just tell him-</i>

20:28.448 --> 20:29.517
what you told me.

20:35.137 --> 20:36.344
I always say
the wrong thing.

20:39.241 --> 20:40.172
I've got to go.

20:50.206 --> 20:51.344
Hey.

20:52.758 --> 20:55.000
I wanted to check
your dressing.

21:03.310 --> 21:04.482
Do you mind holding
that for me?

21:06.172 --> 21:06.827
Thanks.

21:12.862 --> 21:13.586
Sorry.

21:17.793 --> 21:20.655
Charlie's worried about you.

21:20.689 --> 21:25.137
Not exactly the visit
I expected, either.

21:25.172 --> 21:26.413
How long have you
two been together?

21:26.448 --> 21:27.413
<i>A few months.</i>

21:27.448 --> 21:29.931
Friends before that
for a long time.

21:30.896 --> 21:32.551
Yeah I think I remember
him mentioning you-

21:32.586 --> 21:33.620
to Mom and Dad
one Christmas.

21:35.275 --> 21:36.137
<i>I could tell-</i>

21:36.172 --> 21:36.827
you'd made an impression.

21:37.758 --> 21:40.689
It's nice to be
able to talk about it.

21:40.724 --> 21:42.206
We haven't told
our co-workers.

21:42.241 --> 21:43.482
Rules against
dating at work?

21:43.517 --> 21:45.000
Yeah, I bet Charlie's
a real stickler.

21:46.275 --> 21:48.103
No, it was
me, actually.

21:48.137 --> 21:50.379
I just didn't want it
to be a distraction.

21:50.413 --> 21:51.689
Hmm.

21:51.724 --> 21:53.310
Well I'm sure
Charlie's fine with it.

21:54.344 --> 21:56.620
The job always comes
first for him, right?

21:58.413 --> 21:59.689
He's very dedicated.

22:00.724 --> 22:02.310
It's one of the things
I admire about him.

22:05.689 --> 22:07.827
I'm happy
for you guys.

22:13.620 --> 22:15.655
It obviously bothers them
both that they're not closer.

22:15.931 --> 22:17.103
If it was me
and my sister-

22:17.137 --> 22:19.241
my mother would have locked
us in a room years ago-

22:19.275 --> 22:20.655
to sort
it all out.

22:20.689 --> 22:21.862
Is that what
you want to do?

22:23.965 --> 22:24.586
Yeah.

22:24.620 --> 22:26.000
Charlie would love that.

22:32.862 --> 22:37.172
What do you get out
of these oracle cards?

22:38.172 --> 22:40.034
Is it basically like
going to a psychic?

22:40.068 --> 22:41.379
<i>No not at all.</i>

22:41.413 --> 22:42.931
It's just a
different perspective.

22:44.448 --> 22:45.379
You should try it.

22:45.413 --> 22:47.275
Mmmmm.

22:47.310 --> 22:48.103
<i>But actually, first-</i>

22:49.344 --> 22:51.000
I have some results I think
you're going to want to see.

22:58.344 --> 22:59.655
What am I
looking at here?

22:59.689 --> 23:00.413
There.

23:00.517 --> 23:01.413
<i>On his back.</i>

23:01.448 --> 23:02.896
<i>And at the base
of his skull.</i>

23:02.931 --> 23:04.137
That wasn't
made by a punch.

23:04.172 --> 23:05.896
Tramline bruises caused
by blunt force trauma-

23:05.931 --> 23:06.689
with a cylindrical object.

23:06.724 --> 23:07.379
Here.

23:07.413 --> 23:08.862
<i>A basilar fracture.</i>

23:08.896 --> 23:09.896
That is what
killed him.

23:09.931 --> 23:11.862
Jack may not have
done this at all.

23:19.620 --> 23:20.896
We can say
with certainty-

23:20.931 --> 23:22.758
that the blow to the back of the
head killed Rickie on impact.

23:22.793 --> 23:23.931
And Jack said he
left Rickie alive.

23:23.965 --> 23:24.793
Yeah, that's
what he said.

23:24.827 --> 23:26.448
But I'd prefer confirmation.

23:26.482 --> 23:28.000
Yeah, I might be
able to help with that.

23:28.034 --> 23:29.827
I just found a series of
angry text messages-

23:29.862 --> 23:31.137
on Rickie's phone.

23:31.172 --> 23:32.517
<i>You're never getting
off this rock.</i>

23:33.068 --> 23:34.034
This is from Lizzie!

23:34.068 --> 23:35.068
<i>Yeah and
after the texts-</i>

23:35.103 --> 23:36.275
there was a
FaceTime call.

23:36.310 --> 23:38.172
And this all happened around
the time of Rickie's death.

23:38.206 --> 23:39.655
Jesse, what about
the motel?

23:39.689 --> 23:41.379
CCTV got Jack going into
his room just before one.

23:41.413 --> 23:42.965
And didn't leave for
the rest of the night.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.482
<i>The FaceTime
happened after 1:00 a.m.</i>

23:44.517 --> 23:47.517
Which means that Lizzie saw
Rickie alive after Jack left.

23:47.551 --> 23:48.896
This exonerates Jack?

23:48.931 --> 23:49.655
It does!

23:52.793 --> 23:53.448
Okay!

23:53.482 --> 23:54.172
We cut him loose.

23:54.206 --> 23:55.275
<i>Charlie.</i>

23:55.310 --> 23:56.068
You want the honour?

23:57.655 --> 24:00.034
I'm going to follow up with
Lizzie to confirm the FaceTime.

24:01.137 --> 24:01.965
<i>No there's
no need for that.</i>

24:02.000 --> 24:03.137
I can do that.

24:03.172 --> 24:04.137
<i>Good.</i>

24:04.172 --> 24:05.724
I'm going to chat with
my source at the gym.

24:05.758 --> 24:06.517
<i>Rex.</i>

24:12.206 --> 24:13.172
Charlie, hey hey.

24:13.344 --> 24:14.000
Hey wait.

24:14.758 --> 24:15.793
<i>If you want
to fix this-</i>

24:15.827 --> 24:16.517
with Jack-

24:16.551 --> 24:17.379
this would be
your chance.

24:17.413 --> 24:18.724
<i>I think the best
thing I can do-</i>

24:18.758 --> 24:19.482
for him right now-

24:19.517 --> 24:20.344
is to find
this killer.

24:20.379 --> 24:21.137
Maybe that can wait!

24:21.172 --> 24:22.068
He doesn't
want me to!

24:26.344 --> 24:27.206
Look, can I-

24:27.724 --> 24:29.000
Can I invite
him to dinner?

24:34.000 --> 24:34.655
Sure.

24:36.068 --> 24:37.689
But don't be disappointed
if he says no.

24:39.068 --> 24:39.965
<i>Come on pal.</i>

24:44.862 --> 24:47.137
Any shady dealings
in Lizzie's past?

24:49.827 --> 24:51.931
I don't know if I should be
getting into that, Charlie.

24:51.965 --> 24:52.931
I mean-

24:52.965 --> 24:54.931
she's made donations
to keep this gym afloat.

24:54.965 --> 24:56.137
I appreciate the discretion.

24:56.172 --> 24:57.689
But you know
it's gone too far.

25:01.862 --> 25:03.379
All I know is the
business end of it.

25:04.413 --> 25:05.965
From what
it looks like-

25:06.000 --> 25:07.758
Lizzie's what
you'd call a steer.

25:08.413 --> 25:09.551
She signs naive kids-

25:09.586 --> 25:11.655
to controlling
management contracts-

25:11.689 --> 25:12.793
pads their records-

25:12.827 --> 25:14.241
then sells them
off to investors.

25:15.241 --> 25:16.413
How long have you
known about this?

25:17.827 --> 25:19.413
From what I understand,
it's not illegal.

25:19.448 --> 25:20.103
<i>No.</i>

25:20.137 --> 25:21.413
Predatory, though.

25:22.206 --> 25:23.758
Any of these
kids ever rebel?

25:25.448 --> 25:26.965
This is just
a rumour.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.103
But a few
years back-

25:28.724 --> 25:30.344
one of her fighters
tried to leave.

25:30.931 --> 25:31.586
He got injured.

25:32.793 --> 25:34.344
How?

25:34.379 --> 25:35.448
Rumour has it-

25:35.482 --> 25:37.000
she had his
fingers broken.

25:37.034 --> 25:38.103
He couldn't box anymore.

25:38.137 --> 25:40.482
Brittle hands.

25:40.517 --> 25:41.758
Who was this boxer?

25:44.689 --> 25:45.448
Is that Rickie's gear?

25:49.931 --> 25:50.620
Hey Max.

25:50.655 --> 25:51.965
<i>You mind if
I ask you-</i>

25:52.000 --> 25:53.034
<i>a couple of questions
about Lizzie?</i>

25:55.517 --> 25:56.793
Not much to say.

25:56.827 --> 25:57.827
We have a
great relationship.

25:58.862 --> 26:00.103
Can I just get
the stuff, Grant?

26:00.137 --> 26:01.724
I'll leave you two
alone for a minute.

26:09.448 --> 26:10.551
Were Lizzie and Rickie-

26:10.586 --> 26:12.206
were they getting along?

26:12.241 --> 26:12.896
Far as I know.

26:12.931 --> 26:13.551
Sure.

26:13.586 --> 26:14.241
<i>Really?</i>

26:14.275 --> 26:15.379
Yeah.
- Because I heard-

26:15.413 --> 26:17.655
that he was pretty upset
because she fixed that fight.

26:17.689 --> 26:18.896
He was more mad
at Jack Hudson.

26:28.068 --> 26:29.137
Did Lizzie ever
hurt you, Max?

26:30.482 --> 26:31.517
<i>Because if she
did the same-</i>

26:31.551 --> 26:32.482
to Rickie-

26:32.517 --> 26:33.586
you don't want that
on your conscience.

26:36.862 --> 26:38.965
She's not the type
you'd want to cross.

26:40.137 --> 26:41.206
If you tell me
the truth-

26:42.103 --> 26:42.896
I can help you.

26:50.344 --> 26:51.862
Rickie and I-

26:51.896 --> 26:53.310
were considering
a move to L.A.

26:53.344 --> 26:55.379
A manager there
is interested.

26:55.413 --> 26:57.620
Lizzie may have found out
and felt some type of way.

26:58.724 --> 27:01.551
Well- so what
did Lizzie do?

27:01.758 --> 27:02.827
Did she threaten Rickie?

27:04.413 --> 27:05.586
No.

27:05.620 --> 27:06.448
For him she hustled.

27:06.482 --> 27:07.758
Got him a fight
with Furious George.

27:07.793 --> 27:08.758
Big influencer kid.

27:09.586 --> 27:10.448
Million dollar bout.

27:10.482 --> 27:11.827
It would have put
Rickie on the map.

27:12.862 --> 27:15.413
He still wanted to leave
after she did all that?

27:16.068 --> 27:17.310
I heard she did
worse to you-

27:17.413 --> 27:18.586
<i>for a lot less.</i>

27:20.551 --> 27:22.862
That was just a misunderstanding.

27:22.896 --> 27:24.034
That's all I
can tell you.

27:25.931 --> 27:26.586
Max.

27:28.310 --> 27:29.172
<i>Before you go-</i>

27:31.862 --> 27:33.241
I need one of
Rickie's gloves.

27:37.034 --> 27:38.068
Why are you
yelling at me?

27:38.103 --> 27:38.965
He's your partner.

27:41.034 --> 27:42.379
You mind telling Rex
what you're doing?

27:43.413 --> 27:44.620
He'll know soon enough.

27:45.827 --> 27:46.793
You mind telling me?

27:47.724 --> 27:48.827
I'm playing a hunch.

27:52.275 --> 27:53.034
Okay pal.

27:54.103 --> 27:54.758
Get the scent.

27:56.689 --> 27:57.482
Find it.

28:11.206 --> 28:12.344
What's he got?

28:14.620 --> 28:16.758
Rex just found
the murder weapon.

28:23.758 --> 28:24.896
Am I in
the clear?

28:24.931 --> 28:25.620
<i>Getting there.</i>

28:27.310 --> 28:29.206
Charlie's still
working the case.

28:29.689 --> 28:31.655
Hopefully we'll have
more answers soon.

28:32.724 --> 28:33.379
Oh.

28:33.413 --> 28:35.000
That's a relief.

28:35.034 --> 28:36.241
So can I
leave town?

28:36.275 --> 28:37.000
<i>Yeah.</i>

28:37.034 --> 28:38.000
If you want.

28:38.034 --> 28:40.862
But I was hoping you'd
be staying for a bit.

28:40.896 --> 28:42.482
Charlie and I want to
invite you to dinner.

28:42.517 --> 28:43.413
Really?

28:43.448 --> 28:44.068
Charlie said that?

28:45.275 --> 28:45.965
Yeah!

28:47.103 --> 28:48.620
When did you last have a
home-cooked meal with family?

28:52.068 --> 28:53.103
What time
should I be there?

29:00.482 --> 29:01.655
<i>You got a minute Lizzie?</i>

29:01.689 --> 29:02.586
Leave.

29:04.724 --> 29:05.655
Superintendent?

29:08.827 --> 29:10.689
<i>You'll never make
it off this island.</i>

29:10.724 --> 29:12.586
<i>That's your
message to Rickie-</i>

29:12.620 --> 29:14.827
at 1:05 am.

29:14.862 --> 29:16.689
Is this you threatening your
fighter the night he was killed?

29:19.793 --> 29:21.724
Rickie was upset-

29:22.000 --> 29:24.379
after his fight
with Hudson.

29:24.413 --> 29:25.448
He threatened to leave.

29:25.655 --> 29:27.827
So I told him
the truth.

29:27.862 --> 29:29.379
He won't make it
out there on his own.

29:29.413 --> 29:31.413
Why didn't you tell him
what Hudson's real job was?

29:33.172 --> 29:35.241
I was building the
kid's confidence.

29:35.275 --> 29:37.000
Did he thank you when
you explained it to him?

29:37.793 --> 29:39.275
He listened to reason.

29:39.310 --> 29:40.103
Yeah, we hung up.

29:40.137 --> 29:42.068
And I went back
inside to celebrate.

29:42.103 --> 29:43.482
<i>Did you tell
him the whole story?</i>

29:44.724 --> 29:46.068
<i>Padding wins-</i>

29:46.103 --> 29:48.034
to sell fighters
to investors.

29:48.137 --> 29:49.034
<i>You a
steer, Lizzie?</i>

29:49.068 --> 29:49.965
<i>Taking advantage-</i>

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
of desperate kids
looking for a family?

29:52.103 --> 29:53.965
Advantage?

29:55.068 --> 29:57.758
They should thank me,
along with Jesus-

29:57.793 --> 29:59.655
that I saved them
from themselves.

29:59.689 --> 30:01.793
I am a mentor.

30:01.827 --> 30:02.482
And a businesswomen.

30:02.517 --> 30:03.172
My fighters-

30:03.206 --> 30:05.034
<i>understand that.</i>

30:05.068 --> 30:06.137
If anything-

30:06.172 --> 30:07.379
it was your brother
who did this.

30:07.482 --> 30:08.586
<i>We all saw the video.</i>

30:08.620 --> 30:09.827
But Rickie-

30:09.862 --> 30:11.241
he told you
he wanted out.

30:11.344 --> 30:13.344
Just like Max did
a few years ago-

30:13.379 --> 30:14.862
before you had
his fingers broken.

30:14.896 --> 30:16.413
I gave that
kid everything.

30:16.448 --> 30:18.482
<i>Everything he had.</i>

30:18.517 --> 30:19.172
Fed him.

30:19.206 --> 30:20.310
Taught him to box.

30:21.068 --> 30:22.379
He threatens to leave?

30:22.482 --> 30:23.758
<i>Disrespectful.</i>

30:23.793 --> 30:25.482
I've got a right
to feel betrayed.

30:25.517 --> 30:27.655
Doesn't mean I
had Rickie clipped.

30:28.620 --> 30:29.448
<i>Where did you go-</i>

30:29.482 --> 30:31.034
after your FaceTime
with Rickie?

30:31.068 --> 30:32.344
I was in
the club.

30:32.379 --> 30:33.413
Celebrating.

30:34.793 --> 30:36.103
There's witnesses.

30:44.551 --> 30:49.172
So what does it take to
be a working journeyman?

30:49.206 --> 30:50.034
Well-

30:51.310 --> 30:53.068
you've got to have
a strong chin.

30:53.103 --> 30:54.724
<i>If you have
a glass jaw-</i>

30:54.758 --> 30:56.344
you're going to get
knocked out all the time.

30:56.379 --> 30:57.689
Then you're
just a bum.

30:57.724 --> 30:59.413
And Charlie got
you into boxing?

30:59.448 --> 31:01.103
<i>Something like that.</i>

31:01.137 --> 31:01.896
Yeah.

31:02.931 --> 31:04.413
I used to get knocked
around a bit in school.

31:04.448 --> 31:05.896
I taught him how
to defend himself.

31:05.931 --> 31:07.793
<i>But then I
fell hard and fast-</i>

31:07.827 --> 31:09.068
for the sweet science.

31:09.103 --> 31:10.758
And pretty soon after that,
I was lighting you up.

31:10.793 --> 31:11.896
Wasn't I?

31:11.931 --> 31:13.482
Well, I mean that's because
I taught you everything-

31:13.517 --> 31:14.689
everything you know.

31:15.413 --> 31:16.034
<i>Saw that coming.</i>

31:16.068 --> 31:16.724
Don't forget it.

31:17.482 --> 31:18.448
He loves
to say that.

31:18.482 --> 31:19.241
He tells everyone.

31:19.275 --> 31:20.310
Yeah but the
truth be told-

31:20.344 --> 31:22.344
he was a thing of
beauty in the ring.

31:22.379 --> 31:23.896
He was fast
and loose.

31:23.931 --> 31:26.551
And could've gone far.

31:30.689 --> 31:32.206
What do you
mean by that?

31:38.620 --> 31:39.758
Oh I don't
think he was-

31:39.793 --> 31:40.655
No no no no no.

31:42.034 --> 31:42.689
Charlie's a big boy.

31:42.724 --> 31:43.586
He can speak
for himself.

31:43.620 --> 31:44.310
Can't you?

31:44.413 --> 31:45.620
What did you
mean by that?

31:45.655 --> 31:46.379
Come on, Jack.

31:46.413 --> 31:48.379
I meant it as
a compliment.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.620
You're very talented.

31:50.655 --> 31:52.103
You could have been
more than a journeyman.

31:52.137 --> 31:52.965
Mmmm.

31:54.344 --> 31:55.620
Then why aren't I?

31:56.758 --> 31:57.551
It sounds like-

31:57.586 --> 31:58.344
I don't know Jack.

31:58.379 --> 31:59.758
Why aren't you?

32:06.275 --> 32:06.965
Maybe-

32:08.379 --> 32:10.275
because when the biggest
fight of my career happened-

32:11.689 --> 32:13.275
you bailed on me.

32:15.862 --> 32:16.896
What?

32:19.448 --> 32:20.344
The Underhay card?

32:20.448 --> 32:21.206
Mm-hmm.

32:21.793 --> 32:22.655
I had just made detective.

32:23.724 --> 32:24.689
I got my
first case.

32:24.724 --> 32:26.172
<i>I couldn't just leave.</i>

32:26.206 --> 32:27.965
I apologized for that.

32:28.793 --> 32:31.000
What- you've been hanging
on to this this whole time?

32:31.034 --> 32:32.551
That was the most
important day of my life.

32:32.586 --> 32:33.655
<i>I lost my step-</i>

32:33.689 --> 32:35.206
the minute I walked out
of that locker room.

32:35.241 --> 32:35.931
Jack- hey!

32:35.965 --> 32:37.344
Nobody was
in my corner!

32:38.103 --> 32:40.344
Everybody loses sometimes Jack.

32:40.379 --> 32:41.310
<i>Yeah.</i>

32:41.344 --> 32:42.896
Including my manager
who lost interest in me.

32:42.931 --> 32:43.689
Come on.

32:43.724 --> 32:44.620
<i>So I had
to decide-</i>

32:44.655 --> 32:45.517
where to go
from there.

32:45.551 --> 32:46.620
I chose journeyman-

32:46.655 --> 32:47.896
so that I could
keep fighting.

32:47.931 --> 32:48.655
<i>One fight.</i>

32:48.689 --> 32:49.827
One loss.

32:49.862 --> 32:52.344
And you blame me for everything
that happens afterwards?

32:53.034 --> 32:53.724
<i>That makes sense.</i>

32:53.758 --> 32:56.241
We're upsetting Rex.

32:56.275 --> 32:58.034
You never get tired
of calling me a failure.

32:58.068 --> 33:00.137
<i>But you weren't
there for me.</i>

33:00.172 --> 33:03.206
Well I'm the one here on the
phone that you never pick up.

33:03.241 --> 33:05.931
But you'd rather blame
me for all your mistakes.

33:12.551 --> 33:13.413
Yeah.

33:13.793 --> 33:14.586
Yeah you're right.

33:15.896 --> 33:16.965
It is my fault-

33:17.068 --> 33:18.275
I'm a nobody.

33:19.275 --> 33:19.931
<i>I get it.</i>

33:20.931 --> 33:22.103
<i>But-</i>

33:22.137 --> 33:25.620
you don't have to play the
role of big brother anymore.

33:25.655 --> 33:27.965
<i>I found out years ago
that I'm all on my own.</i>

33:28.000 --> 33:29.344
<i>You're off
the hook pal.</i>

33:31.137 --> 33:31.931
Thank you for dinner.

33:50.137 --> 33:52.068
I've never seen
Charlie this upset.

33:52.103 --> 33:54.034
And I feel like
it's my fault.

33:54.068 --> 33:55.448
I made it worse.

33:57.482 --> 33:59.620
Maybe it calls for
drastic measures.

34:05.206 --> 34:06.103
Mm-hmm.

34:09.172 --> 34:09.931
Okay.

34:11.103 --> 34:13.241
<i>So the card
you select-</i>

34:13.275 --> 34:16.896
focuses your attention on the
meaningful part of the problem.

34:16.931 --> 34:17.862
Now-

34:18.586 --> 34:21.517
let your intuition
guide you to a card.

34:27.551 --> 34:28.655
Ooooh!

34:28.689 --> 34:30.448
<i>The pillar card.</i>

34:30.482 --> 34:31.448
The pillar.

34:31.482 --> 34:35.103
That one represents
stability and support.

34:37.413 --> 34:39.137
Okay.

34:39.172 --> 34:41.862
So Charlie needs
to support Jack?

34:42.482 --> 34:44.172
Only you can know
the true meaning-

34:44.206 --> 34:45.137
and interpretation
of the cards.

34:45.172 --> 34:45.862
Ohhh.

34:47.896 --> 34:50.068
Nancy, we really appreciate
your cooperation.

34:50.103 --> 34:50.862
Um-

34:50.896 --> 34:52.241
If this is about
the gift baskets-

34:52.275 --> 34:53.172
I know nothing.

34:53.586 --> 34:54.241
<i>Gift baskets?</i>

34:54.275 --> 34:55.000
No no no.

34:55.034 --> 34:56.758
We're investigating
a murder.

34:57.862 --> 34:59.068
How can I help?

35:00.965 --> 35:01.965
Um-

35:02.000 --> 35:05.241
I understand that you
were running the valet-

35:05.275 --> 35:06.827
at the Cosmo Club
the night of the 16th.

35:07.724 --> 35:08.620
Do you remember
this car?

35:08.655 --> 35:10.310
<i>Personalized license plate.</i>

35:10.344 --> 35:11.068
MamaBear?

35:11.103 --> 35:12.068
That's Lizzie's car.

35:12.103 --> 35:12.862
Yes.

35:12.896 --> 35:13.896
Yeah, okay.

35:13.931 --> 35:16.517
Any memory of what
time she might have left?

35:16.551 --> 35:18.724
Look, I know you have to
keep track of a bunch of cars.

35:18.758 --> 35:19.896
It was 1:10 in
the morning.

35:20.793 --> 35:21.586
Oh!

35:21.689 --> 35:23.137
That's a-

35:23.172 --> 35:24.689
really good memory.

35:24.724 --> 35:26.344
I remember it special-

35:26.379 --> 35:28.758
because I just came
back from my break.

35:28.793 --> 35:30.758
And Lizzie wasn't
the one driving.

35:33.137 --> 35:34.344
<i>So Bubba.</i>

35:34.379 --> 35:36.551
We have a witness that says that
they saw you leave the club-

35:36.586 --> 35:38.241
right after Lizzie's
chat with Rickie.

35:38.275 --> 35:39.586
<i>Where were you going?</i>

35:41.482 --> 35:42.655
Direct your
questions to me.

35:42.689 --> 35:43.448
<i>Why?</i>

35:43.482 --> 35:45.103
Does he have
something to hide?

35:45.137 --> 35:46.517
Or do not want
him to tell me-

35:46.551 --> 35:49.241
that you sent him
to lean on Rickie?

35:49.275 --> 35:50.310
Things got
out of hand?

35:50.344 --> 35:51.103
You killed him instead?

35:51.137 --> 35:52.137
Wait wait wait.

35:52.172 --> 35:53.379
I never did
any of that.

35:53.413 --> 35:55.241
You didn't swing a metal rod
at the back of Rickie's head?

35:55.275 --> 35:56.068
No!

35:56.103 --> 35:57.137
I never even went
into the gym.

35:58.379 --> 35:59.517
When I got there-

35:59.551 --> 36:00.758
I saw Rickie's
car pull out.

36:00.793 --> 36:02.103
So I followed him.

36:02.965 --> 36:03.586
Where?

36:03.620 --> 36:04.344
<i>I don't know.</i>

36:04.379 --> 36:05.172
I lost his tail.

36:05.206 --> 36:06.620
So I went to the
house and waited up.

36:06.655 --> 36:07.965
But he never
came home.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.344
Until Grant called me from
the gym the next morning-

36:10.379 --> 36:11.551
we thought
he'd taken off.

36:11.586 --> 36:12.241
<i>So-</i>

36:12.275 --> 36:13.896
he didn't listen
to reason-

36:13.931 --> 36:15.103
<i>like you said before?</i>

36:16.310 --> 36:17.965
Look, Jack embarrassed him.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.206
<i>He was on
a rampage.</i>

36:20.241 --> 36:21.655
Yelling at me.

36:21.689 --> 36:22.965
So I made
up a story-

36:23.000 --> 36:25.758
about getting him a fight
with Furious George.

36:25.793 --> 36:28.379
<i>I thought that
would turn his head.</i>

36:28.413 --> 36:30.689
He didn't
fall for it.

36:39.310 --> 36:40.551
When you were
waiting up for Rickie-

36:42.206 --> 36:43.448
did you see Max?

36:44.482 --> 36:45.310
<i>So you think-</i>

36:45.344 --> 36:46.551
Max filmed the
second fight with Jack-

36:46.586 --> 36:47.551
and posted it online?

36:47.586 --> 36:48.862
<i>I think
that he was there.</i>

36:48.896 --> 36:51.586
Lizzie said that she lied during
the FaceTime with Rickie-

36:51.620 --> 36:53.172
about setting up a fight
with Furious George.

36:53.620 --> 36:54.275
Okay?

36:54.310 --> 36:55.137
<i>It was a lie.</i>

36:55.517 --> 36:56.551
She made it up-

36:56.586 --> 36:57.517
<i>on the spot.</i>

36:57.551 --> 36:58.586
And one other
person heard it-

36:58.620 --> 37:00.206
<i>and repeated
it to me.</i>

37:00.241 --> 37:01.000
Max.

37:01.931 --> 37:03.000
<i>So knowing that detail-</i>

37:03.034 --> 37:04.517
places him at the gym
at the time of the murder.

37:05.275 --> 37:06.206
You think
he's our killer?

37:08.655 --> 37:10.551
I don't know
why he'd do it.

37:10.586 --> 37:11.620
I think you
should ask him.

37:30.827 --> 37:31.724
Hey Max.

37:32.758 --> 37:34.344
I need you to come
down to the station.

37:48.896 --> 37:50.482
Let's do this the
easy way shall we?

37:51.758 --> 37:52.413
Rex go!

38:05.448 --> 38:06.137
<i>Ughh!</i>

38:09.413 --> 38:10.241
Okay Max.

38:15.000 --> 38:15.655
<i>Ughh!</i>

38:17.344 --> 38:18.103
<i>Come on.</i>

38:19.862 --> 38:20.482
<i>Hey!</i>

38:20.517 --> 38:21.482
What are you doing?

38:21.517 --> 38:22.931
<i>Get off
of my boy!</i>

38:22.965 --> 38:25.000
Your boy killed Rickie.

38:25.034 --> 38:25.896
What?

38:26.931 --> 38:28.448
He was your brother!

38:30.862 --> 38:33.137
Max what
did you do?

38:36.551 --> 38:37.413
<i>Good job pal.</i>

38:44.620 --> 38:45.655
I didn't kill Rickie.

38:48.172 --> 38:49.379
You had a key
to the gym.

38:51.068 --> 38:52.034
You had information-

38:52.068 --> 38:53.758
that only the witness
who shot that video-

38:53.793 --> 38:54.793
<i>would have had.</i>

38:54.827 --> 38:57.620
<i>And we have
the murder weapon-</i>

38:57.655 --> 38:59.931
with your
fingerprints on it.

39:00.896 --> 39:02.379
One of Grant's
ancient stretching rods.

39:02.413 --> 39:04.344
Must be lots of people's
fingerprints on it.

39:04.379 --> 39:05.689
That's right.

39:05.724 --> 39:07.482
<i>Exactly.</i>

39:07.517 --> 39:08.172
<i>One of Grant's-</i>

39:08.206 --> 39:10.206
ancient stretching rods.

39:11.896 --> 39:14.034
Only the killer and
Rex would know that.

39:18.103 --> 39:18.896
Come on kid.

39:18.931 --> 39:20.172
<i>Tell me what happened.</i>

39:22.586 --> 39:24.000
When I got there-

39:25.620 --> 39:26.551
they were already fighting.

39:26.586 --> 39:27.931
I thought Rickie was
going to pound this guy.

39:27.965 --> 39:29.655
And he'd love to have
a record for his social.

39:30.827 --> 39:32.000
Yeah, it didn't
turn out that way.

39:32.034 --> 39:34.275
Only one more surprised
than me was Rickie.

39:35.655 --> 39:37.517
He must have
been embarrassed.

39:37.551 --> 39:38.793
<i>After Jack left
I came out-</i>

39:38.827 --> 39:40.482
to give Rickie
a hand up.

39:40.517 --> 39:42.586
But I guess he was
mad I saw him get beat.

39:43.206 --> 39:44.551
Told me to
leave him alone.

39:44.586 --> 39:45.724
<i>Yeah but you didn't.</i>

39:45.758 --> 39:47.206
Because you were still there
when he talked to Lizzie.

39:47.241 --> 39:48.172
<i>He told her-</i>

39:48.206 --> 39:49.689
that he that he was
going to Los Angeles.

39:49.724 --> 39:51.517
Getting in his
car that night.

39:51.551 --> 39:52.448
So when
he hung up-

39:52.482 --> 39:53.482
I said, <i>Okay man.</i>

39:54.586 --> 39:55.482
I said, <i>I'm ready.</i>

39:55.517 --> 39:56.206
I said, <i>Let's go.</i>

39:57.103 --> 39:57.896
Mm-hmm.

39:57.931 --> 39:58.758
Called me a leech.

39:58.793 --> 39:59.482
Same as Lizzie.

40:00.310 --> 40:01.482
Said I was going
nowhere with him.

40:03.724 --> 40:05.000
He was going
to abandon you.

40:05.758 --> 40:07.000
That's when I
grabbed the rod.

40:07.655 --> 40:08.344
I didn't-

40:08.379 --> 40:09.896
I didn't
mean to do it.

40:14.689 --> 40:16.344
Yeah but then you-

40:16.379 --> 40:17.896
<i>dragged his body
into the ring.</i>

40:17.931 --> 40:19.379
And you posted
that video-

40:21.206 --> 40:22.724
to make it look
like Jack did it.

40:22.758 --> 40:23.551
<i>I think, like-</i>

40:23.586 --> 40:24.517
if I hadn't
done it-

40:24.551 --> 40:26.103
he probably would
have changed his mind.

40:26.137 --> 40:27.034
You know?

40:27.068 --> 40:28.517
He probably would have
taken me with him.

40:34.896 --> 40:36.172
I love you
too, M .

40:36.206 --> 40:38.896
Oh can you tell B that I'll
be there for his birthday?

40:39.689 --> 40:40.310
Okay!

40:40.344 --> 40:41.000
Great.

40:41.034 --> 40:41.827
Okay, I love you!

40:41.862 --> 40:42.620
Bye!

40:43.724 --> 40:44.793
Our families are
very different.

40:46.379 --> 40:48.862
Which is why I
wanted to apologize.

40:48.896 --> 40:50.862
No no. <i>
- Yeah yeah.</i>

40:50.896 --> 40:51.896
I tried to
fix things-

40:51.931 --> 40:54.482
between you and Jack.

40:54.517 --> 40:55.551
You know?

40:55.689 --> 40:57.896
Confront it head-on like
I would with my sister.

41:00.344 --> 41:01.448
I love that
you tried.

41:04.206 --> 41:05.137
But-

41:06.758 --> 41:07.965
I know you
can fix things-

41:08.000 --> 41:09.689
<i>on your own time-</i>

41:09.724 --> 41:10.931
<i>in your own way.</i>

41:14.620 --> 41:15.275
I'm sorry.

41:34.586 --> 41:36.551
Thanks for
meeting me.

41:36.586 --> 41:37.931
Yeah, I wanted
to let you know-

41:37.965 --> 41:39.344
I got a confession
out of that killer.

41:39.931 --> 41:40.655
Oh yeah?

41:40.689 --> 41:42.586
Is that why you
asked me here?

41:42.620 --> 41:43.275
Talk shop?

41:43.310 --> 41:44.344
Get a pat
on the back?

41:48.000 --> 41:50.482
I came to apologize.

41:50.517 --> 41:53.310
<i>I didn't know how
much it bothered you-</i>

41:53.344 --> 41:55.000
<i>that I wasn't there
for that fight.</i>

41:57.862 --> 41:58.965
And I want
to apologize-

41:59.000 --> 42:01.172
for saying that you should've
been something else.

42:04.379 --> 42:06.586
Well I suppose I wouldn't have
got so bent out of shape-

42:06.620 --> 42:08.413
if you didn't
have a point.

42:09.379 --> 42:10.517
Journeyman is a
respectable career.

42:13.034 --> 42:14.689
Whatever you decide
to do for your career-

42:14.724 --> 42:16.758
I just want you
to be happy.

42:23.620 --> 42:24.586
Yeah.

42:25.793 --> 42:28.172
But I think it's time I try
a different kind of fight.

42:29.275 --> 42:30.379
Olympic trials
are coming up.

42:30.413 --> 42:32.206
<i>I could take
a run at that.</i>

42:32.241 --> 42:33.551
<i>See how far
I can go.</i>

42:33.586 --> 42:35.241
Maybe you could
teach me a few things.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.103
Sorry, I didn't
hear that.

42:39.137 --> 42:40.000
<i>I said maybe-</i>

42:40.034 --> 42:41.172
you could show me
a couple of things.

42:41.517 --> 42:42.344
Yeah, well-

42:43.068 --> 42:43.689
<i>You know what?</i>

42:43.724 --> 42:44.689
<i>How about right now?</i>

42:44.724 --> 42:45.551
Come on.

42:45.965 --> 42:46.586
<i>Ready?</i>

42:46.620 --> 42:47.275
Yeah.

42:47.310 --> 42:47.931
<i>Come on boy.</i>

42:47.965 --> 42:48.931
Think you
can keep up?

42:48.965 --> 42:50.931
<i>♪Left to right

42:50.965 --> 42:52.206

42:53.931 --> 42:55.172

42:56.241 --> 42:57.413
<i>♪You're making me shout</i>

42:59.551 --> 43:00.931
<i>♪Making me shout</i>

43:05.103 --> 43:06.103
Think you can
go the distance-

43:06.137 --> 43:06.862
old man?

43:06.896 --> 43:08.724
Without even
breaking a sweat.
