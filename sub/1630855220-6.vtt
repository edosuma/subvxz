WEBVTT

00:44.280 --> 00:48.200
TURN OF THE TIDE

00:50.320 --> 00:51.560
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS

01:05.680 --> 01:07.480
Where are they sending you back to?

01:09.560 --> 01:10.440
Georgia.

01:11.400 --> 01:12.960
Country, not the state.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.760
Leave anyone behind?

01:18.880 --> 01:20.160
My son and wife.

01:21.360 --> 01:22.880
I got a fish in my cell.

01:24.520 --> 01:27.280
It's called Red.
Couldn't bring it with me.

01:30.720 --> 01:32.840
Are you comparing
a stupid fish to my family?

01:33.520 --> 01:37.120
Of course not.
Your wife and son can make it without you.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.240
But without me, the fish...

01:40.440 --> 01:42.280
Mmm, I don't think it will make it.

01:42.280 --> 01:44.920
<i>You served seven years in jail</i>

01:44.920 --> 01:47.080
<i>for using explosives in a robbery.</i>

01:48.040 --> 01:50.400
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Anything you want to say?

01:51.240 --> 01:52.800
I have been rehabilitated.

01:52.800 --> 01:56.760
I learned my lesson.
I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

01:56.760 --> 01:59.880
Are you quoting
<i>The Shawshank Redemption</i> to me, Mr. Cunha?

02:00.560 --> 02:01.680
It's a beautiful movie.

02:01.680 --> 02:03.800
Yes, but he was innocent and you're not.

02:04.440 --> 02:07.920
- I'm sending you back to your country.
- This is my country, Your Honor.

02:08.640 --> 02:11.480
You were born in Portugal, Mr. Cunha.

02:11.480 --> 02:14.320
That makes this your adopted country,
where you committed a crime.

02:14.320 --> 02:16.040
And did my time for it.

02:16.640 --> 02:19.160
I came here as a baby. I'm fully American.

02:21.200 --> 02:25.120
If you send me back to the Azores,
it'll be like serving a life sentence.

02:26.400 --> 02:27.680
Next!

03:17.000 --> 03:19.040
Eduardo, get over here!

03:25.160 --> 03:28.320
I don't wanna see your girlfriend's
filthy panties in my living room!

03:28.920 --> 03:30.560
Sílvia isn't my girlfriend, okay?

03:30.560 --> 03:34.160
Well, this isn't a goddamn pigsty.
Definitely not a hotel.

03:34.160 --> 03:35.280
One more thing.

03:35.960 --> 03:37.520
This moved since last night.

03:37.520 --> 03:39.640
I haven't touched anything, Uncle Joe.

03:41.400 --> 03:43.320
Be warned, all of you!

03:43.320 --> 03:45.120
No one touches my harpoon. Okay?

03:45.120 --> 03:47.120
Are we talking about your dick
or the harpoon?

03:47.800 --> 03:49.280
This harpoon was used in a film

03:49.280 --> 03:51.440
that Orson Welles shot
right by here in Faial.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.600
- No shit!
- Yes, shit.

03:53.600 --> 03:54.840
Called <i>Barbed Water.</i>

03:54.840 --> 03:57.080
My grandfather's in it,
harpooning a sperm whale.

03:57.080 --> 03:58.320
It's part of our story.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.560
Back when there were still real men
in the Azores.

04:06.320 --> 04:07.600
They're not mine. Hmm?

04:08.320 --> 04:09.360
Um...

04:10.240 --> 04:11.760
Sorry.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.080
Fuck me.

04:19.120 --> 04:21.080
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Don't do that!

04:21.600 --> 04:23.680
- It'll kill him.
- It's just a few crumbs.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.360
- No, no. Bread isn't edible to goldfish.
- Inedible?

04:26.360 --> 04:30.080
Otherwise, they'll inflate like a balloon,
and die. Come on, clean up the mess.

04:30.840 --> 04:33.520
You, come with me.
You have a good enough body to work.

04:34.080 --> 04:36.200
This body does more than that.

04:37.640 --> 04:38.640
Clean this mess.

04:43.320 --> 04:46.880
Mmm. Yo, this chorizo's really good.
Where do you get it?

04:48.240 --> 04:51.600
I make my own chorizo
with a special ingredient.

04:52.200 --> 04:54.160
They're really good.
What do you make them with?

04:54.680 --> 04:55.960
My chickens' shit.

04:57.640 --> 04:58.480
Delicious, right?

05:00.080 --> 05:01.080
What the fuck?

06:27.600 --> 06:28.920
America is that way.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.840
1,900 nautical miles to Boston.

06:42.040 --> 06:44.160
I still can't believe
that Rafael isn't here.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.960
- And that my dad could actually--
- Arruda's not your father.

06:49.920 --> 06:52.880
He's the man who knocked your mother up,
and didn't give a shit about you.

06:56.880 --> 06:59.680
Someday, we'll see
that fucker's coffin passing by us.

07:04.440 --> 07:06.840
Have you ever noticed
you keep looking for solutions?

07:09.200 --> 07:12.280
You don't feel well in Rabo de Peixe,
you want to go to America.

07:12.280 --> 07:15.280
Arruda killed Rafael,
so now he must die for it.

07:18.640 --> 07:20.680
Eduardo, I don't need solutions.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.160
I just need someone who'll listen.

07:27.920 --> 07:29.640
Rafael wasn't just your boyfriend.

07:32.320 --> 07:33.920
He was also my best friend.

07:42.720 --> 07:44.080
And I'll never forget him.

07:51.440 --> 07:53.240
But we have to move on, right?

07:56.560 --> 07:58.800
We all grieve in our own way, you know?

08:12.960 --> 08:16.360
What if the drugs we brought here
aren't a solution, but a problem?

09:25.720 --> 09:26.600
Detective.

09:27.120 --> 09:29.920
Perhaps this will help us
understand what happened here.

09:32.080 --> 09:35.400
We've also collected shell casings
and blood samples up near the lighthouse.

09:36.400 --> 09:37.520
Any witnesses?

09:37.520 --> 09:40.000
No witnesses.
No one's lived here in years.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.640
It's an automated lighthouse.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.200
And the nearest house is about...

09:44.440 --> 09:45.520
a mile from here.

09:46.800 --> 09:49.280
Didn't you say
nothing ever happens in São Miguel?

09:51.680 --> 09:52.920
I guess I was wrong.

09:57.360 --> 09:59.360
I don't want you here much longer, kid.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.480
I was never good as a babysitter.

10:03.920 --> 10:07.720
And I don't know what you've been up to,
but I don't want trouble on my end.

10:10.520 --> 10:12.680
I wanted to talk
about something, Uncle Joe.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.800
Uncle Joe, are you taking
my mom to America?

10:17.800 --> 10:19.400
Eduardo, go to your room.

10:24.320 --> 10:26.200
No need to be so hard on the kid.

10:26.200 --> 10:27.160
He's my son.

10:28.240 --> 10:29.480
He's my family too.

10:30.840 --> 10:32.640
And if you hadn't fled America,

10:32.640 --> 10:35.440
then my sister would be
receiving treatment in a decent hospital,

10:35.440 --> 10:37.480
with real doctors.
Ever thought about that?

10:37.480 --> 10:39.160
I didn't flee America.

10:39.160 --> 10:42.000
I had a family to raise back here.
You wouldn't get it, Joe.

10:47.800 --> 10:49.040
I want to go to America.

10:50.640 --> 10:51.840
Can you help me?

10:51.840 --> 10:55.120
Enough with going to America.
You think you're the only one?

10:56.080 --> 10:58.200
Every day, millions of idiots
around the world

10:58.760 --> 11:00.600
think they can make it there.

11:00.600 --> 11:04.360
The American dream.
It would be funny if it wasn't so stupid.

11:04.360 --> 11:05.600
But why is it stupid?

11:06.560 --> 11:09.560
- You lived there, and so did my dad.
- What's your last name, kid?

11:10.560 --> 11:11.400
Melo.

11:11.400 --> 11:13.240
Okay, that's reason number one.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.400
Portuguese name, puts you
at the bottom of the pyramid.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.760
What pyramid? What are you even--

11:16.760 --> 11:19.280
The pyramid of dicks
who will never make it over there.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.840
I've always considered myself an American.

11:21.840 --> 11:24.480
But my passport says what? "Portuguese."

11:25.400 --> 11:28.080
The game is rigged,
and I was fucked from the start.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.120
So wake the fuck up, for Christ's sake.

12:07.440 --> 12:09.160
Stupid birds.

12:12.600 --> 12:15.200
That's it. That's it!

12:16.280 --> 12:17.200
Go away!

12:19.440 --> 12:20.520
Go away!

12:39.360 --> 12:40.720
I think he might be dead.

12:46.760 --> 12:47.720
Are you okay?

12:57.720 --> 12:59.600
Out of the way!

13:00.120 --> 13:01.080
Move!

13:09.120 --> 13:11.440
He looks like the guy from <i>The Matrix.</i>

13:14.040 --> 13:15.040
Oh, shit!

13:31.200 --> 13:33.120
Okay, I'll wait for him here.

13:34.160 --> 13:35.720
Yes, don't worry.

13:36.600 --> 13:37.680
Bye, darling.

13:40.960 --> 13:43.400
Hey,
what are you doing there, eh?

13:44.040 --> 13:47.560
Listen.
Shall I give you a cigarette? Huh?

13:53.800 --> 13:55.160
Hey, hey!

13:55.760 --> 13:58.520
I wouldn't tell
your mother if I were you.

13:58.520 --> 13:59.640
Shh.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.560
Shut the kid up. I'm gonna lose my mind.

14:03.560 --> 14:05.960
He cries because he's realized
what kind of a man his dad is!

14:05.960 --> 14:06.880
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

14:06.880 --> 14:09.640
- There's no peace and quiet in this house!
- You're a fucking monk now?

14:09.640 --> 14:13.040
Okay, calm down.
Oh! Where are you going?

14:14.760 --> 14:19.640
Mamma mia!
Spaghetti with clams, so good!

14:20.840 --> 14:22.000
Mmm.

14:22.560 --> 14:26.200
You're a magnificent cook,
signora. Magnificent!

14:27.000 --> 14:30.080
Oh! Poor little guy. May I?

14:30.080 --> 14:33.440
Come here.
Poor little guy. Don't cry.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.760
There, there. It's okay.

14:45.480 --> 14:48.320
Family is
the most important thing in a man's life.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.040
You see? He's quiet now.

15:00.640 --> 15:01.680
Can I be the best man?

15:02.400 --> 15:03.240
Huh?

15:03.240 --> 15:05.040
So many years of being romantic confidant,

15:05.040 --> 15:07.120
I think I deserve
to be the best man, right?

15:07.120 --> 15:09.120
- Hmm?
- Rafael deserves respect.

15:10.680 --> 15:12.760
That's all you did
while he was alive, Eduardo.

15:13.840 --> 15:14.800
It's too soon.

15:16.600 --> 15:17.960
Hey there. Where you going?

15:18.680 --> 15:20.200
- The beach.
- Ah.

15:23.120 --> 15:25.520
Just make sure it's not too late, 'kay?

15:28.720 --> 15:31.120
Rafael promised to bring me here

15:31.120 --> 15:32.440
at least twice.

15:33.120 --> 15:36.560
He never cared to know
what I was thinking or was feeling.

15:38.360 --> 15:39.600
What my dreams were.

15:43.160 --> 15:44.800
To him, I was just a trophy.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.680
You're the most amazing woman that I know.

16:05.120 --> 16:06.760
And what other girls do you know?

16:06.760 --> 16:09.280
You've never left Rabo de Peixe. And look.

16:11.320 --> 16:13.800
I'm the only girl around for miles.

16:17.280 --> 16:18.480
I've seen women in movies.

16:21.920 --> 16:24.040
Okay, so if I'm so incredible,

16:24.560 --> 16:26.640
why hasn't anyone ever proposed to me?

16:26.640 --> 16:27.600
Hmm?

16:29.320 --> 16:33.120
You men, you're total cowards.
That's the truth.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.360
Sorry, Joe.

16:43.880 --> 16:45.400
"A Change Is Gonna Come."

16:47.800 --> 16:50.080
It was the first song
I learned to play on the piano.

16:50.080 --> 16:52.880
An advocate of the civil rights
here on the island.

16:54.120 --> 16:57.040
Some pains are from everywhere.
They have no borders, Joe.

16:57.040 --> 16:58.280
Yep.

17:03.600 --> 17:04.440
What are yours?

17:04.440 --> 17:06.840
You don't really care
about my pains, do you?

17:07.440 --> 17:08.800
Let me guess. You're different.

17:09.400 --> 17:10.440
Don't ridicule me.

17:10.440 --> 17:11.480
I'm not.

17:14.880 --> 17:16.400
I've been around, know what I'm saying?

17:16.400 --> 17:19.760
Grew up in the '60s.
Made myself a man in the '70s.

17:20.360 --> 17:21.720
Spent seven years in jail.

17:23.480 --> 17:24.520
I respect who you are.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.080
You know why I keep
this harpoon here in the house?

17:31.160 --> 17:33.280
Because knowing who you are
is as important

17:34.440 --> 17:35.920
as knowing who you're not.

17:38.480 --> 17:39.960
So the question is...

17:42.080 --> 17:44.560
are we gonna sit here like two lame dicks,

17:44.560 --> 17:47.920
or are we going to listen
to some fucking great music, huh?

18:12.720 --> 18:14.920
If I proposed to you right now,
what would you say?

18:16.720 --> 18:18.920
"You're out of your mind."

18:33.280 --> 18:34.920
Third time's the charm.

18:57.160 --> 18:59.640
So she's your girlfriend after all.

19:00.720 --> 19:02.920
Take it easy, all right?

19:03.960 --> 19:05.800
Look. Uncle Joe, look at that!

19:05.800 --> 19:07.080
I already got one.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.120
Here it is.

19:10.120 --> 19:12.640
Right? Huh?

19:13.960 --> 19:18.280
Who you gonna feed with this shit?
Makes no fucking sense. Too much work.

19:18.280 --> 19:21.000
- My technique is way more efficient, okay?
- Let's do it.

19:25.320 --> 19:26.840
Do you have any ketchup?

19:28.040 --> 19:29.240
We don't eat that crap here.

19:29.840 --> 19:31.240
What's ketchup, Uncle Joe?

19:31.240 --> 19:33.920
Mmm. Ketchup is one of the best things
in the world,

19:33.920 --> 19:35.480
but your dad doesn't know it.

19:36.840 --> 19:38.440
Dad, can I taste ketchup?

19:39.960 --> 19:42.240
I'll send you some
when I get back to America, okay?

19:43.400 --> 19:45.280
Don't give him any stupid ideas, please.

19:45.280 --> 19:46.960
It's only ketchup.

19:46.960 --> 19:49.000
I'm not afraid to compete
in America, all right?

19:49.000 --> 19:50.880
- No, that's not it, kid.
- Well, then?

19:53.000 --> 19:53.920
The truth is,

19:54.760 --> 19:57.320
you've dreamed of going to America
since you were a child.

19:58.080 --> 20:00.000
I kind of feel responsible for it.

20:01.640 --> 20:03.640
You know, you never sent
that ketchup you promised.

20:03.640 --> 20:05.640
Well, before I knew it, I was in jail.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.240
Priorities change, right?

20:10.040 --> 20:12.280
- You know your fish, Red?
- Yep.

20:12.280 --> 20:14.240
He's always gonna live in that fishbowl.

20:14.240 --> 20:17.120
Of course.
And he'll be happy. He's a goldfish.

20:17.120 --> 20:19.800
Well, if I stay here,
I'll never be anything.

20:20.560 --> 20:22.480
I'm just a fish stuck in a fishbowl.
You follow?

20:24.400 --> 20:27.440
In America,
you'll be a small fish in a huge pond.

20:28.560 --> 20:31.040
Here, at least,
Red has food and a place to live.

20:33.960 --> 20:35.600
I don't want to go back home.

20:36.280 --> 20:38.000
You don't want to or you can't?

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
You'll need to leave very soon, kid.

20:54.360 --> 20:55.600
They'll come for this.

20:56.200 --> 20:57.200
They always do.

21:08.400 --> 21:09.520
I'm fucking seeing a camel!

21:10.360 --> 21:11.880
Dude, come on, I promise you.

21:11.880 --> 21:14.040
- I'm really seeing a camel.
- Yeah, yeah, me too.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.240
I'm seeing a camel.
Look over there, with ten humps.

21:16.240 --> 21:17.960
Oh, look who's all wasted.

21:17.960 --> 21:20.160
You're the one
who's completely wasted, okay?

21:20.160 --> 21:22.840
And you'll wind up cross-eyed
playing your little <i>Snake</i> game there.

21:22.840 --> 21:24.400
How, like this? Hmm?

21:24.400 --> 21:26.880
Don't I look pretty like this?

21:26.880 --> 21:29.440
It's time to release the prisoner.

21:31.480 --> 21:32.520
Mmm.

21:32.520 --> 21:35.320
Guys, did you know
that the police can use a cell phone

21:35.320 --> 21:36.840
to track a person?

21:38.000 --> 21:40.440
- What are you talking about?
- I saw it once on the news.

21:42.160 --> 21:43.280
Are you serious?

21:43.280 --> 21:46.280
Goodbye, little snake.
I'll miss you so much.

21:57.160 --> 21:59.040
Oh!

22:00.080 --> 22:03.480
Only the stars know
where the fuck we are now!

22:05.200 --> 22:06.560
Whoo!

22:08.880 --> 22:10.000
Hey, hey, hey!

22:10.000 --> 22:11.200
Hey!

22:11.200 --> 22:12.840
I brought the good stuff!

22:13.760 --> 22:16.440
It even puts hair on your chest.

22:16.440 --> 22:17.840
Now, hear me out.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.720
Who wants to blow some shit up?

22:22.920 --> 22:23.840
No.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.960
Fuck, I swear, man. This fucking shit
weighs more than Dolly Parton's tits.

22:29.960 --> 22:32.520
- I wouldn't know about it.
- Come on, push.

22:32.520 --> 22:35.200
Let's go down. Go back. Come on, one, two.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.400
Come on.

22:40.920 --> 22:41.920
All right!

22:48.320 --> 22:49.520
You do the honors.

22:59.040 --> 23:00.120
Whoa!

23:03.120 --> 23:04.280
That was amazing!

23:06.840 --> 23:07.800
Come here!

23:09.200 --> 23:12.280
- Hey, hey, hey! Hold it!
- Sorry, haven't got excited in a minute.

23:12.280 --> 23:14.600
Sorry.

23:14.600 --> 23:18.920
You know what? Come on, kid.
Blowing shit up makes me hungry.

23:38.400 --> 23:40.760
- You sure you don't want to marry me?
- No, never.

23:40.760 --> 23:42.200
- No?
- Mmm.

23:42.200 --> 23:44.760
- Shall we not marry in America?
- Let's not.

23:50.560 --> 23:52.800
I always liked you. You know that, right?

24:28.840 --> 24:30.680
Love makes great music.

24:32.320 --> 24:34.840
But it doesn't always bring
two different worlds together.

24:34.840 --> 24:36.560
That's how I put it.

24:38.200 --> 24:39.800
Tell me about it.

24:40.600 --> 24:43.200
What? Did you also fall in love
with a Black Panther

24:43.200 --> 24:44.200
pursued by the FBI?

24:45.720 --> 24:47.160
No, no, no. Much better!

24:47.760 --> 24:50.120
Now you've got my full attention. Go on.

24:56.200 --> 24:57.960
The priest in Rabo de Peixe.

25:04.040 --> 25:06.280
Don't laugh at my misfortune.

25:07.800 --> 25:08.840
Why "misfortune"?

25:08.840 --> 25:09.920
He's a priest.

25:12.560 --> 25:14.840
I, on the other hand, am... you know.

25:15.360 --> 25:16.680
Uh-huh.

25:17.480 --> 25:19.360
Haven't you just told me
that not even love

25:19.360 --> 25:21.480
can bring two people
from different worlds together?

25:23.840 --> 25:25.360
And what do I know about love?

25:28.560 --> 25:30.680
I live alone on an island...

25:32.440 --> 25:33.920
in the middle of nowhere.

25:36.440 --> 25:39.520
There is one very important thing
that I am sure of.

25:40.560 --> 25:41.600
And that is...

25:42.840 --> 25:43.680
Yes?

25:45.400 --> 25:47.040
- Joe.
- Hmm?

25:47.680 --> 25:51.040
You said, "One very important thing
I'm sure of." What's the answer?

25:53.440 --> 25:54.520
I forgot.

26:49.360 --> 26:50.640
Where is your son?

26:51.600 --> 26:53.000
You know I won't tell you that.

26:54.160 --> 26:55.880
I could let you live.

26:56.960 --> 26:59.520
What kind of father
wants to survive his son?

27:05.960 --> 27:06.960
I'm ready.

27:10.200 --> 27:11.360
So am I.

27:31.840 --> 27:33.400
<i>I can hear your heart.</i>

27:36.280 --> 27:37.800
<i>But I don't know what it says.</i>

27:42.760 --> 27:44.120
<i>It said the same thing.</i>

27:45.280 --> 27:46.360
<i>For years.</i>

27:51.160 --> 27:52.760
<i>I'm not talking about us.</i>

27:53.800 --> 27:55.280
<i>I'm talking about you</i>.

27:56.880 --> 27:59.880
<i>At school, the guys used to say
that you were the Submarine.</i>

28:01.240 --> 28:02.800
<i>Like that was a good thing.</i>

28:03.640 --> 28:05.440
<i>But I'm not so sure it is.</i>

28:07.920 --> 28:09.400
<i>As if you were always hiding...</i>

28:10.840 --> 28:11.960
<i>or running away.</i>

28:12.960 --> 28:14.600
<i>As if you were never really here.</i>

28:14.600 --> 28:15.840
<i>Don't run away.</i>

28:17.040 --> 28:19.440
<i>I'll give you something
that'll be just yours.</i>

28:20.160 --> 28:21.400
<i>Something real.</i>

28:23.560 --> 28:26.800
<i>My mother,
she didn't want me to see her like that.</i>

28:28.520 --> 28:29.920
<i>So I hid under her bed.</i>

28:32.560 --> 28:35.320
<i>I don't know.
It was like-- like I could protect her.</i>

28:37.240 --> 28:38.400
<i>On the night she died,</i>

28:39.200 --> 28:42.560
<i>she told my father that I could sleep
beside her on the bed.</i>

28:46.600 --> 28:47.840
<i>I didn't open my eyes.</i>

28:49.800 --> 28:51.160
It still haunts me.

28:51.160 --> 28:52.080
I mean...

28:55.600 --> 28:57.520
I should have kept my eyes open.

29:00.480 --> 29:02.200
I should have looked at my mother.

29:04.160 --> 29:05.840
To see her for the last time.

29:37.080 --> 29:39.760
Detective, come take a look at something.

29:44.800 --> 29:47.320
These are pricey shoes
for a fisherman from Rabo de Peixe.

29:52.960 --> 29:56.160
No one knows where Eduardo is,
and his friends are also missing.

29:57.200 --> 29:59.600
Well, they must have run
like hell.

30:00.880 --> 30:04.720
Perhaps Detective Banha
knows their whereabouts. No?

30:09.160 --> 30:10.880
I told you. I barely know them.

30:11.480 --> 30:12.520
Mm-hmm.

30:17.600 --> 30:18.560
Look, Bruna.

30:19.200 --> 30:21.560
I really believe
you don't know where they are.

30:22.800 --> 30:25.000
But I'm also sure
you have some information.

30:26.120 --> 30:27.800
Cooperation will help.

30:30.640 --> 30:33.240
You want my help
to arrest some kids from Rabo de Peixe?

30:35.600 --> 30:38.320
I'm gonna tell you something
I learned since I got here.

30:41.280 --> 30:43.080
What did you bring my daughter in for?

30:44.040 --> 30:46.520
- We're just going over some things.
- Not anymore, Frias.

30:46.520 --> 30:47.480
Let's go, Bruna.

31:23.480 --> 31:25.200
Where is Francesco Bonino?

31:56.240 --> 31:57.480
- Good morning!
- Mmm.

31:59.200 --> 32:02.080
Joe, how are you so fresh
after what you drank yesterday?

32:02.080 --> 32:03.640
I'm a real man.

32:04.560 --> 32:07.080
You know what's good for a hangover?
Fried liver.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.640
I swear by everything sacred,
I'll never touch another drop of alcohol.

32:13.640 --> 32:16.920
Yeah, I've heard that one before.
Now, will you go get my mail?

32:17.680 --> 32:19.120
Box 36.

32:53.240 --> 32:56.040
Where the hell are you, you little shit?
I'm worried sick.

32:57.240 --> 32:59.840
You're right. I'm sorry, Mom.
Don't worry, everything's fine.

33:03.520 --> 33:05.720
I should smack you across the face
with a parakeet.

33:05.720 --> 33:08.280
Either you tell me where you are,
or your birds are gonna starve.

33:13.080 --> 33:14.480
Something terrible happened.

33:28.800 --> 33:29.640
Eduardo.

33:32.200 --> 33:33.440
We need to talk.

33:36.400 --> 33:38.640
- I need to go to Rabo de Peixe!
- Eduardo, wait!

33:38.640 --> 33:40.560
- You can't go back--
- Don't you get it?

33:40.560 --> 33:42.920
- I have to go back to bury my father!
- I didn't bury Rafael.

33:42.920 --> 33:44.920
I don't even know
where his body is, and I'm here.

33:44.920 --> 33:46.640
Eduardo, Sílvia's right.
You can't go back.

33:46.640 --> 33:50.320
All you're gonna do is fuck up the plan.
I told your father I'd help you,

33:50.320 --> 33:51.960
and that's what I'm gonna do.

33:52.440 --> 33:54.080
- What plan?
- America.

33:54.080 --> 33:55.680
Isn't that what you all want?

33:55.680 --> 33:57.840
What plan
is he talking about?

33:57.840 --> 34:00.640
It doesn't matter anymore, Sílvia,
because as of now, the fucking--

34:00.640 --> 34:03.720
Until you're far away, there won't
be peace, with or without cocaine.

34:03.720 --> 34:05.560
Your father didn't just die of old age.

34:06.320 --> 34:09.320
I know that. And that's why
I'm gonna kill the motherfucker.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.320
- Eduardo!
- Kid!

34:11.320 --> 34:12.560
Kid!

34:13.640 --> 34:15.240
Where do you think you're going?

34:18.400 --> 34:20.080
Leave me the fuck alone!

34:24.880 --> 34:25.800
They're the Mafia.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.400
You don't kill them. They kill you.

34:30.240 --> 34:33.200
I'm gonna help you,
but I need you to calm the fuck down!

34:33.800 --> 34:34.680
Do you hear?

34:38.760 --> 34:39.640
Attaboy.

35:02.840 --> 35:05.880
Hello, my little ones.

35:05.880 --> 35:09.400
Come on. All right, all right,
let's calm down. Let's calm down.

35:09.400 --> 35:11.680
Come on, come on.

35:11.680 --> 35:13.360
Such a good boy.

35:18.640 --> 35:19.720
Come back here!

35:20.680 --> 35:21.880
Oh, no. Shit.

35:22.800 --> 35:25.520
Come on, little bird,
come back here. Come eat.

35:26.360 --> 35:27.200
Oh.

35:27.200 --> 35:30.440
Hello, little bird. Come on.
Eat something, my little bird.

35:30.440 --> 35:31.680
Look here.

35:31.680 --> 35:34.080
Look here, eat it. Okay, go ahead, eat.

35:45.600 --> 35:46.640
How weird.

35:47.680 --> 35:48.720
I never...

35:49.960 --> 35:52.200
thought these little birds would be...

35:53.440 --> 35:54.760
so easy to break.

36:03.040 --> 36:05.080
Eduardo!

36:05.080 --> 36:06.080
Did you hear that?

36:06.640 --> 36:08.480
- And so it begins.
- What's happening?

36:08.480 --> 36:10.080
Go and cover Red's fishbowl.

36:10.080 --> 36:12.640
Eduardo!

36:20.440 --> 36:23.920
We actually have
two ways to settle this, fuckers!

36:23.920 --> 36:25.200
Go, go.

36:25.720 --> 36:26.880
The first one,

36:26.880 --> 36:29.880
now you give me
the shit that is rightfully mine,

36:30.680 --> 36:32.480
and I leave this place in peace.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.160
Or go with the second option--

36:39.360 --> 36:40.760
Who's this asshole?

36:41.320 --> 36:44.480
I'm option number two, motherfucker!

36:45.080 --> 36:46.320
Oh, if it isn't Wednesday.

36:46.320 --> 36:48.920
But there's a third option,
you fucking piece of shit.

36:48.920 --> 36:51.360
You take your stooges
and get the fuck out of here.

36:51.960 --> 36:53.880
The drugs aren't yours and never were.

36:54.960 --> 36:55.840
Oh!

36:56.440 --> 36:58.600
Hello, you sly little girl.

36:59.760 --> 37:00.880
You really had me going, huh?

37:00.880 --> 37:03.680
And you were the weakest
of them all, fucker.

37:04.280 --> 37:06.280
At least Rafael had balls,
you know, you little shit?

37:06.280 --> 37:07.560
And you killed him, you fucker!

37:07.560 --> 37:09.760
No, you're the reason Rafael's dead!

37:09.760 --> 37:12.080
Come on, get inside now! Come on!

37:12.080 --> 37:13.120
Go, go! Come on!

37:14.440 --> 37:15.520
Stay down, stay down!

37:15.520 --> 37:17.920
Get the fuck in there, for fuck's sake!
Get in there, go!

37:21.840 --> 37:23.440
Get the fuck inside, come on!

37:23.440 --> 37:25.400
Ah, for fuck's sake!

37:25.400 --> 37:26.640
Go, go!

37:40.800 --> 37:43.200
What are you waiting for?
You can go in now, asshole! Come on!

37:43.200 --> 37:44.200
Go, go!

37:45.560 --> 37:48.040
That filthy motherfucker!

37:54.320 --> 37:55.440
Fuck!

38:06.480 --> 38:08.280
You motherfuckers!

38:20.360 --> 38:21.640
Where are the fucking drugs?

38:21.640 --> 38:24.440
Huh? I'll blow your fucking head off,
do you understand?

38:24.440 --> 38:26.160
Where are the fucking drugs?

38:26.160 --> 38:27.680
- Answer me!
- Let him fucking go.

38:32.920 --> 38:35.480
Hey, you have to be careful
with that shit. That's not a BB gun.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.560
- It's got one hell of a kick.
- Get out of here!

38:37.560 --> 38:38.600
Please. Look.

38:40.560 --> 38:41.400
Zinha.

38:41.400 --> 38:44.000
Because of the fucking cocaine,
you almost died.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.520
Who was by your side?
Who took care of you?

38:48.120 --> 38:48.960
Your father.

38:49.880 --> 38:53.640
I took care of you.
Baby girl, tell me where the drugs are.

38:55.640 --> 38:57.280
And we'll go home, you and I.

38:57.280 --> 38:58.400
I'm your father.

38:59.040 --> 39:00.280
And you're my daughter.

39:01.520 --> 39:02.760
All can be forgiven.

39:03.400 --> 39:05.480
Huh? All right, Zinha?

39:05.480 --> 39:06.680
"Zinha," fucking shit!

39:08.240 --> 39:10.160
You fucking traitor!

39:10.160 --> 39:13.040
You want to kill your fucking father?
What's wrong with you?

39:13.040 --> 39:14.960
You traitor!

39:18.840 --> 39:20.120
You fucking traitor!

39:22.040 --> 39:23.440
Fuck...

39:29.240 --> 39:31.720
Fuck.

39:44.360 --> 39:45.720
It was you or him, kid.

39:46.760 --> 39:48.160
I'm glad it was him.

40:04.080 --> 40:05.280
What's next?

40:10.840 --> 40:12.160
We're lucky to be alive.

40:18.880 --> 40:20.640
There's no excuse for what I did.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.400
But at least we got justice.

40:30.920 --> 40:33.920
For Rafael
and for all the fucked up shit Arruda did.

40:47.400 --> 40:49.680
Neither of us have
a clear conscience anymore.

40:57.480 --> 41:01.280
No one forced us
to keep the drugs, that was our decision.

41:10.560 --> 41:11.400
Eduardo.

41:20.320 --> 41:21.720
We chose this path.

41:26.160 --> 41:27.080
No.

41:29.360 --> 41:30.600
It's not that simple.

41:34.120 --> 41:36.240
Sometimes you gotta get your hands dirty.

41:44.560 --> 41:48.000
I mean, it wasn't just Arruda
who died today.

41:50.880 --> 41:53.560
I'm gonna have to carry his death
for the rest of my life.

41:55.720 --> 41:56.600
I know.

42:21.160 --> 42:23.360
Never let the dead
take their gold to the grave.

42:23.360 --> 42:24.760
They won't need it.

42:25.920 --> 42:27.880
You learn a lot when you're in the can.

42:28.840 --> 42:30.320
I should make you a list.

42:31.200 --> 42:34.080
Because you'll probably end up in jail.
Or killed.

42:34.600 --> 42:36.880
You're not in prison or dead, all right?

42:37.720 --> 42:39.440
This is a prison by the ocean.

42:40.720 --> 42:42.320
Or a cemetery for the living.

42:43.480 --> 42:45.320
I won't get locked up or buried.

42:46.360 --> 42:49.080
We had a plan, and if we follow it,
everything will be all right.

42:49.600 --> 42:51.360
- What about your girlfriend?
- She's not my--

42:51.360 --> 42:53.760
What about your fucking girlfriend?

42:57.880 --> 43:00.000
She wants to get rid of the coke
and get out of here.

43:01.880 --> 43:03.560
That's just fucking stupid.

43:03.560 --> 43:06.840
You do that, and your life
will be exactly like your father's--

43:06.840 --> 43:10.400
Then what the fuck am I supposed to do?
Just tell me, please!

43:11.040 --> 43:13.240
I go, I end up like you.
I stay, I end up like my father.

43:13.240 --> 43:15.120
What's the right choice? Just tell me!

43:17.640 --> 43:19.320
There's no right choice.

43:20.400 --> 43:22.160
You can go back to Rabo de Peixe

43:22.160 --> 43:24.720
and be a small fish
in a small pond all your life.

43:25.600 --> 43:28.840
Or you can take a leap of faith
and risk getting caught or killed.

43:31.400 --> 43:32.280
Listen, kid.

43:34.480 --> 43:36.680
You and I,
we were cut from the same cloth.

43:37.520 --> 43:40.240
We didn't come to this world
to live boring lives.

43:41.400 --> 43:43.800
It all comes down to this.

43:43.800 --> 43:46.440
Get busy living or get busy dying.

43:48.120 --> 43:50.160
So let's get fucking busy already.

43:50.160 --> 43:52.000
I'll get you to America.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.160
But I want my cut.

43:53.800 --> 43:55.800
Of course you do.

46:19.640 --> 46:21.240
