WEBVTT

00:02.293 --> 00:04.212
- Hey, Steph,
I have a joke for you.

00:04.295 --> 00:06.047
Knock-knock.
- Who's there?

00:06.131 --> 00:08.048
- Not me 'cause I'm headed
to Liberty Fun Park

00:08.132 --> 00:10.051
to ride the new "Monster
Machine" rollercoaster.

00:10.135 --> 00:11.761
- Oh, I have one, too.
Knock-knock.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.263
- Who's there?
- Get outta my face, boy.

00:13.346 --> 00:16.265
You're not going
until your birthday.

00:16.349 --> 00:18.101
- Hi! Hi! Hi!

00:18.184 --> 00:20.103
- Grandma Maggie, knock-knock.
- Beat it!

00:20.186 --> 00:23.815
I'm not takin' you
to that rollercoaster!

00:23.898 --> 00:26.860
- No one in this family
appreciates a well-crafted joke.

00:29.696 --> 00:32.115
- Hey, babe, I just got called
in for an emergency consult.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.950
You'll have to take Aaron

00:34.033 --> 00:35.827
to Randy's pool party
this afternoon.

00:35.910 --> 00:37.287
- Oh, but I can't.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.247
I don't have a swimsuit--
or goggles.

00:39.330 --> 00:41.124
You want my eyes all
burny, Charlie?

00:41.207 --> 00:42.917
- You don't have to
get in the water.

00:43.001 --> 00:44.794
Most parents just sit
around the pool

00:44.878 --> 00:47.839
drinking secret margaritas
out of juice boxes.

00:47.922 --> 00:49.299
- That sounds complicated.

00:49.382 --> 00:50.925
But I'm willing to learn.

00:51.009 --> 00:57.307
- Well, count me in 'cause
I am all for adult education.

00:57.390 --> 01:00.477
Plus, I've been lookin' for
a free pool for a while.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.520
- Don't you have a pool
at your condo?

01:02.604 --> 01:06.441
- I'm not allowed.

01:06.524 --> 01:09.611
It was an incident.

01:09.694 --> 01:12.155
- Okay, so, I'll go
to my consult,

01:12.238 --> 01:13.656
you'll go to the party.
[kissing]

01:13.740 --> 01:15.533
And you...

01:15.617 --> 01:17.327
do not!

01:20.038 --> 01:22.499
- Your husband still
does not know

01:22.582 --> 01:25.627
that you are afraid of pools.
- I am not afraid of pools.

01:25.710 --> 01:29.339
I am afraid of drowning
in pools, thanks to you.

01:29.422 --> 01:31.132
- How's this my fault?

01:31.216 --> 01:32.258
I gave you a swimming lesson.

01:32.342 --> 01:33.676
- Ha! You threw me
in the deep end

01:33.760 --> 01:38.264
and yelled "There's
a shark in the pool! Swim!"

01:38.348 --> 01:41.935
- Your survival instinct
was supposed to kick in.

01:42.018 --> 01:45.897
- It did. I survived by never
going back into a pool.

01:45.980 --> 01:47.607
Mom, Charlie doesn't
need to know

01:47.690 --> 01:49.400
every little thing about me.

01:49.484 --> 01:51.945
He doesn't need to know
I accidentally voted for Bush

01:52.028 --> 01:54.197
and he doesn't need
to know this.

02:26.646 --> 02:29.649
- On land?
- No.

02:29.732 --> 02:31.818
{\an8}- Pass.

02:31.901 --> 02:34.028
{\an8}- But you've been sitting
here the whole party.

02:34.112 --> 02:37.574
{\an8}- I told some moms
I'd watch their purses.

02:37.657 --> 02:41.202
{\an8}Randy's brother
looks a little shady.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.997
{\an8}- Well, will you come
watch me belly flop?

02:44.080 --> 02:45.707
{\an8}- Okay, but to be safe,

02:45.790 --> 02:46.916
{\an8}try to land next to
Randy's dad.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.836
{\an8}After his very
enthusiastic hello kiss,

02:49.919 --> 02:52.338
{\an8}I know he's got a great
set of CPR lungs.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.099
[shrieking]

03:04.017 --> 03:08.479
Ah! I'm drowning!

03:08.563 --> 03:10.064
{\an8}- Steph, stand up.

03:10.148 --> 03:12.317
{\an8}It's only three feet deep!

03:19.741 --> 03:22.702
{\an8}- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

03:22.785 --> 03:25.330
{\an8}Thanks for covering
with Aaron today.

03:25.413 --> 03:27.498
{\an8}[kissing] How'd it go?
- Fine.

03:27.582 --> 03:30.084
{\an8}- Yeah, if you wore that,
I bet you turned some heads.

03:30.168 --> 03:34.589
{\an8}- Yeah, I definitely
gave them something to look at.

03:34.672 --> 03:38.051
{\an8}There was even
some picture taking.

03:38.134 --> 03:40.178
{\an8}- Hey, Steph,
what's for dinner?

03:40.261 --> 03:42.430
{\an8}- Chicken, broccoli
and mashed potatoes.

03:42.513 --> 03:43.932
- Mm, sounds good.

03:44.015 --> 03:46.434
But I really hope the broccoli's
not swimming in cheese.

03:48.519 --> 03:52.357
- And the mashed potatoes
aren't drowning in gravy.

03:52.440 --> 03:56.027
- Or the chicken's
not too crispy.

03:58.446 --> 04:01.616
Yeah, I'm not sure
what we're doing.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.118
- Whoa, what are you
guys talking about?

04:04.202 --> 04:06.371
- Stephanie almost drowned
at the pool party.

04:06.454 --> 04:07.830
- GABBY: Mm-hm.
- What?

04:07.914 --> 04:08.957
- She can't swim.

04:09.040 --> 04:13.419
- You're a grown woman.
What else can't you do?

04:13.503 --> 04:15.880
- Well...

04:15.964 --> 04:18.007
- All right, that's enough.
Everybody go, go, go.

04:19.884 --> 04:22.011
Not you.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.472
Why didn't you tell me
you can't swim?

04:24.555 --> 04:26.516
What were you gonna do
if Aaron got into trouble?

04:26.599 --> 04:27.642
- What any other responsible
parent would do--

04:27.725 --> 04:31.187
scream for help.

04:31.270 --> 04:33.481
- Stephanie,
this is serious.

04:33.564 --> 04:35.650
For your safety, you've gotta
take swimming lessons.

04:35.733 --> 04:37.110
- For your safety--

04:37.193 --> 04:39.445
you'd better drop this.

04:40.863 --> 04:44.701
- Stephanie, we'd like to
apologize for laughing at you.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.703
- So you can't swim?
So what?

04:46.786 --> 04:48.788
- Yeah, it's cool, Stephanie.

04:48.871 --> 04:50.248
- Thanks, guys.

04:50.331 --> 04:52.125
- But in case it
rains tomorrow,

04:52.208 --> 04:54.002
you might want
these floaties.

04:54.085 --> 04:54.919
- Or in case you drive
through a car wash.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.379
- GABBY & JAMES: [laughing]

04:56.462 --> 05:00.842
- Or in case we get stuck
in an elevator. Ha. Ha. Ha.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.723
Still not sure what
we're doing here.

05:12.186 --> 05:12.979
- Well...

05:13.062 --> 05:16.274
- Hey!
- I did it! Ha! Ha! Ha!

05:16.357 --> 05:18.151
I graduated from
my swim class.

05:18.234 --> 05:21.946
And according to the rec center,
I am officially a "Barracuda."

05:22.030 --> 05:24.407
- That's great, honey.
I'm proud of you.

05:24.490 --> 05:25.742
- Way to go, Steph.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.618
- And now that I've looked
my fear in the face,

05:27.702 --> 05:30.455
I wanna help all of you
conquer yours--

05:30.538 --> 05:32.248
like James' fear of clowns.

05:32.331 --> 05:33.541
- Like whose fear of what?

05:33.624 --> 05:36.002
Oh, unh-unh, move on,
move along.

05:36.085 --> 05:39.213
- Guys, Stephanie
just overcame

05:39.297 --> 05:41.424
a really big obstacle
in her life.

05:41.507 --> 05:42.967
If she wants to help you do
the same, you should let her.

05:43.051 --> 05:45.803
- Aw, thanks, Charlie.
- Mm-hm.

05:45.887 --> 05:48.556
- And what are you afraid of?
- Huh? Me?

05:48.639 --> 05:50.391
Uh, why are we on me?

05:50.475 --> 05:52.268
You usually do
this with the kids.

05:52.351 --> 05:55.146
- [laughs]
Come on, Charlie.

05:55.229 --> 05:56.272
- Uh, fine!

05:56.355 --> 05:59.859
Uh, for a while there,
I was afraid of dying alone.

05:59.942 --> 06:05.156
But then I met you
and that fear went away.

06:05.239 --> 06:07.408
- Aw, that's so sweet.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.494
Look at my man
lovin' on me.

06:09.577 --> 06:11.204
- STEPH & CHARLIE:
[laughing]

06:11.287 --> 06:14.040
- Okay, Gabby, what is
your most crippling fear?

06:14.123 --> 06:16.626
- Okay, I haven't really
told anybody this,

06:16.709 --> 06:20.546
but I'm really, really
afraid of...

06:20.630 --> 06:22.757
insects.
- Insects?

06:22.840 --> 06:25.718
How could you be
afraid of insects?

06:25.802 --> 06:27.595
They're man's best friend.

06:27.678 --> 06:29.555
- No, a dog is man's
best friend.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.182
- Really, Gabby?

06:31.265 --> 06:35.019
Have you ever seen
a dog walk up a wall?

06:35.103 --> 06:37.063
Can a dog spin a web?

06:37.146 --> 06:41.692
Are there eight dogs
in my pocket right now?

06:41.776 --> 06:44.403
I rest my case.

06:44.487 --> 06:45.196
- Okay, insects.

06:45.279 --> 06:48.157
All right, I can
work with that.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.659
How about you, Aaron?

06:49.742 --> 06:51.786
- I know this makes me
sound like a little kid,

06:51.869 --> 06:53.287
but I'm afraid of fire.

06:53.371 --> 06:55.540
- Uh, no, no, no, that's a fear
we want you to hang on to.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.127
- Then it guess it would be
great to not be afraid

06:59.210 --> 07:00.878
of that big kid at
church, Maurice.

07:00.962 --> 07:03.464
- Didn't Maurice move?

07:03.548 --> 07:06.008
- Oh, right. Then I'm good.

07:06.092 --> 07:08.344
- Don't worry, buddy, we'll get
you afraid of something.

07:08.427 --> 07:11.430
Meanwhile, we'll start on Gabby
and then we'll move on to James.

07:11.514 --> 07:12.765
- I love when you
fix my kids.

07:12.849 --> 07:15.601
You're adorable.

07:15.685 --> 07:16.978
- You know what's
not adorable?

07:17.061 --> 07:19.355
A clown with
a permanent tear.

07:19.438 --> 07:21.899
That means he's
taken a life.

07:24.193 --> 07:26.487
- I thought your biggest fear
was hair in your food.

07:26.571 --> 07:27.363
- If I told Stephanie that,

07:27.446 --> 07:30.324
she'd start serving
up hairy food

07:30.408 --> 07:31.826
and don't nobody want that.

07:31.909 --> 07:33.786
So, I had to give
her a fake fear

07:33.870 --> 07:35.621
that I could fake
getting over.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.456
- I think you should
be honest with her.

07:37.540 --> 07:38.833
She just wants to help.

07:38.916 --> 07:40.751
- You really wanna go
down the honesty road,

07:40.835 --> 07:43.462
man who's afraid
of dying alone?

07:43.546 --> 07:45.840
[laughing] That's
not your real fear.

07:45.923 --> 07:49.635
- You don't know
what you think you know.

07:49.719 --> 07:52.388
- Oh, I know what I know.

07:52.471 --> 07:53.389
Allow me to set the scene.

07:53.472 --> 07:57.518
It's a humid July day
at Liberty Fun Park.

07:57.602 --> 07:59.854
I'm wearing a blue
polka-dot romper,

07:59.937 --> 08:03.232
you're wearing socks
with sandals.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.193
We're on the kiddie coaster.

08:05.276 --> 08:07.236
- You remember all that?

08:07.320 --> 08:09.280
You were only five.

08:09.363 --> 08:13.326
- Well, it's hard to forget your
dad weeping uncontrollably.

08:13.409 --> 08:15.328
You're afraid of
rollercoasters.

08:15.411 --> 08:17.288
That's why you
never take James.

08:17.371 --> 08:21.250
- Uh! Shh! Shh! Shh!
Shh! Shh!

08:21.334 --> 08:22.710
You tell Stephanie...
- Mm-hm?

08:22.793 --> 08:24.962
- ...and you're gonna find long,
nasty strands of hair

08:25.046 --> 08:28.090
in your food until
the day you go to college.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.467
Even then, I'll ship
'em to ya.

08:29.550 --> 08:31.093
You'll think it'll be
a care package,

08:31.177 --> 08:34.847
but it'll really be
a hair package.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.725
- ♪

08:37.808 --> 08:42.145
- Stephanie, did you put this
cricket in the butter dish?

08:42.230 --> 08:45.566
- Did it scare you?
- GABBY: [gasping]

08:45.650 --> 08:47.818
No, but you just did.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.445
- What about the beetle
in the crisper.

08:49.528 --> 08:51.405
- There's a beetle
in the crisper?

08:51.489 --> 08:54.283
Okay, Stephanie, stop putting
bugs where they don't belong.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.244
I told you--between
the breathing exercises

08:56.327 --> 08:59.580
and all your insect immersion
videos, I'm cured.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.624
- Are you sure you've watched
enough of those?

09:01.707 --> 09:03.459
Because I still have
the director's cut

09:03.543 --> 09:05.711
of the one about moths.

09:05.795 --> 09:09.590
- Nope. Thanks to you,
I'm completely over my fear.

09:09.674 --> 09:12.093
- Does this mean I rehearsed
my honey dance for nothing?

09:12.176 --> 09:15.263
- No, you can still do it.

09:15.346 --> 09:18.432
- Don't patronize me.

09:18.516 --> 09:20.142
- Sorry, buddy.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.435
I'm glad you're
over your fear.

09:21.519 --> 09:23.229
I knew we could do
this together.

09:23.312 --> 09:24.855
Sorry, buddy.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.649
- Hey, little bro.
Guess what?

09:26.732 --> 09:28.985
I'm cured of my fear.
You know what that means.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.988
- Now Stephanie's gonna
focus all her crazy on me?

09:32.071 --> 09:35.241
- FYI--it's a whole
lotta crazy.

09:35.324 --> 09:37.576
Crisper crazy.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.203
- Crisper crazy?
What's that mean?

09:39.287 --> 09:40.997
What's in the crisper?

09:41.080 --> 09:42.999
I was gonna get
a tangerine.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.876
Dude, clowns.
What am I gonna do?

09:45.960 --> 09:47.169
- Really? Nothing?

09:47.253 --> 09:50.172
I am standing here
dressed as a bee.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.717
- I've got bigger problems.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.094
Stephanie's gonna come after
me and I need your help.

09:55.177 --> 09:56.721
- As long as I can
wear this costume.

09:56.804 --> 10:00.099
I spent six
allowances on it.

10:00.182 --> 10:02.310
- No, I need you to
be afraid of something, quick,

10:02.393 --> 10:05.021
so Stephanie moves on to you
and she'll leave me alone.

10:05.104 --> 10:07.857
- Can't do it, James.
I'm not afraid of anything.

10:07.940 --> 10:10.693
You know who you
should go to? Dad.

10:10.776 --> 10:12.069
He's scared of
rollercoasters.

10:12.153 --> 10:14.739
- Wait. What? Dad's afraid
of rollercoasters?

10:14.822 --> 10:15.948
How did I not know that?

10:16.032 --> 10:19.618
- Maybe because you're
a little too self-involved.

10:19.702 --> 10:22.496
- ♪

10:22.580 --> 10:25.416
- Okay, James, I know
this might be traumatic,

10:25.499 --> 10:28.419
but we are gonna get
over your fear of clowns...

10:28.502 --> 10:29.545
together.

10:29.628 --> 10:31.422
- Clowns? You must
not have heard.

10:31.505 --> 10:33.758
I'm cured.
- Yes, he is.

10:33.841 --> 10:36.802
He is not faking.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.596
- I don't buy it.
- Me, neither.

10:38.679 --> 10:41.015
- It's true. I was listening to
all that stuff you told Gabby,

10:41.098 --> 10:43.184
so I did the breathing
exercises and, poof,

10:43.267 --> 10:44.685
my fear was gone.

10:44.769 --> 10:46.562
- Hm, that's so great.

10:46.645 --> 10:48.939
Just one thing. Rah!

10:49.023 --> 10:50.483
- Nice picture, Steph.

10:50.566 --> 10:53.027
Old boyfriend?

10:53.110 --> 10:56.280
- Wow. Okay.

10:56.364 --> 11:00.534
I wanna stuff you
in my little car!

11:00.618 --> 11:01.994
- Let's go!

11:02.078 --> 11:04.830
Oh, and bring
23 of your buddies.

11:04.914 --> 11:08.042
- James, I'm impressed.

11:08.125 --> 11:10.628
- And now that I am no
longer afraid of clowns,

11:10.711 --> 11:14.423
you are now free to
work on Dad's fear.

11:14.507 --> 11:19.345
- Uh-uh-uh, I have no fear.
I have my wife, remember?

11:19.428 --> 11:20.513
[kissing]

11:20.596 --> 11:22.223
- Hold it, Hot Lips.

11:22.306 --> 11:23.265
You're telling me you
don't have a crippling

11:23.349 --> 11:25.768
fear of rollercoasters?

11:25.851 --> 11:29.855
- Oh! You're afraid
of rollercoasters?

11:29.939 --> 11:32.024
- Pfft! No.
[laughing]

11:32.108 --> 11:35.694
What? No.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.405
Huh?

11:37.488 --> 11:39.115
- Wait, I have a great idea.

11:39.198 --> 11:39.990
James, what's the name
of that rollercoaster

11:40.074 --> 11:42.660
you won't shut up about?
- Knock-knock.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.537
- Just the name.

11:44.620 --> 11:47.123
- The "Monster Machine"
at Liberty Fun Park.

11:47.206 --> 11:49.125
- That's it. We're
going this Saturday.

11:49.208 --> 11:52.294
Charlie, you need to
face your fear

11:52.378 --> 11:53.546
head on and kick it
in the teeth.

11:53.629 --> 11:54.880
- Yeah, like I did
with clowns.

11:54.964 --> 11:57.007
- Oh, did you?

11:57.091 --> 11:58.509
Did ya?
[goofy laugh]

11:58.592 --> 12:02.930
Did ya!
[goofy laugh continues]

12:03.013 --> 12:05.683
- Yes, I did.
[goofy laugh]

12:09.019 --> 12:10.229
- Come on, Charlie,

12:10.312 --> 12:12.106
we'll start with pictures
of rollercoasters

12:12.189 --> 12:13.399
and I'll blow
on your face,

12:13.482 --> 12:16.110
so you can feel the wind.

12:16.193 --> 12:20.656
- Great. Now I'm afraid
of dying alone again.

12:20.739 --> 12:26.120
Falling 500 feet onto
a churro cart.

12:26.203 --> 12:27.705
- Hey, you weren't
faking, were you?

12:27.788 --> 12:29.039
You're really not afraid
of clowns anymore.

12:29.123 --> 12:33.794
- Give me my blankie!

12:33.878 --> 12:37.256
[muffled screaming,
sobbing]

12:38.257 --> 12:39.758
Ah...

12:39.842 --> 12:41.886
[muffled screaming,
sobbing]

12:45.014 --> 12:47.099
- Come on, guys. Hurry.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.018
Let's get on while
the line is short.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.519
- I'm trying, but Dad
keeps tripping me.

12:50.603 --> 12:54.356
- Prove it!
[stamps feet]

12:54.440 --> 12:55.691
- Okay, Charlie, we've
been here for hours

12:55.774 --> 12:58.861
and all we've done
is spend $300

12:58.944 --> 13:02.531
trying to win a $2
stuffed banana!

13:02.615 --> 13:05.409
- Yeah, and we rode every animal
on the merry-go-round

13:05.493 --> 13:06.619
plus that bench
that doesn't move.

13:06.702 --> 13:09.705
- You know what
we haven't done.

13:09.788 --> 13:11.207
Caricatures!

13:11.290 --> 13:13.209
I'm thinking the whole
family on skates.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.043
- No more stalling.

13:14.126 --> 13:16.879
I wanna ride
the Monster Machine.

13:16.962 --> 13:18.464
Knock-knock, who's there?

13:18.547 --> 13:21.133
Me and I wanna get
on so bad!

13:21.217 --> 13:24.303
- Aaron and I have been
on every ride in this park

13:24.386 --> 13:26.138
that he's allowed to go on.

13:26.222 --> 13:29.475
- We got caricatures.
Look how big my head is.

13:29.558 --> 13:33.145
And I'm surfing!

13:33.229 --> 13:35.397
- That mean's the guy's free.
Now's our time.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.316
- Dad, please?
- MAGGIE: Charlie!

13:37.399 --> 13:40.361
Ooh, ya look awful.

13:40.444 --> 13:42.154
I take it the ride
didn't go very well.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.281
- We haven't been
on it yet.

13:44.365 --> 13:45.366
- Look at that coaster.

13:45.449 --> 13:46.492
It's the highest, fastest,

13:46.575 --> 13:50.287
scariest thing
I've ever seen.

13:50.371 --> 13:51.413
- Oh, hear that, Steph?

13:51.497 --> 13:54.416
He's afraid of it, too.
Make him ride, instead.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.294
- Sweet! The sign says
I can't, but Dad says I can.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.213
Thanks, Dad!
- CHARLIE: [laughing]

13:59.296 --> 14:01.757
- No, no, no, no, no.
You stay with Grandma Maggie.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.551
Charlie, don't turn on your
son because you're afraid.

14:03.634 --> 14:06.845
- I'm not afraid,
I'm concerned.

14:06.929 --> 14:09.473
Have you seen all
these warning signs

14:09.557 --> 14:11.767
about pre-existing
conditions, huh?

14:11.850 --> 14:14.562
I've got pre-existing
conditions out the wazoo--

14:14.645 --> 14:16.772
which is also
a pre-existing condition.

14:18.023 --> 14:23.195
- Will somebody get that
scaredy cat on the ride

14:23.279 --> 14:27.074
so we can all go home!

14:27.157 --> 14:30.286
- Why is everyone so
worried about my fear?

14:30.369 --> 14:31.954
How come no one's asked
about Maggie's fear, huh?

14:32.037 --> 14:35.874
- They don't have to
because I don't have any fear.

14:35.958 --> 14:39.837
I instill it--gimme
that funnel cake!

14:39.920 --> 14:41.505
- Mommy!

14:42.381 --> 14:43.924
- See?

14:46.427 --> 14:50.764
Now Aaron and I are going
to get me another sweat tea

14:50.848 --> 14:51.849
from the Cajun Castle.

14:51.932 --> 14:54.768
- But you must be so tired.
I'll go get it.

14:54.852 --> 14:55.811
- Charlie Phillips,
you get on this ride.

14:55.894 --> 15:01.275
My mom can get her
own diabetes drink.

15:01.358 --> 15:02.818
- Grandma Maggie, after
we get the sweet tea--

15:02.901 --> 15:05.321
- You're not gettin' me
up on that thing!

15:05.404 --> 15:10.159
- ♪

15:10.242 --> 15:13.495
- I can't believe
you tackled me.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.914
- I can't believe
you went down that easy.

15:15.998 --> 15:19.710
- Focus. We are about
to experience the highest

15:19.793 --> 15:22.796
rollercoaster drop legally
allowed by Pennsylvania law.

15:22.880 --> 15:26.342
They put that light on top
so airplanes don't hit us.

15:26.425 --> 15:27.843
- Oh, hey, look.

15:27.926 --> 15:31.722
That's the park entrance
way down there.

15:31.805 --> 15:35.601
- Don't point at things
way down there.

15:35.684 --> 15:38.354
Oh, what's that noise?
It sounds mechanical.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.105
- Oh! It is mechanical.

15:40.189 --> 15:41.815
We are on a rollercoaster.

15:41.899 --> 15:43.692
Everything is fine.

15:43.776 --> 15:44.568
- How do you know?

15:44.652 --> 15:46.403
Did you build it?
Are you an engineer?

15:46.487 --> 15:50.324
Or do you just hang
streamers for a living?

15:50.407 --> 15:51.367
- Don't go there, Charlie.

15:51.450 --> 15:54.370
- Oh, everybody said you'd
be the death of me.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.372
But I said, "No, she's
young, she's fun."

15:56.455 --> 15:58.540
"She'll bring something
new to my life."

15:58.624 --> 16:00.709
I didn't know
it would be the end.

16:00.793 --> 16:04.546
- Charlie, I promise you are
going to survive this ride.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.590
You won't even remember
all the things you're saying.

16:06.674 --> 16:10.594
But I will.

16:10.678 --> 16:13.055
- JAMES: Here we go!
- GABBY: Yeah.

16:13.138 --> 16:16.225
- [metallic thud]
- JAMES: Uh-oh!

16:16.308 --> 16:18.060
- That's all a part
of the ride, right?

16:18.143 --> 16:18.977
- STEPHANIE: No.

16:19.061 --> 16:22.022
But that thing that
just fell off was.

16:26.568 --> 16:28.862
- Ahhhh...

16:28.946 --> 16:34.326
There is nothing like
a cold sweet tea.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.161
- You said that
four sweet teas ago.

16:39.164 --> 16:43.085
- Why are you all up
in my tea count?

16:43.168 --> 16:45.587
Ooh, I do have
to go, though.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.297
- The bathroom's
right over there.

16:47.381 --> 16:49.007
I'll wait outside.

16:49.091 --> 16:51.593
- Ha! You can wait
on the moon

16:51.677 --> 16:54.388
before I go in
a public restroom.

16:54.471 --> 16:55.431
- That sounds like
you're afraid.

16:55.514 --> 16:58.267
I thought you said you
didn't have any fears.

16:58.350 --> 17:00.102
- That is no fear.

17:00.185 --> 17:04.772
That is a healthy respect
for something that can kill ya.

17:04.857 --> 17:09.611
- And we call that?
- My business.

17:09.694 --> 17:11.405
- Stephanie says
that's your fear talking.

Stephanie says you've gotta
kick fear right in the teeth.

17:14.074 --> 17:19.121

- Stephanie needs to shut up!

17:19.204 --> 17:20.122
Oh. Unh.

17:20.204 --> 17:22.790
- You need to confront
your fear head on--

17:22.875 --> 17:24.710
the same way Gabby
and my dad did.

17:24.792 --> 17:27.713
- I told you I am
not going in there.

17:27.796 --> 17:29.965
- In that case, I'm going
to have to make you.

to see that, little man.

that I dated

18:14.551 --> 18:18.180
that I could have married
instead of you.

from the fish market?

It's gonna be okay.
Oh, what the heck is that?

18:28.065 --> 18:29.691
- It's a caterpillar.

18:29.775 --> 18:30.734
I already named
him Coaster Carl.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.778
- Don't name him,
kill him.

18:32.861 --> 18:34.863
Get him out of here!

cool, remember?

18:36.865 --> 18:38.700
You're not afraid
of insects anymore.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.620

never afraid of insects.

18:41.703 --> 18:44.164
She's afraid of hair
in her food.

of insects?

all of your insect horror videos
started giving me nightmares.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.214
Now I'm afraid.

- Why didn't you just tell me
you were afraid of hair in food?

18:54.758 --> 18:56.593
- Because I didn't
want you to make me

different kinda curly fries.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.225

We are already up here
on a wing and a prayer.

a second and a half up here.

someone up to help us.

Nobody breathe or move
until they can get up here!

I just realized something.

- That when my eyes water
from too much altitude,

19:49.521 --> 19:52.399
it looks a lot
like I'm crying?

19:52.482 --> 19:54.026
- No, I just realized

19:54.109 --> 19:55.444
that I have an even bigger
fear than swimming--

19:55.527 --> 20:00.407
that I'll try to help my family
and just scar them for life.

20:00.490 --> 20:02.117

has sailed.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.036

I helped James.

and you rock.

20:06.538 --> 20:08.790
