01:32.844 --> 01:35.180
Take them into the forest now.

02:01.372 --> 02:03.416
You stay here.

02:03.958 --> 02:05.460
I'll be back soon.

02:07.378 --> 02:08.545
- Wait!
- No!

02:08.670 --> 02:10.340
I said, stay here!

02:17.096 --> 02:18.890
Father! Wait!

03:21.619 --> 03:22.620
Help us! Please!

03:22.704 --> 03:24.184
Hello! Is anybody there?

04:46.162 --> 04:47.705
Eat!

04:51.125 --> 04:52.126
- Eat!

05:01.511 --> 05:02.553
Eat!

05:04.681 --> 05:06.057
Eat!

05:10.311 --> 05:13.231
This oven's not hot enough!

05:13.314 --> 05:14.357
More wood!

05:43.428 --> 05:44.595
What?

06:09.287 --> 06:11.372
Is it hot enough for you now, bitch?

06:17.128 --> 06:20.214
<i>My sister and I
never saw our parents again.</i>

06:21.174 --> 06:23.259
<i>It was just the two of us.</i>

06:23.968 --> 06:26.804
<i>But we learned a couple of things
while trapped in that house.</i>

06:27.972 --> 06:31.142
<i>One: Never walk into a house
made of candy.</i>

06:33.811 --> 06:37.523
<i>And two: If you're gonna kill a witch,</i>

06:37.607 --> 06:38.900
<i>set her ass on fire.</i>

09:06.964 --> 09:09.050
Fresh milk! Fresh milk

09:09.133 --> 09:13.387
for the children!
Keep your children healthy! Fresh milk!

09:14.764 --> 09:17.600
After weeks of living in fear,

09:17.683 --> 09:22.688
we have finally caught the one
responsible for all this terror!

09:22.772 --> 09:27.443
For crimes against
the city and people of Augsburg,

09:28.319 --> 09:33.866
and for consorting with
the spawn of Satan,

09:35.243 --> 09:39.789
I hereby accuse this woman

09:40.957 --> 09:44.418
of the craft of witchery!

09:44.669 --> 09:47.380
Burn her! Burn her!

09:49.257 --> 09:50.591
Behold

09:51.759 --> 09:53.552
the eyes of the demon.

09:56.013 --> 09:57.223
Go to hell.

10:05.564 --> 10:06.983
Order!

10:07.441 --> 10:08.484
Order!

10:12.697 --> 10:13.739
Berringer,

10:14.198 --> 10:16.534
this is still my town.

10:19.203 --> 10:20.663
Listen to me.

10:21.455 --> 10:24.500
As your mayor, I know only too well

10:24.583 --> 10:29.046
that many of you
have lost precious loved ones to this

10:29.171 --> 10:33.009
witch plague,
but we can't just burn this woman.

10:33.092 --> 10:35.136
We first need evidence.

10:35.219 --> 10:36.429
We can't just have...

10:36.512 --> 10:39.724
You know a witch when you see one!

10:39.807 --> 10:43.894
They ride at night
and they make pacts with the devil!

10:44.937 --> 10:48.524
This woman will burn!

10:48.607 --> 10:51.068
Burn her! Burn her!

10:58.492 --> 11:02.038
Let the girl go
or I'm gonna blow your sheriff's brains

11:02.121 --> 11:04.248
all over these fucking hillbillies.

11:06.417 --> 11:08.169
Move. Go on.

11:08.252 --> 11:10.671
Let her go. Go over there.

11:10.755 --> 11:11.797
Check her.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.092
What's your name?

11:16.260 --> 11:17.595
What's your name?

11:18.304 --> 11:20.389
- Mina.
- Don't worry.

11:20.765 --> 11:24.435
When a woman truly deals in witchcraft,
she cannot hide it.

11:24.518 --> 11:29.315
A nasty rot sets in. It shows in her teeth,

11:29.398 --> 11:31.067
in her skin and her eyes.

11:31.150 --> 11:34.278
This is not a witch. This woman's clean.

11:35.780 --> 11:40.409
I'm sure your sheriff was only trying
to protect you good people.

11:40.493 --> 11:42.828
But your mayor has done
a very smart thing.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.915
He hired us.

11:45.998 --> 11:48.042
My name is Gretel,

11:48.125 --> 11:50.336
and this is my brother, Hansel.

11:51.545 --> 11:53.756
We know that many
of your children have gone missing.

11:53.839 --> 11:57.218
But killing an innocent woman
will not bring them back.

11:57.301 --> 11:59.387
Go home! We don't want you here!

11:59.470 --> 12:00.971
We don't want more evil in Augsburg!

12:01.055 --> 12:04.225
Well, evil is upon you,
whether you like it or not.

12:05.309 --> 12:07.353
Now if your children are still alive,

12:08.479 --> 12:11.982
we will find them.
But if anyone harms this woman,

12:13.484 --> 12:15.236
you're gonna have me to deal with.

12:15.319 --> 12:17.238
Now go home!

12:17.321 --> 12:19.156
Go!

12:28.499 --> 12:30.751
I guess you're free to go.

12:32.294 --> 12:33.462
Thank you,

12:35.506 --> 12:36.674
Hansel.

12:38.008 --> 12:39.176
You're welcome.

12:41.053 --> 12:43.889
What the hell do you think
you're doing? Huh?

12:43.973 --> 12:47.601
That woman is a suspect in my custody.
You can't just come here...

12:47.685 --> 12:51.021
Any man with half a brain
could see that she was not a witch.

12:51.439 --> 12:52.731
Now listen, Sheriff.

12:52.815 --> 12:54.608
Hansel and Gretel
have been brought here...

12:54.692 --> 12:56.694
You better listen!

12:57.862 --> 13:01.240
I'm not going to have this bitch
and her scoundrel of a brother

13:01.907 --> 13:03.242
coming into my town,

13:05.536 --> 13:07.204
telling me what to do.

13:13.878 --> 13:15.713
Don't!

13:16.297 --> 13:17.798
Just don't.

13:22.887 --> 13:25.598
Come on. Let's get you started.

13:26.724 --> 13:30.269
<i>There's been reports of
a strange cottage in the north forest.</i>

13:31.020 --> 13:33.314
<i>Locals won't go near the place.</i>

13:34.565 --> 13:37.234
<i>A good place to start the investigation.</i>

13:52.208 --> 13:53.751
Move!

15:38.355 --> 15:39.898
Gretel!

16:01.378 --> 16:03.130
She looks angry.

16:03.881 --> 16:05.716
Yeah.

16:05.799 --> 16:08.469
A face like that, I'd be angry, too.

16:11.388 --> 16:12.640
- Would you shut up?

16:13.724 --> 16:16.018
<i>That witch we found
was a dead end, Mayor.</i>

16:16.101 --> 16:17.770
<i>No trace of any kids. I'm sorry.</i>

16:17.853 --> 16:19.688
But we found this.

16:22.441 --> 16:24.693
That is called the Blood Moon, Mayor.

16:25.444 --> 16:26.945
An eclipse of the moon.

16:27.029 --> 16:30.115
It happens once in a generation
and is a night most holy to witches.

16:30.908 --> 16:32.201
Oh, my God.

16:32.910 --> 16:33.911
When?

16:33.994 --> 16:36.914
According to this,
three nights from now.

16:36.997 --> 16:39.458
There's no doubt in my mind
that all this is connected.

16:39.541 --> 16:41.502
Children being taken in these numbers

16:41.585 --> 16:43.629
from the roads and fields
so close to town.

16:43.712 --> 16:47.424
A witch does not come out
in the open like that.

16:47.508 --> 16:48.967
Not unless she has to.

16:51.595 --> 16:54.431
Witch activity
has been increasing lately.

16:54.515 --> 16:57.518
More sightings,
animal slaughter, Sabbaths.

16:58.435 --> 17:00.104
It seems the coming of the Blood Moon

17:00.187 --> 17:03.440
is dragging every damned witch
from their dark hiding place.

17:04.608 --> 17:06.443
So,

17:07.444 --> 17:08.529
it seems like a good thing

17:08.612 --> 17:10.571
that you brought us here,
doesn't it, Mayor?

17:11.824 --> 17:13.075
Half your money now.

17:13.157 --> 17:17.287
The rest when the children
are brought back alive.

17:18.789 --> 17:20.540
Oh, there he is, right on time.

17:20.624 --> 17:23.460
This is Jackson.
He knows these woods inside and out.

17:23.544 --> 17:25.963
And he'll take you to where
the last sightings were.

17:26.046 --> 17:28.549
Yeah. We can be there in a few hours.

17:28.632 --> 17:31.301
Not at night. It's too dangerous.

17:31.385 --> 17:32.553
We'll leave in the morning.

17:32.636 --> 17:34.638
Yeah, she's right.
It's much too dangerous.

17:35.472 --> 17:39.059
So, any place
we can get a drink in this hellhole?

17:45.607 --> 17:46.692
Shut up!

17:46.775 --> 17:49.862
The last one
they took was a boy.

17:49.945 --> 17:54.158
Less than two days ago,
so the scent is still fresh.

17:55.534 --> 18:00.497
100 shilling for every child
you return alive.

18:01.498 --> 18:02.541
You better be fast

18:03.125 --> 18:06.086
before our mayor's witch hunters

18:06.170 --> 18:08.380
rob this town blind.

18:09.047 --> 18:10.174
You leave tonight.

18:11.675 --> 18:15.429
In witch country at night?

18:15.512 --> 18:16.680
You must be out of your mind.

18:30.360 --> 18:33.489
Not until you finish the job.

18:37.868 --> 18:38.994
Thank you, Wolfgang.

19:20.702 --> 19:22.204
I'm telling you,

19:23.163 --> 19:24.748
we should put the fire out.

19:24.873 --> 19:26.113
We're hunting witches,

19:26.917 --> 19:29.837
not bears. And we have to eat.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.823
Such beautiful creatures.

20:01.118 --> 20:02.744
Are they yours?

20:04.121 --> 20:05.289
Yes, ma'am.

20:07.332 --> 20:09.334
Why have you come here?

20:10.502 --> 20:13.964
To the dark of the forest?

20:15.716 --> 20:17.384
A child was taken, ma'am.

20:19.553 --> 20:22.431
We're here to find him
and take him back.

20:23.807 --> 20:26.435
There are no children here.

20:29.897 --> 20:31.231
Here...

20:32.816 --> 20:34.401
There's only death!

20:36.695 --> 20:37.738
- Witch!

20:38.697 --> 20:39.781
Fools!

20:47.915 --> 20:49.833
This is my land!

20:58.425 --> 21:00.427
How dare you?

21:17.986 --> 21:19.029
Please?

21:19.571 --> 21:20.864
Hmm...

21:21.156 --> 21:23.116
Please, God... No.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.744
There's no use in praying, my friend.

21:26.787 --> 21:32.042
Even your God knows better
than to come here.

21:52.688 --> 21:55.315
So we got this witch
on the ground, right?

21:55.399 --> 21:59.069
And her eyes, they start rolling back
in her head. They're glowing red.

21:59.152 --> 22:01.279
She's trying to put
a Soul Searcher spell on me, you see.

22:01.363 --> 22:03.865
So I slap her and rip out her tongue.

22:03.949 --> 22:08.829
And she starts pissing, starts pissing
everywhere, right?

22:08.954 --> 22:11.331
But a witch's piss,
it's the worst, you see,

22:11.415 --> 22:14.626
because it actually burns the ground.
It's like acid.

22:15.335 --> 22:19.214
Although, in small doses,
it does cure poison ivy, insect bites.

22:19.297 --> 22:21.258
I'm getting way off the subject, aren't I?

22:21.341 --> 22:23.969
I've got to get back to my friends.

22:29.766 --> 22:30.934
What are you looking at?

22:31.435 --> 22:34.187
There have been
abductions here and here,

22:34.271 --> 22:35.605
on both sides of the river.

22:35.981 --> 22:37.649
And on this last one,

22:38.108 --> 22:40.027
we believe a troll was involved.

22:40.110 --> 22:42.320
- A troll?
- Trolls are extra.

22:42.779 --> 22:46.033
Hey, so what's wrong with the girls
in this place, huh?

22:46.241 --> 22:47.367
I mean, correct me if I'm wrong,

22:47.451 --> 22:49.786
but aren't bar wenches
supposed to be easy?

22:49.870 --> 22:52.956
- It's really unusual.
- Yes, it is unusual.

22:53.081 --> 22:54.082
Look at this one.

22:54.750 --> 22:56.626
A father and three children attacked.

22:57.294 --> 22:59.755
One child was taken,
but she didn't touch the other two.

22:59.838 --> 23:01.548
- Uh-oh.
- That's weird.

23:01.673 --> 23:02.716
That's so weird.

23:02.799 --> 23:05.594
- It is strange. It is strange, okay!
- Yeah, yeah.

23:05.677 --> 23:07.387
Then again,
we hunt witches for a living.

23:07.471 --> 23:08.555
What's normal, really?

23:08.638 --> 23:11.558
Excuse me. Hansel and Gretel?

23:11.641 --> 23:13.477
Oh, my God, I can't believe you're here.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.395
I'm Ben. Benjamin Walser.

23:15.479 --> 23:18.065
I am really quite a fan of your work.

23:18.148 --> 23:19.232
That's great.

23:19.316 --> 23:21.068
It's nice to meet you, Benjamin.

23:21.151 --> 23:22.778
Listen, if it's not too much trouble,

23:22.861 --> 23:24.571
- would you please sign...
- Oh, no...

23:24.654 --> 23:26.406
Okay.

23:26.490 --> 23:27.991
- Oh, my.

23:28.075 --> 23:30.577
Yeah, that's from when you
found the Fox Witch of Antwerp

23:30.660 --> 23:31.787
- and sank her in the moat.
- Oh!

23:31.870 --> 23:34.748
And this one's from the
Secret Witch Ring of Belsen.

23:34.831 --> 23:37.667
When they tried to put a gate to
hell under the courthouse.

23:37.751 --> 23:40.432
I mean, you guys, you certainly
taught those witches a thing or two.

23:40.504 --> 23:41.588
Wow.

23:41.671 --> 23:44.591
- This is amazing.
- And, uh, weird.

23:44.674 --> 23:46.426
- A little creepy.
- Yeah...

23:46.510 --> 23:48.095
You really keep all this stuff.

23:48.178 --> 23:49.179
All right, well...

23:49.262 --> 23:51.890
I just have so many questions.
Do you mind?

23:51.973 --> 23:53.517
- You know, we have...
- Oh, no, no.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.268
- You go ahead.
- All right, um...

23:56.895 --> 23:59.981
Okay. Um, how do you best kill a witch?

24:00.065 --> 24:01.149
Hansel?

24:02.692 --> 24:05.278
Uh, cutting off their heads tends to work.

24:05.362 --> 24:06.613
Ripping out their hearts.

24:06.696 --> 24:08.490
And skinning them is also nice.

24:08.573 --> 24:10.534
Yeah, but burning is the best way.

24:10.617 --> 24:12.536
'Cause that's the only way to be safe.

24:12.619 --> 24:15.205
- Burning, yeah, of course.
- Burn them all.

24:15.288 --> 24:18.041
Oh, is it true that
witches can't harm you?

24:19.626 --> 24:21.795
Well, no, that is horseshit, son.

24:21.878 --> 24:23.547
Their magic doesn't work on us.

24:23.672 --> 24:26.258
And they haven't killed us, yet.

24:26.341 --> 24:27.702
Oh, do you think that's because of

24:27.717 --> 24:30.053
the witch that you burned
when you were children?

24:30.137 --> 24:32.472
I guess that's how
it all started for you guys.

24:32.556 --> 24:34.766
I mean, is that how
you became witch hunters?

24:34.850 --> 24:35.976
How did you get your guns?

24:36.059 --> 24:37.310
- How did you get your weapons?
- Okay, okay.

24:37.394 --> 24:40.272
There's lots of things to do.
You're a really nice kid,

24:40.355 --> 24:42.482
but we have a town under attack.

24:47.070 --> 24:48.530
She killed them!

24:51.575 --> 24:52.993
She killed them all.

24:53.827 --> 24:55.412
Who killed what?

24:55.996 --> 24:57.164
The witch!

24:58.165 --> 25:00.208
She killed the trackers. All of them.

25:01.501 --> 25:03.795
She gave me a message.

25:04.963 --> 25:06.298
For you all.

25:27.777 --> 25:29.738
The Curse of Hunger
for Crawling Things.

25:33.617 --> 25:35.202
I fucking hate that one.

25:35.285 --> 25:37.787
That was awesome.

25:52.260 --> 25:56.473
The witch hunters are near,
I can smell their stench.

25:56.973 --> 25:58.642
Your plan's working.

25:59.434 --> 26:01.311
Did you bring the preparations?

26:01.394 --> 26:02.979
Of course, Muriel.

26:03.605 --> 26:06.441
Oiled frogs,
fattened on possum maggots.

26:06.524 --> 26:08.485
And Carpathian nightshade,

26:08.652 --> 26:10.695
deadly to the touch, most rare.

26:11.321 --> 26:12.489
And, Muriel,

26:15.116 --> 26:18.161
we brought something to test it with.

27:14.676 --> 27:16.553
Open your mouth.

27:17.929 --> 27:18.930
Open!

27:23.560 --> 27:25.895
Swallow, little pig!

27:28.815 --> 27:29.816
He's ready.

27:55.342 --> 27:56.426
It's working.

28:04.267 --> 28:07.020
It's not even warm.

28:07.103 --> 28:10.065
Muriel, this could change everything.

28:10.148 --> 28:13.610
It will change everything.

28:14.277 --> 28:17.781
We will be invincible.

28:17.864 --> 28:19.366
Ow, Ow! Take it out.

28:19.824 --> 28:22.285
Take it out! Take it out!

28:25.121 --> 28:26.873
It's of no use if it doesn't last.

28:26.956 --> 28:28.583
I can make it last.

28:31.294 --> 28:33.421
Forever.

29:00.240 --> 29:02.325
Where are we going?

29:03.159 --> 29:04.661
We're almost there.

29:14.003 --> 29:15.422
Hey.

29:16.464 --> 29:17.507
Hey.

29:18.341 --> 29:20.176
I just had this really weird dream.

29:21.177 --> 29:23.263
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

29:23.346 --> 29:24.472
About what?

29:28.184 --> 29:31.104
I think it was about our mother.

29:33.106 --> 29:34.858
We don't talk about that.

29:37.110 --> 29:38.445
Go to sleep.

30:12.061 --> 30:14.397
What do you think? Boy, girl?

30:14.856 --> 30:17.442
Okay. Here you go. I'll take this.

30:22.697 --> 30:24.491
A little small for you, maybe.

30:25.074 --> 30:26.784
Oh, hello.

30:27.368 --> 30:29.370
Uh, no, this, this is...

30:30.205 --> 30:31.539
This is not for me.

30:33.041 --> 30:35.752
Um, so, how goes the witch hunting?

30:35.835 --> 30:38.505
It's good. Witch hunting's good.

30:42.550 --> 30:44.677
It's strange being
among these people.

30:44.761 --> 30:45.803
Yeah?

30:46.596 --> 30:48.681
If you hadn't come,
they'd have burned me alive.

30:49.724 --> 30:51.559
Yeah, well, I probably
would have let them,

30:51.643 --> 30:53.603
but I'm old-fashioned that way.

30:53.728 --> 30:56.731
My sister, however,
requires a little bit more evidence

30:56.814 --> 30:58.191
before someone gets roasted.

31:01.653 --> 31:03.363
- Have you ever come across a witch

31:03.446 --> 31:04.606
that you didn't want to kill?

31:04.656 --> 31:06.032
No, never.

31:06.950 --> 31:08.868
The only good witch is a dead witch.

31:13.289 --> 31:14.958
- Can you hold this?
- Mmm-hmm.

31:22.966 --> 31:24.133
Are you all right?

31:24.467 --> 31:25.635
Yeah.

31:29.305 --> 31:30.848
When I was a kid,

31:31.641 --> 31:34.060
a witch made me eat
so much candy, I got sick.

31:35.186 --> 31:38.856
Something happened to me.
I have to take this injection

31:39.607 --> 31:41.526
every few hours or else I die.

31:43.111 --> 31:44.821
You have the sugar sickness.

31:47.198 --> 31:50.076
I actually know a thing or two about it
if you ever need any help...

31:50.159 --> 31:51.828
It's all right.

31:51.911 --> 31:53.621
- So...
- I'm fine.

32:01.629 --> 32:03.339
It was good seeing you.

32:03.423 --> 32:04.507
Yeah.

32:05.091 --> 32:06.676
You're very handsome.

32:07.385 --> 32:09.470
And no man in this town
will walk with me.

32:11.681 --> 32:13.349
And you have

32:14.100 --> 32:15.143
my pumpkin.

32:19.355 --> 32:21.274
I... I have to go.

32:22.191 --> 32:23.359
- See you.
- Mmm-hmm.

32:39.917 --> 32:41.669
It'll all be perfect.

32:41.753 --> 32:45.798
Daddy! Daddy,
please help me! I'm lost!

32:49.427 --> 32:51.095
Daddy, please!

32:55.224 --> 32:57.393
Please help me! I'm lost!

32:59.771 --> 33:02.940
Daddy, I'm scared!
I'm alone in the woods!

33:03.608 --> 33:05.943
I can help you, little boy.

33:06.444 --> 33:07.987
Sweet little boy.

33:08.613 --> 33:09.853
- Please help me!

33:10.615 --> 33:12.575
Daddy! I'm scared!

33:12.742 --> 33:14.577
I'm alone in the woods!

33:17.789 --> 33:19.290
<i>Please help...</i>

33:26.255 --> 33:27.965
You move, you die.

33:30.468 --> 33:31.719
Get her wand.

34:35.158 --> 34:36.159
Will you stop that?

35:13.738 --> 35:15.239
Ooh.

35:15.364 --> 35:16.949
I like your toys.

35:18.409 --> 35:22.497
They have brought
a live witch into my office!

35:22.622 --> 35:26.375
They need to interrogate her.
That's all there is to it. Now...

35:27.710 --> 35:30.546
Good night, Sheriff.

35:45.520 --> 35:47.772
Hey, wake up.

35:49.482 --> 35:50.733
What is she doing?

35:52.360 --> 35:53.694
I have no idea.

36:10.753 --> 36:12.255
I see them.

36:13.172 --> 36:14.549
Is she there?

36:15.216 --> 36:16.926
That Gretel bitch?

36:17.844 --> 36:21.180
Oh, yes, under the moon,

36:21.514 --> 36:23.099
over the sheriff,

36:24.225 --> 36:25.226
in the town.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.031
There she is.

36:40.950 --> 36:41.951
Good morning, sunshine.

36:42.076 --> 36:44.871
You tell us what we want
and this might not end up

36:44.954 --> 36:46.706
being the most painful night of your life.

36:46.789 --> 36:48.269
Why don't you two go fuck yourselves?

36:49.584 --> 36:52.086
No, no, better, fuck each other.

36:55.381 --> 36:57.216
These witches, they never learn.

37:04.932 --> 37:06.309
Let's try this again.

37:07.059 --> 37:10.479
Where are the children? Why so many?

37:11.397 --> 37:12.398
Where are the children?

37:12.481 --> 37:14.609
The blood of the twelve moons

37:14.692 --> 37:16.944
will soon be collected.

37:18.821 --> 37:20.156
And after that,

37:20.615 --> 37:23.951
only one object remains.

37:25.620 --> 37:27.371
Why don't you just burn her?

37:27.872 --> 37:29.790
We're wasting our time. She's useless.

37:29.874 --> 37:32.501
Twelve moons. Twelve...

37:32.627 --> 37:34.045
Twelve, twelve...

37:34.128 --> 37:36.464
How many children
have been taken so far?

37:36.839 --> 37:38.591
I don't know, ten or eleven.

37:38.674 --> 37:40.509
The files. We need to count them.

37:46.849 --> 37:49.477
- It's eleven.
- Eleven. Twelve moons.

37:49.560 --> 37:51.312
They need one more child.
One more child.

37:51.395 --> 37:52.897
Look, there's
gotta be some sort of pattern.

37:52.980 --> 37:54.273
- Look for their age...
- Yeah.

37:54.357 --> 37:55.733
...hair color, genders, something.

37:55.816 --> 37:58.194
- I've got five girls.
- Six boys.

37:58.903 --> 38:00.029
You need another girl?

38:00.738 --> 38:02.178
"Twelve moons," what does that mean?

38:02.198 --> 38:03.866
It's a month. It's a month.

38:05.868 --> 38:07.828
There's no April. April is missing.
It's April.

38:07.954 --> 38:09.580
They need a girl born in April.

38:11.707 --> 38:13.125
You are too late.

38:22.593 --> 38:23.636
- Go!
- Yes!

38:26.055 --> 38:29.141
Sheriff, birth records of Augsburg.
Do you have them here?

38:29.225 --> 38:33.771
It is there. Strictly for the law
of this town, not for

38:33.854 --> 38:35.648
filthy bounty hunters like yourself.

38:35.731 --> 38:36.774
Come on.

38:37.817 --> 38:39.068
There can't be that many.

38:42.405 --> 38:43.406
Ah!

38:44.532 --> 38:45.700
- Anything?
- I only got one!

38:45.783 --> 38:47.618
Little girl, six years old, born April 8th.

38:48.744 --> 38:50.464
- She's the only one I could find.
- You go.

38:51.372 --> 38:52.456
This girl, do you know her?

38:52.540 --> 38:54.458
Yes, I know her. Mary Behlmer.

38:54.542 --> 38:57.003
Where does she live?
Sheriff, she's in danger!

39:06.887 --> 39:08.014
Fire! Fire!

39:10.182 --> 39:12.268
Time is up. Tell me where she lives.

39:26.032 --> 39:27.283
Over here!

39:34.832 --> 39:37.043
- Mama!
- Shh!

39:42.465 --> 39:44.133
Stop! Stop right there!

39:47.428 --> 39:49.638
Oh, no! No, no. Oh, no.

39:49.889 --> 39:51.599
No, Lucas! Lucas.

39:53.476 --> 39:54.643
No!

39:59.398 --> 40:01.442
Damn you!

40:02.068 --> 40:05.154
Too late, already damned.

40:09.700 --> 40:10.993
Take her back!

40:20.002 --> 40:21.420
To the Well!

40:21.504 --> 40:22.588
Over here!

40:23.339 --> 40:25.633
We need more help!

40:33.516 --> 40:36.018
Now whatever happens,
I want you to stay cool.

40:36.894 --> 40:39.772
- Follow my lead. Okay?
- Got it.

40:39.855 --> 40:41.565
Are you a good shot?

40:41.649 --> 40:42.983
No.

40:43.067 --> 40:44.527
Not really.

40:46.695 --> 40:48.030
That's why I use a shotgun.

41:01.127 --> 41:02.294
Gretel,

41:02.837 --> 41:04.505
the famous witch hunter.

41:06.048 --> 41:07.550
Finally we meet.

41:07.967 --> 41:09.093
Who are you?

41:12.680 --> 41:13.801
I see you got my invitation.

41:14.515 --> 41:17.309
Say your name
or I'll pin you to the fucking wall.

41:17.893 --> 41:19.228
I go by many names,

41:20.229 --> 41:23.899
none of which
you're worthy of pronouncing.

41:29.321 --> 41:30.364
Oh, my God.

41:49.758 --> 41:51.051
Help! Help!

41:52.761 --> 41:53.846
Please!

41:55.347 --> 41:56.348
Hey!

42:06.817 --> 42:07.943
Fuck you!

42:09.445 --> 42:11.363
Help!

42:15.534 --> 42:16.869
Feisty bitch.

43:15.427 --> 43:17.471
Shit.

43:31.110 --> 43:34.321
Don't worry.
I'm not going to kill you.

43:34.947 --> 43:36.198
Not now.

43:37.032 --> 43:38.575
And not like this.

43:40.911 --> 43:42.621
You

43:42.705 --> 43:44.540
have something I need.

43:45.666 --> 43:48.335
The last ingredient.

44:13.068 --> 44:16.905
Ugh! Humans have such ghastly taste.

44:27.291 --> 44:29.335
I think this place...

44:33.797 --> 44:35.632
...could use a bit

44:40.429 --> 44:42.097
of color.

45:00.949 --> 45:02.659
Shit!

45:11.585 --> 45:12.961
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

45:18.967 --> 45:22.179
Yes. No, people. Please be calm.

45:22.471 --> 45:24.431
Yeah, one at a time.

45:26.558 --> 45:32.981
Look what his witch hunters
have brought to Augsburg.

45:34.858 --> 45:38.362
Seven people burnt to death in the fire.

45:38.987 --> 45:43.492
And another young, innocent child taken

45:44.410 --> 45:47.162
because of those witch hunters.

45:48.539 --> 45:49.540
No.

45:51.166 --> 45:52.876
Because of you.

45:55.504 --> 45:58.090
I say bring them all to justice.

45:58.173 --> 45:59.425
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

45:59.508 --> 46:01.510
No! No!

46:03.053 --> 46:06.223
The witch hunters are not the ones
to blame for this.

46:08.183 --> 46:09.685
This is madness.

46:10.561 --> 46:11.562
People,

46:12.813 --> 46:14.773
hasn't enough blood been shed?

46:25.993 --> 46:27.119
No, no...

46:27.202 --> 46:28.620
Not enough, Mayor.

46:30.581 --> 46:31.748
Not yet.

47:05.908 --> 47:06.950
Ah!

47:09.161 --> 47:10.601
- Good morning.
- What are you doing?

47:10.662 --> 47:14.249
You were covered in filth, so I was just

47:15.083 --> 47:16.293
cleaning.

47:28.263 --> 47:29.848
What happened?

47:30.349 --> 47:31.600
Um...

47:32.518 --> 47:34.186
Well, the witches took a young girl,

47:34.269 --> 47:36.772
and a lot of people died in the fires.

47:37.189 --> 47:39.399
And now the Sheriff,
he's blaming you and your brother

47:39.483 --> 47:40.859
for what happened last night.

47:41.527 --> 47:43.362
Augsburg's not really
safe for you anymore.

47:43.445 --> 47:44.863
And my brother?

47:44.947 --> 47:46.281
Last time I saw him,
he was fighting one of them

47:46.365 --> 47:48.617
on her broom, flying out of town.

47:55.541 --> 47:56.708
Right.

47:58.627 --> 47:59.962
Wow.

48:00.629 --> 48:02.548
Where did you get all this stuff?

48:02.673 --> 48:04.007
Um...

48:04.132 --> 48:05.467
From everywhere.

48:06.051 --> 48:08.845
I actually plan to be a witch hunter,
too, when I get older.

48:08.929 --> 48:09.972
Like you guys.

48:10.889 --> 48:12.683
This isn't the life we chose, Ben.

48:17.646 --> 48:19.815
I was wondering about that story

48:20.816 --> 48:22.985
about your parents leaving you.

48:23.485 --> 48:24.987
Is all that true?

48:25.654 --> 48:26.697
Yep.

48:29.616 --> 48:30.784
Why?

48:32.786 --> 48:34.121
I don't know.

48:34.788 --> 48:36.456
That's what they did.

48:41.628 --> 48:44.631
Um, I'm sorry.
Do you want some porridge?

48:45.632 --> 48:46.967
Ah! Sure.

48:57.144 --> 49:01.315
Not too hot, not too cold, but just right.

49:09.865 --> 49:11.199
So last night,

49:11.325 --> 49:13.910
who was she,
the witch who attacked us?

49:15.120 --> 49:16.121
I don't know.

49:16.204 --> 49:20.208
She looked normal
at first, but then she changed her face.

49:21.126 --> 49:23.726
- I thought only Grand...
- Grand Witches have that ability, yeah.

49:31.053 --> 49:33.138
Who is this?

49:38.310 --> 49:41.188
She lived outside of town
a long time ago.

49:43.273 --> 49:46.026
<i>She was accused of witchcraft,
but she never confessed.</i>

49:47.027 --> 49:48.820
We just burned her anyway.

49:49.488 --> 49:50.572
You're safe.

49:51.615 --> 49:52.658
You'll be safe.

49:57.162 --> 49:58.747
I have to find my brother.

50:01.416 --> 50:02.751
Hansel!

50:03.752 --> 50:04.836
Hey!

50:04.961 --> 50:06.588
Hansel! Are you all right?

50:09.966 --> 50:11.635
Oh, shit.

50:13.970 --> 50:15.764
The witch hunting is going well, I see.

50:16.264 --> 50:17.432
Yeah.

50:20.102 --> 50:21.603
Hey, say, can you...

50:22.646 --> 50:25.357
Can you tell me
which way is back to town?

50:26.274 --> 50:27.275
That way.

50:29.194 --> 50:30.362
That way.

50:31.697 --> 50:32.823
Okay.

50:33.198 --> 50:34.366
Thank you!

50:35.534 --> 50:37.411
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

50:39.037 --> 50:41.790
- You need some help?
- No, I'm fine.

50:42.124 --> 50:43.792
I'm fine. Thank you.

50:44.918 --> 50:47.170
Okay. I'll see you later.

50:47.546 --> 50:49.047
Motherfucker!

50:54.136 --> 50:55.470
Are you okay?

50:55.637 --> 50:57.139
Hi. Help me.

51:05.981 --> 51:07.691
Hansel!

51:12.988 --> 51:14.656
Hansel!

51:17.075 --> 51:18.368
Hansel!

52:05.457 --> 52:06.458
Come here.

52:12.881 --> 52:15.008
Oh, she's a wild one, eh?

52:16.218 --> 52:17.552
What do you think you're doing?

52:17.928 --> 52:21.515
You're under arrest
for the burning of Augsburg

52:21.807 --> 52:24.684
and for bringing
the witch plague to our streets.

52:24.768 --> 52:27.979
Listen, you idiot! The witches are
planning something big!

52:28.063 --> 52:30.315
I need to find my brother
and save your shitty little...

52:30.398 --> 52:31.650
Shut up.

52:32.984 --> 52:34.236
This time,

52:35.320 --> 52:38.907
I do the talking. You do the bleeding.

52:46.248 --> 52:47.374
Are you done yet?

52:47.749 --> 52:49.543
I've got to get to my sister.

52:50.377 --> 52:52.087
This may take a while.

52:55.423 --> 52:57.592
But if we don't clean it,
you'll get the fever.

52:57.926 --> 52:59.845
Fever?

53:02.430 --> 53:04.266
You've really taken a beating,
haven't you?

53:05.767 --> 53:08.854
I think the real damage
was to my dignity,

53:09.688 --> 53:12.023
which I left somewhere
in that tree back there.

53:21.283 --> 53:23.410
It's probably gonna be easier
if you just get in.

53:25.203 --> 53:26.830
Oh, no, no. No, I can't.

53:27.122 --> 53:28.498
The water is healing.

53:29.374 --> 53:31.793
Yeah, I don't swim well.

53:32.377 --> 53:34.296
Then I'll go in with you.

53:37.549 --> 53:39.217
Oh, okay.

53:48.059 --> 53:49.477
Oh, boy.

53:59.279 --> 54:01.656
So, it's healing waters, did you say?

54:03.325 --> 54:05.327
I have a passion.

54:06.494 --> 54:08.663
Horses, just love them.

54:09.289 --> 54:10.790
Beautiful creatures, huh?

54:12.709 --> 54:16.755
When you break any kind of a horse,

54:16.838 --> 54:19.466
you have to be hard on them
from the beginning.

54:19.549 --> 54:21.676
Show them who's boss.

54:22.385 --> 54:25.388
Or else, they will never learn.

54:27.515 --> 54:29.851
At first, they will hate you.

54:31.061 --> 54:33.313
But once their spirit is broken,

54:35.649 --> 54:38.026
they will do anything you want.

54:44.240 --> 54:45.367
Oh!

54:45.450 --> 54:46.493
Bitch!

55:00.924 --> 55:04.052
Hey, boss, maybe we should
take her back to town now.

55:05.387 --> 55:08.181
I'm not finished breaking her yet!

55:11.643 --> 55:13.895
You're making this too easy.

55:21.695 --> 55:22.696
I got it.

55:27.242 --> 55:31.079
You know, the last time
I was in waters like this,

55:31.788 --> 55:34.833
I came across
a formidable Serpent Witch.

55:35.625 --> 55:37.544
She mostly looked like a toad

55:37.627 --> 55:38.948
but she could breathe underwater,

55:39.087 --> 55:41.589
which made her difficult to track.

55:44.092 --> 55:45.552
- She was deadly.
- Shh.

55:46.720 --> 55:48.555
You talk too much.

56:02.277 --> 56:04.446
You're pathetic.

56:06.448 --> 56:07.907
She has guts.

56:08.616 --> 56:11.036
Ooh! I like that.

56:11.119 --> 56:12.245
Aah!

56:12.454 --> 56:15.373
That's going to make me enjoy this
even more.

56:15.957 --> 56:16.958
No!

56:17.042 --> 56:18.877
Well, boys, you can have her,

56:20.378 --> 56:21.379
after I'm done...

56:21.463 --> 56:23.548
No! No!

56:23.631 --> 56:25.175
...If there's anything left.

56:34.684 --> 56:35.685
What

56:36.978 --> 56:37.979
the hell?

56:46.362 --> 56:47.363
No!

57:46.464 --> 57:47.841
Following this road,
you should be able to

57:47.924 --> 57:50.301
make it back to Augsburg by nightfall.

57:50.718 --> 57:51.886
Yeah.

57:52.971 --> 57:54.305
I hope so.

57:55.390 --> 57:57.142
When you find your sister,

57:57.225 --> 57:59.227
could you come back to see me again?

58:01.437 --> 58:03.273
Yes, of course.

58:38.433 --> 58:39.434
Drink.

58:40.268 --> 58:41.269
No.

58:43.771 --> 58:45.899
Drink!

59:22.477 --> 59:24.479
Why did you save me?

59:27.273 --> 59:28.358
Trolls

59:28.900 --> 59:31.402
serve witches.

59:38.326 --> 59:39.661
Hey, wait.

59:41.037 --> 59:42.747
Wait!

59:48.294 --> 59:49.629
What's your name?

59:51.965 --> 59:53.967
Edward.

59:57.720 --> 59:58.763
Edward, wait!

59:59.722 --> 01:00:01.015
Where am I?

01:01:17.592 --> 01:01:18.926
Hansel?

01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:20.136
Gretel?

01:01:20.219 --> 01:01:21.220
Where have you been?

01:01:21.304 --> 01:01:23.097
- Where have you been?

01:01:30.688 --> 01:01:31.856
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:01:31.939 --> 01:01:33.274
Hey, what happened to your face?

01:01:34.859 --> 01:01:36.361
Gretel?

01:01:36.444 --> 01:01:37.528
- Who did this to you?
- I'm okay.

01:01:37.612 --> 01:01:38.613
Who did this to you?

01:01:38.738 --> 01:01:39.739
I'm okay.

01:01:41.783 --> 01:01:43.451
Honey, I'm sorry.

01:01:44.619 --> 01:01:46.120
I'm sorry.

01:01:51.959 --> 01:01:53.294
- You okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:01:53.795 --> 01:01:55.129
I'm okay.

01:02:00.885 --> 01:02:01.803
Where are we?

01:02:03.304 --> 01:02:04.555
I don't know.

01:02:04.639 --> 01:02:05.681
Oh!

01:02:07.558 --> 01:02:08.601
You okay?

01:02:08.684 --> 01:02:10.436
Did you have to land on me?

01:02:14.315 --> 01:02:15.983
What is this place?

01:02:29.831 --> 01:02:31.958
This isn't a regular witch's lair.

01:02:32.041 --> 01:02:33.167
No.

01:02:34.919 --> 01:02:37.255
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:02:48.599 --> 01:02:49.934
Hey, sis?

01:02:52.270 --> 01:02:53.950
I think you're gonna
want to come see this.

01:03:04.949 --> 01:03:07.452
I think this is our old house.

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.955
And this is our old room.

01:03:13.291 --> 01:03:14.750
Here. Look.

01:03:15.543 --> 01:03:16.878
There's your bed.

01:03:17.795 --> 01:03:18.880
Right?

01:03:19.922 --> 01:03:21.007
Ah!

01:03:23.217 --> 01:03:24.510
Remember this?

01:03:30.475 --> 01:03:31.976
I think that's you.

01:03:32.643 --> 01:03:35.313
And some sort of vicious badger.

01:03:41.152 --> 01:03:42.820
Old beds.

01:03:51.996 --> 01:03:53.331
Hansel.

01:03:56.167 --> 01:03:59.170
You ever wonder
what happened to our parents?

01:04:06.302 --> 01:04:08.471
We don't talk about that, Gretel.

01:04:08.596 --> 01:04:10.306
We made a promise, you know that.

01:04:10.515 --> 01:04:12.850
Why do you think
the witches' spells don't work on us?

01:04:12.934 --> 01:04:13.893
Leave it alone.

01:04:13.976 --> 01:04:15.561
- This is our house.
- Yeah?

01:04:15.645 --> 01:04:17.146
This is where we grew up!

01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:19.273
And what does that look like to you?

01:04:19.482 --> 01:04:22.068
I don't know, Gretel.
We grew up over a witch's lair.

01:04:22.151 --> 01:04:23.194
So what? So we're cursed?

01:04:23.277 --> 01:04:25.238
No. I think that our mother was...

01:04:27.698 --> 01:04:32.620
I see you finally found your way
home after all these years.

01:04:33.287 --> 01:04:35.122
Mmm. How very sweet.

01:04:46.175 --> 01:04:48.177
I remember this house.

01:04:48.678 --> 01:04:50.680
The house of Adrianna,

01:04:51.514 --> 01:04:53.766
the Great White Witch.

01:04:55.851 --> 01:04:58.563
Your whore of a mother.

01:05:02.817 --> 01:05:05.278
Let me tell you a little story.

01:05:11.033 --> 01:05:15.204
Once upon a time,
near a shitty little town,

01:05:16.205 --> 01:05:21.002
there was a farmer who fell
in love with a white witch.

01:05:21.711 --> 01:05:24.380
<i>And with their two beautiful children,</i>

01:05:24.714 --> 01:05:27.216
<i>oh, they were so happy.</i>

01:05:28.718 --> 01:05:31.220
<i>But not for long.</i>

01:05:33.556 --> 01:05:37.059
<i>During a Blood Moon, there is a potion</i>

01:05:37.393 --> 01:05:40.229
<i>that will make you immune to fire.</i>

01:05:41.188 --> 01:05:43.566
<i>The key to the potion</i>

01:05:43.649 --> 01:05:47.987
<i>is the heart of a Grand White Witch.</i>

01:05:49.071 --> 01:05:52.992
<i>But your mother,
the most powerful white witch,</i>

01:05:53.075 --> 01:05:55.077
<i>was too strong for us.</i>

01:05:55.745 --> 01:05:58.080
<i>So it had to be you, Gretel.</i>

01:05:58.414 --> 01:06:01.709
<i>It had to be your heart.</i>

01:06:02.627 --> 01:06:06.714
<i>As the Blood Moon approached,
I sent out a little rumor</i>

01:06:07.590 --> 01:06:09.634
<i>to the people of Augsburg.</i>

01:06:10.343 --> 01:06:12.511
<i>And when she knew they were coming,</i>

01:06:12.928 --> 01:06:15.681
<i>she had your father take you
into the forest to hide you.</i>

01:06:15.765 --> 01:06:17.767
- Father! Wait!

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:19.268
Don't let her get away!

01:06:19.352 --> 01:06:21.020
<i>She didn't know what
they would do to her,</i>

01:06:21.103 --> 01:06:23.439
<i>but she was too proud to run.</i>

01:06:23.773 --> 01:06:27.735
<i>And a white witch would never use her
magic against humans.</i>

01:06:29.403 --> 01:06:31.447
<i>When your father came back for her...</i>

01:06:32.657 --> 01:06:33.658
No!

01:06:33.741 --> 01:06:35.534
<i>...they hanged him.</i>

01:06:35.618 --> 01:06:37.787
- Run him up!
- No!

01:06:39.622 --> 01:06:41.957
<i>...right in front</i>

01:06:42.583 --> 01:06:46.253
<i>of your mother's burning flesh!</i>

01:06:53.844 --> 01:06:55.346
<i>Adrianna was gone.</i>

01:06:57.348 --> 01:06:59.600
<i>But so was your heart.</i>

01:07:01.268 --> 01:07:03.938
<i>And the Blood Moon passed.</i>

01:07:04.855 --> 01:07:06.190
The end.

01:07:06.941 --> 01:07:09.819
It's a beautiful story, don't you think?

01:07:10.945 --> 01:07:13.614
They died to save you.

01:07:15.991 --> 01:07:17.201
And all your life,

01:07:17.326 --> 01:07:19.453
how you've hated them.

01:07:19.787 --> 01:07:21.539
Tomorrow

01:07:21.622 --> 01:07:25.042
sisters from all dark corners of the land

01:07:25.251 --> 01:07:28.003
will join me in the light
of the Blood Moon

01:07:28.295 --> 01:07:30.798
for the greatest Sabbath of all.

01:07:31.799 --> 01:07:33.634
The only thing left

01:07:34.593 --> 01:07:36.929
is the everlasting power

01:07:37.304 --> 01:07:38.973
of the heart

01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:41.642
of a Grand White Witch.

01:07:41.726 --> 01:07:42.893
You know, you talk too much.

01:07:53.654 --> 01:07:56.073
Bad move, witch hunter.

01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:03.497
Hansel!

01:08:13.007 --> 01:08:15.509
Drink it. It will help the pain.

01:08:18.679 --> 01:08:19.846
Mina?

01:08:26.353 --> 01:08:27.938
What did you do?

01:08:28.022 --> 01:08:29.523
Mina?

01:08:36.572 --> 01:08:37.907
You're a witch?

01:08:38.115 --> 01:08:40.367
There are good witches in the world.

01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:42.620
- Not many, but some.
- You stay back.

01:08:42.787 --> 01:08:44.205
I'm a witch, but I won't hurt you.

01:08:44.371 --> 01:08:46.582
I checked you. You were...
You were clean.

01:08:46.665 --> 01:08:48.834
Yeah, but only the dark witches
bear the signs.

01:08:48.917 --> 01:08:51.420
Dark witches?
What are you talking about?

01:08:51.545 --> 01:08:52.546
Think about it,

01:08:52.671 --> 01:08:55.674
if their spells don't work on you,
why would mine?

01:08:56.591 --> 01:08:58.260
I'm not like them, Hansel.

01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:04.892
Gretel. Shit.

01:09:06.393 --> 01:09:09.063
- Where are you going?
- They have my sister.

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:10.814
Who has your sister?

01:09:10.898 --> 01:09:12.899
Witches have my sister. They...

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:14.819
- Where?
- They said something

01:09:15.277 --> 01:09:18.404
about a ritual or a gathering.
I don't know.

01:09:18.572 --> 01:09:21.783
There's a place deep in the forest,
nearby the mountains.

01:09:22.076 --> 01:09:25.246
A place dark witches use
for their Sabbath.

01:09:25.371 --> 01:09:26.497
Where is it?

01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:27.581
Hansel, I...

01:09:27.706 --> 01:09:29.124
Mina, how do I get there?

01:09:29.250 --> 01:09:30.960
If there is a Sabbath,
there will be many witches.

01:09:31.042 --> 01:09:33.879
They'll be too powerful.
They'll kill you, Hansel.

01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:36.090
I don't have time for this.

01:09:36.173 --> 01:09:39.676
No, listen, Hansel,
I found something here, in this cave.

01:09:40.261 --> 01:09:44.098
Something very powerful.
Something that could help us.

01:09:44.765 --> 01:09:47.518
The <i>Abramelin Grimoire!</i> It exists!

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.600
This is the book
of protection against black magic.

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:53.524
I can't believe this.
Where did you find it?

01:09:53.607 --> 01:09:55.276
Don't ask, kid.

01:09:55.401 --> 01:09:56.694
If this thing does what it says,

01:09:56.777 --> 01:09:58.529
it will allow us
to penetrate their protection.

01:09:58.612 --> 01:09:59.655
Oh, yeah?

01:09:59.822 --> 01:10:02.491
Their wands won't
protect them anymore.

01:10:02.658 --> 01:10:03.659
We just need something to bless.

01:10:03.826 --> 01:10:06.161
Okay, let's start with this.

01:10:30.769 --> 01:10:32.980
I hope this works.

01:10:36.692 --> 01:10:37.985
All right.

01:10:42.281 --> 01:10:43.532
You ever shoot a gun?

01:10:44.783 --> 01:10:47.286
Well, I did win the county fair

01:10:48.287 --> 01:10:49.747
three times.

01:10:51.457 --> 01:10:53.792
All right. In that case...

01:10:58.130 --> 01:11:00.007
Don't touch the gun.

01:11:16.815 --> 01:11:17.816
Edward.

01:11:19.318 --> 01:11:20.986
What are you doing here?

01:11:23.197 --> 01:11:24.698
What's going on?

01:11:28.661 --> 01:11:30.329
Muriel.

01:11:37.002 --> 01:11:38.379
Edward,

01:11:39.546 --> 01:11:40.714
I need your help.

01:11:45.678 --> 01:11:47.346
Please, Edward.

01:11:50.557 --> 01:11:54.478
- Hey! You filthy oaf!

01:11:54.561 --> 01:11:57.064
Get the children. We're moving out.

01:12:02.027 --> 01:12:04.697
It's time.

01:12:15.082 --> 01:12:16.083
Okay, are we good?

01:12:16.959 --> 01:12:18.127
Yes.

01:12:29.263 --> 01:12:32.850
Well, as far as you go, kid.

01:12:33.767 --> 01:12:36.603
But, I will leave you with this.

01:12:38.772 --> 01:12:40.441
- Wow!
- Find a place to hide.

01:12:40.566 --> 01:12:41.692
Shoot anything that moves.

01:12:43.277 --> 01:12:44.611
Good luck.

01:13:05.966 --> 01:13:07.301
Shut up!

01:13:13.307 --> 01:13:14.308
Oh!

01:13:30.324 --> 01:13:31.700
After tonight,

01:13:32.493 --> 01:13:35.829
no sister will be burned on their pyres!

01:13:37.915 --> 01:13:41.126
No sister will be ashes on the ground!

01:13:41.335 --> 01:13:43.337
I want your brains!

01:13:44.213 --> 01:13:45.214
And now,

01:13:46.507 --> 01:13:49.218
now we feast!

01:13:49.384 --> 01:13:51.678
- That's a lot of witches.

01:13:52.638 --> 01:13:53.639
Okay.

01:13:54.181 --> 01:13:56.225
I'm gonna go down
around the other side.

01:13:56.725 --> 01:13:59.394
Push them into the middle,
get them away from the kids.

01:13:59.853 --> 01:14:02.564
Now, when you see my signal,
you unleash hell.

01:14:02.648 --> 01:14:03.774
Wish me luck.

01:14:03.857 --> 01:14:05.442
Wait. Wait. What's the signal?

01:14:05.526 --> 01:14:09.696
It'll be me blowing one of these
bitches' heads off.

01:14:15.702 --> 01:14:17.121
Yes.

01:14:18.455 --> 01:14:21.333
The hour has come!

01:14:22.543 --> 01:14:25.546
The Blood Moon arrives!

01:14:25.712 --> 01:14:31.343
- The Grand White Witch dies!

01:14:37.683 --> 01:14:42.104
Excuse me! Excuse me, ladies. Hi.

01:14:43.647 --> 01:14:47.151
It seems as if I've lost my invitation
to your little dinner party here.

01:14:47.276 --> 01:14:48.569
I apologize.

01:14:48.694 --> 01:14:51.697
But don't worry.
I didn't come empty-handed.

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.825
Sisters!

01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:01.123
Allow me to introduce you
to the famous witch hunter Hansel.

01:15:02.207 --> 01:15:07.296
Personally responsible for the deaths
of over 600.

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:12.092
Listen to me carefully!

01:15:12.634 --> 01:15:16.138
If you let my sister
and the children go now,

01:15:16.638 --> 01:15:20.142
I'll consider not killing
each and every one of you.

01:15:26.648 --> 01:15:27.649
Enough with this.

01:15:30.694 --> 01:15:32.404
- Take his fucking head off.
- Yes.

01:15:42.289 --> 01:15:43.707
Please work.

01:16:34.633 --> 01:16:38.512
We have to hurry. You get the children.
I'll get her heart!

01:16:38.595 --> 01:16:39.930
Now, move!

01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:58.282
Fucking...

01:17:09.876 --> 01:17:10.877
Eat it!

01:17:20.887 --> 01:17:22.306
Walk!

01:17:22.389 --> 01:17:23.557
Move it!

01:17:29.396 --> 01:17:30.397
Come on!

01:17:30.897 --> 01:17:31.982
- Gretel!

01:17:32.065 --> 01:17:33.191
Ohh!

01:17:37.529 --> 01:17:38.739
Edward.

01:17:39.156 --> 01:17:40.157
Gretel!

01:17:41.199 --> 01:17:43.493
I'm okay! Go get the children!

01:17:45.037 --> 01:17:46.121
Stay still!

01:17:49.166 --> 01:17:51.335
Get off of me!

01:18:11.188 --> 01:18:12.356
No!

01:18:25.243 --> 01:18:26.578
Thank you!

01:18:55.273 --> 01:18:56.608
- Shit!
- Too late.

01:19:05.909 --> 01:19:07.077
Gretel!

01:19:36.356 --> 01:19:37.691
Thank you.

01:19:42.028 --> 01:19:43.530
- You okay?

01:19:43.613 --> 01:19:45.031
Muriel's still alive.

01:19:45.157 --> 01:19:46.741
I'm not done.

01:19:46.825 --> 01:19:48.493
Ah, Gretel, Mina. Mina, Gretel.

01:19:48.577 --> 01:19:50.579
- Hey.
- I need that.

01:19:50.662 --> 01:19:52.263
- Okay.
- She flew off that way.

01:19:55.542 --> 01:19:57.169
Well, where are you going?

01:19:57.252 --> 01:19:58.462
I have to help Edward!

01:19:58.628 --> 01:20:01.882
Edward. Who the fuck's Edward?

01:20:57.938 --> 01:21:00.106
- Ah! Hell, yeah!
- Ben!

01:21:01.650 --> 01:21:03.276
Hansel! Hansel!

01:21:03.485 --> 01:21:05.570
I did it! I shot her! Muriel.

01:21:05.654 --> 01:21:08.657
- Where?
- Uh, I shot her down, over there.

01:21:08.782 --> 01:21:09.950
Good job.

01:21:17.290 --> 01:21:18.792
She's close.

01:21:30.136 --> 01:21:31.555
Edward?

01:22:15.098 --> 01:22:17.392
Oh, you can't be serious.

01:22:30.947 --> 01:22:32.449
Is this...

01:22:32.866 --> 01:22:34.451
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:22:35.368 --> 01:22:36.369
Wow.

01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:40.624
Whatever you do,
don't eat the fucking candy.

01:22:52.552 --> 01:22:54.721
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
Stop right there,

01:22:54.888 --> 01:22:56.890
or the little boy dies.

01:22:58.141 --> 01:23:01.144
I thought it would
be fitting for us to end up here,

01:23:01.478 --> 01:23:03.063
where it all began.

01:23:03.647 --> 01:23:06.107
Kind of lost its charm a little, huh?

01:23:06.733 --> 01:23:07.901
Drop it.

01:23:13.573 --> 01:23:14.574
Good boy.

01:23:16.159 --> 01:23:17.160
Don't worry, kid.

01:23:18.995 --> 01:23:20.235
I'm not gonna let her hurt you.

01:23:20.246 --> 01:23:21.247
Oh, really?

01:23:22.165 --> 01:23:23.416
Really.

01:23:33.677 --> 01:23:35.345
The end is near,

01:23:36.262 --> 01:23:37.472
witch hunter.

01:23:39.516 --> 01:23:44.396
I wish I could say
it would be painless, but that

01:23:45.230 --> 01:23:47.190
would be a lie.

01:23:54.489 --> 01:23:55.573
Get away from him.

01:23:57.075 --> 01:23:59.327
Always funny seeing
a white witch with a wand.

01:24:01.287 --> 01:24:04.207
What are you going to do?
Hit me with your love spell?

01:24:08.086 --> 01:24:09.587
Not bad.

01:24:15.593 --> 01:24:19.097
Sacrificing yourself to save a human.

01:24:19.764 --> 01:24:21.015
Pathetic.

01:24:26.604 --> 01:24:28.356
No!

01:24:34.696 --> 01:24:36.281
Mina. Hey.

01:24:36.823 --> 01:24:38.032
Come here.

01:24:41.953 --> 01:24:43.288
Hansel.

01:24:47.083 --> 01:24:48.084
Hansel.

01:24:48.835 --> 01:24:50.336
I tried to stop her.

01:24:50.587 --> 01:24:52.797
You did. You did good.

01:24:54.257 --> 01:24:55.759
You did good.

01:25:01.264 --> 01:25:04.017
I want you to do something for me.

01:25:05.643 --> 01:25:06.978
Anything.

01:25:11.566 --> 01:25:14.027
Kill the fucking bitch.

01:25:41.638 --> 01:25:43.890
You got to be fucking kidding me.

01:26:49.205 --> 01:26:50.915
Oh, please.

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:52.333
Please?

01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:54.043
Please, stop.

01:26:55.587 --> 01:26:56.921
Please.

01:26:57.046 --> 01:26:58.089
Yeah, nice try.

01:28:03.363 --> 01:28:05.156
I fucking hate you.

01:28:05.823 --> 01:28:09.410
You know, you look like shit.

01:28:09.494 --> 01:28:10.495
You know that?

01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:13.581
- So do you.

01:28:37.605 --> 01:28:38.773
Finish her already.

01:29:06.259 --> 01:29:08.886
<i>Revenge doesn't
change the past.</i>

01:29:13.057 --> 01:29:15.101
<i>It won't bring our parents back.</i>

01:29:15.435 --> 01:29:17.395
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah.

01:29:17.812 --> 01:29:19.480
- Glad to hear it.
- Ow!

01:29:20.148 --> 01:29:21.709
<i>But it sure as hell feels good.</i>

01:29:25.319 --> 01:29:27.739
<i>My sister and I know the truth.</i>

01:29:29.574 --> 01:29:31.576
<i>We know who we are now.</i>

01:29:33.453 --> 01:29:34.871
<i>And so do they.</i>

01:29:37.373 --> 01:29:39.208
<i>They know our story,</i>

01:29:39.959 --> 01:29:41.461
<i>our powers,</i>

01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:43.463
<i>what we can do.</i>

01:29:45.715 --> 01:29:47.383
<i>And they should fear us.</i>

01:29:50.636 --> 01:29:51.679
<i>All of us.</i>

01:29:52.055 --> 01:29:53.973
We should be getting close now.

01:29:54.098 --> 01:29:56.559
And so after this next one,
we've got three more to go.

01:29:56.684 --> 01:30:00.146
Three? You said three more
three witches ago.

01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:02.607
Come on, you always say,
more witches, more money, right?

01:30:02.732 --> 01:30:04.567
Yeah, but you ain't getting any of it.

01:30:04.650 --> 01:30:06.027
Unless you want to pull the cart.

01:30:08.196 --> 01:30:09.655
Right, big guy?

01:30:09.822 --> 01:30:11.022
I told you he'd come in handy.

01:30:12.742 --> 01:30:15.078
<i>There are good witches
in the world.</i>

01:30:15.745 --> 01:30:17.413
<i>We know that now.</i>

01:30:18.247 --> 01:30:21.834
<i>But for the ones practicing
the black arts, beware.</i>

01:30:21.918 --> 01:30:23.628
<i>We're coming for you.</i>

01:30:24.337 --> 01:30:27.173
<i>No matter where you are, we'll find you.</i>

01:30:28.841 --> 01:30:30.593
<i>And dead or alive,</i>

01:30:31.677 --> 01:30:33.054
<i>we'll take you down.</i>

01:30:33.179 --> 01:30:35.848
Edward, want to knock?

01:30:37.725 --> 01:30:39.769
<i>- Dead.</i>

01:31:05.002 --> 01:31:08.381
I hate to break it to you,
but it's not gonna be an open casket.
