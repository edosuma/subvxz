WEBVTT

00:01.380 --> 00:04.073
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.211 --> 00:07.076
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.214 --> 00:11.597
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:11.735 --> 00:14.531
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:14.669 --> 00:17.465
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:17.603 --> 00:21.780
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.299 --> 00:25.715
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:25.853 --> 00:28.683
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.821 --> 00:31.341
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.479 --> 00:33.999
Just to get up that hill

00:34.137 --> 00:36.588
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.726 --> 00:39.211
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.349 --> 00:41.731
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.869 --> 00:43.457
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.595 --> 00:46.253
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.391 --> 00:49.359
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.497 --> 00:53.881
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:54.019 --> 00:56.746
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.884 --> 00:59.852
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.990 --> 01:06.342
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:10.760 --> 01:13.590
Okay, that ought to do it.

01:15.040 --> 01:18.664
"When the mixture
has reached the
proper consistency..."

01:19.079 --> 01:20.183
Aha!

01:20.321 --> 01:21.840
"...check on the duck."

01:22.979 --> 01:24.636
Okay.

01:26.362 --> 01:28.743
Yeah, hello, duck.
How's it going?

01:28.881 --> 01:30.193
Quack, quack, quack!

01:33.990 --> 01:36.993
Florence, for a second
there you had me going.

01:37.131 --> 01:39.582
Mrs. Jefferson, what on earth
are you doing in here?

01:39.720 --> 01:43.103
It's an experiment.
I'm making Chinese food
for dinner.

01:43.241 --> 01:46.554
Peking Duck
and Moo Goo Gai Pan.

01:46.692 --> 01:49.764
Well, you sure used a lot
of pans for just one Moo Goo.

01:52.008 --> 01:53.665
Listen, Mrs. Jefferson,
I'll take over from here.

01:53.803 --> 01:55.874
Why don't you
go out for a while?
Go out?

01:56.012 --> 01:57.220
Yeah, to a movie
or something.

01:57.358 --> 01:59.119
There's a great one
playing right down
the street.

01:59.257 --> 02:02.363
In the first 10 minutes,
five people get crushed
to death in an avalanche.

02:02.501 --> 02:04.400
Seven people get
drowned in a flood.

02:04.538 --> 02:07.092
And one poor dude
in a car wash
gets hot waxed to death.

02:08.887 --> 02:11.303
Florence, I don't wanna
see a movie like that.

02:11.441 --> 02:13.029
Why not?
It's a love story.

02:14.513 --> 02:15.963
Are you trying
to get rid of me?

02:16.101 --> 02:19.415
Of course not!
The first feature starts
in five minutes.

02:19.553 --> 02:21.106
You sure are dressed up.

02:22.176 --> 02:25.766
Oh, so that's why
you want me out of here.

02:25.904 --> 02:27.526
A man's
coming over, right?

02:27.664 --> 02:30.391
Nobody's coming over.
I don't know where
you got that idea.

02:30.529 --> 02:31.979
I'm just trying
to help with dinner.

02:33.187 --> 02:34.188
Oh, I'll get it!

02:35.362 --> 02:37.053
But, Florence!

02:38.227 --> 02:39.849
What about my duck?

02:39.987 --> 02:42.058
Just tell him to keep
his feathers on.
I'll be back in a minute.

02:45.406 --> 02:47.443
Hi, Florence.
Oh, hi, Milly, come on in.

02:47.581 --> 02:49.341
I was just down
in the laundry room,

02:49.479 --> 02:50.618
and I found
one of your flyers

02:50.756 --> 02:52.206
about the union
we were talking about.

02:52.344 --> 02:53.759
Oh, good. Did you make up
your mind to join yet?

02:53.897 --> 02:56.417
Well, not yet.
But the flyers sound great.

02:56.555 --> 02:58.557
"Maids of
the building unite!

02:58.695 --> 03:00.904
"See Florence Johnston
tonight."

03:01.042 --> 03:03.183
Shh! Mrs. Jefferson
will hear you.

03:03.321 --> 03:05.150
She already did.

03:05.288 --> 03:07.221
What are you two trying
to keep so secret?

03:07.359 --> 03:08.809
Oh, nothing.

03:08.947 --> 03:11.363
Oh, come on,
I love secrets.

03:11.501 --> 03:13.952
We can't tell you,
Mrs. Jefferson.
You ain't one of us.

03:18.439 --> 03:22.926
I've got 10 mirrors in
this house that says I am.

03:23.064 --> 03:26.102
I mean, you're one of us,
but you're also
one of them.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.966
Them? Who's them?

03:28.380 --> 03:29.588
You.

03:29.726 --> 03:31.866
Me is them?

03:32.004 --> 03:33.799
Oh, well, you're gonna
find out anyway.

03:34.593 --> 03:36.526
We are trying
to form a union.

03:36.664 --> 03:37.907
You mean, the maids?

03:38.045 --> 03:40.392
Yeah. Cassie Kincaid,
the President of the union,

03:40.530 --> 03:42.325
is supposed to drop by
here this afternoon.

03:42.463 --> 03:44.396
I think
she's gonna make me
head of the building.

03:44.534 --> 03:47.296
Oh, Florence,
that's wonderful!

03:47.434 --> 03:49.539
It's about time
maids had a union.

03:49.677 --> 03:51.748
I'm behind you
all the way.

03:51.886 --> 03:52.922
Well, that's one.

03:53.060 --> 03:54.475
And I'm sure
George is, too.

03:54.613 --> 03:55.821
That's one and a half.

03:58.099 --> 04:00.205
It's sure nice of you
to support the maids.

04:00.343 --> 04:02.725
I wish my boss
felt the way you do.

04:02.863 --> 04:05.141
Well, I used to be
a maid myself.

04:05.279 --> 04:08.386
And believe me, Milly,
I know exactly
where you're at.

04:08.524 --> 04:11.216
So do I. But how do I
get a ticket out of here?

04:11.354 --> 04:13.632
Well, joining the union
would be a good start.

04:13.770 --> 04:16.014
Boy, did I have
a mean boss.

04:16.152 --> 04:18.258
And you know what
made me the maddest?

04:18.396 --> 04:21.778
Every time I'd start
to talk, she'd say,

04:21.916 --> 04:25.334
"You people never know
when to keep
your mouths shut."

04:25.472 --> 04:27.025
Well, why didn't you quit?

04:27.163 --> 04:30.822
Couldn't afford to.
But I did call her names
under my breath,

04:30.960 --> 04:32.306
and make faces
behind her back.

04:33.238 --> 04:34.998
Hey, like I do to
Mr. Jefferson, huh?

04:38.692 --> 04:41.281
Well, I better leave before
my boss starts yelling.

04:41.419 --> 04:43.421
Hey, wait a minute, Milly.
Don't you wanna join?

04:43.559 --> 04:45.561
We got six girls
signed up already.

04:45.699 --> 04:47.873
Oh, Florence, I still
need more time to think.

04:48.011 --> 04:51.187
I mean, what if I get fired?
I got kids in college.

04:51.325 --> 04:53.741
You do?
Yeah. William and Mary.

04:53.879 --> 04:55.260
That's a great school.

04:55.398 --> 04:56.813
No, those are my kids.

04:58.643 --> 05:00.127
They go to City College.

05:00.265 --> 05:03.164
If I lose my job,
they'll have to drop out,
go to work.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.683
It's all right, Milly.
I understand.

05:05.891 --> 05:07.548
Oh, I'll get it.
It's probably Cassie.

05:09.136 --> 05:10.965
Hiya, kid.
What's happening?

05:11.103 --> 05:13.589
Hi, Cassie.
Cassie Kincaid, this is...
Nice to meet you.

05:13.727 --> 05:15.073
And this is...
You too, honey.

05:15.970 --> 05:18.145
Listen, kid,

05:18.283 --> 05:21.390
I've got something
important to ask you,
so listen up!

05:23.806 --> 05:25.842
Peking Duck, right?

05:25.980 --> 05:28.017
Yeah, how did you know?

05:28.155 --> 05:29.984
Honey, I've been
a maid for 21 years.

05:30.122 --> 05:32.953
And if this nose
ain't smelt it,
you better not eat it.

05:35.473 --> 05:37.440
Oh, what did you wanna
ask me, Cassie?

05:37.578 --> 05:39.822
In a minute, kid. I think
this duck needs me first.

05:46.449 --> 05:49.141
Well, let's take
a look at the damage.

05:50.798 --> 05:52.075
Have mercy.

05:53.836 --> 05:56.597
There ought to be a law
against somebody doing
that to a duck.

05:57.943 --> 06:00.567
Um, didn't you wanna ask
me something, Cassie?

06:00.705 --> 06:04.950
Oh, yeah. Kid, the union
needs you to be the head
of this building.

06:05.088 --> 06:08.471
Me? Head of the building?
Oh, I don't know.

06:08.609 --> 06:10.197
Come on, we need
a good leader.

06:10.335 --> 06:13.407
Me? Oh, no, not me.

06:13.545 --> 06:14.926
Well, I guess I can
get someone else.

06:15.064 --> 06:16.341
Over my dead body!

06:18.516 --> 06:19.793
I worked my fanny off
for this union.

06:20.794 --> 06:22.243
Good, then it's settled.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.176
How about you, honey?
You joined up yet?

06:24.314 --> 06:26.351
I can't.
I'm Florence's employer.

06:26.489 --> 06:28.491
You mean, you're management?

06:28.629 --> 06:31.321
But I'm on your side.
I used to be a maid myself.

06:31.460 --> 06:33.323
Well, in that case,
baste your own duck.

06:35.843 --> 06:37.500
Hey, Weez, I'm home!

06:37.638 --> 06:39.191
LOUISE: In the
kitchen, George.

06:39.329 --> 06:41.849
Get ready for some sugar,
'cause here I come.

06:43.713 --> 06:46.785
Just wrap your arms around
my neck and lay one on me.

06:50.030 --> 06:51.825
A little friendly,
aren't you, shorty?

06:53.378 --> 06:55.207
Who the hell are you?
Cassie Kincaid!

06:55.345 --> 06:57.244
Weezy, what are all these
people doing in my kitchen?

06:57.382 --> 06:59.349
These are friends
of Florence's, George.

06:59.488 --> 07:01.351
The maids are gonna
form a union.

07:01.490 --> 07:04.838
That's right. And I have just
been appointed President

07:04.976 --> 07:08.945
of the United Sisterhood
of Household Technicians.

07:09.083 --> 07:10.775
Local Number Two.

07:10.913 --> 07:14.123
I thought you had to work
before you could join
a union?

07:16.263 --> 07:19.300
It's no joke, George.
This union's for real.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.337
A maids union?
Are you kidding?

07:21.475 --> 07:23.719
What's your slogan?
"Have mop, will slop."

07:27.516 --> 07:29.725
Look, shorty,
you'd better quiet down,

07:29.863 --> 07:33.245
unless you want a picket line
walking across your face.

07:33.383 --> 07:36.214
Now watch it. You know,
that's the second time
you done call me "shorty".

07:36.352 --> 07:39.459
Only 'cause
you ain't grown none
since the first time!

07:44.602 --> 07:47.294
Look, kid, I want you
to get all the girls
together in this building,

07:47.432 --> 07:49.192
and have a meeting
tomorrow night.

07:49.330 --> 07:50.573
And you can have it
right here.

07:50.711 --> 07:52.195
Oh, no, they can't.

07:52.333 --> 07:55.060
I ain't gonna have no
bunch of cleaning women
dirtying up my house.

07:55.198 --> 07:58.305
Don't be silly, George.
There's no reason why
they can't have it here!

07:58.443 --> 07:59.755
Right on, honey!

07:59.893 --> 08:01.135
Uh, I've got to run now.

08:01.273 --> 08:03.621
I better go, too.
Can I drop you off, girl?

08:03.759 --> 08:06.037
No, thanks.
I just work upstairs
at the Whittendales.

08:06.175 --> 08:08.833
Mr. Whittendale? The guy
who owns this building?
Yeah.

08:08.971 --> 08:12.388
Oh. So you're
Mr. Whittendale's maid, huh?

08:12.526 --> 08:14.010
I should have known.

08:14.148 --> 08:15.943
You got a lot more class
than the rest of the
maids in this building.

08:17.151 --> 08:19.533
Thank you.
And you support this
union, too, huh?

08:19.671 --> 08:20.707
Well, I... I don't
know about...

08:20.845 --> 08:22.536
Why else do you think
she's here?

08:23.226 --> 08:24.262
And I think it's great.

08:24.400 --> 08:25.470
People should stick up
for themselves.

08:25.608 --> 08:27.507
He sure does change
his mind fast.

08:27.645 --> 08:29.267
There ain't that much
to change, honey.

08:30.993 --> 08:33.582
So look, you just
tell Mr. Whittendale
that his old buddy,

08:33.720 --> 08:36.964
George Jefferson,
is behind them all the way
with this union thing.

08:37.102 --> 08:38.759
And you all can meet
here anytime.

08:38.897 --> 08:40.727
Well, all right!

08:40.865 --> 08:43.971
Listen, I have got to split.
Good luck with your meeting
tomorrow night, kid.

08:44.109 --> 08:45.525
And, honey,
nice meeting you.

08:46.767 --> 08:50.875
As for you, shorty,
you just got
a little taller.

08:51.013 --> 08:52.635
Well, you sure ain't
gettin' no prettier.

08:57.985 --> 09:01.057
Well, George, you certainly
switch sides awful quick.

09:01.195 --> 09:03.197
Yeah. How come you're on
our side all of a sudden?

09:03.335 --> 09:04.992
What difference
does it make?

09:05.130 --> 09:07.098
You should be lucky
me and Mr. Whittendale
respect working people.

09:07.236 --> 09:11.827
Mr. Whittendale. The way
you carry on about that
man is just ridiculous.

09:11.965 --> 09:14.277
No, it ain't, Weezy.
Look, Whittendale's
a big wheel in this town.

09:14.415 --> 09:17.626
Now look, if I get next
to a big wheel, you know
what that makes me?

09:17.764 --> 09:18.799
A hubcap?

09:22.078 --> 09:23.563
You just don't understand.

09:26.082 --> 09:29.845
Hey, Miller! All the
Whittendale people are
coming down here to visit.

09:29.983 --> 09:31.260
Hey, Weezy,
you remember old Miller?

09:31.398 --> 09:33.158
Mr. Whittendale's
right hand man.

09:33.296 --> 09:34.850
Oh, certainly.
How are you?

09:34.988 --> 09:36.679
Hey, how's it going, Miller?
What can I do for you?

09:36.817 --> 09:38.439
You can get off my foot.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.856
Oh! Oh, sorry!

09:40.994 --> 09:42.858
Hey, so, how about
a drink or something?

09:42.996 --> 09:47.172
No, thank you. The only
reason I'm here is to inquire
about this union thing.

09:47.310 --> 09:49.140
Oh, yeah,
it's gonna be big.

09:49.278 --> 09:51.798
Uh, Mr. Whittendale would
like to know exactly
how you feel about it.

09:51.936 --> 09:54.110
I'm behind it
all the way, just like
Mr. Whittendale.

09:54.248 --> 09:57.527
I mean, these hard working
ladies have needed a union
for a long time.

09:57.666 --> 09:59.944
They deserve a union.
They demand a union.

10:00.082 --> 10:01.877
And they got
a right to a union.

10:02.015 --> 10:03.188
But I could be wrong.

10:06.882 --> 10:08.262
Mr. Whittendale
is against it.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.024
Anybody in
their right mind
would be against it!

10:11.162 --> 10:13.785
Mr. Whittendale will
be glad to hear that
you agree with him.

10:13.923 --> 10:16.961
Because he doesn't intend
to allow any such activity
in this building.

10:17.099 --> 10:18.479
Understood?
Mmm-hmm. Yep.

10:18.618 --> 10:19.929
Well, look, don't you
worry about a thing.

10:20.067 --> 10:22.587
George Jefferson
will nip this union thing
right in the bud,

10:22.725 --> 10:24.416
so you can go back and
tell Mr. Whittendale that.

10:24.554 --> 10:26.902
I will. As soon as
you get off my foot!

10:28.213 --> 10:29.836
Goodbye, Mrs. Jefferson.

10:32.873 --> 10:35.013
Well, Weez, that's that.

10:35.151 --> 10:37.084
You ain't having
your meeting here.

10:37.222 --> 10:39.880
Now just
a minute, George...
No.

10:40.018 --> 10:40.985
But you said
that we could...

10:41.123 --> 10:42.711
I know what I said!
I heard me!

10:44.471 --> 10:46.646
And you ain't having
no meeting here,
and that is final!

10:55.309 --> 10:57.311
George, you can't
cancel the meeting.

10:57.449 --> 10:59.141
This union means
too much to Florence.

10:59.279 --> 11:01.971
Forget about it, Weezy.
I got more important
things to do.

11:02.109 --> 11:03.835
Mr. Jefferson, now what
could be more important

11:03.973 --> 11:06.079
than getting
decent working conditions
for us girls?

11:06.217 --> 11:08.495
Girls? What girls?

11:08.633 --> 11:11.878
That group's got more
mileage on it than a fleet
of Model T Fords.

11:13.396 --> 11:15.157
But, Mr. Jefferson,
we need this union.

11:15.295 --> 11:17.987
To get things
like health insurance
and pension plans.

11:18.125 --> 11:21.577
Why? Us poor employers
don't get
that kind of stuff.

11:21.715 --> 11:23.786
Who's gonna take care
of me when I get old?

11:23.924 --> 11:27.169
Keep it up, George, and
you won't have to worry
about getting old.

11:28.618 --> 11:30.103
Look, Weezy...

11:30.241 --> 11:32.001
Mr. Jefferson, do you
know that some of the
maids in this building

11:32.139 --> 11:33.485
don't even
get enough to eat?

11:33.623 --> 11:35.108
Well, that sure
ain't your problem.

11:35.246 --> 11:37.386
I ain't seen no leftovers
since you moved in here.

11:39.664 --> 11:42.978
Come on, George,
now you've got to let them
have that meeting.

11:43.116 --> 11:46.119
Look, Weezy,
the answer is no.
Case is closed.

11:46.257 --> 11:48.190
Well, I'm not through
talking about it.

11:48.328 --> 11:50.123
Well, that's too bad,
'cause I'm through
hearing about it.

11:53.851 --> 11:55.749
George, don't you
dare do that to me.

11:55.887 --> 11:57.786
I can't hear you, Weez,
I'm singing.

11:59.339 --> 12:02.204
Oh, I give up.

12:02.342 --> 12:05.276
Listen, Mr. Jefferson,
now some of the girls
really need a union...

12:07.174 --> 12:10.074
They ain't lucky enough to
work for nice people like
Mrs. Jefferson and you.

12:11.972 --> 12:13.077
Can't hear you.

12:14.975 --> 12:16.874
You chump.
I heard that.

12:18.427 --> 12:19.704
Good.

12:19.842 --> 12:21.568
And you still ain't gonna
have your meeting here.

12:26.849 --> 12:28.057
What am I gonna do,
Mrs. Jefferson?

12:28.195 --> 12:30.680
They're all coming over
here tomorrow night.

12:30.819 --> 12:33.511
Then we have to think
of a way to get
rid of George.

12:34.719 --> 12:35.858
Give me that phone.

12:39.724 --> 12:40.794
You calling a hit man?

12:45.661 --> 12:48.215
Hello, Tom? Louise.

12:48.353 --> 12:53.255
Listen, I've got a big
favor to ask of you for
tomorrow night. Now...

12:54.359 --> 12:55.602
When is he gonna leave,
Mrs. Jefferson?

12:55.740 --> 12:57.328
The girls will be
here pretty soon.

12:58.191 --> 13:00.124
George, will you hurry up?

13:00.262 --> 13:03.506
Tom's probably downstairs
getting a cab right now.

13:03.644 --> 13:06.268
Hold your horses, Weezy.
I had to get my binoculars.

13:06.406 --> 13:09.374
It sure was nice
of Tom to invite you
to the big fight tonight.

13:09.512 --> 13:12.619
Yeah. I can't wait
to see my man
Sugar Ray Jackson, boy.

13:12.757 --> 13:15.795
He reminds me of myself
when I was boxing
in the Navy.

13:15.933 --> 13:18.349
You mean, he gets
knocked out all the time?

13:19.833 --> 13:21.248
Should be
a great fight, Weezy.

13:21.386 --> 13:22.905
Even makes it worth
going with Willis.

13:23.043 --> 13:24.562
Yeah, well, here.
Let's go...

13:24.700 --> 13:26.391
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I gotta adjust
my binoculars.

13:28.359 --> 13:30.568
Oh, yeah!

13:31.811 --> 13:35.021
What an unusual place
for a birth mark.

13:37.023 --> 13:40.612
George, Tom did a nice
thing for you, and I'm
not gonna let you be late.

13:40.750 --> 13:42.028
Hold it, hold it,
hold it, Weezy.

13:42.166 --> 13:43.857
I can't go to no fight
without my lucky boxing hat.

13:47.136 --> 13:49.138
He ain't never gonna
leave, Mrs. Jefferson.

13:49.276 --> 13:51.071
Oh, stop
worrying, Florence.

13:51.209 --> 13:52.624
They're not gonna be here
for half an hour.

13:52.762 --> 13:54.937
There's still
plenty of time.

13:56.007 --> 13:57.250
Oh, no, there ain't.

13:57.388 --> 13:59.355
Hi, Florence.
Hey, sugar,
how are you doing?

14:00.356 --> 14:03.325
What are you all doing here?
You're early.

14:03.463 --> 14:06.535
We thought
we'd help you clean up
before the people got here.

14:06.673 --> 14:08.261
But you are the people.

14:09.779 --> 14:11.816
Florence, do something
and do it fast!

14:11.954 --> 14:13.300
Are you new here, honey?

14:13.438 --> 14:15.889
I haven't seen you
in the laundry room.

14:16.027 --> 14:17.097
I live here.

14:17.235 --> 14:20.411
How about that?
The Jeffersons
got two maids!

14:21.791 --> 14:23.310
Is that Willis?
Tell him I'm coming.

14:23.448 --> 14:26.279
Oh, my God! Quick!
Get them all in
the powder room.

14:26.417 --> 14:27.763
Move it, move it,
come on, girls.

14:27.901 --> 14:29.006
Weezy, I don't wanna be
late 'cause this is...

14:29.144 --> 14:30.352
Oh, George...
Hey, wait, hold it.

14:30.490 --> 14:32.388
Oh, please, you know
how lonesome I get
without you.

14:32.526 --> 14:33.665
Weezy, what is
wrong with you?

14:33.803 --> 14:35.875
Oh, stay here, George.
Hug me, just like this.

14:36.013 --> 14:38.463
I'm not holding you.
You're holding me.
Now let go!

14:38.601 --> 14:41.018
George, is it gonna kill you
to spend some time with me?

14:41.156 --> 14:42.985
It might!
You're breaking my ribs.

14:44.193 --> 14:45.954
Those things
are all put away
in the bathroom now.

14:46.092 --> 14:47.817
Well, what are you
waiting for, George?

14:47.956 --> 14:49.958
You're gonna be late
for the fight.

14:50.096 --> 14:51.338
Have you gone crazy?

14:51.476 --> 14:52.995
Look, as soon as the
business lightens up,

14:53.133 --> 14:54.824
me and you are gonna take
a little vacation, okay?

14:54.963 --> 14:57.689
Oh, sure, George.
Okay, have a good time.

14:57.827 --> 14:59.795
Oh, that was close.

15:01.176 --> 15:03.040
Okay, the coast is clear.

15:03.178 --> 15:04.731
Well, it's about time!

15:06.250 --> 15:07.665
Hey, Weezy,
I forgot my...

15:07.803 --> 15:09.046
Oh, George!
Hey!

15:11.772 --> 15:14.534
GEORGE: Hey, hey! Hey!

15:14.672 --> 15:18.296
Oh, hello, George.
Was that you out there?

15:18.434 --> 15:20.609
What's the big idea slamming
the door in my face?

15:21.782 --> 15:25.062
I didn't do it.
It must have been the wind.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.857
Oh, the wind, huh?
Well, look here,
I forgot my coat.

15:27.996 --> 15:30.550
Would you mind passing it
to me before another wind
comes up?

15:30.688 --> 15:33.104
Oh, sure. Here you go.

15:33.242 --> 15:34.899
Thank you. Lord!

15:36.901 --> 15:38.489
Okay, you all
can come out now.

15:38.627 --> 15:41.147
Is this some kind of
game we're playing?

15:42.665 --> 15:44.633
I hope you won't
be angry, Florence.

15:44.771 --> 15:48.223
I didn't have anything
to do in there,
so I cleaned the sink.

15:49.845 --> 15:52.158
Hi, Milly. I see you finally
decided to join.

15:52.296 --> 15:54.470
I still can't make up
my mind, Florence,

15:54.608 --> 15:56.507
but I wanna hear what
everyone has to say.

15:56.645 --> 15:58.509
Can I stay and listen?
Of course you can.

15:58.647 --> 16:00.511
What about me, Florence?
Sure, come on.

16:05.136 --> 16:07.104
Okay, now quiet down!

16:07.967 --> 16:09.899
Now we're not here
to goof off.

16:10.038 --> 16:12.178
You can do that
on your boss' time.

16:13.351 --> 16:16.423
Girls, please.
Come on, girls!

16:16.561 --> 16:18.701
Okay, put a lid on it.

16:22.567 --> 16:23.672
Go ahead, honey.

16:25.260 --> 16:29.747
Okay, now you all know
why we're here,
to organize our union.

16:29.885 --> 16:31.645
Now starting tonight,
we ain't maids.

16:31.783 --> 16:34.062
We're Household Technicians.

16:34.855 --> 16:37.065
What's
a household technician?

16:37.203 --> 16:40.033
That's a maid
with a union, honey.

16:40.171 --> 16:44.106
I'm all for it. It's about
time we were treated
like professionals.

16:44.244 --> 16:47.972
MAID: Right.
My boss treats me like
a piece of furniture.

16:48.110 --> 16:50.561
He dresses me to match
the tablecloth.

16:53.357 --> 16:56.049
Mr. McGuire does
the same thing to me.

16:56.187 --> 16:58.534
You work for Mr. McGuire?
Yeah.

16:58.672 --> 17:02.055
He's been having an affair
with my boss, Mrs. Albright.

17:05.231 --> 17:06.715
How'd you know about that?

17:06.853 --> 17:10.063
'Cause I'm always
finding his underwear
in her laundry.

17:12.341 --> 17:14.792
Hey, come on, girls.
Now stop gossiping.

17:14.930 --> 17:16.794
It don't make no difference
who sleeps where.

17:16.932 --> 17:18.658
You gotta make
all the beds anyhow.

17:20.453 --> 17:24.353
Florence is right.
We're supposed to be
airing our grievances.

17:24.491 --> 17:25.458
You got
a grievance, Milly?

17:25.596 --> 17:27.115
No. I gotta go
to the bathroom.

17:28.599 --> 17:32.361
I got a grievance.
I'm tired of being
given old clothes,

17:32.499 --> 17:34.294
like it's some kind
of big favor.

17:34.432 --> 17:38.954
Amen to that. Just give me
the money, honey, and I can
pick out my own clothes.

17:39.092 --> 17:40.887
Yeah, how about
a decent salary?

17:41.025 --> 17:44.201
I only get $70 a week,
plus carfare.

17:44.339 --> 17:49.206
I only get one day off
a week. But it's never
on the weekend.

17:49.344 --> 17:52.830
Let's face it. We have
been getting a raw deal.

17:52.968 --> 17:54.625
We've been used.
We've been exploited.

17:54.763 --> 17:56.730
We've been persecuted.
We've been victimized.

17:56.868 --> 17:58.732
Down with the bosses!

18:01.804 --> 18:02.805
Sit down, honey.

18:02.943 --> 18:04.152
You are one
of the bosses.

18:04.290 --> 18:06.602
Oh, I'm sorry,
I got carried away.

18:08.328 --> 18:10.365
I got another grievance.

18:10.503 --> 18:12.194
My boss doesn't trust me.

18:12.332 --> 18:14.955
He always marks the outside
of the Scotch bottle.

18:15.542 --> 18:16.612
That is terrible.

18:16.750 --> 18:18.994
Yeah. It's a good thing
I drink Bourbon.

18:22.687 --> 18:26.760
Well, I'm fed up.
And it's about time
we stop belly aching

18:26.898 --> 18:28.797
and start taking some
action around here.

18:28.935 --> 18:30.661
Right. What kind of action?

18:30.799 --> 18:35.010
I got it. Every morning
let's burn their toast.
Oh!

18:35.148 --> 18:36.977
Oh, that ain't no action.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.428
All right, then,
let's burn our bras.

18:39.566 --> 18:41.361
Yeah!

18:41.499 --> 18:45.124
Uh-uh, we can't do that.
We might burn
the building down.

18:46.918 --> 18:50.025
No, now, now if we're
gonna be a union,
we got to do this official.

18:50.163 --> 18:52.061
Let's draw up
a list of demands.

18:52.200 --> 18:55.479
That's a good idea.
What about two weeks'
paid vacation

18:55.617 --> 18:58.033
like every other worker
in the country?
ALL: Right on!

18:58.171 --> 19:00.932
Time and a half
for overtime.
ALL: Right on!

19:01.070 --> 19:03.418
Paid sick days.
ALL: Right on!

19:08.250 --> 19:09.631
ALL: Right on!

19:18.881 --> 19:20.849
George, what are
you doing back?

19:20.987 --> 19:23.817
Sugar Ray lost. One punch
and the fight was all over.

19:23.955 --> 19:26.579
Already? You couldn't have
gone to a fight that fast.

19:26.717 --> 19:29.444
I didn't.
I heard it on the radio.
We didn't get out of the cab.

19:29.582 --> 19:31.687
The guy threw one punch,
Sugar Ray threw in the towel.

19:31.825 --> 19:34.173
I threw in my tickets.
The cab driver threw it
in reverse.

19:34.311 --> 19:36.934
And all that
took two minutes
and cost me $45.

19:37.072 --> 19:38.832
Oh, that's a shame.
Maybe...

19:38.970 --> 19:40.248
Hey! Hey!

19:42.905 --> 19:43.837
What are you holding here?

19:43.975 --> 19:45.184
A bake off?

19:46.426 --> 19:48.325
This is a union meeting.

19:48.463 --> 19:50.361
Did you say
a union meeting?

19:50.499 --> 19:54.538
That's right.
You better clean out the wax,
'cause I don't do ears.

19:56.125 --> 19:57.920
You know how to use
a broom?
Of course.

19:58.058 --> 20:00.406
Good. Then hop on yours
and fly out of here!

20:04.375 --> 20:07.344
Now I told Mr. Whittendale
there wasn't gonna be
no union meetings here.

20:07.482 --> 20:10.347
Hey, who's this guy?
One of Whittendale's goons?

20:10.485 --> 20:12.625
That's right. I know
Mr. Whittendale personally.

20:12.763 --> 20:14.592
Oh, George,
you've never met him.

20:14.730 --> 20:16.284
ALL: I'll get it!

20:16.422 --> 20:19.528
Sit down! This is
my house, I'll get it!

20:22.359 --> 20:23.946
Yeah, what do you want?

20:24.084 --> 20:27.467
You must be Jefferson.
I've heard a lot about you.

20:27.605 --> 20:30.677
Yeah, well, you must
not be nobody, 'cause I ain't
heard nothing about you.

20:31.333 --> 20:33.818
I am H.L. Whittendale.

20:33.956 --> 20:36.338
Oh, Mr. Whittendale!
Of course!

20:36.476 --> 20:37.684
Hey, that was just
one of my little jokes.

20:37.822 --> 20:41.309
Come on in. Ain't nobody
more somebody than you.

20:42.206 --> 20:44.691
Ah! The doorman was right.

20:45.692 --> 20:47.038
What's going on, Jefferson?

20:47.176 --> 20:48.661
Miller told me
you assured him

20:48.799 --> 20:50.594
the maids
weren't going to have
a union meeting here.

20:50.732 --> 20:52.423
That's what
I was just telling them.
They were just leaving.

20:52.561 --> 20:53.597
Yeah.

20:53.735 --> 20:55.909
Well, let me get
a good look at them.

20:56.047 --> 20:58.947
I wanna know who all
the rabble rousers are.

21:01.190 --> 21:05.609
We ain't rabble rousers.
We're just trying to get
our fair share.

21:05.747 --> 21:07.127
And who might you be?

21:07.266 --> 21:08.957
I might be Florence.

21:10.924 --> 21:13.513
Oh, yes.
The Jefferson maid.

21:13.651 --> 21:16.620
Not maid.
Household Technician.

21:18.725 --> 21:20.348
Florence, why don't you take
the rest of the night off?

21:20.486 --> 21:23.523
Milly! You're here, too?

21:23.661 --> 21:25.422
Didn't I forbid you
to join this union?

21:25.560 --> 21:27.596
Well, I didn't join,
Mr. Whittendale, honest.

21:27.734 --> 21:30.737
I'm just visiting friends.
Now listen, Milly...

21:30.875 --> 21:33.188
Milly is right.
She didn't join.

21:33.326 --> 21:35.432
There you go again.
Who asked you?

21:35.570 --> 21:37.675
Well, ain't that a blip?

21:41.196 --> 21:44.682
Mr. Whittendale, are you
really being fair?

21:44.820 --> 21:48.272
Maybe if you sat down and
talked with the ladies...

21:48.410 --> 21:50.516
Why would I ever do that?

21:51.862 --> 21:53.898
That's right, Weezy,
he's a very busy man.

21:54.036 --> 21:55.935
Well, it wouldn't
hurt to listen!

21:56.073 --> 21:58.869
Look, you stay
out of this!

21:59.007 --> 22:01.768
You people never know when
to keep your mouths shut!

22:01.906 --> 22:05.600
Now wait a minute!
That's my wife
you're talking to!

22:05.738 --> 22:07.843
Now it's bad enough
you done fat mouth
my maid.

22:07.981 --> 22:09.914
Household Technician!

22:14.056 --> 22:17.301
But nobody,
and I mean nobody,
talks to Louise like that!

22:17.439 --> 22:20.269
Especially no stuffed
shirt honkey like you!

22:24.412 --> 22:27.587
I've had enough of this!
Milly, are you coming,

22:27.725 --> 22:30.521
or staying here
with your friends?

22:31.660 --> 22:33.490
I got two kids in college.

22:34.663 --> 22:36.355
One more thing, Jefferson.

22:36.493 --> 22:39.910
I hope you realize
I hold the leases
on your apartment,

22:40.048 --> 22:41.912
and your store!

22:42.050 --> 22:43.603
And I pay the rent!

22:43.741 --> 22:45.881
And if Florence and
her union wanna have
their meetings here,

22:46.019 --> 22:47.607
they can have it
anytime they want!

22:49.816 --> 22:51.611
And when the union
gets too big
for my apartment,

22:51.749 --> 22:52.957
they can have it
in the store!

22:54.787 --> 22:56.444
Are you quite finished?

22:56.582 --> 22:58.929
Not quite! Get out!
What?

22:59.067 --> 23:02.519
You heard me! Let the
doorknob hit you where
the good Lord split you!

23:08.835 --> 23:10.906
Right on, Mr. Jefferson!

23:13.115 --> 23:14.876
MAID: Mr. Jefferson,
you're a doll!

23:36.311 --> 23:39.245
I told off H.L. Whittendale!
I must have been crazy!

23:39.383 --> 23:41.005
He'll probably never
talk to me again.

23:41.143 --> 23:43.870
He never talked
to you before.

23:44.008 --> 23:45.251
Well, he didn't
know me before.

23:45.389 --> 23:46.908
Now he ain't gonna talk
to me on purpose.

23:47.046 --> 23:48.323
That shouldn't
upset you, George.

23:48.461 --> 23:50.912
Most people don't
talk to you on purpose.

23:52.465 --> 23:54.743
Ooh, I just can't get
over it, Mr. Jefferson.

23:54.881 --> 23:56.262
Florence...

23:56.400 --> 23:58.264
You sure told
Mr. Whittendale where to go.
Florence...

23:58.402 --> 23:59.645
And how to get there!

23:59.783 --> 24:01.094
Florence!

24:01.232 --> 24:02.751
And not to come back!

24:02.889 --> 24:04.201
Florence!

24:05.029 --> 24:06.341
Well, good night, y'all.

24:06.479 --> 24:08.930
Oh, let the
doorknob hit you...

24:09.068 --> 24:10.414
I know the rest.

24:10.552 --> 24:13.037
Child, you're a mess!

24:13.175 --> 24:15.937
I've got it, Weezy.
I'm gonna write Whittendale
a letter and apologize.

24:16.075 --> 24:17.973
George, you shouldn't
have to apologize.

24:18.111 --> 24:19.768
You just told him
what you thought.

24:19.906 --> 24:22.184
At least he knows
you're an honest man.

24:22.322 --> 24:23.876
Yeah, I'll go along
with that.

24:24.014 --> 24:25.774
Here, take this down.

24:25.912 --> 24:28.674
"Dear Mr. Whittendale,
you may not believe this,

24:28.812 --> 24:31.504
"but there's this
little guy going around
impersonating me."

24:52.318 --> 24:56.460
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.
