NARRATOR: Three weeks ago,
a dome crashed on Chester's Mill,

00:06.548 --> 00:08.413
cutting us off
from the rest of the world.

00:09.176 --> 00:10.461
The dome has tested our limits,

00:11.178 --> 00:14.090
forcing each of us
to confront our own personal demons:

Rage.

- My God.

00:23.315 --> 00:24.430
Now in order to survive,

00:24.608 --> 00:27.520

our most dangerous adversary:

He killed Angie.

that was kicked up into orbit,
