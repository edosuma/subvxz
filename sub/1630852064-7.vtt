WEBVTT

00:06.256 --> 00:08.091
.

00:08.174 --> 00:10.760
Growing up, this was a place
that we all knew about.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.637
We have some unfinished business.

00:12.721 --> 00:16.975
150 people lost their lives on site.

00:17.058 --> 00:19.728
It's standing there all on its own

00:19.811 --> 00:23.106
and it looks lonely and sad
and haunted.

00:23.189 --> 00:26.609
Spooky time starts now.

00:26.693 --> 00:29.154
You can tell when something's
about to happen.

00:29.237 --> 00:31.823
You can feel it. All of a sudden,
the air changes.

00:31.906 --> 00:34.909
My stomach is starting to hurt.
(GROANS)

00:34.993 --> 00:38.288
I do know there is a very large man
in that room.

00:38.371 --> 00:41.708
The name he's been given The Joker.
(CUP SMASHES)

00:41.791 --> 00:43.960
Very, very tall.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.795
I think the REM Pod just went off.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.298
He likes scaring the hell
out of people.

00:50.133 --> 00:52.302
My name is Dakota Laden.

00:52.385 --> 00:56.014
I'm leading my sister
and two best friends on a road trip,

00:56.097 --> 00:59.184
exploring the most haunted locations
in America.

00:59.267 --> 01:01.478
(SCREAMS) Oh, my God.

01:04.189 --> 01:05.315
Oh, dude!

01:06.608 --> 01:09.069
Go, go, go, go, go.
I'm freaked out.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.237
Experimenting with fear

01:11.321 --> 01:14.616
and how it affects our interaction
with the paranormal.

01:14.699 --> 01:17.577
Each night
we separate and sleep alone.

01:17.660 --> 01:22.290
The catch is only one of us knows
where we're going.

01:50.151 --> 01:51.945
OK, so...

01:52.028 --> 01:53.822
the others have had their turn,

01:53.905 --> 01:56.366
but I am now officially
back in control

01:56.449 --> 01:57.992
for the rest of the trip.

01:58.076 --> 02:01.705
I have selected a haunted location
that is close to home.

02:01.788 --> 02:04.958
This is just a four-hour drive
from where we all grew up.

02:05.041 --> 02:07.252
And just six years ago,

02:07.335 --> 02:10.213
Alex and I actually attempted
to explore it.

02:10.296 --> 02:13.258
Hi. We're driving to Iowa

02:13.341 --> 02:17.262
to stay in a haunted, abandoned
insane asylum for a whole night.

02:17.345 --> 02:18.722
This is weird.

02:21.558 --> 02:25.520
This place is freakin' creepy.
And cold. And huge.

02:26.479 --> 02:28.815
(INDISTINCT)

02:28.898 --> 02:30.984
What the fuck?

02:31.067 --> 02:33.069
OK, no, we're going back.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.655
We chickened out.
We actually didn't last

02:35.739 --> 02:39.034
more than an hour and a half in the
building before we got too scared.

02:39.117 --> 02:41.745
Now that we have a couple of road
trips of experience

02:41.828 --> 02:43.621
under our belts, I really do think

02:43.705 --> 02:46.583
this is the perfect time
to try and tackle a fear

02:46.666 --> 02:48.418
that conquered us as teenagers.

02:51.087 --> 02:54.841
Protruding from the open country
of Monticello, Iowa

02:54.924 --> 02:59.554
stands a menacing and horrifyingly
haunted poor farm.

02:59.637 --> 03:02.724
Open for over 150 years,

03:02.807 --> 03:06.311
it was meant to be a haven
for society's unwanted.

03:06.394 --> 03:10.190
But the caretakers adopted
a blatant indifference

03:10.273 --> 03:12.609
towards the residents' health
and hygiene.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.527
The facility was so bad

03:14.611 --> 03:18.656
that a resident jumped out of
a second-storey window to escape,

03:18.740 --> 03:21.701
while others resorted to
drinking poison

03:21.785 --> 03:23.036
to end their suffering.

03:23.119 --> 03:25.872
And tragically, 150 people

03:25.955 --> 03:28.166
lost their lives on site.

03:28.249 --> 03:30.377
Many of those lost souls

03:30.460 --> 03:33.421
are still trapped within the walls
of the facility today.

03:33.630 --> 03:36.883
While most of the spirits
who still reside are gentle,

03:36.966 --> 03:39.427
people I've spoken with
have warned me

03:39.511 --> 03:42.639
about a terrifying poltergeist
in the basement

03:42.722 --> 03:45.392
that may just push us
to our breaking point.

03:45.475 --> 03:49.646
That alone is more than enough reason
for me to go back.

03:49.729 --> 03:52.315
I want to go down into the basement
with everyone

03:52.399 --> 03:54.192
and try to get to the bottom of this.

04:02.951 --> 04:05.286
I'm back in control.
How does that make you feel?

04:05.370 --> 04:07.455
Just like this.
You SHOULD feel that way

04:07.539 --> 04:10.125
cos you guys have put me through hell
on this road trip.

04:10.208 --> 04:13.003
and I will be returning the favour.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.879
We are heading to Iowa,

04:14.963 --> 04:18.842
and this is a location that is
pretty dang close to our home

04:18.925 --> 04:21.469
where we grew up. And it just kinda
brings me back.

04:21.553 --> 04:24.305
It kinda reminds me of us all
growing up together

04:24.389 --> 04:27.684
and just kind of our earlier years
when we first started

04:27.767 --> 04:29.227
diving into the paranormal.

04:29.310 --> 04:31.855
That better not be the hint,
that it's close to home.

04:31.938 --> 04:34.983
There is one specific part
of this place we're going to

04:35.066 --> 04:38.278
that is rampant
with poltergeist activity.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.822
Oh, great (!) Seriously?

04:40.905 --> 04:43.742
You know that that's like
all of our worst fears -

04:43.825 --> 04:46.578
stuff moving on their own
when they're not supposed to.

04:46.661 --> 04:48.747
It's gonna be a challenge.

04:51.583 --> 04:54.336
Before I tell you guys about
the haunted location

04:54.419 --> 04:56.296
that I'm taking you to
tomorrow night,

04:56.379 --> 04:59.299
I wanted to do something fun,
something from childhood

04:59.382 --> 05:02.594
that me and Chelsea used to do.
I feel like a lot of our experiences

05:02.677 --> 05:05.138
so far on this road trip
have been NOT team bonding.

05:05.221 --> 05:08.892
We've had a lot of separation.
And this'll be a nice team effort

05:08.975 --> 05:12.354
and it'll honestly be needed
to prepare us for tomorrow night.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.689
Chelsea, you're gonna like this
the most.

05:14.773 --> 05:18.693
We're gonna go play some ice hockey.
Nice! That's awesome.

05:18.777 --> 05:21.863
Something people probably don't know
about Chelsea is

05:21.946 --> 05:23.782
she is a badass at hockey.

05:23.865 --> 05:26.576
Hockey was like a big part
of my life, actually.

05:26.659 --> 05:29.204
What was your position?
Goalie.

05:29.287 --> 05:32.457
Chelsea was a goalie.
I've been on skates
since I was four,

05:32.540 --> 05:37.045
but I was lucky enough to play
in high school at the age of 12.

05:37.128 --> 05:40.256
I went on to play
Division One hockey,

05:40.340 --> 05:42.842
had the opportunity to train with
the USA team,

05:42.926 --> 05:45.887
and then took part in
the inaugural season

05:45.970 --> 05:48.431
of the first women's
professional hockey league.

05:50.100 --> 05:53.311
This is gonna be really fun.
We haven't done a lot of things

05:53.395 --> 05:56.439
that bring us together.
This trip has been full of things

05:56.523 --> 05:58.024
that drove us apart.
True.

05:58.108 --> 06:01.444
So I'm glad that we're doing this.
Instead of playing regular hockey,

06:01.528 --> 06:04.072
we're gonna play three on one.
And our whole goal is

06:04.155 --> 06:07.659
to just try to score on Chelsea.
I don't skate. You know that, right?

06:07.742 --> 06:10.787
That's part of the fun.
This is gonna be so embarrassing.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.623
I'm excited.
I don't know how I'm gonna do,

06:13.707 --> 06:16.418
but it sounds like...
I'm gonna get my ass kicked.

06:16.501 --> 06:19.045
(LAUGHTER)

06:21.589 --> 06:23.675
Let's do it!
All right.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.510
OK.

06:25.593 --> 06:28.013
Are you gonna go easy on us?
Please? No.

06:32.767 --> 06:35.020
Come on, boys!
Let's get her!

06:41.568 --> 06:42.777
Come on.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.362
You got this.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.949
Yeah!
Let's go, guys!

06:48.033 --> 06:51.619
Are you ready for this?
You're going down, suckeroon!

06:51.703 --> 06:53.788
All right,
let's see what you guys got.

06:53.872 --> 06:56.124
You think you can stop this?

06:57.792 --> 06:59.252
Dammit!

06:59.336 --> 07:00.420
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

07:02.339 --> 07:03.506
Foul!

07:09.512 --> 07:11.639
No!
This is the net.

07:11.723 --> 07:14.684
(CLUCKING)
You ready for this, Chelsea?

07:14.768 --> 07:17.103
Are you guys gonna play some hockey
or what?

07:20.523 --> 07:23.443
(GROANS) Oh, man.
You guys are so bad

07:23.526 --> 07:25.987
you don't even need me in the net.

07:28.907 --> 07:30.992
Oh, she saved it!

07:32.535 --> 07:34.454
We need to triangulate.
Triangulate?

07:34.537 --> 07:37.374
One of us in the back,
two in the front, pass, pass, pass.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.833
And break! OK.

07:38.917 --> 07:41.503
You better not be doing
what I think you're doing.

07:41.586 --> 07:44.005
Stay in a triangle.

07:44.089 --> 07:47.175
Oh, what's this triangle?
What's this happening?

07:49.219 --> 07:50.720
(LAUGHS)

07:50.804 --> 07:53.306
The jinx is broken!

07:53.390 --> 07:55.475
(WHOOPING AND CHEERING)

07:55.558 --> 07:57.602
Whoo!

07:57.686 --> 07:59.479
That was TWO pucks.

07:59.562 --> 08:01.648
Sucks. Feels terrible.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.692
I really let my team down.

08:03.775 --> 08:06.319
Wait. I don't HAVE a team.

08:06.403 --> 08:09.406
Well, let's go do something
we're ALL good at

08:09.489 --> 08:11.741
and go read the packet. Ladies first.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.119
Stick with filmmaking, brother.

08:14.202 --> 08:16.329
Good game.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.127
OK, where are we?

08:22.210 --> 08:24.546
Just so you guys know,
it might snow tonight.

08:24.629 --> 08:27.966
I know this looks sketchy,
but I did find a barn

08:28.049 --> 08:31.219
for us to pull over right now
and read the packet.

08:37.767 --> 08:40.520
You guys read to find out
why we are here in Iowa?

08:40.603 --> 08:41.813
BOTH: Not really.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.111
BOTH: Edinburgh Manor?!

08:48.194 --> 08:51.239
Hold on. You've been here before.
Wait, with Alex.

08:51.322 --> 08:52.866
Yeah.
Wow.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.617
That was like six years ago.

08:54.701 --> 08:58.079
We couldn't even stay a whole night.
How are we supposed to do this?

08:58.163 --> 09:01.666
I found some new information
and finally we get to go together.

09:01.750 --> 09:04.919
We have definitely been to
a lot more places since then.

09:05.003 --> 09:07.380
I'm curious to see
how we handle it now,

09:07.464 --> 09:09.299
after everything we've been through.

09:12.761 --> 09:15.347
"As one of the only buildings
still standing

09:15.430 --> 09:19.351
amidst the hundreds of acres
of Iowa's flat farmland,

09:19.434 --> 09:22.103
the husk of Edinburgh Manor
waits patiently

09:22.187 --> 09:24.189
for foolhardy visitors to enter

09:24.272 --> 09:26.441
and discover its terrible secrets."

09:26.524 --> 09:29.527
When you drive up to this place,

09:29.611 --> 09:32.072
it's standing there all on its own,

09:32.155 --> 09:34.616
but it draws you to it.

09:34.699 --> 09:37.494
And it looks lonely and sad

09:37.577 --> 09:38.953
and haunted.

09:39.037 --> 09:41.664
"Opened in 1846

09:41.748 --> 09:43.458
as a Jones County poor farm,

09:43.541 --> 09:47.379
the facility provided shelter
to Monticello Iowans impoverished

09:47.462 --> 09:49.255
in exchange for their labour."

09:49.339 --> 09:52.634
The people who lived here
were all ages,

09:52.717 --> 09:54.844
all intelligence levels.

09:54.928 --> 09:58.556
The facilities were usually run
by a steward and matron.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.226
And it was a working farm.

10:01.309 --> 10:04.771
So taking care of the residents
I do not believe

10:04.854 --> 10:07.023
was something that was
high priority.

10:07.107 --> 10:10.902
"The building had no wards
for specific types of care

10:10.985 --> 10:14.739
so the mentally ill were housed
alongside general population.

10:14.823 --> 10:17.951
They received little to no treatment
for their ailments."

10:18.034 --> 10:21.579
A very common way to control someone

10:21.663 --> 10:24.040
was to put them in a straitjacket.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.793
It was very useful at the time.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.336
Humane? Probably not.

10:28.420 --> 10:31.047
But you don't want someone
who is out of control

10:31.131 --> 10:33.174
hurting other people or themselves.

10:35.010 --> 10:38.013
CHELSEA: "The facility was severely
understaffed.

10:38.096 --> 10:40.682
Conditions were so brutal

10:40.765 --> 10:44.978
that one woman jumped out of
a second-storey window

10:45.061 --> 10:47.605
and tried to walk to find help.

10:47.689 --> 10:52.277
Others took their own lives
by ingesting strychnine,

10:52.360 --> 10:56.948
hanging themselves, and even
slitting their own throats."

10:57.032 --> 10:59.534
Those are painful ways to die,

10:59.617 --> 11:02.328
so if they chose that route

11:02.412 --> 11:04.706
instead of just living
at this facility...

11:04.789 --> 11:06.124
It had to be so bad.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.335
In doing research,

11:08.418 --> 11:14.007
I'm up to about 153
documented deaths on the property.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.593
But again, the recordkeeping,
very lacking.

11:16.676 --> 11:20.638
That number's, I would say, it's
at least double if not triple that.

11:20.722 --> 11:22.932
"There is a small graveyard on site

11:23.016 --> 11:25.435
where the last headstone
is inscribed

11:25.518 --> 11:27.937
with the death year 1881."

11:29.022 --> 11:30.774
That predates this building.

11:30.857 --> 11:33.568
We know there is other deaths
after that time,

11:33.651 --> 11:35.612
but we have no idea where they are.

11:37.197 --> 11:41.576
"Edinburgh Manor officially closed
its door for the final time in 2010,

11:41.659 --> 11:45.497
but though the rooms may no longer
be occupied by the living,

11:45.580 --> 11:47.999
there are far too many unexplained
occurrences

11:48.083 --> 11:50.335
to declare it completely soulless."

11:50.418 --> 11:54.089
You can tell when something's
about to happen.

11:54.172 --> 11:56.925
You can feel it. All of a sudden,
the air changes.

11:57.008 --> 11:59.719
And you're just sitting there

11:59.803 --> 12:02.972
feeling like the room's closing in
on you.

12:04.265 --> 12:06.351
I've seen a dark energy.

12:06.434 --> 12:08.812
It scared the hell out of me.

12:08.895 --> 12:11.856
I decided never to come back here
and work again.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.777
"One of the spirits here is Susie,

12:15.860 --> 12:19.114
a child who seems to be
about seven to ten years old.

12:19.197 --> 12:22.575
She loves to sing
and run up and down the halls,

12:22.659 --> 12:26.162
moving toys
and lighting up devices."

12:26.246 --> 12:30.417
I've seen toys light up and make
noise when no-one is around them.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.919
She tends to be more friendly,

12:33.003 --> 12:35.964
but still a little sneaky.
(CHUCKLES)

12:36.047 --> 12:38.133
She likes to pull on clothes.

12:39.217 --> 12:41.511
"The blue and red rooms,

12:41.594 --> 12:44.931
found on opposite ends
of the second floor,

12:45.015 --> 12:47.684
these rooms are tied together.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.395
When one is incredibly hot,

12:50.478 --> 12:54.566
the other is absolutely frigid,
and vice versa."

12:56.151 --> 13:01.281
They are directly across each other
down this long hallway.

13:01.364 --> 13:04.159
If you sit in one of those rooms

13:04.242 --> 13:07.454
and you're just kind of quiet,

13:07.537 --> 13:11.458
out of nowhere you'll start hearing
full-on conversations

13:11.541 --> 13:13.501
between a man and a woman.

13:13.585 --> 13:17.881
I do know there's a very large man
in that room.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.800
He's very imposing. Very tall.

13:20.884 --> 13:22.719
He dislikes men.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.764
"In both of these rooms,

13:25.847 --> 13:29.392
people experience a ton of intense
physical interactions -

13:29.476 --> 13:34.230
sharp pains,
and splitting headaches."

13:34.314 --> 13:37.984
Terrifying. They're on like
opposite sides of the building

13:38.068 --> 13:40.862
but then, yeah,
when one experiences something,

13:40.945 --> 13:43.573
the other experiences the opposite.
Weird.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.993
Yeah. I don't know how to explain
that. I've never heard of that.

13:47.077 --> 13:48.995
"The basement.

13:49.079 --> 13:53.667
The most menacing area
in the entire manor.

13:53.750 --> 13:56.753
The basement is home to an entity

13:56.836 --> 13:59.756
known solely as Joker."

14:00.715 --> 14:02.967
He's very, very tall.
No facial features.

14:03.051 --> 14:07.180
He tends to also be mischievous.
But his main purpose is
to make you afraid of him.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.515
(CUP SMASHES)

14:08.598 --> 14:11.351
"He is an incredibly angry
poltergeist

14:11.434 --> 14:14.562
that constantly throws items around,

14:14.646 --> 14:18.483
smashing them against the wall."

14:18.566 --> 14:24.280
He might not be one of these
individuals that lived here.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.616
I think it could be something else -

14:26.700 --> 14:28.993
that he's here
cos he wants to be here.

14:29.077 --> 14:31.955
Maybe he likes scaring the hell
out of people.

14:33.164 --> 14:36.626
If I would have known that
when me and you were there
six years ago, Alex,

14:36.710 --> 14:38.628
I never would have gone
in the basement.

14:38.712 --> 14:41.423
I wouldn't have stepped foot
in the building!

14:41.506 --> 14:43.967
If you really want a challenge,

14:44.050 --> 14:46.886
I would put a female
down in the basement.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.722
But just keep an eye on her.

14:49.973 --> 14:51.641
"When he is nearby,

14:51.725 --> 14:55.895
he fills people with sudden bursts
of anger and fear

14:55.979 --> 14:59.983
and lashes out verbally
at those they are with."

15:00.066 --> 15:02.819
When I was in the basement,

15:02.902 --> 15:07.490
out of nowhere I just started
yelling and screaming

15:07.574 --> 15:10.035
and it was like a complete
personality change.

15:10.118 --> 15:14.372
Something that was absolutely not
who I am.

15:14.456 --> 15:18.293
And I just didn't have control
over it.

15:18.376 --> 15:20.128
It was just not me.

15:23.381 --> 15:26.551
When I did the research and I found
this out, there was no question

15:26.634 --> 15:29.429
that we have to go back.
Because we had no bias last time.

15:29.512 --> 15:32.599
We didn't hear this information.
That freaks me out so bad

15:32.682 --> 15:35.268
hearing that.
Yeah. If Joke's real

15:35.352 --> 15:37.479
and he is down there,
he got his way last time.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.356
We were gone within minutes.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.442
You have some unfinished business.
Definitely.

15:55.955 --> 15:59.626
On the road to our next location!

15:59.709 --> 16:01.378
Edinburgh Manor!

16:01.461 --> 16:04.631
Here we go. Alex, how you feeling?
We're going back.

16:04.714 --> 16:07.467
You know, I never thought
we would have to ever go back

16:07.550 --> 16:09.135
into this building.

16:09.219 --> 16:11.262
I am not excited to be going
to the basement

16:11.346 --> 16:14.140
and I know that's where you'll want
to spend a lot of time.

16:14.224 --> 16:15.725
Yeah, you're right.

16:15.809 --> 16:19.521
All I remember is the feeling
when you set foot down there.

16:19.604 --> 16:23.942
It's a raw feeling. But now knowing
that our feeling down there

16:24.025 --> 16:26.695
is validated by a story
that numerous people

16:26.778 --> 16:28.113
have had happen to them,

16:28.196 --> 16:30.448
I'm not looking forward to this
at all.

16:30.532 --> 16:33.451
That really tells you a lot about
your gut feeling

16:33.535 --> 16:36.413
and how there's a lot of accuracy
to that.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.665
I want to get to the bottom
of the basement.

16:38.748 --> 16:41.126
Just to actually go down there
for multiple hours

16:41.209 --> 16:42.627
is gonna be my main goal.

16:46.881 --> 16:50.969
Oh, my gosh! I don't wanna do this.

16:51.052 --> 16:53.346
Chelsea, Tanner,
you guys wanna go up front?

16:53.430 --> 16:55.515
Because we are getting very close.

16:55.598 --> 16:59.269
I feel like I'd be more nervous if
I was Alex and Dakota right now

16:59.352 --> 17:02.814
because they've been here but they
couldn't complete the night.

17:02.897 --> 17:05.316
Who knows? Maybe this place
remembers them

17:05.400 --> 17:07.652
and they'll pick on THEM
most of the night.

17:08.653 --> 17:11.573
Spooky time starts now.

17:13.241 --> 17:15.201
Is that it right there?
Yeah, that's it.

17:15.285 --> 17:17.078
I could throw up right now.

17:17.162 --> 17:19.581
My stomach is in knots.
No way, man!

17:19.664 --> 17:21.499
That's so eerie.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.668
Welcome to Edinburgh, guys.

17:25.253 --> 17:28.006
(LAUGHS) Holy shit.
Dude!

17:28.089 --> 17:30.383
Oh, my God, I don't want to be back.

17:30.467 --> 17:33.595
This is bringing back
terrible memories.

17:35.013 --> 17:38.683
Dude, I do not like this.
Going in. Let's do it.

17:38.767 --> 17:40.226
All right, let's go.

17:42.854 --> 17:46.232
Here goes something.
We're back, baby. We're back.

17:47.817 --> 17:49.652
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

17:49.736 --> 17:51.446
My gosh.

17:51.529 --> 17:53.782
I have a terrible feeling
in my gut right now.

17:53.865 --> 17:55.909
Same feeling that I had last time.

17:59.621 --> 18:01.706
So we just set up our gear room

18:01.790 --> 18:02.957
on the first floor

18:03.041 --> 18:05.335
and now we are about to start
our overnight.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.504
Let's just start on the second floor

18:07.587 --> 18:11.049
and slowly work our way down
to the dreaded basement.

18:17.347 --> 18:18.973
OK.

18:19.057 --> 18:20.809
Oh, my gosh.

18:20.892 --> 18:22.477
Damn!

18:22.560 --> 18:24.145
Feels weird to be back.

18:26.731 --> 18:28.608
Is there anybody here?

18:28.692 --> 18:30.777
If you can hear my voice,

18:30.860 --> 18:32.737
can you make a sound?

18:32.821 --> 18:35.073
Make a noise so that we know
where to go?

18:40.662 --> 18:43.289
What do you guys say
we go to room 200?

18:43.373 --> 18:46.793
I know that that's where people
have gotten very interesting EVPs.

18:46.876 --> 18:48.628
Sure.
Let's do it.

18:48.712 --> 18:52.048
So we've now sat down
right outside of room 200.

18:52.132 --> 18:53.591
It's right in front of me.

18:53.675 --> 18:55.844
I know when others have looked into
room 200,

18:55.927 --> 18:58.346
they've seen what they describe as
a little boy

18:58.430 --> 19:01.516
holding his injured arm.
I am going to roll

19:01.599 --> 19:02.892
on the digital recorder.

19:02.976 --> 19:05.186
This is a device that picks up
frequencies

19:05.270 --> 19:06.563
that our ears cannot hear.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.982
It's believed it can pick up
spirit voices.

19:09.065 --> 19:11.609
So I'm gonna roll on this,
set it on the bed

19:11.693 --> 19:13.194
inside of room 200,

19:13.278 --> 19:16.698
and just ask a bunch of questions
and hopefully we get something.

19:16.781 --> 19:19.284
If there's somebody that can hear
my voice right now,

19:19.367 --> 19:22.871
I have something in this room 200
that if you talk

19:22.954 --> 19:25.707
we will be able to hear you.
Can you tell us who you are?

19:25.790 --> 19:27.208
Can you tell us your name?

19:28.626 --> 19:30.628
Were you a resident here?

19:30.712 --> 19:32.005
A worker?

19:32.088 --> 19:33.798
Or were you something else?

19:35.800 --> 19:39.179
We know that you've been grabbing
people inside of room 200.

19:39.262 --> 19:42.390
How come you're doing that?
How come you're so angry?

19:44.351 --> 19:46.561
Who is the little boy in room 200

19:46.644 --> 19:48.313
who's holding onto his arm?

19:48.396 --> 19:50.482
And what happened to his arm?

19:52.817 --> 19:56.404
All right, so I just grabbed
the digital recorder out of room 200.

19:56.488 --> 19:59.282
I'm gonna play this back
and see if we got anything.

19:59.366 --> 20:03.203
RECORDING: 'Can you tell us who you
are? Can you tell us your name?'

20:06.331 --> 20:08.166
'Were you a resident here?

20:08.249 --> 20:09.542
A worker?

20:09.626 --> 20:11.711
Or were you something else?'

20:13.380 --> 20:17.008
'We know that you've been grabbing
people inside of room 200.

20:17.092 --> 20:19.969
How come you're doing that?
Why are you so angry?'

20:21.513 --> 20:23.890
'Who is the little boy in room 200

20:23.973 --> 20:26.059
who's holding onto his arm?

20:26.142 --> 20:27.769
And what happened to his arm?'

20:34.984 --> 20:38.905
Nothing. We got nothing
on the digital recorder.

20:38.988 --> 20:41.700
We asked a bunch of
different questions.

20:41.783 --> 20:43.785
I mean, we're trying.
Yeah, this a room

20:43.868 --> 20:47.205
where people have gotten EVPs
before, so it was worth a shot.

20:58.758 --> 21:02.012
Really? Slippers right at the edge
of the bed?

21:02.095 --> 21:03.638
No thanks.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.939
So this is the men's side right now?

21:13.023 --> 21:15.650
Yeah, we're on the men's side
on the second floor.

21:15.734 --> 21:19.612
So like if families came here,
you were separated from your spouse?

21:19.696 --> 21:23.033
I think so, yeah. At least separated
by part of the building.

21:23.116 --> 21:25.660
Couldn't imagine.
This place would really suck.

21:25.744 --> 21:27.287
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

21:32.751 --> 21:34.836
So, I do have an idea.

21:34.919 --> 21:37.547
What could it possibly be?

21:37.630 --> 21:40.508
Chelsea and Tanner, I want you guys
to go to the blue room

21:40.592 --> 21:41.885
on the women's side,

21:41.968 --> 21:44.554
while me and Alex go to the red room
on the men's side.

21:44.637 --> 21:47.640
A lot of people say there's
a connection between these rooms,

21:47.724 --> 21:50.685
that when activity happens in one,
it happens in the other.

21:50.769 --> 21:53.646
Most of the reports within
these two rooms are physical,

21:53.730 --> 21:56.524
so no gear. I want everyone
just to be very vocal

21:56.608 --> 22:00.028
about how they're feeling, and if
they're feeling anything at all.

22:00.111 --> 22:02.697
I do not want to split up.

22:02.781 --> 22:06.117
I do not want to experience
anything physical.

22:06.201 --> 22:08.912
But I am incredibly curious

22:08.995 --> 22:11.831
about the connection between
these two rooms.

22:11.915 --> 22:14.709
All right, let's do it.
See you guys. See ya.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.089
All right, this is the red room.

22:19.172 --> 22:20.298
Dude.

22:20.382 --> 22:23.510
Before we get started,
I am gonna set up a wide camera.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.935
Chelsea and I, we just stepped foot

22:32.018 --> 22:33.395
into the blue room.

22:33.478 --> 22:34.813
Ooh, this is creepy.

22:34.896 --> 22:37.774
I'm really curious on
what's gonna happen here

22:37.857 --> 22:40.610
because if these two rooms
are connected

22:40.694 --> 22:43.029
I don't know what's gonna happen.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.950
Is there anyone in here with us?

22:47.033 --> 22:50.078
If there's someone in here,
can you move something,

22:50.161 --> 22:52.997
move an object or get closer to us
so we feel you?

23:00.505 --> 23:03.008
Holy shit, it is freezing in here.

23:03.091 --> 23:05.719
This room is definitely colder

23:05.802 --> 23:08.596
than any other part
of the entire building.

23:15.770 --> 23:17.856
Did you just hear footsteps?
Yes.

23:17.939 --> 23:19.816
Outside the doors.

23:19.899 --> 23:24.988
It sounds like something is like
just like pacing in the hallway.

23:27.741 --> 23:31.703
Dude, I am like really, really warm
in here.

23:31.786 --> 23:34.622
It's definitely like
noticeably hotter in this room.

23:34.706 --> 23:37.709
I am like almost need to take
my jacket off in here.

23:37.792 --> 23:42.297
I wonder if this room is like...
No, nothing's on. There's no power.

23:42.380 --> 23:45.258
Hey, Chelsea and Tanner?
Yeah.

23:45.342 --> 23:47.677
What's the temperature feel like
for you guys?

23:47.761 --> 23:50.555
Dude, we're freezing in here.
OK, that's weird

23:50.638 --> 23:54.517
cos me and Alex are like
noticeably warmer. What?!

23:56.311 --> 23:58.021
This doesn't make any sense.

23:58.104 --> 24:00.106
Like there's gotta be a reason
for it.

24:00.190 --> 24:02.984
Like why is there this
polar opposite connection

24:03.068 --> 24:04.486
between these two rooms?

24:04.569 --> 24:06.821
What could have happened
in these two rooms

24:06.905 --> 24:08.615
that now they're connected?

24:08.698 --> 24:11.618
I wonder if there is like something
actually explainable.

24:11.701 --> 24:13.787
Why would this side of the building,

24:13.870 --> 24:17.040
same room, just opposite side be hot
and that one be cold?

24:17.123 --> 24:19.209
The only thing that I can think of

24:19.292 --> 24:22.587
is maybe this side sees
more sunlight during the day,

24:22.671 --> 24:25.757
so it retains that heat.
But I don't know.

24:25.840 --> 24:28.927
I haven't been here during the day.
If you can hear my voice,

24:29.010 --> 24:32.347
can you go into one of these rooms,
the red room or the blue room?

24:32.430 --> 24:35.350
There's someone up
on the second floor.

24:35.433 --> 24:38.770
Can you please make a noise,
let us know that you're here?

24:42.524 --> 24:44.609
(CREAKING)

24:44.693 --> 24:47.070
What the fuck? This bed just creaked.

24:47.153 --> 24:50.240
You're not even touching it.
No, I'm not touching it.

24:50.323 --> 24:53.702
Like it straight up creaked. Almost
like something put pressure on it,

24:53.785 --> 24:55.495
like was sitting on this bed.

24:57.372 --> 24:59.207
(CREAKING)

24:59.290 --> 25:00.959
Tanner!
What?

25:01.042 --> 25:03.128
Right after you asked that,

25:03.211 --> 25:05.839
for whatever's on the second floor
to make a noise,

25:05.922 --> 25:09.634
the bed next to me creaked.
Almost like someone sat on it.

25:09.718 --> 25:11.803
Are you serious?
Yeah, dude.

25:16.433 --> 25:19.185
My stomach is starting to hurt.
Really?

25:19.269 --> 25:21.646
Mm-hm. Feels like it's like almost
in my chest.

25:21.730 --> 25:24.858
Have you felt that at all
all night? No. Just happened.

25:24.941 --> 25:27.068
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

25:27.152 --> 25:28.820
Yo, you guys?
What?

25:28.903 --> 25:31.573
Are you guys feeling OK?
Cos something's going on.

25:31.656 --> 25:34.284
Alex is like feeling something
in his lungs.

25:34.367 --> 25:36.745
Are you OK?
Dude, what the fuck was that?

25:36.828 --> 25:38.580
Are you OK?
Yeah.

25:38.663 --> 25:40.749
Lungs?
Does he need help?

25:40.832 --> 25:42.834
I'm good. I'm good now.
He says he's OK,

25:42.917 --> 25:45.587
but that was weird.
That hit you out of nowhere.

25:45.670 --> 25:49.132
It felt like someone just came up
and was just squeezing me.

25:56.056 --> 25:58.224
Hey, are you guys walking
towards us?

25:58.308 --> 26:00.393
No, we are sitting in the room.

26:02.270 --> 26:04.105
OK, something was walk...

26:04.189 --> 26:07.025
I thought you guys were walking
towards us right now. No.

26:07.108 --> 26:08.777
We haven't moved.

26:08.860 --> 26:11.363
I thought they were done
and they were coming over.

26:11.446 --> 26:13.365
I have chills
throughout my whole body.

26:13.448 --> 26:16.159
I have said this already,
but we are not alone here.

26:16.242 --> 26:19.120
Oh, that was creepy. What the fuck?

26:21.581 --> 26:24.459
I think it's safe to say that
the red room and the blue room

26:24.542 --> 26:26.419
will be sleeping arrangements.

26:26.503 --> 26:29.047
We should have those people
definitely bring gear

26:29.130 --> 26:31.341
to try and even take it
a step farther.

26:32.300 --> 26:34.678
Hey, guys?
Yeah?

26:34.761 --> 26:37.472
What do you say we wrap it up?
Deal.

26:39.057 --> 26:42.394
Oh, my gosh.
How weird was that?!

26:42.477 --> 26:46.147
If it was like just one or two
things that happened to us,

26:46.231 --> 26:49.150
I would go like, "Oh, maybe we're
psyching ourselves out."

26:49.234 --> 26:52.112
But the fact that it was constantly
going back and forth,

26:52.195 --> 26:54.197
back and forth, and messing with us

26:54.280 --> 26:56.324
the entire time we were in there,

26:56.408 --> 26:59.494
like there's got to be something
else that explains that.

26:59.577 --> 27:01.246
(SIGHS)
Are you OK, man?

27:01.329 --> 27:04.624
I'm good. I'm ready to get off
this floor though. (SNIFFS)

27:08.837 --> 27:11.756
All right, do you guys want
to go down to the basement

27:11.840 --> 27:14.759
and face The Joker?
I'm just glad we're in a group.

27:18.763 --> 27:21.725
Oh, gosh, I don't like this.

27:26.438 --> 27:30.692
The basement is said to be haunted
by a spirit they call Joker.

27:30.775 --> 27:34.279
Joker is known for
his poltergeist activity

27:34.362 --> 27:37.073
where he throws things at the walls,

27:37.157 --> 27:40.410
he moves things,
and the whole goal of The Joker

27:40.493 --> 27:41.995
is to get people out.

27:42.078 --> 27:44.330
When me and Alex were here
six years ago,

27:44.414 --> 27:46.708
we hardly made it past
where I'm standing.

27:46.791 --> 27:48.460
This is as far as we made it.

28:06.186 --> 28:08.271
(PLAYS NOTES)

28:09.856 --> 28:11.775
(PLAYS NOTES)

28:29.250 --> 28:31.336
Joker, are you down here?

28:41.638 --> 28:44.974
I don't like it. I just have
a terrible gut feeling.

28:45.058 --> 28:48.895
Like it honestly feels like you're
playing with a jack-in-the-box.

28:48.978 --> 28:53.191
And the song is playing and you're
just waiting for it to pop open.

28:53.274 --> 28:55.819
And the inevitable
is about to happen.

28:57.404 --> 29:00.490
Oh, yeah, this is just terrifying.

29:10.917 --> 29:15.338
OK, so right now we are basically
in the dead centre of the basement.

29:15.422 --> 29:17.215
I've set up two cameras down here -

29:17.298 --> 29:20.927
one all the way down this hall
in a boiler room area,

29:21.011 --> 29:24.222
and I have a REM Pod
sitting on a table in that room.

29:24.305 --> 29:27.892
And I've set up a second camera
around this corner to our left

29:27.976 --> 29:30.478
feeding into the padded-cell room.

29:30.562 --> 29:33.231
There's also a REM Pod on the ground
for that as well.

29:33.314 --> 29:35.734
If anything gets close
to the REM Pod, it'll beep.

29:35.817 --> 29:38.403
And the closer it gets
the more the beeping increases.

29:38.486 --> 29:41.781
My goal with this is
I want to sit here in the centre

29:41.865 --> 29:43.408
and not miss a sound.

29:43.491 --> 29:46.036
And I'm hoping if we hear something,
or anything,

29:46.119 --> 29:50.248
that we'll at least be able to
capture it on those cameras
if it's not in this room.

29:50.331 --> 29:52.625
Joker, if you're down here

29:52.709 --> 29:55.712
can you go up to one of those
red lights that are on the ground?

29:55.795 --> 29:57.922
One over there,
and one in the padded room.

29:58.006 --> 29:59.549
Can you touch them?

30:04.095 --> 30:07.766
We know you like to push things
and throw things and move objects.

30:07.849 --> 30:10.226
Can you prove that to us?
Can you do that?

30:13.980 --> 30:17.734
We heard you like playing games
and tricks on people.

30:17.817 --> 30:20.028
Can you make one of the REM Pods
go off?

30:22.155 --> 30:24.240
(BEEPING)

30:24.324 --> 30:27.577
I think the REM Pod just went off
down there!

30:27.660 --> 30:31.373
Right down in the boiler room,
I just heard beeping.

30:31.456 --> 30:33.541
Can you do that again?

30:35.043 --> 30:37.170
How come you're so far away?

30:37.253 --> 30:40.924
Can't you get closer to us? Can't you
do something in front of us?

30:43.301 --> 30:45.387
We heard you like to move things.

30:45.470 --> 30:47.555
Can you move something now?

30:54.145 --> 30:57.148
It's pretty quiet.
It's like too quiet.

30:57.232 --> 31:01.069
I have one idea. I'm gonna put out
the digital recorder.

31:01.152 --> 31:04.781
Let's just continue to ask questions,
but this time in hopes of getting

31:04.864 --> 31:06.950
an actual audio response.

31:07.033 --> 31:10.286
This recorder picks up frequencies
that our ears cannot hear

31:10.370 --> 31:12.580
and it's said it can pick up
spirit voices.

31:12.664 --> 31:15.250
I'm gonna set this on the table.

31:15.333 --> 31:19.004
Joker, I have a device
that can hear your voice.

31:19.087 --> 31:22.966
If you talk right now, Joker,
we will be able to hear you.

31:23.049 --> 31:25.135
What do you want to say to us?

31:27.387 --> 31:29.931
(UNEXPLAINED LAUGH)
What is that?

31:30.015 --> 31:32.642
It sounded like laughing.

31:32.726 --> 31:34.811
Like laughing.

31:34.894 --> 31:36.771
What the fuck was that?

31:36.855 --> 31:40.275
I'm not even kidding. It sounds like
our Joker would laugh.

31:44.571 --> 31:45.989
What is that?

31:50.201 --> 31:52.287
Joker, what are you?

31:53.913 --> 31:56.541
Were you a resident here
who was wronged?

31:56.624 --> 32:00.253
Or are you something else,
something completely different?

32:00.337 --> 32:03.048
Why do you want people
out of the basement?

32:08.053 --> 32:10.638
This is your last chance
to say something,

32:10.722 --> 32:14.768
to give us a message before we will
no longer be able to hear your voice.

32:17.479 --> 32:20.190
All right, I am going to cut
on the digital recorder.

32:20.273 --> 32:23.610
RECORDING: 'OK, I'm gonna put out
the digital recorder.

32:23.693 --> 32:25.612
I'm gonna set this on the table.

32:25.695 --> 32:29.616
If you talk right now, Joker,
we will be able to hear you.

32:29.699 --> 32:31.785
What do you want to say to us?'

32:37.874 --> 32:39.959
'Joker, what are you?'

32:41.461 --> 32:44.506
(UNEXPLAINED SCREAM)
CHELSEA: What the fuck?

32:44.589 --> 32:47.217
What was that?!
Almost like a scream

32:47.300 --> 32:48.468
mixed with like a laugh.

32:48.551 --> 32:50.845
(IMITATES SOUND)
I've never heard anything

32:50.929 --> 32:54.307
that loud before.
I have goosebumps everywhere.

32:55.392 --> 32:57.477
'Joker, what are you?'

32:59.729 --> 33:02.315
Freakin' creepiest thing
I've ever heard.

33:02.399 --> 33:05.527
Let's just keep playing,
see if we got anything else.

33:05.610 --> 33:09.030
'Were you a resident here
who was wronged?

33:09.114 --> 33:12.784
Or are you something else,
something completely different?'

33:14.828 --> 33:17.455
'Why do you want people
out of the basement?'

33:21.459 --> 33:24.129
'This is your last chance
to say something,

33:24.212 --> 33:28.258
to give us a message before we will
no longer be able to hear you voice.'

33:28.341 --> 33:30.260
(UNEXPLAINED SCREAM)
Dude!

33:30.343 --> 33:32.804
What is happening?
What is going on?

33:32.887 --> 33:34.973
That was like more high-pitched
this time.

33:35.056 --> 33:38.476
It doesn't even sound human.
No, that does not sound human.

33:38.560 --> 33:40.395
Let me play that one again.

33:40.478 --> 33:42.564
'..to give us a message

33:42.647 --> 33:45.191
before we will no longer be able
to hear your voice.'

33:46.985 --> 33:48.987
No. No.
What is that?!

33:49.070 --> 33:52.907
Actually, no. Like fuck that.
That's so scary.

33:52.991 --> 33:56.578
It's almost as if it was like
crouching on top of the table

33:56.661 --> 33:59.497
with its mouth just right over
the digital recorder.

33:59.581 --> 34:03.251
It sounds like it's that close.
Like it's within a foot
of the recorder.

34:03.335 --> 34:06.171
The digital recorder
doesn't get louder than that.

34:06.254 --> 34:08.631
That was the last question too.
I said, "Joker,

34:08.715 --> 34:13.887
this is the last time you're gonna be
able to say something" and that was
what he did. He laughed again.

34:13.970 --> 34:17.265
Chelsea, do you remember when I was
in the middle of asking questions

34:17.349 --> 34:19.851
and you heard like a faint laughter?
Yes.

34:19.934 --> 34:22.479
The cameras might have hardly even
picked it up,

34:22.562 --> 34:25.899
but this is almost like a more
close-up version of that. Yes!

34:25.982 --> 34:27.984
It is. It's like amplified.

34:28.068 --> 34:31.279
Maybe he's laughing because he knows
this isn't the last thing

34:31.363 --> 34:32.530
he's gonna do.

34:34.115 --> 34:36.201
OK, I say we get outta here.
Yeah.

34:36.284 --> 34:40.163
Honestly, like, he didn't want to
talk. He didn't want to give us words

34:40.246 --> 34:42.165
or answers,
he just wanted to scare us.

34:42.248 --> 34:46.127
The thing that sucks is
now we have to go to bed.

34:46.211 --> 34:49.130
The next part of the night
is separating and sleeping alone.

34:50.507 --> 34:52.217
Unfortunately, right now

34:52.300 --> 34:54.427
it is time for us to go to bed.

34:54.511 --> 34:57.931
Separated and alone
at Edinburgh Manor.

34:58.014 --> 34:59.766
We believe that when you are alone

34:59.849 --> 35:01.059
and when you are scared,

35:01.142 --> 35:04.229
that it only brings out more
paranormal activity.

35:04.312 --> 35:07.899
We've all agreed on the four scariest
locations for us to go sleep.

35:07.982 --> 35:11.611
Our first two sleeping arrangements,
we have the blue room

35:11.695 --> 35:13.196
in the second floor,

35:13.279 --> 35:15.240
and the red room on the second floor.

35:15.323 --> 35:17.200
For our next sleeping arrangement,

35:17.283 --> 35:19.160
we have the first floor hallway.

35:19.244 --> 35:20.704
When we were on the first floor,

35:20.787 --> 35:23.331
we didn't experience anything
paranormal yet.

35:23.415 --> 35:25.750
For our fourth and final
sleeping arrangement,

35:25.834 --> 35:27.502
we have the basement.

35:27.585 --> 35:29.838
So those are our floor
sleeping arrangements.

35:29.921 --> 35:32.507
Tanners gonna write those out
on a piece of paper

35:32.590 --> 35:36.136
and we're gonna draw,
and that's where you sleep
for the rest of the night.

35:36.219 --> 35:38.888
How about Alex? You draw first.
Why?

35:38.972 --> 35:40.557
Just draw first. I don't know.

35:43.977 --> 35:45.979
This one.

35:47.397 --> 35:50.025
(SIGHS WITH RELIEF)
First floor hallway.

35:50.108 --> 35:52.819
First floor hallway.
Ho-ho!

35:52.902 --> 35:55.905
We haven't been down here really
at all tonight

35:55.989 --> 35:59.659
so I'm kinda going into this
sleeping alone blind.

35:59.743 --> 36:02.954
But I am still so thankful
that I'm not in the basement.

36:03.038 --> 36:04.497
Sweet.

36:04.581 --> 36:06.666
Tanner's up.

36:09.336 --> 36:10.837
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

36:15.175 --> 36:18.470
The red room.
OK, it's not the basement.

36:18.553 --> 36:20.847
However, this is the room
that you guys were in,

36:20.930 --> 36:23.850
so I have never been in this room.
Out of all the options,

36:23.933 --> 36:26.728
I'll take this one any day. Phew!

36:26.811 --> 36:28.355
You're up, Chels.

36:28.438 --> 36:30.690
I literally can't do the basement.

36:30.774 --> 36:32.484
Like it can't happen.

36:33.902 --> 36:37.238
See if you're the same.
I'm actually so nervous for you.

36:37.322 --> 36:40.241
I'm gonna throw up.
I'm seriously gonna throw up.

36:42.160 --> 36:44.788
Noooooo!
(LAUGHS)

36:44.871 --> 36:46.956
Got you! I got the blue room!

36:47.040 --> 36:49.834
(SQUEALING AND LAUGHING)

36:52.587 --> 36:55.465
Let's go!

36:55.548 --> 36:57.634
(LAUGHS)

36:59.094 --> 37:01.179
Let's go! (LAUGHS)

37:02.597 --> 37:04.474
Yeah!
This is great!

37:04.557 --> 37:06.226
For everyone!

37:06.309 --> 37:10.563
Oh, that was the greatest psych-out.
Yeah, I thought you picked
the basement.

37:10.647 --> 37:13.108
I was gonna be so sorry for you.
This room is scary.

37:13.191 --> 37:15.402
It is not as scary as the basement.

37:15.485 --> 37:17.570
But we'll see. I'm out of breath.

37:17.654 --> 37:19.864
This absolutely sucks.

37:19.948 --> 37:24.327
I will be accompanied by
a fucking Joker tonight.

37:24.411 --> 37:25.995
This is sick.

37:26.079 --> 37:29.416
I'm not confident. I'm actually
frickin' terrified to be down there,

37:29.499 --> 37:31.668
especially after what we just
encountered.

37:31.751 --> 37:33.712
Can you guys all walk me down there?

37:35.005 --> 37:38.008
I gotta get to MY room.
Yeah, we gotta go to bed.

37:38.091 --> 37:41.302
Can SOMEONE just give me
frickin' some sort of advice?

37:41.386 --> 37:44.139
Run fast. Don't shit your pants.
Thanks.

37:50.311 --> 37:52.981
(GROANS) Oh, my goodness gracious.

37:53.064 --> 37:54.774
I got this.

38:01.740 --> 38:03.783
All right, I have the Ovilus
in my hands.

38:03.867 --> 38:06.870
This is a device that has a word
database inside it.

38:06.953 --> 38:09.748
It's said spirits are able to
manipulate the frequencies

38:09.831 --> 38:12.292
inside of this device
and select words.

38:12.375 --> 38:14.461
Who's here with me?

38:15.754 --> 38:19.007
Were you one of the men?
I'm on the men's side of the ward.

38:20.508 --> 38:22.886
Why are these two rooms connected?

38:22.969 --> 38:25.055
What is causing that?

38:29.642 --> 38:32.270
I've had this thing on for forever.

38:32.354 --> 38:35.398
I just haven't gotten anything.

38:38.360 --> 38:39.944
OK, so right here

38:40.028 --> 38:42.113
I have the music box.

38:42.197 --> 38:45.116
This is a motion sensor device.

38:45.200 --> 38:49.079
I'm gonna set this down facing
towards the other camera down there.

38:49.162 --> 38:50.747
So if I were to do this...
(BEEP)

38:50.830 --> 38:54.834
..it goes off. None of my movement
can trigger this right now.

38:54.918 --> 38:57.962
And light doesn't do it either.
Flashlights won't do it.

38:58.046 --> 38:59.297
It's not triggering it.

38:59.381 --> 39:01.466
If there's anyone down here,

39:01.549 --> 39:04.636
can you please make this music box
go off?

39:04.719 --> 39:07.305
Susie, if you're down here with me,

39:07.389 --> 39:09.182
can you come play with this toy?

39:09.265 --> 39:11.810
All you have to do is walk into
this hallway

39:11.893 --> 39:13.978
and step in front of it.

39:18.525 --> 39:21.569
This is not the worst sleeping
arrangement I've had

39:21.653 --> 39:23.279
on this trip so far.

39:23.363 --> 39:25.448
I'm feeling pretty lucky.

39:25.532 --> 39:29.619
I definitely do not envy my brother
right now in the basement.

39:33.164 --> 39:35.333
I brought down the digital recorder.

39:35.417 --> 39:36.876
I'm gonna do a follow-up.

39:36.960 --> 39:40.171
I'm gonna see if he wants to
actually speak this time

39:40.255 --> 39:41.464
and not just scream.

39:42.674 --> 39:45.301
Joker, you can now speak to me

39:45.385 --> 39:46.970
and I will be able to hear you.

39:47.053 --> 39:50.640
What do you want me to know? What
type of message do you have for me?

39:53.560 --> 39:57.230
Why do you like to throw things
and scare people out of here?

39:58.440 --> 40:01.609
Does it bother you
that I'm down here in your space?

40:04.446 --> 40:06.990
I'm gonna cut
on the digital recorder.

40:08.658 --> 40:11.244
I just played back
the entire recording.

40:11.327 --> 40:14.289
There was nothing at all
that sounded out of the ordinary

40:14.372 --> 40:16.416
other than just white noise.

40:16.499 --> 40:19.210
I do find it weird that
he doesn't want to talk.

40:19.294 --> 40:21.087
(PIANO NOTE)
What the fuck?

40:22.213 --> 40:24.215
(PIANO NOTE)
Oh, my God!

40:24.299 --> 40:26.301
That's the fucking piano!

40:26.384 --> 40:27.802
Hello?

40:29.220 --> 40:31.473
I'm honestly like frozen right now.

40:31.556 --> 40:34.809
I don't want to move, but I'm gonna
go check the piano area.

40:46.905 --> 40:48.823
I just heard a piano

40:48.907 --> 40:50.992
and I know the piano works

40:51.076 --> 40:54.287
because earlier tonight
Tanner was playing it.

40:54.371 --> 40:57.207
OK. This is the room.

40:57.290 --> 41:00.377
That's the piano.
I heard like a high key.

41:00.460 --> 41:02.504
(PLAYS NOTE)
Like that.

41:02.587 --> 41:05.048
Like I am almost
100 per cent positive

41:05.131 --> 41:08.343
that that's what I heard as I heard
the frickin' piano.

41:10.470 --> 41:12.055
Hello?

41:13.598 --> 41:17.018
Now that I'm in here, can you play
the piano again in front of me?

41:24.192 --> 41:26.277
OK, I'm gonna get outta here.

41:27.737 --> 41:31.449
I don't know what the hell
is happening. I know that's
what I heard.

41:31.533 --> 41:35.078
I'm wondering if like The Joker,
or whatever it is down here,

41:35.161 --> 41:37.414
heard us playing the piano earlier

41:37.497 --> 41:39.416
and now it's just mocking us.

41:39.499 --> 41:41.960
It's like he's being tricky,
he's moving things

41:42.043 --> 41:46.089
and doing poltergeist type activity
but not where my camera is.

41:46.172 --> 41:49.092
I can tell you right now,
I'm like this close

41:49.175 --> 41:51.261
to just being done.

41:55.557 --> 41:58.727
Susie, I heard you like
to have people play with you.

41:58.810 --> 42:01.855
I'm here all night.
If you want to get my attention,

42:01.938 --> 42:05.150
walk in front of this music box
and I'll know you're here.

42:08.236 --> 42:10.196
Nothing.
(SHUFFLING)

42:10.280 --> 42:12.574
What the fuck?

42:12.657 --> 42:14.617
Hello?

42:22.792 --> 42:24.878
Dude, I swear, it just sounded like

42:24.961 --> 42:27.672
someone walking down that hallway
towards me.

42:27.756 --> 42:29.341
What...the...hell?

42:32.093 --> 42:33.970
(POUNDING ON DOOR)
Oh, fuck!

42:34.054 --> 42:35.805
What the shit?

42:35.889 --> 42:38.558
Dude, it is surrounding me
right now!

42:38.641 --> 42:40.727
Dude, is Alex OK?

42:40.810 --> 42:43.355
I don't know.
I'm trying to walkie him.

42:43.438 --> 42:47.734
Oh, my God, dude, what the -
'Alex, are you OK?'
Holy fuck!

42:47.817 --> 42:50.653
Did you not hear that?
Dude, I didn't hear anything.

42:50.737 --> 42:52.322
All I heard was you yelling.

42:52.405 --> 42:54.949
I've never heard him scream
like that.

42:55.033 --> 42:58.328
Dude, that was the loudest pound
I've ever heard on a door

42:58.411 --> 43:02.415
and you didn't hear it at all.
Dude, what the fuck is happening?

43:02.499 --> 43:05.460
I'm trying really hard
not to freak out.

43:05.543 --> 43:08.004
If that's you, Susie,
you don't need to be shy.

43:08.088 --> 43:12.008
I know you're over there.
You're right by my camera.

43:12.092 --> 43:16.096
If you step into the hallway here,
this music box will go off.

43:16.179 --> 43:19.307
If it's open,
it'll like it's hard...

43:19.391 --> 43:21.476
(BEEP)
Oh, my God.

43:21.559 --> 43:23.353
Susie?

43:23.436 --> 43:25.522
(BEEP)
Right there.

43:26.648 --> 43:29.526
Are you poking your head
in and out of this hallway?

43:31.695 --> 43:33.780
Can you do it again?

43:38.702 --> 43:41.996
I don't think I'm gonna get
any sleep tonight.

43:43.707 --> 43:47.919
The sun is definitely coming up
and I'm getting the hell outta here.

43:48.003 --> 43:50.171
No elongated wrap-up,

43:50.255 --> 43:54.092
I'm not gonna sit here and talk,
I'm just getting out.

43:54.175 --> 43:56.261
Let's get outta here.

43:56.344 --> 43:59.389
Are you OK?
I'm just ready to go.

44:03.768 --> 44:06.146
When I decided to come back
to Edinburgh,

44:06.229 --> 44:08.189
this was all about redemption.

44:08.273 --> 44:11.234
I felt like I personally needed
to conquer this place.

44:12.819 --> 44:16.489
Having heard all the stories
from Alex and Dakota first hand,

44:16.573 --> 44:18.700
I was extremely worried
for this building.

44:18.783 --> 44:20.827
And I'm glad that we took it on
as a group.

44:20.910 --> 44:24.873
It shows not only growth over time,

44:24.956 --> 44:28.793
but it also shows that we're able to
face the things that scare us

44:28.877 --> 44:31.713
and find the victories
along the way.

44:31.796 --> 44:34.424
We were messing with darkness
last night,

44:34.507 --> 44:36.301
non-human entities.

44:36.384 --> 44:39.429
But that's exactly what we needed
going forward.

44:40.889 --> 44:44.976
I do understand why my brother
ran out of this building

44:45.060 --> 44:46.353
six years ago.

44:46.436 --> 44:48.772
The second I stepped foot
in the basement

44:48.855 --> 44:51.316
I felt the exact same gut feeling
as he did.

44:51.399 --> 44:54.152
The EVPs that we caught last night

44:54.235 --> 44:56.988
were unlike anything
we have ever heard.

44:57.072 --> 44:59.199
I just don't know how to explain it.

44:59.282 --> 45:02.911
Hearing that laugh, it scared
the living hell out of all of us.

45:02.994 --> 45:08.792
I had to face The Joker head on
for multiple hours all by myself.

45:08.875 --> 45:11.544
But I really do feel
leaving Edinburgh

45:11.628 --> 45:14.130
that I got the redemption
that I needed.

45:14.214 --> 45:17.258
We've hit seven locations already.

45:17.342 --> 45:18.968
And we've only got one more left.

45:19.052 --> 45:20.845
Dakota's picking the last one.

45:20.929 --> 45:23.306
I don't know what he's got
up his sleeve.

45:23.390 --> 45:27.477
Dakota is not going to hold back
for the final location.

45:27.560 --> 45:30.855
So getting through last night,
and the feeling of accomplishment

45:30.939 --> 45:34.025
I have right now
will personally help me

45:34.109 --> 45:35.902
to finish this out strong.

45:35.985 --> 45:39.489
This last stop,
it will change everything.
