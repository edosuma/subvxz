00:46.874 --> 00:48.117
Set the sight all over.

00:48.117 --> 00:49.394
- Here's the most
recent imaging.

00:55.262 --> 00:57.057
- It's like they
were aiming for us.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.507
- We've confirmed sightings
just outside Boston.

00:59.507 --> 01:01.406
Delta One has just lost signal.

01:01.406 --> 01:03.856
- We have Delta Two on sight
at the crash in Ambridge.

01:03.856 --> 01:05.065
It's about to transmit, sir--

01:05.065 --> 01:06.652
Guys, you hear me?

01:06.652 --> 01:07.481
- One spring.

01:08.413 --> 01:09.241
This is Delta Two,

01:09.241 --> 01:10.173
we are on site.

01:10.173 --> 01:12.727
Meadows, Meadows are you there?

01:13.935 --> 01:15.282
- Vasquez, I'm
here, is that you?

01:15.282 --> 01:16.490
Copy that.

01:18.630 --> 01:21.633
There's a lot of
debris around here.

01:24.049 --> 01:25.119
- Be careful.

01:26.534 --> 01:29.813
Copy that, sir.

01:29.813 --> 01:31.298
The signal on the monitor shows

01:31.298 --> 01:34.784
that the descent was
correct, it's directly ahead.

01:34.784 --> 01:37.442
Proceeding with caution.

01:37.442 --> 01:39.961
Meadows, we can't
seem to get through.

01:39.961 --> 01:42.447
There's something approaching.

01:46.899 --> 01:47.797
Fitz, Fitz.

01:49.281 --> 01:52.905
There's smoke all
around us, Meadows.

01:54.976 --> 01:57.393
- What's going on, Delta Two?

01:57.393 --> 02:00.361
Meadows, Meadows,
there's simply the smoke.

02:00.361 --> 02:01.604
The deceased...

02:02.639 --> 02:03.951
Oh my god, run.

02:03.951 --> 02:05.228
Run goddammit, run.

02:05.228 --> 02:07.230
Delta Two,
can you see what it is?

02:07.230 --> 02:09.612
No, run.

02:09.612 --> 02:10.820
Kill 'em slow.

02:10.820 --> 02:11.924
We'll be down below us.

02:11.924 --> 02:12.649
It's an--
- Meadows, Meadows.

02:13.581 --> 02:14.651
- Vasquez.

02:14.651 --> 02:15.480
Delta Two.

03:54.061 --> 03:54.889
- Please don't.

03:58.307 --> 03:59.169
Tonight.

04:01.379 --> 04:03.104
Please don't push.

04:03.104 --> 04:04.761
I just, I don't.

04:04.761 --> 04:05.969
I don't need it tonight.

04:05.969 --> 04:08.075
- What do you want
me to say, CJ?

04:08.075 --> 04:09.007
You want me to say yes, sir,

04:09.007 --> 04:10.111
like you're my fucking father?

04:10.111 --> 04:10.940
No.

04:12.113 --> 04:15.220
That's not that
what I asked you.

04:15.220 --> 04:16.117
Right.

04:16.117 --> 04:17.360
- You--

04:17.360 --> 04:18.291
You don't
want me to say fuck

04:18.291 --> 04:19.259
when I'm having a conversation?

04:19.259 --> 04:20.639
- That's not what I said either.

04:20.639 --> 04:21.846
- When I'm angry?
- Are we in the same room.

04:21.846 --> 04:23.228
- Right, okay.
- Are we talking--

04:23.228 --> 04:24.678
- How 'bout I just shut up?
- The same people?

04:24.678 --> 04:25.610
- All of my emotions.
- Also not what I asked--

04:25.610 --> 04:26.645
- So that you--
- You to do.

04:26.645 --> 04:27.888
- Can ignore yours.
- No.

04:27.888 --> 04:28.820
What I'm asking you
to do is very simple.

04:28.820 --> 04:30.304
Okay, all right.

04:30.304 --> 04:31.547
- All I'm asking to you to do
is just leave it be tonight

04:31.547 --> 04:33.031
so that I can have a
night with my friends.

04:33.031 --> 04:33.963
Well, we know
that I can't have a rational

04:33.963 --> 04:35.275
conversation according to you.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.310
- Not right now, apparently.
- Right, okay.

04:36.310 --> 04:37.794
Okay, fuck off, CJ.

04:37.794 --> 04:39.209
- What?
- God.

04:39.209 --> 04:43.869
I'm so sick of you critiquing
everything that I say.

04:43.869 --> 04:45.319
- Critiquing what?
- Everything.

04:45.319 --> 04:46.941
We can't ever just
have a conversation.

04:46.941 --> 04:49.116
Is what I'm saying.
- What the hell do you think?

04:49.116 --> 04:50.635
How the hell do you think I feel

04:50.635 --> 04:52.430
about coming home every day.
- Okay, here it is.

04:52.430 --> 04:54.155
- After 15 hours at a desk--
- I know.

04:54.155 --> 04:55.225
- That I hate.
- That's your choice.

04:55.225 --> 04:56.434
That's not mine, CJ.
- Yeah.

04:56.434 --> 04:57.366
Working with a boss
who hates himself.

04:57.366 --> 04:58.298
- I know, you're miserable.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.816
Coming back to this,

04:59.816 --> 05:01.024
and then you treat me like
a fucking piece of shit.

05:01.024 --> 05:02.854
- Why don't you just leave?

05:02.854 --> 05:03.682
- Leave?

05:06.306 --> 05:08.308
Just leave,
CJ, if you are--

05:08.308 --> 05:09.723
- So that's your answer.

05:09.723 --> 05:11.172
That miserable,
yeah, just leave.

05:11.172 --> 05:12.277
- That's your constructive
advice for our current situation

05:12.277 --> 05:15.004
is just leave, just run away?

05:16.557 --> 05:17.834
Which is apparently
what you're good at.

05:17.834 --> 05:18.766
Yeah, okay.

05:18.766 --> 05:20.147
- It might be the only thing.

05:23.012 --> 05:24.531
Fuck.

05:24.531 --> 05:25.739
- All right, now he's cursing.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.398
Fucking impossible.

06:02.154 --> 06:03.466
- You promised to love me.

06:07.608 --> 06:09.058
- I didn't break a promise.

06:09.058 --> 06:10.784
I've never broken
a promise to you.

06:13.096 --> 06:14.891
- I can feel you
don't anymore, CJ.

06:14.891 --> 06:16.065
- I can't help what you feel.

06:16.065 --> 06:17.411
- And I fucking--
- I can't--

06:17.411 --> 06:18.826
- Hate you for that.
- All you can trust me but I--

06:18.826 --> 06:20.897
- Fucking hate you.
- Can't help what you feel.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.664
- I can't do this anymore.

06:34.704 --> 06:37.604
- This, what is this?

06:37.604 --> 06:38.432
- This.
- What is this?

06:38.432 --> 06:39.882
- CJ, this whole thing.

06:42.885 --> 06:43.713
I can't.

06:52.826 --> 06:54.724
- Are you asking?

06:54.724 --> 06:56.933
Are you asking for what I
think you're asking for?

06:58.728 --> 06:59.557
Yeah?

07:02.387 --> 07:04.113
You just want me to leave.

07:04.113 --> 07:05.355
You just want to
throw everything away.

07:05.355 --> 07:06.287
Everything we've worked for.

07:06.287 --> 07:07.392
- You did this to us, CJ.

07:07.392 --> 07:08.428
- Years.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.808
You want someone to blame.

07:11.189 --> 07:13.225
You want someone to
blame, okay, fine.

07:13.225 --> 07:14.261
I'll pack my shit tonight.

07:14.261 --> 07:15.089
- Good.

07:15.089 --> 07:16.539
- I'll leave tonight.

07:16.539 --> 07:17.782
That's what you want.
- Mm hm.

07:17.782 --> 07:19.473
- All right.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.272
- Fuck.

07:40.218 --> 07:42.116
Hey, what are you
doing out so late?

07:43.877 --> 07:45.050
Okay, bye.

07:50.677 --> 07:53.680
- It's actually really funny
that you asked about that

07:53.680 --> 07:56.130
because with everything
we've been going through

07:56.130 --> 07:57.925
and all the packing.
- Hey.

07:57.925 --> 07:58.926
- Hi!

07:58.926 --> 08:00.238
Yeah.

08:00.238 --> 08:01.688
- Hi.
- CJ, how are you?

08:01.688 --> 08:04.138
- It's good, how are you?
- Good.

08:04.138 --> 08:05.554
Good to see you.
- How's it going, man?

08:05.554 --> 08:06.555
- Hey, Danny, it's
been a while, man.

08:06.555 --> 08:07.866
- Yeah.
- Been busy.

08:07.866 --> 08:09.247
- Monica.
- How are you?

08:09.247 --> 08:10.559
- Hey.
- Hi, CJ.

08:10.559 --> 08:11.594
- How you doing, man?
- Doing well.

08:11.594 --> 08:13.216
How 'bout yourself?

08:13.216 --> 08:14.977
- Long day.
- You look beautiful.

08:14.977 --> 08:16.910
- I brought you a
bottle of something.

08:16.910 --> 08:18.394
- You guys didn't have to do,

08:18.394 --> 08:20.500
you do know we're
not dying, right?

08:20.500 --> 08:22.950
It's a easy 90 minute
flight by plane.

08:22.950 --> 08:24.711
- Right, right.
- This is true.

08:24.711 --> 08:26.920
- When we can afford
plane tickets,

08:26.920 --> 08:29.198
and time away,
we'll be up there.

08:29.198 --> 08:31.752
- Yeah, we have the jet
set money, you stud.

08:32.822 --> 08:34.099
- It's Boston, guys,

08:34.099 --> 08:35.100
so if you think about it,

08:35.100 --> 08:36.515
when you break it all down.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.691
I think I'm making less money,

08:39.691 --> 08:41.244
but it's still a promotion,

08:41.244 --> 08:42.693
so that's something, right?

08:42.693 --> 08:43.799
Okay, well then
think of this as your last

08:43.799 --> 08:45.525
good bottle of red forever.

08:46.491 --> 08:47.527
- Switch to the cheap stuff,

08:47.527 --> 08:49.425
you know, that Mad Dog.
- Right.

08:49.425 --> 08:50.668
- Do you need a drink?
- Right.

08:50.668 --> 08:52.117
- Yes, I think we
need to go drink.

08:52.117 --> 08:54.326
- I'm going with them.
- Yeah, go.

08:56.052 --> 08:59.090
Well, if it's as good
as you say it is,

08:59.090 --> 09:01.023
no one minds, I'm going
to pop this fucker open.

09:01.023 --> 09:02.645
- I insist.
- Please.

09:02.645 --> 09:05.268
- Actually if you
do not mind waiting,

09:05.268 --> 09:07.339
we have one open
already for dinner,

09:07.339 --> 09:09.687
so if we save it
for after dinner,

09:09.687 --> 09:11.274
since it's gonna be good.

09:11.274 --> 09:13.276
- Party pooper.
- Party...

09:13.276 --> 09:14.415
Party pooper.

09:15.313 --> 09:16.314
- What's going on here?

09:17.418 --> 09:18.350
- Well, we don't know.

09:18.350 --> 09:20.387
We just started watching it.

09:22.009 --> 09:23.977
Some gas leak or
something near Hanover.

09:23.977 --> 09:25.565
- Gas leak?
- I don't know.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.326
It's been on for the last hour.

09:28.326 --> 09:30.811
It looks bad but
they've been saying

09:30.811 --> 09:32.572
that they're gonna
contain it, so.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.125
- That's good, 'cause
that's not a quality

09:34.125 --> 09:35.851
you want in gas.
- No.

09:35.851 --> 09:37.646
- An industrial level.
- Right.

09:37.646 --> 09:38.854
- If they can--
- No.

09:38.854 --> 09:40.856
- Can I just put
my keys on here?

09:40.856 --> 09:42.547
- Oh, yeah, throw 'em anywhere.

09:42.547 --> 09:43.479
Doesn't matter.

09:43.479 --> 09:44.998
- I would love that, thank you.

09:44.998 --> 09:46.206
- Here you go.
- Hey, babe.

09:46.206 --> 09:48.346
I'm just gonna
show CJ the thing.

09:49.554 --> 09:51.591
- Oh, yeah, that's
fine, that's fine.

09:51.591 --> 09:55.491
It has been this weird
sway of emotions all week.

09:55.491 --> 09:56.699
One minute we're fine,

09:56.699 --> 09:58.459
and the next, I am
bawling my eyes out

09:58.459 --> 10:00.461
because I'm packing
up the mug you gave me

10:00.461 --> 10:02.187
in the fourth grade.

10:02.187 --> 10:04.086
- I can imagine.

10:04.086 --> 10:04.914
- I can't.

10:04.914 --> 10:05.984
- Hey, Danny.

10:05.984 --> 10:07.468
- Oh.

10:07.468 --> 10:08.677
- It's works.
- I'm sorry.

10:08.677 --> 10:09.885
- Okay.

10:09.885 --> 10:10.817
- What, I thought
you stood it already.

10:10.817 --> 10:12.197
- I want to tell you in person.

10:13.371 --> 10:14.199
I'm pregnant.

10:15.476 --> 10:16.305
- Soph.

10:17.409 --> 10:19.515
My good, you put
that down, come here.

10:19.515 --> 10:20.343
My god.

10:21.690 --> 10:23.623
- Thanks.
- Amazing.

10:23.623 --> 10:24.900
The timing is perfect.

10:24.900 --> 10:27.074
- Oh, I know, it'll give
me time to get settled,

10:27.074 --> 10:28.628
get things together,
get a room together.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.078
I mean, Eric wasn't keen
about the whole idea,

10:31.078 --> 10:33.563
but that is our deal, so.

10:33.563 --> 10:36.325
- Oh, wait deal like knock me up

10:36.325 --> 10:38.154
and I'll move to
Boston, that deal?

10:38.154 --> 10:40.191
- Yes.
- What?

10:40.191 --> 10:42.780
I think it's this 1950s
mentality they have going on.

10:42.780 --> 10:45.921
You sacrificed enough for him.

10:45.921 --> 10:47.854
- Look, I just think
that you're pissed

10:47.854 --> 10:49.303
because I get to be a mom

10:49.303 --> 10:51.720
and no one will
put a baby in you.

10:52.755 --> 10:54.377
- Danny would, right?

10:55.447 --> 10:56.897
Danny?

10:56.897 --> 10:58.312
- I will, eventually.

11:00.245 --> 11:02.040
- Well, I am just glad
you guys are here.

11:02.040 --> 11:04.008
The people we give a shit about.

11:04.008 --> 11:06.320
Eric's coworkers threw
this party for him at work,

11:06.320 --> 11:08.219
and I am so glad to be leaving

11:08.219 --> 11:10.428
half of those people, I swear.

11:10.428 --> 11:13.293
- That's what happens when
you're the trophy wife.

11:13.293 --> 11:15.709
Well, I have been
to enough of those parties.

11:15.709 --> 11:17.573
It is just nice to
have five minutes

11:17.573 --> 11:21.163
for food and wine, even
if I can't drink it and--

11:21.163 --> 11:22.854
We'll
drink it for you.

11:24.338 --> 11:27.031
Oh my gosh, I'm
not thinking about Boston.

11:27.031 --> 11:29.171
The realtor up there is
actually a bit of a dick.

11:29.171 --> 11:34.141
I mean, Nina, you all right?

11:36.178 --> 11:39.422
- I'm sorry, Soph, I know
tonight's your night.

11:39.422 --> 11:41.217
- What happened?
- I just, I can't get excited.

11:41.217 --> 11:42.943
Did you guys
have another fight?

11:44.151 --> 11:45.670
- We're getting a divorce.

11:45.670 --> 11:47.189
What?

11:47.189 --> 11:49.122
- Jesus Christ.
- Wait, wait--

11:49.122 --> 11:50.951
- Nina, I'm so sorry.

11:50.951 --> 11:52.228
- Did he said he wanted it?

11:52.228 --> 11:54.817
- He said he's moving
out tomorrow, so, yeah.

11:54.817 --> 11:55.784
Pretty sure that he wants it.

11:55.784 --> 11:57.268
That fucking asshole.

11:57.268 --> 11:58.545
Stop it.

11:58.545 --> 12:00.167
- You have put up
with so much, Nina.

12:00.167 --> 12:02.618
I swear, you have to
get half his stuff.

12:02.618 --> 12:03.861
The car.
- Okay.

12:03.861 --> 12:05.103
- The house, you gotta
look out for yourself.

12:05.103 --> 12:07.278
- I will, thank you, I will.

12:07.278 --> 12:10.177
- You know what, Boston
is a 90 minute flight.

12:10.177 --> 12:11.489
And once we get settled,

12:11.489 --> 12:12.801
if you wanna come
up for a while,

12:12.801 --> 12:14.147
you know you can.

12:14.147 --> 12:15.355
- You should do that.

12:15.355 --> 12:16.528
- I'm not, you just
moved out there,

12:16.528 --> 12:17.529
I'm not gonna do that to you.

12:17.529 --> 12:18.772
- I can deal with Eric.

12:18.772 --> 12:20.740
- Yeah, besides, it'd be
good for you and Sophie.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.189
- It's true.

12:22.189 --> 12:23.673
Besides, I need somebody
to hang out with

12:23.673 --> 12:26.055
while he's at work, I
mean, we can go shopping,

12:26.055 --> 12:28.023
and we can get the
house together and--

12:28.023 --> 12:29.024
- Okay.

12:29.024 --> 12:30.163
Okay, I will think about it.

12:30.163 --> 12:30.957
- I need you.
- I'll think about it.

12:32.406 --> 12:33.891
- Okay.

12:33.891 --> 12:35.099
- Just don't try to think
about it tonight, okay?

12:35.099 --> 12:37.273
- Yes, don't let
it ruin everything,

12:37.273 --> 12:41.277
and I know that this is
easier said than done,

12:41.277 --> 12:45.350
but this is our last
night here for a while,

12:45.350 --> 12:47.283
and I want you to
enjoy it, okay?

12:48.698 --> 12:49.941
- Okay.

12:49.941 --> 12:51.943
- So you're gonna
sit by me at dinner

12:51.943 --> 12:55.119
and tomorrow, we are going
to figure all this out.

12:56.292 --> 12:57.604
- Okay.

12:57.604 --> 12:58.536
- And we're here for you.
- I know.

12:58.536 --> 12:59.675
- Absolutely.
- No.

12:59.675 --> 13:00.676
- Here for you.

13:00.676 --> 13:01.884
- We can hug now.

13:01.884 --> 13:03.955
- Wait, wait, wait,
I love you guys, too.

13:03.955 --> 13:06.889
Danny?
- It's gonna be okay.

13:06.889 --> 13:07.994
You want in on this?

13:07.994 --> 13:09.547
Come on.
- I'm good.

13:09.547 --> 13:10.997
Come on.

13:10.997 --> 13:11.825
- Okay.

13:14.448 --> 13:16.071
You guys are huggers.

13:17.417 --> 13:22.422
- Oh, what, goddammit, Eric.

13:23.526 --> 13:25.080
- I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to break up

13:25.080 --> 13:26.460
the little lesbian powwow,

13:26.460 --> 13:28.911
and Danny, I do
include you in on that.

13:28.911 --> 13:30.602
- What do you want, babe?

13:30.602 --> 13:34.054
- I was wondering if you
could pop the merlot.

13:34.054 --> 13:36.608
Let it breathe before dinner.

13:36.608 --> 13:37.817
- Absolutely.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.197
After all, that's what
I'm here for, right?

13:39.197 --> 13:40.923
- All right, it's okay,
we'll take care of it.

13:40.923 --> 13:42.304
We got it, all right.

13:42.304 --> 13:43.443
Don't worry about it.
- Here, I'll get it.

13:43.443 --> 13:45.031
Let me grab this one.
- Yeah.

13:45.031 --> 13:46.239
We're going.
- All right, let's go.

13:50.622 --> 13:53.108
- She told me to leave.

13:53.108 --> 13:54.903
- Just like that,
she wants you out.

13:56.180 --> 13:57.595
- Just like that.

14:00.736 --> 14:01.564
- That's tough.

14:03.704 --> 14:05.845
Do you wanna stay here tonight?

14:07.605 --> 14:09.710
- No, no it's okay.

14:09.710 --> 14:12.472
I'm moving out anyway,
so I should probably--

14:12.472 --> 14:14.336
- Right.
- Start figuring things out.

14:15.820 --> 14:16.648
It's just...

14:18.650 --> 14:20.307
It's just been
brewing for a while.

14:21.619 --> 14:22.896
- Yeah.

14:22.896 --> 14:23.932
- You know.
- Yeah.

14:23.932 --> 14:26.279
You tried, so...

14:27.590 --> 14:28.695
Well, what can you do?

14:29.592 --> 14:30.490
- It doesn't feel that way.

14:31.940 --> 14:36.461
- Well, you know, you just
take it one step at a time

14:38.084 --> 14:40.362
and it's a mountain, you know,

14:40.362 --> 14:41.604
you gotta climb that mountain,

14:41.604 --> 14:44.676
so you put one foot
in front of the other,

14:44.676 --> 14:46.609
you take the steps,
you'll get to the top.

14:46.609 --> 14:47.438
You'll feel better.

14:47.438 --> 14:49.543
It sucks, dude, I know,

14:49.543 --> 14:53.547
and I'm sorry that I have
to go deal with Sophie

14:53.547 --> 14:57.137
right now while you're dealing
with this all by yourself.

14:57.137 --> 14:59.346
I hate that, I don't
wanna do that to you,

15:00.313 --> 15:01.245
but you know...

15:04.351 --> 15:05.180
- Thanks, man.

15:06.284 --> 15:09.425
You really put things
in perspective.

15:10.599 --> 15:13.084
I just really want you
and Sophie to be happy.

15:14.879 --> 15:17.468
- Yeah, that remains to be seen,

15:17.468 --> 15:18.400
but you know what dude?

15:18.400 --> 15:20.505
Fuck all that other shit.

15:20.505 --> 15:22.922
I got you, too, okay?

15:22.922 --> 15:26.132
I got your back, any time,
just not right now, though,

15:26.132 --> 15:31.137
not in this exact moment
because of Sophinator,

15:32.000 --> 15:33.760
but another point in time,

15:33.760 --> 15:37.384
tonight definitely,
we'll recycle back.

15:37.384 --> 15:38.351
Hey, guys,
dinner's ready.

15:38.351 --> 15:39.248
- Awesome.
- Great.

15:39.248 --> 15:40.732
- Great.
- Yep.

15:40.732 --> 15:42.803
- So let's go make our
way to that, we're coming.

15:48.706 --> 15:50.915
- Thanks for doing all this,
Soph, this bread looks great.

15:50.915 --> 15:52.813
- Absolutely.
- Oh, hey.

15:52.813 --> 15:54.850
- This looks amazing.
- It look good?

15:54.850 --> 15:58.750
All right, everybody
sit down and remember,

15:58.750 --> 16:01.063
let's agree, no
talking about work.

16:01.063 --> 16:02.513
- Seconded, absolutely.
- Yes.

16:02.513 --> 16:04.549
- Wait, guys, guy.
- Jesus Christ.

16:04.549 --> 16:07.483
- Does the move count as work?
- Goddammit.

16:07.483 --> 16:10.176
- I'm just asking, I'm sorry.
- Wine anybody?

16:10.176 --> 16:12.281
- I'm just asking.
- No, I'm good, I'm good.

16:12.281 --> 16:14.111
The
attic and the sink,

16:14.111 --> 16:15.767
but we're gonna save
that for the end, so...

16:15.767 --> 16:17.010
- Yeah.

16:17.010 --> 16:17.769
Everything has
to be perfect and clean

16:17.769 --> 16:19.012
for the realtor.

16:19.012 --> 16:19.909
- Of course, of course.
- Do you guys need help?

16:19.909 --> 16:21.221
You have so much to do.

16:21.221 --> 16:23.154
- No, we're fine.
- Are you sure?

16:23.154 --> 16:24.500
- Yeah, no.
- We don't mind.

16:24.500 --> 16:25.985
- Be happy to pitch in.
- Yeah.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.608
- Plus I got this big, strong
man here to help me anyways.

16:28.608 --> 16:30.230
- Right, strong man.
- Oh, sure.

16:31.335 --> 16:32.888
- Hey, he's stronger
than he looks.

16:32.888 --> 16:35.063
I'll be around, is
all I'm saying, you know.

16:37.237 --> 16:41.690
- All right, okay, let's
just get this over with.

16:41.690 --> 16:43.830
Decided to put us
neck deep in it

16:43.830 --> 16:45.487
in the first 20 seconds.

16:45.487 --> 16:47.489
- I was just--
- Gonna give a speech.

16:47.489 --> 16:48.697
Are you kidding me, man?

16:48.697 --> 16:49.905
- Simmer down, you'll know it.

16:49.905 --> 16:51.010
State of the
union over here.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.183
- All right, relax.
- Come on.

16:52.183 --> 16:53.702
Let him say it.
- Lend me your ears.

16:53.702 --> 16:56.877
So here's to Eric and
Sophie, all right.

16:56.877 --> 16:58.431
We know you're only
a two hour flight

16:58.431 --> 17:01.710
away in Boston and some of
us will wish it was farther.

17:01.710 --> 17:03.091
- Hey, what?
- Yeah.

17:03.091 --> 17:05.990
- Here's a treat,
seriously, though, guys.

17:05.990 --> 17:07.164
We love you guys.
- Yes.

17:07.164 --> 17:08.958
And we're
gonna miss you.

17:09.959 --> 17:11.133
From all the
bullshitting we've done

17:11.133 --> 17:14.102
around this table to
the late night parties,

17:14.102 --> 17:15.550
that last till four AM.

17:15.550 --> 17:17.829
- I have the pictures.
- Can't remember half of it.

17:17.829 --> 17:19.210
Rather not.
- Let's not go there.

17:19.210 --> 17:22.420
To the nights
spent smoking cigars

17:22.420 --> 17:26.561
on your porch, we
love you guys so much,

17:26.561 --> 17:29.841
and we're gonna miss you a lot.

17:29.841 --> 17:31.084
Yeah.

17:31.084 --> 17:33.914
But rest
easy knowing that

17:33.914 --> 17:36.814
once Sophie finally
gets to Boston,

17:36.814 --> 17:38.574
she finally gets to be a mom.

17:38.574 --> 17:40.197
Thank you so
much, that was a great--

17:40.197 --> 17:42.233
- Wait a second, hold on--
- Richard.

17:42.233 --> 17:43.683
- Hold on, whoa, whoa.
- What?

17:43.683 --> 17:45.271
- Let's back it up, I'm missing
something, what happened?

17:45.271 --> 17:46.410
- You haven't told him yet?

17:46.410 --> 17:47.687
No, I
forgot to mention it.

17:47.687 --> 17:49.206
- Is that right?
- You forgot?

17:49.206 --> 17:50.483
- I'm sorry.
- It's only a baby.

17:50.483 --> 17:51.725
I mean, why not.

17:51.725 --> 17:53.693
Eric
put a baby in me.

17:53.693 --> 17:56.661
Oh my god, wow.

17:56.661 --> 17:58.146
Holy shit.
- Yeah.

18:00.734 --> 18:02.529
- I'm sorry.
- That was great.

18:02.529 --> 18:04.048
- Thank you.

18:04.048 --> 18:04.980
- I'm very happy for you.

18:04.980 --> 18:06.050
Did not think that was possible.

18:06.050 --> 18:07.983
Like, at all.
- Right, right?

18:07.983 --> 18:09.157
I'm not the only one.

18:09.157 --> 18:11.400
- No, but goddammit,
congratulations.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.850
- Thank you.
- That's amazing.

18:12.850 --> 18:14.403
- Yeah.
- It's good.

18:14.403 --> 18:16.164
Exciting.
- Yeah.

18:18.304 --> 18:21.030
Here's to Eric and
him being a daddy, cheers.

18:21.030 --> 18:22.273
- Cheers.

18:22.273 --> 18:23.688
Cheers to
Sophie being a mom.

18:23.688 --> 18:24.931
And all of us being
aunts and uncles.

18:24.931 --> 18:25.863
- Finally.
- Can't forget about us.

18:25.863 --> 18:27.899
Right?
- Finally.

18:27.899 --> 18:28.728
- Yeah.
- Little who moment,

18:28.728 --> 18:29.660
if I've ever heard one.

18:29.660 --> 18:30.937
- Wow.
- Really?

18:30.937 --> 18:32.732
- Someone doesn't
sound very happy.

18:32.732 --> 18:34.527
Sound like
an obligation, Eric.

18:34.527 --> 18:35.735
- It's not an oblig...

18:35.735 --> 18:37.288
No, guys, it's fine.
- Right.

18:37.288 --> 18:38.910
- I'm happy.
- You know.

18:38.910 --> 18:40.878
Is that your happy voice?
- I'm happy.

18:40.878 --> 18:42.086
It's good, it's good.

18:42.086 --> 18:44.019
Look, it's all
apart of the plan.

18:44.019 --> 18:45.227
It's all apart of the plan.

18:45.227 --> 18:48.057
I get my promotion,
Sophie gets her baby,

18:48.057 --> 18:49.680
we get a family.

18:49.680 --> 18:51.337
It's all happening,
the American dream,

18:51.337 --> 18:54.305
mommies, daddies,
aunts, uncles, one, two.

18:54.305 --> 18:56.204
That's what I'm saying.
- Cheers, everybody.

18:56.204 --> 18:59.138
- To romance.
- And to love.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.831
- All of it, and we are
gonna miss all of you guys.

19:02.831 --> 19:04.212
- We're gonna miss you.
- I mean it.

19:04.212 --> 19:05.799
- Me too.
- Well, most of you.

19:07.111 --> 19:08.250
- Yeah, I see how this is.

19:08.250 --> 19:10.149
Lovely speech, okay.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.667
- You dish it out but
you can't take it.

19:11.667 --> 19:14.808
- Well, you know, it really
started to hit us today.

19:14.808 --> 19:16.224
- Like what, like how?

19:16.224 --> 19:18.536
- We were taking down
pictures with photo albums,

19:18.536 --> 19:20.020
I mean...
- That must be hard.

19:20.020 --> 19:21.160
- Well, you know, sometimes,
you just have to pack up

19:21.160 --> 19:22.575
and move on.
- Yeah.

19:22.575 --> 19:24.301
- Things run their course.

19:24.301 --> 19:26.786
- Kind of like you
guys, right, right?

19:37.176 --> 19:38.763
Guys, I'm sorry.

19:40.075 --> 19:41.352
- It's fine, it was
bound to come out.

19:41.352 --> 19:42.698
- I didn't mean to say it.
- It's okay.

19:42.698 --> 19:43.837
It's all right.

19:43.837 --> 19:46.150
- Guys, things
happen, let's just...

19:46.150 --> 19:47.324
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:47.324 --> 19:49.257
Let's just
have fun tonight.

19:49.257 --> 19:50.534
- Let's just try
to enjoy our night.

19:50.534 --> 19:51.466
Can you pass the dip?
- Yeah.

19:51.466 --> 19:52.432
- Actually.
- Here.

19:52.432 --> 19:54.193
- Thank you.
- Mm hmm.

19:56.885 --> 19:59.198
- It's actually really good.

20:05.514 --> 20:07.551
I'd like to
talk about this.

20:07.551 --> 20:08.793
- CJ, I'm sorry I'm started--

20:08.793 --> 20:09.760
I'd like to
talk about this.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.002
No.
- Come on, let it go.

20:11.002 --> 20:11.831
No, I'd like
to talk about it.

20:11.831 --> 20:13.522
- Are you sure?
- Yep.

20:16.560 --> 20:18.078
I know everybody at this table

20:19.563 --> 20:21.081
has a certain perception of me

20:21.081 --> 20:24.188
based on something they
think I did or didn't do.

20:24.188 --> 20:26.294
It's true, it's fine,
it's really fine.

20:29.987 --> 20:32.541
But it's so important for me

20:32.541 --> 20:34.543
that you know that I
didn't do anything.

20:36.338 --> 20:38.306
I did not do what
you think I did.

20:47.867 --> 20:49.524
Does anyone at this
table believe me?

20:56.185 --> 20:56.979
Okay.

20:57.980 --> 20:58.809
All right.

20:59.879 --> 21:01.984
- Well, hey, CJ I believe you.

21:01.984 --> 21:02.985
- It's all right, Dan.
- Stop.

21:02.985 --> 21:04.055
- Don't worry about it.
- Don't.

21:04.055 --> 21:05.436
- Don't worry about it.

21:07.818 --> 21:10.545
Look, guys, this is
not the best time to do this.

21:10.545 --> 21:11.718
- No, I think this
is a great time.

21:11.718 --> 21:12.823
- Yeah, so Nina--
- This is a great time.

21:12.823 --> 21:14.238
- Come on.
- No, it's a great time.

21:14.238 --> 21:14.790
- Let's not do it right now.
- It's a great time.

21:15.964 --> 21:17.483
It will be like
couple's therapy.

21:17.483 --> 21:19.554
Right, CJ, remember how you
never wanted to do that?

21:19.554 --> 21:21.141
- Okay.

21:21.141 --> 21:22.039
You really
don't have to do this.

21:22.039 --> 21:23.489
- So...
- CJ, come on.

21:23.489 --> 21:24.697
It's fine.

21:24.697 --> 21:26.181
- I would love to start
off with a question.

21:26.181 --> 21:27.700
- Shoot.

21:27.700 --> 21:31.635
- Okay, why after an entire
year can you not come clean?

21:31.635 --> 21:32.567
- About what?

21:32.567 --> 21:35.570
- Okay, CJ I saw the texts.

21:35.570 --> 21:36.812
- Okay, from who?

21:36.812 --> 21:38.814
- The missed calls
from, you still?

21:40.299 --> 21:42.887
Who calls at 11
o'clock at night, CJ?

21:42.887 --> 21:44.130
- People in my life who know me.

21:44.130 --> 21:45.407
- And then hangs up
when your wife answers.

21:45.407 --> 21:46.719
Because I have a
life independent of you.

21:46.719 --> 21:47.961
- Right, okay, you
still talk to her.

21:47.961 --> 21:49.238
- Why are you
answering my phone?

21:49.238 --> 21:50.757
Of course I talk to
her, I work with her.

21:50.757 --> 21:52.552
- If you had any respect for
me, for our relationship.

21:52.552 --> 21:54.002
- Hold on, stop, stop.
- Then you would--

21:54.002 --> 21:56.142
- Stop.
- Never talk to her again.

21:56.142 --> 21:57.937
- What do you mean I would
never talk to her again?

21:57.937 --> 21:58.972
We work together?

21:58.972 --> 22:00.215
- Stop raising your voice.

22:00.215 --> 22:01.423
- We saw you, Sophie
and I saw you.

22:01.423 --> 22:02.355
- Saw what?

22:02.355 --> 22:03.529
- We saw you in your office

22:03.529 --> 22:04.875
when everybody
else had gone home.

22:04.875 --> 22:05.979
- Working?
- Who does that?

22:05.979 --> 22:06.842
Working.
- People who work.

22:06.842 --> 22:08.050
- Right, okay.
- Yes.

22:08.050 --> 22:09.189
People who work
stay late sometimes

22:09.189 --> 22:10.121
just stop.
- Did you fuck her?

22:10.121 --> 22:11.330
Did you fuck her on your desk?

22:11.330 --> 22:12.676
Were you too cheap
to buy a hotel room?

22:12.676 --> 22:13.918
Hold on, shut up.

22:13.918 --> 22:15.264
- So you fucked
her on your desk.

22:15.264 --> 22:16.196
Hold on, shut up.

22:16.196 --> 22:17.646
- Or maybe you didn't want--

22:17.646 --> 22:18.889
- You're being a fucking
awful piece of fucking shit.

22:18.889 --> 22:19.683
I can't keep my cock
in my pants 30 seconds

22:19.683 --> 22:20.925
after I leave the house.

22:20.925 --> 22:21.857
- Is that even a
question anymore?

22:21.857 --> 22:23.100
- I have no impulse control.

22:23.100 --> 22:23.859
Let me ask you a question.
- Yeah.

22:23.859 --> 22:25.033
Ask away.

22:25.033 --> 22:26.517
- Let me ask you a
motherfucking question.

22:26.517 --> 22:28.036
- I would love to answer,
I would love to answer.

22:28.036 --> 22:28.692
- Would I have been such
an awful fucking monster?

22:28.692 --> 22:29.934
- Absolutely.

22:29.934 --> 22:30.590
If I had saw any
degree of affection--

22:30.590 --> 22:32.040
- Right oh.

22:32.040 --> 22:32.834
Outside of our
goddamn nightmare hell scape

22:32.834 --> 22:33.628
of a fucking home.

22:33.628 --> 22:34.939
- You want affection?

22:34.939 --> 22:36.355
I can't even look at you.
- Anything.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.183
- I can't even look at you.
- A fucking kind word.

22:37.183 --> 22:38.391
Are you kidding me?

22:38.391 --> 22:39.910
- Without being
disgusted by you.

22:39.910 --> 22:41.360
- Fine, fuck you, fucking
crucify me if you want.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.568
- Walk away, you always do.
- Hey, hey.

22:42.568 --> 22:45.225
Nina, that's enough.
- Oh, fuck off, Danny.

22:45.225 --> 22:46.330
- All right, sit down.
- Leave her alone.

22:46.330 --> 22:47.366
Danny stop.
- Okay, thanks Danny.

22:47.366 --> 22:48.608
- Chill the fuck out.
- Thanks.

22:48.608 --> 22:50.438
- You know what?
- CJ, hey, CJ.

22:51.922 --> 22:53.372
- Are you okay, Nina?
- Can you believe him?

22:53.372 --> 22:54.269
- I'm fine.

22:54.269 --> 22:55.512
Yeah, thank you.
- Bitch.

22:55.512 --> 22:56.202
- You never should
have done this.

23:01.759 --> 23:06.074
- Man, that was...

23:06.074 --> 23:07.006
That was...

23:12.977 --> 23:15.324
Hey, man, do you wanna
stay here tonight?

23:15.324 --> 23:16.878
We will not mind the company.

23:18.466 --> 23:19.328
- No.

23:20.295 --> 23:21.123
- Are you sure?
- It's okay.

23:21.123 --> 23:21.952
- Yeah.

23:23.367 --> 23:25.404
I'm moving out anyways
so I should find a hotel.

23:26.819 --> 23:28.993
- Oh yeah, I thought you
were too cheap for a hotel.

23:29.891 --> 23:30.892
- Fuck you.

23:30.892 --> 23:31.927
- Go fuck yourself, man.

23:34.792 --> 23:37.208
- No, I'm sorry for
ruining tonight,

23:37.208 --> 23:41.420
and I don't know how things
just got out of hand.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.800
- It's okay, man.

23:47.840 --> 23:50.083
- Holy shit, you guys
heard that, right?

23:50.083 --> 23:50.912
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we all did.

23:50.912 --> 23:52.361
- We did.

23:52.361 --> 23:53.293
- That scared the
shit out of me.

23:53.293 --> 23:54.571
- Hey, did you guys hear that?

23:55.434 --> 23:56.642
- Yeah.
- Yes.

23:56.642 --> 23:57.746
It sounded
like a woman.

23:57.746 --> 23:59.507
- Did you see someone?

24:02.371 --> 24:03.580
No, no.

24:03.580 --> 24:05.029
- Did you see someone?

24:05.029 --> 24:07.066
- No, we were just standing
around talking, so...

24:13.521 --> 24:14.383
Okay.

24:15.246 --> 24:16.869
I'm gonna go out there.

24:19.492 --> 24:21.183
- I'm going with him.

24:21.183 --> 24:24.601
- Wait, guys, I don't
think this is a good idea.

24:24.601 --> 24:27.224
- Look, guys, this isn't the
best time to go playing heroes.

24:27.224 --> 24:28.605
- We're not playing hero.

24:28.605 --> 24:30.020
What if someone's
seriously hurt out there?

24:30.020 --> 24:32.229
- Well, then let someone
else call the cops.

24:33.402 --> 24:34.231
- Are you kidding, what
if it takes too long

24:34.231 --> 24:35.474
for them to get there?

24:35.474 --> 24:37.130
Look, we're just gonna
go out and make sure

24:37.130 --> 24:38.373
everything's okay.

24:38.373 --> 24:39.581
- Well, you have to stay here,

24:39.581 --> 24:41.480
and make sure that
everything stays okay.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.310
- CJ and I are gonna go,
it'll take two seconds,

24:44.310 --> 24:45.345
and Danny will be here.

24:45.345 --> 24:46.726
- Yeah, yeah, I got it.

24:46.726 --> 24:48.487
Hurry back, okay?

24:48.487 --> 24:50.489
I'll be with
CJ, it'll be okay.

25:07.989 --> 25:09.749
- They said they'd
be right back.

25:09.749 --> 25:12.407
It's been five minutes, we
haven't heard jack shit.

25:12.407 --> 25:13.995
- You know what, it's
okay, I'm going out there.

25:13.995 --> 25:16.135
- What are you talking
about, Soph, no.

25:16.135 --> 25:17.792
- I didn't say you
had to go, did you?

25:17.792 --> 25:19.310
That doesn't
mean it's a good idea.

25:19.310 --> 25:22.762
- I know, but look, it has
been what, five minutes?

25:22.762 --> 25:24.074
We haven't heard anything.

25:24.074 --> 25:26.179
No noise, no sound, anything,

25:26.179 --> 25:27.422
don't you think that's weird?

25:27.422 --> 25:28.630
- Yes, I think that's weird.

25:28.630 --> 25:30.667
That's why I'm not
going out there.

25:30.667 --> 25:32.047
- I think we should
call the police.

25:32.047 --> 25:33.532
- And tell them what?

25:33.532 --> 25:34.912
It's been five minutes.

25:34.912 --> 25:36.880
- Gonna tell them that
something is wrong out there,

25:36.880 --> 25:38.295
something is going on.

25:38.295 --> 25:39.468
You heard a
scream and you don't know--

25:39.468 --> 25:40.711
- Oh my god, you
guys, it was probably

25:40.711 --> 25:41.885
the morgues fucking
really loudly again.

25:41.885 --> 25:42.679
- Hey, don't dismiss
me like that.

25:42.679 --> 25:43.921
Something is happening.

25:43.921 --> 25:45.095
Look, I'm
not okay, I just--

25:45.095 --> 25:46.545
Something
is happening.

25:46.545 --> 25:47.546
- Monica, we're just not
all as sensitive as you are.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.755
- Really, Nina?
- I'm concerned.

25:49.755 --> 25:52.412
- Don't start, Nina, now--
- Fuck off, Danny.

25:55.415 --> 25:57.417
Nina,
no, you fuck off.

25:57.417 --> 25:58.349
Danny.

25:58.349 --> 25:59.834
- Okay, you ever stop to realize

25:59.834 --> 26:01.836
that maybe Sophie wants
to see her husband again?

26:01.836 --> 26:03.147
- What'd you say to me?

26:03.147 --> 26:04.183
- I was pretty clear.

26:04.183 --> 26:06.047
Drop the act.
- Danny--

26:06.047 --> 26:08.359
- Okay, no, this has
been a long time coming.

26:08.359 --> 26:10.465
CJ's out there trying
to be a good Samaritan,

26:10.465 --> 26:12.191
and here you could give
two shits about him.

26:12.191 --> 26:13.986
- Okay, then what are you doing
here, you fucking boy scout?

26:13.986 --> 26:15.539
- I'm trying to take care of
the people that I care about.

26:15.539 --> 26:17.299
- Right, fuck you, Danny.

26:30.934 --> 26:32.867
- What is that?

26:34.627 --> 26:35.490
- Sirens?

26:39.114 --> 26:40.668
- Are those air raid sirens?

26:42.393 --> 26:44.603
- What the hell is
an air raid siren?

26:46.121 --> 26:49.090
- Goddammit, Mon, read a book.

26:50.539 --> 26:51.782
- Oh.
- What the fuck?

26:51.782 --> 26:53.508
Who is that?

26:53.508 --> 26:54.854
- Fuck.
- Shit.

26:54.854 --> 26:56.338
Shit.

26:56.338 --> 26:59.583
- Help me, man, someone,
Danny grab the first aid kit.

26:59.583 --> 27:00.860
Close the door!

27:18.637 --> 27:20.639
- What was that, what was that?

27:20.639 --> 27:21.812
What the fuck?

27:22.710 --> 27:23.883
What was that?

27:25.022 --> 27:28.267
The fuck, what
the fuck was that?

27:31.442 --> 27:34.653
You, you, what the hell
did you bring to my door,

27:34.653 --> 27:35.792
you son of a bitch.
- Sophie, stop.

27:35.792 --> 27:37.656
- What did you say, you can't--

27:37.656 --> 27:40.486
- Back off, back
off, it's a cop.

27:40.486 --> 27:42.591
What, what the
fuck is a cop doing here?

27:42.591 --> 27:44.283
Okay, okay, Jesus.

27:44.283 --> 27:45.525
- Listen to me.
- Just calm down.

27:45.525 --> 27:47.113
Grab some towels.
- Towels, okay.

27:47.113 --> 27:50.254
- Hey, were you
shot anywhere else?

27:50.254 --> 27:51.497
- It's okay.

27:51.497 --> 27:53.050
- What's your name?

27:55.156 --> 27:56.398
- Riley.

27:56.398 --> 27:58.918
- Were you shot anywhere else?

27:58.918 --> 27:59.919
- No.

27:59.919 --> 28:02.853
- Are you hurt?
- Just there.

28:02.853 --> 28:05.028
- How bad is it?

28:05.028 --> 28:05.856
Oh my god.

28:07.030 --> 28:09.826
- Okay, so this is
what we're gonna do.

28:09.826 --> 28:11.172
I'm gonna put pressure here,

28:11.172 --> 28:12.414
and I want you to keep it there

28:12.414 --> 28:15.210
and do not move at any
circumstance, okay?

28:15.210 --> 28:16.867
Otherwise you're gonna bleed out

28:16.867 --> 28:18.869
and we're gonna call an
ambulance, call someone now--

28:18.869 --> 28:20.043
- No, no, don't.
- Fuck, no.

28:20.043 --> 28:21.458
No what?

28:22.424 --> 28:23.840
- No ambulance.

28:23.840 --> 28:26.497
- You need medical attention,
you're gonna bleed out.

28:26.497 --> 28:27.671
- They won't make
it through all that.

28:27.671 --> 28:28.534
- What?
- Won't make it through what?

28:31.917 --> 28:32.918
What's out there?

28:32.918 --> 28:33.919
What is that?

28:33.919 --> 28:34.851
- More people like that.

28:34.851 --> 28:35.886
Just get away from the windows.

28:37.646 --> 28:38.578
- What are you talking about?

28:38.578 --> 28:40.719
What did you see out there?

28:43.583 --> 28:44.723
The war.

28:44.723 --> 28:47.035
- What does that mean?

28:47.035 --> 28:47.864
- Hey.

28:58.253 --> 28:59.082
What?

29:00.946 --> 29:02.154
- No, no, don't.
- CJ, CJ, don't.

29:02.154 --> 29:05.157
Pennsylvania
crimes co-seals,

29:05.157 --> 29:07.159
you must leave.

29:07.159 --> 29:09.920
If you do not disperse,
you made be arrested

29:09.920 --> 29:12.751
and or subject to
public police action.

29:12.751 --> 29:15.408
- Sounds like a
goddamned riot out there.

29:15.408 --> 29:17.134
Fuck.

29:17.134 --> 29:18.722
- Oh my god.
- Gosh!

29:18.722 --> 29:20.310
Oh Christ.

29:26.488 --> 29:29.250
Jesus fucking Christ.
- Oh my god.

29:31.045 --> 29:33.081
- What the fuck was that?

29:34.427 --> 29:35.912
- Pittsburgh Metro got a call.

29:36.982 --> 29:39.087
There was an explosion
or something.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.609
They figured it was
just a gas leak,

29:44.575 --> 29:45.956
so they sent a few officers.

29:47.578 --> 29:49.649
- What was it, was it bomb?

29:51.617 --> 29:53.515
- That's what they thought
when they got there,

29:57.002 --> 30:00.902
but then they realized
what really happened.

30:02.835 --> 30:04.906
It was some sort
of chemical attack.

30:06.632 --> 30:07.564
- Was it terrorists?

30:09.738 --> 30:12.603
- Honestly, I don't know.
- Oh my god.

30:14.019 --> 30:16.366
- The first
responders, they called

30:16.366 --> 30:17.677
for backup in riot gear.

30:19.576 --> 30:21.060
Then they were torn to pieces.

30:24.615 --> 30:26.169
- Where are the other officers?

30:28.999 --> 30:30.829
Your team, where are
they, what happened?

30:30.829 --> 30:32.140
You guys get separated?

30:34.936 --> 30:38.837
- My partner, I lost
him in the smoke.

30:40.252 --> 30:42.150
I couldn't see a
damn thing out there.

30:43.358 --> 30:45.050
My mask is the only
reason I'm even here.

30:46.672 --> 30:47.604
The smoke, it...

30:50.055 --> 30:51.366
Made everyone go crazy.

30:53.368 --> 30:54.922
They were like goddamn animals.

30:56.509 --> 30:58.235
I'm not sure if anyone's left.

30:59.858 --> 31:00.962
The hit the whole city.

31:03.931 --> 31:05.415
They hit the whole damn city.

31:11.697 --> 31:14.079
Danny, keep
pressure on that

31:14.079 --> 31:17.220
and Monica, turn on that TV.

31:17.220 --> 31:18.635
- Okay.
- Oh shit.

31:24.952 --> 31:26.919
- Okay, guys, what the fuck?

31:32.062 --> 31:34.133
What do we do, do
we call the police,

31:34.133 --> 31:35.065
the fire department?

31:35.065 --> 31:36.066
- I don't know, did anybody hear

31:36.066 --> 31:38.034
anything about this earlier.

31:38.034 --> 31:39.276
- No.

31:39.276 --> 31:40.691
- How do we even know
he is who he says he is?

31:40.691 --> 31:41.900
- What?

31:41.900 --> 31:43.177
- The fuck are
you talking about?

31:43.177 --> 31:44.247
- He could be a fake
cop or something.

31:45.593 --> 31:47.250
- He's a cop who's
bleeding out on your floor.

31:47.250 --> 31:50.667
The fuck, what the hell
are you talking about?

31:50.667 --> 31:51.910
- I don't know.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.912
Playing up on the gas
leak, trying to rob us,

31:53.912 --> 31:55.603
kill us, there's sick
people out there.

31:55.603 --> 31:57.122
- No, people don't do that.

31:57.122 --> 31:58.330
- All right, do you want me
to go ask him for some ID

31:58.330 --> 31:59.952
while he's got a
whole in his stomach?

31:59.952 --> 32:01.574
- Anybody can buy a
badge and a costume

32:01.574 --> 32:03.024
and say, "I'm a fucking cop."

32:03.024 --> 32:04.577
- He looks pretty
fucking official.

32:04.577 --> 32:06.027
- We don't have time for this.

32:06.027 --> 32:06.959
- Oh, okay, I'm sorry, I'm
throwing something out there.

32:06.959 --> 32:08.478
- We don't have time for this.

32:08.478 --> 32:09.686
- Okay, just give us a break
all right and use your brain.

32:09.686 --> 32:11.688
You guys,
you guys, get over here.

32:16.520 --> 32:17.521
- What is it?

32:17.521 --> 32:18.626
- Listen, listen
to this, listen.

32:18.626 --> 32:19.868
Presence here.

32:19.868 --> 32:21.318
Again, if you are
just joining us,

32:21.318 --> 32:23.044
we are seeing pictures
from downtown Pittsburgh.

32:23.044 --> 32:25.322
There's been a
massive explosion,

32:25.322 --> 32:27.738
and a chemical
component of some sort

32:27.738 --> 32:29.257
has been released into the air.

32:29.257 --> 32:31.846
So far we've had 72
casualties reported

32:31.846 --> 32:34.021
in just the last
30 minutes alone.

32:34.021 --> 32:36.713
Now, we're here, just
off close to the tower,

32:36.713 --> 32:38.163
but the police are telling us

32:38.163 --> 32:40.751
we cannot move in any
further until all the gas

32:40.751 --> 32:42.650
has been cleared from the area.

32:42.650 --> 32:44.893
We are also hearing
rumors that Pennsylvania

32:44.893 --> 32:47.827
National Guard maybe called
in within the next hour.

32:47.827 --> 32:49.898
Keep in mind, David, we
are hearing this news

32:49.898 --> 32:51.486
on the back of
reports that the same

32:51.486 --> 32:54.144
sort of incident has
occurred in both Philadelphia

32:55.318 --> 32:56.940
and New York and
although we have not had

32:56.940 --> 32:59.322
official confirmation
from government officials,

32:59.322 --> 33:02.981
we are fairly certain these
are coordinated, biological--

33:02.981 --> 33:04.292
- I can't listen to this
shit, that's ridiculous.

33:04.292 --> 33:05.776
- Is this real?

33:05.776 --> 33:06.950
- Calm down, it's okay.
- Is this really happening?

33:06.950 --> 33:07.640
- It's okay.
- I wanna go home.

33:07.640 --> 33:08.848
- No, you can't.

33:08.848 --> 33:10.022
No one can.

33:10.022 --> 33:12.438
Look, we all heard
what that thing said.

33:12.438 --> 33:14.440
No one leaves this
house, you hear me?

33:15.855 --> 33:16.856
What the hell?

33:16.856 --> 33:17.857
Oh, fuck.

33:17.857 --> 33:19.825
Go on, honey, go on.

33:19.825 --> 33:21.137
- Okay.
- What is going on?

33:21.137 --> 33:22.690
- You can't see.
- Okay, I got a flashlight.

33:22.690 --> 33:24.554
- It's okay.
- Somewhere.

33:24.554 --> 33:26.107
Let's just calm down.

33:27.591 --> 33:28.799
- Fuck.
- God.

33:28.799 --> 33:29.904
What is happening?
- Lantern, okay good.

33:29.904 --> 33:31.147
- Yep, we got it.
- Good.

33:31.147 --> 33:32.424
Looks, it's all right, guys.

33:32.424 --> 33:34.667
It was probably just a
breaker or something.

33:34.667 --> 33:37.532
Bullshit, Eric,
didn't you just hear the TV?

33:37.532 --> 33:39.396
It's whatever's
going on downtown.

33:39.396 --> 33:41.364
We're eight
miles from downtown.

33:41.364 --> 33:44.539
Look, maybe it's somebody
else acting crazy

33:44.539 --> 33:46.196
but let's not jump
to conclusions.

33:46.196 --> 33:47.508
- Oh, great, conclusions?
- Yeah.

33:47.508 --> 33:51.167
- People are dying downtown.
- I know that.

33:51.167 --> 33:52.961
- What do you want
me to think, asshole?

33:52.961 --> 33:54.204
Jesus
Christ, calm down.

33:54.204 --> 33:56.586
- Calm down, I don't
want to calm down.

33:56.586 --> 34:00.107
What I want is to go home.

34:00.107 --> 34:03.179
I never even fucking wanted to
come here in the first place.

34:05.422 --> 34:08.114
- Well, she gets
points for honesty.

34:11.255 --> 34:13.120
- Wow, okay, well, let's,

34:13.120 --> 34:17.364
you know what, let's figure out
what the fuck we have to do.

34:29.998 --> 34:31.172
- Is it on the news yet?

34:33.105 --> 34:35.072
- Is that the thing
you were talking about?

34:36.833 --> 34:37.661
- I saw it.

34:39.248 --> 34:40.112
I saw it.

34:41.838 --> 34:43.426
People tearing each other apart.

34:45.806 --> 34:48.706
- Well, it's okay,
you're safe with us.

34:52.054 --> 34:52.882
- Am I?

34:57.543 --> 34:58.475
- Get down.

35:05.724 --> 35:07.346
- What the fuck was that?

35:07.346 --> 35:09.176
I don't know.

35:11.523 --> 35:13.594
Okay, hold on.
- What?

35:13.594 --> 35:14.836
- Hold on.
- Eric.

35:14.836 --> 35:16.079
- Eric.
- Eric, don't.

35:16.079 --> 35:17.149
Do not
open that door.

35:17.149 --> 35:18.357
Are you kidding?

35:18.357 --> 35:21.602
- Hey, hey, are you
with the police?

35:21.602 --> 35:22.534
We're
here to help, sir.

35:22.534 --> 35:24.294
- Are you with the police?

35:27.125 --> 35:28.609
Is everyone okay?

35:28.609 --> 35:29.989
- No, we're not okay.

35:29.989 --> 35:32.095
We have an injured Pittsburgh
metro police officer

35:32.095 --> 35:34.408
in here, he's
bleeding pretty badly.

35:34.408 --> 35:36.479
Guys, the police are here.

35:36.479 --> 35:38.929
Monica, help's here.

35:39.792 --> 35:42.001
He's right over here.

35:51.839 --> 35:53.358
Are you okay?

35:53.358 --> 35:55.325
- Besides this hole
in my fucking stomach.

35:55.325 --> 35:56.568
- Oh my god.
- Ma'am you need to back up.

35:56.568 --> 35:57.845
- What the hell is going on?

35:57.845 --> 35:58.846
- Back the fuck up.
- What is going on?

35:58.846 --> 35:59.847
- Okay.
- You need to back off.

35:59.847 --> 36:01.089
Back up before I ventilate you.

36:01.089 --> 36:02.608
- Jesus Christ.
- Okay, all right.

36:04.058 --> 36:05.232
Stay here,

36:05.232 --> 36:06.888
there's a major
gas line explosion.

36:10.202 --> 36:11.617
Look, there's more
important things

36:11.617 --> 36:12.722
going on in your neighborhood

36:12.722 --> 36:13.654
that we need to assess.

36:13.654 --> 36:15.587
Stay here, lock the door.

36:15.587 --> 36:17.278
We'll send a team down
to retrieve you guys

36:17.278 --> 36:18.900
in about 45 minutes.

36:18.900 --> 36:20.419
- 45 minutes?
- He's bleeding out.

36:20.419 --> 36:21.455
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- He doesn't have 45 minutes.

36:21.455 --> 36:22.525
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

36:22.525 --> 36:23.595
We understand.

36:24.803 --> 36:26.701
Until
then, shut the door.

36:26.701 --> 36:28.289
Lock it and don't answer it

36:28.289 --> 36:30.395
for anybody other than military.

36:30.395 --> 36:31.327
Do you copy that?

36:42.200 --> 36:43.580
45 minutes, my ass.

36:43.580 --> 36:44.581
- Fuck.

36:44.581 --> 36:45.410
Fuck.

36:49.345 --> 36:52.106
- If it's a gas leak, then
why is the military here?

37:11.505 --> 37:12.333
- Hey.

37:13.576 --> 37:15.302
- Hey, Soph.

37:15.302 --> 37:16.164
- How you doing?

37:18.408 --> 37:20.583
- I'm really sorry about that.

37:21.791 --> 37:23.413
I don't know why I
said those things.

37:24.932 --> 37:26.105
I didn't mean it.

37:26.105 --> 37:27.659
- It's okay.

37:27.659 --> 37:31.041
- No, it's not okay.

37:31.041 --> 37:34.700
I just feel like I'm
losing control, you know?

37:36.392 --> 37:38.290
- Mon, it's okay.

37:40.085 --> 37:42.329
- I just wanna get out of here.

37:42.329 --> 37:43.882
- I know, me too, all right.

37:48.542 --> 37:50.475
- Look, I promise I
won't be a bitch anymore.

37:51.648 --> 37:53.719
- Well, let's not make
promises we can't keep.

37:57.136 --> 37:59.242
Actually, we're gonna
go down to the basement.

37:59.242 --> 38:00.381
Try to see if there's
anything down there

38:00.381 --> 38:02.866
we can protect ourselves
with, anything.

38:03.798 --> 38:05.075
Why don't you come with us?

38:10.322 --> 38:11.185
- Okay.

38:13.670 --> 38:15.154
All right, let's go.

39:01.787 --> 39:04.756
- I'm so sorry, I'm so
sorry for everything.

39:04.756 --> 39:06.171
- Me too.

39:06.999 --> 39:07.828
Just don't, CJ.

39:09.174 --> 39:10.071
It's not worth it.

39:23.740 --> 39:25.949
- Hey, we're going downstairs.

39:25.949 --> 39:27.365
We're gonna try
to find something

39:27.365 --> 39:29.401
to defend ourselves
with, you know?

39:29.401 --> 39:31.610
- Yeah, okay.
- All right.

39:33.060 --> 39:34.268
- It's actually an older radio.

39:34.268 --> 39:35.373
My dad used to keep
in the basement

39:35.373 --> 39:37.375
in case of emergencies.

39:38.306 --> 39:40.067
Getting anything?

39:40.067 --> 39:40.895
- He's trying.

39:42.794 --> 39:45.383
- Echo seven, this is Riley
on an emergency frequency.

39:45.383 --> 39:46.556
Do you copy, over?

39:48.213 --> 39:51.492
Echo seven, this is Riley
on an emergency frequency.

39:51.492 --> 39:53.114
Do you copy, over?

39:54.219 --> 39:55.496
Riley, come back.

39:55.496 --> 39:57.153
This is tango six
one, come back.

39:59.224 --> 40:00.398
- Harrigan, is that you?

40:02.538 --> 40:04.056
Copy that.

40:04.056 --> 40:05.575
Good to hear your voice, Riley.

40:07.128 --> 40:09.096
- Where are you, over?

40:10.891 --> 40:13.859
We got pinned
down just outside of homestead.

40:14.722 --> 40:17.794
There's no one else, Riley.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.729
I'm holed up just off of 837.

40:21.729 --> 40:24.249
A family took in
me, Von and Chappy.

40:24.249 --> 40:26.044
Downtown core is shut down.

40:26.044 --> 40:27.321
It's just not downtown anymore.

40:27.321 --> 40:28.149
It's everywhere.

40:29.116 --> 40:30.773
You need to stay inside.

40:30.773 --> 40:33.500
It's only gonna get worse
from here on out, you hear me?

40:33.500 --> 40:34.501
Protect yourself.

40:35.433 --> 40:36.641
You can't--

40:36.641 --> 40:37.952
Protect yourself.

40:39.747 --> 40:40.576
Be safe.

40:43.441 --> 40:47.479
- Harrigan, Harrigan,
are you there?

41:05.463 --> 41:07.603
- What the hell are
we doing down here?

41:07.603 --> 41:09.052
- I just told you.

41:09.052 --> 41:12.435
We are trying to find something
to protect ourselves with.

41:12.435 --> 41:14.920
- What, like a broom or cobwebs?

41:14.920 --> 41:16.715
- I don't know, Monica.

41:16.715 --> 41:19.097
I am trying, okay?

41:19.097 --> 41:21.202
- Sorry, I'm sorry, Soph, here.

41:21.202 --> 41:22.031
Thanks.

41:24.102 --> 41:25.310
- Hey.
- What, what?

41:25.310 --> 41:26.484
Can you give
me those containers?

41:26.484 --> 41:27.830
- Those?
- Yeah.

41:27.830 --> 41:28.658
Do you see 'em?
- Yeah, yeah.

41:32.420 --> 41:33.663
- This is gonna work.
- Here, here.

41:33.663 --> 41:35.493
- Look, if we mix the
bleach and the ammonia,

41:35.493 --> 41:36.735
we can use it.

41:36.735 --> 41:38.012
- Use it as what?
- That's your idea.

41:38.012 --> 41:39.220
- If you mix them in
the same container,

41:39.220 --> 41:40.877
it becomes toxic.

41:40.877 --> 41:42.810
Then you can spray it
in the eyes of whatever

41:42.810 --> 41:45.433
those things are if
they come at you,

41:45.433 --> 41:47.401
and it gives us a chance.

41:47.401 --> 41:48.989
- Okay.
- All right.

41:48.989 --> 41:52.302
- Just to buy--
- Day is it, Sophie.

41:52.302 --> 41:53.856
- What are you saying, Nina?
- Seriously?

41:53.856 --> 41:54.857
What do you need?

41:54.857 --> 41:56.306
- I don't wanna die.

41:56.306 --> 41:57.929
- What are you saying?

41:57.929 --> 42:00.794
- We'll fucking die in
this fucking basement.

42:00.794 --> 42:02.174
- Nobody is gonna die.

42:02.174 --> 42:03.590
Nobody is gonna die, here, Nina.

42:03.590 --> 42:05.177
- Guys, I don't feel very good.

42:06.040 --> 42:07.214
- CJ?

42:07.214 --> 42:09.561
CJ is up there
trying to find a way

42:09.561 --> 42:11.908
to get us out of here,
get you out of here.

42:11.908 --> 42:13.220
- No, he's not.

42:13.220 --> 42:14.428
- Because he loves you.

42:21.815 --> 42:23.437
Yeah, I heard it.

42:25.370 --> 42:27.441
- Someone's here.

42:29.167 --> 42:30.789
- Go get Eric, now.

42:32.860 --> 42:34.068
Nina, I got this.

42:34.068 --> 42:37.520
- No, Soph, I'm staying
down here with you.

42:37.520 --> 42:38.521
- All right.

42:39.453 --> 42:40.937
Here.
- All right.

43:49.040 --> 43:50.455
No.

43:50.455 --> 43:51.905
No, no.

44:09.198 --> 44:10.095
Fuck.

44:11.614 --> 44:12.891
Come on.

44:12.891 --> 44:13.720
Come on.

44:18.172 --> 44:19.829
Fuck.

44:20.796 --> 44:21.659
Oh, fuck.

44:23.177 --> 44:24.178
- You know this guy?

44:25.283 --> 44:26.111
- No.

44:27.216 --> 44:28.044
No, I don't.

44:29.356 --> 44:30.806
- There's no reason you would.

44:30.806 --> 44:32.946
- Hey, asshole, you
broke into my house,

44:32.946 --> 44:35.983
so technically, I got
it, I could kill you

44:35.983 --> 44:37.191
and I'd be within my rights,

44:37.191 --> 44:38.779
isn't that right, Officer Riley?

44:40.367 --> 44:41.195
- It feels right.

44:42.714 --> 44:44.198
- Sounds good to me.

44:44.198 --> 44:45.717
- Who are you?

44:45.717 --> 44:46.580
- Fuck off.

44:46.580 --> 44:47.823
- Fuck yourself.

44:47.823 --> 44:49.238
You're not a guest
here, who are you?

44:52.275 --> 44:53.863
- Shane.

44:53.863 --> 44:55.209
Dr. Emmet Shane.

44:56.624 --> 44:58.696
- How the fuck did you
get in my basement?

45:00.007 --> 45:02.838
- Your side door, your
side door was unlocked.

45:02.838 --> 45:03.770
- So what, you were just hiding?

45:03.770 --> 45:05.530
Hiding from what?

45:05.530 --> 45:06.980
What's out there?

45:06.980 --> 45:08.291
- Yes.

45:08.291 --> 45:09.292
- Where do you work?

45:10.328 --> 45:11.950
I said where do you work?

45:14.712 --> 45:16.575
- I work at Nexor Labs.

45:17.645 --> 45:19.233
- Are you responsible
for all this?

45:19.233 --> 45:21.615
- Me, personally?
- Okay.

45:21.615 --> 45:24.169
You snarky son of a bitch,
you think you can attack me.

45:24.169 --> 45:25.412
- No, wait, Nina, Nina.

45:25.412 --> 45:26.654
- I will fucking kill you.
- Nina.

45:26.654 --> 45:27.759
- I will kill you.
- Stop, Nina, stop.

45:27.759 --> 45:30.210
- This is not healthy.
- Nina, stop.

45:30.210 --> 45:32.074
Calm down.

45:32.074 --> 45:34.007
Okay?

45:34.007 --> 45:35.525
Calm down, it's gonna be okay.

45:40.427 --> 45:42.256
- That's what they
want to happen.

45:42.256 --> 45:44.155
They want us to tear
each other apart.

45:45.397 --> 45:46.226
- Who?

45:49.816 --> 45:50.851
Who, goddammit?

45:55.269 --> 45:58.652
- You want the official
statement or you want the truth?

46:02.725 --> 46:04.969
We've been toying around
with this for a while.

46:06.108 --> 46:08.558
Chemical warfare
can only go so far.

46:09.767 --> 46:11.285
Gas masks can protect you.

46:13.425 --> 46:15.842
But what if we could
have made a nerve agent

46:15.842 --> 46:17.878
that could be absorbed
through the skin

46:17.878 --> 46:21.261
or through the ears or
by some other means.

46:22.987 --> 46:24.989
That's what wins wars.

46:24.989 --> 46:26.714
Changes countries.

46:28.061 --> 46:29.303
That's what they gave us.

46:30.822 --> 46:31.754
They cut a single,

46:32.928 --> 46:34.757
so we sent a probe
up, in friendship.

46:36.379 --> 46:38.002
They sent back meteors.

46:39.693 --> 46:41.971
Impact was about 15 hours ago,

46:43.801 --> 46:45.181
and that's when it started.

46:47.632 --> 46:51.705
Starts with a tingle in
the base of the spine

46:51.705 --> 46:54.052
and it slowly moves up to
the center of your brain

46:54.052 --> 46:57.366
where all your hate
and aggression lie.

46:59.540 --> 47:00.818
It jump starts that.

47:01.819 --> 47:03.717
Removes all the inhibitors,

47:05.236 --> 47:09.516
and all that hate comes spilling
out in glorious fashion.

47:11.311 --> 47:14.555
It really is a thing
of destructive beauty.

47:17.765 --> 47:21.183
Before we knew it, there
were impacts in other cities.

47:21.183 --> 47:23.530
DC, Boston, New York.

47:24.980 --> 47:26.774
By the time it's all sorted out,

47:28.017 --> 47:29.708
all those cities will be gone,

47:31.607 --> 47:33.298
wiped out by man's
own aggression.

47:36.784 --> 47:39.580
Whatever it is up there,
they don't like us very much.

47:39.580 --> 47:40.581
This is it.

47:40.581 --> 47:43.895
An extinction level event.

47:44.862 --> 47:46.173
This is how the world ends.

47:49.797 --> 47:51.109
- What do we do?

47:59.600 --> 48:02.017
- You're looking at me,
why are you asking me?

48:02.017 --> 48:03.328
- What?

48:03.328 --> 48:04.882
Yes.

48:04.882 --> 48:06.642
I am asking you.

48:06.642 --> 48:09.334
I am fucking asking you

48:09.334 --> 48:11.509
because you have the answers.

48:11.509 --> 48:13.856
You have the solution.

48:13.856 --> 48:16.376
You can fix it, remember?

48:16.376 --> 48:21.001
You always fix it, so how
are we gonna fix it, Eric?

48:22.623 --> 48:24.522
- We go to the basement,
we barricade ourselves in,

48:24.522 --> 48:26.248
and we don't leave
until this is over.

48:26.248 --> 48:28.733
- Fucking wait it
out and then what?

48:28.733 --> 48:29.665
Then what are we gonna do?

48:29.665 --> 48:31.253
That shit's gonna seep in here

48:31.253 --> 48:32.702
and kill all of us, all of us.

48:32.702 --> 48:34.428
- So we try.

48:34.428 --> 48:36.258
- No, hey.
- We try this time.

48:36.258 --> 48:38.156
You don't get to
take this from me.

48:38.156 --> 48:39.778
- CJ, you need to calm down.

48:39.778 --> 48:42.781
You need to calm down, now.

48:46.509 --> 48:47.476
- Do you know what?

48:48.408 --> 48:49.271
Fuck you guys.

48:50.410 --> 48:53.965
- You know what, who
the fuck cares, anyways?

48:54.828 --> 48:56.485
Fuck.

48:56.485 --> 48:58.487
This is my house.

49:10.602 --> 49:13.088
- Okay, Danny, you and Monica,

49:13.088 --> 49:15.573
just go upstairs and make
sure the windows are closed,

49:15.573 --> 49:17.678
and make sure Eric
double checks the attic.

49:17.678 --> 49:18.956
- All right.
- I got you.

49:18.956 --> 49:20.060
- Let's go.
- Come on.

49:21.959 --> 49:23.684
- Sophie, come here,
it's okay, it's okay.

49:23.684 --> 49:24.754
It's gonna be okay.

49:24.754 --> 49:26.308
It's gonna be okay.

50:12.595 --> 50:13.424
- Danny.

50:14.632 --> 50:15.598
Danny.

50:15.598 --> 50:17.290
Danny.
- You okay?

50:17.290 --> 50:18.118
- Danny, I don't.

50:18.118 --> 50:19.292
Something's wrong.

50:19.292 --> 50:21.018
- Hey, look at me, look at me.

50:22.191 --> 50:23.572
Come on.

50:27.610 --> 50:30.406
- I can see downtown
from here, hold on.

50:32.270 --> 50:33.099
- What?

50:34.065 --> 50:35.825
- Do you see that?

50:35.825 --> 50:36.757
See what?

50:37.896 --> 50:40.244
- The glow.

50:41.659 --> 50:42.453
- Hang on.

50:48.252 --> 50:50.806
Here, look, look.

50:56.536 --> 51:01.472
Please don't tell me
that's what I think it is.

51:03.060 --> 51:04.406
- I think it's headed here.

51:08.927 --> 51:09.997
- What do we do?

51:45.240 --> 51:48.415
- I found this in Sophie
and Eric's cabinet.

51:53.455 --> 51:55.974
And I would hate to see
it get wasted in the move.

52:10.782 --> 52:12.059
It's good shit.

52:41.158 --> 52:42.366
- It was our first date.

52:48.061 --> 52:48.993
That's when I knew.

52:53.998 --> 52:57.588
It didn't take six
months or a year,

53:00.694 --> 53:01.799
I just knew right then.

53:09.289 --> 53:11.533
And we've hurt each
other a lot since then.

53:22.095 --> 53:25.823
And I know I'm not always the
easiest person to deal with.

53:32.726 --> 53:34.935
- You're fucking impossible.

53:38.007 --> 53:39.008
It's okay.

53:39.008 --> 53:39.837
- I know.

53:39.837 --> 53:40.700
- I'm not easy either.

53:42.598 --> 53:44.082
I really still give a shit.

53:44.082 --> 53:45.394
That's why I'm here.

53:45.394 --> 53:46.464
- I know.

53:46.464 --> 53:47.396
- That's why I'm here.
- I know.

53:47.396 --> 53:48.535
I'm sorry.

53:48.535 --> 53:49.847
I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

53:49.847 --> 53:50.951
I'm sorry, too.

53:50.951 --> 53:52.608
- I'm sorry.

53:54.921 --> 53:56.371
And I know I said do
whatever the fuck you want,

53:56.371 --> 53:58.235
but I don't mean that.

53:59.960 --> 54:01.997
You don't get to do whatever
the fuck you want this time.

54:04.965 --> 54:06.484
- I like it when
you're demanding.

54:13.595 --> 54:15.769
- I'm scared, CJ.

54:27.229 --> 54:28.299
- What is it?

54:36.342 --> 54:37.343
- Wait, wait.

54:38.689 --> 54:39.517
Don't move.

54:43.556 --> 54:45.765
- It's just a matter of
time before they make it in.

54:47.491 --> 54:50.701
- Either that or the gas is
gonna leak in through the vents.

54:50.701 --> 54:53.704
Eventually
it'll find a way to seep in.

54:53.704 --> 54:56.085
- Can we just go somewhere
and get more equipment?

54:56.085 --> 54:57.708
- Where the fuck
are we gonna go?

54:59.157 --> 55:01.815
- If you can move, can we
make a run for the cars?

55:01.815 --> 55:02.885
- And go where?

55:03.817 --> 55:05.302
- I don't know.

55:05.302 --> 55:07.787
- Try that radio thing again,
get the emergency line up.

55:07.787 --> 55:09.823
- Okay, okay, hold on.

55:14.138 --> 55:17.728
Echo seven, this is Riley
in an emergency frequency.

55:17.728 --> 55:18.936
Do you copy, over?

55:23.354 --> 55:24.838
Echo seven, this is Riley--

55:24.838 --> 55:27.703
Echo seven,
this is tango six one.

55:27.703 --> 55:29.222
It's getting worse out here.

55:29.222 --> 55:31.362
We just got word DC and
Philly have both been hit.

55:31.362 --> 55:33.330
It already started there.

55:33.330 --> 55:35.055
Now, New York's gonna
fall within the hour.

55:35.055 --> 55:35.987
This is it.

55:35.987 --> 55:37.437
The winds are shifting down.

55:37.437 --> 55:39.474
It's pushing all this
shit over the top of you.

55:39.474 --> 55:40.337
Copy?

55:41.821 --> 55:43.685
Riley, are you safe?

55:45.238 --> 55:46.239
- Copy that.

55:47.447 --> 55:48.552
We're running short on time here

55:48.552 --> 55:50.554
and we have no supplies.

55:53.419 --> 55:55.041
We have seven survivors with us.

55:56.456 --> 55:59.597
Is there any way out, over?

55:59.597 --> 56:01.081
I know, I know
there's a police substation

56:01.081 --> 56:03.049
just off of Center Avenue.

56:03.049 --> 56:03.981
If you can make it there,

56:03.981 --> 56:05.465
there should be more supplies.

56:05.465 --> 56:07.087
I can't guarantee that,

56:07.087 --> 56:09.366
but it might be
your best option.

56:09.366 --> 56:10.367
If you stay where you are,
you are sitting ducks.

56:10.367 --> 56:12.369
I repeat, you are fucked.

56:14.129 --> 56:17.719
- We're starting to
get that feeling, over.

56:19.376 --> 56:22.586
Where's Center Ave from here?

56:22.586 --> 56:25.382
- It's about three
miles that way,

56:25.382 --> 56:27.487
but we'd have to go through town

56:27.487 --> 56:31.388
and we only have one mask.

56:31.388 --> 56:32.872
- Then only one of us can go.

56:34.287 --> 56:37.014
- That means one of us is
gonna have to get to the car,

56:37.014 --> 56:41.501
get in, supply
up, get back here,

56:41.501 --> 56:44.401
and then we get
clear of the city.

56:47.369 --> 56:51.442
- Harrigan, we're going
for that substation,

56:51.442 --> 56:53.202
and then we're coming for you.

56:54.721 --> 56:56.447
Once we get back
with the supplies,

56:57.655 --> 57:00.106
I'll radio you and
get your location.

57:01.487 --> 57:02.453
Echo seven out.

57:04.213 --> 57:06.353
Copy that,
watch your ass, Riley.

57:07.527 --> 57:09.287
- I never liked
Philly much anyway.

57:13.671 --> 57:15.155
- Okay, all right.

57:15.155 --> 57:16.847
We gotta figure out
what we're doing next.

57:16.847 --> 57:17.779
What's the plan?

57:17.779 --> 57:19.056
- Okay, just wait a second.

57:21.438 --> 57:23.060
What exactly are
we dealing with?

57:24.268 --> 57:27.167
The minute this touches
our skin do we--

57:27.167 --> 57:30.895
- It slowly absorbs through
the pores of the skin.

57:30.895 --> 57:32.276
- Okay, so we just,
we have to cover up,

57:32.276 --> 57:33.967
we have to get barriers.

57:33.967 --> 57:36.729
- Sophie, do you have any extra
clothes that aren't packed?

57:36.729 --> 57:37.661
Like gloves?

57:37.661 --> 57:38.938
- Most of it's in the van,

57:38.938 --> 57:41.458
but you know what, I saw
some things downstairs.

57:41.458 --> 57:42.804
- Okay.
- I'll go check--

57:42.804 --> 57:44.322
- Yeah, go check.
- And see if I can find them.

57:44.322 --> 57:45.703
All right?
- Yeah.

57:49.120 --> 57:50.708
So who goes?

57:52.227 --> 57:53.470
- I'll go.

57:53.470 --> 57:54.747
- What, Danny, no.

57:54.747 --> 57:57.094
- No, I'm the fastest
in this group anyways.

57:57.094 --> 57:59.096
Fuck you trying to say?

57:59.096 --> 58:01.201
- I think I said it all, man.

58:01.201 --> 58:03.928
All right, fuck you.

58:03.928 --> 58:05.827
- Here, you're gonna need it.

58:12.281 --> 58:14.214
- Hey, guys, come here.

58:14.214 --> 58:17.873
Did you
find anything, Soph?

58:17.873 --> 58:19.461
- Yeah, a few things.

58:19.461 --> 58:21.808
Here can you grab
those, thank you.

58:21.808 --> 58:23.983
All right, found some jackets.

58:23.983 --> 58:25.502
It's pretty much
what's down there.

58:25.502 --> 58:28.159
If you need me to
keep looking, I can.

58:28.159 --> 58:29.885
- This'll work, this is perfect.

58:29.885 --> 58:31.438
- All right, awesome.

58:31.438 --> 58:32.923
Has anyone seen Eric?

58:32.923 --> 58:35.201
His tool kit's over there
but I haven't seen him.

58:35.201 --> 58:36.996
He must have finished
covering up the vents, right?

58:36.996 --> 58:39.205
- Last I saw him, he
was up in the attic.

58:39.205 --> 58:41.000
- All right, I'm gonna go
check on him, then, okay?

58:41.000 --> 58:42.864
- Okay, I'll go with you.
- No.

58:42.864 --> 58:44.348
I got this.

58:44.348 --> 58:45.763
I think he's probably just
pissed off, all right.

58:45.763 --> 58:47.006
- Okay.
- I got this.

58:49.456 --> 58:52.149
Sorry 'bout that, guys.

59:05.956 --> 59:06.784
Wait.

59:07.785 --> 59:09.166
What's that?

59:18.693 --> 59:20.246
- Doesn't sound
like a helicopter.

59:21.419 --> 59:22.559
- Whatever it is, it
sounds pretty low.

59:22.559 --> 59:24.837
Can you see anything?

59:24.837 --> 59:25.700
- That's a lot of people.

59:27.322 --> 59:28.841
- They must be
drawn to the sound.

59:31.222 --> 59:32.258
- Dan, are you ready?

59:33.397 --> 59:34.743
- Yeah, I'm ready.

59:40.611 --> 59:41.578
- Sophie.
- Sophie?

59:41.578 --> 59:42.440
- Guys.

59:46.997 --> 59:48.792
- Be careful.

01:00:23.481 --> 01:00:25.380
- Shut the fuck up, guys.

01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:29.487
She's finally quiet.

01:00:29.487 --> 01:00:33.422
Fucking crying with the
baby, the fucking baby.

01:00:34.941 --> 01:00:37.219
Crying, I couldn't take it.

01:00:38.151 --> 01:00:40.050
What the fuck is this?

01:00:40.050 --> 01:00:44.226
I can't--

01:01:12.116 --> 01:01:14.153
- What happened?
- Sophie's dead.

01:01:14.153 --> 01:01:15.154
What?

01:01:15.154 --> 01:01:16.638
- There's no time.

01:01:16.638 --> 01:01:17.777
Eric didn't close the
vents, it's in the house.

01:01:17.777 --> 01:01:18.916
It's in the house.
- Oh my god.

01:01:18.916 --> 01:01:19.606
- It's in the house.
- Oh my god.

01:01:19.606 --> 01:01:21.539
We have to go.

01:01:29.375 --> 01:01:31.135
- Don't fucking move.

01:01:40.213 --> 01:01:41.490
- What is that?

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.702
What is my head on fire?

01:01:57.058 --> 01:01:58.231
- Go.

01:02:23.532 --> 01:02:25.465
What are we
supposed to do now?

01:02:25.465 --> 01:02:26.708
What do we do?

01:02:26.708 --> 01:02:28.296
- We stay alive
as long as we can,

01:02:28.296 --> 01:02:29.297
and make for the police station.

01:02:29.297 --> 01:02:30.229
- How?

01:02:30.229 --> 01:02:31.023
We only have one mask.

01:02:31.023 --> 01:02:31.782
- Then we rotate.

01:02:34.302 --> 01:02:35.130
Fuck.

01:02:37.961 --> 01:02:40.032
- They're coming in.

01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:44.657
- No, no, they aren't.

01:02:46.279 --> 01:02:48.074
I'm buying you guys time.
- Danny, no.

01:02:48.074 --> 01:02:49.248
- You need to go.

01:02:49.248 --> 01:02:51.008
All right, get
covered and get out.

01:02:51.008 --> 01:02:52.665
- Danny.

01:02:52.665 --> 01:02:54.736
- I said go before
it's too late.

01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:06.610
- Okay, I know Sophie looked.

01:03:08.854 --> 01:03:10.476
We were here earlier.

01:03:13.651 --> 01:03:14.756
Here.

01:03:14.756 --> 01:03:17.241
Jackets, CJ, here, put 'em on.

01:03:18.208 --> 01:03:19.416
Put 'em on.

01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:23.489
We'll just wear these
sweaters now, okay?

01:03:23.489 --> 01:03:25.767
We can wrap 'em around
you and I'll wear them,

01:03:25.767 --> 01:03:27.010
and we'll be okay.

01:03:27.010 --> 01:03:28.805
No, CJ.
- It's not working.

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:29.667
- CJ.

01:03:31.428 --> 01:03:33.810
CJ, please, just put them on.

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:37.779
CJ, please, don't make
me do this by myself.

01:03:37.779 --> 01:03:39.022
Okay, please?

01:03:40.747 --> 01:03:43.681
CJ, CJ, CJ, I can't
do this by myself.

01:03:43.681 --> 01:03:46.961
Okay, so please put these on.

01:03:46.961 --> 01:03:49.135
Okay, look at me, CJ?

01:03:50.102 --> 01:03:52.311
Okay.

01:03:52.311 --> 01:03:54.244
I don't wanna do this alone.

01:03:56.522 --> 01:03:58.731
So just put 'em on and
we're gonna be okay.

01:03:58.731 --> 01:04:00.733
- So tired.
- Okay?

01:04:00.733 --> 01:04:02.079
I know.

01:04:02.079 --> 01:04:03.011
I know, I know, but
it's gonna be okay.

01:04:03.011 --> 01:04:04.323
You're gonna put these on,

01:04:04.323 --> 01:04:07.395
and I'm gonna wear them
and it's gonna be okay.

01:04:08.534 --> 01:04:09.880
Okay?

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:10.743
Okay?

01:04:34.836 --> 01:04:35.733
- Let's go.

01:04:37.528 --> 01:04:39.185
Let's go, it's time.

01:05:22.297 --> 01:05:23.781
- There's plenty of
layers downstairs.

01:05:23.781 --> 01:05:26.370
I'm gonna grab some, we can
put some jackets on you.

01:05:26.370 --> 01:05:27.751
- I want you to put this on.

01:05:27.751 --> 01:05:28.890
- Stop, CJ, we have
so many layers.

01:05:28.890 --> 01:05:30.133
- I need you to put this on.

01:05:30.133 --> 01:05:31.168
- CJ, stop.
- I need you to put this on.

01:05:31.168 --> 01:05:32.756
- You can put some layers on.

01:05:32.756 --> 01:05:33.964
I don't--
- Nina.

01:05:33.964 --> 01:05:35.138
- I'm not going by myself.
- Nina.

01:05:35.138 --> 01:05:37.036
- CJ, I don't
wanna go by myself.

01:05:37.036 --> 01:05:38.037
- Nina.
- We can--

01:05:38.037 --> 01:05:39.245
- I need you to listen.

01:05:39.245 --> 01:05:40.039
- Find a way for
you to come with me.

01:05:40.039 --> 01:05:41.040
- No.
- Yes.

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.455
- There isn't another way.

01:05:42.455 --> 01:05:43.284
- You can--

01:05:43.284 --> 01:05:44.112
- There is no other way.

01:05:47.667 --> 01:05:49.946
If you go alone,
you have a chance.

01:05:49.946 --> 01:05:52.500
If you go alone,
you have a chance.

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:56.055
You're gonna have
to and you can.

01:05:58.161 --> 01:05:58.989
You can.

01:06:03.304 --> 01:06:04.270
I know you can.

01:06:08.274 --> 01:06:09.655
I love you.

01:06:09.655 --> 01:06:12.244
- You too.
- I love you so much.

01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:16.627
- Okay.

01:06:20.148 --> 01:06:20.977
- Go.

01:06:47.451 --> 01:06:48.694
Okay, yes.

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:52.111
Okay, yes.

01:07:00.361 --> 01:07:02.156
Thank you so much.

01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:06.988
Hello.

01:09:06.763 --> 01:09:08.591
- Please someone copy.

01:09:11.939 --> 01:09:12.941
Please.

01:09:12.941 --> 01:09:14.184
I'm a survivor.

01:09:16.290 --> 01:09:18.982
I'm going to the police station.

01:09:20.259 --> 01:09:21.502
Please.

01:09:21.502 --> 01:09:22.330
Anyone.

01:09:24.194 --> 01:09:25.850
Fuck.

01:09:27.301 --> 01:09:28.371
Fire and
police, this is rescue three.

01:09:28.371 --> 01:09:30.304
Repeat, this is rescue three.

01:09:30.304 --> 01:09:32.064
Are you affected by the toxin?

01:09:32.064 --> 01:09:32.892
- No.

01:09:34.515 --> 01:09:35.792
No.

01:09:35.792 --> 01:09:39.036
Are you alone?

01:09:39.036 --> 01:09:40.140
- Yes.

01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:40.969
Yes.

01:09:42.281 --> 01:09:45.283
Yes.

01:09:45.283 --> 01:09:49.357
Please, somebody come
and get me, please.

01:09:49.357 --> 01:09:51.911
Where are you?

01:09:51.911 --> 01:09:55.812
- I'm at the plain police
station, please, somebody.

01:09:57.193 --> 01:09:58.090
Just
sit tight, ma'am.

01:09:58.090 --> 01:09:59.954
The first wave has past.

01:09:59.954 --> 01:10:01.127
Have you seen them yet?

01:10:02.681 --> 01:10:04.269
Have you seen them yet?

01:10:05.684 --> 01:10:06.995
- No.

01:10:06.995 --> 01:10:08.238
What's your name?

01:10:09.135 --> 01:10:10.482
- Nina.

01:10:10.482 --> 01:10:12.380
My name is Nina.

01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:14.210
Nina,
we're on our way, sit tight.

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:15.625
We are coming to get you.

01:10:15.625 --> 01:10:19.732
Just for 15, 20 minutes,
the rescue is coming.

01:12:48.605 --> 01:12:49.434
Stop.

01:12:52.126 --> 01:12:52.954
Okay.

01:14:38.232 --> 01:14:39.475
- Nina.

01:14:44.134 --> 01:14:45.308
Where are you?

01:14:46.447 --> 01:14:48.553
Always running away,
fucking runaway.

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:52.315
Only think you're good at.

01:14:54.006 --> 01:14:55.870
You're not fucking
good at keeping a man.

01:15:04.879 --> 01:15:05.708
Fuck.

01:15:06.743 --> 01:15:07.882
Fuck.

01:15:07.882 --> 01:15:09.505
Nina, I wanna go home.

01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:13.785
I'm fucking burning up, I
just wanna fucking go home.

01:15:13.785 --> 01:15:15.511
I just wanna go home.

01:15:15.511 --> 01:15:17.098
I can't go home.

01:15:17.098 --> 01:15:17.892
I can't go home.

01:15:22.069 --> 01:15:24.520
Until I killed my mother
fucking runaway, where are you?

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:25.382
Nina.

01:15:28.351 --> 01:15:29.835
Nina.

01:15:29.835 --> 01:15:32.079
You know what I really
fucking hated towards the end?

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:36.601
The nasty little fucking
pussy between your legs.

01:15:36.601 --> 01:15:38.775
Why would I fucking
come home to that,

01:15:38.775 --> 01:15:40.432
disgusting fucking bullshit,

01:15:40.432 --> 01:15:42.607
why would I put a
fucking baby in that?

01:15:43.746 --> 01:15:45.333
Why would I fucking
give you a baby

01:15:45.333 --> 01:15:47.335
so I could rip it out of
your nasty fucking pussy.

01:15:47.335 --> 01:15:50.338
Oh my god, you stupid
little fucking cunt.

01:15:50.338 --> 01:15:52.237
Maybe I should have fucked her.

01:15:52.237 --> 01:15:54.515
Maybe I should have fucked
her, you ugly fucking saggy

01:15:54.515 --> 01:15:56.448
tit piece of shit.

01:15:58.554 --> 01:15:59.382
No.

01:16:16.192 --> 01:16:17.227
I'm gonna kill you.

01:16:18.712 --> 01:16:20.127
I never fucking loved you.

01:16:21.922 --> 01:16:25.960
And killing you is gonna feel
almost as good as fucking her.

01:16:27.341 --> 01:16:32.346
