00:01.566 --> 00:03.655
Previously onSalvation...

00:03.699 --> 00:06.745
My sister's body is in a morgue.
Someone killed her.

00:06.789 --> 00:08.834
If we tell Mackenzie and Darius,
and they don't take action...

00:08.878 --> 00:10.619
They're complicit in a cover-up.

00:10.662 --> 00:12.142
I'm trying to protect you.

00:12.186 --> 00:14.144
Why can't you
just leave it alone?

00:14.188 --> 00:16.973
Because you're
tortured by something.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.062
Well, this used
to be her night-light.

00:19.106 --> 00:23.023
What the hell?

00:23.066 --> 00:25.460
JILLIAN: Accept what is?
That's a Zen approach.

00:25.503 --> 00:27.027
It's a COPE approach, actually.

00:27.070 --> 00:28.071
The guy who wrote
all those books?

00:28.115 --> 00:29.333
Bass Shepherd, yeah.

00:29.377 --> 00:30.813
BENNETT:
My removal from office

00:30.856 --> 00:33.076
was criminal!

00:33.120 --> 00:34.947
Chief Justice Cheng remains
in critical condition.

00:34.991 --> 00:36.862
Cheng's vote
is the deciding factor

00:36.906 --> 00:38.473
as to who is the rightful
president of the United States.

00:38.516 --> 00:39.604
MAN:
We are with Monroe Bennett,

00:39.648 --> 00:40.779
the legitimate president
of the United...

00:40.823 --> 00:43.521
ALONZO: Mackenzie's
the legal president.

00:43.565 --> 00:45.915
Yeah. How do I know
I can trust you?

00:45.958 --> 00:47.699
You don't, but, frankly,
I'm all you got.

00:47.743 --> 00:49.223
The White House is compromised.

00:49.266 --> 00:51.268
I will not abandon this post.
Get ready, men.

00:51.312 --> 00:53.531
SOLDIER:
Shamrock, this is Command.
We've taken the White House.

00:53.575 --> 00:56.752
This is President Monroe
Bennett. The fighting is over.

00:56.795 --> 00:58.319
What the hell's going on?DARIUS:
Justice Cheng's video

00:58.362 --> 01:00.190
has just hit the airwaves.
Truth is out. You're a criminal.

01:00.234 --> 01:02.584
You think this is over?
This is just the beginning.

01:02.627 --> 01:03.541
The beginning of what?

01:23.257 --> 01:25.128
MAN:
Go right this way.

01:39.055 --> 01:42.624
I was unsure if we'd be ready
to test, but here we are.

01:42.667 --> 01:44.321
It's amazing what people
can accomplish

01:44.365 --> 01:46.062
when there's an asteroid
hurtling toward them.

01:46.106 --> 01:49.674
Behold the savior
of the human race.

01:49.718 --> 01:51.894
JILLIAN:
This is the rail gun.

01:51.937 --> 01:54.244
It looks like
a fancy sewer pipe.

01:54.288 --> 01:55.724
That sewer pipe

01:55.767 --> 01:59.119
will propel one-ton slugs
of depleted uranium

01:59.162 --> 02:00.511
moving 30 times the speed
of sound into the asteroid.

02:00.555 --> 02:02.078
It'll pass
through the atmosphere

02:02.122 --> 02:03.949
in three or four seconds.
You'll never see it.

02:03.993 --> 02:05.995
STENDAHL: But you'll hear it
and you'll feel it.

02:06.038 --> 02:07.997
We'll have to evacuate
the nearby towns.

02:08.040 --> 02:09.999
Details for later.
First, let's see if she works.

02:10.042 --> 02:11.740
Rosetta, initiate the test.

02:11.783 --> 02:14.003
All systems check.

02:14.046 --> 02:15.613
Power up the electromagnets.

02:15.657 --> 02:17.789
FEMALE VOICE:
Initiating test.

02:20.096 --> 02:22.054
Is that normal?

02:22.098 --> 02:23.839
The electromagnets need
to be strong enough

02:23.882 --> 02:25.449
to propel the projectiles
out of the atmosphere.

02:25.493 --> 02:26.755
We're using enough electricity

02:26.798 --> 02:29.018
to power a major city.

02:29.061 --> 02:30.541
Take us to full power.

02:38.506 --> 02:40.334
That's not normal.

02:41.726 --> 02:43.815
Warning.
Structural failure in 12...

02:43.859 --> 02:45.643
Shut her down!

02:45.687 --> 02:47.993
...ten, nine, eight,

02:48.037 --> 02:50.692
seven, six,

02:50.735 --> 02:53.216
five, four,

02:53.260 --> 02:54.870
three, two...

02:54.913 --> 02:56.611
Test aborted.

03:00.702 --> 03:01.659
DARIUS:
The engineers didn't account

03:01.703 --> 03:03.531
for the soil composition.

03:03.574 --> 03:05.010
There's a high concentration
of ferrous metals.

03:05.054 --> 03:06.534
What does that mean?

03:06.577 --> 03:08.188
The pull of the
electromagnets increased

03:08.231 --> 03:10.364
the compression forces,
causing the tunnels to buckle.

03:10.407 --> 03:12.627
We need to reinforce it
with nonmagnetic,

03:12.670 --> 03:14.368
high compressive
strength plastic.

03:14.411 --> 03:16.196
That's gonna set us back.

03:16.239 --> 03:17.762
Who are we gonna get
to do the design specs

03:17.806 --> 03:19.416
on such short notice?Leave that to me.

03:19.460 --> 03:20.722
In the meantime,
I need you to requisition

03:20.765 --> 03:22.419
as much of that plastic
as you can find.

03:22.463 --> 03:24.334
I need the rail gun
up and running in two weeks.

03:24.378 --> 03:25.901
Two weeks?

03:25.944 --> 03:27.903
Th-Tha-That's almost impossible.

03:27.946 --> 03:30.427
Almost impossible,
which means it's possible.

03:30.471 --> 03:34.039
Darius. That asteroid is
going to hit us in 86 days.

03:34.083 --> 03:35.954
This has a thousand
moving parts to it.

03:35.998 --> 03:38.130
We need your attention,
full time.

03:39.523 --> 03:41.873
And you'll have it. I promise.

03:54.321 --> 03:57.585
ALYCIA:
Hey.

03:57.628 --> 04:00.762
I enjoyed our night.

04:00.805 --> 04:02.546
Me, too.

04:05.680 --> 04:08.335
So...
Mm.

04:08.378 --> 04:09.640
I have some good news.

04:09.684 --> 04:13.818
Your efforts have not
gone unnoticed here.

04:13.862 --> 04:16.256
Unnoticed by who?Nero.

04:16.299 --> 04:17.953
The grand master
of all things RE/SYST?

04:17.996 --> 04:22.218
We're ready to accept you
into our ranks, Liam.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.481
Accept me into RE/SYST?

04:24.525 --> 04:27.745
You deserve a say
in things going forward.

04:27.789 --> 04:29.791
Does this mean I have to, like,

04:29.834 --> 04:31.488
take part in a blood oath
and vow to uphold the omertà?

04:31.532 --> 04:33.316
:
No.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.884
But you do have to vow
to uphold our principles.

04:35.927 --> 04:37.320
Sic semper tyrannis.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.148
Sic semper tyrannis.

04:39.191 --> 04:40.454
"Thus always,

04:40.497 --> 04:42.847
I bring death to tyrants."

04:42.891 --> 04:44.109
I can get behind that.

04:44.153 --> 04:46.721
Good.

04:46.764 --> 04:49.289
Now, you need a handle.

04:49.332 --> 04:51.465
A nom de guerre.

04:51.508 --> 04:53.902
What's yours?

04:53.945 --> 04:56.121
Uh-uh. I don't kiss and tell.

04:56.165 --> 04:57.601
Come on.

04:57.645 --> 04:59.342
No.After all we've been through,

04:59.386 --> 05:00.300
you don't trust me?

05:04.216 --> 05:05.870
Okay.

05:08.264 --> 05:09.744
I'm LadyHawk.

05:09.787 --> 05:11.572
You're LadyHawk?

05:11.615 --> 05:14.618
For real? Like, you hacked
the European Central Bank.

05:14.662 --> 05:16.228
I thought I was Robin Hood.
It was reckless.

05:16.272 --> 05:19.667
But let's just say that
a few million Europeans

05:19.710 --> 05:21.277
did have a very merry
Christmas that year.

05:22.713 --> 05:24.976
Your turn.

05:25.020 --> 05:28.850
Uh, all right, well,
in keeping with the theme

05:28.893 --> 05:31.592
of rebel scientists...

05:32.636 --> 05:34.029
I like it.

05:34.072 --> 05:36.031
Galileo,

05:36.074 --> 05:37.162
welcome to RE/SYST.

05:37.206 --> 05:39.295
Thank you.

05:40.862 --> 05:42.037
CROFT:
Liam!

05:43.473 --> 05:45.214
Croft, what the hell?

05:45.257 --> 05:47.085
Well, lock your door next time.
Slumber party's over.

05:47.129 --> 05:48.783
Get dressed. We got
a big problem. Let's go.

05:55.790 --> 05:58.096
HUGH:
Spinach, avocado, tomato.
Just the way you like it.

05:58.140 --> 06:00.838
Dad. You don't have
to baby me, I'm fine.

06:00.882 --> 06:02.971
Hey. You almost
got killed, Gracie.

06:03.014 --> 06:05.234
It's okay not to be fine.

06:05.277 --> 06:06.757
Now stop your whining

06:06.801 --> 06:08.324
and let your old man
make you a damn omelet.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.021
Remind me to get you

06:10.065 --> 06:12.284
a World's Best Dad mug
for Father's Day.

06:22.817 --> 06:24.775
May I help you?

06:24.819 --> 06:26.211
I'm looking for Grace?

06:26.255 --> 06:27.212
GRACE:
Alonzo?
Hey.

06:27.256 --> 06:29.780
Hi.

06:29.824 --> 06:31.782
Uh, come on in.

06:31.826 --> 06:33.436
Thanks.

06:35.482 --> 06:37.962
Dad, this is
Detective Alonzo Carter.

06:38.006 --> 06:39.921
The fella who saved your life.

06:39.964 --> 06:42.445
Hugh Keating,
her grateful father.

06:42.489 --> 06:43.794
I'm the one who's grateful.

06:43.838 --> 06:45.013
Your daughter pulled
some strings

06:45.056 --> 06:46.797
and got me a copy
of my sister's autopsy.

06:46.841 --> 06:49.191
Sister?

06:49.234 --> 06:51.367
Claire Rayburn.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.761
Um...

06:53.804 --> 06:56.111
sorry for your loss.

06:56.154 --> 06:57.591
Yeah.

06:59.462 --> 07:01.246
Is this a bad time?No.

07:01.290 --> 07:03.031
No?No. My dad was actually
just heading out.

07:03.074 --> 07:04.336
Hmm.

07:04.380 --> 07:06.469
What are you doing here?

07:10.560 --> 07:12.475
Where did you get this?

07:12.519 --> 07:14.172
I found it
in my sister's snow globe.

07:14.216 --> 07:15.478
From that box
of stuff you gave me.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.088
What is it?

07:17.132 --> 07:19.047
Some kind of
encryption key.

07:19.090 --> 07:21.049
Sort of thing used
by hackers, arms dealers,

07:21.092 --> 07:22.833
people with something to hide.

07:22.877 --> 07:25.488
This one's for a bitcoin wallet.

07:25.532 --> 07:26.620
Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency.

07:26.663 --> 07:28.143
Uh-huh.

07:28.186 --> 07:30.145
You need to enter
a password to unlock it.

07:30.188 --> 07:32.147
Exactly 14 characters.

07:32.190 --> 07:34.497
But if you guess wrong, it
starts this damn clock running.

07:34.541 --> 07:35.977
First time I tried,
the clock said

07:36.020 --> 07:37.674
one minute
before I could try again.

07:37.718 --> 07:40.895
Next time, two
minutes, then four.

07:40.938 --> 07:43.201
It doubles each time
you guess wrong.

07:43.245 --> 07:45.203
30 attempts would take
a thousand years.

07:45.247 --> 07:47.902
And-and my guy, who is pretty
damn good, hit a dead end.

07:47.945 --> 07:49.991
But lucky for me,

07:50.034 --> 07:52.820
I have friends with connections.

07:52.863 --> 07:54.604
You want me to help you
crack this?

07:54.648 --> 07:56.345
You've got
the juice:

07:56.388 --> 07:57.912
NSA, CIA, DoD.

07:57.955 --> 07:59.914
Alonzo, I-I can't.

07:59.957 --> 08:01.437
Grace.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.960
I believe you.

08:03.004 --> 08:05.267
My sister went
to the dark side.

08:05.310 --> 08:07.269
Got caught up in
something big and bad,

08:07.312 --> 08:10.228
and the answers are in
this little piece of tech.

08:12.274 --> 08:13.841
Please.

08:13.884 --> 08:16.147
Help me.

08:25.635 --> 08:27.376
Right, no problem.

08:27.419 --> 08:29.465
Well, of course.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.467
And...

08:31.511 --> 08:33.425
Yeah, and, uh...

08:35.036 --> 08:37.734
I'll call you back.

08:37.778 --> 08:39.519
You can't
be serious.I've never formally resigned

08:39.562 --> 08:41.825
from anything before,
so there you have it.

08:41.869 --> 08:44.045
Proper penmanship and all.Darius.

08:44.088 --> 08:45.612
We have just reclaimed
the White House.

08:45.655 --> 08:47.265
This isn't the time.

08:47.309 --> 08:49.050
Now is exactly the time.

08:49.093 --> 08:51.139
Madam President,
Monroe Bennett is in custody.

08:51.182 --> 08:52.444
The streets are quiet.

08:52.488 --> 08:54.272
For now.

08:54.316 --> 08:56.666
Darius, this nation
has just stepped back

08:56.710 --> 08:58.494
from the brink of a civil war.

08:58.538 --> 09:01.236
We've been through
a great ordeal.

09:01.279 --> 09:04.587
The people
need stability.

09:04.631 --> 09:07.372
The rail gun.
We're falling behind.

09:07.416 --> 09:08.417
How far behind?

09:08.460 --> 09:09.592
Too far.

09:09.636 --> 09:12.073
Pauline,

09:12.116 --> 09:14.292
we promised the people
that I would come up

09:14.336 --> 09:16.251
with a plan to save them,
which I have.

09:16.294 --> 09:18.340
But I can't execute the plan
when I'm running on fumes.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.170
You're right.

09:25.042 --> 09:28.655
Have Grace put together
a list of suitable replacements.

09:28.698 --> 09:31.440
I'll make that my priority.And, Darius,

09:31.483 --> 09:33.616
let's keep this under wraps
till after the Unity Rally.

09:33.660 --> 09:38.795
It is critical that we project
a stable and unified front.

09:38.839 --> 09:39.970
Of course.

09:49.458 --> 09:51.765
So you know how that factory in
Taiwan was supposed to send us

09:51.808 --> 09:53.636
a few acres of beryllium
composite fabric?

09:53.680 --> 09:55.420
Yeah.Well, they didn't.

09:55.464 --> 09:57.771
So I asked a few of
these RE/SYST goons

09:57.814 --> 09:59.381
to check on their progress,

09:59.424 --> 10:01.644
and they found the factory
completely abandoned.

10:01.688 --> 10:04.429
Long story short, we have half
the material that we asked for.

10:04.473 --> 10:06.780
Half?
Yeah.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.216
ALYCIA:
Okay, if-if

10:08.259 --> 10:09.565
we reconfigure
the solar sail dimensions,

10:09.609 --> 10:11.045
strengthen the laser...

10:11.088 --> 10:13.482
No, even then,
we can't generate enough pull

10:13.525 --> 10:14.962
to move the asteroid off course.

10:15.005 --> 10:17.486
We are...Completely screwed.

10:17.529 --> 10:19.531
ALYCIA: So we either launch
a solar sail that's too small,

10:19.575 --> 10:22.622
or wait to build a bigger sail
that'll launch too late.

10:22.665 --> 10:25.102
Unless...

10:25.146 --> 10:27.670
Unless what?

10:27.714 --> 10:30.499
What if there wasa way to give
the asteroid the push it needs?

10:30.542 --> 10:31.761
Something that could
work in combination

10:31.805 --> 10:33.023
with a smaller solar sail?

10:33.067 --> 10:34.851
Like what?

10:38.072 --> 10:40.074
A rail gun.

10:40.117 --> 10:42.685
HARRIS:
You are playing with fire here.

10:42.729 --> 10:44.861
Why the hell would you give him
Claire's autopsy file?

10:44.905 --> 10:46.515
Do you have
some sort of death wish?

10:46.558 --> 10:47.864
The man saved my life, Harris.

10:47.908 --> 10:49.126
I had to give him something.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.824
And he gave you this?

10:50.867 --> 10:52.434
Cryptocurrency wallet.

10:52.477 --> 10:54.218
GRACE: Yes. Bennett
was looking for this,

10:54.262 --> 10:55.567
so clearly there's
something on here

10:55.611 --> 10:57.482
that was pretty
damn valuable to him.

10:57.526 --> 10:59.876
And Alonzo wants us
to help him decrypt it.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.096
He's trying to find
Claire's killer, Grace.

11:02.139 --> 11:04.533
Helping him is-is
dangerous territory.

11:04.576 --> 11:06.666
This is the danger, Harris.

11:09.277 --> 11:11.801
It's the same insignia as
the chip in Joe Riggs's neck.

11:11.845 --> 11:15.805
Darius was right about
the Ark. It was sabotage.

11:15.849 --> 11:17.720
And whoever was responsible
is connected to Bennett

11:17.764 --> 11:20.288
and Claire and Joe.

11:20.331 --> 11:23.944
This has layers beyond anything
we could have imagined.

11:23.987 --> 11:26.773
Bennett said this wasn't over.
It was just the beginning.

11:26.816 --> 11:28.557
GRACE:
People were getting paid

11:28.600 --> 11:31.255
to do terrible things,
and we need to figure out

11:31.299 --> 11:33.910
by whom and how
before it's too late.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.917
♪

11:53.887 --> 11:54.931
HARRIS:
"This is just the beginning."

11:54.975 --> 11:57.804
That's what you said.

11:57.847 --> 12:00.197
You care to explain?

12:00.241 --> 12:01.590
I have the right to an attorney.

12:03.374 --> 12:04.854
Or does the Constitution
mean nothing these days?

12:04.898 --> 12:06.682
You don't get
to invoke the Constitution,

12:06.726 --> 12:08.075
not after you dragged it
through the sewer.

12:11.382 --> 12:13.863
We found this in
Claire's belongings.

12:13.907 --> 12:17.301
It's the encryption key
for a bitcoin wallet.

12:17.345 --> 12:19.739
We need to know
how to access it.

12:19.782 --> 12:20.957
Claire Rayburn--
you mean the woman

12:21.001 --> 12:22.002
that you and your people
murdered?

12:23.133 --> 12:23.873
Son of a bitch.

12:25.527 --> 12:28.051
You murdered my son.

12:28.095 --> 12:30.227
That strike on RE/SYST.

12:30.271 --> 12:32.621
You knew he was in that
warehouse, didn't you?!

12:32.664 --> 12:34.318
You were just
testing my loyalty.

12:34.362 --> 12:35.798
And you passed.

12:35.842 --> 12:37.539
You're as ruthless
as I thought.

12:37.582 --> 12:39.149
Killing Claire
and covering it up.

12:39.193 --> 12:41.456
Look me in the eye
and tell me I'm wrong.

12:44.241 --> 12:47.114
We didn't kill anyone.

12:47.157 --> 12:50.073
Claire's death is on you and
whoever's pulling your strings.

12:50.117 --> 12:52.641
You don't want to cooperate,

12:52.684 --> 12:54.469
help us with the
password here? Fine.

12:54.512 --> 12:56.819
I guess you'd rather rot
in Guantanamo.

12:56.863 --> 12:58.821
Not until I have
a deal in place.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.170
Immunity.

13:02.259 --> 13:03.870
Protection for me and my family.

13:03.913 --> 13:05.175
Yeah, sure. Why don't you ask
for your pension, too,

13:05.219 --> 13:07.308
while you're at it?

13:07.351 --> 13:09.353
You're a traitor and
a murderer, Bennett.

13:09.397 --> 13:13.227
The best you can hope for is
leniency, and you know what?

13:13.270 --> 13:15.185
I'm not feeling very
generous right now.

13:15.229 --> 13:18.145
My deal, my terms.

13:20.234 --> 13:21.844
Or you're on your own.

13:24.978 --> 13:28.677
They're building
a rail gun?

13:28.720 --> 13:30.200
How could you keep
this from me?

13:30.244 --> 13:31.332
I should have
told you. I know.

13:31.375 --> 13:33.290
But I'm telling you now.

13:33.334 --> 13:35.031
We can't collaborate
with Darius Tanz

13:35.075 --> 13:36.337
or the United States government.

13:36.380 --> 13:38.034
You have a better solution?

13:38.078 --> 13:40.471
Yes. Dr. Raul Aguirre.

13:40.515 --> 13:42.386
His specialty is nanomaterials.

13:42.430 --> 13:44.040
This is his area of expertise.

13:44.084 --> 13:46.521
Raul Aguirre? Nobody's
laid eyes on him in years.

13:46.564 --> 13:48.479
He is the J.D. Salinger
of scientists.

13:48.523 --> 13:50.481
RE/SYST couldn't get him
to show up the first time.

13:50.525 --> 13:51.961
Why do you think
he'd change his mind now?

13:52.005 --> 13:53.876
We're going deep,

13:53.920 --> 13:55.269
reaching out to all corners
of the world to find him.

13:55.312 --> 13:57.793
In the meantime,

13:57.837 --> 14:00.622
RE/SYST will never
collaborate with Darius.

14:00.665 --> 14:03.581
End of discussion.Well, I thought
I get a vote

14:03.625 --> 14:05.975
now that I'm in the club.

14:06.019 --> 14:06.889
Yeah. But you're outnumbered.

14:13.026 --> 14:16.029
Of course. Rail gun discussions
at 3:00 p.m.

14:16.072 --> 14:18.161
with Planetary Defense.

14:18.205 --> 14:20.337
Yeah, uh, I'll let him know.

14:25.168 --> 14:27.692
Children of Planet Earth.

14:27.736 --> 14:30.608
NARRATOR: COPE was founded
by Bass Shepherd,

14:30.652 --> 14:33.873
author of 15 best-selling
self-help books

14:33.916 --> 14:36.876
that have sold nine million
copies worldwide,

14:36.919 --> 14:39.922
and has turned his decades-long
search for peace and acceptance

14:39.966 --> 14:40.967
into a movement.

14:41.010 --> 14:42.925
Let Bass Shepherd help you...

14:42.969 --> 14:44.971
The vice president's office.
This is Jillian.

14:45.014 --> 14:47.887
LIAM:
Jillian.

14:47.930 --> 14:49.366
Jillian, it's me.

14:49.410 --> 14:52.065
Liam, are

14:52.108 --> 14:53.196
Yeah.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.198
Look, I'm-I'm sorry

14:55.242 --> 14:58.027
about how we left things.

14:58.071 --> 14:59.637
I need you to do me a favor.

15:02.989 --> 15:05.643
And this flash drive
belonged to Claire?The NSA is working

15:05.687 --> 15:07.819
on cracking the password
to the bitcoin wallet.

15:07.863 --> 15:09.517
Good. Whatever's on there--
I want to know about it

15:09.560 --> 15:11.432
before anyone else.

15:11.475 --> 15:13.303
Of course, Mr. Vice President.
I'll keep you in the loop.

15:13.347 --> 15:15.088
Don't call me that.

15:15.131 --> 15:17.220
Why not?

15:26.795 --> 15:28.797
I've, uh...

15:28.840 --> 15:30.930
I've tendered my resignation
to Mackenzie.

15:30.973 --> 15:33.323
What

15:33.367 --> 15:35.935
The rail gun project can't
afford to fall any more behind.

15:35.978 --> 15:38.676
After the Unity Rally
we'll announce it,

15:38.720 --> 15:40.113
but I'd like to have
a successor in place.

15:40.156 --> 15:42.332
Uh, of course. I'll draw up
a list of candidates.

15:42.376 --> 15:43.725
Don't bother.

15:43.768 --> 15:45.814
I think Harris would
be a good choice.

15:45.857 --> 15:47.337
What do you think?

15:47.381 --> 15:48.556
I think you're right.

15:51.037 --> 15:54.127
Just as I was getting used to
calling you Mr. Vice President.

15:54.170 --> 15:55.519
I certainly
won't miss that,

15:55.563 --> 15:57.782
nor having the Secret Service

15:57.826 --> 16:00.611
following me around
every waking moment.

16:00.655 --> 16:04.224
I will, however, miss
seeing you every day.

16:04.267 --> 16:09.751
Oh, I'll miss
having you around.

16:09.794 --> 16:12.623
Actually, I was
hoping we could

16:12.667 --> 16:15.409
see more of each
other, not less.

16:18.368 --> 16:19.717
JILLIAN:
Darius.

16:19.761 --> 16:21.328
Sorry to interrupt,
but it's urgent.

16:21.371 --> 16:22.851
Liam called.

16:22.894 --> 16:24.244
He wants to meet.

16:32.208 --> 16:34.645
My hacker pal at the NSA
couldn't crack it

16:34.689 --> 16:36.125
and he's the best.

16:36.169 --> 16:38.475
You're kidding me.I don't kid.

16:38.519 --> 16:40.390
But he did find a secret message

16:40.434 --> 16:42.044
buried in a hidden folder
on the device.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.524
"Don't Tread on Me."

16:43.567 --> 16:45.265
GRACE:
"Don't Tread on Me."

16:45.308 --> 16:48.094
It's from the Gadsden flag flown
during the American Revolution.

16:48.137 --> 16:49.573
HUGH:
Bingo.

16:49.617 --> 16:52.272
GRACE: Yeah, the coiled
snake was a symbol

16:52.315 --> 16:53.490
of the colonies' defiance.

16:56.363 --> 16:58.713
HARRIS: Well, how does this
help us with the encryption key?

16:58.756 --> 17:00.584
It's less than
14 alphanumeric characters,

17:00.628 --> 17:02.499
so it can't be the password.HUGH: And if we guess wrong,

17:02.543 --> 17:04.284
it's six days till we try again.

17:04.327 --> 17:06.155
I recommend we go
to Bennett, fast.

17:06.199 --> 17:08.940
No. No, I can't
give Bennett a deal.

17:08.984 --> 17:11.160
He should rot in hell
for everything he's done.

17:11.204 --> 17:13.206
He should, but we're playing
a dangerous game here,

17:13.249 --> 17:15.208
trying to save the planet
and keep the country intact.

17:15.251 --> 17:16.992
He has answers;
we need them.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.254
Harris, you can't
make it personal.

17:18.298 --> 17:20.300
How can it not be?Well, there is

17:20.343 --> 17:22.215
one other person who
might be able to help.

17:22.258 --> 17:23.607
Alonzo?

17:23.651 --> 17:25.870
Grace, has it occurred to you

17:25.914 --> 17:27.655
that getting in bed
with Claire's brother

17:27.698 --> 17:29.265
is a dangerously reckless
proposition?

17:29.309 --> 17:32.225
Yes, but we need answers and
we're running out of time.

17:32.268 --> 17:34.357
Alonzo or Bennett,
dealer's choice.

17:41.756 --> 17:43.279
Hands on your head, sir!Yeah, yeah.

17:43.323 --> 17:45.542
Yeah.

17:47.631 --> 17:49.981
I'm unarmed. Hey.

17:51.853 --> 17:53.115
:
Geez.

17:53.159 --> 17:55.465
AGENT:
All clear.

17:55.509 --> 17:57.467
All clear.
All clear.

17:57.511 --> 17:58.729
DARIUS:
Liam.

18:01.950 --> 18:03.517
I asked you to come alone.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.693
This is as alone
as I get these days.

18:05.736 --> 18:10.306
So, you've finally come
to your senses.

18:10.350 --> 18:14.702
I have a proposal.
Let's merge our projects.

18:14.745 --> 18:17.139
Our solar sail,
your rail gun.

18:17.183 --> 18:20.925
So this means that your tiny
little plan has hit a wall.

18:20.969 --> 18:22.405
I guess holding
the world hostage

18:22.449 --> 18:23.624
isn't working out so well.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.974
We have had a few setbacks,

18:26.017 --> 18:27.802
but I'm guessing
you're behind schedule

18:27.845 --> 18:29.804
based on the scope
of what's required

18:29.847 --> 18:31.414
to get that rail
gun operational.

18:31.458 --> 18:33.373
Our solar sail works.

18:33.416 --> 18:35.810
It is just a little
smaller than we planned.

18:35.853 --> 18:37.681
Your rail gun may not
be finished in time.

18:37.725 --> 18:39.857
You'll never get enough
shots fired at the asteroid

18:39.901 --> 18:42.338
to move it sufficiently off
its course. But together,

18:42.382 --> 18:45.167
we each bring half of the
force needed to the table

18:45.211 --> 18:48.083
and provide all the force needed
to move that asteroid.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.564
And you think that after
everything RE/SYST has done

18:50.607 --> 18:52.696
that I would trust them?

18:52.740 --> 18:54.263
I'm not asking you
to trust RE/SYST.

18:54.307 --> 18:55.873
I'm asking you to trust me.

18:59.007 --> 19:02.445
Seems like I'm not the only one
who didn't come alone.

19:02.489 --> 19:04.578
Send her up.
Who?

19:04.621 --> 19:06.754
Bring her in.Your girlfriend.

19:12.194 --> 19:14.588
Hello, Darius.

19:14.631 --> 19:16.067
Gentlemen, keep your guns
trained on Ms. Vrettou

19:16.111 --> 19:18.983
at all times
'cause right now

19:19.027 --> 19:20.594
she's the most dangerous
woman in the world.

19:31.126 --> 19:32.910
You followed me?What makes you think

19:32.954 --> 19:34.782
you have the authority
to cut a deal with him?

19:34.825 --> 19:37.263
And what makes you think
I'd trust either of you?

19:37.306 --> 19:39.178
Still paranoid, I see.

19:39.221 --> 19:41.005
Some things never change.

19:41.049 --> 19:44.574
Whose idea was it to steal Tess,
my company, my life's work?

19:44.618 --> 19:47.273
And this isn't the first time.
Did she mention that, Liam?

19:47.316 --> 19:50.493
That she's a liar
and a thief?
I created Tess.

19:50.537 --> 19:53.104
Tanz Industries created her
under my supervision

19:53.148 --> 19:54.932
and you were paid for your work,
quite handsomely

19:54.976 --> 19:56.325
I might add.

19:56.369 --> 19:59.589
Then you tried to make her
AI software open source,

19:59.633 --> 20:00.677
knowing full well how
dangerous that would be

20:00.721 --> 20:02.157
in the wrong hands.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.377
You mean any hands
that weren't yours?

20:04.420 --> 20:07.945
'Cause you love all this.

20:07.989 --> 20:11.340
People flocking to you like
you're some sort of messiah.

20:11.384 --> 20:13.864
But the truth is, you're
just another tyrant.

20:13.908 --> 20:17.390
Said the person
holding nuclear bombs

20:17.433 --> 20:18.565
over the world's head.

20:18.608 --> 20:19.914
Oh, you are such
a hypocrite...

20:19.957 --> 20:21.568
I made you from nothing,

20:21.611 --> 20:23.439
gave you a home,

20:23.483 --> 20:25.398
and you betrayed me.Enough!

20:25.441 --> 20:28.662
The two of you need
to put this feud on ice,

20:28.705 --> 20:30.620
at least until after
we save the planet.

20:30.664 --> 20:33.144
I had to make peace with Croft
and he tried to kill me.

20:33.188 --> 20:35.495
I mean, seriously.

20:39.281 --> 20:41.022
All right.

20:41.065 --> 20:44.591
I'll consider a collaboration
on two conditions.

20:44.634 --> 20:46.245
RE/SYST disarms
their nuclear weapons...

20:46.288 --> 20:47.985
Absolutely not.

20:48.029 --> 20:50.249
...and vacates Tanz Industries.
I want my company back.

20:50.292 --> 20:52.076
We can't agree to either.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.600
Those nukes are the only
leverage we've got.

20:53.643 --> 20:56.516
Right, Liam?

20:56.559 --> 20:58.953
Oh, so it's official.

20:58.996 --> 21:00.433
You've joined

21:00.476 --> 21:02.435
their merry band of thieves.

21:02.478 --> 21:03.697
We're done.

21:12.227 --> 21:14.142
ALONZO:
"Don't Tread on Me"?

21:14.185 --> 21:16.187
Does that have any
significance to you?

21:16.231 --> 21:19.887
When we were kids,
Claire and I had a neighbor.

21:19.930 --> 21:23.586
Used to fly a "Don't Tread on
Me" flag in front of his house.

21:23.630 --> 21:26.110
We called him Mr. Don't.
Mean son of a bitch.

21:26.154 --> 21:28.983
If this was supposed
to remind her of her password,

21:29.026 --> 21:31.072
what would she be
reminding herself of?

21:31.115 --> 21:32.682
Claire didn't like Mr. Don't.

21:32.726 --> 21:37.034
But... she loved his dog.

21:37.078 --> 21:39.341
She used to walk it every
damn day after school,

21:39.385 --> 21:40.560
her first job.

21:40.603 --> 21:43.171
And?Well, this is a reach,

21:43.214 --> 21:45.304
but the dog's name was, um,

21:45.347 --> 21:47.393
Barkus Aurelius.

21:47.436 --> 21:49.003
You know, like a play
on Marcus Aurelius.

21:49.046 --> 21:50.265
Yeah, the Roman emperor.
We get it.

21:52.223 --> 21:53.790
It's 14 letters.

21:53.834 --> 21:55.314
If it's wrong,

21:55.357 --> 21:57.316
we're locked out
from trying again for six days.

22:05.367 --> 22:08.631
Okay, here we go.

22:25.735 --> 22:27.258
All right.

22:27.302 --> 22:29.348
ALONZO: These look like
outgoing payments.

22:29.391 --> 22:30.436
Payments for what?

22:30.479 --> 22:32.438
How much money is left
in the account?

22:32.481 --> 22:34.918
ALONZO:
1,428 bitcoins.

22:34.962 --> 22:36.572
That's about
$10 million.

22:38.313 --> 22:41.751
Okay, so we don't know who
the payments were made to,

22:41.795 --> 22:45.102
but we have dates
and amounts paid.

22:45.146 --> 22:49.498
May 25, that was the day
of Zoe's graduation...

22:49.542 --> 22:51.282
and the day
Carnahan was murdered.

22:51.326 --> 22:53.459
Pentagon analyst.

22:53.502 --> 22:54.982
This.

23:00.988 --> 23:03.382
This was the day an assassin
was sent to my house.

23:03.425 --> 23:06.341
And this is the day
that reporter, Amanda Neel,

23:06.385 --> 23:07.951
died in a fire at Capitol Eyes.

23:07.995 --> 23:10.824
Those are payments for hits
coming from my sister's account.

23:12.434 --> 23:14.262
What just happened?

23:14.305 --> 23:15.611
HARRIS:
Account's still active.

23:15.655 --> 23:17.744
That's an outgoing payment
in the neighborhood of

23:17.787 --> 23:19.136
$500,000.

23:19.180 --> 23:21.574
Oh, my God,
they have a new target.

23:21.617 --> 23:25.491
Harris, you have to make
a deal with Bennett, now.

23:34.021 --> 23:35.065
Open up.

23:39.853 --> 23:41.071
Bennett?

23:41.115 --> 23:42.769
Bennett.

23:47.730 --> 23:50.385
He's dead.
What the hell happened here?

23:50.429 --> 23:51.865
Sir, no idea.

23:51.908 --> 23:54.607
He was alive ten minutes ago.
Nobody went in or out.

23:54.650 --> 23:57.261
Okay, lock this place down,
and get me the security footage.

23:57.305 --> 23:59.394
Nobody leaves this facility
until I say so.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.962
Yes, sir.

24:02.005 --> 24:04.791
What the hell?

24:07.097 --> 24:09.099
S-So what, Bennett was-was
killed by a ghost?

24:09.143 --> 24:11.101
What is this,
amateur hour at the Pentagon?

24:11.145 --> 24:13.190
How the hell did
this happen, Harris?

24:13.234 --> 24:14.888
We've checked the security
footage, Madam President.

24:14.931 --> 24:17.543
It's inexplicable.
Nobody came in or out.

24:17.586 --> 24:20.371
Bennett has a microscopic
wound in his head that came

24:20.415 --> 24:22.243
from nothing visible
to the naked eye.

24:22.286 --> 24:24.941
Well, somehow, someone
had access to Bennett.DARIUS: Or something.

24:24.985 --> 24:27.596
It's a locked room riddle,

24:27.640 --> 24:29.598
except the room isn't sealed,
it's-it's got air vents.

24:29.642 --> 24:32.427
Something small, like a,
like a, like a microdrone,

24:32.471 --> 24:34.690
could have infiltrated.MACKENZIE: Microdrone?

24:34.734 --> 24:36.170
Sounds like science fiction.

24:36.213 --> 24:37.606
Well, it's science fact.
I've used the technology myself.

24:37.650 --> 24:38.825
Not for murder, of course.

24:38.868 --> 24:41.131
About this
bitcoin wallet, ma'am,

24:41.175 --> 24:42.698
and the fact that someone
is a target.

24:42.742 --> 24:44.700
Well, clearly,
the target was Bennett,

24:44.744 --> 24:46.746
and the job is done.We can't take that chance.

24:46.789 --> 24:49.139
We need to cancel
the Unity Rally,

24:49.183 --> 24:51.098
for both of your safety.That is out of the question.

24:51.141 --> 24:53.013
The networks are carrying it.

24:53.056 --> 24:55.363
We've publicized
the hell out of it.

24:55.406 --> 24:57.234
The morale of this country
has suffered so

24:57.278 --> 24:58.801
that to cancel this
could plunge us into despair.

24:58.845 --> 25:00.150
Now is the time to strike,

25:00.194 --> 25:01.500
before word of Bennett's
death gets out.

25:01.543 --> 25:03.763
Ma'am, if I could second

25:03.806 --> 25:06.417
Secretary Edwards on this...You can second, third,
or fourth it, Grace,

25:06.461 --> 25:07.723
but we cannot
stop every time

25:07.767 --> 25:09.812
there is a perceived
threat that looms.

25:09.856 --> 25:11.684
Life must go on,
and we must live it,

25:11.727 --> 25:12.815
must live it with courage.

25:14.251 --> 25:15.862
Right. I need to go.

25:15.905 --> 25:19.169
Harris, footage of Bennett.
I want everything you've got.

25:19.213 --> 25:21.084
There's nothing on there,
Darius; I already

25:21.128 --> 25:23.260
went through it.Yeah, well, I haven't.

25:28.962 --> 25:30.746
Harris, we can't let this rally
go forward tomorrow.

25:30.790 --> 25:32.356
We have to talk
Mackenzie out of it.

25:32.400 --> 25:34.184
We couldn't talk her out
of leaving the White House

25:34.228 --> 25:35.708
when it was under siege.

25:35.751 --> 25:38.014
I don't know how we talk her out
of a glorified pep rally,

25:38.058 --> 25:40.800
especially when it appears
Bennett was the target.

25:40.843 --> 25:42.715
GRACE:
What if he wasn't?

25:42.758 --> 25:45.761
I mean, I can't handle
any more death or heartbreak.

25:45.805 --> 25:48.634
Listen, we'll have bulletproof
glass surrounding the stage,

25:48.677 --> 25:51.419
extra Secret Service.
We'll be okay.

25:51.462 --> 25:53.116
Darius is resigning.

25:53.160 --> 25:54.944
What?

25:54.988 --> 25:58.731
He has to focus on
the rail gun project.

25:58.774 --> 26:01.255
He put you at the top
of the list to succeed him.

26:01.298 --> 26:04.606
He did?
Yeah.

26:04.650 --> 26:06.652
Before I give
Mackenzie your name,

26:06.695 --> 26:08.305
do you even want this job?

26:12.483 --> 26:14.660
JILLIAN:
Oh, what's that?

26:14.703 --> 26:17.227
I developed software
for the FBI, currently in beta.

26:17.271 --> 26:19.490
It analyzes facial
and vocal tics

26:19.534 --> 26:21.884
to identify stressors,
deception.

26:21.928 --> 26:24.713
It might give us some insight

26:24.757 --> 26:26.759
into what happened.

26:26.802 --> 26:28.804
We're good.

26:31.502 --> 26:32.982
Hey, Darius.

26:34.288 --> 26:35.855
Is Liam coming back?

26:37.900 --> 26:38.858
No.

26:55.483 --> 26:58.007
We could use your
help down there.

26:58.051 --> 27:01.054
Trying to figure out
our next move.

27:01.097 --> 27:03.317
My next move is finding
Raul Aguirre.

27:03.360 --> 27:06.320
Yours, clearly,
was going behind my back

27:06.363 --> 27:08.670
and setting up
a meeting with Darius.

27:08.714 --> 27:10.933
How am I supposed
to trust you?

27:10.977 --> 27:13.283
Well, you followed me,
so, clearly, you never did.

27:13.327 --> 27:15.895
You weren't supposed to leave
without permission.

27:15.938 --> 27:17.897
Am I a member of RE/SYST?
Or am I a prisoner?

27:17.940 --> 27:20.290
Can you make up your damn mind?

27:20.334 --> 27:22.336
You're not a prisoner.
We've established that much.

27:22.379 --> 27:23.946
Fine, then as a member
of RE/SYST,

27:23.990 --> 27:26.296
it is my right to bring ideas
to the table.

27:26.340 --> 27:28.124
Now, if we can negotiate
some kind of deal

27:28.168 --> 27:31.084
to use Darius's rail gun...Stop.

27:31.127 --> 27:33.303
I told you,

27:33.347 --> 27:36.045
RE/SYST will never agree
to work with Darius.

27:36.089 --> 27:39.135
Why not?
'Cause of your personal grudge?

27:39.179 --> 27:41.703
Is that what you think?

27:41.747 --> 27:44.488
That I'd put my feelings
before saving the human race?

27:44.532 --> 27:46.577
That might be something

27:46.621 --> 27:48.101
your sensitive little writer
girlfriend might do...

27:48.144 --> 27:49.493
Don't talk about her like that.

27:52.496 --> 27:54.107
Look, Alycia,
we're running out of time.

27:54.150 --> 27:56.283
If I had to partner up
with Darth Vader right now,

27:56.326 --> 27:58.067
I'd freaking do it
to save the human race.

28:00.591 --> 28:02.768
Please.
Fine.

28:02.811 --> 28:04.813
I'll put the collaboration
proposal on the table

28:04.857 --> 28:06.859
with Nero.

28:13.213 --> 28:14.910
You were just testing
my loyalty.And you passed.

28:14.954 --> 28:17.826
You're as ruthless
as I thought.

28:17.870 --> 28:20.176
Killing Claire, covering it up.

28:20.220 --> 28:22.439
You look me in the eye
and you tell me I'm wrong.

28:25.965 --> 28:28.315
We didn't kill anyone.

28:35.539 --> 28:37.019
We didn't kill anyone.

28:45.201 --> 28:47.900
HARRIS: Darius, uh,
I wanted to thank you

28:47.943 --> 28:50.424
for trusting me enough
to put me up for VP.

28:50.467 --> 28:53.209
You killed Claire Rayburn.What?

28:53.253 --> 28:54.994
And made Grace
cover up for you.

28:55.037 --> 28:56.822
What the hell is wrong with you?

28:56.865 --> 28:59.085
That's what all the secrecy's
been about, all this time!

28:59.128 --> 29:00.739
You don't know what
you're talking about.

29:00.782 --> 29:03.263
You're the same lying son of a
bitch I always thought you were.

29:03.306 --> 29:05.047
I should have you hauled
out of here and arrested.

29:05.091 --> 29:06.701
GRACE:
Darius, stop.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.355
It's not him you should arrest.
It's me.

29:08.398 --> 29:10.879
Grace.I'm the lying son of a bitch.

29:21.150 --> 29:24.675
Harris convinced me
it would jeopardize everything.

29:24.719 --> 29:26.199
Of course he did.

29:26.242 --> 29:28.723
And I agreed with him,
at the time.

29:28.767 --> 29:31.465
The ripple effect was something
I couldn't have predicted.

29:31.508 --> 29:33.032
Ripple effect?

29:33.075 --> 29:35.686
You killed someone,
covered it up, lied under oath

29:35.730 --> 29:36.905
to the Supreme Court.

29:36.949 --> 29:38.820
Yes, I'm aware of how bad
this is, Darius.

29:38.864 --> 29:40.343
The legitimacy
of this government

29:40.387 --> 29:42.258
is hanging in the balance
and two members

29:42.302 --> 29:44.739
of the president's inner circle
perjured themselves

29:44.783 --> 29:46.741
to keep us in power.I will resign. Okay?

29:46.785 --> 29:49.091
I will take the fall.It's too late for that.

29:49.135 --> 29:50.876
If we pull that thread,
it could unravel everything

29:50.919 --> 29:52.442
we're trying to accomplish.

29:52.486 --> 29:54.705
We'll just have to...

29:54.749 --> 29:58.187
cover up the cover-up,
as it were.

29:58.231 --> 30:00.059
Darius.

30:00.102 --> 30:02.148
I'm so sorry.

30:02.191 --> 30:04.150
I didn't want to compromise you.

30:04.193 --> 30:07.718
This job has already
compromised me in ways

30:07.762 --> 30:09.808
I could never have imagined.

30:09.851 --> 30:11.940
The sooner we
have this rally,

30:11.984 --> 30:14.813
the sooner I can resign,
and that's not soon enough.

30:25.911 --> 30:28.652
I thought you gave up.Hmm.

30:28.696 --> 30:30.132
What is this?

30:30.176 --> 30:32.787
It's your rail gun/solar sail
combo platter.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.745
I actually think it might work.

30:34.789 --> 30:36.399
I just don't
know how big

30:36.443 --> 30:39.925
this rail gun is,
and knowing Darius,

30:39.968 --> 30:44.364
clearly he's a man who cares
about whose gun is biggest.

30:44.407 --> 30:46.409
Anyway, I'm trying
to do the math...

30:46.453 --> 30:48.411
Oh, it's not about the math
as much as getting

30:48.455 --> 30:50.631
Darius and RE/SYST
to play nice.

30:50.674 --> 30:53.852
Well, maybe you don't have to.

30:53.895 --> 30:56.724
Get them to
play nice, I mean.

30:56.767 --> 30:57.725
What are you talking about?

30:57.768 --> 31:00.032
Well, just...

31:00.075 --> 31:02.904
take the solar sail and,
you know...

31:05.428 --> 31:08.257
DefectYeah, yeah.

31:08.301 --> 31:09.693
Mm-hmm.

31:09.737 --> 31:13.741
Thanks, but betraying people
and running off

31:13.784 --> 31:15.264
with their stuff
is more your thing.

31:15.308 --> 31:17.527
RE/SYST are analyzing
my proposal.

31:17.571 --> 31:20.226
I have to believe they'll
come to their senses.
Hmm.

31:20.269 --> 31:22.228
After all the people
who have betrayed you,

31:22.271 --> 31:24.230
you remain adorably optimistic
about human beings.

31:24.273 --> 31:26.319
Not all of them, Croft.

31:31.933 --> 31:33.195
GRACE:
I lied

31:33.239 --> 31:34.501
to the president,
the Supreme Court,

31:34.544 --> 31:36.024
and now I've burdened
the one man

31:36.068 --> 31:38.897
with the fate of the world
on his back.

31:38.940 --> 31:40.724
When you're in
the fog of war,

31:40.768 --> 31:42.335
it's impossible
to see things clearly.

31:42.378 --> 31:44.467
You make the best
decision you can

31:44.511 --> 31:45.860
with the information
you're given,

31:45.904 --> 31:47.470
and you don't look back, ever.

31:47.514 --> 31:49.081
All I do is look back.

31:49.124 --> 31:51.300
It's time.

31:51.344 --> 31:54.129
After the Unity Rally,
I need to turn myself in.

31:54.173 --> 31:55.739
Grace, no good
can come from that.

31:55.783 --> 31:57.959
If anything, it'll make things
worse for everyone.

31:58.003 --> 31:59.047
I can't live like this anymore.

32:01.484 --> 32:03.878
I just can't.

32:32.733 --> 32:37.172
What is our purpose?

32:37.216 --> 32:41.916
Now more than ever,
we contemplate what to do

32:41.960 --> 32:45.050
with the time that we have left.

32:45.093 --> 32:47.052
We feel powerless.

32:47.095 --> 32:50.011
We can't stop the will
of the universe.

32:50.055 --> 32:52.274
So what do we do
with those emotions?

32:52.318 --> 32:54.276
CROWD: COPE.BASS: And how do we COPE?

32:54.320 --> 32:56.061
CROWD:
Acceptance.

32:56.104 --> 33:00.021
BASS: It pains us to leave
business unresolved.

33:00.065 --> 33:03.024
Potential unfulfilled.

33:03.068 --> 33:05.244
Afraid of what the future holds,

33:05.287 --> 33:09.074
we live lives of fear
and regret,

33:09.117 --> 33:13.165
always wanting more time.

33:13.208 --> 33:16.211
But time is a curse.

33:16.255 --> 33:18.518
The more we have,
the more we wait.

33:18.561 --> 33:21.390
We put things off,
we live untruthful lives.

33:21.434 --> 33:24.263
We refuse to accept
that everybody dies.

33:28.615 --> 33:29.790
I was surprised
to hear from you.

33:29.833 --> 33:31.313
Thought you were retired.

33:31.357 --> 33:33.794
With the impending
apocalypse and civil wars,

33:33.837 --> 33:36.101
who has the time

33:36.144 --> 33:38.016
Truth be told,
I could use the R&R.

33:38.059 --> 33:40.018
I was hoping the agency
could help me out.

33:40.061 --> 33:41.628
Since when do we tell the truth?

33:43.325 --> 33:46.459
You sure you want to
go through with this?

33:46.502 --> 33:47.851
Once you turn yourself in,
there's no going back.

33:47.895 --> 33:49.070
I know.

33:49.114 --> 33:51.638
But I killed Claire Rayburn.

33:51.681 --> 33:55.076
And I need to be
held accountable.

33:55.120 --> 33:57.818
We are free.

33:57.861 --> 34:00.081
Free of the future.

34:00.125 --> 34:02.953
And what do we do with our fear?

34:02.997 --> 34:06.044
CROWD:
Set it on fire!

34:06.087 --> 34:08.568
BASS: If you feel moved
to free yourself,

34:08.611 --> 34:10.526
I invite you to come forward.

34:13.442 --> 34:15.966
What are you
afraid of?

34:16.010 --> 34:17.968
I'm afraid of the great unknown.

34:18.012 --> 34:19.622
CROWD:
Accept the great unknown.

34:19.666 --> 34:20.971
WOMAN:
I accept.

34:21.015 --> 34:22.495
Do you want to go up there?

34:22.538 --> 34:25.019
It feels amazing
to just accept.

34:27.413 --> 34:31.025
BASS: My friend, what
are you afraid of?

34:31.069 --> 34:32.722
I'm afraid of being powerless.

34:32.766 --> 34:34.420
CROWD:
Accept being powerless.

34:34.463 --> 34:37.771
MAN:
I accept.

34:37.814 --> 34:42.167
BASS:
Who else wants to accept?

34:45.996 --> 34:47.781
Um...

34:49.522 --> 34:52.046
I'm...

34:54.396 --> 34:56.877
I don't know
what I'm doing here.

34:56.920 --> 34:59.009
Sorry.It's all right.

34:59.053 --> 35:02.056
You came here
for a reason.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.145
So talk to me. I'm listening.

35:04.189 --> 35:05.755
What are you
afraid of?

35:07.844 --> 35:09.933
Everything.

35:09.977 --> 35:12.197
Losing the people
I love,

35:12.240 --> 35:14.024
dying.

35:14.068 --> 35:16.462
I-I hate...

35:16.505 --> 35:18.725
I hate everything
that is happening,

35:18.768 --> 35:21.902
and I can't accept it,
and I don't want to accept it.

35:21.945 --> 35:24.078
And I don't know how all
of you can just accept

35:24.122 --> 35:25.819
what's happening. Sorry.

35:25.862 --> 35:28.126
What choice do we have?

35:28.169 --> 35:32.217
Look at all this energy
being wasted in denial.

35:34.523 --> 35:37.961
Those who have accepted,
look at them: they smile.

35:38.005 --> 35:41.313
They laugh. They're free.

35:41.356 --> 35:44.707
Those who have not
accepted, they struggle.

35:44.751 --> 35:48.276
Accept that everything dies,

35:48.320 --> 35:53.281
and you will never know
fear or heartache again.

35:53.325 --> 35:57.459
I accept that everything dies.

36:10.080 --> 36:11.995
I think you should take it back.

36:13.736 --> 36:16.478
I accept that everything dies.

36:16.522 --> 36:19.786
Including love.

36:19.829 --> 36:23.268
You, you are strong.

36:23.311 --> 36:27.010
And you can cope.

36:27.054 --> 36:28.708
I can cope.

36:40.415 --> 36:42.374
Ready?

36:47.944 --> 36:50.947
Good evening.
After careful review,

36:50.991 --> 36:53.167
RE/SYST has
reached a decision.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.517
We approve your plan
to use the rail gun

36:55.561 --> 36:57.519
and the solar sail, Galileo.

36:57.563 --> 37:00.435
Great. Great. That's just great.

37:00.479 --> 37:02.089
I'll contact
Darius immediately.

37:02.132 --> 37:04.265
Darius Tanz will
not be involved.

37:04.309 --> 37:05.875
He cannot be trusted.Wait.

37:05.919 --> 37:07.137
To facilitate
this project,

37:07.181 --> 37:08.922
the United States government

37:08.965 --> 37:10.619
will turn over
their rail gun to us.

37:10.663 --> 37:11.838
Wait. That-that
wasn't an option.

37:11.881 --> 37:13.796
They'll never agree to that.

37:13.840 --> 37:15.276
If they fail to comply,
they will be given five hours

37:15.320 --> 37:17.191
to evacuate New York City

37:17.235 --> 37:20.716
before we deploy one of our
orbiting nuclear warheads.

37:20.760 --> 37:22.370
Hold on a second.
Can we discuss this?

37:22.414 --> 37:24.633
My decision is final.

37:24.677 --> 37:26.766
Did you know about this?

37:26.809 --> 37:29.943
I'm sorry, Liam.
I tried to tell you...

37:29.986 --> 37:31.336
That RE/SYST was gonna
blow up a major city?

37:31.379 --> 37:32.859
That Nero could be ruthless.

37:32.902 --> 37:34.817
Yeah, well, so can I.

37:34.861 --> 37:36.166
Liam, wait.

37:36.210 --> 37:38.212
LIAM:
Listen up!

37:38.256 --> 37:39.431
I need everyone's attention!

37:41.084 --> 37:43.391
RE/SYST has learned

37:43.435 --> 37:46.568
the United States government
is building a giant rail gun.

37:46.612 --> 37:48.831
Now, combined
with our solar sail,

37:48.875 --> 37:52.835
we could actually knock Samson
off course and save the planet.

37:52.879 --> 37:54.533
Liam, don't do this.

37:54.576 --> 37:56.578
But RE/SYST would rather
threaten the lives

37:56.622 --> 37:59.842
of millions of people
than even entertain the idea

37:59.886 --> 38:02.410
of collaborating
with Darius Tanz.

38:02.454 --> 38:04.194
Now, if this is
the true face of RE/SYST,

38:04.238 --> 38:05.979
I will not be a part of it.

38:07.894 --> 38:10.853
I'm leaving.

38:10.897 --> 38:13.552
And I'm asking all of you
to come with me.

38:13.595 --> 38:15.858
Now, if you want to save the
planet, we need to walk out

38:15.902 --> 38:17.120
of here, right now.

38:18.861 --> 38:19.862
Right now.

38:25.041 --> 38:26.347
I'm ready to die
on the sword, Alycia.

38:37.750 --> 38:40.056
CROFT:
Liam.

38:40.100 --> 38:41.580
Hey, what are you doing? You're
gonna get yourself killed.

38:41.623 --> 38:43.886
Hey, at least I'll have died
for a cause I believe in.

38:43.930 --> 38:45.714
Humanity!

38:51.633 --> 38:53.983
Oh, you're
gonna shoot me?

38:54.027 --> 38:55.376
Why? 'Cause
I disagree with you?

38:55.420 --> 38:57.465
Now who's the tyrant?

39:03.819 --> 39:06.953
Um, uh...

39:06.996 --> 39:08.911
I-I'm with Liam.

39:08.955 --> 39:10.435
You shoot him, you're gonna
have to shoot me, too.

39:19.574 --> 39:22.011
Well, I, uh, I guess
you're gonna have to shoot

39:22.055 --> 39:26.364
all of us, so good luck
with that asteroid.

39:40.769 --> 39:43.337
We're gonna do things
my way now.

39:50.083 --> 39:51.693
CROFT:
Okay.

39:51.737 --> 39:55.131
So what's next?

39:55.175 --> 39:57.133
You do have a plan, right?

40:10.408 --> 40:12.975
My fellow Americans,

40:13.019 --> 40:17.284
we are now engaged
in a struggle for survival.

40:17.327 --> 40:22.071
Not only as a nation,
but as a species.

40:22.115 --> 40:26.685
These past few weeks,
our union has been tested.

40:26.728 --> 40:30.515
But we are still standing.

40:30.558 --> 40:31.559
AGENT :
Post 11 clear.Post 12 clear.

40:31.603 --> 40:33.474
Red five standing by.

40:41.917 --> 40:45.921
Yes, I have faith
in this country,

40:45.965 --> 40:49.925
and I am so honored that
you have put your faith in me.

40:58.107 --> 40:59.718
You worried?

40:59.761 --> 41:01.502
It's okay.

41:01.546 --> 41:03.504
Is it?

41:03.548 --> 41:04.766
MACKENZIE:
Monroe Bennett sought

41:04.810 --> 41:09.336
to divide us,
but we will not be divided,

41:09.379 --> 41:13.209
for we are
the United States of America.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.391
♪

41:45.720 --> 41:48.723
Harris, knowing what I know...

41:48.767 --> 41:50.682
You can't recommend me
for vice president.

41:50.725 --> 41:53.946
I was going to take my name
out of the running anyway.

41:53.989 --> 41:56.165
Fair enough.

42:04.391 --> 42:06.480

Clear the next room.

I wish I had your faith
in humanity.

42:10.745 --> 42:12.355
You'll see, Darius.

42:12.399 --> 42:13.966
There's still good people

We have to get you

42:48.174 --> 42:49.523
