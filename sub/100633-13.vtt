WEBVTT

00:22.222 --> 00:24.725
Tawny Young reporting
live from Gotham City Hall

00:24.824 --> 00:27.059
as the mayor,
in a rare public appearance,

00:27.160 --> 00:28.728
has come out
to honor the heroes

00:28.728 --> 00:31.864
who fought so bravely
in the Battle of Gotham.

00:31.865 --> 00:35.301
I present you each
with a key to the city.

00:35.402 --> 00:37.804
There you go, Superman
and, of course, Wonder Woman

00:37.905 --> 00:39.439
and Batman.

00:39.439 --> 00:40.473
Check out that grip.

00:40.573 --> 00:42.075
There you go, space cabbie.

00:42.075 --> 00:43.210
Couldn't have
done it without you.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.359
Who the fuck are these guys?

00:44.359 --> 00:45.746
Commissioner Gordon,
what do you think

00:45.746 --> 00:47.280
of this beautiful ceremony?

00:47.381 --> 00:49.448
I'm just so honored to be
getting a key to the city

00:49.549 --> 00:51.283
seeing as I was
here the whole time

00:51.384 --> 00:52.652
protecting lives.

00:52.652 --> 00:54.454
The Mayor's probably
saving the best for last

00:54.454 --> 00:56.189
like I did with
the <i>Mission Impossible</i> movies.

00:56.189 --> 00:57.624
I watched one first

00:57.725 --> 00:59.792
-but then I went to four--
-Mmm-hmm. Let's listen.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.262
There's one last person
I need to thank today.

01:02.362 --> 01:04.697
If it weren't for him,
our city would still be riddled

01:04.798 --> 01:06.233
with supervillains.

01:06.233 --> 01:08.468
This mustachioed
servant of the people

01:08.569 --> 01:09.670
may not have powers

01:09.769 --> 01:12.272
but, man, he sure is super.

01:12.272 --> 01:13.340
That's right, citizens.

01:13.439 --> 01:15.742
I hereby honor myself.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.376
-[public cheering]
-What? What about me?

01:17.477 --> 01:18.679
We helped this city together.

01:18.778 --> 01:20.000
Not him.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.515
Seriously,
I think I've seen this guy

01:21.515 --> 01:23.617
like one other time,
like, ever.

01:23.716 --> 01:25.686
[theme music playing]

01:29.522 --> 01:32.325
Dr. Psycho, check.

01:32.426 --> 01:35.128
Riddler, check.
Welcome back, by the way.

01:35.962 --> 01:37.496
Harley Quinn!

01:37.597 --> 01:39.132
[scoffs] Don't tell me...

01:39.132 --> 01:40.433
You're not supposed to be here.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.536
Is anyone supposed
to be anywhere?

01:42.536 --> 01:43.670
Oh, you wanna talk about it?

01:43.670 --> 01:44.772
Maybe over a fruit cup.

01:44.871 --> 01:45.893
Nah... [sighs]

01:45.893 --> 01:47.406
I wanna be alone
with my thoughts.

01:47.406 --> 01:49.509
Don't worry about me.
I'll break out when I'm done.

01:49.509 --> 01:51.210
I'm just going through
a personal crisis.

01:51.210 --> 01:52.778
Actually, I'll take
that fruit cup though.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.915
Well, fruit cup
in exchange for conversation.

01:55.015 --> 01:56.917
Sort of linchpin
of this whole social contract.

01:57.016 --> 02:00.375
-So... I'm gonna go.
-[sighs]

02:00.820 --> 02:03.689
Look, thank you for giving
me a chance to talk to you.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.325
-[sighs]
-Why did you do it?

02:05.424 --> 02:08.193
[stutters] I don't know.
I fucked up.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.463
I wish I had a better answer.

02:10.563 --> 02:11.698
I love you.

02:11.799 --> 02:14.234
That Harley stuff
was a stupid fling

02:14.334 --> 02:15.531
and a mistake.

02:15.531 --> 02:17.437
And I promise
it will never happen again.

02:17.437 --> 02:18.705
If you don't want to marry me,

02:18.705 --> 02:20.473
just say it
so I can go to a bar,

02:20.473 --> 02:22.675
and get loaded and get
into an argument with somebody

02:22.675 --> 02:24.844
about what the most
metal album of all time is.

02:24.944 --> 02:26.278
And then start crying

02:26.278 --> 02:27.713
for no reason
and puke on myself

02:27.814 --> 02:31.251
Oh, Kite Man, I do.
I do want to marry you.

02:31.251 --> 02:32.252
And if you, you know,

02:32.352 --> 02:33.586
were a metal album,

02:33.586 --> 02:34.820
you'd be
<i>Appetite for Destruction.</i>

02:34.822 --> 02:35.954
-You know...
-What? What...

02:35.955 --> 02:38.258
GNR is not even metal.

02:38.358 --> 02:39.992
What are we even talking about?

02:39.993 --> 02:42.228
-Is this--
-Chuck, I hate that I hurt you.

02:42.229 --> 02:43.796
You know, you
deserve everything.

02:43.796 --> 02:45.498
And I know
this doesn't fix anything.

02:45.498 --> 02:46.866
But could you pull over here?

02:49.269 --> 02:52.973
Ta-da! It's the old
Gotham corn factory.

02:53.073 --> 02:55.776
What is this?
Is this just a tour
of my failures?

02:55.876 --> 02:57.443
It's your dream wedding venue.

02:57.544 --> 02:58.677
If you still, you know,

02:58.679 --> 03:01.715
wanna get
married to this old gal.

03:01.814 --> 03:03.139
What about Condiment King?

03:03.139 --> 03:05.585
Didn't that dick face
already call dibs
on this monument

03:05.586 --> 03:06.854
to rustic perfection?

03:06.954 --> 03:07.987
So about that...

03:09.056 --> 03:10.699
[clears throat]

03:10.699 --> 03:13.794
Come to ask for an invite
to our wedding, Ivy? [guffaws]

03:13.894 --> 03:15.695
Change of plans, sauce fucker.

03:15.795 --> 03:17.396
It's Condiment King!

03:20.396 --> 03:21.534
So, you know, he just, sort of,

03:21.534 --> 03:23.569
decided to just give it to me

03:23.669 --> 03:25.705
and he is still
obviously very much alive.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.775
But he's, sort of,
like out of town indefinitely,

03:27.775 --> 03:29.475
and no one knows
if he'll ever come back,

03:29.475 --> 03:30.911
but, you know, probably not.

03:31.010 --> 03:32.913
Ivy, Kite Man, we're so happy

03:33.013 --> 03:34.715
to have you
at the old corn factory.

03:34.814 --> 03:37.484
We know your
wedding will be perfect.

03:37.584 --> 03:38.919
Wait. You risked your life

03:38.919 --> 03:40.418
against one of the most
formidable villains

03:40.419 --> 03:41.655
Gotham has ever seen

03:41.754 --> 03:43.256
just to give me my dream venue?

03:43.256 --> 03:45.391
I think that's maybe
like an overstatement

03:45.491 --> 03:47.961
of Condiment King.
But essentially, yes.

03:48.062 --> 03:50.497
That's what I did
because I love you.

03:50.597 --> 03:51.998
So... [sighs]
What do you say?

03:52.098 --> 03:54.467
You wanna get married or what?

03:54.568 --> 03:55.936
Wow. This is
a lot to think about.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.604
You, probably,
can't tell right now,

03:57.605 --> 03:59.673
but I am tots overwhelmed.

03:59.772 --> 04:01.675
Look, just take your time.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.776
You know, just know
that it's waiting for you

04:03.776 --> 04:04.776
if you want it.

04:06.680 --> 04:07.680
[sirens wailing]

04:09.082 --> 04:10.783
Why are you so calm, Gordo?

04:10.883 --> 04:13.486
Aren't you excited to see
me going back to Arkham?

04:13.486 --> 04:15.489
I'm a complex man
with many emotions.

04:15.588 --> 04:16.956
that must be sifted through.

04:16.956 --> 04:18.725
The Mayor didn't give
you the key to the city

04:18.725 --> 04:20.627
-and now you're sad.
-I don't have a key, goddammit!

04:20.627 --> 04:22.394
I mean, no,
that's not it at all.

04:22.495 --> 04:23.697
That was a dumb guess.

04:24.130 --> 04:25.540
Dummy!

04:26.500 --> 04:28.334
Let me give you
a little piece of advice.

04:28.334 --> 04:29.502
You don't wanna be the one

04:29.502 --> 04:30.803
who gets the key to the city,

04:30.903 --> 04:32.805
you wanna be
the one who gives it.

04:33.807 --> 04:34.975
Yeah, Gordo.

04:35.074 --> 04:37.410
You should run for mayor.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.446
I got into public service
to shoot bad guys

04:39.545 --> 04:41.413
while allowing
for the occasional accidental

04:41.413 --> 04:43.550
shooting of an innocent,
because no one's perfect!

04:43.550 --> 04:44.718
I don't even like politics.

04:44.817 --> 04:46.319
Well, I love 'em.

04:46.418 --> 04:48.454
Come on, let's overthrow
Mayor What's-his-name?

04:48.555 --> 04:51.057
I can run your whole
campaign from behind bars

04:51.158 --> 04:53.360
like a real campaign manager.

04:53.459 --> 04:56.096
No!

04:56.096 --> 04:57.697
But let's just say
for argument's sake

04:57.697 --> 04:58.764
I want the job.

04:58.764 --> 04:59.944
Being the police commissioner

04:59.944 --> 05:00.944
of the most
dangerous city in America,

05:01.035 --> 05:02.281
I got low favorables.

05:02.281 --> 05:04.670
You also seem like
a hair-trigger reactionary

05:04.771 --> 05:06.639
kind of guy
who runs his mouth off

05:06.639 --> 05:07.874
when he's backed into a corner.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.043
That's bullshit.

05:09.043 --> 05:10.843
Say that to my fucking face!

05:10.944 --> 05:12.612
Ah-ha! See, you're a cop,

05:12.713 --> 05:14.048
but you're not a hero.

05:14.148 --> 05:16.483
Unless, you do something heroic

05:16.583 --> 05:18.084
that gets your
name in the papers.

05:18.185 --> 05:21.721
Cuffing your occasional
costumed psycho isn't splashy.

05:21.721 --> 05:23.355
But guess what?

05:23.456 --> 05:25.791
A little bird told me
that Ivy and Kite Man

05:25.892 --> 05:27.627
are getting
married on Saturday.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.562
And I've got their guest list.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.963
[laughing]

05:31.000 --> 05:33.466
All these criminals
will be in attendance

05:33.567 --> 05:35.535
-with their guard down.
-Wait a minute.

05:35.634 --> 05:36.903
I just have an idea.

05:36.903 --> 05:38.605
I bust that wedding
and I become a hero

05:38.704 --> 05:39.839
as big as Batman.

05:39.939 --> 05:43.475
Now you're
getting it, Mr. Mayor.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.081
Hey, there, sweetheart.
Why so gloom?

05:48.182 --> 05:49.548
What are you guys doing here?

05:49.649 --> 05:51.918
-Really?
-[overlapping chatter]

05:52.019 --> 05:54.887
So did you get
the paperless post reminder?

05:54.987 --> 05:56.555
Ivy's wedding is on.

05:56.656 --> 05:58.625
And the bride
still wants you to come.

05:58.725 --> 05:59.826
[sighs] I'm not going.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.399
I'll just be a distraction

06:01.399 --> 06:03.163
and like Ivy said,
I always fuck everything up.

06:03.163 --> 06:05.464
It's your goddamn
best friend's wedding!

06:05.564 --> 06:06.651
Yeah and for once,

06:06.651 --> 06:08.168
I wanna make
the right choice.
Restraint.

06:08.269 --> 06:09.802
Everyone wants you there.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.737
And you wouldn't want
to miss my performance

06:11.838 --> 06:12.939
of an aria.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.074
I'll be singing
at the reception.

06:15.074 --> 06:17.110
Did we mention there's
going to be vanilla cake?

06:17.110 --> 06:18.946
-I'm not going.
-I'll save you a seat.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.983
So you're bailing
on your best friend's wedding?

06:24.084 --> 06:25.886
Why is everyone so chatty?

06:25.985 --> 06:28.187
This place used to be
great for silent brooding.

06:28.288 --> 06:30.189
If you're really
worried about someone

06:30.189 --> 06:32.925
dragging Ivy's wedding
to hell in a handbasket,

06:33.026 --> 06:34.127
I got bad news.

06:34.228 --> 06:35.629
-What is it?
-Help break me out

06:35.728 --> 06:36.997
and I'll tell you.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.197
-I ain't buying it.
-All right.

06:38.197 --> 06:39.800
That's fine.

06:39.899 --> 06:42.036
Screw over your
best friend twice, I guess.

06:43.502 --> 06:44.937
-[sirens wailing]
-[alarm buzzing]

06:44.937 --> 06:46.148
-[grunting, yelling]
-Gordon's planning to arrest

06:46.148 --> 06:48.209
all the villains
at the wedding.
He told me himself.

06:48.309 --> 06:50.509
-The <i>cojones</i> on that guy.
-[grunting]

06:50.610 --> 06:52.646
How the fuck's he
going to pull that off?

06:52.745 --> 06:53.913
Oh, he probably won't.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.115
But he's gonna try.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.283
And I mean, these weddings...

06:56.283 --> 06:57.684
-Oh!
-[grunts]

06:57.685 --> 06:59.319
...they're so
meticulously planned.

06:59.319 --> 07:00.786
Anytime you throw
a wrench in it,

07:00.887 --> 07:02.656
it's like a ripple of--
[grunts]

07:02.755 --> 07:05.024
Well, if I can't fuck up
Ivy's wedding.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.826
-No one can!
-Okay.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.627
I hear bells ringing.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.833
Listen up.
I didn't just bring you in here

07:12.932 --> 07:14.201
to enjoy these vegan donuts.

07:14.300 --> 07:15.634
[retching]

07:15.735 --> 07:16.802
[Cheryl] Vegan?

07:16.803 --> 07:18.172
We have a special
mission today.

07:18.172 --> 07:20.973
Oh, come on, boss.
It's Saturday.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.244
I've got
my half-sister's baby shower.

07:23.343 --> 07:25.812
We're going to Poison Ivy
and Kite Man's wedding.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.680
Ivy's going
through with it, huh?

07:27.781 --> 07:29.783
You mean Kite Man's
going through with it?

07:29.882 --> 07:31.752
After all that
woman's done to him.

07:31.851 --> 07:33.987
Look, we don't know
the emotional underpinnings

07:33.987 --> 07:35.245
of that relationship

07:35.245 --> 07:37.990
but by God we will when
we arrest those two lovebirds

07:37.990 --> 07:40.627
along with every major
supervillain in the city

07:40.726 --> 07:42.795
who didn't have
prior weekend plans.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.730
Sounds like Batman's problem.

07:44.831 --> 07:48.235
Well, I am off to my
half-sister's baby shower.

07:48.334 --> 07:50.036
[Gordon] Not so fast, Cheryl.

07:50.036 --> 07:52.538
Aren't you tired of the supers
getting all the credit?

07:52.639 --> 07:53.874
Here. Here's the guest list.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.076
-Take one. Pass 'em along.
-[mumbles]

07:56.175 --> 07:58.511
These are the most powerful
supervillains in Gotham.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.047
Exactly. It's pretty badass.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.814
Pretty damn key worthy.

08:01.915 --> 08:04.651
But, sir, these people have
a myriad of superpowers.

08:04.651 --> 08:05.985
And what do we have?

08:06.086 --> 08:08.636
A damn good plan.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.975
Oh, Father,
I gotta sin I've gotta confess.

08:29.076 --> 08:30.877
Ah, this isn't really
a good time, son.

08:30.978 --> 08:32.611
Yeah, uh, I must confess.

08:32.711 --> 08:34.847
All righty then,
what is it, my son?

08:34.947 --> 08:38.398
I punched out a priest.

08:44.158 --> 08:46.707
[muffled screams]

08:50.764 --> 08:52.932
Look at you!
Looking all elegant and shit.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.033
You come alone?

08:54.701 --> 08:55.701
[laughs]

08:55.701 --> 08:57.171
My name is... [grunts]

08:59.340 --> 09:00.874
Can I get an amen?

09:00.974 --> 09:02.009
Amen, sir.

09:04.043 --> 09:07.147
Oh! Oh, now this is majestic.

09:07.246 --> 09:09.316
It is very 2014 Pinterest.

09:09.416 --> 09:12.585
Kite Man is a basic bitch
through and through.

09:12.686 --> 09:15.087
Oh, he's drinking
out of a mason jar.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.224
I am so nervous.

09:17.323 --> 09:20.860
Relax. Weddings
are a joyful occasion.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.895
You know,
unless you're one
of the bridesmaids.

09:22.995 --> 09:24.831
The gifts are okay, I guess.

09:24.931 --> 09:27.000
I'm not nervous
about the wedding.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.336
I'm nervous about
performing at the reception.

09:29.436 --> 09:32.706
This particular piece
is a musical minefield.

09:32.806 --> 09:35.875
The tricky rhythms,
dramatic shifts in pitch.

09:35.975 --> 09:39.812
One needs the lung
capacity of an Adam Lambert.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.081
Aren't you cute?

09:41.181 --> 09:43.850
Look, I'm sure Ivy
will love the song.

09:43.950 --> 09:45.284
I don't care if she loves it.

09:45.385 --> 09:47.620
I only care if he does.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.100
Catwoman's date?

09:49.100 --> 09:50.923
How dare you?
That's not just
Catwoman's date.

09:51.024 --> 09:53.726
That's cinema auteur,
Tim Burton.

09:53.826 --> 09:56.263
If I deliver
a siren song for the ages,

09:56.263 --> 09:58.630
it could be my big break.

09:58.631 --> 10:00.734
So you weren't singing
this song out of love?

10:00.833 --> 10:04.971
-I was, out of love for acting.
-Mmm-hmm. [gasps]

10:05.072 --> 10:06.206
Oh, my gosh! She's here.

10:06.307 --> 10:08.774
Hey, hi, howdy, hello,

10:08.774 --> 10:10.644
everybody continue talking
amongst yourselves.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.011
Everything's cool.

10:12.111 --> 10:14.947
Harley! I'm so glad
you decided to come.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.883
-Love wins again.
-Yeah, yeah.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.318
Long live Poison Kitey.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.153
[chuckles] Well done.
That's one less thing

10:20.153 --> 10:21.455
you'll regret your entire life.

10:21.455 --> 10:22.822
Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally.

10:22.822 --> 10:24.390
So are there other
rooms here or what?

10:24.491 --> 10:27.193
They have us corralled
in here for cocktail hour.

10:27.193 --> 10:29.196
Right under this godforsaken AC

10:29.296 --> 10:31.264
-which is doing nothing...
-Gordon.

10:31.365 --> 10:32.432
...my vocal chords!

10:32.533 --> 10:33.833
I'm gonna go find the bathroom.

10:33.833 --> 10:34.868
[Clayface scatting]

10:34.967 --> 10:36.169
There you are, Gordon.

10:36.269 --> 10:37.971
-There you are.
-Ah! Don't touch me.

10:38.071 --> 10:39.206
[laughs] Let's get you

10:39.206 --> 10:40.274
with the other
bridesmaids, okay?

10:40.274 --> 10:45.144
It's almost showtime.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.880
So how's everyone been?

10:47.880 --> 10:48.914
What the crap, Harley?

10:49.015 --> 10:50.917
I'm here. Ready to maid.

10:52.119 --> 10:53.687
You weren't at the rehearsal.

10:53.687 --> 10:55.087
How are you gonna
know how to walk?

10:55.188 --> 10:56.822
Uh, right foot,
left foot. Repeat.

10:56.923 --> 10:58.192
You bailed on Ivy.

10:58.192 --> 11:00.159
What do you care?
Are you even a bridesmaid?

11:00.159 --> 11:02.962
I still have all
the responsibilities
of a bridesmaid.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.798
Just not the fashion ones.

11:04.798 --> 11:07.033
You think I'd be
caught dead in that rag.

11:07.033 --> 11:08.434
Okay. Well,
then can I wear yours?

11:08.535 --> 11:10.037
[chuckles]

11:10.136 --> 11:13.105
Which ten pounds
do you plan on leaving behind?

11:13.206 --> 11:15.475
Ladies, I'm just
here to support Ivy.

11:15.576 --> 11:17.277
That is the only
reason I'm here.

11:17.378 --> 11:19.278
Please give me the chance
to make it up to her.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.847
And you. Cobb squad forever.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.851
[grunts] Damn!

11:25.951 --> 11:27.754
I thought she was
just being a beep.
This really is too tight.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.822
-[grunting]
-Hold still, goddamn it!

11:29.923 --> 11:32.024
-BRB!
-Hey, I'm not done!

11:32.125 --> 11:34.461
You said you'd
braid my hair! Fuck!

11:34.562 --> 11:37.464
Where are you,
you rat bastard?

11:37.565 --> 11:38.999
What did you just call me?

11:39.099 --> 11:42.001
-Harley?
-Oh, hey, Mr. Groom.

11:42.001 --> 11:43.903
I just wanted to say mazel tov

11:43.903 --> 11:46.139
and I wish you
many happinesses.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.341
I am having so many
emotions right now.

11:48.442 --> 11:50.910
None of them
I would categorize as happy.

11:50.910 --> 11:52.846
[stutters] Hey, where's Frank?
He said if this happened,

11:52.846 --> 11:54.280
he'd have a pocket full
of zannies for me.

11:54.280 --> 11:56.383
There you are,
my runaway bridesmaid.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.351
I'm supposed
to keep you two apart.

11:58.351 --> 11:59.385
Yikes!

12:01.120 --> 12:02.889
Hey, Jen, hair looks great.

12:02.989 --> 12:04.057
No thanks to you.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.225
Yass, queens. Okay, attitude.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.095
Give me attitude.
Great. Love it.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.162
Got you, Gordo!

12:09.263 --> 12:10.397
Ah, fuck my ass.

12:10.496 --> 12:12.831
No one ruins
my best friend's wedding

12:12.932 --> 12:15.436
but me!

12:15.469 --> 12:16.870
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

12:16.970 --> 12:18.438
Mr. Covington,
Help, the venue rep.

12:18.538 --> 12:20.840
He's bleeding. [whimpers]

12:20.941 --> 12:22.442
Hey, where do
I stand for the...

12:22.442 --> 12:24.211
-Tad! [gasps]
-Ivy!

12:24.311 --> 12:26.846
Wow. You look stunning.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.712
-Harley!
-[yelps]

12:30.951 --> 12:32.952
Hey, Tawny,
it's the Commish...

12:33.852 --> 12:34.988
...ioner.

12:35.087 --> 12:36.557
-[Tawny] <i>Commissioner?</i>
-Gordon.

12:36.557 --> 12:38.357
Yes. Listen, I've got
the scoop of the year for you.

12:38.359 --> 12:40.394
Bring your cameras down
to the old Gotham corn factory

12:40.394 --> 12:41.528
because there's gonna be

12:41.629 --> 12:44.163
something real
heroic going down.

12:45.197 --> 12:46.365
[clicks tongue]

12:46.466 --> 12:47.933
You're ruining my wedding.

12:48.033 --> 12:50.003
I'm trying to do
the opposite of that.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.971
I keep finding people
that you've punched out

12:52.072 --> 12:53.974
and then you made
the photographer faint.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.375
-But--
-Look, I just need this day

12:55.475 --> 12:56.809
to go smoothly for Kite Man.

12:56.809 --> 12:58.000
I mean, he's a mess.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.147
I mean, he didn't
even want you here.

13:00.147 --> 13:01.615
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have said that.

13:01.615 --> 13:03.149
It's just... Look,
this is supposed to be

13:03.149 --> 13:05.519
the happiest day
of my life, you know?

13:05.619 --> 13:08.554
I mean, that is if you ascribe
to those patriarchal norms

13:08.655 --> 13:12.057
about a woman's value fading
after she gets chosen by a man.

13:12.057 --> 13:13.393
Which we don't, right?

13:13.494 --> 13:15.428
Regardless,
it's supposed to be,

13:15.528 --> 13:17.897
overall,
a really good vibes day

13:17.898 --> 13:19.566
and it's barely
hanging on by a thread.

13:19.567 --> 13:20.900
I mean, I feel like I'm just

13:21.000 --> 13:22.969
sick of managing
everyone's feelings.

13:23.070 --> 13:25.105
I have my own.

13:25.205 --> 13:28.307
I'm nervous
and I'm scared
about the future, too.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.143
But... I don't get a time

13:30.244 --> 13:32.111
to just like
reflect about that, you know,

13:32.211 --> 13:34.947
before I walk down
the goddamn aisle forever.

13:35.048 --> 13:37.884
No, because someone's
going around cold-cocking

13:37.984 --> 13:40.254
-all my goddamn
vendors. Shit.
-But--

13:40.354 --> 13:42.154
-But Ivy--
-Harley!

13:42.255 --> 13:44.890
Your friendship
means the world to me

13:44.990 --> 13:46.626
but, maybe, I'm kidding myself

13:46.626 --> 13:48.294
that I can have
my cake and eat it too.

13:48.294 --> 13:50.431
You know, you
can't stop being you

13:50.530 --> 13:54.268
and... [sighs]
That fucks up what
I have with Kite Man.

13:54.368 --> 13:55.902
It just does.

13:55.902 --> 13:57.870
Gordon is here
to bust half your guest list.

13:57.971 --> 13:59.273
I'm trying
to save your wedding.

13:59.373 --> 14:01.942
-Listen how crazy you sound.
-I'm not.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.342
-Two-Face told me.
-Okay.

14:03.443 --> 14:06.614
A literal two-faced
person told you that.

14:06.714 --> 14:08.881
Harls, you may not even
know this but you're looking

14:08.881 --> 14:11.350
for any reason to disrupt
my life with Kite Man.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.120
And I just... I cannot have it.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.587
So what are you saying?

14:14.687 --> 14:17.356
I mean, I'm saying... [sighs]

14:17.357 --> 14:18.658
I'm saying I don't
want you to be here.

14:20.427 --> 14:21.427
[sobs]

14:23.697 --> 14:26.099
[Clayface singing]

14:27.701 --> 14:29.602
Harley, are you leaving?

14:29.702 --> 14:32.339
Yeah, I got duped by Two-Face.

14:32.438 --> 14:34.575
He told me Gordon was
gonna be here but he's not.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.576
And I just look
stupid and desperate

14:36.677 --> 14:38.110
in front of everyone as usual.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.212
Nonsense! We're at a wedding.

14:40.214 --> 14:42.115
The only person people
are paying attention to

14:42.115 --> 14:43.650
is the bride... [chuckles]

14:43.750 --> 14:45.552
And hopefully, me!

14:45.653 --> 14:47.654
[scatting]

14:49.590 --> 14:52.592
[sighs] Maybe I don't
fit in Ivy's new life.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.027
[Clayface] Ugh, I need water.

14:57.264 --> 14:58.999
[sniffs]

14:59.099 --> 15:02.201
Plastic?

15:02.235 --> 15:04.303
Ivy, from the first
moment I saw you,

15:04.403 --> 15:06.572
I knew I could never do better.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.442
And even though you rejected me

15:08.442 --> 15:11.177
over and over again
and over again,

15:11.177 --> 15:12.613
for good measure,

15:12.712 --> 15:16.015
I was determined
to share a life with you.

15:16.115 --> 15:18.317
You know, some
might call it stalking...

15:18.418 --> 15:20.721
Ivy, I can't wait to spend

15:20.721 --> 15:22.322
the rest of my life with you

15:22.422 --> 15:26.393
in our modest,
ranch-style, suburban home.

15:26.493 --> 15:29.596
Grilling meatless
proteins, of course,

15:29.697 --> 15:34.067
and spending weekends shuttling
our four kids between soccer,

15:34.167 --> 15:36.302
ballet, karate and capoeira,

15:36.403 --> 15:39.706
which is this sick combination
of ballet and karate.

15:39.807 --> 15:42.207
Spending Sunday dinners
at my parents' house,

15:42.208 --> 15:45.077
as soon as they allow us back
into their lives, of course.

15:45.177 --> 15:48.381
Um, and just a lot
of chilling on the couch,

15:48.481 --> 15:51.051
binging some
premium streaming content

15:51.150 --> 15:53.519
and looking at our phones.
No-judgment style.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.389
Ivy, you are
the wind beneath my kite.

15:56.490 --> 15:58.291
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

15:58.392 --> 16:00.427
Saving my best friend.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.730
Well, that was...
a very specific picture

16:02.730 --> 16:04.697
that you painted
of our future that I had not...

16:04.697 --> 16:07.033
[clears throat] I had
not totally considered.

16:07.768 --> 16:09.101
[sighs]

16:09.201 --> 16:10.403
Oh, right, I'm up. Sorry.

16:10.504 --> 16:13.072
Um, hello,
uh, let me just check

16:13.173 --> 16:15.041
my notes...
Right.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.009
[inhales]

16:17.009 --> 16:17.878
[coughs]

16:17.878 --> 16:20.279
Charles Kite Man Brown,

16:21.313 --> 16:22.783
I...

16:22.883 --> 16:24.350
I knew you were bullshit.

16:24.350 --> 16:26.219
It's not what you think.
Just let me through.

16:26.318 --> 16:27.788
Fuck you, homewrecker.

16:27.788 --> 16:30.389
Time to put my Cardio Barre
membership to the test.

16:30.389 --> 16:31.389
Fuck, Jennifer.

16:31.389 --> 16:33.192
I am 36 goddammit!

16:33.293 --> 16:35.662
This might be the last wedding
I get to be a bridesmaid in.

16:35.763 --> 16:40.167
[shouts]

16:40.200 --> 16:42.503
Why is a caterer
at the ceremony?

16:44.403 --> 16:49.241
-[Harley shouts]
-[grunts]

16:49.275 --> 16:52.613
[in exaggerated accent]
Okay, great. You did your part.
Do you both agree now?

16:52.712 --> 16:53.746
-Hell yeah.
-I do.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.349
I now pronounce you...

16:56.817 --> 16:58.317
[in normal voice]
Under arrest!

16:58.418 --> 17:00.354
Do it, men and Cheryl,

17:00.453 --> 17:01.788
[grunts]

17:01.889 --> 17:03.056
Too much glue.

17:03.155 --> 17:06.125
Why? [crying]

17:07.528 --> 17:08.561
The flowers.

17:08.561 --> 17:09.762
I'll get us out,
I'll get us out.

17:10.396 --> 17:11.431
[groans]

17:12.598 --> 17:15.201
This is... Shit! Plastic?

17:15.201 --> 17:17.538
Why?

17:17.538 --> 17:18.538
Gas masks!

17:18.605 --> 17:20.440
[mumbling]

17:23.576 --> 17:25.311
[Tawny] Merv, Merv,
are you getting this?

17:25.311 --> 17:26.445
'Cause I can't see anything.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.451
Darling, I think
it's time to leave.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.487
Don't leave, Mr. Burton!

17:33.586 --> 17:35.521
We haven't rapped yet.

17:35.622 --> 17:40.622
<i>This is for you,</i>
<i>Timothy Burton!</i>

17:40.794 --> 17:42.328
[singing]

17:45.699 --> 17:49.102
No! Why! No...

17:49.201 --> 17:50.251
[thuds]

17:56.375 --> 17:57.375
[chuckles]

17:58.377 --> 18:00.279
Maid of honor coming through!

18:00.380 --> 18:01.579
[grunts]

18:06.486 --> 18:07.685
[shouts]

18:14.493 --> 18:16.395
Ah! I fucking love science.

18:18.632 --> 18:20.299
Tawny Young reporting live

18:20.299 --> 18:22.869
from the scene
of Ivy and Kite Man's wedding

18:22.970 --> 18:25.171
in which
Police Commissioner Gordon,

18:25.271 --> 18:26.874
-heroically...
-Retreat!

18:26.973 --> 18:28.508
Get outside! Quick!

18:28.509 --> 18:30.277
Pissed off some
very powerful supervillains

18:30.277 --> 18:32.345
and accomplished
absolutely nothing.

18:32.346 --> 18:33.613
All right, Merv,
let's pack it up.

18:33.614 --> 18:34.681
[explodes]

18:35.715 --> 18:38.266
[singing an aria]

18:48.761 --> 18:50.230
Gary, let's get out of here.

18:50.329 --> 18:51.565
That guy is creeping me out.

18:51.664 --> 18:54.515
[singing continues]

19:09.817 --> 19:11.250
Harley, I'm really glad

19:11.250 --> 19:12.819
you didn't leave
when I told you to.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.188
I thought maybe I could
do something right for once.

19:15.288 --> 19:17.523
Oh! I just want you
guys to be happy.

19:17.624 --> 19:18.791
Well, it's too late.

19:18.892 --> 19:20.426
Once again,
everything is ruined.

19:20.527 --> 19:21.929
It doesn't have to be.

19:22.028 --> 19:23.363
Hey, I'm an ordained minister.

19:23.462 --> 19:25.230
I got a license-- Ah-- online.

19:25.332 --> 19:26.666
And I made it into a lanyard.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.501
Pretty legit, huh?
So what do you think, huh?

19:28.602 --> 19:30.569
-Can I marry you?
-Wow! [chuckles]

19:30.671 --> 19:32.305
Harley with a backup plan.

19:32.404 --> 19:34.942
Oh, good for you, Reverend.

19:35.041 --> 19:36.385
Fuck you!

19:36.385 --> 19:38.511
Listen, Kite Man,
I know we aren't
in the corn factory

19:38.612 --> 19:40.380
but we are on the property.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.949
So technically, you can tell
<i>Us Weekly</i> or whatever

19:41.949 --> 19:43.375
that you got married there.

19:43.375 --> 19:44.984
We can Photoshop some
pics later. It'll be great.

19:44.984 --> 19:47.820
-[screams]
-Okay. Let's do this.

19:47.921 --> 19:49.923
-Hell no.
-What?

19:50.023 --> 19:52.925
I should have known
the third time I proposed.

19:52.925 --> 19:54.627
Every step in our relationship

19:54.728 --> 19:57.364
I've had to do over
and over and over.

19:57.463 --> 19:58.999
[stutters] And I'm not.

19:59.099 --> 20:02.669
After all of this,
I'm not redoing my wedding.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.538
Don't you...
Don't you wanna marry me?

20:04.538 --> 20:06.573
Of course, I do. But you don't.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.776
I saw your face during the vows

20:08.875 --> 20:11.411
and I knew
your heart wasn't in it.

20:11.510 --> 20:14.381
I may be simple
but I'm not a fool.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.983
It is hard to finally admit it.

20:17.084 --> 20:19.819
But since you
refuse to, I will.

20:19.920 --> 20:21.354
I'm not the person for you.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.022
No. Oh, shit!

20:23.124 --> 20:25.759
Like you said, Ivy,
I deserve the best.

20:25.858 --> 20:30.058
[Clayface continues singing]

20:34.768 --> 20:35.768
There they are!

20:37.637 --> 20:38.905
Shit! We gotta get out of here.

20:41.741 --> 20:44.892
[singing intensifies]

20:52.019 --> 20:53.219
[grunts]

20:57.457 --> 20:58.724
Where's the exit?

20:58.726 --> 21:00.326
[Poison Ivy]
Oh, for the shit of shit.

21:00.326 --> 21:01.694
This is why I didn't
want to get married here.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.596
The parking lot is a damn maze.

21:05.031 --> 21:06.866
-[tires screeching]
-[sirens wailing]

21:06.967 --> 21:09.435
[Frank] It's pollen season
in here, bitch!

21:09.536 --> 21:11.637
It's pollen season!

21:11.738 --> 21:13.039
I'm really sorry, Ivy.

21:13.039 --> 21:14.775
Kite Man will come around.
He always does.

21:14.875 --> 21:17.711
Yeah, but you know what?
I won't. I mean, he's right.

21:17.810 --> 21:20.513
I've been denying a lot
of myself for a long time.

21:20.614 --> 21:22.782
I guess... I guess,
it seemed easier for me

21:22.883 --> 21:24.451
to just go along
with it, you know?

21:24.550 --> 21:27.054
But now I realize
I hurt a lot of people

21:27.153 --> 21:29.789
-delaying the inevitable.
-Well, people change.

21:29.890 --> 21:32.026
Yeah, yeah, people do change.

21:32.125 --> 21:34.994
I mean, look at you.
What you did for me today.

21:35.095 --> 21:37.663
You... [sighs]
You showed me the Harls

21:37.763 --> 21:39.566
I always wanted
to see, you know.

21:39.665 --> 21:41.801
You don't think
I'm chaotic and crazy,

21:41.902 --> 21:44.070
-make a bunch of messes?
-No, you definitely do that.

21:44.171 --> 21:46.472
But you're trying to grow

21:46.573 --> 21:48.775
and actually doing it.

21:48.875 --> 21:50.576
And that, I mean, for me,

21:50.576 --> 21:51.678
that's what matters.

21:51.678 --> 21:52.913
[sighs] I love you, Ive.

21:55.015 --> 21:56.516
I love you, too, Harls.

21:58.617 --> 21:59.987
Oh... Oh, shit!

22:00.086 --> 22:01.488
Okay, eyes on the road!

22:01.587 --> 22:04.887
I love you, but Jesus!

22:12.932 --> 22:15.333
[sirens wailing]

22:23.676 --> 22:25.679
