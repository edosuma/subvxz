MacGYVER:
When you think about it,

01:26.152 --> 01:29.155
I take on a lot of jobs
nobody else would want.

01:29.155 --> 01:31.658
The question is--
why doIwant 'em?

01:31.658 --> 01:33.159
(bird squawking)

01:33.159 --> 01:37.163
I find myself asking
these questions more and more,

01:37.664 --> 01:40.166
and rationalizing answers
with stuff like flexible hours,

01:40.166 --> 01:43.670
nice scenery,
all-expense paid vacations

01:43.670 --> 01:47.173
in colorful Eastern European
luxury resorts.

01:48.675 --> 01:51.678
But the bottom line is,
I like it.

01:51.678 --> 01:53.680
I actually like
getting into stuff

01:53.680 --> 01:56.182
that makes
the old adrenaline pump.

01:56.182 --> 01:59.686
And I get
to meet some interesting people

01:59.686 --> 02:04.190
who've made some interesting
career choices themselves.

02:04.190 --> 02:05.191
Guten Abend.

02:05.191 --> 02:07.694
Wie gehts?

02:07.694 --> 02:09.696
MacGyver.

02:09.696 --> 02:12.198
Kareem.

02:12.198 --> 02:14.701
Skyhook.

02:14.701 --> 02:16.202
(chuckles)

02:16.202 --> 02:17.704
Ja.

02:17.704 --> 02:19.706
(bird singing)

02:19.706 --> 02:21.207
(laughs)

02:21.207 --> 02:23.209
Fantastischmoves, that one.

02:23.209 --> 02:24.210
Yeah, this one, too.

02:24.210 --> 02:26.212
As soon as
you deliver.

02:26.212 --> 02:28.715
Everything is,

02:28.715 --> 02:31.217
uh, inside.

02:31.217 --> 02:32.719
Thank you.

02:32.719 --> 02:34.220
You've taken
some risks.

02:34.220 --> 02:36.723
So have you, my friend.

02:36.723 --> 02:38.224
Oh, a drink?

02:38.224 --> 02:40.226
Uh, how they say, uh,

02:40.226 --> 02:41.728
one for the road?

02:41.728 --> 02:43.229
No, thanks.

02:43.229 --> 02:44.731
It's not that
far, is it?

02:44.731 --> 02:46.232
Hmm? No.

02:46.232 --> 02:49.235
The border is only, uh,
12 kilometers.

02:49.235 --> 02:50.737
MAN:
Halt!

02:50.737 --> 02:51.738

men speaking German)

02:56.242 --> 02:57.243

02:57.243 --> 02:58.244
No, Herr MacGyver.

02:58.244 --> 03:00.246
Do not move!

03:00.747 --> 03:03.750

03:03.750 --> 03:05.251

03:05.251 --> 03:06.753

(man shouting and groaning)

04:24.831 --> 04:26.833
(tires squealing)

04:30.837 --> 04:32.338
Waiting for a bus?

04:32.338 --> 04:32.839
Bannister?

04:32.839 --> 04:34.340
(men yelling)

04:34.340 --> 04:35.842
What the heck?

04:35.842 --> 04:37.343
(yelling in German)

04:38.344 --> 04:39.846
Where'd you
come from?

04:39.846 --> 04:41.848
(tires squealing)

04:48.354 --> 04:50.356
New Director of Operations
sent me in. Backup.

04:50.356 --> 04:51.357
NewDirector?

04:51.858 --> 04:52.859
Oh, you're
gonna love him.

04:52.859 --> 04:54.360
Can hardly wait.

04:54.360 --> 04:55.862
(laughs)

04:55.862 --> 04:56.863
Hey!

04:56.863 --> 05:00.366
(speaking German)

05:01.367 --> 05:02.368
We're now 90% home!

05:02.368 --> 05:03.369
(tires squealing)

05:03.369 --> 05:04.871
Just down this hill,

05:04.871 --> 05:06.372
and a couple of
kilometers due west.

05:06.372 --> 05:09.876
(man yelling)

05:13.379 --> 05:15.381
(tires screeching)

05:23.389 --> 05:25.391
Brakes seem
to be fading.

05:25.391 --> 05:27.393
(tires squealing)

05:29.395 --> 05:31.397
Got a problem.
Correction:
nonexistent!

05:31.397 --> 05:32.899
(tires squealing)

05:38.404 --> 05:40.406
(man shouting in German)

05:40.406 --> 05:42.408
(tires screeching)

05:44.911 --> 05:46.412
(tires screeching)

05:46.913 --> 05:48.414
Yeah, we're goin' to
the border, all right,

05:48.915 --> 05:50.416
in pieces.

05:50.416 --> 05:51.918
This is an emergency.

05:51.918 --> 05:52.418
Nothin'!

05:53.920 --> 05:55.421
I think we're out of fluid, Mac.

05:55.421 --> 05:57.423
(tires squealing)

05:57.423 --> 05:59.926
Sorry, pal.

05:59.926 --> 06:00.927
Some backup, huh?

06:00.927 --> 06:02.929
No, no, no, no,
there's got to be a way.

06:02.929 --> 06:04.931
What're you talkin' about?
There's got
to be a way

06:04.931 --> 06:05.932
to stop this thing.

06:05.932 --> 06:06.933
Without brakes?
Oh, yeah.

06:06.933 --> 06:07.934
Withbrakes!

06:07.934 --> 06:09.435
Come again?

06:09.435 --> 06:10.937
(tires squealing)

06:14.440 --> 06:15.441
Pop the hood.

06:15.441 --> 06:16.442
What?

06:16.442 --> 06:17.443
Just pop it.

06:24.951 --> 06:26.953
(man shouting in German)

06:26.953 --> 06:28.454
What the hell
are you doin'?

06:28.454 --> 06:29.956
Well, there's still got
to be some fluid

06:29.956 --> 06:31.457
in the power steering, right?

06:31.457 --> 06:33.459
Maybe I can pump it
into the brake cylinder.

06:33.459 --> 06:35.962
Sure that'll work?

06:35.962 --> 06:37.964
No.

06:38.965 --> 06:40.967
(tires squealing)

07:04.490 --> 07:07.493
(tires screeching)

07:20.006 --> 07:23.509
(tires screeching loudly)

07:23.509 --> 07:26.012
How far are we from the border?

07:26.012 --> 07:27.513
Bottom of the hill.

07:27.513 --> 07:29.015
Three kilometers.

07:29.015 --> 07:31.517
(tires screeching)

07:40.026 --> 07:41.027
(tires screeching)

07:41.027 --> 07:43.529
(guards yelling in German)

07:47.033 --> 07:50.036
(man yelling in German)

07:52.538 --> 07:55.541
(speaking German)

08:08.554 --> 08:11.057
(tires screeching)

08:13.559 --> 08:15.561
(tires screeching)

08:15.561 --> 08:17.563
All right, pump the brake.

08:17.563 --> 08:19.565
Pump the brakes!

08:19.565 --> 08:21.067
(quiet squeal and crunch)

08:21.067 --> 08:22.068
Mac,

08:22.068 --> 08:24.070
my boy,

08:24.070 --> 08:26.572
I think you did it!

08:26.572 --> 08:29.075
We got brakes!

08:31.077 --> 08:32.578
(tires screeching)

08:32.578 --> 08:34.580
Piece of cake!

08:36.082 --> 08:38.083
Ah.

08:38.083 --> 08:39.585
There you are.

08:39.585 --> 08:42.587
Ever think about
making a living as
a hood ornament?

08:45.091 --> 08:47.093
So, how's the wife?

08:47.093 --> 08:48.594
(laughs)

08:48.594 --> 08:50.596
She's fine.

08:50.596 --> 08:52.598
Just fine.

08:53.599 --> 08:55.601
(tires squealing)

09:03.609 --> 09:05.611
(indistinct crowd chatter)

09:05.611 --> 09:08.614
WOMAN:
I'll see you later.

09:12.618 --> 09:14.620
Fine.

09:16.122 --> 09:17.623
Morning, Mr. MacGyver.

09:17.623 --> 09:18.624
Fritz.
Good trip?

09:19.125 --> 09:21.127
Yeah, it was kind
of a rest cure.

09:21.127 --> 09:23.129
I brought you somethin',

09:23.129 --> 09:25.131
special delivery.

09:32.138 --> 09:33.639
Lieber Gott!

09:33.639 --> 09:36.142
There's a letter
in there, too, for you.

09:39.145 --> 09:42.148
You-You saw my sister?

09:42.148 --> 09:43.149
Yeah, she's fine, Fritz.

09:43.149 --> 09:44.150
So are the kids.

09:44.150 --> 09:45.651
You can tell
by the pictures there.

09:47.653 --> 09:49.655
But... how?

09:49.655 --> 09:53.159
Well, I was just passin'
through East Berlin, and...

10:00.166 --> 10:01.667
Mr. MacGyver...

10:03.169 --> 10:04.670
thank you.

10:10.176 --> 10:12.678
(low, indistinct chatter)

10:12.678 --> 10:14.680
(elevator bell dings)

10:27.193 --> 10:28.194
Oops!

10:28.194 --> 10:29.695
Oh, hi, Mac.

10:29.695 --> 10:32.198
Why don't I meet you
down the hall, huh?

10:32.198 --> 10:33.699
Eh, no, no, you
don't understand.

10:33.699 --> 10:35.201
This is Ingrid.

10:35.201 --> 10:37.703
Well, I certainly hope so.

10:37.703 --> 10:38.704
Ingrid, this
is MacGyver,

10:38.704 --> 10:40.206
the fellow I was
telling you about.

10:40.206 --> 10:42.208
He, uh,
fixes brakes.

10:42.208 --> 10:43.709
How do you do, Mrs. Bannister?

10:43.709 --> 10:46.712
Not well, if you intend
to take him away from me again.

10:46.712 --> 10:49.215
I'm sorry about that, but,

10:49.215 --> 10:50.716
well, he's under contract.

10:50.716 --> 10:52.718
I'm only part-time here.

10:52.718 --> 10:54.220
We were barely home
from our honeymoon,

10:54.220 --> 10:55.721
and they took him away
for a whole month.

10:55.721 --> 10:57.223
Yeah, I remember.

10:57.223 --> 10:58.224
And now he's back.

10:58.224 --> 11:00.226
I've hardly had time
to say hello,

11:00.226 --> 11:03.229
and already your new director's
asking for him again.

11:03.229 --> 11:06.732
Listen, why don't I see
if I can stall him a bit?

11:06.732 --> 11:08.234
What'd I tell you
about MacGyver?
(laughs)

11:08.234 --> 11:10.736
Why don't you two get back
to what you're doin'?

11:10.736 --> 11:12.238
(laughter)

11:12.238 --> 11:13.239
(cooing)

11:17.743 --> 11:18.744
THORNTON:
Send him in.

11:18.744 --> 11:20.246
WOMAN:
He's on his way, sir.

11:20.246 --> 11:22.748
(knock at door)

11:22.748 --> 11:24.750
Well, I'll be dipped!

11:24.750 --> 11:25.751
(laughing)

11:26.252 --> 11:27.753
The new Executive Director!

11:28.254 --> 11:29.255
Peter, congratulations!

11:29.255 --> 11:31.257
They couldn't have made
a better decision.

11:31.257 --> 11:33.259
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

11:33.259 --> 11:34.260
On the other hand,

11:34.260 --> 11:36.262
maybe condolences would
be more appropriate.

11:36.262 --> 11:37.763
I heard they were
waiting for you.

11:37.763 --> 11:39.265
Oh, yeah, yeah.

11:39.265 --> 11:40.766
Well, you know, I made it.

11:40.766 --> 11:42.268
Thanks to Craig Bannister,
actually.

11:42.268 --> 11:43.269
I owe you for that.

11:43.269 --> 11:44.770
Well, I sent him

11:44.770 --> 11:46.272
because I was
sweating for you.

11:46.272 --> 11:47.273
Why?

11:47.273 --> 11:48.274
Sit down.

11:48.774 --> 11:49.775
I didn't know this

11:49.775 --> 11:52.278
until they gave
me this job,

11:52.278 --> 11:54.780
but we have lost
four top agents

11:54.780 --> 11:56.282
in the past
seven weeks.

11:56.282 --> 11:57.783
Four.

11:57.783 --> 11:59.285
Somebody out there
knows exactly

11:59.285 --> 12:00.786
what we're
going to do

12:00.786 --> 12:01.787
before we
do it, so...

12:01.787 --> 12:03.289
No!

12:03.289 --> 12:04.790
What?

12:04.790 --> 12:05.791
No.

12:05.791 --> 12:07.793
Mac, you'll be working
with Bannister.

12:07.793 --> 12:08.794
I don't care.

12:08.794 --> 12:10.296
The answer's still no.

12:10.296 --> 12:11.297
I just found myself
a great new house

12:11.797 --> 12:12.798
down on the beach,

12:12.798 --> 12:14.300
and I'm in the middle
of movin' in.

12:14.300 --> 12:16.302
Mac, nobody knows
better than I do

12:16.302 --> 12:19.305
that you have really earned
some serious R and R, but...

12:19.305 --> 12:21.307
Boy, am I glad you said that.

12:21.307 --> 12:23.809
Pete, you're gonna be
the best darned director

12:23.809 --> 12:25.311
this place ever had.

12:25.311 --> 12:27.313
And as soon as I'm settled in,

12:27.313 --> 12:29.815
I'm gonna have a barbecue
in your honor.

12:29.815 --> 12:30.816
Mac, this is...

12:30.816 --> 12:32.318
(door closes)

12:32.318 --> 12:33.319
(sighs)

12:33.319 --> 12:34.820
...important.

12:34.820 --> 12:37.323
THORNTON:
Mac, you got to hear me out!

12:37.323 --> 12:39.825
Will you just,
for one single second,

12:39.825 --> 12:41.827
stop and listen to
what I'm saying?

12:41.827 --> 12:44.330
Pete, got any use
for an old truss?

12:44.330 --> 12:45.831
(sighs)

12:46.332 --> 12:47.333
Nice.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.335
Listen, I thought
we could rely
on each other.

12:49.335 --> 12:50.336
I thought we
were friends.

12:51.337 --> 12:53.839
Are friends, Pete,
were friends,

12:53.839 --> 12:56.342
shall be evermore,
aftermy vacation.

12:56.342 --> 12:57.843
Let me spell it out to you.

12:58.344 --> 13:00.846
V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N.

13:00.846 --> 13:01.847
Psss...

13:01.847 --> 13:02.848
Yeah, but you're not

13:02.848 --> 13:03.849
on vacation, are you?

13:03.849 --> 13:05.351
You're working.
Look at you.

13:05.351 --> 13:06.852
You're working
your tail off.

13:06.852 --> 13:10.356
Getting ready to move to
some crummy seaside shack.

13:10.356 --> 13:11.357
Shack?!

13:11.357 --> 13:13.359
Pete, you have no taste.

13:13.359 --> 13:14.860
(sighs)

13:14.860 --> 13:15.861
None.

13:15.861 --> 13:17.863
Mac, for the
love of heaven,

13:17.863 --> 13:19.365
give me a break, will you?

13:19.365 --> 13:21.367
This is serious!

13:21.367 --> 13:24.370
Look, I've come up with a plan.

13:24.370 --> 13:26.372
It's a little risky, but...

13:26.372 --> 13:28.874
I think that we can set a trap
and catch this mole.

13:28.874 --> 13:30.376
Good traps
have good bait.

13:30.376 --> 13:32.378
Well, we've got good bait.

13:32.378 --> 13:34.880
A Russian defector
who worked in the G.R.U.

13:35.381 --> 13:38.884
and can I.D. most of the key
Russian agents by sight.

13:38.884 --> 13:40.386
Well, there
you go, Pete.

13:40.386 --> 13:42.388
You don't need me.

13:42.388 --> 13:44.390
Yeah, well,
a defector is still a defector.

13:44.390 --> 13:47.393
What if ours turns out
to be a double agent, a plant?

13:47.393 --> 13:50.896
Mac, I need someone I can trust
to stay on top of it.

13:50.896 --> 13:52.898
You have got a whole
file full of people

13:52.898 --> 13:55.401
onsalarywho
can do that.

13:55.401 --> 13:58.904
Yes, and any one of them
could turn out to be the mole.

13:59.905 --> 14:03.909
Mac, I need someone
that I know is clean.

14:03.909 --> 14:06.412
Look, you're talking
to a brand new

14:06.412 --> 14:08.914
and very nervous
Director of Operations.

14:08.914 --> 14:10.916
We've lost four
very good agents.

14:11.417 --> 14:13.919
And a key piece
of our national security

14:13.919 --> 14:16.922
is starting to look
like Swiss-damn-cheese.

14:16.922 --> 14:18.424
Now come on!

14:18.424 --> 14:19.925
WOMAN:
Mr. Thornton,

14:19.925 --> 14:21.927
you're wasting your time
and mine,

14:21.927 --> 14:23.929
and I have no interest

14:23.929 --> 14:25.431
to work with someone
who has to be begged

14:25.431 --> 14:26.932
to do his duty.

14:26.932 --> 14:28.934
Viktoria, I told you to wait.

14:28.934 --> 14:30.936
I know what you told me,

14:30.936 --> 14:33.439
and I am tired
of waiting in the car.

14:35.941 --> 14:37.943
This is your defector?

14:37.943 --> 14:40.946
(sighs):
Right.

14:40.946 --> 14:43.949
Viktoria Tomanova,
meet MacGyver.

14:46.952 --> 14:49.455
Mr. Thornton...

14:49.455 --> 14:51.457
you absolutely cannot do this.

14:51.457 --> 14:53.459
You're turning this woman
into a human target.

14:53.459 --> 14:55.461
Mac, I don't have a choice.

14:55.461 --> 14:57.963
I think that is my choice,
Mr. MacGyver,

14:57.963 --> 14:58.964
and I have made it.

14:58.964 --> 15:01.467
My mother still would be
in Soviet Gulag

15:01.467 --> 15:04.970
if it hadn't been for a man
like Mr. Thornton.

15:04.970 --> 15:07.473
I owe a debt, Mr. MacGyver...

15:07.473 --> 15:09.475
and I intend to pay.

15:11.477 --> 15:12.978
Pete...

15:12.978 --> 15:14.980
Excuse me, will you?

15:18.984 --> 15:20.986
Now, I've done
things for you,

15:20.986 --> 15:23.489
and I'm more than
willing to do more,

15:23.489 --> 15:26.492
but risking this woman's
life is not one of them.

15:26.492 --> 15:28.994
This is useless
to talk to thisbolvin.

15:28.994 --> 15:30.496
Let us go.

15:30.496 --> 15:32.498
THORNTON (sighing):
Okay.

15:33.999 --> 15:37.503
All right,
but, uh, Mac,

15:37.503 --> 15:39.505
uh, could you do me
one small favor then?

15:39.505 --> 15:41.507
What?
There's a, uh,
reception tomorrow.

15:41.507 --> 15:43.509
Oh, Pete...
I-I know you
don't like parties,

15:43.509 --> 15:45.511
but this one
is, uh, major.

15:45.511 --> 15:48.514
It's an International Peace
Through Science Symposium,

15:48.514 --> 15:51.517
and, uh, there's going
to be a huge Soviet
delegation there.

15:51.517 --> 15:53.519
Now, Headquarters
wants everyone

15:53.519 --> 15:57.022
from our side
to be present.

15:57.022 --> 15:59.525
Could you just
do that for me?

15:59.525 --> 16:02.528
It's important.

16:05.030 --> 16:07.533
I'll give it some thought.

16:07.533 --> 16:09.034
You will?

16:10.536 --> 16:13.038
Okay.

16:13.038 --> 16:15.541
Thanks.

16:18.043 --> 16:20.546
(muttering under breath)

16:20.546 --> 16:24.550
John Wayne would not
have been afraid.

16:32.057 --> 16:35.561
Bolvin?

16:43.569 --> 16:46.572
(piano playing jazzy tune)

16:55.581 --> 16:58.083
ROBOT:
Welcome to the Peace
Through Science Symposium.

16:58.083 --> 17:01.587
I do hope you enjoy yourself
this evening.

17:02.588 --> 17:05.089
May I offer you
some champagne?

17:06.090 --> 17:07.092
Thank you.

17:07.593 --> 17:09.094
You're quite
welcome, sir.

17:15.601 --> 17:18.103
(indistinct voices)

17:21.106 --> 17:22.608
Good evening.

17:22.608 --> 17:24.108
Good evening, Robert.

17:24.609 --> 17:26.111
Be right with you.

17:26.111 --> 17:28.113
Champagne, sir?

17:28.113 --> 17:30.616
Don't mind if I do.

17:33.118 --> 17:34.620
Good clarity.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.622
Nice legs.

17:36.622 --> 17:38.624
Good bouquet.

17:38.624 --> 17:41.126
Go with a nice fish.

17:42.127 --> 17:45.130
You're losing weight, Robert.

17:48.133 --> 17:50.135
What is it?

17:52.137 --> 17:53.138
Thanks.

17:53.639 --> 17:56.141
Uh-uh. No, no,
no, no...
Oh, stop it.

17:56.141 --> 17:58.644
Don't say a word.
I don't believe it.

17:58.644 --> 18:01.146
Will either of you please
tell me what is so amazing?

18:01.647 --> 18:02.648
MacGyver.

18:02.648 --> 18:04.650
I mean, this man's
idea of black tie

18:04.650 --> 18:06.151
is a dirty shoelace.

18:06.151 --> 18:08.153
Definitely not
into formality.

18:08.153 --> 18:10.656
Then the answer is simple:
a woman.

18:10.656 --> 18:13.659
No, the answer
is Pete put the arm on me.

18:13.659 --> 18:16.161
Ah, must've taken
a whole lot of
drugs and torture.

18:16.161 --> 18:17.162
Will you stop it?

18:17.162 --> 18:20.165
Ignore him, MacGyver.
You're beautiful.

18:20.165 --> 18:22.668
Thank you.
I needed that.

18:22.668 --> 18:24.670
So, where is the boy,
anyway?

18:24.670 --> 18:26.672
Well, he said
he was going to
be a little late.

18:26.672 --> 18:29.174
Yeah.

18:29.174 --> 18:31.176
He may be late,
but he sure knows

18:31.176 --> 18:32.678
how to make
an entrance.

18:32.678 --> 18:35.180
Well, well, well...

18:39.184 --> 18:42.187
Why is everyone
looking at me?

18:42.187 --> 18:46.692
Well... maybe
because you're beautiful.

18:46.692 --> 18:49.194
You're so gallant
and nice.

18:49.194 --> 18:51.196
INGRID:
Who is she?

18:51.196 --> 18:53.198
Oh, society,

18:53.198 --> 18:56.702
old money, that sort
of thing, you know.

18:58.203 --> 19:00.706
I don't know how
Pete finds 'em.

19:00.706 --> 19:02.207
I'm ready.

19:02.207 --> 19:05.210
Then let's circulate.

19:06.712 --> 19:09.214
Yeah.
Mike, Barry,
how you boys doing?

19:09.214 --> 19:10.215
What's this?

19:10.215 --> 19:12.718
Not word one.

19:12.718 --> 19:14.219
It's rented.

19:14.219 --> 19:16.221
You company guys
are all alike.

19:16.221 --> 19:18.223
(laughs)

19:22.227 --> 19:24.229
Thanks for coming.

19:27.733 --> 19:29.234
Oh, yes...

19:29.234 --> 19:30.736
ultra-high-pitched sound.

19:30.736 --> 19:31.737
It's, uh, used

19:31.737 --> 19:33.238
for cleaning jewels

19:33.238 --> 19:36.241
and coins
or the family silver.

19:36.241 --> 19:38.744
Does everything in America
have to do with money?

19:38.744 --> 19:41.747
Well, actually,
it's, uh, also
being developed

19:41.747 --> 19:43.749
for use in mining
and excavation

19:43.749 --> 19:47.753
without pollution
or lung damage.

19:48.754 --> 19:50.255
I'm sorry.

19:50.255 --> 19:52.758
No, it's a
fair question.

19:54.259 --> 19:57.262
Did you finish packing,
Mr. MacGyver?

19:57.262 --> 20:00.265
Actually, it defeated
me completely.

20:00.265 --> 20:02.768
You must learn
not to be defeated

20:02.768 --> 20:05.771
so easily, Mr. MacGyver.

20:05.771 --> 20:09.274
And now, if you will
excuse us...

20:20.786 --> 20:22.788
Who is it?

20:22.788 --> 20:26.291
His name is Anton
Vissarionovich Lem.

20:26.291 --> 20:29.795
G.R.U., Special Operations.

20:30.295 --> 20:31.296
Which means...?

20:31.296 --> 20:32.798
He kills people.

20:33.799 --> 20:35.801
Lem, huh?

20:35.801 --> 20:39.304
Here as part of a delegation
to a Peace Symposium.

20:39.304 --> 20:41.807
Wonderful. Wonderful.

20:44.810 --> 20:46.311
Maybe we should get you
out of here.

20:46.311 --> 20:47.312
What do you say, hmm?

20:47.312 --> 20:49.314
Please, keep your hands
from me.

20:50.315 --> 20:52.818
Pete, you want
to help me on this?

20:52.818 --> 20:54.820
Uh, I think he's right,
if you don't mind, Viktoria.

20:54.820 --> 20:57.823
I'm in no danger.
He doesn't know me.

20:57.823 --> 21:02.327
I only know him from his file.
I was in Records.

21:02.327 --> 21:03.328
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,

21:03.328 --> 21:05.330
may I have
your attention, please?

21:05.330 --> 21:07.332
Thank you.

21:07.332 --> 21:10.836
My dear friends,
I welcome you this evening,

21:10.836 --> 21:14.840
and... may God bless you.

21:14.840 --> 21:17.342
On behalf
of the Committee

21:17.342 --> 21:21.847
for Peace and Progress
Through Technology...

21:21.847 --> 21:23.849
(feedback blaring)
(chuckles)

21:23.849 --> 21:25.350
Uh...

21:25.350 --> 21:27.853
progress,
but not perfection, huh?

21:27.853 --> 21:29.354
(laughter)

21:29.354 --> 21:32.357
Da.
Okay, on a more, uh,
serious note here,

21:32.357 --> 21:34.359
in the hope...

21:34.359 --> 21:37.863
that faith and science

21:37.863 --> 21:40.365
can unite for peace,

21:40.365 --> 21:44.369
let us take a moment
to bless this dream...

21:46.371 --> 21:48.373
(shrill electronic buzzing)

21:52.377 --> 21:54.379
(laughs):
This dream...

21:54.379 --> 21:57.382
that...

21:58.383 --> 21:59.384
...must...

21:59.384 --> 22:00.385
(clears throat)

22:01.386 --> 22:04.389
...unite this divided planet

22:04.890 --> 22:08.393
and re...
excuse me.

22:08.393 --> 22:13.398
Remember we are the animal
that dreams...

22:13.398 --> 22:15.901
a dream which we...

22:15.901 --> 22:18.904
all share...

22:18.904 --> 22:21.406
which we must protect

22:21.406 --> 22:22.908
and defend.

22:22.908 --> 22:24.910
(crowd screaming)

22:24.910 --> 22:26.411
Get her down!

22:30.916 --> 22:35.420
(gunshots, clamoring voices)

22:41.426 --> 22:42.928
(shouting)

22:50.936 --> 22:52.437
Let me get these.
What are you doing?

22:52.437 --> 22:53.438
The glasses...

22:58.443 --> 23:00.946
Tony?

23:00.946 --> 23:04.449
Okay. Jeff?

23:04.449 --> 23:05.450
What is
it, drugs?
Which must unite...

23:05.450 --> 23:07.452
I don't know.
Something hit him.
That's for sure.

23:07.452 --> 23:08.453
...this divided...
Reverend?

23:08.453 --> 23:09.454
Just tell 'em to move aside.

23:09.454 --> 23:10.956
Everyone listen, please.

23:10.956 --> 23:13.458
We want you to clear the room,
but don't leave the building.

23:13.458 --> 23:14.459
We may have some questions.

23:14.459 --> 23:15.961
Reverend?
(mutters)

23:15.961 --> 23:18.964
You just tried
to kill someone. Why?

23:18.964 --> 23:20.966
Animal that...

23:20.966 --> 23:22.467
drinks...
Re...?

23:22.968 --> 23:24.469
that must defend...

23:24.970 --> 23:26.972
and... protect...
That's it.

23:26.972 --> 23:28.974
Someone told you
to use the gun. Who?

23:31.977 --> 23:37.983
They-they... they told... me...

23:37.983 --> 23:40.986
"They". Who's "they", Reverend?

23:43.488 --> 23:45.490
(groaning)

23:46.491 --> 23:47.993
What is it?

23:47.993 --> 23:49.494
There's got to be a
doctor here somewhere.

23:49.995 --> 23:51.997
(groaning)

23:53.999 --> 23:56.001
He's having a heart attack.
Let's go.

23:59.504 --> 24:03.008
(indistinct voices)

24:26.531 --> 24:28.533
(sighs)

24:32.537 --> 24:34.539
He's dead.

24:44.082 --> 24:47.586
(humming)

24:53.592 --> 24:55.093
Hey, hey, hey!

24:55.093 --> 24:56.094
Left inferior artery.

24:56.094 --> 24:57.596
Righty-o.

24:57.596 --> 25:00.098
Blockage of
left inferior
artery, as well.

25:00.098 --> 25:02.100
Arterial embolism
thereby indicated

25:02.100 --> 25:04.102
as cause of
cardiac arrest.

25:04.102 --> 25:07.606
? And away he went. ?

25:07.606 --> 25:09.608
You have to make jokes?

25:09.608 --> 25:11.109
What do you expect?

25:11.109 --> 25:12.110
Tap dance?

25:12.110 --> 25:15.614
Who's your sensitive flower?

25:17.616 --> 25:20.118
Ed, you've been down here
too long.

25:21.620 --> 25:24.122
Craig, there's no need
for you to watch this, you know.

25:24.122 --> 25:25.624
No, Mac.

25:25.624 --> 25:27.125
I can handle it.

25:27.125 --> 25:28.627
Excuse me.

25:32.631 --> 25:33.632
Egg roll.

25:34.132 --> 25:36.134
Want some?

25:37.636 --> 25:39.137
Excuse me.

25:39.137 --> 25:40.639
Okay.

25:40.639 --> 25:42.641
I'll be out in the hall.

25:45.143 --> 25:46.645
Damn civilians!

25:47.145 --> 25:49.648
Ed, you got any idea
on the nature of this thing?

25:50.649 --> 25:52.651
Fatty tissue.

25:52.651 --> 25:54.152
Nature of blockage unknown.

25:54.152 --> 25:56.655
Complex mass
of fibrous tissue.

25:57.155 --> 25:59.157
Analysis to follow.

25:59.157 --> 26:00.158
Can I get a sample?

26:00.158 --> 26:02.160
Be my guest.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.662
Why?

26:03.662 --> 26:05.664
Well, it's not cholesterol,
it's fibrous.

26:05.664 --> 26:07.165
So, what is it?

26:07.165 --> 26:09.668
Oh, I'll probably be able
to tell you that tomorrow.

26:09.668 --> 26:11.169
Unless you're in a rush.

26:11.169 --> 26:12.170
I'm in a rush.

26:12.170 --> 26:14.172
You're always in a rush.

26:14.172 --> 26:15.173
You realize

26:15.173 --> 26:18.677
that this is bending
the regulations just a little?

26:18.677 --> 26:22.681
Ed, who rebuilt
your sound system?

26:22.681 --> 26:24.683
Ah, you have a point.

26:25.183 --> 26:26.685
You also have a sample.

26:26.685 --> 26:27.686
Thank you.

26:27.686 --> 26:29.688
Anytime, MacGyver.

26:31.690 --> 26:32.691
(humming)

26:32.691 --> 26:35.694
Oh, there's some
localized sternal
trauma, too.

26:38.697 --> 26:40.699
BANNISTER:
So, what'd you expect to find?

26:40.699 --> 26:42.701
MacGYVER:
I don't know, but I
hate coincidences.

26:42.701 --> 26:43.702
What coincidence?

26:43.702 --> 26:45.704
The man had a seizure
and dropped dead.

26:45.704 --> 26:47.205
The man was a
psychologically
stable,

26:47.205 --> 26:48.206
highly respected
clergyman

26:48.206 --> 26:49.708
who suddenly
pulls out a
nine millimeter

26:50.208 --> 26:51.209
and starts...

26:51.209 --> 26:52.210
Blasts away.

26:52.210 --> 26:53.712
Six shots

26:53.712 --> 26:56.214
at someone whose identity
is top secret.

26:56.214 --> 26:57.716
Our defector.

26:57.716 --> 26:59.217
Well, was he political?

26:59.217 --> 27:00.719
Reverend Mather?
Yeah.

27:00.719 --> 27:01.720
As far as we can tell,

27:01.720 --> 27:02.721
the last political stand

27:03.221 --> 27:04.723
he took was
against Pontius Pilate.

27:04.723 --> 27:06.725
We checked back
till he was an altar boy,

27:06.725 --> 27:08.226
and he was an altar boy.

27:08.226 --> 27:09.227
The man was clean.

27:09.227 --> 27:10.729
Until he started
shooting,

27:10.729 --> 27:11.730
and then had
the world's

27:11.730 --> 27:13.231
most convenient
heart attack.

27:13.231 --> 27:14.232
Now, wait a minute.

27:14.232 --> 27:16.234
How can you cause a heart attack
on demand?

27:16.234 --> 27:18.236
Do you remember Brudin?

27:18.236 --> 27:20.238
Yeah. Out
of Belgrade?

27:20.238 --> 27:21.740
Yeah, that's the one.

27:21.740 --> 27:24.242
Air bubbles injected
into the arteries.

27:24.242 --> 27:26.745
BANNISTER:
Nobody injected anything
into Reverend Mather.

27:26.745 --> 27:29.247
I mean, he was
up there with 100
people watching.

27:29.247 --> 27:31.249
Yeah, well,
that makes it harder,

27:31.249 --> 27:33.251
but six, two and even,
somebody killed him.

27:33.251 --> 27:35.754
While he was trying
to kill our girl.

27:35.754 --> 27:37.756
Which brings us right to it.

27:37.756 --> 27:39.257
Somebody leaked.

27:39.257 --> 27:41.760
Somebody set her up.

27:41.760 --> 27:43.261
How is she now?

27:43.261 --> 27:44.262
Angry. Scared.

27:44.763 --> 27:45.764
I'm gonna put her
in a safe house

27:45.764 --> 27:47.766
until we get some answers.

27:47.766 --> 27:50.268
She did give us Anton Lem.

27:50.268 --> 27:52.771
How was someone able
to use Mather like that

27:52.771 --> 27:54.773
and then kill him?

27:54.773 --> 27:56.775
I'm workin' on that, guys.

27:56.775 --> 27:58.777
(gulls cawing)

27:58.777 --> 28:00.779
WOMAN:
It was so much fun.

28:00.779 --> 28:03.782
May I come in?

28:03.782 --> 28:04.783
Please.

28:04.783 --> 28:07.786
Thank you.

28:07.786 --> 28:09.788
You haven't finished
packing yet.

28:11.790 --> 28:13.792
I thought Peter Thornton
was gonna tuck you away

28:13.792 --> 28:15.293
in a safe house.

28:15.293 --> 28:17.295
He did, but
I told him

28:17.295 --> 28:19.297
that I would
not be able to
remember anything

28:19.297 --> 28:20.799
unless he
brought me here.

28:20.799 --> 28:23.301
Remind me to thank him.

28:23.301 --> 28:26.805
The last time I was
here, I was very rude.

28:26.805 --> 28:28.807
I came to apologize.

28:28.807 --> 28:30.809
No, no, no,
that's not necessary.

28:30.809 --> 28:32.811
Oh, yes, it is necessary.

28:33.812 --> 28:36.314
You saved my life.

28:36.314 --> 28:40.318
The Chinese say if
someone saves your life,

28:40.819 --> 28:42.821
you're in debt
to them forever.

28:42.821 --> 28:45.323
Strange folk, the Chinese.

28:45.323 --> 28:48.827
They also call their
beautiful children ugly for fear

28:48.827 --> 28:51.329
the gods will punish them
for the sin

28:51.329 --> 28:52.831
of pride.

28:52.831 --> 28:54.332
This is true?

28:54.332 --> 28:56.835
If we were in China,
I'd be obligated

28:56.835 --> 28:59.337
to call you the ugliest woman
in the world.

29:03.842 --> 29:05.844
Are you a chemist?

29:05.844 --> 29:08.346
Chemistry. I dabble.

29:08.346 --> 29:10.348
What is "dabble"?

29:10.348 --> 29:12.350
Well, in this case,
it might just prove

29:12.350 --> 29:15.353
that Reverend Mather
was murdered.

29:15.353 --> 29:18.356
Uh, I thought the heart.

29:18.356 --> 29:19.858
Oh, I understand.

29:22.360 --> 29:25.363
The heart didn't stop.

29:25.363 --> 29:27.866
It was stopped.

29:27.866 --> 29:29.367
But how?

29:29.367 --> 29:31.870
I found adipic acid
in his blood and fatty tissue.

29:33.371 --> 29:35.373
I don't understand.

29:35.373 --> 29:37.375
Um, let me show you.

29:40.378 --> 29:44.883
Adipic acid in a compound
including hexamethyline diamine.

29:56.394 --> 29:57.896
Now, let's see.

29:57.896 --> 29:59.397
(beeps)

29:59.397 --> 30:01.399
Now, the solution also contains
a certain amount

30:01.399 --> 30:02.901
of iron particles.

30:02.901 --> 30:04.402
What I'm gonna do here is

30:04.402 --> 30:06.404
activate a magnetic field,

30:06.404 --> 30:07.405
and...

30:07.405 --> 30:10.408
(whirring and liquid sizzling)

30:15.413 --> 30:17.916
...turn the chemicals
into nylon.

30:17.916 --> 30:19.417
Good for
ladies' stockings and,

30:19.417 --> 30:20.919
uh,

30:20.919 --> 30:23.922
clogging the arteries
of a kind old man.

30:23.922 --> 30:25.423
Of course.

30:25.423 --> 30:27.425
He was a weapon that failed.

30:27.926 --> 30:29.928
And he was eliminated.

30:29.928 --> 30:32.931
Viktoria, this guy Lem...

30:32.931 --> 30:34.432
Of course.

30:34.432 --> 30:37.936
That is what he does-- kills.

30:37.936 --> 30:40.939
MacGyver,

30:40.939 --> 30:43.441
Lem we know,

30:43.441 --> 30:45.443
but there may be others.

30:45.443 --> 30:46.945
Any idea who?

30:46.945 --> 30:48.446
No.

30:48.446 --> 30:49.948
I just have a feeling.

30:49.948 --> 30:51.950
I said before,

30:51.950 --> 30:54.452
I'm not afraid.

30:54.452 --> 30:55.453
I lied.

31:00.458 --> 31:02.961
INGRID:
Was it that terrible
a day, dear?

31:02.961 --> 31:03.962
BANNISTER:
I've had better.

31:03.962 --> 31:05.964
INGRID:
Because of
that crazy man?

31:05.964 --> 31:06.965
Mather?

31:06.965 --> 31:08.466
I don't have a lot of sympathy

31:08.466 --> 31:09.968
for a man
who could have killed you.

31:09.968 --> 31:11.970
Well, MacGyver thinks

31:11.970 --> 31:13.972
he was used, set up.

31:13.972 --> 31:14.973
And then killed.

31:14.973 --> 31:16.474
He had a
heart attack.

31:16.474 --> 31:19.477
Well, Mac thinks
it was induced.

31:19.477 --> 31:20.979
No kidding? How?

31:20.979 --> 31:22.480
I don't know.

31:22.480 --> 31:24.482
He's workin' on it.

31:26.484 --> 31:29.487
MacGyver is a
remarkable guy.

31:29.487 --> 31:31.489
You're lucky to have
him as a friend.

31:31.489 --> 31:34.492
Hmm. Yeah.

31:34.492 --> 31:37.495
I'm even luckier
to have you as a wife.

31:39.998 --> 31:42.500
Are you changing
the subject?

31:42.500 --> 31:44.502
Mm-hmm.

31:47.505 --> 31:49.507
I thought you
had a hard day.

31:49.507 --> 31:55.513
I did, so I need a lot
of comforting, loving care.

31:55.513 --> 31:57.015
All right,
turn over.

31:57.015 --> 32:00.018
Ah! Ah.

32:00.018 --> 32:02.020
(contented sigh)

32:02.020 --> 32:04.522
(clears throat)

32:04.522 --> 32:08.026
Oh, you're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

32:08.026 --> 32:09.027
You know that?

32:09.027 --> 32:11.529
All that time
I was in Europe,

32:11.529 --> 32:14.032
I kept remembering
our honeymoon.

32:14.032 --> 32:17.035
Mmm.

32:17.035 --> 32:20.038
Like a dream.

32:20.038 --> 32:22.540
You were all
I could think about.

32:22.540 --> 32:24.542
It's not a dream, sweetheart.

32:26.544 --> 32:28.046
Not a dream at all.

32:28.046 --> 32:30.548
Not between us.
(electronic humming)

32:39.557 --> 32:41.559
I love you, honey.

32:43.061 --> 32:45.063
I know you do, Craig.

32:45.063 --> 32:48.066
And it was such a
special honeymoon,

32:48.066 --> 32:51.569
teaching you to trust
me, believe me,

32:51.569 --> 32:53.571
in everything,

32:53.571 --> 32:56.074
and you do.

32:56.074 --> 32:58.576
That's why

32:58.576 --> 33:01.579
I want you to tell me exactly

33:01.579 --> 33:06.584
who MacGyver suspects
of killing Reverend Mather.

33:06.584 --> 33:07.585
And how.

33:07.585 --> 33:10.088
You know Mac.

33:10.088 --> 33:12.590
He can't let a puzzle alone.

33:14.092 --> 33:15.093
He told me

33:15.093 --> 33:20.098
the Tomanova woman spotted
a G.R.U. hit man

33:20.098 --> 33:21.599
at the reception.

33:21.599 --> 33:23.601
Who?

33:23.601 --> 33:26.104
Name of Lem.

33:26.104 --> 33:28.106
Anton Lem.

33:28.106 --> 33:30.108
We have him
in the files.

33:30.108 --> 33:32.610
If we can figure out

33:33.111 --> 33:35.113
how the Reverend
was taken out...

33:36.114 --> 33:39.617
tie it to Lem...

33:39.617 --> 33:42.120
we have... some key pieces.

33:42.120 --> 33:46.124
But I can tell you
who's behind it all.

33:46.124 --> 33:47.625
Who?

33:47.625 --> 33:48.626
Two people.

33:48.626 --> 33:52.130
Viktoria Tomanova...

33:52.130 --> 33:54.632
and MacGyver.

33:54.632 --> 33:55.633
Mac?

33:55.633 --> 33:57.135
Mm-hmm.

33:57.135 --> 34:00.138
Behind... killing?

34:00.138 --> 34:01.639
It's true.

34:01.639 --> 34:04.642
And Craig?

34:04.642 --> 34:07.645
Yes?

34:07.645 --> 34:10.648
You have to kill them.

34:11.649 --> 34:14.152
Yes.

34:14.152 --> 34:17.155
Yes.

34:17.655 --> 34:19.157
Kill them both.

34:19.657 --> 34:22.159
(phone rings)

34:22.159 --> 34:23.661
This is Lem.

34:23.661 --> 34:25.163
When will you be ready?

34:25.163 --> 34:26.164
Now.

34:26.164 --> 34:28.666
Good. MacGyver just left.

34:29.667 --> 34:31.668
When? Where is he?

34:31.668 --> 34:34.672
He went to the science fair
reception hall.

34:34.672 --> 34:36.674
Good.

34:36.674 --> 34:38.676
And the Tomanova woman?

34:38.676 --> 34:40.178
She is there, too.

34:40.178 --> 34:41.179
Excellent.

34:41.679 --> 34:42.679
So, we move tomorrow?

34:42.679 --> 34:43.681
No, tonight!

34:43.681 --> 34:45.183
But what about Bannister?

34:45.183 --> 34:47.685
He's never been
more ready.

34:47.685 --> 34:49.187
Good.

34:49.187 --> 34:50.688
I'll have
him dressed

34:50.688 --> 34:53.190
in 20 minutes,
and I'll meet you

34:53.190 --> 34:54.692
in front of the
reception hall.

34:54.692 --> 34:57.195
And Lem?

34:57.195 --> 35:00.198
There must be no mistakes
this time.

35:00.198 --> 35:02.700
I want them both!

35:07.705 --> 35:11.209
VIKTORIA:
It was very much like a dream,
MacGyver,

35:11.209 --> 35:14.212
to think that only
the other night

35:14.712 --> 35:17.715
I was here wearing
that beautiful dress,

35:17.715 --> 35:19.217
feeling like a...

35:19.217 --> 35:20.718
Queen.

35:20.718 --> 35:22.220
(laughing):
Yes.

35:22.220 --> 35:23.721
I know it sounds foolish,

35:23.721 --> 35:27.725
but even loyal Party members
have their fantasies.

35:27.725 --> 35:29.727
I think you've
earned yours.

35:29.727 --> 35:32.230
You wish me
to see that film.

35:32.230 --> 35:34.232
It's a tape, actually,
of what happened here.

35:34.232 --> 35:36.234
And hopefully,
howit happened.

35:36.234 --> 35:37.735
MATHER:
Ladies and gentlemen...

35:37.735 --> 35:38.736
Now, just take
a look at this

35:38.736 --> 35:40.738
and tell me if you
recognize anybody

35:40.738 --> 35:41.739
besides Lem,
all right?

35:41.739 --> 35:42.740
VIKTORIA:
All right.

35:42.740 --> 35:44.242
MATHER:
I welcome you

35:44.242 --> 35:45.743
this evening, and...

35:45.743 --> 35:48.746
may God bless you.

35:48.746 --> 35:51.249
On behalf of the Committee

35:51.249 --> 35:54.752
for Peace and Progress
Through Technology...

35:54.752 --> 35:55.753
(high-pitched feedback)

35:55.753 --> 35:58.256
Uh... oh.

35:58.256 --> 36:00.258
What is that?

36:00.258 --> 36:01.759
Did you hear that sound?

36:01.759 --> 36:02.760
MATHER:
Progress,

36:02.760 --> 36:04.762
but not perfection.

36:04.762 --> 36:07.265
(laughing)

36:07.265 --> 36:09.767
I have heard it
somewhere before.

36:11.269 --> 36:14.772
(audio running backwards)

36:14.772 --> 36:17.275
All right, listen
to it again,
and concentrate.

36:17.275 --> 36:19.277
Oh, it's very close.

36:19.277 --> 36:21.279
On behalf of the Committee

36:21.279 --> 36:24.782
for Peace and Progress
Through Technology...

36:24.782 --> 36:26.784
(high-pitched feedback)

36:26.784 --> 36:27.785
Uh... oh.

36:27.785 --> 36:30.288
(laughing)

36:30.288 --> 36:31.289
Uh...

36:31.789 --> 36:33.291
I have a head
like a rock!

36:33.291 --> 36:34.292
All right, all right,

36:34.792 --> 36:36.794
just stay cool
and calm about this.

36:36.794 --> 36:37.795
(sighs softly)

36:38.296 --> 36:39.297
You trust me?

36:39.297 --> 36:41.799
Yes. To do what?

36:47.305 --> 36:49.807
I got an idea.

36:49.807 --> 36:52.810
I just need something
interesting for
you to look at.

36:56.814 --> 37:00.818
It's not bad
if I can add to it.

37:03.821 --> 37:06.824
Oh, yeah-- perfect.

37:08.326 --> 37:10.328
Now a little adjustment...

37:11.329 --> 37:14.832
and we'll be in business.

37:18.336 --> 37:21.339
Isn't this
the prettiest little thing?

37:26.344 --> 37:28.346
(grunting)

37:40.858 --> 37:42.860
Are you trying
to hypnotize me?

37:43.361 --> 37:45.863
No, I'm not trying
to hypnotize you.

37:45.863 --> 37:47.365
I just want you
to relax your mind

37:47.865 --> 37:48.866
so that half-a-memory

37:48.866 --> 37:50.368
can come to the
surface, all right?

37:50.368 --> 37:52.870
Okay. I trust you.

37:52.870 --> 37:53.871
Good.

37:53.871 --> 37:56.374
Almost.

37:57.375 --> 37:58.876
Kiss me.

37:58.876 --> 37:59.877
What?

37:59.877 --> 38:01.379
Kiss me.

38:03.381 --> 38:05.383
Okay.

38:08.386 --> 38:09.387
No.

38:09.387 --> 38:10.888
Kiss me!

38:24.402 --> 38:25.903
Now I trust you.

38:25.903 --> 38:28.906
Good.

38:28.906 --> 38:30.908
Let's go.

38:33.411 --> 38:34.912
INGRID:
Craig, you know

38:34.912 --> 38:36.914
that four of your men
have been killed recently.

38:36.914 --> 38:38.416
BANNISTER:
Damn right I know.

38:38.416 --> 38:40.418
INGRID:
Now you're going to get

38:40.418 --> 38:42.420
the two people
who killed them--

38:42.420 --> 38:44.422
MacGyver and Victoria Tomanova.

38:52.430 --> 38:54.432
Are you ready, Comrade?

38:54.432 --> 38:56.434
Perfectly.

38:56.434 --> 38:58.436
Craig, it's time now.

38:58.436 --> 39:01.939
They're inside
waiting for you.

39:19.457 --> 39:20.958
This is a risk.

39:20.958 --> 39:22.960
It is necessary.

39:22.960 --> 39:24.462
The Tomanova woman saw me.

39:24.462 --> 39:25.963
She obviously
did not remember,

39:25.963 --> 39:28.466
but at any moment,
she could identify me.

39:30.968 --> 39:33.471
All right, now, I
want you to relax.

39:33.471 --> 39:35.473
I'm going to
throw some words
out at you,

39:35.473 --> 39:37.475
and I just want
you to respond.

39:37.475 --> 39:38.476
Don't even think, okay?

39:38.476 --> 39:39.977
Okay.

39:39.977 --> 39:40.978
Good.

39:43.481 --> 39:44.982
Moscow.

39:44.982 --> 39:46.484
Cold.

39:46.984 --> 39:48.486
Thornton.

39:48.486 --> 39:49.987
Escape.

39:52.990 --> 39:54.992
America.

39:54.992 --> 39:56.994
Freedom.

39:56.994 --> 39:58.496
Noise.

39:58.496 --> 39:59.997
Dizzy.

40:01.499 --> 40:03.501
(sighing):
Mather.

40:03.501 --> 40:04.502
Puzzle.

40:04.502 --> 40:05.002
MacGyver?

40:12.510 --> 40:14.011
MacGYVER:
Lem?

40:14.011 --> 40:15.513
Killer. Death.

40:15.513 --> 40:16.514
Bannister?

40:18.015 --> 40:19.517
Worried.

40:19.517 --> 40:21.519
(sighs):
Ingrid?

40:21.519 --> 40:23.020
Wrong.

40:23.020 --> 40:25.523
What?

40:25.523 --> 40:28.526
Somehow... the name is wrong.

40:28.526 --> 40:29.527
What, Bannister?

40:29.527 --> 40:31.028
No, what's maiden name?

40:31.028 --> 40:34.532
Oh... I don't know.

40:34.532 --> 40:36.534
There is something.

40:36.534 --> 40:37.535
All right, wait a minute here.

40:39.537 --> 40:41.539
(audio running backwards)

40:43.541 --> 40:47.044
MacGYVER:
Picture her face,
her walk,

40:47.044 --> 40:50.047
her clothes, in a
totally different place.

40:52.049 --> 40:54.552
I remember the building.
Where?

40:54.552 --> 40:57.555
My office
at G.R.U. Headquarters.

40:57.555 --> 40:59.557
I saw her in uniform.

40:59.557 --> 41:00.558
What kind?

41:01.058 --> 41:02.059
Red Army.

41:02.059 --> 41:05.563
It was years ago, but...
but it was her.

41:05.563 --> 41:08.065
She still
seems so young.

41:08.065 --> 41:10.568
A girl...

41:11.068 --> 41:13.571
but she's Army Intelligence.

41:13.571 --> 41:15.573
MacGYVER:
Army Intelligence?
Ingrid?

41:15.573 --> 41:19.076
MacGyver, she was chosen--
designed to seem

41:19.076 --> 41:22.580
as a little,
young American girl, innocent.

41:22.580 --> 41:25.082
But she's not innocent.

41:25.082 --> 41:28.586
She's, uh...
what you say, lethal.

41:29.086 --> 41:31.589
She's perhaps more dangerous
than Lem

41:31.589 --> 41:34.592
because she looks
so fragile.

41:34.592 --> 41:35.593
MacGYVER:
All right...

41:35.593 --> 41:38.095
then she's the mole.

41:38.095 --> 41:40.598
Not exactly, MacGyver.

41:40.598 --> 41:43.100
Craig?

41:43.100 --> 41:45.102
You're the traitor, Mac.

41:45.102 --> 41:47.104
You and that Soviet spy.

41:47.104 --> 41:49.607
Between you,
you killed
four good men.

41:49.607 --> 41:50.608
He's the mole?

41:50.608 --> 41:52.610
And doesn't know it, of course.

41:52.610 --> 41:54.111
But actually, Mac,

41:54.111 --> 41:57.615
you have just
been selected
to be the mole,

41:57.615 --> 41:59.617
andyouwill
be executed.

41:59.617 --> 42:01.118
Pete Thornton will
be heartbroken,

42:01.118 --> 42:02.620
shattered.

42:02.620 --> 42:04.622
He might even resign,

42:04.622 --> 42:07.124
making room for Craig.

42:10.127 --> 42:12.129
All right, dear.

42:19.637 --> 42:21.639
Now, Craig!

42:23.641 --> 42:25.142
(gunshot)

42:25.643 --> 42:27.645
(Bannister grunting)

42:32.149 --> 42:34.151
(grunting)

42:37.154 --> 42:39.156
Hold it, Mac;
put the gun down.

42:47.164 --> 42:48.165
Viki, no.

43:07.685 --> 43:09.186
Craig?

43:11.689 --> 43:15.192
You know it's not me.

43:15.192 --> 43:17.194
You know it's her-- Ingrid.

43:17.194 --> 43:19.196
She ran you, man.

43:19.196 --> 43:21.198
She used you.

43:21.198 --> 43:22.700
You're the traitor.

43:23.200 --> 43:25.703
You and that Soviet woman.

43:25.703 --> 43:28.706
Craig, listen to me.

43:28.706 --> 43:30.708
Look at me.

43:30.708 --> 43:33.711
You pulled me out
of East Germany.

43:33.711 --> 43:35.212
I covered you in Burma.

43:35.212 --> 43:37.715
We ran the Panjuk together,

43:37.715 --> 43:38.716
and we got out...

43:38.716 --> 43:41.719
together.

43:41.719 --> 43:44.221
Together.

43:44.221 --> 43:45.723
It's useless, MacGyver.

43:45.723 --> 43:48.225
For four weeks
on our honeymoon,

43:48.225 --> 43:49.727
he was programmed
every day.

43:49.727 --> 43:52.229
He's ours... for good.

43:52.229 --> 43:55.232
MacGYVER:
You want to bet?

43:55.232 --> 43:57.234
Take a look at
what's going on here, lady.

43:58.736 --> 44:00.738
No...

44:04.241 --> 44:06.243
Oh, yeah.

44:08.746 --> 44:11.749
He's still mine, MacGyver.

44:12.249 --> 44:13.250
(electronic whirring)

44:13.250 --> 44:15.252
(screaming)

44:15.252 --> 44:16.754
BANNISTER:
Oh, Mac!

44:16.754 --> 44:18.756
(coughing
and groaning)

44:19.256 --> 44:21.258
Oh, my God!

44:28.265 --> 44:32.269
Viki, get his shirt open.

44:32.269 --> 44:33.771
His heart
isn't damaged yet.

44:33.771 --> 44:35.272
(groaning)

44:35.272 --> 44:37.775
If I can get electric current
through his system,

44:37.775 --> 44:38.776
it'll break the
magnetic field

44:38.776 --> 44:40.277
and counteract
the clotting.

45:01.298 --> 45:04.802
All right, Viki,
move away.

45:10.307 --> 45:11.809
Craig!

45:11.809 --> 45:15.312
Craig!

45:15.312 --> 45:17.815
(electrical buzzing
and Bannister groaning)

45:17.815 --> 45:18.816
Craig!

45:18.816 --> 45:21.819
Fight it! Fight!

45:22.820 --> 45:24.822
(groaning)

45:24.822 --> 45:26.824
(coughing)

45:28.325 --> 45:29.827
Come on.

45:29.827 --> 45:32.329
(groaning)

45:32.329 --> 45:34.331
(coughing)

45:34.331 --> 45:35.833
He's breathing.

45:35.833 --> 45:36.834
Come on, Craig.

45:36.834 --> 45:42.339
Mac... what're you doing?

45:42.339 --> 45:43.841
(coughing)

45:43.841 --> 45:45.342
(coughing continues)

45:47.845 --> 45:51.348
(breathing heavily)

45:56.854 --> 46:00.357
John Wayne could not
have done it better.
