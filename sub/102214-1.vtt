first-class,

to your heathenistic
poor man's Coachella.

00:50.441 --> 00:53.270
No, no, no.
No, don't take it personal.

00:53.357 --> 00:56.491
I'm his publicist, sweetie.
That's my job.

00:56.578 --> 00:59.059
He's on the verge of becoming
a goddamn star.

to the best next dance song

01:11.158 --> 01:12.811
since the Macarena.

01:12.898 --> 01:16.772
If you want my client,
put up or piss the fuck off.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.126

01:49.979 --> 01:51.459

I'm sorry.

you asked me to do.

10 minutes away

04:10.598 --> 04:12.034
Jake, it's horror.

04:12.121 --> 04:13.601
Seventy years of genre tropes

04:13.688 --> 04:17.082
that gore porn
is not about logic,

04:17.169 --> 04:19.433
it's about the squirm factor.

04:21.391 --> 04:24.873
Okay, remember when we were 8
and I fell off my bike?

04:24.960 --> 04:27.528
Remember, you wouldn't help me
up because the skin was...

04:27.615 --> 04:29.312

-...hanging off my knee.

04:29.399 --> 04:31.053
Yeah, yeah.
You left me at the playground.

04:31.140 --> 04:33.185
The playground
where that homeless bag lady

04:33.273 --> 04:35.623
used to quote old episodes
of "Murder She Wrote."

04:41.977 --> 04:44.675
Well, it practically is.
It's not real.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.461
[Jake]
It's real enough.

04:47.548 --> 04:50.638
Oh, my God,
you are an actual limp dick.

04:50.725 --> 04:53.293
Is there anything else you're
still holding a grudge about?

04:54.424 --> 04:55.773
Eat me.

04:55.860 --> 04:57.209
[laughing]

04:57.297 --> 04:58.646
I'm being serious.

04:58.733 --> 05:00.387
So we're about to be 22
next month.

05:00.474 --> 05:03.085
If you've got any repressed
prepubescent confessions,

05:03.172 --> 05:04.391
I need to know.

05:04.478 --> 05:06.436
It's best-friend privilege.

05:06.523 --> 05:08.873
-You're ridiculous and awful.
-Isn't that why you adore me?

-Here, you want some Skittles?

05:11.180 --> 05:13.225
I had all the green ones,
but you hate them anyway,

05:13.313 --> 05:14.662
so you're welcome.

05:18.361 --> 05:20.276
I give you once more
your freedom.

05:20.363 --> 05:22.844
I give you life.

[Pierce laughing]

05:30.982 --> 05:32.288
Not now. We're done.

05:32.375 --> 05:33.594
I don't want to watch this
anymore.

05:33.681 --> 05:35.335
No, dude, you promised me,

05:35.422 --> 05:37.511
a Halloween movie Fridays
for entire month of October.

05:37.598 --> 05:38.947

[Jake]
Your phone's getting more action

05:41.341 --> 05:43.430
than my sister after she went
on birth control.

05:43.517 --> 05:45.823
I really don't want
to talk to him.

05:45.910 --> 05:49.653
He's like three cups
of boyfriend material too many.

05:51.263 --> 05:52.613
Uh, how so?

05:52.700 --> 05:54.571
How so?

05:54.658 --> 05:57.487
He's like overly communicative,
and emotionally available,

05:57.574 --> 05:59.968
and always wants
to be with me.

06:00.055 --> 06:02.100
Just not what a real
relationship should be.

06:02.187 --> 06:04.451
Sounds a bit like me
and our friendship.

06:04.538 --> 06:06.757
Is that not real either?

06:06.844 --> 06:09.325
Oh, yeah, but we're not
sleeping together.

06:11.501 --> 06:13.111
Well, I hate to break it to you,

06:13.198 --> 06:14.591
but sleeping with someone

06:14.678 --> 06:16.767
doesn't make a relationship real
either.

06:17.768 --> 06:19.596
Can I just be 21?

06:19.683 --> 06:22.382
Can I just be completely
incapable

06:22.469 --> 06:25.559
of emotional commitment
to internalized self-loathing?

06:25.646 --> 06:27.996
-A lot of big words.
-A lot of big words.

06:28.083 --> 06:29.867
You know,
I don't know what I want.

06:29.954 --> 06:32.304
Maybe I'm just having, like,
an emotional midlife crisis.

06:32.392 --> 06:35.482
It's that sociopathic
floodgate breaking.

06:35.569 --> 06:37.005
-[chuckling]
-Yeah.

06:37.092 --> 06:38.615
You're becoming
who you really you are.

06:40.487 --> 06:42.967
You are going to be last to die
on my shit list.

06:43.054 --> 06:45.230
How's that for real
friendship?

06:45.317 --> 06:46.797
-Ooh!
-Hmm?

07:11.474 --> 07:13.389
That was a little harsh.

Probably should've given you
a heads up, huh?

weren't supposed

07:35.890 --> 07:37.326
Oh, no.

Did I ruin the consummation

07:39.284 --> 07:40.460

of friendship?

Nope.

are so boring.

in decades.

08:00.784 --> 08:03.004
It's been three years, huh?

08:03.091 --> 08:05.397
Yeah, it has.

you did this!

Did what? Not helping.

08:49.224 --> 08:50.573
We are going out tonight.

like the same day.

09:06.894 --> 09:09.026
Well, I know your birthday
isn't for another few weeks,

09:09.113 --> 09:11.942
but I figured, since I'm going
to be here anyway,

09:12.029 --> 09:14.031
we could celebrate early.

09:14.118 --> 09:15.642
That is awesome!

09:15.729 --> 09:17.644
Wow, okay.
Judging by the name,

09:17.731 --> 09:19.428
I'm going to guess
it's something anti-Jake?

09:19.515 --> 09:21.996
No, no, you're going.

09:22.083 --> 09:25.216
It is a 10-hour party
with six different EDM artists,

09:25.303 --> 09:29.699
and I hear that lewd acts
and cocaine are encouraged.

09:29.786 --> 09:31.222
-[laughs]
-Yeah, no.

09:31.309 --> 09:33.964
It sounds like a breeding ground
for an STI.

09:34.051 --> 09:35.400
I'm going to sit this one out.

to have to do this,

-You got chlamydia.
-Wait, why are you doing this?

09:46.673 --> 09:48.283
I covered for your ass
and told the nurse

09:48.370 --> 09:50.241
I need a Z-Pack
for a lady-part staph infection.

10:15.484 --> 10:17.442
Also, these tickets were
really fucking expensive

10:17.529 --> 10:19.575
and I have crippling
med school debts,

in your anxiety

12:11.861 --> 12:13.602
-[Jake] Whoa.
-[Ivy laughs]

12:13.689 --> 12:15.430
That's what I was afraid of.

12:15.517 --> 12:16.823
Okay, let's get drinks.

12:16.910 --> 12:19.390
Shots on me.

12:19.477 --> 12:22.002
-I'm okay, actually.
-[Pierce] Okay, lies.

12:22.089 --> 12:24.308
You've been drinking
since you were 14.

12:24.395 --> 12:25.832
She always could outdrink
her exes.

12:25.919 --> 12:27.398
I bet.

12:27.485 --> 12:29.661
Well, I am turning over
a new leaf.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.273
Med school has been
very illuminating.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.492
Okay, well, can you maybe
turn this leaf over after...

12:38.540 --> 12:39.802
Are you pregnant?

12:39.889 --> 12:41.064
Yeah.

12:41.151 --> 12:43.501
No! No, I am not.

12:43.588 --> 12:45.765
Seriously, Pierce,
come on.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.027
-Oh, my God.
-[chuckling]

12:47.114 --> 12:48.898
Okay, Brecken? No?

12:48.985 --> 12:50.857
-Sorry.
-Jake?

12:50.944 --> 12:52.859
Dude, drinking alone
makes me an alcoholic.

12:52.946 --> 12:55.949
No, drinking excessively
makes you an alcoholic.

12:56.036 --> 12:57.689
-Go.
-[Pierce] Are you kidding me?

12:57.777 --> 12:59.735
-Off you go, come on.
-Yeah, come on, kids.

12:59.822 --> 13:01.389
[Ivy]
Yes, get out of here.

13:01.476 --> 13:03.173
We'll wait for you.

13:07.743 --> 13:10.093
You guys are freakishly similar.

13:16.230 --> 13:18.754
[knock on door]

13:18.841 --> 13:20.451
[Zeke]
Your set starts at 12:45.

13:20.538 --> 13:21.713
You need anything?

13:21.801 --> 13:25.630
Water, vodka, MacBook charger?

13:25.717 --> 13:27.502
[Dylan]
How much are you getting paid?

13:27.589 --> 13:29.243
[Zeke]
Excuse me?

13:29.330 --> 13:30.853
I'm just curious
why you felt entitled

13:30.940 --> 13:32.855
to mock someone
who could get you fired.

13:34.639 --> 13:37.817
It was a joke, actually.

13:45.737 --> 13:47.652
[sighs]

13:48.610 --> 13:49.959
[laughs]
Fuck.

13:50.046 --> 13:52.005
I'm fucking with you.

13:52.092 --> 13:53.702
Come on, lighten up.

13:53.789 --> 13:55.617
Hey, if you happen to see
my agent or my publicist,

13:55.704 --> 13:57.271
can you send them this way?

13:57.358 --> 13:58.707
They were meant to be here
hours ago.

13:58.794 --> 14:00.056
Of course.

14:02.058 --> 14:03.494
Hey, so do those--?

14:03.581 --> 14:06.976
Do those actually work
to capture dreams?

14:07.063 --> 14:09.413
They're apotropaic.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.894
Protective magic.

14:11.981 --> 14:14.723
Wards against evil,
misfortune.

14:16.943 --> 14:19.119
The webbing's based
on spiderwebs

14:19.206 --> 14:21.773
stemming from Asibikaashi,

14:21.861 --> 14:23.775
the spider grandmother.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.256
My great-grandfather
was Ojibwe.

14:27.649 --> 14:29.999
Wow, you are next level.

14:30.086 --> 14:31.479
[chuckling]

14:31.566 --> 14:34.047
Thought it was kind of like
a gimmick.

14:34.134 --> 14:36.092
Yeah, most people do.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.269
The beautiful thing
,about heritage is

14:39.356 --> 14:41.054
I'm not obligated
to explain it.

14:44.057 --> 14:45.449
You a fan of EDM?

14:48.148 --> 14:49.758
Yeah, yeah.

14:49.845 --> 14:51.368
Actually...

14:51.455 --> 14:54.154
It's actually the reason
why that I took the gig.

14:54.241 --> 14:56.939
My favorite was your show
in Sedona last year.

14:58.549 --> 15:01.465
The show where those two teams
off themselves.

15:01.552 --> 15:04.338
Yeah, the pagan blood ritual
or something, right?

15:04.425 --> 15:07.994
Dude, it was kooky shit, man.

15:09.343 --> 15:11.954
But you know,
I kind of loved it.

15:12.041 --> 15:13.477
Never mind.

15:13.564 --> 15:15.915
So, dude, how'd you get
your big break?

15:16.002 --> 15:18.091
[sighs and clears throat]

15:18.178 --> 15:20.484
Are you familiar
with Faust?

15:21.529 --> 15:23.444
-No.
-Hm.

15:23.531 --> 15:27.970
He sold his soul to the devil
in exchange for success,

15:28.057 --> 15:30.059
knowledge, worldly pleasure.

15:31.626 --> 15:33.497
At 20, I did
the same thing.

15:35.151 --> 15:37.023
Yeah, why do you think
I carry around protection?

15:37.110 --> 15:39.155
You know, my passion.

15:39.242 --> 15:40.722
My-- My drive.

15:40.809 --> 15:44.030
It comes from knowing
I'm two steps from hell.

15:46.554 --> 15:48.556
Oh, my God, yes.

15:50.775 --> 15:52.516
[dance music playing]

15:52.603 --> 15:55.128
Disneyland, yeah.

15:55.215 --> 15:57.826
This is like a high school dance
on speed.

15:57.913 --> 15:59.306
Yeah, well,
you never really went

15:59.393 --> 16:01.264
to a high school dance, so...

16:01.351 --> 16:03.963
You spent prom night
gorging on Arby's

16:04.050 --> 16:05.660
and watching
"The Little Mermaid."

16:05.747 --> 16:08.880
And I will not
apologize for that.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.752
-Thank you.
-[laughing] You should.

16:10.839 --> 16:14.277
Just-- You know what?
I have an idea. Close your eyes.

16:15.409 --> 16:18.629
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.

16:18.716 --> 16:20.022
Just once.

16:20.109 --> 16:21.589
Okay, there you go.

16:21.676 --> 16:23.417
Relax.

16:23.504 --> 16:25.245
-Just feel the bass.
-[dance music throbbing]

16:25.332 --> 16:27.290
Yeah, you feel it
a little bit?

16:28.291 --> 16:29.771
Okay, good.

16:29.858 --> 16:32.165
It's more than just the music,
it's....

16:33.557 --> 16:35.951
It's like a spiritual
experience.

16:41.435 --> 16:43.872
Okay, there you go.

16:49.617 --> 16:51.488
Okay, limp dick.

16:51.575 --> 16:53.273
There you go.

16:55.623 --> 16:58.060
No fucking way.

17:07.504 --> 17:09.289
I know you.

17:09.376 --> 17:12.031
Aren't you supposed
to be DJ Dream Catcher?

17:13.554 --> 17:15.860
Are you worried about getting
mobbed out here?

17:15.947 --> 17:19.125
I'm just another face
in a room full of strangers.

17:20.517 --> 17:22.780
Why do you think I always
wear a mask?

17:24.347 --> 17:25.609
Pierce?

17:26.610 --> 17:28.830
Pierce?

17:28.917 --> 17:30.832
-I like your outfit.
-Thank you.

17:30.919 --> 17:33.052
My sister let me
borrow it.

17:33.139 --> 17:35.184
Oh, is she here?

17:36.185 --> 17:37.839
Oh, is that your move?

17:37.926 --> 17:39.580
That's what you do?

17:39.667 --> 17:43.149
Scope out the crowd early,
and charm a girl or two

17:43.236 --> 17:45.803
for a little
drunken fun later?

17:45.890 --> 17:47.762
Presumptuous.

17:47.849 --> 17:49.677
Are you always
this judgmental?

17:49.764 --> 17:51.244
Yeah.

17:53.202 --> 17:55.813
I mean, uh, no.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.815
I'm guarded.

17:57.902 --> 17:59.600
Huh.

17:59.687 --> 18:01.080
I'm Pierce.

18:04.735 --> 18:06.476
-I'm...
-I know.

18:08.261 --> 18:09.740
...Dylan.

18:13.222 --> 18:15.616
[dance music blaring]

18:15.703 --> 18:17.792
-Have you seen Pierce?
-Seriously?

18:17.879 --> 18:19.098
-[Pierce laughs]
-Oh!

18:19.185 --> 18:21.230
Where did you go?

18:21.317 --> 18:23.450
Wow, Jesus,
you're lucky this was free.

18:23.537 --> 18:25.974
I met a boy in line.

18:26.061 --> 18:27.802
He seduced me
into a dark corner

18:27.889 --> 18:32.198
and ravished me to the sound
of hard, pulsing drumbeats.

18:32.285 --> 18:33.460
[laughs]

18:33.547 --> 18:34.939
Gross.

18:35.026 --> 18:36.767
I'm joking.

18:36.854 --> 18:39.248
Well, kind of.
I did meet a boy in line.

18:39.335 --> 18:41.076
Not just any boy.

18:41.163 --> 18:43.339
One of the headlining DJs.

18:43.426 --> 18:45.080
Okay, what did he say?

18:45.167 --> 18:48.039
Just, you know, the usual
groupie filter questions.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.389
His number.

18:49.476 --> 18:50.868
-Stop.
-[laughs] Yes.

18:50.955 --> 18:53.219
He's really sweet,
and he's humble,

18:53.306 --> 18:56.526
and he invited me back
to his room before the set,

18:56.613 --> 18:59.138
and offered us
VIP seats during.

18:59.225 --> 19:01.575
I mean, you're smarter
than that.

19:01.662 --> 19:03.881
I don't really feel like
stroking your ego

19:03.968 --> 19:05.709
when he breaks your heart
after he gets his way,

19:05.796 --> 19:07.363
so go have fun.

19:07.450 --> 19:08.973
Wow. Thank you.

19:09.060 --> 19:11.150
Good to know you think
I'm such a slut, Jake.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.631
Anyone else want to shame me
while he's at it?

19:14.718 --> 19:18.983
Shame you? I'm being protective.
You know, what friends do.

19:19.070 --> 19:21.508
-This isn't the first time you--
-Fuck you, Jake.

19:21.595 --> 19:23.118
You don't know
what you're talking about.

19:23.205 --> 19:25.425
Okay, Pierce,
he didn't mean anything by it.

19:25.512 --> 19:28.123
-Don't go off the deep end.
-Wow!

19:28.210 --> 19:31.213
Good to know my own sister
won't even defend me either.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.997
Great. Here we go.

19:33.084 --> 19:34.695
You want to chime in, too?

19:36.392 --> 19:38.873
No? Okay, well, you know what?
I'm going to go.

19:38.960 --> 19:41.397
I'm going to go get some air
and pamper my vagina,

19:41.484 --> 19:43.138
get ready for a pounding,

19:43.225 --> 19:45.445
because apparently
that's the kind of person I am.

19:45.532 --> 19:46.837
[Ivy]
Wait.

19:48.143 --> 19:50.232
Come on,
we just got here!

19:51.233 --> 19:53.017
[sighing]

20:00.373 --> 20:02.244
[chuckling]

20:02.331 --> 20:03.811
[Hunter]
Pierce?

20:04.812 --> 20:06.596
Oh, this can't be real.

20:10.165 --> 20:12.123
Have you upgraded
to stalking me now?

20:12.211 --> 20:15.039
That's not stalking,
it's binge research.

20:15.126 --> 20:16.606
-Hm.
-I thought you were into that.

20:16.693 --> 20:18.347
Isn't "Psycho"
your favorite movie?

20:18.434 --> 20:21.002
Wow, such a hard person
to see these days.

20:21.089 --> 20:22.308
What a coincidence.

20:22.395 --> 20:23.787
Hm.

20:24.875 --> 20:26.399
Hi.

20:26.486 --> 20:27.965
Have I seen you before?

20:28.052 --> 20:29.837
I don't think so.

20:29.924 --> 20:32.709
I mean, you look like
you go to Target,

20:32.796 --> 20:34.363
so maybe there.

20:37.845 --> 20:40.630
-Maybe there.
-[Raye] Okay, makes sense.

20:40.717 --> 20:42.415
I'm Raye.

20:42.502 --> 20:44.721
-Like a gun?
-[Raye] No.

20:44.808 --> 20:46.636
Like the sun.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.074
Did you and Hunter
go to college together?

20:50.161 --> 20:52.860
You went to college?
Wait, now I remember.

20:52.947 --> 20:55.297
You said you did two semesters
of Phoenix online, right?

20:55.384 --> 20:57.865
-Hm.
-Yeah.

20:57.952 --> 20:59.606
We met on a dating app.

20:59.693 --> 21:02.957
Ah, looks like
that didn't work out.

21:03.044 --> 21:05.438
Well, I guess that depends
who you ask.

21:05.525 --> 21:08.615
I was looking for friends
and fucks, you know?

21:08.702 --> 21:10.878
Too buried under
all my law school applications

21:10.965 --> 21:12.793
to worry about romance.

21:12.880 --> 21:15.448
-Future Cochran here.
-[Raye] Where are you applying?

21:15.535 --> 21:18.494
I'm actually
in my final semester now.

21:18.581 --> 21:20.540
You know, I'm already
building a client list

21:20.627 --> 21:24.065
and actively participate
in cases.

21:24.152 --> 21:26.154
That is truly fascinating.

21:26.241 --> 21:28.243
It was so great meeting you.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.637
So great running into you.

21:30.724 --> 21:32.813
Listen, Pierce.

21:32.900 --> 21:36.033
[Ivy] Defensive and reactionary
have always been Pierce's go-to.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.861
She's been going through
a lot lately.

21:37.948 --> 21:40.211
She's convinced she's having
a quarter-life crisis.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.952
Yeah, babe,
it's a quarter-life crisis

21:42.039 --> 21:44.085
that's been going on
since she was five years old.

21:45.521 --> 21:46.957
[sighs]
I know you're dense,

21:47.044 --> 21:49.743
but this is textbook narcissism,
Hunter.

21:49.830 --> 21:52.267
Law school applications?

21:52.354 --> 21:54.400
I guess toiling away
at Trader Joe's,

21:54.487 --> 21:58.665
working on your romance novel
is not sexy enough for you.

21:58.752 --> 22:00.057
Sexy?

22:00.144 --> 22:02.973
Okay, do not
turn this around.

22:03.060 --> 22:07.456
You ambush me here with
Ruth Bader Ginsbitch in, what,

22:07.543 --> 22:10.372
hopes that I'll be jealous
and leap into your arms?

22:10.459 --> 22:12.635
You made me split the check
with you on our first date,

22:12.722 --> 22:15.856
but you'll spend 150 bucks
to stalk me here.

22:17.510 --> 22:18.989
-[sighing]
-It was sex.

22:19.076 --> 22:20.730
No commitment.

22:22.645 --> 22:24.560
I'm not someone you want
to get involved with anyway.

22:24.647 --> 22:26.823
-Trust me.
-Look, it wasn't just sex,

22:26.910 --> 22:29.217
even though
it was good sex.

22:30.827 --> 22:33.961
It was real connection.
It was real conversation.

22:34.048 --> 22:36.442
-[drunken laughter]
-Jesus Christ.

22:41.142 --> 22:44.014
Being smitten sucks.

22:45.146 --> 22:46.800
Imagine being Raye.

22:48.802 --> 22:50.891
...you go to a rave and you
think you're someone's date,

22:50.978 --> 22:53.284
and then they fucking leave you
for another bitch.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.721
-That's tough.
-Yeah.

22:54.808 --> 22:56.636
Imagine being you.

23:08.082 --> 23:10.389
You must think
I'm a complete idiot,

23:10.476 --> 23:12.956
or maybe it's just you.

23:13.043 --> 23:16.656

42:57.226 --> 42:59.533
Please, what do you want?

42:59.620 --> 43:01.056
I don't have anything!

43:01.143 --> 43:03.015
Please!

43:05.060 --> 43:07.410
Please, please, no! Ah!

43:07.497 --> 43:09.412
Please, no!

43:09.499 --> 43:11.371
[screams]

43:11.458 --> 43:13.939
[dance music throbbing]

43:39.138 --> 43:41.575
I saw Ivy's arm.

43:43.577 --> 43:45.797
Not exactly subtle.

43:45.884 --> 43:47.886
Why didn't she call Pierce?

43:49.061 --> 43:51.237
You saw how they
were together.

43:51.324 --> 43:52.630
[sniffles]

43:56.938 --> 43:58.636
It's-- It's not my place, okay?

43:58.723 --> 44:00.159
[Jake, chuckling]
Oh, right.

44:00.246 --> 44:01.639
Right, that excuse.

44:01.726 --> 44:03.597
[Brecken sighing]

44:05.425 --> 44:09.211
Ivy and I were in an on-campus
support group together.

44:11.170 --> 44:14.216
At the time,
we both had body dysmorphia

44:14.303 --> 44:17.089
and anxiety-turned-depression.

44:17.176 --> 44:21.136
We held each other's hands
when pain got too heavy.

44:21.223 --> 44:23.399
[pills rattle]

44:23.486 --> 44:24.879
Oh, we laughed,

44:24.966 --> 44:26.664
we cried...

44:28.230 --> 44:29.362
we learned.

44:29.449 --> 44:31.233
[sniffles]

44:32.234 --> 44:33.845
Ivy made me feel safe.

44:34.976 --> 44:38.023
She made everyone feel safe.

44:40.460 --> 44:42.201
And then one night, she--

44:42.288 --> 44:46.161
She stopped responding
to my text and my calls, and...

44:46.248 --> 44:47.859
I knew.

44:47.946 --> 44:50.600
I fucking knew
what was happening.

44:52.733 --> 44:53.908
[sobs]

44:53.995 --> 44:55.431
She needed me,

44:55.518 --> 44:56.998
and I was paralyzed.

44:57.085 --> 45:01.046
I was helpless,
because I was terrified

45:01.133 --> 45:02.656
that maybe this is what
she really wanted.

45:02.743 --> 45:05.485
Maybe it was her only way.

45:05.572 --> 45:07.835
[Jake]
Pierce wasn't like that.

45:09.358 --> 45:12.274
She had pain, yeah.

45:12.361 --> 45:13.798
But...

45:15.321 --> 45:17.802
But not like that.

45:17.889 --> 45:19.934
No one has the power
to measure someone's pain.

45:21.806 --> 45:23.851
It's one of the flaws
of humanity.

45:26.332 --> 45:28.377
We can look for it,
we can assume,

45:28.464 --> 45:30.815
but we can never
know for sure.

45:30.902 --> 45:35.515
Stop, okay? Don't--
Don't project Ivy onto Pierce.

45:35.602 --> 45:37.735
[sobbing]
It's not fair

45:37.822 --> 45:38.997
and it's not true.

45:39.084 --> 45:40.346
Listen to me.

45:42.000 --> 45:47.005
I spent most of my childhood
deflecting, okay?

45:48.354 --> 45:51.574
It didn't make
anything better.

45:51.661 --> 45:52.967
It was...

45:54.534 --> 45:56.623
It made me feel good
for a second,

45:56.710 --> 45:59.626
but it didn't change
a fucking thing.

46:00.758 --> 46:02.107
So, I'm sorry, Jake.

46:02.194 --> 46:03.456
I'm...

46:05.327 --> 46:06.764
Fuck.

46:32.311 --> 46:33.878
[sighs]

47:46.211 --> 47:47.952
[voices whispering]

47:58.440 --> 48:00.703
[voices whispering]

48:47.054 --> 48:49.187
[breathing heavily]

48:56.629 --> 48:58.152
Get it together,
get it together,

48:58.239 --> 49:00.894
get it together,
get it together,
get it together,

49:00.981 --> 49:02.635
get it together,
get it together.

49:02.722 --> 49:03.984
Get it together.

49:05.072 --> 49:06.944
Get it together.

49:09.772 --> 49:11.905
[indistinct whispering]

49:15.822 --> 49:17.867
[growling]

49:33.448 --> 49:35.711
Get it together,
get it together.

49:37.496 --> 49:40.064
Fuck this. Fuck this.

49:41.152 --> 49:42.588
You bitch!

49:42.675 --> 49:43.893
Fucking stop!

49:43.981 --> 49:45.460
[grunting]

49:50.813 --> 49:52.119
Fuck!

49:52.206 --> 49:54.208
[panting]

49:59.605 --> 50:02.086
[Ivy]
Before med school,

50:02.173 --> 50:06.090
Pierce and I used to go
on a camping trip every fall.

50:08.614 --> 50:09.876
[sniffling]

50:09.963 --> 50:11.617
It was a sister retreat.

50:13.532 --> 50:15.316
Somewhere new each time.

50:19.799 --> 50:22.628
And no matter how much time
we spent together,

50:22.715 --> 50:25.544
we never got tired
of each other.

50:30.418 --> 50:32.725
I still don't know
where it all went wrong.

50:35.641 --> 50:36.990
[sniffles]

50:42.648 --> 50:46.739
I don't want to break again,
but I can feel it.

50:47.827 --> 50:49.176
[sniffles]

50:49.263 --> 50:51.961
I can feel the fracturing
beneath my skin.

50:55.574 --> 50:59.491
I keep playing it over and over
again in my mind.

50:59.578 --> 51:01.710
Her eyes.

51:01.797 --> 51:03.756
We've got to be strong.

51:04.844 --> 51:06.759
You've got to be strong.

51:06.846 --> 51:09.109
I don't want to be strong.

51:10.284 --> 51:11.938
I want to be angry.

51:13.461 --> 51:16.551
This isn't fucking
support group, Brecken.

51:18.118 --> 51:20.425
Being strong
is not going to do anything.

51:20.512 --> 51:23.297
Yeah, well,
neither is being vengeful.

51:23.384 --> 51:26.213
We're not going
to take their money,

51:26.300 --> 51:28.346
but we can't go in there
guns blazing

51:28.433 --> 51:29.825
like a fucking
Tarantino movie.

51:29.912 --> 51:32.437
We are better than that, Ivy.

51:36.745 --> 51:41.228
We're going to use
that lawyer girl and...

51:42.925 --> 51:45.841
we'll find a real solution.

51:50.803 --> 51:52.326
Yeah.

51:52.413 --> 51:53.893
Come on.

52:01.509 --> 52:02.858
[sighs]

52:05.905 --> 52:07.167
[sniffles]

52:11.519 --> 52:14.087
I can't believe she's gone.

52:32.105 --> 52:33.802
[Josephine]
No, I haven't heard from her.

52:33.889 --> 52:35.369
[Josephine sighing]

52:35.456 --> 52:38.111
Yes, I left the envelope
where you told me to.

52:38.198 --> 52:39.547
Well, you know, Kya.

52:39.634 --> 52:41.462
[chuckles]
She got paid,

52:41.549 --> 52:44.378
so she's probably juggling
three martinis and three men.

52:44.465 --> 52:47.555
As long as she gets the article
prepped and ready.

52:47.642 --> 52:48.817
Yeah.

52:48.904 --> 52:50.341
[loud thump]

52:51.429 --> 52:52.865
Uh-huh.

52:54.258 --> 52:55.476
Honestly?

52:55.563 --> 52:56.738
[scoffs]

52:56.825 --> 52:58.218
He's really shaken up.

52:59.524 --> 53:01.569
More so than
with previous incidents.

53:02.570 --> 53:04.485
Mm-hmm. Right.

53:04.572 --> 53:06.748
I mean it's suicide.
It's not a thunderstorm.

53:06.835 --> 53:08.359
It's not exactly
predictable.

53:25.941 --> 53:27.378
[beeps]

53:47.659 --> 53:49.095
[loud thumping]

53:52.707 --> 53:54.143
Hello?

54:01.325 --> 54:02.804
Josephine?

54:17.079 --> 54:18.385
[loud crash]

54:26.175 --> 54:27.481
[loud crashing]

54:53.420 --> 54:55.117
[Josephine] And what'd you do
with the body?

54:56.205 --> 54:57.946
[sighing]
Great.

54:59.470 --> 55:00.862
[Dylan]
Josephine?

55:00.949 --> 55:02.255
Just a second.

55:04.039 --> 55:07.782
Listen, if we're doing this,
we have to do it tomorrow.

55:07.869 --> 55:09.393
[Josephine chuckles]

55:09.480 --> 55:11.133
No, bring your gun.

55:11.220 --> 55:12.961
Well, you know, how our little
Dream Catcher can be

55:13.048 --> 55:14.180
when he gets angry.

55:14.267 --> 55:16.574
Yeah. Okay, bye.

55:16.661 --> 55:18.010
[inhales deeply]

55:19.011 --> 55:20.708
Dylan.

55:21.753 --> 55:23.581
I thought you were steaming.

55:23.668 --> 55:27.106
I was, until you came up and
tried to dick around with me.

55:27.193 --> 55:29.326
I've been on the phone.

55:30.805 --> 55:32.154
It's just your imagination.

55:32.241 --> 55:34.026
You're tired,
you're emotional.

55:34.113 --> 55:37.377
But that crowd, oh!

55:37.464 --> 55:38.944
[laughs]
You...

55:39.031 --> 55:40.902
you outshined everyone.

55:40.989 --> 55:42.382
What did you do
with Pierce?

55:42.469 --> 55:44.645
And that DJ Trek.

55:44.732 --> 55:47.387
You know, he's good.
Do you know who reps him?

55:47.474 --> 55:49.737
Jo, I don't think inviting
her friends over tomorrow night

55:49.824 --> 55:52.436
for the event
is a good idea.

55:52.523 --> 55:53.959
Oh.

55:54.046 --> 55:56.788
It is not your job to think.

55:56.875 --> 56:00.792
Your job is to drop beats,
spin music

56:00.879 --> 56:03.098
and make the world believe
your life is nothing

56:03.185 --> 56:05.318
but a panty-dropping party.

56:05.405 --> 56:08.234
Don't you remember
when you couldn't book a club,

56:08.321 --> 56:10.628
not a wedding, not a low-rent
birthday party

56:10.715 --> 56:13.152
with fake Disney
princesses?

56:13.239 --> 56:14.849
I did that.

56:14.936 --> 56:17.069
-I created you.
-You're wrong.

56:17.156 --> 56:19.027
I created myself.

56:19.114 --> 56:21.813
Then why am I cleaning up
all your messes?

56:21.900 --> 56:26.295
You're cocky, you're sloppy,
and you're lucky

56:26.383 --> 56:28.167
that you keep checks
coming in.

56:29.473 --> 56:31.910
Don't challenge
my decisions.

56:31.997 --> 56:35.435
I could end you
just as fast as I created you.

56:40.527 --> 56:42.268
Who were you on the phone to?

56:42.355 --> 56:44.749
And why would they need
to bring a gun?

56:44.836 --> 56:46.577
I was on the phone
with your manager,

56:46.664 --> 56:48.187
making sure everything
from tonight

56:48.274 --> 56:49.449
had been taken care of.

56:49.536 --> 56:50.929
[sighs]

56:51.016 --> 56:52.452
And the gun?

56:53.453 --> 56:56.064
Well, this is America.

56:56.151 --> 56:57.588
[chuckles]

56:57.675 --> 56:59.372
More trigger-happy than ISIS.

56:59.459 --> 57:02.767
And it is my job
to ensure your protection.

57:02.854 --> 57:04.943
Now, get some sleep.

57:05.030 --> 57:06.988
Tomorrow is a very big night.

57:57.299 --> 57:58.910
[sighing]

58:04.568 --> 58:05.960
Hey.

58:07.919 --> 58:09.311
Hey.

58:09.398 --> 58:11.009
-You okay?
-[sniffles]

58:11.966 --> 58:13.272
No.

58:16.057 --> 58:18.756
Do you want me
to call someone?

58:18.843 --> 58:20.453
It's not like that.

58:24.370 --> 58:25.719
You can talk to me.

58:30.028 --> 58:32.378
"Life is but a walking shadow...

58:34.859 --> 58:37.122
"a poor player
who struts and frets

58:37.209 --> 58:40.386
"his hour upon the stage,

58:40.473 --> 58:42.301
"and is heard no more.

58:46.523 --> 58:49.090
"It's a tale told by an idiot...

58:52.311 --> 58:55.009
"full of sound and fury,

58:55.096 --> 58:57.316
signifying nothing."

59:01.450 --> 59:02.582
That makes no sense to me.

59:02.669 --> 59:03.931
[chuckles]

59:04.932 --> 59:06.368
It's from "Macbeth."

59:07.326 --> 59:08.501
Oh.

59:08.588 --> 59:09.981
[sniffles]

59:10.068 --> 59:12.636
Pierce and I were both
in high school.

59:14.507 --> 59:17.858
I was a senior
and she was a freshman.

59:20.905 --> 59:24.256
She wanted to be
Lady Macbeth so bad,

59:24.343 --> 59:26.345
but I got the part.

59:28.956 --> 59:31.698
She played a witch.

59:36.137 --> 59:39.271
And she took it so,
so seriously.

59:43.405 --> 59:48.585
Her room was filled with books
on the occult and demonology.

59:51.239 --> 59:52.806
She laughed
at all the other kids

59:52.893 --> 59:55.504
that thought that Harry Potter
was real magic.

59:55.592 --> 59:57.071
[chuckles]

59:57.158 --> 59:58.682
-[loud crash]
-[gasps]

59:58.769 --> 1:00:00.074
What was that?

1:00:01.293 --> 1:00:03.251
[door creaking open]

1:00:06.603 --> 1:00:08.126
You think it's coming
from the foyer?

1:00:08.213 --> 1:00:09.954
[objects crash]

1:00:10.041 --> 1:00:11.477
Well, I'll follow your lead,

1:00:11.564 --> 1:00:13.653
because I'm the endearing
friend.

1:00:13.740 --> 1:00:14.959
I'm bound to die first.

1:00:15.046 --> 1:00:16.351
[whispers]
Would you be quiet?

1:00:16.438 --> 1:00:18.440
-[ice machine whirs]
-[gasps]

1:00:18.527 --> 1:00:19.920
Oh, shit.

1:00:24.098 --> 1:00:25.491
Anything?

1:00:29.713 --> 1:00:30.888
Hello?

1:00:30.975 --> 1:00:32.454
Who says, "hello"?

1:00:32.541 --> 1:00:35.283
Shut up. Just shut up.
Shut up.

1:00:35.370 --> 1:00:37.198
-[sighs]
-God.

1:00:37.285 --> 1:00:38.678
[loud roar]

1:00:38.765 --> 1:00:40.637
[indistinct whispering]

1:00:49.950 --> 1:00:51.865
Ah! Dude!

1:00:51.952 --> 1:00:53.780
Oh, my God,
you scared the shit out of me.

1:00:53.867 --> 1:00:55.260
I nearly hit you
in the face.

1:00:55.347 --> 1:00:57.262
Overreacting again.

1:00:57.349 --> 1:00:58.872
Jesus Christ, Jake,
where have you been?

1:00:58.959 --> 1:01:00.221
Was that you the whole time?

1:01:00.308 --> 1:01:01.962
I couldn't sleep.

1:01:02.049 --> 1:01:04.530
-I went for a run...
-Sit down.

1:01:04.617 --> 1:01:07.011
...and I tripped
into some bushes.

1:01:07.098 --> 1:01:08.665
[Jake gasps]

1:01:08.752 --> 1:01:10.797
-I thought you were asthmatic.
-[Jake grunts]

1:01:10.884 --> 1:01:12.799
That's why I tripped.

1:34:07.163 --> 1:34:08.643
Fuck.

1:34:10.340 --> 1:34:12.516
We got to get out of here.

1:34:12.603 --> 1:34:14.518
[inaudible chatter]

1:34:17.695 --> 1:34:19.088
[Jake]
Holy shit! Fuck!

1:34:19.175 --> 1:34:20.611
Go, go, go!

1:34:27.574 --> 1:34:30.360
The last few days have been
pretty rough for me.

1:34:30.447 --> 1:34:33.668
You guys weren't even
in the equation.

1:34:33.755 --> 1:34:36.409
I just wanted
to axe my fucking team.

1:34:38.063 --> 1:34:41.110
You know, they wanted
to throw me under the bus,

1:34:41.197 --> 1:34:44.591
and we know how ravenous
the media can be.

1:34:44.679 --> 1:34:47.029
You know, you're playing
sold-out venues,

1:34:47.116 --> 1:34:50.032
you're drinking
thousand-dollar champagne.

1:34:51.424 --> 1:34:53.862
And one allegation...

1:34:53.949 --> 1:34:55.211
one video...

1:34:55.298 --> 1:34:56.516
Yeah, I know.

1:34:56.603 --> 1:34:57.996
...one misplaced tweet,

1:34:58.083 --> 1:34:59.694
and you're at
the fucking bottom!

1:35:00.651 --> 1:35:01.957
You're...

1:35:02.044 --> 1:35:03.872
Insane?

1:35:05.569 --> 1:35:08.267
We kind of have to be
to be in this industry.

1:35:09.312 --> 1:35:11.270
On display 24/7.

1:35:12.271 --> 1:35:13.490
Fuck.

1:35:13.577 --> 1:35:16.406
Scrutinized, dissected.

1:35:18.625 --> 1:35:20.192
Held to some--

1:35:20.279 --> 1:35:23.543
Some strange
unobtainable standard.

1:35:26.024 --> 1:35:29.027
You know, I've done some shit
to get to where I am today,

1:35:29.114 --> 1:35:32.378
and I can't have people
trying to steal that rug

1:35:32.465 --> 1:35:35.077
from underneath me,
now can I?

1:35:35.164 --> 1:35:36.643
Your sister, though...

1:35:36.731 --> 1:35:38.602
[inhales sharply]

1:35:38.689 --> 1:35:41.126
...she was a wild card.

1:35:42.911 --> 1:35:45.043
-An unexpected hang-up.
-[Jake] Come on, man, just--

1:35:45.130 --> 1:35:46.436
She--

1:35:46.523 --> 1:35:48.307
-Shut the fuck up!
-[Jake grunts]

1:35:49.526 --> 1:35:51.354
[Ivy breathing heavily]

1:35:51.441 --> 1:35:54.923
She-- She-- She saw
through my soul.

1:35:55.010 --> 1:35:57.839
You know, I--
I really believed that.

1:36:00.363 --> 1:36:03.018
We had a real--
A real twin flames moment.

1:36:04.541 --> 1:36:08.588
You know, broken people
attract broken people.

1:36:10.373 --> 1:36:11.678
Wouldn't you agree?

1:36:11.766 --> 1:36:13.463
[breathing heavily]

1:36:13.550 --> 1:36:15.378
[Jake] You think you're going
to get away with this?

1:36:15.465 --> 1:36:16.858
Ah, there it is.

1:36:16.945 --> 1:36:18.294
[chuckles]

1:36:18.381 --> 1:36:20.078
There it is.

1:36:21.123 --> 1:36:22.341
[exhales]

1:36:22.428 --> 1:36:24.039
The question.

1:36:27.564 --> 1:36:29.348
Yes. Yes, I am.

1:36:31.176 --> 1:36:33.135
Now, Josephine...

1:36:33.222 --> 1:36:35.833
you know, her evidence
she had against me,

1:36:35.920 --> 1:36:39.358
I'll use as proof
for her obscure

1:36:39.445 --> 1:36:41.839
and dangerous obsession.

1:36:43.449 --> 1:36:46.104
Now, after covering up
a suicide...

1:36:47.584 --> 1:36:49.412
she hunted down the witnesses

1:36:49.499 --> 1:36:51.718
to tie up
those loose ends.

1:36:53.372 --> 1:36:55.374
And I'll be playing
Vegas on Friday,

1:36:55.461 --> 1:36:57.463
and I'll be through
on Sunday.

1:36:58.900 --> 1:37:00.727
[gunshot]

1:37:00.815 --> 1:37:03.600
Fat chance, asshole.

1:37:03.687 --> 1:37:05.428
You...

1:37:05.515 --> 1:37:08.561
Oh, you have always
been a little shit.

1:37:08.648 --> 1:37:11.695
But this?
Oh, this is next level.

1:37:11.782 --> 1:37:13.305
Being an artist...

1:37:13.392 --> 1:37:15.133
constantly innovating.

1:37:15.220 --> 1:37:16.395
[chuckles]

1:37:16.482 --> 1:37:17.919
Oh, fuck you, Dylan.

1:37:18.006 --> 1:37:20.095
Go. Get out of here.

1:37:30.235 --> 1:37:32.150
[gasps and wheezes]

1:37:42.421 --> 1:37:43.640
[gasps]

1:37:43.727 --> 1:37:45.424
Pierce?

1:37:45.511 --> 1:37:47.992
We saw you die.

1:37:48.079 --> 1:37:52.214
[Pierce]
On one hand, there's a theory
how people are inherently good.

1:37:55.652 --> 1:37:57.436
And then on the other hand,

1:37:57.523 --> 1:37:59.264
there's the whole
of human history.

1:37:59.351 --> 1:38:00.700
[grunting]

1:38:00.787 --> 1:38:02.572
[coughs and gasps]

1:38:08.883 --> 1:38:10.449
[gasps]

1:38:10.536 --> 1:38:12.234
Oh, my God.

1:38:12.321 --> 1:38:14.149
This is impossible.

1:38:15.846 --> 1:38:17.587
Yet here I am.

1:38:19.154 --> 1:38:20.416
You're a murderer?

1:38:20.503 --> 1:38:21.939
An accomplice.

1:38:24.855 --> 1:38:27.858
The best things come in twos.

1:38:29.381 --> 1:38:31.253
Dylan showed me a world...

1:38:32.558 --> 1:38:33.820
that wasn't...

1:38:35.344 --> 1:38:36.867
[sighs]
...what was holding me back.

1:38:36.954 --> 1:38:39.174
[Ivy, sobbing]
Please stop, Pierce.

1:38:39.261 --> 1:38:40.871
And importantly...

1:38:42.873 --> 1:38:44.919
he gave me a second chance
at life.

1:38:47.443 --> 1:38:48.923
[gasps]

1:38:50.011 --> 1:38:51.751
I loved you.

1:38:51.838 --> 1:38:54.406
Sometimes that's just not
good enough.

1:38:55.668 --> 1:38:57.583
-[knife pierces]
-[gasps and sobs]

1:38:58.976 --> 1:39:02.023
I'm a fucking ghost now!

1:39:02.110 --> 1:39:04.634
There are no secrets
for me anymore.

1:39:04.721 --> 1:39:06.244
This isn't you.

1:39:06.331 --> 1:39:08.072
I know it isn't you.

1:39:08.159 --> 1:39:09.508
[grunts]

1:39:12.120 --> 1:39:13.643
[Ivy]
What are you doing?

1:39:24.480 --> 1:39:27.831
I appreciated your plan
for revenge, Ivy.

1:39:29.659 --> 1:39:34.620
Surprising to actually see
my big sister

1:39:34.707 --> 1:39:36.971
stand up for me for once.

1:39:38.755 --> 1:39:40.322
Let's see you come back
from that, bitch.

1:39:40.409 --> 1:39:41.845
-No, no!
-[gunshot]

1:39:41.932 --> 1:39:43.716
[Ivy gasps]

1:39:45.457 --> 1:39:47.155
[sighs]

1:39:48.199 --> 1:39:50.549
[Ivy]
What the fuck?

1:39:52.116 --> 1:39:53.988
[breathing heavily]

1:39:56.425 --> 1:39:58.427
What the fuck?

1:39:58.514 --> 1:40:00.690
-What the fuck?
-[exhaling]

1:40:02.866 --> 1:40:04.389
What is wrong with you two?

1:40:07.131 --> 1:40:11.527
I guess you weren't too far off
with the sociopathic floodgate.

1:40:14.138 --> 1:40:15.618
[Dylan]
Oh.

1:40:19.274 --> 1:40:21.058
Selling your soul
to the devil...

1:40:23.365 --> 1:40:24.931
does come with its perks.

1:40:26.150 --> 1:40:28.935
A favor here,
a favor there,

1:40:29.023 --> 1:40:30.807
say a...

1:40:32.330 --> 1:40:33.679
a ghostly companion.

1:40:37.074 --> 1:40:39.468
If I'm going to be
eternally damned...

1:40:41.383 --> 1:40:44.342
you better believe I'm gonna
get all the upgrades I can.

1:40:45.952 --> 1:40:48.999
It wasn't too long ago
you wanted to die, Ivy.

1:40:51.784 --> 1:40:54.048
Who better to help you
than me?

1:40:58.443 --> 1:41:00.532
"Life has been
a walking shadow.

1:41:02.360 --> 1:41:04.493
"A poor player who struts

1:41:04.580 --> 1:41:07.235
"and frets his hour
upon the stage...

1:41:08.497 --> 1:41:10.412
and is heard no more."

1:41:16.505 --> 1:41:20.378
"It is a tale
told by an idiot...

1:41:22.989 --> 1:41:26.863
full of sound and fury..."

1:41:26.950 --> 1:41:28.734
[Ivy sobbing]

1:41:34.131 --> 1:41:35.350
"...signifying nothing."

[Ivy whimpers]

1:41:44.359 --> 1:41:45.925
[body thuds]

1:41:50.365 --> 1:41:52.149
[gasps softly]

1:44:47.759 --> 1:44:49.544
Hey, Dylan, I'm--

1:44:49.631 --> 1:44:51.415
I'm sorry I passed out
on the piano last night.

1:44:51.502 --> 1:44:53.591
[laughs]
It was crazy.

1:44:54.810 --> 1:44:56.377
Who were you talking to?

1:44:56.464 --> 1:44:58.770
-[blade pierces]
-[gasps and coughs]

1:45:00.206 --> 1:45:02.034
-[blade rings]
-[body thuds]
