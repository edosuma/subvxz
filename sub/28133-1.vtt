11:02.872 --> 11:03.873

11:04.915 --> 11:07.334

Yeah, he'll do it.

11:07.877 --> 11:09.628
(CHUCKLES) What?
(COUGHS)

11:09.712 --> 11:10.713

11:11.380 --> 11:12.381

11:13.007 --> 11:14.050
Hang on, Glen.

11:14.675 --> 11:17.053
(SIGHS) Glen wants
to know if, uh...

11:18.304 --> 11:19.889
(STRAINING)
If you'll do one of these,

11:22.933 --> 11:23.934
in the willy.

11:24.018 --> 11:25.644
Ricky, you kidding me, mate?

11:25.728 --> 11:26.937
Breathe in.
All right.

11:27.063 --> 11:29.231
When you release it,
I'll pop it in.
All right.

11:29.315 --> 11:30.357
Ready?
All right.

11:30.441 --> 11:32.443

11:32.943 --> 11:34.236
(GROANING LOUDLY)

11:37.031 --> 11:38.365
It's a unique sensation.

11:38.449 --> 11:39.617
You all right?

11:39.700 --> 11:41.285
Don't... Don't touch me.
All right.

11:43.287 --> 11:44.497
Hang on, Glen.

11:45.956 --> 11:47.249
Go on. Yeah.
Yeah?

11:48.084 --> 11:50.669
Glen? Yeah, he'll take
a bowling ball
in the bollocks.

11:52.088 --> 11:53.172
Sixty quid?

11:54.340 --> 11:56.092
Glen, mate, you're killing me.

11:56.842 --> 11:59.178
It's not gonna be worth him
making the trip for that.

11:59.261 --> 12:03.057
I don't wanna see that, right?
I don't wanna see that.

12:03.140 --> 12:04.600
Just a nice clean headlock,

12:04.683 --> 12:06.143
straight into position.
Understood?

12:06.227 --> 12:08.312
ALL: Yes, coach!
Great, okay.

12:10.022 --> 12:11.702
All right, Cal.
You getting in, then, mate?

12:11.774 --> 12:13.734
Uh, no, thanks.
I just come here
for the smells.

12:13.818 --> 12:15.170
You're a teenager
and you're blind.

12:15.194 --> 12:17.530
What else are you
gonna do today?
Listen to porn?

12:17.613 --> 12:19.532

All right, seriously,
how's he gonna wrestle?

12:28.707 --> 12:29.959
No idea.

12:31.085 --> 12:32.711
What did we do last night, babe?

12:34.255 --> 12:35.256
400.

12:35.339 --> 12:36.465
Bloody hell.

12:37.174 --> 12:39.814
If things don't pick up soon,
I'm gonna have to
go back to thieving.

12:40.636 --> 12:42.221
I don't care
how desperate things get,

12:42.304 --> 12:43.532
you're not going back
to thieving.

12:43.556 --> 12:44.557
You're not.

12:45.349 --> 12:46.433
Zak can do it.

12:46.517 --> 12:48.060
Raya can go on the game.
(CHUCKLES)

12:49.687 --> 12:51.105
We're gonna be all right.

12:51.981 --> 12:53.649

Yeah.

12:53.732 --> 12:55.651
Three and turn.

12:55.734 --> 12:59.822
ALL: One, two,
three and turn.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.658
Oh, can me and Courtney
have a word?

13:02.741 --> 13:04.368
Yeah. Sure.
Great.

(INAUDIBLE)
(ALL CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)

ZAK: I'm not asking us to
bow and scrape or nothing.

13:15.254 --> 13:16.589
I'm just saying that, you know,

13:16.672 --> 13:19.842
Courtney's parents
are a bit...
You know, what's the word?

13:19.925 --> 13:21.010
Posh?

13:21.093 --> 13:22.094
Classy.

13:22.553 --> 13:23.888
Her dad's teetotal.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.181
So am I.

13:25.264 --> 13:28.142
Yeah, but he's teetotal
out of choice, Dad.
Not 'cause he's an alcoholic.

13:28.225 --> 13:29.435
(MURMURING) La-Di-da.

13:29.518 --> 13:31.020
You want us
to make a good impression.

13:31.103 --> 13:32.104
Yes.
Yeah?

13:32.188 --> 13:34.124
A good impression how?
Well, can he put a shirt on?

13:34.148 --> 13:36.483
A shirt on?
How bloody posh are they?

13:36.567 --> 13:37.651
That's another thing.

13:37.735 --> 13:39.778
Courtney's dad,
he don't swear, apparently.

13:39.862 --> 13:41.989
So let's just keep
the effing and jeffing

13:42.072 --> 13:43.133
down to a minimum, please.
RICKY: Ugh!

13:43.157 --> 13:46.744
Unbelievable! Who is her dad?
The Archbishop of shitting

13:48.162 --> 13:49.163
Kent?

13:49.246 --> 13:50.831
What did I just say?

13:50.915 --> 13:52.374
Raya, help me out.

13:52.458 --> 13:54.585
Look, he wants
to make a good impression

13:54.668 --> 13:57.796
because Courtney's great,
and he loves her,

13:57.880 --> 13:59.048
and he respects her...

13:59.131 --> 14:00.424
And he got her up the duff.

14:00.507 --> 14:01.842
I didn't get her up the duff.

14:01.926 --> 14:03.469
It's known
as an unplanned pregnancy.

14:03.552 --> 14:05.137
All pregnancies
are unplanned, son.

14:05.763 --> 14:07.014
Whatever happens tonight,

14:07.097 --> 14:08.307
it will never be as bad

14:08.390 --> 14:10.118
as when you went on
in King's Lynn
wearing his shorts.

14:10.142 --> 14:12.645
Oh, yeah, your little willy
fell out. (CHUCKLES)

14:12.728 --> 14:14.730
"Little"? Why would
you say little?

14:14.813 --> 14:16.482
Big enough to get Courtney
up the duff.

14:16.565 --> 14:18.108
Ugh, that is gross.

14:18.192 --> 14:19.568
Look, for Courtney's sake,

14:19.652 --> 14:21.904
let's all just try and act
a little bit normal.

14:21.987 --> 14:23.280
All right.
Okay.

14:23.364 --> 14:24.448
Dad?

14:25.032 --> 14:27.076
Yes, I will behave.

14:27.159 --> 14:28.202
Thank you.

14:32.247 --> 14:34.291
May I just say my, uh...
My husband and I

14:34.375 --> 14:36.669
are delighted to finally
make your acquaintance.

14:36.752 --> 14:39.254
Absolutely, and likewise.

14:39.755 --> 14:43.008
Courtney tells us
that you're all,
um, wrestlers.

14:43.509 --> 14:45.070
JULIA: Yeah, whole family.
RICKY: Yup. Yes, yes, we are.

14:45.094 --> 14:46.178
Whole family of wrestlers.

14:46.261 --> 14:47.301
And our half-brother, Roy.

14:47.930 --> 14:48.990
DAPHNE: So, who...
(CLEARS THROAT)

14:49.014 --> 14:50.599
What sort of people
enjoy wrestling?

14:50.683 --> 14:51.725
That's a good question.

14:52.601 --> 14:54.228
I mean, it's all fake anyway,
isn't it?

14:55.688 --> 14:56.689
Come again?

14:56.772 --> 14:58.816
It's not fake, it's fixed.

14:58.899 --> 14:59.900
Yeah, if it was fake,

14:59.984 --> 15:02.111
would I have broken
half the parts
of my body deaf?

15:02.194 --> 15:03.612
His left leg bends both ways.

15:03.696 --> 15:05.090
Well, that's nothing.
You should see his cock.

15:09.201 --> 15:10.202
Sorry.

15:10.285 --> 15:12.079
Penis, you should see his penis.

15:17.501 --> 15:19.187
Do you have a...
Have you got
another question or...

15:19.211 --> 15:20.212
I can, yes.

15:20.295 --> 15:22.589
How... How did you
get into wrestling?

15:22.673 --> 15:24.425
It's quite a romantic story.

15:24.508 --> 15:26.427
We like romantic stories,
so...
JULIA: Aww.

15:26.510 --> 15:27.830
Right, well,
you'll like this one.

15:28.554 --> 15:30.198
Well, when I met Rick,
I was thinking
of killing meself.

15:30.222 --> 15:31.223
Pills.

15:32.683 --> 15:35.978
I was, uh, homeless, abused,
living on the street,
you know.

15:36.645 --> 15:37.646
Yep.

15:37.730 --> 15:39.857
I myself had done, uh,
eight years in prison.

15:39.940 --> 15:40.983
Prison?

15:41.066 --> 15:43.027
(HUGH CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

15:43.110 --> 15:44.236
What was that for?

15:44.319 --> 15:46.196
Mainly violence.
Mainly violence, yeah.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.281
Bit of armed robbery.

15:47.823 --> 15:48.866
RICKY: You know?
HUGH: Mmm.

15:48.949 --> 15:51.761
JULIA: Anyway, I came back
to the flat one night,
and there was, uh, guns,

15:51.785 --> 15:53.037
money on the table, everything.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.597
Sorry, there was guns and...
JULIA: Money.

15:54.621 --> 15:55.981
Guns and money, right.
JULIA: Yeah.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.082
Done a job, hadn't you?

15:57.166 --> 15:58.375
And I looked at him...

15:58.459 --> 16:00.169
The look said, essentially,

16:00.252 --> 16:01.545
"Ricky, turn your back on crime.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.273
"Otherwise, I'm gonna
turn my back on you."

16:03.297 --> 16:04.631
And he did.
That's what I did.

16:04.715 --> 16:05.716
Never looked back.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.843
Some people find religion,
but wrestling...

16:07.926 --> 16:09.863
We found wrestling, didn't we?
It was our salvation.

16:09.887 --> 16:11.180
We found each other and all.

16:11.263 --> 16:12.264
Yeah.

Oh...
It's the pinnacle. Okay?

It's... It's something
that we have wished for

18:07.296 --> 18:08.672

stepped in the ring.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.424
And Zak's got it all worked out.

18:10.507 --> 18:12.634
We'd get a big villa in Florida.

19:09.608 --> 19:12.819
When Roy didn't get signed,
he, uh, didn't
take it too well.

19:12.903 --> 19:14.821
He started drinking,
picking fights.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.910
He threw a chunk of tarmac
at a bloke's head,
put him in a coma.

19:23.914 --> 19:26.083
Look. Zak's not Roy.

19:26.500 --> 19:27.918
And he's gonna make
you and Courtney

19:28.001 --> 19:30.003
the most proud people
in the world.

19:30.921 --> 19:32.631
I know this
'cause he's my brother.

19:33.966 --> 19:35.550
You can trust me.

19:43.392 --> 19:44.768
(PANTING)

19:47.896 --> 19:50.899
My name's Zak Zodiac.
When I was three years old,

19:51.358 --> 19:54.987
I could name
every WWE wrestler just by
looking at his boots.

19:56.280 --> 19:57.489
Zak Zodiac.

19:57.572 --> 19:59.783
Every wrestler
just by looking at his boots.

19:59.866 --> 20:02.160
When I was three years old,
I could name...

20:04.288 --> 20:05.330
You all right?

20:07.207 --> 20:08.917
All right. What's wrong?

20:09.501 --> 20:10.877
I know when you're lying.

20:13.547 --> 20:15.173
This is our shot, Zak.

20:17.009 --> 20:18.010
I know.

20:19.678 --> 20:21.263
But what if I screw up?

20:21.346 --> 20:22.347
You won't.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.601
Come on. You're gonna
smash it tomorrow.

20:26.685 --> 20:27.769
How do you know?

20:27.853 --> 20:29.062
Because you're a Knight.

20:29.771 --> 20:31.273
Wrestling's in your blood.

20:31.648 --> 20:33.817
That's not good.
That makes it sound
like hepatitis.

20:35.068 --> 20:36.069
Yeah, it is.

20:36.611 --> 20:38.322
We're riddled with wrestling.

20:44.494 --> 20:45.495
Okay.

We're here for the tryout.

21:04.765 --> 21:05.807
ZAK: Great.

21:05.891 --> 21:07.410
Sorry. We're here
for the tryouts.
Tryouts that way?

What's up, Zak?

22:03.990 --> 22:05.843

to meet you, mate.
Oh, thanks, Zak.

Yeah, we've been fans
since you had hair.

Oh, thank you.
Hey, it's a choice.

22:14.876 --> 22:15.937

A damn good one, too.

22:15.961 --> 22:18.314

Are you getting back
in the ring?

You wrestling again?
Uh, no. No, no, no.

22:25.262 --> 22:26.489
I'm just shooting a movie
here in London,

22:26.513 --> 22:29.182

surprise the crowd tonight.
Gonna electrify.

to one of our shows.

get him on the list.

I'll be able

Shut your mouth!

23:37.167 --> 23:40.045
What you want? What you want?
How about what The Rock wants?

23:40.128 --> 23:42.214
The Rock wants you
to go out there,
take no prisoners,

23:42.297 --> 23:44.049
have no regrets, have no fear.

23:44.132 --> 23:45.800
Lay it all out on the line.

23:45.884 --> 23:46.944
Because if you don't do that,

23:46.968 --> 23:48.848
The Rock is gonna find
your friend Mary Poppins.

23:48.887 --> 23:50.096
He's gonna take her umbrella.

23:50.180 --> 23:51.532
Yeah, he's gonna
shine it up real nice.

23:51.556 --> 23:53.036
He's gonna turn
that sumbitch sideways

23:53.099 --> 23:55.185
and stick it straight
up your candy asses!

23:55.268 --> 23:56.478
There's your advice!

23:56.561 --> 23:58.522
Straight out
of the Jabroni-beating,

you win over the crowd.

is a fictionalized world,

if you're not being real.

Come on, let's go.

24:53.868 --> 24:56.621
To be a WWE superstar,
you have to have two things.

24:56.705 --> 24:58.623
Number one, you gotta
have the skills,

24:58.707 --> 25:00.387
and number two,
you have to have the spark.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.027
Now, skills,
that's obvious, right?

25:02.085 --> 25:03.420
You gotta be able to wrestle.

25:03.503 --> 25:05.922
The spark, well,

25:06.381 --> 25:07.924
that's the magic dust.

25:08.008 --> 25:10.010
It's what the audience
falls in love with.

25:10.385 --> 25:12.429
It's why they buy your poster.

25:12.512 --> 25:13.864
It's why they come back
every week.

25:13.888 --> 25:15.140
It's why they chant your name.

25:15.223 --> 25:19.352
It's why they buy
a six-inch action figure
of you.

25:20.020 --> 25:24.107
Do you see yourself
as a six-inch action figure?

25:24.190 --> 25:27.193
Yeah. Yes, I do.
I see myself as WWE champion.

25:27.277 --> 25:28.862
Ding, ding, ding!
Bingo, guys.

25:28.945 --> 25:31.197
That's exactly right.
That's called
a great attitude.

25:31.281 --> 25:32.616
And that's a big plate of yes.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.284
That is one
of the biggest requirements

25:34.367 --> 25:36.953
that you have to have
to be a WWE superstar.

25:37.037 --> 25:38.788
And you don't have
any of the other things.

25:38.872 --> 25:41.041
But the attitude's
the one thing
you're in control over,

25:41.124 --> 25:43.084
and the attitude's
the one thing that you have.

25:43.501 --> 25:44.544

25:49.090 --> 25:50.258
(LIGHT LAUGHTER)

25:50.467 --> 25:51.635
Why do you wanna wrestle?

25:52.427 --> 25:55.513
I wanna be a wrestler
because since I was
three years old,

25:55.597 --> 25:57.432
I could name
every single WWE wrestler

25:57.515 --> 25:58.892
just by looking at their boots.

25:59.392 --> 26:00.832
And I've wanted to be one
ever since.

26:01.061 --> 26:03.313
I'm passionate, I'm determined,

26:03.396 --> 26:07.025
and I'm the toughest bastard
in any room,

26:07.108 --> 26:08.526
including this one.

26:08.610 --> 26:09.778
Probably shouldn't swear,

26:09.861 --> 26:11.404
not when there's ladies present.

26:11.946 --> 26:14.032
Sorry, miss.
Sorry about that.

26:21.456 --> 26:22.558
Do you not remember your name?

26:22.582 --> 26:24.727
No, I do. It's just they...
They asked me to change it.

26:24.751 --> 26:25.978
Do you remember
what you changed it to?

26:26.002 --> 26:27.337
Yeah.
Okay, that's good.

26:27.420 --> 26:28.421
What is it?

26:28.505 --> 26:30.840
Uh, Paige.
As a wrestling name, Paige?

26:31.174 --> 26:32.175
Yeah.

26:32.258 --> 26:33.760
"Paige" feels a little more

26:33.843 --> 26:36.304
like she might work
at the perfume counter
at the mall.

26:36.388 --> 26:38.282
Like... (MIMICS SPRAYING)
"Do you want a free sample?"

26:38.306 --> 26:39.599
No, Paige is the name of a witch

26:39.683 --> 26:40.934
from a TV show that I like.

26:41.351 --> 26:43.511
So you liked the name
off the show
and then you took it?

26:44.062 --> 26:45.063
Yeah.

26:48.817 --> 26:50.985

little British girl wrestle.

26:52.904 --> 26:55.115
Yeah, well,
not all British girls
are timid.

26:55.782 --> 26:58.159
Just like not all Americans
are arrogant wankers.

26:59.953 --> 27:01.329
Just saying.

27:02.580 --> 27:03.957
Why do you wanna wrestle, Paige?

27:04.040 --> 27:07.460
Been wrestling since I was 13.
My whole family wrestles.

27:07.544 --> 27:09.212
But why do you wanna wrestle?

27:09.295 --> 27:11.965
Been wrestling since I was 13.
My whole family wrestles.

27:12.048 --> 27:13.842
But why do you wanna wrestle?

27:16.803 --> 27:17.929
Um...

27:20.181 --> 27:21.558
It's an escape, isn't it?

27:22.475 --> 27:23.810

flowing together,

27:29.899 --> 27:32.318
it feels like
the world just disappears.

like I belong somewhere.

Maybe he'd get a shot
at a pay-per-view event.

And he would try so hard
to make an impression,

01:02:01.385 --> 01:02:03.137

Your wrestling career
is over."

01:02:16.692 --> 01:02:18.444
But why quit then?
He wouldn't stop.

01:02:18.528 --> 01:02:21.489
So then the wife
would leave him
and take the kid.

01:02:21.572 --> 01:02:23.133
And then he would just keep
chasing the pipe dream,

01:02:23.157 --> 01:02:26.369

4,000 miles away
