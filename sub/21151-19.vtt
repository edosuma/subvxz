>> PREVIOUSLY ON "BIG BROTHER"!
MARK AND JOSH BECAME BITTER

00:06.974 --> 00:07.908
ENEMIES.

00:07.941 --> 00:13.814
>> NO!
>> AND AFTER JOSH'S CONSTANT

00:13.847 --> 00:21.689
TAUNTING -- MARK, BIG BROTHER
HOUSE!

00:21.722 --> 00:28.129
>> THEIR FEUD REACHED A BOILING
POINT.

00:28.162 --> 00:33.567
>> WITH PAUL IN CONTROL --
>> CONGRATULATIONS, PAUL!

00:33.601 --> 00:35.803
YOU'RE THE NEW HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD!

00:35.836 --> 00:39.607
>> JESS USED THE POWER TO KEEP
HER AND CODY SAFE.

00:39.640 --> 00:42.443
>> I'M HAPPY THAT AMERICAN
DECIDED TO GIVE ME THE FINAL

00:42.476 --> 00:46.747
TEMPTATION AND I HAVE THE POWER
TO KEEP CODY AND I SAFE A FEW

00:46.780 --> 00:47.748
WEEKS.

00:47.781 --> 00:49.783
>> SO PAUL THEM ON THE BLOCK TO
CALL HER BLUFF.

00:49.817 --> 00:53.287
>> I NOMINATED YOU, JESSICA AND
YOU, CODY.

00:53.321 --> 01:00.461
THE FACT THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN
REVEALED, WE'RE GENUINELY

01:00.494 --> 01:01.562
CONFUSED.

01:01.595 --> 01:04.598
>> AT THE LIVE EVICTION, JESS
REVEALED HER HEX APPEAL.

01:04.632 --> 01:09.270
>> WELL, HOUSE GUESTS, ALL OF
YOU HAVE BEEN SO CURIOUS TO KNOW

01:09.303 --> 01:13.807
WHAT MY TEMPTATION IS, I'M
OFFICIALLY RELEASING THE HALTING

01:13.841 --> 01:14.808
HEX.

01:14.842 --> 01:18.612
>> AND ANY HOPES OF SENDING CODY
PACKING HALTED.

01:18.646 --> 01:23.151
>> SHE HAS STOPPED THIS EVICTION
AND NO ONE IS LEAVING THE HOUSE

01:23.184 --> 01:24.352
TONIGHT.

01:24.385 --> 01:28.422
JESSICA AND CODY ARE BOTH SAFE
AND STILL PLAYING THE "BIG

01:28.456 --> 01:30.424
BROTHER" GAME.

01:30.458 --> 01:35.663

ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.

01:54.915 --> 01:59.253

TEMPTED TO PLAY IN THE MOST

01:59.287 --> 02:03.357
FRIGHTENING COMPETITION OF ALL
TIME.

02:10.063 --> 02:13.033
>> HELLO, FRIENDS!

>> GOOD NIGHT, JULIE!

02:58.045 --> 03:01.148
>> YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, BABY.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.650
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, BABY.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.918
YOU'RE OKAY.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.053
>> YOU DID GOOD.

03:06.086 --> 03:09.290
>> IT'S BEEN A BATTLE FOR ME
UPHILL SINCE THE MOMENT I

03:09.323 --> 03:10.558
STEPPED INTO THIS HOUSE.

03:10.591 --> 03:14.828
I WAS INSTANTLY ISOLATED AND TO
BE HOH AND JUST HAVING THE POWER

03:14.862 --> 03:20.901
TO SEND ONE OF THESE PEOPLE HOME
THIS WEEK IS THE BEST THING EVER

03:20.934 --> 03:23.371
AND NOTHING WILL TOP THIS.

03:23.404 --> 03:27.641
>> THE WHOLE HOUSE HAS TEAMED UP
AGAINST ME AND JESSICA.

03:27.675 --> 03:34.682
NOW JOSH IS HOH -- NOT MUCH TO
SAY ABOUT THAT.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.984
>> I'M NOT READING MY LETTER.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.386
>> YOU HAVE TO.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.388
>> KEVIN IS READING IT.

03:40.421 --> 03:43.056
I'M NOT READING IT.
>> JOSH IS HOH.

03:43.090 --> 03:47.828
I KNOW I'M SAFE AND I KNOW
JESSICA AND CODY AREN'T.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.096
I FLUSH OUT THE HEX.

03:49.129 --> 03:55.035
NOW IT'S GAME ON WITH JESS AND
CODY ALL OVER AGAIN.

03:55.068 --> 03:58.939
>> GUESS WHO DOESN'T HAVE SAFETY
ANYMORE?

03:58.972 --> 04:01.975
>> JOSH, DO I HAVE TO WORRY?

04:02.009 --> 04:09.450
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
THINKING ABOUT.

04:09.483 --> 04:12.386
>> FOR NOW WE'RE CELEBRATING.

04:12.420 --> 04:15.989
>> JOSH IS VERY ERRATIC.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.358
WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING.

04:17.391 --> 04:19.627
I HAVE THROWN PICKLE JUICE IN
HIS FACE.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.562
A LOT OF POTS AND PANS.

04:21.595 --> 04:26.066
A FEW DAYS AGO, HE CAME TO ME
AND WE CLEARED THE AIR.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.034
>> I'M DONE.

04:27.067 --> 04:30.338
WE BOTH PROVOKED EACH OTHER.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.505
WE'RE BOTH GROWN MEN.

04:31.539 --> 04:33.140
I'M DONE WITH THE POTS AND PANS.

04:33.173 --> 04:34.608
I'M NOT A BULLY.

04:34.642 --> 04:38.646
I'M NOT GOING TO BEAT YOU UP
WHILE YOU'RE DONE.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.748
I DON'T FEEL GOOD DOING IT.

04:40.781 --> 04:41.915
I DON'T.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.485
FOR ME PERSONALLY, IF WE'RE
GOING TO PLAY THE GAME, LET'S

04:44.518 --> 04:45.553
PLAY THE GAME.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.321
ONE OF US WALKS OUT.

04:47.355 --> 04:50.858
I'M NOT GOING TO PROVOKE YOU
WHERE YOU WANT TO HATE ME AND

04:50.891 --> 04:51.992
KNOCK ME OUT.

04:52.025 --> 04:54.928
THAT'S A COWARD MOVE FROM MY
END.

04:54.962 --> 05:00.300
>> I APPRECIATE THAT, JOSH.

05:00.334 --> 05:01.735
WANT TO SIT DOWN?

05:01.769 --> 05:02.570
>> YES.

05:02.603 --> 05:03.837
>> THANK YOU.

05:03.871 --> 05:07.708
>> I'M JUST HOPING THAT THINGS
ARE COOL WITH US RIGHT NOW AND

05:07.741 --> 05:13.747
I'M OFF HIS RADAR.

05:13.781 --> 05:16.884
>> YOU BUMMED?

05:16.917 --> 05:23.090
>> I MEAN, I'M OKAY.

05:23.123 --> 05:24.525
>> IT'S ALL RIGHT.

05:24.558 --> 05:27.628
I JUST DIDN'T WANT THOSE IDIOTS
TO GET A VICTORY.

05:27.661 --> 05:31.231
>> FROM THE DUNGEON TO THE
PENTHOUSE, BABY.

05:31.264 --> 05:32.199
>> OH, GOD.

05:32.232 --> 05:34.034
I DON'T HAVE THE PATIENCE FOR
IT.

05:34.067 --> 05:37.371
>> IT'S STILL CODY AND I VERSUS
THE ENTIRE HOUSE.

05:37.405 --> 05:39.907
IT'S THE SAME SONG AND DANCE
EVERY DAY.

05:39.940 --> 05:47.247
HOW MANY DAYS DOES IT TAKE FOR
YOU TO EVICT US?

05:47.280 --> 05:52.986
>> I'M SO OVER THESE PEOPLE IN
THIS HOUSE.

05:53.020 --> 06:04.965
>> I'M ABOUT TO GO ON THE
BIGGEST POWER TRIP EVER.

06:04.998 --> 06:07.968
>> SHE COMES UP TO ME IN THE
KITCHEN.

06:08.001 --> 06:09.403
OH, LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

06:09.437 --> 06:10.538
IT'S LIKE OH, MY GOD.

06:10.571 --> 06:12.272
WE DON'T NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT.

06:12.305 --> 06:17.044
>> YOU BETTER -- I'M GOING TO
MAKE SURE SHE'S -- IT'S LIKE WHY

06:17.077 --> 06:21.348
ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE TO EVICT
ME?

06:21.381 --> 06:27.488
I'M LIKE CODY --
>> JULIE SAID MEATBALL.

06:27.521 --> 06:39.199
>> LISTEN, CLEAN IT AND WORK
YOUR MADNESS.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.702
>> YOU GOT THE WHOLE THING.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.904
>> OH, HEY, MARK.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.372
INSERT FOOT INTO MOUTH.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.175
>> WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

06:48.208 --> 06:49.443
>> YOUR FACE WAS DEAD.

06:49.477 --> 06:52.112
>> WHY WAS I CHEERING FOR HIM?

06:52.145 --> 06:53.346
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

06:53.380 --> 06:56.750
WHY WOULD YOU SAY ELENA?

06:56.784 --> 06:59.653
WE WERE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE.

06:59.687 --> 07:00.521
>> WERE YOU?

07:00.554 --> 07:02.189
>> YES.

07:02.222 --> 07:04.257
>> BASICALLY HE CAUGHT ME OFF
GUARD.

07:04.291 --> 07:07.795
NOW I HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOME
KIND OF EXPLANATION TO EXPLAIN

07:07.828 --> 07:10.931
WHY I'M SO ANGRY AT HIM.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.199
>> WHICH SIDE ARE YOU ON?

07:12.232 --> 07:13.166
>> YOUR SIDE.

07:13.200 --> 07:13.734
>> PROVE IT.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.035
>> PROVE IT HOW?

07:15.068 --> 07:16.136
>> PROVE IT.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.906
>> THIS IS -- YOU THINK I WANT
CODY AND JESS TO WIN.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.341
>> YES, I DO.

07:21.374 --> 07:22.142
>> RIGHT.

07:22.175 --> 07:24.244
WHY

07:24.277 --> 07:27.548
>> THIS IS THE PROBLEM I HAVE --
>> I DON'T TALK TO THEM ABOUT

07:27.581 --> 07:28.516
GAME.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.851
I HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH CODY
FROM DAY ONE.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.385
HE'S THREW MY NAME UNDER THE
BUS.

07:32.419 --> 07:33.386
>> MULTIPLE TIMES.

07:33.420 --> 07:38.792
>> WHEN HE CAME BACK, I WAS
PISSED.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.994
>> IF YOU'RE GOING TO FLIP-FLOP,
WE'RE NOT OKAY.

07:41.028 --> 07:42.029
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.865
>> WHY ARE YOU --
>> YOU'RE ALWAYS TALKING TO JESS

07:44.898 --> 07:45.398
AND CODY.

07:45.432 --> 07:47.134
>> ALEX IS RIGHT.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.435
I HAVE BEEN PLAYING BOTH SIDES.

07:48.468 --> 07:53.774
I'VE BEEN TELLING PEOPLE WHAT
THEY WANT TO HEAR, I'VE BEEN

07:53.807 --> 07:54.775
FLIP-FLOPPING.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.276
HOWEVER SHE'S PHRASING IS WHAT
I'VE BEEN DOING.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.878
I NEED NUMBERS IN THIS GAME.

07:57.911 --> 08:01.348
I ALSO NEED PEOPLE I KNOW FOR
100% HAVE MY BACK.

08:01.381 --> 08:04.217
WHATEVER YOU'D LIKE TO THINK, ME
AND THEM DON'T TALK GAME.

08:04.251 --> 08:05.185
>> FINE.

08:05.218 --> 08:07.788
IF YOU'RE GOING TO FLIP-FLOP,
WE'RE NOT OKAY.

08:07.821 --> 08:08.689
>> WOW.

08:08.722 --> 08:11.291
I CAN'T BELIEVE I GOT AWAY WITH
THAT ONE.

08:11.324 --> 08:16.964
HOW DO I KNOW YOU'RE ON MY SIDE?

08:16.997 --> 08:20.701
>> GOOD JOB.

08:20.734 --> 08:21.602
CONGRATULATIONS.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.236
>> YOU KEEP THE PEOPLE THAT KEPT
YOU SAFE.

08:23.270 --> 08:26.173
>> FEELS GOOD TO BE HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD THIS WEEK.

08:26.206 --> 08:31.078
I HAVE A HUGE TARGET LIKE
MEATBALLS ON A PLATTER READY TO

08:31.111 --> 08:33.413
GET PUT ON THE BLOCK.

08:33.446 --> 08:36.850
>> IF YOU KNOW WE HAVE A
VENDETTA, THEN WHY DO YOU SAY

08:36.884 --> 08:38.919
OH, I'M NOT GOING TO WORRY ABOUT
THIS WEEK.

08:38.952 --> 08:41.889
YOU VOTED TO EVICT ME.

08:41.922 --> 08:45.392
I WANT ALL OF YOU AT THE SAME
TIME.

08:45.425 --> 08:50.497
>> THE ONLY DILEMMA IS FIGURING
OUT WHICH TWO TO PUT ON THE

08:50.530 --> 08:51.464
BLOCK.

08:51.498 --> 08:54.134
>> IF I TELL YOU CERTAIN THINGS,
LISTEN TO ME.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.969
WE'RE NOT GOING TO SUGGEST
ANYTHING CRAZY TO YOU.

08:56.003 --> 08:58.071
>> OF COURSE, I WANT JESS AND
CODY OUT.

08:58.105 --> 09:01.675
MARK AND ELENA ARE TARGETS
BECAUSE THEY'RE FLOATERS, THIS

09:01.709 --> 09:06.346
IS JOSH'S HOH AND NOT PAUL'S
HOH.

09:06.379 --> 09:10.183
LET'S HAVE A DISCUSSION INSTEAD
OF PAUL TELLING JOSH WHAT TO DO.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.653
>> WE SHOULD DO IT.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.421
>> ALL OF US?

09:14.454 --> 09:17.524
>> THEY'LL THINK WE'RE ALL
AGAINST THEM.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.493
>> IN THE COMPETITION, THE
WINNER IS AUTOMATICALLY SAFE AND

09:20.527 --> 09:22.730
THE LOSER IS AUTOMATICALLY ON
THE BLOCK.

09:22.763 --> 09:27.234
SO IF WE MAXIMIZE THE PEOPLE
PLAYING, IT'S HARDER FOR JESSICA

09:27.267 --> 09:28.736
OR CODY TO WIN.

09:28.769 --> 09:32.105
AS LONG AS ONE OF THEM DON'T
WIN, BOTH WILL BE ON THE BLOCK.

09:32.139 --> 09:39.512
THIS TIME ONE OF THEM WILL FOR
SURE GO HOME.

09:39.546 --> 09:45.052
>> I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.286
>> I JUST WANT TO WIN.

09:46.319 --> 09:47.688
I'M EXCITED FOR YOU.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.589
I GOT A LETTER FROM YOUR MOM.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.158
IT'S A GREAT ONE FOR YOU.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.125
>> YEAH.

09:52.159 --> 09:55.195
I HAD THREE VOTES TO BE EVICTED.

09:55.228 --> 10:00.100
I DIDN'T THINK THAT IT WOULD
COME DOWN TO YOU AND MARK.

10:00.133 --> 10:03.403
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

10:03.436 --> 10:07.174
>> THE WHOLE HOUSE WAS TELLING
ME TO VOTE YOU OUT.

10:07.207 --> 10:10.210
AND THEN WHAT WAS ACTUALLY
HAPPENING, THEY WERE GOING

10:10.243 --> 10:15.983
BEHIND MY BACK AND HAVING
CONVERSATIONS I WAS NOT PRIVY

10:16.016 --> 10:20.353
TOO AND DECIDING TO VOTE OUT
RAMSEY.

10:20.387 --> 10:24.324
>> I HAD A QUESTION, WHO IS
GOING HOME.

10:24.357 --> 10:27.995
>> FOR ME, EITHER RAMSEY WAS
GOING HOME OR -- THAT'S THE NAME

10:28.028 --> 10:29.162
OF THE GAME.

10:29.196 --> 10:34.234
>> IF I WAS VOTED OUT THAT DAY,
I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD THIS

10:34.267 --> 10:34.702
OPPORTUNITY.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.403
I WOULDN'T BE HOH.

10:36.436 --> 10:43.476
>> RAMSES CAME UP TO ME.

10:43.510 --> 10:45.312
VOTING ANYBODY OUT IS GOING TO
BE HARD.

10:45.345 --> 10:48.982
>> IF IT WAS THAT EASY FOR YOU,
MAYBE IT WILL BE EASY FOR ME TO

10:49.016 --> 10:50.784
PUT YOU ON THE BLOCK.

10:50.818 --> 10:53.520
>> TWO PEOPLE GO OUT, ONE PERSON
GOES HOME.

10:53.553 --> 10:54.187
IT SUCKS.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.757
>> I'LL HAVE TO SLEEP IT OFF.

11:06.066 --> 11:09.970
>> FELT SO GOOD.

11:10.003 --> 11:15.042
ITS HARD FOR ME BECAUSE EVERY
CONVERSATION I HAVE WITH ELENA,

11:15.075 --> 11:16.944
SHE TRIES TO GET INFORMATION.

11:16.977 --> 11:19.112
BELIEVE ME, I SEE ALL OF THAT.

11:19.146 --> 11:26.553
QUITE FRANKLY, I WOULD LOVE TO
GET ELENA BEFORE CODY AND JESS.

11:26.586 --> 11:29.322
>> I DISAGREE WITH THAT.

11:29.356 --> 11:34.361
>> THIS IS THE THING, ELENA
WANTS TO GET BACK IN WITH THE

11:34.394 --> 11:35.495
HOUSE AND ALL THAT.

11:35.528 --> 11:38.766
>> I'VE BEEN WORKING ON MY GAME
RELATIONSHIP WITH ELENA.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.567
I DON'T WANT JOSH TO MESS THAT
UP.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.603
I HAVE TO PUT HIS SIGHTS ON
JESSICA AND CODY.

11:43.636 --> 11:47.174
>> HERE'S THE POSITIVE THING
ABOUT THIS.

11:47.207 --> 11:51.044
FOUR TARGETS.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.645
SOMEBODY IS GOING HOME.

11:52.679 --> 11:57.450
JOSH, I WOULD RECOMMEND BE NICE
TO JESS AND CODY JUST IN CASE

11:57.484 --> 11:59.753
THEY GET THE SAFETY.

11:59.787 --> 12:01.922
IT KEEPS WATERS CALM.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.024
>> I CAN PLAY NICE WITH JESS.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.659
>> I WANT ALL TO PLAY NICE WITH
JESS.

12:06.693 --> 12:09.129
WHEN SHE GETS --
>> SHE'S ALREADY PLAYING NICE.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.831
>> THAT'S WHY SHE NEEDS TO
FIRST.

12:10.864 --> 12:11.298
>> YEAH.

12:11.331 --> 12:12.532
>> OKAY.

12:12.565 --> 12:15.135
JESSICA IS WHAT YOU WANT.

12:15.168 --> 12:15.969
JESSICA, JESSICA.

12:16.003 --> 12:16.669
WAY TO GO.

12:16.703 --> 12:20.107
BACK ON JESSICA.

12:20.140 --> 12:20.540
FANTASTIC.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.943
HIGH FIVE, JOSH.

12:22.976 --> 12:23.743
GREAT HOH.

12:23.777 --> 12:26.546
>> I NEED TO WORK OUT.

12:26.579 --> 12:29.349
FEEL LIKE I GAINED TEN POUNDS IN
ONE WEEK.

12:29.382 --> 12:34.754
>> I'M NOT SUPER MOTIVATED.

12:34.788 --> 12:46.766
>> I LOVE PAUL BUT DON'T DO
EVERYTHING HE SAYS.

12:46.800 --> 12:47.067
OKAY?

12:47.100 --> 12:57.144
>> YEAH.

12:57.144 --> 13:02.715
>> YEAH.

13:02.749 --> 13:09.222
>> I THINK YOU'RE BEING
PARANOID.

13:09.256 --> 13:13.326
>> I'M SURE I AM.
>> AFTER TALKING WITH JOSH, I'M

13:13.360 --> 13:14.727
NOT FEELING VERY GOOD.

13:14.761 --> 13:19.332
I WANT TO TALK TO HIM AND SEE
WHAT HE'S THINKING.

13:19.366 --> 13:21.334
>> THANK YOU.

13:21.368 --> 13:24.237
>> ANYONE HAVE ANYMORE
GAME-RELATED CONVERSATIONS

13:24.271 --> 13:27.374
THEY'D LIKE TO HAVE WITH ME
BEFORE I TAKE MY EYELASHES OFF?

13:27.407 --> 13:28.641
>> YOU ARE GOOD.

13:28.675 --> 13:32.612
AND MOVING FORWARD, I HOPE THAT
YOU SEE IF I DO YOU A SOLID YOU

13:32.645 --> 13:33.881
DO THE SAME FOR ME.

13:33.914 --> 13:39.086
>> LISTEN, ELENA, I'LL STREET
TALK YOU TO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO

13:39.119 --> 13:39.920
HEAR.

13:39.953 --> 13:48.996
KNOW THAT YOU'RE MY TARGET THIS
WEEK.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.663
>> WHATEVER YOU WANT, BOUNCE IT
OFF ME.

13:50.697 --> 13:55.068
>> I WANT ELENA OUT.

13:55.102 --> 14:02.943
JESS AND CODY ARE OBVIOUS
TARGETS.

14:02.976 --> 14:10.083
HE SHE'S A GREAT LIAR AND
EXTREMELY PERSUASIVE.

14:10.117 --> 14:12.252
SHE COULD ENTERTAIN.

14:12.285 --> 14:15.588
SHE DID IT TO ME IN THE STORAGE
ROOM.

14:15.622 --> 14:18.926
SHE'S LOCKED IN JESS, CODY AND
MARK.

14:18.959 --> 14:26.433
>> ELENA IS LOCKED IN WITH PAUL.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.435
THIS IS WHY I WANT PAUL OUT OF
THIS.

14:28.468 --> 14:33.273
SHE DOESN'T SEE WHAT I SEE IN
ELENA.

14:33.306 --> 14:37.877
>> YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO START
SAYING, DUDE, I'M THE HOH.

14:37.911 --> 14:40.948
I WANT TO DO THINGS FOR YOU BUT
LET ME ENJOY THIS.

14:40.981 --> 14:44.817
>> OBVIOUSLY PAUL HAS HAD HIS
HAND IN EVERY HOH EXCEPT FOR

14:44.851 --> 14:46.153
JESS AND CODY'S.

14:46.186 --> 14:51.491
THIS IS JOSH'S HOH, SO I JUST
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT JOSH IS

14:51.524 --> 14:54.527
LOOKED OUT FOR AND THAT BIG OLD
MEATBALL DOESN'T GET RAILROADED.

15:03.436 --> 15:06.039
>> EVEN THOUGH ME AND PAUL ARE
BOYS AND WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER,

15:06.073 --> 15:11.511
THIS IS MY HOH AND I'M A TARGET
AND I'M GOING TO GET OUT WHO I

15:11.544 --> 15:12.279
WANT.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.814
TWO WEEKS AGO, ELENA VOTED ME
OUT.

15:14.847 --> 15:16.849
SHE COULD CARE LESS IF I LEFT.

15:16.883 --> 15:17.951
GUESS WHAT, ELENA?

15:17.985 --> 15:21.154
I'M HOH NOW AND I HAVE COMPLETE
CONTROL.

15:21.188 --> 15:23.323
YOU'RE LOOKING LIKE A REAL NICE
TARGET.

15:23.356 --> 15:28.395
>> I KNOW YOU WANT TO TALK TO
PEOPLE TO BOUNCE THINGS OFF BUT

15:28.428 --> 15:31.798
NO, THAT'S HOW YOU GET --

15:44.844 --> 15:53.186
>> AFTER THE SUNRISES, YOU WILL
BE SUMMONED BACK TO THE DEN OF

15:53.220 --> 16:00.760
TEMPTATION WHERE YOU ONCE AGAIN
MUST CHOOSE WHETHER OR NOT TO

16:00.793 --> 16:06.366
COMPETE IN THE TEMPTATION
COMPETITION.

16:06.399 --> 16:13.173
THINK LONG AND HARD ABOUT WHAT
YOU WANT TO DO BECAUSE YOUR "BIG

16:13.206 --> 16:21.948
BROTHER" LIFE COULD BE ON THE
LINE.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.651
>> THE TEMPTATION COMP IS A
CRAZY RISK.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.254
IF YOU WIN, YOU GET SAFETY.

16:27.287 --> 16:34.027
IF YOU LOSE, YOU GO ON THE
BLOCK.

16:34.061 --> 16:35.495
>> IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.764
REGARDLESS OF ANYTHING THAT
HAPPENS, IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT.

16:37.797 --> 16:39.232
>> I'M JUST FRUSTRATED.

16:39.266 --> 16:41.934
WE FOUGHT SO HARD.

16:41.968 --> 16:45.638
>> WE SHOULD JUST PLAY SAFELY.

16:45.672 --> 16:46.906
WHAT IS THERE TO LOSE?

16:46.939 --> 16:48.175
>> I AGREE.

16:48.208 --> 16:51.544
>> BEST CASE ONE OF US WINS THE
TEMPTATION COMP AND IS SAFE FOR

16:51.578 --> 16:52.812
THE WEEK.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.582
IF ONE OF US LOSES AND BECOMES
THE THIRD NOMINEE, WE CAN PLAY

16:55.615 --> 16:56.616
IN THE VETO.

16:56.649 --> 16:59.852
>> ONE OF US HAS TO WIN THE
VETO.

16:59.886 --> 17:04.057
>> IF ONE OF US CAN WIN SAFETY
AND ONE WIN VETO, WE CAN SURVIVE

17:04.091 --> 17:06.459
ANOTHER WEEK.

17:06.493 --> 17:16.703
>> LET'S DO IT.

17:16.736 --> 17:26.779
>> JASON, YOU MAY NOT ENTER THE
DEN.

17:26.779 --> 17:32.419
>> JASON, YOU MAY NOT ENTER THE
DEN.

17:32.452 --> 17:38.558
JASON, IF YOU WISH THE
PARTICIPATE IN THE TEMPTATION

17:38.591 --> 17:42.095
COMPETITION, DRINK THE GREEN
POTION.

17:42.129 --> 17:50.103
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO RISK IT,
DRINK THE RED ONE.

17:50.137 --> 17:54.307
>> OUR SIDE OF THE HOUSE WANTS
TO COMPETE IN THE TEMPTATION

17:54.341 --> 17:57.877
COMPETITION SO THAT WAY WE CAN
KEEP YES, SIR AND CODY FROM

17:57.910 --> 18:03.250
HAVING SAFETY THIS WEEK SO WE
CAN GET ONE OF THEM ON THE

18:03.283 --> 18:08.421
BLOCK.

18:08.455 --> 18:10.657
>> WHAT IS THAT?

18:10.690 --> 18:18.531
MAYONNAISE?

18:18.565 --> 18:31.244
CHEERS!
>> JOSH IS HOH.

18:31.278 --> 18:32.945
THE ENTIRE HOUSE IS AGAINST US.

18:32.979 --> 18:35.382
OUR BACKS ARE AGAINST THE WALL.

18:35.415 --> 18:38.551
I HAVE TO GET SAFETY IN THIS
NEXT TEMPTATION COMPETITION AND

18:38.585 --> 18:43.556
THEN SHE CAN PLAY FOR THE VETO.

18:43.590 --> 18:48.428
>> FOR THE 600th TIME, IT'S CODY
AND I AGAINST THE ENTIRE HOUSE.

18:48.461 --> 18:52.565
SO OUR ONLY CHANCE OF SURVIVAL
IS IF ONE OF US CAN WIN THE

18:52.599 --> 18:53.500
COMP.

18:53.533 --> 18:56.503
>> NOBODY WILL KEEP US SAFE.

18:56.536 --> 19:01.608
SO WE HAVE TO EARN IT.

19:01.641 --> 19:13.786
YEP, THAT'S GROSS.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.256
>> NO SECRET, THE "BIG BROTHER"
HOUSE IS HAUNTED.

19:16.289 --> 19:20.793
BEFORE YOU MOVE IN, A TEAM OF
PARANORMAL EXPERTS WILL MOVE IN

19:20.827 --> 19:23.062
AND QUENCH THE HOUSE OF THEIR
SPIRITS.

19:23.095 --> 19:28.034
THEY MEDDLE WITH THE WORLD THEY
DON'T UNDERSTAND AND OPEN UP THE

19:28.067 --> 19:33.573
PORTAL TO THE INSIDE OUT.

19:33.606 --> 19:37.009
YOU WILL BE LED TO AN ITEM THAT
WILL CLOSE THE PORTAL.

19:37.043 --> 19:40.613
THESE CLUES CONTAIN LETTERS.

19:40.647 --> 19:46.018
WHEN UNSCRAMBLED, THEY WILL
REVEAL THE ITEM YOU'RE LOOKING

19:46.052 --> 19:47.119
FOR.

19:47.153 --> 19:50.623
ONCE FOUND, PLACE IT IN THE
SACRED CHEST AND CLOSE IT.

19:50.657 --> 19:54.160
THE PLAYER THAT ACCOMPLISHES
THIS IN THE SHORTEST AMOUNT OF

19:54.193 --> 19:56.429
TIME WILL BE SAFE FOR THE WEEK.

19:56.463 --> 20:00.700
THE PLAYER WHO TAKES THE LONGEST
WILL BE THE SPECIAL THIRD

20:00.733 --> 20:02.235
NOMINEE.

20:02.269 --> 20:09.876
ARE YOU READY TO PLAY STRANGER
THINGS?

20:09.909 --> 20:11.110
.

20:11.143 --> 20:14.113
>> LAST WEEK I SUCKED IT UP IN
THE BULL ARENA AND BECAME THE

20:14.146 --> 20:15.315
THIRD NOMINEE.

20:15.348 --> 20:21.754
THIS WEEK I HAVE TO REDEEM
MYSELF AND KEEP THAT SAFETY OUT

20:21.788 --> 20:25.492
OF JESS AND CODY'S HANDS.

20:25.525 --> 20:35.568
THERE'S NOTHING HERE THAT WILL
SCARE ME.

20:35.568 --> 20:47.213
THERE'S NOTHING HERE THAT WILL
SCARE ME.

20:47.246 --> 20:52.385
I AM LOOKING FOR CLUES.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.521
I SEE AN A CIRCLE.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.556
THAT MEANS A IS A CLUE.

20:56.589 --> 20:59.726
I SEE AND H CIRCLE.

20:59.759 --> 21:06.566
THAT MEANS H IS A CLUE.

21:06.599 --> 21:12.204
NOW I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
THESE LETTERS SPELL.

21:12.238 --> 21:19.479
>> COME ON, BUDDY.

21:19.512 --> 21:24.083
I HAVE AN -- I GRAB A CROW.

21:24.116 --> 21:34.160
I HAVE NO IDEA HART.

21:34.160 --> 21:40.400
I HAVE NO IDEA HART.

21:40.433 --> 21:42.835
IT DOESN'T GET MORE PLAIN THAN
THAT.

21:42.869 --> 21:45.938
SO I NEED TO FIND A HART.

21:45.972 --> 21:59.051
NOT A CROW.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.953
>> IT'S PITCH BLACK.

22:00.987 --> 22:06.793
IT'S WAY DARKER AND WAY SCARIER
THAN I EVER PREPARED MYSELF FOR.

22:06.826 --> 22:13.566
BUT I'VE BEEN IN THE DARK AND
SCARED THE LAST SEVEN DAYS.

22:13.600 --> 22:16.168
JOSH HAS PROMISED ME I'M GOOD
THIS WEEK.

22:16.202 --> 22:21.874
IF JESS OR CODY WIN, THERE'S A
CHANCE I COULD BE GOING ON THE

22:21.908 --> 22:28.515
BLOCK.

22:28.548 --> 22:30.583
>> I DON'T LIKE THAT.

22:30.617 --> 22:32.351
DON'T TOUCH ME.

22:32.385 --> 22:33.886
I DON'T LIKE YOU.

22:33.920 --> 22:40.092
PLEASE GET AWAY FROM ME.

22:40.126 --> 22:40.527
OKAY.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.529
IT'S VERY DARK.

22:42.562 --> 22:46.232
I DON'T LIKE YOU.

22:46.265 --> 22:47.634
DON'T TOUCH ME.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.969
OKAY.

22:50.002 --> 22:50.770
PERFECT.

22:50.803 --> 22:57.376
OF COURSE I NEED TO WATCH MY
BACK.

22:57.410 --> 23:00.813
NO.

23:00.847 --> 23:07.186
NO.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.622
H, A, T, R.

23:09.656 --> 23:10.289
NO.

23:10.322 --> 23:13.125
GET THE  AWAY FROM ME.

23:13.159 --> 23:14.561
NO THANK YOU.

23:14.594 --> 23:17.697
GET AWAY FROM ME.

23:17.730 --> 23:21.233
MOVE.

23:21.267 --> 23:21.968
HEART.

23:22.001 --> 23:22.835
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.

23:22.869 --> 23:25.271
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO FIND A
HEART?

23:25.304 --> 23:28.140
IS THERE A HEART IN HERE?

23:28.174 --> 23:32.111
I DIDN'T LOOK IN THIS ROOM.

23:32.144 --> 23:32.579
HEART.

23:32.612 --> 23:36.048
I DON'T WANT THAT.

23:36.082 --> 23:40.587
I FINALLY FOUND THE HEART AND
LOCK IN MY TIME.

23:40.620 --> 23:43.656
HOPEFULLY SOMEONE ELSE OTHER
THAN JESS AND CODY SECURED

23:43.690 --> 23:47.760
SAFETY THIS WEEK SO I'M NOT THE
TARGET.

23:47.794 --> 23:49.095
>> I'M SCARED RIGHT NOW.

23:49.128 --> 23:54.433
BUT I DON'T FEEL SAFE AS LONG AS
JOSH IS HOH.

23:54.467 --> 23:57.069
>> DAMN, DAMN.

23:57.103 --> 24:02.074
I HAVE TO WIN THIS THING AND GET
SAFETY SO THE MEATBALL MONSTER

24:02.108 --> 24:11.951
DOESN'T EAT ME.

24:11.984 --> 24:14.521
HELP ME.

24:14.554 --> 24:14.754
OKAY.

24:14.787 --> 24:18.357
T-R.

24:18.390 --> 24:21.127
OH, BABY.

24:21.160 --> 24:29.636
OH, OH.

24:29.669 --> 24:34.607
>> I'M A PROFESSIONAL GHOST
HUNTER.

24:34.641 --> 24:47.053
AIN'T NOTHING IN THIS HOUSE THAT
I HAVE NOT SEEN BEFORE.

24:47.086 --> 24:49.388
OH, NOT COOL, GUYS.

24:49.421 --> 24:53.893
NOT COOL.

24:53.926 --> 25:02.434
OH, THAT IS NOT FUNNY!
>> HOST TO THE PORTAL.

25:02.468 --> 25:04.003
OH, MY GOD.

25:04.036 --> 25:07.540
YOU'VE BEEN HIDING THERE THE
WHOLE TIME?

25:07.574 --> 25:22.021
ARE YOU KIDDING?

25:22.054 --> 25:23.656
>> THIS IS AWESOME.

25:23.690 --> 25:26.859
I LOVE HALLOWEEN, I LOVE SCARY
STUFF.

25:26.893 --> 25:29.662
HAVING A GOOD TIME RIGHT NOW
THAT I'M ALMOST FORGETTING I

25:29.696 --> 25:34.667
HAVE TO BEAT JESS AND CODY.

25:34.701 --> 25:37.837
>> I'M GOING TO POOP.

25:37.870 --> 25:49.448
GOING TO POOP MY PANTS.

25:49.481 --> 25:49.749
TERRIFYING.

25:49.782 --> 25:50.282
OH, GOT.

25:50.316 --> 25:51.884
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY.

25:51.918 --> 25:53.019
THIS COMPETITION SUCKS.

25:53.052 --> 25:55.588
I DON'T LIKE IT.

25:55.622 --> 26:00.226
I CAN'T EVEN GET IN THE FIRST
ROOM.

26:00.259 --> 26:05.598
I WANT MY MOMMY.

26:05.632 --> 26:06.098
NO.

26:06.132 --> 26:08.534
WHY IS THAT MOVING?

26:08.567 --> 26:12.639
>> MY PLAN IS NOT TO THROW THIS
COMPETITION BUT I DON'T HAVE TO

26:12.672 --> 26:14.741
THROW THE COMPETITION, THIS IS
TERRIFYING.

26:14.774 --> 26:17.910
I DON'T WANT TO GO ANYWHERE.

26:17.944 --> 26:20.647
I HOPE CODY WINS SO HE CAN SAVE
ME.

26:20.680 --> 26:23.616
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY THIS.

26:23.650 --> 26:33.793
CAN I JUST FORFEIT?

26:33.826 --> 26:36.829
>> I'M NOT SCARED OF NO HAUNTED
HOUSES.

26:36.863 --> 26:39.699
YOU SHOULD SEE THE NEIGHBORHOOD
I GREW UP IN.

26:39.732 --> 26:49.776
IF YOU THINK THAT IS SCARY, TRY
BEING IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD.

26:49.776 --> 27:04.623
IF YOU THINK THAT IS SCARY, TRY
BEING IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD.

27:04.657 --> 27:10.529
THAT MAY BE IT, MAN.

27:10.562 --> 27:12.564
MAY BE IT.

27:23.175 --> 27:23.843
OH, MAN.

27:23.876 --> 27:28.314
YOU DID A GREAT JOB, BY THE WAY.

27:28.347 --> 27:33.853
>> I'M NOT AFRAID OF THE DARK.

27:33.886 --> 27:38.457
I KNOW I GOT TO WIN THIS
COMPETITION AND NOTHING WILL

27:38.490 --> 27:40.492
RATTLE ME.

28:23.102 --> 28:32.544
>> LET'S GET THIS GOING, BIG
BROTHER.

28:32.578 --> 28:34.313
OH, CRAP.

28:34.346 --> 28:37.083
NO, NO, NO.

28:37.116 --> 28:39.251
HELP ME, HELP ME.

28:39.285 --> 28:40.519
OH, GOD.

28:40.552 --> 28:43.422
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME I'VE
HAD TO DEAL WITH DEMONS IN THE

28:43.455 --> 28:44.423
"BIG BROTHER" HOUSE.

28:44.456 --> 28:49.128
>> OH, MY GOD!
>> JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

28:49.161 --> 28:55.902
JESSICA AND CODY DIDN'T WIN
SAFETY SO I CAN GET THOSE DEMONS

28:55.935 --> 28:58.704
ON THE BLOCK.

28:58.737 --> 29:01.841
OH, MY GOD!
HELP ME.

29:01.874 --> 29:06.612
HELP ME.

29:06.645 --> 29:10.783
OH!
>> I'M READY.

29:10.817 --> 29:11.951
I'M EXCITED.

29:11.984 --> 29:14.821
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS WAITING
FOR ME AROUND THE CORNER.

29:14.854 --> 29:24.897
IT'S TIME TO EXORCISE THE
DEMONS, JESS AND CODY.

29:24.897 --> 29:29.936
IT'S TIME TO EXORCISE THE
DEMONS, JESS AND CODY.

29:29.969 --> 29:31.370
REALLY TIGHT.

29:31.403 --> 29:32.138
OKAY, COOL.

29:32.171 --> 29:33.772
I'LL HELP MYSELF FIRST.

29:33.806 --> 29:35.074
THERE'S ALL SORTS OF WEIRD
STUFF.

29:35.107 --> 29:35.474
ALL RIGHT.

29:35.507 --> 29:36.308
LET'S DO THIS.

29:36.342 --> 29:39.045
THIS IS FUN.

29:39.078 --> 29:44.016
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

29:44.050 --> 29:45.384
THERES NOISE.

29:45.417 --> 29:47.553
LOOKS LIKE MY ROOM.

29:47.586 --> 29:50.189
OF COURSE, THE HAVE NOT ROOM.

29:50.222 --> 29:52.892
THERE'S PEOPLE IN HERE.

29:52.925 --> 29:58.397
THERE'S NOTHING HERE.

29:58.430 --> 30:00.132
YEAH, THERE'S PEOPLE HERE.

30:00.166 --> 30:01.000
YOU'RE HERE TOO?

30:01.033 --> 30:01.767
WHERE'S THE HEART?

30:01.800 --> 30:05.737
THERE'S A BABY.

30:05.771 --> 30:07.473
THAT'S A HAND.

30:07.506 --> 30:11.043
LOOKS LIKE I REALLY NEED A HAND.

30:11.077 --> 30:18.985
I'M BACK IN HERE WITH YOU.

30:19.018 --> 30:22.288
OW, OW, EVERYBODY OUT OF MY WAY.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.023
OUT OF MY WAY.

30:24.056 --> 30:26.625
I KNOW YOU'RE HERE.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.928
GET OUT OF MY WAY, TOO.

30:28.961 --> 30:30.229
LOOK, THAT WAS SCARY.

30:30.262 --> 30:33.966
WITH JESSICA AND CODY WINNING
AND BEING SAFE ANOTHER WEEK IS

30:34.000 --> 30:35.567
EVEN SCARIER.

30:35.601 --> 30:38.604
LET'S WIN THIS DAMN THING AND
SEND ONE OF THEM HOME FOR GOOD.

30:46.345 --> 30:47.579
>> ALL RIGHT.

30:47.613 --> 30:50.682
IT'S TIME TO SEE HOW YOU DID ON
THE STRANGER THINGS COMPETITION.

30:50.716 --> 30:52.718
>> THE TEMPTATION COMPETITION IS
GRAVY.

30:52.751 --> 30:55.254
IF YOU PLAY AND YOU WIN, YOU GET
SAFETY FOR THE WEEK.

30:55.287 --> 31:00.426
IF YOU PLAY AND YOU LOSE, YOU'RE
THE THIRD NOMINEE ON THE BLOCK.

31:00.459 --> 31:03.595
HIGH RISK, HIGH REWARD.

31:03.629 --> 31:09.201
>> MARK, YOUR TIME WAS 7:06.

31:09.235 --> 31:12.738
THAT MEANS THAT YOU'RE CURRENTLY
IN FIRST PLACE.

31:12.771 --> 31:15.341
KEVIN --
>> HI, JOSH.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.509
>> THREE MINUTES AND 11 SECONDS.

31:17.543 --> 31:20.046
>> I THOUGHT I WAS FASTER THAN
THAT.

31:20.079 --> 31:22.814
KEVIN YOU'RE IN THE LEAD.

31:22.848 --> 31:24.616
ELENA?

31:24.650 --> 31:29.821
YOU FINISHED WITH A TIME OF 12
MINUTES AND 31 SECONDS.

31:29.855 --> 31:32.491
THAT MAKES YOU LAST PLACE.

31:32.524 --> 31:36.662
>> THANK YOU.

31:36.695 --> 31:39.765
JASON, 12 MINUTES AND SEVEN
SECONDS.

31:39.798 --> 31:44.470
>> JEEZ, I MUST HAVE TAKEN A
NAP.

31:44.503 --> 31:48.840
JESSICA, YOUR TIME WAS 15
MINUTES.

31:48.874 --> 31:54.413
THAT MEANS THAT YOU'RE CURRENTLY
IN LAST PLACE.

31:54.446 --> 32:00.186
RAVEN, YOUR TIME WAS NINE
MINUTES.

32:00.219 --> 32:12.698
CODY, YOUR TIME WAS THREE
MINUTES.

32:12.731 --> 32:16.302
CODY, YOU'RE CURRENTLY IN FIRST
PLACE.

32:16.335 --> 32:20.372
MATT, LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN BEAT
CODY'S TIME OF THREE MINUTES.

32:20.406 --> 32:24.110
>> THIS IS A ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE
SCENARIO.

32:24.143 --> 32:29.248
ALL OF US WHO PARTICIPATED
WANTED TO PREVENT CODY AND JESS

32:29.281 --> 32:30.582
FROM GETTING SAFETY.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.818
NOW OF COURSE CODY IS IN THE
LEAD.

32:32.851 --> 32:35.421
YOU GOT THREE MINUTES AND 42
SECONDS.

32:35.454 --> 32:40.226
>> I'M JUST HOPING THAT SOMEBODY
CAN BEAT HIS TIME.

32:40.259 --> 32:40.759
ALEX.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.494
>> I KNOW I DID WELL.

32:42.528 --> 32:51.070
I JUST AM HOPING THAT IT WAS
GOOD ENOUGH TO BEAT CODY.

32:51.103 --> 32:53.072
>> THREE MINUTES AND SIX
SECONDS.

32:53.105 --> 32:55.074
IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THIS.

32:55.107 --> 33:00.779
PAUL, YOU NEED TO BEAT JESSICA'S
TIME OF 15 MINUTES AND NOT GET

33:00.812 --> 33:06.752
LAST PLACE AND BEAT CODY'S TIME
TO GET FIRST PLACE.

33:06.785 --> 33:14.526
YOUR TIME WAS 3 MINUTES AND 34
SECOND.

33:14.560 --> 33:19.331
CODY, THAT MEANS YOU'RE SAFE FOR
THE WEEK.

33:19.365 --> 33:20.666
JESS, YOU'RE THE THIRD NOMINEE.

33:20.699 --> 33:23.302
>> WE EXECUTED THE PLAN
PERFECTLY.

33:23.335 --> 33:27.339
NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS WIN
VETO AND JESSICA AND I CAN STICK

33:27.373 --> 33:28.474
AROUND TO FIGHT ANOTHER WEEK.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.876
>> CODY IS SAFE.

33:30.909 --> 33:31.143
HOW?

33:31.177 --> 33:31.977
HOW?

33:32.010 --> 33:33.579
HOW DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING?

33:33.612 --> 33:36.548
BUT AT LEAST JESSICA IS ON THE
BLOCK.

33:36.582 --> 33:38.884
SO IT'S NOT A COMPLETE FAILURE.

33:38.917 --> 33:39.985
>> I'M HAPPY.

33:40.018 --> 33:46.292
WE HAVE ONE MORE COMPETITION AND
THEN WE ARE HOME FREE.

33:46.325 --> 33:53.432
>> CONGRATULATIONS, CODY.

33:53.465 --> 33:55.934
GOOD JOB, GUYS.

33:55.967 --> 34:01.740
GOOD JOB, GOOD JOB.

34:01.773 --> 34:05.744
>> SHE THREW THAT.

34:05.777 --> 34:09.181
>> THAT WAS PERFECT STRATEGY.

34:09.215 --> 34:13.752
>> CODY IS SAFE AND JESSICA IS
THE THIRD NOMINEE.

34:13.785 --> 34:14.753
THIS IS NOT IDEAL.

34:14.786 --> 34:22.928
I STILL COULD BE GOING ON THE
BLOCK.

34:22.961 --> 34:26.398
>> I'M GOING UP.

34:26.432 --> 34:29.768
>> THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE.

34:29.801 --> 34:31.503
>> DAMN, DAMN, DAMN.

34:31.537 --> 34:38.110
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE A
SIMPLE WEEK.

34:38.144 --> 34:40.246
>> ME?

34:40.279 --> 34:50.322
>> YOU THINK SO?

34:50.322 --> 34:57.129
>> YOU THINK SO?

34:57.163 --> 34:59.097
>> WE HAVE TO GET THAT VETO.

34:59.131 --> 35:05.904
IF WE GIVE IT TO JESSICA, ELENA
COMES TO OUR SIDE.

35:05.937 --> 35:12.644
>> SHE'S EXTREMELY PERSUASIVE A
GREAT LIAR AND SHE'S SHADY.

35:12.678 --> 35:14.213
>> EVERYBODY SEES IT THOUGH.

35:14.246 --> 35:15.481
I'M NOT SAYING YOU'RE WRONG.

35:15.514 --> 35:17.916
I'M SAYING THERE'S AN ORDER OF
OPERATION.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.285
I GET WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM.

35:19.318 --> 35:20.952
I HAVE INFORMATION YOU DON'T
KNOW.

35:20.986 --> 35:25.023
SHE'S BEEN TRYING TO
DISASSOCIATE WITH MARK FOR TWO

35:25.056 --> 35:25.991
WEEKS.

35:26.024 --> 35:28.727
>> SHE DOES WANT TO.
>> SHE'S BEEN TRYING TO

35:28.760 --> 35:33.532
DISASSOCIATE WITH MARK --
>> I TELL YOU SOMETHING, I'M

35:33.565 --> 35:35.867
PUTTING HER UP.

35:35.901 --> 35:39.705
THESE ARE CONCERNS THAT I'VE HAD
AND I HAVE BEEN SEEING.

35:39.738 --> 35:41.873
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE SEEING
WHAT I'M SEEING.

35:41.907 --> 35:43.041
>> I SEE IT.

35:43.074 --> 35:44.976
YOU CAN'T BE STUPID ABOUT IT.

35:45.010 --> 35:48.514
SO RIGHT NOW, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS TELL THEM THEY'RE PAWNS AND

35:48.547 --> 35:51.817
WE HAVE TO PULL THIS OFF FOR THE
WIN BECAUSE JESSICA IS A TARGET.

35:51.850 --> 35:56.222
I'M GOING TO TALK TO THIS BE
LIKE YO, WE'RE BRINGING YOU TWO

35:56.255 --> 35:57.589
UP AS PAWN.

35:57.623 --> 35:59.258
HE DOESN'T WANT TO RISK IT.

35:59.291 --> 36:00.559
I'M GOING TO SAY THAT.

36:00.592 --> 36:01.493
YOU KNOW WHAT?

36:01.527 --> 36:02.528
IT'S LIKE A TEAM EFFORT.

36:02.561 --> 36:06.798
>> SURE, PAUL, WE'LL TELL ELENA
THAT SHE'S A PAWN.

36:06.832 --> 36:10.302
LITTLE DO YOU KNOW THAT SHE'S MY
TARGET AND THERE'S NOT MUCH YOU

36:10.336 --> 36:10.969
CAN DO ABOUT IT.

36:11.002 --> 36:13.372
>> JUST STAY HERE.

36:24.250 --> 36:31.657
>> PUT IT BACK.

36:31.690 --> 36:36.027
>> I TRIED TO OFFER MY HELP AS A
PAWN.

36:36.061 --> 36:40.432
I TRIED TO HELP.

36:40.466 --> 36:44.803
>> YOU OFFERED.
>> PAUL TELLS ME THAT JOSH IS

36:44.836 --> 36:46.472
WANTING TO USE ME AS A PAWN.

36:46.505 --> 36:48.940
I'D LIKE TO TALK TO JOSH AND SEE
WHAT HE'S THINKING AND WHAT HAS

36:48.974 --> 36:53.445
INSPIRED THIS CRAZY IDEA.

36:53.479 --> 36:54.613
>> HOLA.
>> HEY.

36:54.646 --> 36:57.649
>> YOU WANT TO PUT ME UP AS
PAWN?

36:57.683 --> 36:58.216
>> YEAH.

36:58.250 --> 36:59.718
>> YOU SAID I WAS GOOD.

36:59.751 --> 37:00.419
I'M NOT.

37:00.452 --> 37:03.922
>> YOU ARE A STRONG COMPETITOR.

37:03.955 --> 37:10.362
IN ORDER TO SECURE THAT SHE DOES
NOT WIN THE VETO, YOU WIN THE

37:10.396 --> 37:11.530
VETO.

37:11.563 --> 37:15.166
>> I KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO THE
PAWN BECAUSE I'M THE BEST

37:15.200 --> 37:15.934
COMPETITOR.

37:15.967 --> 37:17.769
PAUL HAS COMPETED BETTER THAN
ME.

37:17.803 --> 37:21.840
SO I WOULD BE CURIOUS TO KNOW
WHAT YOUR REAL REASON TO PUT ME

37:21.873 --> 37:25.043
UP AS A PAWN IS.
>> JOSH, THE REAL REASON YOU'RE

37:25.076 --> 37:29.648
PUTTING ME ON THE BLOCK IS
BECAUSE I'M NOT THE BEST

37:29.681 --> 37:31.850
COMPETITOR BUT I DON'T DOUBT MY
CAPABILITIES.

37:31.883 --> 37:38.123
>> I KNOW I'M NOT GOING UP
BECAUSE I'M THE BEST COMPETITOR.

37:38.156 --> 37:41.627
>> THE REASON I'M GOING ON THE
BLACK IS BECAUSE I PUT YOU UP.

37:41.660 --> 37:45.431
>> I HAVE NOT COMPETED BETTER
THAN OTHER OPTIONS.

37:45.464 --> 37:47.633
>> I'LL PUT PAUL UP HERE.

37:47.666 --> 37:52.304
I DON'T WANT YOU TO FEEL -- IS
THIS YOUR HOH OR PAUL'S HOH?

37:52.338 --> 37:54.072
>> I NED A PAWN.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.341
IT'S IN YOUR HANDS.

37:55.374 --> 37:59.244
>> ALL ELENA IS SHOWING ME WHILE
SHE'S SPAZZING OUT, THIS IS THE

37:59.277 --> 38:00.546
REASON WHY I CAN'T TRUST HER.

38:00.579 --> 38:05.417
>> I CALL HIM UP --
>> IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SEE

38:05.451 --> 38:08.987
WHY --
>> SHE'S EXTREMELY MANIPULATIVE

38:09.020 --> 38:12.090
AND SHE'S THROWING PAUL UNDER
THE RUG.

38:12.123 --> 38:13.559
ELENA, YOU MADE YOUR BED.

38:13.592 --> 38:17.062
YOU SEALED YOUR FATE AND YOU
HAVE TO GO.

38:17.095 --> 38:19.297
>> HI.

38:19.331 --> 38:21.667
WANT TO COME HERE REAL QUICK?

38:21.700 --> 38:23.902
>> WHAT'S UP?

38:23.935 --> 38:25.003
>> OKAY.

38:25.036 --> 38:26.638
SHE'S CONCERNED ABOUT GOING UP
ON THE BLOCK.

38:26.672 --> 38:27.305
>> OKAY.

38:27.339 --> 38:29.040
>> AS WOULD ANYONE.

38:29.074 --> 38:31.176
>> LIKE WE SPOKE ABOUT IT.

38:31.209 --> 38:34.245
I TOLD YOU I DON'T WANT YOU TO
GO ON THE BLOCK BECAUSE I DON'T

38:34.279 --> 38:35.714
WANT TO RISK IT.

38:35.747 --> 38:38.450
FOR ME, IT'S A BETTER MOVE TO
PUT YOU UP AS A PAWN.

38:38.484 --> 38:42.053
>> I'M NOT TELLING YOU I'M MORE
ENTITLED TO BE IN THIS GAME THAN

38:42.087 --> 38:43.288
ANYONE ELSE.

38:43.321 --> 38:48.960
>> DIDN'T YOU TELL ME HE'S A
STRONG COMPETITOR AND AND SO IS

38:48.994 --> 38:50.161
ALEX?

38:50.195 --> 38:53.264
>> YOU SAID YOUR STRATEGY IS TO
PUT TWO STRONG COMPETITORS

38:53.298 --> 38:54.232
AGAINST JESSICA.

38:54.265 --> 38:56.334
I OFFERED YOU IN THE FLAW IN
YOUR REASONING.

38:56.368 --> 38:59.805
>> YOU DIDN'T SUGGEST THAT ALEX
AND PAUL ARE STRONGER

38:59.838 --> 39:01.973
COMPETITORS AND THAT HE PLAYED
BEFORE AND HE --

39:02.007 --> 39:04.309
>> I OFFERED YOU THE FLAW AND
YOUR REASONING.

39:04.342 --> 39:08.146
>> ELENA, DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
THAT ALEX AND PAUL --

39:08.179 --> 39:11.717
>> JOSH, YOU LISTEN TO ME --
>> AND MY FATHER AND --

39:11.750 --> 39:13.251
>> WE'RE NOT.

39:13.284 --> 39:17.088
>> DID YOU NOT TELL ME THAT ALEX
AND PAUL

39:17.122 --> 39:19.190
>> OH, MY GOD.

39:19.224 --> 39:23.862
I SAID PAUL TOLD ME THAT HE
OFFERED TO GO ON THE BLOCK --

39:23.895 --> 39:27.298
>> LOOK, IF YOU NEEDED A STRONG
COMPETITOR TO WATCH FOR YOU, I'M

39:27.332 --> 39:28.434
DOWN TO FIGHT.

39:28.467 --> 39:32.270
>> IF YOU DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE
GOING UP, YOU MADE THE

39:32.303 --> 39:37.075
SUGGESTION THAT PAUL AND ABBY --
>> JOSH, YOU'RE MAKING IT SOUNDS

39:37.108 --> 39:38.977
LIKE --
>> I'M NOT.

39:39.010 --> 39:40.412
WE'RE AGAINST JESS AND CODY.

39:40.446 --> 39:45.551
>> IF YOU DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE
GOING UP AS A PAWN --

39:45.584 --> 39:47.419
>> DON'T GET TO DEFENSE.
>> I'M NOT.

39:47.453 --> 39:48.353
>> FOR WHAT?

39:48.386 --> 39:50.422
I WANT JESSICA OUT.

39:50.456 --> 39:51.457
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR CONCERN
IS.

39:51.490 --> 39:52.724
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

39:52.758 --> 39:55.627
>> YOU KNOW WHAT MY CONCERN IS.
>> I'M SAYING IF YOU DON'T WANT

39:55.661 --> 39:58.430
TO GO UP, I ASKED YOU FOR A
SUGGESTION.

39:58.464 --> 40:01.032
YOU SAID PAUL --
>> DIDN'T I TELL YOU TO PUT ALEX

40:01.066 --> 40:01.700
AND PAUL?

40:01.733 --> 40:03.168
YOU ASKED FOR SUGGESTIONS.

40:03.201 --> 40:06.938
>> IF YOU'RE GOING TO LIE,
YOU'RE GOING UP AS A PAWN.

40:06.972 --> 40:08.173
YOU WANT TO HUG IT OUT?

40:08.206 --> 40:09.708
>> I DON'T WANT A HUG.

40:09.741 --> 40:10.275
DON'T TOUCH ME.

40:10.308 --> 40:11.510
>> WHY ARE YOU SO UPSET?

40:11.543 --> 40:13.745
>> I'M NOT LYING.

40:13.779 --> 40:15.380
THAT'S WHAT I GET PISSED ABOUT.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.915
I 100% DID NOT LIE.

40:16.948 --> 40:20.118
>> I CAN'T MAKE UP A
CONVERSATION.

40:20.151 --> 40:21.386
WITH ARE YOU LYING?

40:21.419 --> 40:24.122
>> JOSH, I'M FURIOUS WITH YOU
RIGHT NOW.

40:24.155 --> 40:28.527
YOU DID NOT ASK ME FOR
SUGGESTIONS.

40:28.560 --> 40:30.762
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

40:30.796 --> 40:40.839
>> I'M DONE .
>> THIS IS A NOMINATION

40:40.839 --> 40:50.849
>> I'M DONE .
>> THIS IS A NOMINATION

40:59.925 --> 41:01.126
CEREMONY.

41:01.159 --> 41:02.894
IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY AS A HEAD
OF HOUSEHOLD TO NOMINATE TWO

41:02.928 --> 41:05.964
HOUSE GUESTS FOR EVICTION.

41:05.997 --> 41:08.700
JESSICA, BECAUSE YOU CAME IN
LAST IN THE TEMPTATION

41:08.734 --> 41:13.572
COMPETITION, YOU'RE ALREADY ON
THE BLOCK AS A SPECIAL THIRD

41:13.605 --> 41:14.573
NOMINEE.

41:14.606 --> 41:19.678
NOW IT'S TIME FOR ME TO REVEAL
MY TWO NOMINEES.

41:19.711 --> 41:25.350
MY NOMINATION BLOCK ARE THE KEYS
OF THE HOUSE GUESTS THAT I'M

41:25.383 --> 41:29.521
NOMINATING FOR EVICTION.

41:29.555 --> 41:34.259
I WILL TURN IN TWO KEYS AND
THEIR FACES WILL APPEAR ON THE

41:34.292 --> 41:35.493
MEMORY WALL.

41:35.527 --> 41:46.972
THE FIRST HOUSE GUEST I HAVE
NOMINATED IS -- THE NEXT HOUSE

41:47.005 --> 41:57.048
GUEST I HAVE NOMINATED IS -- I
HAVE NOMINATED YOU, MARK AND

41:57.048 --> 42:05.290
GUEST I HAVE NOMINATED IS -- I
HAVE NOMINATED YOU, MARK AND

42:05.323 --> 42:06.858
YOU, ELENA.

42:06.892 --> 42:14.365
MARK, YOU'VE BEEN TRYING TO BE
PART OF THE FAMILIA.

42:14.399 --> 42:21.172
IN MY EYES, YOU ALWAYS BE A
MEATBALL.

42:21.206 --> 42:22.373
NOW, DOWN TO BUSINESS.

42:22.407 --> 42:26.578
JESS, YOU DECIDED TO PLAY CODY'S
GAME AND TAKE A SHOT AT ME.

42:26.612 --> 42:31.182
NOW I'M UP FOR REVENGE AND
EVERYBODY KNOWS I'M GUNNING FOR

42:31.216 --> 42:31.583
YOU.

42:31.617 --> 42:35.053
>> OH, MY GOD.

42:35.086 --> 42:38.223
>> IS THIS THE JOSH SHOW?

42:38.256 --> 42:39.290
>> IT IS.

42:39.324 --> 42:46.131
THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY IS
ADJOURNED.

42:46.164 --> 42:48.099
>> SO I'M OFFICIALLY ON THE
BLOCK.

42:48.133 --> 42:50.435
THAT MEANS THAT I JUST GET TO
COMPETE IN VETO.

42:50.468 --> 42:51.637
CODY IS SAFE.

42:51.670 --> 43:00.211
THE FUNNY THING IS, THEY DON'T
REALIZE THIS IS PART OF OUR

43:00.245 --> 43:00.746
PLAN.

43:00.779 --> 43:01.947
I'M NOT GIVING UP YET.

43:01.980 --> 43:07.185
>> I'M ON THE BLOCK, WHICH IS
HARD ENOUGH.

43:07.218 --> 43:09.420
KNOWING THAT ELENA IS NEXT TO ME
IS WORSE.

43:09.454 --> 43:13.291
EITHER WAY, I'M GOING TO WIN THE
VETO SO I CAN COME OFF THE BLOCK

43:13.324 --> 43:13.859
AND FEEL SAFE.

43:13.892 --> 43:15.193
>> SO I'M ANNOYED.

43:15.226 --> 43:18.630
EVEN THOUGH JESSICA IS A TARGET,
THERE'S A DEFINITE POSSIBILITY

43:18.664 --> 43:20.231
I'M GOING HOME.

43:20.265 --> 43:23.935
EVEN BEST WORST CASE SCENARIO,
JESSICA WINS VETO AND MARK GOES

43:23.969 --> 43:24.535
HOME.

43:24.569 --> 43:26.237
I DON'T LIKE THAT EITHER.

43:26.271 --> 43:29.507
>> LISTEN, MEATBALLS, I WAS
LYING IN MY SPEECH.

43:29.540 --> 43:31.009
GET THE OSCAR READY.

43:31.042 --> 43:33.645
I WANT THE HOUSE TO THINK I'M
TARGETING JESSICA.

43:33.679 --> 43:37.182
LITTLE DO THEY KNOW I WANT ELENA
OUT THIS WEEK.

43:37.215 --> 43:38.183
SORRY, ELENA.

43:38.216 --> 43:40.585
YOUR TIME IS RUNNING SHORT AND
YOU HAVE TO GO.

43:40.618 --> 43:41.820
IT'S BEEN REAL, BOO BOO.

43:41.853 --> 43:47.158
>> WITH THE POWER OF VETO UP FOR
GRABS, WILL CODY AND JESSICA

43:47.192 --> 43:52.764
DEFY THE ODDS AND STAY SAFE THIS
WEEK?

43:52.798 --> 43:57.068
FIND OUT WEDNESDAY ON "BIG
BROTHER"!
