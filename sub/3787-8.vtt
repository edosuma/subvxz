WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:03.503
Thank you, everyone, for staying late

00:03.505 --> 00:05.555
to learn our new iPad order system.

00:05.795 --> 00:09.830
We had no choice, you locked the door from the outside.

00:10.399 --> 00:13.467
Either way, we're learning.

00:13.510 --> 00:16.361
Han, why would we update our order system

00:16.363 --> 00:18.297
when our uniforms are from the 1970's

00:18.299 --> 00:21.133
and our paycheck is from the 1800s?

00:21.135 --> 00:23.135
Let's get to the tutorial.

00:23.137 --> 00:25.387
Max, you and I are going to role-play.

00:25.389 --> 00:27.064
All right, you can be the little bitch,

00:27.064 --> 00:28.674
and I'll be me.

00:28.689 --> 00:30.272
I don't need this lesson.

00:30.274 --> 00:32.323
I'm very familiar with the touch screen.

00:32.326 --> 00:36.027
Let's just say I put the "goo" in Google.

00:36.029 --> 00:38.280
I'm going to pretend I'm a customer,

00:38.282 --> 00:40.282
and order a hamburger.

00:40.284 --> 00:43.868
Hello, miss. I'll have a hamburger.

00:43.870 --> 00:48.290
Certainly, miss.

00:48.292 --> 00:52.877
Would you like that with or without salmonella?

00:52.879 --> 00:56.631
Han, I got my first lesson on the iPad from Steve Jobs,

00:56.633 --> 00:59.384
and now I'm getting it from Han Jobs?

00:59.386 --> 01:02.721
Caroline, don't act like you know more about gadgets than me.

01:02.723 --> 01:05.974
Formerly rich doesn't beat currently Asian.

01:08.144 --> 01:11.396
Now, come on, everyone look at their iPads.

01:11.398 --> 01:14.482
What iPad? I didn't see an iPad

01:14.484 --> 01:16.484
What? No.

01:16.486 --> 01:18.153
Did somebody say something about an iPad?

01:18.155 --> 01:20.872
What the hell is an iPad?

01:20.874 --> 01:23.208
Where did they all go?

01:23.210 --> 01:26.161
I'm guessing eBay.

01:26.163 --> 01:28.663
I want them all back, especially mine.

01:28.665 --> 01:33.051
I'm in a casual flirtation with a woman in Australia.

01:33.053 --> 01:36.921
She's part aboriginal, but has a great personality.

01:57.659 --> 01:59.277
Here you go, Earl.

01:59.279 --> 02:03.281
Max, what's wrong? You seem happy.

02:03.283 --> 02:07.315
I'm just still on a high from this $10,000 bank loan

02:07.316 --> 02:08.953
I got last week.

02:08.955 --> 02:13.958
And from an almost certainly laced pot brownie I ate in 2004.

02:14.055 --> 02:16.450
I can't believe you and Caroline got a bank loan

02:16.451 --> 02:17.640
for your cupcake business,

02:17.642 --> 02:21.560
and not a single hostage was involved.

02:21.562 --> 02:23.979
Max, you don't have $10,000.

02:23.981 --> 02:26.065
You don't even have Netflix.

02:26.067 --> 02:29.118
This money is to pay a factory to make our cupcake T-shirts,

02:29.120 --> 02:31.237
and I've whittled it down to three.

02:31.239 --> 02:32.288
Hello.

02:32.290 --> 02:34.390
Speaking of whittled.

02:35.068 --> 02:37.564
Someone used my printer, and I'm guessing it's Caroline,

02:37.566 --> 02:38.977
'cause it's about business

02:38.977 --> 02:42.569
and not another one of Earl's Angela Bassett collages.

02:42.571 --> 02:46.824
What can I say, man? I'm a Bassett hound.

02:46.826 --> 02:48.292
Oh, thanks, Han.

02:48.294 --> 02:49.743
These are the factories I've been researching.

02:49.745 --> 02:51.962
We want our T-shirts to be American made.

02:51.964 --> 02:53.797
I have an American maid,

02:53.799 --> 02:56.300
and all she's good at is eating my granola bars.

02:57.836 --> 03:00.137
Look, Max, I found one right here in Brooklyn.

03:00.139 --> 03:02.423
"American Ace. The founder, Ace Hardwick,

03:02.425 --> 03:04.758
is devoted to treating his workers well,"

03:04.760 --> 03:07.578
and not in a creepy way like that American Apparel guy.

03:07.580 --> 03:08.929
So you're saying none of these workers

03:08.931 --> 03:11.181
have ever found an Ace in their hole?

03:12.851 --> 03:15.769
Look, I've worked in a lot of factories.

03:15.771 --> 03:17.821
I know what goes on.

03:17.823 --> 03:19.323
I worked in a coat factory,

03:19.325 --> 03:22.693
which is why my lungs are coated in asbestos.

03:22.695 --> 03:24.445
I worked in an underwear factory,

03:24.447 --> 03:28.031
where I was underpaid for the fruits of my looms,

03:28.033 --> 03:31.285
and worst factory of all, The Cheesecake Factory.

03:31.287 --> 03:33.287
Oh.

03:33.289 --> 03:34.955
How about we do a walk-through tomorrow

03:34.957 --> 03:36.623
to make sure it's up to snuff?

03:36.625 --> 03:37.841
Well, if they have snuff,

03:37.843 --> 03:40.511
why are we waiting till tomorrow?

03:40.513 --> 03:44.148
Hey, everybody!

03:44.150 --> 03:47.718
Oh, hey. Hi, great news!

03:47.720 --> 03:51.889
I just got carded at Buffalo Wild Wings!

03:51.891 --> 03:55.976
Really? I got carted out of there once.

03:55.978 --> 03:58.028
And more great news:

03:58.030 --> 04:00.531
I'm starting my own new business.

04:00.533 --> 04:04.201
So girls, you know how you have that $10,000?

04:04.203 --> 04:06.904
Well, I don't want to clean you out,

04:06.906 --> 04:10.073
but how do you feel about tossing me $9,500?

04:11.976 --> 04:15.329
You two should invest. Sophie's business is genius.

04:15.331 --> 04:18.415
You know how a bunch of ladies got their down-there-hair

04:18.416 --> 04:20.750
permanently lasered off?

04:20.753 --> 04:24.004
Yeah, that's when your waxer gives you a Michael Chiklis.

04:24.006 --> 04:25.339
Yeah.

04:25.341 --> 04:27.841
Well, Sophie's offering a product

04:27.843 --> 04:30.027
that puts grass back on your field.

04:30.029 --> 04:32.162
Yeah.

04:32.164 --> 04:36.433
That's not a business. That's nobody's business.

04:36.435 --> 04:38.018
Yeah, I don't do any of that stuff.

04:38.020 --> 04:41.605
I just throw a scrunchie on mine and go.

04:41.607 --> 04:45.192
Hey, there's a need for this. Sometimes, in the fog,

04:45.194 --> 04:49.530
my plane gets lost without a landing strip.

04:49.532 --> 04:51.865
We're out.

04:51.867 --> 04:54.201
Oh, don't decide yet, girls.

04:54.203 --> 04:56.737
you haven't even heard the cute, little name.

04:56.739 --> 05:00.207
"Sophie Kuchenksi's Vagina Wigs!"

05:01.793 --> 05:04.461
Yeah, we're really out.

05:04.463 --> 05:07.548
Oh. But it's a quality product,

05:07.550 --> 05:11.785
and it's real hair imported from "Va-China."

05:11.787 --> 05:15.272
Yeah, never been further out.

05:19.060 --> 05:20.561
And this is our main floor.

05:20.563 --> 05:23.814
Wow, this is amazing!

05:23.816 --> 05:26.600
I feel like we're in the Willy Wonka Factory.

05:26.602 --> 05:29.069
I know, right?

05:29.071 --> 05:32.456
The American Ace motto is "work is fun""

05:32.458 --> 05:35.158
Max was expecting a different kind of factory.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.411
More torture, less foosball.

05:37.413 --> 05:41.748
I know, right? Not at American Ace.

05:41.750 --> 05:43.250
And what is your position here, Peggy?

05:43.252 --> 05:45.669
Are you the "I know, right?" person?

05:45.671 --> 05:48.922
I know, right?

05:48.924 --> 05:52.976
No, I'm one of the owners. Also, I dye T-shirts.

05:52.978 --> 05:55.512
See, every employee gets a percentage of the company

05:55.514 --> 05:59.433
after six months, so the longer you stay, the more it grows.

05:59.435 --> 06:01.101
We've been at the diner four years,

06:01.103 --> 06:04.771
and the only thing we've seen grow is Oleg's pants.

06:04.773 --> 06:07.824
I know, right?

06:09.661 --> 06:12.946
Well, Ace is expecting you. Go ahead, go have fun!

06:14.617 --> 06:17.618
Hey, don't be fooled by what's on the surface.

06:17.620 --> 06:19.119
You look like you have money,

06:19.121 --> 06:21.204
but I know your underwear's in shreds.

06:21.206 --> 06:23.340
Not shreds, Max, shred.

06:23.342 --> 06:26.126
Just one, it goes from front to back.

06:27.679 --> 06:30.881
Um, hi, should we just come in? The door is open.

06:30.883 --> 06:32.299
Yep, always is.

06:32.301 --> 06:35.719
Doors create boundaries. Boundaries are a bummer.

06:35.721 --> 06:37.137
You know what else is a bummer?

06:37.139 --> 06:41.058
Tall guys with small penises?

06:41.060 --> 06:45.545
That you just missed the gelato and designer coffee cart.

06:45.547 --> 06:47.981
Espresso hazelnut praline?

06:47.983 --> 06:49.866
We're not here for gelato.

06:49.868 --> 06:52.202
We're not not here for gelato.

06:53.404 --> 06:54.988
Awesome. It's awesome to meet you.

06:54.990 --> 06:56.490
I'm Ace Hardwick.

06:56.492 --> 07:00.327
Look, "Ace", we're not about to give you $10,000

07:00.329 --> 07:03.213
so you can take advantage of a sad, underage girl worker

07:03.215 --> 07:05.549
near the loading docks 'cause her boobs are crazy big

07:05.551 --> 07:07.834
and she needs a ride home.

07:07.836 --> 07:10.387
That's a "for instance."

07:10.389 --> 07:11.722
I'm sorry?

07:11.724 --> 07:14.007
See, Ace, Max has some trust issues

07:14.009 --> 07:16.677
when it comes to factories, so, we're here today to...

07:16.679 --> 07:18.562
You're pretty much eating cardboard there.

07:18.564 --> 07:20.564
You want me to get you another?

07:20.566 --> 07:23.350
You should see her with tuna cans.

07:23.352 --> 07:26.103
Hey, I see the prosciutto cart.

07:26.105 --> 07:28.689
Who wants imported ham?

07:28.691 --> 07:30.190
Me!

07:30.192 --> 07:33.944
Well, we're not not here for prosciutto.

07:33.946 --> 07:35.362
Hey, you know what's cool?

07:35.364 --> 07:37.948
Short guys with big penises?

07:37.950 --> 07:41.368
You're fun.

07:41.370 --> 07:43.787
Your business belongs here at American Ace.

07:43.789 --> 07:46.039
Come on, let's go meet the family.

07:46.041 --> 07:48.125
That guy kind of creeps me out.

07:48.127 --> 07:52.212
On the plus side, I finally get to meet my family.

07:53.715 --> 07:56.049
I had this space designed for open energy

07:56.051 --> 07:57.551
and open conversation.

07:57.553 --> 07:59.553
What's up, other owners?

07:59.555 --> 08:01.254
What's up, Ace?

08:01.256 --> 08:04.057
Our sales, by 400%!

08:07.730 --> 08:10.731
Max, this is it. This is our factory.

08:10.733 --> 08:13.066
The employees look happy and successful.

08:13.068 --> 08:17.571
So did the members of 'N Sync.

08:17.573 --> 08:21.408
but behind the curtain, a veil of tears.

08:21.410 --> 08:23.744
Hey, Caroline, here's the prosciutto cart.

08:23.746 --> 08:26.246
Thanks, Ace!

08:26.248 --> 08:27.631
Enjoy. I'm just gonna get

08:27.633 --> 08:30.801
a quick five-minute chair massage.

08:30.803 --> 08:34.004
Come on, let's slip out while Ace has got his head

08:34.006 --> 08:36.756
stuck in that chair's ass.

08:36.759 --> 08:38.759
Hey, what's up?

08:38.760 --> 08:41.428
Welcome to American Ace. I'm Rico.

08:41.429 --> 08:44.648
You're, like, really, really, really pretty.

08:44.650 --> 08:47.317
Aw... oh!

08:47.319 --> 08:51.271
So anyways, I'm part owner, and I clean the bathroom.

08:51.273 --> 08:55.609
Hmm, quick question: do you have a light Cabernet?

08:55.611 --> 08:57.277
Quicker question:

08:57.279 --> 09:00.530
where's the secret room with the toddler slaves?

09:00.532 --> 09:04.634
What's up? I'm Raul, part owner and security guard.

09:04.636 --> 09:06.787
Hey, you two want to grab a drink sometime?

09:06.789 --> 09:11.958
Fridays after work, we all hang next door at Tortilla Flats.

09:11.960 --> 09:15.378
Tortilla Flat. Wasn't that your stripper name?

09:15.380 --> 09:18.014
You're just jealous 'cause mine's taller

09:18.016 --> 09:21.351
and thinks I'm really, really, really pretty.

09:21.353 --> 09:24.137
Good luck with that tall guy scenario.

09:32.825 --> 09:35.076
Sorry we're late, but we were busy with our other business,

09:35.078 --> 09:37.328
the one we care about.

09:37.330 --> 09:41.132
How can I be mad with that sincere, heartfelt apology?

09:42.751 --> 09:44.836
Who wants to see our sample T-shirts?

09:44.838 --> 09:47.672
I want to see it, but I want to see a lot of things.

09:47.674 --> 09:50.341
With these damn cataracts, the best I can do

09:50.343 --> 09:55.546
is look towards it and get a milky idea.

09:55.548 --> 09:57.181
Hey, girls!

09:57.183 --> 09:58.933
I want to show you some of my new styles

09:58.935 --> 10:02.186
for my "Everybody's Merkin for the Weekend" collection.

10:02.188 --> 10:04.689
Sophie, what's a merkin?

10:04.691 --> 10:07.108
It's a vagina wig.

10:07.110 --> 10:10.445
Oh, that's dirty.

10:12.281 --> 10:14.699
And Han, I'm gonna need your input,

10:14.701 --> 10:18.236
because I'm working on an Asian line.

10:18.238 --> 10:20.705
Shouldn't Han grow some hair on his

10:20.707 --> 10:23.041
before he starts tossing out advice?

10:23.043 --> 10:25.877
Han, I need to know if I got the texture right,

10:25.879 --> 10:29.697
so come over here.

10:29.699 --> 10:32.884
Oh, yeah.

10:32.886 --> 10:36.387
Yeah, that feels nice. Ohh.

10:36.389 --> 10:37.805
Ohh.

10:37.807 --> 10:41.726
Yeah, nice and thick between my fingers.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.811
Oh, yeah.

10:43.813 --> 10:47.565
Slower.

10:47.567 --> 10:51.919
Slower still.

10:51.921 --> 10:55.723
This is like watching your gerbil hump a pencil.

10:58.744 --> 11:02.013
Not really sexual, but still grosses you out.

11:03.465 --> 11:05.583
Sophie, I... I think you should stop.

11:05.585 --> 11:08.002
I haven't felt this sensation since third grade

11:08.004 --> 11:10.421
when Madam Yi checked me for head lice.

11:12.758 --> 11:15.319
Remind me to pick up a "What's Happening To My Body?"

11:15.320 --> 11:17.762
book for Han tomorrow.

11:17.764 --> 11:20.164
Oh, girls, I'll be over here,

11:20.166 --> 11:22.800
working on my African/American line.

11:22.802 --> 11:27.989
Yeah, I can't decide whether to call it a "vag-afr""

11:27.991 --> 11:33.761
or a "Pube-a Gooding, Jr""

11:36.265 --> 11:39.367
Max, look. These shirts look amazing.

11:39.369 --> 11:41.619
Well, I guess I was wrong about the factory.

11:41.621 --> 11:42.954
Like I was wrong about you

11:42.956 --> 11:46.457
making it through that first winter.

11:46.459 --> 11:48.292
Look, there's a note in here.

11:48.294 --> 11:51.045
Oh, it's probably from Rico. He's obsessed with me.

11:51.047 --> 11:53.297
Yeah, it's not from him.

11:53.299 --> 11:55.133
It says, "Help us""

11:55.135 --> 11:59.187
Underpaid workers are trapped in that factory, I knew it!

11:59.189 --> 12:02.306
Once again, I was fooled by ice cream.

12:02.308 --> 12:04.692
Yes, it's a note that says, "Help us,"

12:04.694 --> 12:06.861
but if there's one thing I learned in business school,

12:06.863 --> 12:10.148
it's if you don't see it, it doesn't exist.

12:10.150 --> 12:14.902
Look, as much as we want to, we can't just look away.

12:14.904 --> 12:17.071
We need to talk to the workers.

12:17.073 --> 12:18.906
Call the guy, the one who thinks you're pretty.

12:18.908 --> 12:20.408
I don't know who you're talking about.

12:20.410 --> 12:21.759
I only met a guy who thought

12:21.761 --> 12:24.379
I was really, really, really pretty.

12:24.381 --> 12:26.848
We can meet them at that Mexican place.

12:26.850 --> 12:29.000
Ooh, a Mexican place!

12:29.002 --> 12:32.336
I forgot about the Latina market!

12:32.338 --> 12:36.147
Girls, when you're there, find out if they'd be interested

12:36.147 --> 12:38.926
in some hair south of the border.

12:41.764 --> 12:44.348
Didn't know if you ladies wanted beers or margaritas,

12:44.350 --> 12:45.933
so we got you Beer-garitas.

12:45.935 --> 12:49.737
It's five bucks, but you're worth it.

12:49.739 --> 12:52.740
I love a girl with a healthy appetite.

12:52.742 --> 12:54.075
Well, you're gonna be getting down on one knee

12:54.077 --> 12:57.111
before the end of the appetizers.

12:57.113 --> 13:00.198
So let's just dive right in. How's factory life treating you?

13:00.200 --> 13:02.200
Give us the skinny... which is what I hope you said

13:02.202 --> 13:03.785
when you ordered those Beer-garitas,

13:03.787 --> 13:06.587
'cause I cannot be poor with a muffin top.

13:06.589 --> 13:08.456
You know, I don't want to talk about work.

13:08.458 --> 13:11.092
Oh, are you saying you're not allowed to talk about work?

13:11.094 --> 13:14.929
Your words, we all heard you, Rico or Raul.

13:14.931 --> 13:16.798
Hey, tell me, what do you girls like to do?

13:16.800 --> 13:19.717
Mm, I like to watch waiters make guacamole at my table.

13:19.719 --> 13:20.935
When's that gonna happen?

13:22.055 --> 13:25.056
So about work... Yeah, okay.

13:25.058 --> 13:28.226
Hey, let's go see what's going on in Beer-garitaville.

13:30.979 --> 13:32.897
What are we gonna do? I can't get any information

13:32.899 --> 13:34.615
out of Rico. He's so preoccupied

13:34.617 --> 13:37.068
with how pretty, pretty, pretty I am.

13:37.070 --> 13:39.403
Oh, hi, Peggy. How are you?

13:39.405 --> 13:41.572
Would you like to join us and talk about work?

13:41.574 --> 13:43.958
Why don't we talk about you two skanks

13:43.960 --> 13:47.061
gettin' the hell outta here?

13:47.063 --> 13:51.265
And I thought we were bad waitresses.

13:51.267 --> 13:54.635
This is Carmen. She works at the factory too.

13:54.637 --> 13:57.672
We're BFFs, and she's one of the owners, like me.

13:57.674 --> 14:02.760
Yeah, and she's a 100% owner of Rico, so hands off.

14:02.762 --> 14:05.096
We seen you two sittin' over here

14:05.098 --> 14:07.331
like you're God's friggin' gift.

14:08.634 --> 14:11.335
I know, right? And not for nothing,

14:11.337 --> 14:16.190
but Rico's pit bull doesn't like other girls.

14:18.026 --> 14:20.444
I'm guessing that's his pit bull.

14:24.533 --> 14:28.119
And you, hands off Raul.

14:28.121 --> 14:31.956
We have a love that is deep and real,

14:31.958 --> 14:35.943
and when he finds out about it, it's gonna be magic.

14:45.504 --> 14:50.269
Yup... Exactly what I expected.

14:50.269 --> 14:52.206
Upstairs is Willy Wonka's factory,

14:52.206 --> 14:55.207
and down here, they're waterboarding Oompa Loompas.

14:57.827 --> 15:00.212
Yo, what's up? We just comin' here to work

15:00.214 --> 15:03.332
in the dye room right there as per usual.

15:03.334 --> 15:06.752
Yeah, no biggie. What yous twos lookin' at?

15:10.256 --> 15:12.174
That was a really good accent.

15:12.176 --> 15:14.226
Thanks. I played Rizzo in Grease.

15:14.228 --> 15:15.677
Should have been Sandy, but I let

15:15.679 --> 15:17.679
the girl with the limp have it.

15:17.681 --> 15:21.233
Come on, we have to put these on and go into the dye room,

15:21.235 --> 15:24.269
cause I'm guessing that's where it all goes down.

15:24.271 --> 15:25.938
The dye room, I'm not surprised.

15:25.940 --> 15:28.240
I always knew we'd dye together.

15:29.859 --> 15:32.694
Okay, we'll just pretend to be working here,

15:32.696 --> 15:35.114
like we do at the diner.

15:35.116 --> 15:37.366
Well, well, look who it is,

15:37.368 --> 15:42.287
Stuck-Up and Stuck-Up Two: The Legend Returns.

15:42.289 --> 15:46.792
Max, we gotta go. My life can't end wearing grey.

15:46.794 --> 15:48.594
What up, ladies?

15:48.596 --> 15:50.796
Last night, you're hanging with the homies,

15:50.798 --> 15:54.466
and today, boom, you just happen to be working here.

15:54.468 --> 15:57.269
That's friggin' convenient.

15:57.271 --> 15:58.554
I know, right?

15:58.556 --> 16:01.056
Very friggin' convenient.

16:01.058 --> 16:03.108
I know, right?

16:03.110 --> 16:05.894
We just have to show them who's boss.

16:05.896 --> 16:06.895
You know, like we do with the mouse

16:06.897 --> 16:08.730
who lives in our toaster.

16:08.732 --> 16:13.152
So, what, we're gonna scream and then spray Windex at them?

16:13.154 --> 16:16.238
Yo! See this scar?

16:16.240 --> 16:19.241
Knife fight with five Catholic schoolgirls

16:19.243 --> 16:21.627
over a slushie. So unless you want

16:21.629 --> 16:24.496
some of what I gave Virginia, Stephanie, Laquetia, Latoya,

16:24.498 --> 16:28.467
and the one in the wheelchair, I'd stay clear.

16:28.469 --> 16:30.919
This is just a misunderstanding.

16:30.921 --> 16:32.754
Rico's not interested in me.

16:32.756 --> 16:35.090
Well, he seemed pretty into you last night.

16:35.092 --> 16:38.093
Huh, yeah, but that's before she talked.

16:38.095 --> 16:43.098
Come on, we are not interested in your men at all.

16:43.100 --> 16:45.651
Not at all. I mean, come on.

16:45.653 --> 16:47.819
What's that mean?

16:47.821 --> 16:50.155
You're saying something's wrong with them?

16:50.157 --> 16:53.525
No, she's not saying that It's just...

16:53.527 --> 16:57.362
It's just what?

16:57.364 --> 17:00.332
We're lovers.

17:03.670 --> 17:06.288
You two are lovers? 'Cause you don't seem...

17:06.290 --> 17:09.040
We don't seem what? Gay?

17:09.042 --> 17:12.294
No. Hot enough.

17:12.296 --> 17:15.012
Well...

17:15.015 --> 17:16.882
Not hot at all.

17:16.884 --> 17:19.800
I know, right?

17:19.803 --> 17:22.387
Look busy, keep your eyes open.

17:22.388 --> 17:24.388
I think we're in the belly of the beast.

17:24.391 --> 17:27.059
You talkin' about me?

17:27.060 --> 17:29.478
No.

17:33.983 --> 17:37.069
Max, what do you think's behind that locked door?

17:37.071 --> 17:40.489
I knew it! Toddler slaves.

17:40.491 --> 17:44.660
Those kids are in horrible danger of becoming... me.

17:44.662 --> 17:46.828
Come on, let's go over there.

17:50.383 --> 17:52.668
What the... you hit me!

17:52.670 --> 17:54.836
Sorry, so sorry. Accident!

17:54.838 --> 17:57.172
You throw like a girl.

17:57.174 --> 18:00.342
See, I knew it, you two aren't gay.

18:00.344 --> 18:02.511
Yous are after our guys!

18:02.513 --> 18:04.096
No, I'm not! Rico just thought I was

18:04.098 --> 18:05.347
really, really, really pretty.

18:07.233 --> 18:11.186
Oh, hell no! Leave my lover alone!

18:11.188 --> 18:13.939
Oh!

18:13.941 --> 18:15.574
It's on!

18:15.576 --> 18:17.109
No! No!

18:17.111 --> 18:19.361
It's... no, no, no, no, no! It's not on.

18:19.363 --> 18:21.196
This is silly. We're not after anyone.

18:21.198 --> 18:23.582
we're here to help some of those work...

18:23.584 --> 18:26.702
Oh, yeah. Now, it's on!

18:28.454 --> 18:30.372
Oh! I warn you!

18:32.376 --> 18:35.010
Oh, hell no!

18:38.381 --> 18:40.048
Back off, bitch!

18:40.050 --> 18:43.385
Who you calling bitch, bitch?

18:47.774 --> 18:51.276
Honey? You're getting carried away.

18:53.230 --> 18:54.913
Now you're really getting carried away.

18:54.915 --> 18:56.732
Oh, no! Don't put me in the dryer!

18:56.734 --> 18:58.900
I used to be rich, I'm dry clean only!

19:04.824 --> 19:06.575
Oh! Oh!

19:10.747 --> 19:14.166
That was a big friggin' mistake!

19:18.004 --> 19:20.255
Respect.

19:20.257 --> 19:21.640
You two are a lot tougher

19:21.642 --> 19:23.592
than those girls from Saint Bridget's.

19:25.178 --> 19:28.430
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's happening?

19:28.432 --> 19:32.100
We're busting you. We know what's happening here.

19:32.102 --> 19:35.270
What, profit sharing and healthcare?

19:35.272 --> 19:39.691
We found a note in our box with "help us" scrawled on it.

19:39.693 --> 19:41.026
How do you explain that?

19:41.944 --> 19:43.028
Did you read the back?

19:43.030 --> 19:44.946
Heh heh heh.

19:44.948 --> 19:47.499
"Help us...

19:47.501 --> 19:50.001
help you...

19:50.003 --> 19:53.622
to your full potential at American Ace"

19:53.624 --> 19:56.508
We put one in every box we ship.

19:56.510 --> 19:57.876
I have got to start reading

19:57.878 --> 19:59.961
more than the first sentence of stuff.

20:04.300 --> 20:06.468
I'm sorry, this is all my fault.

20:06.470 --> 20:07.843
I guess I just wanted to believe

20:07.843 --> 20:11.807
some kids were having a worse childhood than I was.

20:11.809 --> 20:14.976
Max, don't feel bad. You thought someone needed help,

20:14.978 --> 20:16.978
and you cared, and that makes you a good person,

20:16.980 --> 20:18.480
and I'm proud of you.

20:18.482 --> 20:21.983
I said I was sorry. You don't have to be mean.

20:21.985 --> 20:26.171
Hey, everybody!

20:26.173 --> 20:28.473
I just got my first shipment of wigs.

20:31.911 --> 20:34.329
Sophie, why are you walking like that?

20:34.331 --> 20:37.082
Well, I'm not just the president,

20:37.084 --> 20:39.551
I'm also a client.

20:45.224 --> 20:47.392
Sophie, I think you dropped something,

20:47.394 --> 20:51.396
unless we have those giant Persian roaches again.

20:51.398 --> 20:55.484
Even a milky version of that was too much.

21:03.025 --> 21:05.861
You know, Max, maybe someday, someone like you will come

21:05.863 --> 21:08.864
into this Salmonella factory and rescue us.

21:08.866 --> 21:10.532
What are you writing on those checks?

21:10.534 --> 21:12.617
"Help us"

21:12.619 --> 21:16.455
We work here. The "help us" is implied.
