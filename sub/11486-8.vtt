00:05.200 --> 00:08.636
- Hey, how do I look?
- Incredible.

00:09.440 --> 00:12.796
All men want to be you,
all women want to be with you.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.875
Could you at least look at me
before you answer?

00:17.640 --> 00:19.437
I stand corrected.

00:20.920 --> 00:22.512
All men want to be with you...

00:22.680 --> 00:25.797
Charlie, come on.
I'm really nervous here.

00:25.960 --> 00:28.679
This is my first real date since college.

00:30.800 --> 00:33.234
- What the hell is this?
- Bourbon.

00:33.960 --> 00:38.238
- You drink bourbon while you work out?
- Gin makes me sweat.

00:39.720 --> 00:42.518
Look, don't turn this into a bigger deal
than it needs to be.

00:42.680 --> 00:45.877
- You met a woman, you asked her out...
- Technically, she asked me out.

00:46.040 --> 00:49.157
See, I was in the market, and she
needed advice on picking out corn.

00:49.320 --> 00:51.515
There were no employees around.
There never are.

00:51.680 --> 00:54.513
Even if they are, they're not
knowledgeable about produce.

00:54.680 --> 00:58.593
- Thank God you were there.
- Tell me about it.

00:58.760 --> 01:00.990
I explained that you have to
husk a few ears...

01:01.160 --> 01:03.310
...to check the firmness
of the kernels.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.232
Next thing you know,
she asked me out.

01:05.400 --> 01:09.518
Well, I guess that's why they say no one
gets more action than a greengrocer.

01:09.680 --> 01:11.910
- They say that?
- No.

01:13.480 --> 01:15.311
The point is, it's just dinner.

01:15.480 --> 01:18.552
You'll go, you'll bore her to death,
you'll come home.

01:18.720 --> 01:21.359
Yeah, I know, but I wanna look good
while I'm doing it.

01:21.520 --> 01:23.590
You look fine. Just relax. Be yourself.

01:24.080 --> 01:25.638
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

01:25.800 --> 01:29.634
- You think I should bring some condoms?
- Why?

01:29.800 --> 01:32.360
Well, I see the
public service commercials...

01:32.520 --> 01:34.272
Yeah, you're right. See you later.

01:38.920 --> 01:40.797
Feel the burn.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:08.240 --> 02:09.514
I think it's going well.

02:21.280 --> 02:25.910
My God, Alan. You're like a machine.

02:26.080 --> 02:31.279
I'm a love shark, baby.
If I stop making love, I drown.

02:32.600 --> 02:35.034
Okay, okay, okay.
Wait a sec, wait a sec:

02:37.360 --> 02:39.396
Sharks don't growl.

02:39.560 --> 02:43.678
All right, I'm a love bear.

02:43.840 --> 02:47.355
If I stop making love,
I prevent forest fires.

02:48.320 --> 02:49.673
Jeez.

02:49.840 --> 02:52.308
- Alan.
- Put that out.

02:59.720 --> 03:02.188
- Morning.
- Morning.

03:04.240 --> 03:06.549
I see you've been working out again.

03:08.040 --> 03:10.315
Yeah, well, it's good for my heart.

03:10.480 --> 03:13.358
I figure the liver damage
makes it kind of a push.

03:13.520 --> 03:15.033
Morning, all.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.191
- Morning.
- Morning.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.597
Thirsty.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.752
Alan.

03:43.240 --> 03:47.870
Well, gadzooks,
Zippy's getting his freak on.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.878
Yeah, it seems we're living
in an age of miracles.

03:53.040 --> 03:55.076
I guess if they can put
a man on the moon...

03:55.240 --> 03:57.037
...they can put a woman
on your brother.

03:59.120 --> 04:01.236
- Who's the girl?
- I don't know.

04:01.400 --> 04:04.710
He met her at the supermarket.
Helped her pick out corn.

04:04.880 --> 04:07.189
Corn?

04:07.840 --> 04:11.799
Well, I'm not in any position to judge.
I once did a guy for a tank of gas.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.989
- Hey, Alan? Alan?
- Yeah?

04:38.160 --> 04:39.991
- What you got there?
- Basting brush...

04:40.160 --> 04:45.188
...chocolate sauce, rubber gloves. You
know what we're gonna use them for?

04:45.680 --> 04:48.911
- No.
- Neither do I.

04:49.680 --> 04:53.559
Charlie, I have never had sex
like this before in my life.

04:53.720 --> 04:58.157
In fact, I don't think anything I've had
prior to this can even be called sex.

04:58.320 --> 05:01.949
Because if you call that sex,
we need a new name for this.

05:02.120 --> 05:06.591
My suggestion would be
"hootenanny yum-yum."

05:07.480 --> 05:09.675
I'm happy for you.

05:09.840 --> 05:13.355
Me too. Oh, do we have a step stool?

05:13.520 --> 05:16.273
- Hallway closet.
- Thank you.

05:17.040 --> 05:20.271
- You might wanna pace yourself.
- Yeah, right.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.352
Oh, boy.

05:29.520 --> 05:33.433
- What?
- Oh, boy.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.874
Can I watch TV?

05:35.040 --> 05:37.679
I don't see why not.
You got eyes and a butt.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.232
Where's Alan?

05:41.880 --> 05:44.713
- He's here.
- Well, may I speak with him?

05:49.280 --> 05:50.633
Sure, why not.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.832
Okay, okay. Wait a sec.

05:56.240 --> 05:59.596
- Ta-da!
- Yes!

06:05.480 --> 06:07.357
Not a good time, Charlie.

06:07.520 --> 06:11.069
Well, I thought you might like to know
that your ex-wife and son are here.

06:11.240 --> 06:13.196
She's supposed to bring him on Friday.

06:13.360 --> 06:15.112
It is Friday.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.718
But not until 5.

06:17.880 --> 06:19.950
It is 5.

06:20.120 --> 06:22.031
Okay, cover for me. I'll be right out.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.553
- Alan.
- Yeah?

06:23.720 --> 06:26.234
You might wanna take off
the rubber glove first.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.118
Good thinking.

06:32.320 --> 06:34.880
- He'll be right out.
- Thank you.

06:35.040 --> 06:36.792
So...

06:40.880 --> 06:42.154
...how are you?

06:42.320 --> 06:44.151
What's going on in there?

06:44.320 --> 06:50.031
Alan's moving furniture around,
because he's constantly redecorating.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.873
Sorry, I was taking a nap.

06:55.240 --> 06:56.468
So... So, what's up?

06:56.640 --> 07:00.394
I wanted to remind you that Jake has his
karate tournament tomorrow morning.

07:00.560 --> 07:03.757
- Okay.
- What's that on your face?

07:04.720 --> 07:09.191
- Just a little chocolate sauce.
- Thank you.

07:09.360 --> 07:11.749
Got it, karate tournament,
tomorrow morning.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.674
Alan, what's going on?

07:14.640 --> 07:19.430
What's... What's going on
is I was lying in bed...

07:19.600 --> 07:21.397
...eating a sundae.

07:23.480 --> 07:25.789
- After moving furniture.
- After moving furniture.

07:25.960 --> 07:29.839
And I fell asleep
in some chocolate sauce.

07:31.840 --> 07:33.990
Goodbye, Alan.

07:37.280 --> 07:39.589
- I think she bought it.
- You think?

07:39.760 --> 07:41.239
No.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.791
Why didn't you tell her
you've got a woman?

07:44.960 --> 07:47.155
I don't know. It just seems wrong.

07:47.320 --> 07:49.993
You're divorced.
You have nothing to feel guilty about.

07:50.160 --> 07:53.152
It's not guilt. It's more shame.

07:53.320 --> 07:56.710
- What are you ashamed of?
- Charlie, I spent 12 years with Judith.

07:56.880 --> 07:59.792
We went through a lot together.
You can't just erase all that...

07:59.960 --> 08:02.793
...by lapping chocolate sauce
out of another woman's navel.

08:04.040 --> 08:07.555
Okay, my fault for asking. Now,
what do you wanna do about Jake?

08:07.720 --> 08:11.474
Oh, my God, Jake's here.
I don't want him to know I'm dating.

08:11.640 --> 08:15.633
This is not dating, Alan.
This is rubber gloves and step stools.

08:16.720 --> 08:18.199
All right, all right.

08:18.360 --> 08:21.193
You distract him, and I'll
sneak Nancy out and drive her home.

08:21.360 --> 08:23.476
- Fine.
- Okay.

08:24.560 --> 08:29.236
Wrong. This is just wrong, so wrong.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.789
Hey, Jake, wanna go
shoot some hoops?

08:31.960 --> 08:33.678
In a minute.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.833
He's oblivious. Just go.

08:47.400 --> 08:48.992
In a minute.

08:59.680 --> 09:03.309
No, he's still watching TV.
Hold on, I'll check.

09:04.840 --> 09:07.149
- You hungry?
- What are we having?

09:07.320 --> 09:11.199
- I don't know. Tell me if you're hungry.
- That depends on what we're having.

09:11.360 --> 09:13.510
- Okay, what do you want?
- What do you got?

09:15.120 --> 09:17.031
He's not hungry.

09:18.760 --> 09:22.230
So I thought you were taking her home
and coming right back.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.868
You checked into a hotel?

09:25.560 --> 09:28.597
No, you're right,
driving that way is dangerous.

09:30.040 --> 09:32.554
One pothole
can change your life forever.

09:35.120 --> 09:40.148
When's the last time you ate something?
Quit giggling, you know what I mean.

09:43.040 --> 09:47.989
Okay. Okay, look in the honor bar
for some Gatorade or something.

09:48.160 --> 09:51.277
Dehydration is the enemy.

09:51.440 --> 09:54.273
All right, have fun. See you later.

09:54.440 --> 09:56.396
I am hungry. What's for dinner?

09:57.520 --> 09:59.795
- What do you want?
- What do you got?

10:01.400 --> 10:03.675
I think there's a couple of steaks
in the freezer.

10:03.840 --> 10:05.114
I want chicken.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.074
It's just wrong.

10:10.160 --> 10:12.833
So very, very wrong.

10:17.720 --> 10:19.790
- You full?
- Yeah.

10:19.960 --> 10:24.078
- Good.
- Why, what else we got?

10:24.640 --> 10:26.437
- You said you were full.
- I am.

10:26.600 --> 10:27.953
Good.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.791
But what else we got?

10:33.840 --> 10:37.719
Sorry, I'm late.
I had to go to the office...

10:37.880 --> 10:41.509
...for an emergency,
and I got a flat tire.

10:41.680 --> 10:45.116
And so I had to wait for the auto club
to come and change it.

10:45.280 --> 10:46.554
And I didn't have my card.

10:46.720 --> 10:48.870
And the guy had to check me
on the computer...

10:49.040 --> 10:51.554
...even though I've been a member
since 1989.

10:51.720 --> 10:56.874
And that's why it took until now
for me to get back.

10:59.480 --> 11:01.232
Thought you were here.

11:02.720 --> 11:04.233
I missed you, Alan.

11:04.400 --> 11:07.836
Thank you. Can I speak with you
for a minute?

11:08.000 --> 11:11.549
- Hey, Uncle Charlie, what's for dessert?
- You said were full.

11:12.040 --> 11:13.678
Not for dessert.

11:14.280 --> 11:17.033
- Okay, what do you want?
- What do you got?

11:17.720 --> 11:19.597
How do you not kill him?

11:22.240 --> 11:24.390
Charlie, I feel horrible
about what I'm doing.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.195
Then you're doing it wrong.

11:27.360 --> 11:30.318
No, I feel like
I'm abandoning my child.

11:30.480 --> 11:33.199
Weren't you listening?
He didn't even notice you were gone.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.634
That's not the point.

11:34.800 --> 11:38.554
What kind of man chooses sex
with an insatiably hot stranger...

11:38.720 --> 11:40.915
...over quality time with his little boy?

11:41.080 --> 11:46.154
I don't know, a man who was married
for 12 years and had sex 12 times.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.635
You're right, I deserve this.

11:49.800 --> 11:52.598
Exactly, so go enjoy yourself.

11:52.760 --> 11:54.591
Well, I do have the room
the whole night.

11:54.760 --> 11:57.479
Yeah, most of your better hotels
prefer you do it that way.

11:57.640 --> 12:00.871
Just make sure Jake goes to bed early.
He's got karate in the morning.

12:01.040 --> 12:03.838
- Which, of course, you'll be back for.
- Charlie, trust me.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.754
You, I trust.
It's him I'm worried about.

12:17.800 --> 12:19.552
What?

12:20.520 --> 12:25.799
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.
I have to take him to karate?

12:25.960 --> 12:28.554
Alan, it's 6:30 in the morning.

12:28.720 --> 12:31.314
What kind of maniac broad
did you hook up with?

12:31.480 --> 12:35.075
She's incredible, Charlie.
I've never met anyone like her.

12:39.480 --> 12:41.277
Gotta go.

12:47.440 --> 12:49.192
Jake, wake up.

12:51.720 --> 12:52.994
Well, I tried.

13:03.320 --> 13:06.551
- Anybody home?
- Right here.

13:07.880 --> 13:09.598
Where's Jake?

13:09.760 --> 13:12.433
I don't know.
Didn't he have a karate tournament?

13:14.000 --> 13:16.912
Yes. You were supposed to take him
three hours ago.

13:17.080 --> 13:20.629
- Why didn't you take him?
- He wouldn't get up.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.189
I tried everything.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.274
What time did he go to bed?

13:25.440 --> 13:28.796
I don't know. I crashed around 2
and he was still going strong.

13:30.080 --> 13:32.036
He was up past 2?

13:32.200 --> 13:35.795
He said he's had coffee before,
but that was a lie, right?

13:36.760 --> 13:40.799
Okay, okay, all right, it's not important.
The karate was his mother's idea. Listen.

13:40.960 --> 13:43.349
I need to ask you for another favor.

13:43.520 --> 13:47.798
Oh, come on, put it in the holster,
Wild Bill.

13:49.520 --> 13:52.830
No, no, no. This isn't about sex.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.514
I need you to watch Jake
for the rest of the weekend...

13:55.680 --> 13:59.036
...so that Nancy and I can go to Vegas
and get married.

14:00.160 --> 14:04.199
Oh, God, Alan. There's no need
to marry the woman.

14:04.360 --> 14:07.158
If you don't wanna have sex anymore,
just tell her.

14:07.320 --> 14:10.198
No, no, you don't understand.

14:10.360 --> 14:11.952
This is beyond sex.

14:12.120 --> 14:13.553
We're in love.

14:16.240 --> 14:17.559
Alan, come here.

14:22.560 --> 14:25.074
You are not in love, you're besotted.

14:25.240 --> 14:28.835
No, no, no, I have never felt like this
about a woman before.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.389
We have a bond
that transcends the physical.

14:31.560 --> 14:32.834
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.150
- Kind of a spiritual thing?
- Yes.

14:35.320 --> 14:38.312
Okay. I can understand that.
So where's she from?

14:38.480 --> 14:40.471
She's from around here.

14:41.160 --> 14:44.436
- Where?
- Supermarket.

14:47.480 --> 14:48.799
Charlie, stop that.

14:48.960 --> 14:54.318
I have thought this through and I am
really and truly in love with...

14:54.480 --> 14:57.074
- Nancy.
- I knew that. I knew that.

14:57.240 --> 15:00.073
I was looking for the proper adjective
to describe her.

15:00.240 --> 15:03.596
Nuts? Easy? Limber?

15:03.760 --> 15:07.912
Charlie. Charlie, you started off
on the wrong foot with my first wife.

15:08.080 --> 15:10.389
Do not make the same mistake with...

15:11.080 --> 15:12.638
...wonderful Nancy.

15:13.840 --> 15:16.832
Okay, you're right. This is not about her.
Come here. Sit down.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.390
- You gonna hit me?
- Well, let's see how it goes.

15:24.160 --> 15:27.232
Okay, look, I've never been
much of a big brother to you.

15:27.400 --> 15:30.312
I didn't protect you. I wasn't
around when you started dating...

15:30.480 --> 15:32.789
...when you got married and had Jake.
You know why?

15:33.520 --> 15:36.080
- Why?
- I was busy getting laid.

15:37.680 --> 15:40.717
Which makes me the perfect big brother
to help you now.

15:40.880 --> 15:44.111
I've been through this. I know
what it means to confuse sex with love.

15:44.280 --> 15:46.236
That's not what I'm doing, Charlie.

15:46.400 --> 15:49.870
We're talking about me, and I've
been down this road many times.

15:50.760 --> 15:52.273
I remember this one girl.

15:52.440 --> 15:54.670
We had this unbelievably
hot weekend together.

15:54.840 --> 15:57.957
It was like nothing I'd ever
experienced before, and I proposed.

15:58.120 --> 16:01.430
- I begged her to marry me.
- Wow, where did you meet?

16:01.600 --> 16:03.318
Detention.

16:04.480 --> 16:07.199
- This was in high school?
- Eighth grade.

16:07.360 --> 16:10.750
And then years later, it happened again
with a different woman.

16:10.920 --> 16:12.956
Instant chemistry.
The sex was unbelievable.

16:13.120 --> 16:15.918
I was convinced we were soul mates,
so I threw myself at her.

16:16.080 --> 16:17.911
I did everything
to get her to marry me.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.036
And you know what?
If she'd said yes...

16:20.200 --> 16:24.113
...I'd now have a 67-year-old ex-wife
on a belly dancer's pension.

16:26.200 --> 16:27.838
So, what I'm trying to say...

16:28.000 --> 16:31.072
...is you're not the first guy
to mistake passion for true love...

16:31.240 --> 16:32.593
...and you won't be the last.

16:32.760 --> 16:35.069
If someone had told me
what I'm telling you...

16:35.240 --> 16:37.993
...I could have saved myself
a lot of heartache.

16:39.120 --> 16:42.396
Okay. I hear you. Thank you.

16:42.560 --> 16:44.118
You're welcome.

16:44.280 --> 16:48.432
So make sure Jake doesn't fill up on junk
food, and I'll call you from Circus Circus.

16:51.240 --> 16:52.514
Circus Circus?

16:52.680 --> 16:56.719
You're right, money should be no object.
What's the hotel with the pirate show?

16:57.600 --> 17:00.034
I'm sorry, Alan,
but I'm gonna have to knock you out.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.839
- Hello?
- Mom, thank God you're here.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.388
Oh, I don't need
your sarcasm, Charlie.

17:05.560 --> 17:07.868
No, I mean it. I need you.
Alan needs you.

17:08.040 --> 17:09.314
What's going on?

17:09.480 --> 17:11.630
Alan, tell Mom your plans
for the weekend.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.356
- No.
- Why? Embarrassed?

17:14.520 --> 17:16.112
- No. No.
- Ashamed?

17:16.280 --> 17:18.191
- Scared?
- Yes.

17:18.880 --> 17:21.678
Sweetheart, I'm your mother.
You can tell me anything.

17:22.640 --> 17:27.794
Okay. I met a wonderful woman
in the supermarket a few days ago...

17:27.960 --> 17:30.633
...and we're getting married.

17:31.240 --> 17:33.071
I see.

17:35.320 --> 17:41.031
For God's sake, if you're that horny,
find a nice call girl, put her on retainer.

17:42.680 --> 17:44.398
This is not about sex.

17:44.560 --> 17:46.278
Oh, please. What else could it be?

17:46.440 --> 17:49.955
- Well, it could be love.
- Yeah. Sure.

17:50.120 --> 17:52.918
Who is this woman?
What does she do?

17:53.880 --> 17:55.836
She does Alan.

17:58.480 --> 18:00.710
Okay, okay, that...
That is how it started...

18:00.880 --> 18:04.270
...but in the last day and a half
it has blossomed into so much more.

18:04.440 --> 18:08.638
Oh, my randy little nincompoop.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.791
Listen, if I had gotten married...

18:10.960 --> 18:14.873
...after every weekend of hot, sweaty
debauchery with a virtual stranger...

18:15.040 --> 18:19.989
...you'd have, well, many more
stepfathers than you already have.

18:20.160 --> 18:22.799
She knows what
she's talking about, Alan.

18:22.960 --> 18:26.999
Mom's been on more hotel pillows
than a chocolate mint.

18:32.760 --> 18:34.512
Don't help me, Charlie.

18:34.680 --> 18:38.753
Now... Now, listen, sweetheart.
Sweetheart, no offense...

18:38.920 --> 18:41.832
...but since you're dirt-poor
and living with your brother...

18:42.000 --> 18:46.278
...one must ask, what kind of woman
would agree to marry you?

18:46.440 --> 18:50.274
Unless she's a little slow,
or looking for a green card.

18:52.280 --> 18:54.271
Listen to your mommy, Alan.

18:54.440 --> 18:57.238
No. No, I am gonna listen to my heart.

18:57.400 --> 18:59.789
For your information,
she hasn't agreed to marry me.

18:59.960 --> 19:02.633
- I haven't even asked her yet.
- But you're planning to?

19:02.800 --> 19:05.837
- Yes.
- I'm not going to hit you, darling.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.399
Charlie.

19:10.640 --> 19:14.110
Okay, look, I will thank you both
to let me live my own life.

19:14.280 --> 19:15.838
I love Nancy, and Nancy loves me.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.639
And if this is a mistake,
then it will be my mistake.

19:19.080 --> 19:23.392
Hello? Nancy. You miss me?
I miss you.

19:23.560 --> 19:26.870
Listen, there's something I wanna
ask you, but I wanna do it in person.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.472
Oh, oh, okay, okay. I understand.

19:29.640 --> 19:32.518
Yeah, sure. Sure. Bye.

19:33.400 --> 19:35.436
Her husband came back a day early.

19:38.360 --> 19:39.759
Okay, my mistake.

19:49.520 --> 19:52.830
- You hungry?
- What do we got?

19:53.960 --> 19:56.030
What do you want?

19:57.640 --> 20:00.393
I don't know. What are my choices?

20:01.200 --> 20:04.590
You can cook something,
or go live on the street.

20:06.360 --> 20:08.191
I'm not hungry.

20:32.280 --> 20:34.271
