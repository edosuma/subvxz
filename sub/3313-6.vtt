WEBVTT

00:07.038 --> 00:08.208
PREVIOUSLY ON
"MELISSA AND JOEY"...

00:08.209 --> 00:09.479
JOE, THIS IS AUSTIN.

00:09.480 --> 00:10.780
MY BEST FRIEND GROWING UP.

00:10.781 --> 00:12.282
YEAH, I LIVED RIGHT
NEXT DOOR TO MEL.

00:12.283 --> 00:14.044
I'M SEEING A RELATIONSHIP
START TO, UH...

00:14.045 --> 00:16.015
HOW DO I PUT THIS?

00:16.016 --> 00:17.447
EXPLODE.

00:17.448 --> 00:18.718
Joe: SO HOW'D YOU GET IN
TOUCH WITH AUSTIN AGAIN

00:18.719 --> 00:19.750
- AFTER ALL THIS TIME?
- Mel: FACEBOOK.

00:21.292 --> 00:23.022
JOE THINKS WE MAY BE
MORE THAN FRIENDS.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.125
I THINK HE MAY BE RIGHT. AT
LEAST I HOPE HE MAY BE RIGHT.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.656
WAIT WAIT.

00:26.657 --> 00:28.328
IS THIS TOO WEIRD?

00:28.329 --> 00:30.660
I MEAN, UP UNTIL KINDERGARTEN,
WE TOOK BATHS TOGETHER.

00:30.661 --> 00:33.032
YOU KNOW, YOU WERE LIKE
THE BROTHER I NEVER HAD.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.335
ARE WE REALLY GONNA KISS?

00:35.336 --> 00:36.337
SURE!

00:38.709 --> 00:41.641
"MELISSA AND JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.313
OH, NO.

00:43.314 --> 00:44.644
IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN.

00:44.645 --> 00:45.645
AN HOUR AGO, MY FRIENDS

00:45.646 --> 00:47.347
INSTAGRAMMED FROM
THE BOWLING ALLEY.

00:47.348 --> 00:49.619
NOW THEY'RE INSTAGRAMMING
FROM WAFFLE PALACE.

00:49.620 --> 00:50.750
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?

00:50.751 --> 00:53.323
YOUR FRIENDS ARE
TIRED AND STICKY?

00:53.324 --> 00:55.425
NO. IT MEANS I DON'T EXIST.

00:55.426 --> 00:56.586
YOU GET SUSPENDED FROM SCHOOL

00:56.587 --> 00:57.627
AND EVERYONE FORGETS
YOU'RE ALIVE.

00:57.628 --> 00:59.360
OH, THEY FORGOT YOU
IN NINTH GRADE.

01:00.631 --> 01:02.332
BUT I CAN HELP.

01:02.333 --> 01:04.264
SEE, THERE'S A WHOLE CHAPTER
IN MY PSYCHOLOGY BOOK

01:04.265 --> 01:05.335
ON LONELY NERDS.

01:05.336 --> 01:06.666
THERE IS NOT.

01:06.667 --> 01:10.100
ALL RIGHT. WELL,
NERDS IS IN QUOTES.

01:10.101 --> 01:11.771
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE.

01:11.772 --> 01:14.744
"OUTCAST STATUS CAN LEAD
TO LEARNING DIFFICULTIES,

01:14.745 --> 01:17.607
DEPRESSION AND LACK
OF PERSONAL HYGIENE."

01:17.608 --> 01:19.549
( sniffs )

01:19.550 --> 01:21.512
DUDE, YOUR HEAD SMELLS LIKE
DOG THE BOUNTY HUNTER.

01:22.853 --> 01:25.615
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU
ACTUALLY WASHED YOUR HAIR?

01:25.616 --> 01:26.856
- UM...
- OKAY.

01:26.857 --> 01:28.518
ALL RIGHT, IF
YOU'RE SAYING "UM,"

01:28.519 --> 01:29.719
IT'S BEEN TOO LONG. ALL RIGHT?

01:29.720 --> 01:31.191
OOH, THE GAME'S ALMOST ON.
I GOTTA GO.

01:31.192 --> 01:32.322
I GOT MONEY ON THIS GAME.

01:32.323 --> 01:33.323
WELL, IT'S ONLY $2,

01:33.324 --> 01:35.626
BUT MY AUNT CARLOTA'S
GOING DOWN.

01:38.229 --> 01:39.700
AND LOOK AT THAT. THE
GAME IS ALREADY ON.

01:41.372 --> 01:42.872
AND AUSTIN IS ROUNDING SECOND.

01:42.873 --> 01:46.536
THIS IS NOT A SPECTATOR'S
SPORT, LONGO.

01:46.537 --> 01:47.807
HEY, JOE. WE IN YOUR WAY?

01:47.808 --> 01:50.340
NO, NOT AT ALL. UM...

01:50.341 --> 01:52.482
THAT'S COOL. I'LL BE A GREAT GUY

01:52.483 --> 01:54.544
AND JUST WATCH THIS
ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME MATCH

01:54.545 --> 01:58.748
UP ON THE YUGOSLAVIAN 12-INCH
TV WITH RABBIT EARS.

01:58.749 --> 02:00.750
UH, WELL, A REALLY GREAT
GUY WOULD BE GONE ALREADY.

02:00.751 --> 02:02.492
THAT'S WHERE I WAS HEADED.
I'M GOING, ALL RIGHT?

02:02.493 --> 02:03.793
LOOK, HAVE FUN. OKAY?

02:03.794 --> 02:05.355
AND JUST REMEMBER THAT ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS DOOR

02:05.356 --> 02:08.858
THERE ARE TWO, AS YET,
UNTRAUMATIZED TEENAGERS.

02:08.859 --> 02:11.232
BUT, UH, ENJOY.

02:13.434 --> 02:14.864
WOW, THAT SURE
RAINED OUT THE GAME.

02:14.865 --> 02:17.538
NO, RAIN MAKES THINGS GROW.

02:18.709 --> 02:21.140
I JUST THINK THAT
PERHAPS WE COULD FIND

02:21.141 --> 02:23.744
A MORE ADULT SETTING WITH
A SCOOCH MORE PRIVACY.

02:25.376 --> 02:26.716
HOW ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

02:26.717 --> 02:28.818
- THE BRIGHTON RESORT?
- MM-HMM.

02:28.819 --> 02:30.580
HMM, FANCY.

02:30.581 --> 02:31.651
I MADE US A RESERVATION.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.523
I THINK OUR FIRST NIGHT
TOGETHER SHOULD BE SPECIAL.

02:33.524 --> 02:34.854
ME TOO.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.926
HAVE I EVER TOLD YOU HOW
SPECIAL THIS COUCH IS?

02:36.927 --> 02:39.529
WE'VE WAITED LIKE 30 YEARS.

02:39.530 --> 02:40.860
WHAT'S A LITTLE
WHILE LONGER, HUH?

02:40.861 --> 02:42.662
TORTURE.

02:42.663 --> 02:46.236
BUT A GOOD, SWEET,
ROMANTIC KIND OF TORTURE.

02:46.237 --> 02:47.537
I WAS THINKING THIS WEEKEND.

02:47.538 --> 02:48.668
( sighs ) YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:48.669 --> 02:50.201
YOU'VE TALKED ME INTO IT.

02:51.402 --> 02:53.243
- NOW GET OUT.
- WHAT?

02:53.244 --> 02:55.345
WHY?

02:55.346 --> 02:56.546
WELL, YOU'RE TOO HOT.

02:56.547 --> 02:58.578
YOU CAN'T STAY HERE
LOOKING LIKE THIS.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.650
YOU'RE LIKE AN OPEN
BOX OF COOKIES.

03:00.651 --> 03:02.582
AWW, THAT'S SWEET...

03:02.583 --> 03:03.613
NO... GO! GO!

03:03.614 --> 03:04.954
TAKE YOUR CREAM FILLING
AND GET OUT OF HERE.

LELAND, THIS IS RYDER.

03:47.298 --> 03:48.959
HELLO.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.603
SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN.

03:53.764 --> 03:56.235
YOU RENTED ME A DWEEB?

03:56.236 --> 03:57.236
NO NO NO NO.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.538
LELAND ANOTHER
AT-HOME SCHOOL KID

03:58.539 --> 03:59.539
WHO LIVES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.641
I SWEAR YOU CAN FIND
ANYTHING ONLINE.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.513
ANYWAY, I MADE A
DEAL WITH HIS MOM.

04:03.514 --> 04:04.544
SO HE'S GONNA BE JOINING US

04:04.545 --> 04:06.277
FOR OUR GOVERNMENT
CLASS FROM NOW ON.

04:08.419 --> 04:10.480
WHAT'S YOUR MINECRAFT USERNAME?

04:10.481 --> 04:12.282
I DON'T PLAY MINECRAFT.

04:12.283 --> 04:14.253
I BUILT A VILLAGE IN THE FOREST

04:14.254 --> 04:16.956
AND TAMED THE OCELOTS
BEFORE THEY MOB SPAWNED.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.358
ACTUALLY, UH,

04:18.359 --> 04:19.790
I THINK MY USERNAME
IS "KILL ME NOW."

04:21.261 --> 04:22.733
THAT'S AN AWESOME HANDLE.

04:24.895 --> 04:27.598
LOOK AT YOU TWO GETTING ALONG.

04:30.601 --> 04:32.542
HOPE YOU DIDN'T MIND
DRIVING WITH THE TOP DOWN.

04:32.543 --> 04:33.873
OH, NOT AT ALL. NEXT
TIME LET'S DRIVE

04:33.874 --> 04:34.945
WITH MY TOP DOWN.

04:37.508 --> 04:40.410
OH! HEY, GUYS.

04:40.411 --> 04:41.911
HEY, LOOK, ARE YOU GOING TO BE
HEADING OVER TO THE COUCH AGAIN?

04:41.912 --> 04:43.012
'CAUSE IF YOU ARE, MEL,
I THINK WE SHOULD MAYBE

04:43.013 --> 04:45.355
INVEST IN SOME SLIPCOVERS.

04:45.356 --> 04:47.056
NO, JOE. HE'S JUST
DROPPING ME OFF.

04:47.057 --> 04:48.488
THE COUCH IS SAFE.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.620
SO MEL TELLS ME YOU'RE A
PRETTY GOOD POOL PLAYER.

04:50.621 --> 04:51.721
PRETTY GOOD?

04:51.722 --> 04:53.563
YEAH. I MEAN, IT'S
HOW I PUT MYSELF

04:53.564 --> 04:54.824
THROUGH BUSINESS SCHOOL
WITH MONEY LEFT OVER.

04:54.825 --> 04:57.598
BUT SURE, WE'LL GO
WITH "PRETTY GOOD."

04:58.399 --> 04:59.469
WELL, I JUST BROUGHT IT UP

04:59.470 --> 05:00.470
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
IT MIGHT BE NICE

05:00.471 --> 05:01.871
FOR THE TWO OF YOU TO HANG OUT.

05:01.872 --> 05:03.433
YOU KNOW, GET TO
KNOW EACH OTHER.

05:03.434 --> 05:05.375
JOE, YOU COULD MAKE AN EFFORT.

05:05.376 --> 05:08.077
I APPRECIATE YOU TRYING TO SET
ME UP ON A MAN DATE, MEL,

05:08.078 --> 05:11.310
BUT, UH, I'M ACTUALLY
VERY HAPPY BEING SINGLE.

05:11.311 --> 05:14.514
BESIDES, I'M NOT REALLY
INTO THE "THOR" TYPE.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.946
( cellphone ringing )

05:16.947 --> 05:18.488
OH, I GOT TO TAKE THIS.

05:18.489 --> 05:19.949
MINOR CRISIS DOWN AT CITY HALL

05:19.950 --> 05:22.091
THAT REQUIRES A CERTAIN
BLONDE CHARMER.

05:22.092 --> 05:23.793
( chuckles ) THAT'S ME.

05:23.794 --> 05:26.055
YOU KNOW, BUDDY, I
THINK YOU MIGHT

05:26.056 --> 05:28.057
LIKE PLAYING SOME
POOL DOWN AT MY CLUB.

05:28.058 --> 05:29.459
OH, YOU HAVE A CLUB?

05:29.460 --> 05:30.630
THE TOLEDO ATHLETIC CLUB.
I'M A MEMBER.

05:30.631 --> 05:33.062
YEAH, I USED TO BE A MEMBER.
BACK WHEN I HAD, UM...

05:33.063 --> 05:34.534
WHAT DO YOU CALL IT?

05:34.535 --> 05:35.705
MONEY.

05:35.706 --> 05:37.106
IT'S A GREAT CLUB.

05:37.107 --> 05:38.638
SOME MEMBERS ALREADY ASKED ME
TO RUN FOR VICE PRESIDENT.

05:38.639 --> 05:41.040
I WAS PRESIDENT.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.612
WHEN YOU HAD MONEY.

05:42.613 --> 05:44.474
EXACTLY. YEAH.

05:44.475 --> 05:47.977

OR A 9-BALL MAN?

05:56.787 --> 05:58.428
HONESTLY... ( sighing )

05:58.429 --> 06:00.461
YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY MORE
HOW YOU PREFER TO LOSE.

06:01.992 --> 06:04.434
OKAY, ONE CRISIS PUT TO BED.

06:04.435 --> 06:06.636
NOW, WHAT IS IT GONNA
TAKE TO CONVINCE YOU BOYS

06:06.637 --> 06:08.968
TO PLAY A NICE, FRIENDLY
GAME OF POOL TOGETHER?

06:08.969 --> 06:11.101

06:12.142 --> 06:14.544
LET'S MAKE IT 5:00.

06:14.545 --> 06:17.507
RYDER'S GOT A TEETH CLEANING.

06:17.508 --> 06:19.048
DONE.

06:19.049 --> 06:20.550
IT'S MY UNSTOPPABLE
BLONDE CHARM.

06:20.551 --> 06:21.981
WORKS EVERY TIME.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.553
OKAY.

06:23.554 --> 06:24.554
LET GO NOW.

06:24.555 --> 06:25.456
LET GO!

06:29.490 --> 06:31.060
OKAY, LELAND.

06:31.061 --> 06:32.992
LET'S REALLY TRY AND
CONCENTRATE ON THIS ONE.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.594
JOE SAYS IT'S GONNA
BE ON THE TEST.

06:34.595 --> 06:36.926
"COMPARE AND CONTRAST
THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION

06:36.927 --> 06:38.568
WITH ANOTHER WAR
OF INDEPENDENCE."

06:38.569 --> 06:39.699
JEE SHOK BAY.

06:39.700 --> 06:42.533
HEGHLU'MEH QAQ JAJVAM.

06:44.975 --> 06:46.005
DUDE, FOR THE LAST TIME,

06:46.006 --> 06:48.037
YOU CANNOT WRITE YOUR
ESSAY IN KLINGON.

06:48.038 --> 06:50.039
BEE LOOGH BAY! TU SHOOJ!

06:50.040 --> 06:51.511
OKAY, HOW DO YOU SAY
THIS IN KLINGON?

06:51.512 --> 06:52.612
IF YOU DON'T STOP THAT,

06:52.613 --> 06:54.083
I'M GONNA PUNCH YOUR
POINTY EARS OFF.

06:54.084 --> 06:57.817
ACTUALLY, POINTY
EARS ARE VULCANS.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.118
OKAY, THAT'S IT.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.189
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIVE
LONG ENOUGH TO PROSPER.

07:00.190 --> 07:01.190
HEY, RYDER.

07:01.191 --> 07:02.593
CAN I SEE YOU A SECOND?

07:04.194 --> 07:06.556
YOU REALIZE WHY THAT KID
IS BOTHERING YOU SO MUCH?

07:06.557 --> 07:08.197
SEE, ACCORDING TO CARL JUNG,

07:08.198 --> 07:10.159
LELAND IS YOUR SHADOW.

07:10.160 --> 07:12.201
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

07:12.202 --> 07:13.202
YOU CAN'T STAND NERDY LELAND

07:13.203 --> 07:14.564
BECAUSE YOU WERE ALWAYS NERDY.

07:14.565 --> 07:15.735
THIS IS TEXTBOOK STUFF.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.066
YOU DON'T LIKE THE GEEK IN HIM

07:17.067 --> 07:20.470
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
LIKE THE GEEK IN YOU.

07:20.471 --> 07:21.741
NO, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.212
IF YOU THINK I'M ANYTHING
AT ALL LIKE HIM,

07:23.213 --> 07:25.145
YOU HAVE MUCH TO
LEARN, YOUNG PADAWAN.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.818
OH, NO.

07:28.819 --> 07:30.220
YOU'VE JUST BEEN SHRUNK, SON.

07:35.526 --> 07:38.157
ONE GAME FOR ME AND ONE FOR YOU.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.458
NICELY PLAYED.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.491
YEAH, WELL, I FIGURED
I WOULD SPOT YOU ONE.

07:41.492 --> 07:43.462
YOU KNOW, KIND OF KEEP
THINGS INTERESTING.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.864
YOU'RE TRYING TO PSYCHE ME OUT.

07:44.865 --> 07:47.466
PERSONALLY, I DON'T DO
THAT KIND OF THING.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.898
SO TELL ME, JOE.

07:48.899 --> 07:50.540
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO
BACK IN THE CLUB

07:50.541 --> 07:52.702
YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO
PLAY IN ANYMORE?

07:52.703 --> 07:54.845
YOU WANT TO KEEP TALKING OR JUST
GET STRAIGHT TO YOU LOSING?

07:56.807 --> 07:59.709
Mel: HEY, EVERYBODY!
LADY LUCK HAS ARRIVED.

07:59.710 --> 08:01.010
THANK YOU, BURKE.

08:01.011 --> 08:02.481
IT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE
BROKEN IN LIKE FOREVER

08:02.482 --> 08:04.213
AND NOT GOTTEN A SINGLE
BALL IN ANY OF THE POCKETS.

08:04.214 --> 08:06.516
YEAH, BUT YOU SET ME UP GREAT.

08:06.517 --> 08:07.887
SO MANY CHOICES.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.619
SO IS EVERYONE PLAYING NICELY?

08:09.620 --> 08:10.620
OH, IS THAT WHY YOU CAME HERE

08:10.621 --> 08:12.161
TO BE PLAYGROUND MONITOR?

08:12.162 --> 08:13.663
WELL, I KNOW THAT WHEN
BOYS PLAY UNSUPERVISED,

08:13.664 --> 08:15.265
THEY TEND TO, YOU KNOW,
KILL EACH OTHER.

08:17.167 --> 08:18.497
NICE!

08:18.498 --> 08:19.529
NICE?

08:19.530 --> 08:20.530
I PRACTICALLY PUT THAT BALL

08:20.531 --> 08:21.671
IN FRONT OF THE POCKET FOR HIM.

08:21.672 --> 08:23.203
YEAH, THANKS FOR THAT, JOE.

08:24.835 --> 08:27.036
AND THAT'S ONE I
SET UP FOR MYSELF.

08:27.037 --> 08:28.878
HE'S GOOD.

08:28.879 --> 08:30.140
WHEN IS IT YOUR TURN AGAIN?

08:34.214 --> 08:36.786
WHEW. WINNING IS EXHAUSTING.

08:36.787 --> 08:39.249
I THINK I NEED MYSELF
A LITTLE KISS BREAK.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.593
NOW BLOW ON THE CUE FOR LUCK.

08:43.594 --> 08:45.154
AND THAT'S JUST A PREVIEW
OF WHAT'S TO COME

08:45.155 --> 08:46.196
AT THE HOTEL TONIGHT.

08:48.098 --> 08:51.000
PUKE IN THE CORNER POCKET.

08:51.001 --> 08:52.603
WHAT? THE HOTEL
HAS A POOL TABLE.

08:54.835 --> 08:57.006
AWW. I'M SORRY I
COULDN'T BE BETTER LUCK.

08:57.007 --> 08:58.107
THAT'S OKAY.

08:58.108 --> 09:00.140
I THINK I CAN FIND SOMEWAY
TO CONSOLE MYSELF.

09:02.973 --> 09:04.043
YOU GUYS...

09:04.044 --> 09:06.046
THIS IS WHY I DON'T
COME HERE ANYMORE.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.579
CAN WE... OKAY.

09:09.580 --> 09:10.621
I NEED YOU...

09:12.252 --> 09:13.552
HEY, CAN YOU GUYS
MOVE IT PLEASE?

09:13.553 --> 09:14.584
'CAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT
IN MY LINE OF SIGHT.

09:14.585 --> 09:15.925
- OH, SORRY.
- OH.

09:15.926 --> 09:18.057
THANK YOU. OFF THE
TABLE, ALL RIGHT?

09:18.058 --> 09:19.258
THANKS SO MUCH.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.631
THANKS SO MUCH. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.993
( squeals and giggles )

09:23.994 --> 09:25.195
- ( cue stick thuds )
- OH!

09:26.266 --> 09:29.168
DID I JUST HIT HIM WHERE
I THINK I HIT HIM?

09:29.169 --> 09:30.339
( high-pitched whimper )

09:30.340 --> 09:33.002
- ( high-pitched groan )
- THAT WOULD BE A YES.

09:33.003 --> 09:34.874
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT, BUDDY?

09:34.875 --> 09:37.077
WHY DON'T WE JUST
CALL THIS A DRAW?

09:44.354 --> 09:46.616
HEY. ALL RIGHT, SO...

09:46.617 --> 09:48.688
WHAT DID THE DOCTOR SAY?

09:48.689 --> 09:49.860
YOU BROKE MY BOYFRIEND, JOE.

09:51.361 --> 09:55.124
YOU RUPTURED MAJOR VESSELS
IN HIS MALE FUN ZONE.

09:55.125 --> 09:57.126
YEAH, THE DOCTOR SAID
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING

09:57.127 --> 09:59.598
THAT MIGHT CREATE BLOOD FLOW
TO THAT PART OF THE BODY.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.101
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO STOP THAT, HUH?

10:02.102 --> 10:04.874
HUH, WEAR AN INVISIBILITY CLOAK?

10:04.875 --> 10:06.105
I'M SORRY.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.077
NO, YOU'RE NOT UNDERSTANDING.

10:07.078 --> 10:08.908
WE CAN'T HAVE SEX FOR A WEEK.

10:08.909 --> 10:11.981
OKAY AND TONIGHT'S HOTEL
RESERVATION IS NONREFUNDABLE.

10:11.982 --> 10:13.913
I WAS SUPPOSED TO
BE NAKED RIGHT NOW.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.284
I SAID I'M SORRY.

10:15.285 --> 10:16.916
IT'S NOT LIKE I DID
IT ON PURPOSE.

10:16.917 --> 10:17.948
OH, OF COURSE NOT.

10:19.049 --> 10:21.050
OH, COME ON. LOOK,
I LIKE AUSTIN.

10:21.051 --> 10:23.022
YOU KNOW, THE GUY JUST
DOESN'T KNOW WHERE TO STAND

10:23.023 --> 10:24.924
WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING POOL.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.325
OH, YOU'RE BLAMING HIM?

10:26.326 --> 10:27.827
SO I SUPPOSE HIS GROIN

10:27.828 --> 10:29.128
CHARGED FULL SPEED
INTO YOUR POOL CUE.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.061
WH... ( grunts )

10:32.062 --> 10:33.733
THAT WAS NO ACCIDENT, JOE.

10:33.734 --> 10:34.964
ARE YOU KIDDING? THAT'S
THE VERY DEFINITION

10:34.965 --> 10:36.105
OF AN ACCIDENT.

10:36.106 --> 10:37.136
YOU EVER SEE "AMERICA'S
FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS"?

10:37.137 --> 10:39.038
THAT WOULD WIN LIKE EVERY WEEK.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.040
WHY WOULD I DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT ON PURPOSE?

10:41.041 --> 10:42.842
WHO KNOWS?

10:42.843 --> 10:44.944
GO SEE A THERAPIST AND
FIND OUT WHAT'S DRIVING

10:44.945 --> 10:47.016
THAT MUSCLE-BOUND
BRAIN OF YOURS.

10:47.017 --> 10:47.978
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

10:47.979 --> 10:49.148
I DON'T HAVE ANY MUSCLES
IN MY BRAIN, BABY.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.179
BUT IF I DID,

10:50.180 --> 10:52.953
IT WOULD BE INSANELY
WELL-DEFINED.

10:57.788 --> 10:59.158
SO THE AMERICAN GENERALS

10:59.159 --> 11:00.990
IN THEIR FIGHT AGAINST
KING GEORGE III

11:00.991 --> 11:02.732
WERE REALLY VERY SIMILAR TO?

11:02.733 --> 11:05.434
THE JEDI COMMANDERS WHO
HELPED THE REBEL FORCES

11:05.435 --> 11:06.836
IN THEIR FIGHT
AGAINST THE EMPIRE?

11:06.837 --> 11:08.037
AFFIRMATIVE.

11:08.038 --> 11:09.398
I MEAN, YEAH.

11:09.399 --> 11:11.000
I THINK WE'RE ONTO
SOMETHING HERE.

11:11.001 --> 11:13.202
THANKS, RYDER.

11:13.203 --> 11:15.274
( camera shutter clicks )

11:15.275 --> 11:16.275
WHAT YOU DOING?

11:16.276 --> 11:18.407
I'M JUST UPDATING MY INSTAGRAM.

11:18.408 --> 11:19.678
HEY, THAT'S A PHOTO OF ME.

11:19.679 --> 11:20.710
WHY'D YOU POST THAT?

11:20.711 --> 11:21.981
TO LET THE WORLD KNOW

11:21.982 --> 11:22.982
HOW ME AND MY BEST BUD

11:22.983 --> 11:25.415
HAVE BEEN TOTALLY PARTYING DOWN.

11:27.417 --> 11:29.188
IT'S LIKE A MILLION
PHOTOS OF US.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.920
JUST 87...

11:30.921 --> 11:33.392
A ROMULAN'S DOZEN.

11:33.393 --> 11:34.824
WELL, DELETE THEM.

11:34.825 --> 11:35.825
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

11:35.826 --> 11:36.896
PEOPLE COULD SEE THESE.

11:36.897 --> 11:39.368
WELL, THAT'S KIND OF THE
POINT OF INSTAGRAM.

11:39.369 --> 11:40.870
DUDE, DOING HOMEWORK

11:40.871 --> 11:42.231
ON OPPOSITE ENDS OF
A DINING ROOM TABLE

11:42.232 --> 11:44.874
IS NOT PARTYING AND WE ARE
NOT DEFINITELY NOT FRIENDS!

11:44.875 --> 11:47.036
OH.

11:47.037 --> 11:49.039
I SEE.

11:50.911 --> 11:53.843
WAIT, LELAND, I
JUST MEANT THAT...

11:53.844 --> 11:55.114
I GOT YOUR MEANING

11:55.115 --> 11:56.916
LOUD AND CLEAR.

11:56.917 --> 11:57.888
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

11:57.889 --> 12:00.219
I'M GOING TO HANG OUT
WITH MY REAL FRIENDS...

12:00.220 --> 12:01.852
IN THE POKEMON CHAT ROOM.

12:07.327 --> 12:08.999
- ( door closes )
- HE'S GONE.

12:11.762 --> 12:12.933
YES!

12:17.337 --> 12:18.838
HEY, JOE.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.039
YOU GOT ANY PLANS FOR CHRISTMAS?

12:20.040 --> 12:22.511
NO. NO I'M NOT GONNA
BE DOING ANYTHING.

12:22.512 --> 12:23.873
REALLY? OH.

12:23.874 --> 12:27.016
I HEARD YOU'RE STARRING
IN "THE NUTCRACKER."

12:27.017 --> 12:28.317
FUNNY.

12:28.318 --> 12:30.249
BUT DESPITE WHAT YOUR AUNT
SAYS, IT WAS A TOTAL ACCIDENT.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.951
OKAY? ALTHOUGH SHE
THINKS I HAD SOME DEEP,

12:31.952 --> 12:33.282
SUBCONSCIOUS MOTIVATION

12:33.283 --> 12:35.254
AND THAT I OUGHT TO
GET MY HEAD EXAMINED.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.285
HMM.

12:36.286 --> 12:38.888
AND HOW DID THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?

12:38.889 --> 12:39.959
SHE'S WAY OFF BASE.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.230
I MEAN, I HAD NO HIDDEN AGENDA.

12:41.231 --> 12:44.033
SO YOU'RE NOT BOTHERED BY HER
RELATIONSHIP WITH AUSTIN?

12:44.034 --> 12:45.064
NO, NOT AT ALL.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.165
YOU KNOW WHAT I ALWAYS SAY...

12:46.166 --> 12:48.397
"YOU GOTTA LIVE AND LET LIVE."

12:48.398 --> 12:50.199
YEAH, I'VE NEVER
HEARD YOU SAY THAT.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.471
I SAY IT LATE AT NIGHT
AFTER YOU'RE ASLEEP, OKAY?

12:52.472 --> 12:53.772
LOOK, IT'S JUST THAT

12:53.773 --> 12:55.004
I'VE SEEN THESE FACEBOOK

12:55.005 --> 12:56.405
CHILDHOOD HOOKUPS BEFORE, OKAY?

12:56.406 --> 12:57.776
AND THEY NEVER END WELL.

12:57.777 --> 12:58.878
I JUST WISH YOUR AUNT
WOULD LOOK AHEAD OF HER

12:58.879 --> 13:00.049
TO FIND A GUY INSTEAD
OF BEHIND HER.

13:00.050 --> 13:01.050
FROM WHAT I HEARD,
YOU'RE THE ONE

13:01.051 --> 13:03.782
WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN
LOOKING BEHIND.

13:03.783 --> 13:04.884
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.185
TELL YOU WHAT, JOE.

13:06.186 --> 13:07.887
AS AN EXPERIMENT, LET'S PRETEND

13:07.888 --> 13:09.919
THAT HITTING AUSTIN
WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.

13:09.920 --> 13:11.090
WHY DO YOU THINK YOU HIT HIM?

13:11.091 --> 13:13.092
I WAS DISTRACTED.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.024
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, SHE
WALKS INTO THE POOL HALL

13:15.025 --> 13:17.326
AND IMMEDIATELY STARTS PLAYING
KISSY FACE WITH AUSTIN.

13:17.327 --> 13:19.829
I HAD A SHOT PERFECTLY LINED UP.
I WAS ABOUT READY TO TAKE IT.

13:19.830 --> 13:21.170
YOU KNOW, AND THEN I HEAR...

13:21.171 --> 13:24.133
( mocking Mel ) OOH,
YOU'RE SO FINE. UH!

13:24.134 --> 13:26.805
SO YOUR WHOLE ATTITUDE
CHANGED WHEN MEL SHOWED UP.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.307
HER BUTT WAS ON THE TABLE.

13:28.308 --> 13:31.410
SO YOU GOT DISTRACTED BY
THE PRESENCE OF HER BUTT.

13:31.411 --> 13:34.513
WHAT ARE THEY TEACHING
YOU IN THAT SCHOOL, HUH?

13:34.514 --> 13:36.085
THE SIGHT OF BUTTOCKS
INCITED STRONG...

13:36.086 --> 13:37.286
HEY HEY HEY. NO NO,
DON'T DON'T...

13:37.287 --> 13:38.948
DON'T WRITE ANYTHING DOWN.

13:38.949 --> 13:40.319
JOE, I'M MERELY SUGGESTING

13:40.320 --> 13:42.591
THAT WHATEVER YOUR
FEELINGS FOR AUNT MEL ARE,

13:42.592 --> 13:45.925
THEY MAY BE STRONGER THAN
YOU'RE WILLING TO ADMIT.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.026
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

13:47.027 --> 13:48.057
I THINK YOU'RE VERY LUCKY

13:48.058 --> 13:49.458
YOU'RE NOT IN MY HOME SCHOOL,

13:49.459 --> 13:51.830
BECAUSE YOU WOULD BE FLUNKING
PSYCHOLOGY RIGHT NOW.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.933
I CAN SEE YOU THIS TIME
AGAIN ON THURSDAY.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.435
EWW EWW! NO. I'M NOT... NO.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.914
NOW FOR A PERFECT CRUST,

14:04.915 --> 14:06.615
YOU WANT TO MAKE IT NOT
TOO THIN, BUT EVEN.

14:06.616 --> 14:08.218
SO YOU NEED A SMOOTH,
STEADY ROLL.

14:10.450 --> 14:11.421
HERE YOU GO.

14:11.422 --> 14:13.283
A LITTLE FLOUR.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.256
OKAY, I DON'T THINK
I'M DOING THIS RIGHT.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.628
HERE, LET ME HELP.

14:19.629 --> 14:21.160
LIKE THIS. LIKE THIS.

14:21.161 --> 14:24.063
BACK AND FORTH. BACK AND FORTH.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.094
SEE, DOESN'T THAT FEEL NICE?

14:25.095 --> 14:26.365
YEAH, OKAY.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.937
I THINK I'M GETTING
THE RHYTHM NOW.

14:27.938 --> 14:31.200
UH, IT'S GOING BACK
AND FORTH SO EASILY.

14:31.201 --> 14:33.042
IT IS.

14:33.043 --> 14:34.103
IT'S NICE.

14:34.104 --> 14:36.005
OH, YEAH.

14:36.006 --> 14:37.506
WAIT. AUSTIN, HOLD ON.

14:37.507 --> 14:39.008
I THOUGHT THE POINT
OF THIS BAKING

14:39.009 --> 14:41.150
WAS TO KEEP OUR MINDS OFF
THE SEX WE CAN'T BE HAVING.

14:41.151 --> 14:42.651
YEAH, THAT WAS THE
ORIGINAL IDEA.

14:42.652 --> 14:44.383
OKAY. WELL, IT'S NOT
WORKING AT ALL.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.415
ALL I'M THINKING ABOUT IS WHAT
WE COULD DO WITH THAT BUTTER.

14:46.416 --> 14:48.157
- OH!
- OKAY.

14:48.158 --> 14:49.358
YOU NEED TO STAND OVER THERE.

14:49.359 --> 14:51.420
WAY OUT OF GRABBING RANGE.

14:51.421 --> 14:53.192
THIS IS ABOUT BAKING,
NOTHING ELSE.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.193
GOT IT, RIGHT.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.525
WELL, THE DOUGH LOOKS PERFECT.

14:56.526 --> 14:57.597
I THINK WE'RE READY
TO PUT IT IN.

14:58.969 --> 15:00.100
THE PIE TIN.

15:05.075 --> 15:06.235
- JUST PINCH THE EDGES.
- OKAY.

15:06.236 --> 15:08.307
Austin: LIKE SO.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.309
BEAUTIFUL.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.141
I WAS THINKING THE SAME THING.

15:12.142 --> 15:13.582
OKAY, DON'T GIVE ME THAT
"I'M GONNA KISS YOU" LOOK.

15:13.583 --> 15:15.644
DOCTOR SAID NONE OF THAT
FOR AT LEAST A WEEK.

15:15.645 --> 15:16.685
IT'S TOUGH.

15:16.686 --> 15:17.948
I ALWAYS HAVE THAT
LOOK AROUND YOU.

15:21.691 --> 15:23.022
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.

15:23.023 --> 15:25.324
EVEN THOUGH I'VE KNOWN
YOU MY WHOLE LIFE,

15:25.325 --> 15:27.557
EVERY DAY THERE'S LIKE
A NEW FIRST WITH YOU.

15:32.362 --> 15:33.702
OH, WHAT ABOUT DOCTOR'S ORDERS?

15:33.703 --> 15:35.234
OH, LET HIM FILL HIS OWN PIE.

15:35.235 --> 15:36.435
WAS THAT DIRTY?

15:36.436 --> 15:38.038
RIGHT NOW, EVERYTHING IS.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.642
( banging on door )

15:45.415 --> 15:47.476
( banging continues )

15:47.477 --> 15:48.478
DON'T GET UP.

15:50.480 --> 15:51.580
ARE YOU RYDER SCANLON?

15:51.581 --> 15:52.581
YES.

15:52.582 --> 15:54.283
I'M KEIRA GUCKENHEIM-SCHAPP.

15:54.284 --> 15:55.324
NICE TO MEET YOU.

15:55.325 --> 15:56.325
LELAND'S SISTER.

15:56.326 --> 15:57.487
MM.

15:58.628 --> 15:59.958
MY BROTHER TOLD ME
WHAT YOU SAID TO HIM.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.260
- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW...
- YOU TOLD HIM

16:01.261 --> 16:02.661
YOU'D NEVER BE FRIENDS
WITH SOMEONE LIKE HIM.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.333
MUST HAVE MADE YOU
FEEL REAL BIG, HUH?

16:04.334 --> 16:05.394
NOT EVERYBODY

16:05.395 --> 16:07.736
CAN BE AS POPULAR AS
YOU, RYDER SCANLON.

16:07.737 --> 16:08.998
I'M POPULAR?

16:08.999 --> 16:10.399
OH, SURE.

16:10.400 --> 16:11.400
ANNOUNCE IT TO THE WORLD.

16:11.401 --> 16:12.471
YEAH, SORRY. WHAT I MEAN IS...

16:12.472 --> 16:14.243
THINK HOW THE OTHER
GUY FEELS FOR ONCE.

16:14.244 --> 16:15.574
FROM NOW ON, I EXPECT YOU

16:15.575 --> 16:17.377
TO TREAT MY LITTLE BROTHER
WITH SOME RESPECT.

16:19.449 --> 16:21.150
WAIT, HOLD ON.

16:21.151 --> 16:22.251
LOOK,

16:22.252 --> 16:24.453
MAYBE I WAS A LITTLE
HARSH ON YOUR BROTHER,

16:24.454 --> 16:26.755
BUT I'VE BEEN UNDER A
LOT OF STRAIN RECENTLY.

16:26.756 --> 16:28.357
MAYBE I'M FORGETTING HOW
TO INTERACT WITH PEOPLE.

16:28.358 --> 16:29.588
I DON'T KNOW.

16:29.589 --> 16:30.759
I'VE BEEN HOMESCHOOLED
FOR AN ENTIRE MONTH.

16:30.760 --> 16:32.161
THAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?

16:32.162 --> 16:34.293
I'VE BEEN HOMESCHOOLED
MY WHOLE LIFE.

16:34.294 --> 16:35.994
WHAT ARE YOU EATING?!

16:35.995 --> 16:37.596
A PROCESSED BAKED GOOD?

16:37.597 --> 16:39.468
MY MOM HASN'T LET ME
HAVE REFINED SUGAR

16:39.469 --> 16:41.530
SINCE MY LITTLE BROTHER'S
EIGHTH BIRTHDAY.

16:41.531 --> 16:43.432
NOT TO MENTION, THE
WOUND HE GAVE THE CLOWN

16:43.433 --> 16:46.035
WAS TOTALLY SUPERFICIAL.

16:46.036 --> 16:47.206
YEAH. WELL, MY MOM LETS ME EAT

16:47.207 --> 16:49.238
PROCESSED BAKED GOODS
'CAUSE SHE'S IN PRISON.

16:49.239 --> 16:51.510
- I'M SORRY! I DIDN'T KNOW THAT!
- WELL, NOW YOU DO!

16:51.511 --> 16:53.482
STILL NO EXCUSE! YOU
SHOULD ACT NICER!

16:53.483 --> 16:55.184
- YOU CAN'T TELL ME HOW TO ACT!
- FINE! KEEP BEING A JERK!

16:55.185 --> 16:56.245
- I WILL!
- JERK!

16:56.246 --> 16:57.616
- YOU LIKE BOWLING?!
- LOVE BOWLING!

16:57.617 --> 16:59.288
- YOU WANT TO GO SOMETIME?!
- THAT SOUNDS DELIGHTFUL!

16:59.289 --> 17:00.489
OKAY, I'LL GET YOUR
NUMBER FROM LELAND!

17:00.490 --> 17:01.491
CAN'T WAIT!

17:03.793 --> 17:05.154
WOW.

17:05.155 --> 17:07.597
THE RARELY-SEEN MATING
RITUAL OF NERDS.

17:10.730 --> 17:13.662
WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED IN HERE?

17:13.663 --> 17:15.033
I BAKED A PIE.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.505
AH, HANDS OFF, LONGO!

17:16.506 --> 17:18.667
KEEP YOUR FINGERS OUT OF MY PIE.

17:18.668 --> 17:20.240
OH, I SEE BAKING RELAXES YOU.

17:22.142 --> 17:24.143
SO HOW'S AUSTIN'S, UH...

17:24.144 --> 17:26.175
YOU KNOW THE... THE...

17:26.176 --> 17:28.547
( whistles ) FUN ZONE?

17:28.548 --> 17:31.250
YEAH, STILL CLOSED FOR REPAIRS.

17:31.251 --> 17:32.681
AND HE HAD TO GO HOME
AND TAKE AN ICE BATH

17:32.682 --> 17:34.723
AFTER I INADVERTENTLY
AROUSED HIM.

17:34.724 --> 17:36.755
YOU KNOW, YOU JUST
CAN'T TURN THIS OFF.

17:36.756 --> 17:39.088
SO LOOK, I'VE BEEN THINKING
A LOT ABOUT THAT, ACTUALLY.

17:39.089 --> 17:41.130
YOU MAY NOT HAVE BEEN
COMPLETELY WRONG

17:41.131 --> 17:43.392
ABOUT THE WHOLE SUBCONSCIOUS
MOTIVATION THING,

17:43.393 --> 17:44.693
YOU KNOW, WITH THE
INCIDENT THAT...

17:44.694 --> 17:47.166
YOU KNOW, WITH THE...
OCCURRING...

17:47.167 --> 17:49.138
WOW, YOU CAN'T EVEN SAY IT.

17:49.139 --> 17:50.739
WHEN I WHACKED HIM IN
THE CHICKEN TENDERS.

17:50.740 --> 17:51.840
YOU HAPPY?

17:51.841 --> 17:54.273
SO YOU DID DO IT ON PURPOSE.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.145
NO NO. I DIDN'T DO IT
ON PURPOSE, ALL RIGHT?

17:56.146 --> 17:58.347
BUT IT GOT ME THINKING

17:58.348 --> 18:01.480
AND STIRRED UP SOME FEELINGS.

18:01.481 --> 18:02.611
ABOUT?

18:02.612 --> 18:04.453
ABOUT...

18:04.454 --> 18:08.288
YOU AND AUSTIN AND ME.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.223
I'M JEALOUS.

18:14.864 --> 18:16.094
JEALOUS?

18:16.095 --> 18:19.298
I'M JEALOUS, BECAUSE...

18:19.299 --> 18:20.769
IN WHAT UNIVERSE

18:20.770 --> 18:22.571
DO YOU GET TO HAVE A HEALTHY
RELATIONSHIP BEFORE ME?

18:22.572 --> 18:24.203
THAT JUST DOESN'T MAKE
ANY COSMIC SENSE.

18:24.204 --> 18:27.876
OH, YOU'RE JEALOUS ABOUT
THE RELATIONSHIP,

18:27.877 --> 18:30.539
NOT AUSTIN? LIKE YOU SAID.

18:30.540 --> 18:32.141
YEAH, EXACTLY.

18:32.142 --> 18:33.412
OH, AND UM,

18:33.413 --> 18:35.114
I GOT YOU A LITTLE SOMETHING.

18:35.885 --> 18:37.586
IT'S A ROMANTIC WEEKEND
GETAWAY FOR TWO

18:37.587 --> 18:40.389
AT THE MILLARD HOTEL, ALL RIGHT?
FOR YOU AND AUSTIN.

18:40.390 --> 18:42.821
AND THE DATES ARE FLEXIBLE
SO YOU GUYS CAN GO WHENEVER,

18:42.822 --> 18:45.625
YOU KNOW, HE GET'S OFF
THE GROUNDED-GROIN LIST.

18:47.557 --> 18:49.329
SO, ENJOY.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.235
JOE, I'M STUNNED.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.407
THIS IS SO MATURE AND GENEROUS.

18:58.408 --> 19:00.209
SO UNLIKE YOU.

19:00.210 --> 19:02.341
WELL, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE
GROW AND CHANGE.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.612
AND AS A MATTER OF FACT,

19:03.613 --> 19:05.244
I FOLLOWED YOUR
LEAD ON THIS ONE.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.475
I ENDED UP FACEBOOKING THIS GIRL

19:06.476 --> 19:08.217
THAT I WENT TO
JUNIOR HIGH WITH...

19:08.218 --> 19:09.348
VERY CUTE GIRL ACTUALLY...

19:09.349 --> 19:10.479
AND ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER,

19:10.480 --> 19:11.850
AND TONIGHT, I HAVE A DATE.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.282
SHE FLEW IN FROM JERSEY?

19:13.283 --> 19:15.154
NO, THE JUNIOR HIGH GIRL
WAS A FRIGGIN' MESS.

19:16.256 --> 19:17.526
BUT AFTER I GOT DONE
SKYPING WITH HER,

19:17.527 --> 19:18.627
I ENDED UP HOOKING
UP WITH THIS BARISTA

19:18.628 --> 19:20.389
AT THE COFFEE SHOP WHERE I WAS.

19:20.390 --> 19:22.431
SHE'S AN ASPIRING
LINGERIE MODEL.

19:22.432 --> 19:23.862
HER NAME IS CHARDONNAY.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.235
YOU WANT TO SEE HER?

19:26.866 --> 19:28.937
SHE'S ONLY WORKING THERE
PART-TIME UNTIL SHE BREAKS OUT.

19:28.938 --> 19:31.770
LOOKS LIKE SHE'S BREAKING
OUT OF THAT TOP RIGHT NOW.

19:31.771 --> 19:33.171
YEAH, IT DOES. DOESN'T IT?

19:33.172 --> 19:34.903
ANYWAY,

19:34.904 --> 19:36.174
WHEN SHE'S DONE WITH
WORK, WE'RE GONNA GO OUT

19:36.175 --> 19:37.946
AND TAKE IN A MIDNIGHT
SHOWING OF...

19:37.947 --> 19:39.479
WELL, HER. ( laughs )

19:40.950 --> 19:42.251
SO I GOT TO THANK YOU, BURKE

19:42.252 --> 19:43.452
BECAUSE I NEVER WOULD
HAVE PUT MYSELF OUT THERE

19:43.453 --> 19:46.184
IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU.
SO HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.916
I WILL SEE YOU...

19:47.917 --> 19:49.518
TOMORROW.

19:49.519 --> 19:51.960
I DON'T NEED SEX. I'VE GOT PIE.

19:51.961 --> 19:53.892
PIE BEATS SEX...

19:53.893 --> 19:55.895
NEVER!

20:02.402 --> 20:03.502
GOT EVERYTHING YOU
NEED FOR BOWLING?

20:03.503 --> 20:05.334
YEAH, BROUGHT SOCKS FOR TWO.

20:05.335 --> 20:07.506
THOSE RENTAL SHOES
ARE DISGUSTING.

20:07.507 --> 20:08.637
OH, AND SNACKS.

20:08.638 --> 20:11.780
WHAT ARE YOU ALLOWED? GRANOLA?
DRIED STRING BEANS?

20:11.781 --> 20:15.544
I WAS THINKING SOME OF THOSE
PROCESSED BAKED GOODS OF YOURS.

20:15.545 --> 20:16.945
THAT CAN BE ARRANGED.

20:16.946 --> 20:20.249
SO, KEIRA,

20:20.250 --> 20:21.921
HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN
ATTRACTED TO NERDS?

20:23.553 --> 20:24.793
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

20:24.794 --> 20:26.255
I'M JUST WONDERING
IF YOUR ATTRACTION

20:26.256 --> 20:27.526
TO GEEKY BOYS IS A PREFERENCE

20:27.527 --> 20:29.858
OR IS IT DUE TO SOME
GENETIC PREDISPOSITION.

20:29.859 --> 20:31.730
BRUNO BETTELHEIM WOULD SAY

20:31.731 --> 20:33.702
THAT YOUR INTEREST IN YOUR
BROTHER'S ROMANTIC LIFE

20:33.703 --> 20:36.535
SEEMS OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARIES OF
A HEALTHY SIBLING RELATIONSHIP.

20:36.536 --> 20:38.567
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?

20:38.568 --> 20:42.240
YEAH, WELL, FREUD WOULD SAY...

20:42.241 --> 20:43.443
"I KNOW YOU ARE, BUT WHAT AM I?"

20:46.376 --> 20:48.548
YOU TOTALLY HOMESCHOOLED HER.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.651
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO BOWLING.
