WEBVTT

01:39.391 --> 01:40.600
Twenty seconds to VTR.

01:40.684 --> 01:42.268
Stand by, 13-27.

01:42.352 --> 01:43.895
Joey, ready on graphics.

01:43.979 --> 01:46.355
Let's check the stack on file 102.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.107
Fifteen seconds to VTR.

01:48.192 --> 01:50.067
Stand by, roll-in, stand by, SOT 1.

01:50.152 --> 01:51.819
- Standing.
- 10 seconds.

01:51.904 --> 01:53.696
Ready, roll-in, ready, SOT 1.

01:53.947 --> 01:57.366
- Ready.
- In four, three, two, one.

01:57.659 --> 02:00.203
Roll-in.

02:11.340 --> 02:14.425
I welcome these hearings
because of the opportunity

02:14.510 --> 02:16.636
that they provide to the American people

02:17.346 --> 02:20.598
to better understand
why the tragedy of 9/11 happened

02:21.183 --> 02:24.811
and what we must do
to prevent a reoccurrence.

02:24.895 --> 02:28.481
I also welcome the hearings
because it is finally a forum

02:29.274 --> 02:31.818
where I can apologize

02:31.902 --> 02:35.613
to the loved ones of the victims of 9/11.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.574
To them who are here in the room,

02:38.659 --> 02:40.743
to those who are watching on television,

02:41.829 --> 02:44.580
your government failed you.

02:45.249 --> 02:48.125
Those entrusted with protecting you

02:48.210 --> 02:50.169
failed you.

02:50.254 --> 02:51.921
And I failed you.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.507
Good evening. I'm Will McAvoy.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.217
This is News Night, and that was a clip

02:56.301 --> 02:58.845
of Richard Clarke,
former counterterrorism chief

02:58.929 --> 03:00.388
to President George W. Bush,

03:00.472 --> 03:04.392
testifying before Congress on March 24, 2004.

03:04.810 --> 03:06.769
Americans liked that moment.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.604
I liked that moment.

03:08.689 --> 03:12.233
Adults should hold themselves
accountable for failure.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.360
And so tonight I'm beginning this newscast

03:14.444 --> 03:16.445
by joining Mr. Clarke in apologizing

03:16.530 --> 03:19.115
to the American people for our failure.

03:19.199 --> 03:23.035
The failure of this program during the time
I've been in charge of it

03:23.120 --> 03:26.455
to successfully inform and
educate the American electorate.

03:27.332 --> 03:29.542
Let me be clear that I don't apologize

03:29.626 --> 03:31.836
on behalf of all broadcast journalists,

03:31.962 --> 03:35.131
nor do all broadcast journalists
owe an apology.

03:35.257 --> 03:36.883
I speak for myself.

03:36.967 --> 03:40.595
I was an accomplice to a slow
and repeated and unacknowledged

03:40.679 --> 03:42.889
and un-amended train wreck of failures

03:42.973 --> 03:44.724
that have brought us to now.

03:44.808 --> 03:48.185
I'm a leader in an industry
that miscalled election results,

03:48.270 --> 03:51.272
hyped up terror scares,
ginned up controversy,

03:51.356 --> 03:54.567
and failed to report
on tectonic shifts in our country.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.652
From the collapse of the financial system

03:56.737 --> 03:58.446
to the truths about how strong we are

03:58.530 --> 04:01.073
to the dangers we actually face.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.326
I'm a leader in an industry that misdirected

04:03.410 --> 04:06.662
your attention with
the dexterity of Harry Houdini,

04:06.747 --> 04:08.372
while sending hundreds of thousands

04:08.457 --> 04:10.416
of our bravest young men and women

04:10.500 --> 04:13.502
off to war without due diligence.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.213
The reason we failed isn't a mystery.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.174
We took a dive for the ratings.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.635
In the infancy of mass communication,

04:20.719 --> 04:22.803
the Columbus and Magellan
of broadcast journalism,

04:22.888 --> 04:24.764
William Paley and David Sarnoff,

04:24.848 --> 04:27.516
went down to Washington
to cut a deal with Congress.

04:28.060 --> 04:30.061
Congress would allow the fledgling networks

04:30.145 --> 04:32.521
free use of taxpayer-owned airwaves

04:32.606 --> 04:35.149
in exchange for one public service.

04:35.233 --> 04:37.652
That public service would
be one hour of air time

04:37.736 --> 04:41.030
set aside every night
for informational broadcasting,

04:41.114 --> 04:43.449
or what we now call the evening news.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.786
Congress, unable to anticipate
the enormous capacity

04:46.870 --> 04:50.665
television would have to
deliver consumers to advertisers,

04:50.749 --> 04:53.167
failed to include in its deal
the one requirement

04:53.251 --> 04:55.461
that would have changed
our national discourse

04:55.545 --> 04:57.129
immeasurably for the better.

04:57.547 --> 05:00.299
Congress forgot to add
that under no circumstances

05:00.384 --> 05:02.176
could there be paid advertising

05:02.260 --> 05:04.387
during informational broadcasting.

05:04.721 --> 05:08.891
They forgot to say that taxpayers
will give you the airwaves for free,

05:08.976 --> 05:11.519
and for 23 hours a day
you should make a profit,

05:11.603 --> 05:14.563
but for one hour a night, you work for us.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.149
And now those network newscasts,

05:17.234 --> 05:19.902
anchored through history
by honest-to-God newsmen

05:19.987 --> 05:22.822
with names like Murrow
and Reasoner and Huntley

05:22.906 --> 05:26.325
and Brinkley and Buckley
and Cronkite and Rather

05:26.410 --> 05:29.787
and Russert, now they have to
compete with the likes of me,

05:29.913 --> 05:32.957
a cable anchor
who's in the exact same business

05:33.083 --> 05:34.917
as the producers of Jersey Shore.

05:35.877 --> 05:37.920
And that business was good to us,

05:38.005 --> 05:40.673
but News Night is quitting
that business right now.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.425
It might come as a surprise to you

05:42.509 --> 05:45.761
that some of history's greatest
American journalists are working right now,

05:46.096 --> 05:48.014
exceptional minds with years of experience

05:48.098 --> 05:50.933
and an unshakeable devotion
to reporting the news.

05:51.727 --> 05:53.853
But these voices are a small minority now

05:53.937 --> 05:55.896
and they don't stand a chance
against the circus,

05:55.981 --> 05:59.275
when the circus comes to town.
They're overmatched.

05:59.651 --> 06:02.611
I'm quitting the circus, switching teams.

06:03.113 --> 06:05.406
I'm going with the guys
who are getting creamed.

06:05.490 --> 06:08.159
I'm moved they still think they can win,

06:08.243 --> 06:10.536
and I hope they can teach me a thing or two.

06:10.620 --> 06:13.372
From this moment on,
we'll be deciding what goes on our air

06:13.457 --> 06:15.833
and how it's presented to you
based on the simple truth

06:15.959 --> 06:18.377
that nothing is more important
to a democracy

06:18.462 --> 06:20.004
than a well-informed electorate.

06:20.797 --> 06:23.215
We'll endeavor to put information
in a broader context

06:23.300 --> 06:25.259
because we know that very little news is born

06:25.343 --> 06:27.803
at the moment it comes across our wire.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.555
We'll be the champion of facts

06:29.639 --> 06:32.850
and the mortal enemy
of innuendo, speculation,

06:32.976 --> 06:35.186
hyperbole, and nonsense.

06:35.270 --> 06:36.937
We're not waiters in a restaurant

06:37.022 --> 06:40.024
serving you the stories you asked for,
just the way you like them prepared.

06:40.150 --> 06:43.027
Nor are we computers
dispensing only the facts

06:43.153 --> 06:46.781
because news is only useful
in the context of humanity.

06:47.032 --> 06:49.742
I'll make no effort to
subdue my personal opinions.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.702
I will make every effort to expose you

06:51.828 --> 06:54.038
to informed opinions that
are different from my own.

06:54.581 --> 06:57.666
You may ask,
"Who are we to make these decisions?"

06:58.543 --> 07:01.587
We are MacKenzie McHale and myself.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.131
Ms. McHale is our executive producer.

07:04.216 --> 07:06.926
She marshals the resources
of over 100 reporters,

07:07.010 --> 07:08.552
producers, analysts, and technicians,

07:08.678 --> 07:11.430
and her credentials are readily available.

07:11.848 --> 07:13.474
I'm News Night's managing editor,

07:13.558 --> 07:15.392
and make the final decision
on everything seen

07:15.477 --> 07:16.727
and heard on this program.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.022
Who are we to make these decisions?

07:20.816 --> 07:22.983
We're the media elite.

07:24.027 --> 07:26.946
We'll be back after this with the news.

07:27.697 --> 07:29.031
It would be accurate to say it started

07:29.116 --> 07:30.991
with his on-air apology.

07:31.076 --> 07:33.452
Pardon, it would be accurate to say
what started?

07:33.537 --> 07:35.246
Was he aware that he went on television

07:35.372 --> 07:36.956
and said everything his network had done

07:37.040 --> 07:38.624
up until that point was trash?

07:38.708 --> 07:41.293
I think he was fully aware of what he said

07:41.378 --> 07:43.170
and that he was on television when he said it.

07:43.255 --> 07:44.964
He also took responsibility for himself

07:45.048 --> 07:47.216
and not the network or the company.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.135
What are we talking about?

07:51.805 --> 07:53.848
Mmm. Hey.

07:54.391 --> 07:56.350
You're working late.

07:56.768 --> 07:59.061
Well, it was either this or go home.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.856
- So...
- Listen, I was at a bar.

08:01.940 --> 08:04.150
I saw the show tonight at a bar.

08:04.693 --> 08:05.985
And I may have been overserved.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.445
I'm fine, I'm just... If I say anything...

08:08.530 --> 08:10.447
You want to sit down?

08:13.243 --> 08:16.245
How much did you have to do
with writing that opening tonight?

08:17.455 --> 08:18.455
Uh...

08:19.332 --> 08:21.041
It was something Will wanted to do.

08:21.126 --> 08:24.044
- He passed it around.
- I would have loved to have been part of that.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.008
I could have done the show
you guys want to do.

08:29.092 --> 08:30.759
I'm equipped for that.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.553
God, Don, that's...

08:33.805 --> 08:36.473
You can. You can.

08:36.558 --> 08:40.019
You guys can follow up.
You can expand, you can rebut.

08:40.103 --> 08:41.979
I've got a mandate.

08:43.106 --> 08:45.357
Bring viewers to 10:00.

08:45.442 --> 08:49.445
I don't, and they'll try someone else
until someone does.

08:50.071 --> 08:52.489
I have to cover Natalee Holloway.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.326
And you guys just set me up
to look like an asshole

08:55.410 --> 08:57.119
before I even got a chance to get started.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.413
- That wasn't...
- No, shut up.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.668
That wasn't our intent.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.795
And you can insist...

09:07.088 --> 09:09.089
You can insist on...

09:16.264 --> 09:19.225
That's what you were reading
on your BlackBerry, right?

09:19.309 --> 09:20.684
Yeah.

09:20.769 --> 09:23.812
I mean, it said, "Eyes only," baby.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.066
I've got eyes.

09:29.903 --> 09:33.072
The apology was a Monday.
The following Saturday

09:33.156 --> 09:34.490
was the Times Square bomb.

09:34.616 --> 09:36.408
By Tuesday, we had all the facts.

09:36.493 --> 09:39.119
This is the kind of story that
makes people want to turn on the news,

09:39.204 --> 09:40.454
so you want to take advantage of it.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.790
- That's News 101, right?
- What is this meeting?

09:42.874 --> 09:45.918
- Is it News 101?
- To artificially hype the threat of a bomb?

09:46.002 --> 09:48.295
You're confusing it with Douchebaggery 101.

09:48.380 --> 09:50.589
- And the Muslim?
- That was a borderline call,

09:50.674 --> 09:52.883
but they're qualified to make borderline calls.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.261
- What is this meeting about?
- Keep going.

09:55.345 --> 09:59.014
By comparison, CBS had Katie
open her show from Times Square,

09:59.099 --> 10:01.558
while News Night
gave it three minutes and 20 seconds.

10:01.643 --> 10:03.143
Basically said
there was nothing to worry about

10:03.228 --> 10:05.229
and, as you said,
mentioned that one of the people

10:05.313 --> 10:06.563
who notified the police was a Muslim.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.649
That's called
squandering an opportunity.

10:08.733 --> 10:11.568
These are the important facts.
First, it was a lone wolf.

10:11.695 --> 10:14.989
Shahzad was trained in Pakistan,
but he wasn't connected to a terror network.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.449
Second, the situation was
handled by first responders

10:17.534 --> 10:19.201
and law enforcement, not an army.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.786
And finally, the system worked.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.246
He was taken off the plane by a final check

10:22.372 --> 10:24.623
of the flight manifest by a US Customs officer.

10:24.708 --> 10:27.459
What about the fact he was allowed
on the plane in the first place,

10:27.544 --> 10:29.837
10 hours after the Feds
put him on a no-fly list?

10:29.921 --> 10:31.672
The airline hadn't updated its files yet,

10:31.756 --> 10:34.300
which is why Customs and Border Protection
does a second check.

10:34.384 --> 10:37.303
- That's the system working.
- Three minutes at the top.

10:37.387 --> 10:38.887
- Will?
- Agree.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.514
You understand
we're making a conscious choice now

10:40.598 --> 10:42.433
to do the boring version of the story?

10:42.517 --> 10:44.351
- That's not how I'd put it, but...
- Great.

10:44.936 --> 10:47.062
- Mac, there's one more thing.
- Yeah?

10:47.230 --> 10:49.481
Everyone's reporting that
it was a T-shirt vendor

10:49.566 --> 10:52.609
named Lance Orton who
spotted the smoking car and called 911.

10:52.694 --> 10:56.113
- It was.
- I know, but it turns out Lance Orton

10:56.197 --> 10:59.616
was alerted to the smoking car
by a photograph vendor named Aliou Niasse,

10:59.701 --> 11:02.077
- an immigrant from Senegal.
- Why haven't we heard about this guy?

11:02.203 --> 11:04.413
Two possible reasons.
One is that he didn't make the call.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.248
He said, umm...

11:06.916 --> 11:10.044
"I thought I should call 911,
but my English is not very good

11:10.128 --> 11:11.754
"and I had no credit left on my phone.

11:11.838 --> 11:14.757
"So I walked over to Lance, who has
a T-shirt stall next to mine and told him."

11:15.050 --> 11:16.925
What's the second possible reason
we haven't heard about him?

11:17.135 --> 11:19.136
- He's a Muslim.
- How'd you get this?

11:19.262 --> 11:21.263
A Pakistani blog.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.140
It's not the world's most reliable source.

11:23.266 --> 11:26.477
I know, so I confirmed it
with the NYPD, and it's true.

11:26.561 --> 11:28.354
And The Times of London has it online.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.522
And I think if the religion
of the bomber is important,

11:30.648 --> 11:33.650
then so is the religion of
the guy who saved everyone's life.

11:41.910 --> 11:43.786
- So do I.
- All right.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.913
3:20 at the top.

11:46.081 --> 11:47.748
How many viewers did he lose that night?

11:47.832 --> 11:49.249
Well, we all know he made enemies that night

11:49.334 --> 11:51.168
out of Fox and right-wing radio.

11:51.294 --> 11:53.837
- A lot of negative press.
- How many viewers did he lose?

11:54.130 --> 11:55.547
People want the most
up-to-date information.

11:55.632 --> 11:56.590
They were getting it.

11:56.674 --> 11:58.926
Didn't feel like it when everyone else
was saying it's a genuine threat,

11:59.010 --> 12:00.761
- and he's talking about...
- It didn't feel like it?

12:00.845 --> 12:02.304
- How many?
- 7%.

12:03.139 --> 12:05.265
He gave back the gains
he made after Northwestern.

12:05.350 --> 12:09.561
And that's the kind of thing
that would ordinarily scare Will straight.

12:09.646 --> 12:10.979
But it didn't.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.981
Media Matters, Think Progress,

12:13.066 --> 12:16.235
Howard Kurtz,
and the Columbia Journalism Review

12:16.319 --> 12:19.113
all praised our coverage
of the Times Square bomb.

12:19.322 --> 12:21.156
Do any of them advertise on our network?

12:21.324 --> 12:23.075
I don't believe they advertise anywhere.

12:23.284 --> 12:25.494
And by any chance
was it around this time

12:25.578 --> 12:29.581
that Will had some kind of
epiphany about the Tea Party?

12:29.666 --> 12:31.583
The Tea Party isn't what it started out to be.

12:31.668 --> 12:32.793
Have you slept?

12:32.877 --> 12:35.045
I got up at 2:00 a.m.
And broke down polling data

12:35.130 --> 12:37.297
from the Republican Senate
primary race in Utah.

12:37.382 --> 12:39.216
I never heard anyone say that before.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.218
Someone faxed me the polling data.
I don't even know who.

12:41.302 --> 12:44.221
But that doesn't matter.
Bob Bennett, the most conservative member

12:44.347 --> 12:47.516
of the Senate, is going to lose
his primary race to a guy named Mike Lee

12:47.600 --> 12:49.476
'cause Lee found room to the right of Bennett.

12:49.561 --> 12:51.228
You wouldn't think that was possible.

12:51.354 --> 12:54.231
Back in 1968, when Rennie Davis
and Hayden and their guys

12:54.357 --> 12:57.651
organized the SDS,
it was specifically to end the Vietnam War.

12:57.735 --> 12:59.736
But that movement
got eaten by Abbie Hoffman

12:59.821 --> 13:01.155
and Jerry Rubin and the Yippies.

13:01.239 --> 13:03.782
Hoffman and Rubin
were a lot more charismatic.

13:03.867 --> 13:06.243
Yeah, but it was impossible to define
what the Yippies were protesting.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.579
They were about giving the finger
to anyone over 30,

13:08.663 --> 13:10.497
generically hating
the American establishment,

13:10.582 --> 13:12.916
- dropping out, and getting high.
- And?

13:13.042 --> 13:15.836
That's how the progressive movement
would be painted for the next 40 years.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.796
People passing out daisies to soldiers

13:17.881 --> 13:19.381
and trying to levitate the Pentagon.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.758
- I was there. That damn near worked.
- No, it didn't.

13:21.843 --> 13:23.760
The Pentagon's a really big building.
You can't levitate it.

13:23.845 --> 13:25.888
How is there room to
the right of Bob Bennett?

13:25.972 --> 13:28.640
For starters, a centerpiece
of Mike Lee's stump speech

13:28.725 --> 13:31.310
is effectively eliminating
the part of the 14th Amendment

13:31.394 --> 13:34.104
that says a citizen born
in the US is a US citizen.

13:34.189 --> 13:37.691
It's an applause line, and he's
going to win his primary by double digits.

13:37.775 --> 13:41.987
Charlie, I understood the Tea Party
in the beginning,

13:42.071 --> 13:43.489
just like I understood the SDS.

13:43.573 --> 13:45.616
The Tea Party was a middle-class movement

13:45.700 --> 13:48.076
responding spontaneously to bad trends.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.579
Wages were stagnant,
jobs were disappearing,

13:50.663 --> 13:53.081
Wall Street got trillions,
and everybody was laughing at them.

13:53.625 --> 13:56.335
- But?
- They've been co-opted by the radical right,

13:56.419 --> 13:59.379
which in turn has enslaved
the Republican middle.

13:59.464 --> 14:03.175
So you think the '60s radicals and
the Tea Party are roughly the same?

14:03.259 --> 14:04.468
With one big exception.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.303
Even at the height of 1968,

14:06.387 --> 14:08.847
the Democrats wouldn't have
nominated Abbie Hoffman

14:08.932 --> 14:10.641
or Jerry Rubin for any office,

14:10.725 --> 14:13.185
and no candidate would have
sought their endorsement.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.021
Can you imagine Humphrey or Kennedy

14:16.105 --> 14:19.358
standing for a photo op with
Bernardine Dohrn or Allen Ginsberg?

14:19.442 --> 14:20.859
- Get there.
- Oh!

14:20.944 --> 14:23.695
- I didn't even know you were here.
- Get there.

14:23.780 --> 14:26.365
The Tea Party is being radicalized

14:26.449 --> 14:29.409
and their original
organizing principles obliterated.

14:29.494 --> 14:31.203
And no one should be laughing anymore.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.788
They should be scared shitless.

14:33.289 --> 14:35.916
My party's being hijacked,
and it's happening in real time.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.502
How is this not our top story every night?

14:38.586 --> 14:41.463
- Thank you.
- Seriously, how did you get there?

14:41.589 --> 14:43.882
You're not gonna be
very popular with Republicans.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.634
Hoffman and Rubin weren't Democrats,

14:45.718 --> 14:47.219
and these guys aren't Republicans.

14:47.303 --> 14:48.971
It needs to be a Republican saying it.

14:49.138 --> 14:52.140
Top story every night till the plant
from Little Shop of Horrors

14:52.225 --> 14:54.059
goes back to its planet.

14:56.563 --> 14:59.064
I think you've got the boy coming around.

14:59.148 --> 15:01.483
You're the one who faxed him
the Utah polling data, right?

15:13.830 --> 15:16.915
In four, three, two... Rolling.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.294
Your candidate Mike Lee
is a fierce supporter of the Constitution.

15:20.378 --> 15:22.129
That's why he's our candidate.

15:22.213 --> 15:24.423
Should he win in the general election,

15:24.507 --> 15:26.216
which seems likely since Utah
hasn't sent a Democrat

15:26.301 --> 15:27.968
to the Senate in 40 years,

15:28.052 --> 15:31.346
he'll have to swear an oath
to protect and defend the Constitution.

15:31.472 --> 15:33.682
And I'm looking forward
to being there when he does.

15:33.850 --> 15:36.810
He's also signed a note
to Grover Norquist not to raise taxes.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.937
- That's right.
- Which oath is he bound by?

15:39.022 --> 15:40.397
He'll be bound by both.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.524
- Is that possible?
- Of course it is.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.735
And that's how we're going to
rein in government spending.

15:44.819 --> 15:48.071
Do you think part of a senator's job
should include listening to experts,

15:48.197 --> 15:51.199
considering new information,
hearing dissenting opinions,

15:51.284 --> 15:53.910
- and then casting his best vote?
- I sure do.

15:54.037 --> 15:57.497
If 10 Nobel Prize-winning economists
were to walk into his office

15:57.582 --> 16:00.667
and say, "This is a national emergency
and we need to increase revenue

16:00.752 --> 16:03.962
"by asking for a small sacrifice
from the wealthiest 1% of us."

16:04.047 --> 16:05.756
Mike Lee wouldn't even discuss it?

16:06.132 --> 16:08.842
Based on his zero years
of experience in economics

16:08.926 --> 16:12.137
and tax policy,
he's taken an oath not to learn anything new

16:12.221 --> 16:14.181
while a member of the US Senate?

16:14.265 --> 16:18.060
When you blur the distinction
between public and private,

16:18.144 --> 16:19.353
there are problems.

16:19.437 --> 16:22.522
Same thing when you blur the distinction
between answers and nonsense.

16:22.607 --> 16:24.232
Does a private restaurant in Kentucky

16:24.317 --> 16:26.568
have the right to
deny service to black people?

16:26.653 --> 16:28.236
What it gets into is this.

16:28.363 --> 16:30.989
If you decide that
restaurants are publically owned.

16:31.074 --> 16:32.532
Restaurants are privately owned,

16:32.617 --> 16:34.951
and it was a yes or no question
that should be easy to answer.

16:35.036 --> 16:37.037
Does Rand Paul believe
that a private business

16:37.121 --> 16:40.165
should be allowed to discriminate
on the basis of race?

16:40.249 --> 16:42.167
Sharron Angle's angry because the press

16:42.251 --> 16:44.753
is reporting what she says to the press.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.505
The statement goes on.

16:46.589 --> 16:49.007
"We needed to have the press be our friend.

16:49.092 --> 16:52.552
"We wanted them to ask the questions
we want to answer."

16:52.845 --> 16:55.597
Do not laugh.
I felt the exact same way about the bar exam.

16:57.517 --> 16:58.684
Will just made a joke.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.186
When did that newsroom
become a courtroom?

17:01.354 --> 17:02.854
I was going to say the same thing.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.774
- He was a prosecutor.
- I'm sorry?

17:06.609 --> 17:09.027
Before he was an anchor,
before he was a reporter,

17:09.112 --> 17:11.905
before he was a speechwriter,
he was a prosecutor.

17:11.989 --> 17:15.325
He graduated college at 19, law school at 21,

17:15.410 --> 17:18.370
and had signed up
with the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office,

17:18.454 --> 17:21.623
where he racked up a 94% conviction record.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.543
The newsroom turned into
a courtroom, Reese,

17:24.627 --> 17:28.880
because I made the decision
that American voters need a fucking lawyer.

17:29.090 --> 17:30.549
"You know, our Founding Fathers,

17:30.633 --> 17:33.301
"they put that 2nd Amendment
in there for a good reason,

17:33.386 --> 17:35.679
"and that was for the people
to protect themselves

17:35.763 --> 17:37.681
"against a tyrannical government.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.891
"I hope that's not where we're going,
but, you know,

17:39.976 --> 17:42.018
"if this Congress keeps going the way it is,

17:42.103 --> 17:46.022
"people are really looking towards
those Second Amendment remedies."

17:46.774 --> 17:48.692
Syntax problems notwithstanding,

17:49.235 --> 17:51.611
that was a Republican nominee
for the US Senate

17:51.696 --> 17:55.323
saying she hasn't ruled out
a violent overthrow of her government.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.034
Terry Smith is up next
with The Capitol Report.

17:58.161 --> 17:59.828
I'm Will McAvoy. Good night.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.121
And we're clear.

18:06.169 --> 18:07.961
- Hello.
- Hi.

18:08.045 --> 18:09.796
You're dressed much too nicely to work here.

18:09.881 --> 18:11.965
No, I'm meeting Will. We're going out.

18:13.176 --> 18:15.218
- You're going out?
- Yeah.

18:15.303 --> 18:18.388
Are you a relative of Will's? Are you related?

18:18.473 --> 18:21.057
No. No, we're going on a date.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.394
That's fantastic!

18:25.688 --> 18:27.272
I don't know why I said that so loud.

18:27.356 --> 18:30.776
How do you guys know each...

18:30.860 --> 18:32.110
- How did you meet?
- Mac, I think...

18:32.195 --> 18:33.445
- Not now.
- Okay.

18:33.529 --> 18:36.364
- How do you know Will?
- I work for the Jets, and Will's a big fan.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.492
- The New York Jets?
- Yeah.

18:38.576 --> 18:41.119
- We met in the owner's...
- That's sensational.

18:41.412 --> 18:43.538
...suite.
- What do you do for the Jets?

18:43.623 --> 18:46.041
- I'm head of the Flight Crew.
- You're a pilot?

18:46.375 --> 18:49.336
I'm head of the cheerleading squad.
We're called the Flight Crew.

18:49.420 --> 18:51.797
- You're a cheerleader.
- And choreographer.

18:51.881 --> 18:54.299
- It pays for graduate school.
- Hey, Danielle.

18:54.383 --> 18:57.052
- Hey, dude. That was awesome.
- No.

18:57.136 --> 19:00.514
I was sitting watching you right there,
while you were right there.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.391
You want to hear something
that will blow your mind?

19:03.476 --> 19:05.519
In about three hours,
he'll be on TV on the West Coast,

19:05.603 --> 19:08.730
while at the same time out with you on a date.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.733
Unless he gets tired,
which happens sometimes because he's old.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.652
This is MacKenzie McHale.
She's my secretary.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.821
Multiple Peabody-winning
executive producer.

19:15.905 --> 19:18.448
- I'm Danielle.
- That's a beautiful name!

19:18.533 --> 19:20.867
- Why are you shouting?
- Can I talk to you for a second?

19:20.952 --> 19:22.702
Just give me a minute to change.
We'll be out of here.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.959
You're going on a date with a cheerleader?

19:29.043 --> 19:31.002
Not a high school cheerleader.
A professional cheerleader.

19:31.087 --> 19:32.838
- That doesn't make it better.
- Can I help you?

19:32.922 --> 19:34.840
- She's a student.
- A graduate student.

19:34.924 --> 19:37.217
- In philosophy?
- Physical therapy.

19:37.301 --> 19:38.760
There are better ways to get back at me.

19:39.095 --> 19:40.345
I'll put up a suggestion box.

19:40.429 --> 19:41.847
Can I warn you about something?

19:41.931 --> 19:43.598
You're a rich and famous person.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.892
And for that reason only,
she may want to sleep with you.

19:45.977 --> 19:48.061
That didn't sound like something
that should come with a warning.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.105
That sounded like something
that should come with balloons.

19:51.607 --> 19:52.983
I loathe you right now.

19:53.150 --> 19:55.694
- You've got ink on your face.
- I work with pens!

19:55.778 --> 19:58.154
- Get a grip.
- Yeah, I know!

19:58.656 --> 19:59.906
- Hello.
- Whatever!

19:59.991 --> 20:01.283
- Good show tonight.
- Thank you.

20:01.367 --> 20:02.784
He was talking to me!

20:03.369 --> 20:05.120
Stay on the Tea Party.

20:05.288 --> 20:07.622
Hardcore conservatives are getting primaried.

20:07.790 --> 20:10.709
In six weeks, I haven't heard
anything from the 44th floor.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.878
- How are they with this?
- Good. Good.

20:12.962 --> 20:15.297
I'll tell you
when there's something to worry about.

20:16.799 --> 20:19.301
So now we've really got something
to worry about 'cause he goes out...

20:19.427 --> 20:21.595
What problem do we have? 7% drop?

20:21.679 --> 20:23.680
We lose that when the Yankees
are playing the Red Sox.

20:23.806 --> 20:27.142
Brad, why did you say, "Now we've really
got something to worry about"?

20:27.226 --> 20:28.810
He goes after Jim DeMint.

20:29.186 --> 20:31.271
Mr. Wexler, I'd like to
talk about Senator DeMint's

20:31.355 --> 20:33.023
recent statements about gay marriage.

20:33.149 --> 20:35.400
He said it shouldn't be legal
because of the diseases

20:35.484 --> 20:37.444
prevalent in the homosexual population.

20:37.528 --> 20:39.863
- Am I mischaracterizing that?
- No, sir, you're not.

20:39.989 --> 20:43.116
By diseases, Senator DeMint
is referring to HIV and AIDS?

20:43.200 --> 20:45.076
- 18,000.
- Exactly. Normal, God-fearing

20:45.161 --> 20:47.412
heterosexual couples
don't spread those kinds of diseases.

20:47.496 --> 20:48.580
18,000.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.040
As a matter of fact,
the rate of contraction of HIV

20:50.124 --> 20:53.251
among gay couples is now lower
than it is among heterosexual couples.

20:53.336 --> 20:55.211
18,000. Nod if you copy.

20:55.296 --> 20:58.256
Well, if you're talking about Africa,
I'd have to see the statistics for myself.

20:58.341 --> 21:00.050
They're in a packet right in front of you.

21:00.176 --> 21:03.178
But let me ask you something.
Do you believe that the American soldiers

21:03.262 --> 21:05.931
who fought in World War I
were good, moral people?

21:06.182 --> 21:07.599
I'm sure they were, and God bless them.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.017
I don't think He did bless them

21:09.101 --> 21:13.355
because 18,000 US troops were
sidelined by VD during that war.

21:13.439 --> 21:14.689
That sounds a little high to be believed.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.191
- Did you pull those numbers out of...
- I'm sorry.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.568
- That number was wrong.
- That's what I thought.

21:18.653 --> 21:20.987
It was 18,000 every day.

21:21.989 --> 21:23.406
So that second segment was too long.

21:23.491 --> 21:25.533
- Yes, it won't happen again.
- Good.

21:26.535 --> 21:27.535
Uh-oh.

21:27.745 --> 21:29.663
Let's see who we have tonight.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.706
Hi.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.084
You must be waiting for Will.

21:34.168 --> 21:35.585
Yes, I'm Darshana Yadav.

21:35.670 --> 21:38.004
MacKenzie McHale. So has he...

21:38.089 --> 21:39.965
- Hey, Darshana.
- Hey. I caught the end.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.424
- You were great.
- Oh, thank you.

21:41.509 --> 21:43.301
Do you mind waiting just a second
while I change?

21:43.386 --> 21:45.804
- Sure.
- Nice meeting you.

21:47.556 --> 21:48.807
Spinning instructor?

21:48.891 --> 21:50.684
Neurologist at Columbia Presbyterian.

21:50.768 --> 21:52.686
Chief of Surgery.
That would make her a brain surgeon.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.270
Literally a brain surgeon.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.609
That's not hard to be.

22:05.408 --> 22:08.451
I just couldn't be less interested in WikiLeaks.

22:08.536 --> 22:10.203
You're nuts.

22:10.287 --> 22:11.830
The open sourcing of classified information

22:11.914 --> 22:15.000
is going to be an absolute game changer
for journalists of our generation.

22:15.084 --> 22:17.669
All I heard was sounds
coming from the mouth of a nerd.

22:17.753 --> 22:19.671
- Have you scanned the WikiLeaks cables?
- No, Neal.

22:19.755 --> 22:23.675
Because I spend my time
trying to find and protect my sources.

22:23.801 --> 22:26.136
This, right here, is always
the swan song of the obsolete

22:26.220 --> 22:27.929
when you stare the future paradigm
in the face.

22:28.514 --> 22:30.974
"He on the side of technology wins."
You know who said that?

22:31.058 --> 22:33.476
- It was you. I was sitting right here.
- Napoleon.

22:34.103 --> 22:35.311
Things worked out well for him.

22:37.523 --> 22:40.233
Weren't there girls
standing here a minute ago?

22:40.943 --> 22:44.529
Yes, you scared them off
with your WikiNerd pitch.

22:59.962 --> 23:01.463
Hey.

23:08.304 --> 23:12.057
I've been sitting here for two-and-a-half hours
and I still don't know why.

23:12.683 --> 23:15.018
It's like being in the cast of a Fellini film.

23:15.102 --> 23:18.063
Was it all GOP bashing,
or did we cover anything else?

23:18.147 --> 23:21.399
We did almost three times
as many international news stories

23:21.484 --> 23:23.902
as Fox and MSNBC combined.

23:23.986 --> 23:25.570
And unless we're all blind,

23:25.654 --> 23:28.531
the Tea Party is the one
doing the GOP bashing.

23:28.657 --> 23:30.533
- Charlie, give me a break.
- Ask Bryce Delaney.

23:30.785 --> 23:33.495
Bryce Delaney became
the sixth GOP incumbent

23:33.579 --> 23:35.288
to be ousted by a Tea Party candidate.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.290
The American Conservative Union

23:37.374 --> 23:41.002
gives Delaney a 97% rating
over his 10 terms in Congress.

23:41.087 --> 23:43.338
He was a Deputy Whip, he was state co-chair

23:43.422 --> 23:45.090
of the McCain-Palin campaign,

23:45.174 --> 23:48.134
and he sponsored or cosponsored
38 pieces of legislation

23:48.219 --> 23:49.636
that were signed into law.

23:50.179 --> 23:52.639
He lost his primary to a dentist,

23:52.723 --> 23:54.224
72-28.

23:54.308 --> 23:56.309
Congressman Delaney,
thank you for joining us.

23:56.519 --> 23:57.560
Thank you.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.562
Congressman, you have
a consistent voting record

23:59.647 --> 24:01.106
on conservative issues,

24:01.190 --> 24:03.233
and in the past five elections
you've won your district

24:03.317 --> 24:05.110
by double digits. What happened?

24:05.194 --> 24:07.570
My pollster tells me

24:07.655 --> 24:10.073
that I gave the wrong answer
at a town hall meeting.

24:10.324 --> 24:11.533
What was the question?

24:11.742 --> 24:14.285
Is President Obama a socialist?

24:14.370 --> 24:15.453
And your answer?

24:15.538 --> 24:18.915
My answer was that I disagree with the man

24:18.999 --> 24:20.917
on how to run a government,

24:21.001 --> 24:24.546
but the talk of him being
a socialist or a Marxist

24:24.630 --> 24:27.006
or a Kenyan was a silly distraction.

24:27.091 --> 24:28.424
You paid a big price for that.

24:28.509 --> 24:30.844
You were leading in the polls at the time.

24:31.804 --> 24:34.973
Will, there are brilliant conservative minds
in the Republican Party,

24:35.057 --> 24:37.058
and the individual price we are paying

24:37.184 --> 24:40.228
for not pretending to be crazy is nothing

24:40.312 --> 24:43.439
compared to the price that
the country is going to pay

24:43.566 --> 24:46.276
for not having a reasonable opposition party.

24:46.402 --> 24:49.237
You made another mistake, too, right?

24:49.363 --> 24:52.574
- You're referring to H.R.2559.
- Yes.

24:52.658 --> 24:55.535
- I cosponsored a bill.
- With a Democrat.

24:56.203 --> 24:58.163
Once you're elected, you have a duty

24:58.247 --> 25:00.832
to work with other people
who have been elected.

25:00.916 --> 25:03.501
My friends across the aisle had been elected.

25:03.961 --> 25:06.421
What did H.R.2559 provide for?

25:09.049 --> 25:12.385
It provided for homeless veterans

25:12.970 --> 25:15.430
to receive housing vouchers

25:15.514 --> 25:19.601
and services such as counseling, job training.

25:19.685 --> 25:22.478
Thank you for your service
to your country, sir.

25:22.563 --> 25:25.148
You'll be missed in Congress. Good luck.

25:25.274 --> 25:26.858
Thank you.

25:30.779 --> 25:34.157
It's not strange I'm not hearing
anything from the 44th floor?

25:34.241 --> 25:35.867
What were you expecting?

25:35.951 --> 25:38.453
It's just bizarre because
the show's taken a pretty sharp turn.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.246
Big fan. Keep it up.

25:40.331 --> 25:42.040
She never watched the old show.

25:42.124 --> 25:44.959
- What?
- Maybe once or twice.

25:45.294 --> 25:47.253
Too dumbed down?

25:48.297 --> 25:50.590
Has she seen the new show?

25:50.674 --> 25:52.008
That's a fair question.

25:52.092 --> 25:53.218
Charlie.

25:53.302 --> 25:55.094
She's a Democrat. She gives money.

25:55.221 --> 25:57.805
She gives money to everybody.
She bets on all the horses in the race.

25:57.973 --> 26:00.350
If there was a problem, I'd have heard about it.

26:03.312 --> 26:06.648
There's a retreat in Telluride
my mother and I have been invited to

26:07.691 --> 26:09.901
every year for the last nine years.

26:09.985 --> 26:12.237
We're not here talking about ratings, are we?

26:12.321 --> 26:14.113
I wonder if what we're about to see

26:14.198 --> 26:16.449
has anything to do with
why we weren't invited this year.

26:16.533 --> 26:20.328
Does anybody mind if I start drinking
a lot of bourbon right now,

26:20.454 --> 26:24.249
and then a little while later
put my fist through his head?

26:24.333 --> 26:26.751
I think you've had enough bourbon
for one lifetime.

26:26.835 --> 26:28.127
Not my lifetime.

26:29.380 --> 26:30.296
We lost David and Charles.

26:37.179 --> 26:38.930
Thank you
for staying late tonight.

26:39.014 --> 26:40.723
I really want to get this one right tomorrow.

26:40.808 --> 26:41.933
Don't we want to get them all right?

26:42.017 --> 26:43.601
You know what, Hef?

26:43.686 --> 26:46.604
There's a Hooters a few blocks from here
just filled with waitresses

26:46.689 --> 26:49.107
who are stocked like a game fishing pond

26:49.191 --> 26:53.236
for you to go out like a fish with...

26:53.362 --> 26:55.947
- You lost the thread, right?
- Yeah.

26:56.031 --> 26:58.074
Let's start from the top again.

26:58.242 --> 26:59.492
Maggie.

26:59.868 --> 27:02.495
Ah, the Tea Party presents itself

27:02.579 --> 27:05.915
as a grassroots movement,
uh, which means

27:06.000 --> 27:08.668
it should be fiercely resistant
to central control,

27:08.752 --> 27:11.212
especially traditional...

27:13.465 --> 27:14.590
Sorry. Ahem.

27:15.384 --> 27:18.553
Especially traditional power structures.

27:18.679 --> 27:21.180
We're joined from Manhattan, Kansas,
by Mike Lyndall,

27:21.265 --> 27:22.598
a construction contractor,

27:22.683 --> 27:24.392
and Sheryl Bell, a registered nurse.

27:24.601 --> 27:27.478
Mr. Lyndall and Ms. Bell
are the founders and co-chairs

27:27.563 --> 27:30.565
of the Riley County Tea Party Express.
Welcome.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.942
They're gonna say
the Tea Party represents the voice

27:33.027 --> 27:35.236
of the true owners of the United States.

27:35.321 --> 27:38.239
Mike, tell us why you became involved
with the Tea Party movement.

27:38.324 --> 27:40.491
Well, first and foremost,
we want to take our country back.

27:40.576 --> 27:42.910
All right, just to be clear,
is your country my country, too?

27:43.037 --> 27:44.037
- Of course.
- Okay.

27:44.121 --> 27:45.788
Who do you want to
take our country back from?

27:45.873 --> 27:48.082
We want to take it back from
a Congress and a president

27:48.167 --> 27:50.668
who've forgotten that government
derives its power from the consent

27:50.753 --> 27:52.628
of the governed,
and instead is at the beck and call

27:52.713 --> 27:54.130
of special interests and corporations.

27:54.340 --> 27:57.258
You describe the Tea Party
as a grassroots movement, right?

27:57.384 --> 27:59.552
Absolutely. We have no central control,

27:59.636 --> 28:01.346
no traditional power structure.

28:01.430 --> 28:03.931
And that is something that
seems to confound the media.

28:04.016 --> 28:06.601
- I'm sorry?
- That's what confounds the media.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.144
It's what the media doesn't get.

28:08.270 --> 28:11.439
We are not being run
by a George Soros-type figure.

28:11.607 --> 28:13.816
We are "We the People."

28:13.942 --> 28:15.610
- There it is.
- They walked right into it.

28:15.736 --> 28:19.530
If you follow the money,
nearly all of it eventually leads to AFP.

28:19.615 --> 28:21.157
Where does your funding come from?

28:21.241 --> 28:24.118
What little funding we have
comes from private citizens

28:24.203 --> 28:28.039
who mail in $5, $10, $1,
whatever they can spare.

28:28.165 --> 28:30.833
Okay, have either of you
ever heard the name David Koch?

28:31.251 --> 28:33.294
- I'm sorry?
- David Koch.

28:33.587 --> 28:34.587
No.

28:34.671 --> 28:36.589
Have you ever heard the name Charles Koch?

28:37.132 --> 28:38.174
No.

28:38.258 --> 28:39.967
Have you ever heard
the name Koch Industries?

28:40.427 --> 28:42.345
Are you talking about Coca-Cola?

28:42.429 --> 28:45.848
K-O-C-H. Have either of you
heard of Koch Industries?

28:45.974 --> 28:48.309
- Nope.
- I think that very soon you will.

28:48.435 --> 28:50.478
Koch Industries is the second-largest

28:50.562 --> 28:53.439
private company in the country.
Bigger than Coca-Cola.

28:53.524 --> 28:56.401
And the Koch brothers'
personal wealth of $50 billion

28:56.485 --> 28:58.861
is exceeded only
by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates,

28:58.946 --> 29:02.031
and they could buy and sell
George Soros 10 times over.

29:02.116 --> 29:03.991
They own dozens of
companies and industries,

29:04.076 --> 29:06.786
including oil and gas, refining and chemicals,

29:06.870 --> 29:10.123
minerals, fertilizer, forestry,
polymers and fibers and ranching.

29:10.249 --> 29:13.543
You two both attended the Texas
Defending the American Dream Summit

29:13.627 --> 29:14.710
over the July 4th weekend?

29:14.837 --> 29:16.421
It was a Tea Party event.

29:16.505 --> 29:18.881
The invitation...

29:20.676 --> 29:23.052
Excuse me. The invitation read...

29:23.137 --> 29:24.929
"Today, the voices of average Americans

29:25.013 --> 29:27.682
"are being drowned out by lobbyists
and special interests.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.976
- "But you can do something about it."
Yes.

29:30.060 --> 29:33.521
That summit was paid for
entirely by Americans For Prosperity,

29:33.647 --> 29:36.691
AFP, which has two founders,
David and Charles Koch.

29:37.067 --> 29:39.777
In the last six months,
they've bankrolled Tea Party candidates

29:39.862 --> 29:41.821
in excess of $40 million.

29:42.322 --> 29:45.116
Sheryl, Mike, are the Koch brothers
average Americans

29:45.200 --> 29:48.744
whose voices are being drowned out
by lobbyists and special interests?

29:49.455 --> 29:50.788
I'm confounded.

29:50.914 --> 29:53.040
If we review the graphics package...

29:53.125 --> 29:55.126
- Would you excuse me for a minute?
- Yeah.

29:55.210 --> 29:57.462
- Tamara?
- Yeah.

29:57.546 --> 30:00.131
Call this SS-101.

30:00.215 --> 30:01.799
And I'm gonna want
these reviewed three times

30:01.884 --> 30:02.925
once they're loaded in.

30:03.010 --> 30:04.844
We screw this up,
that's all people talk about tomorrow.

30:04.928 --> 30:06.512
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

30:06.597 --> 30:07.763
SS-101.

30:11.727 --> 30:13.728
- Hey, Don.
- Yeah?

30:14.062 --> 30:16.272
Have you seen Maggie?
She seemed a little funny

30:16.356 --> 30:17.940
in the conference room,
and then she walked out.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.610
Yeah, she's okay.

30:20.694 --> 30:21.694
She gets panic attacks.

30:21.778 --> 30:24.489
She starts to get dizzy and shake
and she thinks she's dying.

30:25.407 --> 30:26.824
Is she all right?

30:26.909 --> 30:29.160
She's fine. She just needs to be left alone.

30:29.453 --> 30:31.245
She went out on the terrace to get some air.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.915
Okay. You guys did a good show tonight.

30:34.166 --> 30:37.293
I wasn't aware of what was going on
with the McRib sandwich.

30:37.419 --> 30:39.587
Yeah. Go fuck yourself.

30:43.759 --> 30:46.552
Do not come down on the Kochs
without checking upstairs.

30:46.637 --> 30:48.971
- Do you understand?
- Get your finger out of my face, Reese.

30:49.097 --> 30:50.848
- Look...
- We stand for something.

30:50.933 --> 30:53.518
It's a moral obligation. Get used to it.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.564
About 10 minutes ago.

30:58.649 --> 31:00.900
About 10 minutes ago at a staff meeting.

31:00.984 --> 31:03.653
Yeah, I have... I need to get back in there.

31:04.363 --> 31:06.822
No, they're not in my pocket.

31:06.949 --> 31:08.783
They're not in my purse because

31:09.159 --> 31:11.369
they weren't in the medicine cabinet.

31:11.453 --> 31:13.329
Lisa, the guys you bring to the apartment

31:13.413 --> 31:17.166
have got to stop taking my Xanax.

31:18.418 --> 31:19.710
Shoot. Hang on a second.

31:19.795 --> 31:20.836
But don't hang up.

31:22.965 --> 31:24.715
- Sit back down.
- I'm fine.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.133
Sit back down.

31:27.678 --> 31:30.555
- Tell me what's happening.
- I just need a minute.

31:30.639 --> 31:31.889
I'm gonna feel your pulse, okay?

31:31.974 --> 31:34.141
You really don't need to.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.771
I'm gonna ask you some questions.

31:38.855 --> 31:40.273
Where are you right now?

31:40.357 --> 31:43.234
Are you having trouble breathing?
Can you hear me?

31:43.360 --> 31:46.028
I'm on the upper terrace of the AWM building,

31:46.113 --> 31:48.573
yes, and obviously yes. Are you a nurse?

31:48.657 --> 31:50.741
Some guys I was embedded with
got panic attacks.

31:52.077 --> 31:54.829
- I'm gonna pass out.
- It feels like it, but you won't.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.748
You're in the second stage
of the A-anxiety table

31:57.833 --> 32:00.167
of Army Field Manual FM 22-51,

32:00.252 --> 32:02.336
"New Infantry Adaptation
to a Threatening Situation."

32:02.421 --> 32:05.256
I'm in Midtown Manhattan, Gomer Pyle.
You're in Fallujah.

32:05.340 --> 32:07.508
Start breathing from your abdomen.

32:07.593 --> 32:09.510
Imagine yourself in a safe place

32:09.636 --> 32:12.263
or something you like. YouTube kittens.

32:12.514 --> 32:14.849
I wish your face would stop moving,
so I could punch it.

32:14.975 --> 32:18.519
You're here. You're part of this group.
Everyone likes you.

32:19.438 --> 32:22.690
Well, except for Carla in bookkeeping
who thinks you're a rube.

32:24.276 --> 32:25.401
Should get back to the meeting.

32:25.485 --> 32:27.028
The meeting's over. Stay put.

32:27.112 --> 32:29.363
- Did the copy for...
- Everything's done.

32:29.489 --> 32:31.449
You can check it yourself later.

32:31.908 --> 32:34.201
He's going after the Koch brothers.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.871
If you want to panic about something,
I think it's six-to-five and pick 'em

32:36.955 --> 32:38.789
this time tomorrow night
the building blows up.

32:40.542 --> 32:42.001
Did you see a doctor?

32:42.085 --> 32:43.794
Yeah, he prescribed Xanax.

32:43.879 --> 32:46.631
- Did you take one?
- I didn't have them with me.

32:46.715 --> 32:49.216
Someone like you should always have one
in your pocket or in your purse.

32:49.509 --> 32:51.927
- I'll remember that.
- Keep breathing, okay?

32:52.179 --> 32:54.263
You're safe. You're awesome.

32:57.392 --> 32:59.560
I'm gonna check your pulse again.

33:03.940 --> 33:05.483
- How is it?
- Better.

33:05.567 --> 33:08.402
A minute ago, it was like
you were taking sniper fire.

33:14.534 --> 33:18.037
They were good guys?
The guys you were embedded with?

33:18.121 --> 33:21.040
They were the best people I've ever met.

33:25.712 --> 33:28.130
You guys are a close second.

33:32.552 --> 33:34.512
Don's hands are tied.

33:34.596 --> 33:37.431
He got marching orders to
get the numbers up at 10:00.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.308
And he's driving a different car than Mac.

33:39.393 --> 33:42.603
Elliot's smart, but he can't do what Will does.

33:42.688 --> 33:44.730
Plus, his salary is tied to ratings.

33:44.815 --> 33:46.774
Why are you telling me this?

33:47.693 --> 33:50.152
He's a great guy
and you two should be friends.

33:51.780 --> 33:53.280
In the five months I've been here,

33:53.365 --> 33:56.033
you two have broken up four times
and gotten together five times.

33:56.118 --> 33:57.368
So there must be a strong connection.

33:57.452 --> 33:58.744
- Was that sarcastic?
- No.

33:58.829 --> 33:59.829
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:59.913 --> 34:01.038
All right.

34:02.582 --> 34:03.791
That was obviously sarcastic.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.042
It wasn't.

34:05.127 --> 34:07.753
I never knew what the word "smug" meant
until I met you.

34:07.838 --> 34:10.798
You're 26 and you didn't know
what the word "smug" meant until this year?

34:10.882 --> 34:12.967
- Right there.
- I wasn't being sarcastic.

34:13.593 --> 34:15.720
You guys obviously have something.

34:17.681 --> 34:20.975
My suggestion is stop breaking up.

34:22.853 --> 34:24.145
Learn how to have a fight.

34:24.271 --> 34:26.355
Go on, Dr. Phil.

34:30.986 --> 34:32.987
You're breathing normally?

34:35.699 --> 34:37.408
Follow my finger.

34:44.124 --> 34:46.375
You've got a graphics producer
waiting in the edit bay.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.178
Are you still there?

34:58.305 --> 35:00.765
Yeah, that was him.

35:01.475 --> 35:04.268
I think the best analogy I can use is Rocky II.

35:04.352 --> 35:06.687
Are you sure that's the best
analogy you can use?

35:06.772 --> 35:07.897
Hear me out.

35:07.981 --> 35:10.024
I'd be very surprised
if my mother has seen Rocky II.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.276
Mrs. Lansing, Rocky Balboa was a lefty.

35:12.360 --> 35:15.196
- Rocky was political?
- Left-handed.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.573
And for his rematch with Apollo Creed,

35:17.657 --> 35:20.367
his trainer Burgess Meredith
makes him train as a righty.

35:20.452 --> 35:22.870
And he fights round after round as a righty

35:22.954 --> 35:24.872
until Burgess Meredith shouts, "Now,"

35:25.248 --> 35:27.082
and Rocky comes at him with his left.

35:27.334 --> 35:28.918
What the fuck are you talking about?

35:29.044 --> 35:31.128
Just that MacKenzie McHale got here,
shouted, "Now,"

35:31.213 --> 35:33.172
and Will started swinging away.

35:33.256 --> 35:36.801
Leave...
Hey, leave Mac out of this.

35:36.885 --> 35:39.136
I shouted, "Now." I'm Burgess Meredith.

35:39.221 --> 35:42.515
This guy,
he don't just want to beat you, see?

35:42.599 --> 35:45.267
He wants to murder you.

35:46.561 --> 35:48.437
That was my best Burgess Meredith.

35:48.855 --> 35:50.397
Is there something here that's funny?

35:50.482 --> 35:53.692
Yeah. We've been talking about Rocky II.

35:53.777 --> 35:55.027
Brad, wrap it up.

36:16.925 --> 36:18.259
Here you go.

36:19.761 --> 36:22.471
- How much do you like me?
- I'm...

36:22.764 --> 36:24.431
You know, I don't know
what's happening right now.

36:24.558 --> 36:26.183
- Don and Maggie broke up.
- When?

36:26.268 --> 36:27.643
Last week.

36:27.727 --> 36:29.770
I'm sure they've married
and divorced three times since then.

36:29.896 --> 36:33.399
- No, it's real.
- What do you mean?

36:33.483 --> 36:35.651
Tess told Tamara, Tamara told Kendra,

36:35.735 --> 36:37.862
and Kendra talked to Maggie,
who confirmed it was over.

36:39.447 --> 36:41.115
So get in there.

36:43.076 --> 36:45.119
- Get in there?
- Yeah.

36:45.203 --> 36:47.705
- I'm not gonna "get in there."
- Why not?

36:47.831 --> 36:51.041
I'm not going to swoop in
like she's a rent-controlled apartment.

36:51.126 --> 36:53.043
She's probably really upset.

36:55.171 --> 36:57.339
Plus, I was the one who advised her

36:57.424 --> 36:58.632
to stay together during these times,

36:58.717 --> 37:00.301
so it would be pretty hypocritical of me
to suddenly...

37:00.385 --> 37:02.553
- Wait.
- What?

37:03.597 --> 37:05.890
You advised her to do what?

37:05.974 --> 37:08.684
I told her if she wants to stay together,
she has to not break up.

37:08.810 --> 37:11.729
Based on what
are you giving relationship advice?

37:11.813 --> 37:13.814
Lt...

37:13.899 --> 37:16.108
This time it was logic.

37:16.610 --> 37:19.904
I know the answer to this question,
but I just want to hear you say it anyway.

37:19.988 --> 37:21.697
What are you working on there?

37:21.823 --> 37:24.491
The story about people voting
against their own interest.

37:28.163 --> 37:29.830
I'm not swooping in.

37:32.042 --> 37:33.751
The health care law hasn't taken effect yet.

37:33.835 --> 37:36.420
TARP was signed into law
by George W. Bush.

37:36.504 --> 37:37.838
Name me the freedoms that
you had the day before

37:37.923 --> 37:40.215
President Obama was sworn in
that you don't have today.

37:40.342 --> 37:42.384
What is someone supposed to do
with a bleeding Mexican?

37:42.469 --> 37:44.970
What state, what city,
what county in this country

37:45.055 --> 37:47.014
is in danger of falling under sharia law?

37:47.140 --> 37:48.182
Tea Party candidate Allen West.

37:48.266 --> 37:49.516
Tea Party candidate Michele Bachmann.

37:49.601 --> 37:51.435
Tea Party candidate Tom Graves. Tim Griffin.

37:51.519 --> 37:52.937
Sean Duffy. Jeff Duncan.

37:53.021 --> 37:55.439
No, ma'am, teen pregnancy
rose over that period.

37:55.607 --> 37:58.359
The largest demographic
of Americans living in poverty are children.

37:58.485 --> 38:00.277
Abolishing the minimum wage
would create jobs.

38:00.362 --> 38:01.612
You know what else would? Slavery.

38:01.696 --> 38:03.447
The public school system has failed you,

38:03.531 --> 38:05.199
as did three of your college professors.

38:05.325 --> 38:07.117
It's going to come down, as it always does,

38:07.202 --> 38:08.827
to who shows up.

38:10.538 --> 38:12.206
And that takes us to last night.

38:12.290 --> 38:15.376
Here's something I want everyone
to watch at home tonight.

38:16.211 --> 38:18.545
All right, precincts are closing
in Kentucky and Indiana.

38:18.630 --> 38:21.799
AP's already calling it for
Rogers, Pence, and Burton.

38:21.883 --> 38:23.425
John Yarmuth just picked up
the Kentucky 3rd.

38:23.510 --> 38:26.053
I'm looking at Patty Murray up 1% with 60 in.
Are we headed for a recount?

38:26.137 --> 38:28.347
Arkansas State Secretary
just certified it for John Boozman.

38:28.431 --> 38:30.474
We've still got Reid up
by 12 in Clark County.

38:30.558 --> 38:32.476
Why's Sportsbook still taking bets
at even money?

38:32.560 --> 38:33.727
- You're getting these?
- Yeah.

38:33.812 --> 38:36.981
I'm looking at the exits.
Did anyone under 70 vote in this election?

38:38.191 --> 38:40.609
I apologize, ma'am. Happy birthday.

38:41.987 --> 38:43.320
Charlie.

38:43.405 --> 38:45.406
Those polls closed 20 minutes ago.
What's going on?

38:46.366 --> 38:48.200
I know he's a friend of yours.

38:50.578 --> 38:53.539
He was a great public servant.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.082
Call it red.

38:55.917 --> 38:58.627
Maggie. Ohio 12, red.

39:00.714 --> 39:02.506
We're gonna need to
pre-pro that map graphic.

39:02.590 --> 39:04.633
Joey, can you get that ready
and let Jake know when it's there?

39:04.718 --> 39:07.136
- Yes, sir.
- Two's down. I need you on Sabbith.

39:07.220 --> 39:08.929
We'll need a photo graphic
for the congressman-elect

39:09.014 --> 39:10.347
and a baseball card of his opponent.

39:10.432 --> 39:12.891
- He's getting a dropline for that.
- Sabbith, two's down.

39:12.976 --> 39:14.852
No, he's back up. Okay, go wide.

39:15.311 --> 39:17.813
Do me a favor.
I need you to fix 1918 and add the source.

39:17.939 --> 39:19.982
I'm looking at the stack
and you're missing 1825.

39:20.233 --> 39:21.734
I see it. It's just not in the stack.

39:21.818 --> 39:24.528
Will, the brand-new governor
of Wisconsin just said,

39:24.612 --> 39:25.988
"Tonight, I want to tell every worker,

39:26.072 --> 39:28.699
"every family, and every business
big or small in this state

39:28.783 --> 39:31.035
"that you have an ally
in the governor's office."

39:31.119 --> 39:33.704
Isn't he the one who wants to bust
the unions? Am I mixing him up?

39:33.788 --> 39:35.164
Can you get him to go to Elliot a little more?

39:35.248 --> 39:36.665
Can you get Elliot to
say something other than

39:36.750 --> 39:38.333
how beautiful it is
to see democracy in action?

39:38.418 --> 39:40.669
- I'm trying.
- Easy, man.

39:41.838 --> 39:42.921
Let's go to three.

39:43.006 --> 39:44.548
Elliot, tell us what we're looking at.

39:44.632 --> 39:48.886
Well, we are looking at
American democracy in action, Will,

39:48.970 --> 39:51.805
and it is really a beautiful sight to see.

39:53.141 --> 39:55.225
Yes, it is. Sloan Sabbith.

39:55.310 --> 39:58.437
We're looking at an electorate
that's older and more conservative.

39:58.521 --> 40:01.482
Early exits suggest a quarter of all voters,
at least so far,

40:01.566 --> 40:05.944
were 65 and older, and 41%
identify themselves with the Tea Party.

40:06.196 --> 40:08.363
Kyle, we all remember those Tea Party signs

40:08.448 --> 40:10.824
that said, "Keep your government hands
off my Social Security."

40:10.909 --> 40:13.494
How do you explain
people who are on Social Security

40:13.578 --> 40:16.830
voting for candidates who could
well endanger Social Security?

40:17.707 --> 40:18.749
I can't.

40:19.793 --> 40:21.919
Well, they don't call you
an analyst for nothing.

40:22.003 --> 40:24.755
We've got 12 minutes
before the next round of polls close.

40:24.839 --> 40:27.299
We'll throw it now to Terry Smith
and her team in Washington

40:27.383 --> 40:28.550
and see you on the other side.

40:28.635 --> 40:31.428
Terry, I don't know how you're gonna
follow Kyle, but give it a try.

40:32.013 --> 40:33.138
We're out.

40:33.681 --> 40:35.974
Hey, you want to give me a break?

40:36.559 --> 40:38.519
- I'm sorry.
- Jesus.

40:38.645 --> 40:40.437
It was a joke.

40:45.193 --> 40:46.527
Come here.

40:50.281 --> 40:51.949
Get in the game, would you, please?

40:52.033 --> 40:54.118
I am in there doing everything I can
to get Mac to get him

40:54.202 --> 40:55.577
to go to you, and he is doing it.

40:55.662 --> 40:57.454
He is inviting you to become a star.

40:57.539 --> 41:00.874
Would you stop being so fucking enthralled
with the act of punching a ballot?

41:00.959 --> 41:03.710
Get back here. Get back here.

41:05.213 --> 41:07.589
Don't talk to me like that.

41:09.050 --> 41:11.301
I mean, I don't know who you think I am,

41:11.386 --> 41:14.888
but don't talk to me like
I am a disappointing child.

41:14.973 --> 41:16.640
You got three choices.

41:16.724 --> 41:19.810
One, get back together with Maggie

41:19.894 --> 41:22.729
so you can be the regular prick that I like

41:22.814 --> 41:26.483
and not the bonus prick
that I've been getting for the past week.

41:26.568 --> 41:30.070
Two, don't get back together with Maggie

41:30.155 --> 41:31.613
and get over it.

41:32.073 --> 41:36.243
Three, you're fired. Choose.

41:37.579 --> 41:38.620
Hmm.

41:39.539 --> 41:41.748
Everything you just said was right.

41:43.001 --> 41:45.169
Let me also say I'm not the one

41:45.253 --> 41:48.046
who wants to be a star, Mama Rose.

41:49.340 --> 41:51.758
I don't know that reference.

41:53.011 --> 41:55.053
It's from Gypsy.

41:55.138 --> 41:57.181
Ethel Merman's a stage mother
who really pushes her daughter...

41:57.265 --> 41:59.349
I don't have time to explain the plot of Gypsy.

41:59.434 --> 42:01.518
Yeah, sure, okay. Just...

42:02.770 --> 42:05.647
Pretend I gave a better pep talk.

42:05.732 --> 42:08.108
- Okay?
- Done.

42:15.158 --> 42:17.034
I printed this hot note.
I'm adding it to your binder.

42:17.118 --> 42:19.953
Lexington, Kentucky, just elected
their first openly gay mayor.

42:20.079 --> 42:21.622
You might want to keep it in your pocket.

42:21.706 --> 42:24.875
Here's what the Grayson camp
sent us on his concession.

42:24.959 --> 42:26.877
And I want to say something to you

42:26.961 --> 42:28.670
that's both inappropriate and insubordinate.

42:28.796 --> 42:30.047
What was the last one?

42:30.131 --> 42:32.132
I want to say something to you
that's inappropriate,

42:32.217 --> 42:35.135
insubordinate, and grounds for termination.

42:35.595 --> 42:39.348
You could give Mac a break and
have the women meet you at the restaurant.

42:50.610 --> 42:52.611
That was inappropriate and insubordinate,

42:52.695 --> 42:53.987
- but I don't care.
- Thank you.

42:54.072 --> 42:56.240
You should know your head's up your ass.

42:56.324 --> 42:58.909
- Will, I know...
- You don't know anything, Maggie.

42:58.993 --> 43:01.954
I've got the image of MacKenzie with that...
With her ex-boy...

43:02.664 --> 43:03.830
It won't come out.

43:03.915 --> 43:07.084
I need the team from Inception
to come and remove the image from...

43:07.543 --> 43:09.795
Look, I'm not doing it on purpose.

43:09.879 --> 43:11.338
I'm not rubbing her face in anything.

43:11.422 --> 43:14.841
I'm simply not considering her feelings at all.

43:18.513 --> 43:20.389
Yeah, I just heard myself say that.

43:21.182 --> 43:23.850
Lexington, Kentucky,
and the Grayson statement.

43:32.110 --> 43:35.445
The Times are reporting
Rick Scott spent 75 million

43:35.530 --> 43:38.740
on his campaign in Florida.
That's the most ever on a gubernatorial race.

43:38.825 --> 43:39.950
Joey, I'm sending you the quote.

43:40.034 --> 43:42.119
- Make it a tear on the NYT background.
- Copy.

43:42.203 --> 43:44.413
- You got a second?
- Are you joking?

43:44.497 --> 43:46.581
I wanted to tell you that I shouldn't have...

43:46.666 --> 43:49.334
- I wanted to apologize.
- This operation is unbelievable.

43:49.419 --> 43:52.045
You guys are like air traffic controllers.

43:52.130 --> 43:54.214
Honey, you're gonna tell me
if I'm in the way, right?

43:54.299 --> 43:57.175
No, you're... No. Wade, this is...

43:57.260 --> 43:59.886
I know who this is. I am not worthy.

44:00.221 --> 44:02.556
You keep kicking
the Tea Party to hell and back.

44:02.640 --> 44:04.850
They won the battle, you win the war.

44:04.934 --> 44:06.560
And I'll tell you what else,
it's good business, too.

44:06.894 --> 44:09.271
Where would Murrow have been
without McCarthy?

44:09.355 --> 44:11.690
- Good to meet you.
- This is my friend, Wade Campbell.

44:11.774 --> 44:13.900
She's so British.
We're a little more than friends.

44:13.985 --> 44:16.445
Mac, you want a cyber panel
next to Will or a lower-third?

44:16.529 --> 44:18.697
She's not British. She's American.

44:19.657 --> 44:22.326
Your call. A cyber panel. Will...

44:22.410 --> 44:25.912
Mac said I could watch tonight so long
as I promised to stay out of your eye line.

44:25.997 --> 44:27.664
She said you never come in here, so...

44:27.749 --> 44:30.709
Yeah, no. I think I got lost
on my way to the men's room.

44:30.793 --> 44:34.588
Martin, would you take Wade
and show him the decision desk?

44:35.256 --> 44:36.506
I would love that.

44:36.591 --> 44:37.799
Sure.

44:42.805 --> 44:45.265
We've been dating for about three months.

44:46.392 --> 44:47.434
I'm sorry.

44:49.103 --> 44:51.897
No. This is exactly
what was supposed to happen.

44:52.440 --> 44:53.607
You're doing great in here.

44:53.691 --> 44:55.150
- Thanks, Will.
- Thanks.

45:00.198 --> 45:03.742
The McClatchy masthead has
to go with that 35-50 graphic.

45:13.002 --> 45:15.045
- Will.
- Yes, ma'am?

45:15.129 --> 45:16.797
You've got to ask the Tea Party
about the debt ceiling.

45:16.923 --> 45:18.048
The debt ceiling.

45:18.132 --> 45:20.425
Boehner'll keep them in line
on the debt ceiling vote.

45:20.510 --> 45:21.843
They're freshmen. They sit in the back.

45:21.928 --> 45:24.679
Half of them won their primaries by
beating candidates Boehner endorsed.

45:24.806 --> 45:27.265
It's pro forma.
It's one sentence on one piece of paper.

45:27.350 --> 45:29.267
It doesn't give the government
permission to borrow more money.

45:29.352 --> 45:32.187
It gives the government permission
to pay back the money we already borrowed.

45:32.271 --> 45:34.106
Do their constituents know that?

45:35.942 --> 45:38.318
- In three, two, roll in.
- Fuck.

45:48.663 --> 45:51.206
Welcome back to ACN's
election night coverage.

45:51.290 --> 45:53.208
If you're just joining us, the Republican Party

45:53.292 --> 45:55.877
will be the majority party
in the House of Representatives

45:55.962 --> 45:57.754
for at least the next two years.

45:58.047 --> 46:01.133
We're joined live now by the newest member
of the 112th Congress,

46:01.217 --> 46:04.136
Frank Guidry, representing
Colorado's 8th district.

46:04.220 --> 46:06.096
Congressman-elect, congratulations.

46:06.180 --> 46:08.723
- Thank you for joining us.
- Good to be here.

46:08.808 --> 46:12.602
Mr. Guidry, you campaigned
on a promise of fiscal responsibility.

46:12.687 --> 46:14.771
And I plan to govern the same way.

46:16.899 --> 46:19.484
Mr. Guidry, in a few months,
you'll be asked to cast

46:19.569 --> 46:22.320
the most important vote
you'll ever cast as a member of the House.

46:22.405 --> 46:24.531
Will you be voting to raise the debt ceiling?

46:24.615 --> 46:28.243
Will, I will not be casting a single vote

46:28.327 --> 46:31.121
to spend a single dollar that we do not have.

46:31.205 --> 46:33.957
Sir, that's not what... That's not...

46:34.041 --> 46:37.085
Mr. Guidry, this is Sloan Sabbith.

46:37.211 --> 46:38.962
That's not what the debt ceiling...

46:39.046 --> 46:40.172
I'm having trouble hearing you.

46:40.256 --> 46:42.007
We've got some happy people
here behind me.

46:42.091 --> 46:44.968
That's not... Sir, that's not
what the debt ceiling does.

46:45.052 --> 46:47.387
- Are you able to hear us?
- Just barely.

46:47.472 --> 46:50.098
Are you aware of the consequences
of not raising the debt ceiling?

46:50.183 --> 46:51.683
I'm sorry, say that again.

46:51.767 --> 46:53.143
Are you aware of the consequences,

46:53.227 --> 46:55.812
the immediate global consequences

46:55.897 --> 46:57.856
of the US defaulting on its loan payments?

46:57.940 --> 46:59.983
I'm sorry, guys. I just can't hear you.

47:00.067 --> 47:02.569
We'll have to pick this up another time.

47:06.157 --> 47:07.449
All right.

47:08.451 --> 47:11.536
Tess, good job. Go home.

47:11.621 --> 47:13.079
Thank you.

47:15.625 --> 47:19.127
Martin, nice work. Get some sleep.

47:19.212 --> 47:21.296
- Hey, Jim.
- Yes, sir?

47:21.422 --> 47:24.674
Smart people are gonna offer you
jobs for more money.

47:24.759 --> 47:26.676
Before you take one, talk to me, okay?

47:26.761 --> 47:28.178
That won't be an issue, sir.

47:28.262 --> 47:29.679
Come have a drink with Will and me.

47:29.764 --> 47:32.015
Oh, thank you very much, but it's pretty late

47:32.099 --> 47:34.351
and it's a work night and I got to be in early.

47:34.435 --> 47:36.311
Oh, be a damn newsman, would you?

47:36.395 --> 47:39.064
- Yes, sir.
- Kids.

47:39.607 --> 47:41.358
The final tally, colon,

47:41.442 --> 47:44.486
Republicans pick up
63 seats in House, comma,

47:44.612 --> 47:47.739
six seats in Senate, comma,
and eight governorships.

47:47.823 --> 47:50.951
Colorado, Alaska, and Washington
still too close to call, period.

47:51.327 --> 47:55.455
This is ACN's Live Election Blog
signing off, period.

47:57.458 --> 48:00.669
I'm sorry, Dave, but I'm afraid I can't do that.

48:01.420 --> 48:04.047
Laugh all you want,
but Kubrick got it exactly right.

48:04.131 --> 48:06.299
HAL malfunctioned in a very realistic way.

48:06.384 --> 48:07.467
Stop.

48:08.970 --> 48:10.887
Good work tonight.

48:16.310 --> 48:17.477
Hey.

48:23.818 --> 48:25.318
I'm just gonna

48:26.821 --> 48:29.406
go tell her she did a good job.

49:04.984 --> 49:06.443
Brutal.

49:06.861 --> 49:08.695
No words.

49:08.779 --> 49:10.614
I have no words to describe what I just...

49:10.698 --> 49:13.033
- But you're still talking.
- No words.

49:15.286 --> 49:17.203
That's it. That's the last six months.

49:17.371 --> 49:20.373
- Thanks, Brad.
- Could we have the room, please?

49:37.558 --> 49:40.393
Moses and Jesus are playing golf.

49:40.811 --> 49:43.647
Moses steps up to the tee
and hits a beautiful shot,

49:43.731 --> 49:47.734
250 yards straight down
the middle of the fairway.

49:47.818 --> 49:51.529
Jesus steps up to the tee
and hooks the ball into the trees.

49:52.114 --> 49:55.825
Jesus looks up into the heavens,
raises his arms.

49:55.910 --> 49:57.786
Suddenly, the sky darkens.

49:57.870 --> 49:59.829
A thunderclap rings out.

49:59.914 --> 50:03.333
Rain pours down and
a stream rises among the trees.

50:03.459 --> 50:08.338
The golf ball, floating on top,
finds its way into the mouth of a fish.

50:08.464 --> 50:11.007
Then a bird flies down
and takes the fish and the ball

50:11.092 --> 50:15.095
out over the green,
drops it in the cup for a hole in one.

50:16.097 --> 50:19.808
Jesus turns to Moses with a satisfied grin.

50:19.934 --> 50:22.811
And Moses says, "Look,

50:22.895 --> 50:25.480
"you want to play golf
or you want to fuck around?"

50:27.191 --> 50:30.985
What in God's name has happened
to News Night over the last six months?

50:31.070 --> 50:33.279
- Leona...
- Do not laugh.

50:34.615 --> 50:37.492
Leona, the ratings have stabilized.

50:37.576 --> 50:39.369
We're doing a show you can be proud of.

50:39.453 --> 50:41.204
And I'll get them back
to where they used to be.

50:41.288 --> 50:43.998
What happened to human interest stories?

50:44.083 --> 50:46.710
Obesity, breast cancer, hurricanes,

50:46.794 --> 50:48.503
older women having babies, iPhones...

50:48.629 --> 50:50.171
He was great at that shit.

50:50.256 --> 50:51.798
He was sleeping during that shit.

50:51.882 --> 50:53.883
And whose idea was it to wake him up?

50:53.968 --> 50:56.428
- For the third time, it was mine.
- Yeah.

50:56.512 --> 50:59.597
I engineered a situation
wherein an executive producer

50:59.682 --> 51:02.726
with a unique ability to
bring out the very best in an anchor

51:02.810 --> 51:05.395
with a unique ability were paired

51:05.479 --> 51:08.690
to do a news broadcast
this company can and should be proud of.

51:08.774 --> 51:12.026
And rebrand ACN as MSNBC's
more combative brother?

51:12.111 --> 51:13.778
- We did the news.
- For the left.

51:13.863 --> 51:16.781
- For the center.
- Are you fucking out of your mind?

51:16.866 --> 51:19.743
For the center, Leona. Facts are the center.

51:19.827 --> 51:21.995
Facts. We don't pretend that
certain facts are in dispute

51:22.079 --> 51:25.415
to give the appearance of fairness
to people who don't believe them.

51:25.499 --> 51:28.209
Balance is irrelevant to me.

51:28.461 --> 51:32.630
It doesn't have anything to do
with truth, logic, or reality.

51:32.715 --> 51:36.134
He didn't go on the air
telling people to give peace a chance.

51:36.218 --> 51:39.471
But evolution? The jury's back on that one.

51:39.555 --> 51:42.849
He humiliated congressional candidates
on my air.

51:42.933 --> 51:44.976
- It's not your air, Leona.
- Excuse me.

51:45.060 --> 51:46.728
- He needs to continue.
- Listen to me.

51:46.812 --> 51:48.980
Listen to me! America just elected

51:49.064 --> 51:53.109
the most dangerous and
addle-minded Congress in my lifetime.

51:53.194 --> 51:56.196
I have business in front
of this Congress, Charlie!

52:03.704 --> 52:05.955
Reese, why don't you give us a minute?

52:06.040 --> 52:07.248
He can stay.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.751
Reese, get the fuck out.

52:15.716 --> 52:17.383
I'll be right outside.

52:24.767 --> 52:26.351
How would you like me to respond

52:26.435 --> 52:28.812
to your unfiltered contempt for my son?

52:28.896 --> 52:31.314
By telling him to get a paper route.

52:31.398 --> 52:32.398
Look, pal...

52:32.483 --> 52:34.442
What the hell is his job, anyway?

52:34.527 --> 52:35.819
President of this company.

52:35.903 --> 52:37.111
Yeah, I don't know what that means.

52:37.196 --> 52:39.447
It means he's gonna have my job one day.

52:39.532 --> 52:41.783
Please, please let me be dead by then.

52:41.867 --> 52:43.701
I'd be happy to arrange it.

52:43.786 --> 52:47.747
So Will pissed off whoever you were
sitting next to at dinner Saturday night?

52:48.249 --> 52:50.542
I thought you got where you are
by being fearless.

52:50.626 --> 52:55.255
No, I got where I am by knowing who to fear.

52:55.589 --> 52:57.757
And the Koch brothers
are not playing around,

52:57.842 --> 52:59.008
if that's what you're talking about.

52:59.093 --> 53:02.011
They drop Brink's trucks
on people they disagree with.

53:02.346 --> 53:04.389
You and me.

53:04.473 --> 53:06.933
Leona, you can't possibly expect us to tailor

53:07.017 --> 53:10.019
our news coverage to
what best suits our corporate...

53:11.105 --> 53:12.397
Let's start over.

53:12.606 --> 53:15.692
And this time, disabuse yourself of the idea

53:15.776 --> 53:17.861
that this is a conversation between equals,

53:18.195 --> 53:20.864
where I make an argument,
you make a counterargument,

53:20.948 --> 53:22.782
and we agree to disagree.

53:23.117 --> 53:27.120
Our cable news division
accounts for less than 3%

53:27.496 --> 53:29.497
of AWM's annual revenue.

53:29.582 --> 53:31.541
You don't make money for stockholders,

53:31.625 --> 53:35.044
which I have a fiduciary responsibility to do.

53:35.129 --> 53:38.798
Well, last night,
the voters ousted 21% of Congress,

53:38.883 --> 53:41.175
including seven members
of the House Subcommittee

53:41.260 --> 53:42.844
on Communications and Technology.

53:43.137 --> 53:47.557
Three of those seven are AWM's
most reliable friends on the Hill.

53:47.641 --> 53:50.101
Now, the congressmen that
will be replacing them

53:50.185 --> 53:52.562
are the same people that
Will has been making look

53:52.646 --> 53:54.939
like fucking morons for the last six months.

53:55.024 --> 53:57.734
They've done a pretty good job
making themselves look like morons.

53:57.818 --> 54:00.570
I have business before this Congress, Charlie.

54:00.654 --> 54:02.697
And whatever you may think of these people,

54:02.781 --> 54:04.574
which is the same thing I think of them,

54:04.825 --> 54:07.827
they hold the keys to the future of AWM.

54:07.912 --> 54:11.497
Anything more than a pack of gum,
and I have to go to Congress for permission.

54:12.082 --> 54:14.918
I don't make the rules, but I do abide by them.

54:15.002 --> 54:17.503
- News organizations...
- Careful with the lectures.

54:17.588 --> 54:21.341
...are a public trust with an ability to inform

54:21.425 --> 54:24.093
and influence the national conversation.

54:24.178 --> 54:26.679
I know. That's why I bought one.

54:30.935 --> 54:32.936
All right,

54:33.020 --> 54:35.438
they're not candidates anymore.
They are congressmen,

54:35.522 --> 54:36.981
and he is gonna lay off.

54:38.692 --> 54:40.151
He's not gonna lay off anything.

54:40.235 --> 54:42.862
- Oh, yes, he is.
- Let me ask you something.

54:42.947 --> 54:45.448
And don't forget I've known you for 20 years.

54:46.158 --> 54:48.826
If Joe McCarthy sat on
the House Subcommittee

54:48.911 --> 54:50.370
for Communications and Technology,

54:50.454 --> 54:52.121
would you have told Murrow to lay off?

54:52.206 --> 54:54.207
- No.
- Why?

54:54.541 --> 54:56.793
Because he was a genuinely bad guy.

54:56.877 --> 54:59.671
Michele Bachmann's called
for Congress to be investigated

54:59.755 --> 55:02.215
to ferret out House members
who are un-American.

55:02.299 --> 55:03.800
Michele Bachmann is a hairdo.

55:03.884 --> 55:05.802
I'm not worried about Michele Bachmann.

55:05.886 --> 55:08.805
I wonder how many people
weren't worried about McCarthy.

55:10.557 --> 55:14.018
You know, Charlie, a lot of people
might argue that Will is on a witch hunt.

55:14.103 --> 55:17.063
And a lot of people might argue
there are witches out there.

55:19.066 --> 55:20.942
I'll fire him, Charlie.

55:23.362 --> 55:24.570
What?

55:24.697 --> 55:25.947
I'm not asking him to lie.

55:26.031 --> 55:28.199
I'm not asking him to cover anything up.

55:28.283 --> 55:31.995
But he's going to tone it down,
or I'm going to fire him.

55:32.079 --> 55:35.248
Well, best of luck trying
to program against him.

55:35.374 --> 55:38.584
Oh, I don't have to. He's got
a non-compete clause in his contract.

55:38.919 --> 55:41.337
He's gonna have to stay off
television for three years.

55:41.922 --> 55:43.214
That's a death sentence.

55:43.882 --> 55:44.924
It is.

55:45.009 --> 55:47.135
How would you possibly explain firing

55:47.219 --> 55:49.262
the second most-watched anchor on cable?

55:49.930 --> 55:53.016
By creating what we call context.

55:53.100 --> 55:55.351
His firing would be viewed as a noble step

55:55.436 --> 55:59.731
on the part of a corporation
willing to sacrifice ratings for integrity.

55:59.815 --> 56:01.941
You'd manufacture a reason to do it?

56:03.193 --> 56:05.695
I've got a really good job, Charlie.

56:05.779 --> 56:08.573
Now you want to play golf
or you want to fuck around?

56:13.120 --> 56:16.539
Fellas, that was election coverage.
Tell 'em, Charlie.

56:16.790 --> 56:18.124
Where the hell are we?

56:18.542 --> 56:20.960
It's my understanding this is a karaoke bar

56:21.045 --> 56:24.672
with affordable food and drinks
that stays open late

56:24.757 --> 56:27.050
and staffers come here after work to socialize.

56:27.134 --> 56:29.427
When you describe it,
it really sounds like Brigadoon.

56:29.636 --> 56:31.471
- Hey, you know what?
- Shut up?

56:31.555 --> 56:33.264
- Yeah. You know why?
- Where's MacKenzie?

56:33.807 --> 56:36.642
- That's why.
- I didn't meet him until tonight either.

56:37.102 --> 56:38.811
That's all right. I like being here.

56:38.896 --> 56:41.522
Election night. Just the guys.

56:41.607 --> 56:43.566
And... Yeah.

56:44.943 --> 56:46.903
Elliot got in trouble tonight
for saying something

56:46.987 --> 56:49.197
that was worth saying.

56:49.698 --> 56:51.574
Every two years, we drive to a fire station

56:51.658 --> 56:53.618
and overthrow the government

56:53.702 --> 56:55.036
and there isn't a policeman in the street.

56:58.874 --> 57:00.166
I love doing the news.

57:01.585 --> 57:03.211
Hang on.

57:03.504 --> 57:05.546
Who e-mails you at 2:00 a.m. During a toast?

57:05.631 --> 57:08.925
I think whoever it is
probably didn't know about the toast.

57:10.761 --> 57:13.012
Leona Lansing wants to see me at 10:00 a.m.

57:13.097 --> 57:14.680
On the 40th floor conference room.

57:15.390 --> 57:16.557
What do you think it's about?

57:17.184 --> 57:19.685
I think she wants to say good job.

57:20.604 --> 57:22.396
All right, to the 112th Congress.

57:22.940 --> 57:25.274
Godspeed and God bless America.

57:25.818 --> 57:27.443
God bless America.
