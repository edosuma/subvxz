03:42.124 --> 03:44.258
Okay, ladies.

03:49.565 --> 03:52.468
God, this place gives
me the creeps.

03:52.469 --> 03:55.744
- Where is the freakin' thing?
- There.

03:56.538 --> 03:59.674
You've got twenty minutes.
Whatever.

04:13.589 --> 04:15.956
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:17.226 --> 04:18.793
Shit.

04:18.994 --> 04:21.195
Everything okay?

04:23.700 --> 04:26.635
All good. We're coming.

04:51.326 --> 04:52.593
Okay.

04:52.628 --> 04:55.463
Yeah, towards me. Good, got it.

04:55.597 --> 04:58.032
Hold it. Great.

04:58.066 --> 04:59.333
Got it?

05:03.772 --> 05:05.473
All right, I got it.

05:05.874 --> 05:07.808
Easy. Gently.

05:21.857 --> 05:25.760
GRAND PIANO

05:30.465 --> 05:34.736
Please remain in your seats and
keep your seatbelts fastened.

05:34.737 --> 05:36.337
Jesus!

05:36.638 --> 05:39.173
I feel you, kid. Flying?

05:39.241 --> 05:42.510
Flying used to scare the
bejesus out of me too.

05:42.644 --> 05:44.079
Come on. Come on.

05:44.080 --> 05:48.849
I travel a lot and let me tell you, a
beat-up Civic on a bunch of back roads,

05:48.850 --> 05:51.652
it just doesn't cut it anymore.
You know what I mean, right?

05:52.454 --> 05:55.257
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'll be landing

05:55.357 --> 05:57.424
as scheduled in Chicago
O'Hare after all.

05:57.492 --> 05:59.828
- Are we landing?
- Of course we're landing.

05:59.829 --> 06:01.630
These things are built to last.

06:01.631 --> 06:03.597
I'm screwed.

06:04.733 --> 06:06.400
Excuse me?

06:07.202 --> 06:09.271
Well, what did you expect, Tom?

06:09.339 --> 06:11.071
I don't know. Chicago things.

06:11.341 --> 06:15.811
Rain, wind, one of the wings falling off.
Everyone else got diverted.

06:15.812 --> 06:18.445
I know, life just isn't fair.

06:20.382 --> 06:23.450
- Well, your limo could crash.
- You're right. There's still hope.

06:23.752 --> 06:27.556
After all these years maybe the piano's
so out of tune they have to reschedule.

06:27.656 --> 06:29.891
Or I could just take a
blowtorch to the damn thing.

06:29.892 --> 06:32.159
Or you could just cancel.

06:33.328 --> 06:37.065
- Wait. What do you mean, the limo?
- I thought you were picking me up.

06:37.066 --> 06:41.603
No. I'm at the hotel. I still have
the press conference. Remember?

06:41.604 --> 06:45.540
Don't you see a guy with your name
on a thing? I left you a voicemail.

06:45.541 --> 06:48.510
You mean some stranger's picking me up?
What happened to...?

06:48.511 --> 06:51.480
Ashley and Wayne
are meeting me here.

06:51.481 --> 06:54.248
Actually, they're just downstairs.
Are you going to want to say hi?

06:54.249 --> 06:57.818
They probably don't even know
what a classical concert is.

06:58.186 --> 07:01.056
You can explain it to them
yourself when you see them.

07:01.057 --> 07:02.523
Ah, shoot me.

07:03.225 --> 07:06.260
Tell them I said hi,
thanks for coming, all that.

07:06.528 --> 07:09.865
Christ, I doubt they'll be able to
make it through the whole show.

07:09.866 --> 07:11.066
- Come on.
- What?

07:11.067 --> 07:15.604
My agency didn't get them balcony
seats. Ashley's going to flip.

07:16.571 --> 07:18.774
I have to go right now, so just...

07:18.775 --> 07:19.975
No, it's okay. Thanks.

07:19.976 --> 07:21.843
Hold on one second, okay?

07:21.844 --> 07:22.878
Hi!

07:23.311 --> 07:25.113
He wants to talk to you.

07:25.114 --> 07:26.683
Hey! Emma!

07:26.684 --> 07:28.682
Hi. Emma!

07:29.484 --> 07:32.120
Holy crap, girl. You look hot!

07:32.121 --> 07:34.388
Thank you. You look beautiful, too.

07:35.692 --> 07:37.125
Do not put me on
the phone with her.

07:37.126 --> 07:40.294
- It's just for work.
- Oh, fancy.

07:40.697 --> 07:42.963
So what's the deal?
Is he coming here?

07:43.031 --> 07:47.868
Because I know the bartender at
Fridos and it's 50% off top shots.

07:48.103 --> 07:50.971
Tom needs to go straight
to the theater.

07:51.039 --> 07:54.675
- What happened to pre-gaming?
- It's a classical concert, Ash.

07:55.243 --> 07:58.379
So that means it's better
if Tom is not drunk.

07:59.481 --> 08:01.615
We can just post-game. Yeah?

08:01.683 --> 08:03.083
Hang on, just one more second.

08:03.118 --> 08:05.519
I got you something.
I packed it in your carry-on.

08:05.587 --> 08:06.455
What?

08:06.456 --> 08:10.492
It's just a little gift. Welcome
to the twenty-first century.

08:10.493 --> 08:11.093
Tell me again,

08:11.094 --> 08:12.027
why you did all this?

08:12.028 --> 08:14.997
Because it's about time
you got back onstage.

08:14.998 --> 08:16.298
Hold on a sec.

08:27.876 --> 08:29.810
- Hey, are you still there?
- Yeah.

08:29.911 --> 08:32.645
- Are you wearing the tuxedo?
- Should I be?

08:32.714 --> 08:34.581
You're late, Tom.

08:34.883 --> 08:38.152
Just skip the hotel and go
straight to the auditorium, okay?

08:39.321 --> 08:41.221
Are you biting your nails?

08:41.923 --> 08:43.190
No.

08:44.025 --> 08:45.492
I love you.

08:45.527 --> 08:47.027
Love you, too.

09:05.847 --> 09:08.482
Where are we heading to, sir?

09:28.036 --> 09:30.904
- Twenty-first century...
- Sorry, sir?

09:31.606 --> 09:32.806
No...

09:32.841 --> 09:34.341
Sorry.

09:52.127 --> 09:53.727
- Hello?
- Tom Selznick?

09:54.196 --> 09:55.530
- Mark from A&V.
- Hi, Mark.

09:55.531 --> 09:59.835
When Marjorie says: "Tom, what's on
your mind right now?", that's your cue.

09:59.836 --> 10:01.068
- You got it?
- Yeah, I think so.

10:01.069 --> 10:03.337
Good. Okay, stay there.

10:04.072 --> 10:06.774
Three, two, one...

10:07.376 --> 10:11.211
So you're not confirming
any rumors tonight?

10:11.279 --> 10:14.381
Well, I did audition.
I can't say more than that.

10:14.549 --> 10:17.217
Emma Selznick still auditions?

10:17.285 --> 10:19.453
When it comes to musicals, I guess.

10:19.988 --> 10:23.457
So we're going to hear you
sing for the first time, then?

10:23.491 --> 10:26.126
Come on,
I've said too much already.

10:26.228 --> 10:30.030
I sing all the time. At home,
in the shower... Ask my husband!

10:30.298 --> 10:33.734
Well, in fact, we do have
your wonder boy on the other side.

10:34.002 --> 10:37.339
Thanks for your time. It's always a
pleasure to speak with you, Emma.

10:37.340 --> 10:38.006
My pleasure.

10:38.007 --> 10:42.377
Tom Selznick, brightest
piano player of his generation

10:42.378 --> 10:46.147
married to the brightest movie
star of her generation, is back.

10:46.148 --> 10:48.950
It's been five years since
he retired from the stage,

10:48.951 --> 10:52.787
but in a matter of minutes, this
long hiatus will be history.

10:52.788 --> 10:56.758
I must admit I would not like
to be in Tom's shoes tonight.

10:56.759 --> 10:58.859
- Tom, how are you doing?
- Hello?

10:58.927 --> 11:02.997
Tom, what's going through
your head right now?

11:03.065 --> 11:05.199
- Are you nervous?
- What?

11:05.300 --> 11:08.068
Well, you're reuniting
with the F.C.O Philharmonic

11:08.136 --> 11:11.639
to play several notoriously
difficult pieces.

11:11.873 --> 11:14.576
You must have had a couple
of bad nights lately.

11:14.577 --> 11:15.809
No.

11:17.579 --> 11:21.483
Right. And what is the significance of
the piano you'll be playing tonight?

11:21.484 --> 11:23.484
- It's Patrick's piano.
- Right.

11:23.518 --> 11:27.054
I spent months, years,
practicing with him, so...

11:27.122 --> 11:29.356
- Yes.
- It's in his memory that I...

11:29.424 --> 11:32.059
Patrick Godureaux.
Our listeners probably know him

11:32.361 --> 11:36.697
as the eccentric music magnate with
the missing family fortune, but...

11:36.932 --> 11:39.967
Well, to me he was more
than that. He was also a mentor.

11:40.268 --> 11:44.138
What I mean is, what is
the piano's significance to you?

11:44.205 --> 11:47.474
- What do you mean?
- "La Cinquette".

11:47.709 --> 11:50.144
The unplayable piece, right?

11:50.245 --> 11:53.948
"La Cinquette".
Am I mispronouncing it?

11:54.016 --> 11:57.251
I mean, you have a
history with this piece.

11:57.352 --> 11:59.086
Five years ago, at the Flannery...

11:59.154 --> 12:01.390
- That didn't really work out.
- Right.

12:01.391 --> 12:02.957
So my question is this.

12:03.224 --> 12:06.694
You return to the stage after
all these years of silence.

12:06.928 --> 12:09.263
Are you nervous about
playing the same piano?

12:09.364 --> 12:12.299
- Are you nervous about choking again?
- Choking?

12:12.401 --> 12:16.036
Do you see this as your last
chance at glorious redemption,

12:16.104 --> 12:18.872
- your one shot to forever...?
- Stop!

12:20.008 --> 12:22.343
Sorry. Look...

12:23.611 --> 12:24.479
I play piano.

12:24.480 --> 12:27.948
This is just another gig,
nothing else.

12:28.216 --> 12:31.753
Ha-ha. Alright, Mr. Selznick.
That's about all we have time for.

12:31.754 --> 12:33.654
You break a leg!

12:33.922 --> 12:36.223
Oh, shoot me.

12:58.480 --> 13:01.516
Sir, do you think you could pull
it around to the back door?

13:01.517 --> 13:03.617
- Sir.
- Thanks.

13:27.609 --> 13:29.576
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

13:30.012 --> 13:32.579
Excuse me, are you Tom Selznick?

13:32.814 --> 13:33.882
Yeah.

13:33.883 --> 13:35.350
Break a leg!

13:35.351 --> 13:36.617
Thanks.

13:51.933 --> 13:53.433
Selznick!

13:53.501 --> 13:54.969
Welcome back.

13:59.107 --> 14:01.441
Hey, Tommy. Big show.

14:01.509 --> 14:03.710
Thanks. You're looking well.

14:03.711 --> 14:05.646
Yeah. Got divorced!

14:06.714 --> 14:08.315
Tom! You're alive!

14:08.383 --> 14:10.917
What, you miss the cold sweat?

14:11.152 --> 14:13.153
Hey, do you know where Norman is?

14:13.455 --> 14:17.457
Yeah, just head down here, turn left.
He's stuck to the catering.

14:17.559 --> 14:19.627
He quit smoking again?

14:19.794 --> 14:23.097
Kind of. But don't talk to him
about it, trust me.

14:23.098 --> 14:25.465
Hey! Break a leg!

14:38.847 --> 14:39.982
Sir!

14:39.983 --> 14:41.082
Your chart.

14:41.083 --> 14:45.487
And may I just add how exciting
it is to have you back on-stage.

14:45.488 --> 14:46.387
Tommy!

14:46.388 --> 14:47.554
Thank you.

14:47.956 --> 14:49.222
Come here!

14:49.257 --> 14:51.858
- How's the great Tom Selznick?
- Hey, Norman.

14:51.926 --> 14:54.161
Are you okay? How was your flight?

14:54.329 --> 14:56.163
Oh, my God, who dressed you?

14:56.431 --> 14:59.199
- Thank god you landed on time.
- Yeah, thank God.

15:00.535 --> 15:03.338
- Oh, is it...?
- No. Not a scratch. It's perfect.

15:03.339 --> 15:06.106
Well, that's a relief.
Did you check it out?

15:06.307 --> 15:09.109
- Lower C natural is a little sharp.
- It always was.

15:09.344 --> 15:11.578
Other than that, she's beautiful.
It's a shame we can't keep her.

15:11.846 --> 15:16.149
Frank, you've gotta take first part
tonight, Carl's sick. Not a problem, right?

15:20.288 --> 15:22.255
Who are those guys? CIA?

15:22.524 --> 15:25.258
Nothing that interesting.
Insurance guys. Very serious.

15:25.527 --> 15:27.929
Patrick loved that piano more
than he loved his own family.

15:27.930 --> 15:28.897
Clearly.

15:28.898 --> 15:30.331
Assholes!

15:32.300 --> 15:33.734
Very funny.

15:34.269 --> 15:36.069
Seriously. Assholes.

15:36.137 --> 15:38.872
Even in five years,
haven't you forgot?

15:39.841 --> 15:40.707
I'm fine.

15:40.808 --> 15:41.776
Are you sure?

15:41.777 --> 15:46.048
Because that kind of put me in the
mood to make some heads roll.

15:46.049 --> 15:47.848
Really. I'm fine.

15:51.352 --> 15:52.686
Jesus, look at Patrick!

15:53.087 --> 15:56.090
Jesus, Patrick, you're terrifying.

15:56.091 --> 15:57.724
He still scares me.

15:57.926 --> 16:00.026
Did you hear about the
whole fortune thing?

16:00.094 --> 16:03.597
I swear to God he thought
he was Charles Foster Kane.

16:03.898 --> 16:07.901
Do you really think he'd want me
playing his precious piano again?

16:08.536 --> 16:10.638
The great screw-up?

16:11.073 --> 16:12.339
What?

16:12.507 --> 16:16.010
Patrick. He'd be embarrassed.

16:17.079 --> 16:20.247
- Tom...
- Come on, I always flubbed notes.

16:20.481 --> 16:24.518
Tom Selznick, the new Rachmaninoff...
if only he didn't choke.

16:24.586 --> 16:27.320
Tommy, listen to me.

16:28.189 --> 16:30.690
- Patrick would be proud of you.
- No.

16:30.758 --> 16:32.160
I'm gonna screw up, Norman.
I know it.

16:32.161 --> 16:37.097
You can't play charts like these without
fudging a note here and there. So what?

16:37.465 --> 16:40.701
If you're going to start playing carefully,
I'll just go get the wine and cheese.

16:40.702 --> 16:43.904
Do you want to be the thousandth
guy to give me a respectable Bach?

16:44.038 --> 16:46.674
Because you can keep that.
I don't need respectable.

16:46.975 --> 16:50.044
If you're going to play music this
dense, you're going to hit a wrong note.

16:50.045 --> 16:51.878
And they won't know.

16:52.313 --> 16:54.114
They never do.

16:55.984 --> 16:59.687
And you know what? I've never
seen so many people this excited.

16:59.787 --> 17:01.256
They've waited for
this for five years.

17:01.257 --> 17:02.757
I could have waited another five.

17:02.758 --> 17:03.691
Really?

17:03.692 --> 17:08.095
I have never in my life met another
human being so perfectly shaped

17:08.096 --> 17:10.130
for one purpose.

17:13.468 --> 17:15.068
Do what you do.

17:15.637 --> 17:17.804
And try and have some fun.

17:18.673 --> 17:20.406
And remember...

17:22.343 --> 17:24.345
It's just music.

17:25.445 --> 17:27.127
Ladies and gentlemen,

17:27.415 --> 17:31.218
the main entrance doors
are about to be closed.

17:33.488 --> 17:35.589
Ashley! Wayne!

17:37.091 --> 17:39.292
Hey, you guys!
I thought I'd lost you.

17:39.360 --> 17:42.662
I'm sorry, honey. We were at
the bar. It was Happy Hour.

17:42.730 --> 17:45.031
I called you six times.

17:45.133 --> 17:48.935
- Oh my God. Wayne, where is my phone?
- Yeah, it's right here.

17:49.003 --> 17:51.306
- We should get going.
- Yeah, 6 missed calls.

17:51.307 --> 17:53.173
Yeah? Yeah, you think?

17:53.241 --> 17:54.908
Pay more attention. Okay, honey?

17:55.009 --> 17:56.444
We really should get in there.

17:56.445 --> 17:59.145
Emma, calm down.
Just can just slip in.

17:59.213 --> 18:02.082
What a guy doesn't
know doesn't hurt him.

18:02.183 --> 18:05.286
Here are your tickets. I'll meet
you guys right after, okay?

18:05.354 --> 18:08.256
Wait. Are we not sitting with you?

18:08.257 --> 18:10.390
Oh, God... No.

18:10.458 --> 18:13.460
They really need me to sit
in this one particular place.

18:13.729 --> 18:16.129
But I got you really good seats,
they're in the orchestra.

18:16.130 --> 18:18.431
So we're not sitting with you?

18:19.167 --> 18:23.570
But I'm going to meet you right after.
Ashley, I'm so glad you could come.

18:23.838 --> 18:27.942
It's our pleasure. I mean, you're the
closest Wayne gets to a celebrity.

18:28.509 --> 18:29.477
Let's go.

18:29.478 --> 18:32.879
Okay. Enjoy the show.
I'll see you guys after.

18:32.914 --> 18:35.882
Well, that was embarrassing.

18:35.950 --> 18:36.751
Come on, doofus.

18:36.752 --> 18:41.488
I don't know what all the rushing
is about. Don't they have an opening act?

19:09.418 --> 19:11.384
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:11.486 --> 19:13.988
the show will start
in five minutes.

19:14.056 --> 19:16.556
Please, silence your phones.

19:16.924 --> 19:18.692
Mission accomplished.

19:22.330 --> 19:26.366
I knew it! Look, there are
plenty of seats up there.

19:27.301 --> 19:30.638
Hey, boys and girls, come on!
It's five minutes!

19:30.872 --> 19:34.307
Get your weapons ready.
Let's go! Yeah, yeah, come on!

19:36.144 --> 19:37.777
Lynn, sorry!

19:59.233 --> 20:00.967
Can you hear me?

20:01.135 --> 20:03.903
Okay, yeah...

20:04.238 --> 20:05.772
One second...

20:05.973 --> 20:08.708
And... we're in.

20:53.821 --> 20:56.222
Ladies and gentlemen,

20:56.290 --> 21:00.394
introducing tonight's conductor,
Mr. Norman Reisinger.

21:23.417 --> 21:24.684
Sir.

21:24.852 --> 21:27.120
- Your score.
- What?

21:27.688 --> 21:30.090
You left it in the dressing room.

21:30.925 --> 21:33.794
Thanks. You just saved my life.

21:33.795 --> 21:35.562
Anything you need.

21:37.164 --> 21:38.498
Congratulations.

21:38.599 --> 21:40.935
The whole place is packed.

21:45.107 --> 21:47.774
Thought you would
like to hear that.

22:20.007 --> 22:21.642
Ladies and gentlemen...

22:21.643 --> 22:23.143
Shit.

22:23.544 --> 22:25.111
Tom Selznick.

25:36.504 --> 25:38.404
Assholes.

25:50.684 --> 25:53.419
I think he's looking at you.

27:16.937 --> 27:18.338
No, I have to go.

29:15.923 --> 29:17.357
What?

29:21.796 --> 29:23.062
No!

29:40.981 --> 29:43.951
Get back on-stage.

29:43.952 --> 29:45.351
Who is this?

29:45.419 --> 29:47.987
I'm Patrick Godureaux.

29:48.922 --> 29:51.391
Got your attention? Good.

29:51.959 --> 29:55.161
Now get back on stage,
your audience is getting antsy.

29:55.463 --> 29:58.364
- You think I don't know what you're up to?
- What am I up to?

29:58.432 --> 30:01.500
- Did Norman put you up to this?
- Norman? I don't follow.

30:01.635 --> 30:04.170
Look, I get it. It's funny.

30:04.438 --> 30:08.009
The stage-fright guy. You send him messages
because you think he's wetting his pants.

30:08.010 --> 30:09.575
- Are you?
- No.

30:09.676 --> 30:11.811
Would you like me to change that?

30:12.046 --> 30:15.048
- Listen to me!
- Are you sure this is a prank?

30:15.282 --> 30:18.517
Let's have a bet. I'll bet it's
not a prank. You bet it is.

30:18.786 --> 30:23.356
If I win, I get to spray Emma Selznick's
brains all over her Gucci purse.

30:23.424 --> 30:25.825
If you win, you get to tell me off.

30:25.893 --> 30:28.160
Come on, this'll be a fun bet.
Let's do it.

30:28.429 --> 30:30.949
- I'm calling the cops.
- My friend is outside the theater.

30:31.031 --> 30:33.666
He sees so much as one cop
car pull into the lot

30:33.768 --> 30:37.536
and the ushers will have a corpse
to clean up in box seat five.

30:37.604 --> 30:40.908
Now head to the left side
of the stage. Now.

30:59.660 --> 31:01.560
In front of you.

31:02.129 --> 31:03.796
The top step.

31:04.165 --> 31:05.798
I see it.

31:05.966 --> 31:07.667
Look closely.

31:10.404 --> 31:12.571
Keep looking.

31:14.641 --> 31:16.542
That's the entry wound
of a Rochester .47

31:16.610 --> 31:19.779
automatic with scope
laser aim and silencer.

31:19.880 --> 31:23.883
The most precise weapon on
the market. And the quietest.

31:23.984 --> 31:26.419
Now you know the meaning
of "stage-fright".

31:26.487 --> 31:29.155
Get on-stage or it's Emma's head.

31:32.759 --> 31:36.095
Does this mean we have
an understanding? Say it.

31:36.163 --> 31:38.931
Quietly. They'll just think
you're talking to yourself.

31:38.999 --> 31:42.669
Another 'tee-ta-taa',
or whatever the hell you do.

31:45.072 --> 31:48.974
Okay. Here are the rules. I can
see and hear everything you do.

31:49.209 --> 31:51.477
Call for help and I will hear it.

31:51.945 --> 31:54.213
Leave the stage and I will see it.

31:54.448 --> 31:57.216
Get a cop or a guard involved,
I will know it.

31:57.718 --> 32:00.419
If you do any of these things,
your wife will die.

32:00.721 --> 32:05.058
If you play a wrong note, you will no longer
be of any use to me and you will die.

32:05.126 --> 32:08.894
That's two people I can kill
when and if I feel like it.

32:08.996 --> 32:12.966
So I'm hoping that's double the
chance you'll do what I say.

32:13.467 --> 32:15.201
Do you see me?

32:19.973 --> 32:23.442
- How are you talking to me?
- Look at the keys.

32:23.644 --> 32:26.011
Your entrance is in two bars.

32:26.079 --> 32:30.350
Come in late and it'll be the
last downbeat you ever play.

32:38.692 --> 32:40.960
- Now you can talk.
- Where are you?

32:41.062 --> 32:44.029
In a solo box seat. I have privacy
here. A great view, too.

32:44.097 --> 32:45.977
- How are you talking to me?
- I'm high up.

32:46.067 --> 32:49.602
Not only can I see everything you do,
I can see everything Emma does.

32:49.670 --> 32:51.738
Right now she's yawning.
I think she's bored.

32:51.806 --> 32:53.939
This isn't really her
type of music, is it?

32:54.041 --> 32:56.201
- Does that upset you?
- What do you want from me?

32:56.243 --> 32:58.811
I want you to keep your voice down.

32:59.646 --> 33:02.715
We wouldn't want the audience
getting the wrong idea.

33:03.084 --> 33:06.085
But something tells me
this time you won't.

33:06.454 --> 33:09.389
- I'll give you all the money I have.
- I don't want your money.

33:09.390 --> 33:11.056
Then what?

33:12.159 --> 33:15.795
I want you to play the most
flawless concert of your life.

33:16.363 --> 33:20.667
Consider me the voice in your head telling
you that good is not good enough tonight.

33:20.701 --> 33:23.702
Okay. Fine. We can do this.

33:23.870 --> 33:25.871
But you don't need Emma.

33:26.139 --> 33:27.407
There, it's done.

33:27.408 --> 33:30.075
- What's done?
- What you asked.

33:32.145 --> 33:36.115
You made a good point, she was
muddling things, so I shot her.

33:38.285 --> 33:42.254
Not sure if you believe me or
you saw how quiet I can be.

33:42.322 --> 33:44.223
And your lovely wife
could've just slumped over

33:44.224 --> 33:47.726
and fallen asleep,
she was so goddamned bored.

33:48.763 --> 33:51.698
Isn't it amazing what you can get
away with in a crowded theater

33:51.732 --> 33:54.433
when all eyes are on the stage?

33:56.937 --> 33:59.939
Sit down or I really
will shoot her.

34:01.642 --> 34:04.677
Come on.
Isn't this what you wanted?

34:04.945 --> 34:09.315
You said yourself she was a muddler.
Muddling your whole life, it seems.

34:09.516 --> 34:12.485
- You don't know anything.
- But I do, Tom.

34:12.853 --> 34:17.922
She might get more magazine covers than
you, but you are a person of note.

34:18.292 --> 34:22.561
She won't be in the
history books. You will.

34:25.498 --> 34:27.867
Because you're a person of note.

34:27.967 --> 34:29.935
I know everything
I need to know about you.

34:30.237 --> 34:34.340
I know where you leave your phone.
I know you mutter when you play.

34:34.474 --> 34:38.878
I know you have the fastest, most
agile fingers of any pianist alive.

34:39.246 --> 34:42.915
And you know what's funny? She'd throw
it all away, the fame and the money,

34:42.983 --> 34:45.583
for just a tenth of your talent.

34:45.820 --> 34:49.355
Please, let her go.
I'll do what you want.

34:49.422 --> 34:53.592
You think you can bargain with me?
You're not in control, Tom.

34:53.594 --> 34:56.029
The audience is in control.

34:56.097 --> 35:00.099
And right now, I'm your audience.

35:17.517 --> 35:18.784
Thank you.

35:19.619 --> 35:20.920
Thank you.

35:20.987 --> 35:22.322
Thank you.

35:24.891 --> 35:25.925
Thank you.

35:26.927 --> 35:31.030
I know that it's not customary
to speak between movements,

35:31.098 --> 35:34.233
but please understand
that, as a conductor,

35:34.334 --> 35:38.237
I sometimes just need to hear
the sound of my own voice.

35:40.474 --> 35:43.609
Tonight we're offering you one of
Patrick Godureaux's favorite pieces:

35:43.677 --> 35:46.445
Stephan Yeranosian's
Piano Concerto No. 4,

35:46.513 --> 35:49.548
which is the perfect vehicle
for reuniting all of us

35:49.616 --> 35:52.486
with one of the world's
greatest living pianists...

35:52.487 --> 35:53.253
Wake up, Tom.

35:53.254 --> 35:55.655
...whose genius wowed
Godureaux himself.

35:55.656 --> 35:59.326
The one and only Tom Selznick.

36:05.532 --> 36:08.769
I almost forgot! I'm sorry, Tom,
I'll get back to you in a second.

36:08.770 --> 36:11.371
As if this venue
weren't unique enough,

36:11.471 --> 36:15.307
let me tell you something about
the piano that Tom is playing.

36:15.409 --> 36:17.910
This customized
Imperial Boesenndorfer

36:18.178 --> 36:22.181
with eight full octaves
belonged to Patrick himself.

36:22.716 --> 36:27.252
This is the first time this piano
has been on a stage anywhere.

36:27.354 --> 36:28.688
Sadly, we don't get to keep it.

36:28.689 --> 36:33.260
Tonight when we're finished, this piano
is on an 11 PM plane to Switzerland,

36:33.261 --> 36:35.829
which is probably not what the
board of directors thought I meant

36:35.830 --> 36:40.099
when I assured them that tonight they
would see this instrument take flight.

36:43.069 --> 36:47.906
Patrick's passing this last
year was a blow to all of us.

36:48.642 --> 36:53.345
I would therefore like to dedicate this
evening's performance to his memory.

36:53.513 --> 36:56.583
I would also like to thank
the lovely Emma Selznick...

36:57.151 --> 36:59.652
for helping bring
everything together.

37:04.492 --> 37:07.292
I'm sure they could have
had room for us up there.

37:07.360 --> 37:09.628
And to really showcase what
this instrument can do,

37:09.696 --> 37:13.967
tonight Tom will be finishing the
evening, sans orchestra, with...

37:14.201 --> 37:19.104
No, not that infamous piece. I think
we've all heard enough about that.

37:19.272 --> 37:22.709
With Beethoven's "Tempest" Sonata.

37:22.909 --> 37:25.444
One of Patrick's favorites

37:25.745 --> 37:26.781
But first things first.

37:26.782 --> 37:32.885
Ladies and gentleman, the second movement
of Yeranosian's Piano Concerto No. 4.

37:37.591 --> 37:39.491
What are you waiting for?

38:30.243 --> 38:32.845
Are you there? I want to talk.

38:32.913 --> 38:35.581
I'd rather you play than talk, Tom.

38:57.405 --> 39:00.305
Are you freaking kidding me?

39:00.340 --> 39:01.907
I'm looking for it, Ash...

39:01.975 --> 39:05.043
Everyone is looking at us.
Turn it off.

39:05.146 --> 39:06.912
Hurry up.

39:08.281 --> 39:09.815
Hello?

39:10.617 --> 39:11.985
What?

39:12.352 --> 39:14.319
Wayne, I swear to God...

39:19.125 --> 39:20.392
Tom?

39:20.428 --> 39:22.729
Turn the damn thing off!

39:22.896 --> 39:24.030
Tom?

39:24.031 --> 39:25.066
Can you hear me, Tom?

39:25.067 --> 39:28.400
I wanna know why you've got
a gun pointed at Emma.

39:30.136 --> 39:31.271
Let me see who called.

39:31.272 --> 39:35.642
I apologize. I know you'd rather
have everything only pointed at you.

39:54.227 --> 39:58.197
You're doing an excellent job.
Soon you'll be ready for what's next.

39:58.531 --> 40:02.936
- What? What's next?
- You'll find out. Be patient.

40:02.937 --> 40:04.270
It's obviously Emma.

40:04.271 --> 40:06.238
Probably by mistake.

40:09.376 --> 40:10.677
No, it was a man's voice.

40:10.678 --> 40:15.048
Tom is on the stage playing the piano.
There is no way he called you.

40:15.049 --> 40:16.715
He's saying something.
He's talking.

40:16.716 --> 40:20.021
He is not talking, he's counting.

40:20.022 --> 40:22.087
It's what musicians do.

40:22.288 --> 40:25.123
Shush! I'm trying
to listen to the music.

40:25.959 --> 40:27.793
Excuse me!

40:28.361 --> 40:30.964
You do not shush me.

40:31.064 --> 40:33.498
- I've got to go to the bathroom.
- Wayne!

40:57.323 --> 40:59.391
What was that, Tom?

40:59.459 --> 41:01.927
- What the hell was that?
- My watch.

41:02.028 --> 41:05.197
Your watch? What about it?

41:05.899 --> 41:07.199
An alarm.

41:09.569 --> 41:14.340
An alarm? You expect me to believe you'd
let your alarm go off during a show?

41:14.341 --> 41:17.109
- It was a mistake.
- A mistake?

41:17.177 --> 41:18.446
It's been 5 years.
I forgot to turn it off.

41:18.447 --> 41:19.978
I hope you're telling the truth.

41:20.081 --> 41:21.147
Tom? Hello?

41:21.148 --> 41:24.117
Don't open your mouth
again unless it's to count.

41:24.118 --> 41:25.051
Hi, Tom.

41:25.052 --> 41:29.022
I just got a call from
you and... I mean...

41:29.122 --> 41:30.803
Aren't you on stage right now?

41:30.857 --> 41:32.491
Stop fidgeting, Tom.

41:32.727 --> 41:37.896
Anyway, I heard something
kind of odd and I...

41:39.532 --> 41:41.133
I'm going to try you again.

41:55.715 --> 41:57.249
What are you doing?

41:58.685 --> 42:00.452
Stop playing with your music.

42:08.428 --> 42:09.728
Wayne!

42:09.764 --> 42:10.963
Come back here!

42:10.964 --> 42:12.230
Wayne!

42:18.805 --> 42:20.340
Oh, my God.

43:13.828 --> 43:15.360
Excuse me!

43:15.428 --> 43:16.928
May I help you?

43:16.996 --> 43:18.697
- Do you work here?
- Yeah.

43:19.666 --> 43:23.168
- There's a situation.
- A situation?

43:25.638 --> 43:28.540
I got this from the man on stage.

43:30.510 --> 43:35.414
- If this is a joke, it's not funny.
- I swear it's not. Not from me.

43:36.282 --> 43:39.317
Come with me now.
We'll talk to security.

43:40.086 --> 43:43.155
It's probably a prank.
But you never know.

44:03.576 --> 44:07.946
Tom, I have a surprise for you.
Look above your head.

44:08.348 --> 44:09.614
Watch carefully.

44:14.521 --> 44:16.988
I want you to see this.

44:24.931 --> 44:26.098
No!

44:26.199 --> 44:28.467
Keep it together.
Keep playing, Tom.

44:28.501 --> 44:31.370
If you don't pull it together
in one second, you'll be shot.

44:31.471 --> 44:33.952
Keep your fingers on the piano
and your mind on the music.

44:34.073 --> 44:37.009
This will teach you
how to focus. Steady!

44:39.913 --> 44:40.980
Good.

44:40.981 --> 44:46.585
Now make your conductor think
everything's okay or he'll be next.

44:52.125 --> 44:53.827
Tom? Feeling better?

44:53.828 --> 44:56.294
Why? Why did you kill him??

44:56.362 --> 44:58.403
You've never seen a dead
body before, have you?

44:58.665 --> 45:02.134
How did you think you could be a great
artist with so little life experience?

45:02.402 --> 45:06.439
I've taught you in a way Patrick never
could, which means you're ready.

45:06.440 --> 45:07.806
What?

45:07.874 --> 45:09.941
"La Cinquette".

45:10.477 --> 45:12.377
Remember it?

45:12.479 --> 45:13.246
What about it?

45:13.247 --> 45:19.119
"The Unplayable Piece". Except there's a
few people who can play it. Am I right?

45:19.120 --> 45:22.689
Who can move their fingers that
fast and spread them that wide.

45:22.690 --> 45:25.425
One of them died last summer.
The other is you.

45:25.426 --> 45:27.860
No. I can't play it.
It's been five years.

45:27.861 --> 45:30.463
Well, here's your chance to
put the meltdown behind you.

45:30.464 --> 45:34.200
Here's your chance to show all of those
who laughed at you, who pitied you,

45:34.201 --> 45:35.168
what you're really capable of.

45:35.169 --> 45:38.170
Listen to me. You don't understand.
I can't play it.

45:38.171 --> 45:40.172
Why? Because you froze?

45:40.440 --> 45:43.542
Because you've never been as terrified
as you were that night on stage?

45:43.810 --> 45:47.379
Because those last four bars have haunted
you every day of your life since?

45:47.480 --> 45:48.514
I don't know it by heart.

45:48.515 --> 45:51.850
Which is why I had my assistant
put it in your folder.

45:51.884 --> 45:55.854
I've planned this well, Tom.
I have faith in you.

45:57.290 --> 46:01.059
More than it seems Emma ever did.

46:01.294 --> 46:04.062
Holding your hand, orchestrating
your return to the stage

46:04.297 --> 46:07.832
just so she doesn't feel so bad about
hogging the spotlight from you.

46:07.900 --> 46:11.436
Admit it. You're bitter
she's become a success.

46:13.440 --> 46:16.942
And all I'm doing is offering you a
chance to become your own man again.

46:18.911 --> 46:22.714
In time, you'll learn to be grateful.
But for now, focus on this.

46:22.816 --> 46:24.983
The final four bars
of "La Cinquette".

46:25.051 --> 46:27.987
Play them to perfection for
the first time in your life

46:27.988 --> 46:30.090
and you walk out of here alive.

46:30.091 --> 46:31.623
"La Cinquette".

46:32.225 --> 46:36.094
- I threw it out before the show.
- That was a stupid thing to do.

46:36.329 --> 46:39.130
- Play it by memory then.
- You know I can't.

46:39.365 --> 46:42.686
That's why you stuck it in there. That's
why you needed me to have sheet music.

46:42.769 --> 46:45.105
Too bad for Emma. You'll be
better off without her anyway.

46:45.106 --> 46:48.407
No! You don't have another copy?

46:48.508 --> 46:50.642
Why should I?
That's why I've got you.

46:50.710 --> 46:52.978
Wait! I remember, the janitor...

46:53.046 --> 46:55.213
He saw me throw it to
the ground. He must have it.

46:55.448 --> 46:58.583
In that case, he's about to throw
"La Cinquette" into the trash.

46:58.651 --> 47:02.153
- Can't you pick it up?
- Trust me, you want me up here.

47:02.722 --> 47:05.424
What about someone else?
Maybe your assistant?

47:05.492 --> 47:07.259
I believe he's busy.

47:25.278 --> 47:29.182
When it's intermission, get the score.
And try not to get any more people killed.

47:43.663 --> 47:44.929
Wayne?

47:53.807 --> 47:55.173
Wayne?

47:59.979 --> 48:01.513
Oh, my God!

48:01.681 --> 48:02.415
I'm sorry.

48:02.416 --> 48:05.819
It's okay. I get confused
all the time around here.

48:05.820 --> 48:07.386
- I'll get it.
- Don't worry.

48:56.636 --> 48:58.603
What are you waiting for?

49:03.876 --> 49:06.245
- Where am I going?
- The stairs.

49:06.246 --> 49:08.246
Turn left at the bottom.

49:09.448 --> 49:12.117
Tom, the stairs.

49:16.222 --> 49:17.689
Three doors down.

49:17.723 --> 49:20.458
What? Where?

49:21.093 --> 49:22.894
Left and left.

49:35.241 --> 49:37.876
Excuse me! Sir! Wait!

49:37.944 --> 49:40.945
Wait! No, don't! No! No! No!

49:43.416 --> 49:45.452
Hey, what is wrong?

49:45.453 --> 49:47.019
What is wrong?

49:47.086 --> 49:49.488
- He threw the score out.
- That's a shame.

49:49.489 --> 49:51.890
Wait! I have a copy at home.

49:51.958 --> 49:54.159
I could get someone to go get it.

49:54.260 --> 49:56.995
- I think you know what this means.
- Wait!

50:00.333 --> 50:02.300
Wait. I have an idea.

50:11.444 --> 50:15.914
- Is there a problem?
- It's fine, I'll be right back, I promise.

50:16.015 --> 50:17.549
Back him up.

50:20.386 --> 50:23.655
Can you hear me?
Where the hell are you?

50:23.656 --> 50:25.857
Are you speaking with
me or to the kid?

50:25.925 --> 50:28.126
- Go straight to his dressing room.
- What?

50:28.227 --> 50:31.597
Go to his dressing room and
don't let him out of your sight.

50:31.598 --> 50:33.065
On my way.

50:38.170 --> 50:41.306
I love your dress. You're shiny.

50:42.475 --> 50:44.676
Emma? Over here.

50:49.482 --> 50:51.583
Excuse me. Thank you.

50:53.953 --> 50:56.154
I hope you're enjoying it.

50:56.722 --> 50:59.624
Emma, a picture of
you and me, please.

51:40.232 --> 51:43.001
Do you have him?
Don't tell me you've lost him.

51:43.103 --> 51:45.303
No. I've got him.

51:45.604 --> 51:48.606
- Careful. Emma's leaving the theater.
- And?

51:48.674 --> 51:51.509
- Follow her.
- I can't be in two places at once.

52:09.595 --> 52:12.498
So, what do you want me to do?

52:12.499 --> 52:13.998
Go for her.

52:14.633 --> 52:16.435
"Go for her."

52:17.169 --> 52:21.506
Your wish is my command... Asshole.

52:24.877 --> 52:27.545
Mrs. Selznick! Mrs. Selznick...

52:29.648 --> 52:31.350
Go ask her.

52:32.017 --> 52:34.919
Can I take a picture with you?

52:44.563 --> 52:46.431
Ladies and gentlemen,

52:46.632 --> 52:49.735
please do make sure your
cell phones are on silent.

52:51.805 --> 52:56.274
Ladies and gentlemen, please
do make sure your cell phones

52:56.342 --> 52:58.076
are on silent.

53:02.581 --> 53:03.915
Honey?

53:04.917 --> 53:05.851
Emma!

53:05.852 --> 53:09.422
I hope we're not interrupting,
Mr. Selznick. She insisted.

53:09.423 --> 53:11.424
- I don't mean to be a problem.
- Oh, no.

53:11.425 --> 53:14.292
Not every day I've got two
celebrities to take care of.

53:14.828 --> 53:17.261
He's such a lifesaver for
bringing me down here.

53:17.329 --> 53:17.963
She's something.

53:17.964 --> 53:22.201
I just wanted to come and say
what a great job you're doing.

53:22.202 --> 53:24.902
Really, you're playing
so beautifully.

53:34.613 --> 53:36.881
Ladies and gentlemen...

53:37.149 --> 53:38.684
We should go.

53:38.984 --> 53:41.953
We should probably leave you alone.

53:43.722 --> 53:45.757
I love you, honey.

53:46.926 --> 53:50.094
See you on-stage, Mr. Selznick.

53:50.830 --> 53:52.064
Let me get that for you.

53:52.065 --> 53:56.134
...tonight's performance
will resume in five minutes.

53:56.569 --> 54:03.107
We kindly ask you to make your way
back to your seats at this time.

54:08.047 --> 54:10.114
Thank you so much.

54:12.318 --> 54:14.552
That was close.

54:16.055 --> 54:17.522
You're welcome.

54:17.857 --> 54:19.291
Anyway, it's going to shit.

54:19.292 --> 54:23.494
Calm down. That's what they always
say during any creative endeavor:

54:23.562 --> 54:25.596
it's all going to shit.

54:25.664 --> 54:27.432
All the people of note.

54:27.500 --> 54:30.802
Look, I'm tired of the
"people of note" crap.

54:30.870 --> 54:33.973
- You want to know what I think?
- Enlighten me, please.

54:35.641 --> 54:37.608
- Hello?
- Yes?

54:38.445 --> 54:42.146
- Are you even there, man?
- I'm listening, avidly.

54:42.548 --> 54:45.083
What I'm saying is you
could've made this easy.

54:45.150 --> 54:48.786
Blackmail the movers. Have
them take a detour somewhere

54:48.888 --> 54:50.788
and have the piano all to yourself.

54:50.890 --> 54:54.592
But no, instead we got a
night of fucking Goodereks.

54:54.994 --> 54:56.228
And what would you have suggested,

54:56.229 --> 54:59.865
kidnap the wonder-boy and drag him to
a warehouse with a gun to his head?

54:59.866 --> 55:01.999
No, not necessarily. I mean...

55:02.034 --> 55:06.772
Or build a robot that can play "La
Cinquette" like Rockafire Explosion?

55:06.872 --> 55:09.109
Your ideas are brilliant.
Keep 'em coming.

55:09.110 --> 55:11.043
Look, man, all I'm saying is...

55:11.111 --> 55:13.870
Nobody in his right mind would try
pulling off a heist like this.

55:13.946 --> 55:16.949
That's what you're saying,
am I right?

55:16.950 --> 55:17.516
Because...

55:17.517 --> 55:21.720
that is how you make history.
That's how you get into the record books.

55:21.721 --> 55:25.057
Four bars of "La Cinquette", you won't
have to answer to anybody ever again.

55:26.325 --> 55:28.227
Just do your job!

55:55.254 --> 55:57.388
Were you eavesdropping, Tom?

56:04.630 --> 56:06.330
Fair enough.

56:07.099 --> 56:11.136
Tell me something. What did
Patrick love more than anything?

56:11.137 --> 56:11.937
His body of work?

56:11.938 --> 56:16.742
His body of work, yeah, that's funny.
Certainly not his family.

56:16.743 --> 56:19.211
- But you're missing something.
- What do you mean?

56:19.212 --> 56:22.082
How many keys does
Patrick's piano have?

56:22.083 --> 56:23.148
What?

56:23.149 --> 56:25.350
Answer the question.

56:25.351 --> 56:27.485
- Ninety-seven.
- Wrong.

56:29.355 --> 56:30.955
No, it's right.

56:31.191 --> 56:34.625
Full eight octaves, seven white
keys and five black keys.

56:34.693 --> 56:37.562
Plus the extra lower keys.
It's ninety-seven.

56:37.863 --> 56:41.666
You're missing a key. And you know
what happens when you miss a key.

56:41.700 --> 56:44.001
- I know I'm right. Do the math.
- I did.

56:44.104 --> 56:47.638
I know that piano better than
anyone who's ever played it.

56:48.173 --> 56:52.510
The last four bars of "The
Unplayable Piece", that's your key.

56:52.778 --> 56:55.279
- Who the hell are you?
- No-one compared to you and Patrick.

56:55.280 --> 57:00.052
The only thing Emma would find more
boring than your music is what I do.

57:01.687 --> 57:04.690
It's not the Berlin
Philharmonic, but it's a job.

57:04.957 --> 57:08.359
Say an old man sends a fortune
to a Swiss bank, stashes it

57:08.460 --> 57:12.163
in a safe and hides a key somewhere
only he could ever access.

57:12.231 --> 57:16.734
The kind of lock that only someone
with his skills could ever open.

57:17.102 --> 57:18.903
I helped Patrick build that lock

57:18.971 --> 57:21.906
and those fingers of yours
are going to get it open.

57:21.974 --> 57:24.476
Now's when you ask me: "How much?"

57:24.477 --> 57:26.477
- I don't care.
- You sure?

57:27.046 --> 57:30.516
Aren't you curious as to
the price of your life?

57:30.517 --> 57:33.484
How much money justifies all this?

57:34.019 --> 57:34.987
Nothing.

57:34.988 --> 57:38.556
I wouldn't do what you're doing
for all the money in the world.

57:39.958 --> 57:43.060
Stravinsky beat his own
children, Mozart was a drunk,

57:43.163 --> 57:45.364
but you're better than them.
Is that it?

57:45.432 --> 57:48.065
No, I don't care.
It wouldn't matter.

57:48.168 --> 57:50.635
I think the mark of a
great artist is curiosity.

57:50.903 --> 57:54.972
You're striking me as a mediocre artist.
Don't you know everybody has a price?

57:55.040 --> 57:57.174
- What's yours?
- Imagine it.

57:57.376 --> 57:59.011
Imagine a value.

58:02.381 --> 58:04.016
- Now double it.
- I can't.

58:04.083 --> 58:08.786
Exactly. You can't, because
you don't have imagination.

58:09.855 --> 58:13.858
Because you make your living
playing stuff other people write.

58:14.293 --> 58:16.334
That's what you're good at.
That's your talent.

58:16.395 --> 58:19.864
Leave the imagination to the
real authors, the real artists.

58:19.932 --> 58:22.199
You're just a petty thief.

58:23.702 --> 58:25.703
And you're just a puppet.

58:26.038 --> 58:29.640
A genius puppet, but just a puppet.

58:29.808 --> 58:32.810
Every time you take that stage,
you know it too.

58:32.846 --> 58:35.179
You have a great gift, Tom.

58:35.647 --> 58:37.715
But I've got a vision.

58:39.752 --> 58:43.154
So do as you're told.
Play "La Cinquette".

58:44.189 --> 58:47.024
- And don't freeze this time.
- Go to hell.

58:47.092 --> 58:48.793
Excuse me?

58:50.764 --> 58:52.863
Why would you let me go?

58:52.898 --> 58:53.965
Tom...

58:54.768 --> 58:59.136
Don't make me upset.
You know where that leads.

59:20.160 --> 59:22.660
I see you, you son of a bitch.

59:23.195 --> 59:25.162
You see what?

59:25.297 --> 59:26.664
Tom, what did you say?

59:28.367 --> 59:29.900
I said...

59:31.904 --> 59:33.539
I'll play it.

59:45.984 --> 59:48.020
Thank you so much.

59:48.620 --> 59:51.622
Take the front end
of the piece easy.

59:51.890 --> 59:55.159
Don't tire your fingers.
Save it just for the last four bars.

59:55.227 --> 59:56.095
And now, to cap off the evening,

59:56.096 --> 59:58.630
I'm going to yield the stage
to Mr. Selznick...

59:58.631 --> 59:59.364
Not one wrong note.

59:59.365 --> 01:00:01.567
- ...who will play...
- Now. Interrupt him.

01:00:01.568 --> 01:00:03.000
- ...a solo piece...
- Do it!

01:00:03.268 --> 01:00:05.771
- ...that Patrick Godureaux dearly loved.
- Do it now!

01:00:05.839 --> 01:00:08.739
- Ladies and gentlemen, "The Tempest".
- No!

01:00:13.745 --> 01:00:15.414
"La Cinquette".

01:00:17.716 --> 01:00:21.619
Excuse me.
Would you please repeat that?

01:00:22.321 --> 01:00:24.857
I'm playing "La Cinquette".

01:00:28.126 --> 01:00:30.127
The Unplayable Piece.

01:00:30.195 --> 01:00:33.432
- Did you know?
- I had no idea.

01:00:33.732 --> 01:00:36.200
played by his greatest pupil

01:00:36.268 --> 01:00:39.071
as a surprise change
to the program.

01:00:39.771 --> 01:00:44.408
Ladies and gentlemen,
history in the making.

01:00:45.277 --> 01:00:49.180
Tom Selznick plays "La Cinquette".

01:01:00.092 --> 01:01:02.560
Don't disappoint me, Tom.

01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:06.664
I won't disappoint my audience.

01:03:06.585 --> 01:03:08.852
Tom, you hear me?

01:03:10.622 --> 01:03:11.956
Tom?

01:03:14.793 --> 01:03:18.462
You're playing beautifully, Tom.
You're playing great.

01:03:18.697 --> 01:03:20.965
But you need to ease up, Tom.

01:03:24.336 --> 01:03:26.437
You hear me? Ease up.

01:03:26.472 --> 01:03:29.173
You're going to tire
out your fingers.

01:03:31.777 --> 01:03:33.844
Careful, Tom. Don't push the tempo,

01:03:33.945 --> 01:03:36.747
make sure you hit
those last four bars.

01:03:39.885 --> 01:03:43.487
Tom, if you don't ease up,
you're going to freeze it.

01:03:44.556 --> 01:03:46.523
You're going to burn out.

01:03:47.292 --> 01:03:48.994
You hear me talking to you,
you piece of shit?

01:03:48.995 --> 01:03:52.998
If you don't ease up, you're going to find
bits of your wife's skull in box seat five.

01:03:52.999 --> 01:03:55.466
Shut the fuck up!

01:04:56.461 --> 01:04:58.962
Tom, what did you do?

01:05:04.603 --> 01:05:07.004
You sniveling little piece of shit.

01:05:07.272 --> 01:05:11.809
You think this is some kind of a game?
I'll rip your throat out, goddamn it.

01:05:11.877 --> 01:05:13.778
You sniveling little piece of shit!

01:05:13.846 --> 01:05:15.146
Agh!

01:05:29.561 --> 01:05:31.895
Are you listening to me, Tom?

01:05:32.498 --> 01:05:35.467
You knew that was the
wrong note. You knew it!

01:05:35.468 --> 01:05:38.102
Yes. But the audience didn't.

01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:40.504
What the hell do you mean?

01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:44.375
They never do.

01:05:54.153 --> 01:05:56.353
Sit back down and play it again.

01:05:56.421 --> 01:05:58.589
Play the last four bars again,
play them right,

01:05:58.857 --> 01:06:02.594
or I swear to God, you'll be finding bits
of your wife's skull in box seat five.

01:06:02.595 --> 01:06:05.629
You hear me, Tom? I swear to God!

01:06:05.864 --> 01:06:08.434
You think about the people whose
lives you're cutting short.

01:06:08.435 --> 01:06:09.367
Think about your wife!

01:06:09.368 --> 01:06:13.205
You think about the blood on your
hands because you just lost your bet.

01:06:13.206 --> 01:06:14.272
Please, sit down.

01:06:14.273 --> 01:06:15.874
You just lost your bet, Tom!

01:06:15.875 --> 01:06:16.975
Except for you, Emma!

01:06:16.976 --> 01:06:19.176
I'm talking to you, Tom!

01:06:20.145 --> 01:06:21.145
Tom!

01:06:21.379 --> 01:06:22.647
A light for her, please!

01:06:22.648 --> 01:06:26.417
You think that's going to stop me?
You think I got something to lose?

01:06:26.851 --> 01:06:31.389
Sit back down and play it again.
Play the last four bars again.

01:06:31.390 --> 01:06:32.357
Play them right.

01:06:32.358 --> 01:06:35.926
The lovely woman you see
sitting up there is Emma.

01:06:36.228 --> 01:06:38.529
Emma Selznick, my wife,

01:06:38.597 --> 01:06:41.165
and, as I'm sure you know,
an incredibly gifted actress.

01:06:41.233 --> 01:06:42.699
What are you doing?

01:06:46.771 --> 01:06:48.872
- You know...
- I'm going to take her out now.

01:06:48.907 --> 01:06:50.641
- She's...
- I'm going to do it!

01:06:50.675 --> 01:06:53.143
- ...the only reason I'm here tonight.
- Do you hear me, Tom?

01:06:53.144 --> 01:06:56.613
She's the one you should thank,
not me. Please.

01:06:56.681 --> 01:07:00.250
If you don't do as I say right now, I'm
gonna take the bitch out point-blank.

01:07:00.385 --> 01:07:03.421
Are you out of your mind?
Everyone's looking at her.

01:07:03.422 --> 01:07:04.556
I don't give a...

01:07:05.125 --> 01:07:08.893
The change to your programs
Mr. Reisinger mentioned...

01:07:08.894 --> 01:07:10.629
- I'm losing you.
- ...was not just "La Cinquette".

01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:11.796
What do you expect me to do?

01:07:11.797 --> 01:07:15.433
We also have a very special
encore planned for you tonight.

01:07:15.434 --> 01:07:18.169
Look, man, you have
got to get a clear head.

01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:20.338
Norman, will you
please join me up here?

01:07:20.339 --> 01:07:21.206
Are you there?

01:07:21.207 --> 01:07:24.875
My friend, Norman Reisinger,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:07:25.310 --> 01:07:29.447
You just heard him call me his
friend, right? So I have witnesses.

01:07:30.582 --> 01:07:32.416
Okay, what have you got in mind?

01:07:32.518 --> 01:07:35.720
I want some help to encore
this extraordinary venue...

01:07:35.721 --> 01:07:38.489
I don't know what to do!

01:07:38.556 --> 01:07:42.727
Please, help me accompany
Emma Selznick in performing

01:07:42.728 --> 01:07:46.197
a selection of her choosing, for
this incredibly generous audience.

01:07:46.665 --> 01:07:48.366
You've got to be kidding!

01:07:48.367 --> 01:07:49.100
Sing for me.

01:07:49.101 --> 01:07:53.837
I had nothing to do
with this hijacking, Emma.

01:07:56.875 --> 01:07:58.775
A standard?

01:07:59.844 --> 01:08:01.112
A calypso.

01:08:03.515 --> 01:08:06.416
No, you're right,
it's too sexy for this crowd.

01:08:09.754 --> 01:08:11.122
I got it.

01:08:13.559 --> 01:08:14.658
Is that okay?

01:08:16.661 --> 01:08:19.263
Right. "Motherless Child" it is.

01:08:19.596 --> 01:08:22.799
Ladies and gentlemen,
Emma Selznick!

01:08:22.934 --> 01:08:25.202
Listen to me.
I'm packing up and I'm out of here.

01:08:25.270 --> 01:08:26.037
The hell you are!

01:08:26.037 --> 01:08:30.707
Open your eyes, open your ears.
Forget about the money, it's over!

01:08:35.613 --> 01:08:37.252
You're not walking out on me.

01:08:37.314 --> 01:08:40.853
Calm down. Let's just pack
up and get out of here.

01:08:40.854 --> 01:08:43.421
No! I spent three years on this!

01:08:43.856 --> 01:08:45.790
What are you...? What?

01:08:45.858 --> 01:08:49.394
What? Stop! You can't!
You crazy son of a...

01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:51.495
No!

01:08:52.897 --> 01:08:54.698
Are you listening?

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.667
Say goodbye to your wife.

01:09:00.104 --> 01:09:04.174
Sometimes I feel

01:09:04.209 --> 01:09:07.477
like a motherless child.

01:09:11.015 --> 01:09:15.720
You listen now, you piece of shit!
Don't you dare fucking touch her!

01:09:16.453 --> 01:09:21.491
A long, long way

01:09:21.826 --> 01:09:23.760
from home.

01:09:40.845 --> 01:09:42.511
Hi, Tom.

01:09:58.630 --> 01:10:02.299
Sometimes I feel

01:10:02.534 --> 01:10:05.502
like I just can't go on.

01:10:05.571 --> 01:10:09.040
Sometimes I feel

01:10:09.041 --> 01:10:13.076
like I might make it through.

01:10:13.344 --> 01:10:18.817
Sometimes I feel like
there's no place for us.

01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:26.023
Alone I pray

01:10:26.424 --> 01:10:32.396
to my Lord.

01:10:32.564 --> 01:10:37.968
Where's my home,

01:10:39.571 --> 01:10:43.206
my home?

01:11:06.798 --> 01:11:10.867
I'd rather die, I'd rather die.

01:11:13.004 --> 01:11:18.809
Sometimes I feel, sometimes
I feel like I just can't go on.

01:11:21.914 --> 01:11:25.682
Sometimes I feel like I
might make it through.

01:11:26.284 --> 01:11:31.455
Sometimes I feel

01:11:31.557 --> 01:11:36.727
like a motherless child.

01:11:38.029 --> 01:11:42.499
Sometimes I feel

01:11:43.569 --> 01:11:48.472
like a motherless child.

01:11:52.810 --> 01:11:56.379
A long,

01:11:56.648 --> 01:11:59.249
long way from home.

01:12:00.518 --> 01:12:05.322
A long, long way from home.

01:12:15.066 --> 01:12:16.801
Argh!

01:13:03.681 --> 01:13:06.017
Tom! Oh, my God!

01:13:06.018 --> 01:13:07.284
Tom!

01:13:24.736 --> 01:13:26.069
Tom!

01:13:26.404 --> 01:13:29.673
Oh, my God, sweetheart,
are you okay?

01:13:30.441 --> 01:13:32.209
Argh!

01:13:35.546 --> 01:13:37.814
I think I broke my leg.

01:15:10.675 --> 01:15:12.242
Emma...

01:15:16.981 --> 01:15:18.882
Can we please go home?

01:15:39.872 --> 01:15:40.904
Honey!

01:15:48.881 --> 01:15:51.348
I need to finish this.

01:15:52.305 --> 01:15:58.293
