WEBVTT

00:05.072 --> 00:07.074
Previously on "Heels"...

00:07.108 --> 00:08.476
Jack, I've got to get a job.

00:08.509 --> 00:09.543
And we're gonna
hold a press conference.

00:09.577 --> 00:10.745
Oww!

00:10.778 --> 00:13.381
You will do nothing
until we speak in person.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.117
Well, dang.

00:16.150 --> 00:18.018
-'Sup, Tricia?
-I get off in an hour.

00:18.052 --> 00:19.754
You should stay and flirt.

00:19.787 --> 00:22.656
I'm just a valet.
I gotta fly low right now.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.526
You are not just a valet.
You are really talented.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.628
You're the one that should
be getting the push.

00:27.661 --> 00:29.330
You got shit-canned,
didn't you?

00:29.363 --> 00:31.499
Oh, you think I fucked that up?
Your life ain't so perfect.

00:31.532 --> 00:32.666
I didn't say it was.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.069
And that daughter
you can't fucking stand.

00:35.102 --> 00:37.138
Too bad I wasn't around

00:37.171 --> 00:38.606
to pay for that abortion too.

00:39.507 --> 00:41.041
Bye, Bill.

00:41.075 --> 00:43.043
Fucking people
and all their bullshit,

00:43.077 --> 00:44.545
their untested manhood.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.414
Makes me want
to step on a frog.

00:46.447 --> 00:48.115
Somebody keyed my Bronco.

00:48.149 --> 00:49.683
Reckon you got it in you, too,

00:49.717 --> 00:51.285
just like your dad.

00:51.318 --> 00:54.722
He played nice for the crowds,
but Tom had a vicious side.

00:54.755 --> 00:57.124
You tap that vein,

00:57.158 --> 00:58.526
riches'll flow.

02:29.617 --> 02:33.521
Boo!

02:33.554 --> 02:36.357
I can't tell y'all
how upsetting this is.

02:36.390 --> 02:39.193
To be booed by you,

02:39.226 --> 02:42.563
a bunch of wannabes
and never-weres.

02:42.596 --> 02:46.300
Irrelevant dopes
who hate Ace and me

02:46.333 --> 02:48.502
for being what they wish
they were.

02:48.536 --> 02:52.206
Two perfect physical specimens

02:52.239 --> 02:54.341
at the height of our powers.

02:54.375 --> 02:58.746
And let me be crystal clear.

02:58.779 --> 03:01.482
We only care about one thing,

03:01.515 --> 03:03.784
and that is the DWL title belt.

03:03.817 --> 03:07.321
We are coming for it
with hostility in our hearts.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.457
We're gonna take you down,
Jack Spade!

03:11.325 --> 03:12.593
But first,

03:12.626 --> 03:17.398
we're gonna crush
the pitiful, puny dreams

03:17.431 --> 03:20.200
of that mama's boy Bobby Pin.

03:21.635 --> 03:24.505
Willie, can you kick up
the lights, please?

03:26.840 --> 03:28.709
That's really fucking good.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.278
I don't get this promo, man.

03:31.312 --> 03:32.880
All the talking,
it ruins the suspense.

03:32.913 --> 03:35.783
And "crystal clear"?
Come on. Nah.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.519
-I like it.
-I don't.

03:38.552 --> 03:41.255
What? You want me
to shave a little attitude off?

03:43.691 --> 03:44.925
I-I'm with Ace on this one.

03:44.959 --> 03:46.260
Gonna dump the promo.

03:46.293 --> 03:47.795
I want you two
to run the ending again.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.597
It's getting late.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.265
Hey, Crystal.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.369
Look, whether you get
to run your mouth or not,

03:55.402 --> 03:56.870
right,
you're in the main event.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.006
That's big for us.
It's big for your character.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.342
Now I know that you can
memorize lines like that

04:01.375 --> 04:03.243
and deliver them that well,

04:03.277 --> 04:04.712
I'm gonna write for you.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.480
It's good work.

04:06.513 --> 04:07.915
Missy,

04:07.948 --> 04:09.683
why don't you buy yourself
a new outfit, okay?

04:09.717 --> 04:11.885
And include a bra.
It's a family show.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.487
Let's leave the nipples
to the imagination.

04:14.355 --> 04:15.756
-Hey, Jack.
-Yeah?

04:15.789 --> 04:17.691
Me and Diego got
something bangin' for the show.

04:17.725 --> 04:18.959
I know you gon' rock with it.

04:18.993 --> 04:20.394
-You wanna see?
-Sure. Yeah.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.763
Is that a "sure" sure
or a "shut up" sure?

04:22.796 --> 04:24.398
We gotta nail this ending
here first.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.734
Hey, so, Ace,
you're on the ground.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.402
Right, he's cooked.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.371
I'm happy with that
because, as the guest referee,

04:30.404 --> 04:32.006
I want you to lose so I won't
have to face you again.

04:32.039 --> 04:35.275
Then Bobby, get your ass up
there for the frog splash.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.345
It's where you
stretch your body out.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.880
Like a fucking frog, dumbass.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.515
Bobby, top turnbuckle.

04:41.548 --> 04:42.916
Crystal, stop helping him.

04:44.485 --> 04:45.786
"Don't you dare
take a cheap shot

04:45.819 --> 04:46.854
"while he's down.

04:46.887 --> 04:47.988
Fight like a man!"

04:48.022 --> 04:49.823
"A real man shows no mercy."

04:52.793 --> 04:54.361
Bobby, that was terrible.

04:54.395 --> 04:55.562
Bobby, balance first,
then leap.

04:55.596 --> 04:56.697
Commit and you're good.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.065
-This is Willie.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.600
How did no one tell me
he's afraid of heights?

04:59.633 --> 05:00.734
He's not afraid of heights.

05:00.768 --> 05:02.069
He 100% is.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.370
That wasn't even that high.

05:03.404 --> 05:04.571
It's like jumping off
a fucking couch.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.073
I've done it plenty of times.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.509
Hey, Jack, it's
South Georgia State Fair.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.911
Well, tell 'em we don't have
money to advertise with them.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.646
About us performing
in the fair.

05:16.383 --> 05:17.618
We gon' take that in my office.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.421
Bobby, grow a fucking pair
and do it again.

05:22.089 --> 05:23.857
Greetings.

05:23.891 --> 05:26.627
I have some apologies to make.

05:26.660 --> 05:29.897
I am sorry that
I used language that has...

05:29.930 --> 05:33.567
apparently caused
some unspecified people pain.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.637
And ever since I was young,
I've feared flying.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.839
I mishandled
medicating my nerves.

05:38.872 --> 05:42.342
The result is me
standing here today,

05:42.376 --> 05:45.079
in the public square,
groveling.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.847
Are you ashamed
that you got naked?

05:46.880 --> 05:48.082
Hell, no.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.818
Fifty percent of the world
population is male.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.120
It should not be shocking
to see a man naked.

05:54.722 --> 05:57.591
Some consider this kind
of behavior toxic masculinity.

05:57.624 --> 05:59.793
Psychologists believe that

05:59.827 --> 06:01.528
this kind of behavior

06:01.562 --> 06:04.631
may be tied to my getting
circumcised the day I was born,

06:04.665 --> 06:07.401
as if, deep down, I'm still
that butchered little boy

06:07.434 --> 06:09.069
pulling it out
to show everyone,

06:09.103 --> 06:10.838
"Look at the horrible thing
they did to me."

06:10.871 --> 06:13.407
Isn't circumcision
about hygiene?

06:13.440 --> 06:15.642
Ma'am, every third
daydream a man has

06:15.676 --> 06:18.412
is about putting his penis
into someone else's mouth.

06:18.445 --> 06:20.981
The other two are about
putting it other places.

06:21.014 --> 06:23.717
Circumcision
is primeval cruelty.

06:23.751 --> 06:26.620
It's time for
"our bodies, our choice"

06:26.653 --> 06:28.889
to also apply
to boys' foreskins.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.390
Jesus Mary and Joseph...

06:30.424 --> 06:32.793
But look, there's a time
and place for male nudity

06:32.826 --> 06:35.462
and it's not midair
on a commercial jetliner.

06:35.496 --> 06:38.599
You fly private, that's a
different discussion entirely.

06:38.632 --> 06:40.100
There's rumors
you've been fired.

06:40.134 --> 06:42.402
Well, like many
long-serving employees

06:42.436 --> 06:44.004
of American corporations,

06:44.037 --> 06:46.106
I've been abandoned.

06:46.140 --> 06:48.008
What do you call
an entertainment empire

06:48.041 --> 06:50.110
built upon the broken bodies
of men and women who,

06:50.144 --> 06:52.646
once the juice is squeezed out,

06:52.679 --> 06:54.715
are kicked to the curb?

06:54.748 --> 06:57.484
No safety net
other than drugs, alcohol,

06:57.518 --> 06:58.852
and self-inflicted gunshots.

06:58.886 --> 07:00.721
The National Football League?

07:00.754 --> 07:04.124
After a stint in rehab,
I'll be back.

07:06.126 --> 07:07.528
Thank you.

07:08.529 --> 07:09.863
Thank you.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.034
What the fuck was that?

07:14.067 --> 07:16.103
That, my dear,
is called a deflection.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.504
Hey, Dad.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.506
If you call
and I don't pick up,

07:19.540 --> 07:22.643
I'm gon' be at work,
and they got rules there, so.

07:22.676 --> 07:25.512
I'm trying to make the right
impression on my first day.

07:25.546 --> 07:26.980
Just happy to be
getting out of the house.

07:27.014 --> 07:29.016
But hey, will you try
texting me?

07:29.049 --> 07:30.450
I know how much you hate that,

07:30.484 --> 07:31.652
but that is the world
we're living in.

07:31.685 --> 07:32.953
So I would appreciate it.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.822
All right, I love you. Bye-bye.

07:34.855 --> 07:37.991
-What do you say?
-Thanks.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.074
It's gon' ruin your hips...

07:54.107 --> 07:55.976
and your knees.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.978
Running puts mileage on 'em.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.479
Ruins 'em.

08:09.256 --> 08:10.991
How's Ace?

08:11.024 --> 08:13.060
-Oh, he's great.
-Bullshit.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.528
Look, Jack,
I know you're busy--

08:14.561 --> 08:15.963
Get lost, Bill.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.598
Busy growing
your daddy's little weed

08:17.631 --> 08:18.599
into a big weed.

08:18.632 --> 08:19.933
Here's the thing about weeds.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.602
You need somebody
to help 'em grow.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.637
I was thinking I might
be of use to you.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.005
Willie told me what you said.

08:25.038 --> 08:27.841
I was hammered
and I blurted something stupid.

08:27.875 --> 08:30.244
Sometimes when you drink
and blurt, you hurt.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.546
I won't apologize for there
still being a spark

08:32.579 --> 08:34.014
between Willie and I.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.116
It's a burden that sometimes
blinds our encounters.

08:36.149 --> 08:38.252
Jack, you need my expertise.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.921
You don't know, really,
what the fuck you're doing.

08:40.954 --> 08:42.189
You know some.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.057
I can turn "some"
into something much more.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.926
I should kick your fucking ass.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.628
Getting a bit huffy, son.

08:47.661 --> 08:48.896
I should kick
your fucking ass right now

08:48.929 --> 08:50.097
till you beg for mercy.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.598
-Easy.
-It would be easy.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.800
-Not sure about that.
-I'd laugh the whole time.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.202
Now you're turning me on.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.539
Bill...

08:59.573 --> 09:01.575
you're down on your luck.

09:01.608 --> 09:03.176
It's not gonna
change around here.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.178
So I'm gonna say this again,
and if you don't do it,

09:05.212 --> 09:07.180
I'm gonna see to it
that you do.

09:09.182 --> 09:11.151
You get lost,
you fucking monkey.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.799
Hey! Thomas.

09:25.832 --> 09:27.567
Uh, I'm gonna hop in the shower,

09:27.601 --> 09:28.635
then you and me gonna hit
the road.

09:28.669 --> 09:30.170
-So ready up, please.
-All right.

09:30.203 --> 09:31.672
Thank you.

09:33.707 --> 09:37.611
Mm, ladies and gentlemen,
Jack Spade is in the building.

09:37.644 --> 09:40.781
And, ooh, oh, my Lord
is he impressive!

09:40.814 --> 09:44.284
I have never seen a man so sexy

09:44.318 --> 09:46.186
and handsome...

09:46.219 --> 09:47.955
and sweaty and stanky.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.623
-Ooh!
-Well...

09:49.656 --> 09:51.758
DWL at the State Fair.
Jack, that is so exciting.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.660
It's exciting, but I'm nervous

09:53.694 --> 09:56.129
'cause I gotta close the deal
and I can't seem desperate.

09:56.163 --> 09:57.164
Mm-kay.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.335
Maybe I can help calm
your nerves.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.737
Calm me down
with the whole deal

10:03.770 --> 10:05.005
or, like, a half deal?

10:05.038 --> 10:06.239
What kind of deal you thinking?

10:06.273 --> 10:08.809
I got time
for a handshake deal.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.677
You give the best handshakes.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.379
All right, well, let's
at least get to the bathroom.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.814
Yeah.

10:16.383 --> 10:17.851
I'm ready, Dad!

10:17.884 --> 10:19.820
Hey uh, that's real
good work, buddy,

10:19.853 --> 10:23.290
but dad's gon' need about...
four to six minutes.

10:23.323 --> 10:24.624
Talk about pressure.

10:24.658 --> 10:26.226
Well, I believe in you.

10:29.363 --> 10:31.031
Hey, how's Thomas
gonna occupy himself

10:31.064 --> 10:32.265
when you're talking
to the State Fair people?

10:32.299 --> 10:33.367
I'ma give my phone to T.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.836
I got all the games
on my phone.

10:35.869 --> 10:38.038
If he brings up wanting
to get a pet gerbil, say no.

10:38.071 --> 10:39.940
Okay.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.675
And for dinner,
he hates chicken fingers now.

10:41.708 --> 10:43.810
And he already had a donut,
so no ice cream or fried dough.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.145
Okay, uh, well,

10:45.178 --> 10:46.780
that-that-that's
opposite of arousing.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.048
I'm expecting reciprocity.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.716
Oh, if I book the State Fair,

10:49.750 --> 10:50.984
I'm gon' get you every night
this week, two times.

10:51.018 --> 10:53.286
Promises, promises.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.256
Wow, that's--
ooh, you're raring to go.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.091
Well, don't stop then.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.326
This is my work shirt.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.261
I'll get in front of you.

11:39.733 --> 11:41.168
Hi. Uh, Tucker?

11:41.201 --> 11:43.136
Yeah, Reds over Cardinals.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.172
100 bucks. Run line.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.041
Thanks.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.816
Hey, buddy, we're gon'
meet some folks later

11:55.849 --> 11:57.918
and they might ask you why you
like coming to the matches.

11:57.951 --> 12:00.754
And you know, you just--
you tell them that we put on

12:00.787 --> 12:02.956
some good, old-fashioned family
entertainment, all right?

12:02.989 --> 12:05.258
Dad, our class gerbil
had babies.

12:05.292 --> 12:06.259
Okay.

12:06.293 --> 12:07.928
Ms. Brickey said
I could have one.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.129
You know, growing up,

12:09.162 --> 12:10.864
I-I-I knew a kid that used
to steal gerbils

12:10.897 --> 12:12.399
and feed 'em to a snake.

12:12.432 --> 12:14.334
That's kind of mean
a boy did that.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.269
That kid was a girl.

12:16.303 --> 12:17.871
Kristine Lang.

12:17.904 --> 12:20.440
Those gerbils
must have been scared.

12:20.474 --> 12:22.943
Wonder how long
it took them to die.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.418
We're gon' get you a gerbil,

12:31.451 --> 12:32.886
but you gotta promise me
right here and now,

12:32.919 --> 12:34.054
you gotta look out for it.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.455
You gotta be the gerbil king.

12:35.489 --> 12:37.991
Keep it away from kids
and cats and snakes, all right?

12:38.024 --> 12:39.025
I will, Dad.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.861
I promise I will. Thank you.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.967
Bobby Pin's got
a new tag partner.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.269
Ace gon' be
crying again.

12:49.302 --> 12:50.804
Yeah.

12:50.837 --> 12:52.405
Are we still
getting you a new costume?

12:52.439 --> 12:54.174
I got it set aside at the mall.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.342
Just need this money.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.277
So say a prayer
to the gambling gods.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.246
Nobody ever won a bet watching.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.982
That's not true,
but it's sweet.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.350
Hey, Crystal,
where's Ace?

13:03.383 --> 13:04.851
I don't know where he is.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.153
Well, you should.
You're his valet.

13:06.186 --> 13:07.888
Go find him. For fuck's sake.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.022
-Hey, Thomas.
-Hey, Willie.

13:09.055 --> 13:10.223
There's my guy.

13:10.257 --> 13:12.092
Thomas, where you been, bro?

13:12.125 --> 13:14.261
All right, gather round, y'all!

13:15.962 --> 13:18.265
Well, we got the same
old show tonight, all right?

13:18.298 --> 13:20.333
Same asses in the seats.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.335
Gon' sign the same autographs.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.070
Same lights in your eyes.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.006
Same sweat. Same grind.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.208
It's the same old, same old.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.945
Well, except for one thing.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.347
Right over there,
we're gonna have three people

13:34.381 --> 13:36.449
from the South Georgia
State Fair Commission

13:36.483 --> 13:38.518
here to see y'all,

13:38.552 --> 13:42.088
here to watch our fans
go crazy for all of you.

13:42.122 --> 13:45.358
We're gonna give these people
one hell of a night.

13:45.392 --> 13:47.060
We're gonna finish it
in the cage.

13:49.863 --> 13:52.899
Now, if they like
what they see--

13:52.933 --> 13:54.935
and I promise you,

13:54.968 --> 13:56.503
they will--

13:56.536 --> 13:58.138
about a month from now,

13:58.171 --> 14:02.275
y'all are gonna be performing
for 10,000 folks.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.914
So it's not the same old,
same old.

14:07.948 --> 14:11.151
I want y'all to destroy
for these people tonight!

14:11.184 --> 14:14.287
-Yeah!

14:14.321 --> 14:15.589
Now, here to read the rundown,

14:15.622 --> 14:16.990
may I introduce to you,

14:17.023 --> 14:20.961
Mr. Thomas Patrick Spade!

14:20.994 --> 14:24.264
-Thomas!

14:25.632 --> 14:28.401
All right, men, listen up.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.105
Come on. One time.

14:33.006 --> 14:35.041
It is...go!

14:35.075 --> 14:36.409
-Two-run homerun! Reds win!
-Oh! You got it! You got it!

14:36.443 --> 14:38.545
-You got it! Whoo!

14:38.578 --> 14:41.615
-Whoo!
-I got money!

14:41.648 --> 14:43.883
-Yeah!
-I got money.

14:43.917 --> 14:45.285
How much money
did you get off of it?

14:45.318 --> 14:46.453
Enough to get
my whole outfit.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.488
-Yeah!

14:48.521 --> 14:50.257
Thank you.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.426
Hurry up. We're gonna be late.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.996
You're late. I ain't late.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.964
You're the one
who had to have Church's.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.399
KFC would have been fine.

14:59.432 --> 15:02.569
Well, excuse me
for considering my digestion.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.374
All right,
I went ahead

15:07.407 --> 15:08.375
and confirmed your dinner

15:08.408 --> 15:09.376
with the State Fair woman.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.477
Her name is Constance.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.178
Thank you. Look who woke up.

15:12.212 --> 15:13.647
Sorry, phone died. 'Sup, stud?

15:13.680 --> 15:15.582
-Hey, Uncle Ace.
-'Sup, y'all?

15:15.615 --> 15:17.584
Y'all know Tricia.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.152
-Nope.
-Nuh-uh.

15:19.185 --> 15:20.487
I bartend down at Cooper's.

15:20.520 --> 15:23.189
Tricia's my new valet.

15:40.573 --> 15:42.075
Hey, Howard?

15:42.108 --> 15:44.144
I organized these by expiration
date, then, within that,

15:44.177 --> 15:46.112
I alphabetized them
according to SKU.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.548
Though if the scanner gun
breaks, that may not matter.

15:48.581 --> 15:51.184
Staci, are you gunning
for my job on the first day?

15:51.217 --> 15:52.419
No.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.354
All right.
Keep up the good work.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.691
Oh, no worries. I got it.

15:57.724 --> 16:00.627
I got you. I got it.

16:02.228 --> 16:04.331
Staci Spade.

16:04.364 --> 16:05.532
You work here?

16:05.565 --> 16:07.634
I do, Bill. You shop here?

16:07.667 --> 16:09.736
I'm back in town
for a bit, yes.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.005
Keeps me grounded
to purchase my sustenance

16:12.038 --> 16:13.606
amongst poor,
hardworking folks.

16:14.407 --> 16:17.243
Sorry the pickles slipped.
Got a touch of arthritis.

16:17.277 --> 16:20.080
These hands of mine
have been in lots of places,

16:20.113 --> 16:21.214
but I don't kiss and tell,

16:21.247 --> 16:22.749
so you gon' have to ask around.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.418
Uh, you don't have to say
something gross to impress me.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.054
Why do you think
I'd say something gross?

16:28.088 --> 16:29.255
Well, isn't that
your character?

16:29.289 --> 16:31.358
Saying gross and nasty things.

16:31.391 --> 16:32.492
Only when I'm in the ring.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.394
Outside the ring,
I'm a regular choir boy.

16:36.062 --> 16:37.430
Money must be getting tight
at home.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.199
Jack making you work now?

16:39.232 --> 16:41.234
No, things don't work
like that at our house, Bill.

16:41.267 --> 16:42.435
My working's my choice.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.070
Enjoy it.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.539
Never know when you might
be unexpectedly unemployed.

16:46.573 --> 16:50.343
Things can be
humming along and, bam!

16:52.679 --> 16:55.348
Almost had us a "Lady
and the Tramp" moment there.

16:55.382 --> 16:56.583
Okay.

16:58.718 --> 17:01.054
Jeez, Jack really did
a number on me with you.

17:01.087 --> 17:03.356
I don't get why y'all gotta
hate an old family friend.

17:03.390 --> 17:05.658
An old family friend
wouldn't come down here

17:05.692 --> 17:07.560
and poach Ace.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.162
Only the envious would consider

17:09.195 --> 17:11.398
Ace's opportunity as poaching.

17:11.431 --> 17:12.766
You wanna stick it to Jack,
I guess,

17:12.799 --> 17:14.300
'cause he reminds you of Tom?

17:14.334 --> 17:16.102
Jack ain't half
the talent his daddy was,

17:16.136 --> 17:18.138
but he sure is the same
cocky somebitch

17:18.171 --> 17:19.672
whose arrogance
seems a bit misplaced

17:19.706 --> 17:21.775
considering his staggering
lack of accomplishments.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.243
He's a good man.

17:23.276 --> 17:26.045
A great man who works hard
to support his family.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.680
Yet, he's failing miserably.

17:28.381 --> 17:32.352
Look at you, Queen of the DWL,
down on her knees,

17:32.385 --> 17:33.520
hands on my pickle.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.655
Fuck you, you piece of shit.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.825
-Is everything okay?
-Oh, yes, sir.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.795
Just had a mishap and this kind
duchess here was assisting me.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.730
Oh, well, you don't
have to clean up, sir.

17:43.763 --> 17:44.831
We'll take care of it.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.166
Staci, will you
please grab a broom

17:46.199 --> 17:47.300
before this gentleman
cuts himself?

17:47.333 --> 17:48.535
Yup. I'm on it, Howard.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.069
Right away.

17:50.103 --> 17:51.104
Be sure to stop
at the soap aisle,

17:51.137 --> 17:52.739
wash out that mouth of yours.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.276
You know, Jack's breathing
new life into the DWL

17:56.309 --> 17:59.312
while also building the kind of
family life you'll never have.

17:59.345 --> 18:01.448
Long as he doesn't do like Tom,
put a gun in his mouth,

18:01.481 --> 18:02.715
it's a win.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.518
Fuck you, you sad,
pathetic, piece of shit.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.854
Once Jack lands
the South Georgia State Fair

18:08.087 --> 18:09.589
tonight,
he's gon' prove you wrong.

18:09.622 --> 18:12.225
Not that he fancies
to impress a fool.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.763
State Fair, huh?

18:16.796 --> 18:17.831
Hoo.

18:19.132 --> 18:20.633
That is a big stage.

18:22.735 --> 18:26.206
Looking forward to see how
the Spades fuck that one up.

18:30.543 --> 18:31.744
What do you think?

18:31.778 --> 18:33.746
Wow.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.683
Uh, "wow" is good,
but for 109 bucks,

18:36.716 --> 18:37.817
I need at least good.

18:37.851 --> 18:39.319
You look great.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.421
You look great
with nothing on--anything.

18:48.194 --> 18:50.463
Yeah.

18:52.899 --> 18:55.568
Ah.

18:55.602 --> 18:57.337
All right, Roo.

18:58.671 --> 19:02.442
Ah! Ah!

19:02.475 --> 19:03.476
You're killing me, Diego.

19:03.510 --> 19:04.511
Oh, no.

19:04.544 --> 19:05.745
Ah!

19:05.778 --> 19:07.580
And that's when you
holler for the medics.

19:07.614 --> 19:09.449
"Help, medics, help.
He's hurt."

19:09.482 --> 19:10.783
Yup, and then that's
when the fake medics

19:10.817 --> 19:12.385
-come out with a stretcher.
-Right. Mm-hmm.

19:12.418 --> 19:14.454
And then I give a thumbs up
to the crowd with my good arm.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.623
-We high five.
-Yeah!

19:16.656 --> 19:18.291
'Cause you know,
the DWL is all about

19:18.324 --> 19:19.759
-friendship and camaraderie.
-Mm-hmm.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.461
And those stuffed-shirt
State Fair asses

19:21.494 --> 19:22.762
that Jack's kissing,

19:22.795 --> 19:24.430
they gon' love it.

19:24.464 --> 19:25.565
Ain't that right, Thomas?

19:25.598 --> 19:27.200
Rooster, that was so good.

19:27.233 --> 19:28.735
I thought you were really hurt.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.937
Yes, you did,
'cause I'm good like that.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.373
But what if
you got hurt for real?

19:33.406 --> 19:35.441
Oh, that ain't gonna happen.
Know how I know?

19:35.475 --> 19:38.244
'Cause I ain't working with
Bobby Pin's rookie ass tonight.

19:39.612 --> 19:40.947
It's all right.
My rookie ass can take it.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.315
Guys.

19:42.348 --> 19:44.617
I'm okay.
My dad says that word.

19:44.651 --> 19:45.785
See, if it was a real injury,

19:45.818 --> 19:48.254
Diego would put up the X
with his arms like that.

19:48.288 --> 19:49.322
-Then--
-They'd probably send out

19:49.355 --> 19:50.757
some fake-ass medics.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.358
-Well.

19:52.392 --> 19:53.660
Hey, Crystal and Bobby,

19:53.693 --> 19:55.595
Jack wants to see y'all
in his office.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.269
Hey, Crystal,
take a seat.

20:08.675 --> 20:09.943
Ace and I have been
talking about

20:09.976 --> 20:11.711
a couple of different ideas.

20:11.744 --> 20:13.346
We're gonna go in a bit of
a different direction tonight.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.648
Y'all two will stay together
through autographs.

20:15.682 --> 20:16.950
You go down
to the ring together,

20:16.983 --> 20:18.518
but then he's gonna grab a mic

20:18.551 --> 20:20.820
and tell the crowd that
the two of you are breaking up

20:20.853 --> 20:23.523
because he caught you going
behind his back with Bobby Pin.

20:23.556 --> 20:24.657
Bobby, we're gonna shoot

20:24.691 --> 20:26.225
some photographs
of the two of you

20:26.259 --> 20:27.594
that Ace can wave around
in the ring

20:27.627 --> 20:28.761
as proof of the infidelity.

20:28.795 --> 20:30.630
Shouldn't be hard
for the audience to see.

20:30.663 --> 20:31.698
Can't exactly beam 'em up

20:31.731 --> 20:32.865
on a fucking jumbotron, can we?

20:32.899 --> 20:34.534
The technology exists.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.502
-Just saying.
-Thank you, Debbie.

20:36.536 --> 20:37.737
You got a spare jumbotron,
Debbie?

20:37.770 --> 20:39.372
-I do not.
-Thank you, Debbie.

20:40.406 --> 20:41.541
Bobby, the angle's gonna be

20:41.574 --> 20:42.809
that the two of y'all
are in love.

20:42.842 --> 20:43.876
Cool.

20:45.278 --> 20:46.679
Ace, what is this?

20:46.713 --> 20:48.581
Hey, Crystal,

20:48.615 --> 20:49.916
this is my call.

20:51.317 --> 20:53.252
Then Ace'll say...

20:53.286 --> 20:54.754
"You may think it's love,

20:54.787 --> 20:57.457
but she'll break your heart
just as she broke mine."

20:58.324 --> 20:59.926
Uh, "Lucky for me,

20:59.959 --> 21:01.394
"there's plenty of fish
in the sea

21:01.427 --> 21:02.729
and I got the biggest rod."

21:02.762 --> 21:04.397
Ace, y-your fucking ad-libs.
For Christ's sake.

21:04.430 --> 21:05.565
Come on.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.300
"Lucky for me,
I got a new valet.

21:07.333 --> 21:08.568
Duffy, meet Tricia."

21:08.601 --> 21:10.370
Then I guess I'll just
go out there and do like--

21:10.403 --> 21:11.971
Not much of anything,
sweetheart.

21:12.005 --> 21:13.439
Oh, come on.

21:13.473 --> 21:14.574
I thought I'd do, like,
a cartwheel or something.

21:14.607 --> 21:15.775
But you won't.

21:15.808 --> 21:16.876
Bobby, we're gonna keep
y'all two together

21:16.909 --> 21:17.877
for the next little bit.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.345
Y'all good?

21:19.379 --> 21:20.346
Yup.

21:20.380 --> 21:21.714
Yeah.

21:21.748 --> 21:23.549
Well, um,

21:23.583 --> 21:25.351
uh, w-when Bobby gets up
on the ropes

21:25.385 --> 21:27.620
to do the frog splash,

21:27.654 --> 21:28.955
I'm supposed to distract him,

21:28.988 --> 21:30.490
so...

21:31.658 --> 21:33.359
What? Is-is, uh,
she gonna do it now?

21:33.393 --> 21:34.761
No, I'm
gonna do that now,

21:34.794 --> 21:37.730
with the hook being that I
just need my rematch with Ace.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.466
Yeah.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.669
It's good.
It-it's better, probably.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.337
All right, Crystal,
go change your outfit.

21:44.370 --> 21:45.538
And then you and Bobby meet me

21:45.571 --> 21:46.773
in the washroom,
ten minutes, for photos.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.441
Jack, you need
to head out to dinner.

21:48.474 --> 21:50.476
All right, well,
thank y'all for being flexible.

21:50.510 --> 21:51.978
Debbie's gonna handle
the autographs

21:52.011 --> 21:53.513
'cause I won't be here
for prep with Willie,

21:53.546 --> 21:57.316
but uh, we are gonna
be amazing tonight.

21:57.350 --> 21:58.584
All of us.

21:58.618 --> 21:59.719
We're gonna wow
the state fair people,

21:59.752 --> 22:00.887
we're gonna close the deal,

22:00.920 --> 22:03.656
and all of our fortunes
will change.

22:03.690 --> 22:07.060
I love it.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.496
Ace.

22:11.864 --> 22:12.965
You could have
just talked to me.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.634
Why are you doing this?

22:14.667 --> 22:15.835
I'm doing what's best
for my character, Crystal.

22:15.868 --> 22:17.970
It's a better story.
You said so yourself.

22:18.738 --> 22:20.406
It's nothing personal.
It's business.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.011
I used to be a cheerleader.

22:25.044 --> 22:26.879
Varsity, two years.

22:39.759 --> 22:41.861
Hope we didn't get stood up.

22:41.894 --> 22:43.029
Why did Grandpa Tom

22:43.062 --> 22:45.131
gives the DWL to you
and not Ace?

22:45.364 --> 22:46.966
Well, 'cause I'm older.
Because I wanted it.

22:46.999 --> 22:48.468
Uncle Ace wanted
something different,

22:48.501 --> 22:50.636
but now he's more invested.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.071
Did Uncle Ace want to be bad?

22:52.105 --> 22:54.107
No, he did not.

22:54.140 --> 22:55.975
No, that was the decision
that I made

22:56.008 --> 22:57.643
'cause I write the shows.

22:57.677 --> 22:58.778
I made him turn heel.

22:58.811 --> 23:00.513
But Uncle Ace is a good person.

23:00.546 --> 23:01.881
Right. No, his character's bad.

23:01.914 --> 23:03.149
Your uncle Ace isn't bad.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.852
Same as me when
I'm just playing bad guys.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.386
Why do you have to?

23:08.488 --> 23:10.990
'Cause bad guys exist
and people want to see things

23:11.023 --> 23:12.959
portrayed that exist
in real life.

23:12.992 --> 23:14.627
That's why me and your mama

23:14.660 --> 23:16.496
are raising
a good guy like you--

23:16.529 --> 23:18.030
to offset the bad.

23:18.064 --> 23:20.099
And I think it's what's best
for the story.

23:21.067 --> 23:23.503
That's all wrestling is, buddy.
It's just stories.

23:25.805 --> 23:27.740
So I guess we have
two valets now?

23:27.774 --> 23:31.077
Willie, if this is
such an important event,

23:31.110 --> 23:33.179
then why is Jack
relying on a new valet

23:33.412 --> 23:35.414
like Tricia fucking Bell?

23:35.448 --> 23:37.150
Jack likes excitement.
I don't know.

23:37.183 --> 23:39.018
I just know his gut instincts.
We follow 'em.

23:39.051 --> 23:40.620
We're better off.

23:40.653 --> 23:41.621
Willie, what are
you doing down there?

23:41.654 --> 23:43.022
Getting the picture.

23:43.055 --> 23:44.090
Trying to make it look cleaner,

23:44.123 --> 23:45.525
like I'm sneaking.

23:45.558 --> 23:46.893
Go on, get your hands
all over one another.

23:50.730 --> 23:51.964
Like you're about to have sex.

23:53.199 --> 23:55.535
I'll count us in.
On three. Ready?

23:55.568 --> 23:57.603
-Yeah.
-One, two, three.

23:59.772 --> 24:01.674
Christ.
It's like you're related.

24:01.707 --> 24:02.809
And not in the hot way.
Good Lord.

24:02.842 --> 24:04.210
Bobby. Pull her in.

24:04.443 --> 24:05.978
We're not doing an immaculate
conception plotline.

24:06.012 --> 24:07.780
Theoretically,
this girl gives you a boner.

24:08.614 --> 24:09.816
-Okay, you sit here.
-Mm-hmm.

24:09.849 --> 24:11.651
I'm going to straddle you.
Cool?

24:11.684 --> 24:12.752
Okay.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.587
Just gonna get right...okay.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.622
Okay.

24:22.228 --> 24:24.530
That's it. Off to print 'em.

24:31.704 --> 24:32.939
Sorry.

24:34.607 --> 24:36.209
-Have a great show.
-You too.

24:36.242 --> 24:38.144
I'm gonna just...

24:39.145 --> 24:40.913
There we go.

24:44.817 --> 24:47.053
All right.

24:47.086 --> 24:48.988
Okay.

24:50.556 --> 24:51.958
I don't know much
about wrestling.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.860
I grew up
a big SCC football fan.

24:53.893 --> 24:55.127
Oh, me too. Go, Dawgs.

24:55.161 --> 24:56.195
I went to Auburn.

24:56.229 --> 24:57.663
Well, I'm so sorry
to hear that.

24:58.931 --> 25:00.833
I'm more of a "Jeopardy!"
kind of guy.

25:00.867 --> 25:03.035
Yeah, and I can
speak on musical theater

25:03.069 --> 25:04.670
and figure skating.

25:04.704 --> 25:07.840
Which is to say, we are
not wrestling aficionados,

25:07.874 --> 25:10.209
but we're intrigued
about adding wrestling

25:10.243 --> 25:11.644
to our attractions.

25:11.677 --> 25:13.880
And we got a 10,000-seat arena.

25:13.913 --> 25:16.616
Constance came on board to
rethink our engagement points,

25:16.649 --> 25:19.118
how to bring more people in
and entertain them better.

25:19.151 --> 25:20.653
Yeah, I'm sure
you're wondering why

25:20.686 --> 25:21.988
you got this call
out of the blue, Jack,

25:22.021 --> 25:23.689
but our research has vetted

25:23.723 --> 25:26.926
how popular independent
professional wrestling is

25:26.959 --> 25:29.695
throughout Georgia, Alabama,
and North Florida.

25:29.729 --> 25:31.631
Some of our junior team members

25:31.664 --> 25:33.532
delved into
your social media posts,

25:33.566 --> 25:34.667
your promos, your products.

25:34.700 --> 25:36.702
I mean, it is very impressive.

25:36.736 --> 25:38.771
Well, thank you.
We sure do work hard.

25:38.804 --> 25:40.973
Uh, a little-little
background, here.

25:41.007 --> 25:43.309
My dad created the league
about 30 years ago

25:43.542 --> 25:46.612
and, uh, people in Duffy
still come out every weekend

25:46.646 --> 25:47.880
because he built something

25:47.914 --> 25:49.282
that people really feel
like they're a part of.

25:49.315 --> 25:51.584
I mean, we're Duffy.
We're not--we're not Atlanta.

25:51.617 --> 25:53.719
We don't have
the Braves or the Hawks

25:53.753 --> 25:55.254
or NASCAR or the Falcons.

25:55.288 --> 25:57.023
We've got the DWL belt.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.257
It's our championship, and--

25:58.291 --> 26:00.059
and people feel like
they're a part of it

26:00.092 --> 26:01.594
'cause of our authenticity.

26:01.627 --> 26:03.229
But how do you keep
the fans excited

26:03.262 --> 26:04.730
when none of it's real?

26:04.764 --> 26:05.798
It's a story.

26:05.831 --> 26:07.133
Like, a real story.

26:07.166 --> 26:08.267
Like Ace.

26:08.301 --> 26:10.836
He's the hero,
and everyone loves him

26:10.870 --> 26:12.939
because he's just, like,
a good person.

26:12.972 --> 26:14.941
But then he lost to my daddy

26:14.974 --> 26:17.243
and he just couldn't take it
that he was the loser.

26:17.276 --> 26:18.811
So then he became a heel.

26:18.844 --> 26:20.713
A-a heel?

26:20.746 --> 26:22.882
-Yeah, a bad guy.
-Oh.

26:22.915 --> 26:25.284
And now he wants revenge.
Like, he's really mad.

26:25.318 --> 26:27.353
Like, really, really
mad at my dad

26:27.586 --> 26:29.355
to prove everyone was wrong.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.691
And you go to the show
and you're just, like,

26:31.724 --> 26:33.059
waiting to see
what he's gonna do.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.227
Is he gonna remember
he's a good person?

26:35.261 --> 26:37.797
Or does he care too much
about winning,

26:37.830 --> 26:39.265
that, when the ref
has his back turned,

26:39.298 --> 26:41.067
he's gonna do something
like kick my daddy

26:41.100 --> 26:42.335
where the sun don't shine?

26:42.368 --> 26:43.970
-My goodness.

26:44.003 --> 26:45.371
I wish I could tell you
that I wrote that for him,

26:45.604 --> 26:47.306
but my scripts
are rarely that concise.

26:48.274 --> 26:49.976
We're thrilled that you're here

26:50.009 --> 26:51.978
and we've got a great show
planned for y'all tonight.

26:52.011 --> 26:53.379
You can ask me anything,

26:53.612 --> 26:55.781
and as long as you don't make
me spill any trade secrets,

26:55.815 --> 26:58.985
I can explain to you why
we're a good fit for your fair.

27:04.924 --> 27:07.259
Have a good one.

27:07.293 --> 27:10.162
You don't need to do this.
We're a good team.

27:10.196 --> 27:11.297
Were.

27:15.935 --> 27:17.203
There you go.

27:17.236 --> 27:19.372
Oh, hey, make sure
he spelled Ace correctly.

27:19.405 --> 27:22.108
Those three-letter words
can get mighty complicated.

27:24.310 --> 27:27.213
-That's Wild Bill!
-Hello, beautiful.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.017
-I ain't gon' bite you.

27:40.192 --> 27:42.661
That'll be 15 even.

27:43.763 --> 27:46.732
I'm sorry.
I got nothing smaller.

27:52.938 --> 27:55.007
Thank you.

28:42.421 --> 28:44.023
I gotta take a leak.

28:48.894 --> 28:51.030
It takes a lady
to tamp down the envy

28:51.063 --> 28:53.799
of a juvenile jackass like Ace.

28:53.833 --> 28:55.968
Valets rarely get the credit.

28:56.001 --> 28:57.269
Shit, if it weren't
for the tenacity

28:57.303 --> 28:58.904
of some of my old gals,

28:58.938 --> 29:01.207
I'd have never made it
to the stage half the time.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.109
Wild Bill,
can we take a picture?

29:03.142 --> 29:04.743
Sure. Snap away.
Here to please.

29:04.777 --> 29:06.145
What the hell you think
you're doing?

29:06.178 --> 29:07.980
She's not taking the photo.

29:08.013 --> 29:09.415
She's gon' be in it.

29:09.448 --> 29:11.484
Will somebody
take our photo, please?

29:11.517 --> 29:13.219
Gonna be worth money soon.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.154
Mark my words. She's a star.

29:15.187 --> 29:17.990
Smile for the camera.
You're not going anywhere.

29:18.023 --> 29:19.325
You're blowing up.

29:21.827 --> 29:23.162
Hello, Bill.

29:23.195 --> 29:25.064
Sweet Debbie, my dear.
How are you?

29:25.097 --> 29:27.867
Fine. And I don't want
to get in the middle here,

29:27.900 --> 29:29.268
but that is where I am now.

29:29.301 --> 29:32.271
I was told Jack told you
to stay away from here.

29:32.304 --> 29:34.206
Well, Jack was talking
'bout a lot of things,

29:34.240 --> 29:36.108
the most intriguing of which
was the promise

29:36.142 --> 29:37.443
he and I would have
some fun together.

29:37.476 --> 29:39.078
It sounded so tempting,
I showed up.

29:39.111 --> 29:41.013
-Yeah, don't try to--
-Hey, Bill.

29:41.046 --> 29:42.481
One more, Bill. Please.

29:42.515 --> 29:43.983
Put him in a headlock, Bill.

29:45.084 --> 29:46.785
-Just trying to help y'all

29:46.819 --> 29:49.288
make a good impression
for the State Fair delegation.

29:49.321 --> 29:51.457
I know how important it is
for y'all to succeed

29:51.490 --> 29:54.226
so this place doesn't fold
and put everyone out of work.

29:54.260 --> 29:56.395
You've known me since way back
when I was a rook.

29:56.428 --> 29:58.964
You know my intentional heart.

29:58.998 --> 30:00.432
Just...

30:00.466 --> 30:02.434
sit in the crowd
where Jack can't see you.

30:02.468 --> 30:05.838
And please try
to keep your clothes on.

30:05.871 --> 30:07.506
Oh, there's the Debbie I know.

30:07.540 --> 30:09.041
Shut up.

30:19.485 --> 30:21.153
You were a big help
at dinner, buddy.

30:21.187 --> 30:22.588
Can we go
to Ms. Brickey's house

30:22.821 --> 30:24.223
to get the gerbil
after the show?

30:24.256 --> 30:25.357
We can go tomorrow.

30:25.391 --> 30:27.059
You want me to get you
a seat up there

30:27.092 --> 30:28.227
by ringside, front row?

30:28.260 --> 30:29.962
Nah, I wanna be
backstage with you.

30:29.995 --> 30:31.931
I like watching you work
and all.

30:37.036 --> 30:38.404
You think
this might actually work?

30:38.437 --> 30:40.272
Like, maybe
we'll get to perform

30:40.306 --> 30:41.473
in front of 10,000 people?

30:41.507 --> 30:43.075
This not good enough for you?

30:43.108 --> 30:44.510
Ten thousand people.

30:44.543 --> 30:46.278
Everything Tom Spade
dreamed of doing.

30:46.312 --> 30:48.314
-It's cool.
-It is cool.

30:50.082 --> 30:51.083
Good luck, man.

30:55.187 --> 30:57.456
Yo, it's packed out there, man.

30:57.489 --> 30:59.959
What's good for Jack
clearly ain't good for me.

31:02.895 --> 31:05.064
I got value. I got skills.

31:06.131 --> 31:08.901
Either Jack don't see it
or he don't want to.

31:08.934 --> 31:11.437
Dude, every day,
it's the same fucking story

31:11.470 --> 31:12.871
with you lately.

31:12.905 --> 31:14.206
I mean,
you're in here bellyaching

31:14.240 --> 31:15.908
'cause Jack's giving me
the push tonight

31:15.941 --> 31:18.444
in the Battle Royal
and I'm supposed to feel sorry?

31:18.477 --> 31:21.213
I don't give a shit
about any of this, okay?

31:21.247 --> 31:22.314
About Jack,

31:22.348 --> 31:24.116
about who wins the stupid
Battle Royal

31:24.149 --> 31:25.384
or the belt.

31:25.417 --> 31:26.885
I mean, I just want to wrestle.

31:28.387 --> 31:30.022
Look, man,

31:30.055 --> 31:33.525
you and I are the last two men
standing in the battle tonight.

31:33.559 --> 31:36.262
What if you won, huh?
Who would care?

31:36.929 --> 31:38.530
Yeah, you wanna win?

31:38.564 --> 31:41.667
Win. I'll fall out the ring.
You'll be champ.

31:44.370 --> 31:46.005
Jack would lose his shit.

31:46.038 --> 31:48.474
I'll say I tripped.

31:48.507 --> 31:50.342
You're my friend.

31:50.376 --> 31:52.044
I want you happy. Not him.

31:53.145 --> 31:54.313
All right?

31:55.981 --> 31:59.251
Come on, baby. Shit.

32:33.485 --> 32:34.953
Hey!

32:34.987 --> 32:36.322
Did you seal the deal?

32:36.355 --> 32:38.957
Uh, well, if we have a good
show tonight, it's ours.

32:38.991 --> 32:40.459
Then let's good-show this shit.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.263
Pardon me, Thomas.

32:44.296 --> 32:45.497
So uptight.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.261
Good luck tonight.

33:18.364 --> 33:20.265
Mind if I give you some advice?

33:23.035 --> 33:25.003
I'm not really a part
of the show tonight,

33:25.037 --> 33:26.672
so it's not necessary.

33:28.741 --> 33:31.243
The attention you got at
autographs is any indication,

33:31.276 --> 33:33.178
you're a big part
of every show.

33:35.080 --> 33:37.616
So when you walk out
to the ring,

33:37.649 --> 33:40.586
pull your hair back so
the crowd can really see you.

33:42.121 --> 33:44.790
Your pretty face is a bigger
draw than any muscles.

33:46.492 --> 33:48.093
Why else would Ace
be so caustic?

33:48.127 --> 33:49.395
He's jealous.

33:49.428 --> 33:50.796
I'd be jealous too
if I had a valet

33:51.029 --> 33:52.531
getting bigger pops than I was.

33:54.466 --> 33:57.035
Well, I'm not Ace's valet
after tonight.

33:57.703 --> 34:00.406
Script has me getting dumped
'cause I was caught cheating.

34:02.307 --> 34:03.475
Shit.

34:03.509 --> 34:07.579
Jack can be so...
short-sighted.

34:07.613 --> 34:09.715
Protecting the feelings
of his man-child brother.

34:09.748 --> 34:11.817
In my day, these things
weren't so scripted.

34:13.285 --> 34:14.653
This league's got some buzz

34:14.686 --> 34:17.556
'cause he went off script with
the Duffy screw-job on Ace.

34:17.589 --> 34:20.426
If Jack was smart,
he'd mine that drama.

34:20.459 --> 34:23.429
Let it be dramatic,
improvisational.

34:23.462 --> 34:26.131
Crowds believe it most when
you say what you really feel.

34:28.834 --> 34:30.269
You got chops.

34:32.571 --> 34:35.507
So if you get a feeling,
lean into it.

34:35.541 --> 34:37.576
If it's not scripted
as your time,

34:37.609 --> 34:40.579
seize the moment
and make it your time.

34:40.612 --> 34:43.515
Make everybody else react
to what you do.

34:43.549 --> 34:46.385
That's called
self-determination.

34:49.421 --> 34:51.723
Maybe this is just
the wrong place for me.

34:53.692 --> 34:55.093
Mm.

34:56.762 --> 34:59.598
Fortune must be enticed
to reveal itself.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.869
Just gotta open your heart
and have fun.

35:04.102 --> 35:06.171
That's the point anyway,
isn't it?

35:15.180 --> 35:17.115
Now,
before we start tonight...

35:18.584 --> 35:20.519
I got something important
I wanna say.

35:21.386 --> 35:25.724
Little secret I found out about
my very own valet, Crystal.

35:26.391 --> 35:28.393
Yeah, that's right, Crystal.

35:28.427 --> 35:31.230
I know you've been
sneaking around behind my back

35:31.263 --> 35:32.764
with Bobby Pin.

35:32.798 --> 35:34.399
-That's sad.
-What?

35:34.433 --> 35:35.868
You thought
I wouldn't find out?

35:35.901 --> 35:37.669
That you could just
play both sides

35:37.703 --> 35:39.471
till one of us
was crowned champ

35:39.505 --> 35:41.139
and you'd make your decision

35:41.173 --> 35:43.275
and claim your spot
on the throne as queen?

35:44.142 --> 35:45.811
I made you what you are!

35:45.844 --> 35:47.613
And you repay me with this?

35:47.646 --> 35:49.314
Hey, you missed
coming out with the photos.

35:50.749 --> 35:52.417
You filthy piece
of trailer trash!

35:52.451 --> 35:54.386
I pulled you out of the dump!

35:54.419 --> 35:56.255
Now I'm sending you back
to that rat's nest

35:56.288 --> 35:57.890
so you can hustle tricks
as a cam girl

35:57.923 --> 35:59.691
till you wind up dead!

36:00.692 --> 36:02.661
-That was good, Dad.
-Thank you, buddy.

36:02.694 --> 36:06.765
Uh, can you run on downstairs,
grab us a few Cokes, please?

36:06.798 --> 36:08.333
Thank you.

36:09.368 --> 36:10.536
Hey,

36:10.569 --> 36:11.904
we gotta ratchet it back
real quick

36:11.937 --> 36:14.673
with the whole "rot till you're
dead, cam girl" stuff.

36:15.541 --> 36:16.675
But I'm a heel now.

36:16.708 --> 36:18.277
I'm not supposed to care
about her feelings.

36:18.310 --> 36:20.312
The lines I wrote will
turn the audience against her.

36:20.345 --> 36:22.948
Just say the lines I wrote.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.683
It's a family show.

36:25.717 --> 36:27.486
Hey, Battle Royal's heating up.

36:27.519 --> 36:29.388
Main event in moments.
Places, fellas.

36:34.826 --> 36:35.827
Ah!

36:46.271 --> 36:49.541
-How do they not get hurt?
-Every one of them on drugs.

37:00.686 --> 37:02.955
How have I never been
to one of these before?

37:02.988 --> 37:04.590
This is awesome.

37:05.524 --> 37:07.626
Hey, good luck, everyone.
Let's crush it.

37:10.495 --> 37:12.464
Something you wanna say?

37:12.497 --> 37:14.232
I just know a place
you can get your roots done

37:14.266 --> 37:16.301
where your hair
won't look so bleached.

37:16.335 --> 37:17.402
Mm.

37:18.503 --> 37:19.805
-I was trying to be helpful!
-Hey, ladies.

37:19.838 --> 37:22.274
-Okay, okay, ladies.
-Hey, get the fuck off her.

37:22.307 --> 37:23.842
-I was trying to help, man.
-Help yourself, man.

37:23.875 --> 37:25.877
Hey! Cool it, God damn it.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.684
You're not seriously crying,
right?

37:32.718 --> 37:34.586
You shut your fucking mouth
or I'll shut it for you.

37:38.023 --> 37:40.258
There. That should hold.

37:42.861 --> 37:44.329
Hey.

37:46.832 --> 37:48.900
-Are we all good?
-Yeah.

37:53.271 --> 37:54.840
What are they doing?

37:56.975 --> 37:58.343
Hey, Rooster.

37:59.845 --> 38:01.780
Rooster! Rooster!

38:01.813 --> 38:03.448
Rooster! Rooster!

38:03.482 --> 38:04.916
Rooster! Rooster!

38:04.950 --> 38:07.052
Rooster! Rooster!

38:07.285 --> 38:08.687
-Rooster! Rooster!
-Come on, man.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.422
Do it.

38:10.455 --> 38:11.923
-Rooster! Rooster!
-No.

38:11.957 --> 38:13.558
Rooster! Rooster!

38:23.635 --> 38:24.670
You sure?

38:36.848 --> 38:39.618
Yeah, baby, whoo!

38:48.393 --> 38:50.862
You had me worried
there for a second.

38:50.896 --> 38:52.864
Thought y'all
were gonna throw Diego out.

38:52.898 --> 38:56.101
Hey, I need to let you
improvise more, okay?

38:56.334 --> 38:58.570
Admitted. Crowd loved it.

39:00.105 --> 39:01.073
What's my name?

39:01.106 --> 39:02.541
Rooster.

39:02.574 --> 39:04.876
What's my real name?

39:09.347 --> 39:11.583
Deandre Milton Rutherford.

39:13.051 --> 39:15.020
I know your legal name
because I pay you by check

39:15.053 --> 39:16.988
and I give you a 1099.

39:17.022 --> 39:19.391
You go by Dee to your family

39:19.424 --> 39:21.059
and you go by DA
to your friends,

39:21.093 --> 39:22.728
which I know because
you're always talking

39:22.761 --> 39:26.031
with your fucking speakerphone
on in the locker room.

39:26.064 --> 39:29.601
And like I said,
your stage name is Rooster.

39:30.769 --> 39:32.738
Now, I know that things
have been crazy around here,

39:32.771 --> 39:34.139
but please, please, please,

39:34.372 --> 39:36.441
do not make me out
to be somebody that I'm not.

39:36.475 --> 39:38.410
I'm not a man
who doesn't know your name.

39:38.443 --> 39:39.711
I know all four of them,

39:39.745 --> 39:42.514
and I'll call you any one
that you want me to.

39:42.547 --> 39:46.017
Tonight was about respect,
recognition,

39:46.051 --> 39:48.954
and success for everyone here,
which clearly includes you.

39:48.987 --> 39:50.555
So this time tomorrow,

39:50.589 --> 39:52.090
if there's anything
that I can do

39:52.124 --> 39:53.625
to alleviate these frustrations

39:53.658 --> 39:56.661
that you're clearly having,
I will try.

39:56.695 --> 39:59.498
And your moment in the sun
is gon' come.

40:00.832 --> 40:02.701
Thank you very much
for your work tonight.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.002
You crushed.

40:05.003 --> 40:07.472
All right. Hey!

40:07.506 --> 40:09.074
-There he is. Yeah, D!

40:09.107 --> 40:12.110
-Way to go, brother!

40:13.044 --> 40:16.448
-Yee!
-Yeah, D!

40:22.587 --> 40:24.523
What is a cage match?

40:24.556 --> 40:27.993
I looked it up.
First one who climbs out wins.

40:33.965 --> 40:36.434
Jack, you're on.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.176
Good luck, babe.

40:50.148 --> 40:51.983
Hey, Ace.

40:53.552 --> 40:54.786
Photos are in here.

40:54.820 --> 40:57.088
Thanks.

41:59.251 --> 42:01.620
Now,
before we get started,

42:01.653 --> 42:03.521
I got something important
I want--

42:03.555 --> 42:05.624
I have a confession to make.

42:07.626 --> 42:09.761
Ace Spade...

42:09.794 --> 42:11.696
I been cheating on you
with Bobby Pin.

42:15.200 --> 42:17.736
But that's not my confession.

42:17.769 --> 42:20.272
My confession is

42:20.305 --> 42:22.741
I'm not the least bit sorry
about it.

42:27.846 --> 42:30.916
The thing is, Ace,
you can't satisfy me.

42:33.685 --> 42:37.122
I need a man,
not a crybaby boy.

42:39.925 --> 42:41.960
But hey, don't worry.

42:41.993 --> 42:44.095
You're so lucky

42:44.129 --> 42:46.031
'cause sometimes,

42:46.064 --> 42:49.167
you find someone
more pathetic than you.

42:52.137 --> 42:54.272
Hey, uh, Tricia, you know
I'm talking about you.

42:54.306 --> 42:55.974
Get that bony behind out here.

42:58.209 --> 43:00.879
Think that's your cue,
sweetheart.

43:00.912 --> 43:02.948
Did she just say
I have a bony behind?

43:02.981 --> 43:04.215
Take it as a compliment.

43:04.249 --> 43:05.784
It'll expand eventually.

43:05.817 --> 43:07.319
Move it!

43:07.352 --> 43:09.187
-Jesus.

43:09.220 --> 43:13.725
Folks, I wanna
introduce y'all to Tricia.

43:15.060 --> 43:16.995
There she is.

43:22.167 --> 43:23.335
Now, hold on.

43:23.368 --> 43:26.237
Now, I'm thankful for this--
this little lady,

43:26.271 --> 43:28.073
because this here girl,

43:28.106 --> 43:31.343
she don't mind reaching over
across the bed at night

43:31.376 --> 43:33.712
to find not a man...

43:35.046 --> 43:37.315
...but a whimpering shell
of a man.

43:46.358 --> 43:48.193
I'm sorry, Ace.
Did you want the mic?

43:48.226 --> 43:49.361
I'm all done.

43:50.795 --> 43:52.931
Well, one last thing, I guess.

43:53.932 --> 43:55.166
We're over.

43:55.200 --> 43:56.634
Ooh!

43:56.668 --> 43:57.969
I'm with Bobby now.

44:01.272 --> 44:05.043
Let the night roar!

44:13.318 --> 44:16.054
Yeah, break another mic.
Why not?

44:16.087 --> 44:18.289
Hey, Thomas, when you grow up,
do one thing for me.

44:18.323 --> 44:20.358
Don't become a fucking idiot
like these guys.

44:20.392 --> 44:22.327
-Got it.
-Shit.

44:29.801 --> 44:32.804
Get out of the ring now!

44:34.139 --> 44:37.042
She is off script.
She never goes off script.

44:37.075 --> 44:38.443
What did you say to her?

44:38.676 --> 44:40.045
What the fuck
is this shit, man?

44:40.078 --> 44:41.913
Hey-hey, get to your corner.

44:41.946 --> 44:44.349
Stick with your spots.
We'll deal with it later.

44:44.382 --> 44:46.284
I just told her she has talent

44:46.317 --> 44:48.686
and the world needs to see it.

44:48.720 --> 44:51.122
Thankfully, Debbie,
we live in an age

44:51.156 --> 44:53.425
where all it takes
to get a woman to act boldly

44:53.458 --> 44:56.127
is to tell her
the time has come for change

44:56.161 --> 44:58.163
and she's the one
who should change it.

45:21.786 --> 45:24.222
Hey, too much movement.

45:27.192 --> 45:29.327
Oh, Ace, easy!

45:31.162 --> 45:33.164
Ace!

45:38.169 --> 45:39.904
It's too much

45:39.938 --> 45:41.139
Hey, hey.

45:42.941 --> 45:44.175
Dude, take it easy, man.

45:44.209 --> 45:45.910
Reverse.

45:49.414 --> 45:51.282
Let's go! Whoo!

45:57.922 --> 45:59.791
Yeah, buddy, that's it!

46:22.981 --> 46:24.215
Whoo!

46:26.918 --> 46:28.186
Climb the cage.

46:28.219 --> 46:30.188
Superplex.

46:31.156 --> 46:33.791
Ace, hey, hey,
you never done that.

46:33.825 --> 46:35.126
You never done that.

46:35.160 --> 46:36.427
What the...

46:39.797 --> 46:41.132
Bobby, come on!

46:41.166 --> 46:42.400
Hey, calm down.

46:42.433 --> 46:44.569
Ace, I haven't
done this before, man.

46:44.802 --> 46:47.005
Don't be a fucking pussy.

46:55.446 --> 46:57.215
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

46:57.248 --> 46:59.050
You do not
get to change things.

47:05.490 --> 47:07.959
Ow, Ace! Ow!

47:11.029 --> 47:12.564
Bobby, tap!

47:12.597 --> 47:15.133
Hey!

47:15.166 --> 47:18.136
Ace, that's really tight, man.
It hurts, man. Ace!

47:18.169 --> 47:20.572
-Ace?
-Tap, tap, tap.

47:20.605 --> 47:22.273
Hey, Ace, what the fuck?

47:23.575 --> 47:26.244
Ow! Ace! Don't do it, man!

47:34.419 --> 47:37.088
Shit. Hey. Now, now, now, now.

47:38.189 --> 47:39.424
That means he's really hurt.

47:39.457 --> 47:40.458
Stretcher, now.

47:43.294 --> 47:46.097
Stay there. Stay down.

47:46.130 --> 47:48.866
That's what happens
when you mess with Ace Spade!

47:53.871 --> 47:55.974
We got it, dude.
Breathe, breathe.

47:56.007 --> 47:58.009
-Lay down.

47:58.042 --> 47:59.444
Come on.

48:02.914 --> 48:04.015
Careful, now.

48:08.186 --> 48:11.489
It's gonna be okay.

48:11.522 --> 48:13.491
Ow!

48:52.297 --> 48:55.066
Take deep breaths, my man.

48:55.099 --> 48:56.634
Here we go. All right.
Slow it down here.

48:56.668 --> 48:58.503
Slow it down.

48:58.536 --> 49:00.405
Ambulance. It's bad.

49:00.438 --> 49:01.673
Bobby, we got you.

49:01.706 --> 49:03.541
Hey, Jack. Jack.

49:03.574 --> 49:05.176
I hope the people from the fair
still like what we did, man.

49:05.209 --> 49:06.611
-I'm really sorry, man.
-Hey, hey.

49:06.644 --> 49:08.446
Don't you worry.
We gon' fix you right up.

49:08.479 --> 49:09.547
-Okay, man.
-We're gonna fix you--

49:09.580 --> 49:11.616
Oh, my Lord.

49:11.649 --> 49:15.086
I look around at the fear
in your faces

49:15.119 --> 49:16.954
and I want y'all to know

49:16.988 --> 49:20.158
I, too, am horrified
by what I seen here tonight.

49:20.558 --> 49:23.661
Injury so horrifying...

49:25.563 --> 49:27.231
...yet so avoidable.

49:28.633 --> 49:32.570
But apparently,
that's what the DWL has become

49:32.603 --> 49:34.372
in King Spade's absence.

49:34.405 --> 49:36.240
Hey, Jack, take it easy, man.
It's not worth it.

49:36.274 --> 49:37.442
-Fuck!
-Dad?

49:37.475 --> 49:38.643
As most of y'all know,

49:38.676 --> 49:40.745
recently, I parted ways

49:40.978 --> 49:43.014
with the Big Show up north.

49:46.984 --> 49:51.055
Wanted to come home to Duffy
and slow things down.

49:53.024 --> 49:56.728
Enjoy the three Fs,
as I like to call 'em--

49:56.761 --> 50:01.366
food, fishin', and fornicatin'.

50:04.736 --> 50:08.106
But that was before
I got a whiff

50:08.139 --> 50:11.109
of what the Spade boys
been up to.

50:11.142 --> 50:14.212
Now, me and King Tom, we may
have had our differences,

50:14.245 --> 50:18.583
but the one thing Tom
always had was my respect.

50:20.051 --> 50:22.487
Now I see his boys,

50:22.520 --> 50:25.390
and they are making
a mockery of his legacy,

50:25.423 --> 50:28.493
razing the house he built
with his own two hands!

50:32.196 --> 50:34.499
A month ago, Jack here
humiliated his brother

50:34.532 --> 50:36.033
in the ring.

50:36.067 --> 50:39.470
And now Ace has just injured

50:39.504 --> 50:42.106
and possibly ruined the career
of a fellow wrestler.

50:42.140 --> 50:44.475
-The DWL belt...

50:44.509 --> 50:45.743
-Motherfucker.
-...Belongs

50:45.777 --> 50:49.280
to neither of these boys!

50:49.313 --> 50:51.716
They haven't earned it.

50:51.749 --> 50:53.418
They don't deserve it.

50:53.451 --> 50:55.453
It's time to right this ship.

50:57.522 --> 50:59.190
Somebody get me the belt

50:59.223 --> 51:00.691
and get me
a goddamn microphone!

51:00.725 --> 51:02.160
Someone's gotta do it

51:02.193 --> 51:06.230
and it might as well be
Wild Bill Hancock!

51:08.833 --> 51:13.404
And that's why I've decided
to challenge Jack and Ace

51:13.438 --> 51:16.407
for the DWL Championship belt

51:16.441 --> 51:18.609
in a three-way ladder match.

51:18.643 --> 51:20.178
Come on!

51:29.353 --> 51:30.455
What you think, Jack?

51:30.488 --> 51:32.190
You got something
you want to say to me?

51:32.223 --> 51:34.392
Hey, Bill. You make me laugh.

51:34.425 --> 51:36.360
You came back here
for your roots?

51:36.394 --> 51:39.096
You came back here because
the folks up north realized

51:39.130 --> 51:40.698
what I've known
for a long time.

51:40.731 --> 51:44.302
You're a drunken has-been
who's got no place in that ring

51:44.335 --> 51:46.103
just like you got
no place in mine.

51:46.137 --> 51:49.140
Now, if you're gonna make me
teach you that the hard way,

51:49.173 --> 51:50.308
so be it.

51:50.341 --> 51:51.709
I'll give you your shot.

51:51.742 --> 51:55.379
We can go up in the ring.
You can pretend like it's 1995.

51:55.413 --> 51:57.448
But you are not gonna
walk out of there.

51:57.482 --> 51:58.816
No, sir.

51:58.850 --> 52:02.186
And if y'all want this belt
on the line, then so be it.

52:02.220 --> 52:03.855
I'll put the belt on the line.

52:03.888 --> 52:06.858
But you got no chance,
none whatsoever,

52:06.891 --> 52:09.360
'cause this belt
is staying right here

52:09.393 --> 52:10.828
in my hands!

53:22.466 --> 53:23.734
Jack.

53:26.203 --> 53:28.806
Hey, buddy, why don't you go
to the gift shop?

53:28.839 --> 53:30.608
Get yourself a candy bar.

53:30.641 --> 53:32.276
But Mom would be mad.

53:32.310 --> 53:33.511
I'll take care of your mom.

53:33.544 --> 53:34.545
Go on.

53:39.550 --> 53:41.218
-You just did the one thing--
-Hey, hey--

53:41.252 --> 53:42.653
You did the one thing that
you cannot fucking do.

53:42.687 --> 53:44.488
It was an accident, Jack.

53:44.522 --> 53:46.824
I swear to God
it was an accident, okay?

53:46.857 --> 53:48.292
Bobby isn't experienced.

53:48.326 --> 53:49.961
I didn't want him to go
in the ring so early.

53:49.994 --> 53:51.362
-Shut up, Ace.
-You know what? I had--

53:51.395 --> 53:52.997
Shut the fuck up! Hey!

53:55.433 --> 53:57.702
You understand now
why I made you a heel?

53:57.735 --> 53:59.437
'Cause you're a fucking
piece of shit.

53:59.470 --> 54:00.504
Fuck you.

54:01.939 --> 54:04.408
Jack. Jack!

54:08.346 --> 54:10.648
Thank you so much
for coming out.

54:10.681 --> 54:11.716
Yeah.

54:11.749 --> 54:13.451
Yeah, yeah,
let me get you Jack.

54:13.484 --> 54:14.685
Hold on just a minute.

54:19.924 --> 54:22.393
It's Jack.

54:22.426 --> 54:24.495
Oh, hey there.

54:24.528 --> 54:25.763
Oh, yeah, that's part
of the fun.

54:25.796 --> 54:28.566
Audience never knows
what's real.

54:28.599 --> 54:29.867
Bob--Bobby Pin
does do a great job

54:29.900 --> 54:31.769
of selling the pain,
that's for sure.

54:32.970 --> 54:35.473
Well, Wild- Wild Bill's
a star for a reason.

54:35.506 --> 54:38.509
His uh, his persona is unique.

54:41.612 --> 54:43.948
All right, we'll uh,
we'll touch base tomorrow.

54:43.981 --> 54:45.583
Thank you.

54:49.053 --> 54:51.656
Look, I know you got
a lot on your plate,

54:51.689 --> 54:53.958
but your son's got no idea
what the fuck is going on,

54:53.991 --> 54:55.559
and he's scared senseless.

54:57.428 --> 54:59.764
You don't talk to him soon,
I'm calling Staci.

54:59.797 --> 55:00.898
Willie.

55:04.435 --> 55:06.704
We got the fair.

55:08.439 --> 55:09.740
Okay.
