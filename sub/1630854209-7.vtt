<i>Previously on</i> East New York...

00:04.204 --> 00:05.572
KILLIAN:<i> Back when I was on</i>
<i>the Warrant Squad with Desmond,</i>

00:05.638 --> 00:06.506
his gut told him
the Selkirk Brothers

00:06.573 --> 00:07.907
had gone out of state,

00:07.974 --> 00:10.176
but First Grade Detective Troy
here didn't

00:10.243 --> 00:11.644
want to exceed the overtime cap.

00:11.711 --> 00:13.113
By the time we picked them up,
they'd killed, what,

00:13.179 --> 00:14.114
two more people?

00:14.180 --> 00:16.116
(shouting, clamoring)

00:16.182 --> 00:17.450
How'd your homicide go?

00:17.517 --> 00:18.785
I'm here for a divorce.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.487
Oh.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.487
And because she works

00:20.553 --> 00:22.922
in Manhattan South, guess
who's getting transferred?

00:22.989 --> 00:24.958
I also want
members of the service

00:25.024 --> 00:26.993
<i>to start living</i>
<i>near where they work.</i>

00:27.060 --> 00:28.528
No one wants you here.

00:28.595 --> 00:29.929
You're a nuisance.

00:29.996 --> 00:33.032
Ticketing us like criminals
in our homes.

00:33.099 --> 00:34.667
Leave.

00:34.734 --> 00:38.405
Every single person
in this building is important.

00:38.471 --> 00:40.874
Okay, let's take it for a spin.

00:40.940 --> 00:43.576
(rumbling)

00:40.940 --> 00:43.576
What the hell was that?

00:48.081 --> 00:49.949
Oh, my goodness.

00:50.016 --> 00:51.384

HAYWOOD:
How is it?

01:03.997 --> 01:05.098
It's good.

01:05.165 --> 01:06.699
You know, I'm
generally suspect

01:06.766 --> 01:09.469
of meat substitutes, in
this case prosciutto, but

01:09.536 --> 01:12.138
the edible enrobing of
the fig is, it's good.

01:12.205 --> 01:15.408
Green Gro Organic Supermarket
is committed

01:15.475 --> 01:17.210
to bringing healthy,
organic food

01:17.277 --> 01:19.078
to underserved communities.

01:19.145 --> 01:20.713
So it is with great pleasure

01:20.780 --> 01:22.382
that we open
an East New York branch

01:22.449 --> 01:24.551
to sell only the
healthiest produce,

01:24.617 --> 01:26.553
meat and prepared foods
available.

01:26.619 --> 01:28.855
Ready?

01:26.619 --> 01:28.855
WOMAN:
Yeah.

01:30.590 --> 01:33.593
(all clapping)

01:35.862 --> 01:37.363
I thought you
didn't eat pork.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.799
Sandeford,
it's turkey bacon.

01:39.866 --> 01:42.802
I said I don't eat animals
that come when you call them.

01:42.869 --> 01:44.471
A turkey will come
when you call them.

01:44.537 --> 01:46.072
BENTLEY: No, they don't.

01:44.537 --> 01:46.072
SANDEFORD:
Anything you feed will come

01:46.139 --> 01:47.474
when you call them.
That's animals, kids,

01:47.540 --> 01:49.342
in-laws or cops.

01:49.409 --> 01:51.010
(gun shots)

01:49.409 --> 01:51.010
(woman screams)

01:51.077 --> 01:53.513
BENTLEY:
7-4 George to Central.
10-85, shots fired.

01:53.580 --> 01:55.515
Need additional units.

01:57.116 --> 01:58.785
It's okay.

02:03.089 --> 02:04.491
(panting)

02:04.557 --> 02:07.260
Whoa, whoa, stop right there!

02:04.557 --> 02:07.260
I think some guy

02:07.327 --> 02:09.195
just shot up the place.
I think he's still here.

02:09.262 --> 02:11.664
Where here?

02:09.262 --> 02:11.664
Uh, out back
by the loading dock.

02:11.731 --> 02:13.399
Down on your knees.

02:11.731 --> 02:13.399
Wait, what?

02:13.466 --> 02:14.767
I said get down
on your knees!

02:14.834 --> 02:16.002
Put your hands up
where I can see them!

02:16.069 --> 02:17.837
7-4 George get a bus
down here forthwith.

02:17.904 --> 02:20.240
And show me with one under.

02:20.306 --> 02:22.075
Sandeford?

02:20.306 --> 02:22.075
Check out her right arm.

02:22.141 --> 02:24.477
What? Why are you
doing this to me?!

02:24.544 --> 02:26.479
It's blood from the
guy she just shot.

02:26.546 --> 02:27.780
I'm glad you noticed that,
Officer.

02:27.847 --> 02:29.315
That's what a good cop does.

02:29.382 --> 02:31.651
Are you calling me
a good cop, boss?

02:29.382 --> 02:31.651
Yeah.

02:31.718 --> 02:33.486
Something like that.

02:31.718 --> 02:33.486
Right on.

02:33.553 --> 02:35.021
BENTLEY:
Inspector?

02:35.088 --> 02:36.356
(moaning)

02:36.422 --> 02:38.892
7-4, C.O. put a rush on the bus.

02:38.958 --> 02:41.494
Got an ambulance
coming, okay?

02:41.561 --> 02:44.063
(indistinct chatter)

02:45.198 --> 02:47.300
(horns honking)

02:47.367 --> 02:49.569
What kind of music is Corinne
gonna be playing at the bar?

02:49.636 --> 02:51.437
Are you about to tell me
she should have

02:51.504 --> 02:53.706
Spanish music playing
at the bar?

02:53.773 --> 02:55.842
Willie Colón, Eddie Palmieri.
Old school.

02:55.909 --> 02:57.343
You know,
she's hemorrhaging money.

02:57.410 --> 02:58.778
She's got a convict for a chef.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.313
And you're worried
about what kind of music

03:00.380 --> 03:02.048
she's gonna be playing
at the bar. (clicks tongue)

03:02.115 --> 03:03.449
'Cause you're not taking
enough of an interest

03:03.516 --> 03:04.918
in it, that's why.

03:04.984 --> 03:06.686
We got the perp
from the supermarket shooting.

03:06.753 --> 03:08.087
Oh, yeah?

03:06.753 --> 03:08.087
She asked to speak

03:08.154 --> 03:09.455
to Detective Morales,
said she knows you.

03:09.522 --> 03:10.790
A lot of perps know me.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.325
She asked to say hello.

03:12.392 --> 03:14.694
Tell her... I'm out somewhere.

03:14.761 --> 03:16.496
KILLIAN:
See, I don't
think you're...

03:16.563 --> 03:19.032
taking enough interest in this.

03:28.341 --> 03:29.442
Antonia?

03:29.509 --> 03:32.011
I got him, Crystal.

03:32.078 --> 03:33.212
I got him.

03:33.279 --> 03:35.281
(sighs)

03:36.182 --> 03:37.784
MORALES:
<i>It was a year and a half ago.</i>

03:37.850 --> 03:39.452
She came in saying
she'd been raped.

03:39.519 --> 03:41.621
What was the disposition?

03:39.519 --> 03:41.621
Closed.

03:41.688 --> 03:43.022
"Not Amenable."

03:43.089 --> 03:44.991
So it never even went
to the D.A.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.726
Because she met the guy
in a bar,

03:46.793 --> 03:48.628
it's classified
as "acquaintance rape,"

03:48.695 --> 03:50.496
rather than "stranger rape."

03:50.563 --> 03:52.265
Stranger rape takes priority.

03:52.332 --> 03:53.933
Given how many
you're handling at a time,

03:54.000 --> 03:56.703
by the time you get
to acquaintance rape,

03:56.769 --> 03:57.971
just not enough hours
in the day.

03:58.037 --> 03:59.539
I gather it wasn't your decision

03:59.606 --> 04:00.974
to close the case.

03:59.606 --> 04:00.974
No.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.642
It was definitely
not my decision.

04:02.709 --> 04:05.211
Word came
from the C.O.

04:05.278 --> 04:06.980
at SVD.

04:07.046 --> 04:09.716
So you're feeling you owe it
to her to handle it better?

04:09.782 --> 04:12.285
Yeah, I do.

04:13.419 --> 04:16.522
You want to connect that rape
to this shooting...

04:17.490 --> 04:19.926
...do it.

04:17.490 --> 04:19.926
Thanks, boss.

04:22.528 --> 04:24.063
(door opens)

04:24.130 --> 04:26.099
♪ ♪

04:26.165 --> 04:28.201
(door closes)

04:35.808 --> 04:37.310
Hey.

04:37.377 --> 04:39.145
Captain.

04:37.377 --> 04:39.145
You ever hear the aphorism,

04:39.212 --> 04:40.980
"The past is never dead.

04:41.047 --> 04:43.049
It's not even past"?

04:43.116 --> 04:44.317
Can't say that I have, Captain.

04:44.384 --> 04:45.418
William Faulkner.

04:45.485 --> 04:46.919
I never read William Faulkner.

04:46.986 --> 04:49.022
Me, neither. Tried him once.
It was too dense.

04:49.088 --> 04:51.791
I couldn't follow it.
Anyway, the reason I'm here

04:51.858 --> 04:54.060
is because one of the guns that
was found in the elevator shaft

04:54.127 --> 04:56.696
over at Ruskin Gardens
has been linked to a homicide.

04:56.763 --> 05:00.099
And since you're next
in the catching order,

05:00.166 --> 05:02.301
the investigation
has fallen to you.

05:02.368 --> 05:04.003
(sighs)

05:04.070 --> 05:05.505
This is from 15 years ago.

05:05.571 --> 05:07.140
Ergo, the issue of the past.

05:07.206 --> 05:08.541
Whoa, Captain,

05:08.608 --> 05:09.876
isn't there someone else
you can give this to?

05:09.942 --> 05:11.444
I've got, like,
25 open investigations

05:11.511 --> 05:14.080
staring me in the face.

05:11.511 --> 05:14.080
We have been tasked

05:14.147 --> 05:15.882
with investigating crimes.

05:15.948 --> 05:17.617
And that,
Detective,

05:17.684 --> 05:19.018
is as general and specific

05:19.085 --> 05:21.621
as your understanding
of our purpose needs to be.

05:21.688 --> 05:23.156
Borough Command
is expecting

05:23.222 --> 05:25.058
some sort of report
by the end of the week.

05:25.124 --> 05:26.626
Thank you.

05:25.124 --> 05:26.626
Cap.

05:28.227 --> 05:30.530
Let's go for a ride.

05:31.531 --> 05:33.499
(clears throat)

05:37.904 --> 05:40.540
KILLIAN: It's hell of a day
for this to happen, huh?

05:40.606 --> 05:42.475
Tell me about it.

05:42.542 --> 05:44.477
KILLIAN: So you
didn't see the person

05:44.544 --> 05:46.846
before they shot you?

05:44.544 --> 05:46.846
I didn't see them.

05:46.913 --> 05:48.448
I didn't even know
I'd been shot.

05:46.913 --> 05:48.448
NURSE: I'll be right back.

05:48.514 --> 05:50.383
I just felt this

05:50.450 --> 05:52.385
searing pain in my back.

05:52.452 --> 05:53.920
It was like someone stabbed me.

05:53.986 --> 05:56.622
But you didn't see who it was?

05:53.986 --> 05:56.622
No.

05:56.689 --> 05:58.191
And since it was
the grand opening,

05:58.257 --> 06:00.560
were you on a different
schedule than usual?

06:00.626 --> 06:02.495
I'm always there by 6:00.

06:02.562 --> 06:03.629
Is it possible the shooter
knew your schedule?

06:03.696 --> 06:05.031
If it was me she was after.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.766
So it was a woman.

06:06.833 --> 06:08.501
I don't know
if it was a woman.

06:08.568 --> 06:09.969
I'm just saying
it wasn't about me.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.205
Yeah? What do you
think it was about?

06:12.271 --> 06:13.906
Someone delusional,

06:13.973 --> 06:15.575
marginalized...

06:15.641 --> 06:18.111
filled with rage
in a crowded city.

06:18.177 --> 06:20.346
That's what accounts for most
random acts of violence.

06:20.413 --> 06:23.015
So there's no one you can think
of that would want to hurt you?

06:23.082 --> 06:25.918
Did I cut someone off
on the expressway?

06:25.985 --> 06:28.287
I might have.
I'm not a very good driver.

06:28.354 --> 06:30.523
KILLIAN: What about the
people that work for you?

06:30.590 --> 06:32.992
Have you had
to fire anyone recently?

06:33.059 --> 06:34.961
Can I let you in
on a little secret?

06:35.027 --> 06:37.063
I never fire
anyone.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.866
It's one of the reasons I was
never made regional manager.

06:39.932 --> 06:41.334
Too soft.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.935
Well...

06:43.002 --> 06:45.938
just so you know,
we have a suspect in custody.

06:46.005 --> 06:49.542
Does the name Antonia
Ortiz ring a bell?

06:49.609 --> 06:52.311
I dated a woman named
Antonia Ortiz.

06:52.378 --> 06:54.380
If it's the same one.

06:54.447 --> 06:56.649
What could you
tell us about her?

06:56.716 --> 06:57.784
It's not like I really
know her, you know?

06:57.850 --> 06:59.085
We only went out
once or twice.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.286
From what I remember,
she was nuts.

07:00.353 --> 07:02.021
Nuts how?

07:02.088 --> 07:03.790
I don't know
if she's actually bi-polar,

07:03.856 --> 07:06.759
but she flip-flops
from one thing to another.

07:06.826 --> 07:09.562
Affectionate
one minute.

07:10.530 --> 07:13.633
Revolted by my very existence
the next.

07:15.468 --> 07:17.203
Well, when you're
feeling up to it,

07:17.270 --> 07:19.772
we're gonna need you to pick
her out of some photographs.

07:19.839 --> 07:21.140
Sure.

07:19.839 --> 07:21.140
Then if it goes

07:21.207 --> 07:23.776
to trial, they're gonna
need you to testify.

07:23.843 --> 07:26.813
Meantime you've got
her locked up?

07:26.879 --> 07:28.014
Mm-hmm.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.215
Good.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.583
Keep her that way.

07:30.650 --> 07:32.552
Yeah, you got it.

07:38.391 --> 07:40.426
He's lying.

07:38.391 --> 07:40.426
He might be lying.

07:40.493 --> 07:42.795
The doctor said the entry
wound was from the front.

07:42.862 --> 07:44.564
He said he felt like he'd
been stabbed in the back.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.199
Well, it's possible there's
sensory confusion,

07:46.265 --> 07:47.600
given the circumstances.

07:47.667 --> 07:49.335
In other words, you
want her to be lying.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.971
Is that right?

07:49.402 --> 07:51.971
I don't want anyone
to be lying, Crystal.

07:52.038 --> 07:53.906
But there's no
corroboration.

07:53.973 --> 07:55.875
No physical evidence.
Okay? We have to allow

07:55.942 --> 07:57.877
for the possibility that
one of them is lying.

07:57.944 --> 08:00.546
Okay, you be sure and keep
that possibility alive.

08:00.613 --> 08:02.748
I don't get why you're so upset.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.851
'Cause there are very few things
that irritate me as much

08:04.917 --> 08:06.986
as excessive even-handedness.

08:07.053 --> 08:08.588
Hey, pardon me?

08:08.654 --> 08:10.423
Before you throw
his bandages away,

08:10.489 --> 08:12.458
can we have that?

08:12.525 --> 08:15.228
It's uh, for an ongoing
investigation.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.637
(clears throat)

08:25.338 --> 08:27.640
I order tuna fish
and I get a roast beef.

08:27.707 --> 08:28.841
Egg salad.

08:28.908 --> 08:31.544
I ordered turkey and Swiss.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.579
Yeah.

08:35.915 --> 08:38.150
You ever been to Primanti's?

08:35.915 --> 08:38.150
Mm-mm.

08:38.217 --> 08:39.452
Great hero sandwiches.

08:39.518 --> 08:41.420
Where is it?

08:39.518 --> 08:41.420
Pittsburgh.

08:41.487 --> 08:44.190
Oh, that's,
that's really helpful.

08:44.257 --> 08:46.259
Don't-don't do that. I'm just
recalling great sandwiches

08:46.325 --> 08:48.261
from the past. I thought
that's what we were doing.

08:48.327 --> 08:49.862
That's not what we're doing.

08:49.929 --> 08:52.131
We were complaining
about these sandwiches.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.200
So, um...

08:54.267 --> 08:55.635
Why were you in Pittsburgh?

08:55.701 --> 08:58.004
I was thinking of going
to Carnegie Mellon.

08:58.070 --> 08:59.705
Really?

08:59.772 --> 09:01.507
(Killian clears throat)

09:01.574 --> 09:03.276
You two are the Eagle Scouts

09:03.342 --> 09:05.344
that found those guns
in the elevator shaft.

09:05.411 --> 09:06.846
Yeah, that was,
that was us.

09:06.913 --> 09:08.648
Yeah, one of them came back
with a body on it.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.483
Darnell "Shuggie" Adams.

09:10.549 --> 09:13.185
Lived in Ruskin Gardens with
a woman named Thora Whitfield.

09:13.252 --> 09:17.623
Found in a dumpster at
the Five Borough Bakery, 2007.

09:17.690 --> 09:19.091
That would qualify as
a cold case, wouldn't it?

09:19.158 --> 09:21.560
Cold as ice,
but I have go through

09:21.627 --> 09:23.796
the motions of opening
an investigation, so...

09:23.863 --> 09:26.132
if either of you hear of
anything that might be relevant,

09:26.198 --> 09:27.833
let me know.

09:26.198 --> 09:27.833
Hey.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.002
I try not to seem
like I moved into the projects

09:30.069 --> 09:32.638
with the sole purpose
of intelligence-gathering.

09:32.705 --> 09:34.273
So don't seem like that.

09:38.377 --> 09:39.812
How am I supposed to seem?

09:39.879 --> 09:42.315
Like a hard-working
young police officer

09:42.381 --> 09:44.850
trying to gain the trust
of the community she lives in.

09:44.917 --> 09:47.420
That's what you are,
Brandy Quinlan.

09:47.486 --> 09:50.122
Same as you, Andre Bentley?

09:50.189 --> 09:51.390
Same as me.

09:51.457 --> 09:54.293
Just one floor down.

09:56.629 --> 09:58.564
(knocking)

09:58.631 --> 10:00.633
Have a minute?

09:58.631 --> 10:00.633
Sure.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.068
I don't believe we've met.

10:02.134 --> 10:03.936
Deputy Inspector Jack Hammond
from Special Victims.

10:04.003 --> 10:05.871
How can I help
you, Jack?

10:05.938 --> 10:07.440
Oh, it seems as though
one of your detectives

10:07.506 --> 10:09.141
used to be one of my detectives.

10:09.208 --> 10:11.010
If you're talking
about Crystal Morales,

10:11.077 --> 10:12.778
I hope you're not asking
for her back.

10:12.845 --> 10:15.648
N... No, I'm definitely
not asking for her back.

10:15.715 --> 10:17.216
Oh.

10:15.715 --> 10:17.216
One of my people

10:17.283 --> 10:18.250
threw up a flare that

10:18.317 --> 10:19.819
she was trying to access files.

10:19.885 --> 10:21.587
Well, there was a shoo-- Please.

10:21.654 --> 10:23.155
Oh, thank you.

10:23.222 --> 10:25.524
There was a shooting at
a supermarket this morning.

10:25.591 --> 10:27.426
I understand
it relates

10:27.493 --> 10:28.728
to a rape investigation

10:28.794 --> 10:30.196
from when she was
at Special Victims.

10:30.262 --> 10:32.098
I'm sure you realize
that Special Victims cases

10:32.164 --> 10:34.633
are of a particularly
sensitive nature.

10:34.700 --> 10:35.935
Absolutely.

10:36.002 --> 10:37.837
Access on a need-to-know basis
only.

10:37.903 --> 10:40.272
Detectives are generally
encouraged to share files.

10:40.339 --> 10:41.841
Depends what they want
to do with them.

10:41.907 --> 10:44.110
Seems to me
that Detective Morales

10:44.176 --> 10:46.078
wants to make Special Victims
out to be negligent

10:46.145 --> 10:48.314
or callous in their treatment
of a rape victim.

10:48.381 --> 10:51.150
No, I don't think that's
what's motivating her at all.

10:52.018 --> 10:53.386
Why don't we bring
the introductory part

10:53.452 --> 10:55.621
of this conversation
to a close, Inspector?

10:55.688 --> 10:58.057
Morales made her feelings
about the men

10:58.124 --> 11:00.326
and women in Special Victims
pretty clear before she left.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.862
But as long as I'm in charge,
they're not gonna be made

11:02.928 --> 11:05.464
into punching bags
for her righteous indignation

11:05.531 --> 11:06.799
that a wobbling

11:06.866 --> 11:08.100
acquaintance rape case
didn't go the distance.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.869
SVD files will not be provided

11:09.935 --> 11:11.837
for Crystal Morales's perusal.

11:11.904 --> 11:13.706
And you can tell her I said so.

11:13.773 --> 11:15.141
I will.

11:16.175 --> 11:18.744
I don't mean to be coming down
on you about this.

11:18.811 --> 11:21.013
No, look, Jack,
it's all right, please.

11:21.080 --> 11:22.381
They promote us
to a command position,

11:22.448 --> 11:24.016
and we're expected
to protect our people,

11:24.083 --> 11:26.152
answer for decisions
that weren't ours to make

11:26.218 --> 11:28.788
and live and die by how
many cases we clear each month.

11:28.854 --> 11:31.390
Yeah. It's...
it's a lot to ask.

11:31.457 --> 11:34.126
You know... Anyway.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.895
It's nice to meet you, Regina.

11:35.961 --> 11:37.063
Oh.

11:37.129 --> 11:38.431
It's nice to meet you,
too, Jack.

11:38.497 --> 11:39.465
Thanks. Take care.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.034
You, too.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.034
Bye-bye.

11:42.101 --> 11:44.070
Bye.

11:53.379 --> 11:56.382
I just had a visit
from your old boss.

11:57.216 --> 11:59.852
He give you his speech
about protecting his people?

11:59.919 --> 12:01.854
He's entitled
to protect the confidentiality

12:01.921 --> 12:03.656
of his case files, Detective.

12:03.722 --> 12:06.358
Protect them from whom?

12:03.722 --> 12:06.358
Especially if there isn't

12:06.425 --> 12:10.329
a legitimate purpose being
served by sifting through them.

12:10.396 --> 12:11.931
But...

12:11.997 --> 12:14.300
I know you wouldn't
be wasting your time

12:14.366 --> 12:15.901
if there weren't.

12:16.902 --> 12:19.505
Rape complaint breakdown
for Brooklyn North

12:19.572 --> 12:22.308
for the past two years.
It's pretty clear

12:22.374 --> 12:24.743
where your old boss wanted
his detectives

12:24.810 --> 12:26.312
to focus their time

12:26.378 --> 12:28.981
and where he didn't.

12:38.891 --> 12:40.392
(sighs)

12:46.699 --> 12:48.767
(exhales)

12:48.834 --> 12:50.369
(laughing)

12:50.436 --> 12:52.671
Detective Desmond Troy.

12:52.738 --> 12:54.507
You lost?

12:54.573 --> 12:56.342
They said they were
short-handed in a couple

12:56.408 --> 12:58.444
precincts in Brooklyn North.
I took a 60-day assignment.

12:58.511 --> 13:00.980
How's Manhattan South Homicide
managing

13:01.046 --> 13:02.214
without you?

13:02.281 --> 13:03.816
I'm out of Manhattan
South Homicide.

13:03.883 --> 13:05.551
Why's that?

13:03.883 --> 13:05.551
My soon-to-be-ex wife
works there.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.454
Oof, that is quite
a drop in class,

13:08.521 --> 13:10.389
going
from Manhattan South Homicide

13:10.456 --> 13:12.691
to a lowly squad detective
in East New York.

13:12.758 --> 13:14.293
Hopefully it's only temporary.

13:12.758 --> 13:14.293
Couldn't be

13:14.360 --> 13:16.061
temporary enough
from where I'm sitting.

13:16.128 --> 13:17.329
Will you two stop?

13:17.396 --> 13:19.198
Us two?

13:17.396 --> 13:19.198
Yeah, you two.

13:19.265 --> 13:21.133
Come on, make nice.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.368
(sighs)

13:22.434 --> 13:23.669
As long as you're
here, Desmond,

13:23.736 --> 13:26.071
how about you take
a case off my hands?

13:26.138 --> 13:27.506
If it's something
you think I can handle.

13:27.573 --> 13:30.276
Oh, sure, sure, sure.
It's a cold case

13:30.342 --> 13:31.610
from 15 years ago.

13:31.677 --> 13:33.279
Some skel who lived
in Ruskin Gardens.

13:33.345 --> 13:34.813
Got a couple of uniforms
living over there.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.016
Might want to start
by talking to them.

13:37.082 --> 13:40.152
See you in the interview room.
I got to hit the head.

13:42.788 --> 13:44.924
You pick the 7-4
just to wind him up?

13:44.990 --> 13:47.226
The fact you were here might've
had something to do with it.

13:47.293 --> 13:49.962
Oh, God, you're one of those.

13:50.029 --> 13:51.664
One of what?

13:53.933 --> 13:56.135
A romantic.
(shudders)

13:57.236 --> 13:58.537
(sighs)

13:58.604 --> 14:00.039
I didn't get him after all?

14:00.105 --> 14:03.108
No, it's lucky for you
all you did was wound him.

14:03.175 --> 14:04.743
I didn't even hurt him
that much.

14:04.810 --> 14:06.612
I'm so stupid.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.647
Antonia...

14:08.714 --> 14:12.251
you're gonna be charged
with attempted murder.

14:12.318 --> 14:14.720
They could put you away
for 15 years.

14:14.787 --> 14:16.755
Had I killed him,
it would have been worth it.

14:16.822 --> 14:17.990
I don't think so.

14:18.057 --> 14:20.292
After the seasons came
once or twice

14:20.359 --> 14:22.595
with you still inside...

14:22.661 --> 14:25.431
I'm sure you'd come to feel
that nothing was worth it.

14:25.497 --> 14:27.833
He changed my life, Crystal.

14:27.900 --> 14:29.935
I was one person

14:30.002 --> 14:32.871
before he did that to me
and I'm another person after.

14:32.938 --> 14:35.007
I believe you.

14:35.074 --> 14:37.109
I know you do.

14:37.176 --> 14:39.812
The one thing that kept me
going was that you believed me.

14:39.878 --> 14:42.214
And I didn't hold it
against you that...

14:42.281 --> 14:43.716
it wasn't enough.

14:43.782 --> 14:46.418
We didn't have
a suspect back then.

14:47.419 --> 14:50.456
Um... how'd you find this guy?

14:52.424 --> 14:54.360
I had stopped going
to the market.

14:54.426 --> 14:56.095
I had stopped doing anything.

14:56.161 --> 14:58.397
One day my nephews
were coming over,

14:58.464 --> 15:01.467
I had to get
some stuff and I...

15:01.533 --> 15:03.202
saw his picture on the wall.

15:03.269 --> 15:05.137
He's a manager there.

15:05.204 --> 15:07.373
I struck up conversation
with someone who worked there,

15:07.439 --> 15:08.674
and she told me
he'd been transferred

15:08.741 --> 15:10.309
to the East New York location.

15:10.376 --> 15:12.878
Who was it you struck up
a conversation with?

15:12.945 --> 15:14.947
Uh, her name was Yolanda Evans.

15:15.014 --> 15:18.417
She was an assistant manager
at the Gowanus store.

15:20.619 --> 15:23.122
Oh, when I saw his picture...

15:23.188 --> 15:25.758
when I finally knew his name...

15:25.824 --> 15:28.927
it's like everything
came into focus.

15:28.994 --> 15:31.764
Suddenly I had
a purpose.

15:33.232 --> 15:34.900
I tracked him.

15:34.967 --> 15:37.703
I knew what time he got to work,
what time he got out.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.339
I read up,
and I got a.38 caliber revolver,

15:40.406 --> 15:42.941
'cause I thought it would have
been easier to handle.

15:43.008 --> 15:45.277
Turns out it wasn't
as easy as I thought.

15:45.344 --> 15:48.314
I took my shot
and just ran.

15:48.380 --> 15:49.915
What did you talk
to Yolanda Evans about?

15:49.982 --> 15:52.151
I told her that I knew him
from college

15:52.217 --> 15:53.752
and I just wanted
to get in touch.

15:55.354 --> 15:56.588
She told me not to trust him.

15:56.655 --> 15:58.557
You might
want to go

15:58.624 --> 16:00.926
a little light with the details

16:00.993 --> 16:03.228
when it's time to
give a statement.

MORALES:
Yolanda Evans?

16:24.116 --> 16:25.050
Yes?

16:25.117 --> 16:26.618
Detective Killian, Morales.

16:26.685 --> 16:29.321
You work here when Reid Kissoon
was the general manager?

16:29.388 --> 16:31.190
I sure did.

16:29.388 --> 16:31.190
How was that?

16:32.091 --> 16:34.360
It was all right.

16:32.091 --> 16:34.360
How good could it be, right?

16:34.426 --> 16:36.161
You here on account
of some woman shot him?

16:36.228 --> 16:37.596
She said you
directed her

16:37.663 --> 16:39.565
to the store that was opening
in East New York.

16:39.631 --> 16:40.999
I didn't know
she was gonna shoot him.

16:41.066 --> 16:42.301
And nobody said you did.

16:42.368 --> 16:43.936
Can you tell us
anything about him?

16:44.002 --> 16:45.571
He was a little pervy.

16:45.637 --> 16:46.972
But as long
as he gave me

16:47.039 --> 16:49.208
halfway decent hours
and kept his hands to himself,

16:49.274 --> 16:50.509
I got along with him.

16:50.576 --> 16:52.344
How was he pervy?

16:52.411 --> 16:54.012
His whole thing

34:00.405 --> 34:01.339
You got it.

34:01.406 --> 34:03.641
(pained grunts)

34:03.708 --> 34:06.911
Tell them you're
officially under arrest.

34:07.712 --> 34:11.682
You can't do this.
Get me my lawyer. Now!

34:16.988 --> 34:19.223
(indistinct radio chatter)

34:27.165 --> 34:30.468
They're gonna take you
over to arraignment.

34:30.535 --> 34:31.702
There'll be a bail hearing.

34:31.769 --> 34:34.672
Given that you're employed,

34:34.739 --> 34:36.040
and you have ties
to the community,

34:36.107 --> 34:37.909
it's possible
they'll release you

34:37.975 --> 34:39.310
on your own recognizance.

34:39.377 --> 34:41.512
Past that,

34:41.579 --> 34:43.080
you need a good lawyer.

34:43.147 --> 34:45.483
Any suggestions?

34:45.550 --> 34:46.884
There's a few I can think of.

34:46.951 --> 34:48.586
They'll bring it to
the court's attention

34:48.653 --> 34:49.954
that you were
in fact raped,

34:50.021 --> 34:52.390
and that your rapist
has been arrested

34:52.457 --> 34:53.858
for a similar crime.

34:53.925 --> 34:56.727
Whether you plead
temporary insanity

34:56.794 --> 34:59.797
or PTSD, there's a chance
you won't have to do

34:59.864 --> 35:01.332
any jail time at all.

35:01.399 --> 35:02.834
A chance.

35:02.900 --> 35:05.636
But-- Uh-- What similar
crime did he commit?

35:06.637 --> 35:08.940
(sighs)

35:11.375 --> 35:13.744
A few months after he raped you,

35:13.811 --> 35:16.013
he raped
another woman.

35:17.482 --> 35:19.617
I'm sure
a thorough investigation

35:19.684 --> 35:21.953
will reveal he raped others.

35:25.022 --> 35:27.225
I know you would have caught him

35:27.291 --> 35:28.559
if they let you, Crystal.

35:28.626 --> 35:32.630
Yeah. I wish that would have
been the case.

35:35.633 --> 35:37.869
(Killian clears throat)

35:39.403 --> 35:43.641
Hey, they have to run her
over to Central Booking.

35:50.848 --> 35:54.085
Hands behind your back.
Thank you.

35:57.922 --> 36:00.625
I'll get you the names
of those lawyers.

36:00.691 --> 36:03.160
Thank you.

36:08.399 --> 36:10.167
(sighs)

36:12.537 --> 36:14.405
How you doing?

36:14.472 --> 36:17.308
Oh, I've been better.

36:30.888 --> 36:32.957
Don't you have a home
to go to?

36:35.226 --> 36:36.160
I guess I do.

36:36.227 --> 36:37.361
Wishing you hadn't volunteered

36:37.428 --> 36:38.529
to move into the projects?

36:38.596 --> 36:40.398
No.

36:40.464 --> 36:43.401
I am wishing I was more
sure of myself, though.

36:43.467 --> 36:46.070
As far as what goes?

36:48.940 --> 36:51.442
You live somewhere,
you find things out.

36:51.509 --> 36:53.077
You know, things that
you would never find out

36:53.144 --> 36:55.246
if you just worked
in that place.

36:55.313 --> 36:57.181
I mean, you get to
know these people

36:57.248 --> 36:59.116
because they're
your neighbors.

36:59.183 --> 37:02.186
So you act like their neighbor,
and then...

37:02.253 --> 37:04.388
you come into
a piece of information,

37:04.455 --> 37:06.257
and you're supposed
to act like a cop.

37:06.324 --> 37:08.292
Figure out who killed
Shuggie Adams?

37:10.828 --> 37:14.365
I figured out that
where his body was dumped

37:14.432 --> 37:18.302
makes it seem likely that one
of those neighbors killed him.

37:18.369 --> 37:21.005
You know, I locked up Shuggie
Adams two or three times.

37:21.072 --> 37:24.241
And I also think I got
a pretty good idea who shot him.

37:26.844 --> 37:29.480
We make these
decisions every day

37:29.547 --> 37:32.450
about who we bring in
and who we let go.

37:32.516 --> 37:34.118
That's the job.

37:34.185 --> 37:35.486
Yeah, and no one
tells us that

37:35.553 --> 37:36.721
these are our decisions to make,

37:36.787 --> 37:38.689
but sometimes they are.

37:38.756 --> 37:40.625
That's right,
sometimes they are.

37:40.691 --> 37:43.227
So how do you know?

37:43.294 --> 37:46.364
How do you know that
you've made the right decision?

37:46.430 --> 37:48.399
When I sleep good at night.

37:51.569 --> 37:54.972
I want to do right
by Ruskin Gardens, Marvin.

37:55.039 --> 37:58.009
I... I want me being there

37:58.075 --> 38:00.978
to be a good thing.

38:01.045 --> 38:03.514
Then ask yourself
who are you working for?

38:03.581 --> 38:07.918
I saw what Shuggie Adams did
to all the people around him.

38:07.985 --> 38:10.921
And I promise you,
it's a better place

38:10.988 --> 38:12.323
with him gone.

38:12.390 --> 38:14.825
Wait, wait, wait.
You didn't tell me--

38:14.892 --> 38:16.360
You didn't tell me
what to do.

38:16.427 --> 38:17.628
Oh, yeah, I did.

38:17.695 --> 38:19.130
TROY:
How you doing, Officer?

38:19.196 --> 38:21.465
Marvin Sandeford.

38:19.196 --> 38:21.465
Desmond Troy.

38:21.532 --> 38:23.367
SANDEFORD:
You working out of
the Squad here?

38:23.434 --> 38:25.102
For the time being.

38:25.169 --> 38:27.271
Officer Quinlan found guns
in an elevator shaft.

38:27.338 --> 38:28.806
Now I got a 15-year-old
homicide to work.

38:28.873 --> 38:30.041
If it ain't one thing
it's two, huh?

38:30.107 --> 38:31.308
TROY: (laughs)
That's right.

38:31.375 --> 38:34.478
Anything come to light
about that homicide?

38:37.782 --> 38:40.384
No. I-I put some feelers out,
but nothing came back.

38:40.451 --> 38:44.488
Yeah, I kind of figured
nothing would.

38:59.537 --> 39:01.172
Detective.

38:59.537 --> 39:01.172
Chief.

39:01.238 --> 39:03.841
Please. Uh, thanks for
coming down here.

39:03.908 --> 39:05.643
I know it's been a long day.

39:05.710 --> 39:07.178
Am I in trouble?

39:07.244 --> 39:08.546
Not as far as I'm concerned.

39:08.612 --> 39:09.780
She in any kind of trouble
with you, Regina?

39:09.847 --> 39:10.881
Far from it.

39:10.948 --> 39:12.550
So, then, why am I here?

39:12.616 --> 39:14.952
I don't usually get summoned

39:15.019 --> 39:17.154
to the Borough
Commander's office.

39:17.221 --> 39:19.557
It took guts to do
what you did, Detective.

39:19.623 --> 39:21.125
I've seen how you work.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.094
I know how frustrated
you must have been

39:23.160 --> 39:25.930
at Special Victims.

39:23.160 --> 39:25.930
That's why I left.

39:25.996 --> 39:29.433
Detective, the job
doesn't appreciate

39:29.500 --> 39:31.068
having its failures held up
to the light of day.

39:31.135 --> 39:33.537
Which means sometimes
they shoot the messenger.

39:33.604 --> 39:36.741
Want to propose something
to you, Detective.

39:36.807 --> 39:38.409
And I want you
to understand

39:38.476 --> 39:41.612
you are free to decline
this proposition.

39:41.679 --> 39:42.847
I understand.

39:42.913 --> 39:44.615
I have a friend
over at DOJ

39:44.682 --> 39:46.817
whom I've known for a long time.

39:46.884 --> 39:49.120
If an investigation
into the practices

39:49.186 --> 39:51.188
over at Special Victims
is warranted,

39:51.255 --> 39:54.792
there is no one who I would
trust more to conduct it.

39:54.859 --> 39:57.027
HAYWOOD:
It's possible talking to them

39:57.094 --> 39:58.395
might not be
a good career move.

39:58.462 --> 40:00.731
Is that the kind of thing
you'd worry about?

40:00.798 --> 40:02.266
I'm in a different position.

40:02.333 --> 40:03.968
You weren't always in
a different position, Inspector.

40:04.034 --> 40:06.170
SUAREZ:
No, she wasn't.

40:11.308 --> 40:14.879
I'll talk to whoever you think
I should talk to.

40:23.587 --> 40:25.556
I thought we were
doing this together.

40:25.623 --> 40:27.291
Oh, no, we are.

40:27.358 --> 40:29.160
Okay.

40:35.032 --> 40:36.934
Do you think
that we made a mistake?

40:37.001 --> 40:39.370
By agreeing to shovel mulch?

40:37.001 --> 40:39.370
No.

40:39.436 --> 40:42.006
Moving into Ruskin Gardens.

40:42.072 --> 40:45.543
I don't think it was
a mistake, no.

40:46.744 --> 40:50.848
Seems like it's
a worthwhile thing to do.

40:50.915 --> 40:53.217
To try, at least.

40:55.052 --> 40:56.420
It's pretty complicated.

40:56.487 --> 40:59.757
As far as what you did
or didn't tell this detective?

40:59.824 --> 41:02.126
Yeah, for starters.

41:02.193 --> 41:05.262
I think you did
the right thing

41:05.329 --> 41:06.864
by not pointing him
in the direction

41:06.931 --> 41:08.065
of making Thora a suspect.

41:08.132 --> 41:10.701
I think if you had,
you'd regret it.

41:11.502 --> 41:13.571
You mean if she were to get
arrested and stand trial?

41:13.637 --> 41:16.273
Or if she were convicted
and sent to prison.

41:16.340 --> 41:19.810
Even though I may have
withheld evidence?

41:19.877 --> 41:21.712
(chuckles)

41:21.779 --> 41:24.548
Even though everything.

41:26.383 --> 41:28.485
You're so sure
of yourself.

41:28.552 --> 41:31.055
When there's something
to be sure about, yeah.
