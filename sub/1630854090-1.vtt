WEBVTT

00:43.000 --> 00:45.333
Can you believe it? I can't believe it.

01:02.041 --> 01:04.208
-What the hell was that?

01:07.666 --> 01:09.416
What if it's a Burned One?

01:13.875 --> 01:16.375
-You're a dick.
-Yeah, and you're a wuss.

01:16.458 --> 01:20.458
All I'm saying is if you two want to push
your tongues, or other things, together

01:20.541 --> 01:21.750
then do it out there.

01:28.458 --> 01:31.458
-Mm. Not bad for a Mind Fairy. Mm.
-Mm-hmm.

01:31.541 --> 01:34.500
-Keep going. It gets better.

01:34.583 --> 01:38.625
-Shit. Sorry, I was just being playful.

01:38.708 --> 01:40.000
I know. I'm into it.

01:40.083 --> 01:43.250
Are you sure? 'Cause I just got
a massive rush of disgust.

01:44.083 --> 01:45.083
That wasn't me.

01:56.041 --> 01:57.000
Hello?

01:59.875 --> 02:01.333
Hilarious, Nick.

02:01.416 --> 02:04.541
-But it's not gonna work a second time.
-I don't think that's Nick.

02:09.166 --> 02:10.166
Let's go.

02:15.166 --> 02:16.750
-Ivy.

02:16.833 --> 02:17.833
Come on.

02:19.166 --> 02:21.875
-I can't.
-What do you mean? Come on, let's go!

02:23.375 --> 02:24.625
I can't move.

02:28.666 --> 02:31.291
-Ivy!
-You have to get out of here, Devin.

02:34.958 --> 02:36.791
Run. Run!

02:57.750 --> 02:59.791
-Who's there?

02:59.875 --> 03:01.125
Nick?

03:11.291 --> 03:12.125
What?

03:50.125 --> 03:52.041
Your emotions are a tool.

03:53.125 --> 03:54.875
Nothing more, nothing less.

03:54.958 --> 03:58.666
They're a power source.
You've been told to control them.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.083
That isn't always the best option.

04:04.458 --> 04:07.041
In combat,
you'll need to rely on instinct.

04:15.916 --> 04:17.875
You'll need to let go.

04:35.416 --> 04:36.916
That's when you find true power.

04:50.708 --> 04:52.083
<i>Middle of the pack.</i>

04:52.166 --> 04:54.708
Been evaluating students
over the past month,

04:54.791 --> 04:56.166
and that's where you land.

04:57.750 --> 04:59.333
Better than the bottom.

05:00.750 --> 05:01.791
I try my best.

05:02.583 --> 05:05.500
Bullshit. You transformed last year.

05:05.583 --> 05:08.500
Turned the school upside down
looking for answers.

05:09.916 --> 05:10.958
You're powerful.

05:12.250 --> 05:13.458
This is a choice.

05:13.541 --> 05:16.291
When Dowling was headmistress,
I was doing really well.

05:18.958 --> 05:21.458
Loyalty is important. It should be valued.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.000
Yours is misplaced.

05:25.166 --> 05:26.625
Farah ran, Bloom.

05:28.125 --> 05:30.500
I don't know if she was scared
of the consequences

05:30.583 --> 05:32.083
of locking me under the school

05:32.166 --> 05:34.583
or if she just simply
saw the writing on the wall

05:34.666 --> 05:36.541
when Luna reinstated me, but she ran.

05:36.625 --> 05:37.958
Dowling wouldn't have run.

05:40.125 --> 05:43.416
-The Solarian Army is looking.
-They called off the search.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.458
It was an egregious waste of resources.

05:49.875 --> 05:52.208
-You don't care?
-I don't give one single fuck.

05:52.708 --> 05:54.875
She and Saul left me
a school of weak children,

05:54.958 --> 05:57.166
unprepared for the threats we face.

05:57.250 --> 05:58.250
What threats?

05:59.500 --> 06:01.416
No one's seen a Burned One
since I took them down.

06:01.500 --> 06:04.083
You think that's
the most dangerous thing out there?

06:05.000 --> 06:07.166
The Otherworld isn't like
where you grew up.

06:07.750 --> 06:11.333
You have no idea
of the kind of nightmares that exist here,

06:11.416 --> 06:12.416
but I do.

06:13.416 --> 06:16.416
And it's my job
to prepare you to fight them.

06:17.458 --> 06:20.500
A job Farah and Saul were unqualified for.

06:21.625 --> 06:23.291
The old regime is gone, Bloom.

06:25.791 --> 06:28.458
But… Silva is--

06:28.541 --> 06:33.625
Saul Silva is being brought to trial
at this very moment for his crimes.

06:34.125 --> 06:37.708
So, at the risk of repeating myself,
the old regime is gone.

06:38.250 --> 06:40.541
It's time to embrace the new one.

06:41.583 --> 06:43.125
<i>Rosalind'll get someone killed.</i>

06:44.041 --> 06:47.666
-Is it just me or has she gotten meaner?
-Might be the haircut.

06:47.750 --> 06:51.750
Channeling that much magic under stress
is dangerous. Most students aren't ready.

06:52.541 --> 06:54.833
If it hurts me, it's gonna hurt them more.

06:54.916 --> 06:57.875
Pretty sure Rosalind doesn't care
unless she gets results.

06:57.958 --> 07:01.583
-How long are you gonna hold back?
-Not gonna kill myself for her sake.

07:01.666 --> 07:04.666
As far I'm concerned,
she's not headmistress. Ms. Dowling is.

07:06.583 --> 07:09.541
I think we go on a road trip this weekend,
hit towns nearby.

07:09.625 --> 07:11.208
Just see if anyone's seen her.

07:11.291 --> 07:13.875
Bloom, I wanna find Dowling
just as badly as you do,

07:13.958 --> 07:17.291
but the entire Solarian Army
have been searching for months.

07:17.375 --> 07:19.791
And? What if
they just don't know where to look?

07:19.875 --> 07:21.541
What if she's still in hiding?

07:23.166 --> 07:27.291
All I'm saying is that this,
this is temporary. All of it.

07:29.291 --> 07:31.541
We're gonna get this school
back to the way it was.

07:35.166 --> 07:37.250
Don't look now, but you've got a lurker.

07:42.208 --> 07:44.625
Creepo. I'm gonna just get a better look.

07:49.958 --> 07:52.416
You know, I hate
99% of Rosalind's changes,

07:52.500 --> 07:54.291
but these uniforms are…

07:54.375 --> 07:57.041
If you play your cards right,
I might let you try it on.

08:00.041 --> 08:02.708
-Could've sworn I packed it.
-Check all the pockets?

08:02.791 --> 08:03.708
Yeah, I think.

08:03.791 --> 08:06.125
Honestly,
this has so many pockets.

08:06.208 --> 08:08.916
-It's kind of fab. I got it--
-Less talking. More searching.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.791
-Can we just stop for a second?
-No.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.958
It's an apron.
If it was in there, we'd see it.

08:14.041 --> 08:17.541
I left it in the room. Now I'll be late
for my shift at the greenhouse.

08:17.625 --> 08:19.041
Oh, do you think you could--

08:19.125 --> 08:22.083
And I'm talking to myself.
Great. Hello. Hi.

08:26.291 --> 08:29.583
It's not that I'm offended
you're embarrassed to be seen with us,

08:29.666 --> 08:31.875
but maybe you could give us
a warning before you…

08:32.375 --> 08:34.625
Why would I be embarrassed
to be seen with Musa?

08:34.708 --> 08:37.458
I'm just not dressed
for school-wide consumption.

08:38.541 --> 08:41.458
-I'm wearing off-brand crocs.
-What's wrong with Crocs?

08:41.541 --> 08:44.791
I thought when you ran away you weren't
meant to use invisibility magic?

08:44.875 --> 08:47.541
Yeah, I'm not,
but no-one's seen me do it.

08:47.625 --> 08:49.458
If they did, what are they gonna do?

08:49.541 --> 08:51.500
Tell my Mum?
I haven't spoken to her in weeks.

08:51.583 --> 08:53.166
Is that a positive or a negative?

08:53.250 --> 08:55.416
She is your mum,
but also kind of a monster.

08:55.500 --> 08:59.375
-Just trying to modulate my caretaking.
-Maybe just modulate it away from me.

08:59.458 --> 09:02.125
-Let's cut through the East Wing.
-That's new.

09:03.041 --> 09:05.041
Courtesy of Rosalind, no doubt.

09:06.750 --> 09:11.458
Look, I don't want to pull the
"do you know who I am" card, but… do you?

09:12.625 --> 09:15.750
Bet you wish you could walk through walls.
Warning, I'm quite gross.

09:15.833 --> 09:17.166
I'll be the judge of that.

09:17.750 --> 09:18.583
Oh.

09:19.083 --> 09:20.625
How was the, uh, greenhouse?

09:20.708 --> 09:23.708
At capacity. Six Specialists. Two fairies.

09:24.208 --> 09:27.166
Like Rosalind and Andreas
won't stop until we're all disfigured.

09:27.250 --> 09:28.916
Don't. Remember what Dad said.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.333
Oh, I know. Yeah, yeah.

09:30.416 --> 09:33.208
Quasi police state.
Gotta watch our tongue.

09:33.291 --> 09:35.083
Sam, it's not a joke.

09:35.166 --> 09:38.208
She expelled the Winoker twins
the first week she was here.

09:38.291 --> 09:40.791
-Right, the, uh, Shining twins.
-Lucky bastards.

09:40.875 --> 09:42.625
Except now they're missing.

09:42.708 --> 09:45.833
I just heard that two more students
didn't come home last week.

09:45.916 --> 09:47.708
A Specialist and Mind Fairy.

09:48.333 --> 09:52.000
It's probably a coincidence,
but, like, maybe let's not poke the bear?

09:52.666 --> 09:55.333
Going to the suite?
Could use a chill Musa playlist.

09:55.416 --> 09:56.583
No. No.

09:58.541 --> 10:00.666
It has nothing to do
with you two. It's just…

10:01.625 --> 10:05.500
it's actually a suite rule that Terra
came up with. That I agree with. Just…

10:06.000 --> 10:07.458
-See you later.
-See ya.

10:07.541 --> 10:11.458
You know, no boyfriends. Remember,
you two aren't the only couple now.

10:13.125 --> 10:15.625
I think your room
might be more quiet anyway.

10:43.041 --> 10:44.208
Congratulations.

10:44.791 --> 10:48.125
I've been out here three hours,
you're the first human I've seen.

10:48.208 --> 10:51.291
Yep. It's a quiet spot. Nice and private.

10:51.375 --> 10:55.458
It's a godsend. Specialist workouts
are crowded and tedious as hell.

10:56.500 --> 10:57.416
I'm Grey.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.166
And my eyes are up here.

11:01.833 --> 11:05.041
Aisha. And my bag is down there.
Where you're dripping.

11:05.583 --> 11:06.875
Oh! Less fun.

11:08.375 --> 11:10.500
So, are you gonna come out here a lot or…?

11:10.583 --> 11:13.375
Have you seen the hawk's nest at the bend?

11:13.458 --> 11:15.916
I was obsessed with them as a kid,
but I'd never seen--

11:16.000 --> 11:19.625
Yeah. I'd keep my distance.
She gets prickly if you get too close.

11:19.708 --> 11:21.583
Hm. So, are you two mates?

11:24.583 --> 11:27.250
Maybe we can work out
some sort of schedule for swims.

11:27.333 --> 11:29.541
No need to cross paths unnecessarily.

11:30.375 --> 11:32.750
She gets prickly if you get too close.

11:34.583 --> 11:36.125
Schedule away.

12:01.375 --> 12:04.750
The little prince
and the upstart. This should be good.

12:05.333 --> 12:06.291
First blood.

12:08.375 --> 12:10.541
Worried about staining your new outfit?

12:11.208 --> 12:13.583
Maybe home economics is more your speed?

12:14.375 --> 12:15.875
Is that what Saul taught?

12:17.416 --> 12:18.666
Did he wear an apron?

12:20.083 --> 12:22.833
Come on, let's just do it.
We're not gonna hurt each other.

12:31.333 --> 12:34.375
-Odds?
-First glance, it's Sky's to lose.

12:34.458 --> 12:35.958
Dane's got shit to prove.

12:37.125 --> 12:38.458
A lot of pressure.

12:42.708 --> 12:44.541
Yeah, Sky will, uh, give him space,

12:44.625 --> 12:47.375
let him think he's winning,
then find his opportunity.

12:52.041 --> 12:54.500
I give it three, two…

12:55.625 --> 12:58.375
Nah. Thing is,
this isn't a first glance fight.

12:58.458 --> 13:00.916
Sky won't draw blood.
Dane on the other hand…

13:10.958 --> 13:12.041
Nice.

13:16.250 --> 13:19.375
-He is such a prick.
-Yeah, and he's your dad.

13:19.458 --> 13:22.416
This mean you'll give me
a run for my money one day?

13:24.583 --> 13:28.750
Oi, Dane. Your little groupies
will send you dick pics later.

13:28.833 --> 13:31.833
Let's get him checked out.
You can explain this one.

13:33.250 --> 13:36.041
I like it in a cozy tea,
but if you want topical…

13:36.916 --> 13:40.208
-What's happened?
-Just a bit of sparring between friends.

13:40.708 --> 13:42.416
-What? You did this?
-Impressed?

13:45.541 --> 13:48.458
By the way,
Bea wants to hang tonight. You game?

13:49.083 --> 13:50.000
Always.

13:55.916 --> 13:56.791
What?

13:57.625 --> 13:59.000
Oh, come on.

14:00.916 --> 14:02.458
Use your words.

14:02.541 --> 14:06.125
-It's not just me. Everyone wants to know.
-Whatever do you mean, Terra?

14:06.208 --> 14:10.791
You know, you and Dane and Beatrix.
Like what--

14:10.875 --> 14:12.791
You wanna know whose mouth goes where?

14:12.875 --> 14:15.583
I can draw you a diagram.
You can keep it by your bed--

14:15.666 --> 14:16.750
No, that's not what…

14:16.833 --> 14:18.833
-Never mind.

14:19.333 --> 14:20.458
Ah.

14:24.583 --> 14:27.416
The more it bothers you,
the more he enjoys it.

14:31.583 --> 14:32.666
Am I good?

14:41.583 --> 14:42.958
Hey. Hold on.

14:45.333 --> 14:48.250
-I just… I just wanna…

14:51.250 --> 14:52.708
do that.

15:06.750 --> 15:07.958
Take off your shirt.

15:09.416 --> 15:10.958
-You first.

15:12.166 --> 15:13.541
-Sky.

15:13.625 --> 15:14.458
Sky.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.125
Okay. All right. Okay, okay.

15:21.250 --> 15:23.375
Oh. How bad is it?

15:24.041 --> 15:25.000
Annoyingly bad.

15:26.125 --> 15:28.333
Andreas is back
to this fight-to-first-blood kick.

15:28.416 --> 15:29.833
That's low.

15:31.041 --> 15:33.416
Mm. Even for him.

15:35.375 --> 15:36.416
It's fine.

15:38.375 --> 15:40.041
I'm fine.

15:52.958 --> 15:54.375
Have you heard anything?

15:55.083 --> 15:57.625
About Silva's trial in Solaria?

15:58.125 --> 16:00.625
I mean, there's supposed
to be news soon, right?

16:00.708 --> 16:02.708
I dunno. And I don't care.

16:10.250 --> 16:13.625
Messy hair, short breath, empty suite.

16:13.708 --> 16:16.708
Looks like clumsy vanilla sex
is on the menu this afternoon.

16:16.791 --> 16:19.250
Unless, snore,
you're waiting for marriage?

16:19.333 --> 16:20.666
What does Rosalind want?

16:22.000 --> 16:24.916
I assume she sent her little helper
'cause she wants something.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.958
I am not Rosalind's little helper.

16:28.291 --> 16:32.208
-So, she doesn't want to see me?
-She has a message about Silva.

16:32.291 --> 16:34.250
They're sending him to Polaris.

16:34.333 --> 16:36.000
Hm. So Beatrix wasn't lying.

16:36.083 --> 16:38.708
The Frozen North?
It's like a death sentence.

16:38.791 --> 16:40.500
First Dowling, now Silva.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.125
She could do it to my dad at any time.

16:43.208 --> 16:46.958
Sam says he's putting on a good face
for Rosalind. He's not happy about it--

16:47.041 --> 16:49.041
Isn't what he did self-defense?

16:49.125 --> 16:52.708
Andreas would've killed him
if he didn't fight back. Who's his lawyer?

16:52.791 --> 16:56.500
You think a courtroom drama played out?
Bloom, this isn't the First World.

16:56.583 --> 16:59.083
There was a tribunal,
then a decree from the Queen.

16:59.166 --> 17:02.166
But if your mum made the decree,
can she not unmake it?

17:02.250 --> 17:05.375
Even if we were speaking, she's not
in the habit of changing her mind.

17:05.458 --> 17:08.625
It's happening tomorrow.
Andreas is leading the transfer.

17:08.708 --> 17:10.083
We have to do something.

17:10.166 --> 17:13.875
Historically, letter-writing campaigns
have proved very effective.

17:14.666 --> 17:15.625
But they take time.

17:15.708 --> 17:19.958
I'm not so much thinking
in the letter-writing campaign realm. I'm…

17:21.125 --> 17:23.250
I'm thinking something active.

17:25.708 --> 17:28.583
Felony-wise, going against Solaria
is a pretty big step up

17:28.666 --> 17:30.500
from anything we got into last term.

17:30.583 --> 17:33.166
Going against Solaria
is not something you get into.

17:33.250 --> 17:36.333
Even if we thought we wanted to,
the Solarian Guard is brutal.

17:36.416 --> 17:38.750
-They're focused and they--
-And it's Silva.

17:43.208 --> 17:47.708
He is our only other link to Dowling.
To how things used to be.

17:47.791 --> 17:49.333
If we let them banish him,

17:49.416 --> 17:52.791
how long's it gonna be before they find
a reason to do the same with my dad?

17:53.791 --> 17:57.208
Just to be clear, we're talking,
like, full jailbreak, right?

17:57.958 --> 18:01.958
Obviously, we can't tell Aisha,
because she will try and stop us.

18:02.041 --> 18:03.958
Yeah. Bloom already told me.

18:04.041 --> 18:06.458
If there's one thing I learned last term,
it's listen to Aisha,

18:06.541 --> 18:08.708
'cause she's… she's usually right.

18:08.791 --> 18:09.791
For the record,

18:09.875 --> 18:12.916
I was against releasing Rosalind
because it was a dumb idea.

18:13.583 --> 18:17.541
This, well, it's still a dumb idea,
but at least if I plan it, it'll work.

18:18.291 --> 18:21.000
So, care to put your magic
where your mouth is?

18:22.000 --> 18:25.083
It's a simple escort mission.
Pick up the prisoner in Solaria,

18:25.166 --> 18:27.958
bring him to Long Shore,
where he'll board a ship for Polaris.

18:28.583 --> 18:31.250
The Solarian troops
will do the heavy lifting.

18:32.083 --> 18:33.250
We're just back-up.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.916
Will this be a problem for you?
Seeing the man who raised you in chains.

18:42.583 --> 18:44.833
Watching him get shipped off to exile?

18:47.125 --> 18:48.125
I'll manage.

18:51.208 --> 18:52.125
Unconvincing.

18:52.750 --> 18:53.708
Next time.

18:55.208 --> 18:56.041
What?

18:58.375 --> 18:59.375
Are you serious?

19:05.333 --> 19:06.791
Let's talk vulnerabilities.

19:07.291 --> 19:09.458
The most obvious one
is that I'm not coming.

19:10.541 --> 19:13.416
Dropping blondie makes sense,
but I'm actually useful.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.916
Rosalind wants you here.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
That's stupid.

19:17.916 --> 19:18.791
Dismissed.

19:24.333 --> 19:27.083
Never speak about Rosalind that way
in front of other people.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.125
-Whatever, I'm--
-Not whatever. Don't.

19:31.958 --> 19:35.791
Rosalind wants you here
because she knows how valuable you are.

19:35.875 --> 19:38.875
Does she? 'Cause I thought
once I helped her break out,

19:38.958 --> 19:41.166
she'd give me answers
about where I came from

19:41.250 --> 19:43.416
and maybe teach me some secret fairy shit.

19:43.500 --> 19:46.916
Instead, I follow her around
with a clipboard like a fucking secretary.

19:49.208 --> 19:51.333
I'm… I'm glad we're not in hiding anymore,

19:51.916 --> 19:54.458
but at least then,
I could do whatever I wanted.

19:57.291 --> 19:59.833
It was just us for 16 years, Little Storm.

20:01.875 --> 20:04.208
This was always going to be an adjustment.

20:05.958 --> 20:09.041
Trust me, in time, she'll reward you.

20:27.166 --> 20:28.500
What are you doing here?

20:35.416 --> 20:36.541
It's embarrassing.

20:38.208 --> 20:39.208
I'm listening.

20:40.708 --> 20:42.333
I was looking out for Sky.

20:43.083 --> 20:44.666
You mean you were stalking him?

20:45.750 --> 20:47.500
Yeah, I said it's embarrassing.

20:47.583 --> 20:50.500
Your shoes are embarrassing.
Stalking is pathetic.

20:52.750 --> 20:54.458
Look, you can't tell anyone, okay?

20:54.541 --> 20:56.708
Please, I'm not a snitch.

20:57.916 --> 21:00.375
But, like, go to therapy or something.

21:00.458 --> 21:01.625
It's been months.

21:02.333 --> 21:03.500
Jesus.

21:08.125 --> 21:10.333
-Yeah, I know. Exactly.
-Aisha.

21:12.291 --> 21:13.250
Hawk Girl.

21:13.333 --> 21:14.166
Mm.

21:14.250 --> 21:17.666
That reminds me, are you heading
to the river tonight? Or is it free?

21:18.833 --> 21:19.833
Go for it.

21:20.541 --> 21:23.625
You're always welcome to join me
if you want another show.

21:23.708 --> 21:25.833
I'm gonna audition new Speedos tonight.

21:25.916 --> 21:27.000
Makes my eyes pop.

21:31.875 --> 21:36.291
-Um, how do you know him?
-He's Sam's roommate. How do <i>you</i> know him?

21:36.375 --> 21:38.416
I don't. He's just annoying.

21:38.500 --> 21:40.458
-Mm. I do feel annoyance.

21:40.541 --> 21:44.458
-I also feel something like a tingle.
-Stella just sent pictures of the route.

21:44.541 --> 21:47.291
-Maybe tingle's not the right word.
-We should figure out a plan.

21:47.375 --> 21:50.166
-Like a warm, fuzzy--
-I'll drown you.

21:53.666 --> 21:56.708
The closest the caravan
will get to the school is 10 km or so.

21:56.791 --> 21:59.666
Andreas's route
has him crossing the river here,

21:59.750 --> 22:02.750
but according to Terra, that bridge
got burned out weeks ago.

22:02.833 --> 22:05.083
The third years had a party,
drunk Fire Fairy.

22:05.166 --> 22:07.041
Nobody wants to tell the grown-ups.

22:07.125 --> 22:11.458
We'll have to divert to this side road,
which has more cover anyway.

22:11.541 --> 22:14.708
-That's where we need to stop the caravan.
-I can explode it.

22:15.416 --> 22:17.708
Yes, or I could flood the engine.

22:19.333 --> 22:21.625
Yeah, smarter. And quieter.

22:21.708 --> 22:23.833
Musa'll let us know
if anybody's suspicious.

22:23.916 --> 22:27.375
-Human mood ring reporting for duty.
-Then it's the Stella show.

22:27.458 --> 22:30.583
She goes invisible, grabs the key
and breaks him out. Can you manage?

22:30.666 --> 22:31.958
Of course.

22:32.458 --> 22:36.375
I just hope I don't hurt my back
from carrying basically the entire plan.

22:40.416 --> 22:41.583
Yes, Terra?

22:41.666 --> 22:44.791
I just think we should take a moment
to appreciate this.

22:44.875 --> 22:47.916
All of us working together,
despite what Rosalind's up to.

22:48.416 --> 22:49.666
The Winx suite, a team.

22:49.750 --> 22:52.750
Even Stella, who'll deny
she's enjoying being part of the group,

22:52.833 --> 22:54.625
enjoying being part of the group.

22:55.750 --> 23:00.458
I just want us all to remember that,
no matter how bad things get out there,

23:01.250 --> 23:02.625
in here, things are good.

23:39.416 --> 23:42.041
I spoke with
the Specialist and fairy prefects.

23:42.125 --> 23:44.333
Everyone was checked
into their rooms last night.

23:44.416 --> 23:46.791
Not that they'd squeal
about a little graffiti.

23:46.875 --> 23:49.875
The only ones unaccounted for
are that couple, Ivy and Devin.

23:50.375 --> 23:52.125
But they haven't been seen in days.

23:52.625 --> 23:54.625
Do you know anything about that?

23:55.416 --> 23:58.791
Only that neither
were particularly promising students.

23:59.583 --> 24:01.333
What are people saying about them?

24:01.416 --> 24:02.833
The gossip has intensified.

24:02.916 --> 24:05.833
The most ridiculous is you caught them
outside school past curfew

24:05.916 --> 24:07.291
and they're being punished.

24:08.625 --> 24:10.250
Absurd. Obviously.

24:11.916 --> 24:15.958
However, the fact that nobody has heard
from them is moderately unsettling.

24:16.041 --> 24:18.750
Especially when you consider
the other missing fairies.

24:18.833 --> 24:20.250
The twins you expelled.

24:21.333 --> 24:24.250
You're following their case.
If there's something to be worried--

24:24.333 --> 24:27.666
Then I will let you know.
With the rest of the students.

24:27.750 --> 24:29.625
I can be more useful
if I know what's going on.

24:29.708 --> 24:31.375
You are exactly useful enough.

24:31.875 --> 24:34.791
You're in the East Wing
every night for hours on end.

24:34.875 --> 24:37.416
There's a book in your office
in a language I've never seen.

24:37.500 --> 24:40.416
Gossip aside, it's peculiar
that ever since you came here,

24:40.500 --> 24:43.333
fairies from this school
have started to go missing.

24:43.416 --> 24:45.833
Incompetent fairies, sure, but even so.

24:46.708 --> 24:47.916
Keeping secrets from me

24:48.000 --> 24:50.416
is objectively stupid
and a waste of my talent.

24:53.500 --> 24:56.291
James,
would you like to take a break?

24:56.875 --> 24:58.375
Beatrix can clean the rest.

25:22.041 --> 25:23.541
<i>I know you've been busy.</i>

25:24.375 --> 25:26.291
But I wanted to know if we could talk.

25:26.791 --> 25:28.416
Okay. All right.

25:29.208 --> 25:30.583
Let's deal with this now.

25:30.666 --> 25:33.500
Sixteen years ago,
Rosalind ordered me into hiding.

25:34.291 --> 25:37.333
Everyone thought I was dead.
That was useful to her.

25:38.541 --> 25:41.125
I couldn't reach out
to anyone in my old life.

25:41.208 --> 25:42.833
<i>Including my son.</i>

25:43.333 --> 25:44.541
<i>It wasn't personal, Sky.</i>

25:45.666 --> 25:46.958
It was an order.

25:50.208 --> 25:52.666
Saul gave me this when I was little.

25:53.291 --> 25:56.000
<i>He said it was yours.</i>
<i>Thought you might want it back.</i>

26:03.250 --> 26:06.041
Well, I don't know
whose unbalanced piece of shit this is…

26:08.791 --> 26:09.958
but it's not mine.

26:28.166 --> 26:29.666
Day drinking, huh?

26:31.708 --> 26:35.208
Wanna join? Riven's out for the day,
so the place is all ours.

26:37.500 --> 26:38.500
I can't.

26:39.416 --> 26:43.125
I have to have a clear head.
I have a… big afternoon.

26:43.208 --> 26:44.208
Big afternoon?

26:47.416 --> 26:48.375
-Silva…

26:52.541 --> 26:54.208
-Actually, don't tell me.
-Sky--

26:54.291 --> 26:56.708
I… I know you well enough now

26:57.416 --> 27:00.208
to know that I can't stop you
doing what you wanna do.

27:03.208 --> 27:05.708
If Silva gets sent to exile,
he's not coming back.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.291
Ever.

27:08.875 --> 27:10.958
He's a part of this school. We need him.

27:11.916 --> 27:13.916
Is that really why you're doing this?

27:19.375 --> 27:21.291
You need him, Sky.

27:24.333 --> 27:26.291
It's an avalanche of shit, Bloom.

27:26.375 --> 27:28.750
If you succeed or fail, an avalanche.

27:29.541 --> 27:30.875
And he's not worth it.

28:00.291 --> 28:02.291
You look like actual dog shit, Saul.

28:03.125 --> 28:04.208
And you smell worse.

28:04.291 --> 28:07.333
I've been in jail for months.
What's your excuse?

28:10.958 --> 28:15.041
Even after everything,
you're still just Rosalind's errand boy.

28:18.583 --> 28:20.125
We both chose our leader.

28:21.375 --> 28:23.291
But only one of us is in chains.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.708
-Let's move out.

28:34.791 --> 28:37.958
-Can you move your seat forward?
-Your legs aren't that long.

28:38.041 --> 28:41.291
-Can you not eat? Dad's funny about it.
-I'll be careful, promise.

28:41.375 --> 28:43.875
-Music. We need music.
-No. We need Stella.

28:43.958 --> 28:45.833
-That's probably her.

28:48.291 --> 28:49.375
Grey?

28:49.458 --> 28:50.500
How did he…

28:51.708 --> 28:54.208
-Did you give Grey my number?
-Okay. Don't be mad.

28:54.291 --> 28:55.458
-Grey who?
-Who's Grey?

28:55.541 --> 28:58.041
You introduced me to Sam.
I'm returning the favor.

28:58.125 --> 29:01.000
-This is so different.
-Distinctions and similarities.

29:01.083 --> 29:02.958
Front of the car would like to weigh in.

29:03.041 --> 29:06.625
-We have enough going on. Now this?
-A guy you like texting?

29:06.708 --> 29:08.125
-You like him?
-No!

29:08.208 --> 29:09.625
Never bet against a Mind Fairy.

29:09.708 --> 29:12.000
He asked Sam for your number.
Sam asked me.

29:12.083 --> 29:13.541
Wait. This is Sam's roommate?

29:13.625 --> 29:16.541
-Grey the Specialist? With the abs?
-Abs?

29:21.458 --> 29:23.166
My office. Now.

29:29.458 --> 29:31.041
It's just so fucked.

29:31.541 --> 29:34.416
This isn't some criminal
we're talking about. It's Silva.

29:34.500 --> 29:37.458
Once he's transferred,
we won't have to think about it. Relax.

29:37.541 --> 29:39.583
Do you really have no doubts?

29:41.250 --> 29:43.000
How the hell do you have no doubts?

29:43.083 --> 29:45.083
'Cause doubts used to be all that I had.

29:45.166 --> 29:48.208
Do you remember
how pathetic I was last year? How weak?

29:48.708 --> 29:51.583
But then I met Beatrix,
and then I met you.

29:51.666 --> 29:53.958
-And now I know who I am.
-Dane--

29:54.041 --> 29:57.375
You're never gonna catch
those kind of feelings for me, I know.

29:58.125 --> 30:00.208
I'm still getting what I want out of this.

30:00.291 --> 30:03.541
I know you are, too,
so sit back and don't think too much.

30:06.125 --> 30:08.125
Thursday the 2nd, 10 a.m.

30:08.208 --> 30:11.291
Monday the 6th,37 p.m.

30:11.375 --> 30:12.500
Courtyard.

30:13.041 --> 30:16.541
-Wednesday the 8th, 7a.m. Canteen.

30:17.625 --> 30:19.375
Motor court on the 10th.

30:20.041 --> 30:21.750
The East Wing yesterday.

30:22.333 --> 30:23.375
The list goes on.

30:23.458 --> 30:27.875
I was wondering what part
of "invisibility magic is off-limits"

30:27.958 --> 30:29.833
was confusing to you?

30:29.916 --> 30:33.458
Can we just say you've called my mum
and she's on her way to punish me?

30:34.833 --> 30:36.333
-She's not.

30:36.416 --> 30:39.333
She's tired
of rewarding bad behavior with attention.

30:39.416 --> 30:42.416
You used invisibility magic
to run away last year,

30:42.500 --> 30:43.916
which is why she forbid it.

30:45.083 --> 30:49.041
-She told me if you didn't listen--

30:52.416 --> 30:54.625
What's that?

30:58.208 --> 30:59.291
Take your jacket off.

31:01.583 --> 31:03.666
I'd rather not do it for you.

31:11.250 --> 31:14.083
This will prevent you
from using that particular power.

31:14.166 --> 31:16.166
It will also keep you on school grounds.

31:23.916 --> 31:26.750
-We have to go.
-We can't without Stella. She is the plan.

31:26.833 --> 31:29.666
-We'll figure something out on the way.

31:45.083 --> 31:50.375
What if I bloom a bunch of pollen
and give all the guards allergy attacks?

31:50.458 --> 31:52.583
Okay, no, ignore that. That wouldn't work.

31:53.375 --> 31:57.291
Okay, no, wait, I've got another.
No, wait. This is good, okay. Or, um…

31:57.375 --> 32:02.000
No, this is good. What if Aisha makes them
all need to pee at the same time? Brill!

32:02.083 --> 32:05.041
No bad ideas in brainstorming,
but maybe a breath.

32:05.625 --> 32:08.333
I'll make sure there's not another way
to cross the river.

32:10.708 --> 32:15.416
Holograms. What if we use holograms?
You and Bloom could create a mirage and--

32:15.500 --> 32:17.958
Can you just stop? Please.
My first plan was good.

32:18.041 --> 32:20.166
We don't have time
to come up with another.

32:22.250 --> 32:23.666
It's okay. You got this.

32:24.333 --> 32:26.083
I'm gonna take a look at the maps.

32:30.875 --> 32:31.916
What did you just do?

32:32.000 --> 32:34.333
I've gotten better
at taking in people's emotions.

32:34.416 --> 32:37.208
-I took the edge off her anxiety.
-Without telling her?

32:37.291 --> 32:40.375
If she knows I did it, it'll come back.
It's okay. Promise.

32:40.458 --> 32:42.125
It feels like a really bad idea.

32:42.208 --> 32:43.916
Come on. We should help her out.

33:18.916 --> 33:21.541
-Shit!

33:31.375 --> 33:34.625
I think something got attacked.
There was blood with purple in it.

33:34.708 --> 33:36.791
Is that a thing here? Purple blood?

33:36.875 --> 33:39.833
Everything's a thing here.
I'll look it up when we get back.

33:39.916 --> 33:42.000
Got it. Minor modifications,

33:42.083 --> 33:44.750
but the first half
of the plan is the same. Let's go.

33:56.541 --> 33:59.625
<i>With the bridge out,</i>
<i>the caravan'll have to go north.</i>

34:02.125 --> 34:04.000
<i>I'll flood the transport's engine.</i>

34:06.458 --> 34:07.750
<i>Here's where it's tricky.</i>

34:09.166 --> 34:13.500
<i>Without Stella's invisibility magic,</i>
<i>we have to help Silva break himself out.</i>

34:14.958 --> 34:16.916
<i>-Terra will get us the key.</i>
-Wait.

34:22.916 --> 34:24.000
<i>To keep moving,</i>

34:24.083 --> 34:26.208
<i>they'll switch Silva</i>
<i>to a less secure spot.</i>

34:27.458 --> 34:29.625
<i>Terra's vines have limited range.</i>

34:30.875 --> 34:31.875
<i>My water doesn't.</i>

34:32.625 --> 34:34.750
<i>Timing is everything.</i>

34:43.625 --> 34:45.125
<i>Then it's up to Silva.</i>

34:48.000 --> 34:50.833
-Nothing's happening.
-He needs a distraction.

34:52.625 --> 34:54.250
Can you pull gas from that tank?

35:04.750 --> 35:05.791
What the fuck?

35:12.416 --> 35:13.541
Stop!

35:27.583 --> 35:30.250
Argh! Ah! Ah!

35:32.125 --> 35:33.166
Saul!

35:40.208 --> 35:41.458
Where is he?

35:54.791 --> 35:57.250
He can't
hold his breath forever.

36:19.625 --> 36:21.166
He's calming down. We're good.

36:21.250 --> 36:24.208
-How long can you hold him under?
-Long enough for them to leave.

36:24.916 --> 36:28.625
Let's move downstream.
Either he'll surface or his body will.

36:39.250 --> 36:41.208
The skullcaps are the last of them.

36:42.000 --> 36:45.458
-What does Rosalind want these for?
-Not our concern.

36:45.541 --> 36:49.125
I'm sorry, but we are drowning here,
dealing with hurt students all day.

36:49.208 --> 36:52.666
She can tell us why we're spending
our off-hours pulling random herbs.

36:52.750 --> 36:54.833
I know, I know, I know. You're tired.

36:55.416 --> 36:58.916
-I am, too, but best to put on a smile.
-I'm not gonna do that, Dad.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.375
Sorry, I'm not you.

37:00.458 --> 37:04.125
And to be honest,
watching you pretend, you look pathetic.

37:04.208 --> 37:05.083
Sam!

37:06.166 --> 37:07.708
I will not be spoken to like that.

37:07.791 --> 37:10.500
Except by Rosalind?
She can speak to you how she wants.

37:12.125 --> 37:13.083
We need the room.

37:13.166 --> 37:14.166
Course you do.

37:15.083 --> 37:16.416
I'd watch my tongue.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.583
Unless you'd like me to look a bit closer

37:19.666 --> 37:22.125
into which students
could possibly be responsible

37:22.208 --> 37:25.458
for evading the guards long enough
to graffiti the school?

37:28.250 --> 37:30.583
I haven't expelled anyone in a few weeks.

37:31.333 --> 37:32.333
I'm due.

37:37.916 --> 37:40.875
But first, we need to discuss
what happened today.

37:42.250 --> 37:44.291
We need to talk about Saul Silva.

37:46.750 --> 37:50.375
That has to be the most reckless thing
you have ever done.

37:50.458 --> 37:53.666
-I don't think that's very true.
-Weren't you here last year?

37:53.750 --> 37:57.125
Yeah. When Bloom went crazy
and let loose Evil Headmistress.

37:59.541 --> 38:00.458
What do we do now?

38:02.041 --> 38:03.541
Take me to Blackbridge.

38:05.833 --> 38:09.041
<i>Right off the town square,</i>
<i>my friend Sebastian owns a store.</i>

38:09.666 --> 38:11.583
<i>He helped us take down Rosalind.</i>

38:12.375 --> 38:13.375
<i>He'll hide me.</i>

38:19.666 --> 38:22.708
I, uh… I was getting a killer Airbnb rate
on this place.

38:22.791 --> 38:25.750
So I'll expect some form
of compensation. All right?

38:26.750 --> 38:30.541
Wine's good. Whiskey's better.
Don't cheap out.

38:30.625 --> 38:34.666
And, uh, as for
this whole hobo situation, right,

38:36.333 --> 38:39.333
it's from the '90s,
but the blades are still good, so…

38:39.916 --> 38:42.208
Just let me know
how many bandages you need.

38:42.708 --> 38:44.750
-Thank you very much.
-Any time.

38:44.833 --> 38:46.958
<i> I'm with Silva</i>
<i>in Sebastian's shop,</i>

38:47.041 --> 38:49.458
but I think it's best
if you wait until tomorrow.

38:49.541 --> 38:53.833
-But if you come down after training--
-I'm not going down there, Bloom.

38:54.333 --> 38:55.166
<i>Sky.</i>

38:55.708 --> 38:57.666
Please just talk to him on the phone.

38:58.291 --> 39:00.041
<i>Look, I'm happy you're okay.</i>

39:00.125 --> 39:01.416
<i>I'm happy it worked out</i>

39:01.500 --> 39:03.458
and you got what you wanted, but I'm…

39:05.625 --> 39:07.166
I don't wanna talk to him.

39:17.875 --> 39:18.958
Give me good news.

39:19.833 --> 39:24.291
We didn't find a body,
so not the worst-case scenario.

39:24.375 --> 39:26.500
Arrows right in the back.
Fucking savage.

39:26.583 --> 39:28.875
Then he did this sad-ass flop
into the river.

39:28.958 --> 39:31.375
-It was game over!
-You think this is funny?

39:32.625 --> 39:35.708
Sky! No, we were, um, just chatting.

39:36.458 --> 39:38.708
Chatting? About a guy
getting shot in the back?

39:39.708 --> 39:42.208
Just messing around. Relax, mate.

39:42.291 --> 39:44.708
-I'm not gonna relax.
-Okay then, don't relax.

39:44.791 --> 39:47.583
But I think we both remember
what happened last time.

39:55.250 --> 39:57.208
Sky! Get the fuck off him!

39:58.166 --> 39:59.625
-Man…

39:59.708 --> 40:01.916
Let me know
when you wanna keep chatting, mate.

40:08.833 --> 40:09.791
Hmph.

40:18.250 --> 40:20.583
Sorry, Saul. Um…

40:21.291 --> 40:22.541
Sky will come round.

40:26.666 --> 40:30.708
When you were at the Capitol,
did you hear anything about Dowling?

40:31.375 --> 40:34.708
I've been trying my best,
but the Solarian Army, they're giving up.

40:34.791 --> 40:36.791
I wish I knew where she went, Bloom.

40:39.041 --> 40:43.416
But we're not gonna give up hope just yet.
Sebastian has a knack of finding things.

40:43.500 --> 40:46.250
Mm-hmm. I'm, uh, I'm like a terrier.

40:47.375 --> 40:49.666
But, like, you know, cooler.

40:49.750 --> 40:52.291
Actually maybe a different dog.
What dogs are cool?

40:55.250 --> 40:59.458
So am I supposed to let it go? Go back
to school and act like things are normal?

40:59.541 --> 41:00.375
No.

41:02.250 --> 41:04.708
No, because everything's… it's not normal.

41:05.208 --> 41:08.625
You need to remember that,
'cause Rosalind will try to wear you down,

41:08.708 --> 41:11.250
and you will forget
what normal used to be like.

41:12.083 --> 41:14.208
Meanwhile, it would appear that Luna

41:15.291 --> 41:18.666
allowed Rosalind access
to the Royal Archives.

41:18.750 --> 41:21.416
-Shit.
-What is it? What's in the Royal Archives?

41:21.500 --> 41:24.583
-Ancient texts. Powerful relics.
-The good stuff.

41:24.666 --> 41:25.583
Mm-hmm.

41:26.541 --> 41:29.541
Yeah, she's planning something.
Something big.

41:31.875 --> 41:33.166
This is all my fault.

41:34.916 --> 41:35.833
All of it.

41:38.083 --> 41:41.958
Dowling. You.
Everything that's happening at Alfea…

41:42.041 --> 41:44.750
…it's all…
because I was selfish

41:44.833 --> 41:46.000
and I wanted answers.

41:49.333 --> 41:50.916
If I didn't let Rosalind out--

41:51.000 --> 41:54.041
Somebody else would've.
She couldn't stay down there forever.

41:54.833 --> 41:56.791
But you're right about one thing.

41:58.916 --> 42:00.250
<i>Whatever she's up to,</i>

42:01.416 --> 42:03.208
<i>it started 17 years ago.</i>

42:04.583 --> 42:06.041
<i>And it started with you.</i>

42:13.583 --> 42:15.875
I didn't know
your powers had that range.

42:15.958 --> 42:18.250
-Neither did I.
-It was amazing.

42:18.791 --> 42:21.833
What the hell, Stella?
You blanked us all day. We needed you.

42:21.916 --> 42:24.291
I thought we were in this together.
I did the speech.

42:25.875 --> 42:28.291
Maybe let's not gang up
before we know the full story.

42:29.041 --> 42:31.875
I was on my way,
but Rosalind called me into her office.

42:31.958 --> 42:35.250
Apparently, I haven't been
as discreet as I thought with my magic.

42:35.333 --> 42:37.291
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

42:37.375 --> 42:38.708
It's fine. She just

42:39.875 --> 42:41.041
gave me a warning.

42:42.875 --> 42:43.833
You have a visitor.

42:45.708 --> 42:48.125
-Where have you been?
-Whoa there, killer.

42:51.750 --> 42:53.291
Sorry, I'm just…

42:54.333 --> 42:56.708
It's my dad and Rosalind and…

42:59.166 --> 43:01.833
Sometimes, you're the only person
who can make me feel better.

43:03.333 --> 43:04.166
Come here.

43:26.875 --> 43:29.083
-He's fine.
-Didn't seem fine.

43:29.166 --> 43:32.375
Give him some time
to cool off, okay?

43:32.458 --> 43:34.291
Yeah, okay.

43:35.250 --> 43:38.041
Are we done with the emotional portion
of this evening?

43:38.125 --> 43:41.875
I've had a shitty day and I'd like it
if you two'd help me forget about it.

44:25.666 --> 44:27.041
It wasn't personal, Sky.

44:27.708 --> 44:31.208
Andreas was flawed. We all are.

44:46.916 --> 44:48.416
Sky isn't in there.

44:52.166 --> 44:55.333
I'm sure
that this looks extra pathetic.

45:00.375 --> 45:01.708
I need a drink.

45:18.333 --> 45:19.375
I've been scared.

45:21.625 --> 45:23.333
That's why I've been holding back.

45:24.500 --> 45:27.375
Last term I put my magic
and my life over everything else,

45:27.458 --> 45:29.458
and it didn't work out so great.

45:30.458 --> 45:32.708
I may have a different opinion about that.

45:33.958 --> 45:35.583
You're the reason I'm standing here.

45:36.166 --> 45:37.041
Exactly.

45:38.250 --> 45:41.750
No offense, but everyone in the school
hates you and what you've done.

45:41.833 --> 45:43.250
Ah.

45:43.333 --> 45:45.166
The displeasure of the masses.

45:46.291 --> 45:49.666
Do you know what happens
if you listen to them? The mob?

45:51.416 --> 45:52.250
Nothing.

45:53.458 --> 45:54.458
Nothing happens.

45:55.875 --> 45:59.750
Nothing of any significance anyway.
Everyone gets fat and happy.

45:59.833 --> 46:01.541
The world grinds to a halt.

46:03.708 --> 46:04.833
Or they get slaughtered.

46:06.500 --> 46:08.458
-That's bleak.
-That's life.

46:09.916 --> 46:11.083
The reality is,

46:11.666 --> 46:13.458
I don't care that people hate me.

46:14.083 --> 46:17.875
I don't care what they think.
That's how I get shit done.

46:19.375 --> 46:20.875
You care about something.

46:22.041 --> 46:23.208
You care about me.

46:33.708 --> 46:35.416
I don't wanna hold back anymore.

46:38.791 --> 46:40.833
<i>I told her I wanted</i>
<i>one-on-one lessons every day.</i>

46:40.916 --> 46:42.750
That is a lot of Rosalind.

46:43.458 --> 46:46.958
I'm gonna find out what she's up to.
We're gonna use that to take her down.

46:50.500 --> 46:51.458
Do you--

46:52.791 --> 46:55.083
Do you, like, think I'm going too far?

46:58.416 --> 47:00.458
Okay, so love you.

47:00.958 --> 47:02.416
Genuinely. BFF.

47:02.500 --> 47:05.208
But I can't be your moral compass, Bloom.

47:06.416 --> 47:10.375
It's fun to say Aisha's always right,
but that's a lot of pressure to put on me.

47:11.500 --> 47:14.125
Don't worry. I'm not gonna stop
telling you how I feel.

47:17.416 --> 47:18.875
Can I ask about Grey now?

47:20.083 --> 47:21.833
They are so hideous.

47:22.416 --> 47:23.250
But?

47:24.208 --> 47:27.041
-They're not uncomfortable.

47:27.791 --> 47:31.666
Thing is, now that you have
that gem, you can't just disappear.

47:33.166 --> 47:34.000
So?

47:34.083 --> 47:36.958
So you have to give a fuck
about what you look like again.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.666
Told your roommates
about your shiny new accessory?

47:44.750 --> 47:46.875
It's embarrassing enough that you know.

47:46.958 --> 47:51.166
And a suite full of sympathy and pity
makes my skin crawl.

47:51.250 --> 47:55.958
No sympathy here. My situation
is equally, if not more fucked up.

47:56.041 --> 47:58.958
Oh, sorry. Are we having
some sort of, uh, trauma-off here?

47:59.541 --> 48:01.750
Because you really
don't know the half of it.

48:02.333 --> 48:03.833
-Think I'd win.
-Help!

48:15.708 --> 48:18.458
-Oh my God. What happened?

48:26.833 --> 48:27.958
Rosalind.

48:37.208 --> 48:38.250
Shit.
