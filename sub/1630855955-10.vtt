WEBVTT

00:03.086 --> 00:03.837
Previously on Below Deck Med...

00:06.840 --> 00:08.133
What’s S?

00:10.468 --> 00:12.387
Kyle, a part of a community is
just supposed to be accepting.

00:12.429 --> 00:13.763
Do you want me to take
a back seat?

00:13.805 --> 00:14.931
Don’t tell me to
take a back seat.

00:14.973 --> 00:16.099
I’m one of your friends.

00:16.141 --> 00:17.183
Our friendship has
never been real.

00:17.225 --> 00:18.435
You’ve been a fake ass bitch.

00:18.476 --> 00:19.936
talking sh-- behind my back
since day one.

00:19.978 --> 00:21.521
She will throw you
under the ----ing bus.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.231
Kyle, I’ve never been
spoken like that in my life.

00:23.273 --> 00:24.858
I can’t believe that
actually you’re saying this.

00:24.899 --> 00:26.067
It’s awful.

00:34.909 --> 00:35.994
-Qua?
-Yeah.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.704
There’s a bad vibe now.
You can feel it.

00:37.746 --> 00:40.206
I feel like no one really cares
about what’s happened to Natalya

00:40.248 --> 00:41.750
the way she’s getting treated.

00:44.419 --> 00:45.795
Oh, no.

00:45.837 --> 00:48.715
My issue is, besides the
personal stuff going on at home,

00:48.757 --> 00:52.093
there’s also been stuff going
on within the interior.

00:53.219 --> 00:54.763
I’m done with Kyle.
100%.

00:54.804 --> 00:57.307
He’ll definitely be getting
blocked on the old Instagram,

00:57.349 --> 01:00.935
and that makes it official.

01:00.977 --> 01:02.395
Losing Natalya,

01:02.437 --> 01:04.356
I need a stew ASAP,
and I can’t be that picky.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.150
Yeah.

01:08.318 --> 01:09.736
You can’t leave us, mate.

01:09.778 --> 01:11.404
Natalya’s the best
stewardess on this boat.

01:11.446 --> 01:13.198
The others, they’ve got what
they want, now.

01:13.239 --> 01:14.783
I’m really ----ing pissed off.

01:17.118 --> 01:19.120
Kyle, your screaming
match with Max,

01:19.162 --> 01:21.247
and your screaming match
with Natalya.

01:21.289 --> 01:23.208
I don’t want a person
like you on board.

01:23.249 --> 01:25.877
-You understand?
-Yes, Captain.

01:29.673 --> 01:32.258
Every situation that’s
happened on this boat,

01:32.300 --> 01:35.929
guess who’s the common
denominator?

01:35.970 --> 01:37.931
This is a professional setting.

01:37.972 --> 01:39.432
You want to be Chief Stew.

01:39.474 --> 01:41.810
You can’t even
control your emotions.

01:41.851 --> 01:45.980
I promise you, I will put
you on the dock so fast

01:46.022 --> 01:47.273
if you don’t change.

01:47.315 --> 01:48.858
You’re bullying.
You’re screaming.

01:48.900 --> 01:52.696
You lack of respect in
the workplace for people.

01:52.737 --> 01:54.489
I won’t tolerate it, Kyle.

01:54.531 --> 01:57.242
If I have one crew member
come to me about you,

01:57.283 --> 01:59.119
you’re off.
You understand?

01:59.160 --> 02:00.620
-Understood..
-Okay, thank you.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.372
I’m finished.

02:02.414 --> 02:04.207
You get the jacuzzi?

02:04.249 --> 02:05.500
Just here for the moment.

02:05.542 --> 02:08.837
-I’m over this sh--, bro.
-I hear ya.

02:16.428 --> 02:18.680
Says he needs
to follow his heart.

02:21.182 --> 02:23.351
It’s crazy how much can
change in a day.

02:23.393 --> 02:26.354
[bleep]

02:26.396 --> 02:27.814
-Yeah.
-What’s happening?

02:28.857 --> 02:30.608
Kyle?

02:30.650 --> 02:32.944
No, don’t do that.

02:32.986 --> 02:37.657
Captain, I’ve never seen her so
angry for Natalya’s departure

02:37.699 --> 02:41.327
and she asks me who’s
the common denominator.

02:41.369 --> 02:43.163
I will take that.
I had my arguments.

02:43.204 --> 02:45.498
But being called
common denominator,

02:45.540 --> 02:47.542
you can understand that
would upset you, too.

02:47.584 --> 02:52.339
Look, people were angry and
I agree that you need to speak

02:52.380 --> 02:55.425
a certain way to people,
but it was resolved.

02:55.467 --> 02:56.843
We’re here to make money.

02:56.885 --> 02:59.429
Don’t let this affect your
whole charter season.

03:06.811 --> 03:07.812
[belches]

03:07.854 --> 03:10.648
Pardon, that
was really a mistake.

03:10.690 --> 03:14.402
I am starting to see that
he is the common denominator.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.237
Kyle definitely has
to take accountability.

03:16.279 --> 03:18.281
You can’t always be the victim.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.283
The only thing that
I can do is support him

03:20.325 --> 03:21.743
to, like, just focus
on his work

03:21.785 --> 03:24.579
because without him
and his skillsets,

03:24.621 --> 03:26.748
we’re pretty much screwed.

03:28.500 --> 03:31.044
Tumi, climbing to cabins now.

03:31.086 --> 03:32.629
Okay.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.173
Please don’t leave me.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.466
Yeah, but bro, you know...

03:36.508 --> 03:38.134
Is it what happened
the other night?

03:38.176 --> 03:39.719
No, no, it’s just like...

03:39.761 --> 03:41.304
You’re going to do
this charter with us?

03:41.346 --> 03:42.597
Yeah, yeah, I’m going to
do the charter

03:42.639 --> 03:44.808
because I promise and
I will not let you down.

03:44.849 --> 03:47.602
I can have my French touch
for the last time, you know.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.145
Are you going to
speak with Sandy?

03:49.187 --> 03:50.355
I’m scared, huh?

03:50.397 --> 03:52.107
Yeah, but I think
you should speak to her

03:52.148 --> 03:53.233
that she can get someone new in.

03:53.274 --> 03:54.567
Yeah, for sure.

03:54.609 --> 03:57.237
Me and Max got off to
a very rocky start.

03:57.278 --> 03:58.655
My friend, it’s so heavy.

03:58.697 --> 04:00.699
We don’t have time to ----ing
sit around and wank.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.535
But he’s slowly but
surely growing on me.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.745
Like, I’m starting to
really like this guy.

04:05.787 --> 04:08.581
When he does give 100%,
he’s really good at it.

04:08.623 --> 04:11.459
Do I need to take you
in like a little dog?

04:11.501 --> 04:13.211
Do you want to sleep
in my bed with me?

04:13.253 --> 04:14.504
Should I nurture you?

04:14.546 --> 04:15.922
Do you want me to make
you ----ing coffee?

04:15.964 --> 04:17.173
Like, what can I do?

04:17.215 --> 04:19.009
Because I really don’t
want you to leave.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.343
I don’t want Max to go.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.429
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:27.308 --> 04:29.352
Laundry, cabins.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.688
And if we can just do that,
we’ll be fine.

04:31.730 --> 04:32.564
Hi, Norma.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.482
You have some good news for me?

04:34.524 --> 04:36.276
We start charter tomorrow.

04:36.317 --> 04:38.987
So I’d need her on board
by then.

04:39.029 --> 04:40.363
Okay, great.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.322
Do you need some help?

04:41.364 --> 04:42.991
-Shut up.
-Come on.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.200
I’m kidding.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.577
No, you’re not.

04:49.164 --> 04:50.582
Copy.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.960
-Yeah.
-Let’s do this.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.128
-Hello.
-Hello.

04:55.170 --> 04:56.296
Charter number five.

04:56.338 --> 04:57.422
This will be a shorter charter.

04:57.464 --> 05:00.216
-Oh, my God.
-What?

05:00.258 --> 05:02.135
Shorter charter,
everything’s amplified.

05:02.177 --> 05:03.386
If you make a mistake,

05:03.428 --> 05:04.929
you do not have any time
to make up for it.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.057
You kind of have to be
perfect all the way through.

05:07.098 --> 05:08.224
[bleep]

05:08.266 --> 05:09.934
Tania DeCosimo,
primary charter guest,

05:09.976 --> 05:13.313
is the founder and editor
of P.OW.E.R. Magazine.

05:13.355 --> 05:14.564
She is celebrating her birthday

05:14.606 --> 05:16.524
with a group of
like-minded women

05:16.566 --> 05:19.152
to celebrate
women’s empowerment.

05:19.194 --> 05:20.403
Yay.

05:20.445 --> 05:21.446
The guest requests a
light and healthy lunch

05:21.488 --> 05:22.655
with various salads.

05:22.697 --> 05:25.575
Dinner theme is
an all-white party.

05:33.208 --> 05:35.377
That is ----ing
next level weird.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.337
How do you find out that
you don’t eat eggs outside?

05:37.379 --> 05:38.922
Like, what happened?

05:38.963 --> 05:40.590
Did, like, some seagull come and
eat your dinner or something?

05:40.632 --> 05:42.634
Like, how do you find that out?

05:42.676 --> 05:44.344
The guest would like to
get off the boat

05:44.386 --> 05:47.222
to explore the historic
town of Portofino.

05:47.263 --> 05:49.015
That’s awesome.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.183
Yeah, it’s cool.

05:50.225 --> 05:51.726
-We haven’t done that yet.
-No.

05:51.768 --> 05:54.229
Docking in Portofino on this
vessel will be a challenge.

05:54.270 --> 05:56.022
Very tight dock,
and I have to back it.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.607
What?

05:57.649 --> 06:00.276
We are going to spin that boat
right where everyone can see,

06:00.318 --> 06:02.445
and you’re going to talk us
right through

06:02.487 --> 06:04.030
-all those little boats?
-Yeah.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.490
-Me hitting nothing?
-No.

06:05.532 --> 06:06.533
-Into that dock?
-Exciting.

06:06.574 --> 06:07.951
That’s not going to be easy.

06:07.992 --> 06:12.163
Tumi, your new stew will
arrive tomorrow before charter.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.457
Oh.
I love that.

06:14.499 --> 06:15.709
All right, we’re going
to smash this out.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.794
Where the [bleep]
are the toothbrushes?

06:20.880 --> 06:22.590
Yeah.

06:24.968 --> 06:26.344
Natalya’s not here.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.221
I feel a bit sh--
because ----ing

06:28.263 --> 06:30.557
me best mate on the boat’s gone.

06:33.101 --> 06:36.271
That guy would cause drama in
an empty room with a mop bucket.

06:36.312 --> 06:37.939
All right, cool.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.399
Thank you, Cheffy.

06:39.441 --> 06:42.360
-Good job.
-Smashed it.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.945
-Yeah, yeah.
-I feel good.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.033
Well done.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.659
Thanks, honey.

07:01.838 --> 07:02.464
How you doing?

07:02.505 --> 07:03.673
I had a dream.

07:03.715 --> 07:06.259
And I punched you in
the face last night.

07:06.301 --> 07:07.594
That wasn’t a dream.

07:08.428 --> 07:11.473
Good morning.
All good?

07:12.182 --> 07:15.560
[laughing]

07:15.602 --> 07:17.812
Huh?
Sorry, I’m screaming.

07:34.329 --> 07:35.747
Yeah.

07:38.249 --> 07:39.918
Coming up...

07:39.959 --> 07:40.794
We’re going in.

07:40.835 --> 07:41.836
It’s a super high-end port.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.046
Million dollar boats everywhere.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.464
That’s ----ing stressful.

08:00.522 --> 08:00.772
Yeah.

08:03.441 --> 08:05.402
And like is not for me.

08:05.443 --> 08:08.113
We only have two and
a half weeks left.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.489
You leave, we’re shorthanded,

08:09.531 --> 08:11.616
probably for the rest
of the season.

08:15.286 --> 08:16.746
I need to wash things off.

08:22.085 --> 08:23.420
How’s that?

08:23.461 --> 08:25.338
Yeah, it’s cool, it’s cool.

08:25.380 --> 08:26.673
I’m not happy.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.846
[imitates rooster]

08:35.056 --> 08:36.182
Oh...

08:54.451 --> 08:56.161
Tumi, I’m going to miss you.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.620
I’m scared whoever comes next

08:57.662 --> 08:59.873
is going to be dirty
or something.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.585
You know, I really appreciate
you offering up

09:03.626 --> 09:04.878
a bigger room for me.

09:04.919 --> 09:06.629
There’s no offense
or weirdness.

09:06.671 --> 09:08.381
If you want to move to that
cabin, you let me know

09:08.423 --> 09:09.758
and I’ll swap with you.

09:09.799 --> 09:11.301
I know you’re not doing it
really for me,

09:11.343 --> 09:12.469
but you’re doing it for Luka.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.763
Now you’re one door away.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.598
Tumi, can you please
come to the bridge?

09:16.639 --> 09:18.850
You have a new stew
arriving today.

09:18.892 --> 09:19.809
Copy.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.396
-Morning.
-Hi.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.065
Here’s your new stewardess.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.733
Oh, my God.

09:30.612 --> 09:32.322
-So she’s green.
-Yeah.

09:32.364 --> 09:35.283
At this point, it is not easy
to get a high-level stew.

09:35.325 --> 09:38.036
Tumi will have to be very
clear in the direction

09:38.078 --> 09:39.287
that she gives Lily.

09:39.329 --> 09:40.372
She has some
hospitality experience,

09:40.413 --> 09:41.539
which is really great.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.208
She’s worked on a
few small boats,

09:43.249 --> 09:44.542
which is better than none.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.044
We’re in the middle
of the charter season.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.880
There really aren’t
a lot of crew around.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.006
Any minute.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.216
Okay, perfect.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.801
Oh, sh--.

09:58.139 --> 10:00.058
Oh, la, la.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.685
Hey, girl. How are you?
I’m Lara.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.228
Hi, I’m Lily.
Nice to meet you.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.562
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello. Welcome on board.

10:04.604 --> 10:05.980
Hi, I’m Lily.
Nice to meet you.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.315
Nice to meet you.

10:07.357 --> 10:08.983
I meant to go to the
bridge straight away, so...

10:09.025 --> 10:10.276
Yeah.
What’s your name again?

10:10.318 --> 10:11.236
-Lily.
-Lily.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.737
Nice to meet you.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.989
Wow.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.409
Oh.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.868
-Hi, I’m Haileigh.
-Nice to meet you.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.328
Go up these stairs.
It’s the first door on the left.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.288
Thank you.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.084
-Hi.
-Hello.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.085
Welcome aboard.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.420
Thank you for coming.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.754
-Thank you for having me.
-Yeah, nice to meet you.

10:29.796 --> 10:30.922
Nice to meet you.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.007
Tumi.

10:34.801 --> 10:35.802
Hi.

10:36.678 --> 10:39.222
Tumi, Lily.

10:39.264 --> 10:41.474
Yeah, perfect.

10:41.516 --> 10:42.892
Today.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.692
I grew up in Windsor, like,
20 miles from London.

10:50.734 --> 10:53.153
There’s obviously
Windsor Castle there,

10:53.194 --> 10:54.863
where, like,
Harry and Meghan got married.

10:54.904 --> 10:57.782
Throughout university for, like,
the last four or five years,

10:57.824 --> 11:00.243
I was working at
key events in England,

11:00.285 --> 11:01.786
be it Royal Ascot, Wimbledon.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.246
Hi, nice to meet you.
I’m Lily.

11:03.288 --> 11:05.707
Jessika.

11:05.749 --> 11:07.792
This is my first yacht
that I’ve worked on.

11:07.834 --> 11:11.254
My last boat was at Catamaran,
45 foot, way smaller.

11:11.296 --> 11:12.297
Your room is...

11:12.339 --> 11:13.631
Kyle’s actually moving out.

11:13.673 --> 11:14.966
I’m just cleaning up
all the bad memories

11:15.008 --> 11:16.801
so you can create new ones.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.428
I’ve never worked on
a boat this big.

11:18.470 --> 11:21.056
I’m literally sh--ting myself.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.974
No, no, wait.
Not literally.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.100
You never know.

11:24.142 --> 11:25.727
So you’ll just wear
that T-shirt.

11:25.769 --> 11:28.188
I’m probably going to get
you to do a quick vacuum.

11:28.229 --> 11:29.272
Perfect.

11:29.314 --> 11:31.316
-Bro.
-Yeah.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.317
She cute?

11:32.359 --> 11:34.027
What’s her name?

11:36.029 --> 11:38.740
She must be cute if you came
all the way up here to tell me.

11:38.782 --> 11:40.367
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.701
I’m excited, man.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.662
Guess who’s
the common denominator?

11:44.704 --> 11:46.373
You can’t control your
emotions.

11:46.414 --> 11:47.874
You’re nasty.
And that’s why I’m leaving.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.501
You need to speak
a certain way...

11:49.542 --> 11:51.002
I’ve never been spoken
like that in my life.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.921
I don’t want a person like you.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.798
This is killing me right now.

11:54.839 --> 11:57.133
All that is happening,
all that has happened.

11:57.175 --> 12:00.428
I don’t want Captain Sandy to
have this perception of me.

12:00.470 --> 12:01.846
And I need to fix this.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.431
At least you guys are good.

12:03.473 --> 12:04.891
Yeah, we’re very good.

12:04.933 --> 12:08.103
You’ve got a good vibe.
So I’m happy for you guys.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.854
Thanks, bro.

12:19.322 --> 12:20.740
Okay.

12:24.327 --> 12:25.578
-She never...
-Never once.

12:25.620 --> 12:26.788
She was only just
positive about it.

12:26.830 --> 12:29.374
I know. I know.
That’s ----ing bull.

12:29.416 --> 12:34.254
Cap, I want to say I, from
the bottom of my heart,

12:34.295 --> 12:38.133
am truly apologetic
for what I have done.

12:38.174 --> 12:41.720
And the way I allowed
myself to react,

12:41.761 --> 12:43.972
I let my emotions get
the best of me.

12:44.014 --> 12:47.225
I have gone to Natalya
and had apologized.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.601
I’m not going to blame
it on being drunk.

12:48.643 --> 12:50.020
I’m not going to
blame or anything.

12:50.061 --> 12:53.898
If you ever want to re-charts,
you know where I am.

13:05.035 --> 13:06.494
Just that.

13:06.536 --> 13:08.079
I can control all of it.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.247
-You got it.
-Thank you, Captain.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.081
Thank you.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.249
What he did was not okay,

13:11.291 --> 13:13.376
but Kyle gets an
opportunity to change.

13:13.418 --> 13:14.502
Thank you.

13:16.296 --> 13:19.924
All crew, all crew,
guest arrival is in 30 minutes.

13:20.800 --> 13:21.676
-Hi.
-Hello.

13:21.718 --> 13:22.927
Hi. Nice to meet you. I’m Lily.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.429
I’m Jack. Yeah, yeah.
Another Brit.

13:37.859 --> 13:39.486
So when guests come on...

13:43.114 --> 13:44.115
What’s the radio thing again?

13:44.157 --> 13:45.533
You just click that button.

13:45.575 --> 13:47.869
-We’ll be fine.
-Okay.

13:47.911 --> 13:49.037
All crew, all crew, guest
arrival,

13:49.079 --> 13:50.330
let’s meet on the dock.

13:50.372 --> 13:52.082
Right.
I’ve gone the wrong way again.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.834
We got this.

13:56.503 --> 13:57.629
Oh, my God.

13:57.671 --> 13:59.798
They’re going to
tease the boys.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.633
Oh, my God.

14:01.675 --> 14:02.967
How beautiful, right?

14:03.009 --> 14:04.719
-Hello.
-Welcome aboard.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.262
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

14:06.304 --> 14:07.430
Hi. I’m Jess.

14:07.472 --> 14:08.640
Hi, you’re so pretty.

14:08.682 --> 14:09.933
Hi, I’m Lily.
Nice to meet you.

14:09.974 --> 14:10.975
Pleasure to meet you as well.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.143
We’re so happy to have you.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.645
Tumi’s going to
show you around.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.772
-Welcome aboard.
-Thank you.

14:15.814 --> 14:17.565
-Yeah, we’ll get that luggage.
-Yeah.

14:20.402 --> 14:22.237
-This is walking the plank.
-Your welcome drink.

14:22.278 --> 14:23.488
Cheers, ladies.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.073
To a bunch of power women.

14:25.115 --> 14:27.242
-Holy sh--.
-Oh, my God.

14:28.451 --> 14:30.203
Oh, how beautiful.

14:30.245 --> 14:31.663
I’ll have a shot of tequila.

14:31.705 --> 14:34.124
I love that you love tequila.

14:34.165 --> 14:35.667
[grunting]

14:35.709 --> 14:36.835
This is our master cabin.

14:36.876 --> 14:37.877
Oh, very nice.

14:37.919 --> 14:39.254
And we are sleeping
together, girls.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.673
What happens on
the boat stays on the boat.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.758
What time would you like lunch?

14:43.800 --> 14:45.719
-Within the hour.
-One hour.

14:45.760 --> 14:46.636
Anyone I miss?

14:46.678 --> 14:47.846
You forgot my name already.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.347
-Babe.
-No, babe, my name is Marcie.

14:49.389 --> 14:50.598
-That’s my real name.
-Got you.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.892
Oh, can you iron my underwear?

14:52.934 --> 14:55.353
Deck crew, deck crew.
Prepare for departure.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.396
-Change first.
-Yeah.

14:56.438 --> 14:57.605
Okay.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.445
-Captain.
-Nice to see you again.

15:03.486 --> 15:05.321
Cheffy, lunch, one hour.

15:05.363 --> 15:07.282
-Release the stern.
-This one, please.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.242
All stern lines are in.

15:09.284 --> 15:10.410
All right, let’s go.

15:10.452 --> 15:12.078
Watch that corner.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.330
Another three meters ahead and
we’ll be out of go to starboard.

15:14.372 --> 15:16.082
Eight meters
to the ground lines

15:16.124 --> 15:17.125
on your starboard side.

15:17.167 --> 15:18.710
We can start spinning.

15:18.752 --> 15:19.919
Great job, Lukey.

15:19.961 --> 15:23.340
-Nice one, girls.
-Nice work.

15:23.381 --> 15:25.717
-That was smooth.
-Yeah, very smooth.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.469
-I was doing the fender up.
-Nice.

15:27.510 --> 15:31.056
-Kyle.
-Hi, honey buns.

15:36.603 --> 15:37.896
Got you, honey bun.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.065
So it takes a second.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.608
Like, it takes a minute.

15:42.567 --> 15:43.860
I know how to do it.

15:43.902 --> 15:45.737
I’m a fast learner because
I had to do it

15:45.779 --> 15:48.907
my whole life at university
without going to any lectures

15:48.948 --> 15:50.992
and still getting,
like, the great grades.

15:51.034 --> 15:52.702
Just gliding over.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.043
-Thank you.
-You’re welcome.

16:00.085 --> 16:02.587
Great weekend, guys.
No work, right?

16:02.629 --> 16:03.963
-No work.
-Oh, my goodness.

16:04.005 --> 16:06.341
This is so nice.

16:06.383 --> 16:07.634
So...

16:08.802 --> 16:10.261
-Lily.
-Yeah.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.180
It’s for the first time
that she’s steaming.

16:12.222 --> 16:15.225
Doesn’t know how to steam.

16:15.266 --> 16:16.643
Yeah.

16:16.685 --> 16:18.395
[bleep]

16:18.436 --> 16:19.354
Coming up...

16:19.396 --> 16:21.106
Kyle, Kyle. Sandy.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.440
Go ahead, Captain.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.235
I just want to make sure
my underwear and my socks

16:35.453 --> 16:36.579
All crew, all crew, ETA,
one hour and 15 minutes.

16:37.539 --> 16:38.623
Are you ready for lunch?

16:38.665 --> 16:40.208
-Yes!
-Yes!

16:40.250 --> 16:41.292
Amazing!

16:41.334 --> 16:42.585
Hon!

16:42.627 --> 16:43.670
Yes.

16:43.712 --> 16:44.838
Oh, my God,
I’m sweating in here.

16:44.879 --> 16:45.880
It’s hot in here, eh?

16:45.922 --> 16:47.340
You’re staying.

16:47.382 --> 16:48.717
I’m going to hide your tweezers
so you can’t leave.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.176
He doesn’t have tweezers.

16:50.218 --> 16:52.137
He’s using my tweezers
all the time.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.555
I’ll sit here then.

17:01.646 --> 17:03.982
What I’m going to do is put my
head down and continue to work,

17:04.024 --> 17:05.483
but I feel standing across Jack

17:05.525 --> 17:07.110
that he has a few things
that he needs to say,

17:07.152 --> 17:08.528
but he doesn’t want to say it.

17:08.570 --> 17:12.198
I think Jack holds me as
the sole accountable person

17:12.240 --> 17:15.410
for pushing Natalya
off the boat.

17:16.995 --> 17:18.288
Egg-free, yeah.

17:18.329 --> 17:19.706
Normally, one would say
the silence is deafening,

17:19.748 --> 17:23.043
but the silence speaks
a multitude of words.

17:23.084 --> 17:24.461
-Onion salad?
-Thank you.

17:24.502 --> 17:28.631
Quinoa salad.
Egg-free, by the way, yeah?

17:28.673 --> 17:30.383
That’s fantastic.

17:30.425 --> 17:32.010
This is wonderful.
Thank you.

17:32.052 --> 17:33.261
Of course.

17:33.303 --> 17:35.013
Lily, I’ll meet you
in the laundry.

17:35.055 --> 17:36.014
Copy.

17:36.056 --> 17:37.432
Ah!

17:37.474 --> 17:39.934
-What’s happening?
-What’s happening?

17:39.976 --> 17:41.728
I’m going on break.

17:45.190 --> 17:47.359
We need alone time.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.402
Max, come to the bridge.
Max, to the bridge.

17:49.444 --> 17:51.363
-Copy.
-Love you, Max.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.156
Love you to the moon and back.

17:58.119 --> 18:00.372
Should we go lay out
by the jacuzzi?

18:01.289 --> 18:02.832
All right, I’m going
to the bathroom.

18:02.874 --> 18:03.792
Have fun.

18:06.544 --> 18:10.048
So when you’re drying
anything that’s guest,

18:10.090 --> 18:11.257
it should be hung.

18:11.299 --> 18:13.218
Stain treating.
Spray.

18:13.259 --> 18:14.719
-Mm-hmm.
-You go like that.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.054
Mm-hmm.

18:16.096 --> 18:17.472
It is really difficult
doing training and service

18:17.514 --> 18:19.599
at the same time,
especially on a busy boat.

18:19.641 --> 18:21.434
I don’t think I ever had
a chief stew train me

18:21.476 --> 18:23.269
because the chief
was busy with service.

18:23.311 --> 18:24.854
Galley rags never
go with our rags.

18:24.896 --> 18:26.231
Mm-hmm.

18:26.272 --> 18:29.192
I just need Lily to succeed
ASAP Rocky ASAP Pronto.

18:29.234 --> 18:31.444
I never thought I’d say this,
but I do miss Natalya.

18:31.486 --> 18:34.531
Not for her mouth,
but for her skill.

18:36.825 --> 18:38.284
No, don’t worry.

18:38.326 --> 18:41.287
Let’s make my
experience stronger.

18:41.329 --> 18:43.998
So the idea is to anchor
right on that anchor.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.083
Okay.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.293
You can turn it.
I’ll work this.

18:47.335 --> 18:50.463
Okay, so we’re turning.

18:50.505 --> 18:53.675
Great. Back to center.
Back to midship. Yeah.

19:04.561 --> 19:06.146
You’re going to tell him
drop anchor.

19:06.187 --> 19:08.148
Luka, Max,
you can drop the anchor.

19:08.189 --> 19:09.566
Copy.

19:14.529 --> 19:16.740
That is five shackles
at the waterline.

19:16.781 --> 19:17.866
Woo-hoo!

19:19.617 --> 19:21.327
Thank you, Captain.

19:23.204 --> 19:24.581
Deck crew, all toys out.

19:24.622 --> 19:26.958
2 p.m. we’re hauling our anchor.

19:28.918 --> 19:30.170
-Here we go.
-Thank you, thank you.

19:30.211 --> 19:31.629
Of course.

19:31.671 --> 19:32.714
Cheers.

19:41.097 --> 19:42.432
-Hello.
-Hello.

19:42.474 --> 19:44.517
I just wanted to talk to
you about the water toys.

19:44.559 --> 19:46.603
I’m not going to do
a slide right now.

19:46.644 --> 19:48.897
We can go swimming
and we’ve got a sea bob.

19:48.938 --> 19:50.190
Not right now.

19:50.231 --> 19:52.776
Then I’m probably going
to go in the shade.

19:52.817 --> 19:53.735
Yeah. Awesome.

19:53.777 --> 19:54.861
So they’re going
to go to shore.

19:54.903 --> 19:55.945
Do you want to go?

19:55.987 --> 19:57.405
Yeah, I’ll go.

19:57.447 --> 19:58.865
So what do we do?
Are we just waiting?

19:58.907 --> 20:00.450
Yeah. Pretty much.

20:00.492 --> 20:03.286
-What do you want to do?
-Have another coffee.

20:03.328 --> 20:04.496
Usually, when we drop anchor,

20:04.537 --> 20:06.539
guests are down
at the swim platform

20:06.581 --> 20:08.333
immediately because
they want to swim.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.293
They want to have fun.
But with them...

20:10.335 --> 20:11.670
This is all I need.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.922
Looks like these women
just booked a water taxi

20:13.963 --> 20:15.548
from Genoa to Portofino.

20:15.590 --> 20:19.469
A ----ing 55-meter
yacht water taxi.

20:19.511 --> 20:22.472
-I need a little sun.
-Not on my face.

20:23.390 --> 20:24.599
Lily, Lily, Tumi.

20:24.641 --> 20:26.351
-Could you go on your break?
-Copy.

20:26.393 --> 20:28.395
Luka.
Did anyone use a slide yet?

20:28.436 --> 20:29.479
No.

20:29.521 --> 20:31.231
You know, a big part of
the job for Luka

20:31.272 --> 20:32.649
is selling the toys
to the guests.

20:32.691 --> 20:35.193
That’s why we buy all
this stuff to make sure

20:35.235 --> 20:36.653
the clients get to play on it.

20:36.695 --> 20:38.822
-You got to encourage them.
-Yeah.

20:38.863 --> 20:40.365
-Get them excited.
-Yeah.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.325
I just need to give
him a gentle reminder.

20:42.367 --> 20:44.244
Be that energy for the client.

20:44.285 --> 20:46.538
We got to use the toys.

20:47.664 --> 20:48.957
Are you going to go
down the slide?

20:48.998 --> 20:50.375
That is fun.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.002
And Luka will even show
you how to do it.

20:52.043 --> 20:53.628
-I’m going to do it.
-Marcie, are you coming with me?

20:53.670 --> 20:55.296
I’m coming with you.
Come on.

20:55.338 --> 20:56.256
-Because this is fun.
-Yeah.

20:56.297 --> 20:57.716
Max, Max, Luka.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.551
Can you come up to the
bridge deck aft, please?

20:59.592 --> 21:00.969
Yeah, man.

21:01.011 --> 21:02.262
It’s so much fun.

21:02.303 --> 21:03.763
Come on.
We got this.

21:03.805 --> 21:06.057
Max, you’re going to show
the ladies how it’s done.

21:06.099 --> 21:08.435
Do the dive?

21:11.146 --> 21:12.564
Oh!

21:14.983 --> 21:15.942
You got this.

21:15.984 --> 21:18.111
-Woo!
-Woo!

21:18.153 --> 21:19.779
-So brave.
-Wasn’t that fun?

21:22.657 --> 21:24.951
Lily!
Are you on your break?

21:24.993 --> 21:27.370
-Yeah.
-Good.

21:27.412 --> 21:28.705
Hey, how do I get outside?

21:28.747 --> 21:30.582
You. Come.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.586
Just watch your head.

21:37.339 --> 21:38.548
I was not expecting this.

21:38.590 --> 21:39.632
They’re happy.
They’re smiling.

21:39.674 --> 21:41.217
They’re enjoying themselves.

21:41.259 --> 21:43.553
I think I would be
all right on a jet ski.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.473
Sandy motivated me to get
these guys in the water

21:46.514 --> 21:48.892
is exactly what we needed.

21:48.933 --> 21:50.560
Oh, my God.

21:51.394 --> 21:53.146
Welcome at your place.

21:53.188 --> 21:54.939
Oh, this is comfy.

22:01.196 --> 22:02.322
Where’s the barbecue?

22:02.364 --> 22:04.282
I can’t tell
you all the secrets.

22:04.324 --> 22:05.492
You are here for the first day.

22:05.533 --> 22:06.868
I need to trust you first.

22:19.881 --> 22:23.009
English people can do American
accents, like, so easily.

22:23.051 --> 22:25.345
Like, yeah.

22:25.387 --> 22:26.846
Pick me up.

22:26.888 --> 22:29.349
Deck crew, deck crew,
bring the water toys in.

22:29.391 --> 22:30.767
Love.

22:33.228 --> 22:34.854
-Voila.
-All good?

22:34.896 --> 22:36.022
Yeah, man.

22:36.064 --> 22:37.232
Let’s get it.

22:37.273 --> 22:38.775
Anchor up. Anchor up.

22:40.443 --> 22:42.487
Anchor at home.

22:42.529 --> 22:44.489
Nice job, Max.
Thank you.

22:44.531 --> 22:45.990
You’re making coffee for you?

22:46.032 --> 22:47.158
No, it’s for chef.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.201
I’m already doing the dishes.

22:48.243 --> 22:49.619
Now I must make coffee, too?

22:52.163 --> 22:53.623
Okay, I’m going to the front.

22:53.665 --> 22:55.125
I’m going to help Frenchie.

22:55.166 --> 22:56.209
Oh, yeah, you’re up forward.

22:56.251 --> 22:57.210
I’ll be at the back with H.

22:57.252 --> 22:58.211
Okay.

22:58.253 --> 22:59.504
Oh, look at you.

22:59.546 --> 23:00.797
Looking after your chef.

23:00.839 --> 23:02.257
Team morale. Don’t come and
bullsh-- me

23:02.298 --> 23:04.676
about team morale.

23:04.718 --> 23:07.095
We’re just going to get changed
and get ready for the Portofino.

23:07.137 --> 23:08.805
I got to get ready.

23:16.229 --> 23:17.480
Copy.

23:17.522 --> 23:19.733
Docking a boat in Portofino
is very difficult.

23:19.774 --> 23:21.776
It’s narrow, especially
in a big boat.

23:21.818 --> 23:23.903
You have to spin the
boat around on a dime.

23:23.945 --> 23:26.740
She’s going to turn the boat,
and she’s going to reverse it.

23:26.781 --> 23:29.284
And then back down
this narrow area

23:29.325 --> 23:31.494
to get to that one piece of dock

23:31.536 --> 23:33.413
that you have that’s
like this big,

23:33.455 --> 23:35.915
with all these boats
coming out oblivious

23:35.957 --> 23:37.375
of what you have to do.

23:37.417 --> 23:39.836
So we go straight in
there on that empty dock.

23:39.878 --> 23:43.882
Every ounce of my trust
is in my deck team.

23:43.923 --> 23:45.383
That is the only way
I can pull this off.

23:45.425 --> 23:47.844
Whoo!
Let’s do this.

23:49.637 --> 23:51.723
Copy.
Bow to Port.

23:55.810 --> 23:58.480
You’ve got a good line
here directly astern.

23:58.521 --> 24:00.857
The port boat,
he’s waving us in now.

24:00.899 --> 24:03.068
The ferry’s coming
in towards your port bow.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.362
I think he’s going to try
and get in before us.

24:05.403 --> 24:07.614
Small boat on your
port midships.

24:07.655 --> 24:10.158
10 meters to the sailing
on our starboard side.

24:10.200 --> 24:11.618
It’s a super high-end port.

24:11.659 --> 24:14.079
There’s million-dollar boats
everywhere

24:14.120 --> 24:15.580
with inches
on either side.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.332
That’s ----ing stressful.

24:17.374 --> 24:19.918
Captain Sandy
reversing like this?

24:26.966 --> 24:27.801
You have 75 meters
to the dock.

24:29.552 --> 24:31.471
Backing it in, Captain Sandy.

24:31.513 --> 24:33.348
That’s like amazing,
something else.

24:33.390 --> 24:35.016
Small boat on your
port midship.

24:35.058 --> 24:37.686
10 meters to the sailing
yacht on our starboard side.

24:37.727 --> 24:39.270
We’re going to
clear them nicely,

24:39.312 --> 24:41.564
and you’re going to clear all
the boats on our port side

24:41.606 --> 24:43.358
with seven meters.

24:43.400 --> 24:44.818
This is pretty cool.

24:47.237 --> 24:48.488
Okay.

24:48.530 --> 24:49.906
They don’t have ground lines
in Portofino,

24:49.948 --> 24:52.659
so we have to drop both
of our anchors, pull up on them,

24:52.701 --> 24:54.411
and that’s going to give
us our tension.

24:54.452 --> 24:56.079
And we’ve never done this
before.

24:57.414 --> 24:59.082
Drop, drop, drop.

25:02.002 --> 25:03.920
50 meters to the dock
directly astern.

25:03.962 --> 25:06.297
[bleep]. Look how many people
are on that.

25:06.339 --> 25:08.258
-Oh, my God.
-So gorgeous.

25:08.299 --> 25:09.968
Let’s get that fender down.

25:11.302 --> 25:13.555
10 meters to the dock.

25:13.596 --> 25:15.557
Okay, chuck the springs.

25:15.598 --> 25:17.600
We’ve got our stern lines on.

25:17.642 --> 25:19.853
Now they can start
pulling up on the anchors.

25:22.397 --> 25:24.566
We’ve got a medium stay.

25:24.607 --> 25:26.067
Okay, we’re looking good.

25:27.610 --> 25:28.570
Good job, Max.

25:28.611 --> 25:30.739
This is so ----ing cool.

25:30.780 --> 25:34.075
I just anchored
55 meters boats.

25:34.117 --> 25:35.285
How about you?

25:35.326 --> 25:37.871
Nothing went wrong.
The boat’s secure.

25:39.289 --> 25:40.665
[vocalizing]

25:40.707 --> 25:43.084
You dropped all this
----ing sh-- in the water.

25:43.126 --> 25:44.252
I love it, bro.

25:44.294 --> 25:46.212
You guys did awesome.

25:46.254 --> 25:47.297
You killed it!

25:47.339 --> 25:48.340
Bye.

25:48.381 --> 25:49.758
Ciao, take care.

25:49.799 --> 25:51.426
-Bye.
-Enjoy Italia.

25:51.468 --> 25:53.386
-See you.
-Bye.

25:53.428 --> 25:55.555
-Have fun.
-This way, ladies.

25:55.597 --> 25:57.682
Could have gave me
like a little note.

25:57.724 --> 25:58.975
Hey, guys, wear sneakers.

25:59.017 --> 26:01.978
I bought Louis Gucci
All High Heels.

26:02.020 --> 26:03.313
I’m treating you to
some ice cream.

26:03.355 --> 26:04.689
Aw.

26:04.731 --> 26:06.941
Because you did an awesome
job on the docking.

26:06.983 --> 26:08.610
So good.

26:08.651 --> 26:09.903
Everyone deserves an ice cream.

26:09.944 --> 26:11.780
They had never dropped
anchors before to dock.

26:11.821 --> 26:13.865
They have never been
in Portofino.

26:13.907 --> 26:16.242
It is hard.
That’s some scary sh--.

26:16.284 --> 26:17.452
This is a treat.

26:17.494 --> 26:18.620
Move a little closer
to each other.

26:18.661 --> 26:20.080
Like we like each other?

26:20.121 --> 26:20.830
Yeah.

26:20.872 --> 26:22.624
Dinner.
We need a menu.

26:22.665 --> 26:24.042
So we’re doing steamed clams.

26:24.084 --> 26:25.877
With white wine sauce,
emphasis on the white here,

26:25.919 --> 26:27.295
because it’s a white party.

26:27.337 --> 26:30.674
White Bolognese, smoked
salmon in white sauce.

26:30.715 --> 26:33.176
Any chance I can get
the word white in

26:33.218 --> 26:34.302
I’m going to do it.

26:34.344 --> 26:35.929
-Perfect. Thanks.
-All right, cheers.

26:37.931 --> 26:39.432
We’re going to hang a
right here.

26:39.474 --> 26:40.850
Ice cream.

26:40.892 --> 26:43.645
It’s good to have the team here,
speaking together.

26:43.687 --> 26:45.563
I’m staying, guys.

26:45.605 --> 26:46.690
Thank you.

26:46.731 --> 26:49.150
You’re joking!

26:49.192 --> 26:50.527
I’m sorry, bro.

26:50.568 --> 26:53.029
Oh, you just made my day.

26:56.783 --> 26:58.451
You can’t leave us, mate.

26:58.493 --> 26:59.828
I’m going to miss you.

27:12.257 --> 27:13.258
let’s go.

27:13.299 --> 27:14.259
Yeah, we’re happy.

27:14.300 --> 27:15.635
That’s good news, bro.

27:15.677 --> 27:18.388
So this is a torch mackerel.
That’s one dish.

27:18.430 --> 27:19.389
-And then beef fillets.
-Yeah.

27:19.431 --> 27:20.390
Copy. Cool.

27:20.432 --> 27:21.516
Yeah.

27:21.558 --> 27:22.767
-Oh, wow.
-Oh, my goodness.

27:22.809 --> 27:25.520
-What did you get?
-Vanilla and coffee.

27:25.562 --> 27:26.521
I got brain freeze.

27:26.563 --> 27:27.731
Wow, this is cool.

27:27.772 --> 27:31.735
-Not Gucci. Pucci.
-Yeah, Pucci.

27:31.776 --> 27:33.486
Marcie’s living her best life.

27:33.528 --> 27:35.405
Mmm.

27:35.447 --> 27:36.698
[Max vocalizing]

27:36.740 --> 27:38.658
One good ice cream,
one good sleep.

27:38.700 --> 27:39.701
Yeah, that was good.

27:39.743 --> 27:40.827
Do you guys have any washing?

27:40.869 --> 27:42.537
-Yeah, I might.
-Do you want to do some?

27:42.579 --> 27:43.997
Yeah, you can give me stuff.

27:44.039 --> 27:46.374
I just don’t see much
washing for other people,

27:46.416 --> 27:47.792
unless I do my own.

27:47.834 --> 27:49.502
I need my underwear back.

27:49.544 --> 27:51.379
-Are you okay?
-Oh, no, I’m fine.

27:51.421 --> 27:53.256
I just washed so much stuff.

27:53.298 --> 27:55.216
Where is everybody?

27:55.258 --> 27:56.634
Kyle, Kyle, Sandy.

27:56.676 --> 27:57.969
Go ahead, Captain.

27:58.011 --> 28:00.555
I just want to make sure
my underwear and my socks

28:00.597 --> 28:02.140
make it back to my cabin.

28:02.182 --> 28:06.770
I got my shirt, but I don’t
know where the other items are.

28:08.021 --> 28:09.773
[laughing]

28:12.108 --> 28:13.735
Oh, my God.
Oh, my ----ing.

28:13.777 --> 28:15.862
-On my way.
-[bleep] my life.

28:15.904 --> 28:18.698
[bleep], [bleep], [bleep],
[bleep], [bleep], [bleep].

28:18.740 --> 28:20.367
Oh my God.
Ah!

28:20.408 --> 28:21.701
[laughing]

28:21.743 --> 28:24.412
-That’s not mine.
-Those ones aren’t mine.

28:24.454 --> 28:25.872
Thank you, honey.

28:25.914 --> 28:28.583
You know, you get green,
and then you get,

28:28.625 --> 28:31.419
I don’t know what type of
shade green this is, girl.

28:31.461 --> 28:33.254
I just want to know
where my underwear are.

28:33.296 --> 28:35.131
So I found two socks.

28:35.173 --> 28:37.842
-I apologize.
-No, seriously. It’s okay.

28:37.884 --> 28:39.886
I put it in the wash
but I didn’t take it out.

28:39.928 --> 28:42.472
-Don’t worry.
-Okay, it won’t happen again.

28:42.514 --> 28:44.224
Okay, is this yours as well?

28:44.265 --> 28:46.726
-Uh, no.
-No.

28:46.768 --> 28:48.603
After you, ladies.

28:48.645 --> 28:51.272
-You good?
-I’m good.

28:51.314 --> 28:52.273
That was great.

28:52.315 --> 28:53.191
There you go.

28:56.111 --> 28:57.529
Go on, girl.

28:57.570 --> 29:00.281
Go get changed.

29:08.623 --> 29:09.791
----ing silent treatment.

29:09.833 --> 29:11.292
I feel like in high school.

29:11.334 --> 29:12.585
Just give me
a shout to come down.

29:12.627 --> 29:13.795
It’s going to be a few.

29:13.837 --> 29:15.171
And now I find myself
wondering

29:15.213 --> 29:16.923
what has been said
behind my back.

29:16.965 --> 29:19.968
This is not sustainable
for the rest of the season.

29:21.344 --> 29:22.929
Wow.

29:25.432 --> 29:27.767
-Party, party.
-Ooh, la la.

29:27.809 --> 29:30.228
Everyone is coming
to my wedding.

29:30.270 --> 29:32.480
Beautiful.
Wow.

29:32.522 --> 29:34.899
Oh, my God.
This is gorgeous.

29:34.941 --> 29:37.444
Right, Cheffy, the guests
are seated at the table.

29:37.485 --> 29:40.071
Muchas gracias.

29:40.113 --> 29:41.489
Pop it on the bar there, please.

29:41.531 --> 29:44.659
So, we have a white asparagus
and pomegranate salad.

29:44.701 --> 29:46.286
White Bolognese.

29:46.327 --> 29:50.290
Smoked salmon orecchiette and
white wine sauce with capers.

29:50.331 --> 29:51.624
Oh.

29:51.666 --> 29:54.669
-Would you like some?
-Orecchiette is the hats.

29:54.711 --> 29:55.920
He knows best.

29:55.962 --> 29:58.506
-That’s so good.
-It’s delicious.

29:58.548 --> 29:59.549
-Lily.
-Yeah?

29:59.591 --> 30:00.884
Missed a spot.

30:00.925 --> 30:03.511
Jess and Lily, how are
the cabins going?

30:03.553 --> 30:04.763
Decent.

30:04.804 --> 30:06.389
We just have to vacuum the
floors

30:06.431 --> 30:08.350
and we’re just having some
technical difficulties with

30:08.391 --> 30:11.686
one of the showers and we just
have to clean one more head.

30:11.728 --> 30:13.355
-Great.
-Very great.

30:13.396 --> 30:16.399
-Can you throw that in there?
-Yeah.

30:16.441 --> 30:17.984
Well, you know, coming
in mid-charter,

30:18.026 --> 30:19.319
not having this type
of yacht experience.

30:19.361 --> 30:20.987
Yeah, it’s a lot.

30:21.029 --> 30:23.990
With Lily’s lack of experience,
she can’t do beds on her own.

30:24.032 --> 30:25.617
She can’t do anything
on her own.

30:25.658 --> 30:27.869
So, that means that she needs
more of Jess’s help,

30:27.911 --> 30:29.788
which then takes Jess
away from me.

30:29.829 --> 30:31.122
So, I just need to figure out
a way to, like,

30:31.164 --> 30:32.791
try sort this out for
the next charter.

30:32.832 --> 30:35.126
Find what Lily does really,
really well

30:35.168 --> 30:36.336
and just focus on that.

30:36.378 --> 30:37.629
-Cheffy.
-Yeah.

30:37.671 --> 30:38.922
-Well.
-Thank you.

30:38.963 --> 30:39.923
-Happy.
-Yeah.

30:39.964 --> 30:41.549
I really want to
enjoy this night.

30:41.591 --> 30:43.551
So, that means we need
to really turn it up.

30:43.593 --> 30:44.636
-Chippendales.
-Chippendales.

30:44.678 --> 30:45.970
That’s who we want.

30:46.012 --> 30:47.597
We just need a couple
of the guys inside.

30:47.639 --> 30:48.640
They’re going to strip.

30:48.682 --> 30:49.974
I’m going to organize that.

30:50.016 --> 30:51.851
Thank you so much.

30:51.893 --> 30:53.603
[laughing]

30:58.566 --> 31:00.610
-No, no, no, no.
-Come on, boys.

31:00.652 --> 31:01.986
Luka?

31:03.780 --> 31:05.073
Only get Marcie’s
credit card.

31:15.166 --> 31:19.087
I’ve done some stripping
on other boats in the past.

31:19.129 --> 31:20.714
Oh!

31:23.341 --> 31:25.635
All right. Yeah. Where’s those
little white things?

31:25.677 --> 31:29.347
I will get you two.
Yes.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.020
Excited.

31:38.189 --> 31:40.525
Do you mind if I borrow
this for a second?

31:40.567 --> 31:42.318
-You have to do it.
-No.

31:43.236 --> 31:44.779
Why have I got roped into it?

31:44.821 --> 31:46.197
Look at a ----ing
Luka and Max.

31:46.239 --> 31:47.282
They’re models, for God’s sake.

31:47.323 --> 31:49.075
Shimmy, shimmy,
yeah, yeah.

31:49.117 --> 31:51.327
I’m a lot of things, but
I’m not a ----ing model.

31:51.369 --> 31:52.328
[trilling]

31:52.370 --> 31:53.913
The guys are coming.
Here we go.

31:53.955 --> 31:54.914
Hot baby.

31:54.956 --> 31:56.708
[trilling]

32:12.140 --> 32:13.016
The guys are coming,
here we go.

32:13.600 --> 32:15.018
Hey, baby!

32:15.060 --> 32:16.686
[shouting]

32:21.149 --> 32:25.320
If I take my clothes off,
it might hurt the tip.

32:30.658 --> 32:32.243
Hey, hey, oh!

32:36.581 --> 32:38.625
Hello.

32:38.667 --> 32:40.418
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

32:41.920 --> 32:44.339
Luka is a very attractive man.

32:44.381 --> 32:45.757
Thank you!

32:45.799 --> 32:48.885
It’s been a while since
I’ve seen things that hot.

32:48.927 --> 32:51.429
Oh, my God, how funny is that?

32:51.471 --> 32:53.181
Oh, my God!

32:53.223 --> 32:55.141
Now I’m going to bed.

32:55.892 --> 32:58.395
Party in my room.

32:58.436 --> 32:59.771
Okay, I need to go to bed.

33:01.606 --> 33:04.192
When you take this down
to laundry before you go,

33:04.234 --> 33:07.362
just label tablecloth.

33:07.404 --> 33:08.697
[laughing]

33:10.907 --> 33:13.910
-I’ll see you tomorrow.
-See you later.

33:13.952 --> 33:15.245
Good night.

33:21.501 --> 33:23.586
Sh--.

33:23.628 --> 33:26.172
-No, way.
-No, way.

33:27.966 --> 33:30.218
I think Jess is super easygoing.

33:30.260 --> 33:31.636
Kind of like me,
like just chill.

33:34.222 --> 33:36.099
Maybe a little bit shy.

33:36.141 --> 33:37.726
She’s not in
an open relationship,

33:37.767 --> 33:38.893
which is a good sign.

33:38.935 --> 33:41.187
I just want to cuddle, bro.

33:44.774 --> 33:46.484
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

33:49.070 --> 33:50.363
[alarm sounds]

33:58.163 --> 33:59.330
I love these.

33:59.372 --> 34:00.373
These look so numa.

34:00.415 --> 34:02.625
-You ready to party?
-No.

34:02.667 --> 34:04.127
Morning.

34:04.169 --> 34:08.423
[rooster crows]

34:08.465 --> 34:11.217
You know the guys who’s making
a turururu with a snake?

34:12.677 --> 34:15.096
[vocalizing]

34:15.138 --> 34:17.349
It’s our last meal here.

34:17.390 --> 34:18.683
Right?

34:26.024 --> 34:28.234
The chef special
is omelette anyway.

34:28.276 --> 34:29.569
By the bar.

34:29.611 --> 34:31.321
Thank you.

34:43.958 --> 34:45.543
Come, chef.
No break.

34:45.585 --> 34:47.629
I ain’t took
one break all season.

34:47.671 --> 34:48.713
Oh.

34:52.384 --> 34:54.386
It’s just prima donna stuff.

34:54.427 --> 34:55.428
We see this all the time.

34:55.470 --> 34:57.931
My last boat, every evening,

34:57.972 --> 34:59.182
this guy would
come in the gallery

34:59.224 --> 35:00.684
and he’d be like,
can I have raspberries?

35:00.725 --> 35:02.060
There was raspberries
all over the sheet.

35:02.102 --> 35:03.853
I don’t know if it was fetish,

35:03.895 --> 35:06.356
if they were bumping and
grinding with the raspberries,

35:06.398 --> 35:07.732
because it was everywhere.

35:07.774 --> 35:09.359
That and coconut oil.

35:11.695 --> 35:12.946
Put up her ass, clearly.

35:12.987 --> 35:14.906
[laughing]

35:16.491 --> 35:17.826
Mm mm mm.

35:17.867 --> 35:19.327
Lara, Lara, Max, Max.

35:19.369 --> 35:20.704
Can you guys head up to the bow?

35:20.745 --> 35:25.583
And we’re just going to
pull in the passarelle.

35:25.625 --> 35:27.168
-Prepare everything?
-Prepare everything.

35:27.210 --> 35:29.546
Free the lines, start taking
it on the anchor.

35:29.587 --> 35:32.215
Okay, copy.

35:32.257 --> 35:33.925
All lines are free.

35:36.261 --> 35:38.304
Here we go.

35:38.346 --> 35:39.764
Luka, Luka, talk to me.

35:39.806 --> 35:42.684
We’ve got to go another
15 meters starboard side.

35:42.726 --> 35:46.354
You have some small boats coming
down your starboard side.

35:46.396 --> 35:48.440
Seven meters on your port side.

35:48.481 --> 35:50.442
Portofino is like
playing Frogger.

35:50.483 --> 35:51.735
Boat’s coming port side.

35:51.776 --> 35:53.611
There’s boats
coming starboard side.

35:53.653 --> 35:55.572
What the [bleep] is going on?

35:55.613 --> 35:57.907
Dude, these people
are so ruthless.

35:57.949 --> 35:59.784
Nine meters on your port side.

35:59.826 --> 36:00.952
Like yelling about us.

36:00.994 --> 36:02.746
You know how New York taxis
used to be?

36:02.787 --> 36:04.247
That’s Portofino.

36:04.289 --> 36:05.749
It can be a huge distraction,

36:05.790 --> 36:09.252
but for me, all I see
is navigation.

36:09.294 --> 36:12.088
25 meters to the boats
on your starboard side.

36:12.130 --> 36:13.131
Secure the anchor.

36:13.173 --> 36:16.384
-Okay.
-Anchor on.

36:16.426 --> 36:18.094
And your port quarter
is all clear.

36:18.136 --> 36:19.929
-Ciao. Grazie.
-How are you?

36:19.971 --> 36:21.222
-Well done, bro.
-Bravo.

36:21.264 --> 36:22.557
Nice line.

36:22.599 --> 36:24.059
And we’re on the move.

36:26.770 --> 36:29.105
-All right, me love.
-This is Captain Sandy’s.

36:29.147 --> 36:30.190
Perfect.

36:30.231 --> 36:31.274
There is some more stuff
in here, though.

36:31.316 --> 36:32.484
How’s that possible?

36:32.525 --> 36:33.610
-Then what’s this sheet for?
-I...

36:33.651 --> 36:34.986
Okay, I’m hella
confused, girls.

36:35.028 --> 36:36.363
Why?

36:36.404 --> 36:37.864
Because you gave me
this because it’s Sandy’s.

36:37.906 --> 36:39.407
What’s that, then?
Sandy’s was too big.

36:39.449 --> 36:41.076
I handled it in two washes.

36:41.117 --> 36:42.952
No, but I’ve got a fitted sheet.
There’s another fitted sheet.

36:42.994 --> 36:44.454
-No, that wasn’t a sheet.
-Was it a mattress protector?

36:44.496 --> 36:45.497
Yes.

36:45.538 --> 36:46.498
So mattress protector,
right here,

36:46.539 --> 36:49.834
then I can take everything.

36:56.257 --> 36:57.676
No, no, there’s some
more stuff in there.

36:57.717 --> 36:59.135
I know, babe.
Hear me out.

36:59.177 --> 37:00.512
Yeah.

37:00.553 --> 37:02.806
Once the mattress protector
comes out with a towel,

37:02.847 --> 37:04.599
I will take the whole
package up to her.

37:04.641 --> 37:05.975
-Yeah.
-But for now,

37:06.017 --> 37:07.852
if you can finish those cabins,
that’ll be fab.

37:07.894 --> 37:09.813
I would assume the
laundry’s a safer spot

37:09.854 --> 37:11.314
for someone who’s
not really familiar

37:11.356 --> 37:12.691
with such a big boat.

37:12.732 --> 37:14.484
And I’m thinking,
where else can we put Lily?

37:14.526 --> 37:16.861
Is this basically the luggage
compartment at this point?

37:21.783 --> 37:23.118
Coming up...

37:27.997 --> 37:31.334
He wasn’t so brave
without you, but now he is.

37:38.049 --> 37:38.842
Okay, I’m heading to the bow.

37:39.426 --> 37:41.511
Ay, ay, ay, ay.

37:41.553 --> 37:42.721
That’s when I put on extra dry.

37:42.762 --> 37:44.556
That’s when I take out your...

37:44.597 --> 37:46.725
-She forgot a lot of clothes.
-Yeah, she did.

37:46.766 --> 37:49.019
Deck crew,
prepare the anchor.

37:49.060 --> 37:50.020
Copy that.

37:50.061 --> 37:51.229
I think we go in
between those two.

37:51.271 --> 37:52.689
-You got this.
-Okay.

37:52.731 --> 37:56.484
Dropping!

37:56.526 --> 37:58.862
Yeah, 45 meters to the dock.

37:58.903 --> 38:00.572
Lock that one off,
Haley, and throw the others.

38:00.613 --> 38:03.241
That’s all of our
stern lines connected.

38:03.283 --> 38:04.909
Nice work, everybody.

38:05.618 --> 38:07.162
Packing is the worst.

38:07.203 --> 38:08.163
Let me know if you need help.

38:08.204 --> 38:09.748
I need a lot of help.

38:09.789 --> 38:12.083
All crew, let’s meet on the
dock for guest departure.

38:18.298 --> 38:19.924
-Want help down?
-Thank you.

38:19.966 --> 38:23.094
I’m chaining myself to the door.
I’m not going.

38:23.136 --> 38:24.804
Hi!

38:25.847 --> 38:26.681
Thanks.

38:26.723 --> 38:27.932
This whole team is incredible.

38:27.974 --> 38:29.934
We had a beautiful day
with beautiful people.

38:29.976 --> 38:32.437
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you very much.

38:32.479 --> 38:34.189
-It was a pleasure.
-Ciao, Bella.

38:34.230 --> 38:35.398
Ciao.

38:35.440 --> 38:36.608
Well done, everyone.

38:36.649 --> 38:38.735
Out of your whites,
into your reds.

38:38.777 --> 38:43.573
Let’s turn the boat around and
then meet for our tip meeting.

38:43.615 --> 38:45.158
Now we can wear
the red t-shirt, right?

38:45.200 --> 38:46.743
-Yeah.
-Meet on Sundeck.

38:46.785 --> 38:49.204
We’ll just vac dust
the cabins.

38:49.245 --> 38:50.580
White, doing beds.

38:50.622 --> 38:53.416
-Wash and wax.
-Let’s go. You know what I mean?

38:53.458 --> 38:55.001
All crew, all crew.

38:55.043 --> 38:58.338
Let’s meet in the bridge deck
salon for our tip meeting.

38:58.380 --> 39:00.006
The envelope looked
pretty light.

39:00.048 --> 39:02.008
We didn’t do much work
if you think about it.

39:02.050 --> 39:03.009
Speak for yourself.

39:03.051 --> 39:04.344
Thank you, bye.

39:04.386 --> 39:05.887
This guy can’t
----ing help himself, can he?

39:05.929 --> 39:07.639
Something’s going
to go off tonight.

39:07.681 --> 39:10.558
I can just feel it in the air.

39:10.600 --> 39:11.976
We’re more than halfway there.

39:12.018 --> 39:13.687
-How do you do this, Charter?
-It’s fun.

39:13.728 --> 39:17.190
Except for losing
Captain Sunday socks.

39:17.232 --> 39:18.441
You did a great job.

39:18.483 --> 39:20.110
Deck team,
when we docked in Portofino,

39:20.151 --> 39:23.238
one of the most difficult
dockings that we’ve done,

39:23.279 --> 39:24.406
you did an awesome job.

39:24.447 --> 39:25.990
-Thank you.
-You’re on it.

39:26.032 --> 39:26.991
You’re a team.

39:27.033 --> 39:30.662
And this tip is $18,000.

39:30.704 --> 39:34.332
And that is $1252
per person euros.

39:34.374 --> 39:35.458
Thank you, ladies.

39:35.500 --> 39:38.211
Let’s cheers.
Thank you.

39:38.253 --> 39:40.505
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

39:40.547 --> 39:42.507
Don’t spend it all in one place.

39:42.549 --> 39:44.050
I’m going to shower.

39:44.092 --> 39:45.510
We’re going out.

39:45.552 --> 39:47.637
Let’s get this party started.

39:47.679 --> 39:50.015
Got a problem here.
All my clothes is there.

39:50.056 --> 39:51.349
What do you need?

39:51.391 --> 39:54.352
-Do I look like I churn butter?
-No.

39:54.394 --> 39:56.896
[gags]
That’s ----ing strong.

39:56.938 --> 39:57.731
Woo!

39:57.772 --> 39:58.982
Who’s sitting in the back?

39:59.024 --> 40:01.317
Can you put your iPad
back in there, please?

40:01.359 --> 40:02.360
I was just gonna...

40:02.402 --> 40:03.737
Bring the iPad to the club.

40:03.778 --> 40:07.657
I’m putting $100 on Lily
being wasted tonight.

40:07.699 --> 40:10.326
I’m not putting money,
but I will agree on that.

40:10.368 --> 40:12.370
Get out, get out.

40:12.412 --> 40:13.830
[Max vocalizing]

40:15.290 --> 40:16.332
All right.

40:16.374 --> 40:18.543
I’m going to get a margarita.

40:18.585 --> 40:19.961
Can we get two Mexican meals?

40:20.003 --> 40:21.629
Make it three, but with double
tequila for me, please.

40:21.671 --> 40:24.507
-Are you sure?
-Beer? Wine?

40:24.549 --> 40:25.967
Yeah, I’ll have the same.

40:33.933 --> 40:35.268
Bravo.

40:35.310 --> 40:37.520
I think she’s cool.

40:37.562 --> 40:38.563
Has everyone got a drink?

40:38.605 --> 40:39.898
-Cheers.
-Cheers, everyone.

40:39.939 --> 40:41.107
Cheers.

40:48.782 --> 40:51.451
-Mmm.
-It’s good, eh, isn’t it?

40:51.493 --> 40:52.660
Can you do a Liverpool accent?

40:52.702 --> 40:53.787
Can you do
a Liverpool accent?

40:53.828 --> 40:55.580
-No, not Irish.
-No, I can’t.

40:55.622 --> 40:56.831
Nobody can.

40:56.873 --> 40:59.084
-What is that?
-I don’t know. Cheese.

41:18.645 --> 41:21.272
Your banter is above us,
apparently.

41:21.314 --> 41:23.775
So have your banter.

41:23.817 --> 41:25.527
Hey, Lily, is it, is it or not?

41:25.568 --> 41:27.237
They’re playing games. I don’t
know what she’s talking about,

41:27.278 --> 41:28.321
because I see something else.

41:28.363 --> 41:30.365
Wait, what happened?

41:30.407 --> 41:33.451
He wasn’t so brave
without you, but now he is.

41:33.493 --> 41:36.037
Our banter is so sh--.

41:39.165 --> 41:40.291
Oh!

41:40.333 --> 41:41.918
That was a backhander?

41:43.628 --> 41:45.922
Let me go take a wee.

41:49.592 --> 41:51.761
Jack, I know the
game you’re playing.

41:51.803 --> 41:54.347
I feel like Lily’s
already been influenced

41:54.389 --> 41:56.474
by Jack of who I am.

41:56.516 --> 41:57.976
I see it, I hear it,

41:58.018 --> 41:59.978
nothing’s gonna bring
your princess back,

42:00.020 --> 42:02.355
and now you’ve opened
a book of worms.

42:02.397 --> 42:04.190
God damn it.

42:06.860 --> 42:09.237
Later this season on
"Below Deck Med..."

42:09.279 --> 42:10.780
We’re almost there.

42:10.822 --> 42:14.492
We gotta find whatever it is to
keep our attitudes positive.

42:14.534 --> 42:17.662
I’m so ----ing excited.
I am Jacked.

42:17.704 --> 42:20.999
-Woo!
-I thought I was ----ing crazy.

42:21.041 --> 42:22.417
This is chaotic.

42:22.459 --> 42:25.253
They’re out here having
the best time of their life.

42:25.295 --> 42:26.796
Oh!

42:26.838 --> 42:29.716
Where were these guys when I
was getting my teeth extracted?

42:29.758 --> 42:31.551
They would like a
big gay breakfast.

42:31.593 --> 42:33.845
-Oh, stop.
-That’s hilarious.

42:33.887 --> 42:36.639
He’s a problem.
You have to get him...

42:36.681 --> 42:37.682
under control.

42:37.724 --> 42:39.893
Or he’s off the boat.

42:39.934 --> 42:42.687
I think I like Luka
way more than I should.

42:42.729 --> 42:45.065
I like Lily, I really like Lily.

42:47.233 --> 42:48.818
Ow!

42:54.449 --> 42:55.742
Is that your girlfriend
texting you?

42:55.784 --> 42:58.078
Is there something
we don’t know?

42:58.119 --> 42:58.912
No.

42:58.953 --> 43:00.330
We’ve got mutual friends.

43:00.372 --> 43:01.831
Okay.

43:01.873 --> 43:05.126
Look up [bleep] boy and playboy,
and that’s what Luka is.

43:06.461 --> 43:07.420
Lily?

43:07.462 --> 43:08.880
This cannot look like this.

43:10.090 --> 43:12.842
There’s, like, towels
all over the floor.

43:12.884 --> 43:13.927
She is dead weight.

43:13.968 --> 43:16.429
I’ve given her
more than enough.

43:16.471 --> 43:17.972
and she’s just not getting it.

43:18.014 --> 43:21.267
I need you to be more aware.

43:23.019 --> 43:24.187
Where are the deck hands?

43:24.229 --> 43:25.271
I’m here.

43:25.313 --> 43:26.898
Lara’s in the cabin
and Max is down.

43:26.940 --> 43:27.899
We only get you on deck.

43:27.941 --> 43:29.567
That’s not okay.

43:29.609 --> 43:31.027
This is the stuff
that makes me mad.

43:31.069 --> 43:32.237
When she calls and calls,

43:32.278 --> 43:34.072
the deck crew needs
to ----ing answer.

43:34.114 --> 43:35.448
Okay.

43:36.908 --> 43:39.994
My interior team is definitely
hanging on a thread.

43:43.873 --> 43:47.085
I really can’t be handling
men in their 30s.

43:47.127 --> 43:49.921
You’re overstepping boundaries.

43:53.466 --> 43:54.801
Oh, my God.

43:57.178 --> 43:58.930
Sur-----ing-prize!

44:01.182 --> 44:03.935
Jess is definitely trying
to make him jealous.

44:04.811 --> 44:05.895
Sorry, Lil.

44:05.937 --> 44:07.814
He’s a good kisser
I’m just saying.
