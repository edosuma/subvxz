00:13.816 --> 00:15.822
This is abusive.

00:15.857 --> 00:17.507
Making me leave New York?

00:17.542 --> 00:20.009
I'm gonna call my parents and
tell them I'm being abused.

00:20.009 --> 00:22.004
I promise you'll be happy.

00:22.039 --> 00:23.999
It's the best firm in Boston.

00:27.084 --> 00:29.312
Just write down your phone number.

00:33.942 --> 00:35.391
I don't like it.

00:35.517 --> 00:37.586
Well, well, well, well, well.

00:37.621 --> 00:39.538
If you're a client, I'll get you off.

00:39.538 --> 00:41.421
If you're not, the offer's still good.

00:41.421 --> 00:43.581
Okay, ick and double ick.

00:43.616 --> 00:45.321
We're the new guys.

00:45.356 --> 00:46.164
Oh, please.

00:46.165 --> 00:48.972
If there were new guys, they'd have
shown up in the season premiere.

00:48.972 --> 00:50.281
He's smoking, for God's sake.

00:50.281 --> 00:52.435
It's a personal gift from Bill Clinton.

00:52.435 --> 00:55.089
If you only knew where
this cigar has been.

00:55.124 --> 00:58.285
Okay, he's officially
the grossest person I've ever met.

00:58.285 --> 01:00.928
See that sign that says
“Crane, Poole & Schmidt”?

01:00.928 --> 01:05.162
Crane. Welcome to “Boston Legal”.

01:05.516 --> 01:09.673
Jeffrey, the gross man
is fondling me.

01:09.708 --> 01:13.317
It's the official firm greeting.

01:13.352 --> 01:14.976
Cue the music.

01:45.326 --> 01:47.485
And on an incredibly exciting note,

01:47.520 --> 01:49.838
the firm welcomes today
to its litigation department

01:49.838 --> 01:51.819
two of our attorneys
from the New York office.

01:51.819 --> 01:56.059
The first, Jeffrey Coho, who will
be joining us as a new partner.

01:58.098 --> 01:59.702
Did she just say “partner”?

01:59.702 --> 02:03.428
And as a new associate and
former supreme court clerk,

02:03.463 --> 02:05.229
I might add Claire Simms.

02:05.264 --> 02:08.295
Yeah, don't anybody try
and make friends with me.

02:08.330 --> 02:11.329
Excuse me. Did you say
this man is a partner?

02:11.364 --> 02:13.748
She did. I could be your partner.

02:13.783 --> 02:15.255
By the way, you are?

02:15.290 --> 02:16.132
Drop dead.

02:16.133 --> 02:18.956
Excuse me. I realize
you're new to this office,

02:18.991 --> 02:23.963
but we have a zero-tolerance policy here
when it comes to sexual harassment.

02:23.998 --> 02:26.854
Tubby over there groped me
when I came off the elevator.

02:26.854 --> 02:28.441
Did he grunt as he groped?

02:28.476 --> 02:32.027
Because I've found
as long as he's not grunting,
you're perfectly fine.

02:32.027 --> 02:33.849
Okay, I'll be writing that comment up.

02:33.849 --> 02:37.084
Who do we complain to here,
the old people?

02:37.119 --> 02:38.650
Sorry to intrude,

02:38.685 --> 02:41.644
but there's a man here who says
he could be implicated in a murder,

02:41.644 --> 02:42.921
needs to speak to a lawyer.

02:42.921 --> 02:44.138
Claire!

02:46.435 --> 02:48.377
How did he get dibs on that?

02:48.412 --> 02:50.985
Have you not seen the news?
It's on every channel.

02:50.985 --> 02:51.890
We're new in town.

02:51.890 --> 02:54.033
Judge Marcia Hooper was
found murdered last night,

02:54.033 --> 02:56.107
bludgeoned to death in her home
around 10 o'clock.

02:56.107 --> 02:57.405
What does it have to do with you?

02:57.405 --> 02:58.478
First, I work for her.

02:58.478 --> 03:00.653
Second, I was there at 9 o'clock.

03:00.688 --> 03:01.389
In the house?

03:01.389 --> 03:04.238
In the house, in the bedroom,
with the judge.

03:04.239 --> 03:05.837
We were having an affair.

03:05.872 --> 03:07.582
Nobody knows this,
at least as far as I know.

03:07.582 --> 03:11.033
Now the question becomes, do I go to
the police? Do I tell them I was there?

03:11.033 --> 03:13.413
I'll be a person of interest in perpetuity
if they don't solve it.

03:13.413 --> 03:15.296
All right, can you stop with the pacing?
You're bugging me.

03:15.296 --> 03:17.572
A woman is dead.
I may be implicated in her murder.

03:17.572 --> 03:20.331
Fine. Tick if you want, just don't pace.

03:21.233 --> 03:23.090
The question is, do I go forward or not?

03:23.090 --> 03:25.254
If you were in the house,
the police will likely find out.

03:25.254 --> 03:26.312
This isn't boulder.

03:26.312 --> 03:28.674
Well, I was routinely there.
I was her clerk.

03:28.674 --> 03:30.926
I would drop off cases, documents
at all hours.

03:30.926 --> 03:33.144
My being there
isn't necessarily suspicious.

03:33.144 --> 03:34.501
Your semen being there is.

03:34.501 --> 03:36.230
Well, I wore a condom,
which I flushed.

03:36.230 --> 03:38.268
–There may be no evidence of my semen.
–Ick, ick, ick, ick.

03:38.268 --> 03:40.253
Okay, listen to me, Scott.

03:40.288 --> 03:45.047
How we go forward depends on you
truthfully answering the next question.

03:45.082 --> 03:45.952
Okay.

03:45.987 --> 03:47.399
Did you kill her?

03:47.400 --> 03:48.080
No.

03:48.115 --> 03:50.332
Did you have anything
to do with her death?

03:50.332 --> 03:50.934
No.

03:50.969 --> 03:52.711
Then we go to the police.

03:54.279 --> 03:58.848
In which case, my life is over,
at least my career is.

03:58.883 --> 04:00.768
I'm a lawyer on the come.
Any future I may have…

04:00.768 --> 04:02.176
Ick, ick!

04:02.931 --> 04:04.286
I think he did it.

04:04.321 --> 04:07.489
I don't defend murderers, Jeffrey,
especially the icky ones.

04:07.489 --> 04:10.404
You realize this is exactly the conclusion
the whole town will come to

04:10.404 --> 04:12.397
if it gets out that
I was sleeping with the victim.

04:12.397 --> 04:15.167
Okay, if this is about your
reputation, hire a publicist.

04:15.167 --> 04:17.740
If, however, you want to save your ass,

04:17.774 --> 04:19.494
you'll do what I tell you.

04:19.529 --> 04:22.365
And in this case I'm telling you,
if you're innocent,

04:22.365 --> 04:24.737
you go to the police.

04:32.626 --> 04:34.261
Do you think she's cute?

04:34.296 --> 04:35.503
I do.

04:35.538 --> 04:39.801
Is there a reason we're looking
at her picture?

04:39.836 --> 04:41.255
We met on Facespace.

04:41.290 --> 04:43.836
We've been corresponding
for the last two weeks,

04:43.836 --> 04:45.820
and today is our first real date.

04:45.855 --> 04:49.325
She's special, Alan.
She's a lawyer and loves fishing.

04:49.360 --> 04:52.796
She believes in God, guns,
blowing up North Korea.

04:52.831 --> 04:54.765
She could be the seventh one.

04:54.800 --> 04:57.511
Denny, she looks young.

04:57.546 --> 05:01.775
Does she know that you're not?

05:01.970 --> 05:05.390
Alan, um, Shirley sent over a client,

05:05.425 --> 05:08.275
a woman who was fired
for taking maternity.

05:08.310 --> 05:12.096
Ugh, why do I get all the issue cases?

05:12.552 --> 05:16.322
I'd better be getting justice
here, tell you that.

05:17.460 --> 05:18.803
Why are you staring?

05:18.838 --> 05:20.518
I know why you're staring.

05:20.553 --> 05:22.198
You're staring at my knockers.

05:22.198 --> 05:24.685
I know when a man is staring
at my knockers.

05:24.685 --> 05:26.751
This here is part of the problem.

05:26.786 --> 05:31.110
They don't let me take maternity.
They stare at my knockers.

05:31.145 --> 05:32.548
Know what I'm saying?

05:32.583 --> 05:33.953
No way to treat a woman.

05:33.953 --> 05:36.450
I need to file me a civil action.

05:44.270 --> 05:45.435
Hey, new guy.

05:45.470 --> 05:46.349
Brad Chase.

05:46.384 --> 05:47.229
Attaboy!

05:47.230 --> 05:48.549
Look, I can see you're good-looking.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.462
I'm sure all the women at your old firm
wanted to sleep with you,

05:50.462 --> 05:52.883
but here's the deal.
At this firm, I'm that guy.

05:52.883 --> 05:55.269
Oh, I can see that.
Even I want to sleep with you.

05:55.269 --> 05:56.743
Uh, what are you, gay?

05:56.778 --> 05:58.385
No, no. I'm completely straight,

05:58.385 --> 06:02.726
which goes to show
just how attractive you are, Brad.

06:03.527 --> 06:06.853
Jeffrey, what did I say about
not coming on too strongly?

06:06.853 --> 06:08.192
I thought you meant just with you.

06:08.192 --> 06:09.340
You gotta go easy, Jeffrey.

06:09.340 --> 06:11.996
You can't just charge in here
like a bull and try to take over.

06:11.996 --> 06:13.330
–I need a body.
–I'm sorry?

06:13.330 --> 06:15.844
Claire, she doesn't do murder cases.
She finds them “icky,”

06:15.844 --> 06:17.702
so I might need someone
who does them.

06:17.702 --> 06:19.525
Look, look. See, this is you taking over.

06:19.525 --> 06:21.266
Shirley, you brought me in for a reason.

06:21.266 --> 06:25.219
Now was it the other reason, where
my being a bull was a good thing?

06:25.219 --> 06:27.564
That, that was a one-time occurrence.

06:27.599 --> 06:28.967
You didn't say “mistake”.

06:28.967 --> 06:30.267
That will never be repeated.

06:30.267 --> 06:32.435
Shirley…

06:33.558 --> 06:35.822
Okay, you can have your body.

06:35.857 --> 06:38.625
But it won't be mine.

06:41.090 --> 06:42.216
Drop-dead, how's it going?

06:42.216 --> 06:45.931
Shirley, I'd like to know why another
partner's been brought into litigation.

06:45.931 --> 06:47.201
Marlene left.

06:47.236 --> 06:48.679
Well, what about me?

06:48.714 --> 06:50.088
Are you leaving?

06:50.123 --> 06:53.149
I want to know when
I'm going to be made partner.

06:53.184 --> 06:55.511
When you're good enough.

06:57.226 --> 07:00.137
I had trouble conceiving.
Know what I'm saying?

07:00.172 --> 07:02.955
It's tough while you're working and all.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.887
So you're married?

07:04.922 --> 07:07.816
No, I went the route of the sperm donor.

07:07.851 --> 07:10.675
Anyway, I finally thought,
why not adopt?

07:10.710 --> 07:13.775
go overseas, get me one of
those Chinese babies?

07:13.810 --> 07:15.458
You know, like Angelina Jolie.

07:15.458 --> 07:17.056
She did it. Why not me?

07:17.091 --> 07:18.620
So I started the process,

07:18.655 --> 07:21.537
got me a pamphlet, filled out the forms,

07:21.572 --> 07:25.824
told my employer I planned to take maternity
leave for one of those Chinese babies,

07:25.824 --> 07:29.614
and that's when he gave me
the steel toe.

07:29.649 --> 07:32.341
That ain't legal, is it?

07:33.541 --> 07:34.383
Is it?

07:34.418 --> 07:35.226
I'm sorry.

07:35.227 --> 07:39.121
I'm still getting over you being lumped
into a category with Angelina Jolie.

07:39.121 --> 07:43.374
Adoptive mothers qualify for
maternity leave under the law.

07:43.409 --> 07:45.905
–I read it.
–Yes.

07:46.753 --> 07:49.881
Let me have a conversation
with your employer.

07:49.916 --> 07:53.010
You should also know,
he came onto me once.

07:53.045 --> 07:55.657
He wanted some of this here.

07:57.275 --> 07:58.235
Is that a guy?

07:58.270 --> 08:01.150
–Don't be silly.
–Seriously, I think it's a guy.

08:04.112 --> 08:06.008
You had sex with her about what time?

08:06.008 --> 08:08.490
It was around 8 o'clock.
I dropped some pleadings off.

08:08.490 --> 08:09.958
Where was her husband?

08:09.993 --> 08:11.426
Uh, he was out to dinner.

08:11.426 --> 08:13.806
How long had this affair been going on?

08:13.841 --> 08:14.942
About three months.

08:14.942 --> 08:16.183
Were you in love with her?

08:16.183 --> 08:19.109
No, it was just, uh, a physical thing.

08:19.144 --> 08:22.036
You two had any recent disagreements?

08:22.071 --> 08:24.551
Small point. Mr Little here is a witness.

08:24.586 --> 08:27.067
You questions seem to suggest
he's a suspect.

08:27.067 --> 08:28.227
Maybe it's just me.

08:28.262 --> 08:30.941
You might try asking, “were there
any cars parked in the street,”

08:30.941 --> 08:32.784
“any strange people in the area?”

08:32.784 --> 08:35.712
You know, any information that might
shed some light on who killed her.

08:35.712 --> 08:37.315
You do want to know, right?

08:37.315 --> 08:39.230
You want to let me do my job?

08:39.265 --> 08:41.145
He's hoping you'll do it.

08:42.005 --> 08:45.731
What? You want to ask me out?

08:45.912 --> 08:47.020
I'm curious.

08:47.055 --> 08:49.260
Why'd you go to a lawyer
before you came to us?

08:49.260 --> 08:51.396
Well, I was afraid
you'd consider me a suspect.

08:51.396 --> 08:53.782
I reassured him the police
never arrest innocent people.

08:53.782 --> 08:57.727
It just doesn't happen. I'm sure you
in particular are never wrong.

08:57.727 --> 08:59.922
Well, I thought you came
down here to cooperate.

08:59.922 --> 09:00.914
You killed the moment.

09:00.914 --> 09:02.237
I can officially detain him.

09:02.237 --> 09:05.335
In which case he officially asks for
his lawyer, and you can't talk to him.

09:05.335 --> 09:07.978
What is this, good cop/bad cop?

09:08.013 --> 09:10.621
If so, send in the good cop.

09:12.254 --> 09:15.287
That's quite a look.

09:21.965 --> 09:24.375
Do you realize
what murder case this is?

09:24.410 --> 09:26.759
Judge Marcia Hooper.
I watch the news, Paul.

09:26.759 --> 09:29.927
Our name will be front and center.
Is this Jeffrey Coho that good?

09:29.927 --> 09:31.310
He's that good.

09:31.345 --> 09:35.286
Denise, consider yourself on the
homicide case you felt left out of.

09:35.286 --> 09:37.848
Report to Jeffrey Coho.
He needs a body.

09:37.883 --> 09:41.516
Shirley, as lovely as the
new case you sent me is,

09:41.551 --> 09:45.321
and she is delightful, I just had
Jerry Espenson last week.

09:45.356 --> 09:46.995
I need a break from this sort of thing.

09:46.995 --> 09:49.192
I'll get the new girl to help.
She knows employment law.

09:49.192 --> 09:52.421
You can't just assign me
cases and girls.

09:52.456 --> 09:54.117
Girls, maybe.

09:54.152 --> 09:55.450
Claire, excellent.

09:55.485 --> 09:58.199
You'll be working on the
maternity case with Alan Shore.

09:58.199 --> 09:59.928
Thank you.

10:03.642 --> 10:04.584
Hello.

10:04.619 --> 10:05.956
I know who you are.

10:05.957 --> 10:08.128
You're a little horny toad.

10:08.163 --> 10:10.300
Horny toads give me warts.

10:10.335 --> 10:12.841
Hop away, horny toad.

10:25.984 --> 10:27.334
Hello?

10:30.563 --> 10:31.484
Who you?

10:31.519 --> 10:32.856
Jeffrey Coho.

10:32.857 --> 10:35.265
Wow, I love a man who loves his work.

10:35.300 --> 10:37.774
Just a couple of questions, and
I'll be right out of your hair.

10:37.774 --> 10:40.389
I see you have TOD as 10:15.

10:40.424 --> 10:43.249
That a precise time?
Any margin of error on that?

10:43.249 --> 10:44.641
Who hell you?

10:44.676 --> 10:46.033
Jeffrey Coho.

10:46.034 --> 10:48.978
But back to the time. 10:15
give or take how many minutes?

10:48.978 --> 10:50.709
You district attorney office?

10:50.709 --> 10:52.407
I can see you're not
a fan of verbs.

10:52.407 --> 10:53.800
Yes, I am an attorney.

10:53.835 --> 10:56.009
Really, I'll get right out
of your private business,

10:56.009 --> 10:58.004
let you jump headfirst
right back into hers.

10:58.004 --> 11:02.804
And not that it's an issue, but is there any
evidence that the sex was nonconsensual?

11:02.804 --> 11:05.907
I don't mean what's
going on here, of course.

11:05.942 --> 11:07.717
Who hell you?

11:07.752 --> 11:09.457
Jeffrey Coho.

11:09.492 --> 11:11.726
Is it you're a verb bigot?

11:11.761 --> 11:12.981
Call security.

11:13.016 --> 11:15.433
Which would be my cue.
Thank you.

11:21.024 --> 11:23.538
I thought you were gonna file
my civil action.

11:23.538 --> 11:27.990
I am, but I thought we should first meet
with an employment law specialist

11:28.025 --> 11:31.221
so as to get all our ducks in a row.

11:31.256 --> 11:35.635
Ah, Claire Simms,
this is Clarice Bell, our client.

11:35.670 --> 11:39.894
Clarice, this is Claire Simms.

11:41.771 --> 11:45.189
My God, he's like a total transvestite.

11:45.224 --> 11:48.764
Are you kidding me?
It's a big black man in a frock.

11:48.799 --> 11:52.270
This is Dolce & Gabbana,
you pissy little bitch.

11:52.305 --> 11:56.297
You cannot expect me to make a mockery
out of maternity leave law with Barry Bonds.

11:56.297 --> 11:57.743
I have a reputation.

11:57.778 --> 11:59.155
–So do I.
–I'll bet.

11:59.190 --> 12:01.501
And the shoes are Prada, ho.

12:01.536 --> 12:05.206
Okay, the cross-dresser
just called me a ho.

12:05.241 --> 12:07.468
I left around 9. I know I did.

12:07.503 --> 12:09.451
–You're sure?
–Positive, yeah.

12:09.486 --> 12:11.400
–Then where'd you go?
–Home.

12:11.435 --> 12:13.212
Can you verify that?

12:13.247 --> 12:16.842
I guess my mother can.
I live at home.

12:17.038 --> 12:19.564
–Your mother?
–Yes.

12:19.599 --> 12:22.055
Your alibi is your mother?

12:22.090 --> 12:24.226
You say that like
you don't believe me.

12:24.226 --> 12:26.245
Mr Coho, Jonathan Winant is here.

12:26.280 --> 12:30.111
He's an assistant district attorney,
and he seems very upset.

12:30.146 --> 12:31.927
Stay here.

12:35.943 --> 12:37.195
Can I help you?

12:37.230 --> 12:38.412
You Jeffrey Coho?

12:38.447 --> 12:40.052
I am. And I hear you're Jonathan Winant.

12:40.052 --> 12:42.931
Yes, I'm with the Suffolk county
district attorney's office.

12:42.931 --> 12:44.235
I pulled the judge Hooper homicide,

12:44.235 --> 12:46.387
so naturally,
I'm monitoring the investigation.

12:46.387 --> 12:49.782
It's been brought to my attention that you paid
a visit to the coroner's office this morning.

12:49.782 --> 12:51.784
You're standing a little close.
That's okay.

12:51.784 --> 12:53.430
I'm a personable guy myself.

12:53.430 --> 12:56.530
As a matter of fact, I like to talk to people
directly and not just read their reports.

12:56.530 --> 12:58.833
That's why I went to see
the coroner. Chatty little fella.

12:58.833 --> 13:00.329
Okay, that's a little too close now.

13:00.329 --> 13:01.755
–Here's the deal.
–I love deals.

13:01.755 --> 13:04.437
If you ever approach one
of my investigators again,

13:04.437 --> 13:07.084
I will have you arrested
for obstruction of justice.

13:07.084 --> 13:09.756
I will personally get your ticket pulled.

13:09.791 --> 13:13.382
Do I make myself clear?

13:13.576 --> 13:14.974
You do.

13:15.009 --> 13:18.424
And if you think
I've broken a law, arrest me.

13:18.459 --> 13:20.223
I insist on it. You're staring.

13:20.223 --> 13:21.890
Is that 'cause you can't think
of anything to say,

13:21.890 --> 13:23.487
or 'cause detective Richmond
told you that works?

13:23.487 --> 13:26.239
You know, when my mind goes blank,
I just like to go with my old standby,

13:26.239 --> 13:28.900
which is, of course,
“go screw yourself. ”

13:28.935 --> 13:31.695
“Do I need to include
instructions with that?”

13:32.966 --> 13:35.358
Everybody gives me the look.

14:25.368 --> 14:26.842
Denny?

14:27.043 --> 14:29.979
It's me, Bethany, Bethany Horowitz.

14:30.014 --> 14:32.881
It's such a pleasure to meet you.

14:32.916 --> 14:36.934
I'm so nervous. We're actually
meeting in person.

14:36.969 --> 14:38.673
Wow.

14:46.754 --> 14:51.146
<i>She was just the most giving person,
a marvelous judge and an ideal neighbor.</i>

14:51.146 --> 14:53.386
<i>Why, it's absolutely
heartbreaking what happened.</i>

14:53.386 --> 14:55.282
<i>I know I'll certainly
remember her fondly,</i>

14:55.282 --> 14:57.125
<i>as I'm sure others will, too.</i>

14:57.125 --> 14:59.171
<i>The neighborhood won't be
the same without her.</i>

14:59.171 --> 15:01.571
<i>It's tragic what happened, really, tragic.</i>

15:01.571 --> 15:03.371
All right, that guy is creepy.

15:03.372 --> 15:05.308
<i>That was the next-door
neighbor Lincoln Meyer.</i>

15:05.308 --> 15:09.814
<i>Now let's hear what the husband
judge Brian Hooper had to say.</i>

15:09.849 --> 15:13.671
<i>I'd like to express my appreciation
to the authorities handling this case.</i>

15:13.671 --> 15:16.478
<i>This is obviously a difficult time.</i>

15:16.513 --> 15:19.286
<i>My wife was an extraordinary woman.</i>

15:19.321 --> 15:24.645
<i>I pray that police can bring
her vicious killer to justice.</i>

15:24.680 --> 15:29.118
So how can such a little bald man like that
end up with such a beautiful wife?

15:29.118 --> 15:32.099
Drop-dead, we got the client's
mother coming in at 2.

15:32.099 --> 15:34.004
–Can you be there?
–Sure.

15:34.039 --> 15:36.707
My actual name is Denise,
by the way.

15:36.742 --> 15:37.735
I'm sure it is.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.695
Hey, new guy, I take it you were
mocking me there before.

15:40.695 --> 15:41.864
That doesn't fly with me.

15:41.864 --> 15:44.799
When it comes to mockery, ridicule,
sarcasm, there's a no-fly zone of 50 feet.

15:44.799 --> 15:45.513
You need to know that.

15:45.513 --> 15:49.083
Otherwise things become fractious, contentious,
unctuous, no way to start a relationship.

15:49.083 --> 15:49.829
Are we clear on that?

15:49.829 --> 15:51.406
Let me respond in speed
if not kind.

15:51.406 --> 15:53.660
It was never my intent to be
fractious or contentious.

15:53.660 --> 15:55.833
I think unctuous seemed
a little misused there.

15:55.833 --> 15:56.890
But I think I got it.

15:56.890 --> 15:59.421
Keep my mockery, ridicule and
sarcasm at least 50 feet away,

15:59.421 --> 16:01.438
and remember at all times that
girls here want to sleep with you,

16:01.438 --> 16:03.667
because you're that guy.

16:04.942 --> 16:07.547
Okay, that was a mockery.

16:09.194 --> 16:12.134
Look, it wasn't so much
about the maternity leave

16:12.141 --> 16:16.251
as, well, enough was enough.

16:16.286 --> 16:17.804
Enough what, Mr Faber?

16:17.839 --> 16:20.796
There were a multitude of issues.

16:20.797 --> 16:27.642
First, Clarice is quite a comedian.
She's an enormous…

16:27.677 --> 16:29.401
distraction.

16:29.436 --> 16:31.091
What else?

16:31.126 --> 16:34.126
She runs amok of our
sexual harassment laws.

16:34.161 --> 16:35.055
Keep going.

16:35.090 --> 16:39.303
Many of my women employees object
to her using the women's bathroom.

16:39.338 --> 16:40.882
We're getting closer.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.426
She's not a woman, okay?

16:42.427 --> 16:46.454
What are your official grounds
for the discharge, Mr Faber?

16:46.489 --> 16:48.637
The complaint's all drafted.

16:48.672 --> 16:52.556
I just need to plug in
the actionable buzzwords.

16:55.683 --> 16:59.447
I suppose if there was
some disorder in play,

16:59.482 --> 17:05.574
under the country's recently articulated
and accepted 1% risk doctrine—

17:05.608 --> 17:08.159
No, if there is even 1% chance—

17:08.194 --> 17:14.012
that he might harm others
with his psychological deficit…

17:14.048 --> 17:15.642
Ding, ding, ding, ding.
We have a winner.

17:15.642 --> 17:16.987
We just need to add more zeros.

17:16.987 --> 17:20.688
Wait, look. If, if you could
just get him, uh, her,

17:20.723 --> 17:26.012
not to use the women's bathroom and
cut down on the stand-up comedy,

17:26.048 --> 17:28.035
I'd take her back.

17:34.104 --> 17:35.713
Growing up such a battler,

17:35.748 --> 17:38.279
that's probably the reason
I became a lawyer.

17:38.279 --> 17:39.506
You know, it's funny.

17:39.506 --> 17:41.144
When I was going to law school,

17:41.144 --> 17:45.965
I used to daydream that one day I'd be
going up against the great Denny Crane,

17:46.000 --> 17:48.315
and here I am on a date with you.

17:48.350 --> 17:50.321
My mother would flip.

17:50.356 --> 17:52.757
So would my grandmother.
She's a big fan.

17:52.757 --> 17:55.837
And maybe my great-grandmother, too.

17:58.582 --> 18:00.957
Denny, I've been here 20 minutes,

18:00.992 --> 18:03.589
and I'm pretty much
doing all the talking.

18:03.624 --> 18:07.118
Are you normally this quiet?

18:07.153 --> 18:10.613
Bethany, this isn't working out.

18:10.648 --> 18:14.002
–What?
–At some point in a relationship,

18:14.037 --> 18:17.357
you either take the next step,
or you don't.

18:17.392 --> 18:20.515
We just got our salads.

18:20.550 --> 18:22.781
Uh, I have to be honest with you.

18:22.816 --> 18:26.724
You never indicated to me
that you were…

18:27.818 --> 18:30.136
Jewish.

18:30.171 --> 18:31.832
And that's a problem?

18:31.867 --> 18:35.269
Not if I date you, but what if
we wanted to get married,

18:35.304 --> 18:38.087
and we decided to have
midgets of our own?

18:38.122 --> 18:39.649
Children!

18:39.684 --> 18:41.822
I'd want to bring them up Christian.

18:41.822 --> 18:44.332
Did you just say “midgets”?

18:44.367 --> 18:46.149
No!

18:46.610 --> 18:47.842
Did I?

18:47.877 --> 18:51.220
See, that's another thing.
Mad cow.

18:51.255 --> 18:52.139
It's not kosher.

18:52.139 --> 18:54.100
You have a problem
with me being a dwarf.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.803
Oh, God, no! Oh, no.

18:56.838 --> 18:58.934
I love dwarves.

18:58.969 --> 19:02.178
I actually was hoping you'd be one.

19:08.580 --> 19:10.367
So you've already spoken to the police?

19:10.367 --> 19:11.396
I have.

19:11.431 --> 19:13.185
I've told them everything I've told you.

19:13.185 --> 19:16.482
And you're absolutely sure your son didn't
leave the house after he arrived home?

19:16.482 --> 19:17.393
Positive.

19:17.428 --> 19:20.702
And he came home after 9:30.

19:20.737 --> 19:23.151
I said, “around 9:30.”

19:23.186 --> 19:25.286
Are you trying to trap me, Mr Coho?

19:25.312 --> 19:26.332
No, no, no, no.

19:26.367 --> 19:29.667
Maybe I wasn't listening
as well as I should have been.

19:32.065 --> 19:34.367
Could my son actually be arrested?

19:34.402 --> 19:37.851
It's never good to leave one's
semen at the murder scene.

19:37.886 --> 19:42.111
Making love to a woman and killing her
are two very different things.

19:42.146 --> 19:44.482
Mrs. Little, if you've been watching the news,

19:44.482 --> 19:46.784
then you can appreciate the heat on this thing.

19:46.784 --> 19:49.268
The police will be making an arrest.

19:49.303 --> 19:53.218
If they can't catch the real killer,
then your son is going to have to do.

19:53.218 --> 19:55.854
Assuming of course,
he's not the real killer.

19:55.854 --> 19:58.775
–He's not.
–Are you?

19:59.004 --> 20:02.676
Sorry, that question just leapt
into my head. I don't know why.

20:02.676 --> 20:06.663
If you feel you can't
exonerate my son, Mr Coho,

20:06.698 --> 20:09.377
I invite you to point your finger at me.

20:09.412 --> 20:12.215
If an innocent person
needs to go to prison,

20:12.250 --> 20:14.751
better me than him.

20:25.639 --> 20:28.049
The city smells funny.

20:28.084 --> 20:29.188
Boston?

20:29.223 --> 20:32.360
Yes, it has a funny smell.

20:32.395 --> 20:34.569
Or maybe it's that stupid cigar.

20:34.604 --> 20:37.258
–Hey!
–What? You shouldn't smoke.

20:40.344 --> 20:43.461
So, um, who's gonna tell her
to use the men's room?

20:43.496 --> 20:48.548
Given your roaring sensitivity
today, I thought I would.

20:52.782 --> 20:55.257
–Is it my hat?
–More than likely.

20:55.292 --> 20:57.733
How is that cigar working for you?

20:57.768 --> 21:00.359
Well, I've had better. Here.

21:13.488 --> 21:15.388
Hello.

21:16.337 --> 21:19.081
We're looking for Clarice.
Is she here?

21:19.116 --> 21:21.056
No.

21:21.688 --> 21:24.984
I'm Alan Shore,
Clarice's lawyer.

21:25.019 --> 21:26.253
Yeah, uh…

21:26.288 --> 21:30.252
Clarice went to the market.

21:34.362 --> 21:36.868
And you would be?

21:37.495 --> 21:39.445
Her brother.

21:39.647 --> 21:41.280
Her brother.

21:41.315 --> 21:43.518
I'm sure you have a name.

21:43.553 --> 21:44.596
Clarence.

21:44.631 --> 21:46.465
How interesting.

21:46.466 --> 21:49.251
You know, that sounds
a lot like “Clarice,”

21:49.286 --> 21:52.403
so maybe if you should
ever see Clarice,

21:52.438 --> 21:55.520
you could give her
a message from us.

21:57.916 --> 22:00.060
Could you please have her
call us, Clarence?

22:00.060 --> 22:02.354
We have news about her case.

22:02.628 --> 22:03.862
Yeah.

22:17.815 --> 22:19.075
Want to go for a drive?

22:19.075 --> 22:20.742
–A drive where?
–Brookline.

22:20.777 --> 22:22.576
Remember that sniveling friend
of judge Hooper,

22:22.576 --> 22:25.130
the one who gave the gut-wrenching
testimonial on television?

22:25.130 --> 22:30.260
Well, it turns out Marcia Hooper got a
restraining order against him six months ago.

22:30.295 --> 22:33.630
I was thinking “children”. I was gonna
say “children,” and it just came out…

22:33.630 --> 22:36.147
–“Midgets”.
–Oh, I feel terrible.

22:36.182 --> 22:38.629
I mean, she's a human being, Alan,

22:38.664 --> 22:40.968
and God, I hope she doesn't
put a hex on me.

22:40.968 --> 22:42.947
Can they do that, midgets?

22:42.982 --> 22:44.891
What was she like otherwise?

22:44.926 --> 22:48.662
An attractive head and nice breasts,
and that was pretty much it.

22:48.662 --> 22:49.963
Breasts and a head.

22:49.998 --> 22:52.038
–How did you leave it?
–I just left.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.775
I didn't know what else to do.
I just walked out.

22:53.775 --> 22:57.375
Do you think it's possible
she could have followed you here?

22:57.389 --> 22:59.685
Well, I don't think so. Why?

22:59.720 --> 23:01.460
Well…

23:06.002 --> 23:08.409
I didn't want to leave
things on a bad note,

23:08.409 --> 23:11.916
so I wrote you a little note.
–Oh?

23:11.951 --> 23:15.389
Actually, it's a summons and complaint.

23:15.424 --> 23:18.912
See, when you called me a “midget”
in a crowded restaurant,

23:18.912 --> 23:21.112
you caused me emotional distress.

23:21.147 --> 23:23.436
You know, it's really not a good thing

23:23.471 --> 23:28.409
for a named partner in a
big firm to be a dwarf bigot.

23:28.444 --> 23:32.167
I'd hate to drag your disgraceful
behavior into a public forum,

23:32.167 --> 23:34.570
but I do that sort of thing.

23:34.605 --> 23:36.698
The next time you go on “Larry King,”

23:36.698 --> 23:42.230
you're gonna have to explain to the
whole world why you hate dwarfs.

23:49.288 --> 23:52.112
This is worse than a hex.

23:57.952 --> 24:00.315
You know why she got a
restraining order against you?

24:00.315 --> 24:02.348
Oh, that was the husband's idea.

24:02.383 --> 24:05.720
I think he felt a bit threatened
by, well, you know.

24:05.755 --> 24:06.959
What?

24:06.994 --> 24:09.610
The infatuation.
She was drawn to me.

24:09.645 --> 24:12.227
It was never consummated, of course.

24:12.262 --> 24:14.750
I'm deeply Christian.

24:14.948 --> 24:17.695
Judge Hooper was infatuated with you?

24:17.730 --> 24:20.355
It's not something I feel
comfortable talking about.

24:20.355 --> 24:23.178
I understand that in addition
to the media, you went to the police.

24:23.178 --> 24:24.272
Oh, yes.

24:24.307 --> 24:27.596
I was the one who told them
about the boy.

24:27.631 --> 24:29.704
–The boy?
–That boy, Scott Little.

24:29.739 --> 24:32.061
She was biblical with him,
I'll tell you that.

24:32.061 --> 24:35.210
I saw them together
many times doing it.

24:35.245 --> 24:38.359
How did you happen
to see them doing it?

24:38.394 --> 24:39.877
Through the window.

24:39.912 --> 24:41.778
I'm a peepy.

24:41.813 --> 24:43.596
You're a peeping Tom.

24:43.631 --> 24:46.178
It's not something I feel
comfortable talking about.

24:46.178 --> 24:48.415
It was the pretext for the restraining order,

24:48.415 --> 24:50.976
but the real reason was her infatuation.

24:51.011 --> 24:54.113
I think she rather liked me watching.

24:54.148 --> 24:57.215
Women sometimes like having a peepy.

24:58.232 --> 25:00.845
<i>Objection. Move to strike. Objection.</i>

25:00.845 --> 25:03.168
Jeffrey Coho.

25:03.203 --> 25:05.457
What? When?

25:05.492 --> 25:07.134
All right, calm down.

25:07.411 --> 25:08.806
What?

25:08.841 --> 25:11.003
Yeah, all right. I'll meet you at
the back entrance of the courthouse.

25:11.003 --> 25:12.814
You know where Suffolk is?

25:12.849 --> 25:14.906
Yes, yes.

25:15.092 --> 25:16.573
I'm on my way.

25:16.828 --> 25:19.019
–What's going on?
–The police just arrested Scott Little.

25:19.019 --> 25:20.122
What?

25:20.157 --> 25:22.662
<i>The details are very sketchy
at this point.</i>

25:22.662 --> 25:24.537
<i>You're watching live coverage.</i>

25:24.537 --> 25:29.889
<i>What we can tell you is that Scott Little,
a law clerk for judge Marcia Hooper,</i>

25:29.924 --> 25:34.469
<i>was in fact arrested and is set to be
arraigned as early as this morning.</i>

25:34.469 --> 25:36.159
<i>Let me tell you something, folks.</i>

25:36.159 --> 25:37.868
<i>They wouldn't be
hauling him away in cuffs</i>

25:37.868 --> 25:39.255
<i>if they didn't have
the goods on him.</i>

25:39.255 --> 25:41.734
My brother said you had
news about the case.

25:41.734 --> 25:43.816
By “news,” I hope you mean “money”.

25:43.816 --> 25:45.828
Clarice, we have wonderful news.

25:45.863 --> 25:49.855
Your boss, Mr Faber, has decided
not to terminate your employment after all.

25:49.855 --> 25:50.945
What's the catch?

25:50.980 --> 25:53.795
Sexual favors?
Wants a little of this here?

25:53.830 --> 25:54.948
Who wouldn't?

25:54.983 --> 25:56.732
But he didn't mention that, actually.

25:56.732 --> 26:01.696
He would insist, however, that
you stop using the ladies' room.

26:02.657 --> 26:03.942
Meaning what?

26:03.977 --> 26:08.389
Meaning you have testicles, Clarice.

26:09.537 --> 26:11.513
What?

26:16.593 --> 26:18.107
For the sake of efficiency,

26:18.107 --> 26:21.200
let me impart this information
to both Clarice and Clarence,

26:21.200 --> 26:24.607
who you may remember we had
the pleasure of meeting last evening.

26:24.607 --> 26:28.634
The truth is, men's rooms
can be quite exciting, actually.

26:28.669 --> 26:30.541
You might like them.

26:30.576 --> 26:32.379
They got no bidits.

26:32.414 --> 26:34.648
–I beg your pardon?
–Bidits.

26:34.683 --> 26:37.443
Men's rooms don't got them.
I like my hygiene.

26:37.472 --> 26:41.150
My God. He means <i>bidet</i>.

26:48.336 --> 26:52.008
Mr Faber's not saying you can't
work there as Clarice,

26:52.043 --> 26:55.681
he just needs you to stay
out of the girls' bathroom.

26:59.171 --> 27:02.952
Tell him, “thanks, but no thanks”.

27:03.813 --> 27:07.482
I'm going to look for other employment.

27:11.631 --> 27:15.608
Well, I can see you're
not great with people.

27:22.394 --> 27:26.111
Why did they do it
like that, the arrest?

27:26.146 --> 27:29.514
Well, my guess is they're choosing
the court of public opinion.

27:29.514 --> 27:31.988
I can respond in kind. Don't worry.

27:32.023 --> 27:34.371
I can be very loud.

27:34.659 --> 27:37.633
There's something you need
to know about my son.

27:37.668 --> 27:42.048
He does not have the constitution
to survive in prison.

27:42.083 --> 27:44.149
You need to get bail.

27:44.184 --> 27:46.169
I'll do my best,

27:46.204 --> 27:49.220
but if they charge first degree…

27:49.423 --> 27:50.940
You ready?

27:52.490 --> 27:54.220
I promise you all a statement,

27:54.220 --> 27:57.221
but it would be impossible for me
to do justice to the injustice

27:57.221 --> 28:01.004
of this ridiculous arrest
in a 10-second sound bite.

28:01.039 --> 28:02.900
Excuse me. Excuse me.

28:06.256 --> 28:07.753
I appreciate you being here.

28:07.753 --> 28:10.784
I encourage all of you to be
unflinching in your reporting

28:10.784 --> 28:13.162
to better your chances
to root out the truth,

28:13.162 --> 28:15.844
which is contrary to almost
everything printed in this fiction

28:15.844 --> 28:18.912
passing as a criminal complaint.

28:19.087 --> 28:21.298
Whose idea was that little show
this morning, detective?

28:21.298 --> 28:22.245
Get out of my face.

28:22.245 --> 28:24.444
Oh, I'm in your face.
I'm gonna be up your ass.

28:24.444 --> 28:27.804
You bump into me again,
and I'll arrest you for assault!

28:28.002 --> 28:29.197
All rise!

28:29.232 --> 28:31.535
What in God's name is going on here?

28:31.570 --> 28:36.040
I will direct the media
to stop taking pictures now.

28:36.292 --> 28:39.346
Mr Coho, I have a real prejudice
against circus acts.

28:39.346 --> 28:40.773
You already missed
the first one, your honor.

28:40.773 --> 28:42.886
Unless, of course, you happened
to be watching television,

28:42.886 --> 28:44.929
where you would have seen
a spectacularly staged arrest,

28:44.929 --> 28:47.429
proving it's never too early
to start tainting that jury pool.

28:47.429 --> 28:52.131
The public got to see our heroic police
swoop in on the apparent bad guy

28:52.166 --> 28:54.130
and perp-walk him right
in front of the cameras.

28:54.130 --> 28:57.721
Mr Coho, we haven't even brought
the defendant in yet.

28:57.756 --> 29:00.002
Call the case, please,
and bring him in now.

29:00.002 --> 29:02.605
Case number 62313.

29:02.640 --> 29:05.234
Commonwealth of Massachusetts
vs Scott Little

29:05.234 --> 29:07.793
on the charge of murder in the first degree.

29:07.793 --> 29:09.574
Hey! I said no cameras!

29:09.609 --> 29:13.443
The next click I hear,
someone is going into a jail cell.

29:13.478 --> 29:16.898
I will have no compunction
about incarcerating the media.

29:17.209 --> 29:19.499
We'll waive reading of the rest
of the charges, your honor.

29:19.499 --> 29:20.921
We enter a plea of not guilty.

29:20.921 --> 29:24.466
I would point out to the court that
my client has no prior criminal history,

29:24.466 --> 29:26.541
and I would ask that he be freed
on his own recognizance.

29:26.541 --> 29:28.701
–Opposed.
–Bail is posted at $1 million dollars.

29:28.701 --> 29:31.584
I would also ask the court for an
immediate probable cause hearing.

29:31.584 --> 29:32.850
10 o'clock Tuesday.

29:32.885 --> 29:37.651
Now I would like to issue a stern warning
to everybody, the lawyers, the press.

29:37.686 --> 29:42.902
We will conduct ourselves properly
inside and outside this room.

29:42.937 --> 29:46.278
Mr Winant, I don't know who was behind
this morning's grandstanding arrest,

29:46.278 --> 29:48.584
but it has left a foul stench.

29:48.619 --> 29:51.634
Mr Coho, the legend
of your mouth precedes you.

29:51.669 --> 29:55.151
–My mouth?
–This case will be decided on evidence, not antics.

29:55.151 --> 29:58.807
–My mouth?
–And finally, the media…

29:59.532 --> 30:01.962
I won't tolerate any of your hoopla.

30:01.997 --> 30:04.393
This isn't fodder for you to sell copy.

30:04.428 --> 30:06.263
A woman is dead.

30:06.298 --> 30:10.096
A man is on trial.
His freedom is at stake.

30:10.131 --> 30:13.894
You will all conduct yourselves accordingly.

30:13.929 --> 30:17.469
The defendant goes back into custody,
and we are adjourned.

30:18.797 --> 30:20.400
Don't talk to anyone.

30:22.515 --> 30:25.335
I hope you have cause, or you're
looking at obstruction of justice.

30:25.335 --> 30:27.649
Just shut up. Would you please?

30:27.684 --> 30:28.644
What's this?

30:28.679 --> 30:31.570
New discovery for your eyes only.
Then we'll talk.

30:31.570 --> 30:34.462
Until then, I'd hold off
on the big speeches.

30:37.046 --> 30:38.753
What's that?

30:40.270 --> 30:42.044
I don't think it's good.

30:51.155 --> 30:54.771
I really appreciate you
coming back to see me.

30:54.806 --> 30:57.237
–Now take off the wig.
–What?

30:57.272 --> 31:00.517
Look, I know crazy people
like the back of my hand.

31:00.552 --> 31:02.617
I don't think you're schizophrenic,

31:02.617 --> 31:04.577
nor is this any gender disorder.

31:04.612 --> 31:09.496
My bet is that you choose
to assume this Clarice persona

31:09.531 --> 31:13.523
because you are a very shy man
who likes to hide behind a disguise.

31:13.523 --> 31:15.034
Admit that I'm right.

31:15.069 --> 31:18.952
Admit I was right when
I called you a ho, ho.

31:19.325 --> 31:21.945
Does Clarice take you over, Clarence?

31:21.980 --> 31:25.803
Or do you choose to be Clarice?

31:26.681 --> 31:30.968
Please, take off the wig.

31:41.068 --> 31:43.540
Look at me, Clarence.

31:45.657 --> 31:47.208
Look at me.

31:47.243 --> 31:51.837
You have created this false personality
where you feel more comfortable.

31:51.872 --> 31:55.570
Here's a flash.
We all do it, everybody.

31:55.605 --> 31:59.221
Everybody has multiple versions
of themselves.

31:59.256 --> 32:02.838
Now the distinctions are not quite this radical,

32:02.873 --> 32:05.788
but they are differences just the same,

32:05.823 --> 32:13.238
and I think part of your problem is
that you are so successful as Clarice

32:13.273 --> 32:16.583
that it's not as fun being Clarence.

32:16.618 --> 32:18.691
It's not that simple.

32:18.726 --> 32:24.692
Sometimes I actually think things as Clarice
that I could never come up with as Clarence.

32:24.727 --> 32:26.813
I'm funnier as her.

32:26.848 --> 32:29.090
My brain…

32:29.531 --> 32:31.671
I think I'm even smarter as her.

32:31.706 --> 32:34.620
Well, self-confidence can affect
your brain chemistry.

32:34.620 --> 32:38.582
I mean, look, some of the most
brilliant writers in the world

32:38.617 --> 32:41.131
are the most boring people on the earth,

32:41.166 --> 32:44.489
but through their characters…

32:45.616 --> 32:51.397
you are living through this
wonderful character you've created.

32:51.728 --> 32:56.829
Just let Clarence live.

32:59.085 --> 33:03.394
You are taking me to the movies
tonight as Clarence.

33:03.429 --> 33:05.628
Platonic. Don't get any ideas.

33:05.663 --> 33:09.655
It just so happens that I need
some Boston friends myself,

33:09.690 --> 33:11.721
so I will pick you up at 7 o'clock.

33:11.721 --> 33:16.087
–I, I don't know. Uh…
–Well, trust me, I know.

33:16.122 --> 33:20.209
7 o'clock. I'll see you then.

33:22.187 --> 33:28.518
Is it okay if, if I leave here
as, as Clarice?

33:28.553 --> 33:31.018
It's fine.

33:31.269 --> 33:35.890
But Clarence better answer
the door when I knock.

33:41.674 --> 33:43.446
What are you looking at?

33:43.481 --> 33:46.393
You peeping at my knockers? Perv!

33:46.428 --> 33:50.590
And you better not be looking at
my ass on the way out neither.

33:56.665 --> 33:58.300
What?

33:58.785 --> 34:01.108
You're fun.

34:10.456 --> 34:12.195
–I want to see it.
–I'm not saying you can't.

34:12.195 --> 34:15.420
–Let's just let us see it first…
–I'm a big girl, Mr Coho.

34:15.420 --> 34:17.701
Let me see that tape.

34:29.364 --> 34:34.588
<i>Sometimes when you get
a dream like that over and over,</i>

34:34.623 --> 34:37.733
<i>you wonder if it's some kind
of message, you know?</i>

34:37.733 --> 34:41.552
<i>A message from who?</i>

34:41.587 --> 34:42.331
<i>I don't know.</i>

34:42.331 --> 34:44.268
He's talking to a therapist.

34:44.270 --> 34:46.670
How did they get this?

34:46.706 --> 34:49.364
<i>Telling you what?</i>

34:50.697 --> 34:53.561
<i>Maybe I should do it.</i>

34:53.783 --> 34:58.919
<i>Do it? You mean kill judge Hooper?</i>

35:03.590 --> 35:06.713
<i>Maybe there's something
wrong with me loving her.</i>

35:06.713 --> 35:08.702
<i>Then why not just stop loving her?</i>

35:08.702 --> 35:10.719
<i>Because I can't.</i>

35:10.754 --> 35:12.736
<i>I don't know.</i>

35:15.551 --> 35:18.508
<i>Maybe he wants me to kill her.</i>

35:19.874 --> 35:22.821
<i>Is that what you want?</i>

35:26.571 --> 35:28.622
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

35:32.669 --> 35:34.462
It is doctor-patient communication.

35:34.462 --> 35:36.220
It's privileged. It's inadmissible.

35:36.220 --> 35:37.827
This disc was given to us.

35:37.862 --> 35:39.529
It is not the fruit of state action.

35:39.529 --> 35:41.754
The courts have never pierced
doctor-patient privilege.

35:41.754 --> 35:43.492
We routinely pierce that privilege

35:43.492 --> 35:46.375
to protect against child abuse
and prevent imminent bodily harm.

35:46.375 --> 35:48.891
But we don't admit the evidence
in a criminal proceeding.

35:48.891 --> 35:51.644
There is a 3-pronged test, counsel.

35:51.679 --> 35:55.101
First, there must be a legitimate need
for the evidence. Here there is.

35:55.101 --> 35:58.062
Second, the evidence must be
relevant and material. It is.

35:58.062 --> 36:01.570
And third, the information cannot be
secured through a less-intrusive source.

36:01.570 --> 36:03.461
The constitution has a time-honored…

36:03.461 --> 36:07.205
Actually, the constitution says nothing
about doctor-patient communication.

36:07.205 --> 36:10.694
And as Mr Winant points out,
this does not involve state action.

36:10.694 --> 36:13.288
No, your remedy here is
a civil one against a doctor

36:13.288 --> 36:15.393
whose conscience got the better of him.

36:15.393 --> 36:17.429
–I'm going to allow the evidence.
–What?

36:17.429 --> 36:19.492
–You cannot be serious!
–I have made my ruling.

36:19.492 --> 36:21.394
If you choose to appeal it,
you may do so.

36:21.394 --> 36:23.666
We are through here. Good day.

36:23.701 --> 36:26.635
Oh, and tell your client,
between now and trial,

36:26.670 --> 36:29.982
not to kill any more judges.

36:40.339 --> 36:43.259
I had the dream of choking her.

36:43.294 --> 36:46.796
That's one of the many things
I discussed in therapy.

36:46.831 --> 36:50.298
That doesn't mean I'd
actually kill her, and I didn't.

36:50.333 --> 36:51.358
Who was “he”?

36:51.393 --> 36:55.849
You said to your therapist you thought
maybe he wanted you to kill her.

36:55.884 --> 36:57.430
God.

36:57.465 --> 37:00.848
I wondered if God was somehow
talking to me in my sleep.

37:00.883 --> 37:03.122
Why would God want you to kill her?

37:03.157 --> 37:06.179
I was raised in a very conservative household.

37:06.214 --> 37:09.202
My mother imposed a strict value system that…

37:09.486 --> 37:13.152
let's just say, I had and still have
enormous guilt over committing adultery.

37:13.152 --> 37:15.388
I would even say I was
tortured by that guilt,

37:15.388 --> 37:17.856
which is another reason I sought therapy.

37:18.698 --> 37:20.360
Why am I here?
I thought I was making bail.

37:20.360 --> 37:21.901
Why am I still in here?

37:21.936 --> 37:24.342
Scott, your mother is working
on arranging bail for you right now,

37:24.342 --> 37:26.880
and we do hope to have you out of here
by the end of the day.

37:26.880 --> 37:29.019
You need to get me out.

37:29.054 --> 37:31.158
You need to get me out!

37:42.780 --> 37:44.543
And don't you look yummy?

37:44.578 --> 37:45.932
Yeah. Hey, look.

37:45.967 --> 37:47.996
Clarence told me
about your date and all,

37:47.996 --> 37:50.059
and I sure appreciate what
you're trying to do for him,

37:50.059 --> 37:52.339
but he got nervous,
and he's not here.

37:52.343 --> 37:54.004
So rain check, okay?

37:54.039 --> 37:55.666
I see. And who are you?

37:55.667 --> 37:58.922
Me? I'm Clevant, that's who.
I'm his brother.

37:58.957 --> 38:00.827
Look, don't be forcing stuff, okay?

38:00.827 --> 38:03.355
When Clarence is ready,
he'll be ready.

38:03.390 --> 38:04.833
Very nice try,

38:04.868 --> 38:08.625
but I think that Clarence is ready.

38:09.315 --> 38:11.772
Now how long has Clevant been around?

38:13.601 --> 38:15.426
I was just trying him out.

38:15.461 --> 38:18.752
Yeah, well, he's staying here.
Three's a crowd.

38:18.787 --> 38:21.353
So you ready, Clarence?

38:22.973 --> 38:25.644
–Ready.
–All right.

38:26.106 --> 38:28.192
Then off we go.

38:43.693 --> 38:47.869
I consider myself a tolerant man.

38:48.116 --> 38:50.325
And these midgets…

38:50.360 --> 38:53.800
the truth is, I like them.
They're sexy.

38:53.835 --> 38:56.051
I've always heard about
those munchkin orgies,

38:56.051 --> 39:01.152
hundreds of them all in a pile
and the idea of jumping in…

39:02.250 --> 39:04.388
Their libidos are out of whack,
you know.

39:04.388 --> 39:07.121
They can go like gerbils.

39:07.973 --> 39:09.412
What?

39:09.447 --> 39:10.852
Nothing.

39:11.178 --> 39:14.998
Just listening to the idle ramblings
of the tolerant man.

39:15.033 --> 39:17.971
And, and this one…
gonna cause me trouble.

39:18.006 --> 39:19.270
I looked her up.

39:19.305 --> 39:22.162
She's a tenacious litigator.

39:22.197 --> 39:25.020
They call her “the badger”.

39:25.055 --> 39:27.925
They're vicious little people.

39:27.960 --> 39:31.323
Another nugget of insight from
the ambassador of tolerance.

39:31.323 --> 39:33.142
Yeah.

39:33.385 --> 39:35.540
This political correctness
is out of control.

39:35.540 --> 39:39.956
You can't racial-profile.
You can't call a midget a midget.

39:39.991 --> 39:41.807
It's all spinning out of control.

39:41.807 --> 39:45.471
Actually, Denny, it's beginning
to spin your way again.

39:45.506 --> 39:49.135
The stigma of racial profiling
has been obliterated.

39:49.170 --> 39:52.693
Snap judgments are all the rage.

39:52.728 --> 39:56.369
The press has already convicted
this kid arrested for the judge's murder.

39:56.369 --> 39:58.474
'Cause he did it.

39:58.797 --> 40:03.399
My client's boss actually cited
the government's 1% risk doctrine

40:03.434 --> 40:05.898
as a reason for firing him.

40:05.933 --> 40:08.873
Transvestites are now a threat
to national security. Did you know that?

40:08.873 --> 40:10.224
Of course they are,

40:10.259 --> 40:12.567
prancing around, wearing disguises.

40:12.602 --> 40:15.882
There could be a Muslim
underneath all that mascara.

40:15.917 --> 40:19.162
And the nuggets of tolerance
just keep on coming.

40:22.126 --> 40:24.956
I like the new girl, Claire.

40:26.885 --> 40:30.551
She called me gross and fat.

40:30.967 --> 40:33.559
I think she's attracted to me.

40:33.970 --> 40:37.030
These are exciting times
at Crane, Poole & Schmidt.

40:37.050 --> 40:42.502
New lawyers, the juiciest
murder case in town, a dead judge.

40:42.537 --> 40:44.125
And to add to it all…

40:44.160 --> 40:46.900
I'm being sued by a killer dwarf.

40:47.986 --> 40:50.009
Exciting days ahead.
