WEBVTT

00:09.910 --> 00:11.810
[jermaine] it's raining
steady, isn't it?

00:11.812 --> 00:14.413
[wes] yeah.
Oh, it's freezing rain.

00:14.415 --> 00:17.316
And our shelter's
not exactly watertight.

00:17.318 --> 00:18.817
[sarah] it's just
a constant struggle.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.286
-[wes] hey, jermaine.
-Mmm?

00:21.388 --> 00:25.357
Let's get one of them
long logs and shove it in here
and start getting it burned.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.026
-[jermaine] the one's
from outside?
-Yeah.

00:27.028 --> 00:29.828
[jermaine] I mean, listen,
I'm soaking wet anyway
so it doesn't matter.

00:30.865 --> 00:34.700
-Oh, my god! Holy [bleep].
-[wes] yeah.

00:34.702 --> 00:38.704
It's impossible
to have watertight
with spruces.

00:38.706 --> 00:42.307
So, what we're doing is,
we're feeding a couple logs
in from outside,

00:42.309 --> 00:44.810
So we can use those
to make our piles real small.

00:44.812 --> 00:48.047
Putting all our stuff under us
to keep it dry.

00:48.049 --> 00:49.615
-[jermaine] there ya go,
buddy.
-There ya go.

00:49.617 --> 00:50.616
Nice, jermaine.

00:51.919 --> 00:53.952
This is unpleasant weather
at best.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.221
Actually, it's a little scary.

00:56.791 --> 00:58.724
[jermaine]

00:58.726 --> 01:03.262
And then, I guess we're
gonna be hunkering down
and just trying to stay alive.

01:03.363 --> 01:05.631
[sarah] that's kinda
where we're at,
we're embracing the suck.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.265
[wes] come on fire.

01:25.586 --> 01:28.554
I did not get a lot of sleep
that was freezing

01:28.622 --> 01:30.322
That was torturous last night.

01:30.958 --> 01:32.224
Just absolutely torturous.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.627
[jake] <i> under the covers</i>
<i> you just shiver.</i>

01:35.629 --> 01:38.864
<i> Kind of out of control</i>
<i> for actually several hours</i>

01:38.933 --> 01:41.033
Until your core temperature
comes up a little bit.

01:41.135 --> 01:45.104
But, kinda getting
used to that as being
the new norm.

01:46.907 --> 01:50.042
I've always said,
when life gives you shivers

01:50.945 --> 01:52.344
You make shiverade.

02:02.022 --> 02:05.958
[joe] I'm going to guess
it's in the low 20s
out right now.

02:06.026 --> 02:09.728
I'm even under the pelts
and it is really, really cold.

02:11.065 --> 02:12.764
I really thought I knew
what cold was.

02:15.703 --> 02:17.436
I was very wrong.
[chuckles softly]

02:18.706 --> 02:19.705
[gabby]

02:21.408 --> 02:22.674
We're literally frozen.

02:22.743 --> 02:25.944
Every part of us is frozen,
our hands, our extremities.

02:26.013 --> 02:28.947
Our skin to the touch,
you know, when you feel that

02:29.550 --> 02:30.449
Wind whip on you.

02:31.218 --> 02:32.083
It's insane.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.525
-[trish] mmm.
-It's still snowing.

02:41.929 --> 02:44.329
Oh, my god! It is ice.

02:45.232 --> 02:47.399
Our drinking straw
is just covered.

02:47.401 --> 02:49.134
[narrator] <i> as the only</i>
<i> team of two,</i>

02:49.236 --> 02:51.503
<i> Trish and jeremy's</i>
<i> unfinished shelter</i>

02:51.505 --> 02:54.740
<i> Has exposed them to montana'</i>
<i> frigid weather.</i>

02:54.841 --> 02:58.010
[jeremy] I'd rather
deal with insects than
freezing cold temperatures.

02:58.012 --> 02:59.111
[trish] you and me both.

03:05.319 --> 03:08.420
It is freezing outside
and there's snow everywhere

03:08.422 --> 03:10.822
And our shelter
doesn't have a door.

03:10.824 --> 03:13.225
So, the angle of the snow
is coming right in.

03:13.227 --> 03:16.662
Oh, you see that snow
coming in? See the snow
hitting my face?

03:17.565 --> 03:18.263
Yeah.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.265
[jeremy]

03:22.236 --> 03:25.137
We're just
fighting getting out 'cause
it's so fricking cold.

03:25.239 --> 03:26.605
It's gonna be miserable.

03:26.607 --> 03:29.308
I'll be like jack nicholson
in <i> the shining,</i>

03:29.310 --> 03:32.811
I'll just be sitting
in the snow with that weird,
creepy, killer grin.

03:33.414 --> 03:34.112
Yeah,

03:34.748 --> 03:36.081
Freezing montana.

03:37.952 --> 03:41.086
I mean, honestly, trish
I don't see it getting
any warmer.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.088
[trish] no, it's not.

03:43.090 --> 03:46.024
-[jeremy] and that fire wood
is dwindling.
-Yeah, I know it.

03:46.026 --> 03:47.826
<i> If we're gonna</i>
<i> improve our situation</i>

03:47.828 --> 03:51.530
<i> We're gonna start</i>
<i> with cutting some trees dow</i>
<i> and closing up this opening</i>

03:51.532 --> 03:54.299
<i> Give ourselves a little bit</i>
<i> of a snow block, wind block</i>

03:54.301 --> 03:57.035
[jeremy] oh,
it's gonna be freezing cold.

03:57.104 --> 03:59.338
[trish] <i> I didn't come out he</i>
<i> to lay here for the week.</i>

03:59.439 --> 04:01.406
<i> So, I'mma do it.</i>

04:01.408 --> 04:04.209
[jeremy] <i> I mean,</i>
<i> I failed in some</i>
<i> of my previous challenges</i>

04:04.211 --> 04:06.411
<i> And I don't wanna fail again</i>

04:06.413 --> 04:08.547
<i> We ain't got no choice</i>
<i> but to get this better.</i>

04:08.649 --> 04:10.816
<i> I'm contemplating</i>
<i> what we got to get done toda</i>

04:10.818 --> 04:12.884
<i> I'm just seeing snow</i>
<i> just coming everywhere.</i>

04:12.886 --> 04:15.821
It's not gonna be fun,
it's gonna be miserable.

04:15.823 --> 04:18.323
<i> And, you gotta</i>
<i> make up your mind to do it.</i>

04:18.325 --> 04:20.325
That's the only way
I think you can
make it out here.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.412
[trish] it's cold,
it's painful.

04:41.348 --> 04:43.115
[jeremy] my damn hands
are going numb.

04:43.117 --> 04:45.550
-That wind is coming out too.
-[trish] sure is.

04:47.021 --> 04:49.521
-[jeremy] are you okay?
-My fingers are frozen.

04:49.523 --> 04:52.658
[jeremy] get what you can,
just head on back.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.626
-[trish] all right.
-Get that fire going.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.098
<i> It's so cold today</i>
<i> that it hurts.</i>

05:00.100 --> 05:03.535
<i> I mean, it's like</i>
<i> in about 15 minutes</i>
<i> fingers numb,</i>

05:03.637 --> 05:06.805
<i> Toes, everything</i>
<i> hurting, hurting.</i>

05:08.409 --> 05:10.809
-I can't feel my feet.
-[trish] I can't
feel anything.

05:12.546 --> 05:13.245
Take it in.

05:15.316 --> 05:16.715
Jesus christ!

05:16.717 --> 05:20.919
My penis is shriveled,
wrinkled, like a short stack
of quarters.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.854
Not even, like,
a dollar's worth.

05:22.956 --> 05:26.058
-Just like a $0.50 worth.
-[trish] it's [bleep] cold.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.327
[jeremy] oh, [bleep].

05:31.699 --> 05:35.100
We decided
to make our door on this side

05:35.102 --> 05:37.302
'cause the wind
has done shifted.

05:37.304 --> 05:40.539
Now the wind's changed,
so the shelter's gotta change.

05:40.607 --> 05:43.942
-Think about that size, trish?
-That's more than enough.

05:48.749 --> 05:52.317
-Does it seem like the wind
stopping some in there, trish?
-Yeah, it sure does.

05:52.319 --> 05:54.519
[jeremy] oh,
that's what we want.

05:54.521 --> 05:57.756
-Can't feel my damn fingers.
-[trish] you're doing amazing.

05:57.825 --> 06:00.292
-Please, keep that fire going.
-[trish] oh, it's going.

06:00.294 --> 06:02.461
Don't worry,
it'll be here for ya.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.731
As a team of two
somebody has to do the fire.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.201
<i> And somebody has to do</i>
<i> the outside work.</i>

06:10.637 --> 06:13.505
It's, like, it feels like
such a, like, useless job.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.607
-[jeremy] it's not
in these temps.
-Oh, I know it.

06:17.344 --> 06:21.313
-[jeremy] I feel
so much better about this now.
-You did a good job.

06:21.315 --> 06:23.315
-A lot of that wind is gone.
-[trish] yeah.

06:24.118 --> 06:25.317
[jeremy] we did a good job.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.320
-But, I can't feel nothing.
-No.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.257
But, you know what?

06:32.325 --> 06:34.159
-What?
-I forgot about being hungry.

06:49.910 --> 06:53.545
-[waz] it's blowing my mind
how cold it is in here.
-[jake] yeah.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.847
-[waz] it shouldn't
be like this.
-[jake] no, I don't know.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.349
[sara] how are
your feet feeling?

06:57.451 --> 07:00.452
[jake] don't see
any of the puss
coming out anymore.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.854
<i> My feet are holding up</i>
<i> like a bag of garbage.</i>

07:02.956 --> 07:06.224
They are in constant pain.

07:06.226 --> 07:10.228
<i> But, I'm gonna power through</i>
<i> I just need to get food.</i>

07:10.230 --> 07:14.399
[narrator] <i> jake, sara, and w</i>
<i> have struggled to find</i>
<i> any kind of protein,</i>

07:14.401 --> 07:17.903
<i> Despite damming their creek</i>
<i> in a strategy to catch fish</i>

07:17.905 --> 07:21.206
I feel, like, justified
in just how miserable
I was last night

07:21.208 --> 07:23.642
Because I'm seeing
some new ice has formed

07:23.743 --> 07:25.844
On the little dam
that we built.

07:25.913 --> 07:29.214
That's basically, like,
our thermometer 'cause
we don't have one out here.

07:30.350 --> 07:31.616
That and my nipples.

07:32.619 --> 07:35.320
Guys, it's definitely
a much colder start.

07:35.322 --> 07:38.590
-So, might wanna
put on any extra furs.
-Okay, buddy.

07:38.592 --> 07:41.526
I'm gonna head over
across the creek,

07:41.528 --> 07:44.830
-This morning I heard
a few squirrels over that way.
-[waz] oh, yeah.

07:44.832 --> 07:47.632
My plan is,
to get some squirrel.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.267
Ready to seize the day.

07:49.269 --> 07:52.437
It's one of the few things
that we know are right here
by our shelter.

07:52.506 --> 07:54.072
<i> So, my goal is,</i>
<i> just to kind of follow them</i>

07:54.074 --> 07:55.640
<i> Hopefully see one</i>
<i> and take one out.</i>

08:01.915 --> 08:03.148
[waz] <i> even though it's cold</i>
<i> and it's winter,</i>

08:03.250 --> 08:04.682
<i> And there's not a lot</i>
<i> of animals around, like,</i>

08:04.784 --> 08:06.918
<i> I really haven't</i>
<i> seen that much</i>
<i> since I've been here.</i>

08:06.920 --> 08:08.420
There's still stuff
moving around in the water.

08:08.422 --> 08:10.422
And, one of the things
they have a lot of up here,

08:10.424 --> 08:12.691
What you guys call
crawdads or crawfish

08:12.693 --> 08:14.559
Back in australia
we call them yabbies.

08:14.561 --> 08:17.629
<i> I'm just gonna make</i>
<i> a little trap, it's exactly</i>
<i> the same as a fish trap.</i>

08:17.631 --> 08:21.132
<i> But, at the entry</i>
<i> you build a little staircase</i>

08:21.201 --> 08:22.700
So, you just put sticks across

08:24.304 --> 08:26.638
Getting higher and higher
as it gets closer and closer
to the mouth.

08:26.740 --> 08:29.541
So they can crawl up
this little staircase.

08:29.610 --> 08:32.143
And then, into the trap,
try to chase that bait.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.617
[sara] ooh, that wind sucks.

08:38.619 --> 08:41.920
<i> Last night,</i>
<i> was the most miserable nigh</i>
<i> here so far.</i>

08:41.922 --> 08:45.123
We were just
absolutely freezing to death.

08:45.125 --> 08:49.227
So, I saw bunny poop
around here yesterday.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.629
We have not eaten since...

08:51.698 --> 08:52.831
Before insertion.

08:52.833 --> 08:56.401
And, we're losing calories
nightly just by shivering.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.603
See right here?
This is bunny poop.

08:59.306 --> 09:01.406
So, I am in the right place.

09:01.408 --> 09:03.108
So, the rest of the day
I plan to go

09:03.110 --> 09:05.610
And set some traps
to snare some rabbits.

09:05.612 --> 09:07.846
<i> Try not to freeze to death</i>
<i> at the same time.</i>

09:07.915 --> 09:10.348
Hopefully, I have one
in the morning.

09:14.521 --> 09:19.324
<i> So, my grandfather</i>
<i> used to use this trap</i>
<i> all the time.</i>

09:19.326 --> 09:20.525
<i> He was very successful.</i>

09:21.461 --> 09:23.328
Block this off right here.

09:24.431 --> 09:27.599
<i> I'm gonna make</i>
<i> four walls of brush,</i>

09:27.601 --> 09:30.835
<i> And there'll be an opening</i>
<i> in two or three of them.</i>

09:30.937 --> 09:33.538
<i> So, if they want</i>
<i> inside this area</i>

09:33.640 --> 09:35.307
<i> They'll have to go through</i>
<i> one of the snares.</i>

09:36.109 --> 09:37.609
Tied a slipknot.

09:37.611 --> 09:41.046
I'm gonna have
some sticks underneath here
to hold it open

09:41.048 --> 09:42.714
In like an oval pattern.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.616
I have gotta
make it oval because

09:44.618 --> 09:47.619
If it touches their whiskers
they'll back off.

09:48.221 --> 09:49.521
<i> Kinda like a cat.</i>

09:49.523 --> 09:51.923
All right, that's good enough.

09:52.526 --> 09:54.059
Got one over there,

09:54.628 --> 09:55.727
One right there,

09:56.263 --> 09:57.162
And one over here.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.965
Each have a snare line
in them.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.300
Hopefully, I'll catch
some damn rabbits.

10:02.302 --> 10:05.403
My feet are so cold
I wanna cry.

10:11.645 --> 10:12.510
[wes]

10:16.450 --> 10:17.549
[sarah] deceptively cold.

10:17.851 --> 10:18.950
[wes]

10:20.220 --> 10:23.521
At no surprise to anybody,
it's fricking cold.

10:23.523 --> 10:26.424
-[wes] the breeze is ridic.
-[sarah] yep.

10:29.496 --> 10:32.831
-[jason] how are you feeling?
-[sarah] ahh, sorry, I'm not
feeling too great right now.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.200
-[jason] I'm gonna
check your blood pressure.
-All right.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.704
This morning
we had pretty significant
temperature changes.

10:39.706 --> 10:41.406
<i> It was very cold,</i>

10:41.408 --> 10:43.942
<i> So we're checking</i>
<i> on the well-being</i>
<i> of the participants.</i>

10:45.012 --> 10:46.845
Knock-knock, medic's here.

10:46.913 --> 10:48.513
-[ky] hello.
-[jason] how's it going?

10:48.515 --> 10:49.714
[ky] good, how are you?

10:49.783 --> 10:54.152
Gonna do, uh, just a little
baseline vital check, okay.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.621
We are concerned
with heart rates.

10:56.623 --> 11:01.126
[narrator] <i> in extreme cold,</i>
<i> hypothermia is</i>
<i> a constant danger.</i>

11:01.128 --> 11:05.530
<i> As the body fights</i>
<i> to create heat in the core,</i>
<i> blood vessel constrict,</i>

11:05.532 --> 11:07.699
<i> And the heart rate increase</i>

11:07.701 --> 11:10.902
<i> A sustained resting heart ra</i>
<i> over 100</i>

11:10.904 --> 11:13.038
<i> Is considered</i>
<i> potentially dangerous.</i>

11:13.040 --> 11:16.741
[jason] heart rate, 71.
O2 saturation is, 97.

11:16.810 --> 11:17.976
-Is that good?
-It's good.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.076
-Okay.
-Very healthy.

11:19.078 --> 11:21.713
-Ooh.
-I know, it's cold.
Sorry, buddy.

11:21.715 --> 11:23.615
The first three days
were really rough for me.

11:24.151 --> 11:25.883
I won't lie.

11:25.885 --> 11:28.820
[narrator] <i> joe struggled</i>
<i> with dehydration</i>
<i> earlier in the challenge.</i>

11:28.822 --> 11:29.821
[ky] joe!

11:29.823 --> 11:32.357
-[gabby] whoa, can yo hear me?
-Mmm-hmm.

11:33.727 --> 11:36.094
[jason] so,
you're blood pressure
is slightly elevated.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.263
And you're heart rate
is fluctuating.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.932
And, I seen it
go all the way up
to as high as 130.

11:42.102 --> 11:44.602
[narrator] <i> when the pulse</i>
<i> remains elevated overtime</i>

11:44.604 --> 11:47.505
<i> It puts the heart at risk</i>
<i> for tissue damage.</i>

11:47.507 --> 11:48.940
<i> And, even a heart attack.</i>

11:52.846 --> 11:55.714
Um, looking at
your blood pressure,
and you're pulse inside.

11:55.716 --> 11:57.749
-You're blood pressure
is high.
-Mmm-hmm.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.718
And you're pulse is...

11:59.720 --> 12:02.053
-About double
what is should be.
-Oh.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.756
So, the numbers
are concerning.

12:04.858 --> 12:07.258
<i> I'm concerned</i>
<i> about sarah's vital signs.</i>

12:07.360 --> 12:09.060
Essentially her heart
is beating too fast.

12:09.129 --> 12:12.063
<i> And, if that continues,</i>
<i> I have very high concerns</i>

12:12.132 --> 12:14.599
<i> That she may need to be</i>
<i> medically tapped.</i>

12:14.601 --> 12:18.803
All right, so,
we're gonna continue
to monitor the situation.

12:18.805 --> 12:23.608
And, if the situation
doesn't improve, we would
have to pull you. Okay?

12:24.745 --> 12:26.511
-You've got to stay
hydrated today.
-[sarah] yep.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.714
It's your safety on the line.

12:29.716 --> 12:31.316
So, it is a serious situation.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.954
[jason] this could be
from dehydration

12:35.956 --> 12:38.823
We have plenty of ice,
we've got snow around here.

12:38.825 --> 12:41.092
So, I'll be back
to check on ya.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.962
Hydration, hydration,
hydration is key.

12:44.063 --> 12:45.597
[joe] <i> can't seem to keep up</i>
<i> with hydration.</i>

12:45.599 --> 12:46.865
Got a little careless.

12:47.601 --> 12:48.633
And, now I'm paying for it.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.606
[wes] hey, buddy.
It's gonna be all right, okay?

12:54.608 --> 12:58.543
[jason] <i> at the end of the da</i>
<i> when it comes to your heart</i>
<i> it ain't no game.</i>

12:59.412 --> 13:00.612
Uh, it sucks.

13:02.616 --> 13:03.915
Ugh!

13:13.126 --> 13:16.127
-I finally
just got some sleep.
-[trish] yeah, me too.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.196
We did a good job.

13:19.366 --> 13:22.200
I'm gonna go out
and try to get
something to eat.

13:22.202 --> 13:25.170
[trish] I'm gonna
get the fire started
and get some wood.

13:25.172 --> 13:28.540
It's been nine days
since I've had any food
in my belly.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.508
[ducks quacking]

13:32.312 --> 13:36.915
I've never went this long
without eating something.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.950
<i> Through every challenge,</i>
<i> I've eaten by day two.</i>

13:40.554 --> 13:42.420
<i> I've got some</i>
<i> fishing lines out,</i>

13:42.422 --> 13:44.155
<i> Hoping I catch</i>
<i> a trout or something.</i>

13:45.091 --> 13:47.859
Oh! I ain't got nothing.

13:48.929 --> 13:52.363
The wind gust
and blew it up outta
the water.

13:52.432 --> 13:54.499
Every time you come out
and you don't catch nothing,

13:54.501 --> 13:56.734
Or kill anything,
it's just another
disappointment.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.107
[grunting]

14:07.414 --> 14:09.714
[bleep] <i> going.</i>

14:10.750 --> 14:13.117
<i> Pee again</i>
<i> and it's just sharp pains.</i>

14:17.257 --> 14:19.224
Just something else
to deal with out here.

14:25.832 --> 14:27.232
-[trish] hey.
-Hey.

14:27.934 --> 14:29.701
[trish] see anything?

14:29.703 --> 14:32.237
[jeremy] I ain't had nothing
on the fishing line.

14:32.338 --> 14:34.105
[trish] I thank you
for trying.

14:34.107 --> 14:35.907
[jeremy] <i> I had to stop and p</i>
<i> and it was just...</i>

14:35.909 --> 14:38.109
<i> And it was burning some and</i>

14:38.111 --> 14:40.311
It does kind of get a little
bit harder to urinate.

14:40.313 --> 14:43.047
<i> There at my bladder,</i>
<i> you can't hardly touch it.</i>

14:43.049 --> 14:45.216
[bleep]

14:45.218 --> 14:48.052
It's just a sharp,
sharp pain whenever you,

14:48.121 --> 14:50.521
Just the slightest
little push on it.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.357
I wonder if it's from, like,

14:52.458 --> 14:54.359
Being so tense and cold.

14:54.460 --> 14:55.293
Maybe you're keeping it,

14:55.295 --> 14:57.128
Holding it in
so long at night.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.663
-Maybe it's like...
-[jeremy] I don't know.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.265
...Giving you
a bladder infection.

15:00.333 --> 15:03.034
<i> Jeremy, he is</i>
<i> an amazing partner.</i>

15:03.136 --> 15:05.503
Definitely being sick
in this environment

15:05.505 --> 15:07.038
Is not where you want to be.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.940
[groans] I don't feel good.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.743
My bladder. Whatever it is.

15:11.844 --> 15:15.546
[trish] let's try to get
your bladder flushed out.

15:15.615 --> 15:19.617
<i> It is extremely important th</i>
<i> jeremy stays very hydrated</i>

15:19.619 --> 15:23.021
Because I don't think
this challenge would be
possible single-handedly.

15:23.023 --> 15:25.523
If you were alone,
with no partners.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.426
It'd suck to go home
for a bladder infection.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.762
[trish] yeah, it would.

15:39.406 --> 15:41.105
[ky] you doing okay, joseph?

15:41.107 --> 15:42.840
You seem low.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.710
Yeah, overall I feel okay.
Uh...

15:45.712 --> 15:47.412
[gabby] what's going on?

15:47.414 --> 15:50.515
-Hunger pains are really just
kind of what I'm dealing with.
-[gabby] okay.

15:50.517 --> 15:51.849
That's, it's just weird,
I mean, like,

15:51.918 --> 15:53.952
I, physically I can feel
my blood sugar

15:53.954 --> 15:55.853
-Like slowly going each day.
-[gabby] of course.

15:55.922 --> 15:58.323
Joe's had this
elevated heart rate.

15:58.325 --> 15:59.824
The medics
have been concerned.

15:59.826 --> 16:01.025
<i> It's definitely worrisome.</i>

16:03.630 --> 16:04.996
You know, I have been
dreading this,

16:04.998 --> 16:07.065
But I do know
I need to go out.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.701
I mean, I don't mind
taking a little exploration.

16:10.704 --> 16:12.503
-[ky] don't be too risky.
-[gabby] yeah.

16:12.505 --> 16:13.504
[joe] <i> after seeing the medic</i>

16:13.506 --> 16:14.939
<i> That was a bit</i>
<i> of an eye opener.</i>

16:14.941 --> 16:17.442
But, I'm not going to
get careless

16:17.510 --> 16:18.575
To the point where it's like,
you know,

16:18.577 --> 16:20.311
Something like that's
going to take me out.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.046
I'm doing this
for a chance to eat.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.148
-[ky] you're almost
out there, joe.
-[joe sighs] thank you.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.951
<i> Bottom line, I need to be ab</i>
<i> to contribute out here.</i>

16:27.020 --> 16:29.053
<i> Now I can feel like</i>
<i> I at least did my part.</i>

16:29.055 --> 16:31.122
Just help out, look around.

16:31.124 --> 16:33.725
[exhales forcefully]

16:39.366 --> 16:41.199
Oh. [breathing shakily]

16:41.201 --> 16:43.434
Oh, my god. I wish
I had a pair of pants.

16:45.038 --> 16:46.704
Freaking cold.

16:47.807 --> 16:49.874
I don't know if rabbits
are going to be moving

16:49.876 --> 16:53.611
In this kind of weather,
but won't know unless I try.

16:55.448 --> 16:56.948
So what I'm going to do now,

16:56.950 --> 17:02.754
I'm going to slowly walk
across this blind of bushes

17:02.855 --> 17:04.756
To see if I
can't find any rabbits.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.229
No fresh tracks.

17:12.465 --> 17:13.231
[bleep]

17:15.135 --> 17:16.200
[blows air]

17:18.738 --> 17:19.737
A little weak.

17:20.840 --> 17:22.106
I'm really feeling it.

17:23.309 --> 17:25.143
<i> I want to contribute so much</i>

17:25.211 --> 17:27.945
But, I think
I might be burning
myself out a little bit.

17:32.419 --> 17:34.218
-Hey, ky?
-Yeah?

17:34.220 --> 17:37.522
[joe] looks like we got
some weather coming in
from our southeast.

17:37.524 --> 17:40.124
I've been
shoring up the shelter

17:40.126 --> 17:43.294
And chopping up firewood
so I'm feeling confident.

17:43.296 --> 17:44.429
[joe] excellent.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.741
[sarah speaking]

17:58.611 --> 17:59.777
[wes speaking]

17:59.779 --> 18:01.612
-[sarah] yeah.
-[wes] okay?
If you can sit here

18:01.614 --> 18:03.614
And drink a bunch
of water, relax,

18:03.616 --> 18:05.817
And get yourself
back to right,
then everything's fine.

18:05.819 --> 18:07.017
Yeah.

18:07.019 --> 18:09.253
[wes] <i> sarah and I did</i>
xl <i> in africa together.</i>

18:09.355 --> 18:13.424
<i> She's tough but her pulse</i>
<i> is way out of whack.</i>

18:13.426 --> 18:15.159
The plan today
to keep sarah with us

18:15.228 --> 18:17.562
<i> Is that she can't</i>
<i> leave the shelter.</i>

18:17.630 --> 18:20.031
-I'll just work on
that fish basket today.
-[wes] yeah.

18:20.033 --> 18:22.700
Um, get that cranked out.

18:22.702 --> 18:25.036
[wes] yeah, get
that thing done tight.

18:25.105 --> 18:26.237
That'd be great.

18:26.239 --> 18:27.405
-You ready?
-[jermaine] let's go
for a walk.

18:27.407 --> 18:30.341
We really need to bring back
something for sarah.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.943
<i> Just to give her</i>
<i> a little boost.</i>

18:32.011 --> 18:34.745
Something that might help
make her healthy again.

18:41.721 --> 18:44.422
[jermaine] yesh. Definitely
colder on this side.

18:44.424 --> 18:45.656
[wes] yeah, it is colder.

18:46.359 --> 18:47.959
Wow, nice bones.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.427
[jermaine] look at that.

18:49.429 --> 18:50.962
[wes] kill site for sure.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.530
[jermaine] yeah, well it
could be a bison.

18:52.532 --> 18:55.299
[wes] a mountain lion
could have taken
just about anything, right?

18:55.301 --> 18:56.366
[jermaine] yeah.

18:56.368 --> 18:59.137
[wes] something ate very well.
I'm jealous.

19:02.909 --> 19:05.243
[jermaine] oh, dude,
oh my god, mullein.

19:06.446 --> 19:08.246
[wes] I don't know
what that is.

19:08.347 --> 19:11.816
Primarily, if you smoke it,
it's a vasodilator.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.619
Oh, cool.
Put it in the bag, yeah.

19:14.621 --> 19:17.221
[jermaine] when your
blood pressure's up
when you're cold,

19:17.223 --> 19:21.192
Your veins, they all constrict
to try to put all of your

19:21.194 --> 19:23.661
Resource of heat
and blood to your core.

19:23.730 --> 19:27.165
<i> If you smoke this,</i>
<i> as a vasodilator,</i>

19:27.233 --> 19:29.333
It would reduce
her blood pressure

19:29.435 --> 19:31.302
And reduce her pulse,

19:31.304 --> 19:34.138
And, uh, this might be like
a little magic trick.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.675
Home sweet home. Yeah.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.143
[sarah] what's up?

19:39.145 --> 19:41.145
[jermaine] we didn't find
any meat, but I got
something for you.

19:42.081 --> 19:43.514
[sarah] oh, mullein.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.216
-That's freaking perfect.
-[jermaine] yeah.

19:45.218 --> 19:46.951
[sarah] I got to make a pipe.

19:47.053 --> 19:49.820
I'm taking this reed,
I'm going to try this out.

19:49.822 --> 19:51.556
It's got a little carb
on the back here.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.724
A little bowl
for me to smoke from.

19:56.329 --> 19:57.261
Go from there.

19:57.931 --> 19:59.764
<i> It's been</i>
<i> utilized traditionally</i>

19:59.865 --> 20:02.300
<i> In a lot of different</i>
<i> municipal uses.</i>

20:02.302 --> 20:06.003
<i> Indigenous people</i>
<i> have utilized it for literal</i>
<i> thousands of years.</i>

20:06.005 --> 20:08.139
What I'm hoping
that if I smoke some of this,

20:08.241 --> 20:11.209
<i> It might bring</i>
<i> my blood pressure to</i>
<i> a more normal level.</i>

20:14.113 --> 20:16.414
That works. [laughs]

20:16.416 --> 20:19.717
I have made a functional
bushcraft pipe

20:19.719 --> 20:22.520
For smoking mullein.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.622
-[jermaine] how we doing?
-[sarah] good.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.791
The effects of the mullein n
are pretty immediate

20:26.793 --> 20:28.926
Which is honestly,
quite awesome.

20:28.928 --> 20:31.762
I feel like
when I inhale right now,

20:31.864 --> 20:34.131
That I'm getting a deeper,
fuller breath.

20:35.134 --> 20:37.501
That's pretty wild.

20:37.503 --> 20:40.004
Really cool to utilize
plant medicine

20:40.006 --> 20:43.441
In a real life survival
situation in this manner.

20:43.509 --> 20:46.644
And, uh, I'm hoping
that changes up my results

20:46.712 --> 20:49.113
When the medic comes back
to do the old checkup.

20:53.953 --> 20:56.554
[jake] <i> hopefully if I can</i>
<i> get over to that</i>
<i> other side of the creek</i>

20:56.623 --> 21:00.424
<i> And do a little exploring it</i>
<i> kind of uncharted territory</i>

21:00.426 --> 21:04.428
<i> Just see if there's</i>
<i> any resources over there</i>
<i> that we can benefit from.</i>

21:04.430 --> 21:06.564
Everybody's hungry
and everybody wants

21:06.633 --> 21:07.999
Whatever food they can find.

21:08.001 --> 21:09.233
Huh.

21:10.203 --> 21:12.036
We got some fresh tracks.

21:12.105 --> 21:14.805
Looks like quite a few running
up and down this creek.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.707
So I'm gonna just try
to follow that same line.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.743
Do a little hunting
with the slingshot.

21:18.844 --> 21:21.112
And just see
what we can't get.

21:21.114 --> 21:24.015
I gotta eat. I get really
bitchy when I'm hungry.

21:28.354 --> 21:30.955
Right through this area,
it looks like it's a little

21:31.724 --> 21:33.224
Highway of squirl tracks.

21:33.226 --> 21:35.259
It looks like there might be
some that are a little larger.

21:35.328 --> 21:36.794
So I'm gonna scout up
the hillside.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.263
Then I'll also have a little
better vantage point

21:39.332 --> 21:41.332
Of, uh, what's going on
around me.

21:45.605 --> 21:49.540
Oh, [bleep]. That's something
much larger than a squirrel.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.380
Oh, [bleep].

21:58.951 --> 22:03.321
[laughs incredulously]
I just came across something
much larger than a squirrel.

22:03.323 --> 22:05.756
<i> A coyote.</i>

22:05.825 --> 22:09.627
It doesn't seem like
it's been dead that long.

22:09.629 --> 22:11.429
Oh, [bleep] it broke its leg.

22:13.232 --> 22:16.100
You know, he's not marked up
like he was fighting
with another coyote.

22:16.936 --> 22:18.703
God, I don't know.
I don't know.

22:18.705 --> 22:22.506
It looks like there's prints
coming down this steep hill.

22:22.508 --> 22:24.709
And for each pace,
there are three steps

22:24.711 --> 22:26.711
And then one really big drag.

22:26.713 --> 22:30.147
I'm guessing the thing was up
top and got into with a moose

22:30.216 --> 22:32.049
Or something that gave him
a really swift kick

22:32.051 --> 22:34.018
'cause the bone is just
snapped in two.

22:34.020 --> 22:36.654
I mean, it's bittersweet
'cause it's such

22:36.723 --> 22:39.523
A beautiful animal to see it
laying here lifeless,

22:39.525 --> 22:43.561
But for me, you know,
it's, uh, it's kind of
a game changer.

22:44.230 --> 22:45.129
[groans]

22:46.132 --> 22:47.798
<i> I have never</i>
<i> had coyote before.</i>

22:47.800 --> 22:49.100
<i> It's not on my bucket list.</i>

22:49.102 --> 22:54.205
But, [laughs] in this
situation, beggars
can't be choosers.

22:54.207 --> 22:57.908
<i> Yeah, we'll make sure</i>
<i> none of this beautiful anima</i>
<i> goes to waste</i>

22:57.910 --> 23:00.711
And that will really turn
around things for our clan.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.913
-[waz] what?
-Got dinner.

23:02.915 --> 23:05.516
-[waz laughing] what?
-A little better
than a squirrel.

23:05.518 --> 23:07.485
Shut up.

23:07.487 --> 23:10.554
It's definitely a great site
seeing so much food.

23:10.623 --> 23:13.424
I mean, a normal coyote,
you're looking at
30, 40, 50 pounds.

23:13.426 --> 23:15.760
-Yes.
-Looks pretty fresh, huh?

23:15.795 --> 23:17.361
[waz] I'm pretty sure this
meat's going to be good.

23:17.430 --> 23:19.196
I mean, we had
cold temperatures overnight.

23:19.198 --> 23:20.431
Yeah. Yep.

23:20.433 --> 23:22.299
[waz] I mean,
this animal's lost its life

23:22.301 --> 23:23.801
And we don't want to
waste that, you know?

23:23.803 --> 23:25.803
I'm super pumped.
Get some food in our bellies.

23:25.805 --> 23:27.037
Get some energy in us.

23:27.039 --> 23:29.740
It's sad that this poor thing
has lost its life somehow,

23:29.809 --> 23:32.009
<i> But, very happy</i>
<i> for the three of us.</i>

23:32.011 --> 23:34.745
[jake] huge, huge gift
from mother nature.

23:34.847 --> 23:36.814
-[sara] jake, great find.
-[jake] thank you.

23:39.318 --> 23:40.951
[waz] when the wind dies down,
the sun's on us.

23:40.953 --> 23:42.219
[jake] feels great, yeah.

23:42.221 --> 23:43.954
<i> We're going to get</i>
<i> a fire going out here,</i>

23:44.023 --> 23:46.524
Make the most
of this beautiful day.

23:46.526 --> 23:49.560
<i> It's something that</i>
<i> we also have to take</i>
<i> serous precaution with</i>

23:49.662 --> 23:51.962
Because there's a lot of
really hungry animals out here

23:52.064 --> 23:55.332
That would kill for
what we just found.

23:55.434 --> 23:59.804
In my community,
I'm also a bear. Back off.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.305
[waz] <i> when you're</i>
<i> in a place like this,</i>

24:01.440 --> 24:04.308
<i> You have so many</i>
<i> carnivores running around</i>
<i> looking for meals,</i>

24:04.310 --> 24:07.111
<i> As for addressing that,</i>
<i> the stuff we're not using,</i>

24:07.113 --> 24:09.146
<i> We're going to throw it</i>
<i> in the creek and let it</i>
<i> go downstream.</i>

24:09.215 --> 24:11.315
The stuff we are going to use,
we're going to bury

24:11.317 --> 24:12.750
And try and keep it safe
under some rocks.

24:12.785 --> 24:15.719
The thing about this meat
is it all smells good.

24:17.190 --> 24:19.723
<i> Jake's doing a bit</i>
<i> of barbequing down here.</i>

24:19.725 --> 24:20.858
<i> Lunch and dinner right there</i>

24:20.926 --> 24:23.327
Backstrap for lunch,
stew for dinner.

24:23.329 --> 24:25.229
[jake] it's pretty exciting.
It's the first food

24:25.231 --> 24:27.765
-That I've smelled in--
-[waz] oh, look at that.

24:27.833 --> 24:28.799
[jake] ...Quite a while.

24:28.868 --> 24:30.901
[sara] that actually
makes me super excited.

24:30.903 --> 24:32.937
[waz] I mean,
it's definitely going to be
chewy, you know that.

24:32.939 --> 24:34.839
-[jake] yep.
-[waz] I probably
had it in a stew.

24:36.042 --> 24:38.542
This to try.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.281
Mmm-hmm.

24:48.421 --> 24:50.521
It's kind of exactly
what I thought it was
going to taste like.

24:50.523 --> 24:51.222
Me too, yeah.

24:51.224 --> 24:52.890
It's okay.

24:54.026 --> 24:57.328
[jake] <i> it's kind of like</i>
<i> when you get one</i>
<i> of those $1.99 steaks</i>

24:57.330 --> 24:59.630
And you leave it
on the grill for 14 hours.

24:59.632 --> 25:02.600
I mean, it's not,
like, a ribeye,

25:02.602 --> 25:04.602
But I'm happy about it.

25:04.604 --> 25:06.804
It's calories in the body.
That's all I want, you know?

25:06.806 --> 25:08.506
I can't even chew that.

25:08.508 --> 25:09.607
Now, I'm not going to run home

25:09.609 --> 25:12.543
And go out and shoot me one
and cook it up.

25:12.612 --> 25:15.746
But, right now
it's much needed.

25:15.815 --> 25:18.115
Oh, that thing
tastes wretched.

25:18.117 --> 25:19.650
But good.

25:19.752 --> 25:21.051
Bon appetit.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.498
[trish] you doing
all right, buddy?

25:34.500 --> 25:35.499
[jeremy] no.

25:35.501 --> 25:37.902
-Your bladder?
-Yep.

25:37.904 --> 25:40.704
[trish] <i> jeremy's been</i>
<i> dealing with a little pain</i>
<i> in his bladder.</i>

25:40.706 --> 25:44.308
We're so close to
like, getting to 14

25:44.310 --> 25:48.145
That it's terrifying to think
that if it gets worse
he could leave.

25:48.214 --> 25:52.049
I'll probably go take a walk
down the riverside again.

25:52.118 --> 25:54.151
<i> I'm ready to do</i>
<i> whatever it takes.</i>

25:54.220 --> 25:56.253
I want you to get better.

25:56.355 --> 25:58.556
-Well, thank you.
-That way we'll

25:58.624 --> 26:00.524
Be able to finish this
as a team.

26:11.103 --> 26:15.506
<i> It is absolutely horrific</i>
<i> being out in this temperatur</i>

26:15.508 --> 26:18.709
But, uh, I know there's some
things that we need to do.

26:18.711 --> 26:21.445
<i> The beaver trap fell down.</i>

26:21.547 --> 26:24.648
[bleep] got to set it again.

26:27.119 --> 26:29.720
Part of my job
as being on the team

26:29.722 --> 26:32.423
Is to pick up the slack.

26:33.859 --> 26:34.959
I know we need food.

26:34.961 --> 26:36.827
I know there's a lot
of things we need.

26:36.829 --> 26:39.263
And, uh, that's what's
keeping me going.

26:39.332 --> 26:42.800
Just pure drive and willpower.

26:42.802 --> 26:46.604
I feel like I'm kind of
quarantined to
this room right here.

26:46.606 --> 26:49.406
<i> It feels amazing knowing</i>
<i> trish is out there.</i>

26:49.408 --> 26:52.042
And I know she hates that cold
just as much as me,

26:52.144 --> 26:55.112
But, for her doing that, it's,
to me, it means a lot.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.513
It really does.

27:04.890 --> 27:07.024
<i> Well, I want to keep going</i>
<i> and go on further</i>

27:07.026 --> 27:09.560
<i> Just trying to see</i>
<i> what I can find.</i>

27:13.866 --> 27:17.501
I see a little bit
of cattail over here.

27:17.503 --> 27:20.104
The native americans
used to eat them

27:20.106 --> 27:22.306
So I'm going to see
if I can find anything

27:22.308 --> 27:24.608
And dig it up

27:24.610 --> 27:28.345
So that we can roast it
and eat it and get
some kind of starch.

27:28.447 --> 27:30.314
[narrator] <i> cattails have</i>
<i> a fibrous root</i>

27:30.316 --> 27:32.850
<i> Which is rich in</i>
<i> energy-producing starches.</i>

27:32.951 --> 27:36.220
<i> When the root is cooked,</i>
<i> it tastes similar to a potat</i>

27:36.222 --> 27:38.956
<i> And contains</i>
<i> up to 80 calories.</i>

27:39.025 --> 27:41.458
[trish] the ground is frozen.

27:41.527 --> 27:43.861
I don't see how I'm
going to be able to
get down to the root.

27:46.032 --> 27:49.533
Even with the shovel,
it's like, impenetrable.

27:49.635 --> 27:53.137
Everything's frozen solid
under the permafrost.

27:53.238 --> 27:56.040
So it's a pretty
big disappointment.

27:58.344 --> 28:01.211
We need to figure out
how to get to them.

28:01.213 --> 28:02.346
I'm not giving up.

28:09.155 --> 28:11.055
[jeremy] I have
dreamed about food.

28:11.156 --> 28:14.058
And every time I dream about
food, I get pretty hungry.

28:14.060 --> 28:16.627
I have cramps
on top of cramps.

28:16.629 --> 28:17.961
[trish] yeah, me too.

28:19.965 --> 28:22.433
[jake] we have stew.

28:22.501 --> 28:24.501
[sara] I've never
had coyote stew.

28:24.503 --> 28:26.704
This smells
and looks delicious.

28:26.706 --> 28:29.406
-[waz] so I'm going to go in
for a big chunk here.
-[jake] whoa.

28:29.408 --> 28:33.310
It's not chewy. At least
that piece was pretty tender.

28:33.312 --> 28:35.646
[waz] it's way better
than I think what
we had this afternoon.

28:35.715 --> 28:37.247
Well, I like it more anyway.

28:38.417 --> 28:41.952
[wes] ugh.
I haven't eaten jack.

28:42.021 --> 28:44.054
And my brain's not working
real well anymore.

28:44.123 --> 28:46.123
[waz] <i> I can feel</i>
<i> it's got some fat on it.</i>

28:46.125 --> 28:48.058
<i> I feel that it's still moist</i>

28:56.102 --> 28:58.035
[gabby speaking]

28:59.505 --> 29:01.038
We need food.

29:04.009 --> 29:05.542
[sara] mmm.

29:05.611 --> 29:09.513
-[waz farts]
-[jake] whoa. Fuel the flame.

29:09.515 --> 29:10.414
[waz coughs]

29:25.865 --> 29:27.231
[gabby] nice brisk morning.

29:27.233 --> 29:29.299
Maybe this cloud cover
will burn off

29:29.301 --> 29:30.734
And we'll get
a little sunshine.

29:30.836 --> 29:31.768
[grace] yeah?

29:31.770 --> 29:33.604
[gabby] how are
you guys doing today?

29:33.606 --> 29:35.139
-Good, how are you?
-I'm a little chilly.

29:35.240 --> 29:36.907
-A little chilly?
-Ready to get moving.

29:36.909 --> 29:39.710
-Ready to get moving.
We're just gonna, um...
-[joe breathing heavily]

29:39.712 --> 29:42.613
-[grace] ...Take a quick set
of vitals again, joe.
-[joe] oh, boy. All right.

29:42.615 --> 29:44.314
Still drinking
plenty of fluids.

29:44.316 --> 29:45.749
Lots and lots of warm stuff.

29:46.819 --> 29:49.219
[grace] your heart rate's
still pretty elevated.

29:49.221 --> 29:52.022
Have you had any chest pain,
shortness of breath, anything?

29:52.024 --> 29:54.725
Not unless I just, like,
get that cold air hit me.

29:54.727 --> 29:56.693
-And then just...
-That cold air hits you
and then, all right.

29:56.695 --> 29:59.062
Everything almost seizes up.

29:59.131 --> 30:01.698
-[grace] make sure you drink
a lot of water.
-I know.

30:01.700 --> 30:04.301
[grace] <i> if joe's heartrate</i>
<i> stays this elevated,</i>

30:04.303 --> 30:06.203
That would be
a potential for a tap out.

30:06.205 --> 30:08.405
We can't leave somebody out
here with a high heartrate.

30:08.407 --> 30:11.341
-So, we're gonna
keep an eye on it, okay?
-Yeah.

30:11.410 --> 30:13.176
[ky] <i> I'm super</i>
<i> worried about joe.</i>

30:13.178 --> 30:17.648
Joe's heartrate has been
getting more and more elevated
over the last few days.

30:17.716 --> 30:21.218
<i> So, hopefully today</i>
<i> he can get some rest</i>
<i> and plenty of water.</i>

30:21.220 --> 30:23.620
[joe] I've just got to
constantly remind
myself to hydrate.

30:23.622 --> 30:25.255
[ky] that's a good idea.

30:31.664 --> 30:35.098
[wes] just look
for compression tracks
and also movement.

30:35.100 --> 30:37.668
<i> We're really trying to get a</i>
<i> kind of calories we can toda</i>

30:37.670 --> 30:40.504
Sarah is down. She, uh,
had a bad med check.

30:40.506 --> 30:41.939
<i> She can't move around</i>
<i> a whole lot.</i>

30:41.941 --> 30:43.941
<i> She's got to drink</i>
<i> nothing but water all day.</i>

30:44.944 --> 30:46.310
Just watch where
you step around there.

30:46.312 --> 30:48.946
Lots of prickly pear.

30:49.047 --> 30:52.416
[wes] I know there's
a lot of work involved
with it, jermaine, but

30:52.418 --> 30:55.519
Some of these prickly pear
cactus appear pretty sizable.

30:55.521 --> 30:58.088
That might be worth our time.

30:58.090 --> 31:00.123
-[jermaine] yeah.
-Let's collect, you know,

31:00.125 --> 31:02.593
A half-dozen, a dozen
of the biggest ones of those.

31:02.595 --> 31:04.361
-They're not eaten, right?
-[jermaine] yeah.

31:06.298 --> 31:08.031
[wes] <i> you know,</i>
<i> a few days ago, uh,</i>

31:08.033 --> 31:10.934
<i> I had no interest in eating</i>
<i> prickly pear. Zero.</i>

31:10.936 --> 31:13.804
I wanted meat. I wanted
a rabbit. I wanted trout.

31:14.607 --> 31:16.707
<i> Fast forward about four days</i>

31:16.709 --> 31:18.742
I'll take
whatever comes along.

31:18.811 --> 31:21.745
-[jermaine] should we, uh,
go and check on sarah?
-[wes] absolutely.

31:26.318 --> 31:28.318
[trish] how's your
bladder doing?

31:28.320 --> 31:30.387
-[jeremy] I'm feeling
a little better.
-[trish] yeah?

31:30.389 --> 31:34.224
[jeremy] <i> I got a good bit</i>
of rest yesterday. I'm feeling
<i> a little better today.</i>

31:34.226 --> 31:38.095
<i> But I ain't been getting foo</i>
<i> I been getting</i>
<i> lightheaded and dizzy.</i>

31:38.097 --> 31:39.496
Yeah.

31:39.498 --> 31:41.932
[jeremy] <i> 14 days</i>
<i> is approaching,</i>
<i> and I haven't ate.</i>

31:41.934 --> 31:44.801
I've never been this hungry
before in my life.

31:44.803 --> 31:48.605
If we're able to get some
of the cattails [slapping bug]
there'll be a lotta starch.

31:48.607 --> 31:50.807
[jeremy] why don't we just
build a fire over it?

31:50.809 --> 31:53.110
They're all on the ground,
build a bonfire
right there on 'em.

31:53.112 --> 31:54.411
You wanna try it?

31:54.413 --> 31:55.712
Yeah.

31:55.780 --> 31:59.416
Anything is on the menu here.
We have not eaten in ten days.

31:59.418 --> 32:02.119
[jeremy] let's
burn this bitch down.

32:02.121 --> 32:03.787
Defrost the ground.

32:03.789 --> 32:06.623
-[trish] let's bring it.
-[jeremy] and get our cattail.

32:06.625 --> 32:09.459
[trish] it won't be hard
to light that up.

32:17.503 --> 32:18.802
[jeremy]

32:26.412 --> 32:27.844
[trish] how are ya gonna
put that out?

32:27.946 --> 32:30.414
[jeremy] all right. I wanna
try and keep it controlled.

32:32.952 --> 32:36.753
-[jeremy] that one's gonna
stop at the snow.
-[trish] mmm-hmm. Yeah.

32:36.855 --> 32:40.524
[trish] we got a natural
firebreak with the snow.

32:40.526 --> 32:44.361
[jeremy] <i> trish was talking</i>
<i> about the roots of the catta</i>
<i> we can get them and eat 'em</i>

32:44.463 --> 32:47.364
But we can't get to 'em,
because of all the ice.

32:47.433 --> 32:51.401
<i> And I, I thought about</i>
<i> let's just try to burn</i>
the field right through there.

32:51.403 --> 32:54.304
Something to start trying
to melt the ice
and get down into it.

32:56.642 --> 33:00.744
-[jeremy exclaiming] it's
still solid. Look at that.
-[trish] no.

33:03.816 --> 33:08.719
[jeremy] yeah. It's about
four inches deep.
Nothing but ice.

33:08.721 --> 33:10.119
[trish] such a disappointment.

33:11.724 --> 33:15.325
[jeremy grunting]
it's just not meant
for you and I to eat.

33:16.829 --> 33:18.528
[trish] not cool, montana.

33:18.530 --> 33:23.633
[jeremy] there's food
right there.
Unbelievable. God.

33:30.042 --> 33:31.742
[trish] it's a disappointment.

33:31.843 --> 33:34.711
-[jeremy] I don't know
what to do.
-[trish] I don't know, either.

33:34.713 --> 33:38.949
[trish] it's gonna get cold
again tonight, so it'll be
right back where we were.

33:39.051 --> 33:42.552
[jeremy] the only thing
I'm gonna eat out here
is gonna be ice chips.

33:42.654 --> 33:45.222
[jeremy] <i> I think her and I</i>
<i> have both come to conclusion</i>

33:45.224 --> 33:49.526
We're literally gonna be
the first <i> naked and afraid</i>
contestants

33:49.528 --> 33:53.730
To complete a challenge
and not have anything to eat.

34:00.639 --> 34:01.705
[sarah] is that the guys?

34:01.707 --> 34:03.540
-[jermaine] yeah.
-[sarah] what's up?

34:03.642 --> 34:05.809
-[jermaine] we found
some prickly pear.
-[sarah] ohh.

34:05.811 --> 34:08.712
-[jermaine] I'm gonna
start cooking it.
-[wes] that sounds great.

34:09.815 --> 34:11.615
[sarah] you guys
are fantastic.

34:11.617 --> 34:13.817
<i> When jermaine said</i>
<i> that they had prickly pear,</i>

34:13.819 --> 34:17.421
I just felt relief
wash over me, because
I knew I was gonna eat.

34:17.423 --> 34:21.725
Trying to give it a little
sear, just to get it
kinda caramelized,

34:21.727 --> 34:23.960
-[jermaine] and then
we'll add water.
-[sarah] sweet.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.563
[jermaine] <i> me and sarah,</i>
<i> we've had some issues</i>
<i> with each other.</i>

34:26.632 --> 34:29.699
But we are a tight team.
So we're all coming together.

34:29.701 --> 34:32.903
<i> That way, we're prepared</i>
<i> for this med check, and we c</i>
<i> go ahead and push through.</i>

34:32.905 --> 34:34.738
-[sarah] oh, I smell it.
-[jermaine] yeah.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.807
[sarah] smells kinda like,
uh, cucumbers.

34:36.809 --> 34:39.509
<i> Prickly pear itself has bee</i>
<i> utilized in foreign cuisine</i>

34:39.511 --> 34:44.214
All over the world
for a very long time, so
I appreciate them so much.

34:44.216 --> 34:47.050
<i> They're exactly what I want</i>
<i> in a partner out there.</i>

34:47.052 --> 34:48.752
[jermaine] look at that.

34:48.820 --> 34:50.620
[sarah] gonna season it
with some ants?

34:50.622 --> 34:53.757
[jermaine] could do that.
Grab some. Locally harvested.

34:53.825 --> 34:55.725
-[sarah] free range organic?
-[jermaine] yes.

34:55.727 --> 34:57.461
[sarah] I'll just squish 'em
in as I go.

34:59.465 --> 35:02.999
[jermaine] oh, <i> piece</i>
<i> de resistance.</i>
[guffaws in french accent]

35:03.001 --> 35:07.137
The anticipation of flavor
outweighs the hunger
right now, which is weird.

35:13.045 --> 35:15.112
-[sarah] that's good.
-[wes] tastes delightful.

35:15.114 --> 35:16.613
-[jermaine] it's crazy,
isn't it?
-[wes] I love it.

35:16.615 --> 35:17.714
[jermaine] squash, no salt.

35:17.716 --> 35:19.448
It does. It tastes
just like squash.

35:19.518 --> 35:21.418
-[sarah] yeah, it does.
-[jermaine] it's the most
substantial thing we've eaten.

35:21.420 --> 35:26.356
I'm so glad to be chewing.
The prickly pear, you know,
you pop it in your mouth

35:26.391 --> 35:29.025
And you have to actually chew
two or three times.

35:29.027 --> 35:30.594
<i> You actually feel human agai</i>

35:30.596 --> 35:32.462
-[jermaine] hey, sarah.
-[sarah] 'sup?

35:32.531 --> 35:36.099
-[jermaine]
how are you feeling?
-[sarah] feeling fantastic.

35:36.101 --> 35:38.335
-Especially after this.
-That's good news.

35:38.403 --> 35:39.836
Yeah. Yeah, I'm thinking
it's good news.

35:39.905 --> 35:42.305
[sarah] thanks for taking
care of me today, guys.

35:50.215 --> 35:52.516
[wes] <i> sarah's looking bette</i>
<i> this afternoon,</i>

35:52.518 --> 35:54.518
But the next med check
will tell the tale.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.720
Knock, knock.
How you guys doing?

35:56.722 --> 35:57.654
Uh, good.

35:57.756 --> 35:59.389
You guys get some hydration?

35:59.391 --> 36:00.857
-Mmm-hmm.
-Okay.

36:01.827 --> 36:04.060
[wes] <i> if she's better,</i>
<i> she gets to stay.</i>

36:04.062 --> 36:07.998
If she's not, I'm afraid
that she's gonna go, uh, home,

36:08.000 --> 36:10.300
But probably
by way of the hospital.

36:10.302 --> 36:13.103
Okay. Well, let's go ahead
and have you stand up.

36:16.808 --> 36:19.409
[sarah] <i> I feel like</i>
<i> it's very important for me</i>
<i> to stay in this challenge.</i>

36:19.411 --> 36:22.712
<i> I came out here because</i>
<i> I wanted the most extreme.</i>

36:22.714 --> 36:27.117
I want to be here through
to the end, just to say
that I've done it.

36:27.119 --> 36:28.952
[medic] how do you feel
standing up?

36:28.954 --> 36:30.153
[sarah] I feel fine.

36:30.222 --> 36:31.454
[medic] you feel fine? Cool.

36:32.724 --> 36:34.424
Gonna run one more time.

36:39.131 --> 36:42.799
Okay. So... [clears throat]

36:45.037 --> 36:45.936
[jeremy] let's burn this bitch
down.

36:45.938 --> 36:47.204
[trish] how are we gonna
put that out?

36:47.206 --> 36:48.838
-Got dinner.
-What?

36:48.907 --> 36:51.208
[medic] your pulse is double
what it should be.

36:51.210 --> 36:53.510
[joe sighs]

Okay.

So your vitals
look awesome today.

39:09.314 --> 39:10.914
Blood pressure's looking good,

39:10.916 --> 39:13.616
And your hydration's
looking a lot better
than it has been

39:13.618 --> 39:15.552
-So keep that up, okay?
-Good. Thank you.

39:15.653 --> 39:18.555
All right. Definitely gotten
some calories
and some hydration into you

39:18.623 --> 39:21.691
-And it's showing, so...
-Good. That's
what I like to hear.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.359
[sarah] <i> oh, my gosh.</i>

team effort.

-Yeah.
-There you go, now.

<i> And we're on to better days</i>

39:40.812 --> 39:43.413
-[jermaine] a lesson
for all three of us, right?
-[sarah] yeah.

39:43.415 --> 39:46.049
-[wes] drink more damn water.
-[sarah] yeah.

39:49.454 --> 39:51.221
-[ky] ah, sunshine.
-[gabby] I know.

39:51.223 --> 39:52.455
[joe] it's quite nice.

39:54.493 --> 39:56.059
[gabby] joe, how you feeling?
How you doing?

39:56.061 --> 39:58.628
[joe] my lips
are really, really cracked,
which is uncomfortable.

39:58.630 --> 39:59.729
But that's about it.

39:59.798 --> 40:02.532
[ky] well, I'm gonna
pull mine in, extend my line.

40:03.902 --> 40:05.301
Good afternoon.

40:05.303 --> 40:06.603
-[ky] oh, hey!
-[david] hey.

40:06.605 --> 40:09.105
We're gonna take your, uh,
heart rate again, okay?

40:09.107 --> 40:09.839
[joe] okay.

40:09.908 --> 40:11.106
I'll come around to you.

40:11.109 --> 40:13.109
This stresses me out so much
when you come around.

40:13.111 --> 40:14.310
[laughing] I'm sorry.

40:16.381 --> 40:18.415
Joe's had
an elevated heart rate, uh,

40:18.417 --> 40:21.751
That's been sustained
over several days,
even when he's resting.

40:21.853 --> 40:23.853
<i> And that's concerning,</i>
<i> because at resting,</i>

40:23.922 --> 40:25.955
Heart rate should be
between 70 and 80,

40:25.957 --> 40:27.357
And joe's been
well above that.

40:29.661 --> 40:31.127
148.

40:32.998 --> 40:35.031
Unfortunately,
it's been getting worse.

40:35.033 --> 40:37.700
When we've been checking it,
it's been getting worse.

40:37.702 --> 40:40.804
And unfortunately, we just
don't have the capability

40:40.806 --> 40:45.708
To make sure that you're safe
and you're healthy out here.

40:45.710 --> 40:47.343
[david]
with a resting heart rate
that high,

40:47.412 --> 40:49.546
Your heart is not doing
what it's supposed to do,

40:49.647 --> 40:53.716
And you are at risk
of tissue death, tissue
damage, and even heart attack.

40:53.718 --> 40:57.620
And so for that reason,
I have to medically
tap you right now.

40:59.558 --> 41:00.857
[sighs]

41:01.960 --> 41:03.827
[david] and I'm
sorry to do this.

41:05.597 --> 41:07.030
[sighing]

41:07.032 --> 41:08.398
I'm sorry, joe.

41:08.400 --> 41:11.201
We've let you have the time
that we can give you.

41:11.203 --> 41:14.337
But we can't leave
somebody out here
with a high heart rate.

41:14.439 --> 41:18.341
It's just not a risk
we wanna take
in this environment.

41:18.443 --> 41:21.778
There's nothing I can do
at this point? Like, 24 hours,
hydrate, anything?

41:21.780 --> 41:24.514
[david] your heart rate
is so high over,
it's not even close.

41:24.516 --> 41:27.517
If it were close
or borderline, maybe
we could do something.

41:27.519 --> 41:30.253
It's not even borderline.
It's, it's dangerous.

41:30.355 --> 41:32.255
And we can't treat it
out here in the field.

41:32.858 --> 41:34.224
All right.

41:35.660 --> 41:38.194
[sighing] I'm sorry, guys.

41:38.196 --> 41:39.762
-Don't apologize.
-I'm sorry.

41:39.831 --> 41:43.399
You've done so amazingly
out here, and you
found your confidence.

41:43.401 --> 41:45.702
-[gabby] I know how much
this meant to you.
-[ky] yeah.

41:45.704 --> 41:47.704
[joe] I just wanted
to walk out with you guys.

41:47.706 --> 41:50.039
[gabby] you'll be there
in spirit.

41:50.041 --> 41:51.641
[joe] yeah.

41:51.710 --> 41:53.309
<i> I, I'm kind of at a loss</i>
<i> right now.</i>

41:53.311 --> 41:56.312
<i> I am being removed</i>
<i> from the challenge,</i>
<i> due to my heart.</i>

41:56.314 --> 41:59.516
I've always been told
that was my greatest asset.

41:59.518 --> 42:04.254
And, turns out it's one of
my weakest right now.

42:04.355 --> 42:06.055
[joe] just finish together.

42:06.057 --> 42:07.357
-[gabby] we can do that.
-[ky] we will.

42:07.359 --> 42:09.325
[joe] just take care
of each other, okay?

42:09.327 --> 42:11.528
-[gabby] I hope
you get better.
-[joe] okay.

42:11.530 --> 42:13.429
I can't believe I got to spend
the time with you guys.

42:13.431 --> 42:15.031
[ky] yes, me too.

42:15.033 --> 42:17.133
[joe] <i> pretty heartbroken</i>
<i> about it all. But...</i>

42:18.737 --> 42:20.503
...I'm at extreme risk
for a heart attack.

42:21.940 --> 42:23.740
<i> And I've got a family</i>
<i> I've gotta take care of.</i>

42:25.710 --> 42:27.577
<i> I can't ignore that.</i>

42:27.579 --> 42:30.813
God, I just, I just wanted
a few more days.

42:34.853 --> 42:36.319
<i> I left everything out here.</i>

42:37.222 --> 42:39.222
There's nothing more I can do.

42:41.726 --> 42:43.560
Maybe I just pushed myself
too much.

42:50.702 --> 42:54.938
<i> But I will be healthy</i>
<i> in no time, and you</i>
<i> will see me again.</i>

42:55.006 --> 42:56.506
This just wasn't my time.

43:10.422 --> 43:12.322
[gabby sighing] I did not
expect that.

43:12.324 --> 43:14.557
[ky] neither did I.

43:14.626 --> 43:18.161
[gabby] I'm absolutely
shocked. I knew that joe's
heart rate was high,

43:18.229 --> 43:22.098
But I didn't know that he was
at risk of being tapped.

43:22.100 --> 43:26.202
It just goes to show you,
though, that, you know,
we can tap at any time.

43:26.204 --> 43:28.605
[ky] yeah, it just makes you
feel like none of us are safe.

43:28.607 --> 43:31.040
[gabby] <i> this challenge</i>
<i> is no joke.</i>

43:31.042 --> 43:34.110
You just never know
when it's gonna be
your time to go, so...
