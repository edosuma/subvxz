00:01.209 --> 00:04.045
-Previously on Prison Break...
-Company's moving Scylla.

00:04.129 --> 00:05.171
-When?
-Tomorrow.

00:05.422 --> 00:06.423
I messed up.

00:06.506 --> 00:08.842
-What do you mean?
-I mentioned Whistler.

00:10.135 --> 00:12.429
Hello.

00:12.512 --> 00:13.596
Hello?

00:14.305 --> 00:15.515
So you're Feng.

00:17.350 --> 00:18.977
-Susan.
-That's right.

00:19.060 --> 00:21.855
The wall itself is fortified
with steel fiber.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.607
The bad news is that
there are both weight

00:24.691 --> 00:26.151
and microphonic sensors

00:26.234 --> 00:27.777
that will alert
Company security

00:27.861 --> 00:30.155
to the presence
of any breathing human being

00:30.238 --> 00:31.823
that weighs more
than two pounds.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.158
Mike!

00:33.241 --> 00:35.201
You have
a hypothalamus hamartoma,

00:35.452 --> 00:37.287
and the doctor feels
that you need surgery.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.414
-Two days.
-No, tomorrow.

00:39.497 --> 00:41.833
Otherwise, you could die,
and there's no alternative.

01:11.362 --> 01:12.822
Just a little bit more.
Go slow.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.979
♪ ♪

02:08.294 --> 02:10.380
No, there's no way he
deserves any of this.

02:10.797 --> 02:11.881
Sing it, sister.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.007
After what he
put me through?

02:13.091 --> 02:14.717
I can hardly
believe it myself.

02:14.884 --> 02:16.261
Look, what we must do is

02:16.344 --> 02:19.097
make sure that cosmic justice
rains down upon him,

02:19.430 --> 02:21.683
for once we obtain
the good general's card,

02:21.766 --> 02:22.976
there ain't hardly
nothing standing

02:23.059 --> 02:24.519
in between us and Mr. Feng's

02:24.602 --> 02:27.188
$125 million.

02:30.984 --> 02:34.070
I was born on
a mountainside.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.197
Just keep both hands
on the camera.

02:36.573 --> 02:37.740
Let's go.

02:50.795 --> 02:51.880
That's great.

02:51.963 --> 02:53.131
Okay.

02:53.214 --> 02:54.424
Thank you so much, Dr. Malden.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.552
Yeah, he can see you
today at 3:00.

02:57.635 --> 02:58.928
-No.
-We're going.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.431
We need to finish
what we started.

03:01.598 --> 03:02.473
We can do this.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.475
I need one more day.

03:06.227 --> 03:08.813
Michael, Dr. Malden
can see you today.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.773
He's given us his word

03:10.857 --> 03:12.108
he won't alert
the authorities.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.319
If you put this off
and you, you collapse,

03:14.402 --> 03:16.487
you're going to be
treated by another doctor.

03:16.571 --> 03:17.447
Do you want to
roll the dice

03:17.530 --> 03:19.115
that they're not going
to call the cops?

03:19.199 --> 03:23.411
There's still so much to do.

03:32.587 --> 03:35.548
All right.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.343
Three o'clock?

03:41.471 --> 03:44.349
Last time I drilled
a hole in the wall,

03:44.432 --> 03:47.310
it was with an eggbeater back
in Fox River with Michael.

03:47.393 --> 03:51.105
I just can't believe
it's all coming to an end,

03:51.189 --> 03:53.983
and he's not here.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.735
He'll be all right.

03:55.818 --> 03:58.571
How do you know?

03:58.655 --> 04:00.365
I don't.

04:00.448 --> 04:04.535
I'm just trying to
keep us focused.

04:04.619 --> 04:05.787
Hey.

04:05.870 --> 04:06.955
He's sick,

04:07.038 --> 04:08.831
but I guarantee
you one thing

04:08.915 --> 04:10.750
that'll make
him worse--

04:10.833 --> 04:13.086
going back
to jail.

04:15.421 --> 04:20.426
If we don't get in there...
that's where we're all going.

05:14.856 --> 05:18.318
He's going
to be okay.

05:18.401 --> 05:19.402
I'm scared, too,

05:19.485 --> 05:21.863
but a hospital's the best
place for him right now.

05:21.946 --> 05:25.366
He won't go without a plan
to complete the job.

05:25.450 --> 05:29.787
Well, Alex and Fernando
should be back soon

05:29.871 --> 05:31.539
with the video, right?

05:31.622 --> 05:32.707
Should be, yeah.

05:32.790 --> 05:36.502
So, then, all we need
is the sixth card.

05:36.586 --> 05:37.545
Gretchen's working on that.

05:37.628 --> 05:39.922
You really think
we can trust her?

05:40.006 --> 05:42.508
With the card?

05:42.592 --> 05:43.676
Absolutely.

05:43.760 --> 05:44.719
Anything else?

05:44.802 --> 05:47.013
Nope.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.438
Eight guards will accompany
Scylla from the basement bunker

05:55.521 --> 05:58.274
up to the garage, where an
armored truck will be waiting.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.568
One truck is not going
to be enough security.

06:00.651 --> 06:02.737
That is why I have a full
Secret Service escort

06:02.820 --> 06:04.447
to March Air Force Base.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.449
There, it will be
brought aboard a C-130.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.826
We need air support
all the way to River Rock.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.287
Colonel Rififi is lending
us three of his F-18s.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.872
It may be hard for
you to believe,

06:12.955 --> 06:14.707
but I do have this
under control.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.292
There's nothing for
you to worry about.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.799
When the plane lands, the same
precautions will be taken.

06:22.882 --> 06:23.925
Armored truck

06:24.008 --> 06:26.552
to guards, to final location.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.140
That's fine.

06:34.102 --> 06:36.104
Are you going somewhere?

06:36.187 --> 06:39.107
I have an
appointment. Today?

06:39.190 --> 06:42.151
You told me there was
nothing to worry about.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.654
Just tell me
it's not Gretchen.

06:46.155 --> 06:47.240
This is ridiculous.

06:47.323 --> 06:48.408
It's a personal
matter.

06:48.491 --> 06:49.867
I'm not going to discuss it.

06:49.951 --> 06:50.993
I don't trust her.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.203
That's nothing new.

06:52.286 --> 06:54.705
I'll be back
in an hour.

07:02.505 --> 07:04.507
What'd you find out?

07:04.590 --> 07:05.508
You'll be awake the whole time.

07:05.591 --> 07:07.969
The only anesthetic
you're going to need is

07:08.052 --> 07:09.470
four minor
injections of local--

07:09.554 --> 07:12.515
two in your forehead and two
in the back of your head.

07:12.598 --> 07:13.850
And that's for the brace?

07:13.933 --> 07:15.226
The frame,
yeah, and...

07:15.309 --> 07:18.104
attaching that is going to be
the most uncomfortable part.

07:18.187 --> 07:21.899
They're going to have to secure
four pins into your skull

07:21.983 --> 07:24.110
and they're going to need
a small drill to do it.

07:24.193 --> 07:25.987
Do we have to listen to this?

07:26.070 --> 07:27.321
I want to hear this, Linc.

07:27.405 --> 07:29.323
And then what?

07:29.407 --> 07:31.325
Uh, another
CT scan.

07:31.409 --> 07:32.368
The doctor will use

07:32.452 --> 07:33.578
the three-dimensional
imagery to pinpoint

07:33.661 --> 07:35.455
the exact location
of the growth.

07:35.538 --> 07:36.873
And once you have that?

07:36.956 --> 07:38.124
Then it's the gamma knife unit.

07:38.207 --> 07:40.251
They'll fit you
with a helmet,

07:40.334 --> 07:42.795
they'll calibrate it so
that each of the 201 holes

07:42.879 --> 07:46.883
are aimed directly for the tumor,
and at that point...

07:46.966 --> 07:48.301
I've got two more boxes in the car

07:48.384 --> 07:51.262
that you guys got
to bring in yourself.

07:52.513 --> 07:54.807
All right.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.267
You okay?

07:56.350 --> 07:58.227
-Because the last time I saw you...
-Yeah, I'm fine.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.229
I was just a little dehydrated.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.522
All right, good.

08:01.606 --> 08:02.607
This is the stuff you requested.

08:02.690 --> 08:04.442
You sure
this is gonna get you in?

08:04.525 --> 08:06.194
Let us worry about getting in.

08:06.277 --> 08:07.445
You worry
about how we're getting out.

08:07.528 --> 08:10.156
I got someone keeping an eye
on Gretchen and Bagwell.

08:10.239 --> 08:12.325
If they try anything,
they're getting taken out.

08:12.408 --> 08:15.870
Nothing is going to get
between us and Scylla.

08:15.953 --> 08:18.456
You sure you're all right?

08:19.957 --> 08:21.417
Yeah, it's just, uh,

08:21.501 --> 08:23.711
you know, we're breaking
into Company headquarters,

08:23.794 --> 08:27.465
and, uh, you'll understand
why we're all a little on edge.

08:27.548 --> 08:28.925
Understood.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.134
You know, I was thinking,

08:30.218 --> 08:31.761
when your father approached
me about doing this,

08:31.844 --> 08:33.179
I felt like I was, uh,

08:33.262 --> 08:35.097
chasing a ghost
or something, but...

08:35.181 --> 08:36.599
'cause of the work
you guys have done,

08:36.682 --> 08:40.520
today is the day we're gonna
take these bastards down.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.452
You get it?

08:56.536 --> 08:58.454
Got it.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.708
We got four hours.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.043
How come?

09:04.126 --> 09:05.586
I'm going in for treatment.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.427
Here we go.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.304
Scylla.

09:15.388 --> 09:19.892
Obviously,
we've got a lot to figure out.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.727
We have to break
through two walls--

09:21.811 --> 09:24.063
one concrete, one glass--

09:24.146 --> 09:26.315
and do it
without making a sound.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.985
Hypersensitive
parabolic microphones,

09:29.068 --> 09:30.528
pointed in all directions.

09:30.611 --> 09:31.487
The floor sensors
can detect

09:31.571 --> 09:34.323
an added surface load
of just two pounds.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.117
So...

09:36.200 --> 09:39.662
we have to traverse the
distance between the two walls

09:39.745 --> 09:41.122
without touching the floor

09:41.205 --> 09:43.708
and do all that
without generating any kind

09:43.791 --> 09:46.002
of body heat whatsoever.

09:46.085 --> 09:50.339
Of course they have the latest
in heat-sensing technology.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.050
We make one wrong move,

09:53.134 --> 09:56.012
the camera goes on, and General
Krantz knows we're inside.

09:56.095 --> 09:57.346
It's amazing.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.056
All this security
and only one man

09:59.348 --> 10:00.850
has access to
video surveillance?

10:00.933 --> 10:02.310
The Company doesn't want
any record

10:02.393 --> 10:03.728
of what's going on down there.

10:03.894 --> 10:05.104
Can we access that elevator?

10:05.187 --> 10:06.188
No, it's right in the middle

10:06.272 --> 10:07.982
of the Company building--
there are ten layers

10:08.065 --> 10:09.317
of security.
We have to go where they're

10:09.400 --> 10:10.484
not expecting us,

10:11.027 --> 10:12.570
starting with the
concrete wall.

10:12.653 --> 10:14.238
Sucre, you were drilling there,
right?

10:14.363 --> 10:16.407
It's fortified with steel
fibers, just like you said.

10:16.490 --> 10:17.533
All right,
in order to get

10:17.617 --> 10:19.910
through that,
we have to generate

10:19.994 --> 10:22.622
an electromagnetic field...

10:27.168 --> 10:30.838
We have to generate
an electromagnetic field...

10:33.257 --> 10:34.592
To have, uh,

10:34.675 --> 10:35.968
an electromagnetic field

10:36.052 --> 10:37.803
with the force that we
want, we're going to need

10:37.887 --> 10:39.221
at least a couple
of car batteries.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.723
Can you get that?

10:41.223 --> 10:42.892
Yeah, yeah.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.436
We can do this.

10:49.231 --> 10:51.317
Uh, what time are we
expecting Gretchen

10:51.400 --> 10:53.611
to get that sixth card?

11:04.080 --> 11:05.956
What took you so long?

11:07.500 --> 11:09.794
You know how I get
when I'm hungry.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.630
It wasn't easy getting
away from the office.

11:12.713 --> 11:14.840
I could have come to you...

11:14.924 --> 11:16.384
like old times.

11:18.636 --> 11:21.514
I almost wish there was
a mahogany desk in here.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.770
Oh... you're tense.

11:29.397 --> 11:30.439
Take off this jacket.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.233
Let me get in there.

11:39.907 --> 11:42.326
I didn't bring
it with me.

11:42.410 --> 11:43.411
My card.

11:43.494 --> 11:46.122
That is what you're
looking for, right?

11:46.497 --> 11:48.457
What are you talking about?
Your card.

11:48.541 --> 11:52.420
You forget. I'm the one that
taught you how to lie.

11:53.838 --> 11:56.716
I never thought that,
at the age of 63,

11:57.299 --> 11:59.844
I could still have
my heart broken.

12:00.511 --> 12:02.638
Why did you feel you
needed to steal my card?

12:02.722 --> 12:05.015
Don't you know that if you'd
waited just a little bit longer,

12:05.099 --> 12:07.643
you'd have had
one of your own?

12:07.727 --> 12:08.811
I'm sorry. I'm...

12:10.062 --> 12:11.021
Who are you
selling it to?

12:11.105 --> 12:12.481
That's-That's not why...

12:12.565 --> 12:13.983
Who?

12:15.484 --> 12:17.737
I'm the mother of your child.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.823
Please, for Emily's sake.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.492
Please, Jonathan.

12:23.951 --> 12:24.952
Please.

12:25.035 --> 12:27.371
I love you.

12:36.213 --> 12:39.008
If I ever see you again...

12:39.091 --> 12:41.594
I'll shoot you on sight.

12:57.568 --> 12:58.861
Is everything all right, Cole?

12:59.445 --> 13:01.655
I got something important
you need to know.

13:03.741 --> 13:04.825
We're gonna be rich.

13:06.952 --> 13:08.871
So, here's the question.

13:08.954 --> 13:11.165
How much is it gonna cost me

13:11.248 --> 13:13.083
to get that jacket
off of you?

13:13.167 --> 13:14.335
Excuse me?

13:14.418 --> 13:16.504
Last day I'm ever
gonna see you.

13:16.587 --> 13:17.671
Oh.

13:17.755 --> 13:19.340
You're all covered up.

13:19.423 --> 13:21.217
I cannot abide. $100.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.302
You want to pay me to
take my clothes off?

13:23.385 --> 13:25.012
-Not all of them. Just the jacket.
-Mm.

13:25.095 --> 13:27.848
-$200.
-I'm not gonna strip for you.

13:27.932 --> 13:28.891
Pity on an old man.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.726
You're disgusting.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.020
And lecherous and vile.

13:33.103 --> 13:35.356
And soon to be wealthy
beyond belief.

13:35.439 --> 13:37.858
One thousand dollars.

13:37.942 --> 13:40.027
Why so modest all of a sudden?

13:40.110 --> 13:43.864
Cole, I need to see you
in my office now.

13:43.948 --> 13:46.075
Mm-mm...

13:47.201 --> 13:50.704
Thank you for calling Gate.
How can I help you?

13:52.540 --> 13:55.918
It was Mr. White in his office
with the lead stapler.

13:56.001 --> 13:59.797
Cole, yesterday,
with that Idaho group,

13:59.880 --> 14:02.675
you made this
company $35,000.

14:04.385 --> 14:07.555
And I would like to
return the favor.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.350
It's our
annual cruise.

14:11.433 --> 14:14.353
Seven days and six nights
of non-stop pitching.

14:14.436 --> 14:17.523
I personally clear
$50,000 on most trips,

14:17.606 --> 14:21.443
but for everything
you've done,

14:21.527 --> 14:22.778
it's all yours.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.446
The least I could do.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.907
It leaves today?

14:26.991 --> 14:28.576
Go home and pack.

14:28.659 --> 14:30.202
I'll see you in a week.

14:32.621 --> 14:35.040
Unfortunately,
I have some business

14:35.124 --> 14:37.418
I need to take care of
right here.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.679
Okay, so, this is
how it works.

14:48.762 --> 14:52.349
As soon as the sensors pick up
any kind of a heat source

14:52.433 --> 14:54.852
90 degrees or more,
system goes into standby,

14:54.935 --> 14:55.895
a yellow light comes on.

14:55.978 --> 14:57.313
After five seconds in standby,

14:57.396 --> 14:59.648
if the heat source isn't gone,
we have an alarm.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.651
So we got six seconds
to make it across the hallway

15:02.735 --> 15:03.652
and through the glass wall?

15:03.736 --> 15:05.279
Basically.

15:05.362 --> 15:07.531
If we get our hands
on some liquid nitrogen,

15:07.615 --> 15:09.491
we could regulate
the temperature.

15:09.575 --> 15:10.868
Yeah.

15:10.951 --> 15:12.786
Kill two birds
with one stone.

15:12.870 --> 15:15.122
See if you can get
some of that.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.428
Hey.

15:29.803 --> 15:31.305
Hey.

15:33.432 --> 15:36.060
I'm not going
to ask how you're feeling.

15:36.143 --> 15:38.020
Good.

15:38.103 --> 15:41.190
About four years
after I joined the bureau,

15:41.273 --> 15:43.901
my first special agent
in charge--

15:43.984 --> 15:46.570
he was diagnosed
with liver cancer.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.280
But for him,

15:48.364 --> 15:49.949
the hardest part
wasn't the treatment.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.492
The hardest part
was leaving the office,

15:51.575 --> 15:54.161
because we had this...
we had this big RICO case

15:54.244 --> 15:56.455
that was about to go to trial,

15:56.538 --> 15:58.958
and we're talking thousands

15:59.041 --> 16:01.293
of man hours,
five years of research.

16:01.377 --> 16:04.129
And the guy was going
to be in chemo.

16:05.756 --> 16:08.384
And he was scared.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.386
He was scared that
we were gonna lose the case,

16:10.469 --> 16:13.222
and that a lot of bad men
were gonna walk.

16:13.305 --> 16:15.891
Let me guess: He had a
ragtag band of criminals

16:15.975 --> 16:17.893
ready to pick up the slack.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.440
Yeah, something like that.

16:27.528 --> 16:29.947
We're not going
to let you down, Michael.

16:34.952 --> 16:37.287
What happened to your boss?

16:38.330 --> 16:40.666
Oh, he was there to see us win.

16:51.218 --> 16:53.095
You're sure she's a Fed?

16:53.178 --> 16:54.763
Wouldn't take off her jacket
for a thousand dollars.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.557
She's got a gun
under there.

16:56.640 --> 16:57.766
It's a complication.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.393
Well, that's a nice
way to put it.

16:59.476 --> 17:01.353
Sort of like
you not getting the sixth card.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.313
What are we calling
that now, a setback?

17:03.397 --> 17:04.273
Relax.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.900
You have any idea what
I'm giving up here?

17:06.984 --> 17:09.403
I was guaranteed 50 grand.

17:09.486 --> 17:11.780
You're crying over $50,000?
Are you serious?

17:11.864 --> 17:12.990
I have a job.

17:13.073 --> 17:14.533
I make money. I get mail.

17:14.616 --> 17:15.993
People call me sir.

17:16.076 --> 17:18.162
Working 12-hour days
and eating leftover lo-mein.

17:18.245 --> 17:19.872
Something tells me
Theodore Bagwell

17:19.955 --> 17:21.749
wouldn't last long
in this situation.

17:21.832 --> 17:23.584
Yeah, maybe,

17:23.667 --> 17:26.336
but Cole Pfeiffer would.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.964
You want to pout,
you do it tomorrow.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.966
We have work to do.

17:33.343 --> 17:35.637
Is it really
worth $125 million?

17:35.721 --> 17:36.764
It's worth twice as much.

17:36.847 --> 17:38.932
What if they refuse
to hand it over?

17:39.016 --> 17:42.061
Either we pay for Scylla,
or we kill for it.

17:53.322 --> 17:55.574
Susan.

17:55.657 --> 17:58.077
Feng, we need to talk.

18:06.126 --> 18:09.046
Hey, give me a second
here, guys, just a second.

18:09.129 --> 18:12.508
We can't make any noise
above ten decibels.

18:12.591 --> 18:14.384
You got two of those?

18:14.468 --> 18:16.345
Absolutely.

18:17.638 --> 18:18.680
This is gonna work, right?

18:18.764 --> 18:20.432
It should.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.434
No, not just that.

18:22.518 --> 18:23.852
The whole thing.

18:23.936 --> 18:27.356
I mean,
do we even have a chance?

18:27.439 --> 18:30.067
Just make sure
the hole is in the right place.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.784
So, where are we?

18:38.867 --> 18:41.620
Gretchen didn't get us
the sixth card.

18:42.704 --> 18:44.373
We need that sixth card, Don.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.166
I know.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.335
If we don't get the sixth card,
we're never gonna crack Scylla.

18:48.418 --> 18:49.503
I know it.

18:49.586 --> 18:53.465
What else do we know?
What else do we know?

18:53.549 --> 18:55.092
Well, we know they're
moving Scylla today.

18:55.175 --> 18:57.636
We know we can't just waltz
into the General's office

18:57.719 --> 18:58.720
and steal that last card,

18:58.804 --> 18:59.721
so where does
that leave us?

18:59.805 --> 19:01.265
Then there's got to be a way.

19:01.348 --> 19:04.143
-There has to be a way.
-Not without losing another man.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.436
Believe me, I spent the last
week trying to figure out

19:06.520 --> 19:08.438
how to get that sixth card,
and every scenario ends

19:08.522 --> 19:11.108
with a gun to someone's head,
and that is not acceptable.

19:14.027 --> 19:16.572
You know, Gretchen did
pass on this one piece

19:16.655 --> 19:18.574
of information for you.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.617
This could be helpful.

19:28.375 --> 19:30.627
Hello?

19:32.671 --> 19:34.089
The buyer just showed up.

19:34.173 --> 19:38.010
All right, well,
find out what they're up to.

19:38.093 --> 19:41.638
Mr. Feng, so glad
you could come and see us.

19:41.722 --> 19:43.098
I was expecting the next time

19:43.182 --> 19:45.767
the three of us would be
in the same room together,

19:45.851 --> 19:47.686
that you'd have something
for me.

19:47.769 --> 19:50.230
That was our
expectation, as well,

19:50.314 --> 19:53.066
but we've hit a few
bumps in the road.

19:53.150 --> 19:55.152
Now, to ensure
the item's

19:55.235 --> 19:58.447
safe recovery,
we need your help.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.636
It's time to go.

20:24.681 --> 20:27.851
"All that avails is flight."

20:27.935 --> 20:30.520
Maybe my father
was onto something.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.314
If they all die

20:32.397 --> 20:34.066
because we tried
to take down the Company,

20:34.149 --> 20:36.193
and I survive because...

20:36.276 --> 20:38.612
because I called in sick...

20:39.863 --> 20:42.241
...how am I gonna live
with myself?

20:51.250 --> 20:53.210
You're gonna
get through this.

20:53.293 --> 20:55.254
I'm not going to the hospital.

20:56.463 --> 20:58.173
What?

20:59.841 --> 21:01.510
Linc, just get in the car.

21:02.386 --> 21:03.553
I'm going with you.

21:29.496 --> 21:30.872
If I still had
a medical license,

21:30.956 --> 21:32.666
I'd lose it over this.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.627
This is usually given
to epileptics.

21:35.711 --> 21:38.005
It will suppress
the rapid firing of neurons

21:38.088 --> 21:39.548
for the next three hours,

21:39.631 --> 21:40.632
making it unlikely

21:40.716 --> 21:42.718
that you'll have a seizure
in that time,

21:43.135 --> 21:46.013
but Michael, any added mental
or physical stress...

21:46.513 --> 21:47.389
I get it.

21:47.472 --> 21:48.640
I mean it.

21:48.724 --> 21:51.643
I don't want you to move
unless you absolutely have to.

21:51.727 --> 21:54.646
And as soon as this is over,
I'm taking you to the hospital.

22:05.907 --> 22:07.034
Hey.

22:08.702 --> 22:10.454
You all right?

22:12.247 --> 22:14.708
This is gonna go
exactly as planned.

22:15.292 --> 22:16.418
I promise.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.755
I'm not praying for me.

22:23.383 --> 22:24.760
Let's go.

22:26.803 --> 22:28.055
You wanted to see me?

22:28.263 --> 22:30.307
It's the second Tuesday
of the month.

22:30.390 --> 22:32.809
Don't you have your Eagles
and Angels luncheon?

22:32.893 --> 22:34.436
I figured I'd
skip it today.

22:36.438 --> 22:39.316
You called me in here
to confirm my lunch plans?

22:40.317 --> 22:41.985
You were right.

22:42.319 --> 22:44.571
If it weren't for you,
this would be in the wind.

22:48.116 --> 22:50.202
Is she dead?
Let's just say

22:50.285 --> 22:52.621
she won't bother
either of us anymore.

22:53.121 --> 22:56.416
But I do want Scylla moved
right now.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.378
Our mechanics are on the
tarmac inspecting the C-130.

22:59.461 --> 23:01.129
When they sign off,
we'll be ready to move.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.632
Call the other card holders,
get them in here.

23:12.182 --> 23:15.018
Did, uh, Self call
you, uh, regarding

23:15.102 --> 23:17.771
a little snafu
with the General?

23:17.854 --> 23:19.272
Get out of my way.

23:19.356 --> 23:21.024
Just for, uh,
clarification's sake,

23:21.483 --> 23:25.779
the sixth card is part of the
to-do list, right, gentlemen?

23:49.469 --> 23:51.221
The game's afoot.

23:51.304 --> 23:52.931
Does Michael
have a way to get the card?

23:55.100 --> 23:56.768
I've worked with
Michael Scofield before,

23:56.852 --> 23:57.894
both with him and against him.

23:57.978 --> 23:59.187
There's no way
he's going down there

23:59.271 --> 24:01.231
without a plan
to finish the job.

24:01.481 --> 24:02.732
I got a call from an old friend.

24:02.816 --> 24:03.859
Heard Scylla was in play.

24:03.942 --> 24:05.944
He wants to know
if he can get in on it.

24:09.614 --> 24:10.824
A bidding war?

24:10.907 --> 24:12.742
He's prepared to offer 200.

24:13.952 --> 24:15.078
Is he for real?

24:15.162 --> 24:16.413
I don't know.
I've set up a safe house

24:16.496 --> 24:17.789
where we can hear him out.
Do you have a pen?

24:18.498 --> 24:19.791
Just a minute.

24:23.295 --> 24:24.629
1917 Piermont.

24:24.713 --> 24:26.798
One nine one seven

24:26.882 --> 24:28.133
Piermont-- got it.

24:28.216 --> 24:29.801
I'm on my way.

24:31.386 --> 24:32.971
Uh, good afternoon.

24:33.054 --> 24:34.639
Thank you for calling Gate.

24:35.807 --> 24:37.350
I got some last minute
negotiations

24:37.434 --> 24:38.977
with the buyer
to speak about.

24:39.060 --> 24:40.187
I'll be back
lickety-split.

24:40.270 --> 24:41.480
See you later.

24:41.563 --> 24:44.483
Mm-hmm. Can you
hold, please?

25:16.723 --> 25:18.558
All right.

25:18.642 --> 25:20.268
This is it.

25:21.228 --> 25:23.563
Now, does anyone
have any questions

25:23.647 --> 25:25.732
about what
they're supposed to do?

25:29.444 --> 25:32.197
That hole you drilled
in the wall this morning--

25:32.280 --> 25:36.076
once we get over there,
if we make too much noise,

25:36.159 --> 25:38.328
the sound waves will travel
through the wall

25:38.411 --> 25:40.830
and get picked up by the sensors
on the other side.

25:40.914 --> 25:44.751
So, from this point on,
we need absolute silence.

25:48.296 --> 25:51.466
Alex, good luck.

25:52.676 --> 25:54.844
You, too.

26:13.154 --> 26:14.322
We ready?

26:16.992 --> 26:19.828
All right.

26:58.908 --> 27:01.911
We have to break
through two walls--

27:01.995 --> 27:03.997
one concrete, one glass--

27:04.080 --> 27:06.207
and do it
without making a sound.

27:15.216 --> 27:17.636
In order to get through that,

27:17.719 --> 27:21.431
we have to generate
an electromagnetic field.

27:28.229 --> 27:30.106
To have

27:30.190 --> 27:31.900
an electromagnetic field
with the force

27:31.983 --> 27:33.026
that we want,
we're gonna need

27:33.109 --> 27:34.694
at least a couple
of car batteries.

27:45.914 --> 27:47.540
...starting
with the concrete wall.

27:47.624 --> 27:49.292
Sucre, you were drilling there,
right?

27:49.376 --> 27:51.795
It's fortified with steel
fibers, just like you said.
