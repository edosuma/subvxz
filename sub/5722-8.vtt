<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

00:09.509 --> 00:11.843
Someone put my name
in your kill box.

00:13.146 --> 00:14.213
It was the Russians.

00:14.281 --> 00:15.514
Want to tell me why
the Russians give a shit

00:15.582 --> 00:16.915
whether you're alive or dead?

00:16.983 --> 00:18.817
Because they don't want me
to see something

00:18.885 --> 00:20.886
in the documents
those hackers stole from you.

00:20.953 --> 00:24.590
Saul Berenson smuggled a thumb
drive out of the building

00:24.658 --> 00:26.458
<i>and then met with Otto Düring.</i>

00:26.526 --> 00:29.027
<i>There's only one person</i>
<i>Saul would go so far</i>

00:29.095 --> 00:30.128
<i>out on a limb for.</i>

00:30.197 --> 00:31.230
She's dead.

00:31.298 --> 00:32.264
What if she's not?

00:32.332 --> 00:33.964
Look, I agreed to do it
your way.

00:34.032 --> 00:35.466
The hiding out, the pills.

00:35.534 --> 00:37.302
I said yes.
Because I wanted to help you.

00:37.369 --> 00:39.370
Well, it didn't help you.
It didn't help anyone.

00:39.371 --> 00:43.008

00:44.534 --> 00:45.932
_

00:47.079 --> 00:48.346
It's definitely him.

00:48.414 --> 00:49.880
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:52.117 --> 00:53.318
Hello.

00:53.385 --> 00:55.353
Two men just
put Ahmed in a car.

00:56.955 --> 00:58.089
<i>Take him</i>

00:58.156 --> 00:59.389
straight to the airfield.

00:59.457 --> 01:00.958
Put him directly on the plane.

01:03.962 --> 01:05.830
Thank you, my friend.

01:05.897 --> 01:06.964
My guys
are good, no?

01:07.032 --> 01:08.298
What exactly are we doing here,

01:08.366 --> 01:09.600
- Saul?
- I don't know.

01:09.667 --> 01:11.168
I've never defected before.

01:11.236 --> 01:13.503
Fell in with some of the jihadis
released the other night

01:13.571 --> 01:14.772
from Plötzensee Prison.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.640
They want an escort
to the Syrian border.

01:16.708 --> 01:18.109
Might present us with
a paint-and-kill opportunity.

01:18.176 --> 01:19.210
I get close enough,

01:19.277 --> 01:21.011
you have the ordinance
standing by.

01:21.079 --> 01:22.012
I'm sorry to call you like this,

01:22.080 --> 01:23.013
but I have to talk to you.

01:23.081 --> 01:24.615
About what?

01:24.682 --> 01:26.617
Baghdad. I need to ask you
some questions about

01:26.684 --> 01:28.118
your time there
before I arrived.

01:28.185 --> 01:29.753
Can we meet somewhere?

01:29.820 --> 01:31.020
Sure.

01:31.088 --> 01:32.756
Okay. Talk soon.

03:28.602 --> 03:29.969
Where are we?

03:30.036 --> 03:32.104
Near Pristina.

03:32.172 --> 03:34.807
That's off the route.

03:34.875 --> 03:37.343
These people are helping
soldiers making <i>hijrah.</i>

03:37.411 --> 03:38.644
Yeah, but I didn't know

03:38.712 --> 03:40.380
that was part of the plan.

03:40.447 --> 03:41.581
I don't tell you everything.

03:41.648 --> 03:42.782
We should
push on

03:42.850 --> 03:44.083
to Turkey. I have contacts

03:44.150 --> 03:46.318
that can get us
across the Syrian border.

03:46.387 --> 03:50.122
First, we need to rest and eat.

03:50.190 --> 03:52.124
Get in the back.

03:52.192 --> 03:53.325
Why?

03:53.394 --> 03:54.594
You're
the enemy.

03:54.661 --> 03:56.095
Our hosts won't understand.

04:31.764 --> 04:33.532
- Salaam alaikum.
<i>- Wa alaikum as-salaam.</i>

04:53.251 --> 04:54.452
So?

04:54.519 --> 04:57.154
Nothing yet.

04:59.290 --> 05:01.492
She'll call.

05:01.560 --> 05:05.095
It's been over eight hours.

05:05.163 --> 05:06.296
She's being careful.

05:06.364 --> 05:07.965
She had a scare in Amsterdam.

05:08.032 --> 05:10.968
You said you'd be
waiting there for her.

05:11.035 --> 05:13.603
We rolled up Ahmed, didn't we?

05:13.671 --> 05:15.172
That's not the same thing.

05:15.239 --> 05:16.974
It amounts to the same thing.

05:17.041 --> 05:21.211
Now the only person who can
connect him to us is you.

05:21.279 --> 05:24.781
That's why I'm exactly the wrong
person to meet with her.

05:30.087 --> 05:33.889
Why don't you just finish this
once and for all?

05:35.858 --> 05:38.227
There have been
too many bodies already.

05:38.295 --> 05:42.298
Need to be smart
now.

05:42.366 --> 05:44.733
What's worrying you?

05:44.801 --> 05:46.735
We used to be close.

05:46.803 --> 05:49.205
- She'll see right through me.
- No, she won't.

05:49.272 --> 05:51.140
She reached out
to you.

05:51.208 --> 05:53.476
She trusts you.

05:53.543 --> 05:55.878
Alichka,

05:55.945 --> 05:58.047
patience.

05:58.115 --> 06:00.416
She'll call.

06:01.751 --> 06:03.285
She'll call with instructions.

06:03.353 --> 06:05.254
Then you'll meet.

06:05.322 --> 06:08.790
And you'll appear concerned
and helpful

06:08.858 --> 06:12.060
and lead her nowhere.

06:18.601 --> 06:19.535
The CCTV cameras in
the garage went dark

06:19.602 --> 06:21.436
just before
the abduction.

06:21.504 --> 06:25.273
- Probably disabled.
- What about the call he made from his room?

06:25.341 --> 06:27.576
Anything new?

06:27.644 --> 06:30.712
We need to talk.

06:30.780 --> 06:32.113
See if
that line

06:32.181 --> 06:34.215
to the front desk
was compromised in any way.

06:47.329 --> 06:48.930
Where is he?

06:48.997 --> 06:50.865
- Excuse me?
- You and I

06:50.933 --> 06:52.800
both know Saul wasn't abducted.

06:52.868 --> 06:56.265
It's a little early to rule
that out, don't you think?

06:56.272 --> 06:58.373
This has Mossad written all over it.

06:58.441 --> 07:00.875
I admit, it's crossed my mind.

07:00.943 --> 07:03.644
The question is,
did you aid and abet him?

07:03.712 --> 07:07.115
- Are you kidding me? - You insisted
on taking him back to the hotel.

07:07.183 --> 07:08.849
Because I knew he'd be
more comfortable there.

07:08.917 --> 07:11.586
I thought I could get
some answers out of him.

07:11.653 --> 07:12.887
And did you?

07:12.955 --> 07:15.323
You had the room wired.

07:15.391 --> 07:16.857
Listen to the tapes.

07:16.925 --> 07:18.460
I have.

07:18.527 --> 07:20.728
There's a 2 and a half minute gap,

07:20.796 --> 07:22.597
where he turned up the radio

07:22.664 --> 07:25.365
and ran the bathroom faucets
full-blast.

07:25.433 --> 07:27.602
What was that about?

07:27.669 --> 07:30.605
You really want to know?

07:32.474 --> 07:35.275
He told me he loved me.

07:35.343 --> 07:37.544
He asked me to help him.

07:37.613 --> 07:40.014
- And did you help him?
- I did not.

07:40.082 --> 07:41.882
And as long
as we're assigning blame here,

07:41.950 --> 07:45.552
if anyone drove him into
Etai Luskin's arms, it was you.

07:45.621 --> 07:48.055
What are you getting at?

07:48.123 --> 07:50.658
I just want Saul returned

07:50.726 --> 07:54.061
with as little damage to all
our reputations as possible.

07:55.930 --> 07:59.199
And what I'd do right now,
if I were you, I'd put in a call

07:59.267 --> 08:01.067
to Tel Aviv.

09:07.867 --> 09:10.202
Give us a minute, please.

09:10.269 --> 09:11.336
Sure.

09:17.110 --> 09:20.079
Dar Adal called our bluff.

09:20.146 --> 09:23.248
And Tovah Rivlin is on her way
to Berlin.

09:26.753 --> 09:29.554
So I'm fucked.

09:30.957 --> 09:34.292
As I see it,
you have two choices--

09:34.360 --> 09:39.163
either Tovah turns you
back over to the CIA

09:39.232 --> 09:41.366
or...

09:42.535 --> 09:44.603
What?

09:44.670 --> 09:47.672
Maybe I can get you to Israel.

09:47.740 --> 09:49.474
You mean defect for real.

09:49.542 --> 09:50.675
Well,
it wouldn't be

09:50.743 --> 09:52.043
a defection, per se.

09:52.111 --> 09:53.745
I don't care what you call it.

09:53.812 --> 09:57.148
- I can't do it.
- Why not?

09:57.216 --> 09:59.817
Might as well say we blew up
General Youssef's plane.

10:01.787 --> 10:02.787
What are
you doing?

10:02.855 --> 10:04.389
There's a third option.

10:04.457 --> 10:06.458
- Which is?
- I get out of your hair,

10:06.525 --> 10:08.059
spare you any more grief.

10:08.127 --> 10:10.061
At the same time,
give Carrie a few more days

10:10.129 --> 10:12.329
to get to the bottom of this.

10:16.334 --> 10:19.069
- What's going on?
- Stand aside.

10:19.137 --> 10:20.571
I have my orders, sir.

10:20.639 --> 10:22.606
Whose orders? The XO's?

10:22.674 --> 10:25.242
The Director's.

10:45.863 --> 10:48.298
Carrie. Are you okay?
I've been waiting for your call.

10:48.365 --> 10:51.367
I had to keep moving, make
sure I wasn't being followed.

10:51.435 --> 10:54.036
Followed? What's going on?

10:54.104 --> 10:55.271
I need to see you.

10:55.339 --> 10:58.207
Yeah, you said.
When can you come in?

10:58.275 --> 10:59.676
Not at your office. There's a...

10:59.743 --> 11:02.211
there's a village east
of Hamburg-- Reinbek.

11:02.279 --> 11:03.780
I've left instructions
for you there.

11:03.847 --> 11:05.080
Baghdad protocol.

11:05.148 --> 11:06.749
That's a five-hour drive.

11:06.817 --> 11:09.018
We've got a crisis here.
Can't you give me a little bit

11:09.085 --> 11:10.219
<i>more to go on?</i>

11:10.287 --> 11:12.322
<i>No, not on the phone.</i>

11:12.389 --> 11:15.090
Carrie, come on.

11:17.394 --> 11:19.629
It's Acrobat. He's alive.

11:19.697 --> 11:21.497
What?

11:21.565 --> 11:22.799
I just saw him,

11:22.866 --> 11:23.998
Allison, in Amsterdam.

11:24.066 --> 11:26.067
- You sure?
- Positive.

11:26.135 --> 11:29.070
That is beyond crazy.

11:29.138 --> 11:31.005
Tell me about it.

11:31.073 --> 11:33.442
- What the hell does it mean?
- I'm not sure.

11:33.509 --> 11:35.377
That's why I need to talk
to you. You knew him better

11:35.445 --> 11:37.245
than anyone.
You are the one person

11:37.313 --> 11:39.648
who can help me
put this together.

11:39.716 --> 11:41.950
So you'll meet me?

11:42.017 --> 11:43.952
Yeah.

11:45.154 --> 11:46.488
Reinbek.
Baghdad protocol.

11:46.556 --> 11:48.623
I have to go.

11:53.195 --> 11:56.164
_

12:50.818 --> 12:54.320
Carrie Orser.
I'm here to see Allison Stevens.

12:56.590 --> 12:59.425
A Ms. Carrie Orser
for Ms. Stevens.

12:59.426 --> 13:02.335
_

13:18.946 --> 13:20.879
<i>Carrie?</i>

13:20.948 --> 13:22.748
I'm Allison Stevens.

13:22.816 --> 13:24.850
Glad to finally meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

13:24.918 --> 13:26.151
Likewise.

13:26.218 --> 13:28.620
My office is this way.

13:28.688 --> 13:30.722
- Where'd you fly in from?
- Washington.

13:30.790 --> 13:33.258
I spent a couple weeks
at home, with family.

13:33.326 --> 13:35.961
- Husband and kids?
- Uh, father and sister.

13:37.096 --> 13:38.530
Ms. Stevens.

13:38.598 --> 13:40.933
Your Honor, I-I thought
our meeting was tomorrow.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.033
It is.
I'm here on another matter.

13:43.101 --> 13:45.470
Your Honor, this
is Carrie Orser.

13:45.537 --> 13:48.238
She's gonna be taking over for
me when I leave next month.

13:48.306 --> 13:50.741
Carrie, this is
Judge Samir Khalil,

13:50.809 --> 13:53.578
one of the preeminent
jurists in Baghdad.

13:53.645 --> 13:54.779
<i>Ahlan wa sahlan.</i>

13:54.847 --> 13:56.046
<i>Ahlan wa sahlan.</i>

13:56.114 --> 13:57.414
I am honored to meet

13:57.483 --> 14:00.250
the new second secretary
of civil governance.

14:00.318 --> 14:02.519
The judge is working with
us in improving security

14:02.587 --> 14:04.053
in the Ministry
of Justice.

14:04.121 --> 14:06.089
It's a terrible
struggle.

14:06.156 --> 14:07.891
Many people dying.

14:07.959 --> 14:10.093
So much chaos.

14:10.160 --> 14:13.930
But success is possible
if we don't give up.

14:13.998 --> 14:15.398
Judge...

14:15.466 --> 14:17.534
Carrie's just
arrived.

14:17.602 --> 14:19.168
Yes.
I'm sorry.

14:19.236 --> 14:22.105
You must be exhausted.

14:22.172 --> 14:23.807
And I'm talking your ear off.

14:23.875 --> 14:24.974
No, not at all.

14:25.042 --> 14:26.575
We will meet tomorrow, yes?

14:26.643 --> 14:28.378
Yes, all of us.

14:28.445 --> 14:32.648
I have matters of the utmost
urgency to discuss.

14:32.716 --> 14:35.284
I'm glad you are here.

14:35.352 --> 14:37.353
We need all the help we can get.

14:39.456 --> 14:41.157
Carrie.

14:52.235 --> 14:54.336
You want a drink?

14:54.404 --> 14:56.471
Um, sure.
Just a small one.

14:58.241 --> 15:00.175
No ice.
Sorry.

15:00.243 --> 15:02.244
I used to keep a
little fridge in here,

15:02.311 --> 15:04.112
but, uh, the electricity's

15:04.180 --> 15:06.949
not exactly reliable.

15:07.017 --> 15:09.050
Saul speaks highly of you.

15:09.117 --> 15:10.685
I learned a lot from him.

15:10.753 --> 15:13.387
Me, too.

15:13.455 --> 15:17.291
Welcome
to Operation Iraqi Freedom.

15:18.260 --> 15:19.761
It's that bad, huh?

15:19.828 --> 15:21.763
Worse.
Sit.

15:26.868 --> 15:28.035
Look, there's no question

15:28.102 --> 15:30.971
it's an exciting post.
You'll learn a lot.

15:31.039 --> 15:34.741
Not to mention, it's a
major plus in your file.

15:34.809 --> 15:36.409
Yeah...

15:36.477 --> 15:38.278
and?

15:40.281 --> 15:41.748
You really
want the truth?

15:41.816 --> 15:43.717
Sure.

15:43.785 --> 15:45.118
We've just hit

15:45.186 --> 15:47.454
2,000 US dead
since the invasion.

15:47.521 --> 15:50.723
IEDs, EFPs, suicide bombers,

15:50.791 --> 15:52.525
death squads.

15:52.593 --> 15:54.760
We've got it all, plus
a raging insurgency,

15:54.828 --> 15:56.362
and we're
supposed to build

15:56.430 --> 15:58.598
a functioning society
in the middle of that.

15:58.665 --> 16:01.534
What don't they get
in Washington?

16:01.602 --> 16:05.371
You can't shove democracy
down people's throats.

16:08.075 --> 16:10.710
Sorry.

16:10.777 --> 16:13.079
- I've been here too long.
- No, it's all right.

16:13.147 --> 16:15.615
I... I wanted to know.

16:15.682 --> 16:19.218
What I need is a couple
of months stateside.

16:19.285 --> 16:21.787
Where's home?

16:21.855 --> 16:23.656
Mm.

16:23.724 --> 16:25.257
Wisconsin.

16:25.325 --> 16:28.527
By way of Milan.

16:30.330 --> 16:31.631
To go shopping.

16:31.698 --> 16:34.199
First thing I'm
gonna do is burn

16:34.267 --> 16:36.235
every article of clothing
I've worn here.

16:36.302 --> 16:38.237
You can't get rid of the dust.

16:38.304 --> 16:41.140
Then it's two weeks
in the West Indies.

16:41.207 --> 16:42.607
St. Lucia.

16:42.675 --> 16:45.343
I'm living for it right now.

16:45.410 --> 16:48.079
There's a little bar on a beach.

16:48.147 --> 16:50.949
Banana Joe's.

16:51.017 --> 16:53.985
Best daiquiris on the planet.

16:54.053 --> 16:56.121
And the men are gorgeous.

17:06.598 --> 17:08.232
Otto.

17:08.300 --> 17:10.233
Carrie. Thank God.

17:10.301 --> 17:12.069
I've been worried about you.

17:12.137 --> 17:14.372
I'm okay.

17:14.439 --> 17:16.374
You always say that,
but are you really?

17:16.441 --> 17:20.478
I am. I mean,
for the time being, at least.

17:20.546 --> 17:23.146
Did you find the man
you were looking for?

17:23.214 --> 17:25.148
Yeah, I did, but...

17:25.217 --> 17:28.286
What? Did he help you?

17:28.353 --> 17:31.189
Not exactly,
but I have his laptop.

17:31.256 --> 17:32.557
His laptop?

17:32.624 --> 17:35.159
The problem is, I can't

17:35.227 --> 17:36.561
access the hard drive.

17:36.628 --> 17:38.329
It's password protected.

17:38.397 --> 17:40.431
I need Numan's help.
Is he still there?

17:40.499 --> 17:42.733
No, but I can find him.

17:42.801 --> 17:45.069
Great, thank you.

17:45.136 --> 17:47.071
Of course.

17:47.138 --> 17:48.672
And Otto?

17:48.739 --> 17:49.939
Yeah?

17:54.345 --> 17:56.246
Have you seen Jonas,
by any chance?

17:57.981 --> 18:00.417
No. Why?

18:03.053 --> 18:04.454
I was...

18:04.522 --> 18:07.890
just wondering
if he'd asked about me or...

18:07.958 --> 18:10.293
wanted to know where I was.

18:11.596 --> 18:14.163
Should I tell him
about your situation?

18:14.232 --> 18:16.666
No, it's fine.

18:16.734 --> 18:19.135
I'll just get Numan, then, hmm?

18:19.203 --> 18:22.171
And you-- you be careful.

18:22.240 --> 18:24.307
I will.

18:29.179 --> 18:30.847
<i>Eight judges were killed</i>

18:30.914 --> 18:32.181
in the last two months.

18:32.249 --> 18:34.217
Now they are
targeting lawyers,

18:34.284 --> 18:36.219
even clerks.
Anyone who supports

18:36.286 --> 18:37.820
the Iraqi transitional
government.

18:37.888 --> 18:39.155
I've brought up

18:39.223 --> 18:41.390
your concerns to the
first secretary on a number

18:41.458 --> 18:43.392
of occasions, and he's
taken them up the chain.

18:43.460 --> 18:45.261
You're like an echo--
repeating the same thing

18:45.328 --> 18:46.796
over and over again.

18:48.431 --> 18:50.633
Did you know that it was here,

18:50.700 --> 18:53.770
in my country, where laws
were first written down

18:53.837 --> 18:56.372
and organized
into a system?

18:56.439 --> 18:58.540
Of course, the Hammurabi Code.

18:58.608 --> 19:01.309
Yes. A code for justice.

19:01.377 --> 19:03.444
That everyone had to live by.

19:03.512 --> 19:06.248
Rich and poor.
Even the king.

19:06.315 --> 19:08.250
You said yesterday
that you had

19:08.317 --> 19:09.918
something urgent to tell us.

19:09.986 --> 19:11.286
I do.

19:11.353 --> 19:14.256
I think I know
who is selling the names

19:14.323 --> 19:17.625
and addresses
of the Sunni judges

19:17.693 --> 19:19.427
to the Shia
death squads.

19:19.495 --> 19:21.696
- It's Ahmed Nazari.
- You've mentioned

19:21.764 --> 19:23.431
- him before.
- Many times.

19:23.499 --> 19:26.301
And many times I've told you
an investigation is underway.

19:26.368 --> 19:27.936
He should have
been arrested by now.

19:28.004 --> 19:30.137
I doubt you'd want us to do that
without any evidence.

19:30.205 --> 19:31.738
Look into the way
he lives.

19:31.807 --> 19:35.342
Fancy clothes, watches.
On a clerk's salary...

19:35.410 --> 19:36.743
We're pursuing this,

19:36.812 --> 19:38.813
I assure you.
Y... Your Honor,

19:38.880 --> 19:41.615
I'm sorry, we're already late
for our next appointment.

19:41.683 --> 19:43.417
Yes, yes, your
staff meeting.

19:43.484 --> 19:45.286
Political
decisions.

19:45.353 --> 19:47.822
And all the while,

19:47.889 --> 19:50.624
<i>my</i> country
is circling the drain.

19:50.692 --> 19:51.859
Your Honor...

19:51.927 --> 19:54.661
I promise you
I will personally

19:54.729 --> 19:57.030
follow up on this Ahmed Nazari.

19:57.097 --> 19:59.765
Thank you, Ms. Orser.

20:02.069 --> 20:03.703
Ms. Stevens.

20:08.642 --> 20:10.176
No, you won't.

20:10.244 --> 20:11.777
What?

20:11.846 --> 20:13.012
Follow up.

20:13.080 --> 20:15.114
Why?

20:15.182 --> 20:17.583
Because Ahmed Nazari
is an asset of mine.

20:17.651 --> 20:20.486
Soon to be yours, hopefully.

20:22.155 --> 20:23.621
Tell me.

20:23.689 --> 20:26.591
Code name's Acrobat, and
his intel, more often than not,

20:26.659 --> 20:28.827
winds up in the President's
daily brief.

20:28.895 --> 20:29.895
Jesus.

20:29.963 --> 20:32.264
He's penetrated
the Mahdi Army.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.599
He's gotten close
to one of the commanders there.

20:34.667 --> 20:35.968
- That's impressive.
- Mm.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.569
When do I get to sit down
with him?

20:37.636 --> 20:39.004
As soon as possible.

20:39.072 --> 20:40.672
I'm not gonna
lie to you, though.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.275
The handover won't be easy.

20:43.343 --> 20:44.776
Why not?

20:44.844 --> 20:47.612
Acrobat's needy.
And venal.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.114
And a little paranoid.

20:50.182 --> 20:52.817
Plus, he has a thing for me.

20:52.885 --> 20:55.953
Hey, I've been there.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.730
Here.

21:10.002 --> 21:11.936
Guess I should
say thanks.

21:12.004 --> 21:15.373
The Prophet says a plate for one
is enough for two.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.775
Hmm.

21:17.842 --> 21:19.743
What are we still doing here?
We should be on the road.

21:21.212 --> 21:24.180
We had to pick up some things.
What things?

21:24.248 --> 21:27.083
Weapons?

21:27.151 --> 21:30.854
If Bibi wants you to know,
he'll tell you.

21:30.922 --> 21:33.123
We can't cross the
border with weapons.

21:33.190 --> 21:35.358
Unless Bibi wants to spend
the next ten years

21:35.427 --> 21:37.561
in a Bulgarian jail
that makes Plötzensee

21:37.629 --> 21:39.095
look like a health spa.

21:42.633 --> 21:45.435
You ever been to jail?

21:47.338 --> 21:49.772
You ever been in a war zone?

21:53.744 --> 21:55.812
Didn't think so.

22:07.757 --> 22:10.125
I left that vulnerable.

22:10.193 --> 22:12.227
About three moves ago.

22:15.966 --> 22:17.899
- Tovah.
- Etai.

22:17.968 --> 22:19.668
This is...

22:19.735 --> 22:21.403
I know who he is.

22:21.471 --> 22:23.905
He's the reason I catch a plane
at 5:00 in the morning.

22:23.974 --> 22:26.775
I need to speak
to him alone.

22:26.843 --> 22:28.844
You don't have the authority
to throw me out.

22:28.911 --> 22:31.280
I'm here
on the Director's orders.

22:31.348 --> 22:32.914
Acting with his authority.

22:36.719 --> 22:38.187
I'll take a walk.

22:39.622 --> 22:42.523
Please.

22:53.235 --> 22:55.370
Have you come here
out of some misguided notion

22:55.437 --> 22:57.138
of helping Israel?

22:57.206 --> 22:58.639
Helping?

22:58.707 --> 23:00.074
Do you want to defect?

23:00.142 --> 23:01.142
No.

23:01.210 --> 23:02.243
Offer us information?

23:02.311 --> 23:04.078
- No.
- Fine.

23:04.146 --> 23:06.514
Then I will take you back
to Dar Adal now,

23:06.581 --> 23:07.982
before you cause
an international incident.

23:08.050 --> 23:11.386
Well, there's something
you need to know first.

23:11.453 --> 23:13.121
If your little escapade
gets out,

23:13.188 --> 23:15.423
it's an embarrassment
for both our countries.

23:15.491 --> 23:18.158
Right now my agency

23:18.226 --> 23:20.093
is working very hard

23:20.161 --> 23:22.629
to prove that you murdered
General Youssef

23:22.696 --> 23:24.297
and his family.

23:24.365 --> 23:26.933
We warned you
not to pursue that strategy.

23:27.001 --> 23:29.702
And I relayed your objections
very clearly.

23:29.770 --> 23:31.571
Still, you went ahead
with the plan.

23:31.639 --> 23:34.374
I made a proposal
to the general.

23:34.442 --> 23:37.310
And somebody killed him.

23:37.378 --> 23:40.147
We had nothing to do with it.

23:40.214 --> 23:43.116
Of course not.

23:43.184 --> 23:45.085
Neither did I.

23:47.821 --> 23:51.058
It was the Russians.

23:51.125 --> 23:52.459
You have proof?

23:52.527 --> 23:53.760
Working on it.

23:53.827 --> 23:55.194
How are you working on it?

23:55.262 --> 23:57.764
I have an officer in the
field gathering evidence.

23:57.831 --> 23:59.866
I expect to hear
from her soon.

24:03.971 --> 24:06.739
The Russians have a stake
in keeping Assad in power.

24:06.807 --> 24:09.175
And Israel's enemies would love

24:09.242 --> 24:11.711
to blame the general's
murder on Mossad.

24:11.779 --> 24:13.846
They blame us
for everything else.

24:16.483 --> 24:18.751
How long will your officer
need to find this proof?

24:18.819 --> 24:20.954
I can't say.

24:21.021 --> 24:22.421
You have until tomorrow morning.

24:22.489 --> 24:24.023
It's not enough.

24:24.091 --> 24:26.059
It's all I can give you.

24:27.595 --> 24:29.228
This officer you spoke of--

24:29.296 --> 24:30.529
do you trust her?

24:30.597 --> 24:32.831
With my life.

24:32.899 --> 24:36.635
In our business,
that's not always a good policy.

24:50.250 --> 24:53.352
Use the FireWire cable
to connect your computer

24:53.420 --> 24:54.853
to Ahmed's.

25:05.197 --> 25:07.666
Okay, they're connected.
Now what?

25:07.734 --> 25:09.167
Now...

25:09.235 --> 25:12.170
I try to get into
Ahmed's computer through yours.

25:12.238 --> 25:14.773
I have to find a program
I can penetrate.

25:14.841 --> 25:16.808
How long is that gonna take?

25:16.876 --> 25:19.244
This dude's got
serious security.

25:19.311 --> 25:22.380
Numan, how long?

25:22.448 --> 25:23.782
30 seconds.

25:25.584 --> 25:28.520
Or 30 minutes.

25:28.587 --> 25:31.656
Or 30 days.

25:47.339 --> 25:49.774
Here we go.

26:00.117 --> 26:03.787
Carrie, this is Ahmed Nazari,

26:03.854 --> 26:06.223
our most valuable asset
in Baghdad.

26:06.291 --> 26:07.391
<i>Ahlan wa sahlan.</i>

26:07.458 --> 26:08.659
<i>Ahlan wa sahlan.</i>

26:08.726 --> 26:10.060
Allison's told me

26:10.127 --> 26:12.329
all about the important
work you do for us.

26:12.397 --> 26:14.198
I want you to know
I'm looking forward

26:14.265 --> 26:16.066
to continuing
this relationship.

26:16.133 --> 26:17.934
I told you, I won't work
with anyone else.

26:18.002 --> 26:20.637
Why don't we sit down
and talk about it?

26:20.705 --> 26:23.039
We've prepared some
tea and kanafeh.

26:24.942 --> 26:26.976
Do you think
I'm a child?

26:27.044 --> 26:29.378
You can tempt me
with cake?

26:30.547 --> 26:32.215
Ahmed, please...

26:32.282 --> 26:33.649
sit down.

26:33.718 --> 26:36.920
Listen to what
she has to say.

26:45.294 --> 26:48.163
I know you perform a valuable service,
and I know

26:48.231 --> 26:50.199
- the risks you take.
- How would you know?

26:50.266 --> 26:51.734
Carrie's an
experienced officer.

26:51.801 --> 26:53.168
I've worked

26:53.236 --> 26:55.370
with many men and women
like you-- patriots.

26:55.438 --> 26:57.706
She told you I would report
on the Mahdi Army?

26:57.774 --> 26:59.074
Yes.

26:59.142 --> 27:00.508
If they know I told you,

27:00.576 --> 27:03.011
they will drill holes in my head
with a power tool.

27:03.079 --> 27:04.679
I know this work is dangerous.

27:04.748 --> 27:06.414
One mistake, I die.

27:06.482 --> 27:07.916
We're trained
to avoid

27:07.984 --> 27:09.351
making those kinds of mistakes.

27:09.418 --> 27:11.186
Ahmed, I told you
when we started

27:11.254 --> 27:14.422
that there would come a time
when I would have to move on.

27:14.490 --> 27:17.726
Do you remember how long it took
for me to trust you?

27:17.793 --> 27:19.093
You were very careful.

27:19.161 --> 27:21.296
Why can't you stay?

27:21.364 --> 27:22.364
I have orders.

27:22.431 --> 27:23.632
Change the orders.

27:23.699 --> 27:25.032
This is a contract.

27:25.100 --> 27:28.303
I take the risks,
so I set the terms.

27:28.371 --> 27:32.607
I work with you, not her.
Those are the terms!

27:32.675 --> 27:36.378
Ahmed, I bet raising a family
in this city is expensive.

27:37.613 --> 27:39.781
If there's some aspect
of our relationship

27:39.848 --> 27:42.584
we can adjust to make you
more comfortable...

27:42.652 --> 27:44.385
You'll pay me more?

27:44.452 --> 27:46.620
We want you to be happy.

27:46.688 --> 27:49.290
You're <i>very</i> important to us.

27:49.357 --> 27:51.692
The president pays attention
to what you say.

27:51.760 --> 27:54.795
Your information saves lives.

27:54.862 --> 27:56.764
I'm sorry.

27:56.831 --> 27:58.865
I don't know you...

27:58.933 --> 28:01.168
and I can't trust you.

28:01.235 --> 28:04.338
You want the information
I bring...

28:04.406 --> 28:06.139
you stay.

28:07.275 --> 28:09.743
Ahmed, I'm... sure we can

28:09.811 --> 28:11.744
work something out.

28:12.880 --> 28:15.381
Aw, fuck.

28:16.984 --> 28:18.885
Do you think he's bluffing?

28:18.953 --> 28:21.054
He's a lawyer--
it's a negotiation.

28:21.122 --> 28:23.323
Let's give him a week
to think about it.

28:23.390 --> 28:25.258
I'll have another run
at him then.

31:47.153 --> 31:49.989
Why do you think I do this work?

31:50.056 --> 31:52.157
Because I love America?

31:52.225 --> 31:53.993
I made it clear to you
from the beginning--

31:54.060 --> 31:56.695
you don't work for me,
you work for the United States.

31:56.763 --> 31:59.297
It doesn't matter which officer
you report to.

31:59.365 --> 32:01.534
It matters to me.

32:03.870 --> 32:05.504
What are you doing?

32:05.572 --> 32:08.774
You know why I come here,
why I meet with you.

32:08.842 --> 32:11.577
Ahmed, I'm flattered.

32:11.645 --> 32:14.946
- You feel the same way?
- I like you, but this is

32:15.014 --> 32:16.948
a professional
relationship

32:17.016 --> 32:18.550
and an important one.

32:18.617 --> 32:21.152
And you can continue
that important work with Carrie.

32:21.219 --> 32:24.889
I'm afraid I don't agree.

32:24.957 --> 32:26.424
I'm leaving in two weeks.

32:26.491 --> 32:28.626
We have to settle this.

32:28.694 --> 32:31.729
Is it a question of
getting more money?

32:31.797 --> 32:33.998
I don't need more money.

32:42.106 --> 32:43.974
Come here.

32:44.042 --> 32:45.542
Please.

32:52.951 --> 32:55.185
Jesus.

32:55.252 --> 32:57.387
How did you get this?

32:57.455 --> 33:00.724
They keep the cash
in the basement of the ministry.

33:00.792 --> 33:03.359
Just sitting there...
on wooden pallets,

33:03.427 --> 33:05.495
like fish in the market.

33:05.563 --> 33:08.664
I take a little every day
in my briefcase...

33:08.732 --> 33:10.333
out the front door.

33:10.401 --> 33:12.302
You shouldn't
have shown this to me.

33:12.369 --> 33:14.337
I'm obliged to report it.

33:14.405 --> 33:16.272
Don't you understand?

33:16.340 --> 33:17.807
Understand what?

33:18.976 --> 33:21.544
This is for us to share.

33:23.347 --> 33:25.548
I am in love with you.

33:25.616 --> 33:28.118
I want us to be together.

33:28.185 --> 33:30.252
Ahmed, I'm
an intelligence officer.

33:30.320 --> 33:33.322
I can't have anything
to do with this.

33:33.389 --> 33:37.093
I have five more suitcases
at home just like this,

33:37.160 --> 33:38.861
filled with
American money.

33:41.297 --> 33:43.699
Over $8 million.

33:57.347 --> 33:59.814
Uh... just keep looking.
I'll be right back.

33:59.882 --> 34:01.816
All right.

34:05.921 --> 34:08.123
How'd it go with Acrobat?

34:08.190 --> 34:10.425
He went for it.

34:10.493 --> 34:12.194
He'll work with me?

34:12.262 --> 34:13.395
Yeah.

34:13.463 --> 34:15.063
Well, how'd you get him

34:15.130 --> 34:17.063
to change his mind?
More money?

34:17.132 --> 34:18.399
Exactly.

34:18.467 --> 34:20.333
Well, whatever it takes.

34:20.402 --> 34:21.835
I'll set up the meeting.

34:21.902 --> 34:24.103
- You'll have to brief me on the protocol.
- Sure.

34:24.172 --> 34:26.739
But he's going to Samarra
to visit his sister.

34:26.808 --> 34:29.543
Your meeting will have to wait
until he gets back.

34:29.610 --> 34:31.379
How long will he be gone for?

34:31.446 --> 34:32.746
Two to three weeks.

35:01.475 --> 35:03.343
Is it set?

35:04.746 --> 35:07.380
She wants me to walk
into the village,

35:07.448 --> 35:09.616
meet her at a café.

35:09.684 --> 35:11.251
Good.

35:12.620 --> 35:15.322
Valentin will be there.

35:17.525 --> 35:19.892
You said no more bodies.

35:19.960 --> 35:21.828
I reconsidered.

35:23.130 --> 35:24.931
Just in case she found

35:24.998 --> 35:28.567
some piece of the puzzle
we haven't anticipated.

35:28.635 --> 35:32.071
Something that
connects us to Ahmed.

35:32.139 --> 35:34.140
If she has...

35:34.208 --> 35:36.642
Valentin will be ready.

35:38.278 --> 35:40.847
You never tell me
the whole truth.

35:42.515 --> 35:47.686
My job is to protect you,
Alichka.

35:49.623 --> 35:51.858
This is my first priority.

35:51.925 --> 35:55.895
What will be your
signal to Valentin?

35:55.963 --> 35:58.364
I'll light a cigarette.

35:59.566 --> 36:01.801
And he'll take
care of her,

36:01.869 --> 36:04.771
if necessary.

36:04.838 --> 36:06.872
Very good.

36:34.934 --> 36:35.901
You're late.

36:35.968 --> 36:38.103
I have to be careful,
don't I?

36:38.171 --> 36:40.705
Uh... not here.

36:40.773 --> 36:43.108
When we're in some
beautiful place together.

36:43.176 --> 36:44.810
My orders came through.

36:44.877 --> 36:47.112
- I'm leaving in three days.
- Already?

36:47.180 --> 36:50.882
- Well, what am I supposed to do?
- Don't worry, I have it all worked out.

36:50.950 --> 36:53.551
Put the money into a trunk--
two at the most--

36:53.619 --> 36:56.021
and I'll have it shipped out
under diplomatic cover.

36:56.088 --> 36:58.056
You're leaving me?

36:58.124 --> 36:59.590
No.

36:59.658 --> 37:01.726
Here's a ticket
to Geneva,

37:01.794 --> 37:05.763
where you'll make a deposit
into an HSBC branch.

37:05.831 --> 37:08.466
Then instruct them
to wire the balance

37:08.534 --> 37:11.135
into this account
in the West Indies.

37:11.203 --> 37:13.304
I'll meet you there...

37:13.372 --> 37:15.906
in St. Lucia.

37:17.042 --> 37:18.443
Okay?

37:19.911 --> 37:22.380
Ahmed, what is it?

37:29.086 --> 37:30.954
You fucker!

37:34.091 --> 37:36.393
Excuse me, please.

37:42.500 --> 37:44.568
Go now.

37:49.741 --> 37:51.675
This proves nothing.

37:51.743 --> 37:53.276
You've got
nothing on me.

37:53.344 --> 37:54.878
You don't think so?

37:54.945 --> 37:56.246
See the cameras?

37:56.313 --> 37:57.413
One...

37:57.481 --> 37:58.748
two.

38:00.050 --> 38:02.852
You were caught red-handed,
as they say.

38:02.920 --> 38:06.322
At the very least, your tenure
at Central Intelligence is over.

38:06.390 --> 38:11.060
Most likely... you're facing
many years in federal prison.

38:12.396 --> 38:15.531
- I'll take my chances.
- Why?

38:15.599 --> 38:17.633
You haven't even heard
my proposal yet.

38:17.701 --> 38:20.036
I-I know what this is.
I'm not a traitor.

38:20.104 --> 38:22.004
I'm not asking you
to be a traitor.

38:22.071 --> 38:23.372
Oh, give me a break.

38:23.439 --> 38:25.908
Is this the part where
you tell me I'll never have

38:25.975 --> 38:28.576
- to compromise the security
of the United States? - Yes, it is,

38:28.644 --> 38:30.312
and it happens
to be truth.

38:30.380 --> 38:31.947
- Bullshit.
- Why bullshit?

38:32.015 --> 38:34.482
We're not
the Soviet Union anymore.

38:34.550 --> 38:37.352
Russian and American interests
are more aligned now

38:37.420 --> 38:39.021
than they've been
in the past 70 years.

38:39.088 --> 38:40.055
I suggest you sit down

38:40.123 --> 38:42.590
and listen to me.

38:45.228 --> 38:47.896
What have you got to lose?

38:55.571 --> 38:58.406
I believe
the more cooperation

38:58.474 --> 39:00.675
between our two countries,
the better--

39:00.743 --> 39:03.511
well, the <i>safer</i>

39:03.579 --> 39:05.580
the world will be.

39:05.648 --> 39:09.417
Yes, I know it sounds
a little naive.

39:09.485 --> 39:12.921
But it doesn't have to be.

39:12.988 --> 39:14.756
You see...

39:14.824 --> 39:17.725
this little spy game
we're playing here

39:17.793 --> 39:21.563
doesn't have to be
one-sided.

39:21.630 --> 39:25.366
I can pass intelligence
to you, too, Allison.

39:25.434 --> 39:27.168
Not bullshit.

39:27.235 --> 39:30.404
Real intelligence that will
help you rise in your career,

39:30.472 --> 39:34.342
just as me recruiting you
will help me

39:34.409 --> 39:36.710
rise in mine.

39:39.281 --> 39:41.382
I mean it.

39:41.450 --> 39:43.784
Allison...

39:43.852 --> 39:47.321
years from now, we could be
looking down at this moment

39:47.389 --> 39:50.624
from a very great height.

39:51.926 --> 39:54.995
I say let's be professionals,

39:55.062 --> 39:57.597
you and I.

39:57.664 --> 40:01.401
Let's help each other
make it to the very top,

40:01.469 --> 40:05.171
the summit...

40:05.239 --> 40:08.375
the roof of the world.

40:08.442 --> 40:11.677
Hmm?

40:13.481 --> 40:15.915
I know you,
Allison Carr.

40:15.983 --> 40:19.519
I know everything
about you.

40:19.586 --> 40:21.821
I know your ambitions.

40:21.889 --> 40:24.957
How hard you worked
to get to where you are.

40:25.026 --> 40:28.228
I even know what you're
thinking right now.

40:28.295 --> 40:30.262
Is that so?

40:30.330 --> 40:32.064
Mm-hmm.

40:32.132 --> 40:36.101
You're wondering
if the $8 million is for real.

40:36.169 --> 40:38.638
It is.

40:38.705 --> 40:41.206
And when we are done here
with this game,

40:41.274 --> 40:43.409
somewhere in
the not-too-distant future,

40:43.476 --> 40:46.812
half of it will be yours.

40:51.351 --> 40:53.118
Something

40:53.186 --> 40:57.456
to take the edge off
all of the uncertainty...

40:57.524 --> 41:00.927
that frightens you so.

41:49.507 --> 41:50.673
<i>Gut.</i>

42:10.728 --> 42:13.195
The main courthouse in Baghdad
has suffered a horrific attack.

42:13.263 --> 42:16.532
The State Department
estimates 134 dead,

42:16.600 --> 42:18.567
most of them employees
of the Ministry of Justice,

42:18.636 --> 42:20.236
making this
the most deadly attack

42:20.303 --> 42:22.772
- in Iraq in over a year.
- Allison, all hands, ops room.

42:22.840 --> 42:24.674
This is so fucked up.

42:24.742 --> 42:27.943
The harder we try,
the worse it gets.

42:28.011 --> 42:29.745
I heard Acrobat might've
been in the courthouse

42:29.812 --> 42:31.780
when it went down-- do you know
if that's been confirmed?

42:31.848 --> 42:34.215
His name's on the list
of fatalities.

42:34.283 --> 42:36.718
Oh, fuck!
That's bad luck.

42:36.786 --> 42:39.955
Well, at least
Judge Khalil's okay.

42:40.023 --> 42:42.090
He was on his way
to a meeting, apparently.

42:42.158 --> 42:43.091
Good.

42:43.159 --> 42:44.693
Come on, let's go.

43:10.451 --> 43:12.319
<i>Danke schön.</i>

43:19.294 --> 43:20.427
Carrie.

43:20.495 --> 43:22.762
Allison,
thanks for coming.

43:22.830 --> 43:24.030
I'm in hiding.

43:24.098 --> 43:25.465
My life's in danger.

43:25.533 --> 43:27.067
What are you talking about?

43:27.134 --> 43:28.602
The attack in Lebanon
at General Alladia camp,

43:28.670 --> 43:30.504
that bomb was meant for me.

43:30.572 --> 43:32.506
And there was another attempt
just yesterday in Amsterdam.

43:32.574 --> 43:34.407
Jesus, Carrie.

43:34.474 --> 43:36.942
I believe the SVR wants me dead.

43:37.010 --> 43:39.478
- Why? - Well, I'm hoping you can
help me figure that out.

43:39.546 --> 43:41.814
And you think this has something
to do with Acrobat?

43:41.881 --> 43:43.082
I know it does.

43:43.149 --> 43:44.517
Tell me.

43:44.585 --> 43:46.018
It all started

43:46.086 --> 43:47.620
with the cyber penetration
last month.

43:47.688 --> 43:49.154
There was a cable
among the hacked documents

43:49.223 --> 43:51.156
the Russians didn't
want me to see.

43:51.225 --> 43:52.692
Well, what cable was that?

43:52.759 --> 43:54.193
Was from Baghdad Station.

43:54.261 --> 43:55.828
Apparently, Samir Khalil
was demanding to speak to me.

43:55.895 --> 43:57.329
He said he had
important information.

43:57.396 --> 43:58.430
He was adamant about it.

43:58.497 --> 43:59.497
"Information"?

43:59.565 --> 44:01.934
That Ahmed Nazari was alive.

44:02.001 --> 44:04.636
Allison, listen,
did you,

44:04.704 --> 44:05.971
did you have any reason

44:06.039 --> 44:08.040
to question the intel
he was providing?

44:08.108 --> 44:09.441
No.

44:09.508 --> 44:10.976
No, his stuff was good.

44:11.044 --> 44:12.945
It always checked out.

44:13.012 --> 44:15.214
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

44:15.281 --> 44:19.016
And you never suspected him
of-of being a plant?

44:19.051 --> 44:20.417
Of playing both sides
against the middle?

44:22.020 --> 44:23.921
You have to consider
that possibility,

44:23.989 --> 44:27.691
but we were seriously
sweetening his pie.

44:27.760 --> 44:29.660
He'd have been risking a lot.

44:29.728 --> 44:31.428
Could you go back

44:31.496 --> 44:34.565
and review your old field
reports with that in mind?

44:34.633 --> 44:37.735
I-I could.

44:37.803 --> 44:39.871
But what?

44:39.938 --> 44:43.474
Well, they're classified
for one thing.

44:46.244 --> 44:47.878
Allison, please.

44:47.945 --> 44:49.313
They're trying to kill me.

44:49.381 --> 44:51.047
I've got no one else to turn to.

44:51.115 --> 44:52.449
I need this to end.

44:52.517 --> 44:53.617
I had a life.

44:53.685 --> 44:54.718
I want it back.

44:54.786 --> 44:56.019
Okay, okay.

44:56.087 --> 44:58.021
I'll see what I can do.

44:58.089 --> 45:00.223
On one condition.

45:02.493 --> 45:04.527
Name it.

45:04.595 --> 45:06.529
None of the hacked documents

45:06.597 --> 45:09.599
see the light of day ever again.

45:09.667 --> 45:10.966
They won't.

45:11.034 --> 45:14.236
I swear to you.

45:16.206 --> 45:17.707
Are you talking to anyone else

45:17.775 --> 45:19.041
about this?

45:22.379 --> 45:24.046
No.

45:24.114 --> 45:25.181
I told you
there is no one else.

45:25.248 --> 45:27.215
I'm counting on you to do this.

45:27.283 --> 45:28.749
And I just told you I would.

45:28.817 --> 45:30.250
You did.

45:30.319 --> 45:32.252
Yes, thank you.

45:42.096 --> 45:44.665
I'll be in touch
if I find anything.

45:44.733 --> 45:45.700
How do I contact you?

45:45.767 --> 45:46.867
Through Otto Düring.

45:46.935 --> 45:48.636
- Done.
- Thanks again, Allison.

45:48.704 --> 45:50.504
Really, I mean it.

45:50.572 --> 45:53.440
Watch your back, Carrie.

46:22.869 --> 46:25.270
What the fuck?

46:42.288 --> 46:45.156
What's this all about?

46:45.224 --> 46:46.658
Bibi told you to
stay out of sight.

46:46.726 --> 46:48.226
Get the rest of our stuff.

46:48.294 --> 46:50.795
We're changing trucks.

46:50.863 --> 46:52.196
Why?

46:52.264 --> 46:53.964
Picked up a few supplies.
We need more room.

46:54.032 --> 46:56.667
Bullshit-- you cannot
take weapons into Syria.

46:56.735 --> 46:59.270
What weapons?

46:59.337 --> 47:01.105
Yeah, right.

47:11.110 --> 47:11.964
_

47:11.965 --> 47:13.305
_

47:16.213 --> 47:17.130
_

47:17.246 --> 47:19.240
_

47:19.647 --> 47:21.359
_

47:21.502 --> 47:22.980
_

47:23.749 --> 47:25.295
_

47:25.961 --> 47:27.728
_

47:28.184 --> 47:28.897
_

47:29.252 --> 47:30.907
_

47:43.113 --> 47:45.415
Saul?

47:45.483 --> 47:47.851
You have to go.
They're coming.

47:47.919 --> 47:48.752
Hurry.

47:48.820 --> 47:49.920
What's happening?

47:49.987 --> 47:51.220
Tovah made a deal
with Dar Adal.

47:51.288 --> 47:53.323
He's on his way to get you.

47:53.390 --> 47:56.159
What?

47:56.226 --> 47:58.594
Where are we going?

47:58.662 --> 48:00.163
To someplace safe.

48:01.531 --> 48:04.133
You're gonna catch
a lot of shit for this.

48:04.201 --> 48:06.535
I'm a decorated veteran
of the Six Day War.

48:06.603 --> 48:07.870
I'll survive.

48:07.938 --> 48:10.873
Come on, come on,
this way.

49:17.105 --> 49:19.106
Carrie?

49:19.174 --> 49:21.042
- You there?
- I'm here.

49:21.109 --> 49:24.011
I'm in Ahmed's computer.

49:24.079 --> 49:26.881
We have to search it.

49:26.949 --> 49:28.383
Yeah, for what?

49:28.451 --> 49:30.952
Uh, it could be anything.

49:31.019 --> 49:33.454
Sorry, but we have
to narrow that down.

49:33.521 --> 49:35.456
I know.

49:35.523 --> 49:37.958
A name? Date?

49:38.025 --> 49:40.227
I thought I would have
something for us to go on,

49:40.294 --> 49:42.363
but I don't.

49:48.536 --> 49:50.504
What just happened?

49:50.572 --> 49:52.072
Just the screen saver.

49:52.139 --> 49:53.407
Push the space bar.

49:53.475 --> 49:56.510
That'll get rid of it.

50:01.416 --> 50:03.350
Numan?

50:03.418 --> 50:05.386
Google something for me.

50:05.453 --> 50:07.087
What?

50:07.154 --> 50:09.322
Uh...

50:09.390 --> 50:11.124
a bar, Banana Joe's.

50:11.192 --> 50:13.426
And then St. Lucia.

50:13.494 --> 50:15.362
Sorry, I don't understand.

50:15.429 --> 50:17.597
Just... Google it.

50:17.664 --> 50:19.032
<i>Welcome to Operation</i>

50:19.100 --> 50:21.301
Iraqi Freedom.

50:21.369 --> 50:23.036
That bad, huh?

50:25.472 --> 50:28.341
<i>Then it's two
weeks in the West Indies,</i>

50:28.409 --> 50:30.343
St. Lucia.

50:30.411 --> 50:31.945
I'm living for it right now.

50:32.013 --> 50:35.782
There's a little bar on a beach,
Banana Joe's...

50:35.849 --> 50:38.484
<i>best daiquiris on the planet.</i>

50:38.552 --> 50:40.420
<i>And the men are gorgeous.</i>

50:45.225 --> 50:46.292
Got it.

50:46.359 --> 50:48.428
What?
Show it to me.

50:49.730 --> 50:51.631
Here it is.

51:05.212 --> 51:07.614
Oh, my God.

51:10.851 --> 51:13.318
Allison.
