02:41.292 --> 02:42.084
Yes.

02:42.126 --> 02:44.084
<i>Frank, where are you?</i>

02:44.209 --> 02:45.542
On my way. Why?

02:45.667 --> 02:46.667
<i>Why!?</i>

02:47.167 --> 02:48.917
<i>Did you see how
many times I tried to call?</i>

02:49.084 --> 02:49.834
Now, yes!

02:49.959 --> 02:50.959
Sorry,

02:51.042 --> 02:53.126
didn't hear the phone.

02:54.626 --> 02:55.334
Have...

02:55.626 --> 02:57.209
Have you left yet?

03:00.959 --> 03:02.459
Are you still there?

03:02.834 --> 03:04.126
Yes.

03:04.709 --> 03:07.334
<i>I'm asking myself if I really
should bring her to you at all.</i>

03:07.417 --> 03:09.417
I can handle this.

03:10.334 --> 03:12.334
<i>I hope so, for your sake, Frank.</i>

03:13.084 --> 03:15.126
<i>Even more so for Lily's.</i>

03:15.376 --> 03:17.876
<i>But if you screw up again your weekend...</i>

03:18.001 --> 03:21.001
<i>then there won't be a next time.</i>

03:21.917 --> 03:23.334
Got it.

03:25.209 --> 03:26.876
<i>All right then...</i>

03:27.042 --> 03:28.334
See you later.

05:37.917 --> 05:41.084
Hmm rough night huh?

05:41.417 --> 05:43.042
That would be news to me.

05:43.126 --> 05:45.126
These and number four.

05:49.959 --> 05:51.292
These, too.

05:57.376 --> 05:58.626
Something for you?

05:58.709 --> 05:59.709
No,

05:59.792 --> 06:02.001
she's too old for that.

06:14.042 --> 06:15.792
Just get on with it.

06:39.084 --> 06:40.251
Need a light?

06:44.042 --> 06:44.876
No.

06:45.042 --> 06:46.959
Ah. Okay,

06:50.917 --> 06:52.167
Can I help you with something?

06:52.251 --> 06:54.167
I just wanted to ask where you're headed.

06:55.001 --> 06:56.001
Why?

06:56.334 --> 06:58.959
My ride didn't show.

06:59.876 --> 07:00.959
Mm...

07:01.834 --> 07:03.209
Where do you need to go?

07:04.042 --> 07:05.001
Berlin.

07:14.334 --> 07:16.001
Sure whatever.

07:16.459 --> 07:18.334
Seriously?

07:18.834 --> 07:20.167
Yeah, why not...

07:21.292 --> 07:22.584
Just to make things clear,

07:22.667 --> 07:24.834
I like loud music and
I'm not in the mood for chit-chat.

07:24.917 --> 07:25.834
Is that a problem?

07:25.834 --> 07:27.959
No problem at all.

07:28.292 --> 07:29.792
And thank you.

07:37.001 --> 07:39.251
The trunk is full. Give me that.

07:45.501 --> 07:48.251
That's very kind of you, Frank.

07:50.084 --> 07:51.126
Have we met?

07:51.209 --> 07:52.167
No,

07:52.584 --> 07:54.334
but I can read.

08:02.959 --> 08:04.334
Andreas.

08:06.292 --> 08:08.126
Seatbelt.

09:35.251 --> 09:38.251
Crazy, how many people seem to
drive with a death wish.

09:42.334 --> 09:44.334
There goes another one!

09:51.334 --> 09:54.334
One mistake and it all could be over.

09:56.001 --> 09:58.334
A little distracted,

09:58.876 --> 09:59.917
showing off.

10:00.001 --> 10:02.501
Maybe even a little bit tipsy.

10:02.834 --> 10:04.042
Game over.

10:09.209 --> 10:12.167
Tchah, there's your next candidate.

10:13.792 --> 10:15.834
Nice car, though.

10:22.126 --> 10:24.001
Nowadays it's much safer.

10:24.084 --> 10:27.126
Airbags front, side and back.

10:31.209 --> 10:34.084
It helps if you know how to drive!

10:34.959 --> 10:36.334
I guess.

11:29.251 --> 11:33.251
Lots of people even drive after
the disco. That's asking for it.

11:33.834 --> 11:37.834
Suddenly, it's not only your life
that's at stake, it's your passenger's too.

11:43.292 --> 11:45.292
Sorry, I don't mean to bug you, but...

11:47.876 --> 11:49.959
Honestly, I've...

11:58.876 --> 12:00.084
Don't move!

12:00.751 --> 12:01.917
Don't move!

12:33.167 --> 12:34.292
The backpack!

12:34.501 --> 12:37.084
Is that a RCD or a VOD!?

12:37.167 --> 12:38.667
My hose!

12:38.751 --> 12:39.917
Are you crazy!?

12:40.001 --> 12:41.042
RCD or VOD!?

12:41.126 --> 12:42.834
I can't breathe.

12:44.626 --> 12:46.251
I am only going to ask you one more time.

12:46.459 --> 12:47.792
RCD or VOD!?

12:47.876 --> 12:49.334
I don't know what you're talking about!

12:58.626 --> 13:00.167
My nose...

13:03.167 --> 13:04.959
What was that all about?

13:05.584 --> 13:07.792
Were you trying to suffocate me?

13:10.917 --> 13:12.959
I still need that lift to Berlin.

13:21.751 --> 13:22.876
Wait, wait, wait...

13:22.876 --> 13:24.834
Get in on this side.

13:26.834 --> 13:28.126
Come on.

14:29.001 --> 14:30.417
Hey...

14:31.334 --> 14:33.334
it might be broken I think.

14:34.126 --> 14:35.834
Yeah!

14:40.042 --> 14:42.084
Well, maybe it isn't.

14:59.334 --> 15:02.334
I'll shoot your balls off, if necessary.

15:03.917 --> 15:06.709
Stay calm, get me to Berlin,
and everything will be fine.

15:27.209 --> 15:28.292
Did you see that?

15:28.501 --> 15:30.751
We'll make a brief stop there.

15:32.251 --> 15:35.209
All right. One milkshake, vanilla, large.

15:35.584 --> 15:39.334
And one Waffle Beast
with chocolate sauce.

15:40.834 --> 15:42.834
Will there be anything else?

15:43.542 --> 15:45.209
What kind of burger do you want?

15:45.292 --> 15:46.334
Nothing.

15:46.542 --> 15:48.834
Ooh come on. Tell me.

15:49.042 --> 15:50.334
I just did.

15:51.042 --> 15:52.334
Some fries...

15:53.251 --> 15:54.626
Come on now.

15:57.084 --> 15:58.084
Any Burger.

15:58.334 --> 15:59.834
Any Burger?

16:00.001 --> 16:03.001
Any Burger doesn't exist, does it?

16:04.417 --> 16:05.917
Big Beast.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.126
Okay, that's...

16:09.209 --> 16:12.209
And some ice cubes in an extra cup.

16:13.334 --> 16:15.917
That makes one Icy Beast...

16:16.251 --> 16:19.459
Oh sorry, I mean one Waffle
Beast with chocolate sauce,

16:19.584 --> 16:22.084
one vanilla shake large,

16:22.167 --> 16:25.292
medium fries and one Big Beast.

16:25.667 --> 16:26.834
And...

16:27.167 --> 16:29.959
some ice cubes in an extra cup.

16:30.001 --> 16:31.792
Make that a menu.

16:33.417 --> 16:34.792
Er...

16:35.167 --> 16:37.709
those are all single items.

16:37.959 --> 16:38.667
If you add...

16:38.709 --> 16:40.834
How is it single?

16:41.584 --> 16:47.084
Fries, Big Beast, Beverage. I mean...
sounds exactly like a menu to me.

16:48.209 --> 16:49.209
What!

16:49.792 --> 16:51.209
Hey just make it a menu!

16:51.292 --> 16:52.251
But a shake doesn't...

16:52.501 --> 16:54.417
Do you even speak my language!?

16:54.751 --> 16:55.667
I think so...

16:55.876 --> 16:57.417
Well, then what's the fucking problem!?

16:57.501 --> 16:58.709
One extra cola then.

16:58.792 --> 17:00.751
With the menu, please.

17:00.834 --> 17:02.084
All right.

17:04.126 --> 17:06.751
I need a menu with... er... No. Fries.

17:06.834 --> 17:07.501
It's on me.

17:07.584 --> 17:12.834
Vanilla milkshake large and er...

17:23.291 --> 17:25.084
No first aid kit?

17:27.041 --> 17:28.709
What's in the bag?

17:28.792 --> 17:30.209
Clothes.

17:30.667 --> 17:31.709
Open it.

17:31.792 --> 17:33.876
I told you, it's just clothes.

17:35.042 --> 17:37.084
Open it. Now.

18:05.417 --> 18:06.792
Perfect.

18:09.584 --> 18:12.584
And now tie it up nice and tight.

18:22.084 --> 18:23.834
Careful now.

18:32.917 --> 18:34.167
Thanks.

18:34.584 --> 18:36.167
Get in.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.792
Eat otherwise It will get cold.

19:24.667 --> 19:28.334
For once I'm buying and
now you don't want any?

19:31.959 --> 19:33.334
Eat.

19:45.126 --> 19:48.126
I don't want you to faint on me.

19:53.334 --> 19:55.209
It's amazing.

19:56.834 --> 20:01.501
Somewhere at the end of the
world there's a giant sugar plantation.

20:01.626 --> 20:03.584
A cucumber monoculture here,

20:03.667 --> 20:05.209
tomato factory there.

20:05.292 --> 20:07.667
Cattle as far as the eye can see.

20:07.751 --> 20:09.209
Mix it all up

20:09.667 --> 20:11.334
Ta-da!

20:11.876 --> 20:13.917
A Burger.

20:15.917 --> 20:18.917
Exactly the same, everywhere.

20:22.917 --> 20:25.084
It's quite tasty actually.

20:30.001 --> 20:33.001
Nothing to to with real food though.

20:38.126 --> 20:40.001
No, no. Eat up.

20:52.834 --> 20:57.501
You should wipe your mouth.
You're oozing quite a bit of ketchup there!

21:02.334 --> 21:05.334
Always the same, same taste,

21:06.042 --> 21:07.959
consistency too.

21:08.042 --> 21:11.417
And before you know it, the whole
world speaks American. Crazy right?

21:11.542 --> 21:14.834
You know, there is a thing
called the Big-Boss-Index.

21:15.334 --> 21:18.959
It determines how much a
Big Boss should cost in comparison

21:19.167 --> 21:20.834
to the cost of living
in any given country.

21:20.917 --> 21:21.917
What are you going to do with the bomb?

21:22.001 --> 21:24.417
No, not the cost of living er, the...

21:24.501 --> 21:26.167
What are you going to do with the bomb?

21:26.292 --> 21:28.292
The purchasing power.

21:41.126 --> 21:43.126
Slow down... Now!

21:44.834 --> 21:48.001
You are making a huge mistake.
Slow down, goddamn idiot!

21:48.167 --> 21:48.876
Do what you want.

21:48.959 --> 21:49.959
Slow down!

21:50.001 --> 21:52.001
I'll crash us into the next tree.

21:52.084 --> 21:54.084
I don't give a shit.

21:57.084 --> 21:58.584
I'll do it.

21:58.834 --> 22:00.376
This is what's going to happen.

22:00.459 --> 22:04.917
You stay calm and do as I tell you,
then this won't end badly.

22:05.042 --> 22:06.667
Understood?

22:06.834 --> 22:09.667
This is on you, Frank. Only you.

22:16.501 --> 22:19.126
No bullshit now. Keep your
hands where they are.

22:20.084 --> 22:21.917
Just stay calm.

22:22.042 --> 22:23.167
Don't try anything.

22:23.501 --> 22:24.917
Wrong, Frank.

22:25.084 --> 22:26.792
It's already happening.

22:26.876 --> 22:28.709
At this very moment.

22:30.209 --> 22:32.709
The only question to remain
is what will happen to whom.

22:32.876 --> 22:36.667
To me. To you. To those puppets.

22:37.959 --> 22:39.959
Or to Lily.

22:42.209 --> 22:43.626
Hey!

22:45.709 --> 22:47.042
Stay calm.

22:47.209 --> 22:49.126
Nothing is decided yet.

22:51.001 --> 22:53.001
Think about Lily.

22:59.751 --> 23:01.917
That was really good.

23:02.042 --> 23:05.876
I'll take that. I'll take...
three... then you can...

23:06.042 --> 23:08.917
Do you want to roll again? Again.

23:09.084 --> 23:12.084
I'll take the two little mice...

23:15.459 --> 23:17.459
Listen carefully.

23:18.292 --> 23:19.751
Listen!

23:20.459 --> 23:23.084
This is what's going to happen.

23:23.959 --> 23:26.501
If I don't check in,

23:26.751 --> 23:29.751
there is nothing I can do
for your little girl.

23:31.501 --> 23:32.834
Those two.

23:33.084 --> 23:34.209
If they don't leave,

23:34.709 --> 23:36.126
they need to go.

23:36.792 --> 23:38.667
Understood?

23:44.167 --> 23:46.917
Have I made myself clear?

23:54.959 --> 23:57.501
This is on you Frank.

23:59.792 --> 24:02.709
I told you not to fuck around.

24:04.917 --> 24:07.917
I only ever wanted to get to Berlin.

24:19.292 --> 24:20.709
Nice car.

24:22.126 --> 24:23.709
License and registration, please.

24:23.792 --> 24:25.626
All here.

24:29.042 --> 24:30.626
Thanks.

24:36.084 --> 24:38.959
You have had your license
for 19 years now.

24:40.126 --> 24:42.834
Can you tell me why you had to
accelerate so hastily back there?

24:43.042 --> 24:47.376
And why you crossed those road
markings without any apparent reason?

24:49.709 --> 24:51.751
What was that all about?

24:52.084 --> 24:55.084
I have to get to
the train station in Berlin.

24:55.167 --> 24:58.084
My wife, my soon-to-be-ex-wife is
bringing our daughter over for Christmas.

24:58.167 --> 25:02.167
It's the first time she'll
stay with me for a while longer.

25:04.042 --> 25:05.959
And because of that, you think
you can drive anyway you like?

25:06.251 --> 25:08.084
No. Of course not. You're right.

25:08.542 --> 25:12.751
I'm just nervous and can't be late.

25:13.251 --> 25:13.917
Ok...

25:14.792 --> 25:15.959
and your co-driver?

25:16.626 --> 25:18.751
Is your friend going to pick up
your wife as well?

25:18.876 --> 25:21.834
This is Alex. He always comes along.

25:24.667 --> 25:26.334
Mister Balzer, have you
had anything to drink?

25:26.459 --> 25:27.084
No.

25:27.376 --> 25:29.042
Other substances?

25:29.126 --> 25:29.792
No.

25:29.876 --> 25:31.209
Sure?

25:31.709 --> 25:33.709
I just want to get to Berlin
and to my daughter.

25:34.334 --> 25:37.084
Could you please just let us go?
Nothing has happened.

25:37.209 --> 25:38.792
Would you please step out of the car.

25:39.209 --> 25:40.917
Your friend Alex can stay in the car.

25:41.042 --> 25:42.667
Why?

25:43.126 --> 25:45.376
Can't you just write me up
and send me the ticket?

25:45.459 --> 25:47.459
Step out!

25:47.917 --> 25:50.417
I'll have to call in soon, Frank.

25:50.501 --> 25:52.501
Think about Lily.

25:58.209 --> 25:59.042
You don't understand.

25:59.126 --> 25:59.709
Mister Balzer!

25:59.834 --> 26:02.834
I can't be late or they'll
take away my visiting rights.

26:03.084 --> 26:04.626
I am really sorry about that.

26:04.709 --> 26:07.709
But that has nothing to do
with the issue at hand.

26:07.834 --> 26:10.709
At the moment I'm only interested
in whether you've been drinking or not,

26:10.834 --> 26:14.084
or if you have anything more
to say concerning our situation here.

26:14.251 --> 26:15.001
No.

26:15.376 --> 26:15.959
Good.

26:16.251 --> 26:18.292
Then you won't object
to a breathalyzer test.

26:18.376 --> 26:21.251
And I would like to check your car.

26:21.376 --> 26:22.542
That's not possible.

26:22.709 --> 26:23.959
Excuse me?

26:24.209 --> 26:25.751
Just walk away.

26:25.876 --> 26:27.001
Ok, that's enough.

26:27.084 --> 26:29.501
Turn around and put
your hands on the car.

26:29.626 --> 26:32.792
Hey! What will it be? This or them?

26:32.917 --> 26:34.459
Get back into the vehicle now!

26:34.542 --> 26:35.126
Back into the vehicle!

26:35.209 --> 26:37.126
I said turn around!

26:37.251 --> 26:38.292
Hey!

26:45.959 --> 26:46.917
Put the gun down!

26:47.001 --> 26:48.209
Now!

27:15.626 --> 27:17.709
Where are the keys?

27:19.876 --> 27:21.667
Are you crazy? We need to go.

27:21.792 --> 27:24.792
Wrong. We agreed that they have to go.

27:36.584 --> 27:39.834
Ah. You're one of those!

27:45.542 --> 27:47.542
Okay.

27:49.209 --> 27:51.209
No! No!

29:13.126 --> 29:15.126
There you go.

29:18.042 --> 29:20.959
Pull shit like that again,
even just once,

29:21.334 --> 29:24.001
and your fucking whore
daughter is history.

29:24.209 --> 29:26.001
Do you understand me!?

29:26.292 --> 29:29.042
Do you finally understand me!?

29:34.751 --> 29:36.792
Yes.

29:42.376 --> 29:45.376
Come on, give me a hand.

29:49.584 --> 29:51.209
Come on...

30:23.834 --> 30:26.709
Get in, I will be right there.

31:58.751 --> 32:02.209
"It helps if you know how to drive!"

32:02.292 --> 32:04.667
Isn't that what you said?

32:19.584 --> 32:22.584
Look, they're waving at us.

34:27.751 --> 34:30.751
Ah, ah, ah. Give me that.

34:49.958 --> 34:51.958
What has any of this got
to do with my daughter?

34:52.042 --> 34:53.542
What?

34:54.833 --> 34:56.833
Why my daughter? Why!?

34:56.917 --> 34:59.917
What do you want from us!?

35:02.292 --> 35:05.292
Keep your calm, soldier!

35:16.501 --> 35:17.834
That's better.

35:19.959 --> 35:22.959
Some people don't know discipline.

35:25.126 --> 35:28.126
Or they lost it along the way.

35:33.042 --> 35:35.042
Speaking of...

35:40.959 --> 35:43.501
There are those who lead
and those who follow.

35:43.626 --> 35:46.626
Command and obedience.

35:47.876 --> 35:50.667
Some people just don't know their place.

35:50.751 --> 35:52.084
Can you help me?

35:52.167 --> 35:54.792
Mm... let me see,

35:54.917 --> 35:56.917
it's pretty tight, right?

35:57.084 --> 35:59.084
Mm...

36:02.334 --> 36:04.917
Strange juice you got there, Frank.

36:05.001 --> 36:06.126
Are you excited?

36:06.209 --> 36:07.501
We will be there soon.

36:07.584 --> 36:08.126
Yes.

36:08.251 --> 36:10.126
Not even sticky really.

36:10.834 --> 36:12.876
What are you looking forward to most?

36:12.959 --> 36:14.959
Daddy.

36:18.917 --> 36:20.709
Why me?

36:21.584 --> 36:23.042
Why?

36:24.626 --> 36:27.584
Because you're a good father, Frank.

36:27.709 --> 36:30.709
You just don't know it yet.

37:09.417 --> 37:12.334
Do you know why the
road is so bendy here?

37:12.459 --> 37:14.709
No.

37:14.834 --> 37:17.876
Because nobody is able
to drive straight anymore.

37:18.001 --> 37:19.292
Given the chance,

37:19.376 --> 37:21.251
people drive themselves to death.

37:21.376 --> 37:23.376
Like before.

37:25.001 --> 37:28.626
One cross, two cross, ten cross...

37:30.959 --> 37:32.667
Nothing.

37:33.959 --> 37:37.959
You have to slow them down.
And how does one do that?

37:43.626 --> 37:45.626
Huh?

37:46.709 --> 37:47.959
With curves.

37:48.042 --> 37:50.501
Bingelingeling! Frank!

37:50.626 --> 37:53.626
You do know how to play.

37:54.126 --> 37:57.917
Someone who's focusing on a
curve automatically slows down

37:58.042 --> 38:00.751
and reaches his destination regardless.

38:00.917 --> 38:02.959
The right distraction at the right time.

38:07.084 --> 38:09.709
Believe it or not, Frank.

38:09.876 --> 38:11.917
Humans are like sheep,

38:12.042 --> 38:14.417
they need a shepherd.

38:15.084 --> 38:16.917
And the city?

38:17.084 --> 38:18.959
What would the city be then, huh?

38:19.042 --> 38:20.959
I don't give a shit.

38:21.959 --> 38:23.751
The pasture.

38:23.917 --> 38:26.334
The wasteland lies behind them.

38:26.459 --> 38:28.709
Now they have to follow to the rules.

38:28.876 --> 38:31.834
The accumulation of knowledge
and culture in a powerful city.

38:31.959 --> 38:33.917
That's the way it should be.

38:34.292 --> 38:35.709
And what do we see?

38:37.376 --> 38:40.084
No more culture, no more greatness.

38:40.417 --> 38:42.834
The degenerates,
the unguided are in power.

38:42.959 --> 38:47.084
Piss against the walls
like dogs. It's disgusting.

38:48.209 --> 38:51.792
There they can spend themselves stupid.

38:51.959 --> 38:56.542
Another piece of junk for the pigsty.
Nice and cheap. Fattening up nicely.

39:00.501 --> 39:03.501
The time to shear has come.

39:06.709 --> 39:07.292
There!

39:07.376 --> 39:10.376
Snap your finger one
more time and I will rip it off.

39:21.959 --> 39:23.709
Next exit.

40:03.251 --> 40:05.917
I know you don't want to hear it, Frank,

40:06.084 --> 40:10.084
but we are all just tiny
cogs in a game of machines.

40:10.417 --> 40:12.417
You too, Frank.

40:13.126 --> 40:15.251
Especially you.

40:48.042 --> 40:49.959
Hello?

40:50.084 --> 40:52.209
It's me. Listen, we're running late.

40:52.292 --> 40:55.084
About an hour or so, something
to do with the railway switches.

40:55.209 --> 40:58.209
My reception is really bad.

40:59.417 --> 41:01.459
Are you all right?

41:01.584 --> 41:03.584
Yes...

41:04.084 --> 41:06.501
Is everything ok with you?

41:06.709 --> 41:07.751
Yes, yes of course.

41:08.042 --> 41:10.042
Okay see you soon.

41:10.167 --> 41:11.751
Hold on.

41:12.084 --> 41:14.709
Could you please
put Lily on for a second?

41:14.917 --> 41:16.917
Wait one moment.

41:20.834 --> 41:22.876
Oh she just went to the bathroom Frank.

41:23.001 --> 41:24.709
I see...

41:24.792 --> 41:27.792
We'll be there before you know it.

41:28.001 --> 41:29.709
Talk later.

41:31.084 --> 41:32.709
See you.

41:34.709 --> 41:36.292
Well that's good.

41:36.376 --> 41:39.084
No need to hurry then.

41:49.001 --> 41:52.001
You know how kids are.

41:52.959 --> 41:55.959
Don't worry about it, Frank.

42:04.959 --> 42:07.709
Let's stop over there.

42:17.042 --> 42:18.709
We're in Berlin.

42:18.834 --> 42:20.209
Can I go now?

42:20.792 --> 42:22.792
Relax.

42:23.167 --> 42:25.667
What else do you want from me?

42:26.792 --> 42:28.584
I owe you some juice.

42:28.709 --> 42:31.709
You don't look good at all.

42:39.209 --> 42:43.042
And ask for some paracetamol
or something similar.

42:53.917 --> 42:56.584
If we don't screw up again

42:56.709 --> 42:59.709
you can soon hold
little Lily in your arms.

43:00.584 --> 43:03.584
Just like you were supposed to.

43:43.167 --> 43:44.876
Hi there.

44:11.251 --> 44:13.042
Are you alright, brother?

44:13.334 --> 44:16.209
Do you have any painkillers?

44:17.459 --> 44:19.626
I'll go check.

45:08.917 --> 45:10.709
Here you go.

45:11.209 --> 45:13.042
Painkillers.

45:13.501 --> 45:15.292
You want some chai?

45:21.001 --> 45:23.084
What do I owe you?

45:27.376 --> 45:29.126
God...

45:29.709 --> 45:32.001
This fucking till...

45:34.792 --> 45:37.209
That's 6,50. These are on me.

45:37.834 --> 45:39.917
Keep the change.

45:40.042 --> 45:43.042
Why, brother? That's too much.

45:50.792 --> 45:52.001
Ay!

45:55.251 --> 45:57.834
You forgot something.

45:57.959 --> 46:01.042
I won't need them after all.

46:05.584 --> 46:07.084
We walk. You carry.

46:07.209 --> 46:08.584
You can get your car later.

46:08.667 --> 46:09.792
What's going on?

46:09.834 --> 46:11.834
What's going om?

46:42.834 --> 46:44.626
You lied to me.

46:57.459 --> 46:59.459
Andreas...

47:01.542 --> 47:03.709
You said 'take me to Berlin.'

47:04.834 --> 47:07.501
You said 'take me to Berlin
and everything is going to be all right!'

47:07.626 --> 47:08.834
Yes.

47:21.209 --> 47:23.167
Where were we?

47:25.334 --> 47:27.709
I told you to get me
to Berlin and that was it.

47:27.834 --> 47:29.292
You had to brake.

47:29.376 --> 47:30.167
You!

47:30.251 --> 47:31.709
Those two cops.

47:31.834 --> 47:33.834
You!

47:34.042 --> 47:37.001
The only thing that someone like
you should do is obey.

47:40.834 --> 47:42.709
Speaking of...

47:42.876 --> 47:45.501
What ever happened to those painkillers?

47:46.876 --> 47:48.834
Didn't have any.

48:28.709 --> 48:30.834
Baa, Frank,

48:30.959 --> 48:32.959
Baa-a...

48:39.667 --> 48:42.126
You're pathetic.

48:44.001 --> 48:45.917
Me?

48:47.126 --> 48:49.376
I am pathetic?

48:56.667 --> 48:59.667
Who do you think you are?

48:59.792 --> 49:03.751
Do you really think this
will round up your sheep?

49:05.167 --> 49:06.834
Do you really believe that?

49:06.876 --> 49:08.792
It doesn't matter what kind
of shit you got planned here,

49:08.834 --> 49:10.126
the people will hate you for it.

49:10.251 --> 49:12.251
They'll hate your guts!

49:12.376 --> 49:14.167
I sure hope so.

49:16.376 --> 49:19.042
Nothing of this makes any sense.

49:20.834 --> 49:22.167
Andreas,

49:22.209 --> 49:24.501
please let me go.

49:25.626 --> 49:28.667
Please let us go.

49:30.167 --> 49:32.126
Move!

49:34.751 --> 49:37.751
And put that thing out. It's disgusting.

50:10.459 --> 50:13.459
At least keep my family out of this.

51:01.501 --> 51:04.417
Leave the backpack
and put these clothes on.

51:04.542 --> 51:06.542
Boots, too.

51:17.792 --> 51:20.792
Move. We don't have all day.

51:36.792 --> 51:38.834
Get on with it!

52:26.542 --> 52:28.709
You stupid pig.

52:39.292 --> 52:41.834
That's it Frank.

52:43.251 --> 52:45.251
That's it.

52:47.792 --> 52:50.792
You've really done it now.

53:11.917 --> 53:14.917
I feel really sorry for
your daughter, Frank.

53:17.584 --> 53:18.001
Hello.

53:18.042 --> 53:19.251
Hello?

53:19.334 --> 53:20.959
Yes it's me.

53:22.209 --> 53:24.001
Zero. Four.

53:24.209 --> 53:25.501
Not...

53:25.584 --> 53:26.667
Not...

53:26.709 --> 53:28.751
Not my daughter.

53:32.001 --> 53:32.834
I'll do...

53:32.917 --> 53:35.042
I'll do anything.

53:35.167 --> 53:37.876
Please not my daughter.

53:37.959 --> 53:39.959
Please.

53:44.042 --> 53:46.917
This is your last chance, Frank.

53:49.084 --> 53:52.084
But only because I really like you.

55:20.501 --> 55:21.751
Forget the boots.

55:21.834 --> 55:23.917
Get over here!

56:02.917 --> 56:05.459
Brothers it is time to fight -

56:05.584 --> 56:07.917
Allah is the light-

56:08.042 --> 56:10.417
And we shall not falter -

56:10.542 --> 56:13.084
Allah is salvation -

56:13.292 --> 56:15.501
Once there was a kafir -

56:15.626 --> 56:17.876
He travelled afar to kill -

56:17.959 --> 56:20.042
Thoughts of leaving his guilt behind -

56:20.209 --> 56:22.334
But he has finally gone too far -

56:23.459 --> 56:25.917
To war, my brothers -

56:26.084 --> 56:28.417
Draw your blades -

56:28.626 --> 56:30.626
Steel your hearts and your arms -

56:30.709 --> 56:33.709
Allah will call on the best -

56:34.709 --> 56:37.792
Kafir, kafir, got to die -

56:37.917 --> 56:40.084
You know why, you know why -

56:40.209 --> 56:42.834
You thought you could murder brothers -

56:42.959 --> 56:45.917
You thought wrong,

56:46.042 --> 56:48.917
Punishment is upon you -

56:49.292 --> 56:52.001
We rise against the kafir pests -

56:52.126 --> 56:54.667
And burn down their cosy nests -

56:54.834 --> 56:57.251
Till the last kafir devil -

56:58.459 --> 57:01.459
Pays with his blood -

57:33.292 --> 57:34.834
Brothers,

57:35.084 --> 57:38.084
we have ourselves a special kafir here.

57:41.167 --> 57:45.167
A true servant of the devil
and the western infidels.

57:47.542 --> 57:48.709
He was...

57:49.001 --> 57:52.167
Not in the dark about his deeds,

57:52.292 --> 57:55.292
nor had anybody forced his hand.

57:55.459 --> 57:57.709
He has chosen evil by his own accord.

57:57.876 --> 57:59.626
He is a volunteer!

57:59.709 --> 58:02.709
A true crusader.

58:03.084 --> 58:05.709
Face forward, infidel.

58:05.917 --> 58:08.876
Face your judges!

58:10.376 --> 58:13.209
Frank Balzer is kneeling before you,

58:13.376 --> 58:17.792
born on the 4th of December 1979
in Fürstenwalde, Germany.

58:17.876 --> 58:20.584
First sergeant of the German
Special Aerial Reconnaissance

58:20.626 --> 58:23.501
Company 260 in Seedorf.

58:23.709 --> 58:28.459
This is where this kafir has
acquired the tools of his foul trade -

58:28.584 --> 58:31.584
cursed may he be.

58:32.917 --> 58:34.251
All this...

58:34.376 --> 58:37.459
was paid for with the blood
of our brothers and sisters.

58:37.584 --> 58:39.084
Murderer in the holy land

58:39.126 --> 58:41.542
and family man at home.

58:41.667 --> 58:43.626
That is the way of the West.

58:43.667 --> 58:45.376
A criminal and drunkard,

58:45.501 --> 58:47.417
who cheats on his own wife,

58:47.542 --> 58:51.542
while deceitfully murdering
children in foreign countries.

58:55.042 --> 58:57.501
Now you may turn around, kafir.

58:57.626 --> 58:59.209
Look at what you have done.

58:59.334 --> 59:01.334
Look.

59:08.417 --> 59:11.584
Now you look away, huh?

59:11.751 --> 59:13.376
But we don't.

59:13.501 --> 59:17.126
Because no one can
escape Allah's judgment

59:17.292 --> 59:19.459
and we will fulfill his holy bidding.

59:19.542 --> 59:21.917
(God willing)

59:27.167 --> 59:29.042
Tell us what you have done.

59:29.334 --> 59:32.334
Bear witness!

59:37.167 --> 59:38.667
I've got nothing to say.

59:38.917 --> 59:41.042
Yes, you do. You do, kafir scum!

59:41.167 --> 59:45.167
What happened on June 19th, 2011?

59:52.126 --> 59:56.126
I don't know what you are talking about.

59:56.751 --> 59:59.876
I am talking about the night in
which good Muslims lost their children.

59:59.959 --> 01:00:02.542
In which mothers cried
out their pain to the almighty.

01:00:02.667 --> 01:00:05.084
(the vulnerable Muslims)

01:00:05.376 --> 01:00:08.209
Cowardly burned them from afar,

01:00:17.376 --> 01:00:18.084
The insurgents had...

01:00:18.209 --> 01:00:21.209
First state your name, clearly.
And face forward.

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:32.792
What have you done, you infidel?

01:00:39.084 --> 01:00:41.084
Done?

01:00:42.084 --> 01:00:45.042
Yes, what have you done?

01:00:54.209 --> 01:00:56.001
I fulfilled my mission.

01:00:56.126 --> 01:00:57.751
That's what I did.

01:00:57.876 --> 01:01:00.584
And what was your, so called, mission?

01:01:02.042 --> 01:01:05.876
Observation in the greater area
of Kunduz, as part of the Task Force 51.

01:01:06.001 --> 01:01:08.584
What is that supposed to mean?

01:01:10.167 --> 01:01:14.834
In June it gets really hot in Afghanistan,
at least in the greater area of Kunduz.

01:01:15.001 --> 01:01:19.001
Forty degrees Celsius, maybe more.
It's all right in camp, but outside -

01:01:30.751 --> 01:01:33.084
It started in April.

01:01:33.542 --> 01:01:36.917
Constant heavy attacks on
the camp and the allied hajis.

01:01:37.167 --> 01:01:39.209
The first to be injured in May...

01:01:39.709 --> 01:01:40.209
well...

01:01:40.334 --> 01:01:42.792
the first on our side
- injured Germans.

01:01:42.876 --> 01:01:44.667
Continue.

01:01:44.876 --> 01:01:48.876
If you've never seen combat,
you've no idea what it actually means.

01:01:49.001 --> 01:01:51.126
None of you get it.

01:01:51.292 --> 01:01:52.126
Fuck you!

01:01:52.251 --> 01:01:54.042
Fuck all of you!

01:01:54.126 --> 01:01:57.709
We have no business in that country.

01:01:57.876 --> 01:01:59.501
None!

01:01:59.667 --> 01:02:02.667
That has nothing to do with Europe.

01:02:04.042 --> 01:02:06.792
You're treating what's left of some
poor bastards in the camp hospital,

01:02:06.959 --> 01:02:10.667
guys that were injured in the
midst of collateral damage,

01:02:10.834 --> 01:02:13.167
and the village elder is
sitting in front of you,

01:02:13.334 --> 01:02:16.126
a greedy old man, no teeth and

01:02:16.292 --> 01:02:19.209
all he's interested in
is how much he can make

01:02:19.376 --> 01:02:22.876
off his dying nephew,
son, brother - whatever.

01:02:24.209 --> 01:02:27.084
Daughter's head got shot off?

01:02:27.417 --> 01:02:30.417
It's worse if a cow dies of thirst.

01:02:33.959 --> 01:02:35.584
If you go to this
shitty country, you either go

01:02:35.667 --> 01:02:37.667
with three divisions
or you don't go at all.

01:02:37.959 --> 01:02:39.959
The night of June 20th.

01:02:40.126 --> 01:02:42.876
Attacks on patrols again and again,

01:02:43.042 --> 01:02:45.792
RPG's hitting the camp every day,

01:02:45.959 --> 01:02:49.959
IED's on streets that were deemed
safe before Haji's summer holidays.

01:02:50.126 --> 01:02:53.126
And on June 12th things got messy.

01:02:54.501 --> 01:02:55.876
Boom!

01:02:56.001 --> 01:02:57.792
Two men dead, seven injured.

01:02:57.834 --> 01:02:59.042
Continue.

01:02:59.376 --> 01:03:00.792
Then we got the news.

01:03:00.959 --> 01:03:02.459
Several tankers, Pick-Ups,

01:03:02.626 --> 01:03:06.042
everything they needed for
an attack on the camp, hijacked, stolen...

01:03:06.209 --> 01:03:07.251
Obviously the hajis...

01:03:07.417 --> 01:03:09.501
no doubt about it.

01:03:09.667 --> 01:03:10.709
Then?

01:03:10.792 --> 01:03:11.917
What happened?

01:03:11.959 --> 01:03:14.459
We found them,

01:03:14.626 --> 01:03:16.376
in the mountains...

01:03:16.542 --> 01:03:19.542
All of it. Camouflaged...

01:03:20.084 --> 01:03:22.751
The TOC wanted confirmation...

01:03:22.792 --> 01:03:26.084
that there were
no civilians at the scene.

01:03:26.209 --> 01:03:27.251
And?

01:03:28.584 --> 01:03:30.667
I confirmed.

01:03:35.709 --> 01:03:39.709
It was high time for us to strike back.

01:03:40.126 --> 01:03:42.417
Otherwise the enemy
won't take us seriously.

01:03:42.667 --> 01:03:45.251
It's war out there, and wars are
not won by just building schools alone.

01:03:45.459 --> 01:03:46.209
Then what?

01:03:46.376 --> 01:03:48.251
What happened next?

01:03:48.417 --> 01:03:50.126
The Americans launched an air strike.

01:03:50.292 --> 01:03:52.709
We're not equipped like them.

01:03:52.876 --> 01:03:54.042
Two F15.

01:03:54.209 --> 01:03:54.917
Nice Eagles.

01:03:55.001 --> 01:03:57.667
You won't even see them, only hear them.

01:03:57.834 --> 01:03:59.292
Cleaned out the whole place.

01:03:59.376 --> 01:04:01.084
Now you may turn around and look.

01:04:01.209 --> 01:04:03.209
Look!

01:04:11.459 --> 01:04:13.542
This western crusader

01:04:13.709 --> 01:04:15.917
has burnt children and good Muslims.

01:04:16.167 --> 01:04:17.917
Not because he believes in a false god

01:04:18.042 --> 01:04:18.959
No!

01:04:19.084 --> 01:04:21.709
He doesn't believe in any god.

01:04:21.876 --> 01:04:24.876
I'm a soldier.

01:04:27.001 --> 01:04:30.834
You didn't even look at them,
the burnt children.

01:04:30.959 --> 01:04:32.917
Because you are a coward,

01:04:33.042 --> 01:04:36.626
a coward like all the clogs
of the West with their drones.

01:04:36.792 --> 01:04:38.876
That's war. Period.

01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:42.126
I fulfilled my mission.
I didn't give the order.

01:04:44.917 --> 01:04:46.834
This henchman of murderers,

01:04:46.917 --> 01:04:49.792
this man, who himself
has the heart of a murderer,

01:04:49.917 --> 01:04:53.667
today will bring the war
to where it belongs:

01:04:53.834 --> 01:04:56.834
his homeland.

01:04:59.751 --> 01:05:02.251
Frank Balzer will pay his debt.

01:05:02.417 --> 01:05:04.667
He will carry a bomb
to Berlin Central Station.

01:05:04.834 --> 01:05:06.917
He will give his pathetic life meaning,

01:05:07.042 --> 01:05:09.667
and for the infidels' most holy feast...

01:05:09.834 --> 01:05:12.334
the war will have
reached the heart of Europe.

01:05:12.501 --> 01:05:14.501
(In ch'allah!)

01:05:32.501 --> 01:05:35.501
That went rather well, don't you think?

01:05:56.292 --> 01:05:59.084
Can you drive?

01:06:08.709 --> 01:06:11.001
Here. Put that on.

01:06:11.126 --> 01:06:14.126
You're shivering.

01:06:15.167 --> 01:06:19.167
Who is supposed to believe this crap?

01:06:19.376 --> 01:06:21.584
People believe what
they want to believe, Frank.

01:06:21.751 --> 01:06:25.751
And unfortunately you
have to play your part.

01:06:32.876 --> 01:06:35.876
Are you alright?

01:06:41.292 --> 01:06:44.542
You tased my arse with 20k volts.

01:06:44.709 --> 01:06:46.751
Come on.

01:06:46.876 --> 01:06:48.876
Get over it.

01:06:57.542 --> 01:07:00.917
I'm sorry if I was a little
rough just now. I had to be.

01:07:01.084 --> 01:07:04.084
But you almost break my nose!

01:07:04.542 --> 01:07:06.292
Guess we're even then.

01:07:06.417 --> 01:07:08.001
Sure.

01:07:08.084 --> 01:07:09.584
Great.

01:07:09.709 --> 01:07:13.709
We'll finish this,
nice and orderly manner. Okay?

01:07:16.376 --> 01:07:17.251
No more bullshit.

01:07:17.417 --> 01:07:20.001
Just get us to Central Station.
Drop off the package.

01:07:20.126 --> 01:07:23.542
And your daughter can
celebrate Christmas with her mommy.

01:07:23.709 --> 01:07:25.001
You are insane.

01:07:25.126 --> 01:07:26.334
Wrong.

01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:28.542
It would be insane not to act.

01:07:28.667 --> 01:07:31.667
So get on with it.

01:07:32.417 --> 01:07:35.417
We can do this.

01:07:39.959 --> 01:07:40.917
Here.

01:07:41.042 --> 01:07:44.042
Guess it doesn't matter.

01:07:45.751 --> 01:07:48.751
They're in my jacket.

01:08:15.584 --> 01:08:17.501
Careful.

01:08:17.709 --> 01:08:20.709
Hold still now.

01:09:11.626 --> 01:09:14.626
France is lost already.

01:09:16.876 --> 01:09:18.792
The mussies are in charge now.

01:09:18.876 --> 01:09:23.792
Parading their AK's on
Champs Elyse every now and again.

01:09:24.042 --> 01:09:27.917
Why do you think why they have
the highest birthrate in all of Europe?

01:09:28.167 --> 01:09:31.209
Why do you think why so many
of these children are born retarded?

01:09:31.626 --> 01:09:33.751
Who is fat, stupid, lazy
and can't even walk straight...

01:09:33.876 --> 01:09:36.792
Who gets his arse wiped till they're eighteen
and still throws his weight around?

01:09:36.876 --> 01:09:38.209
Who?

01:09:42.251 --> 01:09:44.709
Who!?

01:09:44.876 --> 01:09:47.709
What do I know...

01:09:47.876 --> 01:09:50.876
Ramadan-brats.

01:09:52.792 --> 01:09:54.876
It has all been written
in Black and white.

01:09:55.042 --> 01:09:56.876
In a natural world, in a...

01:09:57.001 --> 01:10:00.334
good world, they wouldn't
even be able to survive.

01:10:00.917 --> 01:10:04.667
We force feed them in our civilization.

01:10:04.834 --> 01:10:06.251
That we have been forging
for a thousand years...

01:10:06.417 --> 01:10:09.417
A fucking thousand years!

01:10:10.251 --> 01:10:13.251
By the sweat of our brows.

01:10:18.917 --> 01:10:21.917
Tell me I'm wrong. Go on, tell me!

01:10:33.334 --> 01:10:36.876
It makes me want to throw up
seeing this misery every day.

01:10:37.042 --> 01:10:40.626
We've been walking around with our
heads bowed for the past seventy years.

01:10:40.751 --> 01:10:45.751
And the American Jew sets
the pace, with a nigger in office.

01:10:45.917 --> 01:10:47.792
That's just sick!

01:10:47.917 --> 01:10:50.917
So that's what you call sick?

01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:54.709
Come on, don't pretend.

01:10:54.876 --> 01:10:57.876
You feel it, too. Something's off.

01:10:58.209 --> 01:11:00.042
We're the fucking frog,

01:11:00.209 --> 01:11:02.626
sitting in a pot of water
that keeps getting hotter.

01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:03.959
And we don't even realize it.

01:11:04.126 --> 01:11:08.376
The poison of Islam is already
running through our veins,

01:11:08.542 --> 01:11:12.542
You got a whole different poison
running through your veins.

01:11:13.917 --> 01:11:15.917
Hmph... Yeah.

01:11:19.834 --> 01:11:22.584
That's what you think.

01:11:22.751 --> 01:11:25.667
But you'll see soon enough...

01:11:25.834 --> 01:11:26.876
Well.

01:11:26.959 --> 01:11:29.501
Not you, I guess...

01:11:59.876 --> 01:12:02.584
Believe me, that will soon be over.

01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:06.751
Then those lowlifes won't dare
to look a German in the eye.

01:12:08.084 --> 01:12:10.667
I mean, is that what's it come to?

01:12:10.834 --> 01:12:13.084
I have to kowtow in my own country?

01:12:13.167 --> 01:12:14.709
You have to kowtow...

01:12:14.834 --> 01:12:17.626
just because you're
proud of your heritage!?

01:12:17.792 --> 01:12:20.834
Show me one other country
like that. Just one, Frank!

01:12:21.001 --> 01:12:24.001
Simpletons at the pub must love you.

01:12:27.792 --> 01:12:29.792
Absolutely.

01:12:30.542 --> 01:12:33.542
And who is there with me in that pub?

01:12:38.167 --> 01:12:39.917
The ordinary guy,

01:12:40.042 --> 01:12:42.417
who is fed up with taking a beating...

01:12:42.584 --> 01:12:44.584
each time he says
what's wrong with this country.

01:12:44.667 --> 01:12:48.167
When he stands up for himself.

01:12:48.334 --> 01:12:50.042
And this little fella...

01:12:50.209 --> 01:12:51.417
is weak,

01:12:51.501 --> 01:12:52.626
weary,

01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:54.126
fast asleep.

01:12:54.417 --> 01:12:57.876
He wants to wake up,
but he can't do it on his own.

01:12:58.042 --> 01:13:00.042
He needs a spark of inspiration.

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:02.167
And you, Frank,

01:13:02.417 --> 01:13:05.667
you will have too ignite that spark.

01:13:05.834 --> 01:13:08.084
Believe me, these fucking
jackrabbits want to spread everywhere

01:13:08.251 --> 01:13:09.626
until we are extinct.

01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:10.834
That's what it's all about!

01:13:10.917 --> 01:13:12.584
The Arabs have a plan!

01:13:12.834 --> 01:13:14.001
If they could,

01:13:14.126 --> 01:13:15.501
they would...

01:13:15.709 --> 01:13:18.042
But we won't let him.

01:13:18.209 --> 01:13:21.001
We're just anticipating this attack!

01:13:21.042 --> 01:13:24.459
At a time when our race
still has enough power!

01:13:24.792 --> 01:13:26.792
To rise like a man!

01:13:26.959 --> 01:13:28.751
To fight back!

01:13:28.834 --> 01:13:30.709
To break our chains!

01:13:30.792 --> 01:13:33.792
To strike back!

01:13:44.001 --> 01:13:45.667
When even the most cool-headed German

01:13:45.709 --> 01:13:48.292
and the German
is stoic by nature

01:13:48.459 --> 01:13:49.834
finally realizes...

01:13:50.001 --> 01:13:52.876
What pest is polluting
the atmosphere in his country,

01:13:53.001 --> 01:13:55.001
lurking in the dark, waiting to fulfill

01:13:55.042 --> 01:13:57.459
their mullahs' and hatemongers' commands,

01:13:57.542 --> 01:13:58.834
then, my friend,

01:13:58.876 --> 01:14:01.292
these streets will burn.

01:14:01.667 --> 01:14:04.251
You know best what I'm talking about.

01:14:04.542 --> 01:14:07.542
I don't think so.

01:14:07.751 --> 01:14:08.959
Yes...

01:14:09.084 --> 01:14:10.959
You do!

01:14:11.126 --> 01:14:13.709
You of all people should be proud.

01:14:13.876 --> 01:14:14.834
Should I...?

01:14:14.876 --> 01:14:17.667
Yes! Yes!

01:14:17.834 --> 01:14:22.834
After all, you have burned
an entire village to ashes.

01:14:23.001 --> 01:14:26.001
You know nothing...

01:14:26.751 --> 01:14:28.042
Oh,

01:14:28.209 --> 01:14:30.376
but I do!

01:14:30.584 --> 01:14:33.584
To me you're a hero.

01:14:33.751 --> 01:14:36.876
And soon the people will rise. United.

01:14:37.042 --> 01:14:40.626
And once again there will be
a Germany we can be proud of.

01:14:40.792 --> 01:14:44.501
A Germany, that doesn't
kowtow to American finance.

01:14:44.709 --> 01:14:47.709
A Germany that spurns the
madness that promises we are all equal!

01:14:48.001 --> 01:14:49.251
It is our duty to wake the German people,

01:14:49.334 --> 01:14:53.501
to forge them together
in this hour of darkness.

01:14:54.042 --> 01:14:57.042
If we don't act today.

01:14:58.167 --> 01:15:01.167
Tomorrow, it will be too late.

01:15:17.751 --> 01:15:22.376
I know, many think this country is already
too intermingled, too diluted to rise up.

01:15:22.542 --> 01:15:24.251
Totally wrong.

01:15:24.959 --> 01:15:26.959
The plebeian, the arab-lovers,

01:15:27.126 --> 01:15:28.126
the do-gooders,

01:15:28.209 --> 01:15:30.459
until now have had the biggest mouths.

01:15:30.584 --> 01:15:33.584
But we will shut them up, Frank!

01:15:44.834 --> 01:15:47.126
Of course, it's hard, Frank.

01:15:48.209 --> 01:15:51.626
But rest assured that your sacrifice
will be for a higher, a greater cause.

01:15:51.876 --> 01:15:54.417
Not in vain in Afghanistan.

01:15:54.584 --> 01:15:56.834
But here at home,

01:15:56.959 --> 01:15:59.917
in your beloved country.

01:16:00.084 --> 01:16:03.084
Which we both love.

01:16:52.917 --> 01:16:55.709
You're going to be a martyr, Frank.

01:16:55.959 --> 01:16:58.876
For your daughter's future.

01:17:06.376 --> 01:17:09.376
You'll walk to the
Christmas tree over there.

01:17:09.709 --> 01:17:10.917
Just flip the switch.

01:17:11.042 --> 01:17:13.126
That's it.

01:17:20.834 --> 01:17:21.792
Here.

01:17:21.876 --> 01:17:24.876
In case you run out of courage.

01:17:32.584 --> 01:17:35.584
They're at Berlin
East Station now. It's time.

01:17:38.376 --> 01:17:39.709
The stream is still up if you...

01:17:39.792 --> 01:17:41.792
No.

01:17:42.417 --> 01:17:44.126
No.

01:17:46.084 --> 01:17:49.084
Listen to me Frank.

01:17:49.709 --> 01:17:52.917
I can assure you that
your daughter will be safe.

01:19:08.501 --> 01:19:11.501
Think about Lily.

01:20:00.209 --> 01:20:02.126
You made one mistake,

01:20:02.334 --> 01:20:05.209
you dirty piece of shit!

01:20:05.459 --> 01:20:07.292
I did not hide!

01:20:07.459 --> 01:20:08.709
I did see them!

01:20:08.792 --> 01:20:10.292
I saw them all!

01:20:10.459 --> 01:20:11.834
You hear me!?

01:20:11.917 --> 01:20:13.834
Their screams, their pain.

01:20:13.917 --> 01:20:15.917
I have seen it all!

01:20:16.042 --> 01:20:17.251
Everything!

01:20:17.376 --> 01:20:18.792
And they're with me.

01:20:18.876 --> 01:20:20.709
Every night, every day.

01:20:20.834 --> 01:20:23.001
Now in this moment. They're all here!

01:20:23.167 --> 01:20:24.751
They're all here!

01:20:24.834 --> 01:20:26.876
There is no one else. No one!

01:20:26.959 --> 01:20:28.584
I have lost everything!

01:20:28.667 --> 01:20:30.001
Nothing is left.

01:20:30.084 --> 01:20:33.501
It smells of burning flesh.
Even days later.

01:20:33.667 --> 01:20:36.292
It feels like somebody is pouring
gasoline down your nose.

01:20:36.417 --> 01:20:37.709
You can shower all you want.

01:20:37.709 --> 01:20:38.126
But it

01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:38.667
does

01:20:38.709 --> 01:20:39.167
not

01:20:39.209 --> 01:20:41.209
come off!

01:20:42.959 --> 01:20:44.251
What do you think?

01:20:44.376 --> 01:20:47.542
How long does such
a little body stay alive?

01:20:47.709 --> 01:20:48.876
They're already dead.

01:20:48.959 --> 01:20:51.876
They just don't know it yet.

01:20:52.042 --> 01:20:55.084
They have no arms, no legs...

01:20:55.834 --> 01:20:57.626
Every inch of their body is burnt.

01:20:57.709 --> 01:20:59.542
But they keep breathing.

01:20:59.626 --> 01:21:03.626
Going between the trucks with
trash bags, collecting the remains.

01:21:03.709 --> 01:21:05.042
That's what's left.

01:21:05.126 --> 01:21:07.709
A bag of char-coaled junk.

01:24:17.751 --> 01:24:20.751
Do it.

01:24:27.209 --> 01:24:29.209
Flip it.

01:24:29.917 --> 01:24:31.876
Flip it.

01:24:35.667 --> 01:24:38.584
That's what I thought.

01:25:21.376 --> 01:25:24.084
This can't be happening.

01:25:27.834 --> 01:25:29.792
And... What are we going to do now?

01:25:29.876 --> 01:25:30.584
Eat something?

01:25:30.667 --> 01:25:32.667
Yes!

01:25:34.834 --> 01:25:37.709
You have two new messages.

01:25:37.876 --> 01:25:39.834
Here are your new messages.

01:25:39.917 --> 01:25:41.917
<i>Hi, it's Frank.</i>

01:25:42.501 --> 01:25:44.167
<i>You know...</i>

01:25:44.667 --> 01:25:46.667
<i>Shit, I'll never...</i>

01:25:46.834 --> 01:25:49.584
<i>I tried. I really did.</i>

01:25:51.126 --> 01:25:53.542
<i>Whatever happens today...</i>

01:25:53.709 --> 01:25:55.292
<i>at Central Station...</i>

01:25:55.459 --> 01:25:57.959
<i>People will talk.</i>

01:25:58.126 --> 01:26:00.709
<i>But you know me.</i>

01:26:00.876 --> 01:26:03.876
<i>Don't believe what they say.</i>

01:26:04.042 --> 01:26:07.084
<i>Lily means everything to me.</i>

01:26:07.917 --> 01:26:11.542
<i>Do you remember that cave on Mallorca?</i>

01:26:12.001 --> 01:26:15.084
<i>I always wanted to...</i>

01:26:15.667 --> 01:26:18.667
<i>Please take her.</i>

01:26:19.834 --> 01:26:22.834
<i>I have to go.</i>

01:26:23.209 --> 01:26:25.584
Your message has been saved.

01:26:25.709 --> 01:26:28.709
Next message.

01:26:29.792 --> 01:26:32.251
<i>That's it Frank.</i>

01:26:32.417 --> 01:26:35.417
<i>You've really done it now.</i>

01:26:40.209 --> 01:26:42.667
<i>I feel really sorry for your girl, Frank.</i>

01:26:42.834 --> 01:26:43.834
No!

01:26:43.959 --> 01:26:44.917
No!

01:26:45.042 --> 01:26:45.959
No!

01:26:46.042 --> 01:26:47.501
<i>Not...</i>

01:26:47.709 --> 01:26:48.626
<i>Not...</i>

01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:51.501
<i>Not my daughter.</i>

01:26:51.751 --> 01:26:52.709
<i>I'll do...</i>

01:26:52.834 --> 01:26:53.792
<i>I'll do anything.</i>

01:26:53.876 --> 01:26:54.667
<i>Just...</i>

01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:56.626
<i>Please not my daughter.</i>

01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:58.709
<i>Please.</i>
