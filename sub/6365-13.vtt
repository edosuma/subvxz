WEBVTT

00:01.301 --> 00:03.035
<i>Previously on</i> reign...

00:03.037 --> 00:06.071
You cost me more
than you could possibly imagine.

00:06.073 --> 00:07.339
Anything you ask.

00:07.341 --> 00:08.741
You will do and say
as I command.

00:08.743 --> 00:10.242
You were supposed
to befriend francis,

00:10.244 --> 00:11.710
Find out what kind
of king he is.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.312
If the time should come
when you need to choose

00:13.314 --> 00:16.281
Between your new friends
and your family,

00:16.283 --> 00:17.349
Your choice
will be clear.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.717
Mary asked you
to offer yourself

00:18.719 --> 00:20.652
As a possible match for me.

00:20.654 --> 00:22.654
She hoped that we might find
the happiness she's found

00:22.656 --> 00:24.056
With francis.

00:24.058 --> 00:25.724
What does she
take us for?

00:25.726 --> 00:27.393
A couple of game pieces
she can shunt aside

00:27.395 --> 00:28.394
To unclutter her board?

00:28.396 --> 00:29.728
I want a happier life with you.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.730
I still can't bear to be
touched-- even the sound

00:31.732 --> 00:32.765
Of a man breathing
near me is...

00:32.767 --> 00:34.666
I wish I knew how to help.

00:34.668 --> 00:35.667
Just give me time.

00:51.217 --> 00:52.418
Oh, it's here.

00:52.420 --> 00:54.420
The first bloom!

00:56.389 --> 00:59.425
I claim the reward!

00:59.427 --> 01:01.493
First bloom, isn't that grand?

01:01.495 --> 01:03.495
The promise of new life
and new beginnings.

01:03.497 --> 01:07.332
And a rip-roaring party
with new dresses and dancing

01:07.334 --> 01:08.534
To enliven this
dismal winter.

01:08.536 --> 01:09.668
(laughs)

01:09.670 --> 01:10.669
(knocking on door)

01:10.671 --> 01:12.538
Come in, I'm almost ready.

01:14.140 --> 01:16.341
He's just here for a routine
visit, isn't he?

01:16.343 --> 01:17.609
According to antoine's
letter, yes.

01:17.611 --> 01:19.511
He wanted to extend
the peace treaty

01:19.513 --> 01:21.346
Between France
and navarre.

01:21.348 --> 01:23.248
Could have done it
through diplomats,

01:23.250 --> 01:25.250
But he hasn't been here for
years, and now that I'm king,

01:25.252 --> 01:28.120
I suppose he wants
to pay me a visit.

01:28.122 --> 01:30.089
What's this?

01:32.759 --> 01:34.827
A map?

01:34.829 --> 01:37.529
There's an enclave
of the loire valley.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.331
The hills there have
the lushest orchards

01:39.333 --> 01:40.766
And vineyards
in the realm.

01:40.768 --> 01:43.368
The poet marot calls
it the eden of France.

01:43.370 --> 01:45.137
Well, it sounds
glorious, but...

01:45.139 --> 01:47.773
I know how hard things
have been for you.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.842
For us.

01:49.844 --> 01:52.711
I want us to have
a new beginning,

01:52.713 --> 01:54.713
A place we can go

01:54.715 --> 01:56.148
Away from the castle

01:56.150 --> 01:58.283
And all the painful
memories it holds.

01:59.719 --> 02:01.787
There's an
abandoned chÃ¢teau.

02:03.223 --> 02:04.256
Here.

02:04.258 --> 02:05.424
A lord who ran
out of money.

02:05.426 --> 02:06.558
I thought we
could expand it.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.627
It's a beautiful
idea, but...

02:11.164 --> 02:15.534
...What if we go there, and
things don't get better?

02:15.536 --> 02:17.603
Things are
already better.

02:40.493 --> 02:41.393
(gasps)

02:46.332 --> 02:47.466
(screams)

02:50.203 --> 02:52.671
(fast tempo acoustic
intro playing)

02:55.341 --> 02:57.843
â™ª they all need something

02:57.845 --> 03:02.814
â™ª to hold on to,
they all mean well â™ª

03:02.816 --> 03:06.318
â™ª you could never
feel my story â™ª

03:06.320 --> 03:10.289
â™ª it's all you know... Oh!

03:10.291 --> 03:13.425
â™ª

03:19.566 --> 03:21.733
(fanfare plays)

03:23.603 --> 03:25.270
Cousin,

03:25.272 --> 03:26.905
I am delighted
we both wish

03:26.907 --> 03:29.308
To renew the peace treaty
between our two countries.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.310
It is my chief purpose
in coming.

03:31.312 --> 03:33.245
Of course.
And my second purpose

03:33.247 --> 03:34.613
Is to ask for funds.

03:37.550 --> 03:38.984
Navarre has been overrun
by protestant refugees.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.652
French protestants.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.221
They're perfectly
lovely people,

03:42.223 --> 03:44.323
But they are a tax
on our resources.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.491
Now, we'd prefer that they
return home, but apparently

03:46.493 --> 03:50.329
They fear persecution
from the crown.

03:50.331 --> 03:52.531
And you're suggesting that
these refugees are our fault,

03:52.533 --> 03:54.700
And you want us to pay up?

03:55.668 --> 03:57.402
I knew this would be awkward;

03:57.404 --> 03:59.471
That's the problem
with being forthright.

04:00.373 --> 04:02.407
Well, we will consider
your request.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.443
In the meantime, you
are our honored guest.

04:04.445 --> 04:06.511
France and navarre remain
the best of friends.

04:06.513 --> 04:08.513
Of course.

04:13.753 --> 04:15.854
Conde:
Lady lola.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.689
What are all the
decorations for?

04:17.691 --> 04:19.691
Tomorrow night's
winter ease.

04:19.693 --> 04:21.927
The first blooms have been
sighted in the snow.

04:21.929 --> 04:26.265
We feast, dance,
celebrate new beginnings.

04:26.267 --> 04:27.966
But it's still winter.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.968
The blooms will likely
have a short life.

04:29.970 --> 04:32.704
But it's the promise that
spring will come eventually.

04:32.706 --> 04:35.774
Hmm, and do you have an
escort to this feast?

04:35.776 --> 04:38.443
The queen has commanded
that we see one another.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.412
But should you
be there with me?

04:40.414 --> 04:43.315
You're king antoine's liaison
to the french court.

04:43.317 --> 04:46.418
Won't he need you
at his side for introductions?

04:46.420 --> 04:49.288
Oh, my brother always finds
a way to introduce himself.

04:49.290 --> 04:50.956
Kenna: Now, where can we
hang these garlands?

04:53.559 --> 04:55.627
Ah, put them
over there.

04:59.332 --> 05:00.565
I think
you dropped one.

05:00.567 --> 05:03.302
Oh, well, thank you,

05:03.304 --> 05:05.737
Your majesty.
Well, it'd be
a shame to lose track

05:05.739 --> 05:09.975
Of something so vibrant
and beautiful.

05:16.416 --> 05:19.584
Please excuse me,
your majesty.

05:20.687 --> 05:22.487
Excuse me.

05:24.557 --> 05:25.757
Not a quarry
to pursue.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.392
She's married.

05:27.394 --> 05:29.394
Forgive me, I appear to
have lost my hearing.

05:29.396 --> 05:31.029
Since when did you acquire
the moral high ground

05:31.031 --> 05:32.931
When it came to
married women?
I didn't.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.700
But flirting with
the king's sister-in-law

05:34.702 --> 05:36.468
Is probably not
the best diplomatic move.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.705
So that's the king's
bastard half-brother.

05:39.707 --> 05:40.939
Conde:
Yes.

05:42.108 --> 05:43.375
What is it?

05:43.377 --> 05:45.110
I think we may
have met before.

05:49.782 --> 05:51.450
We can afford to give him
a little money.

05:51.452 --> 05:52.918
Don't even think of it.

05:52.920 --> 05:56.021
Francis, how many times did
your father and I warn you

05:56.023 --> 05:57.956
About the bourbons?

05:57.958 --> 06:00.459
Uh, there is a lot of history
between their family and ours,

06:00.461 --> 06:01.526
Most of it bad.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.695
When I was sickly
as a child,

06:03.697 --> 06:05.831
They were considered an
option for the throne.

06:05.833 --> 06:08.467
But it never came
to that.
My father was
convinced

06:08.469 --> 06:10.435
That they were gathering support
to make a move on the crown.

06:10.437 --> 06:12.771
So he sent the bourbon brothers
and their armies

06:12.773 --> 06:15.374
To the front lines during
the italian and spanish wars.

06:15.376 --> 06:17.609
To thin out the ranks
of their supporters.

06:17.611 --> 06:18.777
Teach them a lesson.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.612
Yes, brutally.

06:20.614 --> 06:21.847
I'm sure they haven't
forgotten.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.615
But we welcomed
his brother.

06:23.617 --> 06:26.485
CondÃ©'s never shown the
slightest interest in the crown.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.887
Antoine, on the other hand,
has always been ambitious.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.390
He got his throne by marrying
the queen of navarre.

06:31.392 --> 06:32.657
He's also self-centered.

06:32.659 --> 06:35.394
He's known to be a
reckless spender.

06:35.396 --> 06:37.662
"french refugees." please.

06:37.664 --> 06:39.831
More likely he's burned
through his wife's money

06:39.833 --> 06:40.999
And she's cut him off.

06:41.001 --> 06:43.568
Refuse him,
and send him home!

06:44.804 --> 06:46.405
No.

06:46.407 --> 06:48.106
I want to see what's really
going on in navarre.

06:50.176 --> 06:51.710
What is it?

06:51.712 --> 06:53.712
I think this sebastian
is the man responsible

06:53.714 --> 06:54.913
For our brother's death.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.082
How can you be so sure?

06:57.084 --> 06:59.518
You...

06:59.520 --> 07:02.888
You weren't with us
in the italian wars.

07:02.890 --> 07:05.090
I told you marcus was stabbed;
I didn't tell you how.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.159
There was an, uh...

07:07.161 --> 07:09.161
An abandoned villa,
the villa cortello,

07:09.163 --> 07:10.729
High on the cliffs above figari.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.998
I was to meet marcus there
to get a vantage point,

07:13.000 --> 07:15.500
To judge our enemy's numbers
and location.

07:15.502 --> 07:17.769
I arrived on the path
leading up

07:17.771 --> 07:21.606
And passed a young man
in a french uniform riding away.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.575
I thought
nothing of it

07:23.577 --> 07:26.178
Until I walked
into the grounds of the villa

07:26.180 --> 07:28.480
And saw marcus lying there
in the grass,

07:28.482 --> 07:30.916
Knifed in the back.

07:30.918 --> 07:33.151
He had confirmed that this
french soldier had done it?

07:33.153 --> 07:35.187
Apparently it wasn't enough
for henry to send bourbon armies

07:35.189 --> 07:37.689
To the front line;
he had to take out a bourbon.

07:38.858 --> 07:40.625
And marcus was
the biggest threat.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.462
I searched for that man
among the troops for days,

07:43.464 --> 07:45.530
But I never saw him again.

07:46.532 --> 07:48.533
Until now.

07:48.535 --> 07:51.536
This is a deadly serious matter,
and you need to be sure.

07:51.538 --> 07:53.538
I swear to you,
I will not leave this court

07:53.540 --> 07:56.641
Until I learn the truth.

07:56.643 --> 08:00.745
His-his wife's
a, a fetching little thing.

08:01.714 --> 08:03.849
I wonder what she knows.

08:06.619 --> 08:08.086
Why didn't you tell
me about my sister?

08:08.088 --> 08:09.654
You mean claude?

08:12.191 --> 08:13.959
Why? What have you heard?

08:13.961 --> 08:15.660
Not claude.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.562
Clarissa.
What?

08:17.564 --> 08:19.498
Why didn't you tell me
she's still alive?

08:19.500 --> 08:20.932
Francis, has someone seen her?

08:20.934 --> 08:23.001
First, I want you to tell me
everything you know.

08:24.604 --> 08:27.272
Nostradamus,
he said she was alive.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.107
That the prophecy
was unfulfilled.

08:29.109 --> 08:31.042
But I didn't know if he
just wanted to hurt me.

08:31.044 --> 08:32.777
What if it was true?

08:32.779 --> 08:34.279
It was true.

08:36.716 --> 08:37.949
Francis.

08:39.118 --> 08:40.685
Francis!

08:40.687 --> 08:41.686
(francis gasps)

08:41.688 --> 08:42.721
Francis, no!

08:42.723 --> 08:44.890
Help. Somebody help!

08:44.892 --> 08:46.558
Hurry!
(door opens)

08:46.560 --> 08:48.894
Catherine.

08:48.896 --> 08:49.895
Francis,

08:49.897 --> 08:51.563
He's dying.

09:00.306 --> 09:01.306
(sighs)

09:01.308 --> 09:03.642
I've had a vision.

09:05.578 --> 09:08.747
The prophecy,
it will come to pass.

09:17.023 --> 09:18.823
This is a waste
of time.

09:18.825 --> 09:20.258
Send this foolish man home.

09:20.260 --> 09:23.161
Mary, explain
to your husband

09:23.163 --> 09:24.696
That I have had a vision.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.932
Enough about the prophecy;
it's exhausting.

09:26.934 --> 09:30.168
You don't believe me?
Mother, you are not well.

09:30.170 --> 09:33.004
Bash told us that you
were speaking to people

09:33.006 --> 09:34.239
Who weren't there.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.840
And then there is
the matter of claude.

09:35.842 --> 09:37.175
Well, since bash was
so talkative,

09:37.177 --> 09:38.743
I hope that he also
happened to mention

09:38.745 --> 09:41.179
That it was
an unfortunate error.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.114
Mother, I came as
soon as I heard.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.783
Is it true? Are
you terribly ill?

09:44.785 --> 09:46.251
(chuckles)

09:46.253 --> 09:47.586
(imitating claude):
You sound so hopeful.

09:47.588 --> 09:48.954
I suppose I deserve that.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.355
Doctor:
How long have you had

09:50.357 --> 09:52.824
Those sores on your mouth
and your tongue?

09:54.060 --> 09:55.827
Y-your hands are
afflicted as well?

09:59.131 --> 10:00.599
Well, it's just a little rash.

10:00.601 --> 10:02.133
It doesn't mean anything.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.369
Sores on the body? Seeing
things that aren't there?

10:04.371 --> 10:07.205
And a husband who also
suffered madness?

10:07.207 --> 10:10.041
That can't be
a coincidence.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.911
I don't suppose your husband,
um, uh, took lovers

10:12.913 --> 10:15.213
Outside the
marital bed?

10:17.750 --> 10:19.651
Syphilis?

10:19.653 --> 10:20.885
Oh.

10:20.887 --> 10:22.887
Oh...

10:22.889 --> 10:24.756
Oh, henry!

10:24.758 --> 10:26.958
Oh, that is
so like him!

10:26.960 --> 10:28.793
Hmm?

10:28.795 --> 10:30.996
A last gift so I'll never forget
him or his whores.

10:30.998 --> 10:33.298
Don't be so
gloomy, mother.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.066
I have a rather
rambunctious friend

10:35.068 --> 10:37.068
Who underwent the cures and...

10:37.070 --> 10:38.737
Oh, wait,

10:38.739 --> 10:41.106
She did say they were
rather excruciating.

10:41.108 --> 10:42.674
I'll send

10:42.676 --> 10:43.675
For her specialist.

10:43.677 --> 10:44.776
Why, thank you.
I think

10:44.778 --> 10:46.244
We should all let mother rest.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.013
Claude.
Francis,

10:48.015 --> 10:49.414
Wait, wait.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.685
(sighs)
I've heard that these cures,

10:53.687 --> 10:55.787
They can kill as well as help.

10:55.789 --> 10:56.955
If anything should happen
to me...

10:56.957 --> 10:58.123
Nothing will happen.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.824
...You must protect my legacy.

10:59.826 --> 11:00.925
I don't want to be remembered

11:00.927 --> 11:03.161
As a mad syphilitic queen.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.362
Say that I died
of consumption

11:04.364 --> 11:06.097
While helping orphans.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.399
Yes,

11:07.401 --> 11:08.933
Say that they were ill,

11:08.935 --> 11:10.735
All the little ones,

11:10.737 --> 11:13.938
And I entered the orphanage
without a thought for myself.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.779
I have all your favorites.

11:20.781 --> 11:21.846
Venison, guinea hen pie,

11:21.848 --> 11:23.148
And beer from alsace.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.950
Kenna, I can't stay.

11:25.952 --> 11:29.354
Listen, I know I've made...

11:29.356 --> 11:31.690
Big mistakes,

11:31.692 --> 11:33.925
But tomorrow is winter ease.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.694
It's the time of year
when we're supposed

11:35.696 --> 11:37.696
To look past the darkness
and hope for new beginnings.

11:37.698 --> 11:38.963
I really want that

11:38.965 --> 11:40.699
For our marriage.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.867
I can't just shrug off
what you did,

11:42.869 --> 11:45.303
But, but there
are dark things

11:45.305 --> 11:46.805
In my past as well,

11:46.807 --> 11:47.872
And my mother's,
as I've learned.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.140
Your mother?

11:49.142 --> 11:50.375
Is that why she left?

11:50.377 --> 11:51.876
You never explained.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.478
I-I can't do this
right now, kenna.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.780
There's been a disturbance
in a nearby village.

11:55.782 --> 11:57.315
They say a man clawed
his way out of the grave

11:57.317 --> 11:59.384
And is terrorizing people.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.286
Dead people rising?

12:01.288 --> 12:03.054
So many people have died

12:03.056 --> 12:04.823
Of the plague,
of strife in the villages.

12:04.825 --> 12:07.292
Do you think the destructive
things we do

12:07.294 --> 12:08.860
Simply disappear?

12:08.862 --> 12:10.829
Call it ghosts,
call it shadows,

12:10.831 --> 12:13.031
Call it justice
working itself out.

12:13.033 --> 12:15.333
But I need to go and try
to keep people from harm.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.368
It's the best thing I can do
to make up for the things

12:17.370 --> 12:18.970
That I have done
that I'm not proud of.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.839
Dead men, ghosts, these are

12:20.841 --> 12:22.741
The reasons that you're
leaving me alone right now?

12:22.743 --> 12:24.375
Those pagan uncles of yours

12:24.377 --> 12:26.811
Have really poisoned
your mind with superstition.

12:33.319 --> 12:34.919
Just wait!

12:34.921 --> 12:36.488
Wait!

12:36.490 --> 12:38.923
Just let me say that I'm sorry,
because I am!

12:38.925 --> 12:41.993
I know that I am impulsive,

12:41.995 --> 12:43.862
And I can be my own worst enemy,

12:43.864 --> 12:46.164
But I don't want to be
your worst enemy.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.069
I'll be back tomorrow
before the feast.

12:51.071 --> 12:53.872
We're married for life.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.273
I know we need to make peace,

12:55.275 --> 12:56.841
And we will.

13:03.849 --> 13:06.017
You want me to
gather information

13:06.019 --> 13:07.852
About the king of navarre.

13:07.854 --> 13:09.420
And the state of his country.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.456
I want to know
whether his request

13:11.458 --> 13:12.891
For funds is justified.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.526
Ah.

13:14.528 --> 13:16.828
Well, isn't this
the right mission

13:16.830 --> 13:17.929
For a man of your talents?

13:17.931 --> 13:19.164
I thought you prided yourself

13:19.166 --> 13:21.032
On your widespread contacts

13:21.034 --> 13:22.801
And having your ear
to the ground?

13:22.803 --> 13:24.803
I just want to be sure
that I understand.

13:25.938 --> 13:27.472
Is this really about antoine,

13:27.474 --> 13:29.040
Or are you trying to get rid

13:29.042 --> 13:30.809
Of condÃ© by association?

13:30.811 --> 13:32.877
I beg your pardon?

13:32.879 --> 13:34.813
I'm only humbly suggesting

13:34.815 --> 13:37.816
That if your true intent
is to rid yourself of a rival,

13:37.818 --> 13:39.884
Then this doesn't need
to be a political matter.

13:39.886 --> 13:41.219
This could simply be
a matter of...

13:42.321 --> 13:43.988
...Sudden accident.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.825
(chuckles)

13:46.827 --> 13:47.992
My god, you just...

13:47.994 --> 13:51.062
Can't help yourself, can you?

13:51.064 --> 13:52.363
Goading the king.

13:52.365 --> 13:54.199
You are alive

13:54.201 --> 13:55.333
At my mercy,

13:55.335 --> 13:56.835
And even in passing,

13:56.837 --> 13:58.203
You pour poison into my thoughts

13:58.205 --> 14:00.905
About my wife.
Please, don't pretend

14:00.907 --> 14:01.973
That these are new thoughts.

14:01.975 --> 14:03.608
You've seen condÃ© buzzing

14:03.610 --> 14:05.243
Around mary.
Oh, do shut up, narcisse,

14:05.245 --> 14:06.377
And do as you're told.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.112
You exist to serve me now.

14:08.114 --> 14:10.949
Nothing more.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.984
Majesty.

14:14.486 --> 14:17.055
Although I should warn you,

14:17.057 --> 14:19.257
Though antoine is king
of a tiny nation,

14:19.259 --> 14:20.925
His foes don't tend to survive.

14:20.927 --> 14:23.161
Another thing that makes
you the man for the job.

14:27.032 --> 14:28.099
Lady kenna.

14:28.101 --> 14:30.134
Ah, I see you know my name now.

14:30.136 --> 14:31.936
I was hoping you might give me
a tour of the castle.

14:31.938 --> 14:34.005
I don't think I'd be
the best guide for you,

14:34.007 --> 14:36.074
As you have a bit
of a reputation, your majesty.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.909
Well, antoine,

14:37.911 --> 14:39.978
As I hope we'll be friends.

14:39.980 --> 14:42.113
Lady kenna, all I
was hoping for here

14:42.115 --> 14:45.583
Is a, uh, pleasant companion
to show me the castle.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.418
I know the stories
that are told about me,

14:47.420 --> 14:49.621
But don't you think
that people can be more

14:49.623 --> 14:51.289
Than their reputations?

14:51.291 --> 14:52.523
All I want is to talk,

14:52.525 --> 14:53.958
Get to know you better.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.994
Learn all your...

14:55.996 --> 14:57.262
Secrets.

14:59.999 --> 15:01.432
You are terrible.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.001
Tell me about
your husband, then.

15:10.910 --> 15:14.946
I hear you're seeing the prince
of condÃ© these days.

15:14.948 --> 15:18.917
Though the man is so boring
and predictable,

15:18.919 --> 15:20.385
I can hardly believe
it's true.

15:20.387 --> 15:21.986
Tell me,

15:21.988 --> 15:24.589
Is someone making you spend time
with him?

15:26.091 --> 15:27.992
Well, I assume you'll
be going to the feast

15:27.994 --> 15:29.394
With the prince
tomorrow night,

15:29.396 --> 15:31.095
So I won't ask you to
accompany me instead,

15:31.097 --> 15:33.698
But, uh, I have
a better idea.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.066
Really?

15:35.068 --> 15:36.434
Once the feast is over

15:36.436 --> 15:38.636
And you've had
your quota of, uh, boredom,

15:38.638 --> 15:42.073
We could go to the hot
springs in the hills.

15:42.075 --> 15:46.077
On a cold winter's night,
there is nothing more sensual.

15:46.079 --> 15:49.314
You could wear your thickest
stockings for the ride up,

15:49.316 --> 15:51.282
And then I could help
you peel them off.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.584
I can't believe you're still
making these suggestions.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.086
The king discredited you.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.587
You don't even have
a house now.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.423
It would be a mistake

15:58.425 --> 16:00.992
To think that
I will not be back on top.

16:00.994 --> 16:03.494
Wear the flower on your
dress at the feast,

16:03.496 --> 16:06.064
And when I see it,

16:06.066 --> 16:08.633
I'll know that you're agreed.

16:12.404 --> 16:15.173
Your particular disease
runs rampant

16:15.175 --> 16:18.743
In the form of black bile,
which is a heavy humor

16:18.745 --> 16:20.645
And tends to puddle
in the lower body.

16:23.082 --> 16:25.350
These birds will peck openings

16:25.352 --> 16:27.051
In your feet
and suck the bile

16:27.053 --> 16:30.088
Into themselves
along with your blood.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.323
You will get better,

16:32.325 --> 16:34.192
And the birds will become ill.

16:34.194 --> 16:37.061
That is fascinating,
isn't it, mother?

16:38.230 --> 16:40.231
(chirping)
ow! Ooh!

16:40.233 --> 16:42.433
Doctor, how long do I have
to endure this?

16:42.435 --> 16:43.701
Five minutes?

16:43.703 --> 16:45.269
Ten? Ow!

16:45.271 --> 16:46.504
The longer, the better.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.206
Aah!
I'll prepare the next stage

16:48.208 --> 16:49.407
And return in one hour.

16:49.409 --> 16:51.042
Take two hours.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.110
Three if need be.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.012
Whatever's best for my mother.

16:54.014 --> 16:56.581
(winces) this-- ow--
this is torturous,

16:56.583 --> 16:59.350
But it pains me more
that you are enjoying this so.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.052
Oh, it hurts, I'm sure.

17:01.054 --> 17:02.653
Do you know what else hurts?

17:02.655 --> 17:03.755
Poison!

17:03.757 --> 17:05.156
My stomach

17:05.158 --> 17:06.357
Still aches from your efforts

17:06.359 --> 17:07.658
To slowly kill me.

17:11.797 --> 17:14.065
(dog whines)

17:16.068 --> 17:17.702
Francis,
I wanted to thank you

17:17.704 --> 17:19.203
For everything
you've done for me,

17:19.205 --> 17:20.671
And everything you're doing.

17:20.673 --> 17:23.074
The new chÃ¢teau
isn't just for you.

17:23.076 --> 17:25.109
(chuckles)
it's for the both of us.

17:25.111 --> 17:26.544
And I'm sure
it will be wonderful,

17:26.546 --> 17:27.812
But I'm not just talking
about that.

17:27.814 --> 17:30.181
It means a lot to me

17:30.183 --> 17:34.152
That you're happy sleeping here
on this divan night after night.

17:34.154 --> 17:35.787
Near me,

17:35.789 --> 17:37.822
But not so close I feel uneasy.

17:37.824 --> 17:41.125
We'll do things
in our own time, my love.

17:41.127 --> 17:43.061
If you want me
to sleep here

17:43.063 --> 17:44.128
For the rest of the year,

17:44.130 --> 17:46.564
I don't object.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.534
Yes, well,

17:49.536 --> 17:51.235
It seems rather silly,

17:51.237 --> 17:52.703
When there's a perfectly good

17:52.705 --> 17:55.206
Goose feather bed right here.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.308
â™ª so long I've swam

17:57.310 --> 18:00.578
â™ª in search of solid ground...

18:00.580 --> 18:02.213
You mean tonight?

18:02.215 --> 18:05.249
U-unless you've grown fond
of that spot.

18:05.251 --> 18:10.555
â™ª and she's all I see

18:10.557 --> 18:14.158
â™ª when I'm in need

18:14.160 --> 18:18.729
â™ª sunlight be gone...

18:18.731 --> 18:21.265
I only meant for us to sleep.

18:21.267 --> 18:22.733
Of course.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.102
â™ª to make you proud...

18:24.104 --> 18:26.204
Good night.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.772
â™ª you're all that I need

18:27.774 --> 18:32.243
â™ª when I run aground.

18:33.245 --> 18:36.447
Narcisse: I need you to find
out everything that you can.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.516
Ask everyone.

18:44.356 --> 18:45.590
Lord narcisse,

18:45.592 --> 18:47.458
Lovely to see you skulking

18:47.460 --> 18:49.327
About the castle again.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.229
I'm here
on your brother's behalf,

18:51.231 --> 18:52.263
Always ready to serve

18:52.265 --> 18:54.298
Our king.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.833
But wouldn't it be more fun
to serve me?

18:57.136 --> 18:58.536
In the bedchamber, I mean.

18:58.538 --> 19:01.139
Ah.

19:01.141 --> 19:03.608
And I also want you to tutor me
in matters of court intrigue.

19:03.610 --> 19:07.311
I'm flattered by you seeking
my expertise,

19:07.313 --> 19:09.780
But what, may I ask,
prompted this request?

19:09.782 --> 19:12.550
I avoided more
than one engagement of late,

19:12.552 --> 19:15.553
But it's only a matter of time
till I end up a chess piece

19:15.555 --> 19:17.221
In some convenient marriage.

19:17.223 --> 19:20.224
Unless I learn to play
some chess myself.

19:20.226 --> 19:24.262
Well, if you would like
an older,

19:24.264 --> 19:28.399
Parental figure
to help guide you...

19:30.169 --> 19:32.236
...I'm happy to guide
as closely...

19:33.372 --> 19:35.439
...As you would like.

19:47.319 --> 19:48.352
(screaming)

19:57.329 --> 19:59.397
(gasping)

20:01.900 --> 20:04.202
Mary?

20:04.204 --> 20:05.303
I'm sorry.

20:05.305 --> 20:07.305
I couldn't bear it.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.440
The sound of a man's breath
next to me.

20:15.847 --> 20:17.515
Let me help you.

20:17.517 --> 20:19.684
There's nothing you can do.

20:19.686 --> 20:22.853
I can tell you that
what happened was a nightmare.

20:23.989 --> 20:26.257
The nightmare is over.

20:43.609 --> 20:46.277
(sobbing)

20:54.553 --> 20:56.721
I didn't know the man.

20:56.723 --> 20:58.556
The priest found him
the other morning,

20:58.558 --> 21:01.425
Dead from sleeping
in the cold.

21:01.427 --> 21:04.328
The gravedigger put him
in a pauper's grave.

21:04.330 --> 21:05.997
But he must have rose
up during the night.

21:10.802 --> 21:13.437
There's been talk in
other villages, too.

21:13.439 --> 21:15.973
Of the dead rising and visiting
their families in the night.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.441
Maybe.

21:17.443 --> 21:18.876
But people grieving
often see loved ones

21:18.878 --> 21:20.578
In dreams and believe
they've seen a ghost.

21:20.580 --> 21:21.879
This was no dream.

21:21.881 --> 21:24.282
I saw him, and
he came after me.

21:24.284 --> 21:26.350
And I ran-- ran
till I got home.

21:27.753 --> 21:29.353
The men are searching
in the woods

21:29.355 --> 21:30.488
But haven't found
him, have they?

21:31.490 --> 21:33.324
Because he's
hell's own.

21:33.326 --> 21:35.326
Whatever you saw
left footprints.

21:35.328 --> 21:36.427
So I'll find him,

21:36.429 --> 21:38.562
Hell's own or not.

21:40.565 --> 21:43.301
("I am overcome"
by jared lutes begins)

21:43.303 --> 21:45.936
â™ª hold you here
inside my heart... â™ª

21:45.938 --> 21:47.938
So this is
winter ease.

21:47.940 --> 21:49.740
Even the servants
look pleased.

21:49.742 --> 21:51.742
Lola: Well, we've had
harsh weather for so long.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.811
We could all do
with a respite.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.650
I haven't seen mary look
this happy in a long time.

21:59.652 --> 22:03.387
â™ª in the shadow
of the mountain â™ª

22:03.389 --> 22:05.389
â™ª a lonely hero stands...

22:05.391 --> 22:07.358
Well, and once again
you're unescorted.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.060
You know, I'm
starting to believe

22:09.062 --> 22:11.362
You made this husband of yours
up to discourage men like me.

22:11.364 --> 22:12.997
Bash will be here.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.899
His duties as king's deputy
keep him busy.

22:14.901 --> 22:15.900
Ah...

22:15.902 --> 22:18.069
King's deputy.

22:18.071 --> 22:20.071
So that's the post
francis created for him.

22:20.073 --> 22:21.906
Thank god for nepotism.

22:21.908 --> 22:23.908
Otherwise, what would
our bastard brothers do?

22:23.910 --> 22:25.576
Bash is more than
qualified for the position.

22:25.578 --> 22:26.777
He's known
for his fairness

22:26.779 --> 22:28.612
And can back it up
with his sword.

22:28.614 --> 22:31.615
Oh, lovely kenna,
I meant no offense.

22:31.617 --> 22:33.584
But there's a difference
between the "feats of arms"

22:33.586 --> 22:35.586
That nobles spar
at for amusement

22:35.588 --> 22:37.588
And using a sword
in earnest.

22:37.590 --> 22:39.590
Bash was with king henry
during the italian wars,

22:39.592 --> 22:41.125
I would hardly call
that amusement.

22:41.127 --> 22:42.426
The italian wars?

22:42.428 --> 22:45.396
He sounds like an
impressive man.

22:45.398 --> 22:47.465
Tell me more.

22:53.505 --> 22:55.573
(man grunting)

23:00.512 --> 23:01.445
Please don't hurt me, please.

23:01.447 --> 23:03.781
Who are you?

23:03.783 --> 23:05.883
A-aristeo gianopoulos.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.051
You're greek?

23:08.387 --> 23:10.888
What are you doing here?

23:10.890 --> 23:13.657
I came to the village
looking for work.

23:13.659 --> 23:16.527
I was just trying
to earn my fare back to crete.

23:16.529 --> 23:18.162
I don't know
what happened.

23:18.164 --> 23:19.997
I fell asleep
in a churchyard,

23:19.999 --> 23:21.966
And woke in a small
dark place.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.134
A coffin.

23:23.136 --> 23:24.502
I was terrified.

23:24.504 --> 23:26.137
I kept pounding at the lid.

23:26.139 --> 23:29.640
Once I got out, I tried
to talk to people, but...

23:29.642 --> 23:30.674
They didn't
take it well.

23:30.676 --> 23:31.675
You can't blame them.

23:31.677 --> 23:33.511
I'm an unclean thing.

23:34.679 --> 23:36.647
Something dead
that shouldn't be here.

23:37.983 --> 23:40.484
This shroud is all I have
to keep warm.

23:40.486 --> 23:42.553
You feel cold.

23:42.555 --> 23:43.888
You feel hunger.

23:43.890 --> 23:46.090
That means you're
a living man.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.825
No, I was dead.

23:47.827 --> 23:49.827
A great physician named
nostradamus told me

23:49.829 --> 23:53.030
That sometimes a person can
be unconscious for days

23:53.032 --> 23:55.833
And be buried,
mistaken for dead.

23:55.835 --> 23:58.536
I'm telling you I was dead,
and I did not rise on my own.

23:58.538 --> 24:00.604
I saw a woman,

24:00.606 --> 24:03.073
Dressed all in white,
bending over me.

24:03.075 --> 24:05.476
She took my hand

24:05.478 --> 24:07.912
And pulled me
from the grave.

24:07.914 --> 24:10.548
She brought me
back to life.

24:12.517 --> 24:16.921
These new provenÃ§al dances
are intriguing, aren't they?

24:16.923 --> 24:19.857
Uh, I'm not much
of a dancer.

24:19.859 --> 24:22.526
Your pardon.

24:22.528 --> 24:24.595
Excuse me
for a moment.

24:27.532 --> 24:29.967
I see you're still
hovering near kenna.

24:29.969 --> 24:31.802
Well?

24:31.804 --> 24:34.472
Well, such a bewitching
little siren.

24:34.474 --> 24:36.607
Yeah, she responds to
pressure like a sweet arabian

24:36.609 --> 24:38.476
I keep back home-- just
a touch to go left,

24:38.478 --> 24:39.944
A touch to slow down.

24:39.946 --> 24:43.881
She confirmed that bash was with
henry during the italian wars.

24:43.883 --> 24:45.883
Thousands of men were with henry
during the italian wars.

24:45.885 --> 24:47.885
It's not enough.
I want to be
convinced as well.

24:47.887 --> 24:49.620
I'll get more
information.

24:51.656 --> 24:53.791
Not from kenna, I hope.

24:55.494 --> 24:56.961
Press her too hard,
it'll begin to look

24:56.963 --> 24:58.596
Like the bourbons
are on some kind

24:58.598 --> 24:59.697
Of vengeance-seeking
mission.

25:00.665 --> 25:02.566
You seem
overly concerned

25:02.568 --> 25:04.134
With your friends
from the valois court.

25:04.136 --> 25:05.903
Perhaps you spend
too much time with them.

25:05.905 --> 25:07.605
And their queen.

25:07.607 --> 25:09.807
I know my duty.
Do you?

25:09.809 --> 25:12.243
Our brother marcus was doing
his duty at the front line

25:12.245 --> 25:13.944
When henry sent in
his assassin.

25:13.946 --> 25:16.580
Have you forgotten how long
it took him to die?

25:16.582 --> 25:19.149
Unmanned, without the use
of his legs, in crippling pain.

25:19.151 --> 25:20.985
I know.
It made him bitter.

25:20.987 --> 25:22.553
Unlike your good-tempered
friends here.

25:22.555 --> 25:24.622
In his misery,
he drove his wife away

25:24.624 --> 25:25.823
And drank himself
to death.

25:25.825 --> 25:28.158
I know!

25:29.661 --> 25:30.895
I know.

25:30.897 --> 25:33.063
Never forget
whose side you're on.

25:33.065 --> 25:35.599
Who's your blood
and who is not.

25:35.601 --> 25:37.701
It's not something
they'll forget, either.

25:42.674 --> 25:44.108
Antoine wasn't lying.

25:44.110 --> 25:46.010
There are refugees
in navarre.

25:46.012 --> 25:49.280
They've never been a wealthy
country-- they need help.

25:49.282 --> 25:50.814
I fail to see
what's so urgent

25:50.816 --> 25:52.683
You had to call us
from the feast.

25:52.685 --> 25:54.552
England has offered that help.

25:55.820 --> 25:57.621
There have been
secret conferences

25:57.623 --> 26:00.624
Between antoine and one of
elizabeth's most trusted agents.

26:00.626 --> 26:03.694
The rumor is that english
troops may be preparing

26:03.696 --> 26:05.863
To enter navarre and be
quartered there on our borders.

26:05.865 --> 26:07.865
My god, english
troops that close.

26:07.867 --> 26:10.701
They could attack french
targets in days, hours.

26:10.703 --> 26:12.102
Are you sure?

26:12.104 --> 26:14.705
No, that's the problem
with clandestine intelligence.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.740
It works by links
of informants and hearsay.

26:16.742 --> 26:18.342
One can never be sure
anything is true.

26:18.344 --> 26:19.944
We must find out.

26:19.946 --> 26:21.946
If it is true, if we
don't stop them at once...

26:21.948 --> 26:24.014
England could invade
any time they choose.

26:39.764 --> 26:41.765
Claude: I thought
you'd never get here.

26:41.767 --> 26:44.635
Narcisse: I was
detained by politics.

26:44.637 --> 26:46.637
Claude:
Are you sure it wasn't some
pretty girl that detained you?

26:46.639 --> 26:48.806
Narcisse: An accomplished man
can handle both.

26:55.080 --> 26:56.614
I just saw narcisse

26:56.616 --> 26:58.215
With claude.

26:58.217 --> 26:59.283
In there?

26:59.285 --> 27:00.684
Really?

27:00.686 --> 27:02.219
Oh, I'm so sorry.

27:02.221 --> 27:04.021
Well, it's nothing
to be sorry about.

27:04.023 --> 27:06.624
I'm being courted by
a handsome prince, literally.

27:06.626 --> 27:10.894
It's just-- narcisse's efforts
to pull me in irritate me.

27:10.896 --> 27:13.931
Well, they wouldn't irritate you
if you had no interest in him.

27:17.035 --> 27:19.770
You want me to
spy on my brother.

27:19.772 --> 27:22.139
I need you to find out
if the threat

27:22.141 --> 27:24.141
To this country's
survival is real.

27:24.143 --> 27:26.143
I know it puts you
in a difficult position,

27:26.145 --> 27:27.778
But there is
no one else.
No.

27:29.314 --> 27:30.714
I've been an
obedient subject.

27:30.716 --> 27:33.017
I've courted claude
and now lola.

27:33.019 --> 27:35.819
I haven't objected to your
management of my personal life.

27:37.022 --> 27:38.856
But I will not spy
on my brother.

27:38.858 --> 27:41.859
You don't reciprocate
my feelings, very well.

27:41.861 --> 27:43.427
Don't then take
advantage of them.

27:43.429 --> 27:45.329
Don't treat me as an
intimate when I'm not.

27:45.331 --> 27:49.333
I will advise you, though,
strictly as your friend.

27:49.335 --> 27:52.069
I have no idea what antoine
is doing with England.

27:52.071 --> 27:53.437
But if the rumors
are true, you should

27:53.439 --> 27:55.005
Give him the money
he's asking for.

27:55.007 --> 27:57.141
Like any other king,
he can be bought.

27:58.443 --> 28:00.778
Your majesty.

28:00.780 --> 28:03.280
Claude is probably just
a link back to the royal family

28:03.282 --> 28:05.783
For narcisse.
A road back to power.

28:05.785 --> 28:07.718
And a very beautiful
road at that.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.086
Oh, I thought you didn't care.

28:09.088 --> 28:11.689
I don't.
It's just...

28:11.691 --> 28:13.757
That man is incapable
of forming an attachment

28:13.759 --> 28:15.759
With anyone who can't
do something for him.

28:15.761 --> 28:17.728
And he's
unpredictable.

28:17.730 --> 28:20.698
You can't tell what he'll
do next or with whom.

28:20.700 --> 28:23.333
I want a
reliable man.

28:23.335 --> 28:25.703
Predictable, in fact.
I value predictability.

28:25.705 --> 28:27.971
People don't
appreciate it enough.

28:27.973 --> 28:29.473
Would you like to dance?

28:29.475 --> 28:32.176
I'd love to.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.027
You know what
I'm thinking about?

28:50.029 --> 28:51.795
What?
Sex.

28:51.797 --> 28:53.497
I should certainly hope so.

28:53.499 --> 28:55.733
And its unfortunate
side effect

28:55.735 --> 28:58.068
Known as pregnancy.

28:58.070 --> 29:00.337
There are methods that we can
employ to prevent that.

29:00.339 --> 29:03.073
Yes, but I'm not sure
I trust you to be diligent.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.976
In case you have
some keen plan to impregnate

29:05.978 --> 29:08.212
Me and marry
into the royal family,

29:08.214 --> 29:11.381
Please know
I won't let that happen.

29:11.383 --> 29:12.883
It was your idea

29:12.885 --> 29:14.785
That we become lovers.

29:14.787 --> 29:15.919
And we shall.

29:15.921 --> 29:18.922
There are many ways
to pleasure each other

29:18.924 --> 29:20.758
And I'm open to all of them,

29:20.760 --> 29:23.393
Except the one
that produces a child.

29:23.395 --> 29:26.997
You are full of orders.

29:26.999 --> 29:29.066
And what if I refuse?

29:29.068 --> 29:32.770
As your station
is as low as it can go

29:32.772 --> 29:35.305
And I'm a princess, let's

29:35.307 --> 29:37.508
Do things my way, shall we?

29:37.510 --> 29:41.311
Well, given those terms, I...

29:41.313 --> 29:43.380
I must respectfully decline.

29:46.017 --> 29:47.818
You can't just walk away.

29:47.820 --> 29:49.520
Oh, if I'm not myself,

29:49.522 --> 29:51.989
You wouldn't like me
anyway, princess.

29:51.991 --> 29:54.858
Oh, seeing I'm leaving
you without a mentor,

29:54.860 --> 29:56.093
I will give you

29:56.095 --> 29:58.896
This one lesson free of charge:

29:58.898 --> 30:00.197
There are those
who merely

30:00.199 --> 30:02.466
Believe they have power,

30:02.468 --> 30:05.803
And there are those
who actually have it.

30:09.007 --> 30:12.042
We wish to speak with you
about your request for funds.

30:12.044 --> 30:13.977
What, now?

30:13.979 --> 30:15.879
If you're not too busy.

30:15.881 --> 30:17.948
Very well.

30:28.293 --> 30:31.895
You will all
remain outside.

30:34.999 --> 30:38.001
We hear that England
has been negotiating with you

30:38.003 --> 30:40.370
To station troops in navarre.

30:40.372 --> 30:44.007
Or perhaps
it's just a rumor.

30:44.009 --> 30:45.409
You won't
be leaving

30:45.411 --> 30:47.044
Until you tell us the truth.

30:47.046 --> 30:49.580
Well, perhaps not even then,

30:49.582 --> 30:51.281
Your message is.

30:52.517 --> 30:54.518
Very well.

30:54.520 --> 30:57.054
I've had conversations
with english agents.

30:57.056 --> 30:59.523
They've offered quite a sizable
amount in exchange for allowing

30:59.525 --> 31:00.858
Their troops in navarre.

31:00.860 --> 31:03.560
You come here to talk peace

31:03.562 --> 31:06.163
And you were dealing with our
greatest enemy behind our backs?

31:06.165 --> 31:08.131
Well, I didn't ask
elizabeth to approach me,

31:08.133 --> 31:10.334
Nor do I particularly want
to make a deal with her.

31:10.336 --> 31:13.570
But navarre,
a very small nation...

31:13.572 --> 31:16.006
Strategically positioned
at our backs.

31:16.008 --> 31:17.941
Needs to find money
from somewhere.

31:17.943 --> 31:19.943
You've been conspiring
with our enemy.

31:19.945 --> 31:22.412
Give us one reason why
we wouldn't kill you now.

31:22.414 --> 31:24.514
Well, I'll give you two.

31:24.516 --> 31:26.917
If I don't return safely
to navarre, my wife jeanne

31:26.919 --> 31:29.052
Will be understandably upset...

31:29.054 --> 31:31.288
And all the more eager
to accommodate England.

31:31.290 --> 31:33.624
Besides, consider
my position. I came

31:33.626 --> 31:37.027
Here to make a deal with you
rather than elizabeth.

31:37.029 --> 31:38.996
If she finds out, my head'll
be on a chopping block.

31:38.998 --> 31:40.430
You are not an
english subject,

31:40.432 --> 31:42.599
And you are a king
in your own right.

31:42.601 --> 31:44.468
I'm sure you'll be able
to talk your way out of it.

31:44.470 --> 31:47.204
Thank you, yes,
I'm... Known for my charm.

31:47.206 --> 31:49.306
But elizabeth is
still new to her rule

31:49.308 --> 31:50.974
And must guard against coups
from those

31:50.976 --> 31:52.976
Who wish to condemn
a lone female monarch.

31:52.978 --> 31:55.545
So she's building a network
of spies loyal only to her.

31:55.547 --> 31:57.948
She makes
everyone nervous.

31:57.950 --> 31:59.549
Including me.

31:59.551 --> 32:01.285
Mary: You know
so much about her.

32:01.287 --> 32:04.087
Why don't you show
what a friend you are to France,

32:04.089 --> 32:05.088
And tell us

32:05.090 --> 32:06.256
Why she wishes
to make

32:06.258 --> 32:08.091
Such an extreme move now.

32:08.093 --> 32:10.260
Your brutal actions
against french protestants

32:10.262 --> 32:12.396
Have... Unnerved her.

32:12.398 --> 32:14.431
England is a
protestant country,
and it would seem

32:14.433 --> 32:18.101
The king and queen of France
wish to crush protestants.

32:18.103 --> 32:19.603
She's taking
preemptive measures.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.471
She thinks we plan
to attack her?

32:21.473 --> 32:23.273
She sees it as
the first steps

32:23.275 --> 32:25.609
Towards positioning you...
A catholic queen,

32:25.611 --> 32:27.144
To take her throne.

32:27.146 --> 32:29.112
Of course it would
appear that way.

32:29.114 --> 32:31.048
We've practically declared
ourselves her enemy.

32:31.050 --> 32:32.215
I hope that France

32:32.217 --> 32:33.583
Will see its way clear

32:33.585 --> 32:35.152
To giving navarre
the money it needs.

32:35.154 --> 32:36.653
It really
seems that

32:36.655 --> 32:38.655
That would be best for everyone.

32:47.298 --> 32:49.566
As bile is
a cold humor,

32:49.568 --> 32:52.035
Your body must be
heated to balance it.

32:52.037 --> 32:54.137
Delightful.

32:54.139 --> 32:56.306
This is a well-known
cure for syphilis.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.141
God's mercy
with you.

32:58.143 --> 33:00.010
(exhales)

33:00.012 --> 33:01.511
Wait, wait. Wait!

33:01.513 --> 33:03.046
Uh, my water!

33:03.048 --> 33:05.649
I wanted it first!
(sighs)

33:05.651 --> 33:08.051
(door opens)
oh.

33:08.053 --> 33:10.053
(door closes)
(sighs)

33:10.055 --> 33:11.989
Thank heavens.
The water

33:11.991 --> 33:13.757
Is on the table.

33:15.393 --> 33:17.060
Please forgive
the intrusion.

33:17.062 --> 33:18.628
I was passing, I heard
you calling, and...

33:25.503 --> 33:27.337
(exhales)
thank you.

33:27.339 --> 33:29.573
(sighs)

33:31.542 --> 33:33.143
Well, uh...

33:33.145 --> 33:36.079
Unless there's anything else...
Oh, stop it.

33:36.081 --> 33:38.348
Clearly, you know
what this thing is,

33:38.350 --> 33:40.684
And you're not surprised
I'm inside it.

33:40.686 --> 33:43.720
Yes, I have seen a mercury
oven before, and...

33:43.722 --> 33:47.024
Claude may have, uh,
mentioned your illness

33:47.026 --> 33:49.126
To anyone
within hearing.

33:49.128 --> 33:50.594
(sighs)

33:50.596 --> 33:53.130
May I?

33:53.132 --> 33:55.265
I don't know
who she is

33:55.267 --> 33:58.068
Or why she brought
me back to life.

33:58.070 --> 34:00.203
You were disoriented--
maybe you imagined a figure,

34:00.205 --> 34:02.072
A kind woman helping you.

34:03.141 --> 34:05.075
(dog barks)
man: There he is!

34:05.077 --> 34:06.610
The demon's still
in his shroud!

34:06.612 --> 34:08.045
Don't run.

34:08.047 --> 34:09.813
It'll only send them
into a hunting frenzy.

34:09.815 --> 34:12.149
You can't stop them.
Trust me!

34:12.151 --> 34:13.717
Man:
Kill him!

34:14.552 --> 34:16.520
Bash:
Wait! Stop!

34:16.522 --> 34:18.655
Man:
Shoot him!
Bash: No!

34:18.657 --> 34:19.790
(arrow whooshes)

34:19.792 --> 34:21.124
(grunts)

34:22.126 --> 34:23.460
(dog barking)

34:23.462 --> 34:25.162
Man:
Good one, lad. You got him.

34:30.368 --> 34:31.668
(exhaling):
Oh...

34:31.670 --> 34:33.503
Why are you being so thoughtful?

34:33.505 --> 34:35.172
I sat beside my brother

34:35.174 --> 34:37.474
As he went through
a round of the cures.

34:37.476 --> 34:40.077
But on the good side,
he did say the dry heat

34:40.079 --> 34:41.745
From the oven gave
him some relief

34:41.747 --> 34:44.081
From the sores
all over his body.

34:44.083 --> 34:47.217
I only have sores in my mouth
and on my hands,

34:47.219 --> 34:49.219
So it's not very helpful.

34:53.224 --> 34:55.225
Catherine... We
are both veterans

34:55.227 --> 34:57.527
Of the game, are we not,
so I hope you'll forgive

34:57.529 --> 35:00.697
The question, but is it possible
that you don't have syphilis?

35:00.699 --> 35:02.766
That you've been poisoned?

35:02.768 --> 35:05.268
Don't you think
I take precautions?

35:05.270 --> 35:06.837
I meant no offense.

35:06.839 --> 35:09.106
But it does seem strange
that your sores

35:09.108 --> 35:10.607
Are exactly where you
would touch food,

35:10.609 --> 35:12.576
Picking it up, putting
it into your mouth?

35:12.578 --> 35:16.179
My system of food tasters
is impeccable.
Yes,

35:16.181 --> 35:18.181
But not all poison
is delivered through food.

35:18.183 --> 35:20.250
Is there something
that...

35:20.252 --> 35:24.254
(sighs) you touch often,
something no one else uses?

35:26.257 --> 35:28.859
Uh... Not your clothing--

35:28.861 --> 35:31.294
Your laundress cleanses that.

35:31.296 --> 35:32.696
Wait.

35:34.599 --> 35:37.200
I do read henry's bible.

35:37.202 --> 35:38.802
I took it from his room

35:38.804 --> 35:40.504
After his death--
I've been reading it

35:40.506 --> 35:42.472
For comfort
nearly every day.

35:42.474 --> 35:44.541
It belonged to henry,
and henry went mad.

35:44.543 --> 35:47.244
And now it belongs to you.

35:48.212 --> 35:50.714
This will tell us.

35:50.716 --> 35:52.415
(sighs)

35:53.684 --> 35:55.719
(sizzles)

35:55.721 --> 35:58.522
The book is deadly.

36:05.897 --> 36:08.165
â™ª there were three ravens
sat on a tree â™ª

36:08.167 --> 36:10.367
â™ª down, hey, down,
hey, down â™ª

36:10.369 --> 36:12.369
â™ª hey, down,
they were black... â™ª

36:12.371 --> 36:14.638
(continues singing)
here you go, sir.
Let's, let's come down now.

36:14.640 --> 36:15.906
Knaves!

36:15.908 --> 36:16.907
I will stuff

36:16.909 --> 36:18.341
Some poetry

36:18.343 --> 36:19.176
Into your souls.

36:19.178 --> 36:20.310
Excellent song.

36:20.312 --> 36:21.311
Thank you.

36:21.313 --> 36:23.246
I, uh... Have another.

36:23.248 --> 36:24.648
But your bottle
is almost empty.

36:24.650 --> 36:25.749
We can't have that.

36:25.751 --> 36:27.284
Why don't
you let me

36:27.286 --> 36:28.451
Help you down,

36:28.453 --> 36:29.953
And we'll go reconnoiter
the kitchens

36:29.955 --> 36:31.288
For some warm mulled wine.

36:31.290 --> 36:33.256
(sighs):
Ah... You're a man

36:33.258 --> 36:35.592
Of sensibility.

36:35.594 --> 36:36.560
Well, here.

36:36.562 --> 36:39.396
Hold... My bottle.

36:39.398 --> 36:40.564
No.

36:40.566 --> 36:42.365
No.

36:42.367 --> 36:43.733
My sword. No.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.569
My... Bottle.

36:45.571 --> 36:47.237
(sighs):
Ah.

36:48.506 --> 36:50.340
(grunts)

36:50.342 --> 36:51.508
Oh, how I...

36:51.510 --> 36:53.376
Love...

36:53.378 --> 36:54.578
The wine in France.

36:54.580 --> 36:56.980
Bash:
Many do.
And from here,

36:56.982 --> 37:00.217
I shall go into corsica-- with
two beauties of my acquaintance,

37:00.219 --> 37:01.918
By the way.
We will lie...

37:01.920 --> 37:04.721
In front...
Of the villa cortello

37:04.723 --> 37:06.489
On the beach,

37:06.491 --> 37:09.392
Drinking and making love
in the sand.

37:09.394 --> 37:11.228
Well, good luck--
the villa cortello's

37:11.230 --> 37:12.429
Miles from the ocean.

37:12.431 --> 37:14.431
I somehow doubt your
"beauties" will appreciate

37:14.433 --> 37:17.734
Climbing up and down
a cliff each day.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.605
Let's go inside.

37:29.947 --> 37:32.315
(door closes)

37:33.284 --> 37:34.784
I'm sorry.
I know I said

37:34.786 --> 37:36.753
I'd try to be back
for the feast.

37:36.755 --> 37:38.288
Did you even try?

37:38.290 --> 37:39.289
Or were you happier

37:39.291 --> 37:41.491
Being away from me right now?

37:42.260 --> 37:44.527
I wish
you believed

37:44.529 --> 37:45.629
How sorry I am.

37:45.631 --> 37:48.298
I'm sorry that I
got in so deep

37:48.300 --> 37:49.532
With henry,
that I thought

37:49.534 --> 37:51.268
Of only my own survival.

37:51.270 --> 37:52.802
Sorry because
now that I know

37:52.804 --> 37:54.571
Real love,
I've disappointed you.

37:54.573 --> 37:56.940
I believe that you're sorry.

37:56.942 --> 37:59.743
I wish you could look at me
like you once did.

37:59.745 --> 38:01.444
I'm still the
same person,

38:01.446 --> 38:03.446
The same woman you loved.

38:03.448 --> 38:06.349
Tonight I saw a man killed
in front of me

38:06.351 --> 38:08.385
Because people thought
he was a monster.

38:08.387 --> 38:09.619
They knew one thing about him,

38:09.621 --> 38:11.621
And that was dark enough
that in their minds

38:11.623 --> 38:14.391
They erased him
as a human being.
They didn't wait

38:14.393 --> 38:16.026
To see the truth of his heart.

38:16.028 --> 38:18.395
I'm not sure
what it is you're saying...

38:18.397 --> 38:20.897
Or that I really like you
using the word "monster"

38:20.899 --> 38:22.732
When we were
just talking about <i>me.</i>

38:22.734 --> 38:25.568
(sighs)
I don't want to make
the same mistakes

38:25.570 --> 38:27.370
As those people tonight.

38:27.372 --> 38:28.805
I don't want
to kill

38:28.807 --> 38:30.740
Something out of ignorance.

38:30.742 --> 38:33.743
So does that mean
you're willing to forgive me?

38:33.745 --> 38:36.479
I mean that I want to see
your heart, kenna,

38:36.481 --> 38:38.481
And not just one part of it,

38:38.483 --> 38:40.884
The entire truth of it,
no matter how dark.

38:40.886 --> 38:43.086
Because that's what marriage
is all about.

38:43.088 --> 38:46.423
It can take years
to see what's inside.
Years?

38:46.425 --> 38:48.425
Bash, my heart really
isn't that complicated.

38:48.427 --> 38:51.361
Trust me, your heart
is complicated.

38:51.363 --> 38:54.764
It's like one of those
drinks at christmas
with too much spice.

38:54.766 --> 38:57.600
Nutmeg and ginger
and cinnamon and cloves.

38:57.602 --> 38:59.069
But what can I say?

38:59.071 --> 39:01.104
I've developed
a taste for spice.

39:01.106 --> 39:03.907
I can't imagine
doing without it.

39:07.745 --> 39:09.679
I love you, too.

39:13.451 --> 39:16.386
â™ª

39:17.355 --> 39:18.922
He's the one.

39:18.924 --> 39:20.490
Bash.

39:20.492 --> 39:21.925
He stabbed

39:21.927 --> 39:24.761
Our brother
on henry's orders.

39:24.763 --> 39:26.363
What are you going to do?

39:26.365 --> 39:27.630
Justice says he should suffer

39:27.632 --> 39:28.832
The way marcus suffered.

39:28.834 --> 39:30.767
He'll ache for death

39:30.769 --> 39:34.671
Long before that gift
is bestowed.

39:34.673 --> 39:37.507
(wind whistling)

39:37.509 --> 39:39.943
(bell tolling in distance)

39:39.945 --> 39:42.979
What can we possibly do

39:42.981 --> 39:45.482
Or say to convince elizabeth
that I'm not a threat?

39:45.484 --> 39:48.618
That I'm not seeking
to topple her?

39:49.553 --> 39:50.487
(sighs)

39:50.489 --> 39:52.956
There's nothing.

39:52.958 --> 39:55.825
For the rest of our lives,
she will distrust us.

39:55.827 --> 39:58.962
We can't explain
my actions to her
or anybody,

39:58.964 --> 40:01.464
Because every explanation
leads back to...

40:01.466 --> 40:02.532
The blackmail,

40:02.534 --> 40:04.000
The secret...

40:04.002 --> 40:06.536
To you killing your father.
I have awoken

40:06.538 --> 40:07.904
A sleeping dragon.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.140
We have to give the money
to navarre, of course.

40:10.142 --> 40:12.842
And we can't build
the chÃ¢teau for our
new beginning.

40:12.844 --> 40:13.977
That property
could never be defended

40:13.979 --> 40:15.078
In the way that we need.

40:16.881 --> 40:19.716
It's never going to end, is it?

40:19.718 --> 40:23.153
I'm not even going to have
the illusion of safety.

40:23.155 --> 40:25.855
I'll be looking
over my shoulder for her

40:25.857 --> 40:28.658
Every day of my life.
I know that
I can't undo

40:28.660 --> 40:30.727
My mistakes, but...

40:30.729 --> 40:34.097
I believe that
we will get past this.

40:34.099 --> 40:36.599
I thought so, too.

40:36.601 --> 40:38.001
But one thing
leads to another,

40:38.003 --> 40:40.570
Keeping it alive,
and when I look at you...

40:40.572 --> 40:42.939
I remember.

40:42.941 --> 40:45.842
It is torment,
francis, and I c...

40:45.844 --> 40:47.877
Can't do this anymore.
But separate lives

40:47.879 --> 40:50.447
Won't work for us.

40:50.449 --> 40:51.748
When I told you
that queens

40:51.750 --> 40:53.750
Don't have
the freedom of a king,

40:53.752 --> 40:55.585
I wasn't trying to control you.

40:55.587 --> 40:57.954
You were just telling me
the truth.

40:57.956 --> 41:00.690
What I am saying
is that I want you

41:00.692 --> 41:02.459
To be free.

41:02.461 --> 41:05.962
You can find love
with someone else.
(sighs)

41:05.964 --> 41:07.997
Kings have done it in the past.

41:07.999 --> 41:09.666
I don't want to be free.

41:09.668 --> 41:11.134
We've both
been pretending

41:11.136 --> 41:13.703
That we can make things
the way they were before.

41:13.705 --> 41:15.472
We both know that's impossible.

41:15.474 --> 41:18.875
It's just taken us
this long to admit it.

41:22.980 --> 41:26.216
How could you send me
to another?

41:26.218 --> 41:28.117
How?

41:31.055 --> 41:32.856
â™ª

41:32.858 --> 41:35.658
Because I love you.

41:35.660 --> 41:38.862
And one of us
should be happy.

41:38.864 --> 41:41.498
