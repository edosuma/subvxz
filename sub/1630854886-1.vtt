AVI:
Teddy McDonald,
he's just a contractor now.

00:15.440 --> 00:17.344
You might have to
find another way

00:17.444 --> 00:19.215
to connect all the dots,

00:19.315 --> 00:20.618
but I can help you do that.

00:20.718 --> 00:22.388
Sorry, Avi.

00:22.488 --> 00:25.127
I'm the only hope
you have to save Franklin.

I want to make sure
my family is safe,

Fuck.

00:39.756 --> 00:41.259
Empaca todo.
I do one more thing,

00:41.359 --> 00:42.261
then I come back.

00:42.361 --> 00:44.265
I got $13 million.

JEROME:
Franklin is family.

00:55.622 --> 00:58.159
But I'd like to think that
what you doing is just business,

00:58.260 --> 00:59.496
and I got your back,

00:59.596 --> 01:03.303
but I will not go to war
against my own blood.

01:03.403 --> 01:05.575
LOUIE:
I approached Teddy, made a deal

01:05.675 --> 01:07.344
to buy my cocaine
directly from him.

01:07.444 --> 01:08.681
You gonna shoot me?

01:08.781 --> 01:11.052
If it meant me getting
my fucking money back,

01:11.152 --> 01:12.589
I would kill you
ten times over.

01:12.689 --> 01:14.793
If anybody has any doubt
about what's about to happen,

01:14.893 --> 01:16.664
say it now.

01:19.168 --> 01:21.306
Relax. Jerome and Louie,

01:21.406 --> 01:23.209
they asked me...

01:27.552 --> 01:29.790
We gonna have to burn
this whole motherfucker

01:29.890 --> 01:31.694

01:55.508 --> 01:57.277
epidemic in this country,

not our children,

of interrogating us,

I remember you mentioning

an ex-boyfriend
of your mother's,

07:36.155 --> 07:39.896
how he used to move cocaine
from the Bahamas into Miami.

07:41.032 --> 07:42.769
You mean Randy?

07:43.704 --> 07:46.777
I could fly out
to the Caymans if I have to.

07:48.246 --> 07:49.716

07:49.816 --> 07:51.820
to keep the money
here in the States.

07:52.689 --> 07:54.759
And Miami...

07:54.859 --> 07:56.530
well, that's our best bet
for finding a bank

07:56.630 --> 07:58.801
that's willing to take
this money today.

08:00.538 --> 08:01.873
You shouldn't have done this.

08:01.973 --> 08:04.011
You could have sold
some of the buildings off.

08:04.111 --> 08:05.681
We could have gotten
legitimate loans.

08:05.781 --> 08:06.850
We would have lost
the downtown property.

08:06.950 --> 08:08.086
We could've built it
all back up.

08:08.186 --> 08:10.591
- V, you're not listening.
- We still could.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.060
Call Jerome and Louie,
you tell them...

08:12.160 --> 08:13.530
- Jerome and Louie?
- ...you made a mistake. Yes.

08:13.630 --> 08:15.000
This is done, okay?!

08:15.100 --> 08:17.538
Now, I need you to get
on board with what comes next.

08:17.638 --> 08:19.743

08:33.169 --> 08:35.708
Do you know somebody
that can help us,

another direction?

08:41.753 --> 08:44.559
You need to go

08:44.659 --> 08:46.830
Now get me the

09:03.329 --> 09:05.266
Still no record
he left the country.

09:05.366 --> 09:08.039
It could be
he used a fake passport.

09:08.139 --> 09:10.310
Or, despite what you heard,
he's still stateside.

09:10.410 --> 09:13.316

09:13.416 --> 09:15.120

fee of whatever's left

09:21.132 --> 09:23.136

09:37.431 --> 09:40.170
Remember Alton

09:40.270 --> 09:41.573
Yeah.

09:41.673 --> 09:43.744
You came up with
his pops in Kansas City

09:43.844 --> 09:46.315
and an ex-wife and kid in D. C.

09:47.184 --> 09:50.791

to reconfirm their locations

09:50.891 --> 09:52.829
find me
any other pressure points

09:52.929 --> 09:54.632
he might have in his life.

09:57.370 --> 09:59.174

10:00.310 --> 10:01.880
Last time
we went down this road,

10:01.980 --> 10:04.184
it didn't turn out
too good for the old man.

10:04.284 --> 10:05.654
Listen, if you got
a problem with this shit,

10:05.754 --> 10:07.592

12:16.850 --> 12:19.221
Avi had a lot of enemies.

12:19.321 --> 12:21.191
People wanted him gone,
so you tell me who they were,

12:21.292 --> 12:23.062
and I can use my resources
to narrow it down,

12:23.162 --> 12:25.099
and we will find out
who did this.

12:28.974 --> 12:30.209
You know what the worst thing

12:30.310 --> 12:31.913
about losing
half your hearing is?

12:32.013 --> 12:33.884
It's your balance.

12:33.984 --> 12:35.286
The inner ear

12:35.386 --> 12:37.825
regulates your equilibrium,
and without it,

12:37.925 --> 12:39.495
it's hard to stay centered.

12:39.596 --> 12:42.768
So, for instance...
(speaks Hebrew)

12:42.868 --> 12:45.106
If, uh...

12:45.206 --> 12:46.810

12:46.910 --> 12:49.081
for what you did to me,

12:49.181 --> 12:51.218
I can't promise you

12:51.318 --> 12:55.761
that I would fire the gun
where I wish.

12:59.969 --> 13:01.539
Bang.

13:04.411 --> 13:06.382

we live our lives...

Did Teddy call the house
last night or this morning?

14:44.044 --> 14:45.413
What? No.

14:45.514 --> 14:48.052
Did you talk to him?
Does he know that I was gone?

14:48.152 --> 14:49.655
No, I didn't talk to him.

14:49.756 --> 14:51.091
Okay.

14:51.191 --> 14:52.528
But if he's been
listening in on us,

14:52.628 --> 14:54.164
he'll know that
you weren't home.

14:54.264 --> 14:55.901
It wasn't Teddy
who's been listening.

14:57.270 --> 14:59.207

we ain't got access

16:37.671 --> 16:39.474
Franklin found out
Avi's missing.

16:39.575 --> 16:42.748
It's got him spooked.
Was that you?

19:16.823 --> 19:19.829

Uncle Rome.

19:20.964 --> 19:24.237
Makes sense.
Know y'all are close.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.210
Probably gave you a pretty
good deal, too, right?

19:27.310 --> 19:28.913
12 a key?

19:29.849 --> 19:34.190
Thing is,
well, I can give you
the same product for ten.

19:34.290 --> 19:35.861
Ten?

19:38.533 --> 19:39.769
Same shit?

19:40.570 --> 19:42.440
Same shit.

19:42.541 --> 19:44.578
That's an extra
$200,000 in your pocket

19:44.678 --> 19:46.516
for every 100 keys you move.

19:47.918 --> 19:50.657
Hey, his motherfucking math
check out?

19:50.757 --> 19:52.761
It does.

19:52.861 --> 19:54.832
Pretty good, huh?

19:54.932 --> 19:57.504
Nigga, the price is right

19:57.604 --> 19:59.775
(chuckles) Shit.

19:59.875 --> 20:01.411
But hear me, cuz.

20:01.512 --> 20:02.715
I ain't trying to get
in the middle

20:02.815 --> 20:04.919

20:05.019 --> 20:07.190

20:07.290 --> 20:08.760
And you won't.

20:08.860 --> 20:10.864
Look, it's not personal,
it's business.

20:10.964 --> 20:12.801
Jerome understands that.

20:14.337 --> 20:15.607
Look, I tell you what.

20:15.707 --> 20:18.680
I'll send the girls by
tonight with ten bird.

20:18.780 --> 20:20.617
You ain't gonna do better
than ten a key.

20:20.717 --> 20:22.420
Might as well
pick it up, right?

20:22.521 --> 20:25.594
Next time you see Jerome,
tell him you got a better deal.

20:25.694 --> 20:27.531
Give him a chance to beat it.

20:27.631 --> 20:30.537
If he can, then, shit,
continue to buy from him.

20:30.637 --> 20:33.475
No hard feelings.
But if not, well...

20:33.576 --> 20:36.983
$200,000 buy you
any car you want, huh?

20:39.320 --> 20:40.590
Yeah.

20:40.690 --> 20:42.460
Let me know.

20:58.092 --> 20:58.793
I told you,

20:58.893 --> 21:01.331
took Cedro to the ER.

21:01.431 --> 21:02.835
That was 24 hours ago.

21:02.935 --> 21:05.807
Yeah, we waited for a pinche
doctor the whole night.

21:05.907 --> 21:08.713
You never had a night
like that with your son?

21:08.813 --> 21:10.817
You should've called.
We have problems.

21:16.562 --> 21:18.398
So I got Detective Han

21:18.500 --> 21:21.572
checking the jails
and calling the hospitals.

21:21.672 --> 21:23.375
So far, there's nothing.

21:24.077 --> 21:26.348
Yo
u really think
someone took her?

21:28.786 --> 21:31.057
Who would do that?

21:31.158 --> 21:32.694
I don't know.

21:32.795 --> 21:34.698
It's not thugs.
These people are trained.

21:34.799 --> 21:37.036
They would know how
to extract information.

21:38.907 --> 21:42.280
Pinche cara de topo
enfermo que traes, cabrón.

21:42.380 --> 21:44.618
Have you slept?

21:45.854 --> 21:46.856
I don't need sleep.

21:46.956 --> 21:48.860
I need to find her.

22:08.098 --> 22:10.336

22:10.436 --> 22:11.839
Shit took a turn.

22:11.939 --> 22:14.444
He had to be sedated again.

22:15.580 --> 22:17.350
Kane's a warrior.

22:17.450 --> 22:18.753
He'll be all right.

22:18.853 --> 22:21.057
Is that right?

22:21.859 --> 22:24.632
Look, I wanted you
to hear it from me.

22:24.732 --> 22:27.638
Leon's out. Left the country.

22:27.738 --> 22:29.608
I know you was
buying from him.

22:29.708 --> 22:32.380
I want you to know
I'm-a step up, take his place.

22:32.480 --> 22:34.785
No, this ain't the time.
I mean, fuck.

22:34.885 --> 22:38.025

he in there to begin with.

22:38.125 --> 22:41.064
I hear you,
and I am sorry. Truly.

22:41.164 --> 22:43.335
But if you want
to hurt Jerome and Louie,

22:43.435 --> 22:45.774
there's a few ways to do it,
but a big one

22:45.874 --> 22:48.478
is to fuck with they business.

22:48.580 --> 22:51.451
So let me know when
you want to talk, all right?

22:51.552 --> 22:53.623

23:22.714 --> 23:24.083
Okay, what's going on?

23:24.183 --> 23:26.822
LOUIE:
Like I said,
we just want to re-up.

23:26.923 --> 23:28.091
Oh, yeah,
you canceled your honeymoon

23:28.191 --> 23:29.795
just to stay here
and sling dope?

23:30.697 --> 23:32.801
You
want to sell product,
we want to buy product.

23:32.901 --> 23:34.103
Why's it got to be
more than that?

23:34.203 --> 23:35.840
Okay, so here's the thing.
You can tell me

23:35.941 --> 23:37.577
what's going on here,
or I promise you,

23:37.678 --> 23:39.949
this will be the last time
that we do business together.

23:42.654 --> 23:44.190
We were robbed.

23:44.290 --> 23:45.493
By who?

23:45.594 --> 23:46.629
Franklin.

23:46.729 --> 23:47.998
Franklin robbed you?

23:48.098 --> 23:50.837
Yeah, somebody cleaned him
out, all his accounts.

23:50.937 --> 23:53.743
He needed a life raft.
Apparently we were it.

23:59.555 --> 24:02.861
I'll have, uh, Gustavo
give you the bricks.

24:02.961 --> 24:04.732
- Will 300 do it?
- Yeah,

24:04.832 --> 24:07.470
but he also hit
our cash reserves,

24:07.571 --> 24:10.042
so I'm-a need those
on consignment.

24:13.015 --> 24:14.585
Yeah, you're good for it.

24:16.555 --> 24:19.561
What's gonna happen now
between you and Franklin?

24:20.697 --> 24:22.801
I don't know, but I'm guessing

24:22.901 --> 24:25.172
we're not spending
Christmas together.

24:35.927 --> 24:38.966
(footfalls on broken glass)

24:54.130 --> 24:58.171
Remember, back on Catalina,
what I told you?

24:58.271 --> 25:01.077
The things I've done
to make this money?

25:01.177 --> 25:03.081
Yes.

25:03.181 --> 25:05.520
So you can imagine,
after all of that,

25:05.620 --> 25:08.493
starting back at zero?

25:08.593 --> 25:09.595
That ain't gonna happen.

25:09.695 --> 25:10.764
That's on you.

25:10.864 --> 25:13.068
But this right here,

25:13.168 --> 25:14.671
this isn't what
I signed up for.

25:14.772 --> 25:17.143
I know.

25:17.243 --> 25:18.913
You know?

25:19.013 --> 25:20.750
You were supposed to be out.

25:20.850 --> 25:24.023
Now, I've worked so hard
to leave my old life behind me,

25:24.123 --> 25:26.061
but you're standing here,
asking me

25:26.161 --> 25:27.998
to go launder
millions of dollars

25:28.098 --> 25:29.935
in stolen drug money?

25:30.035 --> 25:31.639
Do you understand
what that means?

25:31.739 --> 25:33.208
I don't do it lightly.

25:33.308 --> 25:35.880
- You don't do it lightly?
- I don't.

25:35.980 --> 25:37.551
That's great.

25:38.218 --> 25:39.922
But this, right now...

25:40.557 --> 25:43.195
...this is about survival.

25:43.295 --> 25:45.700
What happens
in the next few weeks

25:45.800 --> 25:49.575
is gonna determine the course
of the rest of our lives,

25:49.675 --> 25:52.079
and our baby's.

25:54.651 --> 25:56.589
Please, V.

25:56.689 --> 25:58.559
Please.

26:00.897 --> 26:02.099
JEROME:
And what'd you tell him?

26:02.199 --> 26:04.571
That I'd talk to you.

26:04.671 --> 26:07.076
Why I reached out.

26:07.176 --> 26:09.147
You know
I'd rather buy from you,

26:09.247 --> 26:12.086
but you just gonna have to
get it down to ten a key.

26:13.990 --> 26:17.129
O.G., you know why he's able
to sell you them birds so
cheap?

26:19.400 --> 26:21.237
Stole 'em from us.

26:23.408 --> 26:25.780
Look, like I told your
little motherfucking nephew,

26:25.880 --> 26:28.051
I ain't trying to get in the
middle of no family shit.

26:28.151 --> 26:30.155
I'm just trying
to get my bread.

26:33.830 --> 26:36.134
You already cop them keys?

26:36.234 --> 26:38.639
Them two little bitches
supposed to bring 'em by tonight.

26:39.407 --> 26:42.313
Hey, l
ook, you know
I'd rather buy from you.

26:43.348 --> 26:45.152
If not,

26:45.252 --> 26:47.624
you know it ain't personal.

26:48.458 --> 26:50.295
Nigga got to do
what he got to do.

26:50.395 --> 26:51.632
Yeah.

27:04.056 --> 27:05.325
How much did

27:05.425 --> 27:07.029
- and the operation?
- Nothing that can hurt us.

27:07.764 --> 27:10.770
But, look, regardless
of who is doing this,

27:10.870 --> 27:13.241
Avi's entire operation
is burned,

27:13.341 --> 27:17.016
so, unless you want to shut
the entire pipeline down,

27:17.116 --> 27:18.820
we're gonna need
another gun connect.

27:18.920 --> 27:22.928
I'm sure we have ideas,
if that would be helpful.

27:25.399 --> 27:28.338
Is there any word
from the higher-ups?

27:28.438 --> 27:30.844
About the money, my ask?

27:31.477 --> 27:33.850
Let's get this all cleared up,

27:33.950 --> 27:36.989
then we'll talk about getting
you your blue badge back.

27:37.089 --> 27:38.926
Yeah.

27:40.229 --> 27:41.832
I got to get
the mud off my shoes

27:41.932 --> 27:44.638
before I step foot
on Langley's carpets.

27:47.076 --> 27:48.111
(clears throat)

27:48.211 --> 27:50.215
There is significant interest

27:50.315 --> 27:52.319
in the assets
in your possession.

27:52.419 --> 27:54.223
But, yes, we need to
make sure you're clean

27:54.323 --> 27:56.027
before you're
officially welcomed back

27:56.127 --> 27:57.764
inside the walls.

27:59.400 --> 28:03.408
Yeah, I reckon $73 million
cleans a lot of carpet.

28:03.509 --> 28:05.747
(door opens and closes
in distance)

28:05.847 --> 28:09.186
As far back as I can remember,
I wanted to be

28:09.287 --> 28:10.422
in the CIA.

28:10.523 --> 28:12.226
My father and brother were
Army men--

28:12.326 --> 28:15.265
instruments of policy,
blunt objects--

28:15.365 --> 28:17.804
and I just wanted
a seat at the table

28:17.904 --> 28:21.244
where the long arc
of history is shaped.

28:21.344 --> 28:24.217
(footfalls approaching)

28:24.885 --> 28:27.156
- (
knock on door)
- (clears throat)

28:31.297 --> 28:33.168
I understand.

28:45.894 --> 28:48.265
Franklin is going to war
with Louie and Jerome.

28:48.365 --> 28:53.174
This... fucking family, man.

28:54.076 --> 28:55.479
It
's like they don't even
have the good sense

28:55.580 --> 28:57.149
not to tear each other apart.

28:57.249 --> 29:00.757
(door opens and closes
in distance)

29:00.857 --> 29:02.994
You need anything
else from me?

29:03.829 --> 29:07.202
No, you should go home.
(clears throat)

29:07.303 --> 29:09.006
Okay.

29:09.106 --> 29:10.008
Oh, Gus.

29:10.108 --> 29:12.012
So, I...

29:12.847 --> 29:16.054
...
...never really said
I'm sorry about Cedro

29:16.154 --> 29:19.795
getting hurt and the hospital
making you wait all night.

29:19.895 --> 29:22.299
It's unbelievable.
What was the hospital?

29:23.134 --> 29:25.105
Verdugo Hills.

29:25.707 --> 29:28.111
Well, I say, uh, anything
ever happens to the two of us,

29:28.211 --> 29:30.516
let's not go to Verdugo Hills,
you know what I mean?

29:30.617 --> 29:32.286
(chuckles)

29:33.923 --> 29:35.359
(knocks)

29:36.194 --> 29:39.333
(airplane landing)

30:03.315 --> 30:04.951
V?

30:08.058 --> 30:09.126
What's this?

30:09.226 --> 30:10.462
What?

30:10.563 --> 30:13.502
This is the woman
who goes to Miami to deposit

30:13.602 --> 30:15.540
stolen drug money. (laughs)

30:15.640 --> 30:17.443
You have something for me?

30:17.544 --> 30:20.850
Uh, yeah. It's
in the back seat.

30:21.618 --> 30:23.923
It's $1.85 million.

30:24.591 --> 30:26.895
I'll be back by
dinner tomorrow.

30:30.970 --> 30:32.373
I love you.

30:34.911 --> 30:36.414
Yeah, you do.

30:48.539 --> 30:51.945
BUCKLEY:
Well, officially LAPD
has jack shit.

30:52.046 --> 30:56.120
You're just the victims
of some unfortunate violence.

30:56.220 --> 30:58.425
And unofficially?

30:59.293 --> 31:01.865
You about to be
the flavor of the month.

31:03.201 --> 31:04.871
They know it's drug-related,

31:04.971 --> 31:07.544
that you got
ties to Franklin Saint,

31:07.644 --> 31:10.516
so you're gonna need
to tighten up your shit.

31:10.616 --> 31:12.520
JEROME:
Ain't that what we pay you
for?

31:12.620 --> 31:13.989
Keep motherfuckers
off our back?

31:14.090 --> 31:15.425
Yeah, well, it's not
gonna be that easy

31:15.526 --> 31:17.429
now that I'm officially
off LAPD payroll.

31:17.530 --> 31:20.268
But you still have
friends on the force, right?

31:20.368 --> 31:22.306
Yeah, I still got
a few of those.

31:22.406 --> 31:24.176
JEROME:
So keep 'em close.

31:24.276 --> 31:26.214
And you keep your mind right.

31:26.314 --> 31:27.917
Stay off that fucking powder.

31:28.017 --> 31:29.453
Goddamn junkie.

31:29.554 --> 31:31.491
(pager beeps)

31:37.336 --> 31:38.906
Give us a minute.

31:44.283 --> 31:45.920
Finally, this motherfucker.

31:46.020 --> 31:47.590
(dial tone)

31:51.330 --> 31:52.934
(line ringing)

31:53.034 --> 31:54.136
(phone rings)

31:55.740 --> 31:56.909
Unc.

31:57.009 --> 31:58.178
JEROME:
Been paging you all day.

31:58.278 --> 32:00.683
Yeah, I've been busy, man.

32:03.421 --> 32:05.091
Need to meet up.

32:05.192 --> 32:06.427
What for?

32:07.262 --> 32:08.499
Nigga.

32:10.135 --> 32:12.106
I didn't want things
to go this way.

32:12.206 --> 32:14.978
I went to Louie
and asked for help.

32:15.078 --> 32:17.517
Oh, you gonna
blame it all on us now?

32:18.552 --> 32:20.088
Your wife went behind my back

32:20.188 --> 32:22.426
and stole the plug,
and that's business.

32:23.094 --> 32:27.269
But I show up and take back
what I made you, and it's
theft?

32:27.904 --> 32:29.641
<i>So it's busi</i> ness
<i>when I'm bending over,</i>

32:29.741 --> 32:30.977
but it's personal
when you getting it.

32:31.077 --> 32:32.647
Is that how that works, huh?

32:32.747 --> 32:35.018
Nephew, if you don't
bring back what you stole,

32:35.118 --> 32:38.258
you gonna understand
how this work, little nigga.

32:38.358 --> 32:40.462
You want to come after me,
that's fine.

32:42.232 --> 32:45.940
Came into this shit
with my eyes open.

32:46.708 --> 32:49.113
And they still are, nigga.

32:49.213 --> 32:51.417
(dial tone)

32:55.125 --> 32:56.460
(dial tone stops)

33:01.270 --> 33:02.674
Hmm.

33:11.424 --> 33:13.228
(sighs)

33:15.198 --> 33:16.602
Listen.

33:18.271 --> 33:21.477
There's something else you
need to know about last night.

33:23.047 --> 33:26.622
After I refused
to help Franklin get to Teddy,

33:26.722 --> 33:29.159
he pulled a gun on me.

33:30.462 --> 33:33.134
Said he was gonna kill me.

33:34.236 --> 33:38.044
He might've done it, too,
if Buckley hadn't been there.

33:41.450 --> 33:44.189
I heard you when you said

33:44.290 --> 33:46.762
you didn't want to go to war
with your family.

33:49.668 --> 33:52.039
I tried to respect it.

33:53.441 --> 33:57.584
But you need to know
exactly who we dealing with.

34:18.726 --> 34:20.630
It was either this,

34:20.730 --> 34:21.798
or drop them off first

34:21.899 --> 34:23.368
and have you waiting
even longer.

34:25.272 --> 34:28.144
Or you could just give us
the location to the safe house

34:28.244 --> 34:30.315
and save us all
a whole lot of time.

34:31.183 --> 34:33.288
Stuff's in the trunk.

34:35.760 --> 34:39.233
What's up, y'all?
My name's Franklin.

34:40.168 --> 34:42.807
Ar
e you the one Mama's
always complaining about?

34:44.844 --> 34:47.149
Probably, yeah.

34:47.249 --> 34:49.086
Want a French fry?

34:49.186 --> 34:51.090
FRANKLIN:
Sure, I'll have one of them.

34:54.564 --> 34:56.334
Damn, that was good.

34:56.434 --> 34:58.304
(laughs)

35:02.412 --> 35:04.818
You're not gonna take 'em
to the drop, are you?

35:04.918 --> 35:06.688
Yeah, we just gonna
leave 'em in the back seat

35:06.788 --> 35:08.491
with a Etch A Sketch.

35:16.808 --> 35:18.846
(telephone ringing)

35:21.852 --> 35:24.456
McDonald.
(grunts)

35:24.557 --> 35:26.528
(siren wailing)

35:30.569 --> 35:32.874
(indistinct chatter)

35:38.619 --> 35:40.388
OFFICER:
Come on, let's go.

35:40.488 --> 35:43.227
I'm looking
for Detective Parosa.

35:43.962 --> 35:46.334
(indistinct chatter)

35:47.970 --> 35:51.444
- (door clangs)
- (lock buzzes)

36:02.332 --> 36:03.736
What took you so long?

36:03.836 --> 36:07.844
(lock buzzes)

36:15.258 --> 36:17.462
(baby crying in distance)

36:26.915 --> 36:29.954
(dog barking)

36:30.656 --> 36:32.827
TONY:
The fuck you doing here?

36:43.582 --> 36:45.920
Uh, make sure
he wasn't followed.

36:48.926 --> 36:50.563
We went over this.

36:50.663 --> 36:52.667
There are protocols
if you need to meet.

36:52.767 --> 36:53.769
Can't just show up.

36:53.869 --> 36:55.873
Yeah. Uh, I forgot

36:55.973 --> 36:58.679
to tell you I told Teddy,
um, we took

36:58.779 --> 36:59.948
Cedro to the emergency room.

37:00.048 --> 37:01.718
TONY:
You're worried he's gonna
check?

37:01.818 --> 37:02.820
Worried, mis huevos.

37:02.920 --> 37:05.425
I know he will.

37:05.526 --> 37:07.229
But, uh, hospital records
aren't easy to get,

37:07.329 --> 37:09.801
even for
an intelligence officer.

37:09.901 --> 37:10.936
We'll take care of it
right away.

37:11.036 --> 37:12.540
Right away when? Tonight?

37:12.640 --> 37:13.809
As soon as possible.

37:13.909 --> 37:15.813
Did you tell him
a particular hospital?

37:15.913 --> 37:17.382
Yeah, Verdugo Hills.

37:17.482 --> 37:18.919
I'll take care of it, okay?

37:19.019 --> 37:21.825
But, Gustavo, listen to me.

37:21.925 --> 37:23.996
Informants who do
what we tell them,

37:24.096 --> 37:25.599
they make it out alive.

37:25.699 --> 37:28.271
It's the ones
who get flustered, panic,

37:28.371 --> 37:31.645
and don't follow protocol
that get into trouble.

37:33.414 --> 37:35.986
I had a long talk
with my bosses today,

37:36.086 --> 37:38.324
and they want to see
something now

37:38.424 --> 37:39.861
to justify what
we're doing here.

37:39.961 --> 37:42.466
You mentioned
a tunnel at the border,

37:42.567 --> 37:44.504
how you're bringing
the cocaine across.

37:45.573 --> 37:47.309
I want to see it.

37:47.977 --> 37:48.912
When?

37:49.012 --> 37:50.482
Soon as possible.

37:50.583 --> 37:53.622
Tomorrow, if it doesn't
raise any alarm bells.

37:53.722 --> 37:55.325
That a problem?

37:56.728 --> 37:57.997
No, should be okay.

37:58.097 --> 38:00.301
All right.

38:00.401 --> 38:01.872
Go home, get some rest.

38:02.507 --> 38:05.011
You promise me you're gonn a
take care of this, right?

38:05.111 --> 38:08.284
Absolutely. Good night.

38:17.102 --> 38:20.341
I held back,
but Ruben's impatient.

38:20.976 --> 38:23.381
He wants to meet tomorrow.

38:28.357 --> 38:30.563
What happened to burning
all this down to the ground?

38:30.663 --> 38:32.600
(sighs)

38:33.702 --> 38:37.008
We about to side with
the Russians, commit treason.

38:37.108 --> 38:39.881
Forgive me
if I need a minute to think

38:39.981 --> 38:41.450
before lighting the match.

38:41.551 --> 38:44.423
You still believe, don't you?

38:45.693 --> 38:48.899
Even after all of this,
you want so badly

38:48.999 --> 38:51.905
to think America
still cares about you,

38:52.005 --> 38:53.575
like some orphan child,

38:53.675 --> 38:55.411
standing by the door,
waiting for Mama to come home,

38:55.513 --> 38:57.650
no matter
how long she's been gone.

38:57.750 --> 38:59.921
We throw our lot in
with the KGB now,

39:00.021 --> 39:02.827
we may have to face the
reality that we have to leave.

39:02.927 --> 39:05.331
Face the reality?

39:06.668 --> 39:08.404
(scoffing)

39:11.410 --> 39:13.949
Let me tell you
something, Franklin.

39:14.049 --> 39:16.387
Those hours, days and weeks

39:16.487 --> 39:18.592
after your father
disappeared in Cuba...

39:19.226 --> 39:22.432
...were so
me of
the worst of my life.

39:22.533 --> 39:25.004
I was completely alone
in a foreign country.

39:25.104 --> 39:26.675
Didn't even speak
the fucking language.

39:26.775 --> 39:28.344
Didn't know
what happened to him,

39:28.444 --> 39:30.048
but knew almost for certain

39:30.148 --> 39:31.718
I'd never see him again.

39:32.485 --> 39:36.828
And if the p ain
and frustration weren't
enough,

39:36.928 --> 39:40.134
there was always the fear

39:40.235 --> 39:43.508
that at any moment
they could come and get me, too.

39:43.609 --> 39:45.713
It went on like
that for months

39:45.813 --> 39:47.148
until one night,

39:47.249 --> 39:50.856
I realized why
Teddy let me live.

39:50.956 --> 39:53.094
It wasn't a moral decision

39:53.194 --> 39:54.363
or even convenience.

39:54.463 --> 39:57.536
He could've killed me
and gotten away with it. Mm
- mm.

39:57.637 --> 40:01.410
Teddy spared my life
because, in his mind,

40:01.511 --> 40:03.815
I posed no threat to him.

40:03.916 --> 40:06.387
None of us do.

40:06.487 --> 40:07.723
He could take away

40:07.823 --> 40:10.596
one of the most
important things in my life,

40:10.696 --> 40:12.733
and I could do
nothing about it.

40:12.833 --> 40:16.541
I was just some nigger
who'd never touch him,

40:16.641 --> 40:18.679
inconsequential
to the point it wasn't even

40:18.779 --> 40:22.419
worth the effort
it would take to snuff me out.

40:22.520 --> 40:25.124
And in that moment, I knew.

40:25.224 --> 40:27.597
Fuck Teddy, fuck the CIA,

40:27.697 --> 40:30.703
and fuck the government
that supported them.

40:30.803 --> 40:33.007
I was gonna do
whatever it would take

40:33.107 --> 40:34.744
to not only destroy him

40:34.844 --> 40:38.017
but to make sure that
he knew it was me,

40:38.117 --> 40:40.623
the inconsequential nigga
who did it.

40:40.723 --> 40:43.895
I am way past
facing reality, Franklin.

40:43.996 --> 40:46.166
I am done standing
by the door,

40:46.266 --> 40:47.870
waiting for Mama to come home.

40:47.970 --> 40:50.509
Now are you with me, Saint?

40:50.609 --> 40:52.747
Or are you with them?

40:56.186 --> 40:58.592
Okay.

41:01.665 --> 41:04.537
Okay, tell Ruben
I'll meet him tomorrow.

41:26.280 --> 41:28.819
(hip-hop playing
over car stereo)

41:39.239 --> 41:40.943
(engine shuts
off, music stops)

42:11.871 --> 42:13.107
Hey.

42:13.742 --> 42:17.082
I got a question
I've been meaning to ask you.

42:17.182 --> 42:18.585
What's that?

42:18.685 --> 42:21.624
I know little bitches
got little coochies,

42:21.725 --> 42:24.029
but I ain't never been
mountain climbing before,

42:24.129 --> 42:26.300
so I don't know if big bitches

42:26.400 --> 42:28.739
got big coochies or not.

42:29.406 --> 42:32.045
Why don't
you fuck
your mama and find out?

42:32.145 --> 42:33.247
- (men laughing)
- Ooh.

42:33.347 --> 42:35.284
You got a little
fight in you. All right.

42:35.384 --> 42:36.621
DALLAS:
We good.

42:36.721 --> 42:39.660
BIG D:
(chuckles) I bet we are.

42:39.761 --> 42:41.163
That thing scenting like some
bread fresh out the oven.

42:41.263 --> 42:43.000
Shut the fuck up, nigga.

42:44.704 --> 42:46.741
Get home safe.

42:48.177 --> 42:50.816
Mountain-climbing
motherfucker.

42:50.916 --> 42:51.985
(laughter)

42:52.085 --> 42:53.087
(Dallas laughs mockingly)

42:54.690 --> 42:56.728
Would you?

42:56.828 --> 42:58.063
'Cause of Franklin
and these hours,

42:58.164 --> 42:59.734
- I ain't had no dick in weeks.
- (chuckles)

42:59.834 --> 43:01.303
And he look like
he probably holding.

43:01.403 --> 43:02.338
You know who I
think is holding?

43:02.439 --> 43:04.042
Dallas, do not say it.

43:04.142 --> 43:06.180
(laughs) I got a peek once.

43:06.280 --> 43:09.019
You know, he be wearing
them tight jeans, they light.

43:09.119 --> 43:10.154
- Dallas.
- Ooh.

43:10.254 --> 43:11.724
Stop. He's our boss,

43:11.825 --> 43:13.260
and his lady's pregnant.

43:13.360 --> 43:14.630
That ain't got
shit to do with me.

43:14.730 --> 43:16.734
I would tear his ass up.

43:16.835 --> 43:18.905
(police siren whoops)

43:19.005 --> 43:20.809
Fuck.

43:20.909 --> 43:22.580
BLACK DIAMOND:
We ain't got no product
in the car,

43:22.680 --> 43:23.882
and they can't
legally search the car.

43:23.982 --> 43:25.619
DALLAS:
Since when the fuck "legal"

43:25.719 --> 43:27.155
got anything to do with it?

43:33.768 --> 43:35.639
Stay cool, you hear me?

43:35.739 --> 43:38.110
They want to
search the car, we let 'em.

43:38.210 --> 43:39.379
Have Franklin call the lawyer.

43:39.479 --> 43:41.316
Keep your hands
where we can see them

43:41.416 --> 43:42.820
and step out of the car.

43:42.920 --> 43:44.322
Ain't you gonna
tell us what we did wrong?

43:44.422 --> 43:45.959
I said step out
of the car now.

43:46.059 --> 43:47.328
Hey, fuck you.
We ain't got to do shit.

43:47.428 --> 43:49.299
OFFICER 2:
Out of the car now!

43:49.399 --> 43:51.069
Out of the car!

43:54.944 --> 43:56.981
BUCKLEY:
Ain't gonna tell you again.

43:59.452 --> 44:00.956
Nigga, you not even
a cop no more.

44:01.056 --> 44:03.662
Yeah, which should
scare you more than if I was.

44:05.766 --> 44:08.370
All right, we coming out.

44:13.815 --> 44:15.686
BUCKLEY:
Open the trunk.

44:15.786 --> 44:16.888
You have no right...

44:16.988 --> 44:19.426
Does it look like
I'm fucking asking?

44:20.461 --> 44:21.931
Open it.

44:29.814 --> 44:31.751
(unzipping and zipping bags)

44:35.826 --> 44:37.997
Don't move.

44:58.872 --> 45:02.111
Where Franklin
keeping my shit at?

45:04.282 --> 45:05.886
He stole from me.

45:06.754 --> 45:08.123
I want it back.

45:08.224 --> 45:09.994
Now where is it?

45:10.094 --> 45:13.000
We don't know, motherfucker.

45:13.100 --> 45:14.770
JEROME:
You think I'm playing with
you?

45:14.870 --> 45:15.772
We don't know.

45:15.872 --> 45:17.242
He got it someplace new.

45:17.342 --> 45:19.246
He ain't tell us where it is.

45:19.346 --> 45:20.983
- Gonna steal on you.
- Wha...?

45:21.618 --> 45:23.788
- (grunts)
- DALLAS: Fucker.

45:23.888 --> 45:25.157
JEROME:
It's gonna get bad

45:25.258 --> 45:27.395
for you in a hurry if you
don't tell me what I want to know.

45:27.496 --> 45:28.865
I swear, he didn't tell us.

45:28.965 --> 45:30.736
OFFICER: Everybody back.
Stay right there.

45:30.836 --> 45:32.438
BLACK DIAMOND:
He didn't tell us.

45:32.539 --> 45:34.276
He didn't tell us
where it is. He didn't...

45:34.376 --> 45:35.879
- (spectators gasp)
- Hey!
- DALLAS: Bitch-ass nigga,

45:35.979 --> 45:37.148
- she's telling the truth!
- Stay back.

45:37.248 --> 45:38.250
She's telling the truth!

45:38.350 --> 45:39.787
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes!

45:39.887 --> 45:42.025
Hey, stop fucking hitting her!
We don't know!

45:42.125 --> 45:44.362
You tell me where
my goddamn money at!

45:44.462 --> 45:45.933
DALLAS:
Fucking stop.

45:46.901 --> 45:48.905
Stop fucking hitting her!

45:49.005 --> 45:51.443
You can stop this all now.

45:51.544 --> 45:53.047
You tell me where it's at.

45:54.215 --> 45:56.086
- We don't know.
- MAN: This is bullshit.

45:56.186 --> 45:58.825
- Get the fuck back!
- DALLAS: She doesn't
know where it is.

45:58.925 --> 46:00.428
He didn't tell us.

46:00.529 --> 46:04.035
We don't know!

46:04.670 --> 46:07.308
She got a fucking
kid, man.
Stop hitting her.

46:13.588 --> 46:15.959
(crying)

46:21.336 --> 46:22.472
WOMAN:
Damn.

46:22.573 --> 46:24.209
(sniffles)

46:24.309 --> 46:26.213
I want my money.

46:26.313 --> 46:29.085
("Walk On By" by Isaac Hayes
playing)

46:29.185 --> 46:32.058
You tell Franklin
that I did this

46:32.158 --> 46:35.197
and I ain't gonna stop
till I get all that's mine.

46:37.536 --> 46:40.141
