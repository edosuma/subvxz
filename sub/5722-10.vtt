00:11.605 --> 00:13.171
It's a testing chamber.

00:13.173 --> 00:14.339
It measures and records

00:14.341 --> 00:16.008
the efficiency of the sarin.

00:16.010 --> 00:18.243
We'll each have one of these

it's Allah's will.

00:26.887 --> 00:28.754

If Allison Carr is
a Russian agent,

01:07.061 --> 01:08.827
you've got as much
to lose as we do.

01:08.829 --> 01:10.662
Arguably more.

01:10.664 --> 01:12.431
Aim is to deliver
proof of her treason.

01:12.433 --> 01:14.766
Well, the BND is not gonna
humor us much longer.

01:14.768 --> 01:17.069
If we don't drive her
into the arms of her handler,

01:17.071 --> 01:18.670
and soon,
all bets are off.

01:18.672 --> 01:19.838
She's on the move.

01:26.780 --> 01:29.147
- Look.
- Who's that?

01:29.149 --> 01:31.016
It's Ivan Krupin,

01:31.018 --> 01:32.417
SVR Berlin Station Chief.

01:32.419 --> 01:34.419
Send in the arrest teams now.

01:37.358 --> 01:39.091
We're done, Allison.

01:39.093 --> 01:40.692
We fucking lost.

01:40.694 --> 01:42.127
No, we have not.

01:42.129 --> 01:44.863
Now, listen to me
very carefully.

01:47.701 --> 01:50.435
They just brought her in.
She's in Interrogation 2.

I've been getting my intel

01:52.506 --> 01:54.840

01:54.842 --> 01:57.976
It's been Ivan all along.

She's lying, clearly.

04:38.705 --> 04:40.038
Is she?

04:40.040 --> 04:42.340
You don't run
to a Russian safe house

04:42.342 --> 04:45.610
to bring your Russian agent
in from the cold.

04:45.612 --> 04:48.713
I'm not sure there's a rule book
one is obliged to follow.

04:48.715 --> 04:50.282
It defies logic.

04:50.284 --> 04:51.950
She sabotaged your
Syrian operation, Dar.

04:51.952 --> 04:53.885
What more do you want?

04:53.887 --> 04:55.520
Proof.

04:55.522 --> 04:58.857
Well, how else
do you explain Lebanon?

04:58.859 --> 05:00.525
The ambush of Peter Quinn?

05:00.527 --> 05:02.360
The disappearance
of Ahmed Nazari?

05:02.362 --> 05:05.797
I can't, but the fact is
Ivan Krupin's in the next room,

05:05.799 --> 05:07.365
and he's singing
like a songbird.

05:07.367 --> 05:08.833
He's not a defector!

05:08.835 --> 05:11.703
We fabricated that story
to flush Allison out!

05:11.705 --> 05:13.138
I get that.

05:13.140 --> 05:15.207
But she's telling
a different story.

05:15.209 --> 05:17.742
One I can't just dismiss
out of hand.

05:17.744 --> 05:20.145
It's a Hail Mary.

05:20.147 --> 05:21.646
She's been
a highly effective officer

05:21.648 --> 05:23.481
for over 20 years, Carrie.

05:23.483 --> 05:26.051
Her intelligence product's been
nothing short of spectacular.

05:26.053 --> 05:27.586
Yeah, of course it has.

05:27.588 --> 05:29.421
Carefully curated
by Moscow Center

05:29.423 --> 05:31.556
to do minimum damage
to Russian interests

05:31.558 --> 05:34.526
and have maximum value
advancing her career.

05:34.528 --> 05:37.229
Look, you've made your point.

05:37.231 --> 05:40.332
But your part
in this play is over.

05:40.334 --> 05:42.567
You need to go.

05:42.569 --> 05:45.070
Saul?

05:45.072 --> 05:47.205
I'll call you.

05:47.207 --> 05:49.074
You're excused.

05:58.952 --> 06:01.953
Why so quiet?
What are you thinking?

06:01.955 --> 06:04.189
I'm thinking
she owned us, Dar.

06:04.191 --> 06:06.258
Allison did.

06:08.795 --> 06:11.363
Maybe so.

06:11.365 --> 06:13.598
But you should know something.

06:13.600 --> 06:15.133
Ivan Krupin's
just confirmed

06:15.135 --> 06:16.701
what you've been
saying all along.

06:16.703 --> 06:18.637
That it <i> was</i> the SVR

06:18.639 --> 06:21.439
who brought down
General Youssef's plane.

06:21.441 --> 06:24.276
It looks like you and Etai
are off the hook.

06:24.278 --> 06:27.245
Fuck me.

06:27.247 --> 06:29.781
A win is a win, Saul.

06:29.783 --> 06:33.151
Maybe you should
just accept it.

06:33.153 --> 06:36.721
There's a political
consideration as well.

06:36.723 --> 06:40.292
A Russian penetration
at this level

06:40.294 --> 06:42.661
would be a scandal
from which the Agency

06:42.663 --> 06:44.896
might never recover.

06:44.898 --> 06:47.065
I'm aware.

06:47.067 --> 06:48.900
It's not like she gets
to keep her station here.

06:48.902 --> 06:51.136
No, we send her back to Langley.

06:51.138 --> 06:53.638
Turn the investigation over
to counterintelligence.

06:57.077 --> 06:59.611
I want one more shot
at her first.

06:59.613 --> 07:01.279
The damage is
done, Saul.

07:01.281 --> 07:03.615
We can't change
what's happened,

07:03.617 --> 07:05.950
but we can contain it.

07:05.952 --> 07:07.652
I mean it, Dar.

07:07.654 --> 07:09.954
She took me around the block.

07:09.956 --> 07:12.290
If I can get
her to confess,

07:12.292 --> 07:14.759
maybe we can run her back
against the Russians.

07:16.029 --> 07:18.863
I don't have
a problem with that.

07:18.865 --> 07:20.432
You don't buy
her story, do you?

07:20.434 --> 07:22.467
Not for one second.

07:22.469 --> 07:25.103
Someone was thinking fast
on her feet.

07:25.105 --> 07:27.505
Is she gonna get
away with it?

07:27.507 --> 07:29.874
It's out of my hands.

07:29.876 --> 07:31.710
If she weren't so bloodless,
you'd really have to

07:31.712 --> 07:33.044
take your hat off to her.

07:33.046 --> 07:35.380
Or your wig, as
the case may be.

07:35.382 --> 07:38.583
Yeah. At least I won't be
wearing that anymore.

07:41.154 --> 07:43.521
Now I have to figure out
what happened to Quinn.

07:43.523 --> 07:45.557
What do you mean?
I thought he was with you.

07:45.559 --> 07:46.558
He was.

07:46.560 --> 07:47.992
And then he wasn't.

07:47.994 --> 07:50.362
How seriously
was he hurt?

07:50.364 --> 07:52.063
Pretty seriously.

07:52.065 --> 07:54.032
And he refused to go
to a hospital.

07:54.034 --> 07:55.133
When was this?

07:55.135 --> 07:57.202
Uh, nine days ago.

07:57.204 --> 07:58.336
Nine days?

07:58.338 --> 07:59.471
There's no record of him

07:59.473 --> 08:00.672
at any emergency room
or morgue.

08:00.674 --> 08:03.975
He just disappeared.

08:03.977 --> 08:06.177
What was his last location?

08:06.179 --> 08:08.880
An old garage at the corner
of Ritterstrae and Forster,

08:08.882 --> 08:10.415
near Gorlitzer Park.

08:10.417 --> 08:14.152
I'll back-check security
cameras in the area.

08:14.154 --> 08:16.221

08:39.172 --> 08:42.308

08:42.873 --> 08:43.974
_

08:43.975 --> 08:46.690
_

09:10.410 --> 09:12.811
So?

09:12.813 --> 09:14.879
So.

09:16.983 --> 09:19.884
I have some questions.

09:21.888 --> 09:24.122
Fire away.

09:24.124 --> 09:25.490
Should we sit?

09:25.492 --> 09:27.258
I'd rather stand.

09:27.260 --> 09:29.594
You seem angry, Allison.

09:29.596 --> 09:31.463
Shouldn't I be the angry one?

09:31.465 --> 09:33.164
I'm the aggrieved party here.

09:33.166 --> 09:34.666
Then again,

09:34.668 --> 09:35.934
you're angry by nature.

09:35.936 --> 09:37.936
One of the angriest men
I've ever known, actually.

09:37.938 --> 09:40.405
Is that right?

09:40.407 --> 09:43.241
It's one of the things that
made me curious about you.

09:43.243 --> 09:46.678
All that rage.

09:55.989 --> 09:59.157
You told Dar Adal you recruited
Ivan Krupin in Iraq?

09:59.159 --> 10:00.258
I did.

10:00.260 --> 10:02.026
Care to explain
how a junior officer

10:02.028 --> 10:05.029
fails to report the recruitment
of a major asset up the chain?

10:05.031 --> 10:07.198
I did report it.
Of course I did.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.333
To?

10:08.335 --> 10:11.269
Deputy Director Estes,

10:11.271 --> 10:12.837
Baghdad Station's
immediate supervisor.

10:12.839 --> 10:14.172
David Estes?

10:14.174 --> 10:15.373
Yes, David Estes.

10:15.375 --> 10:18.142
Who happens to be dead.

10:18.144 --> 10:20.879
Conveniently killed
in the 12/12 bombing at Langley.

10:20.881 --> 10:23.448
"Conveniently"-- I doubt
he'd share that assessment.

10:23.450 --> 10:25.049
What'd he do
with the information?

10:25.051 --> 10:27.018
No idea.

10:27.020 --> 10:29.220
We did discuss the string
of operational losses

10:29.222 --> 10:31.122
the Agency had suffered
at that point,

10:31.124 --> 10:33.391
so we decided
to keep the circle small.

10:33.393 --> 10:35.960
Very small, apparently.
Just you and him?

10:35.962 --> 10:38.396
I wouldn't know. I assume so.

10:38.398 --> 10:40.865
Either way, it would've
been his call.

10:40.867 --> 10:44.068
After his death, uh,
you told no one else about it?

10:44.070 --> 10:45.570
Source protection.

10:45.572 --> 10:47.572
Ivan was
understandably paranoid.

10:47.574 --> 10:49.407
So I attributed his intel

10:49.409 --> 10:52.210
to my other assets
in Eastern Europe.

11:01.187 --> 11:03.354
That's it?

11:03.356 --> 11:04.989
That was easy.

11:04.991 --> 11:06.758
Oh, I'm not done.

11:06.760 --> 11:08.026
- No?
- No.

11:08.028 --> 11:09.694
And I guarantee you this.

11:09.696 --> 11:11.529
Not one thing about your life
from this moment forward

11:11.531 --> 11:13.097
will be easy.

11:13.099 --> 11:15.400
I will personally see to that.

11:17.370 --> 11:19.537
You tried to have Carrie killed.

11:19.539 --> 11:21.072
Nonsense.

11:21.074 --> 11:22.073
She was your friend, Allison.

11:22.075 --> 11:23.274
<i>You</i> were my friend.

11:23.276 --> 11:25.777
More than that.

11:25.779 --> 11:28.580
Those butchered agents
in Cairo...

11:28.582 --> 11:30.615
that was yours, too, wasn't it?

11:30.617 --> 11:32.584
What about Drew Sanders,

11:32.586 --> 11:35.687
your Kiev deputy?

11:35.689 --> 11:37.922
What'd he do to deserve
a bullet in the face

11:37.924 --> 11:39.490
at extremely close range?

11:41.361 --> 11:43.394
Tell me, goddamn it.

11:43.396 --> 11:44.629
- Or what, Saul?
- He had a wife

11:44.631 --> 11:46.431
and three kids,
for Christ's sake.

11:46.433 --> 11:47.932
Yeah, and guess what, I'm
still in touch with them.

11:47.934 --> 11:50.101
I'm godmother to their
youngest, Kylie...

11:50.103 --> 11:51.536
Stop! Bullshit! Bullshit!

11:51.538 --> 11:52.704
You betrayed them all!

11:52.706 --> 11:54.405
And then you found
others to betray!

11:54.407 --> 11:56.074
All those networks rolled up!

11:56.076 --> 11:57.308
All those good people blown!

11:57.310 --> 11:59.143
What do you think
happened to them?!

11:59.145 --> 12:00.478
What the fuck
you think happened?!

12:00.480 --> 12:03.915
You are a fucking sociopath!

12:07.621 --> 12:09.754
Jesus Christ, Saul!

12:09.756 --> 12:12.223
Put him in an office
and sit on him!

12:16.763 --> 12:19.163
You okay?

12:19.165 --> 12:20.965
I think so.

12:20.967 --> 12:22.967
Can we get a doctor
in here, please?!

12:26.399 --> 12:27.537

12:27.681 --> 12:29.318

12:29.437 --> 12:31.103

12:37.937 --> 12:39.733

12:43.123 --> 12:45.023
Jonas, he's here!

12:45.025 --> 12:46.791
Sorry, Otto,
I didn't know.

12:46.793 --> 12:47.992
That's okay.

12:47.994 --> 12:49.360
Who is here?

12:49.362 --> 12:51.095
Faisal Marwan.

12:51.097 --> 12:52.964
One of the prisoners
released from Plotzensee prison.

12:52.966 --> 12:54.666
We've been trying
to convince him

12:54.668 --> 12:56.534
to bring a civil suit
against the government.

12:56.536 --> 12:57.769
He owned an electronics store.

12:57.771 --> 12:59.270
Sold cell phones
to his neighbors,

12:59.272 --> 13:01.172
some of whom
made calls to Syria,

13:01.174 --> 13:03.374
some of which were
intercepted by the CIA.

13:03.376 --> 13:06.511
Next thing you know,
he's a terrorist mastermind

13:06.513 --> 13:09.614
supplying communications
equipment to a jihadi network.

13:09.616 --> 13:12.183
Let's take his deposition
in the large conference room.

13:12.185 --> 13:14.285
I got to warn you,
he's nervous as hell.

13:14.287 --> 13:15.953
Well, he lost three
years of his life.

13:15.955 --> 13:17.822
Plus his
business and his home.

13:17.824 --> 13:20.291
Injustice, misery.

13:20.293 --> 13:22.627
What journalist could resist?

13:22.629 --> 13:24.662
I promised him the Foundation
would cover his legal fees,

13:24.664 --> 13:27.532
help with living expenses,
medical bills.

13:27.534 --> 13:28.700
That okay?

13:28.702 --> 13:30.401
That's totally okay.

13:30.403 --> 13:32.370
Let me know how it goes.

13:37.977 --> 13:40.678
That's everything
that happened to me,

13:40.680 --> 13:42.513
until I heard on the news

13:42.515 --> 13:44.982
that it was the spies
who had broken the law,

13:44.984 --> 13:46.984
not me,

13:46.986 --> 13:49.220
and that I was free.

13:49.222 --> 13:52.657
Free, but with nothing.

13:52.659 --> 13:56.861
Everything I had made
in my life was gone.

13:56.863 --> 13:58.730
So now,

13:58.732 --> 14:01.065
after all you've told us,

14:01.067 --> 14:03.367
how do you feel about Germany?

14:03.369 --> 14:06.070
I was a good citizen.

14:06.072 --> 14:09.440
I paid my taxes
and obeyed the laws.

14:09.442 --> 14:12.376
I kept my side of the bargain.

14:12.378 --> 14:14.479
Germany didn't.

14:16.349 --> 14:18.182
Thank you.

14:19.352 --> 14:21.619
This is the deposition
of Faisal Marwan,

14:21.621 --> 14:23.387
given at
the During Foundation.

14:23.389 --> 14:25.556
- That was great, Faisal.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

14:25.558 --> 14:28.059
The first step in making sure
what happened to you

14:28.061 --> 14:30.695
never happens
to anyone else ever again.

14:30.697 --> 14:32.029
Give us a moment.

14:38.138 --> 14:40.705
Is it enough?

14:40.707 --> 14:41.939
Will we win?

14:41.941 --> 14:43.474
Absolutely.

14:43.476 --> 14:44.909
The evidence the authorities
used to arrest you

14:44.911 --> 14:46.310
was illegally obtained.

14:46.312 --> 14:47.879
That's why your conviction
was overturned.

14:47.881 --> 14:50.882
You have every right
to sue for damages now.

14:50.884 --> 14:52.950
We have what we need,
but obviously,

14:52.952 --> 14:55.386
the government's lawyers
will want a chance to respond.

14:55.388 --> 14:58.089
What do you mean?

14:58.091 --> 15:00.291
Well, they will want
to question you, too.

15:00.293 --> 15:02.260
And it could get hostile.

15:02.262 --> 15:04.962
For example, they could ask
if you are a radical.

15:04.964 --> 15:08.933
Or how many
radical Islamists you know.

15:08.935 --> 15:10.468
None.

15:11.671 --> 15:14.005
23 people
with jihadi connections

15:14.007 --> 15:17.074
bought phones or-or SIM cards
in your store.

15:17.076 --> 15:19.277
Some multiple times.

15:19.279 --> 15:22.680
This man, um...

15:22.682 --> 15:25.683
Hajik Zayd,

15:25.685 --> 15:28.352
bought phones from you
on five separate occasions.

15:28.354 --> 15:30.288
You're sure
you don't know him?

15:30.290 --> 15:33.491
I heard his name, that's all.

15:33.493 --> 15:35.426
And you were
in prison with him.

15:35.428 --> 15:37.128
So?

15:37.130 --> 15:39.163
I don't know him.
I don't talk to him.

15:39.165 --> 15:41.699
Knowing someone because
you're locked up with them

15:41.701 --> 15:44.202
isn't a crime,
but trying to hide it

15:44.204 --> 15:45.903
makes you look bad.

15:49.509 --> 15:50.942
Okay.

15:50.944 --> 15:54.445
I know Hajik.

15:54.447 --> 15:58.115
Did you hang out
with him in prison?

15:58.117 --> 16:00.718
There are cameras
all over Plotzensee, Faisal.

16:00.720 --> 16:03.688
The government
already knows the answer.

16:10.163 --> 16:13.030
Okay.

16:13.032 --> 16:15.867
Sometimes I was with him
and the other guys,

16:15.869 --> 16:18.035
but for protection only.

16:18.037 --> 16:19.837
And did you hear anyone
talk about jihad?

16:19.839 --> 16:22.506
About Syria?
About operations?

16:22.508 --> 16:25.076
People talk about
Syria all the time.

16:25.078 --> 16:28.179
They talk about the caliphate,
about Assad, about...

16:28.181 --> 16:30.181
I hear, but I
don't listen.

16:30.183 --> 16:31.782
Nothing else?

16:35.221 --> 16:37.555
Once, I overheard
about an attack in Berlin,

16:37.557 --> 16:40.124
but mostly it was Syria.

16:44.697 --> 16:46.764
What sort of attack?

16:48.768 --> 16:51.168
I don't know!

16:51.170 --> 16:55.506
No, this is
important, Faisal.

16:55.508 --> 16:57.508
When?

16:59.512 --> 17:02.546
A few months, maybe a year ago.

17:02.548 --> 17:05.516
No, when did they say
this-this attack would happen?

17:05.518 --> 17:07.184
I don't know!

17:07.185 --> 17:09.086
Maybe it wasn't Berlin.

17:09.088 --> 17:11.955
Maybe just big talk.

17:17.130 --> 17:18.996
Mm-hmm.

17:22.035 --> 17:24.535
Wh-what is it?

17:24.537 --> 17:26.137
Will this hurt my case?

17:26.138 --> 17:27.405
No.

17:27.406 --> 17:29.073
Because you told us about it.

17:29.075 --> 17:31.242
Say the truth, please.

17:31.244 --> 17:32.443
She's right.

17:32.445 --> 17:36.347
Now that we know,
we can deal with it.

17:38.318 --> 17:40.818
Your case is still strong.

17:45.758 --> 17:47.758
I want to go home.

17:47.760 --> 17:49.760
- Of course.
- Sure.

17:49.762 --> 17:51.796
Let me arrange a ride.

17:52.765 --> 17:54.765
Faisal.

17:54.767 --> 17:56.834
Thank you.

18:01.274 --> 18:03.074
Thank you.

18:09.782 --> 18:13.250
Gunther will drive you home.

18:13.252 --> 18:16.187
Please call me
if you need anything.

18:22.628 --> 18:24.862
We'll be in
touch very soon.

18:24.864 --> 18:26.697
I promise.

18:35.875 --> 18:38.609
Look, it was
jailhouse chatter.

18:38.611 --> 18:40.444
- Meaningless.
- An attack in Berlin?

18:40.446 --> 18:41.445
We can't just sit on that.

18:41.447 --> 18:42.947
What are you suggesting?

18:42.949 --> 18:44.882
We turn him back over
to the Federal Police?

18:44.884 --> 18:46.517
- What are you suggesting?
- I don't know.

18:46.519 --> 18:47.518
Well...

18:47.520 --> 18:49.387
Not that.

18:49.389 --> 18:51.655
Is Otto still here?

18:51.657 --> 18:54.025
He's on a plane to Munich.
Back in the morning.

18:54.027 --> 18:57.294
So we'll talk to him tomorrow.

19:00.033 --> 19:02.099
All right.

19:47.034 --> 19:49.393
_

19:54.787 --> 19:57.021
...were ravaged
by the Post-World War One

19:57.023 --> 20:00.024
architects of the Middle East,
who tore apart the Khilafah

20:00.026 --> 20:02.760
and made it into countries
ruled by man-made laws.

20:02.762 --> 20:04.528
Our demands are simple.

20:04.530 --> 20:06.097
Erase these borders
from the maps,

20:06.099 --> 20:07.965
remove them from our hearts,
so that Muslims can

20:07.967 --> 20:10.101
once again live freely
in their lands.

20:10.103 --> 20:11.702
So that by Allah's good grace,

20:11.704 --> 20:14.305
his word can
once again be highest.

20:14.307 --> 20:16.474
We give the UN
Security Council 24 hours

20:16.476 --> 20:19.443
to recognize the legitimacy
of our Islamic State.

20:19.445 --> 20:21.812
Otherwise, a terrible justice
will be unleashed

20:21.814 --> 20:23.547
on a European city.

20:23.549 --> 20:27.451
Many will die by an invisible
and merciless poison.

20:27.453 --> 20:29.453
See for yourselves.

21:07.160 --> 21:09.660
May we have
the room, please?

21:20.806 --> 21:23.674
You've seen the video?

21:26.646 --> 21:29.213
Unbelievable.

21:35.288 --> 21:38.789
Any downside in telling
the Germans it's Peter Quinn?

21:40.726 --> 21:43.160
None that I can see.

21:43.162 --> 21:45.196
They'll find out
soon enough.

21:49.068 --> 21:50.801
Come on, then.

21:55.808 --> 21:57.208
Catch us up.

21:57.210 --> 21:58.676
We're coordinating
with the Federal Police

21:58.678 --> 22:00.144
to secure likely targets--

22:00.146 --> 22:01.979
airports,
train and bus stations,

22:01.981 --> 22:03.414
major public buildings,
including synagogues

22:03.416 --> 22:05.316
and church community centers.

22:05.318 --> 22:06.850
What about watch lists?

22:06.852 --> 22:09.386
High priority individuals
are being rounded up.

22:09.388 --> 22:12.656
But with the timeframe,
we're not very optimistic.

22:12.658 --> 22:14.858
To my ears, the 24 hours
sounded like a soft deadline.

22:14.860 --> 22:17.828
We can hope, but we have
to prepare for the worst.

22:17.830 --> 22:20.564
Meanwhile, we're analyzing
the video for clues

22:20.566 --> 22:22.933
as to where and when
it was made.

22:22.935 --> 22:24.935
We might be able
to help with that.

22:24.937 --> 22:26.537
Please.

22:26.539 --> 22:27.905
The victim is one of ours.

22:27.907 --> 22:29.673
Last time I
heard from him,

22:29.675 --> 22:33.177
he'd penetrated a terrorist
cell here in Berlin.

22:33.179 --> 22:35.012
You might have said something.

22:35.014 --> 22:36.880
I'm saying it now.

22:36.882 --> 22:40.417
What he reported was a group of
jihadis on their way to Syria.

22:40.419 --> 22:42.253
The leader had an
uncle there, he said,

22:42.255 --> 22:44.688
high up in the
power structure--

22:44.690 --> 22:47.258
Abu Al-Qaduli.

22:47.260 --> 22:49.159
The deputy emir?

22:50.563 --> 22:54.565
Which means our masked man
might be his nephew.

22:54.567 --> 22:56.066
You get that?

22:56.068 --> 22:57.268
Got it.

22:57.270 --> 22:59.136
One more thing.

22:59.138 --> 23:02.940
Your Station Chief
is asking to see you.

23:02.942 --> 23:04.975
Stay here.

23:10.916 --> 23:13.250
You wanted to see me?

23:13.252 --> 23:14.985
The doctor told me
what's going on.

23:14.987 --> 23:17.821
The gas in the video--
was it sarin?

23:17.823 --> 23:20.791
It's not confirmed,
but one would assume so, yes.

23:20.793 --> 23:22.993
- Why?
- I had a thought.

23:22.995 --> 23:25.162
So far, they've killed
only one man with the gas.

23:25.164 --> 23:28.065
Who's to say they have enough
for a mass casualty attack?

23:28.067 --> 23:29.933
At the very least,

23:29.935 --> 23:32.536
it's a question
we should know the answer to.

23:38.177 --> 23:40.477
Allison says
you're knowledgeable

23:40.479 --> 23:42.279
about Syria's
chemical weapon stockpile.

23:42.281 --> 23:45.382
I, um...

23:46.986 --> 23:49.687
might know
something about it, yes.

23:49.689 --> 23:51.855
Ivan helped draft
the framework agreement between

23:51.857 --> 23:55.192
Russia and the United States
to eliminate those weapons.

23:55.194 --> 23:58.495
Everything Assad declared--

23:58.497 --> 24:01.865
over 1,300 tons
of lethal material--

24:01.867 --> 24:03.500
was removed and destroyed.

24:03.502 --> 24:05.202
However,

24:05.204 --> 24:08.172
Assad did manage to hold back
some of his stockpile

24:08.174 --> 24:11.141
in the declaration process,
did he not?

24:11.143 --> 24:13.043
Inevitably.

24:15.648 --> 24:17.448
Is there a scenario

24:17.450 --> 24:19.316
in which you could imagine
Islamic State fighters

24:19.318 --> 24:21.285
getting their hands
on any of it?

24:22.722 --> 24:24.054
The Islamic State
is threatening

24:24.056 --> 24:25.556
to hit a European city.

24:25.558 --> 24:28.525
We need to know if they can
deliver on that threat.

24:31.197 --> 24:34.998
Six months ago,
the garrison at Taqba Air Base

24:35.000 --> 24:37.534
in Northern Syria was overrun.

24:39.872 --> 24:42.039
Our intelligence
confirmed chemical agents

24:42.041 --> 24:44.208
were being stored there.

24:44.210 --> 24:46.410
What type of
chemical agents?

24:46.412 --> 24:50.314
Drums of
methyl difluorophosphite.

24:50.316 --> 24:53.684
The volatile component of sarin.

24:53.686 --> 24:56.353
How many drums?

24:56.355 --> 24:59.189
Half a dozen.

24:59.191 --> 25:01.091
At least.

25:01.093 --> 25:02.893
If they have even
one drum of the stuff,

25:02.895 --> 25:05.028
an attack here is gonna
make Tokyo look like

25:05.030 --> 25:07.664
a rehearsal
for the real thing.

25:07.666 --> 25:09.366
Am I under arrest?

25:09.368 --> 25:11.769
It's something of an open
question at the moment.

25:11.771 --> 25:13.504
Not according to Saul,
it isn't.

25:13.506 --> 25:15.205
I'm sure he regrets
what happened.

25:15.207 --> 25:17.441
Listen, Dar, I'm not
asking you to believe me,

25:17.443 --> 25:19.176
not yet anyway,
but you don't want me

25:19.178 --> 25:20.511
on the sidelines, not now.

25:20.513 --> 25:22.413
- Allison...
- I'm not what Saul says.

25:22.415 --> 25:26.250
But even if I were, nobody
wants to see another Paris.

25:26.252 --> 25:27.718
Give me a babysitter.

25:27.720 --> 25:29.086
Put a lojack on my ass.

25:29.088 --> 25:30.287
I don't care.

25:30.289 --> 25:32.256
This is my backyard, Dar.

25:32.258 --> 25:34.958
I can help stop this thing.

25:36.027 --> 25:39.638
_

25:43.309 --> 25:45.630
_

25:46.257 --> 25:50.610
_

25:51.270 --> 25:53.335
_

25:53.814 --> 25:56.299
_

25:56.787 --> 25:58.090
_

25:58.334 --> 25:59.888
_

26:00.416 --> 26:01.602
_

26:01.716 --> 26:02.570
_

26:03.985 --> 26:06.803
_

26:07.170 --> 26:11.040
_

26:13.704 --> 26:16.946
_

26:18.454 --> 26:20.783
_

26:29.081 --> 26:30.681
You seem anxious.

26:30.683 --> 26:31.915
Aren't you?

26:31.917 --> 26:35.018
You're talking as if
the attack is certain.

26:35.020 --> 26:36.753
These governments
might give in.

26:36.755 --> 26:38.522
But they won't.

26:38.524 --> 26:41.859
They can't. Not now.

26:41.861 --> 26:44.595
They'll posture and rant
about how evil we are

26:44.597 --> 26:46.263
and try to retaliate.

26:46.265 --> 26:48.031
Then wh-why bother
with all this?

26:48.033 --> 26:49.666
So that their people
can blame them

26:49.668 --> 26:51.201
for what's about to happen.

26:51.203 --> 26:53.604
They might not listen
to us this time,

26:53.606 --> 26:55.873
or the next,
but the time after that,

26:55.875 --> 26:57.975
sooner than they think,
they will realize

26:57.977 --> 27:00.177
that denying us
will cost them more

27:00.179 --> 27:01.678
than they're willing to pay.

27:02.887 --> 27:04.041
_

27:27.540 --> 27:28.972
<i>Danke.</i>

27:28.974 --> 27:30.574
<i>Danke.</i>

27:41.487 --> 27:42.719
Saul.

27:42.721 --> 27:44.922
What the hell?

27:44.924 --> 27:46.156
Quinn.

27:46.158 --> 27:49.059
I know. Awful.

27:49.061 --> 27:51.061
Who is this group?

27:51.063 --> 27:52.329
Do we know?

27:52.331 --> 27:54.498
A Berlin cell.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.900
Some released from
Plotzensee prison, apparently.

27:56.902 --> 27:58.201
Quinn fell in
with them.

27:58.203 --> 27:59.436
Fell in? How?

27:59.438 --> 28:00.938
No idea.

28:00.940 --> 28:02.439
It doesn't make any sense.

28:02.441 --> 28:04.908
He was in no shape
to go anywhere.

28:04.910 --> 28:07.411
Well, Dar's the one
who saw him last.

28:08.881 --> 28:11.214
And-and the video--
when was it made?

28:11.216 --> 28:13.684
It wasn't
a live broadcast, so...

28:13.686 --> 28:15.919
best guess, sometime
in the last few days.

28:15.921 --> 28:18.055
We're in the process
of analyzing it.

28:18.057 --> 28:19.389
I need to see it.

28:19.391 --> 28:20.757
And not just
the sanitized version

28:20.759 --> 28:22.025
they're showing on TV.

28:22.027 --> 28:23.260
- Carrie...
- From beginning to end.

28:23.262 --> 28:24.695
He could be signaling.

28:24.697 --> 28:26.763
I knew him. I might...

28:26.765 --> 28:28.632
I might notice something.

28:29.602 --> 28:31.668
Could use the help.

28:33.939 --> 28:36.139
I want these motherfuckers
stopped, same as you.

28:36.141 --> 28:38.308
All right.
We'll talk later.

28:38.310 --> 28:40.110
Where are you going?

28:40.112 --> 28:41.945
- All hands on deck.
- Does that include Allison?

28:41.947 --> 28:43.780
I just saw her leave
with Dar Adal.

28:43.782 --> 28:45.082
Afraid so.

28:45.084 --> 28:47.050
Jesus Christ, Saul!

28:47.052 --> 28:49.119
Tell me about it.

28:51.256 --> 28:53.490
Come on, let's go.

28:57.496 --> 28:59.129
You're ready?

29:02.801 --> 29:04.568
It's pretty rough.

30:48.907 --> 30:50.974
Wait, go back.

30:54.546 --> 30:56.747
There-there's, um...

30:56.749 --> 30:59.282
some kind of floor tiles.

30:59.284 --> 31:00.283
Yeah.

31:00.285 --> 31:02.319
We're on it already.

31:04.757 --> 31:06.456
Oh, God.

31:18.537 --> 31:20.804
Okay, again.

31:26.908 --> 31:29.192
_

31:29.982 --> 31:31.448
Saul, what's the best way

31:31.450 --> 31:33.316
to get a private message
to Al-Baghdadi?

31:33.318 --> 31:34.918
I'm not sure we have a way.

31:34.920 --> 31:37.420
And even if we did,
what would we say?

31:37.422 --> 31:38.822
Don't fuck with us.

31:38.824 --> 31:40.257
Or what?

31:40.259 --> 31:42.058
Our only leverage
is boots on the ground;

31:42.060 --> 31:43.927
there's no bigger proponent
of an American invasion

31:43.929 --> 31:45.929
than the Islamic State itself.

31:45.931 --> 31:48.431
It could be argued that
that's what they want here,

31:48.433 --> 31:51.234
to draw us into another
hot war in the Middle East.

31:51.236 --> 31:53.670
Listen, Joe, it's unrealistic

31:53.672 --> 31:55.772
to think we're going to have
actionable intelligence

31:55.774 --> 31:57.674
by the 5:00 deadline.

31:57.676 --> 31:59.576
Can the President
buy us some time

31:59.578 --> 32:00.811
with the
Security Council?

32:00.813 --> 32:02.345
It's doubtful.

32:02.347 --> 32:03.780
He's on the phone now
with the Chancellor

32:03.782 --> 32:05.015
and the British Prime Minister.

32:05.017 --> 32:07.184
They are not in
an appeasing mood.

32:07.186 --> 32:09.986
A joint statement is scheduled
for 9:00 AM your time.

32:09.988 --> 32:12.088
Are they planning
to identify

32:12.090 --> 32:13.924
Berlin as the likely target?

32:13.926 --> 32:15.492
No, they are not.

32:15.494 --> 32:18.161
Joe, we should be
warning people here.

32:18.163 --> 32:21.164
We haven't faced anything
on this scale since 9/11.

32:21.166 --> 32:24.100
The idea was raised
and rejected.

32:24.102 --> 32:25.035
Why?

32:25.037 --> 32:27.804
You know why.

32:27.806 --> 32:29.673
We can't give
these assholes license

32:29.675 --> 32:32.909
to send our cities into mass
panic anytime they feel like it.

32:35.214 --> 32:36.746
It's the new normal, gentlemen.

32:45.691 --> 32:48.959
The BND just
identified a nephew

32:48.961 --> 32:51.027
of Abu Al-Qaduli
living in Germany.

32:51.029 --> 32:52.195
His name's Bibi Hamed.

32:52.197 --> 32:54.731
32 years old.

32:54.733 --> 32:56.399
Born in Hamburg to
Syrian immigrants.

32:56.401 --> 32:58.034
- Where is he now?
- Unclear.

32:58.036 --> 33:00.570
Apparently, Deutsche Telecom
is reporting

33:00.572 --> 33:02.906
his cell service has been
discontinued for over a year.

33:02.908 --> 33:05.175
- Gone to ground?
- Looks that way.

33:05.177 --> 33:06.810
The Federal Police
are feeding his photo

33:06.812 --> 33:08.511
into their CCTV
facial recognition system.

33:08.513 --> 33:10.347
Yeah, fingers crossed.

33:10.349 --> 33:12.482
Yeah. Meanwhile, we're checking
to see if any of our people

33:12.484 --> 33:14.651
can confirm
his presence in Berlin.

33:14.653 --> 33:18.021
Combing undead files,
revisiting old cases.

33:18.023 --> 33:19.389
Thanks.

33:19.391 --> 33:21.057
Need anything else
before I get back to it?

33:21.059 --> 33:22.325
Uh-uh.

33:22.327 --> 33:23.660
Saul?

33:23.662 --> 33:25.795
Excuse me.

33:34.239 --> 33:36.273
I'm just saying,
let the police talk to Marwan.

33:36.275 --> 33:38.241
Let them decide
if his information is relevant.

33:38.243 --> 33:40.677
The same people who imprisoned
him in the first place?

33:40.679 --> 33:42.879
You want to traumatize
him all over again?

33:42.881 --> 33:44.547
He is a cooperating witness

33:44.549 --> 33:46.683
who may know something
about an attack.

33:46.685 --> 33:49.286
We got him to talk by
promising to protect him.

33:49.288 --> 33:50.887
We can't just sell him
down the river

33:50.889 --> 33:52.789
- at the first sign of trouble.
- If Berlin is hit

33:52.791 --> 33:54.424
and we did nothing,
we are culpable.

33:54.426 --> 33:55.859
We have a
responsibility.

33:55.861 --> 33:58.528
What about
our responsibility to Marwan?

33:58.530 --> 34:01.364
Your responsibility?
You're his lawyer.

34:01.366 --> 34:02.933
Aren't you supposed to
look out for his interests?

34:02.935 --> 34:04.868
This has gone beyond
lawyers and interests.

34:04.870 --> 34:06.536
You saw the man
in the video.

34:06.538 --> 34:08.638
You want thousands
to die like that, in agony?

34:08.639 --> 34:13.310
15 years ago,
my country was attacked.

34:13.312 --> 34:16.478
And thousands did die.

34:16.481 --> 34:19.149
Every bit as horrible
as that video.

34:19.150 --> 34:21.551
And we wanted to
get the bastards

34:21.553 --> 34:23.820
who hurt us, so we did.

34:23.822 --> 34:25.422
We started two wars.

34:25.424 --> 34:29.259
Tens of thousands of people
died on both sides.

34:29.261 --> 34:32.094
And for what?

34:32.097 --> 34:34.264
We're still killing them,
they're still coming after us,

34:34.266 --> 34:35.398
and on and on.

34:35.400 --> 34:36.766
Nice speech, Laura.

34:36.768 --> 34:38.101
However, it has nothing
to do with Marwan.

34:38.103 --> 34:39.168
Really?

34:40.505 --> 34:42.672
I was in Kreuzberg
early this morning.

34:42.674 --> 34:44.239
The police are already
rounding up

34:44.242 --> 34:46.009
Muslim men outside the mosques.

34:46.011 --> 34:48.078
Anyone with a skullcap.

34:49.481 --> 34:52.014
I got him out just in time.

34:52.016 --> 34:54.184
You did what?

34:58.357 --> 35:00.256
Where is he?

35:00.258 --> 35:02.359
Here.

35:02.361 --> 35:06.196
In what I presume
is a safe place.

35:14.206 --> 35:16.940
Give me a minute, please.

35:19.978 --> 35:21.911
Please.

35:37.529 --> 35:39.329
Berenson.

35:39.331 --> 35:41.297
Mr. Berenson,
this is Otto During speaking.

35:41.299 --> 35:43.533
Not a good time;
we have a situation.

35:43.535 --> 35:47.170
I'm calling
about that situation.

35:47.172 --> 35:48.671
What is it?

35:48.673 --> 35:51.241
You know my foundation
does outreach work

35:51.243 --> 35:53.209
with the Muslim communities
here in Berlin.

35:53.211 --> 35:54.477
Yes.

35:54.479 --> 35:56.413
In the course of this work,

35:56.415 --> 35:58.014
we have come across
an individual

35:58.016 --> 36:00.550
who may have information
about the attack.

36:00.552 --> 36:02.252
What individual?

36:02.254 --> 36:06.689
Will you give me your word
that he'll be treated fairly?

36:06.691 --> 36:09.159
He's already suffered
at the hands of the authorities.

36:09.161 --> 36:11.161
You mean he's been
arrested before?

36:11.163 --> 36:12.529
Yeah. Wrongly.

36:12.531 --> 36:14.230
What's the information?

36:14.232 --> 36:18.535
First, I need your promise
that he will not be arrested

36:18.537 --> 36:21.905
and that his lawyer can be
present during all questioning.

36:21.907 --> 36:23.606
I'm serious, Mr. Berenson.

36:23.608 --> 36:25.442
You owe me this.

36:25.444 --> 36:27.610
You have my word. Where is he?

36:28.880 --> 36:30.380
In my care.

36:30.382 --> 36:32.882
Bring him in right now. Please.

36:32.884 --> 36:34.884
Yeah.

36:34.886 --> 36:36.953
I will.

36:42.570 --> 36:45.042
_

36:45.149 --> 36:46.426
_

36:54.860 --> 36:57.182
_

36:57.284 --> 36:58.304
_

36:58.392 --> 36:59.793
_

37:00.919 --> 37:02.557
_

37:03.227 --> 37:04.146
_

37:06.903 --> 37:09.529
_

37:09.919 --> 37:12.700
_

37:13.853 --> 37:17.198
_

37:19.177 --> 37:21.796
_

37:22.209 --> 37:23.603
_

37:24.243 --> 37:26.813
_

37:26.926 --> 37:27.866
_

37:27.966 --> 37:28.785
_

37:28.879 --> 37:29.751
_

37:29.840 --> 37:31.008
_

37:31.749 --> 37:33.381
_

37:33.542 --> 37:36.181
_

37:36.889 --> 37:38.135
_

37:42.221 --> 37:43.274
_

37:43.371 --> 37:45.062
_

37:45.136 --> 37:46.354
_

37:47.256 --> 37:48.563
_

37:48.721 --> 37:50.084
_

37:50.165 --> 37:53.221
_

38:09.614 --> 38:13.116
Hey, don't be
so hard on yourself.

38:15.720 --> 38:18.021
It was worth a try.

38:24.963 --> 38:27.597
He just didn't have enough time
to send a signal.

38:30.468 --> 38:34.237
He told me to leave it alone.

38:34.239 --> 38:37.307
He wanted me
to get out of Berlin.

38:37.309 --> 38:38.708
If only I'd listened.

38:38.710 --> 38:40.043
Carrie...

38:40.045 --> 38:42.579
No, it's true.

38:42.581 --> 38:45.081
Quinn never did anything
he didn't want to.

38:45.083 --> 38:47.483
That's the truth.

38:47.485 --> 38:49.252
He was a complete

38:49.254 --> 38:50.753
pain in the ass that way.

38:53.992 --> 38:56.059
Stubborn as a mule.

38:58.530 --> 39:00.597
But beautiful, too.

39:03.501 --> 39:05.268
Something on
the floor tiles.

39:05.270 --> 39:07.904
They're distinctive

39:07.906 --> 39:09.872
and probably part
of a mosaic of some kind.

39:09.874 --> 39:11.241
Well, that's encouraging.

39:11.243 --> 39:12.709
We thought so, too.

39:12.711 --> 39:14.177
Unfortunately, the artisan

39:14.179 --> 39:15.878
who created the mosaics
was prolific.

39:15.880 --> 39:17.380
More than
1,500 buildings

39:17.382 --> 39:19.349
in Berlin feature his work.

39:19.351 --> 39:21.451
- 1,500?
- I'm afraid so.

39:21.453 --> 39:25.088
We've got less than
12 hours. Shit.

39:25.090 --> 39:27.023
Can you post the addresses

39:27.025 --> 39:29.025
of these buildings
on a map of the city?

39:29.027 --> 39:30.627
Of course. Why?

39:30.629 --> 39:31.894
There's an algorithm

39:31.896 --> 39:34.430
JSOC used in Baghdad
to track down insurgents.

39:34.432 --> 39:36.933
Any hits yet on the FRS
search for Bibi Hamed?

39:36.935 --> 39:38.468
As a matter
of fact, yes.

39:38.470 --> 39:40.470
And not only
facial recognition.

39:40.472 --> 39:42.538
We've got locations
where he's used his credit card

39:42.540 --> 39:44.107
and made ATM withdrawals.

39:44.109 --> 39:45.074
Recently?

39:45.076 --> 39:46.776
Three months back.

39:46.778 --> 39:49.646
Then no activity at all.

39:53.084 --> 39:55.985
These are the confirmed
sightings in the last 120 days.

39:55.987 --> 39:57.887
Now show me
the last 60 days.

39:59.557 --> 40:01.157
Okay, now what?

40:01.159 --> 40:03.159
Overlay the location
of all those buildings.

40:03.161 --> 40:05.428
- See if we can narrow the search grid.
- Right.

40:16.675 --> 40:19.342
If Bibi's who we think he is,
probability is high

40:19.344 --> 40:20.843
that our building's somewhere

40:20.845 --> 40:22.812
within these
seven square kilometers.

40:22.814 --> 40:24.614
That's only 39 addresses.

40:24.616 --> 40:26.449
Let's take
this to Adler,

40:26.451 --> 40:28.518
get him to authorize
search teams.

40:38.769 --> 40:40.078

40:41.640 --> 40:44.800

40:46.344 --> 40:47.136

40:47.961 --> 40:49.229
_

41:04.643 --> 41:05.989
_

41:06.717 --> 41:08.460
_

41:10.048 --> 41:12.667
_

41:15.035 --> 41:16.504
_

41:17.356 --> 41:19.576

41:21.106 --> 41:22.836
_

41:22.988 --> 41:24.879

42:13.044 --> 42:14.602
_

42:14.741 --> 42:15.606

42:15.697 --> 42:16.589

42:16.889 --> 42:18.102

42:18.249 --> 42:19.412
_

42:19.585 --> 42:21.053
_

42:21.491 --> 42:22.242
_

42:22.357 --> 42:23.427
_

42:23.528 --> 42:24.692
_

42:24.873 --> 42:26.051
_

42:26.139 --> 42:27.553
_

42:27.814 --> 42:31.583
_

42:31.704 --> 42:33.378
_

42:33.878 --> 42:35.079
_

42:35.180 --> 42:36.508
_

42:36.598 --> 42:39.608
_

42:39.731 --> 42:41.100
_

42:41.419 --> 42:43.186
Bibi!

42:43.187 --> 42:45.714
_

42:45.749 --> 42:47.523
<i>La...</i>

42:48.827 --> 42:51.627
<i>La ilaha illa-llah...</i>

42:56.734 --> 42:58.468
Bibi...

43:09.907 --> 43:12.159
_

43:15.787 --> 43:16.986
Okay, no worries.

43:16.988 --> 43:18.988
Just remember everything
we talked about, and...

43:18.990 --> 43:20.423
I think you're gonna
be fine. They're...

43:20.425 --> 43:22.358
You're really doing this.

43:22.360 --> 43:23.593
I received guarantees.

43:23.595 --> 43:25.194
Think they're
worth anything?

43:25.196 --> 43:26.863
I trust the man
who made them.

43:26.865 --> 43:29.131
Jonas will be with Marwan
through the whole process.

43:33.705 --> 43:34.770
Fuck me.

43:36.341 --> 43:38.808
No! No! No!

43:40.345 --> 43:41.944
What's happening?!

43:41.946 --> 43:44.447
You said I wouldn't
be arrested!

43:48.219 --> 43:50.219
...CIA, Saul Berenson...

44:03.234 --> 44:05.801
Guarantees.

44:19.083 --> 44:21.884
Actually,
it's kind of comforting.

44:21.886 --> 44:23.419
What?

44:23.421 --> 44:25.421
This. You.

44:25.423 --> 44:27.490
Following me around.

44:30.395 --> 44:32.895
I want you to know

44:32.897 --> 44:35.331
I don't believe what
they're saying about you.

44:35.333 --> 44:36.899
None of us do.

44:36.901 --> 44:38.834
Thanks, Con.

44:38.836 --> 44:40.336
That means a lot.

45:05.875 --> 45:08.555
_

45:08.633 --> 45:10.700
Good.

45:10.701 --> 45:13.928
_

45:13.929 --> 45:15.588
_

45:15.623 --> 45:18.541
Over half the locations cleared.
Nothing yet.

45:20.478 --> 45:23.012
Shall we?

46:35.520 --> 46:37.386
Carrie. Over here.

47:14.592 --> 47:16.392
Carrie, what are you doing?

47:16.394 --> 47:18.227
If that's Peter, his body
is contaminated with sarin.

47:18.229 --> 47:20.296
It's not him.

48:14.652 --> 48:16.719
Quinn?

48:45.416 --> 48:47.516
Astrid, he just moved.

48:47.518 --> 48:49.618
- That's impossible, Carrie.
- He did.

48:49.620 --> 48:51.587
I saw it!

48:54.125 --> 48:55.925
He's alive.

49:39.637 --> 49:42.238
You got something
to tell me, Qasim?

49:45.009 --> 49:48.244
You were always so
studious, so pious.

49:48.246 --> 49:52.982
I thought your faith
would give you strength,

49:52.984 --> 49:55.517
but I was wrong.

49:55.519 --> 49:58.420
And Zaheer had to
pay for my mistake.

50:02.493 --> 50:05.094
You switched my kit?

50:05.096 --> 50:08.264
Because you are blood
and Zaheer is not.

50:08.266 --> 50:09.999
Bibi, I...

50:10.001 --> 50:11.734
Shut up.

50:11.736 --> 50:14.870
From now on, you don't talk,
you don't think.

50:14.872 --> 50:17.006
You just listen.

50:17.008 --> 50:19.575
Because the next time you do
something without my consent

50:19.577 --> 50:21.644
will be your last.
