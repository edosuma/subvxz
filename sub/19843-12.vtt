00:26.310 --> 00:30.064
Hey. Hello there.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.196
A little help here?

00:38.450 --> 00:40.281
No. No.

00:43.410 --> 00:45.958
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:46.130 --> 00:47.165
No.

00:47.380 --> 00:50.201
- I'm so hungry.
- No, no, no.

00:50.960 --> 00:54.839
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:55.220 --> 00:56.630
No, no.

01:12.490 --> 01:17.610
- First you, then Joy.
- No, not Joy! Not Joy!

01:19.700 --> 01:21.782
- Everything all right?
- Huh?

01:22.160 --> 01:23.536
Huh? Huh? Huh?

01:23.750 --> 01:24.819
Your heart rate's high.

01:29.500 --> 01:33.084
I... I don't like being strapped down.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.796
What's your name?

01:35.130 --> 01:36.176
Nurse Hill.

01:36.510 --> 01:37.795
What's your first name?

01:38.430 --> 01:39.419
Stacy.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.591
Stacy. That's a nice name.

01:44.520 --> 01:47.978
You... You know who I am,
how much I'm worth, right?

01:48.440 --> 01:49.646
Of course, Mr Meachum.

01:49.900 --> 01:52.471
Call me Ward.

01:53.360 --> 01:57.103
I will pay you whatever you earn
in a year,

01:57.450 --> 02:00.829
if you unstrap me and get me out of here.
Tonight.

02:01.030 --> 02:02.611
What kind of nurse would I be?

02:02.910 --> 02:05.868
I have to
get out of here, so that I can...

02:06.080 --> 02:08.662
- Get more drugs?
- No. No.

02:09.290 --> 02:12.248
I have to get my sister away from my...

02:12.460 --> 02:14.087
My...

02:14.380 --> 02:16.336
I know this withdrawal feels severe.

02:16.840 --> 02:19.172
Frankly, it's the worst
I've seen in a long time.

02:19.590 --> 02:20.921
But as the Bible says...

02:22.050 --> 02:23.176
"This too shall pass."

02:23.390 --> 02:24.379
Please.

02:25.020 --> 02:29.969
Stacy, get me outta here.
I will pay you whatever you want.

02:30.230 --> 02:31.390
Whatever you want.

02:31.560 --> 02:33.357
Get me out!

02:34.570 --> 02:35.980
Get me out!

03:05.470 --> 03:06.676
Hello, Ward.

03:06.930 --> 03:08.090
What are you doing?

03:09.640 --> 03:10.800
Oh, relax.

03:11.440 --> 03:12.759
I'm here to help.

03:17.190 --> 03:18.316
There you go.

03:18.530 --> 03:21.943
You've been poisoned
by Madame Gao's synthetic heroin.

03:22.700 --> 03:27.034
- You know her? Who are you?
- My name is Bakuto.

03:29.210 --> 03:32.623
Think of this drug as a shortcut
past your withdrawal symptoms.

03:33.290 --> 03:34.530
Are you with the hospital?

03:35.460 --> 03:38.042
No, no... I'm with the Hand.

03:38.300 --> 03:39.915
Oh, shit.

03:40.170 --> 03:41.546
Though, I'm no friend of Gao's.

03:41.720 --> 03:42.835
What do you want?

03:44.140 --> 03:45.539
I want to be your friend.

03:47.010 --> 03:48.887
I can get help you get out of here.
And most importantly,

03:48.970 --> 03:50.676
I can free you from your father.

03:50.980 --> 03:53.972
And how can you do that?

03:54.440 --> 03:56.146
I can make sure he never comes back.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.469
From the dead, I mean.

03:59.070 --> 04:01.561
It's a gift that we've given to a very
chosen few.

04:02.320 --> 04:04.777
We can_see_ that we made a mistake
In gIVIng It to Harold.

04:05.490 --> 04:06.570
You know this, too.

04:07.490 --> 04:09.492
This has a cost, right?

04:10.790 --> 04:13.418
We are living in a new age
where governments

04:13.830 --> 04:16.879
aren't the true controllers
of man's destinies.

04:18.380 --> 04:21.668
It's corporations like Rand Enterprises
that govern the world.

04:22.590 --> 04:24.797
So, you wanna run Rand like Gao.

04:25.050 --> 04:26.790
No. No, not like Gao.

04:28.100 --> 04:29.761
She's all stick and no carrot.

04:31.350 --> 04:34.092
I want you in charge,
because Harold has become...

04:34.350 --> 04:37.353
- Goddamn dangerous.
- He can't be trusted.

04:38.270 --> 04:41.353
Our relationship would be
more quid pro quo.

04:42.280 --> 04:44.908
Take this drug I'm giving you now,
for instance.

04:45.360 --> 04:48.579
There are countless poor souls
that are addicted to Gao's drugs,

04:48.780 --> 04:50.862
going through your same withdrawal.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.959
And you're saying
you would share this with Rand?

04:56.420 --> 04:59.662
All of this and freedom
from your father forever.

04:59.840 --> 05:02.047
It... sounds good, no?

05:02.670 --> 05:04.672
Yeah.

05:04.970 --> 05:07.791
Good. I do have an immediate favour
to ask of you.

05:08.890 --> 05:09.959
And that is?

05:10.680 --> 05:12.807
Help me capture the Iron Fist,

05:13.480 --> 05:16.517
and you and your sister will be safe.

06:39.940 --> 06:41.055
Bakuto...

06:44.070 --> 06:45.856
My sensei wanted to kill me.

06:48.650 --> 06:52.108
Don't believe anything she says, Danny.
She's Hand.

06:52.620 --> 06:55.692
I... I was. I'm not anymore.

06:56.160 --> 06:58.071
What sort of a relationship
do you have with her?

06:58.500 --> 07:01.242
Davos, relax. This is Colleen Wing.

07:02.210 --> 07:04.792
You're Davos? From K'un-Lun?

07:05.460 --> 07:07.087
You told a member of the Hand about me?

07:08.720 --> 07:10.756
He didn't know I was with them.

07:11.510 --> 07:16.459
So, you lied to him. To what?
Seduce the Iron Fist to your side?

07:17.270 --> 07:18.726
- Or was it to kill him?
- Hey.

07:19.350 --> 07:21.147
I would never hurt Danny.

07:21.310 --> 07:24.564
She helped us escape the compound.
She paid a steep price for it.

07:24.770 --> 07:27.273
Or they faked her defection
to get her on the inside with us.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.448
- It's what they do.
- That's not why she's here.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.065
She's running from them.

07:31.780 --> 07:33.111
She's on our side.

07:33.490 --> 07:34.479
Fine.

07:36.330 --> 07:37.866
Then she can help us blow up
the whole compound

07:38.040 --> 07:39.746
with Bakuto and his minions inside.

07:41.120 --> 07:42.200
You can't do that.

07:44.790 --> 07:46.872
Hey, students from my dojo are in there.

07:47.800 --> 07:51.793
They're not bad. They just...
They don't know what's really going on.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.711
So those were your students
I broke to pieces,

07:55.890 --> 07:57.209
who tried to stop us from escaping?

07:57.640 --> 07:59.517
Hey, stop! Stop! Stop!

07:59.730 --> 08:02.631
You see? She's still with them!

08:02.810 --> 08:04.346
This asshole was your best friend?

08:04.520 --> 08:05.930
Look, just calm down! The both of you!

08:06.520 --> 08:09.182
- You're behaving like animals.
- I'm the only rational one here.

08:09.650 --> 08:12.528
The Iron Fist destroys
the Hand no matter what.

08:13.570 --> 08:16.027
If you can't do it, I will. I will!

08:16.240 --> 08:17.696
Hey! Hey! Hey!

08:19.240 --> 08:22.573
- Let her go!
- He's ignorant. Don't let him bait you.

08:23.500 --> 08:26.207
It's all he knows.
All he's ever been taught.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.246
When did you become such a milkmaid,
Danny?

08:28.800 --> 08:31.712
We're gonna take care of Bakuto,
and we're doing it with Colleen.

08:32.670 --> 08:35.218
You know, this place has confused you.

08:36.510 --> 08:38.922
It's no wonder you can't summon
the Iron Fist.

08:43.270 --> 08:44.259
Hey.

08:55.910 --> 08:56.945
You know, last week,

08:57.120 --> 08:59.156
if you would have told me
that I'd be here,

08:59.450 --> 09:01.441
working with my daughter,
I wouldn't have believed it.

09:03.290 --> 09:06.782
_Reunion would be a hell of a lot better
If we weren't taking down drug dealers.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.628
Oh, well, we take our blessings
where we can find 'em.

09:12.380 --> 09:14.336
You used to say that to me
when I'd sit with you

09:14.510 --> 09:15.829
during your chemo treatments.

09:22.060 --> 09:23.266
Yeah, I remember.

09:29.190 --> 09:33.308
Yeah, you'd sit and talk to me
about school, and...

09:34.240 --> 09:36.526
your latest drama with your friends,
and...

09:36.910 --> 09:39.617
Oh, you sang that one song over and over.

09:39.950 --> 09:42.236
- "Crazy in Love"?
- Yeah.

09:43.700 --> 09:44.997
Hey...

09:47.120 --> 09:51.454
I know it wasn't easy being there
by my side during those treatments.

09:54.590 --> 09:58.583
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
I mean, those moments...

10:00.180 --> 10:02.057
I felt like I had you all to myself.

10:02.890 --> 10:04.266
Well, it meant a lot.

10:06.100 --> 10:07.977
Well, here we are with a second chance.

10:11.690 --> 10:14.932
Promise me when this is all over,
we can make up for lost time.

10:15.110 --> 10:19.524
- Mm-hm.
- You, me, Danny, Ward.

10:21.030 --> 10:22.019
Like a...

10:22.910 --> 10:24.480
- Like a family vacation.
- Yeah.

10:25.830 --> 10:28.492
Hey, I've always wanted
to go to Australia.

10:29.540 --> 10:30.529
Deal.

10:30.710 --> 10:31.870
You've got a visitor.

10:32.040 --> 10:34.497
Told you no one but Danny
was allowed up here.

10:40.800 --> 10:41.880
Ward.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.925
Hey!

10:46.350 --> 10:48.090
Oh.

10:51.310 --> 10:53.312
Ward. What are you doing here?

10:53.820 --> 10:55.435
I came to have a word with Joy.

10:55.610 --> 10:58.067
Where have you been?
I mean, Dad said you were getting help.

10:58.240 --> 11:02.233
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.
- Um...

11:04.370 --> 11:06.656
I need to talk with Joy alone.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.993
Well, anything you have to say to Joy,
you can say to me.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.410
Hey, it's okay. Just give us a sec.

11:19.590 --> 11:20.830
So how are you?

11:21.050 --> 11:23.291
Give the hospital a call.
Find out how he's been released.

11:23.470 --> 11:24.846
Yeah, much better.

11:25.140 --> 11:27.267
I was hoping we could head out
for a little bit and catch up.

11:27.560 --> 11:29.130
Uh... Yeah, definitely. But...

11:29.640 --> 11:31.642
right now,
we're in middle of something big.

11:32.810 --> 11:34.607
- What?
- Well, I'm...

11:34.940 --> 11:37.602
I'm helping Dad free us from the Hand.

11:38.570 --> 11:39.946
Oh, Jesus.

11:40.990 --> 11:43.231
- What?
- He's using you, Joy.

11:43.780 --> 11:47.113
He's not using me.
I came up with the plan.

11:47.290 --> 11:49.155
He needs me. Ward, he needs us.

11:49.330 --> 11:51.412
You need to get away from him right now.

11:51.960 --> 11:53.621
You've no idea
what you're up against here.

11:53.790 --> 11:55.371
No, I know exactly what I'm up against.

11:55.590 --> 11:57.080
I've laid out everything the Hand's doing.

11:57.250 --> 12:00.219
I'm not talking about them.
I'm talking about Dad.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.079
- He needs us.
- No.

12:04.590 --> 12:06.387
He's always been a bastard to me.

12:07.140 --> 12:10.849
Ever since he came back from the dead,
it's like a...

12:11.060 --> 12:15.303
It's like a piece of his soul
got left in the grave.

12:16.270 --> 12:18.352
He will use you, hurt you,

12:18.570 --> 12:20.777
and throw you aside
without a second thought.

12:22.320 --> 12:26.484
- You're not making any sense.
- I understand.

12:28.450 --> 12:30.406
Let's just go so we can talk, okay?

12:31.040 --> 12:32.860
- Where are we...
- What's the problem, Ward?

12:35.750 --> 12:36.876
No problem.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.950
I just wanna spend
some quality time with Joy.

12:41.130 --> 12:45.214
The hospital that you sent me to
recommended that I make amends to her.

12:46.260 --> 12:47.670
Part of the whole NA business.

12:47.970 --> 12:49.130
That's funny.

12:50.350 --> 12:53.558
Singleton called the hospital,
said no doctor signed off on your release.

12:56.690 --> 13:01.184
Trust me. I'm on the road to wellness.
Joy IS part of It.

13:05.570 --> 13:07.151
Joy, let's go.

13:09.660 --> 13:12.197
I haven't had a dad for 13 years, Ward,

13:13.250 --> 13:15.992
and by some miracle, he's... he's here.

13:17.210 --> 13:19.371
I want us to stay here with him, okay?

13:19.750 --> 13:21.456
- Do you understand?
- God damn it!

13:21.630 --> 13:24.007
- You need to get away from Harold.
- Hey, now, son...

13:24.170 --> 13:25.876
Don't "now, son" me.

13:26.970 --> 13:29.461
- You see how off he is, right?
- You're the one that seems off.

13:29.640 --> 13:31.460
That's because whoever this is, isn't...

13:32.390 --> 13:35.848
He isn't our dad, okay?

13:36.060 --> 13:38.642
This... This thing crawling around
in our dad's skin,

13:38.810 --> 13:43.270
he is violent, dangerous...
He's killed two men that I know of.

13:43.530 --> 13:45.816
I have no doubt that he killed Wilkins.

13:46.400 --> 13:47.810
Have you seen Kyle around lately?

13:48.370 --> 13:49.359
Who's Kyle?

13:49.530 --> 13:51.828
It pains me to say this, Joy.
It's clear that Ward still needs help.

13:51.990 --> 13:53.196
It doesn't matter. Let's just go.

13:53.370 --> 13:54.746
- Let's just go now.
- Kevin.

13:59.670 --> 14:00.876
Dad, stop this!

14:02.920 --> 14:06.333
Get back! Get back!

14:07.590 --> 14:08.636
Do it!

14:10.800 --> 14:11.801
Ward.

14:12.180 --> 14:13.556
Why couldn't you have just come with me?

14:13.720 --> 14:17.759
- Why does everything have to be so...
- Goddamn hard?

14:18.520 --> 14:20.351
- Let her go.
- Oh, you've lost it, son.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.317
I don't care what you think.
Joy's coming with me.

14:23.940 --> 14:27.273
Okay. Yeah. I'll come with you.

14:28.360 --> 14:29.440
I'll come with you.

14:29.950 --> 14:31.986
- Just put the gun away.
- I will put the gun away

14:32.160 --> 14:35.402
when we are on the elevator
and away from here. Deal?

14:35.790 --> 14:38.862
Deal. It's fine. Don't worry about it.
It's fine.

14:39.460 --> 14:40.529
I can stop this.

14:42.040 --> 14:45.749
- No, don't.
- Shut up, both of you!

14:46.050 --> 14:47.335
Push the button.

15:04.150 --> 15:05.390
No, no, no, no, no.

15:05.570 --> 15:07.276
I told you,
not until I got Joy out of here.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.567
What the hell's going on?
Who are these guys?

15:09.820 --> 15:12.232
Looks like I interrupted
a lovely family moment.

15:12.490 --> 15:14.731
Your backstabbing brother
has turned us over to the Hand.

15:14.990 --> 15:18.073
I promise you this is for the best.
Harold is a monster.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.569
No, you're the monster.

15:20.830 --> 15:22.570
Enough. All of you.

15:24.380 --> 15:27.588
You goddamn idiot.
You're screwing everything up.

15:31.130 --> 15:33.678
You need to take control of your passions,
Ward.

15:34.140 --> 15:36.461
You'll never be a great leader
until you do.

15:46.150 --> 15:50.234
I'm sorry about that,
but no one pulls weapons on me.

15:50.990 --> 15:53.902
All of you, please, to the couch.

15:54.490 --> 15:56.026
Take a seat and calm down.

16:05.630 --> 16:10.215
Ward... Would you please
stop the transfer of my money?

16:11.550 --> 16:14.178
Let Joy and I leave, please.

16:14.720 --> 16:16.347
None of this was part of the deal.

16:17.390 --> 16:18.379
Do it.

16:27.690 --> 16:30.272
Did you really think taking my money
would work?

16:30.610 --> 16:33.101
Oh, what's this deal?

16:33.700 --> 16:37.943
Hmm. You must really
be quite the bitter pill, Harold,

16:38.450 --> 16:40.862
because your son is giving me
access to Rand

16:41.040 --> 16:42.701
in exchange for killing you.

16:43.250 --> 16:46.322
That, and helping me capture Danny Rand.

16:47.590 --> 16:48.705
Done.

16:51.460 --> 16:52.757
Can Joy and I leave now?

16:53.090 --> 16:54.125
No.

16:54.930 --> 16:56.716
Come, sit over here.

17:04.100 --> 17:06.091
You weren't really
gonna have Dad killed, right?

17:09.520 --> 17:11.647
You poor people are such a mess.

17:12.150 --> 17:14.527
I know a good family therapist
that could help,

17:14.700 --> 17:16.941
should any of you survive the night.

17:17.950 --> 17:19.076
Wait, what?

17:25.330 --> 17:27.707
Hey! Hey! Hey!

17:29.130 --> 17:32.202
I'm gonna come back for you, Bakuto.

17:32.460 --> 17:34.416
And I'm gonna show you no mercy.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.290
You're not coming back.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.461
Once we remove your head from your body,

17:38.640 --> 17:40.801
- there will be no returning...
- You're not killing my father!

17:40.970 --> 17:43.268
- Hey, hey!
- Hey! Hey.

17:45.100 --> 17:48.092
You're testing the limits of my patience.

17:48.270 --> 17:51.603
Stay still, Joy. Don't move.
Everything'll be okay.

17:54.280 --> 17:55.770
Don't do this in front of Joy.

17:56.150 --> 17:59.529
I will get you anything you want. Name it.

18:00.830 --> 18:01.945
Your phone.

18:02.490 --> 18:03.491
What?

18:04.330 --> 18:06.366
Your phone.

18:08.540 --> 18:09.529
Why?

18:09.750 --> 18:12.742
Well, obviously, I'd like to make a call.

18:13.960 --> 18:14.949
Hmm.

18:15.760 --> 18:18.217
Hmm.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.016
You were very brave out there.

18:29.850 --> 18:31.647
I was very stupid out there.

18:33.860 --> 18:36.021
Everything Bakuto said to me was a lie.

18:38.110 --> 18:39.350
And I believed him.

18:40.990 --> 18:41.979
Hey.

18:43.030 --> 18:45.032
That's because he is a piece of garbage,

18:46.790 --> 18:47.905
and you're human.

18:50.460 --> 18:53.588
The longer I spend in New York,

18:54.630 --> 18:57.212
the more I realise the duality in life.

19:01.430 --> 19:05.173
My grandmother always said
that that was the truest sign of wisdom.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.436
I didn't get it then, but now...

19:13.230 --> 19:16.688
I'm gonna put you in a hotel.

19:18.150 --> 19:19.310
You're not safe here.

19:20.570 --> 19:21.946
You've been through enough as it is.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.441
No, I'm not hiding.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.781
I want Bakuto dead, too.

19:29.250 --> 19:30.535
We're losing focus.

19:41.930 --> 19:43.136
Hello, Danny.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.385
Bakuto?

19:50.560 --> 19:53.518
I’m sorry it’s come to this,
but you ’ve left me with few opﬁons.

19:53.900 --> 19:55.015
Bakuto, you can't.

19:55.190 --> 19:58.899
You should take this as a compliment.
It shows how much you mean to me.

20:01.070 --> 20:02.651
No!

20:06.530 --> 20:08.612
You're gonna be okay.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.576
No. Joy.

20:10.790 --> 20:12.746
I need you to know
how serious I am.

20:13.330 --> 20:16.163
It's a clean in and out.
Get her to the hospital within...

20:16.750 --> 20:18.627
thirty minutes or so, and she ’l/ be okay.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.547
But if you ’re not here within
half an hour,

20:26.470 --> 20:28.347
you'll lose another family.

20:28.890 --> 20:31.097
Okay. I'm coming.

20:32.640 --> 20:34.301
- You're not going.
- Of course, I'm going.

20:34.480 --> 20:36.186
The Iron Fist does not surrender.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.816
Look, I'm not gonna let them die.

20:37.980 --> 20:39.720
Who cares about them?

20:39.940 --> 20:42.443
Wait for Bakuto to leave the building,
then we take him down.

20:42.610 --> 20:44.487
I'm not losing my family
to the Hand again.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.480
- Danny.
- I'm the Iron Fist.

20:47.990 --> 20:49.400
You don't tell me what to do.

21:00.090 --> 21:01.626
I'm gonna get you through this.

21:03.630 --> 21:06.087
Here. Compress these on both sides
of the wound.

21:08.300 --> 21:10.461
And this should help
with the pain.

21:10.640 --> 21:12.676
Let me get her to a hospital.

21:12.930 --> 21:14.807
Danny said he's coming. He will.

21:16.940 --> 21:19.181
I don't know. Two minutes to go.

21:19.440 --> 21:21.988
Maybe Danny's figured,
with all of you out of the way,

21:22.150 --> 21:23.390
he'll be in charge of Rand.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.565
That's not who he is.

21:26.740 --> 21:28.617
Shh! Relax.

21:29.330 --> 21:31.366
Danny always knew the right thing to do.

21:32.540 --> 21:33.825
Unlike you and me.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.827
All the questionable shit we've done
in the name of Rand...

21:38.000 --> 21:39.786
Hey, hey, hey. That's not true, Joy.

21:40.130 --> 21:44.294
This is all very touching, but time is up.

21:50.010 --> 21:54.879
This blade has cut down kings,
emperors, lords and tyrants.

21:56.140 --> 21:59.359
If you would have told me I might use it
on a businessman?

21:59.730 --> 22:02.608
Well, I wouldn't wanna desecrate
the integrity of your blade.

22:03.110 --> 22:04.145
Hmm.

22:10.200 --> 22:11.986
You're not gonna want to move, Harold.

22:13.240 --> 22:15.151
I don't wanna have to swing twice.

22:15.660 --> 22:17.116
Any last words?

22:20.840 --> 22:21.909
Yeah.

22:24.170 --> 22:25.159
Ward...

22:26.510 --> 22:30.594
I invested my life into you,
to raise you to be a great man.

22:32.100 --> 22:34.591
You've been the biggest disappointment
of my life.

22:35.220 --> 22:38.895
Joy, I apologise for choosing Ward
over you.

22:39.060 --> 22:42.939
It was a mistake. Never trust him again.

22:44.280 --> 22:47.693
Joy. I love you.

22:48.280 --> 22:49.690
Dad!

22:51.570 --> 22:53.231
I'm ready.

22:56.040 --> 22:58.110
Stop, please.

23:03.170 --> 23:04.626
Stop!

23:08.880 --> 23:10.882
Oh, cutting it close there.

23:12.760 --> 23:13.840
Cover him.

23:16.220 --> 23:17.471
Let him go.

23:21.270 --> 23:23.261
Oh, my little girl.

23:23.400 --> 23:25.641
Hey, it's okay, Joy.

23:30.660 --> 23:31.979
It's okay. It's okay.

23:33.280 --> 23:35.487
It's okay. Don't move.

23:36.330 --> 23:38.070
- Danny...
- Hey.

23:39.330 --> 23:40.911
You came for us.

23:41.250 --> 23:42.706
She needs a doctor.

23:43.920 --> 23:47.299
Once we leave,
then she'll get medical attention.

23:50.170 --> 23:51.330
Fine.

23:54.510 --> 23:56.171
Then let's go.

24:00.890 --> 24:03.051
I'm sorry, but we have to do this.

24:06.860 --> 24:10.648
You don't need those.
I've surrendered of my own free will.

24:10.860 --> 24:12.270
Oh, it's just a precaution.

24:12.700 --> 24:15.988
Even without the Iron Fist,
you are a formidable opponent.

24:21.500 --> 24:25.493
Unfortunately, Ward, I won't be able
to live up to my part of the deal.

24:27.380 --> 24:28.540
On the bright side,

24:29.170 --> 24:33.174
now you know how to get rid
of your father for good.

24:34.470 --> 24:35.630
You set this up?

24:36.800 --> 24:37.880
I'm sorry, Danny.

24:38.060 --> 24:39.049
Time to go.

24:41.640 --> 24:43.688
- Don't let them take him.
- Hey. Shh. Shh.

24:43.900 --> 24:45.470
- We can't let them take him.
- Shh, shh.

24:45.560 --> 24:47.767
Danny's making a noble sacrifice for us.

24:48.110 --> 24:50.431
- No. It's not okay.
- Shh. Shh.

24:50.650 --> 24:52.356
- Hey, hey.
- Danny!

24:52.530 --> 24:53.599
Shut up!

24:55.490 --> 24:57.902
Oh, I'm sorry for the outburst.
You carry on.

25:03.160 --> 25:05.367
Once they leave the building,
I'll get you to the hospital.

25:05.920 --> 25:06.955
Hey, it's okay.

25:07.170 --> 25:09.081
Hey, get your ass over here and help us.

25:12.090 --> 25:15.002
Those people upstairs
are a pit of vipers.

25:15.640 --> 25:17.961
You should thank me for getting you away
from them.

25:18.970 --> 25:21.347
What use do you have for the Iron Fist?

25:23.480 --> 25:26.222
You know, when I was a child,

25:26.690 --> 25:28.851
my mother told me
the story of the Sack Man,

25:29.520 --> 25:33.889
a sort of bogeyman who shows up
at disobedient children's homes

25:34.070 --> 25:36.402
and steals them away
in his sack to sell them.

25:37.200 --> 25:40.488
It's nonsense, really,
but it kept us in line.

25:42.200 --> 25:44.828
Nobody wanted to be captured by him.

25:45.920 --> 25:47.706
So what?

25:48.380 --> 25:50.371
You want your own personal Sack Man?

25:50.920 --> 25:53.502
Oh, notjust mine.

25:54.300 --> 25:56.621
There's someone in our organisation

25:57.220 --> 25:59.256
who's very anxious to work with you.

26:00.640 --> 26:02.380
We're going to change the world.

26:05.310 --> 26:07.847
Well, the promises I've made
you are still in place.

26:08.020 --> 26:12.104
I'll help you realign your chi
so you can access the Iron Fist again.

26:13.440 --> 26:16.443
I'll help you become
what you were meant to be.

26:19.070 --> 26:20.947
I don't even know what I'm meant to be.

26:22.370 --> 26:23.826
How are you gonna help?

28:08.020 --> 28:10.306
I kind of got this feeling
you're not allowed to kill me.

28:10.850 --> 28:13.728
That doesn't mean I won't do
what it takes to subdue you.

28:17.940 --> 28:20.397
We have some of the best doctors
in the world.

28:20.780 --> 28:23.237
You'd be amazed
at what they can stitch back together.

30:29.820 --> 30:32.823
Colleen, do you really think
you're worthy to challenge me?

30:33.990 --> 30:35.821
These two are warriors.

30:37.080 --> 30:41.449
You are nothing but a betrayer.
You have no honour.

30:42.420 --> 30:45.583
I should have recognised
you were too weak to be Hand.

30:46.550 --> 30:47.869
Deep in your soul,

30:48.340 --> 30:51.252
you know that you are nothing more
than a teacher of children...

30:51.930 --> 30:54.421
at a dojo that I gave you.

30:58.850 --> 31:00.181
He's trying to draw you out.

31:01.190 --> 31:03.852
I know. But he's mine.

31:46.110 --> 31:47.475
VVhoa!

32:07.210 --> 32:08.336
You've learned well.

32:09.380 --> 32:11.621
But you're only as strong as your weapon.

32:21.600 --> 32:24.012
What matters is how you use your weapon.

32:32.400 --> 32:34.732
He's her sensei. This is her fight.

32:53.720 --> 32:56.792
Colleen...

33:17.700 --> 33:22.034
You were right, Bakuto.
I never was cut out to be Hand.

33:25.250 --> 33:26.239
Kill him.

33:28.540 --> 33:32.203
If we kill him, we're no better than them.

33:32.590 --> 33:34.922
So what?
We call the police?

33:35.090 --> 33:37.001
We have enough on him.

33:37.930 --> 33:40.888
He'll be the first leader of the Hand
to ever get arrested.

33:41.470 --> 33:43.267
Danny, we do what we came to do.

33:43.930 --> 33:46.148
Is this really who you want to be?

33:46.600 --> 33:47.589
Hmm?

33:48.480 --> 33:52.109
A living weapon? An assassin for K'un-Lun?

33:53.070 --> 33:55.061
Is that what your father
had in mind for you

33:55.240 --> 33:57.561
when he was raising you to be Danny Rand?

34:00.280 --> 34:05.035
If you kill me, then all you'll ever be
is K'un-Lun's Iron Fist

34:05.540 --> 34:09.032
in a long line of living weapons
whose only purpose

34:09.420 --> 34:11.797
is to be used by others.

34:33.110 --> 34:34.350
You out of your mind?

34:34.570 --> 34:35.776
You're the Iron Fist.

34:36.240 --> 34:40.153
Your duty is to kill the Hand,
not put them in cages.

34:40.450 --> 34:43.442
The rules are different here.
There are consequences.

34:44.120 --> 34:45.860
You can't just go around killing people.

34:46.080 --> 34:47.707
That's not why you didn't do it.

34:49.460 --> 34:53.339
You couldn't, because you haven't
got it in you, Danny.

34:55.050 --> 34:56.335
You're not a warrior.

34:58.180 --> 35:01.001
- You are a failure.
- It's not that srmple!

35:01.180 --> 35:02.841
You of all people don't get a say in this!

35:03.010 --> 35:04.637
Don't talk to her like that.

35:07.310 --> 35:10.768
K'un-Lun would have been better off
if Chodak and Tashi had never found you.

35:34.550 --> 35:37.872
You'd choose this putrid hellhole
over the people who raised you?

35:38.220 --> 35:39.255
Get up!

35:43.390 --> 35:45.802
This has nothing to do with K'un-Lun.

35:47.890 --> 35:49.517
This is because I left you.

36:23.220 --> 36:24.209
Yield.

36:40.360 --> 36:43.238
I kicked your ass back in K'un-Lun
and I kicked your ass here!

36:43.410 --> 36:45.150
Yield!

36:47.080 --> 36:48.149
Danny!

36:48.370 --> 36:50.110
I hurt you. I get it.

36:50.750 --> 36:53.457
It was selfish and wrong of me
to leave without telling you.

36:54.080 --> 36:57.083
But coming here has taught me that
the Iron Fist isn't just for K'un-Lun.

36:57.630 --> 37:00.622
Others before me may have felt
it was their destiny,

37:01.220 --> 37:04.963
but I am Danny Rand,
and I'm the Iron Fist.

37:26.490 --> 37:27.980
I'm sorry.

37:44.130 --> 37:45.461
I wish you could understand.

37:48.010 --> 37:49.170
I never will.

37:52.180 --> 37:54.307
All I know, the way to K'un-Lun is open...

37:55.770 --> 37:57.681
and there's no one guarding the pass.

38:02.360 --> 38:04.430
There will be consequences for this,
brother.

38:29.890 --> 38:31.005
You okay?

38:36.690 --> 38:38.009
I'll work through it.

38:39.770 --> 38:41.977
Holy shit.

38:52.450 --> 38:53.576
You sure he was dead?

38:53.740 --> 38:56.243
He was stabbed in the heart.
There's no way he's alive!

38:56.410 --> 38:58.207
- But how could he...
- His men must have taken him.

38:58.830 --> 39:01.207
They wouldn't want anyone
getting the body of a Hand leader.

39:02.090 --> 39:03.660
Harold came back from the dead...

39:05.590 --> 39:07.046
We should go.

39:25.860 --> 39:28.067
- We need help here!
- What's the injury?

39:28.360 --> 39:31.067
She's been shot. Please, she's my sister.

39:33.200 --> 39:34.269
Hey.

39:34.620 --> 39:37.862
Sign in at the desk. You'll be
notified when she's in stable condition.

39:41.120 --> 39:43.122
Clear the floor, please. Ten-four.

39:48.090 --> 39:49.216
I got this.

40:35.180 --> 40:37.216
I forgot how disgusting people are.

40:47.520 --> 40:48.930
What you did back there,

40:49.820 --> 40:53.108
bringing Bakuto to my home,
siding against me...

40:54.700 --> 40:57.237
I couldn't help but think of
my relationship with my father.

40:58.990 --> 41:03.279
You know, there came a time
when I had to topple the king.

41:06.380 --> 41:08.450
Took a lot of balls to try
and kill me again.

41:11.840 --> 41:15.674
And, uh, now you know my weakness.

41:19.260 --> 41:21.421
- It was a mistake.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

41:22.890 --> 41:24.517
No. No, it was...

41:24.980 --> 41:29.223
It was a mistake to think that anything
could get in the way of the three of us...

41:29.820 --> 41:31.856
taking back control of Rand.

41:33.570 --> 41:34.855
The three of us?

41:36.910 --> 41:39.982
- What about Danny?
- Oh, he's served his purpose.

41:42.120 --> 41:46.454
Whether he kills Bakuto
or Bakuto kills him.

41:58.760 --> 42:00.216
Harold, it's Danny.

42:00.760 --> 42:02.967
Hey, I’m relieved to hear your voice.

42:03.430 --> 42:04.761
What happened with Bakuto?

42:04.940 --> 42:06.430
We've taken care of him.

42:06.770 --> 42:09.102
Oh, so you cut off the head of the snake?

42:09.400 --> 42:10.389
Yeah.

42:11.610 --> 42:13.646
And Joy? How is she?

42:13.940 --> 42:15.237
Well, she's going to surgery.

42:15.400 --> 42:17.106
She'll be fine. All thanks to you.

42:17.610 --> 42:20.329
Good. What hospital are you at?
I'll come over.

42:20.950 --> 42:22.861
No, no need. Ward and l are here.

42:23.040 --> 42:25.326
You should get some rest.
You ’Ve earned it.

42:25.910 --> 42:26.820
Okay.

42:27.870 --> 42:28.950
Where will you be?

42:33.710 --> 42:37.089
I'll be at the Chikara Dojo.
For the time being, anyway.

42:37.300 --> 42:38.289
Excellent.

42:40.140 --> 42:42.597
Hey, there is no way I can repay you,
Danny.

42:42.760 --> 42:47.629
You know, you freed me from the Hand.
I can return to my life.

42:48.600 --> 42:51.854
With my children. All thanks to you.

42:55.070 --> 42:59.154
- You're like family to me.
- Okay. Talk later.

43:07.910 --> 43:10.322
When Bakuto put the cuffs on me,
I...

43:11.250 --> 43:13.491
I had no idea if the Fist
was gonna work or not.

43:14.840 --> 43:16.159
Does this mean you're better?

43:16.840 --> 43:18.580
Let's not go overboard.

43:19.840 --> 43:22.422
Guess it just means I don't want to be
someone's Sack Man.

43:23.350 --> 43:24.339
What?

43:25.390 --> 43:26.596
Never mind.

43:32.150 --> 43:34.311
That whole thing with Davos was...

43:35.690 --> 43:36.679
Ugly.

43:37.030 --> 43:38.019
Yeah.

43:40.990 --> 43:42.617
I really screwed things up with him.

43:45.450 --> 43:47.247
I don't want the same thing
to happen with you.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.740
When my parents died...

43:55.460 --> 43:57.416
I've always felt this need
to find a family.

43:59.050 --> 44:02.178
At first, I...
Ithought it could be in K'un-Lun.

44:03.300 --> 44:05.848
And then, I thought it could be
with the Meachums, but...

44:08.480 --> 44:10.050
But what I found in you is...

44:12.150 --> 44:13.219
It's new.

44:15.230 --> 44:16.390
It's different.

44:18.650 --> 44:19.856
I feel the same.

44:39.420 --> 44:40.580
Come on.

46:58.900 --> 47:00.015
What's wrong?

47:03.320 --> 47:04.776
How does Ward even know where you are?

47:12.830 --> 47:14.730
- No.
- What is he talking about?

47:19.420 --> 47:20.739
Looks like Gao's men.

47:21.750 --> 47:22.876
Or Bakuto's.

47:40.440 --> 47:42.806
Danny! What are they doing here?

47:43.270 --> 47:46.023
Danny Rand! On the ground!

47:46.820 --> 47:47.889
Let's go!
