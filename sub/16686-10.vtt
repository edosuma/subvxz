<i>running a trading company.</i>

03:20.601 --> 03:24.069
And she basically helps to
raise him enough money

03:24.071 --> 03:26.338
so he can get on a ship
and go to the Colonies

03:26.340 --> 03:27.206

<i>Hey, what's up,</i>
<i>I'm Hamilton.</i>

03:53.534 --> 03:56.268
<i>Here are all my letters</i>

04:07.381 --> 04:09.581
<i>So no.</i>

04:09.583 --> 04:11.583
<i>And he says,</i>

<i>you're cool,</i>
<i>Aaron Burr, nice to meet you.</i>

04:13.887 --> 04:15.320

<i>hey, be my aides-de-camp.</i>

04:41.849 --> 04:44.016
Aides-de-camp is, like,
a fancy word for secretary.

<i>I wanna fight, 'cause that's</i>
<i>how I'm gonna rise up.</i>

<i>come work for me.</i>

04:51.558 --> 04:54.159

<i>You're gonna be in the guy--</i>

04:56.697 --> 04:58.196
<i>in with the guy</i>
<i>who knows best.</i>

04:58.198 --> 05:01.800

<i>political calculus and says,</i>

05:01.802 --> 05:02.968
<i>okay.</i>

05:02.970 --> 05:04.770
<i>So Hamilton writes his letters.</i>

05:04.772 --> 05:06.772
<i>Hamilton writes letters</i>
<i>to Congress.</i>

05:06.774 --> 05:09.308
<i>This whole time, all Hamilton</i>
<i>wants is a command.</i>

05:09.310 --> 05:11.410
<i>Hamilton's just, sort of,</i>
<i>tugging on his sleeve,</i>

05:11.412 --> 05:13.045
<i>being like,</i>
<i>can I fight?</i>

05:13.047 --> 05:15.480
<i>Can I--can you just give me,</i>
<i>like, a bunch of dudes</i>

05:15.482 --> 05:19.017
<i>and like, I--I promise</i>
<i>I'll be so good at this.</i>

05:19.019 --> 05:20.052
<i>And Washington's like,</i>

05:20.054 --> 05:22.688
<i>no, just stay aides-de-camp.</i>

05:22.690 --> 05:26.091
<i>But they go through</i>
<i>some of the toughest trials</i>

05:26.093 --> 05:27.025
<i>of the war together.</i>

05:27.027 --> 05:29.227
<i>It's--it's Hamilton</i>
<i>and Washington.</i>

05:29.229 --> 05:30.629
And then Hamilton finally goes,

05:30.631 --> 05:31.797
<i>I quit! I'm out!</i>

05:31.799 --> 05:34.466
And Washington, aware of
what a, sort of,

05:34.468 --> 05:37.436
gifted but troubled kid
Hamilton is,

05:37.438 --> 05:40.072
<i>says, all right,</i>
<i>you're gonna lead these troops</i>

05:40.074 --> 05:41.907

<i>to say you led a command.</i>

06:47.908 --> 06:48.673
Um, they all ask him,

06:48.675 --> 06:51.643
hey, come be a part of
the Constitutional Convention.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.278
<i>So we're figuring out how</i>

06:53.280 --> 06:55.147
<i>the American system</i>
<i>is gonna work.</i>

06:55.149 --> 06:56.248
<i>The Constitutional Convention:</i>

06:56.250 --> 06:57.682
<i>this is the room</i>
<i>where they're deciding</i>

06:57.684 --> 07:00.952
<i>what the shape of our</i>
<i>government should be.</i>

07:00.954 --> 07:02.487
<i>They're hashing it out.</i>

07:02.489 --> 07:04.222
<i>And Hamilton speaks</i>
<i>for six hours.</i>

07:04.224 --> 07:08.226
<i>But some of the things he</i>
<i>pitched would haunt him</i>

07:08.228 --> 07:09.261
<i>the rest of his career.</i>

07:09.263 --> 07:12.097
He pitched
maybe president for life?

07:12.099 --> 07:15.700
<i>[whispering] Ooh, he's secretly</i>
<i>a monarchist.</i>

07:15.702 --> 07:19.971
<i>Maybe, uh, we inherit...</i>

07:19.973 --> 07:20.739
<i>positions.</i>

07:20.741 --> 07:21.973
<i>[whispering]</i>
<i>Bullshit. That's terrible.</i>

07:21.975 --> 07:24.876
<i>This guy just wants</i>
<i>to bring back the British.</i>

07:24.878 --> 07:26.578
Those whispers are from
the perspectives

07:26.580 --> 07:28.713
of, um, people who
don't like him.

07:28.715 --> 07:31.883
<i>Um, but anyway, um, we adopt</i>
<i>the system that we adopt.</i>

07:31.885 --> 07:35.554
<i>And Hamilton becomes</i>
<i>its most ardent defender.</i>

07:38.658 --> 07:40.225
So--

07:40.227 --> 07:44.663
Trying to find the straightest
line through this story.

07:48.401 --> 07:51.069
So Hamilton has an affair.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.038
<i>Um, while he's</i>
<i>the treasury secretary,</i>

07:53.040 --> 07:57.342
<i>he carries on this affair with</i>
<i>a woman named Maria Reynolds.</i>

07:57.344 --> 07:59.744
<i>Her husband shows up.</i>

07:59.746 --> 08:03.615
<i>He's like, yo, uh,</i>
<i>that's my wife.</i>

08:03.617 --> 08:06.585
<i>I'm happy to, like,</i>
<i>keep it on the low,</i>

08:06.587 --> 08:08.820
<i>but you have to pay me.</i>

08:08.822 --> 08:12.891
<i>Gets basically extorted</i>
<i>for about $1,000.</i>

08:14.026 --> 08:17.896
James Reynolds, the husband
who was extorting him,

08:17.898 --> 08:19.764
gets arrested on some
other bullshit.

08:19.766 --> 08:22.501
<i>While he's trying to</i>
<i>weasel his way out of it,</i>

08:22.503 --> 08:25.637
<i>he says, I've got dirt</i>
<i>on Alexander Hamilton.</i>

08:25.639 --> 08:27.839
<i>Everyone goes,</i>
<i>really?</i>

08:27.841 --> 08:30.842
<i>Hamilton, uh, and--</i>
<i>has been embezzling.</i>

08:30.844 --> 08:34.346
And he sort of says
all this shit about Hamilton.

08:34.348 --> 08:38.617
<i>Um, and so three guys</i>
<i>go to confront Hamilton</i>

08:38.619 --> 08:39.384
<i>on these charges.</i>

08:39.386 --> 08:43.321
<i>One of the dudes was future</i>
<i>president James Monroe.</i>

08:43.323 --> 08:45.156
<i>And they went, yo, Hamilton,</i>

08:45.158 --> 08:47.792
<i>we know what you did,</i>
<i>you know what you did.</i>

08:47.794 --> 08:50.395
<i>Check out these checks</i>
<i>to James Reynolds.</i>

08:50.397 --> 08:52.631
<i>What's up?</i>
<i>And they accuse him</i>

08:52.633 --> 08:53.999
<i>of embezzling funds.</i>

08:54.001 --> 08:55.467
<i>And Hamilton goes,</i>
<i>no, no, no.</i>

08:55.469 --> 08:57.435
<i>I was just [bleep] this lady,</i>

08:57.437 --> 08:59.938
<i>and her husband</i>
<i>was hitting me up for money.</i>

08:59.940 --> 09:01.339
<i>I didn't touch American money,</i>

09:01.341 --> 09:02.807
<i>and I have all kinds of proof.</i>

09:02.809 --> 09:07.112
And he, like, vomits information
all over them.

09:07.114 --> 09:10.482
<i>Oh, wow, that was more</i>
<i>than we needed to hear.</i>

09:10.484 --> 09:12.817
<i>And we're good, thanks.</i>

09:12.819 --> 09:16.555
<i>The info about the affair</i>
<i>gets somehow miraculously</i>

09:16.557 --> 09:18.323
<i>printed in the paper.</i>

09:18.325 --> 09:21.660
<i>Hamilton is not a great dude.</i>

09:21.662 --> 09:24.696
<i>I know you think he's great</i>
<i>'cause he's a war vet,</i>

09:24.698 --> 09:26.264
<i>and he's</i>
<i>the Treasury Secretary,</i>

09:26.266 --> 09:30.001
<i>but you're gonna learn the</i>
<i>truth real soon.</i>

09:30.003 --> 09:35.640
<i>And Hamilton gets this</i>
<i>and he goes to James Monroe,</i>

09:35.642 --> 09:36.608
<i>[whispering]</i>
<i>what the [bleep]?</i>

09:36.610 --> 09:38.243
<i>Like, I told you that in</i>
<i>secret.</i>

09:38.245 --> 09:39.311
<i>And James Monroe's like,</i>

09:39.313 --> 09:41.313
<i>it wasn't secret</i>
<i>and it wasn't me.</i>

09:41.315 --> 09:44.382
<i>Wasn't me who--who, uh,</i>
<i>published it.</i>

09:44.384 --> 09:45.150
<i>Mother[bleep]!</i>

09:45.152 --> 09:47.385
<i>I told three people</i>
<i>about this</i>

09:47.387 --> 09:49.487
<i>and you're the one</i>
<i>who was taking notes,</i>

09:49.489 --> 09:52.123
<i>so I know it came from you.</i>

09:52.125 --> 09:54.426
<i>Like...fess up.</i>

09:54.428 --> 09:55.393
<i>[bleep] you.</i>
<i>[bleep] you.</i>

09:55.395 --> 09:58.697
So Hamilton, over sharer,
writes the Reynolds Pamphlet.

09:58.699 --> 10:01.299
The whole thing reads like
a Dear Penthouse letter.

10:01.301 --> 10:03.201
Like, dear America,

10:03.203 --> 10:05.737
<i>I never thought this would</i>
<i>happen to me.</i>

10:05.739 --> 10:09.741
<i>But one day,</i>
<i>this ripped bodice woman</i>

10:09.743 --> 10:11.810
<i>showed up at my door,</i>
<i>saying,</i>

10:11.812 --> 10:14.346
<i>oh, my husband's beating me,</i>
<i>left me alone</i>

10:14.348 --> 10:16.648
<i>and I need money</i>
<i>and I need help.</i>

10:16.650 --> 10:19.351
<i>You are a man of honor.</i>
<i>Can you help me?</i>

10:19.353 --> 10:21.786
<i>Hamilton's like,</i>
<i>I could give her money</i>

10:21.788 --> 10:22.621
<i>or I could [bleep] her</i>

10:22.623 --> 10:24.022
<i>and either one would be</i>
<i>acceptable.</i>

10:24.024 --> 10:26.791
<i>The--the Reynolds Pamphlet</i>
<i>is like Dick 101.</i>

10:26.793 --> 10:29.394
And, by the way,
he sent this to his friends.

10:29.396 --> 10:32.464
<i>Being like, hey,</i>
<i>I think I'm gonna publish this.</i>

10:32.466 --> 10:33.331
<i>And everyone was like,</i>

10:33.333 --> 10:36.034
<i>hey, bro, I don't think</i>
<i>this is a good idea</i>

10:36.036 --> 10:36.701
<i>to publish this.</i>

10:36.703 --> 10:38.970
<i>Like, maybe your wife</i>
<i>and your seven children</i>

10:38.972 --> 10:41.439
<i>would not love it</i>
<i>if you published this.</i>

10:41.441 --> 10:43.174
<i>And Hamilton's like,</i>
<i>well, I mean, like,</i>

10:43.176 --> 10:44.609
<i>I got accused of embezzling.</i>

10:44.611 --> 10:46.378
<i>And, like,</i>
<i>I can't let that stand.</i>

10:46.380 --> 10:50.248
<i>Maybe the, like,</i>
<i>marital infidelity trumps that?</i>

10:50.250 --> 10:51.549
<i>I know it doesn't</i>
<i>in your head,</i>

10:51.551 --> 10:54.586
<i>but to everyone else</i>
<i>in the world it does.</i>

10:54.588 --> 10:58.323
<i>Um, and he's like, no,</i>
<i>I can't let that shit stand.</i>

10:58.325 --> 11:01.126
<i>And Hamilton goes back</i>
<i>to James Monroe</i>

11:01.128 --> 11:02.694
<i>and--and now Hamilton's like,</i>

11:02.696 --> 11:04.129
<i>well, it's all out in the open.</i>

11:04.131 --> 11:05.497
<i>um, and if you still wanna</i>
<i>settle this,</i>

11:05.499 --> 11:07.532
<i>because I know you're the one</i>
<i>who leaked it.</i>

11:07.534 --> 11:08.933
<i>Um, Monroe's like,</i>
<i>well, I didn't leak it,</i>

11:08.935 --> 11:12.537
<i>but if you wanna, like, fight,</i>
<i>like, let's do this.</i>

11:13.873 --> 11:14.906
<i>And so they meet face to face.</i>

11:14.908 --> 11:17.809
<i>And Monroe goes,</i>
<i>all right, you're mad at me</i>

11:17.811 --> 11:19.010
<i>because of this,</i>
<i>this, and this.</i>

11:19.012 --> 11:21.279
<i>And Hamilton goes,</i>
<i>let's start at the beginning.</i>

11:21.281 --> 11:25.016
And lists, like, the first time
they met. [laughs]

11:25.018 --> 11:26.951
He lists the details
of the entire meeting,

11:26.953 --> 11:29.354
<i>as Monroe gets more and more</i>
<i>impatient.</i>

11:29.356 --> 11:32.724
<i>Monroe's like, I know all this,</i>
<i>I know all this.</i>

11:32.726 --> 11:34.359
<i>I know all this.</i>

11:34.361 --> 11:37.529
<i>Hamilton's like,</i>
<i>you interrupted me.</i>

11:37.531 --> 11:38.496
<i>I have to start again.</i>

11:38.498 --> 11:39.798
<i>And Monroe's getting</i>
<i>angrier and angrier,</i>

11:39.800 --> 11:41.099
until they're finally
pulled apart.

11:41.101 --> 11:44.369
'Cause they're about to, like,
punch each other in the face.

11:44.371 --> 11:47.272
<i>So Monroe goes to his homey,</i>
<i>Aaron Burr.</i>

11:47.274 --> 11:50.075
<i>And goes, yo,</i>
<i>you know Hamilton,</i>

11:50.077 --> 11:51.176
<i>will you tell him--</i>

11:51.178 --> 11:54.245
this is so, like,
high school gossip.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.247
<i>He goes,</i>
<i>will you tell Hamilton</i>

11:56.249 --> 11:59.617
<i>that if he's challenging me</i>
<i>to a duel, I accept.</i>

11:59.619 --> 12:03.888
<i>But if he's not, I wasn't</i>
<i>challenging him to a duel.</i>

12:03.890 --> 12:07.659
<i>And Burr goes</i>
<i>over to Hamilton, like,</i>

12:07.661 --> 12:09.828
<i>James Monroe told me</i>
<i>to tell you</i>

12:09.830 --> 12:12.130
<i>that if you're challenging him,</i>
<i>he accepts,</i>

12:12.132 --> 12:13.565
<i>but if you weren't</i>
<i>challenging him,</i>

12:13.567 --> 12:16.401
<i>he doesn't really</i>
<i>wanna go into a duel.</i>

12:16.403 --> 12:18.703
Uh, and Burr
squashes the duel.

12:18.705 --> 12:21.172
<i>Burr's like,</i>
<i>duels are stupid.</i>

12:21.174 --> 12:24.976
<i>And you both should just,</i>
<i>like shut up.</i>

12:24.978 --> 12:25.710
<i>And it's over.</i>

12:25.712 --> 12:28.346
<i>And Hamilton told everyone</i>
<i>everything, anyway.</i>

12:28.348 --> 12:30.749
<i>So there's no point in</i>
<i>you shooting at each other.</i>

12:30.751 --> 12:31.916
<i>[cell phone beeps]</i>
<i>Sorry, I forgot</i>

12:31.918 --> 12:33.151
<i>to put my phone on vibrate.</i>

12:33.153 --> 12:34.452
<i>- Yeah, okay.</i>

12:34.454 --> 12:37.055
<i>- Uh-oh, Questlove's--</i>
- Questlove?

12:37.057 --> 12:37.989
- Texting me.

12:37.991 --> 12:39.424
"You did 'Drunk History'?"

12:39.426 --> 12:41.292
What? How did Questlove
find out?

12:41.294 --> 12:42.794
- Oh, here we go.

12:42.796 --> 12:45.263
<i>- Yo!</i>
- Questlove!

12:45.265 --> 12:47.332
<i>- Yo! [laughs]</i>

12:47.334 --> 12:48.399
<i>[both laugh]</i>

12:48.401 --> 12:51.302
- Look at this.
<i>- This is the best shit ever!</i>

12:51.304 --> 12:53.338
<i>I cannot wait</i>
<i>for this episode.</i>

12:53.340 --> 12:55.907
<i>My girl and I got together</i>
<i>based on our love</i>

12:55.909 --> 12:56.674
<i>for "Drunk History."</i>

12:56.676 --> 12:58.476
- You see the effect you have?
- Well--

12:58.478 --> 12:59.110
I love you both.

12:59.112 --> 13:02.680
- ♪ History has its eyes
on you ♪

13:02.682 --> 13:04.382
- Yes.
<i>- This is awesome!</i>

13:04.384 --> 13:05.583
<i>- Cheers.</i>
<i>- Bye, Questo.</i>

13:05.585 --> 13:07.051
<i>- All right, bye.</i>

13:11.891 --> 13:13.691
<i>- How drunk are you?</i>
<i>- Very.</i>

13:13.693 --> 13:15.727
<i>- [laughs]</i>
- Where are you guys?

13:15.729 --> 13:19.097
What car are you in?
What even is happening?

13:19.099 --> 13:21.299
<i>- Yo, film him now.</i>
- [laughs]

13:21.301 --> 13:22.267
- We are.
- They are.

13:22.269 --> 13:23.434
- Uh, you can't see.
- Look.

13:23.436 --> 13:26.671
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Hey, what's up, ya'll?</i>

13:26.673 --> 13:28.072
<i>[laughs]</i>
- I think you're great.

13:28.074 --> 13:30.241
You're my fav--you're my best--
<i>- I am too, man.</i>

13:30.243 --> 13:31.309
both: You're my best friend.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.944
- Say it! Say it.
You're my best friend.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.646
- You're my best friend.
- [laughs]

13:34.648 --> 13:35.513
<i>- I love you. [laughs]</i>

13:35.515 --> 13:37.515
<i>I love you, Lin!</i>
- Long as I got a job,

13:37.517 --> 13:38.550
you got a job, bye.

13:38.552 --> 13:39.884
<i>- Try hard, homey,</i>
<i>try hard.</i>

13:39.886 --> 13:42.453
- Long as I got a job,
you got a job.

13:42.455 --> 13:43.454
<i>- [laughs]</i>

13:43.456 --> 13:45.723
[both laugh]

13:49.728 --> 13:52.096
- [whispering]
I wanna order Dominos.

13:52.098 --> 13:54.699
Um--

13:54.701 --> 13:55.600
Okay.

13:55.602 --> 13:57.268
<i>So Hamilton and Burr,</i>

13:57.270 --> 13:58.336
<i>they're contemporaries.</i>

13:58.338 --> 13:59.504
<i>And they're colleagues.</i>

13:59.506 --> 14:02.106
<i>And they're friends</i>
<i>until they're not.</i>

14:02.108 --> 14:05.543
<i>They're cool until</i>
<i>Burr runs against</i>

14:05.545 --> 14:07.612
<i>Hamilton's father-in-law</i>
<i>for Senate.</i>

14:07.614 --> 14:09.614
<i>And he wins.</i>
<i>And Hamilton's like,</i>

14:09.616 --> 14:11.616
<i>yo, I thought we were friends.</i>

14:11.618 --> 14:12.417
<i>We are friends.</i>

14:12.419 --> 14:14.552
<i>I ran against your</i>
<i>father-in-law, he was weak.</i>

14:14.554 --> 14:15.253
<i>And I won.</i>

14:15.255 --> 14:16.988
<i>Like, why can't we still</i>
<i>be friends?</i>

14:16.990 --> 14:19.757
<i>'Cause that was my</i>
<i>[bleep] father-in-law.</i>

14:19.759 --> 14:23.394
<i>And now we're enemies.</i>

14:23.396 --> 14:25.196
Um, all right.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.065
Let's flash forward.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.266
<i>Burr runs for president</i>

14:28.268 --> 14:31.569
<i>against Hamilton's arch</i>
<i>nemesis, Thomas Jefferson.</i>

14:31.571 --> 14:34.639
<i>It was a tie between</i>
<i>Jefferson and Burr.</i>

14:34.641 --> 14:35.673
<i>And people went to Hamilton.</i>

14:35.675 --> 14:39.410
<i>And they said, hey, should we</i>
<i>vote for Burr or Jefferson?</i>

14:39.412 --> 14:42.080
<i>Hamilton was like,</i>
<i>blah, blah, blah, blah</i>

14:42.082 --> 14:43.748
blah, blah, blah, blah--no!

14:43.750 --> 14:46.317
<i>Vote for Jefferson.</i>
<i>I disagree with him,</i>

14:46.319 --> 14:47.752
<i>at least he has an ethos.</i>

14:47.754 --> 14:52.290
<i>He said, if pressed,</i>
<i>if pressed,</i>

14:52.292 --> 14:53.992
<i>like a juice.</i>
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

14:53.994 --> 14:56.761
<i>- I don't know what the [bleep]</i>
<i>Burr stands for.</i>

14:56.763 --> 14:59.264
<i>And I've known Burr</i>
<i>all my life.</i>

14:59.266 --> 15:02.233
<i>And Jefferson wins</i>
<i>because of Hamilton.</i>

15:02.235 --> 15:07.672
<i>So Burr's vice president,</i>
<i>he doesn't got shit to do.</i>

15:07.674 --> 15:08.706
<i>Like, Thomas Jefferson's like,</i>

15:08.708 --> 15:10.742
<i>I trust you about as far</i>
<i>as I can throw you,</i>

15:10.744 --> 15:12.577
<i>and I can't throw things</i>
<i>very far.</i>

15:12.579 --> 15:14.812
<i>I have slaves</i>
<i>who do that for me.</i>

15:14.814 --> 15:17.248
<i>So Burr is suddenly</i>
<i>on the other side</i>

15:17.250 --> 15:19.550
of this brush with greatness.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.052
And he's got nothing.

15:21.054 --> 15:21.819
No one trusts him.

15:21.821 --> 15:23.087
<i>And he looks around</i>
<i>and he goes,</i>

15:23.089 --> 15:28.059
<i>why don't I have</i>
<i>a career in this country</i>

15:28.061 --> 15:31.029
<i>I helped fight for</i>
<i>and die for and--</i>

15:31.031 --> 15:32.030
He didn't die for it, but--

15:32.032 --> 15:35.633
Like, I helped build this thing,
and why am I--

15:35.635 --> 15:37.268
<i>Why is my political career</i>
<i>over?</i>

15:37.270 --> 15:40.538
<i>And he looks around and the</i>
<i>only answer he has is Hamilton.</i>

15:40.540 --> 15:44.943
Hamilton talked shit about Burr
all the time.

15:44.945 --> 15:48.246
<i>So Burr writes a letter</i>
<i>to Hamilton.</i>

15:48.248 --> 15:51.683
<i>Dear Alexander Hamilton,</i>
<i>mother[bleep].</i>

15:51.685 --> 15:53.251
<i>Hamilton responds with,</i>

15:53.253 --> 15:54.953
<i>Burr, mother[bleep].</i>

15:54.955 --> 15:59.624
<i>Burr: mother[bleep].</i>
<i>Apologize for what you said,</i>

15:59.626 --> 16:02.160
<i>or meet me on the field</i>
<i>for combat.</i>

16:02.162 --> 16:05.763
<i>Hamilton: I don't want it to go</i>
<i>down like this.</i>

16:05.765 --> 16:06.597
<i>I really don't.</i>

16:06.599 --> 16:08.533
<i>But I can't apologize</i>
<i>for what I said,</i>

16:08.535 --> 16:10.501
<i>so I guess I'll see you there.</i>

16:10.503 --> 16:12.437
<i>- Again, this feels</i>
<i>like high school.</i>

16:12.439 --> 16:14.672
<i>- Totally high school.</i>

16:14.674 --> 16:16.541
Well, you know what?
Here's an interesting story

16:16.543 --> 16:19.310
that we haven't
talked about yet.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.612
A couple of days
before the final duel,

16:21.614 --> 16:23.848
<i>Hamilton and Burr are at</i>
<i>the same party.</i>

16:23.850 --> 16:27.952
<i>And by all accounts,</i>
<i>Burr was sulking in the corner</i>

16:27.954 --> 16:31.022
<i>and Hamilton was standing</i>
<i>on the bar,</i>

16:31.024 --> 16:33.691
<i>leading his friends</i>
<i>in a song.</i>

16:33.693 --> 16:34.926
<i>- And the song was?</i>

16:34.928 --> 16:36.861
<i>- I don't know.</i>
- Right, we don't know.

16:36.863 --> 16:39.797
Every new beginning comes from
some other beginning's end.

16:39.799 --> 16:44.402
both: ♪ I know who I
want to take me home ♪

16:44.404 --> 16:45.737
- That was my graduation song.

16:45.739 --> 16:48.373
Like, I remember,
thinking, like, man--

16:48.375 --> 16:49.173
You know--
[plays piano]

16:49.175 --> 16:51.376
It's a metaphor for everything.
- Yeah.

16:51.378 --> 16:51.943
[laughs]

16:51.945 --> 16:55.079
<i>And this is</i>
<i>the last night, guys.</i>

16:55.081 --> 16:56.581
<i>The last night.</i>

16:59.318 --> 17:03.521
both: ♪ I know who
I want to take me home ♪

17:03.523 --> 17:07.725
<i>♪ I know who</i>
<i>I want to take me home ♪</i>

17:07.727 --> 17:09.660
- ♪ With me ♪
- ♪ I know who ♪

17:09.662 --> 17:12.497
both: ♪ I want to take me home ♪

17:12.499 --> 17:14.198
♪ Take me home ♪

17:14.200 --> 17:18.836
- ♪ My new born ♪
- ♪ New boy ♪

17:18.838 --> 17:26.778
[both laugh]

17:26.780 --> 17:29.213
- [laughs] So--
where was I?

17:29.215 --> 17:30.615
- We're gonna duel it out.

17:30.617 --> 17:34.352
- 1804, four, four, four, four.

17:34.354 --> 17:36.888
<i>So we're here. We're on</i>
<i>the grounds at Weehawken.</i>

17:36.890 --> 17:40.291
<i>From Burr's perspective,</i>
<i>there's no reason to think</i>

17:40.293 --> 17:42.126
<i>Hamilton won't fire at him.</i>

17:42.128 --> 17:43.394
<i>Hamilton shows up</i>
<i>wearing glasses.</i>

17:43.396 --> 17:47.465
<i>Hamilton is checking out his</i>
<i>gun pretty intently.</i>

17:47.467 --> 17:50.435
<i>Burr's like,</i>
<i>this mother[bleep] right here</i>

17:50.437 --> 17:51.769
<i>talked shit about me</i>
<i>my whole career.</i>

17:51.771 --> 17:53.905
<i>Basically stopped me</i>
<i>from being elected</i>

17:53.907 --> 17:55.373
<i>President of the United States.</i>

17:55.375 --> 17:57.275
<i>This guy has opposed me</i>
<i>at every turn.</i>

17:57.277 --> 18:00.244
<i>When I look back at my career,</i>
<i>he's the one in the way.</i>

18:00.246 --> 18:02.280
<i>He's got his [bleep]</i>
<i>glasses on.</i>

18:02.282 --> 18:06.017
<i>This guy is checking out his</i>
<i>gun pretty intently.</i>

18:06.019 --> 18:08.019
<i>This mother[bleep]</i>
<i>is gonna kill me</i>

18:08.021 --> 18:10.588
<i>if I don't kill him first.</i>

18:10.590 --> 18:15.359
So, um,
they get to that moment.

18:15.361 --> 18:17.662
<i>They meet.</i>

18:17.664 --> 18:20.431
<i>They count their paces.</i>

18:20.433 --> 18:21.532
<i>They turn and fire.</i>

18:21.534 --> 18:25.036
<i>Burr aims forward,</i>
<i>Hamilton aims up.</i>

18:25.038 --> 18:29.140
<i>Burr's bullet strikes Hamilton</i>
<i>right between his ribs.</i>

18:32.211 --> 18:35.213
<i>The first thing that happened</i>
<i>was Burr rushed over</i>

18:35.215 --> 18:36.581
<i>to talk to Hamilton.</i>

18:36.583 --> 18:37.849
<i>And his second held him back.</i>

18:37.851 --> 18:39.884
<i>No, I have to go</i>
<i>talk to Hamilton.</i>

18:39.886 --> 18:41.719
<i>And his second is like,</i>
<i>no, no, no.</i>

18:41.721 --> 18:45.556
<i>You forfeit the right to talk</i>
<i>to Hamilton when you shot him.</i>

18:45.558 --> 18:46.657
<i>You gotta get back</i>
<i>to New York.</i>

18:46.659 --> 18:49.527
<i>You gotta get, like,</i>
<i>away from the scene</i>

18:49.529 --> 18:51.562
<i>as quickly as possible.</i>

18:55.634 --> 18:58.136
<i>Hamilton gets rowed back</i>
<i>across the river.</i>

18:58.138 --> 19:02.907
<i>He gets taken to a doctor's</i>
<i>office on Maiden Lane.</i>

19:02.909 --> 19:07.044
<i>And Hamilton dies</i>
<i>the next day.</i>

19:07.046 --> 19:07.912
<i>But here's the thing:</i>

19:07.914 --> 19:11.549
<i>Hamilton writes letters</i>
<i>before the final duel.</i>

19:11.551 --> 19:14.185
<i>In his last act of political--</i>

19:14.187 --> 19:18.022
I don't know if it's genius
or [bleep] you-itiveness.

19:18.024 --> 19:19.323
<i>He damns Burr for life.</i>

19:19.325 --> 19:21.659
<i>He wrote a bunch</i>
<i>of [bleep] letters, saying,</i>

19:21.661 --> 19:23.561
<i>listen, I have to go</i>
<i>to this duel with Aaron Burr,</i>

19:23.563 --> 19:26.664
<i>but I want you to know</i>
<i>that I'm a good Christian.</i>

19:26.666 --> 19:28.833
<i>I'm not gonna fire on him.</i>

19:28.835 --> 19:31.235
<i>I'm gonna waste my shot</i>
<i>in the air.</i>

19:31.237 --> 19:32.570
<i>I never meant to kill Burr,</i>

19:32.572 --> 19:37.942
<i>and if Burr killed me,</i>
<i>he's the asshole. [laughs]</i>

19:37.944 --> 19:40.444
<i>And so history's eyes</i>
<i>turn on Burr.</i>

19:40.446 --> 19:44.215
<i>Whether Hamilton lived or died,</i>
<i>he won the duel.</i>

19:44.217 --> 19:46.284
<i>And so, Hamilton wins.</i>

19:46.286 --> 19:48.786
He wins in a,
"200 years later,

19:48.788 --> 19:53.090
<i>they're writing musicals where</i>
<i>I'm a martyr" type way.</i>

19:54.459 --> 19:57.595
<i>And so Burr's the monster.</i>

19:57.597 --> 19:59.130
<i>And what's ironic about that</i>

19:59.132 --> 20:01.699
<i>is Burr was never the monster.</i>
<i>- Never.</i>

20:01.701 --> 20:03.868
<i>- Burr was the cautious</i>
<i>mother[bleep]</i>

20:03.870 --> 20:05.870
<i>who never let</i>
<i>his opinion be known.</i>

20:05.872 --> 20:07.605
<i>And Hamilton was the reckless</i>
<i>mother[bleep]</i>

20:07.607 --> 20:10.174
<i>who let his opinion</i>
<i>be known about everything.</i>

20:10.176 --> 20:13.945
<i>And in the one moment</i>
<i>where it counted most,</i>

20:13.947 --> 20:18.950
<i>Hamilton was cautious</i>
<i>and Burr was reckless.</i>

20:18.952 --> 20:19.550
<i>Oh.</i>

20:19.552 --> 20:23.988
<i>And that defined</i>
<i>their legacies forever.</i>

20:23.990 --> 20:27.091
It's [bleep] up.
- It's really [bleep] up.

20:27.093 --> 20:29.360
Mm-hmm.
- Um--

20:32.631 --> 20:34.265
[laughs]

20:34.267 --> 20:35.233
Right--

20:35.235 --> 20:36.167
[chuckles]

20:36.169 --> 20:37.235
- Ready--
- So what do I have to do

20:37.237 --> 20:38.903
to get a part in this movie?
[laughs]

20:38.905 --> 20:40.871
- You already got it.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.601
- Our founding fathers
