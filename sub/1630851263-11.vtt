00:39.343 --> 00:40.779
Good news, Titans.

00:40.823 --> 00:42.235
We no longer
have to suffer the miseries

00:42.259 --> 00:43.478
of this infernal tower.

00:43.521 --> 00:46.046
We are moving out.

00:46.089 --> 00:47.873
Moving out of the Tower?

00:47.917 --> 00:50.180
But the Tower is our home.

00:50.224 --> 00:51.790
Are you sure
you're feeling okay?

00:51.834 --> 00:54.228
Something seems off
about you, bro.

00:54.271 --> 00:56.230
Yeah, you're looking
kind of janky.

00:56.273 --> 00:57.492
Janky?

00:57.535 --> 00:58.971
I know not of what you speak.

00:59.015 --> 01:01.887
Now, make haste and pack
your carrying cases.

01:01.931 --> 01:03.106
Fine, you're the boss.

01:03.150 --> 01:04.803
- Whatever.
- Sadness.

01:04.847 --> 01:07.589
I'm warning you.
I'm gonna be
grumpy all day now.

01:07.632 --> 01:09.199
All day!

01:11.158 --> 01:13.377
Goodbye, the Tower.

01:13.421 --> 01:15.118
We will miss you.

01:16.859 --> 01:19.688
I still don't even understand
why's we moving out.

01:20.993 --> 01:22.299
Did he just lock us out?

01:22.343 --> 01:24.345
Hey! You guys!
Help me!

01:25.868 --> 01:27.609
It is friend Robin.

01:27.652 --> 01:30.133
But if that's Robin,
who that other Robin?

01:30.177 --> 01:31.743
He must be an imposter.

01:31.787 --> 01:33.180
Yes.

01:33.223 --> 01:34.877
Obviously, whoever's
behind this evil act

01:34.920 --> 01:36.966
wanted to target
the weakest member
of our team.

01:37.009 --> 01:39.447
Hey, I'm not the weakest.

01:39.490 --> 01:41.797
We have been tricked
into leaving the Tower.

01:41.840 --> 01:44.582
That janky-looking Robin
is gonna get it.

01:44.626 --> 01:45.975
Ow!

01:46.018 --> 01:47.324
Titans, go!

01:53.678 --> 01:56.159
All right.
Where is this impostor?

01:58.553 --> 02:01.251
Wait. You guys thought
that was me?

02:02.122 --> 02:03.732
I don't know.

02:03.775 --> 02:04.796
I thought you were having
a bad hair day or something.

02:04.820 --> 02:06.387
I don't have bad hair days.

02:06.430 --> 02:10.086
The janky Robin,
reveal your true identity.

02:13.742 --> 02:14.742
Toads!

02:15.613 --> 02:17.528
It may seem rather bizarre,

02:17.572 --> 02:19.574
but yes, yes, toads we are.

02:19.617 --> 02:21.793
My name is Croak,

02:21.837 --> 02:23.447
leader of these toads.

02:23.491 --> 02:25.319
You were trying to steal
the Tower from us.

02:25.362 --> 02:27.408
No, this is our tower.

02:27.451 --> 02:30.019
Our tower it be.
We lived here first.

02:30.062 --> 02:31.934
We are the rightful owners,
you see?

02:31.977 --> 02:34.589
Yes, yes. Before it
was the Titans Tower,

02:34.632 --> 02:37.722
<i>it was once the Toad Tower.</i>

02:37.766 --> 02:41.161
<i>For years, we lived
a happy and peaceful life.</i>

02:41.204 --> 02:43.859
Whoa. The T doesn't
stand for Titans?

02:43.902 --> 02:45.252
It stands for Toads?

02:46.514 --> 02:48.124
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:48.168 --> 02:50.257
You've been living here
the whole time we have?

02:50.300 --> 02:52.433
- Oh!
- Yes, yes, it is true.

02:52.476 --> 02:55.479
We've been trying
to get rid of you
this whole time, too.

02:55.523 --> 02:57.612
<i>Remember the time
the TV stopped working?</i>

02:58.917 --> 03:00.484
<i>That was us.</i>

03:00.528 --> 03:02.048
<i>Remember the time
the couch fell apart?</i>

03:02.704 --> 03:04.314
<i>That was us.</i>

03:04.358 --> 03:06.011
<i>Remember the time
the elevator broke down?</i>

03:14.150 --> 03:15.891
<i>That was us.</i>

03:15.934 --> 03:17.980
All of it was caused by us.

03:18.023 --> 03:19.460
For eight years,

03:19.503 --> 03:21.505
we've tried to get you
to leave the Tower.

03:21.549 --> 03:23.290
Well, it's time for you to go.

03:23.333 --> 03:25.161
This might have been
your tower once,

03:25.205 --> 03:26.249
but it's ours now.

03:26.293 --> 03:28.208
We have the deed to prove it.

03:28.251 --> 03:29.296
Hey!

03:32.473 --> 03:34.407
You think it's yours
and that's where
you're wrong.

03:34.431 --> 03:38.000
Listen closely, Titans,
as I sing you this song.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.135

I'd like to see you try.

04:18.083 --> 04:20.695
Ain't no toads going to
kick us out of our tower.

04:22.479 --> 04:24.133
Oh!

04:24.176 --> 04:27.005
My little toady heart
cannot handle such violence.

04:27.049 --> 04:30.400
Oh, I think it's the big one.

04:30.444 --> 04:33.708
Here I come,
big burrow in the sky.

04:33.751 --> 04:35.666
I think we have hurt him

04:35.710 --> 04:37.712
without landing the single blow.

04:37.755 --> 04:40.280
I feel kind of bad now.

04:40.323 --> 04:42.673
Goodbye.

04:44.893 --> 04:46.373
Oh, poor little guy.

04:46.416 --> 04:48.157
Do you need medical
attention or something?

04:48.200 --> 04:50.899
Oh, I appreciate your concern,

04:50.942 --> 04:52.683
but I'd really just
like some space

04:52.727 --> 04:54.424
during this difficult time.

04:54.468 --> 04:56.470
We completely understand.

04:56.513 --> 04:57.601
Come on, guys.

04:57.645 --> 04:58.776
Let's step outside.

04:58.820 --> 05:01.475
And please take your bags.

05:04.826 --> 05:07.219
I sure hope the little guy
pulls through.

05:07.263 --> 05:08.786
What is wrong with us?

05:08.830 --> 05:10.875
Picking on
a helpless little toad.

05:10.919 --> 05:12.747
We're monsters.

05:14.183 --> 05:16.664
Toad Tower! Toad Tower!
Toad Tower!

05:16.707 --> 05:18.143
Whoo! What's my name?

05:18.187 --> 05:19.362
- Croak!
- What's my name?

05:19.406 --> 05:20.798
- Croak!
- Yeah!

05:22.322 --> 05:23.801
Have we again been tricked

05:23.845 --> 05:25.803
into doing the leaving
of the Tower?

05:25.847 --> 05:27.457
Yes, I believe we have.

05:27.501 --> 05:29.503
Man, those toads are clever.

05:39.208 --> 05:40.165
Okay, toads.

05:40.209 --> 05:42.037
- It's...
- Shh!

05:42.080 --> 05:44.735
- Uh, can you just...
- You're ruining the best part.

05:45.649 --> 05:46.781
Oh, sorry.

05:52.874 --> 05:55.790
That's enough! It's time
for you toads to leave.

05:56.921 --> 05:58.314
No, no.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.969
It is you who soon
will want to leave.

06:03.580 --> 06:05.016
Uh, what's that?

06:05.060 --> 06:07.018
A magic toad stone, of course.

06:07.062 --> 06:09.543
With this stone,
I can turn any place

06:09.586 --> 06:12.894
into a toxic work environment.

06:12.937 --> 06:16.724
Oh, shiny toad stone,
with your magical gleam,

06:16.767 --> 06:21.642
release your noxious toxins
on this Titans team.

06:26.908 --> 06:29.737
Your magic has no power
over us, Croak.

06:29.780 --> 06:32.435
Titans, let's take out
the trash.

06:32.479 --> 06:33.479
Roger that!

06:36.352 --> 06:38.267
No, not that kind of trash.

06:38.310 --> 06:39.921
Not what kind of trash?

06:39.964 --> 06:43.359
Wait. So we're
not taking out
the actual trash?

06:43.403 --> 06:45.666
No, I meant it figuratively.

06:45.709 --> 06:47.929
We're taking out the toads.

06:47.972 --> 06:50.061
Then why not simply say that?

06:50.105 --> 06:52.716
Your workplacecommunication is the poor.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.370
No, it's not.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.546
My workplace communication
is rich with awesomeness.

06:56.590 --> 06:57.939
Why are you yelling at us?

06:57.982 --> 07:00.463
Uh, major abuse of power, bro.

07:00.507 --> 07:01.769
I'm sorry.

07:01.812 --> 07:03.466
It must be the magic toad stone.

07:03.510 --> 07:06.600
It turned the tower
into a toxic work environment.

07:06.643 --> 07:08.863
Right. Blame it on
the toad stone.

07:08.906 --> 07:10.865
No one ever takes
responsibility around here.

07:10.908 --> 07:14.346
Hey, I'm taking responsibility
by taking out the trash.

07:14.390 --> 07:15.783
Forget the trash!

07:15.826 --> 07:18.220
I is feeling very
undervalued right now.

07:18.263 --> 07:19.917
Yeah, me too.

07:19.961 --> 07:22.001
I spent a lot of time
separating out the recyclable.

07:23.007 --> 07:24.922
I am the one
that did the separating.

07:24.966 --> 07:27.248
Why are you taking
the credit for the work
that I have done?

07:27.272 --> 07:29.884
Because it's a toxic
work environment.

07:29.927 --> 07:31.538
The morale is so low.

07:31.581 --> 07:34.410
I cannot work in this toxic
environment anymore.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.716
- I am out.
- I quits.

07:35.759 --> 07:37.195
Me too.

07:37.239 --> 07:39.328
I expect
the package of severance.

07:40.764 --> 07:42.244
Titans out.

07:44.115 --> 07:46.378
We got tricked into leaving
the tower again, didn't we?

07:46.422 --> 07:47.422
Yup.

07:49.033 --> 07:51.775
This means the war!

07:55.039 --> 07:56.867
The tower is ours.

07:56.911 --> 07:58.173
Titans Tower!

08:00.175 --> 08:02.569
Wrong. The tower is ours.

08:02.612 --> 08:03.918
Toad Tower!

08:05.310 --> 08:07.095
Both of you are wrong.

08:07.138 --> 08:11.839
Before, it was a Toad Tower,
it was the Turkey Tower.

08:14.058 --> 08:17.627
We are here to reclaim
our Tax Accountant Tower.

08:20.587 --> 08:23.241
Toilet tower blocks
of the tribe of toilets.

08:25.896 --> 08:27.724
Silence!

08:27.768 --> 08:30.128
Thunder clouds are the rightful
owners of the Thunder Tower.

08:31.075 --> 08:33.774
Ah, great! Now we
have to fight
toads, turkeys,

08:33.817 --> 08:36.211
tax accountants, toilets
and thunderclouds?

08:36.254 --> 08:38.126
And that's not all.

08:40.607 --> 08:43.392
So it was originally
the Tyrannosaurus Tower?

08:43.435 --> 08:46.569
He's so big.
What could he have
used the tower for?

08:51.139 --> 08:53.663
Whoa! That <i>T. rex
rocks so hard.</i>

08:55.970 --> 08:58.668
Perhaps moving out of the tower
is the good idea.

08:58.712 --> 09:00.235
We are not moving out!

09:00.278 --> 09:01.541
There's only one way

09:01.584 --> 09:03.151
to determine the rightful owner.

09:03.194 --> 09:06.110
<i>It's time for
a T Tower Showdown.</i>

09:36.488 --> 09:37.838
Only one left.

09:41.537 --> 09:44.148
Extinction beam!

09:46.673 --> 09:48.675
Whoo!

09:48.718 --> 09:51.503
Looks like
all the dirty work is done.

09:52.461 --> 09:54.245
Ha, ha. We win!

09:54.289 --> 09:58.162
The T stands for Toad.
In your face, lousy teens.

09:58.206 --> 09:59.773
Whoa. Hey!

10:03.211 --> 10:04.647
What the...

10:04.691 --> 10:07.215
- The T Tower is actually...
- The J Tower?

10:07.258 --> 10:08.651
What does the J stand for?

10:08.695 --> 10:10.044
It stands for me.

10:12.786 --> 10:15.527
'90s sitcom star, Jaleel White?

10:15.571 --> 10:17.878
You mean, it's the Jaleel Tower?

10:17.921 --> 10:18.921
That's right.

10:26.016 --> 10:27.452
Did I do that?
