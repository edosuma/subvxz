00:01.535 --> 00:04.204
-(dance music playing)
-NADJA: What can I say?

00:04.238 --> 00:06.039
The nightclub has really
taken off recently.

00:06.073 --> 00:08.308
Nadja's has become the hot spot

00:08.342 --> 00:11.078
for the tri-state area
vampire community.

00:11.111 --> 00:12.646
And I, its queen.

00:12.679 --> 00:15.282
Most of the vampires lining up
won't get in

00:15.315 --> 00:17.084
due to general ugliness. Move!

00:17.117 --> 00:19.386
Okay, you two in the denim
capes, it ain't happening.

00:19.419 --> 00:21.488
Fly back to New Jersey.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.725
NADJA:
This place has even started
attracting human celebrities,

00:24.758 --> 00:26.760
which is really great
for business.

00:26.793 --> 00:28.128
There's three of them now.

00:28.162 --> 00:29.563
Sofia, you stupid bitch,

00:29.596 --> 00:31.665
when are you gonna put me
in one of your movies?

00:31.698 --> 00:34.067
I want to show the camera
my bling ring. (laughs)

00:34.101 --> 00:35.435
JIM:
Hey, Colin really is

00:35.469 --> 00:37.070
performing tonight, right?

00:37.104 --> 00:38.405
We are very excited, man.

00:38.438 --> 00:40.240
We've been hearing
about him for weeks.

00:40.274 --> 00:42.509
Colin is going to be on stage
in three minutes.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.011
Great, that kid is incredible.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.512
More than a star,
he's a phenomenon.

00:45.546 --> 00:48.182
He does have a certain
je ne sais quoi. (laughs)

00:48.215 --> 00:49.983
(speaking French)

00:52.753 --> 00:54.688
He must have brain scrambles.
That was utter gibberish.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.523
-(laughs)
-SOFIA: Can I just ask you,

00:56.557 --> 01:00.060
what's the "Celebrity Special,"
and is it really $5,000?

01:00.093 --> 01:03.197
Oh, the Celebrity Special!

01:03.230 --> 01:04.565
Something you're interested in?

01:04.598 --> 01:06.233
-Yes, very much.
-Yes, please.
-Jim?

01:06.266 --> 01:07.768
Oh, not for me.
We're shooting in the morning.

01:07.801 --> 01:09.570
And, really, I don't make
that kind of money.

01:09.603 --> 01:13.473
Oh. Celebrity Special
for two, anyone?

01:13.507 --> 01:15.576
-(shouting, cheering)
-NADJA: Okay, uh...

01:15.609 --> 01:16.376
You two, over here.

01:16.410 --> 01:19.112
May I present for you

01:19.146 --> 01:21.615
the Celebrity Special?

01:21.648 --> 01:23.217
It's to die for.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.320
(cheering)

01:26.353 --> 01:27.588
Oh, shit, that looks so real.

01:27.621 --> 01:29.456
NADJA:
It's so much more fun

01:29.489 --> 01:32.025
when the celebrities actually
ask for it themselves.

01:32.059 --> 01:33.160
He's empty.

01:33.193 --> 01:35.429
Come on, you guys.
You are really good.

01:35.462 --> 01:36.630
That is amazing.

01:36.663 --> 01:39.132
-(chanting): Do the head.
-That's right.

01:39.166 --> 01:42.002
-Do the head...
-(cheering)

01:43.136 --> 01:45.138
(chuckling): I could never
afford a gag like this.

01:45.172 --> 01:46.740
That's amazing.

01:46.773 --> 01:49.309
We're so glad you're enjoying
the show, Jim. (laughs)

-NADJA: You think
that the celebrities

02:27.414 --> 02:29.283
would have caught on by now,
but I have got Chloë Sevigny

02:29.316 --> 02:31.051
and Tiki Barber booked
for tomorrow night,

02:31.084 --> 02:33.453
and the great Fran Lebowitz
on Thursday.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.556
She says what
we're all thinking.

02:35.589 --> 02:39.193
Okay, time for my little
moneymaker, Baby Colin.

02:39.226 --> 02:41.094
Let's get on with the show.

02:41.128 --> 02:42.229
Now, where is he?

02:42.262 --> 02:44.731
-(grunts)
-(whispers indistinctly)

02:44.765 --> 02:47.401
Are you fucking kidding me?

02:47.434 --> 02:49.703
What do you mean that
Baby Colin is not performing?

02:49.736 --> 02:51.772
He goes on every night
at 3:00 a. m.!

02:51.805 --> 02:54.341
I know, my darling,
but things have changed.

02:54.374 --> 02:56.577
The nightclub
is extraordinarily successful,

02:56.610 --> 03:00.180
and we both know why, so his
contract must reflect that.

03:00.214 --> 03:02.349
-He doesn't have a contract.
-Au contraire.

03:02.382 --> 03:04.585
-I drew one up this morning.
-(Nadja groans)

03:06.453 --> 03:09.423
GUILLERMO:
So, full disclosure,

03:09.456 --> 03:11.725
(whispers):
I met someone.

03:11.758 --> 03:14.294
Well, a while back, when
I was in England with Nadja,

03:14.328 --> 03:16.396
there was this guy, Freddie,

03:16.430 --> 03:19.099
and yeah, we just had
this whirlwind romance.

03:19.132 --> 03:21.101
Ever since I've been back here
we've been FaceTiming,

03:21.134 --> 03:22.736
like, all the time.
(laughs)

03:22.769 --> 03:25.305
And now, he's coming
to New York for the weekend.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.074
-FREDDIE: See you soon.
-(whispers): Okay, besos.

03:27.107 --> 03:29.576
Which is super exciting
and super terrifying,

03:29.610 --> 03:32.179
(chuckles):
because he's the first person

03:32.212 --> 03:36.216
that I've ever really
dated dated, you know?

03:36.250 --> 03:37.784
I'm gonna pick him up
at the airport,

03:37.818 --> 03:40.287
and we're gonna spend
the whole weekend in the city,

03:40.320 --> 03:42.623
-just Freddie and I and...
-(doorbell rings)

03:42.656 --> 03:45.459
Oh, sorry. Sorry, guys.
I'll be back.

03:47.027 --> 03:49.997
-Surprise. (laughs)
-Oh. Freddie.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.165
My flight got in early.

03:51.198 --> 03:53.066
Oh, my God, look at your face.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.669
-"Look at my face." Oh, wow.
-Aww.

03:55.702 --> 03:57.171
Who-who are these guys?

03:57.204 --> 03:58.305
It's a, uh, a documentary crew.

03:58.338 --> 03:59.640
How did you find my place?

03:59.673 --> 04:01.475
Oh, return address
of the post you sent me.

04:01.508 --> 04:04.244
Sorry, the "mail" you sent me.
Oh, my God, you Americans.

04:04.278 --> 04:06.113
-(laughs)
-NANDOR: Guillermo?

04:06.146 --> 04:08.315
Oh. That is very kind of you,

04:08.348 --> 04:10.317
but I'm not hungry right now.

04:13.053 --> 04:15.088
GUIDE:
(clears throat) Number one,

04:15.122 --> 04:18.091
"Nightclub staff will not
make direct eye contact

04:18.125 --> 04:19.593
with Colin unless they are
giving him a gift."

04:19.626 --> 04:21.528
-(Nadja groans)
-COLIN: Hey, Nadja, guess what?

04:21.562 --> 04:23.397
-NADJA: What?
-Chicken butt.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.099
-Ugh.
-Okay, number two, uh,

04:26.133 --> 04:27.768
"We also require a merch table,

04:27.801 --> 04:30.404
"where we will sell
Colin's new compact disc..."

04:30.437 --> 04:33.040
LASZLO:
Call Me Colin:
An Hour of Singsongs

04:33.073 --> 04:35.742
and Laugh-'Em-Ups
for the Whole Famn Damily.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.378
-Are you gonna sign it?
-Of course not!

04:38.412 --> 04:39.613
My darling,
if it wasn't for this boy,

04:39.646 --> 04:41.114
your club would be
as dead as disco.

04:41.148 --> 04:42.716
-COLIN: And guess what?
-BOTH: What?

04:42.749 --> 04:45.485
All I want is to sing and dance
and make people smile.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.788
I don't even really care about
all this contract baloney.

04:47.821 --> 04:50.190
No, no, no, no. He doesn't
know what he's saying.

04:50.224 --> 04:51.492
So, do have we a deal?

04:51.525 --> 04:54.428
Um, let me just have a little
think, uh, mull it over.

04:55.629 --> 04:58.232
-All right.
-What is this made of?

04:58.265 --> 05:00.601
Fuck no!
Do you think that my club

05:00.634 --> 05:03.670
needs this little weird
ventriloquist tap-dancing freak?

05:03.704 --> 05:06.173
-Hey.
-But he is our main attraction.

05:06.206 --> 05:08.242
I could replace him in a second.

05:08.275 --> 05:09.710
Well, good luck with that.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.211
I've had the owner
of the hottest vampire nightclub

05:11.245 --> 05:12.679
on the phone to me
day and night,

05:12.713 --> 05:14.147
and he's not the only one.

05:14.181 --> 05:15.749
So you're actually
going to leave?

05:15.782 --> 05:18.018
Looks that way, doesn't it?
Come on, boy.

05:18.051 --> 05:20.554
Let's take your talents upstate.

05:20.587 --> 05:22.589
Albany and Binghamton,
to be more precise, but...

05:22.623 --> 05:24.658
-got to start somewhere.
-(Nadja groans)

05:26.293 --> 05:28.428
FREDDIE:
Wow, this place
is like a museum.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.264
I-I can't believe this
is your house, Guillermo.

05:30.297 --> 05:32.032
Well, it's actually
not my house.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.400
I just help take care of Nandor.

05:33.433 --> 05:34.668
How'd you never mention that?

05:34.701 --> 05:36.537
I-I thought you worked
at the U. N.

05:36.570 --> 05:37.704
Don't be silly.

05:37.738 --> 05:40.507
Guillermo does not work
at the U and N.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.142
(whispering):
He forgets a lot of things.

05:42.176 --> 05:44.344
His mind doesn't work
the way it used to, so...

05:44.378 --> 05:48.015
-I volunteer on my days off.
-Aw, you're so sweet.

05:48.048 --> 05:49.650
-NANDOR: Guillermo.
-Hmm.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.519
Why did you not tell me you had
a friend coming to visit?

05:52.553 --> 05:54.188
-Friends...
-Oh, we're, uh,
we're a little bit

05:54.221 --> 05:55.556
more than friends, actually.

05:55.589 --> 05:58.158
Oh, I see.

05:58.192 --> 06:00.494
-Best friends.
-GUILLERMO: No, uh...

06:01.295 --> 06:03.664
He's my boyfriend.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.532
Oh.

06:05.566 --> 06:09.036
-Oh, wow.
-(Freddie chuckles)

06:09.069 --> 06:12.139
And I'm sorry I didn't
mention that earlier.

06:12.172 --> 06:13.106
This is fantastic news.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.241
-FREDDIE: Right?
-GUILLERMO: Good.

06:14.274 --> 06:16.043
And a long time coming.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.111
-Oh.
-He has been very lonely.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.546
-Oh.
-Extremely lonely.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.148
-GUILLERMO: Not that lonely.
-Pretty lonely.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.482
Not that lonely.

06:22.516 --> 06:24.051
NANDOR:
Very pathetic. Really lonely.

06:24.084 --> 06:27.120
Thank you, Nandor,
that is very interesting.

06:27.154 --> 06:29.790
And can I just reiterate
that your home is beautiful?

06:29.823 --> 06:32.593
I-I mean, this tapestry,
is this Turkish in origin?

06:32.626 --> 06:34.394
-Y-Yes. Yes...
-Around the 15th century,
this one here?

06:34.428 --> 06:35.729
GUILLERMO:
Freddie's actually
a junior associate

06:35.762 --> 06:37.164
at an auction house in London.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.032
He's kind of an art buff.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.134
-(laughs): No.
-Very good eye.

06:41.168 --> 06:44.538
I disemboweled many villagers
to get this tapestry.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.073
(whispers): We're thinking
of upping his medicine dose

06:46.106 --> 06:47.474
-'cause...
-(Freddie laughs)

06:47.508 --> 06:50.177
I would love to hear more
of your stories, Nandor.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.045
I'm just so glad
to have a new buddy.

06:52.079 --> 06:55.048
Oh, that's me.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.316
I am the buddy.

06:56.350 --> 06:58.452
This, uh, this place
is pretty dusty, though.

06:58.485 --> 07:00.487
I'd tell you to get a Roomba
in here, but, uh,

07:00.521 --> 07:02.422
-I think it might kill itself.
-(both laugh)

07:02.456 --> 07:05.259
-(laughs)
-I couldn't resist.

07:05.292 --> 07:08.228
I don't know what any of that
means, but I love it.

07:08.262 --> 07:10.364
Okay. Such long teeth.

07:10.397 --> 07:13.100
It's a genetic disorder
in the family.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.202
And, uh, if you ever need anyone
to help you look after

07:15.235 --> 07:17.004
any of these treasures,

07:17.037 --> 07:19.273
-promise you'll give me
a call, eh?
-Oh.

07:19.306 --> 07:21.575
So nice to meet you.
What a, what a pleasure.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.110
-I'll see you very soon.
-Yes.

07:23.143 --> 07:24.244
-All right.
-Hopefully.

07:24.278 --> 07:26.280
-Bye-bye.
-GUILLERMO: Sorry about that...

07:26.313 --> 07:28.148
-FREDDIE: That's okay.
-(door closes)

07:36.256 --> 07:37.691
NANDOR:
I cannot sleep.

07:37.724 --> 07:39.560
My mind has been seized
by thoughts

07:39.593 --> 07:42.362
of a very special person.

07:43.230 --> 07:45.365
A person by the name of...

07:45.399 --> 07:46.433
Freddie.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.302
Ever since he and Guillermo

07:48.335 --> 07:51.405
left for the hotel,
Freddie's charm

07:51.438 --> 07:55.509
and sweet, supportive nature
have echoed in my mind.

07:55.542 --> 07:57.444
He touched my arm.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.147
Also, things have grown
a little stale

08:00.180 --> 08:02.015
with my beloved Marwa.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.151
Are you, um...

08:04.184 --> 08:07.421
enjoying sitting in that chair?

08:07.454 --> 08:10.491
Yes. Hmm.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.027
And yours is good?

08:14.061 --> 08:16.497
Yes, uh...

08:16.530 --> 08:20.367
It was a little bit hard,
so I put a cushion on it.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.536
-Wonderful.
-Yes.

08:22.569 --> 08:25.072
NANDOR (sighs):
Fuck, she's boring.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.207
But marriage is sacred to me.

08:27.241 --> 08:30.177
I never once cheated
on any of my 37 wives,

08:30.210 --> 08:32.246
and I'm not about to start now.

08:32.279 --> 08:35.582
Could I steal Freddie
from Guillermo?

08:35.616 --> 08:36.750
Of course.

08:36.783 --> 08:38.218
But that would be cruel.

08:38.252 --> 08:41.755

sloppy seconds.

If only...

08:43.123 --> 08:45.092
Excuse me for a moment.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.228
(quietly): I'm not sure
if this is possible,

08:48.262 --> 08:50.497
but I wish for Marwa
to be transformed

08:50.531 --> 08:55.068
into an exact copy
of this person: Freddie.

08:55.102 --> 08:57.671
Appearance, personality,
everything.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.773
-Why are you whispering?
-Because Marwa is someone

08:59.806 --> 09:01.608
that I love very much,

09:01.642 --> 09:03.143
and I don't want her to hear
that I'm about to change her

09:03.177 --> 09:05.345
into a completely
different person.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.182
As you wish.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.720
Marwa?

09:15.189 --> 09:17.291
(door creaks)

09:17.324 --> 09:18.992
Hello.

09:19.026 --> 09:21.361
Hi, there. I'm Freddie.

09:21.395 --> 09:23.096
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.331
Boy, this place is pretty dusty.

09:24.364 --> 09:25.666
I'd tell you to get
a Roomba in here,

09:25.699 --> 09:27.367

it might kill itself.

Our star performer's departure

09:37.177 --> 09:39.646
could not come at a worse time
for Mistress Nadja.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.182
I'm actually a little worried
about her.

09:42.216 --> 09:44.218
There's so much pressure
running a nightclub,

09:44.251 --> 09:47.054
and she's been consuming
a massive amount

09:47.087 --> 09:48.288
of liquor blood.

09:48.322 --> 09:49.723
Are you talking shit about me?

09:49.756 --> 09:51.992
-No.
-Hey, I love you
like a sister, baby,

09:52.025 --> 09:54.528
you know it, but even--
if you even think

09:54.561 --> 09:57.998
about damaging my brand,
I will cut you in two!

09:58.031 --> 09:59.333
