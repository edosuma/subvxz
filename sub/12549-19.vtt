WEBVTT

00:06.837 --> 00:08.799
- PREVIOUSLY ON "TWISTED"...
- Kyle: THERE'S BEEN
A CAR ACCIDENT.

00:08.799 --> 00:11.182
- IT'S VIKRAM.
- SOMEBODY MUST'VE
MOVED THE BODY.

00:11.182 --> 00:13.094
- JACK.
- WHY WOULD
HE DO THAT FOR ME?

00:13.094 --> 00:14.635
HE WOULD DO IT FOR ME.

00:14.635 --> 00:16.557
WHEN YOU QUIT WORKING
FOR VIKRAM, YOU ATTACKED--

00:16.557 --> 00:18.399
HOW COULD YOU
THINK I'M CAPABLE
OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

00:18.399 --> 00:20.271
WELL, YOU'RE CAPABLE
OF MOVING HIS BODY!

00:20.271 --> 00:22.943
WHEN I CAME TO GREEN GROVE,
I WAS COMING FROM JUVIE.

00:22.943 --> 00:25.446
- DID YOU KNOW DANNY?
- I MAY KNOW HIM BETTER
THAN YOU DO.

00:25.446 --> 00:27.988
I DID NOT PLAN
TO KILL MY FATHER.

00:27.988 --> 00:29.820
YOU KILLED YOUR DAD?

00:29.820 --> 00:31.992
I HAD ANOTHER BABY.
I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW.

00:31.992 --> 00:34.365
I DID KNOW.
VIKRAM TOLD ME.

00:34.365 --> 00:36.287
I KNOW WHERE HE KEPT
THE ADOPTION PAPERS.

00:36.287 --> 00:38.959
- DO YOU WANT
TO FIND YOUR CHILD?
- OF COURSE I DO.

00:38.959 --> 00:40.661
- GUYS, THEY...
- SUCK?

00:40.661 --> 00:41.792
AND LIE!

00:43.294 --> 00:45.086
- SOMETHING WRONG?
- YOU COULD SAY THAT.

00:45.086 --> 00:47.468
- WHY DID YOU ARREST HIM?
- LACEY, CAN YOU TAKE HER HOME?

00:47.468 --> 00:49.510
I'M LEAVING UNTIL
YOU TELL ME WHAT HE DID.

00:49.510 --> 00:50.801
AND I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING WITH JO.

00:50.801 --> 00:53.724
LEAVE ME AND JO
THE HELL ALONE.

00:53.724 --> 00:57.978
I CAME TO GREEN GROVE
BECAUSE DANNY MADE IT
SOUND GREAT.

01:05.025 --> 01:06.817
( chattering )

01:08.399 --> 01:10.901
THEY FOUND MY DAD'S D.N.A.
IN DANNY'S DAD'S CAR.

01:10.901 --> 01:12.403
THEY THINK THAT
MY DAD KILLED HIM.

01:12.403 --> 01:14.995
LOOK, I'M SURE IT'S JUST
A BIG MISUNDERSTANDING.

01:14.995 --> 01:16.907
I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, IT'S D.N.A.

01:16.907 --> 01:20.000
- SURE, BUT--
- AND I KNOW MY DAD
REALLY LOVES KAREN.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.964
HE ALWAYS HAS.
THEIR AFFAIR IS WHAT BROKE UP
MY PARENTS' MARRIAGE.

01:23.964 --> 01:25.756
- OH, I DIDN'T-- I DIDN'T--
- SO I DON'T KNOW,

01:25.756 --> 01:28.549
MAYBE HE THOUGHT...
THAT WAS HIS CHANCE

01:28.549 --> 01:30.921
- TO FINALLY--
- WHITNEY, YOUR DAD
IS NOT A KILLER.

01:30.921 --> 01:33.514
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM.
YOU JUST MET HIM.

01:33.514 --> 01:35.926
OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT, I--
I MAY NOT KNOW YOUR DAD,

01:35.926 --> 01:38.479
BUT I DO KNOW FOR SURE
THAT HE DID NOT KILL VIKRAM.

01:38.479 --> 01:39.770
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

01:39.770 --> 01:42.483
I JUST DO, OKAY?

01:42.483 --> 01:43.934
DO YOU KNOW
VIKRAM DESAI?

01:43.934 --> 01:45.686
YES.

01:45.686 --> 01:47.608
HAVE YOU BEEN SLEEPING
WITH HIS WIFE?

01:47.608 --> 01:50.491
- YES.
- WHOA WHOA WHOA.
HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

01:50.491 --> 01:52.233
I'M SORRY, MR. TAYLOR,
BUT I HAVE TO REMIND YOU

01:52.233 --> 01:54.195
THAT YOU'RE ANSWERING
THESE QUESTIONS AGAINST
THE LEGAL COUNSEL--

01:54.195 --> 01:55.996
I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE.

01:55.996 --> 01:57.908
I'LL ANSWER
ANYTHING HE WANTS.

01:57.908 --> 02:00.080
GOOD.
HOW ABOUT THIS?

02:00.080 --> 02:03.003
DID YOU TAMPER
WITH VIKRAM'S CAR?

02:03.003 --> 02:05.956
WHAT? NO.

02:05.956 --> 02:08.048
DID YOU KILL HIM?
MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
AN ACCIDENT?

02:08.048 --> 02:10.211
THAT'S ABSURD.
NEXT QUESTION.

02:10.211 --> 02:12.132
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
INSIDE VIKRAM'S CAR?

02:12.132 --> 02:14.094
I WORKED FOR HIM...
YEARS AGO.

02:14.094 --> 02:15.966
BUT THE CAR
THAT HE WAS DRIVING
WHEN HE DIED?

02:15.966 --> 02:17.348
NO, NEVER.

02:17.348 --> 02:19.350
THEN WHY IS
YOUR D.N.A. ALL OVER IT?

02:21.812 --> 02:24.185
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. IT--
- IT'S NOT ONLY POSSIBLE,

02:24.185 --> 02:26.026
IT'S TRUE.

02:26.977 --> 02:28.979
- SO YOU THINK--
- I THINK YOU KILLED HIM,

02:28.979 --> 02:30.611
MURDERED HIM
FOR THE MONEY...

02:31.862 --> 02:33.654
AND A CHANCE
TO BE WITH HIS WIFE.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.326
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

02:36.487 --> 02:38.489
I THINK I'M GONNA
STOP TALKING NOW.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.876
( sighs )
WHITNEY, MY GOD.

02:47.338 --> 02:49.840
LISTEN, WHAT THEY'RE
SAYING ABOUT YOUR FATHER,
IT'S NOT TRUE.

02:49.840 --> 02:52.963
- IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
I KEEP HEARING.

02:52.963 --> 02:56.387
UH, I WANT TO SEE JACK.

02:56.387 --> 02:58.349
SORRY, THE CHIEF'S
IN WITH HIM NOW.

02:58.349 --> 03:01.262
AND WHEN HE'S DONE,
HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.

03:01.262 --> 03:05.065
( sighs )
DANNY, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
LACEY AND WHITNEY HOME, OKAY?

03:05.065 --> 03:07.228
Whitney: I DON'T THINK I--
Karen: YOU'RE STAYING WITH US.

03:07.228 --> 03:10.311
- I'LL MAKE SURE IT'S OKAY.
- NO, I MEAN I'M NOT
LEAVING MY DAD.

03:11.902 --> 03:13.484
HONEY, I'VE BEEN
THROUGH THIS.

03:13.484 --> 03:15.446
THEY'RE NOT GONNA
LET YOU SEE HIM
ANYTIME SOON.

03:15.446 --> 03:18.489
Danny: IT'S TRUE.
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW

03:18.489 --> 03:20.911
EXCEPT FOR TRY
TO GET SOME REST.

03:20.911 --> 03:22.323
YEAH, LIKE THAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN.

03:22.323 --> 03:25.286
YOU KNOW,
WHITNEY, DANNY'S RIGHT.
WE SHOULD PROBABLY GO.

03:25.286 --> 03:27.998
( sighs )
OKAY, WHATEVER.

03:29.830 --> 03:32.923
I'M TELLING YOU,
WE'RE GONNA FIGURE
THIS OUT, OKAY?

03:38.599 --> 03:40.261
YEAH, WE'D BETTER.

03:44.845 --> 03:46.847
( theme music playing )

03:55.856 --> 03:57.528
THANK YOU
FOR LETTING ME
STAY WITH YOU.

03:57.528 --> 03:59.820
UH, OF COURSE,
NO WORRIES.

03:59.820 --> 04:03.324
I JUST GOTTA TAKE
A SHOWER. MAYBE I CAN
BORROW SOME SWEATS?

04:03.324 --> 04:05.165
- SURE, YEAH,
IT'S ALL UPSTAIRS.
- THANK YOU.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.960
OH, HEY, WHITNEY,
I THINK I'M GONNA TAKE OFF

04:09.960 --> 04:11.712
- IF YOU'RE OKAY.
- OH, YEAH.

04:11.712 --> 04:13.924
I'M JUST MY MOM'S
PROBABLY WORRIED.
IT'S SO LATE.

04:13.924 --> 04:16.797
- OF COURSE, I'M SORRY.
- NO, PLEASE. "SORRY"?

04:16.797 --> 04:20.050
LACEY, YOU'RE BEEN...
AMAZING.

04:20.050 --> 04:21.762
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

04:26.687 --> 04:27.938
I'LL CALL YOU
IN THE MORNING, OKAY?

04:27.938 --> 04:29.350
GREAT.

04:34.855 --> 04:36.156
COME HERE.

04:38.739 --> 04:41.742
LOOK, I DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING, BECAUSE--

04:41.742 --> 04:43.824
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE.
- LACEY, NO, LOOK--

04:43.824 --> 04:47.287
YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING.
YOU CAN'T LET WHITNEY'S DAD
TAKE THE BLAME FOR THIS.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.910
I KNOW, OKAY?
NO ONE UNDERSTANDS THAT
BETTER THAN I DO.

04:49.910 --> 04:52.413
I GOT MY MOM TO CALL
THE BEST LAWYER IN NEW YORK.

04:52.413 --> 04:53.794
SHE'S ON HER WAY NOW...

04:53.794 --> 04:56.717
( sighs )
SO JUST DON'T WORRY.

05:03.474 --> 05:07.728
( breathes deeply )

05:16.487 --> 05:18.859
IT'S LATE.
I SHOULD GET OUT OF HERE.

05:18.859 --> 05:21.532
OH MY GOD,
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I FELL ASLEEP.

05:21.532 --> 05:23.824
- ( both laugh )
- THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.866
NO, IT'S SO NOT.

05:25.866 --> 05:27.998
I'M GLAD YOU FELT
COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO SLEEP.

05:27.998 --> 05:30.951
- CLEARLY SO DID I.
- ( lock clicks )

05:30.951 --> 05:32.583
( both gasp )

05:33.714 --> 05:35.956
- MOM.
- HEY, MS. MASTERSON.

05:35.956 --> 05:37.798
- NOTHING HAPPENED.
WE WERE JUST--
- ( door closes )

05:37.798 --> 05:39.259
WHERE'S YOUR FATHER?
ISN'T HE HOME YET?

05:39.259 --> 05:42.633
WE WOULDN'T BE--
WELL, BECAUSE OF--

05:44.014 --> 05:46.136
- I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.
- I SPOKE TO HIM HOURS AGO.

05:46.136 --> 05:48.308
I THOUGHT HE'D BE HOME BY NOW.
IT'S BEEN A CRAZY NIGHT.

05:48.308 --> 05:51.682
- WHY? WHAT HAPPENED?
- JACK TAYLOR WAS ARRESTED
FOR KILLING VIKRAM,

05:51.682 --> 05:53.854
SO I NEED
TO GO CALL YOUR DAD.

05:55.025 --> 05:56.977
JACK-- JACK TAYLOR?
ISN'T THAT--

05:56.977 --> 05:59.109
YEAH, YOU SHOULD GO.

05:59.109 --> 06:01.191
NO, I CAN STAY.
LET ME HELP YOU.

06:01.191 --> 06:04.034
PLEASE, I JUST--
I JUST NEED TO TALK TO DANNY.

06:07.948 --> 06:09.119
ALL RIGHT.

06:14.915 --> 06:17.297
( door opens, closes )

06:20.090 --> 06:22.382
IS JACK ALL RIGHT?
DID HE ADMIT TO ANYTHING?

06:22.382 --> 06:24.134
YOU KNOW I CAN'T TALK
ABOUT THAT WITH YOU.

06:24.134 --> 06:25.676
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
I'M GONNA GO HOME
AND THEN--

06:25.676 --> 06:26.927
ACTUALLY, I HAVE
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS

06:26.927 --> 06:28.559
TO ASK YOU
IF YOU DON'T MIND. PLEASE.

06:28.559 --> 06:30.721
- ( sighs ) KYLE.
- HAVE A SEAT.

06:33.183 --> 06:34.645
- ( clears throat )
- ( door closes )

06:36.477 --> 06:38.148
( sighs )

06:38.148 --> 06:39.279
( exhales sharply )

06:39.279 --> 06:41.612
I KNOW YOU TWO WERE
HAVING AN AFFAIR.

06:41.612 --> 06:44.945
TECHNICALLY,
IT'S NOT AN AFFAIR.
MY HUSBAND'S DEAD.

06:44.945 --> 06:47.287
BUT IT STARTED
BEFORE HE DIED, RIGHT?

06:47.287 --> 06:50.030
( scoffs )
JACK AND I WERE
TOGETHER YEARS AGO,

06:50.030 --> 06:51.912
- BUT IT ENDED.
- WHY?

06:51.912 --> 06:54.535
'CAUSE HE REALIZED YOU WERE
NEVER GONNA LEAVE VIKRAM?

06:54.535 --> 06:55.796
ARE YOU INTERROGATING ME?

06:55.796 --> 06:57.958
JUST ASKING
SOME QUESTIONS.

06:57.958 --> 06:59.249
IF YOU NEED
TO CALL A LAWYER--

06:59.249 --> 07:01.381
( laughs )
NO, I'M FINE.

07:01.381 --> 07:05.255
DID YOU EVER TELL JACK ABOUT
THAT LIFE INSURANCE POLICY?

07:05.255 --> 07:06.677
$10 MILLION?

07:07.808 --> 07:11.011
YES, BUT NOT UNTIL THE NIGHT
THEY FOUND VIKRAM'S BODY.

07:11.011 --> 07:12.973
AND JACK WAS WITH ME
THE WHOLE NIGHT, SO--

07:12.973 --> 07:15.185
THE TIME OF DEATH WAS
ABOUT 48 HOURS EARLIER.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.437
THE CAR HAD BEEN
IN THAT GULLY FOR A WHILE.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.859
IT'S A PRETTY REMOTE SPOT.

07:18.859 --> 07:20.150
BUT JACK DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT THE MONEY THEN.

07:20.150 --> 07:22.192
HE USED TO WORK
FOR VIKRAM, RIGHT?

07:22.192 --> 07:25.405
MAYBE VIKRAM TOLD HIM
ABOUT THE POLICY

07:25.405 --> 07:27.367
OR HE FOUND OUT
SOME OTHER WAY,
DON'T YOU THINK?

07:30.370 --> 07:32.663
I GUESS IT'S...
POSSIBLE.

07:35.536 --> 07:37.918
DO YOU THINK
JACK IS CAPABLE OF MURDER?

07:41.962 --> 07:43.964
KAREN, DO YOU HAVE
ANY REASON TO BELIEVE

07:43.964 --> 07:46.086
THAT JACK WANTED
VIKRAM DEAD?

07:46.086 --> 07:49.510
I DIDN'T THINK SO, BUT--

07:49.510 --> 07:50.681
I DON'T KNOW.

07:51.802 --> 07:53.183
I JUST DON'T KNOW.

08:00.100 --> 08:02.523
HOW GOOD IS THIS LAWYER?
'CAUSE I'M NOT LETTING

08:02.523 --> 08:04.815
AN INNOCENT MAN GO TO JAIL
FOR SOMETHING THAT I DID.

08:04.815 --> 08:06.987
WELL, HE'S NOT
EXACTLY INNOCENT.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.949
HE'S THE ONE
WHO STAGED THE ACCIDENT.

08:08.949 --> 08:11.992
AS A FAVOR TO ME, TO US.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.534
WELL, MAYBE.

08:13.534 --> 08:16.036
MAYBE JACK KNEW ABOUT
THE LIFE INSURANCE POLICY

08:16.036 --> 08:18.619
- BEFORE I EVEN MENTIONED IT.
- ( fridge door opens, closes )

08:18.619 --> 08:20.831
MAYBE HE WANTED THEM
TO FIND YOUR DAD'S BODY

08:20.831 --> 08:22.923
SO THAT WE COULD
CLAIM THE MONEY.

08:22.923 --> 08:24.925
WAIT, WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

08:24.925 --> 08:27.047
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAID
HE WAS THIS NICE GUY--
- I KNOW.

08:28.839 --> 08:31.802
VIKRAM TOLD TESS
THAT HIS LIFE WAS IN DANGER,

08:31.802 --> 08:34.094
AND HE DISAPPEARED
AFTER JACK WENT TO SEE HIM.

08:34.094 --> 08:37.598
- THEY HAD A BIG FIGHT, SO--
- SO WHAT, YOU THINK JACK
TRIED TO KILL HIM

08:37.598 --> 08:38.849
SIX MONTHS AGO?

08:38.849 --> 08:40.851
I MEAN, WHAT DOES
THAT MATTER NOW?

08:40.851 --> 08:44.695
I'M JUST SAYING
MAYBE JACK ISN'T SUCH
A SAINT AFTER ALL.

08:44.695 --> 08:47.107
WHATEVER HE DID,
WHATEVER HIS MOTIVES,

08:47.107 --> 08:49.650
I'M THE ONE
WHO KILLED MY DAD.

08:49.650 --> 08:52.492
- ( sighs )
- AND RIGHT NOW,
THAT IS ALL THAT MATTERS.

08:52.492 --> 08:54.034
( knocks on door )

08:59.119 --> 09:01.872
- ( door opens )
- Karen: OH MY GOD,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

09:01.872 --> 09:03.253
- ( door closes )
- Jo: I NEED TO TALK TO DANNY.

09:03.253 --> 09:05.926
- FINE, BUT--
- IT'S OKAY.

09:05.926 --> 09:07.928
- I GOT IT. THANKS.
- ( sighs )

09:11.842 --> 09:15.385
- COME ON.
- DANNY. DANNY.

09:16.887 --> 09:19.850
LOOK, EITHER JACK'S
ABOUT TO TELL MY DAD
EVERYTHING OR--

09:19.850 --> 09:22.232
NO, IF HE WAS
GONNA SAY ANYTHING,
HE WOULD'VE DONE IT BY NOW.

09:22.232 --> 09:23.774
SO HE'S JUST GONNA
COVER FOR YOU?

09:23.774 --> 09:25.816
HE'S GONNA GO TO PRISON
FOR A MURDER HE DIDN'T COMMIT?

09:25.816 --> 09:27.237
YOU CAN'T LET HIM
DO THAT, DANNY.

09:27.237 --> 09:29.109
- WE CAN'T LET HIM DO THAT.
- I KNOW THAT.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.452
I'M HANDLING IT.
RIGHT NOW,

09:32.452 --> 09:33.954
I'M MORE WORRIED
ABOUT CHARLIE.

09:33.954 --> 09:35.906
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

09:37.618 --> 09:39.910
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU SAID
YOU WANTED SOME SPACE, JO,

09:39.910 --> 09:42.793
- SO TAKE SOME SPACE.
- DANNY, SERIOUSLY,

09:42.793 --> 09:45.966
- JUST TELL ME WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA DO.
- NO. I'M ON IT.

09:45.966 --> 09:47.547
GOOD NIGHT.

09:55.305 --> 09:57.307
( door opens, closes )

09:57.307 --> 09:59.099
( clicks )

10:46.817 --> 10:49.029
OKAY. YES. YES.

10:49.029 --> 10:51.531
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

10:51.531 --> 10:54.034
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

10:54.034 --> 10:56.446
- WHO WAS THAT?
- MY DAUGHTER'S MOTHER.

10:56.446 --> 10:59.870
- I MEAN, HER ADOPTIVE--
- YOU'RE KIDDING.

10:59.870 --> 11:02.282
( sighs )
I SAW HER LAST NIGHT.

11:02.282 --> 11:04.284
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

11:04.284 --> 11:07.087
YOU WERE RIGHT. IT--
IT WAS TOO LATE TO KNOCK,

11:07.087 --> 11:09.209
SO I-- I JUST LEFT A NOTE...

11:09.209 --> 11:11.091
FOR THE MOTHER.

11:11.091 --> 11:13.213
AND NOW SHE WANTS
TO MEET,

11:13.213 --> 11:15.385
EVEN SAID SHE'D COME
TO GREEN GROVE.

11:15.385 --> 11:17.758
- TODAY?
- YEAH.

11:17.758 --> 11:20.430
SHE'S NOT GONNA
BRING HER DAUGHTER--
NOT YET, ANYWAY.

11:20.430 --> 11:24.304
BUT... I THINK IT'S
A REALLY GREAT FIRST STEP.

11:24.304 --> 11:27.147
SORRY I CAN'T BE THERE.
I'VE GOT A HUGE DAY.

11:27.147 --> 11:28.899
YEAH, OF-- OF COURSE.

11:29.900 --> 11:31.021
TESS.

11:32.022 --> 11:34.865
THIS IS...
( sighs )

11:34.865 --> 11:38.078
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU,
BUT I STILL JUST...

11:39.990 --> 11:43.243
( sighs )
I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN.

11:43.243 --> 11:44.785
I KNOW, I KNOW.

11:46.086 --> 11:47.788
I APPRECIATE IT.

11:49.169 --> 11:50.540
I'LL BE FINE.

11:52.172 --> 11:55.675
( sighs )
BUT I THINK
IT'S TIME TO TELL JO.

12:00.680 --> 12:02.682
COME ON!

12:02.682 --> 12:05.605
WHAT IS
THIS BIG CONSPIRACY

12:05.605 --> 12:07.187
THAT MY DAD'S CAUGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF?

12:07.187 --> 12:09.269
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

12:09.269 --> 12:10.851
PLEASE,
IT'S ALL THREE OF YOU--

12:10.851 --> 12:13.403
YOU, DANNY, KAREN.

12:13.403 --> 12:16.316
- IF MY DAD REALLY IS INNOCENT--
- LOOK, WHITNEY,

12:16.316 --> 12:19.699
- DANNY HIRED A GREAT LAWYER.
- AND WHAT IF THAT DOESN'T WORK?

12:19.699 --> 12:22.863
I'VE ONLY JUST NOW
GOTTEN THIS CHANCE TO SPEND
TIME WITH MY DAD AGAIN,

12:22.863 --> 12:24.204
AND HE'S ALREADY
SLIPPING AWAY.

12:24.204 --> 12:27.077
NO, THAT WON'T HAPPEN.
DANNY WON'T LET IT.

12:27.077 --> 12:29.539
RIGHT. DANNY.

12:30.580 --> 12:33.293
( scoffs )
I THOUGHT YOU AND I

12:33.293 --> 12:34.754
HAD MADE A CONNECTION.

12:34.754 --> 12:38.508
WE DID, AND IT MEANS
A LOT TO ME.

12:39.930 --> 12:42.512
- I JUST-- IT'S--
- ( knocks rapidly )

12:42.512 --> 12:44.514
Kyle:
POLICE! OPEN THE DOOR,
WE HAVE A WARRANT!

12:44.514 --> 12:47.147
WHAT NOW?
( sighs )

12:49.689 --> 12:51.351
- I JUST CAME
TO GET SOME OF MY STUFF.
- DROP WHAT YOU'RE TAKING.

12:51.351 --> 12:54.194
- IT'S EVIDENCE.
- YOU GIRLS NEED
TO LEAVE RIGHT NOW.

12:54.194 --> 12:58.068
Man: DON'T FORGET
TO CHECK FOR FINGERPRINTS
ON ANY SURFACE.

13:02.112 --> 13:03.573
Man #2:
YO, COME OVER HERE.

13:04.704 --> 13:06.246
SO I HAVE A SISTER?

13:06.246 --> 13:08.288
I MEAN HALF, BUT--

13:08.288 --> 13:10.831
YEAH. YOU DO.

13:10.831 --> 13:14.124
I KNOW.
IT'S A LOT TO TAKE IN.

13:14.124 --> 13:15.505
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
ANY OF THIS BEFORE?

13:15.505 --> 13:17.217
I WANTED TO, BUT, UH...

13:18.298 --> 13:20.760
I KEPT IT
FROM YOUR DAD
FOR SO LONG...

13:24.344 --> 13:26.096
I WAS AFRAID
I WOULD LOSE HIM.

13:26.096 --> 13:30.770
AND THEN ONE LIE
LED TO ANOTHER AND...

13:32.102 --> 13:34.644
SUDDENLY IT FELT IMPOSSIBLE
TO EVER COME CLEAN.

13:34.644 --> 13:36.276
YEAH.

13:40.070 --> 13:43.823
WELL, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH
THIS ALONE, SO...

13:45.075 --> 13:46.826
IF IT'S OKAY,

13:46.826 --> 13:49.159
I WOULD REALLY LIKE
TO BE HERE...

13:49.159 --> 13:51.121
TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HER.

13:51.121 --> 13:52.913
OF COURSE IT'S OKAY.

13:52.913 --> 13:55.455
( chuckles )

13:55.455 --> 13:57.417
AND, HONEY, IF...

13:58.668 --> 14:00.921
IF YOU EVER
WANNA TALK ABOUT--

14:00.921 --> 14:03.593
- WHAT?
- I DON'T KNOW--

14:03.593 --> 14:07.057
CHARLIE, YOU,
THE COUCH.

14:07.057 --> 14:08.889
NOTHING HAPPENED.

14:08.889 --> 14:12.142
HONESTLY, THAT'S THE FURTHEST
THING FROM MY MIND RIGHT NOW.

14:13.143 --> 14:15.145
( people chattering )

14:17.978 --> 14:19.689
I COULDN'T GET
ANY OF MY STUFF,

14:19.689 --> 14:21.651
BECAUSE THE COPS CAME
AND THEY RAIDED
THE BOATHOUSE.

14:21.651 --> 14:23.863
HONEY, I KNOW.
LET'S JUST GET THROUGH
THIS HEARING

14:23.863 --> 14:26.156
AND THEN YOU CAN
GO HOME WITH YOUR FATHER
AND GET WHATEVER YOU NEED.

14:26.156 --> 14:28.828
WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE SO CONFIDENT.

14:28.828 --> 14:30.120
WHY ARE YOU?

14:31.291 --> 14:33.163
THE TRUTH IS, I'M NOT.

14:33.163 --> 14:35.705
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOUR FATHER'S CAPABLE OF.

14:35.705 --> 14:37.757
BUT WE BOTH KNOW
HE CAN BE VERY...

14:38.999 --> 14:41.301
PROTECTIVE
OF THE PEOPLE HE LOVES.

14:41.301 --> 14:43.133
SO WHO IS
HE PROTECTING NOW?

14:43.133 --> 14:45.135
YOU? DANNY?

14:45.135 --> 14:46.716
LOOK, DON'T WORRY, OKAY?

14:46.716 --> 14:48.718
- JUST GOTTA KEEP FAITH AND--
- Woman: OKAY, GUYS,

14:48.718 --> 14:52.272
WE'RE IN GOOD SHAPE.
YES, THERE'S D.N.A,
BUT THAT ONLY PROVES

14:52.272 --> 14:55.065
THAT JACK WAS
IN VIKRAM'S CAR
AT SOME POINT.

14:55.065 --> 14:56.476
AND YES,
JACK'S DENIED THAT,

14:56.476 --> 14:58.108
BUT I CAN FIND
A WORKAROUND.

14:58.108 --> 15:00.730
THERE'S NOTHING
OTHER THAN THE CHIEF'S
COCKAMAMIE THEORY

15:00.730 --> 15:03.153
ABOUT AN UNROLLED WINDOW
THAT INDICATES FOUL PLAY.

15:03.153 --> 15:05.235
- SO THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?
- YES.

15:05.235 --> 15:07.327
YEAH, THAT'S VERY GOOD.

15:08.658 --> 15:10.790
HEY, KAREN,
WOULD YOU MIND

15:10.790 --> 15:12.792
LOOKING AFTER WHITNEY
A LITTLE BIT LONGER?

15:12.792 --> 15:14.374
I CAN CALL CHILD
PROTECTIVE SERVICES, BUT--

15:14.374 --> 15:17.247
NO, I'M FINE.
JACK'S GONNA BE
OUT ON BAIL, SO--

15:17.247 --> 15:18.748
MAYBE NOT.

15:21.801 --> 15:23.213
( scoffs )
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

15:23.213 --> 15:25.175
AND... WHAT IS THAT?

15:25.175 --> 15:28.468
LOOK, YOU CAN
TELL US NOW OR IN 30 SECONDS
IN FRONT OF THE JUDGE,

15:28.468 --> 15:30.810
BUT YOU NEED
TO DISCLOSE THAT EVIDENCE.

15:30.810 --> 15:33.433
WE FOUND VIKRAM'S CELLPHONE
IN THE BOATHOUSE.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.225
IT'S CRACKED AND COVERED
IN DRIED BLOOD.

15:35.225 --> 15:36.856
MUST'VE HAD IT
ON HIM WHEN HE DIED.

15:36.856 --> 15:38.608
HOW DID THAT
GET IN THE BOATHOUSE?

15:38.608 --> 15:40.560
THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING
YOUR FATHER CAN TELL ME.

15:40.560 --> 15:41.982
EXCUSE ME.

15:43.153 --> 15:44.774
LET'S GO INSIDE.
WE'LL SORT IT OUT.

15:50.620 --> 15:52.702
( whispers )
HOW COULD JACK BE SO STUPID

15:52.702 --> 15:54.244
TO KEEP VIKRAM'S CELLPHONE?

15:54.244 --> 15:55.835
THAT'S JUST IT--
HE'S NOT.

15:55.835 --> 15:59.289
- WELL, CLEARLY HE IS.
- NO. NO.

15:59.289 --> 16:01.291
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS
DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT.

16:01.291 --> 16:03.253
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

16:03.253 --> 16:06.346
I THINK SOMEBODY PLANTED IT
THERE TO FRAME HIM.

16:06.346 --> 16:07.927
WHO WOULD DO THAT?

16:09.589 --> 16:11.091
I HAVE
A PRETTY GOOD IDEA.

16:13.093 --> 16:15.265
I'M SO SORRY.

16:15.265 --> 16:18.228
IF YOU SAW US LAST NIGHT,
THEN I UNDERSTAND
THE CONFUSION,

16:18.228 --> 16:20.310
BUT THAT ISN'T YOUR DAUGHTER.

16:20.310 --> 16:22.982
( scoffs )
BUT I HAVE YOUR NAME,

16:22.982 --> 16:26.066
- YOUR ADDRESS.
- YES, WE ADOPTED A BABY,

16:26.066 --> 16:27.407
YOUR BABY.

16:29.159 --> 16:30.610
WE NAMED HER SAMANTHA.

16:32.372 --> 16:34.204
BUT...

16:34.204 --> 16:36.456
SHE DIED WHEN SHE WAS
ONLY TWO YEARS OLD.

16:37.457 --> 16:38.998
WHAT?

16:40.500 --> 16:43.043
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT
AT THE PLAYGROUND.

16:45.425 --> 16:48.798
SHE FELL OFF THE SLIDE
AND HIT HER HEAD.

16:48.798 --> 16:51.341
- ( crying )
- I WANTED TO REACH OUT
TO YOU THEN,

16:51.341 --> 16:53.343
BUT IT WAS
A CLOSED ADOPTION,

16:53.343 --> 16:55.975
SO I HAD NO WAY
OF FINDING OUT
WHO YOU WERE.

16:56.976 --> 16:57.977
MOM.

17:01.271 --> 17:03.563
SO, SHE'S JUST...

17:04.564 --> 17:05.985
GONE?

17:07.737 --> 17:09.649
I BROUGHT YOU
SOME PHOTOS.

17:11.071 --> 17:13.453
I WANTED YOU TO SEE
HOW HAPPY SAM WAS,

17:13.453 --> 17:16.326
JUST AN ABSOLUTE JOY...

17:18.158 --> 17:21.161
A REAL...
GIFT TO OUR LIVES.

17:29.339 --> 17:31.721
Woman:
IN THE WAKE OF NEW,
INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE,

17:31.721 --> 17:34.013
JACK TAYLOR HAS
BEEN DENIED BAIL.

17:34.013 --> 17:36.766
HE'S EXPECTED TO BE ARRAIGNED
ON A MURDER ONE CHARGE

17:36.766 --> 17:39.179
FOR THE DEATH
OF VIKRAM DESAI.

17:39.179 --> 17:41.271
- ( cameras clicking )
- Man: MR. TAYLOR

17:41.271 --> 17:42.682
- DAD.
- WHITNEY.

17:42.682 --> 17:44.184
- DAD.
- WHITNEY, COME HERE.

17:44.184 --> 17:45.355
COME ON, GUYS,
THIS IS MY DAUGHTER.

17:45.355 --> 17:47.147
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- I'M FINE.

17:47.147 --> 17:50.150
- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
- NOTHING, NOTHING.

17:50.150 --> 17:51.951
- WHERE ARE YOU STAYING?
- AT THE DESAIS'.

17:51.951 --> 17:55.285
- FIND ANOTHER PLACE TO STAY.
- WHY? I MEAN, WHAT DO
I TELL THEM?

17:55.285 --> 17:57.247
TELL THEM
THEY BROKE MY HEART.

17:57.247 --> 17:59.539
- IT'S THAT BAD?
- JUST TELL THEM.

17:59.539 --> 18:01.541
( reporters shouting )

18:07.377 --> 18:10.130
THIS IS SO MESSED UP.
I JUST WANT TO TELL
WENDY THE TRUTH,

18:10.130 --> 18:12.132
THAT WHATEVER HER FATHER DID,
IT WASN'T MURDER.

18:13.263 --> 18:14.634
YEAH, I--

18:14.634 --> 18:16.846
I THINK IT'S EVEN MORE
MESSED UP THAN THAT, ACTUALLY.

18:16.846 --> 18:20.890
I DON'T THINK--
I DON'T THINK THAT JACK IS
THE ONE WHO MOVED THE BODY.

18:20.890 --> 18:22.562
- BUT THERE'S D.N.A.,
THE PHONE.
- YEAH.

18:22.562 --> 18:26.566
THAT MEANS THE PERSON
WHO'S FRAMING HIM IS
DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB.

18:26.566 --> 18:28.528
- FRAMING HIM?
WHO WOULD-- WHO WOULD--
- CHARLIE.

18:28.528 --> 18:31.110
- THIS AGAIN?
- IT'S LIKE WHEN
WE WERE IN JUVIE.

18:31.110 --> 18:34.113
HE COVERED FOR ME WHEN
I GOT INTO THIS FIGHT.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.075
HE SAID THAT
HE BEAT UP THIS KID,
BUT REALLY I DID.

18:36.075 --> 18:39.789
AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT--
I THOUGHT THAT HE WAS
HELPING ME, BUT...

18:39.789 --> 18:42.662
I JUST THINK THAT HE WAS
REALLY HELPING HIMSELF.

18:42.662 --> 18:45.915
- HOW?
- PEOPLE STARTED
LOOKING UP TO HIM,

18:45.915 --> 18:48.748
THEY WERE SCARED OF HIM,
AND I FELT LIKE I OWED HIM,

18:48.748 --> 18:50.340
SO I DID
WHATEVER HE WANTED.

18:50.340 --> 18:53.803
HE'S GOOD AT THAT.
HE'S GOOD AT TWISTING
PEOPLE LIKE THAT.

18:53.803 --> 18:55.465
SO WHAT'S
HE TRYING TO GET NOW?

18:56.466 --> 18:58.848
- HMM?
- I DON'T KNOW.

18:58.848 --> 19:00.390
I JUST-- I THINK--

19:00.390 --> 19:04.063
IT MIGHT BE CRAZY,
BUT I THINK HE WANTS MY LIFE.

19:05.475 --> 19:07.817
- LOOK, DANNY--
- HE STOLE THIS PHOTO

19:07.817 --> 19:09.229
OF THE THREE OF US,
AND THEN HE COMES--

19:09.229 --> 19:11.481
THEN HE COMES HERE TO MY TOWN?
IT'S LIKE HE'S OBSESSED.

19:11.481 --> 19:14.364
HMM. LOOK, IT'S A LONG WAY
FROM STEALING A PHOTO

19:14.364 --> 19:17.617
AND THE GIRL YOU CLEARLY LIKE

19:17.617 --> 19:21.040
- TO WANTING YOUR LIFE.
- YEAH, YOU DON'T KNOW--
YOU DON'T KNOW CHARLIE

19:21.040 --> 19:22.412
THE WAY THAT I DO, OKAY?

19:22.412 --> 19:24.624
AND HE'S THE ONLY PERSON
WHO MAKES SENSE.

19:24.624 --> 19:26.746
'CAUSE HE'S THE ONE
THAT'S OBSESSED.

19:26.746 --> 19:28.918
OKAY, I'M MOVING OUT.

19:28.918 --> 19:31.961
- WHAT? WHY?
- BECAUSE MY DAD
JUST TOLD ME TO.

19:31.961 --> 19:33.923
WH-- WHY WOULD
HE SAY THAT?

19:33.923 --> 19:35.925
I JUST GOT HIM THIS LAWYER,
I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN--

19:35.925 --> 19:37.757
I DON'T KNOW, DANNY.
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY

19:37.757 --> 19:39.599
SOMETHING GOING ON THAT
YOU GUYS AREN'T TELLING ME.

19:41.100 --> 19:43.563
WHAT-- WHAT DID
HE SAY EXACTLY, WHITNEY?

19:43.563 --> 19:45.435
HE SAID THAT YOU
AND KAREN BROKE HIS HEART.

19:47.106 --> 19:48.648
HE'S A MESS, DANNY.

19:50.900 --> 19:52.862
- CAN I STAY WITH YOU?
- YEAH, OF COURSE.

19:52.862 --> 19:54.944
- THANK YOU.
- LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

20:01.080 --> 20:02.912
- Kyle: SHE LOOKS
JUST LIKE YOU.
- Jo: RIGHT?

20:02.912 --> 20:04.374
I MEAN
EVEN MORE THAN ME,

20:04.374 --> 20:06.916
'CAUSE I CLEARLY GOT
THE MASTERSON CHIN.

20:08.087 --> 20:09.919
SAMANTHA.

20:09.919 --> 20:12.171
I ALWAYS THOUGHT I WOULD'VE
NAMED HER CATHERINE.

20:12.171 --> 20:14.924
AT LEAST NOW I WON'T
ALWAYS BE WONDERING.

20:16.836 --> 20:18.428
NOW WE CAN BOTH MOVE ON.

20:31.901 --> 20:32.902
( door closes )

20:35.445 --> 20:37.116
HOW LONG HAVE
YOU BEEN STANDING THERE?

20:37.116 --> 20:39.989
SORRY, I DIDN'T
WANT TO INTERRUPT.
THINGS LOOKED A LITTLE--

20:39.989 --> 20:41.781
YEAH, IT'S BEEN INTENSE.

20:43.453 --> 20:46.996
I GAINED AND LOST A SISTER
IN LESS THAN 12 HOURS.

20:46.996 --> 20:48.538
THAT IS INTENSE.

20:48.538 --> 20:50.370
I DON'T THINK
IT'S REALLY SUNK IN YET.

20:50.370 --> 20:55.174
ALSO, I THINK I'M AVOIDING
EVERYTHING WITH JACK AND...

20:56.296 --> 20:57.837
DANNY SAYS HE HAS
A PLAN, THOUGH.

20:57.837 --> 21:00.590
- WHAT IS IT?
- HE WOULDN'T TELL ME.

21:00.590 --> 21:03.843
- BUT YOU TRUST HIM?
- I MEAN, THE WORST
THAT HE CAN DO

21:03.843 --> 21:06.306
IS TELL THE TRUTH AND--

21:06.306 --> 21:08.768
AND MAYBE THAT'S
NOT SUCH A BAD THING.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.020
NO, JO, I CAN'T JUST
LET YOU THROW YOUR LIFE AWAY.

21:11.020 --> 21:13.693
I CAN'T LET
JACK TAKE THE BLAME
FOR SOMETHING THAT I DID.

21:13.693 --> 21:15.945
- YO, YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
- YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE,

21:15.945 --> 21:18.488
CARRYING THIS SECRET,
LYING TO MY PARENTS.

21:18.488 --> 21:20.530
YES. I DO.

21:22.362 --> 21:25.825
I KNOW HOW HARD THAT MUST BE,
BUT THAT'S NOTHING

21:25.825 --> 21:27.407
COMPARED TO WHAT YOUR LIFE
IS GOING TO BE LIKE.

21:27.407 --> 21:29.959
IT'S NOT ABOUT ME.
IT'S ABOUT DOING
WHAT'S RIGHT.

21:29.959 --> 21:32.211
IT'S DANNY'S--
HE'S DRAGGING YOU
INTO ALL THIS.

21:32.211 --> 21:34.624
HE'S THE ONE
THAT KILLED VIKRAM, NOT YOU.

21:36.215 --> 21:39.679
LOOK, YOUR MOM
JUST LOST A DAUGHTER.

21:40.840 --> 21:42.051
SHE CAN'T LOSE YOU, TOO.

21:43.923 --> 21:45.845
- ( lock buzzes )
- ( door opens )

21:45.845 --> 21:48.227
( people chattering )

21:48.227 --> 21:50.229
( cuffs clicking )

21:54.023 --> 21:57.066
( sighs deeply )

22:00.319 --> 22:02.652
I THINK I KNOW
WHO'S FRAMING YOU.

22:02.652 --> 22:05.745
AND I THINK
HE'S DOING IT TO GET TO ME.

22:07.286 --> 22:09.078
DANNY, WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

22:09.078 --> 22:12.121
( sighs ) CHARLIE.

22:12.121 --> 22:14.914
- WHO'S CHARLIE?
- HE'S THIS GUY I WENT
TO JUVIE WITH.

22:15.915 --> 22:17.717
WE WERE FRIENDS,
BUT THEN...

22:19.919 --> 22:23.342
MAYBE HE STAGED
THE CAR ACCIDENT

22:23.342 --> 22:25.425
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT
THAT HE WAS HELPING ME,

22:25.425 --> 22:27.727
BUT I THINK
THAT HE'S DOING THAT

22:27.727 --> 22:29.559
SO HE CAN HAVE
SOMETHING ON ME.

22:29.559 --> 22:31.851
AND NOW HE'S CASHING
THAT CHIP IN.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.603
BY PINNING IT ON ME?

22:33.603 --> 22:36.396
NO. HE KNOWS I'M NOT
GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN.

22:37.777 --> 22:39.529
HE'S TRYING--
HE'S TRYING TO FORCE
MY HAND,

22:39.529 --> 22:40.820
GET ME TO CONFESS.

22:40.820 --> 22:42.822
DANNY, WHY WOULD
HE WANT YOU TO DO THAT?

22:42.822 --> 22:44.323
TO GET RID OF ME

22:44.323 --> 22:46.946
SO HE CAN--
HE CAN HAVE MY LIFE,

22:46.946 --> 22:48.788
I MEAN,
HE ALREADY HAS JO.

22:49.789 --> 22:51.250
JO?

22:51.250 --> 22:53.122
ALWAYS ABOUT A GIRL, HUH?

22:53.122 --> 22:54.414
( chuckles )

22:54.414 --> 22:57.627
( scoffs )
AMAZING WHAT WE DO
FOR THE WOMEN WE LOVE.

23:00.129 --> 23:01.501
IS THAT WHY
YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING?

23:03.763 --> 23:05.425
BECAUSE YOU LOVE MY MOM?

23:07.006 --> 23:09.098
AT FIRST,
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING.

23:09.098 --> 23:10.720
THEN I THOUGHT ABOUT
WHAT SHE SAID,

23:10.720 --> 23:12.772
MOVING A BODY
TO PROTECT YOU.

23:14.313 --> 23:15.515
FIGURED IT OUT.

23:15.515 --> 23:17.897
I HAVE $10 MILLION,

23:17.897 --> 23:20.440
AND I WILL SPEND
EVERY PENNY OF IT

23:20.440 --> 23:22.982
TRYING TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE
IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES.

23:24.113 --> 23:26.115
I DON'T THINK MONEY IS
ALL IT'S GONNA TAKE, DANNY.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.238
( sighs )

23:29.238 --> 23:31.030
Lacey:
LISTEN, WHITNEY,
I'M REALLY SORRY

23:31.030 --> 23:32.912
ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT'S
HAPPENING WITH YOUR DAD,

23:32.912 --> 23:36.456
AND I'M EVEN MORE SORRY
THAT I CAN'T TELL YOU
EVERYTHING.

23:36.456 --> 23:37.917
- IT'S JUST--
- IT'S OKAY.

23:37.917 --> 23:42.502
I DON'T KNOW WHY,
BUT I STILL FEEL LIKE
I CAN TRUST YOU.

23:42.502 --> 23:44.383
YOU CAN.

23:45.465 --> 23:46.966
I REALLY CARE
ABOUT YOU, WHITNEY.

23:49.849 --> 23:51.851
( motor whirring )

23:53.312 --> 23:56.856
SO ARE WE EVER GONNA TALK
ABOUT THE KISS OR...

23:59.108 --> 24:01.060
I MEAN, CLEARLY YOU'VE
BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT.

24:01.060 --> 24:04.023
YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING
YOU CAN TO KEEP ME OFF
OF YOUR BED.

24:04.023 --> 24:07.276
N-NO. I USE THIS
FOR ALL OF MY SLEEPOVERS.

24:07.276 --> 24:08.948
I HAVE A LOT OF SLEEPOVERS
AND THIS IS WHAT I USE.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.830
- ( laughing )
- I'M NOT TRYING TO--

24:10.830 --> 24:14.333
SERIOUSLY!
AND ALSO,
OUT OF RESPECT--

24:14.333 --> 24:17.456
I'M A SPRAWLER,
SO I THOUGHT YOU'D BE
MORE COMFORTABLE ON THIS.

24:17.456 --> 24:20.840
- THIS IS A NICE AIR MATTRESS.
- YEAH, SURE, LACE.
THAT'S-- THAT'S IT.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.045
GAH. OKAY, FINE,

24:26.045 --> 24:27.677
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT IT A LOT,

24:27.677 --> 24:28.928
AND THE TRUTH IS...

24:33.853 --> 24:36.355
- I'M REALLY CONFUSED.
- BECAUSE...?

24:38.017 --> 24:40.309
I KINDA LIKED IT.

24:40.309 --> 24:43.192
- HMM.
- A LOT MORE THAN I THOUGHT
I WOULD, ACTUALLY.

24:46.155 --> 24:49.198
- DOES THAT MEAN
I'M A LESBIAN?
- ( chuckles )

24:49.198 --> 24:50.740
'CAUSE I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN INTO GUYS,

24:50.740 --> 24:53.282
AND I JUST
RECENTLY FOUND OUT
THAT MY DAD'S GAY,

24:53.282 --> 24:54.914
- SO ACTUALLY--
- YOUR DADDY'S GAY?

24:54.914 --> 24:56.916
THAT IS SO CHIC.

24:56.916 --> 25:00.079
BUT I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE
PUT LABELS ON THINGS.

25:00.079 --> 25:01.881
OH, SO YOU'RE--
SO YOU'RE NOT--

25:01.881 --> 25:02.962
OH, DEFINITELY A LESBIAN.

25:02.962 --> 25:05.545
FOR ME, IT'S ALWAYS
AND ONLY BEEN GIRLS.

25:07.046 --> 25:08.888
OH.

25:08.888 --> 25:12.221
LOOK, WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN US WAS...

25:12.221 --> 25:13.973
A MOMENT.

25:15.264 --> 25:17.807
A REALLY GREAT MOMENT.

25:17.807 --> 25:19.559
BUT IF YOU'RE CONFUSED,

25:19.559 --> 25:21.771
YOU SHOULD TAKE YOUR TIME
FIGURING THAT OUT.

25:23.062 --> 25:25.565
AND I'LL GIVE YOU
ALL THE SPACE YOU NEED.

25:25.565 --> 25:27.857
( sighs )
THANKS.

25:27.857 --> 25:28.988
MM-HMM.

25:31.200 --> 25:33.783
- SO, GOOD NIGHT.
- ( both laugh )

25:35.154 --> 25:37.707
GOOD NIGHT.
( sighs )

25:44.714 --> 25:47.006
JUST F.Y.I. THOUGH...

25:48.127 --> 25:50.129
IF YOU WAKE UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

25:50.129 --> 25:53.092
FEELING ANY LESS CONFUSED,
I'LL BE DOWN HERE.

26:01.020 --> 26:03.643
( neighs )

26:11.901 --> 26:15.324
WHAT IS THIS?
I NEED TO CALL
THE POLICE, DESAI?

26:15.324 --> 26:16.535
YOUR DOOR WAS OPEN.

26:20.830 --> 26:23.873
LOOK, I KNOW--
I KNOW THINGS KIND OF
GOT OUT OF CONTROL...

26:24.964 --> 26:26.916
BUT WE USED TO BE
PRETTY GOOD FRIENDS.

26:26.916 --> 26:28.798
YEAH, I KNOW.
I WAS THERE.

26:31.130 --> 26:33.382
AND I GOTTA BELIEVE
THAT SOMEWHERE

26:33.382 --> 26:35.054
DEEP DOWN INSIDE

26:35.054 --> 26:36.806
THAT THIS GOOD PERSON

26:36.806 --> 26:38.638
STILL EXISTS.

26:38.638 --> 26:40.309
"DEEP DOWN INSIDE"?

26:40.309 --> 26:42.722
GEE, THANKS.

26:42.722 --> 26:46.355
COME ON, YOU DON'T WANT
TO SEND AN INNOCENT MAN
TO PRISON.

26:46.355 --> 26:47.987
I ASSUME
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT JACK.

26:47.987 --> 26:51.991
AS FAR AS
GOING DOWN FOR MURDER,
THAT'S ON YOU.

26:51.991 --> 26:53.572
AND YOU TOO.

26:54.864 --> 26:56.445
YOU'RE THE ONE
FRAMING HIM.

26:56.445 --> 26:59.869
( scoffs )
MAN, YOU MUST
REALLY THINK A LOT OF ME.

26:59.869 --> 27:04.043
I MEAN, TO GET JACK'S D.N.A.,
PLANT IT IN YOUR FATHER'S CAR,

27:04.043 --> 27:07.166
LOAD A DEAD BODY INTO IT,
ALL BEFORE STAGING
A CAR ACCIDENT?

27:07.166 --> 27:10.089
YEAH, AND THEN PLANT
MY DAD'S CELLPHONE
AT THE BOATHOUSE,

27:10.089 --> 27:13.302
WHICH PUTS PRESSURE ON JACK,
WHICH PUT PRESSURE ON ME.

27:13.302 --> 27:15.464
- DUDE, THAT'S CRAZY.
- ADMIT IT-- YOU WANT ME
TO CONFESS.

27:15.464 --> 27:17.967
IF I WANTED TO,
I COULD JUST TURN YOU IN.

27:17.967 --> 27:20.309
THEN YOU WOULDN'T LOOK
SO GOOD IN FRONT OF JO,

27:20.309 --> 27:23.022
WHICH IS THE POINT,
RIGHT?

27:23.973 --> 27:25.855
YOU'VE REALLY THOUGHT
THIS THROUGH, HUH?

27:25.855 --> 27:27.606
IF WE CAN START TALKING
ABOUT THE TRUTH,

27:27.606 --> 27:29.979
THEN I CAN START FIGURING OUT
WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT.

27:33.032 --> 27:34.984
I WOULD LOVE
TO HELP YOU OUT, DANNY,

27:34.984 --> 27:37.867
'CAUSE I AM A GOOD PERSON
DEEP DOWN INSIDE.

27:37.867 --> 27:39.829
AND I KNOW THAT
YOU'RE IN A TIGHT SPOT
AND EVERYTHING--

27:39.829 --> 27:42.121
( clattering )

27:42.121 --> 27:43.452
DON'T LIE TO ME!

27:44.663 --> 27:47.126
SCREW YOU.
YOU'RE JUST PISSED

27:47.126 --> 27:49.168
BECAUSE I SAW SOMETHING
IN JO THAT YOU NEVER SAW,

27:49.168 --> 27:51.420
SOMETHING YOU MISSED
FOR YEARS.

27:51.420 --> 27:53.923
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- WHAT IS IT YOU CALLED HER?

27:53.923 --> 27:57.056
A SHY LITTLE PUPPY DOG?
( laughing )

27:59.298 --> 28:01.220
DID YOU READ
MY JOURNAL?

28:01.220 --> 28:03.102
DID YOU READ MY JOURNAL?!

28:03.102 --> 28:04.603
NO, I JUST...

28:05.975 --> 28:07.686
FORGET IT.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.398
YOU NEED HELP, MAN.

28:10.439 --> 28:11.941
YEAH, WELL, SO DO YOU.

28:17.616 --> 28:20.870
( door opens, closes )

28:29.498 --> 28:31.500
( chattering )

28:32.752 --> 28:34.463
HEY, WHITNEY.

28:34.463 --> 28:36.595
I'M SORRY
ABOUT YOUR DAD.

28:36.595 --> 28:40.429
- YOU OKAY?
- GREAT, IF YOU LIKE
BEING TOTALLY IN THE DARK.

28:40.429 --> 28:42.221
- YEAH, THAT'S--
- SUCKS,

28:42.221 --> 28:45.644
BUT EVEN MY DAD SEEMS
TO WANT IT THAT WAY, SO...

28:47.686 --> 28:50.519
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,
LACEY'S BEEN AMAZING.

28:50.519 --> 28:52.351
I'M LUCKY TO HAVE HER.

28:52.351 --> 28:54.273
YEAH, LACEY'S GREAT.

28:56.405 --> 28:59.488
TELL YOU WHAT:
I'M GONNA GO USE
THE LITTLE GIRLS'.

28:59.488 --> 29:00.860
YOU GUYS CHAT.

29:03.993 --> 29:06.285
( whispering )
JO, HAVE YOU TALKED
TO DANNY?

29:06.285 --> 29:08.537
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS GONNA DO?
- I DON'T KNOW. HE SHUT ME OUT.

29:08.537 --> 29:10.499
YEAH, BECAUSE HE'S CONVINCED
THAT HE CAN NAIL CHARLIE.

29:12.001 --> 29:15.254
- FOR WHAT?
- FOR-- FOR MOVING THE BODY

29:15.254 --> 29:17.546
- AND NOW FOR FRAMING JACK.
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

29:17.546 --> 29:19.929
I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND.
CHARLIE COULD NEVER DO THAT.

29:19.929 --> 29:21.720
JO, I DON'T KNOW.

29:21.720 --> 29:24.223
DANNY'S A LITTLE
OFF THE RAILS RIGHT NOW.

29:24.223 --> 29:25.975
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
I THOUGHT HE HAD A PLAN.

29:25.975 --> 29:27.726
HE'S JUST MAKING
EVERYTHING WORSE.

29:30.559 --> 29:33.312
DANNY, WE NEED TO TALK.
CALL ME BACK.

29:34.984 --> 29:36.986
( buzzes )

29:39.989 --> 29:41.700
( muttering )
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

29:46.615 --> 29:48.998
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- UH, I HAVE TO--

29:48.998 --> 29:51.120
I HAVE TO
WRITE ALL THIS DOWN
SO IT'S DOCUMENTED

29:51.120 --> 29:52.872
IN CASE I DON'T GET
A CHANCE TO.

29:52.872 --> 29:54.373
TO WHAT?

29:54.373 --> 29:57.546
IT'S ALL CHARLIE.
I CAN'T LET HIM GET
AWAY WITH IT.

29:57.546 --> 29:59.969
I HAVE TO MAKE SURE
THAT JO IS SAFE.

29:59.969 --> 30:01.800
- WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THAT CHARLIE--
- IT'S NOT--

30:01.800 --> 30:04.803
IT IS NOT JUST JO.
IT-IT-- IT'S LACEY, TOO.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.345
HE STARTED WITH LACEY.
IT'S ALL--

30:06.345 --> 30:08.727
- IT'S ALL THREE OF US.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

30:09.808 --> 30:11.430
( sighs )

30:11.430 --> 30:14.103
I MADE A PROMISE TO JACK,

30:14.103 --> 30:16.485
- AND THAT LAWYER
IS NOT GONNA--
- HOLD ON.

30:16.485 --> 30:18.197
THAT LAWYER IS
WORKING ON IT.

30:18.197 --> 30:20.900
AND THE ONLY WAY
TO SAVE JACK IS BY
TURNING YOURSELF IN, SO--

30:20.900 --> 30:23.742
I'M NOT LETTING
JACK GO TO JAIL,
BECAUSE HE LOVES YOU, MOM.

30:23.742 --> 30:25.494
IT'S HIS DECISION.

30:25.494 --> 30:27.366
HE'S A GROWN MAN.
HE'S NOT AN INNOCENT CHILD.

30:27.366 --> 30:30.329
- WELL, NEITHER AM I!
- ( papers rustle )

30:36.215 --> 30:38.377
PLEASE DON'T
DO THIS TO ME.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.381
I'LL BE ALL ALONE.

30:44.423 --> 30:46.555
YOU-- HOW CAN
YOU SAY THESE THINGS?

30:46.555 --> 30:49.518
YOU LOVE HIM, RIGHT?
YOU LOVE JACK.

30:49.518 --> 30:51.270
I LOVE YOU MORE.

30:51.270 --> 30:53.522
AND IF JACK NEEDS
TO GO TO JAIL TO SAVE YOU,

30:53.522 --> 30:56.475
- SO BE IT.
- THAT IS SICK, OKAY?

30:56.475 --> 30:58.607
THAT IS A MAN'S LIFE,
AND I'M DONE WITH THIS.

30:58.607 --> 31:00.479
- PLEASE, I'M BEGGING YOU!
- NO!

31:17.586 --> 31:19.298
( door opens )

31:19.298 --> 31:20.709
HEY.

31:20.709 --> 31:24.673
SO... I DON'T KNOW HOW WELL
GARLIC BREAD HOLDS UP, BUT...

31:25.764 --> 31:27.886
SORRY, I JUST--

31:27.886 --> 31:29.388
WHAT'S WRONG?

31:29.388 --> 31:31.390
THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO...

31:32.471 --> 31:33.892
I'LL BE BACK.

31:39.979 --> 31:43.282
( people chattering )

31:46.865 --> 31:49.028
- YOU HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.
- YOU TOO.

31:50.029 --> 31:51.450
DR. BERGER!

31:52.451 --> 31:53.412
DESAI?

31:53.412 --> 31:54.954
( car door shuts )

31:54.954 --> 31:56.455
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

32:26.365 --> 32:29.028
( clicks, ringing )

32:29.028 --> 32:30.949
- This is Jo.
leave a message.
- ( beeps )

32:30.949 --> 32:33.872
HEY, JO, IT'S--
IT'S ME.

32:33.872 --> 32:36.996
I KNOW YOU GOT
A LOT GOING ON, BUT...

32:37.997 --> 32:39.918
DANNY WAS HERE
AND HE HAS THESE--

32:39.918 --> 32:41.840
THESE CRAZY IDEAS...

32:41.840 --> 32:44.883
AND... HE BEAT ME UP...

32:44.883 --> 32:46.465
PRETTY BAD...

32:46.465 --> 32:49.298
AND... I'M IN
A LOT OF PAIN.

32:49.298 --> 32:51.510
I WAS WONDERING
IF MAYBE YOU COULD COME OVER.

32:53.262 --> 32:55.934
SO HOPEFULLY I'LL...

32:55.934 --> 32:57.516
SEE YOU SOON.

32:58.557 --> 32:59.898
OKAY.

33:01.230 --> 33:02.861
( beeps, clatters )

33:07.196 --> 33:08.527
( sighs )

33:17.786 --> 33:19.578
( groans )

33:25.504 --> 33:27.506
JUST COME INSIDE.
WE CAN SIT, GET WARM,

33:27.506 --> 33:29.628
- TALK ABOUT
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO.
- NO NO, SORRY.

33:29.628 --> 33:32.131
THERE'S NO TIME.
I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT--

33:32.131 --> 33:33.342
ABOUT CHARLIE.

33:34.433 --> 33:36.895
HE MOVED TO MY TOWN
RIGHT AFTER HE GOT OUT.

33:36.895 --> 33:39.268
- CHARLIE McBRIDE?
- LOOK, I NEED YOU

33:39.268 --> 33:40.979
TO TELL ME ANYTHING
YOU KNOW ABOUT CHARLIE.

33:40.979 --> 33:42.441
DANNY, YOU KNOW
I CAN'T DO THAT.

33:42.441 --> 33:44.483
I AM BOUND BY RULES
OF CONFIDENTIALITY,

33:44.483 --> 33:46.315
- AND IF--
- OKAY, FINE FINE! JUST...

33:46.315 --> 33:48.447
( sighs )

33:48.447 --> 33:51.450
I THINK THAT
CHARLIE'S DANGEROUS.

33:51.450 --> 33:54.413
OKAY? AND I WANT
TO MAKE SURE THAT
I'M RIGHT BEFORE I...

33:55.954 --> 33:57.706
BEFORE YOU WHAT, DANNY?

33:57.706 --> 33:59.618
EVERYBODY'S SAYING
THAT I'M CRAZY,

33:59.618 --> 34:01.540
AND I FEEL
LIKE I'M LOSING IT.

34:02.791 --> 34:04.543
AND I GOTTA KNOW.

34:06.085 --> 34:07.466
AM I?

34:09.378 --> 34:11.170
( sighs )

34:11.170 --> 34:13.302
YOU'RE NOT CRAZY, DANNY.

34:13.302 --> 34:15.514
YOU WERE NEVER CRAZY.
YOU KNOW THAT.

34:17.436 --> 34:19.268
SO CHARLIE'S...?

34:20.559 --> 34:24.893
HAS A PAST,
LIKE ALL YOU BOYS DO, BUT...

34:26.815 --> 34:28.687
THERE'S MORE TO HIM
YOU DON'T KNOW.

34:30.189 --> 34:31.450
NONE OF IT'S GOOD.

34:33.492 --> 34:35.494
THEN I KNOW
WHAT I NEED TO DO.

34:35.494 --> 34:39.408
DANNY.
DANNY, WAIT. I--

34:39.408 --> 34:42.161
- ( engine starts, revs )
- I CAN GET IN TOUCH WITH
HIS PAROLE OFFICER!

34:43.202 --> 34:44.503
( tires screech )

34:46.335 --> 34:48.337
( doorbell chimes )

34:50.469 --> 34:52.010
- HI.
- HI, UH...

34:52.010 --> 34:53.882
I'M SORRY, BUT...

34:53.882 --> 34:56.925
THIS BRACELET
AROUND SAMANTHA'S ANKLE.

34:56.925 --> 34:59.678
- THE HOSPITAL TAG?
- DID SHE GET SICK

34:59.678 --> 35:02.431
RIGHT AFTER SHE WAS BORN?
IS THAT WHY SHE WAS THERE?

35:02.431 --> 35:05.184
NO, I MEAN,
SHE WAS BORN
IN THE HOSPITAL.

35:05.184 --> 35:06.855
( stammers )

35:06.855 --> 35:08.777
I-- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

35:08.777 --> 35:11.940
I PICKED HER UP
MAYBE 12 HOURS AFTERWARDS

35:11.940 --> 35:14.573
FROM THAT MEDICAL CENTER
OVER IN TRENTON.

35:16.865 --> 35:19.077
BUT MY BABY WASN'T BORN
IN THE HOSPITAL.

35:20.449 --> 35:22.411
WE WERE
AT A FARMHOUSE UPSTATE.

35:22.411 --> 35:26.505
OH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING, TESS. I...

35:28.837 --> 35:30.839
I DON'T THINK
THIS IS MY BABY.

35:34.213 --> 35:37.466
- ( moaning softly )
- ( knocks on door )

35:38.677 --> 35:41.350
YEAH. COMING.

35:44.853 --> 35:46.144
( sighs )

35:59.658 --> 36:01.490
OH MY GOD.

36:01.490 --> 36:02.991
YEAH.

36:04.082 --> 36:05.954
DANNY KINDA LOST IT.

36:07.085 --> 36:09.047
LOOK, JO,

36:09.047 --> 36:11.500
I THINK IT'S TIME
TO DO SOMETHING.

36:12.501 --> 36:13.922
I MEAN, YOU SAID YOURSELF

36:13.922 --> 36:16.795
JACK CAN'T SIT
AND ROT IN A JAIL.

36:19.258 --> 36:20.969
I THINK THAT
YOU SHOULD GO TO YOUR DAD,

36:20.969 --> 36:22.601
TELL HIM WHAT DANNY DID

36:22.601 --> 36:24.513
AND LEAVE YOURSELF
OUT OF IT.

36:24.513 --> 36:27.606
- HOW COULD I DO THAT?
- LOOK, JUST SAY THAT DANNY
WAS BY HIMSELF,

36:27.606 --> 36:31.610
THAT HE TOLD YOU
THAT HE KILLED VIKRAM.

36:31.610 --> 36:33.402
DANNY'LL BACK YOU UP ON IT.

36:33.402 --> 36:35.193
HE-- HE LOVES YOU.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.575
I DON'T THINK THAT...

36:37.776 --> 36:39.658
AND ANYWAY,
WITHOUT ANYONE THERE

36:39.658 --> 36:41.320
- TO PROVE
IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE--
- I KNOW.

36:41.320 --> 36:43.201
I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU CARE ABOUT DANNY--

36:43.201 --> 36:45.374
- I CARE ABOUT
TELLING THE TRUTH.
- SCREW THE TRUTH!

36:45.374 --> 36:46.825
LOOK AT MY FACE!

36:49.538 --> 36:52.170
LOOK, I'M SORRY.
I JUST...

36:53.592 --> 36:56.465
LOOK, I DON'T WANNA
LOSE YOU, OKAY?

36:56.465 --> 36:58.927
I MEAN, I JUST--
I JUST GOT YOU.

36:58.927 --> 37:02.471
I'VE BEEN DREAMING
ABOUT THIS MOMENT FOREVER,

37:02.471 --> 37:04.763
I MEAN, SINCE BEFORE
WE EVEN MET, AND--

37:04.763 --> 37:06.475
WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

37:09.398 --> 37:11.270
( sighs )

37:11.270 --> 37:13.442
WHEN I WAS IN JUVIE,

37:13.442 --> 37:15.193
I SAW
DANNY'S PICTURES OF YOU.

37:15.193 --> 37:16.985
AND...

37:16.985 --> 37:18.947
JO, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
THAT EVERYTHING

37:18.947 --> 37:20.619
THAT I HAVE DONE--
EVERYTHING--

37:20.619 --> 37:23.492
- HAS BEEN FOR YOU.
- WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

37:23.492 --> 37:26.325
- OKAY, LET ME--
LET ME-- LET ME--
- WHAT HAVE YOU DONE, CHARLIE?

37:26.325 --> 37:29.247
LET ME JUST EXPLAIN, OKAY?
LOOK, WHAT--

37:29.247 --> 37:31.670
- WHEN I SAW WHAT
HAPPENED AT THE RAVINE...
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,

37:31.670 --> 37:33.542
- "WHEN YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED"?
- ...I KNEW THAT I HAD
TO DO SOMETHING.

37:33.542 --> 37:36.214
- AND I WAS JUST TRYING
TO HELP DANNY, OKAY?
- OH MY GOD, I HAVE TO GO.

37:36.214 --> 37:37.796
WAIT! JO, JUST WAIT, OKAY?

37:37.796 --> 37:39.928
- PLEASE!
- LET ME GO!

37:41.590 --> 37:43.051
- ( yells )
- ( door closes )

37:46.725 --> 37:48.226
( knocks )

37:51.600 --> 37:53.312
HEY, IS JO HERE?

37:53.312 --> 37:55.524
NO, SHE'S OUT
WITH CHARLIE,
I THINK. WHY?

37:59.157 --> 38:02.030
CHIEF MASTERSON,
YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG GUY.

38:03.612 --> 38:05.664
JACK DIDN'T KILL MY FATHER.

38:06.745 --> 38:07.956
I DID.

38:10.409 --> 38:11.830
MY DAD AND I,
WE GOT INTO A FIGHT

38:11.830 --> 38:13.542
BY THE RAVINE
NEAR THE OLD POST CHURCH

38:13.542 --> 38:15.964
AND HE TRIED TO KILL ME,
SO I HIT HIM WITH
A PIECE OF WOOD.

38:15.964 --> 38:18.126
YOU HAVE TO STOP
TALKING RIGHT NOW.
I'M TAKING YOU IN.

38:18.126 --> 38:20.218
- WE'RE GONNA
DO THIS BY THE BOOK.
- I KNOW WE WILL.

38:21.049 --> 38:22.421
- TURN AROUND.
- ( handcuffs clicking )

38:26.425 --> 38:28.056
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

38:29.638 --> 38:31.810
DANNY CONFESSED
TO KILLING HIS FATHER.

38:40.899 --> 38:44.072
I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE
OR WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN
YOU AND CHARLIE,

38:44.072 --> 38:46.825
I THINK
YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT HIM.

38:46.825 --> 38:49.748
I CAN'T DO THIS
ANYMORE, DANNY.
I HAVE TO CONFESS.

38:51.079 --> 38:53.081
( police radio chatter )

39:03.171 --> 39:05.093
HEY, UM...

39:06.134 --> 39:08.266
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
SLEEP UP HERE.

39:09.728 --> 39:11.229
ARE YOU SURE?

39:11.229 --> 39:13.271
I MEAN,
I'M ALL ABOUT THE COZY,

39:13.271 --> 39:14.933
BUT IF YOU'RE
REALLY A SPRAWLER,

39:14.933 --> 39:16.274
- I DON'T WANNA--
- JUST GET UP HERE.

39:16.274 --> 39:17.566
OKAY.

39:50.058 --> 39:51.510
I'M SO SORRY.

39:54.142 --> 39:55.514
YOU'RE NOT
FEELING IT, HUH?

39:56.605 --> 39:58.186
I DON'T THINK SO.

39:59.227 --> 40:01.019
DO YOU WANT
TO TRY IT AGAIN?

40:01.019 --> 40:03.231
- ( laughs )
- JUST TO BE SURE?

40:03.231 --> 40:05.073
YOU KNOW,
THE TRUTH IS I'M...

40:06.525 --> 40:09.157
I'M KISSING YOU
BUT I'M STILL THINKING
ABOUT DANNY.

40:09.157 --> 40:10.619
OUCH.

40:10.619 --> 40:13.291
- WHITNEY, I--
- FOR YOU, I MEAN. THAT'S...

40:13.291 --> 40:15.534
( sighs )

40:15.534 --> 40:18.206
- WHITNEY,
I REALLY LIKE YOU.
- ( sighs )

40:18.206 --> 40:20.208
I HAD SUCH A GOOD TIME
THE OTHER NIGHT, BUT I--

40:20.208 --> 40:22.130
IT'S OKAY. I'VE BEEN
TURNED DOWN BEFORE.

40:23.251 --> 40:24.543
ACTUALLY, NOT REALLY,

40:24.543 --> 40:27.095
- EVER, BUT...
- ( laughs )

40:27.095 --> 40:29.808
...I GUESS
THERE'S A FIRST TIME
FOR EVERYTHING, RIGHT?

40:31.259 --> 40:33.011
- ICE CREAM?
- DEFINITELY.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.015
SO ALL THROUGH REGINA,

40:37.015 --> 40:39.147
THE ACCUSATIONS
OF AN ENTIRE TOWN,
ALL OF IT,

40:39.147 --> 40:42.150
YOU KEPT THIS HUGE SECRET
THAT YOU DIDN'T KILL YOUR AUNT?

40:42.150 --> 40:44.733
YES SIR,
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I DID.

40:45.904 --> 40:49.027
- DANNY, THIS IS--
- I KNOW. IT IS.

40:49.027 --> 40:51.159
DOES ANYONE ELSE
KNOW ABOUT THIS?

40:51.159 --> 40:53.622
- JO, LACEY, YOUR MOTHER?
- NO SIR.

40:53.622 --> 40:55.413
NONE OF THEM
KNOW ANYTHING.

40:56.414 --> 40:58.837
AND THERE'S A PROBLEM
WITH YOUR STORY.

40:58.837 --> 41:01.500
YOUR FATHER'S BODY
WASN'T FOUND ANYWHERE
NEAR THAT RAVINE.

41:01.500 --> 41:04.713
IT WAS FOUND 10 MILES AWAY
IN A WRECKED CAR.

41:04.713 --> 41:06.084
( clears throat )
I KNOW THAT.

41:07.135 --> 41:10.138
- DID YOU MOVE THE BODY?
- NO SIR.

41:10.138 --> 41:12.140
- TRY TO COVER IT UP?
- NO SIR.

41:13.181 --> 41:14.392
BUT I KNOW WHO DID.

41:15.514 --> 41:16.645
ALL RIGHT, WHO?

41:16.645 --> 41:19.147
CHARLIE McBRIDE.

41:19.147 --> 41:21.860
- THE KID THAT'S DATING JO?
- YES SIR.

41:21.860 --> 41:24.693
- WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?
- BECAUSE HE WANTED TO HAVE
SOMETHING ON ME.

41:25.864 --> 41:27.946
WE WERE
IN JUVIE TOGETHER.

41:27.946 --> 41:30.108
AFTER HE GOT OUT,
HE CAME HERE,

41:30.108 --> 41:32.240
'CAUSE HE WANTS MY LIFE.

41:33.241 --> 41:35.243
AND THAT INCLUDES JO.

41:41.169 --> 41:42.170
( keys jingle )

41:44.673 --> 41:45.674
MOM.

41:48.216 --> 41:49.968
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- DANNY WAS HERE.

41:49.968 --> 41:51.259
HE CONFESSED
TO KILLING HIS FATHER.

41:51.259 --> 41:52.260
DO YOU THINK THAT'S TRUE?

41:54.803 --> 41:57.976
I KNOW IT IS,
BECAUSE I WAS THERE.

41:57.976 --> 41:59.397
I WAS WITH HIM.
