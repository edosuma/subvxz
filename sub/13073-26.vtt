It was all a prank! HA!

17:31.016 --> 17:32.017
{\an1}- What?
- What's she talking about?

17:32.084 --> 17:33.118
I don't get it.

17:33.185 --> 17:34.686
Ha. Nice try!

17:34.753 --> 17:37.389
You just want the surprise
for yourselves.

17:37.456 --> 17:38.557
{\an3}Yeah!

17:38.624 --> 17:40.359
Wha--
It's a prank!

17:40.426 --> 17:42.227
T-there's no arguing.

17:42.294 --> 17:44.496
We're not listening to you,
you little liar!

17:44.563 --> 17:46.298
Harvey is the one who told us
about the line!

17:46.365 --> 17:48.333
We can trust Harvey!

17:48.400 --> 17:49.835
(all)
Yeah!

17:49.902 --> 17:51.203
Oh, boy...

17:51.270 --> 17:54.139
{\an1}Whoa, that did not go
according to plan.

17:54.206 --> 17:56.241
- Well, now what do I do?!
- I don't know!

17:56.308 --> 17:59.378
But you can't just walk away
from this.

18:04.249 --> 18:06.652
Hey, where ya goin'?

18:06.718 --> 18:09.655
Oh, my gosh!
The line is moving!

18:09.721 --> 18:10.722
Look alive, Kratz.

18:10.789 --> 18:12.524
{\an3}Huh? Oh!

18:17.196 --> 18:19.531
[Harvey panting]
[crowd chattering]

18:19.598 --> 18:21.967
{\an3}Oh, I can't wait to know
what the surprise is!

18:22.034 --> 18:23.368
Yeah!

18:24.403 --> 18:25.871
What are you doing?

18:25.938 --> 18:26.872
I don't know!

18:26.939 --> 18:28.740
Trying to shake 'em!

18:39.151 --> 18:41.487
[crowd chattering]

18:41.553 --> 18:43.021
Ah! Are we at the surprise,
Harvey?!

18:43.088 --> 18:44.423
W-where is it?!

18:44.490 --> 18:46.892
Tell us before
my heart explodes!

18:46.959 --> 18:48.927
[excited chatter]

18:48.994 --> 18:50.863
Aah!

18:52.498 --> 18:56.168
O-kay, we'll just wait here
till you get back!

18:57.903 --> 19:00.839
Okay! I-I gotta tell 'em!
I gotta tell 'em!

19:00.906 --> 19:02.541
{\an1}You're not gonna tell 'em,
right?

19:02.608 --> 19:05.110
Why? What's the worst
that could happen?

19:05.177 --> 19:06.778
You'll get beat up.

19:06.845 --> 19:09.948
What?! They wouldn't do that,
would they?

19:10.015 --> 19:13.886
{\an1}Oh, yeah. Foo and I have been
beat up for WAY less than this!

19:13.952 --> 19:15.420
Then what do I do?

19:15.487 --> 19:18.590
{\an1}I don't know! You're the
mastermind behind all this!

19:18.657 --> 19:19.825
[sighs]

19:19.892 --> 19:22.694
{\an1}I guess I'm just gonna
have to go out there

19:22.761 --> 19:24.229
and face the music.

19:24.296 --> 19:27.032
Hey, everybody.

19:27.099 --> 19:29.401
[crowd cheering]

19:29.468 --> 19:31.870
I've got something
to tell you all,

19:31.937 --> 19:34.840
and it might come
as a bit of a shock.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.608
{\an1}(male)
We love you Harvey!

19:36.675 --> 19:40.312
Thank you.
Okay, so, this surprise...

19:40.379 --> 19:41.780
It's--it's, uh, it's...

19:41.847 --> 19:46.018
It's funny, really,
because, well...

19:46.084 --> 19:48.453
The surprise is...

19:48.520 --> 19:49.855
[softly]
nothing.

19:49.922 --> 19:51.490
Speak up, boy!

19:51.557 --> 19:53.959
I said it's, uh...

19:54.026 --> 19:56.028
nothing?
[coughs]

19:56.094 --> 19:58.030
Nothing?

19:58.096 --> 20:00.899
- Pranked...ya!
[crowd gasps]

20:00.966 --> 20:02.968
What kind of prank is that?

20:03.035 --> 20:05.470
Well, I guess I missed my
sister's wedding for nothing.

20:05.537 --> 20:08.373
Why do people have to lie?

20:08.440 --> 20:11.243
[disappointed chatter]

20:11.310 --> 20:13.011
{\an1}(Piri)
I don't believe it.

20:16.214 --> 20:20.619
You got pranked
by the king of pranks.

20:20.686 --> 20:21.787
[sighs]

20:24.690 --> 20:27.259
{\an3}Hey,
you're still alive!

20:27.326 --> 20:30.195
Yeah.
They didn't beat me up,

20:30.262 --> 20:32.064
but they all hate me now.

20:32.130 --> 20:34.733
{\an3}Of course they hate ya!
You pranked 'em!

20:34.800 --> 20:37.169
That didn't feel anything like
my other pranks do.

20:37.235 --> 20:40.472
{\an3}Well, you wanted to be
the king of pranks, right?

20:40.539 --> 20:43.008
{\an3}It's a small price to pay
for having the crown.

20:43.075 --> 20:46.945
But that's not the type of king
I wanted to be.

20:47.012 --> 20:49.381
Wait...that's it!

20:49.448 --> 20:51.483
I'm gonna do pranks my way!

20:51.550 --> 20:53.885
Hey, Piri Piri,
whatcha doin'?

20:53.952 --> 20:56.788
Just crying...

20:56.855 --> 20:58.156
from sadness!

20:58.223 --> 21:01.360
{\an3}Oh, I'm sorry, here,
let me get you a tissue--

21:01.426 --> 21:02.828
I pranked ya!

21:02.894 --> 21:04.262
What?

21:04.329 --> 21:07.232
It's like, totally safe
to eat and everything!

21:07.299 --> 21:08.834
King of pranks!

21:08.900 --> 21:10.402
Thanks, Harvey!

21:10.469 --> 21:12.371
[munching]

21:13.405 --> 21:15.574
Hello?

21:15.641 --> 21:17.809
Paper airplane?
Wait a tick!

21:17.876 --> 21:20.846
It's made from a $5.00 bill!

21:20.912 --> 21:22.914
Pranked ya!

21:22.981 --> 21:24.049
Ah...

21:24.116 --> 21:25.283
Ooh!

21:25.350 --> 21:28.420
[sniffing]
I smell good!

21:28.487 --> 21:29.955
It's cologne!

21:30.022 --> 21:31.423
Pranked ya!

21:31.490 --> 21:33.091
Thanks, Harvey!

21:33.158 --> 21:34.292
Thanks, Harvey!

21:34.359 --> 21:35.527
Thanks, Harvey!

21:35.594 --> 21:38.296
Ha ha! Ya got me good,
Harvey!

21:38.363 --> 21:39.631
{\an3}Thanks!

21:39.698 --> 21:41.833
{\an1}Wow, dude!
I'm impressed.

21:41.900 --> 21:43.969
People like you again <i> and</i>
you didn't get punched.

21:44.036 --> 21:46.071
Thank you. I feel pretty good
about this!

21:46.138 --> 21:47.506
Hey, I know!

21:47.572 --> 21:49.341
{\an3}We should celebrate
with some gum!

21:49.408 --> 21:51.309
Oh, uh, no thanks, Foo.

21:51.376 --> 21:52.944
Suit yourself!

21:53.011 --> 21:54.146
{\an3}[zzzzt!]
Ow!

21:54.212 --> 21:55.447
{\an6}[zzzzt!]
Ow!

21:55.514 --> 21:57.482
[zzzzt!]
Ow!

21:57.549 --> 21:58.917
Oh, tastes good!

21:58.984 --> 22:00.585
[zzzzt!]
Ow!
