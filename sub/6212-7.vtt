WEBVTT

00:01.797 --> 00:03.132
Okay, how do I look?

00:03.132 --> 00:06.135
Like a vision, an angel descended from heaven--

00:06.135 --> 00:08.204
in short,  meow!

00:08.204 --> 00:10.039
Whatever it is you want, no.

00:10.039 --> 00:12.008
I want nothing but to wish you well

00:12.008 --> 00:14.043
on your other-realm egghead retreat.

00:14.043 --> 00:16.312
You just want to get rid of me so you can have

00:16.312 --> 00:18.047
one of your wild bachelor weekends.

00:18.047 --> 00:19.382
Of all the times for Hilda

00:19.382 --> 00:21.350
to be picking coffee beans in Honduras.

00:21.350 --> 00:23.486
You don't have to worry about me partying.

00:23.486 --> 00:25.021
I'll be having a quiet weekend

00:25.021 --> 00:26.822
curled up with  Memoirs of a Geisha.

00:26.822 --> 00:27.823
I appreciate that.

00:27.823 --> 00:29.392
The last thing I want to do is

00:29.392 --> 00:31.961
stress out about you while I'm at Genius-palooza.

00:31.961 --> 00:34.397
Hurry up and get out of here so I can start missing you.

00:34.397 --> 00:35.731
(  closet doorbell rings  )

00:35.731 --> 00:36.899
Who could that be?

00:36.899 --> 00:38.634
I'm not expecting anyone...

00:38.634 --> 00:40.369
so soon.

00:40.369 --> 00:41.570
Mrs. Saberhagen?

00:41.570 --> 00:43.939
We've got your order here for 50 folding chairs

00:43.939 --> 00:46.242
deluxe fajita bar, three gallons of guacamole

00:46.242 --> 00:47.410
and... one pinata.

00:47.410 --> 00:49.545
You must be having one heck of a party.

00:49.545 --> 00:51.013
Fiesta!

00:51.013 --> 00:53.616
The fiesta's over,  gato stupido.

00:53.616 --> 00:55.885
Can't I at least keep the pinata?

00:55.885 --> 00:57.086
You  are  the pinata.

00:57.086 --> 00:59.088
(  whimpering  )

00:59.088 --> 01:02.291
You mean a stomach full of candy?

01:02.291 --> 01:04.393
Oh Henry, show me the nougat!

01:07.155 --> 01:11.155
Life's changing around me
and I'm gonna make it mine

01:13.962 --> 01:17.962
I'm reaching out and living by my rules...

01:20.502 --> 01:23.672
Time's moving way too fast

01:23.672 --> 01:27.672
I wanna make it last...

01:29.845 --> 01:33.348
'Cause I'm out on my own now

01:33.348 --> 01:37.348
And I like the way it feels.

01:44.255 --> 01:45.723
And that brings us

01:45.723 --> 01:47.658
to the very crux of existentialism.

01:47.658 --> 01:51.658
Now, can anyone... prove to me that this chair exists?

01:52.897 --> 01:53.898
Ms. Spellman?

01:53.898 --> 01:55.933
According to Descartes

01:55.933 --> 01:56.367
the fact that I perceive the chair

01:56.367 --> 01:57.768
and the fact that I perceive myself

01:57.768 --> 01:58.903
based on the fact that you perceive me...

01:58.903 --> 02:01.138
Anyone else?

02:01.138 --> 02:02.773
Mr. Goodman, prove to me

02:02.773 --> 02:04.408
that this chair exists.

02:04.408 --> 02:05.543
What chair?

02:05.543 --> 02:06.610
Brilliant.

02:06.610 --> 02:08.711
Class, take note

02:08.711 --> 02:11.448
of Mr. Goodman's unconventional perspective

02:11.448 --> 02:13.417
on the so-called... obvious.

02:13.417 --> 02:14.585
Dismissed.

02:15.052 --> 02:17.388
Great, now the other kids are going to beat me up.

02:17.388 --> 02:18.889
Miles, this isn't grade school.

02:18.889 --> 02:21.759
"Grade school"? Try K through 12.

02:21.759 --> 02:22.760
Hey, Goodman...

02:22.760 --> 02:24.595
I think I can take the girl.

02:24.595 --> 02:25.663
I got your back.

02:25.663 --> 02:27.431
Great job in Philosophy.

02:27.431 --> 02:29.333
"What chair?"-- Brilliant.

02:29.333 --> 02:30.935
Oh, thanks.

02:30.935 --> 02:32.937
I wonder if it'll work with, "What homework?"

02:32.937 --> 02:36.407
You know, technically, there really was a chair in there.

02:36.407 --> 02:39.009
It was brown. You could see it.

02:39.009 --> 02:40.411
Forget it.

02:40.411 --> 02:42.646
We just wanted to say that we're blown away

02:42.646 --> 02:45.049
by your intellect and your whole take on life.

02:45.049 --> 02:47.885
You seem like the kind of guy who's open to new ideas.

02:47.885 --> 02:49.119
Definitely. You should see

02:49.119 --> 02:51.522
the bizarre electronic equipment he has in his room

02:51.522 --> 02:53.858
and he claims he can communicate with... no one.

02:53.858 --> 02:56.560
Jason and I just joined a group you might be interested in.

02:56.560 --> 02:59.230
It's dedicated to the exploration of alternate realities

02:59.230 --> 03:01.165
and the search for truth in the universe.

03:01.165 --> 03:02.967
Wow, sounds like it's right up your alley.

03:02.967 --> 03:05.069
We have open meetings every Friday night

03:05.069 --> 03:06.770
and we'd love it if you came by.

03:06.770 --> 03:07.805
No, thanks. I'm not...

03:07.805 --> 03:08.806
He'll be there.

03:08.806 --> 03:10.774
Great. Bye.

03:12.409 --> 03:13.577
Since when are you my mother?

03:13.577 --> 03:14.511
I'm not going to that group

03:14.511 --> 03:16.547
and I'm not calling you and Dad when I get there.

03:16.547 --> 03:17.548
You know, you never go out.

03:17.548 --> 03:19.617
Do you have any social life at all?

03:19.617 --> 03:22.586
This is it. I'm making eye contact and everything.

03:22.586 --> 03:23.153
You're always talking

03:23.153 --> 03:24.855
about alternate realities and junk like that.

03:24.855 --> 03:25.856
It puts most people to sleep

03:25.856 --> 03:27.424
but those two think you're a god.

03:27.424 --> 03:28.559
In case you haven't noticed,

03:28.559 --> 03:30.861
I don't feel real comfortable around large groups of people.

03:30.861 --> 03:32.496
What do you consider a large group?

03:32.496 --> 03:34.531
Anyone more than me.

03:34.531 --> 03:35.366
(  doorbell rings  )

03:35.366 --> 03:36.367
Come on in.

03:36.367 --> 03:38.135
Money's on the coffee table.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.237
Hello.

03:40.237 --> 03:42.973
Canton Gardens.

03:42.973 --> 03:44.308
(  TV playing  )

03:44.308 --> 03:46.911
I'm stealing all your furniture.

03:51.682 --> 03:52.950
Thank you...

03:52.950 --> 03:54.285
for the lousy tip.

03:55.386 --> 03:58.689
That idiot forgot the fortune cookies.

03:58.689 --> 04:02.626
I did not forget the fortune cookies!

04:02.626 --> 04:03.661
What did you say?

04:03.661 --> 04:05.229
Uh...

04:05.229 --> 04:07.464
meow?

04:07.464 --> 04:08.832
Hey, maybe we should invite Miles

04:08.832 --> 04:10.134
to come to the movies with us.

04:10.134 --> 04:11.135
Do we have to?

04:11.135 --> 04:13.103
We're meeting normal people tonight.

04:13.103 --> 04:14.738
What if I promise he won't use

04:14.738 --> 04:17.207
the words "Roswell," "Bigfoot" or "Klingon"?

04:17.207 --> 04:19.743
We still have to deal with his latest conspiracy theory--

04:19.743 --> 04:23.113
"The moon landing was a total hoax."

04:23.113 --> 04:24.915
Look, I happen to know there's a whole group of people

04:24.915 --> 04:27.785
that are very interested in what Miles thinks

04:27.785 --> 04:31.785
and not just psychiatrists.

04:36.060 --> 04:40.230
Miles: Come in, Sabrina.

04:40.230 --> 04:42.099
Thanks for the secret knock.

04:42.099 --> 04:43.867
Oh, no problem, and don't worry, I wasn't followed.

04:43.867 --> 04:44.635
New toy?

04:44.635 --> 04:47.338
Been saving for this baby since I was 15.

04:47.338 --> 04:49.239
This is the Argonaut XR-9--

04:49.239 --> 04:51.508
eight-inch parabolic primary mirror

04:51.508 --> 04:53.344
800-millimeter focal length

04:53.344 --> 04:55.879
so powerful, pointing it at the moon is like being there

04:55.879 --> 04:57.414
which is a lot more than I can say

04:57.414 --> 04:58.515
for Mr. Neil Armstrong.

04:58.515 --> 04:59.950
Now, how about taking a break

04:59.950 --> 05:01.452
and coming with us to the movies?

05:01.452 --> 05:02.453
No, thanks.

05:02.453 --> 05:03.520
I'm staying in tonight.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.122
Miles, you can't stay in  every  night.

05:05.122 --> 05:07.758
How's everyone going to know what a great guy you are if...

05:07.758 --> 05:10.194
Hey, can you point this thing at the men's weight room?

05:10.194 --> 05:12.196
Ah, apparently you can.

05:12.196 --> 05:13.864
Hello...

05:13.864 --> 05:15.799
The truth is I was thinking about going

05:15.799 --> 05:17.735
to that alternate reality group tonight

05:17.735 --> 05:19.403
but... I feel weird going alone.

05:19.403 --> 05:21.071
Oh, well, Roxie and I'll go with you.

05:21.071 --> 05:23.540
-Really? -Yeah. You know, we can go to the movies anytime

05:23.540 --> 05:24.375
but how many times do you get

05:24.375 --> 05:26.143
to seek out universal truth?

05:26.143 --> 05:28.045
How are you going to get Roxie to come along?

05:28.045 --> 05:31.482
I'm going to lie.

05:31.482 --> 05:32.816
Mmm...

05:32.816 --> 05:35.119
All you have to do is talk for me

05:35.119 --> 05:37.321
and you get the chow mein, mmm?

05:37.321 --> 05:38.489
Mmm...

05:38.489 --> 05:39.490
Pork.

05:39.490 --> 05:40.991
(  whimpering  ): Oh...

05:40.991 --> 05:42.860
the other white meat.

05:42.860 --> 05:43.861
Fine!

05:43.861 --> 05:45.129
I'm talking, see?!

05:45.129 --> 05:46.897
Now give me my chow mein.

05:46.897 --> 05:48.699
I knew I wasn't crazy.

05:48.699 --> 05:50.534
You  are  a talking cat.

05:50.534 --> 05:52.870
You could make me a very wealthy man.

05:52.870 --> 05:54.605
I could quit this stupid job

05:54.605 --> 05:56.440
and move back home to Tokyo.

05:56.440 --> 05:57.775
Hold the phone.

05:57.775 --> 06:01.245
Why's a Japanese guy working in a Chinese restaurant?

06:01.245 --> 06:03.514
Why is a cat talking?

06:03.514 --> 06:07.217
Oh, that's right-- to make me rich.

06:07.217 --> 06:09.053
You're coming with me.

06:09.053 --> 06:13.053
Oh, I knew I should've ordered pizza.

06:14.491 --> 06:16.593
This isn't a movie theater.

06:16.593 --> 06:17.828
You lied to me.

06:17.828 --> 06:19.830
All in the name of truth.

06:19.830 --> 06:21.298
Okay...

06:21.298 --> 06:22.299
I see the Crab Nebula.

06:22.299 --> 06:23.600
I'm starting to feel at home.

06:23.600 --> 06:24.735
And I'm ready to  go  home.

06:24.735 --> 06:27.371
It looks like they're showing a movie in there.

06:29.773 --> 06:31.642
Man: Human cells contain

06:31.642 --> 06:34.311
the very same primordial elements

06:34.311 --> 06:38.816
that compose all heavenly bodies throughout the universe.

06:38.816 --> 06:42.753
We are children of the stars.

06:42.753 --> 06:45.322
Yes. I've always maintained that.

06:45.322 --> 06:48.792
Join me, Jim Tom, on an epic journey

06:48.792 --> 06:52.792
to meet your mortal challenge and discover your cosmic soul.

06:54.665 --> 06:57.334
Or better yet, your cosmic  Soul Train.

06:57.334 --> 06:59.236
Anyone feel like dancing?

06:59.236 --> 07:01.238
Miles, I am so glad you made it.

07:01.238 --> 07:03.173
Hey, Catherine, how's it going?

07:03.173 --> 07:04.541
You remember Sabrina?

07:04.541 --> 07:06.643
Philosophy class... girl in the front row...

07:06.643 --> 07:08.445
sees chairs that aren't really there.

07:08.445 --> 07:09.680
Doesn't ring a bell.

07:09.680 --> 07:10.481
And this is...

07:10.481 --> 07:11.615
Ida.

07:11.615 --> 07:13.517
Ida rather be anywhere else than here.

07:13.517 --> 07:15.219
What did you think of the video?

07:15.219 --> 07:18.789
I just caught the end, but it seemed to completely parallel my world view.

07:18.789 --> 07:20.524
Jim Tom is a brilliant thinker

07:20.524 --> 07:22.826
and we told him how insightful you are.

07:22.826 --> 07:24.194
He was very impressed.

07:24.194 --> 07:24.928
With me?

07:24.928 --> 07:25.929
Oh, yes.

07:25.929 --> 07:28.398
Come and meet some of the others.

07:28.398 --> 07:30.434
How perfect are they together?

07:30.434 --> 07:31.869
Roxie: It's like someone took Ken and Barbie

07:31.869 --> 07:33.670
and dunked them in the freak machine.

07:33.670 --> 07:34.905
What's with you, Roxie?

07:34.905 --> 07:36.507
I mean, maybe these people aren't exactly like us

07:36.507 --> 07:38.342
but that doesn't make them freaks.

07:38.342 --> 07:39.343
Man: Greetings.

07:39.343 --> 07:41.044
My Jim Tom crystal was picking up

07:41.044 --> 07:42.746
powerful vibrations from you.

07:42.746 --> 07:44.548
Permission to touch your aura?

07:44.548 --> 07:46.216
Uh, let's just be friends.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.417
I'm Sabrina and this is...

07:47.417 --> 07:49.419
Someone who was told she was going to the movies.

07:49.419 --> 07:50.754
And you are?

07:50.754 --> 07:53.090
Name's Chuck, but names aren't important here.

07:53.090 --> 07:56.326
What counts is on the inside.

07:56.326 --> 07:58.829
Don't worry, I have pepper spray in my bag.

07:58.829 --> 08:01.265
So, what's the deal with this Jim Tom guy?

08:01.265 --> 08:02.766
Does he have an uncle in the pillow business?

08:02.766 --> 08:04.168
Oh, Jim Tom feels

08:04.168 --> 08:06.470
that the closer we are to Earth

08:06.470 --> 08:08.839
them more freely we can absorb its knowledge.

08:08.839 --> 08:10.407
Oh, so you learn through your butt?

08:10.407 --> 08:11.408
(  laughing  )

08:11.408 --> 08:13.911
Yeah, Jim Tom appreciates humor.

08:13.911 --> 08:16.547
He's an open, nurturing man.

08:16.547 --> 08:18.815
All he asks is that we-we maintain

08:18.815 --> 08:22.152
a respectful distance from... his forbidden zone.

08:22.152 --> 08:23.187
Both: Excuse me?

08:23.187 --> 08:24.421
That.

08:24.421 --> 08:25.822
It's his inner space.

08:25.822 --> 08:27.858
It leads to a place of mystery

08:27.858 --> 08:29.560
a place of magic.

08:29.560 --> 08:30.360
I'm ready for that movie.

08:30.360 --> 08:34.998
-How about you? -Absolutely.

08:34.998 --> 08:36.166
About time!

08:36.166 --> 08:37.501
Where were you?

08:37.501 --> 08:39.903
Leaving messages for every talent agency

08:39.903 --> 08:41.572
from here to Hollywood sign.

08:41.572 --> 08:44.675
You are going to make me filthy rich.

08:44.675 --> 08:46.743
You'll headline in Vegas

08:46.743 --> 08:48.912
and have your own TV show

08:48.912 --> 08:52.416
where you dispense  justice  with  attitude!

08:52.416 --> 08:54.551
Your little moneymaking scheme is over.

08:54.551 --> 08:56.520
At any moment, my friends are going

08:56.520 --> 08:57.354
to crash through that curtain

08:57.354 --> 08:58.555
to rescue me.

08:58.555 --> 09:01.792
Just watch.

09:01.792 --> 09:05.495
I took a shot.

09:05.495 --> 09:06.496
Hey, Rox.

09:06.496 --> 09:07.564
Hey, Miles wasn't

09:07.564 --> 09:08.832
in Philosophy today.

09:08.832 --> 09:10.000
Have you seen him?

09:10.000 --> 09:11.535
He came in after you left for class

09:11.535 --> 09:13.837
changed clothes and headed back to Jim Tom's house.

09:13.837 --> 09:15.639
He's been there three days in a row.

09:15.639 --> 09:17.841
That's what usually happens when you join a cult.

09:17.841 --> 09:19.142
Roxie, it's not a cult.

09:19.142 --> 09:21.011
It's just a... group of lost souls

09:21.011 --> 09:22.279
who worship one guy and don't question

09:22.279 --> 09:24.581
anything he says.

09:24.581 --> 09:28.318
Maybe I should go check on Miles.

09:28.318 --> 09:30.187
Jim Tom changed my life.

09:30.187 --> 09:32.222
Before him (  door closing  )

09:32.222 --> 09:35.192
my life was about material things--

09:35.192 --> 09:37.494
my helicopter, my winery--

09:37.494 --> 09:39.496
but I traded all that

09:39.496 --> 09:43.496
for Jim Tom's gift of enlightenment.

09:47.938 --> 09:51.938
(  chuckling  )

09:53.477 --> 09:54.678
Oh, Lordy.

09:54.678 --> 09:55.646
Oh, brother.

09:55.646 --> 09:57.180
Miles, step away from the little man

09:57.180 --> 09:58.181
and come with me.

09:58.181 --> 09:59.850
Hey, Sabrina, what are you doing here?

09:59.850 --> 10:02.052
I'm a little worried. I haven't seen you in a few days.

10:02.052 --> 10:03.120
I'm doing great.

10:03.120 --> 10:05.489
I'm meeting wonderful, intelligent people

10:05.489 --> 10:07.724
and I'm learning so much from Jim Tom.

10:07.724 --> 10:09.660
He has incredible powers.

10:09.660 --> 10:10.961
Well, so did Spiderman

10:10.961 --> 10:13.297
but he didn't ask people to give up their helicopters.

10:13.297 --> 10:14.398
No, real stuff.

10:14.398 --> 10:16.333
He has the psychic ability

10:16.333 --> 10:19.102
to communicate with plants and insects

10:19.102 --> 10:20.404
and also--

10:20.404 --> 10:22.639
usually you have to be a full-fledged traveler

10:22.639 --> 10:25.776
before you hear this-- he's a witch.

10:25.776 --> 10:26.810
A what?

10:26.810 --> 10:27.978
Tom: A witch.

10:27.978 --> 10:29.513
I don't believe we've met.

10:29.513 --> 10:30.881
This is Sabrina.

10:30.881 --> 10:32.683
Sabrina, I'm Jim Tom.

10:32.683 --> 10:36.019
Glad to have you aboard on this  special  journey.

10:40.490 --> 10:43.551
Welcome, traveler.

10:45.000 --> 10:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:53.068 --> 10:55.337
Miles, do you really believe that Jim Tom is a witch?

10:55.337 --> 10:58.840
I know it sounds weird, but I've seen the man do amazing things--

10:58.840 --> 11:01.109
appear out of thin air, make stuff vanish.

11:01.109 --> 11:02.444
But witches aren't supposed to go around

11:02.444 --> 11:04.145
announcing they're witches.

11:04.145 --> 11:06.047
And you would know that... how?

11:06.047 --> 11:08.016
Well... if I was a witch

11:08.016 --> 11:09.851
you know, I-I... I would...

11:09.851 --> 11:12.787
I wouldn't be blabbing it all over town.

11:13.555 --> 11:16.625
Look at that. Don't you wish you could levitate?

11:16.625 --> 11:17.993
Interesting technique.

11:17.993 --> 11:19.461
Got to go.

11:24.065 --> 11:28.065
Then the hooker says, "Pi to the sixth quadrant."

11:28.436 --> 11:29.704
(  cheering  )

11:29.704 --> 11:31.406
Hi, Aunt Zelda.

11:31.406 --> 11:32.741
Oh. Sabrina.

11:32.741 --> 11:35.310
Who would have guessed that geniuses knew the wave?

11:35.310 --> 11:37.546
Oh, we eggheads love to let it all hang out.

11:37.546 --> 11:39.814
I wish you could have been at Isaac Newton's last night.

11:39.814 --> 11:42.450
The things that man can do with an apple.

11:42.450 --> 11:44.920
Anyway, Aunt Zelda, I just came by to ask you a question.

11:44.920 --> 11:46.821
Have you ever heard of a guy named Jim Tom?

11:46.821 --> 11:48.056
No. Who is he?

11:48.056 --> 11:50.325
He's the leader of a cult that Miles just joined.

11:50.325 --> 11:51.726
Why did Miles join a cult?

11:51.726 --> 11:52.861
I told him to.

11:52.861 --> 11:54.729
But that's beside the point.

11:54.729 --> 11:57.332
Anyway, Jim Tom is claiming he's a witch.

11:57.332 --> 11:59.267
Ooh, I'd hate to think one of our own

11:59.267 --> 12:01.069
is using his powers for evil.

12:01.069 --> 12:02.971
(  cheering  )

12:02.971 --> 12:05.607
Well, is there any way for me to tell if he's really a witch?

12:05.607 --> 12:07.642
Well, you'll have to perform the knuckle test.

12:07.642 --> 12:09.411
Oh, of course, the knuckle test.

12:09.411 --> 12:10.946
What's the knuckle test?

12:10.946 --> 12:13.848
You steal a hair from his left pinkie knuckle.

12:13.848 --> 12:16.117
If the hair curls, he's not a witch.

12:16.117 --> 12:17.686
Is there any other way?

12:17.686 --> 12:19.487
Be thankful-- when I was a girl

12:19.487 --> 12:21.489
you had to go in through the nose.

12:21.489 --> 12:22.624
Ew!

12:22.624 --> 12:23.825
(  cheering  )

12:25.994 --> 12:27.896
Oh, so this is the inner space.

12:27.896 --> 12:30.432
I guess the cult business pays pretty well.

12:30.432 --> 12:33.668
I'll join you right after I cleanse my soul.

12:33.668 --> 12:35.804
Time to be a fly on the wall.

12:35.804 --> 12:39.804
(  buzzing  )

12:42.711 --> 12:44.212
Must have garbage.

12:44.212 --> 12:47.315
No. Got to focus.

12:47.315 --> 12:51.319
(  phone ringing  )

12:51.319 --> 12:53.855
Yello. Jim Tom.

12:53.855 --> 12:55.824
Hey, Harry.

12:55.824 --> 12:58.159
Yeah, it's been a  very  fruitful week.

12:58.159 --> 12:59.961
Uh-huh.

12:59.961 --> 13:02.397
I have seen my early retirement package

13:02.397 --> 13:04.532
and his name is Miles Goodman.

13:04.532 --> 13:06.001
Okay, well, we know he's a crook.

13:06.001 --> 13:07.569
Now let's find out if he's a witch.

13:07.569 --> 13:09.437
Hey, how about you and I taking a cruise

13:09.437 --> 13:11.406
down to the Bahamas for a little R and R?

13:11.406 --> 13:12.741
Ow!

13:12.741 --> 13:15.143
(  buzzing  )

13:15.143 --> 13:18.446
It's official-- he's not a witch.

13:18.446 --> 13:21.549
And he's got eczema.

13:21.549 --> 13:22.751
Uh-oh.

13:22.751 --> 13:24.986
Got to fly.

13:24.986 --> 13:26.755
Darn!

13:28.757 --> 13:32.757
Huh. Close call.

13:33.361 --> 13:38.133
Whoo! That would have been a nightmare to shave.

13:38.133 --> 13:39.401
Oh, hi, Chuck.

13:39.401 --> 13:41.870
Sorry to rain on your psychic parade

13:41.870 --> 13:43.104
but have you seen Miles?

13:43.104 --> 13:45.674
He went home to get something for Jim Tom.

13:45.674 --> 13:47.709
Well, what are you people eating?

13:47.709 --> 13:49.244
Mung beans and rice.

13:49.244 --> 13:50.345
Woman: Jim Tom said

13:50.345 --> 13:51.780
that pure living starts

13:51.780 --> 13:53.581
with a strict vegetarian diet.

13:53.581 --> 13:56.584
So he's a witch  and  a nutritionist?

13:57.585 --> 13:58.887
All: Greetings, traveler!

13:58.887 --> 14:02.791
Oh, greetings... fellow travelers.

14:02.791 --> 14:04.192
Sabrina, you're back.

14:04.192 --> 14:07.095
Yeah. Who could miss "mung beans and rice" night?

14:07.095 --> 14:08.630
What are you doing with your telescope?

14:08.630 --> 14:10.265
Sabrina, it's not my telescope

14:10.265 --> 14:11.966
any more than this is my planet

14:11.966 --> 14:13.735
or these are my hands.

14:13.735 --> 14:17.005
Jim Tom tells us possession should not take over our lives.

14:17.005 --> 14:21.005
The Jim Tom Teachings.  Chapter seven, verse 12-- travelers?

14:21.543 --> 14:24.045
All: "You've got enough; give up your stuff."

14:24.045 --> 14:26.181
That's it? Those are his pearls of wisdom?

14:26.181 --> 14:27.849
Look, Miles, everyone...

14:27.849 --> 14:29.784
Okay, I've got something to tell you

14:29.784 --> 14:31.486
and I'll try to be delicate.

14:31.486 --> 14:33.555
Jim Tom is a big fat liar.

14:33.555 --> 14:35.090
He's a fake, a phony, a con

14:35.090 --> 14:37.826
a cheater, a chiseler, a bamboozler, a swindler...

14:37.826 --> 14:40.528
-He's bunco, bogus... -Sabrina, stop.

14:40.528 --> 14:43.498
Jim Tom already warned us our friends would say that about him.

14:43.498 --> 14:45.366
Because it's true-- I overheard him talking

14:45.366 --> 14:46.601
in his stupid inner space.

14:46.601 --> 14:48.436
Easy there-- we don't go around

14:48.436 --> 14:52.073
insulting  your  forbidden zone.

14:52.073 --> 14:54.342
Jim Tom is planning to take all your money.

14:54.342 --> 14:55.677
That's ridiculous.

14:55.677 --> 14:58.446
All Jim Tom is trying to do is give us a better life

14:58.446 --> 15:00.281
and lead us to true happiness.

15:00.281 --> 15:01.516
But you were happy before.

15:01.516 --> 15:03.752
Remember? You were so excited to just look at the moon.

15:03.752 --> 15:06.387
And then you told me to get involved on  this  planet

15:06.387 --> 15:07.956
and now, for the first time in my life

15:07.956 --> 15:10.225
I feel connected with myself, with other people

15:10.225 --> 15:11.426
and with the universe.

15:11.426 --> 15:13.762
Sabrina, thanks to you, I feel whole.

15:13.762 --> 15:17.265
Yeah? Well... get over it.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.135
(  knocking on door  )

15:20.135 --> 15:21.569
Who is it?

15:21.569 --> 15:25.140
Delivery. Canton Gardens.

15:28.376 --> 15:30.612
Hmm, food in one hand; cat in the other.

15:30.612 --> 15:31.813
You give me a discount

15:31.813 --> 15:34.048
or I report you to the health department.

15:34.048 --> 15:36.117
This isn't just any cat.

15:36.117 --> 15:37.318
It's a talking cat.

15:37.318 --> 15:38.753
He's going to make me rich.

15:38.753 --> 15:40.989
Tell him, cat.

15:40.989 --> 15:43.792
I'll get my wallet.

15:47.896 --> 15:49.864
You really irritate me.

15:49.864 --> 15:51.666
You embarrass me, Simon.

15:51.666 --> 15:53.334
The name's Salem, you idiot.

15:53.334 --> 15:55.203
If you're going to hold me hostage

15:55.203 --> 15:57.038
you could at least show me some respect

15:57.038 --> 15:59.174
and call me by my real... meow.

15:59.174 --> 16:02.243
Meow. Aw, geez.

16:02.243 --> 16:03.978
This is a miracle.

16:03.978 --> 16:06.281
A divine sign from a higher power.

16:06.281 --> 16:07.582
I must own it.

16:07.582 --> 16:10.118
I'm not for sale. Make an offer.

16:10.118 --> 16:13.755
$10,000, and that includes the takeout.

16:13.755 --> 16:15.356
Sold.

16:15.356 --> 16:16.624
(  gasps  )

16:16.624 --> 16:18.560
Okay, Chuck, let's go with your argument.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.795
Let's say that anyone who levitates is a witch.

16:20.795 --> 16:22.263
Well, magicians levitate

16:22.263 --> 16:24.599
and David Copperfield is a magician, ergo...

16:24.599 --> 16:26.100
David Copperfield is a witch!

16:26.100 --> 16:28.803
No! No, no, no.

16:28.803 --> 16:30.471
Okay, let's start again.

16:30.471 --> 16:32.674
Okay, if a person pulls a rabbit out of a hat

16:32.674 --> 16:34.075
we call this person a...?

16:34.075 --> 16:36.044
-A witch! -No!

16:36.044 --> 16:39.614
Sabrina, I think it would be a good idea if you left now.

16:39.614 --> 16:41.115
(  sighs  )

16:41.115 --> 16:43.284
(  explosion  )

16:43.284 --> 16:47.155
Fellow travelers, I have a special treat for you.

16:47.155 --> 16:48.990
Tonight I have proof

16:48.990 --> 16:50.925
the mortal challenge has been met.

16:50.925 --> 16:54.062
I present to you a genuine cosmic soul

16:54.062 --> 16:56.664
an ancient, gifted prophet who has chosen to visit us

16:56.664 --> 16:58.867
in a unique form.

16:58.867 --> 17:00.435
(  travelers gasping  )

17:00.435 --> 17:01.236
Salem?

17:01.236 --> 17:03.137
Stealthy messenger from beyond

17:03.137 --> 17:05.138
revered by witches and pharaohs

17:05.138 --> 17:08.309
please... share with us your wisdom.

17:08.309 --> 17:10.811
Birds fly, dogs walk, but this cat no longer talks.

17:10.811 --> 17:14.811
Anytime you're ready, cosmic soul.

17:18.219 --> 17:21.923
Anytime now.

17:21.923 --> 17:25.292
Talk amongst yourselves.

17:25.292 --> 17:28.061
I think this little charade proves my point.

17:28.061 --> 17:30.531
Of course the cat's not going to speak.

17:30.531 --> 17:32.634
He's picking up on your negative energy.

17:32.634 --> 17:35.737
A prophet can't reveal himself to a nonbeliever.

17:35.737 --> 17:39.974
Okay, I didn't want to have to resort to this. Look.

17:39.974 --> 17:41.809
Jim Tom: You backstabbing little vermin eater.

17:41.809 --> 17:43.978
I shelled out ten grand for you.

17:43.978 --> 17:46.981
If I tell you to talk, you had better talk.

17:46.981 --> 17:49.284
Those idiots aren't going to keep falling

17:49.284 --> 17:50.885
for that levitation trick.

17:50.885 --> 17:52.086
Idiots?

17:52.086 --> 17:54.289
He can't be talking about  us.

17:54.289 --> 17:56.124
Sure, I can string Chuck along.

17:56.124 --> 17:57.892
He's got oatmeal for brains.

17:57.892 --> 17:59.160
I've got to find a new angle

17:59.160 --> 18:02.764
to keep the rest of those losers sucked in.

18:02.764 --> 18:06.100
Sabrina was right-- Jim Tom is a hoax.

18:06.100 --> 18:09.270
Look, his inner space, it's not a spiritual haven--

18:09.270 --> 18:10.772
it's a bachelor pad.

18:10.772 --> 18:12.740
That's my mobile wet bar.

18:12.740 --> 18:14.609
That's my faux tiger skin.

18:14.609 --> 18:16.311
That's my couch!

18:16.311 --> 18:19.247
He said he was going to donate it to an orphanage.

18:19.247 --> 18:21.950
Which one, Our Lady Of Saint Hefner?

18:21.950 --> 18:24.619
Jim Tom also said we had to become vegetarians.

18:24.619 --> 18:27.388
So why is he eating Mongolian Beef?

18:27.388 --> 18:28.823
Brother! We've been had!

18:28.823 --> 18:31.592
This stinks!

18:31.592 --> 18:33.227
Are you okay?

18:33.227 --> 18:37.227
I can't believe I got conned like this.

18:38.967 --> 18:43.271
(  powerful wind whistling  )

18:43.271 --> 18:45.540
How did you get in here?

18:45.540 --> 18:49.510
Well, if you were a witch, you'd know.

18:49.510 --> 18:52.413
And next time you're going to impersonate one, please

18:52.413 --> 18:53.815
do something original.

18:53.815 --> 18:57.815
(  roaring  )

19:00.121 --> 19:01.456
Everybody's on to you.

19:01.456 --> 19:03.458
All your cosmic travelers have left

19:03.458 --> 19:06.394
because they know what kind of person you really are--

19:06.394 --> 19:08.162
a charlatan and a thief.

19:08.162 --> 19:10.498
You know, you and I could make a lot of money together.

19:10.498 --> 19:11.933
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.

19:11.933 --> 19:13.735
You're out of the cult business, Jim Tom.

19:13.735 --> 19:15.536
But I have no other skills.

19:15.536 --> 19:17.805
(  thunder crashing  )

19:17.805 --> 19:20.174
I'll get some.

19:24.846 --> 19:28.216
Tail of rat, wing of bat, allow this cat to chit and chat.

19:28.216 --> 19:32.020
Oh! Sabrina, you saved my life!

19:32.020 --> 19:33.654
Jim Tom said he was going to do

19:33.654 --> 19:35.757
unspeakable things to me if I didn't talk.

19:35.757 --> 19:38.659
(  sobbing  ): He... he...

19:38.659 --> 19:42.659
(  stops sobbing  ): He took the Mongolian beef!

19:43.498 --> 19:45.333
Hey.

19:45.333 --> 19:46.801
Hey, Miles.

19:46.801 --> 19:48.703
Oh, you got back my telescope.

19:48.703 --> 19:51.072
-Thanks, Sabrina. -No problem.

19:51.072 --> 19:53.341
I'm sorry I pushed you to get involved with Jim Tom.

19:53.341 --> 19:55.076
You didn't force me to join that group.

19:55.076 --> 19:56.544
And it wasn't all bad.

19:56.544 --> 19:59.247
I might have temporarily lost my mind, but...

19:59.247 --> 20:00.815
I gained a few friends.

20:00.815 --> 20:01.616
Really?

20:01.616 --> 20:03.317
Yeah. After we left Jim Tom's

20:03.317 --> 20:06.320
all the ex-travelers went out for chicken and waffles.

20:06.320 --> 20:08.456
Well, at least it's better than mung beans.

20:08.456 --> 20:11.325
Sabrina, I've got to tell you, the way you went in there

20:11.325 --> 20:15.430
and put yourself on the line for me was... incredible.

20:15.430 --> 20:16.731
You're a really good friend.

20:16.731 --> 20:18.199
Thanks, Miles.

20:18.199 --> 20:20.835
And if you ever get involved with people

20:20.835 --> 20:23.104
who claim to be from another realm

20:23.104 --> 20:25.506
I'll be the first to bust the thing wide open.

20:25.506 --> 20:29.506
Hopefully, you won't have to go in through the nose.

20:30.711 --> 20:32.113
Private joke.

20:38.653 --> 20:39.854
Zelda: I'm back.

20:39.854 --> 20:43.624
Oh! Sabrina please don't tell Zelda what happened.

20:43.624 --> 20:45.426
She'll never let me stay alone again.

20:45.426 --> 20:47.662
Exactly, she'll make you stay with me-- my lips are sealed.

20:47.662 --> 20:48.930
Hey.

20:48.930 --> 20:50.865
Hey. So how was the rest of genius camp?

20:50.865 --> 20:53.401
Well... Da Vinci was a dream

20:53.401 --> 20:54.769
Kierkegaard was a lech

20:54.769 --> 20:58.072
and Einstein short-sheeted my bed.

20:58.072 --> 20:59.907
How was your weekend, Salem?

20:59.907 --> 21:02.510
Very quiet, nothing out of the ordinary.

21:02.510 --> 21:04.045
-Right, Sabrina? -Right.

21:04.045 --> 21:06.247
(  doorbell rings  ) Pizza guy. I'll get the money.

21:06.247 --> 21:07.915
Oh. I'll get the door.

21:12.920 --> 21:14.489
That'll be $18.50.

21:14.489 --> 21:17.258
Just put it right over there.

21:19.427 --> 21:20.261
(  growls  )

21:20.261 --> 21:22.063
You!

21:22.063 --> 21:22.763
You!

21:22.763 --> 21:24.832
You!

21:24.832 --> 21:25.666
No charge.
