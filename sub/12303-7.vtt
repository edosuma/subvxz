WEBVTT

01:00.534 --> 01:02.867
It looks like it's coming
straight at us.

01:02.934 --> 01:04.134
No.

01:09.434 --> 01:10.534
Is it?

01:10.600 --> 01:12.301
<i>Is it?!</i>

01:12.367 --> 01:14.501
It's on fire.
Dude, swerve...!

02:06.800 --> 02:08.101
Are you okay?

02:08.167 --> 02:09.366
I am.

02:09.434 --> 02:11.401
I think my copilot needs
some help, though.

02:14.667 --> 02:16.934
Sure, yeah.
Anything.

02:23.134 --> 02:25.134
Are those handcuffs?

02:30.667 --> 02:31.934
Oh, my God.

02:34.600 --> 02:36.034
Don't, don't.
Please don't.

02:36.101 --> 02:37.468
Make it worth my while.

02:37.534 --> 02:38.867
I'll do anything you say.

02:38.934 --> 02:41.633
Oh, you say that now.

02:41.700 --> 02:44.067
Get in the car.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.301
Copilot dead, too, Frank?

03:07.367 --> 03:09.301
Yeah, he's inside.

03:09.367 --> 03:11.401
He's got the Marshal's gun.

03:11.468 --> 03:12.867
Pilot radioed a Mayday.

03:12.934 --> 03:14.234
Controller couldn't understand
what he was saying.

03:14.301 --> 03:16.800
Frank, this plane was sabotaged.

03:16.867 --> 03:18.733
Witnesses saw smoke
a mile away.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.568
This is gonna fall
on the Chief.

03:20.633 --> 03:22.934
He's the one who approved
Henry Darius flying

03:23.000 --> 03:25.733
down to Miami to find the body
of Lydia Johnson.

03:25.800 --> 03:28.834
Against my wishes.

03:28.900 --> 03:30.834
Kids' parents say,

03:30.900 --> 03:33.034
they, uh, drove a yellow
convertible Mustang.

03:33.101 --> 03:34.434
I'll put out
a broadcast.

03:34.501 --> 03:36.468
Darius and a convict
to be named later.

03:36.534 --> 03:38.201
Armed and dangerous, Frank.

03:38.267 --> 03:40.167
* Yeah! *

04:01.234 --> 04:04.501
* We don't get fooled again *

04:04.568 --> 04:08.201
* Don't get fooled again *

04:08.267 --> 04:10.267
* No, no. *

04:37.173 --> 04:39.307
Floor panel's gone.

04:40.841 --> 04:45.008
All of these wires are
the electrical switch assembly.

04:45.073 --> 04:46.974
Insulations ripped off
that pipe.

04:47.040 --> 04:48.641
Looks like a
coolant duct.

04:49.507 --> 04:50.641
So, somebody
punctured it.

04:50.708 --> 04:53.007
DELKO:
Yeah. That puncture released

04:53.074 --> 04:54.407
hot gas, so I bet...

04:54.474 --> 04:56.674
I bet our guy has burns
on his hands.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.541
That pipe right there--

05:09.608 --> 05:11.174
that pipe contains hot,
bleed air.

05:11.241 --> 05:12.640
Keeps it away
from the engines.

05:12.707 --> 05:14.640
When he punctured the pipe,
it caused a slow leak,

05:14.707 --> 05:16.474
and that raised the temperature
of the engine.

05:16.541 --> 05:18.608
And caused an emergency landing.

05:18.673 --> 05:19.940
Come on. Let's look
for the black box.

05:20.007 --> 05:21.141
Right.

05:22.940 --> 05:24.407
Notified New York.

05:24.474 --> 05:25.608
Appreciate it.

05:25.673 --> 05:27.474
Detective Taylor sends
his regards,

05:27.541 --> 05:28.940
offers his services.

05:29.007 --> 05:30.241
Mac's a good man.

05:30.307 --> 05:31.474
I figured you'd say that.

05:31.541 --> 05:32.740
I'll tell him
to come down.

05:32.807 --> 05:33.940
We need everybody

05:34.007 --> 05:35.673
that Darius dealt with
at Attica, okay?

05:35.740 --> 05:37.174
I'll tell him.

05:37.241 --> 05:39.374
Thank you.

05:41.874 --> 05:44.807
I waited till the kid got out
of the car.

05:44.874 --> 05:47.508
He was about six,
seven years old.

05:47.574 --> 05:48.740
MAN:
Mrs. Johnson's son.

05:48.807 --> 05:50.374
What did you do
after that?

05:50.441 --> 05:52.541
I got in the car
and held a gun to her head.

05:52.608 --> 05:54.640
Scream and I'll blow
your head off.

05:56.807 --> 05:58.207
And I'll do the same
to your little boy.

05:59.840 --> 06:02.773
She was fighting, screaming,

06:02.840 --> 06:04.840
so I took care of it.

06:04.907 --> 06:06.773
Took care of it how?

06:06.840 --> 06:08.807
Shot her.

06:08.874 --> 06:12.007
She didn't make a peep
after that.

06:12.074 --> 06:13.974
MAN:
I'm gonna ask you again.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.673
Where did you
bury her body?

06:15.740 --> 06:17.673
Now, you dig deeper than that.

06:17.740 --> 06:19.673
And there's no reason for you
to take me all the way

06:19.740 --> 06:22.740
from New York to Miami
to show you her body, is there?

06:22.807 --> 06:26.341
Miami-Dade's not putting you
on a plane without something.

06:30.740 --> 06:33.174
She had on a pearl Rolex.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.707
A fake pearl Rolex.

06:40.608 --> 06:41.874
Mr. Johnson.

06:41.940 --> 06:43.541
Lieutenant,
I own the largest

06:43.608 --> 06:46.007
conglomerate of radio stations
in Florida,

06:46.074 --> 06:47.374
so, of course,
I heard the news,

06:47.441 --> 06:49.608
but I would have appreciated
a phone call.

06:49.673 --> 06:51.608
Sir, I understand,
and I'm sorry

06:51.673 --> 06:53.007
you had to find
out like this.

06:53.074 --> 06:55.673
So, you guys found the guy
who kied my wife,

06:55.740 --> 06:57.341
and you let him get away?

06:57.407 --> 06:58.940
Mr. Johnson,
it's possible

06:59.007 --> 07:00.874
that Darius did
not kill your wife.

07:00.940 --> 07:03.541
Then why did you bring him down
here from a New York prison?

07:03.608 --> 07:07.374
To provide us with
information about
where she's buried.

07:07.441 --> 07:09.174
I said it a year ago,

07:09.241 --> 07:11.207
and I'm still holding out hope
that Lydia's alive.

07:11.274 --> 07:13.207
I understand, but with
the amount of blood

07:13.274 --> 07:14.840
that we recovered
from her vehicle,

07:14.907 --> 07:16.374
I think that's unlikely.

07:20.374 --> 07:21.874
My son...

07:21.940 --> 07:24.574
still waits
for his mother

07:24.640 --> 07:25.874
to come home.

07:25.940 --> 07:29.307
He won't let me turn out
the porch light.

07:31.608 --> 07:35.374
If we could have some closure,
it'd help.

07:35.441 --> 07:38.341
Mr. Johnson, I am going to do
everything in my power

07:38.407 --> 07:41.207
to find your wife, okay?

07:41.274 --> 07:44.307
Thank you.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.807
What are we
looking for?

07:55.874 --> 07:57.241
I don't know yet.

07:57.307 --> 07:58.407
Shot her.

07:58.474 --> 08:00.174
Let me ask you again.

08:00.241 --> 08:01.341
Where did you bury her body?

08:01.407 --> 08:02.874
Dead eyes.

08:02.940 --> 08:05.141
It's the scariest kind
of criminal.

08:06.807 --> 08:09.707
Mr. Hoberman helped me.

08:09.773 --> 08:11.407
Now, you dig deeper than that...

08:11.474 --> 08:12.940
Interesting.

08:13.007 --> 08:14.107
What?

08:14.174 --> 08:15.474
Mr. Hoberman helped me.

08:15.541 --> 08:16.840
Mr. Hoberman
helped me.

08:16.907 --> 08:19.574
Mr. Hoberman helped me.

08:19.640 --> 08:22.407
Did you look into the files
on Darius?

08:22.474 --> 08:24.141
Homicide did.

08:24.207 --> 08:26.141
They looked at the files here
and in New York,

08:26.207 --> 08:27.740
but there's no mention
of a Hoberman.

08:27.807 --> 08:29.341
Now, you dip deeper...

08:29.407 --> 08:30.874
Now, you
dig deeper...

08:30.940 --> 08:33.307
Now, you dig deeper...

08:34.341 --> 08:35.508
Dig deeper.

08:35.573 --> 08:36.607
He's playing with us.

08:36.673 --> 08:38.307
He's playing how?

08:38.374 --> 08:39.940
I don't know.

08:40.006 --> 08:41.341
Let's pull up all the newspapers

08:41.407 --> 08:43.307
surrounding the day
Mrs. Johnson went missing.

08:47.174 --> 08:50.007
Got an ad here
for new condos on Collins.

08:50.074 --> 08:52.807
Digging begins winter of '06.

08:52.874 --> 08:54.508
No Hoberman.

08:54.574 --> 08:57.707
I go an archeological dig
up in St. Augustine.

08:57.773 --> 08:59.474
Any mention of Hoberman?

08:59.541 --> 09:01.474
No.

09:18.074 --> 09:21.107
Got an ad here
for Hobie boards.

09:21.174 --> 09:22.673
Maybe it's a
bastardization
of Hoberman.

09:22.740 --> 09:24.040
Calleigh.

09:24.107 --> 09:24.673
It could happen.

09:24.740 --> 09:25.307
Cal.

09:25.374 --> 09:26.007
What?

09:26.074 --> 09:27.474
Obituaries.

09:27.541 --> 09:30.707
Atticus Hoberman,
died October 31, 2004.

09:30.773 --> 09:32.807
That's the day before
Lydia Johnson went missing.

09:32.874 --> 09:34.374
But he was interred

09:34.441 --> 09:36.040
November 2.

09:36.107 --> 09:39.074
That was the day after
she went missing.

09:39.141 --> 09:40.341
"Dig deep."

09:40.407 --> 09:41.541
Does it say what cemetery?

09:41.608 --> 09:44.407
Yeah. Montefiore Acres,
Surfglide Way.

09:44.474 --> 09:46.074
We're gonna need a warrant.

09:46.141 --> 09:48.241
And some heavy equipment.

10:01.974 --> 10:05.241
WOODS:
Coffin's wood.

10:05.307 --> 10:07.574
Still looks new.

10:07.640 --> 10:10.274
Let's see
if Lydia Johnson's inside.

10:13.974 --> 10:16.374
According to the file,
Mr. Hoberman died peacefully

10:16.441 --> 10:18.107
of natural causes.

10:18.174 --> 10:21.773
Everything looks consistent.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.040
No Lydia.

10:25.107 --> 10:26.307
She's not
under him?

10:26.374 --> 10:27.874
Not in this casket.

10:27.940 --> 10:30.040
He's in here alone.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.341
Guys.

10:36.207 --> 10:39.040
It's a shovel.

10:39.107 --> 10:41.441
It was under the coffin.

10:47.007 --> 10:48.307
"Dig deeper."

10:48.374 --> 10:50.074
That's cement
under your feet.

10:50.141 --> 10:51.740
Crypts are set the day before.

10:51.807 --> 10:53.740
So, Lydia couldn't
be buried here.

10:53.807 --> 10:55.608
Well, she had
to be buried somewhere,

10:55.673 --> 10:56.773
and there's blood
on the shovel.

10:56.840 --> 10:57.773
Bet if we test it,

10:57.840 --> 10:59.508
it's hers.

10:59.574 --> 11:02.007
Your Darius is one tricky guy.

11:02.074 --> 11:03.640
Looked in the paper for burials,

11:03.707 --> 11:05.474
showed up before the ceremony,

11:05.541 --> 11:09.074
put the shovel
in a stranger's
freshly dug grave.

11:09.141 --> 11:10.541
Where no one would ever think
to look.

11:10.608 --> 11:11.773
WOLFE:
You know,
the funny thing is,

11:11.840 --> 11:13.207
by burying the shovel
in the crypt,

11:13.274 --> 11:16.374
he may have preserved
the evidence.

11:22.907 --> 11:25.274
Eric.

11:25.341 --> 11:26.673
The black box.

11:26.740 --> 11:28.673
I got it, but the feds
swooped in and took it.

11:28.740 --> 11:29.974
I did get the pilot's

11:30.040 --> 11:31.840
transcripts, though.
Okay, that's
good enough.

11:31.907 --> 11:33.874
He told Miami International
he was diverting to Opa-Locka.

11:33.940 --> 11:35.274
There was a lot of stress
in his voice.

11:35.341 --> 11:39.374
Wait a second...
diverting to Opa-Locka Airport?

11:39.441 --> 11:41.174
Yeah, then mechanical problems
brought him down

11:41.241 --> 11:42.874
a couple of miles short--
he crash landed.

11:45.174 --> 11:46.474
What are you thinking?

11:46.541 --> 11:48.673
Somebody may still be waiting
for him, Eric.

11:48.740 --> 11:50.407
All right, I'll tell Tripp.

11:50.474 --> 11:53.508
Have him
meet me there.

12:05.740 --> 12:08.541
CAINE:
He's not gonna make it, ma'am.

12:08.608 --> 12:09.907
Excuse me?

12:09.974 --> 12:12.608
Henry Darius.

12:12.673 --> 12:14.074
He's not gonna show.

12:14.141 --> 12:16.407
I don't know
who you're talking about.

12:16.474 --> 12:18.174
Ma'am, we have a list

12:18.241 --> 12:19.707
of h pen pals
from Attica.

12:19.773 --> 12:21.241
Prisoners troll the Internet.

12:21.307 --> 12:23.241
Freedom of speech b.s.

12:23.307 --> 12:25.274
And those lowlifes
reel in women like you.

12:25.341 --> 12:26.874
CAINE:
Women that fall in love

12:26.940 --> 12:28.007
with serial killers.

12:28.074 --> 12:31.640
Henry and I did correspond.

12:31.707 --> 12:34.441
He's very nice,
thoughtful, and caring,

12:34.508 --> 12:35.840
exceptionally intelligent.

12:35.907 --> 12:38.040
So you thought you'd spring him
from prison.

12:38.107 --> 12:40.241
He diverts a plane,
you're here to whisk him away

12:40.307 --> 12:41.541
to your villa,
is that right?

12:41.608 --> 12:43.241
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

12:43.307 --> 12:44.974
Then you won't mind us
checking that bag.

12:50.907 --> 12:52.608
Looks like about 20 large.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.541
It's mine.
CAINE:
Ma'am, if I were

12:57.608 --> 13:00.640
to guess, I would say that's
expense money for Mr. Darius.

13:00.707 --> 13:02.773
Ah. Well, you prove that.

13:02.840 --> 13:04.807
You can reach me
on Hibiscus Island.

13:06.874 --> 13:08.107
All right.

13:08.174 --> 13:11.508
Found the car--
57th and Flagler.

13:11.574 --> 13:13.074
One male driver.

13:13.141 --> 13:14.707
Tell them to use the pulse--
I'll meet them there.

13:14.773 --> 13:16.474
Ma'am, don't leave town.

13:44.241 --> 13:46.508
That's far enough,
gentlemen.

13:46.574 --> 13:47.740
Where's Darius, Ken?

13:47.807 --> 13:49.107
KEN:
I don't know.

13:49.174 --> 13:50.807
Who brought the plane down,
you or him?

13:50.874 --> 13:52.207
I didn't want any part of this.

13:52.274 --> 13:54.241
I was supposed to stand trial
in a fraud case.

13:54.307 --> 13:55.840
I'm strictly
white collar.

13:55.907 --> 13:58.274
So it was you--
hat's a gas burn on your arm.

13:58.341 --> 13:59.807
Darius said he'd let me go.

13:59.874 --> 14:02.141
As soon as you got
to Opa-Locka.

14:04.673 --> 14:07.508
You should probably go
to the bathroom now..

14:14.341 --> 14:15.608
Timed it wrong.

14:15.673 --> 14:17.007
We fell short.

14:17.074 --> 14:18.541
I notice that blood
on your pants, Ken.

14:18.608 --> 14:19.574
What's that from?

14:21.574 --> 14:23.107
The plane crash.

14:23.174 --> 14:24.407
No, it's not.

14:24.474 --> 14:25.608
What did you guys do?

14:25.673 --> 14:27.474
I didn't do anything, I ran.

14:27.541 --> 14:28.640
Ken...

14:28.707 --> 14:30.040
Did Darius just kill someone?

14:33.773 --> 14:35.341
Did he just kill someone?

14:35.407 --> 14:37.773
I want a location
right now.

14:37.840 --> 14:39.840
Miami U building, at
the edge of campus.

14:39.907 --> 14:41.007
Theta Gamma something.

14:41.074 --> 14:44.040
You don't
understand.

14:46.074 --> 14:48.374
Look in that guy's
eyes, it's too late.

14:48.441 --> 14:49.840
For you, too.

15:06.640 --> 15:09.241
Looks like the girls
tried to fight him off.

15:12.474 --> 15:14.773
Yes, it does.

15:14.840 --> 15:18.274
You think a guy like Darius
can stop on his own, Horatio?

15:18.341 --> 15:21.940
He's not gonna stop
until we make him stop.

16:38.247 --> 16:42.181
<i>So the blood on the shovel
matches Lydia Johnson,</i>

16:42.247 --> 16:43.914
but Darius did
not bury Lydia.

16:43.981 --> 16:45.147
Then how'd he get
specific information?

16:45.214 --> 16:46.947
Did he have a partner,
did he hear it

16:47.014 --> 16:48.547
through the prison
grapevine?
It's not his MO.

16:48.613 --> 16:50.513
How about the soil on
the shovel-- did it help?

16:50.580 --> 16:52.414
Depends how you
look at it-- it's marl soil.

16:52.513 --> 16:54.847
Marl soil, calcium from
the summer wet season.

16:54.914 --> 16:57.281
Right, means she was buried in
low-lying land in Dade County.

16:57.348 --> 16:58.580
Still, it's
a large area.

16:58.647 --> 17:00.680
Okay, stay on it,
Mr. Wolfe, stay on it.

17:18.814 --> 17:22.747
Young girls just hanging out
watching soaps,

17:22.814 --> 17:25.680
not expecting to have
to confront a killer.

17:25.747 --> 17:28.480
No one ever does.

17:28.547 --> 17:31.580
Life and death at 18.

17:31.647 --> 17:33.847
Shame.

17:38.580 --> 17:40.580
These blood stains
seem out of place.

17:42.513 --> 17:44.114
Where you going?

17:47.014 --> 17:48.947
Alexx, we've
got a live one!

17:49.014 --> 17:50.247
DUQUESNE:
You're okay,
you're gonna be okay.

17:50.314 --> 17:51.281
You're safe.

17:51.348 --> 17:52.680
We're gonna move you out.

17:55.513 --> 17:56.814
She's almost suffocated.

17:58.047 --> 18:00.480
Rescue to 1818 Mirabella Street.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.448
He... he.

18:02.513 --> 18:03.880
She's going into shock.

18:03.947 --> 18:06.348
It's okay, you're gonna be okay.

18:12.348 --> 18:14.547
CAINE:
Mr. Johnson, I'd like to talk
to your son

18:14.613 --> 18:16.114
about the day
your wife disappeared.

18:16.181 --> 18:17.247
We've been through this.

18:17.314 --> 18:18.780
He didn't see anything.

18:18.847 --> 18:21.281
I understand that,
but if it would be okay,

18:21.348 --> 18:23.114
I'd like to determine that
for myself.

18:23.181 --> 18:24.547
What, a year later?

18:24.613 --> 18:26.214
You see, Mr. Johnson,

18:26.281 --> 18:27.847
sometimes with a trauma
like this,

18:27.914 --> 18:29.947
it can take some time
for it to dissipate.

18:30.014 --> 18:31.613
I'm telling
you, he didn't

18:31.680 --> 18:34.448
see anything.

18:34.513 --> 18:36.381
Fine, let's go.

18:36.448 --> 18:37.513
I meant alone.

18:38.947 --> 18:41.047
If that would be okay.

18:43.081 --> 18:45.047
Yeah.

18:51.947 --> 18:54.047
<i>CAINE:
That's exactly right, Adam,</i>

18:54.114 --> 18:56.847
It's just like the big
shield, only smaller.

18:56.914 --> 18:58.214
I like the way it feels.

18:58.281 --> 18:59.580
Now, Adam,

18:59.647 --> 19:03.348
tell me what's special
about the gold shield.

19:04.381 --> 19:06.247
It has an eagle

19:06.314 --> 19:07.714
on top of it?

19:07.780 --> 19:10.281
It does. You see, now,
you have a good eye.

19:10.348 --> 19:11.348
I do?

19:11.414 --> 19:12.814
You do, son.

19:12.880 --> 19:16.613
Adam, what I want to do
is going to be hard,

19:16.680 --> 19:18.780
but I want to ask
you a few questions

19:18.847 --> 19:20.747
about the day your
mom disappeared.

19:20.814 --> 19:22.647
Could you help
me with that?

19:25.414 --> 19:28.081
Okay, good.

19:29.147 --> 19:30.814
Now, your mom...

19:30.880 --> 19:33.580
your mom drove you
to soccer practice,

19:33.647 --> 19:36.247
and then what happened?

19:36.314 --> 19:37.547
Here's your ball.

19:37.613 --> 19:39.348
Have a good practice.

19:39.414 --> 19:41.147
I'll see you at 5:00.

19:41.214 --> 19:42.680
Scream, and I'll
blow your head off,

19:42.747 --> 19:44.414
and I'll do the same
to your little boy.

19:47.847 --> 19:50.714
I saw a guy in the front seat...

19:50.780 --> 19:54.314
close to my mom... whispering.

19:54.381 --> 19:56.981
He was in the front seat?

19:57.047 --> 20:00.081
Adam, I... I thought you
were in the front seat.

20:00.147 --> 20:03.348
No. Mom never let me
sit in the front.

20:03.414 --> 20:05.081
Air bags.

20:05.147 --> 20:06.747
Air bags.

20:06.814 --> 20:09.981
Okay, and he...
he was whispering.

20:10.047 --> 20:12.181
How could you tell?

20:12.247 --> 20:14.880
'Cause I couldn't hear them.

20:14.947 --> 20:16.747
Wait.

20:16.814 --> 20:20.847
He turned the music up...
crazy loud.

20:23.647 --> 20:25.547
I should have protected her.

20:25.613 --> 20:27.647
I didn't do anything to stop it.

20:27.714 --> 20:30.814
Adam, sometimes the
smartest thing to do

20:30.880 --> 20:32.147
is to do nothing.

20:32.214 --> 20:34.014
Now, what else do you
remember about him?

20:41.814 --> 20:43.680
Hair.

20:43.747 --> 20:47.348
He had long hair,
down his back.

20:47.414 --> 20:51.847
He tied it,
with a rubber band.

20:51.914 --> 20:56.314
Okay, you mean... you
mean like a ponytail?

20:57.847 --> 21:00.348
Like a ponytail.

21:00.414 --> 21:02.480
Adam, that is perfect.

21:03.714 --> 21:06.414
Now, this lady is
our sketch artist.

21:06.480 --> 21:07.847
She's gonna help
you remember

21:07.914 --> 21:09.448
what his face looks
like, all right?

21:09.513 --> 21:10.780
Thanks for the pin.

21:10.847 --> 21:13.047
You bet, partner,
you bet.

21:13.114 --> 21:15.414
Go ahead, ma'am.

21:18.247 --> 21:20.814
We need to go back to
Lydia Johnson's van

21:20.880 --> 21:22.014
and have another look.

21:22.081 --> 21:23.381
Have another look at what?

21:23.448 --> 21:24.847
The killer was
in the front seat.

21:24.914 --> 21:25.981
He may have
touched something.

21:26.047 --> 21:28.914
DELKO:
All right.

21:32.448 --> 21:34.847
Hope you're not allergic
to dust.

21:43.081 --> 21:45.880
This is Lydia Johnson's
mini-van.

22:15.747 --> 22:17.314
Can't print these.

22:19.014 --> 22:20.947
You have the keys, Frank?

22:21.014 --> 22:22.181
Yeah.

22:22.247 --> 22:24.880
Thanks.

22:28.047 --> 22:32.613
Johnson kid said the music
was crazy loud, right?

22:32.680 --> 22:33.947
Yeah, but not on that station.

22:34.014 --> 22:35.281
That's housewife music.

22:44.147 --> 22:47.147
Homemade CD
and a memade label.

22:49.181 --> 22:51.381
The wife's?

22:51.448 --> 22:52.914
No, I don't think so.

22:52.981 --> 22:55.414
Guy's picture's on it,
his address, too.

22:59.014 --> 23:00.613
Fort Lauderdale.
Yeah.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.314
Let's go.

23:15.547 --> 23:18.480
You the, uh, lead singer
or just a solo act?

23:18.547 --> 23:21.348
Who are you?

23:21.414 --> 23:22.914
Miami CSI.

23:22.981 --> 23:26.147
We found a homemade copy of your
CD in a murder victim's vehicle.

23:28.181 --> 23:29.780
I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:29.847 --> 23:31.914
I suppose you don't know
Lydia Johnson, either.

23:31.981 --> 23:33.780
Who?

23:33.847 --> 23:36.014
TRIPP:
Wife of the owner of Florida's
largest media conglomerate,

23:36.081 --> 23:37.780
James Johnson.

23:37.847 --> 23:39.714
Has an eight-year-old son who
saw somebody kill his mom

23:39.780 --> 23:40.981
right in front of him.

23:41.047 --> 23:44.981
I didn't kill anybody,
all right?

23:45.047 --> 23:46.014
I'm no hater.

23:46.081 --> 23:48.214
Fine.

23:48.281 --> 23:51.348
What was your CD doing
inside their minivan?

23:53.381 --> 23:56.714
Why don't you ask Mr. Johnson
about the CD?

23:56.780 --> 23:58.181
I jumped in his car
that morning.

23:58.247 --> 23:59.747
I told him to take a listen.

24:02.014 --> 24:04.847
I don't see
what the big deal is.

24:04.914 --> 24:06.647
On t day
that your wife disappears,

24:06.714 --> 24:08.247
a kid that you don't know

24:08.314 --> 24:11.981
forces his way into your car and
makes you listen to his song.

24:12.047 --> 24:13.613
You don't think
that's a big deal.

24:13.680 --> 24:16.480
You think that's the first kid
to pull a Rupert Pupkin on me?

24:16.547 --> 24:18.214
Pass.

24:18.281 --> 24:19.747
Give it to Mellow 101.

24:19.814 --> 24:21.513
<i>Let them put
their listeners to sleep.</i>

24:21.580 --> 24:23.081
Hey, whoa.

24:23.147 --> 24:24.714
Mr. Johnson,
I'm so sorry about this.

24:26.114 --> 24:27.181
You got to hear this.

24:27.247 --> 24:28.814
This is called "Flyami."
Check it out.

24:39.181 --> 24:42.448
This is the worst song
I have ever heard

24:42.513 --> 24:44.947
in my life.

24:46.414 --> 24:47.613
Here's my card.

24:47.680 --> 24:51.448
en you get some talent,
give me a call.

25:01.147 --> 25:04.414
1,000 of those
Eminem wannabes a month.

25:04.480 --> 25:07.281
Just gave him my card
to get rid of him.
You should have

25:07.348 --> 25:08.747
locked your doors, James.

25:08.814 --> 25:10.981
Well, I would've if I could've
found the auto lock.

25:11.047 --> 25:11.981
It's my wife's car.

25:12.047 --> 25:13.613
We swapped that morning.

25:13.680 --> 25:16.947
You and your wife swapped cars
on the day she disappeared,

25:17.014 --> 25:19.547
and you didn't think it was
important to tell the police.

25:19.613 --> 25:22.647
I didn't think it was important.

25:24.947 --> 25:26.513
You think this guy
has something to do

25:26.580 --> 25:27.647
with Lydia's disappearance.

25:27.714 --> 25:29.680
I mean,
how could I possibly know?

25:29.747 --> 25:31.947
I mean, I'm getting
this information a year later.

25:36.480 --> 25:40.747
When you find out more,
give me a call.

25:40.814 --> 25:42.348
I have your card, James.

25:45.714 --> 25:47.181
But thank you.

25:55.747 --> 25:57.981
Let's go back into
his financial records, please.

25:58.047 --> 25:58.981
Did.

25:59.047 --> 26:00.081
A year ago.

26:00.147 --> 26:01.780
Let's do it again.

26:10.014 --> 26:11.947
Kimberly, the man who
broke into your sorority house,

26:12.014 --> 26:13.814
did he look like this?

26:13.880 --> 26:15.647
His name is Henry Darius.

26:15.714 --> 26:16.814
Yes.

26:16.880 --> 26:18.981
Can you tell me what happened?

26:19.047 --> 26:23.281
Um, I missed the tournament bus.

26:23.348 --> 26:27.780
When I walked into
the house, and, um...

26:27.847 --> 26:29.214
there was blood everywhere.

26:29.281 --> 26:31.348
The girls were still

26:31.414 --> 26:36.381
on the floor, and...
Katie was still moaning.

26:36.448 --> 26:38.480
I tiptoed right past his back.

26:38.547 --> 26:40.814
You did good to hide
in the laundry room.

26:42.547 --> 26:43.780
Did he say anything?

26:43.847 --> 26:45.314
Did he talk to anyone?

26:47.247 --> 26:50.181
Uh... "Where's Alexa?
Where is she?"

26:50.247 --> 26:52.314
Who is Alexa?

26:52.381 --> 26:54.480
Alexa Endecott.

26:54.547 --> 26:55.847
Third year sister.

26:57.580 --> 27:00.181
He kept asking where she was.

27:00.247 --> 27:02.014
Is she in Fort Lauderdale
with the others?

27:02.081 --> 27:03.181
No.

27:03.247 --> 27:04.547
I know she was ditching
the tournament,

27:04.613 --> 27:07.880
but I can't remember what for.

27:09.714 --> 27:11.680
Okay, Kimberly,

27:11.747 --> 27:14.081
I need you to think.

27:14.147 --> 27:17.181
I need you to remember
where she is.

27:19.747 --> 27:21.914
DUQUESNE:
Coco Riding Club.

27:21.981 --> 27:23.814
She went around 11:00 a.m.
this morning.

27:23.880 --> 27:25.047
I know where that is, Calleigh.

27:25.114 --> 27:28.381
Thank you.

27:28.448 --> 27:29.847
Lieutenant Caine.

27:29.914 --> 27:32.181
Detective Mac Taylor.

27:32.247 --> 27:33.547
Could've used a tailwind.

27:33.613 --> 27:34.880
No worries.

27:34.947 --> 27:36.747
Heard Darius had already
hit a sorority house.

27:36.814 --> 27:38.314
Yes, Miami University.

27:38.381 --> 27:40.214
He's looking
for somebody specific, Mac.

27:40.281 --> 27:41.047
Have a name?

27:41.114 --> 27:42.814
Alexa Endecott, 21.

27:42.880 --> 27:44.381
No longer using her cell phone.

27:44.448 --> 27:45.880
We know where she is?
We do.

27:45.947 --> 27:48.014
The bad news, Mac, so does he.

28:19.754 --> 28:22.554
Please explain why I just had
six police officers

28:22.620 --> 28:24.088
barge onto club property.

28:24.154 --> 28:26.320
It's called
a murder investigation.

28:26.387 --> 28:28.320
You're kidding, right?

28:28.387 --> 28:30.054
He's a fugitive from New York.

28:30.121 --> 28:31.587
He's on a killing spree
in Miami.

28:31.654 --> 28:33.088
He's targeting Alexa Endecott.

28:33.154 --> 28:35.587
Is she here?

28:35.654 --> 28:36.821
Uh, she was jumping

28:36.887 --> 28:38.387
steeples earlier, down that way.

28:39.420 --> 28:40.954
Thank you.

28:51.954 --> 28:55.921
Whoa. Whoa.

28:58.721 --> 29:01.188
Whoa.

29:01.253 --> 29:03.487
He's a little spooked.

29:10.787 --> 29:12.554
A.E.

29:12.620 --> 29:13.987
Alexa Endecott.

29:14.054 --> 29:15.554
Take a look at this, Mac.

29:16.887 --> 29:18.620
Blood.

29:18.687 --> 29:20.188
Still wet, too.

29:20.253 --> 29:22.154
That blood is Alexa's.

29:22.220 --> 29:23.821
Lieutenant.

29:23.887 --> 29:24.821
Yeah.

29:24.887 --> 29:26.587
We found something.

29:26.654 --> 29:29.188
OFFICER:
Rescue's on its way.

29:29.253 --> 29:33.554
He's security for the club.

29:33.620 --> 29:35.287
Sir, you okay?

29:35.353 --> 29:36.387
What happened?

29:38.721 --> 29:40.253
We're lookg
for Alexa Endecott.

29:40.320 --> 29:43.253
Guy took my car.

29:43.320 --> 29:44.554
Okay.

29:46.088 --> 29:48.353
Where's your gun?

29:48.420 --> 29:49.353
He-he took it.

29:49.420 --> 29:52.088
Mac.

29:53.754 --> 29:55.220
Yeah, I've got
a police emergency.

29:55.287 --> 29:56.721
Connect me to the security car

29:56.787 --> 29:58.954
assigned to
the Coco Riding Club.

29:59.021 --> 30:00.454
Based on past behavior,

30:00.520 --> 30:02.154
he'll ditch the car
first chance he gets.

30:02.220 --> 30:03.188
We don't have much time.

30:03.253 --> 30:05.387
Yeah.

30:05.454 --> 30:07.387
We're connecting you right now.

30:07.454 --> 30:09.454
Nobody knows him
better than you do, Mac.

30:13.021 --> 30:14.954
Security.

30:15.021 --> 30:16.954
Henry Darius?

30:17.021 --> 30:22.654
Detective Mac Taylor,
all the way from New York City.

30:22.721 --> 30:24.587
Hey, those nurses' apartment,

30:24.654 --> 30:26.787
did you ever get the blood
out of the carpet?

30:28.253 --> 30:32.154
I'm here with Lieutenant
Horatio Caine, Miami-Dade PD.

30:32.220 --> 30:33.687
You had to call for backup.

30:33.754 --> 30:34.987
I'm flattered.

30:35.054 --> 30:37.654
Darius, I want to speak
to Alexa right now.

30:37.721 --> 30:40.887
She can't talk right now.

30:42.721 --> 30:44.088
I've got roadblocks,

30:44.154 --> 30:45.821
and all of Miami is looking
for you, my friend.

30:45.887 --> 30:48.387
Well, I would expect no less.

30:48.454 --> 30:49.887
Car has GPS, we'll find you.

30:49.954 --> 30:53.587
You will find me
when I want you to find me.

30:59.387 --> 31:02.954
Alexa Endecott, the Endecotts?

31:03.021 --> 31:06.121
The Endecotts,
sugar cane and railways.

31:06.188 --> 31:08.021
Philanthropy in every
big city in America.

31:08.088 --> 31:09.687
He picked very rich girl.

31:09.754 --> 31:11.821
OFFICER:
Lieutenant.

31:11.887 --> 31:13.887
GPS kicked out the vehicle.

31:31.854 --> 31:34.854
Officer.

31:34.921 --> 31:35.921
Did you touch anything else?

31:35.987 --> 31:36.921
No.

31:36.987 --> 31:38.021
Just popped the trunk, sir.

31:38.088 --> 31:39.487
Car's empty.

31:39.554 --> 31:41.054
We're gonna have a look.
Sure thing.

31:43.954 --> 31:47.520
Darius disabled the radio,
but not the video camera.

31:47.587 --> 31:50.454
It's a projected image,
no tape inside.

31:50.520 --> 31:53.154
I'll call the security company,
see what they have.

31:53.220 --> 31:55.854
Something else.

31:55.921 --> 31:58.021
What'd you get?

32:02.021 --> 32:03.987
"6601-C6."

32:04.054 --> 32:08.687
Sounds like it could
be map coordinates.

32:10.721 --> 32:13.353
It's not like him
to telegraph where he's going.

32:13.420 --> 32:15.454
Maybe it's where he's been, Mac.

32:17.487 --> 32:20.021
Burial site
for your Lydia Johnson.

32:20.088 --> 32:21.420
That's what I'm thinking.

32:21.487 --> 32:23.154
Why don't I ge
that security video.

32:23.220 --> 32:25.088
Take one of my officers,
if you need one.

32:25.154 --> 32:26.721
<i>( cell phone beeps )</i>

32:26.787 --> 32:27.721
Yeah, Eric.

32:27.787 --> 32:28.954
Run some coordinates, please.

32:29.021 --> 32:31.487
6601-C6.

32:31.554 --> 32:35.520
INE:
Talk to me.

32:35.587 --> 32:37.188
Looks like
a Florida street guide.

32:37.253 --> 32:39.954
Page definitely corresponds
to a location in Dade County.

32:40.021 --> 32:42.088
Yeah, factoring in the soil
evidence from the shovel,

32:42.154 --> 32:44.287
he's pointing us
to a wetlands area in Homestead.

32:44.353 --> 32:46.754
All right, I'll meet you there.

32:49.654 --> 32:51.054
DELKO:
Underground scanning.

32:51.121 --> 32:52.954
What branch of the military
did we get this from?

32:53.021 --> 32:56.454
CAINE:
Technology's not perfected,
but it'll get us there.

32:56.520 --> 32:57.854
What are they listening for?

32:57.921 --> 33:00.154
Lydia Johnson's Rolex
is a fake, Eric.

33:00.220 --> 33:02.353
Meaning it ticks
instead of sweeps.

33:02.420 --> 33:03.587
Good thing her husband
was cheap.

33:03.654 --> 33:04.587
Let's just hope

33:04.654 --> 33:05.921
the battery holds up.

33:07.787 --> 33:09.088
He found something.

33:09.154 --> 33:10.154
Good.

33:57.754 --> 33:58.954
CAINE:
Alexx?

33:59.021 --> 34:00.088
The clothes
and the jewelry

34:00.154 --> 34:01.320
are a match
to Lydia Johnson

34:01.387 --> 34:03.921
I'll take dental records
to be sure.

34:03.987 --> 34:06.454
The family has waited a year.

34:07.320 --> 34:08.320
I'm on it.

34:17.286 --> 34:20.320
Horatio...

34:20.387 --> 34:22.088
a business card.

34:22.154 --> 34:24.387
When you
find out more...

34:30.387 --> 34:31.188
give me a call.

34:33.654 --> 34:35.554
It's the husband's
business card.

34:35.620 --> 34:38.188
Maybe Lydia's pointi us
to her killer.

34:41.454 --> 34:42.786
James, we found
your business card

34:42.853 --> 34:45.253
on your wife's body.

34:45.320 --> 34:47.320
This is my wife.

34:47.387 --> 34:48.387
Was.

34:51.587 --> 34:52.954
I'm just glad you found her.

34:53.021 --> 34:54.887
Yeah, I bet you are.

34:57.754 --> 34:59.687
What is that supposed to mean?

34:59.754 --> 35:01.921
You took out a $5 million
life insurance policy

35:01.987 --> 35:02.921
on your wife.

35:02.987 --> 35:04.253
The way the policy
is designed,

35:04.320 --> 35:07.921
you don't get a penny
until you produce her body.

35:07.987 --> 35:09.253
You also
called the department

35:09.320 --> 35:11.320
every week for a year,
James.

35:11.387 --> 35:14.287
Family fiscal planning.

35:14.353 --> 35:16.954
Nothing more.

35:17.021 --> 35:19.754
Took the policy out
the week our son was born.

35:19.821 --> 35:23.554
Need I remind you that
I found your business card

35:23.620 --> 35:26.587
on your dead wife's body?

35:26.654 --> 35:28.088
Folded in half.

35:28.154 --> 35:29.554
That's how I hand them out.

35:29.620 --> 35:31.088
Must have given it to somebody
who gave it to her.

35:31.154 --> 35:32.954
To who?
Who would that be?

35:33.021 --> 35:34.088
I told you,

35:34.154 --> 35:35.520
I meet hundreds of people
a week,

35:35.587 --> 35:37.787
it could be anyone.

35:37.854 --> 35:39.887
ID'd the print on the card.

35:43.554 --> 35:44.554
Thank you, Eric.

35:47.987 --> 35:49.654
Well, James...

35:51.353 --> 35:53.554
sit tight.

35:53.620 --> 35:55.353
It's about to get interesting.

36:02.554 --> 36:05.354
Brian, right now
I have enough

36:05.420 --> 36:07.021
to charge you
with murder.

36:07.088 --> 36:08.821
I did not kill that lady.

36:08.887 --> 36:10.320
Then how
do you explain

36:10.387 --> 36:14.954
your fingerprint
on that business card
in Lydia's grave?

36:17.020 --> 36:18.454
My God, I-I...

36:18.521 --> 36:20.454
I don't know
how this got so screwed up.

36:20.521 --> 36:22.287
You want some help
with it?

36:24.453 --> 36:26.887
I followed
Mr. Johnson for weeks.

36:26.954 --> 36:29.453
I had his car information,
his schedule,

36:29.520 --> 36:30.887
everything about him.

36:30.954 --> 36:32.554
And then he refused
to help you with your music?

36:32.620 --> 36:34.188
He treated me
like I was a no-talent.

36:35.954 --> 36:37.453
So I went to Plan B.

36:37.520 --> 36:39.021
What was "Plan B," Brian?

36:40.887 --> 36:43.387
I hired someone to scare him.

36:43.453 --> 36:44.420
Scare him.

36:44.487 --> 36:45.987
I gave him his card,
his address,

36:46.054 --> 36:47.687
I told him to get him
after lunch.

36:47.754 --> 36:49.754
He had the same schedule
every day, Johnson had.

36:49.821 --> 36:52.188
Except for the day that
he swapped cars with his wife.

36:52.254 --> 36:55.554
That moron told me "The wife's
just as good as the husband."

36:56.687 --> 36:57.620
Have a good practice.

36:57.687 --> 36:58.787
I'll see you at five.

36:58.854 --> 36:59.754
See you.
Okay.

37:02.754 --> 37:03.987
MAN:
Scream and I'll
blow your head off,

37:04.054 --> 37:05.587
and I'll do the same
to your little boy.

37:07.487 --> 37:10.987
You know, scare her
to scare him.

37:11.054 --> 37:13.154
Only he tells me,
he accidentally shot her.

37:13.221 --> 37:14.221
"Accidentally."

37:14.288 --> 37:16.954
<i>( sobbing )
MAN:
Drive.</i>

37:17.021 --> 37:18.021
Please.

37:21.687 --> 37:24.720
And all this time, Brian,
you told no one?

37:24.787 --> 37:26.887
I was afraid.

37:26.954 --> 37:28.121
I know about felony murder--

37:28.188 --> 37:29.420
it's like
I killed her myself, right?

37:29.520 --> 37:31.087
Yeah, that's exactly right,
my friend.

37:31.154 --> 37:32.420
You do know the law.

37:32.487 --> 37:34.288
Brian...

37:34.353 --> 37:36.520
Is that the man
that you hired?

37:36.587 --> 37:38.887
His name is Henry Darius.

37:40.121 --> 37:41.387
No.

37:41.453 --> 37:42.887
Who did you hire then?

37:42.954 --> 37:44.854
I only knew him as "Rosie."

37:44.921 --> 37:46.754
I have his
Internet address,

37:46.821 --> 37:48.921
but it was canceled
the day she disappeared.

37:48.987 --> 37:50.687
That should have been
the tip off for you, my friend.

37:50.754 --> 37:51.754
Hook him up, please.

37:54.353 --> 37:55.520
Please meet, Brian.

37:58.954 --> 38:00.587
Frank.

38:00.654 --> 38:01.854
Darius.

38:01.921 --> 38:04.087
Mac's chasing down video
from the security car.

38:04.154 --> 38:05.754
Okay, you hear anything,
you let me know.

38:05.821 --> 38:07.754
How's that loser fit in?

38:07.821 --> 38:10.320
That loser hired
somebody named Rosie

38:10.387 --> 38:12.121
who probably knows Darius.

38:12.188 --> 38:13.821
How?

38:13.887 --> 38:15.620
That is a good question, Frank.

38:15.687 --> 38:17.821
You need me, I'll be
with Lydia Johnson, all right?

38:17.887 --> 38:19.587
All right.

38:19.654 --> 38:21.987
WOODS:
The body's intact.

38:22.054 --> 38:24.121
Held together by her clothing.

38:24.188 --> 38:26.154
They're a mess,
t I did notice one thing.

38:30.154 --> 38:31.887
She was shot.

38:31.954 --> 38:35.087
Hole in the clothes on
the side of the blouse,

38:35.154 --> 38:36.154
and her waist.

38:37.554 --> 38:39.620
Projectile recovered
from her scapula.

38:39.687 --> 38:41.221
That's an odd angle,
Alexx.

38:46.587 --> 38:47.687
Right to left.

38:47.754 --> 38:48.821
Front to back.

38:48.887 --> 38:50.687
Could it have been
an accident?

38:51.854 --> 38:52.787
Not this one.

38:52.854 --> 38:54.954
Right in the temple.

38:55.021 --> 38:57.121
Right in the temple--
that's an execution.

38:57.188 --> 39:00.021
You know how much
head shots bleed.

39:00.087 --> 39:02.587
Right, so that explains
the blood spatter in the van,

39:02.654 --> 39:03.687
doesn't it.

39:04.787 --> 39:06.188
<i>( sobbing ):
Oh, please, God,</i>

39:06.254 --> 39:08.154
I have a baby!

39:11.987 --> 39:15.320
Now it makes sense why everyone
bought Darius' story.

39:15.387 --> 39:17.687
Just by the volume of blood,
fits his MO.

39:17.754 --> 39:19.587
But it wasn't Darius.

39:19.654 --> 39:21.353
It was this Rosie guy
who killed her

39:21.420 --> 39:23.188
and left the shovel
in the grave.

39:23.254 --> 39:24.887
Horatio.

39:24.954 --> 39:27.754
I hope you've got a lead
on the real killer.

40:02.787 --> 40:03.921
There he is.

40:05.987 --> 40:07.453
Thanks for
finding my mom.

40:07.520 --> 40:09.821
Well, I did it
with your help, Adam.

40:12.288 --> 40:13.687
Did you find the ponytail man?

40:13.754 --> 40:15.821
I haven't found him yet,
but I will.

40:15.887 --> 40:17.720
And I'll tell you
what I'm going to do.

40:17.787 --> 40:20.320
As soon as I find him,
I'm going to call you first.

40:20.387 --> 40:21.054
All right?

40:25.453 --> 40:27.821
So we got a deal?

40:27.887 --> 40:29.054
Okay.

40:29.121 --> 40:30.954
We got a deal.

40:41.821 --> 40:42.821
DUQUESNE:
He switched cars.

40:42.887 --> 40:45.487
Killed the driver
to get the car.

40:45.554 --> 40:47.587
Rescue's out and rolling.

40:47.654 --> 40:49.188
Tripp's running the plates
as we speak.

40:52.320 --> 40:54.021
Stop the video.

40:54.854 --> 40:56.021
Rewind that,
please.

40:57.954 --> 40:58.921
I saw his lips move.

40:58.987 --> 40:59.887
He said something.

40:59.954 --> 41:00.587
Yeah.

41:05.554 --> 41:07.054
"Happy birthday."

41:07.121 --> 41:09.054
How did he
know that?

41:09.121 --> 41:12.154
He's wearing a black Entek cap.

41:13.887 --> 41:17.487
If he took it with him,
he could wear it for disguise.

41:17.554 --> 41:20.188
I'm going to let
Miami P.D. know.

41:20.254 --> 41:22.188
You know, this road intersects
with I-95.

41:22.254 --> 41:26.188
It was over four hours ago,
he could be anywhere by now.

41:26.254 --> 41:27.320
How far do you think he got?

41:27.387 --> 41:29.154
I may have
the answer to that.

41:29.221 --> 41:31.954
Alexa Endecott just left
a message on our home machine.

41:32.021 --> 41:33.654
<i>ALEXA ( on tape recorder ):
Anyone, it's Alexa,</i>

41:33.720 --> 41:35.254
I've been taken by some guy.

41:35.320 --> 41:36.987
He's got, uh, brown hair...

41:37.054 --> 41:38.720
Got to go before he comes.

41:38.787 --> 41:39.787
I'm shutting my phone off.

41:39.854 --> 41:41.520
Wait a second, play that again.

41:41.587 --> 41:43.954
There was a sound
after she said "guy."

41:44.021 --> 41:45.854
Sounds like a horn.

41:48.254 --> 41:49.854
<i>ALEXA ( on tape recorder ):
...taken by some guy...</i>

41:49.921 --> 41:51.254
<i>( horn blowing on tape )
he's got, uh, brown hair...</i>

41:52.288 --> 41:55.921
He's got, uh, brown hair...

41:55.987 --> 41:57.221
If I've heard that sound once,

41:57.288 --> 41:58.787
I've heard it a thousand times.

41:58.854 --> 42:01.021
Horatio, you
worked Manhattan.

42:01.087 --> 42:02.654
Sounds and arrivals
and departures

42:02.720 --> 42:04.154
in and out of the city.

42:04.221 --> 42:05.654
That's the Staten Island Ferry.

42:07.353 --> 42:08.720
They're already in New York.

42:08.787 --> 42:12.221
Question is how'd they
get there so fast?

42:16.353 --> 42:18.188
Ms. Nivens?

42:18.254 --> 42:20.054
Turn around,
please, Ma'am.

42:20.121 --> 42:21.754
You have a G-4
don't you?.

42:21.821 --> 42:23.188
Why?

42:23.254 --> 42:25.188
That is the plane that
Darius just flew away on.

42:25.254 --> 42:27.654
Yes. And he left me here
because of you.

42:27.720 --> 42:29.987
You let him take
your private plane
to New York?

42:30.054 --> 42:32.754
With a younger woman,
if that doesn't that beat all.

42:32.821 --> 42:34.754
That younger woman is a hostage.

42:37.887 --> 42:39.021
Why New York?

42:39.087 --> 42:40.353
I don't know.

42:40.420 --> 42:42.787
He said he had
some kind of business there.

42:46.154 --> 42:47.420
What kind of business?

42:48.887 --> 42:50.987
He told me he was going
to New York City

42:51.054 --> 42:52.554
to make things right.
