WEBVTT

00:01.482 --> 00:04.013
Rachel?
What the hell's going on?

00:04.094 --> 00:06.091
Just getting my father
away from his jailor.

00:06.160 --> 00:08.294
And if you follow us,
I'm gonna go to the police.

00:08.364 --> 00:10.278
You cannot wean
your dad off of lithium here

00:10.349 --> 00:11.543
- in a grip truck.
- Okay, look.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.974
He should've never been on
those meds in the first place.

00:14.043 --> 00:15.104
My God, you're gorgeous.

00:15.181 --> 00:17.019
- This is Riley...
- Oh.

00:17.310 --> 00:18.707
My baby girl.

00:19.677 --> 00:22.178
This is what $400,000 looks like.

00:22.246 --> 00:24.372
I need you to know that
that bet,

00:24.458 --> 00:26.309
none of it means anything
compared to you.

00:26.387 --> 00:27.517
Why so sad?

00:27.594 --> 00:30.207
- Sissy no bounce?
- We broke up.

00:30.276 --> 00:33.504
This is what always
makes me feel better.

00:33.823 --> 00:36.317
This Emmy thing...
I think this is my one shot

00:36.386 --> 00:38.007
at leaving a legacy to my son,

00:38.091 --> 00:39.833
who I'll probably never see again.

00:39.939 --> 00:42.198
You can win an Emmy.
You can see your son.

00:42.267 --> 00:43.921
But you have to fight.

00:44.029 --> 00:46.125
You stay right where you are.
Don't you come near me.

00:46.194 --> 00:47.948
I see you. What are you doing to her?

00:48.017 --> 00:49.408
- I tried to protect you.
- Dad.

00:49.477 --> 00:50.637
- I couldn't protect you before.
- Dad, it's okay.

00:50.705 --> 00:52.183
Sweetheart,
it happened in my house!

00:52.252 --> 00:53.743
It should've been the safest
place of all for you.

00:53.811 --> 00:54.948
<i>It's okay.
Come on, Dad.</i>

00:55.025 --> 00:57.486
- It's too much, Rach.
- No, it's fine, Dad, really.

00:57.555 --> 00:59.408
It's what you need.

01:07.244 --> 01:08.729
Hey, Dad.
How's it going?

01:08.798 --> 01:09.893
It's going good.

01:09.970 --> 01:11.865
Well, it's just going like
yesterday, I guess.

01:11.942 --> 01:13.467
I know I've been calling a lot.

01:13.564 --> 01:14.898
I'm worried about you.

01:14.975 --> 01:16.650
No, don't... don't do that.

01:17.002 --> 01:18.478
You know, everybody says I'm...

01:18.658 --> 01:21.291
I'm taking very well
to the titrating, so...

01:21.517 --> 01:23.446
I'm gonna be off these drugs
before you know it.

01:23.515 --> 01:25.507
That's great.
Dad, no, that's really good.

01:25.686 --> 01:28.658
A-And what do they say? Do they
say, like, a few more weeks?

01:29.942 --> 01:31.916
Uh... yeah.

01:32.142 --> 01:33.605
- Rach, I don't know. I, uh...
- No, look, Dad.

01:33.673 --> 01:35.055
Listen to me.
I do, okay?

01:35.132 --> 01:37.554
I talked to your doctor, and
he completely agrees with me.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.830
You never should've been
on lithium in the first place.

01:39.899 --> 01:41.624
Just hang in there, okay?

01:41.853 --> 01:43.012
Yeah, okay.

01:43.081 --> 01:45.439
All right. I'll call you again tomorrow.

01:45.838 --> 01:47.548
I love you, Dad.

01:47.930 --> 01:49.572
I love you, too, sweetheart.

Are you okay?

01:59.310 --> 02:00.525
Yeah.

02:01.388 --> 02:03.525
- Did you talk to your dad?
- I did.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.312
He seems a little bit lonely,

02:05.381 --> 02:08.439
but I really think he's doing great.

02:08.551 --> 02:09.842
- Good.
- Mm-hmm.

02:10.006 --> 02:11.720
'Cause it's hometown dates.

02:11.897 --> 02:14.431
- You sure you're up for this?
- 100%.

02:17.210 --> 02:18.416
Great.

02:22.663 --> 02:23.892
And...

02:23.977 --> 02:25.744
there you go.

02:32.902 --> 02:33.997
Hmm.

02:40.126 --> 02:44.558
<i>♪ I'm going down, deeper still ♪</i>

02:44.635 --> 02:45.964
Oh. Hi.

02:46.041 --> 02:47.624
Mm-hmm.

02:47.701 --> 02:48.962
Oh. Okay.

02:49.063 --> 02:50.705
Now, I know
I don't play for this team,

02:50.774 --> 02:53.775
but damn if I don't appreciate
the eye candy.

02:54.908 --> 02:57.321
Look, I actually do work here.

02:57.390 --> 02:59.126
- Mm.
- Okay?

02:59.880 --> 03:01.741
This is really impressive, Quinn King.

03:01.810 --> 03:04.165
Yeah. Well, why don't you
stick around for the day?

03:04.360 --> 03:05.509
See how it's done.

03:05.603 --> 03:07.440
You know, unless you have
somewhere else to be.

03:07.508 --> 03:08.525
Yeah.

03:08.594 --> 03:10.853
Nowhere that looks this good
with its shirt off.

03:11.079 --> 03:12.940
I'll tell you that much.

03:15.428 --> 03:17.587
All right, hometown dates.
Pitch me, people.

03:17.703 --> 03:19.319
Well, I mean,
it's got to be Owen.

03:19.436 --> 03:21.457
We've got this gorgeous
single dad,

03:21.534 --> 03:23.071
he's got
an adorable daughter.

03:23.165 --> 03:24.828
She's never had a mother before.

03:24.905 --> 03:27.530
And we make an entire family
for this little girl.

03:27.607 --> 03:29.040
Yeah, 'cause nothing says "romance"

03:29.109 --> 03:31.759
like crayon stains in
Nowheresville, Colorado.

03:31.836 --> 03:33.544
It is so boring!

03:33.613 --> 03:35.064
Let's go to the U.K., baby...

03:35.111 --> 03:37.373
Jasper's family's country house
in the Cotswolds.

03:37.450 --> 03:39.906
Like, Serena is, like,
this close to forgiving him.

03:39.983 --> 03:41.987
I just think... You know, I really
think it should be Zach, though.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.543
- Of course you do.
- Shocker.

03:43.620 --> 03:45.993
Well, he's so cute. And he
would be great for her brand.

03:46.159 --> 03:47.784
Right, and he's also your last guy.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.552
- Mm-hmm.
- He is a Millennial dream.

03:49.629 --> 03:52.222
- He has 3.8...
- 3.8 million followers.

03:52.299 --> 03:54.275
We are all aware, Madison.

03:54.423 --> 03:56.251
Fiona, what do you think?

03:56.426 --> 03:58.400
- Come on up.
- Okay.

03:59.120 --> 04:00.582
Let's see.

04:01.736 --> 04:03.097
I say you go fireman.

04:03.166 --> 04:04.363
Thank you.

04:04.440 --> 04:07.425
Silicon Valley powerhouse
gives it all up

04:07.494 --> 04:10.541
to become a mom with a veteran
from Small Town USA,

04:10.712 --> 04:12.742
- healing a divided nation.
- Mnh-mnh.

04:12.819 --> 04:14.650
Or the death of feminism.

04:14.743 --> 04:15.948
Both very hot right now.

04:16.017 --> 04:17.238
Okay, but that's not
what this would be.

04:17.305 --> 04:19.086
This would be making a family

04:19.154 --> 04:21.380
for a young girl
who's never had a real mother.

04:21.457 --> 04:23.300
Either way, I mean,
it's got to be worth, what,

04:23.369 --> 04:25.051
two, three points in the demo?

04:25.128 --> 04:27.323
There's not gonna be a dry eye
from here to Peoria.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.853
I like the sound of that!

04:28.983 --> 04:32.548
Chet. You put on pants
this morning. How refreshing.

04:32.759 --> 04:34.497
You tucked your dick into yours.

04:34.802 --> 04:35.823
How nice.

04:35.892 --> 04:37.376
Jealous it's bigger?

04:37.970 --> 04:39.232
Touché, sir.

04:39.301 --> 04:41.382
Uh, can I talk to you
in private for a second?

04:41.509 --> 04:42.835
Uh, sure. And you...

04:42.966 --> 04:44.909
Owen's the one, so go sell your girl.

04:44.978 --> 04:46.417
Do you hear that?
Owen's the one.

04:46.486 --> 04:47.444
You hear that?
You want me to say it again?

04:47.513 --> 04:48.959
- I heard!
- Owen's the one.

04:50.916 --> 04:52.173
All right.

04:52.989 --> 04:54.680
I decided to take your advice.

04:54.892 --> 04:57.142
I called my attorney, and I'm gonna ask

04:57.251 --> 04:59.509
for supervised visitation with my son.

04:59.624 --> 05:01.134
Wow. Good for you.

05:01.212 --> 05:04.157
I'm sober. I'm taking parenting classes.

05:04.353 --> 05:05.862
There's just one thing.

05:06.056 --> 05:08.619
My attorney says...

05:09.166 --> 05:11.220
I need a character witness.

05:15.775 --> 05:17.637
What, a-are you asking me

05:17.714 --> 05:19.251
to be your character witness?

05:19.549 --> 05:22.761
Who else? I mean, we were
together for 10 years!

05:22.830 --> 05:24.026
Nobody knows me better.

05:24.095 --> 05:26.300
Okay, I was your mistress, all right?

05:26.369 --> 05:28.018
That's not exactly
an ace in the hole.

05:28.087 --> 05:29.448
No, that's the point.

05:29.525 --> 05:33.619
W-We're no longer together,
so you have no vested interest.

05:33.696 --> 05:35.325
You know,
I-I don't know, Chet.

05:35.394 --> 05:36.619
I don't know.

05:37.227 --> 05:39.650
My attorney says
that you're my best shot.

05:41.037 --> 05:43.025
Because you're my only shot, really.

05:47.076 --> 05:49.275
I'm baring my soul here.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.212
Oh, yeah?

05:51.381 --> 05:53.126
You still have one of those?

05:53.611 --> 05:55.766
I want a relationship with my son.

05:58.212 --> 05:59.884
Fine. Are we done?

06:00.173 --> 06:01.268
Oh, yes!

06:01.337 --> 06:03.291
Oh! Thank you.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.103
Mm.

06:05.915 --> 06:07.391
Okay. All right, all right.

06:07.460 --> 06:08.970
Look, don't make me
regret it.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.400
Ohh.

06:11.251 --> 06:13.129
I really think
that you should pick Owen.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.393
- Owen?
- Yeah.

06:14.470 --> 06:16.175
I think there's got to be a reason

06:16.244 --> 06:18.564
why you guys had that connection
on the first night.

06:18.633 --> 06:20.729
I don't know.
We are really different people.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.673
I mean, he's a really good guy.

06:22.854 --> 06:24.942
I mean, he's a simple guy...

06:25.114 --> 06:27.373
in the best possible way,
just like your father.

06:27.450 --> 06:29.596
You said that your parents have
been married, like, 40 years?

06:29.664 --> 06:32.446
- Uh-huh.
- And you got to want that for yourself.

06:33.087 --> 06:34.971
Is this what Quinn wants
or what you want?

06:35.040 --> 06:36.899
- Honestly? Both.
- Mm-hmm.

06:37.126 --> 06:38.997
But that doesn't mean
that it's the wrong choice.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.423
Trust me on this.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.321
He could be the one.

06:43.132 --> 06:48.561
Five suitors, four continents,
but only one hometown date.

06:48.766 --> 06:51.595
Serena must decide today
which man will not only give her

06:51.759 --> 06:52.969
the key to his home...

06:53.251 --> 06:55.923
but also to his heart.

06:56.679 --> 06:59.776
I've thought a lot about what
the hometown date really means.

06:59.899 --> 07:03.063
Um, it's a chance for me to see
how I fit into your lives

07:03.219 --> 07:06.048
and into the lives of those
who love you the most.

07:06.470 --> 07:08.447
So, with that in mind,

07:08.665 --> 07:10.923
the place that I most want to go...

07:11.295 --> 07:13.922
is Frontier Creek, Colorado.

07:15.832 --> 07:17.649
Owen, will you take me home?

07:18.009 --> 07:19.100
Umm...

07:20.793 --> 07:22.532
Rachel, what is happening?

07:22.601 --> 07:24.762
Your boy is about to tank
my heartland hometown.

07:24.911 --> 07:26.536
I'm sorry. Can we... can we cut?

07:26.613 --> 07:28.768
No! No, we cannot cut!

07:28.845 --> 07:30.115
Yeah, w-we're not cutting, dude.

07:30.183 --> 07:32.108
Well, I-I'm gonna need a second, so...

07:32.185 --> 07:33.673
No... Jeremy, go! Follow him!

07:33.750 --> 07:35.278
Do not let him out of your sight!

07:35.355 --> 07:36.876
- Go! Go! Go!
- Owen!

07:37.920 --> 07:39.376
Owen. What's going on?

07:39.524 --> 07:41.013
Hey, hey!

07:41.090 --> 07:43.477
You know, it's just, I...

07:43.816 --> 07:45.915
I'm just not sure about
some of your choices.

07:45.984 --> 07:47.572
What does that mean?

07:47.670 --> 07:50.618
It means you found out that
Jasper was here on a bet,

07:50.900 --> 07:52.259
and then you kept him...

07:52.391 --> 07:54.030
after he bought his way back in.

07:54.107 --> 07:56.132
Is this a guy with a conscience?

07:56.209 --> 07:57.470
The peonies?

07:57.539 --> 07:59.720
That was him trying
to apologize. It was sweet.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.371
Of course you thought that.

08:01.448 --> 08:02.702
Because it's him.

08:02.779 --> 08:04.971
Because you guys know the same people.

08:05.048 --> 08:08.311
- You went to the same schools.
- That is not why I forgave him.

08:08.388 --> 08:09.976
You were a bet, Serena.

08:10.053 --> 08:12.515
Jasper didn't even know who
I was when he made that bet!

08:12.592 --> 08:14.146
And that's my point!

08:14.223 --> 08:15.592
He's still the guy
that would've slept

08:15.660 --> 08:16.778
with anyone to win a bet.

08:16.847 --> 08:18.226
And if you're really okay
with that,

08:18.294 --> 08:19.531
I don't think you're the kind
of person who I want

08:19.599 --> 08:21.191
to take home to my daughter.

08:21.583 --> 08:23.637
Oh, great!

08:24.158 --> 08:26.293
You need to fix this, Rachel.

08:34.544 --> 08:35.668
Serena? Oh, my God.

08:35.745 --> 08:37.191
Honestly, I'm, like, so sorry.

08:37.301 --> 08:38.746
I had no idea that
that was gonna happen.

08:38.815 --> 08:40.232
Like, that was not a setup, okay?

08:40.301 --> 08:41.682
- I promise.
- I-I know. I know.

08:41.751 --> 08:43.780
But what Owen said,
that was completely unfair.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.511
No, that was completely fair.

08:45.588 --> 08:47.392
I mean, I have been making
allowances for Jasper

08:47.460 --> 08:49.682
that I-I wouldn't make for anyone else.

08:49.809 --> 08:52.218
I'm gonna head back out there.
I'll talk to Owen.

08:52.295 --> 08:54.424
- I'll get him back on board.
- No, I will.

08:54.543 --> 08:55.792
I want to talk to Owen.

08:55.934 --> 08:58.491
Yeah, I w-want to talk to him myself.

08:58.629 --> 09:00.863
I need a camera on Serena... now.

09:06.275 --> 09:07.433
Hi.

09:07.510 --> 09:10.004
It's hard to get away in this place.

09:10.113 --> 09:12.382
Look, I'm sorry about what I said.
It was...

09:12.488 --> 09:13.242
No. No, no.

09:13.319 --> 09:15.176
You were exactly right.

09:15.510 --> 09:18.130
The truth is, I've dated guys
like Jasper my whole life,

09:18.199 --> 09:20.179
and it's gotten me nowhere.

09:20.356 --> 09:22.681
I mean, it's you that
I want to go home with.

09:22.758 --> 09:25.122
I mean, you've...
you've been there for me

09:25.191 --> 09:26.355
since the first night.

09:26.432 --> 09:30.051
And... honestly, I've neglected you.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.415
I don't know why,

09:31.492 --> 09:32.840
but it is so clear

09:32.909 --> 09:36.606
that you are the only
truly good man here.

09:36.872 --> 09:39.632
I'm just really sorry that I
didn't realize it till now.

09:39.709 --> 09:41.204
Will you give me another chance?

09:41.281 --> 09:43.873
Take me home with you.
Let me meet Riley.

09:43.950 --> 09:46.660
This is good, Rachel! Look at you!

09:46.986 --> 09:48.418
I think...

09:49.121 --> 09:50.743
that Riley's gonna love you.

09:50.820 --> 09:53.082
She made that almost seem believable.

09:53.159 --> 09:54.246
And... cut!

09:54.323 --> 09:56.052
See? Come on. It's real between them.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.954
Well, real or not, whatever gets her

09:58.031 --> 10:00.152
all Rocky Mountain High is fine by me.

10:00.229 --> 10:02.087
W... Uh, who's Riley? Is she the kid?

10:02.246 --> 10:04.227
Mm-hmm. She's Owen's daughter.
She's so cute.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.058
She loves dogs. She hates clowns.

10:06.135 --> 10:08.231
I mean, your adorable,
typical 6-year-old.

10:08.308 --> 10:10.262
Okay! All right, people! Let's go!

10:10.339 --> 10:11.743
I need everybody to make sure they take

10:11.811 --> 10:13.236
their altitude-sickness pills.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.538
I don't another Peru debacle.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.637
Good trip, everyone!

10:18.891 --> 10:20.754
<i>Final call. Buses and trucks are</i>

10:20.823 --> 10:22.636
<i>leaving for the airport in five minutes.</i>

10:22.763 --> 10:23.728
Jay!

10:23.824 --> 10:25.439
No hard feelings, bud.

10:25.532 --> 10:27.624
I know you had your heart
set on merry old England.

10:27.701 --> 10:29.301
I thought for sure you were
gonna send in Jasper

10:29.369 --> 10:30.840
- during Serena's apology.
- Please. I don't care.

10:30.908 --> 10:32.608
It gives me time to work
on "Passport to Dance."

10:32.676 --> 10:34.551
But you have fun freezing your ass off.

10:34.809 --> 10:36.285
Bye!

10:38.722 --> 10:39.812
Doc.

10:39.905 --> 10:40.949
Hey.

10:41.018 --> 10:42.035
How's Rachel?

10:42.104 --> 10:43.949
Yeah, Serena's in the other van.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.230
That whole thing that happened
with her dad...

10:46.576 --> 10:47.934
Yeah. Listen, Jeremy.

10:48.192 --> 10:50.149
Um, I understand your concern,

10:50.218 --> 10:52.907
but I think it's best for you

10:53.056 --> 10:56.071
if you kept a little
distance from Rachel.

10:56.322 --> 10:59.032
Oh, because you're the only one
that can save her now?

10:59.875 --> 11:01.610
Have a good trip.

11:06.540 --> 11:07.798
Hey, babe.

11:07.934 --> 11:09.729
Do you think this jacket's
warm enough for Colorado?

11:09.797 --> 11:11.818
Or should I bring my down?

11:11.887 --> 11:13.483
All right, I'll see you guys
there. I'll see you guys.

11:13.551 --> 11:14.727
Um...

11:15.048 --> 11:17.674
You know, actually... neither.

11:17.767 --> 11:20.321
They want you to stay here and
shoot "A" cam at the mansion.

11:20.663 --> 11:22.058
Your name's gonna be on the call sheet.

11:22.126 --> 11:23.977
It's a legit promotion,
if you're up for it.

11:24.454 --> 11:26.775
This is huge! Of course I'm up for it!

11:28.341 --> 11:29.540
Thank you.

11:30.685 --> 11:31.843
You guys ready?

11:31.912 --> 11:34.196
Let's get this party started!

11:36.737 --> 11:38.540
Nice!

11:38.906 --> 11:41.626
A real step up from the
assistants pool, King.

11:41.786 --> 11:45.258
Yeah, I knew I had made it
when I got my own bar cart.

11:45.391 --> 11:46.790
Oh, man.

11:46.894 --> 11:50.477
Your deadbeat dad must be up
your ass looking for handouts.

11:50.808 --> 11:52.496
How is Randy?

11:52.753 --> 11:53.915
Actually, he's dead.

11:53.984 --> 11:55.172
Ohh!

11:55.321 --> 11:57.483
Damn. I'm sorry. I didn't...

11:57.646 --> 11:58.967
Wait.

11:59.193 --> 12:01.351
You talk to your mom at the funeral?

12:01.428 --> 12:03.056
- How'd that go?
- Well, it was great.

12:03.133 --> 12:05.298
'Cause she didn't show,
as usual.

12:06.494 --> 12:08.110
- Uh, listen.
- Hmm?

12:09.517 --> 12:12.079
I have a proposition for you.

12:13.240 --> 12:15.001
I'm so flattered, honey.

12:15.219 --> 12:16.403
But you're not my type.

12:16.480 --> 12:18.969
It is a business proposition.

12:19.046 --> 12:21.275
- Look, Gary promised me four shows...
- Mm-hmm.

12:21.352 --> 12:22.532
And now I got to deliver.

12:22.616 --> 12:26.439
So, what do you say you and I partner up

12:26.571 --> 12:29.216
and we burn down this
boys club together?

12:29.285 --> 12:30.473
Quinn, uh...

12:30.594 --> 12:32.760
You said that you wanted
to get back into scripted,

12:32.829 --> 12:34.675
and I am up for that, too.

12:35.792 --> 12:37.977
- I can't.
- Why not?

12:38.232 --> 12:39.927
I only want to get back into scripted

12:40.004 --> 12:41.930
if I can make high-end, premium content.

12:42.206 --> 12:43.626
And that's not your brand.

12:43.849 --> 12:46.352
I am trying to make that my brand.

12:46.555 --> 12:47.882
Quinn.

12:47.975 --> 12:50.259
"Everlasting" is a schlocky dating show.

12:50.434 --> 12:52.889
"Will she find love?" Who cares?

12:53.013 --> 12:56.360
The kinds of stories I'm talking
about strike a cultural chord.

12:56.620 --> 12:58.145
They mean more, go deeper.

12:58.214 --> 13:00.891
Excuse me, but I am finding a mommy

13:00.960 --> 13:03.089
for Little Orphan What's-Her-Face.

13:03.158 --> 13:04.311
That is deep.

13:04.380 --> 13:05.842
Quinn, you can't seriously believe

13:05.911 --> 13:07.002
what Rachel is selling?

13:07.071 --> 13:08.649
I mean, she's kind of a nutjob.

13:08.736 --> 13:10.724
America's gonna eat it up.

13:10.801 --> 13:13.792
I can serve high-end without
putting people to sleep

13:13.861 --> 13:16.016
with this PBS euthanasia crap.

13:16.093 --> 13:17.805
You really think this show is that good?

13:17.925 --> 13:20.094
No. I am.

13:22.900 --> 13:24.798
Hey, Rach, uh...

13:25.402 --> 13:27.097
I just want to see,
how's your dad doing?

13:27.174 --> 13:29.600
- Um, he's great, actually, he is.
- Yeah?

13:29.677 --> 13:33.391
Yeah. Um, look, I just wanted
to thank you for, um...

13:34.374 --> 13:35.548
your help.

13:36.580 --> 13:38.208
I always liked your dad, you know?

13:38.285 --> 13:39.829
I don't know if he liked me, but...

13:40.229 --> 13:42.087
Are you kidding me? Thank you.

13:42.156 --> 13:44.087
He actually told me to marry you.

13:44.625 --> 13:46.780
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

13:47.040 --> 13:49.440
I mean, he was also on drugs
at the time, so...

13:49.509 --> 13:50.558
Yeah, yeah.

13:50.627 --> 13:52.886
All right, guys, we've got
"B" camera waiting inside.

13:52.963 --> 13:54.458
Serena, please, let's bring you over.

13:54.535 --> 13:56.056
Owen. Thank you.

13:56.133 --> 14:00.352
All right, here we go.
We are rolling in... 3, 2...

14:04.441 --> 14:06.051
Hey, guys.

14:06.471 --> 14:08.296
Nice to meet you.

14:08.679 --> 14:10.274
Oh, my goodness. Thank you.

14:10.351 --> 14:11.381
Daddy!

14:11.450 --> 14:13.040
Riley! Come here!

14:13.301 --> 14:14.989
Hi, baby girl! How are you?

14:15.067 --> 14:16.501
Good? Yeah?

14:17.321 --> 14:18.582
I want you to meet somebody.

14:18.659 --> 14:19.579
Hi!

14:19.656 --> 14:21.518
- You're my new mommy!
- Oh! What?

14:21.595 --> 14:23.541
Uh, no, I'm not. I...

14:24.736 --> 14:26.483
I mean, I-I might be...

14:27.358 --> 14:28.670
someday.

14:29.264 --> 14:30.692
Um, can you shake hands?

14:30.871 --> 14:32.022
Yeah.

14:32.236 --> 14:33.927
Got to shake a little tougher than that.

14:34.001 --> 14:35.709
There you go. That's a good,
strong handshake.

14:35.777 --> 14:37.230
Uh... Daddy?

14:37.307 --> 14:39.135
Riley, why don't we go get
you some ginger ale, huh?

14:39.203 --> 14:40.432
Okay.

14:50.115 --> 14:51.578
What the hell are you doing?

14:51.655 --> 14:52.875
What does it look like?

14:53.021 --> 14:54.715
Think this is gonna impress Serena?

14:55.020 --> 14:56.240
Digging a hole?

14:56.309 --> 14:57.724
It's not a hole, mate.

14:57.793 --> 14:59.466
It's an infiltration pit.

14:59.535 --> 15:01.224
The mansion's got
a huge runoff problem,

15:01.293 --> 15:02.826
and this pit will allow the rainwater

15:02.895 --> 15:04.466
to percolate down through the soil.

15:04.535 --> 15:07.333
- So you're digging a hole, then?
- That's very funny.

15:07.402 --> 15:09.871
It's actually an environmental disaster.

15:10.020 --> 15:13.326
And none of this is to, uh,
impress Serena?

15:13.395 --> 15:16.091
I'm pretty sure my time for
impressing Serena is long gone,

15:16.168 --> 15:17.188
all right?

15:17.265 --> 15:18.890
So, while I'm still here,

15:18.967 --> 15:21.138
I need to get back to the real
reason I came on this show.

15:21.206 --> 15:22.208
And what's that?

15:22.277 --> 15:23.915
Tell the world the
environment needs saving.

15:23.983 --> 15:27.637
And something as little as a hole,

15:27.946 --> 15:29.308
anyone can make a difference.

15:29.377 --> 15:31.030
- Maybe even you.
- For the love of God.

15:31.099 --> 15:33.706
My investments have made more
in interest for clean water

15:33.775 --> 15:37.369
than your sodding Eco-business
could make in a lifetime.

15:38.147 --> 15:39.592
Lady, you okay?

15:39.733 --> 15:41.713
I don't know. I just,
like, froze, or something.

15:41.790 --> 15:43.885
She's a kid. She doesn't
even know what she's saying.

15:43.962 --> 15:45.783
No, Rachel, she seemed pretty clear.

15:45.860 --> 15:47.885
- She's 6 years old.
- I know. I know that.

15:47.962 --> 15:49.924
But I don't have a lot
of experience with kids.

15:50.001 --> 15:52.724
My nephews live back east,
so I never see them.

15:52.801 --> 15:55.330
O-Obviously, I knew that Owen
had a daughter,

15:55.407 --> 15:56.894
I just, you know,

15:56.971 --> 15:58.909
I'm just not really sure that
I'm ready to be insta-mom.

15:58.977 --> 16:01.269
All Riley wants is somebody to love her.

16:01.346 --> 16:03.768
I mean, she's never even had a real mom.

16:03.845 --> 16:05.440
And you would be an incredible one.

16:05.517 --> 16:06.772
Yeah?

16:06.914 --> 16:08.615
Must be nice being a corporate shill

16:08.687 --> 16:11.313
who's never gotten dirt
under his fingernails or...

16:11.390 --> 16:14.082
or broken a sweat, like a real man.

16:14.159 --> 16:15.947
Hmm. That's funny.

16:16.024 --> 16:17.485
- Thank you.
- You're a funny man.

16:17.562 --> 16:19.454
Um... you know what?

16:19.531 --> 16:20.780
I...

16:21.363 --> 16:23.530
I think I, uh...

16:24.199 --> 16:26.090
I think I feel like digging a hole, too.

16:26.167 --> 16:28.639
You sure you don't want to just
sit and watch? Get a cup of tea?

16:28.707 --> 16:30.569
Just take it easy, Princess, all righty?

16:30.811 --> 16:32.217
Right. Watch me.

16:32.807 --> 16:34.600
Hey, what the hell is this?

16:35.080 --> 16:37.162
Are you just giving up now?

16:37.545 --> 16:40.905
Yo. I was meditating.
You just blocked my chi.

16:40.982 --> 16:42.440
Look, you are my last guy.

16:42.517 --> 16:44.312
If you get cut,
then I go home, too.

16:44.389 --> 16:45.510
I ain't goin' nowhere.

16:45.579 --> 16:47.234
We need a plan. So, what're you...

16:47.303 --> 16:48.922
- Look, you got to stop
- stressing, all right?

16:48.990 --> 16:51.015
I got my own plan.
I'm playing the slow game.

16:51.084 --> 16:52.453
Serena and I, we got a connection.

16:52.522 --> 16:54.465
- I'm like her confidant.
- Okay, she doesn't want a friend.

16:54.533 --> 16:56.024
She's looking for a husband.

16:56.101 --> 16:59.068
Hey. Sorry to interrupt. I just...

16:59.734 --> 17:01.795
Should I be filming that?

17:04.172 --> 17:06.656
Yes, you should definitely
be filming that.

17:07.842 --> 17:09.170
Ooh...

17:09.306 --> 17:10.339
Ahhh...

17:10.612 --> 17:11.842
Ahh...

17:12.131 --> 17:13.732
Hey. Owen.

17:14.015 --> 17:16.845
Owen, hey, I'm... I'm so sorry
the "mommy" thing upset me.

17:16.922 --> 17:19.803
I was afraid that this was all
gonna be too much, too soon.

17:19.958 --> 17:23.201
It's not fair to you,
and it's not fair to Riley.

17:23.691 --> 17:25.974
You got to understand,
she's everything to me.

17:26.137 --> 17:28.597
So if things aren't good with her,

17:28.800 --> 17:30.772
then nothing else matters.

17:31.065 --> 17:34.170
I think we just need some
daddy/daughter time... alone.

17:34.369 --> 17:36.852
Sure. Yeah, no.
Take all the time you need.

17:39.651 --> 17:41.628
Hey. Rachel, I'm worried about this.

17:42.105 --> 17:43.800
I mean, I feel like we didn't
really think

17:43.877 --> 17:44.943
- this through.
- I thought this through.

17:45.011 --> 17:46.550
I thought that this
was a really good idea,

17:46.618 --> 17:48.264
which is why you are here.

17:49.284 --> 17:51.542
Maybe Owen and I could,
like, sneak away later,

17:51.619 --> 17:53.010
- I mean, just the two of us.
- No!

17:53.087 --> 17:54.849
Owen and Riley are, like,
this package deal.

17:54.926 --> 17:57.039
You can't just ship her off.

17:58.226 --> 18:00.518
Well, look, Serena, if you're
not seeing her as a plus,

18:00.595 --> 18:02.257
maybe this isn't the right fit for you.

18:02.334 --> 18:03.591
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

18:03.668 --> 18:05.127
This is all happening a little fast.

18:05.196 --> 18:06.705
I think I just...

18:06.935 --> 18:09.361
I just need a minute to...
think, okay?

18:09.430 --> 18:11.376
Yeah. Okay.

18:16.244 --> 18:17.963
Hey. Rachel?

18:18.033 --> 18:19.783
Aren't you supposed to
be in the middle of a date?

18:19.851 --> 18:21.075
Is there a problem?

18:21.152 --> 18:23.040
Uh, yeah, actually, there is.

18:23.117 --> 18:24.542
Look, I screwed up, okay?

18:24.619 --> 18:26.110
Serena's just, like, not into it.

18:26.187 --> 18:28.450
The little girl ran into
her arms and called her "mommy,"

18:28.527 --> 18:30.748
and it just completely
freaked Serena out.

18:30.825 --> 18:33.284
Well, we could definitely
make something out of that.

18:33.361 --> 18:35.790
Okay, yeah, well, maybe you can,
but I'm just not going to.

18:35.867 --> 18:37.592
Ah! This is what I was afraid of.

18:37.669 --> 18:39.957
Rachel, "Heartland Hometown Hero"

18:40.034 --> 18:42.351
needs to win for ratings... period!

18:44.806 --> 18:46.898
Hey, Jay!

18:46.975 --> 18:48.533
Hey, what? What's up?

18:48.610 --> 18:51.903
Uh... Rachel's brain has
officially turned to mush.

18:51.980 --> 18:54.409
I need you to prep Alexi,
because if Owen goes south,

18:54.486 --> 18:57.011
then I need your guy to jump in
and spice things up.

18:57.088 --> 18:58.776
- Copy that.
- Great.

18:58.853 --> 19:02.004
Somebody go book me
a flight to Colorado!

19:18.204 --> 19:19.900
What's up? What're you doing here?

19:19.977 --> 19:22.435
You, uh, scared me a little
on the phone, Rachel.

19:22.512 --> 19:24.534
Where is Serena?

19:24.611 --> 19:26.302
Why is she not in full mommy-mode?

19:26.379 --> 19:28.008
I told you, that's not gonna happen.

19:28.085 --> 19:29.706
And why is that?

19:29.783 --> 19:32.742
Look, I think it's not too late
to pull the plug.

19:32.819 --> 19:35.482
You know, we could still head to
England. Jay was right.

19:35.559 --> 19:37.914
Um, Owen is your guy.

19:37.991 --> 19:39.609
- And you're just gonna tank him like that?
- Right. No, I know.

19:39.677 --> 19:41.288
He's my guy, and I care
about him... and Serena,

19:41.356 --> 19:43.695
which is why I just... Look, I
really don't want to force this.

19:43.763 --> 19:45.819
What happened to "making a family"?

19:45.888 --> 19:48.172
Serena isn't into it, and, what,
Riley's gonna grow up

19:48.241 --> 19:49.635
thinking that this was her fault?

19:49.712 --> 19:51.023
I'm not doing that to a 6-year-old.

19:51.091 --> 19:54.694
Oh, my God. This is not
your family, Rachel.

19:54.814 --> 19:58.040
Riley is not you,
and Serena is not Olive.

19:58.132 --> 19:59.957
I'm not gonna
let her screw up this kid.

20:00.037 --> 20:01.286
We can't make Serena feel something

20:01.354 --> 20:02.570
she doesn't want to feel,
okay, Quinn?

20:02.638 --> 20:05.389
That is our entire job
description, okay?

20:05.458 --> 20:08.254
If she is not feeling it,
we make her feel it.

20:08.405 --> 20:10.344
So, go... do your job.

20:13.433 --> 20:15.100
Hey, don't get too attached
to this scenery.

20:15.168 --> 20:16.805
If I have anything to say
about this, we're headed home

20:16.873 --> 20:19.061
- after this last setup.
- Why? What's going on?

20:19.138 --> 20:20.600
Quinn wants to make big drama here,

20:20.677 --> 20:21.934
but it's not good for the kid.

20:22.011 --> 20:23.669
So be thinking a "tearful goodbye"

20:23.746 --> 20:24.937
as the shot composition.

20:25.014 --> 20:26.472
Just a heads-up.

20:26.549 --> 20:28.871
- Hey, uh, Serena?
- Hey.

20:28.948 --> 20:30.548
Can I, uh, talk to you before
we head to Owen's?

20:30.616 --> 20:31.916
Listen, I-I've been thinking about it...

20:31.984 --> 20:33.088
- Yeah.
- And you're totally right.

20:33.156 --> 20:34.777
I have to make Riley the priority.

20:34.854 --> 20:36.621
Seriously? You know, she
loves pancakes, so...

20:36.689 --> 20:38.326
it's, like, the only thing
I actually know how to make.

20:38.394 --> 20:40.819
I'll make her blueberry pancakes
and braid her hair.

20:40.888 --> 20:42.680
And she's got to love that, right?

20:43.139 --> 20:44.787
- Come on.
- What?

20:44.864 --> 20:47.156
- Is this even what you want?
- I am trying to want it.

20:47.233 --> 20:48.967
I mean, it's what you said...
it's a package deal.

20:49.035 --> 20:51.206
This whole thing is supposed to
be about finding the right guy,

20:51.274 --> 20:53.429
not proving that you can
get an "A" at everything.

20:53.506 --> 20:55.944
Oh, so all that stuff you said about
Owen being the perfect guy for me,

20:56.012 --> 20:57.509
I'm just supposed to forget all of that?

20:57.577 --> 20:58.880
No. That's not what I'm saying.
I'm just saying that this

20:58.948 --> 21:01.381
is not about Owen. This is about Riley.

21:01.848 --> 21:04.640
Look, I know what it's like
to be the daughter

21:04.717 --> 21:07.510
of a driven woman who
always put herself first.

21:07.587 --> 21:08.781
Okay, that's not who I am.

21:08.858 --> 21:10.216
I... I mean, it's not...

21:10.293 --> 21:12.639
- who I want to be.
- I know. I'm sorry. I...

21:13.259 --> 21:16.467
I'm just saying that if you do
this before you're really ready,

21:16.562 --> 21:18.850
you and Riley could
both come to regret it.

21:19.047 --> 21:20.267
Okay, let me think about it.

21:20.336 --> 21:21.494
You know, when we get back
to the mansion...

21:21.562 --> 21:22.858
No, if you're gonna do it,
if you're gonna cut him,

21:22.926 --> 21:24.213
you need to do it right now.

21:24.403 --> 21:25.707
Let's let him stay here
and be with his kid.

21:25.775 --> 21:27.024
He can't leave her again.

21:27.093 --> 21:29.156
We're gonna make him look like
this incredible father.

21:29.224 --> 21:30.582
There's gonna be women, like,

21:30.651 --> 21:32.576
lining up for miles to go out with him.

21:32.733 --> 21:34.646
I mean, you're doing the guy a favor.

21:35.907 --> 21:37.357
I'll go get Owen ready.

21:38.784 --> 21:40.546
This is the right thing to be doing.

21:40.623 --> 21:42.248
Fine. I'll call him myself.

21:42.317 --> 21:43.771
Uh, hey, Rachel.

21:43.856 --> 21:46.215
Um, uh, where's Hurt Locker
and Honey Boo Boo?

21:46.292 --> 21:48.054
Uh, well, I think Serena's
about to cut Owen,

21:48.131 --> 21:49.655
and then we're gonna pack it up.

21:49.732 --> 21:51.858
So you just did the opposite
of what I asked?

21:51.935 --> 21:54.790
Mmmmm... yes.

21:54.915 --> 21:57.526
Great. This'll be a hometown
date to remember.

21:57.603 --> 22:00.394
Come on. It's gonna be some big,
huge, tearful goodbye.

22:00.463 --> 22:02.230
There's not gonna be a dry eye
in the house.

22:02.299 --> 22:03.207
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

22:03.276 --> 22:04.679
Then what else will be on TV
that night?

22:04.747 --> 22:06.606
Because that's what I will be watching.

22:06.683 --> 22:09.342
No, Rachel, we're gonna
blow this thing up.

22:09.419 --> 22:11.544
Talk to me. How much longer?

22:11.621 --> 22:15.414
Our contestants have returned
to a primal state

22:15.491 --> 22:20.386
in pursuit of winning the lovely
Serena's affection.

22:20.463 --> 22:22.059
Excuse me.

22:26.098 --> 22:27.364
Ohh!

22:28.634 --> 22:30.526
It seems that August

22:30.603 --> 22:34.029
has penetrated the deepest
within the earth.

22:34.106 --> 22:35.768
That's not why I did this.

22:35.845 --> 22:37.566
August is the winner!

22:37.643 --> 22:40.402
It's not a competition, Graham.
It's an infiltration pit.

22:40.479 --> 22:42.208
Wait, wait. What does
he get for the win?

22:42.285 --> 22:44.373
Uh... a one-on-one date with Serena.

22:44.450 --> 22:46.312
Hold on. Hold on.
Ain't nobody tell me that.

22:46.389 --> 22:47.968
Hold on. Give me that shovel.

22:50.289 --> 22:52.151
This is a joke.
All right, I'm out of here.

22:52.228 --> 22:54.053
This is stupid. I'm done. I'm out, too.

22:54.130 --> 22:55.788
Follow my lead. Female gaze.

22:55.865 --> 22:56.956
You got me?

22:57.033 --> 22:58.687
Absolutely.

22:58.764 --> 23:00.480
Let's sex this thing up.

23:01.500 --> 23:03.141
August, you can't go back
to the mansion like that.

23:03.209 --> 23:04.638
You're filthy. What are you doing?!

23:04.707 --> 23:07.563
Give it here! I'll do it myself.
What's wrong with you?

23:07.640 --> 23:08.931
Hey, Jasper, get back here!

23:09.008 --> 23:10.412
I am not your show monkey, little girl.

23:10.480 --> 23:11.859
Good luck with this, Tarzan.

23:13.112 --> 23:14.970
What the hell are you doing?

23:15.047 --> 23:15.585
Are you a child?

23:15.662 --> 23:17.319
You need to clean yourself
off there, big boy.

23:17.387 --> 23:18.641
- Okay.
- You all right?

23:18.718 --> 23:20.051
- What are you...
- Oh, there we go!

23:20.119 --> 23:21.356
That's nice and clean for you, buddy.

23:21.424 --> 23:22.912
Is this soft-core enough for you?

23:22.989 --> 23:24.826
Well, we had girls in bikinis
on the North Pole.

23:24.894 --> 23:26.782
I'd say this is revenge.

23:26.859 --> 23:29.188
I'm really glad Jeremy didn't
take you to Colorado.

23:29.265 --> 23:31.157
- I was a little surprised, though.
- Why?

23:31.234 --> 23:33.259
Hometown dates are like crew prom.

23:33.336 --> 23:36.495
There's hotel rooms and
mini bars and doors that lock.

23:36.572 --> 23:38.085
Everybody hooks up.

23:41.173 --> 23:42.206
Hey!

23:44.176 --> 23:46.135
Hey, I need to talk to you.

23:46.212 --> 23:48.003
Yeah. We'll go back to my house.

23:48.080 --> 23:50.218
I know they're getting dinner
ready, and you don't want to...

23:50.286 --> 23:52.074
You okay?

23:52.151 --> 23:53.442
Like, not great.

23:53.519 --> 23:55.314
Cutting him is best for the kid.

23:55.391 --> 23:57.783
You're looking out for her,
Rach. It's...

23:57.860 --> 23:59.114
It's really nice.

23:59.191 --> 24:00.874
You're doing the right thing.

24:02.428 --> 24:03.953
I'm sorry that things have been

24:04.030 --> 24:06.158
- a little rough with Riley and...
- No, no, no.

24:06.235 --> 24:07.423
No, no. She's...

24:07.500 --> 24:09.795
She's amazing, and you
are such a good dad.

24:09.872 --> 24:12.920
I mean, I-I can really see
how much you love her.

24:13.873 --> 24:15.931
No, no! Get away from me!

24:16.008 --> 24:17.366
Oh, you want a balloon?

24:17.443 --> 24:19.335
- Hey! Get away from her!
- They hired me.

24:19.412 --> 24:21.813
- Daddy! The clown is scary!
- She's terrified of clowns, man.

24:21.881 --> 24:23.218
- They hired me to give out balloons.
- I don't care! Just get out of here!

24:23.286 --> 24:25.399
- Right now, okay?
- Quinn, what are you doing?

24:28.954 --> 24:31.113
Aw, are you okay, sweetie?

24:31.190 --> 24:32.982
Oh, nice pee close-up, Camera B.

24:33.059 --> 24:34.253
Jeremy, get in there!

24:34.330 --> 24:35.684
It's okay.

24:35.761 --> 24:37.256
You don't have to be embarrassed.

24:37.333 --> 24:38.891
- Put the camera down, man!
- Quinn!

24:38.968 --> 24:41.160
Put that camera down,
and you'll never pick one up

24:41.237 --> 24:42.958
- on this show again.
- Rachel!

24:43.035 --> 24:43.632
What are you doing?!

24:43.709 --> 24:45.482
I didn't have anything to do with this.

24:46.539 --> 24:48.434
- He's still there!
- Get him away!

24:48.511 --> 24:50.032
Riley!

24:50.109 --> 24:51.671
Oh, my God! Riley!

24:51.748 --> 24:53.177
Riley!

24:56.115 --> 24:57.281
Riley!

25:00.920 --> 25:01.947
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

25:02.024 --> 25:04.246
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

25:04.323 --> 25:06.974
- You're fine. Everything's fine.
- We got you.

25:08.961 --> 25:10.427
Come here.

25:11.564 --> 25:14.026
All right, we're gonna
cross the street, okay?

25:14.103 --> 25:15.928
Good. Everything's all right.

25:16.005 --> 25:17.760
I got you.

25:17.837 --> 25:19.899
Quinn, how could you do that?
I mean, seriously?

25:19.976 --> 25:21.934
After everything
that's happened on this show?

25:22.011 --> 25:23.332
The kid is fine.

25:23.409 --> 25:25.604
You used her one pathological fear.

25:25.681 --> 25:28.170
It was a clown! All right?

25:28.247 --> 25:30.285
I didn't know she was gonna go
running into the street,

25:30.353 --> 25:33.746
- like some scared Chihuahua.
- Quinn, she could have died.

25:33.823 --> 25:37.012
But she didn't, okay?
Besides, I don't understand.

25:37.089 --> 25:39.819
Whatever happened to, like,
facing our fears, okay?

25:39.896 --> 25:41.787
I'm so sick and tired of all this

25:41.864 --> 25:43.852
overprotective parent crap!

25:43.929 --> 25:45.554
I grew up without a mother,

25:45.631 --> 25:47.493
your mother is a certified psycho,

25:47.570 --> 25:49.016
and we are fine.

25:50.002 --> 25:51.293
Most days.

25:51.370 --> 25:52.440
All right? And look at them.

25:52.508 --> 25:54.266
They are a beautiful family.

25:54.343 --> 25:56.736
I got all of her mama juices flowing.

25:56.813 --> 25:57.966
I did that.

25:58.043 --> 26:00.093
I did what you couldn't do.

26:02.882 --> 26:05.120
- Hey. Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah, of course.

26:05.188 --> 26:07.242
- Hi. Sorry.
- Are you okay?

26:07.319 --> 26:08.981
Yeah, yeah. If you want, why don't we,

26:09.058 --> 26:11.517
like, push the goodbye
by like an hour, or...

26:11.594 --> 26:13.649
No. No, no. I-I want to stay.

26:13.726 --> 26:15.454
I can't just cut him after all that.

26:15.531 --> 26:17.656
I-I know it's crazy,
but the way that I felt

26:17.733 --> 26:20.656
when I saw Riley run into
the street, I just...

26:20.733 --> 26:22.862
Yeah, it was, like,
an amazing moment, for sure.

26:22.939 --> 26:25.728
But it was just one intense moment.

26:25.805 --> 26:28.397
And being a mother, it's...
you know, it's 24/7.

26:28.474 --> 26:29.795
I mean, nothing has
changed here, Serena.

26:29.863 --> 26:31.685
No, but it has.
That's what I'm trying to say.

26:31.754 --> 26:33.708
And maybe I can do the mom thing.

26:33.777 --> 26:35.983
I mean, the way that I felt
about Riley in that moment,

26:36.052 --> 26:38.919
I-I'm not gonna just leave
that here in Colorado.

26:39.422 --> 26:41.052
Oh, yeah, okay.

26:41.320 --> 26:42.557
- Okay?
- I mean, yeah, of course.

26:42.625 --> 26:44.118
- It's your choice, so...
- Okay.

26:57.859 --> 27:01.064
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. This is amazing.

27:01.141 --> 27:02.498
Give it to me.

27:02.575 --> 27:03.575
Yeah.

27:05.608 --> 27:08.158
This is fantastic!

27:10.580 --> 27:12.329
Give it to me. Give it to me.

27:16.019 --> 27:18.715
Brazil street dance is the best!

27:18.792 --> 27:23.920
It's a mixture of samba, drums...

27:23.997 --> 27:25.351
and sex.

27:25.428 --> 27:27.423
You are unbelievable.

27:27.500 --> 27:28.896
Come here.

27:37.907 --> 27:40.499
- Help me!
- No! She can't help you!

27:40.576 --> 27:43.069
No! I can't help you! I can't help you!

27:43.146 --> 27:45.237
See? That is called a story arc, Rachel.

27:45.314 --> 27:46.576
She wasn't into it at first,

27:46.653 --> 27:48.040
but now she is.

27:48.117 --> 27:50.243
Well, I'm glad you're happy.
I hope it was worth it.

27:50.312 --> 27:52.321
What... Worth what? Doing my job?

27:52.390 --> 27:54.914
Or doing your job, actually?

27:55.187 --> 27:57.750
You scarred that little girl for life.

27:57.834 --> 27:59.204
She's gonna be getting teased

27:59.273 --> 28:00.428
about pissing her pants in college.

28:00.496 --> 28:01.830
I mean, do you want to just, like,

28:01.898 --> 28:03.501
set up her therapy fund right now?

28:03.570 --> 28:05.049
Just get over it.

28:07.270 --> 28:08.995
Did Fiona put you up to this?

28:09.398 --> 28:11.200
She doesn't even work in reality TV.

28:11.277 --> 28:13.136
She has no idea what we do.

28:13.213 --> 28:15.605
No one puts me up to anything.

28:15.682 --> 28:18.070
Right. Right.

28:18.147 --> 28:20.076
They are kissing. That is your guy.

28:20.153 --> 28:22.578
You should be thanking me.

28:22.936 --> 28:24.415
Thanks, Quinn.

28:29.425 --> 28:30.950
Hey, Quinn.

28:31.320 --> 28:32.752
I have some really great news.

28:32.999 --> 28:35.743
While everyone was away,
I got August, Jasper, and Zach

28:35.812 --> 28:38.548
to compete in a dig-off
for Serena, and August won.

28:38.617 --> 28:41.027
What the hell is a dig-off?
That sounds ridiculous.

28:41.104 --> 28:43.212
I mean, it's a little caveman macho,

28:43.281 --> 28:45.374
but I got some really great
footage of the guys.

28:45.469 --> 28:47.348
- Look.
- Okay.

28:48.845 --> 28:50.882
Hi. Uh, yeah, this is Rachel Goldberg.

28:50.951 --> 28:52.463
I'm calling for my father.

28:54.283 --> 28:56.088
Okay, well, can you just
tell him that I called

28:56.156 --> 28:57.399
and I'll try again later?

28:57.468 --> 28:58.555
Thank you.

28:58.624 --> 29:00.618
Hey! Where are you going?

29:00.687 --> 29:02.424
You got to get to the network
with that footage.

29:02.492 --> 29:04.533
T-They're gonna cream in their
jeans when they see that.

29:04.601 --> 29:06.419
You just bought us season 16!

29:06.496 --> 29:07.966
So, you're really okay with all of this?

29:08.034 --> 29:09.926
Yes, absolutely.
What are you talking about?

29:10.003 --> 29:12.725
Do you know what Quinn did
to get that footage?

29:12.802 --> 29:14.660
She made a little girl piss herself.

29:14.737 --> 29:17.133
Well, listen, these things
happen with children.

29:17.210 --> 29:18.664
Quinn made it happen.

29:18.741 --> 29:22.568
She deliberately terrified
a 6-year-old who almost died.

29:22.645 --> 29:24.516
I mean, how would you feel
if that was your kid?

29:24.584 --> 29:26.764
Rachel, what are you talking about?

29:36.092 --> 29:39.455
Mud wrestling... we haven't
done that before.

29:39.712 --> 29:42.538
Yeah. We can use this, Madison.

29:42.716 --> 29:44.604
Good job.

29:44.673 --> 29:46.493
I kinda promised that

29:46.562 --> 29:48.306
whoever won would get
a one-on-one date with Serena.

29:48.374 --> 29:51.321
Mm. Well, you kinda shouldn't
make promises you can't keep.

29:51.390 --> 29:52.577
No one-on-one dates without my say-so.

29:52.645 --> 29:55.004
Okay, but, you know that August
isn't even my guy, right?

29:55.256 --> 29:56.681
Look, I'm totally a team player.

29:56.750 --> 29:59.078
I will help anyone on the team.

29:59.742 --> 30:01.099
Fine. Okay?

30:01.176 --> 30:02.837
August can have a few minutes to grovel,

30:02.914 --> 30:04.973
- but that is it, all right?
- Okay, thank you.

30:05.050 --> 30:07.263
Now go wave your pom-poms
somewhere else.

30:08.216 --> 30:11.509
Just find out who put up these
peacocks! I hate them!

30:11.586 --> 30:12.647
Hey! Quinn! Quinnie!

30:12.724 --> 30:14.112
Is it true what I heard?

30:14.189 --> 30:15.984
Did you scare that kid on purpose?

30:16.061 --> 30:17.815
Is the kid okay? Yes.

30:17.892 --> 30:19.450
Is the footage great? Yes.

30:19.527 --> 30:20.689
What was it, Fiona's idea?

30:20.766 --> 30:22.320
Oh, grow up, Chet.

30:22.397 --> 30:24.656
Hey, I'm all grown up, Quinn. But you?

30:24.733 --> 30:26.503
You know, I did what I had
to do for the show.

30:26.571 --> 30:28.192
And everything was fine.

30:28.269 --> 30:30.999
You don't get it, do you?
You crossed a line.

30:31.076 --> 30:33.665
Oh! Suddenly there's a line?

30:33.742 --> 30:36.634
Yes. And if you were a mother,
you'd understand.

30:36.711 --> 30:38.636
If you had children of your own,

30:38.713 --> 30:40.997
you never would've done
something like that.

30:42.384 --> 30:44.842
You're right. I am not a mother.

30:44.919 --> 30:48.471
So how could I possibly know
if you're a good father?

30:49.891 --> 30:51.228
Guess you'll have to find someone else

30:51.296 --> 30:53.054
to speak at your visitation hearing.

30:53.131 --> 30:54.956
No. Don't do that. Hey, Quinn.

30:55.033 --> 30:56.033
Quinn!

30:59.574 --> 31:01.224
Please don't do this.

31:06.828 --> 31:07.999
Hey, Serena.

31:08.068 --> 31:10.492
- Yeah?
- Hi. Uh, you're needed on set.

31:10.569 --> 31:11.944
For what?

31:12.021 --> 31:13.524
I think you're probably
gonna want to come

31:13.592 --> 31:14.883
and see this for yourself.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.773
- Okay.
- Yeah.

31:23.098 --> 31:25.090
What's going on?

31:25.167 --> 31:27.363
You... You brought me out here
to look at a hole?

31:27.440 --> 31:29.594
No. It's a water infiltration pit.

31:29.671 --> 31:31.129
Or, at least, it will be.

31:31.206 --> 31:33.569
See, this will make the mansion
more sustainable.

31:33.646 --> 31:34.967
Oh.

31:35.044 --> 31:38.307
And it was Madison's idea
to bring you here.

31:38.384 --> 31:39.638
Not mine.

31:39.715 --> 31:42.077
'Cause you're just... not interested.

31:42.154 --> 31:45.210
Of course I'm interested, Serena.

31:45.287 --> 31:47.349
But... whatever happens between us,

31:47.426 --> 31:49.306
that's... that's up to you now.

31:50.392 --> 31:52.254
I just want to use my time
left on the show

31:52.331 --> 31:53.576
for something good.

31:55.064 --> 31:56.555
Yo!

31:56.632 --> 31:58.223
I dug a hole, too!

31:58.300 --> 32:00.692
Okay, let me see your hole.

32:00.769 --> 32:02.728
Size doesn't matter, right?

32:02.805 --> 32:04.463
Look, I gave this hole everything I got,

32:04.532 --> 32:06.511
'cause I want to show you
how serious I am about you.

32:06.579 --> 32:08.003
Not as a friend...

32:08.080 --> 32:09.772
but as a lover.

32:09.849 --> 32:11.178
As a man.

32:13.615 --> 32:16.045
Do you even know what
an infiltration pit is?

32:16.122 --> 32:17.309
Does it matter?

32:17.386 --> 32:19.014
Look, I got 3.8 million followers.

32:19.091 --> 32:22.017
I could tweet this out,
we'll have holes everywhere.

32:22.094 --> 32:23.419
Whack-a-mole nation.

32:23.496 --> 32:25.050
Actually, I, uh...

32:25.127 --> 32:26.898
I promised Quinn that
we'd get back to the mansion.

32:26.966 --> 32:29.525
We got to prep
for the elimination ceremony.

32:29.602 --> 32:31.823
- Cool.
- Well, thank you...

32:31.900 --> 32:33.204
Yeah, of course. You
like it, though, right?

32:33.272 --> 32:33.896
For your holes.

32:33.973 --> 32:35.364
Really, really great holes, guys.

32:35.441 --> 32:37.721
You love me for my holes, eh?

32:42.845 --> 32:43.944
Come in.

32:45.581 --> 32:48.977
Hey, Owen. Can I talk
to you for a second?

32:49.054 --> 32:51.613
You want to apologize?

32:51.690 --> 32:54.413
Look.

32:54.490 --> 32:56.485
I had no idea about
that whole clown thing.

32:56.562 --> 32:58.683
You expect me to buy that?

32:58.760 --> 33:01.299
That's her one fear, Rachel. That
clown didn't just show up on its own.

33:01.367 --> 33:03.101
I know. And I would do
anything to protect Riley.

33:03.169 --> 33:06.224
Which is why I wanted to talk to you.

33:06.301 --> 33:08.263
Look, what Serena did, that was amazing.

33:08.340 --> 33:09.998
I mean, the woman's incredible.

33:10.075 --> 33:14.566
But... I really don't think
that she's ready to be a mom.

33:14.643 --> 33:16.234
You think I couldn't see that?

33:16.311 --> 33:17.940
You know, when I got back from Iraq,

33:18.017 --> 33:19.775
I had a baby dropped in my lap.

33:19.852 --> 33:22.607
I didn't feel it, either. I panicked.

33:22.684 --> 33:24.288
Thought about dropping her off
with my sister

33:24.356 --> 33:25.747
and asking her to raise her.

33:25.824 --> 33:27.516
But I grew into it.

33:27.593 --> 33:29.581
And so will Serena.

33:29.658 --> 33:31.374
And what if she doesn't?

33:33.495 --> 33:35.299
Look, I'm just saying, I had
a complicated relationship

33:35.367 --> 33:36.988
with my own mother, and...

33:37.065 --> 33:39.795
Serena dove in front of a truck
to save my daughter, Rachel.

33:39.872 --> 33:42.197
- That's the kind of person that she is.
- I know.

33:42.274 --> 33:45.300
And besides, she has so many
other amazing qualities.

33:45.377 --> 33:47.165
She has an incredible career,

33:47.242 --> 33:50.068
she travels all over the world,
she goes after what she wants.

33:50.145 --> 33:52.049
Do you have any idea what
having a role model like that

33:52.117 --> 33:54.710
- would do for Riley?
- A role model, yes, but...

33:54.787 --> 33:57.142
Families are all different, Rachel.

33:57.219 --> 33:59.715
I believe that Serena will get there.

33:59.792 --> 34:03.515
And until then, I can be mom
enough for both of us.

34:03.592 --> 34:07.356
Look, I know that doesn't sound
manly or whatever, but...

34:07.433 --> 34:09.078
No, it, um...

34:11.600 --> 34:13.683
sounds really beautiful.

34:22.543 --> 34:24.034
Hi.

34:24.112 --> 34:26.705
So, how was your time on the frontier?

34:26.782 --> 34:28.840
It was actually kind of incredible.

34:28.917 --> 34:31.213
I can really see what a life
there would look like.

34:31.290 --> 34:32.610
Mm.

34:32.688 --> 34:34.516
A life in the-middle-of-nowhere Colorado

34:34.592 --> 34:36.217
only seems like a good idea now

34:36.295 --> 34:39.321
because you've been stuck in
this hellhole of a mansion.

34:39.398 --> 34:41.924
Don't kid yourself.
It'd never be enough.

34:42.001 --> 34:43.321
It's just...

34:43.398 --> 34:44.688
It's not who you are.

34:44.766 --> 34:46.161
You know, maybe it's worth

34:46.237 --> 34:49.097
giving up a lifestyle
to find a real connection.

34:49.174 --> 34:50.629
Mm.

34:50.706 --> 34:53.022
And who says you have to choose?

34:55.811 --> 34:57.527
Why don't you have both?

34:59.314 --> 35:00.943
You think that's what we have?

35:01.020 --> 35:02.765
A real connection?

35:04.419 --> 35:05.736
You tell me.

35:05.805 --> 35:08.935
- Where is Alexi? Do you know?
- My darling sunflower!

35:09.076 --> 35:10.997
Finally you came back to me.

35:11.066 --> 35:13.158
This place is so depressing without you.

35:13.360 --> 35:14.932
- I'm sorry if I'm late.
- Wish murder was legal.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.767
- Copy that.
- Some things are worth waiting for.

35:16.835 --> 35:18.323
Stop kissing her ass!

35:18.400 --> 35:22.018
All right, people, let's go!
Let's go! Action already!

35:23.138 --> 35:25.234
Oh, nice of you to show up.

35:25.311 --> 35:27.134
Yeah, sorry. I just...

35:27.319 --> 35:31.279
Gentlemen, we only have
four golden key rings,

35:31.513 --> 35:33.609
which means one of you
will leave tonight

35:33.728 --> 35:35.876
without having unlocked Serena's heart.

35:36.111 --> 35:40.545
This was... a very tough decision.

35:40.622 --> 35:42.951
And it honestly pains me
to know that one of you

35:43.028 --> 35:44.369
will be going home today.

35:44.830 --> 35:46.918
Owen, I had an incredible time

35:46.995 --> 35:48.890
with you and Riley in Frontier Creek.

35:48.967 --> 35:50.926
And I will always treasure it.

35:51.003 --> 35:53.850
See? I made a perfect family, Rachel.

35:55.337 --> 35:56.653
Thanks for coming.

35:58.307 --> 36:00.565
- Jasper.
- Boom!

36:00.798 --> 36:02.423
You've given me a lot to think about,

36:02.492 --> 36:04.940
and I hope we can
continue our conversation

36:05.017 --> 36:06.629
moving forward.

36:09.484 --> 36:14.182
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
is what I call a horse race.

36:14.384 --> 36:15.634
Alexi.

36:15.703 --> 36:19.142
You know how much I love
your creativity and passion.

36:19.264 --> 36:21.189
I hope I get to see more of it.

36:21.431 --> 36:24.158
"Creativity." That's a good word for it.

36:24.227 --> 36:27.023
Serena, this is the last
key ring of the night.

36:27.114 --> 36:29.169
Dun-dun-dun!

36:29.371 --> 36:31.596
Two men left.

36:31.673 --> 36:33.231
One, a close friend,

36:33.308 --> 36:35.704
and the other, a challenging lover.

36:35.781 --> 36:37.736
Ugh! Graham! Gross!

36:37.813 --> 36:39.063
Thank you, Graham.

36:40.148 --> 36:41.239
Zach.

36:41.316 --> 36:42.807
Oh. Don't do it.

36:42.884 --> 36:45.644
I have had such a good time with you.

36:45.721 --> 36:48.513
But I didn't come on this show
just to have fun.

36:48.590 --> 36:50.582
I came here to look for a husband.

36:50.659 --> 36:52.988
I just don't see that being
in the cards for us.

36:53.065 --> 36:54.656
So, it's... it's this guy?

36:54.733 --> 36:56.187
Come on.

36:56.264 --> 36:57.756
The fireman's cool.

36:57.833 --> 36:59.294
But the rest of 'em?

36:59.371 --> 37:01.459
You got an Australian douche,

37:01.536 --> 37:04.629
you got a Russian douche,
you got a British douche.

37:04.706 --> 37:06.702
You got the United Nations
of douche-Dom here.

37:06.779 --> 37:08.804
I mean, come on. He's not wrong.

37:08.881 --> 37:11.503
I'm telling you, fun is underrated.

37:11.580 --> 37:13.909
In 10 years, you're gonna
come crawling back.

37:13.986 --> 37:15.965
I might just take you.

37:18.687 --> 37:20.716
Where has that been all season?

37:20.793 --> 37:23.085
Oh, now I wish we could keep him.

37:23.162 --> 37:26.054
I wasn't leaving without doing that.

37:26.131 --> 37:27.844
All right, douches.

37:33.101 --> 37:36.098
Hey, it's, uh... Charlie, right?

37:36.175 --> 37:37.629
That depends.

37:37.706 --> 37:39.234
You are consistently getting footage

37:39.311 --> 37:41.466
that my male D.P.s can't.

37:41.543 --> 37:43.872
I mean, they have zero problem
shooting tits and ass,

37:43.949 --> 37:45.874
but when it comes to
lighting a dick shadow,

37:45.951 --> 37:48.473
they don't know squat.

37:48.550 --> 37:50.033
So good work.

37:52.487 --> 37:54.379
Wow.

37:54.456 --> 37:57.916
Last time that Quinn
gave me a compliment was...

37:57.993 --> 38:00.398
Oh, yeah, that's right... never,
'cause I've never gotten one.

38:00.466 --> 38:01.688
Ever.

38:01.916 --> 38:03.874
Did you and Rachel have fun at prom?

38:04.132 --> 38:05.436
Whoa. What are you talking about?

38:05.504 --> 38:08.029

38:08.106 --> 38:09.260

38:11.673 --> 38:15.033
I don't care if you still have
drama going on with her.

38:15.110 --> 38:17.026
I'm just not gonna be a part of it.

38:19.080 --> 38:22.665
P.S., it didn't suck being stuck
in a house full of hot guys.

38:25.253 --> 38:27.011
Yeah.

38:27.088 --> 38:29.551
Thanks for letting me know.

38:29.628 --> 38:31.783
I will.

38:31.860 --> 38:33.718
Look, I know what you're gonna say.

38:33.795 --> 38:35.724
You're gonna say that I'm being blamey,

38:35.801 --> 38:37.956
but Quinn manipulated this entire thing.

38:38.024 --> 38:39.943
- And the worst part is... it's worked!
- Rachel.

38:40.011 --> 38:41.435
- Rachel...
- So what the hell do I know

38:41.503 --> 38:43.216
- about creating a family?
- Rachel!

38:43.285 --> 38:44.677

last week, and I loved it.

worked like gangbusters.

This is how awards campaigns
are born, my friend.

40:56.403 --> 40:58.533
The story was really Quinn's idea.

40:58.629 --> 41:01.733
Just wanted to go for some
deeper material.

41:01.810 --> 41:04.639
It's not about the content.
It's about the campaign.

41:04.716 --> 41:07.176
Now, lucky for you,
I have deep pockets...

41:07.245 --> 41:10.676

41:21.543 --> 41:24.067

thing she has ever done.
