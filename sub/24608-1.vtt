01:12.398 --> 01:15.233
What, what is it, huh?

01:24.110 --> 01:26.744
God has taken him.
We will pray for him.

01:26.745 --> 01:29.314
No... No, no, no, no, give him to me.

01:29.415 --> 01:31.916
I'm sorry, my love.

01:37.289 --> 01:39.591
No, no, no...

01:39.592 --> 01:41.392
Shh, shh, shh...

01:41.393 --> 01:44.529
What are you doing, brother?

01:49.034 --> 01:51.536
He sounds very angry.

01:57.443 --> 02:00.445
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost,

02:00.446 --> 02:04.582
I baptize thee José Francisco
de Paula Juan Nepomuceno

02:04.583 --> 02:11.122
María de los Remedios Cipriano de la
Santísima Trinidad Ruiz y Picasso.

02:13.340 --> 02:14.440
_

03:09.548 --> 03:11.816
Ole!

03:15.654 --> 03:17.689
You see how brave the matador is?

03:17.690 --> 03:21.159
But what if the bull kills him, Papa?

03:21.327 --> 03:25.223
He is an artist, Pablito,
and he is willing to risk his life to

03:25.224 --> 03:26.831
do something truly beautiful.

03:27.833 --> 03:30.668
Ole!

03:42.715 --> 03:45.316
It doesn't look right.

03:45.451 --> 03:46.985
Nonsense.

03:46.986 --> 03:48.519
You're a great artist.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.222
One day, your paintings will
be on the walls of the Prado.

03:51.223 --> 03:53.191
Maybe I should be a soldier.

03:53.192 --> 03:55.159
Well, then you will be general.

03:55.160 --> 03:57.395
And if you're a priest,
you will be Pope.

04:01.033 --> 04:03.167
Look what our Pablo has done, Papa.

04:03.168 --> 04:06.738
Hmm? Oh!

04:07.506 --> 04:09.507
My horse doesn't look real, Papa.

04:09.508 --> 04:11.643
Not like your pigeons.

04:11.644 --> 04:14.545
I want to paint like you.

04:14.713 --> 04:18.149
Then I will teach you, Pablito. Hmm?

04:27.293 --> 04:29.894
You are a genius, Maya.

04:31.997 --> 04:34.098
A true surrealist.

04:37.069 --> 04:40.872
Look. Mi papá taught
me how to paint pigeons.

04:41.573 --> 04:43.441
What do you think?

04:45.944 --> 04:47.278
Maya, no!

04:47.279 --> 04:49.514
Papa's paintings are very precious.

04:49.948 --> 04:51.582
Oh, well, you know.

04:51.583 --> 04:54.185
She's a critic, the only
one I have ever loved.

04:55.254 --> 04:58.055
I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you.
I'm gonna get you.

05:04.763 --> 05:07.165
She is so happy
when you are here, Pablo.

05:07.166 --> 05:08.733
Can't you stay the night?

05:08.734 --> 05:11.602
Marie-Therese,
you know I have to work.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.404
You can work here.

05:13.405 --> 05:16.774
No... with this little
devil savage, you know, my ideas...

05:16.775 --> 05:18.843
But I'll be back next week.

05:18.844 --> 05:20.778
Hmm.

05:32.725 --> 05:35.393
The roses are exquisite, Hervé.

05:35.394 --> 05:36.494
Thank you, monsieur.

05:36.495 --> 05:39.630
Cut me a stem, would you?

05:42.568 --> 05:46.337
You should let them grow wild, too
much pruning destroys, uh, beauty.

05:47.172 --> 05:50.375
Yes, monsieur.

05:50.376 --> 05:52.009
Vamanos, Marcel.

05:52.010 --> 05:55.313
To Grands-Augustins?

05:55.547 --> 05:57.682
I want to make a stop, first.

06:12.631 --> 06:14.365
You frightened me.

06:15.834 --> 06:19.203
Nonsense. You're fearless.

06:20.172 --> 06:22.640
You're experimenting
with double prints again.

06:22.641 --> 06:24.709
What do you think?

06:24.710 --> 06:27.694
You're a brilliant photographer,

06:27.695 --> 06:29.838
Dora, but there is a painter

06:30.349 --> 06:32.550
trapped inside of you.

06:32.551 --> 06:34.819
Oh?

06:35.587 --> 06:38.022
You should set her free.

06:39.625 --> 06:42.393
Well, perhaps I will.

06:44.196 --> 06:46.030
There are thorns.

06:46.031 --> 06:48.699
Be careful.

06:49.868 --> 06:52.570
Never.

07:01.046 --> 07:02.844
We need a passionate statement from

07:02.845 --> 07:04.415
you, Pablo, something to capture the

07:04.416 --> 07:06.250
world's attention.

07:06.251 --> 07:08.185
What do you have in mind?

07:11.356 --> 07:15.827
We want you to make a painting
to fill this entire wall of the

07:15.828 --> 07:20.498
Spanish Pavilion at the
Universal Exposition.

07:21.600 --> 07:24.368
I have never made
a painting that large.

07:24.369 --> 07:26.771
I wouldn't know where to begin.

07:29.208 --> 07:32.944
Franco and his fanatics are
winning the war in our beloved Spain,

07:33.212 --> 07:36.080
spilling the blood of
those who defend democracy.

07:36.515 --> 07:38.716
Fascism's spreading
across the continent.

07:38.717 --> 07:40.976
The threat is enormous, so the picture

07:40.977 --> 07:43.311
itself must be enormous
to move the public.

07:43.622 --> 07:46.190
Tens of thousands of people
will attend the exposition;

07:46.191 --> 07:48.960
from the rest of Europe, from America.

07:48.961 --> 07:51.796
A bold artistic declaration
from Pablo Picasso,

07:51.797 --> 07:54.040
the most famous of
all Spanish artists,

07:54.041 --> 07:56.267
would alert the world
to our plight and

07:56.268 --> 07:59.570
help us raise awareness
and money to save the Republic.

08:00.172 --> 08:04.742
Franco has Hitler and
the Nazis on his side, Pablo.

08:07.479 --> 08:11.048
We need you on ours.

08:12.584 --> 08:15.019
How can you refuse?

08:15.020 --> 08:17.288
I don't take commissions!

08:17.389 --> 08:21.292
I paint what I want and what I feel,
not what someone else tells me to!

08:21.894 --> 08:24.228
This is a chance to
make a real difference.

08:24.229 --> 08:26.931
Even if I had an idea, which I don't,

08:26.932 --> 08:29.100
a picture is not going to stop a war,

08:29.735 --> 08:32.003
no matter how gigantic it is.

08:32.004 --> 08:35.039
It could move people to stand
against fascism and violence.

08:35.274 --> 08:38.109
But I am not a poster artist, anyway.

08:38.477 --> 08:41.345
I don't make propaganda.

08:44.416 --> 08:46.017
Do you want to know what I think?

08:46.018 --> 08:47.652
No!

08:49.922 --> 08:53.324
But I am certain that you're
going to tell me, anyway.

08:56.395 --> 08:58.796
I think you are scared...

08:58.797 --> 09:00.164
Mm-hmm.

09:00.165 --> 09:02.233
Scared? Of what?

09:02.234 --> 09:04.045
Scared that if you make such a

09:04.046 --> 09:06.337
gigantic painting and
it's met with silence,

09:06.338 --> 09:08.005
you will have failed...

09:08.006 --> 09:09.907
That's ridiculous.

09:09.908 --> 09:13.644
Or if it makes too much noise,
the fascists might come after you,

09:13.645 --> 09:17.948
and you might lose your
nice, easy bourgeois life.

09:19.051 --> 09:21.352
You live like a king, Pablo;

09:21.353 --> 09:24.021
with your fancy automobile
and your fancy apartment.

09:26.058 --> 09:29.860
What happened to the rebellious
young artist who used to spit in

09:29.861 --> 09:33.030
the face of authority?

09:33.031 --> 09:35.833
Where has he gone, hm?

09:42.274 --> 09:43.974
I want to see, Pablo!

09:44.409 --> 09:45.676
I want to try another one.

09:45.677 --> 09:47.044
Now, sit still.

09:47.045 --> 09:49.513
I can't.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.917
Come here.

09:57.356 --> 09:59.423
I look pretty!

09:59.558 --> 10:02.293
I draw what I see.

10:09.401 --> 10:12.570
You feel warm, Conchita.

10:13.238 --> 10:15.206
It's diphtheria.

10:15.207 --> 10:17.541
Please God, no.

10:17.542 --> 10:19.443
Is there anything to be done?

10:19.444 --> 10:22.613
There is a serum, but I
will have to send to Paris for it.

10:25.050 --> 10:27.551
Go back to bed, son.

10:27.552 --> 10:30.654
Everything is all right.

10:32.791 --> 10:36.761
Please, God, spare my
sister María de la Concepción.

10:37.796 --> 10:40.440
If you save her, I
will never again waste

10:40.441 --> 10:42.724
my time with painting and drawing.

10:46.371 --> 10:49.774
In Jesus's name, I swear it.

10:50.075 --> 10:52.326
To You, O Lord, we commend the soul

10:52.327 --> 10:54.502
of María de la Concepción,
Your servant.

10:56.448 --> 10:59.483
In the sight of this
world, she is now dead.

10:59.618 --> 11:03.154
In Your sight, may she live forever.

11:03.155 --> 11:04.874
Forgive whatever sins she

11:04.875 --> 11:07.258
committed and, in your goodness,

11:07.259 --> 11:10.327
grant her everlasting peace.

11:10.328 --> 11:14.465
We ask this through
Christ our Lord. Amen.

11:30.182 --> 11:32.583
You were a good brother to her.

11:34.152 --> 11:36.587
I killed her.

11:36.955 --> 11:39.824
Why would you say
such a horrible thing?

11:40.792 --> 11:44.528
I made a vow to God
that if he let Conchita live,

11:44.529 --> 11:47.264
I-I-I would give up painting...

11:47.265 --> 11:49.467
Oh, Pablo...

11:49.468 --> 11:52.837
But God knew I
could never keep my promise.

11:52.838 --> 11:56.473
I loved painting too much.

11:57.676 --> 12:04.114
Maybe more than I loved Conchita,
so to punish me he took her.

12:13.091 --> 12:16.160
God is not punishing you.

12:16.661 --> 12:18.999
He was telling you that you have a

12:19.000 --> 12:21.890
great gift, one that He has given you.

12:24.069 --> 12:28.806
He wants you to know that
you must never stop painting.

12:31.476 --> 12:34.011
Come back to bed.

12:34.012 --> 12:35.346
I can't.

12:35.347 --> 12:38.649
Mm, because you are too old?

12:39.117 --> 12:42.586
You know, it takes a
very long time to become young.

12:44.189 --> 12:46.323
Not now!

12:46.324 --> 12:48.325
Sorry to bother you, Pablo, but...

12:48.326 --> 12:51.061
What is it, Jaimé?

12:51.863 --> 12:56.066
"Guernica, the most ancient
town of the Basques was completely

12:56.067 --> 12:59.370
destroyed yesterday by
insurgent air raiders.

13:00.071 --> 13:04.575
A powerful fleet of airplanes
consisting of three German types,

13:04.576 --> 13:08.846
Junkers and Heinkel fighters, did
not cease unloading on the town.

13:09.915 --> 13:13.617
Bombs that targeted defenceless
citizens on a busy market day,

13:15.086 --> 13:18.255
levelling buildings and
setting roaring fires."

13:43.615 --> 13:48.085
"The fighters, meanwhile, plunged
low to machine-gun those of the

13:48.086 --> 13:51.922
civilian population who had
taken refuge in the fields."

14:03.835 --> 14:09.340
Women and children...
ripped to shreds!

14:12.944 --> 14:15.612
Those fascist bastards.

14:15.780 --> 14:19.650
Franco rode in with his Nazi pigs.

14:19.918 --> 14:23.954
They can't be allowed
to get away with this.

14:23.955 --> 14:28.125
They attacked your people.

14:35.533 --> 14:39.803
I know you didn't want to make a painting
for the Spanish Pavilion, Pablo,

14:41.640 --> 14:44.041
but now you must.

14:52.851 --> 14:56.053
I am going to need a...

14:56.054 --> 14:58.655
very big canvas.

16:26.702 --> 16:29.270
Where did you learn to draw like that?

16:29.271 --> 16:30.905
My father.

16:30.906 --> 16:32.941
How old are you, anyway?

16:32.942 --> 16:35.109
14.

16:35.277 --> 16:36.578
Jesus Christ.

16:36.579 --> 16:39.547
It's Pablo, actually. Pablo Ruiz.

16:39.548 --> 16:42.951
Manuel Pallarés.

16:43.719 --> 16:45.587
Well, maybe you're not Jesus,

16:45.588 --> 16:48.323
but the way that you shade
the folds of his skin,

16:48.457 --> 16:51.459
there is something
goddamn holy about it.

16:53.562 --> 16:56.998
To be honest, I'd, I'd rather
be drawing a beautiful woman's ass.

16:59.235 --> 17:02.170
You've never seen a
woman's ass before, have you?

17:03.372 --> 17:05.507
Five pesetas!

17:05.508 --> 17:07.837
To whichever one of
you wants to cure my

17:07.838 --> 17:10.299
young friend here of
his acute virginity.

17:29.665 --> 17:32.634
You can go now.

17:36.639 --> 17:39.307
Are you deaf?

17:39.308 --> 17:41.309
Can't, can't I look at you?

17:41.310 --> 17:43.011
You have done more than look.

17:43.012 --> 17:44.612
Now out with you.

17:44.613 --> 17:48.049
No. I mean, without your dress.

17:50.886 --> 17:54.222
Your friend didn't pay for that.

18:06.735 --> 18:10.071
That's not enough to
peek at even one bare thigh.

18:10.205 --> 18:12.674
Please, just for a moment.

18:12.675 --> 18:15.577
Oh, and that will be enough for you?

18:15.578 --> 18:19.047
Enough to remember what you look like.

18:21.350 --> 18:25.553
I am not so pretty in the light.

18:25.654 --> 18:28.323
Not anymore.

18:28.324 --> 18:30.992
I think you're very beautiful.

18:33.228 --> 18:35.063
You do, do you?

18:35.064 --> 18:40.702
Yes. And I want to paint you.

18:57.186 --> 18:59.988
It is extraordinary, Pablo.

18:59.989 --> 19:04.092
It's a gift, Uncle, to thank
you for everything you've done for me.

19:04.393 --> 19:07.028
And such a touching subject.

19:07.229 --> 19:10.098
It's a story
inspired by my sister's death.

19:10.099 --> 19:13.434
We are calling it "Science
and Charity." I sat for Pablo,

19:13.535 --> 19:17.038
but the figure of the doctor,
he's inspired by you, Brother.

19:17.106 --> 19:21.075
To think such a marvellous
work could come from such a young hand.

19:22.144 --> 19:24.946
Yes. Pablo has far exceeded his peers.

19:24.947 --> 19:28.483
There's nothing left for
him to learn in Barcelona.

19:29.151 --> 19:32.520
I'm hoping to study at
the Royal Academy in Madrid.

19:33.989 --> 19:36.624
But it's quite expensive.

19:37.793 --> 19:40.628
Now I see the charity
you allude to in the painting.

19:41.330 --> 19:44.535
I'm ashamed to ask for your
generosity again, Salvador, but...

19:44.536 --> 19:45.967
Nonsense.

19:45.968 --> 19:49.604
It will bring honor to the Ruiz name
to have a true artist in the family.

19:51.407 --> 19:56.778
You will not be an artist
until you have mastered the rules

19:58.180 --> 20:01.015
of linear perspective
and orthogonal lines,

20:01.150 --> 20:04.652
the laws of drawing
and precise contour.

20:05.788 --> 20:09.196
You will not be an
artist until you have

20:09.197 --> 20:12.350
copied the masters, studied anatomy,

20:14.697 --> 20:20.234
and learn the language of geometry.

20:34.917 --> 20:36.217
No, Ruiz.

20:36.218 --> 20:39.120
How many times must I tell you.

20:39.121 --> 20:41.189
Your technique is all wrong.

20:42.124 --> 20:44.492
I'm drawing what I see, Maestro.

20:45.394 --> 20:49.730
Well, then you
are seeing it incorrectly.

20:49.832 --> 20:53.367
You must use straight lines,

20:53.535 --> 20:57.171
so that your figure is properly

20:57.873 --> 21:02.176
proportioned and positioned.

21:05.380 --> 21:09.350
You have talent,
Ruiz, but no discipline.

21:11.386 --> 21:15.323
And without discipline, you will fail.

21:48.590 --> 21:50.558
Ruiz?

21:50.626 --> 21:52.693
Maestro.

21:52.694 --> 21:55.496
So, this is where
you've been spending your time.

21:55.497 --> 21:57.231
Yes.

21:57.232 --> 21:58.733
Or sketching at the Prado.

21:58.734 --> 22:02.436
And when was the
last time you attended class?

22:03.605 --> 22:05.740
You only teach rules and imitation.

22:05.741 --> 22:08.142
I want to do something original.

22:08.744 --> 22:09.944
Original?

22:09.945 --> 22:12.146
Unique.

22:14.116 --> 22:17.485
Your uncle has written
to inquire after your progress.

22:18.220 --> 22:19.353
What shall I tell him?

22:19.354 --> 22:20.755
Whatever you like.

22:20.756 --> 22:23.724
He knows even less about
painting than you do.

22:25.260 --> 22:27.495
He pays your bills, your tuition.

22:27.496 --> 22:29.430
What does that
have to do with anything?

22:29.431 --> 22:32.166
Do you suppose he will continue
to do so when I inform him that

22:32.167 --> 22:34.802
you have made a mockery
of his generosity?

22:39.074 --> 22:40.842
How could you humiliate me like this?

22:40.843 --> 22:42.343
Degrain is a fraud.

22:42.344 --> 22:44.011
His approval could
have won you commissions.

22:44.012 --> 22:45.947
I don't want to paint
what everyone else tells me to.

22:45.948 --> 22:47.682
I want to be free to
paint what I like.

22:47.683 --> 22:49.750
Freedom is for rich men.

22:49.751 --> 22:51.052
You see how many
students I must take on,

22:51.053 --> 22:52.932
just to scratch out a meager living?

22:53.455 --> 22:55.990
Pablo.

22:56.525 --> 23:00.261
You could be a master at the Academy.

23:00.262 --> 23:02.029
You want me...

23:02.030 --> 23:05.466
You want me to be a teacher?

23:16.144 --> 23:19.547
I'm sorry, Papa.

23:22.017 --> 23:26.187
You, you have taught
me all I need to know.

23:26.555 --> 23:30.024
That's why I don't
need any more school.

23:32.728 --> 23:35.630
I can barely feed
your mother and her sisters.

23:35.631 --> 23:38.966
And your uncle will not
give you another peseta.

23:38.967 --> 23:40.368
What will you live on?

23:40.369 --> 23:42.336
I don't know.

23:42.337 --> 23:46.340
But I would rather starve than let
someone force me to paint inside a box.

23:46.842 --> 23:49.977
I am going to be a great
artist one day, Papa.

23:51.847 --> 23:56.210
But I will do it in my own way.

24:09.920 --> 24:12.855
Spain is at war with America.

24:12.856 --> 24:15.958
Every able-bodied man
must report for duty.

24:17.427 --> 24:20.529
We must protect our colonies:

24:20.597 --> 24:24.433
Cuba, Guam, Puerto Rico,
the Philippines.

24:25.202 --> 24:27.269
We must defend the empire.

24:27.270 --> 24:29.972
Report for duty.

24:42.119 --> 24:44.120
Well, if it
isn't the prodigal Pablito.

24:44.121 --> 24:46.488
Manuel!

24:48.625 --> 24:51.026
You know, I thought you were
at the Academy in Madrid teaching

24:51.027 --> 24:53.562
everyone how to draw women's asses.

24:53.563 --> 24:56.866
I need somewhere to stay.

24:56.867 --> 24:58.968
I can do illustrations
to help pay the rent.

24:58.969 --> 25:00.636
You'd have to
pay the rent on your own.

25:00.637 --> 25:02.404
I'm going back to Horta.

25:02.405 --> 25:04.640
Horta? Why?

25:04.641 --> 25:08.344
I don't want to get ripped
to shreds by American bullets,

25:08.345 --> 25:11.960
or die of yellow fever in
some godforsaken Cuban ditch,

25:12.149 --> 25:14.817
just so the damned imperialists
can get cheap sugar for a coffee.

25:17.754 --> 25:19.688
You were drafted.

25:19.689 --> 25:22.625
You're lucky you're
not old enough, or tall enough.

25:24.995 --> 25:27.296
Won't they find you at home?

25:27.297 --> 25:29.331
I will go back
to the farm for supplies,

25:29.332 --> 25:32.635
then I'm camping in the
Santa Barbara Mountains.

25:32.636 --> 25:35.704
The Spanish army is far too lazy
to climb all the way up there.

25:35.705 --> 25:37.840
Let me come with you.

25:37.841 --> 25:40.376
Please, please, Manuel.

25:40.377 --> 25:43.779
I can't go crawling back to my father.

25:54.705 --> 25:56.472
Just over the next rise.

25:56.473 --> 25:58.708
That's what you
said after the last rise.

26:26.903 --> 26:28.638
P. Ruiz.

26:28.639 --> 26:30.973
No.

26:32.943 --> 26:35.411
P. Ruiz y Picasso.

26:35.412 --> 26:39.148
No. What is wrong with just Ruiz?

26:40.951 --> 26:43.285
It's so damn common.

26:45.989 --> 26:47.657
It's also your father's name.

26:47.658 --> 26:49.992
Exactly.

26:49.993 --> 26:51.427
I need my own.

26:51.428 --> 26:52.962
Something people will remember.

26:52.963 --> 26:54.430
I tried my other names...

26:54.431 --> 26:56.666
Diego José-Ruiz, Juan-Nepomuceno.

26:56.667 --> 26:59.001
You don't strike me as a Nepomuceno.

26:59.002 --> 27:02.538
What do I strike you as?

27:04.508 --> 27:06.175
I know you, Pablo.

27:06.176 --> 27:09.011
You're not gonna let me or anyone
else tell you who you are.

27:20.691 --> 27:22.391
It's perfect, isn't it?

27:22.392 --> 27:24.393
Yes.

27:27.497 --> 27:31.167
And someday I'm going to
paint the perfect painting.

27:39.643 --> 27:42.178
That sounds stupid, doesn't it?

27:44.214 --> 27:46.182
No.

27:46.183 --> 27:48.717
It sounds quite brilliant actually.

27:51.555 --> 27:52.922
Let's never go back.

27:52.923 --> 27:54.490
What?

27:54.491 --> 27:55.991
We have everything we need here.

27:55.992 --> 27:58.361
Food from my family's farm,
nature, art, friendship.

27:58.362 --> 27:59.729
What about girls?

27:59.730 --> 28:01.397
There's a whorehouse in Gandesa.

28:03.100 --> 28:05.568
We could stay here.

28:05.702 --> 28:08.237
No rules, no teachers, no government.

28:09.206 --> 28:11.774
You could paint your
perfect painting, Pablo.

28:11.775 --> 28:13.542
Here.

28:23.320 --> 28:25.754
The paintings!

29:08.832 --> 29:12.067
These paintings, they were
the best work I've ever done.

29:12.469 --> 29:15.471
I'm so sorry, Pablo.

29:15.939 --> 29:18.674
The rains never come this early.

29:23.980 --> 29:25.614
It's a sign.

29:25.615 --> 29:28.017
A sign?

29:28.185 --> 29:30.786
Like when my sister died.

29:30.787 --> 29:34.857
God is telling me I'm
wasting my gift here.

29:38.795 --> 29:40.963
No, that's, that's crazy.

29:41.431 --> 29:43.499
We'll go back to the farm.

29:43.500 --> 29:46.302
We get more supplies and we come
back, this time, we build a shelter.

29:46.303 --> 29:48.804
No.

29:48.805 --> 29:51.621
If I stay here, even
if I paint the perfect

29:51.622 --> 29:54.133
painting, no one will ever look at it

29:54.511 --> 29:56.712
and see what I see.

29:56.713 --> 29:59.381
No one will know my name,
whatever the hell it is.

30:06.857 --> 30:12.027
And Conchita, she will
have died for nothing.

30:23.373 --> 30:26.075
Why have you stopped, Pablo?

30:35.185 --> 30:36.911
It's been so many years since I

30:36.912 --> 30:38.878
tried to make a painting
that tells a story.

30:42.192 --> 30:46.028
What if I cannot do it anymore?

30:47.330 --> 30:50.432
Of course you can.

30:51.034 --> 30:54.270
No, it's not
violent enough, it's not...

30:54.271 --> 30:56.839
angry enough.

30:56.840 --> 30:59.208
So make it angrier.

30:59.209 --> 31:02.278
I wasn't there.

31:02.279 --> 31:04.392
I don't know how the flames felt on

31:04.393 --> 31:06.939
their flesh, how their
screams sounded.

31:13.957 --> 31:15.224
I need to see him.

31:15.225 --> 31:16.559
He's working.

31:16.560 --> 31:18.027
He was supposed to come Tuesday.

31:18.028 --> 31:19.562
It's Thursday.

31:19.563 --> 31:21.096
You'll just have
to wait with everyone else.

31:21.097 --> 31:22.531
I need to see him.

31:22.532 --> 31:24.366
Mademoiselle, please.

31:24.367 --> 31:26.869
Please. Listen to me.

31:27.837 --> 31:30.105
I had an appointment for
an interview three hours ago.

31:30.106 --> 31:31.440
I know. Yes.

31:31.441 --> 31:33.309
Why does she get to go in?

31:33.310 --> 31:35.778
It is the same for everybody, sir.

31:35.779 --> 31:38.747
Pablo?

31:38.982 --> 31:40.449
Who is this woman, Pablo?

31:40.450 --> 31:42.251
Sorry, I told
her you were working, but...

31:42.252 --> 31:44.453
I am Dora Maar.

31:44.454 --> 31:46.922
And you must be Marie-Therese?

31:46.923 --> 31:49.091
Yes, the mother of his child.

31:49.092 --> 31:52.828
The woman he is going to marry.

31:55.732 --> 31:57.634
Perhaps you should pay a visit to

31:57.635 --> 31:59.659
his wife, the mother
of his other child,

32:00.403 --> 32:03.405
and inform her of this expectation.

32:04.608 --> 32:06.942
Tell this woman to leave.

32:06.943 --> 32:08.177
Now.

32:08.178 --> 32:09.812
I'm not going anywhere, Mademoiselle.

32:09.813 --> 32:11.447
One of us is leaving, Pablo.

32:11.448 --> 32:14.683
Which one, is up to you.

32:19.155 --> 32:22.091
You know what, you settle it.

32:22.859 --> 32:24.526
Yup.

32:30.533 --> 32:32.868
Ladies, ladies, please!

32:35.205 --> 32:37.840
Are you insane?

32:43.546 --> 32:45.647
You make us all look so lovely, Pablo.

32:46.316 --> 32:48.283
Will you do me next?

32:48.284 --> 32:50.984
If you let me stay another
night, I'll decorate your walls.

32:55.525 --> 32:57.709
It's not bad for a whorehouse

32:57.710 --> 32:59.652
sketch, but I've seen much better.

33:00.797 --> 33:01.864
Have you?

33:01.865 --> 33:03.165
Yes.

33:03.166 --> 33:06.168
Nonell, Casas, me.

33:07.637 --> 33:09.238
Oh, you're an artist, are you?

33:09.239 --> 33:12.141
Yes, and I see you're
trying to copy our style.

33:12.809 --> 33:15.210
You've obviously been
to Els Quatre Gats.

33:15.211 --> 33:18.414
I can't afford Els Quatre Gats.

33:18.415 --> 33:21.650
And I don't copy anyone's style.

33:22.419 --> 33:24.253
Are you going upstairs or not?

33:24.254 --> 33:25.654
Not.

33:25.655 --> 33:27.523
Out with you then.

33:27.524 --> 33:29.658
Oh what? You should come by some time.

33:29.659 --> 33:32.161
I'll buy you a beer. Huh?

33:32.896 --> 33:34.730
Let's go.

33:35.231 --> 33:37.833
My name is
Carles Casagemas, by the way.

33:37.834 --> 33:41.670
What is yours?

33:41.671 --> 33:43.438
Picasso.

33:54.516 --> 33:57.351
"Guernica, the most ancient
town of the Basques was

33:57.719 --> 34:00.521
completely destroyed by
insurgent air raiders."

34:03.024 --> 34:05.559
Ripped to shreds.

34:16.472 --> 34:18.069
Fascist bastards.

34:18.070 --> 34:20.304
They can't be allowed
to get away with this.

34:20.304 --> 34:23.174
What if the bull kills him, Papa?

34:33.185 --> 34:35.920
He's calling it "Guernica."

34:35.920 --> 34:37.788
Everybody's talking about it.

34:37.789 --> 34:44.228
It's brutal isn't it?

34:45.230 --> 34:47.764
Perhaps even ugly.

34:47.766 --> 34:49.652
I read that he said, "Painting

34:49.652 --> 34:51.391
is not meant to decorate apartments.

34:52.536 --> 34:54.938
It's meant to be a weapon."

34:55.739 --> 34:57.441
But there should be beauty in it,

34:57.442 --> 35:00.010
even when the subject is painful.

35:00.011 --> 35:03.013
I think it's powerful.

35:04.316 --> 35:07.785
As a work of propaganda, maybe.

35:08.453 --> 35:11.689
Perhaps you should
write a review, Francoise.

35:11.690 --> 35:13.673
I'm sure a scathing
critique of the greatest

35:13.674 --> 35:15.292
painter in the world will do wonders

35:15.293 --> 35:17.294
for your art career.

35:17.395 --> 35:19.964
Matisse is the greatest
painter in the world, Genevieve.

35:19.965 --> 35:21.232
Maybe.

35:21.233 --> 35:24.468
But Picasso is much better looking.

35:44.422 --> 35:46.490
Don't say you were at school.

35:46.491 --> 35:48.659
I phoned them.

35:50.395 --> 35:51.795
I went to the Exposition.

35:51.796 --> 35:54.165
You skipped class to what?

35:54.166 --> 35:56.514
Watch the boat races with some boy?

35:56.515 --> 35:58.783
No, I went with Genevieve,
to look at the architecture

35:58.784 --> 35:59.821
and the paintings.

35:59.822 --> 36:01.589
I don't understand you, Francoise.

36:01.590 --> 36:03.191
I have given you every opportunity.

36:03.192 --> 36:04.659
I want to be a painter.

36:04.660 --> 36:07.462
You think I raised
you to starve in Montmartre?

36:07.463 --> 36:09.264
Making caricatures
for English tourists?

36:09.265 --> 36:12.934
I won't. I'll do serious work.

36:13.636 --> 36:15.336
You will go to University.

36:15.337 --> 36:18.440
You will become a
lawyer or a professor.

36:18.441 --> 36:19.974
Do I make myself clear?

36:19.975 --> 36:22.477
Yes.

36:24.013 --> 36:27.482
Consider yourself
fortunate, Francoise.

36:27.883 --> 36:30.552
Not many fathers in this world expect
more from their daughters than

36:30.553 --> 36:32.887
to find a husband.

36:38.294 --> 36:40.328
Something funny?

36:40.863 --> 36:44.132
My good friend El Caudillo,
Generalissimo Francisco Franco,

36:44.400 --> 36:47.468
has just decreed that divorce
is no longer legal in Spain.

36:48.637 --> 36:51.339
Your painting must have
wounded him gravely, Pablo.

36:52.508 --> 36:55.176
Well, then it was worth the struggle.

36:55.845 --> 36:58.847
I'm proud of you, truly.

36:59.081 --> 37:00.720
You think he created a new

37:00.721 --> 37:02.574
national law just to get back at me?

37:02.752 --> 37:05.420
Your canvas was so big after all.

37:07.323 --> 37:09.166
Well, it will certainly make

37:09.167 --> 37:11.283
my wife want to get
up and dance again.

37:12.428 --> 37:14.529
No divorce in France,
no divorce in Spain.

37:15.264 --> 37:17.832
She can remain Madame Picasso
until the day she dies.

37:20.770 --> 37:23.037
Olga will be thrilled.

37:23.873 --> 37:26.124
But I'm afraid your poor Marie-Therese

37:26.125 --> 37:28.100
will be positively devastated.

37:33.182 --> 37:34.916
And you, my dear?

37:34.917 --> 37:38.953
Aren't you even a
little bit disappointed?

37:39.054 --> 37:43.091
Now you can never be
Madame Picasso either.

37:43.092 --> 37:45.894
I would never marry you.

37:45.961 --> 37:47.395
Wouldn't you?

37:47.396 --> 37:49.264
Of course not.

37:49.265 --> 37:51.122
Marriage is a bourgeois convention

37:51.123 --> 37:53.234
supported by priests and lawyers and,

37:53.235 --> 37:56.104
uh, fascist dictators.

37:59.842 --> 38:04.479
And besides, wives, by definition,
are boring creatures.

38:05.414 --> 38:09.217
Oh, I could never be bored by you.

38:19.128 --> 38:20.662
Where are you going?

38:20.663 --> 38:23.631
The light is perfect.

38:25.634 --> 38:29.170
No, let's go back to the hotel.

38:30.806 --> 38:33.474
I want to paint you.

38:48.090 --> 38:51.259
It is extraordinary, Pablo.

38:55.130 --> 38:58.032
Dora is whatever I need her to be;

38:58.267 --> 39:04.105
a mouse, a bird, an idea, a storm.

39:07.810 --> 39:10.678
She makes me wish I was 18 again.

39:25.561 --> 39:28.896
Well, if it isn't the
Leonardo da Vinci of the whorehouse!

39:29.965 --> 39:32.233
Come. Come have a drink.

39:33.235 --> 39:35.036
Toulouse-Lautrec is an inbred dwarf!

39:35.037 --> 39:37.639
Oh, Toulouse-Lautrec is a genius!

39:37.640 --> 39:39.407
Look at this.

39:39.408 --> 39:41.789
No one can touch him when it
comes to capturing real life.

39:42.011 --> 39:45.246
I think Nonell here
is just as good as Lautrec.

39:45.915 --> 39:47.248
Maybe better.

39:47.249 --> 39:49.650
Stop kissing my ass, Casagemas.

39:49.718 --> 39:51.719
You're going to give
me a venereal disease.

39:53.756 --> 39:56.024
You can't judge Lautrec
without seeing the colors.

39:56.025 --> 39:57.859
And to do that,
you have to go to Paris.

39:57.860 --> 39:59.727
If you're going
to Paris, forget Lautrec.

39:59.728 --> 40:02.063
See Degas, Cezanne.
Now there is a genius.

40:02.064 --> 40:03.831
You've been to Paris?

40:03.832 --> 40:06.868
He keeps a studio there.

40:08.904 --> 40:11.706
I'm going to Paris.

40:12.274 --> 40:14.609
Are you?

40:14.710 --> 40:18.046
Well, as soon as I can sell
enough work to afford a ticket.

40:19.915 --> 40:21.582
Don't laugh. He's very talented.

40:21.583 --> 40:23.184
I've seen his work.

40:23.185 --> 40:25.653
They're accepting submissions
for the Spanish Pavilion at the

40:25.654 --> 40:27.689
Paris Exposition next year.

40:27.690 --> 40:29.341
Paint something for that, Picasso.

40:29.342 --> 40:30.860
The only pictures chosen for that

40:30.861 --> 40:32.293
bourgeois pageant of
prettiness will be

40:32.294 --> 40:36.524
nauseating landscapes and dying saints
painted to please the tourists.

40:38.067 --> 40:40.101
Everyone stay where you are!

40:40.102 --> 40:42.136
Don't move! Stay in your seats!

40:44.606 --> 40:47.041
Come on. Come on.

40:51.146 --> 40:55.083
Hey! Hey! Hey!

40:57.987 --> 40:59.087
Faster!

40:59.088 --> 41:01.456
I'm trying.

41:04.760 --> 41:06.661
Hey.

41:08.097 --> 41:09.664
What the hell was that?

41:09.665 --> 41:11.599
They're rounding up anarchists.

41:11.600 --> 41:13.234
It happens two or three times a month.

41:13.235 --> 41:14.635
Are you an anarchist?

41:14.636 --> 41:16.938
Of course. And a Decadente.

41:16.939 --> 41:20.108
And a Catalaniste.

41:20.109 --> 41:21.342
Aren't you?

41:21.343 --> 41:23.511
I don't know much about politics.

41:23.512 --> 41:25.366
Well, if we're going to talk

41:25.367 --> 41:27.115
about politics, I need another drink.

41:31.520 --> 41:33.531
All government institutions

41:33.532 --> 41:35.423
must be abolished entirely and all

41:35.424 --> 41:38.659
systems of authority
vigorously opposed.

41:43.065 --> 41:46.000
Is this gouache and charcoal?

41:46.702 --> 41:49.337
Yes, it's much
less expensive than oils.

41:52.374 --> 41:55.109
I wish I had a place like this.

41:55.677 --> 41:57.678
Oh, you can work here if you want.

41:57.679 --> 41:59.847
Sleep here, too.

41:59.848 --> 42:02.717
There are no whores to keep you
company, but no bedbugs either.

42:08.557 --> 42:10.458
You've got a confident line, Picasso.

42:10.459 --> 42:11.959
Or should I call you,

42:11.960 --> 42:13.327
"le petit Goya."

42:13.328 --> 42:15.863
Goya? Goya's a rotting corpse.

42:16.131 --> 42:18.132
Picasso and I, we are the future.

42:18.133 --> 42:21.536
If you and your partners were
smart, you'd give us a show here.

42:22.337 --> 42:25.339
Have you got
anything for me to look at?

42:27.976 --> 42:29.177
What about you?

42:29.178 --> 42:30.878
How many of those have you done?

42:30.879 --> 42:33.548
Give me a museum, I'll fill it.

42:35.584 --> 42:38.419
"A young man,
almost a child, Picazzo..."

42:39.521 --> 42:40.988
He spelled your name wrong.

42:40.989 --> 42:42.741
Of course he did.

42:42.742 --> 42:45.877
"Picazzo displays an
extraordinary ease in his handling of

42:45.878 --> 42:47.212
a pencil and brush..."

42:47.213 --> 42:48.814
Mmm, that's excellent!

42:48.815 --> 42:51.516
"But as one examines the work,

42:51.517 --> 42:54.553
one notices mistakes,
lack of experience,

42:55.188 --> 42:57.689
and hesitation about
which path to follow.

42:58.257 --> 43:01.359
In order to achieve
personality in art,

43:01.360 --> 43:03.628
one must not base
it on that of others.

43:03.629 --> 43:05.997
One must take a different direction,

43:05.998 --> 43:09.734
to avoid gathering
the master's crumbs."

43:09.936 --> 43:12.104
This reviewer is an idiot.

43:12.105 --> 43:15.941
"Only the painting which portrays
a young girl praying at an altar,

43:16.542 --> 43:19.123
painted with natural
ease, demonstrates

43:19.124 --> 43:21.947
qualities which we hope
will reach maturity

43:21.948 --> 43:24.333
the day when Senor
Picazzo brings richer

43:24.334 --> 43:26.909
experience and study
than he shows today."

43:27.887 --> 43:30.122
You're right for once, Casagemas.

43:30.123 --> 43:32.591
This reviewer is an idiot.

43:32.592 --> 43:34.459
He thinks Picasso's worst
picture is his best.

43:34.460 --> 43:37.362
Hey. You're a bastard,
Nonell. Don't listen to him, Pablo.

43:37.363 --> 43:42.033
No, he's right. It's sentimental.

43:42.468 --> 43:44.803
It's...

43:44.937 --> 43:48.039
old-fashioned.

43:51.444 --> 43:54.446
And it's going to get me to Paris.

43:54.914 --> 43:56.541
I submitted my painting, and it's been

43:56.542 --> 43:58.450
accepted to be show at
the Spanish Pavilion

43:58.451 --> 44:01.319
at the Universal Exposition in Paris.

44:03.389 --> 44:05.624
Oh, we are so proud of you, Pablo.

44:05.625 --> 44:07.259
Aren't we, Papa?

44:07.260 --> 44:09.728
Very proud.

44:13.065 --> 44:14.733
I knew when I saw it.

44:14.734 --> 44:18.837
The girl praying in your picture,
it's Conchita, isn't it?

44:20.273 --> 44:23.008
Yes, Mama.

44:25.144 --> 44:28.079
This is the kind of
work you should be doing, Pablo.

44:28.080 --> 44:30.415
Noble subjects, formal compositions.

44:30.416 --> 44:32.617
Yes. Of course, Papa.

44:32.618 --> 44:34.834
Imagine how you will feel standing

44:34.835 --> 44:37.088
among all those people,
thousands of them,

44:37.089 --> 44:39.257
staring at your painting.

44:39.258 --> 44:42.994
Oh, that would be wonderful, but...

44:44.797 --> 44:47.532
I can't afford to go to Paris.

44:47.867 --> 44:49.034
We'll give you the money.

44:49.035 --> 44:53.204
Won't we?

44:54.874 --> 44:56.942
But you can't afford it either.

44:56.943 --> 44:58.610
Ah, we'll manage.

44:58.611 --> 45:00.812
Don't worry.

45:01.280 --> 45:04.316
Thank you, Mama.

45:07.820 --> 45:10.722
Thank you, Papa.

45:12.158 --> 45:15.360
Be careful how you spend it.

45:15.628 --> 45:17.896
We need two fashionable suits.

45:17.897 --> 45:19.731
We're going to Paris.

45:19.732 --> 45:22.367
Can you make them button
all the way to the collar?

45:22.568 --> 45:24.502
We can't afford waistcoats.

46:17.723 --> 46:19.524
Monsieur Vollard?

46:19.525 --> 46:20.859
Yes?

46:20.860 --> 46:22.460
Carles Casagemas.

46:22.461 --> 46:24.229
I'm sure Isidre Nonell
has mentioned me.

46:24.230 --> 46:26.064
No.

46:26.065 --> 46:29.301
I, I'm residing in his
studio with my friend Picasso here.

46:29.302 --> 46:31.536
He has a painting displayed
at the Spanish Pavilion

46:31.537 --> 46:33.571
in the Universal Exposition.

46:33.572 --> 46:34.806
Perhaps you've seen it?

46:34.807 --> 46:36.274
No.

46:36.275 --> 46:38.109
Oh well...

46:38.110 --> 46:41.246
We're told you have an
affinity for Spanish painters.

46:41.247 --> 46:43.475
And we thought we would give you the

46:43.476 --> 46:45.750
first opportunity to show our work.

46:45.751 --> 46:47.164
No.

46:47.165 --> 46:49.466
Eh, monsieur, you have
not even seen our paintings.

46:49.467 --> 46:53.604
And have you even
looked at the work I sell here?

47:01.780 --> 47:04.148
It's a Cezanne.

47:04.449 --> 47:07.918
Can either of you paint
something as extraordinary as that?

47:12.957 --> 47:15.859
Come back when you can. Hm.

47:23.101 --> 47:25.434
Germany has invaded

47:25.435 --> 47:27.271
Poland and has bombed many towns.

47:27.272 --> 47:31.175
General mobilization has been
ordered in Britain and France.

47:32.477 --> 47:34.311
What is all this, Rosi?

47:34.312 --> 47:37.648
I'm shipping what I
can to London for safekeeping.

47:37.649 --> 47:39.450
Putting the rest in the vault.

47:39.451 --> 47:40.784
That's it then?

47:40.785 --> 47:43.554
You're just, uh, closing up the shop?

47:43.555 --> 47:44.988
Surrendering?

47:44.989 --> 47:46.824
The Nazis are coming.

47:46.825 --> 47:48.759
I'm getting my family to safety.

47:48.760 --> 47:51.228
You should do the same.

47:52.897 --> 47:55.532
Barr can get you all visas.

47:55.533 --> 47:58.969
And what about my paintings,
my sculptures, my etchings?

47:59.304 --> 48:01.505
Can he get me visas for those, too?

48:01.506 --> 48:02.873
Pablo...

48:02.874 --> 48:04.708
Perhaps you can
stuff some in your vault,

48:04.709 --> 48:07.311
but-but I've got
thousands all over France,

48:07.312 --> 48:10.214
at Grands-Augustins,
at Tremblay, even La Boetie.

48:11.216 --> 48:14.484
And the Nazis have labeled
every bit of it as "degenerate."

48:14.819 --> 48:17.888
What do you suppose
they do to degenerates?

48:18.323 --> 48:19.697
Do you think I'm gonna run away

48:19.698 --> 48:21.592
and let them confiscate it or burn it?

48:21.593 --> 48:23.026
You think you can stop them?

48:26.765 --> 48:29.032
Guernica made them very angry, Pablo.

48:33.438 --> 48:36.707
I've had my work destroyed before.

48:44.282 --> 48:47.184
I know what it feels like.

48:48.953 --> 48:51.088
I am not going to let it happen again.

48:51.089 --> 48:54.124
You can always
make more paintings, Pic.

48:57.962 --> 49:00.731
What if I can't, Rosen?

49:07.071 --> 49:11.241
You have children, women you love.

49:16.114 --> 49:19.583
Some things are more
important than art.

49:22.120 --> 49:24.154
No...

49:24.155 --> 49:26.223
Not to me.
