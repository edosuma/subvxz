WEBVTT

00:10.620 --> 00:14.489
"This is the room, the room of death."

00:14.491 --> 00:17.559
I can't have that in my home.
I can't have that going on.

00:17.561 --> 00:18.760
It scared me to death.

00:18.762 --> 00:20.963
It's coming after this kid.

00:20.965 --> 00:23.465
I love my family. I will fight for it.

00:23.467 --> 00:26.068
This is dark and bloody ground here.

00:26.070 --> 00:27.703
It could hurt her.

00:27.705 --> 00:30.105
I'm worried for the safety of his kid.

00:30.107 --> 00:33.141
He says, "They broke my bones."

00:33.143 --> 00:37.446
This is a mess. This is so messed up.

00:37.448 --> 00:40.280
"You're mine. You can't escape."

00:40.380 --> 00:42.643
My name is Amy Allan.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.776
What's happening?

00:44.778 --> 00:45.877
I see dead people.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.313
It seems like a devil.

00:48.315 --> 00:50.949
I speak to dead people.

00:50.951 --> 00:51.950
He's pissed off.

00:51.952 --> 00:53.118
And they speak to me.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.253
I felt real fear.

00:55.255 --> 00:58.223
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:58.225 --> 01:00.225
I think she's being murdered.

01:00.227 --> 01:01.827
I rely on my partner.

01:01.829 --> 01:03.095
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:03.097 --> 01:05.096
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:05.099 --> 01:07.199
Serial killer pops in my head.

01:07.201 --> 01:10.402
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:10.404 --> 01:11.603
Nobody believes me.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.071
It's my job to reveal them.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.340
- Do you think there's still bodies there?
- I do.

01:15.342 --> 01:17.075
But Steve and I never speak...

01:17.077 --> 01:19.111
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:19.113 --> 01:20.312
Until the very end.

01:20.314 --> 01:22.114
You got problems. I got news for you.

01:22.116 --> 01:24.282
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:24.284 --> 01:26.351
This is our house...
whether they like it or not.

01:26.353 --> 01:28.020
Or time to get out.

01:28.022 --> 01:30.689
This is their house, the house of the dead.

01:47.407 --> 01:49.541
I'm in Fort Barnwell, North Carolina.

01:49.543 --> 01:53.512
It's a very small town about
two hours outside of Raleigh.

01:53.514 --> 01:56.815
Amy and I were called in
by a woman named Laura.

01:56.817 --> 01:59.201
She says things are so bad in the house,

01:59.203 --> 02:02.621
she's ready to pack her bags,
grab her 2-year-old, and leave.

02:02.623 --> 02:06.258
The problem is, her husband
wants to stay and fight.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.360
She told me she's running out of options

02:08.362 --> 02:09.594
and we're her last hope.

02:12.698 --> 02:15.050
Before Amy arrives,

02:15.052 --> 02:17.903
I look for any leading information.

02:17.905 --> 02:21.673
This house has a lot of
artwork and family photos

02:21.675 --> 02:24.509
that need to be covered or removed.

02:24.511 --> 02:26.578
When I'm done,

02:26.580 --> 02:28.997
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

02:43.246 --> 02:45.097
Oh, boy.

02:49.936 --> 02:55.941
There's a big problem in one of rooms here.

02:55.943 --> 02:59.177
There's a lot of dead people there.

02:59.179 --> 03:02.581
And they can't see each other,
but they can see the living.

03:02.583 --> 03:06.151
So, whenever they see living people,

03:06.153 --> 03:07.786
they all jump on them.

03:07.788 --> 03:11.239
They want out of there.

03:11.241 --> 03:14.593
It's like a way station
for the dead or something.

03:14.595 --> 03:18.630
Whatever it is, it's a problem.

03:26.072 --> 03:28.173
Well, Laura, you sounded like

03:28.175 --> 03:30.909
you were ready to pack up
and leave when we spoke.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.077
So, what's going on?

03:32.079 --> 03:34.412
Pretty much as soon as we moved in,

03:34.414 --> 03:37.015
we noticed small things started happening.

03:37.017 --> 03:40.585
And it's gotten to the point
where it started to get

03:40.587 --> 03:42.120
a little bit more aggressive.

03:42.122 --> 03:45.090
And as a parent to a 2-year-old,

03:45.092 --> 03:46.391
I can't have that in my home.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.592
I can't have that going on.

03:47.594 --> 03:49.394
Why don't you just move?

03:49.396 --> 03:51.296
I don't want to be here.

03:51.298 --> 03:53.064
But my husband's
grandfather built this home,

03:53.066 --> 03:55.333
so he will not leave.

03:55.335 --> 03:57.068
- He's refusing.
- Refusing.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.703
I want to protect my daughter,

03:58.705 --> 04:02.440
but I love my husband as well,
and I don't... You know?

04:02.442 --> 04:04.576
- I can't just leave.
- Okay.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.828
So, what are some of the
things that are happening?

04:06.830 --> 04:09.147
Electronics do crazy things.

04:09.149 --> 04:12.651
Things have moved on
their own across the room.

04:12.653 --> 04:14.586
People physically touched.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.755
People feel like they're
being watched sometimes,

04:17.757 --> 04:20.524
and there's things my 2-year-old has said

04:20.527 --> 04:22.327
that has been very shocking.

04:22.329 --> 04:26.498
She's been in her room and
been talking to someone,

04:26.500 --> 04:28.600
and my husband's gone in there and just,

04:28.602 --> 04:30.468
"Who are you talking to?" "The man."

04:30.470 --> 04:31.636
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:31.638 --> 04:34.372
How'd you feel when she said that?

04:34.374 --> 04:35.674
I was petrified.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.642
For her to just come up
with that out of nowhere

04:37.644 --> 04:40.946
was very strange to us.

04:40.948 --> 04:44.015
It seems to be drawn to her.

04:54.827 --> 04:56.895
What the hell?

04:58.598 --> 05:01.032
They're thinking that they're seeing,

05:01.034 --> 05:04.102
like, a shadow person.

05:04.104 --> 05:05.904
Who's "they"?

05:05.906 --> 05:08.707
The living people here.

05:08.709 --> 05:11.910
And there's a kid, definitely a kid.

05:15.214 --> 05:19.684
And it's very aware of the kid.

05:19.686 --> 05:20.952
And it's, like,

05:20.954 --> 05:23.455
the way it's moving is very... like this...

05:26.826 --> 05:29.828
To, like, grab the kid.

05:29.830 --> 05:34.933
And, uh, there's, like,
stuff coming off of it.

05:34.935 --> 05:39.404
Like, it has all this stuff
dripping off of its body.

05:39.406 --> 05:41.239
What do you mean?

05:41.241 --> 05:45.543
It almost looks like, like, um, tar, or...

05:45.545 --> 05:48.847
you know, some kind of liquid.

05:48.849 --> 05:51.066
What the [bleep]

05:51.068 --> 05:54.519
It's coming after this kid.

06:02.778 --> 06:06.131
This is where I kind of had
my final breaking point,

06:06.133 --> 06:08.667
and why I wanted to call you guys in.

06:08.669 --> 06:09.768
Okay.

06:09.770 --> 06:12.037
I was actually sitting in the living room,

06:12.039 --> 06:13.838
and I heard a very... very odd noise.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.057
And when I walked around the corner,

06:16.059 --> 06:17.309
I came through here,

06:17.311 --> 06:23.481
and this playroom door had opened.

06:23.483 --> 06:26.484
And it was shoving all
of this out of the way

06:26.486 --> 06:29.154
so that this door was completely opened

06:29.156 --> 06:30.488
against this wall.

06:30.490 --> 06:34.326
Okay. So, you hear...

06:34.328 --> 06:35.794
Mm-hmm.

06:35.796 --> 06:38.263
I mean, I can't even really
do it without pushing it.

06:38.265 --> 06:39.731
Yeah.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.783
So, you got dogs?

06:41.785 --> 06:44.035
Yes. They were going bananas.

06:44.037 --> 06:46.004
But were they the ones that
caused the door to open?

06:46.006 --> 06:48.006
No, they were all sitting on my lap.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.441
We were just watching TV.

06:49.443 --> 06:52.577
And you're sure nobody broke
into the house and then split?

06:52.579 --> 06:54.679
I got a gun out and did a whole
walk-through of the house.

06:54.681 --> 06:57.115
Now, do you get anything else in this room?

06:57.117 --> 06:59.000
Sometimes people have felt watched

06:59.002 --> 07:00.385
in this area of the house.

07:00.387 --> 07:02.220
What areas are we talking about?

07:02.222 --> 07:04.456
Well, that bathroom.

07:04.458 --> 07:07.642
I won't go in.

07:07.644 --> 07:09.327
Geez.

07:09.329 --> 07:10.512
I just don't like it at all.

07:10.514 --> 07:12.530
- So, it's uncomfortable.
- It's very uncomfortable.

07:12.532 --> 07:14.799
Creepy, yeah.

07:14.801 --> 07:16.668
All right.

07:19.071 --> 07:22.240
There's also a male here.

07:22.242 --> 07:26.010
He likes the bathroom.

07:28.047 --> 07:30.448
It makes him very happy.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.184
It doesn't make any of
the living people happy,

07:33.186 --> 07:34.619
but he likes it in here.

07:34.621 --> 07:35.820
Why?

07:35.822 --> 07:42.177
I think most of them feel, like, a presence.

07:42.179 --> 07:44.829
Everything they do, they're being watched,

07:44.831 --> 07:46.798
and it makes them feel uncomfortable,

07:46.800 --> 07:49.367
like somebody's...
somebody's standing behind them.

07:51.103 --> 07:53.605
For some reason, the dead men I'm seeing

07:53.607 --> 07:56.341
are projecting themselves
as shadow people...

07:58.411 --> 07:59.511
but they're not.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.479
They're just conscious entities.

08:01.481 --> 08:07.419
There's a female who
definitely sees this guy.

08:07.421 --> 08:10.722
She has dark hair. It's fairly long.

08:10.724 --> 08:13.942
Like, say she's washing her hands,

08:13.944 --> 08:17.278
he'll, like, suddenly be behind her.

08:17.280 --> 08:19.564
It just is constant,

08:19.566 --> 08:23.468
and she hates it.

08:29.341 --> 08:31.476
So, what's going on in here?

08:31.478 --> 08:34.479
There's one time where I was here by myself,

08:34.481 --> 08:35.813
sleeping right here.

08:35.816 --> 08:38.783
And I just kind of felt and heard, you know,

08:38.784 --> 08:41.986
someone kind of smoothing out the comforter

08:41.988 --> 08:44.155
and, you know, tugging on the edge.

08:44.157 --> 08:47.292
Really?
Did you see the blanket being tugged?

08:47.294 --> 08:49.661
No, but I definitely have heard it,
and I felt it.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.696
I probably would've been swinging at the air

08:51.698 --> 08:53.565
if I would've heard something like that.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.700
No, I think, um, at this point,

08:55.702 --> 08:59.170
there was so many little
things that had been going on,

08:59.172 --> 09:00.705
where we had just started

09:00.707 --> 09:02.974
to almost, in a sense, ignore it.

09:02.976 --> 09:05.443
- So, you got numb to everything
that's been happening. - Mm-hmm.

09:05.445 --> 09:06.795
After we had our daughter,

09:06.797 --> 09:09.547
we kind of couldn't turn a
blind eye to things anymore.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.016
Well, picking on an adult is one thing.

09:12.018 --> 09:13.067
Mm-hmm.

09:13.069 --> 09:14.969
Picking on a baby is another story.

09:14.971 --> 09:16.171
And even with all this,

09:16.173 --> 09:18.306
moving's not an option for your husband?

09:18.308 --> 09:20.475
He just feels, you know,

09:20.477 --> 09:23.795
"This is my home, and I'm staying."

09:30.002 --> 09:32.070
Ah

09:32.072 --> 09:33.538
What?

09:33.540 --> 09:37.141
This room is the way station for the dead,

09:37.143 --> 09:38.610
and all of the activity

09:38.612 --> 09:41.079
is tormenting a woman who lives here.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.714
If the dead are around,

09:42.716 --> 09:48.453
this woman gets horrible pain in her head.

09:48.455 --> 09:52.223
It's because of her ability.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.292
I think she can hear people

09:54.294 --> 09:57.996
talking to her,

09:57.998 --> 10:00.098
whispering to her.

10:00.100 --> 10:03.935
They're coming out of the bed.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.371
Touching, touching, touching.

10:08.908 --> 10:11.976
It's, like, messing with her mind.

10:11.978 --> 10:12.844
You know, "Hey!"

10:12.846 --> 10:15.196
You know, "Hey, I'm here."

10:15.198 --> 10:19.484
If she's around this room
all the [bleep] time,

10:19.486 --> 10:24.188
it could hurt her in the long run, you know?

10:24.190 --> 10:25.323
How?

10:25.325 --> 10:30.662
Feeling, like, defeated. Defeated.

10:30.664 --> 10:34.799
There's no hope. There's no hope.

10:56.933 --> 10:59.051
So, Chris,
I was talking to your wife,

10:59.053 --> 11:00.888
and she says there's no way you're leaving.

11:00.988 --> 11:02.104
Correct.

11:02.106 --> 11:04.840
I love my family, but this is our place.

11:04.842 --> 11:06.358
I will fight for it.

11:06.360 --> 11:08.911
She told me that you may not be so serious

11:08.913 --> 11:10.095
about what's going on here.

11:10.097 --> 11:11.714
I mean, is she accurate about that?

11:11.716 --> 11:13.515
In a way, yes, and in a way, no.

11:13.517 --> 11:15.117
I do write things off.

11:15.119 --> 11:16.418
Okay, what are we talking about?

11:16.420 --> 11:18.921
Me and my wife were in our bedroom,

11:18.923 --> 11:21.757
asleep, and it was after
4:00 in the morning.

11:21.759 --> 11:22.825
TV just came on.

11:22.827 --> 11:25.394
I mean, it had to scare the hell out of you.

11:25.396 --> 11:26.395
Absolutely.

11:26.397 --> 11:27.663
Okay.

11:27.665 --> 11:29.398
- And there was nobody here?
- No, no one here.

11:29.400 --> 11:31.066
Anything else?

11:31.068 --> 11:33.335
I've been touched, physically.

11:33.337 --> 11:34.877
I stood up out of the recliner one night,

11:34.977 --> 11:37.494
and just plain as day,
felt someone touch my shoulder

11:37.496 --> 11:39.579
and felt like they shook it a little bit.

11:39.581 --> 11:41.715
It wasn't a muscle spasm,

11:41.717 --> 11:43.717
it wasn't drinking or anything like that.

11:43.719 --> 11:44.718
It happened.

11:44.720 --> 11:46.219
- You got a 2-year-old here.
- Yes.

11:46.221 --> 11:47.220
A baby girl.

11:47.222 --> 11:49.022
Yes.

11:49.024 --> 11:51.124
And can you imagine her being
touched like you were touched?

11:51.126 --> 11:52.759
No.

11:52.761 --> 11:53.977
I take it seriously,

11:53.979 --> 11:56.396
because I take my daughter's
welfare seriously.

11:56.398 --> 11:59.199
If it wasn't for her,
we wouldn't be talking.

11:59.201 --> 12:01.668
Okay. Uh, well, that being said,

12:01.670 --> 12:05.205
what do you know about any
history on the property?

12:05.207 --> 12:07.507
My grandfather built this house in '74.

12:07.509 --> 12:10.077
His great-grandfather
purchased this property.

12:10.079 --> 12:11.378
Wow. Okay.

12:11.380 --> 12:13.146
- So, your family's been here a long time.
- A long time.

12:13.148 --> 12:16.883
And there was a very major
Indian war fought here.

12:16.885 --> 12:20.754
These supposedly have been repurposed

12:20.756 --> 12:23.924
from Fort Barnwell from
the Tuscarora Indian War.

12:23.926 --> 12:25.092
Wow.

12:25.094 --> 12:27.627
This is my family's legacy.

12:27.629 --> 12:30.831
I'm gonna fight for my house.
I'm gonna fight for our legacy.

12:35.269 --> 12:38.238
There's this old person.

12:40.808 --> 12:42.476
It's a man.

12:42.478 --> 12:47.814
This person, I believe, is a former owner.

12:47.816 --> 12:51.651
He seems to know his way around here.

12:51.653 --> 12:57.591
He's still very sick from
whatever he died from,

12:57.593 --> 13:00.277
which was a long-term illness.

13:00.279 --> 13:03.697
Like, he possibly has a little dementia.

13:08.336 --> 13:10.937
And...

13:10.939 --> 13:14.741
there's some kind of
race thing going on here.

13:14.743 --> 13:20.080
He's desperate to stop it,

13:20.082 --> 13:26.119
but he's not okay to do that.

13:26.121 --> 13:34.428
He can't stop time enough
to stop the things he did.

13:41.502 --> 13:44.104
So, Amy, I was talking to Laura
about the stuff going on here.

13:44.106 --> 13:46.540
She says you guys have been
friends since high school.

13:46.542 --> 13:49.643
Right. We've been friends
for a really long time.

13:49.645 --> 13:51.545
So, I assume you spent
time here in the house.

13:51.547 --> 13:52.512
Well, I used to.

13:52.514 --> 13:54.281
Last time we were here,

13:54.283 --> 13:55.549
terrifying things happened,

13:55.551 --> 13:57.317
and we haven't been back since then.

13:57.319 --> 13:58.718
Okay. Tell me the first thing.

13:58.720 --> 14:00.454
I woke up in the middle of the night,

14:00.456 --> 14:02.355
and those curtains over there were moving.

14:02.357 --> 14:04.291
It was like someone was standing behind it.

14:04.293 --> 14:06.226
What about the windows? Were they open?

14:06.228 --> 14:07.260
No, they were closed.

14:07.262 --> 14:09.129
Did you have the fan or anything else on?

14:09.131 --> 14:10.947
No, there's nothing that could explain it.

14:10.949 --> 14:12.199
So, what else has happened?

14:12.201 --> 14:15.135
Early that morning,
my husband was going hunting,

14:15.137 --> 14:18.171
and I thought that he was
sitting on the corner of the bed

14:18.173 --> 14:19.372
putting his boots on.

14:19.374 --> 14:22.542
And this edge dipped down,

14:22.544 --> 14:25.412
and I looked over and
there was no one in here.

14:25.414 --> 14:28.248
Now, when you felt this thing on the bed,
I mean,

14:28.250 --> 14:29.883
how much pressure are we talking about?

14:29.885 --> 14:33.320
I mean, it was like a grown
man was sitting on it.

14:33.322 --> 14:36.807
I don't know that I'll
ever feel safe coming back

14:36.809 --> 14:38.625
- with a child.
- Really?

14:38.627 --> 14:41.094
Do you think Chris is taking it too lightly?

14:41.096 --> 14:44.631
I do. I'm worried for the safety of his kid.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.099
So am I. That's why I'm here.

14:46.101 --> 14:47.951
I think he should take it more seriously,

14:47.953 --> 14:49.636
before other things start happening.

14:53.474 --> 14:59.513
Uh, there's been bad incidents in here.

14:59.515 --> 15:05.485
Something lives in the closet.

15:07.054 --> 15:11.157
I don't know what this is.
I don't know why it's here.

15:11.159 --> 15:14.227
I just see something
coming out of the closet,

15:14.229 --> 15:18.932
and, uh...

15:18.934 --> 15:21.668
laying on someone

15:21.670 --> 15:26.439
so the person can't move or anything.

15:28.209 --> 15:31.278
Someone says, "Well, this is the room,

15:31.280 --> 15:33.446
the room of death."

15:49.029 --> 15:51.030
Chris told me he thought his house

15:51.032 --> 15:53.065
was built on the site of some Indian wars.

15:53.067 --> 15:54.467
I'm on my way to meet

15:54.469 --> 15:56.235
with a local author who says it's true,

15:56.237 --> 15:59.105
and those battles were some of the bloodiest

15:59.107 --> 16:00.773
in North Carolina history.

16:06.797 --> 16:08.681
So, Doc, what you said on the phone,

16:08.683 --> 16:09.849
my client was right.

16:09.851 --> 16:12.184
There were Native American
wars on the property.

16:12.186 --> 16:13.452
All around it...

16:13.454 --> 16:16.489
very serious wars back in the early 1700s.

16:16.491 --> 16:18.207
Okay. So, what exactly happened?

16:18.209 --> 16:20.025
What started the whole damn thing?

16:20.027 --> 16:21.360
Settlers came in and took land.

16:21.362 --> 16:22.795
That meant less land for Indians.

16:22.797 --> 16:25.231
They're being abused by the settlers.

16:25.233 --> 16:29.034
Indian women would be raped,
and men murdered.

16:29.036 --> 16:34.206
There's also a vibrant
Indian slave trade by 1711.

16:34.208 --> 16:37.376
They'd just grown fed up
with what was happening.

16:37.378 --> 16:39.845
And for a three-day rampage,

16:39.847 --> 16:42.231
they were attacking all these plantations,

16:42.233 --> 16:44.750
these farms, killing men,
women and children,

16:44.752 --> 16:47.219
also killing black slaves, too.

16:47.221 --> 16:49.722
Okay. And this is all around
the property I'm investigating?

16:49.724 --> 16:50.673
Yes.

16:50.675 --> 16:52.491
So, how many did they wind up killing?

16:52.493 --> 16:56.362
Well, about 140 people are
killed in the three days.

16:56.364 --> 16:58.030
They are taken totally by surprise.

16:58.032 --> 17:00.182
In fact, one settler who survived said,

17:00.184 --> 17:01.567
"It's people that we knew.

17:01.569 --> 17:04.103
We see smiling faces,
and then they attacked us."

17:04.105 --> 17:05.037
How brutal was it?

17:05.039 --> 17:07.839
A lot of them are hatcheted,

17:07.842 --> 17:10.142
knifed, and often, their bodies

17:10.144 --> 17:14.180
were put in, like,
positions of prayer in some cases.

17:14.182 --> 17:16.115
We also have stories of pregnant women

17:16.117 --> 17:17.650
having the babies ripped out.

17:17.652 --> 17:19.417
Some of them are impaled.

17:19.420 --> 17:21.554
I mean, this is pretty brutal right there.

17:23.623 --> 17:26.925
What the [bleep]

17:26.928 --> 17:29.829
There's, like,
people all lined up against the wall.

17:29.831 --> 17:34.166
They're all fresh, like, fresh corpses.

17:34.168 --> 17:36.969
They're all white. Quite a few women.

17:36.971 --> 17:39.839
All I can get is, like, they're running.

17:42.076 --> 17:44.560
I don't see what the [bleep]
they're running from.

17:44.562 --> 17:46.545
I feel like it's unexpected.

17:46.547 --> 17:49.281
I think it was a normal
day to start out with,

17:49.283 --> 17:52.718
and then this sudden panic,
and then running,

17:52.720 --> 17:55.421
running for your life.

17:55.423 --> 17:57.189
And then they're here like this.

17:57.191 --> 18:01.293
These are all people
this happened to that day

18:01.295 --> 18:06.699
and probably didn't have a good burial.

18:09.836 --> 18:11.987
I'm curious about the white settlers.

18:11.989 --> 18:13.939
What happened with their bodies?

18:13.941 --> 18:16.141
They complained about,
"We can't bury our dead

18:16.143 --> 18:17.977
"until the wolves are eating our dead

18:17.979 --> 18:19.879
and the vultures are eating our dead."

18:19.881 --> 18:23.782
People were too afraid to
leave those fortified houses,

18:23.784 --> 18:26.085
and the Indians kind of
go back to their villages

18:26.087 --> 18:27.887
to wait and see what's gonna happen.

18:27.889 --> 18:30.089
They're expecting a response.

18:30.091 --> 18:33.993
So, North Carolina calls
on South Carolina for help.

18:33.995 --> 18:36.862
They send Colonel John Barnwell.

18:36.864 --> 18:38.898
He goes to this place called Core Town,

18:38.900 --> 18:41.634
and he turns it into Fort Barnwell.

18:41.636 --> 18:44.203
My client believes the
bricks from his fireplace

18:44.205 --> 18:45.504
came from Fort Barnwell.

18:45.506 --> 18:46.839
Well, it's possible.

18:46.841 --> 18:48.307
So, what happens next?

18:48.309 --> 18:51.644
John Barnwell,
he's willing to sign a peace treaty.

18:51.646 --> 18:54.647
And so the Indians said,
"Great, we'll sign one."

18:54.649 --> 18:58.017
Over 400 Indians show up,
men, women, and children.

18:58.019 --> 19:00.536
They're expecting to sign a treaty.

19:00.538 --> 19:02.855
And then, at a surprise moment,

19:02.857 --> 19:04.990
Barnwell and these militia attack.

19:04.992 --> 19:09.094
About 50 Indians are just killed right off,

19:09.096 --> 19:11.397
and most women and
children are then enslaved.

19:11.399 --> 19:13.532
This is dark and bloody ground here.

19:16.236 --> 19:17.469
I don't know why

19:17.471 --> 19:20.205
they're all stuck in
the wall here like this.

19:20.207 --> 19:21.440
How many?

19:25.245 --> 19:27.379
About 18.

19:27.381 --> 19:31.550
They can't move. They can't speak.

19:31.552 --> 19:35.254
It feels like something bad happened,
whatever.

19:35.256 --> 19:36.355
They all die right...

19:36.357 --> 19:38.524
They're all together like this,

19:38.526 --> 19:41.260
and why they're kind of, like, bound...

19:41.262 --> 19:44.296
Like, this would be a binding on the dead...

19:44.298 --> 19:45.831
is very [bleep] weird.

19:45.833 --> 19:49.368
Someone put some sort of
spell on these dead people.

19:49.370 --> 19:52.271
They can think and see,
but they are all stuck together,

19:52.273 --> 19:53.839
unable to move or communicate.

19:53.841 --> 20:00.613
I want to say that they were
put together even after death.

20:00.615 --> 20:05.351
This is, uh...

20:08.822 --> 20:10.322
terrible.

20:25.840 --> 20:27.474
With hundreds killed

20:27.476 --> 20:29.777
during Native American wars in the 1700s,

20:29.779 --> 20:31.111
my client's land has seen

20:31.113 --> 20:33.681
more than its fair share
of death and violence.

20:33.683 --> 20:36.383
But something tells me the
tragedy didn't end there.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.786
Digging through the archives,

20:38.788 --> 20:42.823
I find a local farmhand
burned to death in the 1940s.

20:42.825 --> 20:44.391
Turns out he worked

20:44.393 --> 20:47.595
for my client's great-great-grandfather.

20:47.597 --> 20:49.663
Fires are always suspicious,

20:49.665 --> 20:51.799
and I want to know more
about the worker that died

20:51.801 --> 20:53.133
on Chris and Laura's property.

20:53.135 --> 20:55.553
I'm heading over to meet
with a history professor

20:55.555 --> 20:57.004
who's looking into it for me.

21:04.546 --> 21:06.380
I found out during my research

21:06.382 --> 21:08.515
that my client's great-great-grandfather

21:08.517 --> 21:11.752
had a farmhand who burned to
death right on the property.

21:11.754 --> 21:13.787
What do you know about
this guy and what happened?

21:13.789 --> 21:16.290
William Loften was a farmhand

21:16.292 --> 21:20.828
who lived on Hugh Lane's Farm in the 1940s.

21:20.830 --> 21:23.797
He was a World War II veteran.

21:23.799 --> 21:24.765
Okay.

21:24.767 --> 21:27.134
And when he returned from the war,

21:27.136 --> 21:29.803
he went back to work on the farm.

21:29.805 --> 21:31.438
So, what happened?

21:31.440 --> 21:33.374
March 14, 1949...

21:33.376 --> 21:37.011
Sometime in the night, he was asleep.

21:37.013 --> 21:38.512
The house caught on fire.

21:38.514 --> 21:41.332
His wife came home to
see the house collapsing.

21:41.334 --> 21:42.416
Geez.

21:42.418 --> 21:43.684
I have a death certificate,

21:43.686 --> 21:47.788
and it says that he died from extreme burns.

21:47.790 --> 21:50.858
Okay. Do they know what might
have caused the fire then?

21:50.860 --> 21:52.426
What the newspaper, the <i> Sun Journal,</i> says

21:52.428 --> 21:56.313
is that the fire was started
by a stove that overheated.

21:56.315 --> 21:59.033
Now, Kate, according to the
article I came across,

21:59.035 --> 22:00.517
it said five black farmhands

22:00.519 --> 22:02.736
were killed within a week from burning.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.772
It sounds suspicious to me,

22:04.774 --> 22:05.397
'cause when you read the article,

22:05.497 --> 22:08.064
right away I'm thinking there's
racial undertones to it.

22:08.066 --> 22:11.610
Was the Klan active back in
'49 in the Fort Barnwell area?

22:11.710 --> 22:14.811
Well, there were pockets of Klan activity,

22:14.813 --> 22:17.080
but there wasn't anything

22:17.082 --> 22:19.316
that indicates that it was suspicious.

22:19.318 --> 22:22.686
So, Kate, looking at this case,
as far as the victim goes,

22:22.688 --> 22:26.290
it's a fire that can be
easily made to look accidental

22:26.292 --> 22:28.392
and be a crime, or just accidental.

22:28.394 --> 22:30.661
I mean, I don't think we'll ever know.

22:30.663 --> 22:32.162
It's something to think about.

22:34.132 --> 22:38.902
Those corpses are
still kind of in the wall.

22:38.904 --> 22:42.973
Yeah, they're bound. They're bound.

22:44.692 --> 22:47.945
I don't think that any of these people

22:47.947 --> 22:50.013
deserve to be like this.

22:50.015 --> 22:52.416
But that shadow,

22:52.418 --> 22:57.354
it thinks that they do
deserve to be like this.

22:57.356 --> 23:00.324
But this is the same person
that the kid was seeing?

23:00.326 --> 23:04.561
Yes. He's saying, "Oh, you know,
'cause they're white people,

23:04.563 --> 23:06.797
then that's why you're siding with them."

23:06.799 --> 23:09.933
He's crawling.

23:09.935 --> 23:13.837
So, he can't stand up
because it hurts too much.

23:15.673 --> 23:17.908
He says, "They broke my bones."

23:17.910 --> 23:19.843
Do you know when he's from?

23:19.845 --> 23:22.246
It feels more recent to me.

23:22.248 --> 23:24.848
It doesn't look like he died very well.

23:24.850 --> 23:28.785
It was at night, but also warm.

23:28.787 --> 23:31.922
This is uncomfortable.

23:31.924 --> 23:35.926
This is a mess. This is so messed up.

23:38.279 --> 23:40.697
So, we've got brutal Indian wars

23:40.699 --> 23:43.934
and a worker who burned to
death on my client's property.

23:43.936 --> 23:45.736
But one other thing caught my attention

23:45.738 --> 23:47.137
while I was doing my research...

23:47.139 --> 23:51.041
a murder-suicide that involved one of Chris'
ancestors.

23:51.043 --> 23:53.810
I'm heading over to meet a historian

23:53.812 --> 23:56.813
who says it's a case of obsessive love.

24:02.754 --> 24:05.622
I came across this article
during my research,

24:05.624 --> 24:09.593
and it looks like a
distant cousin of my client

24:09.595 --> 24:11.061
was involved in a murder-suicide.

24:11.063 --> 24:12.279
This guy Lonnie Lane.

24:12.281 --> 24:14.631
Now, do you know anything about this guy?

24:14.633 --> 24:17.601
He was a young man. He was born in 1879.

24:17.603 --> 24:19.870
When he was 20 years old,

24:19.872 --> 24:22.673
he apparently began a
relationship of some sort

24:22.675 --> 24:25.542
with a young girl named Glennie Sauls.

24:25.544 --> 24:28.011
This was in the spring of 1899.

24:28.013 --> 24:30.647
But she was only 14 years old.

24:30.649 --> 24:32.115
Her parents objected to the relationship

24:32.117 --> 24:33.216
because of the age difference,

24:33.218 --> 24:36.019
so they basically forbid him to see her.

24:36.021 --> 24:38.989
In March... March 24, 1899,

24:38.991 --> 24:40.407
he apparently went to her house

24:40.409 --> 24:41.992
while her parents were out of town.

24:41.994 --> 24:43.794
And they were seen leaving the house

24:43.796 --> 24:45.629
and going on a walk toward the woods.

24:45.631 --> 24:47.597
Okay. So, what happens next?

24:47.599 --> 24:50.200
They're not seen for the
rest of the afternoon.

24:50.202 --> 24:52.135
And when nightfall comes,
people become concerned

24:52.137 --> 24:53.570
and they begin to search for them,

24:53.572 --> 24:54.938
and their bodies are found in the woods,

24:54.940 --> 24:56.306
both shot in the head.

24:56.308 --> 25:00.110
So, here's one of the articles that appeared,
and it gives

25:00.112 --> 25:02.346
the details of their relationship

25:02.348 --> 25:04.648
and what may have happened that afternoon.

25:04.650 --> 25:06.083
There's been some speculation

25:06.085 --> 25:07.951
that he wanted to propose marriage to her

25:07.953 --> 25:10.287
and that she may have rejected him

25:10.289 --> 25:12.122
and then he just couldn't
deal with that rejection.

25:12.124 --> 25:14.257
And the speculation was that

25:14.259 --> 25:16.727
he had shot her and then
turned the gun on himself.

25:21.265 --> 25:24.801
This guy who's always in the bathroom,

25:24.803 --> 25:31.575
I think somehow he's
related to the living here.

25:31.577 --> 25:37.748
He had said that he died outside.

25:37.750 --> 25:41.585
He has something that's,
like, hanging off of him.

25:41.587 --> 25:44.187
Like, if it's moss.

25:44.189 --> 25:47.391
I don't think it was a good death.

25:56.467 --> 25:59.569
During my walk, I saw a group of dead people

25:59.571 --> 26:02.472
trying to get the attention of the living

26:02.474 --> 26:04.040
in the master bedroom.

26:04.042 --> 26:08.178
I'm meeting with an artist to
describe this horrifying scene.

26:08.180 --> 26:11.515
There's two people sleeping in the bed.

26:11.517 --> 26:16.052
There's a bunch of dead people,
like, holding their legs...

26:16.054 --> 26:18.488
Four on one side and
like three on the other.

26:23.361 --> 26:25.462
Is this what you saw?

26:26.664 --> 26:28.445
Yes. That's what I saw.

26:49.983 --> 26:53.652
Now that Amy and I have
finished our investigations,

26:53.654 --> 26:56.928
it's time to reveal our findings
to our clients and each other

26:57.028 --> 26:58.360
for the first time.

26:58.362 --> 27:01.071
Well, Amy, I'd like you
to meet Chris and Laura.

27:01.171 --> 27:04.606
The activity here is pretty bad,
up to the point where

27:04.608 --> 27:06.408
Laura's ready to pack up her bags and leave.

27:06.410 --> 27:10.712
Now, this property has been in Chris' family

27:10.714 --> 27:13.014
- for generations.
- Okay.

27:13.016 --> 27:16.034
So, he does not want to leave,
no matter what.

27:16.036 --> 27:17.318
But one thing they both agree on,

27:17.320 --> 27:19.187
they're worried about
their 2-year-old daughter,

27:19.189 --> 27:20.889
and that's why we're here.

27:20.891 --> 27:23.425
Now that Amy knows a little
bit about what's going on here,

27:23.427 --> 27:27.095
I'm gonna have her tell us about her walk.

27:30.433 --> 27:33.701
There were a couple of individuals

27:33.703 --> 27:38.339
who initially showed
themselves like shadow figures,

27:38.341 --> 27:40.158
but they're not.

27:40.160 --> 27:44.195
One of them loves the
bathroom because it's quiet.

27:44.197 --> 27:46.147
It's like his sanctuary.

27:46.149 --> 27:47.816
And there was a living woman

27:47.818 --> 27:52.253
that I saw that he keyed in on,
and she had dark hair.

27:52.255 --> 27:54.055
And he's standing right behind her.

27:54.057 --> 27:56.708
And one of the things in the bathroom

27:56.710 --> 27:59.527
was this sense of always being watched.

27:59.529 --> 28:02.997
When we first moved in, I hated the bathroom

28:02.999 --> 28:04.165
I hated it.

28:04.167 --> 28:07.202
Like, the first two years we lived here,

28:07.204 --> 28:08.937
I wouldn't go in there.

28:08.939 --> 28:10.288
Interesting.

28:10.290 --> 28:13.875
And, uh, my daughter,
she'll stay in that bathroom.

28:13.877 --> 28:16.344
She's mentioned talking to a man before.

28:16.346 --> 28:18.363
She has mentioned
talking to a man before.

28:18.365 --> 28:19.214
Wow.

28:19.216 --> 28:20.348
Okay.

28:20.350 --> 28:22.717
Now, do you know
anything about this guy,

28:22.719 --> 28:24.536
who he was in life?

28:24.538 --> 28:28.122
Well, he was about 6 feet tall, thin.

28:28.124 --> 28:29.924
He indicated that he died outside.

28:29.926 --> 28:33.595
He had something kind of hanging off him,

28:33.597 --> 28:35.296
like a moss or a mold or something.

28:35.298 --> 28:38.933
I got that this was not a good death.

28:38.935 --> 28:41.603
I kind of think that he was murdered.

28:41.605 --> 28:44.105
It does bring to mind one story

28:44.107 --> 28:45.740
that took place right near here,

28:45.742 --> 28:49.043
and it involves a distant relative of yours.

28:49.045 --> 28:53.348
His name was Lonnie Lane.
He was 20 years old.

28:53.350 --> 28:55.250
He got involved with a 14-year-old girl,

28:55.252 --> 28:57.952
this girl Glennie Sauls.

28:57.954 --> 29:00.421
Now, her parents were not happy
about them being together.

29:00.423 --> 29:02.490
They didn't like the idea
of the age difference,

29:02.492 --> 29:07.896
but one day in March of 1899,
the parents were away.

29:07.898 --> 29:09.247
Lonnie came to Glennie's house.

29:09.249 --> 29:11.499
They both left and walked into the woods,
never came out.

29:11.501 --> 29:14.836
They were both found later,
one shot to the head each.

29:14.838 --> 29:18.273
Here's the article from it.

29:18.275 --> 29:19.741
So, when she said the moss,

29:19.743 --> 29:21.320
the only thing I'm thinking
was they were in the woods.

29:21.420 --> 29:23.386
They did die outside.

29:23.388 --> 29:25.021
I've heard of
Lonnie Lane in our family.

29:25.023 --> 29:26.589
- Really?
- Yes.

29:26.591 --> 29:27.724
I didn't know about this.

29:29.593 --> 29:32.946
That's one of the people
that's presenting themselves

29:32.948 --> 29:36.686
- kind of like a shadow person, but it's not.
- No.

29:36.786 --> 29:38.452
Okay. So, who's the second guy?

29:38.454 --> 29:42.940
I walked in, went into this
area by that door in the hall,

29:42.942 --> 29:45.342
and he was, like, covered

29:45.344 --> 29:50.648
in, like, a black ooze, oil, tar substance.

29:50.650 --> 29:56.320
And he was actually
interacting with a child.

29:56.322 --> 30:02.126
And the kid was freaked out.

30:02.128 --> 30:03.327
And it's, like,

30:03.329 --> 30:06.130
the way it's moving is very... like this...

30:09.234 --> 30:10.701
To, like, grab the kid.

30:10.703 --> 30:14.738
It's coming after this kid.

30:14.740 --> 30:20.911
I did get that he was black,
and he hates white people.

30:20.913 --> 30:26.250
I also got that he died outside,
and it was nighttime.

30:26.252 --> 30:29.887
And one word that I was hearing was "warm."

30:29.889 --> 30:31.822
"Warm"

30:31.824 --> 30:34.592
All right, well,

30:34.594 --> 30:36.944
there was an incident where a guy got killed

30:36.946 --> 30:38.696
on this property back in 1949.

30:38.698 --> 30:40.898
He was a black guy. He was 35 years old.

30:40.900 --> 30:44.435
His name was William Loften.

30:44.437 --> 30:46.737
Now, Loften was a tenant farmer

30:46.739 --> 30:49.506
for your great-great-grandfather Hugh.

30:49.508 --> 30:52.042
Now, you had mentioned
that he died at night.

30:52.044 --> 30:53.978
- You heard "warm?"
- Yep.

30:53.980 --> 30:56.714
On March 14, 1949,

30:56.716 --> 30:58.682
his house caught fire,

30:58.684 --> 31:02.553
and he was burned to death inside the house.

31:02.555 --> 31:04.021
This is the guy's death certificate.

31:04.023 --> 31:06.590
Now, the official cause listed is burns.

31:06.592 --> 31:09.493
Police say it was a stove
that caused the fire,

31:09.495 --> 31:13.631
but what I found odd,

31:13.633 --> 31:17.902
there was article that says
"Fifth Negro Burns at Farm."

31:17.904 --> 31:23.361
The historian said there was
Klan activity here at the time.

31:23.461 --> 31:24.647
There was.

31:24.747 --> 31:28.182
But a fire like that's easily
done to make it look accidental.

31:28.184 --> 31:29.250
Mm-hmm.

31:33.155 --> 31:37.792
When I walked in the living room area,

31:37.794 --> 31:40.161
I look at the wall,

31:40.163 --> 31:44.632
and there was about 15 to
18 corpses standing upright.

31:44.634 --> 31:48.319
All of these people were together,

31:48.321 --> 31:52.640
and for some reason, somebody bound them.

31:52.642 --> 31:54.375
What does that mean?

31:54.377 --> 31:57.712
Someone at some point put a spell on them.

31:57.714 --> 32:01.883
So, they can see everything that's going on,

32:01.885 --> 32:05.319
but they can't speak and they can't move.

32:05.321 --> 32:10.141
Who would've been in the
house that would've bound...

32:10.143 --> 32:12.260
Well, that's the thing.

32:12.262 --> 32:15.863
The other part of what I got was that

32:15.865 --> 32:18.749
most of these people were female.

32:18.751 --> 32:20.468
They were all white.

32:20.470 --> 32:23.671
All of them seemed to have
died at the same time.

32:23.673 --> 32:26.841
I saw it was, like, a nice day.

32:26.843 --> 32:28.910
All of a sudden, everybody's running.

32:28.912 --> 32:31.379
I know that they were
running for their lives.

32:33.749 --> 32:37.118
Something was done with their bodies.

32:37.120 --> 32:42.390
Like, I don't know if it was a mass grave,
desecration.

32:42.392 --> 32:43.524
That sounds spot-on

32:43.526 --> 32:45.126
for something that happened
here 300 years ago.

32:46.662 --> 32:51.332
In 1711, the Tuscarora Indians went,
basically, nuts

32:51.334 --> 32:53.234
and started attacking everybody and killing
'em,

32:53.236 --> 32:55.336
'cause the white settlers that were here

32:55.338 --> 32:56.804
were stealing from them.

32:56.806 --> 32:58.973
They were raping their women.

32:58.975 --> 33:04.045
So, they decided to attack
them in a three-day rampage.

33:04.047 --> 33:08.182
They killed 140 men, women, and children.

33:08.184 --> 33:09.784
They mutilated the bodies.

33:09.786 --> 33:12.119
They ripped babies from
pregnant women's stomachs.

33:12.121 --> 33:13.454
Oh, my goodness.

33:13.456 --> 33:15.189
So, now, they were so scared

33:15.191 --> 33:18.292
they couldn't even go and
get their bodies to bury 'em.

33:18.294 --> 33:20.861
So, after this attack happened,

33:20.863 --> 33:23.631
North Carolina decided to
reach out to South Carolina

33:23.633 --> 33:25.299
for help.

33:25.301 --> 33:27.318
They sent a guy named Colonel John Barnwell.

33:27.320 --> 33:30.638
So, what Barnwell wound up
doing is setting up a fort,

33:30.640 --> 33:32.940
Fort Barnwell, right near here.

33:32.942 --> 33:35.626
So, what he did was try
to sign a peace treaty

33:35.628 --> 33:37.912
and said, "All right, come to the fort

33:37.914 --> 33:41.082
and we'll sign this treaty,
and everything will be nice."

33:41.084 --> 33:42.683
So, 400 Native Americans came,

33:42.685 --> 33:44.885
thinking it was gonna be a celebration.

33:44.887 --> 33:47.455
So, they came with kids, women.

33:47.457 --> 33:48.656
Barnwell attacked.

33:48.658 --> 33:50.341
They weren't expecting it.

33:50.343 --> 33:52.159
50 of them died right away,

33:52.161 --> 33:54.428
and the rest,
they basically took into slavery

33:54.430 --> 33:56.314
and sent them down to South Carolina

33:56.316 --> 33:58.833
to be put in the slave trade.

33:58.835 --> 34:02.269
Matter of fact, see this fireplace here?

34:02.271 --> 34:04.789
That was built from bricks

34:04.791 --> 34:07.708
that was from the fort that Barnwell built.

34:07.710 --> 34:09.909
Oh, gosh.

34:09.911 --> 34:11.911
My grandfather built this house.

34:11.914 --> 34:13.748
- Your grandfather built this house?
- In '74.

34:13.750 --> 34:15.216
Wow. Okay.

34:15.217 --> 34:19.553
Well, I wasn't sure if he lived here or not,

34:19.554 --> 34:25.359
but I saw this elderly
man in the living room.

34:25.360 --> 34:28.795
He was very attached to this location,

34:28.797 --> 34:32.433
and I got that he died
from a long-term illness.

34:34.101 --> 34:37.405
The other thing was there were things

34:37.407 --> 34:41.324
that happened that he felt responsible for,

34:41.327 --> 34:44.812
that had possibly led to some deaths,

34:44.813 --> 34:47.748
and it involved racial issues.

34:47.750 --> 34:52.402
And he was like, "It's all my fault."

34:52.405 --> 34:55.438
So, I don't know if the illness affected him

34:55.440 --> 34:57.725
or if he also had, like,
a little bit of dementia

34:57.727 --> 34:58.959
or something like that,

34:58.961 --> 35:02.313
because he's very lost, very confused.

35:02.315 --> 35:05.232
You're talking of my grandfather.

35:06.735 --> 35:09.937
He had Parkinson's,
and he had a lot of dementia.

35:09.939 --> 35:12.239
Okay.

35:14.444 --> 35:16.477
This was his dream home.

35:16.479 --> 35:17.445
Take that.

35:17.447 --> 35:19.647
This was his pride and joy.

35:19.649 --> 35:21.165
Sorry.

35:21.167 --> 35:25.519
But why would he blame himself
for the racial tension, though?

35:27.606 --> 35:30.758
Yeah, I'd really rather not talk about it.

35:35.298 --> 35:38.432
Some of these people
that would be brought into this

35:38.434 --> 35:40.284
are still living,
and I don't want to hurt feelings.

35:40.286 --> 35:42.703
No, no, no. It's totally understandable.

35:42.705 --> 35:45.272
But you are talking about my grandfather.

35:45.274 --> 35:48.576
This is crazy.

35:54.349 --> 35:55.800
Anything else?

35:55.802 --> 35:58.953
I went into the master bedroom,

35:58.955 --> 36:01.021
and I saw a living woman there...

36:01.023 --> 36:03.457
thin, dark hair.

36:03.459 --> 36:06.994
And she looked defeated.

36:06.996 --> 36:09.563
She was sitting on the side of the bed,

36:09.565 --> 36:11.432
like [bleep]

36:11.434 --> 36:15.803
I got that she's having a lot of pain,

36:15.805 --> 36:17.605
really bad headaches.

36:17.607 --> 36:20.541
In that area, a whole bunch
of dead people came out.

36:20.543 --> 36:25.079
They can't really see anything,
but they can see living people.

36:25.081 --> 36:28.048
And I saw two people in the bed

36:28.050 --> 36:32.786
and the dead people surrounding
them and touching them.

36:32.788 --> 36:37.224
They were trying to, you know,
get people's attention.

36:37.226 --> 36:40.127
You were telling me about it
happening in the master bedroom.

36:40.129 --> 36:41.962
Mm-hmm. I remember laying in bed,

36:41.964 --> 36:44.298
and it was just, like, fluttering

36:44.300 --> 36:45.933
over the end of the bed,

36:45.935 --> 36:49.503
like, maybe smoothing it out,
pulling the corners down.

36:49.505 --> 36:50.938
Okay.

36:50.940 --> 36:52.239
But you've been grabbed.

36:52.241 --> 36:54.208
Definitely.

36:54.210 --> 36:57.178
It was just, like, you know?
Like, "Hey, I'm here."

36:57.180 --> 36:58.746
Wow.

36:58.748 --> 37:04.185
Well, I did do a sketch of what I saw.

37:12.027 --> 37:14.261
That looks like you in the bed.

37:19.807 --> 37:21.225
I don't like it.

37:24.179 --> 37:25.084
You okay?

37:44.164 --> 37:48.000
I did do a sketch of what I saw.

37:56.309 --> 37:58.177
That looks like you in the bed.

38:04.251 --> 38:07.419
I don't like it.

38:12.258 --> 38:13.325
You okay?

38:25.238 --> 38:30.629
I have countless times sat on that bed

38:30.729 --> 38:33.463
and cried on that bed

38:33.465 --> 38:35.515
and just been like. "[bleep]"

38:35.517 --> 38:38.234
Like, "Why did I move out here?

38:38.236 --> 38:41.104
But what do they want? What do they want?

38:41.106 --> 38:43.273
They don't want to be here anymore,

38:43.275 --> 38:44.374
because they're stuck.

38:44.376 --> 38:49.312
And the female in particular has abilities.

38:50.314 --> 38:55.952
And so the dead are very attracted to that.

38:55.954 --> 38:58.588
And they want help,
and they don't want to be here anymore.

38:58.590 --> 39:00.156
I mean, did you have any idea?

39:00.158 --> 39:01.174
I knew it was me.

39:01.176 --> 39:02.258
Deep... I knew...

39:02.260 --> 39:04.561
in the back of my head, it was me.

39:04.563 --> 39:05.729
I knew it.

39:05.731 --> 39:08.865
I didn't want to say it ever, out loud,

39:08.867 --> 39:10.166
but I knew it.

39:10.168 --> 39:13.169
So, now, what's got me
concerned is the baby.

39:13.171 --> 39:15.238
The baby sees stuff and talks to stuff.

39:15.240 --> 39:17.374
I'm 100% positive of that.

39:17.376 --> 39:19.009
I'm 100% positive of that,

39:19.011 --> 39:21.811
and that's the only
reason why y'all are here.

39:21.813 --> 39:25.115
Well, when we spoke,
you said you'd do anything,

39:25.117 --> 39:27.000
short of selling this house,

39:27.002 --> 39:29.219
- to protect your family.
- Correct.

39:29.221 --> 39:31.438
Okay. So, now we're gonna
find out what it's gonna take.

39:31.440 --> 39:32.856
So, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy

39:32.858 --> 39:34.924
and see what she's got for us.

39:38.295 --> 39:43.533
So, there's a few steps,
and it'll take a little while.

39:43.535 --> 39:45.295
What needs to be done first

39:45.395 --> 39:49.497
is a male who's black who's also a medium

39:49.499 --> 39:55.436
needs to come in and make contact

39:55.438 --> 40:00.107
with the male that's in
the living room area.

40:00.109 --> 40:02.710
He needs to talk to him and listen to him

40:02.712 --> 40:06.047
and work with him to move him on.

40:06.049 --> 40:09.917
Then, the second day, he needs to come back

40:09.919 --> 40:13.487
and deal with the master-bedroom situation,

40:13.489 --> 40:14.855
which he needs to seal.

40:14.857 --> 40:16.857
When he's doing the sealing,

40:16.859 --> 40:18.693
the last thing I do want him to do

40:18.695 --> 40:21.295
is to use tar water at the end.

40:21.297 --> 40:22.747
This is something

40:22.749 --> 40:26.167
that completely negates
the space for the dead.

40:26.169 --> 40:28.636
So, there will never be another dead person

40:28.638 --> 40:30.538
that comes in that room, ever.

40:31.540 --> 40:34.008
After that,

40:34.010 --> 40:38.846
a shaman needs to be
contacted from the tribe.

40:38.848 --> 40:39.980
Tuscarora tribe.

40:39.982 --> 40:42.113
- Yeah.
- Okay.

40:42.213 --> 40:45.247
So, they need to come and do a release

40:45.249 --> 40:48.016
for the people that are trapped in the wall

40:48.018 --> 40:51.353
'cause they are the only ones
who can undo what they did.

40:51.355 --> 40:54.189
Once that's done,

40:54.191 --> 40:57.125
the elderly gentleman, your grandfather,

40:57.127 --> 41:01.330
will leave of his own accord
'cause he'll feel good.

41:01.332 --> 41:03.158
So, now, what about her
abilities and the baby?

41:03.258 --> 41:04.925
Her bedroom is going to be

41:04.927 --> 41:10.664
completely sealed forever
from any dead coming in.

41:10.666 --> 41:13.834
What happens if one day your
daughter comes to you and says,

41:13.836 --> 41:16.069
you know, "All this stuff is happening."

41:16.071 --> 41:17.587
Would you want her to close up?

41:17.589 --> 41:19.272
Yeah.

41:19.274 --> 41:21.908
You guys won't know until
she's a little bit older

41:21.910 --> 41:24.811
if she's going to be open

41:24.813 --> 41:28.181
or if she's going to close down or repress.

41:28.183 --> 41:31.251
So, it's kind of a waiting game right now

41:31.253 --> 41:33.753
to see which way she's gonna go.

41:33.755 --> 41:36.556
So, I want to ask you straight out,

41:36.558 --> 41:39.492
are you guys gonna take Amy's advice?

41:39.494 --> 41:40.527
Absolutely.

41:40.529 --> 41:41.361
Okay.

41:41.363 --> 41:42.379
100%.

41:42.381 --> 41:44.130
Okay, good. I'm glad to hear that.

41:44.132 --> 41:45.799
Yeah, I want this house to be ours...

41:45.801 --> 41:48.869
me, her, my daughter's.

41:48.871 --> 41:51.938
I'm concerned for Laura and Chris,

41:51.940 --> 41:56.076
as the dead within their home
pose a very serious danger.

41:56.078 --> 41:58.111
But I believe if they follow my advice,

41:58.113 --> 42:00.981
they'll remain safe and
live a peaceful life,

42:00.983 --> 42:04.451
keeping their home in the
family for generations to come.
