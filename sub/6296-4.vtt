00:24.422 --> 00:26.548
The cardinal's come
to discuss the deposition

00:26.573 --> 00:28.084
of the Borgia pope, father.

00:28.321 --> 00:30.989
He's appointed a veritable
cascade of cardinals.

00:31.057 --> 00:33.558
Among them, his son.

00:33.626 --> 00:36.828
It seems the good Cardinal
Della Rovere has fled.

00:36.896 --> 00:39.531
You have someone
who can wield a good garrotte.

00:39.599 --> 00:42.400
Maybe it's time
for the cardinal's collar

00:42.501 --> 00:44.436
to be replaced.
- Guards! An assassin!

00:44.503 --> 00:46.571
[Yelling]

00:46.672 --> 00:48.106
So you failed.

00:48.174 --> 00:49.841
It was the wounds
on my back that betrayed me.

00:49.909 --> 00:52.210
Then have him followed--
by someone other than you.

00:52.311 --> 00:56.481
The Sultan of Constantinople
would pay us to welcome

00:56.582 --> 00:58.550
his half-brother Djem
into our care.

00:58.618 --> 01:01.219
- Forty thousand ducats.
- If he lives.

01:01.287 --> 01:04.388
If he dies, 400,000.

01:04.456 --> 01:06.336
Giulia Farnese is having
her portrait painted?

01:06.361 --> 01:07.561
Papa commissioned it.

01:08.127 --> 01:11.730
I banished my husband
for your sake!

01:11.797 --> 01:14.532
Have you heard the news, Djem?
I'm to be married.

01:14.634 --> 01:16.201
Oh, my dear.

01:16.269 --> 01:19.804
If our families were to unite,
the Sforza family would need

01:19.872 --> 01:21.057
an agreement on a dowry.

01:21.157 --> 01:22.657
But of course.

01:22.775 --> 01:24.365
Do I have to marry, Cesare?

01:24.390 --> 01:26.519
What if my husband proves
ungallant?

01:26.579 --> 01:28.914
That heathen outstays
his welcome.

01:29.015 --> 01:32.017
- Then send him home.
- We can ill afford to.

01:32.118 --> 01:34.252
He must raise a dowry
for our sister's betrothal.

01:34.320 --> 01:37.230
Four hundred thousand ducats is
hard to come by.

01:37.255 --> 01:38.423
You!

01:38.424 --> 01:41.359
[Muffled grunting]

01:41.427 --> 01:46.898

03:32.267 --> 03:36.170
Come hither!
Oh, degenerate church!

03:36.271 --> 03:39.173
I gave you my house,
saith the Lord,

03:39.240 --> 03:43.343
and you have defiled it
with outrage!

03:43.445 --> 03:47.981
This pope is a lecherous
abomination!

03:48.049 --> 03:54.321
Is there no crime for which
he has not been accused?

03:54.389 --> 03:58.492
He is lower than the beast
that crawls

03:58.560 --> 04:02.529

of Babylon!

04:02.597 --> 04:07.434
Florence, you will pay
for your greed and usury

04:07.535 --> 04:11.805
when he grinds you
to perdition!

04:17.745 --> 04:20.781
Oh, what was the illness
our dear Djem died of, brother?

04:20.882 --> 04:25.586
- Marsh fever.
- That he caught from our own swamps?

04:25.653 --> 04:27.788
I fear
I may have caught it too.

04:27.889 --> 04:29.890
No, my love.

04:29.958 --> 04:33.894
I think perhaps
you are sick with heartbreak.

04:33.995 --> 04:36.997
I think I shall never have
another friend like him.

04:38.967 --> 04:40.901
You will always have me.

04:45.106 --> 04:48.509
I have heard it whispered
by the maid servants

04:48.576 --> 04:50.711
that his estate paid
for my dowry.

04:50.812 --> 04:54.882
I think you know, my love, that
our father has funds enough.

04:54.949 --> 04:57.351
But...
if it were true, Cesare,

04:57.452 --> 04:59.887
I could never marry
this Giovanni Sforza,

04:59.954 --> 05:03.157
however handsome
he may be.

05:03.224 --> 05:06.360
Who told you
he was handsome?

05:06.427 --> 05:09.163
He is ugly, then?

05:09.264 --> 05:11.265
What a fate.

05:13.234 --> 05:15.102
He is far from ugly.

05:15.170 --> 05:19.106
He has his Sforza profile,
the nobility of bearing.

05:19.174 --> 05:24.178
And the Sforza armies.
And the castles.

05:24.245 --> 05:28.649
And all those things we all might gain
that will help our dear father's cause.

05:30.552 --> 05:32.653
You are learning fast,
Lucrezia.

05:32.720 --> 05:36.156
Not fast enough.

05:38.593 --> 05:42.196
Tell me again
what my dear Djem died of.

05:44.098 --> 05:46.366
Swamp fever.

05:46.467 --> 05:49.836
A mosquito...

05:49.904 --> 05:53.106
...killed my Moor.

06:01.449 --> 06:05.118
You would not lie
to me, brother?

06:06.921 --> 06:09.489
I think you should sleep now,
my love.

06:13.595 --> 06:16.563
Perhaps it's a mosquito
has bitten me.

06:27.709 --> 06:29.776
Do not fret,
Holy Father.

06:29.877 --> 06:31.812
I know my daughter.

06:31.879 --> 06:35.682
The illness is less in her body
than in her heart.

06:35.750 --> 06:38.118
- Well, she is--
- The changes of her state

06:38.219 --> 06:42.456
overwhelm her.
She is to be married soon.

06:42.523 --> 06:44.291
She's lost her blackamoor.

06:44.359 --> 06:48.295
Her father communes
only with God

06:48.396 --> 06:49.963
or with La Bella Farnese.

06:50.031 --> 06:52.032
Your tone is
hardly appropriate, madam.

06:52.133 --> 06:55.669
Forgive me, then,
my tone.

06:55.737 --> 06:59.773
But rest assured, I will nurse her
back to the most excellent health,

06:59.874 --> 07:02.376
and we will both have
the pleasure of seeing her walk

07:02.443 --> 07:05.579
up the aisle
of St. Peter's.

07:05.647 --> 07:08.148

we will not.

07:08.249 --> 07:10.517
Do not fret,
my love.

07:10.585 --> 07:14.588
I will nurse her back to health.
I promise. No, you misunderstand me.

07:14.689 --> 07:16.056
I do?

07:16.157 --> 07:20.694
We will not
both have that pleasure.

07:20.795 --> 07:22.496
Why not?

07:24.399 --> 07:27.100
The Sforza lineage is
a noble o.

07:27.168 --> 07:30.304
They have requested that
there be no...

07:30.371 --> 07:32.306
...hint of scandal.

07:32.373 --> 07:35.008
- You mean--
- I mean...

07:35.076 --> 07:36.843
...that you cannot attend.

07:36.944 --> 07:41.281
- Because...
- Because of your past!

07:41.349 --> 07:43.583
Oh... God!

07:43.685 --> 07:46.586
Well, if the whole
of Rome knows!

07:48.523 --> 07:50.724
- Do not do this.
- Look, I--

07:50.825 --> 07:54.361
- Do not do this, Rodrigo!
- A marriage such as this,

07:54.462 --> 07:57.364
with the attendance
of the royalty of Christendom--

07:57.444 --> 07:59.195
She is my only daughter!

07:59.220 --> 08:01.688
For one who is rumoured
to have been a courtesan

08:01.869 --> 08:04.371
to attend...
You're breaking my heart!

08:04.439 --> 08:07.174
- It is impossible.
- Would you break hers too?

08:07.275 --> 08:09.443
Shh, shh!

08:09.544 --> 08:11.345
I will make it up to you.

08:11.412 --> 08:13.447
How?

08:15.350 --> 08:17.818
[Sobbing]

08:26.794 --> 08:31.631
What is he, Micheletto?
Benedictine, or Franciscan?

08:31.699 --> 08:33.933
He belongs to a mendicant
order, Your Eminence.

08:34.001 --> 08:37.837
- Well, where is his begging bowl, then?
- He has yet to find one.

08:37.938 --> 08:39.472
But he will.

08:41.442 --> 08:44.745
So with his begging bowl,
he can travel to Florence.

08:44.812 --> 08:48.115
He can send you reports--
what he sees, what he hears.

08:48.216 --> 08:50.217
Then no killing?

08:50.318 --> 08:54.020
The scandal of your Naples
misadventure travelled wide.

08:54.088 --> 08:56.556
We must make do now
with information--

08:56.624 --> 09:00.093
about whom
Della Rovere meets,

09:00.161 --> 09:02.028
where he travels.

09:02.130 --> 09:06.833
Besides, monks do not kill.
No.

09:06.901 --> 09:10.637
They beg and they pray,
Your Eminence.

09:10.705 --> 09:13.640
Has he a name,
this mendicant?

09:16.444 --> 09:20.180
Giancarlo,
at Your Eminence's service.

09:28.656 --> 09:31.491
Your scars betray you.

09:33.661 --> 09:36.496
Keep yourself cowled.

09:41.436 --> 09:44.871
You look pale,

09:44.972 --> 09:48.041
Yes,

09:52.013 --> 09:54.681
My dusky friend inhabits
my dreams.

09:54.749 --> 09:58.585
Do not think so much
of Djem, my dear.

10:01.522 --> 10:05.792
He has a secret
that he cannot speak of.

10:05.893 --> 10:08.962
His beautiful dark mouth opens,
but no sounds come out.

10:09.063 --> 10:11.398
In your dreams?

10:13.334 --> 10:15.969
And I have to kiss those lips
to comfort them.

10:16.037 --> 10:19.039
- Oh, dear.
- Is it...

10:19.106 --> 10:21.842
...rmissible,
Donna Giulia,

10:21.943 --> 10:24.311
to kiss a dead Moor
in your dreams?

10:24.378 --> 10:28.215
All things are permissible
in our dreams.

10:37.658 --> 10:41.027
Look in the mirror,

10:41.128 --> 10:44.130
You yourself are dream enough
for anyone.

10:44.198 --> 10:47.667
I could be happy
in this dress.

10:47.735 --> 10:51.104
But I shall need lessons
in kissing.

10:51.172 --> 10:53.840
I shall soon have
to kiss the Lord Sforza.

10:55.810 --> 10:59.412
The dowry contract is
agreed.

10:59.480 --> 11:02.115
And Pesaro brings with it
5,000 horses

11:02.216 --> 11:03.683
and twice as many spears.

11:03.784 --> 11:06.319
A valuable addition indeed
to the papal armies.

11:06.387 --> 11:08.655

11:08.723 --> 11:10.690
...paltry alliance
of upstart dukes

11:10.791 --> 11:15.929
that Della Rovere cobbles together.
Perhaps.

11:15.997 --> 11:19.966

Would he dare France?

11:20.067 --> 11:22.869

11:22.937 --> 11:25.572
Hmm...

for our blessing

11:28.309 --> 11:32.512

to strengthen our ties

11:35.416 --> 11:38.585

like this one.

11:49.830 --> 11:52.599
That's easy.

11:52.700 --> 11:54.234
Then,

11:54.335 --> 11:57.070
there's the kiss
of pleasure,

11:57.171 --> 11:58.605
which begins to promise.

11:58.706 --> 12:00.240
You know them all?

12:00.341 --> 12:02.242
All of them.
There are many more.

12:23.130 --> 12:25.599
Did my mother kiss my father
thus?

12:25.666 --> 12:28.435
I would hazard
she did.

12:28.502 --> 12:30.604
And you,

12:30.671 --> 12:33.073
do you kiss him thus now?

12:38.145 --> 12:40.080
Let us adjust your dress.

12:40.147 --> 12:43.083
[Quiet chuckling]

12:45.319 --> 12:49.089
What colour have you chosen?
I thought a gown of apricot.

12:51.659 --> 12:54.594
My mother's favourite gown is
apricot.

12:54.662 --> 12:57.430
You must take care
not to outshine her.

12:57.498 --> 13:00.433
I'm afraid there's
no possibility of that.

13:00.501 --> 13:04.270
What do you mean?
You have advised her already?

13:06.173 --> 13:07.741
You haven't heard?

13:07.842 --> 13:09.976
[Sighing]
Another secret.

It is no secret.

What have I not heard?

13:18.653 --> 13:22.255
Your mother...

13:22.323 --> 13:24.824
...is not coming
to your wedding.

13:26.794 --> 13:29.029
Well, that is silly,
Giulia Farnese.

13:29.130 --> 13:30.930
Of course she's coming.

13:30.998 --> 13:33.099
I'm afraid your father has
deemed it otherwise.

- I must speak to him of this.

Ah, we're in here, Lucrezia.

13:47.948 --> 13:53.086
Oh! Ha-ha! Have you come
to show us your dress?

13:53.154 --> 13:56.656
Oh! It's more beautiful
than we could have imagined!

13:56.724 --> 13:59.359
You are the pope
of Rome.

13:59.427 --> 14:03.930
But surely not even the pope of Rome
can bar my mother from my wedding day?

14:07.668 --> 14:09.102
Oh, dear.

14:09.170 --> 14:12.839
I will gladly marry
whom you choose;

14:12.907 --> 14:15.575
what your politics demand.

14:15.676 --> 14:18.745
The Borgia family will be united
with the Sforzas,

14:18.846 --> 14:21.281
but however noble
their lineage,

14:21.348 --> 14:23.750
they cannot bar my mother
from my wedding day.

14:23.818 --> 14:27.587
No, but these are issues,
my dear daughter,

14:27.655 --> 14:31.391
that are beyond your care.
But I am learning, Holy Father!

14:31.459 --> 14:35.361
She was once what they call a courtesan,
and you are the pope of Rome.

14:35.463 --> 14:38.098
But you loved her
once.

14:38.165 --> 14:40.366
As I do now.

14:40.434 --> 14:44.838
And I will have my mother
at my wedding day.

14:51.345 --> 14:54.647
Come, sis. Let us talk
of these things elsewhere.

14:54.715 --> 14:58.184
Please, Holy Father!
I need you both there!

14:58.285 --> 15:01.354

and my father!

15:34.588 --> 15:37.323
Never was a woman
more wretched than myself

with such a husband.

15:41.729 --> 15:45.832

darling.

15:45.933 --> 15:47.009
I bid you good health. Uh,

15:47.011 --> 15:48.388
how are the good people
of the countryside?

15:49.603 --> 15:53.273
They do less mischief than
those in town, it would seem.

15:53.340 --> 15:57.477
Would your choice be
comedy or tragedy, my lord?

15:57.578 --> 15:59.879
It is my sister's wedding.

15:59.947 --> 16:01.614
I would see her smile.

16:01.682 --> 16:04.250
Ah! One of the comedies,
perhaps,

16:04.318 --> 16:07.020
of Terence or Plautus?
The difference between them?

16:07.121 --> 16:10.023
Um, the comedies
of Terence have refinement.

16:10.090 --> 16:12.025
Refinement.

16:12.092 --> 16:14.194
Refinement is good.
Yes.

16:14.261 --> 16:18.097
Those of Plautus are known
for their vulgarity.

16:18.199 --> 16:20.633
Vulgarity is better.

16:20.701 --> 16:25.104
Ah! He wrote of bawds,
pimps, courtesans.

16:25.206 --> 16:27.418
- Better still.
- Who is she?!

16:27.419 --> 16:28.150
She is...

16:28.175 --> 16:30.372
Do you want to know her name?
- Do you even know her name?

16:30.397 --> 16:31.597
No.

16:32.012 --> 16:33.847
[Laughing]

16:33.914 --> 16:36.816
[Della Rovere]: The wealth of
Florence astounds me, Don de Medici.

16:36.884 --> 16:38.518
Banking.

16:38.619 --> 16:41.588
The Medici family are bankers
to the world.

16:41.655 --> 16:43.356
To the Vatican itself.

16:43.424 --> 16:46.059
Ah, the Savonarola calls it
usury.

16:46.126 --> 16:47.894
And what do you call it?

16:47.962 --> 16:49.896
Interest.

16:49.964 --> 16:51.965
He may be wrong
about the Medici bank,

16:52.032 --> 16:54.334
but he's right
about the Borgia pope.

16:54.401 --> 16:57.804
Alexander's great game is
the investiture of Naples.

16:57.872 --> 17:00.273
He knows
France has claims upon it;

17:00.374 --> 17:02.809
he knows
Spain has claims upon it.

17:02.877 --> 17:06.145
He will play them both against each
other like a spider with two flies.

17:06.213 --> 17:08.448
And you...

17:08.549 --> 17:10.450
What is your game?

17:10.550 --> 17:12.518
I have no game.

17:12.586 --> 17:15.722
But,
if I am forced to play,

17:15.823 --> 17:17.991
I will head to France,

17:18.058 --> 17:22.896
and ask the French king
to invade our beautiful Italy.

17:24.765 --> 17:26.531
Italy?

17:26.599 --> 17:28.534
Is there such an entity?

17:28.602 --> 17:30.737
There is a land,
Señor Machiavelli,

17:30.838 --> 17:34.007
made up of many principalities--
the Duchy of Milan,

17:34.108 --> 17:36.442
the Republic
of your wondrous Florence,

17:36.510 --> 17:38.645
the dukedoms of the Romania,
the papal states--

17:38.746 --> 17:40.613
- And to their south,
Naples.

17:40.714 --> 17:43.316
Borgia has betrothed
his daughter to a Sforza.

17:43.384 --> 17:46.319
He will marry his son
to a Spaniard or a Venetian;

17:46.387 --> 17:49.789
his younger son
to a Florentine or a Neapolitan.

17:49.890 --> 17:52.358
He will weave a web
around this Italy

17:52.426 --> 17:56.062
that may not exist.
He will swallow your Florence,

17:56.163 --> 17:57.997
your Venice, your Milan,

17:58.098 --> 18:01.534
and Italy then will exist,
my liege, under him.

18:01.602 --> 18:03.336
Hmm.

18:03.437 --> 18:06.005
Prophetic words.

18:06.073 --> 18:09.642
Are you... cousin
to Savonarola?

18:09.743 --> 18:12.879
No.
But I would meet with him.

18:12.947 --> 18:14.881
I've seen him preach.

18:14.949 --> 18:17.050
Can you explain to me,
Cardinal,

18:17.117 --> 18:20.720
why the king of France would muster
an army and invade his neighbours?

18:20.821 --> 18:24.624
- Because he wants Naples.
- So you give France Naples,

18:24.725 --> 18:26.192
France gives you...

18:26.260 --> 18:28.428
...Rome?

18:28.495 --> 18:31.197
I don't want Rome;

18:31.298 --> 18:33.800
I want to restore the glory
of her holy church.

18:33.867 --> 18:36.002
[Machiavelli]: Hmm.

18:36.070 --> 18:38.237
As pope.

18:38.305 --> 18:40.907
As her humble servant.

18:41.008 --> 18:43.276
Indeed.

18:43.377 --> 18:46.112
And... what do you want
of Florence?

18:48.115 --> 18:49.615
Nothing.

18:52.353 --> 18:55.655
Well, then
we will charge you nothing.

18:55.756 --> 18:58.925
You misunderstand.
I ask

18:58.993 --> 19:02.195
that Florence do
nothing.

19:02.262 --> 19:05.164
Ah.

19:05.232 --> 19:12.939
We let those French barbarians march
through our principality and do...

19:13.040 --> 19:15.108
Nothing.

19:18.012 --> 19:21.080
That's a different kind
of nothing.

19:21.148 --> 19:23.649
That will cost you
something.

19:30.491 --> 19:33.726
[Door opening]
[Voice nearby]

19:33.794 --> 19:35.862
[Door closing]

19:38.665 --> 19:40.733
Have we a visitor?

19:40.801 --> 19:43.936
One who heard
of your distress.

19:44.004 --> 19:47.673
One who loved you
when you were younger.

19:47.775 --> 19:50.943
One who stepped aside
when asked.

19:51.011 --> 19:53.212
My God!

19:53.280 --> 19:55.314
Theo!

19:57.284 --> 20:01.220
And you've come as--
- Not as a lover, God forbid;

20:01.321 --> 20:05.491
as one once a husband;

20:05.559 --> 20:08.928
as a friend,
if I'm needed.

20:09.029 --> 20:13.633
[Sighing happily]
- How many years has it been?
- Oh, let us not talk of years.

20:13.700 --> 20:15.368
[Laughing]

20:24.178 --> 20:27.513
The pope would bar me,
Theo,

20:27.614 --> 20:29.715
from my own daughter's
wedding.

20:29.817 --> 20:33.719
As he barred me
from your life.

20:33.787 --> 20:36.522
But our love was
finished.

20:36.623 --> 20:40.693
A mother's love
for her daughter never dies.

20:43.630 --> 20:46.265
- If I can be
of any comfort--

20:46.366 --> 20:49.902
- And yet he would have
La Bella Farnese there--

20:50.003 --> 20:53.139
at his side,
before all of Rome.

20:53.207 --> 20:56.709
Can a pope make
his mistress public?

20:56.810 --> 21:01.347
- This pope can, and will.
- Well, she's noble;

21:01.448 --> 21:03.049
you're not.

21:03.117 --> 21:07.453
The nobility has its own laws,
its own rules, and we...

21:07.521 --> 21:11.357
...are commoners,
my dear.

21:13.827 --> 21:16.529
And we had common pleasures,
did we not?

21:16.630 --> 21:19.332
[Chuckling]

21:19.399 --> 21:21.334
Stay and dine with me,
Theo.

21:21.401 --> 21:25.538
Tell me
how your life has been.

21:25.606 --> 21:29.609
Old friends at times like
this are what one needs.

21:29.676 --> 21:31.711
[Borgia]: King Ferrante
of Naples?

21:31.778 --> 21:33.880
[Cesare]: He's too old
to attend.

21:33.947 --> 21:36.883
Well, his son, Alphonso?

21:36.950 --> 21:39.886
We must give him
pride of place.

21:39.953 --> 21:41.554
Um...

21:41.622 --> 21:44.390
Between the Salviatis
and the Colonnas, perhaps?

21:44.491 --> 21:46.626
And have them cut
each other's throats?

21:46.693 --> 21:49.362
An outcome
to be fervently desired, surely.

21:49.429 --> 21:52.732
Yes, but...
not in St. Peter's,

21:52.833 --> 21:55.368
and not
at our daughter's wedding.

21:55.469 --> 21:57.737
Where's the doge of Venice?

21:57.804 --> 22:01.741
By the Florentine ambassador,
Machiavelli.

22:01.808 --> 22:03.910
And have them plot
against us?

22:03.977 --> 22:05.978
They do that already,
Father.

22:06.046 --> 22:07.580
No...

22:07.648 --> 22:12.018
Venice shall go
by the...

22:12.085 --> 22:14.453
...Spanish ambassador.

22:16.757 --> 22:20.660
Florence next to the ambassador
from the Holy Roman Empire.

22:20.727 --> 22:23.196
Wise, indeed.

22:23.297 --> 22:25.765
But there is
one glaring omission, Father.

22:25.866 --> 22:27.300
There is?

22:27.367 --> 22:29.735
[Sighing]
Go over it again.

22:29.836 --> 22:31.904
My mother.

22:34.575 --> 22:38.644
So, at the front...
the Sforzas.

22:38.745 --> 22:41.814
And behind them,
Alfonso of Naples

22:41.915 --> 22:45.651
and Sancia of Naples.

22:49.990 --> 22:52.358
[Chuckling]

22:54.294 --> 22:57.296
I miss your company,
Vanozza.

23:00.167 --> 23:03.369
Your Eminence.

23:03.437 --> 23:06.639
Am I eminent to you?

23:06.707 --> 23:08.741
The husband
of my mother.

23:08.842 --> 23:11.377
- I should--
- Sounds like a riddle.

23:11.445 --> 23:15.982
If the husband of my mother is
not my father, then who is?

23:18.285 --> 23:20.186
I'm sorry,
you should what?

23:20.287 --> 23:22.054
Retire.

23:22.122 --> 23:25.091
Back to that farm
the pope bought for you?

23:25.158 --> 23:27.159
Oh, but he wasn't pope then,
was he?

23:27.227 --> 23:29.629
No, no, no,
sit, sit.

23:29.730 --> 23:32.265
We're all friends here.
I should hope so.

23:32.366 --> 23:34.600
And, if not,
family.

23:36.536 --> 23:40.640
To think
you could have been my father...

23:40.707 --> 23:43.442
I think not.

23:43.543 --> 23:45.778
Would I have been different,
mother?

23:45.846 --> 23:47.780
More at ease?

23:47.848 --> 23:50.883
Perhaps,
dare one say it,

23:50.951 --> 23:53.686
happy?

24:00.160 --> 24:02.561
Do you have shepherds
on your hills, Theo?

24:02.663 --> 24:05.831
Indeed,
Your... Eminence.

24:05.899 --> 24:08.334
Do they play the pipes
of Pan,

24:08.402 --> 24:09.831
as in Virgil's <i>Georgics?</i>

24:09.856 --> 24:12.286
<i>Do they fall in love</i>
<i>with shepherdesses?</i>

24:12.472 --> 24:14.440
They sleep on the
bare hillsides.

24:14.508 --> 24:18.110
In summer they scorch; in
winter they freeze. It is not

24:18.178 --> 24:21.080
a life
to be envied.

24:23.050 --> 24:26.452
<i>Et in Arcadia ego.</i>

24:26.520 --> 24:30.389
You must translate
for me, Your Eminence.

24:30.457 --> 24:32.358
I am a poor farmer.

24:32.426 --> 24:36.295
Death also is in paradise.

24:36.363 --> 24:40.966
- Cesare.
- I merely quote, Mother, from the great poet, Virgil.

24:41.034 --> 24:44.670
But speaking of paradise,
how is the betrothed one?

24:44.771 --> 24:47.306
She's better.
She's sleeping soundly.

24:47.374 --> 24:49.442
We must let her rest,
then.

24:51.411 --> 24:54.013
You, Theo, you must tell me
about sheep.

24:54.081 --> 24:55.915
Or goats.

25:00.487 --> 25:03.489
[Whispered praying]

25:11.598 --> 25:13.999
Father Savonarola.

25:14.067 --> 25:16.569
Who disturbs me
at matins?

25:16.670 --> 25:20.039
Cardinal Giuliano
Della Rovere, Friar.

25:20.107 --> 25:22.375
I know of you.

25:22.442 --> 25:26.312
From that cesspit
they call Rome.

25:26.413 --> 25:28.848
It was not
always thus;

25:28.915 --> 25:32.752
it was pure once,
and can be so again.

25:32.819 --> 25:34.387
You...

25:34.488 --> 25:37.857
You talk
of purity.

25:37.924 --> 25:40.559
Step into the light.

25:42.629 --> 25:45.664
I feel something
from you.

25:47.601 --> 25:51.203
[Bell tolling in the distance]

25:51.271 --> 25:54.507
I have had a vision,
Cardinal,

25:54.608 --> 25:57.576
of a great army
from the north,

25:57.677 --> 26:02.882
with cannon the like of which
we have never witnessed,

26:02.983 --> 26:06.485
belching fire
and destruction.

26:06.553 --> 26:10.389
Women lie dead
in their beds.

26:10.457 --> 26:15.161
Suckling babes will be snatched
from the breast and dashed

26:15.228 --> 26:18.431
against the city walls.

26:18.498 --> 26:21.333
This army...

26:21.401 --> 26:23.135
...will march south

26:23.203 --> 26:27.773
like the mongrel hordes
towards Rome,

26:27.841 --> 26:33.612
invited in
by a cleric in red.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.781
Are you the one,

26:35.849 --> 26:39.785
Cardinal Della Rovere?

26:39.853 --> 26:42.688
And in this vision
of yours,

26:42.756 --> 26:45.791
was the pope deposed?

26:45.859 --> 26:47.860
[Savonarola exhales slowly]

26:47.928 --> 26:51.664
I see castles
of flame.

26:51.731 --> 26:57.470
I see blood running through
the streets of cities.

26:57.537 --> 27:03.876
I see the bloated body
of the Borgia pope,

27:03.944 --> 27:06.745
blackened by syphilis,

27:06.813 --> 27:10.749
lying dead
in St. Peter's.

27:10.817 --> 27:14.487
Nobody dares
approach it.

27:14.554 --> 27:16.789
Will you be the one,

27:16.857 --> 27:22.328
Cardinal, to bring forth
this apocalypse?

27:22.429 --> 27:26.232
Are you the cleric
in red?

27:33.139 --> 27:36.208
[Chains rattling]

27:56.663 --> 28:00.533
[Borgia]: We understand
the royal Spanish highnesses...

28:00.634 --> 28:03.769
...wish us
to view this savage?

28:03.837 --> 28:06.705
- [Man]: Yes, Your Holiness.
- Brought back

28:06.806 --> 28:09.942
by Christopher Columbus
from the new continent?

28:10.010 --> 28:12.878
- [Man]: Yes, Your Holiness.
- I have heard rumours

28:12.946 --> 28:15.347
of cities of pure gold;

28:15.448 --> 28:17.950
of rivers running over beds
of precious stone.

28:18.018 --> 28:20.143
Can this savage tell us of them?

28:20.168 --> 28:23.422
We care little for silver
and gold, Cardinal Sforza.

28:23.490 --> 28:25.958
Our thoughts...

28:26.026 --> 28:30.062
...are with the souls
of its primitive inhabitants.

28:30.130 --> 28:33.499
Their salvation.
Indeed, Your Holiness.

28:33.567 --> 28:35.901
And we have here an example
of how knowledge

28:36.002 --> 28:40.873
of the one true God can enter
the most savage breast.

28:40.941 --> 28:42.641
Show us!

28:49.182 --> 28:51.283
Speak.

28:53.620 --> 28:56.922
<i>Credo in Unum Deum.</i>

28:59.960 --> 29:02.361
Hmm.

29:16.910 --> 29:19.645
What Eden
have they torn you from?

29:19.713 --> 29:21.714
Eden.

29:21.781 --> 29:23.749
[Chains rattling]

29:23.817 --> 29:26.518
It was a paradise,
Your Eminence.

29:28.655 --> 29:30.623
Was?

29:39.132 --> 29:43.936
Queen Isabella requests the pope's
blessing upon her American conquests.

29:44.037 --> 29:47.640
She would instruct these savage
peoples in the one true God.

29:47.741 --> 29:50.109
In return for?

29:50.210 --> 29:54.480
The support of Fernando and
Isabella of Spain for his papacy.

29:54.547 --> 29:57.282
The unreserved,

29:57.384 --> 30:00.219
unequivocal support?

30:00.286 --> 30:03.856
But of course.

30:03.957 --> 30:05.858
And what of Naples?

30:05.959 --> 30:09.461
Their Catholic Majesties would
expect Rome

30:09.529 --> 30:14.033
to support their traditional
claims on Naples.

30:17.070 --> 30:19.405
So, my Lord...

30:22.709 --> 30:28.213
I cannot invite such chaos
to my land

52:33.805 --> 52:35.125
Eager to hunt.

52:35.150 --> 52:37.900
Don't feed them.
I want them hungry for tomorrow.

52:38.710 --> 52:41.012
[Man]: Take my lady's horse.

52:43.482 --> 52:45.349
My lady.

52:45.417 --> 52:48.019
My thanks.

52:54.526 --> 52:56.560
That small vial.

52:59.331 --> 53:02.099
The red one.

53:02.167 --> 53:04.568
Poor it in the water.

53:08.673 --> 53:11.108
Softens the skin.

53:11.176 --> 53:13.444
Giulia told me.

53:13.512 --> 53:15.379
Giulia?

53:15.447 --> 53:17.381
Farnese.

53:17.449 --> 53:20.017
A great Roman beauty.

53:20.118 --> 53:22.186
You have heard of her?

53:26.992 --> 53:30.027
And my husband's hands...

53:30.128 --> 53:32.196
Will they be soft?

53:34.166 --> 53:37.034
They are hard,
my lady.

53:37.135 --> 53:39.236
What I have felt
of them.

53:39.337 --> 53:41.372
Hard?

53:43.308 --> 53:45.743
You have felt them?

53:45.811 --> 53:47.912
- When he beat me--

53:47.979 --> 53:50.347
hard, my lady.

53:53.118 --> 53:57.188
There will be no more beatings
now that I am your mistress.

54:27.419 --> 54:31.388
[Footsteps approaching]

54:43.768 --> 54:46.370
You wanted words.

54:46.438 --> 54:49.206
I have words.

54:49.274 --> 54:52.143
Words for what,
my lord?

54:52.244 --> 54:54.945
For that Borgia wedding.

54:58.450 --> 55:01.752
A farce.

55:01.820 --> 55:04.755
Travesty.

55:04.823 --> 55:06.490
A scandal.

55:09.995 --> 55:13.831
A public
humiliation.

55:15.667 --> 55:18.035
[Yelping in fear]

55:18.103 --> 55:19.970
Well, we're married now.

55:22.274 --> 55:24.875
[Lucrezia yelling in fear]
No!

55:24.976 --> 55:28.379
[Breathing in a panic]

55:28.446 --> 55:30.481
[Yelling in pain]

55:36.788 --> 55:38.789
[Sforza grunting]
