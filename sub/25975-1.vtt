WEBVTT

00:17.225 --> 00:19.227
[classical music playing]

00:21.479 --> 00:23.106
[Marty] So where do we live?

00:24.107 --> 00:25.650
[Wendy] Look who's getting
ahead of himself.

00:25.734 --> 00:26.985
[Marty] How about Luxembourg?

00:28.111 --> 00:30.530
[Wendy] That's the best you've got?
Luxembourg?

00:32.657 --> 00:34.492
-[Marty] How about Santorini?
-[Wendy] No.

00:34.576 --> 00:37.579
-[Marty] No? Some white sand beaches?
-[Wendy] Mnh-mnh.

00:37.662 --> 00:42.375
Tourists. Steep inclines. Donkeys.

00:42.459 --> 00:45.378
[chattering]

00:45.462 --> 00:48.506
[Marty] There's Slugworth. Who's he with?

00:49.090 --> 00:51.384
[Wendy] Steve Simmons,
chief compliance officer.

00:51.468 --> 00:54.637
-[Marty] Hmm. Someone's been studying.
-[Wendy] You're surprised?

00:56.139 --> 00:57.348
[Marty] Who are the other two?

00:57.432 --> 01:00.310
[Wendy] State attorney general
and Leslie Ann Mackey.

01:00.852 --> 01:03.521
She's the founder
of Missourians for Morality.

01:05.231 --> 01:08.026
[Marty] Hanging out with the other
Missourians is probably more fun.

01:08.109 --> 01:10.737
[Wendy] Okay, be nice and play nice.

01:12.697 --> 01:14.324
Hyannis Port?

01:16.242 --> 01:19.245
-Are we the Kennedys now?
-Please.

01:19.329 --> 01:22.957
What do you think it was starting out as
a bootlegger in the real world, actually?

01:23.792 --> 01:24.834
The Gold Coast?

01:27.128 --> 01:30.090
Australia, Wendy? Come on.

01:30.173 --> 01:32.258
Nobody'd be looking for us in Australia.

01:32.342 --> 01:34.260
Yeah. No shit.

01:39.724 --> 01:41.142
-You got him?
-Mm-hmm.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.773
-Is he alone?
-Mm-hmm.

01:48.399 --> 01:49.567
[Marty] Are you ready?

01:50.485 --> 01:51.611
[Wendy] Mm-hmm.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.198
-Good luck.
-Mm-hmm.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.813
[Darlene] Jacob's angry with me.
I can tell.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.525
[sighs] Just feels different.

02:35.947 --> 02:39.492
I think maybe
I shouldn't have killed this Mexican.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.663
[Ash] The man disrespected you
in your own home.

02:46.416 --> 02:47.834
[grunts]

02:47.917 --> 02:50.461
Now, you know how much I admire Mr. Snell.

02:54.340 --> 02:55.967
[Darlene] Speak your mind, child.

02:57.051 --> 02:59.345
[Ash] Sometimes you have to agree
to disagree.

03:04.142 --> 03:05.393
That's part of the covenant.

03:07.812 --> 03:11.774
You're a sweet boy, Ash. You know that?

03:41.346 --> 03:42.513
[Jacob] Wendy.

03:43.264 --> 03:48.102
Jacob Snell. My wife, Darlene.
Our associate Ash.

03:48.186 --> 03:51.064
-[Darlene] Fresh from our hives.
-Thank you.

03:51.147 --> 03:51.981
Hi, there.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.984
-A moment?
-Yeah. Excuse me.

03:57.445 --> 04:00.573
-I take it she knows your business.
-Uh, yeah.

04:02.116 --> 04:06.704
Tricky thing, combining work and marriage,
but a blessing when it works.

04:06.788 --> 04:07.872
That's true.

04:08.748 --> 04:11.834
You have the keys
to our Mexican friend's vehicle?

04:11.918 --> 04:16.798
Yeah. Here you go. It's parked
around the bend, off the road a bit.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.759
Ash will drive it to Chicago.

04:19.842 --> 04:22.929
He's got the man's cell phone
and his credit cards.

04:23.012 --> 04:25.932
Okay. Just make sure you swipe one
of them when you get up there.

04:26.474 --> 04:28.142
As far the world will know,

04:28.226 --> 04:31.354
the man drove to Chicago
and fell off the face of God's Earth.

04:31.437 --> 04:35.024
Yeah, yeah. I left, like, three messages
on his cell phone.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.443
Call me back when you get there.
Make sure the cell towers--

04:37.527 --> 04:41.906
-This is a drill we're familiar with.
-Uh-huh. Okay. See you.

04:42.532 --> 04:45.994
[Darlene] You buckle up! Drive safe.

04:52.166 --> 04:55.753
Things happen.
You apologize and you move on.

04:57.547 --> 04:58.798
She blew a man's head off.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.093
For which she is contrite.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.639
Am I supposed to believe that?

05:07.598 --> 05:10.101
-The woman brought you fresh honey.
-Mm-hmm.

05:15.189 --> 05:16.566
[door opens]

05:24.073 --> 05:25.074
[exhales]

05:26.701 --> 05:28.119
Clean sheets again.

05:31.956 --> 05:33.666
I thought I'd feel different.

05:35.418 --> 05:38.338
Like we went around the world,
came back and everything had changed.

05:40.214 --> 05:41.674
I know that sounds stupid.

05:44.385 --> 05:49.515
I wouldn't have been as brave as you were
when that fucker was in the living room.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.185
I wouldn't have been able
to pull the trigger.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.313
Yes, you would have.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.903
I keep thinking about it.

06:04.489 --> 06:05.990
I would have just frozen.

06:11.496 --> 06:12.997
Mom told me to.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.257
Figured you should have half.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.598
Took it the night
we were putting it in the wall.

06:31.599 --> 06:33.059
I don't even know why I did it.

06:35.895 --> 06:38.606
-How much is it?
-Ten thousand.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.444
You think I should tell Mom and Dad?

06:44.028 --> 06:44.862
No.

06:48.658 --> 06:49.826
We might need it.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.538
[Charlotte sighs]

06:59.710 --> 07:01.963
[door opens and closes]

07:03.339 --> 07:05.842
[Ruth] I used to not even think
about the future.

07:07.051 --> 07:08.469
Because, you know...

07:09.720 --> 07:10.888
what was the point?

07:12.515 --> 07:17.645
So I'd get mad or get into trouble.

07:22.608 --> 07:24.986
But in the last few months, I've been...

07:26.654 --> 07:29.031
I've been tryin' to be a better person.

07:31.200 --> 07:35.746
Think about people besides just myself.

07:37.623 --> 07:40.334
You know, I got a real job,

07:41.461 --> 07:43.963
one with insurance and everything, and...

07:45.548 --> 07:50.386
I'm looking after two boys,
and I'm even thinking about their futures.

07:53.055 --> 07:53.890
[inhales]

07:55.141 --> 07:58.227
But I know I gotta keep myself right.

07:59.645 --> 08:02.148
Because if I don't, I'll lose everything.

08:06.486 --> 08:10.156
And I don't think any
of that would be possible

08:11.491 --> 08:13.576
if it wasn't for my dad.

08:13.659 --> 08:14.994
[breathes deeply]

08:20.249 --> 08:23.002
I've been coming
to visit him regular and...

08:25.254 --> 08:27.882
And I know how bad he wants to do good.

08:29.258 --> 08:31.302
Thank you, Miss Langmore.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.097
Though it's important
for this parole board

08:35.181 --> 08:37.183
to consider the inmate's character,

08:37.266 --> 08:41.270
it's also important to consider
the question, "Why now?"

08:45.191 --> 08:46.192
Yes, ma'am.

08:49.445 --> 08:50.696
[Ruth] <i>Like I said,</i>

08:51.697 --> 08:56.744
<i>I'm becoming the guardian of two boys,</i>
<i>my cousins,</i>

08:56.827 --> 08:59.705
<i>who recently lost their dad.</i>

09:02.250 --> 09:04.460
<i>And I'm tryin' my best every day.</i>

09:06.295 --> 09:08.214
<i>But I'm just a young girl.</i>

09:11.342 --> 09:13.803
<i>I know what it means to need a daddy.</i>

09:32.697 --> 09:33.614
[Tuck] Hey, Marty!

09:34.991 --> 09:36.701
Hey, Tuck. What's going on?

09:37.451 --> 09:42.415
Everything's locked.
Down here and by the front door, too.

09:42.498 --> 09:44.208
Yeah? Did you try Rachel?

09:44.292 --> 09:47.837
It goes straight to her voicemail.
Just like yesterday.

09:48.921 --> 09:51.591
-Yesterday, too, huh?
-Yes.

09:57.221 --> 10:00.558
-Um, is your mom and sister home?
-Yes.

10:00.641 --> 10:03.644
Why don't you head home? I'll call you
when I need you for work, okay?

10:03.728 --> 10:04.770
Okay.

10:14.655 --> 10:15.990
[breathes deeply]

10:17.199 --> 10:18.159
Fuck!

10:55.946 --> 10:57.281
-[Harry] Mrs. Byrde?
-Oh.

10:58.157 --> 11:00.618
[chuckles] Harry, you scared me.

11:00.701 --> 11:03.954
-Can I help you with something?
-Yes.

11:04.038 --> 11:07.750
I was wondering. Why do we use the freezer

11:07.833 --> 11:10.294
when embalmed bodies don't need
to be refrigerated?

11:12.046 --> 11:13.047
Coolers.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.758
[Wendy] I'm sorry.

11:15.841 --> 11:19.637
They're called coolers, not freezers.
In the funeral game.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.013
That notwithstanding,

11:21.097 --> 11:24.600
I think we could save an enormous amount
of money on refrigeration costs

11:24.684 --> 11:27.311
if we turned the coolers
into storage units.

11:30.147 --> 11:31.148
I'll buy the locks myself.

11:32.066 --> 11:33.067
[Harry] Of course.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.028
Also, I was thinking...

11:36.112 --> 11:38.906
We should probably buy some more caskets.

11:38.989 --> 11:41.534
In bulk. To save money. Say 25?

11:46.664 --> 11:49.041
-I need to borrow the hearse.
-I'm sorry.

11:50.543 --> 11:55.464
We have a terminally ill tenant.
He wants to test drive his final ride.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.468
That's okay, isn't it?

12:00.469 --> 12:01.470
Well...

12:02.096 --> 12:05.891
[stammering] it's all highly unusual.

12:09.145 --> 12:09.979
Hmm.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.242
Don't seem so fucking glad to see me.

12:24.201 --> 12:25.661
I'm expecting somebody else.

12:26.912 --> 12:28.456
I've been callin'.

12:28.539 --> 12:29.749
And I've been busy.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.669
We need to talk about my future.

12:35.671 --> 12:37.840
I can't talk right now, okay?

12:37.923 --> 12:40.634
Wyatt's got to go to college.
You have any idea what college costs?

12:40.718 --> 12:42.386
-Yeah, I got a pretty good idea.
-A shit ton.

12:42.470 --> 12:44.972
-I'm serious. This is not a good time
-A shit ton.

12:45.055 --> 12:46.807
for us to talk, okay?

12:50.436 --> 12:55.274
I was thinkin', you and me,
we could be partners.

12:56.692 --> 12:58.527
What I meant was, not now.

12:59.487 --> 13:00.446
No, stay in the car.

13:00.529 --> 13:03.991
At least I can get a percentage!
I think I fucking earned it, Marty!

13:04.074 --> 13:07.119
-You gotta pump the brakes a bit--
-I'm not fucking stupid!

13:07.203 --> 13:12.124
I know that the cartels are gonna
eventually dump another pile

13:12.208 --> 13:13.876
of shit money on you!

13:16.378 --> 13:17.296
We'll see.

13:19.215 --> 13:23.844
We'll see. I promise we'll talk, okay?
I promise.

13:27.848 --> 13:29.141
Nice whip.

13:33.354 --> 13:36.440
-What was that about?
-Her uncles.

13:40.736 --> 13:42.363
Any idea how much she took?

13:42.822 --> 13:44.865
No. We're just gonna have to
count it all

13:44.949 --> 13:48.118
and pray to God we can absorb the loss
without the cartel finding out.

13:48.202 --> 13:49.912
It's gonna take half the night
to move all this.

13:49.995 --> 13:53.332
Yeah, well, she fucked us.
She fucked us and now she's...

13:55.125 --> 13:56.585
She fucked us.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.295
What did you tell the kids?

13:59.213 --> 14:02.383
Just that we had to work late,
not to stay up. Buddy's with them.

14:05.469 --> 14:09.139
Wendy, I know.
I know. Let's just get started.

14:38.669 --> 14:39.503
Hey.

14:40.796 --> 14:41.755
Hey.

14:44.091 --> 14:46.343
-I'm just gonna be in here, all right?
-Yeah, I'll be right over.

14:47.803 --> 14:48.721
Hey.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.139
What?

14:52.933 --> 14:54.143
I hope you're using a rubber.

14:55.311 --> 14:57.605
Come on, it's not like that.
We just hang out.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.357
Fixing it up for your dad?

15:01.317 --> 15:02.318
Yeah.

15:04.194 --> 15:05.446
It's gonna be okay.

15:06.363 --> 15:10.492
I know. I just want him to have
a nice place. [chuckles]

15:11.327 --> 15:12.286
Start straight.

15:12.369 --> 15:14.455
Well, just saying you're not alone.

15:23.547 --> 15:26.425
[growling]

15:30.679 --> 15:32.139
You dicks go to bed.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.773
[Jonah] Have you seen
my humanities folder?

15:40.856 --> 15:42.942
[Wendy] It's next to the TV.

15:43.025 --> 15:45.277
[Marty] Guys, tell me one more time
where you were last week

15:45.361 --> 15:46.445
when you were out of school.

15:46.528 --> 15:48.364
[Charlotte] At a funeral
in North Carolina.

15:48.447 --> 15:49.531
[Marty] Yep. For who?

15:51.575 --> 15:53.911
-Great-Aunt Tyra.
-[Marty] Yep.

15:54.662 --> 15:57.414
[Charlotte] Think we could start making
chai instead of coffee?

15:57.498 --> 16:00.376
Maybe matcha?
You know, something macrobiotic.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.462
-Do we even have a Great-Aunt Tyra?
-Yeah, unfortunately.

16:03.545 --> 16:07.591
Before you ask, don't worry.
I'll replace your phone this afternoon.

16:07.675 --> 16:11.470
Guys, this is a new baseline, okay?
We're gonna build normal from here.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.055
We're out of danger?

16:13.389 --> 16:17.935
Uh, yes. But everything from now on
needs to be about keeping it that way.

16:18.018 --> 16:20.479
Which means we need 100% honesty.

16:20.562 --> 16:23.107
Like our lives depend on it.
You understand that?

16:26.068 --> 16:27.069
Yeah.

16:28.904 --> 16:31.448
-Why is Buddy here?
-Buddy's not deaf.

16:31.532 --> 16:34.493
Buddy's gonna oversee the installation
of a security system this morning.

16:34.576 --> 16:36.328
Plus, we need to get that window replaced.

16:36.412 --> 16:40.165
Yeah, next time I'll aim lower,
shoot 'em in the ball sack,

16:40.249 --> 16:42.001
avoid the shattered glass.

16:42.543 --> 16:43.836
What happened to the body?

16:44.503 --> 16:47.089
We took it to the funeral parlor.
We cremated it.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.465
[Charlotte] What funeral parlor?

16:49.133 --> 16:50.884
I bought one before we left town.

16:51.677 --> 16:52.845
You bought a funeral parlor?

16:52.928 --> 16:54.138
-[Wendy] Uh-huh.
-[cellphone chiming]

16:54.221 --> 16:55.556
Have you killed other people?

16:55.639 --> 16:57.391
-Of course not.
-We do not kill people.

16:57.474 --> 16:59.977
Guys, that's it. Please, to school.
Learning. Hello.

17:01.854 --> 17:02.688
Yeah.

17:04.148 --> 17:04.982
Okay.

17:08.110 --> 17:09.361
I understand.

17:10.446 --> 17:11.572
Yeah, bye.

17:13.949 --> 17:15.200
[Charlotte] Is everything okay?

17:16.660 --> 17:17.953
Total honesty.

17:18.996 --> 17:24.376
Yeah, everything's great. In fact,
our casino project has its first meeting.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.505
Oh. They're here.

17:30.299 --> 17:31.842
All right. Everyone in the car.

17:37.014 --> 17:38.724
They should have come to us.

17:40.517 --> 17:42.144
This is neutral territory.

17:43.312 --> 17:46.148
It's a lack of respect and trust,
is what it is.

17:47.441 --> 17:53.280
Well, just... Everybody stay calm, okay?
This is a simple business arrangement.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.909
All of life's
a simple business arrangement.

17:57.367 --> 17:59.620
That's why you prepare for anything.

18:22.976 --> 18:24.895
-You must be Marty Byrde.
-Yeah.

18:24.978 --> 18:26.855
Helen Pierce.
I'm the attorney for your employer.

18:29.566 --> 18:32.027
Jacob Snell. My wife Darlene.

18:37.407 --> 18:38.700
Where's Del?

18:40.744 --> 18:42.287
I was hoping you could tell me.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.624
Oh. Uh...

18:46.542 --> 18:47.835
I assumed he'd be here.

18:51.505 --> 18:55.134
We can't seem to locate him.
Last we heard, he was in Chicago.

18:55.968 --> 18:59.221
Okay. Well, what does that mean?

19:00.264 --> 19:01.765
[Helen] It means we endeavor without him.

19:03.142 --> 19:06.353
Trust me when I tell you that
my client has a very deep bench.

19:08.355 --> 19:09.189
Yeah.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.859
Should we go inside?
Discuss things more casually?

19:13.485 --> 19:14.486
Good.

19:17.197 --> 19:19.950
<i>My client is prepared to offer</i>
<i>an 80-20 split.</i>

19:20.909 --> 19:22.119
[Darlene] <i>In whose favor?</i>

19:24.079 --> 19:30.419
Seems to me that 80-20 in either direction
doesn't exactly speak to a partnership.

19:31.420 --> 19:34.798
My client appreciates what a project
this size must mean for you.

19:35.215 --> 19:38.719
You're donating your land,
but he's the one incurring all the risk.

19:38.802 --> 19:40.554
-[Darlene] His risk?
-That's right.

19:41.138 --> 19:42.723
From a pueblo in Mexico.

19:43.307 --> 19:44.766
Financial risk.

19:44.850 --> 19:48.312
Well, there's certainly plenty of risk
to go around.

19:48.896 --> 19:52.024
Not to mention the potential loss
of reputation to my client

19:52.107 --> 19:54.735
if he distributes
a product that's inferior.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.030
In...

20:00.115 --> 20:04.578
[chuckles] I've been patient,
and I have been respectful.

20:08.373 --> 20:11.627
I suggest you do the same
when you're talkin' about my business.

20:13.378 --> 20:17.007
I am simply suggesting
that all farms are unique.

20:17.424 --> 20:18.675
Quality can vary.

20:20.469 --> 20:21.386
Uh-huh.

20:26.892 --> 20:29.645
That can be tested, right? The quality?

20:30.395 --> 20:33.190
Quite frankly,
my client and I both have doubts

20:33.273 --> 20:35.442
you can even deliver this casino.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.778
Okay. Why is that?

20:37.861 --> 20:40.614
'Cause Missouri has a cap on the number
of casinos allowed to open?

20:41.406 --> 20:45.035
[Helen] Or the fact that the casino has
to be actually physically completed

20:45.118 --> 20:46.912
before a bid can be approved?

20:46.995 --> 20:49.581
Which creates a huge financial risk
for most people,

20:49.665 --> 20:54.670
but provides an opportunity
to move cash for us.

20:54.753 --> 20:58.674
Don't forget about the political campaign
needed to overturn that cap.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.843
It would take a seasoned pro, right?

21:02.261 --> 21:05.055
Someone like, say, my wife.

21:06.556 --> 21:11.186
So, my job is to deliver a casino.
I can do that.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.771
You just need to make a fair deal.

21:17.359 --> 21:20.237
And to be clear,
I'm gonna be taking 3% of the profits.

21:20.570 --> 21:22.781
Okay? That's my customary fee.

21:22.864 --> 21:25.284
I don't want anyone to think I'm being
anything less than transparent.

21:26.827 --> 21:30.038
You do realize you're betting everything
on being able to pull this off.

21:30.664 --> 21:33.166
Yeah.
Six months you're gonna have a casino.

21:37.212 --> 21:39.214
Let me ask you, for the record,

21:39.298 --> 21:42.092
did Del say anything to you
about going to Chicago?

21:43.010 --> 21:43.844
No.

21:43.927 --> 21:46.888
Because he was scheduled
on a private jet to Mexico City.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.266
Changing plans would have been
a breach of trust.

21:50.100 --> 21:52.769
My client is a man
who demands absolute trust,

21:52.853 --> 21:54.604
as I'm sure you can appreciate.

21:55.605 --> 21:56.940
Of course.

21:57.024 --> 22:01.278
Don't fuck with me.
And don't fuck with my client. Understand?

22:03.780 --> 22:05.407
They'll kill your children.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.451
They'll gut your fucking wife.

22:09.870 --> 22:12.122
Do you want me to tell you
what they'll do to you?

22:16.335 --> 22:17.502
Okay.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.340
This was productive.

22:26.762 --> 22:27.763
[Wendy] Well?

22:29.806 --> 22:32.351
The last they heard, Del was in Chicago.

22:32.893 --> 22:34.770
[Wendy exhales]

22:38.607 --> 22:40.400
11:30 in the morning.

22:42.611 --> 22:45.489
Now we just have to pull off
opening a fucking casino.

22:54.247 --> 22:56.249
[upbeat music playing]

23:04.132 --> 23:06.635
[Rose] I don't wanna get
a bitch in trouble,

23:06.718 --> 23:10.055
but Cheyenne, she's turning tricks
in the VIP room again.

23:18.688 --> 23:19.815
[Cheyenne moaning]

23:19.898 --> 23:21.983
-What the fuck? Get off!
-[Cheyenne screams]

23:22.067 --> 23:23.652
[yells]

23:23.735 --> 23:24.861
[Ruth] What the fuck?

23:24.945 --> 23:26.738
What the fuck, you fat ass?

23:26.822 --> 23:29.116
My dick don't bend that way, you bitch!

23:29.199 --> 23:31.827
What the fuck, Barry?
Why are you full-on naked?

23:31.910 --> 23:33.912
She should be the one getting naked!
Not you!

23:33.995 --> 23:36.832
What the fuck are you
putting your T-shirt on first?

23:36.915 --> 23:39.334
Get your pants on. Get your pants on!

23:39.418 --> 23:44.297
-Fucking pig! Get out! Get out! Fuck! Ugh!
-Sorry. Sorry!

23:44.840 --> 23:46.925
Hey, hey! Wait, wait!

23:47.008 --> 23:49.386
You're so desperate for money,
you come to me.

23:49.469 --> 23:51.888
I'm not gonna have a $5,000 fine on my ass

23:51.972 --> 23:54.266
so you can fuck
some dumb ginger hillbilly.

23:54.349 --> 23:56.226
-Do you understand?
-Yeah.

23:56.309 --> 23:59.062
Okay, good. Get the fuck out of here!

24:01.565 --> 24:02.524
Wait a minute.

24:06.236 --> 24:07.487
Are you clean?

24:11.366 --> 24:14.369
Listen, I'm giving you the opportunity
to introduce legislation

24:14.453 --> 24:17.664
that could lead to a brand-new casino
in your district.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.542
You got any idea how much I make
as a state senator?

24:21.209 --> 24:24.963
[Marty] I do, yeah. $35,914 per year.

24:25.046 --> 24:29.342
Plus $104 per day in per diem
if you show up at roll call.

24:30.218 --> 24:31.595
[Mercer] Which is why
we all have other jobs.

24:31.678 --> 24:32.512
[Marty] Yeah.

24:32.596 --> 24:33.847
[Mercer] I ain't doing it to get rich.

24:33.930 --> 24:36.558
I'm doing it for the people
in this district.

24:36.641 --> 24:38.643
[Marty] Right. A new casino
would yield about

24:38.727 --> 24:42.105
a thousand new jobs per year
for the people of your district.

24:42.189 --> 24:43.648
[Mercer] And the crime that'd follow?

24:46.276 --> 24:49.446
Well, listen, we're planning
to build completely locally.

24:49.529 --> 24:52.365
We'll use only vendors from the community.

24:52.449 --> 24:54.034
Like, say, your local lumber.

24:54.659 --> 24:56.453
I take it you've been to the lake house.

24:57.662 --> 24:59.331
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-[chuckles]

25:00.415 --> 25:01.958
Come back and talk to me when you do.

25:02.584 --> 25:04.711
Have a good one. [chuckles]

25:19.518 --> 25:21.853
Yeah, this one's fine now.

25:22.020 --> 25:24.689
-Check out the one in the back again.
-In the back?

25:24.773 --> 25:26.399
Yeah, the back.

25:26.483 --> 25:28.109
I just got off the phone
with Jack and Sylvie

25:28.193 --> 25:29.402
from the Cavanaugh campaign.

25:30.028 --> 25:32.822
They said the lake house is exactly that.

25:32.906 --> 25:34.199
It's the second home

25:34.282 --> 25:37.035
of a wealthy businessman
from Kansas City named Charles Wilkes.

25:37.118 --> 25:39.496
He made a fortune
in agricultural equipment.

25:39.746 --> 25:41.373
-Wilkes.
-Mm-hmm.

25:46.294 --> 25:47.796
Gonna make me ask you?
I know you got more.

25:48.547 --> 25:51.007
Missouri is the only state in our union

25:51.091 --> 25:53.510
that has no limit
on personal campaign contributions.

25:53.593 --> 25:55.554
Which means someone like Wilkes

25:55.637 --> 25:57.931
can virtually run state government
based on who he backs.

25:58.014 --> 25:59.808
If you want to get something done,
you go to--

25:59.891 --> 26:02.644
You go to the lake house. Yeah.
What's this guy's politics?

26:02.727 --> 26:04.312
-Not ours.
-Not ours.

26:05.522 --> 26:09.609
Charles Wilkes is a union-busting,
right-to-work toolbag.

26:10.443 --> 26:14.906
Though he does have a couple of things
on social issues worth listening to.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.366
[Wendy] Like I said, not ours.

26:17.075 --> 26:18.535
Yeah, I'm gonna ignore that.

26:19.286 --> 26:21.121
[Marty chuckles]

26:21.204 --> 26:24.165
His office laughed me off the line
when I asked for an appointment.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.668
What about if we use
your real estate connections

26:26.751 --> 26:28.420
to locate the lake house?

26:29.254 --> 26:31.715
Sure, but it's off-season.
He's probably never there.

26:31.798 --> 26:34.134
And even if he was,
what are we supposed to do?

26:34.217 --> 26:35.510
Camp on his front yard?

26:35.594 --> 26:36.595
Yeah, well...

26:37.679 --> 26:39.055
how the hell are we gonna get to him?

26:48.273 --> 26:49.691
[snoring]

26:51.234 --> 26:53.862
[alarm blaring]

27:00.660 --> 27:01.494
[rifle cocks]

27:03.204 --> 27:05.624
-[Charlotte] Don't shoot!
-[Wendy] Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

27:05.707 --> 27:08.460
My God, Charlotte!
I could have killed you!

27:08.543 --> 27:10.128
[Charlotte] I forgot the code!

27:10.211 --> 27:13.632
[Wendy] I could have killed you!
The code is your birthday!

27:13.715 --> 27:15.216
I forgot it! I'm sorry!

27:15.300 --> 27:16.676
[Marty] What the hell are you even doing
out of the house?

27:16.760 --> 27:18.428
It's not past my curfew!

27:18.511 --> 27:20.472
-[Wendy] We didn't even know you were out.
-[alarm stops]

27:20.555 --> 27:23.683
I need to know where you are,
where both of you are.

27:23.767 --> 27:26.561
Every second of every day.
You understand that?

27:26.645 --> 27:28.355
-So like prisoners?
-No, not like prisoners.

27:28.438 --> 27:30.231
-Get to bed, please.
-Then like what?

27:30.315 --> 27:31.650
Like people we're trying to keep safe.

27:31.983 --> 27:34.361
-[Jonah] But you said we were safe.
-We are. We are.

27:34.444 --> 27:35.945
-[Jonah] You just said that--
-I know what I said.

27:36.029 --> 27:38.823
It doesn't make sense! We're free,
but you want us locked inside.

27:38.907 --> 27:41.284
-You wanna know where we are every second.
-[Marty] Calm down.

27:41.368 --> 27:44.579
We came back because this was the only way
for all of us to live a life.

27:44.663 --> 27:47.874
I know it's not fair,
but we need six months.

27:49.709 --> 27:53.004
We know you love us and we know
you just want to keep us safe,

27:54.297 --> 27:55.924
but none of this would make any difference

27:56.007 --> 27:57.801
if somebody really wanted us dead.

27:57.884 --> 27:59.844
Listen, your mother and I have a plan.

27:59.928 --> 28:02.138
We need six months.
That's all we're asking for.

28:02.222 --> 28:05.016
Once the casino's open,
we can move anywhere in the world.

28:05.100 --> 28:08.520
Until then, we got to know
where you are. That's it.

28:08.603 --> 28:09.896
If you'll excuse me,

28:10.647 --> 28:14.901
I'm gonna wash down
some heart medicine with a large bourbon.

28:14.984 --> 28:16.569
Good night, Buddy. Sorry.
Good night, Jonah.

28:16.653 --> 28:18.446
[Wendy] Where were you, anyway?

28:18.530 --> 28:20.699
-I was just with Wyatt.
-Great.

28:23.076 --> 28:25.286
We have a plan to get out of here
in six months?

28:25.370 --> 28:27.038
[Marty] We got 3% of the profits.

28:27.122 --> 28:29.249
[Wendy] Yeah, but you know what happens
if we skim.

28:29.332 --> 28:30.458
[Marty] We're not skimming.
It's our money.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.168
I told 'em straight up, we have 3%.

28:32.711 --> 28:35.672
I hit one button,
and it disappears into offshore oblivion.

28:36.381 --> 28:39.259
Once the casino's open,
the laundering becomes self-sufficient

28:39.342 --> 28:41.678
and it'll be months
before they know we're gone.

28:41.761 --> 28:44.597
We just need to decide
where in the world we want to disappear.

28:46.141 --> 28:47.559
[breathes deeply]

28:50.270 --> 28:51.271
[Marty] I disagree.

28:51.354 --> 28:55.984
I think that this place has substantial
investment holdings. It's perfect.

28:56.067 --> 28:59.070
[Wendy] A couple of movers could help make
that point right about now.

28:59.154 --> 29:01.030
[Marty chuckles] We're almost done.

29:01.114 --> 29:02.073
[door opens]

29:02.657 --> 29:05.493
Is that something I gotta sign for?
Can you just leave it up front?

29:11.541 --> 29:12.459
Hi.

29:13.918 --> 29:15.170
[Wendy] Hi, can I help you?

29:16.880 --> 29:18.631
[man] This is a nice space.

29:19.507 --> 29:20.633
Lake view.

29:22.135 --> 29:25.889
I hope the lease isn't predicated
on you actually opening a casino.

29:28.349 --> 29:29.976
You did speak to a state senator

29:30.059 --> 29:32.854
about lifting the casino cap
from 13 to 14.

29:34.773 --> 29:37.358
Uh, it was a preliminary conversation.

29:37.859 --> 29:41.571
Well, I'll save you the legwork.
That bill will never reach the floor.

29:43.156 --> 29:45.992
Is that your opinion, or...

29:47.202 --> 29:48.703
does it belong to Charles Wilkes?

29:51.998 --> 29:53.374
We don't know you.

29:58.254 --> 30:01.508
Well, that's understandable.

30:01.591 --> 30:03.635
Maybe we can talk you through some
of our--

30:03.718 --> 30:07.138
Martin Byrde, Indiana State University.
Founder of Liddell and Byrde.

30:07.222 --> 30:09.682
Whose co-founder,
Bruce Liddell, went missing

30:09.766 --> 30:13.895
just after the business was liquidated
and you moved to Osage Beach,

30:14.479 --> 30:18.233
where you serve as an angel investor
in one gentlemen's club,

30:18.316 --> 30:21.152
one sleepy resort and one funeral home.

30:22.153 --> 30:25.657
Thereby hitting for the sex,
nap, death cycle.

30:27.075 --> 30:28.785
It's not that we don't know you.

30:29.410 --> 30:30.703

[car engine stops]

32:01.127 --> 32:02.545
Why'd you do it?

Do what?

32:07.508 --> 32:08.509
Don't.

32:14.015 --> 32:15.558
Russ was a fucking rat.

32:17.560 --> 32:18.603
Bullshit.

32:22.148 --> 32:23.524
This was in his trailer.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.528
He was asking me all sorts of questions

32:27.612 --> 32:30.365
about stealing money
and killing Marty Byrde.

32:35.578 --> 32:36.788
You say anything?

32:40.166 --> 32:41.376
I didn't say shit.

32:49.842 --> 32:51.678
They were my fucking brothers.

32:57.684 --> 32:59.560
I'm your fucking daughter.

33:03.106 --> 33:05.108
I don't know who he was working with,

33:06.067 --> 33:10.363
but he was gonna pin me for fucking murder
and he was on his way to do it.

33:26.087 --> 33:28.381
Next time, get me a fucking blonde.

33:55.616 --> 33:56.617
[Wendy] Hello.

33:57.285 --> 33:58.536
Are you Sister Alice?

33:58.619 --> 34:00.788
-Yes, Mrs. Byrde, please sit.
-Thank you.

34:00.872 --> 34:03.416
[Alice] You were trying
to find records for a relative.

34:03.499 --> 34:04.834
Yes, a cousin.

34:04.917 --> 34:09.047
We think he may have been here
about 30 years ago.

34:09.130 --> 34:12.091
I'm wondering
if you happen to have any files

34:12.175 --> 34:14.302
or photo albums
I might be able to look at.

34:14.385 --> 34:15.636
-Of course.
-Oh, good.

34:15.720 --> 34:17.388
-Right over here.
-Thank you.

34:30.693 --> 34:33.905
That can't be real. Get on over here.

34:33.988 --> 34:37.533
Oh, God damn! Let me look at you.

34:38.826 --> 34:39.869
Uncle Cade!

34:39.952 --> 34:44.040
Now there's a grown-up Langmore man
if I ever seen one.

34:44.123 --> 34:48.127
You. You were just a little tadpole
last time I seen you.

34:48.753 --> 34:49.837
Welcome home, Uncle Cade.

34:49.921 --> 34:54.425
Yeah, I'm sorry your dad and uncle
aren't here for us all to be together,

34:54.509 --> 34:59.555
but I promise, on my honor,
I'm gonna do right by you in their memory.

35:00.473 --> 35:03.684
Ah. I can't believe how big you both are.

35:05.478 --> 35:06.479
Daddy.

35:08.189 --> 35:09.398
You're staying over there.

35:13.611 --> 35:15.279
I thought you'd want your privacy.

35:32.672 --> 35:33.881
Get over here.

35:38.970 --> 35:41.305
This about the nicest thing I ever seen.

35:48.146 --> 35:49.188
Hello.

35:49.272 --> 35:50.398
[Wendy] Hi. I'm here!

35:51.190 --> 35:55.444
[Marty] Well, what's the emergency?
I told Ruth that I would talk to her.

35:55.528 --> 35:58.030
And I can't keep putting it off.
It's too important.

36:00.116 --> 36:04.871
What's that, a tux?
I thought our anniversary is in August.

36:04.954 --> 36:08.791
Charles Wilkes is throwing a benefit
for his charity tonight in Kansas City.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.294
I bought a table.

36:13.337 --> 36:14.505
You bought a table?

36:15.214 --> 36:16.716
For $50,000.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.677
$50,000?

36:19.760 --> 36:23.389
Wendy, you realize he sent someone
to explicitly tell us to stay away.

36:23.472 --> 36:26.392
-No, he didn't.
-He didn't?

36:26.684 --> 36:28.978
Okay. You know,

36:29.061 --> 36:32.023
the second you get back around politics,
you get this look.

36:32.106 --> 36:33.316
You know that, right?

36:33.399 --> 36:35.818
No one drives four hours
to tell someone to stay away.

36:35.902 --> 36:38.321
It's like calling someone and saying
you never want to speak to them again.

36:38.446 --> 36:39.405
[Marty] Mm-hmm.

36:40.072 --> 36:41.199
It wasn't a warning,

36:42.533 --> 36:43.910
it was an invitation.

36:43.993 --> 36:44.911
Got it.

36:46.078 --> 36:48.164
[music playing on radio]

36:49.040 --> 36:52.585
[Cade] Any of you boys are known felons,
you might want to skedaddle.

36:52.668 --> 36:54.754
I ain't supposed to be consortin'
with you.

36:54.837 --> 36:56.255
[all chuckle]

37:00.509 --> 37:03.596
-Sorry. Meant to get to you this morning.
-[Ruth] It's okay.

37:03.679 --> 37:05.932
-My dad just came home.
-[Marty] Sure.

37:06.015 --> 37:07.683
[Ruth] So, been busy.

37:07.767 --> 37:08.601
[Marty] Yeah.

37:10.102 --> 37:12.730
You didn't bring me a corsage
or some shit, did you?

37:12.813 --> 37:13.731
Fuck no, we got a thing.

37:13.814 --> 37:16.567
-You must be Martin Byrde.
-Hi. You're Cade?

37:16.651 --> 37:17.902
-Yes, I am.
-Hi, there.

37:17.985 --> 37:20.196
Hi. I wanted to say thank you very much

37:20.279 --> 37:22.281
for taking care of my baby girl
while I was away.

37:23.157 --> 37:25.076
Yeah. Well, you know, she's...

37:25.826 --> 37:26.661
Um...

37:27.662 --> 37:28.621
Congratulations.

37:29.956 --> 37:30.998
For what?

37:32.792 --> 37:35.002
-Well, you know, she--
-I'm just kidding.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.420
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

37:37.421 --> 37:39.590
-It's good to be free.
-I'll bet.

37:39.674 --> 37:40.758
Hmm.

37:41.342 --> 37:43.010
Anyway, you look like a man
with things to do.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.387
I'll let you two talk, and...

37:44.470 --> 37:46.389
-Got a thing.
-Yeah, you have a good night.

37:47.640 --> 37:48.516
Pleasure.

37:48.599 --> 37:49.433
[Cade] Mm-hmm.

37:52.061 --> 37:53.271
Um...

37:53.354 --> 37:57.024
So, listen. We're not partners, okay?

37:57.108 --> 37:59.235
I won't be held hostage
because of what you did for me.

37:59.318 --> 38:00.319
You understand?

38:01.279 --> 38:02.113
Okay.

38:02.196 --> 38:04.615
So, besides that, tell me what you want.

38:05.950 --> 38:06.867
A raise.

38:08.286 --> 38:09.120
How much?

38:11.789 --> 38:13.374
Twenty-five grand a year.

38:15.751 --> 38:18.045
Okay. Done. Anything else?

38:20.298 --> 38:22.174
I wanna learn how to use the books.

38:24.176 --> 38:26.595
Sure. What else?

38:31.767 --> 38:32.685
That's it.

in Australia.

40:48.237 --> 40:49.780
-I'm very impressed.
-[both chuckle]

40:50.656 --> 40:53.576
Do you know the names of everybody
who donated here? Oh.

40:53.659 --> 40:55.703
Knowing people's names
seems the bare minimum

-I should introduce you to my husband.
-I'd love to meet him.

41:21.353 --> 41:23.939
Hi. I was hoping you could help me.

41:24.023 --> 41:26.567
A client of mine
swiped his credit card here recently,

41:26.650 --> 41:29.028
and I'd love to take a look
at your security footage.

41:29.111 --> 41:31.071
I can give you precise date and time.

41:31.697 --> 41:32.781
I can't do that.

41:32.865 --> 41:35.451
His card was actually used
without his knowledge.

41:35.910 --> 41:37.036

41:37.912 --> 41:39.455
I'm his attorney.

We're trying to conduct this investigation
as discreetly as possible.

41:44.126 --> 41:45.878
I'm sure you understand.

41:47.046 --> 41:50.174
What part of "I can't do that"
is so fucking confusing?

41:56.055 --> 41:58.098
Are all the files kept in that recorder?

41:59.016 --> 41:59.850
Why?

42:00.184 --> 42:03.187
I'm just curious
if they're sent to another server

42:03.270 --> 42:04.855
or if you're my only recourse.

42:04.939 --> 42:06.023
[clears throat]

42:06.106 --> 42:08.234
No. You are stuck with me.

to pay for any inconvenience.

I'm sorry we couldn't come
to an agreement.

I already said everything I had to say.

No, no, no, no, no. No, no.

How about now?

Tell me. How does a casino equate
to a more simple family life?

43:49.918 --> 43:55.257
What we do for a living has
absolutely no bearing on how we parent.

43:55.341 --> 43:56.717
And I refute anybody

43:56.800 --> 43:59.762
who says Christian values
and capitalism can't coexist.

[Wendy] Hmm?

44:05.434 --> 44:06.852
We are new to Missouri,

44:06.935 --> 44:10.898
but we understand business,
and we understand the power of community.

44:13.233 --> 44:15.444
You said you worked in politics
in Chicago?

44:16.153 --> 44:16.987
I did.

44:17.613 --> 44:19.490
[Wilkes] And you think
you can sell me on this idea.

44:19.573 --> 44:21.450
-I do.
-[Wilkes] Yeah?

44:24.078 --> 44:25.329
Enlighten me.

44:28.415 --> 44:33.796

skimmed the surface...

in the US, okay?

45:07.621 --> 45:09.206
Let's go. Out of the car.

Out of the car.

In the back seat.

45:29.143 --> 45:29.977
You lied.

45:33.522 --> 45:36.608
This is Del's credit card being used
in Chicago.

45:37.818 --> 45:41.488
I'm sure you can recognize that gentleman.
He's rather distinctive.

Distinctively not Del.

-[Helen] Oh, please.

45:54.960 --> 45:56.295
For both our sakes.

45:57.129 --> 45:59.006
We know you are not a killer.

46:00.340 --> 46:01.800
You're a businessman,

46:02.801 --> 46:07.639
which is why we are giving you an hour
to negotiate reparations for Del's death.

46:09.099 --> 46:11.018
-One hour?
-Mm-hmm.

46:12.019 --> 46:14.813
After that, I have to leave it
to my associates outside.

46:17.566 --> 46:19.234
[Marty] Uh, well...

46:23.197 --> 46:25.282
Del was completely out of line.

46:25.365 --> 46:29.453
We had a deal made
and then he started insulting the Snells.

46:29.536 --> 46:32.247
I don't doubt it. I knew Del.

46:33.373 --> 46:34.625
Nevertheless.

46:39.171 --> 46:40.964
What kind of deal
are you willing to accept?

46:42.424 --> 46:44.343
I'll know it when I hear it.

46:46.762 --> 46:47.763
Okay.

46:49.890 --> 46:50.849
Okay.

46:51.809 --> 46:53.227
Let's go see the Snells.

46:54.895 --> 46:55.729
Good.

46:56.313 --> 46:57.606
[all laughing]

46:58.857 --> 47:00.359
[Wyatt] So were you ever scared in there?

47:01.485 --> 47:04.988
[Cade] Most of those boys don't really
fight, they just push and shove.

47:07.783 --> 47:08.992
But forget about me.

47:09.993 --> 47:12.913
Tell me about you, boy.
How's that local talent?

47:13.997 --> 47:17.125
-What are you talking about?
-Girls. Lakeside.

47:18.585 --> 47:20.212
You managing to get your share?

47:20.295 --> 47:22.548
[Wyatt] They don't pay
much attention to me.

47:22.631 --> 47:26.176
None of 'em? There must be at least one
with some sense.

47:26.635 --> 47:29.054
I don't know. Maybe one.

47:30.097 --> 47:31.431
[laughing]

47:32.891 --> 47:34.226
[Cade] Do tell.

47:34.643 --> 47:36.186
[Ruth] You need to go to sleep.

47:36.812 --> 47:38.230
It's a fucking school night.

47:38.814 --> 47:39.773
[Cade] Tell you what.

47:40.607 --> 47:44.069
We'll do a little business together,
put some money in your pocket,

47:44.611 --> 47:46.113
let the girls notice...

47:46.780 --> 47:48.073
that bulge.

47:48.156 --> 47:50.742
[both laughing]

47:51.827 --> 47:53.704
-[Ruth] Classy.
-[chuckling] Oh! Whoa!

47:54.997 --> 47:56.832
[Ruth] You're not supposed
to drink on parole.

47:56.915 --> 47:59.585
Hmm. Girl thinks
she's both our mamas.

48:04.882 --> 48:05.716
So...

48:06.925 --> 48:09.303
what do you think happened
to your daddy, anyway?

48:09.386 --> 48:13.015
How's he careless enough to go
and get himself electrocuted?

48:13.098 --> 48:14.641
That's not like him.

48:17.060 --> 48:19.104
Yeah. I don't know.

48:19.897 --> 48:21.773
Probably Boyd did something stupid.

48:21.857 --> 48:22.983
[Cade] Yeah.

48:23.650 --> 48:24.568
Mm-hmm.

48:25.110 --> 48:26.653
Maybe it was Boyd.

48:30.407 --> 48:34.870
Fuck it. I'm going to bed.
Don't blame me if your mornings are shit.

48:38.123 --> 48:40.000
-[Wyatt] Night!
-Night.

48:41.335 --> 48:42.961
[Jacob] <i>What are they asking for?</i>

48:44.046 --> 48:45.339
Fair reparations.

48:46.048 --> 48:47.966
The man violated a code.

48:49.384 --> 48:52.012
The man was a top lieutenant
in a billion dollar business.

48:54.306 --> 48:55.474
Thank you, Ash.

49:00.896 --> 49:02.439
What are you suggesting?

49:03.607 --> 49:05.567
You should offer them $5 million.

49:06.985 --> 49:10.280
-For that Mexican man?
-[Wendy] Del had a wife and two children.

49:10.364 --> 49:11.406
They're better off without him.

49:12.741 --> 49:14.451
[Marty] We can't leave here
without a solution.

49:15.035 --> 49:17.496
[Darlene] There's nothing needs solving.

49:17.579 --> 49:20.832
I take it they didn't give you
clear guidelines.

49:23.919 --> 49:24.920
What about $4 million?

49:30.175 --> 49:33.303
[Wendy] What if you adjusted
your percentage in the casino?

49:33.971 --> 49:36.598
Nothing comes out of your pocket
until it makes money.

49:41.019 --> 49:45.899
5%? 3%. That'd pay for
any misunderstanding in perpetuity.

49:45.983 --> 49:47.150
[Darlene] It's weakness.

49:47.234 --> 49:48.068
[Wendy] Your heroin.

49:49.152 --> 49:52.114
Maybe you surrender profits
on a certain number of shipments.

49:52.197 --> 49:55.033
They'd still need to provide distribution.

49:55.117 --> 49:56.535
[Marty] We could negotiate that.

49:56.618 --> 50:00.580
[Darlene] Giving away our crop for free
goes against the backbone of this deal.

50:00.664 --> 50:02.332
You shot their man's fucking head off.

50:03.041 --> 50:06.336
[Jacob] The man violated a code.
That has a price...

50:07.713 --> 50:09.464
but it's not ours to pay.

50:17.472 --> 50:19.141
Jacob, there are Mexicans at your gate

50:19.224 --> 50:22.227
that are ready to come up here
and wipe us all out.

50:22.310 --> 50:23.854
[Darlene] Let 'em come.

50:25.814 --> 50:27.774
[Wendy] You have got
to think this through.

50:29.609 --> 50:33.405
The cartel has more men and more guns
than you could ever have,

50:33.488 --> 50:37.117
and if it doesn't happen tonight,
they'll just send more men.

50:37.200 --> 50:40.620
More and more and more.
So, I'm begging you.

50:42.831 --> 50:44.583
We are begging you. We have two children.

50:44.666 --> 50:49.296
So, I ask you, just see this through.
Just think it through.

50:50.839 --> 50:52.049
You need to go.

50:53.842 --> 50:54.718
Go.

51:00.348 --> 51:01.683
Don't do this.

51:01.767 --> 51:04.770
[Jacob] No more compromises,
no more deals.

51:05.645 --> 51:09.191
Ash, escort them out. Get the men.

51:12.903 --> 51:15.030
-[grunts]
-[Wendy yells] Oh!

51:22.079 --> 51:24.122
-[Wendy gasping] Oh, God.
-[Marty] Jesus Christ.

51:24.206 --> 51:25.207
[Darlene] No!

51:26.208 --> 51:28.919
Jacob! No! No!

51:29.002 --> 51:31.046
[gasps] Ash! Ash!

51:31.129 --> 51:33.715
[breathing heavily]

51:33.799 --> 51:35.425
[Marty] Jesus Christ, Jacob.

51:36.635 --> 51:37.636
What the fuck?

51:38.220 --> 51:39.304
Why, Jacob?

51:40.055 --> 51:41.098
No. Ash.

51:41.181 --> 51:43.058
You killed their man, Darlene.

51:43.141 --> 51:46.144
-[Darlene whimpering] Shit.
-Go on.

51:46.269 --> 51:48.688
This was the only thing
that was gonna make it right.

51:48.772 --> 51:49.981
And you know it.

51:52.776 --> 51:54.486
Now, go get your Mexican.

51:55.278 --> 51:56.363
[Darlene sighs]

51:57.989 --> 52:00.075
[Marty] Come on. Yeah.

52:05.122 --> 52:06.748
[Wendy] Excuse me. I'm sorry.

52:48.665 --> 52:50.083
Is that what we wanted?

52:55.505 --> 52:57.299
We didn't want anything.

53:02.345 --> 53:03.430
[Wendy] So, that's it?

53:05.182 --> 53:08.268
We go back in that house, go to bed,
wake up in the morning, kiss the kids?

53:11.855 --> 53:13.773
That's exactly what we do.

53:14.608 --> 53:18.236
We make the pancakes, and ask the kids
what's going on with school

53:18.320 --> 53:21.698
and we just keep trying to figure out
a way out of this, Wendy.

53:21.781 --> 53:23.033
We're responsible.

53:24.284 --> 53:25.785
-What for?
-All of it.

53:25.869 --> 53:26.703
No, we're not.

53:26.786 --> 53:29.539
-Another man is dead.
-Because of his choices.

53:29.623 --> 53:32.751
He didn't have to try
to cover up a murder, okay?

53:32.834 --> 53:35.837
Just like Darlene didn't have to
kill Del in the first place,

53:35.921 --> 53:39.674
or Russ and Boyd didn't have to decide
to try to kill me,

53:39.758 --> 53:42.886
or Mason should have stayed out
on the water.

53:42.969 --> 53:45.180
Should've stayed on the fucking water.

53:45.722 --> 53:47.432
And, you know...

53:48.683 --> 53:51.519
People make choices, Wendy.
Choices have consequences.

53:51.603 --> 53:54.064
We don't have to live
under the weight of those decisions.

53:55.690 --> 53:57.734
At least admit it was good for us.

54:01.071 --> 54:03.740
If that man hadn't died,
the casino would be dead.

54:04.908 --> 54:06.076
So would we.

54:10.247 --> 54:11.373
We got lucky.

54:56.251 --> 54:57.460
What'd he want?

55:01.756 --> 55:04.509
-Who?
-Byrde.

55:05.593 --> 55:07.470
Why'd he show up here like that?

55:10.265 --> 55:12.142
I asked him for a raise.

55:19.774 --> 55:21.776
[Cade sighs]

55:29.659 --> 55:30.952
[grunts]

55:32.579 --> 55:35.123
[breathing heavily]

55:36.374 --> 55:37.625
What'd he say?

55:47.093 --> 55:48.553
He said yes.

55:49.471 --> 55:50.388
[Cade sighs]

55:52.974 --> 55:57.145
You just remember, he ain't your daddy.
