WEBVTT

00:02.500 --> 00:03.834
Okay, I'm off to work.

00:03.917 --> 00:05.375
I keep thinking
that'll stop sounding weird

00:05.458 --> 00:07.333
coming out of your mouth,
and I keep being wrong.

00:07.417 --> 00:10.041
Get used to it,
because I love doing deliveries

00:10.125 --> 00:12.417
for Sub Hub --
cruising around town,

00:12.500 --> 00:14.500
cranking tunes,
high as a kite,

00:14.583 --> 00:16.458
skimming ham off
the double-meat orders.

00:16.542 --> 00:19.709
Wait. Hayley, when did you
stop being a vegetarian?

00:19.792 --> 00:22.166
When I started getting high
driving meat around town.

00:22.250 --> 00:24.959
Sub Hub has
the shiniest ham.

00:25.041 --> 00:26.709
And you...want that?

00:26.792 --> 00:28.000
Oh, yeah.

00:28.083 --> 00:30.041
The shine is the ham
working up a sweat

00:30.125 --> 00:31.542
to give you
maximum flavor.

00:31.625 --> 00:33.959
The wetter,
the better, baby!

00:34.041 --> 00:35.083
Really, Klaus?

00:35.166 --> 00:36.792
This is something
you know about?

00:36.875 --> 00:39.333
Actually, no,
but when you show enthusiasm,

00:39.417 --> 00:40.792
you get to be
a part of things.

00:40.875 --> 00:42.333
The job's perfect.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.875
The only thing I don't love
is the uniform.

00:44.959 --> 00:48.000
The hat covers my headband,
the shirt covers my belly ring.

00:48.083 --> 00:50.125
I look like some
Wall Street fat cat.

00:50.208 --> 00:52.000
I'm gonna ask if I can wear
regular clothes to work.

00:52.083 --> 00:54.000
That's not how work works.

00:54.083 --> 00:56.750
You think I want to wear
this suit to the office? No!

00:56.834 --> 00:59.166
I'd rather wear
jeans and my Pistons jersey.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.500
What in the hell are
you two doing?

01:07.583 --> 01:09.000
We're doing things
backwards.

01:09.083 --> 01:10.875
Getting pumped to watch
"Breaking Bad"

01:10.959 --> 01:12.959
in reverse order
from finale to premiere.

01:13.041 --> 01:14.291
It's gonna be
the shit.

01:14.375 --> 01:15.667
I didn't watch it
when it aired

01:15.750 --> 01:17.333
because I don't like
dark stories.

01:17.417 --> 01:19.834
But backwards,
it's about a drug kingpin

01:19.917 --> 01:21.083
who gives it all up
to be a teacher

01:21.166 --> 01:22.583
who doesn't have
cancer.

01:22.667 --> 01:25.208
That does sound
like it's gonna be the shit.

01:25.291 --> 01:26.250
Count me in!

01:26.333 --> 01:27.417
Well, I hope there's room

01:27.500 --> 01:28.959
on the couch for one more.

01:29.041 --> 01:30.417
Because word on the street

01:30.500 --> 01:33.333
is that this backwards
"Breaking Bad" party

01:33.417 --> 01:37.417
is gonna be the!

01:37.500 --> 01:39.000
Hey, what's with the bleep?!

01:39.083 --> 01:41.291
He said it and she said it,
but I can't?

01:41.375 --> 01:42.792
I'll give you something
to bleep!

01:42.875 --> 01:45.417
you,
you mother.

01:45.500 --> 01:47.709
You can suck my fat...

01:47.792 --> 01:49.208
fishy...

01:49.291 --> 01:52.625
wiener!!

01:52.709 --> 01:54.792
Oh. You can say "wiener"?

01:54.875 --> 01:57.166
Guys! We can say "wiener"!

02:00.000 --> 02:02.417

02:02.500 --> 02:06.250

02:29.792 --> 02:32.500
Hey, Dad. Uh...
here's your sandwich

02:32.583 --> 02:35.125
with exactly as much extra ham
as it's supposed to have.

02:35.208 --> 02:37.792
Let's see if
it's as shiny as you say.

02:37.875 --> 02:38.917
Yow!

02:39.000 --> 02:40.625
If it's as wet as
it is shiny,

02:40.709 --> 02:42.291
then we've got
something here.

02:43.709 --> 02:45.250
Mm-hmm.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.291
Mm-hmm.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.125
Mm-hmm.

02:49.208 --> 02:51.083
Mm-hmm.

02:51.166 --> 02:52.750
Mm-hmm.

02:52.834 --> 02:55.375
Very nice.

02:55.458 --> 02:56.375
Phew.

02:56.458 --> 02:57.417
You got my turkey club?

02:57.500 --> 02:58.875
Whoa!
Are you okay?

02:58.959 --> 03:01.375
There's no A/C on my side
of the office.

03:01.458 --> 03:03.500
It wouldn't be so bad
if I didn't always carry

03:03.583 --> 03:05.375
loose Hershey Kisses
in my pocket.

03:05.458 --> 03:07.625
Chopsticks!
Chopsticks!

03:07.709 --> 03:09.709
That's right, you got
the Chinese chicken sal--

03:11.000 --> 03:13.125
Oh! Did you get shot?!

03:18.041 --> 03:19.208
You need to go
to the hospital.

03:19.291 --> 03:20.917
I wish!

03:21.000 --> 03:24.917
CIA health insurance only covers
visits to the "hopsital."

03:25.000 --> 03:27.625
That's a hospital for
bunny rabbits.

03:27.709 --> 03:28.625
Geez!

03:28.709 --> 03:31.125
Wolverine!

03:31.208 --> 03:32.500
What the hell
was that?!

03:32.583 --> 03:34.375
That's the wolverine
that escaped from the lab.

03:34.458 --> 03:36.000
We can't figure out how
to get rid of him.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.625
Maybe if you threw less meat
on the walls?

03:37.709 --> 03:39.583
It's a genetically augmented
wolverine

03:39.667 --> 03:41.959
that only likes people meat,
Miss Know It All!

03:42.041 --> 03:43.291
That's even worse!

03:43.375 --> 03:44.500
You guys need
to talk to Bullock

03:44.583 --> 03:45.709
about your working
conditions.

03:45.792 --> 03:47.625
They're terrible.
Millennials.

03:47.709 --> 03:49.417
You think the world should
bend to you,

03:49.500 --> 03:51.333
but if you can't deal
with a broken air conditioner

03:51.417 --> 03:53.083
or a wolverine picking off
your coworkers

03:53.166 --> 03:54.834
one by one,
you're never gonna make it!

03:54.917 --> 03:57.625
Fine. I won't talk
about how dumb your office is.

03:57.709 --> 03:59.000
Great. Now, Hayley,

03:59.083 --> 04:00.875
I'm still thrilled
to eat the sandwich.

04:00.959 --> 04:03.792
But can you tell me a little bit
about why this is happening?

04:14.083 --> 04:15.625
Oh, my God!
What?!

04:15.709 --> 04:17.250
That was the finale?

04:17.333 --> 04:20.750
So many people dead.
"Breaking Bad" is depressing!

04:20.834 --> 04:24.000
For the saps who watch the show
in regular order!

04:24.083 --> 04:26.208
Yep,
for us "reversos" --

04:26.291 --> 04:28.125
and Christian Scientists,
I think --

04:28.208 --> 04:30.375
death is but the beginning
of the story.

04:30.458 --> 04:33.083
These characters
are so layered.

04:33.166 --> 04:35.333
It'll be fun watching them
become less developed

04:35.417 --> 04:36.667
in earlier episodes.

04:36.750 --> 04:38.125
And less dead!

04:38.208 --> 04:41.041
Oh, man!
I am so excited!

04:41.125 --> 04:43.417
This is gonna be
so awesome!

04:43.500 --> 04:45.417
Dial back
the enthusiasm, Klaus.

04:45.500 --> 04:47.041
We've already
included you.

04:49.667 --> 04:51.792
Meatball sub for Avery.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.208
Well, if it isn't
my former conquest...

04:54.291 --> 04:56.500
slipping me the meat
for once.

04:56.583 --> 04:58.500
That's actually the only way
we ever did it.

04:58.583 --> 04:59.709
Anyway,
here's your sandwic--

04:59.792 --> 05:01.500
Ow! Wha--

05:01.583 --> 05:03.291
Why do you have
an electric fence?!

05:03.375 --> 05:05.041
To keep the wolverine
at bay.

05:06.709 --> 05:08.834
It's freezing in here.

05:08.917 --> 05:13.750
Oh, yes. That's conditioned air
from my private unit.

05:13.834 --> 05:17.041
I've bested you again,
you cretinous ball of gas.

05:17.125 --> 05:21.917
Go ahead, try to burn my eyes!
Do your worst!

05:22.000 --> 05:24.250
What massage would you like
today, sir?

05:24.333 --> 05:26.208
Thai? Swedish?
Russian?

05:26.291 --> 05:28.083
Why not all at once?

05:28.166 --> 05:32.625
Everything's covered
by my executive insurance.

05:32.709 --> 05:34.333
Ahhhhhhh!

05:34.417 --> 05:37.166
You know, while you're in here
living in luxury,

05:37.250 --> 05:40.834
your employees have started a
wait-list to use the paperclip.

05:40.917 --> 05:42.542
Just throw them a bone.

05:42.625 --> 05:44.250
Fix that loose tile
in the kitchen

05:44.333 --> 05:45.542
that people keep
tripping over.

05:45.625 --> 05:47.834
Hmm. I suppose
that's reasonable.

05:47.917 --> 05:50.083
The tile shall be fixed.

05:50.166 --> 05:53.083
Now, if you'll excuse us,
these lovely ladies are

05:53.166 --> 05:56.917
going to massacre my penis
with a Wiffle Ball bat.

06:01.208 --> 06:04.041
So, that's how
"Breaking Bad" started.

06:04.125 --> 06:06.208
It's a bit
anticlimactic.

06:06.291 --> 06:08.542
We're just supposed to buy
that he's a teacher?

06:08.625 --> 06:10.834
We don't even see how he got
his teaching credentials?

06:10.917 --> 06:13.041
Maybe we didn't
do the reverso right.

06:13.125 --> 06:15.750
What do you mean?
We watched the series backwards.

06:15.834 --> 06:19.000
But we watched each episode
forwards.

06:19.083 --> 06:22.333
What if we do this...

06:22.417 --> 06:24.667
Mom, this is a complete
waste of --
Hi, this is Vince Gilligan,

06:24.750 --> 06:27.000
creator of "Breaking Bad,"
and if you're hearing this,

06:27.083 --> 06:29.291
that means you're watching
my show backwards --

06:29.375 --> 06:31.417
the right way.
See?

06:31.500 --> 06:33.709
"Breaking Bad" was never meant
to be a highly acclaimed

06:33.792 --> 06:35.750
tautly paced television show.

06:35.834 --> 06:37.041
It's a treasure map.

06:37.125 --> 06:38.250
I told you!

06:38.333 --> 06:40.000
Shh! It's talking.

06:40.083 --> 06:43.333
I have buried treasure all over
these United States.

06:43.417 --> 06:48.125
Are you reversos bad enough
to break my clues?

06:48.208 --> 06:49.667
The first clue is...

06:49.750 --> 06:51.291
drive to Albuquerque.

06:51.375 --> 06:52.583
Okay, Albuquerque...

06:52.667 --> 06:54.542
Albuquerque --
that sounds like a word.

06:54.625 --> 06:56.291
Wait. Is that one
of my personas?

06:56.375 --> 06:57.875
No, no --
That's Albert Gerky,

06:58.000 --> 07:00.792
second-generation
peepshow splooge-mopper.

07:00.875 --> 07:03.000
"Drive to Albuquerque."

07:03.083 --> 07:05.375
Maybe it has no meaning.

07:05.458 --> 07:08.083
Roger, are you coming?!
We're driving to Albuquerque!

07:08.166 --> 07:09.542
I cracked it!

07:12.083 --> 07:14.250
Lunch is here.
Nothing for me, thanks.

07:14.333 --> 07:17.250
I've got a seafood tower
waiting for me in my office.

07:17.333 --> 07:20.917
And before you start in on me
about working conditions,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.041
I fixed that loose tile
in the kitchen.

07:23.125 --> 07:25.792
Speaking of the kitchen,
anybody want a drink from there?

07:25.875 --> 07:27.500
I'm good.
I got the wet ham.

07:27.583 --> 07:29.458
It washes itself down.

07:30.834 --> 07:32.917
Suit yourself.
More Fanta for...

07:33.000 --> 07:34.375
meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

07:35.500 --> 07:37.041
Where's the floor?

07:37.125 --> 07:39.208
Turns out all the tiles
were connected,

07:39.291 --> 07:41.125
so I had to remove
the entire floor.

07:41.208 --> 07:42.792
Do you like the hole?

07:42.875 --> 07:44.875
It's for you,
the people.

07:44.959 --> 07:46.458
That's it.

07:48.458 --> 07:51.083
CIA workers,
you have endured unsafe,

07:51.166 --> 07:53.709
unfair working conditions
for far too long.

07:53.792 --> 07:57.166
It is time to pull together
and go on strike!

07:57.250 --> 07:59.083
- I never thought of that.
- Whoa, whoa!

07:59.166 --> 08:01.667
You're just gonna turn your back
on this great agency --

08:01.750 --> 08:04.542
one that's provided you
with so much for so long?

08:04.625 --> 08:06.625
I mean, we were
just given a hole.

08:06.709 --> 08:07.917
How's the hole, Jackson?

08:08.000 --> 08:10.083
It's freakin' deep, man!

08:10.166 --> 08:11.834
I rest my case.

08:12.959 --> 08:16.041
You all need to ask yourselves
one question --

08:16.125 --> 08:18.458
"Do I deserve more?"

08:18.542 --> 08:19.917
♪♪

08:20.000 --> 08:22.959
Come on!
You deserve more?

08:23.041 --> 08:26.041
10-foot-tall desks
aren't enough?

08:29.750 --> 08:32.000
Fine!
Have your silly strike.

08:32.083 --> 08:33.291
But the joke's on you.

08:33.375 --> 08:34.667
With the wolverine
running around,

08:34.750 --> 08:36.375
this is the safest spot
in the office.

08:40.208 --> 08:42.750
I see you found
the ceiling tunnels.

08:42.834 --> 08:45.542
I suppose it was only
a matter of time.

08:55.458 --> 08:59.000
All right, who's ready to fight
for what they deserve?!

09:00.500 --> 09:03.417
Do we get to chant stuff
when we march?

09:03.500 --> 09:05.917
That always looks so fun.
Of course.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.875
The best strike chants
summarize your demands

09:07.959 --> 09:09.041
in a short, witty rhyme.

09:09.125 --> 09:10.458
Does anyone know a word

09:10.542 --> 09:13.000
that rhymes
with "unlimited colonoscopies"?

09:13.083 --> 09:15.041
I'm back from
the balloon store.
Great.

09:15.125 --> 09:16.875
Nothing draws attention
to a picket line

09:16.959 --> 09:19.417
like a classic
giant inflatable strike rat

09:19.500 --> 09:21.959
to symbolize a greedy,
sneaky company.

09:27.208 --> 09:29.208
Sorry. I thought
you said "giraffe."

09:29.291 --> 09:30.792
You thought that, Dick?

09:30.875 --> 09:32.583
I really like
giraffes.

09:32.667 --> 09:33.625
Okay.

09:33.709 --> 09:35.125
We can make this work.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.000
Let's just get
the picket line going.

09:37.083 --> 09:38.333
What do we want?!

09:38.417 --> 09:40.375
-Air conditioning!
-Floors!

09:40.458 --> 09:42.333
Unlimited
colonoscopies!

09:42.417 --> 09:43.583
When do we want it?!

09:43.667 --> 09:45.834
Good question!
We never discussed that!

09:45.917 --> 09:47.875
I'm crapping blood now!

09:49.083 --> 09:50.166
Move it, socialists!

09:50.250 --> 09:51.750
Capitalism coming through!

09:51.834 --> 09:53.542
-Scab!
-Traitor!

09:53.625 --> 09:56.417
Does anyone have a hoodie
I can wrap around my waist?!

10:00.750 --> 10:01.917
No!

10:02.000 --> 10:05.333
I was gonna use that
in my pool!

10:05.417 --> 10:08.667
An African warlord has captured
an American journalist?

10:08.750 --> 10:09.709
Wait, wait. Hold on.

10:09.792 --> 10:11.125
Okay, now, what color exactly

10:11.208 --> 10:12.917
is this suspicious powder?
Hang up, Smith.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.959
I've got an important assignment
for you.

10:15.041 --> 10:16.250
What is it, sir?

10:16.333 --> 10:18.208
Those strikers are
testing our resolve,

10:18.291 --> 10:20.792
so we need to dig in
and wait them out...

10:20.875 --> 10:23.041
by playing "Home Alone"!

10:23.125 --> 10:24.333
You'll be the bandits.

10:24.417 --> 10:26.333
I, of course,
will play Kevin McCallister.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.959
Everyone says I look
just like him.

10:29.041 --> 10:30.500
I don't have time, sir.

10:30.583 --> 10:32.750
I need to keep the office
running all by myself.

10:32.834 --> 10:36.041
And I...must protect
this house!

10:58.333 --> 11:01.792
Keep the change,
ya filthy animal.

11:01.875 --> 11:03.250
Smith?!

11:03.333 --> 11:05.083
I'm sleepy.

11:05.166 --> 11:08.500
Call in the strikers.
It's time to negotiate.

11:08.583 --> 11:09.959
Sir, I don't want
my daughter

11:10.041 --> 11:11.583
to think this is how
the world works --

11:11.667 --> 11:13.375
you complain
and you get your way.

11:13.458 --> 11:15.500
Well, we can go back
to "Home Alone," if you like.

11:15.583 --> 11:19.792
The next prank involves
a hot iron and 17 rusty nails.

11:19.875 --> 11:22.500
I'll call in
the strikers.

11:22.583 --> 11:23.750
Ow!

11:31.291 --> 11:32.709
We're gonna die!

11:32.792 --> 11:34.667
The boy makes
a good point, Francine.

11:34.750 --> 11:37.083
Vince Gilligan's clue said
to go to Albuquerque,

11:37.166 --> 11:39.208
but it didn't say
to drive 90 miles an hour

11:39.291 --> 11:40.500
backwards on the highway!

11:40.583 --> 11:42.583
I'm doing it reverso!

11:42.667 --> 11:46.375
Remember, I'm the one
who found the first clue!

11:46.458 --> 11:49.291
No one in this car knows
the mind of Vince Gillibrand

11:49.375 --> 11:50.959
better than me!

11:51.041 --> 11:53.834
Great! Now we're
going to jail!

11:53.875 --> 11:56.417
Steve, hold my weed.

12:02.959 --> 12:05.125
Francine, I have
an unregistered gun

12:05.208 --> 12:06.208
in the glove box.

12:06.291 --> 12:07.709
Say the word "officer"

12:07.792 --> 12:09.750
if you want me to shoot our way
out of this.

12:13.125 --> 12:15.375
What's up, reversos?!

12:15.458 --> 12:18.542
Looks like you just earned
your next clue!

12:18.625 --> 12:20.291
Welcome to Albuquerque.

12:20.375 --> 12:22.166
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!

12:24.792 --> 12:28.083
Let's get ready
to negotiate!

12:28.166 --> 12:32.667
Smith will go first,
representing management.

12:32.750 --> 12:37.125
Come back to work now,
and our revenge will be minimal.

12:37.208 --> 12:38.583
Short and sweet.

12:38.667 --> 12:39.875
Sandwich girl?

12:39.959 --> 12:41.208
Well...

12:41.291 --> 12:44.041
I've never really
done this before.

12:44.125 --> 12:45.542
Let's do
the streamlined version.

12:45.625 --> 12:48.458
Drop slides
6, 11, and 13.

12:50.333 --> 12:53.500
Since the dawn of time,

12:53.583 --> 12:56.250
there have been workers...

12:56.333 --> 12:59.166
and those who manage them.

13:19.250 --> 13:22.834
And that's why the entire
concept of America

13:22.917 --> 13:26.375
doesn't work without workers.

13:27.458 --> 13:29.625
Oh, snap!

13:29.709 --> 13:31.583
She destroyed you, Smith.

13:31.667 --> 13:34.041
Young lady, that is
the most brilliant negotiating

13:34.125 --> 13:36.125
I've ever seen.
That's not even
negotiating!

13:36.208 --> 13:40.000
I declare the strike over
and accept all their demands.

13:40.083 --> 13:42.166
Now, let's get everybody
back to work.

13:42.250 --> 13:43.750
I should
get going, too.

13:43.834 --> 13:45.667
I have a trunk full
of tuna sandwiches to deliver --

13:45.750 --> 13:46.959
from yesterday.

13:47.041 --> 13:49.333
Forget sandwiches,
sandwich girl.

13:49.417 --> 13:51.750
I'm so impressed
that I'd like to hire you

13:51.834 --> 13:54.250
as a CIA negotiator.
Really?

13:54.333 --> 13:57.041
An African warlord has kidnapped
an American journalist,

13:57.125 --> 13:58.875
and you're going
to get her back for us.

13:58.959 --> 14:00.458
Oh, no, no!

14:00.542 --> 14:02.500
She led a strike!
You can't reward her for that!

14:02.583 --> 14:04.041
Ah, Smith --

14:04.125 --> 14:05.875
the only man
who stood by me

14:05.959 --> 14:07.792
when everyone else
walked out.

14:07.875 --> 14:09.667
You're fired
for being a scab.

14:09.750 --> 14:11.834
Fired?!
But, sir, this is a huge --

14:11.917 --> 14:13.041
Scab says what?

14:13.125 --> 14:14.834
I really don't --
Scab says what?!

14:14.917 --> 14:17.250
American icons,
take him away!

14:22.709 --> 14:24.583
Would you
look at that?

14:24.667 --> 14:27.417
It's the actual car wash
from "Breaking Bad."

14:27.500 --> 14:29.583
They used
a real car wash.

14:29.667 --> 14:31.375
Unlike those CGI
car washes

14:31.458 --> 14:33.458
Hollywood keeps shoving down
our throats these days.

14:33.542 --> 14:36.709
The clue says "Drive
through the car wash."

14:36.792 --> 14:38.709
Why would he ask us
to clean a rental?

14:38.792 --> 14:40.542
Makes no sense.
Roger's right.

14:40.625 --> 14:41.792
Something's off.

14:41.875 --> 14:43.458
Mom, just drive
through the car wash.

14:43.542 --> 14:46.917
What you have to understand
about Vince Pelican is,

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
when he tells you to zig,
he wants you to zag.

14:51.083 --> 14:52.625
What are you doing?!

14:52.709 --> 14:55.667
Driving through
the car wash!

15:00.500 --> 15:02.709
Oh, reversos!

15:02.792 --> 15:05.291
You found another clue!

15:15.000 --> 15:17.625
Before we begin,
I want to introduce myself.

15:17.709 --> 15:21.083
Name's Hayley Smith.
I am a negotiator at the CIA.

15:21.166 --> 15:22.333
Kind of a rising star
over there.

15:22.417 --> 15:25.750
In fact, the deputy director
of the CIA

15:25.834 --> 15:27.208
hired me personally.

15:27.291 --> 15:31.333
To conclude my brag,
I am a very valuable asset --

15:31.417 --> 15:32.750
worth my weight in gold.

15:32.834 --> 15:35.417
Or, in your currency,
"blood diamonds."

15:37.166 --> 15:38.959
Oh!
You set her free.

15:39.041 --> 15:40.709
My work here is done.

15:42.083 --> 15:44.792
Oh.
I'm a hostage now.

15:44.875 --> 15:47.083
Hope the next negotiator is
as good as I was.

15:53.625 --> 15:55.375
Check it out!

15:55.458 --> 15:58.041
Guess who's gonna be
a Sub Hub employee --

15:58.125 --> 15:59.333
for Halloween!

15:59.417 --> 16:01.208
Oh, have you seen
Hayley?

16:01.291 --> 16:03.917
I'm supposed to ask
when I wear her clothes.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.208
I haven't seen her
since she stole my job.

16:08.417 --> 16:10.166
♪ Sad boy, sad boy ♪

16:10.250 --> 16:11.709
♪ What ya gonna do? ♪

16:11.792 --> 16:15.083
♪ What ya gonna do
when they come for you? ♪

16:15.166 --> 16:18.417
"Sad Boys" is filmed on location
with real sad boys.

16:24.041 --> 16:27.250
So now the warlord is
holding me hostage.

16:27.333 --> 16:29.792
Somehow, he got it in his head
that I'm valuable.

16:31.208 --> 16:33.375
Oh, no!
They've got Hayley?!

16:33.458 --> 16:35.709
I am so sorry, Smith.

16:35.792 --> 16:38.041
I know how big
of a Ravens fan you are.

16:38.125 --> 16:39.917
Sir, please tell me
the Alpha Team

16:40.000 --> 16:41.709
is on their way
to rescue my baby girl.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.667
Unfortunately,
that's not possible.

16:43.750 --> 16:45.959
In the strike,
the agents negotiated

16:46.041 --> 16:47.750
for summer-fun-time hours,

16:47.834 --> 16:50.000
and Alpha Team left
to go speedboating.

16:50.083 --> 16:51.834
I was just about
to join them.

16:53.959 --> 16:55.583
I always get invited

16:55.667 --> 16:57.792
because I'm the best
at applying sunscreen.

16:57.875 --> 16:59.417
Wet swimsuits sag,

16:59.500 --> 17:02.417
so it's important to apply
below the waistline.

17:02.500 --> 17:05.875
Perhaps that could help you
with your dead-daughter problem.

17:08.458 --> 17:11.125
Guess this is
a solo mission.

17:11.208 --> 17:13.166
♪♪

17:13.250 --> 17:15.291
Okay, the clue
at the car wash

17:15.375 --> 17:17.166
led us to
Los Pollos Hermanos...

17:17.250 --> 17:19.959
Where we found the map
on the back of the menu...

17:20.041 --> 17:21.959
That led us to the Mexican
nursing home...

17:22.041 --> 17:24.083
Where I had sex
with five homeless men.

17:24.166 --> 17:26.458
You what?
Oh, that was
a side mission.

17:26.542 --> 17:28.291
Sometimes,
I do side missions a lot.

17:28.375 --> 17:31.458
The last clue says
we should dig right here.

17:38.417 --> 17:39.667
It's a coffin.

17:39.750 --> 17:42.458
Actually, if I know
Vance Gilifinakis,

17:42.542 --> 17:44.041
that's no coffin.

17:44.125 --> 17:46.166
It's a treasure chest.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.250
Well done, reversos!

17:50.333 --> 17:51.834
You found me --
Vince Gilligan.

17:51.917 --> 17:54.333
Let my recorded voice
congratulate you.

17:54.417 --> 17:56.750
After waiting here a few days,
the dry desert air

17:56.834 --> 17:59.208
is bound to have made my
actual voice a little hoarse,

17:59.291 --> 18:01.417
but it was well worth it
for the opportunity

18:01.500 --> 18:04.083
to meet my most loyal fans
and shake their hands,

18:04.166 --> 18:06.250
which I'm sure I'm doing
at this very moment.

18:06.333 --> 18:08.875
I'm proud as punch that
you completed my treasure hunt

18:08.959 --> 18:11.125
before my week of rations
ran out.

18:11.208 --> 18:13.083
But enough recorded talk.

18:13.166 --> 18:15.083
It's time for me to hand you
the treasure

18:15.166 --> 18:17.291
I've been keeping
in my pocket.

18:19.917 --> 18:21.875
It's 100 bucks.

18:21.959 --> 18:25.875
Yay!
Whoo!
All right!

18:35.542 --> 18:37.834
Armed guards
at every entrance.

18:37.917 --> 18:40.875
How can one man stop
an army?

18:42.333 --> 18:44.917
And as if the terrible
work hours aren't bad enough,

18:45.000 --> 18:46.917
I haven't got a raise
in three years.

18:47.041 --> 18:48.166
Tell me about it.

18:48.250 --> 18:49.333
I've been coughing
for weeks

18:49.417 --> 18:50.750
after we burnt down
that school.

18:50.834 --> 18:52.917
What's a guy gotta do
to get an inhaler?

18:53.000 --> 18:54.208
Hmm.

18:54.291 --> 18:56.250
Seems like these
guerilla soldiers have

18:56.333 --> 18:59.458
some unfair
working conditions.

18:59.542 --> 19:02.208
Hey, fellas.
New guy here.

19:02.291 --> 19:04.917
Finally! We've been working
12 hours straight.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.583
Yep, I'm the new guy,
all right.

19:06.667 --> 19:08.083
Transferred from
the Sahara branch.

19:08.166 --> 19:09.458
Great.
We'll see you tomorrow.

19:09.542 --> 19:11.000
Whoa, wait, wait,
wait, wait, fellas!

19:11.083 --> 19:13.625
My story checks out --
new guy, Sahara branch.

19:13.709 --> 19:15.250
It's pretty sweet
over there.

19:15.333 --> 19:17.834
We work summer-fun-time hours
year-round.

19:17.917 --> 19:19.750
But I'm sure it's the same
here, right?

19:19.834 --> 19:22.500
What?! We don't even get paid
extra for weekends.

19:22.583 --> 19:25.375
I'm sorry -- weekends?
That's my time.

19:25.458 --> 19:27.083
I use it to organize
my collection

19:27.166 --> 19:28.542
of looted valuables --

19:28.625 --> 19:30.834
which I get to keep most of,
by the way.

19:30.917 --> 19:33.333
What?! We have to give
all our looted valuables

19:33.417 --> 19:34.542
to the boss!

19:35.959 --> 19:39.125
So you drive your own truck
when you raid villages?

19:39.208 --> 19:41.625
Tell me they reimburse you
for the mileage.

19:43.875 --> 19:45.583
The repetitive motion
from all this shooting

19:45.667 --> 19:47.166
causes
carpal tunnel.

19:47.250 --> 19:49.583
Your health insurance
really should cover that.

19:49.667 --> 19:51.583
You're telling me
child soldiers

19:51.667 --> 19:53.500
make less money than
adult soldiers?!

19:53.583 --> 19:56.125
That is morally
indefensible.

19:56.208 --> 19:58.625
Management thinks
they hold all the power.

19:58.709 --> 20:00.291
But you're the ones
doing all the work.

20:00.375 --> 20:02.709
So how do we show them
who's really in charge?

20:02.792 --> 20:04.333
Murder their families!

20:04.417 --> 20:05.792
Oh, okay.

20:05.875 --> 20:07.417
Let's -- Let's keep that
in our back pocket.

20:07.500 --> 20:11.083
I think the move for right now
is a strike.

20:20.500 --> 20:21.792
Oh, my God! Dad!

20:21.875 --> 20:23.375
In the flesh.

20:24.583 --> 20:25.667
Where's your backup team?

20:25.750 --> 20:27.250
They all had
the afternoon off,

20:27.333 --> 20:28.583
thanks to you
and your strike.

20:28.667 --> 20:30.000
I'm so sorry.

20:30.083 --> 20:31.166
No. Don't be.

20:31.250 --> 20:33.000
You taught me
an important lesson.

20:33.083 --> 20:35.166
There is a time and a place
for striking.

20:35.250 --> 20:37.792
When management puts profits
above the health and welfare

20:37.875 --> 20:39.250
of the workers
who earn it for them?

20:39.333 --> 20:40.583
What?! No.

20:40.667 --> 20:42.208
When you need to destroy
an organization

20:42.291 --> 20:43.458
from the inside.

20:43.542 --> 20:46.375
You're such a dick, Dad.

20:46.458 --> 20:48.000
