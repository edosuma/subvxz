pay your respects...

33:16.745 --> 33:18.361
I'm your father.

33:19.873 --> 33:21.409
I know who you are.

33:27.422 --> 33:29.413
I'm trying to understand

33:31.218 --> 33:34.051
how this happened.

33:36.932 --> 33:39.424
How I let this happen.

33:42.604 --> 33:45.767
I told myself I was
protecting you, but now I...

33:47.901 --> 33:49.437
Those soldiers,

33:52.239 --> 33:54.276
all the people
on that bridge,

33:57.118 --> 33:58.859
and now Rebecca.

34:03.333 --> 34:05.665
They're all dead
because of me.

34:06.294 --> 34:08.706
One little lie

34:08.797 --> 34:12.290
led to a bigger lie
and a bigger lie.

34:15.512 --> 34:19.130
I trapped myself
in all these lies.

34:24.728 --> 34:29.268
But there is one thing
as true now as it ever was.

34:31.277 --> 34:33.143
This country needs you.

34:37.324 --> 34:38.315
The, uh...

34:38.909 --> 34:41.527
The latest poll says that

34:41.663 --> 34:43.904
you had a nine point spike
this morning. (SCOFFS)

34:50.505 --> 34:52.041
That's because of Rebecca.

35:01.600 --> 35:04.217
Why are you telling
me this right now?

35:05.854 --> 35:10.223
So that you would reconsider
what I said last night

35:10.317 --> 35:12.354
about staying in the race.

35:13.737 --> 35:15.853
He never gives up.
Never gives up.

35:18.366 --> 35:23.236
If you drop out, I will turn
myself in to the authorities.

35:25.206 --> 35:29.200
I would've done it before
iflhadthought there was any way

35:29.294 --> 35:30.876
to keep you out of it.

35:32.380 --> 35:34.712
But you need to
know this, son.

35:36.843 --> 35:40.052
Whether I spend what's left of
my life in or out of prison,

35:40.138 --> 35:43.881
I will pay
for what I've done.

35:49.189 --> 35:55.401
But a son should not have to
pay for his father's sins.

35:58.573 --> 36:03.864
And a husband shouldn't profit
from his wife's death.

36:04.829 --> 36:08.242
You would be
honoring her life

36:09.542 --> 36:12.955
by living yours the way
she would've wanted you to.

I can't right now... What?

36:34.442 --> 36:36.809
<i>There's an FBI agent out here,
he says he needs to see you.</i>

36:36.945 --> 36:38.936
<i>Something about DNI Simms.</i>

36:40.782 --> 36:42.443
I'll be right out.

36:56.840 --> 37:00.208
I need to step out
for a few minutes.

37:01.386 --> 37:03.127
Can I stay with her?

37:24.701 --> 37:27.284
Senator, I'm Agent Dietrich.

37:27.370 --> 37:28.735
I'm sorry to disturb you,

37:28.830 --> 37:30.867
but Director Simms
was found dead

37:30.957 --> 37:32.698
in his office
earlier this morning.

37:36.129 --> 37:37.210
Dead?

37:38.173 --> 37:40.084
I understand you were
with him last night.

37:42.969 --> 37:44.585
I was.

37:44.679 --> 37:46.386
Why were you there?

37:53.354 --> 37:55.470
I was asking
about my wife.

37:56.649 --> 37:59.357
What he was doing
to try to find her.

38:04.699 --> 38:08.533
Did he say anything that suggested
he was about to take his life?

38:10.121 --> 38:13.034
No. No. Nothing.

38:17.003 --> 38:19.461
I'm really sorry
to hear about Donald.

38:21.382 --> 38:23.874
But I've got my own situation
that I'm dealing with right now.

38:24.969 --> 38:26.380
Of course, Senator,
I understand.

38:27.305 --> 38:28.887
Thank you for your time.

38:39.067 --> 38:44.403
I think I'd like to cancel that
call to the party headquarters.

38:46.574 --> 38:47.689
NILAA: The sooner
they know,

38:47.784 --> 38:49.695
the sooner they can pick
another candidate.

38:51.287 --> 38:53.699
I'm not dropping
out of the race.

38:57.502 --> 38:59.584
We need to talk
this through.

39:10.431 --> 39:14.095
Mr. Carter, Director
Mullins is expecting you.

39:14.185 --> 39:17.678
Yeah. Uh, my wife is here.

39:17.772 --> 39:19.854
I'd like to talk to her
before the debrief.

39:19.941 --> 39:21.557
Certainly, she's in
his office right now.

39:21.651 --> 39:23.062
Thank you.

39:24.737 --> 39:27.104
They told me the funeral's
gonna be tomorrow.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.609
Family only.

39:29.158 --> 39:32.617
But there will be a memorial
service in a couple of weeks.

Yeah.

arrived for his debrief.

39:47.719 --> 39:50.632

right with him. Thanks.

Eric.

40:14.329 --> 40:15.569
Are you okay?

40:15.663 --> 40:17.995
(GROANS SOFTLY)
Yeah, I'm just...

40:18.082 --> 40:20.039
I, uh...
Oh, I'm so sorry.

40:20.168 --> 40:22.159
No, it's more stitches
than I can count,

40:25.048 --> 40:26.538
but I can't really complain.

40:28.009 --> 40:29.966
I'm so sorry about Rebecca.

40:31.888 --> 40:33.094
I know.

40:36.517 --> 40:38.007
Where's Isaac?

40:39.604 --> 40:41.766
Um, he had to go.

40:42.440 --> 40:45.228
He, um, said he just
needed some time alone.

40:46.235 --> 40:47.942
He's going through
a lot right now.

40:49.530 --> 40:50.895

Look, Eric, I just...
Look, no, Nicole, I, um...

41:00.458 --> 41:02.699
I wasn't being
honest with you,

41:04.087 --> 41:05.998
and for that, I'm sorry.

41:08.216 --> 41:09.923
But you were right.

41:13.388 --> 41:14.753
I need this.

41:16.015 --> 41:19.428
This is where I belong.

41:22.772 --> 41:24.137
I get that.

what you need...

41:32.573 --> 41:34.029
...then I want
to make it work.

41:36.911 --> 41:38.777
I'm not going
to lose you, Eric.

41:40.331 --> 41:41.412
I love you.

41:42.750 --> 41:44.866
No, Nicole, listen.

41:45.837 --> 41:46.872
I've seen this life, okay?

41:46.963 --> 41:49.671
And what it does to people, what
it does to families and I can't...

41:49.757 --> 41:53.341
I don't care. Whatever happens,
we can get through it.

41:53.428 --> 41:56.341
Like we've always done.
This is what we do.

41:58.266 --> 42:03.261
All I ask is one thing, that
we're honest with each other.

42:04.355 --> 42:05.937
No more secrets.

42:13.781 --> 42:15.112
No more secrets.

42:26.794 --> 42:29.161
I got to...
Yeah, go. I'll be here.
