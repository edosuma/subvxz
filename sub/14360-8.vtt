WEBVTT

00:03.671 --> 00:07.299
Oh, with the boys asleep

00:03.671 --> 00:07.299
this house is so quiet.

00:07.341 --> 00:08.258
Mm-hmm.

00:08.300 --> 00:10.845
Such a nice idea

00:08.300 --> 00:10.845
to build a fire.

00:10.886 --> 00:12.429
Yeah.

00:12.471 --> 00:14.055
Hey, I didn't

00:12.471 --> 00:14.055
build the fire.

00:14.097 --> 00:16.057
I thought you

00:14.097 --> 00:16.057
built the fire.

00:21.396 --> 00:26.234
Well, looks like Reese

00:21.396 --> 00:26.234
got a "D" in English.

00:26.276 --> 00:30.447
And Dewey seems

00:26.276 --> 00:30.447
to be fighting again.

00:30.489 --> 00:31.866
Biting.

00:31.907 --> 00:33.158
Oh, Malcolm,

00:31.907 --> 00:33.158
tell your teacher

00:33.200 --> 00:35.744
I'd love to chaperone

00:33.200 --> 00:35.744
the class overnight.

00:35.786 --> 00:37.663
We can share a tent.

I can't believe Mr. Herkabe

01:12.155 --> 01:14.115
let you do a video project

01:12.155 --> 01:14.115
instead of a paper.

01:14.157 --> 01:16.827
You could've... asked.

01:16.869 --> 01:19.287
I don't have parents rich enough

01:16.869 --> 01:19.287
to buy me a video camera.

01:19.329 --> 01:22.541
Rich... and compensating.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.959
I don't even know what

01:22.583 --> 01:23.959
I'm going to write about.

01:24.001 --> 01:26.127
I mean, what's your movie

01:24.001 --> 01:26.127
going to be about?

01:26.169 --> 01:29.798
The creative... process.

01:29.840 --> 01:33.134
You writing... your paper.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.595
Is that thing on?

01:33.176 --> 01:34.595
Turn it off!

01:34.636 --> 01:36.137
I don't even have

01:34.636 --> 01:36.137
an idea yet.

01:36.179 --> 01:37.598
You're going to make me

01:36.179 --> 01:37.598
look like an idiot.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.058
I'm serious!

01:39.098 --> 01:41.142
This is... great.

01:41.184 --> 01:44.145
Now knock... me over.

01:41.184 --> 01:44.145
(phone rings)

01:44.187 --> 01:45.188
Hello.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.857
Hey, it's Abe.

01:46.899 --> 01:48.149
Oh, hey!

01:48.191 --> 01:49.317
I know it's short notice,

01:49.359 --> 01:50.986
but someone dropped out

01:49.359 --> 01:50.986
of our poker game.

01:51.028 --> 01:52.153
Can you make it tonight?

01:52.195 --> 01:53.572
Are you kidding?

01:52.195 --> 01:53.572
I have been waiting

01:53.614 --> 01:55.240
for you to invite me

01:53.614 --> 01:55.240
for months!

01:55.282 --> 01:56.157
See you at 8:00.

01:56.199 --> 01:57.952
Thanks!

01:57.993 --> 01:59.828
Hot-cha!

01:59.870 --> 02:01.162
(laughing)

02:01.204 --> 02:02.581
Honey, honey, guess

02:01.204 --> 02:02.581
what, guess what?

02:02.623 --> 02:04.833
Guess what? I'm going to go

02:02.623 --> 02:04.833
play poker at Abe's tonight.

02:04.875 --> 02:05.751
He just asked me!

02:05.793 --> 02:07.962
Hal, tonight's

02:05.793 --> 02:07.962
our first dance class.

02:08.003 --> 02:11.548
That's tonight?

02:08.003 --> 02:11.548
Yes, it was

02:08.003 --> 02:11.548
your birthday present to me.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.926
Oh.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.111
Fine, go play poker.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.904
I love you!

02:33.946 --> 02:35.030
(laughing)

02:35.072 --> 02:37.365
Great, now who am I

02:35.072 --> 02:37.365
going to go with?

02:37.407 --> 02:40.119
Did Reese

02:37.407 --> 02:40.119
finish his homework yet?

02:40.160 --> 02:41.787
Of course I finished

02:40.160 --> 02:41.787
my homework.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.455
Good. You can come

02:41.829 --> 02:43.455
to dance class with me.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.999
What? No, I was lying.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.291
I didn't finish my homework.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.794
I don't even know

02:46.333 --> 02:48.794
what my homework is!

02:48.836 --> 02:50.295
Go get your shoes.

02:53.048 --> 02:54.591
(electricity crackling)

02:54.633 --> 02:56.217
If the weather report's right,

02:56.259 --> 02:58.219
this storm's going to last

02:56.259 --> 02:58.219
a week.

02:58.261 --> 03:01.222
Now, you ration these supplies.

03:01.264 --> 03:02.599
And make no mistake--

03:02.641 --> 03:04.810
you're the last ones

03:02.641 --> 03:04.810
we'll dig out.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.269
We're supposed to

03:04.852 --> 03:06.269
live for a week

03:06.311 --> 03:08.438
on meat paste

03:06.311 --> 03:08.438
and caribou jerky?

03:08.480 --> 03:12.026
Hey, that's a week I don't get

03:08.480 --> 03:12.026
any work out of you.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.736
No one's crying for me!

03:16.738 --> 03:18.532
Now, it's just a friendly game.

03:18.573 --> 03:19.908
Mostly we sit around talking,

03:19.950 --> 03:22.410
but eventually we get around

03:19.950 --> 03:22.410
to playing cards.

03:22.452 --> 03:23.453
Sounds good to me.

03:23.495 --> 03:25.873
I'm looking forward

03:23.495 --> 03:25.873
to meeting your friends.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.960
Everybody, this is Hal.

03:30.002 --> 03:31.586
Hal.

03:30.002 --> 03:31.586
Hello, Hal.

03:33.338 --> 03:36.758
Hal, this is Brian, Trey,

03:33.338 --> 03:36.758
Steve and Malik.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.301
Hi.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.887
It's great to meet you guys.

03:39.928 --> 03:41.346
(murmuring)

03:41.388 --> 03:43.724
So, what's the buy-in?

03:43.765 --> 03:45.266
Fifty dollars.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.188
Okay.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.313
There.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.272
What's with Wanda?

03:51.314 --> 03:53.441
Ain't no thing.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.736
Oh... oh... whoops!

03:56.987 --> 03:58.906
(all laughing)

04:00.199 --> 04:01.909
Put a dollar in the pot.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.287
Oh, we got a regular

04:04.327 --> 04:06.287
D-Dog here.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.707
(laughter)

04:09.332 --> 04:11.292
And right, left,

04:09.332 --> 04:11.292
cha-cha-cha.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.461
And remember, God

04:11.334 --> 04:13.461
created artificial

04:11.334 --> 04:13.461
hips for a reason.

04:13.503 --> 04:14.671
Let's use them.

04:14.713 --> 04:17.298
And, back, two,

04:14.713 --> 04:17.298
cha-cha, finish.

04:17.340 --> 04:18.299
All right, very good.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.594
Everyone, let's pair up.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.306
May I?

04:25.348 --> 04:27.517
Oh, okay.

04:30.812 --> 04:31.521
No way.

04:31.563 --> 04:34.816
You be a gentleman!

04:36.359 --> 04:38.319
It's just like

04:36.359 --> 04:38.319
touching a dead person.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.321
It's just like touching

04:38.361 --> 04:40.321
a dead person.

04:40.363 --> 04:43.117
Goodness, how many

04:40.363 --> 04:43.117
lessons have you had?

04:43.158 --> 04:44.325
What? None.

04:44.367 --> 04:45.911
Really? I'm impressed.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.955
You have very

04:45.953 --> 04:47.955
good instincts.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.039
I do?

04:47.996 --> 04:49.039
Mm-hmm.

04:49.081 --> 04:50.498
I'm not surprised.

04:50.540 --> 04:51.499
You're built for it.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.127
You have a dancer's ankles.

04:53.168 --> 04:55.712
I do not.

04:55.754 --> 04:58.048
You're a lovely

04:55.754 --> 04:58.048
young man.

04:58.090 --> 05:01.342
You don't shake like

04:58.090 --> 05:01.342
all the other men here.

05:01.384 --> 05:02.970
Mind if I cut in?

05:03.011 --> 05:04.512
You wait your turn!

05:04.554 --> 05:07.849
I'll give you five bucks

05:04.554 --> 05:07.849
to dance with me.

05:07.891 --> 05:09.059
Okay.

05:17.776 --> 05:19.236
(sighs)

05:19.861 --> 05:24.365
And still...

05:19.861 --> 05:24.365
he has... nothing.

05:24.407 --> 05:26.409
All right, you know what?

05:24.407 --> 05:26.409
That's it.

05:26.451 --> 05:30.289
I'm writing about you

05:26.451 --> 05:30.289
doing your movie.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.791
But my movie's...

05:30.330 --> 05:32.791
about your paper.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.835
Yeah, I'm doing

05:32.833 --> 05:34.835
my paper

05:34.876 --> 05:38.797
about you doing your movie

05:34.876 --> 05:38.797
about me doing my paper.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.465
Fine!

05:40.507 --> 05:43.302
My movie's...

05:43.342 --> 05:47.388
about you doing...

05:47.430 --> 05:50.475
your paper...

05:50.517 --> 05:53.979
about me doing...

05:54.021 --> 05:55.314
my...

05:55.396 --> 05:56.397
All right! I get it.

05:56.439 --> 05:59.400
...movie...

05:59.442 --> 06:00.401
about you...

06:00.443 --> 06:01.903
Hey, guys,

06:00.443 --> 06:01.903
you know what you should

06:01.945 --> 06:03.613
do your movie about?

06:01.945 --> 06:03.613
Old people.

06:03.655 --> 06:05.032
Did you know

06:03.655 --> 06:05.032
that some of them

06:05.073 --> 06:07.408
have spent their entire lives

06:05.073 --> 06:07.408
saving money

06:07.450 --> 06:09.410
only to find out

06:07.450 --> 06:09.410
they've outlived everybody

06:09.452 --> 06:11.079
they want to share it with?

06:11.121 --> 06:13.915
Talk about sad.

06:19.462 --> 06:20.881
I raise you five.

06:20.922 --> 06:23.758
I see your five,

06:20.922 --> 06:23.758
and I raise you...

06:29.056 --> 06:31.058
two.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.434
Call.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.436
Full house, kings over eights.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.147
Straight flush

06:35.478 --> 06:37.147
to the jack!

06:37.189 --> 06:38.106
(laughter)

06:38.148 --> 06:39.233
I knew you had it!

06:39.274 --> 06:40.359
How could you know that?

06:40.399 --> 06:41.818
He had...

06:40.399 --> 06:41.818
he had nothing on top!

06:41.860 --> 06:44.071
Trey never stays in unless

06:41.860 --> 06:44.071
he's got something good.

06:44.112 --> 06:47.741
ABE:

06:44.112 --> 06:47.741
Perhaps we should

06:44.112 --> 06:47.741
call it a night.

06:47.782 --> 06:50.451
We are definitely

06:47.782 --> 06:50.451
bringing you back.

06:50.493 --> 06:51.619
(all laughing)

06:51.661 --> 06:53.330
Hey, Brian, when

06:51.661 --> 06:53.330
was the last time

06:53.372 --> 06:54.455
you were ahead

06:53.372 --> 06:54.455
for an evening?

06:54.497 --> 06:56.041
TREY:

06:54.497 --> 06:56.041
He can't remember

06:54.497 --> 06:56.041
that far back.

06:56.083 --> 06:59.294
Now you got something to sneak

06:56.083 --> 06:59.294
into  your wife's purse.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.380
(all laughing)

07:06.927 --> 07:09.470
I had the most wonderful time

07:06.927 --> 07:09.470
in dance class.

07:09.512 --> 07:10.471
Every time the instructor

07:10.513 --> 07:11.848
needed to show

07:10.513 --> 07:11.848
the class something,

07:11.890 --> 07:13.641
he used me as his partner.

07:13.683 --> 07:16.311
I always thought

07:13.683 --> 07:16.311
I was such a clodhopper.

07:16.353 --> 07:17.478
I cannot believe

07:17.520 --> 07:19.898
what I have missed

07:17.520 --> 07:19.898
all these years.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.649
Oh, how was

07:19.940 --> 07:21.649
your poker game?

07:21.691 --> 07:23.068
Hmm?

07:23.110 --> 07:24.194
It was great.

07:24.236 --> 07:25.404
Why wouldn't it be?

07:25.445 --> 07:26.487
I love Abe.

07:26.529 --> 07:27.488
I love poker.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.490
A whole night playing

07:27.530 --> 07:29.490
poker with Abe...

07:29.532 --> 07:30.575
and his friends.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.660
The teacher thinks

07:30.617 --> 07:32.660
I have dancer's ankles.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.495
What do you think, huh?

07:34.537 --> 07:36.748
You want to dance

07:34.537 --> 07:36.748
with the star pupil?

07:36.790 --> 07:37.540
What?

07:37.582 --> 07:39.376
You know... dance?

07:39.418 --> 07:41.502
No, I'm not in the mood.

07:41.544 --> 07:42.879
You're always

07:41.544 --> 07:42.879
in the mood.

07:42.921 --> 07:45.173
Not every single

07:42.921 --> 07:45.173
night of my life.

07:45.215 --> 07:46.341
Yes, you are.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.093
I'm not like some

07:46.383 --> 07:48.093
kind of machine.

07:48.135 --> 07:48.969
Yes, you are.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.511
You can't just

07:49.010 --> 07:50.511
snap your fingers...

07:50.553 --> 07:53.514
Yes, I can.

07:50.553 --> 07:53.514
I always have.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.809
Oh, all right.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.688
Palm kernel oil,

08:00.730 --> 08:03.358
pectin, manganese sulfate

08:03.400 --> 08:05.526
and...

08:05.568 --> 08:06.694
zinc oxide?

08:06.736 --> 08:09.197
Yes, that's

08:06.736 --> 08:09.197
meat paste, baby.

08:09.239 --> 08:10.531
Man, this sucks!

08:10.573 --> 08:12.575
We knew we were going to be

08:10.573 --> 08:12.575
stuck here for a week

08:12.617 --> 08:14.453
and no one even bothered

08:12.617 --> 08:14.453
to grab a deck of cards

08:14.494 --> 08:15.578
or a magazine.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.538
I could do

08:15.620 --> 08:17.538
my foot puppets again.

08:17.580 --> 08:18.957
Please, no.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.418
How long have we

08:18.999 --> 08:21.418
been stuck here for?

08:21.460 --> 08:24.421
I have lost

08:21.460 --> 08:24.421
all sense of time.

08:24.463 --> 08:25.588
I guess about five days.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.590
We've just got to keep

08:25.630 --> 08:27.590
ourselves busy.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.134
Tell you what.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.551
Let's put our heads

08:29.176 --> 08:30.551
together and recreate

08:30.593 --> 08:32.553
whole episodes of

08:30.593 --> 08:32.553
Gilligan's Island.

08:32.595 --> 08:34.389
We already did that.

08:34.431 --> 08:35.640
That was this storm?

08:35.682 --> 08:37.558
Look, if we don't

08:35.682 --> 08:37.558
come up with something to do,

08:37.600 --> 08:40.979
I'm going to go insane.

08:49.612 --> 08:51.031
(grunting)

08:51.072 --> 08:53.367
Come on, Reese,

08:51.072 --> 08:53.367
we don't want to be late.

08:53.408 --> 08:54.742
We're doing

08:53.408 --> 08:54.742
the mambo tonight.

08:54.784 --> 08:57.454
I'll home about 10:30.

08:57.496 --> 08:58.579
(yelling)

08:58.621 --> 08:59.580
What are you doing?

08:59.622 --> 09:00.957
Is it too much to ask

08:59.622 --> 09:00.957
that we get

09:00.999 --> 09:02.667
some pickles in this house

09:00.999 --> 09:02.667
that are edible?

09:02.709 --> 09:04.585
Hal, what's wrong?

09:02.709 --> 09:04.585
Nothing.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.296
Just... just go

09:04.627 --> 09:06.296
to your class.

09:06.338 --> 09:10.884
Look, you have been snapping

09:06.338 --> 09:10.884
at everybody all week.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.594
My class can

09:11.634 --> 09:13.594
wait one minute.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.972
Now, you tell me

09:13.636 --> 09:15.972
what's going on.

09:16.014 --> 09:17.391
All right.

09:17.432 --> 09:19.851
This thing happened and

09:17.432 --> 09:19.851
I didn't want to talk about it

09:19.893 --> 09:21.811
because I wasn't sure

09:19.893 --> 09:21.811
it actually happened,

09:21.853 --> 09:23.813
and if it didn't, I'd be like

09:21.853 --> 09:23.813
the biggest jerk in the world

09:23.855 --> 09:25.190
for saying that it did

09:23.855 --> 09:25.190
when it didn't.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.691
I'd be creating

09:25.232 --> 09:26.691
this whole big issue.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.109
But, you know what,

09:26.733 --> 09:28.109
the more I think about it,

09:28.151 --> 09:29.610
the more I realize

09:28.151 --> 09:29.610
it did happen.

09:29.652 --> 09:30.904
Oh, it did!

09:30.945 --> 09:32.197
(Hal continues talking)

09:30.945 --> 09:32.197
You know, Dewey,

09:32.239 --> 09:33.823
I've recently come

09:32.239 --> 09:33.823
into a little money.

09:33.865 --> 09:36.784
So I went to the mall to

09:33.865 --> 09:36.784
buy myself a CD player,

09:36.826 --> 09:39.662
and then I saw

09:36.826 --> 09:39.662
this little kid that

09:36.826 --> 09:39.662
reminded me of you.

09:39.704 --> 09:42.290
And I thought of a

09:39.704 --> 09:42.290
better way to spend it.

09:42.332 --> 09:44.459
So, here.

09:44.501 --> 09:46.920
Wow!

09:51.091 --> 09:52.342
Oh, my God!

09:52.384 --> 09:54.469
The look on your face--

09:52.384 --> 09:54.469
that was totally worth it!

09:54.511 --> 09:56.804
You're the worst brother ever.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.223
I know! I know!

09:58.265 --> 10:00.141
HAL:

09:58.265 --> 10:00.141
Because I was there

09:58.265 --> 10:00.141
when it happened!

10:00.183 --> 10:02.102
Oh, we like to think that

10:00.183 --> 10:02.102
the differences people have

10:02.143 --> 10:03.644
aren't really

10:02.143 --> 10:03.644
differences at all,

10:03.686 --> 10:05.272
but then suddenly

10:03.686 --> 10:05.272
you're on the outside

10:05.313 --> 10:07.648
being taken advantage of

10:05.313 --> 10:07.648
because you're different.

10:07.690 --> 10:08.733
Honey, I'm sorry.

10:07.690 --> 10:08.733
I got to go.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.528
We can talk

10:08.775 --> 10:11.528
later. Bye.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.536
(muttering quietly)

10:19.578 --> 10:20.661

10:28.711 --> 10:30.671

10:33.425 --> 10:34.759

10:34.801 --> 10:36.677

10:36.719 --> 10:38.054
ABE: Hello.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.054
Abe, it's Hal.

10:38.096 --> 10:39.680
You've reached

10:38.096 --> 10:39.680
Kenarbans.

10:39.722 --> 10:42.892
Please leave a message

10:39.722 --> 10:42.892
after the beep.

10:45.186 --> 10:46.146
Abe, it's Hal.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.730
I don't know if

10:46.187 --> 10:47.730
this is recording,

10:47.772 --> 10:50.066
but we have something

10:47.772 --> 10:50.066
we need to talk about.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.859
Now, I could be mistaken,

10:50.108 --> 10:51.859
and If I am

10:51.901 --> 10:54.279
I'm sure it's going to make me

10:51.901 --> 10:54.279
sound like I'm an idiot...

10:54.321 --> 10:55.614

10:55.655 --> 10:58.158

11:00.535 --> 11:01.702
(groans)

11:01.744 --> 11:03.704
Dad, Stevie's being

11:01.744 --> 11:03.704
really annoying.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.706
He's filming

11:03.746 --> 11:05.706
everything I do.

11:05.748 --> 11:06.707
Malcolm's being...

11:06.749 --> 11:08.709
Damn it, Stevie,

11:06.749 --> 11:08.709
I don't want to hear it.

11:08.751 --> 11:09.794
You just behave yourself.

11:09.836 --> 11:12.088
You are a guest

11:09.836 --> 11:12.088
in this house.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.007
He was a guest

11:12.130 --> 11:14.007
in your house.

11:14.048 --> 11:16.426
People should never

11:14.048 --> 11:16.426
yell at children.

11:16.468 --> 11:19.513
Especially children

11:16.468 --> 11:19.513
that aren't their own.

11:19.554 --> 11:21.973
I apologized

11:19.554 --> 11:21.973
two minutes later,

11:22.015 --> 11:25.018
and Stevie accepted

11:22.015 --> 11:25.018
the apology.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.603
You know, he's not

11:25.059 --> 11:26.603
that fragile,

11:26.645 --> 11:27.728
so why don't

11:26.645 --> 11:27.728
you just relax.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.606
Really.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.606
What?

11:29.648 --> 11:31.441
At least I'm man enough

11:29.648 --> 11:31.441
to apologize

11:31.483 --> 11:32.609
when I've been a jerk.

11:32.651 --> 11:34.194
What is that

11:32.651 --> 11:34.194
supposed to mean?

11:34.235 --> 11:36.029
You know darn well

11:34.235 --> 11:36.029
what I'm talking about.

11:36.070 --> 11:38.739
The way you and our friends

11:36.070 --> 11:38.739
treated me the other night.

11:38.781 --> 11:39.740
What?

11:39.782 --> 11:40.741
Oh, please.

11:40.783 --> 11:41.909
Look, obviously

11:40.783 --> 11:41.909
I'm different.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.578
I mean, I walked

11:41.951 --> 11:43.578
through that door

11:43.620 --> 11:44.912
and stuck out like

11:43.620 --> 11:44.912
a sore thumb.

11:44.954 --> 11:47.165
I always thought

11:44.954 --> 11:47.165
those things didn't

11:44.954 --> 11:47.165
matter, but...

11:47.207 --> 11:50.043
If you're implying what

11:47.207 --> 11:50.043
I think you're implying...

11:50.084 --> 11:51.752
You want me to just

11:50.084 --> 11:51.752
come out and say it?

11:51.794 --> 11:52.753
I think you'd better.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.549
Fine. You and your

11:52.795 --> 11:55.549
poker buddies

11:55.590 --> 11:56.757
all ganged up on me

11:56.799 --> 11:59.760
because I'm not

11:56.799 --> 11:59.760
a professional.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.762
Excuse me?!

11:59.802 --> 12:01.762
Yeah, you

12:01.804 --> 12:03.557
and your doctor friend

12:01.804 --> 12:03.557
and your lawyer friend

12:03.598 --> 12:04.765
and your dentist friend.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.809
You decided it was okay

12:04.807 --> 12:06.809
to skin a guy

12:06.851 --> 12:08.853
just because he's

12:06.851 --> 12:08.853
a working stiff.

12:08.895 --> 12:11.772
And I bet you had a big laugh

12:08.895 --> 12:11.772
about it afterwards.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.941
Listen, you idiot,

12:11.814 --> 12:13.941
we didn't gang up on you.

12:13.983 --> 12:16.277
You just stink at poker.

12:13.983 --> 12:16.277
Oh, is that right?

12:16.319 --> 12:17.778
(arguing continues)

12:16.319 --> 12:17.778

14:18.107 --> 14:19.818
Nothing. I'm just saying

14:18.107 --> 14:19.818
I don't have the string.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.110
You're the last person

14:19.859 --> 14:21.110
I saw it with.

14:21.152 --> 14:22.903
What the hell are

14:21.152 --> 14:22.903
we going to do

14:22.945 --> 14:23.904
without that string?

14:23.946 --> 14:26.741
Guys, come on.

14:23.946 --> 14:26.741
It's just a stupid string.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.911
So what do you think

14:29.160 --> 14:30.911
would be a reason

14:30.953 --> 14:31.912
for saying that, Eric?

14:31.954 --> 14:32.955
You're the only one

14:32.997 --> 14:34.915
who seems to have a motive

14:32.997 --> 14:34.915
against the string.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.917
No, I love the string.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.917
It's just...

14:36.959 --> 14:38.712
Maybe you loved it

14:36.959 --> 14:38.712
a little too much.

14:38.753 --> 14:40.171
And I quote,

14:40.213 --> 14:43.424
"If I can't have

14:40.213 --> 14:43.424
the string, no one will."

14:43.466 --> 14:44.634
I didn't say that!

14:44.676 --> 14:45.510
Well, someone said it!

14:45.552 --> 14:46.927
You just now!

14:46.969 --> 14:48.722
Don't try to twist

14:46.969 --> 14:48.722
this around.

14:48.763 --> 14:49.930
He's not the one

14:48.763 --> 14:49.930
on trial.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.932
What trial?!

14:51.974 --> 14:54.060
Guilty!

15:13.580 --> 15:15.164
He raises four.

15:15.206 --> 15:17.958
Your four,

15:15.206 --> 15:17.958
five more.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.252
Malcolm, maybe...

15:19.293 --> 15:21.337
You want to play?

15:19.293 --> 15:21.337
Fine.

15:21.379 --> 15:23.548
I almost feel

15:21.379 --> 15:23.548
sorry for them.

15:23.590 --> 15:24.549
Almost.

15:24.591 --> 15:25.759
(laughs)

15:25.800 --> 15:28.762
All right, we're going

15:25.800 --> 15:28.762
to end this right here.

15:28.803 --> 15:29.763
Winner take all.

15:29.804 --> 15:31.972
Fine.

15:32.014 --> 15:32.807
Turn 'em up.

15:32.849 --> 15:33.974
Three fives.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.894
Three fives with a jack.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.645
Yeah!

15:39.021 --> 15:41.482
That makes six fives!

15:41.524 --> 15:44.193
What the hell kind

15:41.524 --> 15:44.193
of deck has six fives!

15:44.235 --> 15:45.986
I don't know.

15:44.235 --> 15:45.986
I got 'em from the boys' room.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.154
You call yourself

15:46.028 --> 15:47.154
a poker player?

15:47.196 --> 15:48.865
You don't even have

15:47.196 --> 15:48.865
a decent deck.

15:48.907 --> 15:49.866
Well, I'm sorry

15:49.908 --> 15:51.409
I don't have

15:49.908 --> 15:51.409
solid gold playing cards

15:51.451 --> 15:53.453
like you're accustomed to

15:51.451 --> 15:53.453
at your house.

15:53.494 --> 15:55.996
This poor-guy act is

15:53.494 --> 15:55.996
getting a little tiring!

15:56.038 --> 15:58.708
Your superior act

15:56.038 --> 15:58.708
is getting a little old, too.

15:58.750 --> 16:01.001
If I'm such a big jerk

15:58.750 --> 16:01.001
why'd you even come over?!

16:01.043 --> 16:03.003
Pardon me for wanting

16:01.043 --> 16:03.003
to play poker

16:03.045 --> 16:05.214
with my best friend!

16:09.844 --> 16:14.014
I mean, I was really excited

16:09.844 --> 16:14.014
to come over and play poker

16:14.056 --> 16:16.893
and meet your other friends.

16:18.978 --> 16:24.275
Truth be told, I was excited

16:18.978 --> 16:24.275
for you to come over, too.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.653
I bought a new shirt.

16:26.694 --> 16:27.862
That Hawaiian one?

16:28.696 --> 16:31.157
I like that one.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.035
Why are we fighting

16:33.075 --> 16:35.035
like this?

16:35.077 --> 16:37.538
Because we're idiots!

16:37.580 --> 16:39.874
(both laugh)

16:42.919 --> 16:45.546
(both laugh)

16:47.089 --> 16:49.091
Well, boys, what do you say

16:47.089 --> 16:49.091
we all go out

16:49.133 --> 16:50.551
to get some ice cream?

16:50.593 --> 16:51.845
Sounds good to me.

16:51.886 --> 16:55.222
Hey, Dewey, come on.

16:51.886 --> 16:55.222
We're going for ice cream.

16:55.264 --> 16:56.975
Where's your brother?

16:57.016 --> 16:58.476
REESE:

16:57.016 --> 16:58.476
You see this, ladies?

16:58.518 --> 17:00.561
Mrs. Angela's going

16:58.518 --> 17:00.561
to get her dance.

17:00.603 --> 17:03.523
As for the rest of you,

17:00.603 --> 17:03.523
I'm not running a charity here.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.733
You have to come up

17:03.564 --> 17:05.733
with the dough!

17:05.775 --> 17:07.861
I do not dance on credit.

17:07.902 --> 17:09.362
No offense, but some of you

17:09.403 --> 17:12.281
might not even be around

17:09.403 --> 17:12.281
next week.

17:17.996 --> 17:19.706
(waltz playing)

17:56.868 --> 17:58.494
(cheering)

17:58.536 --> 18:01.288
(laughs)

18:01.330 --> 18:03.123
Oh, I didn't want

18:01.330 --> 18:03.123
that to end.

18:03.165 --> 18:04.375
That does it.

18:04.417 --> 18:07.211
I'm signing up

18:04.417 --> 18:07.211
for your Monday-

18:04.417 --> 18:07.211
Wednesday class.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.838
Maybe Saturday, too.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.130
But first I've got to...

18:10.172 --> 18:12.884
Lois, Lois, please.

18:10.172 --> 18:12.884
Come-come with me.

18:17.179 --> 18:18.138
Uh...

18:18.180 --> 18:20.433
We have to stop this.

18:20.474 --> 18:21.308
Why?

18:21.350 --> 18:23.143
Honey, you've outgrown me.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.312
I give beginning

18:23.185 --> 18:25.312
dance lessons,

18:25.354 --> 18:28.148
usually to people

18:25.354 --> 18:28.148
who can barely move.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.317
Now...

18:30.359 --> 18:32.779
this is another instructor.

18:32.820 --> 18:35.865
He's across town,

18:32.820 --> 18:35.865
but he is the best.

18:35.907 --> 18:39.326
He's the only one

18:35.907 --> 18:39.326
who can take you

18:35.907 --> 18:39.326
to the next level.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.746
But I really love it here.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.999
Lois, you have a gift.

18:45.041 --> 18:47.167
You mustn't waste it.

18:47.209 --> 18:50.797
It's time for you

18:47.209 --> 18:50.797
to-to spread your wings...

18:52.006 --> 18:54.174
...and fly.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.427
Fly away, little bird.

19:00.640 --> 19:01.599
Oh, my God!

19:01.641 --> 19:04.351
Francis,  you're

19:01.641 --> 19:04.351
going to do it?!

19:04.393 --> 19:05.645
Hey, I'm your best friend.

19:05.686 --> 19:07.563
I'm not going to let

19:05.686 --> 19:07.563
one of these jerks brand you.

19:07.605 --> 19:09.356
Now everyone's

19:07.605 --> 19:09.356

Vacation's over.

19:19.241 --> 19:21.494
He took the string.

19:26.248 --> 19:29.335
Every damn storm.

19:31.629 --> 19:36.216
So, Dewey, how come
