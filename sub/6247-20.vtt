WEBVTT

00:04.920 --> 00:08.515
- Um, Agent Booth?
- Yes, Angela?

00:08.600 --> 00:11.956
This is the paediatric
cancer floor of the hospitaI.

00:12.040 --> 00:13.951
Mm-hm. Yeah.

00:14.040 --> 00:18.352
Right, well, what I'm about to show
Deputy Director Cullen is kinda gruesome.

00:18.440 --> 00:22.115
- Why are we meeting Cullen here?
- He's the deputy director of the FBI.

00:22.200 --> 00:25.397
This is where he wants
us to show it to him.

00:26.680 --> 00:32.835
OK, listen. About a month ago his daughter
Amy was diagnosed with cancer. Meso...

00:32.920 --> 00:35.434
- Mesothelioma. Lung cancer.
- Exactly.

00:35.520 --> 00:40.833
So she's not doing so well, so it's a lot
easier for us to come to him right now.

00:40.920 --> 00:43.115
- Huh.
- "Huh" what?

00:43.200 --> 00:46.237
Nothing. It's just an extremely
rare form of lung cancer.

00:46.320 --> 00:49.471
- Odd for someone Amy's age to contract.
- No, no, no.

00:49.560 --> 00:53.030
No probing, OK? Not to
Cullen, not to his family.

00:53.120 --> 00:58.911
It'll take five minutes. We do the show and
tell relating to the case, then we're out. Clear?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.558
- It's peculiar.
- No!

01:00.640 --> 01:04.235
- But I... You have to admit...
- Booth.

01:04.319 --> 01:06.675
Dr Brennan.

01:06.760 --> 01:09.638
How appropriate
- bickering in an adolescent wing.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.870
Sir, yes. Um...

01:11.960 --> 01:14.520
Is it OK if we come in, sir?

01:15.720 --> 01:20.316
- What do you think, sweetheart?
- Booth's cooI, most of the time.

01:20.400 --> 01:23.119
- You heard the lady.
You're cooI. - Mm-hm.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.475
Yeah, right.

01:31.320 --> 01:34.118
Are you sure it's all right
for me to do this here?

01:34.200 --> 01:36.919
Nothing I haven't seen before.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.870
- Let's see what you got here, Angela. -
The estimated time of death is mid-June.

01:42.960 --> 01:48.910
Extreme humidity combined with insects and
precipitation accelerated the rate of decomp.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.916
<i>- So the body was not mutilated after death?
- The effects were environmentaI.</i>

01:56.000 --> 02:01.199
- Murder doesn't fit the suspect's profile, sir.
- It's not nice to fooI Mother Nature.

02:01.280 --> 02:07.071
- I'd like to see this again.
- Knock yourself out, sir. 86 times is our limit.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.354
Can I see your drawings?

02:09.440 --> 02:13.513
- Wow. These are beautifuI.
- Our artist in the making.

02:13.600 --> 02:17.639
Right now I'm doing landscapes. I'm
really into this French dude, Rousseau.

02:17.720 --> 02:22.840
Yeah. There's a... there's a lot of Rousseau
in Paris. Have you ever been to the Louvre?

02:22.920 --> 02:29.268
No, not yet. But it's on my list
- right after "fall in love" and "learn to drive".

02:29.360 --> 02:31.715
Well, you've got a great eye.

02:31.800 --> 02:35.110
Thanks. I think what you
do is pretty awesome, too.

02:35.200 --> 02:38.237
I mean, computers are
not for me, but I get it.

02:38.320 --> 02:41.073
Can I see what you're working on?

02:46.080 --> 02:49.117
- She's
amazing. - Mm-hm.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.634
Amy's been very brave this week.

02:51.720 --> 02:54.917
They're trying an
experimentaI virochemotherapy.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.991
And we're very optimistic.

02:57.080 --> 03:01.471
Since asbestos exposure is the primary
way people contract mesothelioma, how...?

03:03.760 --> 03:06.718
- How do you think Amy got it?
- We don't know, Dr Brennan.

03:06.800 --> 03:09.519
The first place we looked
after she was diagnosed

03:09.600 --> 03:13.434
was all her previous schools, the house we lived in
- nothing.

03:13.520 --> 03:15.875
Has there been a history of illness?

03:15.960 --> 03:19.589
Hardly. Apart from breaking
her leg snowboarding a year ago,

03:19.680 --> 03:21.989
I can't remember the
last time she was sick.

03:22.080 --> 03:25.117
- How bad was the break?
- Compound fracture, left tibia.

03:25.200 --> 03:29.876
I was boarding with some friends and
I... I hit a tree. Pretty dumb, huh?

03:29.960 --> 03:32.269
- And that required surgery?
- A bone graft.

03:32.360 --> 03:36.717
I hate to drag these lovely squints back
to the lab, but we have another case.

03:36.800 --> 03:40.349
- No, we don't. Could I see her
graft x-rays? - Sir, I apologise.

03:40.440 --> 03:42.829
Of course.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.757
If you think they'll tell us anything.

03:49.200 --> 03:54.320
<i>Whoa. Pardon the fromage reference, but
what's with the mouldy Gruy√®re in that leg?</i>

03:54.400 --> 03:57.278
The lighter colour is
evidence of demineralisation.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.954
I'm not the bone expert
here, but... yuck.

04:00.040 --> 04:03.555
- Osteoporosis.
- Basically, the bone has become porous.

04:03.640 --> 04:08.760
Something that happens with age. See if you
can isolate the grafted portion and enlarge it.

04:08.840 --> 04:12.594
- Amy's file states the donor was 25 years old.
- I don't buy it.

04:12.680 --> 04:16.753
- What about the ageing disease?
- This isn't a progerian skeleton.

04:16.839 --> 04:20.879
This bone is significantly less dense
than a person in their 20s, for sure.

04:20.959 --> 04:26.796
- How old do you think the donor really was?
- Judging from the reduction in bone mass...

04:26.880 --> 04:28.916
at least 60.

04:33.600 --> 04:38.276
- Doctor, did you perform Amy Cullen's graft?
- Yes. I just do the procedure, Ms Brennan.

04:38.360 --> 04:40.112
- Doctor Brennan.
- MD?

04:40.200 --> 04:43.875
- PhD.
- Well, those who can't do, do research.

04:43.960 --> 04:46.030
- OK.
- Booth.

04:46.120 --> 04:49.635
If you're just the mechanic, who's
responsible for all the parts?

04:49.720 --> 04:52.917
You'll have to check with the
transplant coordinator. Why?

04:53.000 --> 04:58.120
There are indications the bone graft you
implanted in Amy Cullen gave her cancer.

04:58.200 --> 05:01.272
Every graft we get has
been tested and irradiated.

05:01.360 --> 05:05.319
There's one way to know for sure.
Assuming remodelling hasn't occurred,

05:05.400 --> 05:09.837
do a transiliac crest core biopsy on the
donor bone, then we'll have age and pathology.

05:09.920 --> 05:12.912
And who's going to perform
that biopsy, Doctor?

05:13.000 --> 05:15.798
You are.

05:17.000 --> 05:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:24.720 --> 05:26.597
<i>That looks like it hurts.</i>

05:26.680 --> 05:32.471
They use locaI anaesthetic and make an
incision before inserting the needle.

05:32.560 --> 05:36.758
A tiny core of bone is taken
- a little more than a sixth of an inch in diameter,

05:36.840 --> 05:40.196
using a ratchetlike
device in the needle.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.672
So it hurts?

05:44.080 --> 05:46.275
Amy's a tough kid.

05:46.360 --> 05:48.430
She's doing great.

05:48.520 --> 05:51.318
<i>It's not Amy I'm worried about.</i>

05:52.840 --> 05:55.479
Let's go talk to the
coordinator who bought the graft.

05:55.560 --> 05:58.677
Unlike Amy, he gets to go home tonight.

06:02.760 --> 06:05.354
You're a popular man, Dr Ogden.

06:05.440 --> 06:09.353
When you find body parts that
save lives, you have no idea.

06:09.440 --> 06:12.477
I had one gentleman offer me
his cattle ranch in Montana.

06:12.560 --> 06:16.758
Well, people, they get desperate.
Did you take him up on it?

06:16.840 --> 06:18.876
That would be dishonest, Agent Booth.

06:18.960 --> 06:22.157
If anything, this office is
built on the goodness of people.

06:22.240 --> 06:26.358
- Cullen, Amy A. Bone graft number 4429.
- All right.

06:26.440 --> 06:29.796
According to my report,

06:29.880 --> 06:33.589
the bone that was donated was
harvested from a 25-year-old.

06:33.680 --> 06:36.990
- Can you give us the name?
- I can't provide that information.

06:37.080 --> 06:41.278
What about other recipients? Any other
patients get a part from the same body?

06:41.360 --> 06:44.432
When I said I couldn't tell
you, it's because we don't know.

06:44.520 --> 06:46.875
You'd have to ask the
tissue bank for that.

06:46.960 --> 06:52.796
Biotech Tissue Services. We've been using
them for a long time. Never had a problem.

06:52.880 --> 06:56.395
Amy Cullen has a problem. She's dying.

06:56.480 --> 07:01.713
Through no fault of this office. If we can be of
any further assistance, don't hesitate to call.

07:01.800 --> 07:05.429
Thanks for being so
sympathetic. We'll check into it.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.391
- New osteologic scans to input as requested.
- Hey, check this out.

07:14.480 --> 07:17.358
<i>- Monet?
- Amy Cullen.</i>

07:17.440 --> 07:20.716
- You're kidding.
- No. I ran it through the digitiser.

07:20.800 --> 07:25.590
She's a good kid. I wanted to show her
that computers don't have to be the enemy.

07:25.680 --> 07:29.468
Not bad for a certified
member of the geek squad.

07:29.560 --> 07:33.712
- I'll take that as a compliment.
- Well, you should.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.717
<i>This is a cross section
from Amy's bone graft.</i>

07:42.800 --> 07:45.951
Zack, what's the ratio of
primary to secondary osteons?

07:46.040 --> 07:50.079
I only see secondary. Exactly what
you'd expect to see in an older decedent.

07:50.160 --> 07:52.071
Any accompanying data?

07:52.680 --> 07:56.639
Well, I'm no expert, but I
think it supports as well.

07:56.720 --> 08:02.397
So based on this sample, it's clear that the
donor bone came from someone in their 60s.

08:02.480 --> 08:04.789
How do we know the bone gave Amy cancer?

08:04.880 --> 08:08.395
Because of this. Magnify.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.755
The graft is riddled with cancer.

08:10.840 --> 08:14.389
Cancer consistent with
morphology origin in the pleura.

08:14.480 --> 08:16.391
Most likely mesothelioma.

08:16.480 --> 08:20.837
Whoever this is had terminaI
cancer. And now so does Amy.

08:20.920 --> 08:23.992
She went in for a broken
leg and was poisoned.

08:24.080 --> 08:26.036
She never even had a chance.

08:26.120 --> 08:29.635
Someone knew that bone was infected
and they gave it to her anyway.

08:29.720 --> 08:31.790
This will kill Amy Cullen.

08:31.880 --> 08:34.599
Well, in that case, it's murder.

09:08.440 --> 09:10.795
Amy's cancer originated
in the bone graft.

09:10.880 --> 09:13.599
- The test confirms it.
- It was the operation?

09:13.680 --> 09:18.674
Not only was the bone contaminated by
malignancy, it was older than documented.

09:18.760 --> 09:22.594
- It was expired or something?
- No, sir. It came from a much older donor.

09:22.680 --> 09:24.796
Someone in their 60s.

09:27.360 --> 09:28.429
HospitaI error.

09:28.520 --> 09:32.638
Next we find where the graft came from
and how it slipped through the system.

09:32.720 --> 09:35.359
This is not FBI jurisdiction.

09:36.560 --> 09:38.437
It's a question ofjustice.

09:38.520 --> 09:42.638
Does this in any way change
my daughter's prognosis?

09:45.560 --> 09:47.755
No.

09:47.840 --> 09:50.035
So she's still gonna die of this cancer?

09:50.120 --> 09:53.317
Barring spontaneous remission,

09:53.400 --> 09:56.153
the likelihood is significant.

09:57.520 --> 10:01.069
The FBI's not my personaI police force.

10:01.160 --> 10:03.958
I appreciate what you've discovered.

10:04.040 --> 10:08.591
Call Charlie Hammond. Tell him what
happened. He'll continue the investigation.

10:08.680 --> 10:12.878
- My team can still...
- We'll notify CDC right away.

10:16.080 --> 10:19.709
So that's it? Whoever did this
to Amy Cullen just gets away.

10:19.800 --> 10:23.315
No. What we do now is find out a way
to make this a legitimate FBI case.

10:23.400 --> 10:26.119
If one graft is infected,
how many others are?

10:26.200 --> 10:30.637
I feeI like I'm on a seriaI-killer case
just waiting for another victim to surface.

10:30.720 --> 10:34.759
You're not far off. What if Biotech
makes a habit of selling diseased parts?

10:34.840 --> 10:38.992
It becomes FBI business if one tainted
graft is sold across state line.

10:39.080 --> 10:41.719
You can spit into four
states from where we are.

10:41.800 --> 10:44.268
- What?
- Not literally.

10:44.360 --> 10:48.990
- We'll find if this lab services other hospitals.
- See if they've killed anyone else.

10:49.080 --> 10:54.518
- Amy Cullen is not dead, Bones.
- I'm afraid there's a degree of inevitability.

10:55.720 --> 10:57.392
Sorry.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.911
It's pretty excellent, huh?

11:05.000 --> 11:07.912
- Is that
mine? - Uh-huh.

11:12.160 --> 11:14.390
How'd you do that?

11:14.480 --> 11:17.438
Most of the time I restore
and enhance old bones.

11:17.520 --> 11:20.717
So this is a lot more fun.

11:33.680 --> 11:36.114
It's hard, you know.

11:36.200 --> 11:41.354
One second I'm at schooI
and I'm gonna be an artist...

11:41.440 --> 11:43.954
and the next...

11:45.040 --> 11:47.679
My friends don't know what to say.

11:47.760 --> 11:50.354
My parents are scared.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.957
Things change, I guess.

11:56.040 --> 11:58.190
Yeah.

11:58.280 --> 12:01.158
Yeah, sometimes they do.

12:07.360 --> 12:10.079
Angela?

12:10.160 --> 12:12.674
Is the Louvre just unbelievable?

12:14.120 --> 12:20.355
- It's the most beautifuI place you'll ever see.
- Maybe you can tell me about it sometime.

12:20.440 --> 12:23.432
You'll go there yourself.

12:23.520 --> 12:26.273
I know you will.

12:36.120 --> 12:41.194
270. Here's Biotech. We get in
there, we'll sweat the head guy.

12:41.280 --> 12:45.034
Hello? F... BI.

12:45.120 --> 12:48.556
OK. So this is Biotech.

12:50.920 --> 12:54.959
- Sorry I couldn't be any more help.
- Thanks. I appreciate it.

12:55.040 --> 12:58.430
Building manager says Biotech
went belly up two years ago.

12:58.520 --> 13:00.795
- Couldn't pay their rent.
- Where'd they go?

13:00.880 --> 13:03.440
- He doesn't know.
- Two years ago?

13:03.520 --> 13:07.274
Exactly. Amy's graft was sold to
Washington GeneraI 12 months ago.

13:07.360 --> 13:11.194
If Biotech doesn't exist, who sold
a diseased bone to the hospitaI?

13:11.880 --> 13:13.871
Where is he?

13:13.960 --> 13:17.191
Dr Ogden had to oversee the
transport of a liver to Baltimore.

13:17.280 --> 13:20.795
A liver? Where'd he get this one
from? An alcoholic at a corner bar?

13:20.880 --> 13:23.269
We've dealt with Biotech for years.

13:23.360 --> 13:26.352
- There's no such company.
- That's not possible.

13:26.440 --> 13:28.431
I think Ogden is in on the whole thing.

13:28.520 --> 13:32.798
A biomedicaI payola. Buys third-rate
parts in exchange for a condo in St Croix.

13:32.880 --> 13:36.589
Dr Ogden's a very good man. I know
there are problems in his past, but...

13:36.680 --> 13:40.878
You mean there are skeletons in his closet?
I can't wait to see this guy's record.

13:40.960 --> 13:45.636
Alexandra, is there any way to tell if a
patient at Washington GeneraI received a graft

13:45.720 --> 13:47.790
from the same donor as Amy Cullen?

13:47.880 --> 13:53.591
Only the tissue lab knows for sure, but
after you left, I was curious, and...

13:53.680 --> 13:55.432
Please.

13:55.520 --> 14:00.071
It's already too late for Amy, but
it might not be for someone else.

14:03.600 --> 14:07.673
A woman named Kelly Demarco.
It was a car accident.

14:07.760 --> 14:12.276
This is Booth. I need a phone and address
for a Kelly Demarco in the Potomac area.

14:12.360 --> 14:16.876
Two grafts, same day as Amy.
Both grafts came from Biotech.

14:17.520 --> 14:20.239
When? Are you sure?

14:20.320 --> 14:22.231
- What is it?
- Thanks.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.356
Kelly Demarco, she's dead.

14:24.440 --> 14:26.271
Oh, my God.

14:26.360 --> 14:32.276
We need to know for sure if she had the
same kind of cancer. We have to exhume her.

14:37.400 --> 14:41.473
Kelly Demarco, age 32, dead
of lung cancer two months ago.

14:41.560 --> 14:46.475
Take a biopsy of this ulnograph and
compare it with the sample from Amy's leg.

14:46.560 --> 14:51.031
I spoke to Demarco's husband. She had
the accident, she had all the operations.

14:51.120 --> 14:55.432
She never smoked in her life, only to
die of lung cancer eight months ago.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.636
When your number's up, I guess, right?

14:57.720 --> 15:03.113
I never understood that saying. Numbers and
equations are quantitative and predictable.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.998
Everyone knows when a number's up.

15:06.080 --> 15:09.072
- How do you listen to this?
- I find intelligence soothing.

15:09.160 --> 15:11.993
It's amazing how quickly this spread.

15:12.080 --> 15:17.598
The graft went into her body. Within weeks,
the cancer cells metastasised to her lungs.

15:17.680 --> 15:22.435
- By then, the disease was unstoppable.
- Same bones, same donor, same disease.

15:22.520 --> 15:25.114
I got three agents
searching for Biotech.

15:25.200 --> 15:28.556
All we have is this emaiI address
assigned to a fictitious name.

15:28.640 --> 15:33.509
Let's just say that Ogden and this,
uh, fake tissue lab are in cahoots.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.989
How many other bones
could be from this donor?

15:36.080 --> 15:39.152
There are 206 bones in the
human body, Agent Booth.

15:39.240 --> 15:41.754
Of those, any number
of them are graftable.

15:41.840 --> 15:44.434
Hundreds of people
could still be out there

15:44.520 --> 15:47.353
with cancer time bombs in
them and not even realise it?

15:47.440 --> 15:50.079
We need to call every
hospitaI in the DC area.

15:50.160 --> 15:53.789
If they acquired Biotech
grafts at the same time as Amy,

15:53.880 --> 15:56.917
those recipients need to
be tracked down and tested.

15:57.000 --> 16:02.233
Fine. If you're right, then the Bureau can
officially designate this a seriaI killing.

16:02.320 --> 16:06.518
Agent Booth, the records
you've been waiting for.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.470
Oh, look at this. Alexandra
Combs, she wasn't Iying.

16:11.560 --> 16:14.154
Background check turns
up that Ogden was fired

16:14.240 --> 16:16.834
- from a private hospitaI in Denver.
- Reason?

16:16.920 --> 16:20.515
Accepting a bribe for bumping
someone up in the donor lists.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.830
This guy is dirty.

16:23.680 --> 16:26.990
Look, what I did in Denver was
wrong, but I did it for good reason.

16:27.080 --> 16:29.310
To line your pockets.

16:29.400 --> 16:32.073
The money went to keep a
struggling clinic afloat.

16:32.160 --> 16:35.152
Besides, it came from a
family that could afford it.

16:35.240 --> 16:38.038
So taking advantage of
wealthy people is OK?

16:38.120 --> 16:43.797
I'm not proud of that. Taking that bribe
doesn't mean I had anything to do with this.

16:43.880 --> 16:46.678
Tell us about your
relationship with Biotech.

16:46.760 --> 16:49.354
The same I have with every
company, a virtuaI one.

16:49.440 --> 16:52.318
Emails, online financiaI transactions.

16:52.400 --> 16:56.518
My assistant sends out a countrywide
search for the organ or bone that we need.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.318
They respond back and we bid.

16:58.400 --> 17:02.029
If we can reach an agreement, then
the part is transported for surgery.

17:02.120 --> 17:06.432
- And in Amy Cullen's case?
- Same protocoI. I bid, I bought, I received.

17:06.520 --> 17:11.036
No conversations. We're not required to
check out suppliers each time we order.

17:11.119 --> 17:13.509
I'll contact every bank
you do business with.

17:13.599 --> 17:17.593
If I find one deposit that's
suspicious, you know what? You're mine.

17:17.680 --> 17:22.231
I swear to you I'm not involved
in this. I haven't hurt anybody.

17:24.960 --> 17:28.669
<i>- Your work is awesome.
- Thanks.</i>

17:28.760 --> 17:31.797
There's so much going on,
you know, so much to feeI,

17:31.880 --> 17:35.156
I don't know if I'll ever be
able to do something like this.

17:35.240 --> 17:38.835
You will. Just give it time.

17:38.920 --> 17:42.071
Well, I may not have a lot of that.

17:42.160 --> 17:46.551
Your paintings and your
sculpture, they're alive, you know?

17:46.640 --> 17:50.792
It's like... you're showing me
how you felt when you painted them,

17:50.880 --> 17:53.189
what you've experienced.

17:53.280 --> 17:56.317
I can't paint what I don't know.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.709
You've been through
more than most people.

17:58.800 --> 18:01.473
You mean dying?

18:01.560 --> 18:03.471
It's not enough.

18:03.560 --> 18:06.279
I really think it's best
for you to stay positive.

18:06.360 --> 18:11.070
- Keep doing things, you mean?
- With your art? Yeah. Absolutely.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.956
What about guys?

18:14.040 --> 18:19.319
Ah, well. That totally goes
without saying. What's his name?

18:19.400 --> 18:22.870
Aaron. His family just
moved here from Maine.

18:22.960 --> 18:24.951
- Is he cute?
- He's so cute.

18:25.040 --> 18:29.670
- Did you ask him out?
- No. He asked me, but I don't know. I said no.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.955
Why?

18:38.000 --> 18:42.471
Look, you haven't asked my advice,
so I'm just gonna give it to you, OK?

18:42.560 --> 18:44.357
Just have fun.

18:44.440 --> 18:49.389
You know, every once in a while, you
might meet somebody who's worth it.

18:49.480 --> 18:51.914
What if he's not?

18:52.000 --> 18:55.879
Then you've got something
else to paint about.

19:03.280 --> 19:07.990
Bureau's canvassed every hospitaI in
the area. Four have been using Biotech.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.674
Three recipients have lung cancer.

19:10.760 --> 19:14.833
This one died of lung cancer three
months ago. I'm checking on a buriaI site.

19:14.920 --> 19:18.595
That makes 13, including
Amy and the Demarco woman.

19:18.680 --> 19:22.992
- Probably all from the same donor.
- We're waiting on Bethesda NavaI HospitaI.

19:23.080 --> 19:26.629
- Can you ID these people?
- Got names and addresses on all of them.

19:26.720 --> 19:31.714
I've already contacted Washington GeneraI
to set up a biopsy testing facility.

19:31.800 --> 19:36.476
Man. How did one dead
guy do so much damage?

19:36.560 --> 19:39.233
- That's a good idea.
- What idea?

19:39.320 --> 19:43.677
Identify the donor and we might be able
to find out how Biotech got his bones.

19:43.760 --> 19:49.153
Got it. Second decedent is Ronald Lupo.
I found him at a cemetery in Lynchburg.

19:49.240 --> 19:50.593
- Virginia?
- Yeah. Why?

19:50.680 --> 19:54.992
This fraud just crossed state lines and
became a legitimate case for the FBI.

19:55.080 --> 19:59.039
Looks like I don't have to
use my sick days any more, huh?

20:02.080 --> 20:03.479
How many?

20:03.560 --> 20:05.232
- Sick or dead?
- Dead.

20:05.320 --> 20:09.996
Two... that we know of, but that
makes it a multiple-homicide case.

20:10.080 --> 20:13.993
Since it's not isolated and the
recipients are in multiple states...

20:14.080 --> 20:18.153
- This falls under FBI jurisdiction.
- Yes, sir.

20:18.240 --> 20:21.038
I should kick your ass.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.439
Yeah.

20:23.960 --> 20:27.873
What'd you do? Take sick
time to work on this?

20:27.960 --> 20:30.190
Yeah. Migraine.

20:33.720 --> 20:35.711
Thanks, Booth.

20:37.320 --> 20:40.676
Catch the son of a bitch
that did this to my daughter.

20:40.760 --> 20:43.354
That's absolutely my intention, sir.

21:36.560 --> 21:37.629
Results?

21:37.720 --> 21:40.518
There are three other
early signs of cancer cells.

21:40.600 --> 21:46.869
Aggressive chemo and radiation
treatments should be able to slow it down.

21:46.960 --> 21:49.952
Admiring your handiwork, Doctor?

21:52.720 --> 21:54.676
I'm sorry.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.956
- Amy.
- Let me.

21:58.040 --> 21:59.871
Easy.

22:00.480 --> 22:02.675
Hey.

22:02.760 --> 22:04.716
You all right?

22:04.800 --> 22:07.633
Did these people get bones
from the same donor I did?

22:07.720 --> 22:09.358
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

22:09.440 --> 22:12.398
- Do they all have cancer?
- No, not all of them.

22:12.480 --> 22:16.359
But the sooner the ones who
are infected know, the better.

22:16.440 --> 22:20.718
Who would do that? If they knew they were
sick, why make other people sick, too?

22:20.800 --> 22:26.318
I don't know. It's terrible. But
that's what we're trying to figure out.

22:26.400 --> 22:29.949
So, if you take the bad grafts out,

22:30.040 --> 22:32.110
will they be OK?

22:32.200 --> 22:37.718
- Some of them.
- But... not me.

22:40.200 --> 22:42.191
No.

22:43.560 --> 22:46.438
- I want this out of me.
- You're not strong enough.

22:46.520 --> 22:50.069
- Get them to take it out.
- Amy, you have to understand.

22:50.160 --> 22:53.311
- All of these people...
- I don't care.

22:54.960 --> 22:57.235
You're saving their lives.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.390
We've traced these grafts to
the donor and still know nothing.

23:13.480 --> 23:18.713
Not exactly nothing. Zack, look at the
slope of the sciatic notch in the pelvis.

23:18.800 --> 23:23.430
- And the nonelevated auricular surface.
- He was definitely male.

23:23.520 --> 23:26.956
The osteon count in the femoraI
joint confirms the donor was over 60.

23:27.040 --> 23:30.794
It's a solid start,
but we need a lot more.

23:30.880 --> 23:35.795
Osteophytosis with narrowing
of intervertebraI spaces

23:35.880 --> 23:38.872
indicates consistent heavy lifting.

23:38.960 --> 23:43.715
- Construction worker?
- It's hard to say. Definitely a burly type.

23:43.800 --> 23:46.678
If we keep guessing about
what he was like on the inside,

23:46.760 --> 23:51.629
then Angela can hypothesise about
his appearance, size, weight.

23:51.720 --> 23:53.517
I'm on it.

23:55.120 --> 23:57.588
I scanned in the x-rays
of the graft recipients

23:57.680 --> 24:00.240
as well as the pieces
from the exhumed bodies.

24:00.320 --> 24:02.629
OK. Now what? Connect the dots?

24:02.720 --> 24:07.840
- More like connect the body parts.
- I think of it as sculpting from the inside out.

24:07.920 --> 24:12.118
The more I know about our donor, the
better I can guess what he looked like.

24:12.200 --> 24:17.320
The fragments originated from nine sites on
the donor's body. If we connect the grafts...

24:18.360 --> 24:22.990
Now input all of the anatomicaI
factors and core anomalies.

24:24.760 --> 24:28.230
<i>Guys, meet donor X.</i>

24:28.320 --> 24:31.357
The man who caused all this pain.

24:31.440 --> 24:34.079
<i>So that's our seriaI killer.</i>

24:34.160 --> 24:37.630
He had no idea how much damage
he'd cause. Can we track him down?

24:37.720 --> 24:40.109
- Hodgins?
- Maybe. With LIBS.

24:40.200 --> 24:43.272
- Who's Libs? - Laser-induced
breakdown spectroscopy.

24:43.360 --> 24:47.148
- It'll give us an elementaI analysis.
- Angela told us what he looked like.

24:47.240 --> 24:49.629
Now Hodgins can tell us where he lived.

24:49.720 --> 24:52.075
Well, we'll find him.

24:52.960 --> 24:55.918
We have to.

25:11.680 --> 25:15.992
Strontium isotope levels suggest donor X
lived the last 20 years on the East Coast.

25:16.080 --> 25:19.038
Extremely low levels of
fluoride in the cancellous bone.

25:19.120 --> 25:24.399
UnusuaI. Most tap water is fluoridated,
except for parts of the Appalachian Mountains.

25:24.480 --> 25:28.075
A few of the Hatfields and
McCoys still have no teeth.

25:28.160 --> 25:31.869
So he's from Tennessee, West
Virginia, or North Carolina.

25:31.960 --> 25:34.235
Oh, great. That narrows it down.

25:34.320 --> 25:38.598
High leveI of C8. That's
a key ingredient of Teflon.

25:38.680 --> 25:42.070
There's a Teflon plant in
Parkersburg, West Virginia.

25:42.160 --> 25:45.596
And minuscule traces
of nuclear subparticles.

25:45.680 --> 25:48.956
Wasn't there a problem at
Brant's Cliff power facility?

25:49.040 --> 25:53.511
Just a little one. Employees were growing
a second head. Can you say cover-up?

25:53.600 --> 25:56.319
- OK, where's Brant's Cliff?
- West Virginia also.

25:56.400 --> 25:59.517
OK, fine. So we're trying to
ID a guy who's 65 years of age,

25:59.600 --> 26:05.232
roughly 200 pounds, lives in West Virginia,
died of lung cancer within the last year.

26:08.800 --> 26:12.395
There are three West Virginia
donors we could be talking about.

26:12.480 --> 26:15.199
<i>Lester Blake, Blair Simmons...</i>

26:15.280 --> 26:18.829
Hey, lady! Watch where you're driving!

26:18.920 --> 26:21.753
I'd rather not be a donor myself.

26:21.840 --> 26:26.755
Blair Simmons out of Dailey and
William Hastings out of Beards Fork.

26:26.840 --> 26:29.434
All three men died of
mesothelioma last August.

26:29.520 --> 26:31.829
We'll be in Beards Fork
within about an hour.

26:31.920 --> 26:35.799
- Are Zack and Hodgins are on the other two?
- This is Brennan.

26:35.880 --> 26:39.509
I'm at Lester Blake's exhumation.
I've examined the remains.

26:40.520 --> 26:41.999
This is Booth.

26:42.080 --> 26:44.355
- Blair Simmons isn't dead.
- What?

26:44.440 --> 26:47.955
- He's frozen in a cryogenics lab.
- What do you mean, frozen?

26:48.040 --> 26:50.759
Like a supermarket turkey.
Not a scratch on him.

26:50.840 --> 26:53.718
And he's wedged between
Walt Disney and Ted Williams.

26:53.800 --> 26:57.759
No sign of tampering. His casket
hasn't been opened since his buriaI.

26:57.840 --> 27:02.118
- So if Blake isn't our donor...
- So if Simmons isn't our donor...

27:02.200 --> 27:05.192
Mrs Hastings, what did your
husband do for a living?

27:05.280 --> 27:11.230
This and that. Bill worked in construction for
a time, did the night shift at Brant's Cliff.

27:11.320 --> 27:14.278
- Opened a roofing business a few years back.
- Roofing?

27:14.360 --> 27:19.036
- Shingling and fireproofing and such.
- So he handled asbestos?

27:19.120 --> 27:22.829
Doctors say that's what finally got
him. But why are y'all so curious?

27:22.920 --> 27:28.438
He did time for petty theft and fraud. You
lost your home, cars. He left you with nothing.

27:28.520 --> 27:32.229
Ah, Bill Hastings was an old fooI
who deserved what came to him.

27:32.320 --> 27:36.279
You needed money. Did anyone ask you
about selling his parts after he died?

27:36.360 --> 27:39.318
Pardon? I'm afraid I don't follow.

27:40.240 --> 27:45.189
Well, his family has a cemetery plot
in Kincaid, yet you cremated him.

27:45.280 --> 27:47.999
Are you hiding something?

27:51.040 --> 27:54.271
The guy at the funeraI
home said it was cheaper.

27:54.360 --> 27:58.353
- We couldn't afford a proper buriaI.
- What funeraI home?

27:58.440 --> 28:01.796
- It was called Martin, I think.
- Where are the ashes?

28:01.880 --> 28:04.474
- Out back in the yard.
- Do you mind if we take a sample?

28:04.560 --> 28:08.758
I sure as hell do. I don't like
what y'all are accusing me of.

28:08.840 --> 28:12.719
- We'll just come back with a warrant.
- You'd better bring you some dogs.

28:12.800 --> 28:16.395
Bring those trigger-happy agents
too. This conversation is over.

28:16.480 --> 28:18.994
Come on, Bones. Let's
go. Have a nice day.

28:23.720 --> 28:27.110
She insists he wasn't the donor.
The evidence is overwhelming.

28:27.200 --> 28:30.670
If I had a soiI sample, there
are bone fragments still intact

28:30.760 --> 28:32.716
that we can identify him with.

28:32.800 --> 28:37.430
- Was there an insurance policy in place?
- None. More reasons to sell the illegaI grafts.

28:37.520 --> 28:40.512
But the funeraI home had
to be in cahoots with her.

28:40.600 --> 28:43.831
So all we have to do is connect
the widow to the funeraI home.

28:43.920 --> 28:46.992
- Then the home to Biotech.
- Mr Cullen.

28:47.080 --> 28:49.469
We need to speak to
you and Amy's mother.

28:49.560 --> 28:52.950
We'll go. Come on, Bones.

29:06.200 --> 29:10.239
She's telling them the
treatment didn't work.

29:10.320 --> 29:12.629
There's nothing else they can do.

29:16.480 --> 29:18.675
I hate seeing them so sad.

29:48.920 --> 29:52.356
Bones. Bones, I know that you
find dead people intriguing,

29:52.440 --> 29:55.557
butjust try to put on your sad face.

30:04.360 --> 30:07.432
- I'm in the middle of a service.
- This'll only take a minute.

30:07.520 --> 30:10.159
Mr... Jessup, he ain't going nowhere.

30:10.240 --> 30:13.118
- What is this about, exactly?
- William Hastings.

30:13.200 --> 30:17.034
- Is he someone you've lost?
- More like somebody we found.

30:17.120 --> 30:19.350
He passed away a year ago
- you cremated him,

30:19.440 --> 30:23.353
but somehow his bones were illegally
harvested prior to the procedure.

30:23.440 --> 30:25.271
- Not here.
- What do you mean?

30:25.360 --> 30:28.193
This is my mortuary. I've
been in business a decade.

30:28.280 --> 30:32.671
I have no recollection
whatsoever of Mr Hastings.

30:32.760 --> 30:35.399
His wife mentioned
this place specifically.

30:35.480 --> 30:39.234
- The bereaved are often confused.
- In this case, I don't think so.

30:39.320 --> 30:44.872
<i>- We don't think so.
- Excuse me. I have mourners waiting.</i>

30:44.960 --> 30:48.236
Maybe you can double-check
your records and get back to me.

30:48.320 --> 30:54.634
I would, but my records are impeccable.
There's nothing to double-check.

30:54.720 --> 30:57.996
- That was quick.
- I need to get those ashes from her yard.

30:58.080 --> 30:59.798
I'll get the warrant.

30:59.880 --> 31:02.633
Don't forget the dogs
and the gun-toting agents.

31:02.720 --> 31:04.870
Trust me, I won't forget that.

31:09.480 --> 31:11.152
I looked it up on the internet.

31:11.240 --> 31:14.949
You can get $10,000 for grafts
on the black market these days.

31:15.040 --> 31:19.238
- Ten grand? Mine are worth more than that.
- What makes you so speciaI?

31:19.320 --> 31:21.788
Three glasses of milk a
day, I work out, I eat right.

31:21.880 --> 31:25.668
X
- ray shows a high concentration of calcium carbonate.

31:25.760 --> 31:31.835
That's a revelation. Is there anything we
can link to William Hastings' medicaI records?

31:31.920 --> 31:35.629
The cremains are consistent
to those of William Hastings.

31:35.720 --> 31:39.633
I keep asking, if the widow is guilty,
why keep the remains so close to home?

31:39.720 --> 31:42.757
- What if she didn't know about it?
- She hated the guy.

31:42.840 --> 31:46.549
My guess is she has 10 G's stuffed
in her mattress back in trailerville.

31:46.640 --> 31:50.474
No. I mean it. There are no
unusuaI bank records, no deposits.

31:50.560 --> 31:53.791
What if they took the grafts
and she was none the wiser?

31:53.880 --> 31:55.757
Man, is she gonna be pissed.

31:55.840 --> 32:00.914
If it's not the widow Hastings, I'm doubling
down on the mortician. Everyone in? You in?

32:11.440 --> 32:13.715
Thank you. Oh, jeez.

32:13.800 --> 32:16.473
This body's being
prepped. What do you want?

32:16.560 --> 32:19.711
We want to know where you
harvested Mr Hastings' body.

32:19.800 --> 32:23.998
- I told you I don't know who Hastings is.
- Well, we think you're Iying.

32:24.080 --> 32:27.072
We think you're selling
bone grafts illegally.

32:27.160 --> 32:30.038
Your accusations are
outlandish. Call my lawyer.

32:30.120 --> 32:34.511
Yeah? Well, we have a warrant
here to look around a little.

32:37.880 --> 32:40.348
What's this place?

32:40.440 --> 32:45.468
- Casket showroom. They're having a sale.
- It looks like a sick department store.

32:45.560 --> 32:48.632
Nobody would be cutting anybody
up in this place. Let's go.

32:48.720 --> 32:50.995
Whoa. Wait.

32:51.080 --> 32:55.119
- Over there.
- What? It's a water line. What's the big deaI?

32:55.200 --> 32:58.158
<i>The floor slopes toward
the centre of the room.</i>

32:58.240 --> 33:04.475
This wasn't always used for a showroom.
I wonder what's under the carpet.

33:04.560 --> 33:07.233
If body work was done in here,

33:07.320 --> 33:10.437
they'd need a drain.

33:10.520 --> 33:13.910
- You're kidding me. It's a drain?
- This is our sales office.

33:14.000 --> 33:18.755
There is nothing in here you need to see.
The only thing in this room is caskets.

33:18.840 --> 33:22.594
- I'm not so sure about that.
- No... You are making a mistake.

33:22.680 --> 33:24.671
Am I?

33:25.560 --> 33:28.393
- She's ruining my merchandise.
- How much is that one?

33:28.480 --> 33:30.994
- $7,000.
- Bones, watch the scuff marks.

33:31.080 --> 33:33.958
Mr Martin, this room is
designed to be washed clean.

33:34.040 --> 33:38.318
You've got drains in the floor. I think
this is where you did the bone harvesting.

33:38.400 --> 33:41.073
You thought we'd come back
so you moved everything.

33:41.160 --> 33:43.594
That's absurd. I did no such thing.

33:43.680 --> 33:46.353
You're an excellent house cleaner,

33:46.440 --> 33:51.594
but in the carpeting and tidying
up, you forgot about one thing.

33:55.360 --> 33:59.911
Bone dust. You forgot
about airborne particles.

34:02.800 --> 34:04.836
Today, Zack. I need something today.

34:04.920 --> 34:09.391
- Hey, don't harass my assistant.
- That's right. That's ourjob.

34:09.480 --> 34:14.759
I sifted dust particles then separated
the largest pieces to compare the osteons.

34:14.840 --> 34:19.914
- The particles came from human remains.
- William Hastings' remains?

34:20.000 --> 34:24.152
I am comparing particles to the
biopsy we excised from Kelly Demarco.

34:24.239 --> 34:26.036
Compare.

34:31.440 --> 34:33.590
So? Is it him?

34:34.120 --> 34:37.157
It's him. But... here's the kickster.

34:37.239 --> 34:39.594
"Kicker", Bones. "Here's the kicker. "

34:39.679 --> 34:43.911
- There's bone dust from seven other bodies.
- Seven?

34:44.000 --> 34:47.594
Cutting periosteum for grafting
purposes takes medicaI training.

34:47.679 --> 34:53.197
- These bone grafts are expertly harvested.
- So we're looking for someone with training.

34:53.280 --> 34:56.955
Martin is a mortician, not a doctor.
Let's say he's running a chop shop.

34:57.040 --> 35:00.396
Let's say he was selling
illegaI parts to tissue labs.

35:00.480 --> 35:05.998
- Who was actually doing the cutting?
- Who was selling to hospitals as Biotech?

35:09.840 --> 35:13.913
How much money have you made over
the years doing this, Nick? Hm?

35:14.000 --> 35:18.232
- Tens? Hundreds of thousands of dollars.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

35:18.320 --> 35:21.437
William Hastings had an
aggressive form of cancer.

35:21.520 --> 35:24.478
You made some pocket
change off his grafts.

35:24.560 --> 35:28.519
Now people are sick. Two died. You're
looking at multiple counts of murder.

35:28.600 --> 35:31.512
- I didn't kill anybody.
- No, you didn't kill anybody.

35:31.600 --> 35:35.229
- They were dead. You were recycling.
- I didn't do anything wrong.

35:35.320 --> 35:37.276
- Do you have doctor training?
- No.

35:37.360 --> 35:40.158
- Spend any time in the service as a medic?
- No.

35:40.240 --> 35:44.392
Then who did the cutting of the grafts,
huh? Somebody knew what they were doing.

35:44.480 --> 35:46.869
Records show that
around Hastings' death,

35:46.960 --> 35:49.952
you received dozens of
calls from disposable cells.

35:50.040 --> 35:54.511
Four different ones, huh?
What do you make of that?

35:54.600 --> 35:56.511
- I don't recall this.
- You know what?

35:56.600 --> 36:02.675
The dust we got from your showroom
matched Hastings and seven other bodies.

36:02.760 --> 36:05.558
- Who do you work with?
- I don't know what you mean.

36:05.640 --> 36:11.749
You do. You and your partners knew that
the bones were cancerous and you didn't...

36:11.840 --> 36:14.718
Who was it, huh? Who the
hell did this to my daughter?

36:14.800 --> 36:18.315
Sir! Sir! I got him.
I got him, sir. Please.

36:19.440 --> 36:23.672
Bones, how long is it
gonna take you to...? Bones!

36:31.960 --> 36:34.918
Oh, Dr Brennan. You startled me.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.195
- Mind if I come in?
- Not at all.

36:37.280 --> 36:39.430
I was trying to keep things organised.

36:39.520 --> 36:42.910
What we do is so important, we
can't risk making any mistakes.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.197
Miss Combs, tell me, what
do you use these phones for?

36:46.280 --> 36:49.431
Recipients. We never know when
a donor organ will come in,

36:49.520 --> 36:52.717
so it's imperative that they
can be reached at all times.

36:52.800 --> 36:55.792
Ever use one yourself?

36:55.880 --> 36:59.190
- What can I do for you?
- Did you always want to work in a hospitaI?

36:59.280 --> 37:03.831
I mean, it's incredibly rewarding, I
know, but you ever want to study medicine?

37:03.920 --> 37:05.876
I did at one time, yes.

37:05.960 --> 37:08.872
How do you feeI? Have
you been coughing at all?

37:08.960 --> 37:13.112
- Do you feeI a tightness in your chest?
- I feeI fine, actually.

37:13.200 --> 37:15.668
How often does Dr Ogden
write prescriptions?

37:15.760 --> 37:18.194
Rarely. As coordinator,
he doesn't practise.

37:18.280 --> 37:23.274
Yet the pharmacy told the FBI he wrote you
a script for an expectorant for a cough.

37:23.360 --> 37:29.390
- There must be some mistake. He'd never...
- You wrote that yourself, didn't you?

37:29.480 --> 37:33.234
I know what you've been doing with Martin
- to Hastings and the others.

37:33.320 --> 37:38.917
If you'd finished medicaI schooI, you'd
know. Bone dust is very dangerous if inhaled.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.037
When you were taking those
grafts, I doubt you wore a mask.

37:42.120 --> 37:44.998
You're sick, Miss Combs, and I...

37:45.080 --> 37:49.198
I don'tjust mean in a
mentally disturbed way.

37:50.200 --> 37:52.919
- You can't prove anything.
- We're in a hospitaI.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.629
Why don't we go get a
chest x-ray and find out?

37:56.720 --> 38:01.999
- I'd like to read you your rights.
- Alexandra, what's going on?

38:03.200 --> 38:05.589
So the assistant
fancied herself a doctor?

38:05.680 --> 38:10.879
Not a doctor exactly, but qualified enough
to extricate bone grafts from a cadaver.

38:10.960 --> 38:15.476
- And what about Biotech Tissue Labs?
- Once it was a legitimate company.

38:15.560 --> 38:21.908
Combs kept it alive on the web and funnelled
the money into her own bank account.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.117
- So where does that leave Amy?
- Same as where she started.

38:25.200 --> 38:28.909
Just with answers, that's all.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.878
Well, that is perfect.

38:31.960 --> 38:34.758
- Angela.
- That's OK. I got it.

38:40.760 --> 38:42.716
Hey.

38:42.920 --> 38:44.035
Hey.

38:44.120 --> 38:47.874
- You all right?
- Yeah.

38:48.880 --> 38:51.713
No. No, I'm not.

38:52.800 --> 38:55.712
Look, we can solve
100-year-old crimes.

38:55.800 --> 38:58.997
We can... we can track
down seriaI killers

38:59.080 --> 39:03.995
and identify people when nothing
is left of them but sludge.

39:04.080 --> 39:08.232
So, why can't we help
a 15-year-old girI?

39:09.640 --> 39:12.950
All she wants to do is fall in love...

39:14.040 --> 39:16.395
and visit the Louvre.

39:18.120 --> 39:19.997
You can do that.

39:20.080 --> 39:21.798
What do you mean?

39:21.880 --> 39:26.271
You made a whole guy out
of bone chips and lights.

39:26.360 --> 39:29.079
You can create the Louvre.

39:33.000 --> 39:37.516
What about love? What do
you have to say about love?

39:37.600 --> 39:40.592
It's overrated.

39:41.160 --> 39:43.116
Most of the time.

39:57.120 --> 39:59.315
OK.

39:59.400 --> 40:01.755
Now, tell me what you see.

40:08.040 --> 40:10.190
<i>Oh, wow! No way.</i>

40:10.280 --> 40:13.989
Angela, this is unbelievable.

40:17.480 --> 40:20.870
- Welcome to the Louvre.
- I'm really there.

40:20.960 --> 40:24.191
- That's amazing.
- Is this your doing, Dr Brennan?

40:24.280 --> 40:27.397
No, sir. It's all Ms Montenegro.

40:27.480 --> 40:29.835
Thank you, Angela.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.956
You're welcome.

40:32.040 --> 40:34.554
So what do you think?

40:37.160 --> 40:41.278
I think it's like heaven.
I don't know what to say.

40:41.720 --> 40:44.598
Don't say anything. You don't have to.
