00:03.000 --> 00:04.500
(Ryan) Previously, on Mech-X4...

00:04.583 --> 00:07.709
What's the point of blowing up your school
if they send you to a different one?

00:07.792 --> 00:09.333
You're wearing a varsity jacket,

00:09.417 --> 00:11.000
-you're not varsity here.
-Yet.

00:11.083 --> 00:13.417
Let's not make this
harder than it has to be. Grey?

00:13.500 --> 00:14.625
Back from the dead.

00:19.041 --> 00:21.625
(roars)

00:29.583 --> 00:30.625
No!

00:32.458 --> 00:34.542
All right, you heartless monster.

00:40.542 --> 00:42.166
I believe that belongs to you.

00:47.917 --> 00:51.583
(computer) All systems failing!
Eject! Eject!

00:59.709 --> 01:01.583
(groaning)

01:07.250 --> 01:08.875
(phone dials)

01:08.959 --> 01:11.417
-Sir! I thought you were dead.
-Well, Morris,

01:11.500 --> 01:13.375
since everybody knows
I'm behind the monsters,

01:13.458 --> 01:15.667
good. Listen, you need to hide.

01:15.750 --> 01:18.166
I need to get out of Bay City before--

01:18.834 --> 01:19.750
Grey?

01:19.834 --> 01:21.166
Surprise.

01:25.083 --> 01:26.291
(roaring)

01:26.375 --> 01:28.375
Unexpected! Terrifying!

01:28.458 --> 01:29.792
Okay, easy, easy.

01:29.875 --> 01:32.041
-(screams)
-(roars)

01:49.125 --> 01:50.750
(Grey) Is it ready?

01:51.458 --> 01:54.208
Considering you can claw my head off,

01:54.291 --> 01:55.250
yeah, it's ready.

01:56.500 --> 01:59.583
Technically, it's now the same gel
you fell into,

01:59.667 --> 02:02.125
which we know can give you monster powers.

02:02.208 --> 02:05.542
-Without damaging human DNA?
-Theoretically.

02:06.667 --> 02:10.500
So, what's up? You need a tune up?
A power boost? A little monster smoothie?

02:10.583 --> 02:13.417
-I mean, why are you--
-(pounds table)

02:13.500 --> 02:15.333
You said, "Theoretically."

02:15.417 --> 02:18.250
Yeah, I mean, it's untested.

02:18.333 --> 02:20.667
If I'm wrong, it could--
you know, it could kill you

02:20.750 --> 02:23.625
or-- or make you grow a second face,

02:23.709 --> 02:25.834
which would be weird at first, but maybe,

02:25.917 --> 02:27.667
in the long run, could be better.

02:27.750 --> 02:29.709
Then we need to test it...

02:32.625 --> 02:34.291
(beeping)

02:34.375 --> 02:38.792
...on people I don't mind seeing hurt.

02:40.083 --> 02:41.792
(theme music playing)

03:16.583 --> 03:18.250
What do you mean, you're not coming?

03:18.333 --> 03:20.166
(Ryan on phone)
Dude, Grey's still out there!

03:20.250 --> 03:23.375
I know, but we've been on patrol
every day this week, and nothing.

03:23.458 --> 03:24.709
Now, if she shows her face,

03:24.792 --> 03:27.083
or her claws, we'll take her down,

03:27.166 --> 03:30.041
but there's a spot open on varsity
and I'm gonna take it.

03:30.125 --> 03:32.333
I'm really sorry about your leg, man.

03:33.333 --> 03:35.291
Not really sorry.

03:35.375 --> 03:36.709
(whistle blows)

03:36.792 --> 03:38.208
Take a seat, guys.

03:38.291 --> 03:40.959
All right, first round
of tryouts are starting. Got to go.

03:41.041 --> 03:42.959
(kids shouting)

03:43.041 --> 03:45.208
(kids) Oh!

03:50.834 --> 03:52.834
Yeah! Yeah!

03:56.917 --> 03:58.583
(whistle blows)

03:58.667 --> 04:00.792
You and you, out.

04:00.875 --> 04:03.375
Tomorrow morning, you two, one-on-one.

04:03.458 --> 04:05.208
Whoever wins makes the team.

04:08.208 --> 04:11.000
I need him to focus on Grey,
not some stupid tryout.

04:11.083 --> 04:12.917
It's not stupid to him.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.792
Look, we all have our thing.

04:14.875 --> 04:17.333
You're the technopath, I'm the brain,

04:17.417 --> 04:19.041
and Spyder is...

04:19.959 --> 04:21.333
is...

04:22.500 --> 04:24.458
Awesome. Weirdly flexible.

04:25.291 --> 04:26.166
Can hear dog whistles?

04:26.250 --> 04:27.917
-And Mark's a jock.
-Right.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.875
We're gonna-- We're gonna come
back to my thing, though, right?

04:32.000 --> 04:34.417
-(Harris) Uh...
-(Ryan) For sure...

04:34.500 --> 04:36.542
Dude, don't you think
it's been hard on him,

04:36.625 --> 04:38.625
being at a new school and, you know,

04:38.709 --> 04:40.125
not being Mark Walker?

04:40.208 --> 04:41.458
I guess.

04:41.542 --> 04:44.000
Varsity is a part of his identity.

04:44.083 --> 04:46.583
Just like how the information
on this data core

04:46.667 --> 04:47.959
is a part of yours.

04:48.041 --> 04:50.500
How is the data core going, anyway?

04:50.583 --> 04:53.208
Don't you think if he got the info
he'd be gloating by now?

04:53.291 --> 04:54.583
I don't gloat.

04:54.667 --> 04:56.375
-"Dang, son!"
-"Science!"

04:56.417 --> 04:57.959
(both) "Check it, y'all!"

04:58.041 --> 05:00.291
Okay... I gloat a little,

05:00.375 --> 05:02.166
but not today.

05:02.250 --> 05:04.750
Harper encrypted this
in a way I can't work around.

05:04.834 --> 05:06.500
And that I can't crack with my powers.

05:06.583 --> 05:09.792
So... I need better decryption software,

05:09.875 --> 05:11.375
and I can get it.

05:11.458 --> 05:13.041
All I need is a little bit more time.

05:13.125 --> 05:16.083
And I'll use that time
to help Mark with the tryout.

05:18.875 --> 05:21.917
Does anyone know if this thing
can 3D-print sneakers?

05:22.667 --> 05:23.625
(whistle blows)

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
(cheering)

05:32.083 --> 05:33.709
Man, he's good.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.333
Yeah, thanks.

05:35.417 --> 05:37.959
If this is about me not spending
every waking minute in the robot--

05:38.041 --> 05:40.542
Nah, man. I'm here to support.

05:45.625 --> 05:46.667
Dude!

05:51.000 --> 05:52.542
These are awesome.

05:52.625 --> 05:53.750
(whistle blows)

05:53.834 --> 05:55.333
They feel great.

05:55.417 --> 05:56.667
Go kick butt at your tryout.

06:06.959 --> 06:08.333
Game on!

06:17.125 --> 06:18.959
(cheering)

06:25.500 --> 06:27.375
(loud cheering)

06:29.208 --> 06:31.667
-That's amazing!
-Oh, you think that's amazing?

06:33.792 --> 06:35.083
Watch this.

06:45.083 --> 06:47.125
-(cheering)
-Did you put gravity pucks in his shoes?

06:47.208 --> 06:49.959
-That's cheating!
-I'm trying to help my brother.

06:56.458 --> 06:58.917
I'm not mad, I'm proud.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.875
You wanna know the secret
cheater handshake?

07:00.959 --> 07:02.667
No.

07:02.750 --> 07:04.583
He's gonna kill you
when he finds out, right?

07:04.667 --> 07:07.166
We both know Mark deserves
to be on the team.

07:07.250 --> 07:09.667
Plus, how is he gonna find out?

07:11.875 --> 07:13.500
(boy) Whoa!

07:15.959 --> 07:18.041
How could he not know?

07:18.125 --> 07:20.417
Man, I knew I was awesome,
but that awesome?

07:21.458 --> 07:23.333
-(whistle tweets)
-Okay.

07:23.417 --> 07:24.959
You got moves, Walker!

07:25.041 --> 07:29.458
-Welcome to the team.
-Go Fighting Bees!

07:30.500 --> 07:32.291
Uh, the Mighty Beavers?

07:35.375 --> 07:37.250
It's the Badgers.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.250
Go Mighty Badgers!

07:44.125 --> 07:47.667
(Principal on intercom) Remember,
Badgers, today is Red Velvet Cupcake Day.

07:51.875 --> 07:53.291
Oh.

08:02.250 --> 08:03.500
(clattering)

08:20.583 --> 08:21.834
Mmm.

08:31.667 --> 08:33.667
-(school bell rings)
-Ah, there he is!

08:33.750 --> 08:35.291
He's the newest, the awesomest,

08:35.375 --> 08:37.542
member of Badger varsity.

08:37.625 --> 08:39.750
Mark! Mark! Mark! Mark!

08:41.166 --> 08:43.125
It'll catch on, I promise.

08:43.208 --> 08:45.375
Yo, Walker! Over here!

08:45.458 --> 08:48.166
If you're with us, you're with us.

08:48.834 --> 08:50.875
Just go to them.

08:50.959 --> 08:53.041
I'm gonna drown my sorrow in a cupcake.

08:56.208 --> 08:57.250
Hey...

08:57.333 --> 08:59.333
it meant a lot that you
supported me today.

08:59.417 --> 09:00.709
You know, after practice,

09:00.792 --> 09:03.333
we're gonna get back to looking for Grey.

09:03.417 --> 09:06.625
Hey, Mark? Can I have
one of my gravity pucks back?

09:06.709 --> 09:09.291
-Shh!
-Wait, what?

09:13.250 --> 09:14.750
Yup.

09:16.458 --> 09:18.333
Ha-ha! Okay, cool. Thanks!

09:18.417 --> 09:21.166
Oh, and by the way,
congratulations on making varsity.

09:21.250 --> 09:24.000
Yeah, with no help at all,
nothing suspicious.

09:24.083 --> 09:25.208
I have to leave now.

09:25.291 --> 09:26.750
These shoes were teched up?

09:27.875 --> 09:30.208
Hallway. Now.

09:31.041 --> 09:33.208
Veracity's the only person
I know with an app that can

09:33.291 --> 09:35.291
crack the level of security
on Harper's data core.

09:35.375 --> 09:36.959
What you're saying
is you need her help?

09:37.041 --> 09:38.500
No, I need her app's help.

09:38.583 --> 09:41.834
Okay, you're stealing, Ryan's cheating...

09:41.917 --> 09:44.041
When did I become the respectable one?

09:44.125 --> 09:46.458
I don't like it. I feel like I need
to break a window.

09:55.875 --> 09:58.083
(Spyder) Okay. We're good.
Watch out, watch out!

09:58.166 --> 09:59.667
-Oh!
-Mm!

10:01.959 --> 10:04.667
Bryson fell asleep in class,
so I put a marble in his ear,

10:04.750 --> 10:06.625
and it didn't come out, and then--

10:12.125 --> 10:13.667
Sweet silence.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.041
Nice.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.834
-Ugh!
-What's wrong, man?

10:27.917 --> 10:29.041
The software's working fine,

10:29.125 --> 10:30.542
but I need more processing power.

10:31.333 --> 10:33.166
-What's up, V?
-"Oh, what's that, Veracity?

10:33.250 --> 10:35.333
Your tablet has a tracking device
that lets you know

10:35.417 --> 10:37.250
when people
who shouldn't have it, have it?"

10:37.333 --> 10:39.834
Is that an impression of me?
Because you're not even trying.

10:39.917 --> 10:40.834
Because I wasn't.

10:41.709 --> 10:42.667
Just ask her.

10:44.583 --> 10:45.750
Ask her what?

10:45.834 --> 10:47.709
Yes, Spyder, ask her what?

10:49.917 --> 10:51.375
Whoa!

10:52.792 --> 10:54.333
That is pretty advanced.

10:54.417 --> 10:56.750
Yeah, Harris locked his data core,

10:56.834 --> 10:59.750
and, uh, stupidly forgot the password,

10:59.834 --> 11:01.000
and now he can't open it.

11:02.375 --> 11:03.291
Really?

11:04.250 --> 11:07.125
Yes, apparently that is what happened.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.875
Oh, that is delicious.

11:09.959 --> 11:12.458
Sherlock Gnome here forgot the password

11:12.542 --> 11:15.000
and needs my help. Oh...

11:15.083 --> 11:16.375
Computer lab. Let's go. Now.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.458
What are you doing?
She's gonna see Ryan's secrets.

11:20.542 --> 11:23.250
I thought of one thing. You can't
expect me to think of everything.

11:24.041 --> 11:26.166
Cupcakes are for helpers.

11:31.333 --> 11:34.333
-You made me a cheater.
-Come on, we both know you're awesome.

11:34.417 --> 11:36.625
I wanted everyone to see it
so you would make the team.

11:36.709 --> 11:39.792
I don't care, okay?
Mark Walker earns his place.

11:39.875 --> 11:41.333
Mark Walker doesn't take shortcuts.

11:41.417 --> 11:43.625
Mark Walker wins... because he works hard.

11:43.709 --> 11:45.709
Well, Ryan Walker was trying
to help Mark Walker.

11:45.792 --> 11:49.000
Yeah, and now I have to do something
I've never done in my life.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.834
Come on, man.

11:50.917 --> 11:52.208
You're quitting?

11:54.208 --> 11:57.125
(laughs) I knew you wouldn't
leave me behind, man.

11:57.208 --> 11:59.208
Uh, yeah.

11:59.291 --> 12:01.500
Oh, now I get it!

12:01.583 --> 12:04.709
You wanted to prove you were good
enough, then shove it in our faces.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.375
This is you being a Bay City High jerk.

12:06.458 --> 12:09.083
No, no, no. It's-- it's not that at all.

12:11.542 --> 12:12.959
Whoa!

12:13.792 --> 12:15.959
(growls)

12:19.709 --> 12:21.667
Look out!

12:21.750 --> 12:22.917
(screaming)

12:23.000 --> 12:24.500
Something's wrong. Look!

12:25.458 --> 12:27.667
What's happening?
What's wrong with you guys?

12:27.750 --> 12:29.458
Dudes, put me down!

12:29.542 --> 12:32.709
I know what this is.
This is like what happens...

12:32.792 --> 12:34.792
When Harris is infected with the ooze.

12:34.875 --> 12:37.709
I need to find Harris. He's the only guy
who can cure this type of thing.

12:41.792 --> 12:44.875
And I'll... fight an entire school
that hates my guts because of you.

12:54.333 --> 12:55.875
What the...

12:57.417 --> 12:58.875
Whoa!

13:07.667 --> 13:08.792
Lights out!

13:11.083 --> 13:13.834
-(thudding)
-(laughs)

13:15.166 --> 13:17.333
-(growls)
-Come on!

13:18.500 --> 13:21.208
(scoffs) Link the cores via micro-USB.

13:21.291 --> 13:23.000
Connect them through
the tablet wirelessly.

13:23.083 --> 13:24.750
Plug in the encrypted date core.

13:24.834 --> 13:26.834
That you need my help decrypting.

13:26.917 --> 13:29.792
You run the app, which I totally could
have designed if I had the time.

13:29.875 --> 13:31.458
Yeah, it's cute that you think that.

13:34.375 --> 13:35.625
What happened to the lights?

13:38.500 --> 13:39.583
(Spyder) What?

13:42.834 --> 13:44.208
(screaming)

13:44.291 --> 13:45.542
(growls)

13:45.625 --> 13:46.625
Oh!

13:51.041 --> 13:52.792
Uh, Spyder, everything okay?

13:52.875 --> 13:55.667
-(screams)
-Define "okay."

13:55.750 --> 13:57.959
(growls)

14:01.250 --> 14:03.291
You got some skills, Walker.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.166
You would have made a good Badger.

14:07.834 --> 14:09.000
Look out!

14:17.083 --> 14:19.959
I've got to go back for my brother.
You think you can make it outside?

14:20.041 --> 14:21.083
Okay.

14:26.083 --> 14:27.750
(screams)

14:34.625 --> 14:36.875
Spyder! Harris!

14:37.959 --> 14:40.458
Mark! Anybody?

14:40.542 --> 14:42.709
(snarling, growling)

14:49.125 --> 14:51.917
(alarm rings loudly)

14:58.542 --> 15:00.792
(growling)

15:00.875 --> 15:03.834
One down, 400 more to go.

15:03.917 --> 15:06.917
What is up with this guy?
It's like he's a zombie or something.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.875
-Why are you so calm?
-Panic does no good at a time like this.

15:09.959 --> 15:12.917
-Hurry up, hurry up!
-We need a weapon! What do we have?

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
Uh... umbrella with a metal tip!

15:18.041 --> 15:19.125
Motherboard!

15:19.208 --> 15:22.000
Aha! Multiple laptop batteries.

15:22.083 --> 15:23.250
Duct tape!

15:24.083 --> 15:25.750
-Why do you have duct tape?
-Don't ask.

15:26.834 --> 15:28.792
(Harris) Power amplifier
and we are good to go.

15:30.125 --> 15:32.458
Three, two, one...

15:36.750 --> 15:38.375
-Nice work!
-(both) Thanks.

15:40.500 --> 15:42.583
We got to get the police.

15:42.667 --> 15:45.583
Uh, hey, I know you guys are new here,
but the exits is this way.

15:45.667 --> 15:47.000
Our friends are that way, so.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.125
(growling)

16:05.667 --> 16:07.417
Ryan, I can't reach you!

16:10.083 --> 16:11.709
You can now!

16:21.709 --> 16:23.750
It's not cheating now, right?

16:23.834 --> 16:25.625
If our lives are in danger,
it's not cheating.

16:25.709 --> 16:28.709
Hang on.
Come on, come on, come on.

16:36.667 --> 16:38.834
(electricity crackles)

16:40.000 --> 16:42.417
Why is every school we go to a death trap?

16:42.500 --> 16:46.083
-Come on! Harris, any ideas?
-Uh... okay.

16:46.166 --> 16:49.208
It's obviously an ooze infection,
but they're acting different than I did.

16:49.291 --> 16:51.083
If I could analyze a hair sample,

16:51.166 --> 16:52.583
I could probably make an antidote.

16:52.667 --> 16:55.625
Yeah, no, guys, take your time.
Nothing really going' on over here,

16:55.709 --> 16:58.250
just zapping my fellow students.

16:58.333 --> 16:59.750
Okay, I know where to can that.

16:59.834 --> 17:01.750
-All right, Spyder, plow the road!
-Go, go, go!

17:10.834 --> 17:13.250
(groaning)

17:16.709 --> 17:19.917
(Harris) Pulse low, oxygen level okay...

17:22.625 --> 17:25.083
Interesting. He still has tonsils.

17:25.166 --> 17:27.458
Good to know.
Anything about the infection?

17:27.542 --> 17:29.792
Oh, sorry. Yeah.

17:29.875 --> 17:32.375
Okay, the ooze is still in there,

17:32.458 --> 17:34.542
but the freezing cold must have cured him.

17:34.625 --> 17:37.208
Too bad we can't just shove
the whole school in that freezer.

17:37.291 --> 17:39.667
(chuckles) Spyder, that's brilliant.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.709
Wait, now I'm... brilliant?

17:42.458 --> 17:44.041
I don't know who I am anymore!

17:44.125 --> 17:45.625
All right, Mark, Harris, can you get

17:45.709 --> 17:48.166
all the infected students
outside in like, five minutes?

17:48.250 --> 17:49.792
Spyder, come on.

17:49.875 --> 17:52.458
Hey! Hey! Bay City East stinks,

17:52.542 --> 17:54.417
and the Badger's a stupid animal. Come on!

17:59.750 --> 18:01.500
I've got Beyoncé tickets!
If you want them,

18:01.583 --> 18:03.583
you're going to have
to catch me and eat my brains!

18:04.417 --> 18:06.125
(screaming)

18:06.208 --> 18:07.583
Wait, wait, wait!

18:14.250 --> 18:16.166
I don't like being popular!

18:16.250 --> 18:17.500
(screams)

18:19.375 --> 18:22.542
Three... two... one.

18:35.750 --> 18:37.959
Charging cold cannon.

18:42.583 --> 18:45.250
Everyone's outside.
The school's completely empty.

18:45.333 --> 18:47.291
Mech-Execute!

19:06.458 --> 19:08.834
(Spyder) Sweet! No more ooze zombies.

19:16.500 --> 19:19.625
(groaning)

19:21.458 --> 19:23.959
I can't feel my undercarriage.

19:24.583 --> 19:26.583
(school bell rings)

19:27.625 --> 19:29.709
I don't know what happened here yesterday,

19:29.792 --> 19:34.125
but I do know that you or one of your
Bay City punk friends was behind it.

19:34.208 --> 19:35.542
Yeah, well joke's on you,

19:35.625 --> 19:38.166
'cause none of my friends
are cool enough to be punks.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.208
(groans)

19:42.417 --> 19:44.417
So, they remember nothing?

19:44.500 --> 19:47.000
I don't remember anything
when I'm oozed up. Makes sense.

19:47.083 --> 19:48.333
-It's convenient.
-Yeah.

19:48.417 --> 19:52.208
Hey, Tiny Justice... here.

19:53.417 --> 19:55.333
The data core, you saved it.

19:55.417 --> 19:57.083
And decrypted it, yeah.

19:57.834 --> 20:00.709
Hey, relax. I didn't look at it, okay?

20:00.792 --> 20:03.166
-Because?
-Because, "A," I am not interested,

20:03.250 --> 20:05.583
and "B," you said it was private,

20:05.667 --> 20:07.625
and "C," you know,
you're surprisingly brave

20:07.709 --> 20:09.333
for... you.

20:09.417 --> 20:10.709
Hmm.

20:10.792 --> 20:13.792
You guys need some privacy?
Some special alone time?

20:13.875 --> 20:15.375
Lip balm? Breath mints?

20:15.458 --> 20:17.542
-Dude!
-Pass.

20:17.625 --> 20:18.834
Such a child.

20:25.291 --> 20:27.542
You hanging on to those?

20:27.625 --> 20:30.083
For missions, when we need them.

20:30.166 --> 20:32.667
I know, I know. Not for cheating.

20:32.750 --> 20:35.375
I'm sorry about that.
And I'm sorry you couldn't make the team.

20:35.458 --> 20:38.542
Well, actually, after Wade saw
what I could really do,

20:38.625 --> 20:40.542
he got them to give me my spot back.

20:40.625 --> 20:41.917
Wait, that's great!

20:42.000 --> 20:44.166
But... I turned them down.

20:45.583 --> 20:47.041
I'm already part of a team.

20:47.125 --> 20:50.041
And Grey's back, the monster's are back.

20:50.125 --> 20:51.250
We've got a lot to do.

20:52.333 --> 20:54.166
But thank you for trying to help,

20:54.250 --> 20:56.792
even in that really messed up way.

20:58.959 --> 21:00.625
Boo-ya, I did it.

21:00.709 --> 21:03.041
-I cracked the data core.
-Pretty sure that was Veracity.

21:03.125 --> 21:05.208
Ryan, check it.

21:05.291 --> 21:06.417
-Oh!
-(beeping)

21:09.917 --> 21:11.375
My birth parents are in there.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.834
Who are they?

21:21.208 --> 21:23.625
Your red ooze drove people crazy

21:23.709 --> 21:27.166
and can be neutralized with freezing cold.

21:27.250 --> 21:28.500
That doesn't help me.

21:29.542 --> 21:31.750
But it didn't kill anyone.

21:31.834 --> 21:33.709
And that was the purpose of the test.

21:33.792 --> 21:36.083
It didn't destroy human DNA, so...

21:36.166 --> 21:37.625
yay.

21:37.709 --> 21:40.166
Okay, okay, okay. I-I-I can fix it.

21:40.250 --> 21:42.083
I can fix it, I promise.

21:42.166 --> 21:43.583
I can get rid of those weaknesses.

21:44.458 --> 21:46.750
Then do it! And make more.

21:46.834 --> 21:48.458
A lot more.

21:48.542 --> 21:51.792
For what? It shouldn't take much
to enhance your powers.

21:52.959 --> 21:54.792
Who said it was for me?

21:55.959 --> 21:58.083
Wait. Who's it for?

21:59.208 --> 22:01.250
Grey! Who's it for?

22:03.500 --> 22:05.500
(theme music playing)

22:28.834 --> 22:30.250
(barks)
