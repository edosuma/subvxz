00:10.010 --> 00:11.845
- Hey, slow the fuck down.

00:18.810 --> 00:20.687
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

00:22.814 --> 00:24.524
Call from Mother.

00:24.524 --> 00:27.569
- You gotta be a freaking
rocket scientist.

00:27.569 --> 00:28.611
Call from Mother.

00:30.113 --> 00:32.282
Call from Mother.

00:33.742 --> 00:35.118
- Jeez, how the fuck...

00:39.289 --> 00:41.958
Yeah, you were right, Ma.

00:41.958 --> 00:44.127
I should've joined
the Boy Scouts.

00:44.127 --> 00:47.964
Maybe then I'd know how to tie
a fucking hangman's knot.

00:47.964 --> 00:50.216
Christ, I'm hungry.

00:59.642 --> 01:02.103
Hey, how much?
- 13.25.

01:03.646 --> 01:05.774
- I, uh, got a coupon.

01:05.774 --> 01:08.485
- You're supposed to tell us
about coupons on the phone.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.195
- Yeah, well, I forgot.

01:10.195 --> 01:11.821
- I feel bad, sir,

01:11.821 --> 01:14.032
but technically,
I can't give you the discount.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.909
- Don't sweat it, buddy.

01:15.909 --> 01:16.951
I'll just take it
out of your tip.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.205
- Guess I'll make
an exception today.

01:20.205 --> 01:21.498
It's 11.25.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.541
- Attaboy.
Here's 14.

01:24.959 --> 01:27.587
That's a 24.4% tip.

01:27.587 --> 01:29.714
- Weird you'd know that.

01:29.714 --> 01:32.842
- Wait, hey, hey.
This thing is covered in meat.

01:32.842 --> 01:36.387
- Yeah, we load them up.
- I ordered mushroom and onion.

01:36.387 --> 01:39.808
- Sure you didn't say
bacon and pepperoni by mistake?

01:39.808 --> 01:42.102
- How could anyone possibly
say bacon and pepperoni

01:42.102 --> 01:43.603
when they meant
mushroom and onion--

01:43.603 --> 01:45.188
- Sir, in my business,
you'd be surprised

01:45.188 --> 01:46.773
at what people say
when they order--

01:46.773 --> 01:48.733
- Kid, they don't sound alike.
They don't taste alike.

01:48.733 --> 01:51.569
One is two veggies,
the other's two meats.

01:51.569 --> 01:54.614
- Well, if you want me
to take it back...

01:54.614 --> 01:57.659
- Then you will?

01:59.577 --> 02:02.497
- Actually, I was planning
on you saying it's no big deal.

02:02.497 --> 02:06.376
- Well, it is a big deal.
Okay, it's a very big deal, man.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.461
Okay, do you know
what red meat does to you?

02:08.461 --> 02:11.297
It clogs your arteries,
it fucks with your brain cells,

02:11.297 --> 02:13.675
and it camps out in your colon
for, like, ever.

02:13.675 --> 02:15.343
So why would I wanna
be tricked into having

02:15.343 --> 02:17.303
a fucking cancer pizza
when I could have a healthy one?

02:21.599 --> 02:25.103
Okay, fine,
but I'm taking a buck back.

02:25.103 --> 02:28.940
What?
That's still a 15.5% tip.

02:28.940 --> 02:30.984
It's not bad considering
you were trying to kill me.

02:30.984 --> 02:35.655
â™ª Now,
now, now, now, now â™ª

02:35.655 --> 02:37.532
And that's
100 stories that should be

02:37.532 --> 02:39.617
on your radar
if they are not already.

02:39.617 --> 02:41.369
Here with their
take on all of it--

02:43.246 --> 02:45.039
Call from Mother.

02:45.039 --> 02:45.957
On a Friday--

02:47.250 --> 02:48.751
Call from Mother.

02:55.091 --> 02:57.760
-
Finally.

03:00.972 --> 03:03.099
Fucking idiot.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.371
Shit!

03:25.371 --> 03:27.165
Shit.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.465
All right.
Okay, okay.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.472
Call from Mother.

03:44.140 --> 03:46.434
Call from Mother.

03:48.269 --> 03:50.313
Call from Mother.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.733
Call from Mother.

04:55.586 --> 04:57.588
- Hey, what's up, man?
Can I help you?

04:57.588 --> 04:59.424
- Yeah, I, um--I'm
looking for a rope.

04:59.424 --> 05:00.883
- Rope?
Rope, awesome.

05:00.883 --> 05:04.429
Right this way.
Um, what do you need it for?

05:04.429 --> 05:07.223
- Nothing.
I'm just looking for a rope.

05:07.223 --> 05:08.808
- Right, but what
do you need it for?

05:08.808 --> 05:10.101
What, are you lifting something?

05:10.101 --> 05:12.228
You're towing something?
What do you got?

05:12.228 --> 05:14.230
- Towing something, yeah.

05:14.230 --> 05:16.274
- Uh, what?

05:16.274 --> 05:18.526
- What?
- Well, what are you towing?

05:18.526 --> 05:20.320
- A boat.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.863
- Boat?
Oh, then you don't need a rope.

05:21.863 --> 05:22.739
You need a trailer hitch
for your car.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.407
Right this way, man--

05:24.407 --> 05:26.576
- Yeah, no, I'm not
towing the boat with a car,
so...

05:26.576 --> 05:28.619
- Okay, so what are you
towing it with?

05:30.747 --> 05:33.291
- Another boat.
- Another boat.

05:33.291 --> 05:36.294
All right, in that case, this is
as good as it gets right here.

05:36.294 --> 05:37.837
This is your rope.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.672
- Yeah, no, that's--
that's gonna be too thick.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.758
- Too thick.
All right, all right.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.926
Then, uh, runner-up would be
right here.

05:43.926 --> 05:45.386
That one's nice and thin.

05:45.386 --> 05:48.056
- Um, you know, that's gonna be
a little scratchy.

05:48.056 --> 05:51.059
- Scratchy?
Why does that matter for a boat?

05:51.059 --> 05:52.935
- You know what? Maybe--maybe
just 10 feet of this one.

05:52.935 --> 05:54.771
This looks pretty good.
- 10 feet of this?

05:54.771 --> 05:56.522
I mean, she don't have
the tensile strength

05:56.522 --> 05:57.523
to do what you're trying
to do, man.

05:57.523 --> 05:58.775
Come on.
- This is, it's good.

05:58.775 --> 06:01.194
That's the one I want,
so please, just 10 feet.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.488
- Hey, buddy, hey.
You come to me for help, right?

06:03.488 --> 06:05.865
I'm the rope guy, all right?
I know rope, all right?

06:05.865 --> 06:08.618
And this--this won't pull a bag
of balloons across the moon.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.161
All right?
What's your payload?

06:10.161 --> 06:13.289
- My what?
- How big is your boat, man?

06:13.289 --> 06:14.916
'Cause this thing
can get caught in a current,

06:14.916 --> 06:15.875
it can get ripped--
- Okay, man, look.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.293
I'm not--I'm not
actually towing anything.

06:17.293 --> 06:18.795
I just need a rope, so please--

06:18.795 --> 06:20.046
- For what?
What do you need it for?

06:20.046 --> 06:22.840
- It's personal, okay?
It's...

06:25.009 --> 06:28.012
- Oh, okay.
All right, yeah.

06:28.012 --> 06:29.055
All right, in that case...

06:31.516 --> 06:34.018
You need one of these,
all right?

06:34.018 --> 06:35.937
You know, especially if you're
gonna, you know, freeze it.

06:37.980 --> 06:39.732
- To freeze it?

06:39.732 --> 06:42.276
- Yeah, you know, freeze it,
you know, for "tug-of-war."

06:42.276 --> 06:44.445
- Why--why did you just
do that in quotes?

06:44.445 --> 06:45.780
- Oh, come on, man.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.323
You know what
tug-of-war is, man.

06:47.323 --> 06:49.742
You're gonna play dumb with me?

06:49.742 --> 06:52.537
You know, when you get the rope,
you dip it in the water, right?

06:52.537 --> 06:54.330
You and your friend,
you put it in the freezer,

06:54.330 --> 06:55.623
you take it out, you shove it
up each other's ass.

06:55.623 --> 06:57.458
All right, you know?

06:57.458 --> 06:59.127
Some people call it
the cowboy popsicle.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.878
I mean, depending on where
you're from, I don't know.

07:00.878 --> 07:02.463
But hey, feel this.
Feel this.

07:02.463 --> 07:03.506
This is what
you're looking for, man.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.091
Look at the ridges.
Come on, see the ridges?

07:05.091 --> 07:07.468
Yeah, it's really hard going in,

07:07.468 --> 07:09.720
but real soft
like a kitten coming out.

07:09.720 --> 07:10.596
Or so I've heard.
I don't know.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.891
- I'll take it.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.563
Now that's what
I'm fucking talking about!

07:27.780 --> 07:28.865
Jesus Christ.

07:49.177 --> 07:50.678
Yeah, Ma, what do you want?

07:50.678 --> 07:52.305
I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.306
Your brother is dead.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.765
- What?

07:54.765 --> 07:59.020
- Jeffrey's dead.
He just killed himself.

08:00.229 --> 08:01.272
- Motherfuck--

08:05.193 --> 08:08.112
- It's okay, we're gonna
stick together, okay?

08:12.366 --> 08:14.160
I know.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.745
I can't believe it.

08:15.745 --> 08:18.623
-
Oh, my...

08:23.252 --> 08:24.795
He's gone.

08:28.633 --> 08:29.800
Jeffrey is gone.

08:31.969 --> 08:33.888
- It's okay, honey.

08:33.888 --> 08:36.140
You just--you just
let it all out, honey.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.016
You just let it out.
