02:09.199 --> 02:11.800
All right, all right. All right, all right.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.500
Never

03:20.600 --> 03:21.900
say

03:23.100 --> 03:24.100
no.

03:41.400 --> 03:43.500
Well, this is Kingman's
defining moment, Marv.

03:43.600 --> 03:46.200
If they win, they guarantee themselves
a spot in the playoffs.

03:46.300 --> 03:47.700
Everybody get on the King's back

03:47.800 --> 03:49.500
and I'm going to lead you
to the promised land.

03:49.600 --> 03:51.800
- All right? On one, on one. Ready?
- Break!

03:51.900 --> 03:53.000
Go deep.
Watch your left!

03:53.100 --> 03:54.100
Let's go!

03:54.200 --> 03:55.900
Pick him up. Pick him up.

03:57.400 --> 03:58.700
Sanders. Sanders.

04:00.500 --> 04:01.400
Go wide!

04:01.600 --> 04:02.800
Hut-hut!

04:02.900 --> 04:03.800
Hut!

04:04.600 --> 04:07.100
<i>All right, here's
Kingman. Drops back in the pocket.</i>

04:07.200 --> 04:10.300
<i>He's got Sanders wide open
in the end zone.</i>

04:10.800 --> 04:13.400
<i>Kingman is on the run.
He's inside the five.</i>

04:13.900 --> 04:17.100
<i>He stiff-arms. It's the Kingman swing.</i>

04:17.399 --> 04:21.399
<i>And he is in! Touchdown, Rebels.
They've won it.</i>

04:21.500 --> 04:23.300
<i>What a
tremendous play by Kingman, Marv.</i>

04:23.400 --> 04:24.700
<i>But I have to wonder,
yesterday he was...</i>

04:24.800 --> 04:26.700
The King does it again!

04:28.400 --> 04:30.100
- Go Joe!
- Go Joe!

04:35.400 --> 04:38.100
- Never say no!
- Never say no!

04:38.200 --> 04:39.200
Yeah!

04:51.500 --> 04:52.600
<i>WZPZ FM.</i>

04:52.800 --> 04:56.900
<i>Hey, Boston. Happy New Year.
And a special shout out to our Rebels.</i>

04:57.000 --> 04:58.500
<i>Don't party too hard, boys.</i>

04:58.600 --> 05:02.400
<i>You're going to need all your strength
to bring home that championship.</i>

05:04.700 --> 05:06.000
- Enjoy your drink.
- To us.

05:06.100 --> 05:07.100
Hope it's okay.

05:07.300 --> 05:09.600
I'm telling you guys,
these aren't the normal onion rings.

05:09.700 --> 05:14.600
They got garlic and mint leaves.
I mean, like, beluga caviar.

05:14.700 --> 05:16.900
Hey, Coop. Coop, check it out.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.100
- See the hottie? 12 o'clock, tan dress?
- Oh, yeah.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.800
I think she said
you have a killer smile, bro.

05:21.900 --> 05:23.200
I do.

05:23.800 --> 05:25.600
You should go talk to her.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.700
- You think so?
- I know so. Come on.

05:27.800 --> 05:31.900
Get in there. Get in there.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, swamp mouth.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.800
Use some of this. Chicks dig it.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.300
- Webber, you got a pen?
- Why?

05:36.500 --> 05:39.200
Because you might want
to take some notes.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.100
What's up?

05:55.100 --> 05:56.400
Webber!

05:58.300 --> 06:02.600
I told you, they bumped up shoot.
I have to catch last flight to Paris.

06:03.500 --> 06:04.600
But Tatianna will miss you.

06:04.700 --> 06:08.100
The King doesn't want his queen
to miss him too much.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.300
So I got you a little something special.

06:10.600 --> 06:13.200
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

06:15.300 --> 06:17.900
Tatianna, Tatianna. Which one?
Which one?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.400
No peeking.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.200
Dreams are on Joe tonight, honey.

06:24.400 --> 06:25.800
Happy New Year.

06:25.900 --> 06:28.400
- Channel?
- Or Chanel.

06:33.500 --> 06:36.100
Whoa, Sanders.
Where you going?

06:38.700 --> 06:39.800
Just past your bedtime?

06:39.900 --> 06:42.200
Yeah, well, you know,
it's New Year's Eve.

06:42.300 --> 06:44.400
Want to go home,
hug the wife, kiss the kids.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.100
All right, thanks for coming.
Happy New Year.

06:47.900 --> 06:49.900
- All right, Happy New Year.
- All right, see you at practice.

06:50.100 --> 06:51.500
All right, see you.

06:52.700 --> 06:53.900
All right, Joe. Come on, it's real funny.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.400
Now, just give me back the wallet,
all right?

06:55.500 --> 06:58.500
I'm looking to confiscate
Sanders' man card,

06:58.600 --> 07:01.000
but his wife, Maria,
has already done it.

07:02.900 --> 07:06.000
- Yes, really...
- Come on. Get a life, Sanders.

07:06.100 --> 07:07.800
Oh, you call this "life"?
That ain't life, Joe.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.500
Oh, you call this "life"?
That ain't life, Joe.

07:10.900 --> 07:13.700
- Whatever.
- He's mad. That was funny, man.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.200
- Who's ready to party?
- I am.

07:17.400 --> 07:18.700
Party!

07:18.800 --> 07:20.200
Yeah!

07:21.500 --> 07:23.500
Where can I get a man card?

07:29.300 --> 07:32.100
- Why? The night is still young!
- We can walk Spike.

07:32.200 --> 07:33.800
- Play the guitars, Joe. Come on.
- We were just bonding.

07:33.900 --> 07:35.300
- I love that idea.
- We're starting to jell.

07:35.400 --> 07:36.900
- Call me.
- Joe...

07:37.300 --> 07:38.900
We were doing so good.

07:43.300 --> 07:47.400
Hey, Spike. There's my boy.
Haven't seen you all night.

07:48.700 --> 07:51.500
Do you know who the greatest
quarterback of all time is?

07:51.700 --> 07:53.800
Just checking. Let's go! Huddle up!

07:55.400 --> 07:58.200
Can you feel it? Can you smell it?
Do you believe it?

07:58.300 --> 08:01.300
Z- slant Mississippi! On three. Ready?
Break! Hut! Hut! Hut!

08:01.400 --> 08:02.800
Come on, Spike.
We need a football biscuit.

08:04.100 --> 08:06.100
Oh, that's a good one.
Oh, this is a good one.

08:06.200 --> 08:07.800
Kingman drops back, he's...
Oh, defenders are coming around.

08:09.100 --> 08:10.200
Post pattern, Spike. Post pattern.

08:11.400 --> 08:12.700
He throws.

08:12.800 --> 08:15.500
Touchdown! They're going crazy.

08:18.400 --> 08:19.600
Crazy.

08:34.799 --> 08:37.400
<i>Gracias, Rosa. Enjoy your vacation.</i>

08:37.500 --> 08:39.500
What do you want to do, Spike?
What do you want to do today?

08:39.600 --> 08:41.200
It's a new year.

08:41.700 --> 08:45.200
You want to play football?
You want to go for a walk?

08:45.800 --> 08:51.300
You want to watch the new ESPN
special profile on Joe Kingman?

08:52.600 --> 08:55.800
I know you do. Me, too. Watch. Watch.
Here we go.

08:55.900 --> 08:57.300
Attaboy.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.800
<i>Blessed with crazy strength and
ridiculous agility...</i>

09:01.200 --> 09:02.200
Ridiculous.

09:02.300 --> 09:04.000
<i>...Joe Kingman could have succeeded
on talent alone.</i>

09:04.100 --> 09:06.800
<i>But what really sets
this future hall-of-famer apart</i>

09:06.900 --> 09:08.500
<i>is his passion for the game.</i>

09:08.600 --> 09:11.400
<i>And no one sums it up better
than Joe himself.</i>

09:11.500 --> 09:13.600
<i>- Wait a minute, that's not what I said.
- Listen, listen.</i>

09:13.700 --> 09:15.700
<i>- What I said was this. Life...
- Life...</i>

09:15.800 --> 09:17.800
<i>...holds many pleasures for me.
... holds many pleasures for me.</i>

09:17.900 --> 09:19.400
<i>- But...
- But...</i>

09:19.500 --> 09:21.000
<i>...nothing...
... nothing...</i>

09:21.100 --> 09:23.000
<i>...nothing beats the thrill...
... nothing beats the thrill...</i>

09:23.100 --> 09:24.900
<i>...of playing on that field...
... of playing on that field...</i>

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
<i>...every Sunday.
... every Sunday.</i>

09:26.100 --> 09:28.600
<i>- Football is my life.
- Football is my life.</i>

09:29.000 --> 09:31.100
<i>- Beyond the field...
- Beyond the field...</i>

09:31.200 --> 09:33.500
<i>...nothing else matters.
... nothing else matters. Watch this.</i>

09:33.600 --> 09:34.600
<i>Nothing.</i>

09:34.700 --> 09:37.000
<i>If nothing else really matters,</i>

09:37.100 --> 09:40.500
<i>why does that championship ring
elude Kingman?</i>

09:40.600 --> 09:44.000
<i>Some of the experts say
it's because he's too selfish.</i>

09:44.100 --> 09:45.300
<i>I mean, think about it...</i>

09:48.200 --> 09:50.300
How does that sound, Stuey?

09:50.900 --> 09:53.700
<i>Joe, you're a 30-something now,
not a 20-something.</i>

09:55.000 --> 09:57.500
<i>The clock is ticking, Joe.
Ticking on your career.</i>

09:57.600 --> 10:00.900
Blah, blah, blah...

10:01.500 --> 10:04.900
You come talk to me when you have
your own action figure, Stuey.

10:10.200 --> 10:11.600
<i>- Yeah?
Pardon me, Mr. Kingman.</i>

10:11.900 --> 10:13.400
I have a visitor here at reception.

10:13.600 --> 10:16.600
<i>- A Peyton Kelly, sir.
- I don't know any Peytons.</i>

10:16.800 --> 10:18.300
A young lady.

10:19.100 --> 10:22.400
- Is she cute?
- Oh, exceedingly so, sir.

10:22.500 --> 10:25.700
Well, what are you waiting for, Larry?
Send her up.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.600
He never says "no. "

10:29.800 --> 10:32.000
I am the king. Thank you very much.

10:32.500 --> 10:33.700
Hmm.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.400
Look out.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.600
Hello.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.300
- Goodbye.
Hey!

10:51.300 --> 10:53.900
Look, kid, I don't do Girl Scout cookies,
okay?

10:54.000 --> 10:55.300
You don't get abs like these

10:55.400 --> 10:57.900
eating Peanut Butter Patties,
you know?

10:58.000 --> 11:01.900
Go ahead, hit me. Come on!
Give it a shot. Come on.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.700
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

11:11.900 --> 11:13.100
Bye-bye.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.200
It's ridiculous.

11:22.400 --> 11:26.100
I don't know what it is you're selling.
Look what I have, here's a hundo.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.300
I don't want any money. I want...

11:28.400 --> 11:32.200
I know. I know what you want. I get it.
It's what the world wants.

11:32.300 --> 11:35.600
An autograph of Joe Kingman.
They all want it, eight to 80.

11:35.700 --> 11:38.300
You'll probably go sell it,
but I'm going to give it to you for free.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.500
Because I'm Joe Kingman,
humanitarian.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.800
Happy New Year. I'll be right back.

11:43.300 --> 11:46.600
You have a bulldog. Come here, boy.

11:47.100 --> 11:48.300
You're so cute.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.700
Easy, easy.
He's a very vicious attack dog.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.700
Yeah. He's going to lick me to death.

11:53.800 --> 11:58.000
Listen, you just can't come walking
into strangers' homes like this.

11:58.900 --> 12:00.300
There are a lot of weirdos out there
in the world.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.400
- Didn't your mom ever teach you that?
- Yeah.

12:02.500 --> 12:04.900
- Well, where is she?
- On an airplane.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.200
On an airplane?
Well, who are you here with?

12:07.300 --> 12:08.300
My father.

12:08.400 --> 12:11.200
Well, you better go get him,
because I'm sure he's looking for you.

12:11.300 --> 12:14.400
- He's not looking for me.
- How do you know?

12:14.500 --> 12:17.500
Because he's looking at me.

12:18.700 --> 12:20.100
What?

12:20.200 --> 12:25.100
Hi, we've never met before.
You were married to my mom, Sara.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.600
Sara Kelly?

12:27.200 --> 12:31.000
My name is Peyton. I'm your daughter.

13:01.900 --> 13:04.200
No. No. Nope. No!

13:05.200 --> 13:09.100
No. Time out.
Sara and I never had a kid.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.300
- She wrote you a note.
- Wrote me a note.

13:26.100 --> 13:30.900
"Joe, I know this is a big surprise,
but Peyton is your daughter.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.600
"I need you to watch her for a month.
It's an emergency.

13:34.700 --> 13:37.900
"I'll explain everything
when I get back. Sara. "

13:38.600 --> 13:41.300
You sure got a lot of pictures
of yourself in here.

13:41.400 --> 13:44.600
You expect me to believe
you're my kid, based on this?

13:44.700 --> 13:46.700
- Anybody could have written this.
- Oh, yeah.

13:48.300 --> 13:51.400
I've also got this.
It's my birth certificate.

13:51.500 --> 13:53.200
Birth certificate?

13:57.000 --> 14:00.200
- Your name is on it.
- My name is...

14:01.700 --> 14:02.600
My name?

14:02.700 --> 14:03.800
Awesome!

14:05.000 --> 14:06.200
<i>Ready? Break!</i>

14:06.500 --> 14:08.300
My name's not on this.

14:09.100 --> 14:10.300
"Joseph Kingman. "

14:12.900 --> 14:14.100
<i>Hut! Hut! Hut!</i>

14:16.500 --> 14:18.600
<i>- We've got a situation.
- Touchdown!</i>

14:23.400 --> 14:24.600
Fix it.

14:25.500 --> 14:26.500
Oh!

14:27.900 --> 14:29.900
Don't you think
you should have told me about this?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.300
- I didn't know.
- You didn't know you had an ex-wife?

14:32.400 --> 14:35.400
That was a long time ago.
We were crazy in love, but too young.

14:35.500 --> 14:39.400
Didn't even last longer than a year,
and we never had a baby.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.100
Okay, but for argument's sake,

14:41.200 --> 14:45.400
is there the teeniest, tiniest possibility
that this child could be yours?

14:45.500 --> 14:47.600
Think hard.

14:47.700 --> 14:49.000
I don't know.

14:49.100 --> 14:51.100
We got the separation,
the divorce was final,

14:51.200 --> 14:54.500
she came by to pick up
a few of her things and then we...

14:54.600 --> 14:55.700
We...

15:00.900 --> 15:02.200
Is anyone else hungry?

15:02.300 --> 15:04.300
- Hungry?
- Joe...

15:04.400 --> 15:07.600
When did this, "We... We...
Is anyone else hungry" happen?

15:08.400 --> 15:09.900
About eight, nine years ago.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.900
- How old are you, kid?
- Eight.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.400
Congratulations, Joe.

15:15.200 --> 15:17.000
This isn't happening to me.

15:18.600 --> 15:21.400
Muffin, just talk to your Auntie Stella.

15:21.500 --> 15:22.600
Hmm?

15:22.900 --> 15:27.000
It says here that your mom
is not coming back for a month.

15:27.100 --> 15:29.500
She's on her way to Africa.

15:29.600 --> 15:32.400
What kind of a selfish,
self-centered person dumps their kid...

15:32.500 --> 15:36.900
She's on a water sanitation project
bringing fresh drinking water

15:37.000 --> 15:39.900
to the drought-ravaged children
of the Sudan.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.400
If I had a dime
for every time I heard that one.

15:43.500 --> 15:45.000
So on her way to save the world,

15:45.100 --> 15:47.600
your mom just suddenly decided
to leave you here?

15:47.700 --> 15:52.400
I begged her. I said,
"Well, why don't I stay with my father?"

15:52.500 --> 15:56.800
And she said, "Well, baby, he doesn't
know about you yet. " And I said...

15:56.900 --> 16:00.500
I get it. I get it.
So, who else can you stay with?

16:01.300 --> 16:03.900
I got it. I got it. I'm a genius.

16:04.600 --> 16:06.400
Sara has a sister.

16:08.100 --> 16:12.000
Goombah, Grip, Grime... Carmen!

16:12.200 --> 16:14.300
- Karen.
- Karen. What about her?

16:15.200 --> 16:16.600
She's...

16:17.800 --> 16:20.000
She's dead.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.000
Oh, that's convenient.

16:23.900 --> 16:24.900
What?

16:25.600 --> 16:27.200
How do we get in touch
with your mom?

16:27.300 --> 16:29.300
- Her cell won't work in Kassala.
- Email?

16:29.400 --> 16:31.200
They don't have Internet there.

16:31.300 --> 16:32.900
How did you get here again?

16:33.000 --> 16:36.700
We flew to Boston together,
and then she put me in a car.

16:36.800 --> 16:41.700
And the car just magically
dropped you off at some man's house?

16:41.800 --> 16:45.900
- Not some man. My father.
- So you say.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.900
- Want a paternity test?
- Yes. That's a great idea.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.900
Let's do that. No problem.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.600
I don't like needles.
So if they don't take blood, no problem.

16:54.700 --> 16:57.800
Not in the middle of negotiating
our Fanny's deal, it's not.

16:57.900 --> 17:00.100
These things never stay quiet,
trust me.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.400
If she does turn out to be yours,

17:01.500 --> 17:03.300
you'll look like a guy
who had a kid and ditched her

17:03.400 --> 17:05.900
and you can
kiss your mega-bucks goodbye.

17:07.099 --> 17:08.500
- Stella.
- Hmm.

17:10.500 --> 17:12.500
We don't even look alike.

17:15.500 --> 17:18.599
Oh, no. Not at all.

17:19.700 --> 17:22.900
- Thanks a lot for the heads up, Larry.
- Hey, I told you she was cute.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.200
I'm late.

17:41.400 --> 17:43.300
Let's go. No huddle.

17:43.400 --> 17:46.600
- No back seat.
- So what? Get in the car.

17:46.700 --> 17:50.000
If you get in an accident,
the air bag will hurt me.

17:50.200 --> 17:54.000
Oh, come on, I don't have time
for the safety lesson, please!

17:57.400 --> 17:58.700
Come here.

18:19.600 --> 18:20.800
So late.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.300
I've got four weeks
to make up for eight years,

18:23.500 --> 18:25.500
so let's get started, shall we?

18:26.700 --> 18:28.100
I'm going to ask you some questions

18:28.200 --> 18:30.400
and you're going to give me
some answers, okay?

18:30.500 --> 18:32.000
Now, for example,

18:32.100 --> 18:36.500
if you asked me what my favorite thing
to do was, I would say ballet.

18:36.600 --> 18:38.600
So what's your favorite thing to do?

18:38.700 --> 18:40.800
That's easy. Play football.

18:40.900 --> 18:41.900
Football.

18:43.100 --> 18:44.300
Come on!

18:45.000 --> 18:48.800
If you could only save one thing
in a fire, what would it be?

18:48.900 --> 18:50.900
My Heisman.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.800
No, wait... I know.

18:54.700 --> 18:58.000
My limited edition
Joe Kingman sneakers.

19:02.500 --> 19:05.500
Come on, horseradish.
No more questions.

19:05.600 --> 19:07.400
Just one more question.

19:09.100 --> 19:12.700
What's the best thing
that's ever happened to you?

19:12.800 --> 19:15.200
Listen, I got a question for you.

19:15.300 --> 19:18.000
Why didn't your mom
just bring you here herself?

19:20.300 --> 19:21.500
Want a cookie?

19:21.600 --> 19:23.900
No, I don't want a cookie.
Stop trying to change the subject.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.800
But you said you were hungry.

19:25.900 --> 19:29.500
- And I made them special for you.
- Fine, fine.

19:32.600 --> 19:36.100
- Now, about your mom.
- I told you, it was last-minute.

19:36.200 --> 19:38.500
I just can't believe that the Sara I knew

19:38.600 --> 19:42.300
would just let her daughter
show up at my doorstep alone.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.300
I know what happened.

19:50.400 --> 19:51.700
- You do?
- Yeah.

19:55.100 --> 19:57.200
- She's gained a lot of weight.
- No.

19:57.300 --> 19:59.800
What's she pushing now? About 180?

19:59.900 --> 20:01.000
Deuce?

20:09.500 --> 20:10.700
Let's go.

20:12.100 --> 20:14.300
What do you think, you're some
roaming free safety or something?

20:14.400 --> 20:16.900
This is "cover-two," little lady,
so stay close.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Are you okay?

20:18.100 --> 20:21.600
Do I sound okay?
What did you put in those cookies?

20:21.700 --> 20:26.200
- Milk, flour, eggs and cinnamon...
- Cinnamon!

20:26.300 --> 20:28.800
Cinnamon? I'm allergic to cinnamon.

20:28.900 --> 20:31.500
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- All you got to say is, "I'm sorry"?

20:31.600 --> 20:34.500
I sound like this, "I'm sorry"?
Cinnamon!

20:36.800 --> 20:38.700
I'm allergic to nuts.

20:38.800 --> 20:42.000
Joe. Joe, don't forget I got that
publicity shoot set up for you today.

20:42.100 --> 20:44.200
- You have to be there this time.
- I'll be there.

20:44.300 --> 20:45.800
What do you think,
I'm stupid or something?

20:45.900 --> 20:47.600
Stop touching me.

20:49.100 --> 20:50.600
Stop eating so much.

20:50.700 --> 20:54.100
- You're late, Joe. That's a $500 fine.
- Start a tab.

20:54.200 --> 20:57.700
Hey, sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.

20:59.600 --> 21:02.500
King's here, Danville. I got it.
King's here.

21:02.600 --> 21:04.600
Get a submarine sandwich
and a diet soda.

21:04.700 --> 21:06.800
All right, let's go. Sixty-six seam,
slot left on three, on three. Ready?

21:06.900 --> 21:08.900
All right, let's go. Sixty-six seam,
slot left on three, on three. Ready?

21:11.400 --> 21:12.700
Suffering succotash,
Sylvester,

21:12.800 --> 21:16.300
something seems to be wrong
with your mouth.

21:16.500 --> 21:20.200
I said sixty-six, slot seam left on three.
On three. Ready?

21:21.700 --> 21:24.600
Hey, Joe.
Looks like you got a rogue fan.

21:24.700 --> 21:28.400
- I'm not a fan. I'm Joe's daughter.
- What's everybody staring at?

21:29.600 --> 21:30.700
I didn't know Joe had a kid.

21:30.800 --> 21:33.200
Yo, I don't think Joe knew
Joe had a kid.

21:38.900 --> 21:41.400
- Stay here.
- Yes, sir.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Hat.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.100
Give me this!

21:51.300 --> 21:53.200
Here's what you got to read right there.
You all set?

21:53.300 --> 21:56.900
Here we go. And three, two, one... Go!

21:57.000 --> 22:00.300
Boston Rebels! Experience the heat!

22:03.700 --> 22:06.600
Boston Rebels! Catch the magic.

22:06.900 --> 22:11.200
Boston Rebels! Feel the...
Wait a minute. Who writes this?

22:13.500 --> 22:16.500
Hey, let's get Joe.
He won't be expecting it.

22:16.700 --> 22:18.600
We'll put ice in his bath.

22:18.700 --> 22:21.300
Coop, look. Look real close.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.900
Joe is in an ice bath.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.100
- Well, we'll put colder ice in it.
- Glove.

22:29.400 --> 22:30.600
Yeah.

22:32.800 --> 22:34.500
Webber, think about this.

22:35.500 --> 22:37.500
Big surprise, eh, Kingman?

22:38.600 --> 22:40.000
More like a safety blitz.

22:40.100 --> 22:41.300
Yeah, well, you should be happy.

22:41.400 --> 22:44.600
I remember how happy I was
when my kids were born.

22:44.700 --> 22:45.900
Yeah, but you knew
they were coming.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.600
Yeah, well, either way, she's here now.

22:51.300 --> 22:52.500
What's your name, sweetheart?

22:52.600 --> 22:54.300
- Peyton.
- Peyton, that's cute.

22:54.500 --> 22:56.000
- Hi, Peyton.
- Hi.

22:56.100 --> 22:59.200
Oh, that's cool.
Like... Like, Peyton Manning?

22:59.300 --> 23:01.500
No, dude.
It's like Walter Payton, right?

23:01.600 --> 23:03.300
No. Peyton Rous.

23:06.100 --> 23:08.500
- Who's that?
- He won the Nobel Prize.

23:08.600 --> 23:10.100
For what team?

23:14.200 --> 23:15.800
In medicine.

23:17.500 --> 23:20.500
He's not even a football player.
That's stupid.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.800
"Stupid" is a mean word.

23:22.900 --> 23:24.600
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

23:24.700 --> 23:25.700
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

23:25.800 --> 23:26.800
- Isn't.
- Is!

23:26.900 --> 23:27.900
- Isn't.
- Is!

23:28.000 --> 23:29.800
Quiet. Both of you.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.400
Step away from my pants.

23:43.300 --> 23:44.700
Awkward.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.400
Hey, sweetie, it's okay.

23:47.500 --> 23:49.800
See, those are Monroe's
very special underwear.

23:49.900 --> 23:51.800
You see,
he needs to wear them every game,

23:51.900 --> 23:53.600
- or he thinks we won't win.
- Oh.

23:54.800 --> 23:57.000
<i>Hey, I'm on SportsCenter again.</i>

24:00.900 --> 24:02.200
I'm hungry.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.900
Please don't touch anything.
Stand right here.

24:06.100 --> 24:08.600
Tonight's Tuesday.
We're going to carbo-load.

24:09.700 --> 24:12.100
Twenty-twenty-sixty ratio.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.200
What?

24:13.700 --> 24:16.800
Hey, do you have any Jell-O?
I want some Jell-O.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.700
Like I said, please don't touch.
Fingerprints. I don't like fingerprints.

24:20.800 --> 24:21.800
Stand right here, don't do anything.

24:21.900 --> 24:24.300
I'm not giving you 28 grams
of empty carbohydrates.

24:24.400 --> 24:27.400
We do not do simple sugars
in this house.

24:27.500 --> 24:31.500
But I'm a kid and kids love sugar.
I mean, the simpler the better.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.400
Well, my dad never let me have sugar.

24:33.500 --> 24:36.300
Oh, is that why you never smile?

24:38.100 --> 24:39.200
Mmm.

24:47.800 --> 24:50.800
Listen, you better eat your food
before it gets cold.

24:50.900 --> 24:52.900
But it's as big as a mountain.

24:54.800 --> 24:57.400
Listen, if you're going to make the pros,
you have to get your appetite up.

24:57.500 --> 24:59.000
Let's go. Eat.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.500
You got a little...

25:02.600 --> 25:05.800
- A little something right here.
- What?

25:07.700 --> 25:08.700
I got what?

25:16.600 --> 25:19.300
I'm going to go and wash the dishes.

25:19.400 --> 25:20.900
You can eat.

25:22.100 --> 25:25.000
And finish eating.

25:32.900 --> 25:36.000
I don't have a guest room
because I don't like guests.

25:36.100 --> 25:37.800
But you can sleep here.

25:37.900 --> 25:40.400
- What's this?
- That is a universal remote.

25:40.600 --> 25:43.000
It controls the world.
And you don't need to touch it.

25:43.100 --> 25:45.100
What's the "romance" button for?

25:45.200 --> 25:50.100
The romance button
is for a little Valentine's Day magic.

25:53.700 --> 25:56.900
Turn... Turn this off. Turn it off.
Turn it off.

25:59.500 --> 26:02.400
Turn it off. Press the button.
Turn it off.

26:06.400 --> 26:08.200
Stop touching things.

26:10.700 --> 26:13.600
Aren't you going to tell me
a bedtime story?

26:16.400 --> 26:18.900
Bedtime story... Bedtime story.

26:20.600 --> 26:21.800
Yeah.

26:25.100 --> 26:28.000
The Big Bad Wolf

26:28.100 --> 26:30.700
blew down the Grammy's house

26:30.800 --> 26:33.800
and ate the Goldilocks

26:33.900 --> 26:37.100
and then there was something
about the porridge.

26:37.200 --> 26:38.400
The end.

26:38.500 --> 26:39.700
Good night.

26:39.800 --> 26:42.300
I mean a real bedtime story, Joe.

26:44.400 --> 26:48.300
A bedtime story is supposed
to make you feel peaceful.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.300
I'll show you.

26:50.400 --> 26:53.300
Lean back, relax,
and listen to the story.

26:54.700 --> 26:58.100
Fine. Fine. I'm going to listen
to this one time, then that's it.

26:58.200 --> 27:01.100
Then you go to sleep.
Do you understand me?

27:01.600 --> 27:04.300
Once upon a time there was a princess

27:04.400 --> 27:07.300
and she had a lot of beautiful dresses.

27:07.400 --> 27:10.100
She had a pink dress, a red dress,

27:10.200 --> 27:13.700
a blue dress, a green dress,
a purple dress,

27:13.800 --> 27:15.800
- an orange dress, a yellow dress...
- I get it. I get it. I get it.

27:15.900 --> 27:19.200
A lot of dresses, a lot of colors.
So what?

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
So each dress had a secret power.

27:23.700 --> 27:27.500
The pink dress,
which had pink sparkles all over it,

27:27.600 --> 27:29.600
could make her fly.

27:29.700 --> 27:34.500
And the blue dress,
which had blue sparkles all over it,

27:34.600 --> 27:36.800
could make her tiny.

27:37.500 --> 27:42.100
And the green dress,
which had green sparkles all over it,

27:42.200 --> 27:44.400
could make her sleep.

28:05.300 --> 28:06.500
Whoa!

28:10.100 --> 28:11.400
Hey, baby.

28:12.200 --> 28:13.600
Why didn't you answer me
when I called?

28:13.700 --> 28:14.800
I was starting to get worried.

28:15.100 --> 28:18.900
I'm sorry. I forgot I had
my phone turned off from the flight.

28:19.100 --> 28:23.000
Well, I'm just happy that you got
there safely. So, how's it going?

28:23.300 --> 28:28.800
Great. Well, the food's not so hot,
but my room is huge.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.900
Well, that's very cool,
but how's the ballet?

28:31.100 --> 28:33.400
I mean, is it as good as they promised?

28:33.500 --> 28:34.900
Too soon to tell.

28:35.000 --> 28:39.000
Hey, listen, sweetie, it's almost
time for my flight to take off,

28:39.100 --> 28:42.200
but I will call you
as soon as I can, okay?

28:42.300 --> 28:44.600
I miss you so much already.

28:44.700 --> 28:48.900
E- mail me lots of pictures.
And Peyton, I love you.

28:49.100 --> 28:51.400
I love you, too. Bye.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.200
Is there a ballet school close by?

29:04.800 --> 29:05.900
Spike?

29:06.700 --> 29:11.200
Why is my dog in a dress
with pink nail polish?

29:11.300 --> 29:13.400
<i>He's learning Swan Lake.</i>

29:15.400 --> 29:17.600
Do you know how to fix
a ballerina bun?

29:17.700 --> 29:21.200
Do I look like I know
how to fix a ballerina bun?

29:29.400 --> 29:33.000
My mom says we're not supposed to
pop our knuckles.

29:33.100 --> 29:35.400
Well, your mom
didn't sleep on a hard sofa

29:35.500 --> 29:39.500
instead of her specially designed
$ 10,000 orthopedic bed

29:39.700 --> 29:44.000
made by Dr. Johan Gustavo,
of Switzerland.

29:47.600 --> 29:52.000
- What's... What's with the Beethoven?
- It's Tchaikovsky.

29:52.100 --> 29:54.400
- Do you listen to this every morning?
- No.

29:54.500 --> 29:57.500
Sometimes I listen to Bach,
or Rachmaninoff...

30:00.900 --> 30:02.500
Do you have an iPod?

30:03.100 --> 30:06.300
Because I'm going to buy you one.
Immediately. Right now.

30:06.400 --> 30:08.400
I'm going to buy you an iPod.

30:10.500 --> 30:12.000
Until then...

30:12.100 --> 30:13.500
Whoa...

30:16.100 --> 30:17.700
What is this?

30:17.800 --> 30:21.900
My Bedazzler.
Doesn't Camille look pretty?

30:22.000 --> 30:23.200
A Bedazzler?

30:25.400 --> 30:30.500
And that's why I use
tuna for protein and flavor.

30:30.700 --> 30:31.700
Mmm.

30:31.800 --> 30:34.600
- Gross.
- Little liquid chickens.

30:38.700 --> 30:40.800
Yeah, that's my favorite.

30:41.400 --> 30:42.900
Joe's juice.

30:45.400 --> 30:46.800
Okay. That's enough.

30:47.400 --> 30:48.400
I'm gonna need you to drink up.

30:48.500 --> 30:51.800
You'll be running the 40
in under 4.5 in no time.

30:54.200 --> 30:56.600
That smells worse than school food.

30:56.700 --> 30:59.800
You know, speaking of school,
why aren't you in it?

31:00.800 --> 31:04.000
- I'm on break.
- In January? No you're not.

31:04.100 --> 31:08.500
Yes, I am. I go to a magnet school,
so I have January off.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.300
Really? Well, guess what?
I'm not on break.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.700
As a matter of fact,
I'm on the opposite of break.

31:12.800 --> 31:13.900
So I'm gonna need you
to come over here,

31:14.100 --> 31:15.800
put some hustle in it,
and drink your breakfast.

31:15.900 --> 31:17.400
- Peyton, stop messing around.
- What?

31:17.500 --> 31:18.400
Peyton!

31:18.600 --> 31:19.500
No!

31:31.800 --> 31:32.800
Nice.

31:33.900 --> 31:35.500
That's real nice.

31:45.400 --> 31:49.500
- You know what a playbook is?
- I'm guessing it's a book with plays?

31:51.500 --> 31:55.400
Oh, I get it. The Xs are for kisses
and the Os for hugs.

31:55.500 --> 31:58.600
Wrong! The X's mean
"stay out of these areas of the house. "

31:58.700 --> 32:00.300
The O's mean "open access. "

32:00.400 --> 32:03.500
For example, you want to go
to the kitchen, straight buttonhook.

32:03.600 --> 32:06.400
But now you go to the kitchen, big X.

32:06.500 --> 32:08.600
Off limits. No access.

32:08.700 --> 32:11.400
Can't go there, because you made
a mess in the kitchen.

32:11.500 --> 32:12.800
Do you understand?

32:12.900 --> 32:15.400
No trick plays, no flea-flickers. Got it?

32:15.500 --> 32:17.100
Got it. No flea-flickers.

32:17.300 --> 32:19.700
This is your game plan.
Learn it. Live it. Love it.

32:23.500 --> 32:25.900
That's it, boys.
Practice is over.

32:29.300 --> 32:30.900
Pick a nanny, Joe.

32:32.600 --> 32:34.500
- I'll take the one at...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:34.900 --> 32:38.200
Don't you think
you should ask some questions first?

32:38.700 --> 32:40.600
I've got great instincts.

32:42.200 --> 32:44.500
The one on the end, Stella.

32:44.600 --> 32:45.700
Edna.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.900
The other end, Stella.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.600
Blondie, you're up.

32:57.500 --> 32:59.400
Oh, no. No.

33:03.700 --> 33:05.400
The King picked me!

33:08.100 --> 33:11.700
We are going to be just like sisters!

33:12.200 --> 33:13.600
Oh, my goodness.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
You start tomorrow.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.900
Hey. You're going
to the opening tonight, right?

33:22.100 --> 33:23.900
It's my restaurant.

33:24.300 --> 33:25.400
Oh.

33:26.900 --> 33:29.400
Well, what are you
going to do with her?

33:34.200 --> 33:35.500
I don't know.

33:41.700 --> 33:44.300
Hi. Hello.

33:49.300 --> 33:50.800
Welcome, Mr. Kingman.

33:52.200 --> 33:54.300
- The Maloofs!
- About time, there, Joe.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.700
You made it. Have fun.

33:55.800 --> 33:56.700
- Yeah.
- Enjoy yourself.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.400
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey, man.

34:01.500 --> 34:02.700
- How you doing?
- Hey.

34:02.800 --> 34:05.000
- Jo Jo!
- Hey, nice to see you.

34:05.700 --> 34:07.800
Hey, everything's on Joe tonight.

34:09.300 --> 34:11.600
And that's exactly what I said.
I told them.

34:11.699 --> 34:13.500
I said, "Listen, I'm the greatest. "

34:15.000 --> 34:17.300
The purple or the yellow?

34:18.800 --> 34:19.800
Hmm.

34:23.500 --> 34:24.400
Mmm?

34:26.000 --> 34:27.100
Mmm.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.800
That's what I was thinking, too.

34:37.500 --> 34:38.699
I'll be back.

34:42.100 --> 34:43.900
Water the lawn. Water the lawn.

34:44.500 --> 34:46.199
Hey, great night, Mr. Kingman.

34:46.300 --> 34:48.600
Indeed it was, Jay. Indeed it was.

34:48.699 --> 34:50.600
Hey, Joe! This way!

34:50.699 --> 34:54.000
Number one on the field
and number one in your heart.

34:58.900 --> 35:02.800
<i>I've got sunshine</i>

35:02.900 --> 35:05.900
<i>On a cloudy day</i>

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
Yes, I do.

35:08.700 --> 35:12.500
<i>When it's cold outside</i>

35:12.600 --> 35:16.700
<i>I've got the month of May</i>

35:18.200 --> 35:21.900
<i>I guess you'd say</i>

35:22.700 --> 35:23.800
<i>What can make me</i>

35:23.900 --> 35:24.900
<i>What can make me</i>

35:25.000 --> 35:27.100
<i>feel this way</i>

35:27.200 --> 35:28.200
<i>My girl</i>

35:28.300 --> 35:29.300
Joe?

35:30.000 --> 35:31.200
<i>My girl</i>

35:31.300 --> 35:33.700
<i>Talking about my girl</i>

35:33.800 --> 35:35.800
My girl... Peyton!

35:41.600 --> 35:42.800
Joe?

35:43.600 --> 35:46.100
Joe. Joe, where are you?

35:47.800 --> 35:51.000
There you are.
Joe, I thought you forgot about me.

35:51.100 --> 35:54.000
Peyton! Peyton! Peyton!

35:54.100 --> 35:55.700
Hey, Joe, is that your daughter?
- Peyton!

35:55.800 --> 35:57.600
Hey, Joe, you forget something?

35:57.700 --> 35:59.100
Father of the year!

36:03.800 --> 36:06.800
Yesterday, Fanny's Burgers
agreed to hand out

36:06.900 --> 36:09.700
your action figure
with every order of fries.

36:09.800 --> 36:11.700
But do you think
they're going to want a spokesman

36:11.800 --> 36:14.800
who forgot his child in a bar?

36:14.900 --> 36:15.900
Hmm?

36:16.000 --> 36:19.700
My mom says that Fanny's
makes kids fat and gives them gas.

36:20.400 --> 36:25.300
Well, your daddy's agent says
Fanny's makes him fat with cash.

36:26.200 --> 36:29.400
Now, I have to put together
a press conference, do some cleanup.

36:29.500 --> 36:32.700
I'm the janitor, Joe's the mop,
and Peyton's the mess.

36:37.600 --> 36:38.700
What?

36:40.400 --> 36:42.800
- Something funny, Larry?
- Just a little throat tickle, sir.

36:42.900 --> 36:44.700
Well, get it fixed.

36:44.800 --> 36:46.800
Right here. Chop-chop.

36:49.800 --> 36:51.300
You got a station wagon, Stella?

36:51.400 --> 36:53.700
No, you did.

36:54.700 --> 36:58.200
Say "bye-bye" to being
the Big Bad Dad of Boston.

37:04.900 --> 37:06.100
Oh, no.

37:07.400 --> 37:08.700
Oh, yes.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
You want me to sign that?

37:16.000 --> 37:21.200
Peyton, sweetie, be a good girl
and cooperate with your daddy

37:21.400 --> 37:25.100
and Auntie Stella will get you a nice
new BlackBerry with a Bluetooth.

37:28.700 --> 37:31.500
And an upgrade
on your next international flight.

37:31.600 --> 37:32.700
I'm eight.

37:33.300 --> 37:35.200
Listen, Bratty McPain-in-the-Butt,

37:35.300 --> 37:37.600
you will do whatever it takes
to help your father.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.900
I'll pay for the therapy.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.400
Listen, Peyton,
what Stella's trying to say here is

37:46.500 --> 37:48.000
this right now is crunch time.

37:48.100 --> 37:49.800
So, if something's bothering you,
then all you got to do...

37:49.900 --> 37:52.600
Let's keep it bottled up
until after the playoffs.

37:52.700 --> 37:53.700
Fine.

37:55.300 --> 37:56.900
On one condition.

37:57.800 --> 37:58.900
No nanny.

38:00.100 --> 38:01.400
No way.

38:06.700 --> 38:08.100
Hey...

38:08.200 --> 38:12.200
- Let's go. Come on.
- I'm feeling a little dizzy, Joe.

38:12.700 --> 38:14.400
Everything's all...

38:16.300 --> 38:17.900
- Dizzy?
- I think it might be

38:18.000 --> 38:22.400
from that funny yellow soft drink
Joe gave me last night.

38:22.500 --> 38:24.600
What was it called again?

38:26.200 --> 38:27.900
Margarita?

38:28.300 --> 38:29.700
- You wouldn't.
- You wouldn't.

38:29.800 --> 38:31.500
Try me.

38:33.700 --> 38:36.200
Good morning, Joe. I'm ready to start!

38:36.300 --> 38:38.100
Hey, Cindy!

38:39.300 --> 38:40.700
You're fired.

38:42.300 --> 38:43.400
Bye.

38:45.600 --> 38:47.100
Joe! Joe!

38:47.200 --> 38:48.700
Hey, Joe,
how can you remember the plays

38:48.800 --> 38:50.300
when you can't remember
you have a daughter?

38:50.400 --> 38:54.500
Joe, what is an 8-year-old girl doing
in a nightclub at 3:00 in the morning?

38:55.400 --> 38:57.400
<i>Thank you. Thank you guys
so much for coming out.</i>

38:57.500 --> 38:59.000
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

38:59.100 --> 39:00.100
<i>thank you so much for coming.</i>

39:00.200 --> 39:02.400
<i>Great questions, by the way.
Thank you.</i>

39:03.700 --> 39:08.100
<i>As you all know by now,
I've recently learned I'm a father.</i>

39:09.000 --> 39:12.300
<i>And clearly,
I'm still getting the hang of things.</i>

39:14.200 --> 39:15.900
That's not an excuse, Joe.

39:17.700 --> 39:22.300
<i>But you better believe that Peyton's
nightclub evenings are behind her.</i>

39:22.400 --> 39:26.300
<i>Because from now on, we're both
going to be going to sleep early, right?</i>

39:27.600 --> 39:30.300
<i>Now, who's number one on the field
and number one in your heart?</i>

39:36.700 --> 39:38.000
<i>Let's go.</i>

39:39.200 --> 39:41.100
<i>Can I say something, please?</i>

39:41.200 --> 39:42.400
No. Let's go.

39:45.400 --> 39:47.800
<i>Hi, everybody, I'm Peyton,</i>

39:47.900 --> 39:51.000
<i>the one who'll be going to bed early
from now on.</i>

39:56.400 --> 40:00.200
<i>My dad didn't have much of
a heads-up on this whole father thing</i>

40:00.300 --> 40:04.100
<i>and he is still
getting the hang of things.</i>

40:04.200 --> 40:07.400
<i>But it's like everything else in his life.</i>

40:07.600 --> 40:09.300
<i>He never says "no. "</i>

40:09.700 --> 40:13.000
<i>I mean, he's teaching me
that you can do anything</i>

40:13.100 --> 40:16.800
<i>if you've got motivation
and determination.</i>

40:18.300 --> 40:20.700
<i>And the place where that starts</i>

40:22.600 --> 40:25.900
<i>is right here, in the heart.</i>

40:27.400 --> 40:29.900
<i>You're the world's greatest father.</i>

40:33.400 --> 40:34.800
That was good.

40:35.200 --> 40:38.400
- That was really good.
- It's going to cost you.

40:45.200 --> 40:48.800
...two, three, four, grand plié...

40:48.900 --> 40:50.900
There you go, there you go.

40:51.900 --> 40:53.000
And...

40:53.800 --> 40:56.300
Come on, this isn't a sport.

40:56.400 --> 40:58.700
Football. Football's a sport.

40:58.800 --> 41:01.400
Excuse me. Hi. Can I help you?

41:01.500 --> 41:03.300
Hello. This is Peyton.

41:04.100 --> 41:07.200
- Hi.
- And she's here for this.

41:07.900 --> 41:10.000
So, I guess I'll be back
in a couple of hours. Bye.

41:10.100 --> 41:12.100
Well, class started 15 minutes ago,

41:12.300 --> 41:14.300
and we don't accept students
without an audition

41:14.400 --> 41:17.400
and that happened last month,
so I'm really sorry.

41:19.100 --> 41:21.800
I'm sure maybe we can
work something out?

41:21.900 --> 41:24.200
Money's no object,
as you probably know.

41:25.100 --> 41:28.900
Okay, the thing is
that this is a professional school, and...

41:31.400 --> 41:32.900
- That's very nice.
- Thank you.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.600
Go change, go on, go change.

41:34.700 --> 41:36.600
Let me see how she does today. Okay?

41:36.700 --> 41:38.100
All right.

41:49.600 --> 41:51.900
Maybe I'll... I'll try and...
We'll get somebody...

41:52.000 --> 41:54.300
The moms sit over there.

41:55.500 --> 41:57.400
Excuse me. Thank you.

42:05.600 --> 42:08.900
And one, two, three, very long...

42:09.500 --> 42:10.900
Come on, come on.

42:11.000 --> 42:15.400
And one, two, three, four.

42:15.500 --> 42:18.300
Open up, like a princess, chin up.

42:18.400 --> 42:19.700
Thank you.

42:19.800 --> 42:21.100
Beautiful class, everybody. Beautiful.

42:22.400 --> 42:24.800
Peyton, come here.
Can I tell you that that was so, so good.

42:24.800 --> 42:27.300
Peyton, come here.
Can I tell you that that was so, so good.

42:27.400 --> 42:28.300
Thank you.

42:28.400 --> 42:30.500
Our next big performance
is in three weeks.

42:30.600 --> 42:34.600
But if you promise me that you're going
to work extra, extra, super, super, hard,

42:34.700 --> 42:36.100
we'd love to have you.

42:36.200 --> 42:40.100
- I'll come every single day.
- All day, every day.

42:40.200 --> 42:43.300
Well, it is a ballet school,
not a childcare facility.

42:43.400 --> 42:45.200
And when we make a commitment
to a student,

42:45.300 --> 42:47.700
we ask that the parents
make a commitment to the school.

42:47.800 --> 42:48.800
Can you do that?

42:48.900 --> 42:51.800
Well, I think you can make
a little exception for me.

42:51.900 --> 42:54.800
- And why is that?
- You don't know who I am?

42:55.900 --> 42:56.900
No.

42:58.100 --> 43:01.700
I'm Joe Kingman, baby!
The quarterback of the Boston Rebels.

43:01.800 --> 43:03.000
Number one on that field

43:03.100 --> 43:06.700
and number one
in your pretty little heart.

43:06.800 --> 43:09.200
"The King of the Gridiron. "

43:09.300 --> 43:11.200
"Never-Say-No Joe?"

43:13.700 --> 43:15.800
No? Nothing?

43:17.700 --> 43:18.800
Odd.

43:18.900 --> 43:22.300
- Well, don't you know who I am?
- No.

43:22.400 --> 43:25.700
I'm Monique Vasquez,
the lady with the ballet school,

43:25.800 --> 43:28.200
the one that doesn't accept
any new students full-time

43:28.300 --> 43:32.300
unless she knows for a fact
that the parents are going to help out.

43:33.500 --> 43:37.200
That's fine. Fine. I promise. Whatever.
Let's go.

43:38.400 --> 43:39.900
Who doesn't know
who Joe Kingman is?

43:40.000 --> 43:42.100
She must be living under a rock.

43:42.300 --> 43:43.600
<i>Raef will take it this time.
- He shoots! Come on!</i>

43:43.700 --> 43:44.800
<i>- Got it.
- Yeah!</i>

43:46.000 --> 43:47.100
<i>I didn't see what happened
to Paul Pierce.</i>

43:47.300 --> 43:48.200
<i>We'll be right back</i>

43:48.300 --> 43:49.300
<i>- after a word from our...
- Let's go, Paul!</i>

43:49.400 --> 43:51.400
I can't believe they came from 10 down.

43:51.500 --> 43:54.900
Hey, keep this clean. Use the napkins.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.600
Don't look at me like that.
Use a napkin.

43:57.700 --> 44:00.900
Yeah, you tell him. You tell him, Spike.
Mean old Daddy.

44:01.100 --> 44:02.700
Let's get Webber.

44:09.700 --> 44:12.900
Webber, you want a soda?

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
Huh?

44:14.100 --> 44:15.800
Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.300
Oh...

44:24.600 --> 44:27.200
- That's refreshing.
- Good one.

44:27.300 --> 44:28.700
What's up, Joe?

44:28.800 --> 44:30.900
I don't know, Coop. What do you think?
That's a $40,000 couch.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
I asked you to be careful!

44:33.200 --> 44:35.900
- Which bathroom should I use?
- The one off the trophy room.

44:37.700 --> 44:38.700
Come on, Pierce!

44:38.800 --> 44:41.000
Paul Pierce comes down
with the board.

44:41.100 --> 44:43.500
The man's a beast.
You saw that, Joe. You saw that.

44:43.600 --> 44:45.300
That's why the Celtics
are my team for life.

44:45.400 --> 44:46.700
Celtics got this one locked up.

44:46.800 --> 44:48.300
Hold on, hold on...

44:51.600 --> 44:54.700
Wait a second. Wait a minute.
Little bit more.

44:57.200 --> 45:00.700
Stop growling. Hold on.
One, two, three.

45:07.100 --> 45:08.600
What did I do?

45:08.700 --> 45:10.100
Let's go, Paul Pierce.
Time to come through.

45:10.200 --> 45:13.300
- Okay, here we go, baby. Here we go.
- Three seconds left.

45:15.400 --> 45:17.300
<i>Welcome to
the Magical World of Ponies.</i>

45:17.500 --> 45:18.700
What happened?

45:21.500 --> 45:23.100
Get it back! Get it back!
Get the game back!

45:23.200 --> 45:24.300
Get the mechanicals!

45:24.400 --> 45:26.700
The mechanicals.
The mechanicals, Joe!

45:30.400 --> 45:32.600
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying! I'm trying!

45:32.700 --> 45:34.300
It's right there. See?

45:34.400 --> 45:35.400
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

45:36.700 --> 45:38.300
We missed it!

45:38.500 --> 45:40.800
<i>- You gotta celebrate.
- Peyton.</i>

45:45.100 --> 45:46.500
What did I do?

45:46.600 --> 45:49.600
Thanks, Joe. Let's go, guys.

45:49.700 --> 45:51.900
Wait. Where are you going?

45:52.600 --> 45:55.100
You don't have to leave.
Where are you guys going?

45:55.200 --> 45:56.900
- I got to get home to...
- Where?

45:57.000 --> 45:57.900
Nothing.

46:01.100 --> 46:03.100
What did I tell you
about touching the remote?

46:03.200 --> 46:05.400
Bath. Bed. Now.

46:05.500 --> 46:08.800
Just got to add a little bit
of bubble bath.

46:09.100 --> 46:12.100
Not too much. That's good.

46:13.700 --> 46:14.700
Perfect.

46:17.800 --> 46:19.800
This could take a while.

46:27.900 --> 46:30.700
<i>But what really sets
this future Hall of Famer apart...</i>

46:30.800 --> 46:31.900
Passion for the game.

46:33.100 --> 46:36.000
Spike, you know the rule,
no barking when I'm on TV!

46:36.100 --> 46:37.200
Spike!

46:38.400 --> 46:39.500
Spike?

46:40.400 --> 46:41.900
What happened?

46:43.400 --> 46:44.400
Spike.

46:45.400 --> 46:46.600
Peyton?

46:47.200 --> 46:48.700
Peyton! Peyton!

46:52.500 --> 46:53.500
Peyton!

47:19.500 --> 47:21.500
I'm not going to yell.

47:21.600 --> 47:23.600
We're going to have a very calm

47:25.300 --> 47:27.300
And rational discussion

47:28.500 --> 47:30.300
about all...

47:35.900 --> 47:39.900
You Bedazzled my football.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.700
You guys comfortable? My pillow.

48:05.100 --> 48:07.700
King on the couch!

48:13.600 --> 48:15.000
This is ridiculous.

48:19.400 --> 48:21.100
Never

48:21.200 --> 48:22.700
say...

48:24.000 --> 48:25.800
No! No!

48:25.900 --> 48:27.500
I have to warm up.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.100
I have to practice.

48:34.800 --> 48:37.300
I have a playoff game this weekend.

48:37.400 --> 48:40.000
Do you...
Do you know what that means?

48:41.400 --> 48:45.300
My guess is that it means
you have a playoff game this weekend.

48:47.400 --> 48:51.200
My dog, my bed, my car, my TV,
my stereo...

48:51.300 --> 48:52.900
Is nothing sacred?

48:56.200 --> 48:59.000
My towel! My towel.

48:59.700 --> 49:02.200
This is all mine! It's all me!

49:02.300 --> 49:05.400
It's all mine! This is all me!
This is my towel.

49:05.700 --> 49:08.400
<i>Hi, everybody, I'm Marv Albert,
along with Boomer Esiason.</i>

49:08.500 --> 49:12.200
<i>We're here in the Mile High City
where Denver hosts Boston</i>

49:12.300 --> 49:14.500
<i>in the first round of the playoffs.</i>

49:14.600 --> 49:16.600
In what should be
a tremendous showdown.

49:16.700 --> 49:18.900
<i>We have a rematch
of last year's Conference Final</i>

49:19.000 --> 49:22.500
<i>in which Denver narrowly escaped
with a 34-30 victory.</i>

49:22.600 --> 49:25.200
<i>He has the tight end screen,
he side-arms it.</i>

49:25.300 --> 49:27.100
<i>The catch made by Cooper.</i>

49:27.200 --> 49:29.800
<i>Cooper on the run, picks up a blocker.</i>

49:31.200 --> 49:33.300
<i>And now, directing traffic...</i>

49:33.500 --> 49:36.200
<i>Nice cut. Cooper down the sideline!</i>

49:36.500 --> 49:37.600
<i>And he's bounced out of bounds!</i>

49:38.800 --> 49:40.600
Yeah! I did it again!

49:40.700 --> 49:42.500
Oh, our boy looks great today.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.900
He's going to look even greater
lounging poolside

49:45.000 --> 49:46.100
at the new Blake resort.

49:46.200 --> 49:49.600
Let's just see how many Fanny's
kiddie meals he sells first.

49:50.200 --> 49:51.300
Fanny.

49:54.500 --> 49:57.200
Do you work at Fanny's Burgers?

49:57.300 --> 49:59.800
I own Fanny's Burgers, honey.

49:59.900 --> 50:00.900
My mom says...

50:03.300 --> 50:09.500
I mean, my dad says
your chili cheese fries rock.

50:09.600 --> 50:12.900
Yeah, they do! They rock. Come on!
Kick it!

50:14.800 --> 50:16.800
<i>Kingman out of the gun,
takes a look.</i>

50:16.900 --> 50:20.700
<i>He has Sanders wide open.
He's not going that way.</i>

50:20.800 --> 50:22.400
<i>Marv, I've never
seen a quarterback</i>

50:22.500 --> 50:24.100
<i>who doesn't trust his wide receivers</i>

50:24.200 --> 50:25.600
<i>with a game on the line like this.</i>

50:25.700 --> 50:27.600
<i>Touchdown! It's all over!</i>

50:27.700 --> 50:29.800
<i>Boston has defeated Denver.</i>

50:29.900 --> 50:30.900
<i>All on the legs of Joe Kingman,</i>

50:32.100 --> 50:34.800
Boston advances
to next week's divisional playoffs

50:34.900 --> 50:36.000
for the second year in a row.

50:36.100 --> 50:39.000
Now, will this be the year the King
takes them all the way?

50:50.300 --> 50:52.700
Peyton, are you okay?
Why are you still here?

50:52.800 --> 50:55.900
I guess Joe's running a little bit late
from practice.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.400
What, two hours late?
That's unacceptable.

50:58.500 --> 51:00.100
Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

51:00.800 --> 51:01.800
Hey, King.

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
No, I'm the king. You're the king.

51:04.100 --> 51:06.100
Don't do it, Elvis!
Don't jump.

51:07.600 --> 51:09.100
Mr. Kingman?

51:10.500 --> 51:12.000
Oh, no. Peyton.

51:13.500 --> 51:14.400
Hey.

51:14.600 --> 51:18.500
Yeah, I guess practice ran a little
longer than expected. Thanks, Bo.

51:18.600 --> 51:20.700
- Mr. Kingman, we need to talk about...
- You know what?

51:20.800 --> 51:23.600
Why don't you just call me Joe?

51:25.300 --> 51:26.400
Stop it. Stop it.

51:26.500 --> 51:29.600
Mr. Kingman,
I informed you from the start

51:29.700 --> 51:32.000
that we are a ballet school,
not a daycare center.

51:32.100 --> 51:34.400
Yeah! I got that. Mental note.

51:34.500 --> 51:38.400
I'm glad you told me. Now I know.
Ballet school, not a daycare facility.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.500
Sure, let me hook you up
for your time, though.

51:40.600 --> 51:44.300
Peyton, go grab a hundo out of my bag.
It's in my wallet, around the corner.

51:46.200 --> 51:48.000
I just knew
you were one of those parents.

51:48.100 --> 51:49.100
One of what parents?

51:51.900 --> 51:56.400
The kind who thinks that his life is
more important than anybody else's.

51:56.500 --> 51:59.000
Look, lady.
I don't know what kind of parent I am.

51:59.100 --> 52:01.000
All I know is I have an entire team...

52:01.100 --> 52:04.300
Scratch that,
an entire city depending on me.

52:04.400 --> 52:06.700
Yeah, you also have a daughter
depending on you

52:06.800 --> 52:10.500
not to only take care of her,
but to care about her. Okay?

52:10.600 --> 52:13.000
- Listen, I care about Peyton.
- Then prove it!

52:13.100 --> 52:15.500
- I got it.
- Hey, sweetie!

52:15.600 --> 52:17.300
Your father here was telling me
how excited he is

52:17.400 --> 52:20.900
to finally fulfill the commitment
he made to support the school.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.900
And guess what?
I've got the perfect job for him.

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
Cool.

52:25.100 --> 52:28.300
No, no, no. Absolutely not.
You're completely insane.

52:29.400 --> 52:32.300
You're a freakishly large man

52:32.400 --> 52:35.800
and you're telling me you're incapable
of playing a tree? Come on.

52:35.900 --> 52:38.400
No, what I'm telling you is
I am a serious athlete.

52:38.500 --> 52:40.000
Not a ballerina.

52:40.400 --> 52:42.700
<i>You do me a favor, mamita?
Can you please hold this for me?</i>

52:42.800 --> 52:43.700
Thank you so much.

52:43.800 --> 52:47.000
Trust me, no one is ever going to
confuse you with a ballerina, okay?

52:47.100 --> 52:49.800
And now,
I need you to be an enchanted tree...

52:49.900 --> 52:51.700
I'm not going to be an enchanted tree.
I'm a quarterback!

52:51.800 --> 52:53.600
I'm the only one that talks.

53:20.100 --> 53:21.100
Up!

53:28.000 --> 53:30.200
...around and... Oh, my God, no, no...
Please, come over here.

53:31.400 --> 53:32.900
Wasn't so bad.

53:33.900 --> 53:36.300
We're just warming up, so come on.

53:50.500 --> 53:54.700
Hey, so what were you saying about
ballet not being a real sport?

53:56.400 --> 53:57.500
Hmm?

53:58.300 --> 54:00.300
It wasn't... It wasn't so bad.

54:01.500 --> 54:03.900
You see, ballerinas can leap
as high as you can,

54:04.000 --> 54:06.500
but when they go down,
they go down in plié.

54:06.600 --> 54:08.700
And they hold and hold.

54:08.800 --> 54:12.500
And then they go en pointe
for hours and hours.

54:12.600 --> 54:16.200
So, if ballet were easy,
they'd call it football.

54:18.800 --> 54:21.200
Yeah. Right.

54:21.300 --> 54:22.700
Yeah, right.

54:23.700 --> 54:25.200
Listen, Mr. Kingman,

54:25.300 --> 54:28.100
your daughter has all the makings
to be a professional dancer.

54:28.200 --> 54:31.100
She has passion, talent, discipline.

54:33.900 --> 54:36.900
I guess she inherited more
than just your charm.

54:41.600 --> 54:42.900
You see?

54:44.600 --> 54:46.000
Let's try that one again.

54:52.900 --> 54:55.300
Where were you last night?
You missed a great fight.

54:55.400 --> 54:56.800
Hey, man,
you look like you were in a fight.

54:56.900 --> 54:59.000
I was doing some stuff.

54:59.400 --> 55:01.900
Well, you could've called.
You never call anymore.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.200
Dude, stop being such a chick.

55:06.400 --> 55:08.200
Never thought someone so little
could be so much work, huh?

55:08.400 --> 55:09.800
You don't know the half of it.

55:18.800 --> 55:20.500
<i>- Hello?
Hi!</i>

55:21.100 --> 55:24.700
Listen, I finally got to a phone.
I want you to tell me everything.

55:25.200 --> 55:26.500
I don't know where to start.

55:26.600 --> 55:28.600
How about those pictures
you promised me?

55:28.700 --> 55:30.500
E- mail me right now.

55:30.600 --> 55:31.700
I have to see you.

55:31.800 --> 55:33.100
Okay, hold on.

55:36.900 --> 55:38.600
I just sent them.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.300
You're breaking up. I love you.

55:40.400 --> 55:43.000
Wait, wait. No, no, Peyton! Honey...

55:44.000 --> 55:45.600
I love you, too.

55:49.900 --> 55:52.100
We need to talk. Follow me.

55:57.400 --> 55:59.100
I need my bed back.

56:03.800 --> 56:08.200
Wow! That is awesome! I love it!

56:09.400 --> 56:13.500
Love it. I love this room.
This is awesome.

56:17.400 --> 56:18.900
It's beautiful.

56:20.100 --> 56:22.300
- Thanks, Joe.
- You're welcome.

56:23.800 --> 56:28.600
Look, P, you know the whole
"playbook for the house" thing?

56:28.700 --> 56:31.000
No more buttonhooks in the kitchen.

56:31.100 --> 56:32.800
Right. No more buttonhooks.

56:32.900 --> 56:35.600
You see, the quarterback
is supposed to know the playbook

56:35.700 --> 56:37.200
better than anybody.

56:38.300 --> 56:42.400
But you and I,
you've been playing kid your entire life.

56:43.200 --> 56:46.100
I just joined the dad team,
and I'm still learning all these plays.

56:46.200 --> 56:47.500
No kidding.

56:48.500 --> 56:50.300
All right.

56:50.400 --> 56:53.100
Listen, sometimes a quarterback
has got to think on his feet

56:53.200 --> 56:55.800
and call an audible, okay? And...

56:57.800 --> 56:59.200
Here, this.

57:01.200 --> 57:03.100
When the linebackers
are creeping up to blitz

57:04.400 --> 57:05.800
And all of a sudden
you've got to call an audible

57:05.900 --> 57:07.900
to change the play,
and you go around and you score!

57:09.200 --> 57:10.600
He scores.

57:14.600 --> 57:18.100
All right, it's kind of like, just like in life.

57:18.800 --> 57:21.500
Sometimes things
get thrown at you unexpectedly.

57:21.700 --> 57:23.900
Then you got to call an audible.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
You got to learn on the go.

57:28.500 --> 57:31.600
- Just like us. Okay?
- Okay.

57:36.300 --> 57:39.200
<i>Number one on the field,
and number one in your heart.</i>

57:39.300 --> 57:42.000
<i>- Now, number one on your toothbrush.
- That's funny.</i>

57:42.100 --> 57:43.900
My teeth are really white.

57:45.000 --> 57:46.000
Ding!

57:46.200 --> 57:47.600
That's ridiculous.

57:48.100 --> 57:50.100
No, that's not. That's awesome.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.800
- Joe?
- Yeah?

57:58.800 --> 58:02.000
What's the best thing
that's ever happened to you?

58:06.500 --> 58:07.600
Well, I...

58:08.800 --> 58:11.400
<i>You have one incoming message.</i>

58:11.900 --> 58:14.100
Hold that question, all right?

58:16.200 --> 58:18.700
<i>This is the King. Do your thing.</i>

58:19.000 --> 58:23.500
<i>Hey, baby, it's Tatianna.
I'm in Boston. I be there 6:00.</i>

58:25.600 --> 58:26.800
Tatianna!

58:28.100 --> 58:31.900
Tatianna's coming at 6:00.
I got plenty of time! It's 5:45!

58:32.400 --> 58:33.800
Who's Tatianna?

58:35.500 --> 58:37.200
I got 15 minutes.

58:39.200 --> 58:41.700
- Who's Tatianna?
- 5:45. 5:45. 5:45.

58:41.800 --> 58:44.700
Listen, she's a friend.
I'm gonna need you to clean up all this.

58:44.800 --> 58:48.700
Take all this, take it down, and...
Hide it in your room.

58:48.800 --> 58:49.800
And you go, too.

58:49.900 --> 58:52.800
And you play hide-and-seek with that,
and just make sure they're all gone.

59:02.400 --> 59:04.100
Is Tatianna your girlfriend?

59:06.300 --> 59:07.800
Do you mind?

59:18.000 --> 59:20.700
No, no, no, no, maybe, yes.

59:24.600 --> 59:29.900
Hi, you must be Melanie.
Joe has told me so much about you!

59:30.000 --> 59:33.800
- I'm Tatianna. What are you?
- Peyton. Joe's daughter.

59:34.500 --> 59:35.500
Joe's daughter?

59:35.700 --> 59:36.700
Mmm-hmm.

59:36.800 --> 59:40.100
- How old are you anyway, four?
- How old are you, 40?

59:40.200 --> 59:44.000
- I'm 21.
- Are you Joe's long-lost daughter, too?

59:44.100 --> 59:45.100
Joe!

59:46.300 --> 59:49.500
<i>Bonsoir, Tatianna.
Baby, welcome back!</i>

59:49.600 --> 59:53.100
<i>You look très... Gorgeous!</i>

59:53.700 --> 59:56.900
- I know.
- I see you've already met...

59:59.800 --> 01:00:00.900
Peyton.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Peyton, yes.
I don't know what she's told you.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:06.300
'Cause she has
such a wild imagination.

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.800
Either way,
we have a lot to discuss over dinner.

01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:11.200
Where are we eating?

01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:14.300
You are going to eat
over at the Jensens', across the hall.

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:18.600
It's just like a restaurant over there.
Only not so much.

01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:24.500
We going to miss you
at dinner tonight.

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:29.700
It was a shock at first,
but nothing's changed.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:31.500
Nothing's changed.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.200
Is your coat Bedazzled?

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:39.900
Peyton.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.400
Wait a minute.

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:45.100
I'm still Joe.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.300
Still the king.

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.200
You drive station wagon.

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:56.500
What? A station wagon?
That's not my car.

01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:59.600
Somebody's fired.
I'm Joe Kingman and somebody's fired.

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:05.700
- Mr. Kingman, wait! Mr. Kingman.
- What?

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:09.200
I'm sorry, but I guess Peyton's
allergic to our dog.

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:13.000
Oh, she's allergic to the dog.
She's allergic to the dog.

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:15.600
Oh, really?
Well you're not allergic to Spike.

01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:18.700
Excuse me.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.100
- Bed. Now.
- I'm not even tired.

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:27.200
- Well, I am. Go to bed.
- To think you walked out on my mom

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:29.900
just to hang around
with the sorry likes of that.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.800
What did you just say?

01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:33.800
- To think you walked out...
- I didn't walk out on your mom.

01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:35.400
She walked out on me.

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:36.900
Oh, really?

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.200
Because she said
you were self-centered. And selfish.

01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:43.200
And that everything
always had to be about you.

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:45.000
She said your head was so swollen,

01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:48.600
she was surprised
they made a helmet big enough to fit.

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:51.300
- She said that?
- And more.

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.400
You know, it's all coming back to me.

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.400
Of course. Everything.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:02.000
All the talking and the arguing
and the complaining.

01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:04.800
And you know what?
You're just like her!

01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:06.000
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:07.900
You think you're right about everything!

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.400
- Just like her!
- What else?

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:13.800
You scrunch your nose
when you get angry just like her!

01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:15.100
Keep it coming.

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:19.000
You're always working on me
with those big brown eyes...

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.800
Well, I actually like that, it's really cute.

01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:24.800
But it doesn't matter,
because it's just like her!

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:25.900
Is that all you got?

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.800
And then you get inside
people's minds,

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:29.700
and you drive them crazy!

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.000
Just like her!

01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:36.100
Well, at least I got a mind,
because if I didn't, I'd be just like you!

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:40.400
Well, I'm lucky, because as far as
I'm concerned, you are nothing like me!

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:44.800
- Good! Because I am sick of it here.
- What do you want from me?

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:50.900
Don't turn your back on me, little lady.
Tell me what you want!

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.300
My mom!

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.700
Hey, open the door.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Thanks a lot, Spike.

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:28.200
Traitor.

01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:38.400
Any advice?

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:44.200
<i>Are you lonesome tonight</i>

01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:48.900
<i>Do you miss me tonight</i>

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:55.900
<i>Are you sorry we drifted apart</i>

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:03.400
<i>Does your memory stray</i>

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:07.500
<i>To a bright sunny day</i>

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:10.000
<i>When I kissed you</i>

01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:14.800
<i>and called you sweetheart</i>

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:22.100
<i>I wonder why I am</i>

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:26.600
<i>Singing this for</i>

01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:31.100
<i>When you will not even</i>

01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:35.900
<i>Open the door</i>

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:38.700
I don't want to see you.

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:42.100
Well, how about you open the door
with your eyes closed?

01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:49.000
See, that wasn't so bad.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:54.300
<i>Is your heart filled with pain</i>

01:04:55.100 --> 01:05:00.000
<i>Shall I come back again</i>

01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:02.400
<i>Tell me dear</i>

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:07.100
<i>Are you lonesome tonight</i>

01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:14.800
<i>Won't you open your eyes</i>

01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:19.700
<i>Give your dad a surprise</i>

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:23.100
<i>Tell me Peyton</i>

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:29.400
<i>Are you lonesome tonight</i>

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:34.400
There they are. Big and brown.

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:37.100
Do I really have my mommy's eyes?

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:40.300
Yeah. You bet.

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:44.100
You also have
her crazy long eyelashes, too.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.000
And every time you bat those things,
there's a huge hurricane in Hawaii.

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:53.600
See, look at that.
Three houses just blew away on Oahu.

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:55.400
It's on the news.

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:59.300
My mom said she fell in love with you
because of your guitar playing.

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:01.900
That you sounded just like Elvis.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.800
- Well, what do you think?
- I think she was tone-deaf

01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:09.000
and you sound more like
a wounded moose than the King.

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:10.300
A wounded moose?

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.500
Mmm-hmm.

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:12.600
Like...

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:16.300
Like that?

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:20.300
There's that smile
I've been waiting for.

01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:25.000
I would do anything to
keep that beautiful smile on your face.

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:27.700
Anything?

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:31.700
Quiet!

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:34.000
Quiet! I said quiet!

01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:35.300
Let's go!

01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:38.600
Everybody, I need a tight
formation, right now, in front.

01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:41.000
Tight formation, everybody.
Calling an audible.

01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:42.600
Fifty-nine razor. What would...

01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:45.600
I am serious! Everybody huddle up...

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:49.600
Little girls don't speak "football," Joe.

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:51.200
Hey, I didn't say break.

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:52.600
You call your dad Joe?

01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:53.700
Hmm.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.100
Come here.
What am I, two feet tall? Peyton!

01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:02.600
Watch out!
Watch my legs, I got million-dollar legs.

01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:04.900
What's that number?

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.900
Get out of here! You're in my way!

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:12.100
My legs! I got to play on Sunday.
Hello? I need help. I need help!

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:16.600
Get off me! Everybody off...
Me first! Me first!

01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:22.200
Excuse me.
- I'm world-famous. I'm a celebrity.

01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:34.800
Maybe a smidgen of the cream.

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:39.900
Very good tea.
Would you like a little bit of tea?

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.500
- Thank you for saving me.
- You're welcome.

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:55.700
Totally out of my league.
Only mothers can do this stuff.

01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:57.000
Not necessarily.

01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:00.200
I mean, it's true
that mothers are definitely smarter

01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:02.300
and kinder and funnier,

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:05.900
and for the most part
better at everything.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.200
But can I tell you something?

01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:10.200
I wouldn't underestimate
the power of the father.

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:13.200
- The power of the father.
- Sure.

01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:16.700
Dads are great for picking you up
and dusting you off.

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:17.399
They give you the courage to do things

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:18.100
They give you the courage to do things

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:20.100
that you never thought you could.

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:23.100
My father took me
to my first ballet class.

01:08:24.899 --> 01:08:26.600
Lucky for us he did.

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:34.600
What?

01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:36.200
Nothing.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.300
Do we have any product for this?

01:08:39.399 --> 01:08:42.200
My doll has hair plugs for some reason.

01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:46.000
Joe, they've got Camille
fingernail polish!

01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:47.800
- No way.
- Way!

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.899
Nice shade. What is that?
Powder-puff pink?

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:55.399
I got a question. Do your toes match?

01:08:56.700 --> 01:09:00.899
Hey. Hey, relax. Relax. Cut it out.
He can't help it.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.100
Somebody stole his man card.

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:08.800
All right, all right, all
right, all right. Listen up.

01:09:08.899 --> 01:09:12.899
Indianapolis claims that they're
going to send us on a long vacation.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.399
- But who's about to go fishing?
- They are!

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:17.600
- Who's about to hit the links?
- They are!

01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:20.800
- Who's going to win the championship?
- They are!

01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:24.500
- We are?
- We are!

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:26.100
- Ready!
- Break!

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:44.000
Your turn, little one.

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:58.100
I can't do it. I'm not big enough.
My shoulders aren't strong enough.

01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:04.000
Little one. You can do it.
Your strength is in here.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.500
- Are you ready?
- Okay.

01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:08.100
Let's do it.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.900
- There you go. You're doing it.
- Yeah, it's moving.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.100
Hey, Joe.

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:20.800
Attaway, P.

01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:27.900
And one. Higher.
Point those toes, please.

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:31.000
Everybody together. Much better.

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:33.400
No, no, no, no, no, no...

01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:36.300
Instinct.

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:39.200
And a three. And one...

01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:40.300
And...

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:44.900
Hey. You've got my time, cutie-pie.
Yeah...

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.700
<i>Boston Rebels. Catch the spirit.</i>

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:04.100
Hey, Peyton. Come here.
You are so busted! Get over here!

01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:07.500
- Hey...
- Get him!

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:08.700
Fire!

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:10.300
- Fire!
- Fire!

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:21.200
Good one.

01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:03.300
Boston beats Indianapolis.

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:06.200
The Rebels will advance on
to next Sunday's conference finals...

01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:09.700
Look at this. Look at this.
Artwork in the locker, huh?

01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:13.800
I definitely say
she's breached the final frontier.

01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:15.200
That's our game plan.

01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:17.400
See, I especially like the Xs and Os
down there.

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.800
Oh, no, those are hugs and kisses.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.900
Hugs and kisses. All right. All right.

01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:30.100
Is Spike wearing a tutu?

01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:32.800
No, no.

01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:37.800
No, that's one of those...
That's one of those doggy supports.

01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:44.100
Hey, P. P! Hey, P.

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:46.900
Give these to Monique, okay?
There she is.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:47.900
You good?

01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:50.200
Miss Monique. These are for you.

01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:55.800
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:58.300
- Are you ready for your big debut?
- Yeah.

01:12:58.400 --> 01:12:59.700
- There you go, P.
- Thank you.

01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:02.500
No, no, no. Joe. Joe, this is for you.

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:11.500
No. No, in case you forgot,
I'm a "freakishly" large man

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:13.700
and these are "freakishly" small tights.

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:16.200
Hurry up, offense. No huddle.

01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:17.700
- Hey, guys.
Let's go.

01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:19.900
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000
- Please. Get dressed.
- No, listen to me. There's no...

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.500
How's it going?

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:32.800
Full house.

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:34.900
- Oh, no.
- Hey.

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:39.100
You know, Joe, I'm not feeling so good.

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:42.700
We should just go home.
Yeah, let's go home.

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:46.900
Did I just hear the girl who forced me
to learn pirouettes give up?

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.400
But I didn't think there were
going to be so many people.

01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:53.000
You just have pre-game jitters,
that's all.

01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:55.000
All athletes have those.

01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:58.600
- Even me.
- You do?

01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:01.900
Come here, honey. Stand up.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.700
We've worked way too hard
to quit now.

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:08.100
I know.

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:16.700
All right, all right. All right.

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:22.700
Listen, I don't care how ridiculous
either of us looks out there, okay?

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:26.500
We're going to go out on the stage,
and we're going to dance our tutus off.

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:29.700
- Because my daughter's no quitter.
- No, she's not.

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:31.700
And she never says no.

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:34.200
Okay.

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:39.700
Excuse me, ma'am.
Have you seen Joe Kingman?

01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:43.900
Oh. Wait, no wait.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.600
That is the stupidest outfit
I've ever seen.

01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:50.900
Stupid is a mean word, Mr. Cooper.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.200
I didn't say "stupid. " I
said "stupidest. " Look it up.

01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:57.800
Hey, Sanders.
What are you guys doing here?

01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:00.000
What are we doing here?

01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:03.600
Joe, did you really think the team
was going to miss this?

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:08.500
Yeah, you should've said no, Joe.
You should've said no.

01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:11.000
Did you say "team"?

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:12.600
Hmm.

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:15.800
Joe.

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:20.000
- P.
- Monroe.

01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:21.100
Bye.

01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:23.400
Did you say "team"? Or...

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.900
Don't panic. No panic.

01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:34.800
Power of the father.
Power of the father.

01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:36.000
Power of the... You're panicking.

01:16:57.700 --> 01:16:58.900
- Wow.
- Look at that one.

01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:02.900
Wow. That's incredible.

01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:31.100
So

01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:33.200
beautiful.

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:38.300
- Bravo! Bravo!
- Bravo! Bravo!

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:48.200
Little one!

01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:04.700
<i>Well, Boomer,
after their impressive victory today</i>

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:07.600
<i>Joe Kingman and all of Boston
will finally get the chance</i>

01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:11.400
<i>at that coveted trophy, which has
eluded them for all these years.</i>

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:12.800
Aw, there's my number-one
quarterback.

01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:16.100
We did it! We're going!

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:18.000
You may be the world's
greatest football player,

01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:19.600
but I'm the world's greatest agent.

01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:20.900
What's up?

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.800
We're about to make
Tiger's endorsements

01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:25.000
look like minimum wage.

01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:29.300
All you have to do is,
A, win the championship game...

01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:30.400
Details.

01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:34.200
B, right after you win,
look straight into the camera

01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:37.700
and say,
"I'm going to Fanny's Burgers. "

01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:42.700
- That's it. An instant 25 million.
- Hamburger.

01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:47.800
Stella, for the record, Fanny's
makes kids fat and gives them gas.

01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:51.100
Zip it before I tie another one of
those things around your mouth.

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:53.200
"I'm going to Fanny's Burgers. "

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:56.000
Twenty-five million. Done.

01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:00.800
I'm going to Fanny's Burgers.

01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:03.900
Two and one to the front.
Get ready...

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:07.700
Spike, what are you doing?

01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:12.400
Oh, my God. I'm sorry, guys. I didn't...

01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:20.300
"Please be our lunch date.
X- O-X-O, Peyton and Joe. "

01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:23.600
- Hi!
- Hey!

01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:26.300
Okay. Thank you.

01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:27.900
You were freakishly large.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000
I agree.

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:31.200
No, I'm not. Don't say that.

01:20:31.900 --> 01:20:33.600
- You guys good?
There's the guy right there.

01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:34.800
What did I tell you?

01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:36.600
I agree that you are freakishly large.

01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:38.100
That's not funny.

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:40.900
Hey, Joe! Joe, man!

01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:42.900
Number one.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.300
- Joe, Joe, Joe...
- Joe, Joe, Joe...

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:47.100
- Is it always like this?
- Nah.

01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:48.900
What, you have a big game
coming up?

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.700
- Yeah, the championship.
- That's exciting.

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:54.600
Eight years old and already going to
big events like that, huh? I like it.

01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:58.000
Yeah, unfortunately Peyton's
going to be home by then.

01:20:58.100 --> 01:21:00.100
Her mom gets back from Africa
in a few days.

01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:01.800
Well, can't you just go home
after the game?

01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:05.400
No, I have to get back before she does.

01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:07.100
What did you say?

01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:10.400
You said you'd have to get back
before she does?

01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:11.500
Mmm?

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:13.100
Isn't your mom picking you up?

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:16.200
- Well...
- Peyton.

01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:19.600
I was planning to tell you, Joe.
I really was, but...

01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:22.700
Actually, it's a really funny story.
You're going to love it.

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:25.100
- It's just LOL...
- Quit stalling.

01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:28.200
I'm supposed to be studying
at a special ballet program this month

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:30.800
but instead,
I snuck away to come meet you.

01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:33.700
You ran away?

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:36.700
You ran away?

01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:40.100
- Yummy dessert.
- Is your mom even in Africa?

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:42.900
- About that...
- What have you done?

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.800
Okay, I'm sure there's a reasonable
explanation and everybody...

01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:47.700
The press is going to eat me alive.

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:50.900
What a stupid, stupid, stupid thing
for you to do.

01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:53.500
Did you ever stop and think about
how this was going to impact me?

01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:56.100
Oh, stop it.
That's not going to work this time.

01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:57.300
You're in serious trouble.

01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:58.600
Okay, she's sweating like crazy.
She's coughing. Her lips are swelling.

01:21:58.600 --> 01:21:59.900
Okay, she's sweating like crazy.
She's coughing. Her lips are swelling.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.800
Oh, come on. Don't fall for that.
She's a little world-class performer.

01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:05.200
I don't think she's acting right now.
Give me one second.

01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:07.900
- Are you allergic to something?
- Nuts.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.700
Did you know that?

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:13.300
The dessert has nuts.
Take her to the hospital. Come on.

01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:16.000
Hospital. Where's the nearest hospital?

01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:18.200
Ninth and Woodrow. I'll get the car.

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.900
Where you going?
What are you doing?

01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:24.700
Move, move! Move!

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:26.100
Excuse me, sir.

01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:43.400
Help! My daughter needs help! Help!

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:46.000
What do we got here?
- Help. She's allergic.

01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:48.900
She can't breathe.
She's allergic to nuts.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Looks like an anaphylactic reaction.
Set her down.

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:54.600
- She can't breathe.
- Baby. Baby, open up your mouth.

01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:57.600
Airway's almost closed. Let's move her.

01:22:57.700 --> 01:23:00.000
- Ten liters non-rebreather mask.
- Peyton. Peyton.

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:02.800
I'll show you to the family waiting room.

01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:04.800
It's going to be fine.
They're going to take good care of her.

01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:06.100
She'll be okay.

01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:10.700
Peyton Kelly's father?

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:16.200
I'm Peyton's dad.

01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:18.900
Your daughter is responding well
to the treatment.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.100
We're going to keep her overnight
just to be sure,

01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:22.700
but she's going to be fine.

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:28.700
- Thank you so much. Thank you.
- You were really, really lucky this time.

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:35.200
- She's going to be all right.
- Yeah.

01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:37.000
Okay.

01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:42.400
Please tell me
Peyton's all right.

01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:44.300
She's going to be...

01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:50.900
She's going to be fine. The doctor says
that she's going to be fine.

01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:54.400
You're lucky I haven't called the police.

01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:57.700
- Karen?
- I got home early,

01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:59.300
and I see you and Peyton.

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:02.900
Your faces plastered
on the front of every magazine.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.900
I called Peyton a hundred times
yesterday. She didn't answer.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:10.700
I flew out here, got off the plane,
and I see all of this on the news.

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:12.600
Karen?

01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:16.000
Is that all you can say for yourself,
is "Karen"?

01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:21.100
- I... I thought you were dead.
- I can assure you, I'm not dead.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.500
- How did you find her?
- I didn't. She found me.

01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:32.700
Wait a minute.
Is Peyton's mom still in Africa?

01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:42.300
She didn't tell you, did she?

01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:46.100
Joe,

01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:51.600
Sara died in a car accident
six months ago.

01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:03.800
Oh, Peyton.

01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:22.100
So when we got to Boston,
I put you into the car service.

01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:27.100
I sort of e-mailed
and changed the drop-off location.

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:29.900
The driver took me to Joe's.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.800
Where does everybody
at your ballet school think you are?

01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:35.000
In Africa with you.

01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:39.800
The most important thing
is that you're okay.

01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:43.800
But we're going to discuss
everything else when we get home.

01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:45.800
- Home?
- Yes.

01:25:45.900 --> 01:25:49.000
As soon as Peyton's strong enough,
we're going to go home.

01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:52.000
Hold on a sec. You can't come in here
and think she's going to go home...

01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:55.200
You know what? We're going to discuss
the travel plans a little later.

01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:58.000
Right now,
Peyton needs to get some rest.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
I'm telling you.
It's terrible timing.

01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:05.800
It's absolutely terrible timing.
With the...

01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:07.400
I'm gonna go
get everybody some coffee.

01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:11.300
- Do you want some coffee?
- Double non-fat latte.

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:13.200
Okay. Okay.

01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:35.300
Forget about timing.
I don't care about the game.

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:37.000
I just care about her.

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:41.800
All right. I understand.
But if you could just leave it to...

01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:43.700
- Can we talk?
- Yeah.

01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:49.500
She's asleep. It's okay.

01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:56.900
Here.

01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:00.400
We're all good.

01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:04.800
Are you saying you want Peyton
to live here with you?

01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:08.400
- Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.
- You haven't even been in her life.

01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:11.600
That's not my fault.
I didn't even know she existed!

01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:13.200
And we've come such a long way
in a short time.

01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:16.300
What, you mean since a month ago
when you left her in a bar?

01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:18.300
I am not the same man that I was.

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:21.400
Or an hour ago
when she almost died on your watch?

01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:24.900
This is not about you.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.700
This is about Peyton,
what's best for her.

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:30.600
And she needs to be in a stable home

01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:32.500
with someone who's known her
her whole life.

01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:36.000
Peyton needs her father.
She needs me.

01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:39.000
Of course. It'll be a huge distraction.

01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:44.400
And ugly.
Child custody fights always are.

01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:51.000
Joe will be dragged through the mud.
His endorsements torpedoed.

01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:53.800
He's worked too hard
to have it end like this.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.100
I just don't see him
getting through this.

01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:58.300
My hard work goes down the drain.

01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:00.800
This is exactly the sort of thing
that could end his career.

01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:04.500
That's not your decision to make.
Sara appointed me her guardian.

01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:09.100
I missed eight years of Peyton's life.
And I'm not going to miss any more.

01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:10.600
And I will fight for this.

01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:14.200
Oh, that would be a great thing
to put her through, don't you think?

01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:16.500
Do you have any idea
how to take care of a child?

01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:19.200
I've been doing it for a month now!

01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:21.800
And look where we're standing, Joe.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.500
Hey, P, you're awake.

01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:39.300
- How you feeling?
- I'm okay.

01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:43.100
- I want to go home.
- Okay.

01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:48.900
No problem. Doctor said
you could come home tomorrow.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.700
Then we can go home.

01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:55.400
I want to go home now
with Aunt Karen.

01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:03.400
P, if it's...
If it's what I said at the restaurant,

01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:05.800
honey, I didn't mean that.

01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:09.000
I just want to go home with Aunt Karen.

01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:11.300
I never should've come here.

01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:33.600
Take care of her, will you?

01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:36.200
Hey, you know who
lives in this building?

01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:39.300
Joe Kingman, the quarterback.
How about that, huh?

01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:00.800
Come on, Spike.

01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:02.500
Spike.

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:08.900
Spike, not tonight. Come on, Spike.

01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:13.400
Spike, there's nothing under there.
She's gone. Come on.

01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:16.300
Is that her bag?

01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:48.500
"What's the best thing
that's ever happened to you?"

01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:35.200
"Dear Joe, I have written
this letter a thousand times

01:31:35.300 --> 01:31:37.700
"but I could never find the right words.

01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:39.400
<i>- "We have a daughter. "
We have a daughter.</i>

01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:41.300
<i>- Her name is Peyton.
- "Her name is Peyton. "</i>

01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:46.600
<i>She's like you in so many ways,
athletic, headstrong...</i>

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
<i>Hi, this is Peyton and Karen.</i>

01:31:51.100 --> 01:31:52.700
<i>Leave us a message. Bye.</i>

01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:57.000
<i>I'm so afraid
you'll be angry with me</i>

01:31:57.100 --> 01:31:59.700
<i>and not want anything to do with her.</i>

01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:03.600
<i>We had already decided
to go our separate ways.</i>

01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:08.400
<i>I rationalized that I was doing
the right thing in keeping her from you.</i>

01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:11.700
<i>You were just starting out
in your career.</i>

01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:14.700
<i>A child would have been
such a distraction.</i>

01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:23.200
Idiot.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:29.300
He's open, Joe. Sanders is wide open.

01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:45.400
<i>Hi, this is Peyton and Karen.</i>

01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:47.200
<i>Leave us a message. Bye.</i>

01:32:47.700 --> 01:32:50.800
Hey, just calling to say that...

01:32:54.100 --> 01:32:57.600
Spike, he misses you and...

01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:01.200
I mean, Spike really misses you, he...

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.500
Sounds like someone else
misses her, too.

01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:12.200
Oh, hey.

01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:14.400
Sanders, I was just...

01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:16.200
I was talking to...

01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:21.700
Tell me what I'm supposed to do.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.200
Well, the only thing you can do

01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:28.300
is make sure
that she knows you love her

01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:31.300
and that nothing's
ever going to change that.

01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:34.600
And then when she's ready,
she'll find you again.

01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:39.400
- You know, I owe you a big "thank you. "
- Oh yeah? For what?

01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:43.100
Just for catching everything
I've thrown at you all these years.

01:33:44.300 --> 01:33:46.100
That's what friends are for.

01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:54.200
Hey, old man.
Are we ready to win the big game?

01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:56.900
Hold on a second, Joe.
Can we have a word with you?

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.800
Word has it that your daughter
is no longer staying with you.

01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:02.600
How much easier will it be for you
to focus on football

01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:04.900
without the distraction
of an eight-year-old?

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:08.000
<i>She's not a distraction.
She's my daughter.</i>

01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:09.200
<i>I'd want her here with me</i>

01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:13.400
<i>even if it meant I'd never play
another football game again.</i>

01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:17.400
<i>There's nothing that I love more
than my daughter.</i>

01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:18.800
<i>Nothing.</i>

01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:46.200
<i>Here we are as the two biggest
rivals in football square off</i>

01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:49.600
<i>for their chance
to etch their names in sports history.</i>

01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:51.200
<i>You know,
and I think the question today, Marv,</i>

01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:54.000
<i>is will Joe Kingman
finally get a chance at glory?</i>

01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:57.400
<i>Or will New York win their third title
in the last four years?</i>

01:34:57.500 --> 01:34:58.500
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go, Joe.

01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:00.800
<i>Third and long
for the Rebels.</i>

01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:03.700
<i>Here's Kingman... Back to throw.</i>

01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:06.400
<i>Oh, he's drilled
by the linebacker, Drake.</i>

01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:08.900
<i>New York has recovered the fumble.</i>

01:35:10.100 --> 01:35:12.500
<i>Boomer,
Kingman is way off his game today.</i>

01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:14.200
<i>This is not the same Boston team</i>

01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:15.300
<i>we've seen march through
the playoffs.</i>

01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:17.000
<i>You know Marv, I can't explain this.</i>

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:17.600
<i>You know Marv,
I can't explain this.</i>

01:35:17.700 --> 01:35:19.800
<i>I mean,
he's missing wide-open receivers.</i>

01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:23.400
<i>He's been sacked four times, and he
looks like he's distracted to me.</i>

01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:26.200
So whatever that distraction is,
he's got to put it aside.

01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:29.000
<i>He owes it to his teammates
and the fans of the Boston team</i>

01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:30.300
<i>to play it and lay it on the line.</i>

01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:32.700
Your guy's not looking so hot.

01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:37.700
How long has it been since you've had
one of your own Fanny's burgers?

01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:40.700
Mmm.

01:35:42.100 --> 01:35:43.700
Too long, is my guess.

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:49.600
Deflects right lead,
speed left squirrel. On one. Ready?

01:35:50.900 --> 01:35:52.500
<i>The Rebels
trailing seven-three.</i>

01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:55.700
<i>Less than a minute remaining
in the first half.</i>

01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:57.400
<i>Kingman has his team at the line.</i>

01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:01.100
<i>Cooper, wide right,
shifts back to tight end.</i>

01:36:01.300 --> 01:36:04.200
<i>Signal's called, and here's Kingman.</i>

01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:05.600
Yes, go!

01:36:05.700 --> 01:36:07.400
<i>Kingman on the run.</i>

01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:09.200
<i>He is crushed.</i>

01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:11.900
<i>"Crushed" is right, Marv.</i>

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.300
<i>Drake, the linebacker for New York,
is having a whale of a football game.</i>

01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:16.800
<i>They are on a mission
to shut Kingman up.</i>

01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:20.500
<i>Welcome to the championship game,
Kingman.</i>

01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:24.900
Who's the king now, Joe? I am!

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.800
Come on, Joe! Get up, Joe!

01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:30.200
- Yeah, baby! Let's go!
- Get Danville.

01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:32.900
<i>Hold on for a second, Marv.
Joe Kingman is still down.</i>

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.900
<i>It looks like he was hit by a truck.</i>

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:36.300
Believe me, I know. I've been there.

01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:38.600
This hit is not going to be easy
to come back from.

01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:41.800
<i>So, Boomer, you never want to
speculate as to the extent of the injury.</i>

01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:43.600
<i>They're being very careful,
as you can see,</i>

01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:46.100
<i>lifting Joe Kingman onto that gurney.</i>

01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:47.800
<i>Well, they really can't evaluate him
on the field.</i>

01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:49.400
<i>They want to do that
in the locker room.</i>

01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:51.500
<i>Some way, Joe Kingman
is going to have to find a way</i>

01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:52.500
<i>to get back on this field.</i>

01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:55.900
- Don't worry, he's tough.
- He better be.

01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:59.400
Oh, he is. Tough as nails.

01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:02.500
<i>And there's the backup
quarterback, Danville, taking the knee,</i>

01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:04.300
<i>so that does it for the first half.</i>

01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:05.600
<i>This is not good
for the Rebels.</i>

01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:08.700
<i>They have got to hope that Kingman
can find the strength to come back.</i>

01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:10.800
- All right, what's going on here?
- It doesn't look good, Coach.

01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:14.300
He's got a separated shoulder,
bruised ribs. I think he's done.

01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:16.000
Joe, it's your call.

01:37:16.100 --> 01:37:19.300
If you think you can handle it, then...

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:20.700
What do you say?

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.700
Put Danville in.

01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:35.600
That's the best thing for the team.

01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:37.800
<i>Can you believe this?</i>

01:37:37.900 --> 01:37:41.200
<i>It looks like Danville, the backup
quarterback, is checking in.</i>

01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:42.700
He hasn't played all season.

01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:45.300
Can you say,
"Nightmare scenario for Boston"?

01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:48.500
He's coming back out, right?
You know how important this deal is.

01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:53.600
Sam, baby. Not to worry.
Our Joe's not a quitter.

01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:05.400
Go, Boston.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.800
<i>So, it's all in the hands
of the backup quarterback, Danville.</i>

01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:13.200
<i>And he's in trouble,
and down he goes.</i>

01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:15.300
<i>Joe Kingman must be banged up
pretty bad.</i>

01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:16.800
<i>If not, he would never let Maddox</i>

01:38:16.900 --> 01:38:18.600
<i>take him out
of the championship game.</i>

01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:22.400
Turn them off.

01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:25.100
I said turn them off!

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:30.000
Hey, Joe. You got money
on New York or something?

01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:34.900
Peyton? Come here.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.500
It's okay.

01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:44.000
Please tell me
you're not on the lam again.

01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:46.900
No, this time she brought the warden
with her.

01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:51.300
- What are you guys doing here?
- I called an audible.

01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:54.000
See, I thought you'd be better off
without me.

01:38:55.900 --> 01:39:00.900
But judging by the butt-whupping
you got out there, I guess I was wrong.

01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:06.800
I love you, Daddy.
I want to come home.

01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:10.500
I love you too, Peyton.
I love you so much.

01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:14.300
She needs her father.

01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:17.200
She needs you, Joe.

01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:21.900
Are you serious?

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.600
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:27.300
- Yeah.
- Come here!

01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:31.700
- Daddy, can't breathe.
- Joe, can't breathe.

01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:33.100
Me either.

01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:36.900
So, why aren't you out there playing?

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.900
I thought the team
would be better off without me.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:43.100
I didn't come all this way
to see my dad sit out the big game.

01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:44.900
I'm really banged up, P.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.100
Did I just hear the King give up?

01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:51.400
We've worked way too hard
for you to throw in the towel now.

01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:55.700
My dad's not a quitter.
And he never says no.

01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:15.200
I have an answer to your question, P.

01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:17.400
Win or lose today,

01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:20.700
you're the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.000
<i>Marv, what is this?</i>

01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:47.900
<i>There's some sort of commotion
down by the tunnel.</i>

01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:50.500
Time! Time!

01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:54.500
<i>And it's Joe Kingman. He's come out!</i>

01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:56.500
<i>What a moment for Kingman,
his teammates,</i>

01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:58.600
<i>and certainly Boston's fans.</i>

01:40:58.700 --> 01:41:02.300
- Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe!
- Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe!

01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:05.400
All right. All right. Coach, your call.

01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:09.000
Your team.

01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:13.200
All right. Train red two.
Fifty win pass zebra. All right?

01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:18.000
Hey, hey, hey, come on! Nobody look
at the clock! Look at me! Look at me!

01:41:18.100 --> 01:41:20.000
We got plenty of time,
and I'm going to tell you why.

01:41:20.100 --> 01:41:24.100
You know why?
Because the Rebels never say "no. "

01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:25.100
Break!

01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:28.500
Come on, Joe! Destroy them!

01:41:29.300 --> 01:41:32.200
<i>With only a minute remaining,
Kingman would have to put together</i>

01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:33.800
the drive of the century.

01:41:33.900 --> 01:41:37.400
He'll have to march
the Rebels 65 yards.

01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:39.800
<i>Boomer, he has no timeouts remaining</i>

01:41:39.900 --> 01:41:42.500
<i>and they need
a touchdown for the win.</i>

01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:45.300
Down set!

01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:47.600
<i>All right,
Kingman makes changes at the line.</i>

01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:51.800
Go Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:53.900
Back 88.

01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:57.100
Back 88!

01:41:57.500 --> 01:41:59.400
Hut-hut! Hut!

01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:04.400
<i>Kingman. Back to throw.
He's forced out of the pocket.</i>

01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:07.400
<i>And now flips it...</i>

01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:09.600
<i>Webber with the catch!</i>

01:42:10.300 --> 01:42:13.200
<i>But he cuts inside.
Does not go to the outside.</i>

01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:15.100
<i>Can't get out of bounds
to stop the clock.</i>

01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:16.600
<i>Webber needed
to get out of bounds.</i>

01:42:16.700 --> 01:42:18.400
<i>He knows
that they don't have any timeouts left.</i>

01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:21.200
<i>Now, it's up to Kingman to get
his team to the line of scrimmage</i>

01:42:21.300 --> 01:42:22.700
<i>and call a play quickly.</i>

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:25.300
Black! Fifty-nine razor!

01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:26.400
Take Drake!

01:42:26.500 --> 01:42:30.600
<i>Now second down with
24 seconds left from the Boston 44.</i>

01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:32.100
<i>Out of the shotgun.</i>

01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:35.400
<i>Can't find anybody, he's on the run.</i>

01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:37.600
<i>There's the "Kingman Swing. "</i>

01:42:38.300 --> 01:42:40.900
<i>Kingman with some fancy footwork.</i>

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:44.000
<i>Fancy? The King looks
downright graceful all of a sudden.</i>

01:42:44.100 --> 01:42:46.800
<i>He's to the 25... The 20...</i>

01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:49.700
<i>He took a hard hit! Oh, man!</i>

01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:52.400
<i>Knocked out of bounds at the 17.</i>

01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:54.600
Come on, Joe. Get up. Get up, Joe!

01:42:54.700 --> 01:42:57.200
<i>Can he get up, though?
That's the question.</i>

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Yeah!

01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:07.000
<i>I'll tell you, Kingman
continues to show his toughness.</i>

01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:09.500
<i>And, Marv, with four
seconds left to go in the game,</i>

01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:13.200
<i>I don't know a quarterback
who doesn't live for a moment like this.</i>

01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:16.900
Come on, guys. Come on, team.
Come on.

01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:19.500
Come on, Rebels!
You can do it!

01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:21.800
Come on, number one!

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.200
Great block, Webber. Great block.

01:43:24.300 --> 01:43:25.600
It has come down to this.

01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:29.400
With time for one last play,
Kingman brings his team to the line.

01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:32.000
<i>Can he pull off yet another miracle?</i>

01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:35.000
<i>Marv, this is Joe Kingman's
moment. Can he deliver?</i>

01:43:35.100 --> 01:43:36.800
<i>This is the stuff
that legends are made of.</i>

01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:38.000
Come on, Daddy!

01:43:39.300 --> 01:43:41.000
Check 52! 52!

01:43:45.100 --> 01:43:47.000
I'm going to show you
who the real king is, Joe.

01:43:47.100 --> 01:43:49.000
You about to get done lit up, son!

01:43:49.100 --> 01:43:51.400
What? Are you stupid or something?

01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:54.000
"Stupid" is a mean word!

01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:56.000
Hut-hut! Hut!

01:43:58.900 --> 01:44:00.700
Stay off my quarterback!

01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:04.100
<i>In what could be
the final play of the season</i>

01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:07.600
<i>Kingman looking downfield.
He has Sanders.</i>

01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:18.100
<i>It is caught!</i>

01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:22.300
<i>Touchdown!
Boston has won the championship!</i>

01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:41.100
Let's go watch my MVP
take your 25 million, shall we?

01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:44.900
<i>An incredible ending
to a magnificent career.</i>

01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:47.900
<i>Joe Kingman, finally a champion.</i>

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:51.900
Okay, Joe. This is it.
"I'm going to Fanny's Burgers. "

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.400
Hey, Joe Kingman,
you've just won the championship,

01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:56.700
so what are you going to do now?

01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:01.500
I'm going to take my daughter home.

01:45:14.300 --> 01:45:16.600
Daddy, you won the championship.

01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:19.600
Oh, Peyton,
I've won much more than that.

01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:28.800
Yeah!

01:48:18.100 --> 01:48:19.900
And cut!

01:48:20.305 --> 01:48:26.664
