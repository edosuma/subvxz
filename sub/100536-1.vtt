WEBVTT

03:09.841 --> 03:12.366
- Jeff, introduce me.
-Of course. Of course.

03:12.409 --> 03:14.237
Eh, uh, Otis?

03:14.281 --> 03:18.720
Uh, I'd like to introduce you
to Jean-Luc Deschamp.

03:19.286 --> 03:22.158
-Pleasure to meet you.
-What a handsome young man.

03:24.943 --> 03:27.816
Isn't Otis's work
absolutely beautiful? Isn't it?

03:28.991 --> 03:31.211
Yes. It's quite good...

03:31.994 --> 03:34.605
at exemplifying a certain genre.

03:36.346 --> 03:38.000
As a work is Apollonian.

03:38.043 --> 03:39.567
It's controlled,

03:39.610 --> 03:42.309
which I respect very much.

03:43.962 --> 03:46.617
I'm looking
for something more energized

03:46.661 --> 03:48.706
by a Dionysian release.

03:50.012 --> 03:51.796
Why don't you tell me
what you really think?

03:54.059 --> 03:55.147
Honestly, it's good.

03:56.714 --> 04:01.153
But you need to let go,
lose control.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.679
Self-proclaimed authority.

04:04.722 --> 04:06.811
Gentlemen, please. Uh...

04:06.855 --> 04:07.682
Jean-Luc?

04:10.424 --> 04:11.599
Excuse me.

04:13.688 --> 04:15.255
Excuse me.

04:18.562 --> 04:20.390
That was not smart.

04:21.348 --> 04:22.871
If you wanna keep
the lights on in here,

04:22.914 --> 04:25.482
we have to keep selling, Otis.

04:26.570 --> 04:28.398
He's wearing all leather.

04:28.442 --> 04:30.574
Otis. Otis.

05:26.761 --> 05:27.936
Wow.

05:30.025 --> 05:31.766
You look fantastic.

05:31.809 --> 05:33.289
Nice to see you, too.

05:37.685 --> 05:39.339
Great show last night.

05:40.209 --> 05:41.906
But...

05:41.950 --> 05:44.996
I'm ready
to see you tackle a bigger fish.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.695
Like selling to Deschamp?

05:47.738 --> 05:50.262
Well, it's a start.

05:50.306 --> 05:52.395
You know, sorry
I can't continually create

05:52.439 --> 05:55.180
something out of nothing
like some factory line crap.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.532
-I'm not trying to upset you.

05:58.575 --> 06:00.534
Oh, you're over here
first thing in the morning

06:00.577 --> 06:03.406
telling me we need to show him
Foo-Foo's Art Gallery.

06:04.755 --> 06:06.191
Cut the crap.

06:07.802 --> 06:10.065
Since you don't care,

06:10.108 --> 06:11.632
you can move out of this loft

06:11.675 --> 06:13.111
and go back
to where I found you.

06:15.940 --> 06:18.073
Look, Jeff. I've just been
having a hard time sleeping.

06:20.815 --> 06:22.860
-Do you want some pills?
- No.

06:22.904 --> 06:25.254
-I can get you some--
-No. They-- They don't work.

06:25.297 --> 06:29.084
I'm like a fucking working
stiff zombie the next day.

06:29.127 --> 06:31.042
Wait. No, no. Wait, wait, wait.
You know what?

06:31.086 --> 06:32.870
I have a friend.

06:32.914 --> 06:34.263
He-- He works in the university.

06:34.306 --> 06:35.917
He specializes in sleep.

06:37.484 --> 06:38.702
Why don't you go see him?

06:39.442 --> 06:40.791
I don't wanna do that.

06:42.227 --> 06:43.315
Why not?

06:43.359 --> 06:45.361
'Cause my life is for me
and me only,

06:45.405 --> 06:47.450
not some fucking quack.

06:47.494 --> 06:49.104
You don't have a choice.

06:49.147 --> 06:51.236
I just floated you
a whole heap of money.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.891
You're gonna go
and you're gonna be cooperative.

06:55.589 --> 06:57.025
I'm leaving.

07:09.211 --> 07:10.952
How many of you
have had nightmares?

07:12.214 --> 07:13.607
How many of those nightmares...

07:13.650 --> 07:15.522
-...ever felt real?

07:30.711 --> 07:33.888
The Nightmare by Henry Fuseli.

07:33.931 --> 07:38.066
It is believed he's illustrating
sleep paralysis.

07:40.547 --> 07:43.419
Sleep paralysis
is a transitional state

07:43.463 --> 07:45.116
between wakefulness and sleep,

07:45.160 --> 07:49.730
and often occurs
with terrifying hallucinations

07:49.773 --> 07:51.558
to which one is unable to react,

07:52.297 --> 07:55.387
and typically associated
with the incubus visitations,

07:55.431 --> 07:58.478
which are shown
in this painting,

07:58.521 --> 08:02.830
and has a much higher occurrence
of out-of-body experiences,

08:02.873 --> 08:06.268
sometimes involving
people from one's past.

08:06.311 --> 08:07.661
So, like, ghosts?

08:07.704 --> 08:09.314
Actually, yes.

08:09.358 --> 08:11.665
What one would perceive
to be ghosts.

08:13.275 --> 08:15.016
It's consistently found
in trauma victims.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.367
-Ah, we're out of time.

08:18.410 --> 08:21.326
Um, remember,
we have a test next week.

08:23.067 --> 08:25.069
Professor Freeman,
I signed up

08:25.113 --> 08:27.289
for your research
and ethics course next semester.

08:27.332 --> 08:30.422
That's great, but attendance
is part of the grade.

08:30.466 --> 08:31.467
I'm here.

08:31.511 --> 08:32.947
It's the beginning
of the semester,

08:32.990 --> 08:34.644
and you've already
missed two classes.

08:34.688 --> 08:37.299
I know. I work nights.

08:37.342 --> 08:39.562
You're gonna need 40 hours
of research participation

08:39.606 --> 08:41.303
at the end of this semester
if you wanna be

08:41.346 --> 08:43.261
in my research and ethics class.

08:43.305 --> 08:47.483
I was really hoping to work
with you on your new research.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.964
I'm not looking
for a new assistant.

08:50.660 --> 08:54.621
I know, but the sleep paralysis
we talked about today?

08:55.622 --> 08:57.188
I'd like to be your subject.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.888
-What's happening at night?

09:02.237 --> 09:04.326
What's not happening at night?

09:09.287 --> 09:10.854
I'm sorry. I didn't--

09:11.463 --> 09:13.204
I didn't mean
to sit on your desk.

09:14.466 --> 09:16.164
Would it make up
for my attendance grade?

09:18.253 --> 09:19.820
Okay, come see me next week.

09:28.132 --> 09:30.439
Now I know why
you became a professor.

09:30.482 --> 09:32.397
Jeff!

09:32.441 --> 09:34.574
I wanted to see how
academic life was treating you,

09:34.617 --> 09:35.705
and apparently, quite well.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.315
Ah, I gotta go to a meeting.

09:37.359 --> 09:39.491
-I'll walk with you.
-Sure.

09:39.535 --> 09:41.450
Tell me you didn't
get dressed up for me.

09:41.493 --> 09:43.626
-I got dressed up for you.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.323
What's going on?
How's the gallery?

09:45.367 --> 09:47.064
It's-- It's great. It's great.

09:47.108 --> 09:49.545
Um, I have this new client.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.330
He's really young,
but very talented.

09:52.374 --> 09:53.549
Hmm.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.855
We're trying to get him
to the next level,

09:54.898 --> 09:56.900
but I don't know,
I've got this feeling

09:56.944 --> 09:59.468
that he's a little,
I don't know, blocked.

10:00.817 --> 10:03.428
He's having trouble sleeping.

10:03.472 --> 10:05.953
Okay, and if he can sleep again,
he can become unblocked.

10:05.996 --> 10:07.171
Exactly. Exactly.

10:07.215 --> 10:08.695
So, I told him I have a friend

10:08.738 --> 10:10.522
who might be able
to help him out.

10:10.566 --> 10:12.699
Isn't that part
of the artist conflict?

10:12.742 --> 10:15.745
Well, only
if you romanticize it.

10:15.789 --> 10:18.879
At the end of the day,
it's a business.

10:18.922 --> 10:21.795
Hmm. I'm starting a study.

10:21.838 --> 10:23.448
If he's willing to be
a participant,

10:23.492 --> 10:25.973
this could be a win
for both of us.

10:26.016 --> 10:27.235
Whatever you need.

10:27.278 --> 10:29.411
Let me meet with him first,
though, okay?

10:29.454 --> 10:32.283
-Okay, but this is good.
- I love the suit.

10:45.209 --> 10:47.951
-Charlie.
-Rich. How are you?

10:47.995 --> 10:49.605
-Good.
-Good to see you.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.825
Oh, hey, Alice.
Oh, you look lovely. Mwah!

10:51.868 --> 10:54.001
Thank you.
Tonight's a big night.

10:54.044 --> 10:55.480
- Mm-hmm.
-Indeed, it is.

10:55.524 --> 10:57.265
Both you guys are nominated.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.137
-Um, hi.
- Oh, sorry.

11:00.181 --> 11:02.096
Rich, this is
our good friend Leigh.

11:02.139 --> 11:04.011
She works with Alice.

11:04.054 --> 11:06.013
-Uh, congratulations.
- Oh, thank you.

11:07.710 --> 11:08.972
Charlie, we better
get in there, huh?

11:09.016 --> 11:10.626
- Yeah.
-Nice to meet you.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.193
Nice to meet you, too.

11:13.498 --> 11:14.804
Mwah!

11:15.936 --> 11:17.807
First off, let's give
a round of applause

11:17.851 --> 11:19.330
to both of our nominees,

11:19.374 --> 11:22.420
Dr. Charles Engel
and Dr. Richard Freeman.

11:28.252 --> 11:29.906
It gives me great pleasure
to present

11:29.950 --> 11:31.734
the Miller Presidential Citation

11:31.778 --> 11:35.172
for Distinguished Contributions
in Psychology.

11:38.523 --> 11:40.787
This year's
Presidential Citation

11:40.830 --> 11:43.615
goes to Dr. Charles Engel!

11:52.712 --> 11:54.278
Congratulations, Dr. Engel.

11:54.322 --> 11:55.192
- Ah!

11:58.021 --> 12:01.111
Higher education
is at a crossroads.

12:02.069 --> 12:04.767
More students
are attending college,

12:04.811 --> 12:07.117
the costs continue
to rise faster than inflation,

12:07.901 --> 12:11.731
and with government sources
increasingly unpredictable,

12:12.383 --> 12:17.084
it is our job and responsibility
as educators and researchers

12:17.127 --> 12:19.564
to find ways
to fill that vacuum.

12:20.391 --> 12:23.264
So it is with great pleasure
that I announce

12:23.307 --> 12:25.745
that we have been invited
to compete

12:25.788 --> 12:29.574
for the Vorous Pharmaceuticals
sleep grant.

12:34.449 --> 12:37.104
It's with the support
of organizations like theirs

12:37.147 --> 12:40.847
that we will be able to fund
our cutting-edge research

12:40.890 --> 12:43.763
and grow as a university.

12:51.901 --> 12:53.337
Can I borrow this guy
for a second?

12:53.381 --> 12:55.775
-Of course. Good seeing you.
-Thanks, Bob.

12:55.818 --> 12:57.820
Ah, Steven!

12:57.864 --> 12:59.430
- Ah.
-What are you doing here?

12:59.474 --> 13:01.171
Well, the Alumni Association
invited me,

13:01.215 --> 13:03.173
but when I saw that
my former doctoral candidate

13:03.217 --> 13:04.871
was nominated,
I figured I'd make the trip.

13:04.914 --> 13:07.395
-How's Albany?
-It's-- It's great. It's great.

13:07.438 --> 13:08.831
We're working with veterans now.

13:08.875 --> 13:11.007
Good for you.

13:11.051 --> 13:14.445
Steven! Nice to see you.

13:14.489 --> 13:17.057
Great speech.
Charming, as always.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.580
Thank you, Steven.

13:18.623 --> 13:20.364
But since when
did corporate sponsors

13:20.408 --> 13:22.453
get invited
to university events?

13:22.497 --> 13:24.673
Things have changed
since your resignation.

13:24.716 --> 13:26.631
Mm-hmm. Whatever you need
to tell yourself

13:26.675 --> 13:28.024
to look in the mirror, I guess.

13:29.721 --> 13:31.549
Hmm. Gentlemen.

13:31.593 --> 13:33.595
Ah.

13:33.638 --> 13:36.511
Yeah, you know, she talks
about the cost of education.

13:36.554 --> 13:38.295
When she was made dean,

13:38.339 --> 13:40.820
she didn't take a pay cut
for her exorbitant salary.

13:40.863 --> 13:43.257
She cut jobs,
and then she went to Vorous

13:43.300 --> 13:45.694
to get sponsorship for research.

13:46.477 --> 13:48.436
Look at that sniveling
little shit.

13:50.438 --> 13:51.961
Buying up universities.

13:53.310 --> 13:56.139
Anyway, anyway, um, how are you?
Are you happy?

13:56.183 --> 13:57.358
-Yeah.
- Good, good.

13:57.401 --> 13:58.794
To tell you the truth,

13:58.838 --> 14:00.796
we could use somebody like you.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.146
Your sleep work could make
a big difference

14:03.190 --> 14:04.844
to a lot of the folks
we've been treating.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.325
So why don't you come
work with me?

14:10.066 --> 14:11.502
-In Albany?
- Yeah.

14:11.546 --> 14:13.113
Yes, well, I know it wouldn't be

14:13.156 --> 14:15.419
Dean Gasbag's
grand vision of the future,

14:15.463 --> 14:17.160
but you'd be
making a difference,

14:17.204 --> 14:19.206
and that's what you said
you wanted to do in school.

14:22.557 --> 14:24.733
I'm flattered, but...

14:24.776 --> 14:26.953
I-- I'm just caught up
in all my work here.

14:28.171 --> 14:29.607
No, I figured. I figured.

14:29.651 --> 14:31.044
But should you change your mind,
come on--

14:31.087 --> 14:32.654
Uh, absolutely.

14:35.004 --> 14:36.963
Don't fly too high,
Richard, all right?

14:37.006 --> 14:38.834
-Thanks, Steven.
- Good to see you.

14:41.445 --> 14:42.272
Hey.

14:43.578 --> 14:45.841
Have you, uh...
Have you seen Charlie and Alice?

14:45.885 --> 14:48.539
They gotta be
around here somewhere, right?

14:50.237 --> 14:51.673
Do you wanna get out of here?

14:51.716 --> 14:53.066
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

14:53.109 --> 14:54.415
-Come on.
-Okay.

14:54.458 --> 14:55.416
Thank you for saving me.

14:57.026 --> 14:59.724
I don't know who saved who.
I was ready to get out of there.

14:59.768 --> 15:01.726
Tough break tonight.

15:01.770 --> 15:03.467
Charlie? No.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.730
I should've known.

15:05.774 --> 15:08.081
The award is named
after his mother's father.

15:08.124 --> 15:09.821
He's a school legacy.

15:11.084 --> 15:13.913
Well, you seem
like a very important professor.

15:15.523 --> 15:17.525
-I am very important.
-Yeah?

15:19.179 --> 15:20.702
So you work with Alice?

15:20.745 --> 15:22.922
Yeah, uh, social worker
for the city.

15:24.749 --> 15:26.099
We should go out sometime.

15:28.014 --> 15:29.015
I'd like that.

15:43.116 --> 15:45.031
Richard, come in.

15:50.906 --> 15:52.342
What can I do for you?

15:57.739 --> 15:59.871
I've been giving it
some thought, and...

16:01.308 --> 16:02.787
I wanna go for the grant.

16:04.050 --> 16:05.312
I don't think so.

16:05.355 --> 16:07.270
That's reserved for our best
and our brightest.

16:08.793 --> 16:11.535
I was just nominated
at the Presidential Dinner.

16:11.579 --> 16:13.189
But you didn't win.

16:13.233 --> 16:15.800
And I want to win
the Vorous grant.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.717
Plus, if you lose,
how does that make me look?

16:22.068 --> 16:24.679
Like you said, the--

16:24.722 --> 16:26.811
The grant would be
a windfall for the university,

16:26.855 --> 16:28.465
and it would help fund
my research.

16:30.685 --> 16:32.078
How do you propose winning?

16:33.296 --> 16:36.299
By presenting the study
based on our findings.

16:36.343 --> 16:38.954
No, that does not equal winning.

16:40.042 --> 16:41.913
What are you willing to do?

16:47.702 --> 16:48.746
We'll win.

16:51.401 --> 16:53.360
Get your focus group together
by next week,

16:53.403 --> 16:54.752
and I'll push it through.

16:56.624 --> 16:58.147
And, Richard...

17:00.062 --> 17:01.716
Don't fuck this up.

17:11.987 --> 17:13.858
So why study sleep?

17:13.902 --> 17:17.340
It's the gateway
to why we do things,

17:17.384 --> 17:20.082
how we consolidate memories.

17:20.126 --> 17:21.823
It's the one point

17:21.866 --> 17:24.043
when our minds
are completely uninhibited.

17:24.086 --> 17:26.958
We may dream
of being able to do things

17:27.002 --> 17:28.917
we would never do in real life.

17:28.960 --> 17:29.831
Essentially...

17:30.614 --> 17:32.660
it's a second world to explore.

17:32.703 --> 17:34.836
So why your study?

17:34.879 --> 17:36.142
To help people.

17:37.447 --> 17:40.711
By analyzing dreams,
I can tailor a therapy

17:40.755 --> 17:45.107
to an individual who has
experienced some form of trauma.

17:45.151 --> 17:48.458
By exploring those dreams,
I can, in theory,

17:48.502 --> 17:50.330
get to the root of the problem.

17:53.202 --> 17:54.812
So, why, um...

17:54.856 --> 17:56.466
So why social work?

17:57.685 --> 17:59.034
Honestly?

17:59.078 --> 18:03.125
I love my job, but it's a grind.

18:03.169 --> 18:05.649
There's just
so many terrible situations

18:05.693 --> 18:08.217
and really not all that much
that can be done.

18:08.261 --> 18:11.133
I'm actually in the process
of starting up

18:11.177 --> 18:14.571
a non-profit upstate for kids
who come from abusive homes.

18:14.615 --> 18:17.008
-Good for you.
- Hmm.

18:17.052 --> 18:18.662
What about your job in the city?

18:18.706 --> 18:20.751
Well, the camp
would give me the opportunity

18:20.795 --> 18:24.364
to affect change in
a more positive environment

18:24.407 --> 18:26.322
without all the red tape.

18:26.366 --> 18:29.369
-You're kind of incredible.

18:29.412 --> 18:31.110
-Just kind of?

18:31.153 --> 18:32.372
Seriously.

18:40.771 --> 18:43.426
-What are you doing?

18:43.470 --> 18:44.688
Come on.

18:47.343 --> 18:49.824
Come on! Don't be a pussy.

19:02.706 --> 19:05.318
I don't remember the last time
I was on a playground.

19:05.361 --> 19:07.668
Yeah, well, I think
it might be kind of weird.

19:07.711 --> 19:10.061
A single guy hanging out
on a playground around children.

19:15.458 --> 19:18.113
-Do you have kids?
-No.

19:19.419 --> 19:21.595
Do you want them?

19:21.638 --> 19:23.945
Eh, part of me wants to adopt.

19:23.988 --> 19:25.251
I mean,
there's just so many kids

19:25.294 --> 19:28.515
who don't have a good home.

19:33.694 --> 19:35.174
-Oh, shit. Come on.
- Go, go.

19:36.131 --> 19:38.220
-Shh.

21:05.089 --> 21:06.656
- Hey, hey.

21:09.442 --> 21:11.226
What's going on?

21:11.270 --> 21:14.708
We-- We were watching a movie,
and you fell asleep.

21:14.751 --> 21:17.319
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Are you okay?

21:17.363 --> 21:19.278
Yeah, I just--

21:20.409 --> 21:21.758
There was a man.

21:22.716 --> 21:23.934
Where?

21:25.849 --> 21:29.723
I just have
really intense dreams sometimes.

21:31.942 --> 21:33.727
I'm sorry. I should go.

21:33.770 --> 21:35.903
Uh, do you wanna--
You wanna talk about it?

22:03.974 --> 22:05.846
Fantasy, abandoned by reason,

22:05.889 --> 22:08.109
produces impossible monsters.

22:10.459 --> 22:12.243
Goya's Sleep of Reason.

22:13.767 --> 22:14.811
Are you a fan?

22:19.381 --> 22:21.949
Dr. Freeman, I'm Otis.

22:21.992 --> 22:26.475
Oh! Nice to meet you.
I'm glad Jeff suggested we meet.

22:27.868 --> 22:30.218
Goya unleashes
his nightmares for his art.

22:30.261 --> 22:33.308
Those who sleepwalk as...

22:33.352 --> 22:35.441
monsters awake around us.

22:38.444 --> 22:40.794
-So you're a painter?
- I am.

22:43.971 --> 22:46.582
Do you, uh...
Do you only paint?

22:47.931 --> 22:51.935
I work with a variety
of mediums.

22:51.979 --> 22:54.285
And what do you like?

22:54.329 --> 22:56.636
Oh, it's-- it's not what I like.

22:57.898 --> 22:59.465
It's what I feel.

23:00.901 --> 23:02.598
And what do you feel?

23:05.949 --> 23:08.996
I'm searching for beauty.

23:10.693 --> 23:11.955
Why beauty?

23:13.609 --> 23:16.699
'Cause there's a lot of ugliness
in the world.

23:18.701 --> 23:20.094
And in your world?

23:21.835 --> 23:23.532
I have these nightmares.

23:25.229 --> 23:27.275
I'm... asleep.

23:27.318 --> 23:30.800
I-- I think I'm awake,
but I'm not.

23:32.802 --> 23:35.805
And it feels like I'm having
some kind of a...

23:35.849 --> 23:37.416
a panic attack.

23:38.852 --> 23:40.854
Everyone has nightmares.

23:40.897 --> 23:43.378
Yeah, but I'm conscious of it.

23:45.336 --> 23:49.471
Have you ever seen
the Fuseli painting,

23:49.515 --> 23:50.907
The Nightmare?

23:53.693 --> 23:54.998
You know what I'm talking about?

23:55.042 --> 23:57.392
Uh, yes. Yes. What about it?

23:58.872 --> 24:01.440
Well, the woman, she's--

24:01.483 --> 24:02.702
she's pinned to the bed,

24:02.745 --> 24:05.879
which makes sense
in the painting.

24:05.922 --> 24:07.707
You think she should be pinned?

24:07.750 --> 24:09.883
Naturally.

24:09.926 --> 24:12.973
I mean, one could argue
that a relationship is a--

24:13.016 --> 24:16.324
is a competition of power
between two people,

24:16.367 --> 24:17.804
men or women.

24:19.588 --> 24:21.721
In these nightmares,

24:21.764 --> 24:22.939
are you in control?

25:07.288 --> 25:09.769
Richard. Good to see you.

25:09.812 --> 25:13.512
Have you met Mr. Stivek
of Vorous Pharmaceuticals?

25:13.555 --> 25:14.861
Nice to meet you.

25:14.904 --> 25:16.427
Dean Gaslow's been telling me
about your study.

25:16.471 --> 25:19.430
We're looking forward
to seeing the results.

25:19.474 --> 25:22.521
Mr. Stivek had
a couple of concerns.

25:23.913 --> 25:25.654
Concerns?

25:25.698 --> 25:28.265
Vorous wants to make sure
they have all the potential data

25:28.309 --> 25:31.617
when making a decision
about the grant winner.

25:32.269 --> 25:34.576
I'm always very thorough.

25:34.620 --> 25:39.407
I'm not asking you
to invent, but...

25:39.450 --> 25:42.497
what can you bring to the table
that would give us a leg up?

25:45.413 --> 25:47.589
Tell us
about one of your dreams.

25:47.633 --> 25:52.072
Well, it always starts outside.

25:53.813 --> 25:56.555
It's a beautiful fall day.

26:02.865 --> 26:04.301
What about the man?

26:06.477 --> 26:07.696
What man?

26:09.698 --> 26:10.960
Isn't there a man?

26:11.961 --> 26:12.788
No.

26:15.486 --> 26:16.618
But you said--

26:17.663 --> 26:19.795
You know what? I'm sorry.

26:26.715 --> 26:28.021
Excuse me.

26:32.373 --> 26:33.200
Well.

26:38.727 --> 26:40.337
Leigh, where are you going?

26:40.381 --> 26:42.078
Why would you ask
about the man in my dream?

26:42.122 --> 26:43.340
You told me.

26:43.384 --> 26:45.995
Yeah, I told you
when it was just us.

26:47.431 --> 26:49.085
Rich, is this even ethical?

26:50.696 --> 26:52.654
-Please, just come back inside.
- No.

26:53.437 --> 26:54.482
I'm gonna go.

26:58.573 --> 26:59.966
Jeez.

27:10.106 --> 27:11.673
Where were we?

27:11.717 --> 27:14.633
I wake up in the morning,
and my jaw hurts.

27:15.503 --> 27:17.548
That sounds kinda scandalous.

27:17.592 --> 27:19.681
You're probably just
grinding your teeth at night.

27:21.727 --> 27:24.207
It doesn't feel like grinding.

27:26.253 --> 27:28.647
It feels
like they're falling out.

27:30.083 --> 27:32.476
Teeth falling out
is actually a common dream.

27:33.390 --> 27:35.697
Your teeth
may represent your anxiety

27:35.741 --> 27:39.092
about your appearance
and how others perceive you.

27:41.355 --> 27:43.444
I like how others perceive me.

27:44.706 --> 27:46.360
And how is that?

27:47.666 --> 27:48.623
With desire.

27:58.111 --> 28:01.984
There's a Goya etching,
Caza de Dientes.

28:02.028 --> 28:03.507
You should check it out.

28:12.081 --> 28:13.866
-Hey, you.
-Hey.

28:13.909 --> 28:15.084
So what do you think?

28:15.128 --> 28:17.783
-Of us lab rats?
-Yeah.

28:19.088 --> 28:21.177
I'm still trying
to find my way out.

29:28.723 --> 29:31.508
Hey, brought you
an afternoon treat.

29:33.597 --> 29:35.512
You're such a sweetheart.

29:35.556 --> 29:37.297
I figured you could use it.

29:37.340 --> 29:38.472
Thank you.

29:39.647 --> 29:41.431
I'm--

29:41.475 --> 29:44.391
I'm sorry about the other day.
It won't happen again.

29:44.434 --> 29:45.784
No, I'm sorry.

29:46.436 --> 29:47.873
I agreed to be a part of this,

29:47.916 --> 29:50.049
and I just really hope
that it helps.

29:51.311 --> 29:54.009
-Ooh. Oh, hi, Rich.
- Hey!

29:54.053 --> 29:56.185
I see you're taking good care
of our girl.

29:56.229 --> 29:58.100
-Ah, always.

29:58.144 --> 29:59.841
Tsk, Leigh's wonderful.

29:59.885 --> 30:01.843
We're really gonna miss
having her here.

30:03.410 --> 30:04.890
I'm gonna go grab some lunch.

30:04.933 --> 30:06.282
I'll see you guys later.

30:08.241 --> 30:09.764
What's she talking about?

30:09.808 --> 30:12.201
I haven't said anything yet
just because it's not final,

30:12.245 --> 30:15.901
but that non-profit
that I wanna open upstate,

30:15.944 --> 30:17.816
it looks like I may have found
a sponsor.

30:17.859 --> 30:20.122
That's great.

30:20.166 --> 30:21.515
Were you gonna tell me?

30:21.558 --> 30:23.473
Of course. I--

30:23.517 --> 30:26.346
I just really wanted
to see what happened first.

30:26.389 --> 30:27.608
Sure.

30:30.480 --> 30:33.875
- What are you drawing?
- Aren't you nosey?

30:35.398 --> 30:37.052
Boop.

32:43.613 --> 32:45.702
This is-- Don't you knock?

32:45.746 --> 32:47.400
This-- This is a classroom.

32:47.443 --> 32:50.011
Listen, buddy.
This has never happened before.

32:50.055 --> 32:52.318
This just happened to me.

32:53.406 --> 32:56.017
You better hope, for your sake,
nobody finds out about this.

32:58.063 --> 33:01.849
I could make this
very hard for you.

33:03.807 --> 33:05.113
- Gentlemen.

33:05.157 --> 33:06.288
- Mona.

33:06.332 --> 33:07.898
Hey.

33:07.942 --> 33:10.075
Rich, uh, could I
speak to you for a minute?

33:10.118 --> 33:11.293
-Sure.
-Excuse us, Charlie.

33:11.337 --> 33:13.165
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

33:13.208 --> 33:15.776
Is your final focus group ready?

33:15.819 --> 33:19.171
-I started the fMRI today.
- Excellent.

33:44.935 --> 33:48.200
-You need help?
-Oh, you scared me.

33:48.243 --> 33:49.375
Sorry.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.552
What are you up to?

33:52.595 --> 33:55.120
Actually, I was looking
for that etching you mentioned.

33:56.338 --> 33:58.993
-Oh, the Goya one?
-Yeah. I--

33:59.037 --> 34:00.647
Here, let me help you.

34:12.876 --> 34:14.313
There it is.

34:14.965 --> 34:16.402
Wow.

34:17.881 --> 34:20.493
So you think
I should take a look at this

34:20.536 --> 34:23.931
because I have dreams
about my teeth falling out?

34:23.974 --> 34:27.326
It was your response
in how people perceive you.

34:27.369 --> 34:29.110
Oh, yeah.

34:29.154 --> 34:30.111
Desire.

34:31.591 --> 34:35.334
See, the woman in the etching,
she's the man's lover.

34:35.377 --> 34:36.900
So what?

34:36.944 --> 34:38.511
She isn't afraid
of being caught.

34:38.554 --> 34:41.166
She's afraid
of what she's doing to him.

34:41.209 --> 34:42.732
She's self-conscious.

34:44.169 --> 34:46.606
Even if you're confident
in how others perceive you,

34:46.649 --> 34:50.088
you're gonna be self-conscious
in another way.

34:52.699 --> 34:55.789
Maybe he wanted to be tied up.

34:57.399 --> 35:00.620
Possibly, but he's dead.

35:00.663 --> 35:03.449
Then she broke his trust.

35:06.321 --> 35:08.976
You ever tied anyone up?

35:10.543 --> 35:12.284
Excuse me?

35:12.327 --> 35:14.024
You should try it.

35:14.068 --> 35:16.592
I think you'd find it...
exciting.

35:18.986 --> 35:21.467
Sorry, I overstepped.

35:21.510 --> 35:25.123
No, it's interesting.
I've never, um--

35:27.603 --> 35:29.301
I've never done
anything like that.

35:31.041 --> 35:33.261
It is interesting.

35:55.327 --> 35:57.546
It's a really nice color on you.

35:57.590 --> 36:00.070
See, you're not so bad.

36:00.114 --> 36:02.421
-I'm glad you came.
-Me too.

36:03.900 --> 36:07.252
I haven't really spent time
in the art world.

36:07.295 --> 36:09.471
Oh, there's a lot of bullshit.

36:09.515 --> 36:12.170
Hipster doofuses,
artist wannabes.

36:13.823 --> 36:16.348
My masters were
Picasso and Bacon.

36:17.523 --> 36:20.700
I mean, here it's just a parade.

36:20.743 --> 36:23.529
Just a few of us trying
to turn our work into cash.

36:57.650 --> 37:00.130
I like how others perceive me.

37:00.174 --> 37:02.481
And how is that?

37:02.524 --> 37:04.091
With desire.

37:05.614 --> 37:09.575
There's a Goya etching,
Caza de Dientes.

37:09.618 --> 37:11.359
You should check it out.

37:13.753 --> 37:15.537
Don't you look nice.

37:16.625 --> 37:19.019
You should see
what I have on underneath.

38:14.161 --> 38:15.510
I had an attack the other night.

38:18.948 --> 38:21.037
-Were your teeth falling out?
- No.

38:22.387 --> 38:24.606
This was
a different kind of dream.

38:27.392 --> 38:28.523
Nothing leaves this room.

38:31.309 --> 38:32.875
I began to fantasize.

38:39.969 --> 38:41.144
I was walking down the hall...

38:45.105 --> 38:48.761
And I came to a room.

38:50.850 --> 38:52.591
I laid down on the bed.

38:53.679 --> 38:56.072
Then hands were around my neck.

38:57.422 --> 38:59.119
And I liked it.

39:00.903 --> 39:04.254
But when they tightened, I...

39:04.298 --> 39:07.606
suddenly was awake...

39:07.649 --> 39:11.479
in my room, unable to move,
and I couldn't breathe.

39:14.264 --> 39:16.745
-How did you feel?
- I don't know.

39:18.312 --> 39:19.748
I love being touched,

39:21.184 --> 39:23.099
but I don't like
not being in control.

39:25.319 --> 39:26.842
Perhaps you need trust.

39:29.367 --> 39:30.455
Perhaps.

39:37.157 --> 39:39.638
Maybe you were...

39:39.681 --> 39:42.858
repressing an aspect
of your self-expression.

39:44.643 --> 39:46.993
I don't think
that's the problem.

39:48.211 --> 39:50.518
I have a notebook here
for each of you...

39:52.781 --> 39:56.089
...to record
your sleep experiences

39:56.132 --> 39:57.743
just after they happen.

41:58.516 --> 41:59.952
- Hey, hey.
-Jesus!

41:59.995 --> 42:01.562
What are you-- What?

42:01.606 --> 42:03.782
-What are you up to?

42:03.825 --> 42:06.654
I just got off work.
I'm going home now.

42:06.698 --> 42:07.525
Want me to join you?

42:08.700 --> 42:11.137
No, not tonight.
I'm really tired.

42:12.965 --> 42:13.966
Where you've been?

42:15.402 --> 42:18.579
Work, school, blow-jobs.

42:18.623 --> 42:19.885
The usual.

42:20.973 --> 42:23.541
Well, you've been busy
with Professor Freeman.

42:24.411 --> 42:27.806
That'd make sense.
I'm in his study.

42:27.849 --> 42:29.590
But you already knew that.

42:30.199 --> 42:31.636
Professor Freeman.

42:32.854 --> 42:33.899
Do you like him?

42:36.031 --> 42:37.511
He's a great teacher.

42:38.817 --> 42:40.427
Am I a great teacher?

42:41.733 --> 42:42.908
What do you want?

42:52.918 --> 42:55.050
Remember that?

42:55.094 --> 42:56.312

45:08.009 --> 45:09.619
I heard you were around here.

45:09.663 --> 45:12.797
Oh! There he is.
I was hoping to run into you.

45:12.840 --> 45:14.929
-How you doing?
-I'm well. I'm well.

45:14.973 --> 45:16.496
-How are you?
- I'm good.

45:16.539 --> 45:17.976
Good. Good.

45:18.019 --> 45:20.761
I hear you're running
full steam ahead with Vorous.

45:20.805 --> 45:22.154
Gotta pay
for my research somehow.

45:22.197 --> 45:23.808
Oh.

45:23.851 --> 45:25.984
Yeah. Anymore thoughts?

45:26.027 --> 45:27.986
-About what?
-Albany.

45:29.639 --> 45:31.337
I'm flattered, but why me?

45:31.380 --> 45:33.339
Why-- why do you want me
so badly?

45:34.209 --> 45:35.950
Well...

45:35.994 --> 45:37.473
Hmm, we had this patient.

45:37.517 --> 45:41.086
He was a combat vet
who had PTSD,

45:41.129 --> 45:42.740
and he was having
terrible nightmares

45:43.392 --> 45:45.003
to the point
where he was never sleeping

45:45.046 --> 45:47.092
and he'd lost
all track of reality.

45:49.355 --> 45:51.531
And last week he killed himself.

45:52.924 --> 45:54.621
Now, I'm not telling you this
to guilt you,

45:54.664 --> 45:57.102
but-- but when you were
my student in the lab,

45:57.145 --> 45:59.278
I knew that you could make
a difference.

45:59.931 --> 46:01.149
'Cause you weren't brought up

46:01.193 --> 46:02.498
like all the other Charlie's
in the world.

46:03.282 --> 46:05.806
You know
how the other half lives.

46:05.850 --> 46:07.677
I have to see
this study through.

46:08.896 --> 46:10.289
Of course.

46:12.378 --> 46:13.901
How are you doing
with your dreams?

46:15.860 --> 46:17.165
Are you remembering them now?

46:18.688 --> 46:20.038
Pieces.

46:38.273 --> 46:40.014
Why are you always late
to my class?

46:40.058 --> 46:42.712
What are you doing all night?

46:42.756 --> 46:46.891
I'm a sexual pain exploration
specialist.

46:46.934 --> 46:48.849
I work at a club on Tenth Ave.

46:50.895 --> 46:52.722
What is that?

46:52.766 --> 46:56.074
I help people explore parts
of their sexuality

46:56.117 --> 46:57.510
they didn't know existed.

46:59.294 --> 47:01.253
They call me Alethia.

47:03.429 --> 47:04.517
Oh.

47:05.779 --> 47:07.607
I'm not a whore.

47:07.650 --> 47:09.217
I don't sleep with anyone
for money.

47:09.261 --> 47:10.653
I didn't say that.

47:10.697 --> 47:12.133
But you might have
been thinking it.

47:14.788 --> 47:17.704
You're one
of my brightest students.

47:17.747 --> 47:18.923
Don't you find that...

47:18.966 --> 47:20.098
-Degrading?
-Uh...

47:21.099 --> 47:23.536
Look, I enjoy what I do.

47:23.579 --> 47:26.844
Intelligence
and sexual enjoyment

47:26.887 --> 47:28.846
are not mutually exclusive.

47:32.675 --> 47:34.634
Would you ask
the same question to a man?

47:39.030 --> 47:40.466
So you and Charlie...

47:41.554 --> 47:44.949
Let's just say
he likes it too rough.

47:47.516 --> 47:48.648
Rough how?

47:50.737 --> 47:52.521
He has to be in control.

47:53.740 --> 47:54.828
Physically.

47:58.005 --> 47:59.267
What about you?

48:01.269 --> 48:04.142
Is there anything
you wanna explore?

48:11.584 --> 48:13.412
You know what I write
about in my notebook?

48:15.196 --> 48:16.110
What?

48:18.156 --> 48:20.245
You and me...

48:22.856 --> 48:24.466
exploring.

48:38.437 --> 48:40.091
Do I make you nervous?

48:42.006 --> 48:43.224
No.

49:00.894 --> 49:03.288
I guess
I'll just be your fantasy.

49:32.839 --> 49:33.883
Could I help you?

49:36.451 --> 49:38.497
Alethia?

49:38.540 --> 49:40.542
Your sub has arrived.

49:40.586 --> 49:41.761
Show him in.

49:51.162 --> 49:52.467
Take a seat.

50:27.459 --> 50:28.286
Stop.

50:33.856 --> 50:35.293
I told you to stop.

53:18.760 --> 53:19.935
Hi.

54:16.383 --> 54:18.951
- You look good.
- We did it.

54:19.821 --> 54:21.910
-We did what?
-The nightmare.

54:23.085 --> 54:25.262
I'm in control of it now.

54:25.305 --> 54:27.525
-We're a good team, Rich.

54:27.568 --> 54:29.222
I'm flattered,
but what happened?

54:30.441 --> 54:33.182
Was the woman
in your dream in control?

54:33.748 --> 54:35.184
No, I took care of it.

54:39.580 --> 54:42.366
Could she have been your mother?

54:43.018 --> 54:44.063
Mm.

54:46.239 --> 54:47.458
No, not possible.

54:48.807 --> 54:50.852
- Why?
- She's dead.

54:53.377 --> 54:54.682
I was a foster child.

55:04.910 --> 55:06.346
What happened to your parents?

55:08.479 --> 55:12.221
Well, in my dream, I--

55:12.265 --> 55:14.006
I strangled the life out of her.

55:29.891 --> 55:31.545
Officers, uh, one

55:31.589 --> 55:34.679
of our top forensic researchers,
Dr. Charles Engel.

55:34.722 --> 55:36.637
Charlie,
this is Detective Jacobs

55:36.681 --> 55:38.117
and Sergeant Costello.

55:38.160 --> 55:39.727
-Nice to meet you.
-Same here.

55:39.771 --> 55:42.208
Um, actually,
I worked on a case you did

55:42.251 --> 55:43.905
for, uh, DA Bradley.

55:43.949 --> 55:45.907
-Ah, yeah.
-Yeah, nice work.

55:45.951 --> 55:48.040
Happy to help.
Nice to meet you, guys.

55:48.083 --> 55:49.346
-All right. You too.
- Mona.

55:56.527 --> 55:58.050
Dean Gaslow.

55:58.093 --> 56:02.707
So what can you tell us
about Jo Rodney?

56:03.360 --> 56:07.146
She's a student of mine
in my intro class this semester.

56:07.189 --> 56:09.888
She's-- She's a good student.
What? Is she in trouble?

56:09.931 --> 56:11.977
She was found dead
early this morning.

56:13.848 --> 56:15.502
Looks like she was murdered.

56:17.852 --> 56:20.855
We found a notebook
in her apartment

56:20.899 --> 56:24.119
that appears to have been given
to her by you.

56:24.642 --> 56:27.427
You wanna tell us
anything about that?

56:27.471 --> 56:30.299
A notebook? Uh...

56:30.343 --> 56:31.779
That's right.
I did give her a notebook.

56:31.823 --> 56:33.477
She's in my study

56:33.520 --> 56:36.871
on nightmares, dreams
and sleep paralysis.

56:36.915 --> 56:39.004
I'm sorry, sleep paralysis?

56:39.047 --> 56:42.007
Yes. It's like a nightmare,
except it happens

56:42.050 --> 56:44.226
as you're waking up
or falling asleep.

56:44.270 --> 56:46.533
So what-- what is that?
More like a...

56:46.577 --> 56:48.535
What, like flashbacks?

56:48.579 --> 56:51.799
Sure. It's not uncommon
in victims with PTSD.

56:52.626 --> 56:54.367
Getting back to Jo, Dr. Freeman,

56:54.411 --> 56:57.109
did you ever meet with her
outside of the study?

57:00.155 --> 57:01.853
She would come to my office.

57:03.376 --> 57:06.945
Do you have any idea what she
wrote about in her notebook?

57:06.988 --> 57:10.688
No. Not really. Uh...

57:10.731 --> 57:12.559
We haven't disclosed
the information

57:12.603 --> 57:15.954
from their notebooks yet
in the study.

57:15.997 --> 57:17.695
No or not really?

57:18.696 --> 57:19.827
No.

57:21.394 --> 57:22.526
There was another girl attacked
up in this neighborhood

57:22.569 --> 57:23.657
a couple of weeks ago.

57:23.701 --> 57:24.876
They're related?

57:24.919 --> 57:26.617
I don't know. Could be.

57:26.660 --> 57:28.836
Well, we definitely need
everyone to, you know,

57:28.880 --> 57:31.230
keep their ears and eyes open.

57:31.273 --> 57:34.407
Um, here's my card.

57:34.451 --> 57:37.192
Feel free to call me
if you think of anything else

57:37.236 --> 57:38.498
that might be helpful.

57:38.542 --> 57:39.978
I will.

57:40.021 --> 57:42.371
Dean, thank you for your time.

57:42.415 --> 57:43.416
-Thank you.
-Thanks, Dean.

57:43.460 --> 57:44.678
Thanks.

57:51.468 --> 57:54.471
I don't mean to be insensitive,

57:54.514 --> 57:56.255
but I need you to finish.

57:57.691 --> 58:00.607
I've invested my credibility,

58:00.651 --> 58:03.958
and quite frankly, so have you.

58:09.964 --> 58:11.270
Well, the woman, she's--

58:12.445 --> 58:13.664
she's pinned to the bed,

58:13.707 --> 58:15.753
which makes sense
in the painting.

58:16.928 --> 58:18.538
You think she should be pinned?

58:18.582 --> 58:19.800
Naturally.

58:22.063 --> 58:23.195
Hey.

58:23.891 --> 58:25.414
What's with you tonight?

58:26.372 --> 58:29.157
-I need to talk to you.
-Is everything okay?

58:31.595 --> 58:34.336
-It's serious.
-What happened?

58:34.380 --> 58:36.991
Detectives stopped
by my office earlier today.

58:37.035 --> 58:39.690
-Detectives?
-They were asking me about Jo.

58:39.733 --> 58:42.475
-And?

58:42.519 --> 58:43.650
She's dead.

58:43.694 --> 58:45.609
Wait, what?

58:45.652 --> 58:47.175
She was found murdered.

58:47.219 --> 58:49.743
Wha-- Wait, Jo was murdered?

58:53.094 --> 58:54.574
I feel horrible right now.

58:54.618 --> 58:57.359
Hey, this--
this is not your fault.

58:59.144 --> 59:01.886
In my last session with Otis,

59:01.929 --> 59:03.583
right before the police
showed up...

59:05.454 --> 59:08.675
he described strangling a woman.

59:08.719 --> 59:09.676
What?

59:09.720 --> 59:10.982
He said it was just a dream,

59:11.025 --> 59:12.723
but still, the timing...

59:18.076 --> 59:20.034
He was a foster child.

59:20.078 --> 59:22.602
Just because he's in the system,
it doesn't make him a murderer.

59:22.646 --> 59:24.169
No, that's not what I'm saying.

59:25.518 --> 59:29.261
I'm hoping to find out
more about him.

59:32.351 --> 59:34.309
Detective Jacobs.

59:34.353 --> 59:35.659
-Dr. Engel.
-Hey.

59:35.702 --> 59:37.661
-How are you? Good to see you.
-You too.

59:37.704 --> 59:39.663
Hey, uh, are you guys
investigating

59:39.706 --> 59:41.665
Jo Rodney's murder?

59:41.708 --> 59:44.493
You got something you wanna
tell us, or what's-- what's up?

59:44.537 --> 59:45.799
Listen, this isn't
public knowledge,

59:45.843 --> 59:49.411
but Rich Freeman has been known
to, you know,

59:49.455 --> 59:52.023
cross a line or two
with a few of his students.

59:53.285 --> 59:55.330
Students like Jo Rodney?

59:55.374 --> 59:57.724
Yeah, I mean, one time,
I did walk into his office,

59:57.768 --> 59:59.944
and they were, you know,
I don't know, in the moment.

59:59.987 --> 1:00:01.859
I mean, I feel bad
even saying this,

1:00:01.902 --> 1:00:04.470
but I feel like I have to,
and I--

1:00:05.689 --> 1:00:07.429
Dr. Freeman was with her.

1:00:07.473 --> 1:00:09.780
I saw them at dinner
the night that she was killed.

1:00:10.868 --> 1:00:12.130
Wow.

1:00:14.175 --> 1:00:15.786
Uh, an- anything else or...

1:00:16.874 --> 1:00:20.181
I don't-- Um, I mean,
I've seen some things

1:00:20.225 --> 1:00:22.227
in his office sometimes.

1:00:22.270 --> 1:00:23.445
What kinds of things?

1:00:24.316 --> 1:00:26.884
You know, girls' personal items.

1:00:29.930 --> 1:00:32.716
Well, uh,
thank you for your help.

1:00:32.759 --> 1:00:34.543
- Thank you, doctor.
-Thank-- thank you.

1:00:34.587 --> 1:00:35.936
Appreciate it. Thank you.

1:00:35.980 --> 1:00:37.285
Good--
Good luck with everything.

1:00:42.029 --> 1:00:43.291
Let's go pick up Freeman.

1:00:44.684 --> 1:00:45.816
You think he did it?

1:00:46.947 --> 1:00:47.861
You don't?

1:00:56.565 --> 1:00:59.133
-Here, I never showed you this.
- I appreciate it.

1:01:04.486 --> 1:01:05.357
Where's his history?

1:01:06.663 --> 1:01:08.316
Beyond the basic stats,
it's a sealed file.

1:01:08.360 --> 1:01:10.405
No birth record, nothing.

1:01:10.449 --> 1:01:11.885
And his parents?

1:01:11.929 --> 1:01:13.626
He was listed as a ward
of the state in foster care

1:01:13.670 --> 1:01:14.671
till he was 18.

1:01:18.326 --> 1:01:21.025
Who exactly becomes
wards of the state?

1:01:21.068 --> 1:01:22.809
Well, it could be any number
of situations.

1:01:22.853 --> 1:01:26.508
Parents with drug addiction,
in prison, death.

1:01:28.510 --> 1:01:30.208
Is that his case officer?

1:01:30.251 --> 1:01:32.732
-Come, have a seat.
-Thanks for meeting with me.

1:01:34.038 --> 1:01:35.953
So...

1:01:35.996 --> 1:01:38.607
Otis Breathlen
is a patient of yours?

1:01:38.651 --> 1:01:41.480
Yes, I've been working with him
for a few weeks,

1:01:41.523 --> 1:01:44.788
and I'm concerned
about his emotional well-being.

1:01:45.789 --> 1:01:47.312
What are your concerns?

1:01:47.355 --> 1:01:49.444
Well, he hasn't opened up
quite yet,

1:01:49.488 --> 1:01:52.186
and frankly, I'm concerned
about his safety.

1:01:56.060 --> 1:01:58.279
His mother was a prostitute.

1:01:59.063 --> 1:02:02.762
She did her business
inside the apartment.

1:02:02.806 --> 1:02:05.547
Eventually, she died
of a drug overdose.

1:02:06.113 --> 1:02:10.074
That's when Otis became
the responsibility of the state,

1:02:10.117 --> 1:02:12.641
and I looked over him
until he was 18.

1:02:14.121 --> 1:02:15.427
That's horrible.

1:02:16.036 --> 1:02:18.343
Tsk. Yeah.

1:02:19.213 --> 1:02:22.086
When he was 13,
there was a report

1:02:22.129 --> 1:02:25.785
that Otis had been raped
by another boy in foster care.

1:02:27.526 --> 1:02:30.659
Later, there was a fire,
and his foster home burned down.

1:02:31.835 --> 1:02:34.838
The foster family
and two other children

1:02:34.881 --> 1:02:36.709
died in the fire.

1:02:36.753 --> 1:02:38.232
Jesus.

1:02:38.276 --> 1:02:40.408
We could never prove it, but...

1:02:41.453 --> 1:02:46.110
we think Otis
may be responsible for the fire.

1:02:51.158 --> 1:02:53.508
And how could they
never prove it?

1:02:53.552 --> 1:02:55.380
Rich, just stop.

1:02:55.423 --> 1:02:58.035
I showed you his file,
and now you're just scaring me.

1:02:58.078 --> 1:02:59.340
You have no idea
what's going on.

1:03:00.689 --> 1:03:03.301
Dr. Freeman. How are you, sir?

1:03:03.344 --> 1:03:05.999
- Detectives.
-I'm sorry to disturb you guys.

1:03:06.043 --> 1:03:08.219
Uh, we just have
a couple of follow-up questions

1:03:08.262 --> 1:03:09.481
about Jo Rodney.

1:03:09.524 --> 1:03:10.961
Sure. Yeah.

1:03:11.004 --> 1:03:13.180
Would you like to step aside
with us for a moment?

1:03:13.224 --> 1:03:14.747
No, I'm good. What's going on?

1:03:15.269 --> 1:03:19.273
Uh, doctor, you mentioned
that, um, you and Jo

1:03:19.317 --> 1:03:21.928
would, uh, meet sometimes
in your office

1:03:21.972 --> 1:03:24.626
while she was participating
in the study.

1:03:24.670 --> 1:03:26.454
Yes.

1:03:26.498 --> 1:03:28.935
Ever been to an S&M club
over on Tenth Avenue?

1:03:32.809 --> 1:03:34.158
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1:03:34.898 --> 1:03:35.812
You never been?

1:03:37.944 --> 1:03:39.859
-Never.
- Good.

1:03:39.903 --> 1:03:41.861
Well, that's--
that's all we got.

1:03:41.905 --> 1:03:43.341
-Okay.
-Thank you for your time.

1:03:43.384 --> 1:03:45.386
-Thank you. Thank you.
-You guys have a good evening.

1:03:45.430 --> 1:03:46.910
-Nice to meet you, ma'am.
-You too.

1:03:49.303 --> 1:03:51.828
-Let's go.

1:03:52.654 --> 1:03:53.786
Yeah?

1:03:57.094 --> 1:03:57.921
Yeah.

1:03:59.661 --> 1:04:00.837
Okay, thanks.

1:04:01.881 --> 1:04:03.100
Shayna's out of the coma.

1:04:03.143 --> 1:04:04.884
We gotta get over
to the hospital.

1:04:04.928 --> 1:04:06.668
You know what? You go.

1:04:06.712 --> 1:04:08.670
I'm gonna keep my eyes
on this good doctor.

1:04:19.725 --> 1:04:22.423
Hey. How are you?

1:04:22.467 --> 1:04:23.903
How you doing? Are you okay?

1:04:23.947 --> 1:04:25.687
-Yeah.
- Good. You look good.

1:04:25.731 --> 1:04:28.125
-Good. Um, what do you got here?

1:04:29.517 --> 1:04:31.171
Thank you.

1:04:41.660 --> 1:04:43.227
Um, I'm gonna have
to take this with me.

1:04:43.270 --> 1:04:45.098
You look good.

1:04:45.142 --> 1:04:46.143
Okay, thanks.

1:04:48.406 --> 1:04:50.147
So this wood
really balances out

1:04:50.190 --> 1:04:51.888
some of the lighter
and darker elements.

1:04:51.931 --> 1:04:53.585
How do you feel about it?

1:04:56.283 --> 1:04:59.243
Oh, just excuse me
for just one minute.

1:04:59.286 --> 1:05:01.201
Here he is,
the man of the moment.

1:05:01.245 --> 1:05:02.942
Hey, Jeff,
I need to talk to you.

1:05:02.986 --> 1:05:05.771
Uh, one minute.
I have to show you something.

1:05:05.814 --> 1:05:08.556
Please come with me.
I have to show you this.

1:05:08.600 --> 1:05:10.080
You did it.

1:05:10.123 --> 1:05:11.168
It's all you.

1:05:35.061 --> 1:05:36.193
So what do you think?

1:05:38.021 --> 1:05:41.676
It's definitely different
than your earlier work.

1:05:41.720 --> 1:05:43.852
You should stop
by my loft tonight.

1:05:44.941 --> 1:05:46.551
See the rest of the series.

1:05:46.594 --> 1:05:47.987
I haven't even seen them.

1:05:48.031 --> 1:05:50.381
I'd like to show Rich.

1:05:50.424 --> 1:05:51.686
Yeah, uh...

1:05:53.210 --> 1:05:54.646
Yeah, I'll see you
later tonight.

1:06:05.091 --> 1:06:06.179
Where are you going?

1:06:07.180 --> 1:06:10.140
To Otis's.
I need to see the paintings.

1:06:10.183 --> 1:06:12.664
Why?

1:06:12.707 --> 1:06:14.622
-I need to know.
- Know what?

1:06:14.666 --> 1:06:17.799
-I need to make this right.
- Rich.

1:06:17.843 --> 1:06:19.149
Stop lying to me.

1:06:19.192 --> 1:06:20.933
Why were the police asking you

1:06:20.977 --> 1:06:24.154
about some S&M club
that Jo worked at?

1:06:24.197 --> 1:06:27.244
I guess she worked there
as a dominatrix.

1:06:27.287 --> 1:06:29.202
So why were they asking you
about it?

1:06:29.246 --> 1:06:31.639
I have no idea. Maybe
because she was my student?

1:06:34.816 --> 1:06:36.209
-Were you fucking her?
- What?

1:06:36.993 --> 1:06:38.516
What is it you think you heard?

1:06:38.559 --> 1:06:40.953
-Don't touch me.
- Okay.

1:06:43.347 --> 1:06:44.913
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

1:06:44.957 --> 1:06:47.220
Why were the police
asking you about Jo?

1:06:50.397 --> 1:06:52.878
I was with Jo the night
she was murdered.

1:06:54.836 --> 1:06:56.534
What do you mean
you were with Jo?

1:06:56.577 --> 1:06:58.101
We had dinner.

1:06:59.015 --> 1:07:01.278
So then what did you do?

1:07:01.321 --> 1:07:02.801
She kissed me.

1:07:07.240 --> 1:07:08.241
What else?

1:07:11.505 --> 1:07:12.854
Leigh, please.

1:07:12.898 --> 1:07:14.030
What else?

1:09:35.910 --> 1:09:37.173
Otis?

1:10:45.458 --> 1:10:50.724
Well, in my dream, I--
I strangle the life out of her.

1:11:16.663 --> 1:11:18.578
You can put your hands
around my neck.

1:11:21.625 --> 1:11:22.582
It's okay.

1:13:21.962 --> 1:13:22.789
The nightmare.

1:13:24.095 --> 1:13:25.792
I'm in control of it now.

1:13:26.402 --> 1:13:27.707
We're a good team, Rich.

1:13:34.105 --> 1:13:36.455
It's like a nightmare,
except it happens

1:13:36.499 --> 1:13:38.326
as you're waking up
or falling asleep.

1:14:01.915 --> 1:14:03.787
- Where you going?
- I need to get home.

1:14:03.830 --> 1:14:05.441
I don't think so.
I don't think so.

1:14:05.484 --> 1:14:07.355
You need to go back upstairs.
We gotta have a conversation.

1:14:07.399 --> 1:14:08.618
-Whoa! Hey!
- I need to get home!

1:14:08.661 --> 1:14:09.749
If you touch me...

1:14:09.793 --> 1:14:10.881
Let's move back up.

1:14:44.131 --> 1:14:45.393
Engel!

1:15:05.413 --> 1:15:06.632
It's Jacobs.

1:16:05.909 --> 1:16:07.301
-Let's go.

1:16:09.826 --> 1:16:11.262
What happened to you?

1:16:11.305 --> 1:16:12.785
I'm fine.

1:16:12.829 --> 1:16:14.395
-Yeah?

1:16:14.439 --> 1:16:16.180
I got this prick on resisting.

1:16:17.181 --> 1:16:18.399
Hey...

1:16:19.575 --> 1:16:23.579
Everything we got
points to Engel.

1:16:23.622 --> 1:16:24.623
Engel?

1:17:03.488 --> 1:17:04.837
Going somewhere?

1:17:07.318 --> 1:17:09.189
What does it look like?

1:17:09.233 --> 1:17:13.585
You can't.
It'll hurt the university.

1:17:13.629 --> 1:17:15.674
We can't claim the grant
without you.

1:17:19.765 --> 1:17:21.201
I made you.

1:17:34.780 --> 1:17:36.695
When you were
a student of mine in the lab,

1:17:36.739 --> 1:17:38.654
I thought that you could really make a difference.

1:17:40.830 --> 1:17:42.832
I have to see
this study through.

1:17:42.875 --> 1:17:44.442
Of course.

1:17:46.444 --> 1:17:48.185
How are you doing
with your dreams?

1:17:48.228 --> 1:17:49.969
Are you remembering them now?

1:18:37.147 --> 1:18:38.409
I have these nightmares.

1:18:40.585 --> 1:18:42.587
I'm... asleep.

1:18:42.630 --> 1:18:44.415
I-- I think I'm awake,

1:18:45.242 --> 1:18:46.417
