Previously on 90210:
What kind of movies
does your dad produce?

00:04.922 --> 00:07.508
Porn. He's the biggest producer
of x-rated movies in the world.

00:07.633 --> 00:09.217
TEDDY:
I found this homeless guy.

00:09.343 --> 00:11.720
He'd been mowed over
by a hit-and-run driver.

00:11.846 --> 00:13.138
Do you remember
your first time here?

00:13.263 --> 00:15.975
Sort of.
We both ended up
down here, and

00:16.099 --> 00:17.518
before we knew
what was happening...

00:17.643 --> 00:20.521
Uh, yeah, I should, um,
go give this to my boyfriend.

00:20.646 --> 00:21.438
I'm Dixon, by the way.

00:21.563 --> 00:22.606
I'm Sasha.

00:22.731 --> 00:24.900
So, you DJ?
I do.

00:25.024 --> 00:27.444
You know, I'm...
I'm in the music business.

00:27.569 --> 00:29.404
I didn't want to tell Naomi
what happened between us,

00:29.530 --> 00:31.365
because she was done
with me, but she's not.

00:31.490 --> 00:33.033
And she needs to
know the truth.

00:33.158 --> 00:34.910
And when I deny it, who do
you think she's gonna believe?

00:35.035 --> 00:37.037
What do you two want?
Naomi, we need
to tell you

00:37.162 --> 00:39.373
the truth about that night--
we totally slept together.

00:39.498 --> 00:41.500
...back on me
now. No! No!
Naomi, She's lying to you.

00:41.625 --> 00:42.710
SASHA: Might want
to click that,

00:42.835 --> 00:43.794
'cause we're going to Napa.

00:43.919 --> 00:45.921
(engine revving)

00:56.348 --> 00:57.808
Mmm.

00:57.933 --> 00:59.560
(laughs)

00:59.685 --> 01:00.644
This is incredible.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.354
Mm.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.438
You are incredible.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.317
Uh...
(snaps fingers)

01:07.442 --> 01:08.819
(gasps)

01:10.404 --> 01:13.991
I want...

01:14.115 --> 01:15.910
Ooh... I want
what's under there.

01:20.372 --> 01:21.790
Hey.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.585
I got a treat for you.

01:33.343 --> 01:35.303
NAVID:
Hey?

01:35.429 --> 01:38.306
Hey.

01:38.432 --> 01:39.767
You okay, sweetie?

01:39.892 --> 01:41.309
Yeah.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.644
Yeah, I just... I...

01:42.770 --> 01:43.771
I guess I fell asleep.

01:43.896 --> 01:45.230
Ooh!

01:45.355 --> 01:46.732
How could you

01:46.857 --> 01:48.442
when it's so positively
thrilling around here?

01:48.567 --> 01:49.651
Oh, don't get me wrong.

01:49.777 --> 01:50.819
Love working weekends.

01:50.945 --> 01:51.987
Just wish
it was a three-day weekend,

01:52.112 --> 01:53.906
you know, so I could
give more to the Blaze.

01:54.031 --> 01:56.241
Yeah, thanks. It's the kind of
sarcasm I need from my staff.

01:56.366 --> 01:57.242
Thanks.

01:57.367 --> 01:58.827
Oh, Chinese food!
Chinese food!

01:58.953 --> 02:00.287
Keep ordering from Mr. Chow,

02:00.412 --> 02:02.163
and I will work any Sunday
you want, boss.

02:02.289 --> 02:03.749
Perfect.
Your boyfriend rocks,
by the way.

02:03.874 --> 02:05.166
(laughs)
I know.

02:05.292 --> 02:06.334
I rock.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.586
He totally rocks.

02:07.711 --> 02:09.670
(clears throat)

02:21.141 --> 02:23.310
Mm, I love the
bass on this part.

02:23.435 --> 02:25.353
Yeah, it's, like,
boom, boom, boom.

02:25.479 --> 02:26.647
Right?

02:26.772 --> 02:28.774
Boom, boom, boom.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.651
Boom, boom, boom.

02:30.776 --> 02:33.236
(laughs)

02:38.700 --> 02:40.452
(phone ringing)

02:40.577 --> 02:42.871
(sighs)

02:42.997 --> 02:44.289
Ooh!
Oh!

02:44.414 --> 02:45.499
Oh.
Sorry.

02:45.624 --> 02:46.708
Yeah.
Oh.

02:46.834 --> 02:47.793
(laughs)
One second.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.544
Oh.

02:49.670 --> 02:50.796
It's Navid.

02:50.921 --> 02:52.631
Oh, again?
Yeah.

02:52.756 --> 02:55.467
I got to tell you, that guy
is dedicated to his job.

02:55.592 --> 02:56.802
(both laughing)

02:56.927 --> 02:58.887
Yeah, I think
I better take this one.

02:59.013 --> 03:01.890
Oh, well, I will
take a shower.

03:02.016 --> 03:03.809
Yes, because
you are a dirty girl.

03:03.934 --> 03:05.268
Mm, filthy.

03:05.393 --> 03:07.228
(laughs)

03:14.653 --> 03:15.696
What's up?

03:15.821 --> 03:18.239
A couples' massage?

03:18.365 --> 03:19.867
You got a $400 couples' massage?

03:19.992 --> 03:22.410
I just checked
my credit card charges online.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.329
Navid, uh, you know, feel free

03:24.454 --> 03:26.915
to take the rest of the
night off, you know,

03:27.041 --> 03:28.917
uh, you've worked
hard enough this week.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.085
Yeah, I've been working hard.

03:30.209 --> 03:32.129
I'm sorry to be the bearer
of a reality check,

03:32.253 --> 03:33.463
but have you lost
your freaking mind?

03:33.588 --> 03:34.673
Sort of.

03:34.798 --> 03:35.716
(laughs)
Oh, man.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.300
All right, look.

03:37.425 --> 03:39.427
I'll pay you back
for the couples' massage,

03:39.553 --> 03:41.304
all right?
But I'm telling you,

03:41.429 --> 03:42.681
it was worth it.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.808
Navid, my friend,

03:44.933 --> 03:47.019
I am living the dream.

03:47.144 --> 03:50.105
Uh, Dixon, my friend,
you are living a lie.

03:50.271 --> 03:52.399
(shower running in distance)
Look, I'm going to come clean.

03:52.524 --> 03:54.442
When?

03:54.568 --> 03:55.986
I don't know. Um, later.

03:56.111 --> 03:57.863
When the time is right.

03:57.988 --> 04:00.115
Okay, I don't know how you can
handle this stress, okay?

04:00.240 --> 04:01.742
I can't. I've got
sensitive skin, okay?

04:01.867 --> 04:03.618
And I'm, like, covered
with hives.

04:03.744 --> 04:04.953
Navid, all right, look, man,

04:05.079 --> 04:07.330
I'm sorry
I'm stressing you out, okay?

04:07.455 --> 04:08.999
I am very appreciative
for everything

04:09.124 --> 04:10.625
that you've been doing--
you know,

04:10.751 --> 04:12.335
loaning me your dad's car,

04:12.460 --> 04:14.838
renting out this hotel room
for us.

04:14.963 --> 04:15.964
Covering for you
with your parents.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.632
By the way,

04:17.757 --> 04:19.341
we've been working
on a science project

04:19.466 --> 04:20.510
involving the tsetse fly.

04:20.635 --> 04:21.720
The what what?

04:21.845 --> 04:22.971
The tsetse fly.

04:23.097 --> 04:24.514
Remember that. It's important

04:24.639 --> 04:26.474
to have details down
in case your dad asks on Monday.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.642
Oh, man, your dad.

04:27.768 --> 04:28.810
You better be in school
tomorrow,

04:28.936 --> 04:30.311
or else, I-I don't know
what I'll do.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.605
If-If he,
like, interrogates me,

04:31.730 --> 04:34.233
if he interrogates me,
I will so give you up.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.650
Navid!
NAVID:
I don't do well under pressure.

04:35.776 --> 04:36.985
This is why I couldn't be a spy.

04:37.111 --> 04:38.737
I get all hivey and honest.

04:38.862 --> 04:39.988
SASHA:
Dixon?!

04:40.114 --> 04:41.156
Come join me in the shower!

04:42.449 --> 04:43.742
I got to go.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.744
Dixon?

04:45.869 --> 04:47.537
Hello?

05:01.176 --> 05:03.637
What are you doing here?

05:03.762 --> 05:05.722
I'm meeting someone.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.599
Who? Annie the skank?

05:07.724 --> 05:08.767
(sighs)

05:08.892 --> 05:09.977
Teddy.

05:10.102 --> 05:11.686
We're going surfing.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.396
Look, none of what
Annie said on the boat

05:13.521 --> 05:15.440
was true-- none of it.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.025
We never had sex.

05:17.151 --> 05:20.528
Not a bunch of times, not once.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.697
Never.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.700
Naomi, you have to trust me.

05:27.119 --> 05:28.662
Trust you?

05:28.787 --> 05:30.371
That's a laugh.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.666
What do you know
about trust, huh?

05:32.791 --> 05:34.042
Trust

05:34.168 --> 05:36.753
is what Naomi
and I have.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.379
We look out
for each other.

05:38.505 --> 05:39.965
We take care
of each other.

05:40.090 --> 05:42.092
I can trust her,
she can trust me.

05:42.217 --> 05:44.970
And we both
can't trust you.

05:45.095 --> 05:46.387
Now shoo!

05:46.513 --> 05:47.889
Hasta luego.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.736
News alert!

06:01.862 --> 06:04.405
Four golf carts
were stolen

06:04.531 --> 06:06.365
from the Westwood
Country Club.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.620
Okay, it's a lame story.

06:10.745 --> 06:12.164
Um...

06:12.289 --> 06:15.125
Um, guys, I think
I got a good one.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.459
You remember that homeless guy
that was killed

06:16.584 --> 06:17.627
in the hit-and-run
on prom night?

06:17.752 --> 06:18.753
Yeah.

06:18.879 --> 06:19.754
The one that Teddy Montgomery

06:19.880 --> 06:20.839
found on the side of the road?

06:20.964 --> 06:22.674
Yeah. Why?
Oh, my God.

06:22.799 --> 06:23.884
SILVER:
What?

06:24.009 --> 06:24.885
GIA:
Whoa.
Gia!

06:25.010 --> 06:27.262
Sorry. Um...

06:27.386 --> 06:29.848
the homeless guy just donated
$100,000 to West Bev.

06:29.973 --> 06:31.099
What?

06:31.225 --> 06:32.809
Why?

06:32.934 --> 06:34.853
How does a homeless
guy have $100,000?

06:34.978 --> 06:36.146
Good questions.
Go find out.

06:36.271 --> 06:38.106
Silver, you report it;
Gia,

06:38.232 --> 06:39.649
produce the piece.
Yeah!

06:39.774 --> 06:41.109
(laughs)

06:41.235 --> 06:42.485
Sweet.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.952
CONSTANCE:
Adrianna.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.080
What's up, Mom?

06:53.205 --> 06:54.748
(sighs)

06:54.873 --> 06:56.124
Let's see.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.126
What are you doing?

06:58.252 --> 07:00.921
I'm just checking to make sure
you haven't injured your hand.

07:01.046 --> 07:02.463
Your fingers aren't broken,
are they?

07:02.589 --> 07:03.965
Uh... no.

07:04.091 --> 07:07.386
Then how come you haven't called
your agent in two weeks, huh?

07:07.510 --> 07:09.637
Mom, I told you
I am not auditioning.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.806
Whatever.
Luckily, I called her myself...

07:11.932 --> 07:14.893
and she got you an audition
for a mid-season pilot.

07:15.018 --> 07:16.477
Really?

07:16.603 --> 07:17.062
Yeah.

07:17.187 --> 07:19.981
Ugh.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.691
I'm not auditioning.

07:21.816 --> 07:22.984
Oh, God!

07:23.110 --> 07:24.986
Who do you think you are,
Julia Roberts?

07:25.112 --> 07:26.821
What's that supposed to mean?

07:26.947 --> 07:28.907
Elise said
that if you didn't show up

07:29.032 --> 07:30.575
to the audition,
she's dropping you

07:30.700 --> 07:31.743
for good.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.711
(clock alarm beeping)

07:41.836 --> 07:45.506
(sighs)

07:45.632 --> 07:47.134
Oh, no!

07:47.259 --> 07:48.927
No, no!
What's wrong?

07:49.052 --> 07:50.262
(laughs)

07:50.387 --> 07:51.930
Uh, we overslept. I'm-I'm late.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.514
We got to go.
Please, get up.

07:59.229 --> 08:01.022
Good morning, Skank.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.899
Get a life, Naomi.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.901
Hey, do you, uh...

08:05.026 --> 08:06.527
You want to
hang out later?

08:06.653 --> 08:08.863
Maybe. I'll let you know.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.865
Yo, Annie, I got
a mouse pad made

08:10.991 --> 08:12.326
with the image
from your sext.

08:12.451 --> 08:14.619
Closest you'll ever get
to a girl.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.704
SILVER:
First of all,
I want to say

08:16.830 --> 08:18.706
how sorry I am
for your loss.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.125
MAN:
Thanks.

08:20.250 --> 08:23.586
So, how did you find out
about what had happened to him?

08:23.711 --> 08:25.546
What's going on?
You know
that homeless guy

08:25.672 --> 08:27.007
that was killed
in the hit-and-run?

08:27.132 --> 08:28.216
His name is
Joe Herman.

08:28.342 --> 08:29.801
Apparently,
he went here,

08:29.926 --> 08:32.679
and he donated, like, $100,000
to West Bev in his will.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.054
What?!
I know. Crazy, right?

08:34.181 --> 08:35.097
Check this out for crazy.

08:35.222 --> 08:36.265
His nephew goes here.

08:36.390 --> 08:37.976
That's him.

08:38.101 --> 08:40.561
SILVER:
His death must have
been such a shock, huh?

08:40.687 --> 08:41.855
Yeah.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.606
Yeah, it was.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.466
I don't mean to pry.
I just think that the students

09:09.590 --> 09:11.092
of West Beverly would like
to know

09:11.218 --> 09:12.635
about their mysterious
benefactor.

09:12.760 --> 09:13.845
Oh, they do, huh?

09:13.970 --> 09:15.430
Lucky me.

09:15.555 --> 09:18.225
This must be
what it's like to be popular.

09:18.350 --> 09:20.935
Can you tell us anything else
about your uncle?

09:21.061 --> 09:22.854
He was nuts.

09:22.979 --> 09:24.481
Schizo.

09:24.647 --> 09:27.817
Um, he was...
he was mentally ill?

09:27.942 --> 09:29.986
Whatever you want to call it.

09:30.111 --> 09:31.238
Wait a minute.

09:31.363 --> 09:33.656
You're that
crazy chick.

09:33.781 --> 09:35.783
Uh, mentally ill chick.

09:35.909 --> 09:39.454
Seriously, I loved that
movie you made last year.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.831
It was like a mix
between early Cocteau

09:41.956 --> 09:46.127
meets, uh, Un Chien Andalou
meets something wack.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.505
Uh, back to your uncle.

09:48.629 --> 09:50.882
Why do you think he left
all his money to our school?

09:51.007 --> 09:53.301
Beats me.

09:53.427 --> 09:56.012
Are there any leads
in this case?

09:56.137 --> 09:57.931
(scoffs)
Please.

09:58.056 --> 10:00.350
To the cops, he was just
another homeless guy

10:00.475 --> 10:03.437
left behind
like a piece of garbage.

10:03.562 --> 10:07.274
The person who hit him
and left him behind

10:07.399 --> 10:10.151
on the side of the road
was the piece of garbage.

10:15.574 --> 10:17.200
Hey, Millicent, great
goal against Fairfax.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.993
Sweeper never even
saw it coming.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.995
Good job.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.290
Hey, Gavin, I told you,
no skates at school!

10:23.415 --> 10:24.207
You said no rollerblading.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.293
No, I said no rolling

10:26.418 --> 10:28.169
wheels that attach
to your feet.

10:30.922 --> 10:31.881
Hey, Navid?

10:32.006 --> 10:33.800
Principal Wilson!

10:33.925 --> 10:34.968
Hey!

10:35.093 --> 10:36.886
How you doing?
Eh.

10:37.011 --> 10:39.013
Hey, how about
that homeless guy?

10:39.139 --> 10:41.224
$100,000 for the school!

10:41.349 --> 10:43.810
That's a pretty amazing story.

10:43.935 --> 10:45.728
Uh, the Blaze is all over that,

10:45.853 --> 10:47.730
just so you know,
so don't you worry.

10:47.855 --> 10:49.399
I'm gonna, uh,
report the heck out of it.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.318
Okay?

10:51.443 --> 10:52.693
Hey, so,
where's Dixon?

10:52.819 --> 10:54.112
I haven't seen
him all morning.

10:54.237 --> 10:55.238
Everything okay?

10:55.363 --> 10:57.532
He's, uh...

10:59.951 --> 11:02.203
Well, the thing is, he's...

11:02.329 --> 11:05.499
DIXON:
Hey! What's up, Dad?

11:05.624 --> 11:07.750
Navid, where the heck
have you been, man?

11:07.875 --> 11:09.503
I've been looking
all over for you.

11:09.628 --> 11:13.047
We got to polish up that
tsetse fly presentation, man.
Yeah.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.757
That'd be great.
Yeah.

11:14.882 --> 11:17.177
So, uh, we're going
to get going.

11:17.302 --> 11:18.219
See you later, Pops.
Later.
Yeah.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.305
(chuckles)
Ah, man.

11:20.430 --> 11:21.389
I'm covered
with hives, bro.

11:21.515 --> 11:22.890
Thanks, man. Thanks.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.892
(Teddy clears throat)

11:25.018 --> 11:26.353
Hey!

11:26.478 --> 11:27.979
Um, hey.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.814
Do you want to go grab
some lunch or something?

11:29.939 --> 11:31.983
Uh... I-I, I can't.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.109
I have abs.

11:33.234 --> 11:34.444
Um, I mean, lab.

11:34.569 --> 11:37.322
I got...
I got chemistry lab.

11:37.447 --> 11:40.158
So, um... yeah, I'm late.

11:40.283 --> 11:42.285
Bye.
Bye.

11:43.286 --> 11:44.371
Ugh...

11:45.413 --> 11:47.290
Oh, my God!

11:47.415 --> 11:49.083
We've got to go
to the "Ark de Triumph."

11:49.209 --> 11:50.751
(laughs)

11:50.877 --> 11:52.379
L'Arc De Triomphe.

11:52.504 --> 11:55.048
You are so adorable.

11:55.173 --> 11:56.550
(chuckles)

11:56.675 --> 11:58.552
You are wonderful.
Yeah, well.

11:58.677 --> 12:00.178
I can't believe
you're taking me to Paris!

12:00.303 --> 12:01.846
I've never been
out of the country.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.931
Yeah, you have.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.266
Dad took you to Canada.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.852
Yeah, well, well...

12:07.977 --> 12:10.146
Montreal's no Paris.

12:10.271 --> 12:12.190
Just saying, you said
you'd never been out
of the country,

12:12.315 --> 12:13.816
and you have.

12:13.941 --> 12:16.944
Hey, Liam.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.947
How about you don't use
that tone with your mother?

12:20.073 --> 12:21.074
Okay?

12:23.660 --> 12:26.079
Hey.
Would you look at this?

12:26.204 --> 12:27.622
We know her, don't we?

12:29.624 --> 12:31.626
Yeah.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.255
Yeah, we do.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.424
I can't believe people would
rather read this

12:37.549 --> 12:39.008
than watch the Blaze.
I mean, really?

12:39.133 --> 12:41.511
This is an insult
to student intelligence.

12:41.636 --> 12:44.556
Yeah. Sasha and I both
hate celebrity news.

12:44.681 --> 12:47.766
I mean, it's like we're both
so in tune, kid.

12:47.892 --> 12:50.895
Ah... you guys are
like Siamese twins, huh?

12:51.020 --> 12:52.272
(mocking laugh)

12:52.397 --> 12:54.941
Did I tell you guys that we both
like DJ/rupture?

12:55.066 --> 12:56.943
Yeah, and Roy Campanella.
And orange sherbert.

12:57.068 --> 12:58.111
And Casablanca.

12:58.236 --> 13:00.405
All right, all right!

13:00.530 --> 13:03.283
Geez. It's just that
I've never found anybody

13:03.408 --> 13:05.368
who gets me like
she does, you know?

13:05.493 --> 13:07.412
It's like she knows me, man.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.456
Right, she knows you.

13:09.581 --> 13:10.957
Except for the little fact

13:11.082 --> 13:12.292
that you are a junior
in high school.

13:12.417 --> 13:13.627
Little fact.

13:13.752 --> 13:15.462
Yeah, I'm going
to tell her, guys.

13:15.587 --> 13:17.297
You could invite her
to junior prom.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.340
Tell her there.
Yeah.
Shut up.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.509
Both of you, all right?
I'm going to tell her.
I'm going to do it.

13:21.635 --> 13:23.303
Just when the time's right.

13:33.688 --> 13:35.898
LIAM:
Beautiful night, isn't it?

13:37.525 --> 13:38.568
What are you doing here?

13:38.693 --> 13:40.153
We need to talk.

13:40.278 --> 13:41.655
In private.

13:41.780 --> 13:43.657
(laughs)
Should I leave
you alone or...

13:43.782 --> 13:45.659
You know what? It doesn't have
to be in private.

13:45.784 --> 13:48.411
I don't mind
discussing Olivier

13:48.536 --> 13:50.121
in front of your date.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.331
(chuckles)

13:51.456 --> 13:53.291
Darling, go inside.

13:53.416 --> 13:55.585
I'll be right in.

13:55.710 --> 13:56.919
Okay.
Okay.

13:59.714 --> 14:01.716
What are you talking about?

14:09.056 --> 14:11.225
(gasps):
How did you...?

14:11.351 --> 14:12.644
Oh, finding
the picture was luck.

14:12.769 --> 14:14.895
Then I got on
the Internet.

14:15.021 --> 14:17.315
A lot comes up, it turns out.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.526
Partied pretty
hard, huh?

14:19.651 --> 14:21.611
Chased after a lot
of guys with money

14:21.736 --> 14:24.531
and titles.
You don't know anything.

14:24.656 --> 14:27.241
And then,
you landed Olivier.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.537
Rich, a baron.

14:30.662 --> 14:33.540
Perfect fairy tale
for a gold digger.

14:33.665 --> 14:36.417
I mean, "happily
ever after," right?

14:36.543 --> 14:38.712
Until your marriage
ended after one month.

14:38.837 --> 14:40.213
According
to the French tabloids,

14:40.338 --> 14:43.216
you are such a spendaholic that,
when you guys split up,

14:43.341 --> 14:44.551
you were broke.

14:44.676 --> 14:46.219
You know what's funny?

14:46.344 --> 14:48.262
Naomi never told me
you were married.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.473
Or broke.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.350
Or does she not know?

14:52.475 --> 14:53.727
Because...

14:53.852 --> 14:55.353
I thought your whole
relationship

14:55.478 --> 14:56.354
was based on trust.

14:56.479 --> 14:58.481
What do you want?

14:58.606 --> 15:00.441
I want you to tell her
what happened on prom night.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.277
Fine.

15:04.487 --> 15:06.489
Give me 24 hours.

15:06.614 --> 15:07.615
Fine.

15:16.875 --> 15:19.001
Man, agents are scum.
Trying to blackmail you
into auditioning.

15:19.126 --> 15:22.714
Yeah, but if I just
go on this one audition,

15:22.839 --> 15:25.258
all I miss this afternoon
is Humanities.
Wait, I don't get it.

15:25.383 --> 15:27.218
I thought you didn't want
to do the acting thing anymore.

15:27.343 --> 15:29.387
No, it's not that
I don't want to,

15:29.512 --> 15:32.348
it's just... ugh...

15:32.473 --> 15:34.684
I just think
it's probably a good
idea to take a break.

15:34.809 --> 15:36.519
Huh. Agreed.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.605
But I don't want my
agent to drop me.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.981
I mean, acting
is my passion.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.817
I'm going to go back
to it eventually.

15:44.694 --> 15:45.986
Oh, yeah, and then
when you're ready,

15:46.112 --> 15:47.154
you'll get a new agent.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.615
(laughing)

15:48.740 --> 15:50.617
Uh, I'm sorry, no offense.

15:50.742 --> 15:52.452
You, you don't know what
you're talking about.

15:52.577 --> 15:53.661
That's not how
things work.
Why not?

15:53.787 --> 15:55.747
You're pretty amazing.

15:55.872 --> 15:59.667
Um... baby, I am
a green-eyed brunette

15:59.793 --> 16:01.461
who can cry on command.
Hmm.

16:01.586 --> 16:04.589
Do you know how many other
girls there are just like me?
Yeah.

16:04.714 --> 16:06.299
I do.

16:06.424 --> 16:08.217
Zero.

16:08.342 --> 16:09.594
(laughs)
Don't do it. Don't go.

16:09.719 --> 16:12.179
No, I'm serious.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.014
You know how that
world makes you.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.767
All that Hollywood insanity,

16:15.892 --> 16:17.435
it just chews people up
and spits them out.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.061
Look at you.

16:19.186 --> 16:20.521
Look what happened
to you last year:

16:20.647 --> 16:22.148
all the drugs,
the pregnancy...

16:22.273 --> 16:24.191
No, I know, I was there.
I remember.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.819
You're doing it, you know?

16:25.944 --> 16:27.695
And you even
reached that title

16:27.821 --> 16:30.072
of, uh, "No Drama Adrianna."

16:30.197 --> 16:31.198
Hey, you two.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.450
Hey.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.537
You guys ever take a class
with Mr. Lichtenstein?

16:36.663 --> 16:39.039
TEDDY: The guy's like
a freakin' terrorist.

16:39.165 --> 16:40.207
Dude, you're taking
him before lunch?

16:40.333 --> 16:42.126
Yeah.
Once his blood
sugar drops,

16:42.251 --> 16:45.087
you're done-zo.
Dude, unreal.

16:45.212 --> 16:47.507
You mind if
I grab a few fries?

16:47.632 --> 16:49.342
Yeah.
All right.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.469
Feel free.

16:51.594 --> 16:53.429
Um, I got to go,

16:53.554 --> 16:55.431
uh, make a call to my agent.

16:55.556 --> 16:56.766
Yeah?
Yeah.

16:56.891 --> 16:59.143
Cool.
But I will
see you later?

16:59.268 --> 17:00.227
Okay. Bye, babe.
Mm-hmm.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.479
Bye.

17:19.789 --> 17:21.332
Hey.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.334
Hey.

17:23.459 --> 17:27.588
I-I just wanted
to say that, um...

17:27.714 --> 17:29.340
I'm really sorry
about your uncle.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.425
Okay.

17:33.427 --> 17:34.470
Thanks.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.057
I'm just so sorry.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.101
Why?

17:41.227 --> 17:42.478
Did you know him or something?

17:42.603 --> 17:44.689
Uh, no, um...

17:44.814 --> 17:46.774
No, it-it-it's sad,

17:46.900 --> 17:49.527
and, and I just wanted to tell
you that I'm sorry.

17:49.652 --> 17:51.111
That's all.

17:56.450 --> 17:58.703
Teddy!

17:58.828 --> 18:00.955
Vicky.
(chuckles)

18:01.080 --> 18:03.541
So, uh, hey, I'm working
on a piece for the Blaze

18:03.666 --> 18:05.585
about Joe Herman,
and I was really hoping

18:05.710 --> 18:07.461
to get a comment from you.

18:07.587 --> 18:10.297
I mean, after all,
you were the one who
discovered his body.

18:10.423 --> 18:11.632
Yeah, well, I was surprised.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.427
I mean, a hundred grand,
that's pretty generous.

18:14.552 --> 18:16.178
I thought he was
just a homeless guy.

18:16.303 --> 18:18.347
I'm sorry...

18:18.472 --> 18:19.640
"Just a homeless guy"?

18:19.766 --> 18:22.810
Okay, that didn't
come out right.

18:22.936 --> 18:27.023
I meant an... an
"abode-challenged
individual."

18:27.189 --> 18:28.441
Do you think
being homeless is funny?

18:28.566 --> 18:29.525
Don't you?

18:29.650 --> 18:31.151
Look, they live
in cardboard boxes,

18:31.277 --> 18:32.486
use grocery carts
as means of locomotion...

18:32.612 --> 18:34.363
(chuckles)

18:34.488 --> 18:37.700
I'm kidding. I'm kidding!

18:37.825 --> 18:39.660
Why don't you go down to
Venice Boulevard to do that set?

18:39.786 --> 18:41.537
I mean, maybe you
can start off with:

18:41.662 --> 18:43.330
"Hey, I'm Teddy.

18:43.456 --> 18:44.916
"My dad's a major movie star
and I'll never have

18:45.041 --> 18:46.667
to work a day in my life."
All right. All right, I get you.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.419
It was in bad taste.

18:48.544 --> 18:49.921
Whatever, um...

18:50.046 --> 18:51.297
Can you do
the interview, please?

18:51.422 --> 18:52.339
About Joe Herman?

18:52.465 --> 18:53.716
I...

18:53.841 --> 18:55.468
You know what? I can't.

18:55.593 --> 18:57.553
No, thanks.

18:57.678 --> 18:58.846
"No, thanks"?

18:58.972 --> 19:00.347
You got to leave me
out of it, okay?

19:00.473 --> 19:01.933
All right, look,
maybe you saw something

19:02.058 --> 19:03.684
that you don't think
is important...
Look!

19:03.810 --> 19:05.728
I can't do it, okay?

19:06.938 --> 19:08.648
Got it.

19:08.773 --> 19:09.899
You can joke
about the homeless,

19:10.024 --> 19:11.442
but you can't devote
a single second

19:11.567 --> 19:12.693
of your precious time

19:12.819 --> 19:14.528
for one of them
who was murdered.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.405
It's fabulous.

19:17.907 --> 19:19.199
Swinson.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.786
Tahmaseb.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.913
Tate-Duncan?

19:25.873 --> 19:26.958
Has anyone
seen Adrianna?

19:27.083 --> 19:28.417
Navid, do you
know where she is?

19:28.542 --> 19:30.252
Uh...

19:30.377 --> 19:32.546
I think she's
at a doctor's appointment.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.590
Okay.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.229
Hey.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.398
Sweetie...

19:51.524 --> 19:52.775
Come sit down
over here with me.

19:54.234 --> 19:56.403
There's something
we need to talk about.

20:03.369 --> 20:04.996
I have to tell you something.

20:05.121 --> 20:07.665
Something that's
going to upset you.

20:07.790 --> 20:09.542
What is it, Jen?
You're scaring me.

20:09.667 --> 20:13.295
The thing is, Naomi...

20:13.420 --> 20:14.630
I'm married.

20:14.755 --> 20:18.051
What?
Well, it was all
quite impulsive, really.

20:18.176 --> 20:21.679
We met last year and two months
later we were married.

20:21.804 --> 20:23.305
His name's Olivier.

20:23.430 --> 20:24.390
He's French.

20:24.515 --> 20:25.558
Why didn't you tell me?

20:25.683 --> 20:28.644
Because...

20:28.769 --> 20:32.982
Because right after we were
married, I walked in

20:33.107 --> 20:34.984
on Olivier in bed
with another woman.

20:35.109 --> 20:37.361
And I left him.
Oh, my God.

20:37.486 --> 20:38.946
There's more.

20:39.072 --> 20:40.656
What more?

20:40.781 --> 20:43.534
Well, when I told you

20:43.659 --> 20:46.412
my money was
"tied up" in Europe,

20:46.537 --> 20:49.790
that wasn't exactly true.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.418
The truth is that...

20:52.543 --> 20:55.588
I spent it all
before I met Olivier.

20:56.923 --> 20:59.008
And now I'm broke.

20:59.133 --> 21:02.095
I've been paying for everything:

21:02.220 --> 21:05.014
the rent, your clothes,
your car,

21:05.139 --> 21:06.766
your twice-weekly appointments

21:06.891 --> 21:08.684
at the Face Place.

21:08.809 --> 21:11.353
What were you planning to do,
live off me forever, Jen?

21:11.478 --> 21:12.939
No, of course not.

21:13.064 --> 21:14.774
And I have
every intention

21:14.899 --> 21:16.525
of paying you back.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.694
I just needed to get out
of Europe and clear my head

21:18.819 --> 21:19.987
and figure out what to do.

21:20.113 --> 21:22.115
There's only
one answer.

21:22.240 --> 21:24.784
I'm going back to Olivier.
What?

21:24.909 --> 21:27.703
I can't live off you anymore.

21:27.828 --> 21:28.829
I-I just can't.

21:28.955 --> 21:31.665
It won't be so bad.

21:31.791 --> 21:35.335
Olivier wants me back and...

21:35.461 --> 21:37.588
I think I can live
with an open marriage.

21:37.713 --> 21:40.549
"An open marriage"?!

21:40.674 --> 21:42.384
Jen!

21:42.509 --> 21:44.595
What, are you
out of your mind? No!

21:44.720 --> 21:46.013
I have too much
pride anyway.

21:46.139 --> 21:48.474
Maybe it'll be good for me,

21:48.599 --> 21:50.309
in some sort of spiritual sense.

21:51.894 --> 21:53.104
And plus, when I'm back
with Olivier,

21:53.229 --> 21:55.064
I-I will pay you back
right away.

21:55.189 --> 21:56.649
You'll have
your trust fund back.

21:56.774 --> 21:59.777
I'm not worried
about my stupid trust fund.

21:59.902 --> 22:02.488
I'm worried about you.

22:02.613 --> 22:03.572
Look, look at me.

22:03.697 --> 22:06.117
You.

22:06.242 --> 22:08.452
Okay, you're not going
back to some

22:08.577 --> 22:10.288
loveless marriage
with some loser who will

22:10.412 --> 22:11.622
cheat on you like
Dad did with Mom.

22:11.747 --> 22:13.249
No way in hell.

22:13.373 --> 22:15.417
Maybe if I just
go back with Olivier.

22:15.542 --> 22:16.627
Over my dead body.

22:16.752 --> 22:18.545
Stop it!

22:18.671 --> 22:20.798
I don't want to hear
another word about it.

22:26.679 --> 22:30.348
I didn't know Joe myself,
but I've had a chance now

22:30.474 --> 22:33.019
to talk to some of
his teachers and fellow students

22:33.144 --> 22:35.146
who knew him when
he was here at West Bev,

22:35.271 --> 22:38.607
and this is what
I've discovered.

22:38.732 --> 22:40.609
Joe loved earth science.

22:40.734 --> 22:44.780
He petitioned the school
to buy an electron microscope.

22:44.905 --> 22:49.618
His sophomore year, he played
varsity soccer for three years.

22:49.743 --> 22:53.539
Joe also participated
in two school plays.

22:53.664 --> 22:56.250
He was Artie
in The House of Blue Leaves,

22:56.374 --> 22:58.669
and he was the Narrator
in Our Town.

22:58.794 --> 23:02.715
Joe Herman was a West Bev
student, like all of you.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.466
Like I was.

23:04.591 --> 23:06.760
He was one of us.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.888
♪ ♪

23:15.936 --> 23:17.855
(engine revving)

23:19.899 --> 23:22.026
DIXON:
Look, I'm getting you
to Geoffrey's before sunset.

23:22.151 --> 23:23.736
I don't care how
many tickets I get.

23:23.861 --> 23:25.363
You hungry?

23:25.487 --> 23:27.573
No, I'm starving, and excited
about eating at Geoffrey's.

23:27.698 --> 23:28.991
(laughs)

23:29.116 --> 23:30.534
Yeah, there's nothing

23:30.659 --> 23:32.953
like a little herb-crusted
salmon by the sea.

23:33.079 --> 23:35.081
SASHA:
Yeah.

23:38.542 --> 23:41.670
You know, I gotta
tell you something, Dixon--

23:41.795 --> 23:44.924
I'm not really used to
this whole fancy cars,

23:45.049 --> 23:47.176
fancy dinners thing.

23:47.301 --> 23:51.180
Honestly, I have, like,
$100,000 in student loans;

23:51.305 --> 23:55.101
I-I have a roommate
and, most nights,

23:55.226 --> 23:57.144
when I'm not
with you, I...

23:57.270 --> 23:59.855
I eat ramen noodles.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.065
Sasha, it d...

24:01.190 --> 24:02.816
No, I know, I know, I know.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.568
I probably shouldn't
be telling you this,

24:04.693 --> 24:06.528
'cause L.A. is all
about appearances, but...

24:06.653 --> 24:08.948
I don't know, it's...

24:09.073 --> 24:10.908
When I'm with you, it's, like,

24:11.033 --> 24:12.743
I feel like I can be real.

24:12.868 --> 24:15.246
You know? I feel like
I can tell you anything.

24:16.997 --> 24:18.874
Hey, Sasha?

24:18.999 --> 24:20.626
Yeah?

24:22.878 --> 24:25.047
All right, what were you like
when you were younger?

24:25.172 --> 24:26.506
When I was younger?

24:26.632 --> 24:27.841
Yeah, like, um,

24:27.967 --> 24:29.509
high school.

24:29.635 --> 24:31.720
Oh, man, that was
a long time ago.

24:31.845 --> 24:34.848
Um, I guess like
every other high school kid.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.350
Dumb as dirt.

24:36.474 --> 24:38.727
Thought I knew everything,
really knew nothing.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.020
(laughs)

24:40.146 --> 24:42.064
(laughs)

24:42.189 --> 24:43.899
I mean, but, you know,

24:44.024 --> 24:47.069
there-there are some high school
kids that are mature, right?

24:47.194 --> 24:49.071
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure
they think they are.

24:49.196 --> 24:50.239
I mean, but, come on.

24:50.364 --> 24:52.158
How mature can they really be?

24:52.283 --> 24:53.242
They haven't
done anything.

24:53.367 --> 24:54.827
I mean, come on.

24:54.952 --> 24:57.121
Think about how different
you are since you graduated.

24:57.246 --> 24:59.248
Yeah, worlds away, right?

24:59.373 --> 25:01.000
Yeah, yeah, I-I guess
you're right.

25:01.125 --> 25:02.793
Mm.

25:02.918 --> 25:05.671
(sudden screech,
then thumping)

25:05.796 --> 25:09.175
And so, I said to Warren Beatty,
"Back off, man.

25:09.300 --> 25:10.968
I'm hitting on this girl."

25:11.093 --> 25:12.261
(laughter)
You did
not say that.

25:12.386 --> 25:14.596
Yes, I did.
WAITER: Hi, guys.

25:14.721 --> 25:16.140
Does anyone care for
an hors d'oeuvre?

25:16.265 --> 25:17.224
Oh, yeah, sure.
Awesome.

25:17.350 --> 25:18.642
These look great.

25:18.767 --> 25:19.935
These are
wonderful.

25:21.103 --> 25:22.146
Thanks, man.
Enjoy yourself.

25:22.271 --> 25:23.605
(sighs)
Wow.

25:23.730 --> 25:25.774
I can't believe
you talked to that guy.

25:25.899 --> 25:28.277
Don't you know
he's just a waiter?

25:28.402 --> 25:31.947
All right, look,
I was a jerk earlier.

25:33.491 --> 25:35.617
I told a few
jokes that were...

25:35.742 --> 25:37.828
Well, they were in bad
taste, and I'm sorry

25:37.953 --> 25:38.871
about it.

25:38.996 --> 25:39.872
Are we cool now?

25:39.997 --> 25:41.207
It depends.

25:41.332 --> 25:42.708
Will you do the interview?

25:42.833 --> 25:43.959
I can't.

25:44.084 --> 25:46.837
Right, because even though
you're sorry,

25:46.962 --> 25:48.797
you're still a huge snob

25:48.922 --> 25:51.217
with a huge ego who thinks
his time is too precious

25:51.342 --> 25:53.093
to spend, uh, five minutes

25:53.219 --> 25:55.471
talking about someone
who's just a homeless guy.

25:55.595 --> 25:57.639
That's not the reason.
Then why can't
you do it?

25:57.764 --> 25:59.016
Because I'm not
allowed to, okay?

25:59.141 --> 26:00.809
There's an ongoing

26:00.934 --> 26:03.270
investigation,
and I'm a part of it.

26:03.396 --> 26:05.647
I really screwed up
by talking to Navid before.

26:05.772 --> 26:08.234
I could've ruined
the entire investigation.

26:08.359 --> 26:11.820
I can talk to the police,
and that's it.

26:11.945 --> 26:13.030
But not to you.

26:13.155 --> 26:14.323
Because you know what?

26:14.448 --> 26:17.159
You're not a cop,
you're not a detective.

26:17.284 --> 26:18.618
You're just
a high school student.

26:22.956 --> 26:24.417
Awkward.

26:34.968 --> 26:37.012
So, you actually went
to your audition?

26:37.137 --> 26:39.265
Well, yeah.

26:39.390 --> 26:41.267
I wanted
to keep my options open.

26:41.392 --> 26:43.102
(laughs)

26:43.227 --> 26:44.811
What, are you
disappointed in me?

26:44.937 --> 26:46.355
No, I'm not going to deny
it-- I am disappointed.

26:46.480 --> 26:47.814
(groans)

26:47.940 --> 26:48.982
Don't you remember
all the things

26:49.108 --> 26:50.150
that we went
through last year?

26:50.276 --> 26:51.402
Okay, well,
believe it or not,

26:51.527 --> 26:52.861
I didn't do blow
in the bathroom.

26:52.986 --> 26:53.862
Ade, this isn't a joke.

26:53.987 --> 26:56.323
Okay, it's not a joke
to me, either.

26:56.449 --> 26:58.284
Just trying
to keep things light.

26:58.409 --> 27:00.035
Okay, it was one audition--

27:00.160 --> 27:02.162
one-- I just wish
you would understand

27:02.288 --> 27:04.706
what this means to me,
how acting makes me feel.

27:04.831 --> 27:06.041
Yeah, and I wish for once

27:06.166 --> 27:07.126
that you would
understand how you

27:07.251 --> 27:08.377
make me feel, okay?

27:08.502 --> 27:10.129
This involves me, too, right?

27:10.254 --> 27:11.922
I mean, your actions
have ramifications.

27:12.047 --> 27:13.090
I've been there
through everything.
Mm.

27:13.215 --> 27:14.216
Through the rehab,
the pregnancy,

27:14.341 --> 27:15.384
the giving up your...

27:15.509 --> 27:16.552
Okay, what are you
trying to do?

27:16.676 --> 27:17.719
Are you trying
to make me feel guilty?

27:17.844 --> 27:19.888
No, Ade, I'm just trying
to help you.

27:20.013 --> 27:21.265
Well, maybe
I don't need your help.

27:23.016 --> 27:23.934
(phone ringing)

27:24.059 --> 27:25.769
(sighs)

27:25.894 --> 27:27.854
Oh, I got to take this.

27:27.980 --> 27:30.274
Hello?

27:32.276 --> 27:34.903
Um, wow.

27:35.028 --> 27:36.863
Okay.

27:38.282 --> 27:40.284
Okay.

27:41.868 --> 27:42.911
Thank you.

27:43.036 --> 27:44.955
Yeah.

27:46.123 --> 27:48.125
Bye.

27:50.336 --> 27:53.839
Um, that was my agent.

27:53.964 --> 27:55.757
I got the part.

27:55.882 --> 27:57.801
Well, congratulations.

28:00.554 --> 28:02.097
Well, I'm glad
you came, Annie.

28:02.222 --> 28:03.932
Yeah, it was really sweet
of you.

28:04.057 --> 28:05.142
Mm.

28:05.267 --> 28:06.560
Oh, it's so sad.

28:06.684 --> 28:08.437
Huh? Poor man,
just lost his way;

28:08.562 --> 28:10.063
fell through the cracks.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.024
Yeah. Um, if you guys
don't need me for anything,

28:12.149 --> 28:13.108
I'm just gonna head home.

28:13.233 --> 28:14.401
I'm pretty exhausted.

28:14.527 --> 28:16.278
Yeah, honey, go ahead.
Yeah, we'll be home soon.

28:22.284 --> 28:23.994
Okay, Navid, um, look,

28:24.119 --> 28:26.205
if I use my AAA, they'll ask
to see my license, right?

28:26.330 --> 28:28.666
And there it'll be, me,
Dixon Wilson,

28:28.790 --> 28:30.334
17 years old,
driving your father's car.

28:30.459 --> 28:32.419
Change the tire.

28:32.545 --> 28:33.920
I don't know how
to change a tire on that.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.005
It's like a
freakin' spaceship.

28:35.130 --> 28:36.131
Look, Dixon, I don't have time

28:36.256 --> 28:37.341
to deal with this
right now, okay?

28:37.466 --> 28:38.925
Believe it or not,
I actually have my own life.

28:39.051 --> 28:41.345
Navid.
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.

28:41.470 --> 28:43.013
Nav...

28:43.138 --> 28:45.057
Hey, Dixon?

28:47.518 --> 28:49.019
Oh, baby, you don't got
to worry about that.

28:49.144 --> 28:50.563
I know how
to change a tire...
What the hell is this?

28:55.984 --> 28:57.027
Oh...

28:57.152 --> 28:59.405
Why do you have a trunk
full of porn?

29:02.324 --> 29:03.909
(gasps)
(irritated sigh)

29:07.621 --> 29:08.414
What kind of pervert are you?

29:08.539 --> 29:09.582
I'm-I'm... (groans)

29:09.707 --> 29:11.333
You have a trunk
full of porn!

29:11.458 --> 29:13.627
What were you going
to do, go home and
watch a hundred movies?

29:13.752 --> 29:15.212
Sasha, no!
Then why do you have it?

29:15.337 --> 29:16.380
(stammers, gasps)

29:16.505 --> 29:18.382
You're clearly a pervert.

29:18.507 --> 29:20.467
I'm not...
Who else
has all this?

29:20.593 --> 29:22.344
People who...
who are in the business.

29:22.469 --> 29:24.304
What?

29:24.430 --> 29:26.806
You're in the porn business?

29:28.100 --> 29:31.019
Um...

29:31.144 --> 29:32.979
Yeah.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.273
Oh!

29:34.398 --> 29:37.317
Yeah, yeah, I-I am.

29:37.443 --> 29:40.237
But not, not the
perverted part,

29:40.362 --> 29:43.282
more the money part,
which is why

29:43.407 --> 29:45.367
I have all of this.

29:47.620 --> 29:49.455
You said you were
in the music business.

29:49.580 --> 29:51.206
Well, yeah, yeah.

29:51.331 --> 29:53.250
I mean, I'm-I'm trying
to get into it.

29:53.375 --> 29:56.044
But porn is...
how I make my money.

29:56.169 --> 29:58.046
(groans)

29:58.171 --> 30:00.549
I-I'm trying to get out of it
because, obviously,

30:00.674 --> 30:03.051
I'm pretty ashamed to even
be associated with the industry.

30:04.844 --> 30:07.514
Look, I was really,
really embarrassed,

30:07.640 --> 30:10.350
but I shouldn't
have lied.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.228
So I'm really sorry.

30:14.563 --> 30:16.064
I feel like I don't
know even know you.

30:17.691 --> 30:18.900
What else have you lied about?

30:19.025 --> 30:21.069
Nothing.
Nothing, nothing else.

30:21.194 --> 30:23.363
I swear.

30:23.489 --> 30:25.865
Everything else
you know.

30:25.991 --> 30:27.576
You promise.

30:27.701 --> 30:28.952
No more lies?

30:29.077 --> 30:30.829
No more lies.

30:42.299 --> 30:46.553
Annie. Hey.

30:46.679 --> 30:48.722
I just wanted to say thanks

30:48.847 --> 30:50.307
for coming to my uncle's
memorial thing.

30:50.432 --> 30:51.891
That was really
cool of you.

30:52.017 --> 30:53.477
Yeah, sure.

30:53.602 --> 30:55.521
What are you up to now?

30:55.646 --> 30:57.564
Oh, I'm just headed home.

30:57.690 --> 30:59.441
I've got a bunch
of homework, so...

30:59.566 --> 31:00.442
(wry laugh)
Homework?

31:00.567 --> 31:02.902
The, uh, studious type?

31:05.071 --> 31:06.365
Look, blow it off.

31:06.490 --> 31:08.492
What?

31:08.617 --> 31:10.494
Blow off your homework.

31:10.619 --> 31:12.078
Come take a ride with me.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.164
I, I can't. I should go.

31:16.458 --> 31:18.335
That's all right.

31:18.460 --> 31:19.545
See you around?

31:19.670 --> 31:21.963
Okay. Bye.

31:25.967 --> 31:29.971
Uh, I guess I just...
needed to talk to someone.

31:30.096 --> 31:32.432
That's all.
What?

31:32.558 --> 31:34.184
About my uncle.

31:36.228 --> 31:39.105
It's finally, I think,
hitting me.

31:41.650 --> 31:42.901
He died, that he's gone.

31:45.153 --> 31:47.030
(sighs)

31:47.155 --> 31:49.241
I didn't know him
the past couple years,

31:49.366 --> 31:52.285
but when I was a kid...

31:52.411 --> 31:54.454
we, uh, used to hang out
all the time.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.790
I remember he
used to take me

31:56.915 --> 32:00.669
to the movies when I was, like,
two, on Sundays.

32:00.794 --> 32:03.129
Sometimes we'd see three,

32:03.255 --> 32:05.298
four, in a row.

32:05.424 --> 32:08.260
He must've liked something

32:08.385 --> 32:11.012
about the peace, you know,
of a dark theater,

32:11.137 --> 32:13.139
but for me, it was just...

32:13.265 --> 32:14.474
I lived for those days.

32:16.309 --> 32:19.187
I don't know, I guess
today just brought stuff up.

32:20.898 --> 32:23.316
But get on home.
Do your homework.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.318
I'll be fine.

32:25.444 --> 32:26.361
I'll see you.

32:26.486 --> 32:28.238
Jasper, wait.

32:28.363 --> 32:30.490
Um...

32:30.616 --> 32:32.576
I'll go for a ride with you.

32:32.701 --> 32:34.202
You will?

32:34.327 --> 32:36.204
Cool.

32:36.329 --> 32:37.539
Come on.

32:43.629 --> 32:45.631
Hey, have you seen Teddy?
Hi.

32:45.756 --> 32:47.466
I have to apologize to him.

32:47.591 --> 32:48.550
I haven't seen him.

32:48.675 --> 32:50.552
Everything okay, Navid?

32:50.677 --> 32:52.137
Yeah, everything's fine.

32:52.262 --> 32:53.179
Just fantastic.

32:58.811 --> 33:00.228
Did you tell Naomi
the truth?

33:00.353 --> 33:03.231
Yes, I did, actually.

33:05.275 --> 33:08.361
I told her that I'm married
and that I'm broke.

33:08.487 --> 33:10.656
I really want
to thank you,

33:10.781 --> 33:12.407
Liam, for forcing my hand.

33:12.532 --> 33:15.118
I feel so much better now
that Naomi knows everything.

33:15.243 --> 33:17.412
In fact, I feel
free as a bird.

33:17.537 --> 33:19.205
But, I mean...

33:19.331 --> 33:21.541
Oh, easy does it.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.502
Let me know if you're
going to have a fit

33:23.627 --> 33:26.505
so I can look for a broomstick
to put in your mouth.

33:26.630 --> 33:28.089
Now, why don't you
run along and

33:28.214 --> 33:30.425
look for some other
girl to obsess over?

33:30.550 --> 33:33.679
Naomi will never believe
that we slept together.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.238
(clears throat)

33:52.364 --> 33:53.406
Hey.

33:53.532 --> 33:56.618
Hey, you, you
all right?

33:56.743 --> 33:58.328
All right is relative,

33:58.453 --> 34:00.455
right?

34:05.544 --> 34:07.337
What's wrong?

34:07.462 --> 34:09.255
(sighs)

34:09.380 --> 34:10.422
Okay.

34:10.549 --> 34:11.675
(sniffling)

34:11.800 --> 34:14.260
So I went on that audition
I was telling you about.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.179
Yeah.

34:16.304 --> 34:19.181
I got the part.

34:19.306 --> 34:21.726
Ade, that's,
that's great.

34:21.851 --> 34:22.728
Is it?

34:22.853 --> 34:24.353
What's the problem?

34:24.478 --> 34:25.563
(groans)

34:25.688 --> 34:28.775
I don't know what I...

34:28.900 --> 34:30.985
I don't know
what I should do,

34:31.110 --> 34:34.406
you know, 'cause
I, I love acting.

34:34.531 --> 34:35.824
I love it.

34:35.949 --> 34:39.619
I know.
But maybe it is
bad for me.

34:39.745 --> 34:43.164
You know, I don't know if
I'm ready for that drama.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.085
What if I screw
everything up again?

34:48.670 --> 34:51.422
I'm scared.

34:51.547 --> 34:53.382
Come here.

34:53.507 --> 34:55.342
(crying)

34:55.467 --> 34:56.469
(sighs)

35:39.596 --> 35:43.725
(sighs)

35:43.850 --> 35:45.560
Um...

35:45.685 --> 35:46.895
(clears throat)

35:47.020 --> 35:48.396
We shouldn't
have done that.

35:48.521 --> 35:50.607
Um...

35:50.732 --> 35:52.317
I... I got to go.

35:52.442 --> 35:54.527
(stammers)

35:59.491 --> 36:01.451
You know, those
stars up there,

36:01.576 --> 36:03.703
they might not
even exist.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.914
I mean, it takes so long

36:06.039 --> 36:07.833
for the light
to travel here

36:07.958 --> 36:10.502
that the stars themselves,
they could be gone now.

36:10.627 --> 36:12.838
You know?

36:12.963 --> 36:15.048
It's just, it's just weird,

36:15.173 --> 36:17.425
but they're like a message
from back in time.

36:19.427 --> 36:23.932
Yeah. I-I'm not sure
I even know what that means.

36:24.057 --> 36:27.560
Just that, that...

36:27.686 --> 36:30.730
the universe is bigger than
we can imagine, you know?

36:30.856 --> 36:33.608
I guess it just kind of
puts things in perspective.

36:33.733 --> 36:36.695
All the stuff that we
think is so important,

36:36.820 --> 36:40.615
you know, in reality...
it's not.

36:40.740 --> 36:42.659
It's nothing.

36:42.784 --> 36:44.577
Man, I wish that was true.

36:44.703 --> 36:47.747
It is.

36:47.873 --> 36:51.417
Our planet, never
mind our species,

36:51.543 --> 36:53.294
you and me--
we're nothing.

36:53.419 --> 36:55.505
We're like a blip in time.

36:57.174 --> 36:59.258
You know, that's
what my uncle was.

37:01.761 --> 37:03.429
You know,
he was alive

37:03.555 --> 37:07.225
and now he's dead, but...

37:07.350 --> 37:11.270
Maybe it's not
that big of a deal, you know,

37:11.396 --> 37:12.939
in the scheme of the universe.

37:13.065 --> 37:15.316
Do you really think that's true?

37:15.441 --> 37:17.318
What will be will be, you know?

37:19.571 --> 37:21.656
We're just pawns in
the universe's game.

37:23.533 --> 37:24.951
We can't worry.

37:26.536 --> 37:30.456
We just have to lie back
and enjoy the ride.

37:30.582 --> 37:32.625
Yeah.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.772
174 Walden.

37:53.897 --> 37:55.398
It's a nice house.

37:55.523 --> 37:58.110
Yeah. Pretty traditional.

37:58.235 --> 38:00.862
I mean, not what you'd
expect from a porn king.

38:00.987 --> 38:03.615
He's not a "porn king."

38:03.740 --> 38:05.491
And I told you,
he's getting out of it.

38:05.617 --> 38:06.993
He just, he needed to make

38:07.119 --> 38:08.036
some money to pay
off some debt.

38:08.161 --> 38:09.871
But porn? I mean,

38:09.996 --> 38:11.497
that doesn't
bother you at all?

38:11.623 --> 38:13.541
I swear, if it
were any other guy

38:13.666 --> 38:16.419
then, yeah, it probably
would be a deal-breaker.

38:16.544 --> 38:19.505
But Dixon is special.

38:19.631 --> 38:22.467
He's sweet and
understanding

38:22.592 --> 38:25.011
and, oh, we have
so much in common.

38:25.137 --> 38:27.513
Oh, yes,
the orange sherbert

38:27.639 --> 38:29.057
and Roy Campanella

38:29.182 --> 38:31.059
and you even have
the same cell phone,

38:31.184 --> 38:32.811
which is why you
mixed them up.

38:32.936 --> 38:34.312
How adorable.

38:44.156 --> 38:46.532
I thought Dixon
drove a Lamborghini.

38:46.658 --> 38:50.578
Well, he probably just
has a few different cars.

38:54.082 --> 38:56.375
Who...?
Uh...

38:56.501 --> 38:57.710
Who is that
white woman

38:57.836 --> 39:01.339
and why is she hugging
your boyfriend?

39:08.680 --> 39:10.807
Um, thanks for coming over.

39:10.932 --> 39:12.600
Yeah.

39:12.725 --> 39:13.768
I wanted to tell you
this in person.

39:13.893 --> 39:15.394
Tell me what?

39:15.520 --> 39:17.981
Um...

39:18.106 --> 39:19.565
I turned down the part.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.400
And my agent's

39:21.526 --> 39:23.695
dropping me, but it's fine.

39:23.820 --> 39:25.905
You know, I'm totally,

39:26.031 --> 39:27.782
I'm totally taking the year off.

39:30.202 --> 39:32.578
We have been through so much.

39:32.704 --> 39:37.125
I just, I don't want any more
temptations right now.

39:41.546 --> 39:44.132
I love you so much, Ade.

39:45.175 --> 39:49.428
I am so in love with you.

39:52.807 --> 39:55.643
Um...

39:55.768 --> 39:58.563
So, my mom is
working late tonight.

39:58.688 --> 40:01.107
We have the whole place
to ourselves.

40:04.569 --> 40:05.820
I think we've waited
long enough,

40:05.945 --> 40:08.114
don't you think?

40:09.824 --> 40:11.034
For...?

40:11.159 --> 40:12.994
Yeah.

40:13.119 --> 40:14.746
Yeah.

40:14.871 --> 40:16.455
Yeah, uh-huh.

40:19.209 --> 40:21.669
(both moaning)

40:39.645 --> 40:41.022
(pops)

40:43.191 --> 40:45.360
Champagne for no reason.

40:45.484 --> 40:47.820
Now, this is the kind of life
I always thought I'd live.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.864
Mm, who says that
there's no reason?

40:49.989 --> 40:51.616
It's a Tuesday.

40:51.741 --> 40:53.034
Oh, yes.

40:53.159 --> 40:55.703
Uh, Champagne Tuesday
at the Clark residence.

40:55.828 --> 40:56.871
So, how was your day?

40:56.996 --> 40:59.916
Ugh, hideous.

41:00.041 --> 41:03.169
High school kids
are so annoying.

41:03.295 --> 41:04.837
Naomi driving you
up a wall?

41:07.257 --> 41:09.259
Something like that, yeah.

41:19.936 --> 41:23.773
JEN: Naomi will never
believe that we slept together.
