[Adam] Previously on
What About Brian:

00:01.959 --> 00:05.792
Life is short.
We should live it while we can.

00:05.792 --> 00:08.166
You're thinking about
getting a divorce?

00:08.166 --> 00:09.583
Yes.

00:09.583 --> 00:12.333
- You hear from the guys at KC?
- They called this morning.

00:12.333 --> 00:16.000
- Do they wanna buy the game?
- No, they don't wanna
buy the game.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.750
They did offer me a job.

00:19.625 --> 00:21.625
And I took it.

00:21.625 --> 00:23.959
I really think
this is the best move
for you right now.

00:23.959 --> 00:26.792
I need a job and the money.
I appreciate what
you're offering.

00:26.792 --> 00:28.333
That's why I took you
up on it.

00:28.333 --> 00:30.417
I'm glad you
changed your mind.

00:30.417 --> 00:32.375
- Want a lap dance?
- Yes, please.

00:32.375 --> 00:33.959
My real name.
It's Heather.

00:33.959 --> 00:36.792
So you never went, right?
To that Cuban place?

00:36.792 --> 00:38.583
Maybe sometime we could go.

00:38.583 --> 00:40.166
[Nicole]
Angelo was a big kid

00:40.166 --> 00:44.000
who loved soccer
and cartoons...

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
...and me.

00:49.667 --> 00:52.834
[Adam] Your mother
was a stripper?
You're kidding, right?

00:52.834 --> 00:54.542
Your mother?

00:54.542 --> 00:58.291
No. I basically grew up
in the back of a strip club.

00:58.291 --> 01:01.041
- Wow.
- And she taught me
all my best moves.

01:01.041 --> 01:02.583
[Adam laughs]

01:02.583 --> 01:05.166
And what was her
stripper name? Spring?

01:05.166 --> 01:09.458
Cute. No, actually,
she just went with
her middle name. Donna.

01:09.458 --> 01:12.417
- Well, that's not
very strippery.
- Well, what can I say?

01:12.417 --> 01:14.166
- She wasn't very creative.
- Mmm.

01:15.542 --> 01:18.208
I haven't done this
in a long time.

01:18.208 --> 01:22.709
Stay up all night.
Since... high school,
I think.

01:22.709 --> 01:24.458
You know, just talking.

01:25.583 --> 01:27.709
Nothing else.

01:27.709 --> 01:29.583
Well, that's
one of my rules.

01:29.583 --> 01:31.542
You come with rules?

01:31.542 --> 01:34.834
- No sex until the fifth date.
- And what date is this?

01:34.834 --> 01:37.083
- Two.
- Really? That's all?

01:37.083 --> 01:39.792
- Sorry.
- Well, why number five?

01:39.792 --> 01:42.083
That seems kind of random.

01:42.083 --> 01:44.709
- I never have sex
on a first date.
- Hmm.

01:44.709 --> 01:48.792
Date number two:
Since no one acts like their
real selves on a first date,

01:48.792 --> 01:51.417
the second date is kind of
like another first date.

01:51.417 --> 01:56.542
Date number three: Everyone
expects the third date
to be the sex date,

01:56.542 --> 02:00.375
so I like to make a guy
prove he'll go one more.

02:00.375 --> 02:04.667
- And why not
date number four?
- [Heather laughs]

02:04.667 --> 02:08.917
No real reason.
Except that five is
kind of my lucky number.

02:08.917 --> 02:10.750
- Oh?
- [Heather giggles]

02:12.792 --> 02:16.083
- Well, it seems that you...
- Mm-hmm.

02:17.542 --> 02:20.083
Sounds like you put
a lot of thought into this.

02:20.083 --> 02:21.875
You're gonna be late
for work.

02:21.875 --> 02:23.834
Are you worried
I'm gonna get fired?

02:23.834 --> 02:26.291
You can always tell them
you stayed up all night

02:26.291 --> 02:28.417
not having sex
with a stripper.

02:36.417 --> 02:40.917
Who leaves a magazine out
for expectant parents
called Dream Vacations?

02:40.917 --> 02:44.709
"Here's something
you won't be experiencing
for the next fifteen years,

02:44.709 --> 02:46.375
but, hey,
enjoy the pictures."

02:50.041 --> 02:54.041
OK, you need to relax.
It's just a job.

02:54.041 --> 02:57.125
- What are you so nervous about?
- It's gonna be a disaster.

02:57.125 --> 03:00.333
Maybe it'll just bring you
and Dad closer together.

03:00.333 --> 03:03.417
Are you high?
I spent my whole life
listening to him tell me

03:03.417 --> 03:05.500
how and why I'm doing
everything wrong.

03:05.500 --> 03:08.125
He's condescending,
arrogant, and likes to yell.

03:08.125 --> 03:11.458
- And I'm gonna work for him.
- Why did you take
this job anyway?

03:11.458 --> 03:13.291
Because I'm an idiot
and in debt.

03:13.291 --> 03:15.917
I need to make some
serious cash, like, yesterday.

03:15.917 --> 03:18.291
Unfortunately, this is
the best offer I have.

03:18.291 --> 03:20.959
- By far.
- Want to know what I think?

03:20.959 --> 03:23.625
- Nope.
- I think you want
his approval.

03:23.625 --> 03:27.458
- It's a classic
father-son dynamic.
- Well, thank you, Cat Stevens.

03:27.458 --> 03:30.542
Whatever. It seems like
it bothers you
more than it should.

03:30.542 --> 03:32.542
[exhales deeply]

03:33.792 --> 03:36.166
The truth is,
part of me feels

03:36.166 --> 03:38.333
like I'm betraying Mom
by working with him.

03:38.333 --> 03:39.458
She'd hate this.

03:39.458 --> 03:42.000
- [door opens]
- [footsteps]

03:42.000 --> 03:45.458
Sorry to make you wait.
It's been crazy here
this morning.

03:45.458 --> 03:48.458
How have you been feeling?
You been staying
off your feet?

03:48.458 --> 03:52.000
I've been disgustingly inactive.
I have zero contractions.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.834
- Can I please get back
to my life now?
- Not yet.

03:54.834 --> 03:58.375
Your tests show that
you're still at a high
risk for pre-term labor.

03:58.375 --> 03:59.750
Oh.

03:59.750 --> 04:02.458
Nicole, losing a spouse
is a traumatic event,

04:02.458 --> 04:05.375
both mentally
and physically.

04:05.375 --> 04:08.750
And stress
is very unhealthy
when you're pregnant.

04:08.750 --> 04:11.750
There's
a grief counseling group
I'd like you to attend.

04:11.750 --> 04:15.208
Well, I mean, I deal
with things on my own.

04:15.208 --> 04:18.834
I can't just get up in front
of all those people.
It's just weird.

04:18.834 --> 04:20.709
Those people
are there to help you.

04:20.709 --> 04:23.208
This is not a suggestion.
It's a prescription.

04:23.208 --> 04:25.375
You need to start
dealing with this now.

04:25.375 --> 04:27.917
For you and,
more importantly,
for your baby.

04:27.917 --> 04:30.125
I'll get you
some information.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.083
I cannot sit around and grieve
with a bunch of strangers.

04:39.083 --> 04:42.208
You wanna go work for Dad
instead? We can switch.

04:49.291 --> 04:52.500
- I see you got a real car.
- Actually, it's
Nicole's new one.

04:52.500 --> 04:55.208
I'm borrowing it
till I figure out
what I'm getting.

04:55.208 --> 04:56.417
Good idea.

04:56.417 --> 04:59.041
I always say a car
can't make a sale,

04:59.041 --> 05:00.750
but it definitely
can kill one.

05:00.750 --> 05:03.458
And I hate anything
that'll kill a sale.

05:03.458 --> 05:05.125
Having second thoughts?

05:07.083 --> 05:10.375
We should talk about
how this is gonna work
between you and me,

05:10.375 --> 05:12.709
seeing we don't have
the smoothest history.

05:12.709 --> 05:15.417
It's probably better
if we keep things business.

05:15.417 --> 05:17.458
Treat me like anyone else.

05:17.458 --> 05:20.250
I'm not expecting
any favors and I won't be
asking for any.

05:20.250 --> 05:21.917
I agree.

05:21.917 --> 05:24.375
- Morning, Mr. Davis.
- Dump the Danish, Bob.

05:24.375 --> 05:26.208
You can't stay lean
and focused

05:26.208 --> 05:28.834
if you're in a sugar coma
at eleven o'clock.

05:31.583 --> 05:34.834
Welcome to the company.
You can feel the energy,
can't you?

05:34.834 --> 05:36.750
I'm excited
to get started.

05:36.750 --> 05:39.959
I've decided to have you
shadow someone
for a couple of weeks.

05:39.959 --> 05:42.750
- Why?
- So you can see
how things are done.

05:42.750 --> 05:45.542
You wouldn't expect me
to hire a blind man

05:45.542 --> 05:48.875
and have him
get me a cup of coffee
the first day?

05:48.875 --> 05:51.458
You'll get a salary,
but no commissions yet.

05:51.458 --> 05:54.500
I don't need to shadow anyone.
We both know I can do this job.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.625
Commission's the main reason
I took it.

05:56.625 --> 05:58.792
- Just because I...
- Son. I'm the boss.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.792
It's business.
It's my business.

06:00.792 --> 06:04.667
And this is the way
I operate when anyone
starts here.

06:04.667 --> 06:06.792
So get used to it.

06:11.625 --> 06:15.375
Girls, I want your
shoes and coats on.
Daddy's gonna be here...

06:15.375 --> 06:17.375
- Any second.
- When'd you get here?

06:17.375 --> 06:19.875
- Daddy!
- Hey! What's up,
my beautiful girl?

06:19.875 --> 06:22.709
Good to see you.
Give me a hug.
Two minutes ago.

06:22.709 --> 06:25.667
Get your coats on in time
for school. Where's Carrie?

06:25.667 --> 06:29.792
She didn't have a good night
last night, so Maria's
putting her down for a nap.

06:29.792 --> 06:33.000
- Oh, I cleaned the sheets.
- You didn't have to do that.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.291
Well, you're here with
the girls for three days.

06:36.291 --> 06:38.875
The least I could do
is give you some clean sheets.

06:38.875 --> 06:40.375
Well, thanks.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.834
Is this
really gonna work?

06:45.834 --> 06:49.834
I mean, do separated people
actually switch off living
in their own house?

06:49.834 --> 06:52.250
- Are we crazy?
- We're gonna be fine.

06:52.250 --> 06:54.709
You know why?
Because it's not
about you and me.

06:54.709 --> 06:57.500
The most important thing
are the girls.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.041
Keeping their lives stable
is all that matters.

07:00.041 --> 07:01.250
OK.

07:01.250 --> 07:04.000
Mommy has a sleepover
with Aunt Nic this weekend.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.542
She sure does.

07:05.542 --> 07:09.375
She's going to Aunt Nic's
and she's gonna get crazy.

07:09.375 --> 07:12.291
Come on. Let's go.

07:12.291 --> 07:15.792
Why are you dressed up?
I thought you didn't
start work till Monday.

07:15.792 --> 07:18.625
They called and said
that it was gonna be
a crazy week,

07:18.625 --> 07:20.750
so they wanted me
to jump in.

07:20.750 --> 07:22.917
I'm excited. I think
it's gonna be great.

07:22.917 --> 07:25.375
- I'm glad you're
looking forward to it.
- Yeah.

07:25.375 --> 07:29.959
If you don't have time
to do the switch-off thing,
we can do it later.

07:29.959 --> 07:33.375
- I can stay with
the girls this weekend.
- We need to be consistent.

07:33.375 --> 07:37.375
We told them this is
what we were gonna do,
we gotta do it, right?

07:37.375 --> 07:39.959
- You're right. OK.
- All right?

07:39.959 --> 07:42.041
- Yeah.
- Girls, give Mommy
a kiss now.

07:42.041 --> 07:44.417
- Bye, my baby.
- Bye, Mommy.

07:44.417 --> 07:46.917
Bye-bye. Bye.
I love you guys.

07:46.917 --> 07:48.709
- We love you.
- Have fun, OK?

07:48.709 --> 07:51.500
- OK, OK. Let's go.
We're gonna be late.
- OK.

07:57.333 --> 07:59.917
You always said
you could use
a little Mommy time.

07:59.917 --> 08:02.250
Think of this
as a three-day vacation.

08:02.250 --> 08:04.417
What are you gonna do?

08:04.417 --> 08:09.375
I don't know. Everything
I can, I guess, you know.
I'm excited, sure.

08:09.375 --> 08:11.750
I just, uh...

08:11.750 --> 08:14.041
I feel guilty
leaving them.

08:14.041 --> 08:16.166
Everything's
gonna be fine.

08:16.166 --> 08:18.375
I'm not a complete nimrod.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.458
Well, just a little bit.

08:21.458 --> 08:24.125
- Enjoy it while you can, OK?
- I totally will.

08:24.125 --> 08:25.291
- Good.
- OK.

08:25.291 --> 08:26.583
OK.

08:27.792 --> 08:29.083
OK, girls. Come on.

11:11.792 --> 11:14.625
Are you kidding?
I couldn't turn it off.

11:14.625 --> 11:16.959
The missus wanted
to throttle me.

11:16.959 --> 11:18.125
[all laughing]

11:22.583 --> 11:24.959
This feels so good.

11:24.959 --> 11:27.959
How long did you say it was
since your last massage?

11:27.959 --> 11:30.417
What year is this?

11:30.417 --> 11:31.709

12:04.375 --> 12:06.417
- You think?
- Hell, yeah, man.

12:06.417 --> 12:09.667
The partners see you
working your ass off,
hosting parties,

12:09.667 --> 12:11.834
showing them things
are back in order.

12:11.834 --> 12:14.166
That's what they need
to make you one of them.

12:14.166 --> 12:16.834
Good, because this thing
is costing me a fortune.

12:16.834 --> 12:20.208
It's worth it. Trust me.
You just spend
whatever you gotta do.

12:20.208 --> 12:22.750
[woman] Adam, I have
Heather on line three.

12:22.750 --> 12:24.959
Yeah. Tell her
I'll call back.

12:26.166 --> 12:28.667
[Jimmy laughs]

12:28.667 --> 12:30.542
[clears throat] Um...

12:30.542 --> 12:33.000
- Who's Heather?
- No one. Someone.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
But, you know,
whatever.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.750
Nice. Get right back up
on that horse, baby.

12:38.750 --> 12:40.542
Giddy-up.

12:40.542 --> 12:43.959
- This Heather
coming to the party?
- I haven't thought about it.

12:43.959 --> 12:45.875
I don't know.
I don't think so.

12:45.875 --> 12:48.333
So when do I get
to meet her?
I gotta give my OK.

12:48.333 --> 12:52.000
Well, actually,
you've already met her.

12:53.917 --> 12:57.709
[sighs]
When her name was Summer.

13:01.542 --> 13:05.000
Get the hell out of here.
You've been hanging
with the stripper?

13:05.000 --> 13:06.875
- From your wedding night?
- Yeah.

13:06.875 --> 13:09.875
- Aw, man, that is just...
- Crazy, I know.

13:09.875 --> 13:11.709
No, I was gonna say
perfect.

13:11.709 --> 13:15.083
Look, the last thing
you need is a relationship.

13:15.083 --> 13:18.250
She's the perfect
rebound girl,
plus you've seen her naked,

13:18.250 --> 13:20.250
so you know
what you're getting into.

13:20.250 --> 13:23.250
And as I recall, it was,
uh... it was pretty good.

13:24.750 --> 13:27.417
How's the sex?
Off the charts, right?

13:27.417 --> 13:29.458
Come on. Show
a brother some love.

13:29.458 --> 13:32.250
- Incredible.
- Oh!

13:32.250 --> 13:37.083
Incredible. Well, now I know
why you're not bringing her
to the party.

13:37.083 --> 13:39.250
That would be, uh...

13:39.250 --> 13:41.583
- That'd be interesting.
- Yeah.

13:43.208 --> 13:46.000
Yeah. Interesting.

13:55.625 --> 13:58.291
I've had my eye
on this listing
for almost a year,

13:58.291 --> 14:00.583
so I'd appreciate it
if you'd just observe.

14:00.583 --> 14:01.792
Sure. It's your deal.

14:01.792 --> 14:04.291
Just a polite way of saying
keep your mouth shut.

14:04.291 --> 14:07.917
It's not "bring your kids
to work" day. I have
my real-estate license.

14:07.917 --> 14:11.917
I have my driver's license,
so I should be driving
the Indy 500 next year.

14:11.917 --> 14:13.500
Not the way you drive.

14:13.500 --> 14:17.542
You just let
the professional handle this.
Stand there and look cute.

14:19.959 --> 14:21.125
Is that milk?

14:23.458 --> 14:26.792
Maybe we should get you
a straw to go with
your latte next time.

14:28.792 --> 14:31.375
Guess this kind of is
"bring your kids
to work" day.

14:33.500 --> 14:37.959
- Right on time. Hello again.
- Mrs. Elizaldé, hi.
Nice to see you.

14:37.959 --> 14:39.917
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

14:39.917 --> 14:40.959
Watch and learn.

14:44.333 --> 14:48.375
That was great, Laura.
Wasn't it?

14:48.375 --> 14:51.291
Hi. We just started
a moment ago.
You're welcome to join.

14:52.417 --> 14:54.208
I wasn't looking for this.

14:55.500 --> 14:57.834
It was hard for me
the first time, too.

14:57.834 --> 15:00.166
I... Well, you know, I...

15:00.166 --> 15:03.083
This kind of thing
really isn't for me.

15:03.083 --> 15:08.375
You know, I...
I have friends...
that I can talk to.

15:08.375 --> 15:12.250
You're lucky.
You're lucky they understand.

15:17.875 --> 15:21.041
That's all nine of us
in this very room.

15:21.041 --> 15:23.542
My husband took this
before he passed.

15:23.542 --> 15:26.041
How do your kids feel
about your selling?

15:26.500 --> 15:27.875
[sighs]

15:27.875 --> 15:29.709
I can't say
they're very pleased,

15:29.709 --> 15:34.208
but they understand
that this is too much for me
to maintain alone at my age.

15:34.208 --> 15:38.500
- They want me to be happy.
- Of course. That makes sense.

15:38.500 --> 15:42.000
But it is going to be hard
to say goodbye to this home.

15:43.375 --> 15:45.709
This has been like
another child for me.

15:47.125 --> 15:49.542
So you get to see
your other kids again,

15:49.542 --> 15:50.875
but this is really goodbye.

15:54.333 --> 15:58.709
But you know what?
Sometimes saying goodbye
is the right thing to do.

15:58.709 --> 16:01.709
I left you for 90 seconds.
I told you keep
your mouth shut.

16:01.709 --> 16:03.792
Sorry I respect her
enough to make sure

16:03.792 --> 16:07.083
- she's making
the right decision.
- Who cares what you think?

16:07.083 --> 16:10.792
Sometimes, honesty
is not the best policy.

16:10.792 --> 16:14.417
Sometimes, the seller
needs help realizing
they want to sell.

16:14.417 --> 16:18.250
You'd convince her to get rid
of her house and not worry
about how she feels?

16:19.333 --> 16:20.709
I should kill your father

16:20.709 --> 16:23.417
for putting me on this
baby-sitting assignment.

16:23.417 --> 16:25.542
It hasn't been
a thrill for me, either.

16:25.542 --> 16:29.709
You got this job
because you blew your last one
and Daddy had to bail you out.

16:29.709 --> 16:31.959
What are you gonna do
when you blow this one?

16:32.875 --> 16:34.667
Could you please
open the door?

16:35.834 --> 16:37.834
Come on! Bridget!

16:42.000 --> 16:45.834
He told you everything?
Did he call here just
to complain about me?

16:45.834 --> 16:49.166
No, he's my father, too.
He called to check up on me.

16:49.166 --> 16:51.166
And I asked him
how his day was.

16:53.250 --> 16:55.792
- He's happy
you're there, Bri.
- Did he say that?

16:55.792 --> 16:58.333
- No, but he didn't
say he wasn't.
- You know what?

16:58.333 --> 17:01.250
Can we not talk
about Dad anymore?
Nine to five is enough.

17:03.792 --> 17:08.834
Thanks for getting the ham.
It's for a veal
saltimbocca I'm making.

17:08.834 --> 17:10.834
Angelo taught me to do it.

17:16.667 --> 17:19.875
For some reason,
I miss him so much more
when I'm cooking.

17:19.875 --> 17:24.375
- Did you go to that
meeting today?
- Well, sort of.

17:24.375 --> 17:28.959
I know I have to,
but... I have you,
I have friends.

17:28.959 --> 17:32.458
I can do the whole
exact process without
the stranger factor.

17:32.458 --> 17:34.500
Some people
don't even have that.

17:36.291 --> 17:38.291
How are you feeling?

17:39.041 --> 17:40.792
OK.

17:43.208 --> 17:47.000
I can't believe Dad
called to complain about me.
Why is he such an ass?

17:47.000 --> 17:50.667
Hey, you know,
I gotta get to Dave's.
But we'll talk later, OK?

17:52.792 --> 17:54.125
Bye.

17:55.166 --> 17:56.875
[door opens]

17:56.875 --> 17:58.875
- [Adam] Hello.
- Hello.

17:58.875 --> 18:01.500
I can't get the stupid
refrigerator door closed.

18:01.500 --> 18:04.625
Not exactly "how was
your day," but I'll take
what I can get.

18:09.208 --> 18:12.166
- What's in those boxes anyway?
- Oh, cheese and stuff.

18:12.166 --> 18:15.542
I'm having a work thing
here for a few people
tomorrow night.

18:15.542 --> 18:17.917
They must
really like cheese.

18:17.917 --> 18:19.250
Yeah.

18:21.875 --> 18:23.875
So, uh,
what should I wear?

18:26.375 --> 18:29.375
I'm kidding.
I'm not coming to your
work party. Stay calm.

18:35.583 --> 18:37.959
No, you should come.

18:37.959 --> 18:41.750
- Really, it's OK. I understand.
- No, I'm serious.
I mean, why not?

18:41.750 --> 18:44.417
Don't have to invite me
'cause I found your cheese.

18:44.417 --> 18:48.417
I'm not. I'm inviting you
because it'll be more fun
to have you here with me.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.083
- OK.
- Oh, wait a second.

18:53.875 --> 18:56.000
I just remembered.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.458
I don't invite girls
to work parties until
after the fifth date.

18:59.458 --> 19:01.834
- Shut up.
- Sorry.

19:09.250 --> 19:11.959
[man on TV]
Spending his money on...

19:11.959 --> 19:14.291
- It will be mapping...
- Thunderstorms...

19:14.291 --> 19:16.166
- Hollywood is abuzz...
- [Deena] Hey.

19:16.166 --> 19:17.750
Hi.

19:20.250 --> 19:22.750
How was your day?
Tell me everything.

19:22.750 --> 19:25.291
OK. Well, I got a massage.

19:25.291 --> 19:28.500
Then I went for a hike
and I ran some errands.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.250
Then I sat in a coffee shop

19:30.250 --> 19:33.166
and I read magazines
that I never have time
to read.

19:33.166 --> 19:35.667
That's a good one.

19:35.667 --> 19:39.041
Then a movie.
And then I went and
got frozen yogurt.

19:39.041 --> 19:41.792
- And I got some for you.
- Thanks.

19:41.792 --> 19:44.291
That was my day.
And my night.

19:44.291 --> 19:45.917
Sounds great.

19:48.917 --> 19:51.083
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

19:51.083 --> 19:53.333
I mean, it was...
it was great.

19:55.417 --> 19:58.500
But it's not like
I can just do it
all over again tomorrow.

19:58.500 --> 20:01.917
- Why not? I sure could.
- You're not missing
anything out there.

20:01.917 --> 20:06.583
- For me, it's just the work.
- Oh, my God. That's it. Ooh.

20:06.583 --> 20:10.000
I was driving home
and I started thinking,

20:10.000 --> 20:14.500
I have no idea what to do next,
I have nowhere to be tomorrow.

20:14.500 --> 20:17.625
And I gotta tell you,
I'm starting
to freak out, right?

20:17.625 --> 20:20.333
'Cause, I mean,
who am I, huh?

20:21.166 --> 20:22.667
What do I do?

20:22.667 --> 20:26.959
Do I have any skills
or even interests?

20:28.750 --> 20:31.834
It's like I cashed in
my entire personality,

20:31.834 --> 20:35.500
I mean, my being,
for my children,

20:35.500 --> 20:39.542
and now I'm just
this lump of flesh

20:39.542 --> 20:42.250
sitting on a stupid couch.

20:42.250 --> 20:46.542
Sorry. A really nice,
Italian leather couch,
obviously.

20:47.625 --> 20:49.625
You are a wonderful mother.

20:49.625 --> 20:53.125
I mean, can't that count
for who you are?

20:54.542 --> 20:57.333
Because they grow up
and they leave.

20:59.500 --> 21:01.625
Then what am I
gonna do, huh?

21:05.333 --> 21:08.083
I'm telling you,
I glimpsed my future
today and...

21:10.208 --> 21:12.542
[sighs] I don't know, hon.

21:17.417 --> 21:19.458
- What is this stuff?
- I don't know.

21:19.458 --> 21:22.291
They dropped it off
after we moved out
of the building.

21:22.291 --> 21:24.291
I think some of it's yours.

21:25.583 --> 21:28.333
I thought this was
gonna be so cool, 401(k),

21:28.333 --> 21:30.458
leaving the job
at the office,

21:30.458 --> 21:33.834
not being emotionally
attached to every decision.

21:33.834 --> 21:36.458
But I tell you, man,
it's an empty feeling.

21:36.458 --> 21:40.250
You know?
What the hell am I doing
in Berrytown, dude?

21:40.250 --> 21:43.208
You got mouths
to feed, a mortgage,
bills. It's life.

21:43.208 --> 21:46.083
Don't let the gobblers
get you down.

21:46.083 --> 21:49.875
- Who the hell even says that?
- This mug.

21:49.875 --> 21:51.792
I've been looking
all over for it.

21:51.792 --> 21:54.542
That's your
inspirational turkey mug.

21:56.166 --> 21:58.542
Too bad you didn't
have it today.

21:58.542 --> 22:02.208
My dad's got it in for me.
Doesn't matter if I blew
that house or not.

22:03.750 --> 22:05.417
Let me see that.

22:06.208 --> 22:08.208
You gotta be kidding me.

22:10.250 --> 22:13.709
What is that?
Notes from your
serial killer days?

22:13.709 --> 22:16.792
These are actually
the original sketches
for Throttle Autobahn.

22:18.542 --> 22:22.375
And now I'm drawing
the Berry Princesses.

22:22.375 --> 22:23.917
That's a hell
of a free fall.

22:23.917 --> 22:27.291
If their games are lame,
why don't you pitch them
some new stuff?

22:27.291 --> 22:30.542
You're surrounded
by corporate drones.
Don't have to be one.

22:30.542 --> 22:32.709
- [sighs]
- Go in and show 'em
what you got.

22:32.709 --> 22:34.375
Yeah, I should.

22:36.208 --> 22:39.166
Know what you should do?
You should go back
to that house.

22:39.166 --> 22:41.792
Tell that lady
you're gonna find her
a new one.

22:41.792 --> 22:46.125
Who said we have to get
kicked around just 'cause
we're not running the show?

22:46.125 --> 22:48.625
I mean, come on.
We'll be back on top.

22:48.625 --> 22:52.750
And until that day,
we should go kick some ass
and make some serious money.

22:52.750 --> 22:56.375
Yeah, hear, hear.
Starting tomorrow, no more
bitching or moaning.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.500
No more bitching
and moaning, man.
Just kicking ass.

22:59.500 --> 23:03.041
Greco and Davis style.
Bringing it
to the world, baby.

23:03.041 --> 23:04.875
Right. To tomorrow.

23:04.875 --> 23:06.667
Tomorrow.

23:06.667 --> 23:09.000
Greco. What up, my man?
How goes it?

23:09.000 --> 23:11.542
You got a minute?
Something I want
to run by you.

23:11.542 --> 23:15.375
- Great.
- What if we took
the Berrytown engine?

23:15.375 --> 23:17.583
But we replace
the hillside characters.

23:17.583 --> 23:20.000
We replace them
with zombies, right?

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
Then they need
some sort of fuel
to survive or something.

23:23.917 --> 23:25.166
What's the problem?

23:25.166 --> 23:27.041
You need to talk
to Barry Hanson

23:27.041 --> 23:29.875
over in Concept Designs.
He's your guy.

23:30.834 --> 23:33.083
Hanson.
Concept Designs. OK.

23:35.750 --> 23:37.709
- Brian Davis.
- Mrs. Elizaldé.

23:37.709 --> 23:39.542
I'm sorry to come by
unannounced.

23:39.542 --> 23:41.041
I was in the neighborhood.

23:41.041 --> 23:43.041
I wondered if you had
a couple of minutes.

23:43.041 --> 23:47.709
OK, so then let's say that
Mandy Muffin and her gang
are like an opposing force.

23:47.709 --> 23:51.417
Right? Am I going too
fast here? You're a really
hard read, Bill.

23:51.417 --> 23:54.625
You're wanna talk to
the boys upstairs
in Design about this.

23:54.625 --> 23:57.041
- I thought this was Design.
- Concept Design.

23:57.041 --> 24:00.291
The boys upstairs
are Design Concepts.
Big difference.

24:01.959 --> 24:04.959
I was thinking about
what you were saying
yesterday.

24:04.959 --> 24:07.208
How it would be a burden
to keep this place.

24:07.208 --> 24:09.875
The truth is,
your children live
all over the world,

24:09.875 --> 24:13.041
but they still live on
inside you, right?

24:13.041 --> 24:17.166
So will this house. If you
leave now, you'll always
have wonderful memories,

24:17.166 --> 24:19.375
before it becomes
something less to you.

24:19.375 --> 24:23.709
I just never pictured
this day happening.

24:23.709 --> 24:27.417
Believe me, I never thought
I'd be working in real estate
for my father,

24:27.417 --> 24:29.083
but things change, right?

24:30.083 --> 24:32.917
And...
sometimes for the best.

24:32.917 --> 24:35.208
At the end of the game,
you have to figure out

24:35.208 --> 24:39.750
that that orb-like thing
in the sky is the only
dependable source of energy.

24:39.750 --> 24:41.917
- Cool, man.
- You guys like it?

24:41.917 --> 24:43.750
- Love it.
- Awesome. What do we do?

24:43.750 --> 24:45.917
A little prelim work?
How does that work?

24:45.917 --> 24:49.875
- We don't have any say in that.
- They told me to come
and see you guys.

24:49.875 --> 24:51.875
Who told you that?

24:56.083 --> 24:59.709
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Have a nice day.

25:01.083 --> 25:02.750
Yes! Yes!

25:04.667 --> 25:06.333
Bye now.

25:10.625 --> 25:13.458
Hey. I'm glad
you guys could make it.
That's great.

25:14.333 --> 25:16.583
[jazz music]

25:19.917 --> 25:22.458
Wow.

25:22.458 --> 25:25.250
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- You look incredible.

25:25.250 --> 25:26.917
Thanks.

25:26.917 --> 25:28.375
And I got your message.

25:28.375 --> 25:30.166
Yeah, I know.
It's just these people.

25:30.166 --> 25:33.458
I don't know if
tonight's the best night
to reveal everything.

25:33.458 --> 25:35.792
Role-playing's always been
part of the job.

25:35.792 --> 25:37.667
- I'm sorry. It's not me...
- Stop.

25:37.667 --> 25:40.792
Well, Hillman, who is
this beautiful woman?

25:40.792 --> 25:44.041
This is Heather.
This is Arnold Fletcher,
the guest of honor.

25:44.041 --> 25:46.458
- His wife, Catherine.
- Nice to meet you both.

25:46.458 --> 25:48.834
- You too.
- Are you having a good time?

25:48.834 --> 25:51.583
- He couldn't be
having more fun.
- Good, I'm glad.

25:51.583 --> 25:53.291
And have you two been
together long?

25:53.291 --> 25:55.417
Yeah, we've been out
a few times.

25:55.417 --> 25:57.667
- Four.
- Actually, I think
it's only three.

25:57.667 --> 25:59.166
Huh.

25:59.166 --> 26:01.750
- And what do you do, dear?
- I'm a chiropractor.

26:10.166 --> 26:12.333
[car engine shuts off]

26:14.500 --> 26:17.417
This better have
something to do
with an apology.

26:23.500 --> 26:24.709
I'm waiting.

26:32.875 --> 26:35.667
You know, you can't just
put a sign up there.

26:35.667 --> 26:38.375
Someone actually has to
want to sell their home.

26:38.375 --> 26:41.458
Thanks for the tip.
No wonder you're
the top agent.

26:45.041 --> 26:47.625
She wants four and a half.
I think you can get six.

26:48.959 --> 26:53.166
Wait. You got it?
I can get six?

26:53.166 --> 26:54.709
It's yours.

26:55.959 --> 26:57.834
You want a closer look?

26:58.875 --> 27:01.208
She's out for a few hours.

27:01.208 --> 27:04.667
[man] I don't think taking him
out for a meal could hurt.

27:06.333 --> 27:08.250
Planning your
partner promotion?

27:08.250 --> 27:11.667
Yeah, if only
it were that easy.

27:11.667 --> 27:14.959
- What are you doing?
- [man] Offer a lunch
with the kid.

27:14.959 --> 27:19.709
Let him think it's in
the cards. Got to give him
credit for trying.

27:19.709 --> 27:25.500
Even if partner's
not gonna happen
for him. [chuckles]

27:26.208 --> 27:28.417
Adam, wait.

28:02.792 --> 28:04.458
[Deena] Nic?

28:04.458 --> 28:06.417
- I'm all right.
- Honey.

28:06.417 --> 28:08.083
I'm all right. [sobs]

28:10.125 --> 28:12.125
Oh, my.

28:12.125 --> 28:15.750
I wanna help.
I just wanna make you
feel better, but...

28:15.750 --> 28:17.333
...but I don't know how.

28:19.500 --> 28:22.083
I don't think you can.
I'm sorry.

28:35.250 --> 28:37.208
You OK?

28:37.208 --> 28:39.500
Why does everyone
have to be so fake?

28:39.500 --> 28:41.834
You know? I don't get it.
I'm a big boy.

28:43.500 --> 28:46.834
I may need your friend's
chiropractic skills
in the morning.

28:46.834 --> 28:51.000
Yeah. Well, actually,
she's just studying
to be one.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.667
- I see.
- Yeah. She's actually
just a dancer.

28:53.667 --> 28:55.166
- Maybe we should...
- No.

28:55.166 --> 28:58.000
I think someone should be
honest tonight, right?

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
- I was once a dancer.
What style?
- Hmm, depends on the song.

29:04.917 --> 29:08.625
I work at a place called
the Jaguar Lounge.
On Olympic?

29:15.250 --> 29:18.583
I don't know how you did it,
but nicely done.

29:18.583 --> 29:21.583
Opening my mouth
doesn't always
get me into trouble.

29:22.792 --> 29:24.125
I bet.

29:28.667 --> 29:32.208
So if we sell this house,
do you wanna split
the commission?

29:33.542 --> 29:35.458
Sure, sure.
I could use some cash.

29:39.291 --> 29:41.542
Seems like we make
a pretty good team.

29:41.542 --> 29:44.625
Yeah. Yeah, as long
as I do all the work.

- Actually,
I made 'em for you.
- All of them?

31:23.667 --> 31:27.125
I made one batch and
they weren't very good.

31:27.125 --> 31:31.208
So then I made a second batch
and they were better,
but not great.

31:31.208 --> 31:33.667
So then I made a third batch
and I just...

31:33.667 --> 31:36.834
I did a few things
differently.

31:36.834 --> 31:40.959

- OK.
- No, no, no.

31:52.667 --> 31:54.667
This one's
your best bet.

Oh, my God. This is
the greatest cupcake
I've ever had in my life.

32:05.250 --> 32:07.875
And you say you don't have
any skills?

32:07.875 --> 32:11.083
You're a master cupcaker.
You could sell these
and make a fortune.

32:11.083 --> 32:12.542
- Right.
- I'm serious.

32:12.542 --> 32:15.709

- Bringing a stripper
to the party?
- Don't.

I don't care if she has
a heart of gold right now.

32:36.709 --> 32:39.625
'Cause that's all she was
to those people. A stripper.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.667
Then you parade her around
as your girl

32:41.667 --> 32:43.709
a month after you get left
at the altar.

32:43.709 --> 32:46.166
And then you announce
what she did for a living.

The only good news
is a lot of people
had as much to drink as you

32:49.291 --> 32:52.291

so if you wanna
make partner...

I'm not gonna make partner,
Jimmy. I won't.

Fletcher doesn't make
the decisions.

32:58.792 --> 33:02.250
Well, even if I did,

Years of law school.
The eighty-hour weeks.

33:14.709 --> 33:18.208
If you don't make
partner here, you're not
making it anywhere else.

33:18.208 --> 33:20.417
Not after all this time.

33:20.417 --> 33:23.583
You gotta make some
choices. What's really
important to you?

- Can we talk?
- Sure.

35:07.125 --> 35:09.125
You've got four floors.

35:11.375 --> 35:13.792
So?

35:13.792 --> 35:17.375
- Well, hi, for starters.
- Hi.

35:17.375 --> 35:20.417
I want you to know
I'm sorry we got
interrupted last night.

35:20.417 --> 35:21.792
I'm not.

35:22.458 --> 35:24.458
OK.

35:24.458 --> 35:26.750
Look, it's not gonna
happen between us.

35:26.750 --> 35:30.417
I've worked here
for five years, I'm one of
the most respected agents,

35:30.417 --> 35:34.709
and I'm not gonna jeopardize
that by getting involved
with the boss's son.

35:34.709 --> 35:38.750
We got a little...
caught up in the moment
last night. It happens.

35:38.750 --> 35:40.875
You were a lot
caught up in the moment.

35:40.875 --> 35:44.250
As far as I'm concerned,
last night never happened.

35:44.250 --> 35:46.875
From now on, it's strictly
business between us.

36:02.500 --> 36:05.250
Hey. Great job
on the Elizaldé house.

36:05.250 --> 36:08.625
- It's Bridget's, actually.
- Yeah, I heard.

36:12.709 --> 36:15.750
I also heard
who really got it done.

36:15.750 --> 36:18.875
- I decided
to let you go early.
- You're firing me?

36:18.875 --> 36:22.291
No. I'm gonna let you
go out and do your thing.
Orientation's over.

36:22.291 --> 36:26.792
I might as well
see what you can do
sooner than later.

36:26.792 --> 36:27.792
Thank you.

36:31.625 --> 36:33.750
Thinking of doing
a little decorating?

36:33.750 --> 36:37.250
Well, I'm not really
the decorating type.

36:37.250 --> 36:39.291
I remember.

36:39.291 --> 36:42.542
You'd never even unpack
your bags when you'd
come to visit me.

36:43.792 --> 36:46.792
I never really
felt at home there.

36:48.125 --> 36:50.208
Hopefully you'll
feel at home here.

36:50.208 --> 36:54.000
Yeah. Yeah,
I was actually, uh,
just doing that.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
See you.

37:13.542 --> 37:17.333
So you gave them
cereal for dinner?

37:17.333 --> 37:20.917
I told you, Deena.
I overcooked their
fish sticks, OK?

37:20.917 --> 37:23.333
The girls are fine.
Everything's gonna be OK.

37:23.333 --> 37:25.417
OK, Dave. I was
just kidding around.

37:25.417 --> 37:28.834
I don't want to be
critiqued every time
we do a trade-off.

37:28.834 --> 37:31.917
It's hard enough as it is.
I got stuff going on
with work.

37:31.917 --> 37:34.166
I guess they didn't
waste any time.

37:34.166 --> 37:36.542
No, everything's fine.
It's great.

37:36.542 --> 37:39.083
I'm having a great time,
working on cool stuff.

37:39.083 --> 37:41.208
- It's just deadlines.
- OK.

37:42.500 --> 37:45.709
Well, um,
actually, that's...

37:45.709 --> 37:50.500
I kind of wanted
to talk to you about
an idea that I had.

37:50.500 --> 37:53.125
- About my work?
- No, for me. Um...

37:53.125 --> 37:58.166
Remember how we used
to talk about me
selling my cupcakes?

37:59.500 --> 38:01.709
Now that I'm gonna have
a few free days a week,

38:01.709 --> 38:06.667
I started to think maybe
I could get a business
off the ground.

38:06.667 --> 38:10.166
- A business?
- A cupcake business.

38:10.166 --> 38:13.375
- You think it's a bad idea.
- No. No.

38:13.375 --> 38:15.709
- Yeah, you do.
- No, I think
it's a great idea.

38:15.709 --> 38:17.041
- Really?
- Yeah.

38:17.041 --> 38:18.917
Yeah? Because
I kind of thought

38:18.917 --> 38:21.000
you'd think
it was stupid, you know?

38:21.000 --> 38:24.250
Bored old housewife
just looking
for something to do.

38:24.250 --> 38:26.500
Make cupcakes.

38:26.500 --> 38:28.667
- I think it's great.
- Yeah?

38:32.083 --> 38:34.583
[muffled music]

38:45.709 --> 38:47.041
- Adam.
- Hey.

38:47.041 --> 38:49.750
- Hey. What are you doing here?
- Do you have a second?

38:49.750 --> 38:53.375
- Actually, I'm late. What's up?
- Everything OK, Summer?

38:53.375 --> 38:56.792
- I'm fine, Tony.
- [sighs] Uh, uh...

38:56.792 --> 38:58.792
Can we go somewhere?

38:58.792 --> 39:01.875
- What's wrong?
- We need to talk.

39:01.875 --> 39:04.041
- About what?
- Us.

39:07.667 --> 39:09.959
I think it's a good area
for us to talk about.

39:09.959 --> 39:11.959
Hi. Come on in.

39:14.083 --> 39:16.458
I thought you guys
might like some cupcakes.

39:16.458 --> 39:19.208
My friend made them for me

39:19.208 --> 39:21.750
because she thought they
might make me feel better.

39:21.750 --> 39:24.291
- And did they?
- Not really.

39:24.792 --> 39:25.792
Please.

39:31.625 --> 39:35.417
Sorry. Just the box.
You stand.

39:37.750 --> 39:39.750
Could you tell us
your name?

39:41.667 --> 39:43.333
I'm Nicole.

39:45.250 --> 39:46.250
I'm a widow.

39:48.625 --> 39:53.959
My husband Angelo died
in a car accident in Italy
a few weeks ago... and...

39:53.959 --> 39:56.083
- I'm sorry. [sobs]
- It's OK.

40:02.250 --> 40:05.333
All my friends...

40:05.333 --> 40:09.291
...they keep trying
to make me feel better
with cupcakes and flowers.

40:10.500 --> 40:12.166
"Cheer up!"

40:13.542 --> 40:15.667
Like, God forbid,

40:15.667 --> 40:19.542
I'd be sad that
I'm never gonna see
this man again

40:19.542 --> 40:21.959
or he'll never see
his child.

40:24.500 --> 40:27.667
Or it's, "How are you?"

40:29.792 --> 40:34.000
But no one sticks around
long enough to find out,
do they?

40:36.959 --> 40:39.250
Or then there's...

40:41.083 --> 40:42.917
"Are you OK?"

40:42.917 --> 40:47.125
No, I'm not OK.
You know that.
You know I'm not OK.

40:49.083 --> 40:51.375
I don't know.
Maybe they're just...

40:52.917 --> 40:55.667
...afraid or they
don't understand.

40:55.667 --> 40:57.709
They don't.

40:57.709 --> 40:59.667
- Do they?
- [all] No.

41:01.667 --> 41:03.333
[laughs]

41:03.333 --> 41:04.959
Good.

41:04.959 --> 41:06.959
I mean, not good. Just...

41:08.041 --> 41:10.417
It's good that...

41:10.417 --> 41:14.250
...I'm not the only one
that... feels this way.

41:14.250 --> 41:16.250
But the cupcakes
look good.

41:17.291 --> 41:20.709
There's plenty
for everyone. Thank you.

41:27.083 --> 41:29.875
- Cupcakes?
- She thinks there's
a market there.

41:29.875 --> 41:32.208
- You OK with that?
- I don't know.

41:32.208 --> 41:34.959
It'd be worse if she was
designing video games.

41:34.959 --> 41:36.875
- Cupcakes.
- They do kick ass.

41:36.875 --> 41:40.125
- They are really, really good.
- Just make sure they're moist.

41:40.125 --> 41:41.834
Nothing worse
than a dry cupcake.

41:41.834 --> 41:44.458
Yeah, moist's the key.
Supple even.

41:44.458 --> 41:47.000
Like the frosting
could bring the thing down.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.291
- I love cupcakes.
- Yeah, me too.

41:49.291 --> 41:52.792
Hey, listen, dude.
Thanks for letting me
stay here this long, huh?

41:52.792 --> 41:54.959
- Hey, no problem.
- It won't be forever.

41:54.959 --> 41:56.875
Yeah. Night, bro.

41:56.875 --> 41:58.542
Good night.

41:59.667 --> 42:02.375
[laughter]

42:05.583 --> 42:07.792
A-ha.

42:10.041 --> 42:12.125
- Oh, God!
- What? What's the matter?

42:12.125 --> 42:14.375
Technically, this is
only our fourth date.

42:14.375 --> 42:17.291
So are we not about to have sex
on our wedding night?

42:17.291 --> 42:19.250
Shut up.

42:19.250 --> 42:21.417
- All right. Here we go.
- Whoo-hoo!

42:26.333 --> 42:29.333
