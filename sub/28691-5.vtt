WEBVTT

00:07.863 --> 00:10.030
I can't take it. Where is she?

00:10.789 --> 00:13.359
Four months is... It's too long
to be away from her mother.

00:13.384 --> 00:15.060
Why did you send my baby so far away?

00:15.085 --> 00:17.421
Why did I send her so far away?

00:17.947 --> 00:20.188
Look. I know I said that
you could have her tonight,

00:20.213 --> 00:23.655
- but... I changed my mind.
- Are you kidding me right now?

00:23.680 --> 00:25.849
- No argument.
- Thank you.

00:25.947 --> 00:27.734
Jules! Jules!

00:27.759 --> 00:29.532
- Jules!
- Aah!

00:32.931 --> 00:35.007
Would you listen to those rolling r's?

00:35.032 --> 00:37.078
You can't possibly be our daughter.

00:37.103 --> 00:40.437
- I'm gonna need to see some I.D.
- It's still me, Dad.

00:40.611 --> 00:42.441
Just take it over here.

00:42.466 --> 00:45.367
Bella tell me about this scarf.

00:45.392 --> 00:46.885
It's a <isciarpa, mom.

00:46.909 --> 00:49.114
And the purse is Milan street style...

00:49.139 --> 00:51.906
It's just like mine. We're twins!

00:52.021 --> 00:53.837
Hey, Matt, why
don't I just take her?

00:53.862 --> 00:56.785
- I'll bring her back tomorrow.
- No, that's not OK. We agreed...

00:56.810 --> 00:59.440
I feel awful. You didn't
get my text, did you?

00:59.914 --> 01:01.313
I actually already have a ride.

01:04.286 --> 01:06.712
<iBuongiorno, sir! <iSignora Dorasay...

01:06.737 --> 01:08.734
- Liam! Look at you!
- Liam!

01:08.759 --> 01:10.312
Liam flew home yesterday.

01:10.337 --> 01:13.238
His parents bought him a moped.

01:13.512 --> 01:15.679
- Is that thing safe?
- Absolutely, sir.

01:15.704 --> 01:17.234
We drove one all over Italy.

01:17.259 --> 01:18.585
- You did?
- Yeah.

01:18.610 --> 01:21.941
- You ready? OK. Watch the curb.
- Yeah. OK.

01:21.966 --> 01:24.656
OK, bye! I'll talk to you later, guys.
I love you. <iCiao.

01:26.454 --> 01:30.158
Did you know that they rode
a scooter all over Italy?

01:30.743 --> 01:33.499
Well, everyone rides scooters in Italy.

01:33.524 --> 01:36.116
I don't think they do.

01:37.986 --> 01:40.460
Come on! He had a beard?

01:40.485 --> 01:42.842
I definitely saw stubble.

01:42.867 --> 01:45.833
- It was only four months!
- Four months is like two years

01:45.858 --> 01:48.685
- in a teenage body.
- Not helping, Everett.

01:49.007 --> 01:51.552
I'm sure Jules hasn't changed
as much as you think.

01:51.577 --> 01:53.826
Just give her a chance to
get her feet on the ground.

01:54.184 --> 01:55.912
Where are we going?

01:56.014 --> 01:57.817
I told you. New client.

01:58.147 --> 02:00.488
Does this new client have a name?

02:00.513 --> 02:02.708
Cassie Lewis.

02:02.733 --> 02:04.880
We roomed together in college.

02:04.905 --> 02:07.653
- Wow! Way to bury the lead.
- I thought

02:07.678 --> 02:10.452
your father-daughter issues
were much more pressing.

02:10.477 --> 02:14.682
And what exactly does your
ex college roomate want?

02:14.707 --> 02:17.466
"Get here as quick as you can."

02:17.491 --> 02:21.170
Where exactly is "here"?

02:28.117 --> 02:30.385
Belanger Estates?

02:30.410 --> 02:32.995
You know these guys are famous
for their Bordeaux blends?

02:33.020 --> 02:34.876
That's a smoothie, right?

02:35.570 --> 02:37.240
Kidding.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:47.216 --> 02:48.412
Listen.

02:48.437 --> 02:50.357
You may hear some stories
from a long time ago...

02:50.381 --> 02:52.895
The College Years.

02:53.107 --> 02:55.400
Can't be any worse than
that time you borrowed

02:55.425 --> 02:57.665
- your dad's patrol car...
- I thought your hockey career

02:57.689 --> 03:00.795
- affected your long-term memory.
- No, no. Not so much.

03:00.820 --> 03:02.380
You might as well tell me now, Everett.

03:02.404 --> 03:04.847
- Save yourself the embarrassment.
- Ange!

03:05.537 --> 03:07.842
Thank god you're here.

03:08.091 --> 03:10.112
Wow! You have not changed.

03:10.153 --> 03:12.951
- Cassie Lewis, this is my partner.
- Matt Shade.

03:12.976 --> 03:16.811
Hockey player turned PI.
Very sexy transition, P.S.

03:16.836 --> 03:18.668
- You do your homework.
- Which is how I know

03:18.693 --> 03:23.344
that you two are the best. Follow me.

03:26.357 --> 03:27.925
I've been a wine specialist

03:27.950 --> 03:31.200
with Trent Auctions now for five years.

03:31.319 --> 03:32.942
First day on the job,

03:32.967 --> 03:35.752
I reached out to Martin
Belanger to see if he wanted

03:35.777 --> 03:38.241
to sell off some of
his historic cellar.

03:38.266 --> 03:40.908
Took some time, but he finally agreed

03:40.933 --> 03:45.120
- to offer up a few of his best.
- Wait, he's not selling...

03:45.145 --> 03:47.156
The Winston '45?

03:47.181 --> 03:51.653
- What's the Winston '45?
- It's the Holy Grail of wines.

03:51.678 --> 03:55.616
There's only one in the world.
It's... it's priceless.

03:55.641 --> 03:57.446
How much do you think
you'll get for it?

03:57.471 --> 04:00.184
We're anticipating half
a million or more.

04:00.209 --> 04:03.339
- Is it here? Can I see it?
- No one can.

04:04.406 --> 04:07.227
The Holy Grail has been stolen.

04:50.435 --> 04:52.159
- When was the last time
you saw it?

04:52.184 --> 04:55.114
Last night before I left.
That was around seven.

04:55.139 --> 04:56.745
Is this door locked all the time?

04:56.770 --> 04:58.874
Always. You need a five digit keycode

04:58.899 --> 05:01.709
- to lock and unlock the door.
- Who else has the code?

05:01.734 --> 05:04.749
I don't know. There's over
fifty workers at the vineyard.

05:04.774 --> 05:06.457
But they don't all
work the night shift.

05:06.482 --> 05:09.960
- We'll have to ask Martin...
- No, no, no. You can't do that.

05:10.287 --> 05:12.917
In order to convince Martin
to sell the Winston '45,

05:12.942 --> 05:15.204
my company had to put
up a guaranteed minimum

05:15.229 --> 05:17.429
of a quarter of a million. If
we don't sell that bottle,

05:17.453 --> 05:19.546
we're out the money.
And I'll be shilling

05:19.571 --> 05:22.890
- dessert wine in the Balkans.
- OK. When's the auction?

05:22.915 --> 05:25.304
- Three days.
- Prospective buyers get

05:25.329 --> 05:27.705
a preview at the lots on offer, right?

05:27.730 --> 05:30.297
The serious ones get VIP
access to the vineyard.

05:30.322 --> 05:32.380
- Perfect.
- Why's that perfect?

05:32.405 --> 05:34.266
Because we just found our cover.

05:34.291 --> 05:37.117
We're gonna bid on the Winston '45.

05:39.138 --> 05:42.006
My family has been making
wine in the Pomerol region

05:42.031 --> 05:45.330
since the 1700s, but the Winston '45

05:45.355 --> 05:47.353
is the greatest vintage
they ever produced.

05:47.378 --> 05:49.397
This one isn't bad, either. I mean...

05:49.422 --> 05:52.820
It's no '47 Cheval Blanc.
But then again, what is?

05:52.845 --> 05:54.867
Well! A brilliant hockey player

05:54.892 --> 05:58.733
and a connoisseur of fine wine.
We should do a Shadow vintage.

05:58.758 --> 06:00.772
Yeah!

06:01.096 --> 06:03.401
Why is it called the Winston '45?

06:03.426 --> 06:06.491
Well... The bombing
during World War Two

06:06.516 --> 06:10.303
destroyed most of the harvest,
so only six bottles survived.

06:10.670 --> 06:12.048
So after the war was over,

06:12.066 --> 06:15.439
my grandfather took five
bottles and sent them

06:15.676 --> 06:19.142
with this Spitfire pilot
who flew over the Channel

06:19.167 --> 06:21.854
and delivered them in person
to Winston Churchill.

06:21.879 --> 06:25.444
- For the celebration of VE Day.
- And you got the last bottle?

06:25.469 --> 06:28.477
Well... It was passed down to
my father, and then to me.

06:28.501 --> 06:30.141
Why sell the Winston
when it means so much

06:30.165 --> 06:33.254
- to your family?
- Cassie. She convinced me

06:33.279 --> 06:35.259
that you can't keep something
locked up forever.

06:35.284 --> 06:37.990
And... if the bottle gets
what we think it will,

06:38.015 --> 06:40.881
it will enable me to
expand my product line,

06:41.052 --> 06:44.303
allow us to produce
wines from varietals

06:44.328 --> 06:47.396
and even a second label.

06:50.549 --> 06:52.931
Does everyone here at the vineyard

06:52.956 --> 06:55.116
know where you keep the Winston '45?

06:55.141 --> 06:57.426
Of course. Yeah, I
mean, it's no secret.

06:57.451 --> 06:59.729
Isn't that a little risky?
Keeping a priceless bottle

06:59.754 --> 07:01.820
- of wine within easy reach?
- Well,

07:01.845 --> 07:04.536
I trust the people who
work for me, Miss Everett.

07:04.897 --> 07:06.662
- Let me show you the bottle.
- No! Don't!

07:06.687 --> 07:09.221
That's fine. We've taken up
more than enough of your time.

07:09.246 --> 07:11.441
Maybe we could just...
meet with your authenticator?

07:11.466 --> 07:14.905
Yeah, yeah. Of course.
Simone. She is amazing.

07:14.930 --> 07:17.321
She knows my wine better than I do.

07:19.336 --> 07:22.204
Sweetness on the attack.
I get hints of...

07:22.229 --> 07:24.873
baked apple and pear.

07:24.898 --> 07:27.332
Star bright. Medium viscosity.

07:28.186 --> 07:29.676
I get...

07:29.701 --> 07:31.434
crème brûlée.

07:31.696 --> 07:34.564
- I get... grape.
- Yes, well...

07:34.589 --> 07:36.798
It's from a limited run

07:36.823 --> 07:40.318
two seasons ago. And, in my opinion,

07:40.343 --> 07:42.741
the vintage is still trying
to find its identity.

07:42.766 --> 07:46.685
So you authenticate all
the wine in the auction?

07:46.710 --> 07:50.402
- All 600 of them.
- A lot of trips to the cellar.

07:50.427 --> 07:53.436
- Comes with the territory.
- And the Winston '45?

07:53.461 --> 07:55.962
- Is it worth the hype?
- God, yes.

07:55.987 --> 07:57.632
It'll be the most exquisite thing

07:57.657 --> 08:00.116
anyone has the privilege of tasting.

08:00.234 --> 08:03.034
How do you authenticate a
bottle you can't open?

08:03.059 --> 08:05.292
I test it for clues to its history.

08:05.575 --> 08:08.369
Cork condition, viscosity,
that sort of thing.

08:08.394 --> 08:11.286
- Have you completed your tests?
- Yesterday.

08:11.478 --> 08:15.398
- Must have been a late night.
- Pff! Not as late as the cellar hands.

08:17.951 --> 08:20.624
- What's a cellar hand?
- Cellar hands do everything

08:20.649 --> 08:22.515
around the vineyard, from inventory

08:22.540 --> 08:25.671
- to scrubbing bungs.
- What's a bung?

08:25.696 --> 08:27.952
- You don't wanna know.
- Eww!

08:28.368 --> 08:30.332
Judging by the description
Cassie gave us,

08:30.357 --> 08:32.597
- I think we just found our man.
- Looks like he's headed

08:32.621 --> 08:35.255
- on a trip.
- Hey! Juan Carlos!

08:35.490 --> 08:39.486
Why do the bad guys always run?

08:47.450 --> 08:50.094
Aaah!

08:51.036 --> 08:54.414
- I don't have it.
- And yet you know it's missing.

08:54.439 --> 08:56.301
And you were in the
main cellar last night.

08:56.326 --> 08:59.093
I was doing inventory. I
got a call on my phone.

08:59.817 --> 09:01.749
I went outside to take it.

09:02.483 --> 09:04.476
- I forgot to lock the door.
- Let me guess.

09:04.501 --> 09:06.951
When you got back, the
Winston '45 was gone.

09:06.976 --> 09:09.376
The bottle's not here. Where is it?

09:09.473 --> 09:11.339
I didn't steal it.

09:11.427 --> 09:13.437
That wine, it's like a
symbol of peace, man.

09:13.462 --> 09:16.267
- It's like... sacred to me.
- Then why did you run?

09:16.641 --> 09:18.843
- I thought you were him.
- Him who?

09:18.868 --> 09:20.894
The Wolf.

09:26.703 --> 09:28.971
The e-mails started
coming in a few days ago.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.811
Asking me if I'd steal the
Winston '45 for money.

09:32.618 --> 09:35.047
It's an anonymous server.
I can't trace it.

09:35.072 --> 09:37.461
"I'm all junked up on the 45."

09:38.123 --> 09:40.611
"Don't be a piker, I'll
make it worth your while."

09:40.636 --> 09:42.655
"Get it, or I'll tell your boss."

09:42.680 --> 09:45.780
- They're all signed "The Wolf".
- Did you ever reply?

09:45.805 --> 09:47.085
No.

09:47.110 --> 09:49.758
What does he mean,
"I'll tell your boss"?

09:49.888 --> 09:51.621
I'm here on a visa.

09:51.646 --> 09:53.600
I'm only supposed to work
at the vineyard, but...

09:53.625 --> 09:56.559
- You got a second job.
- I send money home.

09:56.783 --> 09:59.802
I love this vineyard,
but I need both jobs.

10:00.080 --> 10:01.579
Don't tell Martin, OK?

10:01.604 --> 10:04.713
Fine. But we're gonna
need your passwords.

10:06.452 --> 10:08.451
I think he's telling the truth.

10:08.476 --> 10:11.395
- He had motive and opportunity.
- But the Winston '45

10:11.420 --> 10:13.882
was taken last night. Why wait so long?

10:13.907 --> 10:15.667
The guy's been a cellar
hand here for months.

10:15.692 --> 10:17.332
Maybe he didn't know
how much it was worth

10:17.356 --> 10:19.605
- until the Wolf contacted him.
- It makes more sense

10:19.630 --> 10:22.265
that it was one of the
people here for the auction.

10:22.290 --> 10:23.852
How would they get in so late?

10:23.877 --> 10:25.911
Look around. There's no security here.

10:25.936 --> 10:27.676
Except for a lock on the cellar door,

10:27.701 --> 10:30.718
- which was left open.
- We should talk ask Cassie.

10:30.758 --> 10:33.054
- She knows the buyers.
- Maybe she can tell us

10:33.079 --> 10:36.866
- if there's a wolf in the pack.
- Read the headline.

10:37.229 --> 10:40.562
"Famous wine stolen from estate
auction." How did this leak?

10:40.587 --> 10:42.379
I have no idea.

10:42.570 --> 10:46.479
- It's everywhere.
- Yeah. Which means I'm nowhere.

10:46.504 --> 10:50.077
My career is officially over. Yeah.

10:56.616 --> 10:58.577
Cassie!

11:00.197 --> 11:02.932
You knew about this? Why
didn't you tell me?

11:02.957 --> 11:05.548
I thought I could get the Winston
back before the auction.

11:05.573 --> 11:07.791
The sale of that bottle
was going to breathe life

11:07.816 --> 11:10.817
into this vineyard. Without
it, my expansion plans go out

11:10.842 --> 11:13.531
- the window. You knew this!
- We can get it back for you.

11:13.556 --> 11:15.890
Forgive me, but a hockey
player and his girlfriend?

11:15.915 --> 11:17.936
- They're private investigators.
- Cassie hired us

11:17.961 --> 11:20.524
out of her own pocket because
of her loyalty to you.

11:20.549 --> 11:22.866
- And her commission.
- No, I don't care

11:22.891 --> 11:25.061
about the commission. You can have it.

11:25.422 --> 11:27.914
We can get the Winston '45 back.

11:27.939 --> 11:30.470
Just give us until the
day of the auction.

11:30.495 --> 11:34.117
- Yeah, what choice do I have?
- OK.

11:38.545 --> 11:39.976
Cassie's sending over a list

11:40.001 --> 11:42.037
of all the registered
buyers for the auction.

11:42.070 --> 11:46.606
I'll get Zoe going on
Juan Carlos' emails...

11:46.866 --> 11:48.714
She's still at her auntie's house

11:48.739 --> 11:51.166
- up north. Remember?
- Yeah.

11:53.219 --> 11:55.741
Looking a little flushed
there, partner.

11:56.008 --> 11:57.710
I am not used to day-drinking.

11:57.735 --> 12:00.267
Everywhere we turned around,
there was another glass

12:00.292 --> 12:01.858
- in front of us.
- You weren't supposed

12:01.883 --> 12:04.507
to drink them. Swirl, sniff,

12:04.532 --> 12:06.758
sip, swish, spit.

12:13.929 --> 12:15.805
It's so peaceful out here.

12:15.830 --> 12:17.630
You miss the screech of the streetcar,

12:17.655 --> 12:20.288
the smell of raw sewage?

12:20.730 --> 12:23.671
I don't know. Cassie has a
pretty glamourous life.

12:23.696 --> 12:25.696
It's the one she always wanted...

12:25.721 --> 12:27.668
Sounds like admiration.

12:28.582 --> 12:31.613
Cassie told me you're
just the same old Angie.

12:31.638 --> 12:35.367
Smart, spontaneous, stunning...

12:38.103 --> 12:41.301
And sleeping.

12:44.309 --> 12:46.862
Baby girl! I missed you so much.

12:46.887 --> 12:49.013
- I missed you too, Dad.
- Yeah, well, I missed lunch.

12:49.038 --> 12:50.991
So why don't we order food in

12:51.016 --> 12:54.684
and then Jules can regale
us with tales from Italy.

12:54.709 --> 12:57.730
I'd love to, but a bunch of us
that just got back are going out.

12:57.755 --> 13:00.100
Can we talk later? I
mean, it's only 7:30.

13:00.125 --> 13:03.609
- We never ate before 9 in Italy.
- Sure, honey, yeah.

13:03.684 --> 13:05.865
- Have fun! We'll talk later.
- Bye. I miss you guys!

13:05.890 --> 13:09.874
Bye, sweetie.

13:09.899 --> 13:13.100
- Well...
- Is it just me

13:13.125 --> 13:15.814
or does she seem like a
totally different person?

13:16.003 --> 13:18.298
You mean older, more mature?

13:18.481 --> 13:20.051
As if her perspective has been altered

13:20.076 --> 13:22.218
from four months of
international travel?

13:22.243 --> 13:23.884
- Yeah, something like that.
- Yeah.

13:23.909 --> 13:26.532
- Should I be worried?
- No.

13:27.085 --> 13:29.006
I've seen this movie before.

13:29.477 --> 13:31.761
There was this 16-year-old boy

13:31.786 --> 13:34.709
who once came back from his
first year in junior hockey.

13:34.873 --> 13:36.366
Barely looked his dad in the eye.

13:36.391 --> 13:39.458
- Yeah. Cut to the chase, Dad.
- She just got home.

13:39.740 --> 13:44.146
Let her adjust. Why don't
I make us something?

13:51.648 --> 13:54.159
So... These are the registered bidders

13:54.184 --> 13:56.133
on one of the finest
wines in the world.

13:56.158 --> 13:58.359
They're just a bunch
of entitled asshats.

13:58.384 --> 14:00.496
For most of them, it's
not even about the wine.

14:00.521 --> 14:02.563
The rarer, the better.

14:02.588 --> 14:04.587
Which is gonna make it
that much more difficult

14:04.612 --> 14:06.981
to figure out which one is
responsible for the theft.

14:09.412 --> 14:13.245
- Hey, what's a "piker"?
- A gambler who places small bets.

14:13.270 --> 14:15.030
This Wolf guy has his own language

14:15.055 --> 14:17.355
and it's pretty cheesy.

14:17.380 --> 14:20.710
- Back in the day, when I had money...
- By "day" you mean '90s?

14:21.059 --> 14:23.268
I met with a group of
investment brokers

14:23.293 --> 14:25.053
who were trying to start
their own hedge fund

14:25.077 --> 14:27.545
and they all spoke the same way.
Like they were...

14:27.570 --> 14:30.131
- gangsters from East London.
- One of our asshats

14:30.156 --> 14:32.821
is a commodities trader.
Aaron Brisbane.

14:36.871 --> 14:38.287
Says here

14:38.312 --> 14:40.327
he toured the vineyard the
day before yesterday.

14:40.650 --> 14:42.364
If he's The Wolf,

14:42.389 --> 14:45.246
how do we get him to admit
that he stole the Winston '45?

14:45.271 --> 14:48.350
That's easy. We buy him a drink.

14:55.010 --> 14:58.227
- Another one of these, miss.
- You betcha.

15:04.210 --> 15:05.854
Angelina!

15:05.879 --> 15:08.346
Mr. Shade. What's your poison?

15:08.630 --> 15:10.682
A Latour from your private stock?

15:10.707 --> 15:13.242
Come on, it's Wenesday afternoon!

15:13.267 --> 15:15.874
The Latour is more of a Friday wine.

15:15.899 --> 15:18.408
How about this one?

15:18.649 --> 15:21.494
Of course, sir.

15:22.572 --> 15:25.060
Did you just turn down a
first growth Bordeaux?

15:25.550 --> 15:28.794
- I sure did.
- Aaron Brisbane.

15:29.260 --> 15:31.432
- Matt Shade.
- The Shadow?

15:31.745 --> 15:33.666
No way. Now I'm definitely
gonna stick around

15:33.691 --> 15:35.611
to find out what Matt Shade
drinks on Wednesdays.

15:35.635 --> 15:38.223
How about the Winston '45?

15:39.718 --> 15:42.887
Unbelievable what happened. You
keep it cellared for 70 years,

15:42.912 --> 15:45.193
then three days before you reap
the reward it gets stolen.

15:45.217 --> 15:47.465
The reward would be
just getting to try it.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.912
Man, I'd give my left you-know-what

15:49.937 --> 15:52.478
for the chance to taste that.
Actually, no,

15:52.503 --> 15:54.743
it'd have to be my right. I
think I gave my left one away

15:54.767 --> 15:57.300
for a bottle of 2000 DRC.

15:57.354 --> 15:59.912
Get ready to soar...

15:59.937 --> 16:03.582
with the 2012 Owl Valley Chardonnay.

16:04.282 --> 16:07.142
The 2012 Owl? Nice choice, Shadow.

16:07.167 --> 16:10.955
I've wanted to uncork that
juice for years. May I?

16:11.518 --> 16:13.494
Be my guest.

16:15.615 --> 16:17.615
Wow.

16:23.916 --> 16:25.913
I feel like I just
popped my cherry again.

16:25.938 --> 16:28.868
Here.

16:29.306 --> 16:31.450
A little thank you very much.

16:32.715 --> 16:35.347
- The Solera Club. What's this?
- Life-changing.

16:36.500 --> 16:38.524
Swing by tonight. I've got a bottle

16:38.549 --> 16:41.236
that'll get you so junked up
you won't care what day it is.

16:41.452 --> 16:43.950
8 o'clock. Don't be late

16:43.975 --> 16:46.168
and don't tell anyone.

16:50.890 --> 16:53.461
I think we may have
just found our Wolf.

16:53.860 --> 16:57.262
Are you kidding me? I've
heard of The Solera Club.

16:57.287 --> 16:58.924
- So who are they?
- They're a group

16:58.949 --> 17:01.566
of the wealthiest wine
connoisseurs in the city.

17:01.680 --> 17:03.482
They hold monthly tastings

17:03.507 --> 17:04.906
where they try to one-up each other

17:04.931 --> 17:07.068
with exclusive bottles of wine.

17:07.758 --> 17:10.454
You must have made
quite the impression.

17:10.480 --> 17:13.173
I think Mr. Brisbane
is easily impressed.

17:13.810 --> 17:16.055
What did Maz have to say for himself?

17:16.079 --> 17:18.255
He said to say hi and...

17:18.914 --> 17:21.586
that tracking a bottle
of wine is impossible.

17:22.676 --> 17:24.843
But we still have a solid lead, Cass.

17:24.867 --> 17:26.268
How do you know that Aaron Brisbane

17:26.291 --> 17:28.728
- has the Winston '45?
- Just a hunch,

17:28.753 --> 17:31.234
but it definitely turned his
head when I mentioned it.

17:31.259 --> 17:33.980
- So what's the next step?
- Our inside man here

17:34.005 --> 17:36.707
has a ticket to the ball.
Now all we need to do

17:36.732 --> 17:39.698
is turn him into a prince.

18:04.321 --> 18:07.142
- OK, Shade. We've got eyes.
- Can you hear us?

18:07.167 --> 18:11.863
Loud and clear. I'm
entering the Wolf's den.

18:14.667 --> 18:18.547
- Everyone take their seats.
- And there's our wolf.

18:20.344 --> 18:23.966
So... I've brought
something very special

18:24.079 --> 18:26.813
for you beautiful people tonight.
But...

18:26.838 --> 18:28.696
as is our custom, we're
gonna have a little fun

18:28.721 --> 18:30.595
before we reveal the treasure.

18:30.813 --> 18:32.695
You've each got a glass
in front of you.

18:35.422 --> 18:37.736
Gets the first taste of the real booty.

18:37.761 --> 18:39.699
Stems up, beautifuls.

18:40.665 --> 18:43.231
OK. Let's go through the grid, Matt.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.879
- Grid?
- Eyes, nose,

18:44.904 --> 18:47.681
tongue and quality.
Start with the eyes.

18:47.706 --> 18:50.159
- Tell me what you see.
- Good clarity.

18:51.058 --> 18:54.579
Rim variation indicates the
wine is at least 20 years old.

19:02.966 --> 19:05.030
Well, what does the nose give us?

19:05.192 --> 19:07.304
Red and black fruit.

19:07.329 --> 19:09.507
Olives and bell peppers.

19:11.037 --> 19:12.454
Tar.

19:12.479 --> 19:15.331
It's good. Is it
tobacco or smoked meat?

19:15.356 --> 19:19.779
- Smoked meat?
- Smoked meat.

19:20.144 --> 19:22.163
You're on fire, Shade.

19:27.589 --> 19:30.490
- It's from the Northern Rhone.
- Syrah...

19:30.728 --> 19:33.122
It's Ermitage.

19:33.368 --> 19:35.558
It's a Louis Marchand!

19:35.943 --> 19:38.918
One of the best vintages.

19:38.943 --> 19:41.824
'64, '72, '82 and '90.

19:42.153 --> 19:45.126
OK, so... 1 in 5 chance

19:45.151 --> 19:47.841
or 80 percent chance you get it wrong.

19:47.866 --> 19:51.071
- Not helping, Everett.
- I know what it is!

19:51.428 --> 19:54.300
A 1982 Petrus.

19:56.494 --> 19:59.495
Afraid not, Maddie. Anyone else?

19:59.760 --> 20:01.708
It's a Louis Marchand.

20:01.961 --> 20:03.923
And the vintage?

20:07.232 --> 20:09.337
1990.

20:09.726 --> 20:11.998
Winner! First taste
of the mystery bottle.

20:26.732 --> 20:30.251
That's it. That's the...

20:30.276 --> 20:33.397
The Winston '45? How did you...?

20:33.422 --> 20:35.459
Don't ask if you don't wanna know.

20:36.483 --> 20:38.267
You're actually gonna open it?

20:38.292 --> 20:40.218
That's the plan, superstar.

20:40.664 --> 20:44.139
- You gotta stop him!
- Shade! Grab it and run!

20:44.473 --> 20:46.473
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

20:49.474 --> 20:52.457
- Hey! Get back here!
- Start the car!

20:52.482 --> 20:55.678
Shade, watch out!

21:02.766 --> 21:06.178
My god!

21:06.371 --> 21:08.583
I'm so sorry, Cassie.

21:13.547 --> 21:16.335
So, the suspect is still not
talking, but don't worry,

21:16.360 --> 21:19.024
we'll crack him open like
a cheap bottle of wine.

21:19.475 --> 21:22.198
I wish we had better
news for you, Cassie.

21:22.223 --> 21:23.915
- Yeah.
- Maybe I do.

21:24.016 --> 21:25.042
Hey, Shade.

21:25.067 --> 21:27.657
That looks like... evidence.
And you touching it.

21:27.682 --> 21:30.310
Take a look at the glue
behind this label.

21:31.024 --> 21:33.237
Wow! It's clear!

21:33.262 --> 21:34.706
- So?
- That means it's new.

21:34.731 --> 21:37.730
- It should be yellow.
- This bottle's machine made.

21:37.755 --> 21:40.556
Chateau Belanger used hand-blown
bottles during the war.

21:40.581 --> 21:43.634
- So you're saying this puppy's a fake?
- Well, the label's real,

21:44.508 --> 21:46.586
but the wine and the bottle aren't.

21:46.611 --> 21:48.709
Which means the real Winston '45

21:48.734 --> 21:50.606
is still out there.

21:51.520 --> 21:55.176
Hey! Hey! Yeah?

21:57.930 --> 22:00.233
Let me do the talking, OK?

22:00.258 --> 22:01.714
Where'd you get the bottle, Aaron?

22:01.875 --> 22:04.149
Is it English that's the problem?

22:04.174 --> 22:06.179
You lied to me, Shadow.

22:06.789 --> 22:09.090
And you cost me a lot of money.

22:09.115 --> 22:11.224
He's not the one who sold you the fake.

22:11.249 --> 22:13.329
- What are you talking about?
- The bottle you bought

22:13.353 --> 22:16.933
wasn't the real Winston '45.
Someone made a fool out of you.

22:17.162 --> 22:18.627
You think he's more upset

22:18.652 --> 22:20.537
about the money or his pride?

22:20.562 --> 22:22.696
I think his money is long gone.

22:22.721 --> 22:25.398
OK. You got one chance
to make this right.

22:25.423 --> 22:27.354
Where'd you get the bottle?

22:28.162 --> 22:30.385
Chong's Chinese Palace?

22:30.410 --> 22:32.797
Aaron was told to wire
250000$ offshore,

22:32.822 --> 22:35.424
then ask for a package
at the coat check.

22:35.449 --> 22:37.561
They handed him a wooden box
with the bottle inside.

22:37.586 --> 22:39.967
A priceless wine, one-of-its-kind,

22:39.992 --> 22:42.499
and the deal goes down at
an all-you-can-eat buffet?

22:42.524 --> 22:45.149
- Except it wasn't the Winston.
- Listen,

22:45.174 --> 22:47.024
the auction is in two
days and if we don't find

22:47.049 --> 22:48.977
- the real Winston, I...
- We'll look into it

22:49.002 --> 22:52.414
as soon as the restaurant opens.
Let's get back to the agency.

22:52.439 --> 22:55.799
- Yeah. I could use a drink.
- I'll check in with you later. OK?

22:58.461 --> 23:00.572
OK, enough with the pity party.

23:00.597 --> 23:02.753
We gotta get your mind off this.
What can I do?

23:02.778 --> 23:06.209
Distract me. Alright. Tell me about...

23:06.234 --> 23:09.121
you and the Shadow.

23:09.146 --> 23:11.449
Well, let's see. A couple of years ago,

23:11.474 --> 23:13.948
we ended up on the
same case and then...

23:14.036 --> 23:15.930
He just stuck around until...

23:15.955 --> 23:18.091
OK. Boring. Come on,
skip to the good stuff.

23:18.116 --> 23:20.036
- What's the good stuff?
- Like how is he in bed?

23:20.404 --> 23:22.464
- Come on!
- My God!

23:22.489 --> 23:25.009
- Are you kidding me right now?
- Wait. You two aren't together?

23:25.033 --> 23:27.496
- No! Of course not!
- You, my dear, are a sassy

23:27.521 --> 23:29.713
stone-cold catch and he,
from what I can tell,

23:29.738 --> 23:33.782
is a super hottie bad
boy modernman FILF.

23:33.806 --> 23:36.193
- Father I'd like to...
- No, I get it. I get it.

23:36.219 --> 23:39.557
Plus he knows vintages
like there's no tomorrow

23:39.710 --> 23:42.017
and, I mean, he's not afraid
to mix it up, you know,

23:42.042 --> 23:45.575
- when the going gets tough...
- Sounds like you're the one

23:45.600 --> 23:46.596
with the crush on him.

23:46.621 --> 23:47.543
- Me?
- Yeah.

23:47.568 --> 23:49.802
No! No, no, no. I would never do that.

23:49.827 --> 23:52.256
Really? Because if I seem to remember,

23:52.281 --> 23:55.541
back in the day, he was
exactly your type.

23:55.566 --> 23:57.790
You mean our type.

23:57.815 --> 23:59.851
I remember you liked to do it in places

23:59.876 --> 24:02.036
- where you would get caught.
- My God! Don't go there.

24:02.060 --> 24:04.214
Yes. Remember that one
time you snuck up

24:04.239 --> 24:06.389
to the roof of the science building

24:06.414 --> 24:09.552
- with James Montgomery?
- Our clothes blew off the roof.

24:09.577 --> 24:11.179
We got stuck up there for hours.

24:11.204 --> 24:14.295
Campus securituy had to rescue us.
My God!

24:15.002 --> 24:17.291
Honey, look, all I'm saying is...

24:17.676 --> 24:19.042
If I had somebody

24:19.067 --> 24:21.374
that looked at me the way
that Shade looks at you,

24:21.666 --> 24:23.664
I sure as hell wouldn't be sitting here

24:23.689 --> 24:26.341
getting drunk and talking
about the good old days.

24:30.161 --> 24:31.693
Hey, guys! Sorry I'm late.

24:31.718 --> 24:33.893
It's only three hours past dinnertime,

24:33.918 --> 24:35.192
what's another ten minutes?

24:35.217 --> 24:36.927
- Now, now.
- Grandpa's angry.

24:36.952 --> 24:39.630
No worries. I'll call Sal's.
I'll have a <igigante

24:39.655 --> 24:41.568
here in twenty minutes.

24:41.593 --> 24:42.994
- Jules already ordered.
- Yeah.

24:43.019 --> 24:45.652
We're having <icrostini
toscana, caprese salad,

24:45.677 --> 24:49.479
<ipappardelle alla leper and
<irisotto ai funghi. Delizioso.

24:49.504 --> 24:53.205
- Great. Let's eat.
- Seems Italy has introduced

24:53.230 --> 24:55.780
our little girl to a whole
new culinary world.

24:55.805 --> 24:58.157
Finally!

24:58.675 --> 25:01.282
Come to papa.

25:01.307 --> 25:05.168
But the <igigante is our thing, honey.
It's tradition.

25:05.193 --> 25:07.426
I thought we could
start a new tradition.

25:07.920 --> 25:10.039
Yeah, but that's the thing
about traditions, honey.

25:10.064 --> 25:12.064
They're not new, they're old.

25:12.089 --> 25:14.340
That's what makes them traditions.

25:15.304 --> 25:18.833
- A little help here, Dad?
- Sorry. You're on your own.

25:18.858 --> 25:21.286
- I'm starving.
- This <ipappardelle

25:21.310 --> 25:24.661
- looks gorgeous.
- Just try the <icrostini, OK?

25:24.687 --> 25:27.688
It's not the same without the
authentic Italian olive oil,

25:27.713 --> 25:29.693
- but still...
- Yeah, honey...

25:29.718 --> 25:33.653
It's not about the <icrostini.
I know what a <icrostini is.

25:37.078 --> 25:39.801
You know what? It looks delicious.
Let's eat.

25:39.826 --> 25:41.888
Yeah. Let's eat!

25:41.913 --> 25:44.210
I'm telling you, you're gonna love it.

25:46.871 --> 25:49.540
You had a standoff
with Jules over pizza?

25:49.565 --> 25:52.291
When you put it that
way, it sounds childish.

25:52.316 --> 25:54.852
Is there a way to put it where
it doesn't sound childish?

25:55.273 --> 25:57.921
She's growing up, Shade.
You gotta let her do that.

25:57.946 --> 26:00.303
I let her go to Italy!

26:00.328 --> 26:03.223
Yeah, but you expect her to
come back exactly the same way.

26:03.639 --> 26:05.550
Look, she's just
discovering other things

26:05.575 --> 26:07.783
that are important to her.
It's part of getting older.

26:07.925 --> 26:09.698
Why are you so wise this morning?

26:09.723 --> 26:12.283
You and Cassie solve the
world's problems last night?

26:12.581 --> 26:15.723
- Not exactly.
- What did you talk about?

26:16.350 --> 26:18.892
Look! We're at Chong's already.

26:25.082 --> 26:26.579
You know,

26:26.604 --> 26:28.948
the Internet will still be
there when your shift is over.

26:28.973 --> 26:30.453
It's live, genius. And I'll never get

26:30.477 --> 26:33.302
- to experience that moment again.
- Hey!

26:33.557 --> 26:36.390
- You know this guy?
- I remember he tipped me.

26:45.786 --> 26:47.634
He came in yesterday
with a claim check.

26:47.659 --> 26:49.659
Picked up a package.

26:52.010 --> 26:55.860
- Who dropped it off?
- Dropped what off?

26:56.122 --> 26:57.663
The package!

26:57.688 --> 26:59.278
Don't know. But I'm pretty sure

26:59.303 --> 27:01.606
it was right as we opened.
During the morning rush.

27:01.631 --> 27:03.878
You have a rush at 11am?

27:04.007 --> 27:07.239
If I open even one second late, the
people from Crestfield freak out.

27:07.333 --> 27:09.472
And you do not want
to tangle with them.

27:14.806 --> 27:16.590
Not quite what I expected.

27:16.623 --> 27:19.660
Try not to bump into anyone.
We can't afford the lawsuit.

27:19.685 --> 27:21.372
Here we are.

27:21.396 --> 27:24.264
- Nevin Ainslie, Room 453.
- Um...

27:24.289 --> 27:27.023
We said we were looking for
an old bottle of wine...

27:27.048 --> 27:28.639
The Winston '45?

27:28.664 --> 27:31.906
Say those magic words
and you'll never leave.

27:34.674 --> 27:38.380
I'm naked,

27:38.405 --> 27:41.796
but you're welcome to
whatever's left of me!

27:48.748 --> 27:51.160
You're not Nancy. Neither one of you.

27:51.185 --> 27:53.415
Thank goodness! No offence.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.664
We're private investigators.

27:55.689 --> 27:59.676
You're here about
the stolen scrapbook.

27:59.916 --> 28:03.017
No, sir, we're here
about a bottle of wine.

28:03.147 --> 28:06.120
- The Winston '45.
- Yeah, that's what I said.

28:06.154 --> 28:08.074
I don't think you understand.
We're talking about

28:08.098 --> 28:10.104
- a bottle of wine.
- So am I.

28:10.129 --> 28:13.292
- The Winston '45?
- Son...

28:13.317 --> 28:15.988
Which one of us use an hearing aid?

28:16.575 --> 28:18.106
I stand corrected.

28:18.131 --> 28:19.960
Please go on.

28:19.985 --> 28:22.826
Someone came through
here and grabbed it

28:22.851 --> 28:25.058
when I was out playing "Name That Tune"

28:25.083 --> 28:27.989
- in the third floor lounge.
- The wine?

28:28.014 --> 28:32.077
The scrapbook! My labels are in it.

28:34.637 --> 28:36.481
Sir Winston Churchill.

28:36.506 --> 28:38.453
The Bulldog himself.

28:43.021 --> 28:45.274
"Dear Nevin, thank you for
your heart of courage

28:45.299 --> 28:47.402
"and your wings of valour.

28:47.478 --> 28:50.770
"You will never be
forgotten." Signed W.C.

28:51.204 --> 28:53.116
You're the Spitfire pilot

28:53.141 --> 28:56.895
who flew the Winston '45
over the Channel on VE Day.

28:56.920 --> 29:00.315
Didn't even get to taste it.
I was just the courier.

29:00.340 --> 29:03.775
But Mr. Churchill had the
labels sent to me as a keepsake

29:03.800 --> 29:07.584
and I held onto them. Ever since.

29:07.777 --> 29:11.522
Until some arsehole stole them.

29:11.738 --> 29:14.507
Would you give us a
minute, please, sir?

29:14.532 --> 29:17.184
Yeah. Take all the time you want.

29:17.448 --> 29:20.195
If you see Nancy out there,
send her in, will you?

29:20.220 --> 29:22.076
Yeah.

29:22.390 --> 29:24.390
If he had five extra labels...

29:24.415 --> 29:26.295
That means there's five
extra bottles out there.

29:26.319 --> 29:29.734
And any one of them could
be the real Winston '45.

29:34.094 --> 29:38.207
So six bottles of Winston '45
were saved from the bombing.

29:38.480 --> 29:41.668
How did you end up with all
those dead soldiers, partner?

29:41.786 --> 29:44.395
We had a lot to talk about last night.

29:45.191 --> 29:46.779
After the war ended,

29:46.804 --> 29:49.428
Martin's grandfather sent five bottles

29:49.453 --> 29:51.408
- to Winston Churchill.
- Which were delivered

29:51.433 --> 29:54.284
by our Spitfire pilot, Nevin.

29:54.309 --> 29:56.265
Those bottles were
uncorked and finished

29:56.290 --> 29:58.190
- on VE Day.
- Except Nevin...

29:58.215 --> 30:00.948
kept the labels in a
scrapbook since then.

30:00.973 --> 30:03.815
And those labels were stolen
at roughly the same time

30:03.840 --> 30:05.719
as Martin's Winston.

30:05.744 --> 30:07.309
Why would somebody
steal the real bottle

30:07.334 --> 30:09.801
from Belanger Estates when
they could just make fakes

30:09.826 --> 30:12.966
- from the labels and avoid the risk?
- To authenticate them.

30:13.182 --> 30:16.495
You need to create the illusion
the original is up for grabs.

30:16.520 --> 30:19.533
- It's the Mona Lisa heist.
- What's the Mona Lisa heist?

30:19.558 --> 30:22.585
It's the case that made
Angie want to become a PI.

30:22.998 --> 30:24.964
1911. Paris.

30:24.989 --> 30:27.352
The Mona Lisa, the most
famous painting in the world,

30:27.377 --> 30:29.535
was stolen from the Louvre.
The thief made

30:29.560 --> 30:32.299
six flawless forgeries to
sell on the black market.

30:32.324 --> 30:33.973
So he could make six times the profit.

30:33.998 --> 30:34.638
Right.

30:34.663 --> 30:36.696
Knowing that none of the
buyers would ever admit

30:36.721 --> 30:39.877
- to having bought a stolen painting.
- So we need to track down

30:39.902 --> 30:44.204
- the other Winston '45 buyers.
- Cassie has a list of 60 names.

30:44.229 --> 30:46.653
What about reserve bids? If
the buyers were serious...

30:46.678 --> 30:47.798
They'd make a reserve bid...

30:47.822 --> 30:49.485
And those bids would
be secured by a bank.

30:49.510 --> 30:51.501
How many of those were there?

30:52.322 --> 30:54.490
- Now I speak?
- You speak.

30:54.515 --> 30:57.182
We had almost twenty bidders
and they pulled their bids

30:57.207 --> 30:59.521
when the news broke that
the Winston was gone.

31:00.824 --> 31:03.376
You're biting your lip.
You've got something.

31:03.401 --> 31:05.587
Well... What if we look
at the reserve bids

31:05.612 --> 31:08.735
that were pulled before the news
of the missing Winston broke?

31:08.760 --> 31:11.461
I'm gonna bet there's
Aaron's plus four more.

31:12.271 --> 31:13.877
Grab a seat.

31:13.902 --> 31:15.342
Keep the attitude, have a seat here.

31:15.366 --> 31:17.512
We'll get you back to the
spa in no time, alright?

31:20.333 --> 31:23.358
Well, that makes all of them.

31:23.383 --> 31:26.939
- Four fake Winstons.
- And Brisbane's makes five.

31:26.964 --> 31:29.849
All with machine-blown glass
and freshly glued labels.

31:29.874 --> 31:32.479
Which means none of them
is the real Winston '45.

31:33.014 --> 31:34.817
What did our buyers have to say?

31:34.842 --> 31:36.419
They're all singing the same tune.

31:36.444 --> 31:38.721
Contacted anonymously,
assured they were getting

31:38.746 --> 31:41.521
the real Winston,
transfered 250 G's offshore

31:41.546 --> 31:43.192
and went to pick up their bottle.

31:43.217 --> 31:45.150
- Never from the same location.
- No.

31:45.175 --> 31:46.975
Makes sense. You don't
want the buyers running

31:46.999 --> 31:49.894
into each other. Let's run
through the drop points.

31:49.959 --> 31:52.775
OK. We got Chong's Chinese Palace

31:52.800 --> 31:55.541
and Rona Jean's Silver Moon Salon.

31:55.937 --> 31:59.071
Glen Manor Bingo Hall.
The public library.

31:59.096 --> 32:01.646
Century Club Aquafit.
Who are we after here?

32:01.671 --> 32:03.723
- Granny Oakley?
- Do you see it?

32:03.748 --> 32:07.187
- What are we looking at?
- Smack-dab in the middle...

32:07.328 --> 32:09.829
Crestfield Gardens retirement home.

32:15.251 --> 32:16.585
Hi.

32:16.610 --> 32:18.246
The shuttle driver said only one person

32:18.271 --> 32:21.116
visited all the drop sites.
Nancy Colgate.

32:21.245 --> 32:23.463
- Fourth door on the right.
- Do we really believe

32:23.488 --> 32:26.793
that an octogenarian heisted
the priceless Winston '45?

32:26.818 --> 32:28.424
I guess we're about to find out.

32:28.449 --> 32:33.239
Good afternoon, ma'am.

32:33.264 --> 32:34.773
We're questioning all the residents

32:34.798 --> 32:36.948
here at Crestfield to see
if their experience...

32:36.973 --> 32:39.889
Sssh! Sssssh! Get in here,

32:39.914 --> 32:42.317
- both of you.
- OK...

32:46.450 --> 32:48.990
- What have you got?
- I beg your pardon?

32:49.015 --> 32:50.912
Nevin told me everything.

32:51.135 --> 32:53.161
It would mean the world
to him if you could

32:53.186 --> 32:55.887
- get those labels back.
- Um...

32:55.912 --> 32:59.213
- I don't understand.
- I'm Nancy.

32:59.918 --> 33:01.775
Nevin and I are...

33:03.332 --> 33:05.427
That Nancy. Yes.

33:06.075 --> 33:08.905
Wait a minute. If you two are so close,

33:08.930 --> 33:11.040
then why did you help steal his labels?

33:11.202 --> 33:14.166
- What are you talking about?
- Well...

33:15.302 --> 33:17.583
We know you made deliveries
to these five locations.

33:17.607 --> 33:22.012
Sure. I did. As a favor
to my granddaughter.

33:22.733 --> 33:25.915
What does this have to
do with Nevin's labels?

33:25.940 --> 33:28.093
You didn't look inside the packages?

33:28.118 --> 33:30.785
No. Why would I?

33:37.801 --> 33:41.167
Why are you looking in my fridge?

33:46.072 --> 33:50.718
My granddaughter gave me that one.
She's a wine expert.

33:54.283 --> 33:56.596
Would you happen to have a photograph

33:56.621 --> 33:59.692
- of your granddaughter?
- Of course I do!

34:04.652 --> 34:08.106
- Shade.
- Simone is amazing.

34:08.245 --> 34:11.268
She knows everything about wine.

34:21.192 --> 34:23.818
So that's lot 34.

34:25.221 --> 34:27.418
Hey, Simone. You got a minute?

34:27.879 --> 34:29.955
Does it look like I've got a minute?

34:29.980 --> 34:32.202
The auction is about to
begin in a few hours

34:32.226 --> 34:34.007
and we've had to pull 50 extra bottles

34:34.033 --> 34:36.627
out of the wine cellar to try to
make up for the lost Winston.

34:36.652 --> 34:38.261
Actually, that's why we're here.

34:38.286 --> 34:41.023
We may have some good news.

34:41.667 --> 34:45.301
- Is that...?
- The Winston '45.

34:45.542 --> 34:47.888
At least, we think it is.

34:47.922 --> 34:49.996
We need your help to authenticate it.

34:50.022 --> 34:53.333
Because if you say it's
real, then it is, right?

34:57.307 --> 34:58.800
So?

34:58.825 --> 35:00.459
Is it real?

35:00.484 --> 35:03.353
Is it the last of its
kind in existence?

35:03.378 --> 35:06.781
Yes. It's incredible. You found it!

35:06.806 --> 35:09.964
- Are you sure?
- I'd stake my reputation on it.

35:09.989 --> 35:12.766
- Um.
- What about this one?

35:14.294 --> 35:16.528
Is this one the last
of its kind as well?

35:16.553 --> 35:18.345
Or...

35:20.931 --> 35:22.853
What about this one?

35:23.879 --> 35:27.701
Or... This one?

35:28.104 --> 35:30.586
They seem to be multiplying.

35:32.165 --> 35:34.209
I don't understand any of this.

35:34.234 --> 35:37.547
I get it, Simone. You put your
stamp on thousands of bottles

35:37.572 --> 35:39.012
for the rich and ignorant and you...

35:39.036 --> 35:41.630
never reap the bounty. So you
stole the Holy Grail of wines

35:41.655 --> 35:43.614
and then leaked the story to the press.

35:43.639 --> 35:44.677
Which was all the proof

35:44.702 --> 35:47.536
your buyers needed that you
had the real Winston '45.

35:47.561 --> 35:49.761
Then, you played on their greed
and sold them all fakes.

35:49.785 --> 35:52.121
But to use your own
grandma as a wine mule?

35:52.146 --> 35:54.683
That's a whole new level of tasteless.

35:55.508 --> 35:57.718
You can't link any of this to me.

35:58.819 --> 36:00.259
And the only thing a jury

36:00.284 --> 36:02.639
would convict my grandmother
of is a bad palate.

36:06.427 --> 36:08.461
Maybe she's right, guys.

36:08.486 --> 36:12.288
I guess the only thing left
to do not is... drink.

36:18.346 --> 36:22.436
Your grandmother was kind
enough to give us this bottle.

36:24.215 --> 36:28.122
- Care to join us?
- I probably shouldn't.

36:28.147 --> 36:31.447
Hey, do you have a corkscrew?

36:31.472 --> 36:34.348
- There must be one around here.
- My God!

36:34.647 --> 36:38.623
What have you done? The Winston '45!

36:38.890 --> 36:41.528
You have no idea what I went through

36:41.553 --> 36:44.957
to keep this safe! It was the last one.

36:45.240 --> 36:47.607
And now it's gone.

36:50.218 --> 36:53.757
Shadow Vintage. 100% grape juice.

36:53.782 --> 36:55.868
Only the thief would know
the real Winston '45

36:55.893 --> 36:59.184
- was under that label.
- Now everyone else does too.

36:59.363 --> 37:02.109
Martin loaned us an old
bottle out of his cellar.

37:02.134 --> 37:05.430
Less than 10$.
But seeing the expression

37:05.455 --> 37:08.650
on your face when that bottle
hit the ground... Priceless.

37:23.352 --> 37:26.409
The one and only Winston '45.

37:26.698 --> 37:28.975
There's still time to
get it in the auction.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.160
The bidding may be even higher
after the adventure it's been on.

37:34.944 --> 37:37.072
This doesn't belong in an auction.

37:38.061 --> 37:41.201
So are you putting it
back in the cellar?

37:41.784 --> 37:44.357
No, it doesn't belong
in a cellar, either.

37:44.967 --> 37:47.191
Not something this beautiful.

37:47.216 --> 37:49.861
So... what are you gonna do?

37:51.402 --> 37:53.841
I need to ask you a favor, Shadow.

37:56.176 --> 37:58.139
It's open.

37:59.896 --> 38:01.839
Nevin?

38:01.864 --> 38:05.291
Finally. Did you find my labels?

38:05.499 --> 38:08.219
They're a little the
worse for wear, but yes.

38:08.351 --> 38:09.976
Fantastic!

38:10.001 --> 38:12.296
I thought they'd be gone forever.

38:13.340 --> 38:14.892
Would a 50 do?

38:14.916 --> 38:17.608
It's on the house.

38:18.048 --> 38:20.850
You need something like
this at my age to...

38:22.056 --> 38:24.041
remember who you were.

38:24.066 --> 38:25.997
About that. There's...

38:26.022 --> 38:28.443
There's actually someone
here who'd like to meet you.

38:29.356 --> 38:31.164
Mr. Ainslie?

38:32.163 --> 38:34.374
My name is Martin Belanger.

38:34.535 --> 38:36.119
I think you knew my grandfather.

38:36.144 --> 38:38.261
My goodness!

38:38.864 --> 38:40.552
He was a good man.

38:40.577 --> 38:44.393
I would be honored if you
would tell me about him

38:44.418 --> 38:46.597
over a drink.

38:47.518 --> 38:50.614
- Is... is that...?
- The Winston '45.

38:50.639 --> 38:52.527
Last of its kind.

38:53.523 --> 38:56.501
I'd never thought I'd ever
be able to taste this.

38:56.526 --> 38:59.735
Sit... sit down. Sit down, everybody.

39:01.056 --> 39:03.109
I think it might be wasted on me.

39:03.134 --> 39:05.372
You may be surprised.

39:15.146 --> 39:18.630
- To seizing the day!
- Whenever it may come.

39:45.532 --> 39:48.634
- Hey! Bad time?
- For you? Never.

39:49.024 --> 39:51.191
I came to give you this.

39:51.216 --> 39:52.685
I feel weird taking money from you.

39:52.710 --> 39:54.244
No! Martin covered half your fee

39:54.269 --> 39:56.812
and my company was so over
the moon about the auction,

39:56.837 --> 40:00.365
minus the Winston '45, that
they picked up the rest.

40:00.390 --> 40:02.337
Really? Then I will take that.

40:02.934 --> 40:04.742
This, however...

40:04.939 --> 40:06.734
This is from me.

40:06.759 --> 40:08.617
It's an Henri Lepagnier.

40:08.642 --> 40:11.025
Open it in a year.
It'll blow your mind.

40:11.050 --> 40:13.535
Only if you come back
and drink it with me.

40:13.560 --> 40:16.394
You know what? I don't
know where I'll be.

40:16.606 --> 40:18.657
I gave my two-week notice.

40:18.682 --> 40:21.005
What? You love that job!

40:21.030 --> 40:22.578
I thought I did.

40:22.603 --> 40:24.915
But after working with you
and Shade, I realized

40:24.940 --> 40:26.985
that I was just collecting commissions

40:27.010 --> 40:30.050
on other people's passions,
you know, not my own.

40:30.480 --> 40:32.199
So what's next?

40:32.224 --> 40:33.710
I don't know.

40:33.735 --> 40:37.067
Maybe a wine apprenticeship
in the Rhone Valley.

40:37.092 --> 40:39.623
Somebody in college told
me the key to happiness

40:39.648 --> 40:41.122
- was freedom.
- Ha! Ha! Ha!

40:41.147 --> 40:43.774
- That was a long time ago.
- So, what happened?

40:44.246 --> 40:46.265
Really, what happened? Did you grow up?

40:46.290 --> 40:48.009
You got cautious?

40:48.034 --> 40:50.157
You lose your sense of spontaneity?

40:50.182 --> 40:52.816
Geez, just call me boring
and get it over with.

40:52.841 --> 40:55.138
You're far from boring, Ange.

40:55.863 --> 40:59.141
But maybe I was wrong.
You have changed.

40:59.869 --> 41:02.605
Come on, you used to go
after what you wanted.

41:02.630 --> 41:04.615
Just saying...

41:04.754 --> 41:06.785
Here. Come here.

41:08.115 --> 41:11.395
One year. OK?

41:11.420 --> 41:13.654
Somebody special.

41:24.829 --> 41:27.106
I thought Mom was picking me up.

41:27.131 --> 41:29.907
I was in the neighbourhood,
so I figured I'd swing by.

41:30.051 --> 41:31.813
You don't mind, do you?

41:31.838 --> 41:34.144
No. No, of course not.

41:35.143 --> 41:37.290
Look, Dad, I'm sorry
about the other day.

41:37.604 --> 41:39.702
I didn't mean to mess with
our family tradition or...

41:39.727 --> 41:41.489
Honey, that wasn't your fault.

41:41.514 --> 41:44.377
I got hung up on something
that didn't matter.

41:44.746 --> 41:46.320
Hey, I...

41:46.345 --> 41:48.137
I got you something.

41:48.655 --> 41:50.344
Here you go.

41:56.381 --> 41:57.781
What is it?

41:57.806 --> 42:00.530
It's Rossi, the best
olive oil on the market.

42:00.555 --> 42:02.653
For the next time we order from Sal's.

42:02.678 --> 42:05.942
Dad, thank you!

42:07.175 --> 42:09.077
I guess...

42:09.944 --> 42:13.094
Part of me wants you to stay
a 12-years-old girl forever.

42:13.412 --> 42:16.000
Dad... I'll always be your little girl.

42:19.131 --> 42:22.233
- I miss Italy.
- Yeah, I know you do, honey.

42:22.258 --> 42:26.255
That's why I've got one more
little surprise for you.

42:28.731 --> 42:30.372
Where are we going?

42:30.397 --> 42:33.497
Almost there, honey.
Just a few more steps.

42:34.795 --> 42:37.747
And here she is! Our guest of honor!

42:37.772 --> 42:39.568
- Hey, Jules.
- Hi, sweetie.

42:39.592 --> 42:41.131
- Wow, everybody's here.
- Hello.

42:41.156 --> 42:42.177
Hello.

42:42.202 --> 42:44.008
- Have a seat, miss.
- Thank you.

42:44.305 --> 42:45.983
It's not quite Italy, honey,

42:46.008 --> 42:47.953
but it's as close as I could get.

42:47.978 --> 42:50.656
- It's perfect, Dad.
- Now, you get to be the first

42:50.681 --> 42:53.023
- to try our most recent vintage.
- Um...

42:53.048 --> 42:56.904
- Relax, Shadow.
- When in Rome...

42:57.160 --> 42:59.777
Right on.

43:00.556 --> 43:03.121
- Thank you.
- A toast.

43:03.146 --> 43:06.181
To traditions, new and old.

43:06.206 --> 43:08.529
Wouldn't you rather have a beer?

43:08.554 --> 43:11.236
No! I've... I've learned a few things

43:11.261 --> 43:14.808
in the last couple of days. About wine.

43:15.516 --> 43:17.017
To another great case.

43:17.058 --> 43:19.373
Solved by two brilliant detectives.

43:22.877 --> 43:26.341
- Wait!
- Gotcha.
