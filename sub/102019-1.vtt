WEBVTT

01:09.736 --> 01:12.072
Come on, here we go.

01:14.449 --> 01:15.742
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:19.079 --> 01:19.913
Woo-hoo!

01:20.914 --> 01:21.748
Woo-hoo!

01:35.596 --> 01:38.473
Your boy gives 110%
of everything he does.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.309
I don't need to
tell you what a spot

01:40.434 --> 01:42.644
on the Yankees AA club
would mean for Jackson.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.479
Nope, no, no.

01:44.605 --> 01:45.647
We are very well aware.

01:50.777 --> 01:51.778
Woo!

01:56.825 --> 01:57.659
Woo!

02:07.628 --> 02:08.461
Ya-hoo!

02:28.315 --> 02:30.692
- Whoa, here boy!
- There you go, Jackson.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.361
Just like old times.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.157
Goddammit, Lucas!

02:38.825 --> 02:40.661
Hey, come on, come on, come on!

02:40.702 --> 02:41.537
Let's get him!

02:41.662 --> 02:43.664
Let's get him, Sundance!

02:44.706 --> 02:45.666
Woohoo!

02:45.749 --> 02:46.583
What the heck?

02:46.667 --> 02:47.835
Hey man.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.253
Been waiting so long,

02:49.336 --> 02:51.171
thought I'd take a
swim over to Mexico.

02:51.213 --> 02:52.589
You cut me off.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.383
It ain't my fault
Rooster's a faster horse.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.592
Yeah right.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.845
You had him and he
knows it, Sundance.

02:57.886 --> 03:01.390
All right big brother, double
or nothing back to the house.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.349
Woo!

03:10.524 --> 03:11.733
Eat my dust, boy!

03:14.403 --> 03:16.697
So you're really
staying here all summer?

03:16.738 --> 03:19.116
Couldn't wait to get home
and shovel shit with you.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.243
Come on, you know you can't
run this place without me.

03:21.368 --> 03:24.288
I just figured you'd be
off training somewhere.

03:24.371 --> 03:27.875
Got the big Yankees tryout
next week, better be ready.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.543
Rather train with you.

03:29.585 --> 03:31.128
Good luck telling mom that.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.881
She won't shut up about it.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.883
Oh, my baby in New York.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.762
Boy's going all the way.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.764
Hammers the plate in.

03:42.890 --> 03:46.143
When you go into the Yanks
system, you're set for life.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.730
Come on man, it takes
years to make it to the bigs.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.315
We've got so much to do
right here, right pop?

03:51.398 --> 03:54.109
Well you don't want
trade that for this.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.279
Come on, dang piece of crap.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.322
Dad.

03:58.405 --> 03:59.281
What?

03:59.406 --> 04:01.825
Come on, use my computer.

04:01.909 --> 04:04.786
Set up a spreadsheet on Excel.

04:04.912 --> 04:05.746
I'll tell you something,

04:05.787 --> 04:08.415
why don't you just
worry about that arm?

04:08.457 --> 04:09.833
Dad, I like the ranch.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.084
Well, then when you get
your big signing bonus

04:11.126 --> 04:13.795
from the New York Yankees
you can pay off our mortgage.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.255
Right darlin'?

04:21.470 --> 04:22.304
Oh shit.

04:22.429 --> 04:23.597
What is that?

04:25.474 --> 04:26.808
Stay here.

04:26.934 --> 04:27.935
Just stay here.

04:34.608 --> 04:35.442
No way.

04:40.614 --> 04:41.448
Jackson.

04:42.950 --> 04:43.825
Jackson.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.827
I'm going mom.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.172
Hey dad,
they cut the fence!

04:57.297 --> 04:59.341
Dad!
You seeing this?

04:59.466 --> 05:01.844
Keep them away from
the house!

05:01.969 --> 05:03.804
Get out of here!

05:03.846 --> 05:04.721
Go on, git!

05:04.805 --> 05:05.973
Get the hell outta here!

05:06.014 --> 05:07.015
Git!

05:09.977 --> 05:12.479
Get the hell off our land!

05:12.521 --> 05:14.898
- Go on, get outta here!
- Go back in the house.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.358
Go on.

05:16.483 --> 05:17.317
Go on.

05:18.861 --> 05:20.529
- Dad, you all right?
- Yup.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.534
Whoa, whoa, Sundance.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.911
Whoa Sundance, it's okay.

05:27.995 --> 05:28.996
Whoa, Sunny.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.386
Jackson!

05:44.511 --> 05:45.929
You seen anybody in here?

05:46.013 --> 05:47.347
No.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.019
Shit!

05:52.060 --> 05:55.272
God damn cattle are everywhere!

05:55.355 --> 05:57.900
Dad, you going after them?

05:58.025 --> 06:00.235
I'm coming with you.

06:20.923 --> 06:22.049
You're up early.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.260
How'd it go?

06:25.385 --> 06:26.595
Got a couple.

06:27.721 --> 06:31.058
Dad's handing them
over to border patrol.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.063
How's it feel
when you catch them?

06:36.104 --> 06:40.567
Remember we used to go
fishing out at Robbins Pond?

06:41.735 --> 06:42.569
Yeah?

06:43.946 --> 06:46.990
Remember how I used to
always catch that same bass?

06:47.074 --> 06:48.951
Over and over again.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.118
Sure, it was
catch and release.

06:50.244 --> 06:51.912
Right right right.

06:51.954 --> 06:53.622
But you think that after
getting the hook in them

06:53.747 --> 06:55.415
and ripping themselves
up all bloody

06:55.457 --> 06:57.626
that the fish would wise up.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.087
But they just kept
coming on back.

07:00.128 --> 07:00.963
You know why?

07:02.965 --> 07:04.591
Why?

07:04.633 --> 07:06.635
'Cause they're hungry.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.953
It's like Dad
said it would be... just great!

07:33.662 --> 07:36.456
He never said it
would be this cold.

07:36.540 --> 07:40.627
I never knew my grandkids
could be so whiny.

07:40.711 --> 07:42.796
Silly little boys!

07:42.838 --> 07:45.174
Dad said we
should wait for him here.

07:45.215 --> 07:48.010
Doesn't matter. He's not
"The Shepherd" anymore.

07:48.051 --> 07:49.887
We need a real coyote.

07:49.970 --> 07:56.351
Real coyotes will rob you
and leave you to die.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.688
Shut up and sit down.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.690
I'll be right back.

08:44.274 --> 08:45.734
How much?

08:45.943 --> 08:47.528
35 for the rabbit.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.113
20 for the fruit and
20 for the water.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.408
Dad said we shouldn't
buy anything here.

08:54.076 --> 08:56.078
You'll need more than agua,

09:04.211 --> 09:05.712
Check this out.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.885
You can drill those Texans
a new asshole with this.

09:11.969 --> 09:13.929
How much for that?

09:14.054 --> 09:15.764
I can loan it to you.

09:16.932 --> 09:20.060
Then maybe you help me
out out there, you know.

09:20.102 --> 09:23.939
Just have to carry one
of those with you, huh.

09:25.607 --> 09:26.608
So?

09:29.111 --> 09:30.737
Enrique!

09:30.779 --> 09:31.613
Ah shit.

09:32.906 --> 09:33.740
Papa?

09:33.824 --> 09:34.908
The Shepherd!

09:36.243 --> 09:37.244
Damn ninos, why
didn't you tell me

09:37.286 --> 09:39.246
you was with the Shepherd?

09:41.498 --> 09:44.585
But Gustavo, we need it
to defend against the Minutemen.

09:46.753 --> 09:49.756
A bunch of fat guys
drinking beer in lawn chairs?

09:50.090 --> 09:51.675
What a joke!

09:57.139 --> 10:00.851
Your pops helped me
cross when I was your age.

10:00.934 --> 10:05.606
Said he'd protect me and my
mama, get us a better life.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.817
It's kind of funny
you know 'cause,

10:08.942 --> 10:12.946
I don't really remember
you after that, Gustavo.

10:15.616 --> 10:16.700
We do the same thing, padre.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.785
We can even do it,.

10:19.870 --> 10:22.122
I do it for the church.

10:23.332 --> 10:28.795
So that no coyote
can mess with my people.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.052
See you on the other
side, Shepherd!

10:45.145 --> 10:47.356
Put that dirt in the back.

10:47.481 --> 10:48.982
Watch your hand.

10:50.484 --> 10:53.654
You put your hand there
again I'm gonna hit it.

10:53.695 --> 10:54.696
All right.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.874
How many you think we lost?

11:05.999 --> 11:08.669
Counted about 10 this morning.

11:09.670 --> 11:10.671
10.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.173
Prime heifers.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.676
Two grand a head.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.222
What you want to do, dad?

11:25.352 --> 11:27.896
We're going to Mexico
and get our property back.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.857
That's what I'm gonna do.

11:29.898 --> 11:32.276
Ooh, that's what
I'm talking about.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.193
Not you.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.237
Just me and Lucas.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.196
Come on dad, it's
gonna be dark out there.

11:36.238 --> 11:37.364
Not you.

11:37.406 --> 11:38.240
What, you're
gonna need my help.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.366
I said, ah!

11:43.704 --> 11:44.705
God!

11:45.372 --> 11:46.748
You all right?

11:46.874 --> 11:50.377
Yeah, I'm okay, I'm
just sick of this shit.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.256
Grab that real quick.

11:54.381 --> 12:00.012
Jackson, Lucas, keep working.

12:01.889 --> 12:03.390
You gonna leave
me here? All right.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.935
Y'all hear
about them coyotes in Laredo?

12:07.060 --> 12:08.395
No, what happened?

12:08.437 --> 12:09.271
Well they've
been poisoning ranch dogs

12:09.396 --> 12:11.273
to shut them up when they cross.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.275
Oh man,
that, that's not gonna work.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.277
I'll be ready with a load
of buckshot for them beaners

12:15.402 --> 12:17.404
they try that bullshit...

12:24.077 --> 12:25.746
Move on, let's go.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.414
Let's go.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.418
Listen to me.

12:33.086 --> 12:36.256
Me and your mom, we're
trapped here, we're stuck.

12:36.298 --> 12:38.675
Not you, you got
college, baseball.

12:38.759 --> 12:39.760
You have a gift.

12:39.801 --> 12:41.428
I like ranching.

12:41.470 --> 12:42.304
Ranching.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.680
Don't know if you notice

12:43.764 --> 12:45.349
but we're on the wrong
side of the fence.

12:45.432 --> 12:49.186
I don't know how long
we're gonna have a ranch.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.647
And all you want to talk
to me about is baseball.

12:51.772 --> 12:54.775
- Who gives a shit?
- Hey hey hey, language.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.446
You gonna give it a shot.

12:59.488 --> 13:00.948
You knock them Yankees
on their asses.

13:00.989 --> 13:03.283
It don't work out,
don't work out.

13:03.325 --> 13:04.785
Who gives a shit?

13:08.830 --> 13:11.959
Watch your language.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.836
Come on, Tanner.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.170
Bad enough I gotta
show my passport

13:15.295 --> 13:18.215
to go to the hardware store.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.174
Go ahead Mr Greer.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.300
Thank you.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.351
Here's the water, guys!

13:30.894 --> 13:32.396
Pass it around.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.654
Rest for a little.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.906
Come on, son.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.325
Let's climb up together.

13:45.409 --> 13:47.661
You'll see how beautiful it is.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.676
You see that hill over there?

14:04.011 --> 14:08.390
Well, a little bit
closer to us is Texas.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.685
Texas looks just like Mexico.

14:12.686 --> 14:16.190
Yeah, it really does.

14:18.275 --> 14:21.737
Will you still be
"The Shepherd" in Texas?

14:23.363 --> 14:26.450
Well, someone else has to do it.

14:29.912 --> 14:31.371
I missed you so much.

14:31.413 --> 14:32.915
Me too, son.

14:45.886 --> 14:48.472
We're gonna go get those
cows across the river.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.390
Be back by morning.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.570
Come help your momma out.

15:06.448 --> 15:07.282
Oh.

15:09.243 --> 15:10.452
This looks like fun.

15:18.085 --> 15:18.919
Ya ya!

15:18.961 --> 15:20.921
Come on fatty, come on!

15:23.423 --> 15:24.967
Getting back to cross.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.468
Still missing three.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.977
Dad, I can't see.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.651
Count to ten.

15:54.121 --> 15:55.873
How about now?

15:57.708 --> 15:58.959
Better.

15:59.042 --> 16:00.669
See? It's all good now.

16:01.378 --> 16:04.131
Sometimes you have to
close your eyes and start over

16:04.214 --> 16:07.134
to see things clearly.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.469
Let's go.

16:14.683 --> 16:16.977
Fernando, wait for me.

16:18.478 --> 16:21.148
I got a little gift for you.

16:26.695 --> 16:29.531
I'm gonna keep this forever.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.368
You're just like your mother.

16:33.493 --> 16:40.042
She used to keep every penny.
Always saving up.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.503
You remind me of
her in every way.

16:48.050 --> 16:49.426
What happened?

16:55.265 --> 16:57.684
That's what "real" coyotes do.

17:00.187 --> 17:02.898
Not like your father.

17:03.774 --> 17:06.193
Let's go, let's go. Keep moving.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.079
You know it's just
gonna get dirty again.

17:17.204 --> 17:18.288
Then I'll wash it again.

17:20.582 --> 17:22.917
Now there's your baseball smile.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.546
I've been missing that lately.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.590
This is our home, ma.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.718
I don't want to lose it.

17:33.220 --> 17:36.598
Saving the ranch
is not your job.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.725
Come on, you're
going to New York.

17:38.767 --> 17:40.727
Aren't you excited?

17:40.769 --> 17:42.396
Yeah.

17:42.437 --> 17:44.231
But you know AA pitchers,

17:44.273 --> 17:47.401
they throw an average
of like 92 MPH.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.613
Do you remember that
church league game?

17:51.738 --> 17:53.448
Y'all were getting whooped.

17:53.574 --> 17:56.243
Half of the parents
packed up by the fifth.

17:56.285 --> 17:59.746
Yeah the other half were yelling
to yank me off the mound.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.665
I didn't want to
make you more nervous,

18:01.748 --> 18:02.624
so I started waiting

18:02.749 --> 18:04.001
- from the snack bar.
- From the snack bar.

18:04.084 --> 18:04.918
Yes!

18:07.588 --> 18:11.091
The more they scored
the harder you threw.

18:14.261 --> 18:15.304
We lost that game.

18:15.429 --> 18:17.139
By one run.

18:17.264 --> 18:20.642
And I swear that kid,
he was out at the plate.

18:20.767 --> 18:21.643
- He was out.
- Yeah,

18:21.768 --> 18:23.478
that's what I said.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.274
The point is,

18:28.817 --> 18:31.111
you played it out, Jacks.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.614
You didn't give up.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.832
What, where are you going?

18:43.957 --> 18:45.834
Jacks, where are you going?

18:45.959 --> 18:48.629
Got me a game to finish.

19:07.689 --> 19:09.691
I'm
going to my friend's house.

19:15.656 --> 19:17.032
Let's do it one more time.

19:27.501 --> 19:29.670
If we go back now we look
like idiots, all right.

19:29.711 --> 19:31.880
We're not going back.

19:32.005 --> 19:33.715
Just gotta find...

19:33.841 --> 19:34.758
Ya!

19:41.765 --> 19:42.599
Don't move!

19:42.683 --> 19:43.559
Don't move.

19:43.684 --> 19:45.394
Hey dad, I got three
of them over there.

19:45.519 --> 19:47.354
Hey man, we want no trouble.

19:47.396 --> 19:48.355
Stop moving!

19:48.438 --> 19:49.731
- Miguel!
- Stay there, don't move.

19:49.857 --> 19:50.732
No, stay back, hey!

19:50.858 --> 19:52.401
- Back up!
- Take it easy.

19:52.526 --> 19:53.610
- Wait, wait.
- Don't you move.

19:53.694 --> 19:55.279
- Don't you move.
- We're passing by, man.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.905
Don't you move.
Get down.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.198
We want no trouble.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.074
I don't know what
she's saying, dad!

19:59.199 --> 20:00.200
What you want me to do?

20:00.242 --> 20:01.076
I got you, I got
you. Don't move.

20:01.201 --> 20:02.369
Don't you move.

20:02.411 --> 20:03.704
Down on your knees,
everybody down, down.

20:03.745 --> 20:05.247
Sir,
we're just passing by.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.748
You
down, down, get down.

20:06.874 --> 20:08.208
- You two, down.
- Take easy.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.209
Get back!

20:09.251 --> 20:11.587
Get back right now!

20:11.712 --> 20:12.546
Go on, back up!

20:12.588 --> 20:13.714
Get down on your knees, now!

20:13.755 --> 20:14.756
We
don't want trouble.

20:14.882 --> 20:16.592
I told you to sit
down. I said get back.

20:16.717 --> 20:17.759
- Don't move.
- Get down.

20:17.885 --> 20:18.886
Ya ya, ho!

20:19.720 --> 20:20.888
I said get down.

20:20.929 --> 20:21.930
Dad I'm here,
what do you need?

20:22.055 --> 20:23.932
Down down down,
I said get down.

20:24.057 --> 20:25.434
Keep your arms there.

20:25.559 --> 20:26.894
- Are you armed?
- No sir, no sir.

20:26.935 --> 20:27.769
- You sure.
- Yes.

20:27.895 --> 20:28.729
Dad!

20:28.770 --> 20:29.730
We want no trouble.

20:29.813 --> 20:30.647
I got you dad!

20:30.731 --> 20:32.399
- I'm here!
- Jack, what are you?

20:32.441 --> 20:33.775
Oh!

20:33.901 --> 20:36.904
We want no
trouble man.

20:37.905 --> 20:38.780
Dad.

20:38.906 --> 20:39.740
Dad move out of the way!

20:39.781 --> 20:41.158
Jackson!

20:41.241 --> 20:42.492
What the hell are
you doing here?

20:43.577 --> 20:44.912
No!

20:44.953 --> 20:45.787
Papa!

21:02.429 --> 21:03.639
Move!

21:03.764 --> 21:04.598
Fernando!

21:07.643 --> 21:08.477
Fernando!

21:18.320 --> 21:19.696
Get away.

21:19.780 --> 21:21.657
Get away Jackson.

21:21.782 --> 21:22.616
Dad.

21:24.618 --> 21:25.661
Luke!

21:25.786 --> 21:26.620
Luke!

21:27.371 --> 21:28.205
Luke!

21:28.288 --> 21:29.498
Lucas!

21:29.623 --> 21:30.832
Hey, hey!

21:30.958 --> 21:32.334
Let me see it, let me see.

21:32.459 --> 21:33.710
Oh Jesus.

21:33.794 --> 21:35.671
Fernando!

21:39.508 --> 21:40.342
What do I do?

21:40.467 --> 21:41.635
Tell me what you want me to do.

21:41.677 --> 21:42.511
Look
at me, look at me.

21:42.636 --> 21:43.470
Hold him, hold him!

21:43.512 --> 21:44.346
Okay okay okay.

21:52.813 --> 21:53.897
Stay
here, stay here.

21:53.981 --> 21:57.401
I got him, I got
him, I got him.

21:57.484 --> 21:58.360
Dad where are you going?

21:59.987 --> 22:00.821
Go!

22:00.863 --> 22:01.864
Move!

22:01.989 --> 22:02.823
Please.

22:02.865 --> 22:03.699
Policia.

22:03.824 --> 22:04.658
Go go.

22:05.701 --> 22:06.869
Come on man.

22:06.994 --> 22:08.871
- Please.
- Tell him to go.

22:08.996 --> 22:09.830
He's my son!

22:09.872 --> 22:11.999
Dad, what are you doing?

22:13.083 --> 22:13.917
Move.

22:14.001 --> 22:15.335
Please.

22:15.878 --> 22:18.881
I swear to God I'll kill him!

22:20.340 --> 22:22.885
- He's my son!
- Policia, go!

22:23.010 --> 22:24.553
My son!

22:26.680 --> 22:29.850
Dad!

22:32.853 --> 22:33.729
Dad.

22:37.941 --> 22:40.360
Hey, hey. The cops are here.

22:47.868 --> 22:49.578
They're
gonna help you, hang on.

22:49.703 --> 22:51.371
Hey, we need help!

22:52.539 --> 22:54.374
- We need help!
- Help!

22:54.416 --> 22:55.626
Freeze!

22:55.709 --> 22:57.044
- Don't shoot me.
- Don't shoot him.

22:57.085 --> 22:57.961
- Don't move.
- It's my son.

22:58.045 --> 23:00.589
We need help.

23:00.714 --> 23:02.758
So this coyote just
pulls a knife and stabs you.

23:02.883 --> 23:03.967
Right.

23:04.051 --> 23:04.927
And then y'all started
fighting for the rifle.

23:05.052 --> 23:06.595
Right.

23:06.720 --> 23:07.763
He stabbed me here.

23:07.888 --> 23:09.097
Yup.

23:09.223 --> 23:11.558
He grabbed my rifle and,

23:12.559 --> 23:13.936
and we were
struggling for a bit.

23:14.061 --> 23:17.731
He got the best of me,
he did knock me down.

23:21.568 --> 23:24.738
My boy Lucas was on
the other side and,

23:26.406 --> 23:28.909
he took a shot and he hit him.

23:33.789 --> 23:35.958
And then he turned around on me

23:36.083 --> 23:38.836
and uh, I had run back to my
horse to grab my bolt action

23:38.919 --> 23:42.089
and, that's when the little
boy jumped in front of me.

23:42.172 --> 23:43.006
Mm-hm, mm-hm.

23:43.090 --> 23:44.758
And I shot him.

23:49.638 --> 23:52.808
Makes me sick that
this kid lost his life

23:52.933 --> 23:54.643
for the sins of this coyote.

23:54.768 --> 23:56.478
What did I do, God?

23:57.938 --> 24:00.148
I got narcos and smugglers
on my property every dang day.

24:00.274 --> 24:01.942
Every dang day.

24:01.984 --> 24:02.818
I know you know that.

24:02.943 --> 24:04.319
Mm-hm.

24:04.444 --> 24:05.946
And if I gotta take,

24:05.988 --> 24:06.822
take this into my own hands

24:06.947 --> 24:08.949
to keep it in check
then so be it.

24:08.991 --> 24:10.450
I understand.

24:13.120 --> 24:16.039
So, um, basically
what you're saying

24:16.123 --> 24:18.792
is that it was all self defense.

24:20.836 --> 24:24.464
It's not basically,
it's self defense.

24:25.632 --> 24:29.553
Yeah, a lot of wet cattle
roaming around when I got there.

24:29.636 --> 24:33.473
Never seen steer move
towards gunfire before.

24:37.019 --> 24:40.814
You know my boy is laying
in there clinging to his life.

24:40.856 --> 24:42.024
Maybe it's time I go
sit with my wife now.

24:42.149 --> 24:43.817
We're almost done sir.

24:43.859 --> 24:45.152
We're almost done.

24:45.194 --> 24:47.070
Now what were y'all
doing out there so late?

24:47.154 --> 24:49.072
Some kind of minute
man thing there, son?

24:49.156 --> 24:50.532
We take good
care of our family.

24:50.657 --> 24:52.075
It's just something
you do, you know?

24:52.159 --> 24:55.579
Well this boy you
shot, he has family too.

24:55.662 --> 24:57.497
It was an accident.

25:00.167 --> 25:01.376
That how you saw it?

25:01.502 --> 25:03.420
It was hectic out there, son.

25:03.504 --> 25:04.922
Self defense.

25:05.005 --> 25:06.673
Just like my dad said.

25:06.715 --> 25:08.008
Y'all couldn't
just run them off?

25:08.050 --> 25:09.092
We tried.

25:09.176 --> 25:12.095
We don't speak Spanish,
Officer Ramirez.

25:12.179 --> 25:16.391
I don't speak Spanish
either sir, and it's Ranger.

25:16.517 --> 25:19.102
You work horses, Ranger?

25:19.186 --> 25:21.688
No sir, I never have.

25:21.730 --> 25:23.440
You learn early on not
to walk behind horses

25:23.524 --> 25:26.068
'cause they kick
you in the head.

25:26.193 --> 25:27.945
You see, long time ago

25:28.028 --> 25:30.614
they used to be chased
down by wolves, so,

25:30.697 --> 25:33.075
as time went on they stopped
looking what was back there,

25:33.200 --> 25:34.201
they just kick.

25:36.036 --> 25:38.539
I'll have to remember that.

25:40.040 --> 25:42.709
Now don't leave town, Mr Greer.

25:46.213 --> 25:49.633
Don't
leave town, Mr Greer.

25:49.716 --> 25:51.093
All stick together.

25:53.053 --> 25:55.264
Let's go see your mother.

25:55.389 --> 25:57.099
Dad, you and Lucas
didn't do anything...

25:57.224 --> 25:58.892
I fired the shot.

26:00.269 --> 26:01.770
You hear me boy?

26:02.729 --> 26:04.064
I took the shot.

26:08.110 --> 26:09.778
You took the shot.

26:11.113 --> 26:12.072
Yes sir.

26:36.430 --> 26:39.975
Shall we go to the church, son?

26:48.609 --> 26:51.445
Aren't you going to talk to me?

26:55.616 --> 26:59.286
Talk to me. Don't
hold it inside.

27:02.539 --> 27:05.542
Gustavo, you're a man of faith.

27:14.968 --> 27:16.803
I'm nothing.

27:20.682 --> 27:22.809
I'm not a husband.

27:25.187 --> 27:27.064
I'm not a father.

27:30.484 --> 27:32.486
I'm nothing.

27:37.491 --> 27:40.160
Fernando is with his mother now.

27:42.538 --> 27:44.540
They're happy...

27:44.998 --> 27:47.543
They're not suffering anymore.

27:49.002 --> 27:51.255
Let's go pray.

27:53.423 --> 27:57.052
Don't turn your back on God.

28:00.180 --> 28:03.016
Who turned their back on whom?

28:04.685 --> 28:06.895
I always followed him

28:08.188 --> 28:09.898
and adored him.

28:10.732 --> 28:12.609
Now look what that asshole did!

28:19.950 --> 28:23.412
Forgive me, son. Forgive me!

29:49.289 --> 29:51.291
My dad didn't do nothing.

29:52.334 --> 29:53.293
I know.

29:55.462 --> 29:56.964
This ain't fair.

29:58.465 --> 29:59.967
They were on our land.

30:00.008 --> 30:01.844
Well, come with me
and we'll work it out.

30:01.969 --> 30:03.804
You're not listening.

30:09.142 --> 30:10.811
This is their fault.

30:12.145 --> 30:14.481
You shot a boy in the back.

30:15.649 --> 30:16.859
You weren't there.

30:16.984 --> 30:18.735
Well I'm here now.

30:18.819 --> 30:20.487
Come with me, Jackson.

30:20.529 --> 30:21.989
Hey!

30:22.030 --> 30:23.156
Hey!

30:23.198 --> 30:24.366
Son of a!

30:30.372 --> 30:31.498
Come on!

30:34.042 --> 30:34.877
Shit.

30:35.002 --> 30:35.878
Where do you think you're going?

30:36.003 --> 30:37.838
There's no where to go!

30:41.008 --> 30:42.843
There's no where to go.

31:08.368 --> 31:09.203
Jackson!

31:10.412 --> 31:12.539
You got no where to go!

31:28.222 --> 31:29.556
Ya, come on boy!

31:30.557 --> 31:31.558
Go go!

31:32.434 --> 31:33.435
Come on boy.

31:36.897 --> 31:38.815
Good job Sundance, come on.

31:38.899 --> 31:40.442
Come on Sundance.

31:40.567 --> 31:41.568
Come on.

31:43.070 --> 31:44.571
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:46.907 --> 31:47.741
God damn.

31:49.910 --> 31:51.328
Good job Sundance, come on.

31:51.411 --> 31:52.579
Come on Sunny.

32:00.587 --> 32:01.922
Ya!

33:18.332 --> 33:19.374
How's he doing?

33:19.499 --> 33:21.919
How dare you chase
our son off to Mexico

33:22.002 --> 33:24.004
like he's some criminal.

33:26.340 --> 33:28.175
Call your son, Mr Greer.

33:28.217 --> 33:29.676
Tell him to come home.

33:29.718 --> 33:32.346
I told you before, Jackson
had nothing to do with this.

33:32.387 --> 33:35.182
That's all I'm
gonna say about it.

33:35.224 --> 33:37.684
Ma'am, he is not
safe out there.

33:37.726 --> 33:39.186
Things could get a lot worse.

33:39.228 --> 33:40.562
Worse?

33:40.687 --> 33:43.232
They gut shot our son
right in our front 40.

33:43.357 --> 33:45.734
With your husband's rifle.

33:45.859 --> 33:47.361
A child died too.

33:50.197 --> 33:51.698
I suggest you both
start helping me

33:51.740 --> 33:53.909
before you run out of sons.

33:54.034 --> 33:55.410
Call your son, Mr Greer.

33:55.536 --> 33:56.370
Ma'am.

34:16.764 --> 34:19.226
Come on, it's all we got.

34:22.771 --> 34:23.730
Suit yourself.

34:58.265 --> 35:00.642
Yeah, I thought
I recognized you.

35:08.650 --> 35:10.611
Easy, easy easy easy.

35:11.612 --> 35:12.654
Easy girl, easy.

35:14.448 --> 35:15.449
Easy, easy.

35:45.479 --> 35:46.813
You're all right.

35:58.492 --> 35:59.493
There you go.

36:00.494 --> 36:01.328
Go on.

36:03.497 --> 36:05.332
Go, go on, you're free.

36:06.667 --> 36:07.751
Go!

36:07.835 --> 36:08.710
Go on!

36:11.213 --> 36:12.172
God.

36:16.718 --> 36:17.719
Come on, go.

36:21.682 --> 36:22.599
Go boy, run you dumb cow!

36:22.683 --> 36:23.851
Go on, go!

36:23.892 --> 36:24.852
Go on!

36:36.029 --> 36:37.865
What you looking at?

36:57.926 --> 36:59.887
You made your point.

37:00.929 --> 37:01.889
Ah.

37:13.734 --> 37:14.776
Hey, this is Jackson Greer.

37:14.902 --> 37:16.153
Leave a message and
I'll call you back.

37:16.236 --> 37:17.070
Gig 'em.

37:18.906 --> 37:21.909
Jackson, I need
you to come home son.

37:24.578 --> 37:25.454
Call me.

38:41.697 --> 38:42.698
No, I need water.

38:42.823 --> 38:43.907
Oh.

38:47.494 --> 38:48.996
I don't speak Spanish.

38:49.037 --> 38:50.330
100 pesos.

38:52.708 --> 38:53.667
100.

38:55.002 --> 38:58.714
How much is this in pesos?

38:58.839 --> 38:59.673
Come on man, you're robbing me.

38:59.715 --> 39:00.549
I know it don't cost that much.

39:00.674 --> 39:01.508
Hey hey.

39:03.051 --> 39:04.011
Drink up.

39:08.891 --> 39:10.517
Where you headed?

39:13.687 --> 39:15.689
Gracias for the water.

39:23.906 --> 39:26.575
You think you can
help me find a ride?

39:26.700 --> 39:28.035
Sure.

39:28.076 --> 39:29.578
How much you got?

39:29.703 --> 39:30.746
Not much.

39:30.871 --> 39:33.373
Relax, just leave
the horse with me.

39:39.046 --> 39:40.923
So how you like Mexico, huh?

39:46.053 --> 39:46.929
Back!

39:47.721 --> 39:48.889
Back God damn it!

39:48.931 --> 39:49.890
Get back!

39:50.933 --> 39:52.601
Back up.

39:52.726 --> 39:53.560
Back!

39:54.228 --> 39:55.062
Back!

40:10.577 --> 40:11.411
Ya, ya!

40:21.421 --> 40:22.589
Mr Almeida?

40:25.592 --> 40:26.677
Sorry for your loss, sir.

40:26.760 --> 40:27.970
Thank you.

40:28.095 --> 40:29.972
I do need to see some
ID before you can see him.

40:30.097 --> 40:31.974
I'm not concerned with
your immigration status,

40:32.099 --> 40:33.517
that's not why I'm here.

40:33.600 --> 40:34.935
Thank you, sir.

40:37.938 --> 40:39.940
You got a green card.

40:39.982 --> 40:41.984
Why was your son
crossing illegally?

40:42.109 --> 40:45.487
I filed an I-130
petition to bring him.

40:45.612 --> 40:46.780
He was denied.

40:48.949 --> 40:49.950
I'm sorry.

40:51.785 --> 40:53.829
Uh, you want him
buried in Mexico?

40:53.954 --> 40:56.498
Guanajuato, our hometown.

40:56.623 --> 40:57.499
Of course.

40:57.624 --> 40:59.001
Truly again, I'm sorry sir.

40:59.126 --> 41:00.002
May I go see my son?

41:00.127 --> 41:02.004
Absolutely, follow me.

42:17.579 --> 42:19.039
Hold it please.

42:26.213 --> 42:27.214
Thanks.

43:08.130 --> 43:09.131
Stop stop stop.

43:09.256 --> 43:10.257
Stop, I gotta get off.

43:10.299 --> 43:11.633
Stop, stop.

44:02.684 --> 44:04.561
You're not alone.

44:09.316 --> 44:12.152
No father should bury his son.

44:15.197 --> 44:17.991
So, how are we gonna
handle this kid?

44:18.033 --> 44:18.867
He's headed south on a

44:18.992 --> 44:22.663
horse.

44:23.705 --> 44:26.667
I'm going to do this alone.

44:26.708 --> 44:28.669
And he's not a kid.

44:33.340 --> 44:35.342
Padre, I liked your hijo.

44:37.344 --> 44:38.345
Strong.

45:11.712 --> 45:12.713
Come on.

46:27.955 --> 46:29.831
Do you have water?

46:47.140 --> 46:48.183
What are you doing out here?

46:48.308 --> 46:50.185
Um, camping.

46:50.310 --> 46:51.144
Camping?

47:07.160 --> 47:09.329
I just need help.

47:09.371 --> 47:11.039
I can work for you.

47:11.164 --> 47:12.374
I know cattle.

47:12.499 --> 47:13.333
Cattle.

47:13.417 --> 47:14.251
Cattle, horses.

47:14.334 --> 47:15.586
Horses.

47:15.669 --> 47:16.503
Si, yeah. I
work, I work for you, sir.

47:17.504 --> 47:18.338
Yes, work.

47:18.422 --> 47:19.256

47:19.339 --> 47:20.215
Okay.

47:21.341 --> 47:22.176
Okay.

47:42.863 --> 47:44.072
Come on.

47:44.198 --> 47:45.449
You're all right.

47:45.532 --> 47:46.867
You're okay.

47:46.909 --> 47:47.784
Come on.

47:47.868 --> 47:50.204
Come on Sundance, good boy.

47:51.371 --> 47:52.539
Thank you man.

47:53.874 --> 47:54.958
No.

47:59.588 --> 48:00.547
With horses.

48:01.882 --> 48:03.050
Horses.

48:03.091 --> 48:04.051
Yes, yes.

48:58.605 --> 48:59.606
Wow.

49:00.607 --> 49:03.360
Aren't you gonna
thank my father?

49:03.443 --> 49:05.279
Hey, thank you, sir.

49:10.284 --> 49:11.285
Oh, nothing.

49:13.120 --> 49:13.954
I'm good.

49:14.621 --> 49:16.164
Work?

49:16.290 --> 49:17.624
Yeah, I can work.

49:20.335 --> 49:21.170
Bring the horse.

49:21.295 --> 49:22.129
Yup.

49:30.637 --> 49:32.139
It's infected.

49:45.652 --> 49:49.531
I just don't want you to die
on my property, you know?

49:49.656 --> 49:50.490
Liability.

49:52.492 --> 49:53.493
Thank you.

49:55.162 --> 49:55.996
Gracias.

50:12.221 --> 50:13.222
Morning.

50:18.685 --> 50:21.522
God helps those
who get up early.

50:23.023 --> 50:24.233
Sure.

50:24.358 --> 50:26.401
How's your hand?

50:26.527 --> 50:27.361
It's better.

50:27.402 --> 50:28.237
- Good.

50:28.362 --> 50:29.196
Work?

50:30.739 --> 50:32.074
Yes sir.

50:32.199 --> 50:33.075
Yeah I'm good to go.

I can rope, ride, shoe, sheer.

50:35.202 --> 50:36.036
Work.

50:38.539 --> 50:39.373
Work.

52:12.466 --> 52:13.300

52:40.327 --> 52:41.703
Hey man.

52:41.828 --> 52:43.330
Hey you gotta teach
him direction first.

52:43.372 --> 52:44.831
Yeah yeah!

52:44.873 --> 52:46.375
I mean he's no good unless
he knows where he's going.

52:46.500 --> 52:48.877
Yeah, you keep
shoveling shit man.

54:21.595 --> 54:22.429
Whoa.

54:23.430 --> 54:24.431
Whoa, whoa.

54:28.936 --> 54:29.770

Come on, left.

55:00.801 --> 55:01.969
Nice, there you go Cero.

56:16.043 --> 56:18.712
Sundance is gonna get jealous.

56:20.047 --> 56:21.089
Not bad, huh?

56:21.215 --> 56:22.925
No, not bad.

56:23.050 --> 56:23.926
Oh oh oh.

56:24.885 --> 56:28.931
Come on, we'll take
you to Raphael's.

56:29.056 --> 56:30.432
What's Raphael's?

56:30.557 --> 56:31.558
You'll see.

56:34.061 --> 56:34.895
Ooh.

56:44.571 --> 56:46.740
Are you ready to have fun?

56:52.412 --> 56:53.247
Hola.

57:02.256 --> 57:03.423

57:07.803 --> 57:09.596

57:14.434 --> 57:17.354
Who's the cute white guy?

57:17.437 --> 57:19.106
Him?

57:19.189 --> 57:21.024
He's not so cute.

57:23.861 --> 57:27.155
Your boyfriend
smells like a dog's ass.

57:28.115 --> 57:29.950
He's not my boyfriend!

57:32.661 --> 57:33.704
Pero's a dog, right?

57:33.787 --> 57:34.955
Yeah, right.

57:34.997 --> 57:35.831
What's a culo?

57:37.457 --> 57:38.625
Aw, tell him what it is!

57:38.667 --> 57:39.501
No no no.

57:40.711 --> 57:42.379
You're the "culo"!

57:42.462 --> 57:43.964
You don't wanna know,
you don't wanna know.

57:44.298 --> 57:46.466
OK, so why's he in my bar?

57:46.550 --> 57:48.302
- Your bar?
- My bar!

57:48.385 --> 57:50.470
No, it's not your bar!

57:50.554 --> 57:53.473
This bar belongs
to the one and only...

57:53.557 --> 57:54.474
RAPHAEL!!

57:55.142 --> 57:56.727

Ladies and gentlemen

star attraction

58:05.736 --> 58:07.821
Raphael!

58:11.825 --> 58:14.828
Place your bets, everyone!

58:19.166 --> 58:20.167
This is Rafi.

Yeah.

58:21.168 --> 58:22.044
Raphael?

58:22.169 --> 58:23.754
Raphael, yes.

58:23.837 --> 58:26.006
And this is
Donatello, and that's.

58:26.048 --> 58:26.882

58:27.007 --> 58:29.551

58:29.676 --> 58:30.719
- Yeah.

58:42.231 --> 58:44.942
Hey, you touch my horse
again and I'm gonna kill you.

58:45.025 --> 58:45.943
Hey, no no no no.

58:46.026 --> 58:50.197
This asshole
tried to steal my horse.

58:53.534 --> 58:55.911
Your time's coming,
Jackson Greer.

58:56.036 --> 58:57.579
Yeah yeah.

Hey hey hey.

Come on!

59:11.885 --> 59:14.096
There we go, there we go!

59:30.571 --> 59:32.072
You wanna dance?

59:32.906 --> 59:33.740
I will try.

59:33.782 --> 59:34.741
Okay.

59:37.077 --> 59:38.912
I like that attitude.

59:41.248 --> 59:42.124
This is banda.

59:42.249 --> 59:43.083
Banda.

59:43.125 --> 59:44.626
Banda.

59:44.751 --> 59:45.627
Bad ass.

59:45.752 --> 59:47.588
Yeah, it is bad ass.

59:48.922 --> 59:52.259
This is how we do
it where I come from.

59:54.636 --> 59:55.470
Hola.

59:55.596 --> 59:57.139
- Hola.

1:00:06.607 --> 1:00:08.275
And a shot of tequila.

1:00:29.296 --> 1:00:30.297
Sundance.

1:00:30.339 --> 1:00:32.299
Sundance, come on man.

1:00:32.341 --> 1:00:33.300
Sundance.

1:00:36.803 --> 1:00:37.804
Yeah I know.

1:00:44.978 --> 1:00:45.854
Hey.

1:00:45.979 --> 1:00:46.813
Hey.

1:00:47.814 --> 1:00:48.815
Wake up man.

1:00:53.654 --> 1:00:55.572
Man, it's Sunday.

1:00:55.656 --> 1:00:56.573
So.

1:00:56.657 --> 1:00:59.701
So, we do it big on Sundays.

1:00:59.826 --> 1:01:00.994
Sunday breakfast.

1:01:01.036 --> 1:01:03.330
Nah man, that's family
stuff, you go ahead.

1:01:03.372 --> 1:01:04.665
No.

1:01:04.706 --> 1:01:06.333
Come on, let's go.

1:01:06.375 --> 1:01:08.335
Hangover's no excuse.

1:01:08.377 --> 1:01:10.254
Man, I'm still drunk.

1:01:10.337 --> 1:01:12.172
Sunday breakfast man.

1:01:41.368 --> 1:01:42.244
Enjoy it.

1:01:42.369 --> 1:01:43.370
Oh.

1:01:44.246 --> 1:01:45.205
Gracias.

1:01:51.545 --> 1:01:53.255
My father likes you.

1:01:53.380 --> 1:01:56.258
That means a lot, you know.

1:01:56.383 --> 1:01:59.928
I think you can stay here
as long as you keep working.

1:02:04.391 --> 1:02:08.437
Um, that means, we are
all cattle drovers,

1:02:08.562 --> 1:02:11.815
so we all meet
again down the road.

1:02:11.899 --> 1:02:15.235
My father loves his.

1:02:19.573 --> 1:02:21.783
Rafi, Rafi, Rafi, Rafi!

1:02:36.298 --> 1:02:37.925
You want some?

1:02:48.435 --> 1:02:49.436
Excuse me.

1:03:09.122 --> 1:03:10.999
- Dad.
- Jackson.

1:03:11.124 --> 1:03:14.169
Thank God, where are you son?

1:03:14.294 --> 1:03:15.838
How's Lucas?

1:03:15.963 --> 1:03:18.173
Surgery's tomorrow.

1:03:18.298 --> 1:03:21.218
You come home now you
can still make it.

1:03:21.301 --> 1:03:23.011
We need you.

1:03:23.136 --> 1:03:24.012
Dad, I can't sleep.

1:03:24.137 --> 1:03:25.347
No, listen to me Jackson.

1:03:25.472 --> 1:03:27.015
I want you to listen to me, boy.

1:03:27.140 --> 1:03:28.475
This is not your fault.

1:03:28.517 --> 1:03:29.351
You understand me?

1:03:29.476 --> 1:03:30.894
It's not your fault, okay?

1:03:30.978 --> 1:03:32.187
I want, I want you to
tell me where you are

1:03:32.312 --> 1:03:34.189
and I want to get you back here.

1:03:34.314 --> 1:03:35.315
I took
his life, dad.

1:03:35.357 --> 1:03:37.484
No, listen to me son.

1:03:38.485 --> 1:03:39.987
Texas Rangers are
gonna come get you.

1:03:40.028 --> 1:03:41.196
They're gonna come get you now.

1:03:41.321 --> 1:03:42.197
I wanna know where
you are right now.

1:03:42.322 --> 1:03:43.365
You tell me where you are.

1:03:45.492 --> 1:03:46.493
Jackson.

1:03:55.502 --> 1:03:57.254
Good, yeah yeah.

1:03:57.337 --> 1:03:59.715
Text me the location.

1:03:59.840 --> 1:04:01.383
You did the right
thing, Mr Greer.

1:04:01.508 --> 1:04:03.552
If you can't bring
our son home safe,

1:04:03.677 --> 1:04:06.054
you better stay down there.

1:04:07.014 --> 1:04:08.557
- Yes ma'am.
- Hey.

1:04:08.682 --> 1:04:10.517
Just bring my son home.

1:04:24.364 --> 1:04:25.240
Jackson.

1:04:28.911 --> 1:04:31.246
How did that coyote at
the bar know your name?

1:04:31.371 --> 1:04:33.248
I don't know.

1:04:33.373 --> 1:04:34.208
I gotta go.

1:04:35.584 --> 1:04:37.211
Go where?

1:04:43.050 --> 1:04:45.260
You know where Guanajuato is?

1:04:45.385 --> 1:04:46.386
Que?

1:04:46.428 --> 1:04:47.262
Guanajuato.

1:04:47.387 --> 1:04:48.388
Is it a city?

1:04:48.430 --> 1:04:50.933
Is it close to here?

1:04:51.058 --> 1:04:52.601
You really are lost.

1:04:52.726 --> 1:04:55.145
Just tell me if
it's close or not.

1:04:55.229 --> 1:04:57.814
Come on, what does it
take, two days ride, three?

1:04:57.898 --> 1:05:00.067
It's too far on a horse.

1:05:09.576 --> 1:05:11.245
Okay, Jesus, I'll
take care of Sundance

1:05:11.286 --> 1:05:14.581
until you get back
from your, whatever.

1:05:17.584 --> 1:05:19.419
I'll give you a minute.

1:05:37.104 --> 1:05:37.980
Hey.

1:05:43.610 --> 1:05:45.612
Don't do anything stupid.

1:05:48.448 --> 1:05:49.616
Hey, I love you.

1:06:34.661 --> 1:06:35.996
God damn it!

1:07:16.078 --> 1:07:17.037
Hey.

1:07:19.373 --> 1:07:20.707
Here's your ticket.

1:07:27.214 --> 1:07:28.590
This is too much.

1:07:28.715 --> 1:07:32.594
We've been trying to break
that horse for a whole year.

1:07:32.719 --> 1:07:35.597
Well he ain't
broke yet, he just,

1:07:35.722 --> 1:07:37.224
knows where to go.

1:07:47.734 --> 1:07:51.238
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

1:07:59.079 --> 1:07:59.913
Hey.

1:08:03.083 --> 1:08:05.419
We all meet again
down the road, right?

1:08:05.460 --> 1:08:07.087
Like your dad says.

1:08:41.121 --> 1:08:45.334
And sure enough, there was
Tom Sawyer waiting for me.

1:08:45.459 --> 1:08:47.336
I sat still and listened.

1:08:47.461 --> 1:08:51.131
Directly I could just barely
hear a meow, meow down there.

1:08:51.173 --> 1:08:53.675
Says I, meow, meow,
as soft as I could,

1:08:53.800 --> 1:08:54.676
and then I put out the light

1:08:54.801 --> 1:08:57.804
and scrambled out the
window onto the shed.

1:08:57.845 --> 1:08:59.515
Then I slipped
down to the ground

1:08:59.640 --> 1:09:02.184
and crawled in amongst the
trees, and sure enough.

1:09:02.309 --> 1:09:03.810
You wanna trade?

1:09:05.645 --> 1:09:06.688
Sorry.

1:09:06.813 --> 1:09:08.398
No, it's okay.

1:09:08.482 --> 1:09:09.358
It's okay.

1:09:10.317 --> 1:09:14.029
Uh,.

1:09:18.825 --> 1:09:20.160
Gracias senor.

1:09:21.495 --> 1:09:22.662
What kind of weird
fruit it this?

1:09:22.703 --> 1:09:24.331
Prickly pear.

1:09:24.372 --> 1:09:25.541
Try it.

1:09:25.666 --> 1:09:26.667
All right.

1:09:31.505 --> 1:09:32.421
That's awesome man.

1:09:32.506 --> 1:09:34.341
- Yeah.
- Awesome man.

1:09:36.343 --> 1:09:37.845
What's she making you read?

1:09:37.886 --> 1:09:40.721
Uh, "The Adventures
of Huckleberry Finn."

1:09:40.848 --> 1:09:42.765
That's a classic.

1:09:42.850 --> 1:09:44.184
What's your favorite part?

1:09:44.225 --> 1:09:46.687
Nothing, it's just boring.

1:09:46.728 --> 1:09:47.563
What?

1:09:47.688 --> 1:09:49.189
B-boring?

1:09:49.231 --> 1:09:50.189
Huck Finn?

1:09:51.692 --> 1:09:53.402
Has he met the King yet?

1:09:53.527 --> 1:09:54.778
A king?

1:09:54.862 --> 1:09:55.737
There's no king.

1:09:55.863 --> 1:09:57.865
Si, a king, duke, gold.

1:10:00.868 --> 1:10:03.579
Treasure, action, even murder.

1:10:05.372 --> 1:10:06.415
Hm, if there's violence I
think we should not read this.

1:10:06.540 --> 1:10:08.250
No no no no no.

1:10:11.253 --> 1:10:12.421
Chapter two?

1:10:13.881 --> 1:10:15.257
Uh, I can't.

1:10:15.382 --> 1:10:16.383
Can't read?

1:10:19.720 --> 1:10:20.721
All right.

1:10:22.556 --> 1:10:23.557
Let's do it.

1:10:26.268 --> 1:10:27.227
Okay.

1:10:30.230 --> 1:10:33.233
Chapter two, "The
Boys Escape Jim."

1:10:35.569 --> 1:10:38.614
We went tip-toeing along
a path amongst the trees

1:10:38.739 --> 1:10:41.909
back towards the end
of the widow's garden.

1:10:41.950 --> 1:10:46.788
Stooping down so as the branches
wouldn't scrape our heads.

1:10:46.914 --> 1:10:48.290
When we was passing
by the kitchen,

1:10:48.415 --> 1:10:51.418
I fell over a root
and made a noise.

1:10:51.460 --> 1:10:54.421
Ms Watson's big,
friend, named Jim,

1:10:55.923 --> 1:10:58.467
was sitting in the kitchen door.

1:10:59.927 --> 1:11:00.802
We could see him pretty clear

1:11:00.928 --> 1:11:03.597
because there was
a light behind him.

1:11:03.639 --> 1:11:05.807
He got up and
stretched his neck out

1:11:05.933 --> 1:11:08.602
about a minute, listening.

1:11:08.644 --> 1:11:11.355
Then he says, who there?

1:11:11.438 --> 1:11:12.814
He listened some more.

1:11:12.940 --> 1:11:16.652
Then he come tip-toeing down
and stood right between us.

1:11:16.777 --> 1:11:18.779
We could have
touched him, nearly.

1:11:18.820 --> 1:11:21.198
Well, likely it was
minutes and minutes

1:11:21.281 --> 1:11:23.367
that there weren't a sound.

1:11:23.450 --> 1:11:26.453
And we all there
so close together.

1:11:36.797 --> 1:11:37.798
Sir.

1:11:37.840 --> 1:11:40.342
Senor, I've been waiting
here for hours, now come on.

1:11:40.467 --> 1:11:43.387
My counselor called
your boss, okay?

1:11:43.470 --> 1:11:44.346
Jackson Greer's murder case.

1:11:46.139 --> 1:11:48.725
It's a murder case senor.

1:11:53.981 --> 1:11:54.982
Son of a bitch.

1:11:56.358 --> 1:11:57.985
Adios douche bag.

1:11:58.026 --> 1:11:58.986
Shit.

1:12:15.836 --> 1:12:16.670
Jackson.

1:12:17.838 --> 1:12:20.007
Are you still okay?

1:12:20.048 --> 1:12:21.008
Yeah.

1:12:21.842 --> 1:12:22.676
He's a good kid.

1:12:22.718 --> 1:12:23.719
Thank you.

1:12:27.723 --> 1:12:29.892
Can I ask you something?

1:12:32.352 --> 1:12:34.438
Why you all headed south?

1:12:34.521 --> 1:12:36.398
We're just going
home for break?

1:12:36.523 --> 1:12:38.025
So it's that easy?

1:12:39.193 --> 1:12:42.529
I mean y'all can just
go back and forth?

1:12:46.700 --> 1:12:47.743
Huh?

1:12:47.868 --> 1:12:50.537
We're not all
immigrants, you know.

1:12:52.080 --> 1:12:54.041
I just figured 'cause you
were teaching him English,

1:12:54.082 --> 1:12:56.710
you'd be coming from America.

1:12:57.878 --> 1:13:01.381
We are in America
right now, you know?

1:13:01.423 --> 1:13:02.883
Latin America.

1:13:02.925 --> 1:13:03.884
Right.

1:13:05.052 --> 1:13:07.596
I'm an English
teacher in Tamaulipas.

1:13:07.721 --> 1:13:10.265
But we're headed home to Leon.

1:13:10.390 --> 1:13:11.600
You know, it's funny
what you just said

1:13:11.725 --> 1:13:13.894
about America and all.

1:13:13.936 --> 1:13:17.397
My, my dad says we
don't live in America.

1:13:19.066 --> 1:13:20.567
We live in Texas.

1:13:21.902 --> 1:13:24.571
And what, what does that mean?

1:13:26.782 --> 1:13:27.616
I don't know.

1:13:33.080 --> 1:13:34.748
Now I will admit, I,

1:13:36.250 --> 1:13:39.002
I didn't know how
big Mexico was.

1:13:39.086 --> 1:13:41.463
And where are you going?

1:13:42.756 --> 1:13:44.091
Ganajato.

1:13:44.132 --> 1:13:45.092
Where?

1:13:46.093 --> 1:13:46.927
Ganajato.

1:13:48.095 --> 1:13:49.304
You're going somewhere

1:13:49.429 --> 1:13:52.015
and you don't even know
how to pronounce it.

1:13:52.099 --> 1:13:55.102
I think you mean
Guanajuato, right?

1:13:57.646 --> 1:13:58.480
Guanajuato.

1:13:58.605 --> 1:13:59.439
Guanajuato

1:13:59.481 --> 1:14:00.440
Perfect.

1:14:12.119 --> 1:14:14.830
Remember when we
used to drop off water

1:14:14.955 --> 1:14:17.165
and blankets and jerky
down by the river?

1:14:17.291 --> 1:14:18.125
I do.

1:14:20.794 --> 1:14:22.629
What happened to us?

1:14:25.132 --> 1:14:27.509
You know, they just
kept coming and coming.

1:14:27.634 --> 1:14:30.053
I was just trying to protect us.

1:14:30.137 --> 1:14:31.388
And it's not like they're
little kids anymore

1:14:31.471 --> 1:14:33.724
looking for farm jobs.

1:14:33.807 --> 1:14:36.018
They're in our
backyards every week.

1:14:36.143 --> 1:14:41.148
And dealing with coyotes and
drugs and guns and cartels,

1:14:41.815 --> 1:14:42.858
in our backyard.

1:14:45.027 --> 1:14:47.029
I don't know what to do.

1:14:48.322 --> 1:14:49.990
It's different now.

1:14:51.033 --> 1:14:52.159
Yeah.

1:14:54.995 --> 1:14:56.663
But we're different.

1:15:00.709 --> 1:15:01.668
I know.

1:15:05.672 --> 1:15:07.382
I'm gonna make it right.

1:15:07.508 --> 1:15:09.051
I'll make it right.

1:15:29.029 --> 1:15:30.197
Why'd we stop?

1:15:31.740 --> 1:15:32.574
I don't know.

1:15:32.699 --> 1:15:35.202
There's no bus stop here.

1:15:35.244 --> 1:15:37.204
Something's wrong.

1:15:40.040 --> 1:15:42.125
Go sit with your mom.

1:16:02.062 --> 1:16:03.230
Hm, Jackson.

1:16:12.906 --> 1:16:13.740
Jackson.

1:16:15.075 --> 1:16:16.118
You might as well come out

1:16:16.243 --> 1:16:21.123
or I'm gonna start shooting
some people here, huh.

1:16:21.248 --> 1:16:23.250
You wanna make me do it?

1:16:26.253 --> 1:16:28.797
You wanna make me do it?
You wanna make me do it?

1:16:28.922 --> 1:16:31.258
Ay, ay, you got, you got me.

1:16:34.261 --> 1:16:36.597
Payback's a bitch, huh?

1:16:38.807 --> 1:16:40.601
Let's go, let's go.

1:16:49.276 --> 1:16:50.110
Come on.

1:16:55.616 --> 1:16:58.660
Isn't anybody
gonna do anything?

1:16:58.785 --> 1:17:00.829
Can't anybody help him?

1:17:00.954 --> 1:17:05.167
- Nobody's going to help him?
- Keep your stupid brat quiet!

1:17:08.462 --> 1:17:10.047
Let him go!

1:17:11.173 --> 1:17:12.674
Shut the hell up!

1:17:16.803 --> 1:17:18.847
Hey hey hey. You
got me, you got me!

1:17:18.972 --> 1:17:20.140
Let's just go.

1:17:31.151 --> 1:17:34.029
No cell phone,
hey no cell phone.

1:17:34.154 --> 1:17:35.656
No cell phone!

1:17:35.697 --> 1:17:36.532
No, cell phone!

1:17:36.657 --> 1:17:38.033
Hey asshole!

1:17:47.501 --> 1:17:50.212
Get him! I'll go around!

1:19:33.315 --> 1:19:34.858
Ah!

1:19:49.957 --> 1:19:52.334
Did you get him?

1:20:38.338 --> 1:20:40.716
Where's the gringo going?

1:20:44.887 --> 1:20:47.764
Where's the gringo going?

1:20:52.519 --> 1:20:53.353
Are you deaf?

1:20:53.395 --> 1:20:55.189
Are you deaf?

1:20:55.522 --> 1:20:57.357
No? You want him to be deaf?

1:20:57.399 --> 1:21:00.068
No no no no!
Not my son! Not my son!

1:21:02.529 --> 1:21:03.864
No no no no no.

1:21:03.947 --> 1:21:04.907
No no no!

1:25:34.176 --> 1:25:35.010
Policia.

1:25:36.470 --> 1:25:38.305
Oh Jesus, don't shoot.

1:25:38.347 --> 1:25:40.682
Don't shoot, I'm a Texas Ranger.

1:25:40.807 --> 1:25:42.684
They still have that?

1:25:43.685 --> 1:25:45.562
Yeah, they still have that.

They still, they

1:25:49.316 --> 1:25:51.026
and we have the
right to protect it.

1:25:51.151 --> 1:25:52.402

1:25:52.486 --> 1:25:53.654
I totally get that,

1:25:53.695 --> 1:25:55.822
I'm just looking for
the owner of this horse.

1:25:55.864 --> 1:25:57.699
He's not here.

1:25:57.824 --> 1:25:59.409
I'm sorry, you're right.

1:25:59.493 --> 1:26:00.702

1:26:44.872 --> 1:26:46.123
That's it.

1:26:46.206 --> 1:26:47.040

1:27:01.930 --> 1:27:03.599
Jackson.

1:27:18.906 --> 1:27:19.907
Hm.

1:27:26.788 --> 1:27:27.915
Headquarters.

1:27:27.956 --> 1:27:30.626
Hey, I need an address on

1:27:30.751 --> 1:27:33.837

1:28:47.995 --> 1:28:49.705
You gotta eat too?

1:28:54.501 --> 1:28:55.335
You gotta eat.

No no no, tu, tu eat, eat.

Caliente.

1:29:21.069 --> 1:29:22.029
Ah.

1:29:26.200 --> 1:29:27.951
That's good.

1:29:28.035 --> 1:29:29.453
This for your kids?

1:29:31.079 --> 1:29:32.039
No.

1:29:33.707 --> 1:29:36.585
But you made all these.

1:29:38.545 --> 1:29:39.922
Uh, usted.

1:29:40.047 --> 1:29:41.048
Si.

Eat.

1:29:43.717 --> 1:29:45.552
- Eat, eat.

1:29:51.558 --> 1:29:52.392
It is good.

1:30:22.422 --> 1:30:23.257
Martin?

1:30:26.969 --> 1:30:28.095
Rosa?

1:31:42.711 --> 1:31:43.545
No no, okay!

1:32:20.207 --> 1:32:21.083
Son...

1:32:23.377 --> 1:32:25.045
It's time.

1:32:50.237 --> 1:32:51.071
Whoa whoa, hey!

1:32:51.113 --> 1:32:52.656
Hey.

1:32:52.739 --> 1:32:54.616
Texas Ranger.

1:32:54.741 --> 1:32:55.826
Texas Ranger, my prisoner.

1:32:55.909 --> 1:32:56.785
You all right?

1:32:56.910 --> 1:32:58.120
My shoulder.

1:32:58.245 --> 1:32:59.121
Okay, we'll get that
taken care of, all right.

1:33:04.293 --> 1:33:05.627
Cross your legs,
cross your legs.

1:33:05.752 --> 1:33:06.587
Okay.

1:33:07.296 --> 1:33:08.130
All right, that's my prisoner.

1:33:08.255 --> 1:33:10.299
Si si si si.

1:33:10.424 --> 1:33:12.176
Hang on, all right. I'm gonna
get you signed over to me.

1:33:12.259 --> 1:33:13.177
Get you home, we'll
get this sorted out.

1:33:56.970 --> 1:34:00.682
Jackson, you want some
ice for that shoulder?

1:34:03.310 --> 1:34:04.853
I read your letter.

1:34:06.313 --> 1:34:07.189
It's contrite.

1:34:09.191 --> 1:34:11.860
They take that all into account.

1:34:15.989 --> 1:34:19.660
Your parents will be
happy to have you home.

1:34:21.328 --> 1:34:24.206
Fernando will still be dead.

1:34:24.331 --> 1:34:25.165
Yes sir.

1:34:26.834 --> 1:34:28.836
And you'll pay for that.

1:34:56.905 --> 1:34:58.949
Hey, hey puto.

1:34:59.032 --> 1:35:00.742
- Quiet.
- Hey, you with the hat.

1:35:00.868 --> 1:35:02.035
Hey.

1:35:02.077 --> 1:35:03.245
- Hey you bitch.
- Quiet. Hey, Jackson, quiet.

1:35:03.370 --> 1:35:04.746
Oh, ooh.

1:35:05.038 --> 1:35:09.376
Your girlfriend
smells like a dog's ass!

1:35:14.882 --> 1:35:16.258
Boy.
Yeah.

1:35:18.051 --> 1:35:19.303
Hey, shut it down.

1:35:23.724 --> 1:35:24.933
Back up.

1:35:28.562 --> 1:35:30.898
Back up, back up, back up.

1:35:32.399 --> 1:35:33.442
Dang.

1:35:46.455 --> 1:35:47.289
Shit.

1:35:47.414 --> 1:35:48.415
Jackson!

1:35:48.457 --> 1:35:50.000
Don't move.

1:35:50.083 --> 1:35:51.418
Don't you dare.

1:35:54.296 --> 1:35:55.422
Shit.

1:37:53.540 --> 1:37:54.875
Hello?

1:37:56.543 --> 1:37:57.377
Luke?

1:37:58.420 --> 1:37:59.421
Hey, Jackson man.

1:37:59.546 --> 1:38:00.964
Where, where are you?

1:38:01.048 --> 1:38:02.382
Oh man, it's good
to hear your voice.

1:38:02.424 --> 1:38:04.259
It's good to hear
your voice too man.

1:38:04.384 --> 1:38:05.219
Put it on speaker phone.

1:38:05.260 --> 1:38:06.386
Hey, Jacks.

1:38:07.429 --> 1:38:08.430
How you feeling?

1:38:08.555 --> 1:38:09.890
I'm all right man.

1:38:09.932 --> 1:38:12.559
You know the, they
got the bullet out.

1:38:12.601 --> 1:38:14.394
Slid out like, like butter man.

1:38:14.436 --> 1:38:15.938
You sound strong.

1:38:16.063 --> 1:38:17.231
Tell you what,

1:38:17.272 --> 1:38:20.442
be doing a lot better
if you were here, man.

1:38:20.567 --> 1:38:23.403
Jackson, I, I need you here man.

1:38:26.573 --> 1:38:29.284
You know, Mexico's
not like I thought.

1:38:29.409 --> 1:38:31.453
Oh, Jackson honey, you're,

1:38:31.578 --> 1:38:33.455
it's okay, you come on home now.

1:38:33.580 --> 1:38:34.414
Mom?

1:38:34.456 --> 1:38:35.958
- Yeah.
- Mom.

1:38:36.083 --> 1:38:37.835
I've been thinking about you.

1:38:37.918 --> 1:38:39.127
I've been thinking
about all of you.

1:38:39.253 --> 1:38:40.295
Jackson, son,

1:38:40.420 --> 1:38:41.964
listen to me, it's
not your fault, okay?

1:38:42.089 --> 1:38:43.340
Dad's right man.

1:38:43.423 --> 1:38:45.467
You were just, you were
doing the best you could man.

1:38:45.592 --> 1:38:47.970
You were trying to
protect everybody.

1:38:48.095 --> 1:38:49.596
Where are you man?

1:38:51.098 --> 1:38:53.308
Hey, you remember
what we talked about?

1:38:53.433 --> 1:38:54.977
Yeah, about what?

1:38:55.102 --> 1:38:56.478
The fishing pond.

1:38:56.603 --> 1:38:57.855
Yeah, of course man.

1:38:57.938 --> 1:38:59.606
We would talk about a
lot of things, Jackson.

1:38:59.648 --> 1:39:01.483
Hey, why don't you
come on home man.

1:39:01.608 --> 1:39:04.444
We'll talk about all this too.

1:39:04.486 --> 1:39:05.946
I was wrong.

1:39:08.448 --> 1:39:10.450
I was wrong about a lot.

1:39:12.619 --> 1:39:13.453
Jackson,
listen to me man.

1:39:13.537 --> 1:39:15.330
It's all right to be
wrong sometimes, okay?

1:39:15.455 --> 1:39:18.292
You just, just come on home man.

1:39:18.333 --> 1:39:19.501
I need you man.

1:39:19.626 --> 1:39:21.461
I need my little brother back.

1:39:28.302 --> 1:39:29.178
Jackson.

1:39:32.639 --> 1:39:34.516
I love you guys.

1:39:34.641 --> 1:39:36.852
Jackson,
listen, don't hang up.

1:41:18.954 --> 1:41:19.788
Oh, hey.

1:41:19.913 --> 1:41:22.583
Do you know where
the people who live here are?

1:41:22.624 --> 1:41:24.293
In the Cathedral
of San Francisco.

1:41:24.793 --> 1:41:27.629
Heavenly Father,
receive your blessed son

1:41:27.754 --> 1:41:30.007
and give him eternal peace.

1:41:30.090 --> 1:41:33.302
Help this family to
accept Your will.

1:41:33.427 --> 1:41:36.597
May the blessings of Almighty
God be upon you.

1:41:36.680 --> 1:41:41.602
In the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost.

1:41:41.685 --> 1:41:45.689
Go in peace. This
concludes the Mass.

1:42:21.808 --> 1:42:24.811
I'll meet you outside, mom.

1:42:26.813 --> 1:42:28.649
Please.

1:42:46.917 --> 1:42:48.669
Dog.

1:43:30.711 --> 1:43:32.880
What are you doing here?

1:43:40.554 --> 1:43:41.889
This is yours.

1:44:08.790 --> 1:44:09.750
Just do it.

1:44:53.961 --> 1:44:54.962
Get up.

1:45:05.806 --> 1:45:07.641
Why did you do that?

1:45:16.024 --> 1:45:17.693
Why did you do that?

1:45:20.487 --> 1:45:21.321
I'm sorry.

1:45:27.494 --> 1:45:28.370
I'm sorry.

1:45:37.004 --> 1:45:38.839
What about your son, padre?

1:45:43.218 --> 1:45:44.386
Don't, Luis.

1:45:45.721 --> 1:45:46.722
Don't.

1:45:52.019 --> 1:45:52.853
He killed your son.

1:45:56.857 --> 1:45:57.691
Luis.

1:45:57.733 --> 1:45:58.901
Piece of crap!

1:46:02.029 --> 1:46:05.949
I've forgiven him.

1:46:06.033 --> 1:46:08.911
Let me do this or you'll
never forgive yourself.

1:46:09.036 --> 1:46:09.953
Luis!

1:46:10.037 --> 1:46:11.872
He killed your son.

1:46:13.040 --> 1:46:14.958
He killed your son.

1:46:15.042 --> 1:46:16.627
- Luis!
- Padre!

1:46:16.710 --> 1:46:17.920
Hey!

1:46:23.884 --> 1:46:24.968
Oh Jesus.

1:46:25.052 --> 1:46:26.386
Hey.

1:46:27.721 --> 1:46:28.555
Hey.

1:46:34.228 --> 1:46:35.395
Are you okay?

1:46:51.078 --> 1:46:53.080
Gustavo.

1:46:53.163 --> 1:46:55.165
I'm alright, mom.

1:47:01.964 --> 1:47:04.299
Poor creature.

1:47:06.093 --> 1:47:08.595
I just wanted to help you.

1:47:23.944 --> 1:47:25.529
- Can you walk?
- Yeah, can you help me up?

1:47:25.612 --> 1:47:27.489
I got you, I got you.

1:47:27.614 --> 1:47:28.448
I got you.

1:47:44.840 --> 1:47:45.799
Thank you.

1:47:49.136 --> 1:47:49.970
Go home.

1:48:13.660 --> 1:48:14.494
God damn.

1:48:15.162 --> 1:48:15.996
You all right?

1:48:16.038 --> 1:48:17.164
Yeah.

1:48:19.208 --> 1:48:21.043
Sundance is disgusted.

1:48:21.168 --> 1:48:23.045
Shut up, both of you.

1:48:32.679 --> 1:48:34.515
Jackson.

1:48:35.557 --> 1:48:37.392
It's time son.

1:48:50.197 --> 1:48:52.866
We'll visit you all the time.

1:48:57.204 --> 1:48:58.539
Hey boy.

1:48:59.706 --> 1:49:00.541
Hey buddy.

1:49:04.211 --> 1:49:05.712
Three years, okay?

1:49:09.049 --> 1:49:11.218
Less then I deserve, anyway.

1:49:16.056 --> 1:49:19.726
We all meet again down
the road, all right?

1:49:21.270 --> 1:49:22.229
Be good.

1:49:28.735 --> 1:49:30.988
Dear mom and dad,

1:49:31.071 --> 1:49:33.240
the only think I ever
really wanted in my life

1:49:33.282 --> 1:49:36.076
was just to make
you proud of me.

1:49:38.245 --> 1:49:41.248
That's why I always
threw so hard.

1:49:42.249 --> 1:49:46.670
That's why I wanted to
ride just like Lucas.

1:49:46.753 --> 1:49:50.257
And that's why I made
that terrible mistake.

1:49:53.260 --> 1:49:56.805
I'm really sorry
I failed you guys.

1:49:56.930 --> 1:50:01.185
I don't know if I can fix
what I did down here, but,

1:50:01.268 --> 1:50:03.270
but I think I gotta try.

1:50:08.775 --> 1:50:13.030
So if I don't come back, please
take care of Lucas for me.

1:50:13.113 --> 1:50:17.784
Take care of the ranch and
take care of each other.

1:50:17.826 --> 1:50:18.994
Love you guys.

1:50:22.164 --> 1:50:23.290
Jackson.
