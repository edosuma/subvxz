17:59.339 --> 18:02.168
If you love her, you have to
fight for her.

18:02.211 --> 18:04.083
I've been there, I know.

18:04.126 --> 18:06.998
If you don't fight,
you're gonna be her slave.

18:09.740 --> 18:13.048
The thing is, Yaya, I like to
take you for dinner. I enjoy
paying for you.

18:13.092 --> 18:16.007
But there comes a point
where I do feel used.

18:16.791 --> 18:18.401
I use you?

18:18.445 --> 18:21.056
Well, I'm just referring to my
feelings now, but sure, if we...

18:21.100 --> 18:23.711
No, no. Just wait. If we go back
the last week or so,

18:23.754 --> 18:26.017
then, yeah, maybe there is a
point...

18:26.061 --> 18:27.715
Are you being serious?

18:27.758 --> 18:29.978
I got you this shirt.
I invited you for dinner.

18:30.021 --> 18:33.590
- You're staying at my hotel. -
Well, you got this shirt for
free.

18:33.634 --> 18:37.855
- And actually you didn't pay
for dinner. - That's because my
card didn't work.

18:37.899 --> 18:41.163
There's a cash machine in the
lobby. I'll pay you back every
last cent...

18:41.207 --> 18:43.078
It's okay.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.949
Carl, I always intended
to pay you back.

18:44.993 --> 18:49.128
I didn't realize you wanted the
money right now before going to
bed.

18:50.999 --> 18:53.784
- So your intention was to pay
me back? - Yes.

18:54.916 --> 18:56.483
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:56.526 --> 18:59.138
So why did you take
the 50-euro bill?

19:00.530 --> 19:04.230
Once I realized you didn't have
enough cash, I paid the bill.

19:04.273 --> 19:08.016
Instead of giving me the 50-euro
bill, you put it back in your
purse.

19:09.278 --> 19:11.802
What? I'm just saying what
happened, Yaya.

19:12.803 --> 19:14.501
What are you...? Don't!

19:16.677 --> 19:19.201
What the fuck are you doing?

19:19.245 --> 19:21.725
Don't fucking do that to me!

19:21.769 --> 19:24.989
Don't... fucking do that to me,
Yaya!

19:25.033 --> 19:27.514
Don't do that to me!

19:27.557 --> 19:30.517
- 'Going down.' - Don't fucking
shove things down me!

19:30.560 --> 19:32.127
- You fucking child!
- Seriously...

19:32.171 --> 19:33.346
You're behaving like a crazy
person.

19:33.389 --> 19:35.217
Shut up!
Don't do things like that to me!

19:35.261 --> 19:37.001
What the hell are you doing
with my money?

19:37.045 --> 19:40.657
Your money? Oh, my God!
It's not about money, Yaya!

19:40.701 --> 19:42.224
It's not about...

[Banging]

19:45.314 --> 19:47.534
It's not about the fucking
money, Yaya!

19:47.577 --> 19:49.405
- Oh!
- This is... No, it's not!

19:49.449 --> 19:52.234
You're not understanding the
point! It's not about the money!

19:52.278 --> 19:54.932
I'll give you that 50 euros!
I'll give you a 100 euros!

19:54.976 --> 19:57.152
- Oh, yeah?
- No! I'm serious now!

19:57.196 --> 19:59.937
This is not about the fucking
money! Why won't you understand
it?

19:59.981 --> 20:02.201
Understand my point!

20:02.984 --> 20:05.073
This is not about the money!

20:05.116 --> 20:09.077
- Oh, my God. Okay, okay.
- I want it to be equal, Yaya!

20:10.687 --> 20:13.908

dangerous, but he just looked

- Well, I'm back.

22:26.780 --> 22:29.043
What have you been doing?

22:29.086 --> 22:32.307
I was... walking up and down
the corridor and...

22:33.439 --> 22:36.050
- Texting you multiple times.
- Hmm, a lot...

22:36.964 --> 22:39.270
- You saw them?
- [Giggles] Yeah.

22:44.406 --> 22:46.669
- This is so silly.
- Yeah.

22:49.324 --> 22:52.153
I'm... so good at being...

22:52.980 --> 22:54.416
...manipulative.

22:56.462 --> 23:00.291
I don't know, I do it and I
don't even realize that I'm
doing it.

23:01.249 --> 23:03.425
- Yeah...
- I love you.

23:04.470 --> 23:08.430
No, but seriously, it's amazing
that you can tell me that.

23:08.474 --> 23:10.476
Now you're a generous person.

23:12.260 --> 23:13.609
Okay.

23:14.915 --> 23:16.264
Alright.

23:22.923 --> 23:24.751
Ask me anything.

23:24.794 --> 23:26.579
You sure?

Uh-huh.

In the restaurant, with the
bill...

23:33.629 --> 23:35.544
What about it?

23:35.588 --> 23:38.721
You intentionally
didn't pick that up, right?

23:38.765 --> 23:40.419
- Yes.
- Of course.

23:42.116 --> 23:43.987
[Yaya clears throat]

23:44.031 --> 23:46.425
Didn't that embarrass you?

23:47.469 --> 23:48.731
Nope.

23:50.385 --> 23:52.866
- But you make more money than I
do. - It's not about the money.

23:52.909 --> 23:54.911
And you said you were gonna
pay...

24:01.440 --> 24:04.617
It doesn't really matter
who makes more money.

24:04.660 --> 24:06.749
What is it about, then?

24:08.098 --> 24:09.665
What if I...

24:10.536 --> 24:12.494
...fall pregnant?

24:12.538 --> 24:13.974
With me?

24:15.454 --> 24:20.110
What if I fall pregnant
and I can't go on working?

24:20.154 --> 24:23.679
I need to know that the person
I'm with intends to take care of
me.

24:23.723 --> 24:25.725
Otherwise I'm wasting my time.

24:29.859 --> 24:32.819
Yeah, I guess you're not the
kind to work in...

24:32.862 --> 24:35.299
...a restaurant
or a supermarket, are you?

24:35.343 --> 24:37.476
- [Yaya laughs]
- No offense.

24:38.259 --> 24:40.609
I'm a model, honey, the only way
for me to get out of this life

24:40.653 --> 24:43.699
is to become
someone's trophy wife.

24:45.353 --> 24:48.008
So, there's nothing else to this
for you?

24:49.357 --> 24:50.619
Other than...

24:52.273 --> 24:55.450
...increasing the followers on
our Instagram, and all of that.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.974
- It make sense, doesn't it?
- Sure.

24:58.018 --> 25:00.847

It's good for business.

- Uh-hmm.

25:09.159 --> 25:11.422
I'd like to put a bet on that.

25:12.511 --> 25:13.816
Okay.

25:15.035 --> 25:16.645
- Deal.
- Yeah.

25:20.867 --> 25:22.346
We'll see.

25:23.609 --> 25:25.611
I'll make you love me.

25:27.134 --> 25:29.353
- It'll be real love as well.
- Oh, yeah?

25:29.397 --> 25:31.617
- Yep.
- Okay.

51:03.321 --> 51:07.281
- ...hmm... what would you wish
for? - I have no idea.

51:08.717 --> 51:12.721
- Have you been for a swim
today? - No, not today.

51:13.635 --> 51:16.986
Why don't you go for a swim
right now?

51:19.293 --> 51:22.296
Because this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

51:22.340 --> 51:25.908
That's so kind of you, madam,
but unfortunately we're not
allowed

51:25.952 --> 51:28.824
to go for a swim
during working hours, so...

51:28.868 --> 51:31.436
I want all the staff to go for a
swim!

51:31.479 --> 51:34.613
I want you all to go for a swim!

51:34.656 --> 51:39.835
I really feel that I've had
one of these moments.

51:39.879 --> 51:43.970
Yeah, well, today might be
a little bit problematic...

51:44.013 --> 51:45.276
Problematic?

51:45.319 --> 51:47.147
Cos today we have
the Captain's Dinner.

51:47.191 --> 51:51.456
Who cares about the Captain's
Dinner? This will only take half
an hour.

51:51.499 --> 51:53.458
Come on, now.

51:53.501 --> 51:55.764
You work too hard, come on.

51:57.201 --> 52:00.682
- Yeah, well, let me see what I
can do. - Merci!

52:10.910 --> 52:14.174
No, no, no! Come back!
Come back, please.

52:14.218 --> 52:17.786
Please come back.
I have a better idea.

52:18.657 --> 52:20.659
- Sit down.
- Okay.

52:22.226 --> 52:25.185
Let's reverse roles.

52:25.229 --> 52:28.406
- Sorry?
- Just change roles.

52:30.234 --> 52:34.586
You... chillax in the jacuzzi,
and I'll get the captain.

52:34.629 --> 52:36.153
Oh... well...

52:36.196 --> 52:40.113
Come on! Just be in the moment,
like I was. Please!

52:40.157 --> 52:42.594
- Yeah, but... - Come, come, I
know you want to.

52:42.637 --> 52:44.900
- Come on!
- Yes, I do but...

52:44.944 --> 52:47.120
But there might be
a problem for me, if I...

52:47.164 --> 52:50.036
Now I have to be the authority.

52:50.079 --> 52:52.778
- Yeah, well, I have my clothes
on... - Shut up, shut up, shut
up!

52:52.821 --> 52:54.388
Shut up! Now!

52:56.564 --> 53:00.177
I command you,
enjoy the moment!

53:03.354 --> 53:05.704
- N-now?
- Please.

53:10.448 --> 53:12.101
- No.
- No?

53:12.145 --> 53:14.060
- No.
- What?

53:15.148 --> 53:17.019
- You say "no" to me?
- No. No!

53:17.063 --> 53:18.717
- So it's "yes"?
- Yes... No.

53:18.760 --> 53:21.198
- "Yes" or "no"?
- I'm saying...

53:22.416 --> 53:24.288
Sorry, I'm saying, n...

53:25.114 --> 53:26.420
I'm saying...

53:27.465 --> 53:31.033
- Yes.
- Yes! Ha-ha!

53:31.077 --> 53:34.254
Don't worry.
Dimitrios will buy the yacht.

53:34.298 --> 53:36.387
Come on! Sit down, sit down.

53:36.430 --> 53:39.520

53:58.278 --> 54:00.933
[Paula] Darius? I need your
help.

54:00.976 --> 54:05.067
I need you tell one of the
guests that the crew can't go
for a swim.

54:05.111 --> 54:06.634
Why?

54:06.678 --> 54:08.636
Well, I told them it's not
possible because of the dinner,

54:08.680 --> 54:11.596
but they want to hear it
from the captain in person.

54:11.639 --> 54:14.338
So I went to Thomas' cabin,
I knocked on it, he's not there.

54:14.381 --> 54:17.166
He's not responding.
I can't get a hold of him, so...

54:17.210 --> 54:19.343
Could you just please go and
tell them it's not possible?

54:19.386 --> 54:22.607
- That would be a big help.
- Can't you just go for a swim?

54:22.650 --> 54:24.913
No. I mean,
that would be the easiest,

54:24.957 --> 54:27.873
but they want us to go
from the water slide and...

54:27.916 --> 54:31.093
It's not even funny.
Why are you laughing, Erik?

54:31.137 --> 54:33.487
- Why are you even here?
- I'm on my break.

54:33.531 --> 54:36.273
Well, your break is over.
Go back to work.

54:36.316 --> 54:39.885
It's not even installed yet, it
will take forever, and I don't
have that time.

54:39.928 --> 54:42.975
The chef has started the dinner,
I need the prep-time.

54:43.018 --> 54:44.846
So please go and tell them
it's not possible...

54:44.890 --> 54:47.240
I'm not going to go and talk
to some crazy Russians.

54:47.284 --> 54:49.677
It's not crazy Russians,
it's very rich Russians.

54:49.721 --> 54:50.939
Same thing.

54:50.983 --> 54:53.072
Go and solve this problem first,
and then...

54:53.115 --> 54:55.509
No! We're done.

54:55.553 --> 54:59.600
- Why won't you do this?
- Go and take a swim. Jesus...

54:59.644 --> 55:01.385
- Hello, sir!
- Hello.

55:01.428 --> 55:05.171
- Can I help you?
- I was just looking.

55:05.214 --> 55:07.347
- You want to see the bridge?
- If possible.

55:07.391 --> 55:11.308
Of course. I can get the First
Officer. He's not doing anything
right now.

55:12.352 --> 55:14.789
- Could you show the guest the
bridge? - Yes, of course.

55:14.833 --> 55:16.661
Welcome to the bridge.

- Yes, of course.

55:54.133 --> 55:57.354
Yesterday, I was up on the
sundeck.

55:57.397 --> 56:00.444
And the sun was shining,
everything was perfect.

56:00.487 --> 56:02.837
But then I looked at the sails.

56:02.881 --> 56:04.796
- The sails?
- Yes.

56:04.839 --> 56:07.451
And they were... a bit dirty.

You are going to swim.

and go to the main deck

possible, ma'am, because, er...

Yes, so I think it would be
better to eat something,

1:07:17.555 --> 1:07:20.253
because seasickness is worse
on an empty stomach.

What's she doing?

1:35:18.930 --> 1:35:21.759
What are you doing?
What's taking so long? Come on.

1:35:24.719 --> 1:35:27.809
Just wait a minute. Just back
up. Back up a bit.

1:35:28.810 --> 1:35:31.551
And the chips, Abigail.
Come on, everything out.

1:35:31.595 --> 1:35:34.206
[Dimitry] Paula, ask for food,
yeah?

1:35:34.250 --> 1:35:35.686
[Laughing]

1:35:37.383 --> 1:35:39.821
- And the Evian.
- Yes, ma'am Paula.

1:35:42.258 --> 1:35:44.521
[Paula] Thank you.
And how many are you?

1:35:44.564 --> 1:35:48.046
You're five? Just be patient.
Everyone will get...

1:35:49.004 --> 1:35:50.440
Here you go.

1:35:51.963 --> 1:35:53.443
There you go.

1:35:54.487 --> 1:35:56.011
Please save it.

1:36:05.716 --> 1:36:08.980
- [Jarmo] Are there more boxes
with water? - [Paula] No, this
is it.

1:36:09.024 --> 1:36:11.243
- [Man] What's this?
- [Paula] It's a facial spray.

1:36:11.287 --> 1:36:13.942
But you can drink it,
it's just water in a can.

1:36:15.073 --> 1:36:18.337
Keep it close to your mouth,
so you won't waste it.

1:36:22.820 --> 1:36:24.213
Here you go.

1:36:24.953 --> 1:36:26.955
[Therese shouting in distance]

1:36:49.586 --> 1:36:50.979
Okay?

1:37:17.353 --> 1:37:18.789
[Splashing]

1:37:28.103 --> 1:37:31.236
- [Whooping]
- [Dimitry] Bravo!

1:37:31.280 --> 1:37:34.152
- Bravo!
- Whoo!

1:37:35.893 --> 1:37:37.242
Crazy.

1:37:41.943 --> 1:37:46.382
- Did she catch that with her
hands? - [Paula] Good job,
Abigail!

1:37:47.949 --> 1:37:51.866
Good job! What is that? An
octopus?

1:37:51.909 --> 1:37:54.042
- [Abigail] Octopus.
- Good!

1:37:54.085 --> 1:37:57.175
- What do you think we should do
now? - Fucking impressive.

1:37:57.219 --> 1:38:02.180
- [Abigail] We need to make a
fire. - [Paula] Of course we
need to make a fire.

1:38:02.224 --> 1:38:03.529
Yes...

1:38:05.227 --> 1:38:08.143
Do any of you know
how to make a fire?

1:38:08.186 --> 1:38:09.405
What?

1:38:09.448 --> 1:38:13.278
Do any of you know
how to make a fire?

1:38:16.412 --> 1:38:17.892
- No?
- No!

1:38:18.805 --> 1:38:20.546
- What?
- No!

1:38:22.505 --> 1:38:25.247
Then you'll make the fire after
you're done fishing, and then we
should...

1:38:25.290 --> 1:38:28.554
- [Abigail] We need to clean the
octopus. - Of course we do.

1:38:32.689 --> 1:38:36.214
Do any of you know
how to clean an octopus?

1:38:36.258 --> 1:38:40.523
- [Dimitry] Huh?
- To clean an octopus!

1:38:40.566 --> 1:38:42.568
Do you know how to do it?

1:38:51.142 --> 1:38:53.188
[Abigail] Uh-huh...

1:39:03.415 --> 1:39:05.200
One for you.

1:39:06.201 --> 1:39:08.072
One for me.

1:39:08.116 --> 1:39:09.552
One for you.

1:39:10.335 --> 1:39:12.207
One for me.

1:39:12.250 --> 1:39:14.078
One for you.

1:39:14.122 --> 1:39:15.993
One for me.

1:39:16.037 --> 1:39:17.777
One for you.

1:39:17.821 --> 1:39:19.214
One for me.

1:39:20.084 --> 1:39:21.172
One for you.

1:39:21.956 --> 1:39:23.740
One for me.

1:39:23.783 --> 1:39:27.048
One for you. One for me.

1:39:27.570 --> 1:39:29.528
One for you.

1:39:29.572 --> 1:39:31.139
For me.

1:39:31.182 --> 1:39:33.184
For you. For me.

1:39:33.228 --> 1:39:35.795
For you.
For me.

1:39:37.275 --> 1:39:39.538
- Uh-huh!
- [Paula] What?

1:39:42.063 --> 1:39:43.716
What's that?

1:39:45.675 --> 1:39:47.590
That's mine.

1:39:47.633 --> 1:39:49.722
No, the big pile there?
What's that?

1:39:49.766 --> 1:39:52.116
Mine. It's mine.

1:39:52.160 --> 1:39:55.119
- All of this?
- Yes.

1:39:56.120 --> 1:40:00.081
No. No, no, no...
Why do you get so much food?

1:40:01.865 --> 1:40:03.040
Why?

1:40:05.129 --> 1:40:07.001
[Sighs heavily]

1:40:07.044 --> 1:40:08.915
I caught the fish.

1:40:09.655 --> 1:40:11.831
- Yes?
- I made the fire.

1:40:11.875 --> 1:40:13.746
- And?
- I cooked.

1:40:13.790 --> 1:40:17.837
I did all the work.
And everybody got something.

1:40:20.884 --> 1:40:22.190
Hmm...

1:40:23.104 --> 1:40:26.324
No. No, we all... we all worked.

1:40:26.368 --> 1:40:28.500
What did you do?

1:40:29.501 --> 1:40:33.114
We... gathered all the wood
for the fire.

1:40:33.157 --> 1:40:35.768
- [Abigail snorts]
- I moved the log.

1:40:35.812 --> 1:40:39.337
Yeah, this big log was over
there, and we moved it over
here.

1:40:39.381 --> 1:40:41.035
Not enough.

1:40:42.210 --> 1:40:45.430
[Paula] No, maybe not enough,
but we need to work together.

1:40:45.474 --> 1:40:49.565
- They don't know how to do
that. - Exactly.

1:40:51.436 --> 1:40:55.440
And maybe that's why you should
not be so lazy and dependent on
me.

1:40:55.484 --> 1:40:58.182
- [Dimitry mutters and chuckles]
- Uh-huh!

1:41:17.245 --> 1:41:20.857
Abigail...
I think you're forgetting

1:41:20.900 --> 1:41:24.600
that you and I are employees
of a big shipping company.

1:41:24.643 --> 1:41:26.515
Remember?

1:41:26.558 --> 1:41:30.127
In the end, I'm responsible
for the safety of the guests.

1:41:30.171 --> 1:41:32.086
You have to do what I say.

1:41:33.174 --> 1:41:36.873
We work on a yacht.
You are a toilet manager.

1:41:36.916 --> 1:41:39.745
- You don't know how to
handle... - What yacht?

1:41:39.789 --> 1:41:41.878
- [Dimitry laughs]
- Where's the yacht?

1:41:41.921 --> 1:41:44.968
You know this, Abigail,
I am a very rich man.

1:41:45.011 --> 1:41:48.624
When we get back,
I can do good things for you.

1:41:48.667 --> 1:41:51.105
I can make your life easy and
nice.

1:41:51.148 --> 1:41:53.585
- [Abigail] When we get back?
- Yeah.

1:41:53.629 --> 1:41:55.935
When we get back.
People are looking for us.

1:41:55.979 --> 1:41:59.069
What, you think that
we'll stay here forever? What?

1:41:59.113 --> 1:42:01.811
[Abigail laughs] You're funny.

1:42:01.854 --> 1:42:05.206
This is not how you were
trained, Abigail. Please give...

1:42:05.249 --> 1:42:07.295
[Dimitry] Whoa!

1:42:09.601 --> 1:42:12.082
[Paula] Come on, this is
ridiculous.

1:42:13.736 --> 1:42:16.956
You're scaring people.
Put the stick down.

1:42:18.219 --> 1:42:19.698
[Dimitry] Hey!

1:42:24.921 --> 1:42:26.531
Who am I?

1:42:27.967 --> 1:42:30.448
- [Paula] Who are you?
- Who am I?

1:42:30.492 --> 1:42:34.713
- You're the toilet manager.
- No.

1:42:34.757 --> 1:42:39.327
On the yacht, toilet manager.
Here... captain. Who am I?

1:42:43.548 --> 1:42:45.550
You're the captain.

1:42:47.291 --> 1:42:48.466
Yes.

1:42:51.513 --> 1:42:54.168
- Who am I?
- Captain.

1:42:54.211 --> 1:42:57.214
- [Abigail] Very good. Cutie
pie? - Captain.

1:42:58.128 --> 1:43:00.565
- Who am I?
- Captain.

1:43:00.609 --> 1:43:02.437
- Who am I?
- The captain.

1:43:03.307 --> 1:43:05.440
- Who am I?
- [Mutters]

1:43:09.400 --> 1:43:10.706
Who am I?

1:43:12.925 --> 1:43:14.536
Who am I?

1:43:23.980 --> 1:43:26.983
In the yacht, cleaning lady.
Here, captain.

1:43:27.940 --> 1:43:29.333
Okay?

1:43:32.467 --> 1:43:33.772
[Dimitry chuckles]

1:43:43.608 --> 1:43:45.654
[Abigail] Have one more.

1:43:45.697 --> 1:43:47.133
Thank you.

1:43:48.265 --> 1:43:50.311
[Dimitry] I would say, I agree.

1:43:50.354 --> 1:43:54.184
I mean, er...
we have to work together.

1:43:55.272 --> 1:43:58.710
And... create a good group.

1:43:58.754 --> 1:44:00.321
Good society.

1:44:00.364 --> 1:44:02.975
Do you know the saying,

1:44:03.019 --> 1:44:06.327
"From each according to his
ability,

1:44:06.370 --> 1:44:09.243
"to each according to his
needs"?

1:44:12.289 --> 1:44:14.378
You don't know this?

1:44:15.597 --> 1:44:17.251
Ma'am Paula...

1:44:20.210 --> 1:44:25.607
With respect to your expertise
in this situation...

1:44:27.304 --> 1:44:31.003
...I would like to make a
suggestion, if that's okay?

1:44:32.396 --> 1:44:33.832
Sure.

1:44:36.400 --> 1:44:39.403
My suggestion is that
the boys...

1:44:40.796 --> 1:44:45.670
stay here and watch the fire,
and take care of madame.

1:44:45.714 --> 1:44:51.285
While you, ma'am Paula, and you
sleep with me in the lifeboat.

1:44:55.637 --> 1:44:57.291
[Animal barks]

1:45:01.686 --> 1:45:03.209
[Barking]

1:45:05.560 --> 1:45:07.213
[Closer barking]

1:45:18.486 --> 1:45:19.835
Thank you.

1:45:25.362 --> 1:45:26.842
[Knocking]

1:45:26.885 --> 1:45:29.192
[Dimitry] Hey, Abigail, look
this...

1:45:30.193 --> 1:45:32.500
[Jarmo] I would give you
my Patek Philippe.

1:45:32.543 --> 1:45:35.024
[Dimitry] For one night in the
boat. Hey, Abigail...

1:45:35.067 --> 1:45:37.505
- [Jarmo] 150 thousand euros!
- [Abigail laughs]

1:45:38.723 --> 1:45:42.597
- [Jarmo] Let us in. - [Dimitry]
For you... original Rolex.

1:45:49.517 --> 1:45:53.042
Nelson... she left the bag.

1:45:53.999 --> 1:45:56.306
- What?
- She left the bag.

1:45:59.527 --> 1:46:01.790
[Nelson] What's in it?

1:46:12.453 --> 1:46:14.629
[Carl] Pretzel sticks.

1:46:19.416 --> 1:46:23.464
- No, we can't have it. - I'm
just gonna have a look. Alright?

1:46:29.383 --> 1:46:32.516
- Nice!
- [Carl] We can't. No.

1:46:32.560 --> 1:46:34.257
[Zips up bag]

1:46:40.568 --> 1:46:42.308
- Wait...
- What are you doing?

1:46:42.352 --> 1:46:43.788
Wait, wait, wait...

1:46:50.534 --> 1:46:51.970
Maybe...

1:46:54.930 --> 1:46:57.628
...if we just make a little hole
here...

1:46:58.499 --> 1:47:03.852
Take two out. One each.
They'll never notice it.

1:47:03.895 --> 1:47:05.810
[Carl] Okay, let me try.

1:47:09.553 --> 1:47:11.816
- Stop it, stop it, stop it...
- Now?

1:47:24.525 --> 1:47:26.570
That was perfect!

1:47:29.051 --> 1:47:32.184
- I don't wanna eat it! I wanna
save it! - [Nelson] So good!

1:47:34.230 --> 1:47:35.971
[Carl] Put it back.

1:47:53.075 --> 1:47:54.380
[Carl] Hmm...

1:48:00.778 --> 1:48:03.085
- Shall we just have one more?
- Yeah.

1:48:03.128 --> 1:48:04.347
Yeah!

1:48:16.228 --> 1:48:17.621
Vera!

1:48:22.887 --> 1:48:24.323
[Weeping]

1:48:54.571 --> 1:48:56.617
[Crow cawing]

1:49:22.381 --> 1:49:24.688
So, what happened here?

1:49:24.732 --> 1:49:27.517
Er... we made a mistake with...

1:49:29.171 --> 1:49:31.129
[Abigail] Why?

1:49:31.173 --> 1:49:33.305
We just fell asleep.

1:49:33.349 --> 1:49:37.614
Now I won't have enough time to
go fish, because I have to make
another fire.

1:49:39.050 --> 1:49:42.010
It takes a lot of work
to make a fire, you know.

1:49:42.053 --> 1:49:43.794
Yeah, yeah. We know.

1:49:47.668 --> 1:49:49.670
[Inaudible whispering]

1:49:56.285 --> 1:49:57.460
[Sighs]

1:50:00.332 --> 1:50:01.986
[Abigail] Okay.

1:50:03.901 --> 1:50:07.209
Okay. Okay, okay.
Let's get this day started.

1:50:07.252 --> 1:50:09.385
Come on, everybody. Let's go.

1:50:11.213 --> 1:50:12.910
- Okay.
- Cool.

1:50:12.954 --> 1:50:15.957
[Abigail] Wait, wait, wait.
There's one more thing.

1:50:17.698 --> 1:50:21.963
Because, last night,
we left our backpack here,

1:50:22.006 --> 1:50:25.314
and, well,
we're not very sure, but...

1:50:25.357 --> 1:50:28.796
...we think we're missing
a pack of pretzel sticks.

1:50:30.014 --> 1:50:32.538
- You didn't take it, did you?
- No.

1:50:32.582 --> 1:50:33.975
No.

1:50:36.325 --> 1:50:38.501
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, we're sure! Come on.

1:50:38.544 --> 1:50:41.983
- Why are we being accused?
- Oh, no, I'm not accusing you.

1:50:42.026 --> 1:50:44.202
I'm just making sure, because...

1:50:50.687 --> 1:50:51.949
What's this?

1:50:54.038 --> 1:50:55.823
- Well, we didn't...
- You didn't?

1:50:55.866 --> 1:50:57.302
- No.
- No, we didn't.

1:50:57.346 --> 1:51:00.131
- And you're sure you didn't?
- We are sure we didn't.

1:51:00.175 --> 1:51:02.003
- Very sure?
- Yes.

1:51:05.310 --> 1:51:08.879
- I think they need to be
punished. - Yes, ma'am Paula.

1:51:11.795 --> 1:51:14.189
This is really bad.

1:51:14.232 --> 1:51:16.582
This is really, really bad.

1:51:17.671 --> 1:51:19.585
[Carl] Oh, come on...

1:51:19.629 --> 1:51:21.718
I mean, you didn't watch the
fire.

1:51:21.762 --> 1:51:24.242
And then you steal
a pack of pretzel sticks?

1:51:24.286 --> 1:51:27.115
- Yeah, and lie about it.
- We deserved it.

1:51:27.158 --> 1:51:30.205
[Abigail] And not just to me,
to everybody here.

1:51:32.076 --> 1:51:34.296
How can we trust you,
after what you did?

1:51:34.339 --> 1:51:36.733
I need to say something now,
because this is becoming
ridiculous.

1:51:36.777 --> 1:51:41.129
- No, let me say something,
Abigail. - [Abigail] Did you see
that?

1:51:41.172 --> 1:51:42.957
What?

1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:46.047
Don't point at her.
Put your hands down.

1:51:47.483 --> 1:51:50.965
- Okay, alright, Just let me
say, though... - [Abigail] Put
your hands down!

1:51:51.705 --> 1:51:53.141
What?

1:51:53.184 --> 1:51:56.013
[Yaya] Your body language
is so aggressive, Carl!

1:51:56.057 --> 1:51:59.190
- What? - [Abigail] I'm not
getting any food for you.

1:51:59.234 --> 1:52:02.803
- You find your own food.
- What? Come on, man...

1:52:02.846 --> 1:52:06.241
- No, Abigail, that's so unfair!
- Put your hands down.

1:52:06.284 --> 1:52:09.635
You seriously don't get it.
Put your hands down!

1:52:09.679 --> 1:52:13.378
- I'm trying to defend myself.
- Don't defend yourself!

1:52:13.422 --> 1:52:17.339
You are inflicting pain on her
by defending yourself.

1:52:35.270 --> 1:52:37.881
Shut the fuck up! No...

1:52:40.405 --> 1:52:41.798
No!

1:53:09.434 --> 1:53:11.741
[Dimitry] Hey! Ha-ha!

1:53:13.047 --> 1:53:15.919
Oh... hey.

1:53:16.920 --> 1:53:19.836
- What a nice fish, huh?
- Yes.

1:53:19.880 --> 1:53:21.969
- Wow!
- We have a lot.

1:53:23.013 --> 1:53:25.537
So it's dinner, huh? Great.

1:53:27.322 --> 1:53:30.804
- Where did you get it? - There,
at the back of the rock.

1:53:32.196 --> 1:53:34.938
- You're good at that.
- Thank you.

1:53:38.724 --> 1:53:40.204
You need help?

1:53:40.248 --> 1:53:43.512
Yeah, sure, get some Nutella.
[Laughs]

1:54:05.839 --> 1:54:07.666
Oh, thank you!

1:55:27.442 --> 1:55:29.270
[Yaya] What?

1:55:40.803 --> 1:55:44.285
- Yaya? Wait, wait!
- Dickhead! Piss off!

1:55:44.328 --> 1:55:46.156
[Metallic clanging]

1:56:01.128 --> 1:56:02.564
[Sighs]

1:56:06.089 --> 1:56:09.440
[Abigail] Okay, I'm going
to the lifeboat now.

1:56:09.484 --> 1:56:12.574
Ma'am Paula, can you stay here
and watch the fire?

1:56:12.617 --> 1:56:14.010
Sure.

1:56:16.970 --> 1:56:21.757
And since Carl didn't eat
anything today, he can sleep
with me in the lifeboat.

1:56:23.889 --> 1:56:25.369
Okay. Yeah.

1:56:27.850 --> 1:56:29.417
[Dimitry chuckles]

1:56:30.984 --> 1:56:34.857
- [Nelson] Can I come? - [Carl]
Abigail, can we both come or...?

1:56:34.900 --> 1:56:37.120
[Abigail] No, just you.

1:56:40.341 --> 1:56:44.084
- [Yaya] Fine, I'll take the
pretzels! - [Carl] Eh?

1:56:48.653 --> 1:56:50.568
You're making this into an
issue.

1:56:50.612 --> 1:56:52.831
Are you going to take them?
Yes, take them. Good.

1:56:52.875 --> 1:56:56.096
- Why are you making this into
an issue? - [Whistle blowing]

1:56:56.139 --> 1:56:58.228
I'm coming! One second!

1:57:04.408 --> 1:57:08.064
- What are you gonna do on the
boat? - I don't know.

1:57:09.892 --> 1:57:11.633
Don't act naive, seriously!

1:57:11.676 --> 1:57:13.852
I don't know why she asked me,
but I'm gonna do it, of
course...

1:57:13.896 --> 1:57:15.376
- Really?
- Yes.

1:57:15.419 --> 1:57:17.943
What do you think she wants with
you?

1:57:17.987 --> 1:57:20.642
You're a young, hot guy. What do
you think she's going to do with
you?

1:57:20.685 --> 1:57:22.252
[Whistle blowing]

1:57:22.296 --> 1:57:24.646
- Okay, then give them back...
- No. No!

1:57:24.689 --> 1:57:27.649
- Let me take them back.
- No. And they're mine, okay?

1:57:27.692 --> 1:57:30.217
Take a few, and I'll take them
back, cos I don't wanna do this.

1:57:30.260 --> 1:57:32.175
- It's not a good idea.
- I want these!

1:57:32.219 --> 1:57:36.658
You need to tell me what to do!
You need to tell me how to
navigate this.

1:57:36.701 --> 1:57:38.355
[Whistle blowing]

1:57:42.403 --> 1:57:43.752
Yaya?

1:57:47.538 --> 1:57:50.106
You just have to stroke her ego.

1:57:53.240 --> 1:57:56.634
Just... laugh at her jokes.

1:57:56.678 --> 1:57:59.072
- And... and smile.
- Mm-hmm...

1:58:00.247 --> 1:58:01.596
Okay.

1:58:01.639 --> 1:58:04.555
- Make sure to set up
boundaries. - Yeah.

1:58:04.599 --> 1:58:08.472
- And nothing sexual, okay? -
No, I won't do anything sexual.

1:58:09.169 --> 1:58:10.561
Mm-hmm...

1:58:10.605 --> 1:58:12.302
And don't do anything
you wouldn't want me to do.

1:58:12.346 --> 1:58:14.565
No, I won't do anything
you're not comfortable with.

1:58:14.609 --> 1:58:17.525
No kissing. Nothing like that!

1:58:21.877 --> 1:58:23.966
Yaya, I think she's probably
expecting something.

1:58:25.794 --> 1:58:28.884
- Like what?
- I don't know... I, er...

1:58:30.146 --> 1:58:31.974
- A massage, or...
- A massage?

1:58:32.017 --> 1:58:34.977
- I don't know. She might want
something. - Definitely not a
massage!

1:58:35.020 --> 1:58:37.458
She just gave me a whole fucking
packet of pretzels for you...

1:58:37.501 --> 1:58:39.938
I don't know what to say...
I can't do anything?

1:58:39.982 --> 1:58:41.679
- No!
- Okay, but...

1:58:41.723 --> 1:58:44.552
- Massage her neck. Okay?
- I can massage her neck?

1:58:44.595 --> 1:58:46.989
- Her neck, that's it!
- Okay, okay, okay...

1:58:49.383 --> 1:58:51.124
Okay.

1:58:53.256 --> 1:58:55.693
- I love you so much.
- Well, I hate you.

1:58:55.737 --> 1:58:58.131
I understand! Fuck...

1:58:58.914 --> 1:59:01.482
- [Whistle blowing]
- Yeah... Coming!

1:59:05.877 --> 1:59:07.488
[Yaya weeping]

1:59:19.413 --> 1:59:21.415
- See you in a bit.
- Morning.

1:59:22.503 --> 1:59:24.853
- Oh, morning.
- Asshole.

1:59:26.376 --> 1:59:29.162
Yaya!
Yaya, wait. Wait.

1:59:36.299 --> 1:59:39.172
- [Dimitry] Hey, you!
- [Indistinct voices]

2:00:12.335 --> 2:00:14.642
- See you later.
- [Abigail] Okay.

2:00:14.685 --> 2:00:18.167
[Man] Pirate! Pirate! He's
coming! He got caught!

2:00:18.211 --> 2:00:19.516
[Laughing]

2:00:20.256 --> 2:00:21.779
[Blows whistle]

2:00:23.172 --> 2:00:24.869
Disgusting.

2:00:24.913 --> 2:00:26.871
What?

2:00:38.579 --> 2:00:40.624
[Carl] What the fuck?

2:00:41.756 --> 2:00:43.714
Oh, fucking hell...

2:00:49.894 --> 2:00:51.374
[Banging]

2:00:52.767 --> 2:00:53.898
[Whistle blowing]

2:00:55.726 --> 2:00:57.598
[Chuckling]

2:00:58.163 --> 2:00:59.817
[Blows whistle]

2:01:01.471 --> 2:01:04.344
- Pretty boy!
- We can see you!

2:01:15.703 --> 2:01:19.097
Have you ever used your...
when you were young?

2:01:21.970 --> 2:01:24.233
Oh, you slept with somebody
to get a job?

2:01:35.418 --> 2:01:37.420
No, you didn't?

2:01:37.464 --> 2:01:40.162
Really? Once?

2:01:40.205 --> 2:01:42.207
[Nelson speaks French]

2:01:45.515 --> 2:01:48.257
Therese... Wow!

2:01:50.868 --> 2:01:52.348
[Blows whistle]

2:01:53.349 --> 2:01:55.482
[Carl] Where is it?

2:01:55.525 --> 2:01:58.702
- Give it to me!
- Take it! Take it.

2:02:02.010 --> 2:02:04.926
You're acting like children.
Give me the whistle!

2:02:04.969 --> 2:02:06.971
Give me the whistle now!

2:02:09.626 --> 2:02:11.367
So childish!

2:02:11.411 --> 2:02:13.456
[Dimitry mimics whistle]

2:02:34.347 --> 2:02:36.697
[Animal braying and snorting]

2:02:41.310 --> 2:02:42.877
Hey...

2:02:42.920 --> 2:02:45.445
- Pirate? What was it?
- Did you see it?

2:02:45.488 --> 2:02:48.056
- What was it?
- I don't know what it is.

2:02:51.842 --> 2:02:55.368
- What's going on?
- They're hunting something.

2:02:59.763 --> 2:03:03.985
[Nelson] No. We don't go there.
What?

2:03:04.028 --> 2:03:06.117
- Come on, guys!
- Shh!

2:03:12.776 --> 2:03:14.909
Nelson, give me that.

2:03:16.911 --> 2:03:19.174
[Nelson] Are you sure?

2:03:33.231 --> 2:03:34.885
[Animal braying]

2:03:37.061 --> 2:03:38.454
Fuck...

2:03:45.287 --> 2:03:47.028
It's a female.

2:03:48.203 --> 2:03:49.726
Kill it.

2:03:51.293 --> 2:03:53.251
[Animal braying]

2:04:02.130 --> 2:04:04.219
[Jarmo shouts]

2:04:07.004 --> 2:04:09.398
- Whoo!
- Ya!

2:04:09.442 --> 2:04:11.444
[Men shouting]

2:04:15.056 --> 2:04:17.928
It's moving. It's moving.

2:04:17.972 --> 2:04:20.670
- What?
- It's not dead. It's not dead.

2:04:20.714 --> 2:04:23.891
- It's moving.
- It's not dead.

2:04:23.934 --> 2:04:26.197
[Braying]

2:04:27.024 --> 2:04:29.113
- [Nelson] What's he doing?
- [Paula] No, no, no.

2:04:30.680 --> 2:04:32.639
[Nelson] Ah, again! Do it again!

2:04:32.682 --> 2:04:35.032
[Braying in pain]

2:04:38.079 --> 2:04:40.429
[Thudding and braying]

2:04:43.476 --> 2:04:46.696
Jarmo! Jarmo... la tempe.

2:04:48.655 --> 2:04:50.483
[Breathing heavily]

2:04:54.661 --> 2:04:56.576
Hey, you did it!

2:05:06.934 --> 2:05:11.765
Hunter Jarmo! Big hunter! Come
on!

2:05:11.808 --> 2:05:16.421
- Give him applause! Hey! - [All
chant] Jarmo! Jarmo! Jarmo...

2:05:18.685 --> 2:05:22.602
- [Dimitry] Big donkey hunt!
- Come on, speech!

2:05:22.645 --> 2:05:25.996
- [Jarmo] Okay, okay!
- The donkey fairytale...

2:05:26.040 --> 2:05:28.999
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!
- [Jarmo] Thank you very much.

2:05:29.043 --> 2:05:34.962
Okay... To kill a donkey,
it may be a great achievement.

2:05:35.005 --> 2:05:38.008
But there's one thing
that's so much greater.

2:05:38.052 --> 2:05:41.446
- [Yaya] To paint!
- To paint, yes!

2:05:42.186 --> 2:05:45.233
To paint a donkey!

2:05:45.276 --> 2:05:48.018
- [Yaya] Yes!
- [All cheering]

2:05:49.193 --> 2:05:50.543
[Whooping]

2:05:51.282 --> 2:05:53.458
[Jarmo] Let's take a look
at the expression.

2:05:53.502 --> 2:05:56.026
- Who did this one?
- [Yaya] Me.

2:05:56.070 --> 2:05:59.421
Okay, the feet are close, close
together.

2:05:59.464 --> 2:06:02.816
This donkey wants to be in
control.

2:06:02.859 --> 2:06:06.254
But it looks almost scared.

2:06:07.124 --> 2:06:09.387
You want to tell this donkey
to...

2:06:10.475 --> 2:06:12.303
...to not be so scared.

2:06:12.347 --> 2:06:17.352
To lose control and bound away
across the fields,

2:06:17.395 --> 2:06:20.224
wildly waving its tail!

2:06:21.312 --> 2:06:24.707
- Sure, it will make mistakes...
- Carl, what are you doing?

2:06:28.668 --> 2:06:29.886
Huh?

2:06:31.453 --> 2:06:33.498
- [Yaya] Carl?
- Yeah.

2:06:36.110 --> 2:06:38.329
What are you doing with your
hand?

2:06:41.115 --> 2:06:44.074
- [Carl] Which one?
- Seriously?

2:06:48.731 --> 2:06:50.951
I'm just resting it on the
chair.

2:06:53.170 --> 2:06:56.391
Why is your hand
under her jacket on a chair?

2:06:58.132 --> 2:06:59.612
[Carl] What...?

2:07:00.656 --> 2:07:02.832
It was just...
I don't know, it was there,

2:07:02.876 --> 2:07:05.618
resting on the side of... the
chair.

2:07:20.937 --> 2:07:22.373
[Distant thunder]

2:07:28.728 --> 2:07:31.644
[Abigail] I'm coming.
I'm coming!

2:07:33.080 --> 2:07:34.734
I'm coming...

2:07:34.777 --> 2:07:37.519
- Oh, I can't concentrate...
- Oh, God!

2:07:53.622 --> 2:07:55.580
Okay, you know...

2:07:55.624 --> 2:07:59.193
...if you can't handle it, just
tell me, nobody's forcing you to
do anything.

2:07:59.236 --> 2:08:03.284
It's just all this fucking
sneaking around and hiding
things from everyone.

2:08:03.327 --> 2:08:06.591
It's too much. It's... it's
becoming unbearable.

2:08:06.635 --> 2:08:10.378
I mean, they're obviously not
happy with what we're doing in
here.

2:08:12.902 --> 2:08:17.254
Okay, so... Let's just... tell
them the truth.

2:08:20.693 --> 2:08:25.915
You give me something, and I
give you something in return.

2:08:31.094 --> 2:08:33.706
You realize what position
that puts me in?

2:08:34.837 --> 2:08:36.056
No.

2:08:37.840 --> 2:08:41.931
Well, just because it's more
open that you're a flesh
peddler,

2:08:41.975 --> 2:08:43.803
it doesn't mean
they're gonna accept the fact

2:08:43.846 --> 2:08:46.501
that you're buying sex
with the common food.

2:08:47.241 --> 2:08:49.025
Wow...

2:08:50.200 --> 2:08:51.767
Oh, come on, I didn't...

2:08:51.811 --> 2:08:54.204
Do you know the amount of work
I put into this island?

2:08:54.248 --> 2:08:57.381
- I go fishing every day, I make
fire... - I know, I know.

2:08:57.425 --> 2:08:59.949
- I'm responsible for everybody
here! - I know, I'm sorry, I
know.

2:08:59.993 --> 2:09:04.084
- Shouldn't that give me an
advantage? - Yeah, yeah, of
course.

2:09:04.127 --> 2:09:07.783
- Okay! - You deserve to do what
you want, I know.

2:09:15.835 --> 2:09:18.794
The absurd thing is that,
if we were a couple,

2:09:18.838 --> 2:09:21.666
they wouldn't care
what we did in here.

2:09:24.582 --> 2:09:28.412
But, really, maybe we should
just do that, maybe we should
just get on with it.

2:09:28.456 --> 2:09:31.372
I don't know, kiss a little bit
in public and hold hands.

2:09:31.415 --> 2:09:34.114
- Surely that would be easier?
- What about Yaya?

2:09:34.157 --> 2:09:38.248
I would have a conversation with
Yaya. I would have to be an
adult about it.

2:09:38.292 --> 2:09:42.992
And figure it out, but... I
think it would be easier for
her, probably.

2:09:43.036 --> 2:09:45.778
I mean, she's having to deal
with all this gossip as well.

2:09:45.821 --> 2:09:48.041
Carl, I... I don't know.

2:09:56.701 --> 2:09:59.052
Do you want me
to break up with Yaya?

2:09:59.095 --> 2:10:00.749
- No.
- No?

2:10:02.925 --> 2:10:05.449
That's your decision, not mine.

2:10:08.322 --> 2:10:12.413
I'm not asking you to do it, I'm
just seeing what you think about
it.

2:10:12.456 --> 2:10:16.069
I know, but that doesn't mean
that you can put me in-between
the two of you.

2:10:16.112 --> 2:10:17.592
Okay, okay.

2:10:25.948 --> 2:10:28.472
It's kind of a perfect scenario
for you, I mean...

2:10:30.083 --> 2:10:32.346
You get what you want,
you have no obligations,

2:10:32.389 --> 2:10:34.696
no responsibilities, you know.

2:10:34.739 --> 2:10:36.872
Why do you have to make
everything so complicated?

2:10:36.916 --> 2:10:40.354
Because I feel like I need to
know where this is going,
Abigail.

2:10:42.878 --> 2:10:44.880
Let's just have fun.

2:10:44.924 --> 2:10:47.187
No, but I need to try to deal
with this situation.

2:10:47.230 --> 2:10:49.232
I... I don't wanna piss off...

2:10:51.582 --> 2:10:53.846
I don't wanna annoy anyone
anymore.

2:10:56.152 --> 2:10:59.939
Do you remember what you said
the first night you were here?

2:10:59.982 --> 2:11:01.766
What did you say?

2:11:03.899 --> 2:11:06.684
"I love you, you give me fish."

2:11:06.728 --> 2:11:08.338
Exactly.

2:11:08.382 --> 2:11:11.733
And do you know why
that is so beautiful?

2:11:11.776 --> 2:11:13.300
- No.
- Like you...

2:11:13.343 --> 2:11:15.737
- Why?
- Because it's the truth.

2:11:20.960 --> 2:11:23.876
So, Nelson... you're a pirate,
huh?

2:11:25.442 --> 2:11:27.183
Come on, stop it.

2:11:29.359 --> 2:11:32.623
Okay. If I was a pirate,
what would you ask me?

2:11:32.667 --> 2:11:35.017
How much money do you make?

2:11:36.410 --> 2:11:38.238
Yeah, of course.

2:11:38.281 --> 2:11:41.632
I don't know, like... 3,000
euros.

2:11:41.676 --> 2:11:43.896
- On one attack?
- Yeah, one attack.

2:11:44.853 --> 2:11:46.507
If we succeed.

2:11:47.551 --> 2:11:50.641
So, you work on commission, huh?

2:11:50.685 --> 2:11:52.643
- Yeah.
- Shit!

2:11:52.687 --> 2:11:54.907
The client is making all money?

2:11:55.820 --> 2:11:59.085
Yeah, but you can make more
if you have your own boat.

2:12:01.565 --> 2:12:05.047
3,000 euros...
Come on, you're crazy.

2:12:06.092 --> 2:12:08.529
My girlfriend is expensive.

2:12:08.572 --> 2:12:11.271
What? You invest in your
girlfriend?

2:12:11.314 --> 2:12:13.360
- Yeah.
- Ah...

2:12:13.403 --> 2:12:16.015
You should do it
the other way around.

2:12:16.058 --> 2:12:19.409
Invest in business, buy a boat,
and the girls will come to you.

2:12:19.453 --> 2:12:20.541
Yeah?

2:12:21.281 --> 2:12:23.587
[Dimitry] Sure, I know. Ha-ha!

2:12:23.631 --> 2:12:25.372
[Knocking]

2:12:34.381 --> 2:12:36.339
[Insistent knocking]

2:12:39.386 --> 2:12:41.214
Hey.

2:12:41.257 --> 2:12:44.173
I was just wondering
if I could borrow the backpack.

2:12:44.217 --> 2:12:46.915
- Abigail?
- [Abigail] Yeah, I know.

2:12:46.959 --> 2:12:50.266
- What are you going to do,
Yaya? - Go for a hike over the
mountain.

2:12:50.310 --> 2:12:52.486
See if I can find something.

2:12:55.750 --> 2:12:59.580
- [Abigail] I'll go with you.
- It's okay, I can go by myself.

2:12:59.623 --> 2:13:03.453
No, Yaya, it's not safe for you
to go alone. I'll go with you.

2:13:04.933 --> 2:13:06.326
Okay.

2:13:10.808 --> 2:13:14.899
- Do you want me to come?
- No. You stay here.

2:13:14.943 --> 2:13:16.989
I need some time alone with her.

2:13:17.032 --> 2:13:18.512
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

2:13:24.605 --> 2:13:26.346
[Yaya] I'll take it.

2:13:54.287 --> 2:13:56.506
I'm glad we're doing this
together, Yaya.

2:13:58.552 --> 2:13:59.988
Me, too.

2:14:00.858 --> 2:14:03.383
I actually wanted
to tell you that I'm...

2:14:03.426 --> 2:14:06.255
...really impressed by
everything you're doing here.

2:14:07.169 --> 2:14:10.999
I mean, you managed to run
a fucking matriarchy, Abigail.

2:14:11.043 --> 2:14:12.435
[Laughing]

2:14:18.746 --> 2:14:21.879
You domesticated
all the old alpha males.

2:14:21.923 --> 2:14:23.316
Yeah!

2:14:26.188 --> 2:14:27.537
Thank you.

2:14:31.454 --> 2:14:33.456
No, it's really impressive.

2:14:41.595 --> 2:14:44.032
We should stick together, huh?

2:15:09.840 --> 2:15:11.494
Oh, my God...

2:15:14.497 --> 2:15:17.239
I think it should be
a little easier from here.

2:15:38.434 --> 2:15:40.871

2:16:54.554 --> 2:16:56.599
[Therese] Nein, nein.

2:16:58.732 --> 2:17:00.212
[Man] Huh?

2:17:46.780 --> 2:17:48.738
[Yaya] Abigail!

2:17:48.782 --> 2:17:50.218
Yeah?

2:17:51.350 --> 2:17:53.265
[Yaya] I see something!

2:17:56.920 --> 2:17:59.923
- [Yaya shouts]
- A what?

2:18:01.795 --> 2:18:04.711
- [Yaya shouts]
- I can't hear you!

2:18:07.931 --> 2:18:11.065
- [Yaya] Abigail! Hurry up!
- I'm coming!

2:18:12.284 --> 2:18:14.547
- Abigail!
- Yaya!

2:18:16.810 --> 2:18:20.292
- [Yaya whooping]
- Yaya!

2:18:20.335 --> 2:18:21.728
Abigail!

2:18:23.425 --> 2:18:26.907
Abigail!
Abigail, there's an elevator!

2:18:29.649 --> 2:18:32.042
- It's a resort, Abigail!
- A what?

2:18:32.086 --> 2:18:33.740
It's a resort!

2:18:37.396 --> 2:18:41.400
Come, look! It's a luxury
resort!

2:18:41.443 --> 2:18:43.053
[Laughing]

2:18:45.839 --> 2:18:48.189
It's been there the whole time!

2:18:48.232 --> 2:18:51.410
It's been there
the whole fucking time, Abigail!

2:18:54.804 --> 2:18:56.806
[Weeping and laughing]

2:19:05.380 --> 2:19:06.686
Come.

2:19:09.863 --> 2:19:13.040
Come, Abigail. Come.

2:19:20.613 --> 2:19:22.005
Abigail?

2:19:24.312 --> 2:19:26.488
Let's enjoy this moment.

2:20:01.523 --> 2:20:03.960
- It's surreal, huh?
- Yeah.

2:20:18.497 --> 2:20:20.890
You must be excited
to see your kids, huh?

2:20:20.934 --> 2:20:22.457
[Laughs]

2:20:22.501 --> 2:20:25.417
- I don't have kids.
- Ah...

2:20:27.114 --> 2:20:28.507
Sorry.

2:20:30.160 --> 2:20:31.814
[Elevator bell chimes]

2:20:39.300 --> 2:20:40.693
Let's go.

2:20:42.738 --> 2:20:44.348
I need to wee-wee.

2:20:45.132 --> 2:20:47.221
- Yeah.
- And then we will go.

2:20:47.264 --> 2:20:48.570
Okay.

2:21:56.159 --> 2:21:57.552
Abigail?

2:22:02.035 --> 2:22:04.298
Abigail, I can try and help you.

2:22:06.430 --> 2:22:08.650
I don't know how, but...

2:22:13.089 --> 2:22:17.529
Abigail... maybe you can come
and work for me?

2:22:18.181 --> 2:22:20.183
You could be my assistant.

2:22:27.451 --> 2:22:28.844
Aargh!
