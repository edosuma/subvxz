00:03.440 --> 00:05.879
<i>'Twas the night
before Trashmas,</i>

00:05.879 --> 00:07.782
<i>and all through the yard,</i>

00:07.782 --> 00:09.620
<i>not a creature was stirring</i>

00:09.620 --> 00:12.091
<i>save for one Saint Bernard.</i>

00:12.091 --> 00:14.963
Merry Trashmas!

00:14.963 --> 00:17.602
Oh, how can it still be dark?

00:17.602 --> 00:18.303
Honey, wake up!

00:18.303 --> 00:20.073
Ugh, go to sleep, Chief.

00:20.073 --> 00:21.376
Aah, I can't!

00:21.376 --> 00:24.181
Ah, Trashmas is
my favorite holiday.

00:24.181 --> 00:27.756
All those beautiful
overflowing garbage cans

00:27.756 --> 00:29.125
for me to knock over.

00:29.125 --> 00:31.262
Oh, I wonder
what the Trashsquatch

00:31.262 --> 00:33.768
is gonna bring me this year.

00:33.768 --> 00:35.070
Trashsquatch can't come

00:35.070 --> 00:36.941
unless you go to sleep
like a good boy.

00:36.941 --> 00:38.511
Can't sleep.
Too excited.

00:38.511 --> 00:41.115
When I have insomnia,
I practice mindfulness.

00:41.115 --> 00:42.318
Research has proven that--

00:43.988 --> 00:45.558
Trashsquatch.

00:45.558 --> 00:46.627
Huh.

00:46.727 --> 00:50.300
<i>The trash bins were stuffed
in a haphazard way</i>

00:50.300 --> 00:53.674
<i>for the animals'
annual refuse buffet.</i>

00:53.674 --> 00:57.949
<i>They dreamt Trashmas dreams
regardless of species,</i>

00:57.949 --> 00:59.285
<i>of bubble wrap,</i>

00:59.285 --> 01:01.155
boxes...

01:01.155 --> 01:03.059
<i>Old gravy,</i>

01:03.059 --> 01:04.763
<i>and feces.</i>

01:07.434 --> 01:11.644
<i>As the rays of sunshine
began to appear...</i>

01:13.246 --> 01:14.650
Honey, wake up!

01:14.650 --> 01:16.687
Trashmas is here!

01:16.687 --> 01:18.089
Ugh.

01:19.458 --> 01:21.162
Merry Trashmas!

01:21.162 --> 01:23.668
Me-rry Trash-mas.

01:26.573 --> 01:27.474
Aah!

01:27.474 --> 01:29.780
Where's all the garbage?
- They're empty.

01:29.780 --> 01:31.817
I was such a good dog
this year.

01:33.453 --> 01:35.625
Jill,
something horrible has hap--

01:36.694 --> 01:39.566
First no trash?
Now no Jill?

01:39.566 --> 01:41.870
What did you do
to anger the Trashsquatch?

01:41.870 --> 01:45.745
Look, Jill would never just
up and leave us on Trashmas.

01:45.745 --> 01:46.614
I'm sure there's--

01:46.614 --> 01:48.551
Jill!

01:48.551 --> 01:52.124
I told you she'd never leave us
on Trashmas.

01:52.124 --> 01:54.128
What the suds?

01:54.128 --> 01:56.165
- What's up, dudes?
- Where's Jill?

01:56.165 --> 01:57.468
I saw her leave early
this morning,

01:57.468 --> 01:59.071
so I thought
I'd take a spa day.

01:59.071 --> 02:00.374
On Trashmas?

02:00.374 --> 02:02.444
For raccoons,
every day is Trashmas.

02:02.444 --> 02:05.150
And frankly, when you all start
knocking down garbage cans,

02:05.250 --> 02:06.720
it feels like
cultural appropriation.

02:06.720 --> 02:08.691
She's gone?
That's not like Jill at all.

02:08.691 --> 02:11.262
We had a good run with her,
but she's gone, Honey.

02:11.262 --> 02:12.666
Let her go.
We have to focus

02:12.666 --> 02:15.337
one what's important
and save Trashmas.

02:15.337 --> 02:17.241
In or out.
You're letting out the steam.

02:18.778 --> 02:22.786

eating my father and sisters,</i>

02:55.083 --> 02:56.419
but I still remember it

02:56.419 --> 02:59.225
as one of the best Trashmases
I ever had.

03:00.027 --> 03:01.295
Any feedback?

03:01.295 --> 03:04.335
Uh, well, yeah,
gender is fluid.

03:04.335 --> 03:06.339
I'm sorry.
I know I'm distracted.

03:06.339 --> 03:09.178
Jill disappeared, and so,
I'm gonna need to multitask

03:09.178 --> 03:10.347
between my group duties

03:10.347 --> 03:12.251
and staring intensely
at the front door.

03:12.251 --> 03:14.255
What does staring at the door
accomplish?

03:14.255 --> 03:16.392
It's a dog thing.
You wouldn't understand.

03:16.392 --> 03:18.463
All right, I'll ask.
What's with the head bling?

03:18.463 --> 03:19.699
Well, my dad got drunk

03:19.699 --> 03:21.670
and left before taking off
these antlers,

03:21.670 --> 03:24.141
so I was locked outside alone
all night.

03:25.678 --> 03:28.116
It's actually much sadder
than it sounds.

03:28.116 --> 03:29.385
You get used
to being alone.

03:29.385 --> 03:30.287
I like to play this fun game

03:30.287 --> 03:33.193
where I try
to remember Kevin's face.

03:33.193 --> 03:35.197
I can't do it!

03:35.197 --> 03:36.132
You're welcome
to come to my place

03:36.132 --> 03:37.367
for Trashmas dinner, Cheeks.

03:37.367 --> 03:39.539
Really?
I've never had a real Trashmas.

03:39.539 --> 03:41.342
Kevin likes to travel
over the holidays...

03:41.342 --> 03:42.444
and most days.

03:42.444 --> 03:44.315
Oh, I remember
what he looks like!

03:44.315 --> 03:45.450
Nope.
I lost it.

03:45.450 --> 03:46.653
And I sure hope
he comes home soon.

03:46.754 --> 03:48.423
My bowl's been empty
for two days.

03:48.423 --> 03:50.528
Hey, I also can't remember
what food looks like.

03:50.528 --> 03:51.897
You could come too, Tabitha.

03:51.897 --> 03:54.669
It's usually 20% less violent
during the holidays.

03:54.669 --> 03:56.540
I hope this doesn't
come off as elitist,

03:56.540 --> 03:59.412
but I'm far too good
for your sad slop-fest.

03:59.412 --> 04:01.249
A Boxing Day feast awaits me.

04:01.249 --> 04:02.786
There's always
a mountain of leftovers

04:02.786 --> 04:05.490
even the hungriest cat
could never summit.

04:05.490 --> 04:07.494
- Was that an invite?
- Totally.

04:07.494 --> 04:08.831
Has she always had that accent?

04:08.831 --> 04:11.436
Well, I've been
uncharacteristically quiet

04:11.436 --> 04:13.808
this morning, and I'm sure
you're all wondering why.

04:13.808 --> 04:14.976
- Nope.
- Not at all.

04:14.976 --> 04:15.978
I liked it, actually.

04:15.978 --> 04:17.281
Because it looks like

04:17.281 --> 04:19.753
I'll be spending
yet another Trashmas alone.

04:19.753 --> 04:22.424
"Oh, what about that
hot Shar Pei you were seeing?"

04:22.424 --> 04:24.763
Well, if you must know,
I dumped him.

04:24.763 --> 04:26.900
I mean, sure,
we had white-hot chemistry,

04:26.900 --> 04:29.606
but there was nothing going on
underneath those wrinkles.

04:29.606 --> 04:32.044
It was all, "I don't know.
What do you want to pee on?"

04:32.044 --> 04:32.979
"What do you want to sniff?"

04:32.979 --> 04:36.219
And I'm like, "Take charge.
Regrow a pair."

04:36.219 --> 04:37.655
You're welcome
to come to my place

04:37.655 --> 04:40.528
and rifle through
the Bronson's trash.

04:40.528 --> 04:43.433
I'm just
pathetic enough to say yes.

04:43.433 --> 04:45.003
Me too!
I'm pathetic.

04:45.003 --> 04:46.038
Can I come?

04:46.038 --> 04:47.642
Darla won't be there.

04:47.642 --> 04:49.513
We're going through
a rough patch.

04:49.513 --> 04:52.351
Says I don't spend enough time
with the kids.

04:52.351 --> 04:53.787
They're eggs!

04:53.787 --> 04:54.956
Jill?

04:54.956 --> 04:56.392
Ugh, it's just the mail.

04:56.392 --> 04:57.427
Mail?
both: Mail?

04:57.427 --> 04:59.633
- Finish her!
- She's mine!

04:59.633 --> 05:00.535
Dogs.

05:00.535 --> 05:02.237
They have no dignity.

05:04.576 --> 05:07.114
I just want a guy
who knows what he wants.

05:07.114 --> 05:08.751
I know what Darla wants.

05:08.751 --> 05:11.489
For me to share
in the responsibility

05:11.489 --> 05:13.627
of watching
over our egg clutch

05:13.627 --> 05:15.497
so she doesn't have
to sit in the woods

05:15.598 --> 05:18.537
protecting them
from predators all alone?

05:18.537 --> 05:19.639
As if!

05:19.639 --> 05:22.745
Did someone order
a trash kebab?

05:22.745 --> 05:25.250
Well,
look who is finally useful!

05:25.250 --> 05:27.254
Aw, thanks.

05:27.254 --> 05:29.024
Maybe the universe
is telling me

05:29.024 --> 05:30.327
that it's better to be alone

05:30.327 --> 05:33.132
than chase
some nonexistent ideal male.

05:33.132 --> 05:34.335
Like this!

05:34.335 --> 05:35.905
See,
this is what I'm talking about.

05:36.005 --> 05:39.278
Madison Avenue creates
these unattainable--

05:42.519 --> 05:45.223
Oh, my God.
You're the dog from the box.

05:45.223 --> 05:47.394
<i>I'm Robo.
Pet me.</i>

05:47.394 --> 05:49.365
Ooh, so direct.

05:49.365 --> 05:51.803
You know what you want
and just ask for it.

05:51.904 --> 05:52.705
I'm Elsa.

05:52.705 --> 05:55.277
<i>What can Robo do
for you today?</i>

05:55.277 --> 05:57.481
Baby, you're doing it.

05:57.481 --> 06:00.186
Dear Lord, what is that smell?

06:00.186 --> 06:02.057
Rancid crab dip.

06:02.057 --> 06:03.493
It's Darla's favorite.

06:03.493 --> 06:06.465
I think we ate it
on our first Trashmas together.

06:06.465 --> 06:08.771
And now I've left
the best stone-cold freak

06:08.771 --> 06:11.442
I've ever known alone
in the woods?

06:11.442 --> 06:14.616
God, what have I done?

06:15.551 --> 06:18.356
Come home. Come home.
Oh, God.

06:18.356 --> 06:19.458
Jill's never gone this long.

06:19.458 --> 06:20.327
Come home.
Come home.

06:20.327 --> 06:22.197
How long
have we been standing watch?

06:22.197 --> 06:23.534
A while.

06:23.534 --> 06:25.671
Take off
that stupid Santa beard!

06:25.671 --> 06:27.709
Something terrible
has happened to Jill.

06:27.709 --> 06:30.313
Do you hear
how crazy you sound?

06:30.313 --> 06:32.384
Nothing bad can happen
on Trashmas

06:32.384 --> 06:34.421
because it's the one day
that the Trashsquatch

06:34.421 --> 06:36.425
and his jolly
invisible garbage goblins

06:36.425 --> 06:37.695
protect us all.

06:37.695 --> 06:39.298
Ugh,
I can't with this right now.

06:39.298 --> 06:40.668
No!

06:41.870 --> 06:45.010
Okay, when Jill left,
describe exactly what you saw.

06:45.010 --> 06:47.715
Well, she was laughing
and had one of those boxes

06:47.715 --> 06:50.721
with the wheels and the handle
humans use when they go away.

06:50.721 --> 06:52.692
Okay, she was laughing.
That's good.

06:52.692 --> 06:54.128
Oh, you thought
she was laughing?

06:54.128 --> 06:55.363
I thought she was crying.

06:55.363 --> 06:56.399
I didn't see her!

06:56.399 --> 06:57.635
Oh, yeah.
Me neither.

06:57.635 --> 06:59.739
But she sure got out of here
in a hurry.

06:59.739 --> 07:02.110
And then,
this big guy dressed in black

07:02.210 --> 07:02.912
grabbed her wheely box.

07:03.046 --> 07:04.516
And she said,
"No, no, I got it."

07:04.516 --> 07:05.952
But then,
he took it anyway

07:05.952 --> 07:08.590
and threw them both
in this big, black car.

07:08.590 --> 07:10.493
Jill is never coming back.

07:10.493 --> 07:13.166
And now,
we're home alone!

07:13.166 --> 07:14.936
Aah!

07:14.936 --> 07:17.809
Okay. Okay, I was
where you are at first,

07:17.809 --> 07:20.347
but then I opened my heart
to the spirit of Trash--

07:20.347 --> 07:22.652
Enough!
Trashmas is for puppies!

07:22.652 --> 07:25.256
You're six,
and you need to grow up!

07:25.256 --> 07:27.260
Maybe you need to grow down.

07:27.260 --> 07:28.564
No wonder the Trashsquatch

07:28.564 --> 07:30.534
didn't bring you any garbage
this year.

07:30.534 --> 07:33.741
There is no Trashsquatch!

07:33.741 --> 07:36.713
Who hurt you?

07:40.086 --> 07:42.992
I'm trying something.
What do you think?

07:47.200 --> 07:49.706
<i>Welcome back to
the certain percentage of you</i>

07:49.706 --> 07:53.881
<i>who decided to not spring
for ad-free Hulu</i>

07:53.881 --> 07:58.022
<i>as our cats walked across town
to eat Tabitha's meal</i>

07:58.022 --> 08:01.763
<i>and Elsa came on
to a dog made of steel.</i>

08:01.763 --> 08:05.871
<i>And with Jill's absence harder
for her to explain,</i>

08:05.871 --> 08:09.646
<i>Honey's worry was starting
to drive her insane.</i>

08:09.646 --> 08:11.850
Okay, got to think.
Did Jill have any enemies?

08:11.850 --> 08:13.754
Wait, what am I saying?
Who could hate Jill?

08:13.754 --> 08:15.691
She's pure love
wrapped in rainbows

08:15.691 --> 08:17.595
and a mumu
from Ross Dress for Less.

08:17.595 --> 08:19.031
Jill?

08:21.335 --> 08:23.741
This is bad.

08:23.741 --> 08:25.611
Chief!

08:25.611 --> 08:26.880
Go away, intruder!

08:26.980 --> 08:29.652
I have all my teeth
and none of my shots!

08:31.322 --> 08:32.992
Chief, get over here!

08:32.992 --> 08:34.428
Chief!

08:34.428 --> 08:35.931
Okay, I'll tell you,

08:35.931 --> 08:38.136
but you have to promise
not to judge me.

08:38.136 --> 08:40.473
I've always wanted to learn
how to sniff for drugs.

08:40.473 --> 08:42.244
I mean,
is that crazy?

08:43.847 --> 08:45.483
Thank you for not laughing.

08:45.483 --> 08:46.953
God, I really feel like

08:46.953 --> 08:49.559
I can let my guard down
around you.

08:49.559 --> 08:51.128
<i>Scratch my head.</i>

08:51.128 --> 08:52.565
Mm, yes, sir.

08:52.565 --> 08:54.101
God, you know,
it's funny.

08:54.101 --> 08:56.973
This morning, before we met,
I had given up on dating.

08:56.973 --> 08:59.679
Just resigned to spend
another holiday all alone.

08:59.679 --> 09:01.550
But are you free--

09:01.550 --> 09:03.620
- We have to go!
- Dang it, Shel.

09:03.620 --> 09:04.923
It was about to get humpy.

09:04.923 --> 09:06.927
The tortoise I love
is alone in the woods

09:07.027 --> 09:09.866
with my nearly born
because I abandoned her.

09:09.866 --> 09:11.503
So go get her.
I'm kind of working

09:11.503 --> 09:13.239
on not being alone myself.

09:13.239 --> 09:14.609
Get it, girl.

09:14.609 --> 09:16.880
The thing is,
I haven't visited the clutch

09:16.880 --> 09:18.550
as much as I should have--

09:18.550 --> 09:19.819
or even once--

09:19.819 --> 09:21.923
so I don't know where she is.

09:21.923 --> 09:24.495
I require your dog noses
to track her.

09:24.495 --> 09:25.898
- We'll do it!
- We have to go now

09:25.898 --> 09:27.802
before the nocturnals wake.

09:27.802 --> 09:29.706
Tortoise eggs are delicious.

09:29.706 --> 09:31.610
Don't ask me how I know.

09:31.610 --> 09:33.446
Ah!
She's three clicks this way.

09:33.446 --> 09:34.883
Let's roll.
We're losing light.

09:34.883 --> 09:37.254
Hey, so, uh,
my friends are taking off.

09:37.254 --> 09:40.561
If you want, you and I
could chase sticks and chill.

09:40.561 --> 09:42.565
- You're my friend.
- Oh.

09:42.565 --> 09:44.669
I see.
Just friends.

09:44.669 --> 09:46.405
- Friends.
- No, I got it!

09:47.675 --> 09:50.480
Thank you for being honest
and not leading me on...

09:50.480 --> 09:52.350
more than you already have.

09:52.350 --> 09:54.254
You're not better than me!

09:59.097 --> 10:00.668
Chief, please help!

10:00.668 --> 10:03.540
Oh, now you want
to play with garbage.

10:03.540 --> 10:04.943
I know you're mad at me,

10:04.943 --> 10:07.447
and you're not my favorite dog
right now either,

10:07.447 --> 10:09.384
but there is an intruder
trying to--

10:09.384 --> 10:10.955
Aah!

10:10.955 --> 10:14.194
Oh, you get your stinkin' hands
off my Honey,

10:14.194 --> 10:15.898
you damn dirty arm!

10:18.770 --> 10:22.945
Honey, we cannot go outside.
It's crawling with arms.

10:23.814 --> 10:24.916
Did you bring anything,

10:24.916 --> 10:26.953
you know, like flowers
or a dead lizard?

10:26.953 --> 10:28.657
I mean,
everything was closed today.

10:28.657 --> 10:29.859
Ow!
- Oh, sorry.

10:29.859 --> 10:31.596
I thought it was a churro.
- Well, it's not.

10:31.596 --> 10:33.065
It's actually--ow!

10:33.065 --> 10:34.636
What the hell
is wrong with you?

10:34.636 --> 10:36.005
I have no excuse this time.

10:36.005 --> 10:38.710
I'm just so hun--

10:38.710 --> 10:41.583
Why are you in my garage
making gross sounds?

10:41.583 --> 10:44.556
You didn't specify
what time to pop by

10:44.556 --> 10:45.558
when you invited us.

10:45.558 --> 10:46.927
I didn't invite you.

10:46.927 --> 10:49.264
Oh, see,
we thought you did.

10:49.264 --> 10:51.903
But we'll get out of your fur.
No harm, no foul.

10:51.903 --> 10:53.807
No, there's definitely harm.

10:53.807 --> 10:56.111
Why would you brag
about a mountain of food

10:56.111 --> 10:59.853
to two neglected cats
if you weren't inviting us?

10:59.853 --> 11:01.756
I thought it might
be aspirational for you.

11:01.756 --> 11:03.961
Hey.
Hey, these things happen.

11:03.961 --> 11:05.063
It's fine.

11:05.063 --> 11:08.369
It's not fine!

11:11.075 --> 11:14.582
This was going to be
my first real Trashmas,

11:14.582 --> 11:16.586
and you ruined it!

11:16.586 --> 11:17.655
What is happening?

11:17.655 --> 11:19.024
Have you seen him
do this before?

11:19.024 --> 11:21.796
Never, and I don't know much
about his backstory,

11:21.897 --> 11:24.034
you know, apart from him
being rescued as a kitten

11:24.034 --> 11:26.606
<i>from an abandoned military
gamma ray facility.</i>

11:26.606 --> 11:30.046
Tabitha, you are selfish!

11:30.046 --> 11:33.720
Okay, why don't we all
just take a deep--

11:33.720 --> 11:36.258
And you are an enabler!

11:36.258 --> 11:39.064
If that's what you think,
I support you.

11:39.064 --> 11:43.640
Trashmas is about garbage,
food, and friendship.

11:43.640 --> 11:46.546
This place is clean,
no food,

11:46.546 --> 11:48.717
and you're no friend!

11:48.717 --> 11:51.723
Oh, Chico,
you're scare-rousing me.

11:51.723 --> 11:55.496
Chico smash!

11:55.496 --> 11:57.367
Food!

11:59.739 --> 12:01.977
It's not not sexy.

12:06.653 --> 12:08.724
We're close.
Stay frosty.

12:08.824 --> 12:10.728
I hope Darla forgives me,
but--

12:10.728 --> 12:12.364
You're right.
Robo's trash.

12:12.364 --> 12:15.370
Just once, I'd like to find
someone who will chase me.

12:15.370 --> 12:17.775
<i>Play with me.</i>

12:24.354 --> 12:26.993
Robo!
My Robo!

12:31.937 --> 12:33.674
I knew you'd come back to me.

12:33.674 --> 12:35.376
<i>You're my master.</i>

12:35.376 --> 12:39.519
If you're trying to turn me
on, mission accomplished.

12:39.519 --> 12:41.589
How are you so perfect?

12:41.589 --> 12:43.059
<i>I love you.</i>

12:43.059 --> 12:46.265
Uh, that's a little fast.

12:46.265 --> 12:49.137
<i>What can Robo do
for you today?</i>

12:49.137 --> 12:53.112
Uh, you can start
by taking it down a notch.

12:53.981 --> 12:56.251
Okay, a little space.

12:58.422 --> 12:59.424
Do you see him?

12:59.424 --> 13:01.061
Not an arm in sight.

13:01.061 --> 13:02.898
- We did it!
- We did it! Yeah!

13:05.303 --> 13:07.608
Where are those footsteps
coming from?

13:07.608 --> 13:09.946
Here, doggy, doggy, doggies.

13:09.946 --> 13:13.954
They're coming
from inside the house!

13:17.995 --> 13:21.302
<i>I pray you're not sick
of this recap device,</i>

13:21.302 --> 13:25.476
<i>but distracted viewing
is a most common vice.</i>

13:25.476 --> 13:27.682
<i>Once charmed from Robo,</i>

13:27.682 --> 13:30.386
<i>Elsa now found him cheesy.</i>

13:30.386 --> 13:34.461
<i>Shel worried his kids
might be eggs over easy.</i>

13:34.562 --> 13:39.004
<i>The unwelcomed stranger
kept sneakin' and skulkin',</i>

13:39.004 --> 13:42.745
<i>so Honey and Chief
went totally Culkin.</i>

13:42.745 --> 13:44.549
- Pull it tighter!
- Shh!

13:47.020 --> 13:47.922
- And...
- Go!

13:49.892 --> 13:51.529
- Whoo-hoo!
- Ha ha ha!

13:51.529 --> 13:53.967
Ha?
both: Aah!

13:53.967 --> 13:55.637
There's an intruder
in the house!

13:55.637 --> 13:57.240
And we need your hands!

13:57.340 --> 13:58.710
It's go-time, boys.

13:58.710 --> 14:01.448
You look amazing.

14:04.154 --> 14:06.726
- Scratch my head.
- Maybe later.

14:06.726 --> 14:08.295
<i>Rub my belly.</i>

14:08.295 --> 14:11.402
Has it ever occurred to you
that I might have needs too?

14:11.402 --> 14:12.170
Of course not!

14:12.170 --> 14:14.809
- I love you.
- Just stop it.

14:14.809 --> 14:16.445
You don't love me.

14:16.445 --> 14:19.117
You love the idea of me.

14:20.086 --> 14:22.892
I hate myself
when I'm with you.

14:23.660 --> 14:25.196
Uh, look, Cheeks,

14:25.196 --> 14:28.369
based on the way
you flipped over a minivan,

14:28.369 --> 14:30.173
I know you're hungry,
but I can't promise

14:30.173 --> 14:32.444
there's gonna be
a lot of food left.

14:36.151 --> 14:38.790
<i>all: ♪ Hallelujah ♪</i>

14:38.790 --> 14:40.894
<i>♪ Hallelujah ♪</i>

14:40.894 --> 14:43.600
<i>♪ Hallelujah,
Hallelujah ♪</i>

14:43.600 --> 14:46.773
- It's a Trashmas miracle!
- It's a Trashmas miracle!

14:46.773 --> 14:48.375
Actually,
it's not a miracle.

14:48.375 --> 14:51.014
The neighbors just gave
our lady all their leftovers

14:51.014 --> 14:52.183
to assuage their guilt

14:52.183 --> 14:54.154
when they finally
condemn this place.

14:54.154 --> 14:56.425
Not now,
The Actually One.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.972
I casually sauntered here

15:02.972 --> 15:04.074
as fast as I could.

15:04.074 --> 15:06.145
I've reflected on my actions,

15:06.145 --> 15:07.982
and I have found them wanting.

15:07.982 --> 15:10.621
- A-plus apology.
- I didn't hear an apology.

15:10.621 --> 15:12.892
I am... sorry.

15:12.892 --> 15:15.864
That's the Trashmas miracle!

15:15.864 --> 15:17.100
- Actually--
- Ugh!

15:17.200 --> 15:19.505
I swear to God,
The Actually One!

15:19.505 --> 15:21.843
Guys, now that my blood/ham
ratio is stabilized,

15:21.843 --> 15:23.245
I want to say I'm sorry.

15:23.245 --> 15:25.483
That thing I became wasn't me.

15:25.483 --> 15:29.759
Well, whoever he was,
does he still want to smash?

15:37.440 --> 15:38.175
Do you give up,

15:38.175 --> 15:40.647
or are you thirsty for more?

15:43.018 --> 15:45.691
A little tinkle,
tinkle, tinkle.

15:48.028 --> 15:50.133
It burns!

15:50.133 --> 15:52.403
Yeah, you should
probably get that checked.

16:07.968 --> 16:10.239
Too much?

16:10.239 --> 16:12.377
And even though
I have to end this,

16:12.377 --> 16:14.181
I want you to know
I don't regret

16:14.181 --> 16:16.285
a single second
of the time we shared,

16:16.285 --> 16:19.157
and I'll always hold
a piece of you in my heart.

16:19.157 --> 16:21.361
We just want different--
<i>- Pet me.</i>

16:21.361 --> 16:23.165
And this is
what I'm talking about.

16:23.165 --> 16:26.873
I love...

16:26.873 --> 16:29.177
<i>you.</i>

16:29.979 --> 16:31.448
Robo?

16:31.448 --> 16:32.183
Robo!

16:32.183 --> 16:34.087
I literally broke his heart!

16:34.087 --> 16:36.258
Don't you die on me!

16:38.830 --> 16:39.799
Breathe, damn it!

16:39.799 --> 16:41.034
Don't leave me like this!

16:41.034 --> 16:42.505
It's too soon!

16:42.505 --> 16:45.009
You know her better
than I do.

16:45.009 --> 16:46.311
How long do you think--

16:46.311 --> 16:47.948
Yeah, she's gonna milk this
for a while.

16:48.048 --> 16:48.917
We should skedaddle.

16:48.917 --> 16:52.090
Take me instead!

16:52.591 --> 16:55.597
We'll only get one shot,
so we have to be perfect.

16:55.597 --> 16:58.269
Can I just say that
you're really good at this?

16:58.269 --> 17:01.910
Aw, thanks.
You got some killer in you too.

17:01.910 --> 17:03.880
Because
we have time for this!

17:03.880 --> 17:05.216
Okay, on my signal,

17:05.216 --> 17:07.253
Honey will go to the kitchen
and start barking.

17:07.253 --> 17:09.257
He'll avoid her, move
to the front of the house

17:09.257 --> 17:11.461
and into the living room,
where it'll be dark

17:11.461 --> 17:13.533
because Raccoon
will break all the lamps.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.504
This fill force him
to walk through a minefield

17:15.504 --> 17:17.975
of
my strategically placed poops.

17:17.975 --> 17:20.647
The three of us
will then meet here.

17:22.985 --> 17:25.289
This works too.

17:31.603 --> 17:33.773
That's it!
Run away!

17:37.548 --> 17:40.419
Oh, I've never felt so alive!
What's next?

17:40.419 --> 17:42.625
Oh, I know.
Let's rob a bank!

17:42.625 --> 17:44.294
Yeah--no.

17:44.294 --> 17:46.866
Godspeed,
beautiful traveler.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.904
I'll never forget you, Bobo.

17:48.904 --> 17:52.410
Robo.
Sorry, I've had a day.

17:52.410 --> 17:55.216
Hey, I didn't mean
to trash your love of Trashmas.

17:55.216 --> 17:56.485
Don't know when it happened,

17:56.485 --> 17:58.823
but I think
I lost my inner puppy.

17:58.823 --> 18:00.326
No, you were right.

18:00.326 --> 18:02.731
Trashmas is just a story
for the young ones.

18:02.731 --> 18:05.236
I do need to grow--

18:05.236 --> 18:07.608
It's a Trashmas miracle.

18:08.877 --> 18:11.248
Thank you, Trashsquatch!

18:11.248 --> 18:14.487
You do realize
that we were the ones who--

18:14.487 --> 18:17.995
who just missed
seeing the Trashsquatch!

18:17.995 --> 18:19.632
Hey, want to make
garbage angels?

18:19.632 --> 18:22.437
Do I?

18:33.158 --> 18:36.031
If even gross animals
can find love,

18:36.031 --> 18:38.035
maybe there is hope
for me someday.

18:38.035 --> 18:40.641
Elsa!

18:40.641 --> 18:42.410
You found us.
- Yeah.

18:42.410 --> 18:44.014
Thanks for peeing so much.

18:44.014 --> 18:45.784
Elsa, just in time.

18:45.784 --> 18:47.053
It's happening!

18:47.053 --> 18:49.324
It's a Trashmas miracle.

18:49.424 --> 18:50.359
Mm.

18:50.359 --> 18:51.796
Aw.

18:59.311 --> 19:00.847
They're beautiful...

19:00.947 --> 19:03.385
and delicious,
but mostly beautiful.

19:03.385 --> 19:06.258
Oh, that tickles.

19:06.258 --> 19:08.062
Oh!

19:08.062 --> 19:11.536
Oh, I forgot those were fake.

19:12.938 --> 19:14.240
Oh, hey, little guy.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.111
Oh, you want
your head scratched?

19:16.111 --> 19:18.616
Robo?

19:18.616 --> 19:22.056
It's you!
Your spirit came back to me!

19:22.056 --> 19:24.394
Aw, Robo.

19:24.394 --> 19:27.701
Why is that dog
hitting on my daughter?

19:33.646 --> 19:35.851
- You're an artist.
- Thanks.

19:35.851 --> 19:36.753
What's wrong?

19:36.853 --> 19:39.257
I'm still kind of worried
about Jill.

19:39.257 --> 19:41.128
Honey,
I promise you two things:

19:41.128 --> 19:42.664
one,
Jill is gonna be home soon,

19:42.765 --> 19:46.572
and two, she's gonna
be overjoyed to see us.

19:46.672 --> 19:48.810
- What did you do?
- You were half-right.

19:48.810 --> 19:51.582
And you've been permanently
banned from the Wagger app!

19:51.582 --> 19:55.122
I mean, look at this place.
Why would you do this?

19:57.060 --> 19:59.197
Oh, no.
I did this.

19:59.197 --> 20:03.072
- No, we did--
- Shh, let's play this out.

20:03.072 --> 20:05.242
You never cause
this much damage

20:05.342 --> 20:07.815
unless you're horribly upset.

20:07.815 --> 20:09.117
And why wouldn't you be?

20:09.117 --> 20:11.254
I left without saying goodbye

20:11.254 --> 20:13.258
only to be catfished
by a 14-year-old

20:13.258 --> 20:14.494
in Hacienda Heights.

20:14.494 --> 20:17.200
I'm so sorry.

20:17.200 --> 20:18.903
Come here.
Come here.

20:18.903 --> 20:24.414
I promise I'll never abandon
you at Christmastime again.

20:24.414 --> 20:26.819
- What's Christmastime?
- I don't know.

20:26.919 --> 20:28.523
<i>There was trash everywhere--</i>

20:28.523 --> 20:31.061
<i>women's razors and men's,</i>

20:31.061 --> 20:32.965
<i>bottle and briskets,</i>

20:32.965 --> 20:34.935
<i>an old man's Depends.</i>

20:34.935 --> 20:38.142
<i>But our animals learned
one true thing in the end:</i>

20:38.142 --> 20:40.881
<i>the best kind of garbage
to find</i>

20:40.881 --> 20:42.618
<i>is good friends.</i>

20:42.618 --> 20:46.324
That's all I've got.
You've heard my whole spiel.

20:46.324 --> 20:48.328
A merry Trashmas to all.

20:48.328 --> 20:50.332
And hells yeah I'm real.

20:50.332 --> 20:53.038
<i>♪ I'm dreamin' ♪</i>

20:53.038 --> 20:56.712
<i>♪ Of a white Christmas ♪</i>

21:00.186 --> 21:02.123
Mm, yeah.

21:25.236 --> 21:26.271
Oh.

21:29.410 --> 21:32.518
Eh--aah!
- Aah!

21:37.093 --> 21:38.061
That's nice,
Jen and Gabby.
