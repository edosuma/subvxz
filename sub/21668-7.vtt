on  Hell's Kitchen...

00:02.831 --> 00:04.165
Chef Ramsay announced
a special event.

00:05.121 --> 00:06.652
We are going to be hosting

00:06.653 --> 00:07.753
a high-school reunion.

00:07.754 --> 00:09.186
(All) Yes, chef.

00:09.187 --> 00:10.520
(Announcer) In the tasting menu
challenge,

00:10.521 --> 00:13.086
the Red Team failed to impress
the reunion committee.

00:13.087 --> 00:16.186
The guacamole was just a
little bit too overpowering.

00:16.187 --> 00:17.819
I'm not a big scallop person.

00:17.820 --> 00:19.319
Too barbecue-y.

00:19.320 --> 00:20.453
(Announcer) And the Blue Team...

00:20.454 --> 00:21.919
I had the perfect bite.

00:21.920 --> 00:23.319
Oh, my gosh.

00:23.320 --> 00:24.619
I need another bite.

00:26.687 --> 00:28.085
Blue Team, congratulations.

00:28.086 --> 00:29.785
- A shutout. Well done.
- Thank you, chef.

00:29.786 --> 00:31.387
(Announcer) At the
high-school-reunion dinner...

00:31.388 --> 00:32.986
Class of '91.

00:32.987 --> 00:34.151
(Announcer) In the red kitchen...

00:34.152 --> 00:35.620
Who's gonna lead the Red Team?

00:37.687 --> 00:39.352
- I am, chef.
- Let's go, then.

00:39.353 --> 00:40.852
Let's go, ladies!

00:40.853 --> 00:42.420
(Announcer) Elise had her best service yet.

00:42.421 --> 00:44.986
I do have a big mouth, but
I know how to use it.

00:44.987 --> 00:46.420
(Gordon) They're nicely
cooked, though... beautiful.

00:46.421 --> 00:47.886
- Good job, ladies.
- Whoo.

00:47.887 --> 00:50.151
(Announcer) Elizabeth
mastered the fish station...

00:50.152 --> 00:52.318
Beautifully cooked, this snapper.
Thank you, chef.

00:52.319 --> 00:53.685
(Announcer) But in the blue kitchen...

00:53.686 --> 00:56.087
I want a special comeback
service from you guys, yes?

00:56.088 --> 00:57.686
(All) Yes, chef!

00:57.687 --> 00:58.853
(Announcer) Paul disappointed on fish...

00:58.854 --> 01:01.352
The fish is [Bleep] raw!

01:01.353 --> 01:03.219
I don't expect that from you!

01:03.220 --> 01:05.587
(Announcer) And Monterray and
Jonathon just made matters worse.

01:05.588 --> 01:07.752
It's raw. I am so pissed off.

01:07.753 --> 01:09.852
Get out!

01:09.853 --> 01:11.585
(Announcer) The Red Team
fed all their diners,

01:11.586 --> 01:13.720
and finished the Blue Team's
dinner service as well.

01:13.721 --> 01:15.119
Beautiful.
Let's go.

01:15.120 --> 01:16.787
(Announcer) - The Blue Team nominated...
- Monterray.

01:16.788 --> 01:18.652
(Announcer) - And...
- Paul.

01:18.653 --> 01:20.886
(Announcer) But chef
Ramsay wasn't satisfied.

01:20.887 --> 01:22.653
I want to hear from one other person.

01:22.654 --> 01:23.986
Jonathon.

01:23.987 --> 01:25.585
(Announcer) Ultimately,
chef Ramsay chose...

01:25.586 --> 01:26.987
Monterray. Give me your chef's jacket.

01:26.988 --> 01:28.987
Your time is done in  Hell's Kitchen.

01:28.988 --> 01:31.586

dream of becoming head chef

02:53.287 --> 02:54.752
I was a nervous wreck.

Chef Ramsay saw
some weak points in me

02:57.520 --> 02:59.353
that he needed to bring to my attention,

up and buckle up, man.

We got ladies to impress,
you know what I'm saying?

07:53.554 --> 07:55.619
20 minutes to go, yes?

07:55.620 --> 07:56.920
(All) Yes, chef.

07:59.453 --> 08:02.219
(Announcer) While Tommy seems
focused on the task at hand,

08:02.220 --> 08:04.419
Krupa is anything but.

08:04.420 --> 08:06.252
Krupa,

08:06.253 --> 08:07.387
what are you doing?

08:07.388 --> 08:09.786
I've got a rabbit braising in...

08:09.787 --> 08:11.452
Um, um, raspberry...

08:11.453 --> 08:13.952
Uh, the Belgian white.

08:13.953 --> 08:16.219
If we're gonna win any challenge,

08:16.220 --> 08:17.953
each individual person has
to be running at 100%.

08:17.954 --> 08:20.386
And Krupa's running at about 50% right now.

08:20.387 --> 08:21.719
(Krupa) Uh, wait.

08:21.720 --> 08:22.787
Who are you saying "wait" to?

08:22.788 --> 08:24.853
Oh, uh, Elise...
I mean Gina.

08:26.420 --> 08:28.019
Carrie. Wow.

08:28.020 --> 08:30.252
- Five minutes, let's go.
(All) - Yes, chef.

08:30.253 --> 08:31.719
Pineapple...

08:31.720 --> 08:33.086
I want to win, ladies.

08:33.087 --> 08:34.519
(Gordon) Come on!

08:34.520 --> 08:36.686
30 seconds to go.

08:36.687 --> 08:38.586
Oh, my God!

08:38.587 --> 08:41.552
(Gordon) 3, 2, 1...

08:41.553 --> 08:42.986
And serve.

08:42.986 --> 08:44.217
Right, Red Team, Blue Team.

08:44.219 --> 08:45.951
I want all of you
to rank your dishes

08:45.952 --> 08:47.020
from one to five.

08:47.021 --> 08:49.119
Red Team,
you have one extra

08:49.120 --> 08:51.152
in your team,
so you're going to drop one.

08:51.153 --> 08:52.652
- Start now.
- Let's go, guys.

08:52.653 --> 08:53.851
That doesn't have any flavor to me.

08:53.852 --> 08:54.987
Is this chicken?

08:54.988 --> 08:57.152
Chicken?
That's a funny-looking chicken.

08:57.153 --> 08:59.052
It's rabbit.

08:59.053 --> 09:00.719
Rabbit, chicken,
whatever it is,

09:00.720 --> 09:02.020
Krupa's [Bleep] was nasty.

09:04.620 --> 09:06.319
I'm beyond pissed off.

09:06.320 --> 09:07.986
My dish was not the worst.

09:07.987 --> 09:10.486
Ooh, this sauce is weird.
Whose is this?

09:10.487 --> 09:12.319
- It's mine.
- That's five.

09:12.320 --> 09:13.652
- That's five?
- Really?

09:13.653 --> 09:15.286
(Natalie) That broth's weird.

09:15.287 --> 09:16.986
It has something weird in it.

09:16.987 --> 09:18.751
- What's in the sauce?
- The beer, chili...

09:18.752 --> 09:19.818
That's what it is, the beer.
So five?

09:19.819 --> 09:21.285
Right?
That's what we're doing?

09:21.286 --> 09:22.518
You want to send the broth up last.

09:22.519 --> 09:23.687
(Will) Broth is five.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.419
I was a little bit surprised

09:25.420 --> 09:27.019
that Paulie was ranked last,

09:27.020 --> 09:28.953
'cause Paulie's a pretty good chef.

09:28.954 --> 09:30.719
But his dish was bad, man.

09:30.720 --> 09:33.619
Red Team,
whose dish are you dropping?

09:33.620 --> 09:34.686
Elise.

09:34.687 --> 09:36.319
Krupa's dish,

09:36.320 --> 09:38.319
because it's a little
tough and under-seasoned.

09:38.320 --> 09:40.153
Carrie, why do you look
so pissed off?

09:40.154 --> 09:42.952
I didn't think mine deserved fifth.

09:42.953 --> 09:44.753
Hey, listen, the good news is,
at least you made the cut.

09:44.754 --> 09:47.052
Hey, that's right, chef.

09:47.053 --> 09:48.053
Paul and Carrie.
Let's go.

09:48.054 --> 09:49.552
Let's go, Carrie.

09:49.553 --> 09:51.219
(Jonathon) Come on, Paul.

09:51.220 --> 09:52.819
(Will) Come on, blue.

09:52.820 --> 09:54.385
Let's start off
with the ladies first.

09:54.386 --> 09:55.453
Carrie, please.

09:55.454 --> 09:56.519
I did filet.

09:56.520 --> 09:58.586
I marinated it in a stout beer.

09:58.587 --> 10:01.019
And with my sauce,
I used the raspberry.

10:01.020 --> 10:02.718
Put a little of the stout in there as well.

10:02.719 --> 10:04.051
I think it's delicious.

10:04.052 --> 10:05.451
I think you ladies will
definitely enjoy it.

10:05.452 --> 10:07.087
You can really taste the
raspberry in there.

10:07.088 --> 10:09.119
Mm-hmm. You can feel the beer in that dish.

10:09.120 --> 10:11.419
I could see
how you'd be a little burned

10:11.420 --> 10:13.285
- that this is the fifth choice.
- Hey, it's all good.

10:13.286 --> 10:14.751
(Gordon) Well done.

10:14.752 --> 10:15.751
- Thank you.
-  brilliant.

10:15.752 --> 10:17.153
Paul, please.
What is that?

10:17.154 --> 10:18.686
Grilled piece of salmon

10:18.687 --> 10:19.920
with hefeweizen broth.

10:19.921 --> 10:22.019
I was a little shocked when my team felt

10:22.020 --> 10:23.786
that my dish was the weakest.

10:23.787 --> 10:24.820
Salmon's beautiful.

10:24.821 --> 10:26.519
Mmm. Time to taste the broth.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.319
(Paul) We'll see how it plays out.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.619
[Coughing] Sorry.

10:30.620 --> 10:31.719
[Laughter]

10:31.720 --> 10:33.519
She's, like,
dying over there.

10:33.520 --> 10:34.719
Ah.

10:34.720 --> 10:36.752
- That's bitter.
- Yes.

10:36.753 --> 10:38.553
Ladies, I'm sure we're all in agreeance.

10:38.554 --> 10:40.519
The point has to go to Carrie.

10:40.520 --> 10:41.519
Yes!

10:41.520 --> 10:43.287
- Thank you, ladies.
- Thank you, chef.

10:43.288 --> 10:45.719
I'm not just a pantry girl!

10:45.720 --> 10:47.687
Carrie, that was, for me,
the best dish

10:47.688 --> 10:50.119
you've ever cooked.

10:50.120 --> 10:52.419
Okay, your fourth place...
Jonathon and Elise.

10:52.420 --> 10:53.652
Let's go.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.786
Elise.

10:55.787 --> 10:58.186
What I made for you today is salmon.

10:58.187 --> 11:00.886
Cooked it in the Belgian white beer.

11:00.887 --> 11:02.351
(Christina) It's interesting.

11:02.352 --> 11:04.187
Unlike the last two dishes,
it's a little more lighter,

11:04.188 --> 11:05.452
which is nice.

11:05.453 --> 11:07.018
I tried to go lighter,
because I know personally,

11:07.019 --> 11:08.251
when I drink beer, I'm full.

11:08.252 --> 11:10.220
Well, look at the size of you.
It's no wonder.

11:10.221 --> 11:11.919
Not even pint-sized.

11:11.920 --> 11:13.652
Jonathon, please.

11:13.653 --> 11:15.552
Whoo. Ooh, wow. Stand back.

11:15.553 --> 11:17.485
When Jonathon pulled his lid off his dish,

11:17.486 --> 11:18.587
I was like... [gasps]

11:18.588 --> 11:20.086
What is that?

11:20.087 --> 11:23.420
Visually, it's got that sort
of pineapple gone wild.

11:24.920 --> 11:26.919
It was fruit salad on meat again.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.052
I call this the,
uh, punch-drunk chicken.

11:29.053 --> 11:30.220
You open a can of pineapple

11:30.221 --> 11:33.052
and you stick it on top of a chicken.

11:33.053 --> 11:35.252
A lot of chefs are
fascinated with proteins.

11:35.253 --> 11:37.519
You are obsessed with fruit.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.187
Explain to the ladies
what the dish is, please.

11:39.188 --> 11:41.319
I have a pan-seared chicken breast.

11:41.320 --> 11:43.619
I incorporated my raspberry lambic

11:43.620 --> 11:45.551
into my pineapple and bed of hash.

11:45.552 --> 11:46.720
It's a pretty tasty dish.

11:46.721 --> 11:48.186
It's sweet.

11:48.187 --> 11:49.619
Too sweet?

11:49.620 --> 11:51.052
Yeah.

11:51.053 --> 11:53.552
The thing about good beer is the balance.

11:53.553 --> 11:55.752
And so I just think that
this is just missing

11:55.753 --> 11:57.319
a little bit of that balance.

11:57.320 --> 11:59.519
Ladies, um, Red Team or Blue Team?

11:59.520 --> 12:01.219
Red Team. Thank you.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.518
Congratulations, Elise. Good job.

12:02.519 --> 12:03.653
Good job, Elise.

12:03.654 --> 12:05.352
[Bleep].

12:05.353 --> 12:07.520
Man, I'm... I'm about to the
point where I'm ready to say,

12:07.521 --> 12:09.086
"[bleep] Using some fruits."

12:09.087 --> 12:10.519
But you know what?

12:10.520 --> 12:11.818
Inside, I can't let that happen.

12:11.819 --> 12:13.053
I love fruit, man.

12:13.054 --> 12:15.186
Okay, two-nil to the Red Team.

12:15.187 --> 12:16.619
Let's go, Jennifer.

12:16.620 --> 12:18.253
(Announcer) With the red
team leading two to zero,

12:18.254 --> 12:21.486
Jennifer's hefeweizen
chicken and sausage stew...

12:21.487 --> 12:23.953
I mean, visually, it looks
like a plate of leftovers.

12:23.954 --> 12:26.552
(Announcer) Is up against
Natalie's chocolate stout filet.

12:26.553 --> 12:28.953
Honestly, it's almost like
you're drinking a beer.

12:28.954 --> 12:31.586
(Announcer) Over Jennifer. Iumphs

12:31.587 --> 12:32.986
good job, girl.

12:32.987 --> 12:34.920
(Announcer) With the red
team's lead cut to one,

12:34.921 --> 12:37.819
Elizabeth's Amber mussels and clams...

12:37.820 --> 12:39.319
Salty. It is salty.

12:39.320 --> 12:40.820
(Announcer) Faces off against will's

12:40.821 --> 12:42.786
lambic-infused venison loin.

12:42.787 --> 12:45.053
I think it's delicious.
It has everything, that dish.

12:45.054 --> 12:47.119
(Announcer) Is complete. Team's comeback

12:47.120 --> 12:48.552
boo-yah, kids. Boo-yah.

12:48.553 --> 12:50.085
Good job. We'll shut 'em down.

12:50.086 --> 12:52.051
(Announcer) With the score now tied...

12:52.052 --> 12:53.151
Blue Team, Red Team,
let's go.

12:53.152 --> 12:54.351
(Announcer) It all comes down

12:54.352 --> 12:56.087
to the top-ranked dishes from each team...

12:56.088 --> 12:59.519
Jamie's for the Red Team
and Tommy's for the blue.

12:59.520 --> 13:00.786
Jamie, please.

13:00.787 --> 13:03.419
I marinated the duck in the Belgian white

13:03.420 --> 13:04.918
with some garlic and shallots,

13:04.919 --> 13:06.385
and then the duck has a glaze

13:06.386 --> 13:08.251
of the raspberry beer reduction.
Ladies?

13:08.252 --> 13:09.451
It's good.
It's interesting.

13:09.452 --> 13:10.618
(Hallie) Yeah, different.

13:10.619 --> 13:12.218
I mean, the duck is, uh, delicious.

13:12.219 --> 13:13.485
I was hoping somebody would do duck

13:13.486 --> 13:14.487
with a raspberry lambic.

13:14.488 --> 13:16.619
Yeah, it's nice.

13:16.620 --> 13:18.020
Tommy did duck
with a raspberry lambic.

13:18.021 --> 13:20.686
Did he really?
They're the same dish?

13:20.687 --> 13:21.352
Yeah.

13:21.353 --> 13:22.686
Very good.
Great job.

13:22.687 --> 13:24.586
- Thank you.
- Okay, Tommy.

13:24.587 --> 13:26.885
- Please wow the ladies.
- I did the duck as well.

13:26.886 --> 13:28.118
Let me show you
how it's done, Jamie.

13:28.119 --> 13:29.887
All right, check it out.
Here's what we did here.

13:29.888 --> 13:31.019
Oh, my gosh.

13:31.020 --> 13:32.351
I boiled my purple potatoes
down in the stout.

13:32.352 --> 13:33.453
Then I just put a side of brussels sprouts,

13:33.454 --> 13:34.786
which were, uh,

13:34.787 --> 13:36.287
cooked down in your hefeweizen.

13:36.288 --> 13:37.786
Mmm. That's good.

13:37.787 --> 13:39.486
Yeah, rock on.
It's pretty good.

13:39.487 --> 13:40.687
This has a depth.

13:40.688 --> 13:42.652
Mm-hmm.
The meat has a saltiness.

13:42.653 --> 13:44.453
And you still get the
sweetness from the lambic.

13:44.454 --> 13:46.686
Good job.
I mean, really good job.

13:46.687 --> 13:48.286
Back in line, both of you, please.

13:48.287 --> 13:49.318
Thank you, ladies.

13:49.319 --> 13:50.451
(Will) Good job, Tommy.

13:50.452 --> 13:52.220
I was just trying to flirt a little bit.

13:52.221 --> 13:54.652
The cute brunette seemed
to enjoy my company.

13:54.653 --> 13:55.953
Two good dishes... I mean,

13:55.954 --> 13:59.319
this is going to be really difficult.

13:59.320 --> 14:01.419
One dish had an edge.

14:01.420 --> 14:03.420
Congratulations goes to...

14:04.214 --> 14:06.034
[Dramatic music]

14:10.859 --> 14:13.191
[Dramatic music]

14:13.409 --> 14:15.608
(Announcer) Chef Ramsey
challenged the teams

14:15.609 --> 14:17.076
to cook creatively with beer.

14:17.077 --> 14:19.108
The score is tied,
and it all comes down

14:19.109 --> 14:20.975
to the final two dishes.

14:20.976 --> 14:23.541
Two good dishes... I mean, this is
going to be really difficult.

14:23.542 --> 14:24.942
(Announcer) Both Jamie and Tommy

14:24.943 --> 14:27.608
prepared versions of a
lambic-marinated duck.

14:27.609 --> 14:29.175
And both dishes were ranked

14:29.176 --> 14:31.375
the best on their respective teams.

14:31.376 --> 14:33.641
Congratulations goes to...

14:33.642 --> 14:35.208
- Blue Team!
- Yeah!

14:35.209 --> 14:36.441
Damn it.

14:36.442 --> 14:38.641
It was like a ton of
bricks just fell on us...

14:38.642 --> 14:40.741
Again.

14:40.742 --> 14:42.441
- All right.
- Good job, Tommy.

14:42.442 --> 14:44.808
- Good job, Tommy.
- Way to go, guys.

14:44.809 --> 14:46.508
Hell, yeah.
I aced it.

14:46.509 --> 14:47.940
This definitely proves the fact

14:47.941 --> 14:49.542
that I'm just the most awesome
of anyone in the world.

14:49.543 --> 14:51.208
Ladies, a big thank-you as always.

14:51.209 --> 14:52.208
Thank you.

14:52.209 --> 14:54.275
(Gordon) Yes? Great job.

14:54.276 --> 14:55.476
Best wishes. See you again.

14:55.477 --> 14:56.875
Blue Team,

14:56.876 --> 14:58.661
I've got an amazing day.

14:58.662 --> 15:00.075
Do you like speed?

15:00.076 --> 15:01.141
Meth or coke?

15:01.142 --> 15:02.508
Oh, my God.

15:02.509 --> 15:04.841
Only kidding.
I'm only kidding.

15:04.842 --> 15:06.074
Switch spots with me, please.

15:06.075 --> 15:07.809
You're gonna make me
stand next to him?

15:07.810 --> 15:10.908
Okay, all of you are gonna be

15:10.909 --> 15:15.141
V.I.P. guests
at the long beach Grand Prix

15:15.142 --> 15:16.541
Indy Car racing.

15:16.542 --> 15:18.808
- Yes.
- Oh, fantastic.

15:18.809 --> 15:20.908
Whoo. [Laughs]

15:20.909 --> 15:23.008
Get yourselves up to the
dorm as fast as possible

15:23.009 --> 15:24.741
and enjoy

15:24.742 --> 15:25.909
your day of speed.

15:25.910 --> 15:28.441
Whoo!

15:28.442 --> 15:29.708
Oh, dear.

15:29.709 --> 15:31.708
Ladies, it pains me to say this.

15:31.709 --> 15:33.041
Today is

15:33.042 --> 15:34.475
delivery day.

15:34.476 --> 15:36.075
[All groan]

15:36.076 --> 15:37.841
Delivery day... 
everyone knows.

15:37.842 --> 15:39.009
This is the worst punishment.

15:39.010 --> 15:40.541
[Sniffles] That's right.

15:40.542 --> 15:42.108
We've got up to

15:42.109 --> 15:43.675
20 trucks arriving...

15:43.676 --> 15:46.041
Restocking,
resupplying.

15:46.042 --> 15:48.041
It's gonna be... 
it's gonna be tough.

15:48.042 --> 15:49.775
[Sobs] It's okay.
 It's okay.

15:49.776 --> 15:50.842
Elise, you okay? Mm-hmm.

15:50.843 --> 15:52.775
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

15:52.776 --> 15:54.207
What... what do you mean "nothing"?

15:54.208 --> 15:55.809
You're standing there
crying your eyes out.

15:55.810 --> 15:57.341
Talk to me.

15:57.342 --> 15:59.475
Nothing, chef.

15:59.476 --> 16:02.341
Really? You're gonna cry
'cause we lost a challenge?

16:02.342 --> 16:03.841
Come on. 
Suck it up.

16:03.842 --> 16:05.441
It was like a little spoiled girl.

16:05.442 --> 16:07.176
She doesn't get her way,
she throws a fit.

16:07.177 --> 16:08.775
It's okay.
Bring it on, chef.

16:08.776 --> 16:10.775
I'm not crying.
I'll take it.

16:10.776 --> 16:12.209
Start off by cleaning down the kitchens.

16:12.210 --> 16:13.908
Let's go.

16:13.909 --> 16:16.075
[Sighs]

16:16.076 --> 16:18.675
[Truck beeping]

16:18.676 --> 16:21.308
[Horn honking loudly] [Bleep]!

16:21.309 --> 16:24.208
Your scream scared me
more than the horn did.

16:24.209 --> 16:25.508
Ice.

16:25.509 --> 16:26.976
Ice, ice, baby.

16:28.042 --> 16:29.276
I don't want to lift that.

16:29.277 --> 16:31.041
I'm livid. I'm not gonna sit here

16:31.042 --> 16:32.674
and pretend 
like I'm not mad as hell

16:32.675 --> 16:34.542
that we're about to be
carrying all this stuff.

16:34.543 --> 16:35.908
I got my point.

16:35.909 --> 16:37.841
I'm just tired of being punished

16:37.842 --> 16:39.309
because the rest
of the members on my team

16:39.310 --> 16:40.675
make rookie mistakes.

16:40.676 --> 16:41.975
Ow.

16:41.976 --> 16:44.708
This punishment sucks.

16:44.709 --> 16:46.841
The ice is, like, so cold.

16:46.842 --> 16:48.841
Like, my arms are getting,
like, frostbitten.

16:48.842 --> 16:50.475
Can't take this. [Groans]

16:50.476 --> 16:52.508
This one's, like, wet.

16:52.509 --> 16:55.441
It's heavy.

16:55.442 --> 16:57.641
- You okay with two?
- Be careful.

16:57.642 --> 16:59.476
Carrie, don't take on too much.

17:00.642 --> 17:01.841
Oh, my God.

17:01.842 --> 17:04.242
What a dum-dum.

17:06.509 --> 17:08.075
[Groans]

17:08.076 --> 17:10.040
(Announcer) While Elise seems
to have put it in park

17:10.040 --> 17:11.276
at the punishment,

17:11.277 --> 17:13.340
the Blue Team rolls up to the racetrack.

17:13.342 --> 17:14.407
Hot damn!

17:14.409 --> 17:15.907
We pull up, and all I see

17:15.909 --> 17:17.240
is the Hell's Kitchen indy car.

17:17.241 --> 17:18.509
And it was badass.

17:18.510 --> 17:20.108
I'm Paul, man. Ari Luyendyk, Jr.

17:20.108 --> 17:22.808
What's goin' on, man?
Will. Hey, how are you?

17:22.809 --> 17:24.675
We got to meet Simona, man.

17:24.675 --> 17:26.241
A hot chick in a fast car...

17:26.242 --> 17:28.407
Oh, that's right up my alley, man.

17:28.409 --> 17:30.408
Yes. Yeah, baby!

17:30.409 --> 17:32.175
Time to rock and roll.

17:32.176 --> 17:35.408
[Tires squealing]

17:35.409 --> 17:38.175
You know, the g's just snatch
you back in the seat...

17:38.176 --> 17:41.608
Speeds of way over 220, man.

17:41.609 --> 17:43.441
It's a unbelievable feeling, man.

17:43.442 --> 17:45.609
I'm gonna talk about this
for the rest of my life.

17:45.610 --> 17:46.776
Yee-ha!

17:48.909 --> 17:50.040
I'm pretty bad in cooking,

17:50.041 --> 17:51.876
so you guys have to teach me something.

17:51.877 --> 17:53.441
I'm pretty bad at driving a car.

17:53.442 --> 17:55.741
I don't know anything about racing.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.975
I met some really cute
girl who drives cars.

17:57.976 --> 18:00.941
So I was interested in, you know, stuff.

18:00.942 --> 18:02.107
(Will) Where are you from?

18:02.108 --> 18:03.442
- Switzerland.
- Switzerland?

18:03.443 --> 18:06.041
- Yeah.
- I'm a big fan of your cheese.

18:06.042 --> 18:07.841
- Huh?
- With the holes in it...

18:07.842 --> 18:09.109
With the holes in it, yeah.

18:09.110 --> 18:11.375
Paul, you got to work on your game.

18:11.376 --> 18:13.275
[Imitates bomb whistling]

18:13.276 --> 18:14.442
[Insects chirping]

18:14.443 --> 18:16.975
[Truck beeping]

18:16.976 --> 18:19.175
- What do we got this time?
- What?

18:19.176 --> 18:21.608
(Krupa) Are you [Bleep] serious?

18:21.609 --> 18:23.375
There's no way I could carry in

18:23.376 --> 18:25.807
kegs that weigh more than
some of us put together.

18:25.808 --> 18:26.907
All right, one step at a time.

18:26.908 --> 18:27.909
Can you lift it up?

18:27.910 --> 18:28.909
I can't do it.

18:28.910 --> 18:31.041
Put it on the step, at least.

18:31.042 --> 18:32.176
[Scoffs] Really?

18:32.177 --> 18:34.841
Oh, my God.

18:34.842 --> 18:37.275
I'm not being a baby, but
this is heavy as hell.

18:37.276 --> 18:38.541
It hurts.

18:38.542 --> 18:40.676
Can someone walk with me and
just get this one down?

18:40.677 --> 18:42.241
Elise is definitely a diva.

18:42.242 --> 18:43.240
Every one inch, I'm like,

18:43.241 --> 18:44.774
"Elise, you got to [Bleep] pick it up."

18:44.775 --> 18:46.040
She's pissing me off.

18:46.041 --> 18:47.776
(Jamie) I'm really just done with Elise.

18:47.777 --> 18:50.408
She gets in this, like,
rut of attitude.

18:50.409 --> 18:54.241
And it's a weight that
we carry all the time.

18:54.242 --> 18:55.440
(Elise) I'm here to [Bleep] win.

18:55.441 --> 18:56.709
I'm not here to throw my back out.

18:56.710 --> 18:58.141
This is ridiculous.

18:58.142 --> 18:59.608
I got to stop.

18:59.609 --> 19:01.208
Let's use the cart.

19:01.209 --> 19:02.941
Well, can y'all three not get it?

19:02.942 --> 19:05.275
We can take our turn on the cart.

19:05.276 --> 19:07.040
Does your name... does
that cart say "Carrie"?

19:07.041 --> 19:08.674
Elise, take the [Bleep] cart.
Thank you.

19:08.675 --> 19:09.940
(Carrie) I'm done with Elise.

19:09.941 --> 19:11.407
Who died and made her queen?

19:11.408 --> 19:13.040
Why don't y'all just bring' em to the door,

19:13.041 --> 19:14.142
and I'll wheel 'em to the stack?

19:14.143 --> 19:15.741
Oh, does it have your name on it?

19:15.742 --> 19:18.009
(Elise) You know what?
My fist is about to have your teeth on it.

19:18.010 --> 19:19.641
- How about that?
- Knock it off.

19:19.642 --> 19:21.141
Seriously.

19:21.142 --> 19:22.409
Elise is not a team player.

19:22.410 --> 19:25.941
I was just absolutely fed
up with her attitude.

19:25.942 --> 19:28.241
Like, that's it.
You've hit your strike limit.

19:28.242 --> 19:30.208
You're done.

19:30.209 --> 19:32.176
I'm exhausted.

19:34.176 --> 19:36.575
(Announcer) As the day comes to a close,

19:36.576 --> 19:38.774
the Blue Team is winding down
from a day at the track.

19:38.775 --> 19:40.576
Those race cars got moving today.

19:40.577 --> 19:42.875
I was like... [laughs]

19:42.876 --> 19:44.975
(Announcer) Meanwhile, the Red Team...

19:44.976 --> 19:46.775
Come on, Jennifer, what's up?

19:46.776 --> 19:49.175
(Announcer) Is all wound up.

19:49.176 --> 19:50.909
All right. Well, I'll be
the leader... I'll start.

19:50.910 --> 19:53.475
Elise, I take the punishments

19:53.476 --> 19:54.908
so serious,

19:54.909 --> 19:57.175
and I feel like sometimes you don't.

19:57.176 --> 19:58.375
I agree.

19:58.376 --> 20:00.109
There's a lot of times
where you stand around

20:00.110 --> 20:02.375
or take the easy jobs,
and that irritates me.

20:02.376 --> 20:03.675
When?

20:03.676 --> 20:06.408
You just tend to walk
slow and tend to, like...

20:06.409 --> 20:08.475
Yeah, because I'm not
gonna overextend myself.

20:08.476 --> 20:10.574
If I know I can't carry it or I
know it's too heavy for me...

20:10.575 --> 20:11.876
But it's okay for your teammates to be...

20:11.877 --> 20:13.541
To haul every heavy [Bleep]?

20:13.542 --> 20:14.876
Some of 'em can carry more!

20:14.877 --> 20:16.775
Here we go.

20:16.776 --> 20:19.108
Did I take two bags of ice
on my shoulders

20:19.109 --> 20:20.309
like I was Hercules?
No.

20:20.310 --> 20:21.807
Because I'm not trying to impress

20:21.808 --> 20:22.974
any of these people here.

20:22.975 --> 20:24.540
They're not the ones who's gonna say

20:24.541 --> 20:25.642
I can stay or can't.

20:25.643 --> 20:27.875
This is your team.
The punishment is all of us.

20:27.876 --> 20:29.676
The rest of us are busting our ass.

20:29.677 --> 20:31.341
But I...
I bust my ass, too.

20:31.342 --> 20:33.509
So [Bleep] that.

20:39.700 --> 20:42.532
[Dramatic music]

20:42.533 --> 20:44.599
(Announcer) Fed up with
Elise's diva attitude,

20:44.600 --> 20:47.199
the rest of the Red Team
has confronted her

20:47.200 --> 20:49.332
about her lack of effort
in today's punishment.

20:49.333 --> 20:50.800
The punishment is all of us.

20:50.801 --> 20:52.232
The rest of us

20:52.233 --> 20:53.500
are busting our ass,
and you're like...

20:53.501 --> 20:55.499
I bust my ass, too!
[Bleep] That.

20:55.500 --> 20:57.499
You're getting all defensive and stuff.

20:57.500 --> 20:59.600
I'm not being defensive!
I'm defending myself on the matter.

20:59.601 --> 21:01.232
That's being defensive.

21:01.233 --> 21:04.732
Okay.

21:04.733 --> 21:07.299
The Red Team got upset with
me, and I don't really care,

21:07.300 --> 21:08.900
because I'm not here to make friends.

21:08.901 --> 21:12.132
But in this game, you
have to have a strategy.

21:12.133 --> 21:14.799
I don't want there to be animosity.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.265
I will try harder
to move over this bump.

21:17.266 --> 21:18.832
All right.

21:18.833 --> 21:20.964
(Elise) I just want to have
a good service tomorrow.

21:20.965 --> 21:22.400
And I will say whatever I have to say,

21:22.401 --> 21:24.733
because I don't like losing.

21:27.200 --> 21:30.832
(Announcer) As both teams get an
early start on a long day of prep,

21:30.833 --> 21:32.965
Elise... can I help anybody with anything?

21:32.966 --> 21:34.898
(Announcer) Appears to have a new attitude.

21:34.899 --> 21:36.731
You want to help me with this?
Here's the salad for it.

21:36.732 --> 21:37.933
There's backup down here.

21:37.934 --> 21:39.832
Okay.

21:39.833 --> 21:40.831
This is interesting.

21:40.832 --> 21:42.566
I think Elise is working on her attitude,

21:42.567 --> 21:44.499
'cause at the end of the day,

21:44.500 --> 21:46.400
we need to figure out how we can win.

21:46.401 --> 21:47.899
I just want to win.

21:47.900 --> 21:49.763
Let's pray.
No, I'm just kidding.

21:49.764 --> 21:50.366
[Laughter]

21:52.400 --> 21:54.565
Who's doing what here?
I can work on the meats.

21:54.566 --> 21:56.098
I'll help you knock some out real quick.

21:56.099 --> 21:58.331
When you wrap those Wellingtons,
do you do four in a sheet?

21:58.332 --> 21:59.531
Yep. How many you have?

21:59.532 --> 22:00.833
Do several of these, man.

22:00.834 --> 22:02.165
Let's face it, man.

22:02.166 --> 22:03.931
You know, our dinner service is [Bleep].

22:03.932 --> 22:05.700
It's definitely a time for redemption

22:05.701 --> 22:07.199
for the Blue Team,

22:07.200 --> 22:08.733
so, by God, let it be tonight,
you know?

22:08.734 --> 22:09.865
Please.

22:09.866 --> 22:11.632
Paul, feel good today?

22:11.633 --> 22:13.131
My dish yesterday
wasn't up to snuff.

22:13.132 --> 22:14.864
Yeah, I'm definitely ready to bounce back.

22:14.865 --> 22:16.800
Hopefully I keep my head
above water tonight.

22:16.801 --> 22:18.832
Everybody needs to keep
their head in the game.

22:18.833 --> 22:20.733
Do what you know.
And that's it.

22:22.600 --> 22:23.732
James.

22:23.733 --> 22:25.032
Yes, chef?

22:25.033 --> 22:26.800
Open Hell's Kitchen, please.

22:28.000 --> 22:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

22:38.733 --> 22:40.732
(Announcer) It's beer
night in Hell's Kitchen.

22:40.733 --> 22:42.899
This looks like a water lamp.

22:42.900 --> 22:45.499
(Announcer) In addition to special
beer towers at every table,

22:45.500 --> 22:48.232
chef Ramsay has added
Belgian ale-steamed mussels

22:48.233 --> 22:51.065
and stout-spiced venison to the menu.

22:51.066 --> 22:52.764
Order in, chef.
Thank you. Thank you.

22:52.765 --> 22:54.100
Okay, here we go...
Three lobster spaghetti,

22:54.101 --> 22:56.065
- one scallops.
(All) - Yes, chef.

22:56.066 --> 22:57.700
Come on, drive it, Elise.
Let's go.

22:57.701 --> 22:58.199
Yes, chef.

22:58.200 --> 23:00.233
And work like a team.
Jamie, did you drop your scallops?

23:00.234 --> 23:02.099
Scallops are dropped right now.

23:02.100 --> 23:03.933
(Elise) I'm a minute and a
half away on the spaghetti.

23:03.934 --> 23:06.065
Okay. Want me to say it
again, or are we good?

23:06.066 --> 23:07.298
I have a minute and a half out.

23:07.299 --> 23:08.464
I don't want to jinx anything.

23:08.465 --> 23:10.231
Elise is trying to work
on holding her tongue.

23:10.232 --> 23:11.464
I hope that it stays that way.

23:11.465 --> 23:12.898
How long you need on your scallop?

23:12.899 --> 23:14.464
'Cause I'm ready to go.
 I can walk.

23:14.465 --> 23:15.564
Where's the spaghetti?

23:15.565 --> 23:17.264
Walking with three lobster spaghettis.

23:17.265 --> 23:19.264
We got one more scallop
following this one, ladies.

23:19.265 --> 23:20.600
(Gordon) Very nice,
that lobster spaghetti.

23:20.601 --> 23:21.732
Yes, chef.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.232
- Lobster spaghetti.
- Thank you.

23:23.233 --> 23:24.699
- Real good.
- Ladies...

23:24.700 --> 23:25.931
Great start.
Keep it going.

23:25.932 --> 23:27.166
Let's go, ladies!

23:27.167 --> 23:28.899
We can do this tonight.

23:28.900 --> 23:30.598
(Announcer) The red kitchen's
newfound team unity

23:30.599 --> 23:32.466
has them off
to a good start on appetizers.

23:32.467 --> 23:34.165
Meanwhile, in the blue kitchen,

23:34.166 --> 23:36.432
chef Ramsay is looking
to Paul and Natalie

23:36.433 --> 23:38.799
to deliver on their appetizers.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.266
Risotto, two scallops.
Yes?

23:40.267 --> 23:42.099
(All) - Yes, chef.
- How long, Paul?

23:42.100 --> 23:43.164
- Four minutes, chef.
- Four minutes.

23:43.165 --> 23:44.364
- Paul.
- Yes, chef.

23:44.365 --> 23:46.064
- Tonight is your comeback night.
- Yes, chef.

23:46.065 --> 23:47.233
Let's go.
I want to hear it, yes?

23:47.234 --> 23:49.032
Yes, chef!

23:49.033 --> 23:51.232
I'm hoping that Paul can
do a way better job

23:51.233 --> 23:52.899
than he did last dinner service.

23:52.900 --> 23:54.699
One person has a bad night,

23:54.700 --> 23:58.332
it could bring the whole team down.

23:58.333 --> 23:59.631
(Gordon) Very nice there, Paul.

23:59.632 --> 24:00.633
(Paul) Thank you, chef.

24:00.634 --> 24:01.799
[Bell dings]

24:01.800 --> 24:03.064
Scallops, please, Natalie.

24:03.065 --> 24:04.200
I'm dying.
Let's go.

24:04.201 --> 24:06.333
Coming right now, chef.

24:07.533 --> 24:10.465
First [Bleep] table, huh?
Natalie!

24:10.466 --> 24:12.132
- Yes, chef?
- They're rubber.

24:12.133 --> 24:14.632
Touch them. Come on, hurry up!
That's our first table. Come on!

24:14.633 --> 24:16.566
Chef Ramsay expects a lot out of me.

24:16.567 --> 24:18.599
I would love to just be
perfect all the time,

24:18.600 --> 24:19.931
but that doesn't happen in real life.

24:19.932 --> 24:21.033
Hey, great risotto.

24:21.034 --> 24:22.999
Unfortunately, [Bleep] Scallops.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.132
Did you not see that the
scallops were horrible?

24:26.133 --> 24:27.398
Just be vocal and say it.

24:27.399 --> 24:28.833
"Yo, I [Bleep] up the scallops."

24:28.834 --> 24:30.232
I want it all

24:30.233 --> 24:32.465
absolutely on the money, yes?

24:32.466 --> 24:33.700
- Yes, chef.
- Heard. Refire!

24:33.701 --> 24:35.700
Please? 
Five minutes on the first table.

24:35.701 --> 24:38.032
Five minutes heard.
Thank you.

24:38.033 --> 24:40.564
(Announcer) While Natalie's unsatisfactory
scallops have sent the Blue Team

24:40.565 --> 24:42.166
back to square one on their appetizers,

24:42.167 --> 24:43.699
in the red kitchen...

24:43.700 --> 24:44.998
One mussels, one scallops away.

24:44.999 --> 24:46.298
(Announcer) The Red Team is rolling,

24:46.299 --> 24:47.331
and just waiting on...

24:47.332 --> 24:48.331
- Elise!
- Yes, chef.

24:48.332 --> 24:50.300
- Scallops!
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

24:51.900 --> 24:53.265
[Bleep]. Come here!

24:53.266 --> 24:55.232
All of you, come here.

24:55.233 --> 24:56.699
Hey, look. Look.

24:56.700 --> 24:59.132
[Squelching]

24:59.133 --> 25:01.100
That's the state of where we are now.

25:03.800 --> 25:05.131
I did tell her
right before dinner service,

25:05.132 --> 25:06.898
I was like, "Elise, you
need to drain that salad."

25:06.899 --> 25:09.266
Here's the salad for it.
There's backup down here.

25:09.267 --> 25:10.832
Okay.

25:10.833 --> 25:12.365
As always.
She never listens.

25:12.366 --> 25:13.933
Look at me.
Why is it in the water?

25:13.934 --> 25:17.065
I'm...

25:17.066 --> 25:19.133
I didn't prep the station.
Carrie prepped the station.

25:19.134 --> 25:20.899
- It's in water.
- I'm gonna drain it.

25:20.900 --> 25:22.298
It is supposed to be
drained before we start.

25:22.299 --> 25:23.400
And I did ask you to do that.

25:23.401 --> 25:24.042
I didn't...

25:24.043 --> 25:25.499
What section are you on?

25:25.500 --> 25:26.964
I am on appetizers, chef.

25:26.965 --> 25:29.264
Right, so who's responsible for
draining the [Bleep] salads?

25:29.265 --> 25:30.900
I'm sorry, chef.
I'm draining it now.

25:30.901 --> 25:31.965
As usual,

25:31.966 --> 25:33.765
it wasn't drained for me.

25:33.766 --> 25:35.698
(Announcer) Despite Elise's soggy salad,

25:35.699 --> 25:36.964
the Red Team quickly recovers,

25:36.965 --> 25:38.433
getting most of their appetizers

25:38.434 --> 25:40.032
out to their hungry diners.

25:40.033 --> 25:41.532
That looks really good.

25:41.533 --> 25:42.799
Mmm.

25:42.800 --> 25:44.064
(Announcer) Back in the blue kitchen...

25:44.065 --> 25:45.198
Going up with scallops.

25:45.199 --> 25:47.000
(Announcer) Natalie is ready to impress

25:47.001 --> 25:49.232
with her second attempt
on the scallop appetizer.

25:49.233 --> 25:51.199
Natalie.

25:51.200 --> 25:52.365
Yes, chef?

25:52.366 --> 25:54.165
It's rubber.
Touch.

25:54.166 --> 25:56.232
Rubber.

25:56.233 --> 25:58.399
- Come on, Natalie, please.
- Yes, chef.

25:58.400 --> 26:00.465
The pan's not hot enough, Natalie...

26:00.466 --> 26:02.800
Even from here.
It's got to be searing, quick.

26:02.801 --> 26:05.499
It's searing, chef.
It's sizzling, chef.

26:05.500 --> 26:07.265
- Not enough.
- Okay.

26:07.266 --> 26:08.664
Not enough.
They're gonna boil.

26:08.665 --> 26:09.900
The scallops are massive.

26:09.901 --> 26:11.400
- Not enough.
- Okay. Yes, chef.

26:11.401 --> 26:14.299
You know, it's just really
frustrating, you know.

26:14.300 --> 26:16.100
When I was getting stuff sent back,

26:16.101 --> 26:18.099
I was having to trash scallops.

26:18.100 --> 26:19.965
It's just, like, a catastrophe.

26:19.966 --> 26:21.532
Oh, my God.

26:21.533 --> 26:23.132
Look at all those scallops.

26:23.133 --> 26:24.232
Will!

26:24.233 --> 26:26.165
Paul! Jonathon!

26:26.166 --> 26:28.232
Tommy! Come here!

26:28.233 --> 26:30.765
How many scallops
are we having to refire?

26:30.766 --> 26:33.865
Natalie had to sear off a
million scallops tonight,

26:33.866 --> 26:35.133
'cause she couldn't get 'em right.

26:35.134 --> 26:36.699
This is not gonna be good.

26:36.700 --> 26:38.432
Oh, my God.

26:38.433 --> 26:39.799
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

26:39.800 --> 26:41.000
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,

26:41.001 --> 26:42.432
14... shut it!

26:42.433 --> 26:44.433
15! 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21...

26:45.733 --> 26:48.233
24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29...

26:50.265 --> 26:53.397
[Dramatic music]

26:53.398 --> 26:55.331
(Announcer) It's 45 minutes
into dinner service.

26:55.332 --> 26:56.996
What's wrong with those scallops?

26:56.997 --> 26:58.163
Those are ones I have to refire.

26:58.164 --> 26:59.998
(Announcer) And chef Ramsay has discovered

26:59.999 --> 27:02.031
Natalie's dirty little secret.

27:02.032 --> 27:04.464
How many scallops
are we having to refire?

27:04.465 --> 27:05.565
Five minutes on the first.

27:05.566 --> 27:07.031
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

27:07.032 --> 27:08.232
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,

27:08.233 --> 27:09.697
14... shut it! 15!

27:09.698 --> 27:11.531
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23,

27:11.532 --> 27:15.264
24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

27:15.265 --> 27:16.631
Oh, come on.

27:16.632 --> 27:18.397
We haven't even sent any out!

27:18.398 --> 27:20.164
Natalie, wake up!

27:20.165 --> 27:21.964
I'm sitting here watching Natalie

27:21.965 --> 27:24.064
sink faster
than the Titanic on fish.

27:24.065 --> 27:25.298
Take your pan.
Put it here.

27:25.299 --> 27:26.631
Drop your scallops.

27:26.632 --> 27:28.563
So I go over there to show
her how to sear scallops.

27:28.564 --> 27:29.732
Scallops...
I'm dying. Let's go.

27:29.733 --> 27:33.732
- You need a scallop up there now.
- Yeah.

27:33.965 --> 27:35.831
Thank you. Finally.

27:35.832 --> 27:37.398
Now you got the color
on the scallops.

27:37.399 --> 27:38.864
Stick to it, yes?

27:38.865 --> 27:40.164
Yes, chef.

27:40.165 --> 27:41.732
(Will) Good job, Natalie.
Keep it going.

27:41.733 --> 27:43.264
Service.

27:43.265 --> 27:44.963
(Announcer) After a quick
tutorial from will to Natalie,

27:44.964 --> 27:46.196
the Blue Team is back on track.

27:46.197 --> 27:47.198
Scallops... behind, hot.

27:47.199 --> 27:48.731
(Gordon) Service, please.

27:48.732 --> 27:50.431
Bon appetit.

27:50.432 --> 27:52.698
(Announcer) Meanwhile, the red
kitchen has moved on to entrees.

27:52.699 --> 27:55.364
And the pressure now rests
on Jamie on the fish station

27:55.365 --> 27:57.031
and Krupa on the meat station

27:57.032 --> 27:58.764
to keep the momentum going.

27:58.765 --> 27:59.932
(Jamie) Krupa, how long?

27:59.933 --> 28:02.797
I need... two minutes.

28:02.798 --> 28:04.665
Meat and fish
have to work with each other,

28:04.666 --> 28:06.163
so I was yelling at Krupa,

28:06.164 --> 28:07.498
"how much time?
Krupa, how much time?"

28:07.499 --> 28:09.097
- How long?
- One minute, chef.

28:09.098 --> 28:11.797
My venison's going to
be about two minutes.

28:11.798 --> 28:13.730
That's what you called
two minutes ago!

28:13.731 --> 28:16.030
She would give me times, but
they were completely off.

28:16.031 --> 28:17.496
Jamie, one minute
or two minutes?

28:17.497 --> 28:18.496
Two minutes, chef.

28:18.497 --> 28:19.798
- Come on, then!
- Yes, chef.

28:19.799 --> 28:21.231
Pick it up.

28:21.232 --> 28:22.897
It's really getting frustrating.

28:22.898 --> 28:24.197
Sea bass ready.

28:24.198 --> 28:27.332
I'm walking up with my
venison and Wellington.

28:33.098 --> 28:34.997
Jamie, Krupa...

28:34.998 --> 28:36.531
Come here.

28:36.532 --> 28:40.331
I got one sea bass pink
and undercooked... raw.

28:40.332 --> 28:41.931
And the venison...

28:41.932 --> 28:43.797
It's not even hot in the middle!

28:43.798 --> 28:46.897
What is that?
Come on, Jamie! Krupa!

28:46.898 --> 28:49.397
Jamie and Krupa weren't
communicating as a team,

28:49.398 --> 28:50.930
and that's been the
problem on the Red Team.

28:50.931 --> 28:52.496
Nobody wants to step up
and be a leader,

28:52.497 --> 28:53.732
so I'm gonna be taking over.

28:53.733 --> 28:55.331
One sea bass, one venison...

28:55.332 --> 28:57.464
- How long, ladies?
(Both) - Four minutes.

28:57.465 --> 28:58.796
Four minutes to the window... heard.

28:58.797 --> 29:00.532
(Announcer) While Elise barks out orders,

29:00.533 --> 29:02.931
Jamie and Krupa refire
their first entrees.

29:02.932 --> 29:04.964
We got to pick this back up, ladies.

29:04.965 --> 29:06.165
(Announcer) Over in the blue kitchen,

29:06.166 --> 29:08.697
Jonathon is keen
to impress chef Ramsay.

29:08.698 --> 29:11.264
Got the two Wellingtons and the venison

29:11.265 --> 29:12.698
right here, chef, yeah.

29:13.765 --> 29:15.064
Oh, [Bleep], no.

29:15.065 --> 29:16.664
[Exhales deeply]

29:16.665 --> 29:18.464
Come here, all of you.

29:18.465 --> 29:20.197
The pastry...

29:20.198 --> 29:21.697
Touch it with your fingers.

29:21.698 --> 29:23.464
It's [Bleep] raw.

29:23.465 --> 29:26.364
Chef, Tommy wrapped the Wellingtons.

29:26.365 --> 29:28.864
- What'd you think?
- I think it's [Bleep] up, man.

29:28.865 --> 29:31.397
Yeah? What'd you think,
then, mister rock and roll?

29:31.398 --> 29:33.064
- It's not good, chef.
- Not good.

29:33.065 --> 29:35.164
I'll remedy this Wellington
problem right now.

29:35.165 --> 29:36.564
I'm calling Tommy out.

29:36.565 --> 29:38.297
I can't let this make me look bad.

29:38.298 --> 29:39.997
Are they all like that?

29:39.998 --> 29:41.531
I'll tell you right now, chef.

29:41.532 --> 29:43.697
Yeah, it's... it's [Bleep], too, man.

29:43.698 --> 29:47.064
Yes, chef, the second one I
just cut was just like that.

29:47.065 --> 29:48.064
Oh, my God.

29:48.065 --> 29:49.797
Flour both sides of the pastry.

29:49.798 --> 29:51.296
I did. 
I was doing 'em with you, brother.

29:51.297 --> 29:53.130
We were doing 'em together,
side by side today.

29:53.131 --> 29:54.432
So don't throw me under the bus.

29:54.433 --> 29:56.964
Thanks, Tommy, for [Bleep]
me on my Wellingtons

29:56.965 --> 29:58.563
right from the start... thanks.

29:58.564 --> 30:00.663
I mean, come on, man, Jonathon's
running around the kitchen

30:00.664 --> 30:02.032
blaming Tommy for [Bleep].

30:02.033 --> 30:04.197
If it's raw, that's you
not knowing how to cook.

30:04.198 --> 30:05.864
Walk like a man,
talk like a man,

30:05.865 --> 30:07.332
take it like a man, bro,
straight up.

30:07.333 --> 30:09.531
Thanks, Tommy.

30:09.532 --> 30:11.231
(Announcer) Nearly 19 minutes
into dinner service,

30:11.232 --> 30:13.897
the Wellington fiasco
has created a logjam

30:13.898 --> 30:15.531
in the blue kitchen.

30:15.532 --> 30:19.297
Meanwhile, the Red Team is
ready to redeem themselves

30:19.298 --> 30:20.731
with their entrees.

30:20.732 --> 30:22.364
Service, please.

30:22.365 --> 30:24.198
(Announcer) And now that food
is flying out of the kitchen...

30:24.199 --> 30:25.631
Wow, look at that.

30:25.632 --> 30:27.297
Oh, wow. This is tender.

30:27.298 --> 30:29.564
Two sea bass, one venison, 
one Wellington!

30:29.565 --> 30:30.664
How long?

30:30.665 --> 30:32.030
(Announcer) The old Elise returns.

30:32.031 --> 30:33.265
Three minutes. Krupa?

30:33.266 --> 30:35.031
Three minutes.

30:35.032 --> 30:36.930
We got it, Elise.
Well, if no one else is gonna talk,

30:36.931 --> 30:38.165
I'm gonna talk for everybody.

30:38.166 --> 30:40.631
You're yelling too much,
a little too much.

30:40.632 --> 30:41.305
How long?

30:41.306 --> 30:43.397
I don't know. They won't...

30:43.398 --> 30:46.097
- Three minutes, I said!
- Don't throw it all on us.

30:46.098 --> 30:47.664
I'm not throwing anything...

30:47.665 --> 30:48.965
Yeah, you just did.
I'm trying to tell you what it is.

30:48.966 --> 30:50.331
You're just yelling.

30:50.332 --> 30:53.197
After that, you're gonna
have one cod, one strip,

30:53.198 --> 30:54.432
and one venison.

30:54.433 --> 30:56.897
She's [Bleep] confusing
the [Bleep] out of me.

30:56.898 --> 30:59.497
Elise stands there and yells
every [Bleep] ticket.

30:59.498 --> 31:00.896
Two sea bass,
one Wellington,

31:00.897 --> 31:02.165
one venison is the next two tickets.

31:02.166 --> 31:04.831
I was just like,
"Shut up! Just shut up."

31:04.832 --> 31:06.096
Wellington, New York?

31:06.097 --> 31:07.732
I have the Wellington
and the New York ready.

31:07.733 --> 31:09.964
I'm cutting it right now. [Gasps]

31:09.965 --> 31:12.364
Oh, this one's gonna be overcooked.

31:12.365 --> 31:14.331
[Bleep]. Oh, my God.

31:14.332 --> 31:16.464
Holy [Bleep]. This is not real.

31:16.465 --> 31:18.231
Everything's [Bleep].

31:18.232 --> 31:19.464
Oh, come on.

31:19.465 --> 31:21.864
Red Team, stop!

31:21.865 --> 31:23.231
Everything's overcooked.

31:23.232 --> 31:25.731
Krupa was cooking all the meat wrong.

31:25.732 --> 31:27.597
She was a nightmare.

31:27.598 --> 31:30.031
What are you doing? I don't know, chef.

31:30.032 --> 31:31.832
(Krupa) I honestly don't
know what happened.

31:31.833 --> 31:33.564
There was no reason.

31:33.565 --> 31:34.897
[Slghs]

31:34.898 --> 31:36.232
I'm frazzled, chef.
I'm sorry.

31:36.233 --> 31:38.164
You're telling me.

31:38.165 --> 31:40.231
Krupa, do you want to go home?

31:40.232 --> 31:41.831
- No, chef.
- Let's go!

31:41.832 --> 31:44.364
(Announcer) With Krupa threatening
to derail the red kitchen,

31:44.365 --> 31:45.632
over on the blue side,

31:45.633 --> 31:47.831
Jonathon and Natalie
continue to struggle

31:47.832 --> 31:49.696
to get the Blue Team back on
track with their entrees.

31:49.697 --> 31:51.732
- How long on the bass?
- Three and a half minutes.

31:51.733 --> 31:54.431
(Natalie) I've never cooked
sea bass here before.

31:54.432 --> 31:55.832
But it's just like
any other piece of fish.

31:55.833 --> 31:58.064
And, you know,
I've already messed up once.

31:58.065 --> 31:59.398
You know,
I don't plan on doing it again.

31:59.399 --> 32:01.231
- How long do you need?
- Go ahead.

32:01.232 --> 32:03.064
I'm fixing to cut two Wellingtons.

32:03.065 --> 32:04.365
Fine.

32:06.165 --> 32:07.898
I think this Wellington's overdone.

32:07.899 --> 32:10.097
[Bleep].

32:10.098 --> 32:11.464
Yep. Here it is, baby.

32:11.465 --> 32:13.131
I'm almost to the point of panic.

32:13.132 --> 32:16.664
Tommy prepped my Wellingtons
like big balls of [Bleep].

32:16.665 --> 32:17.932
What am I supposed to do?

32:17.933 --> 32:20.097
That's a little bitty
[Bleep] right there.

32:20.098 --> 32:22.897
Probably going to get my ass
handed to me on that one.

32:22.898 --> 32:23.964
Yep.

32:23.965 --> 32:25.964
Here.

32:25.965 --> 32:27.232
Oh, [Bleep] Me.

32:30.432 --> 32:32.097
All of you, come here.

32:32.098 --> 32:33.564
Ah...

32:33.565 --> 32:34.832
Chef Ramsay's about
to [Bleep] kill my ass.

32:34.833 --> 32:36.964
One, I don't know
what the [Bleep] that is.

32:36.965 --> 32:38.230
It's a little one.

32:38.231 --> 32:39.830
That's my fault, chef.
It won't happen again.

32:39.831 --> 32:42.063
It's [Bleep] little... it
overcooked 'cause of the size.

32:42.064 --> 32:43.732
I realize that. It won't happen again.

32:43.733 --> 32:45.097
I promise.

32:45.098 --> 32:46.532
Just like that?

32:48.932 --> 32:51.464
And, you...

32:51.465 --> 32:53.664
It's raw in the center!

32:53.665 --> 32:55.631
Raw.

32:55.632 --> 32:57.331
You're a talented cook.

32:57.332 --> 33:00.064
Chef, I've got some more Wellingtons.

33:00.065 --> 33:02.764
You and you, [Bleep] Off.

33:02.765 --> 33:05.164
Get out.

33:05.165 --> 33:06.398
For cryin' out... man, I'm...

33:06.399 --> 33:08.564
I'm so sick of this [Bleep], man.

33:08.565 --> 33:10.964
Hey. Oh, hello.
Take that [Bleep] with you.

33:10.965 --> 33:12.397
I'm done.
I quit.

33:12.398 --> 33:14.164
Jonathon!
Come here, you.

33:14.165 --> 33:15.398
You can kiss my ass.

33:15.399 --> 33:18.832
Come here, you!
Jonathon!

33:25.145 --> 33:27.144
(Announcer) It's two hours
into dinner service.

33:27.145 --> 33:29.644
You and you...

33:29.645 --> 33:31.811
[Bleep] Off.
Get out.

33:31.812 --> 33:33.811
(Announcer) And an
overcooked meat by Jonathon

33:33.812 --> 33:35.778
and an undercooked fish
by Natalie

33:35.779 --> 33:37.443
have pushed chef Ramsay
to the edge.

33:37.444 --> 33:38.910
For cryin' out... man, I'm...

33:38.911 --> 33:40.179
I'm so sick of this, man.

33:40.180 --> 33:41.878
Hey. I'm done. I quit.

33:41.879 --> 33:43.811
Jonathon!
Come here, you.

33:43.812 --> 33:45.711
- You can kiss my ass.
- Jonathon!

33:45.712 --> 33:47.011
I'd respect you more

33:47.012 --> 33:50.578
if you told me
before you brought it to me.

33:50.579 --> 33:52.978
- Anything to say?
- It won't happen again.

33:52.979 --> 33:55.111
Don't [Bleep] dare bring me that [Bleep].

33:55.112 --> 33:56.344
Yes, chef.

33:56.345 --> 33:57.644
It won't happen again.

33:57.645 --> 34:00.044
[Bleep] Off.

34:00.045 --> 34:01.611
[Jonathon exhales deeply]

34:01.612 --> 34:03.478
It's just really frustrating.

34:03.479 --> 34:05.944
Like, I know that I can do it.

34:05.945 --> 34:07.544
I know that I'm a good chef.

34:07.545 --> 34:09.844
You can't do stuff like that here.

34:09.844 --> 34:10.842
And I know that.

34:10.844 --> 34:12.143
I get [Bleep] on Wellingtons

34:12.143 --> 34:13.443
'cause somebody else prepped 'em

34:13.444 --> 34:14.810
that don't know how, man.

34:14.811 --> 34:16.143
You're responsible for it.

34:16.143 --> 34:17.612
That's why we got to check everything.

34:17.612 --> 34:19.078
Ugh.

34:19.079 --> 34:20.679
I needed to get 'em out there,
something.

34:20.679 --> 34:22.143
If your prep's [Bleep],

34:22.145 --> 34:23.978
then your service
is gonna be [Bleep].

34:23.980 --> 34:25.679
I'm tired of being the fall guy.

34:27.279 --> 34:30.110
(Announcer) With two Blue Team
members banished to the dorm...

34:30.112 --> 34:31.510
Two minutes on the next table, right?

34:31.511 --> 34:32.543
- Heard that.
- Okay.

34:32.543 --> 34:33.844
(Announcer) Paul, Tommy, and Will

34:33.846 --> 34:36.110
are determined to complete dinner service

34:36.112 --> 34:37.978
in spite of being shorthanded.

34:37.978 --> 34:39.279
Tommy, minute and a half,
yes or no?

34:39.280 --> 34:41.011
- All good, buddy, yes.
- Okay.

34:41.012 --> 34:42.212
(Gordon) Service, please.

34:42.213 --> 34:44.444
- How was yours?
- Really good.

34:44.445 --> 34:46.043
Come on, let's go.

34:46.045 --> 34:47.978
(Announcer) With only a
few tickets remaining,

34:47.980 --> 34:50.110
both teams race
to complete dinner service.

34:50.112 --> 34:52.243
Let's go. Let's see if we can
finish on a high, please.

34:52.244 --> 34:53.409
Let's go. 
Coming up with it right now.

34:53.411 --> 34:55.079
I need one more minute
on the venison.

34:55.080 --> 34:56.811
Krupa, wake up.
 Come on.

34:56.812 --> 34:58.645
Eight plates, please.
Just follow me with 'em.

34:58.646 --> 35:01.278
Garnish is in the window.
Let's go.

35:01.279 --> 35:02.343
(Carrie) We had a rough start,

35:02.344 --> 35:03.810
but we finally got it together.

35:03.811 --> 35:05.879
We completed service.
And that's all I care about.

35:05.880 --> 35:08.411
- Paul, welcome back.
- Thank you, chef.

35:08.412 --> 35:09.644
Yeah!

35:09.645 --> 35:12.511
Well, I think I got my
swagger back tonight.

35:12.512 --> 35:14.344
Welcome back, homeboy.

35:14.345 --> 35:16.579
Switch off.

35:20.445 --> 35:23.244
I'm looking for greatness.

35:23.245 --> 35:26.978
It didn't happen tonight.

35:26.979 --> 35:28.445
So the losing team is...

35:30.279 --> 35:33.644
Red Team...

35:33.645 --> 35:36.378
And Blue Team.

35:36.379 --> 35:38.811
All of you, go back to the dorms

35:38.812 --> 35:41.378
and come up with two
individuals from each team

35:41.379 --> 35:44.012
that you think should be
leavinghell's kitchen.

35:46.112 --> 35:48.179
Leave me alone, please.

35:51.645 --> 35:53.711
(Natalie) My inexperience on fish

35:53.712 --> 35:55.478
that bit me in the ass tonight,

35:55.479 --> 35:57.978
but I'm definitely not the
weakest chef in the kitchen,

35:57.979 --> 35:59.478
so I'm not ready to go.

35:59.479 --> 36:01.611
I don't deserve to go home.

36:01.612 --> 36:02.745
I know I don't.

36:02.746 --> 36:05.178
Jonathon sent up an overcooked Wellington,

36:05.179 --> 36:07.411
so my vote's for Jonathon.

36:07.412 --> 36:09.379
(Jonathon) Are you kidding me, man?

36:09.380 --> 36:11.444
She had 30 scallops sitting there.

36:11.445 --> 36:13.712
I didn't have 30 Wellingtons sitting there.

36:15.345 --> 36:16.877
You cool with Jonathon and Natalie?

36:16.878 --> 36:18.610
I'm cool with that.
I mean, they got kicked out.

36:18.611 --> 36:20.579
You know,
I naturally got to go with Tommy.

36:20.580 --> 36:23.611
I was stuck in the mud
right off the rip, man.

36:23.612 --> 36:26.045
You don't realize how bad that
backed up the meat station.

36:26.046 --> 36:28.043
It's not my fault he
doesn't know the timings

36:28.044 --> 36:29.879
of the foods and when to rest meat.

36:29.880 --> 36:31.844
John-boy [Bleep] up, not me.

36:31.845 --> 36:33.679
(Jonathon) Whatever happens, happens.

36:35.179 --> 36:36.845
[Bleep] This, dude.

36:39.412 --> 36:40.979
(Carrie) So what are we thinking?

36:40.980 --> 36:43.311
We got to come up
with two people, guys.

36:43.312 --> 36:46.278
One, hello.
Obvious.

36:46.279 --> 36:47.679
There's no if, ands,
or buts about it.

36:47.680 --> 36:48.911
I [Bleep] Up.

36:48.912 --> 36:51.778
But I'm not giving up.
I'm gonna fight.

36:51.779 --> 36:53.244
Who's the second one?

36:53.245 --> 36:56.411
I think that we should judge
based off of who chef Ramsay

36:56.412 --> 36:57.878
was really on all night.

36:57.879 --> 36:59.312
My vote is Jamie.

37:00.545 --> 37:03.644
What's funny?

37:03.645 --> 37:05.145
You need to take responsibility

37:05.146 --> 37:06.811
for the [Bleep] that you do wrong.

37:06.812 --> 37:07.878
Yep.

37:07.879 --> 37:09.911
[Dramatlc music]

37:09.912 --> 37:11.643
I had a little bit of water in my salad,

37:11.644 --> 37:13.110
but everything else went out perfect.

37:13.111 --> 37:14.512
I don't deserve to go up there.

37:14.513 --> 37:16.510
You deserve to go up there
more than I do.

37:16.511 --> 37:18.179
First of all, I didn't say you
should go up there, did I?

37:18.180 --> 37:20.078
- You just did!
- No, I didn't.

37:20.079 --> 37:21.145
- But you did. You did.
- But I didn't.

37:21.146 --> 37:23.078
(Carrie) She did not.

37:23.079 --> 37:24.112
Be quiet for a second.

37:24.113 --> 37:25.811
When chef Ramsay said...

37:25.812 --> 37:27.245
I don't give a crap what Ramsay said.

37:27.246 --> 37:29.311
What do you mean, you
don't care what he said?

37:29.312 --> 37:29.817
Can I finish?

37:29.818 --> 37:31.643
Okay, go ahead.
Let me know when you're done.

37:31.644 --> 37:33.345
- What the [Bleep]... what?
- Just let me know when you're done!

37:33.346 --> 37:35.078
You need to work on your attitude!

37:35.079 --> 37:36.644
- Oh, my God. 
- And you do, too!

37:36.645 --> 37:38.345
- No, I don't.
- All right, shut up.

37:38.346 --> 37:40.244
Shut the [Bleep] up.

37:40.245 --> 37:41.844
You're both pissing me off.

37:41.845 --> 37:43.411
- Jamie, talk.
- I'm done.

37:43.412 --> 37:46.011
There's no point in exhausting
my words with you anymore.

37:46.012 --> 37:48.911
Never have I been pushed the
way Elise has pushed me.

37:48.912 --> 37:50.279
I'm done dealing with her.

38:01.845 --> 38:03.111
Right.

38:03.112 --> 38:05.244
Blue Team,
have you reached a consensus?

38:05.245 --> 38:08.278
Yes, chef. Yes, chef.

38:08.279 --> 38:09.579
Will, first nominee and why?

38:09.580 --> 38:12.544
First nominee tonight, chef,
is Natalie,

38:12.545 --> 38:15.078
'cause she couldn't recover
from her bad start on fish.

38:15.079 --> 38:17.378
Second nominee and why?

38:17.379 --> 38:20.544
Second nominee tonight, chef...

38:20.545 --> 38:23.078
Is Jonathon... 
same reason.

38:23.079 --> 38:25.212
He had difficulty recovering
on the meat station tonight.

38:26.679 --> 38:29.211
All right, Red Team.
Did you come to a consensus?

38:29.212 --> 38:31.144
(All) Yes, chef.

38:31.145 --> 38:33.311
Carrie, first nominee and why?

38:33.312 --> 38:35.411
First nominee is Krupa.

38:35.412 --> 38:36.843
She started on the meat station

38:36.844 --> 38:38.045
and just, like, kept getting worse.

38:38.046 --> 38:40.578
Second nominee and why?

38:40.579 --> 38:44.411
Second nominee is...

38:44.412 --> 38:46.679
Um...

38:55.872 --> 38:58.671
(Announcer) Both teams had
to nominate two of their own

38:58.672 --> 39:01.004
for elimination.

39:01.005 --> 39:04.037
The Blue Team
chose Natalie and Jonathon.

39:04.038 --> 39:05.704
And the Red Team chose...

39:05.705 --> 39:08.537
Krupa.

39:08.538 --> 39:10.972
Second nominee and why?

39:13.272 --> 39:15.605
The second nominee is Jamie.

39:18.738 --> 39:21.037
- What's the matter?
- She had a raw sea bass.

39:21.038 --> 39:23.372
But I thought everything
else she sent out was fine.

39:23.373 --> 39:25.071
So clearly, Jamie

39:25.072 --> 39:27.472
wasn't your choice for
second nominee... who was it?

39:27.473 --> 39:29.704
My second nominee
was Elise, chef.

39:29.705 --> 39:31.971
Elise. Why?

39:31.972 --> 39:33.770
She started yelling the tickets at us

39:33.771 --> 39:35.638
when we didn't need someone to
continue yelling one ticket

39:35.639 --> 39:37.237
over and over and over again.

39:37.238 --> 39:38.838
I completely disagree with Carrie, chef.

39:38.839 --> 39:41.837
I feel that Carrie is intimidated

39:41.838 --> 39:44.204
by my assertiveness,
and I felt like

39:44.205 --> 39:45.803
it was my duty to call tickets

39:45.804 --> 39:47.005
when other people weren't.

39:47.006 --> 39:48.571
[Exhales deeply]

39:48.572 --> 39:52.272
Natalie, Jonathon, Krupa...

39:54.838 --> 39:56.371
Jamie...

39:56.372 --> 39:57.872
Step forward, please.

40:01.672 --> 40:02.905
[Exhales deeply]

40:02.906 --> 40:05.704
Jamie, tell me

40:05.705 --> 40:07.203
why you think you should
stay in  Hell's Kitchen.

40:07.204 --> 40:08.672
Chef, I have a lot of fight in me.

40:08.673 --> 40:11.204
I know that I'm a good cook.
I know I'm a strong line chef.

40:11.205 --> 40:14.471
I don't expect you to make
those kind of mistakes.

40:14.472 --> 40:16.937
Krupa?

40:16.938 --> 40:18.705
Why do you think you should
stay in  Hell's Kitchen?

40:18.706 --> 40:20.637
Chef, I have a lot still to give.

40:20.638 --> 40:22.237
And I can do this,

40:22.238 --> 40:24.304
without any doubt in my mind.

40:24.305 --> 40:25.736
How much longer can I wait?

40:25.737 --> 40:27.070
I still have a lot to show you.

40:27.071 --> 40:28.338
I've given you some good services,

40:28.339 --> 40:30.837
and I've given you some
very bad ones, so...

40:30.838 --> 40:33.937
You're just on a downward spiral.

40:33.938 --> 40:35.771
Jonathon...

40:35.772 --> 40:38.604
Tell me why you think you
should stay in  Hell's Kitchen.

40:38.605 --> 40:40.103
When you told me to [Bleep] off,

40:40.104 --> 40:42.205
I wish I would've just looked
you in the eye and said no.

40:42.206 --> 40:44.037
What?

40:44.038 --> 40:45.905
I wasn't ready to walk out
of that [Bleep] kitchen

40:45.906 --> 40:48.237
because of somebody else's mistake.

40:48.238 --> 40:49.937
Come on.

40:49.938 --> 40:51.971
Natalie.

40:51.972 --> 40:54.371
I mean, I-I'm lost.

40:54.372 --> 40:56.103
I mean, maybe you just got
to do the honorable thing...

40:56.104 --> 40:57.138
Give me your jacket.

40:57.139 --> 40:58.604
No, chef. I'm not.

40:58.605 --> 41:00.504
I can't sit here and say

41:00.505 --> 41:02.403
that I performed like
you want me to perform.

41:02.404 --> 41:03.903
I know that you know that
I'm better than that,

41:03.904 --> 41:05.805
and I know that I'm better than that.

41:05.806 --> 41:08.037
I'm not so sure.

41:08.038 --> 41:10.004
This is a very difficult decision.

41:10.005 --> 41:13.305
The person leaving Hell's Kitchen...

41:20.105 --> 41:21.837
Krupa.

41:21.838 --> 41:26.437
Okay, give me your jacket
and leave Hell's Kitchen.

41:26.438 --> 41:27.174
Thank you, chef.

41:27.175 --> 41:29.337
I know you have heart,
but your time is done.

41:29.338 --> 41:33.472
[Applause]

41:39.338 --> 41:41.604
(Krupa) It hurts that I'm eliminated now,

41:41.605 --> 41:44.304
and I'm gonna kick myself for
this for a very long time.

41:44.305 --> 41:47.004
But I have not let
anybody back home down,

41:47.005 --> 41:49.005
'cause everybody knows how
much I fight for things,

41:49.006 --> 41:51.205
and they know how much I have in me.

41:53.805 --> 41:55.138
Blue Team, Red Team...

41:57.438 --> 41:58.705
We're not done yet.

42:05.938 --> 42:07.870
(Announcer) Next time
on Hell's Kitchen...

42:07.871 --> 42:09.105
We're not done yet.

42:09.106 --> 42:10.603
(Announcer) The pressure is on...

42:10.604 --> 42:12.172
(Gordon) You don't work hard.

42:12.173 --> 42:14.437
You don't even break a sweat.
Game over.

42:14.438 --> 42:16.736
(Announcer) As a huge celebrity
visits  Hell's Kitchen.

42:16.737 --> 42:19.172
(Gordon) For the first time
ever inhell's kitchen...

42:19.173 --> 42:21.037
Oh, my God.

42:21.038 --> 42:22.837
I'm, like, speechless.

42:22.838 --> 42:24.837
(Announcer) The chefs are clearly on edge.

42:24.838 --> 42:25.566
That's how we do it!

42:25.567 --> 42:27.205
I would love for people
that speak English!

42:27.206 --> 42:29.904
(Announcer) And chef Ramsey's honesty
is more brutal than ever.

42:29.905 --> 42:31.371
That's already [Bleep].

42:31.372 --> 42:33.705
You rolled it looking like a
pair of [Bleep] knickers.

42:33.706 --> 42:36.837
(Announcer) But one chef dares
to challenge Gordon Ramsay...

42:36.838 --> 42:37.872
I'm not sending it out like that.

42:37.873 --> 42:39.937
Over my [Bleep] dead body.

42:39.938 --> 42:41.937
It looks like [Bleep]! [Bleep] off!

42:41.938 --> 42:43.703
(Announcer) Others continues perform
on their teammates.

42:43.704 --> 42:45.370
I don't want him
on my team anymore.

42:45.371 --> 42:46.570
I tell you, dude, you're
starting to piss me off.

42:46.571 --> 42:47.736
(Announcer) All next time...

42:47.737 --> 42:48.870
Because I help people.

42:48.871 --> 42:50.136
Yeah, you help throw 'em under the bus.

42:50.137 --> 42:51.405
(Announcer) On the most combative

42:51.406 --> 42:53.104
Hell's Kitchen of the year.

42:53.105 --> 42:55.505
I could flip this whole [Bleep]
dining room upside down.
