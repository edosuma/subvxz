WEBVTT

00:10.100 --> 00:12.033
Hey, dude,
we got a problem, man.

00:12.033 --> 00:13.200
Go ahead.

00:13.200 --> 00:16.000
These Kellys
just will not back off me.

00:18.266 --> 00:20.533
Well, he's gonna get
a rude awakening.

00:20.533 --> 00:23.300
I ain't gonna let him
get away with this [bleep].

00:24.767 --> 00:26.033
[bleep] damn.

00:26.033 --> 00:27.567
They think this is their ocean?

00:27.567 --> 00:30.133
I don't think so.
I'm here to stay.

00:30.133 --> 00:31.867
We're gonna move into position

00:31.867 --> 00:33.200
and defend our hole.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.834
No one takes
from me this season.

00:35.834 --> 00:37.667
We're going to war,
it looks like.

00:38.567 --> 00:39.967
Battle stations!

00:42.433 --> 00:45.133
Kris is about ready
to get his [bleep] ass kicked.

00:46.700 --> 00:48.200
Shawn wants a war,
I'll give him one.

00:48.200 --> 00:49.500
He's gonna [bleep] lose.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.100
Hey, water blaster.

00:53.300 --> 00:54.934
Stupid Kris Kelly,

00:54.934 --> 00:57.133
thinking he's gonna
with my guys?

00:57.133 --> 00:59.033
That's doesn't fly with me.

00:59.033 --> 01:01.033
We're gonna take
this fight to them.

01:01.033 --> 01:03.900
This
right now.

01:17.100 --> 01:18.934
A Golden Empire.

01:20.934 --> 01:23.467
It's the ultimate dream
of every miner.

01:25.467 --> 01:27.967
To become one of the giants,

01:29.000 --> 01:31.634
royalty in the
gold mining game.

01:32.734 --> 01:35.367
This summer,
some will look to grow

01:35.367 --> 01:36.934
their gold-filled kingdoms,

01:38.266 --> 01:40.500
while for others,
this could finally prove

01:40.500 --> 01:42.834
to be their time to join

01:42.834 --> 01:44.300
the exclusive ranks

01:45.433 --> 01:47.834
as the known chessboard
takes shape

01:48.667 --> 01:51.834
and the clash
of empires begins.

02:05.533 --> 02:06.867
Big year this year.

02:07.967 --> 02:09.166
I'm gonna get the guys together

02:09.166 --> 02:11.533
and come up with a game plan.

02:11.533 --> 02:14.133
In Nome,
only one superpower

02:14.133 --> 02:16.300
has dominated
the gold mining game

02:16.300 --> 02:17.400
for decades,

02:18.266 --> 02:19.900
the Pomrenke Empire.

02:19.900 --> 02:21.567
Yeah.

02:21.567 --> 02:24.834
And its captain,
known simply as Mr. Gold.

02:24.834 --> 02:27.200
Mr. Gold's gonna get some gold.

02:27.200 --> 02:30.667
Two thousand ounces,
here we come.

02:30.667 --> 02:33.533
Starting alongside
father Steve 20 years ago...

02:33.533 --> 02:35.867
Thanks for the gold, boys.
Keep it up.

02:35.867 --> 02:38.767
Shawn Pomrenke
has become a mining legend.

02:38.767 --> 02:41.333
I've never seen that
much gold all at one time.

02:41.900 --> 02:44.900
- Oh.
- Yeah.

02:44.900 --> 02:47.800
Building the family business
into a sprawling,

02:47.800 --> 02:49.600
- dominant force...
- Whoa.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.166
season after season.

02:51.166 --> 02:53.300
This is more money
than some people make

02:53.300 --> 02:54.300
in a lifetime.

02:54.300 --> 02:56.000
Producing levels of gold

02:56.000 --> 02:57.867
virtually unchallenged.

02:57.867 --> 02:59.333
We're gonna need
a bigger scale.

02:59.333 --> 03:00.767
Yeah.

03:00.767 --> 03:01.934
And now,

03:01.934 --> 03:03.934
he's unveiling his battle plan

03:03.934 --> 03:05.967
to remain on top.

03:05.967 --> 03:08.367
Got a lot
of moving parts this year.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.066
Last summer was about
acquiring all the assets

03:14.066 --> 03:16.667
I needed to take over Nome.

03:16.667 --> 03:18.867
This summer
is about unleashing them.

03:20.734 --> 03:23.333
That land mine
is a moneymaker.

03:23.333 --> 03:26.066
Now that I got it
wrestled away from my dad,

03:26.066 --> 03:27.767
it's gonna make
mountains of gold.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.767
On the water,
I got the Christine Rose,

03:31.767 --> 03:34.033
which is the true
moneymaking machine,

03:34.867 --> 03:36.634
and the new crown jewel,

03:36.634 --> 03:38.467
the Myrtle Irene.

03:38.467 --> 03:39.634
Unlike last summer,

03:39.634 --> 03:42.133
I'll have her ready on day one.

03:42.133 --> 03:44.734
Finally, I'm adding
the Tenhoff's suction dredge,

03:44.734 --> 03:46.567
the Havilah, to the mix.

03:46.567 --> 03:49.200
It'll get out onto
deeper water than I can reach

03:49.200 --> 03:51.233
with the Myrtle
and Christine Rose.

03:51.233 --> 03:53.400
Now, it's time to assemble
the team,

03:53.400 --> 03:56.033
layout to plan, get to work.

03:56.700 --> 03:58.133
What's up, guys?

03:58.133 --> 04:00.166
We got a big year
ahead of us, boys.

04:00.767 --> 04:03.767
Myrtle, Christine Rose,

04:03.767 --> 04:06.100
Havilah's going in this year.

04:06.100 --> 04:07.567
We got a lot
of operations going,

04:07.567 --> 04:09.000
a lot of people.

04:10.667 --> 04:13.900
Off shore,
we got our west track.

04:13.900 --> 04:16.300
What do you think
of hitting on the east side

04:16.300 --> 04:17.634
of that track?

04:24.467 --> 04:26.567
Yeah. Well,
the Myrtle should be able

04:26.567 --> 04:28.300
to hit that next line out,

04:28.300 --> 04:30.333
so hopefully there's some
good gold out there.

04:30.333 --> 04:32.467
- Yeah.
- So maybe we can get

04:32.467 --> 04:34.600
the Havilah over there
to do some mining.

04:42.800 --> 04:45.133
Yeah.

04:45.133 --> 04:47.734
But, I mean, if we keep
everything up and running,

04:47.734 --> 04:49.700
keep all the moving parts moving

04:49.700 --> 04:51.533
and we don't break stuff,

04:51.533 --> 04:54.867
we should have
a smasher of a year.

04:54.867 --> 04:57.967
We should be able
to do 3,000 plus ounces.

04:57.967 --> 04:59.600
That'd be nice.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.400
It'd be real nice.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.734
This year,
I'm going for 3,000 ounces.

05:03.734 --> 05:05.233
Last year, I went for 2,000.

05:05.233 --> 05:07.734
I thought that was crazy.

05:07.734 --> 05:09.867
The only way to stay
ahead of the competition

05:09.867 --> 05:12.567
is constantly pushing
and expanding.

05:12.567 --> 05:15.400
With the money it takes to
keep this operation running,

05:15.400 --> 05:17.533
I'm gonna need every last flake.

05:17.533 --> 05:20.233
Let's get those bolts ready,
and once the bolts are ready,

05:20.233 --> 05:21.867
we'll start moving some dirt,

05:21.867 --> 05:23.200
and let's get her done.

05:23.934 --> 05:25.300
You guys got it?

05:25.300 --> 05:27.000
- Got it.
- Nice.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.700
Get out of here, go to work.

05:30.233 --> 05:33.100
Mr. Gold may be
alone at the top for now,

05:33.800 --> 05:35.066
but across town...

05:37.767 --> 05:40.200
Right off the bat,
beginning of the season,

05:40.200 --> 05:41.934
we're looking
towards the future.

05:41.934 --> 05:43.700
This is gonna be my hardest,

05:43.700 --> 05:46.567
most stressful season on record.

05:46.567 --> 05:48.934
For years,
Kris Kelly and his family

05:48.934 --> 05:50.400
have fought tooth and nail.

05:50.400 --> 05:51.700
Come on, you fat [bleep].

05:54.367 --> 05:57.100
Clawing their way
up from the bottom.

05:57.100 --> 05:58.300
Ah!

05:58.300 --> 06:00.667
With plenty
of wrong turns along the way.

06:02.467 --> 06:03.634
Whoa.

06:03.634 --> 06:04.867
I'm okay, everybody,

06:04.867 --> 06:06.200
in case anyone's
wondering.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.834
But this season,

06:08.834 --> 06:11.734
the feisty captain's
launching an ambitious plan

06:11.734 --> 06:15.467
to vault into the same league
as Shawn Pomrenke,

06:15.467 --> 06:18.600
by establishing
a new rival empire

06:18.600 --> 06:19.967
on the Bering Sea.

06:22.266 --> 06:23.900
I've already been working
the last two months,

06:23.900 --> 06:25.133
12 hours a day,

06:25.133 --> 06:26.934
trying to start
the Reaper Nation.

06:26.934 --> 06:28.834
I came up
on the best opportunity

06:28.834 --> 06:30.767
that I've ever had in my life.

06:30.767 --> 06:33.634
My friend James Barkley
went bankrupt last year,

06:33.634 --> 06:36.300
didn't make enough gold,
so I swooped in,

06:36.300 --> 06:38.166
and I saved the day
with my friend.

06:38.166 --> 06:40.100
And I... Of course,
I don't have the money,

06:40.100 --> 06:42.834
so I had to call
my lifetime great friend,

06:42.834 --> 06:44.300
Kevin Adaimy.

06:44.300 --> 06:46.266
So Kevin came up
with the money.

06:46.266 --> 06:48.233
I came up with an amazing plan,

06:48.233 --> 06:50.600
and we split the Mistress
straight down the middle.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.700
It's almost like a fairy tale
that happened.

06:52.700 --> 06:54.100
All these years,

06:54.100 --> 06:56.600
the Kellys have been
on the bottom tier,

06:56.600 --> 06:59.000
suction dredgers,
just trying to scrape by,

06:59.000 --> 07:01.100
but those days are over.

07:01.100 --> 07:03.600
I'm now half owner
of an excavation barge

07:03.600 --> 07:06.066
just like
high and mighty Mr. Gold.

07:06.066 --> 07:08.400
And that's just the tip
of the iceberg.

07:11.867 --> 07:13.767
What up, Kris?

07:13.767 --> 07:16.700
What's up, baby?
What's going on [bleep]?

07:16.700 --> 07:18.166
- What's happening, brother?
- Yeah. Yeah.

07:18.166 --> 07:20.600
- How are you, man?
- I am great.

07:20.600 --> 07:23.300
Kevin is a friend and, well,
he's loaded,

07:23.300 --> 07:25.967
so he's the investor
on this plan.

07:25.967 --> 07:27.266
He's bringing the money.

07:27.266 --> 07:28.634
I'm bringing the brains.

07:28.634 --> 07:30.533
I'm excited to be here, man.

07:30.533 --> 07:33.033
So now,
it's time to unveil the plans

07:33.033 --> 07:34.433
for the Reaper Nation.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.800
Okay. Thanks,
everybody, for coming.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.166
I just wanna go over my plan

07:51.166 --> 07:53.367
for the biggest season
of our lives.

07:57.700 --> 07:59.367
We're gonna attack
the battlefield

07:59.367 --> 08:01.533
from all sides this summer.

08:01.533 --> 08:03.967
Kevin and I will be in charge
of the Mistress,

08:04.867 --> 08:06.266
and we'll be working with James

08:06.266 --> 08:09.200
who knows that barge
inside and out.

08:09.200 --> 08:10.800
My dad and brother
are heading up

08:10.800 --> 08:12.734
the new and improved reaper,

08:12.734 --> 08:14.333
all built from scratch.

08:14.333 --> 08:16.333
We're using the equipment
we bought last winter

08:16.333 --> 08:18.900
to build a top-of-the-line
eight-inch dredge,

08:18.900 --> 08:21.133
the biggest we've ever used.

08:21.133 --> 08:23.100
It'll bring in more gold
than we've ever gotten

08:23.100 --> 08:24.900
on a suction dredge before.

08:24.900 --> 08:26.300
It's huge.

08:26.300 --> 08:29.800
We're aiming for complete
domination this summer.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.767
First off the bat,
I'll have the Mistress

08:31.767 --> 08:33.600
starting with James's help
this year.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.033
We're gonna be working as a team

08:35.033 --> 08:36.767
and putting that together,
try to find a crew

08:36.767 --> 08:38.967
that we can run 24 hours a day,

08:38.967 --> 08:41.667
and process a lot of material.
We have the Reaper.

08:41.667 --> 08:43.900
The Reaper this year
is an eight-inch operation,

08:43.900 --> 08:45.867
bigger boat,
better put together.

08:45.867 --> 08:48.867
I hope to God we see at least
200 ounces out of that thing.

08:50.166 --> 08:52.400
We'll be using it to prospect
for the Mistress,

08:52.400 --> 08:54.500
making sure we can get
on some big deposit.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.467
How are we supposed
to get 200 ounces

08:56.467 --> 08:58.300
if we're looking for gold
for you, guys?

08:58.300 --> 08:59.634
Because you will.
Don't worry about it.

08:59.634 --> 09:00.934
- Oh, we will, huh?
- Yeah.

09:00.934 --> 09:02.634
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
- Don't worry, man.

09:02.634 --> 09:05.100
I don't depend on you
to do too much other than,

09:05.100 --> 09:06.667
you know,
be your circus routine that...

09:06.667 --> 09:08.066
- I will.
- you usually do.

09:08.066 --> 09:09.700
Don't you worry about it.
We'll still get more gold
than you guys.

09:09.700 --> 09:11.233
You do what you're
good at and everybody else.

09:11.233 --> 09:12.333
I will.

09:12.333 --> 09:14.300
Where are we gonna be
mining at, Kris, this year?

09:15.433 --> 09:17.867
We made a deal
you get on Tomcod this year.

09:17.867 --> 09:20.266
We're gonna mine right
next to Shawn all year long.

09:21.133 --> 09:23.066
Exactly.
And I don't really care.

09:29.066 --> 09:32.367
So yeah, we're gonna be mining
a Tomcod right next to Shawn.

09:32.367 --> 09:35.967
James is grandfathered in
to buying on the Tomcod claim

09:35.967 --> 09:37.600
with no restrictions.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.934
We can go anywhere
on that claim we want.

09:39.934 --> 09:41.266
I mean, come on.

09:41.266 --> 09:42.767
If we're gonna try
to form an empire

09:42.767 --> 09:44.266
that takes on the big boys,

09:44.266 --> 09:45.934
we got to go
where the big gold is.

09:46.767 --> 09:49.433
And Shawn has no idea
it's coming.

09:49.433 --> 09:51.834
Well, I'm not worried
about Shawn.

09:51.834 --> 09:54.667
We're in a race
against ourselves to get rich.

09:54.667 --> 09:56.567
Kevin's invested
a bit of money this year,

09:56.567 --> 09:58.100
and he wants his money back.

09:58.100 --> 10:00.166
And James, you know,
I mean, I don't wanna fail.

10:00.166 --> 10:02.500
I'm a winner. I'm not a loser.
I've built a lot of companies.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.367
You know, we have to push
the envelope a little bit,

10:04.367 --> 10:06.433
and we got to really try
to make this money back.

10:06.433 --> 10:08.233
I'm stoked that
I'm part of the Reaper Nation.

10:08.233 --> 10:09.834
I don't see
why it's not gonna work.

10:09.834 --> 10:11.233
There's no other way to go
but up.

10:11.233 --> 10:13.033
We'll definitely make
our 500 ounces.

10:13.033 --> 10:15.166
I'm excited.
I'm ready to get in the water.

10:15.166 --> 10:17.467
I've been waiting
my whole life for this.

10:17.467 --> 10:19.834
Reaper Nation.
Five hundred ounces.

10:19.834 --> 10:21.934
Yeah, I said it, 500 ounces.

10:21.934 --> 10:24.900
The new Reaper Nation
is happening now.

10:24.900 --> 10:27.200
Fist bump, everybody.
Good job. Good job.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.200
Yeah, baby,
let's get after it this year.

10:30.133 --> 10:31.667
We're at the starting line.

10:31.667 --> 10:33.400
It's time for us
to make that gold.

10:43.133 --> 10:47.800
Throughout Nome,
a clash of empires is raging,

10:47.800 --> 10:51.767
and one salty veteran
is finally making his move.

10:54.333 --> 10:56.133
We're off to the races.

10:56.133 --> 10:59.166
I just got back
a couple of days ago

10:59.166 --> 11:03.033
and, uh, it's as though
I never left.

11:03.033 --> 11:05.333
This summer,
Vernon Adkison's ready

11:05.333 --> 11:07.834
to transition
his booming operation

11:07.834 --> 11:09.000
into a kingdom.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.533
We're ready
to rock and roll.

11:10.533 --> 11:13.834
Right out there is my claim, 56.

11:13.834 --> 11:17.300
There are literally thousands

11:17.300 --> 11:21.567
and thousands
of ounces of gold on 56.

11:21.567 --> 11:24.100
So now, all we got to do
is just go out there

11:24.100 --> 11:27.967
and take our withdrawals
from the gold bank.

11:31.367 --> 11:34.367
Vernon's on one
of the richest claims
in Nome.

11:34.367 --> 11:36.200
- Yeah.
- That's our best cleanout yet.

11:36.200 --> 11:39.100
But it's been
a long and winding road
to success.

11:39.100 --> 11:40.700
I don't see any gobble.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.166
For years,
Vernon struggled

11:43.166 --> 11:44.667
season after season.

11:46.934 --> 11:49.333
Total financial ruin.
That's what I'm looking at.

11:49.333 --> 11:50.800
Losing his shirt.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.300
[bleep].

11:52.300 --> 11:53.867
And sometimes his mind.

11:53.867 --> 11:56.066
What do you mean I don't know
what I'm [bleep] doing?

11:56.066 --> 11:57.834
But, last summer,

11:57.834 --> 12:01.734
Vernon got ahold of Claim 56,

12:01.734 --> 12:04.433
and now, he just might have
the hottest hand in Nome.

12:04.433 --> 12:06.433
I can work 56
for the rest of the time

12:06.433 --> 12:07.467
I'm on this planet.

12:10.533 --> 12:13.700
I'm easily on the best claim
I've ever been on.

12:13.700 --> 12:17.100
I think 56 puts Tomcod to shame.

12:17.100 --> 12:20.533
That's why I'm calling it
Kingdom 56.

12:20.533 --> 12:23.200
I'm planning on 300 ounces
this summer.

12:23.200 --> 12:26.000
Not only am I gonna keep
gobbling up the gold,

12:26.000 --> 12:28.834
but I'm gonna have
some operators out there

12:28.834 --> 12:32.133
mining for me
who are gonna pay me a royalty

12:32.133 --> 12:34.433
to make me even richer.

12:34.433 --> 12:37.133
I've got three or four
top quality people

12:37.133 --> 12:39.133
working the claim,
paying me royalties.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.934
If they're doing well,

12:40.934 --> 12:43.300
I'll be making as much
in royalties

12:43.300 --> 12:45.767
as I will from the crew
of the gold ship.

12:45.767 --> 12:48.767
Hell, I would never even have
to go out there again myself.

12:48.767 --> 12:50.400
But, uh,
it's not gonna be that way.

12:50.400 --> 12:51.634
I'm gonna be out there.

12:53.033 --> 12:54.800
There are some people up here
that think

12:54.800 --> 12:58.066
they're the premier dynasty
in the gold mining business.

12:58.066 --> 12:59.433
Well, watch out.

12:59.433 --> 13:01.533
I'm in an ideal situation.

13:01.533 --> 13:03.433
Best claim on the Bering Sea,

13:03.433 --> 13:04.934
collecting royalties

13:04.934 --> 13:07.100
while I keep collecting
the super gold.

13:07.100 --> 13:09.166
56 is truly my kingdom,

13:09.166 --> 13:11.367
and I believe
by the end of the summer,

13:11.367 --> 13:14.100
I'll be the undisputed
king of Nome.

13:14.100 --> 13:16.433
People sometimes compare me
to Shawn.

13:16.433 --> 13:19.567
But, uh,
he better watch his ass,

13:19.567 --> 13:22.767
because I think
I can clean his clock.

13:31.533 --> 13:33.433
One Fall Fetch is ready to go?

13:33.433 --> 13:34.934
All right. Well, hell,
let's do it.

13:34.934 --> 13:37.800
Take it out for a spin,
see how it works.

13:37.800 --> 13:40.734
I'm starting off the season
with a killer claim,

13:40.734 --> 13:43.867
but my crew won't be quite
as killer as last summer.

13:43.867 --> 13:47.333
Unfortunately, I'm not gonna
have my two Garys with me.

13:47.333 --> 13:49.367
But I do have Bryan Wilder,

13:49.367 --> 13:51.567
who injured himself last summer

13:51.567 --> 13:53.867
and had to end
his diving campaign.

13:53.867 --> 13:55.667
But hopefully,
he's up to snuff.

13:57.300 --> 13:59.400
And then I have Max

13:59.400 --> 14:02.634
who will be making his
dive debut on the Gold Ship.

14:02.634 --> 14:04.333
It's not much of a royal court,

14:04.333 --> 14:06.467
but as long as I become king,

14:06.467 --> 14:08.667
it doesn't matter
how I get there.

14:10.467 --> 14:11.600
Here we go.

14:14.166 --> 14:17.133
I'm pretty excited
about getting back into gold.

14:17.133 --> 14:19.000
We're going out
to the super gold site.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.667
We've been hammering it
last summer and winter

14:21.667 --> 14:23.600
and there's still
lots of good gold.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.600
And we're gonna clean it up.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.066
Okay. We're here.

14:35.100 --> 14:36.767
What in the hell
is going on?

14:42.166 --> 14:43.533
He's got it right now.

14:43.533 --> 14:44.767
They're on my claim.

14:46.967 --> 14:48.834
And I mean the old,
uh, rule of thumb,

14:48.834 --> 14:50.433
if you caught somebody
claim jumping

14:50.433 --> 14:53.300
or stealing out of your box,

14:53.300 --> 14:55.100
you have the right
to shoot them.

14:55.100 --> 14:56.400
Get the potato gun ready.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.033
Yeah, we got
that damn potato gun

14:58.033 --> 15:00.967
and take their heads off
from a hundred yards away.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.400
We're gonna go over there.

15:02.400 --> 15:05.200
And I'm telling you,
he's right on top of our spot.

15:06.533 --> 15:08.567
We're headed out
to the super gold site,

15:08.567 --> 15:11.767
the spot where we found
the sweetest gold.

15:11.767 --> 15:13.467
And there's some yahoo on it.

15:13.467 --> 15:16.066
If they think they can
squeeze out some of my gold,

15:16.066 --> 15:18.166
they got another thing coming.

15:18.166 --> 15:19.767
We'll shoo them away so fast

15:19.767 --> 15:21.567
that they'll be crying
for their mamas.

15:23.166 --> 15:24.467
Unfortunately,

15:25.233 --> 15:27.100
that fellow right over there,

15:27.100 --> 15:31.066
that's one
of my authorized operators.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.967
He's paying me a royalty,

15:35.967 --> 15:38.266
but he's right on top
of super gold.

15:39.867 --> 15:41.100
So, uh...

15:43.367 --> 15:45.166
I hadn't really expected that.

15:47.467 --> 15:49.100
So I told these guys
they could have

15:49.100 --> 15:51.500
carte blanche out here,
and then one of them

15:51.500 --> 15:53.834
popped down right on top
of my spot.

15:53.834 --> 15:56.333
But look, this is how
you expand a kingdom.

15:56.333 --> 15:58.233
You let the workers go out

15:58.233 --> 16:00.233
and give you royalties
from one spot,

16:00.233 --> 16:01.800
while I go out and tap

16:01.800 --> 16:04.000
into a new pastry
someplace else.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.567
The good news is,
there's unlimited gold on 56.

16:07.567 --> 16:10.200
I've just got to find
a new hotspot and get to work.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.667
We have not had any trouble
finding good gold.

16:13.900 --> 16:16.867
We're gonna get out there
and tear it up.

16:16.867 --> 16:18.867
It ought to be
a damn good season.

16:23.634 --> 16:24.767
Back in town...

16:27.800 --> 16:30.734
Havilah
hasn't worked in years.

16:30.734 --> 16:33.000
It's in really rough shape.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.767
As Shawn Pomrenke
looks to expand his empire

16:35.767 --> 16:38.734
further than ever before,
he's unleashing

16:38.734 --> 16:40.634
another weapon in his arsenal,

16:40.634 --> 16:42.967
and bringing members
of the fleet

16:42.967 --> 16:44.300
into his army.

16:44.300 --> 16:46.567
Talking to Zeke
and Gabe,

16:46.567 --> 16:48.266
I told them
I'd give them 10 grand

16:48.266 --> 16:50.667
to get it up and running.

16:50.667 --> 16:53.200
I wanna go check on
and see what these guys did

16:53.200 --> 16:55.767
with all my money.

16:55.767 --> 16:59.400
The Havilah has been dormant
for the last few seasons.

16:59.400 --> 17:01.266
I'm looking forward
to getting it back

17:01.266 --> 17:03.533
into the fleet
and producing gold.

17:03.533 --> 17:05.300
The problem is,
my crew is stretched

17:05.300 --> 17:06.734
pretty thin already,

17:06.734 --> 17:09.533
and so I made a deal
with the Tenhoff boys.

17:09.533 --> 17:10.767
They get it up and running,

17:10.767 --> 17:13.100
they can use it
to mine on Tomcod

17:13.100 --> 17:15.000
as long as they give me
a fat percentage

17:15.000 --> 17:16.200
of the gold they find.

17:17.100 --> 17:18.533
Oh nice.

17:18.533 --> 17:20.100
It looks good.

17:21.233 --> 17:22.400
How's it going?

17:22.400 --> 17:25.200
- Hey, Shawn. Check it out.
- I like it.

17:25.200 --> 17:26.400
It's all pulled back together.

17:26.400 --> 17:27.967
It was looking
a little worse for wear there

17:27.967 --> 17:29.734
for a while. Neglected.

17:29.734 --> 17:32.567
Looks like you got her
all cleaned up nicely.

17:32.567 --> 17:35.233
New power pack, pump,

17:35.233 --> 17:36.634
the air system.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.533
Motors are running okay?

17:38.533 --> 17:39.800
Everything's
running good, man.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.066
Nice.

17:41.066 --> 17:44.500
I'm bringing Zeke and Gabe
to the Pomrenke Empire.

17:44.500 --> 17:46.667
They're already doing
a killer job.

17:46.667 --> 17:49.500
They have the Havilah
looking good already.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.166
It's almost ready to go.

17:51.166 --> 17:52.967
They get it out on the Tomcod,

17:52.967 --> 17:54.600
hit the right spots,

17:54.600 --> 17:56.600
they're gonna make me
a lot of gold this summer.

17:57.600 --> 17:59.700
So we're all going
to the Tomcod.

17:59.700 --> 18:02.400
I think there's a lot
more gold out there

18:02.400 --> 18:05.300
maybe just a little bit
further to the east.

18:05.300 --> 18:07.233
- Okay.
- I've seen some
really good pans

18:07.233 --> 18:08.400
come out of there.

18:08.400 --> 18:10.233
From what I've seen,
there hasn't been

18:10.233 --> 18:12.133
a lot of small dredges
that have literally

18:12.133 --> 18:13.500
explored around that
a whole lot.

18:13.500 --> 18:14.667
I think there's probably
something new

18:14.667 --> 18:15.900
to find out there.

18:15.900 --> 18:18.600
In all of 15 years
I've been on the Tomcod,

18:18.600 --> 18:21.133
nobody has ever worked
that area.

18:21.133 --> 18:23.333
There's definitely
some more gold out there.

18:23.333 --> 18:24.600
- Mmm-hmm.
- No [bleep].

18:24.600 --> 18:26.133
Wow. Okay.

18:26.133 --> 18:28.033
That's good to know.

18:28.033 --> 18:29.500
Let's get out there
and get after it.

18:29.500 --> 18:30.734
Dude.
Let's make some money.

18:30.734 --> 18:32.200
Yeah.
Get that 10 grand back.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.100
- I will.
- Thanks, Shawn.

18:34.100 --> 18:35.433
Yup.
Well, see you, guys.

18:35.433 --> 18:36.734
- Yeah.
- Good luck.

18:36.734 --> 18:38.066
I just wanna go mining.

18:38.066 --> 18:39.467
- I know.
- That's all I wanna do.

18:39.467 --> 18:41.166
There's no doubt in my mind
that we're gonna

18:41.166 --> 18:42.867
crush it out there this summer.

18:43.967 --> 18:47.233
A mining veteran
in Nome, Zeke Tenhoff,

18:47.233 --> 18:49.467
jumped back into the game
last summer

18:49.467 --> 18:51.900
after several seasons
on the sidelines.

18:51.900 --> 18:53.133
I love sailboat dredge so much.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.767
Dude, it's really fast.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.667
His comeback, though,

18:56.667 --> 18:59.333
failed to live up
to his expectations.

18:59.333 --> 19:00.634
One ounce.

19:02.867 --> 19:04.734
Now,
by joining Shawn's team,

19:04.734 --> 19:07.667
he's hoping to be
on the path to riches.

19:07.667 --> 19:09.166
It's super cool
with Shawn.

19:09.166 --> 19:11.767
And I wanna make him some money.

19:11.767 --> 19:14.567
So, Shawn, it seems like
he's just trying to make

19:14.567 --> 19:18.300
his already giant empire
even bigger.

19:18.300 --> 19:20.533
But, as it stands,
the opportunity

19:20.533 --> 19:23.200
for my brother and myself
is a good one.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.133
A deal with Shawn
is exactly what we need

19:25.133 --> 19:27.400
to get going this summer.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.567
These guys did
a really nice job on the boat.

19:30.567 --> 19:33.800
Everything's nice,
clean, dialed in.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.533
I think it's gonna do
really well.

19:36.200 --> 19:38.300
I'm happy with the progress.

19:38.300 --> 19:40.066
I think I picked
the right people.

19:41.166 --> 19:43.867
Feeling good
about this whole situation.

19:45.700 --> 19:46.934
Across town...

19:46.934 --> 19:48.867
♪ Da, da, da, da, da ♪

19:48.867 --> 19:51.066
♪ Da, da, da, da, da, da ♪

19:51.066 --> 19:53.533
♪ Tat tara, tat tara, tat
Tara, tat tara, tat tara,
Tat, tat, tat ta ♪

19:53.533 --> 19:55.900
Hello. I am back.

19:55.900 --> 19:59.467
So, back for my 11th year
as a gold miner.

19:59.467 --> 20:01.467
One member
of the fleet readies

20:01.467 --> 20:03.800
for a triumphant return
to the battlefield.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.233
I had to bail out
for the winter.

20:06.233 --> 20:08.533
Um, I got COVID in January,

20:08.533 --> 20:10.800
and it lingered for months.

20:10.800 --> 20:13.600
I couldn't really do much
physically, mentally.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.266
It was really,
really a weird illness.

20:15.266 --> 20:17.066
So, I had to walk away.

20:17.066 --> 20:18.634
Yeah.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.133
Always one of Nome's

20:20.133 --> 20:22.133
most consistent
gold producers...

20:22.133 --> 20:24.867
Fifty-eight.
All right, man, congrats.

20:24.867 --> 20:27.567
Emily Riedel's
successful mining career...

20:27.567 --> 20:28.834
Whoa.

20:28.834 --> 20:32.000
was suddenly
upended this winter.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.867
I got COVID
and it just completely

20:33.867 --> 20:36.233
knocked me and my business
through a loop.

20:36.233 --> 20:38.533
For the first time
in my gold mining career,

20:38.533 --> 20:40.200
I had to bow out of the season.

20:40.200 --> 20:43.100
Getting COVID really couldn't
have happened at a worse time.

20:43.100 --> 20:45.767
It, uh, really caused me
to change course.

20:46.400 --> 20:47.800
Now, it's summer season,

20:47.800 --> 20:49.600
and I'm really excited
to be back.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.600
Being down for the count
this winter

20:51.600 --> 20:52.834
really pushed me back.

20:52.834 --> 20:54.900
Everything I've earned
from last summer

20:54.900 --> 20:57.533
is, like, mostly gone.
So, we're really...

20:57.533 --> 20:59.800
It's really important
that we get

20:59.800 --> 21:02.400
on some good ground
as soon as possible.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.834
All these years,
I've been able to save

21:04.834 --> 21:07.300
and, uh, essentially build
a nest egg,

21:07.300 --> 21:10.233
and now that nest egg
is essentially depleted.

21:10.233 --> 21:12.333
So it's almost like
starting over

21:12.333 --> 21:14.834
but that's not the only change
that's happened.

21:18.900 --> 21:20.433
Shawty is just making
some new friends.

21:20.433 --> 21:21.934
Oh, yeah. Yeah, she does.

21:21.934 --> 21:23.133
Hey, girl.

21:23.133 --> 21:24.433
Yeah, she does.

21:24.433 --> 21:26.233
This is, uh,
this is my husband, Alex.

21:26.233 --> 21:27.667
- Hey, baby.
- Hi, baby.

21:27.667 --> 21:29.333
Good to see you.
Good to see you on here.

21:29.333 --> 21:30.900
You make the boat
look much better.

21:30.900 --> 21:32.600
Oh, shucks. Thanks.

21:32.600 --> 21:35.767
Yeah, so, uh, I got married

21:35.767 --> 21:37.467
despite not mining.

21:37.467 --> 21:39.233
So I kept myself busy.

21:39.233 --> 21:41.100
- We got a new pup.
- A new puppy. Yup.

21:41.100 --> 21:42.533
Yeah, she's about
nine weeks old.

21:42.533 --> 21:44.433
So we got all sorts
of new crew members this year.

21:44.433 --> 21:45.834
Yeah.

21:45.834 --> 21:47.533
I don't know if this is like
a huge mistake

21:47.533 --> 21:49.333
- or a great idea, but...
- Yeah. We'll...

21:49.333 --> 21:51.367
We're gonna... We're gonna
get her really well-acquainted

21:51.367 --> 21:53.333
- with boat life, either way.
- Yeah.

21:53.333 --> 21:55.600
Gold mining isn't just
about me anymore.

21:55.600 --> 21:58.500
I've got a husband
and we wanna start a family.

21:58.500 --> 22:01.467
You're [indistinct] all primed
and ready to make some gold.

22:01.467 --> 22:02.567
Cool.

22:02.567 --> 22:04.634
It's not just about replacing
what I've lost,

22:04.634 --> 22:08.333
it's about starting again
and going even bigger.

22:08.333 --> 22:11.333
I'm looking for 250 ounces
this season,

22:11.333 --> 22:13.467
essentially,
to start a new empire.

22:15.100 --> 22:16.233
All right.

22:21.834 --> 22:23.233
We're talking
about the future.

22:23.233 --> 22:24.934
We're talking about a legacy,

22:24.934 --> 22:26.867
so I've got a big job ahead
this season.

22:28.333 --> 22:30.467
I got goose bumps right now
thinking about

22:30.467 --> 22:33.767
if it's as good as it was
when we left last year,

22:33.767 --> 22:35.800
it ought to be
a pretty good day.

22:35.800 --> 22:37.667
I've got Rick back
on the boat with me

22:37.667 --> 22:39.367
and he's an awesome diver,

22:39.367 --> 22:41.533
and we're heading back
to Claim 14.

22:43.133 --> 22:44.834
We just hope
that the visibility

22:44.834 --> 22:46.433
is, uh, workable today.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.700
How the water looks pretty murky

22:50.700 --> 22:53.767
and there's a really
nasty little swell.

22:55.634 --> 22:58.400
I might have murked up
the bottom a bit.

22:58.400 --> 23:00.266
I don't care
what the visibility is,

23:00.266 --> 23:02.467
I need to go
check it out regardless.

23:02.467 --> 23:03.634
Let's see what happens.

23:04.834 --> 23:06.667
Conditions are far
from ideal.

23:06.667 --> 23:08.734
In the past, I might have
turned around and been like,

23:08.734 --> 23:10.533
"To hell with it,
we're gonna sit it out."

23:10.533 --> 23:12.066
But not today.

23:12.066 --> 23:14.033
Not for my gold this summer.

23:27.333 --> 23:29.500
How's the visibility?

23:55.400 --> 23:56.967
Woo-hoo!

24:02.433 --> 24:04.367
Oh, that's awesome, dude.
That's great.

24:04.367 --> 24:05.734
Yeah.

24:05.734 --> 24:07.567
Getting a pay streak
right away with Rick

24:07.567 --> 24:09.133
is exactly what we needed.

24:09.133 --> 24:12.634
Oh, golly, dude! Woo!

24:16.467 --> 24:18.233
Hopefully it stays
like this all summer

24:18.233 --> 24:19.834
and we can get
a good war chest going.

24:22.066 --> 24:23.700
We love chunks around here.

24:25.300 --> 24:26.400
Me likey.

24:32.533 --> 24:33.734
In Nome...

24:35.066 --> 24:37.300
a new empire is brewing.

24:39.533 --> 24:41.667
Oh, buddy,
it's great to be here, man.

24:41.667 --> 24:43.033
It's great to have you here.

24:43.033 --> 24:45.300
Can we take you in
and show you the investment?

24:45.300 --> 24:48.600
You're gonna be so happy
with what I got going on.

24:48.600 --> 24:51.667
Captain Kris Kelly
takes his chief investor

24:51.667 --> 24:54.834
on a tour of the burgeoning
Reaper Nation.

24:54.834 --> 24:57.367
I'm kind of excited
and worried at the same time.

24:57.367 --> 24:59.033
You know how
that fuzzy feeling is, Kris?

24:59.033 --> 25:01.500
Like, I'm not too happy
because of all the money

25:01.500 --> 25:03.533
that I've spent
but at the same time,

25:03.533 --> 25:06.000
I'm excited to see
what you spent the money on.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.500
Go get it. It's right there.
Look at this.

25:07.500 --> 25:08.867
This is the big boy dock.

25:10.467 --> 25:12.033
- Is this it?
- This is it.

25:12.033 --> 25:13.133
Wow.

25:14.700 --> 25:17.834
You're gonna be so happy
with everything.

25:17.834 --> 25:19.634
- We're finally here, baby.
- I mean, look at it.

25:19.634 --> 25:20.900
- Look at this.
- Wow.

25:20.900 --> 25:22.734
You know,
look at how enormous it is.

25:22.734 --> 25:24.300
This thing is huge, huge.

25:24.300 --> 25:25.667
Wow, buddy.
Huge, big money.

25:25.667 --> 25:27.000
Let's go on the boat now.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.500
Come on. Show me what we got.

25:29.533 --> 25:31.500
I have total confidence
Reaper Nation

25:31.500 --> 25:33.266
is gonna become a force in Nome.

25:33.266 --> 25:35.200
But running
an operation like this

25:35.200 --> 25:36.767
is part of the song and dance.

25:36.767 --> 25:38.900
Making sure the guy
that's supplying

25:38.900 --> 25:40.667
the bulk of the money is excited

25:40.667 --> 25:42.967
and believes
in what we're doing.

25:42.967 --> 25:45.200
- The raw pieces
are in this barge.
- Okay.

25:45.200 --> 25:46.634
It's worth a million
and a half dollars,

25:46.634 --> 25:48.266
- just the pieces.
- Right.

25:48.266 --> 25:50.133
- This [bleep] right here--
- What is this big blue box?

25:50.133 --> 25:51.533
- A Thrustmaster.
- Okay.

25:51.533 --> 25:53.300
It's probably
the biggest propeller

25:53.300 --> 25:54.567
you've ever seen in your life.

25:54.567 --> 25:56.767
Wow. What is this
rusted thing here?

25:56.767 --> 25:58.900
This is our fuel source
of the entire operation.

25:58.900 --> 26:01.100
Oh, so this is the fuel here.
I see.

26:01.100 --> 26:03.133
You know.
The $100,000 generator.

26:03.133 --> 26:04.467
That's a nice generator.

26:04.467 --> 26:06.200
That's where all my gold
will sit.

26:06.200 --> 26:08.000
You'll be able
to see it stack up.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.800
- Right.
- Excavator,

26:09.800 --> 26:11.266
which has seen better days,

26:11.266 --> 26:12.700
I'll give you that,
but check it out.

26:12.700 --> 26:14.734
That excavator looks like
it's waiting to fall apart.

26:14.734 --> 26:16.433
This thing looks like
it's rusted.

26:16.433 --> 26:18.300
- Does it even start?
- Okay. Look it, look it,

26:18.300 --> 26:19.634
- jump this back up.
- Oh, man.

26:19.634 --> 26:20.767
- Don't worry about...
Don't worry about this.
- This is--

26:20.767 --> 26:22.266
I got another one.

26:22.266 --> 26:23.800
What do you mean
we got another one?

26:23.800 --> 26:26.100
It's gonna end up costing me
more money for another one.

26:26.100 --> 26:27.867
You... Don't worry
about the money, you know.

26:27.867 --> 26:29.467
That's what I'm worried about, Kris.

26:29.467 --> 26:31.166
I'm worried about the money.

26:31.166 --> 26:33.133
This is grungy and rusty.

26:34.200 --> 26:37.033
We're not out here winning
a [bleep] beauty contest,

26:37.033 --> 26:39.166
you know,
we're out here getting gold.

26:39.166 --> 26:40.567
What else are you gonna
show me on this thing?

26:40.567 --> 26:42.967
Everything I see
is rust around here.

26:42.967 --> 26:44.800
Is this a flagpole?

26:44.800 --> 26:46.333
No, it's a ladder system.

26:46.333 --> 26:49.500
This pulls the spud up
from the top.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.467
This actually
was a lot more expensive

26:51.467 --> 26:53.066
than I thought it was gonna be.

26:53.066 --> 26:54.400
Well, how much?

26:54.400 --> 26:55.900
$40,000.

26:55.900 --> 26:57.333
You... I spent $40,000
on just this?

26:57.333 --> 26:59.600
No, we didn't.
Yeah, we did. Sure.

26:59.600 --> 27:02.133
This is $40,000?

27:02.133 --> 27:04.066
So Kevin's
a little freaked out.

27:04.066 --> 27:05.600
Okay? I get it.

27:05.600 --> 27:08.100
It might be a lot of money
for what looks like

27:08.100 --> 27:10.467
a heap of rusted metal,
but it's not.

27:13.066 --> 27:15.500
The Mistress is gonna
make him and I a fortune,

27:15.500 --> 27:17.333
I'm talking crazy rich.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.133
But that's not all.
I'm also building

27:20.133 --> 27:22.166
a top of the line
bigger Reaper.

27:22.166 --> 27:24.934
It's gonna be
absolutely killer very soon.

27:28.400 --> 27:30.233
What the hell
is this, Kris?

27:30.233 --> 27:32.200
What is this thing, buddy?

27:33.967 --> 27:36.367
Okay. Well, you know,
you can't look at it

27:36.367 --> 27:38.133
- and, uh, judge it
- This is how

27:38.133 --> 27:39.800
you're gonna make money
this year?

27:39.800 --> 27:41.600
- Yup.
- Wow, Kris.

27:41.600 --> 27:43.400
I wasn't expecting
to see this, buddy.

27:43.400 --> 27:44.734
I'm starting to worry here.

27:44.734 --> 27:47.467
Is that thing gonna even float?

27:47.467 --> 27:49.233
So I realize nothing's done,

27:49.233 --> 27:50.834
but we're getting close.

27:50.834 --> 27:54.433
We're getting close
to being very close,

27:54.433 --> 27:56.467
but Nome wasn't built in a day.

27:56.467 --> 27:58.700
My vision is super simple.

27:59.700 --> 28:01.767
All brand new
eight-inch equipment.

28:01.767 --> 28:03.834
This is a new to us boat.

28:04.800 --> 28:07.734
So, like, right now,
we're taking an old boat

28:07.734 --> 28:09.367
and we're breathing life
into it.

28:13.166 --> 28:14.533
Where's the rest of it?

28:14.533 --> 28:17.233
Uh, this is the...

28:17.233 --> 28:19.333
I have all the engines,
uh, and everything

28:19.333 --> 28:23.400
but really, I have
to start off with structure...

28:23.400 --> 28:25.233
- Mmm-hmm.
- uh, build the cabin,

28:25.233 --> 28:27.533
and then paint it,
and then put everything in.

28:29.100 --> 28:30.166
Well, so when do you expect

28:30.166 --> 28:31.600
to have this thing
done here, Kris?

28:31.600 --> 28:33.767
Well, you know, the cabin
should've been done today.

28:35.533 --> 28:38.367
So new plan, the way
to get Kevin excited

28:38.367 --> 28:40.100
and more confident in
what we're doing

28:40.100 --> 28:42.433
is get him out on the water
and get him some gold.

28:42.433 --> 28:44.934
He'll be so filled
with gold fever

28:44.934 --> 28:46.667
they'll probably have
to take him to the hospital.

28:46.667 --> 28:48.000
I'm just hoping
that we make some money.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.367
Don't worry.

28:49.367 --> 28:51.166
- Oh, buddy.
- Stop worrying so much.

28:51.166 --> 28:53.066
I'll try not to worry too much,

28:53.066 --> 28:55.967
I'll try to help you out
in any way that I can.

28:55.967 --> 28:57.133
- We gotta make it happen.
- Don't worry.

28:57.133 --> 28:59.533
It's gonna work 100% for sure.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.166
Oh.

29:07.166 --> 29:08.400
Starting the season off
with a bang.

29:09.734 --> 29:10.934
Literally.

29:17.667 --> 29:19.567
It's a dud. Damn.

29:21.734 --> 29:24.233
Zeke Tenhoff is hoping
his plans for summer

29:24.233 --> 29:26.700
will prove to be explosive.

29:26.700 --> 29:28.734
Let's see
if this one will take off.

29:28.734 --> 29:30.266
And won't fizzle out

29:30.266 --> 29:31.967
like they did last season.

29:31.967 --> 29:33.533
Go, go, go, go, go!

29:36.133 --> 29:37.600
No.

29:40.667 --> 29:42.800
I spent most of last summer

29:42.800 --> 29:46.200
tinkering with
the sailboat dredge idea.

29:46.200 --> 29:48.233
It's a fun idea,
I still like it,

29:48.233 --> 29:50.333
but I just ended up with a boat

29:50.333 --> 29:52.500
that I didn't really like
that much

29:52.500 --> 29:55.400
that was too difficult
to operate.

29:55.400 --> 29:57.033
After ice mining,

29:57.033 --> 29:58.600
I envisioned, like,
what I needed,

29:58.600 --> 30:00.333
which was like
a large lightweight

30:00.333 --> 30:01.767
inflatable catamaran.

30:01.767 --> 30:04.266
I ordered a big pile
of aluminum,

30:04.266 --> 30:05.400
a little drill press,

30:05.400 --> 30:08.066
and I've been assembling
a dredge.

30:08.767 --> 30:10.166
I'm ready to go out mining.

30:12.600 --> 30:14.634
The deal that we have
with the Havilah

30:14.634 --> 30:16.834
is perfect for where
we're at right now.

30:16.834 --> 30:18.767
I was back in the game
last summer,

30:18.767 --> 30:21.634
but I just did not get
enough gold.

30:21.634 --> 30:23.100
When Shawn left me
on the Tomcod,

30:23.100 --> 30:24.567
I could start to see

30:24.567 --> 30:26.834
some future
and some possibilities.

30:26.834 --> 30:30.033
After how poorly
we did last summer,

30:30.033 --> 30:31.400
I'm shooting for, like,

30:31.400 --> 30:33.634
somewhere around 50 ounces
to make up for that.

30:33.634 --> 30:36.567
And I've got a plan
to get maximum returns.

30:38.734 --> 30:40.900
Known as
the Mad Scientist of Nome,

30:40.900 --> 30:44.066
Zeke has always embraced innovation.

30:44.066 --> 30:46.300
Copper, whole melting device.

30:46.300 --> 30:49.033
It'll be our first time
running two sluices
at the same time.

30:49.033 --> 30:51.500
So we're gonna have
double gold today.

30:51.500 --> 30:53.133
And this summer,
he's unleashing

30:53.133 --> 30:57.200
yet another of his
out-of-the-box contraptions.

30:58.133 --> 30:59.634
The boat looks good.

31:00.700 --> 31:03.467
Red, inflatable pontoons.

31:03.467 --> 31:04.734
Blue hose.

31:04.734 --> 31:07.367
Pump engines, gas tanks,
air compressor,

31:07.367 --> 31:09.333
basically all my mining gear.

31:09.333 --> 31:11.400
This boat is big
and I made it super wide

31:11.400 --> 31:13.100
so it's gonna be super stable.

31:13.767 --> 31:15.433
I've gotten a lot of gold

31:15.433 --> 31:19.200
with a lot
dredge than this, for sure.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.500
I designed it to be as light
and fast as possible,

31:21.500 --> 31:23.700
so I can do as much
prospecting as I need to

31:23.700 --> 31:25.800
as quickly and efficiently
as I can.

31:25.800 --> 31:27.767
With a small lightweight
dredge like this,

31:27.767 --> 31:31.000
I don't really need a crew
and I don't really need help.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.734
I can maneuver it around
from underwater

31:32.734 --> 31:34.834
and I can tie it
without a tender.

31:34.834 --> 31:37.500
I'm gonna use my rig
to go out and explore

31:37.500 --> 31:39.033
a bunch of areas
of untouched ground

31:39.033 --> 31:40.467
that Shawn pointed me towards,

31:40.467 --> 31:42.734
while my brother Gabe
gets a crew together

31:42.734 --> 31:44.300
and gets to the Havilah
in the water.

31:45.066 --> 31:47.166
First trip out, good to go.

31:49.967 --> 31:51.700
I pieced the whole thing
together by hand

31:51.700 --> 31:53.100
over the last six weeks,

31:53.100 --> 31:55.567
so I know that it's strong
and it's not gonna...

31:55.567 --> 31:57.700
Nothing's gonna fall apart.

31:57.700 --> 32:00.133
So I'm gonna go out on Tomcod
and test her out.

32:00.133 --> 32:02.433
Basically,
I'll motor out to Tomcod.

32:02.433 --> 32:04.033
And once I find a spot
that's interesting,

32:04.033 --> 32:06.533
I 'll just drop the anchor
down and dive down there,

32:06.533 --> 32:08.867
and I can pull the boat
around behind me

32:08.867 --> 32:11.367
and explore kind of
wherever I feel like

32:11.367 --> 32:13.033
the gold is leading me towards.

32:20.233 --> 32:21.367
We're, like, right about

32:21.367 --> 32:24.166
in the center of Tomcod
right now.

32:24.166 --> 32:26.300
It's my first time out here,
it's dope.

32:26.300 --> 32:28.033
I'm gonna go ahead
and throw the anchor down

32:28.033 --> 32:29.266
right about here.

32:32.734 --> 32:34.100
Yeah!

32:36.166 --> 32:37.967
The scary part of diving alone

32:37.967 --> 32:40.233
is that you're underwater

32:40.233 --> 32:43.533
and nobody is monitoring
your pump engines

32:43.533 --> 32:45.300
or your water heaters,
or your air systems,

32:45.300 --> 32:47.000
or any of that stuff.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.333
So if something goes wrong
up top,

32:48.333 --> 32:50.100
there could be
a cascade of problems,

32:50.100 --> 32:51.767
it gets away from you
really quickly.

32:51.767 --> 32:53.400
Is it crazy to do this?

32:53.400 --> 32:54.834
Yeah, possibly, it is.

32:54.834 --> 32:57.300
But after last season,
I need to do whatever I can

32:57.300 --> 32:58.600
to find some better gold.

33:58.900 --> 34:00.300
What the hell?

34:17.166 --> 34:19.166
One of my pressure
hoses blew apart

34:19.166 --> 34:20.400
while I was underwater

34:20.400 --> 34:21.834
trying to get myself untangled.

34:21.834 --> 34:23.433
If I had a tender up top,

34:23.433 --> 34:25.467
then we probably
could've caught this problem

34:25.467 --> 34:26.634
before it got away from us.

34:26.634 --> 34:28.900
This is one of the drawbacks
of trying to dive

34:28.900 --> 34:30.433
without a tender
and dive by yourself.

34:35.967 --> 34:38.667
I can't say I'm not
a little bit nervous about it.

34:38.667 --> 34:40.000
That sucks.

34:53.433 --> 34:54.467
Come down here.

34:54.467 --> 34:57.667
Let's have a company meeting
before we get going.

34:57.667 --> 34:59.000
Okay. Thank you very much

34:59.000 --> 35:00.900
for helping us make it
to the starting line.

35:00.900 --> 35:02.867
You know, now is our chance
to make that gold.

35:02.867 --> 35:04.867
Now is the time
for the marathon.

35:04.867 --> 35:06.333
I know we're gonna kill it.

35:06.333 --> 35:08.767
We've spent a lot of time
in blood and sweat, and tears,

35:08.767 --> 35:11.066
making this operation go.

35:11.066 --> 35:13.433
Now it's time to make that money.

35:13.433 --> 35:14.467
- Let's go.
- We need it, boys.

35:14.467 --> 35:16.367
- Okay. Let's go.
- Let's do it.

35:18.533 --> 35:20.467
RPM's up.

35:22.567 --> 35:25.233
The rollout
of the newest budding empire

35:25.233 --> 35:26.600
on the Bering Sea,

35:26.600 --> 35:30.233
the Reaper Nation,
is officially underway.

35:30.233 --> 35:32.400
James, how long until we go?

35:32.400 --> 35:33.867
- Minutes.
- Minutes?

35:33.867 --> 35:35.033
- Yup.
- Let's get going.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.000
This is crazy.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.600
I'm about to hit the water
with my own excavation barge.

35:39.600 --> 35:41.900
It's nuts. I'm talking
same level with Shawn here

35:41.900 --> 35:44.200
and I'm even beating him
on the water.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.367
This is the beginning
of an entire new phase

35:46.367 --> 35:47.967
for the Kellys' career.

35:47.967 --> 35:49.767
We're big time now.

35:49.767 --> 35:51.033
It's good.

35:51.033 --> 35:53.066
James, let's get going.
We got to get out there, man.

35:53.066 --> 35:54.266
Let's roll.

35:54.266 --> 35:55.367
All right.

36:04.133 --> 36:05.900
Security, security, security,

36:05.900 --> 36:08.300
this is The Mistress
exiting the south wall.

36:08.300 --> 36:11.433
Any concerning traffic
on 72 and 16?

36:16.567 --> 36:17.967
It's a great day.

36:18.934 --> 36:20.500
We're ready
to go mining, baby.

36:20.500 --> 36:21.967
Time to make some money.

36:21.967 --> 36:23.166
We're gonna kill it today.

36:32.767 --> 36:35.634
Beautiful day,
the beginning of the season.

36:35.634 --> 36:38.200
It's a little bit wavy
but nobody else is out here,

36:38.200 --> 36:40.834
I'm leading the way,
and that's the way I like it.

36:40.834 --> 36:42.500
I just needed a good opportunity

36:42.500 --> 36:44.000
and now I have one.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.934
And now, I'm gonna run with it.

36:45.934 --> 36:47.800
I used to live on that beach
right there

36:47.800 --> 36:49.000
and I used to watch

36:49.000 --> 36:51.233
the big million dollar
operations go by,

36:51.233 --> 36:53.266
and I was thinking,
"Maybe that'll be me one day,"

36:53.266 --> 36:54.767
and here I am.

36:54.767 --> 36:58.567
It only took eight
years of my life

36:58.567 --> 37:02.133
to make it to this point,
but at least this is my plan.

37:02.133 --> 37:04.867
So if I wanna be like
the mighty Shawn Pomrenke,

37:04.867 --> 37:06.900
I got to go
where the big gold is.

37:06.900 --> 37:09.100
Why the [bleep] would I go
anywhere else

37:09.100 --> 37:11.867
where I know for sure
there's gold?

37:11.867 --> 37:14.033
You know, like,
this is a multi-stage plan.

37:14.033 --> 37:16.100
If you don't start
where's there's gold,

37:16.100 --> 37:17.867
you're not gonna get gold.

37:17.867 --> 37:20.100
And that can mean
only one place.

37:24.800 --> 37:26.567
Pulling up to our spot
where we're gonna be mining

37:26.567 --> 37:28.333
and finally making some money.

37:28.333 --> 37:30.066
We're about to lower
the spuds down,

37:30.066 --> 37:31.800
uh, get the boat ready
to digging.

37:31.800 --> 37:33.333
And we're gonna see
what this thing does

37:33.333 --> 37:34.500
and I wanna see
how much material

37:34.500 --> 37:36.300
we can put in that box.

37:36.300 --> 37:38.533
So, uh, it's...
I'm anxious, you know.

37:47.567 --> 37:49.600
There you go.
We're almost ready to mine.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.300
We just got to fire up
the wash plant

37:51.300 --> 37:53.100
and start prospecting.

38:02.700 --> 38:04.667
Oh, baby. Look at this.

38:16.634 --> 38:18.600
Everything is going great.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.834
Fire up excavator.

38:25.967 --> 38:27.200
Woo!

38:42.300 --> 38:43.867
- Yes!
- Whoa.

38:43.867 --> 38:46.133
This [bleep] right here
will make a crew happy

38:46.133 --> 38:48.133
and you can smell the money.

38:58.767 --> 39:00.967
Now, I'm excited,
everything is running.

39:00.967 --> 39:02.300
I couldn't be any happier.

39:03.500 --> 39:06.567
We're making money, baby!

39:07.700 --> 39:09.367
Woo!

39:09.367 --> 39:12.333
man, the bucket
looks so good, too.

39:15.100 --> 39:17.967
I knew this was all
gonna work out, you know.

39:21.500 --> 39:23.367
Back in the harbor...

39:24.600 --> 39:27.900
Hit it, hit stop,
and then hit start.

39:32.100 --> 39:33.500
there's another
excavator barge

39:33.500 --> 39:35.500
ready to hit the water...

39:35.500 --> 39:37.333
It all works perfect.

39:37.333 --> 39:39.000
as the Pomrenke empire

39:39.000 --> 39:42.300
begins its onslaught
on the Bering Sea.

39:42.300 --> 39:45.000
Well, we got it all
put together last year

39:45.000 --> 39:47.166
and now, we got it dialed in.

39:47.166 --> 39:49.533
We're gonna kick some
ass this year.

39:49.533 --> 39:51.000
Last year was the first year

39:51.000 --> 39:53.533
I made a deal with Dave Young
to team up on the Myrtle.

39:53.533 --> 39:56.467
We spent most of the summer
upgrading her,

39:56.467 --> 39:57.734
getting her ready to go,

39:57.734 --> 39:59.066
didn't even make it
on the water

39:59.066 --> 40:01.233
till the last few weeks
of the season.

40:01.233 --> 40:04.200
But once we did,
she was an absolute monster.

40:05.867 --> 40:07.433
I've been so excited.

40:07.433 --> 40:08.667
What do you think?

40:08.667 --> 40:10.500
I think it's gonna go very well.

40:10.500 --> 40:12.367
Let's make some money
this year.

40:12.367 --> 40:15.000
- Sounds good, man.
- Okay, let's do it.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.400
We're hitting the ground
running from the get-go
this season,

40:17.400 --> 40:20.500
no sitting on the docks
for weeks.

40:20.500 --> 40:22.700
We got the biggest barge
in Nome,

40:22.700 --> 40:24.500
the biggest operation,

40:24.500 --> 40:26.266
and we know where
there's killer gold.

40:26.266 --> 40:28.734
It's the ideal situation.

40:28.734 --> 40:31.033
This is what
I've been waiting for.

40:32.333 --> 40:35.033
This summer is gonna be
absolutely ridiculous.

40:36.600 --> 40:39.967
Security, Myrtle Irene,
leaving the inner harbor.

40:39.967 --> 40:41.834
Any concern or oppose traffic?

40:41.834 --> 40:45.400
We'll be standing by
on channel 16 and 69.

40:51.433 --> 40:53.000
Oh, yeah.

40:54.567 --> 40:57.300
We're, uh, taking
the Myrtle Irene out

40:57.300 --> 41:00.734
for its, uh,
maiden voyage this season.

41:02.533 --> 41:04.734
We're gonna get out
of the harbor here,

41:04.734 --> 41:07.634
go around, get onto the claim,

41:07.634 --> 41:10.066
take a couple of buckets,
take a couple of pans,

41:11.233 --> 41:12.600
find some gold.

41:12.600 --> 41:14.200
Then we fire up the wash plant

41:14.200 --> 41:16.166
and start making
some damn money.

41:17.266 --> 41:19.667
We're gonna kick some ass
this year.

41:33.400 --> 41:35.066
Rig up that camera.

41:35.066 --> 41:36.967
Drop it down and
see what you're looking at.

41:36.967 --> 41:38.266
To start his season,

41:38.266 --> 41:42.767
Vernon Adkison is on the hunt
for a new pay streak.

41:42.767 --> 41:44.533
So we got this camera here
and we're gonna send it down,

41:44.533 --> 41:46.033
and see if we're on the cobble.

41:47.600 --> 41:48.800
I got my fingers crossed.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.533
I wanna see some cobble.

41:52.634 --> 41:55.100
So what's that expression
about the best laid plans

41:55.100 --> 41:56.800
Of Mice and Men?

41:56.800 --> 41:59.133
We were all set
to get back on super gold

41:59.133 --> 42:03.066
and one of my, uh, miners
who's paying me royalties

42:03.066 --> 42:04.467
is on the spot,

42:04.467 --> 42:06.767
but hey, when you're
expanding your operation

42:06.767 --> 42:08.634
to the next level like we are,

42:08.634 --> 42:10.133
these kind of things happen.

42:10.133 --> 42:12.133
What's it looking like, Brian?

42:12.133 --> 42:15.400
Looks like sandy cobble,
it's like a mix.

42:15.400 --> 42:17.066
Looks like you're right
on the line.

42:17.066 --> 42:18.900
Keep us down there.
Keep looking.

42:18.900 --> 42:20.100
Okay.

42:24.200 --> 42:26.000
This side of the screen is sand.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.500
This side of screen's cobbles,
so this is right at the line.

42:28.500 --> 42:29.867
Usually, that's pretty good,

42:29.867 --> 42:31.433
if you can get right on
the sandy cobble line?

42:31.433 --> 42:33.100
How about now, Brian?

42:33.100 --> 42:34.266
Cobble.

42:34.266 --> 42:35.634
Good cobble.

42:35.634 --> 42:37.333
56 is loaded.

42:37.333 --> 42:40.266
This is a ground
that gives and gives.

42:40.266 --> 42:43.200
And now we're getting ready
to do some taking.

42:43.200 --> 42:44.867
Anchor up.

42:48.133 --> 42:49.467
We've got good cobble.

42:49.467 --> 42:52.934
We're gonna get down there
and start dredging.

42:52.934 --> 42:54.533
We're getting ready
to send Brian down,

42:54.533 --> 42:57.300
but at this point,
he's an unknown.

42:57.300 --> 42:59.700
Last summer,
he blew out his eardrums

42:59.700 --> 43:01.200
and came up bleeding

43:01.200 --> 43:03.900
from every orifice
north of his shoulders.

43:03.900 --> 43:06.166
It was a pretty gruesome sight.

43:06.967 --> 43:09.166
Ah, [bleep] is it bad?

43:09.166 --> 43:11.734
- It's blood.
- Yeah, it's bad.

43:11.734 --> 43:14.000
He's been medically cleared
to dive,

43:14.000 --> 43:16.300
but that sort of thing
can mess with your head.

43:16.300 --> 43:18.700
If he can't handle
the pressure,

43:18.700 --> 43:22.333
I'm gonna be in
serious trouble this season.

43:22.333 --> 43:23.800
Okay, here he goes.

43:30.934 --> 43:32.667
All right.
I'm just gonna go down slow.

43:35.634 --> 43:38.266
Yo, Brian, make some stops
along the way,

43:38.266 --> 43:42.033
get your breathing
under control and equalize.

43:51.300 --> 43:53.600
Brian, just so you know,

43:53.600 --> 43:56.634
we get a readout on your jumps
up here on the screen.

43:56.634 --> 43:59.000
You're at 10 feet right now.
Ten feet.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.500
Copy.

44:03.667 --> 44:04.934
You're in 15 feet.

44:06.133 --> 44:08.734
Take a minute or two
right where you are.

44:08.734 --> 44:11.100
Stay where you are, equalize,
and get comfortable.

44:11.100 --> 44:12.300
All right.

44:13.667 --> 44:15.066
Just try and doing
some yawning.

44:17.233 --> 44:18.667
All right. I think I'm good.

44:19.700 --> 44:20.900
I'm going down.

44:21.900 --> 44:23.667
All right. I'm at the bottom.

44:26.467 --> 44:29.367
You're at 22 feet of depth.

44:29.367 --> 44:32.000
How are your ears?

44:35.200 --> 44:36.266
Ears are good.

44:36.266 --> 44:37.400
All right.

44:39.066 --> 44:40.367
I gotta give it to Brian.

44:40.367 --> 44:42.433
A lot of drivers
would hang it up

44:42.433 --> 44:44.266
after the experience he had,

44:44.266 --> 44:47.033
but he's tough as nails.

44:47.033 --> 44:49.500
And now it's time for us
to get after that gold.

44:51.033 --> 44:53.600
I think I'm mixing
sandy and cobble,

44:54.767 --> 44:57.533
man, I'm trying over here
to see how deep,

44:59.266 --> 45:01.166
uh, down the line I can get.

45:03.500 --> 45:05.500
All right. I'm gonna just
punch it over here.

45:07.800 --> 45:09.367
Let me know
when you see the gold.

45:09.367 --> 45:10.367
All right.

45:21.634 --> 45:23.000
Yeah. There's a piece
of gold right there.

45:23.000 --> 45:23.834
See it?

45:23.834 --> 45:25.200
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

45:26.667 --> 45:28.033
He's seeing gold.

45:28.033 --> 45:29.400
Oh, look at that
right there.

45:29.400 --> 45:30.333
See it?

45:30.333 --> 45:32.533
There you go,
there's one right there

45:32.533 --> 45:34.066
and one right there.

45:34.066 --> 45:37.433
One right there,
one right there,
one right there,

45:37.433 --> 45:39.233
and one right there.

45:39.233 --> 45:41.200
So you find them stickers
on the bottom.

45:41.200 --> 45:44.166
And another one right
there and there, and there.

45:44.166 --> 45:45.200
Oh, look at that one.

45:45.200 --> 45:47.767
All right.

45:47.767 --> 45:49.734
All right, Brian.

45:56.967 --> 45:59.333
Suck it up. Put it in that box.

46:03.800 --> 46:06.367
Well, that is the plan, my man.

46:07.133 --> 46:09.133
Our first diver is in the water.

46:10.033 --> 46:11.433
He's on the gold.

46:12.667 --> 46:14.266
Couldn't ask for a better day.

46:15.166 --> 46:16.333
Whoa!

46:18.667 --> 46:20.734
You're doing
a hell of a job.

46:23.133 --> 46:25.266
Eleven miles west.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.533
She's good to go,
she's a runner.

46:29.533 --> 46:31.800
Despite a hiccup,
first time down,

46:31.800 --> 46:34.033
Zeke Tenhoff is ready
to get back

46:34.033 --> 46:36.400
on the solo dredging course.

46:37.300 --> 46:38.834
My motor is running.

46:38.834 --> 46:41.700
We're good to go now.

46:41.700 --> 46:45.533
Dredging solo is proving
to be a lot harder
than I remember.

46:45.533 --> 46:47.567
It's enough to have to deal
with pulling the boat around

46:47.567 --> 46:48.900
and looking for gold
on the bottom,

46:48.900 --> 46:50.066
but if I have to be running up
to the surface

46:50.066 --> 46:51.667
over and over all day,

46:51.667 --> 46:54.266
I'm just gassing myself out
too quick.

46:54.266 --> 46:57.600
I'm not operating
as efficiently as I should,

46:57.600 --> 46:59.834
but I can't make any excuses
right now.

46:59.834 --> 47:02.100
I have to find good gold
out here.

49:17.233 --> 49:18.467
The good news is,

49:18.467 --> 49:20.967
I keep finding good gold
out here on Tomcod.

49:20.967 --> 49:22.500
I think that this lease
is gonna rock.

49:22.500 --> 49:25.100
I think that there's a lot
of potential here still.

49:25.100 --> 49:27.367
The bad news is, I'm wiped out.

49:27.367 --> 49:30.367
Man is not meant
to solo dredge.

49:30.367 --> 49:33.000
There's just too much to do.
I'm wearing myself out.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.700
I need to find some more help.

49:34.700 --> 49:36.200
The gold's phenomenal,

49:36.200 --> 49:39.367
but I pushed it
a little too hard.

49:40.934 --> 49:42.867
Probably good for me,
it toughened me up,

49:42.867 --> 49:45.734
but when you're deep like that

49:45.734 --> 49:47.467
going up and down and up
and down and up and down,

49:47.467 --> 49:48.967
dropped down,

49:48.967 --> 49:51.033
so your body gets stressed out.

49:52.200 --> 49:53.333
Eight, 10 years ago,

49:53.333 --> 49:55.000
I probably could've kept going...

50:07.600 --> 50:08.834
Here, everybody.

50:08.834 --> 50:10.533
My girlfriend made everybody
a sandwich,

50:10.533 --> 50:12.834
that she wants us
to all do good.

50:15.867 --> 50:17.500
Hey, Kevin, give me
half that sandwich

50:17.500 --> 50:19.500
I didn't... She didn't
make me five.

50:22.767 --> 50:24.166
Okay. I'll take half
of your sandwich.

50:24.166 --> 50:25.433
I'm taking half of a couple

50:25.433 --> 50:27.500
because I just gave
my sandwiches away.

50:28.767 --> 50:30.600
Kris Kelly
and the Reaper Nation

50:30.600 --> 50:32.533
are looking to devour gold.

50:32.533 --> 50:33.934
Here you go, buddy.

50:33.934 --> 50:35.834
On the captain's
maiden voyage

50:35.834 --> 50:39.300
as co-owner
of the mighty Mistress.

50:47.433 --> 50:49.634
Kevin was a little
skeptical at first,

50:49.634 --> 50:51.133
but now he's catching the fever.

50:51.133 --> 50:52.333
Okay. Now, here it goes.

50:52.333 --> 50:54.900
That sound right there
is money.

50:54.900 --> 50:56.634
And that's because
what's happening is real.

50:57.333 --> 50:59.100
Reaper Nation is a beast.

50:59.100 --> 51:00.667
We're heavy hitters, baby.

51:00.667 --> 51:02.033
It's us and Shawn.

51:02.033 --> 51:03.433
No one else is on our level.

51:03.433 --> 51:05.634
I can't wait to take a test pan

51:05.634 --> 51:07.033
and see how good the gold
is already.

51:25.233 --> 51:26.033
How many in gold?

51:26.033 --> 51:27.033
How many colors?

51:27.033 --> 51:28.033
How many?

51:32.800 --> 51:34.166
Too many to count.

51:34.166 --> 51:36.333
Well, that's a great problem
to have.

51:36.333 --> 51:37.467
And you know what?

51:37.467 --> 51:38.700
That's my favorite
kind of problem.

51:38.700 --> 51:40.200
I wish that would happen
to be more.

51:44.066 --> 51:45.600
Oh, yeah [bleep] yeah.

51:46.433 --> 51:47.300
Wow.

51:47.300 --> 51:49.100
Look at this.

51:49.100 --> 51:50.433
You see all the gold?

51:50.433 --> 51:51.967
Because that's too many colors
to count,

51:51.967 --> 51:53.200
you can see there's about

51:53.200 --> 51:55.567
maybe 60 to 70 plates
for a test pan.

51:55.567 --> 51:58.467
So we're on the gold for sure,
a hundred percent.

52:00.266 --> 52:01.900
Yeah, we're on the gold, baby.

52:01.900 --> 52:03.166
Let's keep it rolling.

52:03.166 --> 52:05.467
Yeah, we're killing it
right now.

52:05.467 --> 52:06.667
- We're on the gold!
- Well, you know what?

52:06.667 --> 52:08.166
So right there you saw
a lot of gold.

52:08.166 --> 52:12.300
Times that by a hundred
and twenty scoops an hour

52:12.300 --> 52:13.767
and what the [bleep] you know?

52:13.767 --> 52:16.734
We should be getting something
pretty good right now.

52:19.367 --> 52:22.934
But the Kellys
are not alone on Tomcod.

52:31.133 --> 52:32.900
Well, we're in the spot here,

52:32.900 --> 52:35.100
gonna go ahead, spud down,

52:36.000 --> 52:37.533
do a little prospecting.

52:47.867 --> 52:50.433
The Tomcods' been my life
for 20 years.

52:50.433 --> 52:51.934
I know all the spots
you wanna hit,

52:51.934 --> 52:53.467
and the spots
you wanna avoid.

52:54.066 --> 52:55.100
And over the winter,

52:55.100 --> 52:57.467
we hit some
seriously good stuff.

52:57.467 --> 53:00.533
And that's what I'm trying
to tap into right now,

53:00.533 --> 53:02.700
it'd make a perfect start
to the summer.

53:02.700 --> 53:05.066
All right.
We're about ready to start.

53:05.066 --> 53:08.467
Taking some test pans,
first bucket of the summer.

53:18.700 --> 53:21.934
Right now, I'm trying to see
how deep it is.

53:29.066 --> 53:31.767
It's deep so there better be
a lot of gold

53:31.767 --> 53:34.367
at the bottom of this
to make it pay.

53:38.967 --> 53:41.166
Now we got something.

53:48.533 --> 53:51.533
All right. Let's go see
what the hell we got here.

53:53.900 --> 53:55.967
Just because we're on
a killer pay in the winter,

53:55.967 --> 53:57.634
doesn't mean
we automatically go out,

53:57.634 --> 54:01.133
drop the bucket down
and we're on perfect gold.

54:01.133 --> 54:03.266
Pay streaks can dry up.
They can move.

54:04.400 --> 54:06.133
Especially after
it's been a few months

54:06.133 --> 54:07.400
and the ice has melted.

54:08.300 --> 54:11.533
Here we go.
Let's see what we have.

54:11.533 --> 54:13.100
There are so many things
about this summer

54:13.100 --> 54:14.934
that that's gonna be amazing.

54:14.934 --> 54:16.333
One of the best things is

54:16.333 --> 54:19.300
having my oldest son, Dylan,
on my crew.

54:19.300 --> 54:21.367
I'm so glad
to have him out here.

54:21.367 --> 54:23.200
I can't wait to pass
on my knowledge

54:23.200 --> 54:24.767
to the next generation.

54:24.767 --> 54:27.100
In the end,
that's who I'm doing this for.

54:33.900 --> 54:35.266
Nothing on the first pans

54:35.266 --> 54:37.100
but we're gonna try
to pull back a little bit,

54:37.100 --> 54:39.200
see if we can find
some other color.

54:42.200 --> 54:43.800
You got to get
a different example,

54:43.800 --> 54:45.400
maybe a little deeper.

54:46.767 --> 54:49.567
We could be right next
to a thousand ounces.

54:51.634 --> 54:53.233
It's here somewhere.

54:57.266 --> 54:58.634
Back on The Mistress...

55:07.367 --> 55:08.533
Do you hear the rocks

55:08.533 --> 55:10.634
as they bounce across
the screen?

55:10.634 --> 55:12.767
Like sounds like a train track.

55:12.767 --> 55:13.934
That's money.

55:13.934 --> 55:15.233
You know what? That...

55:15.233 --> 55:17.066
You can hear the money
coming right there.

55:17.066 --> 55:18.800
Choo-choo!

55:19.934 --> 55:21.500
It's called,
the money train, baby.

55:23.900 --> 55:26.000
Captain Kris
has Reaper Nation

55:26.000 --> 55:27.800
firmly on the tracks.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.400
yeah.

55:42.400 --> 55:44.133
enormous.

55:46.734 --> 55:47.734
Okay.

55:47.734 --> 55:50.567
My competition just
finally came to the party.

55:50.567 --> 55:55.266
That's a super excavator, um,
four or five yards a bucket.

55:57.433 --> 55:59.400
That's a big-ass [bleep] arm.

55:59.400 --> 56:00.734
You see that thing?

56:02.333 --> 56:04.900
Look how far he can go
out there to hunt.

56:06.900 --> 56:09.500
They don't go...
Don't make it look like
we're looking at them.

56:09.500 --> 56:11.166
Mind our own business...

56:12.567 --> 56:14.700
You come

56:16.800 --> 56:20.066
Shawn can be super-pissed
we're out here, but whatever.

56:20.066 --> 56:21.133
We got a job to do

56:21.133 --> 56:24.233
and I'm not gonna worry
about precious Mr. Gold.

56:24.233 --> 56:27.333
There's plenty of room
for another empire in Nome.

56:28.367 --> 56:29.533
- Hey.
- Yo!

56:29.533 --> 56:32.000
- So let's get going soon.
- Yeah. I'm ready.

56:32.000 --> 56:33.567
Hey, just don't worry
about Shawn.

56:33.567 --> 56:35.000
We're over here doing our thing.

56:35.000 --> 56:35.867
That's for sure.

56:35.867 --> 56:37.667
And our test pans
look great.

56:37.667 --> 56:38.700
- Yeah.
- Let's go do it.

56:38.700 --> 56:39.934
Let's do it.

56:39.934 --> 56:41.166
Screw Shawn.

56:41.166 --> 56:43.133
I'm not gonna lose
any sleep over him.

56:43.133 --> 56:45.300
I'm worried about beefing up
the Reaper Nation.

56:45.300 --> 56:46.634
Let's go.

56:46.634 --> 56:47.967
These guys are on gold.

56:47.967 --> 56:50.500
I'm gonna leave 'em
and go back to the dock
with Kevin.

56:50.500 --> 56:53.133
I've got another piece
of the puzzle to get going.

56:53.133 --> 56:54.700
- Hey!
- Yeah.

56:57.033 --> 56:58.600
Shawn and I are gonna
be good buddies

56:58.600 --> 57:00.634
working right next
to each other all season.

57:03.667 --> 57:04.767
On the Myrtle.

57:05.934 --> 57:09.100
Not liking
what I'm seeing so far but...

57:09.100 --> 57:10.834
Hell, you gotta check it out.

57:10.834 --> 57:12.867
Nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

57:15.867 --> 57:17.834
Shawn is still
trying to jumpstart

57:17.834 --> 57:21.567
the Pomrenke empire
for its summer campaign.

57:30.500 --> 57:33.500
Looks like the
Mistress is out here.

57:33.500 --> 57:36.767
Kris Kelly and James idiots.

57:37.600 --> 57:39.634
So little Kris Kelly

57:39.634 --> 57:42.533
got himself
an excavation barge,

57:42.533 --> 57:45.900
must have found himself
a loophole to get on
to the Tomcod.

57:45.900 --> 57:47.800
That little punk
is out of his league

57:47.800 --> 57:49.300
and he better tread lightly.

57:50.100 --> 57:51.700
This is my back yard.

57:51.700 --> 57:53.467
I've been here for years,

57:53.467 --> 57:55.867
diving, exploring
every coordinate

57:55.867 --> 57:59.333
and mapping it out
and coming up with a plan.

57:59.333 --> 58:01.033
I'm not gonna take
kindly to somebody

58:01.033 --> 58:02.133
trying to weasel in

58:02.133 --> 58:04.800
and take advantage
of all my hard work.

58:04.800 --> 58:07.700
He better stay the hell away
from my operation.

58:07.700 --> 58:11.133
Don't worry about them later.

58:11.133 --> 58:13.767
Later on, I'll go digging up
all around them.

58:15.367 --> 58:17.634
But right now,
I'm gonna find some gold.

58:29.533 --> 58:31.533
Yeah,
this looks way better.

58:31.533 --> 58:33.133
Look at that.

58:33.133 --> 58:34.700
I think this will be the one.

58:50.900 --> 58:52.066
Oh, yeah.

58:53.500 --> 58:54.900
Oh, [bleep] yeah.

58:57.734 --> 58:58.867
Lots of gold.

59:00.634 --> 59:02.600
My boy has a good
nose for this.

59:02.600 --> 59:04.233
Must run in the family.

59:04.233 --> 59:06.367
This is where
we're gonna get digging.

59:06.367 --> 59:08.634
Not only that, I'm calling Cody,

59:08.634 --> 59:10.700
gonna get the Christine Rose
out here too.

59:10.700 --> 59:13.400
It's time to get this summer
started right.

59:16.867 --> 59:19.266
I like to see smiling faces.

59:20.700 --> 59:22.567
Whoa! Here we go!

59:34.400 --> 59:37.133
How's it going
down there, Ricardo?

59:37.133 --> 59:38.433
How's the gold?

59:40.600 --> 59:42.000
Good.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.934
New bride,
Emily Riedel,

59:43.934 --> 59:47.734
is trying to marry The Eroica
to gold-rich cobble.

59:53.367 --> 59:55.200
Oh! Ow, ow, ow, ow!

1:00:01.133 --> 1:00:02.467
Oh, no.

1:00:03.667 --> 1:00:07.300
But Mother Nature
has other plans.

1:00:07.300 --> 1:00:10.266
I'm just trying
to get back to a place
where I can mine...

1:00:12.700 --> 1:00:14.900
Weather is kind of iffy.

1:00:14.900 --> 1:00:16.467
The current just
got turbo-charged

1:00:16.467 --> 1:00:21.700
and out of nowhere it's like
throwing us over off the spot.

1:00:21.700 --> 1:00:23.900
We just moved like 70 feet away

1:00:23.900 --> 1:00:25.066
from where we want to be mining.

1:00:25.066 --> 1:00:26.400
We're dragging both anchors.

1:00:26.400 --> 1:00:28.367
The current is ripping so hard.

1:00:29.467 --> 1:00:31.533
This might be
a dive killer for us.

1:00:32.300 --> 1:00:33.467
How are you feeling?

1:00:39.433 --> 1:00:43.066
We're so far
off of our spot,
where in Nowheresville.

1:00:43.066 --> 1:00:44.600
You make the call, dude.

1:00:44.600 --> 1:00:46.033
I'm coming up.

1:00:46.033 --> 1:00:47.900
Roger. Okay.
I'll see you at the top.

1:00:58.000 --> 1:00:59.767
All right!

1:00:59.767 --> 1:01:01.634
A nice juicy nugget.

1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:04.834
We weren't down
as long as I would have liked,

1:01:04.834 --> 1:01:06.634
but we got on gold right away.

1:01:06.634 --> 1:01:08.467
And it's good gold too.

1:01:08.467 --> 1:01:10.800
Oh, look at it, it's so nice.

1:01:10.800 --> 1:01:12.233
It looks like a Z.

1:01:12.233 --> 1:01:14.133
That freakin' box looks amazing

1:01:14.133 --> 1:01:16.066
and there's a nice sweet
little nug in there,

1:01:16.066 --> 1:01:17.900
so that's a good omen
for the summer.

1:01:17.900 --> 1:01:19.467
It's a good nugget.

1:01:21.867 --> 1:01:23.700
I'll believe we have
a nice healthy cleanup.

1:01:23.700 --> 1:01:25.567
We're good.
Strong start for the season.

1:01:27.266 --> 1:01:29.333
Get this boat cleaned up
and get out of here.

1:01:32.133 --> 1:01:33.500
One mile west...

1:01:36.367 --> 1:01:38.767
Hey, Brian,
you see any gold down there?

1:01:43.233 --> 1:01:44.967
You're my man.

1:01:44.967 --> 1:01:47.166
You know, after all this work,

1:01:47.166 --> 1:01:49.133
getting all that stuff together,

1:01:49.133 --> 1:01:51.166
it's a pain in the ass,

1:01:51.166 --> 1:01:54.000
but when you get out here
and get on the gold,
it's worth it.

1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:55.800
It really is.

1:01:55.800 --> 1:01:57.266
Despite
the growing pains,

1:01:57.266 --> 1:01:59.500
Vernon Adkison's enjoying

1:01:59.500 --> 1:02:04.066
the seemingly unending riches
on Claim 56.

1:02:05.600 --> 1:02:07.066
Dive of the season.

1:02:07.066 --> 1:02:10.000
Uh, things are looking
pretty damn good down there,
don't you think?

1:02:13.233 --> 1:02:16.934
I think, um, we'll be coming
back here for a while.

1:02:20.433 --> 1:02:22.900
Hitting new ground running,
that's what we're doing.

1:02:22.900 --> 1:02:24.200
With a new hot spot

1:02:24.200 --> 1:02:27.400
and then all these dredges
feeding me royalties

1:02:27.400 --> 1:02:31.033
for working on my claim,
this summer's gonna be lit.

1:02:40.500 --> 1:02:42.934
Brian, um, something's
going on with the boat.

1:02:42.934 --> 1:02:45.033
I say we just drug anchor
or something.

1:03:06.734 --> 1:03:08.800
I'm going... At this point,
I'm gonna stall it.

1:03:08.800 --> 1:03:10.467
It's time for you to come up.

1:03:13.734 --> 1:03:14.734
All right.

1:03:16.166 --> 1:03:17.767
I'll tell you,
I'mma dive,

1:03:17.767 --> 1:03:19.667
I'm sure you put gold
in the box.

1:03:24.266 --> 1:03:26.233
Weather's getting rough.

1:03:26.233 --> 1:03:28.333
We got a long season
ahead of us.

1:03:28.333 --> 1:03:30.367
I'm not taking
any chances with Brian.

1:03:30.367 --> 1:03:32.533
We gotta keep those
ear drums kosher.

1:03:39.533 --> 1:03:41.567
All right. Any... Anything?

1:03:41.567 --> 1:03:44.000
- Any blood shooting out
of any of that--
- No. No blood this time.

1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:46.166
That's good...

1:03:46.166 --> 1:03:47.400
A beautiful sight.

1:03:47.400 --> 1:03:51.033
There's no blood
coming out of the ears,
or eyes, or nose.

1:03:51.567 --> 1:03:52.667
Woo.

1:03:52.667 --> 1:03:54.467
With day one in the books,

1:03:54.467 --> 1:03:56.767
I'm on my way
to the best season of my life.

1:03:56.767 --> 1:03:58.333
I can feel it.

1:03:58.333 --> 1:04:00.967
All in all, today went good.

1:04:00.967 --> 1:04:03.133
There's nothing like
taking it to the limit.

1:04:04.767 --> 1:04:06.233
Good to be back.

1:04:09.133 --> 1:04:11.033
12 miles west.

1:04:17.934 --> 1:04:20.867
Looking good.

1:04:20.867 --> 1:04:23.400
Oh, there are
some cobble in there.

1:04:23.400 --> 1:04:25.266
We're making gold right now.

1:04:25.266 --> 1:04:27.934
Mr. Gold
is once again

1:04:27.934 --> 1:04:29.500
living up to his name.

1:04:30.734 --> 1:04:32.166
Hell, yeah.

1:04:32.166 --> 1:04:35.166
We're firing on
all cylinders today.

1:04:35.166 --> 1:04:37.033
And joining in
on the fun.

1:04:37.033 --> 1:04:40.066
That's some good-looking
pay there, boy.

1:04:40.066 --> 1:04:44.200
Cody Moen,
mans the Christine Rose
only half a mile away.

1:04:44.200 --> 1:04:46.266
Sure on some
good-looking material.

1:04:46.266 --> 1:04:47.467
That's a bonus.

1:04:50.467 --> 1:04:53.166
Christine Rose,
Myrtle Irene.

1:04:53.166 --> 1:04:55.667
We're having a party.

1:04:55.667 --> 1:04:58.967
The only one that wasn't
really invited was Kris.

1:05:00.700 --> 1:05:02.567
Hey, dude,
we got a problem here.

1:05:02.567 --> 1:05:03.767
Yeah, go ahead.

1:05:03.767 --> 1:05:06.100
These Kellys just
will not back off me.

1:05:09.300 --> 1:05:12.133
I can't [bleep] believe
this [bleep].

1:05:13.600 --> 1:05:17.166
Kris and his family
have been a pain in my ass
for years.

1:05:17.166 --> 1:05:18.867
Are you [bleep] with me?

1:05:18.867 --> 1:05:20.834
Did you guys come find this?

1:05:20.834 --> 1:05:23.900
- Dude, you're over there, son.
- I'm gonna follow you
wherever you go.

1:05:27.934 --> 1:05:29.033
Have a good day, Shawn.

1:05:32.033 --> 1:05:35.700
I know James
has paperwork in
for the Tomcod.

1:05:35.700 --> 1:05:37.967
But here's the thing,
this claim is massive.

1:05:37.967 --> 1:05:40.834
Kris could mine anywhere
and I wouldn't even see him.

1:05:40.834 --> 1:05:42.567
But that's not the case.

1:05:42.567 --> 1:05:43.634
What's he doing?

1:05:43.634 --> 1:05:46.667
Gonna come jump on top of us.

1:05:46.667 --> 1:05:50.600
And I'm the guy that knows
where the gold's at
on the Tomcod.

1:05:50.600 --> 1:05:52.867
I've done the work,
I've done the research,

1:05:52.867 --> 1:05:55.333
and now he's just trying
to be a little parasite.

1:05:56.834 --> 1:06:00.133
Well, he is gonna get
a rude awakening
the next time I see him.

1:06:00.133 --> 1:06:02.200
I ain't gonna let him
get away with this [bleep].

1:06:02.200 --> 1:06:03.734
Yeah, they're
out of their element, man.

1:06:03.734 --> 1:06:05.433
They need to back off.

1:06:05.433 --> 1:06:06.967
There's plenty of
ground out here

1:06:06.967 --> 1:06:09.867
for everybody to mine
a good distance

1:06:09.867 --> 1:06:11.934
away from each other
and everybody be profitable.

1:06:11.934 --> 1:06:16.700
There's no reason for this
whatever [bleep] 10-4.

1:06:16.700 --> 1:06:18.166
Yeah, 10-4.

1:06:20.867 --> 1:06:23.333
And not like I got enough
to worry about,

1:06:23.333 --> 1:06:27.667
and got to worry about
everybody jumping
on top of me.

1:06:27.667 --> 1:06:30.333
I've [bleep] had
like this happened before,

1:06:30.333 --> 1:06:35.500
but I just deal with it
but it just gets frustrating.

1:06:35.500 --> 1:06:37.000
Spend all day, you know,

1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:39.133
thousands and thousands
of dollars

1:06:39.133 --> 1:06:42.200
in fuel and labor,
coming out here

1:06:42.200 --> 1:06:43.700
prospect all day,

1:06:43.700 --> 1:06:45.800
and then there's somebody
set up on your hole

1:06:45.800 --> 1:06:47.400
'cause they don't
wanna do the work

1:06:47.400 --> 1:06:51.200
to find the gold
and just pisses you off.

1:06:55.867 --> 1:06:57.800
I need to put
some gold in the box.

1:06:57.800 --> 1:07:00.700
I got all these guys, and fuel,

1:07:00.700 --> 1:07:04.000
and insurance,
and payment on the claim.

1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:05.800
There's royalty payment.

1:07:09.200 --> 1:07:10.567
I have to make gold.

1:07:11.600 --> 1:07:13.634
So I wanna just not worry about

1:07:13.634 --> 1:07:16.500
these other guys
and do what I need to do.

1:07:22.200 --> 1:07:24.133
I think
we are in the water.

1:07:24.133 --> 1:07:26.333
That's a good day.

1:07:26.333 --> 1:07:30.033
I mean, these guys are close
and it really piss you off.

1:07:30.033 --> 1:07:33.500
But Kris, he just
pushing his luck with me,

1:07:33.500 --> 1:07:36.266
he has been for years.

1:07:36.266 --> 1:07:39.400
He needs a good ass-kicking
is all he needs.

1:07:46.734 --> 1:07:47.734
What do you think
there, Brian?

1:07:47.734 --> 1:07:49.667
I mean, we got
a pretty good day of dredging

1:07:49.667 --> 1:07:50.900
and you were seeing gold.

1:07:50.900 --> 1:07:53.333
So I saw some chunkies
that might add up.

1:07:53.333 --> 1:07:56.834
Vernon Adkison
is looking for his first bite

1:07:56.834 --> 1:07:59.200
of the golden apple
this summer.

1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:01.567
Only one way to find out,
let's clean it up.

1:08:05.266 --> 1:08:08.133
We had to call an audible
on the first day,

1:08:08.133 --> 1:08:09.634
find a new pay streak

1:08:09.634 --> 1:08:11.533
and find a new pay streak
we did.

1:08:11.533 --> 1:08:13.734
And it looks pretty damn good.

1:08:13.734 --> 1:08:16.033
Great way to start the summer.

1:08:16.033 --> 1:08:19.634
Yeah, this is the best part of
the whole process right here.

1:08:19.634 --> 1:08:21.667
This is when you see the payoff

1:08:21.667 --> 1:08:24.233
for all your effort
and hard work.

1:08:24.233 --> 1:08:26.033
Well, maybe they're
a little bit better
than I thought.

1:08:26.033 --> 1:08:28.600
I'll tell you,
that's a pretty tasty little
pile of gold right there.

1:08:28.600 --> 1:08:29.400
Yeah.

1:08:31.500 --> 1:08:32.333
Well, let's pour it up.

1:08:32.333 --> 1:08:33.166
See what we got.

1:08:38.033 --> 1:08:41.300
Call it up, three, four, five.

1:08:42.367 --> 1:08:44.333
6.3.

1:08:45.233 --> 1:08:47.734
- Good days' wages.
- Oh, yeah.

1:08:47.734 --> 1:08:51.967
6.37 ounces
is worth over $11,000.

1:08:51.967 --> 1:08:55.033
Not too shabby
for a shortened dive.

1:08:55.033 --> 1:08:56.333
So we didn't get down
a full day.

1:08:56.333 --> 1:08:59.400
Only one diver down.
I'll take it.

1:08:59.400 --> 1:09:00.700
It's a decent start.

1:09:00.700 --> 1:09:02.634
We're just getting going.

1:09:02.634 --> 1:09:06.333
It's a good sign that the gold
is still waiting for us on 56.

1:09:06.333 --> 1:09:08.400
Now we just need to
put in the hours

1:09:08.400 --> 1:09:10.066
and the kingdom is in the bag.

1:09:10.066 --> 1:09:10.967
All right.

1:09:10.967 --> 1:09:13.734
It's not yippee-ki-yay
but I'll take it.

1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:17.333
Ain't bad for a one-day haul.

1:09:18.667 --> 1:09:20.100
On the
outskirts of town.

1:09:23.133 --> 1:09:24.400
Cleanup time.

1:09:24.400 --> 1:09:27.000
How many cleanups
have you done
in your shower, Rick?

1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:28.233
A few.

1:09:28.233 --> 1:09:29.667
A few?

1:09:29.667 --> 1:09:32.467
It's Emily Riedel's
first cleanout
in nearly a year.

1:09:32.467 --> 1:09:33.400
Nice.

1:09:33.400 --> 1:09:34.500
See how the box looked like

1:09:34.500 --> 1:09:37.700
it was pretty well distributed.

1:09:37.700 --> 1:09:41.300
And she's looking
to make up for lost time.

1:09:41.300 --> 1:09:43.133
This is the last
little bit for the cube

1:09:43.133 --> 1:09:44.767
and then, um,
we'll, uh, be ready

1:09:44.767 --> 1:09:47.367
for the finishing stages here.

1:09:48.567 --> 1:09:49.734
I'm not delusional.

1:09:49.734 --> 1:09:51.700
I know I've got
a lot of work to do

1:09:51.700 --> 1:09:53.467
to get back everything
I've lost.

1:09:53.467 --> 1:09:56.066
We have a little bit
of a trough going.

1:09:56.066 --> 1:09:58.133
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

1:09:58.133 --> 1:10:01.533
And build up the bank roll
to at least 250 ounces

1:10:01.533 --> 1:10:03.333
for, uh, me and my husband,

1:10:03.333 --> 1:10:05.700
and our future plans
depends on it.

1:10:06.900 --> 1:10:08.300
First cleanup of the trip.

1:10:08.300 --> 1:10:09.967
All right.
Let's see how we did.

1:10:10.634 --> 1:10:14.166
Two, six, nine,

1:10:14.166 --> 1:10:16.033
11, 12,

1:10:16.033 --> 1:10:18.233
13, 14, 15, 16.

1:10:18.233 --> 1:10:20.567
Sixteen.

1:10:20.567 --> 1:10:24.367
Is it 17, 18...

1:10:24.367 --> 1:10:26.767
18.35.

1:10:26.767 --> 1:10:28.734
- Yeah.
- Woo-hoo!

1:10:28.734 --> 1:10:33.834
18.35 ounces
is worth over $33,000

1:10:33.834 --> 1:10:37.200
and Emily started the season
with a major statement.

1:10:37.667 --> 1:10:39.367
Doing pretty good.

1:10:39.367 --> 1:10:40.500
It's awesome.

1:10:40.500 --> 1:10:41.767
Not a bad first cleanout.

1:10:41.767 --> 1:10:43.066
- Yeah.
- We're in over an ounce,
an hour a grand.

1:10:43.066 --> 1:10:44.634
Yeah. I'm down with that.

1:10:44.634 --> 1:10:46.467
We need to stick out there
for a while.

1:10:46.467 --> 1:10:48.500
If it's this good
on a shortened dive,

1:10:48.500 --> 1:10:50.266
then the gold must be amazing.

1:10:50.266 --> 1:10:52.834
I'm shaking off the rust
and we're off and running.

1:10:52.834 --> 1:10:54.066
- Bam!
- Bam!

1:10:54.066 --> 1:10:55.133
Bam!

1:10:57.066 --> 1:10:58.500
Good first start, guys.

1:11:01.567 --> 1:11:02.667
Back in Nome.

1:11:04.767 --> 1:11:06.033
We need to
get this up and running.

1:11:06.033 --> 1:11:07.533
- I mean--
- We will.

1:11:07.533 --> 1:11:10.734
Two extra feet puts us
in a whole other little area
that nobody's mined.

1:11:10.734 --> 1:11:12.200
Look at how new
this thing looks.

1:11:12.200 --> 1:11:13.467
It's gonna be great.

1:11:13.467 --> 1:11:17.066
Ah, the life
of a gold mining mogul

1:11:17.066 --> 1:11:20.367
with the Mistress
already on Tomcod gold

1:11:20.367 --> 1:11:22.667
and Father Brad
and brother Andy

1:11:22.667 --> 1:11:24.667
putting the extensive
final touches

1:11:24.667 --> 1:11:26.133
on the new Reaper.

1:11:26.133 --> 1:11:28.000
It's time for Captain Kris

1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:32.266
to check in on
his newly purchased
upgraded excavator.

1:11:32.266 --> 1:11:36.567
This machine right here
will give me an extra
half a yard per scoop.

1:11:36.567 --> 1:11:38.200
So it's like doing the same job

1:11:38.200 --> 1:11:41.033
but getting a 30% raise all day.

1:11:41.033 --> 1:11:42.967
I love 30% extra.

1:11:48.567 --> 1:11:50.400
James, what's up, man?

1:11:50.400 --> 1:11:52.634
Oh, dude,
we're on hot gold

1:11:52.634 --> 1:11:55.433
but we got a little bit
of an issue, man.

1:11:55.433 --> 1:11:57.000
Okay, what's going on?

1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.600
Um, I got
the Christine Rose probably

1:11:59.600 --> 1:12:01.800
maybe 40 yards from me.

1:12:01.800 --> 1:12:03.900
They're
interrupting our lines,

1:12:03.900 --> 1:12:05.667
jumping like right on our spot.

1:12:05.667 --> 1:12:07.433
Dude.

1:12:07.433 --> 1:12:10.333
What the
is going on out there?

1:12:10.333 --> 1:12:11.834
Dude,
it's [bleep] stupid.

1:12:11.834 --> 1:12:13.700
They're supposed to be
900 feet away.

1:12:13.700 --> 1:12:16.033
That's [bleep] regulation,
that's law.

1:12:16.033 --> 1:12:18.066
They're [bleep] right
in my [bleep] dive zone.

1:12:18.066 --> 1:12:21.967
They're off one of my buoys
jumped my buoy.

1:12:21.967 --> 1:12:23.300
Dude, I'm gonna
get down there.

1:12:23.300 --> 1:12:24.500
I'm gonna get on the skiff

1:12:24.500 --> 1:12:26.600
and I'll be there
in like 30 minutes.

1:12:26.600 --> 1:12:28.066
All right.
'Cause I'm
pissed, man.

1:12:28.066 --> 1:12:29.533
This is [bleep] stupid.

1:12:29.533 --> 1:12:31.066
Yeah, this is stupid.

1:12:31.066 --> 1:12:33.066
Stay on gold
'cause that's our concern

1:12:33.066 --> 1:12:35.133
right now is staying on gold.

1:12:35.133 --> 1:12:38.266
You know,
we've worked really hard
to get to this place.

1:12:38.266 --> 1:12:40.634
We don't need Shawn
trying to bully us.

1:12:40.634 --> 1:12:43.834
You know, like we'll
run right over
that little barge.

1:12:43.834 --> 1:12:45.100
Oh, no [bleep] dude,

1:12:45.100 --> 1:12:47.033
I'm gonna [bleep] flood
their box full of water

1:12:47.033 --> 1:12:48.767
and blow out all their gold.

1:12:48.767 --> 1:12:50.634
Okay.
Look, don't do anything rash.

1:12:50.634 --> 1:12:52.533
I'll be there
in 20 minutes, okay?

1:12:52.533 --> 1:12:54.567
Don't do anything rash.

1:12:54.567 --> 1:12:56.467
So basically
Shawn's messing with us,

1:12:56.467 --> 1:12:58.934
trying to intimidate us.

1:12:58.934 --> 1:13:01.533
He thinks he's the big player
up here in Nome.

1:13:01.533 --> 1:13:03.300
And he thinks
I'm supposed to run away

1:13:03.300 --> 1:13:04.834
when he tells me to.

1:13:04.834 --> 1:13:07.400
But you know what?
The game in Nome is changing.

1:13:07.400 --> 1:13:10.000
I've worked for years
to get to this point

1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:12.800
and I have a little daughter
to support now.

1:13:12.800 --> 1:13:14.200
I'm not gonna back down
from anyone.

1:13:14.200 --> 1:13:15.133
Screw that.

1:13:15.133 --> 1:13:16.767
Let 's roll.

1:13:16.767 --> 1:13:19.066
They're right next to us.
They're on our line of gold.

1:13:19.066 --> 1:13:20.634
So he jumped
right in front of us.

1:13:20.634 --> 1:13:22.734
- What?
- I don't know
what the [bleep] is going on.

1:13:24.767 --> 1:13:27.367
Oh,
I was having a good day.

1:13:34.667 --> 1:13:35.934
Hey, Janet.

1:13:35.934 --> 1:13:37.867
Hey, Vernon.
Nice to see you.

1:13:37.867 --> 1:13:42.200
Let's see what, uh,
the tolls have to say today.

1:13:42.200 --> 1:13:45.800
And now
another episode
of Social Hour with Vernon.

1:13:55.433 --> 1:13:57.934
Wyatt Earp really,
truly is one of my heroes.

1:13:57.934 --> 1:13:59.834
I mean, he shaped America.

1:13:59.834 --> 1:14:03.533
So, uh, have I been
mining gold since 1804?

1:14:03.533 --> 1:14:05.967
No, I'm not quite that old.

1:14:06.700 --> 1:14:08.133
I mean, do the arithmetic.

1:14:08.133 --> 1:14:10.467
I was born in '46.

1:14:15.634 --> 1:14:16.934
No, I did not.

1:14:16.934 --> 1:14:18.266
I did not ask for one.

1:14:18.266 --> 1:14:20.000
I don't need one.

1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:21.634
I'm old. I got money.

1:14:21.634 --> 1:14:24.033
It's the old people
that's got the frigging money.

1:14:24.033 --> 1:14:26.600
And now I take it as an insult

1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:28.300
when they ask me,
are you a senior?

1:14:28.300 --> 1:14:32.367
Well [bleep] business is it
of yours if I'm a senior?

1:14:32.367 --> 1:14:34.166
And you want to give me
a discount now?

1:14:34.166 --> 1:14:37.166
Where was you
when I was like 20
and I needed the money?

1:14:37.166 --> 1:14:40.600
Now I got enough [bleep] money
to burn a wet stump with

1:14:40.600 --> 1:14:43.800
and you wanna give me
a discount [bleep] you.

1:14:43.800 --> 1:14:45.600
And I mean that from the heart.

1:14:47.033 --> 1:14:48.634
This has been
another episode

1:14:48.634 --> 1:14:50.634
of Social Hour with Vernon.

1:14:50.634 --> 1:14:52.567
What's the damage there, Janet?

1:14:52.567 --> 1:14:53.767
- It's 14.
- Fourteen?

1:14:53.767 --> 1:14:55.600
That's with the senior discount.

1:15:06.700 --> 1:15:09.133
Comes right next to us
first chance he gets.

1:15:09.133 --> 1:15:10.867
Dude, I don't get that.
The ocean is huge.

1:15:10.867 --> 1:15:12.867
What's he doing 50 feet
away from my boat?

1:15:12.867 --> 1:15:14.667
Trying to [bleep] stop me
from making it.

1:15:14.667 --> 1:15:15.834
That's what he's doing.

1:15:15.834 --> 1:15:17.066
That's why we're
gonna go out there.

1:15:17.066 --> 1:15:19.133
We're gonna wrap this is in
right now.

1:15:19.133 --> 1:15:21.500
With the Mistress
and the Christine Rose

1:15:21.500 --> 1:15:24.433
headed for a showdown,
Reaper Nation Chief,

1:15:24.433 --> 1:15:27.367
Kris Kelly heads
for battle stations.

1:15:27.367 --> 1:15:28.867
Nobody steals
anything from me.

1:15:28.867 --> 1:15:30.300
- Yeah.
- We're gonna
go out there

1:15:30.300 --> 1:15:32.700
and we're gonna handle this
like men.

1:15:32.700 --> 1:15:34.433
Okay, Kevin,
let's rock and roll, baby.

1:15:34.433 --> 1:15:36.867
Warp speed [bleep].

1:15:40.400 --> 1:15:45.000
When Shawn goes and tries
to make trouble for me,
I'm not gonna back down.

1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:47.033
I'm determined to join
the heavy weights

1:15:47.033 --> 1:15:48.667
and nothing's gonna stop me.

1:15:50.033 --> 1:15:51.734
Wow. That's crazy.
They are close.

1:15:55.667 --> 1:15:57.867
Give him a little wave
as we pass by.

1:15:57.867 --> 1:15:59.667
- Yeah.
- Hey.

1:15:59.667 --> 1:16:01.934
Well, I'm glad to know
they feel threatened.

1:16:03.300 --> 1:16:05.367
Come on, let's go on the boat
and make some money.

1:16:09.033 --> 1:16:11.300
- Hey, what's up, buddy?
- Hey.

1:16:14.567 --> 1:16:18.133
He's
pissing me off.

1:16:18.133 --> 1:16:20.100
- What's up, dude?
- What's going on,
James?

1:16:20.100 --> 1:16:21.600
They jumped my buoy.

1:16:21.600 --> 1:16:23.533
That's my [bleep] spot.

1:16:23.533 --> 1:16:26.066
This is a bunch of bull

1:16:29.200 --> 1:16:31.667
Let's swing our ass
right into their [bleep] face.

1:16:31.667 --> 1:16:32.900
Protect our area.

1:16:35.300 --> 1:16:36.967
- Let's do it.
- Let's play hardball.

1:16:36.967 --> 1:16:38.266
Spud up.

1:16:38.266 --> 1:16:39.734
Let's rock and roll, baby.

1:16:44.367 --> 1:16:46.634
Stand by!

1:16:46.634 --> 1:16:48.567
Right now we're gonna
move into position

1:16:48.567 --> 1:16:50.166
and defend our hole.

1:16:50.166 --> 1:16:53.233
No one's taking
from me this season.

1:16:53.233 --> 1:16:55.100
We're going to war
it looks like.

1:16:56.266 --> 1:16:58.567
We're gonna take
this fight to them!

1:16:58.567 --> 1:17:00.867
Yeah, baby! Let's move out!

1:17:08.100 --> 1:17:09.567
Keep going!

1:17:14.834 --> 1:17:17.433
We're getting really
close now.

1:17:21.500 --> 1:17:23.000
them.

1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:24.500
They think this is their ocean.

1:17:24.500 --> 1:17:27.400
I don't think so.
I'm here to stay.

1:17:30.100 --> 1:17:31.400
Okay. We're in position!

1:17:34.266 --> 1:17:36.033
And we're locked!

1:17:36.033 --> 1:17:37.567
We're ready to work.

1:17:37.567 --> 1:17:39.033
It's all about the gold.

1:17:40.400 --> 1:17:42.433
Come on, James. Let's do it!

1:18:06.767 --> 1:18:08.300
Look at this right here, man!

1:18:08.300 --> 1:18:09.867
Look at this bucket, baby!

1:18:09.867 --> 1:18:12.033
Yeah, eat it!

1:18:12.033 --> 1:18:14.066
Yeah, it's gonna be
a great game!

1:18:14.066 --> 1:18:15.667
Oh, yeah.

1:18:15.667 --> 1:18:17.834
Pomrenke and his minions think
they can scare us off,

1:18:17.834 --> 1:18:19.133
but we're not backing down.

1:18:19.867 --> 1:18:20.934
We're right in the perfect spot

1:18:20.934 --> 1:18:22.834
and we're gonna load up
on that sweet cobble.

1:18:24.266 --> 1:18:26.800
Reaper Nation is taking over
whether Shawn likes it or not.

1:18:29.333 --> 1:18:31.533
Yeah! Yeah!

1:18:40.834 --> 1:18:43.800
You know, the ground
I'm on right now
is what they're after.

1:18:43.800 --> 1:18:45.834
This is never ending cobble.

1:18:48.400 --> 1:18:50.000
It's absolutely loaded.

1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:54.166
Uh, this is definitely
some of the better gold
I've seen in years.

1:18:56.166 --> 1:19:00.100
So if Shawn wants
to [bleep] with me,
I can handle it.

1:19:00.100 --> 1:19:02.467
You know,
he wants a [bleep] war,
I'll give him one.

1:19:02.467 --> 1:19:03.900
He's gonna [bleep] lose.

1:19:14.200 --> 1:19:17.100
[bleep] they're right
next to our bucket.

1:19:17.100 --> 1:19:20.266
He better not
my machine up
'cause he's breaking the law.

1:19:21.433 --> 1:19:23.800
What's going on right now
is a little battle

1:19:23.800 --> 1:19:26.433
and it's super against the law.

1:19:26.433 --> 1:19:28.634
You know what,
in reality, I was here first

1:19:28.634 --> 1:19:31.634
encroaches my area.

1:19:31.634 --> 1:19:34.834
Back in the day,
I bet you could shoot somebody
over this [bleep].

1:19:38.200 --> 1:19:40.567
Well, here we go.
They're coming closer.

1:19:41.467 --> 1:19:43.500
He's making it dangerous
right now.

1:19:50.900 --> 1:19:52.333
He's getting mad back.

1:19:52.333 --> 1:19:53.967
We are [bleep]

1:20:08.767 --> 1:20:09.834
What the [bleep].

1:20:11.033 --> 1:20:13.600
So they wanna drop material
on the [bleep] barge.

1:20:13.600 --> 1:20:16.400
Those [bleep] pieces of [bleep].

1:20:16.400 --> 1:20:17.700
him.

1:20:20.900 --> 1:20:22.767
What the
is going on?

1:20:22.767 --> 1:20:24.133
I'm pissed.

1:20:24.133 --> 1:20:26.500
Turn on the water hose
and spray them.

1:20:26.500 --> 1:20:28.166
Water blast them, dog.

1:20:28.967 --> 1:20:30.900
Battle station!

1:20:32.133 --> 1:20:34.333
Hey, water blast them!

1:20:34.333 --> 1:20:37.133
They threw rocks on my barge.
Now we're blasting them.

1:20:37.133 --> 1:20:39.100
Another day at the Bering Sea

1:20:39.100 --> 1:20:41.533
and it's all-out war,
and I love it.

1:20:41.533 --> 1:20:42.767
Ready?

1:20:42.767 --> 1:20:43.934
Are you ready?

1:20:43.934 --> 1:20:44.767
Yeah.

1:20:46.533 --> 1:20:49.100
Yeah!

1:20:49.100 --> 1:20:51.233
I'm not a [bleep] coward.

1:20:51.233 --> 1:20:52.433
I'm not gonna be bullied.

1:20:52.433 --> 1:20:54.500
I'm not gonna be pushed around.

1:20:54.500 --> 1:20:56.433
You're not gonna stop me
from making money.

1:20:56.433 --> 1:20:58.033
I gotta make this happen.

1:21:02.066 --> 1:21:03.533
Just a quarter
mile away.

1:21:05.400 --> 1:21:07.667
Piece of
Kris Kelly.

1:21:07.667 --> 1:21:09.266
Stupid little

1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:14.700
Idiots on the Mistress
do it illegal [bleep].

1:21:15.867 --> 1:21:18.634
Kris is about ready
to get his [bleep] ass kicked

1:21:18.634 --> 1:21:21.500
thinking he's
gonna jump on our spot

1:21:21.500 --> 1:21:24.200
and [bleep]
with my guys?

1:21:24.200 --> 1:21:26.200
That
doesn't fly with me.

1:21:27.166 --> 1:21:29.000
The situation has hit
a boiling point.

1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:30.667
I got plans for the summer.

1:21:30.667 --> 1:21:33.533
If this keeps going on,
it's never gonna work.

1:21:33.533 --> 1:21:35.567
I think it's time
for that little punk and I

1:21:35.567 --> 1:21:38.166
have it out face-to-face.

1:21:39.266 --> 1:21:41.533
Hey, guys, uh...

1:21:45.467 --> 1:21:47.100
All right,
sounds good to me.

1:21:54.667 --> 1:21:57.634
waste my
damn [bleep] time

1:21:57.634 --> 1:21:59.333
with this stupid [bleep].

1:22:02.367 --> 1:22:04.400
Kris Kelly and Tattoo Face

1:22:04.400 --> 1:22:06.133
are gonna get a rude awakening

1:22:06.133 --> 1:22:08.767
about who in the
I am.

1:22:12.433 --> 1:22:14.467
Gold game is always competitive,

1:22:14.467 --> 1:22:17.000
but Kris is pushing it
past that.

1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:19.266
It's not a friendly
little competition.

1:22:19.266 --> 1:22:20.934
This is war.

1:22:20.934 --> 1:22:23.000
And I don't plan on losing.

1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:26.266
This [bleep]
laid out!

1:22:29.467 --> 1:22:30.700
Coming up this season

1:22:30.700 --> 1:22:32.300
on Bering Sea Gold.

1:22:32.300 --> 1:22:34.133
I've had it
with Kris Kelly.

1:22:34.133 --> 1:22:36.500
I'm gonna beat his ass.

1:22:36.500 --> 1:22:39.133
I'm ready for the world
to come against me right now.

1:22:39.133 --> 1:22:40.433
I'm not gonna quit.

1:22:44.600 --> 1:22:47.567
- That's huge!
- Woo!
Oh, my gosh.

1:22:47.567 --> 1:22:49.867
- Yeah.
- That's a lot of money
down there.

1:22:49.867 --> 1:22:51.133
Yeah, baby!

1:22:52.066 --> 1:22:53.800
The gold first and safety last.

1:22:54.967 --> 1:22:56.000
Whatever it takes.

1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:57.800
Hand got
completely crushed.

1:22:57.800 --> 1:22:59.300
We're going to the ER.

1:23:00.634 --> 1:23:02.433
There's a storm coming in.

1:23:02.433 --> 1:23:03.934
It is rough.

1:23:05.934 --> 1:23:08.900
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!

1:23:08.900 --> 1:23:11.333
- He flipped over.
- This is all very crazy.

1:23:11.333 --> 1:23:12.767
I'm just as horny
as the next guy.

1:23:12.767 --> 1:23:13.867
Don't get me wrong.

1:23:13.867 --> 1:23:15.700
I'm gonna knock you
the [bleep] out, Kris.

1:23:15.700 --> 1:23:17.600
You stupid [bleep].

1:23:17.600 --> 1:23:20.533
He can take that barge
and ram it right up
his [bleep] ass.

1:23:20.533 --> 1:23:21.900
Get the [bleep] out of my face.

1:23:21.900 --> 1:23:22.900
Yeah, what are you gonna do?

1:23:22.900 --> 1:23:24.567
It's go time!

1:23:24.567 --> 1:23:26.266
Hey, you wanna fight [bleep]?

1:23:26.266 --> 1:23:28.066
Go, go, go, go.
