<i>Rip-Fixes-Sync
by VaVooM</i>

00:37.451 --> 00:39.104
Happy New Year's Eve to you too.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.639
You've been shopping.

00:40.675 --> 00:42.219
I couldn't show up to the
party tonight empty-handed.

00:42.243 --> 00:43.943
Well, I have been shopping too.

00:47.215 --> 00:49.155
- Suits me, no?
- Like a crown to a queen.

00:50.084 --> 00:51.717
Is this what I think it is?

00:51.752 --> 00:53.652
I've been waiting
for you to open it.

00:59.994 --> 01:03.829
Cara, this is,
I'm so proud of you.

01:03.865 --> 01:04.763
It's just a mock-up.

01:04.799 --> 01:07.800
I still have to give
them my final approval.

01:07.835 --> 01:10.703
- What are you waiting for?
- There's still a lot to go over.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.638
The botched heist,
the confession

01:12.673 --> 01:13.784
in chapter 16, the new ending...

01:13.808 --> 01:16.208
- New ending?
- Yeah.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.421
I can't wait to
see what you think.

01:17.445 --> 01:18.544
You can borrow this one

01:18.579 --> 01:20.613
as long as you promise
to give it back.

01:20.648 --> 01:22.047
I don't know,
this could be worth

01:22.083 --> 01:23.616
a lot of money some day.

01:23.651 --> 01:24.683
Ben!

01:24.719 --> 01:26.096
Okay, fine.
Fine, I promise I'll give it back.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.853
That's what I thought.

01:32.059 --> 01:33.759
Great.
Thanks.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.828
- Megan.
- Yes.

01:35.863 --> 01:37.107
Syndra needs new cover
shots by this afternoon.

01:37.131 --> 01:38.664
What? You finished
those already.

01:38.699 --> 01:39.810
Yeah, there's a problem
with the aspect ratio.

01:39.834 --> 01:40.766
Okay, book the cyc wall,

01:40.835 --> 01:42.512
call the rental house
to deliver the lights,

01:42.536 --> 01:44.003
and get IT over
there to make sure

01:44.038 --> 01:45.449
they shoot in the
right format this time.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.084
And do you want green
or white cyc walls?

01:47.108 --> 01:49.508
White, unless they want the model
photoshoped onto the moon.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.810
And send Ariana's
publicist some flowers.

01:51.846 --> 01:53.090
Isn't that talent
relation's job?

01:53.114 --> 01:54.591
Yeah, they're a little
bogged down right now.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.749
- I told them we could help out.
- Oh yeah, we're not?

01:56.784 --> 01:58.984
Please and thank you, Ethan.

01:59.020 --> 02:00.119
A quick question.

02:00.154 --> 02:01.632
When you run out of
ink making a checklist,

02:01.656 --> 02:02.321
do you think the checklist
might be too long?

02:02.356 --> 02:05.524
It just means we're gonna have
a particularly productive afternoon.

02:06.727 --> 02:07.426
You don't have to say yes
to everything, you know.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.627
I don't say yes to everything.

02:09.663 --> 02:12.298
Hi, this is Megan from
Hayden Layne magazine,

02:12.333 --> 02:14.566
we're gonna need to push
print just a teensy little...

02:16.871 --> 02:18.537
I, no, yes, I...

02:21.909 --> 02:23.208
Which one do you like?

02:23.244 --> 02:25.511
No no no.
I want your fresh opinion.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.980
No pressure, it's only
the logo for my company.

02:30.051 --> 02:32.351
Well, this one's my favorite.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.598
- You like that one?
- I mean, they're all nice.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.889
No I'm just kidding,
that's the one I picked too.

02:38.125 --> 02:40.025
I don't know why you
need my opinion anyway.

02:40.061 --> 02:41.238
I didn't found
one of the biggest

02:41.262 --> 02:43.295
snowboarding companies
in the world.

02:43.331 --> 02:45.230
And then quit to
start maybe the smallest

02:45.266 --> 02:46.532
snowboard company in the world?

02:46.567 --> 02:48.600
Maybe but this
company has charm.

02:50.471 --> 02:51.548
- That's good.
- You like that?

02:51.572 --> 02:54.073
I could use that for my
pitch with Porter Mason.

02:54.108 --> 02:56.075
You got your meeting!

02:56.110 --> 02:58.077
- Good news, bad news.
- What?

02:58.112 --> 02:59.323
He is gonna be up at Clara Lake

02:59.347 --> 03:01.246
so he wants to do it
while we're there.

03:01.282 --> 03:02.781
That's not bad news.

03:02.817 --> 03:05.451
Yeah, but this trip is
supposed to be a vacation.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.664
You go back to your graduate
program in a couple of weeks...

03:07.688 --> 03:10.089
Ben, this is a big deal.

03:10.124 --> 03:12.024
And when you land your
big deal with Porter,

03:12.059 --> 03:14.360
it'll just be another
thing to celebrate.

03:15.896 --> 03:18.731
And since you're working,
maybe I can invite Megan.

03:18.766 --> 03:21.000
- Yeah, that's a great idea.
- Yeah?

03:21.035 --> 03:22.701
Right.
Well, I'll ask her tonight.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.937
If anyone could use
a vacation, it's her.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.907
Okay, I'm gonna
get these printed.

03:28.943 --> 03:30.976
- Looks great.
- Thanks.

03:31.012 --> 03:32.652
- I'll see you tonight.
- See you tonight.

03:50.765 --> 03:52.264
Hot off the presses, Syndra.

03:52.299 --> 03:53.999
Two finals for
your cover layout.

03:54.035 --> 03:55.768
You're a life saver.

03:55.803 --> 03:57.948
I know it's New Year's Eve.
Hope it wasn't too much trouble.

03:57.972 --> 03:59.138
Oh no, not at all.

03:59.173 --> 04:01.940
And design's ready to pull
the trigger whenever you are.

04:01.976 --> 04:03.876
How did Mallory
magazine let us steal you?

04:06.080 --> 04:08.647
- Will that be everything?
- Believe so.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.115
You two have fun tonight.

04:10.151 --> 04:12.051
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

04:14.255 --> 04:15.954
Syndra.

04:15.990 --> 04:17.689
What's all of this?

04:17.725 --> 04:20.192
I'm just mocking up some panels
for our travel section.

04:20.226 --> 04:22.594
- We don't have a travel section.
- We do now.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.797
More women are looking
to explore the world,

04:24.832 --> 04:26.698
I think we should
be a part of that.

04:26.734 --> 04:29.902
Was hoping to debut it in February,
but just been so slammed.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.670
We'd love to help.

04:33.674 --> 04:36.909
I know it's not the job
of an operations manager but...

04:36.944 --> 04:38.911
No, it's not that.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.547
You would mock up an entire
section in two weeks,

04:41.582 --> 04:43.515
on top of what
you're already doing?

04:44.618 --> 04:45.684
Sure.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.079
Ethan and I can
handle that, right?

04:48.456 --> 04:51.123
- When do you sleep?
- Sleep is overrated.

04:51.158 --> 04:53.158
We're on this.
Here, give me that.

04:53.194 --> 04:54.194
Happy New Year!

04:58.732 --> 05:01.166
- Told you you always say yes.
- Technically, I said sure.

05:01.202 --> 05:03.869
Two weeks to mock up an entire
section, that's not even...

05:03.938 --> 05:04.670
You minored in
photography, right?

05:04.705 --> 05:06.505
- Yeah.
- Great, you're hired.

05:06.540 --> 05:07.884
Rent whatever camera lenses
and equipment you need.

05:07.908 --> 05:10.876
- What am I taking pictures of?
- Surprise me.

05:10.911 --> 05:14.079
And Amanda!
I was just gonna hunt you down.

05:14.115 --> 05:15.614
Hey, Megan.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.383
- Happy New Year's Eve.
- Happy New Year's Eve to you too.

05:18.419 --> 05:21.520
Have you finished the review
for the Cara Reneau novel?

05:22.690 --> 05:23.956
Almost.

05:23.991 --> 05:24.890
Okay.

05:24.959 --> 05:26.758
When you're finished,
send it over my way.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.772
She's a good friend of mine,
I'm really excited to hear

05:28.796 --> 05:30.162
what you have to say about it.

05:30.197 --> 05:32.031
- Of course.
- Great.

05:35.102 --> 05:37.536
Speak of the devil.
Hi!

05:37.571 --> 05:38.971
I was just gonna call you.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.873
Megan!
Are you free yet?

05:40.908 --> 05:42.808
That's what I was
gonna call you about.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.009
Don't tell me.

05:44.044 --> 05:46.056
I know I said I was gonna
help you pick out a dress but...

05:46.080 --> 05:47.846
They heaped even
more work on you?

05:47.882 --> 05:49.982
I really need to get
a head start on this.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.551
- Meet you at the party?
- Fine.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.464
I guess I'll have to pick
out my dress on my own.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.855
I'm leaning towards
leopard print.

05:57.992 --> 05:59.057
Cara.

05:59.093 --> 06:00.959
I think the style's
coming back in, no?

06:02.630 --> 06:04.796
Okay, okay.
I'm coming right over.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.899
Do not leave the house
wearing anything with spots.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.467
Deal.
I'll see you soon.

06:08.502 --> 06:09.502
See you soon.

06:10.804 --> 06:11.804
Leopard print.

06:15.176 --> 06:18.143
Your apartment looks like
a changing room on Black Friday.

06:18.179 --> 06:19.278
Just being thorough.

06:19.313 --> 06:22.080
All the dresses are great on you,
why all the stress?

06:22.116 --> 06:24.349
I'm not stressed, it's just,

06:24.385 --> 06:26.852
this is my first
New Years with Ben.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.331
New Years is when
people start thinking

06:28.355 --> 06:30.489
about things, like the future...

06:30.524 --> 06:32.457
Yeah well, Ben loves
you whether you're wearing

06:32.493 --> 06:35.227
a Versace dress
or a burlap sack.

06:35.262 --> 06:39.097
- Even a leopard print?
- Don't wear the leopard print.

06:39.756 --> 06:41.233
What's this?

06:42.870 --> 06:45.103
- This is your dress.
- Yes.

06:45.139 --> 06:47.005
- You're a pro.
- That's what I do.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.841
Did you come up
with a plus one yet?

06:49.877 --> 06:51.777
Been a bit busy for that!

06:51.812 --> 06:53.947
- What about Sean?
- Sean?

06:54.381 --> 06:58.850
- What made you think of him?
- I always liked you two together.

06:58.886 --> 07:01.286
Yeah well, you
know, things happen,

07:01.322 --> 07:04.523
phone tag, email tag,
smoke signal tag.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.695
He was a great guy.

07:09.730 --> 07:10.829
What was that?

07:11.565 --> 07:12.931
Nothing.

07:12.967 --> 07:15.267
You look ready to go.

07:16.704 --> 07:18.504
- Your turn.
- Okay.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.039
I got a good one.

07:28.315 --> 07:29.414
Hey!

07:30.084 --> 07:31.250
You look beautiful.

07:31.285 --> 07:34.019
Sorry we're late,
it's all my fault.

07:34.054 --> 07:34.586
Yeah.

07:34.622 --> 07:37.789
Cara had to make sure
every dress she owns still fits.

07:37.825 --> 07:39.424
- So great to see you, Megan.
- You too.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.705
If feels like we never get a
chance to hang out anymore now

07:41.729 --> 07:43.762
- that I'm at Hayden Layne.
- Yes, going well?

07:43.797 --> 07:45.864
Now, they're keeping my plate
full that's for sure.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.933
Well, hey, let me
keep your glass full.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.101
Yeah.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.136
Okay.

07:50.838 --> 07:53.138
Exactly how I wanted
to end the year.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.340
- And what a year it was.
- No kidding.

07:55.376 --> 07:58.210
Last New Years you
swore off dating,

07:58.245 --> 08:00.012
I was an assistant
at Mallory Magazine,

08:00.047 --> 08:02.347
and you were trying to
save your job at Cyan.

08:02.383 --> 08:06.085
- Cheers to failed resolutions.
- Cheers.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.253
For the better I hope.

08:08.289 --> 08:10.589
Sean, I'm so
glad you could make it.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.458
- Hey!
- Hey!

08:13.494 --> 08:15.594
- Hey, Megan!
- Sean.

08:15.629 --> 08:18.031
- It's been...
- Yeah.

08:23.304 --> 08:24.403
So.

08:25.472 --> 08:27.706
Still conquering the world
one magazine at a time?

08:27.741 --> 08:28.840
Yeah.

08:28.876 --> 08:31.076
These operations, they
don't manage themselves.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.077
You're still putting
people back together?

08:32.111 --> 08:36.280
Surgeons, we're basically
carpenters, only less precise.

08:36.317 --> 08:39.183
Less precise?
I let you set my wrist.

08:39.219 --> 08:42.921
- And look at you, full recovery.
- Small miracles.

08:47.261 --> 08:50.796
Hey look, I'm so sorry
about all the phone tag.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.564
And I'm sorry about
the missed emails.

08:52.599 --> 08:56.568
And I'm sorry about that time
I had to cancel, remember,

08:56.603 --> 08:58.003
work was just crazy.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.616
And I'm sorry I had to
cancel the time after that.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.140
Is it fair to say that
we're both sorry then?

09:02.176 --> 09:03.375
More than fair.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.778
Well, then let's get
you a glass of wine.

09:06.814 --> 09:08.748
- Cabernet?
- Yeah.

09:18.292 --> 09:19.157
You're kidding me.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.126
No word of a lie,
there must have been

09:21.161 --> 09:23.795
at least 10 raccoons
on our campsite.

09:23.831 --> 09:24.696
10.

09:24.732 --> 09:25.864
- You counted?
- Oh yeah.

09:25.899 --> 09:26.865
There's the mama,
the papa, the auntie,

09:26.900 --> 09:28.967
the uncle, the twins came.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.403
Yeah, everyone was there.

09:33.307 --> 09:38.243
So this week, after
New Years you busy?

09:40.214 --> 09:41.513
Actually, I'm moving.

09:44.351 --> 09:45.016
Yeah.

09:45.052 --> 09:48.420
Took a job at a new practice.
Less surgery, more patient care.

09:49.923 --> 09:50.923
I'm excited.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.825
That's great.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.060
I'm happy for you.

10:05.038 --> 10:08.707
- You're missing the pretty view.
- No, I'm not.

10:14.581 --> 10:15.680
10.

10:15.716 --> 10:16.782
Nine.

10:16.817 --> 10:17.749
Eight.

10:17.785 --> 10:18.917
Seven.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.085
Six.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.153
Five.

10:21.188 --> 10:22.254
Four.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.121
Three.

10:23.157 --> 10:24.157
Two.

10:24.191 --> 10:25.090
One!

10:25.125 --> 10:27.092
Happy New Year!

10:31.064 --> 10:34.533
- Happy New Year, Ben.
- Happy New Year, Cara.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.380
Yeah.

11:04.031 --> 11:05.031
Thank you.

11:08.135 --> 11:10.902
You ever feel like you finally
have a handle on your life?

11:10.938 --> 11:13.205
No.
What's that like?

11:13.240 --> 11:15.240
Have you given Clara
Lake anymore thought?

11:15.275 --> 11:17.542
Leave on Thursday,
be a long weekend

11:17.578 --> 11:20.278
of food, fun and snowboarding.

11:20.314 --> 11:22.380
Cara, I wish I could...

11:22.416 --> 11:24.749
And plus it'll be like
the one year anniversary

11:24.785 --> 11:26.785
of us all getting stuck
in the chalet together.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.186
It'll be like a reunion.

11:28.222 --> 11:30.088
Trust me, there's
nothing more I'd rather do,

11:30.123 --> 11:32.324
but with work and everything...

11:32.359 --> 11:33.225
I get it.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.327
Besides, it'll be
nice for you and Ben

11:35.362 --> 11:36.428
to get away together.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.330
Sure.
Yeah.

11:38.365 --> 11:41.933
And he'll be working and trying
to sell his new prototype.

11:41.969 --> 11:43.869
Who will I have fondue with?

11:45.539 --> 11:48.273
That Creamy Swiss cheese.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.509
You remember that
Belgian chocolate...

11:50.544 --> 11:53.645
Okay, okay, stop.
Stop.

11:53.680 --> 11:56.915
I'll talk to Syndra, maybe
we can work something out.

11:56.950 --> 11:59.118
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.397
It's just weird
is all I'm saying.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.455
I read the new ending
to Cara's book.

12:03.490 --> 12:04.389
You're overthinking this.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.958
In Cara's old ending,
the two detectives get married

12:06.994 --> 12:08.226
and live happily ever after.

12:08.262 --> 12:11.096
In the new ending, they
go their separate ways.

12:11.131 --> 12:11.796
And?

12:11.832 --> 12:14.633
And I've always kind of felt
like the two detectives

12:14.668 --> 12:16.034
were based on me and Cara.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.569
You don't know that for sure.

12:17.604 --> 12:20.639
Detective Brad Langston,
Ben Livingston, same initials.

12:20.674 --> 12:22.908
Okay.
Hardly conclusive, detective.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.943
You're right.
I know I'm being crazy.

12:24.978 --> 12:26.189
It's just all this
stuff with Charmed

12:26.213 --> 12:28.480
must just kind of
have my head spinning.

12:28.515 --> 12:30.159
You're still bringing
the ring though, right?

12:30.183 --> 12:32.217
Yeah of course.
I'm planning something big.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.496
As soon as I'm done
with Porter I'm gonna...

12:33.520 --> 12:35.453
Drop to a knee
and get a jump start

12:35.489 --> 12:38.323
- on your happily ever after.
- Exactly.

12:38.358 --> 12:41.660
Alright okay, I gotta go.
I'll talk to you later.

12:42.396 --> 12:43.396
- Hey.
- Hi!

12:44.565 --> 12:45.797
You're all packed up?

12:45.832 --> 12:47.277
Yeah, just gonna load
up the board prototypes.

12:47.301 --> 12:48.233
We're good to go.

12:48.302 --> 12:49.913
- Great.
- Have you heard from Megan?

12:49.937 --> 12:52.070
Nah, I haven't heard
from her yet.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.538
Speaking of.

12:55.142 --> 12:55.840
Megan!

12:55.876 --> 12:58.510
Hi! Guess what?
I can come.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.378
Really?
How'd you swing it?

13:00.480 --> 13:01.691
We're launching a
new travel section,

13:01.715 --> 13:05.383
and I sold Syndra on Clara Lake
being our first layout.

13:05.419 --> 13:07.319
- So you still have to work.
- Yeah.

13:07.354 --> 13:08.720
And I can only come for one day.

13:08.755 --> 13:10.689
But, you know, it's
better than nothing.

13:10.724 --> 13:12.357
Hey, I'll take what I can get.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.125
Well, Ethan and
I are on our way.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.760
Great. Well next
time I see you,

13:15.796 --> 13:19.197
it'll be against the
backdrop of powdered slopes.

13:20.601 --> 13:21.866
I can't wait.

13:22.803 --> 13:23.969
Great.

13:29.543 --> 13:32.844
In short, the new technology
makes boards more accessible.

13:32.879 --> 13:34.379
At Charmed Snowboards we believe

13:34.414 --> 13:36.748
there's room on the
mountain for everyone.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.585
Mr. Livingston, in all my
years of hearing pitches,

13:40.621 --> 13:42.420
I've never been so blown away.

13:42.456 --> 13:44.556
I'm sure that's exactly
what Porter's gonna say.

13:44.591 --> 13:45.757
Hey, I'm convinced.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.105
We spent a lot of money
developing this new board.

13:49.129 --> 13:52.063
If Porter doesn't invest,
we're pretty much sunk.

13:52.099 --> 13:54.099
Have you thought of a
name for the new board yet?

13:54.134 --> 13:55.134
Of course.

13:56.637 --> 13:57.637
Hundreds.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.071
You know you only need one.

14:02.309 --> 14:04.676
What time's the pitch?
This afternoon.

14:05.646 --> 14:08.480
Sorry, I don't want this
whole trip to be about work.

14:08.515 --> 14:09.525
I'll just get this over with,

14:09.549 --> 14:11.983
and the rest of the
weekend will be about us.

14:23.630 --> 14:26.097
Can you believe it's
only been a year?

14:26.133 --> 14:27.465
Feels like yesterday.

14:28.735 --> 14:32.504
- You even booked the same chalet?
- It seemed appropriate.

14:37.244 --> 14:39.611
Home sweet home.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.579
And no gift basket.

14:41.615 --> 14:42.514
I guess Charmed Snowboards

14:42.582 --> 14:44.027
doesn't have quite the
same swing as Cyan.

14:44.051 --> 14:47.318
I was only in it
for the gift baskets.

14:47.354 --> 14:50.188
Extra motivation to get
Charmed gift basket worthy.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.858
You even booked the same cabin?
Amazing.

14:53.894 --> 14:57.128
I said the same thing!
I'm so glad you made it.

14:57.164 --> 14:58.129
Me too!

14:58.165 --> 14:59.597
- Good to see you.
- Hi!

14:59.633 --> 15:00.732
Got you loaded up.

15:02.202 --> 15:03.479
Alright, I'm gonna
go unload these bags

15:03.503 --> 15:04.369
and get some test shots.

15:04.471 --> 15:06.204
Right, we got a lot
of ground to cover.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.239
Excuse me.

15:08.542 --> 15:11.042
Hey, Cara, wasn't there
something you forgot to pack?

15:13.814 --> 15:14.913
Right.

15:14.948 --> 15:16.325
Medical tape. Yeah, I was
gonna wrap my ankle

15:16.349 --> 15:17.649
before we hit the slopes.

15:17.684 --> 15:18.516
You hurt your ankle?

15:18.585 --> 15:20.885
Nothing serious,
just wear and tear.

15:20.921 --> 15:24.522
I bet the infirmary has some.
Megan, you were there last year.

15:24.558 --> 15:27.525
How could I forget when Sean
was all roller derby on the slopes.

15:27.561 --> 15:28.793
Do you remember where it is

15:28.829 --> 15:29.360
cause I was just
gonna head there...

15:29.396 --> 15:31.763
No no no.
I'll go get some for you.

15:31.798 --> 15:32.564
Oh no, you don't
have to do that.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.410
No no.
You should rest your ankle.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.145
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, what are friends for?

15:36.169 --> 15:37.970
- Be right back.
- Okay.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.406
You're good.

15:41.441 --> 15:45.376
- Got her to the infirmary, didn't I?
- She really can't say no.

15:55.655 --> 15:58.623
Finally getting your
rematch with this fire pit.

15:58.658 --> 16:02.093
- This time I got a secret weapon.
- Oh yeah, what's that?

16:02.129 --> 16:03.194
A lighter.

16:03.230 --> 16:06.431
A lighter to start a fire?
Revolutionary.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.033
Shoot.

16:09.069 --> 16:09.467
I think I must have left it
in the other coat.

16:09.503 --> 16:11.102
I'll get it.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.204
Don't want you to be
without your secret weapon.

16:45.906 --> 16:46.906
Hello?

16:47.841 --> 16:49.040
Anybody here?

16:49.075 --> 16:51.810
I'm just gonna get
some medical tape.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.879
Sorry, ma'am.
I was just...

16:54.915 --> 16:57.682
Sean, what are you doing here?

16:58.852 --> 17:00.263
I work here.
What are you doing here?

17:00.287 --> 17:03.121
Wait, your new
job's at the resort?

17:10.730 --> 17:12.664
To good wine and better company.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.665
Not so bad yourself.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.602
But you know what?
Something is missing.

17:20.807 --> 17:21.807
I believe,

17:23.710 --> 17:25.844
I believe this is yours.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.682
The pineapple.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.450
It's the most guarded
of all the fruits,

17:32.485 --> 17:34.219
but under the surface,

17:35.088 --> 17:36.554
the sweetest of them all.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.191
Wine charms.

17:40.227 --> 17:42.160
Last year you hated
them and this year

17:42.195 --> 17:44.729
you're naming
companies after them.

17:44.764 --> 17:47.465
That's an acquired taste
I have since acquired.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.069
- To all the charms in our lives.
- Charming.

17:51.404 --> 17:52.682
I have a feeling
this will be a weekend

17:52.706 --> 17:54.739
we'll remember for a long time.

18:05.685 --> 18:06.685
Well.

18:09.222 --> 18:10.154
- Hi!
- Hi.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.689
So good to see you.

18:11.725 --> 18:13.892
I had no idea your
new job was here?

18:13.927 --> 18:15.994
You never mentioned
that during New Years.

18:16.029 --> 18:19.130
Well, the countdown to midnight
sort of interrupted us.

18:19.165 --> 18:20.165
Right.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.936
So how's the new job
going so far?

18:24.971 --> 18:28.273
Well it's only my first week,
but I'm sure it'll be...

18:28.308 --> 18:29.874
Just what the doctor ordered?

18:33.580 --> 18:36.047
Funny us being here
again together, isn't it?

18:36.082 --> 18:38.349
Yeah.
Yeah, it's great.

18:38.385 --> 18:39.450
Work's been crazy.

18:39.486 --> 18:42.287
Feel like I haven't had a
day off since last year.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.222
Oh yeah.
I hear you.

18:44.257 --> 18:46.097
That's partially why I
decided to move up here.

18:46.726 --> 18:49.160
Traded in skyscrapers
for mountains.

18:49.195 --> 18:52.264
- Surgeries for snow rash.
- Yeah.

18:52.732 --> 18:53.865
Excuse me.

18:54.701 --> 18:56.701
Work never stops.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.570
Try not answering
those once in a while.

18:59.606 --> 19:00.772
See how it makes it feel.

19:00.807 --> 19:01.973
Nah, that's not happening.

19:02.008 --> 19:03.619
You're not taking this
away from me this time.

19:03.643 --> 19:04.575
Just don't fracture
your wrist again.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.678
You're planning on
running into me again.

19:06.713 --> 19:07.979
I don't plan on it.

19:08.014 --> 19:10.381
- Appreciate it.
- Yeah.

19:10.417 --> 19:12.350
So, what's up?

19:12.385 --> 19:15.820
I need to get some medical tape.
Cara has a bad ankle and...

19:15.855 --> 19:17.433
Yeah I thought you
weren't gonna be able

19:17.457 --> 19:19.417
to make it up here with
Ben and Cara this weekend?

19:20.493 --> 19:22.593
Wait, they know you work here?

19:23.663 --> 19:25.563
They didn't mention that to me.

19:29.202 --> 19:31.436
I mean, my shift
is just about over,

19:31.471 --> 19:33.604
I mean, we could go
grab some coffee or...

19:33.640 --> 19:36.908
Or you can come to the chalet
and say hello to everyone.

19:37.744 --> 19:39.877
Yeah, that'd be great.

19:39.913 --> 19:42.580
It will be.

19:51.124 --> 19:53.658
I read the new ending
to your book.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.727
Oh yeah, what'd you think?

19:55.762 --> 19:58.963
It's much more open-ended.

19:58.999 --> 20:00.999
Gotta leave something
for the sequel.

20:02.068 --> 20:04.313
You don't think the two detectives
should end up together at the end?

20:04.337 --> 20:05.303
That was my first instinct,

20:05.338 --> 20:08.306
but I don't think
there's any rush, do you?

20:08.341 --> 20:10.075
No.
No I guess not.

20:11.077 --> 20:13.111
Hey ya'll!
Hey!

20:13.146 --> 20:14.512
- Sean!
- Hey, Sean!

20:14.547 --> 20:15.880
I was hoping you'd stop by.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.415
Ye olde chalet.

20:18.151 --> 20:19.050
Wouldn't change a thing.

20:19.085 --> 20:21.252
- Cabernet?
- Please.

20:21.287 --> 20:23.755
You forgot to
mention Sean's new job.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.623
- Did I?
- Yeah.

20:25.658 --> 20:26.758
Thank you.

20:27.761 --> 20:31.029
Hey, Megs, I'm just about ready to...
hi there.

20:31.965 --> 20:34.599
Sean, this is Ethan.
Ethan, this is Sean.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.234
Sean's a doctor
here at the resort.

20:36.269 --> 20:37.509
Well, it's great to meet you,

20:37.537 --> 20:38.748
hope I won't have to
see you too often.

20:38.772 --> 20:40.238
What do you mean?

20:40.273 --> 20:41.851
Just that I don't wanna
end up in the infirmary?

20:41.875 --> 20:43.174
Yeah.

20:43.209 --> 20:44.542
Hope for the best there.

20:48.281 --> 20:50.715
Ethan works with me
at Hayden Layne magazine.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.184
Ethan, doesn't your girlfriend
work at the magazine too?

20:53.219 --> 20:54.919
- Nope, she's a teacher.
- Right.

20:54.954 --> 20:57.889
Yes, Ethan has a girlfriend,
and she's a teacher.

20:58.825 --> 21:00.725
Well, it's fantastic
that we're all

21:00.760 --> 21:02.660
under the same roof
again, but we need

21:02.695 --> 21:04.462
to shoot while we
still have daylight.

21:04.497 --> 21:06.475
Right, just give me five minutes
and I'll get all the gear together.

21:06.499 --> 21:07.499
Okay.

21:08.802 --> 21:09.901
Sean should go with you.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.714
Now that he works here, he
must know some great views.

21:11.738 --> 21:13.604
I've only been
working here three days.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.473
Three days longer than Megan.

21:19.813 --> 21:20.912
Alright.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.480
I may have heard of
a couple lookouts.

21:22.515 --> 21:24.916
- Perfect.
- Perfect.

21:24.951 --> 21:27.753
- Grape?
- Grape.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.055
Grapes.

21:32.659 --> 21:33.891
I'm gonna get some air.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.499
I know what you're doing.

21:41.601 --> 21:43.901
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

21:46.206 --> 21:48.005
Guess what I found
in Ben's pocket?

21:48.041 --> 21:50.741
- I'm afraid to ask.
- A receipt.

21:50.777 --> 21:52.710
Great.
So we know he shops.

21:52.745 --> 21:54.345
To a jewelry store.

21:56.683 --> 21:59.584
You don't think...
Okay, hold on, hold on.

21:59.619 --> 22:00.863
How do you know it's not
for some other piece

22:00.887 --> 22:02.420
of jewelry, maybe a necklace?

22:02.455 --> 22:04.266
I thought that at first
and then I saw the price.

22:04.290 --> 22:05.890
- Too high?
- Too low.

22:05.925 --> 22:08.759
He couldn't buy anything
for that price at that store.

22:08.795 --> 22:10.561
Wait, then he couldn't
have bought a ring.

22:10.597 --> 22:11.462
He couldn't have bought a ring

22:11.531 --> 22:15.500
but it was just enough
to resize a ring.

22:15.535 --> 22:17.802
Add up all the clues,
and it equals one thing.

22:17.837 --> 22:18.870
Proposal.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.341
She's gonna figure it out.

22:23.376 --> 22:25.877
Not this time man.
I'm finally gonna surprise her.

22:25.912 --> 22:28.679
Okay.
Forgive me for being skeptical

22:28.715 --> 22:29.892
but you can barely surprise her

22:29.916 --> 22:33.551
with a cup of coffee in the morning,
let alone a proposal.

22:33.586 --> 22:34.797
I'm paying cash for the flowers.

22:34.821 --> 22:36.587
They're keeping the
dress at the concierge.

22:36.623 --> 22:38.689
- There's a dress?
- There's a dress.

22:38.725 --> 22:39.624
I called up Denise's
wedding planner,

22:39.659 --> 22:41.259
who put me in touch
with her dressmaker,

22:41.294 --> 22:43.995
who gave me the size to
Cara's bridesmaid dress.

22:48.134 --> 22:50.446
Wait, you didn't tell him
you found the receipt, did you?

22:50.470 --> 22:52.637
- No way, not after my birthday.
- Yeah.

22:52.672 --> 22:53.971
You should have acted surprised.

22:54.007 --> 22:57.842
He called to say he was working
late, and I heard a foghorn.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.810
He doesn't even work
anywhere near the water.

22:59.846 --> 23:02.713
Anyone could have
seen that coming.

23:02.749 --> 23:04.149
Okay, I should have
acted surprised.

23:04.184 --> 23:05.316
Yeah.

23:05.351 --> 23:06.428
But this time, I'm
gonna play it cool.

23:06.452 --> 23:08.986
- What about the ring?
- It's my mother's.

23:10.190 --> 23:12.623
Drove 40 miles just
to get it resized,

23:12.659 --> 23:15.293
just to make sure Cara
would never find out.

23:17.030 --> 23:18.841
Yeah.
She's definitely gonna find out.

23:18.865 --> 23:21.966
Not this time man.
I'm telling you she has no idea.

23:26.639 --> 23:28.940
Hey, Megan.
I'm all ready.

23:28.975 --> 23:29.975
Great.

23:30.743 --> 23:33.010
- We better get going, Sean.
- Yeah.

23:35.114 --> 23:36.214
Have fun you guys.

23:40.887 --> 23:42.920
I wasn't sure you were
gonna pull that off.

23:42.956 --> 23:43.854
Less Cupid's arrow

23:43.923 --> 23:45.890
more Cupid throwing
darts at a dart board.

23:47.293 --> 23:49.527
Oh shoot, I need to get
ready to meet up with Porter.

23:49.562 --> 23:51.829
- Great, good luck.
- Thanks.

23:51.898 --> 23:54.599
I've been wanting to walk around.
Re-acclimate.

23:54.634 --> 23:57.134
Okay, I got a surprise
for you after my meeting.

23:58.271 --> 23:59.271
Cool.

24:00.640 --> 24:01.640
Cool.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.575
Cool.

24:04.811 --> 24:05.811
Cool.

24:06.579 --> 24:07.745
Cool.

24:14.387 --> 24:15.698
You sure you don't
want some help?

24:15.722 --> 24:16.921
Nah, thanks, I'm good.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.422
Yeah, he minored in photography.

24:20.893 --> 24:22.026
Careful.

24:22.061 --> 24:23.061
He missed me.

24:24.797 --> 24:27.064
It's so beautiful here.

24:28.034 --> 24:29.812
Some really great views
from the west point,

24:29.836 --> 24:31.669
we just take the chair lift up.

24:31.704 --> 24:33.015
- Just a short walk from there.
- Okay.

24:33.039 --> 24:35.006
You'll get some
really nice shots.

24:35.041 --> 24:36.041
Sounds perfect.

24:37.043 --> 24:38.643
Hey, I forgot my light meter.

24:38.678 --> 24:40.256
You guys take this one up,
I'll be right behind you.

24:40.280 --> 24:41.590
Yeah, it's okay,
I'll be right back.

24:41.614 --> 24:42.980
- Wait.
- Yeah, okay.

24:43.016 --> 24:44.016
Okay.

24:46.452 --> 24:47.285
- This way.
- Yeah.

24:47.320 --> 24:48.552
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

25:03.002 --> 25:06.871
- You go.
- No no no, you go.

25:06.906 --> 25:09.073
- No you go.
- Ladies first.

25:11.744 --> 25:13.544
I forgot what I was gonna say.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.218
So.

25:54.253 --> 25:55.453
This'll work?

25:56.956 --> 25:58.789
This will definitely work.

26:00.827 --> 26:02.827
How'd you even find this place?

26:02.862 --> 26:04.428
Ski patrol told me about it.

26:05.932 --> 26:07.631
But I've never been up here.

26:09.035 --> 26:12.403
Think I might come back,
like every day.

26:14.140 --> 26:15.539
Here, let me see that.

26:17.610 --> 26:18.876
That's great.

26:18.911 --> 26:22.046
Maybe try putting the peak
on the right side of frame.

26:22.081 --> 26:23.882
- Okay.
- Yeah.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.217
Okay, let me see that.

26:26.252 --> 26:27.585
Yeah.

26:27.620 --> 26:29.954
- Are you using a filter?
- What? I...

26:29.989 --> 26:32.523
Because aren't polarizing filters
good for outdoor photography?

26:32.558 --> 26:33.702
Right, but I'm using a
grading filter on this lens.

26:33.726 --> 26:34.392
- I see.
- Yeah.

26:34.427 --> 26:39.463
Okay well, maybe do something
a little bit more like here.

26:39.499 --> 26:42.166
More sky. You know? Okay.

26:42.201 --> 26:44.380
- And what F-stop are you using?
- F-stop I'm using, yeah.

26:44.404 --> 26:46.036
- Hey, Megan.
- Yeah, one minute.

26:46.072 --> 26:47.072
- Aha.
- No it's okay.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.974
Megan, I got it.
More sky.

26:50.009 --> 26:53.043
I got something I'd love
to show you just over here.

26:53.079 --> 26:55.613
Sure.
Ethan, I'll be right back.

26:55.648 --> 26:57.715
- You got it.
- He is fine.

27:06.893 --> 27:09.627
So, what did you want me to see?

27:09.662 --> 27:12.363
Nothing, just an excuse
to get you away from Ethan.

27:12.398 --> 27:15.166
- Excuse me, but I'm working.
- Were you?

27:15.201 --> 27:17.368
Cause it looked to me
like you were hovering.

27:17.403 --> 27:18.903
I was not hovering.

27:18.938 --> 27:23.641
You were kinda doing this thing
where you were like, like,

27:23.676 --> 27:26.410
doing this thing where you were,
kind of looking, but then

27:26.446 --> 27:27.790
you were kind of
peeking and poking.

27:27.814 --> 27:29.013
Sean, I was not...

27:29.048 --> 27:31.715
Could just do this thing?
Could I do this thing?

27:37.423 --> 27:40.959
Okay. Okay. Okay.
I was not hovering.

27:43.062 --> 27:44.195
I mean maybe.

27:46.466 --> 27:49.233
Fine, maybe I was hovering
just a little bit.

27:49.268 --> 27:51.302
Just a little bit.

27:51.337 --> 27:54.038
Hey so, I've got the morning
shift again tomorrow,

27:54.073 --> 27:58.476
but if you got time, late lunch?

28:00.313 --> 28:03.481
I wish I could but I'm driving
back to Seattle tomorrow.

28:05.718 --> 28:06.718
So soon?

28:07.753 --> 28:09.587
Just too bad we
don't have more time.

28:10.990 --> 28:12.156
Yeah, too bad.

28:30.176 --> 28:31.308
What do you think?

28:31.344 --> 28:34.411
Your prototype feels amazing.
It's like floating on air.

28:34.447 --> 28:36.380
That's what I was going for.

28:36.415 --> 28:39.717
- Hot chocolate?
- You read my mind.

28:44.457 --> 28:46.068
You know what, you should
get Porter on a board

28:46.092 --> 28:47.958
because that would
really seal the deal.

28:47.994 --> 28:50.234
You know, the funny thing
about most of these execs is,

28:50.263 --> 28:51.529
they don't even snowboard.

28:51.564 --> 28:53.597
Well, they don't know
what they're missing.

28:53.633 --> 28:54.633
Two, please.

28:59.005 --> 29:00.137
Thanks.

29:01.340 --> 29:02.406
Thank you.

29:04.310 --> 29:07.111
- So...
- So?

29:07.880 --> 29:12.116
- How'd the pitch go with Porter?
- He rescheduled for tomorrow.

29:12.151 --> 29:13.951
What?
Why?

29:13.986 --> 29:15.686
That's fine.
He's a busy guy.

29:15.721 --> 29:17.054
We'll meet up tomorrow.

29:21.694 --> 29:24.128
You mentioned something
about a surprise.

29:24.897 --> 29:26.108
You know what it is, don't you?

29:26.132 --> 29:29.333
- You don't have to pretend.
- No. I don't have a clue.

29:29.368 --> 29:30.646
I was afraid you're
gonna figure it out,

29:30.670 --> 29:34.004
but I knew I had to wait
until we were up here.

29:34.040 --> 29:37.074
This is something,
before I met you,

29:37.109 --> 29:39.310
I never saw myself doing.

29:39.345 --> 29:43.847
But you've inspired me,
and for that I'm forever thankful.

29:50.256 --> 29:52.056
It's a helmet.

29:52.091 --> 29:54.224
- For snowboarding.
- It's not just any helmet.

29:54.260 --> 29:56.760
Look at the back.
It's a hole for a ponytail.

29:56.796 --> 29:58.462
Remember?
It was your idea.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.464
Right!
That's great!

30:00.499 --> 30:02.544
Try it on. It's one of our
company's launch products.

30:02.568 --> 30:04.168
Yeah?

30:04.203 --> 30:05.203
Really?

30:08.441 --> 30:09.573
Fingers crossed.

30:12.845 --> 30:14.745
I've wanted one of
these for years.

30:17.149 --> 30:19.217
- Looks great on you.
- Yeah?

30:20.553 --> 30:21.553
Great!

30:23.589 --> 30:25.389
Thank you.
Really.

30:25.424 --> 30:28.226
- This means a lot.
- Yeah.

30:29.895 --> 30:33.330
I don't know what I missed.
I was sure he was gonna propose.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.033
You can't be right every time.

30:37.136 --> 30:39.481
And how awesome is it that he
used your idea for the helmet.

30:39.505 --> 30:42.172
I know.
That was so sweet.

30:42.208 --> 30:44.041
I probably came off
like a total jerk.

30:44.076 --> 30:45.676
No I'm sure you were fine.

30:49.015 --> 30:50.314
So?

30:50.349 --> 30:52.416
Did you have a good
time with Sean?

30:53.185 --> 30:54.451
The best.

30:54.487 --> 31:00.224
I forgot how charming,
and smart, and funny he is.

31:00.259 --> 31:03.293
- And handsome.
- Don't even remind me.

31:04.363 --> 31:05.807
I would think these
were good things.

31:05.831 --> 31:09.500
Yeah that's good,
but he is here now,

31:09.535 --> 31:11.168
I'm in Seattle.

31:11.203 --> 31:12.436
So when I leave tomorrow,

31:12.471 --> 31:14.638
the carriage turns
back into a pumpkin.

31:17.109 --> 31:18.609
It means a lot to
me that you came,

31:18.644 --> 31:20.778
even if it was for only one day.

31:21.981 --> 31:24.181
I'd sail across
the ocean for you.

31:28.387 --> 31:30.287
I expected her to be
a little more excited.

31:30.322 --> 31:31.822
The helmet was her idea.

31:33.392 --> 31:34.392
You know...

31:35.261 --> 31:37.161
I'm sure she's just
worried about the book.

31:37.196 --> 31:38.974
The book is great,
she has nothing to worry about.

31:38.998 --> 31:40.864
Then why are you
worried about it?

31:40.900 --> 31:43.267
- What?
- The new ending.

31:44.437 --> 31:47.604
- I'm not worried about that.
- Good.

31:47.640 --> 31:48.950
Afraid you were gonna
spend the weekend

31:48.974 --> 31:51.608
trying to play a matchmaker
with fictional characters.

31:51.644 --> 31:53.477
Nope, just you and Megan.

31:56.515 --> 31:58.382
Looks like you had a good time.

31:59.018 --> 32:03.821
She's amazing, and funny,
and smart, and...

32:03.856 --> 32:05.122
Single.

32:05.157 --> 32:07.024
I was gonna say
lives in Seattle.

32:13.199 --> 32:14.376
Hey, we'll shoot
around the Lodge

32:14.400 --> 32:16.100
the rest of the
morning, should be able

32:16.135 --> 32:17.935
to get back to
Seattle by tonight.

32:27.747 --> 32:29.113
Trust me, it's a much more fun

32:29.148 --> 32:31.215
skiing on the slopes
than it is in the trees.

32:31.250 --> 32:33.450
- How does that feel?
- Good.

32:33.486 --> 32:35.030
No more snowboarding
for at least 48 hours.

32:35.054 --> 32:36.054
Okay.

32:36.088 --> 32:39.123
- Make sure she gets some rest.
- Skiing's all right though?

32:39.158 --> 32:40.624
What?
No!

32:40.659 --> 32:43.427
No skiing, no boarding,
no tobogganing, no snow angels.

32:46.365 --> 32:47.798
Okay, thank you.

32:52.538 --> 32:55.239
- Hey there.
- Hey.

32:55.274 --> 32:57.241
Needed more medical
tape for your drive back?

32:57.276 --> 32:59.176
Actually, Ethan
and I got to talking

32:59.211 --> 33:01.145
and we figured
there's more to travel

33:01.180 --> 33:03.647
...than just what you see.
What about the other senses?

33:03.682 --> 33:05.783
I'm sure they're
feeling very neglected.

33:05.818 --> 33:07.618
Ha ha, very funny.

33:07.653 --> 33:10.454
I mean, sure travel
is about sightseeing,

33:10.489 --> 33:12.189
but it's also about
what you taste,

33:12.224 --> 33:14.424
and what you hear,
and what you feel.

33:15.394 --> 33:16.426
Right.

33:16.462 --> 33:18.796
We figured if we're
gonna capture all of that,

33:18.831 --> 33:20.364
we're gonna need more time here.

33:20.399 --> 33:21.665
- You're staying?
- Yeah.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.000
- That's great!
- Yeah.

33:23.035 --> 33:25.769
I mean, more time for you
to explore all that.

33:25.805 --> 33:27.938
So we're still on
for that late lunch?

33:31.577 --> 33:32.577
Yeah.

33:51.897 --> 33:53.597
Look a little bound up there.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.366
Yeah.
Not having much luck.

33:56.402 --> 33:57.668
I could maybe help.

33:59.371 --> 34:00.849
Sometimes ice gets
caked in the bindings,

34:00.873 --> 34:04.775
just gotta knock
it off, and presto!

34:06.278 --> 34:07.177
Thanks so much.

34:07.246 --> 34:09.279
Thought I was going
to wear my board home.

34:09.315 --> 34:10.924
- I'm Lisa.
- I'm Cara.

34:10.949 --> 34:13.617
First time on a snowboard
if you couldn't tell.

34:13.652 --> 34:14.692
Everyone starts somewhere.

34:15.253 --> 34:18.132
I wish I could go somewhere, haven't
even made it down the bunny hill yet.

34:18.157 --> 34:20.690
Well, I could give you
some tips if you want.

34:20.726 --> 34:23.260
You know, I was determined
to do this on my own,

34:23.295 --> 34:26.563
but who am I trying to impress,
I'll take whatever help I can get.

34:27.333 --> 34:29.800
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

34:29.835 --> 34:31.969
- Let's start with those boots.
- Yeah.

34:39.078 --> 34:40.610
How's that feel?

34:40.646 --> 34:44.514
Like Cinderella's step-sister jamming
her foot in the glass slipper.

34:44.550 --> 34:46.949
Great, that means it's perfect.

34:46.985 --> 34:48.150
Great.

34:48.187 --> 34:49.397
Your other ones
were way too big.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.922
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

34:51.956 --> 34:53.257
So Cara, what do you do

34:53.292 --> 34:56.592
besides give snowboard
lessons to strangers?

34:56.629 --> 34:59.329
I'm a writer.
Sort of.

34:59.365 --> 35:01.198
My first book hasn't
been released yet.

35:01.233 --> 35:03.067
You write.
You're a writer.

35:04.270 --> 35:05.780
I think there's more to
it than that, don't you?

35:05.804 --> 35:07.382
Please, you get me
down the bunny slope,

35:07.406 --> 35:09.640
I'm putting snowboarder
on my business card.

35:09.675 --> 35:10.774
Okay, fair enough.

35:11.810 --> 35:15.779
Well, if you don't mind me
asking, why now?

35:15.814 --> 35:16.814
Snowboarding?

35:19.251 --> 35:20.617
High school graduation.

35:21.453 --> 35:24.454
Not mine, my youngest.

35:24.490 --> 35:28.659
Seemed like yesterday I was
teaching her to tie her shoes.

35:28.694 --> 35:30.127
If time's gonna go by so fast,

35:30.162 --> 35:32.162
no sense wasting it
in my comfort zone.

35:32.197 --> 35:34.331
Well, snowboarding doesn't
have to be uncomfortable.

35:34.366 --> 35:35.499
Maybe for you.

35:35.567 --> 35:37.935
If I can careen down a hill
strapped to a plank of wood,

35:37.970 --> 35:39.870
I feel like I can do anything.

35:39.905 --> 35:41.538
Yeah, it's a good
point, actually.

35:41.573 --> 35:43.652
Snowboard materials are actually
getting better and better,

35:43.676 --> 35:45.742
- but I like your attitude.
- Ben!

35:45.778 --> 35:49.279
- What are you doing here?
- I just came in for a little inspiration.

35:49.315 --> 35:51.381
This must be the boyfriend.

35:51.417 --> 35:53.450
Last I checked.
Ben Livingston.

35:53.485 --> 35:55.385
- Hi.
- This is Lisa.

35:55.421 --> 35:56.386
She's up here trying to
learn how to snowboard.

35:56.422 --> 35:57.487
Yeah.

35:57.523 --> 35:58.755
May the mountain be warned.

35:58.791 --> 36:01.425
Cara's been generous enough
to offer some pointers.

36:02.394 --> 36:06.263
You're in pretty good hands.
She's almost as good as I am.

36:06.298 --> 36:08.231
- Really?
- Way better.

36:08.267 --> 36:10.367
It's great you two can
come up here together.

36:10.402 --> 36:12.102
Very romantic.

36:12.137 --> 36:15.839
Yeah, this is actually
the very spot that we met.

36:17.543 --> 36:18.543
A year ago.

36:19.578 --> 36:21.323
My husband's work has
brought him up here for years,

36:21.347 --> 36:23.413
but I was always occupied
with my own business.

36:23.449 --> 36:25.916
- What's your business?
- I'm an event planner.

36:25.951 --> 36:30.354
Birthdays, bat mitzvahs,
weddings too.

36:38.998 --> 36:40.831
Hey, Syndra.

36:40.866 --> 36:43.233
Megan, the sleepless wonder,
how go things on the hill?

36:43.268 --> 36:44.935
Great, really great in fact.

36:44.970 --> 36:48.839
So great that we need a
couple more days here.

36:48.874 --> 36:50.385
I mean, if you need
me back at the office

36:50.409 --> 36:51.808
I'm more than
happy to come back.

36:51.844 --> 36:54.978
No, I think this is fantastic.

36:55.014 --> 36:58.115
You do? You do.
Great, great, yes.

36:58.150 --> 36:59.361
You know, I was thinking
for a full layout,

36:59.385 --> 37:01.051
we're gonna need a
little bit more time...

37:01.086 --> 37:04.087
- Because I was thinking.
- Yes?

37:04.123 --> 37:04.955
We'll have a print section,

37:05.024 --> 37:08.759
but we should have some video
elements for the website as well.

37:08.794 --> 37:10.060
This is true.

37:10.095 --> 37:11.261
If you don't have time...

37:11.296 --> 37:14.097
No no no, we're more
than happy to help.

37:14.133 --> 37:14.931
We can get it done.

37:14.967 --> 37:18.168
- Great, see you when you get back.
- See you then.

37:20.806 --> 37:26.143
- So, what'd she say?
- She said we can stay the weekend.

37:26.178 --> 37:28.245
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.680
And we get to shoot
video for the website.

37:31.717 --> 37:34.851
So on top of doing a full photo
spread, we are now making a video.

37:35.687 --> 37:36.687
Exactly.

37:42.227 --> 37:44.261
I was hoping you'd
forget I had this.

37:44.296 --> 37:47.531
It's gonna be hard to buy when
it's sold out in every bookstore.

37:47.566 --> 37:48.965
Found a typo in the manuscript,

37:49.001 --> 37:51.168
making sure they fixed
it for the print.

37:52.171 --> 37:54.971
I'm driving myself crazy, and the book
hasn't even been released yet.

37:55.007 --> 37:57.274
It's a big step.
Trust me, I understand.

37:57.309 --> 37:59.543
Megan's magazine is
doing the first review.

37:59.578 --> 38:01.211
What if they hate it?

38:01.246 --> 38:04.114
Hey, I've had my
experiences with bad press.

38:04.149 --> 38:05.715
You can't let it get to you.

38:05.751 --> 38:08.752
So you think the
review will be negative?

38:08.787 --> 38:09.920
What? No.

38:09.955 --> 38:11.199
Then what did you
mean by bad press?

38:11.223 --> 38:14.224
- Am I missing something?
- No, I'm sorry.

38:14.259 --> 38:16.726
Just nervous.

38:16.762 --> 38:18.962
You have nothing
to be nervous about.

38:18.997 --> 38:21.565
Soon the rest of the world
is gonna know what I already know.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.567
That you are a wonderful writer.

38:25.204 --> 38:27.971
Speaking of wonderful,
I love this sport coat.

38:28.941 --> 38:29.739
Wouldn't want
Porter Mason to think

38:29.775 --> 38:31.741
he's getting any
less than my best.

38:31.777 --> 38:33.376
Well, it's working on me.

38:34.713 --> 38:35.979
I don't know how you do it.

38:36.014 --> 38:38.281
Starting from scratch
with a new company.

38:38.317 --> 38:40.383
How do you stay so confident?

38:40.419 --> 38:43.186
- Everyone has doubts, Cara.
- Besides you.

38:43.222 --> 38:45.155
You don't think that I wonder

38:45.190 --> 38:47.724
how it might have been
different if I'd stayed at Cyan?

38:47.759 --> 38:49.526
- Do you?
- Well, I don't dwell on it.

38:49.561 --> 38:53.130
But quitting was a
pretty rash decision.

38:54.766 --> 38:56.299
Seems to have worked out.

38:57.102 --> 38:59.836
Maybe you should make
more rash decisions?

39:02.307 --> 39:03.473
Remains to be seen.

39:09.047 --> 39:10.180
Oh my gosh.

39:11.517 --> 39:15.418
- This is so good.
- Ben's secret garnish recipe.

39:15.454 --> 39:17.654
Honed over many winters,
passed on to me,

39:18.357 --> 39:19.422
and now to you.

39:19.458 --> 39:22.259
Well, thank you so much.
Truly honored.

39:23.962 --> 39:29.766
So when you're taking these late
lunches, who mans the infirmary.

39:29.801 --> 39:32.969
They gave me a pager,
but it never goes off.

39:33.005 --> 39:35.438
Less emergencies
up here, I guess.

39:35.474 --> 39:37.274
I thought it was
broken at first.

39:37.309 --> 39:39.442
- A pager?
- Yeah.

39:39.478 --> 39:41.378
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

39:42.848 --> 39:45.448
Hello?
It's for you.

39:45.484 --> 39:47.217
It's the 21st century.

39:48.120 --> 39:50.554
- Come on, a pager?
- You got me.

39:52.324 --> 39:55.992
Hey look, I was thinking.
We had fun last year, right?

39:56.028 --> 39:58.361
It was the highlight of my year.

39:59.264 --> 40:01.331
What if we re-traced our steps.

40:01.366 --> 40:04.201
Trivia-night.
Indoor camping.

40:05.337 --> 40:08.071
No, seriously.
Let's replay our hits.

40:09.641 --> 40:12.008
Yeah.

40:12.044 --> 40:14.244
That's a good idea.

40:18.917 --> 40:22.085
Hello, Nikki!
How's my girl?

40:23.055 --> 40:25.655
Yeah, I'm real excited
to see you too.

40:26.992 --> 40:29.893
You're gonna have a blast,
I'm gonna make sure of it.

40:31.296 --> 40:32.296
Yep.

40:32.331 --> 40:33.430
See you soon.

40:36.602 --> 40:39.903
- That was my niece, Nikki.
- Your niece!

40:39.938 --> 40:41.972
I'm so sorry, I
almost forgot my sister

40:42.007 --> 40:43.940
and her husband are
coming to the resort.

40:43.976 --> 40:46.943
And tomorrow's my day off
so I promised I'd hang with Nikki.

40:46.979 --> 40:49.012
Your poor niece Nikki.

40:49.047 --> 40:51.448
Having to hang out
with her uncle all day.

40:51.483 --> 40:52.716
Yeah, I don't envy her.

40:52.751 --> 40:56.086
Hey, for your information,
I'm the cool uncle.

40:56.121 --> 40:57.787
Hate to meet the other uncles.

41:00.192 --> 41:02.292
It's all good, it's all good,
do your thing.

41:02.327 --> 41:04.527
I mean, I have a very
busy day tomorrow anyways.

41:04.563 --> 41:07.731
Hey, I mean, you could
join us if you'd like?

41:07.766 --> 41:09.210
I'm sure Nikki would
love to meet you.

41:09.234 --> 41:12.636
Really? I mean, I wouldn't want
to infringe on your family time.

41:12.671 --> 41:14.104
Oh no, you wouldn't be.

41:15.374 --> 41:16.573
Well then, okay.

41:23.548 --> 41:26.216
- Hey, Ben.
- Porter.

41:26.251 --> 41:28.818
I'm so sorry it's been so crazy
connecting this weekend.

41:28.854 --> 41:30.453
You're a busy guy, I understand.

41:30.489 --> 41:33.556
When you were with Cyan our
relationship was mutually beneficial.

41:33.592 --> 41:35.558
I would love to
see that continue.

41:35.594 --> 41:37.661
- That makes two of us.
- Great.

41:37.696 --> 41:39.996
- So what have you got for me?
- That's very exciting.

41:42.734 --> 41:43.734
I'm so sorry.

41:44.736 --> 41:45.736
Hello.

41:46.972 --> 41:49.673
No, I said 10,000 units,
not 100,000.

41:51.943 --> 41:54.444
Okay, I'm on my way.
Don't, don't sign anything.

41:54.479 --> 41:57.314
Then stall.
I'm on my way.

41:58.850 --> 42:01.229
Ben, I feel terrible, but is there
any way we can re-schedule?

42:01.253 --> 42:03.787
I actually have something
else planned this weekend.

42:03.822 --> 42:05.155
And I feel terrible.

42:05.190 --> 42:08.358
Next time you'll have my
full attention, I promise.

42:08.393 --> 42:11.094
Okay. Sure.
How's tomorrow?

42:11.129 --> 42:13.196
Tomorrow's no good.
Let's try Sunday.

42:13.231 --> 42:15.266
- Try Sunday.
- Thanks, Ben.

42:15.300 --> 42:18.001
You used to run a big company,
I knew you'd understand.

42:23.308 --> 42:24.308
That's the shot.

42:27.846 --> 42:30.146
Oh you blessed ambrosia.

42:31.183 --> 42:32.949
I told you.

42:32.984 --> 42:36.319
- Ethan, how are we looking?
- Even the camera's drooling.

42:36.355 --> 42:37.754
Oh yeah.

42:37.789 --> 42:40.724
I'd say we can check taste
off our Five Senses of Travel?

42:40.759 --> 42:42.425
Believe so.

42:42.461 --> 42:43.293
Alright.

42:43.328 --> 42:45.406
I'm gonna go upload this card.
Catch up with you later.

42:45.430 --> 42:46.529
Ladies, enjoy.

42:46.565 --> 42:48.365
- Thanks, Ethan.
- Bye.

42:48.400 --> 42:50.166
Thank you so much
for doing this.

42:50.202 --> 42:53.503
This justifies every switch back
driving up through the cascades.

42:53.538 --> 42:57.006
Megan's gonna be making
that trip a lot more often now.

42:57.042 --> 42:58.341
Come on.

43:00.245 --> 43:01.245
What?

43:01.279 --> 43:02.679
It's nothing, really.

43:03.949 --> 43:07.016
You got a thing for
a guy who works here.

43:08.820 --> 43:10.420
- Okay.
- Okay.

43:10.455 --> 43:12.055
I'm just being realistic.

43:12.090 --> 43:13.490
We're having our
fun while I'm here.

43:13.525 --> 43:17.360
But then when I go back to reality,
it'll be just that, reality.

43:18.130 --> 43:19.307
If spending time with someone

43:19.331 --> 43:22.543
feels like a fantasy, that's someone
worth trying to make a reality.

43:22.567 --> 43:25.168
Yeah, but it's a little
more complicated than that.

43:25.203 --> 43:27.937
Sure you aren't the one
making it complicated?

43:31.543 --> 43:33.343
Hey, we just met.

43:33.378 --> 43:35.345
Take everything I say
with a grain of salt.

43:35.380 --> 43:36.312
Grain of salt.

43:36.348 --> 43:39.682
I'm just someone who's
been around the track.

43:39.718 --> 43:41.418
I think you're spot on.

43:41.453 --> 43:43.520
Don't think
you're out of the woods.

43:43.555 --> 43:45.755
- What? Me?
- Yeah, you.

43:45.791 --> 43:48.358
What's the deal with
you and the boyfriend?

43:48.393 --> 43:52.362
There's no deal, I just
misread the situation.

43:52.397 --> 43:54.898
I thought he was gonna
propose, and I was wrong.

43:55.901 --> 43:58.413
Well, from what I hear you're
pretty good at picking up signals.

43:58.437 --> 43:59.969
It's like her super power.

44:00.005 --> 44:01.549
I can't even watch
movies with her anymore,

44:01.573 --> 44:03.573
she always spoils the ending.

44:03.608 --> 44:07.377
Okay, maybe he got cold feet.
I know he's stressed with work.

44:09.281 --> 44:10.281
What?

44:11.049 --> 44:12.816
Your receiver works great.

44:12.851 --> 44:15.285
I think you might need to take
a look at your transmitter.

44:16.855 --> 44:17.855
I don't follow.

44:18.390 --> 44:19.589
You're great at picking up

44:19.624 --> 44:22.592
on everyone else's
signals, but sometimes

44:22.627 --> 44:25.562
we give out signals ourselves
without even knowing it.

44:33.205 --> 44:34.205
You're good.

44:44.182 --> 44:47.684
- Hey, Amanda.
- Hey, Megan, sorry to call so late.

44:47.719 --> 44:49.319
No worries, what's up?

44:49.354 --> 44:53.156
Well, I finished the review
of Cara Reneau's book.

44:53.191 --> 44:55.225
Yes? And?

44:55.260 --> 44:58.428
And it's not one
hundred positive.

45:00.365 --> 45:02.499
I know she's a friend of yours.

45:02.534 --> 45:04.567
No worries, you're
just doing your job.

45:04.603 --> 45:07.470
I'll be sending it to you
before I send it to Syndra.

45:07.506 --> 45:09.105
Please, give it a read.

45:09.140 --> 45:11.374
I will.
Thanks, Amanda.

45:25.457 --> 45:28.358
- How'd it go with Porter?
- Rescheduled again.

45:28.393 --> 45:30.894
Seemed to be an emergency
over a misplaced decimal.

45:30.929 --> 45:32.829
Yikes!
Hope he finds it.

45:34.766 --> 45:37.100
Well, you never know
what tomorrow will bring.

45:37.135 --> 45:38.135
That's true.

45:39.604 --> 45:41.504
And I happen to know

45:41.540 --> 45:44.507
that you are every
bit worth the wait.

45:56.655 --> 45:59.455
- So, how old is she?
- 15.

45:59.491 --> 45:59.889
- What's she like?
- Uncle Sean!

45:59.925 --> 46:01.691
Slick Nick!

46:01.726 --> 46:03.126
Welcome to the mountain top.

46:05.196 --> 46:07.931
- Hello.
- This is my friend, Megan.

46:07.966 --> 46:09.343
Remember from the
chalet mix-up last year?

46:09.367 --> 46:12.235
You're the one who works
at Hayden Layne magazine.

46:12.270 --> 46:14.771
- Yep, that's me.
- That is so cool!

46:14.806 --> 46:17.774
So do you get to meet all the stars
who do photos and interviews?

46:17.809 --> 46:18.441
Sometimes.

46:18.510 --> 46:21.244
Can you tell me about them?
I'd love to have a job like that.

46:21.279 --> 46:22.590
I was thinking I might like
to work in fashion one day,

46:22.614 --> 46:24.781
or maybe be a vet
cause I love animals.

46:24.816 --> 46:26.249
Well, you could do both.

46:26.284 --> 46:28.418
You could have a magazine
about animals.

46:29.754 --> 46:30.920
Don't laugh uncle Sean!

46:30.956 --> 46:33.601
Yeah, uncle Sean, don't laugh.
That would fly off the shelves.

46:33.625 --> 46:34.724
Absolutely.

46:35.660 --> 46:37.493
Who's the most famous star
you've ever met?

46:41.766 --> 46:42.899
You got to meet her?

46:42.934 --> 46:45.268
She came into the
office to shoot a cover.

46:45.303 --> 46:46.135
What's she like?

46:46.171 --> 46:48.871
Let's just say her voice
is even better in person.

46:48.907 --> 46:51.407
- She sang?
- She sang.

46:53.411 --> 46:54.877
Your job sounds amazing.

46:55.947 --> 46:57.480
It can be, yeah.

46:57.515 --> 46:59.560
These bindings are too big,
but we have some smaller ones

46:59.584 --> 47:00.516
in the back you can try.

47:00.552 --> 47:02.685
Don't go anywhere,
I have so many questions.

47:02.721 --> 47:03.853
Staying put.

47:06.791 --> 47:08.091
I don't think she likes you.

47:09.427 --> 47:11.160
- But she's right, you know?
- About what?

47:11.196 --> 47:13.863
- You are really cool.
- Υeah?

47:14.666 --> 47:17.700
Says the guy who literally
puts people back together.

47:17.736 --> 47:20.003
Yeah, but none of my patients
ever sing during surgery.

47:20.038 --> 47:21.337
Well I should hope not.

47:22.641 --> 47:27.777
You know, it's nice to be
reminded you have an amazing job.

47:27.812 --> 47:29.212
I forget that sometimes.

47:29.247 --> 47:31.014
- Pretty stressful?
- It can be.

47:31.049 --> 47:33.216
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I love my job.

47:33.251 --> 47:37.186
I've just taken on a
little too much lately.

47:37.222 --> 47:38.454
And now this book review.

47:38.490 --> 47:41.858
- A book review is stressing you out?
- It's Cara's.

47:41.893 --> 47:44.761
I'm the one who offered
to have the magazine review it.

47:44.796 --> 47:46.929
Never occurred to me
that it could be negative.

47:48.400 --> 47:51.167
- Have you talked to Cara about it?
- No.

47:51.202 --> 47:54.737
I haven't actually read it yet, but
this weekend is supposed to be fun,

47:54.773 --> 47:56.906
I don't want to ruin
it with bad news.

47:58.343 --> 47:59.442
Ready.

47:59.477 --> 48:01.377
- It looks great.
- Let's go!

48:11.456 --> 48:13.790
How cool is it that
one day your book

48:13.825 --> 48:17.026
is going to be on these shelves
amongst all these classics.

48:17.062 --> 48:18.928
I don't know about that.

48:18.963 --> 48:21.064
Well, you don't have to know,
I do.

48:22.767 --> 48:23.900
Everything okay?

48:27.205 --> 48:30.039
Remember how Megan's magazine
is reviewing my book?

48:30.975 --> 48:31.975
Yeah.

48:32.977 --> 48:35.912
Apparently the reviewer
wasn't exactly blown away.

48:37.816 --> 48:40.783
- Did you read the review?
- Not yet.

48:40.819 --> 48:42.779
I overheard Megan talking
to Sean in the pro shop.

48:43.755 --> 48:47.924
Cara, you know I love mysteries.
We bonded over Agatha Christie.

48:47.959 --> 48:51.027
Your book is good,
I promise you.

48:51.730 --> 48:58.868
What if this dream, being a writer,
it's just that, just a dream?

48:58.903 --> 49:00.281
What if this is the
part where I wake up,

49:00.305 --> 49:02.672
and realize how silly
this dream has been?

49:10.315 --> 49:11.481
The Great Gatsby.

49:12.717 --> 49:15.518
Chicago Tribune called
it obviously unimportant.

49:15.553 --> 49:17.153
It's so unimportant
it's now considered

49:17.188 --> 49:19.322
one of the greatest
novels of all time.

49:20.558 --> 49:22.859
On the Road, Jack Kerouac.

49:22.894 --> 49:26.596
Truman Capote panned it,
called it typing not writing.

49:26.631 --> 49:28.843
Didn't stop it from inspiring
a bunch of dumb teenage boys

49:28.867 --> 49:32.034
to drive across the country,
including yours truly.

49:32.771 --> 49:35.104
Moby Dick, Brave New
World, Three Musketeers,

49:35.140 --> 49:37.907
there isn't a book on these shelves
that hasn't been criticized.

49:38.843 --> 49:43.212
If it's in your heart,
no one can touch it.

49:43.248 --> 49:44.248
Okay?

49:46.718 --> 49:47.718
Okay.

49:51.089 --> 49:51.921
Okay.

49:51.956 --> 49:54.724
So, if any reason you can't find us,
meet us at the information desk

49:54.759 --> 49:55.525
- and we'll...
- Got it.

49:55.560 --> 49:57.827
- See you at the top!
- Come find you.

49:59.330 --> 50:00.163
It was a good try.

50:00.198 --> 50:02.999
- My sister's gonna kill me.
- No, she is not.

50:03.034 --> 50:06.469
You just need to relax.
Isn't that why you moved here?

50:06.504 --> 50:07.570
To relax?

50:07.605 --> 50:10.740
You mean why I traded in
surgeries for snow rash?

50:12.110 --> 50:16.779
I had gotten into
I guess you'd call it a funk.

50:16.815 --> 50:18.714
And I thought back to
when was the last time

50:18.750 --> 50:21.617
I was truly happy,
and it was up here.

50:24.889 --> 50:27.256
You know,
we're not all like you.

50:28.793 --> 50:31.494
Handle everything
and still ask for more.

50:31.529 --> 50:33.796
Yeah, well, being so
much faster than you

50:33.832 --> 50:35.898
just gets me a
lot of extra time.

50:35.934 --> 50:39.235
- So much faster?
- So much faster.

50:39.270 --> 50:41.571
If you can't find me,
I'll be at the information desk.

50:41.606 --> 50:45.842
- Okay, I'll see you there.
- See you there!

50:50.849 --> 50:53.816
In the human body,
what is the hallux?

50:55.119 --> 50:55.918
Hallux?

50:55.954 --> 50:57.453
A, throat.

50:57.488 --> 50:58.488
B, hip.

50:58.523 --> 51:00.022
C, big toe.

51:00.058 --> 51:01.390
D, elbow.

51:02.393 --> 51:04.171
You must know this one Uncle
Sean, you're a doctor.

51:04.195 --> 51:05.995
We're one point behind the lead.

51:06.865 --> 51:09.165
I would go with elbow,
that's my guess.

51:09.200 --> 51:11.033
- Is it elbow?
- Big toe.

51:11.069 --> 51:12.034
Really?

51:12.070 --> 51:14.237
Big toe?
You sure?

51:18.476 --> 51:19.476
Tied for the lead!

51:20.311 --> 51:22.478
- That was intense.
- Tell me about it.

51:22.513 --> 51:24.213
I got a cramp in my hallux.

51:28.052 --> 51:29.318
Alright.

51:29.354 --> 51:32.154
It all comes down to this.

51:32.190 --> 51:34.490
I know this one.
It's D.

51:34.525 --> 51:36.826
Now if you're
sure, I'll trust you.

51:36.861 --> 51:39.161
But if you're not, I need
to know like right now.

51:39.197 --> 51:41.931
I'm sure uncle Sean.
It's D, Stitches.

51:43.101 --> 51:45.334
- One hundred percent?
- Yes, trust me!

51:46.404 --> 51:47.603
Come on, press D.

51:48.573 --> 51:50.251
But are you one hundred
percent sure though?

51:50.275 --> 51:51.240
Come on, press D!

51:51.276 --> 51:53.442
- Press D.
- Okay, okay.

51:55.113 --> 51:56.178
Yes!

51:56.214 --> 51:58.014
The word dynasty gets
thrown around a lot.

51:58.049 --> 51:58.915
Yes, it does.

51:58.950 --> 52:00.227
But at this point,
it's the only word

52:00.251 --> 52:02.184
for the back to back
trivia champions.

52:02.220 --> 52:03.286
Yes.

52:03.321 --> 52:05.521
And we couldn't have
done it without Nikki.

52:05.556 --> 52:07.857
Slick Nick, coming in
with the music knowledge.

52:07.892 --> 52:09.025
Lucky I was here.

52:09.060 --> 52:09.959
How have you never
heard of Sean Mendes?

52:09.994 --> 52:11.994
Yeah I thought you
were the cool uncle?

52:12.030 --> 52:14.230
I've heard of Sean Mendes,
but it's just that song,

52:14.265 --> 52:16.999
it had like a little thing
that I wasn't sure.

52:17.035 --> 52:19.635
Well, it was just a pleasure
meeting you, Nikki.

52:19.671 --> 52:21.504
It was great meeting
you, too, Megan.

52:25.476 --> 52:27.376
I had fun with you too,
uncle Sean.

52:30.581 --> 52:32.048
You were right about her.

52:33.818 --> 52:35.029
Your parents are
waiting outside.

52:35.053 --> 52:37.698
You'd better get going
before your mother thinks I lost you.

52:37.722 --> 52:40.589
- Okay, good night.
- Good night.

52:43.094 --> 52:46.195
- What did she mean by that?
- What did she mean by what?

52:46.230 --> 52:49.065
What she said.
You were right about her.

52:50.268 --> 52:52.046
I told her that you were
an excellent trivia partner.

52:52.070 --> 52:54.571
Yes of course.
Of course.

53:02.413 --> 53:04.091
I thought you were just
taking video today.

53:04.115 --> 53:05.281
These are amazing.

53:05.316 --> 53:06.649
Just a man with a camera.

53:06.684 --> 53:10.120
- No, you really got something here.
- Thanks.

53:14.592 --> 53:15.825
What are these?

53:15.860 --> 53:18.361
I snapped a few candids
on the lookout.

53:20.465 --> 53:24.367
- I didn't even notice.
- You were distracted.

53:24.402 --> 53:25.402
I, I...

53:31.209 --> 53:34.143
For our five senses of travel,

53:34.178 --> 53:36.445
I was thinking about
how we can communicate

53:36.481 --> 53:38.381
feeling through a photograph.

53:39.517 --> 53:41.784
What if it doesn't have
to be so literal?

53:41.819 --> 53:45.621
What if we talk
about how traveling,

53:45.656 --> 53:50.760
getting outside of ourselves
can, well, can touch our hearts?

53:53.798 --> 53:55.331
That's really good copy.

53:56.167 --> 53:59.101
Anyways, these photos
of you and Sean,

54:00.038 --> 54:02.405
I thought that feeling
really came across.

54:03.341 --> 54:04.507
I'm sending you the files.

54:04.542 --> 54:07.743
You know.
So, you can pick your favorites.

54:08.646 --> 54:11.081
- Good work today, Ethan.
- Thanks.

54:13.718 --> 54:14.850
Ethan.

54:15.853 --> 54:16.886
Yeah?

54:16.921 --> 54:19.422
I think we have everything
that we need.

54:19.457 --> 54:22.825
You can go home tomorrow.
I'll catch a ride with Cara and Ben.

54:22.860 --> 54:23.860
Sure thing.

54:25.763 --> 54:26.896
Thanks.

54:26.931 --> 54:28.064
Good night, Ethan.

54:33.471 --> 54:34.471
Hey there.

54:36.340 --> 54:37.506
Hey.

54:37.608 --> 54:39.887
- Have fun with Sean's niece?
- It's like trying to keep up

54:39.911 --> 54:41.110
with a hummingbird.

54:42.647 --> 54:45.147
But yeah, she was,
she was great.

54:46.350 --> 54:48.651
Do you know how to make
weekends last forever?

54:49.687 --> 54:50.786
I can ask around.

54:57.595 --> 54:59.662
Is this all Sean
and I will ever be?

55:00.465 --> 55:03.866
Great weekends once a year
if I can fit it into work.

55:03.901 --> 55:05.367
You know they made these things

55:05.403 --> 55:07.448
called telephones now? They'd
let you talk to somebody,

55:07.472 --> 55:09.171
even if you're not
in the same city.

55:10.041 --> 55:13.142
I've seen that movie.
I know how it ends.

55:15.746 --> 55:20.316
But two great weekends is more
than some people get, right?

55:21.686 --> 55:23.686
If anybody deserves
more, it's you.

55:24.589 --> 55:27.056
What about you?
Everything okay?

55:27.091 --> 55:29.658
What? Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.

55:29.694 --> 55:33.629
Cara Reneau, I know that look,
that's not your 'I'm fine' look.

55:38.636 --> 55:41.737
I overheard you and Sean
talking in the pro shop,

55:41.772 --> 55:43.305
about the review.

55:43.341 --> 55:47.476
- Cara, I'm so...
- No no no no. Don't worry.

55:47.512 --> 55:49.211
You didn't want to
ruin my vacation.

55:49.247 --> 55:50.646
You were just being
a good friend.

55:50.681 --> 55:53.449
I'll call Syndra.
I'll ask her not to print it.

55:53.484 --> 55:56.218
You know that I would never
exploit our friendship like that.

55:57.288 --> 55:59.522
Plus, all press
is good press, right?

56:14.705 --> 56:16.272
- Morning.
- Hey.

56:16.307 --> 56:17.973
Hope you had some sleep.

56:18.009 --> 56:20.142
Yeah, a few winks
here and there.

56:20.178 --> 56:21.911
Have you heard from Porter yet?

56:23.981 --> 56:26.016
No. Not yet.

56:29.787 --> 56:32.188
- Looking good.
- I know right?

56:33.791 --> 56:36.525
Thank you, for what you said
yesterday in the library.

56:36.561 --> 56:40.262
- It really meant a lot to me.
- I meant every word.

56:46.337 --> 56:48.003
Can I take out your board?

56:48.806 --> 56:49.872
Yeah, of course.

56:50.841 --> 56:51.841
Great.

56:57.181 --> 56:59.181
- Good morning, coach.
- Morning.

56:59.217 --> 57:00.482
What you got there?

57:00.518 --> 57:02.162
Remember how you said
your board felt heavy?

57:02.186 --> 57:06.021
Well, I think I found
your secret weapon.

57:06.057 --> 57:08.324
Okay.
I'm all ears.

57:08.359 --> 57:09.570
Just as soon as I get
my helmet on.

57:09.594 --> 57:12.494
Want to make sure
this one actually fits.

57:12.530 --> 57:15.731
- Ponytail's so uncomfortable, right?
- Here.

57:15.766 --> 57:17.633
Try mine.
My boyfriend makes one

57:17.668 --> 57:19.635
with room for a ponytail
in the back.

57:19.670 --> 57:21.770
Great.
Thanks.

57:21.806 --> 57:22.905
Cool.

57:28.112 --> 57:29.979
- Great!
- Right?

57:30.014 --> 57:31.614
Why didn't anyone
think of this sooner?

57:32.516 --> 57:34.551
Okay. Ready.

57:37.989 --> 57:38.821
Yeah.

57:38.889 --> 57:39.967
Just make sure they're
nice and tight.

57:39.991 --> 57:41.423
Alright, let's do this.

57:45.529 --> 57:46.395
Got this?

57:46.430 --> 57:47.730
- Got it.
- Nice.

57:49.233 --> 57:51.100
- Okay.
- Yeah?

57:51.135 --> 57:54.670
This board does feel nice.
So much lighter and easier to balance.

57:54.705 --> 57:56.705
- Good.
- Ben built this?

57:56.741 --> 57:58.907
Yeah.
His own special recipe.

57:58.943 --> 58:00.175
Talk about a keeper.

58:01.412 --> 58:03.490
Alright, we're gonna start
off nice and easy, okay?

58:03.514 --> 58:06.115
- Trusting you here.
- Absolutely, here we go.

58:07.417 --> 58:09.685
Going down the hill.
You got this.

58:09.720 --> 58:10.753
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:11.656 --> 58:12.656
There we go.

58:12.690 --> 58:13.690
Hey, Lisa.

58:14.759 --> 58:17.293
Cara, don't you, no, Cara!

58:18.396 --> 58:21.930
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah!

58:21.966 --> 58:24.367
Nice.
Atta girl!

58:26.470 --> 58:29.139
You did it!
Yeah, nice!

58:30.808 --> 58:32.007
Did I just shred?

58:34.145 --> 58:36.378
My husband gave me
a Spark snowboard,

58:36.414 --> 58:39.114
his company makes them,
but I gotta get one of these.

58:39.150 --> 58:40.983
If a gal like me can ride it...

58:41.719 --> 58:45.054
Everyone starts somewhere.

58:49.694 --> 58:51.527
Everyone starts somewhere.

58:52.697 --> 58:53.796
What?

58:53.831 --> 58:56.298
Every snowboarder,
from working moms

58:56.334 --> 58:59.902
to gold medalists,
everyone starts somewhere.

58:59.937 --> 59:01.036
Yeah.

59:01.072 --> 59:04.173
Well, you've been looking
for a hook to keep the prices low.

59:04.208 --> 59:06.787
But Porter's not gonna invest if I can't
convince him it's profitable.

59:06.811 --> 59:07.710
Yeah but that's just the thing,

59:07.812 --> 59:10.012
what does every
snowboarder have in common?

59:11.315 --> 59:13.148
They all start out as beginners.

59:15.486 --> 59:17.152
You could be onto something.

59:18.356 --> 59:19.788
Still a few things to iron out.

59:19.824 --> 59:23.659
I want to keep the cool factor,
but everyone starts somewhere.

59:23.694 --> 59:25.661
Now you just need to
come up with a name?

59:25.696 --> 59:27.074
Right, I've been
leaning towards Thunder.

59:27.098 --> 59:30.599
Thunder sounds like a racehorse.
I don't know.

59:30.634 --> 59:33.669
Your board's sleek, and light.

59:34.905 --> 59:36.305
The Feather.

59:36.340 --> 59:37.673
Feather's kind of delicate.

59:37.708 --> 59:40.109
This board is strong,
it's dependable.

59:41.946 --> 59:45.581
I'll think of something.
Thank you, thank you for this.

59:51.422 --> 59:52.921
You know, we said
that we were going

59:52.957 --> 59:59.228
to retrace our steps, and indoor
camping was a significant step.

59:59.263 --> 01:00:00.696
It was the last step.

01:00:01.699 --> 01:00:04.233
- You know what they say.
- What's that?

01:00:04.268 --> 01:00:07.202
All great things
must come to an end.

01:00:07.238 --> 01:00:09.471
I wish it wasn't so.

01:00:14.745 --> 01:00:15.944
Sean?

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:16.980
Yeah?

01:00:17.615 --> 01:00:19.314
Do you ever think about it?

01:00:20.418 --> 01:00:22.384
Think about what?

01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:25.654
Why this, whatever this is,
didn't work in Seattle?

01:00:30.628 --> 01:00:33.529
You were busy, I was busy.

01:00:34.765 --> 01:00:35.831
We're busy people.

01:00:37.301 --> 01:00:39.101
I guess I don't see that changing.

01:00:40.104 --> 01:00:42.704
I mean, I don't know,
I've worked so hard

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:45.841
to get where I am, and I'm
scared that if I don't,

01:00:45.876 --> 01:00:47.342
it's all gonna go away.

01:00:51.015 --> 01:00:52.448
It also made it easier.

01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:55.017
What do you mean?

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:59.154
We had such a special time
when we were here,

01:00:59.190 --> 01:01:02.624
that maybe we thought
if we went to Seattle,

01:01:04.862 --> 01:01:07.896
and the magic wasn't
there that maybe,

01:01:10.901 --> 01:01:15.471
maybe being busy was just
an excuse not to take the risk.

01:01:17.775 --> 01:01:19.641
Or maybe we just work too much.

01:01:21.245 --> 01:01:23.579
Yeah.
Maybe.

01:01:23.614 --> 01:01:25.013
It's not done.

01:01:25.049 --> 01:01:26.615
I like mine medium rare.

01:01:27.485 --> 01:01:30.252
Well, I like mine well done.

01:01:36.327 --> 01:01:40.462
You can breathe a little
deeper up here?

01:01:40.498 --> 01:01:42.598
Yeah, that's the good stuff.

01:01:46.537 --> 01:01:49.838
- Do you remember Camp Snow?
- Sure.

01:01:49.874 --> 01:01:52.741
They help underprivileged kids
go snowboarding.

01:01:52.776 --> 01:01:55.677
Yeah.
The smiles on those kids' faces,

01:01:55.713 --> 01:01:58.113
doing something they thought
they'd never be able to do.

01:01:59.583 --> 01:02:01.517
You've always been
very generous.

01:02:01.552 --> 01:02:02.451
Yeah but those kids,
they go home

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:05.020
with black diamonds
shining in their eyes.

01:02:06.123 --> 01:02:08.524
Then they find out what
the equipment costs.

01:02:08.559 --> 01:02:11.293
Don't ever feel like
you haven't given enough.

01:02:11.328 --> 01:02:13.362
But with my new
polymer, those same kids,

01:02:13.397 --> 01:02:16.098
they could finally afford
a board of their own.

01:02:18.402 --> 01:02:20.469
That's why this is
so important to me.

01:02:22.873 --> 01:02:25.040
There's room on the
mountain for everyone.

01:02:25.976 --> 01:02:28.277
That's more than just
a slogan to me, Cara.

01:02:29.213 --> 01:02:31.613
Charmed is more than
just a business to me,

01:02:32.650 --> 01:02:34.883
the way your novel is more
than just a book to you.

01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:37.452
Yeah.

01:02:37.488 --> 01:02:38.720
I live every detail,

01:02:38.756 --> 01:02:42.291
the way you live
every word, right?

01:02:45.496 --> 01:02:47.162
So why did you change
the ending?

01:02:49.033 --> 01:02:50.933
Because my publisher
asked me to.

01:02:53.804 --> 01:02:56.705
Your publisher asked you
to take out the proposal?

01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:58.140
Well, not exactly.

01:02:58.175 --> 01:02:59.586
I mean, they asked for
something more open-ended,

01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:04.212
so that was my idea.
What's this about?

01:03:04.248 --> 01:03:06.548
Sorry.
Forget I said anything.

01:03:06.584 --> 01:03:08.824
Wait, is there something
you don't like about the ending?

01:03:11.822 --> 01:03:15.023
Am I crazy to think that those
characters are based on us?

01:03:15.993 --> 01:03:17.926
Wait, is that why you didn't...?

01:03:20.264 --> 01:03:21.930
No, Ben, they're just,

01:03:22.766 --> 01:03:24.733
they're just characters,
they're not based on us.

01:03:24.768 --> 01:03:26.001
Not at all?

01:03:26.036 --> 01:03:29.938
I mean, sure every writer draws
from their life somewhat but

01:03:29.974 --> 01:03:32.140
I don't remember us
foiling a jewel heist.

01:03:32.176 --> 01:03:35.510
So you changing the ending,
it was just a business decision?

01:03:35.546 --> 01:03:37.346
Yeah, what else would it be?

01:03:38.482 --> 01:03:41.003
I'm sorry, Cara.
It just feels like more than that.

01:03:41.752 --> 01:03:44.252
What, so you think I
broke up the detectives

01:03:44.288 --> 01:03:45.532
because I secretly
don't love you?

01:03:45.556 --> 01:03:48.435
- No, that's not what I'm saying.
- Then what are you saying, Ben?

01:03:48.459 --> 01:03:51.093
What I'm saying is,
is it possible, maybe,

01:03:51.128 --> 01:03:53.528
that there's something in
that ending, some question

01:03:53.564 --> 01:03:55.163
you're trying to
answer for yourself?

01:03:55.199 --> 01:03:56.732
Everyone gets
cold feet sometimes,

01:03:56.767 --> 01:03:59.267
but I don't think you can
blame my book for that.

01:03:59.303 --> 01:04:00.502
What do you mean cold feet?

01:04:00.537 --> 01:04:03.472
You know, like if you were planning
on asking me something important,

01:04:03.507 --> 01:04:04.840
and then decided not to.

01:04:05.876 --> 01:04:08.110
Wait.
You know about the...

01:04:08.145 --> 01:04:09.211
...how?

01:04:09.246 --> 01:04:12.881
I found the receipt in your jacket,
from the jewelry store.

01:04:13.851 --> 01:04:16.051
There is no surprising you,
is there?

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:18.120
I don't know why I even try.

01:04:18.155 --> 01:04:21.289
So it's not a surprise.
Is it really that big of a deal?

01:04:21.325 --> 01:04:23.291
Yeah.
Actually, this is a big deal.

01:04:23.327 --> 01:04:25.160
This weekend has been
a big deal for me.

01:04:30.267 --> 01:04:33.669
I can't believe I fought with Cara
over fictional characters.

01:04:33.704 --> 01:04:34.781
I used to fight with my sister

01:04:34.805 --> 01:04:38.173
over who got to be T-Rex
when we played dinosaurs.

01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:39.675
Am I losing my mind?

01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:40.842
Nah.

01:04:41.679 --> 01:04:43.845
You gotta have a mind
to lose first.

01:04:46.083 --> 01:04:48.183
You know,
you've always been my idol?

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:50.819
- Come on.
- I mean it.

01:04:50.854 --> 01:04:52.421
You're like an action star,

01:04:52.456 --> 01:04:54.523
always diving into
the great unknown.

01:04:55.526 --> 01:04:58.361
But this Ben, the one who overthinks,
this isn't you.

01:04:59.063 --> 01:05:00.862
I mean, the Ben I know,

01:05:00.898 --> 01:05:04.466
an investor reschedules on him twice,
he takes his business elsewhere.

01:05:06.203 --> 01:05:08.070
And to think
you were always my hero.

01:05:08.105 --> 01:05:10.605
Guy, you don't have to
say it just cause I said it.

01:05:10.641 --> 01:05:13.842
High stress job,
people putting their lives in your hands,

01:05:14.645 --> 01:05:17.647
and you never let it get it to you.
Always a smile.

01:05:20.017 --> 01:05:21.917
You ever seen a duck swimming?

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:24.886
Yeah?

01:05:24.922 --> 01:05:27.155
Above the water, calm.

01:05:28.492 --> 01:05:29.891
Below the water,

01:05:30.694 --> 01:05:34.262
those legs are just
churning up a storm.

01:05:35.332 --> 01:05:36.765
Okay?

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:41.603
What I'm trying to say is,
any peace you thought I had, I didn't.

01:05:43.707 --> 01:05:46.074
I just kept doing
what I had to do anyway.

01:05:55.786 --> 01:05:58.865
If the detective steals the crown
jewels, is he gonna look at me sideways

01:05:58.889 --> 01:06:00.129
for buying a ticket to England?

01:06:00.157 --> 01:06:02.902
Well, he thought the characters
were based on the two of you,

01:06:02.926 --> 01:06:04.092
and then you broke them up.

01:06:04.128 --> 01:06:05.338
Of course he's gonna
wonder what that means.

01:06:05.362 --> 01:06:08.163
But that's the thing,
the characters aren't based on us.

01:06:10.634 --> 01:06:11.967
What?

01:06:12.002 --> 01:06:14.569
Detective Brad Langston.

01:06:14.605 --> 01:06:15.605
Yeah.

01:06:16.774 --> 01:06:19.474
Brad Langston,
Ben Livingston.

01:06:20.978 --> 01:06:22.644
Same initials.

01:06:23.947 --> 01:06:26.915
Now I know why I'm always
mistaken for Cal Ripken.

01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:29.985
It's not just the initials, Cara.
It's, it's...

01:06:30.053 --> 01:06:33.755
I mean sure Brad Langston is handsome,
and caring, and generous

01:06:33.791 --> 01:06:37.192
but Brad like burritos,
Ben likes bratwursts.

01:06:43.033 --> 01:06:44.033
He's based on Ben.

01:06:47.938 --> 01:06:49.504
How did I not see that?

01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:51.506
Honestly girl,
you're the only one.

01:06:52.776 --> 01:06:54.876
But I want Ben to propose,

01:06:54.912 --> 01:06:57.846
I wouldn't have changed
the ending to tell him not to.

01:06:59.516 --> 01:07:01.183
Connection's scary.

01:07:01.218 --> 01:07:03.351
Sometimes in ways
we don't even notice

01:07:03.387 --> 01:07:06.188
we sabotage things
to avoid the risk

01:07:06.223 --> 01:07:07.522
of being hurt.

01:07:09.426 --> 01:07:12.527
- How could I be so stupid?
- No no no.

01:07:12.563 --> 01:07:16.531
You're not stupid, you're the smartest,
most talented person I know.

01:07:17.634 --> 01:07:20.101
Talented enough to write a novel
that critics hate.

01:07:20.137 --> 01:07:22.804
It was one critic,
and she didn't hate it.

01:07:24.007 --> 01:07:26.975
- You read the review?
- I did, this morning.

01:07:27.010 --> 01:07:29.578
And you should too.

01:07:29.613 --> 01:07:32.214
I don't think I'm up
for that right now.

01:07:39.223 --> 01:07:40.223
Read it.

01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:44.726
I'm gonna hit the slopes.

01:07:45.963 --> 01:07:49.097
One last time, before I have
to go back to reality.

01:08:13.924 --> 01:08:16.625
Cara Reneau's novel,
The Girl Who Knew Too Much,

01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:18.225
is one of the most
promising debuts

01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:20.895
in the mystery genre
for quite some time,

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:24.366
a fact which makes its late
missteps all the more confounding.

01:08:25.636 --> 01:08:29.004
Tautly written, rife with
subterfuge and reveals,

01:08:29.038 --> 01:08:31.773
its heart is what makes
it truly appealing.

01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:35.443
It's a story about how sometimes

01:08:35.479 --> 01:08:38.113
to solve a mystery we
must stop looking without,

01:08:38.148 --> 01:08:39.814
and start looking within.

01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:44.452
Nimbly weaving between
intrigue and romance,

01:08:44.488 --> 01:08:45.921
the story challenges us to break

01:08:45.956 --> 01:08:48.523
through the outer shells
of its characters,

01:08:48.558 --> 01:08:53.495
the armor we all wear in our daily
lives, to uncover the truth inside.

01:08:54.564 --> 01:08:57.064
The heart is the prize
beneath the veneer,

01:08:57.100 --> 01:09:00.268
and finally the key to
solving the mystery.

01:09:01.071 --> 01:09:04.272
Reneau lets not a single word
astray until the final chapter,

01:09:04.308 --> 01:09:08.243
when the two lead detectives,
inexplicably break away.

01:09:08.278 --> 01:09:10.245
A novel which argues
so convincingly

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:12.346
for our heart's power
to overcome our fears,

01:09:12.381 --> 01:09:14.816
forgets its own lesson
in the final pages.

01:09:22.492 --> 01:09:25.426
Hey, Porter.
Meet me in the library in 30 minutes.

01:09:25.462 --> 01:09:29.229
I'll be there. And if you want to be
a part of this, you will be too,

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:30.698
or I'm going with someone else.

01:09:32.202 --> 01:09:34.102
Fine, you can have 35.

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:41.408
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:09:41.444 --> 01:09:43.211
Sean told me I'd find you here.

01:09:43.981 --> 01:09:45.291
Look, I know you don't have
a lot of time,

01:09:45.314 --> 01:09:48.082
but I had something
I wanted to say.

01:09:48.118 --> 01:09:49.951
Yeah me too.
I'm sorry.

01:09:49.987 --> 01:09:52.087
I shouldn't have
walked out like that.

01:09:52.122 --> 01:09:57.392
When you really care about something,
it's like a bird sitting on your shoulder.

01:09:58.328 --> 01:10:00.628
And you're afraid to
move, because you know

01:10:00.664 --> 01:10:02.375
that there's a chance
that it might fly away.

01:10:02.399 --> 01:10:06.968
But the truth is,
the bird can fly away.

01:10:07.004 --> 01:10:09.471
So you might as well move,
and trust that it'll stay.

01:10:14.978 --> 01:10:16.411
Good luck with your proposal.

01:10:18.015 --> 01:10:19.015
Thanks.

01:10:23.253 --> 01:10:25.720
And if you get stuck,
you can always tell him

01:10:25.756 --> 01:10:28.556
that Lisa liked your board
way better than her Spark.

01:10:28.592 --> 01:10:30.825
Cara.
Lisa rode a Spark?

01:10:31.895 --> 01:10:34.396
That's a pretty high-end
board for a beginner.

01:10:34.431 --> 01:10:36.898
Yeah, she said that
her husband makes them.

01:10:37.868 --> 01:10:44.439
- Porter Mason makes Sparks.
- Wait, Lisa is...

01:10:44.474 --> 01:10:46.007
Porter's wife.

01:10:46.043 --> 01:10:48.777
- How long until Porter's here?
- It should be about 15 minutes.

01:10:48.812 --> 01:10:50.545
I need 25.
You think you can stall?

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:52.747
Easily.
I have plenty of material.

01:11:18.608 --> 01:11:20.442
- Hello?
- Megan!

01:11:20.477 --> 01:11:23.278
Hi, Syndra.
How are you?

01:11:23.313 --> 01:11:25.113
Fantastic.

01:11:25.148 --> 01:11:27.782
I love the photo spread
for the resort.

01:11:27.818 --> 01:11:29.117
Good, good.

01:11:29.152 --> 01:11:31.653
Ethan sent me what
the two of put together.

01:11:32.322 --> 01:11:36.191
Travel Through the Five Senses.
It looks amazing.

01:11:36.226 --> 01:11:37.859
Great.
Thank you.

01:11:37.894 --> 01:11:39.494
Travel section is a go.

01:11:39.529 --> 01:11:41.830
I'll edit, and you'll
manage production.

01:11:41.865 --> 01:11:43.810
I know you're already slammed
as operations manager,

01:11:43.834 --> 01:11:46.067
but if anyone
can pull it off, it's you.

01:11:48.505 --> 01:11:49.571
No.

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:54.309
- What?
- I'm sorry, I can't do both.

01:11:54.344 --> 01:11:55.210
Really?

01:11:55.245 --> 01:11:57.712
I'm sorry, Syndra.
I just don't have the time.

01:11:57.747 --> 01:11:59.280
And Ethan's great.

01:11:59.316 --> 01:12:01.950
He's over-qualified
working under me right now.

01:12:01.985 --> 01:12:04.252
You should really let him
take the travel section.

01:12:04.287 --> 01:12:05.787
Well okay,

01:12:05.822 --> 01:12:07.922
so you'll only do
twice as much work

01:12:07.958 --> 01:12:10.825
as anyone else instead
of three times as much.

01:12:10.861 --> 01:12:13.094
Feel free to send me
two paychecks.

01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:15.396
Sorry, you're breaking up.

01:12:16.399 --> 01:12:18.466
Hey, Syndra.
Thanks for listening.

01:12:19.302 --> 01:12:21.537
- I'll see you at the office.
- Can't wait.

01:12:50.734 --> 01:12:51.734
Look out!

01:12:54.538 --> 01:12:57.372
Are you okay?
I'm so sorry.

01:12:57.407 --> 01:13:00.442
I couldn't stop myself.
I...

01:13:01.411 --> 01:13:02.677
You gotta be kidding me.

01:13:03.914 --> 01:13:05.625
Well, looks like we can retire
all those jokes

01:13:05.649 --> 01:13:07.749
about me running
into you last year.

01:13:07.784 --> 01:13:08.983
Are you okay?

01:13:09.019 --> 01:13:11.986
Let me, I don't know,
I gotta check.

01:13:12.022 --> 01:13:14.289
- I might have a little...
- No.

01:13:14.324 --> 01:13:16.524
- I might need to see the doctor.
- Okay, who do I call?

01:13:18.995 --> 01:13:22.363
- Sean, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:13:22.399 --> 01:13:23.331
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

01:13:23.366 --> 01:13:25.066
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

01:13:27.571 --> 01:13:30.872
And that's how you justify the cost
but keep the low price point.

01:13:30.907 --> 01:13:34.175
From Seattle to the Swiss Alps,
everyone starts somewhere.

01:13:34.211 --> 01:13:36.444
A board for beginners.

01:13:36.479 --> 01:13:37.879
It's a board for everyone.

01:13:41.851 --> 01:13:43.318
Does this thing have a name?

01:13:43.353 --> 01:13:47.422
It's strong, light, graceful,
feels like a part of you.

01:13:47.457 --> 01:13:49.958
And she'll carry you to places
you could only dream.

01:13:52.262 --> 01:13:53.262
The Wing.

01:13:54.064 --> 01:13:55.064
The Wing.

01:13:57.067 --> 01:13:58.067
That's good.

01:13:59.202 --> 01:14:00.646
But if I'm going into
production on this scale,

01:14:00.670 --> 01:14:02.537
I need to see this thing
in action.

01:14:02.572 --> 01:14:05.707
I thought you might say that.
Come with me.

01:14:12.415 --> 01:14:13.548
See anyone you know?

01:14:21.458 --> 01:14:22.557
Lisa?

01:14:23.226 --> 01:14:25.194
- You got this.
- Okay.

01:14:25.729 --> 01:14:28.630
With this board and helmet
I feel like I could fly!

01:14:31.635 --> 01:14:32.635
Here goes!

01:14:42.779 --> 01:14:44.345
She looks like a natural.

01:14:45.415 --> 01:14:47.015
Everyone starts somewhere.

01:14:50.553 --> 01:14:51.553
Yeah!

01:14:52.489 --> 01:14:53.489
Alright!

01:14:55.992 --> 01:14:58.626
- I think you're ready?
- Yeah, you're right.

01:14:59.663 --> 01:15:01.095
- I know.
- That was really...

01:15:01.131 --> 01:15:03.598
Honey, that was incredible.

01:15:04.467 --> 01:15:06.467
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

01:15:06.536 --> 01:15:08.436
Between Ben's board,
and a few lessons

01:15:08.471 --> 01:15:09.804
from my coach back there,

01:15:09.839 --> 01:15:11.706
I had a lot of help.

01:15:11.741 --> 01:15:14.942
- I am impressed.
- And look at this great helmet.

01:15:14.978 --> 01:15:18.513
It actually fits
with a ponytail.

01:15:19.449 --> 01:15:21.060
You have no idea what
a pain it is otherwise.

01:15:21.084 --> 01:15:22.483
It's another prototype.

01:15:22.519 --> 01:15:23.651
Well, this settles it.

01:15:23.687 --> 01:15:25.353
I want to start
making these boards,

01:15:25.388 --> 01:15:27.622
and these helmets,
as quickly as possible.

01:15:27.657 --> 01:15:31.025
What do you say, Ben?
Spread our Wings?

01:15:31.061 --> 01:15:33.027
I say that sounds great.

01:15:34.230 --> 01:15:35.508
Ben, if you ever
doubted yourself

01:15:35.532 --> 01:15:37.765
after leaving Cyan,
you're the only one.

01:15:37.801 --> 01:15:40.535
The rest of this industry knows
you're the real deal.

01:15:44.207 --> 01:15:49.177
I'm so proud of you.

01:15:49.179 --> 01:15:51.145
- Am I doing this right?
- Absolutely.

01:15:51.181 --> 01:15:52.191
That's all it takes
to be a doctor.

01:15:52.215 --> 01:15:54.749
Just moving things around
and poking randomly.

01:15:56.519 --> 01:15:57.552
Well I don't know.

01:15:57.587 --> 01:16:00.189
- Megan, I'm fine.
- Okay.

01:16:02.125 --> 01:16:04.692
I was actually hoping
I'd run into you.

01:16:04.728 --> 01:16:06.627
Sorry I beat you to the punch.

01:16:08.998 --> 01:16:09.998
Megan.

01:16:13.169 --> 01:16:16.604
When I told you the last time
I was truly happy it was up here,

01:16:16.639 --> 01:16:17.772
I was telling the truth.

01:16:19.109 --> 01:16:20.408
But I realize now that it wasn't

01:16:20.443 --> 01:16:22.543
just being up here
that made me happy,

01:16:23.646 --> 01:16:24.912
it was being with you.

01:16:28.385 --> 01:16:30.051
I feel the same way too, Sean.

01:16:31.287 --> 01:16:32.798
No one's filled my
vacancy at the hospital,

01:16:32.822 --> 01:16:36.224
I could come back to Seattle.
Let's take this thing seriously.

01:16:41.865 --> 01:16:44.866
This weekend, I realized that
I've been putting my career

01:16:44.901 --> 01:16:47.802
in front of people who are
really important to me.

01:16:49.139 --> 01:16:50.671
So I guess what I'm saying is,

01:16:53.243 --> 01:16:54.976
no more missed connections.

01:17:11.394 --> 01:17:12.394
It's Ben.

01:17:13.897 --> 01:17:14.629
Hello?

01:17:14.664 --> 01:17:16.731
Hey, Sean.
Are you with Megan?

01:17:16.766 --> 01:17:19.000
- She's around.
- Great.

01:17:19.035 --> 01:17:20.312
I need Cara out of the chalet
for a couple hours.

01:17:20.336 --> 01:17:23.704
You remember that plan
I told you about?

01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:24.605
It's back on.

01:17:24.641 --> 01:17:25.807
Really?

01:17:25.842 --> 01:17:26.842
Yeah.

01:17:27.644 --> 01:17:28.644
We're on it.

01:17:30.914 --> 01:17:32.680
I need your help with something.

01:17:36.719 --> 01:17:38.619
No, I know why you wanted
the new ending

01:17:38.655 --> 01:17:41.889
but it's truer to the characters
if they end up together.

01:17:43.693 --> 01:17:45.860
Great, thanks for being
so understanding.

01:17:52.035 --> 01:17:53.179
Any chance you can get Amanda

01:17:53.203 --> 01:17:55.803
to write a second review
on the manuscript?

01:17:55.839 --> 01:17:57.316
They're letting you go back
to the old ending?

01:17:57.340 --> 01:17:58.906
Well, it took some convincing

01:17:58.942 --> 01:18:01.876
but the publishers are
sending up a new mock-up.

01:18:03.746 --> 01:18:05.146
I'm proud of you, Cara.

01:18:08.518 --> 01:18:11.118
I am wiped.

01:18:11.154 --> 01:18:13.554
How long were we out there?
Two, three hours?

01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:14.889
Was it that long?

01:18:15.825 --> 01:18:17.258
Time flies on a snowboard.

01:18:18.461 --> 01:18:20.795
I'm glad we just got
some uninterrupted fun.

01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:23.698
Yes.
Just like the good old days.

01:18:23.733 --> 01:18:24.832
Alright.

01:18:24.868 --> 01:18:27.168
Well I guess I'm gonna
head back to the chalet.

01:18:27.203 --> 01:18:28.603
- Okay.
- You're gonna come?

01:18:28.638 --> 01:18:31.272
No, I'm just gonna catch up
with some work.

01:18:31.307 --> 01:18:33.608
Work? Really?

01:18:33.643 --> 01:18:35.683
Cause that just looks like
pictures of you and Sean.

01:18:36.946 --> 01:18:37.946
Alright.

01:18:44.454 --> 01:18:47.054
What did I do to deserve
a friend like you?

01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:50.791
- I guess you're just lucky.
- You got that right.

01:18:50.827 --> 01:18:52.593
Alright.

01:18:52.629 --> 01:18:54.396
- See ya.
- See ya.

01:20:43.539 --> 01:20:45.640
Agatha Christie.

01:20:45.675 --> 01:20:49.910
I was reading it last year.
You tried to spoil the ending.

01:20:49.946 --> 01:20:51.379
This is incredible.

01:20:53.983 --> 01:20:57.685
I've read it twice since then,
even though I know what happens.

01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:01.822
And I realize, even
if I can't surprise you,

01:21:01.858 --> 01:21:03.991
it doesn't mean
you won't enjoy the story.

01:21:05.595 --> 01:21:06.727
How did you do all this?

01:21:08.531 --> 01:21:12.400
I had a little help from Sean.
I had a lot of help from Sean.

01:21:15.238 --> 01:21:16.238
Cara.

01:21:16.973 --> 01:21:20.574
You are the single most unbelievable
person I've ever met in my life.

01:21:21.577 --> 01:21:22.977
Oh gosh.

01:21:23.012 --> 01:21:25.146
And I don't know
where this story goes,

01:21:25.181 --> 01:21:28.949
but all I know is
if we're together,

01:21:30.953 --> 01:21:32.183
it will have a happy ending.

01:21:33.923 --> 01:21:35.623
Cara Reneau...

01:21:41.898 --> 01:21:43.097
Will you marry me?

01:21:45.835 --> 01:21:50.172
- You know you got one thing wrong.
- What?

01:21:51.174 --> 01:21:56.377
You surprise me every day
with how wonderful you are.

01:21:56.412 --> 01:21:58.850
Of course I'll marry you.
