00:29.596 --> 00:30.930
-Ready?
-Always.

00:34.167 --> 00:36.669
Robots. Too small to see

00:49.516 --> 00:51.684

-You haven't got

01:45.538 --> 01:47.507
You're a genius.
What would Einstein do?

01:47.574 --> 01:49.976

01:56.616 --> 02:00.119
<i>-Purpose.</i>
-I was expecting wire
cutters here, not chit-chat.

02:00.186 --> 02:02.622
And what is your purpose?
What did Mum tell you
was your purpose?

02:02.689 --> 02:04.390
<i>To defend and protect Earth.</i>

02:04.457 --> 02:07.527
-And that purpose over-rides
all other protocols?
<i>-Yes.</i>

02:07.594 --> 02:10.530
-Ten Earth seconds.
-Mum's orders endanger Earth.

02:10.597 --> 02:13.199
Your purpose over-rides
her command. You have
to stop the detonation.

02:13.266 --> 02:16.936
<i>-Your point seems logical.</i>
<i>I must consider it.</i>
-No! Just do it!

02:31.050 --> 02:35.555
Now, Mr Yorke,
input the nanoform

02:42.896 --> 02:45.765

I've brought blueprints.

03:00.046 --> 03:01.748

03:11.291 --> 03:14.961
MR SMITH: <i>In 1947, a spaceship</i>
<i>crash-landed in New Mexico.</i>

03:15.161 --> 03:16.629
You're talking about Roswell.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.731
You mean that really happened?
Come on. Try to keep up.

03:18.798 --> 03:22.302
<i>The US military re-engineered</i>

03:22.368 --> 03:24.137

03:26.906 --> 03:28.875
She's taken them to Genetec.

03:28.942 --> 03:31.744
Of course, nanoform technology
could build it from raw atoms.

03:31.811 --> 03:33.947
What are you talking about?

03:34.013 --> 03:36.783
Oh, Mum was doing an article
on nanoforms, tiny robots
that can build anything.

03:36.849 --> 03:38.818
Androvax is going to get
them to build him a spaceship.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.687
Before the Judoon get here
in 30 minutes?

03:40.753 --> 03:43.389
But nanoforms have
to be stored dormant
at sub-zero temperatures

03:43.456 --> 03:45.959
because of the massive energy
they create when activated.

03:46.159 --> 03:49.963
-They're fast, Clyde.
-Must hurry.
Stop Androvax escaping.

03:50.163 --> 03:52.665

03:52.732 --> 03:55.535
<i>So my self-destruct</i>

03:55.602 --> 03:57.770
Yeah. Well, Androvax
isn't going to leg it
with Sarah Jane,

03:57.837 --> 04:01.174

him, before Captain Tybo's

04:13.620 --> 04:16.189
SARAH JANE: They're responding
to my programming.

04:16.255 --> 04:19.791
The safety protocols can't
cope with that rate
of multiplication.

04:19.858 --> 04:22.695
-They'll swarm!
-I'm releasing them, Mr Yorke!

04:22.762 --> 04:25.698
I'm releasing them

04:25.765 --> 04:28.768
If they get into
the environment, they'll take
the whole planet apart!

04:28.835 --> 04:32.438
They have been

04:32.505 --> 04:35.942

12:51.203 --> 12:55.508
Haresh, these are aliens.
Aliens with guns.

12:55.574 --> 12:58.310
I think we should be
calling the police,
not playing I-spy.

12:58.377 --> 13:01.247
Considering the entire
building's locked,
Security took your mobile

13:01.313 --> 13:04.750
and none of the phones
here actually work, I don't
see what else we can do.

13:04.817 --> 13:10.356
(GASPS) My mobile!
The security guard, he's got
my phone, all my contacts.

13:10.422 --> 13:11.891

13:11.957 --> 13:13.926
What if they disintegrate him?
I'll be proper scuppered.

13:15.728 --> 13:18.631
Come on,
we'd better go and find it.

13:18.697 --> 13:21.300
There are more
Judoon here now.
They'll find you.

13:21.367 --> 13:24.436
So take your spaceship
and give me my mum back.

13:24.503 --> 13:25.838
I don't think so.

13:25.905 --> 13:28.874
I've come to know Sarah Jane
quite well.

13:28.941 --> 13:31.911
And I don't see her
as the type to wave me off.

13:31.977 --> 13:35.414

Take over someone else's body?
It's horrible!

you're human children.

13:51.897 --> 13:57.269
You've barely dried off

And all you've evolved into
is a killer,

14:17.456 --> 14:19.925

over other people's bodies?

14:20.960 --> 14:22.728
My mum will beat you.

Our sun turned

Aliens? Sir,
you've seen aliens?

26:41.566 --> 26:44.302
Yes. Yes, I have.

26:44.369 --> 26:47.505
Aliens, Gita? Are you sure?

26:47.572 --> 26:50.275
Ten feet tall.
Covered in metal.

26:50.342 --> 26:54.245
With these huge helmets,
like rhinoceroses.

26:54.312 --> 26:56.514
Rhinoceroses. From space?

26:58.049 --> 26:59.617
Sounds like you need
a cup of tea.

26:59.684 --> 27:02.387
Cup of tea, yes, and I'll
tell you all about it.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.823
Come on, Sarah, and don't
forget your notebook.

27:04.889 --> 27:08.126
I'm telling you,
this is a story you
will not want to miss.

27:08.193 --> 27:09.561
This could be
the making of you.

27:10.495 --> 27:12.597
I'll just go and get my pen.

27:15.600 --> 27:18.036
Rhinoceros men?
Come on, sir.

27:18.103 --> 27:19.871
Gita said no one
would believe us.

27:19.938 --> 27:21.606
And would they?

27:21.673 --> 27:25.610
We live in Bannerman Road.
What's going to happen to us?

27:25.677 --> 27:28.913
Oh, that's the wonderful thing
about the universe.

27:30.648 --> 27:32.450
You just never know.

27:36.588 --> 27:38.156
OLD WOMAN: My name is Rani.

27:38.823 --> 27:40.158
Rani Chandra.

27:40.225 --> 27:42.293
This old attic
is full of ghosts.

27:42.360 --> 27:44.829
Ghosts of the people
I used to love.

27:44.896 --> 27:46.731
<i>Playtime is beginning</i> .

27:46.798 --> 27:49.300
SARAH JANE: <i>Rani's been</i>
<i>telling about everything</i>
<i>we do!</i>

27:49.367 --> 27:52.270
She's with her. The demon.

27:52.337 --> 27:53.772
-(LAUGHING)
-DEMON GIRL: <i>I can see</i>
<i>your past.</i>

27:53.838 --> 27:55.774
<i>Sarah Jane, Luke and Clyde.</i>

27:55.840 --> 27:57.308
I wish they'd just
leave me alone.

27:57.375 --> 27:58.043
DEMON GIRL: <i>Do you want</i>
<i>to see your future?</i>
