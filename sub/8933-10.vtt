WEBVTT

00:01.501 --> 00:02.068
This is the Evergreen

00:02.068 --> 00:03.103
This is the
Evergreen forest.

00:03.636 --> 00:06.172
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:08.341 --> 00:10.677
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.677 --> 00:12.312
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.680 --> 00:15.782
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:16.750 --> 00:17.751
Yikes!

00:18.418 --> 00:19.953
Yaaaah...

00:22.655 --> 00:24.024
Yeaaaah!

00:24.024 --> 00:26.926
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:34.134 --> 00:36.603
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:38.304 --> 00:39.539
Cyril Sneer!

00:43.309 --> 00:45.378
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:46.479 --> 00:46.946
the Raccoons!!

00:47.881 --> 00:50.283
♪ (show theme music) ♪

01:01.361 --> 01:04.497
Sometimes our own
imaginations conjure up

01:04.497 --> 01:08.134
ghosts and spirits
that can seem very real

01:08.134 --> 01:11.871
and sometimes we can end up
running away from something

01:11.871 --> 01:13.606
that isn't there at all.

01:13.606 --> 01:15.875
Ahhh!

01:15.875 --> 01:18.378
Cut it out, Bert!

01:18.378 --> 01:20.880
Why do you have to
tell ghost stories,

01:20.880 --> 01:23.249
when we are heading
to the Clubhouse

01:23.249 --> 01:25.585
to spend the
night alone...

01:25.585 --> 01:27.087
in the dark.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.421
Alone!

01:28.421 --> 01:31.491
(giggles) You
don't really believe ghosts,

01:31.491 --> 01:32.926
do you, Cedric?

01:37.230 --> 01:40.767
And then, just
before the sun rose,

01:40.767 --> 01:43.770
the ghosts made
a final visit.

01:43.770 --> 01:48.441
People in the village heard the
clanking of chains

01:48.441 --> 01:51.845
and blood curdling screams.

01:53.179 --> 01:55.415
The Banshee! It's got me!

01:55.415 --> 01:57.016
Help! Help!

01:57.016 --> 01:58.751
(giggles) Look, Bert,

01:58.751 --> 02:00.520
it's just a branch.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.655
Oh, oh ya!

02:02.655 --> 02:05.091
He-he, oh!

02:05.091 --> 02:06.092
Come on.

02:10.864 --> 02:13.066
Here we are, Cedric.

02:15.268 --> 02:18.271
Cedric, there's
someone in there!

02:18.271 --> 02:21.141
Or s-s-something!

02:22.142 --> 02:23.143
Broo!?

02:28.581 --> 02:30.283
That's not
going to do much good

02:30.283 --> 02:33.019
against a g-g-ghost, Bert.

02:37.524 --> 02:40.226
Broo, I'll save you!

02:43.363 --> 02:44.597
I got it! I got it!

02:44.597 --> 02:45.732
Get the lights, Cedric!

02:45.732 --> 02:47.000
Ow!

02:47.000 --> 02:49.102
Huh? Bentley?!

02:49.102 --> 02:50.303
Bert!

02:54.774 --> 02:56.743
Computers?!
Who needs them!

02:56.743 --> 02:59.379
I don't know how I let
you talk me into this?

02:59.379 --> 03:03.483
But boss, you can't run a
business without computers.

03:03.483 --> 03:05.084
They can do your books.

03:05.084 --> 03:07.587
They can make your
investment decisions,

03:07.587 --> 03:09.656
predict the stock market,

03:09.656 --> 03:11.691
um... keep your recipes.

03:11.691 --> 03:14.794
Pig 2: Hi-hi! They do
everything for you.

03:14.794 --> 03:18.031
Pig 3: Yes, and they
never ever make mistakes.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.933
That will be
a refreshing change

03:19.933 --> 03:22.635
from you three overfed foul-ups!

03:22.635 --> 03:24.137
Get busy!

03:24.137 --> 03:26.639
I want this thing
working pronto!

03:29.809 --> 03:31.644
Bentley, do you
want chocolate pudding

03:31.644 --> 03:33.179
with your waffles?

03:33.179 --> 03:34.614
I don't care.

03:34.614 --> 03:36.482
You don't seem
to care very much

03:36.482 --> 03:38.885
about anything
right now, Bentley.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.520
Don't
you start too, Bert.

03:40.520 --> 03:41.888
That's why I ran away.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.224
My parents are always
on my back!

03:44.224 --> 03:45.825
And my teachers!

03:45.825 --> 03:47.493
And the principal.

03:47.493 --> 03:49.963
Your parents
have got to be worried.

03:49.963 --> 03:51.598
Why don't you call them?

03:51.598 --> 03:52.865
What's the
point of running away,

03:52.865 --> 03:54.534
if I've got to
call my parents?

03:54.534 --> 03:56.236
I don't want them
to know, where I am.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.837
I don't want anyone to know;

03:57.837 --> 04:00.406
especially aunt Melissa
and uncle Ralph.

04:00.406 --> 04:01.741
Promise?

04:01.741 --> 04:04.577
Gee, Bentley,
I don't know.

04:04.577 --> 04:05.778
Promise!

04:05.778 --> 04:07.513
Oh, ok!

04:07.513 --> 04:10.350
I won't tell anyone. Promise.

04:10.350 --> 04:12.252
Aaaaaagh!

04:12.252 --> 04:13.486
Chow time!

04:14.921 --> 04:17.457
Pig 2: There, we've got the I/O

04:17.457 --> 04:20.126
interfaced with the serial port.

04:20.126 --> 04:22.028
Too bad! Can you fix it?

04:22.028 --> 04:25.265
Pig 3: Ah,
He means, it's on, Sir.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.766
In what language?

04:26.766 --> 04:29.769
Pig 3: There's one of these in
every room in the house, Sir.

04:29.769 --> 04:32.905
All connected to
the master computer.

04:32.905 --> 04:35.375
Pig 2: You can control
everything in the house

04:35.375 --> 04:37.010
from any terminal:

04:37.010 --> 04:38.611
electrical system,

04:38.611 --> 04:39.712
security,

04:39.712 --> 04:42.415
even the lawn sprinklers.

04:42.415 --> 04:44.183
Pig 3: Watch this, boss!

04:44.183 --> 04:47.887
Computer, activate
security system.

04:52.725 --> 04:53.726
Activated!

04:54.694 --> 04:57.230
Impressive, eh, boss?

04:57.230 --> 05:00.667
Computer, security system off.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.773
Hey, that's
pretty good.

05:06.773 --> 05:08.908
This thing has possibilities.

05:08.908 --> 05:10.310
Now get back to work.

05:10.310 --> 05:13.946
I want that gold inventory
on my desk tomorrow.

05:13.946 --> 05:15.081
Yes, Sir!

05:19.319 --> 05:23.256
The computer finished
the inventory hours ago.

05:23.256 --> 05:26.893
Pig 2: So we can take
the afternoon off.

05:36.202 --> 05:39.138
Well, let's see now.
What would Bentley like?

05:39.639 --> 05:43.609
Hmm.. Ah, 'Plant Science'.

05:43.609 --> 05:44.944
Hm, not bad.

05:44.944 --> 05:47.480
'Wonders of Chemistry'.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.482
Hey, these will do.

05:52.518 --> 05:54.287
Hi, Bert.
What have you got there?

05:54.287 --> 05:58.157
Oh! Um-oh-eh...
just a few provisions.

05:58.157 --> 06:00.960
Um, yeah! The stockpile
at the old Clubhouse

06:00.960 --> 06:03.129
is running low, you know.

06:03.129 --> 06:05.665
Don't forget your
story for today's Standard

06:05.665 --> 06:07.667
has to be finished
by this afternoon.

06:07.667 --> 06:09.335
As good as
written, Ralph.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.008
How's Bentley
holding up, Cedric?

06:16.008 --> 06:18.978
He still won't talk
about going home, Bert.

06:18.978 --> 06:20.446
Well, don't worry.

06:20.446 --> 06:22.582
I'll get him to go home.

06:22.582 --> 06:25.852
You just got to know
how to handle kids.

06:25.852 --> 06:28.554
Firmness and understanding,

06:28.554 --> 06:30.189
that's all it takes.

06:30.189 --> 06:32.158
Here you are, Bentley,

06:32.158 --> 06:33.826
this should keep you
going for a while.

06:33.826 --> 06:36.729
Hey, I even brought some books
I thought, you might like.

06:36.729 --> 06:38.364
Thanks
a lot, Bert.

06:38.364 --> 06:39.665
You are a real...

06:39.665 --> 06:41.567
College Mathematics?

06:41.567 --> 06:43.903
You talked to my
parents, didn't you?!

06:43.903 --> 06:45.705
And they told you,
didn't they?

06:45.705 --> 06:48.074
And you promised!!!

06:48.074 --> 06:50.843
I-I don't know what you
are talking about, Bentley.

06:50.843 --> 06:54.046
Sure, then how did you
know about the mathematics?

06:54.046 --> 06:56.315
You were just trying
to make me feel guilty.

06:56.315 --> 06:58.251
W-wh-wh about what?

06:58.885 --> 07:01.854
Hey, did you fail
math or something?

07:01.854 --> 07:03.356
As if you didn't know.

07:03.356 --> 07:07.059
Breaking into the school system
was easy with my computer.

07:07.059 --> 07:09.595
So, what if I gave
myself a better mark?

07:09.595 --> 07:11.264
I wanted to be first!

07:11.264 --> 07:13.065
So I cheated.

07:13.065 --> 07:14.567
Big deal!

07:15.368 --> 07:17.737
So now you know,
why I ran away.

07:18.938 --> 07:21.207
I'm a... criminal.

07:21.841 --> 07:23.009
And I don't care!!

07:27.046 --> 07:29.582
Ah, this is the life.

07:31.417 --> 07:33.719
Pig 2: Well, we're
done on this side.

07:33.719 --> 07:37.690
What did we ever do
before we got this computer?

07:37.690 --> 07:39.559
Pig 3: Ah! Too much!

07:42.528 --> 07:44.497
I wonder where the boss is?

07:44.497 --> 07:47.567
Computer, where is the boss?

07:47.567 --> 07:53.473
♪ I dream of money,
that I'll never share. ♪

07:53.473 --> 07:56.776
Pig 2: The boss can't
even sneak up on us now.

07:56.776 --> 08:00.913
There is only one thing we
need to make life perfect.

08:00.913 --> 08:02.315
A raise!

08:02.315 --> 08:05.151
And I know
just how to get one.

08:05.151 --> 08:09.622
Pig 2: Oh boy, I love it,
when you get an idea.

08:10.890 --> 08:13.626
We could use some help
with these dishes, Bentley.

08:13.626 --> 08:15.027
Oh, lay off!

08:15.027 --> 08:17.563
I don't have to do
anything, I don't want to.

08:17.563 --> 08:20.299
Ok, I've
had enough of this!

08:20.299 --> 08:22.502
Big tough guy, huh!

08:22.502 --> 08:24.003
Shhh, he'll hear you.

08:24.003 --> 08:25.838
Doesn't need anybody.

08:25.838 --> 08:28.741
Makes a mistake and
then can't face up to it.

08:28.741 --> 08:30.176
Runs away!

08:30.176 --> 08:33.179
Bert, remember, understanding.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.515
This has got to be said.

08:35.515 --> 08:39.352
So you want a life on
the road, eh Bentley?

08:39.352 --> 08:42.488
No home, no
family, no friends,

08:42.488 --> 08:45.791
you want to be a,
a fugitive, right?

08:45.791 --> 08:48.728
That's right.
A fugitive.

08:48.728 --> 08:50.963
Never knowing if
the next person you see

08:50.963 --> 08:53.032
is gonna put the finger
on you and say,

08:53.032 --> 08:56.836
'There! That's the kid who
cheeted on his math mark'

08:56.836 --> 08:58.871
Huh, some life!

08:58.871 --> 09:00.573
Is that what you want?

09:00.573 --> 09:03.543
Maybe.. maybe not.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.711
What else is there?

09:05.711 --> 09:06.812
Well...

09:07.713 --> 09:10.816
For starters, come and
help us with the dishes.

09:10.816 --> 09:13.219
We'll figure out
the rest later, ok?

09:13.219 --> 09:14.787
Ok, Bert.

09:17.990 --> 09:20.526
Bert, we've been
looking all over for you.

09:20.526 --> 09:22.495
Where is that column
you promised me?

09:22.495 --> 09:25.064
Bentley!
What are you doing here?

09:25.064 --> 09:27.567
Great! You
promised not to tell.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.135
Thanks a lot, Bert!

09:29.835 --> 09:31.804
I can't trust anyone!

09:32.405 --> 09:35.575
Bentley wait! Bentley!

09:35.575 --> 09:37.677
What is going on here?

09:41.013 --> 09:43.282
Ok, Bentley, I've
talked to your parents

09:43.282 --> 09:44.850
and they are very worried.

09:44.850 --> 09:47.753
They said it's all right for
you to stay here for a while.

09:47.753 --> 09:49.255
I told them you were ok,

09:49.255 --> 09:51.657
but they'd rather
hear it from you.

09:51.657 --> 09:52.625
It'd be better off

09:52.625 --> 09:54.660
if they never heard
from me again.

09:54.660 --> 09:57.330
That's a terrible
thing to say, Bentley.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.365
I think
I'll take a walk.

10:00.066 --> 10:01.767
I'll go with
you, little buddy.

10:01.767 --> 10:04.070
I'd rather
be alone, Bert.

10:05.504 --> 10:09.375
Don't worry; I'm this
close to straightening him out.

10:09.375 --> 10:11.410
I got a way with kids.

11:51.844 --> 11:54.380
Now all we have
to do is change it,

11:54.380 --> 11:56.549
and give ourselves a raise.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.552
Pig 2: Our first raise... ever!

11:59.552 --> 12:02.722
Hu-huu-hu! I can hardly wait.

12:02.722 --> 12:06.525
Pig 3: (giggles) Isn't it great
to be computer literate?

12:06.525 --> 12:08.828
He, yeah, hi-hi,

12:08.828 --> 12:11.163
and the boss
will never know.

12:11.163 --> 12:14.066
Know what,
you shifty swine?

12:14.066 --> 12:15.201
Oh no!

12:17.203 --> 12:18.237
Boss!

12:18.237 --> 12:20.172
Warning! Warning!

12:20.172 --> 12:22.108
This system under attack!

12:22.108 --> 12:24.877
Self protection
program in effect.

12:24.877 --> 12:27.113
This building is sealed.
Huh?

12:27.113 --> 12:31.250
Destroy all invaders!
Now you've done it,

12:31.250 --> 12:33.352
you half-witted ham hocks!

12:33.352 --> 12:35.921
This gizmo has flipped
it's floppy disks.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.790
Destroy all invaders!

12:37.790 --> 12:38.791
What's it talking about,

12:38.791 --> 12:40.259
there are no invaders!

12:42.762 --> 12:46.232
The computer
has gone crazy!

12:46.232 --> 12:48.033
Pigs/Cyril: Uaaaaaah!

12:50.169 --> 12:52.905
Uah!

12:52.905 --> 12:55.875
Invader alert!

12:55.875 --> 12:57.777
Pig 2: Master, Cedric. Ho-ho-ho!

12:57.777 --> 12:58.911
Do something!

12:58.911 --> 13:01.080
The computer has gone bananas!

13:01.080 --> 13:05.050
Cedric, this demented
databank has got us trapped!

13:05.050 --> 13:06.385
Get us out of here!

13:07.419 --> 13:08.420
Pop!

13:09.622 --> 13:10.623
Uaaaah!

13:10.623 --> 13:12.558
Yeaaaah!

13:16.996 --> 13:19.365
Well, there it is.

13:19.365 --> 13:22.802
A brilliant story on Mr. Mammoth

13:22.802 --> 13:26.138
from the pen
of Bert Raccoon,

13:26.138 --> 13:30.609
ably assisted by the flying
fingers of Bentley Raccoon.

13:30.609 --> 13:33.445
Oh, Ralph
is going to love it.

13:33.445 --> 13:35.981
Bert, Bentley come on!

13:35.981 --> 13:37.049
It's Pop.

13:37.049 --> 13:39.084
Something is wrong
with the new computer.

13:39.084 --> 13:40.820
It's trapped them in the house.

13:40.820 --> 13:41.887
What?

13:44.156 --> 13:47.293
Great, I'm a
prisoner in my own home

13:47.293 --> 13:49.295
by a computer no less.

13:49.295 --> 13:51.730
It can do everything, you said.

13:51.730 --> 13:54.400
It never makes
mistakes, you said.

13:54.400 --> 13:58.904
(laughs) Just a few
bugs in the system, Sir.

13:58.904 --> 14:01.540
And you bug brains
programmed the system.

14:01.540 --> 14:04.443
I'll reprogram you,
when we get out of here!

14:05.244 --> 14:08.514
Now get on that phone
and get us some help!

14:11.617 --> 14:14.787
Hello! Oh my,
is anybody there?

14:14.787 --> 14:16.488
We need help!

14:16.488 --> 14:18.757
Pronto!
Pronto!

14:18.757 --> 14:21.927
Self-protection
program still in effect!

14:21.927 --> 14:23.929
Communications frozen!

14:23.929 --> 14:27.199
Locate and destroy invaders!

14:27.199 --> 14:30.102
I think it's
still mad at us, boss.

14:30.102 --> 14:31.971
Pig 2: It's hopeless, boss.

14:31.971 --> 14:35.274
The computer controls every
system in the house.

14:35.274 --> 14:37.509
No one can get in or out.

14:37.509 --> 14:42.114
Locate invaders!

14:46.452 --> 14:48.320
I think I can
shut down the computer,

14:48.320 --> 14:50.990
but I've got to get
into the system somehow.

14:50.990 --> 14:53.993
Hey, that telephone line
would do it.

14:53.993 --> 14:56.295
Well, let's go, men.

14:57.663 --> 14:59.598
Yeaaah...

15:00.933 --> 15:03.502
This is the
height of cowardess!

15:03.502 --> 15:05.638
Sneaking out of my own basement.

15:05.638 --> 15:09.341
And remember,
I'm going first.

15:09.341 --> 15:11.010
Aaaaahh!

15:11.010 --> 15:14.813
I've told you pitiful
porkers a thousand times,

15:14.813 --> 15:16.715
don't leave your
hockey equipment

15:16.715 --> 15:18.217
at the bottom of the stairs!

15:18.217 --> 15:19.818
O-oh!

15:19.818 --> 15:23.722
Invaders found!

15:25.324 --> 15:26.392
Peace?

15:27.393 --> 15:29.561
Pigs/Cyril: Aaah! Oh-oooh!

15:29.561 --> 15:31.664
Ah-oh-eh-ah!

15:34.733 --> 15:36.201
Uh-oh-uh!

15:39.104 --> 15:40.239
What?!

15:41.707 --> 15:44.843
Pig 1: Uh-oh!
Pig 2: Oh no! Help!

15:44.843 --> 15:48.213
Somebody help! Heeeelp!

15:48.213 --> 15:51.550
Auuuuu!

15:51.550 --> 15:54.219
Phew, made it!

15:55.387 --> 15:58.724
But my sweater will
never be the same.

16:06.732 --> 16:08.934
All right,
I'm inside the system.

16:08.934 --> 16:12.471
Let's see if we can find them
on the security camera.

16:16.709 --> 16:17.743
Pop!

16:19.945 --> 16:22.481
Pop! Oh no!

16:26.151 --> 16:28.153
That's
one bank shut down.

16:29.588 --> 16:31.223
Hurry, Bentley!

16:31.857 --> 16:33.959
Of course you
realise you've pawned

16:33.959 --> 16:36.662
your last chance of
ever getting a raise!

16:36.662 --> 16:39.398
Seems fair to us, Sir.

16:46.338 --> 16:49.742
Bert/Cedric: Yah, Bentley!
You did it!

16:49.742 --> 16:52.544
Pigs/Cyril:

16:52.544 --> 16:54.480
Am I glad to see you!

16:54.480 --> 16:56.448
W-wh-what happened?

16:56.448 --> 16:58.384
Bentley broke
into your computer

16:58.384 --> 17:00.185
and turned the whole system off.

17:00.185 --> 17:01.453
Pretty good, eh?

17:01.453 --> 17:03.655
Pretty good?
That's brilliant!

17:03.655 --> 17:06.492
Bentley, my boy,
you've got a great talent.

17:06.492 --> 17:10.095
Yeah! He's got a real
feel for computers, Pop.

17:10.095 --> 17:12.097
There aren't many like Bentley!

17:12.097 --> 17:13.465
I can see that.

17:13.465 --> 17:16.001
Bentley, as soon as
you finish school,

17:16.001 --> 17:18.103
I want you to come
and work for me.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.439
What's the matter with him?

17:20.439 --> 17:23.175
He's a bit sensitive
about school right now.

17:23.175 --> 17:25.144
I'll tell you later, Pop.

17:27.279 --> 17:29.882
Admit it, Bert,
it's too crowded.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.384
We just
don't have enough room.

17:32.384 --> 17:33.986
I guess, you are right.

17:33.986 --> 17:35.654
Somebody has got to go.

17:35.654 --> 17:37.623
Then we are
agreed, he's out.

17:37.623 --> 17:40.859
Don't worry, Bert,
it's a great story.

17:40.859 --> 17:42.861
We'll put it in
the next edition.

17:44.029 --> 17:48.233
Dear Bert, I overheard
you talking to Ralph and Melissa

17:48.233 --> 17:49.802
and you're right.

17:49.802 --> 17:52.504
I don't blame you for not
wanting me around,

17:52.504 --> 17:54.506
so I guess I'll move on.

17:54.506 --> 17:56.809
I won't be in your way anymore.

17:56.809 --> 18:00.045
See you sometime.. maybe.

18:00.045 --> 18:01.180
Bentley.

18:08.187 --> 18:11.223
Oh no, poor Bentley!

18:11.223 --> 18:13.559
I don't know,
where he got the idea

18:13.559 --> 18:15.260
we don't want him around.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.995
We'll have a better
chance of finding him,

18:16.995 --> 18:18.097
if we split up.

18:18.730 --> 18:20.199
What is this?

18:20.199 --> 18:21.767
A Raccoon convention?

18:21.767 --> 18:23.602
No time to explain, Pop.

18:26.071 --> 18:29.108
Bentley! Bentley!
Beeeentleyyy!

18:29.108 --> 18:32.044
Beeeentleeeyyy!

18:35.147 --> 18:36.949
Bentley!

18:36.949 --> 18:39.184
Beeentleeeeyy!

18:42.421 --> 18:44.556
I thought I might
find you along here.

18:44.556 --> 18:45.724
Going somewhere?

18:45.724 --> 18:49.294
Huh? Oh,
just away, Mr. Sneer.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.430
I see.
You're running away

18:51.430 --> 18:53.532
because you cheated at school.

18:53.532 --> 18:54.733
How do you know?

18:54.733 --> 18:55.868
Never mind that.

18:55.868 --> 18:58.103
The point is, the only thing
you're running away from

18:58.103 --> 18:59.271
is yourself.

18:59.271 --> 19:02.708
That doesn't work, because
no matter where you go,

19:02.708 --> 19:04.143
there you are.

19:04.143 --> 19:07.446
I want to tell you a
story about a kid, I knew.

19:07.446 --> 19:08.981
He ran away once.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.917
He thought he could make it on
his own without friends,

19:11.917 --> 19:13.118
without parents,

19:13.118 --> 19:14.386
without a home

19:14.386 --> 19:15.420
and do you know what?

19:15.420 --> 19:18.123
Ya, ya, I've
heard it all before.

19:18.123 --> 19:20.559
He ended up poor
and homeless, right?

19:20.559 --> 19:21.627
Wrong!

19:21.627 --> 19:24.696
He's a millionaire, but
there were a lot of lost

19:24.696 --> 19:27.065
and lonely years
before he made it.

19:27.065 --> 19:28.800
And as nice as money is,

19:28.800 --> 19:31.403
it can't buy back those years.

19:31.403 --> 19:33.272
Am I getting through?

19:33.272 --> 19:35.140
I.. I guess so.

19:35.140 --> 19:36.842
You might think
you're tough and brave

19:36.842 --> 19:38.744
running away, but believe me,

19:38.744 --> 19:42.080
it takes more courage to
face up to your mistakes.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.616
Turn back while
there is still time.

19:44.616 --> 19:47.519
Don't be like the kid
in the story, Bentley.

19:47.519 --> 19:50.289
Was that
kid you, Mr. Sneer?

19:55.327 --> 19:57.196
Sneer here.

19:57.196 --> 20:00.832
Ya, he's here too,
like I promised.

20:00.832 --> 20:02.601
Hello?

20:02.601 --> 20:04.803
Mom, Dad?

20:05.537 --> 20:07.272
I'm fine... and you?

20:08.540 --> 20:11.710
Yes, I'm sorry.

20:12.377 --> 20:14.179
I.. I love you too.

20:22.554 --> 20:25.490
There's no trace
of Bentley anywhere!

20:27.693 --> 20:29.561
Bentley, you're all right!

20:29.561 --> 20:31.230
I've never been better.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.898
I just talked to mom and dad.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.900
Everything's going
to be all right.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.368
We're going to work things out.

20:36.368 --> 20:38.704
I just have to get a few
things I left behind,

20:38.704 --> 20:40.239
then I can go home.

20:41.707 --> 20:43.575
But Cyril?!

20:43.575 --> 20:47.145
H-how did you.. I mean,
w-wh-what did you?

20:47.145 --> 20:48.313
Let's just say, I think

20:48.313 --> 20:50.249
we parents should
stick together.

20:50.249 --> 20:53.051
We need all the help we can get.

20:54.686 --> 20:57.022
Come on kid, we
don't have all day.

20:57.022 --> 20:59.558
It's a long drive
to your parent's home.

20:59.558 --> 21:01.660
Hm, can you beat that?

21:02.194 --> 21:03.929
Bye and thanks a lot!

21:04.596 --> 21:08.333
Sometimes we all try
to run away from our problems,

21:08.333 --> 21:10.435
but if we turn and face them,

21:10.435 --> 21:13.038
those problems can be solved

21:13.038 --> 21:14.339
with a little time,

21:14.339 --> 21:15.841
a little courage

21:15.841 --> 21:18.076
and a little help
from our friends.

21:20.112 --> 21:23.282
Anyway, Bentley's been
grounded for a month

21:23.282 --> 21:26.918
and he's got to stay after
school every day

21:26.918 --> 21:28.420
for the rest of the term.

21:28.420 --> 21:29.755
Ouch!

21:29.755 --> 21:31.290
He says he doesn't mind,

21:31.290 --> 21:34.960
because it's better than the
life of a fugitive on the run.

21:34.960 --> 21:39.398
Then Bentley says, please
call Mr. Sneer to tell him

21:39.398 --> 21:41.266
everything is all right now.

21:41.266 --> 21:44.770
I'm not going to be
like that other kid.
