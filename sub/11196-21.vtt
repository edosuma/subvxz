WEBVTT

00:07.840 --> 00:11.913
We have to get to the infirmary.
Daniel's been exposed to radiation.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.639
Have a medical team meet us on the way.

00:14.720 --> 00:18.554
Medical team to Alpha 2.
Repeat, medical team to Alpha 2.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.072
- Colonel, what happened?
- Details are a little sketchy, sir.

00:22.160 --> 00:25.118
We were not present
at the time of the incident.

00:25.200 --> 00:28.590
- Don't touch me!
- He may still be radioactive.

00:34.240 --> 00:36.629
Let's get him scrubbed down.

00:39.640 --> 00:42.074
- Do we know what kind and how much?
- It was a device,

00:42.160 --> 00:45.072
housing an unstable radioactive
variation of naqahdah.

00:45.160 --> 00:47.276
We think his right hand was exposed

00:47.360 --> 00:51.239
to eight to nine grays of neutron radiation
resulting from direct contact.

00:51.320 --> 00:53.959
Full body exposure of over seven.

00:54.040 --> 00:56.759
- Oh, my God.
- Doctor?

00:58.400 --> 01:00.277
It's a lethal dose, sir.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:09.120 --> 02:10.711
As you were.

02:10.800 --> 02:14.873
Dr Fraiser tells me there's nothing more
we can do for Dr Jackson at the moment.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.758
In the meantime, tell me what happened.

02:17.840 --> 02:22.072
Well, sir, as you know, Kelowna is
one of three major countries on 4C3.

02:22.160 --> 02:25.550
What we've learned since
our initial contact is they appear to be

02:25.640 --> 02:29.679
at a similar stage of development
to that of the United States in the 1940s.

02:29.760 --> 02:33.389
Geopolitically, there is obvious
mounting tension between the nations.

02:33.480 --> 02:35.436
Sort of like a cold war, sir.

02:35.520 --> 02:39.115
The Kelownans discovered their Stargate
approximately 15 years ago,

02:39.200 --> 02:43.955
along with a number of Goa'uld artefacts
in what appears to be an ancient temple.

02:44.040 --> 02:46.395
Their knowledge of the gate
is still limited.

02:46.480 --> 02:49.677
But their interest is strong.
We told them what we could offer,

02:49.760 --> 02:52.479
and they were eager to share
any technologies

02:52.560 --> 02:55.233
that could potentially
be offered in exchange.

03:05.360 --> 03:09.433
This is incredible. It is a pleasure
to meet you. I'm Jonas Quinn.

03:09.520 --> 03:11.795
I'm special adviser to our high minister.

03:11.880 --> 03:16.112
- Security's a little tight around here.
- As you've undoubtedly been told,

03:16.200 --> 03:20.876
this is one of our most secret
and important research operations.

03:22.640 --> 03:24.835
Daniel Jackson.

03:26.440 --> 03:29.398
Colonel Jack O'Neill, Major Sam Carter,

03:29.480 --> 03:32.438
and the tall, silent one is Teal'c.

03:33.040 --> 03:38.114
"Teal'c"...Well, your arrival on
our planet is an extraordinary event.

03:38.720 --> 03:42.759
It's my honour to show you around
this facility. Please, follow me.

03:43.720 --> 03:47.998
- He's an adviser to the high minister.
- Their equivalent to our president.

03:48.080 --> 03:51.834
As we understand it, Jonas was
responsible for overseeing the research

03:51.920 --> 03:55.356
- From an ethical perspective.
- Yeah. Whatever.

03:56.120 --> 04:00.352
He had several degrees from their
most honoured education institution:

04:00.440 --> 04:03.989
- Social studies, Kelownan history...
- He was a nerd, sir.

04:05.240 --> 04:07.435
He and Daniel got along great.

04:07.520 --> 04:12.230
If we could have access to the artefacts,
we have a process called carbon dating.

04:12.320 --> 04:17.189
- I could determine the age of the temple.
- I'm sure that can be arranged.

04:17.279 --> 04:21.067
Our archaeologists believe they've only
begun to uncover what may be buried.

04:21.160 --> 04:25.597
- There were extensive alien writings.
- Teal'c and I could help with translation.

04:25.680 --> 04:29.753
I understand that your knowledge and
expertise will come at a price, Colonel.

04:29.840 --> 04:32.991
- That is why you are here, right?
- Don't get me wrong.

04:33.080 --> 04:35.230
We wanna help out as much as we can.

04:35.320 --> 04:38.437
It's just that we've been
burned a little in past relations.

04:38.520 --> 04:41.239
We're not questioning
what you offer in return...

04:41.320 --> 04:43.959
- We want to get to know you better first.
- That's it.

04:44.040 --> 04:47.919
Still, hopefully we'll have
much of value to offer in exchange.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.195
This way.

05:16.120 --> 05:17.792
We can go in now.

05:33.880 --> 05:35.871
This is Tomis Lee.

05:35.960 --> 05:41.717
He is chief physicist overseeing the
development of our most critical project.

05:41.800 --> 05:45.952
Tomis, this is SG-1 of the planet Earth.

05:46.040 --> 05:48.349
My pleasure.

05:48.440 --> 05:50.510
What is this?

05:50.600 --> 05:53.637
The core of this device
was uncovered in an ancient temple

05:53.720 --> 05:56.234
of a race of people
we believe were called the Guld.

05:56.320 --> 05:58.709
- Goa'uld.
- Really?

06:00.040 --> 06:04.636
It's a mineral substance found to have
highly unstable radioactive properties.

06:04.720 --> 06:08.872
This experiment seems to indicate
the potential for great bursts of energy.

06:09.240 --> 06:11.549
Our translation of the writings indicate

06:11.640 --> 06:14.393
that the alien element
is called naquadria.

06:14.480 --> 06:16.550
Uh, naqahdah.

06:16.640 --> 06:21.395
No... We also translated
that word in the same text.

06:21.480 --> 06:23.596
This is definitely naquadria.

06:23.680 --> 06:26.558
So this is some sort of
power-generating device?

06:29.520 --> 06:31.033
Not exactly.

06:31.120 --> 06:33.395
They were making a bomb, sir.

06:33.480 --> 06:37.359
They were far from achieving
a deliverable weapon, but, if successful,

06:37.440 --> 06:40.477
it would have been as powerful
as a naqahdah-enhanced warhead.

06:40.560 --> 06:44.155
The Kelownans claimed they were
under threat from neighbouring nations,

06:44.240 --> 06:47.152
and the weapon would only be used
to ensure their freedom.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.869
It's a situation we'd have to be
careful about getting involved in.

06:50.960 --> 06:52.313
Yes, sir.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.468
I'm not sure we need to
worry about that, General.

06:55.560 --> 06:56.754
How so?

06:56.840 --> 06:59.673
I don't think they want
our help any longer.

06:59.760 --> 07:03.548
Something to do with how Dr Jackson
was exposed to that much radiation?

07:03.640 --> 07:08.634
We were touring the city. Daniel
was at the research facility with Jonas.

07:08.720 --> 07:12.838
He was pretty passionate about
trying to convince the Kelownan people

07:12.920 --> 07:15.832
that building a bomb
wasn't the answer to their problems.

07:15.920 --> 07:19.515
- Still, we don't know...
- Colonel, what do you know?

07:21.760 --> 07:26.151
Sir, they're claiming Daniel
tried to sabotage their research.

07:27.760 --> 07:30.558
They're lying, General.

07:30.640 --> 07:32.631
I also do not believe this to be true.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.598
They let us bring him back home
on compassionate grounds.

07:35.680 --> 07:39.639
But the fact is, they just didn't
want us around there any more.

07:39.720 --> 07:44.111
But they are demanding that
he be returned to face the charges,

07:44.200 --> 07:46.589
if he survives.

07:48.040 --> 07:50.190
What is Dr Jackson saying happened?

07:54.720 --> 07:57.871
The nausea will be followed
by tremors, convulsions,

07:57.960 --> 08:00.554
and something called ataxia.

08:00.640 --> 08:03.757
Surface tissue and internal organs
will inflame and degrade.

08:03.840 --> 08:06.638
I believe that's called necrosis.

08:06.720 --> 08:11.669
Based on the dose of radiation I got, that
will happen in the next ten to 15 hours.

08:12.640 --> 08:15.712
If I don't drown in my own blood
and fluids, I'll bleed to death.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.837
There is no medical treatment
to prevent that.

08:21.040 --> 08:22.996
Maybe not that we know of.

08:23.080 --> 08:27.756
We don't go running to our offworld allies
every time an individual's life's at stake.

08:27.840 --> 08:31.435
My life is no more valuable
than anybody else's.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.678
- What happened?
- It doesn't matter.

08:37.760 --> 08:39.716
Yes, it does.

08:40.880 --> 08:43.394
You didn't try to sabotage anything.

08:47.640 --> 08:49.437
There was an accident.

08:49.520 --> 08:54.435
The scientists figured they would be held
responsible. It was easier to blame me.

08:54.520 --> 08:58.069
- And you're OK with this?
- No. But there's not much I can do.

08:58.160 --> 09:00.310
Yes, there is.

09:01.760 --> 09:06.231
If they really wanna blame me,
denying it isn't gonna change anything.

09:06.320 --> 09:10.199
10,000 years ago a Goa'uld tried
the same experiments that they're trying,

09:10.280 --> 09:12.919
and he nearly blew
the entire planet to bits.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.355
I tried telling them. They wouldn't listen.

09:15.440 --> 09:20.036
They're gonna build that bomb,
and nothing we say is gonna stop them.

09:24.360 --> 09:28.148
The Asgard is still not responding.
We've tried to reach Jacob Carter,

09:28.240 --> 09:32.119
but, last we heard, he was on a mission
to recover the last undercover Tok'ra.

09:32.200 --> 09:35.670
General, we do have
intelligence on a sarcophagus.

09:35.760 --> 09:39.150
- SG-3's mission report two months ago.
- Yes, sir.

09:39.240 --> 09:41.913
We both know the negative effects
of that technology.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.551
But Daniel's been in one of those things a
dozen times. Once more isn't gonna hurt.

09:46.640 --> 09:51.839
However, SG-3's report clearly indicated
that the sarcophagus is heavily guarded,

09:52.080 --> 09:55.595
and likely retrieving it would
result in significant casualties,

09:55.680 --> 09:58.831
which is why I did not order
a recovery mission at the time.

09:58.920 --> 10:00.035
- Sir...
- Colonel,

10:00.120 --> 10:04.113
please don't think you're alone
in your feelings on this matter.

10:07.680 --> 10:08.829
Yes, sir.

10:13.280 --> 10:17.558
- Got anything?
- Well, I've been doing some calculations.

10:17.640 --> 10:20.234
- Anything to help Daniel?
- I wish.

10:21.240 --> 10:24.277
Based on the amount of radiation
they say he was exposed to,

10:24.360 --> 10:28.672
I've estimated the energy that would have
been generated by the experiment.

10:28.760 --> 10:32.878
- And?
- The potential's astronomical, sir.

10:32.960 --> 10:36.270
A very small amount of
the unstable element they're working with

10:36.360 --> 10:40.558
emitted a pulse of energy far greater
than anything I've ever believed possible -

10:40.640 --> 10:43.359
much more than weapons-grade
naqahdah would have.

10:43.440 --> 10:48.116
It would require a massive nuclear
reaction to even approach this level.

10:48.200 --> 10:49.269
So?

10:49.360 --> 10:53.592
This could be the missing link
in terms of generating the kind of energy

10:53.680 --> 10:56.877
I believe is necessary
to create a hyperspace window,

10:56.960 --> 11:01.556
or to generate the kind of shields the
Goa'uld have used to protect their ships.

11:01.640 --> 11:04.234
Sir, we have to get some of this element.

11:06.920 --> 11:11.152
Their government believes Dr Jackson
was trying to sabotage their research.

11:11.240 --> 11:15.028
It's a lie. They're using Daniel
as a scapegoat.

11:15.120 --> 11:19.432
You said he was vocal in his disapproval
of their project before the accident.

11:19.520 --> 11:21.875
None of it bodes well
for diplomatic relations.

11:21.960 --> 11:26.829
Why are you talking about diplomatic
relations? This is Daniel's life!

11:26.920 --> 11:30.549
Sir, I know how you feel
because I feel the same way.

11:30.640 --> 11:34.997
But I cannot stress enough
how valuable this element could be.

11:35.080 --> 11:37.674
I will draft a letter
to the Kelownan leaders.

11:37.760 --> 11:43.153
General, you cannot capitulate to
these people. They are lying bastards!

11:43.240 --> 11:45.435
Their government doesn't know the truth.

11:45.520 --> 11:48.273
They will have little reason to believe us,

11:48.360 --> 11:52.273
when what we're forcing them to admit
would be a major embarrassment.

11:52.360 --> 11:55.989
It will put them at too great
a disadvantage in further negotiations.

11:56.080 --> 11:57.752
Sir...

11:57.840 --> 12:00.070
you cannot admit Daniel is guilty.

12:00.160 --> 12:04.597
Give me some credit, Jack. I will tell them
that we did not order any such action,

12:04.680 --> 12:08.309
and do not condone its obvious
intentions, both of which are true.

12:08.760 --> 12:13.231
Hopefully we can lay the groundwork
for further diplomatic negotiations,

12:13.320 --> 12:17.279
which will eventually result in
an amicable trade for the naquadria.

12:17.720 --> 12:20.473
I'm ordering you to deliver the letter.

12:21.360 --> 12:23.476
Fine... sir.

12:29.280 --> 12:30.793
Hey.

12:31.800 --> 12:34.109
Colonel O'Neill.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.509
I'm surprised to see you.

12:36.600 --> 12:40.309
I brought a letter from
my superior to your leaders.

12:40.400 --> 12:41.549
Hi.

12:41.640 --> 12:44.200
That's, uh... an apology.

12:44.280 --> 12:48.558
Yeah, hardly. You see, we know
you're lying through your teeth.

12:50.480 --> 12:53.631
- How is Dr Jackson?
- Not good.

12:53.720 --> 12:55.950
I'm sorry to hear that.

12:56.040 --> 12:59.555
Two of the scientists are already dead.
The other two will be shortly.

12:59.640 --> 13:02.757
Their deaths were... horrific.

13:03.920 --> 13:07.708
My superior thinks that denying
the allegations against Daniel

13:07.800 --> 13:10.872
- Would be a waste of time.
- He's a wise man.

13:11.880 --> 13:15.873
Why is your government even trying
to maintain a relationship with us?

13:15.960 --> 13:18.918
We want some of that stuff
you're experimenting with.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.788
My government still thinks
they can negotiate for it.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.951
The naquadria is very spare
and extremely valuable to us.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.838
I doubt that my government
would ever agree to that.

13:29.920 --> 13:31.911
Yeah, I figured.

13:32.880 --> 13:36.509
- That's why I'm here.
- I don't understand.

13:36.600 --> 13:40.718
I only agreed to bring that letter
so I could see you.

13:40.800 --> 13:43.519
- Why?
- Because Daniel is dying.

13:43.600 --> 13:46.637
And you're looking
for someone to blame, or...?

13:47.640 --> 13:50.074
I'm not gonna let you tarnish his name.

13:51.080 --> 13:54.516
See, I don't care what
that stuff is worth to anyone.

13:54.600 --> 13:59.151
My government will admit
Daniel is guilty over my dead body.

13:59.560 --> 14:02.916
- What do you want from me?
- Just tell the truth.

14:04.080 --> 14:06.275
I can't.

14:07.960 --> 14:10.872
Even if I wanted to,
without the support of...

14:10.960 --> 14:14.350
We're in this mess because you
and your buddies are lying cowards,

14:14.440 --> 14:17.193
- Trying to cover your own incompetence.
- Colonel.

14:17.280 --> 14:20.033
We desperately need
the weapon we're developing.

14:20.120 --> 14:23.351
Without it, the Kelownan people
could fall to our rival nations,

14:23.440 --> 14:26.671
who are developing their own
powerful weapons as we speak.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.630
We will do whatever's necessary to
ensure our freedom and a lasting peace.

14:31.720 --> 14:33.836
All right, let me be clear about something.

14:33.920 --> 14:37.310
I think this is the point
Daniel was trying to make.

14:38.680 --> 14:43.071
A weapon of mass destruction
can only be used for one thing.

14:44.400 --> 14:48.791
You might think it'll ensure peace
and freedom, but I guarantee you,

14:48.880 --> 14:52.634
it'll never have the effect
you're hoping for until you use it,

14:52.720 --> 14:54.870
at least once.

14:57.360 --> 15:01.592
Now, just for the record,
the reason we want that stuff

15:01.680 --> 15:05.195
is because we think it could be
used to create defence shields.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.231
But you just go ahead.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.629
Blow yourselves to hell with it.

15:30.600 --> 15:33.239
He looks awful.

15:33.320 --> 15:36.915
It's gonna get a lot worse,
and it's gonna happen fast.

15:38.920 --> 15:41.957
I'm sure you're doing everything you can.

15:42.040 --> 15:45.828
Sedatives and painkillers.
That's all we can really do.

15:46.880 --> 15:50.077
You have no idea
how painful this is going to get.

15:54.240 --> 15:59.075
I'd not normally say this-it goes against
everything I've been trained to do -

15:59.160 --> 16:03.073
but the truth is,
he'd be a lot better off if I...

16:37.640 --> 16:39.437
Daniel.

16:42.560 --> 16:45.313
I didn't suggest this before because, um...

16:45.400 --> 16:49.791
Well, the truth is, I'm not really sure
what I'm doing with this thing.

16:50.200 --> 16:52.668
I could make things worse.

17:18.520 --> 17:20.954
He's seizing. Give me five of Valium.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.871
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

17:23.440 --> 17:26.079
Help me get him on his side.

17:29.840 --> 17:32.798
Valium's in.
Stand by with the Ambu bag.

17:32.880 --> 17:36.031
Draw two grams of magnesium sulphate.
Ease him back.

17:36.120 --> 17:37.519
Easy.

18:13.320 --> 18:15.675
Your fate is in your hands.

18:50.680 --> 18:52.477
Hey, Jack.

18:54.080 --> 18:55.479
Hey.

19:07.200 --> 19:08.918
l, uh...

19:10.520 --> 19:12.715
I just wanted to...

19:18.160 --> 19:20.754
I'm really bad at this.

19:20.840 --> 19:22.558
Yes, you are.

19:24.240 --> 19:26.356
I hear that Sam thinks, uh...

19:26.440 --> 19:29.193
naquadria might be
an important discovery.

19:29.280 --> 19:33.159
Yeah... apparently. If we can get some.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.195
For what it's worth, I...

19:39.200 --> 19:41.509
tried to get your point across to Jonas.

19:41.960 --> 19:43.951
He's in a tough position.

19:45.800 --> 19:50.237
You're not gonna take the fall for this.
I don't care what's at stake.

19:52.160 --> 19:54.549
Why do you care?

20:04.280 --> 20:06.635
Because despite the fact

20:06.720 --> 20:10.952
that you've been a terrific pain in the ass
for the last five years,

20:11.960 --> 20:14.190
I may have...

20:15.600 --> 20:17.716
might have, um...

20:18.520 --> 20:22.035
grown to admire you a little...

20:24.080 --> 20:25.399
I think.

20:27.440 --> 20:29.635
That's touching.

20:33.840 --> 20:37.719
This will not be
your last act on official record.

20:44.360 --> 20:45.395
Oma...

20:47.280 --> 20:48.599
What?

20:49.880 --> 20:52.075
Oma Desala.

20:55.440 --> 21:01.310
I felt like I knew you, like we had met
before, but... you look different.

21:01.720 --> 21:04.188
Lightning flashes, sparks shower.

21:04.280 --> 21:07.670
In one blink of your eyes,
you have missed seeing.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.471
Right.

21:11.560 --> 21:14.836
What did you mean when you said
my fate is in my hands?

21:15.560 --> 21:20.680
When the mind is enlightened, the spirit
is freed, and the body matters not.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.998
You're talking about ascension, right?

21:24.440 --> 21:28.035
The rising to a different
plane of existence.

21:28.120 --> 21:32.591
Are you saying that I could do that?
Become like you?

21:32.680 --> 21:35.911
You must complete the journey
you began at Kheb.

21:38.520 --> 21:42.559
Only then will you be able
to find your way to the great path.

21:42.640 --> 21:45.632
- What do I do?
- Release your burden.

21:47.920 --> 21:50.912
OK. Well, consider it released.
What's step two?

21:51.240 --> 21:53.674
A tall man cannot hide in the short grass.

21:53.760 --> 21:57.548
I really don't have time for one
of these kind of conversations.

21:57.640 --> 22:01.838
One cannot reach enlightenment
by running from death.

22:01.920 --> 22:06.232
- Tell me what to do.
- Many roads lead to the great path.

22:06.320 --> 22:08.276
Only the willing will find their way.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.794
OK. Well, I'm willing.

22:10.880 --> 22:13.792
So let's go. I mean,
you know, do your thing.

22:13.880 --> 22:16.075
Glow me.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.310
The river tells no lies,

22:18.440 --> 22:22.911
though standing on the shore,
the dishonest man still hears them.

22:25.080 --> 22:26.672
Right.

22:28.080 --> 22:30.389
I didn't think it was gonna be that easy.

23:04.400 --> 23:05.913
What are you doing here?

23:06.360 --> 23:10.069
Your commander was kind enough
to grant my passage.

23:12.600 --> 23:15.239
I brought this.

23:15.320 --> 23:17.151
Naquadria.

23:18.080 --> 23:20.389
I took as much as I could.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.072
Why?

23:24.960 --> 23:28.839
Data recorded in that accident showed
the potential power of the weapon

23:28.920 --> 23:31.354
unlike anything collected previously.

23:33.560 --> 23:38.076
I don't know what was worse, seeing
my colleagues die in that manner, or...

23:39.080 --> 23:42.038
seeing the looks of utter glee
on our leaders' faces

23:42.120 --> 23:46.159
when they were told
the potential power of this weapon.

23:47.160 --> 23:50.550
They wanted to know
when it could be "demonstrated".

23:53.760 --> 23:56.752
I told them the truth
about what happened.

24:04.480 --> 24:06.550
I read that book you gave me.

24:06.640 --> 24:09.677
Already? I just gave it to you last night.

24:09.760 --> 24:13.548
Quick study. It's how
I got this position at my age.

24:13.640 --> 24:15.631
And...?

24:15.720 --> 24:18.598
It should prove useful in the translations.

24:18.680 --> 24:20.955
I thought you'd be a little more excited.

24:21.040 --> 24:27.275
No offence. I'm just more interested in
what's out there, through the Stargate.

24:27.360 --> 24:30.272
Whatever problems there are
between your planet's nations

24:30.360 --> 24:34.831
will seem insignificant when you do
find out what's going on "out there".

24:34.920 --> 24:38.879
Until you give us more details,
there's not much else I can do.

24:38.960 --> 24:43.397
Well, you've probably seen the evidence
right here on your own planet.

24:43.480 --> 24:47.792
That temple was obviously occupied by a
powerful, technologically advanced race.

24:48.160 --> 24:50.390
As far as I can tell from your pictures,

24:50.480 --> 24:52.914
they were destroyed
by a catastrophic explosion.

24:53.000 --> 24:59.348
Our scientists theorised that an asteroid
impacted our continent 10,000 years ago.

24:59.440 --> 25:02.398
The fallout could have
easily buried the civilisation.

25:02.480 --> 25:06.553
Or the race were experimenting with
the very technology you are today.

25:06.880 --> 25:10.953
If what you say is true about the
potential enemies out there in our galaxy,

25:11.040 --> 25:13.600
we may need these advanced
weapons more than ever.

25:13.680 --> 25:17.070
I can't deny that, but some very
wise people have shown me how

25:17.160 --> 25:20.277
a sudden leap in weapons
technology by a civilisation

25:20.360 --> 25:22.635
can lead to its destruction.

25:33.040 --> 25:36.794
Given the chance,
you would deny us this technology?

25:36.880 --> 25:41.078
I can't predict what would happen
with or without the weapon. I just...

25:41.160 --> 25:43.515
wish there was another way.

25:51.480 --> 25:54.278
Energy readings are increasing
by a power of ten.

25:54.360 --> 25:56.749
Incredible.

26:07.880 --> 26:10.348
Did you see that?

26:17.520 --> 26:19.351
Get down!

26:19.440 --> 26:22.989
Stay away from the glass!
The radiation will penetrate the window!

26:23.080 --> 26:26.277
- What's happening?
- This device could explode.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.991
We have to remove the core.

26:32.600 --> 26:34.591
Tomis!

26:38.960 --> 26:40.757
Dr Jackson!

26:47.080 --> 26:49.071
No! Dr Jackson!

27:04.880 --> 27:06.871
(device humming)

27:08.840 --> 27:10.831
(humming crescendoes)

27:36.120 --> 27:38.315
I am ashamed...

27:39.320 --> 27:44.235
that they would not bring themselves
to recognise Dr Jackson's heroism.

27:45.520 --> 27:47.670
He saved millions of lives.

27:50.360 --> 27:52.920
Millions could still die.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.915
The future's never certain. You saved
many without regard for your own life.

27:58.920 --> 28:01.388
I could have destroyed the device.

28:02.920 --> 28:05.150
You believe your journey is still not over.

28:07.920 --> 28:12.596
Actually, I'm not entirely sure what
the point of my journey so far has been.

28:12.680 --> 28:15.319
If this is about being honest with yourself,

28:18.320 --> 28:21.118
I believe my entire life has been a failure.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.829
Just so you know,
Jonas had a change of heart.

28:30.440 --> 28:32.829
He stole some naquadria for us.

28:34.240 --> 28:37.949
He took a big risk. He said
it was because of what you did.

28:39.560 --> 28:43.553
I think it could be important,
and I wanted you to know that.

28:48.640 --> 28:51.518
You have an effect on people, Daniel.

28:52.280 --> 28:54.714
The way you look at things...

28:55.720 --> 28:57.915
It changed me too.

29:04.560 --> 29:06.312
I...

29:06.400 --> 29:08.709
I see what really matters.

29:10.920 --> 29:14.708
I don't know why we wait
to tell people how we really feel.

29:16.720 --> 29:19.712
I guess I hoped that you always knew.

29:30.080 --> 29:34.471
You can never reach enlightenment
if you do not believe you are worthy.

29:37.080 --> 29:39.469
Then I guess we may have a problem.

30:03.920 --> 30:06.150
You once gave me this.

30:07.360 --> 30:11.956
You said that its spirit would
one day serve its owner in the afterlife.

30:16.960 --> 30:22.034
Thanks. I'm not dead yet, but...
I guess it doesn't look so good right now.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.236
If you are to die, Daniel Jackson,

30:24.320 --> 30:28.757
I wish you to know that I believe
that the fight against the Goa'uld

30:28.840 --> 30:31.991
will have lost one of its greatest warriors.

30:35.160 --> 30:38.357
And I will have lost
one of my greatest friends.

30:44.120 --> 30:47.715
Because it is so clear,
it takes a long time to realise it.

30:47.800 --> 30:50.678
If you immediately know
the candlelight is fire,

30:50.760 --> 30:53.149
the meal was cooked a long time ago.

30:54.800 --> 30:59.271
The monk at Kheb said that to me. I don't
know what it meant then, and I still don't.

30:59.360 --> 31:01.954
Why do you feel you have
failed on your journey?

31:02.040 --> 31:04.429
You've opened the Stargate
for your world.

31:04.520 --> 31:07.432
I cracked a code.
A lot of other people made it work.

31:07.520 --> 31:11.911
The very next thing you did was
help free the people of Abydos from evil.

31:16.560 --> 31:17.959
Sha're!

31:19.240 --> 31:21.993
I had the chance
to live out my life with her.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.434
I couldn't leave it alone.

31:26.440 --> 31:30.718
I was the one that unburied the gate.
What happened to her was my fault.

31:34.520 --> 31:37.717
I couldn't save Sha're,
I couldn't save Sarah.

31:38.720 --> 31:42.395
Every Goa'uld I helped eliminate,
another one took its place.

31:42.480 --> 31:46.792
Maybe I did some good, but nothing I've
done seems to have changed anything.

31:46.880 --> 31:49.952
These tasks of which you speak
were great challenges,

31:50.040 --> 31:54.556
- Perhaps even impossible to achieve.
- Does that absolve me?

31:54.640 --> 31:58.952
You feel your journey must continue
until you have found redemption?

31:59.040 --> 32:01.429
No. Not any more. Not if I'm dead.

32:07.480 --> 32:09.152
Exactly true.

32:13.800 --> 32:16.872
You said I was the only one
qualified to judge myself.

32:16.960 --> 32:21.112
So no matter how much I want to achieve
enlightenment, or whatever you call it,

32:21.200 --> 32:25.990
what happens if I look at my life
and I don't honestly believe I deserve it?

32:26.080 --> 32:30.710
The success or failure of your deeds
does not add up to the sum of your life.

32:32.560 --> 32:37.270
Your spirit cannot be weighed. Judge
yourself by the intention of your actions,

32:37.360 --> 32:42.798
and by the strength with which you faced
challenges that have stood in your way.

32:42.880 --> 32:44.074
And what if I can't?

32:44.160 --> 32:48.073
People close to you have been trying to
tell you that you have made a difference.

32:48.160 --> 32:51.357
That you did change things for the better.

32:52.400 --> 32:54.470
Not enough.

32:54.560 --> 32:58.951
The universe is vast, and we are so small.

32:59.520 --> 33:03.433
There is really only one thing
we can ever truly control.

33:03.520 --> 33:06.193
What's that?

33:06.280 --> 33:08.919
Whether we are good or evil.

33:21.760 --> 33:24.638
Obviously they don't know that I'm here.

33:24.720 --> 33:28.110
I was lucky enough
to be able to access our Stargate.

33:29.920 --> 33:34.277
If I'm caught returning to my planet,
I will be considered a traitor.

33:35.280 --> 33:38.636
- What do you want?
- I don't believe my people will support

33:38.720 --> 33:41.871
a war that leads to
any kind of mass destruction.

33:41.960 --> 33:45.953
Our leaders just don't see
any viable alternative right now.

33:46.440 --> 33:50.672
Promise me, if you're able
to develop defence technologies

33:50.760 --> 33:55.629
such as these shields that you spoke of,
you'll share them with my government.

33:55.720 --> 33:58.792
- Of course.
- Unauthorised incoming wormhole.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.797
Wait here.

34:06.640 --> 34:10.315
- Receiving Tok'ra IDC, sir.
- All defence teams on high alert.

34:10.400 --> 34:12.994
High alert. Repeat, high alert.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.195
Open the iris.

34:33.520 --> 34:35.795
(Hammond) Stand down.

34:42.360 --> 34:45.670
Sorry, Jacob. Given what's
been happening with the Tok'ra,

34:45.760 --> 34:48.717
- We had to be sure it was you.
- Understood. What's going on?

34:48.800 --> 34:50.518
It's Daniel.

34:55.920 --> 34:57.876
Hey, Sam.

34:57.960 --> 35:00.155
I'm so sorry.

35:01.160 --> 35:03.799
I tried this, but it didn't work.

35:03.880 --> 35:05.950
We'll do our best.

35:19.120 --> 35:22.829
(distorted) His condition is grave.
I do not know if I can save him.

35:23.440 --> 35:27.558
And even if I can, I do not believe
I can restore his full healthy state.

35:30.120 --> 35:32.270
Do what you can.

35:36.680 --> 35:39.638
You're leaving?
You can't... you can't leave.

35:41.040 --> 35:43.395
The rest is up to you.

35:43.480 --> 35:46.677
Why... why me?
Why... why give me this chance?

35:47.240 --> 35:49.390
Anyone can reach enlightenment -

35:49.480 --> 35:53.519
anyone prepared to open their mind
as you did when you first came to Kheb.

35:55.640 --> 35:57.915
They're trying to save me.

35:59.120 --> 36:01.190
They're healing me. I can feel it.

36:01.280 --> 36:03.669
Then your journey will continue as before.

36:03.760 --> 36:06.672
What if I don't want it to?

36:06.760 --> 36:07.954
Not that way.

36:08.040 --> 36:11.828
Walking the great path
brings great responsibility.

36:11.920 --> 36:15.549
You cannot fear it,
nor hesitate in your resolve.

36:18.800 --> 36:20.995
I understand.

36:24.480 --> 36:27.995
- I'm ready to go with you.
- Then stop them.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.033
How?

37:09.800 --> 37:11.995
- Daniel.
- Yeah.

37:18.320 --> 37:20.629
- Did you want something?
- Yeah.

37:20.720 --> 37:23.757
- Tell Jacob to stop.
- Why?

37:23.840 --> 37:26.559
Because I'm ready to move on.

37:27.560 --> 37:30.393
- You're just giving up?
- No.

37:30.480 --> 37:33.074
No, I'm not giving up, believe me.

37:54.600 --> 37:56.875
You remember Oma?

37:58.720 --> 38:00.676
Sure.

38:02.760 --> 38:05.149
I think I can do more this way.

38:08.640 --> 38:10.596
It's what I want.

38:13.560 --> 38:16.154
I have to go now.

38:16.240 --> 38:18.629
Everything's gonna be fine.

38:20.400 --> 38:22.630
Please, Jack.

38:23.640 --> 38:26.074
Tell Jacob to stop.

38:31.520 --> 38:33.715
Jacob.

38:34.160 --> 38:35.957
Stop.

38:37.040 --> 38:40.635
- Are you serious?
- It's what he wants.

38:50.440 --> 38:53.238
Is someone else
gonna tell me what to do?

38:55.960 --> 38:58.349
Just let him go.

39:17.040 --> 39:18.234
Colonel?

39:46.280 --> 39:47.998
I'm gonna miss you guys.

39:48.480 --> 39:50.038
Yeah...

39:51.040 --> 39:52.632
You too.

39:54.360 --> 39:56.555
Thank you.

39:58.080 --> 40:00.514
For everything.

40:03.520 --> 40:05.112
So...

40:06.880 --> 40:09.838
What? See you around?

40:13.480 --> 40:15.072
I don't know.

40:23.440 --> 40:25.237
(O'Neill) Hey.

40:26.960 --> 40:29.110
Where are you going?

40:29.200 --> 40:30.633
I don't know.
