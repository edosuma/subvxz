00:41.476 --> 00:45.610
<i>Welcome to Boston for
the 2017 AFC Championship game</i>

00:45.784 --> 00:49.049
<i>between the New England Patriots
and the Pittsburgh Steelers.</i>

00:49.223 --> 00:50.702
<i>New England wins the toss</i>

00:50.876 --> 00:52.878
<i>here at Gillette Stadium
in Foxborough, Massachusetts.</i>

00:53.053 --> 00:55.055
Game'’s about to start!

00:55.229 --> 00:57.709
<i>These two teams
fighting for the right
to play down in Houston.</i>

00:57.883 --> 01:01.496
Hey, game'’s about to start.
Everyone to your spots.

01:01.670 --> 01:04.151
I got my tea.
Somebody get the guacamole.

01:04.325 --> 01:06.066
- We didn'’t make guacamole.
- Chips with no guac!

01:06.240 --> 01:08.677
I can'’t believe
- we have to do this.
- It'’s our tradition.

01:08.851 --> 01:10.722
Trish, you'’re in
the dining room.
Get the magazine.

01:10.896 --> 01:12.072
You were reading the magazine.

01:12.246 --> 01:13.812
I can'’t see from in here!

01:13.986 --> 01:15.162
- There you go.
- Yeah. Oh, thanks.

01:15.336 --> 01:16.815
- I'’m going to my chair.
- Betty!

01:16.989 --> 01:18.252
What?
I'’m standing next to it.

01:18.426 --> 01:20.167
Just get on the ladder.

01:20.341 --> 01:21.994
- Get up on the ladder!
- All right! Here I am.

01:22.169 --> 01:22.952
Ladder!

01:23.126 --> 01:24.171
I'’m on the ladder.

01:24.345 --> 01:26.042
I think
it'’s a fun tradition.

01:26.216 --> 01:28.044
Yeah, '’cause you'’re sitting
on the couch, drinking tea.

01:28.218 --> 01:30.090
Yeah, sipping.
Drinking is vulgar.
I sip.

01:30.264 --> 01:31.743
Lou, I have to tell you,

01:31.917 --> 01:33.528
this really doesn'’t affect
the outcome of the game.

01:33.702 --> 01:35.182
It'’s just a silly superstition.

01:35.356 --> 01:36.879
Well, what happened
in week eight?

01:37.053 --> 01:39.142
Well, I was standing
on the ladder
fixing a lightbulb

01:39.316 --> 01:40.883
that was flickering
and driving me crazy.

01:41.057 --> 01:43.538
Exactly. You were up
on the ladder at kickoff.

01:43.712 --> 01:46.236
Trish was in the dining room
reading her magazine,

01:46.410 --> 01:47.977
Maura was drinking tea--Sipping.

01:48.151 --> 01:50.240
And I spilled the chips.
And what happened?

01:50.414 --> 01:51.589
We beat the Bills.

01:51.763 --> 01:53.417
We killed the Bills.

01:53.591 --> 01:55.027
We killed the Bills.

01:55.202 --> 01:56.464
Why chance it?
She'’s got a point.

01:56.638 --> 01:58.248
Oh! There'’s Tom.

01:58.422 --> 02:00.207
[Lou] Oh,
what a beautiful man.

02:00.381 --> 02:01.730
Gorgeous.[Maura] Oh, my goodness.

02:01.904 --> 02:02.861
He'’s so well-hydrated.

02:04.472 --> 02:06.691
I prefer Gronkowski
these days.

02:06.865 --> 02:09.172
We know, Trish.
We'’ve all read
your Gronk erotica.

02:09.346 --> 02:10.565
It'’s not erotica.

02:10.739 --> 02:12.567
It'’s fan fiction.

02:12.741 --> 02:14.351
Very sexy fan fiction.

02:14.525 --> 02:15.700
No kidding.

02:15.874 --> 02:16.745
Oh, my God!

02:16.919 --> 02:18.181
Oh! Get her a new tea!

02:18.355 --> 02:20.009
- I was distracted.
- Trish, get her a new tea!

02:20.183 --> 02:21.532
- Sorry, guys!
- It'’s almost kickoff!

02:21.706 --> 02:23.926
- It'’s not hot!
- Just use the faucet!

02:24.100 --> 02:25.884
I-I prefer it hot. Okay?

02:26.058 --> 02:28.409
- Maura, I'’ve got your tea.
- Lou! The chips!

02:28.583 --> 02:30.062
- Oh, shit, the chips!
- Kickoff in two, one--

02:30.237 --> 02:31.151
<i>It'’s kickoff!</i>

02:34.545 --> 02:37.461
Well--Oh, nice work!

02:43.511 --> 02:45.426
<i>Touchback.
Tom Brady comes out.</i>

02:45.600 --> 02:49.212
<i>Once again,
33rd postseason appearance.</i>

02:50.170 --> 02:51.606
<i>The hold by Ryan Allen.</i>

02:52.781 --> 02:54.870
<i>Cardona snaps it back.
The kick is good.</i>

02:55.044 --> 02:56.698
- All right! Okay!
- Brady completes.

02:56.872 --> 02:58.569
All right. Okay.
- We'’re on the board.
- That'’s good.

03:04.662 --> 03:07.143
Third and long!
This is our song!

03:07.317 --> 03:09.885
Third and long!
This is our song!

03:10.059 --> 03:11.495
Yes!

03:19.938 --> 03:22.985
<i>♪ We'’ve got it all
In store for you♪</i>

03:23.159 --> 03:26.380
<i>♪ From the Berkshires
To the shore♪</i>

03:26.554 --> 03:29.774
<i>♪ Mayflower Auto Mart and more ♪</i>

03:29.948 --> 03:31.211
Oh, man!

03:31.385 --> 03:33.387
She'’s new. She is pretty.

03:33.561 --> 03:35.650
Oh, she'’s just
a knockoff of you.

03:35.824 --> 03:37.826
You'’re the original
Mayflower Girl.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.307
You'’re just as beautiful now
as you were back then.

03:40.481 --> 03:41.960
- Oh, God. Thank you.
- Yes.

03:42.134 --> 03:44.136
You know what it cost me
to look like this?

03:44.311 --> 03:45.268
A fortune.

03:50.882 --> 03:51.883
- Give '’em the curse.
- Okay.

03:54.538 --> 03:55.800
Hands!

03:55.974 --> 03:57.498
- <i>Third and goal.
- Breath!</i>

03:57.672 --> 03:59.108
<i>A hike to the 19...</i>

04:08.073 --> 04:09.858
Okay, a toast.

04:10.032 --> 04:12.861
To the man who brought us
all here: Tom Brady.

04:14.210 --> 04:17.692
Who never gives up,
no matter what he'’s up against.

04:17.866 --> 04:22.653
May the hand of fate
continue to bless him
with perfect spirals

04:22.827 --> 04:26.178
and the confidence
to stand tall in the pocket.

04:27.441 --> 04:28.964
- To Tom.
- To Tom!

04:29.138 --> 04:31.183
- To Tom.
- To Tom.

04:31.358 --> 04:34.883
To Tom!
And to our quarterback,

04:35.057 --> 04:36.319
the woman
who brought us together

04:36.493 --> 04:37.668
and made this our tradition.

04:37.842 --> 04:39.453
No, I didn'’t plan
on all this.

04:47.722 --> 04:48.984
Here we go.
This is it.

04:49.158 --> 04:52.901
Five, four, three, two, one,

04:53.075 --> 04:56.339
Tom Brady!

04:58.036 --> 05:00.212
We'’re going
- to the Super Bowl!
- Good job.

05:00.387 --> 05:02.780
We did it![sighs] Oh, boy.

05:04.216 --> 05:06.871
So, I suppose

05:07.045 --> 05:10.701
that gives us two weeks
to plan the Super Bowl party.

05:10.875 --> 05:12.747
Shall we all
- bring appetizers?
- Why not?

05:12.921 --> 05:14.052
Can I bring Carl?

05:14.226 --> 05:15.619
You know,
things are getting serious.

05:15.793 --> 05:17.839
Who is he again?[Betty] The handsome one.

05:18.013 --> 05:18.970
They'’re all handsome.

05:19.144 --> 05:20.972
What if we went?

05:21.146 --> 05:24.106
Oh, Trish,
you fall in love faster
than any other human on Earth.

05:24.280 --> 05:26.891
Well, we can'’t all be
with the same man
for 50 years, Betty.

05:27.065 --> 05:28.153
Fifty-one.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.720
Let'’s all go
to the Super Bowl.

05:29.894 --> 05:32.419
Oh, no, Lou,
we'’ve looked into this.

05:32.593 --> 05:34.029
We-- We can'’t afford it.

05:34.203 --> 05:37.772
No, the tickets, the hotels,
it'’s too expensive.

05:37.946 --> 05:40.122
Two years ago,
I could'’ve paid
for us all to go.

05:40.296 --> 05:43.560
But I divorced Ralph
two weeks before the playoffs.[Betty] Oh, geez.

05:43.734 --> 05:45.214
Boy, do I regret that.

05:45.388 --> 05:46.998
- The divorce?
- No, he was terrible.

05:47.172 --> 05:49.131
But the game was amazing.

05:50.611 --> 05:51.829
Maura!

05:52.003 --> 05:53.570
Oh, Maura.

05:54.789 --> 05:56.878
Oh, I'’m sorry.
I'’m sorry.

05:57.052 --> 05:59.228
It'’s just that every time
I hear that word "divorce,"

05:59.402 --> 06:01.535
I just think of Francisco.
You know?

06:01.709 --> 06:02.927
Oh, Maura. No, no.

06:03.101 --> 06:04.973
Your husband
didn'’t divorce you.

06:05.147 --> 06:06.235
He died.

06:06.409 --> 06:07.758
It'’s the same thing.

06:07.932 --> 06:10.674
I'’m serious.
Let'’s go to the Super Bowl.

06:10.848 --> 06:12.981
The Super Bowl is no place
for four old women.

06:13.155 --> 06:14.939
This could be Tom'’s last one.

06:15.113 --> 06:16.288
He'’s almost 40.

06:16.463 --> 06:18.290
That'’s like 80 in people years.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.989
Yeah, we'’re 80
- in people years.
- Exactly!

06:21.163 --> 06:23.557
If Tom Brady can make it
to the Super Bowl,

06:23.731 --> 06:25.385
so can we.

06:25.559 --> 06:27.865
I'’d like to clarify,
I'’m not in my 80s.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.171
Neither am I.

06:29.345 --> 06:30.868
<i>...on this
momentous occasion.</i>

06:31.042 --> 06:32.957
<i>We are gonna do
something insane
for our Pats Nation.</i>

06:33.131 --> 06:36.091
Oh, it'’s Nat and Pat.
I love those guys.[Pat] <i>That'’s right.</i>

06:36.265 --> 06:38.920
<i>We'’re gonna have
a Super Bowl ticket giveaway. Aw, baby!</i>

06:39.094 --> 06:42.880
<i>Our four lucky fans
will get to travel
down to Houston</i>

06:43.054 --> 06:46.318
<i>to see the Pats
take on the Falcons.</i>

06:46.493 --> 06:48.712
<i>Just call the hotline. Call the hotline,
leave us a message.</i>

06:48.886 --> 06:50.322
<i>Tell us your story.</i>

06:50.497 --> 06:51.715
<i>Explain to us why
you deserve those tickets</i>

06:51.889 --> 06:53.282
<i>better than anybody else. Yeah.</i>

06:53.456 --> 06:54.675
<i>And we'’re gonna announce
the winner</i>

06:54.849 --> 06:56.198
<i>to our listeners
at the Super Bowl.</i>

06:56.372 --> 06:58.156
- That'’s how we go!
- It'’s a numbers game.

06:58.330 --> 06:59.549
<i>This is not a numbers game.</i>

06:59.723 --> 07:01.029
<i>So don'’t leave us
a thousand messages.</i>

07:01.203 --> 07:02.334
<i>We don'’t want '’em. Please!</i>

07:02.509 --> 07:04.336
<i>We just wanna hear
your story.</i>

07:04.511 --> 07:05.947
<i>And who knows?</i>

07:06.121 --> 07:09.167
<i>Maybe we'’ll see you
in Houston! Houston!</i>

07:10.212 --> 07:13.258
See? He said
the best story wins.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.043
We'’ve got a great story.

07:15.217 --> 07:17.741
We'’re the biggest
Pats fans there are.

07:17.915 --> 07:19.613
We love Tom Brady.

07:19.787 --> 07:22.093
And we'’re all
over 80 years old!

07:22.267 --> 07:23.443
I'’m 75.

07:23.617 --> 07:27.055
So, let'’s experience
a Super Bowl.

07:27.229 --> 07:29.710
Because this might be
our last chance.

07:29.884 --> 07:32.539
- God, that'’s morbid.
- Well, we gotta work
with what we got.

07:32.713 --> 07:34.715
We'’re gonna do this.
Bring it in.

07:34.889 --> 07:36.107
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Bring it, bring it.

07:36.281 --> 07:37.457
- Yes. Oh, yes.
- Yeah, I'’m in.

07:37.631 --> 07:38.719
Super Bowl on three.

07:38.893 --> 07:42.853
One, two, three.
Super Bowl!

07:43.027 --> 07:45.987
Hello, my name is Betty--
Elizabeth Bachman.

07:46.161 --> 07:49.077
Look, I crunched the numbers
and based on your viewership,

07:49.251 --> 07:54.256
my friends and I have
about a .00013% chance here.

07:54.430 --> 07:56.911
So, I realize that
the probability

07:57.085 --> 08:00.131
of me winning this contest
is very, very low...[Betty'’s husband] Honey!

08:01.611 --> 08:05.833
...but I used to be a professor
of applied mathematics at MIT,

08:06.007 --> 08:08.749
back when there were
only two other women
in the whole department,

08:08.923 --> 08:11.534
so I'’m used to
the odds being against me.

08:11.708 --> 08:13.231
Honey?
I have to run to class.

08:13.405 --> 08:14.711
Have you seen my watch?

08:14.885 --> 08:16.539
It'’s on the mantel
over the fireplace.

08:16.713 --> 08:17.888
You'’re also gonna need pants.

08:18.062 --> 08:19.542
Pants? Oh.

08:19.716 --> 08:22.153
Right.
What would I do without you?

08:22.327 --> 08:23.459
I just really need
this trip.

08:24.939 --> 08:26.244
Thank you very much.

08:27.898 --> 08:30.379
Oh. What do you think
of my-- my paper?

08:30.553 --> 08:32.860
I'’m gonna submit it
to the journal.

08:34.557 --> 08:37.342
Look, I love
your principal points, I do,

08:37.517 --> 08:39.910
but the whole paper right now
is rather confusing.

08:40.084 --> 08:42.086
And you can'’t expect
people to understand

08:42.260 --> 08:45.525
unless you weave
the concepts together
a bit better and--

08:45.699 --> 08:46.830
Pants.

08:47.004 --> 08:48.397
Yep, pants. Right.

08:48.571 --> 08:50.921
Hi. My name is Maura,

08:51.095 --> 08:54.011
and my friends and I
are die-hard Pats fans.

08:54.185 --> 08:57.319
Which wasn'’t always the case
growing up in Oregon,

08:57.493 --> 08:59.843
where my mother
was a lumberjack--That'’s great,

09:00.017 --> 09:01.453
but if we want
the advantage here,

09:01.628 --> 09:03.281
it has to sound like
a real story.

09:03.455 --> 09:06.458
So let'’s keep it believable.
Right?

09:06.633 --> 09:08.504
- All right. Sure, Maura.
- Okay.

09:08.678 --> 09:10.201
But she really was
a lumberjack.

09:10.375 --> 09:12.334
Being bullied in
elementary school was hard.

09:12.508 --> 09:14.684
And then when
middle school came,
things got much worse.

09:14.858 --> 09:16.294
Much, much worse.

09:16.468 --> 09:19.559
And my mom started
picking on me too--Uh-- Uh--

09:19.733 --> 09:21.299
Don'’t make it so sad.

09:21.473 --> 09:24.955
It'’s about the best story wins,
not the saddest story.

09:25.129 --> 09:26.174
Okay?

09:27.088 --> 09:28.089
Thank you.

09:28.263 --> 09:29.220
Hello?

09:29.394 --> 09:31.919
Yes.
Uh, my name is Maura,

09:32.093 --> 09:35.400
and my three friends
and I are dying.
Thank you.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.620
Okay. Bye-bye.

09:37.794 --> 09:40.188
We'’re-- We'’re dying
to go to the Super Bowl.

09:40.971 --> 09:42.669
- Oh, right.
- Yeah.

09:42.843 --> 09:44.714
- Oopsie.
- Mmm.

09:44.888 --> 09:45.846
Yeah.

09:46.455 --> 09:47.891
Hey, Maura.

09:48.065 --> 09:49.806
Thank you for including me
in all of this.

09:49.980 --> 09:51.068
This is a lot of fun.

09:51.242 --> 09:52.853
Oh, good.

09:53.027 --> 09:55.682
Hey, do you think
you could round up
some more residents?

09:55.856 --> 09:59.729
Because some of
these performances
aren'’t helping our odds.

09:59.903 --> 10:01.035
You got it.

10:01.209 --> 10:02.863
Thanks, Mick.

10:03.037 --> 10:04.821
<i>I mean, this guy
is like Caesar. No, he'’s perfect.</i>

10:04.995 --> 10:06.431
<i>And he'’s like Genghis Khan.</i>

10:06.606 --> 10:09.783
"My friends and I
are die-hard"-- No, no.

10:09.957 --> 10:15.179
"My best friends and I
are die-hard Pats fans.

10:15.353 --> 10:19.183
We'’re all ladies over 80
who love Tom Brady.

10:22.404 --> 10:25.102
Twenty years ago,
we didn'’t know anything"--

10:25.276 --> 10:26.321
No, no, no.

10:27.061 --> 10:29.454
"It was 16 years ago.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.153
<i>I'’d just finished
my last round of chemo,</i>

10:32.327 --> 10:35.678
<i>and my three best friends
had come over to cheer me up."</i>

10:35.852 --> 10:37.245
How about some TV?

10:37.419 --> 10:38.550
Mmm.

10:41.466 --> 10:43.033
<i>So third down and ten now.</i>

10:43.207 --> 10:45.557
<i>Big play for the Patriots.</i> I can'’t change the channels.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.995
Oh, I can do it.

10:50.998 --> 10:52.303
Yeah, it'’s not working.

10:52.477 --> 10:54.436
Remote'’s been acting funny.

10:54.610 --> 10:55.567
I got it.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.004
<i>Shaun Ellis, 92...</i>

10:57.178 --> 10:58.266
<i>...was carrying...</i> Oh!

10:58.440 --> 10:59.528
What do I do?
What do I do?

10:59.702 --> 11:01.922
- Don'’t hit it.
- I already hit it.

11:02.096 --> 11:03.010
Unplug it.

11:03.184 --> 11:04.141
Hold on.

11:04.315 --> 11:05.360
<i>Two minutes left in this game.</i>

11:05.534 --> 11:07.188
<i>Drew Bledsoe is out.</i>

11:07.362 --> 11:09.233
<i>They'’re gonna have to go
with their backup QB.</i>

11:09.407 --> 11:12.280
<i>Tom Brady, the second-year
quarterback from
the University of Michigan.</i>

11:12.454 --> 11:13.890
Who'’s that?

11:14.064 --> 11:16.110
<i>I think anybody could tell
by looking at Bledsoe...</i>

11:16.284 --> 11:17.459
He is cute.

11:17.633 --> 11:18.808
Oh, I'’ll watch this.

11:20.636 --> 11:22.072
I can turn myself down.

11:23.944 --> 11:26.424
<i>"Maybe it was luck,
maybe it was destiny,</i>

11:26.598 --> 11:28.383
<i>but at that moment,</i>

11:28.557 --> 11:32.256
<i>the Patriots'’
backup quarterback
got called off the bench."</i>

11:32.430 --> 11:34.171
<i>I think
that has to be so difficult.</i>

11:34.345 --> 11:35.782
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

11:35.956 --> 11:37.392
<i>"We eventually
got the remote working,</i>

11:37.566 --> 11:39.916
<i>and one week of football
became two."</i>

11:40.090 --> 11:43.659
You know, for a game
where a bunch of guys
just smash into each other,

11:43.833 --> 11:45.139
it'’s really very complicated.

11:45.313 --> 11:46.575
There are so many patterns,

11:46.749 --> 11:48.403
and if you analyze the data,
you will find--

11:48.577 --> 11:50.710
We'’re just starting
to enjoy it, Betty.

11:50.884 --> 11:52.189
Don'’t make it about math.

11:52.363 --> 11:53.408
Oh. Okay.

11:54.539 --> 11:56.498
<i>"And two weeks
became a season."</i>

12:00.545 --> 12:03.810
<i>"Tom and the Patriots
went on to win
the Super Bowl that year.</i>

12:03.984 --> 12:06.987
<i>And I, well, I'’m still here,
thanks to my team."</i>

12:07.161 --> 12:09.946
And to Lou,
our quarterback.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.687
You didn'’t!

12:11.861 --> 12:14.864
<i>"And just like that,
we had a new tradition.</i>

12:15.038 --> 12:18.694
<i>That'’s why
it would mean the world to us
to win these tickets."</i>

12:18.868 --> 12:20.478
<i>What are we talking about?</i>

12:20.652 --> 12:22.132
<i>All right, Pat.
Look, I'’m glad you asked.</i>

12:22.306 --> 12:24.526
<i>Tonight is the end
of our ticket giveaway,</i>

12:24.700 --> 12:27.094
<i>and we have received
a record number of submissions.</i>

12:27.268 --> 12:29.444
<i>But, hey, look, you still got
as about a good a chance</i>

12:29.618 --> 12:31.968
<i>as being the 199th draft pick</i>

12:32.142 --> 12:33.622
<i>and going on to become</i>

12:33.796 --> 12:36.103
<i>the four-time, soon to be
five-time, Super Bowl champ.</i>

12:36.277 --> 12:37.887
<i>We need one
for the thumb here.</i>

12:38.061 --> 12:40.020
<i>Or you could still try
and buy your tickets online,</i>

12:40.194 --> 12:41.891
<i>but for four tickets,
you'’d have to sell your car.</i>

12:42.065 --> 12:43.675
<i>Well, not your car. Yeah.</i>

12:43.850 --> 12:45.373
<i>My car'’s garbage.</i> My--

12:45.547 --> 12:46.940
<i>In your case...</i>

12:47.114 --> 12:49.203
"My best friends and I
are die-hard Pa"--

12:49.377 --> 12:51.248
This isn'’t gonna work.

12:52.336 --> 12:54.599
Oh, what do I do, Tom?

13:01.563 --> 13:02.782
What do I do?

13:06.742 --> 13:08.222
Let'’s go.

13:19.363 --> 13:21.322
<i>CarMax of Andover,
how can I help you?</i>

13:21.496 --> 13:23.324
Lou, what'’s going on?

13:23.498 --> 13:25.065
You'’re acting very strange, Lou.

13:25.239 --> 13:26.544
Just keep your eyes shut.

13:26.718 --> 13:28.851
Lou, I'’ve got to
get home before dinner.

13:29.025 --> 13:30.505
It'’s craps night.

13:30.679 --> 13:32.028
You'’ve got
your own house, Maura.

13:32.202 --> 13:34.030
Why are you still living
in a retirement center?

13:34.204 --> 13:35.815
Frank loved it very much.

13:36.598 --> 13:37.947
Okay, look.

13:38.121 --> 13:42.299
Oh! I love presents.
I love presents.

13:42.473 --> 13:43.474
- Whoo!
- Oh!

13:43.648 --> 13:45.128
Oh, my gosh.
What is happening?

13:45.302 --> 13:47.565
I wanted it to be a surprise,

13:47.739 --> 13:50.177
but all they had
were gender reveal boxes.

13:50.351 --> 13:51.482
Who'’s having a baby?

13:51.656 --> 13:53.180
No one.

13:53.354 --> 13:56.183
It'’s not a gender reveal.
It'’s just a reveal.

13:56.357 --> 13:57.184
Of what?

14:00.013 --> 14:02.015
We won the tickets.
We'’re going to the Super Bowl.

14:02.189 --> 14:04.104
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!
These are tickets.

14:04.278 --> 14:05.932
How did that happen?
How did that happen?

14:06.106 --> 14:08.978
Teamwork. I just did
what Tommy would do.

14:09.152 --> 14:12.155
Who cares how it happened?
We'’re going to the Super Bowl!

14:12.329 --> 14:13.678
Oh, my God![Betty] Oh, my God!

14:15.158 --> 14:16.899
<i>Welcome back to</i> Pats Nation.

14:17.073 --> 14:19.336
<i>The Super Bowl
is only three days away,</i>

14:19.510 --> 14:22.557
<i>and I am more excited
about this than my own wedding.</i>

14:22.731 --> 14:25.255
<i>I'’m much more excited about it
than I was about your wedding.</i>

14:26.822 --> 14:29.433
No, Carl.
I did not agree that
we could see other people.

14:29.607 --> 14:31.131
That'’s not dating.

14:31.305 --> 14:33.873
That'’s cheating,
and I'’m done talking about it.

14:34.961 --> 14:37.093
I do not want to talk to you.

14:38.399 --> 14:41.576
I'’m not interested
in anything you have to say.

14:41.750 --> 14:44.100
Wow, this chapter
is really good.

14:44.274 --> 14:45.493
Oh, it'’s so steamy.

14:45.667 --> 14:47.147
No, it'’s not finished.

14:48.104 --> 14:50.324
No. Not you, Carl.

14:51.064 --> 14:53.196
With you, it is finished.

14:54.284 --> 14:56.678
Oh, Lou, I need a hug.

14:56.852 --> 14:58.419
I need a hug.

15:01.074 --> 15:02.249
Oh, baby.

15:02.423 --> 15:04.207
You'’re too good
for that one anyway.

15:04.381 --> 15:06.731
Oh, God. I'’m just...

15:11.084 --> 15:13.216
Betty'’s right. I-I'’m--

15:13.390 --> 15:15.088
I have to stop
falling in love.

15:15.262 --> 15:18.091
No. You can fall in love.

15:18.265 --> 15:21.311
Just maybe wait till
you'’ve known them
more than a week.

15:23.531 --> 15:25.011
Maybe I just stay home.

15:25.185 --> 15:26.490
And mope around? No.

15:26.664 --> 15:28.492
We'’re going to the Super Bowl

15:28.666 --> 15:31.017
to enjoy men
the way the Romans did:

15:31.191 --> 15:34.368
sweaty,
piled on top of one another.

15:34.542 --> 15:35.760
Tight pants.

15:36.979 --> 15:39.155
Okay.

15:40.940 --> 15:44.117
So this one'’s
for your blood pressure.
It says take twice a day.

15:44.291 --> 15:46.032
And this one'’s for you
to go to sleep,

15:46.206 --> 15:49.209
so it'’s very important
you only take it
before bed, all right?

15:50.471 --> 15:52.125
I-- I'’m sorry. What?

15:52.299 --> 15:54.736
This one is for
your blood pressure.

15:54.910 --> 15:56.564
Twice a day, okay?

15:56.738 --> 15:58.566
And this one
is to help you sleep.

15:58.740 --> 16:00.742
It'’s important
to take sleep seriously.

16:00.916 --> 16:04.006
But only take it
when you'’re ready for bed,
okay? Because...

16:04.180 --> 16:06.313
All right, let me know
if you need anything else.

16:13.842 --> 16:17.019
Oh, before you leave,
have you finished
making the corrections?

16:17.193 --> 16:20.283
Honey, you really need
to take another pass at it.

16:20.457 --> 16:23.069
I mean, you need to
add your own voice.

16:23.243 --> 16:25.332
Well, you know my voice
better than I do.

16:25.506 --> 16:27.508
No, no, no. I don'’t.
I never did.

16:28.726 --> 16:30.119
- Listen to me.
- Okay.

16:30.293 --> 16:31.773
You can do it.

16:32.687 --> 16:33.949
Okay. I think so.

16:34.123 --> 16:35.124
Okay.

16:38.736 --> 16:40.216
Mind if I come in?

16:40.956 --> 16:42.479
I see your bags are packed.

16:44.307 --> 16:45.613
So where you headed?

16:46.353 --> 16:48.094
Super Bowl.

16:48.268 --> 16:49.965
- Super Bowl. Really?
- Yeah.

16:50.139 --> 16:51.314
- No, you'’re kidding?
- Mm-mmm.

16:51.488 --> 16:52.533
Oh, man.

16:52.707 --> 16:53.969
You know,
I used to play football.

16:54.143 --> 16:55.101
- High school. Yeah.
- Mmm?

16:55.275 --> 16:56.363
I was a wingback.

16:56.537 --> 16:58.017
A little undersized,

16:58.191 --> 17:00.280
but the coach always said
I had great feet.

17:00.454 --> 17:03.413
My husband always said
that I had great feet.

17:03.587 --> 17:06.721
- Mmm.
- But he just
really liked feet.

17:13.249 --> 17:19.038
I heard that he passed away.

17:19.212 --> 17:20.561
Was it last year?

17:21.475 --> 17:23.085
- Yeah.
- Oh.

17:23.259 --> 17:24.260
Yeah.

17:24.434 --> 17:27.133
My wife, uh,
she passed away too.

17:27.307 --> 17:28.786
Oh, I'’m so sorry.

17:28.960 --> 17:31.267
- I'’m so sorry.
- You know,
these things happen.

17:33.487 --> 17:34.488
Hey.

17:35.924 --> 17:40.276
If you need someone
to accompany you
to the Super Bowl...

17:41.799 --> 17:43.236
Thank you so much,

17:43.410 --> 17:45.673
but I'’m already
going with friends. Thank you.

17:47.327 --> 17:50.417
But, hey, there is a lot
going on in this place

17:50.591 --> 17:52.027
- that you should explore.
- Mm-hmm. Yep.

17:52.201 --> 17:53.594
There'’s-- No, really.

17:53.768 --> 17:56.901
There'’s pool aerobics.
There'’s, um...

17:57.076 --> 17:59.121
There'’s dancing.

17:59.295 --> 18:01.210
- There'’s game night.
- Yeah.

18:01.384 --> 18:03.995
- Uh, lunch.
- Yeah.

18:04.170 --> 18:05.214
Lately, I'’ve...

18:07.173 --> 18:10.176
been realizing that
it'’s less about what you do,

18:10.350 --> 18:13.570
more about
who you do it with, you know?

18:14.397 --> 18:16.660
I look around this place, and...

18:21.883 --> 18:25.365
you'’re the only one
I really wanna be around,
you know?

18:25.539 --> 18:28.368
It seems like you got it
all figured out and...

18:37.072 --> 18:38.378
Talking to myself.

18:41.468 --> 18:43.383
Stop honking.
Betty hates it.

18:43.557 --> 18:44.949
She thinks it'’s bad manners.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.386
I know.
That'’s why I do it.

18:48.475 --> 18:50.433
You know,
you didn'’t have to
honk so many times.

18:50.607 --> 18:52.522
One toot is enough.

18:53.828 --> 18:54.916
Uh--

18:55.090 --> 18:57.179
This trunk is full.

18:57.353 --> 19:00.835
Lou, why didn'’t
we take your SUV?

19:01.009 --> 19:02.184
It'’s in the shop.

19:02.358 --> 19:03.968
Don'’t worry, Betty.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.666
This thing has plenty of room.

19:07.058 --> 19:08.495
- It'’s a '’93.
- It is? It'’s--

19:08.669 --> 19:10.323
They don'’t make them
like this anymore.

19:10.497 --> 19:12.281
They don'’t make this model
- like they used to.
- Oh, boy.

19:12.455 --> 19:16.459
<i>We are a mere two days away
from the Super Bowl.</i>

19:16.633 --> 19:18.113
<i>Yeah.
Houston better get ready.</i>

19:18.287 --> 19:19.854
<i>I think
they'’re gonna run out of beer.</i>

19:20.724 --> 19:21.638
Oh!

19:21.812 --> 19:23.118
Tight brakes.

19:23.292 --> 19:24.772
What you want me to do?
Not stop?

19:24.946 --> 19:27.818
She'’s not answering.
I'’ve called about ten times.

19:27.992 --> 19:29.211
Here, I'’ll get her.

19:29.385 --> 19:31.039
- It'’s the truth.
- Pacing will not help.

19:31.213 --> 19:32.736
Well, it can'’t hurt.

19:32.910 --> 19:33.868
Afternoon, Bill.

19:34.042 --> 19:35.261
Here he is. Here he is.

19:35.435 --> 19:36.479
- Hey, ladies.
- Yes. Hello.

19:36.653 --> 19:37.741
I'’m sorry.
I went and checked,

19:37.915 --> 19:39.221
but Maura'’s sleeping.

19:40.091 --> 19:40.962
Please wake her up.

19:41.136 --> 19:42.485
Please just wake her up.

19:42.659 --> 19:44.661
We don'’t just
wake anyone up here.

19:44.835 --> 19:46.010
It'’s a very strict policy.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.056
It'’s part of
our core philosophy.

19:48.230 --> 19:50.363
We take sleep seriously.

19:52.408 --> 19:53.627
See?

19:54.367 --> 19:55.368
Oh! Uh--

19:56.760 --> 19:57.805
Excuse me.

19:57.979 --> 19:59.110
Excuse me.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.200
Excuse me.

20:01.374 --> 20:03.158
Mmm. Mm-mmm.[Lou] Oh, damn it.

20:03.332 --> 20:05.421
- Maura! Maura!
- Oh, oh. Ladies. Seriously.

20:05.595 --> 20:06.770
- Shh! Please, please.
- Maura!

20:06.944 --> 20:08.294
- Okay. Okay, we'’re going.
- Thank you.

20:08.468 --> 20:09.817
- We just had a moment.
- Thank you.

20:09.991 --> 20:12.123
You guys are very fast.
That'’s a good sign.

20:13.473 --> 20:14.648
Where'’s Maura?

20:14.822 --> 20:16.258
She'’s sleeping,

20:16.432 --> 20:18.826
and the manager won'’t let us in
to wake her up.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.089
What do we do?
We'’re gonna miss our flight.

20:22.090 --> 20:23.787
I got it. I came prepared.

20:23.961 --> 20:25.485
There'’s no way
we'’re gonna make it. Where--

20:25.659 --> 20:26.790
What are you doing?

20:29.010 --> 20:31.491
Are all your suitcases
just wigs?

20:35.669 --> 20:36.626
Let'’s go.

20:37.888 --> 20:39.586
So you still get
the cute little face,

20:39.760 --> 20:41.240
but you don'’t get
all the breathing problems.

20:41.414 --> 20:43.503
Oh, that is fascinating.

20:43.677 --> 20:45.635
Do you have any photos?

20:45.809 --> 20:47.246
Oh, yeah. Sure.

20:47.420 --> 20:49.465
All I have is pug photos.

20:49.639 --> 20:51.989
Look at this guy.[gasps] Oh, look at that.

20:52.163 --> 20:53.687
That'’s Toffee... Uh-huh.

20:53.861 --> 20:55.602
...and that'’s Bobby
right there.
Let me show you.

20:55.776 --> 20:56.864
Can I take you on a tour?

20:58.822 --> 21:00.737
Wow.
- They have a cooking class.
- Wow. Look at that chef.

21:00.911 --> 21:02.348
- Maura was right.
- It'’s Emeril in there.

21:02.522 --> 21:04.132
They have
absolutely everything here.

21:04.306 --> 21:06.439
She'’s been wanting me to take
a pottery class with her,

21:06.613 --> 21:08.571
but honestly, I can'’t
see myself throwing a pot.

21:08.745 --> 21:12.445
<i>I hope that you feel
like you used your time
with him wisely,</i>

21:12.619 --> 21:13.750
<i>because you lied
to him.</i> Excuse me.

21:13.924 --> 21:15.839
Does anyone know
where Maura Martinez is?

21:18.059 --> 21:19.495
Wait for the commercial.

21:20.496 --> 21:21.584
She'’s in her room.

21:23.630 --> 21:24.718
Here, I'’ll take you.

21:26.546 --> 21:27.808
Come on, man.

21:27.982 --> 21:29.113
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.680
-  Sorry.
- Yeah.

21:30.854 --> 21:32.203
<i>Well,
I think she'’s sleeping.</i>

21:32.378 --> 21:34.641
Well, thanks, um... Mickey.

21:34.815 --> 21:36.251
Look, Mickey,

21:36.425 --> 21:38.993
our flight is leaving
in three hours and 23 minutes.

21:40.081 --> 21:41.822
I'’ll, uh--
Okay, well, I'’ll be here.

21:41.996 --> 21:43.693
- I'’ll be right out here.
- Maura?

21:43.867 --> 21:45.869
I'’ll just be
- standing guard out here.
- Maura? Oh!

21:46.043 --> 21:47.523
Maura? Maura?

21:47.697 --> 21:49.090
- Honey, I can do this.
- Ma-- Okay. All right.

21:49.264 --> 21:51.048
Maura. [shouting] Maura!

21:51.788 --> 21:53.137
She'’s got a pulse.

21:55.836 --> 21:58.012
- I can'’t read that.
- Sleeping pills.

21:58.752 --> 22:00.014
Oh. Get a wheelchair.

22:00.188 --> 22:01.537
- Get a wheelchair.
- Mickey?

22:01.711 --> 22:02.843
- Oh, Mickey, good.
- Yeah?

22:03.017 --> 22:05.367
Could you possibly
get us a wheelchair?

22:06.063 --> 22:08.022
- A wheelchair?
- Yeah.

22:08.196 --> 22:09.676
You'’re breaking her out,
aren'’t you?

22:09.850 --> 22:11.417
Well, no, we'’re actually--
We'’re going--

22:11.591 --> 22:14.245
- No, you'’re breaking her out.
- Okay. Yeah.

22:14.420 --> 22:17.118
Well, it figures
that she'’d have
really cool friends.

22:17.292 --> 22:18.424
He'’s getting one.

22:19.468 --> 22:21.992
Take these with us.
They belong to her.

22:22.166 --> 22:24.604
- This cash too.
- Well, that--

22:24.778 --> 22:26.562
I'’ll give it to her
- in the car.
- All right.

22:26.736 --> 22:28.608
You'’ll witness it.
- You'’ll see it.
- Okay. I'’m witnessing.

22:28.782 --> 22:30.305
-  Is it clear?
- Yeah, it'’s clear.

22:30.479 --> 22:31.741
- Let'’s go. Let'’s go.
- Okay.

22:31.915 --> 22:33.439
- All clear.
- Out of the way.
Out of the way.

22:33.613 --> 22:35.266
- Go ahead. Go ahead.
- Watch your feet.

22:35.441 --> 22:36.790
This way, to the left.

22:36.964 --> 22:38.487
- To the left. Go, go, go.
- Here we go. Here we go.

22:38.661 --> 22:39.923
That was
our deluxe garden suite,

22:40.097 --> 22:41.969
but you know
our resort is 60 and over,

22:42.143 --> 22:45.973
so you might have to wait
- a few more years to qualify.
- Oh.

22:46.147 --> 22:47.191
Hey!

22:48.323 --> 22:49.280
- Go!
- Where are you going?

22:49.455 --> 22:50.630
- Stop right there.
- Tony, wait.

22:50.804 --> 22:52.022
Do you even care
about my dogs?

22:52.196 --> 22:53.241
No, I don'’t.

22:53.981 --> 22:55.548
Go. Go. I got you.

22:55.722 --> 22:57.811
Hey,
she'’s still sleeping.
Come back. Wait.

22:57.985 --> 23:02.685
Ladies and gentlemen,
Pat Sajak from <i>Wheel of Fortune</i>
is in the house.

23:02.859 --> 23:06.167
Pat Sajak is here,
and he'’s signing autographs
right now.

23:06.341 --> 23:08.125
- Pat Sajak.
- Hey, Cecile.
What'’s going on?

23:08.299 --> 23:10.127
Where is the party at, huh?

23:10.301 --> 23:11.825
Oh, What'’s going on? Hey.
There'’s Vanna here too.

23:14.305 --> 23:16.133
Thank you, Mickey.[Betty] Thank you so much.

23:16.307 --> 23:17.613
Oh, Trish, there you are.

23:17.787 --> 23:18.701
Come on!

23:20.137 --> 23:21.530
We did it.

23:21.704 --> 23:23.924
Whoo!

23:26.187 --> 23:28.015
Wh-What are we celebrating?

23:28.189 --> 23:29.712
Oh, Maura.[Trish] We broke you out.

23:29.886 --> 23:31.410
We'’re going
to the Super Bowl!

23:31.584 --> 23:34.413
We'’re going to
- the Super Bowl!
- What? Oh!

23:36.240 --> 23:38.982
<i>We'’re going to
the Super Bowl.</i>

23:49.297 --> 23:50.777
I'’m starving.

23:50.951 --> 23:53.388
Let'’s go to a bar.
- I love bars.
- No kidding.

23:53.562 --> 23:56.130
We'’re not going to a bar
so you can talk to men.

23:56.304 --> 23:58.741
Lou, I told you
I am not gonna flirt.

23:58.915 --> 24:01.178
I know this is a girls trip.

24:01.352 --> 24:03.050
Well, maybe I'’ll flirt.

24:03.224 --> 24:05.052
I don'’t think
I'’ve ever flirted
in my whole life.

24:05.226 --> 24:08.011
-  You can do it.
- Okay. Okay.

24:13.234 --> 24:14.278
Hrishi?

24:17.020 --> 24:19.719
You have a nice head.

24:20.850 --> 24:21.895
Why, thank you.

24:22.852 --> 24:24.158
- We'’ll work on it.
- Okay.

24:24.332 --> 24:25.551
Yeah.

24:25.725 --> 24:27.901
[Lou] Oh, Erhan Suites.

24:28.075 --> 24:30.599
Is this great or what?

24:30.773 --> 24:33.080
And it'’s all
Super Bowl themed.

24:33.254 --> 24:35.648
Yeah, but they only
gave us one room.

24:35.822 --> 24:37.954
And there'’s no more rooms
in the whole hotel.

24:38.128 --> 24:40.348
There'’s no more rooms
in the whole city.

24:40.522 --> 24:42.611
At least this one
has two beds.

24:42.785 --> 24:43.917
Be appreciative.

24:44.091 --> 24:45.353
Oh, look. There'’s Tom.

24:46.833 --> 24:49.400
Oh, he'’s much bigger
in real life.

24:49.575 --> 24:51.402
That'’s just a cardboard him.

24:53.013 --> 24:56.756
The real him is
at least twice that size.

24:56.930 --> 24:58.192
Oh, Tom.

24:58.366 --> 25:00.977
Make that pass. Make it.

25:01.151 --> 25:03.719
I'’m taking this one.
He'’s cute.

25:03.893 --> 25:06.592
Maura! Who did you pick?

25:16.645 --> 25:17.951
- Hi. Hi.
- Mmm?

25:18.125 --> 25:19.387
<i>Hey, Mom?</i>

25:19.561 --> 25:22.172
Um, hey, I just got a call
from the hospital

25:22.346 --> 25:24.914
saying they'’re trying
to reach you
and you'’re not answering.

25:25.088 --> 25:28.265
<i>They called me
as your emergency contact.
Is everything okay?</i>

25:28.439 --> 25:31.617
Yes, I'’m fine.
Everything'’s fine.

25:31.791 --> 25:34.271
I-- I just had some tests done.

25:34.445 --> 25:35.838
They'’re calling...

25:37.144 --> 25:38.885
to go over them.

25:39.059 --> 25:40.887
Why are you whispering?

25:41.670 --> 25:43.890
<i>I'’m in a hotel room,</i>

25:44.064 --> 25:46.066
and the other girls
are sleeping.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.633
<i>W-Where are you?</i>

25:49.112 --> 25:50.723
Uh, New Hampshire.

25:50.897 --> 25:54.074
We took a little trip
to a bed-and-breakfast.

25:54.248 --> 25:55.771
<i>Oh, that sounds nice.</i>

25:55.945 --> 25:58.339
Um, Mom,
call your doctor back. <i>Okay.</i>

25:58.513 --> 25:59.601
Night, sweetie.

25:59.775 --> 26:01.081
All right, love you. Night.

26:01.255 --> 26:02.561
Love you.

26:11.744 --> 26:12.875
I can'’t sleep.

26:13.528 --> 26:15.269
Me neither.

26:19.012 --> 26:20.448
I miss Frank.

26:22.450 --> 26:24.583
I miss sleeping next to him.

26:26.454 --> 26:28.064
Nighttime'’s the worst.

26:30.240 --> 26:34.897
I just lay there, awake,
thinking of him.

26:36.986 --> 26:39.249
I feel like
I'’m just living in the past,

26:40.555 --> 26:42.383
and I can'’t move on.

26:43.384 --> 26:47.040
Maura, you'’re not
living in the past.

26:47.214 --> 26:49.782
You'’re right here with us.

26:49.956 --> 26:51.740
And we'’re here for you.

26:53.437 --> 26:56.005
I love you.

26:56.179 --> 26:58.007
Oh, I love you.

27:01.881 --> 27:06.799
Here, section 138, row 30,
seats four, five, six and seven.

27:06.973 --> 27:08.235
They'’re so shiny.

27:08.844 --> 27:09.976
Can I hold them?

27:11.717 --> 27:13.893
Oh![Lou] Oh! Uh-oh!

27:14.067 --> 27:15.634
- Caught one.
- We can'’t lose those.

27:15.808 --> 27:17.331
- You'’re right.
- Those are gold.

27:17.505 --> 27:19.681
Well, clearly, you shouldn'’t
be holding them, then.

27:19.855 --> 27:22.075
How many reading glasses
have you gone through this year?

27:22.249 --> 27:23.598
That doesn'’t count.

27:23.772 --> 27:26.122
Reading glasses
are designed to be lost.

27:29.560 --> 27:30.605
Okay, fine.

27:30.779 --> 27:33.129
Who'’s the most responsible one?

27:33.739 --> 27:34.653
Oh!

27:34.827 --> 27:36.045
Me.

27:36.219 --> 27:37.264
Okay.

27:39.309 --> 27:41.137
Good thing
I brought my strap-on.

27:42.530 --> 27:44.097
Um...

27:44.271 --> 27:45.228
...I don'’t think
that'’s what it'’s called.

27:45.402 --> 27:46.273
Sure it is. Look.

27:46.447 --> 27:48.536
You just strap...

27:50.233 --> 27:51.495
- it on.
- Wow.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.236
That'’s a fanny pack.

27:53.410 --> 27:55.151
Not if you don'’t wear it
around your fanny.

27:55.325 --> 27:58.328
If you wear it like this,
it'’s a strap-on.

27:59.068 --> 28:00.896
And I will keep them safe.

28:01.070 --> 28:02.463
Okay.

28:02.637 --> 28:05.509
Before we head out,
let'’s look at the agenda.

28:05.684 --> 28:08.077
First up,
the NFL Experience.

28:08.251 --> 28:09.862
Wait a minute,
"agenda" sounds like work.

28:10.036 --> 28:10.993
I love a good agenda.

28:11.167 --> 28:12.778
- Let'’s go to a spa.
- No.

28:12.952 --> 28:15.563
We didn'’t win these tickets
to go to a spa.

28:15.737 --> 28:17.696
We came here for football.

28:17.870 --> 28:20.568
We'’re going to have
the NFL experience.

28:26.095 --> 28:28.402
I can'’t believe
we'’re actually here.

28:28.576 --> 28:29.969
I can'’t believe it.

28:33.537 --> 28:35.801
Oh, my gosh.
This place is huge.

28:35.975 --> 28:38.020
Look at all the helmets.

28:38.194 --> 28:39.892
Oh, oh! I wanna get one
for my grandkids.

28:40.066 --> 28:42.590
Oh, this is better
than my wildest dreams.

28:42.764 --> 28:43.678
Not mine.

28:43.852 --> 28:45.201
This morning, I had a dream

28:45.375 --> 28:47.813
I was going down
the Amazon River on a pickle

28:47.987 --> 28:50.380
with my papier-mâché children.

28:50.554 --> 28:52.426
There'’s so much here to do.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.994
Yeah, well, you don'’t need
a brochure to tell you that.

28:55.168 --> 28:56.386
You know what?
I'’ve looked at this.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.258
If we wanna hit
all the booths,

28:58.432 --> 29:00.782
we have to average
under five minutes
for each one

29:00.956 --> 29:02.523
except, you know, the big--

29:16.319 --> 29:18.017
<i>Welcome to the QB Countdown.</i>

29:18.191 --> 29:21.542
<i>Let'’s see how many passes
you can complete in 45 seconds.</i>

29:21.716 --> 29:22.804
I'’m good at this. Watch.

29:22.978 --> 29:24.284
-  Next.
- I know. I know.

29:24.458 --> 29:26.547
Oh, I thought you was
waiting on your grandson.

29:26.721 --> 29:28.418
Nope, I'’m here to play.

29:28.592 --> 29:30.638
Well, good luck, Nana.

29:30.812 --> 29:32.509
I don'’t want you
to break anything.

29:32.683 --> 29:34.990
Hey, you sound confident.

29:35.164 --> 29:37.558
Would you like to
place a little wager on it?

29:40.039 --> 29:41.605
Ten bucks says
she won'’t hit
more than five.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.912
That'’s not a bet.

29:44.086 --> 29:46.610
She wins, she gets
your Falcons jersey.

29:48.395 --> 29:50.092
- Deal.
- Deal.

29:54.009 --> 29:55.532
There you go. Okay.

29:55.706 --> 29:57.534
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:57.708 --> 29:59.623
Technically,
we don'’t allow betting here.

29:59.798 --> 30:00.842
<i>Hey, Lou.</i>

30:01.016 --> 30:02.148
But they don'’t pay me that much,

30:02.322 --> 30:04.150
so let'’s see
how this plays out.

30:04.324 --> 30:05.847
<i>Lou! Look up.</i> Yeah. Let'’s see
how this plays out.

30:06.021 --> 30:09.068
<i>I'’m up here.
I'’m talking to you.</i>

30:09.242 --> 30:12.158
<i>Louella, don'’t worry about
how hard you throw it.</i>

30:12.332 --> 30:14.813
<i>It'’s all about
accuracy and touch.</i>

30:16.249 --> 30:17.250
All right, now. You'’re up.

30:18.207 --> 30:19.730
All right.[game referee] All right.

30:21.080 --> 30:24.387
Ready. Set. Throw.

30:24.561 --> 30:26.041
Come on, Granny!

30:26.215 --> 30:28.304
Smoke '’em! Smoke '’em, Lou.

30:29.915 --> 30:31.960
- Oh!
- Hey, when are you
gonna start throwing?

30:32.134 --> 30:34.049
- For Pete'’s sake.
- Ma'’am, would you
mind your business?

30:34.223 --> 30:36.399
I'’ve never seen anything
like this in my life.

30:36.573 --> 30:38.053
Is there
- a mute button for her?
- Oh, oh, oh!

30:38.227 --> 30:40.099
- Really?
- I am terrified.

30:40.273 --> 30:42.405
Seriously, the eld--Do you have anything else
to do with your life?

30:42.579 --> 30:44.146
Oh, you'’re killing him.
You'’re killing him.

30:44.320 --> 30:46.061
Ma'’am, you are
stressing me out, okay?

30:46.235 --> 30:47.976
Oh, really?
Is it distracting?

30:48.150 --> 30:49.848
- I hope so.
- You dropped your multivitamin.

30:50.022 --> 30:51.371
Fancy footwork.
Look at that.

30:51.545 --> 30:52.720
Man, that is something.

30:52.894 --> 30:53.764
Whoo!

30:53.939 --> 30:55.288
Oh, my--Will you back up?

30:55.462 --> 30:57.333
- That'’s really unimpressive.
- Oh, my goodness.

30:57.507 --> 30:59.335
- Amazing!
- Ma'’am!

30:59.509 --> 31:02.034
Six, five, four... She'’s definitely
been day drinking.

31:02.208 --> 31:04.471
That'’s what her problem is....three, two, one!

31:06.821 --> 31:09.868
- You did it! I told you.
- I knew I'’d make it.
I knew.

31:10.042 --> 31:11.260
That was incredible.

31:11.434 --> 31:12.783
Yeah, you, uh, you scored
over 20 points,

31:12.958 --> 31:14.437
which means you get
a free Super Bowl jersey.

31:14.611 --> 31:16.396
I want the Brady.
I want the Brady.

31:16.570 --> 31:17.919
What size are you?

31:19.399 --> 31:20.313
I'’m not wearing that.

31:20.487 --> 31:21.444
We can go double or nothing

31:21.618 --> 31:22.750
if you want your jersey back.

31:22.924 --> 31:25.231
But if we win,
you gotta wear that.

31:25.405 --> 31:27.059
Fine.

31:27.233 --> 31:30.627
Trish, we'’re in Houston.
Can'’t we get some barbecue?

31:31.411 --> 31:33.152
Oh, your book! Look.

31:34.414 --> 31:35.719
They have it.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.460
- Look at-- Sign it.
- My God.

31:38.940 --> 31:41.769
- Come on. Really?
- Yes. I have a pen.
It'’s here somewhere.

31:41.943 --> 31:42.901
You'’re bad.

31:44.467 --> 31:45.512
All right.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.428
Excuse me, what are you doing?

31:48.602 --> 31:51.561
Oh, I'’m just
admiring these books.

31:51.735 --> 31:53.172
Uh, you'’re gonna have to
pay for that.

31:53.346 --> 31:55.087
She'’s signing it.

31:56.740 --> 31:59.395
You'’re--
- You'’re Virginia Ledough?
- Ledoux.

32:00.135 --> 32:01.528
Oh, my gosh.

32:01.702 --> 32:04.009
I sell so many copies
of your book.

32:04.183 --> 32:05.358
And I'’m a personal fan.

32:05.532 --> 32:06.837
You know what?
You guys just go ahead.

32:07.012 --> 32:08.448
I'’m gonna find some barbecue.

32:08.622 --> 32:10.319
- I think it'’s outside.
- I'’ll see you in a bit.

32:10.493 --> 32:12.104
Are you working on anything new?

32:12.278 --> 32:15.194
Actually, yeah.
I'’m working on
a holiday-themed book.

32:15.368 --> 32:17.196
<i>I Gronk You
a Merry Christmas.</i>

32:17.370 --> 32:18.632
Can I preorder?

32:18.806 --> 32:20.068
Yeah, absolutely.

32:20.242 --> 32:23.115
Holidays are
a very sexual time for me.

32:24.377 --> 32:25.421
Wow.

32:26.074 --> 32:27.336
Uh, hello?

32:27.510 --> 32:28.511
Excuse me.

32:29.251 --> 32:31.123
Oh. Hi. Um...

32:31.297 --> 32:32.863
I'’d like to get some wings.

32:33.038 --> 32:34.561
Oh, I'’m sorry.
They'’re not for sale.

32:34.735 --> 32:36.650
This is a spicy wings contest.

32:37.216 --> 32:38.478
- Really?
- Yeah.

32:38.652 --> 32:40.610
But I must warn you,
it gets really intense.

32:40.784 --> 32:43.178
They got spices that sound like
they'’re from a horror film.

32:43.352 --> 32:44.875
- Like what?
- California Reaper...

32:45.050 --> 32:47.530
Whoa....ghost pepper,
Teddy Bears Picnic.

32:47.704 --> 32:49.228
Now, that one'’s the most scary

32:49.402 --> 32:51.230
'’cause it sounds like
it'’s all warm and cuddly,

32:51.404 --> 32:54.537
but it'’s not.
- It'’s really not.
- Oh.

32:54.711 --> 32:56.452
Well, I could use
a little spice.

32:56.626 --> 32:57.714
This ain'’t no little spice.

32:58.672 --> 33:00.021
And this is his contest.

33:00.891 --> 33:01.805
Guy Fieri.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.198
Oh.

33:03.372 --> 33:04.547
I mean, look at him.

33:05.461 --> 33:06.897
He even looks spicy.

33:08.290 --> 33:09.204
I'’m in.

33:09.378 --> 33:10.597
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

33:10.771 --> 33:12.555
I'’m gonna need
your emergency contacts

33:12.729 --> 33:15.602
- in case something happens.
- Well, that would be
my husband, Mark.

33:15.776 --> 33:17.865
But don'’t call him.
Don'’t call him.

33:18.039 --> 33:20.389
I don'’t want him
knowing I was doing this.

33:20.563 --> 33:22.565
If you black out,
you don'’t want me
to call your husband?

33:22.739 --> 33:25.220
- No. Don'’t call him.
- So who do
you want me to call?

33:26.917 --> 33:28.006
An ambulance?

33:38.668 --> 33:39.930
Yay!

33:43.412 --> 33:45.110
Ladies and gentlemen!

33:45.284 --> 33:49.418
Are you ready for
the Spicy BBQ
Hot Wings Challenge?

33:51.029 --> 33:52.900
The rules are simple.

33:53.074 --> 33:55.990
If you don'’t wanna
clear your seat,
you better handle the heat.

33:56.164 --> 33:58.166
You touch the milk, you'’re gone.

33:58.340 --> 34:01.561
Let'’s bring out
the pain train to Flavortown.

34:01.735 --> 34:04.955
In three, two, one.
Bring the pain.

34:10.309 --> 34:12.876
Oh, my God.
- That'’s Betty!
- Oh, my God.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.531
This is the train to pain.

34:15.705 --> 34:17.185
Who can handle the heat?

34:17.359 --> 34:18.795
Hold it together.

34:18.969 --> 34:20.188
Hang in there.

34:20.362 --> 34:22.277
Hang in there. Hang in there.

34:22.451 --> 34:24.062
Oh! You'’re gone.

34:24.236 --> 34:25.324
Go. Go. Go.

34:25.498 --> 34:27.413
Excuse me, Betty?

34:27.587 --> 34:30.416
You don'’t have to
- eat it all.
- It'’s okay. I'’m hungry.

34:30.590 --> 34:31.721
I know her!

34:31.895 --> 34:33.636
"And it was then,

34:33.810 --> 34:37.597
on the hallowed turf
of Gillette Stadium,

34:37.771 --> 34:39.903
that Gronk took her,

34:40.078 --> 34:41.905
and she knew

34:42.080 --> 34:46.084
this was the best
a man could get."

34:50.305 --> 34:52.525
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

34:52.699 --> 34:55.136
This is all so unexpected.

34:55.310 --> 34:57.834
Uh, if I'’m not mistaken,
Mrs. Ledoux,

34:58.008 --> 34:59.314
you are a multi-hyphenate.

34:59.488 --> 35:02.361
Aren'’t you
the original Mayflower Girl?

35:02.535 --> 35:03.666
I love your book.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.538
Thank you.

35:05.712 --> 35:08.062
Well, that was--
that was a long time ago.

35:08.236 --> 35:10.195
Well, beauty has
no expiration date.

35:11.631 --> 35:12.893
Dan O'’Callahan.

35:15.852 --> 35:17.332
Oh, my God. That ring.

35:18.638 --> 35:20.292
Oh, my God. The fingernails.

35:21.423 --> 35:23.947
Football nails.
- You'’ve got two rings.
- Yep.

35:24.122 --> 35:27.037
I have to assume
- you-- you played.
- I did.

35:27.212 --> 35:29.170
Two Super Bowls.
Two different teams.

35:29.344 --> 35:32.608
So, do I just call you
the Mayflower Girl?

35:32.782 --> 35:33.827
Patricia.

35:34.001 --> 35:35.220
-  Love your book.
- Thank you.

35:35.394 --> 35:36.438
- Saved our marriage.
- Thanks.

35:36.612 --> 35:38.048
Wait a minute,
not Virginia?

35:39.485 --> 35:42.531
Uh, Virginia Ledoux
was the name of my poodle.

35:42.705 --> 35:46.231
Well, your poodle
must have a real thing
for football players.

35:46.405 --> 35:47.449
No.

35:48.537 --> 35:49.973
I do.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.236
Ladies and gentlemen,

35:51.410 --> 35:53.151
here we are
at the pinnacle of pain,

35:53.325 --> 35:54.674
the temple of heat.

35:54.848 --> 35:56.415
Our final round,

35:56.589 --> 35:58.982
Dal versus Betty.

36:00.462 --> 36:01.855
Dal, how you feeling, bud?

36:02.029 --> 36:03.857
I'’m feeling great, Guy--All right. Great, Dal.

36:04.031 --> 36:05.424
And, Betty, everything okay?

36:05.598 --> 36:06.860
Yeah,
I'’m just getting ready.

36:07.034 --> 36:08.818
All right.
Remember, embrace the spice.

36:08.992 --> 36:11.560
Lean into this. Don'’t fight it.
It only makes it harder.

36:11.734 --> 36:13.301
- Okay.
- You go big or you go home.

36:13.475 --> 36:14.998
- Okay.
- All right.

36:15.173 --> 36:18.785
All right.
For this final round,
Satan'’s Tongue.

36:18.959 --> 36:20.656
The most difficult wing
we have.

36:20.830 --> 36:23.964
And we'’re going
on three, two, one.

36:24.573 --> 36:25.879
Bring the heat!

36:26.053 --> 36:29.056
Dal gets a nice portion.
So does Betty.

36:29.230 --> 36:31.363
Dal with one--
Dal with one bite.

36:32.494 --> 36:33.495
Betty with two.

36:34.061 --> 36:35.062
Dal?

36:35.236 --> 36:36.455
Dal'’s not looking good.

36:36.629 --> 36:38.544
Dal'’s shaking.
Betty has another bite.

36:38.718 --> 36:40.502
Dal spits. Dal'’s out!

36:40.676 --> 36:43.070
Give it up
for our champ, Betty!

36:44.463 --> 36:45.464
Oh, well...

36:46.682 --> 36:48.380
Ladies and gentlemen,
your champ, Betty!

36:48.554 --> 36:50.686
Betty, how'’d you pull that off?

36:50.860 --> 36:52.906
That one had a...
...bit of a kick.

36:53.080 --> 36:54.647
A b-- Listen,

36:54.821 --> 36:56.823
it was amazing to watch you
knock that out of the park.

36:56.997 --> 36:58.128
How did you do this?

36:58.303 --> 36:59.826
How do you handle
spice at this level?

37:00.696 --> 37:02.437
I don'’t know.

37:02.611 --> 37:05.832
Unless it has extreme flavor,
I can'’t taste anything anymore.

37:06.006 --> 37:07.137
Well, speaking of
extreme flavor,

37:07.312 --> 37:09.314
I got some brisket
you gotta try.

37:09.488 --> 37:12.404
- Can I bring my friends?
- Absolutely!
You'’re the champ!

37:12.578 --> 37:14.101
Give it up for champ Betty!

37:16.234 --> 37:17.670
Maura, would you like
some more brisket?

37:17.844 --> 37:20.716
Oh, I could eat your brisket
all day long, you brute.

37:20.890 --> 37:22.588
There you go. There you go.

37:22.762 --> 37:23.806
Mmm! Mmm!

37:23.980 --> 37:25.243
It'’s so good.

37:25.808 --> 37:27.593
- Ah!
- Trish!

37:27.767 --> 37:28.898
- Oh, hi.
- Trish!

37:29.072 --> 37:30.204
Are you Guy Fieri?

37:30.378 --> 37:32.250
Of course he is.
Where have you been?

37:32.424 --> 37:33.381
I'’ve been talking to a fan,

37:33.555 --> 37:34.904
and he invited us
to a party.

37:35.078 --> 37:36.645
- Look.
- A fan?

37:36.819 --> 37:38.125
A fan of my writing.

37:39.126 --> 37:40.736
Also a two-time
Super Bowl champion.

37:40.910 --> 37:42.042
Trish.

37:42.216 --> 37:44.000
I didn'’t flirt.
I mean, he did.

37:44.174 --> 37:46.873
Don'’t you think
we should rest before
the big game tomorrow?

37:47.047 --> 37:48.483
Wait. If it'’s that party,

37:48.657 --> 37:50.268
oh, you go--
It'’s gonna be off the hook.

37:50.442 --> 37:52.052
I'’m going to that party.

37:52.226 --> 37:53.923
Yeah. I mean, he'’s right.
Look, we'’re not playing.

37:55.621 --> 37:57.971
I thought the whole point
of this trip was having
an adventure together.

37:58.145 --> 37:59.320
This is an adventure.

37:59.494 --> 38:00.539
I'’m there.

38:00.713 --> 38:02.018
Will there be dancing?

38:02.192 --> 38:03.803
If you'’re going,
there'’ll be dancing.

38:06.893 --> 38:08.590
- Oh, gosh. Betty?
- Yes?

38:08.764 --> 38:10.549
Betty, Betty, Betty.
Let me just check your lips.

38:10.723 --> 38:12.420
Oh.

38:12.594 --> 38:14.857
You,
- who never wear lipstick.
- Uh-huh.

38:15.031 --> 38:16.946
Okay, good.
- Don'’t lick your lips.
- All right.

38:17.120 --> 38:18.296
Let me see
your beauty mark.

38:18.470 --> 38:19.862
- Very good.
- Come on. Let'’s go.

38:20.036 --> 38:22.038
Okay. Hot stuff.

38:23.431 --> 38:25.041
Are we gonna be
the oldest people here?

38:25.215 --> 38:27.696
Betty,
don'’t reinforce stereotypes.

38:27.870 --> 38:29.916
Oh, there'’s Dan. Dan!

38:31.526 --> 38:33.311
You have a fan named Dan?

38:33.485 --> 38:34.834
Yeah, Dan O'’Callahan.

38:35.008 --> 38:36.357
Hey, come on up!

38:36.531 --> 38:37.358
I thought you said
you'’ve been working out.

38:37.532 --> 38:38.620
I have.

38:38.794 --> 38:40.230
How many leg days
have you skipped?

38:40.405 --> 38:41.928
Look at those chicken legs.

38:42.102 --> 38:44.452
That'’s mean.
He'’s got great legs.

38:44.626 --> 38:47.150
Oh, it'’s called "negging."
It'’s how we flirt.

38:47.325 --> 38:50.240
Why would you focus
- on negative things?
- Can you let them up?

38:50.415 --> 38:52.025
Oh, he'’s getting us in.[bouncer] Sorry, ladies.

38:52.199 --> 38:53.896
You know, he used to
- play for the Pats.
- Sorry.

38:54.070 --> 38:55.768
It is so great
to meet you all.

38:55.942 --> 38:57.552
Dan.
You played for the Pats?

38:57.726 --> 38:59.162
- I did. For three years.
- Wow.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.556
But I spent most of my time
with the Raiders.

39:01.730 --> 39:02.644
Hmm.

39:02.818 --> 39:03.863
Okay.

39:04.037 --> 39:06.300
You look lovely.

39:06.474 --> 39:07.475
Thank you.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.174
Well, hey, I wanna
introduce you to
some of my friends.

39:11.349 --> 39:12.437
Come on inside.

39:12.611 --> 39:14.047
Where'’s Maura?
Where'’s Maura?

39:14.221 --> 39:16.092
Oh, oh, oh. Come on, Maura.
We gotta stick together.

39:16.266 --> 39:18.356
Christ'’s sake.
- Have you lost your mind?
- Excuse us.

39:18.530 --> 39:20.575
Thank you so much.
- Thank you.
- It'’s too bad.

39:20.749 --> 39:22.403
- Bye. Thanks a lot.
- You are gentlemen.

39:22.577 --> 39:23.883
I really appreciate it.[Betty] Come on.

39:25.450 --> 39:27.016
Where did Trish go?

39:27.190 --> 39:30.237
Wow. I have never been
to a party like this.

39:31.760 --> 39:34.415
The only parties we go to
are faculty parties

39:34.589 --> 39:36.461
where they just
have cheap champagne.

39:36.635 --> 39:39.246
Last party I went to
was a funeral.

39:40.552 --> 39:41.770
It was fun.

39:41.944 --> 39:43.424
I bet they'’ve got
tons of drugs here.

39:43.598 --> 39:44.556
Piles of cocaine.

39:44.730 --> 39:46.122
I bet they even have

39:46.296 --> 39:48.168
one of those <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>
sex rooms somewhere,

39:48.342 --> 39:49.691
don'’t you think?

39:49.865 --> 39:51.693
You know, I'’m gonna
head back to the hotel.

39:51.867 --> 39:53.826
- I-- I need to relax.
- Here.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.697
Oh, thank you.

39:56.698 --> 39:58.004
Who are you?

39:58.178 --> 40:00.485
Oh, we met outside.
Yes, this is--Sophie.

40:00.659 --> 40:02.704
- Sophie. Oh, this is Sophie.
- Yeah.

40:02.878 --> 40:04.445
What a lovely name.

40:04.619 --> 40:06.578
That'’s my granddaughter'’s name,
- Sophie.
- Mmm!

40:06.752 --> 40:08.231
Just a wonderful name.

40:08.406 --> 40:09.798
- These are good.
- Very good.

40:09.972 --> 40:11.365
Well, careful.
They'’re high dosage.

40:11.539 --> 40:13.280
- What?
- High dosage?

40:14.150 --> 40:15.630
-  Yeah.
- Are they drugs?

40:16.805 --> 40:18.633
Yeah. You said
you wanted to relax.

40:18.807 --> 40:20.200
Mmm.

40:20.374 --> 40:21.636
What-- Sophie!

40:22.420 --> 40:23.464
Say, Sophie!

40:23.638 --> 40:24.639
Lou, where are you going?

40:24.813 --> 40:26.989
I ate two of '’em. Two gummies.

40:27.163 --> 40:29.252
What'’ll happen
if I had three?

40:31.124 --> 40:32.517
Your friend drugged us.

40:32.691 --> 40:34.867
Big deal. You used to
smoke pot all the time.

40:35.041 --> 40:36.259
That was medicinal.

40:36.434 --> 40:39.828
All right. Okay.
We did it. We took drugs.

40:40.002 --> 40:42.614
But let'’s just,
you know, enjoy it.

40:42.788 --> 40:44.224
I'’m going back to the hotel.

40:44.398 --> 40:45.747
I need my ticket.

40:45.921 --> 40:47.096
I'’ve gotta get some sleep

40:47.270 --> 40:48.794
so I'’m fresh
for the game tomorrow,

40:48.968 --> 40:49.969
which is why we'’re here.

40:52.014 --> 40:55.278
Unless you two are so hungover
you can'’t join me.

40:57.280 --> 40:58.412
Gimme the ticket.

40:58.586 --> 40:59.718
Oh, God. Wait.

40:59.892 --> 41:01.328
I left it at the hotel,
didn'’t I?

41:01.502 --> 41:02.938
I took it off at the--

41:03.112 --> 41:04.418
God, no, I didn'’t. I didn'’t.

41:04.592 --> 41:06.507
I took it off at
the spicy wings contest.

41:06.681 --> 41:07.769
I-- I put it down on the--

41:07.943 --> 41:09.292
You'’ve lost the tickets?

41:09.467 --> 41:11.294
No, I was trying to pretend
it wasn'’t spicy,

41:11.469 --> 41:12.948
and it was
really, really spicy, and I--

41:13.122 --> 41:14.472
We'’ve got to
find those tickets.

41:14.646 --> 41:17.039
We'’ve got to go to
the NFL Experience now.

41:17.213 --> 41:18.998
- It'’s closed.
- Look. Listen.

41:19.172 --> 41:21.696
Now, just calm down.
Everybody calm down.

41:21.870 --> 41:24.482
Guy said he was going to be
at this party tonight.

41:24.656 --> 41:26.092
We just find Guy.

41:26.266 --> 41:28.573
I'’m sure he knows where
the strap-on thing is--

41:28.747 --> 41:33.578
How do you expect to find
one guy in a sea of thousands?

41:33.752 --> 41:35.144
Huh?

41:35.318 --> 41:37.277
- Huh?
- There! There he is.
There he is.

41:37.451 --> 41:39.627
- Where? I don'’t see him.
- He went that way.

41:39.801 --> 41:41.411
I don'’t see him.
Why are you jogging?

41:41.586 --> 41:43.152
I'’m jogging
because he'’s jogging.

41:43.326 --> 41:44.458
Girls?

42:01.475 --> 42:02.911
Guy?

42:10.353 --> 42:11.529
Maura?

42:13.400 --> 42:14.836
Where did Maura go?

42:15.010 --> 42:16.446
Well, I don'’t know.
Where'’s Guy?

42:16.621 --> 42:17.709
I thought
we were looking for him.

42:33.115 --> 42:34.595
<i>Eyes Wide Shut.</i>

42:54.833 --> 42:59.968
<i>♪ Oh, why is nobody dancing?
Yeah♪</i>

43:00.142 --> 43:05.104
<i>♪ Why is nobody getting down? ♪</i> We lost him.

43:05.278 --> 43:07.019
Lou, look! Look!

43:07.193 --> 43:08.498
Where? Where?

43:09.804 --> 43:11.806
We gotta find those tickets.

43:11.980 --> 43:16.681
Yes, but doesn'’t this music
make you want to dance?

43:16.855 --> 43:18.030
No, we'’ve gotta stay focused.

43:18.204 --> 43:20.293
Yes, but it'’s so...

43:21.207 --> 43:22.730
- So good.
- Oh, yeah.

43:27.866 --> 43:30.477
Excuse me.
I'’m looking for someone.

43:32.044 --> 43:34.176
You here for the poker game?

43:34.350 --> 43:35.743
You want some Skittles?

43:35.917 --> 43:37.615
Are you okay?

43:38.659 --> 43:39.747
I think so.

43:40.835 --> 43:42.184
Have a seat.

43:57.417 --> 43:58.766
I'’m Guy Fieri.

44:18.046 --> 44:19.178
Oh! Oh, my God!

44:21.484 --> 44:22.964
I'’m so sorry I hit you.

44:23.748 --> 44:25.010
- Let me see.
- Mmm.

44:25.793 --> 44:27.229
It'’s not bad. It'’s not bad.

44:27.403 --> 44:28.883
You just--

44:29.057 --> 44:31.669
It'’s just I like to dance.
I never get to dance.

44:34.193 --> 44:36.456
That gummy bear
was a humdinger.

44:36.630 --> 44:39.111
Maybe you oughta slow down.

44:39.285 --> 44:42.157
Yeah. Maybe you oughta
slow down too.

44:42.331 --> 44:43.985
This is pretty slow.

44:44.159 --> 44:46.161
At the hottest party
in Houston,
with the hottest people,

44:46.335 --> 44:48.598
I'’m sitting here
with someone'’s grandma.

44:50.862 --> 44:52.994
Chomping the gummy bears
or whatever.

44:55.736 --> 44:58.130
I get it. Oh, I get it.

44:58.304 --> 44:59.609
I get it.

44:59.784 --> 45:01.655
It'’s the negative,
you know, the neg--

45:01.829 --> 45:03.875
I can do this. I can do this.

45:04.745 --> 45:05.746
Let me look at you.

45:07.487 --> 45:09.097
No. My God.

45:09.271 --> 45:10.882
You'’re, like, perfect.
Stand up.

45:12.144 --> 45:13.232
Stand up.

45:15.364 --> 45:16.714
Turn around. Turn around.

45:17.323 --> 45:19.107
Oh. No. Turn, quick.

45:19.281 --> 45:20.326
Okay.

45:21.588 --> 45:24.286
Sit down.
There must be something.

45:24.460 --> 45:25.635
- Show me your teeth.
- What?

45:25.810 --> 45:27.072
Let me see your teeth.
Come on. Show me.

45:27.246 --> 45:28.334
- Oh, there it is.
- What?

45:28.508 --> 45:29.509
- Look at that. Oh, my God.
- What?

45:29.683 --> 45:30.945
A snaggletooth.

45:31.119 --> 45:32.991
Oh, God, you could
eat corn through a fence.

45:33.165 --> 45:34.079
Oh!

45:34.253 --> 45:35.254
Yep, yep.

45:36.603 --> 45:37.735
Yeah.

45:37.909 --> 45:38.823
Hi, honey.

45:38.997 --> 45:40.433
Well, hi back to you.

45:40.607 --> 45:42.174
So, I wanted you to know,

45:42.348 --> 45:45.264
I-I sent you two versions
of the paper, A and B,

45:45.438 --> 45:48.006
and I want you to tell me
which one to go with. Okay?

45:48.180 --> 45:49.355
<i>No, I-I can'’t.</i>

45:49.529 --> 45:51.574
I'’m at a party
with a bunch of kids.

45:51.749 --> 45:53.838
I'’m-- I'’m 36. I'’m a man.[Mark] <i>Uh, what?</i>

45:54.012 --> 45:55.100
You'’re working on it.

45:55.274 --> 45:56.884
<i>I gotta go.</i> Uh--

45:57.580 --> 45:59.104
Uh, o-okay.

46:05.675 --> 46:07.025
Maura.

46:07.199 --> 46:08.504
Yeah? Hmm?

46:09.462 --> 46:11.116
Bet'’s to you, Maura.

46:12.857 --> 46:14.162
I'’ve been playing?

46:14.336 --> 46:16.164
No, you'’ve been killing it.

46:16.338 --> 46:17.513
Killing it.
Come on, Gugu.

46:17.687 --> 46:19.298
She'’s got
half the table on tilt.

46:19.472 --> 46:20.821
Every time she raises,

46:20.995 --> 46:22.127
she says she'’s gonna
take us to Flavortown,

46:22.301 --> 46:23.302
and then she--

46:23.476 --> 46:24.738
she nicknamed me "Brisket."

46:24.912 --> 46:26.392
You know what?
I shouldn'’t be here.

46:26.566 --> 46:27.959
I should leave
- I don'’t belong here.
- No, no, no.

46:28.133 --> 46:29.047
You gotta stay.

46:29.221 --> 46:30.352
- You got to.
- Yes.

46:30.526 --> 46:32.572
You are meant to be here.

46:32.746 --> 46:36.271
Sometimes fate puts you
exactly where
you supposed to be.

46:36.445 --> 46:37.533
It'’s your bet.

46:38.578 --> 46:40.101
Oh! Yeah, okay.

46:40.275 --> 46:41.276
Um...

46:42.321 --> 46:43.235
How much is this?

46:43.409 --> 46:44.540
Forty.[Maura] Okay.

46:44.714 --> 46:47.587
I'’ll, uh--
I'’ll raise you $40.

46:47.761 --> 46:49.023
Oh, wow. Really?

46:49.197 --> 46:50.633
It'’s 40,000.

46:51.678 --> 46:53.071
Right.

46:54.202 --> 46:55.508
Right.

46:56.117 --> 46:57.205
Okay.

46:57.945 --> 46:59.642
I'’ll raise you $40,000.

46:59.817 --> 47:01.775
I'’m already out.

47:01.949 --> 47:03.908
You are a shark,
aren'’t you, Maura?

47:04.082 --> 47:06.998
No, no.
My late husband loved gambling.

47:07.172 --> 47:09.696
And he would lose
every single time.

47:09.870 --> 47:11.437
I would win all the time,

47:11.611 --> 47:13.961
so I would slip
some of these chips
under his stack

47:14.135 --> 47:15.441
so he could keep on playing.

47:15.615 --> 47:17.269
That'’s a real
sweet story, but...

47:17.443 --> 47:19.184
Damn....flip '’em, Flavortown.

47:19.358 --> 47:20.620
Okay.

47:22.230 --> 47:24.537
Trip twos! Sorceress.

47:24.711 --> 47:25.930
Come on.[Brisket] Sorceress.

47:26.104 --> 47:27.540
Dark sorcery.

47:27.714 --> 47:29.107
Shut it, Brisket.

47:29.934 --> 47:31.326
Oh, shit.

47:31.500 --> 47:33.241
Any requests?

47:33.415 --> 47:34.808
Beastie Boys!

47:34.982 --> 47:38.681
Try "I Won'’t Dance"
in the original key of C.

47:38.856 --> 47:41.467
Ma'’am, we'’re not doing karaoke.

47:42.729 --> 47:43.861
My phone.

47:47.865 --> 47:48.866
Hello?

47:49.040 --> 47:51.259
Mom, did you call
the hospital?

47:52.565 --> 47:53.827
No, not yet.

47:54.001 --> 47:56.134
Mom, you need to call.
It'’s important.

47:56.308 --> 47:57.309
<i>Where are you?</i>

47:58.092 --> 48:00.007
Some Texas mansion.

48:00.181 --> 48:02.618
<i>But you said
you were in New Hampshire.</i>

48:02.792 --> 48:06.100
I'’m not. I'’m in Houston
for the Super Bowl.

48:06.274 --> 48:08.450
<i>The Super Bowl?
How did you afford that?</i>

48:08.624 --> 48:11.497
<i>It'’s fine.
Don'’t worry about it.</i>

48:11.671 --> 48:14.674
Wh-- What'’s going on?
Why are you lying to me?

48:14.848 --> 48:17.851
Everything'’s fine.
I had some tests done.

48:18.025 --> 48:20.027
They'’re calling me
to go over them.

48:20.201 --> 48:21.637
They mailed me the results.

48:21.811 --> 48:23.161
And?

48:23.335 --> 48:25.163
I haven'’t opened them yet.

48:25.337 --> 48:27.208
<i>What? Mom, open the letter.</i>

48:27.382 --> 48:28.253
No.

48:28.427 --> 48:29.863
What?

48:30.037 --> 48:32.910
Why does it matter?
What'’s another two days?

48:33.084 --> 48:35.173
This is something
I always wanted to do.

48:35.347 --> 48:40.439
To go to the Super Bowl
with my friends
and see Tom Brady win.

48:42.223 --> 48:45.009
So, no, I'’m not gonna
open that envelope.

48:45.183 --> 48:48.577
Because what'’s inside
could ruin this for everyone.

48:49.927 --> 48:51.754
Everyone. Where is--

48:53.495 --> 48:54.583
I gotta go.

48:54.757 --> 48:57.369
No, Mom. Mom?

48:57.543 --> 49:00.589
Has anyone seen Guy Ferrari?

49:00.763 --> 49:03.331
Uh, he looks like
a Flamin'’ Hot Cheeto.

49:05.290 --> 49:06.900
What is this place?

49:16.388 --> 49:17.302
Hi.

49:19.695 --> 49:21.959
I'’ll be right back.

49:22.133 --> 49:23.569
Lou, what'’s the matter?

49:24.396 --> 49:26.702
I got drugged by gummy bears.

49:26.876 --> 49:28.008
I should go. I should go.

49:28.182 --> 49:30.315
Maura and Betty are gone,

49:30.489 --> 49:32.186
and the tickets are missing.

49:32.360 --> 49:34.362
What?
What happened to the tickets?

49:35.015 --> 49:36.364
Hot sauce.

49:36.930 --> 49:38.410
Betty? Maura?

49:38.584 --> 49:40.281
How high are you, Lou?

49:40.847 --> 49:42.501
Substantially.

49:42.675 --> 49:45.330
Oh, okay.
What you thinkin'’, Maura?

49:45.504 --> 49:46.635
Wouldn'’t you like to know?

49:46.809 --> 49:47.985
Maura!

49:49.116 --> 49:50.291
Are you playing poker
right now?

49:50.465 --> 49:52.380
Yeah.
- Give me a sec, okay?
- Yeah.

49:53.555 --> 49:54.469
I have a great hand.

49:54.643 --> 49:55.688
We'’ve gotta go.

49:55.862 --> 49:57.733
- No!
- The tickets are lost!

49:57.907 --> 49:59.170
I know.

49:59.344 --> 50:02.086
But if I win this hand,
I can buy tickets.

50:02.912 --> 50:04.001
- Fine. Go beat him.
- Go!

50:04.175 --> 50:05.915
All right.[Gugu] All right, listen.

50:06.090 --> 50:08.657
I know that we'’ve been having
all of these beautiful moments,

50:08.831 --> 50:10.442
and I feel
very connected to you.

50:10.616 --> 50:12.183
All of the things.

50:12.357 --> 50:13.967
But now I'’ma have to
take all your money.

50:14.141 --> 50:16.317
- Mmm.
- All in.

50:16.491 --> 50:18.363
Okay.

50:19.625 --> 50:20.539
Me too.

50:21.931 --> 50:24.108
Oh.[Gugu] Well...

50:25.935 --> 50:27.502
Sha-blam!

50:27.676 --> 50:28.808
Oh, no.

50:28.982 --> 50:30.288
Wait for the river.

50:31.637 --> 50:32.855
Quad queens?

50:34.596 --> 50:36.511
Yes!
You did it! Yes!

50:36.685 --> 50:39.210
I'’m dead. I'’m totally dead.

50:40.167 --> 50:41.821
I'’m totally dead. Okay.

50:41.995 --> 50:43.475
Oh, my God.

50:43.649 --> 50:44.911
Oh, my God.

50:45.085 --> 50:46.217
You know what?

50:46.391 --> 50:48.480
I think I'’m gonna
cash out. Okay.

50:48.654 --> 50:50.438
Great. What charity
are you playing for?

50:53.311 --> 50:55.878
It'’s a charity poker event.

50:56.053 --> 50:57.358
Oh, my God.

50:58.925 --> 51:00.622
-  Charity.
- Right.

51:01.188 --> 51:02.146
Uh, Gugu?

51:02.320 --> 51:03.930
- Mmm?
- What'’s your charity?

51:04.104 --> 51:05.584
Broadway Cares.

51:05.758 --> 51:08.065
Give all of my winnings
to Broadway Cares.

51:08.239 --> 51:11.677
And I wanna thank everybody
for letting me play with you.

51:11.851 --> 51:15.028
I had a fabulous time.

51:15.202 --> 51:17.639
Ugh. Charity poker.

51:17.813 --> 51:19.815
I wasn'’t gonna wear
a retainer for 18 months.

51:19.989 --> 51:20.903
Right.

51:21.078 --> 51:22.688
Doctor Wong was right,

51:22.862 --> 51:24.559
and the teeth just
went right back to
where they started.

51:24.733 --> 51:26.387
Oh, gosh, that'’s terrible.

51:26.561 --> 51:30.087
Well, you gotta roll
with the punches, you know.

51:30.261 --> 51:31.740
It'’s--

51:31.914 --> 51:33.177
You don'’t understand
how hard dating is these days.

51:33.351 --> 51:35.744
Oh, I can imagine.
I can imagine.

51:35.918 --> 51:37.659
But let me just tell you this.

51:37.833 --> 51:40.836
Listen to me right now.

51:41.010 --> 51:43.187
If you wanna find love...

51:43.361 --> 51:48.061
...you have to focus
on the positive,
not the negative.

51:48.235 --> 51:50.455
There'’s always negative things.

51:50.629 --> 51:55.199
Honestly, if you see someone
you think is interesting,

51:55.373 --> 51:57.592
you look them
right in the face,

51:58.245 --> 51:59.551
and you say...

52:02.423 --> 52:04.425
"I like the way you look."

52:06.035 --> 52:07.776
Oh, no, not me![Lou] You too?

52:07.950 --> 52:09.735
What are you doing?

52:09.909 --> 52:11.954
I don'’t know.
I don'’t know what I'’m doing.

52:12.129 --> 52:14.740
- That'’s the problem.
- It'’s 1:00 a.m.

52:14.914 --> 52:17.482
Does nobody care that
we don'’t have the tickets?

52:17.656 --> 52:18.744
Lou, Lou, relax.

52:18.918 --> 52:20.180
Oh, relax.

52:20.354 --> 52:22.182
I should be relaxed
and in bed right now,

52:22.356 --> 52:25.316
but I'’m not because
you'’re too busy gambling.

52:25.490 --> 52:28.406
And you care more about
some guy you just met

52:28.580 --> 52:30.321
than you do your friends.

52:30.495 --> 52:32.975
And you should be
more responsible,

52:33.150 --> 52:35.848
but clearly
you don'’t give a damn.

52:36.022 --> 52:39.112
I give a damn. I give a damn.
We'’ll find the tickets.

52:39.286 --> 52:41.897
When? Tomorrow'’s the game.

52:42.071 --> 52:45.205
Use that big brain of yours.

52:45.379 --> 52:47.076
I thought you were
supposed to be the smart one.

52:47.251 --> 52:48.513
What'’s going on?

52:48.687 --> 52:51.820
No one knows how much
this trip means to me.

52:52.778 --> 52:55.215
Well, that'’s just selfish.

52:55.389 --> 52:56.999
It means a lot to all of us.

52:57.174 --> 53:00.046
You know, I'’m tired.

53:13.799 --> 53:16.062
We'’re gonna find
the tickets tomorrow.

53:16.236 --> 53:19.239
We'’re gonna go to the hotel,
get a good night'’s sleep,

53:19.413 --> 53:21.937
and wake up all fresh.

53:27.682 --> 53:29.554
<i>Good morning
from Houston, Texas.</i>

53:29.728 --> 53:33.949
<i>It'’s Super Bowl Sunday,
February 5, 2017,</i>

53:34.123 --> 53:36.474
<i>the biggest stage in sports.</i>

53:36.648 --> 53:38.998
<i>Patriots. Falcons.</i>

53:39.172 --> 53:40.652
<i>Two storied franchises,</i>

53:40.826 --> 53:42.480
<i>two inevitable fates, one--</i>

53:47.441 --> 53:49.226
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.

53:51.489 --> 53:52.490
Oh, my God, my head.

53:52.664 --> 53:55.014
We all g--
We have to get up.

53:55.188 --> 53:56.972
We have to find our tickets.

53:57.146 --> 53:59.497
- I don'’t wanna get up.
- Oh. Oh, God.

53:59.671 --> 54:03.501
Why is champagne
such a violent beverage?

54:03.675 --> 54:04.632
Shoot.

54:05.590 --> 54:06.852
Lou, I'’m sorry.

54:07.026 --> 54:08.636
It'’s my fault
as much as anybody'’s.

54:08.810 --> 54:10.682
Come on. The game
doesn'’t start for a few hours.

54:10.856 --> 54:12.031
We'’ll get tickets.

54:12.205 --> 54:14.120
There'’s gotta be
a scalper somewhere.

54:14.294 --> 54:16.862
All right. Let'’s meet
back here in an hour
in front of the stadium.

54:17.036 --> 54:18.342
We'’ll all split up.

54:18.516 --> 54:19.430
- Okay. Hour.
- In an hour.

54:19.604 --> 54:20.561
In an hour.

54:32.225 --> 54:33.444
Do you--

54:33.618 --> 54:35.794
Do you know where
I could find a scalper?

54:35.968 --> 54:38.579
- I don'’t think I can.
- Okay, okay, okay. Got it.

54:39.841 --> 54:41.278
Hey. Has anybody got tickets?

54:41.452 --> 54:43.323
Okay, sorry. Sorry.

54:43.802 --> 54:44.846
Shit.

54:59.992 --> 55:01.167
You a scalper?

55:01.341 --> 55:02.560
No.

55:02.734 --> 55:03.648
You a cop?

55:03.822 --> 55:06.477
No. How much for four tickets?

55:06.651 --> 55:07.826
Ten thousand.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.262
Ten thousand?

55:09.436 --> 55:10.655
Per ticket.

55:10.829 --> 55:12.004
I'’ll tell you what.

55:12.178 --> 55:15.224
I'’m willing to go
100 per ticket.

55:15.399 --> 55:16.356
That'’s less than face value.

55:16.530 --> 55:17.575
175.

55:17.749 --> 55:20.099
Move on.
I gotta find a real buyer.

55:20.273 --> 55:21.709
- Will 200 happen?
- No.

55:21.883 --> 55:24.277
You'’re not gonna accept
250 cash in hand?

55:24.451 --> 55:26.105
What is wrong with you?

55:26.279 --> 55:28.237
- I'’m offering 300.
- No.

55:28.412 --> 55:30.022
- 450.
- No.

55:30.196 --> 55:32.590
500 is my ceiling.
It'’s my ceiling.

55:32.764 --> 55:34.548
525.

55:34.722 --> 55:35.810
Come on. Get outta here. No.

55:35.984 --> 55:37.464
You know what?

55:37.638 --> 55:41.033
When you are stuck at halftime
with those tickets,

55:41.207 --> 55:45.167
I'’m gonna lowball
the shit outta you,
you son of a bitch.

55:47.779 --> 55:48.736
550.

55:48.910 --> 55:50.782
If my bookie were listening,

55:50.956 --> 55:53.654
I would tell him
to put me down for,
like, five large...

55:53.828 --> 55:56.744
Whoa....that the Pats
take it by 14.

55:56.918 --> 55:58.790
All right? But I don'’t
have a bookie, so--Right.

55:58.964 --> 56:00.531
Well, hey,
you heard him, Mike.

56:00.705 --> 56:02.141
You heard that.
We'’re gonna be right back.

56:02.315 --> 56:03.795
Stick around.

56:03.969 --> 56:06.754
You can'’t blow up Mike
like that on the show.

56:06.928 --> 56:08.408
- Excuse me.
- Hey.

56:08.582 --> 56:11.193
Yeah--
We know each other, right?

56:11.368 --> 56:12.499
God, you look very familiar.

56:14.283 --> 56:15.807
Well, I was
- the Mayflower Girl.
- That'’s it.

56:15.981 --> 56:17.504
- Yeah, you were!
- Oh, my God!

56:17.678 --> 56:19.245
From the commercials
- when we were kids.
- Yeah, I know.

56:19.419 --> 56:22.248
<i>♪ Tires, parts
And new cars too♪</i>

56:22.422 --> 56:23.597
<i>♪ We got it all-- ♪</i>

56:23.771 --> 56:25.512
Are you gonna do
the whole thing?

56:25.686 --> 56:28.341
I had a humongous thing for you
when I was about ten.

56:28.515 --> 56:30.299
All right.
- Too much. Too much.
- Thank you.

56:30.474 --> 56:32.519
That'’s very kind. Thank you.

56:33.259 --> 56:34.608
Actually, I need your help.

56:34.782 --> 56:36.567
See, my friend won
the tickets at your giveaway,

56:36.741 --> 56:38.395
and now we'’ve lost them.

56:38.569 --> 56:39.787
Uh... I don'’t--

56:39.961 --> 56:41.267
Your-- Your friend
won the ticket giveaway?

56:41.441 --> 56:43.095
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, I don'’t--

56:43.269 --> 56:46.011
'’Cause these guys
won the tickets.[Pat] Yeah.

56:46.185 --> 56:47.012
They won the tickets?

56:47.186 --> 56:48.361
Yeah.[Nat] Uh-huh.

56:48.535 --> 56:50.276
That'’s the Tom Brady
Support Group.

56:50.450 --> 56:51.669
They support Tom Brady?

56:51.843 --> 56:54.585
No. They'’re all men
named Tom Brady

56:54.759 --> 56:56.238
who formed a support group

56:56.413 --> 56:58.110
because they'’re never gonna
live up to that name.

56:58.284 --> 56:59.677
Are they even Pats fans?

56:59.851 --> 57:01.766
They'’re conflicted
about it, let'’s say.

57:01.940 --> 57:03.463
They seem reluctantly
- like they'’re supporting '’em.
- Yeah. Yeah.

57:03.637 --> 57:04.943
Yeah. They came.

57:05.117 --> 57:07.032
Oh.

57:07.815 --> 57:08.903
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

57:10.731 --> 57:12.429
Hi, sweetie.

57:12.603 --> 57:14.213
<i>Okay, I was trying not to
bother you too much,</i>

57:14.387 --> 57:15.954
<i>but, uh, which one?</i>

57:16.128 --> 57:17.303
What?

57:17.477 --> 57:19.218
I sent you an e-mail
with two options.

57:19.392 --> 57:20.306
A or B?

57:20.480 --> 57:22.177
What are you talking about?

57:22.351 --> 57:23.527
<i>My paper.</i>

57:23.701 --> 57:25.877
Oh. Oh, I didn'’t read it.

57:26.051 --> 57:28.880
Are-- Are you close
to a computer?
Can you find a Kinko'’s?

57:29.054 --> 57:30.751
No. No, I--

57:30.925 --> 57:32.666
I am not going to read it.

57:34.320 --> 57:36.148
Well, are you just hungry?

57:36.322 --> 57:38.063
<i>No, for God'’s sakes, Mark.</i>

57:38.237 --> 57:41.370
I'’m not hungry.
I'’m at the Super Bowl
with my friends.

57:41.545 --> 57:43.503
<i>But this is really important.</i>

57:43.677 --> 57:46.985
To you it is.
To you. Not to me.

57:47.159 --> 57:50.467
Honestly, it'’s your paper
with your name on it.

57:50.641 --> 57:52.294
You have to make the decisions.

57:56.385 --> 57:57.778
Mark, are you still there?

57:59.954 --> 58:01.390
Yeah.

58:01.565 --> 58:02.566
<i>Listen.</i>

58:03.392 --> 58:04.785
<i>Honey, I--</i>

58:04.959 --> 58:06.744
I have made a lot of sacrifices
over the years,

58:06.918 --> 58:10.225
and I'’m not saying I wish
I could change any of that.

58:10.399 --> 58:14.012
I'’m just saying just because
I can solve a problem

58:14.186 --> 58:16.405
does not mean I should have to.

58:18.407 --> 58:19.452
Okay.

58:22.586 --> 58:23.935
I love our life.

58:24.109 --> 58:26.154
I love our kids
and our grandkids.

58:26.764 --> 58:27.765
I love you.

58:29.767 --> 58:31.116
I love you too.

58:31.290 --> 58:33.814
<i>I'’m sorry. Have a great time.</i>

58:33.988 --> 58:34.989
Okay.

58:35.163 --> 58:36.382
<i>Okay.</i> Okay.

58:43.650 --> 58:46.871
Found it! I found it!
I found it! I found it!

58:47.045 --> 58:50.004
What can I get for you?[chuckles] Oh, is--
is Guy here?

58:50.178 --> 58:51.963
- Oh, damn. It'’s you.
- Hi.

58:52.137 --> 58:53.834
- How are you?
- Good.

58:54.008 --> 58:55.270
How'’s your bowels?

58:55.444 --> 58:57.621
That'’s none
- of your business.
- Okay.

58:57.795 --> 58:59.144
I haven'’t seen Guy in a while.

58:59.318 --> 59:00.493
I think he might be
in the office.

59:00.667 --> 59:02.016
Where'’s the office?

59:05.367 --> 59:06.499
Good luck.

59:06.673 --> 59:08.153
Mr. Fieri.

59:08.327 --> 59:10.634
Mr. Fieri? Mr. Fieri--

59:10.808 --> 59:13.158
-  Oh, hi.
- Oh, God. Sorry.

59:13.332 --> 59:14.812
Mr. Fieri?

59:14.986 --> 59:16.553
Mr. Fieri?

59:16.727 --> 59:17.728
Mr. Fieri?

59:18.729 --> 59:20.034
Guy!

59:20.208 --> 59:21.296
Yeah?

59:21.470 --> 59:23.298
Oh, thank God. Thank God.

59:23.472 --> 59:26.432
Mr. Fieri, I'’m sorry,
I think you have my strap-on.

59:26.606 --> 59:28.129
Hang-- Hang on a second.

59:29.174 --> 59:31.045
Oh. Oh, thank God.

59:31.219 --> 59:32.307
Oh, Betty, it'’s you.

59:32.481 --> 59:33.526
I was expecting
someone else.

59:33.700 --> 59:35.789
No. I think
you have my strap-on.

59:35.963 --> 59:39.445
You know, I took off
during the competition.

59:42.274 --> 59:43.405
- Your fanny pack.
- Yes.

59:43.580 --> 59:45.494
- Your fanny pack.
- Yes. It went this way.

59:45.669 --> 59:49.281
So you don'’t have any tickets
to get into the actual game?

59:49.455 --> 59:51.544
No. No,
the tickets are lost.

59:51.718 --> 59:53.328
Did you try the lost and found?

59:53.502 --> 59:55.243
- No, no. Where is that?
- Okay.

59:55.417 --> 59:56.941
Um...

59:57.115 --> 59:59.639
I don'’t know,
- actually, where that is.
- Oh, G--

59:59.813 --> 1:00:02.076
There'’s got to be some way.

1:00:02.250 --> 1:00:05.340
If you don'’t have the tickets,
then you don'’t have a--

1:00:05.514 --> 1:00:07.212
<i>It'’s one of those moments</i>

1:00:07.386 --> 1:00:09.040
<i>where all the work
that you put in</i>

1:00:09.214 --> 1:00:10.258
<i>has brought you
to this moment.</i>

1:00:10.432 --> 1:00:11.695
<i>And it'’s okay to be behind,</i>

1:00:11.869 --> 1:00:13.087
<i>'’cause you gotta
remind yourself</i>

1:00:13.261 --> 1:00:14.785
<i>that it'’s all gonna work out.</i>

1:00:14.959 --> 1:00:17.309
No, Tom. I don'’t think
it'’s going to work out.

1:00:17.483 --> 1:00:18.919
They'’re not going to let us in.

1:00:19.703 --> 1:00:21.748
<i>Lou, whenever I'’m down,</i>

1:00:21.922 --> 1:00:23.271
<i>I say to myself,</i>

1:00:23.445 --> 1:00:26.710
<i>"This is going to be
an amazing comeback.</i>

1:00:26.884 --> 1:00:28.668
<i>When we come back from this,</i>

1:00:28.842 --> 1:00:31.540
<i>this is going to be
a defining moment in my life."</i>

1:00:31.715 --> 1:00:34.413
<i>You have to shift your mind
to think that way.</i>

1:00:34.587 --> 1:00:35.893
<i>It'’s empowering.</i>

1:00:36.067 --> 1:00:37.242
<i>Say it.</i>

1:00:37.416 --> 1:00:39.766
<i>This is going to work out.</i>

1:00:42.029 --> 1:00:43.204
This is gonna work out.

1:00:43.378 --> 1:00:45.163
<i>Come on, Lou.
Like you mean it.</i>

1:00:45.337 --> 1:00:47.121
<i>This is going to work out.</i>

1:00:47.295 --> 1:00:50.124
This is gonna work out!

1:00:53.562 --> 1:00:55.042
- Lou! Lou!
- Oh, my God.

1:00:55.216 --> 1:00:56.653
I found them!
I found them.

1:00:56.827 --> 1:00:59.351
We got the tickets!
We got the tickets!

1:00:59.525 --> 1:01:00.918
- We got the tickets.
- You got the tickets.

1:01:01.092 --> 1:01:02.267
- I got '’em.
- Oh, my God!

1:01:02.441 --> 1:01:04.008
- I got '’em!
- Oh, my God!

1:01:04.182 --> 1:01:06.053
Oh,
- we got to go in now.
- Isn'’t that great?

1:01:06.227 --> 1:01:08.316
Now. Come on.
- Let'’s go.
- Yeah, great. Oh, my God.

1:01:08.490 --> 1:01:09.709
Games, everybody.
Everybody have a ticket?

1:01:09.883 --> 1:01:11.363
- Everybody take their ticket.
- Come on.

1:01:11.537 --> 1:01:14.018
We'’ve got our tickets.
We'’ve got our tickets.

1:01:14.975 --> 1:01:17.151
Oh, my God. This is it.

1:01:19.676 --> 1:01:21.112
- We did it.
- We did do this.

1:01:22.287 --> 1:01:23.680
Next. Come on.

1:01:25.029 --> 1:01:26.465
- Hi, welcome.
- Hi.

1:01:28.380 --> 1:01:30.251
Oh. Uh...

1:01:30.425 --> 1:01:33.167
Are you guys all together?
This is--

1:01:33.341 --> 1:01:35.213
These aren'’t-- These--

1:01:35.387 --> 1:01:37.476
I'’m sorry, these all
aren'’t Super Bowl tickets, so--

1:01:37.650 --> 1:01:39.478
Yes, those are our tickets.

1:01:39.652 --> 1:01:41.480
That'’s great, but
they'’re not Super Bowl tickets.

1:01:41.654 --> 1:01:43.482
Chip,
- I got another one here.
- Comin'’.

1:01:43.656 --> 1:01:45.266
Hot one.[Chip] Let me see.

1:01:45.440 --> 1:01:47.486
Four.

1:01:48.617 --> 1:01:50.619
- Yep, they'’re fake.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

1:01:50.794 --> 1:01:52.970
You see, ladies,
the official tickets
have a hologram

1:01:53.144 --> 1:01:55.189
that lights up under UV light.

1:01:55.363 --> 1:01:57.496
These do not.
You'’ve been scammed.

1:01:57.670 --> 1:02:00.281
Well, that'’s not possible.
We won them in a contest.

1:02:00.455 --> 1:02:01.761
No, we didn'’t.

1:02:01.935 --> 1:02:03.110
Lou, tell '’em.

1:02:09.160 --> 1:02:10.944
I never won the contest.

1:02:11.118 --> 1:02:13.686
A whole bunch
of Tom Brady wannabes did.

1:02:13.860 --> 1:02:15.732
How'’d you get the tickets?

1:02:16.776 --> 1:02:18.212
I bought them online.

1:02:19.823 --> 1:02:23.522
I maxed out a credit card,
and I sold my car to CarMax.

1:02:24.871 --> 1:02:27.004
Oh, Lou,
why would you do that?

1:02:29.049 --> 1:02:33.010
I wanted to have one last
unforgettable experience

1:02:34.141 --> 1:02:35.839
before it was too late.

1:02:36.013 --> 1:02:38.232
Hey, little ladies,
I'’m gonna need you
to move aside.

1:02:38.406 --> 1:02:39.886
We gotta let other people
through the gate.

1:02:40.060 --> 1:02:41.801
Well, you can start by
letting us through.

1:02:41.975 --> 1:02:43.672
- Oh, you'’re not getting in.
- Oh!

1:02:43.847 --> 1:02:46.066
Wha--[Trish] Oh.

1:02:46.240 --> 1:02:47.589
When you do a double,
- they get thick.
- I got you.

1:02:47.764 --> 1:02:48.808
Let'’s make a run.

1:02:48.982 --> 1:02:49.940
- Whoa. No.
- Hey. Wait.

1:02:50.114 --> 1:02:52.203
- Maura. No.
- Come on, ma'’am.

1:02:52.377 --> 1:02:54.596
- No, no. She-- Come on.
- Come on. I'’m not hurting her.
I am not hurting her.

1:02:54.771 --> 1:02:55.859
- We know you'’re not.
- Don'’t touch me!

1:02:56.033 --> 1:02:57.338
- She'’s coming at me.
- Come on.

1:02:57.512 --> 1:02:59.253
Okay. Fine, fine, fine.

1:03:01.690 --> 1:03:03.388
Lou, where are you going?

1:03:03.562 --> 1:03:07.218
Louella, talk to us.
What is going on?

1:03:09.829 --> 1:03:10.830
Lou, look at me.

1:03:12.049 --> 1:03:13.615
What did you mean
when you said

1:03:15.182 --> 1:03:16.793
"before it'’s too late"?

1:03:21.319 --> 1:03:22.668
I had some tests done,

1:03:22.842 --> 1:03:24.801
and the hospital'’s been
trying to reach me.

1:03:27.194 --> 1:03:29.370
I think maybe
something came up.

1:03:30.371 --> 1:03:31.329
Oh, Lou.

1:03:31.503 --> 1:03:33.200
What did they say?

1:03:33.374 --> 1:03:34.767
I don'’t know, I--

1:03:34.941 --> 1:03:36.421
They sent me a letter,
but I haven'’t opened it.

1:03:36.595 --> 1:03:37.552
Well, open it.

1:03:37.726 --> 1:03:39.032
No, what if it'’s come back?

1:03:39.206 --> 1:03:41.295
I-- I can'’t
go through that again.

1:03:47.780 --> 1:03:50.261
Oh, Lou.
You'’re not alone.

1:03:50.435 --> 1:03:52.437
We'’re here for you. Always.

1:03:52.611 --> 1:03:55.005
We'’re all here
to support you.

1:03:56.354 --> 1:03:57.877
Isn'’t that
what friendship is?

1:03:58.051 --> 1:03:59.487
I mean,

1:03:59.661 --> 1:04:03.230
that we face
the unknown together,
hand in hand?

1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:11.804
I wouldn'’t wanna go through it
with anyone else.

1:04:11.978 --> 1:04:13.632
I really love you all.

1:04:22.467 --> 1:04:24.904
I guess maybe this Super Bowl
was never meant to be.

1:04:25.078 --> 1:04:26.906
Oh, come on, Lou.

1:04:27.080 --> 1:04:29.213
If you did this to give us
something to remember,

1:04:29.387 --> 1:04:31.432
honey, it worked.

1:04:31.606 --> 1:04:32.607
Big time.

1:04:32.781 --> 1:04:34.348
We will always remember this.

1:04:34.522 --> 1:04:36.220
Absolutely.

1:04:36.394 --> 1:04:40.441
This has been
the best weekend
of my whole life.

1:04:40.615 --> 1:04:42.835
I'’m not kidding you.
The very, very best.

1:04:43.749 --> 1:04:45.577
Well, except for
the guilt I felt

1:04:45.751 --> 1:04:47.666
because I lost the tickets,
which were fake.

1:04:47.840 --> 1:04:51.496
And so, in retrospect,
I didn'’t have to feel
that guilty. Did I?

1:04:56.718 --> 1:04:59.243
Oh, hell.
There must be a sports bar
around here somewhere.

1:04:59.417 --> 1:05:01.854
No, no.
No, no, no, no. God.

1:05:03.029 --> 1:05:05.902
There'’s got to be
a way into that stadium.

1:05:06.076 --> 1:05:07.425
Come on.
We'’re not gonna give up.

1:05:07.599 --> 1:05:08.992
We'’ve come too far.

1:05:09.166 --> 1:05:11.342
No, we are not gonna
stand around this food court,

1:05:11.516 --> 1:05:13.735
crying like
a bunch of babies.

1:05:13.910 --> 1:05:17.087
- Gugu.
- Yeah. Goo-goo, gaga.

1:05:17.261 --> 1:05:18.218
No.

1:05:18.392 --> 1:05:19.524
Gugu!

1:05:19.698 --> 1:05:20.655
- Hold on.
- Gugu. Hi.

1:05:20.829 --> 1:05:22.309
- Hey.
- Come on. Come on.

1:05:22.483 --> 1:05:24.007
Maura. How are you, ladies?

1:05:24.181 --> 1:05:25.965
- Y'’all look fabulous.
- Thank you.

1:05:26.139 --> 1:05:27.619
I wanted to thank you properly
for last night,

1:05:27.793 --> 1:05:28.750
but you ran out so fast.

1:05:28.925 --> 1:05:30.143
Y'’all ran out.

1:05:30.317 --> 1:05:32.319
Your donation was so beautiful.
Thank you.

1:05:32.493 --> 1:05:34.495
You'’re welcome.
I was happy to do it.

1:05:34.669 --> 1:05:36.628
Are you, um...
Are you going into the game?

1:05:36.802 --> 1:05:37.890
Of course.

1:05:38.064 --> 1:05:39.326
I choreographed
the halftime show.

1:05:39.500 --> 1:05:42.199
Oh, you'’re--
You work with Lady Gaga?

1:05:42.373 --> 1:05:43.635
I do everything
with that girl.

1:05:43.809 --> 1:05:45.724
Where you think
she got her name from?

1:05:45.898 --> 1:05:48.770
I'’m Gugu, she'’s Gaga.

1:05:48.945 --> 1:05:51.121
- Oh, she'’s spectacular.
- She is.

1:05:51.295 --> 1:05:53.036
Do you think
you could get us in?

1:05:53.210 --> 1:05:54.515
Uh, yeah,
we don'’t have tickets.

1:05:57.910 --> 1:05:59.651
Come on, ladies. Follow me.

1:05:59.825 --> 1:06:02.045
- Go, go, go.
- Come on.

1:06:04.047 --> 1:06:06.527
- Hey, there. How are ya?
- Doin'’ all right.

1:06:06.701 --> 1:06:08.877
Hold on.
- Let me see your badges.
- No. No.

1:06:09.052 --> 1:06:11.880
They'’re with me. They'’re good.
These are my dancers.

1:06:12.055 --> 1:06:13.578
They don'’t
look like dancers.

1:06:13.752 --> 1:06:15.928
Well, that'’s ageist.
Isn'’t it?

1:06:16.102 --> 1:06:17.321
I don'’t care
how old they are.

1:06:17.495 --> 1:06:19.279
They just need badges
like these dancers.

1:06:19.453 --> 1:06:20.977
Holy shit.[Trish] Flexible.

1:06:21.151 --> 1:06:23.892
Well, uh,
they'’re all my dancers.

1:06:24.067 --> 1:06:26.721
I mean... [scoffs] What?
You want us to show you?

1:06:27.548 --> 1:06:28.593
Okay.

1:06:29.681 --> 1:06:32.031
Okay. Um...
Y'’all got this. Come on.

1:06:32.205 --> 1:06:33.641
Come on. Let'’s talk
about this for a second.

1:06:34.338 --> 1:06:35.687
Okay. Um...

1:06:35.861 --> 1:06:37.994
So what are some dance moves
you ladies know?

1:06:38.168 --> 1:06:39.865
- The twist.
- Twist.

1:06:40.039 --> 1:06:41.562
The jerk.[Lou] Sh-- Shimmy.

1:06:41.736 --> 1:06:43.782
Yeah, uh, step-touch.

1:06:43.956 --> 1:06:47.916
All right.
So we'’ll do the step-touch,
the twist, the shimmy,

1:06:48.091 --> 1:06:49.396
and then we'’ll end
with some jazz hands.

1:06:49.570 --> 1:06:50.441
- How'’s that?
- Oh, yeah.

1:06:50.615 --> 1:06:51.529
Okay?[Trish] Yes.

1:06:51.703 --> 1:06:53.052
One, two, three.[all] Break!

1:06:53.226 --> 1:06:54.358
All right. Let'’s do it.

1:06:55.881 --> 1:06:58.101
Y'’all ready?
A little freestyle here.

1:07:00.581 --> 1:07:03.062
And five, six, seven.

1:07:03.236 --> 1:07:06.326
<i>♪ It'’s my--
And I live here♪</i>

1:07:08.154 --> 1:07:10.765
<i>♪ It'’s my house and I-- ♪</i>

1:07:10.939 --> 1:07:12.071
There you go.

1:07:12.245 --> 1:07:13.551
Oh!

1:07:22.255 --> 1:07:23.996
Oh! And...

1:07:24.170 --> 1:07:25.519
Freestyle, ladies.

1:07:26.433 --> 1:07:29.045
Freestyle, ladies.
Come on down.

1:07:33.005 --> 1:07:34.789
Y'’all did so good!

1:07:35.616 --> 1:07:38.402
Five, six, seven and hold!

1:07:43.015 --> 1:07:44.408
Damn, ladies.

1:07:44.582 --> 1:07:46.584
Those were
some sick dance moves.

1:07:46.758 --> 1:07:50.283
I know you'’re not his dancers,
but that was awesome.

1:07:51.589 --> 1:07:52.503
Go ahead.

1:07:53.808 --> 1:07:55.332
Extraordinary!

1:07:55.506 --> 1:07:58.117
We have to go to work.
- It'’s been lovely.
- Okay.

1:07:58.291 --> 1:08:01.164
Y'’all better fluff up
'’cause these ladies
are about to take your gig.

1:08:01.338 --> 1:08:02.339
Come on, kids!

1:08:02.513 --> 1:08:03.514
-  Thank you.
- Let'’s go.

1:08:03.688 --> 1:08:05.472
- Yo, how good were they?
- Amazing.

1:08:05.646 --> 1:08:06.821
Good lord.

1:08:38.157 --> 1:08:41.117
<i>In three, two, one!</i>

1:08:55.174 --> 1:08:56.915
Okay, where to?

1:08:57.089 --> 1:08:58.438
Um...

1:08:58.612 --> 1:09:01.485
Oh! Oh!
Empty seats right there.

1:09:01.659 --> 1:09:02.834
- Let'’s go up there.
- Yeah.

1:09:03.008 --> 1:09:04.401
- All right.
- Super Bowl 51.

1:09:04.575 --> 1:09:08.622
Pats Nation,
welcome to Super Bowl LI.Welcome.

1:09:10.537 --> 1:09:12.931
<i>There'’s the kickoff
and we are underway.</i>

1:09:13.105 --> 1:09:15.412
- It'’s Tom. It'’s Tom.
- Okay. Where?

1:09:16.500 --> 1:09:18.371
Do our job now.
Let'’s do our job!

1:09:18.545 --> 1:09:22.984
I think this is
the best sitting down
has ever felt.

1:09:28.729 --> 1:09:30.470
<i>Third and long.
Tom Brady'’s in the--</i>

1:09:30.644 --> 1:09:32.733
<i>Oh, God! He'’s sacked.</i>[Nat] <i>God.</i>

1:09:32.907 --> 1:09:34.648
What the hell was that?

1:09:34.822 --> 1:09:36.824
<i>We are still scoreless
in the first quarter.</i>

1:09:41.438 --> 1:09:42.830
Who keeps texting you?

1:09:43.483 --> 1:09:45.006
Oh, it'’s-- it'’s Dan.

1:09:46.007 --> 1:09:47.705
Well, why-- why
don'’t you answer him?

1:09:49.315 --> 1:09:51.230
I don'’t know.
I'’m ghosting him.

1:09:52.013 --> 1:09:53.580
You know, he keeps calling...

1:09:59.195 --> 1:10:00.631
...but I know
how this works out.

1:10:00.805 --> 1:10:01.806
He'’s--

1:10:03.068 --> 1:10:05.592
He'’s gonna be charming,
I'’m gonna fall for it.

1:10:05.766 --> 1:10:07.203
It'’s gonna all move too fast,

1:10:07.377 --> 1:10:10.206
and then everything'’s gonna
come crashing down.

1:10:10.380 --> 1:10:14.471
You realize ignoring him
is just gonna make him
want you more?

1:10:14.645 --> 1:10:17.300
I mean, look at you.
Honestly, and who you are.

1:10:17.474 --> 1:10:20.303
You'’re always
pushing forward
and doing new things.

1:10:20.477 --> 1:10:22.218
Well... You'’re irresistible.

1:10:22.392 --> 1:10:24.829
You know, honestly,
I don'’t want to be.

1:10:25.003 --> 1:10:26.831
I don'’t wanna be irresistible.

1:10:27.005 --> 1:10:29.312
I'’d like five grandkids
like you have.

1:10:30.704 --> 1:10:33.229
Guess it'’s a little late
- for that.
- Yeah, I guess so.

1:10:33.403 --> 1:10:36.971
I want a man I can sit next to
and not have to talk.

1:10:37.145 --> 1:10:39.757
Well, you can have Mark.
He'’s real good at that.

1:10:39.931 --> 1:10:41.933
Well, I'’d take him,

1:10:42.107 --> 1:10:43.935
but he'’s too much
in love with you.

1:10:44.109 --> 1:10:46.677
Look, that'’s us!
Oh, my God!

1:10:50.985 --> 1:10:52.248
Yay, yay, yay!

1:10:52.422 --> 1:10:56.513
Tom Brady, we love you!
Look down there.

1:10:56.687 --> 1:10:59.559
<i>Let'’s hear it for
our Super Bowl superfans!</i>

1:10:59.733 --> 1:11:02.040
<i>My goodness,
I wish I had those hips.</i>

1:11:02.214 --> 1:11:04.869
Not on me, not on my watch!

1:11:05.043 --> 1:11:06.914
...never been so--
- Sit down.
- Tom, spank me.

1:11:07.088 --> 1:11:09.787
Right here.
Spank me here, Tom.[Betty] Oh, no. Get, get--

1:11:10.918 --> 1:11:13.530
Sit down. Oh, my God.
I'’m so embarrassed.

1:11:13.704 --> 1:11:15.706
The Falcons have no business
being in this contest.

1:11:15.880 --> 1:11:18.099
<i>I mean,
it'’s gonna be a bloodbath.</i>

1:11:18.274 --> 1:11:20.014
<i>Oh, come on!
Get him! Get him!</i>

1:11:20.188 --> 1:11:21.929
<i>Damn it!</i>

1:11:22.103 --> 1:11:23.801
<i>Atlanta with the first
touchdown of the game.</i> Nice!

1:11:23.975 --> 1:11:25.846
<i>Bryant, the extra point.</i>

1:11:26.020 --> 1:11:27.413
<i>7-nothing to Atlanta.</i>

1:11:28.806 --> 1:11:29.981
Hey!

1:11:30.155 --> 1:11:31.069
Let'’s go.

1:11:31.243 --> 1:11:33.506
Out of the seats. Now.

1:11:35.116 --> 1:11:36.466
Come on.

1:11:36.640 --> 1:11:38.555
Let'’s go, Golden Girls.
Let'’s do this.

1:11:38.729 --> 1:11:41.253
Now, I don'’t know how you ladies
got into this stadium,

1:11:41.427 --> 1:11:43.081
but I know
how you'’re getting out.

1:11:43.255 --> 1:11:44.169
Chip.

1:11:44.343 --> 1:11:45.257
Oh, God.

1:11:45.431 --> 1:11:46.476
Trish?

1:11:47.259 --> 1:11:48.173
Dan.

1:11:48.347 --> 1:11:50.001
I saw you on the Jumbotron.

1:11:50.175 --> 1:11:51.611
You weren'’t answering my texts.

1:11:52.873 --> 1:11:55.180
I was--
I was very preoccupied.

1:11:55.354 --> 1:11:56.616
Dan O'’Callahan?

1:11:58.705 --> 1:12:01.491
When you caught
that 90-yard touchdown
pass against the Oilers!

1:12:01.665 --> 1:12:02.883
Poetry.

1:12:03.057 --> 1:12:05.625
I mean, devastating for me
as an Oilers fan

1:12:05.799 --> 1:12:07.497
- but poetry.
- Thank you.

1:12:07.671 --> 1:12:09.847
- Dan, he'’s kicking us out.
- What?

1:12:10.021 --> 1:12:11.718
Well, yeah.
They don'’t have tickets.

1:12:11.892 --> 1:12:13.633
Well, they'’re in the box
with me.

1:12:15.026 --> 1:12:16.157
See you, Chip.

1:12:20.248 --> 1:12:21.293
Ready?

1:12:30.868 --> 1:12:31.956
Wow.

1:12:32.130 --> 1:12:34.437
This is how
people watch football?

1:12:35.133 --> 1:12:36.221
This is heaven.

1:12:36.395 --> 1:12:38.658
I know.
It'’s called a skybox.

1:12:38.832 --> 1:12:40.965
I'’m sorry
I was angry with you

1:12:41.139 --> 1:12:44.490
for hooking up with him
in that broom closet.

1:12:44.664 --> 1:12:46.013
I'’m glad you did.

1:12:46.187 --> 1:12:47.188
We were just kissing.

1:12:47.363 --> 1:12:49.408
Come on.
Let'’s see the view.

1:12:50.627 --> 1:12:52.498
Maybe this is heaven.

1:12:52.672 --> 1:12:54.239
Oh, look at this.

1:12:54.413 --> 1:12:56.284
You get such a great sense
of the whole field from up here.

1:12:56.459 --> 1:12:58.635
You can see everything.

1:12:58.809 --> 1:12:59.940
Exactly. Hey.

1:13:00.114 --> 1:13:02.334
You see that box
right across the way?

1:13:02.508 --> 1:13:04.684
That'’s the coordinator'’s booth.[Lou] That'’s where
they call the plays.

1:13:04.858 --> 1:13:07.774
Wait, you mean
those guys are talking
directly to Tom Brady?

1:13:07.948 --> 1:13:09.950
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, what a dream.

1:13:10.124 --> 1:13:11.430
Hey, grab a seat.

1:13:11.604 --> 1:13:13.693
Let me know
- if you need anything.
- Yeah.

1:13:17.001 --> 1:13:19.569
Dan, I'’m sorry
I didn'’t call you back.

1:13:19.743 --> 1:13:21.266
It'’s just--

1:13:21.440 --> 1:13:25.183
Sometimes I have a tendency
to go too quickly, you know?

1:13:25.357 --> 1:13:27.054
That'’s okay. I get it.

1:13:28.273 --> 1:13:29.796
There'’s no pressure.

1:13:29.970 --> 1:13:32.799
Let'’s spend some time together,
see what happens.

1:13:38.805 --> 1:13:40.851
Hey, Mickey. <i>Hey.</i>

1:13:41.025 --> 1:13:42.809
Um, listen.

1:13:42.983 --> 1:13:45.072
Some people around here,
they'’ve been asking about you.

1:13:45.246 --> 1:13:48.336
Some are under the impression
that you'’ve been kidnapped,
you know,

1:13:48.511 --> 1:13:50.904
so they questioned me
for about three hours.

1:13:51.078 --> 1:13:53.254
Of course, I'’m no snitch,
you know that.

1:13:53.429 --> 1:13:54.995
Thank you.
That'’s really nice,

1:13:55.169 --> 1:13:57.345
but I don'’t want
anybody to worry.

1:13:57.520 --> 1:13:59.260
You can be a snitch.
Go ahead.

1:13:59.435 --> 1:14:01.045
Okay.

1:14:01.219 --> 1:14:03.003
<i>So, when are you coming back?</i>

1:14:03.177 --> 1:14:04.440
<i>Some of the residents
around here,</i>

1:14:04.614 --> 1:14:08.008
they'’ve been, uh,
been eyeing your room.

1:14:08.182 --> 1:14:10.228
You know, I'’ve been
trying to keep them away,

1:14:10.402 --> 1:14:12.186
but they'’re like vultures,
you know?

1:14:13.666 --> 1:14:14.928
You know what, Mickey?

1:14:16.364 --> 1:14:17.627
Tell them they can have it.

1:14:18.845 --> 1:14:20.543
Does that mean you'’re leaving?

1:14:20.717 --> 1:14:22.414
<i>I'’m moving back to my house,</i>

1:14:22.588 --> 1:14:24.938
<i>but you can come over
whenever you want.</i>

1:14:25.461 --> 1:14:26.592
Oh.

1:14:29.073 --> 1:14:30.161
Yeah. Sure.

1:14:30.335 --> 1:14:31.467
<i>Go Pats, huh?</i>

1:14:31.641 --> 1:14:33.120
Go Pats!

1:14:33.294 --> 1:14:36.776
<i>Second quarter,
still 0-7, Falcons leading.</i>

1:14:36.950 --> 1:14:38.212
<i>And...</i>

1:14:38.386 --> 1:14:39.779
<i>...that'’s not gonna do it.</i>

1:14:41.651 --> 1:14:44.741
Hey, what do you think
a box like this costs?

1:14:44.915 --> 1:14:46.743
245,000.

1:14:46.917 --> 1:14:48.135
No.

1:14:48.309 --> 1:14:49.833
- You wanna bet?
- Yeah.

1:14:50.007 --> 1:14:52.270
What kind of buffoon
would spend all that money?

1:14:53.532 --> 1:14:54.533
Me.

1:14:56.013 --> 1:14:57.014
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

1:14:57.188 --> 1:14:59.059
Well, thank you
for having me.

1:14:59.233 --> 1:15:01.801
Well, I don'’t know who you are,
but I'’m glad you could make it.

1:15:02.672 --> 1:15:03.716
You'’re welcome.

1:15:05.065 --> 1:15:06.632
<i>Ryan drops back,
protection holds up.</i>

1:15:06.806 --> 1:15:07.938
<i>He lets it fly.</i>

1:15:08.112 --> 1:15:10.854
<i>End zone,
touchdown, Austin Hooper.</i>

1:15:11.028 --> 1:15:13.465
<i>Falcons,
now a two-touchdown lead.</i>

1:15:14.031 --> 1:15:14.945
You stink!

1:15:15.119 --> 1:15:16.642
Yeah, you tell '’em.

1:15:16.816 --> 1:15:18.905
- Hooper touchdown.
- Who the hell is this guy?
Come on.

1:15:21.604 --> 1:15:22.953
<i>Brady looks, throws.</i>

1:15:23.127 --> 1:15:24.737
<i>And it'’s picked! Oh!</i>

1:15:24.911 --> 1:15:27.044
<i>Intercepted by Robert Alford.</i>

1:15:28.785 --> 1:15:32.876
<i>It'’s officially
an 82-yard pick-six
for Rocky Alford.</i>

1:15:33.050 --> 1:15:33.833
<i>Touchdown.</i>

1:15:35.269 --> 1:15:37.315
Oh, Tom, come on.

1:15:37.489 --> 1:15:39.578
<i>It'’s only halftime.</i>[Nat] <i>21 to 3.</i>

1:15:39.752 --> 1:15:42.015
Somebody better be saying
something really inspiring

1:15:42.189 --> 1:15:43.539
in that locker room
- right now.
- I hope so.

1:15:46.977 --> 1:15:49.588
<i>And we are underway
here in the third quarter.</i>

1:15:49.762 --> 1:15:51.503
<i>It just takes one play.</i>[Nat] <i>Sure.</i>

1:15:51.677 --> 1:15:53.549
It just takes one play.

1:15:53.723 --> 1:15:55.681
One play and then
you got momentum
and then...

1:15:57.901 --> 1:15:59.250
<i>To Coleman.</i>

1:15:59.424 --> 1:16:01.165
<i>End zone touchdown.</i>

1:16:01.339 --> 1:16:04.516
<i>28-3. This one
has been all Atlanta.</i>

1:16:06.649 --> 1:16:08.389
- Wow.
- That sucked.

1:16:12.393 --> 1:16:15.222
28-3. What'’s happening?

1:16:15.396 --> 1:16:18.182
Well, it'’s just
the third quarter.

1:16:18.356 --> 1:16:20.053
They could still come back.

1:16:20.227 --> 1:16:22.534
Well, I'’m sorry
for your loss, ladies.

1:16:22.708 --> 1:16:24.188
Well, thank you,

1:16:24.362 --> 1:16:25.972
but we have not lost yet.

1:16:26.146 --> 1:16:27.147
No.

1:16:28.192 --> 1:16:29.672
Do you know
what the Patriots'’ chances

1:16:29.846 --> 1:16:31.238
of pulling this one out are?

1:16:31.978 --> 1:16:33.545
- One percent?
- Close.

1:16:33.719 --> 1:16:36.374
They have
a .7% chance of winning.

1:16:36.548 --> 1:16:39.116
I still think
they can pull it out.

1:16:39.290 --> 1:16:41.814
Oh, hon,
I wouldn'’t bet on it.

1:16:47.298 --> 1:16:49.300
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
as a reminder,</i>

1:16:49.474 --> 1:16:52.172
<i>we will have the official
Lombardi Trophy presentation</i>

1:16:52.346 --> 1:16:54.653
<i>at the conclusion
of this game.</i>

1:16:54.827 --> 1:16:57.961
Pardon my language,
but screw this.

1:16:58.135 --> 1:16:59.397
Are you leaving?

1:16:59.571 --> 1:17:01.399
I'’m gonna do something
about it.

1:17:01.573 --> 1:17:03.009
You can stay here
if you want to,

1:17:03.183 --> 1:17:05.795
but this is not
how my Super Bowl ends.

1:17:07.753 --> 1:17:09.668
- Hey, hang on to this.
- We got a deal.

1:17:11.278 --> 1:17:12.628
- What'’s up?
- Let'’s go. Let'’s go.

1:17:12.802 --> 1:17:13.759
- What?
- Let'’s go. Come on.

1:17:13.933 --> 1:17:14.934
Lou?

1:17:22.507 --> 1:17:24.814
Five minutes to go
in the third quarter,

1:17:24.988 --> 1:17:27.512
and we are down by...

1:17:29.383 --> 1:17:31.647
- a lot. It'’s a lot.
- Yeah.

1:17:31.821 --> 1:17:34.737
It is not looking good,
- Pats Nation.
- No.

1:17:38.697 --> 1:17:40.873
We gotta find a way
to get the ball
in the end zone.

1:17:41.047 --> 1:17:43.093
We got no choice but to stay
in our two-minute offense

1:17:43.267 --> 1:17:45.269
for the rest of the game.
We got no time left.

1:17:46.052 --> 1:17:47.053
Hey!

1:17:49.621 --> 1:17:51.710
Let'’s go cover two.
Cover two. Yeah. Yeah.

1:17:51.884 --> 1:17:53.451
Yeah. Double on Julio.
Watch the scene.

1:17:53.625 --> 1:17:54.974
Over Matt too.

1:17:55.148 --> 1:17:57.194
- Let'’s go. Cover two.
- No, no. Go to cover one.

1:17:57.368 --> 1:17:58.630
- Go to cover one.
- What are you doing?

1:17:58.804 --> 1:18:00.066
- You can'’t be in here.
- Listen to me now.

1:18:00.240 --> 1:18:01.807
It frees McCourty
to play the run,

1:18:01.981 --> 1:18:04.114
get some sort of
creative blitz going here.

1:18:04.288 --> 1:18:06.507
You'’ve got great linebackers.
Use '’em, for God'’s sakes.

1:18:06.682 --> 1:18:07.987
Why are we in cover one?

1:18:08.161 --> 1:18:10.294
What? No. Cover two. What?

1:18:15.125 --> 1:18:16.779
Yes![coach 2] Let'’s go!

1:18:16.953 --> 1:18:19.564
- Tom?
- Hey, you can'’t touch that.
What--

1:18:19.738 --> 1:18:21.958
You wanna get to her,
you gotta go through me.

1:18:22.785 --> 1:18:24.047
Leave them. They can stay.

1:18:24.221 --> 1:18:25.178
- What else you got?
- Okay.

1:18:25.352 --> 1:18:27.441
Tom? Tom, can you hear me?

1:18:27.615 --> 1:18:29.400
<i>Can you hear me, Tom?</i>

1:18:30.314 --> 1:18:31.489
<i>Up here.</i>

1:18:31.663 --> 1:18:34.144
<i>Tom, can you hear me?</i>

1:18:34.971 --> 1:18:36.450
<i>Can you hear me, Tom?</i>

1:18:36.624 --> 1:18:37.800
Up here. Up here.

1:18:38.409 --> 1:18:39.410
Up here.

1:18:40.367 --> 1:18:43.066
I'’m Louella.
I'’m your biggest fan.

1:18:44.981 --> 1:18:47.374
I don'’t know if this is
the right time to talk.

1:18:47.548 --> 1:18:52.292
Sixteen years ago,
I was in the middle of chemo,

1:18:52.466 --> 1:18:55.513
feeling like I was done,
like I had nothing more in me.

1:18:55.687 --> 1:18:57.515
And then you came on the TV,

1:18:57.689 --> 1:19:00.692
fearless, determined,
a skinny little rookie.

1:19:00.866 --> 1:19:02.999
Watching you play that season

1:19:03.173 --> 1:19:05.566
gave me something extra
to look forward to.

1:19:05.741 --> 1:19:08.178
Each week,
I found strength in that,

1:19:08.352 --> 1:19:10.397
and that strength got me
through my treatments.

1:19:10.571 --> 1:19:13.183
But that was 16 years ago,

1:19:13.357 --> 1:19:14.924
and I'’ve enjoyed
every moment since.

1:19:15.098 --> 1:19:17.970
And I'’m sure you enjoyed
winning all those Super Bowls.

1:19:19.450 --> 1:19:22.105
But that was the past,
and we can'’t live in the past.

1:19:22.279 --> 1:19:25.586
No matter how good
or how bad it was.

1:19:25.761 --> 1:19:29.112
Right now
we have this one moment,

1:19:29.286 --> 1:19:31.679
and you'’re down
in this game, a lot.

1:19:31.854 --> 1:19:33.899
But you'’re Tom Brady.

1:19:34.073 --> 1:19:35.771
You have to come back.

1:19:35.945 --> 1:19:37.294
That'’s what you do best.

1:19:37.468 --> 1:19:39.513
And I love you
because you are the best.

1:19:39.687 --> 1:19:42.778
And anyone who doesn'’t
love you respects you

1:19:42.952 --> 1:19:45.171
because you fight
and you never give up.

1:19:48.784 --> 1:19:50.481
So I'’m not giving up either.

1:19:53.701 --> 1:19:55.529
I don'’t know
what'’s ahead for me,

1:19:56.835 --> 1:19:58.619
but if you fight,
I'’ll fight.

1:20:05.931 --> 1:20:07.672
Now go out there and win.

1:20:09.892 --> 1:20:11.371
Let'’s go!

1:20:15.332 --> 1:20:16.724
Let'’s fucking go!

1:20:19.510 --> 1:20:21.207
- How was that?
- That was...

1:20:21.381 --> 1:20:23.209
Beautiful.

1:20:23.383 --> 1:20:24.820
All yours.

1:20:24.994 --> 1:20:26.430
Let'’s go, offense.
Offense is up. Let'’s go.

1:20:26.604 --> 1:20:28.475
<i>Come on.
We got a Super Bowl to win.</i>

1:20:44.143 --> 1:20:46.580
Hey! Hey,
there'’s nine minutes left
and they'’ve got momentum.

1:20:46.754 --> 1:20:49.932
If they pull this off,
it'’ll be the greatest comeback
in NFL history.

1:20:50.106 --> 1:20:51.107
Oh, my God.

1:20:54.023 --> 1:20:55.372
Actually, in '’93,

1:20:55.546 --> 1:20:57.591
the Bills came back
from a much larger deficit,

1:20:57.765 --> 1:20:59.289
but who'’s talking statistics?

1:20:59.463 --> 1:21:01.247
Betty, what are you doing?
Come on.

1:21:04.076 --> 1:21:06.383
All right. That just
puts us two touchdowns

1:21:06.557 --> 1:21:09.995
and two two-point
- conversions away.
- And two-- Yeah.

1:21:10.169 --> 1:21:12.955
Yeah, exactly.
Two touchdowns and two--So that'’s doable.

1:21:13.129 --> 1:21:14.347
That'’s all they gotta do.

1:21:14.521 --> 1:21:16.088
- That'’s all they gotta do.
- Oh, my God.

1:21:16.262 --> 1:21:18.003
We gotta play harder.

1:21:18.177 --> 1:21:20.310
Gotta play tougher.
Harder, tougher everything.

1:21:22.312 --> 1:21:24.880
<i>Ryan gets hit,
and that'’s a fumble.</i>

1:21:25.054 --> 1:21:26.620
<i>New England recovers.</i>

1:21:26.794 --> 1:21:28.622
<i>Something has really
gotten into the Patriots.</i>

1:21:28.796 --> 1:21:30.276
We got the ball back.

1:21:31.190 --> 1:21:33.323
This is too stressful.
Oh, God.

1:21:35.064 --> 1:21:36.108
<i>Brady...</i>

1:21:37.370 --> 1:21:40.025
<i>connects with Amendola.
Touchdown Patriots.</i>

1:21:40.634 --> 1:21:41.897
<i>28-18.</i>

1:21:45.639 --> 1:21:47.554
- Amendola.
- Oh, my God.
That was nice.

1:21:47.728 --> 1:21:50.296
He'’s got a skull
like a baby bird'’s,

1:21:50.470 --> 1:21:52.995
but his hands
are like Midas.

1:21:53.169 --> 1:21:54.779
<i>Brady throws up two.</i>

1:21:54.953 --> 1:21:56.912
<i>Two-point conversion,
here we go.</i>

1:21:57.086 --> 1:21:59.653
<i>It'’s a direct snap
to James right through.
Right through.</i>

1:21:59.827 --> 1:22:01.612
- He'’s in there!
- Oh, he'’s got it.

1:22:01.786 --> 1:22:03.570
<i>Oh, my God.
Give Tom an Oscar for that.</i>

1:22:03.744 --> 1:22:06.008
<i>I thought that was it.
Oh, my God.</i>

1:22:07.531 --> 1:22:09.098
<i>20-28.</i>

1:22:09.272 --> 1:22:10.969
<i>Someone must have said
something inspiring to Brady,</i>

1:22:11.143 --> 1:22:12.753
<i>'’cause he is on fire.</i>

1:22:12.928 --> 1:22:14.538
<i>It'’s a one-score game.</i>

1:22:16.801 --> 1:22:18.194
<i>Matt up in the pocket.</i>

1:22:18.368 --> 1:22:20.457
<i>Now gonna cut it loose,
looking for Julio.</i>

1:22:20.631 --> 1:22:21.849
<i>What a catch!</i>

1:22:22.024 --> 1:22:24.243
<i>He made a catch! Unbelievable!</i>

1:22:27.551 --> 1:22:30.206
<i>Oh,
they just sacked Matty Ice.[Nat] Oh, my God.</i>

1:22:30.380 --> 1:22:33.165
<i>Oh, my God.
He can'’t kick it from there.</i>

1:22:33.339 --> 1:22:34.384
Attaboy, Flowers. Come on.

1:22:34.558 --> 1:22:35.863
<i>Two and a half minutes left.</i>

1:22:36.038 --> 1:22:37.865
<i>We gotta get
down the field here, kid.</i>

1:22:42.609 --> 1:22:44.133
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1:22:45.961 --> 1:22:48.398
I caught it. It'’s crazy.
I swear to God.

1:22:48.572 --> 1:22:49.790
- No way. Look at that.
- Watch.

1:22:49.965 --> 1:22:51.401
- Look there.
- Yo.

1:22:51.575 --> 1:22:52.968
<i>Edelman comes down
with the football.</i>

1:22:53.142 --> 1:22:54.317
<i>They'’re saying it'’s a catch.</i>

1:22:54.491 --> 1:22:56.319
<i>It'’s a catch! It'’s a catch!</i>

1:22:56.493 --> 1:22:58.190
<i>It'’s a catch!</i>[Pat] <i>That is
the greatest catch...</i>

1:22:58.364 --> 1:23:00.410
Oh, my freaking Lord....in NFL history.

1:23:00.584 --> 1:23:02.151
Off his leg.

1:23:02.325 --> 1:23:03.848
After review,
the ruling on the field
is confirmed.

1:23:11.029 --> 1:23:12.074
That'’s crazy.

1:23:14.032 --> 1:23:15.468
<i>Passes it off to James White,</i>

1:23:15.642 --> 1:23:17.644
<i>who runs it into the end zone.</i>

1:23:17.818 --> 1:23:20.212
<i>And he'’s in there.
He'’s in there.</i>[Nat] <i>Oh, my God!</i>

1:23:20.386 --> 1:23:22.388
<i>We'’re within two!
Two points away.</i>

1:23:22.562 --> 1:23:24.434
Oh, my God, James White.
You beauty.

1:23:26.305 --> 1:23:28.612
We need a two-point conversion.
We only have a minute left.

1:23:28.786 --> 1:23:30.875
Miracles happen.
They happen every day.

1:23:32.572 --> 1:23:35.184
<i>Quick screen to Amendola
and he'’s in.</i>

1:23:37.882 --> 1:23:39.971
- It'’s tied! It'’s tied!
- He tied it! He tied it!

1:23:40.145 --> 1:23:42.452
<i>The ball crossed the line.
He is in.</i>

1:23:48.153 --> 1:23:49.241
Way to go.

1:23:49.415 --> 1:23:50.329
Let'’s go!

1:23:50.503 --> 1:23:53.593
Tom Brady!

1:23:55.552 --> 1:23:57.771
Oh, my God.
Overtime for the first time

1:23:57.945 --> 1:24:00.296
- in Super Bowl history.
- Oh, my God.

1:24:00.470 --> 1:24:03.777
- Holy sh-- Oh, my God.
- We are going to overtime.

1:24:03.951 --> 1:24:06.345
Hey, would somebody get him
his blood pressure cuff?

1:24:06.519 --> 1:24:07.999
Oh, my God.

1:24:08.173 --> 1:24:10.610
It'’s not over. It'’s not over.
Stay focused.

1:24:10.784 --> 1:24:12.743
Gentlemen, we'’re about to
begin an overtime period

1:24:12.917 --> 1:24:15.006
that will continue
until a winner is determined.

1:24:15.180 --> 1:24:16.616
It is sudden death,

1:24:16.790 --> 1:24:18.879
unless the first team
to possess kicks a field goal,

1:24:19.054 --> 1:24:21.186
in which case the other team
will have an opportunity.

1:24:21.360 --> 1:24:24.146
This is heads.
This is tails.

1:24:24.320 --> 1:24:25.451
New England gets to
call the toss.

1:24:25.625 --> 1:24:27.323
- Heads.
- They have called heads.

1:24:29.934 --> 1:24:32.067
- It is heads.
- We'’ll take the ball.

1:24:32.241 --> 1:24:33.807
- Yes!
- Yes! Yes!

1:24:33.981 --> 1:24:36.419
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Okay. Hear me.

1:24:36.593 --> 1:24:38.247
- Okay, okay.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1:24:39.683 --> 1:24:42.381
Let'’s go score
- and win this thing, baby.
- Yeah. Here we go.

1:24:53.175 --> 1:24:54.480
<i>Amendola with the catch.</i>

1:25:05.230 --> 1:25:06.666
<i>Tom Brady to Hogan.</i>

1:25:06.840 --> 1:25:08.625
<i>For 16 yards.</i> Let'’s go, Hoge!

1:25:09.756 --> 1:25:12.194
<i>Oh! Oh!
A few more for good measure.</i>

1:25:12.368 --> 1:25:15.022
I think I'’m gonna throw up,
and this is the best
experience of my life.

1:25:20.767 --> 1:25:22.639
<i>Pass to Edelman.
Fifteen yards. Here we go.</i>

1:25:22.813 --> 1:25:24.554
<i>Nice.</i>[Pat] <i>This is it,
piece by piece.</i>

1:25:24.728 --> 1:25:25.685
<i>We'’re marching.</i>

1:25:28.210 --> 1:25:29.646
<i>Here'’s Bennett.</i>

1:25:32.083 --> 1:25:33.780
<i>Couldn'’t hold onto it.</i>

1:25:39.308 --> 1:25:41.353
Come on, Tom. You'’ve got this.

1:25:45.749 --> 1:25:47.229
Green 19!

1:26:04.681 --> 1:26:06.639
[announcer] <i>He'’s in!</i>

1:26:06.813 --> 1:26:09.381
<i>Patriots win the Super Bowl.</i>

1:26:17.084 --> 1:26:20.610
<i>The Pats win
the Super Bowl.</i>[chuckles]

1:26:20.784 --> 1:26:22.351
I cannot be-- Come here.

1:26:25.354 --> 1:26:26.703
- Oh, my God.
- I love you, kid.

1:26:26.877 --> 1:26:28.052
They did it!

1:26:29.314 --> 1:26:30.228
You did it.

1:26:30.402 --> 1:26:32.056
No, we did it.

1:26:32.230 --> 1:26:34.841
We did it. We did it.

1:27:23.194 --> 1:27:25.327
Oh, it was worth every penny.

1:27:27.938 --> 1:27:31.463
Lou, how much
did you spend on this?

1:27:31.637 --> 1:27:33.073
Mmm. A lot.

1:27:34.640 --> 1:27:36.120
I might be able
to help with that.

1:27:36.294 --> 1:27:37.774
What do you mean?

1:27:37.948 --> 1:27:40.167
In the third quarter,
I made a bet with that rich guy

1:27:40.342 --> 1:27:42.431
that the Pats would
come back and win.

1:27:43.083 --> 1:27:44.389
How much did you win?

1:27:44.563 --> 1:27:46.261
A lot.

1:27:46.435 --> 1:27:49.699
But he didn'’t have
enough cash on him,
so the poor guy--

1:27:50.308 --> 1:27:51.527
I just had to, uh...

1:27:52.484 --> 1:27:53.442
take this.

1:27:54.399 --> 1:27:56.749
Oh, my God.

1:27:56.923 --> 1:27:59.709
So you'’re the women
that broke into
the coaches'’ booth.

1:27:59.883 --> 1:28:01.276
I did. I'’m the one.

1:28:01.450 --> 1:28:02.973
I should'’ve known.

1:28:03.147 --> 1:28:05.192
Come with me.
All of you.

1:28:05.367 --> 1:28:07.847
- No, no. Don'’t take them.
- You'’re not going alone.

1:28:08.979 --> 1:28:10.546
You sure walk slow.

1:28:10.720 --> 1:28:12.983
Yeah. Walking with authority.

1:28:14.114 --> 1:28:16.595
I'’m sorry. I know
we shouldn'’t have done it.

1:28:16.769 --> 1:28:18.293
But someone
had to do something.

1:28:18.467 --> 1:28:20.643
They were gonna lose.

1:28:20.817 --> 1:28:23.036
I can'’t believe
- we'’re doing this.
- What'’s gonna happen to us?

1:28:23.210 --> 1:28:26.213
Oh, God.[Lou] I haven'’t been to jail
since '’67.

1:28:26.388 --> 1:28:27.389
Hey!

1:28:41.359 --> 1:28:42.404
Oh, my God.

1:28:42.926 --> 1:28:44.231
Oh, my God.

1:28:44.406 --> 1:28:47.191
Oh, my God.
You'’re Danny Amendola.

1:28:47.365 --> 1:28:48.453
- Yeah.
- Danny Amendola,

1:28:48.627 --> 1:28:49.933
you have
the highest catch percentage

1:28:50.107 --> 1:28:51.108
of anyone out there.

1:28:51.282 --> 1:28:53.023
You are reliable.

1:28:53.197 --> 1:28:55.373
Oh, that'’s the nicest thing
anybody'’s ever said to me.

1:28:55.547 --> 1:28:57.767
What do you mean?
I'’m sure they say that
to you all the time.

1:28:57.941 --> 1:29:00.204
- Is this yours?
- Oh, yeah. I'’m sorry.
It'’s sweaty.

1:29:00.378 --> 1:29:02.685
Oh, yes, it'’s very sweaty.
And does your head actually...

1:29:02.859 --> 1:29:04.469
I wanna shave you.

1:29:05.949 --> 1:29:06.993
Yeah.

1:29:21.007 --> 1:29:23.096
- Gronk.
- Hi.

1:29:23.270 --> 1:29:24.489
Have you--
Have you read this book?

1:29:24.663 --> 1:29:27.057
I take it everywhere I go.

1:29:27.231 --> 1:29:29.015
You'’re so big.

1:29:30.016 --> 1:29:31.061
Thank you.

1:29:32.367 --> 1:29:33.368
Louella?

1:29:34.543 --> 1:29:35.587
Tom.

1:29:36.762 --> 1:29:38.938
I wanna thank you
for what you did out there.

1:29:40.113 --> 1:29:41.027
Thank you so much.

1:29:41.201 --> 1:29:43.073
I should say
the same to you.

1:29:44.988 --> 1:29:46.642
Oh, what a day.

1:29:47.860 --> 1:29:50.036
- Can you believe it?
- No.

1:29:59.698 --> 1:30:01.265
Thanks for saying all that.

1:30:05.138 --> 1:30:06.226
I don'’t know how you did it,

1:30:06.401 --> 1:30:09.578
but your words
meant the world to me.

1:30:11.101 --> 1:30:12.407
We were down.

1:30:13.669 --> 1:30:15.584
You knew just what I needed.

1:30:17.499 --> 1:30:19.457
You know,
I play a game that I love,

1:30:20.371 --> 1:30:21.590
this game of football,

1:30:21.764 --> 1:30:23.983
and it'’s taught me so much.

1:30:24.157 --> 1:30:28.814
And people say all the time,
"You inspire me," and...

1:30:30.816 --> 1:30:32.209
it'’s just a game.

1:30:33.602 --> 1:30:36.213
What you'’ve been through,
how tough you are,

1:30:37.083 --> 1:30:38.650
you inspire me.

1:30:38.824 --> 1:30:41.261
And your courage
inspires me,

1:30:41.436 --> 1:30:42.480
so thank you.

1:30:46.702 --> 1:30:47.746
You'’re welcome.

1:30:49.748 --> 1:30:51.358
And I love that jersey.

1:30:53.230 --> 1:30:54.274
Wow.

1:30:55.014 --> 1:30:56.494
Could we do a jersey swap?

1:30:57.800 --> 1:31:00.193
- This jersey for your jersey?
- Yeah.

1:31:00.367 --> 1:31:03.980
And it'’s all sweaty
- and everything?
- It'’s got a lot of sweat on it.

1:31:04.154 --> 1:31:06.330
- All right. I can do it.
- Yes.

1:31:06.504 --> 1:31:09.202
That one is--
I'’ve never had anything
with the sequins like that.

1:31:10.421 --> 1:31:12.379
Where is my jersey?

1:31:12.554 --> 1:31:13.816
It was just right here.

1:31:14.991 --> 1:31:17.515
Well, you know,
you can send it to me.

1:31:18.124 --> 1:31:18.951
I will.

1:31:20.083 --> 1:31:21.127
Of course.

1:31:30.006 --> 1:31:32.182
<i>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers
will start this season</i>

1:31:32.356 --> 1:31:34.184
<i>with a new quarterback
at the helm.</i>

1:31:34.358 --> 1:31:37.448
<i>Forty-three-year-old Tom Brady
will try to
turn around a franchise</i>

1:31:37.622 --> 1:31:40.799
<i>that hasn'’t even been
to the post-season since 2007.</i>

1:31:40.973 --> 1:31:42.540
<i>At this point,</i>

1:31:42.714 --> 1:31:44.150
<i>I'’ve learned to never doubt
what Brady is capable of,</i>

1:31:44.324 --> 1:31:45.891
<i>but you have to imagine...</i> Game'’s about to start.

1:31:46.065 --> 1:31:47.153
Hey, guys.

1:31:47.327 --> 1:31:48.807
Come on.
The game is about to start.

1:31:48.981 --> 1:31:50.243
- Okay.
- How'’s the guacamole?

1:31:50.417 --> 1:31:51.636
- It'’s done.
- Let'’s see.

1:31:51.810 --> 1:31:53.464
- No. More onion.
- Come on.

1:31:53.638 --> 1:31:55.727
- More onion? Of course.
- I think
you'’re doing just fine.

1:31:55.901 --> 1:31:58.077
Well, she'’s a woman
who knows what she wants.

1:31:58.251 --> 1:32:00.427
Let'’s go.
- It'’s about to begin.
- We'’re coming. We'’re coming.

1:32:00.602 --> 1:32:01.907
Hurry.

1:32:02.081 --> 1:32:04.127
Before anyone else does,
I wanna make a toast.

1:32:05.302 --> 1:32:06.869
To a new season,

1:32:07.043 --> 1:32:08.871
a new team,

1:32:09.045 --> 1:32:11.221
and to the woman
who brought us all together.

1:32:12.265 --> 1:32:13.919
Wait a minute,
where the heck is she?

1:32:14.964 --> 1:32:15.834
Mom, come on!

1:32:16.008 --> 1:32:17.662
We'’re all ready!

1:32:17.836 --> 1:32:20.709
I was in the garage,
getting chips.

1:32:20.883 --> 1:32:25.061
- To our healthy quarterback.
- Oh.

1:32:25.235 --> 1:32:27.063
<i>All set here at Tampa Bay.</i> Kickoff. Hurry up.

1:32:27.237 --> 1:32:30.719
<i>There'’s the whistle.
This is the kickoff,
and we are underway.</i>

1:32:52.871 --> 1:32:54.612
So when are you gonna retire?

1:32:54.786 --> 1:32:57.180
I don'’t like to
use the word "retire."
It sounds so final.

1:32:58.485 --> 1:33:02.228
I don'’t "retire."
I just change careers.

1:33:02.402 --> 1:33:03.882
Often.

1:33:04.056 --> 1:33:05.884
Technically,
I took a sabbatical
many years ago,

1:33:06.058 --> 1:33:07.930
and I just never returned
to work.

1:33:08.104 --> 1:33:12.238
I wasn'’t asking you girls.
I was asking him.

1:33:12.412 --> 1:33:15.154
You know, I'’ve thought a lot
about retirement.

1:33:15.328 --> 1:33:19.419
But it'’d be a shame
to retire if you feel
like you still got it.

1:33:19.594 --> 1:33:20.899
Join the club.

1:33:21.073 --> 1:33:22.509
- Yeah. I'’ll drink to that.
- Hear! Hear!

1:33:22.684 --> 1:33:24.337
- Me too.
- Look at this spot.

1:33:25.208 --> 1:33:27.253
- Cheers.
- Tampa. Who knew?
