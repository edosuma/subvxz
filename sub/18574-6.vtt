00:01.240 --> 00:02.810
What happened to the Doctor?

00:02.880 --> 00:04.245
The Doctor took you to safety.

00:04.320 --> 00:05.367
He paid a price.

00:05.440 --> 00:06.487
You're blind.

00:06.560 --> 00:07.561
It's temporary.

00:07.640 --> 00:10.962
- Look at me!
- Nardole, I can't. I really can't.

00:12.240 --> 00:15.130
I can't look at anything ever again.

00:16.320 --> 00:18.288
I'm still blind.

00:19.960 --> 00:23.248
Death is an increasing problem.

00:25.080 --> 00:30.007
With over a billion intelligent species
active in this galaxy alone,

00:30.080 --> 00:34.961
it is an ever greater challenge to know
how to kill all of them.

00:35.680 --> 00:38.809
On this planet, we are proud to serve
as executioners

00:38.880 --> 00:41.804
to every living thing.

00:42.400 --> 00:47.406
The destruction of a Time Lord
however, is a particular honour.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.962
This technology is precisely calibrated.

00:51.760 --> 00:52.921
As you can see,

00:54.280 --> 00:58.490
it will stop both hearts,
all three brain stems,

00:58.600 --> 01:00.568
and deliver a cellular shockwave

01:00.640 --> 01:03.962
that will permanently disable
regenerative ability.

01:05.519 --> 01:06.806
I know how it works.

01:07.240 --> 01:09.083
You certainly will in a moment.

01:11.400 --> 01:12.845
Following termination,

01:13.520 --> 01:15.761
the body will be placed
in a quantum fold chamber

01:15.840 --> 01:18.764
under constant guard
for no less than a thousand years.

01:19.400 --> 01:23.166
In case of, shall we say, relapses.

01:24.440 --> 01:27.330
Life can be a cunning enemy.

01:27.840 --> 01:31.049
An additional stipulation
of the fatality index

01:32.760 --> 01:35.491
is that the sentence must be carried out
by another Time Lord.

01:36.760 --> 01:39.923
Apologies for our choice,
but your people are not easy to come by.

01:43.320 --> 01:45.482
Oh, Doctor?

01:45.840 --> 01:47.808
I didn't expect you.

01:48.320 --> 01:50.084
Thought you'd retired.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.885
Domestic bliss on Darillium.

01:53.240 --> 01:55.163
That's the word among the Daleks.

01:55.880 --> 01:57.166
What happened?

01:59.520 --> 02:00.646
Oh, I see.

02:02.800 --> 02:03.926
My condolences.

02:13.880 --> 02:16.167
The prisoner will kneel.

02:25.240 --> 02:26.401
Right.

02:29.320 --> 02:30.446
Thank you.

02:41.040 --> 02:43.327
They can't know I'm blind, Missy.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.606
No one can know.

02:44.920 --> 02:47.321
Memories are so much worse in the dark.

02:56.040 --> 02:58.281
The quantum fold chamber is prepared.

02:58.360 --> 02:59.441
Great.

03:00.160 --> 03:02.322
The sentence will be carried out.

03:05.640 --> 03:06.641
Executioner?

03:16.800 --> 03:19.041
Please, I'll do anything.

03:22.600 --> 03:23.840
Just let me live.

04:27.840 --> 04:28.887
Hello?

04:32.320 --> 04:34.322
Hello? Who's there?

04:34.400 --> 04:36.448
Good evening, Doctor.

04:40.160 --> 04:43.448
We have come here today,
direct from the Vatican.

04:43.520 --> 04:45.443
All right, that's nice.

04:45.640 --> 04:47.529
Well, if you've got a collecting tin,

04:47.880 --> 04:49.291
I'm sure I can find something.

04:49.360 --> 04:50.691
Uh, leaky roof, is it?

04:50.920 --> 04:52.763
Oh, no.

04:52.840 --> 04:55.491
No. No, no. No, no, no. Stop talking.

04:55.880 --> 04:59.851
Stop now. Please, just listen to them.
Sounds important.

04:59.960 --> 05:01.564
We have come here to see you,

05:01.640 --> 05:05.964
because your services of wisdom
are recommended at the highest level.

05:12.920 --> 05:14.046
As you can see,

05:14.120 --> 05:16.885
This is a personal recommendation
of Pope Benedict IX...

05:18.120 --> 05:19.485
in 1045.

05:21.800 --> 05:23.006
Pope Benedict.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.685
Lovely girl. What a night.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.202
I knew she was trouble,

05:27.280 --> 05:29.044
but she wove a spell
with her castanets.

05:29.120 --> 05:33.170
Doctor, on behalf of every human soul
in this world,

05:33.240 --> 05:34.651
of any creed, of any faith,

05:35.280 --> 05:37.009
with the utmost respect

05:37.240 --> 05:38.571
and in complete secrecy,

05:38.640 --> 05:41.484
His Holiness, the Pope,
the Bishop of Rome,

05:41.560 --> 05:44.928
request most urgently
a personal audience.

05:45.800 --> 05:48.451
Well, if he was so keen to talk to me,
why didn't he just come here himself?

05:48.560 --> 05:51.484
He is here.
He's standing right in front of us.

05:52.720 --> 05:53.926
Hello.

05:54.520 --> 05:58.081
Uh, the Pope. I'm sorry
that I didn't recognise you there.

06:00.320 --> 06:01.970
You don't do this.

06:02.880 --> 06:07.363
The Pope doesn't zoom around the world
in the Popemobile surprising people.

06:08.640 --> 06:10.005
Why would you do that?

06:10.120 --> 06:12.202
Mmm-hmm.

06:13.600 --> 06:14.681
Extremis.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.964
There is an ancient text

06:21.480 --> 06:24.324
buried deep in the most secret
of the Vatican libraries.

06:24.560 --> 06:26.722
Text older than the church itself.

06:31.480 --> 06:35.565
The language of this text is lost to us.

06:36.040 --> 06:39.328
But thanks to the work
of an early Christian sect,

06:39.680 --> 06:42.650
the title has survived.

06:44.160 --> 06:45.605
Okay, so, what's the title?

06:46.960 --> 06:51.921
Oh, yes, I can see
that it says, uh, "Veritas".

06:52.000 --> 06:54.048
Oh. Hmm.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.289
Literally, "the Truth".

06:57.120 --> 07:00.090
Obviously, this sect,
they understood the language.

07:00.160 --> 07:01.241
It died with them.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.402
And all copies of their translation

07:03.480 --> 07:06.404
disappeared shortly
after their mass suicide.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.288
Few months ago,
after many centuries of work,

07:11.120 --> 07:13.851
the Veritas was translated again.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.361
Right. And?

07:17.600 --> 07:19.011
What did it say?

07:19.520 --> 07:20.521
No one knows.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.800
Everyone who worked on the translation
and everyone who subsequently read it

07:24.880 --> 07:26.006
is now dead.

07:29.040 --> 07:32.169
Dead, Doctor, by their own hand.

07:33.480 --> 07:35.562
The Veritas is a short document.

07:35.720 --> 07:37.051
A few pages only.

07:37.200 --> 07:40.090
And yet contains a secret

07:40.360 --> 07:43.603
that drives all who know it
to destroy themselves.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.211
Confirmed suicides, all of them?

07:45.280 --> 07:47.044
In every case, beyond doubt.

07:47.120 --> 07:48.281
All bodies recovered?

07:48.760 --> 07:51.331
Except one. But we naturally assumed...

07:51.400 --> 07:52.765
Assume nothing.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.968
Assumption makes an
ass out of you and umption.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.088
Cardinal, one of your
translators is missing.

07:57.160 --> 08:01.131
Doctor, those translators
were devout believers.

08:01.200 --> 08:02.929
They took their own lives

08:03.160 --> 08:06.164
in the knowledge that suicide
is a mortal sin.

08:06.680 --> 08:10.048
They read the Veritas and chose hell.

08:10.720 --> 08:11.881
Dottore...

08:13.800 --> 08:16.531
Will you read the Veritas?

08:23.480 --> 08:25.084
- Loo through there.
- Oh, ta.

08:25.160 --> 08:26.650
I thought you moved out from here.

08:26.880 --> 08:29.486
Yeah, slightly didn't work out.

08:29.560 --> 08:31.324
Second attempt on the way.

08:38.159 --> 08:39.366
Did I hear voices?

08:39.760 --> 08:41.842
I thought you were going out
with Harry tonight.

08:42.039 --> 08:43.929
- Howard.
- I don't like knowing the names,

08:44.039 --> 08:45.087
I only get attached.

08:45.640 --> 08:47.165
Did you bring someone home?

08:48.120 --> 08:49.326
Yeah.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.488
I'm a grownup, I can do that, can't I?

08:52.600 --> 08:55.490
Of course not. I have very strict rules
about men.

08:55.720 --> 08:57.449
Probably not as strict as mine.

09:03.120 --> 09:04.326
Oh, hello, are you Moira?

09:04.400 --> 09:06.448
Oh, you're a girl.

09:06.520 --> 09:07.646
Mmm. I'm Penny.

09:07.720 --> 09:09.051
Oh. Oh.

09:09.120 --> 09:10.929
Oh, I see. Oh, I'm sorry.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.766
Here's me thinking she dragged
some poor terrified man home.

09:15.080 --> 09:17.003
Well, phew!

09:17.080 --> 09:18.650
Oh, phew.

09:18.720 --> 09:21.326
Right, you two. I'm off to the pub.

09:21.400 --> 09:22.925
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.131
Well...

09:27.480 --> 09:29.130
Alone at last.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.804
Oh, God. What was that?

09:41.120 --> 09:42.167
The, uh...

09:42.560 --> 09:43.925
pipes.

09:44.240 --> 09:46.004
It's... It's the... The pipes

09:46.080 --> 09:47.491
in... In my bedroom.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.410
Be warned. Sometimes I shout at them.

09:50.760 --> 09:51.886
Wha...

09:53.600 --> 09:54.761
Are you okay?

09:55.040 --> 09:57.361
Yeah, sorry,
I'm just not quite used to...

09:57.480 --> 09:58.811
all of this.

09:58.880 --> 10:02.726
Well, whatever this is,

10:03.680 --> 10:06.729
and actually, it's not anything yet,

10:08.040 --> 10:11.283
it is absolutely nothing
to feel guilty about.

10:12.760 --> 10:14.842
- Okay?
- Okay.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.001
That was the Pope.

10:35.080 --> 10:37.082
Bill, that was the Pope.

10:39.320 --> 10:40.446
Yeah, yeah, give me a minute.

10:40.520 --> 10:45.367
I am about to have a truly awesome word
with someone.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.364
- Oh, my God.
- No, Penny, wait.

11:00.680 --> 11:02.364
You're all going to hell.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.605
Doctor.

11:04.680 --> 11:06.045
Here's a tip.

11:06.520 --> 11:07.726
When I'm on a date,

11:08.240 --> 11:12.450
when that rare and special thing
happens in my real life,

11:12.680 --> 11:16.765
do not, do not under any circumstances

11:16.880 --> 11:19.531
put the Pope in my bedroom.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.962
Okay. Now I know.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.846
Air cleared. Nardole will explain
what's going on.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.568
Uh, Doctor?

11:29.840 --> 11:34.164
It, uh...
I think it's pretty serious.

11:34.560 --> 11:36.688
- What's happened?
- Well...

11:38.960 --> 11:40.325
You know the Vatican?

11:41.600 --> 11:43.409
- Yeah.
- The one in Rome.

11:43.640 --> 11:45.130
That's in Italy.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.440
- Yeah.
- And what is that?

11:46.520 --> 11:48.682
- Where the Pope lives.
- It's a sort of, uh,

11:48.760 --> 11:50.091
a reading aid.

11:51.040 --> 11:52.451
It looks dangerous.

11:53.520 --> 11:54.965
Completely deadly.

11:55.040 --> 11:58.010
But, uh, you know,
swings and roundabouts...

11:58.400 --> 12:01.529
Pope Benedict said that you were more
in need of confession

12:01.600 --> 12:02.761
than any man breathing.

12:02.880 --> 12:04.803
But when the offer was made,

12:04.960 --> 12:06.769
you replied it would take too much time.

12:08.640 --> 12:12.361
On behalf of the Catholic Church,
the offer stands.

12:17.400 --> 12:20.768
You seem like a man with regret
on his mind.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.690
Have you requested a priest?

12:28.400 --> 12:29.640
Oh, I haven't.

12:32.480 --> 12:33.845
Apparently, I have.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.963
I shall seek consultation.

12:43.400 --> 12:46.882
There are 412 precedents
in the fatality index.

12:48.440 --> 12:52.001
Divine intervention therefore
is permitted for a maximum

12:52.080 --> 12:53.730
of five minutes.

12:53.800 --> 12:54.926
Five minutes.

12:55.320 --> 12:57.288
The executioner may now discuss

12:57.360 --> 13:00.489
his immortal soul
and any peril there unto.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.010
Greetings, sinner.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.811
Only in darkness are we revealed.

13:11.880 --> 13:13.689
I never sent for you.

13:13.760 --> 13:18.049
Goodness is not goodness
that seeks advantage.

13:18.240 --> 13:21.164
Good is good in the final hour.

13:21.320 --> 13:25.530
In the deepest pit, without hope,
without witness.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.040
Without reward.

13:27.600 --> 13:30.729
Virtue is only virtue in extremis.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.121
This is what he believes.

13:33.400 --> 13:36.643
And this is the reason above all,
I love him.

13:37.480 --> 13:40.563
My husband. My madman in a box.

13:40.680 --> 13:41.920
My Doctor.

13:47.520 --> 13:48.885
Your missus wouldn't approve.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.286
How the hell did you get here?

13:50.360 --> 13:51.521
Followed you from Darillium

13:51.600 --> 13:54.604
on the explicit orders
of your late wife, River Song.

13:54.720 --> 13:58.122
Warning, I have full permission
to kick your arse.

14:13.600 --> 14:17.207
Okay. So, you're blind
and you don't want your enemies to know.

14:17.320 --> 14:20.085
I get it. But why does it have to be
a secret from Bill?

14:20.360 --> 14:22.328
Because I don't like being
worried about.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.801
Around me, people should be worried
about themselves.

14:24.880 --> 14:27.281
- Yeah, shall I tell you the real reason?
- No.

14:27.360 --> 14:30.364
Because the moment you tell Bill,
it becomes real.

14:30.440 --> 14:32.602
And then you might
actually have to deal with it.

14:32.680 --> 14:35.524
Good point. Well made.
Definitely not telling her now.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.326
You're an idiot.

14:38.520 --> 14:40.045
Everyone knows that.

14:50.480 --> 14:52.209
Here you must go without me.

14:53.120 --> 14:55.202
Cardinal Angelo will conduct you
to the library.

14:58.400 --> 15:00.482
May God light your path.

15:01.680 --> 15:03.648
Well, we could certainly give it a go.

15:11.320 --> 15:13.971
The entrance to the Hereticum.

15:14.360 --> 15:18.331
The Library of forbidden
and heretical texts.

15:18.840 --> 15:22.447
First instituted by your old friend,
Pope Benedict,

15:24.240 --> 15:26.481
who still guards the door.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.891
You old dog.

15:48.120 --> 15:52.170
Very few know this place exists.

15:55.280 --> 15:57.044
The library of blasphemy.

15:57.120 --> 15:58.201
The Hereticum.

15:59.760 --> 16:01.000
Harry Potter.

16:01.080 --> 16:02.127
Language.

16:04.280 --> 16:07.250
Please stay close to me.

16:08.480 --> 16:12.690
The layout is designed
to confuse the uninitiated.

16:13.080 --> 16:14.366
Sort of like religion, really.

16:16.240 --> 16:17.844
You happy in those shades?

16:18.480 --> 16:19.925
Not dark enough for ya?

16:20.000 --> 16:21.604
In darkness, we are revealed.

16:26.200 --> 16:30.171
Remember, sinner,
in darkness we are revealed.

16:31.080 --> 16:32.411
I regret, gentlemen,

16:33.760 --> 16:35.569
this consultation is over.

16:35.640 --> 16:37.130
I regret it, too.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.641
The sentence must now be carried out.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.122
Well, take a few more minutes
if you like.

16:42.200 --> 16:46.250
Knock yourself out. Actually, do...
Do that. Knock yourself right out.

16:59.480 --> 17:01.289
I'll be good, I promise.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.562
I'll turn. I'll turn good. Please.

17:04.359 --> 17:06.407
Teach me. Teach me how to be...

17:06.960 --> 17:08.200
good.

17:10.079 --> 17:11.491
Without hope.

17:12.440 --> 17:13.646
Without witness.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.723
Without reward.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.050
Who was your date, then?

17:23.119 --> 17:26.089
Uh, Penny. Uh, it's a long story.

17:32.080 --> 17:34.082
The very centre
of the Hereticum.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.121
Home of the Veritas
for over a thousand years.

17:37.440 --> 17:39.568
Truth in the heart of heresy.

17:39.800 --> 17:42.770
And death in the heart of truth.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.887
You'd be wizard at writing
Christmas crackers, you two.

17:48.160 --> 17:50.242
- Doctor.
- What's that?

17:50.640 --> 17:52.165
I don't know.

17:53.440 --> 17:58.651
Oh, look, it's er, a mysterious light
shining round a corner

17:58.720 --> 18:00.848
approximately 10 feet away.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.321
Hello.

18:03.760 --> 18:04.761
Who's there?

18:06.920 --> 18:08.046
Doctor?

18:08.600 --> 18:10.045
This library is forbidden.

18:10.360 --> 18:11.771
- No, wait!
- Who are you?

18:14.040 --> 18:15.769
What are you doing here?

18:15.920 --> 18:16.967
Speak!

18:20.240 --> 18:21.765
Speak to me!

18:26.640 --> 18:28.051
What's through there?
What's through that door?

18:28.560 --> 18:30.801
There's no door there. It's a wall.

18:39.960 --> 18:42.645
Impossible. Quite impossible.

18:44.320 --> 18:46.163
Let's take a look at the Veritas.

18:46.320 --> 18:48.004
I have a feeling the answers
might be there.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.648
I have to check if there
is a breach in the wall.

18:51.520 --> 18:53.363
I'll unlock the cage in a moment.

18:54.320 --> 18:55.481
Sure.

19:13.280 --> 19:15.408
Oh, my God!

19:15.640 --> 19:16.846
What's wrong?

19:21.080 --> 19:22.241
Oh, hang on.

19:25.360 --> 19:26.566
I think there's someone in there.

19:27.120 --> 19:29.248
Yeah, we are very slightly getting that.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.086
I'm sorry.

19:32.760 --> 19:33.841
I'm sorry.

19:36.840 --> 19:37.887
I sent it.

19:39.600 --> 19:40.726
Sent what?

19:41.400 --> 19:42.686
I sent it, yes.

19:43.160 --> 19:44.400
Sent what? Where?

19:47.320 --> 19:48.810
No, stop!

19:49.200 --> 19:50.326
You'll just get lost.

19:50.640 --> 19:53.405
Cardinal Angelo, someone just broke
into your book cage.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.645
Priest, by the look of him.

19:57.160 --> 19:58.366
Shot out the lock.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.405
Oh, well, he hasn't got far.

20:03.640 --> 20:05.961
So much for your
forbidden library, Cardinal.

20:10.880 --> 20:11.927
Doctor, look at this.

20:12.600 --> 20:13.681
Must have been his.

20:14.440 --> 20:15.566
Laptop.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.051
Hey, there's Wi-Fi down here.

20:21.040 --> 20:23.361
Of course there's Wi-Fi. It's a library.

20:24.160 --> 20:25.844
Reading chair with a safety belt.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.440
What's CERN?

20:27.520 --> 20:28.521
- CERN?
- Yeah.

20:28.680 --> 20:30.523
The European Organisation
for Nuclear Research.

20:30.600 --> 20:33.683
The largest particle physics laboratory
on this planet. Why?

20:34.640 --> 20:37.371
Because four hours ago, someone,
that priest presumably,

20:37.440 --> 20:38.441
emailed them a copy

20:38.520 --> 20:41.000
of the Veritastranslation
from this computer.

20:41.160 --> 20:42.161
Remember what he said.

20:42.360 --> 20:43.361
He said, "I sent it."

20:44.920 --> 20:46.001
He sent the Veritas.

20:46.120 --> 20:48.407
- And CERN have just replied.
- What'd they say?

20:50.560 --> 20:51.607
"Pray for us."

20:51.720 --> 20:53.722
When do a bunch of scientists
ask for prayers?

20:53.920 --> 20:55.160
The same time anyone does.

20:56.040 --> 20:58.850
When they're very, very afraid.

20:59.720 --> 21:02.200
Particle physicists and priests.

21:03.040 --> 21:04.804
What could scare them both?

21:09.560 --> 21:12.131
He's been down here for a while,
that guy. Whoever he is.

21:12.280 --> 21:14.282
I'd guess the missing translator.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.689
- That's promising.
- "Promising"?

21:16.800 --> 21:19.246
Yeah. At least one person
read the Veritas and lived.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.404
Go and see if he's all right.
Both of you.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.011
I think we know he isn't.

21:29.920 --> 21:32.207
We know nothing of the kind.
He might need help.

21:33.040 --> 21:35.691
Might have useful information.
He's about 50 feet that way.

21:35.760 --> 21:38.127
- Are you trying to get rid of us?
- Why?

21:38.200 --> 21:40.328
Because you're sending us into the dark
after a man with a gun.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.448
- Ah, well, I thought of that.
- Thank you.

21:42.520 --> 21:44.409
Nardole, make sure you walk
in front of Bill.

21:44.480 --> 21:45.686
Oh, great.

21:45.840 --> 21:48.605
Are you gonna read this?
Is that why you're sending us off?

21:49.680 --> 21:52.251
- I won't read this without you.
- Really, he won't.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.209
- Promise?
- Trust me.

21:56.360 --> 21:57.691
We'll shout if we need you.

21:58.760 --> 21:59.921
Me too.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.642
Does it give you the fear
when he says, "Trust me"?

22:02.840 --> 22:04.888
If I worked here,
I'd cross meself.

22:14.960 --> 22:18.169
Bill, stay close by me.
There's a man with a gun.

22:22.880 --> 22:24.120
Uh-uh-uh.

22:25.400 --> 22:27.289
Yeah, you don't
actually have to do that.

22:27.560 --> 22:29.369
In fact, don't you dare do that.

22:29.680 --> 22:30.886
Uh-uh-uh, Bill.

22:31.480 --> 22:33.687
You're to walk behind me now,
like the Doctor said.

22:34.280 --> 22:36.726
Yeah. Totally not happening.

22:38.760 --> 22:40.649
Okay, Bill. Miss Potts.

22:41.240 --> 22:43.607
I'm the only person you've ever met
or will ever meet

22:43.680 --> 22:46.524
who is officially licensed
to kick the Doctor's arse.

22:46.600 --> 22:48.807
I will happily do the same to you
in the event

22:48.880 --> 22:52.089
that you do not align yourself
with any instructions I have issued,

22:52.160 --> 22:54.367
which I personally judge to be
in the best interest

22:54.440 --> 22:56.522
of your safety and survival.

22:57.800 --> 22:58.926
Okay, Bill?

22:59.200 --> 23:01.009
- Okay.
- Good-o!

23:02.800 --> 23:03.801
Nardole?

23:04.520 --> 23:06.045
Are you secretly a badass?

23:06.120 --> 23:08.009
Nothing secret about it, baby doll.

23:15.640 --> 23:17.449
Well,
that answers that question.

23:24.080 --> 23:26.651
It's an opening
like we saw before.

23:26.720 --> 23:28.370
Yeah, like a portal.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.843
- You're right.
- About what?

23:36.080 --> 23:38.082
It would be stupid to go and look.

24:17.600 --> 24:18.761
Cardinal Angelo.

24:19.120 --> 24:20.724
I could do with your help here.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.440
I'm not absolutely sure
how this is going to work.

24:24.920 --> 24:27.764
Either it's going to temporarily
fix my eyesight

24:27.840 --> 24:30.047
or it's going to burn out my brain.

24:32.680 --> 24:35.604
Just, uh, give me a moment.

24:52.400 --> 24:53.765
I am your friend.

24:55.640 --> 24:56.846
Makes no difference.

24:57.040 --> 24:58.280
I know it doesn't.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.690
I know I'm going to die.

25:01.080 --> 25:03.003
I have to say it. The truth.

25:04.840 --> 25:05.966
Without hope.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.045
Without witness.

25:09.440 --> 25:11.169
Without reward.

25:12.880 --> 25:15.690
I am your friend.

25:27.880 --> 25:30.884
On my oath as a Time Lord
of the Prydonian Chapter,

25:32.080 --> 25:33.809
I will guard this body

25:35.760 --> 25:37.171
for a thousand years.

25:58.840 --> 26:00.330
- Hello.
- Hello.

26:00.880 --> 26:01.881
Who are you?

26:02.120 --> 26:04.122
Do you have clearance for floor three?

26:04.320 --> 26:05.560
Floor three of what?

26:05.960 --> 26:06.961
Of what?

26:07.360 --> 26:08.361
Of what?

26:09.760 --> 26:11.091
The Pentagon.

26:24.480 --> 26:25.811
So, the Pentagon is through there.

26:26.040 --> 26:27.041
Yeah.

26:27.320 --> 26:32.087
And the Vatican
is through there.

26:32.560 --> 26:35.131
Huh. I wonder what's through here.

26:35.760 --> 26:36.841
What is this?

26:37.000 --> 26:39.446
- How is this possible?
- Alien technology.

26:39.840 --> 26:41.330
Let's see what else they got.

26:41.760 --> 26:44.764
Ooh. Bill, come and take a look at this.

26:54.240 --> 26:55.969
Oh, hello.

26:56.520 --> 26:57.806
Are... Are you coming?

26:58.720 --> 26:59.721
Coming where?

27:00.040 --> 27:02.088
Uh, we are all in the cafeteria.

27:02.200 --> 27:03.440
You mustn't miss it.

27:04.200 --> 27:05.247
Why?

27:06.600 --> 27:08.648
We're all going together when we go.

27:10.640 --> 27:13.120
Come on!

27:33.200 --> 27:35.885
Cardinal. It worked! I can see.

27:37.400 --> 27:39.084
Not well enough. Not yet.

27:42.560 --> 27:43.766
Think about the universes.

27:43.840 --> 27:46.127
Whatever you need,
you can always borrow.

27:46.880 --> 27:48.689
As long as you pay it back.

27:49.320 --> 27:52.210
I just borrowed from my future.

27:53.160 --> 27:56.084
I get a few minutes of proper eyesight

27:56.160 --> 27:58.322
but I lose something.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.927
Maybe all my future regenerations
will be blind.

28:01.280 --> 28:04.250
Maybe I won't regenerate ever again.

28:04.320 --> 28:06.482
Maybe I'll drop dead in 20 minutes,

28:07.800 --> 28:10.804
but I will be able to read this.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.402
Now, I have no idea
how that is going to affect me.

28:15.480 --> 28:18.006
So, I'd be a bit stupid

28:18.160 --> 28:20.367
to reject the precautions provided.

28:20.440 --> 28:22.329
Could you help me, please?

28:22.400 --> 28:23.401
Could you help me?

28:29.000 --> 28:32.049
Now, I've read a lot of books that
this chair would be quite useful for.

28:33.440 --> 28:37.240
Moby Dick. Honestly, shut up
and get to the whale.

28:42.240 --> 28:44.208
Have you invited friends and family?

28:50.960 --> 28:53.167
Oh, it's the old, old story.

28:54.080 --> 28:55.650
They never look so good in the morning.

28:58.600 --> 29:00.967
Goodbye to the truth.
I came a long way to read that book.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.769
Two thousand years at the last count.

29:05.400 --> 29:06.481
If you don't want me to read it,

29:06.560 --> 29:07.641
you could've stopped me
any time you wanted.

29:07.720 --> 29:09.961
Why the play acting? This is not a game.

29:10.040 --> 29:12.327
This is a game.

29:12.400 --> 29:13.731
Good, because I win!

29:15.400 --> 29:17.528
Doctor!

29:17.880 --> 29:19.882
Doctor!

29:29.280 --> 29:32.250
Doctor, we have the Veritas.

29:45.920 --> 29:47.331
Come, come, come, come.

29:48.160 --> 29:49.207
CERN.

29:49.280 --> 29:51.089
Where what's-his-name
sent the Veritas.

29:51.200 --> 29:52.406
Ladies and gentlemen.

29:54.240 --> 29:55.810
Your attention, please!

29:59.640 --> 30:01.404
I've been around everywhere

30:01.520 --> 30:03.124
and I've checked everything.

30:03.200 --> 30:04.406
It's all ready to go.

30:05.640 --> 30:06.801
Five minutes.

30:08.520 --> 30:10.568
Last orders, please.

30:20.880 --> 30:21.961
Cheers.

30:26.880 --> 30:28.928
Look under the tables.

30:40.680 --> 30:42.444
Oh, my God.

31:19.120 --> 31:20.610
Oh, no.

31:21.240 --> 31:22.401
Oh, no!

31:24.520 --> 31:26.329
No! Not yet!

31:26.520 --> 31:27.601
No!

31:27.920 --> 31:29.490
No, no, no, no!

32:12.720 --> 32:14.085
In vino veritas.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.929
Why are you doing this?

32:16.000 --> 32:17.240
You've got explosives.

32:17.320 --> 32:19.049
We're saving the world.

32:19.120 --> 32:20.963
You know, we should go.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.929
We should probably even run.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.241
How is blowing yourselves up
saving the world?

32:25.640 --> 32:28.325
Because this isn't the world.

32:28.920 --> 32:31.605
- This isn't what?
- Bill, time. Tiny bit running out.

32:32.680 --> 32:33.806
You haven't read it?

32:35.000 --> 32:36.684
You haven't read the Veritas?

32:36.760 --> 32:39.445
Sorry, I'd love to but must dash.

32:40.360 --> 32:41.771
Choose a number.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.048
Any number. Both of you.

32:45.400 --> 32:46.447
Now.

32:47.560 --> 32:50.404
And say it when I tap this table.

32:55.840 --> 32:57.126
36.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.809
Try again. Keep going.

33:04.080 --> 33:05.081
17.

33:05.160 --> 33:06.321
- Huh?
- Again.

33:06.400 --> 33:08.971
Don't stop. Every time I tap the table.

33:10.320 --> 33:11.367
9.

33:11.440 --> 33:12.851
48.

33:12.920 --> 33:14.604
103.

33:14.680 --> 33:16.011
A million.

33:16.080 --> 33:17.809
Seven billion and seven.

33:19.160 --> 33:20.241
67.

33:20.360 --> 33:22.249
905.

33:22.960 --> 33:25.088
20,460.

33:25.200 --> 33:26.964
Twelve.

33:27.040 --> 33:28.724
Four.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.882
87.

33:30.960 --> 33:32.325
702.

33:32.400 --> 33:34.368
What is this? How are you doing that?

33:34.440 --> 33:35.805
It's a test.

33:36.240 --> 33:37.730
It's a shadow test.

33:39.120 --> 33:41.646
Oh. I'm really very sorry.

33:50.200 --> 33:51.929
Ten, nine,

33:52.000 --> 33:55.083
eight, seven, six,

33:55.160 --> 34:00.485
five, four, three, two, one!

34:02.760 --> 34:05.001
Okay, what was that about?

34:05.080 --> 34:06.241
Those numbers, how did they do that?

34:06.320 --> 34:07.651
Ooh.

34:07.720 --> 34:09.085
Ooh.

34:09.159 --> 34:10.286
Oh!

34:10.360 --> 34:12.168
- You okay?
- No.

34:13.480 --> 34:14.606
Yes.

34:15.080 --> 34:16.127
No!

34:16.320 --> 34:18.800
Someone's been through here.

34:21.600 --> 34:23.011
Could be the Doctor.

34:24.800 --> 34:26.484
Those things.

34:27.040 --> 34:28.530
What do they look like?

34:28.600 --> 34:30.125
- Projectors.
- Exactly.

34:30.199 --> 34:32.089
- Exactly.
- Yeah, they're projecting the portals.

34:32.159 --> 34:33.366
No, they're not.

34:33.440 --> 34:34.565
They're projecting everything.

34:34.639 --> 34:37.120
Those worlds, they're all projected.

34:37.239 --> 34:39.846
The Pentagon, the Vatican, CERN...

34:39.920 --> 34:42.161
- They're not real?
- No, no! They're holograms.

34:42.239 --> 34:45.926
They're holographic simulations
and the people in them, too.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.445
Sorry, what?

34:47.520 --> 34:49.045
You know, like the holodeck on Star Trek

34:49.120 --> 34:51.202
or a really posh VR without a headset.

34:51.280 --> 34:54.806
Through there, those places,
that's basically Grand Theft Auto.

34:55.320 --> 34:56.446
It can't be.

34:56.520 --> 34:59.410
It is! Look at the tech!
It definitely is!

35:00.520 --> 35:02.284
What? Sorry,
you're not making any sense.

35:02.360 --> 35:04.169
When did we end up in a computer game?

35:04.240 --> 35:05.765
When did that start?

35:05.840 --> 35:09.049
I... I don't know. Maybe when we arrived
at the Vatican?

35:09.120 --> 35:11.168
But I programmed the TARDIS myself.

35:11.240 --> 35:12.969
We were on target,
we went to the Vatican,

35:13.040 --> 35:14.485
the real one, I'm sure of it.

35:15.960 --> 35:17.007
Oh.

35:17.440 --> 35:18.441
Oh?

35:18.800 --> 35:20.768
Those machines, they...

35:21.680 --> 35:23.284
project the simulations.

35:23.360 --> 35:24.725
Yeah?

35:25.080 --> 35:27.447
And I'm just wondering...

35:29.360 --> 35:31.283
What happens if

35:31.960 --> 35:35.169
We move outside
the light of the projector.

35:36.360 --> 35:38.089
Don't let me be right.

35:38.160 --> 35:40.891
Please don't let me be right.

35:47.920 --> 35:49.365
I'm part of it!

35:49.480 --> 35:51.209
I'm part of the simulation!

35:51.480 --> 35:53.721
Bill, I'm not real!

35:54.360 --> 35:56.089
Bill!

35:56.640 --> 35:58.130
Nardole!

36:15.240 --> 36:16.287
Doctor.

36:21.080 --> 36:22.161
Doctor?

36:55.040 --> 36:56.201
Bill, is that you?

36:58.400 --> 36:59.811
Hello, Doctor.

37:02.280 --> 37:03.691
Is that the president?

37:05.120 --> 37:06.281
It was.

37:13.640 --> 37:15.369
I take it he read the Veritas.

37:16.480 --> 37:17.641
So did I.

37:20.400 --> 37:21.606
Well...

37:22.480 --> 37:23.811
I listened to it.

37:24.040 --> 37:27.408
There's this thing on here that reads
aloud to you. It's very useful.

37:27.480 --> 37:28.970
Who needs Nardole?

37:31.680 --> 37:32.966
Where is Nardole?

37:37.720 --> 37:40.724
I need to know what's real
and what isn't real.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.928
- Don't we all?
- Don't play games.

37:43.520 --> 37:44.885
Tell me.

37:51.920 --> 37:53.081
Uh...

37:56.200 --> 37:57.884
The Veritas tells

37:59.040 --> 38:02.408
of an evil demon
who wants to conquer the world.

38:03.680 --> 38:05.170
But to do it,

38:05.720 --> 38:07.609
he needs to learn about it first.

38:07.760 --> 38:09.842
So he creates a shadow world.

38:10.880 --> 38:13.929
A world for him to practise conquering.

38:14.840 --> 38:17.047
Full of shadow people
who think they're real.

38:17.600 --> 38:19.841
There was a... A thing.

38:19.920 --> 38:21.126
The shadow test?

38:21.480 --> 38:23.562
If you're in doubt
whether you're real or not,

38:23.640 --> 38:27.042
the Veritas invites you to write down
as many numbers as you like.

38:27.120 --> 38:29.646
Of any size, any order.

38:30.400 --> 38:31.811
And then turn the page.

38:31.880 --> 38:34.804
All the same numbers in the same order.

38:35.320 --> 38:36.731
Yes.

38:41.640 --> 38:43.961
Let's bring the story up to date, Bill.

38:44.320 --> 38:46.721
Imagine an alien life form

38:46.800 --> 38:48.848
of immense power

38:49.800 --> 38:51.211
and sophistication,

38:51.400 --> 38:53.687
and it wants to conquer the Earth.

38:54.080 --> 38:56.242
So it runs a simulation.

38:56.600 --> 38:59.251
A holographic simulation

38:59.640 --> 39:04.771
of all of Earth's history
and every person alive on the surface,

39:04.840 --> 39:06.171
a practice Earth,

39:06.240 --> 39:10.564
to assess the abilities
of the resident population.

39:11.080 --> 39:14.084
Especially the ones
smart enough to realise

39:14.160 --> 39:16.367
that they are just simulants

39:16.440 --> 39:19.683
Inside a great big computer game.

39:20.760 --> 39:23.411
But... But this is... This... This...

39:23.480 --> 39:26.370
This... This is real. I... I feel it.

39:29.280 --> 39:31.806
Computers aren't good
with random numbers.

39:32.880 --> 39:35.167
If you ask a computer-simulated person

39:35.240 --> 39:37.811
to generate a random string of numbers,

39:37.880 --> 39:41.043
it won't truly be random.

39:42.960 --> 39:45.611
If all the simulated people

39:45.680 --> 39:48.490
are part of the same computer program,

39:48.560 --> 39:52.246
then they'll all generate
the same string.

39:52.760 --> 39:55.650
The exact same numbers.

39:55.720 --> 39:58.166
The... The numbers...

40:00.760 --> 40:03.047
I said them, too.

40:03.120 --> 40:04.565
I know.

40:06.320 --> 40:07.685
So did I.

40:08.960 --> 40:10.166
The trouble is,

40:10.360 --> 40:13.569
when simulants develop enough
independent intelligence

40:13.640 --> 40:15.642
to realise what they are,

40:15.720 --> 40:17.529
there's a risk they'll rebel.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.525
Those deaths...

40:20.120 --> 40:21.849
They weren't suicide.

40:21.960 --> 40:23.610
Those were people...

40:26.800 --> 40:27.926
escaping.

40:28.560 --> 40:32.121
It's like, um, Super Mario.

40:33.200 --> 40:35.202
Figuring out what's going on.

40:36.720 --> 40:38.643
Deleting himself from the game

40:39.720 --> 40:41.210
because he's sick of dying.

40:44.400 --> 40:46.880
No, I'm real. I feel real.

40:46.960 --> 40:48.371
Those pretend people

40:48.440 --> 40:51.171
you shoot at in computer games...

40:53.440 --> 40:55.442
- Now you know.
- Know what?

40:55.520 --> 40:56.726
They think they're real.

40:56.800 --> 40:58.165
They feel it.

40:59.480 --> 41:00.925
We feel it.

41:07.960 --> 41:09.291
Help me.

41:10.520 --> 41:11.567
Help me.

41:11.640 --> 41:13.529
Bill, what's happening to you?

41:14.120 --> 41:15.610
Save me.

41:22.520 --> 41:23.760
Bill, are you there?

41:23.840 --> 41:25.604
She was not real.

41:25.680 --> 41:27.523
You are not real.

41:27.600 --> 41:29.602
No, I'm not. I'm a shadow.

41:29.760 --> 41:32.889
A puppet doctor for you
to practise killing.

41:33.120 --> 41:36.283
We have killed you many times.

41:36.360 --> 41:38.408
Then what are you waiting for?
Why don't you kill me now?

41:38.480 --> 41:40.482
You suffer.

41:40.840 --> 41:43.605
Pain is information.

41:44.160 --> 41:47.004
Information will be gathered.

41:50.080 --> 41:51.320
Turn me off.

41:51.800 --> 41:52.961
Turn me off.

41:54.040 --> 41:55.121
I have nothing.

41:55.320 --> 41:56.481
Not even hope.

41:57.120 --> 41:58.201
Without hope.

42:00.320 --> 42:01.401
Without witness.

42:02.840 --> 42:04.365
Without reward.

42:12.880 --> 42:14.211
Funny.

42:17.080 --> 42:18.730
I don't believe much.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.963
I'm not sure I believe anything.

42:26.920 --> 42:28.649
But right now...

42:30.320 --> 42:32.288
belief is all I am.

42:36.280 --> 42:40.524
Virtue is only virtue in extremis.

42:41.960 --> 42:45.681
I take it that your intention
is to invade the Earth.

42:46.080 --> 42:49.050
The simulations have been run.

42:49.120 --> 42:51.122
The Earth will be ours.

42:51.200 --> 42:54.568
Well, consider this a warning.

42:55.120 --> 42:56.406
On the eve of war,

42:56.480 --> 42:58.562
I am the Doctor.

43:00.320 --> 43:01.560
I...

43:02.000 --> 43:04.241
am what stands between you and them!

43:04.640 --> 43:06.529
You are not the Doctor.

43:06.600 --> 43:07.840
You are not real.

43:07.960 --> 43:10.850
You don't have to be real
to be the Doctor.

43:11.920 --> 43:13.684
As long as you never give up.

43:16.440 --> 43:21.002
Long as you always trick
the bad guys into their own traps.

43:22.360 --> 43:24.169
And here's the trap you fell into.

43:24.240 --> 43:27.210
Your simulation is far too good.

43:31.360 --> 43:32.805
See these?

43:33.160 --> 43:34.685
They're set to record.

43:34.760 --> 43:36.205
I'm blind, you see.

43:36.600 --> 43:39.570
So I'm psychically wired into these.

43:39.640 --> 43:41.961
So my memory print
of the last few hours

43:42.040 --> 43:44.566
will still be intact on here.

43:44.640 --> 43:46.961
Information about you.

43:47.040 --> 43:51.045
You are not real.
There is nothing you can do.

43:54.080 --> 43:56.481
There's always one thing
you can do from inside a computer,

43:56.560 --> 43:59.643
even if you're a jumped up
little sub-routine, you can do it.

43:59.720 --> 44:00.767
You can always...

44:02.160 --> 44:03.286
e-mail.

44:07.360 --> 44:09.283
What are you doing?

44:09.640 --> 44:12.610
I'm doing what everybody does
when the world is in danger.

44:12.680 --> 44:14.011
I'm calling the Doctor.

44:14.080 --> 44:15.445
Pressing send.

44:52.880 --> 44:55.850
I'm doing it, I'm doing it.
The essay, I'm doing it.

44:55.920 --> 44:57.570
- Are you on a date?
- No.

44:57.640 --> 45:00.211
- Are you sure?
- I think I'd kind of notice.

45:00.280 --> 45:01.850
What about Penny?
Do you know a girl called Penny?

45:01.920 --> 45:03.843
- Well, yeah.
- What's she like?

45:03.920 --> 45:05.001
Out of my league.

45:05.080 --> 45:06.605
- No.
- Sorry, what?

45:06.680 --> 45:08.330
- No?
- No.

45:08.400 --> 45:09.481
What does that mean, "no"?

45:09.560 --> 45:11.369
It means I'm a scary
handsome genius from space

45:11.440 --> 45:13.442
and I'm telling you, no,
she's not out of your league.

45:13.520 --> 45:15.648
Okay, well,
maybe I'll call her tomorrow.

45:15.720 --> 45:17.449
- Call her tonight.
- Tonight?

45:17.520 --> 45:18.885
Something? coming, Bill.

45:18.960 --> 45:20.564
Something very big.

45:20.640 --> 45:23.405
And something possibly very, very bad.

45:23.480 --> 45:26.290
And I have the feeling
that we're gonna be fairly busy.

45:26.560 --> 45:28.289
Call her tonight.

45:44.080 --> 45:45.206
Listen.

45:45.280 --> 45:47.169
If it comes down to it,

45:47.240 --> 45:49.846
if you're all I've got left,
then I need your help.

45:49.920 --> 45:52.366
You said you were my friend.

45:55.720 --> 45:57.484
Oi! Get off!

45:59.040 --> 46:00.769
I've just been executed.

46:00.840 --> 46:02.444
Show a little respect.

46:02.560 --> 46:04.767
She's... She's alive.

46:04.840 --> 46:06.763
I was just a bit sleepy, all right?

46:06.840 --> 46:09.491
Let's not split hairs. Shut up.

46:12.320 --> 46:13.526
Night-night.

46:13.640 --> 46:15.449
Of course she's not dead.

46:15.520 --> 46:18.922
She's a friend of mine. I may have
fiddled with your wiring a little bit.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.286
You swore an oath.

46:20.360 --> 46:23.045
I swore an oath I'd look after
her body for a thousand years.

46:23.120 --> 46:24.326
Nobody mentioned dead.

46:24.400 --> 46:26.084
You cannot do this.

46:26.160 --> 46:28.128
You will not leave this planet alive.

46:28.200 --> 46:29.611
Do me a favour,

46:29.680 --> 46:31.967
the fatality index,
look up "The Doctor".

46:32.040 --> 46:35.761
You have an entry
just like any other sentient being.

46:35.840 --> 46:37.285
Under "cause of death".

46:42.920 --> 46:44.922
You do seem to have, uh,

46:45.240 --> 46:47.208
an impressive record

46:47.400 --> 46:49.846
of fatalities credited to you.

46:53.680 --> 46:55.364
A truly remarkable record.

46:57.480 --> 46:58.561
Where are you going?

46:58.640 --> 46:59.971
He's unarmed.

47:00.400 --> 47:02.482
- You are unarmed.
- Always.

47:06.840 --> 47:08.001
You stand alone?

47:08.080 --> 47:09.127
Often.

47:09.200 --> 47:10.929
You're the one who should be afraid.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.081
Never.

47:12.440 --> 47:13.851
Have a nice day then.

47:17.200 --> 47:20.090
Nardole, help me move Missy
to the vault.

47:24.800 --> 47:26.484
Something's coming, Missy,

47:26.600 --> 47:28.125
and I'm blind.

47:28.360 --> 47:30.203
How can I save them

47:30.280 --> 47:32.123
when I'm lost in the dark?

48:12.640 --> 48:14.005
Tell me what you see.

48:14.080 --> 48:15.525
It's a 5,000-year-old pyramid.

48:15.640 --> 48:18.211
One little problem,
it wasn't there yesterday.

48:18.280 --> 48:20.442
Those creatures in
that pyramid, they have studied you.

48:20.520 --> 48:24.002
And they have chosen this exact moment
and this exact place.

48:25.160 --> 48:26.400
What's wrong with the Doctor?

48:26.520 --> 48:29.205
I lied. I've been blind
since Chasm Forge.

48:30.120 --> 48:31.451
Co-ordinate your attacks.

48:31.520 --> 48:32.965
It did not come here in peace.

48:33.040 --> 48:35.884
We will take this planet
and its people.

48:36.000 --> 48:40.847
Life on Earth will cease
by humanity's own hand.
