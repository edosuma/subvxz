01:30.424 --> 01:31.425
Nice!

01:38.015 --> 01:42.060
My old man used to say
he wanted me to better myself.

01:42.144 --> 01:43.187
I love you.

01:44.313 --> 01:47.191
But I could see in his eyes he didn't.

01:49.651 --> 01:50.652
"Better myself."

01:52.529 --> 01:54.573
-No.
-I got you.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.992
Nice, Jimmy. Way to get off the line.

01:57.075 --> 01:58.368
Attaboy!

02:00.871 --> 02:01.955
Gremlin.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.791
You know what they never tell you?

02:05.501 --> 02:08.669
They don't tell you
that the love of your life…

02:10.172 --> 02:11.590
could be your child.

02:14.760 --> 02:18.347
Are you a threat to the mental health
of any of my patients?

02:18.430 --> 02:21.642
Are you a threat?

02:22.142 --> 02:24.561
Hi. Where are you heading off to?

02:26.438 --> 02:27.564
Just gonna go home.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.149
You can't. You promised.

02:29.233 --> 02:30.692
I never promised anything.

02:30.776 --> 02:31.777
You did.

02:33.737 --> 02:34.738
You did.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.033
You promised.

02:44.081 --> 02:45.082
Hey, James.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.166
What?

02:52.381 --> 02:53.382
James.

02:56.301 --> 02:57.469
Hey, James.

02:57.970 --> 02:59.012
James.

03:06.019 --> 03:09.690
You were having some dream.

03:12.943 --> 03:14.194
Did I say anything?

03:14.278 --> 03:17.614
No. But it did make me think
that my stories yesterday

03:17.698 --> 03:19.700
may have given you some nightmares.

03:24.872 --> 03:25.873
Stories?

03:29.084 --> 03:30.544
That's what they are.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.046
Sometimes I do that.

03:34.506 --> 03:35.799
Lie to your friends?

03:37.259 --> 03:38.093
Huh?

03:39.094 --> 03:40.387
What? No.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.014
Well, you just said you lied to me.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.898
So either you lie to your friends,

03:50.981 --> 03:54.359
or you lie to people
who aren't your friends,

03:54.443 --> 03:57.905
which pretty much tells me
where I stand either way.

03:58.989 --> 04:00.115
That's not it.

04:01.575 --> 04:02.576
Okay.

04:04.703 --> 04:05.704
All right…

04:06.705 --> 04:07.831
All right, look, it's--

04:07.915 --> 04:11.251
Relax, Larry. I'm not surprised.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.428
What are you saying?

04:23.055 --> 04:26.141
I guess if I'd given it more thought,
I would have realized you were lying.

04:26.225 --> 04:29.853
It's not lying. It's storytelling.
I'm not a liar. I'm a raconteur.

04:30.521 --> 04:31.855
Look, whatever.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.733
Your details were off,
and God's in the details.

04:38.028 --> 04:41.281
Okay. What "details?"

04:43.408 --> 04:45.619
-You said you grew up digging graves.
-I did.

04:46.245 --> 04:49.498
Yet you didn't dig one for Jessica Roach.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.296
See?
That's how I know you're full of shit.

05:00.050 --> 05:05.180
Then you would know
that you need to dig a grave

05:05.264 --> 05:07.850
in the right kind of soil.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.226
Yeah.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.812
And it's hard to find in the dark.

05:11.895 --> 05:13.021
Of course.

05:13.105 --> 05:17.484
And this man, he pulled up
on the road across from my van.

05:17.568 --> 05:19.820
Yeah, that guy. He keeps showing up.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.910
I meant to go back.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.871
I just didn't have the time to do it.

05:28.954 --> 05:32.165
Larry. It's okay.

05:35.586 --> 05:37.212
-It's not.
-It's fine.

05:37.296 --> 05:41.008
Everybody in here tells stories.
I tell everybody I played for OSU--

05:41.091 --> 05:42.134
It's not!

05:45.637 --> 05:46.638
I--

05:54.021 --> 05:56.190
I'm telling the truth.

05:57.983 --> 05:59.443
You just said it was a story.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.236
That was the lie.

06:01.320 --> 06:02.487
That was?

06:02.571 --> 06:03.572
Yeah.

06:08.952 --> 06:13.040
I'm not lying, James.

06:23.926 --> 06:25.511
You're not a killer, man.

06:25.594 --> 06:27.012
I am.

06:28.013 --> 06:29.848
I've looked into the eyes of a few.

06:32.518 --> 06:34.061
And you don't have those eyes.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.611
What eyes do I have?

06:45.906 --> 06:46.907
A wannabe's.

06:53.497 --> 06:56.250
-Meet me in the woodshop later.
-Why?

07:00.254 --> 07:02.673
I wanna show you what kind of eyes I have.

07:05.300 --> 07:06.426
Chow, maggots.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.045
Shut the fuck up!

08:23.879 --> 08:25.589
You could always request PC.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.105
Might as well open up, Jim.

08:54.076 --> 08:55.160
Mind if I come in?

08:55.244 --> 08:56.954
I'd rather come out.

09:09.132 --> 09:10.342
Where's your girlfriend?

09:11.134 --> 09:13.220
Is he the one you're supposed to rat on?

09:15.222 --> 09:17.057
Cause I would support that.

09:20.018 --> 09:24.147
A kid killer? You kidding me, Jim?
I would have your back on that.

09:25.148 --> 09:27.401
-Yeah?
-I'd be your true blue, bud.

09:30.571 --> 09:31.738
What would it cost me?

09:32.656 --> 09:33.657
Nothing.

09:35.409 --> 09:36.410
Really.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.620
Some things are bigger than us

09:38.704 --> 09:41.874
and we can all agree
that motherfucker has to get got.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.424
So who would we be working for?

09:55.095 --> 09:56.722
You mean who am I working for?

09:59.016 --> 10:03.228
Yes, but we'd be in this together.

10:03.312 --> 10:07.524
And maybe, if I did good,
it would be like an audition for me.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.610
And I can get a job with the Marshals.

10:12.321 --> 10:15.032
Well, if I was working for the Marshals,
maybe.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.408
So who you working for?

10:21.580 --> 10:23.415
I tell you what, Mr. Carter.

10:23.498 --> 10:24.499
What?

10:26.210 --> 10:27.836
You call off the dogs for a week--

10:29.254 --> 10:30.923
Why would I do that, Jim?

10:34.426 --> 10:36.678
-So I know you can.
-And you'll do what?

10:40.974 --> 10:43.227
-Tell you who I'm working for.
-So, tell me.

10:43.894 --> 10:47.314
A week from now.
If I'm still walking upright.

10:49.525 --> 10:51.109
That's not…

10:52.319 --> 10:54.321
That's not how our relationship works,
Jim.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.323
I don't think you can call anyone off.

10:56.406 --> 10:57.908
How you gonna call me off you?

11:03.080 --> 11:04.998
Well, you fucked with my phone calls.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.752
And you already put a snitch jacket on me.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.258
What else you gonna do?

11:15.592 --> 11:17.469
-You don't wanna find that out.
-Yeah.

11:22.099 --> 11:23.141
I do.

11:31.066 --> 11:32.109
Okay then.

11:33.318 --> 11:34.444
Enjoy your day.

11:36.488 --> 11:37.531
Savor it.

11:45.247 --> 11:46.915
-I was on the phone.
-Yep.

11:46.999 --> 11:49.084
On hold for three fucking hours.

11:49.543 --> 11:50.544
Three hour--

11:51.461 --> 11:55.507
I didn't even know that
if it's breakfast or lunch anymore.

11:55.591 --> 11:56.717
It's lunch.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.386
And all--

12:00.304 --> 12:01.305
Here you go.

12:01.597 --> 12:06.602
All to tell me to call back tomorrow
to talk to the one guy,

12:06.685 --> 12:11.231
the one guy who can let me know
why Jimmy's funds were frozen.

12:11.315 --> 12:13.817
Well, you know,
maybe you could drive out there again

12:13.901 --> 12:15.527
and sit and stare at the prison.

12:15.611 --> 12:16.820
Come on. Stop.

12:17.988 --> 12:19.781
This is fucking serious.

12:19.865 --> 12:21.491
I know. What are you having?

12:25.579 --> 12:26.622
A churger.

12:27.831 --> 12:31.210
-What?
-The cheeserburger.

12:31.293 --> 12:32.503
No, you said "churger."

12:34.046 --> 12:35.839
-I did?
-Yeah.

12:36.507 --> 12:38.592
Hi, folks.
Can I get you something to start?

12:38.842 --> 12:42.179
Hi. Yeah. I'll have ice tea.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.263
Hon?

12:45.516 --> 12:48.894
A coff of cuppee, and a churger.

12:49.978 --> 12:52.523
The-- I don't know, the cheese--. Fuck.

12:52.606 --> 12:54.650
Call 911. He's having a stroke.

12:54.733 --> 12:55.901
-Oh, God.
-What?

12:55.984 --> 12:57.611
-911.
-Okay.

12:57.694 --> 12:58.695
Okay.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.948
It's okay. Okay.

13:01.698 --> 13:02.699
Oh, God.

13:03.909 --> 13:04.993
911!

13:33.939 --> 13:37.484
Good friend of mine
got the pancreatic cancer.

13:39.862 --> 13:41.947
Doctor said he'd be dead in four months.

13:44.491 --> 13:50.372
A week later he slipped walking up
some icy steps of a church, mind you,

13:51.623 --> 13:53.333
and hit his fucking head.

13:55.502 --> 13:59.590
Died right there in front
of his wife, one of his kids.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.553
Know what his last words were

14:06.013 --> 14:09.683
before he bled out all over the steps
of St. Augustine's?

14:20.027 --> 14:24.364
"You just… never fucking know."

15:55.914 --> 15:57.249
How'd you get in here?

15:58.792 --> 16:00.002
Door was open.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.634
What you working on?

16:15.058 --> 16:16.435
James.

16:20.522 --> 16:21.732
I finished them.

16:27.404 --> 16:30.324
Twenty-one? Why?

16:32.743 --> 16:34.119
Because I like to carve.

16:36.079 --> 16:39.041
No. Why 21?

16:40.250 --> 16:42.336
Why not 20 or an even two dozen?

16:49.343 --> 16:51.720
Like, I carve well. See?

16:58.894 --> 17:00.896
It's too bad I don't paint well.

17:02.523 --> 17:04.107
I'll leave that to Gary.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.319
Gary paints them black.

17:08.904 --> 17:10.948
Blacker than any black you've ever seen.

17:13.492 --> 17:14.701
Shipping these to Gary?

17:16.869 --> 17:17.871
Home, yeah.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.836
Do you know what they're for, James?

17:26.296 --> 17:27.339
No.

17:31.969 --> 17:33.303
They watch over the dead.

17:38.308 --> 17:40.185
They guard their spirits

17:41.311 --> 17:42.688
to make sure they're okay.

17:50.571 --> 17:52.573
These are the eyes you wanted me to see?

17:53.448 --> 17:55.158
Well, there's these too.

17:59.496 --> 18:00.497
Right.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.209
You know, James.

18:06.420 --> 18:09.214
You thinking that I was a liar,

18:10.382 --> 18:12.718
that made me sick to my stomach.

18:14.178 --> 18:17.806
Because then maybe you'd think
that I don't take what I do seriously.

18:19.391 --> 18:22.644
There's a care
that should be taken.

18:23.145 --> 18:26.732
That's what I'm saying.
It shouldn't be casual.

18:27.357 --> 18:32.779
You know, not like your 80 women
you've been with.

18:32.863 --> 18:35.032
No. I'm sorry to say,

18:35.115 --> 18:38.452
but you probably don't remember
some of their names.

18:40.454 --> 18:44.249
Maybe their body parts start to blur.

18:46.793 --> 18:47.920
Am I wrong?

18:51.256 --> 18:52.549
It was just sex, Larry.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.219
It's never just sex.

18:55.719 --> 18:57.137
Never just anything.

18:59.598 --> 19:02.226
Every interaction you have
with a person means something.

19:02.309 --> 19:04.269
We-- That's what we owe to the…

19:06.063 --> 19:07.356
to the world.

19:07.439 --> 19:08.440
To history.

19:08.524 --> 19:10.526
Sometimes it's just sex.

19:10.609 --> 19:11.610
No.

19:14.112 --> 19:16.573
If every interaction
with another person had the same weight

19:16.657 --> 19:18.575
we'd all go insane, Larry.

19:20.702 --> 19:23.413
No. You fucking hear me?

19:23.497 --> 19:24.998
No.

19:26.083 --> 19:27.876
Shut the fuck up and listen to me.

19:29.378 --> 19:30.879
We are part of something.

19:32.214 --> 19:36.093
I am a part of something.

19:37.427 --> 19:39.972
When I folded those clothes,

19:40.556 --> 19:44.309
that was an act of kindness from a…

19:46.186 --> 19:47.187
a deity.

19:50.148 --> 19:51.191
Whose clothes?

19:53.610 --> 19:54.903
Who are we talking about?

19:59.366 --> 20:01.201
Tricia Reitler's.

20:04.621 --> 20:06.415
Everyone was looking for her.

20:07.833 --> 20:08.834
They still are.

20:10.544 --> 20:12.129
She got in your van too?

20:19.511 --> 20:20.804
She was a handful.

20:22.055 --> 20:23.640
She punched like a man.

20:24.224 --> 20:27.019
And I didn't wanna stab her, James.

20:27.102 --> 20:31.273
I didn't stab her…
because I was going to stab her.

20:31.356 --> 20:33.692
I stabbed her
to stop her from hitting me. Man.

20:38.447 --> 20:39.781
But that didn't work.

20:40.991 --> 20:43.076
She just kept on trying to hurt me.

20:45.329 --> 20:46.538
I had to choke her.

20:49.875 --> 20:51.460
You stabbed her and choked her?

20:51.543 --> 20:53.754
Such a nasty fucking girl.

20:53.837 --> 20:57.925
I must have passed out.
When I woke up, there she was lying there.

20:58.008 --> 20:59.134
Naked and all.

21:01.720 --> 21:02.763
No pulse.

21:04.932 --> 21:08.435
But to your point, James. To your point…

21:13.232 --> 21:15.150
I did dig her grave.

21:16.193 --> 21:17.736
I know you made fun of me earlier.

21:17.819 --> 21:22.616
But I've dug hundreds of graves
since I was a child.

21:24.117 --> 21:27.162
Probably more than you've had women.

21:27.663 --> 21:31.542
I'm serious. I have dug more than you've…

21:37.130 --> 21:38.131
Was that 80?

21:44.012 --> 21:45.681
I've dug more than you've fucked.

21:46.974 --> 21:50.394
I've dug in the cold.
I've dug in the boiling heat.

21:52.563 --> 21:54.898
I've dug in the rainfall.

21:56.441 --> 21:59.027
It turned the soil into oatmeal.

21:59.528 --> 22:01.655
I know a good grave.

22:02.364 --> 22:03.949
I do, James.

22:04.032 --> 22:06.201
And Tricia's was one of the best
I ever did.

22:06.285 --> 22:07.911
No one will ever find that one.

22:13.333 --> 22:14.668
But you know where it is.

22:16.962 --> 22:18.505
I know where all of them are.

22:21.842 --> 22:24.469
Everybody wants the same thing
in this life.

22:29.141 --> 22:30.392
To be seen.

22:36.732 --> 22:38.525
Well, I see them, James.

22:38.609 --> 22:40.110
I give them that.

22:40.194 --> 22:45.199
And so long as my life continues on,
theirs has meaning.

22:48.118 --> 22:49.244
It has--

22:50.454 --> 22:52.206
Five minutes, guys.

23:03.759 --> 23:05.052
You could do more.

23:07.304 --> 23:08.430
I don't follow.

23:10.933 --> 23:15.437
You could give them peace,

23:15.938 --> 23:18.106
their families anyway.

23:19.983 --> 23:21.401
You could give them the map.

23:24.696 --> 23:25.697
The map?

23:26.406 --> 23:27.407
Yeah.

23:30.369 --> 23:31.370
But why?

23:35.332 --> 23:36.542
So they could sleep.

23:38.502 --> 23:39.628
Bury their dead.

23:40.796 --> 23:43.382
If you've given them their peace,

23:45.467 --> 23:48.053
and you've given the daughters your…

23:48.887 --> 23:50.430
Your--

23:50.514 --> 23:53.684
If I give them my seeing-- my witness.

23:53.767 --> 23:58.397
Then everything will be okay.

23:59.022 --> 24:01.692
Everything is okay. Everything is bliss.

24:03.944 --> 24:06.655
If you've given them your seeing

24:07.531 --> 24:10.367
then the parents would have the--

24:10.450 --> 24:13.662
the knowing of where their girls are.

24:15.330 --> 24:16.498
They could move on.

24:17.916 --> 24:20.169
James, you're not thinking clearly.

24:20.252 --> 24:22.546
If I did that,
then I would never get out of here.

24:23.422 --> 24:24.798
You could.

24:24.882 --> 24:28.302
What if someone could send the--

24:28.385 --> 24:32.347
the locations of the girls
to the authorities, like, anonymously?

24:35.100 --> 24:36.143
Why?

24:36.226 --> 24:37.644
They just did.

24:37.728 --> 24:41.899
Then the families would know.
They would have that.

24:45.944 --> 24:48.030
But why should they have that?

24:49.531 --> 24:53.577
Because they're probably hurting
pretty bad, Larry.

25:05.005 --> 25:06.632
James!

25:07.674 --> 25:10.010
James.

25:10.093 --> 25:12.638
You're fucking with me.
You're always fucking with me.

25:12.721 --> 25:13.972
Just like Gary.

25:15.098 --> 25:16.099
Oh, my God.

25:19.269 --> 25:21.647
You gotta give these people some release.

25:24.107 --> 25:26.026
What did you say? Say that again?

25:32.199 --> 25:33.784
Give these people some release.

25:38.247 --> 25:39.289
Never.

25:40.832 --> 25:41.834
Why?

25:46.255 --> 25:50.342
Because, James,
I'm going to win my appeal.

25:51.552 --> 25:56.348
And I'm going walk right out those doors
and keep on living my life.

26:10.988 --> 26:12.656
You're not gonna win your appeal.

26:18.704 --> 26:23.834
No fucking way!

26:32.467 --> 26:33.844
James, why are you acting--

26:33.927 --> 26:35.429
You'll never get out of here.

26:37.139 --> 26:39.308
You kill children
who cry for their mothers.

26:40.976 --> 26:44.479
You demented fucking monster!

26:48.609 --> 26:50.569
Beaumont sent you, didn't he?

26:54.364 --> 26:55.782
He did, didn't he?

27:00.162 --> 27:01.788
-Beaumont, sent you!
-Guard!

27:02.748 --> 27:04.124
Beaumont sent you.

27:04.875 --> 27:06.877
Beaumont sent you, didn't he?

27:06.960 --> 27:08.670
-Hey!
-You fuck!

27:10.797 --> 27:12.382
-Fuck you!
-Break it up!

27:12.466 --> 27:15.260
You cunt fucking whore!

27:15.344 --> 27:18.138
Beaumont sent you! Fuck you!

27:18.222 --> 27:19.806
Go fuck your mother!

27:19.890 --> 27:22.851
I know
you've already fucking thought about it!

27:22.935 --> 27:24.811
-Settle down!
-Fuck!

27:41.954 --> 27:43.956
I need to talk to Dr. Zicherman.

27:45.624 --> 27:47.000
No, tonight.

27:48.085 --> 27:49.336
Ain't happening.

27:49.419 --> 27:51.547
How about a phone call? Just a quick one.

27:52.840 --> 27:54.716
Phone call? Convict, please.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.510
Ain't no phone call happening either.

27:57.344 --> 27:58.345
Please.

27:59.471 --> 28:02.307
Look, I'll hook you up
in the morning. All right?

28:03.350 --> 28:04.393
Thank you.

29:23.514 --> 29:25.766
-No. I need Dr. Zicherman.
-Calm down.

29:25.849 --> 29:27.643
-Get me Dr. Zich-- No!
-Come on.

29:27.726 --> 29:30.437
His number is 6-1-2-5-7-1-1.

29:30.521 --> 29:33.482
His number is 6-1-2-5-7-1-1.

29:33.565 --> 29:36.318
That's it! That's all I need. That's it!

29:36.401 --> 29:39.238
6-1-2-5-7-1-1.

29:39.321 --> 29:41.949
No. Okay. Just let me talk to the warden.

29:42.032 --> 29:45.494
-Let me talk to the fucking warden!
-Shut the fuck up!

29:45.577 --> 29:47.246
-Shut the fuck up!
-No!

29:47.329 --> 29:48.330
Get in.

29:51.083 --> 29:53.502
No!

29:56.421 --> 29:58.966
Hey. I just need a pencil.

29:59.049 --> 30:02.219
If you want another blanket,
another pillow, more toilet paper,

30:02.302 --> 30:05.097
you gotta do us a huge favor
and shut the fuck up, Convict.

30:05.597 --> 30:06.890
No, I--

31:03.363 --> 31:06.366
I need a pen. A pencil.
A fucking crayon, anything!

31:06.450 --> 31:07.659
Come back, please!

31:07.743 --> 31:09.536
Please, come back!

31:23.467 --> 31:24.801
If I could just use a pencil.

31:24.885 --> 31:27.012
You can even stand here with me
while I use--

32:07.553 --> 32:09.221
Bodily fluids, they all--

32:10.097 --> 32:13.851
They all serve, like,
a different function, every one of them.

32:13.934 --> 32:18.856
Like, saliva has one purpose,
and blood another.

33:56.787 --> 33:57.996
He do that all day?

33:59.790 --> 34:00.791
Depends.

34:02.793 --> 34:04.169
That much to burn, huh?

34:04.711 --> 34:08.047
Sometimes, yeah.
Just scrub, lots of dead flowers.

34:08.549 --> 34:12.511
Mostly, though, he's just in the habit.
Likes staring into the fire, drinking.

34:16.098 --> 34:17.349
We met a few years ago.

34:17.431 --> 34:18.809
-I remember.
-Yeah.

34:18.891 --> 34:19.935
Remember her too.

34:22.855 --> 34:23.856
Brian Miller.

34:25.023 --> 34:29.820
Lauren McCauley, FBI.
I didn't think you lived here anymore.

34:30.404 --> 34:31.697
I don't.

34:31.780 --> 34:33.407
Come back to help out now and again.

34:34.574 --> 34:36.326
You do something different with your hair?

34:37.703 --> 34:38.704
No.

34:38.786 --> 34:40.163
Color it? Nothing?

34:40.998 --> 34:41.998
Nope.

34:44.668 --> 34:45.960
You look good.

34:46.920 --> 34:50.424
That's nice of you to say, Gary.
Maybe we could all talk inside?

34:51.757 --> 34:52.967
You got a warrant?

34:57.514 --> 34:58.765
Then enjoy the fresh air.

35:24.291 --> 35:25.626
Got manners around here.

35:36.553 --> 35:37.554
Thanks.

35:38.222 --> 35:39.223
You're welcome.

35:44.770 --> 35:47.356
You already got him locked up
the rest of his life.

35:48.315 --> 35:49.691
Not if he makes his appeal.

35:49.775 --> 35:50.776
Yeah.

35:50.859 --> 35:54.196
Well, you ain't never had shit on him
but a lot of conjecture.

35:54.279 --> 35:55.948
No, we got two confessions.

35:56.031 --> 35:58.534
Yeah, "coerced" was the word
his lawyer used.

35:58.617 --> 36:00.494
One court's agreed.
You wouldn't be here bothering us

36:00.577 --> 36:02.788
if you didn't think his second appeal's
gonna go the same way.

36:02.871 --> 36:04.289
And then he'll be back home.

36:08.335 --> 36:09.461
Yeah.

36:09.545 --> 36:11.171
Up to his old tricks.

36:14.508 --> 36:16.552
He'll get his old job back and be fine.

36:16.635 --> 36:21.473
Yeah. Maybe meet a nice girl,
settle down, raise a family.

36:21.557 --> 36:22.558
Hey.

36:23.141 --> 36:25.477
-What?
-Just don't.

36:25.561 --> 36:27.354
-Don't what?
-Don't make fun of me and mine.

36:27.437 --> 36:30.691
-No one's making fun of you, Gary.
-No, sure you are. Talking shit.

36:30.774 --> 36:33.110
"Larry's gonna live a normal life.
Have a wife and kids."

36:33.193 --> 36:34.945
What makes you think he won't?

36:38.073 --> 36:39.616
Yeah, you want me to say

36:39.700 --> 36:41.910
because my brother ain't capable
of having a normal home life,

36:41.994 --> 36:43.245
that means he kills people?

36:43.829 --> 36:44.997
Well, does he?

36:46.707 --> 36:49.334
Look, Larry's done
some terrible things, sure. Who hasn't?

36:50.335 --> 36:52.004
But he ain't never killed no one.

36:52.546 --> 36:56.258
He's just so desperate
someone see him once in his life.

36:57.593 --> 36:58.927
See him as a what?

36:59.011 --> 37:00.012
A person.

37:00.596 --> 37:03.807
Someone who can be funny,
smart, fucking helpful to people.

37:06.977 --> 37:10.898
I know you love your brother, Gary,
but he killed those girls.

37:10.981 --> 37:11.857
No.

37:11.940 --> 37:13.192
I think you know that.

37:41.261 --> 37:42.387
That's for you.

37:43.847 --> 37:45.182
These, mine.

37:46.558 --> 37:49.019
He's the person in those pictures,
not some beast.

37:51.772 --> 37:52.940
Go on, look through it.

38:01.490 --> 38:05.619
You've been quiet.
We reward quiet.

38:06.703 --> 38:09.957
You need anything? Anything at all?

38:12.334 --> 38:13.669
But don't say a pencil.

38:23.095 --> 38:27.516
I'm not crazy
like some of the people in here.

38:28.851 --> 38:30.477
You never struck me that way.

38:30.561 --> 38:34.022
I was sent here
to get a confession from Inmate Hall.

38:34.523 --> 38:36.066
What kind of confession?

38:36.567 --> 38:38.026
He kills girls.

38:38.110 --> 38:40.404
I was sent here to find out
where he buries them,

38:40.487 --> 38:42.948
and I saw a map and I--

38:43.031 --> 38:45.284
-Who sent you to do this?
-The FBI.

38:45.367 --> 38:46.869
-The FBI.
-Yes.

38:46.952 --> 38:48.996
-I have to get a message to them.
-To the FBI?

38:49.079 --> 38:50.455
Yes.

38:50.539 --> 38:52.749
Before I can't remember
where the bodies are.

38:53.959 --> 38:55.836
Before I can't help the parents.

38:59.548 --> 39:00.883
Before I'm no use.

39:02.467 --> 39:04.720
-Your name's Jim, right?
-Yes, Jimmy.

39:04.803 --> 39:06.847
-Yes.
-Jimmy.

39:08.265 --> 39:12.227
Don't you ever say "FBI" to me again.
You hear me?

39:14.938 --> 39:17.733
-Fucking answer me.
-Yes, I hear you.

39:21.778 --> 39:24.072
Like you guys
in these soapbox cars you made.

39:24.156 --> 39:25.199
What are you, 12?

39:25.282 --> 39:26.283
Eleven.

39:27.367 --> 39:31.830
Yeah, Larry made those.
Man's a magician with anything mechanical.

39:36.126 --> 39:37.586
Where'd your dad go?

39:39.338 --> 39:42.216
Fuck knows. Wandering, drinking.

39:43.842 --> 39:46.261
Pinching a watch off a corpse.
Shit like that.

39:46.345 --> 39:48.430
Your mom? She still with us?

39:48.514 --> 39:49.806
Yeah, she's inside.

39:49.890 --> 39:52.684
Gotta-- Can't get around much no more.

39:52.768 --> 39:57.439
She got the bed and the Barcalounger
and a toilet in the same room.

39:58.774 --> 40:00.234
Works for her.

40:00.317 --> 40:01.318
Sick?

40:01.902 --> 40:03.028
Fat.

40:07.908 --> 40:10.035
What "terrible things?"

40:11.203 --> 40:13.956
You said, "We've all done terrible things,
even Larry."

40:14.039 --> 40:15.874
I was just wondering
what those things were.

40:15.958 --> 40:17.793
What?
So you can arrest him for something else?

40:17.876 --> 40:19.419
No, I was just wondering, Gary.

40:19.503 --> 40:22.756
You ain't never done nothing terrible
in your life? You above all that?

40:24.424 --> 40:28.095
You weren't talking about
general things I could have done, Gary.

40:29.721 --> 40:32.266
You were talking about
a specific thing Larry did.

40:34.852 --> 40:35.853
No.

40:47.906 --> 40:49.491
Picked up this hitchhiker once.

40:50.117 --> 40:54.121
Was years ago.
Ten, 15, something like that.

40:55.539 --> 41:02.087
Anyway, she got drunk, you know?
And I wanted her to take Larry's cherry.

41:04.840 --> 41:05.841
So, yeah.

41:05.924 --> 41:08.302
When she was feeling no pain,

41:08.385 --> 41:12.097
I… fooled around with her a little bit,

41:12.181 --> 41:15.601
and then Larry took his turn.

41:17.644 --> 41:19.229
Yeah. So, we were sharing this tent

41:19.313 --> 41:21.732
because we had a reenactment nearby
the next day.

41:22.524 --> 41:25.777
Anyway, I was too fucked up
to leave the tent,

41:25.861 --> 41:29.448
so I just figured I'd pass out before
Larry really started getting into it.

41:33.285 --> 41:37.164
You know, sometimes a girl says "no"
but her body's saying "yes"?

41:37.247 --> 41:38.832
You know, man. You know how it is?

41:41.418 --> 41:46.006
But with Larry, when this girl said "no,"
she goddamn meant it.

41:48.217 --> 41:52.262
And I see him
over on his side of the tent with her,

41:53.847 --> 41:58.644
and he looks like some kind of wolf.

41:59.853 --> 42:03.023
You know, like he might actually
rip her throat out with his teeth.

42:06.568 --> 42:07.611
Instead, he…

42:09.738 --> 42:11.031
hit her a bunch of times.

42:11.865 --> 42:13.116
Choked her a bit.

42:13.825 --> 42:15.619
Like, spit on her.

42:18.747 --> 42:20.832
Called her a bunch of names until he came.

42:24.461 --> 42:26.421
What were you doing during all this?

42:27.756 --> 42:31.301
I was, like, in shock. You know?

42:33.178 --> 42:35.180
And she's lying there afterwards,

42:35.264 --> 42:37.391
and I see this look
Larry gets in his eyes.

42:37.891 --> 42:39.309
What kind of look?

42:39.393 --> 42:40.686
Kind you never wanna see.

42:45.190 --> 42:47.150
And I said, "Don't."

42:48.068 --> 42:49.152
Larry looked at me and--

42:49.236 --> 42:51.071
He knew what I was saying.
I knew what I was saying.

42:51.154 --> 42:54.116
That poor girl, she fucking knew.

43:04.668 --> 43:06.670
Eventually Larry passed out.

43:10.924 --> 43:12.217
I sat up the rest of the night,

43:12.301 --> 43:14.761
in case he woke up
with that idea still in his head.

43:20.017 --> 43:24.396
But he just kept sleeping, snoring away.

43:26.440 --> 43:29.902
Next morning,
the girl went out with some biker.

43:33.530 --> 43:35.616
You know, I always felt like I fucked up.

43:37.075 --> 43:41.205
I introduced him to, you know,
sex in the wrong way,

43:41.288 --> 43:43.123
with the wrong woman. So, I…

43:43.207 --> 43:45.792
So maybe that's why
he got a taste for killing them?

43:48.337 --> 43:50.881
That one thing
didn't make your brother a killer.

43:50.964 --> 43:53.634
-I never said he was a killer.
-But you knew.

43:53.717 --> 43:54.927
I don't. I didn't.

43:55.010 --> 43:56.094
You've always known.

44:09.733 --> 44:10.734
Gary.

44:13.946 --> 44:14.947
Gary.

44:20.202 --> 44:21.578
If your brother gets out,

44:22.079 --> 44:23.830
and he moves back in here,

44:24.873 --> 44:26.542
and he gets his old job back,

44:27.042 --> 44:29.002
and life goes back to the way it was…

44:32.089 --> 44:37.052
are you gonna be able to stay up
every night for the rest of your life

44:37.135 --> 44:39.805
to make sure your brother stays
where you can see him?

45:20.053 --> 45:22.097
Hey, Jimmy. Come on.

45:22.181 --> 45:23.265
Come on. Need help here.

45:24.516 --> 45:25.976
Come on. There you go.

45:28.145 --> 45:30.355
-They were supposed to tell me, Jimmy.
-What?

45:30.439 --> 45:33.442
While I was on vacation. If you asked
for me, they were supposed to tell me.

45:33.525 --> 45:34.526
I need a pen.

45:34.610 --> 45:37.738
Okay. Listen, Dr. Hackett's actions
will be subject to review--

45:37.821 --> 45:39.781
-That doesn't matter. I need a pen!
-Okay.

45:39.865 --> 45:42.576
-Jimmy, we're gonna make this right.
-I need a pen.

45:45.954 --> 45:47.039
I'll get some paper.

46:53.856 --> 46:55.107
What are the dots?

46:56.900 --> 46:57.985
The bodies.

47:00.112 --> 47:01.113
Okay?

47:02.906 --> 47:04.992
They're the bodies. There were 21.

47:05.075 --> 47:06.743
-He had a map.
-Hall had a map?

47:06.827 --> 47:09.830
Of all his dead. I saw it.
This is it, but this is shit.

47:09.913 --> 47:11.123
Okay.

47:11.707 --> 47:12.708
Jimmy.

47:16.461 --> 47:17.963
We'll work this map, Jimmy.

47:19.131 --> 47:20.757
We'll see what we can do.

47:21.341 --> 47:22.342
It'll help.

47:31.226 --> 47:32.477
He used two belts.

47:38.942 --> 47:39.943
What?

47:45.866 --> 47:49.286
On Jessica Roach. He used two belts
buckled together to strangle her.

47:55.584 --> 47:56.752
He told you that?

48:00.172 --> 48:01.256
In detail.

48:06.678 --> 48:07.846
What else he tell you?

48:14.019 --> 48:17.648
Told me he folded Tricia Reitler's clothes
and placed her earring on top.

48:25.614 --> 48:26.990
Then we got him, Jimmy.

48:29.034 --> 48:30.160
You got him.

49:04.486 --> 49:07.948
Mr. Keene, when last you stood
before this court,

49:08.031 --> 49:10.117
you carried an air of entitlement.

49:11.159 --> 49:12.160
You actually wore it

49:12.244 --> 49:15.539
like someone would wear
their clothes or their skin.

49:17.040 --> 49:18.250
Where'd it go, son?

49:19.960 --> 49:21.211
I don't know, Your Honor.

49:23.714 --> 49:26.800
Well, judging by the brief
presented to me by Mr. Beaumont,

49:26.884 --> 49:28.594
I would venture that you left it behind

49:28.677 --> 49:31.889
in that hell that you entered
on behalf of this case.

49:36.268 --> 49:38.312
Mr. Keene, the court hereby
commutes your sentence

49:38.395 --> 49:40.898
of 120 months for narcotics trafficking.

49:40.981 --> 49:43.275
This commutation is
full without conditions,

49:43.358 --> 49:44.902
and effective immediately.

49:47.779 --> 49:49.281
You're a free man, Mr. Keene.

50:01.710 --> 50:02.711
Thank you.

50:14.848 --> 50:16.517
I didn't get the bodies for you.

50:18.894 --> 50:20.062
You did plenty.

50:24.233 --> 50:26.360
Hey, Jimmy. I'd like you to meet somebody.

50:27.945 --> 50:29.154
Brian Miller, Jim.

50:32.115 --> 50:33.575
You got the first confession.

50:34.785 --> 50:35.869
You found…

50:37.037 --> 50:40.541
Jessica Roach. Yes, I did.

50:41.458 --> 50:42.793
-Jessica.
-Yeah.

50:43.377 --> 50:44.378
Yeah.

50:45.546 --> 50:47.714
I just wanted to thank you
for what you did.

50:52.219 --> 50:54.429
Never found out where they're buried.

50:55.430 --> 50:57.391
You made sure he won't bury any more.

51:08.819 --> 51:11.989
The petitioner's claim
that the confessions were coerced,

51:12.072 --> 51:14.074
and further, that the petitioner himself

51:14.157 --> 51:17.286
had not the mental capacity
to understand the charges,

51:17.369 --> 51:19.371
does not bear up to scrutiny.

51:20.956 --> 51:22.541
Further, the respondent,

51:22.624 --> 51:25.836
working within the boundaries
of the existing cases and evidence,

51:25.919 --> 51:29.381
has produced further sourcing
which confirms the petitioner knew

51:29.464 --> 51:31.884
details of the crimes
to which he confessed

51:31.967 --> 51:35.596
that only the actual perpetrator
could know.

51:36.722 --> 51:39.016
It is the decision of this court

51:39.099 --> 51:41.310
that the ruling
of the criminal court stand.

51:41.894 --> 51:44.313
The petitioner's appeal is hereby denied.

51:44.813 --> 51:46.815
Bailiffs, please remove the prisoner

51:46.899 --> 51:49.943
and return him immediately
to where he belongs.

51:50.485 --> 51:51.820
Court is adjourned.

52:33.487 --> 52:34.738
-You see him?
-I see him.

52:51.046 --> 52:52.047
Hey.

53:13.527 --> 53:14.528
Thank you.

54:09.875 --> 54:10.876
You okay?

54:13.629 --> 54:14.838
I can't sleep.

54:16.924 --> 54:19.176
When I do sleep, it's like I didn't.

54:19.259 --> 54:22.095
It's the apnea, Larry.
They're supposed to be treating that.

54:25.349 --> 54:26.642
What are you gonna do?

54:27.309 --> 54:31.188
You're gonna tell 'em to treat it, Larry.
It was a contributory factor, they said.

54:32.689 --> 54:33.774
Contri--

54:36.735 --> 54:38.362
To your suicide try.

54:39.238 --> 54:41.615
What? Wasn't why I did it.

54:42.950 --> 54:44.243
Then why?

54:50.249 --> 54:53.085
-I don't belong in here.
-Yes, you do.

54:53.168 --> 54:55.045
I don't deserve this injus--

54:56.964 --> 54:59.383
"Yes, you do?" What?

54:59.967 --> 55:00.968
You do.

55:01.468 --> 55:04.972
It's all mucked up in your head, man.
It's eating you away.

55:06.807 --> 55:07.850
What?

55:09.351 --> 55:11.562
-The girls, Larry.
-No.

55:11.645 --> 55:13.105
-The girls. Yes.
-No.

55:13.188 --> 55:16.316
You gotta tell people what you did.
You gotta get clear of it.

55:20.070 --> 55:23.824
You're my brother.

55:25.117 --> 55:29.246
And I failed you.
I didn't look after you right.

55:31.039 --> 55:35.335
Look, if you get the flu,
I'm supposed to get you medicine.

55:35.878 --> 55:39.464
If you're cold, and I have a blanket,
I'm supposed to share it with you.

55:40.048 --> 55:41.675
If you're fucked up in how you think,

55:41.758 --> 55:43.677
I'm supposed to help you
not do bad things.

55:43.760 --> 55:45.929
No.

55:46.471 --> 55:49.433
No, Gary. Not you.

55:52.102 --> 55:53.103
I--

55:57.649 --> 55:58.650
Look, I--

56:01.528 --> 56:03.488
I need to do what's right here, Larry.

56:07.618 --> 56:08.911
And not for them.

56:09.453 --> 56:11.914
Not for them, but for you.

56:14.458 --> 56:16.543
You're never gonna stop living in fucking…

56:17.669 --> 56:19.630
agony till you do.

56:20.839 --> 56:21.840
Gary.

56:25.802 --> 56:27.304
Not you, Gary.

56:27.387 --> 56:31.391
Please. Hey. Please?

56:33.227 --> 56:34.520
Gotta let me help you.

56:42.569 --> 56:45.739
Ladies and gentlemen,
our flying time today to Grand Rapids

56:45.822 --> 56:48.492
will be approximately 55 minutes.

56:48.575 --> 56:50.661
The captain has turned off
the seat belt sign,

56:50.744 --> 56:52.871
so relax and enjoy the flight.

57:03.048 --> 57:04.508
Can I get you anything, sir?

57:05.884 --> 57:07.261
Vodka soda, please.

57:31.076 --> 57:32.077
Lemon or lime?

57:33.120 --> 57:34.121
Lemon.

57:36.832 --> 57:37.916
Most people choose lime.

57:41.587 --> 57:42.963
I'm a rebel.

57:44.131 --> 57:45.257
A bad boy.

57:46.842 --> 57:48.302
Well, I'm trying to reform.

57:50.179 --> 57:51.346
No, you're not.

57:53.640 --> 57:54.850
What's your name?

57:54.933 --> 57:56.435
Tori. With an "I."

57:58.187 --> 58:00.898
Jimmy. With a "Y."

58:02.691 --> 58:03.984
Nice to meet you, Jimmy.

58:04.860 --> 58:06.612
Nice to meet you, Tori with an "I".
