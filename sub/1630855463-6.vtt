to touch anything in this house.

00:10.553 --> 00:11.470
Those were her things.

00:11.554 --> 00:12.555
Your mother could
have warned you

00:12.638 --> 00:13.806
that this was gonna happen.

a suit and tie.

[Steven] Yeah, well,
Milo's not your perfect guy.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.150
I saw you and Jeremy.

00:24.233 --> 00:25.401
There's something there.

Doesn't matter
how far apart you sit.

Jere, I don't want you to hate
us, but I think about her

all the time.

00:30.322 --> 00:31.449
[Julia] The buyers made an offer

You-you sold this house

00:52.803 --> 00:55.306
Yes. To a-a lovely family
with three children

00:55.389 --> 00:57.725

Well, it can't just be over.

You just refused to believe it.

for you here.

01:42.561 --> 01:43.979
That hasn't changed.

You hate the water.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.627
I want you to know them.

Do you? Because it kind of feels
like you've kept me away

02:10.130 --> 02:12.466

all the bad stuff.

But, I don't know, I mean,

our last tie to them.

I mean, they didn't
want us around.

02:20.266 --> 02:21.600
Yeah, but that-that's the thing.

02:21.684 --> 02:23.185
I talked to Conrad

02:25.353 --> 02:26.856
I can't go back to the buyers

that you're gonna get closure

02:40.995 --> 02:43.706
by selling this house,
but you're not.

You never will.

02:46.792 --> 02:48.293
What makes you so sure?

Because you're not
selling it for closure

02:50.379 --> 02:52.298
or for money
or any of the other reasons.

02:52.381 --> 02:54.133
You're selling it
for confirmation.

02:54.216 --> 02:57.845
That you could...
that we could never belong here.

be Shitmas all over again.
