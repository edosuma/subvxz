WEBVTT

00:04.455 --> 00:07.524
You know at the movies they show
that ad for the concessions?

00:07.592 --> 00:10.889
Where the cartoon candy's dancing
and the Milk Dud's playing the banjo?

00:10.962 --> 00:12.757
- Oh, he's wailing on that banjo.
- Yeah.

00:12.830 --> 00:15.057
I just don't understand
the Raisinets.

00:15.132 --> 00:16.961
- The sax player? Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:17.301 --> 00:19.869
The box of Raisinets runs
up to the concession stand...

00:19.937 --> 00:22.232
buys another box of Raisinets.

00:23.207 --> 00:24.774
- So?
- Box of Raisinets eating...

00:24.842 --> 00:27.137
another box of Raisinets?

00:27.211 --> 00:28.539
It's perverse.

00:28.880 --> 00:30.470
He's not gonna eat them.

00:30.548 --> 00:33.344
He's buying them
for his Pepsi girlfriend.

00:33.417 --> 00:36.486
And why is he dating a Pepsi?
They're not having children.

00:36.554 --> 00:38.281
They're musicians.

00:38.356 --> 00:40.048
Musicians.

00:40.124 --> 00:42.522
Get a real job.

00:48.499 --> 00:52.126
- What do you want?
- I've had everything on the menu.

00:52.203 --> 00:54.066
Surprise me.

00:54.572 --> 00:57.664
Neil, Neil.

00:57.742 --> 01:01.505
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm supposed to
meet my boyfriend here.

01:01.579 --> 01:03.271
He looks just like you.

01:05.983 --> 01:08.074
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:08.152 --> 01:10.243
- Like me?
- Yeah, sorry.

01:12.356 --> 01:14.048
Like me?

01:14.392 --> 01:15.857
But how?

01:15.927 --> 01:18.359
Here's your halibut omelet.

01:18.429 --> 01:22.590
- Surprised?
- Yes. Yes, I am.

01:24.769 --> 01:26.860
Look what I got for you
for your Florida trip.

01:27.204 --> 01:30.102
Crazy Shirts was closing them out.
I got a dozen for a buck.

01:31.475 --> 01:33.634
I saved a fortune. Look at that.

01:33.711 --> 01:35.039
There you go.

01:36.280 --> 01:37.779
- "Number-one dad."
- Yeah.

01:37.848 --> 01:40.610
And it's a medium. Perfect.

01:41.686 --> 01:43.879
- Hey. Hey. You ready?
- Almost.

01:43.955 --> 01:46.319
Look, when you're
in Florida, can my cigar guy...

01:46.390 --> 01:48.617
drop off some Cubans
for me at your parents'?

01:48.693 --> 01:50.920
I'm helping my parents
move into their new condo.

01:50.995 --> 01:54.758
- I'm gonna be busy.
- Oh, come on, man, help a brother out.

01:55.399 --> 01:58.297
- All right.
- Yeah. I owe you one.

01:58.369 --> 01:59.936
We're even.

02:01.138 --> 02:02.967
Hey, Jerry, figure this out.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.630
I'm in the coffee shop...

02:04.709 --> 02:07.710
and this beautiful girl
I could never even talk to...

02:07.778 --> 02:09.937
mistakes me for her boyfriend.

02:10.014 --> 02:12.412
That's a nice four seconds.

02:12.483 --> 02:16.485
I look just like him. I, me, this.

02:16.554 --> 02:19.316
This is what her boyfriend looks like.
How is that possible?

02:19.390 --> 02:21.617
- Maybe he has money.
- Maybe he doesn't.

02:21.692 --> 02:23.555
Maybe he and I are
exactly the same...

02:23.627 --> 02:26.457
except for one minor
yet crucial detail.

02:26.797 --> 02:29.991
- You never know.
- Sometimes you do.

02:30.801 --> 02:33.927
Maybe it's some...
Some small thing I could change.

02:34.005 --> 02:36.505
Like a mustache
or wearing a top hat...

02:36.574 --> 02:39.142
or a monocle or a cane.

02:39.210 --> 02:40.777
Who's she dating? Mr. Peanut?

02:45.116 --> 02:48.708
You could do a lot worse than
Mr. Peanut, my friend.

02:50.454 --> 02:51.919
So, what do you want to see?

02:51.989 --> 02:53.351
How about Sack Lunch?

02:54.625 --> 02:57.387
How about The English Patient?
It's up for all those Oscars.

02:57.461 --> 03:00.223
Come on, Blaine, I mean,
look at the poster for Sack Lunch.

03:00.531 --> 03:03.191
It's a family in a brown paper bag.

03:03.701 --> 03:05.735
Don't you wanna know
how they got in there?

03:05.803 --> 03:07.165
No.

03:09.440 --> 03:13.135
- Oh, sold out.
- Oh, two for The English Patient.

03:13.411 --> 03:17.709
So do you think they got shrunk down,
or is it just a giant sack?

03:21.685 --> 03:23.776
Hi, remember me?

03:23.854 --> 03:25.888
I'm the guy that looks like Neil.

03:25.956 --> 03:28.047
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:29.126 --> 03:30.887
Is Neil here?

03:30.961 --> 03:32.653
Oh, no, he got held up at work.

03:32.730 --> 03:34.764
Oh, that's too bad.
I wanted to meet him...

03:34.832 --> 03:36.365
seeing as we look so similar.

03:36.867 --> 03:39.663
Well, you know, you don't look
that much like him.

03:42.473 --> 03:44.905
- Of course not.
- No, you're a little taller.

03:48.913 --> 03:52.449
You look like you're in better shape
than Neil. Do you work out?

03:53.751 --> 03:56.752
Listen, I... I don't mean
to seem forward...

03:56.821 --> 03:59.822
but is there any way
that I could possibly...

03:59.890 --> 04:02.322
have Neil's phone number?

04:03.994 --> 04:06.085
What is everyone talking about:

04:06.163 --> 04:09.061
"The English Patient,
it's so romantic"?

04:09.133 --> 04:11.963
God, that movie stunk.

04:12.036 --> 04:13.433
I kind of liked it.

04:13.504 --> 04:15.196
No, you didn't.

04:15.272 --> 04:19.035
Elaine, Blaine, did you just see
The English Patient?

04:19.110 --> 04:20.767
Didn't you love it?

04:20.845 --> 04:23.778
- No.
- How could you not love that movie?

04:23.848 --> 04:27.111
How about, it sucked.

04:28.052 --> 04:33.317
That Ralph Fiennes. I would give up
my firstborn for him.

04:33.991 --> 04:36.924
He's getting the short end
of that stick.

04:39.530 --> 04:43.088
Jerry, this is Del Boca Vista's
new physical fitness room.

04:43.167 --> 04:45.132
They got medicine balls.
You can bike ride.

04:45.202 --> 04:46.963
- Anything you want.
- StairMaster?

04:47.037 --> 04:48.798
- What?
- Nothing.

04:49.140 --> 04:51.970
- See what I'm wearing?
- Oh, did you get that out of my bag?

04:52.042 --> 04:54.110
No, your mother found it.

04:54.178 --> 04:56.610
Son, this is the most wonderful...

04:56.680 --> 04:59.112
and thoughtful thing
you've ever done for me.

04:59.183 --> 05:02.275
You know, I bought you
a Cadillac. Twice.

05:04.922 --> 05:06.284
Oh, here he is.

05:06.357 --> 05:08.152
This is the man I wanted you to see.

05:08.225 --> 05:12.557
Izzy Mandelbaum.
He's 80 years old but strong as an ox.

05:12.630 --> 05:14.391
Watch this.

05:16.433 --> 05:18.194
See that? You couldn't do that.

05:18.269 --> 05:20.837
I could. I choose not to.

05:21.739 --> 05:24.137
Hey, Morty, who's this?

05:24.208 --> 05:26.401
This is my son, Jerry,
from New York.

05:26.477 --> 05:29.671
- He thinks he can lift more than Izzy.
- I didn't say that.

05:29.747 --> 05:33.908
Hey, Izzy, this kid says he can
lift more than you can.

05:35.052 --> 05:38.053
Hey, your kid's pretty funny, Morty.
He should be a comedian.

05:38.122 --> 05:41.214
- Actually, I am a comedian.
- That's not so funny.

05:42.693 --> 05:44.385
Think you're better than me, huh?

05:44.461 --> 05:47.792
Izzy used to work out
with Charles Atlas in the '50s.

05:47.865 --> 05:49.660
1850s?

05:49.733 --> 05:53.826
Well, that's it. It's go time.
Let's see you lift that.

05:53.904 --> 05:55.471
- Mr. Mandelbaum...
- Come on.

05:55.539 --> 05:58.199
- Pump it.
- All right.

05:58.275 --> 06:02.436
Wrong attitude. You're not bringing
that trash into my house.

06:03.480 --> 06:05.207
There. All right?

06:05.282 --> 06:07.543
Step aside, string bean.

06:07.618 --> 06:09.447
I'll show you.

06:09.520 --> 06:12.088
I'm gonna take it up a notch.

06:15.259 --> 06:17.054
My back.

06:22.166 --> 06:24.325
Somebody call an ambulance.

06:24.401 --> 06:27.026
There's already an ambulance here
for Mrs. Glickman.

06:27.104 --> 06:29.434
There's room for one more.

06:31.742 --> 06:34.367
Hey, one for Sack Lunch.
It's good, right?

06:34.445 --> 06:36.775
Yeah, good.

06:37.815 --> 06:39.439
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

06:39.516 --> 06:41.516
We just saw
The English Patient again.

06:41.585 --> 06:43.550
It's even better the second time.

06:43.621 --> 06:45.245
They make it longer?

06:45.322 --> 06:47.014
Forgot my umbrella.

06:47.091 --> 06:49.091
- Blaine.
- Elaine.

06:49.159 --> 06:50.920
You said you were busy tonight.

06:51.862 --> 06:53.293
To tell you the truth, Elaine.

06:53.364 --> 06:56.797
I don't know if I can be with someone
who doesn't like The English Patient.

06:56.867 --> 06:59.060
It's just a stupid movie.

06:59.603 --> 07:02.695
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Come on, Blaine.

07:02.773 --> 07:04.238
Let's go.

07:04.308 --> 07:06.569
Enjoy Sack Lunch.

07:07.144 --> 07:08.609
I will.

07:09.980 --> 07:11.945
How could you do that
to Mr. Mandelbaum?

07:12.016 --> 07:14.744
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- He egged me on.

07:14.818 --> 07:17.751
- You should be more mature.
- He's 80.

07:17.821 --> 07:22.585
Okay. Tomorrow Jerry and I
will visit Izzy and apologize.

07:22.660 --> 07:25.092
- Now, good night.
- You're not sleeping in that shirt.

07:25.162 --> 07:26.456
It's too tight.

07:26.530 --> 07:29.656
- This shirt will never leave my body.
- Good night.

07:30.100 --> 07:33.692
All right, 7:30,
got the place to myself.

07:36.940 --> 07:39.338
- Jerry Seinfeld, please.
- You must be Kramer's guys.

07:39.410 --> 07:42.274
- Come on in. You got the cigars?
- What cigars?

07:42.346 --> 07:44.107
Kramer said to bring him
some Cubans.

07:44.181 --> 07:46.272
We are the Cubans.

07:54.692 --> 07:56.282
Yeah, hello, Jerry's place.

07:56.360 --> 07:58.018
They're real Cubans?

07:58.095 --> 08:00.993
They're human beings from Cuba?

08:01.065 --> 08:03.827
I said Cubans.
What did you think I meant?

08:03.901 --> 08:05.866
Cigars.

08:06.870 --> 08:10.565
Jerry, Cuban cigars
are illegal in this country.

08:10.641 --> 08:14.336
- That's why I got these guys.
- You're making your own cigars now?

08:14.411 --> 08:16.206
Yeah, I got investors all lined up.

08:16.280 --> 08:18.871
Hold on a second. Hi, Dad.

08:18.949 --> 08:20.983
- Who are they?
- They're Cuban cigar rollers.

08:21.051 --> 08:22.778
Don't tell your mother.

08:23.487 --> 08:26.351
What is that bubbling sound?
Are you making your tomato sauce?

08:26.623 --> 08:29.658
- Yeah, hot and spicy.
- You're not wearing a shirt, are you?

08:30.361 --> 08:32.292
Yes, I am.

08:32.629 --> 08:34.629
What color is it?

08:36.100 --> 08:37.861
Damn it.

08:40.871 --> 08:44.134
You know, you could have just
given me Neil's number.

08:44.207 --> 08:46.139
You didn't have to
take me out to dinner.

08:46.210 --> 08:48.870
I wanted to give it to you in person.

08:48.946 --> 08:52.345
I don't have to be up in the morning
and I know a great breakfast place...

08:52.416 --> 08:54.074
right around the corner.

08:55.886 --> 08:58.386
Does Neil like to
eat a big breakfast?

08:58.455 --> 09:00.716
Why don't you come in?
We'll talk about it.

09:00.791 --> 09:02.119
I really should get going.

09:02.192 --> 09:04.556
I wanna be home in case Neil calls.

09:06.530 --> 09:09.929
Well, good night.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.795
I'll see you.

09:14.405 --> 09:16.097
Rough night?

09:16.173 --> 09:17.900
You wouldn't believe it.

09:17.975 --> 09:19.872
My boyfriend dumped me.

09:19.943 --> 09:21.635
My friends, who I don't even like...

09:21.712 --> 09:24.144
they won't talk to me,
all because I don't like...

09:24.214 --> 09:26.441
that stupid English Patient movie.

09:26.517 --> 09:28.915
Really? I thought it was pretty good.

09:28.986 --> 09:30.485
Oh, come on.

09:30.554 --> 09:32.451
Good? What was good about it?

09:32.956 --> 09:36.287
Those sex scenes. I mean, please.

09:36.360 --> 09:39.395
Give me something I can use.

09:40.664 --> 09:42.789
Well, I liked it.

09:44.234 --> 09:46.962
You forgot about my piece of pie.

09:47.037 --> 09:48.661
Hello?

09:49.173 --> 09:52.936
You know, sex in a tub.
That doesn't work.

10:00.951 --> 10:02.609
This is quite a condo.

10:02.686 --> 10:04.879
The Mandelbaums own
the Magic Pan restaurants.

10:04.955 --> 10:08.115
- The crepe place?
- Yeah, this is all big crepe money.

10:08.192 --> 10:09.589
There's crepe money?

10:10.394 --> 10:11.756
What are you doing here?

10:11.829 --> 10:13.590
Mr. Mandelbaum,
I wanted to come by...

10:13.664 --> 10:15.755
tell you how sorry I was
you hurt yourself.

10:15.833 --> 10:17.730
What the hell is that?

10:17.801 --> 10:19.960
- What?
- That shirt.

10:20.037 --> 10:22.401
You think that you
are the number-one dad?

10:22.473 --> 10:24.564
This was a gift from my son.

10:24.641 --> 10:27.869
Oh, I see how it works now.

10:27.945 --> 10:30.445
He knocks me out of commission...

10:30.514 --> 10:34.914
so you can strut around
in your fancy number-one shirt.

10:35.152 --> 10:38.688
Well, I'll show you
who's number one.

10:38.755 --> 10:42.586
- Mr. Mandelbaum, please.
- It's go time.

10:45.496 --> 10:47.587
My back... I can't move.

10:48.098 --> 10:52.134
- Call an ambulance.
- Think I saw one a couple doors down.

10:57.074 --> 10:58.539
So she wanted you to come up...

10:58.609 --> 11:03.043
but you left because you thought
some guy might be calling you?

11:03.113 --> 11:04.510
Some guy, some guy?

11:04.581 --> 11:06.273
Neil.

11:06.617 --> 11:09.982
I have got to find out
how he could get a girl like Danielle.

11:10.053 --> 11:13.054
George, you've got Danielle.
Forget about Neil.

11:13.123 --> 11:14.952
You've "out-Neiled" him.

11:16.126 --> 11:18.956
So I'm Neil. How did I do that?

11:19.029 --> 11:20.858
I don't know,
but you better keep it up.

11:21.598 --> 11:23.393
I'm gonna go meet Danielle.

11:23.467 --> 11:26.092
There's a new Neil in town.

11:29.039 --> 11:33.599
I try take a vacation. I come back,
the whole operation's in shambles.

11:33.677 --> 11:36.541
- Hello.
- Hey, Jerry. Number one here.

11:36.613 --> 11:38.647
Did you go see Izzy
at the back specialist?

11:38.715 --> 11:42.148
- I will. I just walked in the door.
- You have to go see him.

11:42.219 --> 11:44.583
- Ma.
- Helen, will you stop bothering him?

11:44.655 --> 11:46.518
Jerry, that shirt has gone
to his head.

11:46.590 --> 11:49.352
Number one, signing off.

11:50.694 --> 11:54.161
Jerry, I just picked up the Cubans
at the bus station.

11:54.731 --> 11:56.822
What's going on?

11:56.900 --> 11:58.729
- What?
- They're not real Cubans.

11:58.802 --> 12:01.769
- They're Dominicans.
- So?

12:01.838 --> 12:05.339
So, Jerry, if my investors
don't get Cubans, the whole deal's off.

12:05.409 --> 12:08.706
- What's the difference?
- Jerry, once you've had real Cubans...

12:08.779 --> 12:11.006
there's just nothing else like it.

12:11.081 --> 12:12.842
We're talking about people, right?

12:12.916 --> 12:17.282
Yes, yes, the quality, the texture,
the intoxicating aroma.

12:17.354 --> 12:18.921
These guys don't have it.

12:19.890 --> 12:21.548
I thought they smelled pretty nice.

12:21.625 --> 12:24.421
- Jerry, your palate's unrefined.
- Is not.

12:24.494 --> 12:26.061
- Is too. Is too.
- Is not.

12:26.129 --> 12:27.992
- I'm not having this conversation.
- Are too.

12:28.065 --> 12:30.463
- Are too. Are too.
- Am not. Am not.

12:30.534 --> 12:32.864
Another productive meeting.

12:33.203 --> 12:36.966
By the way, I saw that
English Patient film last night.

12:37.040 --> 12:41.975
- It was extraordinary.
- Oh, yes, it was so romantic.

12:42.045 --> 12:45.046
- It ravished me.
- Elaine, what did you think?

12:47.017 --> 12:50.052
Well, actually I haven't seen it...

12:50.120 --> 12:53.883
so I couldn't tell you
whether I liked it...

12:53.957 --> 12:57.151
or whether it really sucked.

12:58.028 --> 13:00.494
- You haven't seen it?
- No.

13:00.564 --> 13:03.394
That's it. Drop everything.
We're going right now.

13:07.304 --> 13:10.567
Again, Mr. Mandelbaum, this back
specialist is supposed to be the best.

13:10.641 --> 13:14.438
If there's anything else I can do, don't
hesitate to try and find my number.

13:14.511 --> 13:16.078
Oh, wait.

13:17.447 --> 13:19.674
How about that, huh?

13:20.083 --> 13:23.550
The "World's Greatest Dad."

13:23.620 --> 13:25.278
My son made it for me.

13:25.355 --> 13:27.821
- That's very nice.
- The best in the world...

13:27.891 --> 13:30.289
which means I'm better
than just number one.

13:31.128 --> 13:34.163
Well, I don't know how official
any of these rankings really are.

13:35.432 --> 13:39.263
- Hi, Son.
- Hi, Daddy.

13:39.336 --> 13:40.926
This is your son?

13:41.004 --> 13:43.129
I got married in high school.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.102
Hey, who are you?

13:45.175 --> 13:47.175
This is Seinfeld's kid.

13:47.244 --> 13:50.472
Oh, you think you're tough,
picking on an old man?

13:50.981 --> 13:54.642
Maybe you'd like to try taking on
somebody your own age.

13:54.718 --> 13:56.877
You got any kids?

13:58.789 --> 14:00.880
Oh, you think you're
better than me?

14:00.957 --> 14:03.184
Go ahead, pick out anything
in the room here.

14:03.260 --> 14:05.385
I'll lift it up over my head.

14:05.462 --> 14:07.894
Look, no one is lifting anything.

14:07.964 --> 14:10.157
The television.

14:11.935 --> 14:15.801
This one's for you, Pop. It's go time.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.807
Oh, my back.

14:18.875 --> 14:22.536
- Call an ambulance.
- We're already in a hospital.

14:24.548 --> 14:27.310
All right, partner.
Let's get down to business.

14:27.384 --> 14:29.384
Okay. Well, I'll...
I'll get the Cubans.

14:29.453 --> 14:30.815
They're right out here.

14:35.092 --> 14:38.821
Yeah, here they are.
They're Cubans, real Cubans.

14:41.064 --> 14:43.428
You wouldn't be trying to sell
old Earl Haffler...

14:43.500 --> 14:46.160
Dominicans in a Cuban wrapper,
now, would you?

14:46.236 --> 14:48.270
Oh, come on, look at these boys.

14:48.338 --> 14:52.272
If they were any more Cuban, Castro
would have smoked them himself.

14:52.809 --> 14:56.743
- We're talking about people, right?
- I think so.

14:57.481 --> 14:59.674
I thought he quit smoking cigars.

14:59.750 --> 15:04.344
Well, yeah, yeah, but they also rolled
for his brother, Dennis.

15:05.288 --> 15:08.721
- Dennis Castro?
- Dwayne.

15:10.227 --> 15:13.160
- Get the hell out of my office.
- What?

15:17.334 --> 15:20.369
- You know, Neil called me today.
- Really?

15:20.437 --> 15:23.370
Yeah, he's pretty upset I broke up
with him to go out with you.

15:23.440 --> 15:26.634
Well, I guess I showed
Neil who's Neil.

15:26.710 --> 15:29.040
He wanted to get together
tomorrow and have coffee.

15:29.112 --> 15:30.770
Coffee?

15:30.847 --> 15:33.575
I can beat that. Move in with me.

15:33.917 --> 15:36.713
- What?
- It beats the hell out of coffee.

15:40.657 --> 15:44.386
And I thought I knew what love was.

15:52.469 --> 15:56.699
- You asked her to move in with you?
- I gotta stay one step ahead of Neil.

15:57.674 --> 15:59.571
What if it's Neil Armstrong?

16:01.511 --> 16:03.875
Then I'm going to Mars.

16:05.248 --> 16:08.977
- What if it's Neil Diamond?
- Oh, shut up, Jerry, just shut up.

16:09.052 --> 16:11.086
All right, I gotta go back
to the hospital.

16:11.154 --> 16:14.189
- What? To see the old guy?
- No, I got into a thing with the son...

16:14.257 --> 16:15.619
and now he's laid up too.

16:16.226 --> 16:19.420
- How old's the son?
- I think he's the same age as the father.

16:19.863 --> 16:21.191
What is with this family?

16:21.264 --> 16:23.195
Don't know.
It's like, one of them dies...

16:23.266 --> 16:25.527
the other one wants to
bench-press the casket.

16:28.638 --> 16:30.433
Hey, Jerry.

16:32.075 --> 16:33.767
You cold?

16:34.411 --> 16:37.344
- It's them, right?
- Something wrong your chin?

16:38.748 --> 16:40.440
- Where?
- No, no, no, don't look.

16:42.452 --> 16:45.453
Over there, the Dominicans.

16:46.056 --> 16:47.987
Aren't they supposed to be
rolling cigars?

16:48.058 --> 16:51.559
Well, it didn't quite work out and
now I've got nothing for them to do.

16:51.628 --> 16:54.026
- So?
- So I taught them all about Cuba...

16:54.097 --> 16:55.630
and they really took to it.

16:55.699 --> 16:59.030
You know, Marxism,
the workers' revolution, the clothing.

17:00.570 --> 17:02.695
Boy, they seem pretty angry
about something.

17:02.772 --> 17:05.465
Yeah, I'm a little worried.

17:05.541 --> 17:07.906
When there's no work
and the people get restless...

17:07.978 --> 17:10.069
who do you think they come after?

17:14.784 --> 17:18.148
I swear to you, I didn't know
the TV was bolted to the table.

17:19.089 --> 17:22.056
I bet you pulled that trick
on my daddy in Florida.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.988
He couldn't handle the weight.

17:24.060 --> 17:27.152
Oh, so now you think
you're better than me?

17:27.230 --> 17:29.264
You think you're better than him?

17:29.332 --> 17:33.926
Look, let me just state for the record,
I think you're both better than me.

17:34.004 --> 17:35.503
Okay.

17:36.106 --> 17:37.764
My boys.

17:37.841 --> 17:40.842
- My dad.
- My grandpa.

17:40.911 --> 17:43.002
Oh, come on.

17:44.080 --> 17:45.442
What happened to him?

17:45.515 --> 17:47.583
He was trying to lift the TV.

17:47.651 --> 17:50.879
- That TV?
- Oh, no.

17:51.721 --> 17:53.789
It's go time.

17:55.558 --> 17:59.150
Why didn't anybody tell me
it was bolted down?

17:59.229 --> 18:01.126
I still thought you could do it.

18:01.197 --> 18:02.525
Me too.

18:02.599 --> 18:06.260
Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum,
Mandelbaum.

18:06.336 --> 18:08.404
Fellas, fellas, fellas, look, I gotta go.

18:08.471 --> 18:10.129
Oh, yeah, that's right, go.

18:10.206 --> 18:11.864
Put us all in the hospital...

18:11.942 --> 18:17.742
and you ruined our business
with all your macho head games.

18:20.817 --> 18:23.283
- I didn't ruin your business.
- Yes, you did.

18:23.353 --> 18:26.854
There's nobody there now at
the Magic Pan to roll the crepes.

18:26.923 --> 18:30.220
- We gotta close it up.
- Don't you hire people to do that?

18:30.560 --> 18:34.790
Each crepe has to be hand-rolled
by a Mandelbaum.

18:34.864 --> 18:38.400
That's what puts the magic
in Magic Pan.

18:42.138 --> 18:44.729
So you just need some guys
that could roll them?

18:45.075 --> 18:46.665
Yeah.

18:48.011 --> 18:50.511
I think I can help you out.
I'll see you later.

18:50.580 --> 18:53.080
Hey, I can't see the TV.

18:55.518 --> 18:57.245
Here.

18:58.621 --> 19:02.088
You think you're better than us,
don't you?

19:05.428 --> 19:07.519
Elaine, I hope you're
watching the clothes...

19:07.597 --> 19:11.724
because I can't take my eyes
off the passion.

19:12.435 --> 19:14.526
No, I can't do this anymore.

19:14.604 --> 19:18.037
I can't. It's too long.

19:18.108 --> 19:20.073
Quit telling your stupid story...

19:20.143 --> 19:24.703
about the stupid desert
and just die already.

19:24.781 --> 19:26.746
Die!

19:28.818 --> 19:30.442
Elaine, you don't like the movie?

19:30.520 --> 19:32.281
I hate it!

19:32.355 --> 19:34.514
Oh, go to hell!

19:36.026 --> 19:39.095
Well, why didn't you say so
in the first place?

19:39.162 --> 19:42.595
- You're fired.
- Great. I'll wait for you outside.

19:45.235 --> 19:46.802
He was gonna fire you?

19:46.870 --> 19:49.097
Well, the only way
I could talk him out of it...

19:49.172 --> 19:51.900
was that I agreed to go
and visit the Tunisian desert.

19:52.242 --> 19:54.674
- Tunisia?
- That's where they filmed the movie.

19:54.744 --> 19:56.971
It's supposed to inspire me.

19:57.047 --> 19:59.980
- Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
- I have to live in a cave.

20:03.486 --> 20:06.384
These Dominicans really know
their way around a crepe, huh?

20:06.890 --> 20:10.084
Look at that. Looks like they're
rolling a Double Corona.

20:10.160 --> 20:13.354
Just a cigar made out of Bisquick,
huh, Guillermo?

20:14.631 --> 20:16.096
I'm very happy with George.

20:16.166 --> 20:17.665
I'm sorry, Neil.

20:17.734 --> 20:19.529
It's over.

20:19.602 --> 20:21.727
Come on, let's just eat our crepes.

20:25.308 --> 20:26.932
My face!

20:28.678 --> 20:30.006
Neil!

20:30.613 --> 20:32.374
Why are the crepes spraying?

20:33.416 --> 20:36.713
The Dominicans are rolling them
too tight.

20:36.786 --> 20:39.616
Well, that's why you gotta get
real Cubans.

20:46.629 --> 20:49.254
Danielle. Where's Neil?

20:49.833 --> 20:51.924
- Is this him?
- Yeah.

20:52.001 --> 20:54.092
That blueberry crepe
burned him pretty badly.

20:55.305 --> 20:56.702
Whose cane is this?

20:56.773 --> 20:58.465
It's Neil's.

20:59.008 --> 21:00.336
Cane.

21:00.410 --> 21:01.977
I knew it.

21:02.912 --> 21:06.277
So we meet at last.

21:06.349 --> 21:10.215
I admire your skills, Mr. Peanut.

21:11.221 --> 21:13.152
Well, Danielle, we should get going.

21:13.223 --> 21:14.722
I got a key made for you.

21:14.791 --> 21:17.155
- George, I can't move in with you.
- What?

21:17.227 --> 21:20.160
I'm sorry, but I'm taking Neil
to a clinic in England.

21:20.230 --> 21:22.958
No, no, you can't leave me.

21:23.032 --> 21:26.226
Marry me. I'll burn myself.
I'll burn my parents.

21:26.736 --> 21:28.360
Sorry, George.

21:32.041 --> 21:33.972
George.

21:38.148 --> 21:39.806
I win.

21:41.000 --> 21:47.074

22:03.473 --> 22:06.064
Ladies and gentlemen,
in just one moment...

22:06.142 --> 22:08.710
we'll be showing
our feature presentation.

22:08.778 --> 22:11.039
No, no, no.

22:11.114 --> 22:14.706
The comedy hit, Sack Lunch,
starring Dabney Coleman.

22:14.984 --> 22:18.019
All right. Oh, this is shaping up.

22:18.087 --> 22:20.621
- Excuse me, please.
- Oh, sure.

22:24.994 --> 22:26.322
Ladies and gentlemen...

22:26.396 --> 22:30.125
because we have been exploited by
your Magic Pan crepe restaurants...

22:30.200 --> 22:33.133
we are hijacking
this plane to Cuba.

22:33.469 --> 22:34.831
Everyone stay in your seats.

22:35.338 --> 22:37.235
And shut that movie off.

22:37.874 --> 22:39.908
Oh, nuts.
