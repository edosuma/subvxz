-Yes, he is. [laughs]

13:19.965 --> 13:22.968
-I'm dancing, too!
-Me, too. [chuckles]

13:23.052 --> 13:25.095
I'm watching them dance.

13:25.179 --> 13:28.015

13:30.226 --> 13:34.980
[baby troll shouting]

13:39.568 --> 13:40.569
What? It's gone.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.822
[baby troll gibbering]

13:42.905 --> 13:43.906
Where did it go?

13:43.989 --> 13:45.157
Where did what go?

13:45.241 --> 13:47.409
Uh, the dancing bug, it's gone.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.620
I don't want to dance now.

13:49.703 --> 13:52.039
-He's loose!
-[baby troll shouting]

13:54.333 --> 13:55.835
[Hallgrim] What is going on?

13:55.918 --> 14:00.047
Uh, it must be one of those earthquakes
that only furniture can feel.

14:00.589 --> 14:03.509
Oh, I've read about those.
They're very real.

14:05.761 --> 14:07.763
[baby troll gibbering]

14:08.514 --> 14:11.475

[thudding, clattering]

[all screaming]

14:25.114 --> 14:26.115
Oh!

14:26.198 --> 14:27.616
Ow!

14:29.493 --> 14:31.203
[shouting]

14:33.038 --> 14:34.123
[whimpering]

14:34.707 --> 14:35.541
Oh!

14:35.624 --> 14:38.002
[screaming continues]

14:44.967 --> 14:46.093
Hi, Frida.

14:46.176 --> 14:48.554
-[baby troll groaning]
-[mice squeaking]

14:48.637 --> 14:49.597
[Alfur] Hilda!

14:49.680 --> 14:50.931
Hilda!

14:51.015 --> 14:53.726
-Who said that?
-It's a ghost!

14:53.809 --> 14:56.020
She's doing this. She's a witch!

14:56.520 --> 14:57.479
I knew it.

14:58.105 --> 15:00.608
-[banging]
-Ah! There it is!

15:01.442 --> 15:03.444

-[gasps]

15:03.527 --> 15:04.361
[groans]

15:04.445 --> 15:06.030
[laughing, snorts]

15:06.113 --> 15:08.782
And I thought tonight would be boring.

15:09.700 --> 15:12.369
-Hilda, what are you doing?
-I-- I can explain.

15:12.453 --> 15:14.538
-It's... there!
-[baby troll gibbering]

Ow! Oh!

15:31.388 --> 15:33.682
[nittens meowing]

15:33.766 --> 15:34.600
Hilda?

15:34.683 --> 15:37.144
Uh... hi.

15:37.227 --> 15:39.229
[baby troll laughing]

15:41.106 --> 15:43.233
Hilda! Hilda, get back here!

15:43.317 --> 15:44.443
Come on!

15:46.111 --> 15:47.696
[gasps] Hilda!

15:47.780 --> 15:49.365
[woman] So, you're Hilda's mother.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.951
What did that monster of yours
do to my son?

15:52.034 --> 15:54.954
He's so fearful now
he won't even go near a bird.

15:55.037 --> 15:57.081
[people shouting]

15:57.164 --> 15:58.582
Why am I itching?

15:59.458 --> 16:02.294
Oh, I knew those nittens were a bad idea.

16:07.967 --> 16:08.968
[locker door opens]

16:41.458 --> 16:43.127
[all panting]

16:43.210 --> 16:44.044
Where'd he go?

16:47.548 --> 16:49.341
[panting, grunts]

16:49.425 --> 16:51.135
[Magnusson chuckling] Oh! Whoops!

16:51.218 --> 16:52.886
Hope you're not leaving yet.

16:52.970 --> 16:56.223
You wouldn't want to miss
the statue unveiling.

16:56.306 --> 16:59.184
Ah! Oh, no, of course not.

16:59.268 --> 17:02.646
We're just, uh,
racing to the girls' room.

17:03.480 --> 17:04.982
And also the boys' room.

17:05.065 --> 17:06.108
[laughing]

17:06.191 --> 17:07.192
Good, good.

17:07.276 --> 17:09.820
You know what they say
about sculpture. Ahem.

17:09.903 --> 17:14.241
"The chisel is the lightning that brings
life to the clay of the stone."

17:15.451 --> 17:18.495
You know what?
That would go well in my speech.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.122
I'd better go rehearse again!

17:20.205 --> 17:21.665
Oh! [laughing]

17:22.332 --> 17:23.751
Great. Break a leg!

17:24.418 --> 17:26.128
Oh, wait! No running in the--

17:26.211 --> 17:27.463
Hallgrim!

17:27.546 --> 17:30.758
-Don't forget about--
-The statue of dedication, I know!

17:30.841 --> 17:32.176
[laughs] Oh.

17:32.259 --> 17:34.553
[nittens meowing]

17:34.636 --> 17:36.555
Why am I itchy all of a sudden?

17:37.347 --> 17:39.349
[all panting]

17:41.310 --> 17:42.269
There!

17:44.396 --> 17:46.190
It's in the ventilation system.

17:46.273 --> 17:48.317
You'll have to crawl in after it.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.569
[grunting]

17:50.652 --> 17:51.862
[Frida clears throat]

17:52.654 --> 17:53.530
Allow me.

17:54.281 --> 17:56.450
A Sparrow Scout is always prepared.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.542
[exhales]

18:06.960 --> 18:08.712
[grunting]

18:11.298 --> 18:13.342
Vents are so much bigger in films.

18:15.385 --> 18:16.386
I've got an idea.

18:19.348 --> 18:20.808
[gasps, gulps]

18:21.350 --> 18:24.686
Hilda, I'm very fond of you,
but I'm afraid I must decline.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.981
-Then what do we do?
-[distant troll roaring]

18:32.820 --> 18:34.530
[roaring]

18:34.613 --> 18:35.948
[all scream]

18:37.783 --> 18:39.660
-[Hilda] Uh-oh.
-[Hallgrim] Hilda?

18:41.245 --> 18:42.996
We need to chat.

18:47.876 --> 18:50.587
-[Hallgrim groaning]
-[nittens meowing]

18:50.671 --> 18:53.465
Mum's quite good at finding nittens...
if you need help.

18:53.549 --> 18:54.758
No, thank you.

18:54.842 --> 18:58.137
I've been concerned
about Hilda's behavior for a while.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.806
But tonight, Hilda has proven

19:00.889 --> 19:04.143
that she simply cannot fit
the mold of a proper student.

19:04.726 --> 19:07.896
And she's dragging Frida and David
down with her.

19:07.980 --> 19:12.025
I recommend moving Hilda
to a small transitional class

19:12.109 --> 19:15.487
that can offer more... personal attention.

19:16.113 --> 19:17.197
I'm sorry, Mum.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.741
I guess I haven't adapted
as well as you thought.

19:19.825 --> 19:20.659
Nonsense.

19:21.368 --> 19:23.579
Hilda, you're staying right where you are.

19:23.662 --> 19:24.496
Huh?

19:24.580 --> 19:27.082
Ms. Hallgrim, I don't know
what got into Hilda tonight,

19:27.166 --> 19:30.794
but the fact that she dragged
her friends into it is an excellent sign.

19:30.878 --> 19:31.753
Did you hear that?

19:31.837 --> 19:36.967
Hilda, this kind of interruption is just
the sort of thing I'm talking about.

19:37.050 --> 19:38.844
-Please continue.
-[thumping]

19:38.927 --> 19:42.055
[Mum] Ms. Hallgrim,
Hilda needs her friends to grow.

19:42.139 --> 19:44.933
Ever since they met,
she's learned a lot from them.

19:45.017 --> 19:48.228
If you pull Hilda out of their class,
you'll be setting her back.

19:49.104 --> 19:53.317
Well, perhaps we can give Hilda
a little more time to--

19:55.152 --> 19:57.529
-[baby troll shouting]
-Hilda, get down! [shouts]

19:57.613 --> 20:00.532
[all shouting]

20:03.744 --> 20:05.329
What on Earth? Ow!

20:07.497 --> 20:09.791
[shouting]

20:09.875 --> 20:11.168
What's going on?

20:13.795 --> 20:16.006
[grunting] Got you!

20:16.089 --> 20:19.593
[gasps] Is that... a troll?

20:19.676 --> 20:22.179
Yep, but I'd be more worried
about that one.

20:23.305 --> 20:25.098
[thunder rumbles]

20:31.188 --> 20:32.022
[gasps]

20:32.105 --> 20:34.441
[baby troll whining]

20:34.524 --> 20:36.693
A troll in the city!

20:36.777 --> 20:38.946
-We've got to sound the alarm.
-No!

20:39.029 --> 20:40.530
We don't want a crisis.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.121
-This is a crisis!
-Don't.

20:48.205 --> 20:50.165
It'll cause a panic and fighting,

20:50.249 --> 20:52.876
and David will go to jail
for a hundred years.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.088
She doesn't want to cause trouble.

20:56.171 --> 20:57.839
[troll roaring]

20:57.923 --> 20:59.174
Hilda, get back!

21:04.388 --> 21:06.181

21:06.265 --> 21:07.432

21:16.275 --> 21:18.318
[Hilda grunting]

21:20.570 --> 21:21.780
Ah!

21:21.863 --> 21:24.866
[baby cooing, laughing]

21:32.666 --> 21:35.294
She just came for her baby. See?

21:38.338 --> 21:39.923
How did you know?

21:40.007 --> 21:43.093
I'm afraid that's
the sort of thing she excels at.

21:55.355 --> 21:57.858
So, Ms. Hallgrim's
letting you stay in our class?

21:57.941 --> 22:00.694
And she's not telling anyone
about the trolls?

22:00.777 --> 22:05.032
-How did you swing that?
-We've come to... an understanding.

22:05.115 --> 22:07.826
Your daughter really is a remarkable girl.

22:09.661 --> 22:10.829
[Magnusson shouting]

22:11.413 --> 22:15.167
I have terrible news! Horrible news!

22:15.250 --> 22:17.419
It's a catastrophe!

22:17.502 --> 22:19.546
Oh, my heart hurts.

22:20.213 --> 22:22.549
Oh, please, no!

22:22.632 --> 22:24.926
-Why?
-What happened?

22:25.010 --> 22:29.431
The statue dedication is canceled!

22:29.514 --> 22:31.558
-[Magnusson sobbing]
