WHERE DID YOU GO?

18:22.935 --> 18:24.853
OH, THERE YOU ARE.

18:24.937 --> 18:25.771
IF YOU WANTED A KISS,

18:25.854 --> 18:29.983
ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS ASK.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.527
- WHOA!

18:33.111 --> 18:35.280
I CAN'T BELIEVE

18:35.364 --> 18:36.865
SHE KISSED ME.

18:36.949 --> 18:40.452
- MAYBE LUPE'S
YOUR ARCH-NEMESIS.

18:40.536 --> 18:41.578

18:44.289 --> 18:46.834
IF LUPE WANTS
A SUPERHERO BOYFRIEND,

I'LL GIVE HER
A SUPERHERO BOYFRIEND...

18:49.461 --> 18:53.882
AND ALL THE DANGER
THAT COMES WITH IT.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.844

YOU INVITED ME TO A PICNIC.

18:56.927 --> 18:59.888
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL HERE.

18:59.972 --> 19:03.016
I'VE NEVER
SEEN THE POWER PLANT BEFORE.

19:03.100 --> 19:06.395

19:06.478 --> 19:08.814
OR IF I WANT THE TOXIC FUMES
TO ALTER MY DNA.

19:08.897 --> 19:11.275
BUT MAINLY IT'S A NICE WAY

19:11.358 --> 19:14.570
TO GET AWAY
FROM MY ARCH-NEMESIS.

19:14.653 --> 19:16.780
- THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK, FANBOY!

19:16.864 --> 19:19.408

19:37.384 --> 19:40.679
TOXIC TEA POT,
HOW EVER DID YOU FIND ME?

19:40.762 --> 19:44.266

19:44.349 --> 19:48.270
AFTER ALL,
I AM YOUR SWORN NEMESIS.

19:48.353 --> 19:48.854

TO WRAP THIS PICNIC UP.

LUPE!

20:15.589 --> 20:18.300

20:18.383 --> 20:20.302
- HOW COULD I
HAVE BEEN SO CARELESS?

20:20.385 --> 20:24.473
NOW YOU SEE WHY SUPERHEROES
CAN'T HAVE GIRLFRIENDS.

20:24.556 --> 20:25.641
YOU DO SEE THAT, RIGHT?

20:25.724 --> 20:26.975
