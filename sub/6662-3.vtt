00:05.080 --> 00:06.630
My name is Bridget.

00:06.670 --> 00:07.840
I witnessed a murder.

00:07.880 --> 00:09.210
Just get up
on the stand

00:09.250 --> 00:10.710
and tell the judge
what you saw.

00:10.760 --> 00:12.550
-We'll protect you.
-You don't get it.

00:12.590 --> 00:15.930
Bodaway wants me dead,
I'm dead.

00:15.970 --> 00:19.260
BRIDGET, VOICE-OVER: I ran
to my sister Siobhan for help.

00:19.310 --> 00:20.770
Siobhan! Siobhan!

00:20.810 --> 00:23.940
Siobhan killed herself,
and I assumed her identity.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.310
BRIDGET:
It was so easy.

00:25.350 --> 00:27.310
I saw a way out,
and I took it.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.190
They all think that I'm her.

Her husband,

00:30.780 --> 00:31.940

00:31.990 --> 00:33.280

him or me.

00:34.740 --> 00:35.910

I could trust.

00:37.570 --> 00:39.780
I thought I'd be safe.
Turns out I was wrong.

00:39.830 --> 00:43.660
You have the wrong girl!

00:43.710 --> 00:46.290
There's a lot about Siobhan's
life I don't know.

Siobhan?

01:20.700 --> 01:23.200
Don't think I've ever
seen you up this early.

01:23.240 --> 01:24.580
Huh.

01:24.620 --> 01:26.750
I couldn't sleep.

01:26.790 --> 01:29.210
Morning sickness?

01:29.250 --> 01:33.130
Not too pretty,
is it?

01:33.170 --> 01:34.550
Did Juliet make
her flight?

01:34.590 --> 01:36.220
Yes, she did.

01:36.260 --> 01:38.510
You really think it's a good
idea, sending her to Miami?

01:38.550 --> 01:40.720
If I didn't think
it was a good idea,

01:40.760 --> 01:42.350
I wouldn't have
suggested it.

01:42.390 --> 01:43.810
Sometimes...

01:43.850 --> 01:46.100
a girl just needs
her mom.

01:46.140 --> 01:48.730
Yeah, I can't believe Catherine
went for it, but she did.

01:48.770 --> 01:50.060
Just hope it helps.

01:51.400 --> 01:54.650
Oh, I, uh,
I made you some coffee.

01:56.400 --> 01:59.360
Is that so weird?

01:59.410 --> 02:01.280
No. I'll take it
with me to work.

02:01.320 --> 02:04.740
Oh, and, uh, by the way, I need
you to do something for me.

02:04.790 --> 02:06.700
What?

02:06.750 --> 02:08.330
It's a surprise.

02:08.370 --> 02:09.670
I'll leave the address
in the foyer.

02:09.710 --> 02:11.540

02:27.020 --> 02:30.350
No, I had an early morning
class I had to prepare for.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.020
I got your message.

02:32.060 --> 02:33.820
I don't think staying
in New York is a good idea.

02:33.860 --> 02:35.280
BRIDGET: Yeah, well,
neither is running.

02:35.320 --> 02:37.070
Bodaway wants me dead.

02:37.110 --> 02:39.610
Trust me, it is safer
as Siobhan.

02:39.650 --> 02:41.780
Well, if I can figure
out who's trying
to kill her.

02:41.820 --> 02:43.320
I thought you killed him.

02:43.370 --> 02:45.200
No, I think
he was a gun
for hire.

02:45.240 --> 02:46.580
Someone else is
behind this.

02:46.620 --> 02:48.290
All right, then.

02:48.330 --> 02:49.750
What are you doing to find
out who's after Siobhan?

02:49.790 --> 02:51.500
I have the hit man's
cell phone.

02:51.540 --> 02:54.000
Thinking maybe I could
trace it back to them.

02:54.040 --> 02:55.210
Did you check
the caller I.D.?

02:55.250 --> 02:56.500
No texts,

02:56.550 --> 02:58.720
no call history,
no pictures, nothing.

02:58.760 --> 02:59.920
Try prying the back off.

02:59.970 --> 03:01.130
Maybe you can find
a serial number.

03:01.180 --> 03:03.600
Oh...

03:03.640 --> 03:06.100
Wait. Hold on.

03:19.530 --> 03:21.030
Ow!

03:21.070 --> 03:22.280
Did you find
something?

Oh, my God...

Bridget?

03:35.340 --> 03:36.540
Are you there?

03:36.590 --> 03:38.000
Give me a sec.
I found something.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.370
Andrew's behind this?

04:22.220 --> 04:24.840
I'm not sure, but I
think Siobhan's husband

04:24.880 --> 04:26.390
might be behind the hit.

04:26.430 --> 04:27.800
Why do you think that?

04:27.850 --> 04:29.140
Because he has the same
picture on his shelf

04:29.180 --> 04:30.770
that was in
the hit man's pocket,

04:30.810 --> 04:32.520
but he was cropped
out of it,

04:32.560 --> 04:35.020
like somebody was trying
to protect his identity.

04:35.060 --> 04:37.190
That doesn't exactly
make him a killer.

04:37.230 --> 04:39.860
I know it's
a stretch, but Siobhan

04:39.900 --> 04:42.240
killed herself
for a reason, OK?

04:42.280 --> 04:43.820
I know that she
and Andrew

04:43.860 --> 04:45.410
were having problems.

04:45.450 --> 04:48.120
If he's behind this,
I kind of need to know.

04:48.160 --> 04:50.410
Listen to me--
don't just spin theories,

04:50.450 --> 04:51.620

there's a connection

-And, Bridge?

04:56.620 --> 04:58.210

Siobhan, then they're after you.

Aw, come on, what's
with this judge?

06:10.620 --> 06:12.030
He doesn't see probable
cause for the release

06:12.080 --> 06:13.280
of Siobhan Martin's
phone records.

06:13.330 --> 06:14.740
Too far removed
from Bodaway Macawi.

Siobhan Martin is the key

What more does he need?

06:19.460 --> 06:20.750
He didn't bother to say.

06:20.790 --> 06:22.920
No, no, of course not.

06:22.960 --> 06:25.090
OK, well,
find another judge.

06:25.130 --> 06:26.920
And when we get
the same answer, then what?

for Siobhan Martin

06:33.890 --> 06:35.720
to lead me
to Bridget Kelly.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.770
You don't even have any proof
that Kelly's still in New York.

you to go back to Wyoming,

We've been after Macawi
for ten years.

He's been involved
in armed robbery,

06:47.690 --> 06:49.400

trafficking,

06:49.450 --> 06:50.950

nine murders.

07:07.090 --> 07:08.550
Odds are right

07:08.590 --> 07:11.340
I believe Siobhan Martin
is harboring a fugitive,

07:11.380 --> 07:12.930

out about her,

07:12.970 --> 07:14.350

to Bridget.

09:32.650 --> 09:35.150

09:35.190 --> 09:38.660
Which is also why
I haven't learned French.

09:38.700 --> 09:40.280
A lot of my business
is done in English.

to fit you.

12:38.710 --> 12:41.630
-What is this, Gemma?
-Isn't it fabulous?

12:41.670 --> 12:43.340
Andrew planned
the whole thing

12:43.380 --> 12:44.840
as a thank you
for the party.

12:44.880 --> 12:46.510
Really?

12:46.550 --> 12:49.310
Is it that hard to
believe you have
an amazing husband?

12:49.350 --> 12:50.510
[chuckles]

12:51.890 --> 12:53.890
Thanks for coming
last night.

12:53.930 --> 12:55.440
Yeah, well, I hope
Gemma's outburst

12:55.480 --> 12:56.940
didn't ruin it for you.

12:56.980 --> 12:58.770
Well, hardly.
We landed six new investors.

12:58.810 --> 13:00.570
Good for you.

13:01.780 --> 13:03.690
Little early for that,
isn't it?

13:03.740 --> 13:05.650
Hey, you saw my wife.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.700
It's justified.

13:07.740 --> 13:10.660
So, since you're here
in an official capacity,

13:10.700 --> 13:11.910
let's get official.

13:11.950 --> 13:13.290
How can I help you?

13:13.330 --> 13:15.410
I want to
pull my investment.

13:15.460 --> 13:17.370
What?

13:18.630 --> 13:20.130
Why?

13:20.170 --> 13:22.130
We returned almost 20%
last month.

13:22.170 --> 13:24.550
Well, my editors are
giving me a hard time,

13:24.590 --> 13:26.800
and I think that
I might want to publish
the book myself.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.600
Self-publishing's hardly
wide-reaching.

13:29.640 --> 13:31.970
There have to be other
editors who are interested.

13:32.010 --> 13:34.060
Maybe, but that could
take about a year.

13:34.100 --> 13:36.190
I don't want to
keep waiting.

13:36.230 --> 13:37.730
Henry...

13:37.770 --> 13:40.900
you'd be walking away
from a lot of money.

13:40.940 --> 13:42.650
The market's
turning around.

13:42.690 --> 13:44.360
I'd hate for you
to miss out.

13:44.400 --> 13:45.950
Yeah, well, I've
been missing out

13:45.990 --> 13:47.450
on a lot lately.

13:47.490 --> 13:50.450
Sorry, Andrew,
my mind's made up.

13:55.790 --> 13:57.120
It's stunning.

13:57.160 --> 13:58.750
Yes.

13:58.790 --> 14:01.210
Champagne,
Mrs. Martin?

14:01.250 --> 14:03.500
-No. Thank you.
-Gemma?

14:03.550 --> 14:04.960
Oh, no. After last night,

14:05.010 --> 14:07.010
the sight of alcohol
makes me want to gag.

14:07.050 --> 14:09.970
So, is there something
that sings to you?

14:10.010 --> 14:12.470
They're all so beautiful.

14:12.510 --> 14:14.770
Well, don't limit
yourself to just one.

14:16.810 --> 14:18.560
Thank you
for this, Gemma.

14:18.600 --> 14:19.770
Don't thank me.

14:19.810 --> 14:20.980
Thank your husband.

14:21.020 --> 14:22.940
I'm just along
for the ride.

14:22.980 --> 14:24.940
Can you believe
he's taking you
to "Swan Lake"?

14:24.980 --> 14:26.190
He doesn't like
the ballet.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.400
He hates it.

14:27.440 --> 14:28.740
That's what makes
it so great.

14:28.780 --> 14:30.490
It's all about you.

14:30.530 --> 14:32.910
Why do you think
he's doing all this?

14:32.950 --> 14:35.080
Who cares why?

14:35.120 --> 14:37.410
You gotta stop being
suspicious, Siobh,

14:37.450 --> 14:39.210
and just enjoy.

14:39.250 --> 14:41.670
I guess I'm just
trying to...

14:41.710 --> 14:43.630
figure out what
his intentions are.

14:43.670 --> 14:45.500
The man is dressing you
in a custom-fitted gown

14:45.550 --> 14:47.630
for the ballet,

14:47.670 --> 14:49.760
and you're questioning
his intentions?

14:49.800 --> 14:52.680
You always do this.

14:52.720 --> 14:54.470
I do?

14:54.510 --> 14:56.220
You never think
what Andrew does

14:56.270 --> 14:57.810
is good enough.

14:57.850 --> 14:59.810
He used to make you
so happy.

14:59.850 --> 15:02.350
And then the two
of you started
snapping at each other

15:02.400 --> 15:04.020
and arguing a lot.

15:04.060 --> 15:06.650
Take it from someone
who has a husband

15:06.690 --> 15:08.530
to complain about--

15:08.570 --> 15:10.950
Andrew is a good man.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.450
Are you kidding me? I've got
Balthazar on speed dial.

15:15.490 --> 15:17.160
I can always get us in.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.790
I'm flagging
this cab.

15:18.830 --> 15:20.120
My heels
are killing me.

15:20.160 --> 15:22.790
Taxi.

15:22.830 --> 15:24.420
GREGOR: Have you had
the macaroni au gratin?

15:24.460 --> 15:26.130
It's to die for.

15:26.170 --> 15:28.420
[ringing]

15:28.460 --> 15:30.300
You coming?

15:30.340 --> 15:32.380
-You go ahead. I'll catch up.
-You sure?

15:32.430 --> 15:34.050
I-I have to take this.

15:34.090 --> 15:35.800
[ringing continues]

15:38.390 --> 15:40.390
Hello?

15:40.430 --> 15:42.480
MAN: Siobhan Martin?

15:42.520 --> 15:44.860
Who is this?

15:44.900 --> 15:47.020
You dropped your scarf.

15:59.580 --> 16:01.540
Who is this?

16:01.580 --> 16:03.080
What do you want?

16:03.120 --> 16:05.290
You have something of mine.

16:05.330 --> 16:08.420
I'm not going to
hurt you, Siobhan.

16:08.460 --> 16:11.720
Simply follow my instructions,
and this will all end.

16:13.760 --> 16:17.050
Why the hell
should I listen to you?

16:17.100 --> 16:19.100
You don't have a choice.

16:19.140 --> 16:21.180
You killed our mutual friend
in your loft.

16:21.230 --> 16:23.850
So unless you want me
to tell...

16:31.940 --> 16:34.780
Do you see that bench to your
right, next to the playground?

16:34.820 --> 16:37.620
Yeah?

16:37.660 --> 16:40.330
I want you to hang up and put
the phone down on the bench,

16:40.370 --> 16:42.290
then just walk away.

17:20.870 --> 17:22.160
Andrew?

17:24.290 --> 17:26.500
WOMAN: Operator.
How may I assist you?

17:26.540 --> 17:28.380
Hi. Uh, yeah.
I-I was wondering.

17:28.420 --> 17:30.750
Is it possible to trace
the last phone call
made to this phone?

17:30.790 --> 17:32.000
Let me see.

17:32.050 --> 17:33.210
That number's
blocked, ma'am.

17:33.260 --> 17:35.590
It's an emergency.

17:35.630 --> 17:37.590
Would you like me
to dial 911?

17:37.630 --> 17:39.430
No. That won't
be necessary.

17:40.850 --> 17:42.310
[sighs]

17:44.480 --> 17:46.190
[dialing]

18:04.580 --> 18:07.000
[vibrating]

18:07.040 --> 18:08.830
[recording]: You've reached
Professor Malcolm Ward.

18:08.870 --> 18:10.500
Please leave a message
at the tone.

18:10.540 --> 18:12.130
[drops phone]

18:23.560 --> 18:25.600
[phone ringing]

18:28.640 --> 18:29.850
Hello?

18:29.900 --> 18:31.730
What the hell
happened to you?

18:31.770 --> 18:33.440
You never showed up
for lunch.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.780
Oh, Gemma, I'm so sorry.

18:35.820 --> 18:37.030
Everything OK?

18:37.070 --> 18:38.280
Yeah, it's fine.

18:38.320 --> 18:39.490
I, um...

18:39.530 --> 18:41.410
It was...
my doctor calling.

18:41.450 --> 18:44.620
I forgot about my
first trimester tests.

18:44.660 --> 18:46.370
Oh, I remember those.

18:46.410 --> 18:48.960
Don't worry. The baby's
gonna be perfect.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.290
So Gregor got us tickets
to fashion week.

18:52.330 --> 18:53.790
Can you believe it?

18:53.840 --> 18:55.130
That's great.

18:55.170 --> 18:57.630
Hello?! Did you hear
what I just said?

18:57.670 --> 18:59.220
It's going to be
you, me,

18:59.260 --> 19:01.590
and Anna Wintour
in the front row.

19:01.640 --> 19:05.010
I'm sorry. I...
I'm just a little distracted.

19:05.060 --> 19:08.890
Do you know a Pierce,
Zimmerman & McDonald?

19:08.930 --> 19:10.890
Isn't that
Aubrey Zimmerman's firm?

19:10.940 --> 19:12.270
Aubrey Zimmerman.

19:12.310 --> 19:14.060
The big-time divorce
lawyer?

19:14.110 --> 19:15.440
What made you think
of them?

19:15.480 --> 19:17.030
I was, um...

19:17.070 --> 19:18.940
just reading some
trashy magazine.

19:18.990 --> 19:20.950
I guess some celebrity's
getting divorced.

19:20.990 --> 19:23.370
Huh. Maybe I'm the one
who should be hiring

19:23.410 --> 19:24.950
Aubrey Zimmerman.

19:31.620 --> 19:32.790
[door closes]

19:32.830 --> 19:34.290
Henry Butler

19:34.330 --> 19:36.040
wants to pull out
of the hedge fund?

19:36.090 --> 19:38.130
Apparently, he needs the money
to self-publish his novel.

19:38.170 --> 19:40.920
Then put it online
for a hundred bucks.

19:40.970 --> 19:43.550
Don't throw your wife's
hard-earned money
down the toilet.

19:43.590 --> 19:45.300
I agree.

19:45.350 --> 19:48.100
Well, then how come
you didn't talk
him out of it?

19:48.140 --> 19:49.930
Because he's a friend.

19:49.980 --> 19:52.100
If he wants to pull out, I'm
not going to stand in his way.

19:52.140 --> 19:54.060
Then I'll be happy to.

19:54.100 --> 19:55.940
Come on, Olivia. They have
maybe 300 grand with us.

19:55.980 --> 19:57.320
It's not worth it.

19:57.360 --> 19:59.740
I don't care
about Henry's money.

19:59.780 --> 20:02.700
But I do care
about Gemma's father.

20:02.740 --> 20:05.240
This is about
Tim Arbogast?

20:05.280 --> 20:06.950
You know he's been
with Faerber Funds

20:06.990 --> 20:08.790
for about 20 years now.

20:08.830 --> 20:10.120
And we'll
never have a chance

20:10.160 --> 20:11.910
at his millions
if we lose the Butlers.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.540
I'm not going
after Arbogast.

20:13.580 --> 20:16.290
I tried that once before, and
it was disaster. Let it go.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.880
Do I need to remind you
what's at stake?

20:18.920 --> 20:20.590
Drop it.

20:20.630 --> 20:22.720
I'm not looking
to make enemies.

20:22.760 --> 20:25.300
Let the Butlers cash out.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.470
Fine.

20:28.510 --> 20:30.310
I'll take care of it.

20:36.690 --> 20:38.150
Ah!

20:38.190 --> 20:39.520
Whew!

20:39.570 --> 20:40.730
Siobhan,
you walked

20:40.780 --> 20:42.490
right past me
in the lobby.

20:42.530 --> 20:44.530
Oh, sorry. I, um...

20:44.570 --> 20:47.160
M-my head's just
somewhere else today.

20:49.740 --> 20:51.660
-How's the family?
-Oh, great.

20:51.700 --> 20:53.000
You know,
back-to-school time.

20:53.040 --> 20:54.870
Wally's rowing crew,

20:54.920 --> 20:56.580
and Becca's going
into the eighth grade.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.500
Well, you know all
about that with Juliet.

20:58.540 --> 21:00.170
Of course.

21:00.210 --> 21:01.840
And Jack is still
pounding the pavement

21:01.880 --> 21:03.380
for Deltana
& Abercamp.

21:03.420 --> 21:04.590
What about you guys?

21:04.630 --> 21:06.010
I thought I'd see
you and Andrew

21:06.050 --> 21:07.720
at Gatsby on the Green.
You never miss it.

21:07.760 --> 21:10.600
We've just been
so busy lately.

21:10.640 --> 21:12.640
This is me.

21:12.680 --> 21:14.940
Say hi to Jack
and the kids for me.

21:14.980 --> 21:16.940
We should have lunch.

21:16.980 --> 21:19.650
Really? OK.
I'd love that.

21:19.690 --> 21:22.070
MAN: I didn't think I'd be
seeing you again, Siobhan.

21:22.110 --> 21:24.190
So, were you able to find

21:24.240 --> 21:26.320
the answers you
were looking for?

21:26.360 --> 21:28.700
You were pretty upset
the last time you were here.

21:28.740 --> 21:30.620
I hope I didn't
say anything

21:30.660 --> 21:32.240
that I might regret.

21:32.290 --> 21:34.040
Well, the way
I remember it,

21:34.080 --> 21:36.830
you were adamant about altering
the prenuptial agreement,

21:36.870 --> 21:40.090
but I never received
any changes, so I figured--

21:40.130 --> 21:44.920
I hoped--that you and Andrew
had worked things out.

21:44.970 --> 21:48.050
Though, if you did,
you probably wouldn't
be here, would you?

21:48.090 --> 21:52.810
Did I mention how bad
the fighting had gotten?

21:52.850 --> 21:54.470
You did.

21:54.520 --> 21:57.270
Has it gotten physical?

21:59.270 --> 22:02.230
Did I give you the
impression that it had?

22:02.270 --> 22:05.070
Mmm, call it intuition
or years of experience,

22:05.110 --> 22:09.110
but I got the feeling that you
were scared of your husband.

22:10.320 --> 22:12.660
Really? Scared?

22:12.700 --> 22:16.080
-Your life seems perfect.
-Close to it.

22:16.120 --> 22:17.830
But no one's life
is perfect.

22:19.580 --> 22:21.630
I don't mean to make you
uncomfortable, Siobhan.

22:21.670 --> 22:24.420
My only point is that
if there's been abuse,

22:24.460 --> 22:28.340
your divorce case will
be drastically different.

22:28.380 --> 22:30.800
We can certainly
revisit this subject

22:30.840 --> 22:33.260
when you feel
more comfortable.

22:33.310 --> 22:34.890
My office managed to
track down

22:34.930 --> 22:36.480
the quitclaim deed
you signed

22:36.520 --> 22:38.310
for 227 Pratt Street.

22:38.350 --> 22:40.480
You may have been right
that he was trying to hide

22:40.520 --> 22:42.610
the value of this
particular investment.

22:42.650 --> 22:45.730
I'm sorry. Could
you remind me about
that property again?

22:45.780 --> 22:48.700
It's a building that
Andrew's company acquired.

22:48.740 --> 22:51.450
This is only a Xeroxed copy,
but from the looks of it,

22:51.490 --> 22:53.280
the date might
have been changed.

22:54.950 --> 22:56.500
Which means?

22:56.540 --> 22:57.830
To be blunt,

22:57.870 --> 22:59.790
your husband's trying
to cheat you.

22:59.830 --> 23:02.210
Now, if you can find
the original deed

23:02.250 --> 23:04.380
and if the date
is different,

23:04.420 --> 23:08.130
you'd have a real opportunity
to claim 50% of that property.

23:28.900 --> 23:30.860
ANDREW: Siobhan?

23:33.740 --> 23:34.910
Do you want
to tell me why

23:34.950 --> 23:36.740
you went to see
a divorce attorney?

I know that yesterday
you withdrew $50,000

missed a dance class

society meeting.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.920
Both of them were

you always do.

that if anything
happens to me

there gets this phone,

32:06.170 --> 32:08.170
Why was she
even involved?

32:08.210 --> 32:09.920
Because her name's
on the portfolio.

32:09.960 --> 32:11.260
It's protocol.

32:11.300 --> 32:12.630

the purse strings
our entire marriage,

32:15.470 --> 32:16.640

to you directly

32:16.680 --> 32:18.100
might allow me to
make a decision

32:18.140 --> 32:20.270

her permission.

32:20.310 --> 32:21.640
I can't possibly know
what you will or won't
discuss with your wife.

35:50.060 --> 35:53.860
I went to see him
a while ago...

35:53.900 --> 35:57.530
when things between
us were tense.

35:57.570 --> 35:59.820
That's putting
it lightly.

35:59.860 --> 36:02.320
I know.

36:02.360 --> 36:05.910
Which is why I was
weighing my options.

36:07.740 --> 36:09.540
And then things

36:09.580 --> 36:11.460
seemed to get
better between us.

36:11.500 --> 36:15.040
So I went today to
call it off.

36:19.800 --> 36:23.300
Why should I believe you?

36:23.340 --> 36:26.100
I'll be honest.

36:26.140 --> 36:29.680
I thought some really
awful things about you.

36:29.720 --> 36:32.690
But it was

36:32.730 --> 36:37.060
entirely based on fear.

36:37.110 --> 36:39.440
And I realized...

36:39.480 --> 36:40.940
if we're gonna
move forward,

36:40.990 --> 36:43.740
then I have to
stop listening

36:43.780 --> 36:45.820
to other people

36:45.870 --> 36:48.280
and trust you.

36:51.370 --> 36:54.330
Do you think you
can forgive me?

37:15.900 --> 37:20.070
And what you did
for me today,

37:20.110 --> 37:22.150
it wasn't that it
wasn't good enough.

37:24.650 --> 37:26.570
It was the nicest thing

37:26.610 --> 37:28.780
that anyone's ever
done for me.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.170
You look beautiful.

37:46.590 --> 37:49.800
Don't do this, please!

37:52.930 --> 37:55.350
No!

37:55.390 --> 37:57.020
Stay still, junkie!

38:03.070 --> 38:05.030
Enjoy your trip.

38:08.240 --> 38:10.160
[shallow gasps]

38:31.260 --> 38:34.850
This view is
really stunning.

38:34.890 --> 38:38.520
You say that like you've
never seen it before.

38:40.100 --> 38:43.440
I guess I'm just trying
to look at things

38:43.480 --> 38:45.190
with a new appreciation.

38:45.230 --> 38:48.360
OK, then.

38:48.400 --> 38:50.870
OK, then what?

38:50.910 --> 38:53.620
If I'm asking you
to trust me,

38:53.660 --> 38:56.200
then I have to trust you.

39:00.250 --> 39:02.290
I hope from this
point on,

39:02.340 --> 39:05.300
we can be honest
with each other.

39:09.680 --> 39:12.260
I want that, too.

39:17.980 --> 39:20.480
What we used
to have together was...

39:20.520 --> 39:22.650
pretty amazing.

39:24.230 --> 39:25.780
And if there was
any chance

39:25.820 --> 39:27.280
of getting that back...

39:31.280 --> 39:33.870
[phone ringing]

39:36.990 --> 39:38.540
Hello?

39:39.870 --> 39:42.210
Hello?

39:45.040 --> 39:47.460
HENRY: Hello?

39:49.550 --> 39:52.340
Anybody there?
