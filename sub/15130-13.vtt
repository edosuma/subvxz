WEBVTT

00:01.634 --> 00:04.536
(man) so, alex, how long have
you and joel known each other?

00:04.538 --> 00:07.306
(alex) um, since med school.
(joel) yeah, we're old friends.

00:07.308 --> 00:11.276
What... Forever? We--
we grew up on the same block.

00:11.278 --> 00:15.581
Yeah. Yeah, he put up
a good fight, but--
she was a vicious kid.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.750
She ended up with
the paper route and my lunch.

00:17.752 --> 00:20.319
Wow.
Nobody puts sonja
in a corner.

00:20.321 --> 00:21.720
Excuse me.

00:21.722 --> 00:24.490
And, uh, when I get back.
I wanna know what it's like

00:24.492 --> 00:26.625
To have your hands
inside of a man's guts.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.527
Will do.

00:28.529 --> 00:32.598
That was really smooth, seth.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.533
This is a date, isn't it?
You set me up.

00:34.535 --> 00:37.469
Honestly, I didn't know
this was planned.

00:37.471 --> 00:39.271
Alex, I just--I-I thought
you guys would get along.

00:39.273 --> 00:41.040
I mean, seth--he's great.

00:41.042 --> 00:43.509
And he inherited this
crazy business from his dad--

00:43.511 --> 00:45.477
Building aboveground pools
in the summer

00:45.479 --> 00:49.648
And then backyard rinks
in the winter.
(seth screaming)

00:49.650 --> 00:52.117
(grunting)
seth, what's happening?

00:52.119 --> 00:53.318
I can't get my hand out.

00:53.320 --> 00:54.586
Okay. Uh, sonja,
go see if the waitress

00:54.588 --> 00:57.056
Has a key to this thing, okay?
Okay.

00:57.058 --> 00:59.458
The equipment inside could be
tamponading a bleeder.
Tamponading a what?!

00:59.460 --> 01:02.795
We need to dismantle this
in the e.R. Let's...

01:02.797 --> 01:04.596
Let's take this off
the wall, okay?
(continues grunting)

01:04.598 --> 01:08.367
Try not to move your hand,
seth, while we pull, okay?
(whispers) okay.

01:08.369 --> 01:09.401
Okay?
On three?

01:09.403 --> 01:11.503
One, two...

01:11.505 --> 01:14.573
â™ª

01:19.179 --> 01:20.712
(seth grunting and panting)

01:20.714 --> 01:23.549
Joel. Alex.
Zach, this is seth rollins.

01:23.551 --> 01:26.218
He got his hand stuck in--
I see that.
In a condom machine.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.686
(strained voice)
and I'm in agony.
Try to be calm.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.088
Weren't you two
off work tonight?

01:29.090 --> 01:33.158
Okay, hang in there, seth.
Okay, we're gonna get you
some painkillers, seth.

01:33.160 --> 01:35.828
(groans)
seth, I'm dr. Miller.

01:35.830 --> 01:39.231
You got that machine?
On three...
Yes, I have.

01:39.233 --> 01:43.302
(grunts)
ma'am, if you can wait
in the waiting room,please?

01:43.304 --> 01:44.803
That'd be great. Thanks.
Zach, you remember sonja,
right?

01:44.805 --> 01:46.572
Seth, he's--
he's a friend of mine.

01:46.574 --> 01:50.209
Hi... Again. All right,
well, let's get him on I.V.

01:50.211 --> 01:52.511
And give him, uh...
2 milligrams of morphine.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.546
When was your last tetanus shot?
I don't know.

01:54.548 --> 01:56.215
Okay, let's give him
.5 ccs I.M.

01:56.217 --> 01:58.550
And let's page ortho.
There's no need.
I'm right here.

01:58.552 --> 02:01.253
Seth, just hang in there,
okay?
(panting)

02:01.255 --> 02:02.488
All right,
who's on call tonight?
Maggie.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.289
Not charlie?
Nope. Maggie.

02:04.291 --> 02:06.325
All right, seth, why don't
you explain to me step-by-step

02:06.327 --> 02:07.826
What exactly happened here?

02:07.828 --> 02:10.796
Well, I reached my hand inside.
I paid, by the way.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.599
When I tried to pull it out,
it got stuck.
I get it.

02:13.601 --> 02:16.435
You gotta put in a sling
if you want some bling, right?
(grunts)

02:16.437 --> 02:18.904
(chuckles) what? Come on,
I got so many more of those.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.439
Okay, let's open up
this contraption,

02:20.441 --> 02:22.508
See what's going on inside.
You're gonna need a--

02:22.510 --> 02:24.510
Screwdriver, please!
(groans)

02:24.512 --> 02:28.647
Covering call again, charlie?
Yeah, you, too?

02:28.649 --> 02:31.350
Student loans.
I remember those days.

02:31.352 --> 02:32.651
North american reptile
convention

02:32.653 --> 02:34.620
Is down at metro hall.
Tonight's the big party

02:34.622 --> 02:37.689
And I'll be missing it.
You a snake man?

02:37.691 --> 02:40.759
Snakes and ladies.
You surprise me, jackson.

02:40.761 --> 02:45.264
Thanks... I think.
(pen clicks)

02:45.266 --> 02:47.933
Corporal fran seymour,
I am dr. Harris.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.701
Doc.
I hear you were skydiving,

02:49.703 --> 02:51.436
Made a pretty dramatic
landing.

02:51.438 --> 02:52.838
Incomplete deployment
of the first parachute.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.373
I cut away and deployed
the second,

02:54.375 --> 02:56.275
But it was already
too close to the ground.

02:56.277 --> 02:59.311
But you landed on your feet.
I'm like a cat.

02:59.313 --> 03:02.814
Tried to walk it off,
but, uh, no dice.

03:02.816 --> 03:05.918
How does it look?
Uh, bones in both
of your heels

03:05.920 --> 03:06.952
Are pretty badly shattered.

03:06.954 --> 03:09.188
How long am I on the shelf?

03:09.190 --> 03:10.522
Well, the bohler's angle's okay,
so you won't need surgery,

03:10.524 --> 03:12.291
But I'm gonna need
to put casts on both feet

03:12.293 --> 03:13.492
So you'll be out
for a while.

03:13.494 --> 03:15.394
What's "a while"?
Eight weeks.

03:15.396 --> 03:18.764
Six weeks before
I redeploy.
(scissors snipping)

03:18.766 --> 03:20.866
To?
Afghanistan.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.434
Wait a minute. I thought
everyone was coming home.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.736
This is our final...
(strains) mission,

03:24.738 --> 03:27.573
And I ain't missin' it.
(groans)

03:27.575 --> 03:31.410
You ever jump out of a plane?
I'm more into zumba.

03:31.412 --> 03:32.978
(chuckles)

03:36.983 --> 03:38.684
Now, corporal,
anything else bothering you

03:38.686 --> 03:40.953
Besides your heels?
No, all good.

03:40.955 --> 03:45.257
Doesn't pay to be
a hero around here, trust me.

03:45.259 --> 03:48.660
Some, uh, pins and needles
in my legs.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.829
No big deal.
Sure it'll go away. (chuckles)

03:50.831 --> 03:52.598
Okay. Can you feel this?

03:52.600 --> 03:55.834
A little. It's a bit numb.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.769
Okay.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.871
Flex your feet for me, please.
Toes to the ceiling.

04:03.876 --> 04:06.511
(exhales sharply)

04:06.513 --> 04:08.880
(siren wails in distance)
okay.

04:08.882 --> 04:12.985
(grunts)
I'm gonna have jackson
take you up for a c.T.

04:12.987 --> 04:14.920
I want to make sure you don't
have any spinal fractures.
(pen clicks)

04:14.922 --> 04:17.256
Don't worry,
it's strictly precautionary.

04:17.258 --> 04:22.294
(chuckles) I'm not worried.
I got nine lives.

04:22.296 --> 04:23.462
And you can, uh,
you can tell your buddy

04:23.464 --> 04:25.631
To come in, if you'd like.
What buddy?

04:34.474 --> 04:37.042
Uh...

04:37.044 --> 04:38.744
My mistake.

04:38.746 --> 04:40.279
You're almost there, pal.

04:40.281 --> 04:41.446
The good news
is you'll have more condoms

04:41.448 --> 04:43.515
Than you know what to do with.
(chuckles)

04:43.517 --> 04:47.052
But I'm genuinely
embarrassed here.
And we got it.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.387
All right.
(clattering)

04:48.389 --> 04:50.889
Ready?
You okay, whoa!

04:50.891 --> 04:54.693
Gauze, lots of gauze!
Get the gauze.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.928
(clattering)
all right.

04:56.930 --> 05:00.465
I got 'em.
Okay, let's get those
on ice, please.

05:00.467 --> 05:01.667
Seth, look at me.
Look at me.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.535
Try to take deep,
slow breaths.

05:03.537 --> 05:06.004
(grunts and
breathes heavily)

05:12.011 --> 05:15.314
So I will be doing
your finger replant, seth.

05:15.316 --> 05:17.983
Fingers, plural.
Yeah, look,
it's a long surgery, too.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.818
So we don't want
to wait around

05:19.820 --> 05:23.322
In case ischemia sets in
and then you lose your fingers.

05:23.324 --> 05:25.357
Okay. I appreciate
your haste.

05:25.359 --> 05:26.491
Absolutely. Look,
the nurse will be by

05:26.493 --> 05:28.927
To prep you soon. And, uh,

05:28.929 --> 05:30.329
In the meantime, just...
Sit tight.

05:30.331 --> 05:32.931
Sit tight, okay?

05:32.933 --> 05:35.400
Alex.
Yes.

05:35.402 --> 05:38.603
I'd like to explain--
don't worry.

05:38.605 --> 05:41.373
Joel is an amazing surgeon.

05:43.409 --> 05:46.411
(sighs)

05:46.413 --> 05:49.481
(indistinct conversations)

05:52.086 --> 05:56.722
Hi. Seth is fine.
We're managing his pain,

05:56.724 --> 05:58.990
And joel is prepping to do
his finger replantation.

05:58.992 --> 06:01.426
Wait, so you--you can sew
the fingers back on?

06:01.428 --> 06:03.929
Yes, we should be able to.
Okay.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.864
God, I just--

06:05.866 --> 06:07.399
I feel like this
is all my fault.

06:07.401 --> 06:09.468
It's not.
I know, but still.
And--and--

06:09.470 --> 06:11.470
And I really have to go
and relieve my babysitter.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.538
It's nobody's fault.
And he's got joel.
Right.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.608
Yeah. And, I mean, joel, he--
he saved my life once.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.009
He's that good.
Yeah.

06:18.011 --> 06:20.579
And... (chuckles)
seth, he really is--I mean,

06:20.581 --> 06:24.416
He's just--he's genuinely
a really sweet guy.

06:24.418 --> 06:26.818
I'm sure he is. I'm just...

06:26.820 --> 06:27.986
I'm not dating right now.

06:27.988 --> 06:32.090
Yeah, totally. Okay.
No more cupid.

06:35.061 --> 06:39.731
Joel and I are just friends.
Thanks, alex.

06:44.036 --> 06:46.938
Take care of seth.
Will do.

06:52.145 --> 06:55.013
Oh, alex. Tell me all.

06:55.015 --> 06:57.549
Has word already spread?
We live in a viral age.

06:57.551 --> 07:00.919
Once a secret gets out,
it's uncontainable.
(sighs)

07:00.921 --> 07:02.754
You're the one who made me
come up with the breakup plan.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.590
Oh, don't blame the plan.
The plan is solid.

07:05.592 --> 07:06.758
You said,
"get out of the house."

07:06.760 --> 07:08.160
I did that,
and look what happened.

07:08.162 --> 07:10.128
Did he really lose three fingers
in a condom machine?

07:10.130 --> 07:13.532
Yes.
So you two were gonna
get busy?

07:13.534 --> 07:14.966
No, we were not going
to "get busy."

07:14.968 --> 07:16.968
He was sprung on me--
a surprise double date.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.838
I just really, really don't want
charlie to hear about it.

07:19.840 --> 07:23.208
(chuckles) honey, welcome to
the weird and awkward world...
(cell phone buzzing)

07:23.210 --> 07:26.611
Of post-breakup.
Not lovin' it.

07:28.481 --> 07:29.581
Dr. Reid.

07:29.583 --> 07:32.684
So I was doing some
figuring,

07:32.686 --> 07:34.853
And your board exams
are this March.
Yeah, and I'll be

07:34.855 --> 07:37.622
Dr. Margaret lin. M.D.
F.R.C.S.C,

07:37.624 --> 07:41.126
And I'll expect
a little respect, mister.

07:41.128 --> 07:44.162
And the baby will already
be born.
Yeah...

07:44.164 --> 07:46.565
(chuckles) wow.
(chuckles)

07:46.567 --> 07:48.900
How's that gonna work?
That exam takes a full day.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.235
The baby will stay
in a sling,

07:50.237 --> 07:52.003
And I'll breast feed
on demand.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.506
Not even gonna respond
to that. That's crazy.

07:54.508 --> 08:00.078
(sighs) is that decaf?
No, it's coffee.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.080
(slurps)
you could at least try it.

08:02.082 --> 08:04.983
Or at least half-caf.
It tastes the same.
No, it doesn't.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.818
The baby shouldn't be
all hopped up on caffeine.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.153
I'm not suddenly
a different person, gavin.
(tone sounds)

08:08.155 --> 08:09.955
Sorry.
No, I know you're not.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.623
I'm just pregnant.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.969
Yeah, she's pregnant.
Okay, I, uh...

08:23.971 --> 08:25.604
(chuckles)
I heard that. Well...

08:25.606 --> 08:28.173
We're not telling people,
though. It's just...

08:28.175 --> 08:29.875
Really, we're just
early on.

08:29.877 --> 08:33.111
Okay. That's good.
Well... Big ups, bro.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.080
Well... (chuckles)
(chuckles)

08:35.082 --> 08:38.683
That's good.
Your boys can swim.
(whispers) yeah.

08:38.685 --> 08:41.853
(baby crying in distance)

08:41.855 --> 08:44.222
(curtain rings swoosh)
seth.

08:44.224 --> 08:46.725
(panting)
I hear you've been experiencing
some abdominal pain.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.960
Yeah, and in my back.
Okay.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.997
(grunts) I'm happy
I get a chance to explain.

08:51.999 --> 08:54.165
You don't have to,
really.
I do.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.735
The whole condom thing--
I'm just gonna palpate
your abdomen.

08:56.737 --> 08:57.903
Okay.
Okay.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.004
(machinery beeps)

08:59.006 --> 09:00.171
(grunts)
ow.

09:00.173 --> 09:03.608
I did not assume
that I needed a condom.

09:03.610 --> 09:05.810
I just--I thought
you were amazing.

09:05.812 --> 09:07.846
You    <i>a</i>amazing.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.147
(strained voice)
and you're a doctor.

09:09.149 --> 09:13.118
And I just thought
if we... You know,

09:13.120 --> 09:17.989
I'd feel irresponsible
if I wasn't prepared.

09:17.991 --> 09:20.191
'cause you're a doctor.
(exhales deeply)

09:20.193 --> 09:22.561
And the whole
safe sex thing...

09:22.563 --> 09:25.597
If that's even something
that people talk about still.

09:25.599 --> 09:29.634
Just try to relax,
if you can, okay?
(grunts) okay.

09:29.636 --> 09:32.237
I don't get out there much--

09:32.239 --> 09:34.039
You know, dating?

09:34.041 --> 09:36.708
I think I just
got ahead of myself.
Mm-hmm.

09:36.710 --> 09:39.177
You know... Ow!

09:39.179 --> 09:40.912
Okay, the pain is the most
intense there, right?

09:40.914 --> 09:42.914
(sobbing) yeah...

09:42.916 --> 09:46.017
That hurts worse than
the fingers.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.886
Or where they used to be.
Seth?

09:47.888 --> 09:49.788
I'm feeling
a pulsating mass.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.590
I'm guessing that's not
the good kind.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.124
Can I get some help in here?

09:53.126 --> 09:54.593
Uhh.
I'm going to get you
a c.T.

09:54.595 --> 09:57.996
(continues sobbing)
give him bolus.

09:57.998 --> 10:01.066
Fran, you do have
a small spinal fracture

10:01.068 --> 10:02.634
From your skydiving accident.

10:02.636 --> 10:05.003
No. Really?
Yeah.

10:05.005 --> 10:07.238
I can fix it, but we need
to do it right away.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.674
What's the recovery time
on that?
Three months.

10:09.676 --> 10:13.111
I got six weeks.
So let's get this done.

10:13.113 --> 10:17.716
Uh, there's something else
I need to discuss with you.

10:17.718 --> 10:20.685
This showed up on your c.T.

10:20.687 --> 10:23.855
What am I looking at?
Uh, it would appear
to be shrapnel.

10:23.857 --> 10:26.725
Shrapnel?

10:26.727 --> 10:29.761
<i>Reporting for duty, sir.</i>

10:33.199 --> 10:36.835
Um... I'd like to have
a look at your back, if I could.

10:36.837 --> 10:40.739
Yeah.

10:40.741 --> 10:44.809
A pretty serious accident.
I'd rather not talk about it.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.813
Okay.

10:48.815 --> 10:49.914
Well, I'll have a look at it

10:49.916 --> 10:53.385
If it's impinging on the spine,
I will remove it.

10:53.387 --> 10:55.253
If it's not causing
any trouble,

10:55.255 --> 10:57.822
Generally, we just leave
shrapnel where it is.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.691
Do what you gotta do.

11:01.694 --> 11:03.261
Okay.

11:16.776 --> 11:19.811
(blinds clattering)

11:19.813 --> 11:22.247
Okay, what do you want?

11:22.249 --> 11:24.949
<i>Reporting for duty, sir.</i>
<i>Yeah, I got that.</i>

11:24.951 --> 11:27.819
Um, what's your name?
<i>I don't know, sir.</i>

11:27.821 --> 11:30.121
It says there, "mccreary."

11:30.123 --> 11:31.923
<i>So it does, sir.</i>

11:31.925 --> 11:35.260
(sighs)
your body's in the morgue?

11:35.262 --> 11:37.328
<i>Sir?</i>
<i>What are you doing here,</i>
<i>private?</i>

11:37.330 --> 11:38.363
<i>Just sticking with my unit.</i>

11:38.365 --> 11:40.398
Okay.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.233
Um, here's what
we're gonna do.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.902
You're gonna figure out
what it is you need from me,

11:43.904 --> 11:45.470
We'll talk,
and you'll go away. Okay?

11:45.472 --> 11:47.739
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

11:49.275 --> 11:50.408
At ease.

11:50.410 --> 11:53.878
(door opens)

11:53.880 --> 11:57.115
(coughs and sniffles)
ugh!

11:57.117 --> 11:58.817
(sighs)

11:58.819 --> 12:01.853
Does sleeping in the nude
give you a cold?

12:01.855 --> 12:03.288
Mm, not that alone, no.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.857
I'm seeing this guy,
and he's really into

12:05.859 --> 12:07.726
Sleeping all night
with nothing on.

12:07.728 --> 12:10.395
Enjoy your nudity, fella.
I'm just gonna freeze over here.

12:10.397 --> 12:13.031
I guess I just like him,
though.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.733
Yeah, that's how
it all starts.

12:14.735 --> 12:18.870
Yeah...
But I do like him.
Mm-hmm.

12:18.872 --> 12:21.172
Of course you do.
We all do.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.208
Until finally one day
we're like,

12:23.210 --> 12:25.076
"you know what?
You're not the boss of me."

12:25.078 --> 12:27.011
Maybe you're right.

12:27.013 --> 12:28.980
I don't know, though.
(chuckles)

12:28.982 --> 12:30.949
(instrument clatters)

12:30.951 --> 12:32.150
I came in
a couple weeks ago,

12:32.152 --> 12:36.154
Cold and flu medicine.
I saw you
a couple weeks ago?

12:36.156 --> 12:37.288
Yeah, I thought I had
meningitis or something,

12:37.290 --> 12:38.490
But you couldn't
see anything.

12:38.492 --> 12:41.292
I remember you now.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.228
Dr. Lin?
Yeah?

12:43.230 --> 12:44.329
Can I talk to you
for a moment?

12:44.331 --> 12:46.831
Yeah, I'll be right back,
okay?

12:49.135 --> 12:52.937
What's up?
I've got jenny's blood work.
It came...

12:52.939 --> 12:55.106
Back positive for c.M.V.
Okay, I'll tell her.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.275
Okay, but wait.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.277
It says on her chart that
you saw her a couple weeks ago

12:59.279 --> 13:00.879
And she was asymptomatic.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.180
Yeah, but she'll be fine.
It's a flu virus.

13:02.182 --> 13:06.017
I mean, unless she's pregnant.

13:06.019 --> 13:09.954
There's a risk that it could
cross the placental barrier.

13:09.956 --> 13:13.158
Yeah.
Yeah.

13:13.160 --> 13:16.261
You better get tested.
Mm-hmm.

13:30.442 --> 13:33.411
Hi.
Hi.

13:33.413 --> 13:36.281
Um, something's come up--
did you forget to take
your prenatal iron?

13:36.283 --> 13:38.583
No, I didn't--
'cause I could write
a scrip for you

13:38.585 --> 13:40.451
If you need some.
That won't be necessary.

13:40.453 --> 13:43.555
And just so you know,
I, uh, also took my folic acid,

13:43.557 --> 13:47.926
Took my omega-3 fatty acids,
and did my kegel exercises.
(elevator bell dings)

13:47.928 --> 13:51.129
So... Don't worry.
Maggie.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.097
Mm-hmm.

13:53.099 --> 13:54.966
Seth, the results
of the c.T. Angiogram are back.

13:54.968 --> 13:57.135
You have a leaking
aortic aneurysm.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.970
Is that bad?
That sounds bad.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.572
It's worse than
losing three fingers.

14:00.574 --> 14:02.440
Your aorta is a big,
very important blood vessel

14:02.442 --> 14:05.009
That carries blood
from the heart to your organs.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.145
So the fingers
are gonna have to wait.

14:07.147 --> 14:09.080
No, they can't wait.
Life over limb, joel.

14:09.082 --> 14:11.015
We have to go in now
and together.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.584
Both surgeries
at the same time?

14:12.586 --> 14:14.052
Yes, sir.

14:14.054 --> 14:16.421
(sighs)
(wheels clacking)

14:16.423 --> 14:19.290
Look, I can't risk those
fingers becoming garbage

14:19.292 --> 14:23.962
Fine. Stay out of my way.
Triple a is a time bomb.

14:27.867 --> 14:32.036
(wheels clacking)

14:32.038 --> 14:33.371
I bet this isn't
what you had in mind

14:33.373 --> 14:36.174
When sonja said,
"come meet this guy."

14:36.176 --> 14:39.577
She didn't say that.
Oh.

14:39.579 --> 14:42.280
Sorry. That's the worst.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.249
But I think we can
turn this around.

14:44.251 --> 14:45.884
I'll see you in recovery.

14:48.020 --> 14:50.188
(sighs)

14:50.190 --> 14:52.156
(machinery beeps)

14:52.158 --> 14:53.958
(turns faucet on,
both scrubbing hands)

14:53.960 --> 14:56.561
Hey, I apologize, by the way.

14:56.563 --> 15:01.432
Bringing a friend.
So you and sonja
are back together again then?

15:01.434 --> 15:05.570
Well, we're trying.
You know, it's complicated.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.906
(sighs) we have a problem.

15:07.908 --> 15:09.474
(turns faucet off,
water gurgles)
another problem?

15:09.476 --> 15:11.009
I-I can't put him under.
He's too high-risk.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.477
What more can happen
to this guy?

15:12.479 --> 15:15.980
His mallampati score is 4.
He has a malformed airway.

15:15.982 --> 15:19.617
It's like a fusilli in there.
<i>And</i> he has a heart murmur.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.119
I won't be able
to intubate.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.987
Okay, well, I have to get at
the aneurysm.

15:22.989 --> 15:24.923
It's not an option.

15:24.925 --> 15:26.991
Can we try
a high thoracic spinal?

15:26.993 --> 15:29.527
I've done it before.
It means he'll be awake
and aware

15:29.529 --> 15:31.296
Of everything we're doing
during surgery.

15:31.298 --> 15:32.397
So we better talk
the the new chief.

15:40.105 --> 15:41.606
You want to do what?
I want my couch back.
I love that couch.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.042
The other thing.
An awake surgery.

15:44.044 --> 15:46.711
It's experimental.
Dr. Baumann's done it before.

15:46.713 --> 15:50.048
<i>Once.</i> Epidurals on
pregnant women don't count.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.182
How am I supposed to make
an 8-inch incision

15:51.184 --> 15:53.051
In his abdomen,
suck out the aneurysm,

15:53.053 --> 15:56.187
And then sew a gore-tex tube in
without anesthetic?

15:56.189 --> 15:57.956
I would have said "yes"
when I was chief.

15:57.958 --> 16:01.092
Just saying.
Joel, I have been interim
chief of surgery

16:01.094 --> 16:03.027
For exactly two days.

16:03.029 --> 16:04.963
Why don't you lob me
a pitch that I can hit?

16:04.965 --> 16:07.999
You're chief because
you can hit any pitch, dawn.

16:08.001 --> 16:11.069
(siren wailing in distance)

16:14.273 --> 16:15.473
You were never here.

16:19.445 --> 16:23.414
(sighs) so?

16:23.416 --> 16:26.517
I believe that was
a dawn bell "yes."

16:39.566 --> 16:46.137
Hi, I'm dr. Murphy.
Hi. Uh, are you taking me
to the operating room?

16:46.139 --> 16:48.639
Dr. Harris has asked me
to come and have

16:48.641 --> 16:50.441
A quick chat with you
before your operation.

16:50.443 --> 16:53.778
Can I sit down?
You're a psychiatrist.

16:53.780 --> 16:56.080
I am.

16:56.082 --> 16:58.049
You got a form there?

16:58.051 --> 17:00.718
I do, yes. Do you want me
to put it away?
It doesn't matter.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.286
You're still gonna
fill it out and file it

17:02.288 --> 17:04.222
With my commanding officer.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.626
Dr. Harris tells me
that you're worried about

17:08.628 --> 17:11.329
The length of the recovery time
with your spinal surgery?

17:11.331 --> 17:14.065
I'm military.
I want to go back to my job.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.199
Is there something wrong
with that?

17:15.201 --> 17:16.768
Might be useful
to wait a little,

17:16.770 --> 17:18.336
Get well and then go back.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.204
I'm way more useful there
than here.

17:20.206 --> 17:23.307
It says in your chart
that you have

17:23.309 --> 17:26.244
A lot of scars consistent
with penetrating wounds--

17:26.246 --> 17:27.578
Shrapnel?
Listen...

17:27.580 --> 17:30.481
If I tell you about the crap
I've seen in combat,

17:30.483 --> 17:32.083
You'll scribble
"unresolved issues"

17:32.085 --> 17:33.785
On that form you got,
and I won't redeploy ever.

17:33.787 --> 17:35.586
Do you think you have
unresolved issues?

17:35.588 --> 17:38.056
You can't trick me
into talking.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.128
Um... (clears throat)

17:46.198 --> 17:47.799
You've been home
for almost a year?

17:47.801 --> 17:51.836
And you find yourself drawn
to dangerous activities?

17:51.838 --> 17:54.572
Extremes--like skydiving?
Gotta stay alert.

17:54.574 --> 17:58.609
Stay strong.
Gotta stay combat ready.
Okay.

17:58.611 --> 18:02.580
Well, the key to resolving
traumatizing events

18:02.582 --> 18:04.582
Is remembering them
and telling your story

18:04.584 --> 18:07.552
Over and over.
They're better out than in.

18:07.554 --> 18:08.753
If you knew what
my "unresolved issue" was,

18:08.755 --> 18:10.555
You wouldn't ask me
to relive it.

18:15.394 --> 18:18.229
You can see yourself
out now.

18:24.203 --> 18:27.472
(sighs)

18:27.474 --> 18:31.275
If you change your mind,
I'm willing to listen.

18:38.517 --> 18:39.817
Hey.
Hey.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.519
Just spoke
with your patient fran.

18:41.521 --> 18:43.221
And? P.T.S.D.?

18:43.223 --> 18:46.424
Eh, I think she's having trouble
with one specific event,

18:46.426 --> 18:49.360
Something she says is
too painful to talk about.

18:49.362 --> 18:50.628
Yeah, she's a tough cookie.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.597
Until she starts
to externalize

18:52.599 --> 18:54.232
The event that has
traumatized her,

18:54.234 --> 18:56.701
And she's gonna keep
jumping out of planes,

18:56.703 --> 18:57.802
Nearly killing herself.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.571
But what do we do about
her mental state?

19:00.573 --> 19:02.273
Hard to say.

19:02.275 --> 19:05.843
I mean, there's almost always
a key to unlocking a trauma.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.778
Just have to keep listening.

19:09.481 --> 19:10.815
Thanks.

19:13.218 --> 19:16.354
Sorry to bother you
so late at night.

19:16.356 --> 19:18.890
Oh, I'm fine.
I'll be doing rounds all night.

19:18.892 --> 19:21.425
The nursing staff tends to
thin out after midnight.

19:21.427 --> 19:22.560
Can we get the results tonight?

19:22.562 --> 19:24.495
Well, I am the new guy,

19:24.497 --> 19:27.899
To sweet talk to the lab
into putting a rush on it.

19:27.901 --> 19:29.233
Right. Great.

19:29.235 --> 19:30.368
You got it?
Yeah.

19:30.370 --> 19:31.602
(instrument clatters)

19:31.604 --> 19:33.638
Now, maggie,
there's only a 30% chance

19:33.640 --> 19:36.240
That you contracted a virus
from your patient.

19:36.242 --> 19:37.441
Whoo-hoo.

19:37.443 --> 19:40.211
But if you do test positive
for c.M.V.,

19:40.213 --> 19:42.213
There's a chance that
your baby will have--

19:42.215 --> 19:43.347
Hearing and vision loss,
heart failure,

19:43.349 --> 19:45.850
All right, let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.351
But if you do test positive

19:47.353 --> 19:48.886
And we see any of those things
on the ultrasound,

19:48.888 --> 19:51.222
Then we can discuss
the next steps.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.257
Terminating the pregnancy?

19:53.259 --> 19:55.860
That would be part of
the conversation at that time.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.628
But not now, of course.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.864
Of course. Cool.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.265
Cool.

20:03.535 --> 20:05.269
(monitor beeping steadily)
(alex) you feel this?

20:05.271 --> 20:06.404
(seth) don't feel a thing.

20:06.406 --> 20:07.772
How about this?

20:07.774 --> 20:08.940
Nothing.

20:08.942 --> 20:10.274
This?

20:10.276 --> 20:11.676
Ooh, a little to the left.

20:11.678 --> 20:14.212
I just might rub a little ice
on his feet.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.646
Hey. Not really into that.

20:15.648 --> 20:18.916
You don't want to know
what I've heard about <i>you...</i>

20:18.918 --> 20:22.420
Which is nothing, 'cause you're
about to reattach my fingers

20:22.422 --> 20:24.388
And I don't want
to alienate you.

20:25.624 --> 20:28.526
Smart man.

20:28.528 --> 20:29.727
Wow.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.796
You play piano
with these bad boys?

20:31.798 --> 20:35.299
No. But it's really tough
to find hockey gloves that fit.

20:35.301 --> 20:36.467
Have suction ready.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.703
Hey.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.738
Am I really
not gonna feel anything?

20:40.740 --> 20:42.707
If you do, let me know.

20:42.709 --> 20:43.841
Okay?

20:43.843 --> 20:45.843
Okay.

20:45.845 --> 20:48.479
Awake surgery, here we go.

20:48.481 --> 20:50.982
Here we go.

20:50.984 --> 20:52.650
(sighs deeply)

20:52.652 --> 20:54.852
Just let me know
when you start.

20:54.854 --> 20:57.255
I just did.

21:05.397 --> 21:06.797
What are you doing now, alex?

21:06.799 --> 21:10.368
I am getting ready to slice into
your aneurysm, seth.

21:10.370 --> 21:11.769
Cool.

21:11.771 --> 21:15.373
To have your hands inside
some guy's guts, huh?

21:15.375 --> 21:16.807
Yep.

21:16.809 --> 21:17.942
Suction.

21:17.944 --> 21:21.512
(suction gurgling)

21:21.514 --> 21:22.780
Sing it again, victor.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.048
(sighs)

21:24.050 --> 21:26.450
â™ª rink man, rink man

21:26.452 --> 21:27.585
â™ª all you need's a...

21:27.587 --> 21:29.487
(falsetto) â™ª hose

21:29.489 --> 21:30.621
(laughs) he's famous.

21:30.623 --> 21:31.922
Stop. Please.

21:31.924 --> 21:33.891
It's so embarrassing.

21:33.893 --> 21:36.894
The most embarrassing thing
I've ever done,

21:36.896 --> 21:39.830
And I just got my fingers caught
in a condom machine.

21:39.832 --> 21:43.534
I love that jingle.
I sing it in the car every day.

21:43.536 --> 21:46.070
(victor) who actually buys
an ice rink kit?

21:46.072 --> 21:48.005
Parents with kids, mostly.

21:48.007 --> 21:51.342
Yeah. I played a lot of junior b
when I was young.

21:51.344 --> 21:53.711
So... You know.

21:53.713 --> 21:55.413
Gotta do what you love.

21:55.415 --> 21:58.649
Yeah, I've had a lot of offers
to sell,

21:58.651 --> 22:00.685
But I just can't bring myself
to do it.

22:00.687 --> 22:03.621
You'd be a free agent.
I hear the ducks are looking.

22:03.623 --> 22:06.424
Free agency's not for me,

22:06.426 --> 22:07.692
Just so you know.

22:07.694 --> 22:09.927
I'm more of
a one-team kind of guy.

22:09.929 --> 22:12.963
Okay, let's bring the c-arm
in here, please.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.634
(machinery beeps)

22:16.636 --> 22:18.502
Oop.

22:18.504 --> 22:19.637
Stick shot.

22:19.639 --> 22:21.906
(whirs and beeps)

22:21.908 --> 22:23.607
Okay, I'm done
with the k-wire.

22:23.609 --> 22:26.377
Let's get the c-arm out of here,
and I will start the a.V.N.

22:26.379 --> 22:28.479
Can we get the microscope
in here? And some 8.0, please.

22:28.481 --> 22:29.947
Thank you.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.352
Hey, watch your step.
Give me some room.

22:34.354 --> 22:38.089
All right, sorry. Victor,
p.T.F.E. Graft, 3.0 prolene.

22:38.091 --> 22:40.725
I am going to
suture distally first.

22:40.727 --> 22:43.694
Okay, I am getting ready
to put the graft in.

22:43.696 --> 22:44.795
Are you comfortable?

22:44.797 --> 22:46.630
Oh, yeah.

22:49.068 --> 22:53.137
Seth, I'm suturing with a thread
that's finer than human hair.

22:53.139 --> 22:55.406
I can't have any movement,
okay?

22:55.408 --> 22:57.608
Sorry.

22:57.610 --> 23:01.379
It's just that...
Crazy tube thing.

23:01.381 --> 23:02.813
I'm trying to do my best.

23:02.815 --> 23:04.982
I think seth could use
a little more sedation.

23:04.984 --> 23:08.152
It's--it's all just
starting to...

23:08.154 --> 23:10.421
To hit me.
The whole thing, you know?

23:10.423 --> 23:12.089
Seth, you are doing great.

23:12.091 --> 23:13.591
I-I don't really think
I am doing great, guys.

23:13.593 --> 23:15.993
(joel)
just stay with us, rink man.

23:15.995 --> 23:17.862
(inhales deeply)
okay, I'll do my best.

23:17.864 --> 23:20.865
You know, alex reid
was once a cheerleader.

23:20.867 --> 23:24.402
(laughs)
I was <i>not</i> a cheerleader.

23:24.404 --> 23:26.470
You still have your costume?

23:26.472 --> 23:28.472
It's under my scrubs.

23:34.012 --> 23:36.080
Hey. Maggie go home?

23:36.082 --> 23:37.415
No, I don't think so.

23:37.417 --> 23:38.416
She's on call
in the e.R. Tonight.

23:38.418 --> 23:40.017
Is she still
up in obstetrics?

23:40.019 --> 23:41.819
She was in obstetrics?
Yeah, for the blood test.

23:41.821 --> 23:43.621
Can you get her to text me
when you see her?

23:43.623 --> 23:45.823
Okay--
or better yet, just tell her
I need her in the e.R. Stat.

23:45.825 --> 23:46.957
Thank you.

23:46.959 --> 23:48.759
Wait. What blood test?

23:52.197 --> 23:54.732
(suction gurgling)
okay.

23:54.734 --> 23:57.668
Before we put the rod in,
I wanna get a closer look...

23:57.670 --> 23:59.003
At this.

23:59.005 --> 24:02.440
Shahir, what does that
look like to you?

24:02.442 --> 24:04.642
Hmm. Yeah, it doesn't appear
contiguous

24:04.644 --> 24:06.043
With the rest of the spine.

24:06.045 --> 24:09.013
Right, which rules out
an osteosarcoma. Give it a feel.

24:09.015 --> 24:12.183
(machinery beeps)

24:12.185 --> 24:13.784
(squishing)

24:13.786 --> 24:16.520
Well, it's not only soft tissue.
It's ossified, charlie.

24:16.522 --> 24:17.755
It feels a lot like--

24:17.757 --> 24:18.889
Like bone?
Yes, very much,

24:18.891 --> 24:20.191
But it's not part
of the spine.

24:20.193 --> 24:22.226
So who does it belong to?

24:22.228 --> 24:23.961
Well,
that's my question exactly.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.863
Scalpel, please.

24:25.865 --> 24:28.699
It's a real mystery.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.534
<i>Reporting for duty, sir.</i>

24:34.473 --> 24:37.074
(woman) dr. Harris?

24:37.076 --> 24:39.109
Thank you.

24:39.111 --> 24:40.911
Pickups, please.

24:55.060 --> 24:56.694
Let's give it a little wash.

24:56.696 --> 24:57.895
Hmm?

25:04.102 --> 25:05.870
Charlie.

25:05.872 --> 25:08.839
(clink, water splashing)

25:11.810 --> 25:13.244
It's definitely not her bone.

25:13.246 --> 25:15.946
How can you tell
just by looking at it?

25:15.948 --> 25:17.081
<i>My head hurts.</i>

25:17.083 --> 25:19.850
<i>Sir, I don't want</i>
<i>to be discharged, sir.</i>

25:19.852 --> 25:22.987
Oh, although I do enjoy
a bit of game theory.

25:22.989 --> 25:25.089
Uh, loupes, please.

25:25.091 --> 25:27.658
(instrument clatters)

25:28.760 --> 25:30.227
Thank you.

25:36.801 --> 25:39.203
Yeah, it looks like
a small wormian fissure.

25:40.839 --> 25:42.640
Let me see that.

25:43.842 --> 25:46.277
Loupes, please.

25:46.279 --> 25:47.645
Thank you.

25:47.647 --> 25:50.981
Like tectonic plates
that have shifted together

25:50.983 --> 25:52.583
When the fontanel fuses.

25:52.585 --> 25:54.718
You're right, charlie.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.687
This is a piece
of someone else's skull.

25:56.689 --> 26:01.559
<i>Oh, please, sir. Let me stay</i>
<i>with my unit.</i>

26:01.561 --> 26:02.960
<i>Fidus ultra finem.</i>

26:02.962 --> 26:05.195
Shahir, how's your latin?

26:05.197 --> 26:06.330
Excellent.

26:06.332 --> 26:07.965
Wanna bet on it?

26:07.967 --> 26:09.099
Mm... No.

26:09.101 --> 26:10.834
Um...
(machinery beeps)

26:10.836 --> 26:12.269
<i>Fidus ultra finem.</i>

26:12.271 --> 26:14.204
"faithful beyond the end."
why?

26:14.206 --> 26:17.007
Oh, no--no reason.
Just curious.

26:17.009 --> 26:19.743
Mm. Latin was an easy "a" for me
in high school.

26:19.745 --> 26:22.346
<i>I can't leave her.</i>
<i>She needs help.</i>

26:22.348 --> 26:25.215
Shahir, I want to put
the bone back.

26:25.217 --> 26:28.152
Charlie, we <i>just</i> took it out.

26:28.154 --> 26:30.220
No, no. I-I wanna do
an allograft.

26:30.222 --> 26:32.289
We'll mulch the bone and use it
to stabilize the rod

26:32.291 --> 26:33.857
Instead of using bone cement.

26:33.859 --> 26:36.193
I'd much rather graft a piece
of her own bone.

26:36.195 --> 26:37.995
W-why cut her up
more than we have to?

26:37.997 --> 26:40.598
Her own body didn't reject
the skull.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.266
So why should we?

26:42.268 --> 26:44.068
It's highly unorthodox.

26:44.070 --> 26:45.736
It is, but it'll work.

26:46.972 --> 26:48.872
Just trust me.

26:48.874 --> 26:50.074
Start mulching.

26:57.282 --> 27:00.684
(crunching)

27:05.790 --> 27:08.792
(machinery beeps)

27:08.794 --> 27:11.161
(seth) so take me back
even further.

27:11.163 --> 27:12.396
Further than high school?

27:12.398 --> 27:14.999
Yeah. What was alex reid doing
grade 4?

27:15.001 --> 27:17.034
Oh. (chuckles) um...

27:17.036 --> 27:18.802
Oh, playground monitor.

27:18.804 --> 27:20.237
You finked on the bad kids.

27:20.239 --> 27:21.972
Mostly my brothers.

27:21.974 --> 27:24.908
What about you, joel?
Get in on this.

27:24.910 --> 27:26.076
What were you doing?

27:26.078 --> 27:29.113
Um... Grade 4.

27:29.115 --> 27:31.949
Let me think about that.
I was 9 years old.

27:31.951 --> 27:34.918
I was probably writing letters
to my father,

27:34.920 --> 27:39.390
Beseeching him to rescue me
from my mother and her cooking.

27:39.392 --> 27:40.958
Where--where was your father?

27:40.960 --> 27:42.993
He was
cheating on my mother.

27:42.995 --> 27:45.729
So it was just
you and your mother?

27:45.731 --> 27:47.865
Pretty much. Yeah.

27:47.867 --> 27:51.735
<i>But</i> unlike his father,

27:51.737 --> 27:55.406
Joel is one of
the more honorable guys I know.

27:55.408 --> 27:56.874
You come in a close second.

27:56.876 --> 27:59.109
I'm relieved to hear this.

27:59.111 --> 28:00.811
(joel) why are you relieved
to hear this?

28:00.813 --> 28:03.914
Sonja's been through
some big stuff, and...

28:03.916 --> 28:06.116
I think she's trying really hard
to trust you.

28:06.118 --> 28:08.118
Yeah, it seems like it.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.387
Better live up to it.

28:12.391 --> 28:17.261
Guys, I don't know how much more
of this I can take.

28:17.263 --> 28:19.997
Joel, can you, uh...

28:19.999 --> 28:22.433
So, seth, is it true
that you're divorced?

28:22.435 --> 28:24.802
12-year relationship.

28:24.804 --> 28:26.737
She moved on. I didn't.

28:26.739 --> 28:28.005
Sorry, man.
That's pretty harsh.

28:28.007 --> 28:29.039
Almost finished.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.475
But you know what?

28:31.477 --> 28:33.143
Can't look back.

28:34.746 --> 28:36.880
Well, maybe you're right.

28:43.154 --> 28:44.722
What's going on?

28:44.724 --> 28:46.490
Nothing.

28:46.492 --> 28:48.459
Zach said that you were getting
a blood test.

28:48.461 --> 28:50.294
Cytomegalovirus.

28:50.296 --> 28:53.997
Well, why didn't you tell me?
I would've come with you.

28:53.999 --> 28:55.733
Exactly, and worried.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.905
(monitor beeping steadily)

29:01.907 --> 29:04.408
Seth, I am about to
start closing,

29:04.410 --> 29:06.510
And then I am done.

29:06.512 --> 29:08.412
What about you, joel?
Are you almost done?

29:08.414 --> 29:09.780
I'm afraid not.

29:09.782 --> 29:12.750
Said the strings
to the bartender.

29:12.752 --> 29:14.151
(joel and alex laugh)

29:14.153 --> 29:16.754
No. I need at least
another hour, mate.

29:16.756 --> 29:18.889
Guys, I don't like very good.

29:18.891 --> 29:20.090
(machinery beeps)

29:20.092 --> 29:22.025
Uh he's in a-fib.

29:22.027 --> 29:23.293
What?
You've got to be kidding me.

29:23.295 --> 29:26.363
I don't know. Could be
because of his heart murmur.

29:26.365 --> 29:28.198
5 mgs metoprolol. Hurry.
(baumann) I'm on it.

29:29.234 --> 29:33.070
Alex, what's happening?

29:33.072 --> 29:35.506
Seth, tell me the joke.

29:35.508 --> 29:36.840
What joke?

29:36.842 --> 29:38.041
Uh, your string joke.

29:38.043 --> 29:40.377
You said a-a string walks
into a bar,

29:40.379 --> 29:42.045
Says to the bartender...
It was really funny.

29:42.047 --> 29:43.280
Okay.

29:43.282 --> 29:45.082
I can't remember.

29:46.818 --> 29:48.786
(sighs deeply)

29:53.224 --> 29:54.825
Still in a-fib. You gotta
get this under control.

29:54.827 --> 29:56.293
I'm trying.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.427
He's not responding
to the metoprolol.

29:57.429 --> 29:59.163
Like I said,
he's got a heart murmur.

29:59.165 --> 30:01.565
Okay, well, we've gotta be
missing something.

30:01.567 --> 30:03.567
Um...

30:03.569 --> 30:05.269
He's got
weak aortic tissue.

30:05.271 --> 30:10.073
But he has long fingers.
Could it be marfan's?
You know what?

30:10.075 --> 30:11.341
That is completely consistent
with marfan syndrome.

30:11.343 --> 30:13.911
Okay, so let's, uh,
run a blood panel, okay?

30:13.913 --> 30:15.579
Yep.
(machinery beeps)

30:15.581 --> 30:18.081
He's--he's back in sinus rhythm.

30:18.083 --> 30:19.349
That's it, my man.

30:19.351 --> 30:20.484
Good. Seth?

30:20.486 --> 30:24.087
Seth, you're gonna be
just fine.

30:24.089 --> 30:26.323
Okay.

30:26.325 --> 30:27.958
Do you believe in fate?

30:30.028 --> 30:32.462
I believe in getting you out
of this o.R. In one piece.

30:32.464 --> 30:35.833
I believe in that, too.

30:35.835 --> 30:37.067
Big time.

30:38.203 --> 30:39.336
Let's close.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.338
(instrument clicks)

30:46.411 --> 30:47.544
Thought you said jason was

30:47.546 --> 30:50.214
The most attentive ob-gyn
on the ward.

30:50.216 --> 30:53.350
Well, he's delivering babies
and doing other heroic things.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.319
But I'm sure as soon
as he gets the results,

30:55.321 --> 30:59.223
And can you stop calling him
"jason" like that?

30:59.225 --> 31:00.991
That's what you call him.

31:00.993 --> 31:02.492
You jealous?
You want me to be?

31:02.494 --> 31:06.864
Can we just wait for the results
and not get hysterical?

31:09.267 --> 31:12.369
Okay, we're gonna
have to talk,

31:12.371 --> 31:13.503
'cause we can't
get through this

31:13.505 --> 31:15.305
Acting like a couple of
angry strangers.

31:15.307 --> 31:16.573
When I talk, it scares you.

31:16.575 --> 31:17.908
And    <i>th</i>scares <i>you.</i>

31:17.910 --> 31:18.942
Don't shrink me.

31:18.944 --> 31:20.577
Y-- (sighs)

31:20.579 --> 31:23.013
Okay, how about this?

31:23.015 --> 31:24.615
You shrink me.

31:24.617 --> 31:26.884
Give it a shot. Tell me what
you think's wrong with me.

31:26.886 --> 31:28.252
Can of worms, gavin.

31:28.254 --> 31:31.021
Open it, maggie.

31:31.023 --> 31:32.923
It's like you think you deserve
some sort of medal

31:32.925 --> 31:35.225
For being so patient
and understanding

31:35.227 --> 31:36.927
<i>All</i> of the time.

31:36.929 --> 31:38.228
It's like a martyr complex.

31:40.131 --> 31:42.132
My turn.

31:42.134 --> 31:43.433
(exhales deeply)

31:43.435 --> 31:46.169
You think that you're alone
in the world,

31:46.171 --> 31:47.304
And that's actually
really selfish

31:47.306 --> 31:48.672
Because you're not alone.

31:48.674 --> 31:51.074
Um, my father died.

31:51.076 --> 31:54.444
I'm having this baby,
and I don't even have a family.

31:54.446 --> 31:56.113
We...

31:56.115 --> 31:59.249
You are so wrong.

31:59.251 --> 32:01.685
<i>We</i> are a family.

32:01.687 --> 32:03.620
<i>I'm</i> your family, maggie.

32:08.526 --> 32:10.427
Bone?

32:10.429 --> 32:14.298
I know it's a lot
to take in, but, um...

32:14.300 --> 32:18.001
Yeah, we call it, um,
biological shrapnel.

32:18.003 --> 32:20.304
It's not my bone.

32:20.306 --> 32:22.306
No, it's someone else's.

32:22.308 --> 32:24.708
And...

32:24.710 --> 32:26.610
You put it back on my spine?

32:26.612 --> 32:28.078
Not exactly.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.713
We used it to, um...

32:29.715 --> 32:32.349
Strengthen the hardware
affixing your spinal fracture

32:32.351 --> 32:35.452
By turning the bone
into a paste,

32:35.454 --> 32:36.653
Like a cement.

32:39.457 --> 32:42.559
I think I know what it is
you're going through.

32:42.561 --> 32:45.495
(voice breaks) you do, huh?

32:47.231 --> 32:49.566
I think you were in
an explosion,

32:49.568 --> 32:54.304
And a piece of someone's skull
got lodged against your spine.

32:54.306 --> 32:57.341
We all saw people die
over there.

32:57.343 --> 33:00.444
Well, this would've been
a powerful explosion,

33:00.446 --> 33:02.646
An I.E.D. Or--
no.

33:08.052 --> 33:09.453
It wasn't an I.E.D.

33:09.455 --> 33:12.189
<i>She saw my head get blown off.</i>

33:13.324 --> 33:16.760
He was in an s.U.V. With me.

33:16.762 --> 33:19.029
We were boogieing through
kandahar

33:19.031 --> 33:20.497
When a sniper caught us.

33:22.233 --> 33:23.367
<i>Just me.</i>

33:23.369 --> 33:27.170
I wasn't supposed
to be driving.

33:27.172 --> 33:30.374
Mccreary let me.

33:30.376 --> 33:33.710
He was in the passenger seat.

33:33.712 --> 33:37.447
(voice breaks)
should have been me.

33:37.449 --> 33:39.249
(sniffles)

33:39.251 --> 33:42.586
Mccreary...
(inhales deeply)

33:42.588 --> 33:44.588
He was a nice guy.

33:44.590 --> 33:48.492
An awesome soldier.

33:50.294 --> 33:53.130
So how sick is that?

33:53.132 --> 33:56.633
He let me drive, and he...

33:56.635 --> 33:59.136
(crying)

33:59.138 --> 34:01.304
You don't have to hold on
to this guilt forever, fran.

34:01.306 --> 34:04.207
Yeah, I do.

34:04.209 --> 34:06.443
I'm the one responsible.

34:06.445 --> 34:11.181
The least I can do is
hold on to his memory.

34:11.183 --> 34:14.284
It's the least I can do.

34:16.087 --> 34:20.057
You need to start talking
to someone about this.

34:20.059 --> 34:21.324
Someone professional.

34:21.326 --> 34:24.194
(sniffles) it's not just gonna
wipe the slate clean.

34:24.196 --> 34:26.196
I can't just start over.

34:26.198 --> 34:27.397
No, you can't.

34:29.200 --> 34:31.134
You can't start over.

34:33.571 --> 34:36.173
But you can find a better way
to live with this.

34:39.477 --> 34:41.278
You're telling me
I should see a shrink.

34:43.614 --> 34:46.850
Yeah, I'm telling you
you should see a shrink.

34:54.592 --> 34:55.792
At ease?

34:59.130 --> 35:00.597
<i>Yeah.</i>

35:08.207 --> 35:11.241
Probably wasn't gonna pick up
the dinner tab either.

35:11.243 --> 35:13.643
No one can deny, however,
that being prepared

35:13.645 --> 35:15.745
Makes him a responsible
sexual partner.

35:15.747 --> 35:17.681
And it makes him
more presumptuous.

35:17.683 --> 35:20.350
What, sex on the first date?
He was looking for a booty call.

35:20.352 --> 35:22.252
Thank you.

35:22.254 --> 35:25.222
Hey, lady. How's seth?

35:25.224 --> 35:26.890
Well, I repaired
his aneurysm.

35:26.892 --> 35:28.458
He went into a-fib.
I fixed that.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.160
Waiting to see if he has
marfan syndrome.

35:30.162 --> 35:31.361
It would explain a lot.

35:31.363 --> 35:32.729
So you gonna
go out with him again?

35:32.731 --> 35:34.498
(sighs deeply) no.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.666
But I'll have to admit,
he's kinda grown on me.

35:36.668 --> 35:38.268
3:00.

35:38.270 --> 35:40.137
Why are you fish-eyeing me?

35:41.339 --> 35:43.673
Really?
Yeah.

35:45.510 --> 35:46.643
Hi.

35:46.645 --> 35:48.145
Charlie. Hi.

35:48.147 --> 35:49.479
So... (sighs)

35:49.481 --> 35:51.548
You're dating.

35:55.620 --> 35:59.389
If it makes you feel any better,
I didn't know it was a date.

35:59.391 --> 36:00.590
(exhales deeply)

36:00.592 --> 36:03.160
(siren wailing)

36:03.162 --> 36:05.562
It makes feel better.

36:05.564 --> 36:07.297
At this one point,

36:07.299 --> 36:09.733
He said something about being
a one-team guy.

36:09.735 --> 36:12.569
And I thought about...
(chuckles)

36:12.571 --> 36:15.205
Being on his team,
having a couple of kids,

36:15.207 --> 36:17.774
A backyard rink.

36:20.211 --> 36:22.779
You're killin' me.
(laughs)

36:22.781 --> 36:25.215
It didn't work, charlie.

36:25.217 --> 36:26.683
He's not you.

36:28.619 --> 36:31.621
I miss you.
I am not okay without you.

36:33.558 --> 36:34.691
Me, too.

36:34.693 --> 36:37.260
Then why are we doing this?

36:37.262 --> 36:42.832
Because I don't want to drag you
through any more of my crap.

36:45.503 --> 36:49.372
Well, I am not giving up
on us.

36:49.374 --> 36:51.841
We're meant to be together.
I know it.

36:53.578 --> 36:56.646
And...

36:56.648 --> 36:57.981
I think you know it, too.

36:59.617 --> 37:01.551
I do.

37:17.501 --> 37:20.270
(indistinct conversations)

37:24.642 --> 37:26.810
(sighs) okay.
Where's kalfas?

37:26.812 --> 37:27.944
Exam room.

37:27.946 --> 37:30.847
I don't know, but he's been
in there for a while.

37:39.657 --> 37:40.857
Jason?

37:43.728 --> 37:45.895
Oh, hey, beautiful.

37:45.897 --> 37:47.530
(chuckles)

37:47.532 --> 37:48.665
Uh, what time is it?

37:48.667 --> 37:50.700
I've been waiting
for my results.

37:50.702 --> 37:53.770
Results. Right.
(exhales) right.

37:53.772 --> 37:56.306
Did you even take my blood work
down to the lab?

37:56.308 --> 37:58.375
I'm on it.

37:58.377 --> 37:59.576
Are you okay?

37:59.578 --> 38:01.511
Yeah, it's just, um...

38:01.513 --> 38:03.680
You know, late night,
late shift, right?

38:03.682 --> 38:04.881
Just--just resting.

38:04.883 --> 38:06.349
Mm.

38:06.351 --> 38:07.484
Codeine.

38:07.486 --> 38:10.387
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
No, that's just...

38:10.389 --> 38:11.921
Uh...

38:11.923 --> 38:14.958
You know, long night,
long shift.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.493
I just--I was just sleeping.

38:16.495 --> 38:18.795
I'll deliver the blood work
myself.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.497
Yeah, okay.

38:20.499 --> 38:21.631
Great.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.800
Thanks.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.001
(clears throat) mm.

38:25.003 --> 38:27.437
(grunts)

38:27.439 --> 38:28.972
(exhales deeply)

38:28.974 --> 38:31.675
(monitor beeping steadily)

38:31.677 --> 38:32.976
Those fingers are
pinking up nicely,

38:32.978 --> 38:35.445
Which should make you happy.

38:35.447 --> 38:37.647
(chuckles) it does.

38:38.849 --> 38:41.318
So you and alex
used to date?

38:41.320 --> 38:42.452
A long time ago, I did.

38:42.454 --> 38:43.586
Yeah.

38:43.588 --> 38:46.056
Does sonja know about that?

38:46.058 --> 38:48.391
Yeah, that's actually why

38:48.393 --> 38:50.393
I asked alex to join us
for dinner.

38:50.395 --> 38:53.530
Oh. To prove to her that
you and alex were done?

38:53.532 --> 38:54.664
Kind of an issue there, yes.

38:54.666 --> 38:57.000
And then sonja invited me
so that alex--

38:57.002 --> 38:58.802
Yes. Exactly, seth.

38:58.804 --> 39:00.804
Oh, it was a very complicated
dinner.

39:00.806 --> 39:02.605
Yes, but you still have
all your fingers.

39:02.607 --> 39:03.740
True.
Mm-hmm.

39:03.742 --> 39:04.874
(knock on door)

39:04.876 --> 39:06.343
(joel and seth) hey.

39:06.345 --> 39:09.045
Hi. So your blood work
came back.

39:09.047 --> 39:11.948
You have a condition called
marfan syndrome.

39:11.950 --> 39:13.616
Awesome. More bad luck.

39:13.618 --> 39:16.486
No, actually, it's proof that
you're not unlucky.

39:16.488 --> 39:18.621
You have a connective tissue
problem, seth.

39:18.623 --> 39:21.524
But with regular monitoring, it
will be completely manageable.

39:21.526 --> 39:24.461
Put that on my dating profile.

39:24.463 --> 39:28.098
Bad heart. Tubed aorta.
Where's the plus?

39:28.100 --> 39:29.532
You have big hands
and big feet.

39:29.534 --> 39:30.867
You can put that
on your profile.

39:30.869 --> 39:32.001
Ooh.

39:32.003 --> 39:33.403
(knock on door)
(sonja) hey!

39:33.405 --> 39:35.572
Hello.
(singsongy) I brought breakfast!

39:35.574 --> 39:37.607
Which you probably can't eat.

39:37.609 --> 39:38.742
<i>I</i> probably can.

39:38.744 --> 39:39.876
Well, it's just bagels, babe.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.878
Yeah, that sounds
kind of perfect.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.012
(whispers) okay.

39:43.014 --> 39:46.416
Uh, kyle--he made you a card.

39:46.418 --> 39:48.985
Oh, sweet.
It's rink man!

39:48.987 --> 39:52.689
Yeah. It's gonna be a tough time
living this one down, huh?

39:52.691 --> 39:53.823
Man, everybody's seen
that commercial but me.

39:53.825 --> 39:55.658
What?
(joel) honestly?

39:55.660 --> 39:56.793
Oh, come on.

39:56.795 --> 39:57.927
â™ª rink man, rink man

39:57.929 --> 39:59.162
â™ª all you need is a...

39:59.164 --> 40:00.497
â™ª hose
â™ª hose

40:00.499 --> 40:01.965
God, I wish I had a jingle.

40:01.967 --> 40:04.467
Oh, I-I-I could write you one.

40:04.469 --> 40:05.702
Really?
Yeah. Yeah.

40:05.704 --> 40:07.871
Awesome.
Um...

40:07.873 --> 40:09.939
â™ª bone man, bone man

40:09.941 --> 40:13.076
â™ª all you need is a...

40:13.078 --> 40:15.044
â™ª osteotome

40:15.046 --> 40:17.547
Or just a drill, joel.
Just a drill.
Okay.

40:17.549 --> 40:20.784
Oh! Um, are you sure you don't
wanna just stay for a bagel?

40:20.786 --> 40:22.585
No, really, I-I can't.

40:22.587 --> 40:26.189
I-I mean, I'm just saying that
the rink business

40:26.191 --> 40:28.658
Is <i>very</i> lucrative.

40:28.660 --> 40:30.794
Why don't we quit
while we're behind?

40:30.796 --> 40:32.462
And just, uh...
Mm.

40:32.464 --> 40:33.730
(mutters) I understand.
Just...

40:33.732 --> 40:34.931
It was nice to meet you,
alex.

40:34.933 --> 40:36.800
Nice to meet you, too,
and good luck.

40:36.802 --> 40:38.768
Good luck.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.670
That was supposed to be
a peace sign.

40:40.672 --> 40:42.105
I'm not flipping you
the bird.

40:42.107 --> 40:43.139
(chuckles)

40:43.141 --> 40:45.708
Bye.

40:45.710 --> 40:48.678
Wow.
Wow.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.547
Do you want to try
some of this?

40:50.549 --> 40:51.948
(apparat's "a violent sky"
playing)

40:51.950 --> 40:56.085
â™ª I've seen you on the road

40:56.087 --> 40:58.788
(speaking inaudibly)

40:58.790 --> 41:03.760
â™ª I've seen you on the road

41:06.096 --> 41:10.633
â™ª the place
they called it home â™ª

41:41.666 --> 41:43.199
Hey.

41:43.201 --> 41:45.134
Hey.

41:45.136 --> 41:46.536
You, uh, you headin' home?

41:46.538 --> 41:48.104
Yeah. End of my shift.

41:48.106 --> 41:50.974
I need your help.

41:50.976 --> 41:52.675
Again.

41:52.677 --> 41:55.979
You know, I think I might've
just rounded a corner with her.

41:55.981 --> 41:58.815

42:03.621 --> 42:05.955
Or... Another patient?

42:09.660 --> 42:11.127
Um...

42:13.564 --> 42:16.165
I, uh...

42:16.167 --> 42:19.836
Made a medical decision today
based on a hunch I had.

42:19.838 --> 42:23.640
Surgeons make calls like that
all the time.

42:25.309 --> 42:27.076
I'm not being clear.

42:27.078 --> 42:28.311
Y--okay. Sorry.

42:28.313 --> 42:30.213
I'll let you explain.

42:34.785 --> 42:38.821
I let a ghost convince me
how to treat my patient.

42:43.227 --> 42:45.261
You let a...

42:45.263 --> 42:47.263
A...

42:50.301 --> 42:51.701
Yeah.
