07:35.658 --> 07:36.726
You shot in the air.

07:37.961 --> 07:40.196

You hear me?

07:56.046 --> 07:57.948

08:01.085 --> 08:02.686
Yeah. Okay.

08:14.032 --> 08:16.332
- Hey, Meg.
- Hey, do I need to remind you

08:16.334 --> 08:18.267
- about tomorrow?
- No, I'm not gonna forget

08:18.269 --> 08:19.802
Darcy's recital again.

08:19.804 --> 08:21.671
I'm getting to this place
where I really feel

08:21.673 --> 08:23.241
like the influence
that you have over her,

08:23.608 --> 08:25.143
would help, a lot.

08:25.777 --> 08:27.579
<i>I'm not gonna let her down.</i>

08:28.613 --> 08:29.781
Just tell her I'll be there.

08:30.782 --> 08:31.683
We good?

08:32.217 --> 08:33.152
<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>Sure, we are.</i>

08:49.969 --> 08:51.737
- Kelly?
- Hey.

08:57.911 --> 08:58.812
Blaine.

08:59.346 --> 09:00.247
Where is he?

09:03.884 --> 09:04.918
Kelly, where is he?

09:23.371 --> 09:24.772
What a surprise!

09:25.273 --> 09:27.373
- In the mood, Sonny?
- Come on down, Blaine.

09:27.375 --> 09:28.843
Let me talk to you a second.

09:29.944 --> 09:31.243
I know you wanna search
my house,

09:31.245 --> 09:33.215
you won't find nothing.
You never have.

09:34.849 --> 09:35.750
Hmm.

09:36.617 --> 09:38.719
No, Blaine,
I ain't here to search shit.

09:39.054 --> 09:40.255
What you doing here?

09:42.357 --> 09:44.259
You feel good hitting girls,
Blaine?

09:44.827 --> 09:46.962
- That's property.
- Mm.

09:47.329 --> 09:49.231
Sometimes a man gotta make
property behave.

09:50.999 --> 09:52.935
Now you my property.
You like that?

09:53.269 --> 09:55.838
You ain't nothing but a hoe
out here, we know what's up.

09:56.672 --> 09:58.341
Put that shit aside, cop.

09:59.275 --> 10:01.344
Y'all see this? You see this?

10:01.643 --> 10:04.114
I'm making money as we speak
'cause that's my lawyer.

10:05.181 --> 10:06.848
Let's see who's who
and what's what

10:06.850 --> 10:08.084
like we did back in the day.

10:08.318 --> 10:10.320
Detective, Detective!

10:11.455 --> 10:12.887
Come on, now.

10:12.889 --> 10:14.291
No, stop it!

10:17.228 --> 10:18.362
Come on, no!

10:58.371 --> 11:00.105
<i>Finally getting out,
huh, Banning?</i>

11:00.306 --> 11:01.440
<i>What you gonna do now?</i>

11:05.777 --> 11:06.879
I'll make a difference.

11:35.976 --> 11:37.744
Hmm, damn, I got choices.

11:39.980 --> 11:41.547
Your boy didn't tell us
he was coming, Jake.

11:41.549 --> 11:44.015
Come on, Andy.
I called him, offered a ride,

11:44.017 --> 11:45.384
told him he could come
with me, all that.

11:45.386 --> 11:46.853
You knew your brothers
were coming?

11:48.556 --> 11:51.092
- Yeah.
- Why didn't you tell me?

11:52.293 --> 11:53.361
I guess I forgot.

11:55.396 --> 11:56.364
Okay, okay.

11:58.933 --> 12:00.268
Okay, hold on, hold on.

12:03.271 --> 12:05.773
Hey, C.O.,

12:09.877 --> 12:10.980
Give me the keys, man.

12:11.547 --> 12:12.481
Hey!

12:13.182 --> 12:14.316

12:15.317 --> 12:16.819

Okay, hold on, honey.
Let me see here.

12:32.202 --> 12:33.470
All right, done.

12:37.140 --> 12:38.041
Hey yo!

12:39.476 --> 12:40.844
Hey, Donna.

12:41.378 --> 12:42.611
Babe, take this.

12:42.613 --> 12:44.281
Let me talk to Sonny,
All right, babe?

12:47.451 --> 12:49.553
- Sonny boy. What's up?
- What's up?

12:49.886 --> 12:51.555
He told you he was getting out
today, huh?

12:51.756 --> 12:53.389
- Mm-hmm.
- Just get Kayvon

12:53.391 --> 12:55.891
- and meet us up there.
- You gotta give it all to him?

12:55.893 --> 12:56.894
Every dime.

12:59.096 --> 13:02.166
But only 'cause
you say so.

13:03.034 --> 13:04.035
No other reason.

13:33.999 --> 13:36.469
- What's up, Andy?
- Welcome back Sonny boy.

13:36.868 --> 13:37.970
I ain't no boy.

13:40.640 --> 13:41.841
I'm gonna call you back.

13:43.476 --> 13:46.580
I told you. When they started
sending 'em across the river,

13:47.447 --> 13:48.948
ruining our schools,

13:49.349 --> 13:51.050
that gonna be your downfall.

13:52.319 --> 13:53.920
Claire, you can't hate me
forever.

13:54.521 --> 13:56.490
True, you'll be dead one day.

13:58.425 --> 14:00.127
Good to see you, Claire.

14:00.728 --> 14:03.130
- She loves you, fool.
- I love her too.

14:04.131 --> 14:05.265
Welcome home, Jake!

14:05.899 --> 14:08.135
Hey, you mad my brothers came
and I didn't tell you?

14:09.436 --> 14:12.440
No. I thought,
we passed payback though.

14:12.906 --> 14:14.108
What, are you crazy?

14:14.609 --> 14:16.143
We're just getting started baby.

14:18.313 --> 14:19.547
Hey, you and Megan done?

14:19.947 --> 14:23.418
- Hmm. Separated.
- Separated?

14:24.018 --> 14:24.919
Yeah.

14:25.687 --> 14:28.588
- I screwed that up, big time.
- Megan's little sister Darcy

14:28.590 --> 14:30.691
- part of that mix?
- Darcy's a good kid.

14:30.693 --> 14:33.159
We took her in
after Meg's parents passed.

14:33.161 --> 14:35.096
And it worked, the three of us,
for a minute.

14:37.733 --> 14:40.269
- That's all on me.
- I respect that, man.

14:40.770 --> 14:42.937
I do. I get it.
I'm not judging you.

14:43.172 --> 14:46.640
I... You don't really know
what a relationship is like

14:46.642 --> 14:48.144
until you're in one, am I right?

14:50.045 --> 14:52.248
I had a couple guys
washing my drawers,

14:52.582 --> 14:54.083
they pulled out.

14:55.117 --> 14:56.553
You crazy, boy.

14:57.354 --> 14:59.587
You tell your mama, boy?
Hey Claire...

14:59.589 --> 15:01.425
Stop playing, man,
you're gonna get us killed.

15:03.160 --> 15:04.461
Where the rest of them boys at?

15:06.463 --> 15:08.465
- Waitin' on their brother, man.
- Okay.

15:10.701 --> 15:12.567
Well, let's giddy up, then.

15:27.318 --> 15:30.087
- Demons, what up?
- What's up... What's up, Jake?

15:30.588 --> 15:32.457
I see age don't favor everybody.

15:32.657 --> 15:35.493
Fuck you, man.
How's the fresh air?

15:35.761 --> 15:38.129

15:47.039 --> 15:49.041
Counting push-ups.
I ain't counting days.

15:49.475 --> 15:51.241
Was some aerobics type shit.

15:51.243 --> 15:53.410
Nobody do aerobics no more, man.

15:53.412 --> 15:55.581
Yeah, they spin.
Spinnin's in. I spin.

15:55.849 --> 15:57.182
Yeah, you look like it too.

15:57.717 --> 15:59.717

15:59.719 --> 16:01.086

16:08.328 --> 16:10.661
Seeing you would've been
too painful, dawg.

16:10.663 --> 16:13.698
Sonny saw me.
I didn't even wanna see his ass.

16:13.700 --> 16:15.600
- He's a cop.
- Yeah, but that's not fair.

16:15.602 --> 16:17.636
See, Sonny always doing shit
that don't nobody else do...

16:17.638 --> 16:19.538
- Shut the fuck up, okay?
- No, listen. You're right, man.

16:19.540 --> 16:21.207
- We should've came to see you.
- Enough.

16:21.775 --> 16:23.142
That's not why we're here.

16:24.845 --> 16:26.045
Y'all follow me.

16:45.266 --> 16:46.166
Hey man.

16:46.835 --> 16:48.470
It's all there,
not a penny touched.

16:48.703 --> 16:50.505
This motherfucker
made sure of it.

16:51.640 --> 16:54.442
Hmm, don't look like three mil.

16:56.478 --> 16:57.579
My share ain't there, yet.

16:59.514 --> 17:01.216
I couldn't tell you
while you were inside.

17:02.552 --> 17:05.285
- He's smart for a cop, huh?
- Yeah, Officer Genius

17:05.287 --> 17:07.454
right here. Hid it in his house
while he was renovating.

17:07.455 --> 17:09.155
Megan didn't even know
it was in there.

17:09.156 --> 17:10.758
Look Jake,
trust this is hard enough

17:10.760 --> 17:12.526
saving all this shit
for you, bro.

17:12.528 --> 17:14.461
We got kids, bills,
all type of shit.

17:14.463 --> 17:16.163
You want me to get you a tissue?

17:16.165 --> 17:18.334
Listen, Jake did the time.
He get to choose.

17:19.734 --> 17:22.871
Everybody did the job.
Y'all want your piece,

17:22.873 --> 17:23.807
you can take it.

17:28.478 --> 17:29.446
Hold up.

17:31.815 --> 17:33.150
You sure about that?

17:34.284 --> 17:35.252
Yeah, man.

17:35.886 --> 17:36.853
Go ahead.

17:42.159 --> 17:44.259
Hey, my brothers were gonna
skin you alive

17:44.261 --> 17:45.195
for what happened.

17:46.496 --> 17:47.599
I told them not to.

17:49.467 --> 17:51.101
- 'Cause we homies?
- Nah.

17:51.636 --> 17:53.271
It's not 'cause we're homies.

17:54.772 --> 17:57.275
'Cause if they did, I wouldn't
know where you put the money.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.817
I'm just fucking with you, Joe.

18:05.017 --> 18:06.484
Yo, man!

18:08.453 --> 18:10.454
- That shit ain't funny.
- Fuckin' man.

18:10.456 --> 18:11.955
- It's been long, man.
- Nah, man!

18:11.957 --> 18:13.325
Just get the fuck outta here.

18:13.592 --> 18:14.526
The fuck outta here.

18:15.193 --> 18:17.563
Hey, y'all,
give us two seconds, bro.

18:17.963 --> 18:19.164
'Sup man?

18:19.665 --> 18:21.233
I want you to keep my share.

18:21.533 --> 18:23.968
Let me get it in 'bout a week
or so when Meg's gone...

18:23.970 --> 18:26.503
Hey, everybody did the job,
everybody gets a cut, man.

18:26.505 --> 18:29.339
- I want you to keep mine, Jake.
- Why? Because you're a cop?

18:29.341 --> 18:30.309
No.

18:32.846 --> 18:33.747
I owe you.

18:34.848 --> 18:36.181
That's why, I owe you.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.587
If that's what you want, man.

18:42.322 --> 18:43.356
That's what I want.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.759
- Y'all finished?
- Yeah, we all done here.

18:46.861 --> 18:48.628
Y'all spend that
like a gentleman now.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.797
- In a gentleman's club?
- Imma holler at y'all.

18:51.799 --> 18:53.166
- Later.
- All right, man.

18:59.006 --> 19:01.609
Man, I ain't had a beer
like this in 15 years.

19:03.511 --> 19:05.646
I missed beer.
But you know what I missed more?

19:05.846 --> 19:06.980
- What's that?
- I miss me

19:06.982 --> 19:09.583
some big ol' fat titties.

19:09.918 --> 19:14.554
- Brown titties, black titties.
- Pink titties, Asian titties.

19:14.556 --> 19:16.723
Any titties, wrinkled titties.
No titties...

19:16.725 --> 19:17.857
With no nipple titties.

19:17.859 --> 19:19.327
You always take it too far, bro.

19:20.262 --> 19:21.663
I also miss that K-Mart.

19:22.831 --> 19:24.831
You miss K-Mart?
K-Mart ain't even there.

19:24.833 --> 19:27.602
- It's been closed for years.
- Where you get the guns at?

19:28.804 --> 19:31.473
- Right here.
- Oh, shit.

19:33.375 --> 19:35.945
- I want a firecracker like that!
- Oh, stay strapped.

19:36.612 --> 19:38.581
Hey man, what are you doing
in the morning?

19:39.015 --> 19:40.550
Darcy got a recital.

19:42.719 --> 19:43.951
- A recital.
- Yeah.

19:43.953 --> 19:45.221
I'll come along.

19:45.688 --> 19:47.924
Come along.
See if Darcy takes to a bad boy.

19:48.491 --> 19:52.495
She's 17!
You can take your head off, boy!

19:53.596 --> 19:54.665
You can come though.

19:55.699 --> 19:57.300
She sing, play the piano.

19:58.135 --> 20:00.303
I appreciate everything
you've been doing, man.

20:01.538 --> 20:03.407
You know, making things right.

20:04.641 --> 20:05.676
Go a long way.

20:06.510 --> 20:07.411
No doubt.

20:07.711 --> 20:09.413
You happy to see me
out or what?

20:09.981 --> 20:11.448
Am I happy to see you out?

20:12.851 --> 20:14.518
Shit was eating at me, bro.

20:15.754 --> 20:16.821
Fifteen years.

20:17.589 --> 20:18.489
Yeah.

20:19.124 --> 20:20.525
I'm happy to see you out.

20:21.659 --> 20:22.359
Yeah, man.

20:22.660 --> 20:25.597
I just wanna move on.
Maybe South America.

20:25.864 --> 20:27.665
I was thinking South America.

20:28.500 --> 20:30.935
You wanna to go South America?
That sounds like a good idea.

20:31.203 --> 20:32.905
Yeah, you could use
a change too.

20:34.539 --> 20:38.576
Hey, you and me. All this cash.
Live like kings, bro.

20:39.945 --> 20:41.580
You're getting
into some serious shit.

20:41.847 --> 20:44.282
I'm serious. I got plans,
you're a part of 'em.

20:48.487 --> 20:49.789
I'm good where I am, Jake.

20:56.362 --> 20:58.631
You put a good face
on everything, Sonny.

20:59.966 --> 21:01.333
Joe, Kayvon...

21:01.935 --> 21:04.435
they wouldn't give me this cash
if you ain't tell 'em to.

21:04.437 --> 21:06.504
- I never saw it like that.
- What would you see it like?

21:06.506 --> 21:08.074
I see it like I left
a friend behind.

21:13.580 --> 21:15.917
- You're more than a friend.
- That's right.

21:17.517 --> 21:18.585
Brothers.

21:19.553 --> 21:20.487
Brothers.

21:23.057 --> 21:23.991
All right, man.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.060
I'll catch you tomorrow.

21:28.629 --> 21:30.364

You know, like we used to.

22:22.485 --> 22:23.386
I got plans.

22:24.520 --> 22:28.058
Well, your plans just changed.
We're having a family dinner.

22:29.827 --> 22:32.563
We're not a family
and I am not your kid.

22:39.970 --> 22:40.871
My man.

22:41.505 --> 22:42.806
Good morning, Mr. Banning.

22:43.375 --> 22:46.811
- Huh?
- You looking nice. Real spiffy.

22:49.915 --> 22:52.484
- Jacket was my Daddy's.
- Yeah?

22:52.951 --> 22:53.985
Yeah.

22:55.921 --> 22:57.820
You look respectable,
I appreciate.

22:57.822 --> 22:58.723
Yeah.

23:00.759 --> 23:01.726
What?

23:03.095 --> 23:05.695
Fuck. Fifteen years behind
the wall, not a scratch

23:05.697 --> 23:06.966
and I can't even shave my face.

23:07.465 --> 23:10.102
Yeah, I still see you wearing
that band of eternal bondage.

23:10.937 --> 23:13.505
Yeah, a little wishful thinking,
I guess.

23:13.773 --> 23:15.007
Megan don't wear one, right?

23:16.642 --> 23:19.810
Hey, help is on the way, bro.
Doctor Banning got this.

23:19.812 --> 23:22.682
I'm gonna fix that relationship
up between you and Megan.

23:22.982 --> 23:25.751
I can. Deep down I can tell
you really loved the bitch.

23:26.552 --> 23:29.520
- Bitch? Who you calling a bitch?
- Slut? Cunt? Whore?

23:29.522 --> 23:31.655
Fuck you! You can't call
my wife a bitch,

23:31.657 --> 23:34.092
I will whip your ass if you talk
about Megan like that.

23:34.094 --> 23:35.527
I'm sorry, bitch.
I got carried away.

23:35.529 --> 23:36.496
Oh, I'm a bitch?

23:37.030 --> 23:38.031
I'm a bitch?

23:39.232 --> 23:40.133
Okay, bitch.

23:51.179 --> 23:53.147
Shit. There we go.

23:53.715 --> 23:56.215
Yeah, we had that down.
In and out.

23:56.217 --> 23:59.285
- You did the d, e, m.
- You did the o and n.

23:59.287 --> 24:00.686
That's right.

24:00.688 --> 24:02.188
You had a real talent, man.

24:02.190 --> 24:03.956
You could've done something
with that.

24:03.958 --> 24:06.694
You stuck out here,
chasing bad guys around.

24:09.831 --> 24:12.734
Best time of my life.
It ain't saying much, is it?

24:13.902 --> 24:14.903
That can change.

24:15.804 --> 24:18.173
Like you? Police officer.

24:20.709 --> 24:22.911
- I surprised myself, honestly.
- I get it.

24:24.079 --> 24:25.214
I do, I get it.

24:25.514 --> 24:27.748
All that guilt and shit
have you doing shit

24:27.750 --> 24:30.086
you're not supposed to be doing,
being somebody you're not.

24:30.619 --> 24:34.623
- I'm Catholic, I get it.
- No, that's not why I did it.

24:34.991 --> 24:37.526
- Like not at all why I did it.
- Why you did it, man?

24:38.161 --> 24:39.796
It was the right thing to do.

24:54.778 --> 24:56.113
You forgot something important.

24:59.183 --> 25:00.918
- Forgot what?
- Flowers.

25:02.119 --> 25:04.353
She's gonna finish playing,
she's gonna go,

25:04.355 --> 25:07.892
"Sonny, I love you, Sonny."

25:08.893 --> 25:11.729
- She's gonna appreciate it, man.
- She doesn't like flowers.

25:11.962 --> 25:14.099
We're gotta rush though, man.
I can't be here forever.

25:14.332 --> 25:15.633
Hit the gas.

25:24.810 --> 25:27.012
Hey, you remember when we say,
"We go straight to hell"?

25:27.245 --> 25:28.146
You say what?

25:29.081 --> 25:30.283
I say, "When do we leave".

25:30.615 --> 25:33.685
- I went there, Sonny.
- Yeah, you made it out.

25:34.019 --> 25:35.587
Put the past in the past.

25:36.355 --> 25:37.323
Woo!

25:40.493 --> 25:42.061
Yeah, get some roses.

25:42.395 --> 25:44.328
Closed buds, Sonny. Closed buds.

25:44.330 --> 25:46.297
Some red ones.
You do it, you do it right.

25:46.299 --> 25:48.034
You know what I mean?
Show her you care.

25:48.469 --> 25:50.002
- I'll get some beer.
- All right.

Go someplace.

I don't even need to know.
I will call you.

28:33.374 --> 28:34.973
I... I don't understand.

28:34.975 --> 28:36.475
You're in danger,
Darcy is in danger.

28:38.178 --> 28:39.480

28:39.681 --> 28:41.282

is on the scene.

28:56.197 --> 28:58.133
Are you okay, Sonny? Jesus.

28:58.433 --> 29:00.268
Will you tell me
what happened here, Detective?

29:01.469 --> 29:03.102
Not sure myself, Lieutenant.

29:03.104 --> 29:04.904
But you and the suspect
were here together.

29:04.906 --> 29:06.473
- We got that right?
- That's correct.

29:06.475 --> 29:08.444
- His name is Jake Banning.
- Banning?

29:08.778 --> 29:11.347
Juvie that did time
for that armored car heist.

29:11.781 --> 29:13.983
What the fuck were you doing
with Jake Banning?

29:15.651 --> 29:17.117
I know him from school.

29:17.119 --> 29:19.021
He asked for a ride,
I gave it to him.

29:23.192 --> 29:24.327
Then, he just snapped.

29:34.471 --> 29:36.606
Hey. Darcy, right?

29:37.474 --> 29:40.110
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to creep up on you like that.

29:41.578 --> 29:44.414
- You are?
- Jake. Friend of Sonny's.

29:46.350 --> 29:48.185
Oh. That Jake.

29:49.319 --> 29:50.521
Guilty.

29:51.389 --> 29:53.456
Sonny and me, we were gonna
see you play,

29:53.458 --> 29:54.991
but he got caught up
with something.

29:55.293 --> 29:56.227
Oh, really?

29:56.694 --> 29:58.029
Same old story.

29:58.396 --> 30:00.865
He said you grew up
to be a pretty good kid.

30:01.232 --> 30:03.000
He didn't emphasize
the pretty part.

30:04.035 --> 30:05.236
You're such a liar.

30:05.704 --> 30:08.072
Sonny probably said
I was growing up too fast.

30:08.707 --> 30:11.073
He can be such an ass.
Probably why he didn't come.

30:11.075 --> 30:13.412
Nah, trust me.
He got caught up with work.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.412
So, now you're sticking out
for him?

30:15.414 --> 30:16.948
He really wanted to see you
play.

30:17.182 --> 30:18.117
Look.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.052
Sonny wanted me
to give you this.

30:20.619 --> 30:22.287
He didn't have time to wrap it.

30:25.124 --> 30:26.158
Here.

30:27.059 --> 30:29.562
Look at that.
You know, it looks good on you.

30:30.396 --> 30:31.598
You look like a hot nun.

30:31.865 --> 30:34.300
With that little old dress
cut so spare.

30:35.468 --> 30:36.403
A nun?

30:37.035 --> 30:38.505
- Yeah.
- You don't know me.

30:38.805 --> 30:40.640
That could change. Right?

30:42.442 --> 30:43.676
You've been in prison, right?

30:44.477 --> 30:46.644
Yes, but you know,
I made a little mistake

30:46.646 --> 30:49.215
- when I was about your age.
- What kind of mistake?

30:49.784 --> 30:51.552
I thought I had friends
I could rely on.

30:53.019 --> 30:54.520
You're different from Sonny.

30:54.522 --> 30:56.122
I don't see you two
being friends.

30:56.757 --> 30:58.692
Uh, maybe you don't know him
like I do.

31:02.763 --> 31:03.964
Maybe not.

31:14.776 --> 31:16.776
Hey Kayvon, it's Sonny.
I'm at Joe's house.

31:16.778 --> 31:18.413
Jake maybe coming for you,
call me back.

31:27.355 --> 31:28.256
Yo!

31:30.091 --> 31:31.026
Joe!

31:33.495 --> 31:34.996
Hey, yo Joe! Donna!

31:57.554 --> 32:00.189
Darcy! Where the hell
have you been?

32:00.524 --> 32:02.124
- Nowhere.
- Well, we need to go. Come on.

32:33.124 --> 32:34.125
Fuck, Joe.

32:52.478 --> 32:54.444
<i>What the fuck
is going on, Sonny?</i>

32:54.446 --> 32:55.880
Getman is all over my ass.

32:55.882 --> 32:57.347
He wants to know
if there a connection

32:57.349 --> 32:58.150
between you and Banning.

32:58.450 --> 33:00.752
Joe Williams is dead.
I need... Uh, as many units

33:00.754 --> 33:02.754
as I possibly can get
to Kayvon's house.

33:02.756 --> 33:04.123
I need your help, partner.

33:04.858 --> 33:06.258
How much do I wanna know?

33:08.395 --> 33:09.494
It's bad for me, Lorna.

33:09.496 --> 33:11.195
It's way worse
than any of the shit

33:11.197 --> 33:13.331
- we've ever been through before.
- <i>Shit.</i>

33:13.333 --> 33:16.236
- What the fuck do I tell Getman?
- I don't care what you tell him.

33:16.436 --> 33:18.305
- You'll figure it out.
- <i>You owe me.</i>

33:18.806 --> 33:20.173
Add it to my bill.

33:27.582 --> 33:29.548
<i>River Park
is where we used to meet up</i>

33:29.550 --> 33:31.385
<i>and lay low
after shit popped off.</i>

33:31.886 --> 33:33.487
<i>Hardly anybody was ever there.</i>

33:36.390 --> 33:38.593
<i>Jake said he was just getting
started with his payback.</i>

33:39.660 --> 33:42.296
<i>That's all demons do,
destroy everything you love.</i>

33:46.367 --> 33:47.335
<i>I had to finish this.</i>

33:49.838 --> 33:51.205
How's your day going, Officer?

33:51.707 --> 33:53.475
Wee!

33:54.476 --> 33:56.378
Hey now, still warm.

33:56.845 --> 33:58.213
Hold on tight.

33:58.614 --> 34:02.752
Sonny, unbelievable.
Look at mama, just textin' away.

34:02.986 --> 34:05.385
Paying no mind to her baby girl.

34:05.387 --> 34:07.757
What's this world coming to?

34:08.024 --> 34:09.759
Hey, you remember the first time
we met?

34:10.225 --> 34:13.161
About hour off that bus,
you tried to rob my white ass.

34:13.563 --> 34:15.297
We beat each other
for about an hour.

34:16.232 --> 34:17.600
Both got suspended.

34:18.635 --> 34:19.634
First...

34:19.636 --> 34:20.701
- Second grade.
- Second grade,

34:20.703 --> 34:23.639
you remember. That was a start
of something epic.

34:25.274 --> 34:26.574
Something we always had,

34:26.576 --> 34:28.242
- respect.
- Yeah, we had that.

34:28.244 --> 34:30.279
Yeah, well, you hurt
my feelings, bro.

34:30.581 --> 34:32.583
- Becoming a cop.
- I just found Joe.

34:32.783 --> 34:34.416
Yeah, 15 years inside.

34:34.418 --> 34:35.886
It's funny what you're capable
of doing.

34:36.186 --> 34:38.856
You know I always thought
that there was a code, honor,

34:39.356 --> 34:41.358
friendship, something?

34:42.592 --> 34:44.395
But I had what you call...

34:45.362 --> 34:46.362
an epiphany.

34:46.664 --> 34:49.264
- What was that?
- No such thing as code, honor

34:49.266 --> 34:51.402
- or friendship.
- So, this is your plan?

34:51.603 --> 34:52.504
Yeah...

34:53.538 --> 34:54.672
I'm just wingin' it.

34:55.540 --> 35:01.511
After 15 years, of being told
what to do, when to pee,

35:01.513 --> 35:05.483
when to poop. My brother,
it feels invigorating.

35:06.751 --> 35:07.719
Hey, now!

35:08.386 --> 35:09.554
Uh-oh.

35:10.422 --> 35:13.356
You know what? The cashier
and that lady at the store...

35:13.358 --> 35:14.558
- You didn't have to do that.
- I want you to know

35:14.560 --> 35:16.194
what it feels like to be me.

35:16.395 --> 35:17.930
What it's like
to be fucking helpless.

35:19.732 --> 35:20.733
I've paid the price.

35:22.768 --> 35:23.736
Now you're gonna pay.

35:24.537 --> 35:25.972
You could've killed us
last night.

35:26.238 --> 35:27.941
Yeah, what fun
would that be now, huh?

35:28.474 --> 35:30.609
You know, we're having fun now,
brother.

35:30.977 --> 35:32.944
Come on, baby girl.

35:32.946 --> 35:34.512
- Oh, my God!
- Run to your mommy.

35:34.514 --> 35:35.680
- Mommy!
- Come here!

35:35.682 --> 35:36.616
Put that gun down.

35:37.884 --> 35:39.319
Okay...

35:40.854 --> 35:41.855
watch me now.

35:42.923 --> 35:43.924
What's that?

35:45.726 --> 35:47.794
- Huh?
- Where the fuck is Darcy, Jake?

35:48.996 --> 35:50.597
- Sonny.
- Where the fuck is Darcy?

35:51.231 --> 35:53.565
I'm gonna call my brothers
on Darcy's phone

35:53.567 --> 35:55.870
tell 'em where I am with
that money and what you owe?

35:56.571 --> 35:58.406
Well, use your imagination now.

35:59.507 --> 36:00.475
Put your gun down.

36:04.312 --> 36:05.613
Whoo! Let's go now.

36:10.518 --> 36:11.686
Clips too, player.

36:16.725 --> 36:18.292
Go ahead. Spin that over.

36:20.496 --> 36:21.930
I said, spin that shit over.

36:24.066 --> 36:24.967
Don't move.

36:28.937 --> 36:31.040
Toss them keys
to that sweet ass ride.

36:35.845 --> 36:38.748
For fuck's sake.
Which gun should I use?

36:38.948 --> 36:42.051
I don't know. So many choices,
so many guns.

36:44.487 --> 36:45.789
- Where you going?
- What do you want?

36:46.055 --> 36:49.692
Bang bang!
I want 15 years.

36:50.995 --> 36:52.460
I can't get you that.

36:54.664 --> 36:55.933
Your life will have to do.

37:01.839 --> 37:02.773
I'm right here.

37:07.545 --> 37:10.848
No. No, no, no, no Sonny,
your death is for later.

37:13.651 --> 37:14.785
I want your life.

37:15.954 --> 37:17.688
Sit down, right there.

37:21.760 --> 37:23.962
Put them handcuffs on. You know
how to use them handcuffs?

37:24.696 --> 37:25.630
Go ahead.

37:28.834 --> 37:30.602
Mm-hmm, there you go.

37:33.572 --> 37:36.408
Imma go see Megan.
See how she's feeling.

37:39.644 --> 37:41.879
- Fuck you, Jake.
- You don't got what it takes

37:41.881 --> 37:44.083
to stop me. Not yet.

38:06.206 --> 38:07.107
Fuck!

38:47.149 --> 38:49.752
- Hands off my freaking car, man!
- Police, out now!

38:50.119 --> 38:52.154
- Let me see some ID.
- Get the fuck out.

38:53.956 --> 38:55.057
Fuck, man.

38:58.261 --> 39:00.429
Where's Darcy?
Check on her, right now.

39:01.064 --> 39:02.098
<i>Darcy!</i>

39:02.765 --> 39:03.766
Darcy!

39:04.466 --> 39:07.168
- Sonny, she's not here.
- You gotta get out of the house.

39:07.170 --> 39:08.838
- No So...
- Listen to me, listen.

39:09.105 --> 39:11.107
Hey, hey.
I'll call you right back.

39:11.473 --> 39:12.876
<i>Tell me what is going on...</i>

39:13.343 --> 39:15.145
Sonny, you should see
this place.

39:16.012 --> 39:18.048
- Jake, where is she?
- <i>Oh, you'd love it.</i>

39:18.581 --> 39:21.283
- The service, impeccable.
- <i>You touch her,</i>

39:21.285 --> 39:23.720
I'll fucking destroy you, Jake.
You know that, right?

39:23.954 --> 39:26.288
You and your inbred
fucking racist brothers,

39:26.290 --> 39:28.556
your mom, your whole family.
If you touch her...

39:28.558 --> 39:31.193
Oh, now I'm starting to hear it.

39:31.195 --> 39:34.029
- Yeah, you're hearing what?
- The real you, Sonny.

39:34.031 --> 39:35.132
Fuck you, Jake.

39:35.399 --> 39:37.568
- Where is she?
- <i>Sonny, you ain't no cop.</i>

39:37.935 --> 39:40.838
You're a fraud.
That's why you're unhappy.

39:41.639 --> 39:44.074
Why you can't even make it stick
with Megan.

39:44.076 --> 39:46.011
Don't you... Don't you say
her fucking name!

39:46.211 --> 39:48.011
That's why
you can't even be yourself.

39:48.013 --> 39:49.611
You touch her,
you're a dead man.

39:49.613 --> 39:52.751
- You know that, right?
- You promise? Do you?

39:53.118 --> 39:56.019
Pinky swear? You don't have
my stuff in an hour,

39:56.021 --> 39:57.620
my brothers gonna do
a little more

39:57.622 --> 39:59.658
- than just touch her.
- I got your money, man.

40:00.192 --> 40:02.859
Just let her go.
Let her go and it's yours.

40:02.861 --> 40:04.627
Sonny, I'm losing you.

40:04.629 --> 40:07.331
I wish we could FaceTime
but believe it or not,

40:07.333 --> 40:09.066
I don't know how to use
these things.

40:09.068 --> 40:10.003

Hey, Jake.
Where'd you come from?

41:57.215 --> 41:59.317
I asked around. I heard
you roam around these parts.

42:02.787 --> 42:04.222
- Oh, my phone.
- Yeah, you dropped it.

42:04.555 --> 42:06.791
Back at the church
I found it but you were gone.

42:08.159 --> 42:10.161
- Thank you.
- This your dad or what?

42:10.496 --> 42:12.397
I'm a different kind of daddy,
girl.

42:17.768 --> 42:19.138
Your sister's been blowing
it up.

42:19.371 --> 42:21.273
Sonny has been calling too.

42:21.739 --> 42:23.242
They're not even together
anymore.

42:23.475 --> 42:24.376
Ring, ring, ring.

42:24.776 --> 42:27.279
Today, she totally flips out.
Says we have to leave the house.

42:28.380 --> 42:30.313
- Yeah, I know. I ditched her.
- Hm,

42:30.315 --> 42:31.650
you should call her back.

42:32.418 --> 42:33.785
No, let 'em wait.

42:35.754 --> 42:36.855
I should go.

42:38.124 --> 42:40.160
- Stay.
- Are you sure about that?

42:43.429 --> 42:47.066
Well, listen, if we gonna stay,
I guess Imma drink.

42:47.767 --> 42:51.738
Hey, pretty lady. Why don't you
get daddy something to drink?

42:53.973 --> 42:56.809
- You want your change back?
- Nah, you can keep it.

42:57.944 --> 43:00.013
Jesus, stare much? Alejandra go!

43:04.018 --> 43:05.252
You always carry large
like that?

43:07.755 --> 43:09.256
Oh, you know,
I've been incarcerated.

43:09.690 --> 43:12.057
I've been stamping
license plates,

43:12.059 --> 43:14.226
sewing up underwear,
working in the wood shop,

43:14.228 --> 43:16.163
training dogs. I mean,
I'm splurging, girl.

43:20.302 --> 43:21.802
Yeah, I stare much.

43:23.405 --> 43:25.273
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

43:29.177 --> 43:31.079
You know, we're going
to another party after...

43:31.479 --> 43:33.381
whatever this is,
if you wanna come.

43:35.183 --> 43:36.417
I'm a little old for that.

43:36.419 --> 43:38.552
But, I see you looking
at that boy over there.

43:38.554 --> 43:41.257
I know you want to show him
you got other plans. I get it.

43:42.857 --> 43:43.925
Come on, let's roll out.

43:45.361 --> 43:47.494
Uh, my friend Alejandra,
with the drinks.

43:47.496 --> 43:49.966
Oh, she'll take the Uber.
Come on.

43:52.435 --> 43:54.770
Um, it's Uber. Like a verb.

43:57.373 --> 43:59.275
Is it, smarty pants?

44:17.160 --> 44:19.062
- Sonny.
- Why are you still here?

44:19.464 --> 44:21.532
I'm not going anywhere
without Darcy.

44:33.144 --> 44:35.079
You hid this
when we redid the bedrooms?

44:37.482 --> 44:38.383
Yeah.

44:53.265 --> 44:54.933
Oh, my God.

45:11.484 --> 45:13.386
You know me and Sonny
used to roll, right?

45:15.588 --> 45:17.857
I got some stories.

45:18.325 --> 45:20.527
You won't believe the shit
Sonny used to get up to.

45:20.761 --> 45:23.129
- How bad was he?
- Pretty bad.

45:23.830 --> 45:28.336
You know, his mama was my mama
and my mama was his mama.

45:28.769 --> 45:30.937
We slept
in the same bed together.

45:31.605 --> 45:33.274
Watched the same cartoons.

45:34.375 --> 45:36.310
We robbed
the same jewelry stores.

45:36.510 --> 45:37.912
It wasn't always like that.

45:38.412 --> 45:40.512
We weren't always kicking
people down the stairs,

45:40.514 --> 45:42.414
taking all their welfare checks.

45:42.416 --> 45:46.354
Spending it on weed
and just acting foolish.

45:47.656 --> 45:49.591
He thought he was gonna go
to art school.

45:52.160 --> 45:53.462
Fucking Michelangelo.

45:54.296 --> 45:55.831
Sonny Michelangelo.

45:58.266 --> 46:01.269
He wasn't too bad.
Except that around here,

46:02.204 --> 46:04.539
becoming an artist is like a...

46:05.541 --> 46:07.209
finding a halo in hell.

46:09.044 --> 46:10.045
Good luck, partner.

46:11.447 --> 46:13.148
Even though
he's my brother-in-law, he...

46:13.616 --> 46:15.485
...kinda acts like my father.

46:17.086 --> 46:18.454
I kinda miss it, I guess.

46:18.721 --> 46:20.289
He's not really around anymore.

46:20.690 --> 46:22.592
We gonna bring
Sonny back around.

46:22.892 --> 46:24.193
I'll show you Sonny.

46:26.562 --> 46:28.097
I'll show you Sonny.

46:34.338 --> 46:35.339
Shit.

46:36.740 --> 46:38.342
I had it since I was 14.

46:41.345 --> 46:43.113
You seemed so distant sometimes.

46:43.547 --> 46:45.080
And, all these years, I thought,

46:45.082 --> 46:46.548
it was because of
somebody else

46:46.550 --> 46:49.920
or something else,
but it was this.

46:50.988 --> 46:52.424
I can make it up, Meg.

46:56.294 --> 46:57.295
I'll tell you what.

46:58.329 --> 46:59.297
You...

46:59.764 --> 47:01.266
you owe me now.

47:05.570 --> 47:07.505
Go find Darcy.

47:17.081 --> 47:18.082
Sonny...

47:26.725 --> 47:29.428
- This ain't the way.
- Change of plans, baby girl.

47:37.036 --> 47:39.406
<i>I got your money,
let me talk to Darcy.</i>

47:39.906 --> 47:42.375
- What money, Sonny?
- Darcy, where are you?

47:42.576 --> 47:45.109
Uh, I'm just out
with some friends.

47:45.111 --> 47:46.980
<i>Darcy, the man with you
is very dangerous.</i>

47:47.347 --> 47:49.414
<i>I'm not playing around,
tell me where you are.</i>

47:49.416 --> 47:51.284
- More dangerous than you, demon?
- What?

47:51.518 --> 47:53.251
<i>No wonder you and Megan
didn't work.</i>

47:53.253 --> 47:54.620
She thought you were a good guy.

47:54.622 --> 47:55.688
<i>Listen, I don't know</i>

47:55.690 --> 47:56.789
<i>what the fuck Jake
has told you,</i>

47:56.791 --> 47:58.256
<i>but, I need you to listen
to me.</i>

47:58.258 --> 47:59.123
Just the truth.

47:59.125 --> 48:00.359
You don't have to worry
about pretending

48:00.361 --> 48:03.094
- no more with Megan either.
- Darcy, tell me where you are!

48:05.066 --> 48:09.170
Hey, Sonny! You need to fix
these brakes, boy.

48:09.637 --> 48:11.704
<i>Hey, you relax, bro.
We're just going to a party.</i>

48:11.706 --> 48:12.708
<i>Have a little fun.</i>

48:12.941 --> 48:14.643
Hey, you remember Emilio,
don't you?

48:14.877 --> 48:17.276
You send him to the hospital
with that traffic cone?

48:17.278 --> 48:18.210
<i>You wanna come?</i>

48:18.212 --> 48:19.681
Let her out of the car
and I'll meet you.

48:19.915 --> 48:22.551
- You got what I asked for?
- <i>I got the money, man.</i>

48:22.751 --> 48:24.253
It's yours. Just let her go.

48:24.620 --> 48:26.020
I'll see you there.

48:30.325 --> 48:33.462
- What was all that about?
- My inner asshole turning out.

48:34.029 --> 48:36.265
They say you are the same age
when you leave prison

48:36.465 --> 48:37.600
as you went in.

48:39.469 --> 48:40.402
I was 14.

48:43.105 --> 48:46.108
- Maybe this is a bad idea.
- Hey, Sonny going to be there.

48:48.211 --> 48:49.812
You don't like the party,
you could leave.

48:51.514 --> 48:52.448
I promise you.

49:19.644 --> 49:22.413
Ooh, he likes you.

49:23.014 --> 49:25.282
- How you doing?
- What's wrong?

49:25.517 --> 49:27.184
My cousin not good enough
for you?

49:27.919 --> 49:30.488
No, it's just Jake and I
was supposed to go to a party.

49:30.922 --> 49:32.324
Oh, but baby...

49:35.727 --> 49:37.660
Take the seat, Frankie.
Come on, baby.

49:42.233 --> 49:43.201
Emilio.

49:46.371 --> 49:48.608
- How you doing, brother?
- So, so Sonny.

49:50.343 --> 49:52.209
Today seems
a little complicated, huh?

49:52.211 --> 49:53.546
Yeah, it seem that way.

49:53.779 --> 49:56.213
Fucking with a cop's
family, that's new heights...

49:56.215 --> 49:58.417
- for even you.
- Shit, I know.

49:58.952 --> 50:00.353
But, times is hard, man.

50:00.553 --> 50:02.723
You know the kind of cash
I gotta drop today.

50:03.090 --> 50:05.358
Send my kid off to college,
you know what I mean?

50:05.759 --> 50:06.793
Real criminal shit.

50:07.461 --> 50:11.498
- That sound like your problem.
- The more I make, cop,

50:12.032 --> 50:14.201
the more you motherfuckers take,
man.

50:14.701 --> 50:16.701
Just let her go,
she ain't a part of this.

50:16.703 --> 50:18.737
But you made her
a part of this now, man.

50:18.739 --> 50:20.641
- Call your man, Jake.
- Let her go.

50:20.875 --> 50:22.509
Well, you know whose shop
this is?

50:30.283 --> 50:31.352
Rustle this shit up.

50:44.432 --> 50:46.300
What you all waiting for?
Search him.

50:57.012 --> 50:58.447
Jake pay you yet?

50:58.881 --> 50:59.948
I ain't think so.

51:01.283 --> 51:03.252
- I'm the bag man.
- Damn, Sonny.

51:04.553 --> 51:05.789
You got some stones, man.

51:06.321 --> 51:08.590
Cop coming in the jungle,
unarmed.

51:09.092 --> 51:11.358
Slapping folks around,
conversating,

51:11.360 --> 51:13.295
fraternizing with the felons.

51:14.831 --> 51:16.766
- It's okay.
- Sonny boy, do me a favor.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.334
Kick that bread over.

51:19.469 --> 51:20.837
Who tryin' to make 700k?

51:21.538 --> 51:23.974
Any one of y'all put a hole
in his head, it's yours.

51:24.374 --> 51:25.076
Seven hundred k,

51:25.341 --> 51:27.377
put a hole in his fucking head,
you got it.

51:27.677 --> 51:29.712
Y'all niggas don't want
no money? Shoot this nigga!

51:29.714 --> 51:30.948
Nice Sonny, I'm loving it!

51:31.448 --> 51:32.983
Let me see what's in this bag.

51:34.618 --> 51:35.686
Hey, Jake...

51:36.754 --> 51:38.723
think this about 700k.

51:39.457 --> 51:42.793
Emilio? You're a man
of your word.

51:48.699 --> 51:51.569
Little friendship we developed
behind the wall.

51:52.236 --> 51:53.872
It's uh...
<i>rapprochement.</i>

51:56.007 --> 51:58.643
Something you and I
supposedly had, Sonny.

52:02.481 --> 52:04.750
Don't die on me, Sonny.

52:05.151 --> 52:06.785
Gift in your pocket.

52:13.059 --> 52:14.459
Go ahead, get your breath.

52:14.861 --> 52:17.393
Anything happen to her,
y'all motherfuckers gotta deal

52:17.395 --> 52:19.430
- with me, you understand?
- Only if you believe

52:19.432 --> 52:20.399
in reincarnation.

52:28.008 --> 52:29.042
Shit.

52:29.575 --> 52:31.410
Hold on, hell no, not in here.

52:32.079 --> 52:33.845
Y'all go ahead and kill his ass.

52:33.847 --> 52:35.381
Use the motherfucking
storage room.

52:36.984 --> 52:37.985
Good day, Sonny.

52:39.686 --> 52:40.687
Fuck you, Emilio.

52:42.089 --> 52:43.290
Fuck off!

53:05.914 --> 53:07.649
Shit man, you can
have the money, man.

53:15.456 --> 53:16.759
Sorry about the mess,
motherfucker.

53:35.145 --> 53:37.848
Where you at, Sonny boy?
Where you at?

53:45.555 --> 53:47.557
Ah! Right on time, Sonny boy!
Here you are!

53:50.594 --> 53:51.661
Come on, Sonny.

54:01.138 --> 54:02.039
Fuck!

54:03.107 --> 54:04.041
Oh!

54:11.883 --> 54:13.517
Fuck!

54:23.028 --> 54:24.593
You might have to hold
the wheel,

54:24.595 --> 54:26.064
you might have to play along,
baby girl.

54:32.804 --> 54:34.006
Here we go, baby girl.

54:34.406 --> 54:36.074
I see where your daddy's goin'.

54:37.176 --> 54:39.678
- I see you, baby.
- Sonny, watch out!

54:40.779 --> 54:41.948
Oh, shit.

54:50.556 --> 54:51.658
He's not coming back for you.

54:52.525 --> 54:55.092
- You don't know Sonny.
- Say another fucking word

54:55.094 --> 54:57.096
I'll put your fucking brains
on that little window.

55:12.780 --> 55:13.948
Where are you taking me?

55:16.951 --> 55:17.952
What are you gonna do?

55:22.090 --> 55:25.224
- Jake. Answer me!
- Hey, don't ask questions

55:25.226 --> 55:26.928
you already know answers to.

55:28.196 --> 55:29.164
Fuckin' bitch.

55:50.920 --> 55:54.321
Sonny, Sonny.
Stop! Please, stop!

56:17.147 --> 56:19.716
Go ahead, finish it.

56:20.017 --> 56:21.018
Right here.

56:21.651 --> 56:23.687
Do it in front of my mom.

56:24.121 --> 56:27.158
- Be a man like you used to be.
- Leave him alone!

56:33.765 --> 56:35.197
Do it for Joe and Kayvon,

56:35.199 --> 56:37.301
people you used
to really care about, Sonny.

56:37.635 --> 56:39.704
Do it 'cause I sent them
to hell today.

56:41.873 --> 56:44.740
- Sonny!
- Uh, so disappointed, bro.

56:44.742 --> 56:46.744
- I thought you were ready.
- I got him, cuff him.

56:58.057 --> 57:00.559
Keep looking, you might find
something you like.

57:01.326 --> 57:03.228
- Come on.
- You see that?

57:04.163 --> 57:06.963
Sonny keeps it hidden
in his house but it's there.

57:06.965 --> 57:10.036
- Yeah, what's that, Jake?
- Himself. Demon.

57:10.569 --> 57:12.272
Get this guy out of here.

57:14.874 --> 57:16.810
Can you excuse us a sec,
Darcy?

57:18.244 --> 57:19.345
You okay?

57:26.219 --> 57:28.320
Three million's missing
from that armored car

57:28.322 --> 57:29.722
Jake Banning went down for.

57:30.357 --> 57:33.392
All right, then 15 years later,
bills happen to show up

57:33.394 --> 57:35.362
and everywhere I look,
there you are.

57:36.197 --> 57:39.967
So listen, I was there.
Fifteen years ago, I was there.

57:40.835 --> 57:43.001
Not like you think,
not like it sounds.

57:43.003 --> 57:44.905
But the whole shit went down,
I was right there.

57:45.106 --> 57:48.008
Sonny... I don't know
if I can help you.

57:48.209 --> 57:50.742
What? I need you to add
this to my bill.

57:50.744 --> 57:53.812
I'm giving you an hour,
and then I gotta go to Getman.

57:53.814 --> 57:54.648
So, what do you expect me to do?

57:54.915 --> 57:56.049
I need you to at least give me
till the morning.

57:56.051 --> 57:58.619
- Let me figure something out.
- Why am I doing this?

58:02.991 --> 58:04.893
All right, I will see you
in the morning.

58:05.093 --> 58:07.062
- Early.
- Thank you, thank you.

58:23.146 --> 58:26.282
<i>I got Jake.
But, Jake got me.</i>

58:27.416 --> 58:28.684
<i>What do I do?</i>

58:29.386 --> 58:31.721
<i>Come clean, end up
in a prison cell.</i>

58:33.122 --> 58:35.159
<i>Find the rest of the cash,
bolt out of town.</i>

58:38.095 --> 58:39.762
<i>I had to find a way out.</i>

58:40.631 --> 58:42.866
<i>A way out that would protect
Megan and Darcy.</i>

58:44.835 --> 58:45.802
Darcy!

58:46.937 --> 58:49.439
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, it's okay.

58:50.174 --> 58:53.744
It's okay.
Here, get in the house.

59:01.286 --> 59:04.255
You comfortable?
You have everything you need?

59:05.757 --> 59:06.824
I miss this place.

59:07.859 --> 59:08.860
Home sweet home.

59:11.530 --> 59:13.129
You probably think I'm some

59:13.131 --> 59:15.233
irredeemable piece of crap,
don't you?

59:16.034 --> 59:19.136
Without one single drop
of human compassion.

59:19.138 --> 59:20.239
No, I'm wrong.

59:20.673 --> 59:22.374
Sonny must've really loved you.

59:22.975 --> 59:25.542
He sacrificed who he was
as a cop and a man

59:25.544 --> 59:27.079
to try and stop you.

59:29.048 --> 59:30.049
Me?

59:30.716 --> 59:33.152
I'd have put a bullet in
your head first chance I got.

59:35.488 --> 59:36.889
You hate him, Jake?

59:39.858 --> 59:42.728
- I love him like a brother.
- So all this just to hurt him?

59:44.097 --> 59:45.764
Self-help, Detective.

59:47.033 --> 59:49.035
I'm trying to get
his balls back.

59:53.340 --> 59:55.443
You're afraid of me,
aren't you, Detective?

59:57.978 --> 59:59.513
I am afraid of getting you
on my shoe.

01:00:02.048 --> 01:00:02.983
Ah...

01:00:11.425 --> 01:00:12.426
All right.

01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:15.060
Well, I'm gonna finish the rest
up tomorrow

01:00:15.062 --> 01:00:16.797
'cause I still got let
some of this dry.

01:00:17.164 --> 01:00:18.467
Yeah, I should get going.

01:00:19.867 --> 01:00:20.868
It's late.

01:00:21.969 --> 01:00:23.104
Stay.

01:00:23.971 --> 01:00:26.174
Stay? Are you sure
you want me to stay?

01:00:26.807 --> 01:00:29.777
You remember where the couch is?

01:00:31.113 --> 01:00:32.080
Yeah?

01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:36.151
Are you a comedian now, huh?

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:39.021
It's good to see you smile.

01:00:43.426 --> 01:00:45.927
- Good night, baby.
- Good night.

01:00:49.232 --> 01:00:50.799
The armored car.

01:00:51.901 --> 01:00:53.367
- Huh?
- Sonny Carson was there

01:00:53.369 --> 01:00:54.937
15 years ago, wasn't he?

01:00:58.975 --> 01:01:01.077
You keep checking,
you got somewhere to be?

01:01:05.148 --> 01:01:06.082
All right.

01:01:10.654 --> 01:01:12.056
I'm turning it off.

01:01:12.389 --> 01:01:15.025
If you can help me out here,
I can help Sonny.

01:01:15.492 --> 01:01:17.861
Clearly, we both care
about the guy in our own...

01:01:18.462 --> 01:01:19.463
twisted way.

01:01:20.431 --> 01:01:21.499
You and Sonny?

01:01:22.299 --> 01:01:23.233
Talk to me.

01:01:27.204 --> 01:01:32.310
Question first.
Are you L, G, B, or T?

01:01:34.679 --> 01:01:36.446
You've been in prison too long,
Jake.

01:01:36.448 --> 01:01:38.216
See, that shit's
not funny anymore.

01:02:29.737 --> 01:02:31.406
I thought Jake
was gonna kill me.

01:02:34.342 --> 01:02:36.411
I'm so sorry I got you
into this, Darcy.

01:02:38.646 --> 01:02:39.981
Well, what's wrong with him?

01:02:41.182 --> 01:02:42.183
Is he crazy?

01:02:42.717 --> 01:02:43.951
You and Meg,

01:02:44.185 --> 01:02:45.520
you're the best thing
I ever had.

01:02:47.623 --> 01:02:48.722
Jake never had that.

01:02:48.724 --> 01:02:50.459
He doesn't have much love
in him.

01:02:52.694 --> 01:02:54.229
He wasn't always like that
though.

01:02:57.232 --> 01:02:58.267
What's gonna happen to you?

01:03:01.537 --> 01:03:02.704
I'm gonna be all right.

01:03:07.142 --> 01:03:08.510
Don't you worry about me,
okay?

01:03:10.345 --> 01:03:11.346
Oh.

01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:16.219
Just remember that Megan and I
are always here for you.

01:03:26.429 --> 01:03:28.298
- Sonny?
- Jake escaped.

01:03:32.268 --> 01:03:33.269
Now, come on.

01:04:02.534 --> 01:04:03.468
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

01:04:03.802 --> 01:04:06.037
<i>You know what's ironic, Lorna?</i>

01:04:06.638 --> 01:04:07.572
<i>Huh?</i>

01:04:09.741 --> 01:04:12.511
<i>You are on my shoe.</i>

01:04:14.279 --> 01:04:15.280
Sonny?

01:04:17.783 --> 01:04:20.653
- Where are you going?
- To find my brother.

01:04:29.595 --> 01:04:30.630
One for you...

01:04:32.265 --> 01:04:33.232
one for you...

01:04:34.868 --> 01:04:36.168
and one for me.

01:04:38.037 --> 01:04:39.272
Blaine!

01:04:42.208 --> 01:04:43.742
- Fuck!
- Jake. Jake Banning.

01:04:43.744 --> 01:04:45.477
- I don't know.
- Where is Jake?

01:04:45.479 --> 01:04:46.745
You're a fucking liar.
Give me that.

01:04:46.747 --> 01:04:47.814
What are you doing?

01:04:48.148 --> 01:04:50.181
- I don't know.
- Jake Banning.

01:04:50.183 --> 01:04:51.318
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

01:04:54.288 --> 01:04:56.691
High end military shit, Blaine.

01:04:57.090 --> 01:04:59.159
Assault rifles, grenades.

01:04:59.527 --> 01:05:01.494
That's all you, baby.
That's your shit.

01:05:01.496 --> 01:05:02.497
You're a dead man.

01:05:02.764 --> 01:05:05.698
Oh, two shots, let's try three.

01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:07.300
Stop! You're gonna kill him.

01:05:07.302 --> 01:05:08.734
You feel fucking good,
don't you?

01:05:08.736 --> 01:05:10.572
What you got here?
You got fucking dick pills.

01:05:10.772 --> 01:05:12.807
You can't get your dick up
on these fucking hoes here?

01:05:13.207 --> 01:05:15.441
This will help, open up.

01:05:15.443 --> 01:05:17.811
Your fucking heart's
gonna explode, nigga.

01:05:17.813 --> 01:05:19.145
You better give it up.

01:05:19.147 --> 01:05:20.516
Stop!

01:05:21.684 --> 01:05:25.119
Don't die, don't die.
Hold on, hold on.

01:05:25.454 --> 01:05:27.121
Eat them up, use your words.

01:05:27.423 --> 01:05:29.690
- Use your words.
- I don't know. I don't know.

01:05:29.692 --> 01:05:32.194
Use your fucking words. Tell me.

01:05:32.394 --> 01:05:34.330
- I don't know.
- Where the fuck is Jake?

01:05:34.763 --> 01:05:36.263
Where the fuck is Jake?

01:05:36.265 --> 01:05:37.566
Just tell him
where Jake is.

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:42.670
- Jake's brothers...
- Just... Just tell him!

01:05:42.672 --> 01:05:43.707
They're at...

01:05:44.641 --> 01:05:47.477
- Let him go.
- They're at the fucking Rat.

01:05:50.647 --> 01:05:52.248
You better not be fucking
with me.

01:05:55.719 --> 01:05:57.253
He's gonna need an ambulance.

No, 'cause see, I'm...

01:09:09.654 --> 01:09:11.024
God damn!

01:09:12.758 --> 01:09:16.062
Mm. Nutritious.

01:09:18.765 --> 01:09:19.765
Damn, Sonny.

01:09:21.033 --> 01:09:24.504
- You in hell yet?
- I'm on my way, bruh.

01:09:25.904 --> 01:09:26.973
Come here, girl.

01:09:28.774 --> 01:09:31.078
Not what I just heard.

01:09:31.778 --> 01:09:32.947
No, no, no.

01:09:33.546 --> 01:09:36.050
Hey, Sonny. Be honest with me.

01:09:38.051 --> 01:09:40.120
Is that not the finest ass
you've ever seen?

01:09:40.453 --> 01:09:43.057
I mean, it's better than Megan's
little speed bump, right?

01:09:44.758 --> 01:09:45.492
Hey.

01:09:45.826 --> 01:09:47.862
How many years do you think
this is all worth?

01:09:49.129 --> 01:09:51.496
Snorting pure Columbian,
all for fun,

01:09:51.497 --> 01:09:54.135
till she likes that, huh?
Maybe like two, three years.

01:09:55.036 --> 01:09:56.071
Maybe.

01:09:57.205 --> 01:10:00.441
Somehow it just doesn't seem
to add up. I don't know why.

01:10:01.009 --> 01:10:02.409
Give me a light, baby.

01:10:03.979 --> 01:10:07.749
I mean, brother Kayvon, maybe
he's worth two, three years.

01:10:08.817 --> 01:10:10.685
Maybe. Joe?

01:10:12.687 --> 01:10:15.891
Joe wasn't worth shit from jump,
if you ask me. So, uh,

01:10:16.359 --> 01:10:19.829
never mind. I give him a year
because I'm feeling charitable.

01:10:20.796 --> 01:10:21.831
But all this shit here?

01:10:26.035 --> 01:10:27.670
Maybe five or six years.

01:10:29.071 --> 01:10:31.939
- You're losing me, Jake.
- Yeah, me too, Jake.

01:10:31.941 --> 01:10:35.112
I'm talking about my life,
you fucking dodo head!

01:10:35.611 --> 01:10:37.647
Fifteen fucking years.

01:10:38.248 --> 01:10:40.650
You go and try make
them years up. It's not easy.

01:10:40.851 --> 01:10:43.486
I've tried it.
I've got my hands full.

01:10:43.954 --> 01:10:45.620
I've done fucked and killed

01:10:45.622 --> 01:10:48.056
everything I can get my little
itty bitty fucking hands on.

01:10:48.058 --> 01:10:49.758
It's just doesn't seem
to add up.

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.128
I'm not being given my due.

01:10:53.563 --> 01:10:54.998
All this shit here is just...

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:57.168
boring.

01:10:57.467 --> 01:10:59.503
It's all been done before.

01:11:01.638 --> 01:11:02.941
It's really depressing me.

01:11:04.508 --> 01:11:05.910
It's been a depressing day.

01:11:10.949 --> 01:11:12.483
And then there's you, Sonny.

01:11:14.052 --> 01:11:15.219
You remind me...

01:11:18.523 --> 01:11:20.725
My brother, you keep me going.

01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:24.760
And that pretty little whore
right there,

01:11:24.762 --> 01:11:27.900
she told me the greatest story
I've ever heard.

01:11:28.834 --> 01:11:30.836
That shit you did to that pimp,

01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:33.003
that's the type of shit
that keeps me warm

01:11:33.005 --> 01:11:34.206
and fuzzy at night.

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:37.977
You tortured that boy
just to get to me. I love it.

01:11:39.678 --> 01:11:41.247
- I love it.
- Hey, Kelly,

01:11:42.781 --> 01:11:46.485
- go, get out of here. Kelly, go!
- Kelly, stay.

01:11:47.653 --> 01:11:48.654
Stick around.

01:11:50.056 --> 01:11:51.057
Hey.

01:11:54.661 --> 01:11:55.996
You recognize it, huh?

01:11:56.730 --> 01:11:58.330
It belong to uh...

01:11:58.332 --> 01:12:00.767
Whoever the fuck...
What was her name? Lori?

01:12:01.034 --> 01:12:03.104
Donny? What's her name, Sonny?

01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:05.039
- Lorna.
- Lorna.

01:12:05.572 --> 01:12:09.844
- Yeah, Jake, her name is Lorna.
- She's right there, say hello.

01:12:10.878 --> 01:12:11.946
She on my shoe.

01:12:16.317 --> 01:12:19.553
One in the chamber, partner.
Go ahead, finish me.

01:12:20.054 --> 01:12:21.787
I know you got an end game.

01:12:21.789 --> 01:12:23.589
You ain't come up
in this butcher shop

01:12:23.591 --> 01:12:25.826
like a dumb little lamb chop
now, did you?

01:12:30.298 --> 01:12:31.733
I'm not gonna shoot you, Jake.

01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:36.705
I'm not gonna shoot you,
you know why?

01:12:39.741 --> 01:12:41.176
'Cause that's what you want.

01:12:43.779 --> 01:12:45.580
And look here, brother.

01:12:47.150 --> 01:12:48.151
Demon.

01:12:49.919 --> 01:12:51.753
24/7, life in prison.

01:12:52.188 --> 01:12:55.122
Twenty-three and one.
You don't count days,

01:12:55.124 --> 01:12:59.293
you count push-ups, right boy?
That's what I call hell.

01:12:59.295 --> 01:13:00.863
Hey!

01:13:01.330 --> 01:13:03.132
Ain't nobody shoot homie
but me.

01:13:07.237 --> 01:13:08.704
What, Sonny? We boring you?

01:13:08.971 --> 01:13:10.340
Nah Jake...

01:13:10.773 --> 01:13:12.176
...I thought you knew me.

01:13:14.677 --> 01:13:15.946
You got a plan now, huh?

01:13:16.747 --> 01:13:17.648
Nah...

01:13:19.316 --> 01:13:20.350
just winging it.

01:13:50.316 --> 01:13:51.317
You kiddin' me?

01:13:53.751 --> 01:13:55.154
That supposed to hurt?

01:13:55.521 --> 01:13:57.755
What do you know about pain?
Huh?

01:13:58.357 --> 01:13:59.959
Hey, look me in my eyes.

01:14:01.861 --> 01:14:03.629
It's like looking in a mirror,
huh?

01:14:08.335 --> 01:14:11.304
How about one last drink?
Huh?

01:14:11.971 --> 01:14:12.938
One more.

01:14:17.344 --> 01:14:19.846
Ah.

01:14:21.414 --> 01:14:23.884
Shit.

01:14:26.953 --> 01:14:28.054
Sonny.

01:15:13.101 --> 01:15:15.305
<i>Demons always use
your secrets against you.</i>

01:15:16.972 --> 01:15:21.110
<i>Those dark corners where
you keep all the hurt and pain.</i>

01:15:23.046 --> 01:15:24.414
<i>They summon you.</i>

01:15:26.783 --> 01:15:29.118
<i>That's why I knew where Jake
wanted me to find him.</i>

01:15:30.453 --> 01:15:32.288
<i>The place where his pain
was rooted.</i>

01:15:35.292 --> 01:15:37.794
<i>Place he's been stuck
for the last 15 years.</i>

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:24.009
- Yeah, it figures.
- Where else is there?

01:16:28.547 --> 01:16:30.783
When I was in prison,
I owned you, Sonny.

01:16:33.519 --> 01:16:34.787
When I got out...

01:16:36.623 --> 01:16:38.357
guess I don't want to
give you up.

01:16:39.859 --> 01:16:42.026
Jake, listen to me
and I really want you to hear

01:16:42.028 --> 01:16:43.196
what I'm saying.

01:16:43.764 --> 01:16:45.996
Okay, Sonny,
I'm really listening.

01:16:45.998 --> 01:16:47.100
I didn't take your life.

01:16:47.467 --> 01:16:50.135
You made your own decision,
lost your own 15 years

01:16:50.137 --> 01:16:51.171
I don't owe you shit.

01:16:51.805 --> 01:16:53.840
Why would I do that to myself?

01:16:56.410 --> 01:16:57.444
'Cause you rotten.

01:17:03.618 --> 01:17:05.852
Some would say I'm a product
of my environment.

01:17:06.086 --> 01:17:08.489
No, I used to say that
to myself too. It's not true.

01:17:09.157 --> 01:17:11.859
Something's been fucked up
inside of you for a long time.

01:17:16.431 --> 01:17:17.398
You feelin' that?

01:17:20.101 --> 01:17:21.470
It's the fucking rush, man.

01:17:22.937 --> 01:17:26.074
It's the uncertainty.
It fucking kills me.

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:30.079
That ain't gonna be
what kill you, Jake.

01:17:31.447 --> 01:17:32.481
Oh, yeah?

01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:35.884
What's gonna fucking kill me?

01:17:42.224 --> 01:17:43.959
You should've went
to South America.

01:17:45.462 --> 01:17:47.196
Oh, I see it now.

01:17:48.264 --> 01:17:49.566
Sonny, I feel it now.

01:17:51.234 --> 01:17:52.369
Oh, it's beautiful.

01:17:53.436 --> 01:17:54.971
It's fucking poetic, man.

01:17:56.373 --> 01:17:57.407
I know now.

01:17:57.808 --> 01:18:00.343
I know now, you know,
you got it back.

01:18:02.011 --> 01:18:03.012
Do you?

01:18:03.547 --> 01:18:04.448
Do you, Sonny?

01:18:05.416 --> 01:18:10.019
Come on, look me in my eyes.
I wanna see it.

01:18:11.389 --> 01:18:13.290
I know you're dying to pull
that trigger.

01:18:15.292 --> 01:18:16.293
Here we go.

01:18:17.328 --> 01:18:19.263
Hey, how does it feel to be me?

01:18:20.732 --> 01:18:22.533
Huh? Do it.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.137
If you don't do this,
I'll be back. I'll just get out.

01:18:26.505 --> 01:18:29.073
I'll find Megan.
I'll find little Darcy.

01:18:29.508 --> 01:18:31.641
I'll find everybody
you pretended to love

01:18:31.643 --> 01:18:34.011
and care about, I'll take 'em
away from you, boy.

01:18:34.546 --> 01:18:36.980
I'll take your life away
from you piece by piece.

01:18:36.982 --> 01:18:38.083
Get on your fucking knees.

01:18:40.452 --> 01:18:41.987
Get on your fucking knees, Jake.

01:18:42.654 --> 01:18:43.656
Here we go.

01:18:47.727 --> 01:18:49.261
How did it go, Sonny?

01:18:49.662 --> 01:18:51.662
One would say,
"We're going straight to hell."

01:18:51.664 --> 01:18:53.165
What the other one say?

01:18:55.301 --> 01:18:56.636
How'd it go, Sonny? Tell me.

01:18:57.770 --> 01:18:59.138
Sonny, how'd it go?

01:19:10.684 --> 01:19:11.951
Sorry, brother.

01:19:13.587 --> 01:19:15.322
You can go to hell
all by yourself.

01:19:16.256 --> 01:19:17.658
It doesn't end like this.

01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:40.615
Sonny!

01:20:09.779 --> 01:20:10.780
See?

01:20:13.249 --> 01:20:14.350
You and me...

01:20:15.184 --> 01:20:17.420
like lookin'
in the goddamn mirror.

01:20:19.088 --> 01:20:20.357
You're like me, brother.

01:20:23.293 --> 01:20:24.361
Welcome back, Demon.

01:20:27.831 --> 01:20:29.232
I never left, brother.

01:21:00.399 --> 01:21:01.466
Bring Sonny Carson in.

01:21:06.505 --> 01:21:08.607
<i>You see, we all have
demons inside of us.</i>

01:21:09.841 --> 01:21:11.643
<i>The difference between me
and Jake...</i>

01:21:12.377 --> 01:21:15.547
<i>...he needed to feed his.</i>

01:21:17.817 --> 01:21:19.284
<i>I had to kill mine.</i>

01:21:21.386 --> 01:21:23.756
<i>But destroying your demons
won't always set you free.</i>

01:21:25.792 --> 01:21:27.327
<i>Only the truth can do that.</i>

01:21:28.895 --> 01:21:31.397
<i>Did I want to keep the money?
Sure I did.</i>

01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:35.735
<i>But I'm on my own road now,
with the people I love.</i>

01:21:37.270 --> 01:21:39.372
