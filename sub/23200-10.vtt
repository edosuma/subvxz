00:37.456 --> 00:39.333
Gosh! Wonder Woman.

00:41.585 --> 00:42.962
Wonder Woman!

02:31.910 --> 02:33.370
Yes.

02:34.079 --> 02:36.206
Sure. Put him on. Line 1?

02:38.333 --> 02:41.212
Yes, Doctor. I beg your pardon?

02:44.715 --> 02:48.386
No, I don't mind coming down.
I appreciate your calling.

02:49.887 --> 02:52.056
Fine. I'll be right there.

03:02.693 --> 03:03.902
- Steve.
- Yeah.

03:03.985 --> 03:07.155
- I've got to run over to the hospital.
- What's happened?

03:07.239 --> 03:10.742
Ten minutes ago, Wonder Woman
was brought into Emergency.

03:10.827 --> 03:12.078
Okay.

03:14.080 --> 03:16.624
What? Diana.

03:21.420 --> 03:25.424
We realized almost immediately
that it wasn't the real Wonder Woman.

03:25.508 --> 03:29.596
- But we called the IADC anyway.
- Why?

03:30.013 --> 03:33.767
Because of the resemblance, with
the makeup and the wig she was wearing.

03:33.850 --> 03:36.269
She's been unconscious
since they brought her in.

03:36.353 --> 03:38.146
Is she going to be all right?

03:38.230 --> 03:40.941
X- rays show a concussion
but she seems to be very fit.

03:41.024 --> 03:44.904
- She'll pull through with no problem.
- And you have no idea who she is.

03:44.987 --> 03:47.865
Actually, I was rather hoping
that you might tell us...

03:47.949 --> 03:50.785
knowing Wonder Woman's affiliation
with the IADC.

03:50.868 --> 03:53.621
Obviously, she isn't
the real Wonder Woman, but-

03:53.704 --> 03:57.458
But obviously she or somebody else
is taking advantage of the resemblance.

03:57.542 --> 04:00.462
If you don't wish to tell me
the whole story, I understand.

04:00.546 --> 04:03.298
Secrets are the prerogative of the IADC.

04:03.382 --> 04:06.134
I assure you, Doctor,
that we don't know who she is, either.

04:06.218 --> 04:08.303
But it might be a good idea to find out.

04:08.387 --> 04:10.806
Can I have a look at the costume
she was wearing?

04:10.889 --> 04:12.140
Certainly.

04:19.273 --> 04:21.608
Dr. Jacob, please report...

04:21.692 --> 04:25.279
Due to the unusual nature of this case,
we had it locked up.

04:26.030 --> 04:29.242
- The clothes from Room 408, please.
- Certainly, Doctor.

04:37.668 --> 04:40.712
You can get into med school
on a football scholarship?

04:40.796 --> 04:41.838
Hardly.

04:41.922 --> 04:46.176
Seems to me like he ought to be wearing
a football jersey instead of a lab coat.

04:46.260 --> 04:48.012
- Who?
- Him.

04:48.096 --> 04:50.848
The other physician attending to
our Mary Doe.

04:54.102 --> 04:57.230
As far as I know, I'm the only one
who's been assigned to her.

05:04.363 --> 05:05.906
What are you doing?

05:19.002 --> 05:21.089
- She's okay.
- Get security.

07:36.064 --> 07:38.024
There's no way to trace that syringe?

07:38.107 --> 07:41.861
It contained a lethal mixture of chemicals
found naturally in the human body...

07:41.945 --> 07:43.530
and easily obtained.

07:43.613 --> 07:46.492
Whoever tried to kill her
knew what he was doing.

07:46.575 --> 07:49.078
Maybe the costume will give us
some answers.

07:49.161 --> 07:53.123
Remember, Sgt. Cline, no one enters
unless his or her name is on that list.

07:53.207 --> 07:54.667
Yes, Ma'am.

08:07.889 --> 08:10.433
Please report to the main office.

08:19.735 --> 08:21.904
Dr. Riley, please call your service.

08:25.324 --> 08:28.452
Yes, this is Lt. Smith, 19th Precinct.

08:28.535 --> 08:30.621
I must talk to Sgt. Cline.

08:30.704 --> 08:33.917
I believe he's on duty there
at the hospital, fourth floor?

08:34.793 --> 08:36.461
Thank you.

08:39.255 --> 08:41.716
Yes, he is.
One moment, please. I'll get him.

08:41.799 --> 08:44.886
Could even fool the real Wonder Woman,
don't you think?

08:44.969 --> 08:46.387
I don't know.

08:48.431 --> 08:51.727
Good, a label.
"McCoy Wardrobe, Arlington, Virginia. "

08:51.811 --> 08:54.146
That shouldn't be too hard to check out.

08:54.230 --> 08:56.065
Thank you very much.

08:56.148 --> 08:58.734
- Sgt. Cline here.
- I'd like to know as soon as...

08:58.817 --> 09:01.737
she comes around. Let me know
when you find out who she is.

09:01.820 --> 09:04.323
- Is someone on the line?
- There was.

09:04.782 --> 09:06.785
Is something wrong, Sgt. Cline?

09:06.868 --> 09:09.079
She said I had an urgent call
from headquarters.

09:09.162 --> 09:11.498
- He did.
- Guess someone made a mistake.

09:13.416 --> 09:14.667
Oh, no.

09:21.591 --> 09:22.885
Nancy.

09:24.804 --> 09:27.306
One move and you're dead.
Step away from there.

09:27.389 --> 09:28.474
Now!

09:28.557 --> 09:31.060
- Okay, no problem.
- Drop that and kick it over here.

09:31.143 --> 09:33.229
- They're just roses.
- Do it.

09:36.982 --> 09:39.319
Now get up against the wall
and spread them.

09:45.533 --> 09:47.743
Relax, Sergeant. They are roses.

09:48.282 --> 09:50.554
Not until I find out
what's in his pockets.

09:52.540 --> 09:54.042
Spread them.

09:55.878 --> 09:59.882
- Who are you?
- Todd Daniels. I'm a friend of Nancy's.

10:00.424 --> 10:03.511
I figured maybe no one was supposed
to see her, but I had to.

10:03.594 --> 10:05.012
I've been worried sick.

10:05.095 --> 10:07.389
- That's her name? Nancy?
- Nancy Clark.

10:07.473 --> 10:10.977
- Is she going to be all right?
- She had a concussion but she'll be fine.

10:11.061 --> 10:13.521
- Thank goodness.
- He's clean. Come on, buddy-

10:13.605 --> 10:16.650
Wait a second, Sergeant.
Let me have a minute with him, okay.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.737
How did you know Nancy was here?

10:21.821 --> 10:25.158
I heard on the news that a girl wearing
a Wonder Woman costume...

10:25.241 --> 10:28.329
was hospitalized.
So I figured it was Nancy.

10:28.412 --> 10:29.497
Why?

10:30.081 --> 10:32.583
What was she doing
posing as Wonder Woman?

10:32.666 --> 10:35.002
She poses as a lot of things.

10:35.086 --> 10:37.713
She's a model. Wants to be an actress.

10:37.797 --> 10:40.758
I keep telling her,
"Don't worry, you'll be one. "

10:42.426 --> 10:44.179
She's so beautiful.

10:47.474 --> 10:50.560
- Who hired her?
- I don't know. She didn't tell me.

10:50.644 --> 10:52.854
- Did you ask?
- Yeah.

10:55.190 --> 10:57.525
Well, I wonder why she didn't tell you.

10:59.737 --> 11:01.864
Okay. She wouldn't tell me.

11:01.947 --> 11:04.700
She wouldn't. So she's not your girlfriend?

11:08.871 --> 11:11.874
No, she's a girl
who lives upstairs from me. That's all.

11:11.957 --> 11:15.462
- Where do you live, Todd?
- Claremont Apartments on Third.

11:15.545 --> 11:18.548
Just head right on back there, fella.
And you darn well-

11:18.632 --> 11:21.718
Look, I'm gonna stay,
if it's all the same to you.

11:21.801 --> 11:25.222
- It's not. You're leaving.
- Wait, Sergeant. Let him stay.

11:25.764 --> 11:29.434
- If there's another attempt on her life-
- Attempt on her life?

11:29.517 --> 11:31.437
- No way I'm leaving.
- Look, kid-

11:31.520 --> 11:34.690
Let him stay. I'll take full responsibility.

11:36.901 --> 11:40.488
Okay. Full responsibility. You heard her.

11:47.704 --> 11:49.664
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

11:50.123 --> 11:52.083
Don't worry about her. She'll be fine.

11:52.167 --> 11:54.920
Just press the buzzer for the doctor
when she comes around.

11:55.003 --> 11:57.088
I'll do that. Miss?

11:57.464 --> 12:00.133
- Yes.
- What kind of trouble is she in?

12:01.134 --> 12:03.512
That's what I intend to find out.

12:15.107 --> 12:16.359
You idiot!

12:16.442 --> 12:19.738
First that girl goes wandering
all over creation in that costume...

12:19.821 --> 12:22.991
then you botch the only opportunity
we have to get rid of her.

12:23.075 --> 12:26.119
You're every bit as muscle-brained
as you appear.

12:26.203 --> 12:29.372
I told her time and time again,
don't wear it in public.

12:29.456 --> 12:30.791
What more could I do?

12:30.874 --> 12:33.376
You could have made sure
she didn't wear it in public.

12:33.460 --> 12:35.630
She was on her way home
from our dress rehearsal.

12:35.713 --> 12:38.633
How was I supposed to know
she'd try and rescue some dumb kid?

12:38.716 --> 12:42.136
The point is, she did.
And now all my plans are ruined.

12:42.219 --> 12:45.139
Look, just get me any one
of those other girls you auditioned.

12:45.222 --> 12:47.892
I can teach her the stunts
by tomorrow night. Guaranteed.

12:47.975 --> 12:50.353
That's the least of my problems,
you imbecile.

12:50.436 --> 12:54.232
Thanks to your trainee and you,
the police are involved.

12:54.316 --> 12:57.861
To say nothing of the real Wonder Woman
and probably the IADC.

12:57.944 --> 13:00.530
- If that girl opens her mouth-
- She's not going to.

13:00.614 --> 13:03.325
I warned her about people
with overactive vocal chords.

13:03.408 --> 13:07.329
Just like you warned her real good
not to wear that costume in public.

13:07.412 --> 13:10.333
When she comes to and finds out
someone tried to kill her...

13:10.416 --> 13:12.710
she'll keep her mouth shut. Guaranteed.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.587
Very well, Mr. Roman.

13:14.670 --> 13:17.590
I'm going to call in one of our runners-up.

13:18.049 --> 13:21.385
You will have 24 hours to get her ready.

13:21.469 --> 13:24.514
- No problem.
- No mistakes.

13:51.125 --> 13:54.337
Gentlemen, I said four tables up front,
not five.

13:54.420 --> 13:57.174
Five tables up front
ruins the entire floor plan.

13:58.550 --> 14:01.845
Please, gentlemen, be very careful
with that statue.

14:03.555 --> 14:06.516
- Mr. Percy. It's good to see you.
- Thank you.

14:07.434 --> 14:10.437
You look a bit bedraggled,
especially for 2:00 in the afternoon.

14:10.520 --> 14:12.272
I just heard from Mrs. Havenhurst.

14:12.355 --> 14:15.568
Everybody that she invited to
this charity dinner tomorrow is coming.

14:15.651 --> 14:18.696
- Every last one.
- That's only 30 people. Isn't it, John?

14:18.780 --> 14:22.074
Only 30? They're only the 30
richest people in Washington.

14:22.158 --> 14:24.160
Maybe in the entire country.

14:25.036 --> 14:28.247
"The Golden Thirty. "
Right here in the hotel that I work for.

14:28.331 --> 14:30.542
What a marvelous opportunity
to introduce...

14:30.626 --> 14:34.171
so many highly influential people
to Myerton hospitality.

14:35.297 --> 14:38.508
Or sour them on it for good
in case anything goes wrong.

14:39.009 --> 14:41.178
- Care for some coffee?
- Not for me, thank you.

14:41.261 --> 14:43.638
- Do you mind if I do?
- Not at all. Go ahead.

14:44.348 --> 14:47.810
- Nothing's likely to go wrong, is it, John?
- No, of course not.

14:47.894 --> 14:49.937
There, you see, you worry too much.

14:50.021 --> 14:52.398
I'm sure everything will go as planned.

14:52.482 --> 14:54.901
In the meantime,
I'd like to rehearse my models...

14:54.984 --> 14:57.236
on the stage this evening,
if that's all right.

14:57.320 --> 14:59.155
As long as I get to watch.

14:59.238 --> 15:01.783
I understand your models
are really quite something.

15:01.867 --> 15:04.328
It's all in the eye of the beholder, John.

15:04.411 --> 15:08.081
And perhaps in a well-placed dab
of makeup or two.

15:08.665 --> 15:11.710
- Well, I'll see you this evening, then.
- Right, Mr. Percy.

15:11.793 --> 15:13.754
- Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

15:18.176 --> 15:21.721
No, gentlemen. I said four tables up front.

15:21.804 --> 15:24.599
Not three, not five. Four.

15:25.308 --> 15:27.477
That many. You see?

15:42.993 --> 15:45.829
Would you page Mr. John Austin, please?

15:46.246 --> 15:50.293
John Austin, call on house line three.
John Austin.

15:50.752 --> 15:52.295
Thank you.

15:59.302 --> 16:00.762
John Austin.

16:00.970 --> 16:04.140
I sincerely hope that Mrs. Havenhurst's
charming husband...

16:04.223 --> 16:07.603
is still planning to attend
your hotel's bash tomorroW night.

16:10.814 --> 16:12.274
Listen, you creep.

16:12.357 --> 16:16.320
Your threats didn't frighten me two days
ago and they don't frighten me now.

16:16.403 --> 16:20.199
Why should you be frightened?
It isn't you I intend to murder.

16:28.041 --> 16:30.501
They're just crank calls, Steve.
Nothing more.

16:30.585 --> 16:33.379
If somebody really wanted
to kill Ambassador Havenhurst...

16:33.463 --> 16:35.590
why would he call me
and tell me about it?

16:35.673 --> 16:39.136
And why would he do it at
a charity event featuring a fashion show?

16:39.678 --> 16:42.931
If you're convinced the guy's a crackpot,
what are you doing here?

16:43.015 --> 16:44.224
Advice, old buddy.

16:44.308 --> 16:46.935
I was hoping you might suggest
a way out of this mess.

16:47.019 --> 16:49.438
- Did you tell anybody else at the hotel?
- No way.

16:49.521 --> 16:52.149
This shindig tomorrow night
will be the biggest event...

16:52.232 --> 16:54.944
ever held at a Myerton Hotel
anyplace in the nation.

16:55.028 --> 16:58.698
If I do anything to mess this up,
there goes my whole career with Myerton.

16:58.781 --> 17:01.576
If you don't cancel the event
and something does happen...

17:01.659 --> 17:03.286
Not only do I lose my career...

17:03.369 --> 17:06.789
I could have somebody's death on
my conscience for the rest of my life.

17:06.873 --> 17:09.334
So you're in no position to take a chance...

17:09.416 --> 17:12.046
- that those calls weren't for real.
- Exactly.

17:13.338 --> 17:15.799
All right.
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

17:15.883 --> 17:19.136
Because it's a government official
whose life has been threatened...

17:19.219 --> 17:21.512
I can make security arrangements
for your show.

17:21.597 --> 17:25.099
- Steve, I don't want to put you in a bond.
- It's no problem. Really.

17:25.184 --> 17:26.435
Thanks.

17:26.519 --> 17:30.481
If word of this leaks out,
the party's ruined and I'm down the drain.

17:31.524 --> 17:34.694
I'll stop by tonight and take a close look
at the setup...

17:34.777 --> 17:38.239
and maybe we can come up with
some very discreet security measures.

17:41.492 --> 17:43.996
Hello. Oh, yeah. Thanks a lot.

17:45.122 --> 17:49.084
- A government agency discreet?
- There's a first time for everything.

17:49.168 --> 17:50.836
- See you tonight.
- Okay.

17:50.919 --> 17:52.880
- Thanks, Steve.
- You bet.

17:55.883 --> 17:57.217
Diana?

17:57.926 --> 18:00.388
Hi, Steve.
You got anything on Nancy Clark?

18:00.472 --> 18:03.183
As a matter of fact, I do. A police record.

18:03.683 --> 18:04.934
You're kidding.

18:05.018 --> 18:08.438
Nothing big, but she won't want to
brag about it back home, either.

18:08.521 --> 18:11.858
- Trace that costume yet?
- Just talked to the costume shop owner.

18:11.941 --> 18:15.070
Getting him to tell me whom
he made it for was like pulling teeth.

18:15.154 --> 18:17.656
But he gave me a name and address.
I'm on my way there.

18:17.740 --> 18:19.283
Okay, but keep me posted.

18:19.366 --> 18:21.285
I'll be very interested to know why...

18:21.368 --> 18:23.912
a girl with a police record
was posing as Wonder Woman.

18:25.122 --> 18:26.457
So will I.

18:51.275 --> 18:52.484
Nancy?

18:57.698 --> 19:00.159
Hi, kiddo. How you doing?

19:01.827 --> 19:02.996
Toad.

19:04.998 --> 19:08.460
- Todd.
- I know your name.

19:10.545 --> 19:12.380
What are you doing...

19:14.757 --> 19:16.551
What am I doing here?

19:17.760 --> 19:21.599
You were in an accident.
The rescue squad brought you in.

19:24.184 --> 19:25.853
I can't remember.

19:26.770 --> 19:29.857
You were wearing
a Wonder Woman costume...

19:29.940 --> 19:32.026
and trying to help some kid.

19:34.194 --> 19:37.699
How many people know?
I mean, about what happened to me?

19:39.242 --> 19:41.953
You made the noon report
on Channel Two.

19:43.747 --> 19:45.039
Oh, no.

19:46.708 --> 19:48.835
Are you in trouble, Nancy?

19:51.171 --> 19:55.509
- Get lost, okay?
- Come on, Nancy. Let me help you.

20:02.182 --> 20:06.395
Somebody tried to kill you right after
you were brought in this morning.

20:07.772 --> 20:09.941
- Kill me?
- Yeah.

20:13.320 --> 20:14.571
Percy...

20:16.406 --> 20:18.908
- wants me dead.
- Percy?

20:20.452 --> 20:23.288
- Who's Percy?
- Oh, just get lost.

20:25.708 --> 20:28.711
Tell me what kind of trouble you're in.
I can help.

20:28.794 --> 20:32.923
- I'd do anything to help you.
- You are such a jerk. You really are.

20:33.841 --> 20:37.219
- What, for caring about you?
- You don't even know me.

20:39.723 --> 20:41.891
Let me tell you something, turkey.

20:41.975 --> 20:44.644
You know why I got that modeling job?

20:44.728 --> 20:46.563
You know why they hired me?

20:46.646 --> 20:50.191
- Because you're a beautiful girl.
- Because I got a record.

20:50.275 --> 20:52.610
Check forgery and shoplifting.

20:52.694 --> 20:55.739
They figured anybody desperate enough
to break the law once...

20:55.822 --> 20:57.867
wouldn't mind doing it again.

21:02.747 --> 21:04.373
They were right.

21:05.833 --> 21:07.793
How does that grab you?

21:09.879 --> 21:13.133
My brother's been busted three times
for marijuana.

21:16.428 --> 21:20.682
Just get out of here, please.
My head feels like it's going to burst.

21:21.224 --> 21:23.602
I'll tell the doctor.

21:24.728 --> 21:26.354
Just leave.

21:28.106 --> 21:31.610
No matter what you say,
whatever mess you're in...

21:31.694 --> 21:34.238
I'm going to help get you out of it.

21:36.949 --> 21:40.411
I wish you liked yourself
half as much as I like you.

21:56.303 --> 21:57.429
Jerk.

22:57.367 --> 22:58.743
Hold it!

23:10.214 --> 23:12.592
Just how many stories did she fall?

23:13.676 --> 23:15.761
Marvelous. No.

23:16.053 --> 23:19.348
Mr. Roman will contact you
and arrange for your pay.

23:20.474 --> 23:22.227
And good day to you.

23:32.279 --> 23:35.740
Pity your colleague
had to come to such a dreadful end.

23:36.533 --> 23:40.162
But life goes on, and you have work to do.

23:41.289 --> 23:45.751
Such as helping me steal several
million dollars' worth of jewels and furs...

23:45.835 --> 23:48.379
from the cream of Washington society.

24:06.440 --> 24:08.358
- Fred Roman?
- Yeah?

24:08.442 --> 24:10.069
I'm Diana Prince.

24:11.946 --> 24:15.241
- Thanks, George.
- IADC.

24:16.409 --> 24:18.411
I expected to see someone else.

24:18.494 --> 24:22.999
What you mean, don't you, is that
I'm the last person you expected to see.

24:23.082 --> 24:25.418
I had this little problem getting here.

24:25.501 --> 24:28.255
Almost as if someone didn't want me
to get here at all.

24:28.338 --> 24:31.258
Look, I got things to do.
What is it you want?

24:31.341 --> 24:34.386
Well, I got your name from the owner
of a costume shop.

24:34.469 --> 24:37.764
That's where I was, by the way,
when I had this little problem.

24:38.265 --> 24:39.725
The bottom line?

24:39.808 --> 24:43.771
I understand the shop made several
Wonder Woman costumes for you.

24:43.855 --> 24:45.022
Why?

24:45.106 --> 24:47.441
I spend part of the time
teaching acrobatics...

24:47.525 --> 24:50.695
and the other part arranging for
Wonder Woman to show up at parties.

24:50.778 --> 24:52.947
You train girls to appear as Wonder
Woman?

24:53.030 --> 24:55.533
I teach them the stunts,
they wear the costumes.

24:55.616 --> 24:58.537
We all make a living.
You got some kind of problem with that?

24:58.620 --> 24:59.788
No.

24:59.871 --> 25:03.375
A girl wearing one of those costumes
was hospitalized this morning.

25:03.709 --> 25:07.462
Nancy Clark. I heard about that. Too bad.

25:07.754 --> 25:11.258
What's worse is that while she was there,
somebody tried to kill her.

25:12.968 --> 25:14.929
Someone about your size.

25:15.263 --> 25:19.142
Apparently he was afraid of what she
might say if she regained consciousness.

25:24.564 --> 25:28.234
That's all very interesting,
but I got a living to make, okay?

25:28.609 --> 25:32.573
Okay. When I see Nancy tomorrow,
I'll be sure to give her your best.

25:32.656 --> 25:34.324
Yeah, you do that.

25:46.253 --> 25:49.632
Come on, let's get started.
You got a lot to do tomorrow night.

26:08.318 --> 26:10.404
Four beats to curtain.

26:10.487 --> 26:13.824
Five, six, seven, eight.

26:19.580 --> 26:22.083
Very nice. Very nice, indeed.

26:22.500 --> 26:25.169
Remember those guns
are part of your lifestyle.

26:25.253 --> 26:26.879
Think '20s.

26:31.843 --> 26:35.597
Yes, switch the gun and sit here.

26:37.057 --> 26:38.684
Very good.

26:40.102 --> 26:41.395
Yes, that's nice.

26:44.565 --> 26:48.652
Sit and drape. Very nice, indeed.

26:49.695 --> 26:52.031
Excuse me. Yes, I like that.

26:52.740 --> 26:55.368
Leslie, you go first.

26:56.828 --> 27:00.206
Five, six, seven, eight.

27:07.423 --> 27:10.592
Leslie, that's your first position.
Now, Karen, we'll...

27:16.223 --> 27:18.767
- It's broken, sir.
- Just relax, everybody...

27:18.851 --> 27:21.353
while our mechanical wizard
earns his keep.

27:21.436 --> 27:24.691
Fortunately, dear fellow, I have
four more tapes just like that one.

27:24.774 --> 27:27.193
- Now you're the one looking bedraggled.
- Not at all.

27:27.277 --> 27:29.904
You just witnessed the reason
why rehearsals were invented.

27:29.988 --> 27:31.823
- Excuse me, John.
- Oh, Steve.

27:31.906 --> 27:34.617
Mr. Percy, Col. Steve Trevor.
Steve, Edgar Percy.

27:34.701 --> 27:35.952
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

27:36.035 --> 27:38.413
This is the man responsible
for what's happening onstage.

27:38.496 --> 27:41.834
- Really. What a delightful responsibility.
- Indeed.

27:41.917 --> 27:43.293
What do you think?

27:43.377 --> 27:46.088
There's no question about it.
You need professional help.

27:46.171 --> 27:49.508
What do you suggest,
a platoon at every door?

27:49.591 --> 27:54.096
No. What I suggest is that you limit access
to the room to one door...

27:54.179 --> 27:57.934
and everybody going through it will be
screened electronically for weapons...

27:58.017 --> 28:00.812
and allow a few of my agents
to circulate during the party.

28:00.895 --> 28:02.355
This is a sit-down dinner.

28:02.438 --> 28:04.607
I can't have your men eyeing everybody.

28:04.732 --> 28:06.693
- Nobody will-
- Excuse me.

28:07.151 --> 28:10.238
I take it you're discussing
how to keep undesirables...

28:10.321 --> 28:13.367
- out of tomorrow night's affair?
- Something like that, yes.

28:13.450 --> 28:16.078
As you know, my models
and I have entertained...

28:16.161 --> 28:19.248
wealthy and influential people
many, many times.

28:19.498 --> 28:21.375
In several instances...

28:21.458 --> 28:25.796
security guards kept a discreet eye
on the guests while posing as waiters.

28:29.008 --> 28:33.471
- Three agents, in uniforms I'll provide.
- You got it. That's a good idea.

28:33.555 --> 28:36.015
I'll have the scanner delivered
tomorrow afternoon.

28:36.099 --> 28:39.936
Mr. Percy, I realize that
these guns on stage are props...

28:40.019 --> 28:42.605
- but we'll still want to check them out.
- Of course.

28:42.689 --> 28:45.776
But we will see you here tomorrow night,
won't we, Colonel?

28:45.859 --> 28:47.695
My men can handle it without me.

28:47.778 --> 28:50.781
No, Steve, if you're not here
it's no go on any of this.

28:52.783 --> 28:55.828
All right. I'll be here.
If I get to sit at the front table.

28:55.911 --> 28:58.288
- No problem.
- Nice meeting you, Mr. Percy.

28:58.372 --> 29:00.708
- So long.
- Thanks, Steve.

29:00.792 --> 29:04.254
- The tape is ready, sir.
- All right. Excuse me, John.

29:04.337 --> 29:08.341
Places, everybody.
Exactly the same position you had before.

29:11.010 --> 29:12.887
Roll the tape, please.

29:22.523 --> 29:24.483
I'm not hiding anything.

29:25.234 --> 29:28.821
I was coming home from dress-rehearsing
some stunts at the gym.

29:28.904 --> 29:33.159
I was supposed to play Wonder Woman
at some guy's birthday party on Sunday.

29:35.161 --> 29:39.040
Then why is it that somebody tried
to kill you?

29:39.332 --> 29:42.335
- And me, for that matter.
- I don't know.

29:43.336 --> 29:46.172
- Somebody made a mistake.
- About both of us?

29:46.256 --> 29:49.093
Look, you're just picking on me
because I got a record.

29:49.176 --> 29:50.719
I make a couple of mistakes...

29:50.803 --> 29:54.306
and all of a sudden I'm open game
for anybody with a fancy ID.

29:54.390 --> 29:57.768
Oh yeah, sure. Badger her,
call her a liar, she's used to it.

29:59.186 --> 30:00.813
Well, I'm not.

30:02.022 --> 30:03.357
I'm sorry.

30:04.149 --> 30:07.696
After all, you are here
because you saved a child's life.

30:08.905 --> 30:11.116
Doubt if I ever do that again.

30:14.327 --> 30:17.122
So, you make your living modeling?

30:17.997 --> 30:20.835
Supposed to be the best way
to get into acting.

30:20.918 --> 30:23.295
More like the best way to be broke
all the time.

30:23.379 --> 30:24.839
Do you have an agent?

30:24.922 --> 30:27.967
No, what work I get comes from
going over the want ads.

30:28.050 --> 30:30.052
I'm trying to build up my connections.

30:30.135 --> 30:32.221
Is that how you got the job
playing Wonder Woman?

30:32.304 --> 30:33.347
Yeah.

30:33.430 --> 30:35.933
Caught my eye as soon as I opened
the paper.

30:36.016 --> 30:39.312
"Big money.
Opportunity for tall, athletic... "

30:42.691 --> 30:45.402
They offered you big money?
For a birthday party?

30:46.528 --> 30:48.905
No, I was thinking of another ad.

30:49.322 --> 30:52.742
The Wonder Woman job, I got that
through a friend. That was it.

30:53.410 --> 30:55.454
Nancy, the people that hired you...

30:55.538 --> 30:59.166
they want you to think that just because
you made some bad decisions once...

30:59.250 --> 31:02.211
you don't know how to make good ones.
But that's not true.

31:02.294 --> 31:05.256
You proved it yourself
when you saved that little boy's life.

31:08.008 --> 31:10.929
My head is killing me. I can't talk anymore.

31:15.308 --> 31:16.476
Okay.

31:18.895 --> 31:21.064
I'll have the doctor look in on you.

31:39.833 --> 31:41.670
Wait a second, miss.

31:41.753 --> 31:44.339
Could you tell me
where I can find Mr. Percy?

31:44.422 --> 31:47.425
He's staying at the hotel,
but I have no idea which room.

31:48.969 --> 31:52.013
Didn't I see you
hanging around the stage last night?

31:52.555 --> 31:55.892
Yeah. I work for the hotel. Night shift.

31:56.643 --> 32:00.231
I would have talked to Mr. Percy then,
but he was always too busy.

32:00.314 --> 32:03.192
Well, he'll be back tonight for the show,
that's for sure.

32:03.275 --> 32:06.028
Excuse me. I have to go backstage
and try some costumes.

32:06.112 --> 32:08.656
Wait a second. Maybe you can help me.

32:08.739 --> 32:11.450
I wanted to ask him about Nancy Clark.

32:13.494 --> 32:16.665
You know, the girl he hired to play
Wonder Woman?

32:17.958 --> 32:19.960
That's her name, Nancy.

32:20.544 --> 32:22.128
What about her?

32:23.797 --> 32:25.799
Look, see she's my girl.

32:26.132 --> 32:29.302
And I just wanted to know
what Percy hired her for.

32:29.386 --> 32:31.389
- She didn't tell you?
- No.

32:34.141 --> 32:38.062
See, she wanted me to be surprised,
but I'd really rather know now.

32:39.188 --> 32:41.732
Far be it from me to ruin a surprise.

32:41.816 --> 32:44.610
Just keep your eyes peeled
during the speakeasy routine.

32:54.663 --> 32:56.039
Come in.

32:57.707 --> 32:59.876
- Very nice, Mr. Percy.
- Thank you.

33:00.502 --> 33:04.006
The IADC agents that Trevor sent over
are tied up in a store room.

33:04.090 --> 33:06.175
- Here's their ID cards.
- Good.

33:06.258 --> 33:09.178
Now we simply wait
for the Colonel himself to show.

33:10.513 --> 33:12.306
Is Wonder Woman well rehearsed?

33:12.390 --> 33:14.892
She'll do fine.
She's waiting for you to make her up.

33:14.975 --> 33:17.561
Well, despite your blunder
at the hospital...

33:17.978 --> 33:21.525
and despite Diana Prince's knack
for staying alive...

33:21.608 --> 33:25.195
we'll soon be on our way to South
America, several million dollars richer.

33:26.112 --> 33:28.240
Not a bad way to retire, Mr. Percy.

33:28.323 --> 33:30.700
For years, I've been famous for creating...

33:30.784 --> 33:33.745
some of the most beautiful faces
in the world.

33:34.246 --> 33:36.707
But the only thing
I'll be famous for tomorrow...

33:36.791 --> 33:39.502
is pulling off the most unique heist
in history.

33:40.544 --> 33:42.588
What makes it even better, Mr. Percy...

33:42.672 --> 33:45.716
is that the people you'll be robbing
are the beautiful people.

33:46.217 --> 33:48.719
Well said, dear boy. Well said.

34:01.858 --> 34:04.861
Look at you. And I didn't even know
you were engaged.

34:04.945 --> 34:07.156
I'm not getting married, I'm going to work.

34:07.240 --> 34:08.366
Come on.

34:08.449 --> 34:12.245
John Austin asked me to give him a hand
with the party at the Myerton tonight.

34:12.954 --> 34:16.498
- Yes, the threatening phone calls.
- And security in general.

34:16.581 --> 34:19.835
The combined income of the guests
he's gonna have there tonight...

34:19.918 --> 34:22.170
would probably rival the national treasury.

34:22.420 --> 34:25.007
What's new on the Nancy Clark thing?

34:25.092 --> 34:27.511
I'm having Ira run down
the newspaper ad...

34:27.594 --> 34:29.679
she answered to get that
Wonder Woman job.

34:29.763 --> 34:32.056
- I thought you were going to talk to her.
- I did.

34:32.139 --> 34:33.766
And I'm more convinced than ever...

34:33.850 --> 34:37.312
that she's involved in
something very big and very bad.

34:37.687 --> 34:41.234
- If you need me, I'll be at the Myerton.
- Wait a second.

34:41.317 --> 34:44.946
Why is it that you're leaving
and it's only 3:30 in the afternoon?

34:45.029 --> 34:48.032
- Lots of arrangements to make.
- I wouldn't hurry, Steve.

34:48.114 --> 34:51.744
I doubt that any of Percy's models
can get free until after the show.

34:52.870 --> 34:55.581
Why, Diana,
whatever could you be talking about?

35:07.719 --> 35:09.763
Col. Trevor? Bob Roberts.

35:09.846 --> 35:12.225
John Austin asked me
to keep an eye out for you.

35:12.308 --> 35:15.728
Wanted me to point out a fire exit that
might give us a problem tonight.

35:15.812 --> 35:18.147
- You care to take a look?
- Sure. Lead the way.

35:48.471 --> 35:50.306
- Hello, Rover.
- Hello, Diana.

35:50.681 --> 35:53.559
- Got something for me, I hope?
- Sure do.

36:00.901 --> 36:02.027
Good.

36:09.618 --> 36:13.538
Great. Not a completely wasted
Saturday afternoon.

36:14.706 --> 36:18.461
This has got to be the ad she answered.
It might even have tempted me.

36:19.337 --> 36:20.797
Good old Ira.

36:24.342 --> 36:26.135
Four-four-nine-two.

36:26.803 --> 36:30.640
Yes, I'm sorry. I completely blanked out
on who I was calling.

36:31.474 --> 36:33.977
Do you wish to leave a message
for Mr. Percy?

36:34.061 --> 36:35.229
Percy?

36:36.063 --> 36:39.483
Percy, yes. Edgar Percy.

36:41.652 --> 36:44.029
Yes, what is the message, please?

36:44.988 --> 36:48.159
Well, never mind. I'm sorry.
I'll just try later.

36:55.541 --> 36:58.795
Looks like I'll be going
to that fashion show, too.

37:18.732 --> 37:22.362
- How goes it, Colonel?
- Just fine. Look.

37:25.365 --> 37:27.617
Confiscated from three of our guests.

37:27.700 --> 37:30.036
I explained it was for their own good,
of course.

37:30.119 --> 37:33.956
Of course. Unfortunately, one can
hardly argue with the IADC.

37:34.582 --> 37:37.878
- How about the guns up on stage?
- Loaded and ready.

37:39.046 --> 37:42.049
Well, I think I should go to my room.

37:42.132 --> 37:45.636
Make myself comfortable. See you shortly.

37:53.645 --> 37:57.065
How about some hors d'oeuvres, Steve?
I saved you that table up front.

37:57.148 --> 38:00.693
No, I'm not hungry.
Besides, I can't do my job sitting down.

38:00.777 --> 38:03.404
Well, you're the boss.
Are you getting a cold?

38:03.488 --> 38:05.323
You're sounding awfully funny.

38:05.406 --> 38:09.495
No, it's just a little sore throat.
Another reason for keeping my distance.

38:09.578 --> 38:12.081
- Okay. I'll talk to you later.
- Yeah.

38:47.993 --> 38:49.328
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:49.411 --> 38:51.080
Talked to Mr. Percy yet?

38:51.163 --> 38:54.833
No, I thought I'd wait till after
the speakeasy number.

38:55.292 --> 38:56.960
Won't be long now.

39:07.138 --> 39:10.850
That kid's still hanging around,
the one I told you was asking questions.

39:10.934 --> 39:12.518
- Where?
- There.

39:26.158 --> 39:29.078
Todd? What are you doing here?

39:29.161 --> 39:33.208
I'm trying to find out what kind of trouble
Nancy is in so I can get her out of it.

39:33.917 --> 39:36.753
Something really big is going to happen
out there tonight.

39:36.836 --> 39:39.506
I know, but I have no idea what.

39:39.797 --> 39:43.468
I can tell you one thing.
Whatever it is, it's not going to be good.

39:43.551 --> 39:47.306
I can tell you another thing
and it's not going to be pleasant.

39:47.389 --> 39:48.849
Not for you two.

40:01.821 --> 40:03.823
You've all been looking forward to this...

40:03.907 --> 40:06.785
so I won't waste your time
with a long introduction.

40:06.868 --> 40:09.496
On behalf of our hostess,
Mrs. Havenhurst...

40:14.167 --> 40:16.294
and the Myerton Hotel...

40:17.670 --> 40:21.008
I present, "Fashions That Made
the Twenties Roar"...

40:21.091 --> 40:23.677
featuring the Edgar Percy models.

40:32.644 --> 40:33.854
Hold it.

40:34.773 --> 40:36.858
I wanna watch the show, don't you?

41:15.023 --> 41:16.733
Cut the tape, please.

41:19.194 --> 41:20.987
I said, cut the tape.

41:27.036 --> 41:30.998
Yes, this gun is real and it's loaded.
So are theirs.

41:32.416 --> 41:36.295
Please remain in your seats.
Don't move and don't talk.

41:36.545 --> 41:40.050
Just kindly turn all your valuables
over to my friends.

41:53.021 --> 41:54.982
Now, move it. Come on.

42:15.337 --> 42:16.755
Let's go, lady. Let's go.

42:34.148 --> 42:36.150
All right, hold it. It's all over.

42:36.233 --> 42:38.611
The men dressed as waiters
are my agents.

42:38.819 --> 42:42.156
My men will collect the bag.
Start collecting, that's it.

42:42.239 --> 42:44.743
Everybody just stay seated, just stay calm.

42:44.826 --> 42:48.496
Everything will be all right.
Everything is under control.

42:48.580 --> 42:52.042
Just remain calm. The rest
of you people, drop your weapons.

42:54.753 --> 42:56.963
Now, just stay calm, keep your seat.

42:57.047 --> 43:00.426
Thanks to Wonder Woman, we're all safe.
The police have been sent for.

43:01.218 --> 43:04.430
The items taken from you will be
taken down to police headquarters.

43:04.513 --> 43:07.683
You'll get them back as soon as we've
photographed the evidence.

43:09.351 --> 43:11.937
Call the police, don't worry about that. Go.

43:12.021 --> 43:14.857
Everything will be returned
as quickly as possible.

43:15.525 --> 43:17.152
Now, just be calm...

43:17.235 --> 43:19.738
while Wonder Woman and my men
will remove these people...

43:19.821 --> 43:21.823
so they don't bother you anymore.

43:28.121 --> 43:31.207
Transportation will be provided
to take you down to headquarters...

43:31.291 --> 43:33.210
where you can identify your valuables.

43:48.852 --> 43:51.062
Real bullets this time, Wonder Woman.

44:17.923 --> 44:20.052
So that would've been Nancy out there...

44:20.135 --> 44:23.638
playing Wonder Woman and helping them
get away with all those valuables.

44:23.722 --> 44:25.599
Maybe not. She might've...

44:25.682 --> 44:27.726
- Steve. You okay?
- Yeah.

44:27.809 --> 44:30.562
Another lump on the head
to go along with my collection.

44:30.645 --> 44:32.856
But look who I found waiting in his room...

44:32.939 --> 44:36.402
- unaware that his plans had gone astray.
- They shouldn't have gone astray.

44:36.485 --> 44:39.447
I had everything planned,
down to the tiniest detail.

44:39.530 --> 44:42.658
Except you forgot to take one thing
into account, Mr. Percy.

44:42.742 --> 44:44.994
A police record doesn't make
a person all bad.

44:45.077 --> 44:48.956
If Nancy hadn't stopped to save that child,
you wouldn't be on your way to prison.

44:49.040 --> 44:51.334
Which reminds me,
I've got a phone call to make.

44:51.417 --> 44:53.795
- Thanks for everything.
- So do I.

44:53.879 --> 44:55.255
So do I.

44:55.338 --> 44:58.550
I'll make reservations for two
at the Chateau Lafite.

44:58.633 --> 45:00.051
What's the occasion?

45:00.135 --> 45:03.180
You don't think I'm letting this tuxedo
go to waste, do you?

45:40.010 --> 45:41.095
