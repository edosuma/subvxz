03:01.048 --> 03:05.844
How are you holding?
- I'm fine. I'm not the one who is sick.

03:06.178 --> 03:08.959
Your sister isn't
reacting to the treatment.

03:09.815 --> 03:13.712
We're doing everything we
can, but chances are...

03:15.980 --> 03:20.496
Amy is a fighter.
She will fight this thing.

03:35.883 --> 03:41.297
Amy Tyler. 8 years old.
Safe with Mommy and Daddy in Heaven.

04:13.037 --> 04:15.080
I don't have good news I'm afraid.

04:15.956 --> 04:19.874
You've developed chronic B cell
lymphocytic lymphoma.  It's...

04:19.975 --> 04:21.075
I know what it is.

04:21.879 --> 04:27.051
- It took my mom, my sister.
- We can give you chemo.

05:53.262 --> 05:54.671
Fuck you.

06:32.760 --> 06:36.873
Veronica, I reviewed your new test.

06:37.264 --> 06:38.736
I have some major news.

06:38.737 --> 06:41.660
What?  I have given
myself an extra month to live?

06:41.936 --> 06:45.898
No.
You are in complete remission.

06:49.944 --> 06:53.864
- You're serious?
- Very serious.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.774
Thank you.

07:27.481 --> 07:29.316
Only one may win.

07:32.278 --> 07:33.988
The school.

07:34.023 --> 07:37.785
The house and the prison are safe.

07:38.784 --> 07:42.112
Follow the arrows, or you will die.

07:42.621 --> 07:46.292
Stay on the path, or you will die.

07:47.334 --> 07:50.504
If you were locked twice, you will die.

07:53.924 --> 07:55.926
Do not touch the grass...

07:56.760 --> 07:58.304
or you will die.

08:04.560 --> 08:07.021
Race or die.

08:07.062 --> 08:08.790
What the fuck?

08:58.864 --> 09:00.420
Come on.

09:06.330 --> 09:07.623
Come on, man. Wake up.

09:08.165 --> 09:10.054
Come on, wake up.
Come on, come on.

09:13.379 --> 09:15.042
Come on.

10:44.929 --> 10:49.725
A chosen training, I'd rather die.

10:51.362 --> 10:55.252
No. Dying is overvalued.

11:02.238 --> 11:04.067
What's your name?

11:05.950 --> 11:11.502
- Eddie.
- Justin. Good to meet you, Ed.

11:13.332 --> 11:19.399
Better to meet you.
Most men would have left me to die.

11:22.258 --> 11:24.510
You do not have much
faith in human nature, huh?

11:27.888 --> 11:29.974
Don't.
It'll give us away.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.965
I feel she crawling on my legs.

11:32.978 --> 11:34.895
It's too dark until morning.

11:35.271 --> 11:38.790
It's better to freeze to death,
than get our heads chopped off.

11:38.791 --> 11:40.580
You know what I mean?

11:51.370 --> 11:54.707
- "Dust in the Wind."
- Huh, shut the fuck up.

11:55.749 --> 12:00.880
- I want them to play "Dust in the Wind '.
- Huh, that's a sad fuck song for a funeral.

12:01.573 --> 12:07.136
Yeah, what's the point. If you want them
to cry for you, is a guaranteed tearjerker.

12:09.221 --> 12:10.431
Four hours.

12:11.348 --> 12:13.566
- When the sun comes up.
- Then what.

12:13.667 --> 12:15.299
Then I'll get you out of here.

12:17.438 --> 12:21.317
For one day you will wake up with
someone who is prettier than me .

12:33.674 --> 12:35.372
- Hey, you on your way?
- Yeah.

12:36.290 --> 12:40.614
- You're supposed to be here in an hour.
- What?

12:41.670 --> 12:46.217
Where are you, man?  You have to
be here in an hour. Where are you?

12:46.550 --> 12:51.492
I don't know. That's what
girl's place look like, disco ball.

12:54.516 --> 12:57.307
Hey, guys.
Hold on, okay?

13:07.154 --> 13:10.866
- Where are you at? Up the bar from school?
- She had been here before too, huh?

13:11.116 --> 13:12.893
Is she hot?

13:23.295 --> 13:25.339
Yeah, dude, I'm in hell.

13:28.092 --> 13:30.519
You have reek of booze.
You sure you want me to come?

13:31.095 --> 13:33.287
Let me schedule.
The kid's won't mind.

13:33.288 --> 13:37.549
You ought to come, man.
They look up to you.

13:40.062 --> 13:42.982
All right, then I'll be there.
- All right, bye.

13:48.862 --> 13:50.698
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

13:51.198 --> 13:53.557
- All right. First one to the
entrance way wins, all right.

13:53.558 --> 13:54.839
- Deal.
- All right.

13:55.661 --> 13:58.122
Everyone, clear the hallway.

13:59.290 --> 14:02.293
- You know that I'm undefeated, right.
- I know.

14:03.127 --> 14:05.220
So if I lose, I clean
your wheels for a week.

14:05.321 --> 14:06.021
Yeah.

14:06.046 --> 14:09.174
You look a little nervous.
All right, relax, man.

14:10.092 --> 14:12.921
All right, Cody, are you ready?
Start us up buddy.

14:12.922 --> 14:16.068
- Ready to go.
- Yeah.

14:23.731 --> 14:27.443
Mr. Connor, this isn't
your private racetrack.

14:32.114 --> 14:34.096
Mr. Connor?

14:48.005 --> 14:50.299
If you want to do it,
simply do it.

14:51.133 --> 14:56.126
Don't listen to the outside world. Where
you can achieve what you want to achieve.

15:03.771 --> 15:05.189
Anyone have any questions?

15:06.857 --> 15:08.131
Ronnie?

15:08.859 --> 15:12.905
When you were in the war with
Mr Conner, did you ever kill anyone?

15:15.950 --> 15:20.287
We were there to help people.
And you only kill if you absolutely must.

15:20.829 --> 15:22.957
And luckily we
weren't in that situation.

15:23.707 --> 15:25.580
Seems like a good bunch
of kids you got there.

15:25.581 --> 15:26.752
Yeah, they are.

15:28.170 --> 15:29.216
How are you making out?

15:29.317 --> 15:31.565
Good.  Same shit,
different day, you know.

15:31.666 --> 15:32.666
Yeah.

15:32.883 --> 15:34.552
- Want to grab something to eat?
- Sure.

15:35.553 --> 15:41.845
So.  You saved me from some nightmares
torture, my friend. Thanks for the rescue.

15:42.268 --> 15:47.423
- Story of our lives, huh.
- She wasn't even like a bird or rodent.

15:47.465 --> 15:50.243
She was like this ugly
puffer fish, who just swam

15:50.256 --> 15:53.045
up from the deepest, darkest
depths of the ocean.

15:53.487 --> 15:55.756
How does a few drinks turn
Medusa into an angel?

15:55.757 --> 15:59.811
Your definition of a few drinks
maybe somewhat skewed.

16:00.911 --> 16:05.110
Bird or rodent.
What the hell does that mean?

16:05.833 --> 16:08.357
Have I never told you that before?
Birds or rodents. Women.

16:08.358 --> 16:11.529
If you look at them, you can trace
their lineage back to a bird or rodent.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.675
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, they either have like ...

16:14.925 --> 16:19.874
big toucan sam noses or little scrunched
up muskrat faces. I mean look at them, man.

16:20.175 --> 16:21.348
All right.

16:23.225 --> 16:24.560
How about her?

16:25.769 --> 16:29.023
- What you got?
- Her? She's a moo cow.

16:29.940 --> 16:32.067
She is no cow.

17:03.390 --> 17:07.185
They talking like cartoon cow.
You know. Cute.

17:07.435 --> 17:10.856
- So you'll find the cows?
- No, I would never take a cow to bed.

17:10.897 --> 17:14.967
In fact, knowing your facts
then, we slept together...

17:14.968 --> 17:17.507
I don't think you ever
kicked anyone out of bed.

17:17.863 --> 17:20.241
That's because our first
date was grand, you know.

17:21.407 --> 17:23.410
Lying under the stars.

17:27.414 --> 17:33.909
The school, the house
and the prison is safe.

17:34.505 --> 17:38.008
Follow the arrows,
or you will die.

17:38.342 --> 17:40.886
Stay on the path,
or you will die.

17:41.512 --> 17:45.307
If you are lapped twice, you will die.

17:49.311 --> 17:52.999
Do not touch the grass,
or you will die.

17:54.149 --> 17:56.777
Race or die.

17:57.903 --> 17:59.363
80.

18:02.116 --> 18:05.703
79, 78, 77...

18:09.999 --> 18:12.001
Race or die.

18:12.585 --> 18:16.458
Cannot.
I can't.

18:37.818 --> 18:40.362
Race or die.

18:48.875 --> 18:51.532
Can you tell me?

18:51.533 --> 18:52.533
76.

19:20.736 --> 19:25.512
Hold on. You saw what I saw, right?
I mean he stepped on the grass?

19:26.242 --> 19:27.701
- Yeah.
- 75.

19:27.952 --> 19:29.745
- Do you hear the numbers?
- Yup?

19:30.079 --> 19:32.498
How did it happen,
someone's head explode like that?

19:35.501 --> 19:36.424
What do you remember?

19:36.525 --> 19:39.417
Well, I was telling you about
the girl and the car and then...

19:39.838 --> 19:41.966
a bright white light,
and somehow we're here.

19:43.384 --> 19:47.149
Hey, anyone know where we are?
Do you know where we are?

19:57.273 --> 19:58.899
74.

20:38.647 --> 20:40.974
I don't see any cameras.  I don't
know how they are watching us.

20:40.975 --> 20:42.609
73.

20:42.943 --> 20:45.671
The voice in your head, that's
my voice you're hearing, right?

20:45.784 --> 20:47.823
- No, it's mine.

20:48.198 --> 20:49.744
Sure.

20:53.621 --> 20:55.178
- Let's go. What ....
- Come on, man.

20:55.179 --> 20:57.253
We don't have to listen to it.
We don't need to be sheep.

20:57.254 --> 21:00.028
It said that, if we're lapped, we die.

21:00.920 --> 21:04.448
There is a lot of people up ahead of us.
We'd better figure out what a lap is ...

21:04.449 --> 21:06.505
before we do anything else.

21:43.879 --> 21:45.422
72.

23:13.719 --> 23:17.021
- Hey, can you stop 'em?
- Hang on, no, no, I'm here to help.

23:17.022 --> 23:18.383
Let's get her up.

23:18.724 --> 23:23.479
Come on, get her up.
You guys speak English?

23:53.617 --> 23:57.443
It's going to be okay.
Hey, hey, look at me.

24:03.269 --> 24:05.014
We can take them with us.

24:08.232 --> 24:11.633
Yeah.
I think they are safer here.

24:13.529 --> 24:18.979
Look . We're gonna get some help.
I need you guys to stay here, okay?

24:19.869 --> 24:22.415
Stay here. We gonna
get you some help, okay?

24:24.456 --> 24:25.984
Stay.

24:49.565 --> 24:52.443
I need you to protect her, okay?
Protect her.

24:53.444 --> 24:59.184
Protect her, all right?
Look. Protect her, okay?

25:01.285 --> 25:03.295
Don't worry.

25:04.390 --> 25:05.600
It's gonna be okay.

25:06.874 --> 25:09.960
I'll get you some help.
Stay here.

25:12.129 --> 25:13.422
Protect her, okay?

25:15.472 --> 25:16.282
Stay there.

25:34.026 --> 25:38.362
Wait. Hold on a minute.
I can't leave them.

25:38.656 --> 25:41.450
Look, if we get lapped twice, we die.
And we're no good to anybody.

25:43.327 --> 25:45.062
It is a good move.

25:45.246 --> 25:47.557
- No man, we gotta do what is right.
- Just, listen to me.

25:47.558 --> 25:49.714
What is right, is you and I
get out of this in one piece.

25:49.959 --> 25:54.359
With those kids included. You know that.
We're wasting time just talking about this.

25:57.550 --> 25:59.291
Come on.

26:16.235 --> 26:17.820
71.

26:31.709 --> 26:34.628
- Why is he doing this, Just?
- Who?

26:34.920 --> 26:37.876
- God.
- God?

26:39.258 --> 26:41.588
- 70.
- You hear him speak to you?

26:43.345 --> 26:44.847
That ain't God.

26:46.432 --> 26:48.058
You don't have faith?

26:49.351 --> 26:51.816
You saw the white light.

26:53.522 --> 26:55.149
Do you have any idea where we are?

26:55.441 --> 26:57.985
- Purgatory.
- Purgatory?

26:59.236 --> 27:02.992
The Bible teaches, "Those who
find themselves in Purgatory '...

27:02.993 --> 27:05.870
must walk a narrow path to Heaven'

27:08.412 --> 27:10.706
- A narrow path.
- 69.

27:12.875 --> 27:14.335
Do you hear that?
-... 68.

27:14.370 --> 27:15.796
I hear my own voice.

27:16.378 --> 27:19.340
- He's testing us.
- 67.

27:19.506 --> 27:21.977
We must stay on the path
and not give in to temptation.

27:22.593 --> 27:27.471
If we continue on the path,
eventually we will reach Heaven.

27:28.349 --> 27:32.531
Temptation? Like step off the
path and your head explodes?

27:32.590 --> 27:35.550
Temptation that? Doesn't sound
too tempting to me, Father.  Sorry.

27:38.442 --> 27:40.694
God makes a journey for all of us.

27:42.738 --> 27:45.241
What do you guys say we keep moving.
Come on.

28:06.428 --> 28:08.222
66.

28:10.641 --> 28:12.309
65.

28:28.450 --> 28:31.495
Stay on the path or you will die.

28:36.584 --> 28:38.085
64.

28:56.754 --> 28:58.272
This is so fucked.

28:59.940 --> 29:02.985
- You just realize now?
- No, I mean, we're fucked.

29:11.827 --> 29:15.394
You're 37.
You're 38.

29:15.429 --> 29:16.749
And so many people have gone by?

29:18.751 --> 29:23.171
Relax.
Nice and easy. Come on.

29:27.176 --> 29:29.697
You know, if they lap
you again, you die, right?

29:31.513 --> 29:33.682
I'm familiar with that.

29:34.892 --> 29:39.844
Put it like this, I can't go
anywhere without this.

29:41.409 --> 29:43.349
Perhaps it's better.

29:44.860 --> 29:47.029
At one point you're going to die?

29:47.321 --> 29:50.501
Bullshit, nobody wants that.
Can you guys help?

29:54.506 --> 29:56.274
- What does she say?
- Thank you.

29:56.275 --> 29:58.475
They say they can't run forever.

29:59.058 --> 30:00.713
Woh, woh, woh, grab him.
Grab him.

30:05.656 --> 30:09.009
I think the house is after the next
tunnel.  Let's help them get there.

30:09.760 --> 30:11.720
Okay everyone.
We walk together, all right?

30:20.838 --> 30:23.502
We will wait back here and
give everyone a heads out.

30:24.189 --> 30:26.479
We want to take him out there
and make sure he is safe.

30:26.877 --> 30:29.824
Hey, make sure
no one gets through.

30:35.286 --> 30:37.016
It's going to be okay.

31:00.895 --> 31:02.440
Okay?

31:47.133 --> 31:49.818
- Are you a vet?
- Yeah.  Army.

31:51.028 --> 31:53.155
- Pussy.
- Excuse me?

31:53.530 --> 31:55.699
- I'm a Marine.
- Are you a Marine?

31:57.201 --> 32:00.682
I was knee high in my
dick's eye in goob blood...

32:00.683 --> 32:04.474
when you were just a
.. in your momma's womb.

32:06.502 --> 32:08.298
Nice to meet you.

32:12.216 --> 32:15.141
I learned a long time ago not to get

32:15.154 --> 32:18.090
too attached to people
in such situations.

32:18.764 --> 32:22.184
- They only leads to sadness.
- Bullshit!

32:26.480 --> 32:31.323
I can't.
I can't shake like a man, anymore.

32:33.445 --> 32:35.486
It's still there, Old timer.

32:41.829 --> 32:43.497
- I'm Thomas.
- Eddie.

32:46.542 --> 32:48.669
Race or die.

33:00.826 --> 33:06.079
Wherever you are, if you're
lapped twice, you will die.

33:16.614 --> 33:20.547
Everyone need to stop right here.
Everyone need stop right ....

33:28.542 --> 33:31.006
No one is moving from
this point on, you got me?

33:32.872 --> 33:34.881
I need you guys to slow done.
We're trying to get

33:34.894 --> 33:36.914
everybody to hold up right
here until we figure this out.

33:37.176 --> 33:40.251
You can stay in here, go
in to the other room,

33:40.264 --> 33:43.349
just don't past the guy
with one leg, okay?

33:43.682 --> 33:46.185
No, no ones getting through.

34:00.532 --> 34:03.744
- Relax, everyone stop in here.
- We can't stop, we must race.

34:03.911 --> 34:05.663
No one's going anywhere,
do you understand?

34:06.914 --> 34:08.197
Do you understand?

34:08.616 --> 34:11.168
If we continue to race,
people gonna die.

34:11.377 --> 34:14.755
There's an old man up there,
if you pass him, he's dead.

34:18.467 --> 34:19.676
I don't want this ...

34:20.010 --> 34:23.013
- Good.
- Race or Die ...

34:25.056 --> 34:26.391
Don't listen to that!

34:28.686 --> 34:31.105
If we work together
we can beat this thing.

34:42.658 --> 34:44.243
There is no fucking way out of here.

34:56.297 --> 34:57.581
I'll wait.

35:06.265 --> 35:07.600
60.

35:16.191 --> 35:19.194
- You don't let anyone through?
- You got that right, pal.

37:50.971 --> 37:52.214
Open it, please.

37:57.061 --> 37:58.337
Your wife?

38:02.733 --> 38:04.026
She was an angel.

38:12.159 --> 38:14.203
We all gonna die here, you know?

38:28.968 --> 38:31.011
What the fuck is he doing?

38:34.598 --> 38:37.893
- Why isn't somebody saying something?
- I think you've said enough.

38:38.286 --> 38:40.727
It's those assholes that are
probably behind all these.

38:40.740 --> 38:43.191
They're the ones that caused
all the trouble in the world.

38:43.211 --> 38:45.068
Sit down.
Relax.

38:45.859 --> 38:47.444
Fucking foreigners.

38:48.279 --> 38:50.531
Doesn't anybody know anything?

38:51.949 --> 38:55.452
What. Are we just staying
here until we starve?

38:55.953 --> 39:00.443
Don't you get it? If we just stay here
doing nothing, no food, no water...

39:00.444 --> 39:02.334
we are all as good as dead, anyway.

39:02.585 --> 39:03.972
You're free to go
wherever you want, lady.

39:03.973 --> 39:05.073
Yeah, just not that way?

39:05.087 --> 39:06.840
- Correct.
- Says who? You?

39:06.940 --> 39:10.175
Who the fuck put you in charge?

39:10.184 --> 39:12.067
Look. If you want that way,
go all the way back around.

39:12.068 --> 39:14.172
Who the fuck put you
in charge of my life?

39:14.173 --> 39:15.890
- Look.  Time to shut up lady.
- Or what?

39:15.931 --> 39:18.315
- Or I'll shut you up.
- Oh yeah, in front of all these people?

39:18.350 --> 39:22.485
You're damn right I will. You're not helping
anybody and I doubt you'll be missed.

39:30.779 --> 39:32.197
Fucking idiots.

39:43.083 --> 39:46.202
What is the word.  How do say
in American the female dog?

39:46.503 --> 39:47.450
Bitch.

39:47.498 --> 39:48.614
Bitch.

39:51.926 --> 39:56.171
My brother is an amputee.
He lost an arm to cancer.

40:06.841 --> 40:08.709
Can you spare one?

40:12.655 --> 40:13.872
Do you want it?

40:37.780 --> 40:44.186
They take away our mobiles, our money and
identification, they leave the cigarettes.

40:45.980 --> 40:49.562
- Yeah, I gotta take a piss, now.
- Go back and piss where we came in.

40:55.239 --> 40:57.294
Any reason why I think
you're picked for this thing?

40:57.395 --> 40:59.575
I don't know,
I'm a cyclist.

40:59.952 --> 41:04.281
- Cyclist?
- Yes,  the Tour de France, Tour de Europe.

41:04.957 --> 41:08.794
I have won them all, but why they would
put me here with people like you...

41:11.072 --> 41:13.016
Justin.

41:18.554 --> 41:20.055
58.

42:42.471 --> 42:44.306
You gonna die.

42:46.100 --> 42:48.352
Please don't.

43:43.274 --> 43:44.541
You got him?

43:45.951 --> 43:47.810
- The kids?
- Dead.

43:48.211 --> 43:50.333
We should have
brought them with us.

43:52.399 --> 43:55.244
- We can't save everyone.
- We should have fucking try.

45:04.146 --> 45:06.991
They are following the Yellow
Brick Road to Emerald City.

45:11.704 --> 45:13.289
The cowardly lion yawned...

45:15.249 --> 45:17.167
He was feeling tired.

45:24.300 --> 45:28.721
- He is gonna try to kill us all.
- But Dorothy knew they had to move on.

45:31.348 --> 45:35.237
If they didn't get to Emerald City,
they wouldn't meet the Wizard of Oz.

45:36.252 --> 45:38.582
And Dorothy couldn't get home.

45:42.484 --> 45:46.113
As Dorothy looked around
this very strange land...

45:47.072 --> 45:49.100
which at first scared her...

45:50.301 --> 45:55.414
she knew that with the help
of her friends, she...

46:15.184 --> 46:18.562
- How far along are you?
- Eight months.

46:19.271 --> 46:21.440
Is it a boy or a girl?

46:23.025 --> 46:25.611
I don't know, I chose not to.

46:29.406 --> 46:31.242
They have names?

46:32.718 --> 46:39.213
For a boy: Aizeah.
For a girl: Erica.

46:42.127 --> 46:43.963
Do you want to feel?

47:06.110 --> 47:07.695
I can feel it kicking.

47:10.739 --> 47:14.410
- He wants to come out.
- It won't be long now.

47:21.166 --> 47:22.656
Where did everyone go?

47:23.057 --> 47:27.265
They are all behind me, chasing me.
They'll be here soon.

47:41.186 --> 47:42.454
I'm sorry...

47:44.481 --> 47:47.026
I will not put my life in
anyone else's hands.

47:48.777 --> 47:51.196
I might pass you maybe
for a second time.

47:53.157 --> 47:56.026
- I'm sorry.
- No, please. Don't.

47:56.061 --> 47:58.495
- You won't feel anything.
- Don't.

47:59.121 --> 48:01.332
No, you don't have to.

48:03.751 --> 48:07.046
There's no place like home,
there's no place like ....

48:33.239 --> 48:36.325
Wait.

48:36.909 --> 48:39.912
I think I just slipped
on a baby's hand.

48:40.496 --> 48:43.290
- We gotta catch this guy, old man.
- Fuck that.

48:45.042 --> 48:46.318
Get them.

48:59.342 --> 49:03.143
Stay here. You gotta to stay here.
You cannot go ...

49:13.037 --> 49:14.530
Fucking dig it.

49:37.553 --> 49:40.598
Come on, die, die already.
Fuck!

49:41.181 --> 49:42.725
39.

49:46.312 --> 49:48.230
Let's grasp their ass.

49:49.148 --> 49:51.780
Wait here, let everyone
through, if anyone

49:51.793 --> 49:54.236
gets away and comes
back, you smoke 'em.

49:54.653 --> 49:57.907
- I wanna come with you guys.
- Stay the fuck there.

50:32.983 --> 50:34.526
38.

50:50.167 --> 50:51.368
37.

50:57.277 --> 51:00.052
36. 35.

51:04.473 --> 51:05.724
34.

51:10.229 --> 51:12.273
- Nice.
- 33.

51:21.156 --> 51:22.992
Allahu Akbar.

51:25.703 --> 51:27.079
Bye bye.

52:18.439 --> 52:21.175
What the fuck is wrong
with these people?

52:25.262 --> 52:28.891
Six vodkas, seven beers...  having a piss
since we left that school this morning.

52:28.892 --> 52:32.543
- Jesus, I hate that man. Come on.
- Oh my God.

52:38.751 --> 52:40.554
I don't want to slow
music at my funeral, I

52:40.567 --> 52:43.280
want something fast pace, man.
Some rock and roll.

52:50.688 --> 52:52.581
Fast as the girls I'm chasing.

52:54.959 --> 52:56.782
Yeah, you play at my funeral.
How does that sound? You

52:56.795 --> 52:58.629
taking notes, because you
write my obituary, bro.

52:58.963 --> 53:02.822
I'm a crippled baby,
pooping in my diaper.

53:02.823 --> 53:03.823
27.

53:19.817 --> 53:24.363
I am a crippled baby,
pooping in my diaper.

54:18.250 --> 54:19.993
- 26.
- Oh, fuck.

54:35.184 --> 54:36.393
25.

55:45.462 --> 55:47.131
24.

55:49.758 --> 55:51.026
23.

59:31.564 --> 59:34.316
16. 15.

01:00:54.897 --> 01:00:56.732
14.

01:03:43.357 --> 01:03:46.151
Eight, seven, six.

01:11:04.882 --> 01:11:06.675
Five.

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:06.236
Three.

01:15:30.814 --> 01:15:32.049
Two.

01:15:32.608 --> 01:15:37.029
Relax.
I am not going hurt you.

01:15:38.322 --> 01:15:40.174
You can read my lips, right?

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:46.163
Okay, I'm not going to hurt you.

01:15:47.998 --> 01:15:50.125
I'm not going to hurt you.
I'm not.

01:15:54.447 --> 01:15:56.048
Do you know what that is?

01:16:28.789 --> 01:16:32.409
Hey, hey. I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

01:16:38.090 --> 01:16:39.466
Angels.

01:16:42.553 --> 01:16:44.179
Angels?

01:16:47.333 --> 01:16:49.810
It looks like they're being tortured.

01:16:53.898 --> 01:16:57.443
They fly above these banks
until they can't fly any longer.

01:17:00.571 --> 01:17:03.324
Why is God doing this to us?

01:17:05.117 --> 01:17:06.376
And them.

01:18:44.884 --> 01:18:46.085
1.

01:19:01.609 --> 01:19:05.279
- Now what?
- Congratulations, winner.

01:19:06.322 --> 01:19:07.573
Who are you?

01:19:13.746 --> 01:19:15.080
Who are you?

01:19:22.338 --> 01:19:24.215
Who the fuck are you?

01:19:26.675 --> 01:19:28.427
We are Acerod.

01:19:33.599 --> 01:19:37.561
Acerod ?
What the fuck is Acerod?

01:19:39.396 --> 01:19:43.859
- We are Acerod.
- Where the fuck am I?

01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:49.073
You are in our human arena.

01:20:08.801 --> 01:20:10.928
Congratulations, winner.

01:20:11.845 --> 01:20:14.807
You will represent the human race.

01:20:20.938 --> 01:20:27.194
While no human has ever survived, you have
shown you will not die without a fight.

01:20:28.779 --> 01:20:32.963
You wait until there is only
one from the Engelenras,

01:20:33.063 --> 01:20:36.582
the Argons and Milia troops.

01:20:37.288 --> 01:20:39.915
Until then you may rest.

01:20:49.049 --> 01:20:52.037
While you have little
chance from now on...

01:20:53.281 --> 01:20:56.511
we all wish you luck.

01:21:02.605 --> 01:21:03.831
Fuck you.

01:23:33.547 --> 01:23:37.112
Step on the veins, and you will die.

01:23:37.859 --> 01:23:41.789
Touch the fence in the
sky, and you will die.

01:23:42.681 --> 01:23:45.434
Win and live.

01:23:46.268 --> 01:23:48.687
Fight or die.
