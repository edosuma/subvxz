Well, hell, I just got off the boat.
Give me the scoop on Nicaragua.

19:35.548 --> 19:38.534
Well, about 60 years ago,
the U.S. Marines invaded

19:38.634 --> 19:41.412
to protect American business interests.

19:41.512 --> 19:44.499
They put down a small peasant revolt
led by a very small man

19:44.599 --> 19:46.375
wearing a giant cowboy hat
named Augusto Sandino.

19:46.475 --> 19:48.294
No, no, no, no.
I don't mean the peasant stuff.

19:48.394 --> 19:51.371
I mean the real stuff. Come on.

19:52.940 --> 19:54.926
Well, there are two kinds of beer.

19:55.026 --> 19:57.627
Toni and Victoria. Victoria's better.

19:58.404 --> 20:01.589
And two, watch out for Miss Panama.

20:01.949 --> 20:04.227
- Hot, hot, hot, but don't touch.
- No?

20:04.327 --> 20:06.979
She belongs to Tacho.

20:07.079 --> 20:09.774
And El Presidente has said
that if he catches anybody with her,

20:09.874 --> 20:12.360
- he will personally cut off the guy's...
- Pecker?

20:12.460 --> 20:15.113
Right. And throw it in Lake Managua.

20:15.213 --> 20:17.156
I know the tune

20:17.256 --> 20:19.700
Love, this is it

20:19.800 --> 20:21.619
You've heard it before

20:21.719 --> 20:23.663
You're gonna love this war, Russel.

20:23.763 --> 20:25.540
There's good guys,
bad guys and cheap shrimp.

20:25.640 --> 20:28.241
And Alex singing in the background.

20:30.561 --> 20:32.704
We've got to get alone somewhere.

20:34.774 --> 20:37.885
Around the New Year

20:37.985 --> 20:41.389
Now it's safe for lovers just to go

20:41.489 --> 20:44.058
Jesus, he's doing that on purpose.

20:44.158 --> 20:48.271
Alex is one of the world's experts
on military strategy, you know.

20:48.371 --> 20:52.098
Spring can really hang you up the most

21:06.347 --> 21:08.249
- Price!
- Regis!

21:08.349 --> 21:10.751
Congratulations on the African snaps.
They were marvelous.

21:10.851 --> 21:12.503
- Hello, Claire.
- Well, thank you.

21:12.603 --> 21:15.089
- Haven't seen you since...
- Three Mile Island?

21:15.189 --> 21:16.956
Yes. Holiday Inn, right?

21:17.900 --> 21:19.594
CLAIRE: Well, look who walked in.

21:19.694 --> 21:22.763
Oh. Before you fall in love, darling,
that's Marcel Jazy,

21:22.863 --> 21:25.433
friend of wine, women and Somoza.

21:25.533 --> 21:26.767
CLAIRE: Yeah, I know.

21:26.867 --> 21:29.395
He's also a businessman
in search of a business

21:29.495 --> 21:32.982
who doesn't try very hard to cover up
his connection to Washington.

21:33.082 --> 21:35.651
REGIS: I like his connection
in Nicaragua tonight.

21:35.751 --> 21:37.612
- But look at those moves.
- Yeah.

21:37.712 --> 21:40.855
CLAIRE: Can the C.I.A.
light cigarettes like that?

21:42.216 --> 21:44.234

Alex, it's Charlie from New York.

23:15.226 --> 23:19.422
He says a nightclub bombing isn't
big enough to hold for the World section.

23:19.522 --> 23:21.382
Tell him there were
pieces of body in the piano,

23:21.482 --> 23:24.260
and somebody was singing
Moonlight in Vermont.

23:24.360 --> 23:25.636
What's he got better than that?

23:25.736 --> 23:27.545
He's got the Pope in Egypt.

23:27.822 --> 23:29.339
Terrific.

23:34.745 --> 23:37.606
Forget the Pope, Charlie.
You got the Pope someplace every week.

23:37.706 --> 23:41.726
There's a big story down here, because
it's the first sign of fighting in Managua.

23:43.462 --> 23:46.240
Get a map, Charlie. Look up Nicaragua.

23:46.340 --> 23:49.577
You drive to New Orleans,
and then you turn left.

23:49.677 --> 23:51.454
Oh, like hell I'm editorializing.

23:51.554 --> 23:55.156
Look, the whole thing happened
in a room full of press and C.I.A.

23:55.683 --> 23:57.043
How do I know they were C.I.A?

23:57.143 --> 24:00.537
Because they wore nametags.
What do you think?

24:00.813 --> 24:02.631
Look, we're backing
a fascist government again.

24:02.731 --> 24:06.427
I know that's not exactly news,
but see if you can find an angle, huh?

24:06.527 --> 24:08.804
Alex, come on. You know,
there's fascist and there's fascist.

24:08.904 --> 24:11.891
Let's not go throwing words
like that around, okay?

24:11.991 --> 24:13.768
No, we don't have
any pictures of Rafael,

24:13.868 --> 24:16.020
because nobody knows
where the son of a bitch is.

look for him is gonna get his nuts shot off.

a point of view, too, right?

24:42.563 --> 24:44.372
- Right.
- Right.

I'm Hub Kittle.

24:52.198 --> 24:55.393
I need to know whether it's Russian
or Cuban-made guns were brought in.

If the guerrillas had help,
the war would have ended long time ago.

24:58.913 --> 25:00.648

28:06.684 --> 28:08.326
I'm sorry.

28:23.283 --> 28:25.519
Before you go,
there are some papers you will sign.

28:25.619 --> 28:27.021
What papers?

28:27.121 --> 28:29.180
Your visitation papers, Mr. Price.

28:30.249 --> 28:34.894
You were not arrested. You just came
to visit, in case your embassy asks.

28:35.796 --> 28:38.231
You want your passport back, yes?

28:46.056 --> 28:48.042
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

28:48.142 --> 28:49.376
How'd you know where to find me?

28:49.476 --> 28:51.545
Where else would I find you?
What happened?

28:51.645 --> 28:55.883
Oh, I was just visiting. Jazy was there.
I think he had me released.

28:55.983 --> 28:57.676
- Jazy? Think there's a story?
- Yeah.

28:57.776 --> 29:01.212
Oh, I don't know.
But it's a place to start looking.

29:02.322 --> 29:03.932
Looking for what?

29:04.032 --> 29:05.675
I'm gonna find Rafael.

29:11.039 --> 29:13.359
Now, Russel,
we have to be clever with Jazy.

29:13.459 --> 29:16.737
Hey, don't worry. I'm not gonna come
right out and ask him if he's a spy or not.

29:16.837 --> 29:17.937
(LAUGHING)

29:19.047 --> 29:20.866

29:20.966 --> 29:23.077

29:23.177 --> 29:25.454
Nobody's a spy anymore.

29:25.554 --> 29:27.748
Russel prefers pictures to words.

29:27.848 --> 29:30.709
You don't have to apologize.
You are journalists.

29:30.809 --> 29:32.086
And you're a businessman?

29:32.186 --> 29:33.786

29:34.396 --> 29:37.758
That sounds good.
Okay, I am a businessman.

but now it seems everyone knows who I am.

I have lunch with President Somoza

31:58.749 --> 32:03.028
to discuss security measures
against the Sandinista insurgents,

32:03.128 --> 32:06.657
and all he wants
to talk about is Miss Panama.

32:06.757 --> 32:09.117
He is worried about her.

32:09.217 --> 32:10.744
He thinks she's seeing another man?

32:10.844 --> 32:14.030
And he assigned me
to find out who the man is.

32:17.017 --> 32:18.117

Well, yeah, I was sunning myself
on the deck of the U.S.S. Pueblo

34:03.707 --> 34:06.485
when the North Koreans attacked
and I took a bullet right here in the chest.

34:06.585 --> 34:07.569
But, you see, I was lucky.

34:07.669 --> 34:10.822
I had a roll of high speed ektachrome
in my pocket right here over my heart.

and grazed your cheek and then...

34:14.342 --> 34:17.402
Yeah, saved my life.

Because Nicaragua
will soon be free, Mr. Price,

01:08:08.708 --> 01:08:11.528
we've decided that
it's time for you to meet Rafael.

01:08:11.628 --> 01:08:13.196
We need a photograph.

01:08:13.296 --> 01:08:15.699
You mean the Western press
needs a photograph.

We have momentum,
but many more lives will be lost.

Even Washington is starting to admit
that the butcher Somoza

01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:36.270
is not loved by his people.

01:09:36.962 --> 01:09:40.700
They have detained $25 million
in new arms shipments for Somoza

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:46.613
at an airfield in Florida until they find out
if Rafael is alive or dead.

01:09:47.765 --> 01:09:52.661
If Washington thinks Rafael is dead,
they will ship the arms to Somoza.

Enough of our people
have been lost already.

01:10:10.371 --> 01:10:13.348
We need to keep him alive

Do I go back and say
I missed the biggest story in the war?

01:11:49.304 --> 01:11:52.697
Do I go back and say
that I saw Rafael stone-cold dead?

01:11:58.187 --> 01:12:02.165
Or do I just say that we fell in love with
the guerrillas because their cause was...

01:12:05.903 --> 01:12:07.587
