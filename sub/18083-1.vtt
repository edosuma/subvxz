WEBVTT

00:11.359 --> 00:12.490
MAN: He'’s coming!

00:15.145 --> 00:16.712
Oh.

00:16.799 --> 00:18.366
Mr. Bullock is coming!

00:18.453 --> 00:20.324
Uh, excuse me, miss.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.418
Good morning, Mr. Bullock.

00:27.505 --> 00:29.029
Look alive, people!
Look alive!

00:29.116 --> 00:32.249
The rooster'’s in the henhouse!
Yeah? Yeah?

00:32.336 --> 00:34.730
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:36.297 --> 00:38.081
What is this?
What are you doing?

00:38.168 --> 00:39.909
I'’m drinking coffee.

00:39.996 --> 00:42.259
No, no, no. There'’s no time.
Mr. Bullock is on his way.

00:48.309 --> 00:49.701
Places, everyone!

00:55.098 --> 00:57.187
Why are these here?
Why isn'’t the tree decorated?

00:57.274 --> 00:59.885
I thought Lottie was supposed
to finish decorating the tree.

00:59.972 --> 01:01.191
Oh, my God, no.

01:01.278 --> 01:02.279
Mr. Bullock hates
incompleteness.

01:02.366 --> 01:03.933
This is terrible.

01:04.019 --> 01:05.500
He'’s gonna kill us all.
He'’s gonna murder me.

01:05.587 --> 01:07.893
If I go missing,
you tell my family I love them.

01:14.161 --> 01:16.554
- Merry Christmas.
- Get back to work.

01:18.121 --> 01:19.731
Oh! Good morning,
Mr. Bullock!

01:19.818 --> 01:21.472
Excuse me?

01:21.559 --> 01:23.996
I said good morning,
Mr. Bullock.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.998
I saved this one just for you.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.653
Oh. Well, that'’s--

01:28.740 --> 01:30.264
Oh, no!

01:30.351 --> 01:31.787
[Shatters]

01:31.874 --> 01:33.093
Darn.

01:35.530 --> 01:38.098

WOMAN: At the end of the day,

02:28.887 --> 02:31.107
we were able to intercept
the new shipment

02:31.194 --> 02:33.631
and divert the product
to a wholesale liquidator,

02:33.718 --> 02:36.112
who purchased all of the units
at a windfall price,

02:36.199 --> 02:39.985
allowing us to at least recover
our initial manufacturing costs.

02:40.072 --> 02:42.423
What was the impact
on human resources?

02:42.510 --> 02:44.947
Sadly, we had to lay off
all 150 employees,

02:45.034 --> 02:46.775
including the CEO,

02:46.862 --> 02:49.995
just prior to their Christmas
bonus checks being issued.

02:50.082 --> 02:52.346
You canceled
their Christmas bonus checks?

02:52.433 --> 02:54.086
My investment firm
won'’t like that.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.741
No. I included the bonus checks

02:56.828 --> 02:58.439
into their employee
severance package

02:58.526 --> 03:00.876
as a gesture of goodwill.

03:00.963 --> 03:02.878
The liquidation did, however,

03:02.965 --> 03:05.359
provide Bullock & Barnes
a substantial savings,

03:05.446 --> 03:09.145
which allowed us to recover our
initial investment into Flacco

03:09.232 --> 03:12.322
and realize a small profit
of 2.5 percent.

03:12.409 --> 03:16.413
Thank you, Riley.
Job well done.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.067
Thank you, sir.

03:18.154 --> 03:20.025
Others could benefit
by your example.

03:20.112 --> 03:21.984
Meeting adjourned.

03:29.252 --> 03:30.993
Could I have
my milkshake, please?

03:31.080 --> 03:33.952
Milkshake, yes, sir.
What kind?

03:34.039 --> 03:35.127
Tan-colored.

03:35.215 --> 03:39.088
T-Tan milkshake.
Yes, sir.

03:40.524 --> 03:42.613
Oh, when you'’re done here,

03:42.700 --> 03:44.615
swing by my office,
will you?

03:44.702 --> 03:46.748
I have something
I want to discuss with you.

03:46.835 --> 03:48.010
Yes, sir. Of course.

03:50.404 --> 03:53.494
Looks like you scored big.
Congratulations.

03:53.581 --> 03:54.625
Ms. McCormick.

03:54.712 --> 03:57.062
Please, just call me Dana.

03:57.149 --> 03:59.500
Of course, Dana.
Did you need to see me?

03:59.587 --> 04:02.154
Well, I just wanted to hang back
for a few extra minutes

04:02.242 --> 04:03.286
and talk to you.

04:03.373 --> 04:04.635
Talk to me about what?

04:04.722 --> 04:06.420
Holding firms
like Bullock & Barnes

04:06.507 --> 04:08.683
tend to only look
at the financial side

04:08.770 --> 04:10.815
of companies
under their control.

04:10.902 --> 04:12.252
I know that.

04:12.339 --> 04:14.471
I would be lying
if I said that I approved

04:14.558 --> 04:17.168
of what we just did
to the Flacco Company.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.738
Laying off 150 people
at Christmastime?

04:20.825 --> 04:23.001
It'’s not the kind of business
I enjoy being in.

04:23.088 --> 04:24.438
I know.

04:24.525 --> 04:26.570
You did what
they asked you to do.

04:26.657 --> 04:29.007
I just hope
you don'’t start liking it.

04:31.053 --> 04:33.229
Thank you, Dana.

04:33.316 --> 04:35.536
Well, you don'’t want to keep
Mr. Bullock waiting.

04:35.623 --> 04:38.495
No, I don'’t.
Merry Christmas.

04:38.582 --> 04:41.455
Merry Christmas, dear.
Good luck.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.239
Thank you.

04:46.242 --> 04:47.417
Hello?

04:47.504 --> 04:49.680
Hey, beautiful.
How'’d it go?

04:49.767 --> 04:51.726
Pretty well, I think.

04:51.813 --> 04:53.858
I completed the assignment
in record time

04:53.945 --> 04:55.991
and saved the company
a boatload of money,

04:56.078 --> 04:58.646
and we even made a small profit
by the time the smoke cleared.

04:58.733 --> 05:01.562
Fantastic.
How'’d the old man take the news?

05:01.649 --> 05:05.174
Good, I think.
He asked me to come see him.

05:05.261 --> 05:09.700
Ah. Oh, speaking of bosses,
mine'’s on the other line.

05:09.787 --> 05:11.485
You want to meet at DeLorie'’s
after work

05:11.572 --> 05:13.443
and fill me in
on all the nitty-gritty?

05:13.530 --> 05:15.532
Maybe we'’ll have something
to celebrate.

05:15.619 --> 05:17.142
Either way,
I'’m buying the drinks.

05:17.229 --> 05:18.143
Love you, sweetheart.

05:18.230 --> 05:19.362
You too.

05:26.761 --> 05:29.590
Ah, Riley.
Come in, sit down.

05:29.677 --> 05:32.419
Mr. Bullock,
you wanted to see me, sir?

05:32.506 --> 05:34.072
Yes, I did.

05:34.159 --> 05:37.641
I think after your performance
in the conference room,

05:37.728 --> 05:39.382
you might know why.

05:39.469 --> 05:42.124
Sir, if this is about the
Christmas bonus, I can explain.

05:42.211 --> 05:46.215
You did great. Handing out
those bonus checks was genius.

05:46.302 --> 05:48.043
You might be executive material.

05:48.130 --> 05:50.306
Executive material?

05:50.393 --> 05:53.135
Normally I wouldn'’t say this,
but you remind me of me.

05:53.222 --> 05:55.311
Wow.

05:55.398 --> 05:58.967
What do you know about
one of our smaller holdings,

05:59.054 --> 06:00.664
a company called OutWear?

06:00.751 --> 06:03.624
It'’s a boutique
outerwear company,

06:03.711 --> 06:07.062
designed one of the most popular
hiking jackets of the 1970s.

06:07.149 --> 06:08.933
I think my dad had one.

06:09.020 --> 06:12.633
I think we all did.
Fine jackets too.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.765
Did you know my late
business partner Brian Barnes

06:14.852 --> 06:16.724
was from that same town?

06:16.811 --> 06:19.988
No, sir, I didn'’t.
That sounds quaint.

06:20.075 --> 06:23.426
Yeah, of course it'’s quaint.
It'’s Vermont.

06:23.513 --> 06:27.822
Barnes was so moved
by the company'’s designs

06:27.909 --> 06:30.912
that he wanted it to be
the first place we invested in.

06:30.999 --> 06:32.392
That'’s really nice.

06:32.479 --> 06:37.745
Yes, the very definition
of small town success.

06:37.832 --> 06:39.877
But I never liked Barnes.

06:39.964 --> 06:42.663
I want you
to shut the company down.

06:42.750 --> 06:44.491
What?

06:44.578 --> 06:47.494
OutWear has been underselling
for the last five years easily,

06:47.581 --> 06:49.583
and it'’s time
to cut the dead weight.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.323
And you'’re handing this to me?

06:51.411 --> 06:53.325
Riley, what do you think
I'’ve been talking about here?

06:53.413 --> 06:54.675
Yes, I'’m handing it to you.

06:58.374 --> 06:59.593
You came to the right girl, sir.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.116
I will get right down
to the file room

07:01.203 --> 07:03.031
and start pulling
the fiscal reports.

07:03.118 --> 07:05.425
That won'’t cut it, Thomas.
I think you need to go there.

07:07.818 --> 07:10.821
I-I'’m sorry, go there?

07:10.908 --> 07:12.649
To Vermont.

07:12.736 --> 07:15.260
Mr. Bullock, I'’ve never been
north of 78th Street.

07:15.347 --> 07:18.786
Well, me neither, so don'’t
think of it as an assignment.

07:18.873 --> 07:21.310
Think of it as a vacation.

07:21.397 --> 07:24.139
Now, if you pull this off,

07:24.226 --> 07:27.011
you and me will be
just like this, understand?

07:28.578 --> 07:30.798
I understand.
A complete closeout.

07:30.885 --> 07:34.628
Employees, stock, equipment,
everything.

07:34.715 --> 07:35.759
Everything.

07:35.846 --> 07:37.892
Consider it done, sir.

07:37.979 --> 07:39.110
By Christmas, Riley.

07:39.197 --> 07:41.373
I'’ll get right on it, sir.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.027
Oh, and one more thing.

07:43.114 --> 07:44.725
Take a heavy coat with you.

07:44.812 --> 07:48.250
It'’s pretty chilly up in Vermont
this time of year.

07:48.337 --> 07:49.730
Great.

07:56.867 --> 07:58.956
Bring me another straw!

08:08.139 --> 08:09.750
- Hey, Wyatt.
- Oh, hey.

08:09.837 --> 08:12.100
Is that the new prototype
for the skiwear line?

08:12.187 --> 08:15.146
Yeah, just picked it up
from the factory.

08:15.233 --> 08:16.408
- What do you think?
- Wow.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.975
Good stitching.

08:18.062 --> 08:20.848
Nice insulation.

08:20.935 --> 08:23.372
Great work, Randy.

08:23.459 --> 08:24.895
Thanks, Wyatt.

08:24.982 --> 08:27.071
[Phone chiming]

08:29.160 --> 08:30.814
OutWear. This is Wyatt.

08:30.901 --> 08:33.904
Hi, Wyatt, this is Cyril
from Preston Bullock'’s office

08:33.991 --> 08:35.732
at Bullock & Barnes.

08:35.818 --> 08:38.779
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

08:38.866 --> 08:40.476
Mr. Bullock asked me
to give you a call

08:40.563 --> 08:42.433
and just sort of
let you know

08:42.522 --> 08:44.436
that we'’re gonna
send somebody down there

08:44.524 --> 08:46.395
to take a look
at the company.

08:46.482 --> 08:47.614
Look, Cecil--

08:47.701 --> 08:49.920
It'’s Cyril, actually.

08:50.007 --> 08:51.443
My parents were hoping
for a girl,

08:51.531 --> 08:54.185
and they really wanted
to name her Carol, so...

08:54.272 --> 08:56.274
Right, um...

08:56.361 --> 08:58.668
I know the numbers
haven'’t been great.

08:58.755 --> 09:01.192
Tell Mr. Bullock that we'’re
launching several new products,

09:01.279 --> 09:03.020
and I'’m confident
that things will turn around

09:03.107 --> 09:04.369
by the end of the quarter.

09:04.456 --> 09:05.893
Yes, absolutely,
and I actually--

09:05.980 --> 09:08.591
I did tell him that already.

09:08.678 --> 09:11.115
And what'’d he say?

09:11.202 --> 09:14.031
He said to send a consultant
as soon as possible.

09:14.118 --> 09:15.903
Okay. And when is he arriving?

09:15.990 --> 09:18.340
She arrives
first thing tomorrow morning.

09:20.124 --> 09:22.736
We'’ll... We'’ll be ready.

09:22.823 --> 09:24.781
That'’s gonna make
Mr. Bullock very happy.

09:24.868 --> 09:25.739
Talk to you soon.

09:27.088 --> 09:29.264
MR. BULLOCK: Cyril!

09:29.351 --> 09:31.005
Yes, sir?

09:31.092 --> 09:33.442
My computer'’s not working!

09:33.529 --> 09:35.575
Is it turned on, sir?

09:37.141 --> 09:38.621
Thank you, Cyril!

09:38.708 --> 09:40.623
Anytime, sir.

09:40.710 --> 09:42.059
Anytime.

09:48.500 --> 09:49.501
Hello.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.503
Mom.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.549
Mrs. Faust needed a ride
to do some errands,

09:53.636 --> 09:55.333
so I just thought
I'’d stop by.

09:55.420 --> 09:57.727
Well, thanks, but it'’s not
a very good time.

09:57.814 --> 10:00.556
Oh, when is it ever really
a good time?

10:00.643 --> 10:03.080
You know, you work too hard.
Did you have breakfast?

10:03.167 --> 10:04.778
You look pale.

10:04.865 --> 10:06.127
I had a coffee--
have a coffee.

10:06.214 --> 10:07.171
I'’ll get you something.

10:07.258 --> 10:09.739
No, that'’s not necessary.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.438
How about dinner?
I'’ll make chicken-fried steak.

10:13.525 --> 10:14.570
- Mom--
- Chicken-fried chicken?

10:14.657 --> 10:16.485
I just need to do my job.

10:16.572 --> 10:19.270
Everybody around here'’s trying
to tell me how to do my job.

10:19.357 --> 10:20.837
No offense.

10:20.924 --> 10:23.231
Okay, what'’s wrong?

10:23.318 --> 10:25.233
This company'’s been around
for 50 years.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.191
We have a reputation
for quality and integrity,

10:27.278 --> 10:31.239
and whatever downturn
we might be in,

10:31.326 --> 10:33.067
I can handle it.

10:33.154 --> 10:35.460
All right, well,
you promise me one thing.

10:35.547 --> 10:36.766
What'’s that?

10:36.853 --> 10:38.420
You promise me
that you will also

10:38.507 --> 10:39.943
take care of you.

10:40.030 --> 10:41.641
Yes. Thank you.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.251
All right.

10:44.905 --> 10:46.123
Mwah!

10:47.429 --> 10:49.300
Oh. Dinner tonight, 7:00?

10:49.387 --> 10:50.301
Rain check.

10:50.388 --> 10:51.520
You work too hard.

10:51.607 --> 10:54.305
- Okay.
- [Laughing]

10:54.392 --> 10:56.394
Ha ha ha ha ha.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.093
[Sighs]
Oh, boy.

11:00.572 --> 11:03.053
- DAVID: Vermont, huh?
- RILEY: Yep.

11:03.140 --> 11:07.101
Well, so isn'’t that where
the cheese comes from?

11:07.188 --> 11:08.798
No, I think that'’s Wisconsin.

11:08.885 --> 11:10.365
New England produces
maple syrup.

11:10.452 --> 11:11.888
I don'’t know.
But Vermont too.

11:11.975 --> 11:15.413
They invented cheddar
or something.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.893
- Does it matter?
- No.

11:16.980 --> 11:18.329
I'’m not going there
for the cheese.

11:18.416 --> 11:20.636
I'’m gonna liquidate
a failing company.

11:20.723 --> 11:24.248
And if I do a good job,
there'’ll be some nice dividends.

11:24.335 --> 11:26.903
See, that sounds like fun.
I wish I could be there for it.

11:26.990 --> 11:28.296
Why do they have
to fire everybody

11:28.383 --> 11:29.906
right before Christmas?

11:29.993 --> 11:32.213
Why can'’t they just wait
until after the holiday?

11:32.300 --> 11:35.042
Hey, Christmas is just
a commercialized holiday

11:35.129 --> 11:36.826
designed to separate you
from your wallet.

11:36.913 --> 11:38.523
You know that.

11:38.610 --> 11:42.049
Besides, you didn'’t
cause this business to fail.

11:42.136 --> 11:43.659
Companies open and close
all the time.

11:43.746 --> 11:45.966
It'’s just the ying and yang
of commerce.

11:46.053 --> 11:47.402
Yeah. No, you'’re right.

11:47.489 --> 11:50.448
I didn'’t cause
the company to fail.

11:50.535 --> 11:53.408
I just wish I didn'’t
have to go there.

11:53.495 --> 11:56.541
Well, if it were me,

11:56.628 --> 11:59.196
I would not tell them
the bad news

11:59.283 --> 12:00.937
until the very last moment,

12:01.024 --> 12:02.765
use a cover story
to get what I want

12:02.852 --> 12:06.334
and then give them the ax
when I'’m on my way out the door.

12:06.421 --> 12:08.640
Yeah. No, you'’re right.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.381
Of course I am.

12:10.468 --> 12:12.862
Besides, how bad could it be?

12:12.949 --> 12:15.691
Yeah, how bad could it be?

12:15.778 --> 12:18.781
♪ Oh, the countdown'’s on ♪

12:18.868 --> 12:21.741
♪ Just a few more days

12:43.327 --> 12:45.634
I think you'’ll find me
more than qualified--

12:47.723 --> 12:49.029
Well, boys.

12:49.116 --> 12:50.682
Hey, Nick, how'’s it look?

12:50.770 --> 12:52.336
- It'’s looking good.
- Thanks.

12:53.598 --> 12:56.166
How can one be
more than sat--

12:56.253 --> 12:58.690
Talking to yourself, Nick?

12:58.778 --> 13:00.736
Oh, it'’s just practicing.

13:00.823 --> 13:02.651
- Gotcha.
- Let me ask you something.

13:02.738 --> 13:04.827
Do you think
it'’s possible for someone

13:04.914 --> 13:07.264
to be more than qualified
for something?

13:07.351 --> 13:09.136
Not if you'’re working here.

13:09.223 --> 13:11.660
Ho, ho, ho.

13:11.747 --> 13:14.315
I think you'’ll find me
more than qualified--

13:14.402 --> 13:16.447
Merry Christmas, Mr. Harper!

13:16.534 --> 13:19.581
Merry Christmas to you.
Slow down!

13:19.668 --> 13:20.582
Sorry!

13:20.669 --> 13:21.801
Ohh!

13:21.888 --> 13:23.411
Ooh.

13:25.065 --> 13:26.980
Here, take my hand.

13:28.329 --> 13:30.287
Stop those kids!
They attacked me!

13:30.374 --> 13:31.854
Aw, I think they were
just not paying attention

13:31.941 --> 13:33.682
- to what they were doing.
- Are you kidding me?

13:33.769 --> 13:35.118
They took my bag.

13:40.689 --> 13:41.951
This one?

13:42.038 --> 13:45.259
Well, um, yes.
Thank you.

13:45.346 --> 13:48.610
- New in town?
- What gave it away?

13:48.697 --> 13:53.354
Well, most locals don'’t need
a map to find their way around.

13:53.441 --> 13:54.746
Right.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.750
I don'’t suppose you know
where OutWear is located?

13:58.838 --> 14:01.405
Well, I just might.
I was on my way there myself.

14:01.492 --> 14:04.669
- You were?
- Yeah. Gonna apply for a job.

14:04.756 --> 14:07.585
Why would you apply for a job
two weeks before Christmas?

14:07.672 --> 14:10.588
It'’s the time when people
need extra help the most.

14:10.675 --> 14:12.286
That'’s a good point.

14:12.373 --> 14:14.201
I'’m Riley.

14:14.288 --> 14:15.506
Nick.

14:15.593 --> 14:17.117
Well, mind if I
tag along, Nick?

14:17.204 --> 14:19.206
Not as long as you
watch your step.

14:19.293 --> 14:21.208
That'’s very funny.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.864
- We'’re going this way.
- Yeah, I got it.

14:54.719 --> 14:57.113
- Hey, Nick.
- Steve.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.462
Hey, good to see you.

14:58.549 --> 15:00.856
Hello!
Can I help you, miss?

15:00.943 --> 15:03.076
Yes, hi.
I'’m Riley Thomas.

15:03.163 --> 15:05.121
I'’m just in from New York,
from Bullock & Barnes.

15:05.208 --> 15:06.644
I believe I'’m expected.

15:06.731 --> 15:08.472
Oh, Bullock & Barnes.

15:08.559 --> 15:10.518
You'’ll be wanting
to talk to Wyatt.

15:10.605 --> 15:12.302
Let me go get him.

15:12.389 --> 15:14.000
Can I get you some coffee?

15:14.087 --> 15:15.175
No.

15:17.046 --> 15:18.308
This is their corporate office?

15:18.395 --> 15:20.136
Yeah.

15:21.703 --> 15:25.141
"OutWear.
For a better life out there."

15:25.228 --> 15:26.969
That'’s not bad.

15:27.056 --> 15:29.189
I'’ve grown kind of
fond of it myself.

15:29.276 --> 15:30.320
You like it?

15:30.407 --> 15:32.844
He ought to.
He wrote it.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.411
Wyatt.

15:35.847 --> 15:37.849
Oh, here, I'’ll take her.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.547
[Dog whines]

15:39.634 --> 15:41.679
Mr. Harper.

15:41.766 --> 15:43.377
I don'’t understand.

15:43.464 --> 15:46.423
This is Nick Harper,
founder of OutWear.

15:46.510 --> 15:49.383
Founder? You said you were
coming to apply for a job.

15:49.470 --> 15:51.820
I am. I haven'’t worked here
for years.

15:51.907 --> 15:55.128
After I sold the company
to your boss, they retired me.

15:55.215 --> 15:56.825
Nick, you know things
are too slow around here

15:56.912 --> 15:58.087
to bring on anybody new.

15:58.174 --> 16:00.437
I hardly think of myself
as someone new.

16:00.524 --> 16:02.135
You know what I mean.
As for your boss,

16:02.222 --> 16:03.701
I appreciate the fact
that he thinks we need help,

16:03.788 --> 16:05.268
but we'’re doing just fine.

16:05.355 --> 16:08.097
I think this whole trip
was just a waste of time.

16:08.184 --> 16:11.231
Help? What exactly did Bullock
tell you about my coming here?

16:11.318 --> 16:14.538
Well, we only chatted briefly,
but he said you'’d be coming down

16:14.625 --> 16:16.105
to make some adjustments
for profit,

16:16.192 --> 16:17.889
so I assume that meant
helping us

16:17.977 --> 16:20.153
end our holiday quarter
on a high note.

16:22.590 --> 16:25.897
Yes, that is it.
Exactly.

16:25.985 --> 16:29.858
Well, like I said,
we don'’t need the help, so...

16:29.945 --> 16:31.555
I'’m glad you feel that way,

16:31.642 --> 16:34.645
but the holding company
has a controlling interest,

16:34.732 --> 16:37.039
so unfortunately you don'’t get
to make those decisions.

16:37.126 --> 16:40.477
Well, technically,
I have operating authority.

16:40.564 --> 16:41.565
For now.

16:43.915 --> 16:45.482
For now.

16:45.569 --> 16:48.268
Okay, why don'’t we
discuss this in my office?

16:48.355 --> 16:50.574
Upstairs.

16:50.661 --> 16:51.662
Fine.

16:51.749 --> 16:52.663
Fine!

16:52.750 --> 16:54.013
Right this way.

16:57.625 --> 16:59.366
Hey, where you going?

16:59.453 --> 17:01.933
If there are any major decisions
to be made about the company,

17:02.021 --> 17:03.457
I'’d like to sit in.

17:03.544 --> 17:06.242
Nick, I can handle this.

17:06.329 --> 17:09.376
Okay, I'’d like to stick around
if that'’s okay with you.

17:09.463 --> 17:11.856
Fine, but you can'’t come
into the meeting.

17:11.943 --> 17:16.773
Okay, as you like.
So what do you want me to do?

17:16.861 --> 17:19.560
I don'’t know.

17:19.646 --> 17:21.910
Talk to Edy.

17:21.997 --> 17:23.694
Okay.

17:23.781 --> 17:25.914
This way.

17:27.872 --> 17:29.657
You like my tinsel?

17:37.360 --> 17:40.059
Look, I apologize if I was
a little short out there,

17:40.146 --> 17:43.062
but I'’m pretty protective
of this company,

17:43.149 --> 17:44.802
and this season
hasn'’t been the kindest.

17:44.889 --> 17:46.543
Fair enough.

17:46.630 --> 17:49.155
OutWear hasn'’t produced
a breakout product in sometime,

17:49.242 --> 17:51.461
and for a company that employees
almost the entire town,

17:51.548 --> 17:54.203
I'’m well aware
that we need a little boost.

17:54.290 --> 17:56.988
Did you say this place
employs the entire town?

17:57.076 --> 17:58.903
Yeah, a good number.

17:58.990 --> 18:01.036
It is a small town after all.

18:01.123 --> 18:03.778
Of course.

18:03.865 --> 18:07.434
And what makes you think
I'’m not the boost you need?

18:07.521 --> 18:11.002
Well, no offense, but I'’ve dealt
with you corporate types before,

18:11.090 --> 18:14.441
and you people look at places
like bugs under a microscope.

18:14.528 --> 18:16.921
So what you'’re saying is
I lack the ability

18:17.008 --> 18:18.880
to see this company
for what it really is.

18:18.967 --> 18:21.187
In so many words, yeah.

18:21.274 --> 18:26.017
Well, as I said before,
you don'’t really have a choice.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.846
However...

18:28.933 --> 18:31.849
- I do agree.
- You do?

18:31.936 --> 18:35.375
Well, you'’re right.
I mean, I don'’t know this place,

18:35.462 --> 18:37.203
and if I'’m going to get
a proper assessment

18:37.290 --> 18:38.943
of what'’s
in front of me,

18:39.030 --> 18:41.946
I'’m gonna need the assistance
of someone who does.

18:42.033 --> 18:45.776
But since you don'’t seem
to want to help me,

18:45.863 --> 18:47.735
I will find
someone who can.

18:47.822 --> 18:50.129
Okay, um...

18:50.216 --> 18:52.392
What? Hold on.

18:52.479 --> 18:54.176
Wait a minute.

18:57.484 --> 19:00.095
You, Nick,
you wanted a job?

19:00.182 --> 19:01.923
- Yeah.
- You'’re hired.

19:02.010 --> 19:03.881
What? You can'’t just
hire anybody.

19:03.968 --> 19:05.579
Actually, I can.

19:05.666 --> 19:08.147
As the appointed representative
of Bullock & Barnes,

19:08.234 --> 19:09.670
you work for me.

19:09.757 --> 19:11.193
What?

19:11.280 --> 19:12.803
That'’s right.

19:12.890 --> 19:17.417
I'’m the boss now,
and I choose to hire him.

19:17.504 --> 19:19.984
- That'’s insane!
- No, actually it'’s perfect.

19:20.071 --> 19:21.595
Who better to teach me
the inner workings of OutWear

19:21.682 --> 19:23.249
than the founder
of the company?

19:23.336 --> 19:26.339
Oh, sure, and we'’re gonna
pay him with what money?

19:26.426 --> 19:28.341
Or did you forget the entire
reason that you'’re here

19:28.428 --> 19:32.127
is because we'’re
in a financial bind?

19:32.214 --> 19:34.390
Apprentice?

19:34.477 --> 19:35.783
A what?

19:35.870 --> 19:38.699
Interesting.
An apprentice.

19:38.786 --> 19:39.917
An apprentice.

19:40.004 --> 19:42.311
- Are you in?
- No!

19:42.398 --> 19:44.357
- I am in.
- Nick, crazy though it may be,

19:44.444 --> 19:47.098
welcome to the new OutWear
apprenticeship program.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.666
- Thank you. When do I start?
- Two minutes ago.

19:49.753 --> 19:52.016
I need you to gather all
the information you can dig up,

19:52.103 --> 19:55.194
and I want to know
where every body is buried.

19:57.979 --> 20:00.286
What just happened?

20:00.373 --> 20:03.854
Looks like there'’s
a new sheriff in town.

20:03.941 --> 20:06.422
But I thought
the whole point of this trip

20:06.509 --> 20:08.990
was to close the place down,
not hire new people.

20:09.077 --> 20:12.559
Yeah, I know,
but what can it hurt?

20:12.646 --> 20:14.822
Besides, Mr. Bullock
wants me to look

20:14.909 --> 20:16.563
at the saleable assets
of OutWear,

20:16.650 --> 20:19.087
and I found just the perfect
person to help me do that.

20:19.174 --> 20:21.176
Even if he doesn'’t realize
what he'’s doing?

20:21.263 --> 20:23.657
I didn'’t lie to him.
I didn'’t lie to anybody.

20:23.744 --> 20:26.225
I just left a few things out.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.575
I hear you. I would'’ve done
the exact same thing.

20:28.662 --> 20:30.838
Really?

20:30.925 --> 20:32.753
So how'’s the town?

20:32.840 --> 20:35.625
Small, cold.

20:35.712 --> 20:37.410
The people seem nice enough.

20:37.497 --> 20:41.283
There'’s this one guy,
oh, he'’s a handful.

20:41.370 --> 20:43.633
But his days are numbered,
right?

20:43.720 --> 20:45.592
Right.

20:45.679 --> 20:47.985
That'’s my girl.

20:48.072 --> 20:50.205
- Talk soon.
- Bye, gorgeous.

21:02.913 --> 21:04.915
I know you won'’t be thrilled

21:05.002 --> 21:06.830
with me going back
to work again,

21:06.917 --> 21:09.398
but it did feel awful nice,

21:09.485 --> 21:14.403
hanging out around
the old offices again.

21:14.490 --> 21:18.538
I guess a part of me
never really left there.

21:21.192 --> 21:23.151
Don'’t figure to put up
a tree this Christmas.

21:23.238 --> 21:25.936
There'’s nobody
to help me decorate it.

21:29.592 --> 21:34.205
Never was very good at much
of anything without you.

21:36.512 --> 21:37.818
Still the same.

21:40.647 --> 21:42.257
I love you.

21:52.006 --> 21:54.182
Morning, Edy, Katie.

21:54.269 --> 21:56.140
- Morning.
- Morning.

21:56.227 --> 21:58.404
Morning.

21:58.491 --> 22:00.144
Steve.

22:00.231 --> 22:02.886
Steve, right.

22:02.973 --> 22:04.410
- It'’s a pleasure.
- Likewise.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.153
What is this?

22:09.240 --> 22:11.547
That'’s an invitation
to OutWear'’s party.

22:11.634 --> 22:15.290
Oh! Can you afford to be
throwing a party right now

22:15.377 --> 22:18.859
with the company
doing so poorly?

22:18.946 --> 22:20.121
What are you celebrating?

22:20.208 --> 22:22.123
We'’re celebrating Christmas.

22:22.210 --> 22:24.212
Thank you, Edy,

22:24.299 --> 22:26.693
but I don'’t think I'’ll still
be around on Christmas Eve.

22:26.780 --> 22:29.609
WYATT: Don'’t take off your coat!
You'’re not staying.

22:35.354 --> 22:38.531
As I told you yesterday,
I'’m not going anywhere.

22:38.618 --> 22:40.663
You and I have an appointment
to go to the prototype floor.

22:40.750 --> 22:43.013
Do you want to see the various
parts of OutWear? Well...

22:43.100 --> 22:45.015
you get what you ask for.

22:45.102 --> 22:49.629
I see. I'’d like to wait for Nick
to join us, if that'’s all right.

22:49.716 --> 22:51.979
I'’m way ahead of you.
He'’s already on his way there.

22:55.156 --> 22:58.289
The factory'’s
about six blocks that way,

22:58.377 --> 23:00.248
right past the theater.

23:00.335 --> 23:02.859
Can you tell me again
why we'’re not driving?

23:02.946 --> 23:06.385
Are you kidding me?
This fresh air is amazing.

23:06.472 --> 23:08.343
Excuse me.

23:10.127 --> 23:16.612
- Can I help you?
- Oh, yes, thank you.

23:16.699 --> 23:19.789
- Thank you so much, Wyatt.
- You'’re welcome.

23:21.704 --> 23:24.185
You'’re not cold or anything,
are you?

23:24.272 --> 23:26.317
Of course I'’m cold.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.189
But if you'’re trying to get me
sick, it'’s not gonna work.

23:28.276 --> 23:32.280
I have the constitution
of a horse.

23:32.367 --> 23:34.935
Well, that explains everything.

23:35.022 --> 23:37.285
But seriously,
I walk as much as possible.

23:37.372 --> 23:39.722
I love being out on the streets
of this town. It'’s beautiful.

23:39.809 --> 23:41.115
- Wyatt!
- Hey, Wendy!

23:41.202 --> 23:42.725
Just the person
I was looking for.

23:42.812 --> 23:44.727
I need someone
to try my new flavor.

23:44.814 --> 23:45.989
Yeah, sure.

23:50.820 --> 23:52.866
Mmm, Wendy...

23:52.953 --> 23:54.389
that'’s a winner.

24:00.917 --> 24:03.180
Mmm! Okay.

24:03.267 --> 24:05.139
That'’s amazing.

24:05.226 --> 24:07.271
What is in this?

24:07.358 --> 24:09.622
Wouldn'’t you like to know?

24:09.709 --> 24:12.059
Everybody gets really excited
around Christmas.

24:12.146 --> 24:13.800
I think it'’s just
too much sugar.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.194
Christmas is
a commercialized holiday

24:17.281 --> 24:19.762
designed to separate you
from your wallet.

24:19.849 --> 24:22.243
Whoa! What grouch said that?

24:22.330 --> 24:24.463
Someone who knows
what they'’re talking about.

24:24.550 --> 24:28.858
Oh, well, how about we continue
on with our pleasant day?

24:28.945 --> 24:31.295
Yes, it'’s so pleasant.

24:36.692 --> 24:38.520
- Wyatt!
- Jim!

24:38.607 --> 24:40.435
- How you doing, pal?
- I'’m good, Jim.

24:40.522 --> 24:43.177
I'’m doing, doing great.

24:43.264 --> 24:44.613
How'’s things on the floor?

24:44.700 --> 24:46.441
Have you got any new designs?

24:46.528 --> 24:48.530
We could really use
some new designs.

24:48.617 --> 24:51.272
There'’s not much point
in having a prototype plant

24:51.359 --> 24:53.622
if we don'’t have
any prototypes.

24:53.709 --> 24:57.931
I do. I'’m working on some
pretty important things.

24:58.018 --> 25:00.629
We'’ll have some
new designs soon.

25:00.716 --> 25:02.326
You will?

25:02.413 --> 25:04.938
Yeah, sure, kind of.

25:05.025 --> 25:08.071
Jim, this is Riley.
She'’s from New York.

25:08.158 --> 25:10.509
I heard about you.

25:10.596 --> 25:11.945
Howdy, ma'’am.

25:12.032 --> 25:14.208
Howdy, Jim.

25:14.295 --> 25:16.384
Nick here yet?

25:16.471 --> 25:19.082
Oh, yeah, he'’s out on the floor.
He'’s waiting for you.

25:19.169 --> 25:20.562
Of course he is.

25:20.649 --> 25:22.433
Right this way.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.177
Would you mind
getting rid of that for me?

25:27.264 --> 25:29.136
Oh, sure, no problem.

25:30.659 --> 25:32.400
Merry Christmas.

25:32.487 --> 25:34.533
Merry Christmas.

25:42.628 --> 25:43.846
That'’s a winner.

25:53.247 --> 25:55.466
- Hey, Wyatt.
- Frank.

25:55.554 --> 25:56.816
How you doing? Nick!

25:56.903 --> 25:59.427
- How you doing?
- Frank.

25:59.514 --> 26:01.516
You must be the New York gal
who'’s come to give us

26:01.603 --> 26:03.736
one of those big,
fancy city makeovers.

26:03.823 --> 26:06.565
I watch your shows on TV
with my wife.

26:06.652 --> 26:09.176
Riley Thomas.
Pleased to meet you.

26:09.263 --> 26:11.613
This is Frank. He oversees
factory management for OutWear.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.267
- Been with us a long time.
- Mm-hmm.

26:13.354 --> 26:15.574
- Since, uh--
- Well, since him.

26:15.661 --> 26:17.750
Well, we were younger then.

26:17.837 --> 26:19.752
That'’s for sure.
Management comes and goes,

26:19.839 --> 26:21.928
but things here on the floor
stay the same.

26:22.015 --> 26:23.582
Still, it'’s good
to have you back, Nick,

26:23.669 --> 26:24.757
even if it is as an intern.

26:24.844 --> 26:26.976
- Apprentice.
- Apprentice?

26:27.063 --> 26:29.457
Well, pay attention, son.

26:29.544 --> 26:32.460
You just might learn something.
[Laughs]

26:32.547 --> 26:34.549
I'’m sure you guys don'’t want
to sit here talking all day.

26:34.636 --> 26:36.725
Let'’s show Riley here
the lay of the land. Follow me.

26:36.812 --> 26:38.335
After you.

26:41.730 --> 26:42.775
Check this out.

26:44.515 --> 26:46.387
Thank you so much
for what you'’re doing.

26:46.474 --> 26:48.911
Yes, thank you!

26:48.998 --> 26:52.132
- What was that all about?
- Beats me.

26:54.525 --> 26:56.963
Oh, very nice!

26:57.050 --> 26:59.400
Is there documentation
for all of this equipment?

26:59.487 --> 27:01.576
Serial numbers,
make, model, ID'’s?

27:01.663 --> 27:03.099
Yeah, absolutely.

27:03.186 --> 27:07.147
Great. These are in
excellent condition.

27:07.234 --> 27:09.802
Thank you so much
for showing me around.

27:09.889 --> 27:11.630
- Appreciate it.
- No, ma'’am, thank you.

27:11.717 --> 27:13.806
Everyone here is very grateful
for what you'’re doing.

27:13.893 --> 27:16.939
Don'’t mention it, Frank.

27:17.026 --> 27:18.462
- Bye.
- See ya, Frank.

27:18.549 --> 27:20.464
- Nick.
- Take care, Frank.

27:20.551 --> 27:22.292
You kids want a ride
back to the office?

27:22.379 --> 27:24.512
- No.
- Yes.

27:24.599 --> 27:26.688
NICK: Y-You walked here?

27:26.775 --> 27:28.734
I don'’t want to talk about it.

27:40.920 --> 27:44.271
RILEY: While we were in there,
everyone kept thanking me. Why?

27:44.358 --> 27:46.708
Well, news travels fast
in a small town.

27:46.795 --> 27:48.144
What do you mean?

27:48.231 --> 27:50.146
Look, it'’s no secret

27:50.233 --> 27:53.628
that OutWear has been
in a tough place recently.

27:53.715 --> 27:55.630
A lot of people have been
resigned to the fact

27:55.717 --> 27:57.284
that this could be it.

27:57.371 --> 28:00.635
That Christmas Eve party
you'’ve been hearing about?

28:00.722 --> 28:03.377
People were pretty prepared
for that to be the last hurrah.

28:03.464 --> 28:05.161
What changed?

28:05.248 --> 28:07.076
You, my dear.

28:07.163 --> 28:08.556
Me?

28:08.643 --> 28:11.428
Yeah, you.
Like I said, news travels fast.

28:11.515 --> 28:14.780
When people heard somebody was
coming from New York to help,

28:14.867 --> 28:17.217
well, they got pretty excited.

28:17.304 --> 28:19.262
I see.

28:19.349 --> 28:21.612
I think that we could'’ve
pulled it off without you,

28:21.700 --> 28:25.573
but, hey, if people
get pumped up, so be it.

28:25.660 --> 28:27.749
[Intercom buzzes]

28:27.836 --> 28:30.230
SECRETARY: Mr. Bullock,
Miss Thomas on line one.

28:30.317 --> 28:32.058
Put her through.

28:32.145 --> 28:34.190
- RILEY: Mr. Bullock.
- Thomas!

28:34.277 --> 28:36.802
- Did you get my email?
- Of course I got your email.

28:36.889 --> 28:39.456
Are those numbers accurate?

28:39.543 --> 28:41.371
Yes, sir.
I just visited the factory

28:41.458 --> 28:44.026
and got an itemized list
of all the equipment on site.

28:44.113 --> 28:46.072
There is a lot of value
on the property

28:46.159 --> 28:49.597
and a small profit to be made
by liquidating the items there.

28:49.684 --> 28:51.599
Kaboom!
Just what I wanted to hear.

28:51.686 --> 28:53.557
Thank you, sir.

28:53.644 --> 28:55.516
You take care of business,
and we'’ll have you out of there

28:55.603 --> 28:56.560
by Christmas.

28:56.647 --> 28:58.998
Of course, sir, thank you.

28:59.085 --> 29:00.086
Mr. Bullock?

29:00.173 --> 29:01.609
Yes, Thomas?

29:01.696 --> 29:04.046
What happens to the people?

29:04.133 --> 29:06.440
- What people?
- The people who work here.

29:06.527 --> 29:09.182
What happens to them
when we close OutWear down?

29:09.269 --> 29:11.314
Thomas, I'’m not
the Ghost of Christmas Future.

29:11.401 --> 29:13.839
I don'’t know where Tiny Tim
will be a year from now.

29:13.926 --> 29:15.623
It'’s not our problem.

29:15.710 --> 29:17.538
I know, sir.

29:17.625 --> 29:20.062
Look, it'’s time to focus
on Christmas present,

29:20.149 --> 29:22.282
not on Christmas past,
got it?

29:22.369 --> 29:24.197
Yes, sir, I do.

29:24.284 --> 29:25.807
Good. Then we agree.

29:25.894 --> 29:28.854
- Yes, sir, we do.
- Excellent.

29:28.941 --> 29:30.464
Now get back to work.

29:30.551 --> 29:32.988
- Thank you, sir.
- Remember, Thomas,

29:33.075 --> 29:35.556
I gave you this job
because you'’re the one person

29:35.643 --> 29:38.124
who wouldn'’t dare
disappoint me.

29:46.175 --> 29:47.829
MR. BULLOCK:
Oh, and get me a milkshake!

29:47.916 --> 29:49.831
Yes, sir.
Whatever you want, sir.

29:51.528 --> 29:53.095
Fore!

29:53.182 --> 29:54.140
Uhh!

29:56.011 --> 29:58.535
[Groans]
Be the ball.

30:06.369 --> 30:07.631
[Crash]

30:18.686 --> 30:20.557
Can I help you?

30:20.644 --> 30:22.342
I wanted some coffee,

30:22.429 --> 30:24.648
and the cup
just flew out of my hand.

30:24.735 --> 30:26.259
There'’s so much paperwork
to be done.

30:26.346 --> 30:29.131
I guess I just
got ahead of myself.

30:29.218 --> 30:31.046
Accidents happen.
You'’re probably just tired.

30:31.133 --> 30:32.656
It'’s already been
a long morning.

30:32.743 --> 30:34.920
I just want to help.

30:35.007 --> 30:37.574
Do you really or do you
just not want to be home?

30:37.661 --> 30:38.837
You are smart.

30:43.276 --> 30:44.668
You know what?

30:46.888 --> 30:48.237
Why don'’t we get out of here?

30:48.324 --> 30:50.152
Let somebody else make
the coffee for a change.

30:50.239 --> 30:51.501
You'’re the boss.

30:51.588 --> 30:52.807
I am.

31:08.823 --> 31:10.216
Here we go.

31:12.261 --> 31:13.393
Look at them go.

31:13.480 --> 31:16.352
Don'’t got a care in the world.

31:16.439 --> 31:17.963
Nothing else matters.

31:18.050 --> 31:19.181
You ever try skiing?

31:19.268 --> 31:20.922
Me? No.

31:21.009 --> 31:24.056
It'’s a huge waste of time,
like golf.

31:24.143 --> 31:26.797
Plus it'’s dangerous.
I like to be in complete control

31:26.885 --> 31:28.234
of everything
that is happening to me.

31:28.321 --> 31:30.889
Well, sure you do.
Everybody does.

31:30.976 --> 31:34.327
But fate does have a way
of sticking out its foot

31:34.414 --> 31:36.329
and tripping you
from time to time.

31:36.416 --> 31:38.200
Well, that sounds like you'’re
speaking from experience.

31:38.287 --> 31:39.462
I know a little bit about it.

31:39.549 --> 31:40.724
Tripping?

31:40.811 --> 31:42.248
Fate.

31:42.335 --> 31:46.600
My wife Miriam.

31:46.687 --> 31:49.646
Christmas was
a very important time for her.

31:49.733 --> 31:52.998
It was the one time of year when
we'’d set everything else aside

31:53.085 --> 31:56.653
and just celebrate what
really mattered in our life.

31:56.740 --> 31:58.481
So what changed?

32:00.440 --> 32:02.746
She passed away
two years ago.

32:02.833 --> 32:06.228
Oh. I'’m sorry.
I wasn'’t thinking.

32:06.315 --> 32:10.319
To see Miriam at Christmas was
like looking at a little kid.

32:10.406 --> 32:17.370
She was so full of anticipation
and excitement.

32:17.457 --> 32:20.112
Everything old was new again.

32:20.199 --> 32:22.505
She must have
really been something.

32:22.592 --> 32:24.986
She was.

32:25.073 --> 32:27.032
Still, I don'’t know
how she'’d feel

32:27.119 --> 32:29.382
about you working
over Christmas.

32:29.469 --> 32:32.385
Miriam believed that
if people needed help,

32:32.472 --> 32:35.910
and you could lend a hand,
you should do it,

32:35.997 --> 32:37.216
especially at Christmas.

32:39.696 --> 32:41.698
Food for thought, Nick.

32:41.785 --> 32:43.178
Kinda.

32:52.231 --> 32:53.884
Looks like
we'’re the last ones here.

32:53.972 --> 32:55.974
Yeah, I guess so,

32:56.061 --> 32:58.237
thanks to your idea
we play hooky.

32:58.324 --> 32:59.978
Well, I really shouldn'’t
have done that.

33:00.065 --> 33:03.068
So much to do, so little time,
but I'’m glad we did.

33:03.155 --> 33:04.069
Me too.

33:04.156 --> 33:05.070
Oh, that'’s mine.

33:05.157 --> 33:06.897
What is this?

33:11.032 --> 33:13.165
These are incredible.
Did you draw these?

33:13.252 --> 33:14.514
Well, I scribbled them.

33:14.601 --> 33:17.430
Some of these designs
are outstanding.

33:17.517 --> 33:18.822
I thought you said you quit?

33:18.909 --> 33:21.695
Well, they'’re pretty old,
like me.

33:21.782 --> 33:24.611
Well, some things
stand the test of time.

33:24.698 --> 33:26.613
Have you shown these to Wyatt?

33:26.700 --> 33:28.136
No, I wouldn'’t waste his time.

33:28.223 --> 33:29.572
Nick.

33:29.659 --> 33:32.227
Besides, I'’m happily retired.

33:32.314 --> 33:34.316
If you were happily retired,

33:34.403 --> 33:36.144
you wouldn'’t be standing here
right now.

33:36.231 --> 33:37.972
You know what I mean.

33:38.059 --> 33:41.410
I still think you should show
them to Wyatt at some point.

33:41.497 --> 33:42.672
Show me what?

33:42.759 --> 33:43.847
Oh, nothing, Wyatt.

33:43.934 --> 33:45.371
Just some old reports.

33:45.458 --> 33:46.372
I thought you'’d gone.

33:46.459 --> 33:48.548
I wish. I'’m done now.

33:48.635 --> 33:49.810
Good.

33:49.897 --> 33:52.421
We were just
about to close up.

33:52.508 --> 33:54.684
Oh, really?

33:54.771 --> 33:56.556
You were about to close up?

33:56.643 --> 33:58.601
Then maybe I should ask,
"May I be excused?"

33:58.688 --> 34:01.952
Or "Do you need
anything else from me?"

34:02.040 --> 34:02.953
No.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.086
You'’re free to go.

34:09.786 --> 34:11.005
Whew!

34:12.963 --> 34:15.879
Nick? You coming?

34:15.966 --> 34:17.793
Sure, Wyatt, sure.

34:29.502 --> 34:32.025
Say, Riley, you need a ride?

34:32.112 --> 34:36.074
I can'’t believe I'’m saying this,
but I think I'’ll walk.

34:36.161 --> 34:38.946
Well, let'’s face it, Nick.

34:39.033 --> 34:41.166
Ms. Thomas has had enough of us
for the day.

34:41.253 --> 34:43.385
That'’s not fair.
Just because you don'’t like me

34:43.472 --> 34:45.344
doesn'’t mean you need
to involve my apprentice.

34:45.431 --> 34:49.696
It'’s time for you two to just
let things cool out, you know?

34:49.783 --> 34:51.871
Tell you what, Wyatt.
Why don'’t you walk Riley home?

34:51.958 --> 34:53.699
Make sure she doesn'’t get lost.

34:53.786 --> 34:55.571
- No way!
- No, thanks.

34:55.658 --> 34:58.574
No arguments!
You two get on with it.

35:03.013 --> 35:04.145
Where are you staying?

35:04.232 --> 35:05.929
The Jefferson Inn.

35:06.016 --> 35:10.412
Yeah, I know it.
It'’s on my way, so fine.

35:10.499 --> 35:11.718
Don'’t bother.

35:11.805 --> 35:12.936
Try pretending you'’re human.

35:13.023 --> 35:14.982
It might be interesting, hmm?

35:15.069 --> 35:17.463
Be nice to each other.

35:28.387 --> 35:30.824
He'’s gone. You don'’t actually
have to walk me home now.

35:30.911 --> 35:33.392
No, let'’s go.

35:39.659 --> 35:41.356
RILEY: All right.

35:41.443 --> 35:43.358
It'’s a cute little town,
I guess.

35:43.445 --> 35:45.360
Well, it'’s no New York.

35:45.447 --> 35:46.796
That'’s true.

35:46.883 --> 35:49.016
Not that I ever
get to enjoy it.

35:49.103 --> 35:52.280
I'’m always grabbing a cab
or meeting a deadline.

35:52.367 --> 35:56.066
Still, Christmas in New York.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.939
Must be grand. Gosh!

35:59.026 --> 36:02.856
That must be tough,
stuck here all by yourself

36:02.943 --> 36:05.032
without your friends
during the holidays.

36:05.119 --> 36:06.425
Yeah. I dreaded this trip.

36:06.512 --> 36:07.513
Oh, I bet.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.384
That'’d make me angry.

36:09.471 --> 36:13.083
Why would you say that?
I'’m not angry.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.346
Oh, no?

36:14.433 --> 36:15.912
No!

36:15.999 --> 36:18.088
Oh, okay. I'’m sorry.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.917
I guess you'’re not angry.

36:21.004 --> 36:25.226
So, um, what exactly
do you call that face?

36:25.313 --> 36:27.141
Okay, you are really
pushing my buttons.

36:27.228 --> 36:28.577
Now, why would I do
something like that?

36:28.664 --> 36:30.536
I don'’t know,
but I don'’t like it,

36:30.623 --> 36:31.711
so stop it.

36:31.798 --> 36:33.452
That'’s an order!

36:33.539 --> 36:36.150
[Scoffs]
That'’s an order?

36:36.237 --> 36:38.935
Oh, okay!
You know what?

36:39.022 --> 36:41.634
How about we just call a truce
for the rest of the evening?

36:41.721 --> 36:43.418
You stop giving me orders,

36:43.505 --> 36:44.637
and I'’ll stop pushing
your buttons. How'’s that?

36:44.724 --> 36:46.856
Fine.

36:46.943 --> 36:48.945
Truce.

36:50.033 --> 36:50.947
Truce.

36:53.776 --> 36:55.822
You know, at one time,

36:55.909 --> 36:59.521
I thought about moving
to New York to do what you do.

36:59.608 --> 37:01.306
And why didn'’t you?

37:01.393 --> 37:04.004
I started weighing things out,

37:04.091 --> 37:06.920
started thinking about
what it would really be like

37:07.007 --> 37:08.400
to leave this place.

37:08.487 --> 37:10.750
Yeah, but New York'’s
got everything.

37:10.837 --> 37:14.057
Skyscrapers that kiss the sky.

37:14.144 --> 37:16.669
Watching the ball drop
on New Year'’s Eve.

37:16.756 --> 37:19.541
Rats the size of dogs.

37:19.628 --> 37:21.804
Egos the size of elephants.

37:21.891 --> 37:24.198
Opportunity'’s always knocking.

37:24.285 --> 37:26.374
Maple trees turning gold
in autumn.

37:26.461 --> 37:28.550
Neighbors who actually
know each other.

37:28.637 --> 37:30.683
Smell of fresh pine
and campfires.

37:30.770 --> 37:32.424
Taste of fresh cider.

37:32.511 --> 37:34.991
You know, New York'’s
all still there, if you want it.

37:35.078 --> 37:37.646
See that'’s where
I think you'’re wrong.

37:37.733 --> 37:40.214
I think it'’s all
still right here.

37:40.301 --> 37:42.042
No offense to New York.

37:42.129 --> 37:45.088
Oh, please. You don'’t need
to worry about insulting me.

37:45.175 --> 37:46.568
It'’s not like
I'’m gonna move here

37:46.655 --> 37:48.178
and ruin your perfect
little landscape.

37:48.266 --> 37:51.269
Wow. You are tough.

37:51.356 --> 37:52.922
Yeah, I am.

37:53.009 --> 37:55.055
But I'’m not angry.

38:16.772 --> 38:17.860
Well, here we are.

38:17.947 --> 38:20.080
Yep, here we are.

38:21.821 --> 38:24.258
Thanks for walking me home.

38:24.345 --> 38:28.218
I don'’t think anybody'’s done
that for me since high school.

38:28.306 --> 38:31.831
It was, uh, it was nice.

38:31.918 --> 38:33.702
Seeing everything.

38:33.789 --> 38:35.269
Well, it'’s not New York.

38:35.356 --> 38:37.532
Yeah, you got that right.

38:37.619 --> 38:39.839
But, um...

38:39.926 --> 38:41.623
What?

38:41.710 --> 38:45.279
Oh, nothing. It...
It was nice.

38:45.366 --> 38:47.412
It'’s no trouble, boss.

38:47.499 --> 38:49.762
Don'’t start.

38:49.849 --> 38:52.634
I meant that in the nicest
possible way. Seriously.

38:53.983 --> 38:56.812
What a liar!
[Laughs]

38:58.248 --> 39:02.078
Anyway, uh, good night.

39:02.165 --> 39:04.516
Good night.

39:06.909 --> 39:08.998
- [Phone ringing]
- Sorry.

39:09.085 --> 39:09.999
Oh.

39:10.086 --> 39:11.261
Sorry.

39:12.828 --> 39:14.482
Can you hold on?

39:14.569 --> 39:17.398
Um, thank you so much again.

39:17.485 --> 39:19.705
I'’ll see you tomorrow morning.

39:19.792 --> 39:22.055
Yeah, sure,
bright and early.

39:22.142 --> 39:23.230
Okay.

39:26.102 --> 39:27.452
Hi.

39:40.203 --> 39:42.815
Hey, you.
How'’s it going?

39:42.902 --> 39:45.861
It'’s good. Long days,
paperwork in triplicate,

39:45.948 --> 39:48.081
living the midtown life.
How'’s Vermont?

39:48.168 --> 39:50.605
It'’s, uh...

39:50.692 --> 39:52.955
okay.

39:53.042 --> 39:55.523
What'’s wrong? You didn'’t
get overly anxious

39:55.610 --> 39:57.351
and already fire everybody,
did you?

39:57.438 --> 39:59.614
No, of course not.

39:59.701 --> 40:03.052
Things are going pretty much
according to Bullock'’s plan.

40:03.139 --> 40:04.619
He seems happy.

40:04.706 --> 40:07.883
That'’s great.
So what'’s the problem?

40:07.970 --> 40:10.799
I don'’t know.
I'’m just starting to feel

40:10.886 --> 40:13.411
like maybe we shouldn'’t
be in such a rush here

40:13.498 --> 40:16.065
to pull the plug,
you know?

40:16.152 --> 40:18.546
Maybe this is a mistake.

40:18.633 --> 40:20.418
What do you mean?

40:20.505 --> 40:24.204
David, this whole community is
based around this one company.

40:24.291 --> 40:26.424
Shutting it down
might kill the entire town.

40:26.511 --> 40:30.079
Don'’t let this Christmas
nonsense get you all fuzzy.

40:30.166 --> 40:33.692
Don'’t make this complicated.

40:33.779 --> 40:36.434
I already made things
complicated.

40:42.222 --> 40:44.006
Any word from Riley yet?

40:44.093 --> 40:47.140
No, sir. I keep trying,
but there'’s been no answer.

40:47.227 --> 40:49.142
Well, try again,
and when you finally locate her,

40:49.229 --> 40:50.970
don'’t let her get away.

40:51.057 --> 40:53.581
Yes, sir. Yes, I will
keep trying, absolutely,

40:53.668 --> 40:55.017
but I do have to tell you,

40:55.104 --> 40:56.889
something just doesn'’t
smell right.

40:56.976 --> 40:59.761
Well, it'’s Vermont.
It'’s probably just the cheese.

41:01.415 --> 41:05.071
Yes! The cheese.
Good thinking, sir.

41:11.338 --> 41:13.209
Hi, Mom.

41:13.296 --> 41:16.909
Well, I just got of the phone
with Kathleen Fogerty,

41:16.996 --> 41:20.347
and she said that she saw you
walking through town last night

41:20.434 --> 41:22.567
with a very attractive
young woman.

41:22.654 --> 41:24.699
What? Who?

41:24.786 --> 41:27.746
- Oh, uh, Riley.
- Riley.

41:27.833 --> 41:29.269
Riley, Riley.
Do I know a Riley?

41:29.356 --> 41:31.401
She'’s the consultant
I told you about

41:31.489 --> 41:33.534
from the holding company,
remember?

41:33.621 --> 41:35.449
So when do I get to meet her?

41:35.536 --> 41:37.930
She'’s only here for a couple
days to help the company, Mom.

41:38.017 --> 41:40.715
You know, Kathleen made it sound
a lot friendlier than that.

41:40.802 --> 41:43.631
Yeah, well Kathleen has been
re-gifting the same present

41:43.718 --> 41:45.154
since 1982.

41:45.241 --> 41:46.242
Good point.

41:46.329 --> 41:47.853
But is she cute?

41:47.940 --> 41:49.376
I don'’t know.

41:49.463 --> 41:51.552
Wyatt!

41:51.639 --> 41:54.729
Yeah, okay,
maybe she'’s a little cute.

41:54.816 --> 41:56.470
Ah, well, bring her over.

41:56.557 --> 41:58.559
I'’ll make my pineapple
upside-down cake.

41:58.646 --> 42:00.387
- Mom.
- Pineapple right-side-up cake.

42:00.474 --> 42:01.867
I don'’t care.
Whatever she wants.

42:01.954 --> 42:04.304
It'’s just business.
Besides, she'’s--

42:04.391 --> 42:05.305
What?

42:05.392 --> 42:07.220
Smart, driven?

42:07.307 --> 42:09.048
Frustrating.

42:09.135 --> 42:10.223
If she'’s getting
under your skin this much,

42:10.310 --> 42:11.833
she must be doing
something right,

42:11.920 --> 42:13.443
just like what'’s her name,

42:13.531 --> 42:16.098
the one you met skiing
on Ward Hill.

42:16.185 --> 42:17.186
Susan.

42:17.273 --> 42:18.492
Susan, yes.

42:18.579 --> 42:19.841
You said
you couldn'’t stand her

42:19.928 --> 42:21.147
and two weeks later,
she moved in.

42:21.234 --> 42:22.801
Yeah, and a week later,
she moved out.

42:22.888 --> 42:23.932
Ma, I oughta get back to work.

42:24.019 --> 42:26.674
All right.
I'’ll let you go.

42:26.761 --> 42:28.546
- Thank you.
- But you could send a picture.

42:28.633 --> 42:30.069
- I'’m hanging up now.
- Bye.

42:30.156 --> 42:32.201
- Yep, I'’m hanging up. Bye.
- Picture!

42:32.288 --> 42:33.333
EDY: Steve'’s ready for you.

42:33.420 --> 42:34.552
Okay, I'’ll be right there!

42:34.639 --> 42:36.423
- Morning.
- Morning.

42:36.510 --> 42:38.643
I have a big task.
Up for the challenge?

42:38.730 --> 42:40.688
- Try me.
- I need sales reports.

42:40.775 --> 42:43.343
I want to know exactly where
this company sits financially.

42:43.430 --> 42:45.040
You got it.

42:45.127 --> 42:46.651
- Steve?
- Yes.

42:46.738 --> 42:48.174
I want to see
what you'’ve been working on,

42:48.261 --> 42:49.915
along with your ten best
and most recent sketches.

42:50.002 --> 42:50.916
Sure thing.

42:51.003 --> 42:52.570
Edy.

42:52.657 --> 42:55.050
Edy, I need all
the information we have

42:55.137 --> 42:56.530
on OutWear'’s
current offerings,

42:56.617 --> 42:57.749
costs of good sold,

42:57.836 --> 42:59.489
products ranked
by profitability,

42:59.577 --> 43:01.622
our best markets,
demographically speaking.

43:01.709 --> 43:03.406
- The works.
- Aye-Aye.

43:03.493 --> 43:06.148
What'’s going on?

43:06.235 --> 43:08.847
We'’re not just gonna
save this company.

43:08.934 --> 43:11.023
We'’re gonna make it a success.

43:11.110 --> 43:12.764
Wow.

43:19.466 --> 43:21.642
These designs are boring.

43:21.729 --> 43:23.731
Nothing is popping.

43:23.818 --> 43:27.996
A jogging cell phone holster?
Urban hiking trainers?

43:28.083 --> 43:30.129
Why are all of these products
being designed

43:30.216 --> 43:32.261
for a metropolitan market?

43:32.348 --> 43:34.481
The money is in the big cities
these days.

43:34.568 --> 43:36.918
Where are we with the numbers?

43:44.143 --> 43:45.361
This is accurate?

43:45.448 --> 43:47.276
Near as I can tell.

43:47.363 --> 43:50.845
OutWear needs to make $2 million
by the end of the quarter.

43:50.932 --> 43:54.544
If we'’re gonna come out ahead?
Yeah.

43:54.632 --> 43:56.329
Or we close.

43:56.416 --> 43:58.200
That'’s the reality.

43:58.287 --> 44:01.943
How are we gonna make
$2 million by Christmas?

44:02.030 --> 44:03.945
We have to launch
a new product.

44:04.032 --> 44:06.731
Launch a new product?
In weeks?

44:06.818 --> 44:08.254
No, that'’s impossible.

44:08.341 --> 44:10.343
Well, with we currently have,
I'’d agree,

44:10.430 --> 44:12.954
but we have to come up
with something fresh.

44:13.041 --> 44:15.783
The first jacket
that you designed for OutWear

44:15.870 --> 44:17.785
was a groundbreaking success.

44:17.872 --> 44:19.395
What changed?

44:19.482 --> 44:21.180
That was decades ago.

44:21.267 --> 44:24.183
They don'’t make things
the same way today.

44:24.270 --> 44:27.099
The jacket was rugged.
It was built to last a lifetime.

44:27.186 --> 44:31.233
And if it got damaged,
we'’d fix it for free.

44:31.320 --> 44:35.194
It was more than just a jacket.
It was my word of honor.

44:35.281 --> 44:39.589
Fashion changes,
but style doesn'’t.

44:39.677 --> 44:43.942
I just feel like
we'’re missing something.

44:46.945 --> 44:48.686
I need to think.

- Pretty, isn'’t it?
- Excuse me?

47:28.889 --> 47:31.849
The rose, it'’s pretty, huh?

47:31.936 --> 47:36.288
A single white rose blossoming
in the middle of winter.

47:36.375 --> 47:38.638
That bush is over
a hundred years old.

47:38.725 --> 47:41.162
It produces
only one new rose a season.

47:41.249 --> 47:44.731
What did Nick say?

47:44.818 --> 47:48.996
What'’s old is new again.

47:50.432 --> 47:53.479
What'’s old is new again.

47:55.655 --> 47:57.178
That'’s it.

47:57.265 --> 47:59.137
That'’s what?

47:59.224 --> 48:02.792
A rose is a rose is a rose.

48:06.492 --> 48:08.537
RILEY: The answer has been
in front of us all along.

48:08.624 --> 48:09.756
Okay, I'’m listening.

48:09.843 --> 48:11.192
Your products have
all gone astray.

48:11.279 --> 48:12.759
They don'’t represent you
anymore.

48:12.846 --> 48:14.282
- They don'’t?
- No, they don'’t.

48:14.369 --> 48:15.849
How do you get people
invested in something

48:15.936 --> 48:17.982
if you'’re not invested in it
yourselves?

48:18.069 --> 48:20.332
You have to get back
to what works.

48:20.419 --> 48:22.812
You don'’t export
any old winter jacket.

48:22.900 --> 48:26.294
No, no. You don'’t export
any old winter boots.

48:26.381 --> 48:28.775
You export Vermont.

48:28.862 --> 48:32.561
The shine of an apple.
The sparkle of the night sky.

48:32.648 --> 48:35.347
The amber shade
of maple syrup.

48:35.434 --> 48:37.653
Every thing that you love
about Vermont.

48:37.740 --> 48:41.179
That is what OutWear is.

48:41.266 --> 48:43.703
What'’s old is new again.

48:43.790 --> 48:46.358
I'’m totally intrigued.

48:46.445 --> 48:48.099
Come on. We got a lot
of planning to do.

48:48.186 --> 48:50.014
What exactly
are we planning again?

48:50.101 --> 48:52.494
A Christmas miracle.

48:52.581 --> 48:53.452
Let'’s go!

49:07.161 --> 49:11.078
So today I saw something
absolutely fascinating.

49:11.165 --> 49:14.386
While I was on my walk,
I saw a couple,

49:14.473 --> 49:16.692
and the girl was enjoying
an ice cream cone

49:16.779 --> 49:18.172
in the freezing cold,

49:18.259 --> 49:22.176
while the boy was drinking
hot chocolate.

49:22.263 --> 49:24.874
So what does this all mean?

49:24.962 --> 49:28.791
Well, it means
that people are unique.

49:28.878 --> 49:30.489
No two are alike,

49:30.576 --> 49:34.014
in spite of what some people
would have me believe.

49:35.494 --> 49:40.499
And then I saw
this single white rose

49:40.586 --> 49:42.936
blooming
in the middle of winter

49:43.023 --> 49:44.807
from a bush that was over
a hundred years old.

49:44.894 --> 49:47.767
And that'’s when it hit me.

49:47.854 --> 49:49.987
We need to stop looking
at the future

49:50.074 --> 49:53.077
and start looking
at the past.

49:53.164 --> 49:55.514
You used to export
a lifestyle,

49:55.601 --> 49:58.038
and now you'’re just
spinning wool.

49:58.125 --> 49:59.561
So we'’ve gotta
turn back the clock.

49:59.648 --> 50:01.868
You'’ve lost me.

50:01.955 --> 50:03.391
Me too.

50:03.478 --> 50:05.480
Okay, it'’s simple.

50:05.567 --> 50:07.917
I am proud to introduce
the flagship item

50:08.005 --> 50:09.789
of OutWear'’s new holiday line,

50:09.876 --> 50:13.967
and I found it right here
under our noses.

50:14.054 --> 50:15.795
- Riley!
- Please, Nick.

50:15.882 --> 50:19.494
Apprentices will only speak
when spoken to.

50:22.019 --> 50:24.499
Now, we'’re not gonna
reinvent the wheel here.

50:24.586 --> 50:26.240
We'’re just gonna
roll out the old one.

50:26.327 --> 50:29.243
We'’re gonna bust out of here
with the very first item

50:29.330 --> 50:32.812
ever produced by OutWear
fifty years ago.

50:37.121 --> 50:41.647
The 50th Anniversary
Limited Edition holiday sweater.

50:41.734 --> 50:44.954
It'’s the very sweater that
launched the OutWear empire.

50:45.042 --> 50:47.696
We can even use the same ad.

50:47.783 --> 50:48.784
It'’s unique.

50:48.871 --> 50:50.569
It'’s collectible.

50:50.656 --> 50:51.787
It'’s retro.

50:51.874 --> 50:54.225
It'’s Nick'’s.

50:55.704 --> 50:56.836
I like it.

50:56.923 --> 50:58.011
Me too.

50:58.098 --> 50:59.012
It'’s outstanding.

50:59.099 --> 51:00.187
I'’d wear it.

51:00.274 --> 51:01.797
Well?

51:01.884 --> 51:05.410
You sure do remind me
of somebody very special.

51:05.497 --> 51:07.455
Is that a yes?

51:07.542 --> 51:10.415
How can I stop you?
I'’m just an apprentice.

51:10.502 --> 51:11.981
[Laughter]

51:12.069 --> 51:14.201
This is very true.

51:14.288 --> 51:15.724
Okay, everybody,
let'’s get to work.

51:15.811 --> 51:17.813
We'’ve only got a few weeks
till Christmas.

51:24.820 --> 51:26.735
Let'’s get to work, guys,
all right?

51:26.822 --> 51:27.823
Okay.

51:27.910 --> 51:29.521
[Dog barks]

51:30.739 --> 51:32.828
Wow. I'’m impressed.

51:32.915 --> 51:34.613
You really mean that?

51:34.700 --> 51:37.268
Yeah, I'’m amazed that
you took everything in,

51:37.355 --> 51:40.706
processed it,
and came up with all that.

51:40.793 --> 51:43.622
Well, it wasn'’t all me.

51:43.709 --> 51:44.840
I mean, Christmas sweaters
have been a novelty craze

51:44.927 --> 51:46.625
for a while now.

51:46.712 --> 51:49.149
I just realized that OutWear
could take a step forward

51:49.236 --> 51:51.238
by taking a step back.

51:51.325 --> 51:55.721
Back to Nick'’s original design
and Vermont in a box.

51:55.808 --> 51:58.332
A single item built
to last a lifetime,

51:58.419 --> 52:02.945
one that evokes warm nights
by the fire and good friends.

52:03.032 --> 52:05.339
Romance.

52:05.426 --> 52:07.080
Yeah, but still,
I'’m a little embarrassed

52:07.167 --> 52:08.908
that I didn'’t
come up with it myself.

52:08.995 --> 52:12.781
That'’s my job, to figure out
how to save this company.

52:12.868 --> 52:15.001
Maybe I shouldn'’t be in charge.

52:15.088 --> 52:16.350
Don'’t say that.

52:16.437 --> 52:19.962
I just saw the rose,
that'’s all.

52:20.049 --> 52:21.181
Don'’t get me wrong.
It'’s a good idea.

52:21.268 --> 52:22.922
It really is.

52:24.750 --> 52:26.708
Congratulations.

52:38.416 --> 52:41.070
We'’re moving the launch up.
Yeah, that'’s right.

52:41.158 --> 52:43.943
We'’ll need full exposure on all
social media sites immediately.

52:44.030 --> 52:48.426
Yeah, we'’re gonna want
10,000 likes for starters.

52:48.513 --> 52:51.124
That'’ll get us on every
social media feed.

52:51.211 --> 52:52.995
Oh, and make sure
we'’re trending.

52:53.082 --> 52:56.477
We have to be trending
by 5:00, okay?

52:56.564 --> 52:58.218
All right, get back
to me with the good word

52:58.305 --> 52:59.480
as soon as you can.

52:59.567 --> 53:00.699
All right, thanks.

53:02.004 --> 53:03.789
Well?

53:03.876 --> 53:06.095
We'’ve got all the major
social media outlets covered,

53:06.183 --> 53:08.272
and it'’s getting
massive attention.

53:08.359 --> 53:09.360
It'’s moving fast.

53:09.447 --> 53:10.752
What about Internet sales?

53:10.839 --> 53:12.841
Our business website
has been updated,

53:12.928 --> 53:15.061
and it'’s moving strong.

53:16.802 --> 53:18.673
Pre-sales have been rolling in.

53:18.760 --> 53:19.979
Pre-sales?

53:20.066 --> 53:22.547
January, February.

53:22.634 --> 53:24.418
But what about here and now?

53:24.505 --> 53:26.203
Well, we'’re still
getting those orders,

53:26.290 --> 53:28.466
but since we'’re so late
in the Christmas buying season,

53:28.553 --> 53:30.468
most of the retailers
are thinking long term.

53:30.555 --> 53:32.687
Long term? I like that.

53:32.774 --> 53:34.646
Well, that'’s great,
but we need immediate sales.

53:34.733 --> 53:37.039
I just placed a huge order
with our off-site manufacturer.

53:37.126 --> 53:39.477
We'’re gonna be
swimming in sweaters.

53:39.564 --> 53:41.522
What about
our buyers database?

53:41.609 --> 53:43.959
We sent a blast out
to all 20,000 buyers.

53:44.046 --> 53:46.527
Online wholesalers,
boutique outlets.

53:46.614 --> 53:48.747
Trust me. It'’s working.

53:48.834 --> 53:52.185
I hear you, but is it
working fast enough?

53:52.272 --> 53:55.319
I think we may
need a miracle.

53:55.406 --> 53:57.234
Well, it is Christmas.
If ever there was a time

53:57.321 --> 53:58.844
that miracles happen,
this is it.

53:58.931 --> 54:00.062
Keep on it.

54:00.149 --> 54:01.847
Yes, sir.

54:03.327 --> 54:05.677
Hey, it'’s Steve from OutWear.

54:05.764 --> 54:07.548
Yeah, I wanted to see
if we could get you

54:07.635 --> 54:10.029
to take some of these
commemorative sweaters.

54:10.116 --> 54:11.683
They'’re the hottest thing
this season.

54:13.511 --> 54:15.904
Christmas sweaters?
Are you crazy?

54:15.991 --> 54:17.732
It'’s just sweaters to start.

54:17.819 --> 54:20.169
I'’m already looking ahead
to non-holiday vintage wear.

54:20.257 --> 54:23.216
I really think that this is
gonna turn OutWear around.

54:23.303 --> 54:25.479
I can'’t believe
what I'’m hearing.

54:25.566 --> 54:27.786
I know, but maybe
it'’s the right thing.

54:27.873 --> 54:29.962
Trust me, it'’s not.

54:30.049 --> 54:33.835
The right thing to do is what
Bullock sent you there to do.

54:33.922 --> 54:36.925
What'’s he gonna say
when he finds out?

54:37.012 --> 54:38.449
I don'’t know.

54:38.536 --> 54:40.799
I guess I'’ll weather that storm
when it arrives.

54:40.886 --> 54:42.670
No, Riley, you won'’t.

54:42.757 --> 54:44.542
You'’ll get your head cut off
along with the rest of them,

54:44.629 --> 54:46.500
and then you'’ll all be
unemployed.

54:46.587 --> 54:49.111
That'’s not the girl
I thought you were.

54:49.198 --> 54:52.463
I'’m sorry that I'’m not living up
to your standards, David.

54:52.550 --> 54:54.378
I'’m sure you can find
someone who will.

54:54.465 --> 54:58.599
Riley, their problems
are not your problems.

54:58.686 --> 55:01.472
But they will be soon
if you don'’t stop this.

55:01.559 --> 55:02.995
This is a stupid move.

55:03.082 --> 55:04.997
Not smart at all.

55:05.084 --> 55:07.173
Stupid? Really?

55:07.260 --> 55:09.697
Well, I guess we'’ll see,
won'’t we?

55:17.009 --> 55:18.663
ANNOUNCER: OutWear'’s classic
Christmas sweater returns

55:18.750 --> 55:20.317
just in time
for the holidays

55:20.404 --> 55:23.624
in a special 50th Anniversary
Lmited Edition.

55:23.711 --> 55:29.151
♪♪

55:29.238 --> 55:31.415
Enjoy the warmth,

55:31.502 --> 55:35.636
that has distinguished OutWear
products for a half a century.

55:35.723 --> 55:39.248
Styles may come and go,

Yes, sir, I know,

something good, and I took it.

You know that. That is how

It'’s been an honor
working with all you guys.

01:07:23.778 --> 01:07:26.781
I want to thank you for your
hard work and your dedication,

01:07:26.868 --> 01:07:29.088
and I'’m proud of all of you.

01:07:29.175 --> 01:07:31.221
We'’re proud of you.

01:07:31.308 --> 01:07:33.179
We got one last party
to have under this roof,

01:07:33.266 --> 01:07:36.226
so let'’s make it a good one.

01:07:36.313 --> 01:07:38.271
Yes, absolutely.

01:07:38.358 --> 01:07:39.881
- We'’re with you.
- Yes.

01:07:39.968 --> 01:07:40.969
Let'’s do it.

01:07:45.583 --> 01:07:48.368
RILEY: Oh, sales have stalled.

01:07:48.455 --> 01:07:50.501
Don'’t look so happy
to see me.

01:07:50.588 --> 01:07:52.242
I might get used to it.

01:07:52.329 --> 01:07:53.808
Oh.

01:07:53.895 --> 01:07:55.680
Earth to Riley!

01:07:55.767 --> 01:07:57.986
I'’m sorry.

01:07:58.074 --> 01:07:59.640
What?

01:07:59.727 --> 01:08:02.643
Are you still thinking about
the Land of Misfit Toys?

01:08:02.730 --> 01:08:04.819
Don'’t call it that.

01:08:04.906 --> 01:08:07.257
And yes, I am.

01:08:07.344 --> 01:08:08.954
I told you not to get
too attached.

01:08:09.041 --> 01:08:10.434
Now look what'’s happening.

01:08:10.521 --> 01:08:13.132
Lucky for you, your little spike
in sweater sales

01:08:13.219 --> 01:08:15.047
will help you find a job
somewhere else.

01:08:15.134 --> 01:08:17.310
I don'’t know.
It'’s not really about the job.

01:08:17.397 --> 01:08:18.790
Who cares?

01:08:18.877 --> 01:08:20.705
I do. I care.

01:08:20.792 --> 01:08:23.099
I wanted to help them, David.

01:08:23.185 --> 01:08:25.492
I wanted to help them
so much.

01:08:25.578 --> 01:08:29.104
But you didn'’t,
so end of story.

01:08:29.192 --> 01:08:32.064
I learned so much about myself
while I was there.

01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:35.763
Like part of me
that has been missing,

01:08:35.850 --> 01:08:38.897
that I didn'’t even know
existed.

01:08:38.984 --> 01:08:41.595
I'’m sorry.
What are you saying?

01:08:41.682 --> 01:08:46.165
I'’m saying that
I am not like you.

01:08:46.252 --> 01:08:49.689
I thought maybe I was,
but I'’m not,

01:08:49.777 --> 01:08:51.214
and I don'’t ever want to be.

01:08:51.301 --> 01:08:53.694
What? Riley...

01:08:53.781 --> 01:08:56.957
Those people,
they help each other.

01:08:57.045 --> 01:09:00.527
Whatever world this is
that we'’re living in,

01:09:00.613 --> 01:09:03.617
where we only look out
for ourselves,

01:09:03.703 --> 01:09:06.185
I'’m done.

01:09:06.272 --> 01:09:08.666
I don'’t want to be
part of it anymore.

01:09:10.189 --> 01:09:11.277
You can'’t be serious.

01:09:11.363 --> 01:09:12.756
I should go.

01:09:12.844 --> 01:09:15.151
I can'’t believe
you'’re doing this.

01:09:15.238 --> 01:09:17.501
What'’s gotten into you,
Riley?

01:09:17.587 --> 01:09:19.633
Christmas.

01:09:21.895 --> 01:09:24.247
Christmas has gotten into me.

01:09:37.042 --> 01:09:37.999
Riley?

01:09:38.086 --> 01:09:39.957
Riley Thomas!

01:09:40.045 --> 01:09:41.828
Dana, hi.

01:09:41.916 --> 01:09:44.702
I thought that might be you.
I heard you were out of town.

01:09:44.788 --> 01:09:47.444
Yeah, I was.
I just got back.

01:09:48.662 --> 01:09:49.968
Beautiful sweater.

01:09:50.055 --> 01:09:52.578
Thank you.
My nephew gave it to me.

01:09:52.666 --> 01:09:54.625
Keeps me warm on a cold day.

01:09:54.712 --> 01:09:56.148
I know the feeling.

01:09:56.235 --> 01:09:57.932
Well, you'’re back
just in time.

01:09:58.019 --> 01:10:00.631
It'’s nice to be where
the heart is for the holidays.

01:10:00.718 --> 01:10:02.546
Yeah.

01:10:02.633 --> 01:10:05.201
I was gonna go into Delorie'’s.
Care to join me?

01:10:05.288 --> 01:10:07.115
No, thank you.
I actually just left.

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:09.074
All right.
Well, maybe another time.

01:10:09.161 --> 01:10:10.858
Yeah, I'’d like that.

01:10:10.945 --> 01:10:12.077
Merry Christmas, dear.

01:10:12.164 --> 01:10:13.383
Merry Christmas to you too.

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:19.215
Dana?

01:10:23.262 --> 01:10:24.916
There'’s something I'’d like
to talk to you about.

01:10:25.003 --> 01:10:27.701
Just not here.
It'’s a little crowded tonight.

01:10:27.788 --> 01:10:29.355
All right,
well, lead the way.

01:10:34.491 --> 01:10:36.144
I think I see a booth
over there.

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:37.581
Perfect.

01:10:40.148 --> 01:10:41.628
So have you met
with Preston yet?

01:10:41.715 --> 01:10:43.804
I know he'’s been anxious
to see you.

01:10:43.891 --> 01:10:46.198
No. I haven'’t dared
show my face.

01:10:46.285 --> 01:10:47.852
Oh? Why?

01:10:47.939 --> 01:10:50.289
Well, he'’s gonna fire me
the second he sees me.

01:10:50.376 --> 01:10:51.508
Oh, no.

01:10:53.727 --> 01:10:55.294
There you go.

01:10:55.381 --> 01:10:57.644
Would you ladies like to start
with something to drink?

01:10:57.731 --> 01:10:59.864
Oh, just coffee for me,
thanks.

01:10:59.951 --> 01:11:00.952
Me too.

01:11:02.649 --> 01:11:04.477
It'’s all right.

01:11:04.564 --> 01:11:06.827
I asked for it.

01:11:06.914 --> 01:11:09.003
Actually, I begged for it.

01:11:09.090 --> 01:11:12.398
But you know what?
I don'’t care.

01:11:12.485 --> 01:11:15.619
I made a choice,
and I stuck with it.

01:11:15.706 --> 01:11:19.492
Should I ask?
What exactly did you do?

01:11:19.579 --> 01:11:22.887
Dana, you and I don'’t know
each other that well.

01:11:22.974 --> 01:11:25.063
We'’ve had some business dealings

01:11:25.150 --> 01:11:28.806
since your firm decided
to invest in Bullock & Barnes.

01:11:28.893 --> 01:11:32.244
We have, and I'’ve enjoyed
watching your progress.

01:11:32.331 --> 01:11:34.246
You show a lot of potential.

01:11:34.333 --> 01:11:35.465
Thank you.

01:11:35.552 --> 01:11:37.728
But that is behind me now.

01:11:37.815 --> 01:11:40.992
I took on an assignment,

01:11:41.079 --> 01:11:44.212
one that was pretty important
to Mr. Bullock.

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:45.866
He put a lot of faith in me,

01:11:45.953 --> 01:11:50.567
and at the time,
it seemed pretty cut and dry.

01:11:50.654 --> 01:11:52.177
But it wasn'’t.

01:11:52.264 --> 01:11:54.005
No, it wasn'’t.

01:11:54.092 --> 01:11:56.312
I didn'’t count
on the human element.

01:11:56.399 --> 01:11:59.750
The faces and the smiles.

01:11:59.837 --> 01:12:01.404
The very lives of the people.

01:12:01.491 --> 01:12:04.624
The lives that I was
about to turn upside-down.

01:12:04.711 --> 01:12:06.931
It can be pretty tough.

01:12:07.018 --> 01:12:10.413
It was impossible.

01:12:15.505 --> 01:12:17.158
Thanks.

01:12:17.245 --> 01:12:20.161
Dana, I'’m not
the same person that I was

01:12:20.248 --> 01:12:21.989
when I left a few weeks ago.

01:12:22.076 --> 01:12:24.905
What'’s changed?

01:12:24.992 --> 01:12:26.907
It'’s difficult
to put into words.

01:12:26.994 --> 01:12:31.521
I just don'’t feel
the same anymore.

01:12:31.608 --> 01:12:35.786
Despite what I had promised
Mr. Bullock, I did the opposite.

01:12:35.873 --> 01:12:40.399
I tried to right the ship
and save the company.

01:12:40.486 --> 01:12:42.053
I almost did it too.

01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:44.751
But that isn'’t why
Bullock sent you there.

01:12:44.838 --> 01:12:46.797
I came that close.

01:12:46.884 --> 01:12:50.366
A bold move, as they say.

01:12:50.453 --> 01:12:53.064
Sorry it didn'’t work out.

01:12:53.151 --> 01:12:56.763
Now, Riley,

01:12:56.850 --> 01:12:59.723
how can I
help you with this?

Hello?

How is that big
Christmas party going?

01:13:32.146 --> 01:13:33.278
Oh, fine.

01:13:33.365 --> 01:13:35.411
I was just, uh...

01:13:35.498 --> 01:13:37.500
I was just finishing up
some work.

01:13:37.587 --> 01:13:39.284
Wyatt, it'’s Christmas Eve.

01:13:39.371 --> 01:13:42.069
Believe me, I know.

01:13:42.156 --> 01:13:43.810
Honey, you will
get through this.

01:13:43.897 --> 01:13:45.421
You always do.

01:13:45.508 --> 01:13:47.335
It'’s not that. It'’s just...

01:13:47.423 --> 01:13:50.338
everyone was depending on me,
you know?

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:53.559
When Nick hired me
to take over,

01:13:53.646 --> 01:13:55.169
he trusted me
with his life'’s work,

01:13:55.256 --> 01:13:58.259
with the town'’s work,
and I feel like...

01:13:58.346 --> 01:13:59.609
I feel like I let him down.

01:13:59.696 --> 01:14:01.306
I feel like
I let everybody down.

01:14:01.393 --> 01:14:03.917
Honey, anybody else would have
walked away from this

01:14:04.004 --> 01:14:05.658
a long time ago,
but not you.

01:14:05.745 --> 01:14:07.791
You did what you always do.

01:14:07.878 --> 01:14:09.445
You just hung in there
till the bitter end

01:14:09.532 --> 01:14:11.577
because you'’re a fighter,
Wyatt.

01:14:11.664 --> 01:14:13.492
And they are darn lucky
to have you.

01:14:13.579 --> 01:14:15.320
Sure doesn'’t feel like it.

01:14:15.407 --> 01:14:16.930
Look, I know it'’s a shame,

01:14:17.017 --> 01:14:20.630
and this Riley girl
sounded really special.

01:14:20.717 --> 01:14:22.762
[Chuckles]

01:14:22.849 --> 01:14:25.765
I really don'’t know
what to do anymore, Mom.

01:14:25.852 --> 01:14:29.639
Riley'’s gone.
I'’m unemployed.

01:14:29.726 --> 01:14:31.554
Well, you still have me.

01:14:33.207 --> 01:14:34.905
Thanks.

01:14:34.992 --> 01:14:37.081
And you are still
coming over tomorrow, right?

01:14:37.168 --> 01:14:42.521
I mean, Uncle Gene is making
his famous homemade eggnog.

01:14:42.608 --> 01:14:45.089
Sounds delicious.

01:14:45.176 --> 01:14:47.918
All right,
I'’ll see you tomorrow then.

01:14:48.005 --> 01:14:50.050
- Sure.
- And you know what?

01:14:50.137 --> 01:14:53.140
You might still get
that Christmas miracle.

01:14:53.227 --> 01:14:54.968
Merry Christmas.

01:14:55.055 --> 01:14:57.362
- Merry Christmas.
- I love you, Mom.

01:14:57.449 --> 01:14:58.711
Mwah!

01:15:06.284 --> 01:15:07.938
Wyatt.

01:15:09.635 --> 01:15:11.681
Where you been hiding?
Come on.

01:15:11.768 --> 01:15:14.292
Oh, you know how it is.

01:15:14.379 --> 01:15:16.860
Wow! You look festive.

01:15:16.947 --> 01:15:19.906
You like that? I don'’t know
if you noticed or not,

01:15:19.993 --> 01:15:22.430
but there'’s a little party
going on downstairs.

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:23.910
I know, I know.

01:15:23.997 --> 01:15:27.174
I was just following up
on our Internet stats.

01:15:27.261 --> 01:15:29.133
We'’re so close.

01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:32.919
Yeah, close.
But enough is enough.

01:15:33.006 --> 01:15:34.965
Look, people are
waiting for you.

01:15:35.052 --> 01:15:37.315
It'’s getting late.
You need to show your face.

01:15:37.402 --> 01:15:41.145
- But I don'’t--
- There is no but.

01:15:41.232 --> 01:15:43.582
You gave it your best.

01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:47.455
And for what it'’s worth,
I think Riley did too.

01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:48.979
We all did.

01:15:49.066 --> 01:15:50.633
Riley?

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:51.808
You too, huh?

01:15:52.939 --> 01:15:54.550
Yeah.

01:15:54.637 --> 01:15:56.639
Go.

Look, all your friends
are asking for you,

01:15:58.858 --> 01:16:00.338
and Nick'’s
running out of excuses.

01:16:00.425 --> 01:16:02.122
All right.

01:16:02.209 --> 01:16:03.994
Might as well go out
with a bang, right?

01:16:04.081 --> 01:16:05.125
Or two.

01:16:05.212 --> 01:16:06.518
Or two.

01:16:16.528 --> 01:16:18.051
Merry Christmas, Wyatt.

01:16:22.839 --> 01:16:25.668
I started this company
50 years ago,

01:16:25.755 --> 01:16:29.280
and if tonight'’s the night
it all closes down,

01:16:29.367 --> 01:16:30.716
I don'’t want it
to be with tears.

01:16:30.803 --> 01:16:32.457
I want it to be
with a toast.

heard this story,

01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:49.169
but for those who haven'’t,
it'’s a true story.

01:16:49.256 --> 01:16:52.999
Way back in the first winter
of World War I,

01:16:53.086 --> 01:16:58.788
soldiers from both sides
ceased fire for a whole day

01:16:58.875 --> 01:17:02.269
so that they could come together
to celebrate Christmas.

01:17:02.356 --> 01:17:07.013
Kind of reminds me
that wherever we are,

01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:10.190
we can always use
a little Christmas spirit.

01:17:10.277 --> 01:17:13.193
Took me a while
to remember that.

01:17:15.108 --> 01:17:16.153
So...

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:19.112
50 years ago,

01:17:19.199 --> 01:17:25.379
I started this company
with a sweater and a coat,

01:17:25.466 --> 01:17:30.123
and I never imagined that
one day it would encompass

01:17:30.210 --> 01:17:33.910
all of you
and your dedication,

01:17:33.997 --> 01:17:38.610
your creative energy
and your wonderful work.

01:17:38.697 --> 01:17:44.137
So I say, as we stagger through
the final hour,

01:17:44.224 --> 01:17:48.620
let'’s put aside any regrets
we have about what we didn'’t do,

01:17:48.707 --> 01:17:53.320
and let'’s celebrate with joy for
what we have achieved together.

01:17:53.407 --> 01:17:54.670
Merry Christmas, everybody.

01:17:54.757 --> 01:17:57.890
- Merry Christmas!
- Hear, hear!

01:17:57.977 --> 01:18:01.677
Bullock wanted this place
shut down by Christmas.

01:18:01.764 --> 01:18:06.290
So with the tolling
of the clock,

01:18:06.377 --> 01:18:07.595
OutWear is officially...

01:18:07.683 --> 01:18:09.119
RILEY: Open for business.

01:18:10.773 --> 01:18:11.687
Riley?

01:18:13.427 --> 01:18:16.517
Riley?

01:18:16.604 --> 01:18:19.346
I'’m so sorry.
I should have listened to you.

01:18:19.433 --> 01:18:22.045
I should have told you.
I'’m sorry too.

01:18:22.132 --> 01:18:23.699
But what are you doing here?

01:18:23.786 --> 01:18:27.398
I came back
because we'’re not done.

01:18:27.485 --> 01:18:29.313
It'’s not over.

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:32.185
Unfortunately, my dear,
it is done.

01:18:32.272 --> 01:18:34.144
You may have come back
for nothing.

01:18:34.231 --> 01:18:37.669
Actually, I came back
for everything.

01:18:37.756 --> 01:18:38.931
What are you talking about?

01:18:39.018 --> 01:18:40.716
When I got back to New York,

01:18:40.803 --> 01:18:43.501
I ran into a friend of mine
who runs an investment firm.

01:18:43.588 --> 01:18:46.417
And the funny thing
about investment firms

01:18:46.504 --> 01:18:50.116
is that they like
to invest in things.

01:18:50.203 --> 01:18:52.336
A hint?

01:18:52.423 --> 01:18:56.427
I told her all about
this wonderful place,

01:18:56.514 --> 01:18:57.820
full of wonderful people

01:18:57.907 --> 01:19:00.083
who try to put
the wonder of Christmas

01:19:00.170 --> 01:19:03.564
into everything
that they do, and...

01:19:03.651 --> 01:19:08.787
like me, she fell in love.

01:19:08.874 --> 01:19:11.007
And she was so taken
by all of this

01:19:11.094 --> 01:19:14.793
that she has decided
to invest fully

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:17.274
in next year'’s
OutWear classic line.

01:19:17.361 --> 01:19:19.363
- You mean...
- Yep.

01:19:19.450 --> 01:19:22.192
OutWear is officially
open for business.

01:19:22.279 --> 01:19:25.369
[Cheers and applause]

01:19:28.981 --> 01:19:31.157
Way to go.

01:19:31.244 --> 01:19:33.769
What about you?
What about your boss?

01:19:33.856 --> 01:19:35.640
What does he think
about all this?

01:19:35.727 --> 01:19:37.729
Why don'’t you ask him
yourself?

01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:44.692
Merry Christmas, everybody!

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:46.129
ALL: Merry Christmas,
Mr. Bullock!

01:19:46.216 --> 01:19:49.132
- Nick, Wyatt.
- Mr. Bullock.

01:19:49.219 --> 01:19:50.916
I don'’t know how
you did it, Riley,

01:19:51.003 --> 01:19:52.396
but you managed
to go around me

01:19:52.483 --> 01:19:55.138
and save OutWear
from the scrapheap...

01:19:55.225 --> 01:19:57.444
for now.

01:19:58.924 --> 01:20:00.926
Thanks to Dana.

01:20:01.013 --> 01:20:02.319
MR. BULLOCK:
Thanks to both of you.

01:20:02.406 --> 01:20:05.235
I have no choice
but to allow the company

01:20:05.322 --> 01:20:07.890
to remain in business
for the next year.

01:20:07.977 --> 01:20:09.413
Thank you, sir.

01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:11.241
That being said,

01:20:11.328 --> 01:20:13.852
there'’s still the matter
of your job.

01:20:13.939 --> 01:20:17.029
You blew it, Thomas.
You directly disobeyed me,

01:20:17.116 --> 01:20:21.164
and I can'’t have any
free-thinkers working for me.

01:20:21.251 --> 01:20:23.819
It'’s unthinkable.
[Chuckles]

01:20:23.906 --> 01:20:26.256
I wouldn'’t have it
any other way, sir.

01:20:26.343 --> 01:20:29.041
That being said,

01:20:29.128 --> 01:20:31.348
Wyatt, don'’t be a fool.

01:20:31.435 --> 01:20:33.785
You'’ve got quite a girl there.

01:20:33.872 --> 01:20:35.656
I wouldn'’t let her get away
if I were you.

01:20:35.743 --> 01:20:39.704
I think maybe we have room
for one more apprentice.

01:20:39.791 --> 01:20:43.490
[Laughter]

01:20:43.577 --> 01:20:45.318
MR. BULLOCK: Good luck, Riley.
I sure hope they know

01:20:45.405 --> 01:20:47.843
what they'’ve
gotten themselves into.

01:20:47.930 --> 01:20:49.757
Somebody bring me a drink!

01:20:52.978 --> 01:20:55.589
Here you are, Mr. Bullock.

01:20:55.676 --> 01:20:57.504
I thought it would be
a milkshake.

01:20:57.591 --> 01:21:00.333
Oh, okay, what kind?

01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:03.206
Tan, you idiot!

01:21:03.293 --> 01:21:05.686
- Tan, tan milkshake
- Tan, it is.

01:21:05.773 --> 01:21:09.342
You know, a little of this,
a little of that. Tan.

01:21:19.657 --> 01:21:20.963
There you are.

01:21:30.276 --> 01:21:34.324
I just...
was taking everything in.

01:21:34.411 --> 01:21:36.892
There was a moment
when I thought

01:21:36.979 --> 01:21:40.417
I might never
see this place again.

01:21:43.333 --> 01:21:46.684
So you plan on staying?

01:21:48.599 --> 01:21:50.035
I'’m thinking about it.

01:21:50.122 --> 01:21:52.646
Something holding you back?

01:21:55.475 --> 01:21:57.347
Maybe.

01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:05.398
There'’s just one tiny little
piece of the puzzle missing.

01:22:05.485 --> 01:22:07.923
Which one?

01:22:10.708 --> 01:22:12.753
You.

01:22:14.581 --> 01:22:16.496
Me?

01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:19.499
Yeah.

01:22:21.937 --> 01:22:23.373
I read somewhere recently

01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:28.421
that it only takes three seconds
to fall in love,

01:22:28.508 --> 01:22:30.293
and the rest is denial.

01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:35.472
And?

01:22:35.559 --> 01:22:38.344
I don'’t want to live my life
in denial anymore.

01:22:41.347 --> 01:22:43.262
Merry Christmas, Wyatt.

01:22:47.875 --> 01:22:50.748
[Applause]

01:22:58.756 --> 01:23:03.065
[cheering]

01:23:07.547 --> 01:23:10.550
[dog barking]

01:23:17.775 --> 01:23:19.733
[dog barks]

01:23:33.138 --> 01:23:35.140
I love it when a plan
comes together.

01:23:39.362 --> 01:23:41.146
Hey, Gloria,
any mail come in for me?

01:23:41.233 --> 01:23:44.236
- Yes, yes, here you go.
- Thanks.

01:23:44.323 --> 01:23:45.933
Oh, and there'’s
a package for you.

01:23:46.021 --> 01:23:47.935
- A package?
- A present.

01:23:48.023 --> 01:23:49.589
- For me?
- From Mr. Bullock.

01:23:49.676 --> 01:23:53.071
Mr. Bullock got me a present!
Wha--

01:23:53.158 --> 01:23:55.117
"Cyril." Wow.

01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:01.253
"Dear Cyril.

01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:02.950
Thank you
for all your hard work.

01:24:03.038 --> 01:24:04.387
Here'’s a special something

01:24:04.474 --> 01:24:05.779
I know you'’ll get
a lot of use out of

01:24:05.866 --> 01:24:07.259
in the years to come.

01:24:07.346 --> 01:24:10.349
Your boss and friend,
Preston Bullock."

01:24:10.436 --> 01:24:13.700
Wow. Mr. Bullock,
you shouldn'’t have.

01:24:18.444 --> 01:24:20.359
Mr. Bullock,
you shouldn'’t have.

01:24:22.187 --> 01:24:23.319
"Tan."

01:24:26.148 --> 01:24:28.541
Merry Christmas, Mr. Bullock.

01:24:28.628 --> 01:24:31.066
Nicest guy
I'’ve ever worked with.

01:24:32.806 --> 01:24:35.070
