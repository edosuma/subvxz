00:01.220 --> 00:02.753
This started as
an anonymous tip,

00:02.754 --> 00:03.921
but it's turned out to be

00:03.988 --> 00:05.756
a crash course
in money laundering.

00:05.824 --> 00:07.558
All right. What's
the front company?

00:07.625 --> 00:09.308
Honey Factory in South Africa.

00:09.376 --> 00:11.743
Let me guess, Honey's real,

00:11.811 --> 00:13.974
some of the orders are fake.
Bing!

00:14.041 --> 00:16.341
Invoices show the factory
sold an order

00:16.409 --> 00:21.551
to a confectionary at 134
Rue du Lombard in Brussels.

00:21.618 --> 00:23.858
- Except it doesn't exist.
- Trip to Brussels

00:23.925 --> 00:25.595

moves fast.

Isaak Von Hagen, go-to guy
for tax evaders the world over.

00:42.466 --> 00:44.737
Yeah, now he's rumored to be
moving money for terrorists.

00:44.805 --> 00:48.207
So how do we get to a guy
with that many layers?

00:48.275 --> 00:49.442
We don't.

00:49.510 --> 00:52.278
We get to his wife.

00:52.346 --> 00:53.813
You think she's the way in?

00:53.881 --> 00:56.449

00:56.516 --> 00:57.983

of marriage.

You think she's looking
for a change?

for a hat.

going to Berlin.

Is this woman Elsa Von Hagen

02:47.677 --> 02:49.078
who I think she is?
A former asset.

02:49.146 --> 02:52.383
Yeah, she went by the name
Petra then, but it's her.

02:52.450 --> 02:53.684
You said she was trouble.

02:53.752 --> 02:55.353
Unreliable maybe.

02:55.421 --> 02:57.322
Dangerous is
the word you used.

02:58.858 --> 03:00.292
Why was she so dangerous?

03:00.360 --> 03:02.261
Oh, it was Berlin in '89.

And I was a punk kid

03:10.670 --> 03:12.271
Have you looped in
German intelligence?

03:12.339 --> 03:13.973
No. Isaak Von Hagen has moles

03:14.040 --> 03:15.374
all over the BND.
Arthur,

03:15.442 --> 03:16.809
you're a public figure.

03:16.877 --> 03:18.744
You can't go skulking
around Berlin

03:18.812 --> 03:20.813
and expect the BND
not to notice.

03:20.880 --> 03:23.416
It's not about
not being noticed.

03:23.484 --> 03:25.018
It's about not being caught.

03:25.085 --> 03:27.153
Karl Schmidt's one of the
good guys. He'll want to help.

03:27.221 --> 03:29.056
Isaak is ultimately
his problem anyway.

03:29.124 --> 03:30.858
Karl could be the mole.

03:30.926 --> 03:33.861
Well, have you at least
given thought

03:33.929 --> 03:36.498
as to who'll cover your desk?
Yes. You.

03:36.566 --> 03:40.636

Being spotted with Arthur,
an overt C.I.A. officer,

04:10.669 --> 04:12.136

strict protocols.

I mean, how does a woman

a long term asset of Arthur's

04:38.495 --> 04:41.697

05:06.825 --> 05:08.258
Arthur's going
to be in and out.

to make introductions.

05:25.810 --> 05:27.844
I may be way off base on this,

05:27.912 --> 05:30.981
but I think Joan wants me
to spy on Arthur.

05:31.049 --> 05:33.917
What kind of intel
is she looking for?

05:33.985 --> 05:36.019
I don't know, but Arthur
has way more experience

05:36.087 --> 05:38.088
as an operative,
he already knows Elsa.

05:38.156 --> 05:40.257
So why am I the one
running point on this?

05:40.325 --> 05:43.160
Well, it could be because
you got us onto Isaak.

05:43.228 --> 05:45.663
Could be because
you're covert and he isn't.

05:45.731 --> 05:47.131

to do with this woman Elsa.

13:15.637 --> 13:18.539
A man in my position might need
some place to stash the money.

13:18.606 --> 13:21.675
Well, if he suspects anything,
he'll kill us both.

13:21.743 --> 13:24.946
Then you'd better
be convincing.

13:26.581 --> 13:29.818
I look forward
to meeting your husband.

13:39.229 --> 13:40.029
Does Langley know
about this plan?

13:40.096 --> 13:42.364
You mean Joan.

13:42.432 --> 13:44.866
Joan appreciates
resourcefulness.

13:44.933 --> 13:48.369
All that matters is whether
or not the job gets done.

13:48.437 --> 13:50.437
And it will.

13:56.097 --> 13:57.364
The meeting must happen today.

13:57.432 --> 14:01.501
- Today?
- In a couple of hours.

14:01.569 --> 14:05.938
Tell Arthur he can't accept
the terms Isaak will give him.

14:06.006 --> 14:09.108
Isaak will know it's a set-up.
- I'll tell him.

14:09.176 --> 14:12.011
Arthur is crazy
to be doing this.

14:12.078 --> 14:13.145
You must know that.

14:13.213 --> 14:15.413
He's good at what he does.

14:15.481 --> 14:18.349
Arthur was going to rise
quickly in the C.I.A.

14:18.417 --> 14:22.921
Berlin proved it.
I set him on that path.

14:22.989 --> 14:24.923
Maybe he's trying
to get us all killed.

14:24.991 --> 14:26.825
Or maybe it's only me.

14:26.893 --> 14:30.463
Why would he want that?

14:30.530 --> 14:32.298
You give Arthur the message.

14:32.366 --> 14:34.267
He must be prompt.

14:34.335 --> 14:35.235
Good luck to us all.

atypical, I know.

15:05.665 --> 15:08.034

It's nice of you to come.

16:03.724 --> 16:06.693
Yeah. I'd also love
for you to yell

16:06.761 --> 16:10.831
if you see Chloe's paintings
anywhere in this pile.

16:10.899 --> 16:12.800
The ones she did
for the art show?

16:12.868 --> 16:14.302
Yeah. I thought
I put them away

16:14.369 --> 16:16.104
for safe-keeping
a few weeks ago, but...

16:16.171 --> 16:17.906
Oh, no.

16:17.973 --> 16:20.641
What?

16:20.709 --> 16:22.309
I got them framed.

16:22.377 --> 16:24.311
Oh, how sweet.

16:24.379 --> 16:25.846
Yeah, but they're
in my apartment.

16:25.913 --> 16:28.314
- Well, I'll go get them.
- You can't.

16:28.382 --> 16:29.949
No one can know where it is.

16:30.017 --> 16:31.750
I can't know where you live?

16:31.818 --> 16:36.355
Not this particular apartment.
The Agency has strict protocols.

16:36.423 --> 16:37.523

I must say, rarely does a
C.I.A. man come to me for help.

17:07.490 --> 17:08.823
Well, there comes
a time when a man

17:08.891 --> 17:11.025
must prepare an exit strategy.

17:11.093 --> 17:12.992
For me that time
appears to be now.

17:13.060 --> 17:17.464
Only a man with special talent
can keep his true nature hidden.

17:17.531 --> 17:19.732
If what my wife says is true,

17:19.800 --> 17:21.568
you have kept yours
hidden a long time.

17:21.636 --> 17:23.002
I'll take that
as a compliment.

17:23.069 --> 17:27.373
You may be using that
special talent on me right now.

Perhaps the C.I.A. made a deal
with the <i>polizei.</i>

17:30.744 --> 17:33.345
If so, the C.I.A. would not
choose to send me.

17:33.413 --> 17:36.247
Because you're overt?

17:36.315 --> 17:40.953

doesn't trust me anymore.

You worked with my wife

is powerful.

of you are plotting against me.

- I prefer my wife to answer.

are a little steep.

About three million,

from another mission.

19:48.315 --> 19:49.582
Okay. Maybe--

maybe I should be
the one to call Joan.

19:50.851 --> 19:53.852
We have a better shot
if I do it.

19:53.920 --> 19:55.821
Yeah, but you're supposed
to be on a plane home already,

19:55.888 --> 19:58.089

blown one check-in.

19:58.157 --> 20:00.025
Well, maybe you're right.

20:00.092 --> 20:04.095
Okay. Um, then, I'm going
to need to be read in.

20:04.163 --> 20:06.765
You've already been read in.

20:06.833 --> 20:08.433
Not on you and Elsa.

of intel, lines blur.

20:16.910 --> 20:19.211
The lines blurred
between you and Elsa?

20:19.279 --> 20:21.447
You feel the need to be honest
with Joan. That's admirable.

20:21.515 --> 20:23.783
But I'm her husband,
and I will explain it all later.

20:23.850 --> 20:24.784
It's better that way.

20:24.851 --> 20:28.188

I graduated, came home
to Richmond, got a decent job.

20:51.613 --> 20:53.846
Where are you being placed?

20:53.914 --> 20:56.549

20:56.616 --> 20:58.350
I always wanted to go,
though, so...

20:58.418 --> 20:59.451
It's about time I did, you know?

20:59.519 --> 21:02.421
- Yeah.
- I forgot to ask

21:02.488 --> 21:03.755
what you brought
for the scrapbook.

21:07.059 --> 21:09.795
Actually, I'm empty-handed.

21:09.863 --> 21:11.764
I wasn't sure I was
coming to this.

21:11.831 --> 21:13.566
Ah.

21:13.634 --> 21:15.468
Well, you can still
contribute something.

21:15.535 --> 21:18.638
It probably won't be as cool
as the original sheet music

21:18.705 --> 21:20.473

that I found,

21:20.541 --> 21:23.309
but you can try.
Not <i>A World Apart?</i>

21:23.376 --> 21:25.010
Yeah, that's the one.

21:25.078 --> 21:27.580
Is it signed?

21:27.647 --> 21:30.149

to find already, come on.

21:30.217 --> 21:34.119

three million cleared that fast.

from another op.

21:41.795 --> 21:45.064
Well, Jai is
in charge of that now,

21:45.131 --> 21:46.165

any of that money

21:46.233 --> 21:48.134

21:48.201 --> 21:49.468

is supposed to be

21:50.570 --> 21:52.672
on a plane to Dulles right now.

21:52.740 --> 21:54.107
If we can get the money
into an account,

21:54.175 --> 21:55.509
we can get the bank codes,

21:55.576 --> 21:57.544
and then both of us
can be home soon after that.

22:08.623 --> 22:10.924
All right.

22:10.992 --> 22:14.794
I'll speak to Jai.
But this better work.

22:23.938 --> 22:28.476
I never expected the guy
that composed <i>A World Apart</i>

22:28.544 --> 22:32.080
to look so professorial.

to ask him

22:38.289 --> 22:40.556

Well, we're here.

of his latest recording too.

with you this fall.

22:45.562 --> 22:48.063
It's better if you don't.

22:48.131 --> 22:50.332
I got good at using
what happened

22:50.400 --> 22:54.635
as an excuse not
to get on with things.

into old habits, you know?

till the end of the set, right?

a blind man to the dance floor.

You love the music.
So show it.

23:21.599 --> 23:26.169
Wrong. Jazz is about feeling.

pretty good.

Arthur was in love with her.

23:46.757 --> 23:49.692

23:49.759 --> 23:51.994
No. We need her
to make the money transfer.

23:52.062 --> 23:54.230
I was afraid that if I told her
about Arthur and Elsa,

23:54.297 --> 23:55.798
she wouldn't do it.

23:55.866 --> 23:58.467
Why are you still up?
It's a school night.

Oh, well, to quote
the famous Annie Walker,

24:15.453 --> 24:17.788
that information
is need to know.

24:39.275 --> 24:40.876
Hey, it's me.

24:40.944 --> 24:43.713
Hey. Annie said you came
through with the money.

24:43.780 --> 24:46.950
- But you're the client, right?
- How'd you know?

24:47.017 --> 24:49.186

24:49.254 --> 24:51.021
And I'm a spy.

And given the fact

24:52.457 --> 24:54.025
that I had to horse-trade
with Jai for the money,

24:54.093 --> 24:57.963
how 'bout you tell me the truth
about you and Elsa?

24:58.031 --> 25:00.766
Oh, I was green.

25:00.834 --> 25:02.468
You were in love with her.

25:08.175 --> 25:10.643
Well, I wasn't ready
to admit it to anyone.

25:10.710 --> 25:14.479
Not even myself.

25:14.547 --> 25:17.949
So two days ago when
she called, you came running?

25:18.017 --> 25:22.587
I know how it must look.

25:22.655 --> 25:24.823
But there is nothing going on
with me and Elsa.

25:24.891 --> 25:26.926
Please know that.

25:26.994 --> 25:29.295
You know what's
in two days from now?

25:29.363 --> 25:32.632
Our wedding anniversary.
I'll be home by then.

25:32.700 --> 25:35.770
You know, we haven't been
in the same city

25:35.837 --> 25:37.538
on our anniversary
in three years.

25:37.606 --> 25:39.640
Last year, I was in Prague.

25:39.708 --> 25:42.243
Well, this year,
we'll start a new trend.

25:42.311 --> 25:43.644
Where do you want to go?

25:43.712 --> 25:48.783
I don't want to go anywhere.
I just want to be home.

25:48.851 --> 25:51.285
With you.

25:51.353 --> 25:55.156
Good night, Arthur.

25:55.224 --> 25:56.625
Oh, good night, Joan.

26:00.529 --> 26:01.362
[Knocking]

26:04.566 --> 26:07.101
[Knocking]

26:15.415 --> 26:17.649
What the hell are you doing?

26:21.820 --> 26:23.387
You know you can't be here.

26:23.455 --> 26:25.389
Isaak is on to you. To us.

26:25.457 --> 26:27.291
I overheard him talking
on the phone.

26:27.359 --> 26:28.826
Somebody tipped him off.

26:28.894 --> 26:29.827
Don't play games
with me, Elsa.

26:29.895 --> 26:31.896
Arthur, this is not a game.

26:31.963 --> 26:35.566
Either we go now, or we hide out
somewhere till dark.

26:35.633 --> 26:36.967
Like we did in 1989?

26:37.035 --> 26:40.337
Our place is still there.

26:40.405 --> 26:41.805
You got the money, didn't you?

26:41.873 --> 26:45.208
That's what this
is all about. The money.

26:45.275 --> 26:48.110
You used to trust me.

26:48.178 --> 26:49.845
Well, I chalk that
up to immaturity.

26:49.913 --> 26:52.081
You were mature enough
to make me envision

26:52.149 --> 26:55.317
a life beyond the wall,
a life with you.

26:55.385 --> 26:58.787
You never intended
to go anywhere.

26:58.855 --> 27:05.794
As operatives go,
you had great instincts.

27:05.861 --> 27:10.699
Probably the best
of any operative I'd seen.

27:10.766 --> 27:15.337
You really think you could've
been so wrong about me?

27:33.958 --> 27:37.995
[Phone ringing]

27:38.062 --> 27:40.331
Hello?

27:40.399 --> 27:41.799
Elsa showed up
at the hotel room

27:41.867 --> 27:43.734
claiming the operation's
been compromised,

27:43.802 --> 27:45.168
that Isaak is on to us.

27:45.236 --> 27:46.336
You don't believe her?

27:46.404 --> 27:48.004
She's trying to play us.

27:48.072 --> 27:49.639
So what do you want to do?

27:49.707 --> 27:51.341
Meet me at the usual spot
in ten minutes.

27:51.409 --> 27:54.444
I'll try
and figure something out.

28:03.286 --> 28:05.087
Coming with me.

28:07.057 --> 28:09.759
What's going on?

28:09.826 --> 28:11.227
Annie, meet Karl Schmidt,

28:11.295 --> 28:12.528
my German counterpart
at the BND.

28:13.898 --> 28:15.966
Karl and I have spoken
many times on the phone,

28:16.034 --> 28:18.235
but never in person until now.

28:18.303 --> 28:19.837
He's been shadowing us.

28:19.905 --> 28:21.606
Saw him at
the curry wurst stand.

28:21.673 --> 28:23.775
Did Elsa Von Hagen
order you to pick us up?

28:23.843 --> 28:25.710
I don't take orders
from the Von Hagens, Arthur.

28:25.778 --> 28:27.979
I'm one of
the good guys, remember?

28:28.046 --> 28:30.148
Well, it's hard to tell,
the way you snatched us up.

28:30.216 --> 28:32.817
I think you'd be
more appreciative.

28:32.885 --> 28:35.353
I'm getting you out of Berlin,
keeping you alive.

28:35.421 --> 28:38.289
Oh. Is that what you're doing?

28:38.357 --> 28:41.025
Been surveilling the Von
Hagens long before you got here.

28:41.093 --> 28:43.728
This morning, we hear chatter
that Isaak wants you dead.

28:43.796 --> 28:46.632
He would take great pleasure
in taking you down,

28:46.700 --> 28:48.500
smearing your reputation,

28:48.568 --> 28:51.503
and that of the C.I.A.
in the process.

29:06.721 --> 29:09.723
Your plane to D.C.

29:09.790 --> 29:12.592
The local <i>polizei</i> will ensure
that you are on it

29:12.660 --> 29:14.060
when it departs.

29:17.831 --> 29:20.065
Safe travels to you both, then.

29:23.402 --> 29:28.606
Oh, and, uh...nice jacket.
Very German.

29:31.176 --> 29:33.777
Arthur.

29:33.845 --> 29:34.778
What about Elsa?

29:34.846 --> 29:37.414
What about her?

29:37.482 --> 29:38.782
We're just going
to leave her here?

29:38.850 --> 29:40.784
You heard what Karl said,
she vouched for us.

29:40.852 --> 29:42.019
There's a lot
about Elsa you don't know.

29:42.086 --> 29:43.153
Okay.

29:43.221 --> 29:45.355
Read me in.

29:45.422 --> 29:47.257
She was playing a game
back in '89.

29:47.324 --> 29:48.725
One I barely got out of.

29:48.792 --> 29:50.660
We were supposed to meet
at one of the train stations

29:50.727 --> 29:52.061
that the secret police
had closed down

29:52.129 --> 29:53.162
after the Berlin Wall was built.

29:53.229 --> 29:54.396
Ghost station.

29:54.464 --> 29:55.831
She was going to defect.

29:55.898 --> 29:59.100
I get there.
Elsa's nowhere to be found.

29:59.168 --> 30:02.503
But the Stasi's there,
with guns.

30:05.441 --> 30:06.841
I know you're my boss.

30:06.909 --> 30:10.779
You're actually my boss's boss,
which is worse.

30:10.847 --> 30:12.648
But if you thought
Elsa betrayed you,

30:12.716 --> 30:14.951
why'd you come to Berlin?

30:15.018 --> 30:16.786
Why'd you take that call?

30:16.854 --> 30:19.356
If you're absolutely certain
she betrayed you,

30:19.423 --> 30:21.925
then we should get on
that plane right now, but...

30:21.993 --> 30:23.961
If there's any doubt--

30:24.028 --> 30:27.631
I do have doubts.

30:27.699 --> 30:29.833
But it's too late.

30:29.901 --> 30:34.304
No, if there's a chance
to save her, we should take it.

30:34.372 --> 30:37.807
I know how difficult it can be.

30:37.875 --> 30:39.809
Trusting someone
when it seems dangerous.

30:39.876 --> 30:44.446
We'd have to get by
these guys first.

30:44.514 --> 30:47.483
Yeah.

30:47.551 --> 30:50.387
How?

30:50.455 --> 30:52.957
I got 13 operatives
out of here during the Cold War,

30:53.024 --> 30:55.693
I can get us back in now.

31:21.566 --> 31:23.767
How did you know
the <i>polizei</i> would help us?

31:23.813 --> 31:26.281
Well, the <i>polizei</i> hate the way
the BND come in barking orders.

31:26.349 --> 31:27.683
Kind of like the police
and F.B.I.

31:27.751 --> 31:29.218
Some things are universal.

31:29.286 --> 31:33.956
A man in uniform's distaste
for a suit, that's one.

31:34.024 --> 31:36.793
The ghost station's down here.

31:39.697 --> 31:42.264
Wait here. It could
be dangerous.

31:42.332 --> 31:44.399
- It's okay. I'll come.
- Stay here.

31:44.467 --> 31:45.467
Keep your eyes open.

31:57.280 --> 31:58.980
Arthur?

32:05.622 --> 32:06.988
You must go. Now.

32:07.056 --> 32:09.324
Isaak, he knows I was
working with you.

32:09.391 --> 32:11.926
I think one of his men
followed me here.

32:11.994 --> 32:15.297
I did my best to shake him,
but I can't be sure.

32:15.365 --> 32:18.066
We've got a van outside.

32:18.134 --> 32:20.403
We move quickly, we got
a shot at escaping.

32:20.470 --> 32:22.638
Arthur, thank you.

32:22.706 --> 32:25.575
You don't have
to thank me. Let's go.

32:30.481 --> 32:33.617
- He's still not back, Miles.
- Sorry.

32:33.684 --> 32:35.518
Let me save you another trip.

32:35.586 --> 32:37.821
Arthur will trade you
Deshawn Jackson

32:37.888 --> 32:39.656
for Eli Manning and your
first pick in the keeper draft.

32:39.724 --> 32:41.658
What?

32:41.725 --> 32:42.992
That's breakaway speed,
and I'm sure Manning

32:43.060 --> 32:44.260
isn't thrilled
to be warming your bench.

32:44.328 --> 32:48.330
Yeah.

32:50.466 --> 32:51.733
Auggie.

32:51.801 --> 32:53.234
Have you heard from Arthur
or Annie?

32:53.302 --> 32:54.935
No, why?

32:55.003 --> 32:57.071
Because they still haven't
picked up the money,

32:57.139 --> 33:00.342
and neither of them
are answering their phones.

33:00.410 --> 33:02.678
I'll see what I can find out.

33:13.492 --> 33:14.992
That's him.
One of Isaak's men.

33:16.795 --> 33:18.929
This way. My car's hidden
not far from here.

33:26.171 --> 33:28.505
Halt!

33:51.265 --> 33:53.800
Go, go.

33:53.868 --> 33:54.868

35:14.180 --> 35:16.615

a few moves of our own.

35:44.045 --> 35:44.945
[Gunshot]

35:50.485 --> 35:51.751
Don't worry,
I got this.

[Tires screech]

36:11.287 --> 36:13.755
[Tires screech]

36:48.351 --> 36:49.740
Your flight to London.

36:49.741 --> 36:51.609
Interpol has Isaak
in custody already,

36:51.677 --> 36:53.544
so you'll be safe.

36:53.612 --> 36:55.679
Our mission succeeded.

36:55.747 --> 36:57.881
They have a team
pulling valuable intel

36:57.949 --> 37:00.050
from Isaak's network
as we speak.

37:00.118 --> 37:01.751
Funny...

37:01.819 --> 37:04.053
I thought the only way
I'd ever leave Berlin

37:04.121 --> 37:05.788
was with you.

37:07.924 --> 37:10.759
I was detained
that last night.

37:10.827 --> 37:14.062
Somebody had tipped
the police off about us,

37:14.129 --> 37:15.997
about what we were planning.

37:16.065 --> 37:18.967
I told no one.

37:19.035 --> 37:21.570
You believe me now,
don't you?

37:25.241 --> 37:27.743
It doesn't matter.

37:27.811 --> 37:31.981
You'll go to England,
I'll go home to D.C.

37:32.049 --> 37:33.582
To your wife.

37:35.052 --> 37:37.987
Good-bye, Arthur.

37:40.623 --> 37:41.590
Good-bye, Elsa.

38:00.810 --> 38:02.710
It's not the ending
of the Cold War,

38:02.778 --> 38:04.179
but it's a job well done.

38:04.246 --> 38:08.116
Oh...I got a hero's welcome
when the wall fell.

38:08.184 --> 38:10.552
One that I did not deserve.

38:10.619 --> 38:13.355
I just happened to be
in Berlin at the right time.

38:13.422 --> 38:16.157
The kudos you'll receive
for this work you've done here

38:16.225 --> 38:17.592
will be well earned.

38:17.660 --> 38:20.595
I can hardly take
the credit.

38:20.663 --> 38:24.132
Oh, you'll have to.

38:24.200 --> 38:27.202
I was never here.

38:27.269 --> 38:29.070
[Plane engine revs]

38:33.975 --> 38:35.910
Hey.

38:35.978 --> 38:38.179
I'm sorry to show up
like this.

38:38.247 --> 38:40.081
- No, it's okay.
- [Chuckles]

38:40.149 --> 38:41.416
Is everything all right?
Come on in.

38:41.484 --> 38:44.686
Um, it would have made
more sense to call,

38:44.754 --> 38:48.657
but I thought I should
say this in person.

38:48.725 --> 38:52.261
And I need to say it now
or I might lose my nerve.

38:52.329 --> 38:54.530
Okay.

38:54.598 --> 38:56.332
I really appreciate
your offering

38:56.400 --> 38:58.100
to hang out this weekend,

38:58.168 --> 38:59.469
but I don't know.

38:59.536 --> 39:00.970
You don't think
it's such a good idea.

39:01.038 --> 39:03.005
Yeah.

39:03.072 --> 39:04.906
I mean, it just took so long
to get over losing Billy,

39:04.974 --> 39:07.609
and this feels like--
- No, no. You know what...

39:07.677 --> 39:09.244
Hey, you don't need
to explain it.

39:09.312 --> 39:11.747
Certainly not to me.

39:11.814 --> 39:16.017
Okay.

39:16.085 --> 39:20.054
Well, I...
Guess I should go then.

39:26.728 --> 39:29.330
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done that.

39:35.370 --> 39:36.670
I thought we were
on the same page.

39:36.738 --> 39:40.307
- You said this was a bad idea.
- Mm-hmm. Right.

39:40.375 --> 39:42.276
- So we agree.
- Mm-hmm.

39:54.823 --> 39:58.158
No romantic dinner.

39:58.226 --> 40:01.095
I assumed I'd be
eating alone.

40:01.162 --> 40:02.696
I'm sorry.

40:08.637 --> 40:10.571
You had me worried.

40:10.639 --> 40:12.273
You didn't need to be.

40:12.341 --> 40:14.108
You should have told me.

40:14.176 --> 40:17.077
You're right.

40:17.145 --> 40:21.114
But Berlin is behind me.

40:21.182 --> 40:24.484
For us Navy boys...

40:26.688 --> 40:28.988
This symbolizes
safe passage home.

40:32.059 --> 40:36.095
It's beautiful.

40:36.162 --> 40:39.131
I got you something too.

40:49.009 --> 40:50.710
- Eli Manning?
- Mm-hmm.

40:50.777 --> 40:52.879
Thanks to me,
you're winning now.

40:52.947 --> 40:55.215
Happy anniversary.

41:03.592 --> 41:05.326
Happy anniversary.

41:16.173 --> 41:17.640

41:19.710 --> 41:21.477
Chocolate chip pancakes.

41:21.545 --> 41:23.913
Chloe's favorite.
I made them myself.

41:23.981 --> 41:26.449
Well, the girls
aren't up yet.

41:28.819 --> 41:30.019
I know this won't
make up

41:30.087 --> 41:31.086
for what happened
with Chloe's artwork.

41:34.557 --> 41:36.025
I realize we don't
always get the chance

41:36.092 --> 41:37.626
to make things right.

41:37.694 --> 41:40.763
Sometimes what's done

41:54.445 --> 41:57.480
Well, the girls will be up
any minute.

41:57.548 --> 42:00.083
