<i>Previously on fucking "Chucky"...</i>

00:03.829 --> 00:05.048
Hey! Come back here!

00:05.048 --> 00:06.093
Come back here!

00:07.703 --> 00:10.053
He said he was my friend
till the end,

00:10.053 --> 00:11.141
<i>but he lied.</i>

00:11.141 --> 00:13.317
She is incredibly rare.

00:13.317 --> 00:15.624
I need
to transfer my soul again,

00:15.624 --> 00:18.366
but I can only transfer it
into a Belle doll.

00:18.366 --> 00:20.063
Dolls are horrifying.

00:20.063 --> 00:21.195
Never trust any doll.

00:21.195 --> 00:22.935
Dolls are fucked up.

00:22.935 --> 00:25.199
<i>You were never there for us,
and you still aren't.</i>

00:25.199 --> 00:28.158
<i>Whatever you do,
you are my kid,</i>

00:28.158 --> 00:29.507
<i>you are a killer,</i>

00:29.507 --> 00:32.075
<i>and you can't escape that!</i>

00:32.075 --> 00:33.903
Good Guy dolls are hard
to come by.

00:33.903 --> 00:35.252
In fact,
this is the last one,

00:35.252 --> 00:37.080
and I'm gonna need it
for Chucky Prime.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.212
Do we have a deal?

00:38.212 --> 00:40.257
<i>We did it.</i>

00:40.257 --> 00:42.042
I can't believe it.
we finally got him.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.217
both: No!

00:43.217 --> 00:44.914
Aah!

00:44.914 --> 00:47.569
- Glen!
- No! No!

00:47.569 --> 00:50.267
Every Better Days Hospital
in the country

00:50.267 --> 00:51.964
will receive a priceless gift

00:51.964 --> 00:56.317
from her personal collection
of vintage Good Guy Dolls.

00:56.317 --> 00:57.709
Keep this handy.

00:57.709 --> 00:59.146
Sweet dreams.

01:40.926 --> 01:43.929
Do you think his whole life
is flashing before his eyes?

02:04.863 --> 02:09.868
<i>♪ You were rockin'
and rollin' ♪</i>

02:11.740 --> 02:13.089
<i>Charlie?</i>

02:13.089 --> 02:16.223
<i>Did you always plan
on killing your mother</i>

02:16.223 --> 02:18.747
<i>or was it
a spontaneous decision?</i>

02:18.747 --> 02:20.314
What's spontaneous?

02:20.314 --> 02:21.967
All of a sudden.

02:21.967 --> 02:23.404
Unplanned.

02:23.404 --> 02:25.580
I like both actually,

02:25.580 --> 02:27.973
but spontaneous
is the most fun.

02:32.978 --> 02:36.460
So, Doc, here's the deal.

02:36.460 --> 02:39.637
I need to get one
of these little shits

02:39.637 --> 02:41.422
to kill someone.

02:41.422 --> 02:45.165
Well, I've had them all
on my couch over the years.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.297
I nod. I prod.

02:47.297 --> 02:49.778
They do what I tell them,
and then I just sit back

02:49.778 --> 02:52.041
and watch their lives
fall apart, more or less.

02:53.564 --> 02:55.175
It's quite fascinating really.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.002
But how do I do it?

02:57.002 --> 02:58.134
Most kids aren't born

02:58.134 --> 03:00.092
with my kind of talent,
you know?

03:00.092 --> 03:02.443
Of course not, Charlie.

03:02.443 --> 03:07.230
Your particular form of genius
is exceedingly rare.

03:07.230 --> 03:10.190
Keep in mind,
these are teenagers.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.192
They are ruled
by their hormones,

03:12.192 --> 03:15.064
their emotions,
and their anxieties.

03:16.718 --> 03:18.023
Mom!

03:19.416 --> 03:22.593
If you want
to push them over the edge...

03:22.593 --> 03:23.507
Aah!

03:23.507 --> 03:25.857
Mom?

03:25.857 --> 03:30.122
All you have to do
is traumatize them.

03:30.122 --> 03:33.256
Uh-huh.

03:34.562 --> 03:36.346
Whoa!

03:36.346 --> 03:38.392
Thank you. Finally.

03:38.392 --> 03:41.090
You have no idea
how hard it's been

03:41.090 --> 03:45.486
getting one of you little shits
to step the fuck up and play.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.233
<i>I'll spare her

03:53.233 --> 03:55.060
<i>and our lord and savior.</i>

03:55.060 --> 03:56.453
So long, suckers.

03:56.453 --> 03:59.108
See ya real soon.

04:06.115 --> 04:08.248
Sorry, Doc,

04:08.248 --> 04:11.903
but I'm afraid our time is up.

Aah!

04:20.956 --> 04:24.307
<i>Ade due Damballa.</i>

04:24.307 --> 04:29.007

04:33.795 --> 04:34.796

04:42.804 --> 04:44.109
No.

04:59.386 --> 05:02.389

06:46.928 --> 06:49.496
<i>I know you know my last name.</i>

06:49.496 --> 06:53.413
I've never exactly
been anonymous.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.764
I'm an addict.

06:56.764 --> 06:59.157
Just got out of rehab.

07:01.769 --> 07:05.207
It's one of the very
few things in my life

07:05.207 --> 07:10.212
that I never posted about
on TikTok or Instagram

07:10.212 --> 07:15.609
because it didn't fit
into the perfect commercial

07:15.609 --> 07:19.134
for the perfect life
I was trying to advertise.

07:19.134 --> 07:22.093
Like, layers and layers
of secrets

07:22.093 --> 07:26.576
I've been trying so hard
to keep covered up.

07:26.576 --> 07:28.970
But the truth is,

07:28.970 --> 07:32.539
my addiction isn't the only
secret I've been keeping.

07:34.628 --> 07:36.760
There's another secret,

07:36.760 --> 07:40.634
one that only three other
people in my life know about.

07:42.287 --> 07:44.681
It's definitely one
of the reasons I'm an addict

07:44.681 --> 07:45.813
in the first place.

07:47.902 --> 07:50.687
But it's even scarier
than the addiction itself.

07:52.341 --> 07:54.517
The truth is,

07:54.517 --> 07:57.955
for a while now,

07:57.955 --> 08:01.916
there's been a monster
in my life,

08:01.916 --> 08:07.225
a monster hiding behind
a supposedly innocent face.

08:07.225 --> 08:11.229
It's actually been driving
certain behavior on my part

08:11.229 --> 08:15.669
that may have looked pretty bad
from the outside.

08:20.978 --> 08:23.807
The monster is...

08:27.289 --> 08:28.551
My mother.

08:34.992 --> 08:38.735
I mean, we all know
what she's like, right?

08:38.735 --> 08:43.087
Controlling, self-absorbed, narcissistic.

08:45.350 --> 08:48.179
It's no wonder I'm an addict.

08:48.179 --> 08:51.661
Frankly, with my mother
as a role model,

08:51.661 --> 08:54.272
it's a miracle
I'm not a hooker.

09:01.584 --> 09:04.369
Hey, so have you talked
to Devon?

09:04.369 --> 09:06.197
Maybe once.

09:06.197 --> 09:08.678
You know, rehab and a billion
hours of community service

09:08.678 --> 09:11.028
didn't exactly
help my social life.

09:11.028 --> 09:13.030
He's probably just busy
getting his hours in.

09:13.030 --> 09:14.336
Yeah.
I mean, you're probably right.

09:14.336 --> 09:17.078
I mean, I just finished mine
yesterday, so...

09:18.949 --> 09:21.561
<i>Merry Christmas.
You're under arrest.</i>

09:24.128 --> 09:26.870
<i>So your mom's really okay</i>

09:26.870 --> 09:29.307
with me staying
over the holidays?

09:29.307 --> 09:32.223
- I haven't told her yet.
- Wait, what?

09:34.138 --> 09:35.749
Okay.

09:35.749 --> 09:38.752
Perfect timing.
Let me do the talking.

09:43.365 --> 09:44.584
Hey, Mom.
- Hi.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.194
Jake's here,

09:46.194 --> 09:49.023
and he needs a place to crash
for a few days.

09:49.023 --> 09:51.503
Jake.
Oh, it's so good to see you.

09:51.503 --> 09:52.722
Of course you can stay here.

09:52.722 --> 09:54.681
It's the holidays.

09:54.681 --> 09:56.857
You should be
with people who love you.

09:56.857 --> 09:58.859
Thank you, Mrs. Cross.

09:58.859 --> 10:01.513
- Mm.
- Yeah. Thanks, Mom.

10:01.513 --> 10:05.561
Mrs. Cross is what I call
the mother of my late husband.

10:05.561 --> 10:07.519
God rest his soul.

10:07.519 --> 10:09.260
Please call me Michelle.

10:09.260 --> 10:11.088
Thanks, Michelle.

10:14.135 --> 10:16.964
Besides,
surviving an ordeal together,

10:16.964 --> 10:18.530
like we did
with last year's tragedies,

10:18.530 --> 10:22.709
I think has taught us all
the real meaning of community.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.493
I mean, what kind
of neighbor would I be

10:24.493 --> 10:26.626
if I wasn't here
to take in a...

10:26.626 --> 10:30.194
a poor orphan
during the holidays?

10:30.194 --> 10:33.720
Um, two orphans.

10:35.286 --> 10:36.461
What?

10:36.461 --> 10:37.549
Surprise!

10:37.549 --> 10:39.682
Oh, my God.

10:39.682 --> 10:41.466
Wait, Devon.

10:41.466 --> 10:43.033
Oh, my God.
- Hey.

10:44.731 --> 10:46.515
- Uh...
- So did you miss me?

10:46.515 --> 10:49.474
Uh, yeah,
I missed you.

10:49.474 --> 10:52.303
So what's been going on?

10:52.303 --> 10:54.784
God damn it, Alexandra.
Why do you do this to me?

10:54.784 --> 10:57.482
I was live streaming
to 100,000 followers.

10:57.482 --> 10:58.701
What's the problem?

10:58.701 --> 11:02.139
Wouldn't taking in
two orphans at Christmas

11:02.139 --> 11:06.840
make you look even more
charitable and mayor-like?

11:06.840 --> 11:08.798
Say, normal to your followers?

11:08.798 --> 11:10.713
I can't do this
with you today, okay?

11:10.713 --> 11:12.497
I can't do this.

11:12.497 --> 11:13.760
I'm walking away.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.239
I'm done.

11:16.763 --> 11:17.720
Hi.

11:19.809 --> 11:23.247
Um, Merry Christmas, Jake.

11:23.247 --> 11:24.684
I'm your present.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.511
From me.

11:26.511 --> 11:29.079
And this is from me.

11:29.079 --> 11:31.821
Oh, wow.
Thank you.

11:31.821 --> 11:35.738
Um, I have to go out
for a while.

11:35.738 --> 11:37.479
- You just got here.
- Yeah, I--I know.

11:37.479 --> 11:40.047
Um, I just--
I have to get your present.

11:40.047 --> 11:43.006
- You're my present.
- Yeah, but I'm from Lexy.

11:43.006 --> 11:45.269
You know,
we're both presents from Lexy.

11:45.269 --> 11:47.707
You know,
this is from you to me,

11:47.707 --> 11:49.099
so, you know,
I have to reciprocate.

11:49.099 --> 11:52.015
Jake, you're making this
way too complicated.

11:52.015 --> 11:53.756
I just wanna
spend time with you.

11:53.756 --> 11:55.018
That's all I want
for Christmas.

11:55.018 --> 11:56.324
Look, I know.
Me too.

11:56.324 --> 11:58.587
But you're gonna love this.
I promise, okay?

11:58.587 --> 12:01.242
Look, I'll be right back.

12:01.242 --> 12:02.939
See you in a bit,
and Merry Christmas.

<i>Questions still surround

12:45.808 --> 12:47.679
Not tonight. Thanks.

12:47.679 --> 12:49.116
I'm okay.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.909
Hi. Happy holidays.

13:28.459 --> 13:29.809
I'm back.

13:41.995 --> 13:44.040
Hey.
- How are they?

13:46.651 --> 13:49.089
Not good.

13:49.089 --> 13:52.135
The doctors say
that they have...

13:52.135 --> 13:55.051
days now, maybe less.

13:57.575 --> 14:01.144
I can't lose Glen, Mom.

14:01.144 --> 14:03.712
If they die,
I die too.

14:03.712 --> 14:06.541

14:09.674 --> 14:10.719
Yes.

14:10.719 --> 14:13.287
And you're okay with that?

14:13.287 --> 14:16.246
Why do you think I saved it
all these years?

14:16.246 --> 14:18.205
We have to get you in here.

14:18.205 --> 14:21.208

14:21.208 --> 14:23.863
What--what about the guard?

14:23.863 --> 14:25.516
I have an idea.

14:25.516 --> 14:27.649
You just have to be
Jennifer Tilly one last time.

14:27.649 --> 14:32.001
But Jennifer Tilly's wanted
for murder.

14:32.001 --> 14:35.918
Jennifer Tilly
is a damn good actress.

14:35.918 --> 14:38.007
And tomorrow,

14:38.007 --> 14:43.186

15:09.299 --> 15:12.389
Mm, what the hell?
I deserve it.

15:12.389 --> 15:16.393
I've been a very naughty boy
this year.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.101
Hey, everybody.

15:28.101 --> 15:29.798
I just wanted to pop in

15:29.798 --> 15:35.021
and share how my beautiful
nativity-scape is coming along.

15:35.021 --> 15:37.980
Take a look.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.547
Here we go.

15:39.547 --> 15:44.552
I just finished dressing
these handsome gents.

15:44.552 --> 15:48.991
And can't find
a suitable baby Jesus?

15:48.991 --> 15:51.602
Any doll from your kid's room
will do.

15:57.608 --> 15:59.610
- Hi there. How you doing?
- Hi.

16:08.358 --> 16:09.359
Aah!

16:09.359 --> 16:11.405
- Oh, my God.
- Seriously?

16:11.405 --> 16:12.841
I'm sorry.
I'm such a klutz.

16:12.841 --> 16:15.800
Here, just get another one
on me.

16:20.414 --> 16:22.938
Sorry.

16:22.938 --> 16:24.766
Fucking moron.

16:33.818 --> 16:35.559
Whoa.
Excuse me.

16:38.649 --> 16:40.173
Merry Christmas, Doctor.

16:40.173 --> 16:42.175
Merry Christmas.

16:48.355 --> 16:51.619
Oh.

16:57.190 --> 16:59.931
Oh, my poor baby.

17:06.112 --> 17:08.679
Okay.
We have to be quick.

17:20.082 --> 17:23.042
Okay. All right.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.434
Uh, here.

17:24.434 --> 17:25.740
Okay. Ready?

17:28.177 --> 17:29.744
Holy shit. You.

17:29.744 --> 17:31.354
Yes, it's me,

17:31.354 --> 17:33.356
Dr. Robert Rasmussen.

17:33.356 --> 17:36.142
I didn't think you'd actually
be stupid enough to come here.

17:36.142 --> 17:40.102
Predictability is so boring.
Don't you think?

17:40.102 --> 17:41.799
Hold on right there.

17:41.799 --> 17:44.019
Are you gonna
finish that drink?

17:44.019 --> 17:46.239
I suppose your plan is
to throw it in my face?

17:46.239 --> 17:49.329
Could be.

17:49.329 --> 17:51.113
Ooh, or these flowers.

17:51.113 --> 17:52.767
- Jenn, put it down.
- Aah!

17:55.770 --> 17:58.251
Everything okay in there?

18:01.645 --> 18:02.820
I heard a crash.

18:02.820 --> 18:05.519
Oh, the klutz strikes again.

18:05.519 --> 18:06.868
I--I broke a vase.

18:06.868 --> 18:08.565
Oh, that's okay, hon.

18:08.565 --> 18:09.566
I'll get someone
to clean it up.

18:09.566 --> 18:11.742
No. No, no, no.
I got it.

18:11.742 --> 18:14.832
- You sure?
- Sure as sugar.

18:14.832 --> 18:16.704
Okay, then.

18:37.203 --> 18:40.336
Hey, Mom?

18:40.336 --> 18:42.512
Clear?

18:42.512 --> 18:45.646
Oh, yes.

18:52.566 --> 18:56.265
Aah!

19:06.667 --> 19:09.757
Merry Christmas, Mom.

19:09.757 --> 19:12.194
Merry Christmas, Glenda.

19:39.743 --> 19:44.052
Aah!

19:47.534 --> 19:51.973
<i>I just finished
dressing these handsome gents.</i>

19:51.973 --> 19:56.847
<i>And can't find
a suitable baby Jesus?</i>

19:56.847 --> 19:59.415
<i>Any doll from your kid's room
will do.</i>

19:59.415 --> 20:01.852
- Oh, my God.
<i>- Bye, and Merry Christmas!</i>

20:01.852 --> 20:04.333
What is it?

20:04.333 --> 20:09.077
I think Mummy just found
her next sublet.

20:09.077 --> 20:10.383
Okay.

20:10.383 --> 20:13.081
Let's see.
Where was I?

20:13.081 --> 20:15.431
Am I done yet?
Can I see?

20:15.431 --> 20:17.303
No, no, no, no, no, no.

20:17.303 --> 20:21.307
I just have to put on
the finishing touches.

20:21.307 --> 20:23.265
Oh.

20:23.265 --> 20:26.312
And a little bit
more lip gloss.

20:28.183 --> 20:29.402
All right.

20:29.402 --> 20:32.753
You can look now.

20:32.753 --> 20:36.278
Ta-da.

20:36.278 --> 20:39.673
Oh, it's me.

20:39.673 --> 20:42.328
Oh, I love it.

20:42.328 --> 20:44.417
I love me.

20:44.417 --> 20:46.114
Oh, thank you, Mummy.

20:46.114 --> 20:48.986
Oh, you're welcome, Gl--

20:48.986 --> 20:51.250
Oh, what should I call you now?

20:53.121 --> 20:54.514
G.G.

20:54.514 --> 20:55.776
Call me G.G.

20:55.776 --> 20:57.343
G.G.

20:57.343 --> 20:59.562
I love it.

20:59.562 --> 21:02.086
So, G.G.,
what should we do now?

21:02.086 --> 21:06.047
Should we go online
and shop for little tiny shoes?

21:06.047 --> 21:07.788
Oh, stop it, Mummy!

21:07.788 --> 21:10.486
You'll wrinkle my dress.

21:10.486 --> 21:14.185
Or we could scare the shit out
of that little brat

21:14.185 --> 21:16.318
in room 304
down the hall.

21:16.318 --> 21:20.017
Oh,
actually I thought maybe--

21:20.017 --> 21:22.411
I thought
I might do some traveling.

21:23.978 --> 21:26.067
Oh.

21:26.067 --> 21:28.156
Oh, that would...

21:28.156 --> 21:31.812
That sounds very exciting.

21:31.812 --> 21:34.162
Where do you think
you might wanna go?

21:34.162 --> 21:35.424
England.

21:35.424 --> 21:38.079
England, definitely.

21:38.079 --> 21:40.124
I want to explore my roots.

21:40.124 --> 21:41.474
Oh, yeah.

21:41.474 --> 21:44.128
I'm kind of clocking that.

21:44.128 --> 21:46.740
What's that accent
you're doing?

21:46.740 --> 21:48.959
It's my accent.

21:48.959 --> 21:52.746
Oh, no, Sweetface,
you're way overplaying it.

21:52.746 --> 21:56.967
If I were you, I would
dial it back to about a seven.

21:58.534 --> 22:02.190
What would Jennifer Tilly do, hmm?

22:02.190 --> 22:05.846
Crank that shit.

22:13.419 --> 22:16.160
Oh, I'm going
to miss you, Mummy.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.640
Aw.

22:17.640 --> 22:21.340
I'm going to miss you too, G.G.

22:21.340 --> 22:26.127
Can I give you a lift
to the post office?

22:52.936 --> 22:54.329
Hey, I'm back.

22:54.329 --> 22:56.331
Where have you been?

22:56.331 --> 22:58.072
What's this?

22:58.072 --> 23:00.074
So I know this is
against the rules of Christmas,

23:00.074 --> 23:03.469
but I couldn't wait
till tomorrow, so...

23:11.912 --> 23:13.696
Come on.
Open it.

23:21.704 --> 23:23.967
I did some research online.

23:23.967 --> 23:27.275
Apparently,
this is the best one, so...

23:27.275 --> 23:30.060
I thought maybe it could help
you get back into podcasting,

23:30.060 --> 23:31.671
just like old times.

23:33.760 --> 23:34.717
Thanks.

23:36.850 --> 23:38.895
What?

23:38.895 --> 23:42.638
Well, I haven't really been
into podcasting for a year.

23:42.638 --> 23:44.379
I'm kind of done with it.

23:47.513 --> 23:49.819
Okay.
Um, I'm sorry.

23:51.517 --> 23:54.171
But, I mean,
it is cool, though.

23:54.171 --> 23:55.738
Thanks.

23:57.305 --> 23:58.524
Yeah.

24:03.093 --> 24:05.052
Merry Christmas, Devon.

24:05.052 --> 24:08.882
Yeah, you too.

24:12.625 --> 24:14.670
<i>♪ For the end of December</i>

24:14.670 --> 24:16.977
<i>♪ When the weather's
really chilly ♪</i>

24:16.977 --> 24:19.196
All right.

24:19.196 --> 24:20.894
There we go.

24:22.722 --> 24:24.680
Oh.

24:24.680 --> 24:27.944
I have to post this.

24:31.905 --> 24:34.690
Everybody, smile.

24:34.690 --> 24:36.910
Beautiful.

24:36.910 --> 24:40.435
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

24:42.045 --> 24:46.746
So my followers really seem
to love my nativity scene.

24:46.746 --> 24:50.140
It got over 30,000 likes.

24:50.140 --> 24:53.492
So, sweetheart, are you excited
for Santa tonight?

24:53.492 --> 24:55.668
I guess.

24:55.668 --> 24:57.713
Well, you've been
such a good girl this year.

24:57.713 --> 25:00.020
I bet he's gonna bring you
something really special.

25:00.020 --> 25:01.674
I hope I like it.

25:01.674 --> 25:03.893
No, it's okay
if you don't, though.

25:03.893 --> 25:05.068
You could always
just exchange it

25:05.068 --> 25:06.548
for something
you think is better.

25:06.548 --> 25:07.984
- Jake--
- I mean,

25:07.984 --> 25:09.420
just return it for cash.

25:09.420 --> 25:10.770
I mean,
cash is great.

25:10.770 --> 25:13.250
Jake, I like the gift, okay?

25:13.250 --> 25:15.035
Yeah, well,
it doesn't seem like you do.

25:15.035 --> 25:17.124
What do you want me to say?
I love it.

25:17.124 --> 25:19.039
I think it's the greatest gift
in the history of all gifts.

25:19.039 --> 25:20.562
I was just trying
to make you happy.

25:20.562 --> 25:21.520
What's wrong with that?
- You're not trying

25:21.520 --> 25:22.825
to make me happy.

25:22.825 --> 25:24.044
You're trying
to make yourself feel better.

25:24.044 --> 25:25.741
What is that
supposed to mean?

25:25.741 --> 25:27.874
That podcast shit
is so last year.

25:29.136 --> 25:31.094
Language.

25:31.094 --> 25:32.313
Then what?

25:32.313 --> 25:33.880
What do you want?
- You.

25:33.880 --> 25:36.099
- You have me.
- No, I don't.

25:37.623 --> 25:39.581
You didn't even show up
for Halloween.

25:39.581 --> 25:41.931
And when we were
finally back together,

25:41.931 --> 25:43.933
all you did was ignore
how I felt about...

25:45.282 --> 25:46.588
Stuff.

25:48.329 --> 25:50.157
I came here 'cause I thought
things were gonna be different.

25:52.289 --> 25:53.813
I feel like an idiot.

25:55.641 --> 25:57.599
All this time we've said
we've been together,

25:57.599 --> 26:00.863
but I think you left
a long time ago.

26:06.826 --> 26:09.959
Devon, I--

26:09.959 --> 26:12.309
All right, all right.
Enough, enough.

26:12.309 --> 26:13.702
This is wildly inappropriate.

26:13.702 --> 26:14.964
Mom,
they're just being honest.

26:14.964 --> 26:18.098
The dinner table
is no place for that.

26:18.098 --> 26:20.535
It's Christmas,
for God's sake.

26:23.538 --> 26:25.322
Well, I have something
that I wanna say.

26:25.322 --> 26:27.629
Oh, Lexy,
please, not now.

26:27.629 --> 26:30.589
- Mom, I was just gonna--
- Oh, look, here it goes.

26:33.504 --> 26:35.071
I'm sorry.

26:37.552 --> 26:41.600
All this time,
during my recovery...

26:41.600 --> 26:45.429
I've blamed you for everything
that's gone wrong in my life--

26:45.429 --> 26:49.172
how you've been
selfish and mean

26:49.172 --> 26:52.872
and how you've just left me
alone in all the sadness.

26:52.872 --> 26:55.004
This is your apology?

26:55.004 --> 26:57.790
- Look, Michelle--
- Mrs. Cross.

26:57.790 --> 27:02.142
Mrs. Cross,
this isn't easy for her, okay?

27:02.142 --> 27:03.839
I know you think that Lexy
just cares about herself,

27:03.839 --> 27:06.015
but that's not true.

27:06.015 --> 27:07.669
She's been trying really hard,

27:07.669 --> 27:10.541
and the least you can do
is listen to her.

27:10.541 --> 27:11.934
Okay.

27:13.283 --> 27:15.677
Thanks, Jake.

27:19.420 --> 27:23.293
What I was trying to say

27:23.293 --> 27:26.209
was that everything
that I have blamed you for,

27:26.209 --> 27:28.647
I'm also guilty of doing.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.824
And that's on me.
That's my fault.

27:31.824 --> 27:33.869
I never really thought

27:33.869 --> 27:37.873
about what you might
be going through,

27:37.873 --> 27:41.181
that you would be hiding
the pain just as much as I was.

27:43.923 --> 27:46.621
I think we're both more alike

27:46.621 --> 27:49.015
than either of us
wants to admit.

27:54.629 --> 27:57.240
Well...

27:57.240 --> 27:58.851
um,

27:58.851 --> 28:01.418
I'm glad you're learning

28:01.418 --> 28:04.378
how much your behavior
affects other people.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.949
You're really growing up.

28:13.169 --> 28:15.084
And...

28:15.084 --> 28:19.698
I admit I have made
some mistakes too.

28:22.657 --> 28:25.704
I'm really sorry for that.

28:27.967 --> 28:30.273
It's a Christmas miracle.

28:31.971 --> 28:34.669
Why don't you two
just make up already?

28:42.851 --> 28:44.418
Yes, please.

29:16.058 --> 29:18.539
Are we gonna be like them
when we grow up?

29:18.539 --> 29:21.672
- Who?
- Andy and Kyle.

29:21.672 --> 29:24.501
No jobs, no lives.

29:24.501 --> 29:29.028
Just complete obsession
with all things Chucky.

29:29.028 --> 29:32.161
That is a terrifying thought.

29:32.161 --> 29:34.163
Every time
I get a wrong number,

29:34.163 --> 29:39.821
every time
we see someone with red hair,

29:39.821 --> 29:43.042
or even a certain kind of box,

29:43.042 --> 29:46.349
are we just always
gonna think it's him?

29:46.349 --> 29:48.525
Chucky's dead.

29:48.525 --> 29:50.527
So I've heard.

29:50.527 --> 29:52.791
I think we just need
to learn to live with it.

29:52.791 --> 29:56.838
Bad things will always happen,
whether Chucky's here or not.

29:56.838 --> 29:59.449
Wow, that makes me
feel so much better.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.758
You know
what makes me feel better?

30:05.673 --> 30:08.241
You two.

30:08.241 --> 30:09.764
You really do.

30:12.593 --> 30:14.682
Now I feel like a dick.

30:14.682 --> 30:17.554
- We love you anyways.
- Okay.

30:17.554 --> 30:19.992
Yeah, I love you too.

30:19.992 --> 30:21.732
I'm going to sleep.

30:21.732 --> 30:23.778
Good night, dorks.

30:28.652 --> 30:31.742
I'm sorry, Devon.

30:31.742 --> 30:33.875
It's okay.

30:33.875 --> 30:35.485
No, it's not.

30:37.400 --> 30:41.535
You're right,
and I think I was avoiding you.

30:41.535 --> 30:42.797
Why?

30:45.539 --> 30:48.194
I don't know, I...

30:48.194 --> 30:50.849
I thought
I wasn't good enough for you.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.894
That's insane.

30:52.894 --> 30:55.201
I let Chucky get to me twice.

30:56.942 --> 31:00.771
He got inside my head,
and people died.

31:00.771 --> 31:02.556
Chucky was the asshole.

31:02.556 --> 31:04.819
It's not your fault.

31:04.819 --> 31:06.473
Yeah, well,
Chucky may be gone,

31:06.473 --> 31:09.911
but you're still stuck
with the same old me.

31:09.911 --> 31:12.827
That's exactly
the you I want--

31:12.827 --> 31:15.569
the Jake who makes
weird fucking art.

31:17.614 --> 31:21.662
The Jake with long, curly hair.

31:21.662 --> 31:23.794
Oh, my God, I knew
you didn't like my haircut.

31:25.448 --> 31:29.626
And the Jake
who stands up for his friends,

31:29.626 --> 31:32.151
like you did with Lexy tonight.

31:32.151 --> 31:33.935
That's the Jake I love.

31:35.632 --> 31:38.113
I love you more, Devon.

31:38.113 --> 31:39.680
That's not possible.

31:41.725 --> 31:42.901
Coolio.

31:50.821 --> 31:52.649
Okay, this is very sweet,

31:52.649 --> 31:54.913
but can you two please
stop making out on my floor

31:54.913 --> 31:56.479
so I can get some sleep?

32:02.529 --> 32:04.009
You know...

32:06.359 --> 32:09.536
You're the best Christmas
present I've ever gotten.

32:09.536 --> 32:11.494
Speaking of which,
you did save the receipt

32:11.494 --> 32:13.801
for that podcast shit, right?

34:06.522 --> 34:10.352

34:14.704 --> 34:20.710

three nosy kids to slash.</i>

34:46.171 --> 34:49.696
No...

35:47.667 --> 35:48.842
Who's there?

35:50.931 --> 35:52.672
I'm gonna call the cops.

35:55.022 --> 35:57.372
Jennifer?

35:57.372 --> 35:59.374
Jennifer Tilly?

35:59.374 --> 36:02.203
Hi!
It's me, Mayor Michelle!

36:02.203 --> 36:03.596
Oh. Oh, hi.

36:03.596 --> 36:05.206
Remember we met last year
at the charity event

36:05.206 --> 36:07.339
for Better Days
Children's Hospitals?

36:07.339 --> 36:08.992
I know that didn't go so well.

36:08.992 --> 36:10.385
I hope you won't
hold that against me.

36:10.385 --> 36:12.344
Oh, no, not at all.

36:12.344 --> 36:13.693
Wait.

36:13.693 --> 36:15.216
Aren't you wanted for murder?

36:15.216 --> 36:18.045
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

36:18.045 --> 36:21.875
That was just
a big misunderstanding.

36:21.875 --> 36:24.051
- Oh.
- And that's why I'm here.

36:24.051 --> 36:26.923
Oh, my God.
This is so random.

36:26.923 --> 36:29.796
And I'm sorry to barge in
on your house

36:29.796 --> 36:31.450
on Christmas Eve...
- Oh, no worries.

36:31.450 --> 36:35.758
But I saw on your Instagram,
you have this doll.

36:35.758 --> 36:38.239
- Yes!
- This very rare doll,

36:38.239 --> 36:40.241
which I desperately need,

36:40.241 --> 36:44.463
because, well, you know,
that Good Guy doll shipment

36:44.463 --> 36:46.247
never did make it
to Better Days...

36:46.247 --> 36:47.988
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- And I feel

36:47.988 --> 36:49.729
if the public
were just reminded

36:49.729 --> 36:51.905
of all my charitable endeavors

36:51.905 --> 36:55.735
that perhaps they would make
that silly murder charge

36:55.735 --> 36:56.736
just go away--
- No, wait, wait.

36:56.736 --> 36:57.780
I need to post this.

36:57.780 --> 36:59.869
Oh, okay. Okay.

36:59.869 --> 37:02.089
Oh, my gosh.
I'm so excited.

37:02.089 --> 37:04.396
It's Jennifer Tilly!

37:06.267 --> 37:07.399
Uh...

37:07.399 --> 37:09.488
Oh, my gosh.
Smile!

37:09.488 --> 37:12.186
Okay.
- No.

37:19.411 --> 37:21.804
Aah!

37:59.538 --> 38:03.019
Man, that was quiet.

38:04.238 --> 38:06.980
Where have you been
all my life?

38:06.980 --> 38:08.982
Mwah!
- Chucky!

38:08.982 --> 38:10.766
You're supposed to be dead!

38:10.766 --> 38:16.250
You know, if I had a nickel
for every time I heard that...

38:16.250 --> 38:20.123
What are you doing here?
- None of your beeswax.

38:20.123 --> 38:22.909
Killing a mother
on Christmas Eve?

38:22.909 --> 38:25.172
You're despicable!

38:25.172 --> 38:28.871
You're just jealous
you didn't think of it first.

38:28.871 --> 38:31.439
What are those poor kids
gonna do now?

38:31.439 --> 38:34.355
They're gonna rest in pieces,

38:34.355 --> 38:36.052
just like their parents.

38:36.052 --> 38:38.141
Except for that Caroline.

38:38.141 --> 38:40.753
I think she's got potential.

38:40.753 --> 38:42.363
But...

38:42.363 --> 38:46.411
kids who misbehave
have to be punished.

38:46.411 --> 38:48.761
So where are they, Tiff?

38:48.761 --> 38:51.024
I don't know
who you're talking about.

38:51.024 --> 38:54.897
Glen and Glenda.
They disobeyed me.

38:54.897 --> 38:58.640
They have to be punished too, severely.

38:58.640 --> 39:00.686
Chucky.

39:00.686 --> 39:03.036
They're--they're dead.

39:03.036 --> 39:06.213
Come on, doll.
I wasn't born yesterday.

39:06.213 --> 39:08.911
I mean, technically, I was
born about three weeks ago.

39:08.911 --> 39:11.523
But I'm not stupid.

39:11.523 --> 39:13.220
I know what you're up to.

39:13.220 --> 39:17.137
I'm gonna find them
and punish them

39:17.137 --> 39:21.097
right after I punish
those brats upstairs.

39:21.097 --> 39:23.752
You're not gonna get
to them--any of them.

39:23.752 --> 39:25.711
You'll have to go
through me first.

39:25.711 --> 39:29.149
Ah, the scenic route.

39:29.149 --> 39:31.412
Aah!

39:36.504 --> 39:37.636
Hey!

39:37.636 --> 39:38.767
What did you do
to my mother?

39:38.767 --> 39:40.552
I'll fucking kill you!
- Tiff!

39:40.552 --> 39:42.902
Get this bitch off me!

39:42.902 --> 39:45.557
- No.
- Tiff, listen to me.

39:45.557 --> 39:47.776
I'm the last Chucky standing.

39:47.776 --> 39:51.563
If I die this time,
I die for good.

39:51.563 --> 39:53.434
Oh, dear.

39:53.434 --> 39:54.696
So sad.

39:54.696 --> 39:57.525
Tiff.

39:57.525 --> 39:59.571
Tiff!

39:59.571 --> 40:01.877
Lexy.

40:01.877 --> 40:03.966
Let me go,

40:03.966 --> 40:08.318
and I'll get you
all the drugs you'll ever need.

40:08.318 --> 40:11.800
This is the only drug I need.

40:11.800 --> 40:13.454

No. No, no.

41:25.439 --> 41:26.919
I just wanted...

41:31.576 --> 41:34.492
Devon, call the police.

41:37.582 --> 41:40.410
Devon, call the fucking cops!
She's gonna bleed out!

41:42.587 --> 41:44.458
You're lucky
he's such a good guy.

41:44.458 --> 41:48.114
No, Devon,
you're the lucky one.

41:57.906 --> 42:00.387
Hold this.

42:11.616 --> 42:13.269
Put the phone down.

42:19.058 --> 42:20.363
And the knives.

42:20.363 --> 42:21.626
Now.

42:25.194 --> 42:27.501
Let's go.
- Uh-huh.

42:27.501 --> 42:29.459
No. No, Caroline,
what are you doing?

42:30.809 --> 42:33.289
Chucky always told me,

42:33.289 --> 42:36.379
one day, my real mommy
would come for me.

42:37.816 --> 42:40.122
He told me a long time ago

42:40.122 --> 42:42.734
that the lady downstairs,

42:42.734 --> 42:44.910
she only adopted me.

42:44.910 --> 42:46.825
That's why I never fit in here.

42:46.825 --> 42:50.045
Caroline, it's not--

42:50.045 --> 42:51.351
he--he lied to you.

42:51.351 --> 42:53.919
You're not my real sister.

42:53.919 --> 42:56.574
Chucky told me everything.

42:56.574 --> 42:59.925
He told me to just pretend
to be afraid of him.

42:59.925 --> 43:01.883
And I fooled you.

43:01.883 --> 43:04.843
I fooled everyone.

43:04.843 --> 43:06.801
Clever girl.

43:06.801 --> 43:08.803
No.

43:08.803 --> 43:12.024
Caroline, he lies.
Remember?

43:13.808 --> 43:16.071
I'm your sister.
- She's lying.

43:16.071 --> 43:17.638
I'm your real sister.

43:17.638 --> 43:18.987
You're the liar.

43:21.599 --> 43:23.426
Now where is he, Lexy?

43:23.426 --> 43:26.821
What have you done with him?

43:26.821 --> 43:28.344
I killed him.

43:30.695 --> 43:32.740
For real this time.

43:32.740 --> 43:34.655
You'll be sorry, Lexy.

43:34.655 --> 43:37.179
You'll all be sorry.

43:40.008 --> 43:42.097
Mommy?
- Yes, honey?

43:42.097 --> 43:44.578
- Let's go.
- All right, Sweetface.

43:46.058 --> 43:47.712
Toodle-oo.

43:47.712 --> 43:48.974
No, Caroline. No.

43:48.974 --> 43:50.540
No. Please, no.

44:27.839 --> 44:30.189
Now I'm an orphan too.

44:34.062 --> 44:35.934
We got you.

44:35.934 --> 44:37.892
Okay.

44:37.892 --> 44:41.635
So you heard screams
around 11:45.

44:41.635 --> 44:42.941
You had reason
to believe

44:42.941 --> 44:44.899
that the suspect was
still in the house,

44:44.899 --> 44:47.554
so you acted in self-defense.

44:47.554 --> 44:50.296
Then the suspect
left the scene,

44:50.296 --> 44:53.081
taking your sister,
Caroline, hostage.

44:53.081 --> 44:54.169
Exactly.

44:54.169 --> 44:56.041
Had you seen
the suspect before?

44:56.041 --> 44:57.085
Absolutely.

44:59.522 --> 45:02.308
- It was Jennifer Tilly.
- Huh.

45:02.308 --> 45:03.831
Damn shame.

45:03.831 --> 45:06.007
I always thought
she was overrated.

45:06.007 --> 45:09.924
Anyway, since none of you
has any next of kin,

45:09.924 --> 45:11.578
we made an emergency call to--
- No, you don't understand.

45:11.578 --> 45:13.058
We need to find my sister now.

45:13.058 --> 45:15.364
I'm sorry, but we're trying
everything we can to--

45:15.364 --> 45:16.844
Oh, my God.

45:16.844 --> 45:18.672
Are you guys okay?
- Mrs. F.

45:18.672 --> 45:20.239
Oh, my God.

45:26.549 --> 45:27.855
Thanks for coming.

45:27.855 --> 45:30.249
We still have a lot
of forensic work to do here.

45:30.249 --> 45:33.034
Can you take them
somewhere safe today?

45:33.034 --> 45:36.298
Yeah.
Yeah, no problem.

45:36.298 --> 45:38.344
Lexy, I'm so sorry.

45:38.344 --> 45:41.564
Yeah, but right now,
we need your help.

45:41.564 --> 45:44.002
With or without the cops.

45:44.002 --> 45:45.568
Okay.

45:45.568 --> 45:47.919
What's going on?

45:47.919 --> 45:49.877
We have something
to tell you.

45:49.877 --> 45:52.358
It's gonna sound
completely insane.

45:54.534 --> 45:56.754
Mrs. F.,
do you remember Chucky?

46:01.846 --> 46:04.326
I knew it.

46:25.957 --> 46:27.393
Hello?

46:27.393 --> 46:29.264
<i>Hello, Tiffany.</i>

46:29.264 --> 46:30.962
Nica.

46:30.962 --> 46:33.007
<i>Look.</i>

46:33.007 --> 46:35.096
<i>I owe you an apology.</i>

46:36.271 --> 46:37.969
I'm sorry
about what happened with Glen.

46:37.969 --> 46:40.623
I, um...

46:40.623 --> 46:43.713
<i>I never wanted to hurt them.</i>

46:43.713 --> 46:45.628
<i>I'm glad
G.G.'s doing so well now.</i>

46:45.628 --> 46:48.414
Uh, you heard from G.G.?

46:50.111 --> 46:52.026
They call me once a week.

46:53.680 --> 46:56.944
Oh, well, t--

46:56.944 --> 46:59.164
tell them
I said hello, okay?

46:59.164 --> 47:00.948
<i>I will.</i>

47:00.948 --> 47:04.386
Tiffany,
nothing has changed between us.

47:05.953 --> 47:08.869
I'm still going to torture

47:08.869 --> 47:11.524
and kill you.

47:11.524 --> 47:13.091
<i>But I'm gonna give you
a head start.</i>

47:13.091 --> 47:14.092
Okay.

47:17.530 --> 47:20.968
