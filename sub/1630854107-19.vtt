00:07.170 --> 00:09.960
KNIGHT:
<i>Ugh, you got to be kidding me.</i>

00:10.160 --> 00:12.930
Navy Yard security
is backed up again.

00:13.130 --> 00:15.790
Let me guess. You're stuck
at the southeast gate.

00:15.990 --> 00:17.560
KNIGHT:
<i>Yep. It's the worst.</i>

00:17.760 --> 00:19.430
<i>And I even got an early</i>
<i>start this morning.</i>

00:19.630 --> 00:23.070
I noticed.
Where'd you rush off to?

00:23.270 --> 00:25.500
I woke up craving
pain au chocolat.

00:25.700 --> 00:28.670
Now, that's just a fancy way
of saying "chocolate croissant."

00:28.870 --> 00:30.810
Okay, well, don't let Parker
hear you say that.

00:31.010 --> 00:32.710
He's gonna consider
that blasphemy.

00:32.910 --> 00:34.250
Anyway, I'm bringing in a box,

00:34.450 --> 00:36.300
so you better bring
your appetite.

00:37.400 --> 00:38.620
Jimmy?

00:38.820 --> 00:40.890
Jess, I can't wait.
Yeah, I'm starving.

00:41.090 --> 00:43.970
Good, 'cause I got you two.
All right, see you soon.

00:47.240 --> 00:48.560
What the hell?

00:48.760 --> 00:50.710
(honking)

00:52.420 --> 00:53.430
(glass shatters)
(car horn blaring)

00:53.630 --> 00:55.420
(indistinct chatter)

00:59.220 --> 01:01.020
Stay back. I smell gas.

01:03.790 --> 01:05.440
Help, it's stuck!
I can't...

01:05.640 --> 01:06.810
(grunts)
Help!

01:07.010 --> 01:07.950
Okay. I got you.

01:08.150 --> 01:09.480
All right, out.
Hey! Help me.

01:09.680 --> 01:10.780
Grab him.
Keep him back.

01:10.980 --> 01:11.880
KID:
Get my mom!

01:12.080 --> 01:13.150
Yeah, I got her, I got her.
Mom!

01:13.350 --> 01:14.850
Okay. (grunting)

01:15.050 --> 01:15.920
It's stuck.

01:16.120 --> 01:17.720
On three. One, two,

01:17.920 --> 01:19.630
three. Okay,
come on, come on.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.890
Get away. Grab her.
Stay back, and let's...
(yells)

01:22.090 --> 01:23.550
I got him, I got him.

01:28.280 --> 01:29.850
Stay back.

01:30.550 --> 01:32.520
(gasps) Oh!

01:33.790 --> 01:35.770
Hi. Can I borrow this?

01:35.970 --> 01:37.890
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing? That's mine.

01:41.260 --> 01:43.500
* *

02:11.630 --> 02:14.650
KNIGHT: I woke up craving
pain au chocolat.

02:14.850 --> 02:17.780
Now, that's just a fancy way
of saying "chocolate croissant."

02:17.980 --> 02:19.320
Anyway, I'm bringing in a box,

02:19.520 --> 02:22.670
so you better bring
your appetite.

02:23.810 --> 02:27.330
Jimmy?
Jess, I can't wait.
Yeah, I'm starving.

02:27.530 --> 02:29.760
All right, see you soon.

02:29.960 --> 02:32.030
Damn, did Jimmy
just lie to Knight?

02:32.230 --> 02:33.330
Sure sounded like it.

02:33.530 --> 02:34.700
It was more a fib.

02:34.900 --> 02:37.040
First of all,
who uses the word "fib"?

02:37.240 --> 02:38.370
And second of all,

02:38.570 --> 02:41.740
it's just an
old-timey word for "lie."

02:41.940 --> 02:42.580
Who lied?

02:42.780 --> 02:44.210
Jimmy, to Knight.

02:44.410 --> 02:45.580
Ooh. Careful, Palmer.

02:45.780 --> 02:47.950
Lying to a federal agent--
that's a felony.

02:48.150 --> 02:51.150
It also comes with a, uh,
five-year, uh, prison sentence.

02:51.350 --> 02:54.020
Okay, very funny. All I said
was I was hungry.

02:54.220 --> 02:56.820
Oh, I believe the exact word
you used was "starving."

02:57.020 --> 02:59.120
Eh, so, more of a white lie.

02:59.330 --> 03:00.690
Yes, thank you.

03:00.890 --> 03:02.430
Jess said she bought me
some croissants.

03:02.630 --> 03:05.230
And I didn't tell her that I'd
already had three this morning.

03:05.430 --> 03:06.630
I mean, is that so terrible?

03:06.830 --> 03:08.570
I once told Vivian
that I was working late

03:08.770 --> 03:10.650
and went to a Bulls game
instead.

03:11.590 --> 03:13.390
We're divorced now.

03:14.420 --> 03:16.640
You know, I once hid a triple
homicide that happened

03:16.840 --> 03:18.340
in the apartment from Delilah.

03:18.540 --> 03:21.310
Ended up doing the dishes by
myself for the next six months.

03:21.510 --> 03:22.920
Wait, triple homicide,
seriously?

03:23.120 --> 03:26.650
And that is how Tim learned
not to lie to Delilah.

03:26.850 --> 03:28.620
Maybe I should call
Jess back now.

03:28.820 --> 03:29.620
(explosion in distance)

03:29.820 --> 03:31.540
What the hell was that?

03:32.680 --> 03:34.940
Looks like our
southeast gate.

03:37.980 --> 03:39.700
Says there's a crash
outside the Navy Yard.

03:39.900 --> 03:42.020
(sirens wailing in distance)

03:42.990 --> 03:45.020
(helicopter blades whirring)

03:47.420 --> 03:49.310
PARKER: Isn't that Knight's car?

03:49.510 --> 03:50.830
Jess.

03:53.700 --> 03:55.050
She's not in here.

03:55.250 --> 03:56.620
Jimmy. Parker.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.520
Hey. You okay?

03:58.720 --> 04:00.350
I don't think
the croissants made it.

04:00.550 --> 04:01.490
Your hand.

04:01.690 --> 04:03.060
Yeah, it's fine.

04:03.260 --> 04:04.190
What the hell happened?

04:04.390 --> 04:07.130
Sedan came out of nowhere,

04:07.330 --> 04:08.390
barely missed me and...

04:08.590 --> 04:10.500
Survivors?

04:10.700 --> 04:12.060
Woman and child.
They're with the paramedic.

04:12.260 --> 04:13.500
There was another guy
in the passenger seat

04:13.700 --> 04:15.550
but I didn't get to him in time.

04:16.320 --> 04:17.600
Hey, hey! Hey.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.200
Clear the road, move back.

04:19.410 --> 04:21.970
Hey. You sure you're okay?

04:22.170 --> 04:23.140
Yeah.

04:23.340 --> 04:25.530
Hey, Jimmy.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.160
I'm fine, I'm fine.

04:30.900 --> 04:32.520
Hey, dude, move.
You're in my shot.

04:32.720 --> 04:35.190
Dude, get back behind
the line. Come on.

04:35.390 --> 04:36.590
Okay, okay, okay.

04:36.790 --> 04:38.820
Behind the tape.

04:39.020 --> 04:40.430
You see that chick run, uh,

04:40.630 --> 04:42.830
run to the fire like she was
Wonder Woman or something?

04:43.030 --> 04:44.660
Yeah, I got
the whole thing on here.

04:44.860 --> 04:46.830
The whole thing, huh?
Most of it, yeah.

04:47.030 --> 04:48.530
Why?
I'm gonna need
that for evidence.

04:48.730 --> 04:49.670
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:49.870 --> 04:51.540
Dude.
I'll get you a receipt.

04:51.740 --> 04:54.260
Can you at least
call me an Uber?

04:55.960 --> 04:56.610
Hey.

04:56.810 --> 04:58.680
You saved us.

04:58.880 --> 04:59.780
You two all right?

04:59.980 --> 05:02.180
Thank you.
Adam is my everything.

05:02.380 --> 05:03.820
If you hadn't come, I...

05:04.020 --> 05:06.320
So you were driving pretty fast.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.390
Like, against-the-law fast.

05:08.590 --> 05:09.390
Where were you going?

05:09.590 --> 05:12.390
I... don't remember.

05:12.590 --> 05:14.030
(siren chirps)

05:14.230 --> 05:16.140
Mom.

05:17.180 --> 05:19.250
The police are here.

05:20.750 --> 05:21.930
(indistinct chatter)

05:22.130 --> 05:23.800
One sec,
I got to radio dispatch.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.020
Keep an eye on the mom.
She might have a concussion.

05:26.790 --> 05:27.840
We need to go.

05:28.040 --> 05:29.480
Whoa, whoa,
you can't leave yet.

05:29.680 --> 05:30.580
He's not done checking you out.

05:30.780 --> 05:32.210
No, we're fine, really.

05:32.410 --> 05:33.410
What about the police?

05:33.610 --> 05:34.580
They'll still have
to question you.

05:34.780 --> 05:35.750
No.

05:35.950 --> 05:37.520
(indistinct chatter)

05:37.720 --> 05:39.020
Please, no police.

05:39.220 --> 05:40.890
Why are you afraid
of the police?

05:41.090 --> 05:43.270
Please, I can't lose my son.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.980
Mom. They're coming.

06:01.690 --> 06:02.710
(siren wailing)

06:02.910 --> 06:04.310
PARKER:
Knight. Where are they heading?

06:04.510 --> 06:05.980
The woman has a concussion.

06:06.180 --> 06:08.450
Paramedics are taking her
to Washington General Hospital.

06:08.650 --> 06:10.050
I guess your team
will have to start

06:10.250 --> 06:11.780
by questioning eyewitnesses.

06:11.980 --> 06:13.020
Thanks.

06:13.220 --> 06:15.020
MPD can take over
the investigation.

06:15.220 --> 06:16.860
There's nothing more
for you to do.

06:17.060 --> 06:18.420
Oh, I don't know about that.

06:18.620 --> 06:20.360
The moment that woman saw
the police, she wanted to run.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.360
I mean, I would, too.
Driving like that?

06:22.560 --> 06:24.330
Well, she was going
somewhere in a hurry.

06:24.530 --> 06:26.200
Or running from something.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.730
She was scared the police
were gonna take her kid.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.470
Why?
I don't know.

06:30.670 --> 06:34.070
Hey, Parker, how do you feel
about us ditching the MPD?

06:34.270 --> 06:35.670
I'd like to see
this one through myself.

06:35.870 --> 06:39.010
TORRES: I mean, there is an
argument for jurisdiction.

06:39.210 --> 06:40.410
That wall is on

06:40.610 --> 06:41.980
Navy Yard property.

06:42.180 --> 06:44.180
Okay, sure, they're yours.

06:44.380 --> 06:46.640
Go find out
what spooked 'em.

06:51.610 --> 06:54.330
That's two accidents you've
gotten into this year.

06:54.530 --> 06:55.860
I didn't get
into an accident.

06:56.060 --> 06:57.300
Involved. You were involved.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.060
Without Dolly getting
a single scratch.

06:59.260 --> 07:00.670
Oh, Dolly, that's-that's
your car, right?

07:00.870 --> 07:03.470
I'm just saying Dolly
has pretty bad juju.

07:03.670 --> 07:05.300
It might be time
for her to retire.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.110
I do not need a new car.

07:07.310 --> 07:10.110
I get it. Hard to
let go of Dolly.

07:10.310 --> 07:12.340
Uh, is it just me,

07:12.550 --> 07:13.980
or are people
staring at us?

07:14.180 --> 07:17.600
I do have a guy that can help
you with a brand-new Mini.

07:18.900 --> 07:21.190
No, they are totally
staring at us.

07:21.390 --> 07:22.690
Jess, you can say no.

07:22.890 --> 07:24.420
You don't have to change
the subject.

07:24.620 --> 07:28.340
Uh, I think that guy
just took a selfie with us.

07:30.310 --> 07:33.280
Well, we are two of the most
beautiful people on the planet.

07:38.920 --> 07:40.270
Reyna, Adam,

07:40.470 --> 07:41.710
this is Special
Agent Torres.

07:41.910 --> 07:43.240
I never got a chance
to introduce myself,

07:43.440 --> 07:44.340
but I'm Jess.

07:44.540 --> 07:45.840
You didn't say you were police.

07:46.040 --> 07:48.880
Well, technically, we're not
the regular police.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.880
Regardless, we are here to help.

07:51.080 --> 07:53.090
Adam. <i>Siéntate.</i>

07:53.290 --> 07:56.240
Go listen to your music.
It's okay.

07:58.810 --> 08:00.440
(phone chimes)

08:07.780 --> 08:09.430
His father died a few years ago.

08:09.640 --> 08:11.900
So he thinks it's his job
to protect me.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.490
What is he? Ten?

08:14.390 --> 08:15.710
11.

08:15.910 --> 08:17.740
Yeah, I was a little younger
than him when,

08:17.940 --> 08:19.280
uh, my father left us.

08:19.480 --> 08:21.010
You know, it's not
easy for a kid

08:21.210 --> 08:22.210
to become the man of the house.

08:22.410 --> 08:24.380
He's all I have left.

08:24.580 --> 08:27.000
Reyna, why are you afraid
of the police?

08:28.670 --> 08:31.790
If you don't talk to us,
we can't help you.

08:31.990 --> 08:33.610
I...

08:35.110 --> 08:36.360
don't have papers.

08:36.560 --> 08:38.010
You're undocumented?

08:40.450 --> 08:43.540
And Adam?
I am guessing he was born here?

08:43.740 --> 08:45.540
Yes. And they told me
that they would deport me

08:45.740 --> 08:48.810
and put him in foster care
if I didn't...

08:49.010 --> 08:50.660
Didn't what?

08:51.960 --> 08:52.810
Reyna,

08:53.010 --> 08:54.680
why were you driving so fast?

08:54.880 --> 08:57.420
Daniel. I was...

08:57.620 --> 08:59.250
taking Daniel to the hospital.

08:59.450 --> 09:01.900
The man in the car?
And who's he?

09:04.140 --> 09:05.260
My brother.

09:05.460 --> 09:07.080
How did your brother get hurt?

09:10.380 --> 09:11.700
Time for your MRI, Ms. Vargas.

09:11.900 --> 09:13.000
Uh, we still have
a few more questions.

09:13.200 --> 09:14.380
They'll have to wait.

09:16.950 --> 09:18.800
And I'm afraid your son
will have to wait here.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.170
He can't come...?
Hospital policy.

09:21.370 --> 09:23.430
Um...

09:24.290 --> 09:25.940
You'll watch him? Yes?

09:26.140 --> 09:28.410
She'd love to.
She'd be happy to.
No, I'm-I'm not...

09:28.610 --> 09:30.180
Thank you.

09:30.380 --> 09:31.700
I trust you.

09:32.900 --> 09:34.220
<i>Mi amor.</i>

09:34.420 --> 09:36.500
You stay with Agent Knight.

09:37.540 --> 09:38.760
She will look after you.

09:38.960 --> 09:40.110
Hey.

09:43.210 --> 09:44.980
Yeah?

09:46.180 --> 09:48.420
Thank you.

09:52.420 --> 09:53.610
(sarcastic chuckle)

09:53.810 --> 09:54.910
"She'd be happy to"?

09:55.110 --> 09:57.780
Hey, did you notice
how she hesitated

09:57.980 --> 09:59.910
when I asked her
how her brother got hurt?

10:00.110 --> 10:02.350
Yeah, she's definitely
hiding something.

10:02.550 --> 10:03.520
The question is what?

10:03.720 --> 10:05.820
Yeah, I'll brief Parker.

10:06.020 --> 10:08.690
(phone chimes)
Whoa. 20 texts.

10:08.890 --> 10:11.220
Well, I guess I'm not
the only popular one.

10:11.420 --> 10:13.360
No, actually...

10:13.560 --> 10:14.630
You are.

10:14.830 --> 10:17.750
Your rescue has gone viral.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.330
Stay back.
NEWSWOMAN: Witnesses recorded

10:21.530 --> 10:25.170
this hero, already being called
Wonder Woman on social media,

10:25.370 --> 10:26.940
rushing to the burning car.

10:27.140 --> 10:29.810
They named her
after a superhero?

10:30.010 --> 10:32.950
Technically,
Wonder Woman is a demigod.

10:33.150 --> 10:34.880
Oh, that's much better.

10:35.080 --> 10:36.620
Knight's gonna have
the press all over her.

10:36.820 --> 10:38.120
Yeah, it's nothing
she can't handle.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.650
No harm in a little celebrity.

10:40.850 --> 10:42.790
Except for how the clamor
for insta fame

10:42.990 --> 10:45.060
is slowly destroying society.

10:45.260 --> 10:46.710
(phone chiming)

10:50.510 --> 10:52.000
Victoria, is everything okay?

10:52.200 --> 10:54.070
No, she's not...

10:54.270 --> 10:55.330
No, I can't bring...

10:55.530 --> 10:56.900
Honey, I'm at work.

10:57.100 --> 10:58.640
We'll talk about
this later, okay?

10:58.840 --> 11:00.540
All right. Love you.

11:00.740 --> 11:01.810
Victoria just wants to know

11:02.010 --> 11:03.310
when I'll pick her up
from school.

11:03.510 --> 11:05.280
And?
And if I'll bring Wonder Woman.

11:05.480 --> 11:07.350
So what do you got for me?
Well, I can tell you this man

11:07.550 --> 11:09.480
did not die in the explosion.

11:09.680 --> 11:12.420
A bullet pierced his liver,
lodged in his spine.

11:12.620 --> 11:13.590
He was shot?

11:13.790 --> 11:14.520
And he was already
bleeding to death

11:14.720 --> 11:15.750
before the accident.

11:15.950 --> 11:17.060
He wouldn't have
made it to the hospital.

11:17.260 --> 11:18.790
Reyna kind of skipped
over the part

11:18.990 --> 11:20.190
where her brother was shot.

11:20.390 --> 11:22.390
Maybe that's 'cause
he wasn't her brother.

11:22.590 --> 11:24.230
Got a hit on his DNA.

11:24.430 --> 11:25.200
That was fast.

11:25.400 --> 11:26.360
That's 'cause it came up

11:26.560 --> 11:28.500
in the federal
employee database.

11:28.700 --> 11:31.590
Victim's name
is Daniel Tanner.

11:32.020 --> 11:34.340
He was a DEA agent.

11:34.540 --> 11:38.010
What was Reyna doing with
a wounded DEA agent in her car?

11:38.210 --> 11:40.450
That's a good question.
A better one...

11:40.650 --> 11:42.530
Why lie about it?

11:49.740 --> 11:51.660
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Jensen to fourth floor
nurses' station.

11:51.860 --> 11:53.330
I just wanted some chips.

11:53.530 --> 11:54.390
Well, you're a growing boy.

11:54.590 --> 11:55.780
Dig in.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.710
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Physical therapy, dial 3172.

12:01.380 --> 12:03.740
What? He looked hungry.

12:03.940 --> 12:05.570
Oh, so you're not
trying to bribe him?

12:05.770 --> 12:08.560
(laughing): No.

12:09.620 --> 12:11.580
Possibly. But it works.

12:11.780 --> 12:13.010
I'm just letting you know
that this is why

12:13.210 --> 12:14.750
Victoria likes
hanging out with me.

12:14.950 --> 12:16.750
You know that's not
the only reason.

12:16.950 --> 12:18.780
She actually likes you.

12:18.980 --> 12:20.250
I know.

12:20.450 --> 12:22.220
I think. Maybe.

12:22.420 --> 12:24.990
It's just, Victoria is like
a little mini Jimmy Palmer.

12:25.190 --> 12:26.520
And it is in their DNA

12:26.720 --> 12:28.430
to like everyone.

12:28.630 --> 12:30.230
Mm-hmm. Not a lot of kids
are like that.

12:30.430 --> 12:32.130
I know. Most kids hate me.

12:32.330 --> 12:34.500
Okay, that is a bit extreme.

12:34.700 --> 12:36.180
(phones chiming)

12:38.420 --> 12:40.170
It's Parker.

12:40.370 --> 12:41.940
Oh, we got a problem.

12:42.140 --> 12:45.140
MAN (over P.A.): Code Green.
North building, third floor.

12:45.340 --> 12:46.610
Okay, Adam, we got to go.

12:46.810 --> 12:48.610
North building, third floor.

12:48.810 --> 12:50.380
TORRES:
Hey, nurse.

12:50.580 --> 12:51.680
Excuse me.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.590
What's Code Green?

12:53.790 --> 12:55.320
Missing patient.

12:55.520 --> 12:56.590
North building, third floor.

12:56.790 --> 12:58.390
TORRES:
Isn't that Reyna's nurse?

12:58.590 --> 12:59.890
Uh...

13:00.090 --> 13:01.890
Will you watch him?
Yeah, I got him, yeah.

13:02.090 --> 13:03.700
What happened? Where's Reyna?

13:03.900 --> 13:05.260
She just attacked me.

13:05.460 --> 13:06.770
I couldn't stop her.

13:06.970 --> 13:08.570
Where is she?
I don't know.

13:08.770 --> 13:10.370
She just ran off.

13:10.570 --> 13:11.740
She's gone.

13:11.940 --> 13:15.660
Code Green.
North building, third floor.

13:23.700 --> 13:25.550
According to the nurse,
as soon as they got to the MRI,

13:25.750 --> 13:28.090
Reyna knocked her out
and ran off.

13:28.290 --> 13:29.720
Well, security is
combing the building,

13:29.920 --> 13:30.960
but still no sign.

13:31.160 --> 13:32.490
I knew she wanted to run
after the crash,

13:32.690 --> 13:34.360
but I thought it was because
she was undocumented.

13:34.560 --> 13:38.560
Surprise, it was the dying DEA
agent in her passenger seat.

13:38.760 --> 13:39.630
But I don't get it.

13:39.830 --> 13:40.970
Reyna flipped out
when she thought

13:41.170 --> 13:42.270
Adam was gonna be
taken away from her.

13:42.470 --> 13:45.140
So, how could she just
leave him behind?

13:45.340 --> 13:48.170
We're missing something.

13:48.370 --> 13:50.430
We're gonna have
to talk to the kid.

13:52.260 --> 13:53.750
Where's my mom?

13:53.950 --> 13:55.110
We don't know yet, Adam.

13:55.310 --> 13:56.710
Yes, you do. You're lying.

13:56.920 --> 13:57.780
TORRES:
Adam...

13:57.980 --> 13:59.080
You have to trust us.

13:59.280 --> 14:00.600
You know where
your mother could be?

14:01.640 --> 14:02.650
It's your fault.

14:02.850 --> 14:03.690
She wouldn't have left me.

14:03.890 --> 14:05.510
You scared her off.
Hey.

14:06.810 --> 14:08.460
No one is to blame here.

14:08.660 --> 14:09.430
Okay?

14:09.630 --> 14:11.630
I'll take Adam
back to NCIS.

14:11.830 --> 14:13.170
You want to stay here,
see if you can grab

14:13.370 --> 14:14.400
any footage off
the security cams?

14:14.600 --> 14:15.930
I'm not going anywhere with you.

14:16.130 --> 14:17.870
Adam.

14:18.070 --> 14:19.470
What did your mother say?

14:19.670 --> 14:22.160
She said stay with
Agent Knight, right?

14:23.090 --> 14:24.340
Your mother trusted her.

14:24.540 --> 14:26.010
And you're a smart kid, right?

14:26.210 --> 14:27.700
You do what your
mother says?

14:28.730 --> 14:29.760
Good.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.570
We're gonna find your mother.

14:37.810 --> 14:39.990
It's not you he hates.

14:40.190 --> 14:42.710
Are you sure about that?

14:47.850 --> 14:49.550
Adam, this is Kasie.

14:54.390 --> 14:56.360
Would you like
anything to drink?

14:57.130 --> 14:59.140
Okay, so why don't you take
a seat in the back

14:59.340 --> 15:01.460
and then, um, I'll be in
in a second?

15:07.340 --> 15:10.220
Talk about a cold shoulder.

15:10.420 --> 15:12.860
You have had a morning,
Double Dubs.

15:13.060 --> 15:13.890
Double what?

15:14.090 --> 15:15.130
Double Dubs.

15:15.330 --> 15:16.860
As in Double Ws.

15:17.060 --> 15:17.900
Wonder Woman.

15:18.100 --> 15:19.130
(laughs)
Oh, please.

15:19.330 --> 15:21.020
Oh, speaking of
which, hold on.

15:21.820 --> 15:25.200
Okay, we have literally taken
hundreds of selfies together.

15:25.400 --> 15:26.800
Before you were famous, sure.

15:27.010 --> 15:30.340
Oh, man, the background
is terrible.

15:30.540 --> 15:31.740
If we could just
step over...
Kase.

15:31.940 --> 15:34.550
Okay, fine, I'm
just proud of you,

15:34.750 --> 15:36.480
but we will
revisit this later.

15:36.680 --> 15:38.950
Now, the bullet that Jimmy
pulled out of Agent Tanner

15:39.150 --> 15:40.490
was a nine millimeter.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.590
We haven't recovered Tanner's
service weapon yet,

15:42.790 --> 15:45.360
so on a hunch,
I reached out to the DEA

15:45.560 --> 15:47.680
to compare ballistics
to his weapon.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.200
And it's a match.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.130
Tanner was shot
by his own gun.

15:52.330 --> 15:53.880
ADAM:
My mom didn't do it.

15:54.820 --> 15:56.450
Um...

15:57.420 --> 15:59.000
I-I didn't say that she did.

15:59.200 --> 16:00.520
But you were thinking it.

16:02.420 --> 16:03.980
What can you tell us
about Daniel?

16:04.180 --> 16:05.480
He's my mom's friend.

16:05.680 --> 16:06.710
That's all I know.

16:06.910 --> 16:08.380
And how did he
end up in the car?

16:08.580 --> 16:09.810
I don't know that either.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.150
I was home.

16:11.350 --> 16:13.220
My mother went out,
then came back all upset.

16:13.420 --> 16:14.650
Said we had to go.

16:14.850 --> 16:16.490
When I got in the car,
he was already there.

16:16.690 --> 16:18.060
But she wouldn't hurt him.

16:18.260 --> 16:20.030
She wouldn't hurt anyone.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.160
O-Okay, I believe you.

16:22.360 --> 16:24.980
No, you don't.

16:30.420 --> 16:32.170
Well...

16:32.370 --> 16:33.210
Do you believe him?

16:33.410 --> 16:34.710
I do.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.510
But his mother?

16:36.710 --> 16:39.280
I think she either knows
who shot Agent Tanner...

16:39.480 --> 16:41.110
Or she shot him herself.

16:41.310 --> 16:43.250
Yeah.
Either way,

16:43.450 --> 16:45.320
one thing's clear:
that kid hates your guts.

16:45.520 --> 16:46.780
Which is why I can't
track down Reyna

16:46.980 --> 16:49.750
if I have him following
me around...

16:49.950 --> 16:52.090
Ah, so you want me
to watch him.

16:52.290 --> 16:53.190
Yep, fine, I'll do it.

16:53.390 --> 16:54.590
For Wonder Woman.

16:54.790 --> 16:56.960
Mm. Thank you, Kasie.
You are a lifesaver.

16:57.160 --> 17:00.230
Yes, and you owe me
that selfie later.

17:00.430 --> 17:03.340
Tanner deserved a heck of lot
more than a bullet to the gut.

17:03.540 --> 17:05.600
Any idea how your partner
got shot?

17:05.800 --> 17:09.370
No, but I'm sure as hell
gonna find out.

17:09.570 --> 17:10.840
(knocking)

17:11.040 --> 17:13.410
Agents McGee and Parker.

17:13.610 --> 17:15.980
This is Agent Raymond Frank
of the DEA.

17:16.180 --> 17:18.180
He was Agent Tanner's partner.

17:18.380 --> 17:20.920
Well, we're, uh,
we're sorry for your loss.

17:21.120 --> 17:23.190
I spoke with
Administrator Henderson.

17:23.390 --> 17:25.960
We both agreed you should all
work together on this case.

17:26.160 --> 17:27.230
So, where we at?

17:27.430 --> 17:29.730
We've got a BOLO out
for Reyna Vargas.

17:29.930 --> 17:32.030
You want to tell us what
she was doing for the DEA?

17:32.230 --> 17:34.500
What makes you think
she was doing anything?

17:34.700 --> 17:37.570
Well, her immigration
application.

17:37.770 --> 17:39.600
She applied for residency.

17:39.800 --> 17:42.570
Now, the application
was slowly moving along

17:42.770 --> 17:44.510
when suddenly
it was put on hold.

17:44.710 --> 17:46.540
And you assume
we had a role in that?

17:46.740 --> 17:49.380
Come on, Frank. FBI pulls
that kind of deal all the time.

17:49.580 --> 17:51.880
Identify undocumented immigrants

17:52.080 --> 17:53.620
and send 'em
into the lion's den.

17:53.820 --> 17:55.850
PARKER:
They gather intel on the...

17:56.050 --> 17:58.860
this drug lord
or that arms dealer...

17:59.060 --> 18:01.530
All in exchange for
becoming a legal resident.

18:01.730 --> 18:03.600
Reyna was an informant
for the DEA.

18:03.800 --> 18:06.150
Your team's as good
as advertised.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.370
Okay, yes.

18:09.570 --> 18:12.370
Reyna was part of
an off-the-books op.

18:12.570 --> 18:14.390
Who was she informing on?

18:15.560 --> 18:17.760
The Serrano cartel.

18:19.330 --> 18:21.380
These brothers are bad news.

18:21.580 --> 18:22.610
That's Mateo Serrano.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.080
He operates out of D.C.

18:24.280 --> 18:26.280
The cartel's eastern territories
all answer to him.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.890
This guy looks like he should
be running a tech startup.

18:29.090 --> 18:31.490
(phone ringing)
FRANK:
On paper, Mateo appears clean.

18:31.690 --> 18:34.180
By all appearances,
an entrepreneur.

18:35.210 --> 18:37.550
D-Does someone want to get that?

18:41.850 --> 18:43.970
(clears throat)
Got it. Continue.

18:44.170 --> 18:46.890
So, uh, who does
Mateo's dirty work?

18:47.660 --> 18:49.110
FRANK:
This mean bastard.

18:49.310 --> 18:51.480
Mateo's brother Isaac Serrano.

18:51.680 --> 18:53.550
Arrested for assault,
attempted murder,

18:53.750 --> 18:55.050
but no convictions.

18:55.250 --> 18:56.780
FRANK:
Mateo and Isaac
run a tight ship.

18:56.980 --> 18:59.350
Their operation's been
nearly impossible to breach.

18:59.550 --> 19:01.940
(phone ringing)

19:07.180 --> 19:08.530
Reporters.

19:08.730 --> 19:10.300
No rest for Wonder Woman.

19:10.500 --> 19:11.530
That's you?

19:11.730 --> 19:13.130
Mm. (laughs)

19:13.330 --> 19:16.020
Okay, so back to Reyna.
How's she involved in this?

19:17.020 --> 19:18.870
FRANK:
She's a waitress
at Mateo's Taqueria.

19:19.070 --> 19:20.710
It's one of his
legitimate businesses.

19:20.910 --> 19:23.140
Also a good way to launder
the drug money, I'm guessing.

19:23.340 --> 19:24.580
And they launder a lot.

19:24.780 --> 19:26.580
Reyna was our way into
their whole operation.

19:26.780 --> 19:28.280
Agent Tanner was her handler.

19:28.480 --> 19:29.510
Was there any tension between

19:29.710 --> 19:31.020
the two of them
that you knew about?

19:31.220 --> 19:32.750
Not really.

19:32.950 --> 19:34.550
Seemed to me he'd built
a great rapport

19:34.750 --> 19:37.820
with both her and the kid.

19:38.020 --> 19:39.190
But, uh...

19:39.390 --> 19:40.560
But?

19:40.760 --> 19:42.060
Tanner did say Reyna
was getting pretty angry

19:42.260 --> 19:44.160
that her visa hadn't
gone through yet.

19:44.360 --> 19:45.830
Angry enough to shoot him?

19:46.030 --> 19:48.320
Not an easy picture, right?

19:49.180 --> 19:51.470
But Tanner recruited her because
he thought she was tough enough

19:51.670 --> 19:53.910
to spy against the Serranos
and not crack.

19:54.110 --> 19:55.740
Those people aren't
easy to come by.

19:55.940 --> 19:58.910
I don't know what happened
between her and Tanner, but...

19:59.110 --> 20:01.850
if she didn't shoot him,
where is she?

20:02.050 --> 20:04.650
Well, Torres is working on
getting the security footage

20:04.850 --> 20:06.780
from the hospital.
May be a lead there.

20:06.980 --> 20:08.550
Tough or not,
she had to be terrified

20:08.750 --> 20:10.560
being an informant
against the Serranos.

20:10.760 --> 20:12.160
That's why Tanner
pulled the trigger

20:12.360 --> 20:14.530
and had Reyna plant a recording
device in Mateo's office.

20:14.730 --> 20:15.690
It was risky, but...

20:15.890 --> 20:16.690
if it gave us
something concrete,

20:16.890 --> 20:17.900
we could pull Reyna out

20:18.100 --> 20:18.760
and make a move.

20:18.960 --> 20:20.230
By any chance is this

20:20.430 --> 20:22.220
the device you're talking about?

20:23.650 --> 20:25.200
'Cause Kasie found
one in the car.

20:25.400 --> 20:26.900
Maybe that's why Reyna
and Tanner met.

20:27.100 --> 20:29.040
She was making the handoff.

20:29.240 --> 20:30.980
FRANK:
If that's ours, it could be key
in our case against Serrano.

20:31.180 --> 20:32.680
Think your forensic tech
can salvage it?

20:32.880 --> 20:35.750
Absolutely. Woman's
a miracle worker. Real pro.

20:35.950 --> 20:38.550
Ah, are you guys ready?

20:38.750 --> 20:39.620
So ready.

20:39.820 --> 20:40.720
I don't know
about this, Kasie.

20:40.920 --> 20:41.620
A-Are you sure
that this is safe?

20:41.820 --> 20:42.690
No, I am not.

20:42.890 --> 20:43.620
Which is why you're in charge

20:43.820 --> 20:45.010
of the fire extinguisher.

20:47.510 --> 20:50.900
Three, two, one-- ooh.

20:51.100 --> 20:52.600
All right, Kase,
now maybe we should...
Hit it, Adam.

20:52.800 --> 20:54.080
Fire in the hole!

20:56.520 --> 20:57.670
How'd you do that?

20:57.870 --> 20:59.170
Calcium carbide and water.

20:59.370 --> 21:00.640
I told you science was cool.

21:00.840 --> 21:02.170
That was awesome.

21:02.370 --> 21:03.240
Oh, Jimmy?

21:03.440 --> 21:04.340
You okay there, buddy?

21:04.540 --> 21:06.340
Do you have
any more watermelon?

21:06.540 --> 21:08.410
(laughter)

21:08.610 --> 21:10.480
Do I look like
Gallagher to you?

21:10.680 --> 21:11.480
(laughter)

21:11.680 --> 21:12.880
Okay, this is more like it.

21:13.080 --> 21:15.100
Adam, it's good to see
you having some fun.

21:17.970 --> 21:19.590
(groans)

21:19.790 --> 21:21.460
Kasie's just prepping
for Halloween.

21:21.660 --> 21:22.530
With watermelon?

21:22.730 --> 21:24.660
Hey. You have any idea

21:24.860 --> 21:27.060
how hard it is
to find a pumpkin in May?

21:27.260 --> 21:29.670
I think he'd like
to see me blow up next.

21:29.870 --> 21:31.100
That was awesome.

21:31.300 --> 21:34.070
I'll keep him away from
any flammable materials.

21:34.270 --> 21:36.960
In the meantime,
you got a second?
Yeah.

21:38.930 --> 21:40.680
Oh, don't touch
that, please.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.050
You bring me someone
else to babysit?

21:42.250 --> 21:44.420
Forensic scientist
Kasie Hines,

21:44.620 --> 21:45.620
say hello to Agent Frank

21:45.820 --> 21:46.850
with the DEA.

21:47.050 --> 21:49.790
Agent Raymond Frank of the DEA.

21:49.990 --> 21:51.520
Mm-hmm.
Lucy speaks
very highly of you.

21:51.720 --> 21:52.760
Who's Lucy?

21:52.960 --> 21:55.010
Uh, she's our Kasie.

21:55.610 --> 21:56.930
What can I do for you,
Agent Frank?

21:57.130 --> 21:58.530
KNIGHT:
Uh, we need to take a look

21:58.730 --> 22:00.100
at the recording device
you found.

22:00.300 --> 22:01.300
Oh.

22:01.500 --> 22:02.500
You mean...

22:02.700 --> 22:04.250
this teeny little thing?

22:05.320 --> 22:06.170
That's it.

22:06.370 --> 22:07.310
That's what Tanner gave Reyna

22:07.510 --> 22:08.770
to plant in Serrano's office.

22:08.970 --> 22:10.680
Were you able to pull any
of the audio off of it?

22:10.880 --> 22:12.710
I'm not a miracle worker.

22:12.910 --> 22:14.410
Not what I heard.

22:14.610 --> 22:15.880
Well, it's burnt to a crisp.

22:16.080 --> 22:17.250
Along with whatever's on it.

22:17.450 --> 22:19.550
So we're back
to blowing up watermelons?

22:19.750 --> 22:22.150
(phone chimes)

22:22.350 --> 22:23.870
Or maybe not.

22:25.170 --> 22:27.340
Torres just got back
from the hospital.

22:35.880 --> 22:38.270
You must be Agent Torres.
You're Frank, right?

22:38.470 --> 22:39.900
Yeah, nice to meet you.
Yeah, you, too.

22:40.100 --> 22:41.340
So it took a little, uh, doing,

22:41.540 --> 22:45.440
but I finally got the hospital
security footage.

22:45.640 --> 22:49.210
So, Reyna and the nurse left
for the MRI at around 9:30 a.m.

22:49.410 --> 22:51.820
Can you, uh, fast-forward?
Yep.

22:52.020 --> 22:53.450
KNIGHT:
That's backwards.

22:53.650 --> 22:55.240
Yeah, yeah.

22:56.270 --> 22:57.840
Little faster.

23:01.640 --> 23:04.050
There. Back that up.

23:07.080 --> 23:07.870
Where are they going?

23:08.070 --> 23:09.900
The MRI is the other way.

23:10.100 --> 23:11.140
Hold on.

23:11.340 --> 23:12.670
(typing)

23:12.870 --> 23:15.690
Pulling up
the parking garage.

23:18.460 --> 23:22.000
Why would a nurse take a patient
to a parking garage?

23:22.930 --> 23:25.150
Something's wrong.

23:25.350 --> 23:26.720
Whoa.

23:26.920 --> 23:28.770
KNIGHT:
Why is she running?

23:29.840 --> 23:31.970
TORRES:
Damn, he has a gun.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.260
Reyna didn't run away.

23:36.460 --> 23:37.850
She's kidnapped.

23:49.060 --> 23:51.180
How'd the Serranos even know
where to find Reyna?

23:51.380 --> 23:53.210
Yeah, with the media coverage
your Wonder Woman's gotten,

23:53.410 --> 23:54.880
I can't say I'm surprised.

23:55.080 --> 23:57.380
If Nurse Allegra in there
works for Serrano...

23:57.580 --> 23:59.800
letting her sweat it out
is not gonna work.

24:05.070 --> 24:06.820
(door closes)

24:07.020 --> 24:08.130
How's your eye?

24:08.330 --> 24:09.390
Will this take long?

24:09.590 --> 24:10.730
I have to pick my
daughter up from school.

24:10.930 --> 24:12.480
You may need to call
somebody for that.

24:14.480 --> 24:15.850
Who are they?

24:18.020 --> 24:19.820
Cat got your tongue?

24:22.220 --> 24:23.640
I don't know who they are.

24:23.840 --> 24:24.840
Really?

24:25.040 --> 24:26.680
You just hand off
one of your patients

24:26.880 --> 24:29.500
to some random strangers
in a garage?

24:31.230 --> 24:32.950
If you talk to us,

24:33.150 --> 24:34.420
we can protect you.

24:34.620 --> 24:36.190
But if Reyna Vargas dies

24:36.390 --> 24:38.460
or that little boy
loses his mother,

24:38.660 --> 24:41.640
that is on you.

24:43.210 --> 24:45.310
(sobbing)

24:49.750 --> 24:51.200
Please.

24:51.400 --> 24:52.800
They made me.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.210
Who's they?

24:54.410 --> 24:56.740
It was just before my shift.

24:56.940 --> 24:59.110
I got out of my car
and these two men cornered me,

24:59.310 --> 25:01.550
took my purse. I thought they
were robbing me, but...

25:01.750 --> 25:04.180
they just took
my driver's license.

25:04.380 --> 25:06.280
(sobbing):
They said...

25:06.480 --> 25:08.650
they know where I live now.

25:08.850 --> 25:10.660
And they would hurt my family

25:10.860 --> 25:13.090
if I don't bring
Reyna out to them.

25:13.290 --> 25:14.910
Who are they, Allegra?

25:16.380 --> 25:17.700
We just need their names.

25:17.900 --> 25:19.930
I don't know their names.

25:20.130 --> 25:22.830
But one of them had
a scar on his face.

25:23.030 --> 25:24.090
Like this.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.960
Is this the man
you're talking about?

25:34.230 --> 25:36.280
Uh-oh.
What's with the "uh-oh"?

25:36.480 --> 25:37.520
We just got an eyewitness

25:37.720 --> 25:39.580
accusing Isaac Serrano
of kidnapping.

25:39.780 --> 25:42.090
If Isaac Serrano
came for Reyna himself,

25:42.290 --> 25:45.190
he's gonna want to make
an example of her.

25:45.390 --> 25:47.120
I know where Reyna is.

25:47.320 --> 25:48.230
Let's hear it.

25:48.430 --> 25:49.960
The van they used to abduct her

25:50.160 --> 25:51.300
had a broken taillight.

25:51.500 --> 25:53.030
You tracked a broken taillight?

25:53.230 --> 25:54.470
The street cams are a goldmine

25:54.670 --> 25:55.730
when you know what
you're looking for.

25:55.930 --> 25:57.000
So where is she?

25:57.200 --> 25:58.970
FRANK:
Mateo's Taqueria.

25:59.170 --> 26:01.410
That cocky bastard took Reyna
back to their home base.

26:01.610 --> 26:02.510
That's deep
in Serranos territory.

26:02.710 --> 26:04.210
They have eyes on every corner.

26:04.410 --> 26:06.180
McGEE: They're probably thinking
Serrano's untouchable in there.

26:06.380 --> 26:07.580
Yeah, he was.

26:07.780 --> 26:09.080
But now we have
probable cause

26:09.280 --> 26:10.280
to go in and round 'em up.

26:10.480 --> 26:11.650
Easy there, cowboy.

26:11.850 --> 26:13.990
You're not going in
guns a-blazing.

26:14.190 --> 26:15.620
In fact, you're not
going in at all.

26:15.820 --> 26:17.090
Parker, they killed my partner.

26:17.290 --> 26:18.320
We don't know that.

26:18.520 --> 26:20.320
I know that.

26:20.520 --> 26:22.330
Would you wait on the sidelines
if it was one of yours?

26:22.530 --> 26:23.860
No. I wouldn't.

26:24.060 --> 26:25.500
But if you're coming, we got
to have an understanding.

26:25.700 --> 26:27.130
Okay, make me understand.

26:27.330 --> 26:28.980
This is our op.

26:31.450 --> 26:33.490
So it's our rules.

26:34.420 --> 26:35.670
Fine.

26:35.870 --> 26:37.040
McGEE: And someone's
gonna have to go in first.

26:37.240 --> 26:39.110
Do some recon,
get the lay of the land.

26:39.310 --> 26:41.110
At least let that be me.

26:41.310 --> 26:43.820
No offense, but, uh,
Serrano's men will make you.

26:44.020 --> 26:45.450
Maybe before you
even clear the door.

26:45.650 --> 26:48.120
Torres, you go in first.
Good.

26:48.320 --> 26:50.220
I've been craving some, uh,

26:50.420 --> 26:51.690
money-laundered tacos.

26:51.890 --> 26:53.490
Don't forget we got
civilians in there.

26:53.690 --> 26:54.960
You need to find a way
to evacuate them

26:55.160 --> 26:57.010
before we can get inside.
Roger.

26:58.650 --> 27:01.330
Uh... we got this, Knight.

27:01.530 --> 27:02.630
You're staying.

27:02.830 --> 27:05.970
But hostage situations
are my forte.

27:06.170 --> 27:09.440
Yeah, but right now Wonder Woman
is way too recognizable.

27:09.640 --> 27:11.480
I can't risk compromising
the mission.

27:11.680 --> 27:13.240
Besides, you also
promised the mom

27:13.440 --> 27:14.750
that you'd take
care of the kid, so...

27:14.950 --> 27:16.310
Look, look, I get it.

27:16.510 --> 27:17.750
Kids hate me, too.

27:17.950 --> 27:20.650
I'm no natural, not like
Torres or Kasie, but...

27:20.850 --> 27:22.250
I've learned it doesn't matter.

27:22.450 --> 27:23.760
Kids don't need
to love you.

27:23.960 --> 27:25.760
So, what do they need?

27:25.960 --> 27:28.030
To know they can depend on you.

27:28.230 --> 27:30.160
So go on,
Wonder Woman.

27:30.360 --> 27:31.900
Fantastic Four has got this.

27:32.100 --> 27:34.430
And I used to like comic books.

27:34.630 --> 27:36.650
(sighs)

27:39.120 --> 27:40.170
The usual for you, Jess?

27:40.370 --> 27:41.540
Yes, thank you, Elaine.

27:41.740 --> 27:43.370
How about you, hon?

27:43.570 --> 27:44.510
I'm not hungry.

27:44.710 --> 27:46.780
Not even for a cheeseburger?

27:46.980 --> 27:48.710
I got a grandson your age.

27:48.910 --> 27:50.580
He inhales two in one sitting.

27:50.780 --> 27:52.650
Yum. That sounds delicious.

27:52.850 --> 27:55.520
How about we do that
with curly fries?

27:55.720 --> 27:57.140
How's that sound?

28:01.540 --> 28:03.960
(clears throat)
Okay, no, no.

28:04.160 --> 28:05.960
We are not doing
this dance again.

28:06.160 --> 28:08.270
You cannot ignore me
this entire dinner.

28:08.470 --> 28:09.770
I said I wasn't hungry.

28:09.970 --> 28:11.500
You should've just
left me with Kasie.

28:11.700 --> 28:12.840
Well, no can do.

28:13.040 --> 28:15.660
From now on,
you are stuck with me.

28:19.860 --> 28:21.880
I told your mom
I would take care of you.

28:22.080 --> 28:23.980
And I'm going to keep
that promise.

28:24.180 --> 28:25.220
Okay?

28:25.420 --> 28:26.900
Okay.

28:30.370 --> 28:31.840
Sir.

28:32.970 --> 28:35.610
Put the phone away
before I confiscate it.

28:37.480 --> 28:39.250
(whispering):
Can you do that?

28:40.010 --> 28:42.300
(whispering):
No, but he doesn't know that.

28:42.500 --> 28:44.140
(soft laugh)

28:44.340 --> 28:45.890
(chuckles)

28:47.220 --> 28:49.090
So what are you
listening to, anyway?

28:50.260 --> 28:51.810
You want to hear?

28:52.010 --> 28:53.760
Sure.

28:56.430 --> 28:57.950
I mix my own tracks.

28:58.150 --> 28:59.750
* *

28:59.950 --> 29:01.020
KASIE:
* Hit-hit-hit it, Adam *

29:01.220 --> 29:02.900
ADAM:
* Fire in the hole! *

29:03.810 --> 29:04.890
JIMMY:
* Do we have any more *

29:05.090 --> 29:06.260
* Wa-Wa-Watermelon? *
(laughs)

29:06.460 --> 29:07.660
KASIE:
* Hit-hit-hit it, Adam... *

29:07.860 --> 29:08.990
Is that Kasie?

29:09.190 --> 29:10.260
JIMMY:
* Do we have any more... *

29:10.460 --> 29:11.430
And that's Jimmy.

29:11.630 --> 29:12.560
* Wa-Wa-Watermelon... *

29:12.760 --> 29:14.930
You made this? This is amazing.

29:15.130 --> 29:16.770
KASIE:
* Hit-hit-hit it, Adam. *

29:16.970 --> 29:18.600
There's a lot of sounds
that people ignore.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.400
You know, like...

29:20.600 --> 29:23.140
(clinking)

29:23.340 --> 29:24.580
The car alarm outside.

29:24.780 --> 29:26.180
(alarm blaring)
It's been going on
for a minute,

29:26.380 --> 29:28.060
but no one's even looked up.

29:29.030 --> 29:30.250
Huh.

29:30.450 --> 29:31.880
(alarm shuts off)
You're very perceptive, Adam.

29:32.080 --> 29:34.670
Uncle Dan said I'd make
a good investigator.

29:35.870 --> 29:37.420
Did you spend a lot
of time with him?

29:37.620 --> 29:39.320
Some. He'd record cool sounds

29:39.520 --> 29:41.390
and bring them for me
to use in my music.

29:41.590 --> 29:42.760
And we had this game.

29:42.960 --> 29:43.900
He'd play these random cues

29:44.100 --> 29:45.130
and make me guess
what they were.

29:45.330 --> 29:46.700
I always got it right.

29:46.900 --> 29:47.970
I bet you did.

29:48.170 --> 29:49.870
But my mom?
She got it wrong.

29:50.070 --> 29:51.600
She doesn't have the ear.

29:51.800 --> 29:54.910
That's what Dan said. She...

29:55.110 --> 29:56.810
Hey.

29:57.010 --> 29:59.730
Hey, Adam, she's gonna be okay.

30:03.200 --> 30:05.370
You know how good
you are at this?

30:06.970 --> 30:10.200
My team is really good
at what they do, too.

30:11.040 --> 30:13.640
And they're gonna bring
your mom home.

30:15.380 --> 30:17.430
("Quiero Que Sepas"
by Los Reyes Toreros playing)

30:17.630 --> 30:19.680
In position.

30:21.720 --> 30:22.970
The hallway leads
to the restroom,

30:23.170 --> 30:24.640
the kitchen has a back door.

30:24.840 --> 30:26.170
PARKER:
How about the clientele?

30:26.370 --> 30:27.670
Unsavory.

30:27.870 --> 30:30.440
We got two men,
potential cartel members.

30:30.640 --> 30:33.830
Could be packing heat.
Six others. And the staff.

30:42.440 --> 30:44.140
(both laugh)

30:50.580 --> 30:53.030
(waitress speaks Spanish)

30:53.230 --> 30:54.730
You, uh, know what
they're saying?

30:54.930 --> 30:57.400
Nope, but that is definitely
Torres' bedroom voice.

30:57.600 --> 30:59.470
Your agent's flirting
with one of the waitresses?

30:59.670 --> 31:01.420
Just let him do his thing.

31:15.600 --> 31:17.620
Mateo's definitely here.

31:17.820 --> 31:19.820
We need visual
confirmation, Nick.

31:20.020 --> 31:22.390
Can't go in unless you got
Mateo or Reyna in sight.

31:22.590 --> 31:24.000
McGEE: Got too many civilians.

31:24.200 --> 31:26.260
Well, I can't exactly wait
forever for him to come out.

31:26.460 --> 31:28.930
And Mateo's not gonna parade
her around the restaurant.

31:29.130 --> 31:32.700
I think it's time
for a fire drill.

31:32.900 --> 31:34.010
Nick, be careful.

31:34.210 --> 31:35.540
We don't want
to alert the Serranos.

31:35.740 --> 31:36.540
Well, you want it careful

31:36.740 --> 31:37.540
or you want it effective?

31:37.740 --> 31:38.710
It can't be both.

31:38.910 --> 31:40.190
Effective.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.030
All right, get in position.

31:46.600 --> 31:49.470
(fire alarm ringing)

31:53.510 --> 31:56.180
McGee, we're in the back alley.
What's happening up front?

31:57.780 --> 32:00.010
All right, I got four men
out and counting.

32:02.750 --> 32:04.870
Looks like
kitchen staff, too.

32:05.070 --> 32:06.840
You got eyes on
Mateo or Reyna?

32:07.040 --> 32:08.670
McGEE: Clear outside. Torres?

32:08.870 --> 32:10.920
We got one more civilian.
Stand by.

32:13.490 --> 32:14.850
Torres, what's happening?

32:15.050 --> 32:16.610
Talk to me.

32:16.810 --> 32:18.850
Who are you?

32:19.050 --> 32:21.400
Talk to me, Nick.

32:30.010 --> 32:31.560
PARKER: Nick?

32:31.760 --> 32:32.860
You clear the place?

32:33.060 --> 32:35.470
(speaks Spanish)

32:35.670 --> 32:37.870
I know two of those words:
"Grandma" and "gun."

32:38.070 --> 32:39.240
Not a good combo.

32:39.440 --> 32:40.990
PARKER: Frank and I are going
in the back door.

32:42.820 --> 32:44.330
Stay still.

32:45.330 --> 32:47.310
Mateo. Come out.

32:47.510 --> 32:49.110
Yeah, Mateo.

32:49.310 --> 32:51.800
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

32:52.770 --> 32:53.580
NCIS.

32:53.780 --> 32:54.970
(screams)

33:04.080 --> 33:07.080
(grunting)

33:12.420 --> 33:13.690
FRANK:
Parker.

33:17.190 --> 33:19.130
(Reyna sobbing)

33:23.030 --> 33:24.530
We got Reyna.

33:25.330 --> 33:26.480
REYNA:
No!

33:26.680 --> 33:28.820
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

33:29.020 --> 33:30.120
I got you, I got you.

33:30.320 --> 33:32.060
I'm with NCIS.
I'm here to help.

33:32.260 --> 33:33.190
Everything's gonna be okay.

33:33.390 --> 33:34.360
Got you, got you.

33:34.560 --> 33:35.930
That's it, that's it.
(panting)

33:36.130 --> 33:37.830
You're okay.
Adam?

33:38.030 --> 33:40.930
He's fine.
Let's get you to him, okay?

33:41.130 --> 33:42.650
Here we go.

33:46.120 --> 33:48.160
(elevator bell dings)

33:52.330 --> 33:55.100
Mom? Mom!

33:58.930 --> 34:00.850
PARKER:
Ah, she's been
through the wringer.

34:01.050 --> 34:03.120
She couldn't wait
to get to her son.

34:03.320 --> 34:04.520
She's the real Wonder Woman.

34:04.720 --> 34:05.920
They're gonna need
protective custody.

34:06.120 --> 34:08.580
Mateo's brother's
still out there.

34:12.280 --> 34:14.010
What? What is it?

34:15.080 --> 34:18.620
Well, they killed Tanner,
but they let Reyna live?

34:20.020 --> 34:21.690
Why?

34:23.290 --> 34:24.330
Reyna?

34:25.190 --> 34:27.410
Would you mind
walking us through again

34:27.610 --> 34:29.850
what happened with
Tanner this morning?

34:30.050 --> 34:31.950
Uh...

34:32.150 --> 34:34.520
Daniel showed up
outside my building.

34:34.720 --> 34:37.590
He was bleeding,
barely conscious.

34:37.790 --> 34:40.690
And I was rushing him
to the hospital when we crashed.

34:40.890 --> 34:43.130
KNIGHT: Then the Serranos
took you from the hospital.

34:43.330 --> 34:44.960
What did Mateo want?

34:45.160 --> 34:46.700
That recording device.

34:46.900 --> 34:48.330
He kept asking where it was.

34:48.530 --> 34:49.870
The one that you planted
in his office.

34:50.070 --> 34:52.300
How did he know about it?
I don't know.

34:52.500 --> 34:55.270
I told him I didn't have it,
but he didn't believe me.

34:55.470 --> 34:56.710
Do you know what was on it?

34:56.910 --> 34:57.540
No, I...

34:57.740 --> 34:58.510
I gave it to Daniel,

34:58.710 --> 34:59.710
I never saw it again.

34:59.910 --> 35:01.350
Whatever was on that device

35:01.550 --> 35:02.810
was important to Serrano,
but we're never gonna hear it

35:03.010 --> 35:05.770
'cause it burned up
in the crash.

35:09.740 --> 35:11.570
But what if it didn't?

35:14.240 --> 35:16.360
MAN:
* 50 *

35:16.560 --> 35:19.130
* I got your 50 G *

35:19.330 --> 35:21.630
* 50... *

35:21.830 --> 35:24.000
Damn. Adam mixed this?

35:24.200 --> 35:26.100
We're talking about
the same goofy 11-year-old?

35:26.300 --> 35:28.570
Mozart was four
when he got started.

35:28.770 --> 35:30.540
You want to tell me
what we're looking for here?

35:30.740 --> 35:32.840
Agent Tanner would record
and bring audio clips

35:33.040 --> 35:34.380
for Adam to sample in his music.

35:34.580 --> 35:37.010
Our whiz kid would download
the clips onto his phone.

35:37.210 --> 35:39.480
And when Adam saw
this recording device,

35:39.680 --> 35:40.920
he thought that Tanner
brought it for him.

35:41.120 --> 35:43.050
So he copied the files on it...

35:43.250 --> 35:44.320
And used them in his mix.

35:44.520 --> 35:45.890
The mix we're
listening to right now?

35:46.090 --> 35:47.960
The device may have burned,
but thanks to Adam,

35:48.160 --> 35:50.730
we have pieces of the original
recording in his song.

35:50.930 --> 35:52.600
He's woven several
pieces together.

35:52.800 --> 35:54.470
Uh, got the bass.

35:54.670 --> 35:57.130
* *

35:57.330 --> 35:59.640
Beethoven's <i>Fifth Symphony</i>
for the melody.

35:59.840 --> 36:02.510
<i>(Fifth Symphony</i> plays)

36:02.710 --> 36:04.410
And here's the vocal track.

36:04.610 --> 36:05.780
MAN:
50.

36:05.980 --> 36:07.240
It'll be in Lincoln Park.

36:07.440 --> 36:08.610
KNIGHT:
Whose voice is that?

36:08.810 --> 36:09.910
Wait, there's more.

36:10.110 --> 36:11.920
I got your 50 G.

36:12.120 --> 36:14.970
(echoing):
It'll be in Lincoln Park.

36:16.240 --> 36:17.890
That's Serrano.
He's on the phone.

36:18.090 --> 36:21.010
According to the metadata,
this was recorded at...

36:22.080 --> 36:23.190
Mateo's Taqueria.

36:23.390 --> 36:24.600
Can you enhance it?

36:24.800 --> 36:27.200
Adam only used a piece.

36:27.400 --> 36:29.630
Here's the full clip
stitched back together.

36:29.830 --> 36:31.500
I got your 50 G.

36:31.700 --> 36:32.900
It'll be in Lincoln Park.

36:33.100 --> 36:35.710
Second bench from
the statue, 4:00 p.m.

36:35.910 --> 36:37.410
Just take care of Tanner.

36:37.610 --> 36:40.440
We find out who went
to Lincoln Park at 4:00 p.m....

36:40.640 --> 36:43.060
We know who killed Tanner.

36:47.230 --> 36:48.490
(elevator bell dings)

36:48.690 --> 36:50.240
FRANK:
Parker. Agent Knight.

36:51.040 --> 36:52.910
Just came to collect
Tanner's remains.

36:54.440 --> 36:56.230
I was going
to come up after,

36:56.430 --> 36:57.360
thank the whole team.

36:57.560 --> 36:58.960
Thought we'd save you the trip.

36:59.160 --> 37:00.600
We recovered
the murder weapon.

37:00.800 --> 37:01.870
Prints were wiped clean.

37:02.070 --> 37:03.780
But you already knew that.

37:04.650 --> 37:05.840
Come again?

37:06.040 --> 37:08.040
You planted that gun
in Mateo's office.

37:08.240 --> 37:10.820
Wanted us to believe
that he killed your partner.

37:12.760 --> 37:14.510
You work for the Serranos.

37:14.710 --> 37:18.420
I killed Mateo,
to save your ass no less.

37:18.620 --> 37:21.080
Why would I do that
if I was working for the cartel?

37:21.280 --> 37:22.950
Because you knew that
if we brought him in

37:23.150 --> 37:24.720
for questioning,
he'd rat you out.

37:24.920 --> 37:27.260
And he would tell us
that you killed Tanner.

37:27.460 --> 37:28.330
(laughs)

37:28.530 --> 37:30.310
You've all lost your minds.

37:32.010 --> 37:34.670
This is you in Lincoln Park
three days ago.

37:34.870 --> 37:36.770
Security cam caught you.

37:36.970 --> 37:39.670
It'll prove that you took
a bribe from Serrano.

37:39.870 --> 37:41.770
This? All this proves is
I like going to parks.

37:41.970 --> 37:43.570
You got me.
Yeah, you're right.

37:43.770 --> 37:45.080
On its own, the photo
means nothing.

37:45.280 --> 37:48.750
But the $50,000 in your bank
and the recording...

37:48.950 --> 37:50.010
sure gives it context.

37:50.210 --> 37:52.680
There is no recording.
It burned.

37:52.880 --> 37:54.030
Lucky for us...

37:54.940 --> 37:56.670
...we found a copy.

37:57.770 --> 37:58.820
MATEO:
It'll be in Lincoln Park.

37:59.020 --> 38:00.660
Second bench from the statue.

38:00.860 --> 38:02.660
Just take care of Tanner.

38:02.860 --> 38:04.850
That's Mateo Serrano.

38:06.480 --> 38:08.250
You know the drill.

38:13.020 --> 38:14.910
McGEE: Frank confessed
to working for the Serranos.

38:15.110 --> 38:16.270
And killing Tanner.

38:16.470 --> 38:17.640
He rolled over fast.

38:17.840 --> 38:18.940
He cut a deal with the D.A.

38:19.140 --> 38:21.010
to do, uh, his time,
uh, out of state.

38:21.210 --> 38:22.880
Yeah, he gave up
Isaac Serrano

38:23.080 --> 38:24.850
and other key players
in their operation.

38:25.050 --> 38:28.720
So, the eastern arm of
the Serrano cartel is no more.

38:28.920 --> 38:30.850
What happens with Adam
and his mom now?

38:31.050 --> 38:33.990
Well, Reyna's help was essential
in taking down the cartel.

38:34.190 --> 38:35.660
Customs and immigration

38:35.860 --> 38:38.600
are removing the block on her
naturalization application.

38:38.800 --> 38:41.260
They won't ever have to worry
about being separated.

38:41.470 --> 38:42.630
At least not until Adam

38:42.830 --> 38:44.130
goes away to Juilliard.

38:44.330 --> 38:46.020
Hey, there he is.

38:46.820 --> 38:48.250
(speaks indistinctly)

38:52.530 --> 38:56.180
I have so much to thank you for,
I don't know where to start.

38:56.380 --> 38:57.730
Just...

38:58.830 --> 39:00.120
Just keep him safe.

39:00.320 --> 39:02.370
She's not really
Wonder Woman, you know.

39:04.840 --> 39:06.690
Keep her safe.

39:06.890 --> 39:10.060
Don't worry, this team...

39:10.260 --> 39:12.110
we look out for each other.

39:15.680 --> 39:18.150
Adam. Let's go.

Thank you, Agent Knight.

39:27.630 --> 39:29.230
This is for you.

39:30.100 --> 39:32.300
Kasie helped me make it.

39:34.770 --> 39:36.470
Is this what I think it is?

39:42.880 --> 39:44.400
Let's go.

39:44.600 --> 39:45.980
Thank you.

39:51.020 --> 39:52.300
Y'all hear that?

39:52.500 --> 39:54.150
Hear what?

39:55.420 --> 39:56.470
Nothing.

39:56.670 --> 39:59.040
There are no more
phones ringing.

39:59.240 --> 40:01.080
Does that mean
your 15 minutes are up?

40:01.280 --> 40:04.260
Wonder Woman sure hopes so.
