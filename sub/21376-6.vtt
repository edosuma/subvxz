he's our L. Ron Hubbard.

- Yeah.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.242

{\an8}My obsession with MJ
is out of control.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.438
I own 60 pairs of Jordans.
I once bought the DVD

08:42.520 --> 08:44.315
to the movie "Creed"
just because I was confused

08:44.398 --> 08:45.608

08:45.691 --> 08:47.443
[laughter]

08:47.526 --> 08:49.779

so I went to a psychiatrist

08:49.862 --> 08:51.489

08:51.572 --> 08:52.573
{\an3}I'm not really here

with Michael Jordan.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.957

what does that mean?

09:01.040 --> 09:03.125

from where I come from

09:03.209 --> 09:05.628

09:05.711 --> 09:10.800
- Mm-hmm.
- I want every single pair

09:10.883 --> 09:13.761
{\an3}of Michael Jordan shoes,
or Air Jordans.

09:13.844 --> 09:16.472
{\an3}Now, there's Jumpman Jordans
which are Team Jordans--

09:16.555 --> 09:17.682
I don't really care about those.
- Right.

09:17.765 --> 09:20.351
{\an3}- I'm reading a book
about Michael Jordan's life

09:20.434 --> 09:23.145
{\an3}right now, and I'm reading it
like Proverbs.

09:23.229 --> 09:27.108
{\an1}- It's great to be a fan,
but when it starts to interfere

09:27.191 --> 09:29.819
{\an1}with your social
and occupational functioning...

09:29.902 --> 09:31.153
- Mm-hmm.
- Then it becomes

09:31.237 --> 09:32.989
a little bit dangerous.

09:33.072 --> 09:36.284
{\an1}Even the people we do admire,
or are fans of,

09:36.367 --> 09:37.910
aren't perfect people.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.662
{\an3}- So what you're saying is
I can still like

09:39.745 --> 09:44.625

and not go pee on children?

09:44.709 --> 09:46.419

- Can we do a role play?
- Sure.

09:53.467 --> 09:55.511
{\an3}- Like, as if
I'm Michael Jordan?

09:55.594 --> 09:57.513
- Okay.
- I'm at the center

09:57.596 --> 10:00.433
{\an3}of urban fashion, but people
people say that I dress

10:00.516 --> 10:02.685

10:02.768 --> 10:04.270
{\an1}- Do you enjoy wearing
those clothes?

10:04.353 --> 10:06.022

in the streets

and some baggy jeans.

10:07.648 --> 10:09.317
{\an7}- Do you think you look good
like that?

10:09.400 --> 10:11.193
- Whatever I wear
is fashionable--

10:11.277 --> 10:13.529
even this Hitler mustache.
- What's going on

10:13.612 --> 10:16.032
with the Hitler mustache?
- At some point,

10:16.115 --> 10:18.993
I just wanted to wear
my mustache

10:19.076 --> 10:20.786
with the edges missing.
- Uh-huh.

10:20.870 --> 10:23.039
- Is it subconscious?
Do I feel like

10:23.122 --> 10:24.540
I'm the Hitler of basketball?

10:24.623 --> 10:27.126
{\an1}- Do you think that
there is a connection

10:27.209 --> 10:30.338
between you and Hitler?
- I'll be honest, yes.

10:30.421 --> 10:32.840
{\an3}'Cause when I'm in the NBA,
I'm killin' at these [BLEEP].

10:32.923 --> 10:35.384

All-Star Weekend is

10:51.484 --> 10:53.361

10:53.444 --> 10:55.279
Freaknik,
Barack's inauguration,

10:55.363 --> 10:57.740

"Straight Outta Compton."
