00:00.167 --> 00:02.127
[Mac] Previously on
Commander in Chief:

00:02.211 --> 00:05.714
- Like to introduce Richard McDonald.
- Dickie, what are you doing here?

00:05.797 --> 00:08.007
Nice to see they're
keeping you in the loop.

00:08.090 --> 00:10.511
You let me know
when you bring someone new.

00:10.594 --> 00:12.638
You're right. I'm sorry.

00:12.721 --> 00:16.099
- You going to run for re-election?
- I hadn't really thought about it.

00:16.183 --> 00:19.686
You don't start running today, you're
a lame duck for the next two years.

00:19.770 --> 00:23.357
You should close up the Connecticut
house and move in here with us.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.567
Be careful. I just might accept.

00:25.651 --> 00:27.611
No Mike! I...

00:27.694 --> 00:30.864
...um, I just...

00:30.948 --> 00:32.991
I'm sorry. I just can't.

00:33.075 --> 00:34.451
What's up with him?

00:34.535 --> 00:37.913
- About your sister.
- Did he say something?

00:37.996 --> 00:40.249
- Horace! Stop!
- Flemming, I wanna talk to you!

00:40.332 --> 00:42.543
Keep your mouth shut.
How hard is that?

00:42.626 --> 00:43.919
I tried but... you know.

00:44.002 --> 00:45.921
Sometimes a guy's just gotta share.

00:46.004 --> 00:47.881
I did the president's daughter!

00:47.965 --> 00:49.424
People make mistakes.

00:49.508 --> 00:52.844
You know what they say.
It's a contact sport. Wear a cup.

00:52.928 --> 00:56.473
You may want to put on a cup for this.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.017
She just ambushed me
in the Oval Office.

00:59.101 --> 01:01.270
She knew I had the story
of her gay assistant.

01:01.353 --> 01:04.647
- And she knew how I got it.
- You'll have other opportunities.

01:04.730 --> 01:07.693
No. I don't want to hear your excuses.
Just get out of here.

01:07.776 --> 01:11.238
- I shouldn't have fired Jayne.
- Jayne was an excellent chief of staff.

01:11.321 --> 01:16.076
- You won't find any better.
- Well, I can't hire her back.

01:16.159 --> 01:18.453
Why not?

01:18.537 --> 01:20.330
Because I'd have to beg.

01:20.414 --> 01:24.585
[chuckling] It's just a tactic,
sweetheart.

01:41.852 --> 01:47.733
- They also serve who only sit and wait.
- Nathan.

01:47.816 --> 01:51.028
- You're up early.
- May I?

01:51.111 --> 01:52.613
I'm expecting someone.

01:52.696 --> 01:55.907
He's always late... Alex Tucci.

01:55.991 --> 01:59.328
You're going to try and persuade
the good senator from Arizona

01:59.411 --> 02:00.954
to allow more what?

02:01.038 --> 02:04.833
- Navajo casinos in his state?
- Apache casinos, actually.

02:04.916 --> 02:07.586
Lobbying becomes you.

02:07.669 --> 02:10.964
Word has it that
the clients are just pouring in.

02:11.048 --> 02:14.176
- It's going well.
- I would expect nothing less.

02:14.259 --> 02:17.095
- You're top-notch.
- Thank you.

02:18.513 --> 02:20.015
How are things at the office?

02:20.098 --> 02:21.892
[grunting, inhaling deeply]

02:21.975 --> 02:25.646
It's not easy finding
someone to fill your shoes.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.858
Well, I hear you're
talking to Jim Carrigan.

02:29.941 --> 02:32.152
- He's good.
- Give me a break.

02:32.986 --> 02:36.573
Jim Carrigan in your
shoes lacks a certain...

02:36.657 --> 02:37.866
...something.

02:37.949 --> 02:41.953
- Well, I'm sure you'll find someone.
- What about you?

02:42.037 --> 02:44.081
What do you think
about you coming back?

02:46.833 --> 02:50.087
- Why the change of heart?
- It's not a change of heart.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.630
My heart never changed.

02:51.713 --> 02:55.342
It broke a little and
it's back together now.

02:55.425 --> 02:58.011
We're a good team.
Real good.

02:58.845 --> 03:01.932
I don't remember you saying anything
like that when you fired me.

03:02.015 --> 03:05.811
I was intemperate and...
I regret that.

03:05.894 --> 03:08.438
You hurt me, Nathan.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.232
I hurt you?

03:11.316 --> 03:14.111
You betrayed me, Jayne.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.909
I'm sorry, Mr. Speaker.

03:20.992 --> 03:23.912
- I like what I'm doing.
- Yeah. Of course you do.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.959
Senator Tucci's here.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.461
It's a tricky business.
This casino stuff, Jayne.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.046
So watch your back, okay?

03:35.090 --> 03:36.383
Thank you.

03:37.342 --> 03:39.928
It's "if" I run.
No decision's been made.

03:40.011 --> 03:43.306
I've been thinking it over and
wanted to talk about it with all of you.

03:43.390 --> 03:46.017
And we know a campaign
won't be easy on anyone.

03:46.101 --> 03:48.603
It means more travel
for Mom and me.

03:48.687 --> 03:51.022
- Even less family time.
- Do you think you can win?

03:51.106 --> 03:53.567
- The first question is, "Do I run?"
- Of course you do.

03:53.650 --> 03:57.362
You're not going to settle for two years
of borrowed presidency, are you?

03:57.446 --> 03:59.906
- I say go for it.
- You mean that, Horace?

03:59.990 --> 04:00.991
Yeah. Absolutely.

04:01.074 --> 04:04.411
Can I stay up and watch the
election returns this time?

04:05.120 --> 04:08.039
- Yes, you can.
- Then I think you should do it.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.876
Becca?

04:10.959 --> 04:12.627
Does it matter what I think?

04:12.711 --> 04:15.505
It's a family discussion.
Matters what everyone thinks.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.466
So does that mean if I say no,
you won't run?

04:18.550 --> 04:21.094
It means that everyone gets a say.

04:21.178 --> 04:24.055
So then it doesn't
really matter what I think.

04:24.139 --> 04:26.558
If you don't want to be
part of a campaign, fine.

04:26.641 --> 04:30.145
- You don't have to do anything.
- I'm a part whether I wanna be or not.

04:30.228 --> 04:32.689
You think I'll be left alone
just because you say so?

04:32.773 --> 04:35.275
We'll talk to the press.
We'll control the media.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.819
And the tabloids and
talk radio and the net?

04:37.903 --> 04:42.032
Remember when bloggers claimed
Tommy wasn't President Bridges's son?

04:42.115 --> 04:45.035
That was a lie.
Nobody believed that.

04:45.118 --> 04:48.747
- There are people who believe that.
- Come on, Bec. It's not like that.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.625
In an election they can say
whatever they want about us.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.752
You think people care if it's the truth?

04:53.835 --> 04:55.712
Becca...

04:55.796 --> 04:58.340
Mom, do whatever you want, okay?

04:58.423 --> 05:01.885
Just don't pretend
you care about my opinion.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.722
Becca's first reaction
is always to strike back.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.933
- Then she comes around.
- She's right.

05:08.016 --> 05:11.561
If I run, it'll get ugly. Templeton
will see to that, if no one else does.

05:11.645 --> 05:14.022
- We can handle it.
- It won't be like last time.

05:14.105 --> 05:17.734
The president's family takes much more
heat than the vice president's.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.486
We're tougher than you think.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.154
Morning, everyone.

05:21.238 --> 05:23.281
- Madam President.
- Thank you for coming.

05:23.365 --> 05:24.741
- Dickie.
- Rod.

05:24.825 --> 05:27.869
Well, I love the smell
of a new campaign in the morning.

05:27.953 --> 05:29.955
We're not running yet.
Just talking.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.332
Well, so what do you think?
Can we pull it off?

05:32.415 --> 05:35.669
Like to start by assessing a
candidate's strengths and weaknesses.

05:35.752 --> 05:39.130
I've put together a list of
all the assets we have on hand

05:39.214 --> 05:41.591
to win the election.

05:46.471 --> 05:49.724
None. We have nothing.

05:49.808 --> 05:54.020
We have no states we know we can win.
No electoral votes we can count on.

05:54.104 --> 05:57.440
No party to support us.
No endorsements. No money.

05:57.524 --> 06:00.151
She's a sitting president.
A significant asset.

06:00.235 --> 06:01.736
We're on TV every day.

06:01.820 --> 06:04.364
We have the front page
of the papers any time we want.

06:04.447 --> 06:07.492
Well, last time I checked,
our poll numbers weren't so bad.

06:07.576 --> 06:10.954
Your likeability and trustworthiness
numbers are through the roof.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.665
Majority of Americans
think you're a good person.

06:13.748 --> 06:18.169
They also think you're president by
accident. That doesn't bring in votes.

06:18.253 --> 06:20.964
Now, I polled a hypothetical election.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.508
You against Templeton
and an unnamed Democrat.

06:23.592 --> 06:25.135
If that race were held today...

06:25.218 --> 06:26.761
...you'd come in third.

06:26.845 --> 06:29.431
We lost to someone with no name?

06:29.514 --> 06:33.101
Dickie, this is starting to sound like
a meeting to convince Mac not to run.

06:33.184 --> 06:35.854
If you run, you can win.

06:35.937 --> 06:38.273
But you have to
define yourself for the people.

06:38.356 --> 06:41.234
Show them why you're not just
Teddy Bridges's replacement.

06:41.318 --> 06:45.196
Excuse me. Madam President, the National
Security Advisor has asked to see you.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.741
Thank you.
You'll have to excuse us.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.285
I'll stick around in case
your day opens up later.

06:50.368 --> 06:51.453
Don't bet on it.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.045
What is it, Tony?

07:00.128 --> 07:03.965
Ma'am, we've received word
that one of our subs is in trouble.

07:04.049 --> 07:07.677
It's the Seattle.
An Ohio class SSGN. Crew of 155.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.847
- We think it struck something.
- What's the damage? Casualties?

07:10.931 --> 07:14.976
Don't know. Communication's difficult.
I'm afraid it gets worse.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.771
She's off the coast of North Korea.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.608
How far off the coast?

07:21.691 --> 07:26.529
Fifteen miles from the city of Chongjin.
That's why the comm's so bad.

07:26.613 --> 07:31.159
They're transmitting on low frequency
so the North Koreans won't intercept.

07:31.242 --> 07:34.120
Fifteen miles...
That's practically inside their waters.

07:34.204 --> 07:37.832
Yes. Fortunately, right now, it looks
like they have no idea we're there.

07:37.916 --> 07:40.210
CIA says there's nothing
on North Korean media.

07:40.293 --> 07:43.088
NSA reports no increase
in chatter on military channels.

07:43.171 --> 07:46.758
- They find out, they'll throw a fit.
- [Mac] They'll throw worse than that.

07:46.841 --> 07:49.552
We had operations in that area?
What is it doing there?

07:49.636 --> 07:52.681
I don't know. This is the first
I've heard she was in the region.

07:52.764 --> 07:55.767
The Joint Chiefs and the
secretary of defense are on their way.

07:55.850 --> 07:58.019
How long can the men last?

07:58.103 --> 08:02.065
At this point we estimate
96 hours, at most.

08:20.542 --> 08:24.421
[bell ringing]

08:31.219 --> 08:32.761
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.889
Way to throw Mom a little support, Bec.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.975
Why is it always about
us supporting her?

08:37.058 --> 08:40.311
- I mean, how about her supporting us?
- She's supported us plenty.

08:40.395 --> 08:42.897
- Lately?
- She's been busy.

08:42.981 --> 08:44.441
My point exactly.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.651
I'm not saying
it's gonna be easy if she runs.

08:46.735 --> 08:50.071
Look, I don't like the campaigning
any more than you do.

08:50.155 --> 08:52.532
Liar. All that attention.
Come on, you love it.

08:52.615 --> 08:57.412
You don't have anyone on the high
dive saying "I did the president's son."

08:57.495 --> 09:01.166
- Flemming is a jerk.
- It's not about him, okay?

09:01.249 --> 09:03.543
It's about... having some privacy.

09:03.626 --> 09:07.255
Bec, Mom has got a chance to do
something really extraordinary.

09:07.338 --> 09:09.466
We should be there for her.

09:09.549 --> 09:13.011
You just don't get it, Horace.

09:13.094 --> 09:15.138
I mean, it's not just the election.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.182
This could be ten years of our lives.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.641
I mean, think about it.

09:18.725 --> 09:21.144
Every girl you date,
every test you fail,

09:21.227 --> 09:24.272
every time you screw up...
It's public property.

09:24.355 --> 09:26.983
And God forbid
you get your hands on a bong

09:27.067 --> 09:29.986
and someone's got
a digital camera in the room.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.822
'Cause ten minutes later
you'll be on the Internet.

09:32.906 --> 09:36.826
I'm just saying I want my life
to be my life.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.496
Is that so much to ask for?

09:47.921 --> 09:50.298
- Ten-hut!
- Everyone.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.050
[door closing]

09:55.512 --> 09:58.640
Please be seated.
General Krieger, what do we know?

09:58.723 --> 10:02.685
At 04:50 the Seattle struck a seamount
14 miles off the coast of North Korea.

10:02.769 --> 10:06.356
- How? Isn't it on the charts?
- We checked against satellite imagery.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.484
The mountain's charted
location is off by almost 1200 yards.

10:09.567 --> 10:11.111
How bad is the damage?

10:11.194 --> 10:13.530
The starboard forward section
was breached.

10:13.613 --> 10:17.033
They were able to seal off the
compartments aft of the collision point,

10:17.117 --> 10:18.701
but there are cracks in the hull.

10:18.785 --> 10:22.664
Which means there is flooding in some
compartments throughout the boat.

10:22.747 --> 10:25.834
They have power, but they've lost
propulsion. They can't move.

10:25.917 --> 10:28.837
And where's the sub in relation
to the 12 mile limit?

10:28.920 --> 10:34.134
After the collision, it drifted. It's on
the ocean floor just inside the limit.

10:34.217 --> 10:38.346
The crew was able to seal itself off
in the aft compartments, here.

10:38.429 --> 10:43.101
They're reporting 24 injured.
No fatalities. Yet.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.477
What's our rescue plan?

10:44.561 --> 10:48.648
We're still putting one together.
Obviously, the location is a problem.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.656
- What's the captain's name?
- Andrew Duggan.

10:56.739 --> 10:59.909
- Do we have communication with him?
- We're working on it.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.453
All right. Let me know when you do.

11:02.537 --> 11:06.332
General Krieger, Secretary Frances,
Director Shoop. A minute.

11:08.543 --> 11:11.546
- [telephone ringing]
- [indistinct chatter]

11:16.050 --> 11:19.804
What was one of our submarines
doing that close to North Korea?

11:20.722 --> 11:24.434
Ma'am, the Seattle was on a covert
intelligence mission monitoring the

11:24.517 --> 11:27.937
possible sale of nuclear material from
North Korea to the black market.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.607
A spy mission?
First I've heard about it.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.318
- Who authorized it?
- [Frances] President Bridges.

11:33.401 --> 11:36.529
- Shortly before his death.
- And why wasn't I told?

11:36.613 --> 11:40.074
When President Bridges died,
it had not been ordered to North Korea.

11:40.158 --> 11:43.286
- There was no mission to inform you.
- He just said there was.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.997
- One of you is lying.
- The mission had been approved.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.916
Operational orders hadn't gone out.

11:47.999 --> 11:50.376
[Frances] We've got
assets on the move every day.

11:50.460 --> 11:53.880
If we told you every tank we moved,
we wouldn't have time to do anything.

11:54.797 --> 11:57.800
This is not a tank, Mr. Secretary.
This is a submarine

11:57.884 --> 12:02.805
the size of two football fields
armed with a 154 cruise missiles.

12:02.889 --> 12:06.059
The next time you want to put one
in the waters of a hostile nation

12:06.142 --> 12:10.730
that might have nuclear weapons aimed
at San Francisco. I wanna know about it.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.108
Is that clear?

12:16.694 --> 12:17.820
Noted.

12:19.781 --> 12:23.409
Let me know as soon as you have
voice contact with the sub.

12:25.411 --> 12:28.873
Why did they keep this a secret? Does
the military distrust me that much?

12:28.957 --> 12:30.500
[Rod] Of course. At budget time,

12:30.583 --> 12:33.711
Bridges gave the Pentagon
everything they asked for. You won't.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.838
You're a civilian.
Never been in uniform.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.924
- That's not supposed to matter.
- It does.

12:38.007 --> 12:41.135
- They'll learn to trust you.
- The question is, can we trust them?

12:41.219 --> 12:44.722
We're not talking coup d'etat.
This mission had Presidential approval.

12:44.806 --> 12:47.350
- Not this President's approval.
- That was wrong.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.644
But... honestly, ma'am.

12:49.727 --> 12:52.814
If they had come to you,
would you have said no?

12:52.897 --> 12:56.025
If North Koreans are moving
nuclear material, we want to know.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.987
The point is, they didn't ask.
Did you know about this?

12:59.070 --> 13:01.406
No. Bridges was close
to Krieger and Frances.

13:01.489 --> 13:04.367
- They met without me all the time.
- Really?

13:04.450 --> 13:07.203
- Are you insinuating something?
- I'm just wondering.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.957
No time for this, guys. Look, is the
secretary of state in Bangalore yet?

13:11.040 --> 13:14.085
- Arrived about an hour ago.
- Brief him, but tell him to stay put.

13:14.168 --> 13:16.379
If he cuts his trip short
it raises questions.

13:16.462 --> 13:19.674
Maybe we want the vice president here.
He knows the military.

13:19.757 --> 13:20.967
- I trust him.
- I'll call.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.844
- Good.
- The Joint Chiefs are ready.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.221
I wanna meet in
the Cabinet, not the Sit Room.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.558
Any particular reason?
The Sit Room's better equipped for this.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.227
We can move equipment
to the Cabinet Room if we need to?

13:31.311 --> 13:33.354
- Of course.
- That's where we're meeting.

13:33.438 --> 13:35.857
- All right.
- The Sit Room is their tree house.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.483
I want to meet on my own ground.

13:42.947 --> 13:43.906
- Rod!
- Mmm?

13:43.990 --> 13:46.701
That's the last time you
question my loyalty or honesty

13:46.784 --> 13:48.786
- in front of the president.
- Just asking.

13:48.870 --> 13:52.415
We've enough trouble getting the
military and president on the same page

13:52.498 --> 13:55.918
without selling her some conspiracy
about generals plotting a coup.

13:56.002 --> 13:59.130
- Think the military's against her?
- I think they don't know her.

13:59.213 --> 14:01.591
Treat them like the enemy,
they become the enemy.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.886
Well, maybe they are. The Chiefs.
The secretary of defense.

14:04.969 --> 14:08.473
They're Bridges' people.
I don't trust 'em worth a damn.

14:08.556 --> 14:13.311
Oh, and by the way, I'll sell my wife
on any conspiracy theory I like.

14:24.697 --> 14:27.533
Unusual setting, ma'am.

14:27.617 --> 14:29.827
It's an unusual problem.
What's your plan?

14:29.911 --> 14:34.332
Ma'am, we're going to use a Pressurized
Rescue Module System. PRMS.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.292
It allows us to extract the crew

14:36.376 --> 14:39.545
and remove them to a site
outside the 12 mile limit.

14:39.629 --> 14:41.381
Then return in a couple of months.

14:41.464 --> 14:43.633
- Tow the sub out.
- The Koreans won't know?

14:43.716 --> 14:45.259
No. There is one catch.

14:45.343 --> 14:48.930
The PRMS has to be tethered to
a ship outside the 12 mile limit.

14:49.013 --> 14:51.808
Obviously, it can't be American.
That would be a red flag.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.352
- How about a Japanese ship?
- The same as one of ours.

14:54.435 --> 14:56.604
What kind of ship
did you have in mind?

14:56.687 --> 15:00.441
The Chinese have oceanographic research
vessels that work around the limit.

15:00.525 --> 15:02.777
- The Chinese?
- North Koreans won't look twice

15:02.860 --> 15:04.695
at a Chinese ship,
Mr. Vice President.

15:04.779 --> 15:07.990
Let me get this straight. You want me
to ask the Chinese government

15:08.074 --> 15:10.493
to rescue an American crew
in Korean waters?

15:10.576 --> 15:13.579
If you want to save the lives
of the Seattle's crew...

15:13.663 --> 15:15.164
- ...yes.
- We can't do that.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.625
The sub is there.
What other choice do we have?

15:17.708 --> 15:21.504
It'd be an intelligence catastrophe if
that sub fell into North Korean hands.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.798
Or Chinese hands, for that matter.

15:23.881 --> 15:26.884
It'll endanger the lives
of every sub crew in the water.

15:26.968 --> 15:30.054
We have to assume the North Koreans
have nuclear weapons.

15:30.138 --> 15:33.683
If they have them, they'll use them.
It's not a rational state, ma'am.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.978
It's the international equivalent
of a paranoid schizophrenic.

15:37.061 --> 15:39.397
If they find out we've got
a sub in their water,

15:39.480 --> 15:42.859
we could be looking at
mushroom clouds in 15 minutes.

15:44.527 --> 15:47.864
Ma'am, there is no one who wants
those men home more than I do.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.949
No one.

15:50.032 --> 15:53.703
But they were briefed on the mission...
and they understood the risks.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.580
You're saying, "don't rescue them."

15:55.663 --> 15:59.625
Ma'am, it repels me
to even to suggest that.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.796
But that may be our only option.

16:07.091 --> 16:08.718
I'm not ready to consider it.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.554
Ma'am, if you don't want
to work with the Chinese.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.389
You don't want to abandon the sub...

16:15.141 --> 16:16.476
What do you want to do?

16:23.149 --> 16:25.234
Let's contact the Chinese.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.572
Templeton knows
the Chinese ambassador.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.616
Golf buddies.
He might be able to help.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.743
Templeton? I don't trust Templeton.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.579
Neither do I. But... if he can help,
I want him here.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.372
I'll make the call.

16:38.456 --> 16:41.959
Excuse me. The state's attorney's
general. They're waiting in the OEOB.

16:42.043 --> 16:44.378
Do you want to skip that?
I could make an excuse.

16:44.462 --> 16:47.548
Start changing the schedule,
people will know something's up.

16:47.632 --> 16:49.509
For now we keep up appearances.

16:51.636 --> 16:53.221
[indistinct chatter]

16:56.849 --> 16:58.184
Ma'am.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.813
- You up on North Korea?
- Why? Should I be?

17:02.897 --> 17:05.483
- It's on the radar.
- How would you know?

17:08.236 --> 17:10.320
Prado calls the president
in for a meeting.

17:10.404 --> 17:13.741
President goes down to the Sit Room.
Huddles in the Oval with Keaton.

17:13.824 --> 17:15.284
Then goes to the Cabinet Room.

17:15.367 --> 17:18.704
Meets with Frances, Krieger, Shoop,
and a whole mess of Navy boys.

17:18.788 --> 17:22.083
Including not one, not two,
but three East Asia experts.

17:22.165 --> 17:25.461
A couple of countries in that part of
the world could rattle our cage.

17:25.545 --> 17:28.506
- My money says North Korea.
- You're making this up.

17:28.589 --> 17:31.259
Foreign policy crisis
can be big for a press secretary.

17:31.342 --> 17:33.886
- Right.
- Capital is Pyongyang.

17:33.970 --> 17:35.638
Don't say I didn't warn you.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.892
[phone ringing]

17:42.937 --> 17:44.814
What are you still doing here, Dickie?

17:44.897 --> 17:46.649
I'm here to help you out.

17:46.732 --> 17:49.026
- With what?
- Your Korean problem.

17:49.110 --> 17:51.988
I don't claim
national security expertise.

17:52.071 --> 17:55.449
The last place I should be is in
the Cabinet Room with the generals.

17:55.533 --> 17:58.911
But... if this is even half as big
as I think it is,

17:58.995 --> 18:01.497
it's gonna be a pivotal moment
for the president.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.917
Once decisions are made, you need
someone to help shape the message.

18:07.253 --> 18:10.590
Listen to me, Dickie.
There is no Korean problem.

18:10.673 --> 18:13.134
There are no generals
in the Cabinet Room.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.219
And there is not
going to be a message.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.472
Whatever it is, I hope you're right.

18:18.556 --> 18:21.434
You brought me here
to help protect the president's flank.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.769
I have a hunch she
might need some protecting.

18:24.895 --> 18:26.355
Well, let's hope not.

18:26.439 --> 18:30.443
But... if she does...
We'll call you.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.194
Rod.

18:34.155 --> 18:36.991
- I just want to help.
- I know.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.787
- [phones ringing]
- [indistinct chatter]

18:46.208 --> 18:48.294
Mr. Speaker. Thank you for coming.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.713
The game's afoot.
Let's get those people home.

18:50.796 --> 18:53.841
- Think the Chinese'll help?
- It's an unprecedented request.

18:53.924 --> 18:57.762
They're going to ask for a lot.
But the ambassador's a friend of mine.

18:57.845 --> 19:00.681
I've been giving him mulligans
for the past ten years.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.642
I'm confident we can make a deal.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.226
- Good.
- [Keaton] Problem.

19:04.310 --> 19:07.772
The Seattle's reporting that
the scrubbers are contaminated.

19:07.855 --> 19:11.776
- How extensive is the damage?
- They estimate 10% capacity left.

19:11.859 --> 19:15.571
Scrubbers do what?
They take oxygen from seawater, right?

19:15.655 --> 19:17.698
How long do they think
the system can last?

19:17.782 --> 19:19.950
Forty to 48 hours.

19:20.034 --> 19:23.663
Can we get the rescue vehicle
down to them before then?

19:23.746 --> 19:26.040
- There's not a chance.
- [door opening]

19:27.541 --> 19:30.336
Ma'am? The sub's was able
to get a buoy to the surface.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.464
We have communication
with the captain for a few minutes.

19:33.547 --> 19:38.511
[radio static, male voice] The hull is
still holding with even pressure.

19:38.594 --> 19:40.554
We're at 39 centimeters.

19:40.638 --> 19:43.432
Captain Duggan, this is the president.
Can you hear me?

19:43.516 --> 19:47.269
Yes, ma'am, I can hear you. It's coming
in and out, but I can hear you.

19:47.353 --> 19:50.606
It's good to hear your voice.
How is your crew?

19:50.690 --> 19:54.443
All present and accounted for.
We're hanging in there.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.571
A little banged up here.
Managing to hold our own.

19:57.655 --> 20:00.950
Good. We're doing everything
we can to get you and your men out

20:01.033 --> 20:03.744
as soon as possible.

20:03.828 --> 20:06.956
- [feedback, static]
- Captain?

20:07.039 --> 20:09.083
Captain Duggan,
can you hear me?

20:26.392 --> 20:29.645
Is there any way to get a rescue vehicle
down to the sub in time?

20:29.729 --> 20:32.732
Ma'am, the problem is half the
equipment's in Guam for repair.

20:32.815 --> 20:34.859
- The other half...
- Yes or no, admiral.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.777
No.

20:36.861 --> 20:40.114
Madam President,
I'm afraid at this point

20:40.197 --> 20:43.284
we have to consider
abandoning the Seattle.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.746
A rescue's impossible.

20:46.829 --> 20:49.039
Our paramount responsibility

20:49.123 --> 20:52.293
is keeping the North Koreans
from learning about the sub.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.920
Best way to do that
is stay as far away as we can.

20:56.297 --> 20:59.216
Ma'am, if the North Koreans
find out where the Seattle is,

20:59.300 --> 21:01.886
we could be dealing with
a nuclear confrontation.

21:01.969 --> 21:03.929
We can't afford to take that risk.

21:05.890 --> 21:08.267
I think the Chinese have...

21:08.350 --> 21:12.772
Admiral, don't the Chinese have a deep
sea rescue system similar to the PRMS?

21:12.855 --> 21:14.148
They do.

21:15.357 --> 21:19.028
- Could we use their system?
- In theory.

21:19.111 --> 21:22.281
Borrow a Chinese rescue vehicle?

21:22.364 --> 21:24.200
They'd never go for it.

21:24.283 --> 21:27.077
Why not?
We're asking them to borrow a boat.

21:27.161 --> 21:30.873
Even if they loaned it, there's not time
to train Americans pilots to run it.

21:30.956 --> 21:33.125
What if the Chinese provided the pilots?

21:33.209 --> 21:35.419
Ma'am, a Chinese crew inside the Seattle

21:35.503 --> 21:38.005
would be an unacceptable
intelligence breach.

21:43.177 --> 21:46.680
Would a Chinese pilot
have to enter the Seattle?

21:46.764 --> 21:49.475
What if we sent an American crew
down in the Chinese ship?

21:49.558 --> 21:52.144
The Chinese would never
have to leave their vehicle.

21:53.729 --> 21:55.731
If the Chinese went along...

21:59.443 --> 22:01.654
You think we can get
the Chinese to make a deal?

22:01.737 --> 22:04.949
We can always make a deal.
It's just a question of price.

22:05.032 --> 22:07.660
How long before
the ambassador gets here?

22:07.743 --> 22:09.411
Hour. He's on his way from New York.

22:09.495 --> 22:12.456
- Let me know as soon as he gets here.
- Yes, ma'am.

22:18.003 --> 22:20.464
What are the Chinese
going to want to make this deal?

22:20.548 --> 22:22.925
Weapons. I mean, not from us directly.

22:23.008 --> 22:27.263
But they've been trying to buy high-tech
weapons parts from the European Union.

22:27.346 --> 22:30.432
We've been blocking it.
They'll ask you to look the other way.

22:30.516 --> 22:33.018
- I can't agree to that.
- Good. I mean, right. Right.

22:33.102 --> 22:36.605
Bring their military up to speed.
Run the risk of cutting your own throat.

22:36.689 --> 22:39.400
How do I keep that off
the table and still make a deal?

22:40.693 --> 22:45.656
[inhaling] Well, you start by offering
them to cut tariffs on steel, textiles.

22:45.739 --> 22:47.950
Dial back the rhetoric on human rights.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.785
- Is that going to do it?
- No.

22:49.869 --> 22:53.455
We're asking for a lot.
They're going to want a lot.

22:53.539 --> 22:55.624
I just don't know
what else we have to give.

22:55.708 --> 22:59.378
If you don't want them to buy weapons,
how about letting them sell weapons?

22:59.461 --> 23:03.132
I mean, the Chinese have been trying
to export arms to Algeria and Myanmar.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.217
- We've stood in the way.
- Hmm.

23:05.301 --> 23:09.096
You could sure get their attention if
you offered to turn a blind eye to that.

23:09.179 --> 23:13.058
Hmm. Putting more weapons into
the Third World? I'd rather not.

23:13.142 --> 23:15.978
It's not what you want.
It's what you can't.

23:16.061 --> 23:20.691
The bottom line is, they're not going
to ask for something you want to give.

23:20.774 --> 23:22.318
Hmm.

23:24.194 --> 23:26.864
- [telephones ringing]
- [indistinct chatter]

23:29.241 --> 23:33.203
Ninety minutes. We're waiting
90 minutes for this guy.

23:33.287 --> 23:36.248
Mr. McIntyre. It's the White House.
They get busy.

23:36.332 --> 23:38.417
I'm busy.
I got here at three on the dot.

23:38.500 --> 23:41.086
[sighing heavily] It's Gardner himself

23:41.170 --> 23:43.505
- that we're meeting with, right?
- That's right.

23:43.589 --> 23:46.133
I don't want to be
staffed out to the assistant.

23:46.216 --> 23:48.177
Jim has the president's ear, OK?

23:48.260 --> 23:51.639
Talking to him is as good as
talking to the president herself.

23:51.722 --> 23:54.892
Oh, here he is.
Jim, this is Andrew McIntyre.

23:54.975 --> 23:58.103
He's vice president of the
Automobile Retailers Consortium.

23:58.187 --> 24:00.522
Mr. McIntyre, I'm sorry.
We can't meet today.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.942
- What?
- We have an appointment.

24:03.025 --> 24:06.654
I do apologize. Check with me next week.
I'll give you plenty of time.

24:06.737 --> 24:07.988
- Jim...
- I'm sorry.

24:08.072 --> 24:10.616
Mr. McIntyre, again, my apologies.

24:12.326 --> 24:13.702
What the hell was that?

24:13.786 --> 24:16.705
- Obviously, there's some problem.
- Oh yeah, there sure is.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.332
I flew in from Saginaw for this?

24:18.415 --> 24:21.126
- I'll get you another meeting.
- Aw, the hell you will.

24:21.210 --> 24:23.045
We're paying your firm
$20,000 a month

24:23.128 --> 24:25.297
for face time with
senior White House staff.

24:25.381 --> 24:28.801
That's what you deliver. That's
what I expect. Get me that meeting.

24:28.884 --> 24:31.929
Hey. A little respect
when you speak to the lady.

24:32.012 --> 24:35.641
- Who are you?
- Her fiancÃ©.

24:41.063 --> 24:44.024
You tell your boss
you just lost him an account.

24:48.570 --> 24:50.447
My fiancÃ©?

24:50.531 --> 24:52.825
Jayne Murray, Dickie McDonald.

24:52.908 --> 24:54.994
I can't believe we haven't
met before now.

24:56.412 --> 24:59.456
- Let me buy you a drink.
- Thank you, but I should talk to him.

24:59.540 --> 25:00.791
And do what? Apologize?

25:00.874 --> 25:02.835
- You'll hate yourself.
- I know.

25:02.918 --> 25:04.753
Unfortunately,
I need to do it so...

25:04.837 --> 25:08.340
How about later?
The Wellington, 6:00?

25:08.424 --> 25:10.843
- Sure.
- All right. See you there.

25:18.308 --> 25:21.478
Mr. Ambassador. Thank you
for coming on such short notice.

25:21.562 --> 25:24.440
Madam President, I only wish
the situation were less grave.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.525
- Thank you. Please.
- Thank you.

25:26.608 --> 25:28.485
As you know,
we have very little time.

25:28.569 --> 25:31.488
We need your government's help
to save the men on our sub.

25:31.572 --> 25:35.117
I understand. And we do have
technology to perform the rescue.

25:35.200 --> 25:38.162
Unfortunately,
the situation is complicated.

25:38.245 --> 25:42.499
Your submarine's position relative to
the North Korean coast, for example,

25:42.583 --> 25:44.001
is a complication.

25:44.084 --> 25:48.422
The Seattle was outside Korea's waters
when the damage was sustained.

25:48.505 --> 25:50.674
Then why were you
so close in the first place?

25:50.758 --> 25:53.969
Time is short, let's be blunt.
It was spying.

25:54.053 --> 25:56.889
- Well, we're not saying that.
- Of course not.

25:56.972 --> 25:59.475
[Ambassador] Relations
with North Korea are good.

25:59.558 --> 26:02.978
They are not stable in dealing
with enemies or allies.

26:03.062 --> 26:07.649
If we help you, and the North Koreans
discover it, our relationship

26:07.733 --> 26:10.319
could change dramatically
and catastrophically.

26:10.402 --> 26:11.987
We understand the risks.

26:12.071 --> 26:15.115
That's why we're offering
consideration in exchange for help.

26:16.325 --> 26:19.453
My good friend Nathan has
mentioned the trade concessions.

26:19.536 --> 26:23.499
And softening of your
pronouncements on human rights.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.918
While my government
appreciates these things,

26:26.001 --> 26:29.671
given the scale of the request,

26:29.755 --> 26:32.007
we're looking for more consideration.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.759
What did you have in mind?

26:33.842 --> 26:37.596
There are a certain purchases we would
like to make with your allies in Europe.

26:37.679 --> 26:40.182
- The weapons. No.
- Communications systems.

26:40.265 --> 26:42.726
- Sensor systems.
- Communications for weapons.

26:42.810 --> 26:45.270
Sensors for weapons.
That's not on the table.

26:45.354 --> 26:49.358
Then it will be difficult for me
to convince my government to help.

26:53.946 --> 26:56.490
[inhaling and exhaling deeply]

26:56.573 --> 27:00.327
Look. There's the matter of China's...

27:00.410 --> 27:03.497
...how shall I put it...

27:03.580 --> 27:08.418
...frustrated efforts to
complete the sale of certain

27:08.502 --> 27:11.421
equipment to Algeria and Myanmar.

27:11.505 --> 27:16.009
So you are saying you would deny
our ability to purchase weapons,

27:16.093 --> 27:18.512
but would allow us to sell them.

27:18.595 --> 27:22.057
Put that way, it sounds almost poetic.

27:22.141 --> 27:25.018
- Would your government accept it?
- I'll get back to you.

27:25.102 --> 27:28.021
Then please do. And quickly.
We're dealing in hours.

27:28.105 --> 27:30.357
- If you'll excuse me.
- Of course.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.192
Thank you, Mr. Ambassador.

27:40.242 --> 27:43.829
- What do you think?
- I hope we don't live to regret that.

27:43.912 --> 27:45.414
That's always a possibility,

27:45.497 --> 27:48.542
but it's a certainty we would have
regretted the alternative.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.586
Arms sales to Myanmar and Algeria.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.713
It's a lot for the
Joint Chiefs to swallow.

27:52.796 --> 27:57.217
You just tell them to open
their mouths a little wider.

27:57.301 --> 28:00.262
I think I'll put it
a little more delicately.

28:08.979 --> 28:11.607
I guess if you've
moved into the White House,

28:11.690 --> 28:14.443
that means
the president's running, right?

28:14.526 --> 28:16.945
I can neither confirm nor deny.

28:17.029 --> 28:20.407
Come on. You didn't just come in
to prop her up for the next two years.

28:20.490 --> 28:23.202
What about you?
You were Nathan Templeton's right hand.

28:23.285 --> 28:26.246
- What happened?
- I wanted a change.

28:26.330 --> 28:28.749
So you became a lobbyist?

28:28.832 --> 28:32.294
- What's wrong with being a lobbyist?
- After today? You tell me.

28:33.045 --> 28:37.257
There are good days.
I get to work on issues I care about.

28:37.341 --> 28:40.469
The money's not bad.
Not all the clients are jerks.

28:40.552 --> 28:43.889
You're never going to be happy
as a lobbyist. You're a power chick.

28:45.307 --> 28:47.643
- A power chick?
- Forgive me.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.645
- A hot power chick.
- [Jayne laughs]

28:49.728 --> 28:54.650
Only somebody very interested in power
could be Templeton's chief of staff.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.527
- Maybe I'm interested in more.
- You are who you are.

28:57.611 --> 29:00.322
When you were working for Templeton,
you were the buyer.

29:00.405 --> 29:04.076
Everyone came to you.
Now you're a salesman.

29:04.159 --> 29:06.828
Is that really what you want to be?

29:06.912 --> 29:09.581
- It's more complicated than that.
- No, it's not.

29:09.665 --> 29:12.167
It's simple. Power.

29:12.251 --> 29:16.129
You have it. Or you don't.

29:16.213 --> 29:19.049
Everything else is conversation.

29:19.675 --> 29:22.928
- What's going on at the White House?
- What are you talking about?

29:23.011 --> 29:25.889
I know Jim Gardner, and I know
when something's up with him.

29:25.973 --> 29:29.851
- Sounds like you know him pretty well.
- Something break while you were there?

29:29.935 --> 29:32.437
Nope. Didn't hear a thing.

29:37.150 --> 29:38.860
[door opening]

29:38.944 --> 29:42.447
- Where are we with the rescue plan?
- Nowhere without the Chinese.

29:42.531 --> 29:44.533
We're waiting.
Let's presume we have 'em.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.994
It still won't be easy, ma'am.

29:47.077 --> 29:50.205
The Seattle's turned
approximately 50 degrees.

29:50.289 --> 29:53.208
That's why they couldn't use
the emergency escape vehicles.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.085
We can't get to the main escape hatch.

29:55.168 --> 29:57.421
Is there a secondary we have access to?

29:57.504 --> 30:00.090
Yeah. It's here.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.634
But the Chinese hatches don't fit ours.

30:02.718 --> 30:06.138
It's kinda like American plugs
in European sockets.

30:06.221 --> 30:07.723
So how do the two ships dock?

30:07.806 --> 30:10.851
We'll equip the rescue vehicle
with a modular docking collar.

30:10.934 --> 30:14.146
It'll bridge the gap. It's a tight fit.
There's no margin for error.

30:14.229 --> 30:17.357
So the Chinese pilot
better know what he's doing.

30:17.441 --> 30:20.152
Assuming we'll have a Chinese pilot.

30:21.486 --> 30:24.448
- I'll place another call.
- Will we have them?

30:24.531 --> 30:29.202
- We're running out of time, ma'am.
- We'll have an answer soon.

30:32.080 --> 30:35.751
- Boning up for the morning briefing?
- Yeah. Anything I need to know?

30:35.834 --> 30:38.378
Stock market's up.
Housing starts are down.

30:38.462 --> 30:41.089
- You wrote the starting points?
- Nothing's changed?

30:41.173 --> 30:43.008
- I'm hearing rumors...
- What rumors?

30:43.091 --> 30:47.179
- Well, Southeast Asia, North Korea...
- Who are you hearing this from?

30:47.262 --> 30:49.139
You're all holed up
in the Cabinet Room

30:49.222 --> 30:52.684
with Frances, Krieger, Shoop,
Navy brass. The East Asia team.

30:52.768 --> 30:56.063
President's back and forth to the
Sit Room. Person can connect dots.

30:56.146 --> 30:59.900
Secretary of state's in Bangalore.
We're working on labor deals.

30:59.983 --> 31:02.903
- That's the story?
- That's the truth, Kelly.

31:02.986 --> 31:05.697
Okay. I know how to answer
the question if I get it.

31:05.781 --> 31:08.116
Stock market's up.
Housing starts are down.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.951
Mm-hmm.

31:15.457 --> 31:17.793
Isn't it about time
for lights out, dear?

31:17.876 --> 31:20.629
Oh, sure, Grandma.
Just give me a second.

31:20.712 --> 31:22.714
Um... Where's Mom and Dad?

31:22.798 --> 31:24.966
[sighs] They're still working.

31:25.050 --> 31:27.469
Oh... big surprise.

31:27.552 --> 31:30.097
I'm sure it's important.

31:30.180 --> 31:31.556
Yeah. Sure.

31:31.640 --> 31:34.684
Very important.
The President of Mongolia is here,

31:34.768 --> 31:39.856
or stock market dropped a point,
or... Congressman needs his ass kissed.

31:39.940 --> 31:42.275
Becca.

31:42.359 --> 31:46.613
What? It's true.
It's what she does every day.

31:46.696 --> 31:49.366
Meanwhile, we stay here
and eat dinner... alone.

31:49.449 --> 31:51.743
And watch her on the news.

31:52.369 --> 31:54.704
If you weren't so
wrapped up in yourself,

31:54.788 --> 31:59.126
maybe you'd notice something
very serious is going on.

31:59.209 --> 32:02.295
Now I don't know what it is,
but I know this.

32:02.379 --> 32:03.588
When we're in trouble,

32:03.672 --> 32:06.967
there's no one I'd rather
see in charge than your mother.

32:07.050 --> 32:11.263
And if you don't feel that way.
If you aren't proud to feel that way.

32:11.346 --> 32:13.306
Then I just don't know you.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.272
I guess we feel differently.

32:22.107 --> 32:24.276
I guess we do.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.284
I can't sleep.

32:33.910 --> 32:36.121
Well, let's see what
we can do about that.

32:49.384 --> 32:51.803
- Any word?
- Still waiting.

32:53.847 --> 32:58.143
Has she had anything to
eat since this started?

32:58.226 --> 33:02.147
- No.
- She needs to eat. And rest.

33:02.230 --> 33:03.565
This could be a long haul.

33:05.150 --> 33:07.152
I'll... I'll talk to her.

33:14.618 --> 33:16.953
About earlier.
I'm sorry if I flew off the handle.

33:17.037 --> 33:20.582
But you touched a sore point.
I should have known about the sub.

33:20.665 --> 33:22.709
Bridges liked to keep that to himself.

33:22.792 --> 33:25.337
It's okay, Jim.

33:25.420 --> 33:28.006
But somebody
has got to talk to the generals.

33:28.089 --> 33:31.134
- This can't happen again.
- Agreed.

33:31.218 --> 33:33.053
But once this is all over, all right?

33:33.887 --> 33:35.555
Sure.

33:39.142 --> 33:41.937
You could tell him I haven't
ruled out import sanctions

33:42.020 --> 33:44.564
and we have
domestic industry to think of.

33:46.566 --> 33:48.610
Right. I know you will.

33:48.693 --> 33:50.987
Don't feel pressure
to make a deal on this trip.

33:51.071 --> 33:55.116
I don't mind making them sweat a bit.
Good. Call me when you know.

33:55.200 --> 34:00.080
Sorry, secretary of state's in Bangalore
and his day's just getting started.

34:00.163 --> 34:02.249
I was just coming down to say goodnight.

34:02.332 --> 34:04.918
Aw. Sorry we never made it
up to the residence tonight.

34:05.001 --> 34:08.547
Hey. It's fine. I'm...
I'm sure whatever it is, is important.

34:08.630 --> 34:11.424
- It is.
- I know.

34:11.507 --> 34:14.052
Look, Mom. Um...

34:14.135 --> 34:16.471
I was thinking about
what you said earlier and...

34:16.554 --> 34:20.809
I know you're going to run.
I mean, it's your choice. Whatever.

34:20.891 --> 34:23.103
You shouldn't change
your life because of me.

34:23.186 --> 34:24.688
I get that.

34:24.771 --> 34:28.483
But you said that I wouldn't
have to be a part of the campaign

34:28.567 --> 34:31.485
and... I... I really don't want to be.

34:31.570 --> 34:34.614
Okay. I know it's hard
being in the spotlight.

34:34.697 --> 34:37.449
No, you don't, Mom.

34:37.534 --> 34:40.078
You are a natural at it.
You always have been.

34:40.161 --> 34:42.621
I'm not like that.

34:42.706 --> 34:47.418
I... I don't like people staring at me,
and talking about me.

34:47.502 --> 34:48.962
I just...

34:49.045 --> 34:51.965
I want to have a normal life.
Mom, that's... that's all.

34:52.047 --> 34:55.635
Okay. Dad and I meant it when we said
you're not going to have to do anything

34:55.719 --> 34:57.512
- you don't want to do.
- Okay.

34:58.847 --> 35:01.808
I mean, I'll... I'll be in college
in a year and a half anyway.

35:01.891 --> 35:05.270
- It's not like I'll be around.
- [door opening]

35:07.188 --> 35:10.609
Ma'am, the speaker's here.
Everyone's waiting in the Cabinet Room.

35:12.277 --> 35:13.612
[both sigh]

35:14.487 --> 35:17.282
- Baby, I'm so sorry.
- I'll see you in the morning.

35:19.075 --> 35:21.703
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Mom.

35:31.504 --> 35:34.507
- [indistinct chatter]
- [door opening]

35:36.718 --> 35:38.762
Mr. Speaker?

35:38.845 --> 35:41.389
It's a deal. Beijing's accepted it.

35:41.473 --> 35:46.811
They're gonna give us access to their
ships and underwater rescue technology.

35:47.771 --> 35:51.816
General, I'm signing authorization
for a covert joint rescue mission

35:51.900 --> 35:54.152
with the Chinese:
Operation Homecoming.

35:54.235 --> 35:55.695
- Let's get started.
- Yes.

35:55.779 --> 35:58.198
- What's our time-frame?
- We're ready on our end.

35:58.281 --> 35:59.908
Start prepping the Chinese now.

35:59.991 --> 36:02.911
- Rescue underway in nine hours.
- Good. Keep me posted.

36:02.994 --> 36:04.996
- I want to at know every step.
- Of course.

36:05.080 --> 36:07.457
Thank you, everyone.

36:07.540 --> 36:09.376
You've done a great job today.

36:09.459 --> 36:12.420
Mr. Speaker, we couldn't have
done it without you.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.130
- Thank you.
- Here, here.

36:14.214 --> 36:17.092
Hang on. We gotta get them out of there.

36:17.175 --> 36:20.220
It's been a wonderful day.
Thank you for it. Congratulations.

36:20.303 --> 36:22.597
Anyone who can, go home.

36:22.681 --> 36:25.725
Get some rest.
We'll hope for good news in the morning.

36:25.809 --> 36:27.060
Thank you.

36:35.819 --> 36:38.113
Ma'am.

36:38.196 --> 36:41.241
All right. We need to get
General Krieger, Secretary Frances,

36:41.324 --> 36:43.618
and Director Shoop in
the Oval Office for a chat.

36:43.702 --> 36:44.994
That should be pleasant.

36:45.078 --> 36:47.455
I was thinking maybe
I should talk to them myself.

36:47.539 --> 36:49.708
I worked with them
under President Bridges.

36:49.791 --> 36:53.211
Let me put them on notice for you.
I can make them listen.

36:56.589 --> 36:59.050
Okay.

37:06.808 --> 37:09.352
Gotta make a show of
slapping our wrists for her, Jim?

37:09.436 --> 37:12.230
You deceived the President
of the United States, Mills.

37:12.313 --> 37:14.065
You think that merits a wrist-slap?

37:14.149 --> 37:17.193
President Bridges approved.
We put through the paperwork.

37:17.277 --> 37:20.280
Don't tell me about paperwork.
Don't tell me about Bridges.

37:20.363 --> 37:23.825
I worked for Bridges, but we all serve
at the pleasure of the president.

37:23.908 --> 37:26.828
This president.

37:26.911 --> 37:30.707
She could pull your stars, retire you.
She could transfer you to Prudhoe Bay.

37:30.790 --> 37:32.959
But you know what she did?

37:33.042 --> 37:36.838
She made a deal with the Chinese
to save our sailors.

37:36.921 --> 37:40.049
Didn't pass the buck. Put herself
on the line for your screw-up.

37:40.133 --> 37:41.801
You're going to owe her for that.

37:44.471 --> 37:48.558
Let me tell you how it's going
to be from now on. No more CYA memos.

37:48.641 --> 37:52.604
No shortcuts. No surprises.
You give her your respect.

37:53.521 --> 37:55.440
Because if nothing else...

37:57.192 --> 37:59.194
...she earned it today.

38:14.584 --> 38:17.796
Hey, sweetheart.
What are doing still up?

38:17.879 --> 38:20.006
Oh... waiting for you.

38:20.089 --> 38:22.592
The office didn't tell you
I was going to be late?

38:22.675 --> 38:25.678
Yeah, yeah. No. They called,
but I had plenty of things to do.

38:25.762 --> 38:27.806
I wanted to wait up for you.

38:27.889 --> 38:30.475
So... how was your day?

38:34.521 --> 38:36.689
It was a hell of a day, actually.

38:37.774 --> 38:40.860
It went well, in the end,
I think. I hope.

38:41.903 --> 38:43.196
And Jayne?

38:44.656 --> 38:46.699
Oh, bloody hell. I forgot about that.

38:46.783 --> 38:49.410
She turned me down flat.

38:49.494 --> 38:50.829
Said I'd hurt her feelings.

38:50.912 --> 38:53.665
Well, she looked up to you
and you fired her.

38:53.748 --> 38:56.626
- Sarah.
- Well, she has her pride.

38:56.709 --> 39:00.004
I know that you can relate to that.

39:00.088 --> 39:02.090
Very funny.

39:02.173 --> 39:05.468
She wouldn't even acknowledge
that she had betrayed my trust.

39:05.552 --> 39:08.596
With Jim Gardner, for heaven's sakes.

39:08.680 --> 39:12.141
You know, I don't know whether
I can forgive her for that.

39:12.225 --> 39:15.144
Give it time. She'll come around.

39:15.228 --> 39:16.938
I don't think so.

39:17.021 --> 39:21.276
I saw that look in her eyes.
She called me "Mr. Speaker."

39:21.359 --> 39:24.445
That's a long way from "Boss."
I liked "Boss."

39:24.529 --> 39:28.575
She's not coming back.
And I don't think I want her back.

39:28.658 --> 39:30.493
Nathan...

39:30.577 --> 39:32.996
By any measure,
she is wrong and I am right.

39:33.079 --> 39:35.373
- You know I am right.
- Oh, you want to be right?

39:38.209 --> 39:42.505
- Or you want to be happy?
- [exhaling loudly]

39:55.518 --> 39:57.979
- How are you feeling?
- Hmm.

39:58.062 --> 40:02.066
I'll feel better when the rescue's over,
and our sub crew is headed home.

40:02.150 --> 40:04.777
Well, you did a great job today.

40:06.863 --> 40:08.656
Maybe I shouldn't run.

40:08.740 --> 40:11.284
- Mac!
- We're parents first.

40:11.367 --> 40:13.161
Look, Becca's a teenager.

40:13.244 --> 40:16.122
She's going to go through
these phases no matter what we do.

40:16.205 --> 40:19.542
This isn't a phase. There's going
to be pressure to trot them out.

40:19.626 --> 40:21.044
She'll be fine.

40:21.127 --> 40:23.796
I want her to be more than fine.
I want her to flourish...

40:23.880 --> 40:27.342
She will. Look,
I'm not saying it's not a sacrifice,

40:27.425 --> 40:30.845
but she will come to see there are
things in life worth sacrificing for.

40:30.929 --> 40:33.139
- They all will.
- That's assuming I win.

40:33.222 --> 40:35.725
- What if I don't?
- You'll win.

40:35.808 --> 40:38.603
I'm not so sure.
All the money we have to raise.

40:38.686 --> 40:40.438
Things to do to get on the ballot.

40:40.521 --> 40:43.524
I could work my
ass off and still place third.

40:43.608 --> 40:46.361
- Is that worth the sacrifice?
- If you commit...

40:46.444 --> 40:48.696
I mean, if you really commit to this.

40:48.780 --> 40:50.615
You're going to win.

40:52.241 --> 40:56.204
We're going to look back on this.
In two years. In six years...

40:56.287 --> 40:58.122
[telephone ringing]

41:03.670 --> 41:06.756
Yes. Vince.

41:06.839 --> 41:09.133
Turn on the news.

41:09.217 --> 41:11.386
Get him on the line as soon as possible.

41:11.469 --> 41:15.181
North Korean State Television says
the American nuclear submarine

41:15.264 --> 41:17.976
was operating within its waters
when it went down...

41:18.059 --> 41:20.687
- My God...
- No confirmation from the White House,

41:20.770 --> 41:24.357
but the North Koreans are already
calling the incursion an act of war.

41:24.440 --> 41:27.235
- [Vince] Madam President.
- How the hell did they find out?

41:27.318 --> 41:29.779
- We don't know yet.
- Have they located our sub?

41:29.862 --> 41:32.407
We don't know.
The sub's been silent for three hours.

41:32.490 --> 41:35.326
- They're trained to stay hidden.
- Okay. What do we know?

41:35.410 --> 41:37.370
North Korea's put their troops on alert.

41:37.453 --> 41:39.872
Our satellites are tracking
missile launchers

41:39.956 --> 41:41.249
moving toward the border.

41:41.332 --> 41:43.418
We don't know if they
have nuclear weapons,

41:43.501 --> 41:45.712
but in this scenario
we can't rule it out.

41:45.795 --> 41:48.381
I'll be down at the Sit Room right away.

41:48.464 --> 41:52.010
Madam President, the North Koreans
keep using the phrase "act of war."

41:52.093 --> 41:54.429
Could be rhetoric,
but we need to be ready.

41:54.512 --> 41:58.975
The generals are suggesting we put our
Northeast Asian forces on DEFCON 3.

41:59.058 --> 42:02.103
Move them into strategic readiness
for a North Korean attack.

42:02.186 --> 42:05.106
Don't do anything yet.
I'm on my way.
