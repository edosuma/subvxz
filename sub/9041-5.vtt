WEBVTT

00:03.467 --> 00:04.800
- LOOK AT THIS.

00:04.833 --> 00:06.433
SAYS HERE I CAN
LOOK LIKE THIS GUY

00:06.467 --> 00:09.567
JUST BY WORKING OUT
15 MINUTES A DAY.

00:09.600 --> 00:10.733
- HMM.

00:12.967 --> 00:15.300
YOU BETTER MAKE IT 20.

00:19.033 --> 00:20.500
- HOW ARE YOU TWO?

00:20.533 --> 00:21.500
YEAH?

00:21.533 --> 00:22.667
SUPER.

00:24.633 --> 00:26.133
- YEAH, HELP YOURSELF, DAD.

00:26.167 --> 00:28.133
- YOUR MOTHER'S NEVER
AT HOME ANYMORE.

00:28.167 --> 00:31.667
SHE HASN'T COOKED FOR ME
IN A MONTH.

00:31.700 --> 00:33.067
- AH, SHE'S REALLY LOVING
THAT SCULPTURE CLASS,

00:33.100 --> 00:34.267
ISN'T SHE?

00:34.300 --> 00:35.267
- [sarcastically]
YEAH.

00:35.300 --> 00:38.367
THANKS FOR TALKING HER
INTO THAT.

00:38.400 --> 00:41.267
I JUST ATE A FISTFUL
OF BOUILLON CUBES.

00:45.167 --> 00:46.800
- HEY, DID YOU KNOW
THAT MARIE'S TEACHER

00:46.833 --> 00:48.500
SAID THAT SHE HAS
REAL TALENT?

00:48.533 --> 00:49.367
- REALLY?

00:49.400 --> 00:52.767
THE TEACHER
THAT SHE PAYS?

00:52.800 --> 00:54.000
- NEVER MIND.

00:54.033 --> 00:55.233
LOOK, SHE'S MEETING
NEW PEOPLE.

00:55.267 --> 00:57.000
I THINK THAT'S GOOD FOR HER.

00:57.033 --> 00:59.533
- HAVE YOU TALKED TO THEM?

01:02.200 --> 01:07.600
announcer: ANOTHER SEASON OF
"EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND."

01:07.633 --> 01:10.600
[grunting]

01:10.633 --> 01:13.533
[intense instrumental music]

01:19.433 --> 01:21.100
[laughter]

01:35.467 --> 01:37.833
- HI, EVERYONE.

01:37.867 --> 01:39.100
- OH, MY GOD, LOOK.

01:39.133 --> 01:42.100
THEY'VE TENTED YOUR MOTHER
FOR TERMITES.

01:43.533 --> 01:46.833
- I FINISHED THE PIECE
I WAS WORKING ON.

01:46.867 --> 01:48.500
- IS IT A SANDWICH?

01:49.900 --> 01:51.000
- I'M SO EXCITED.

01:51.033 --> 01:52.400
I CAN'T WAIT
FOR YOU TO SEE IT.

01:52.433 --> 01:53.467
ARE YOU READY?

01:53.500 --> 01:54.467
- READY?

01:54.500 --> 01:55.633
- BRING IT IN, ROBBIE.

01:55.667 --> 01:56.700
BE CAREFUL.

01:56.733 --> 01:57.767
- HEY, EVERYBODY--

01:57.800 --> 02:00.167
- SHH!
DON'T RUIN THE MOMENT.

02:01.433 --> 02:03.733
OKAY, EVERYBODY.

02:03.767 --> 02:05.800
[giggles]

02:05.833 --> 02:08.900
I WANT TO THANK
BOTH RAYMOND AND DEBRA

02:08.933 --> 02:10.667
FOR THEIR SUPPORT
AND ENCOURAGEMENT

02:10.700 --> 02:12.667
OF MY ARTISTIC PURSUITS.

02:12.700 --> 02:13.800
- [snoring]

02:13.833 --> 02:15.567
- ALL RIGHT, FRANK.

02:15.600 --> 02:19.233
- AND IN THE TRADITION
OF ARTISTS AND THEIR PATRONS,

02:19.267 --> 02:21.767
THE MICHELANGELOS
AND THE MEDICIS,

02:21.800 --> 02:23.300
I GIVE YOU...

02:23.333 --> 02:25.233
THIS.

02:27.767 --> 02:28.733
- [gasps]

02:28.767 --> 02:30.933
MARIE, THIS IS FANTASTIC.

02:30.967 --> 02:31.933
- YOU LIKE IT?

02:31.967 --> 02:33.900
- WOW.
- YEAH, OH.

02:33.933 --> 02:36.067
I LOVE IT.
YOU REALLY DID THIS?

02:36.100 --> 02:38.433
- YEAH, MA, IT'S GREAT!

02:38.467 --> 02:41.300
- ROBBIE, TURN ON
THE LIGHTS.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.767
- CAN I TALK TO YOU?

02:43.800 --> 02:46.133
COME OVER HERE A SECOND.

02:46.167 --> 02:49.833
DID YOU LOOK
AT THE SCULPTURE?

02:49.867 --> 02:50.933
- YEAH, IT'S GREAT.
WHAT?

02:50.967 --> 02:53.733
- YEAH, WELL,
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?

02:56.667 --> 02:57.667
- I DON'T KNOW.

02:57.700 --> 02:59.433
IT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE ANYTHING.

02:59.467 --> 03:03.300
- OH, IT--IT DEFINITELY
LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING.

03:08.833 --> 03:11.067
- WHAT?

03:11.100 --> 03:14.433
- DON'T YOU THINK
IT LOOKS A LITTLE LIKE A...

03:14.467 --> 03:15.767
HMM?

03:19.800 --> 03:21.433
- WHAT?

03:22.800 --> 03:24.633
- ISN'T IT A BIT TOO...

03:24.667 --> 03:26.633
LADYLIKE?

03:34.333 --> 03:35.467
- GREAT!

03:35.500 --> 03:36.300
- YOU SEE?

03:36.333 --> 03:38.100
- OH, NOW I DO,
THANK YOU.

03:38.133 --> 03:40.833
- [laughs]
RAYMOND.

03:40.867 --> 03:41.933
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

03:41.967 --> 03:43.133
- WHAT?
YEAH.

03:43.167 --> 03:44.800
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
IT'S GOOD.

03:44.833 --> 03:46.000
- UH-HUH?

03:46.033 --> 03:50.733
- YEAH, IT--IT'S WONDERFUL,
MARIE, REALLY.

03:50.767 --> 03:52.000
- SO, MA, WHAT IS IT?

03:52.033 --> 03:54.100
- IT'S AN ABSTRACT.

03:54.133 --> 03:55.300
- NOT ABSTRACT ENOUGH.

03:55.333 --> 03:57.033
- [giggles]

03:57.067 --> 03:59.200
YOU'VE DONE
AN AMAZING JOB.

04:00.333 --> 04:01.800
- IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING,
THOUGH.

04:01.833 --> 04:03.467
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?

04:10.267 --> 04:12.833
- I DON'T THINK
RAYMOND LIKES IT.

04:12.867 --> 04:14.167
- WHAT?

04:14.200 --> 04:16.233
- YOU'RE HARDLY
LOOKING AT IT.

04:16.267 --> 04:18.867
- WHA--
I'M LOOKIN' AT IT.

04:18.900 --> 04:20.567
- YOU CAN GET CLOSE.
YOU CAN EVEN TOUCH IT.

04:20.600 --> 04:21.767
- I'M FINE!

04:27.100 --> 04:28.333
- THIS IS BUGGING ME.

04:28.367 --> 04:30.567
WHERE HAVE I SEEN
THIS BEFORE?

04:36.233 --> 04:38.233
- YOU KNOW,
THE GREEKS USED TO SAY

04:38.267 --> 04:39.633
THAT THE SHAPE
IS IN THE STONE

04:39.667 --> 04:42.567
JUST WAITING
TO COME OUT.

04:42.600 --> 04:44.633
- [whispering]
WHAT?

04:51.900 --> 04:55.000
OH...MY GOD!

04:57.733 --> 04:58.700
- WHAT, ROBBIE?

04:58.733 --> 05:00.200
- HUH?

05:00.233 --> 05:02.000
NO--IT'S--IT'S NOTHING.

05:02.033 --> 05:03.700
IT'S FABULOUS!

05:05.700 --> 05:06.867
ABSTRACT!

05:06.900 --> 05:08.300
VERY...

05:10.767 --> 05:11.867
- I GOT TO TELL YA,

05:11.900 --> 05:14.767
I--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE HELL THIS IS,

05:14.800 --> 05:16.300
BUT I LOVE IT.

05:19.533 --> 05:20.867
- DO YOU REALLY, FRANK?

05:20.900 --> 05:22.400
OH, THANK YOU.

05:26.067 --> 05:27.167
- WELL...

05:27.200 --> 05:29.700
- YOU SEE IT, HUH?
- YEAH, MAKE IT STOP.

05:31.367 --> 05:33.367
- WELL, WHERE
SHOULD WE PUT IT?

05:33.400 --> 05:35.467
- WHAT?

05:35.500 --> 05:38.233
- IT'S A GIFT
TO YOU AND RAYMOND.

05:39.400 --> 05:43.100
- [laughing]
MAN, OH, MAN.

05:48.900 --> 05:50.967
- I THINK IT LOOKS GREAT
RIGHT HERE.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.267
IT BECOMES THE FOCAL POINT
OF THE WHOLE ROOM.

05:54.300 --> 05:55.900
- OH, MY GOD,
YOU HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING!

05:55.933 --> 05:57.133
- YEAH?
WHY ME?

05:57.167 --> 06:00.033
- BECAUSE THIS IS
A WOMAN'S ISSUE.

06:00.067 --> 06:03.033
- YOU KNOW HOW YOU CAN TELL
IT'S GOOD ART?

06:03.067 --> 06:06.033
BECAUSE IT FOLLOWS YOU
WHEN YOU MOVE.

06:10.467 --> 06:12.867
- ROBBIE, LET'S TAKE THE DOLLY
BACK TO THE STUDIO.

06:12.900 --> 06:15.000
- WITH PLEASURE, MOTHER.

06:16.333 --> 06:19.033
ENJOY YOUR SCULPTURE,
RAYMOND!

06:19.933 --> 06:23.333
[laughs]

06:23.367 --> 06:25.067
TA-TA!

06:29.267 --> 06:30.633
- DAD?

06:30.667 --> 06:32.600
DAD, YOU CAN GO NOW, TOO.

06:32.633 --> 06:34.200
- IN A MINUTE.

06:34.233 --> 06:36.267
- COME ON, YOU CAN
VISIT IT LATER, ALL RIGHT?

06:36.300 --> 06:37.800
- HEY, YOU KNOW,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,

06:37.833 --> 06:39.133
I'M GONNA BRING
MY CAMERA OVER HERE

06:39.167 --> 06:41.900
AND GET A SHOT OF ALL OF US
STANDING AROUND IT.

06:41.933 --> 06:43.533
HEY, THAT COULD BE
OUR CHRISTMAS CARD!

06:43.567 --> 06:45.267
- YEAH.

06:49.133 --> 06:50.333
- YOU KNOW...

06:50.367 --> 06:52.000
MAYBE...

06:52.033 --> 06:55.967
WELL, FROM THIS ANGLE,
IT LOOKS KIND OF LIKE A...

06:56.000 --> 06:59.333
LIKE A...

06:59.367 --> 07:00.133
A SAILBOAT.

07:00.167 --> 07:01.967
YES, I-I SEE A SAILBOAT.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.633
- A SAILBOAT THAT COULD
USE A PAIR OF UNDERWEAR!

07:09.400 --> 07:11.767
- OKAY, LISTEN.

07:11.800 --> 07:12.933
YOUR MOTHER GAVE THIS TO US,

07:12.967 --> 07:14.067
AND IF WE HAVE
TO LIVE WITH IT,

07:14.100 --> 07:15.733
IT'S GONNA BE A SAILBOAT.

07:15.767 --> 07:16.900
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

07:16.933 --> 07:18.067
I'M NOT LIVING WITH IT, OKAY?

07:18.100 --> 07:19.333
I CAN'T LIVE WITH IT!

07:19.367 --> 07:21.100
- YOU CAN'T TELL HER THAT.

07:21.133 --> 07:22.733
NOW, THIS MAY
MAKE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE,

07:22.767 --> 07:23.933
BUT WE HAVE GOT
TO SUPPORT HER.

07:23.967 --> 07:25.367
- OH, GREAT, YES,
WE'LL SUPPORT HER.

07:25.400 --> 07:27.100
MEANTIME, THERE'S GONNA BE
A COVER CHARGE

07:27.133 --> 07:29.233
TO GET IN OUR LIVING ROOM.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.800
- I CAN'T FIND MY CRAYONS.

07:35.833 --> 07:37.033
- CRAYONS?

07:37.067 --> 07:38.600
NO, THERE'S
NO CRAYONS HERE.

07:38.633 --> 07:40.700
- HERE THEY ARE, HONEY.
THERE YOU GO, SWEETIE.

07:40.733 --> 07:41.733
- WHAT'S THAT?

07:41.767 --> 07:42.733
- WHAT?
WHAT?

07:42.767 --> 07:44.167
- OH.
LOOK.

07:44.200 --> 07:46.033
IT'S SOMETHING
THAT YOUR GRANDMOTHER

07:46.067 --> 07:47.667
CARVED OUT OF STONE.

07:47.700 --> 07:48.767
THIS IS CALLED A SCULPTURE.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.167
THIS IS ART.

07:53.567 --> 07:56.367
OKAY, MAYBE THAT'S ENOUGH
ART FOR NOW.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.733
SHOO.
GO PLAY.

07:57.767 --> 07:58.767
- CAN I COLOR IT?

07:58.800 --> 08:00.633
- NO.
GO UPSTAIRS.

08:04.567 --> 08:07.100
- YOU KNOW, NOT THAT
I WOULD ENCOURAGE IT,

08:07.133 --> 08:09.133
BUT THE WAY HE WAS LOOKING
AT IT, THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?

08:09.167 --> 08:10.667
HE'S LIKE A LITTLE MAN.

08:13.633 --> 08:15.233
- IDIOT.
- WHAT?

08:15.267 --> 08:17.600
BECAUSE MY FATHER
WAS CONCERNED ABOUT HIM

08:17.633 --> 08:19.267
IN THAT DEPARTMENT.

08:28.167 --> 08:30.000
OH, DAMN,
IT DOES FOLLOW YOU.

08:42.267 --> 08:43.933
ALL RIGHT, IF YOU'RE GONNA
STAND THERE,

08:43.967 --> 08:45.333
AT LEAST BLOCK MY VIEW.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.567
WHAT?

08:50.600 --> 08:52.700
- I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT,
AND I'M WONDERING,

08:52.733 --> 08:55.300
WHERE'S MY SCULPTURE?

08:55.333 --> 08:56.600
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

08:56.633 --> 08:57.533
YOU WANT ONE OF THESE?

08:57.567 --> 08:59.533
- YOU MEAN A SIGN OF AFFECTION
FROM MY MOTHER?

08:59.567 --> 09:02.000
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT'S THAT LIKE?

09:03.100 --> 09:05.300
- THIS IS A SIGN
OF AFFECTION?

09:05.333 --> 09:08.167
- IN ITS OWN
DISTURBING WAY, YES.

09:08.200 --> 09:09.767
- OH, GOD.
YOU'RE SICK.

09:09.800 --> 09:10.800
- YOU'RE SICK.
- YOU.

09:10.833 --> 09:12.100
- I LOATHE YOU.

09:12.133 --> 09:13.600
- OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, ANYWAY.

09:13.633 --> 09:14.900
BYE.

09:14.933 --> 09:16.000
OKAY, GREAT.

09:16.033 --> 09:17.367
THE PARKERS' BASEMENT
IS FLOODED.

09:17.400 --> 09:19.367
- HA HA, THAT'S FUNNY.
I HATE THAT PARKER.

09:21.833 --> 09:22.833
- NO, THAT'S NOT FUNNY, RAY.

09:22.867 --> 09:24.000
THEIR WHOLE HOUSE
IS FLOODED.

09:24.033 --> 09:25.267
THAT MEANS NO PLAY DATE.

09:25.300 --> 09:28.033
- OH. SO WHY CAN'T THE KIDS
JUST COME OVER HERE?

09:28.067 --> 09:29.033
- I DON'T KNOW, RAY.

09:29.067 --> 09:30.167
DO WE REALLY WANT TO HAVE

09:30.200 --> 09:31.667
ALL THE NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS
COME OVER HERE

09:31.700 --> 09:35.233
AND LEARN ABOUT THE BIRDS
AND THE GIGANTIC BEES?

09:35.267 --> 09:36.867
- I THOUGHT IT WAS
A SAILBOAT.

09:36.900 --> 09:38.533
- FRANK, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:38.567 --> 09:40.167
HE'S BEEN STANDING THERE
FOR AN HOUR.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.600
WOULD YOU STOP
STARING AT THAT?

09:41.633 --> 09:43.700
YOU'RE FREAKIN' ME OUT!

09:43.733 --> 09:45.267
- WHY?
IT'S JUST A SAILBOAT.

09:45.300 --> 09:47.300
- THAT'S NO SAILBOAT!

09:47.333 --> 09:48.767
- ALL RIGHT.
LOOK, COME ON, DAD.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.233
- WHERE ARE WE GOING?

09:50.267 --> 09:51.733
- PIZZA.

09:51.767 --> 09:53.033
- CAN'T WE JUST ORDER IN?

09:53.067 --> 09:54.433
- LET'S GO.

09:55.633 --> 09:58.033
- HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
PIZZA SOUNDS GOOD.

09:58.067 --> 09:59.233
I'M GONNA GET
A COUPLE SLICES.

09:59.267 --> 10:01.000
- OH, NO, NO, NO.
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

10:01.033 --> 10:02.167
- WHY?
WHY NOT?

10:02.200 --> 10:03.800
- BECAUSE I CAN'T TAKE
ONE MORE DAY

10:03.833 --> 10:05.233
BEING STUCK HERE
WITH THAT,

10:05.267 --> 10:07.133
AND THE KIDS
AND THEIR QUESTIONS--

10:07.167 --> 10:08.200
"WHY DID GRANDMA
MAKE THAT?

10:08.233 --> 10:11.767
WHAT IS IT?
WHY IS IT SO BIG?"

10:11.800 --> 10:13.167
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

10:13.200 --> 10:14.767
I AM SEEING IT
IN MY SLEEP.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.333
I SEE IT,

10:16.367 --> 10:17.767
AND I KNOW
IT'S YOUR MOTHER'S,

10:17.800 --> 10:19.300
AND WE HAVE TO
GET RID OF IT.

10:22.767 --> 10:24.033
- ALL RIGHT.

10:24.067 --> 10:26.000
I'M WITH YOU.
HOW?

10:26.033 --> 10:27.833
- I DON'T KNOW, HONEY.
JUST--JUST DO IT, OKAY?

10:27.867 --> 10:29.133
I CAN'T LOOK AT IT ANYMORE.

10:29.167 --> 10:30.233
- ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.

10:30.267 --> 10:32.700
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M...

10:32.733 --> 10:34.233
I'M COVERING IT UP
FOR NOW.

10:35.967 --> 10:39.367
I'LL START SANDING IT DOWN
TOMORROW.

10:39.400 --> 10:40.567
EVERY DAY
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

10:40.600 --> 10:43.300
I'LL SNEAK THE DUST OUT
IN MY PANTS TO THE YARD.

10:45.767 --> 10:47.733
- I WAS JUST IN THE--

10:52.867 --> 10:55.833
- YOU KNOW WHAT I'M DOIN'?

10:55.867 --> 10:57.167
I'M COVERIN' IT UP...

10:57.200 --> 10:59.667
BECAUSE IT SEEMS...

10:59.700 --> 11:01.267
SO ALIVE.

11:01.300 --> 11:03.533
THAT IT SHOULD REST
AT NIGHT.

11:12.900 --> 11:14.733
NIGHTY-NIGHT.

11:23.433 --> 11:24.467
- RAYMOND?

11:24.500 --> 11:28.500
YOU'RE COVERING MY SCULPTURE
WITH A GARBAGE BAG?

11:28.533 --> 11:30.933
- WELL, UH, WELL...

11:30.967 --> 11:32.100
- WE DIDN'T WANT IT
TO GET DIRTY.

11:32.133 --> 11:34.633
YOU KNOW HOW DUSTY
I LET THIS HOUSE GET.

11:36.167 --> 11:38.867
I KNOW, DEAR,
BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

11:38.900 --> 11:41.167
I GAVE IT TO YOU
TO ENJOY.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.800
A LITTLE DUST
CAN'T HURT IT.

11:42.833 --> 11:45.133
- YEAH, I KNOW, BUT DON'T YOU
WANT TO ENJOY IT, TOO?

11:45.167 --> 11:46.267
YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR

11:46.300 --> 11:48.200
THAT--THAT WE GET
ALL THE ENJOYMENT.

11:48.233 --> 11:49.567
MAYBE YOU COULD KEEP IT
AT YOUR HOUSE,

11:49.600 --> 11:53.333
AND WE COULD COME BY
FOR ENJOYABLE VISITS.

11:53.367 --> 11:55.667
- YEAH, THAT--
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

11:55.700 --> 11:57.500
- BUT I GAVE IT TO YOU.

11:57.533 --> 11:58.967
- YES.
YES, YOU DID.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.733
AND--AND WE LOVE IT.

12:00.767 --> 12:02.133
- LOVE IT!

12:06.367 --> 12:10.633
- BUT I WAS JUST THINKING,
JUST NOW, UM...

12:10.667 --> 12:12.067
IT'S SO PRECIOUS,
I MEAN,

12:12.100 --> 12:13.667
WHAT IF ONE OF THE KIDS
BREAKS IT?

12:13.700 --> 12:16.200
- YEAH.
THAT WOULD BE BAD.

12:20.300 --> 12:21.833
- WELL, IF YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT THAT,

12:21.867 --> 12:22.933
WE COULD MOVE IT.

12:22.967 --> 12:24.200
OOH, IT COULD GO
IN YOUR BEDROOM.

12:24.233 --> 12:27.600
- NO, NO.
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

12:27.633 --> 12:31.333
- WE--WE DON'T REALLY LIKE
ART IN THE BEDROOM.

12:33.200 --> 12:35.033
- TOO HIGHFALUTIN.

12:36.067 --> 12:37.700
WE'RE SIMPLE FOLK.

12:44.100 --> 12:46.167
- ARE YOU SAYING
YOU DON'T WANT IT?

12:50.967 --> 12:54.133
- WELL, THE THING IS,

12:54.167 --> 12:57.333
IT'S NOT REALLY
MY TASTE.

12:57.367 --> 12:59.500
YOU KNOW, I LIKE THE KIND
OF STATUES...

12:59.533 --> 13:05.433
LIKE A HORSE
OR SOMEBODY'S HEAD,

13:05.467 --> 13:07.433
YOU KNOW,
OR THE HEISMAN TROPHY.

13:07.467 --> 13:08.633
THAT'S A BEAUTY.

13:11.967 --> 13:15.600
- I'M REALLY INTO
UNICORNS MYSELF.

13:17.433 --> 13:19.767
- I SEE.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.267
ALL RIGHT.

13:22.567 --> 13:23.800
- WELL...

13:23.833 --> 13:26.300
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR CANDOR.

13:26.333 --> 13:28.400
- OKAY, BUT--BUT YOU'RE REALLY
A GREAT SCULPTRESS.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.133
HEY, YOU KNOW,
WHY DON'T YOU--

13:30.167 --> 13:32.800
WHY DON'T YOU DO
LIKE, UH, A MOUNT RUSHMORE,

13:32.833 --> 13:34.733
ONLY...WITH US?

13:37.833 --> 13:40.300
- IT'S OKAY, RAYMOND,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP IT.

13:40.333 --> 13:41.767
AND I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO COME

13:41.800 --> 13:43.800
TO THE CLASS EXHIBIT,
EITHER.

13:43.833 --> 13:46.800
I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY
YOU WOULDN'T ENJOY IT.

13:46.833 --> 13:48.100
- OH, MARIE.

13:48.133 --> 13:49.267
- AND I'M SORRY
THAT IT HAD TO BE

13:49.300 --> 13:50.967
IN YOUR HOUSE FOR SO LONG.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.367
I'LL HAVE IT REMOVED
JUST AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

14:00.967 --> 14:02.467
- I THINK IT'S MAD.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.233
[doorbell rings]

14:22.967 --> 14:25.800
[mouth full]
HELLO.

14:25.833 --> 14:27.033
- HELLO.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.433
RAYMOND BARONE?

14:28.467 --> 14:29.367
- MM-HMM.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.200
- I'M SISTER ANN;
THIS IS SISTER BETH.

14:31.233 --> 14:33.200
WE'RE HERE TO PICK UP
THE SCULPTURE.

14:41.700 --> 14:43.233
- YOU'RE WHAT?

14:43.267 --> 14:46.333
- THE ONE YOUR MOTHER DONATED
TO THE CHURCH AUCTION.

14:46.367 --> 14:48.200
- OH, OH, OH.
OH, OH, YEAH, YEAH.

14:48.233 --> 14:50.167
THAT SCULPTURE,
THAT'S NOT HERE ANYMORE.

14:50.200 --> 14:51.300
- IT'S NOT?
- NO, NO, NO.

14:51.333 --> 14:52.633
- ISN'T THAT A SCULPTURE?

14:52.667 --> 14:53.933
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

14:53.967 --> 14:55.900
- BUT--BUT--BUT--
OW!

14:55.933 --> 14:57.300
- SORRY.

14:57.333 --> 14:59.700
- OW.

14:59.733 --> 15:00.933
- SORRY.

15:00.967 --> 15:03.267
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

15:03.300 --> 15:05.833
SORRY, SISTER, YES,
UH, YOU MEAN THAT SCULPTURE.

15:05.867 --> 15:07.600
YEAH, YEAH,
THAT'S THE SCULPTURE.

15:07.633 --> 15:09.100
I--I--WE...

15:09.133 --> 15:10.733
WE HAD ANOTHER SCULPTURE.

15:10.767 --> 15:11.867
I GOT CONFUSED,
THAT'S ALL.

15:11.900 --> 15:13.600
THAT'S--
THAT'S THE SCULPTURE.

15:13.633 --> 15:15.133
I WAS NOT LYING TO NUNS.

15:17.733 --> 15:19.200
- OKAY,
LET'S LOAD IT UP.

15:19.233 --> 15:20.900
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
TAKE IT AWAY.

15:20.933 --> 15:22.800
ENJOY IT.

15:22.833 --> 15:24.133
THE SHEET COMES WITH IT.

15:24.167 --> 15:25.667
YOU GET THAT FOR FREE.

15:25.700 --> 15:26.733
NO LIE.
HA HA.

15:26.767 --> 15:29.000
YOU KNOW WHAT, THE SHEET SHOULD
STAY ON IT ALL THE TIME.

15:29.033 --> 15:30.533
IT'S KIND OF
PART OF THE SCULPTURE.

15:30.567 --> 15:31.733
IT'S--NO--NO.

15:54.600 --> 15:56.833
- OH, MY.

15:56.867 --> 15:58.467
- WELL...

15:58.500 --> 16:00.033
- PRETTY ABSTRACT, HUH?

16:00.067 --> 16:01.433
OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

16:01.467 --> 16:03.633
LET'S, UH--
LET'S LOAD THIS PUPPY UP, HUH?

16:08.633 --> 16:11.467
- GOOD, SISTERS,
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

16:11.500 --> 16:12.533
- OH, BOY.

16:12.567 --> 16:15.133
- MRS. BARONE, HELLO.

16:15.167 --> 16:16.933
IS THAT THE SCULPTURE
YOU INTENDED

16:16.967 --> 16:18.933
TO CONTRIBUTE
TO THE CHURCH AUCTION?

16:18.967 --> 16:20.100
- YES.

16:20.133 --> 16:23.200
- WELL, DON'T YOU THINK
THE SUBJECT MATTER IS...

16:23.233 --> 16:25.500
MIGHT BE INAPPROPRIATE?

16:26.900 --> 16:29.733
- SUBJECT MATTER?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

16:29.767 --> 16:34.200
- FORGIVE ME, BUT IS THAT
NOT A SCULPTURE OF...

16:35.567 --> 16:36.767
- WHAT?

16:43.700 --> 16:47.300
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

16:47.333 --> 16:50.333
- IT'S JUST THAT
IT MAY NOT BE RIGHT FOR--

16:50.367 --> 16:52.500
- ARE YOU CRAZY?

16:52.533 --> 16:54.333
- OKAY, UH, SISTERS,
THANK YOU FOR COMING BY.

16:54.367 --> 16:55.733
WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE IT.

16:55.767 --> 16:58.367
- IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE,
WE'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE IT.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.633
IF YOU HAVE A SCULPTURE
OF ALMOST ANYTHING ELSE.

17:00.667 --> 17:02.000
- YEAH, UH, WE DON'T--

17:02.033 --> 17:03.833
WE DON'T HAVE
ANY MORE SCULPTURES; WE DON'T.

17:03.867 --> 17:04.967
I HAVE A CERAMIC PIG
UPSTAIRS.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.967
IT'S FULL OF QUARTERS.
YOU WANT THAT?

17:07.000 --> 17:09.100
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL JUST BE GOING.

17:09.133 --> 17:10.100
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

17:10.133 --> 17:11.967
THANK YOU.
GOD BLESS YOU.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.233
I'LL SEE YOU SUNDAY.
I'M GONNA BRING THE PIG!

17:21.067 --> 17:23.167
NUNS, RIGHT?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:31.300 --> 17:34.367
- RAYMOND, DO YOU SEE
WHAT THEY SEE?

17:34.400 --> 17:38.533
- UM...

17:38.567 --> 17:39.833
I DON'T KNOW.

17:39.867 --> 17:41.333
- NO, TELL ME THE TRUTH.

17:42.467 --> 17:44.067
- WELL...

17:44.100 --> 17:46.333
MAYBE IF I SQUINT
A LITTLE.

17:52.100 --> 17:54.067
- OH, MY GOD,
I'M A LESBIAN.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.833
- MOM.

18:05.867 --> 18:07.233
- WELL, LOOK AT IT!

18:07.267 --> 18:09.400
- I'VE SEEN IT!
- I MEAN, IT--

18:09.433 --> 18:10.967
IT'S SO OBVIOUS.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.767
- NO, NO,
IT'S NOT, REALLY.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.500
- I'M A FAILURE.

18:17.667 --> 18:19.700
- HEY...

18:21.500 --> 18:23.133
THERE.

18:26.833 --> 18:29.700
SO WHAT?

18:29.733 --> 18:34.200
YOU--YOU MADE A...THING.

18:34.233 --> 18:35.633
- IT'S NOT THAT, RAYMOND.

18:35.667 --> 18:37.100
I'M NOT A PRUDE.

18:37.133 --> 18:39.767
THE FEMALE BODY
IS A BEAUTIFUL--

18:39.800 --> 18:40.767
- OKAY, OKAY.

18:40.800 --> 18:41.967
OKAY.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.967
SO--SO WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU?

18:45.000 --> 18:48.333
- WELL, IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE AN ABSTRACT.

18:48.367 --> 18:50.233
THE TEACHER TOLD US
THAT WE COULD MAKE

18:50.267 --> 18:52.333
ANY KIND OF A STATUE
WE WANTED.

18:52.367 --> 18:53.933
AND SO I CHOSE
AN ABSTRACT

18:53.967 --> 18:56.167
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
IT WAS EASY.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.367
TURNS OUT
I CAN'T EVEN DO THAT.

19:00.833 --> 19:03.600
- DEBRA THINKS IT LOOKS
LIKE A SAILBOAT.

19:07.500 --> 19:10.067
- THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH HER.

19:14.433 --> 19:19.433
I JUST TRIED TO DO
SOMETHING DIFFERENT,

19:19.467 --> 19:22.000
FIND SOMETHING NEW.

19:22.033 --> 19:23.767
THAT'S ALL.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.100
SOMETHING MORE
THAN JUST BEING

19:25.133 --> 19:28.100
A SHORT-ORDER COOK
FOR YOUR FATHER.

19:30.067 --> 19:33.033
- YOU WANTED TO FIND
SOMETHING NEW ABOUT YOURSELF?

19:33.067 --> 19:34.733
- MM-HMM.

19:34.767 --> 19:36.700
- WELL...

19:36.733 --> 19:38.100
NOBODY EXPECTED THIS.

19:41.267 --> 19:42.700
TA-DA!

19:44.700 --> 19:46.233
- ALL RIGHT, RAYMOND.

19:46.267 --> 19:48.667
- NO, I MEAN, COME ON, MA, LOOK,
YOU MADE SOMETHING HERE.

19:48.700 --> 19:50.700
- IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

19:50.733 --> 19:53.300
- HEY, SO WAS PENICILLIN.

19:53.333 --> 19:55.967
AND ROBERT.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.167
NO, COME ON.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.167
REALLY, COME OVER HERE.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.367
LOOK.
LOOK AT THIS.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.100
I MEAN, LOOK.

20:01.133 --> 20:04.900
ALL RIGHT,
IT MAY NOT BE MY TASTE,

20:04.933 --> 20:06.800
BUT--BUT THIS USED TO BE
JUST A ROCK, OKAY?

20:06.833 --> 20:08.967
EVEN I CAN
APPRECIATE THAT.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.867
AND WHAT DO MOST PEOPLE
WHO TAKE AN ART CLASS--

20:10.900 --> 20:12.000
WHAT DO THEY MAKE?

20:12.033 --> 20:14.467
LIKE A LITTLE PAPERWEIGHT
OR AN ASHTRAY,

20:14.500 --> 20:17.333
BUT LOOK WHAT YOU DID.

20:17.367 --> 20:18.733
YOU...

20:18.767 --> 20:21.367
YOU KNOW, I MEAN--

20:21.400 --> 20:25.167
LOOK AT THIS.
YOU MADE THIS.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.967
YOU--YOU GOT
PEOPLE TALKING.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.400
YOU SHOCKED PEOPLE, RIGHT?

20:30.833 --> 20:34.133
I THINK THAT'S WHAT
REAL ARTISTS DO.

20:34.167 --> 20:35.667
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

20:38.800 --> 20:40.467
- THANK YOU, RAYMOND.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.333
YOU'RE A GOOD BOY.

20:42.367 --> 20:43.533
- HMM.

20:45.667 --> 20:48.767
BUT REALLY, YOU GOT TO GET IT
OUT OF HERE.

20:55.767 --> 20:57.767
- OH, THANK YOU FOR COMING.

20:57.800 --> 21:00.067
I'M SO THRILLED YOU CAME.

21:00.100 --> 21:02.100
- WELL, MARIE, YOUR PIECE
WAS THE HIT OF THE SHOW.

21:02.133 --> 21:04.233
- OH, THANK YOU, DEAR.

21:04.267 --> 21:05.433
- CONGRATULATIONS, YEAH.

21:05.467 --> 21:07.300
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO DEDICATE IT TO ME.

21:09.567 --> 21:10.867
- WHO ELSE?

21:10.900 --> 21:13.267
- [mocking]
WHO ELSE?

21:15.833 --> 21:17.100
- YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.

21:17.133 --> 21:20.400
I GOT TO GO HOME
AND WASH MY EYES.

21:20.433 --> 21:22.600
- OKAY, LET'S GO.
WHERE'S FRANK?

21:29.733 --> 21:31.367
- IF YOU ASK ME,
IT LOOKS LIKE A...

21:49.800 --> 21:51.367
- HOLY CRAP!
