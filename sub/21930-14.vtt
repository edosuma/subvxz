00:02.289 --> 00:04.721
Space is the mirror of the soul.

00:04.724 --> 00:08.960
Are we looking beyond,
or are we looking within?

00:08.962 --> 00:10.728
I'm looking at my shoes.

00:10.730 --> 00:13.131
This is making me a
little motion sick.

00:14.267 --> 00:17.335
When we gaze out
at the immensities of space,

00:17.337 --> 00:19.304
we understand them
because there are immensities

00:19.306 --> 00:21.339
within us as well.

00:21.341 --> 00:22.874
I'm Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali,

00:22.876 --> 00:27.112
and thank you
for taking a walk with me...

00:27.114 --> 00:28.780
through the stars.

00:31.284 --> 00:34.619
That pause gets
longer every show.

00:34.621 --> 00:36.654
I believe...

00:36.656 --> 00:38.289
you're right.

00:38.291 --> 00:39.858
Hey.

00:39.860 --> 00:41.059
Can I get a picture with you?

00:41.061 --> 00:42.127
Absolutely.

00:42.129 --> 00:44.229
And if you post it
on social media,

00:44.231 --> 00:46.064
I suggest the hashtag
"Koothra-poet."

00:47.634 --> 00:49.033
Thank you. The show was great.

00:49.035 --> 00:50.235
Well, I can't take
all the credit.

00:50.237 --> 00:51.903
I have pretty good co-stars.

00:51.905 --> 00:54.706
The stars.

00:56.443 --> 00:58.543
Do you say that to everyone?

00:58.545 --> 00:59.944
Only to beautiful women.

00:59.946 --> 01:01.946
And okay women.

01:01.948 --> 01:03.581
Okay.

01:03.583 --> 01:06.151
Uh, just to clarify:
you're the first kind.

01:06.153 --> 01:07.485
Okay.

01:09.656 --> 01:10.855
Thanks for coming.

01:10.857 --> 01:13.024
What did you handsome
gentlemen think of the show?

01:13.026 --> 01:14.592
Uh, you can turn it off now.

01:14.594 --> 01:18.630
It's sweet of you to say,
but I don't think I can.

Look at this cute picture
of Halley in the bath.

01:48.159 --> 01:49.558
Aw, that's great.

01:49.560 --> 01:51.160
Want me to send it to you?

01:51.162 --> 01:54.030
No, on your phone it's cute,
on my phone it's a crime.

01:55.466 --> 01:59.035
I also have
a pretty cute picture to share.

01:59.037 --> 02:00.369
What is that?

02:00.371 --> 02:02.872
An equation.

02:02.874 --> 02:03.873
Isn't it perfect?

02:03.875 --> 02:05.708
Sometimes I just stare at it,

02:05.710 --> 02:08.577
and I think "I can't believe
that came out of me."

02:08.579 --> 02:10.913
Well, since
we're sharing pictures,

02:10.914 --> 02:12.882
I have one to contribute.

02:12.884 --> 02:15.851
Please don't let it be
you and your dog in the bathtub.

02:15.853 --> 02:17.720
It's not.

02:17.722 --> 02:19.689
But don't swipe.

02:21.426 --> 02:23.092
What are we looking at here?

02:23.094 --> 02:25.428
Well, that's me
and a beautiful woman

02:25.430 --> 02:29.332
and my watch showing the time
as 2:30 in the morning.

02:30.301 --> 02:33.502
So, state's exhibit "A"?

02:33.504 --> 02:36.739
No. I met her at
the planetarium a few days ago,

02:36.741 --> 02:38.941
and she invited me
out for a drink.

02:38.943 --> 02:40.409
Oh, good for you. H-Hey,

02:40.411 --> 02:41.944
w-what's the Hindi word
for "dog"?

02:41.946 --> 02:43.913
<i>Kutta.</i>
You <i>kutta.</i>

02:43.915 --> 02:45.981
<i>Bow-bow.</i>

02:47.285 --> 02:49.185
That's Hindi for woof-woof.

02:50.288 --> 02:53.022
I am seeing her again tonight.

02:53.024 --> 02:54.457
You know, I also have
a date tonight.

02:54.459 --> 02:56.492
But don't worry,
it's not another woman.

02:56.494 --> 02:59.228
It's string theory.

02:59.230 --> 03:01.464
<i>Bow-bow.</i>

03:03.301 --> 03:06.535
Sorry, he's a
<i>kutta,</i> you're not.

03:10.341 --> 03:12.141
Hi.
Hello.

03:12.143 --> 03:13.476
What you doing?

03:13.478 --> 03:17.380
Oh, taking another picture
with my baby.

03:17.382 --> 03:19.382
Look how big he got.

03:20.685 --> 03:22.885
It's fun to see you
this excited.

03:22.887 --> 03:23.953
Aw, thank you, that's so...

03:23.955 --> 03:25.755
Don't sit there!
What, what?

03:25.757 --> 03:26.889
I, uh-- sorry.

03:26.891 --> 03:29.158
I-It's part of
my organization system.

03:29.160 --> 03:30.993
That's-that's where
those papers go.

03:30.995 --> 03:34.463
Okay. Um, how about if I just...

03:34.465 --> 03:35.765
slide this notebook...

03:35.767 --> 03:38.467
Eh...

03:38.469 --> 03:39.602
You know what, it's fine.

03:39.604 --> 03:40.870
I'll just be in the bedroom.

03:40.872 --> 03:43.372
No, no. Uh, this is
your apartment, too.

03:43.374 --> 03:44.907
Uh, look, I'll-I'll stop
for the night

03:44.909 --> 03:46.275
and clean this up.

03:46.277 --> 03:48.344
Well, that's very considerate,
Sheldon.

03:48.346 --> 03:49.812
I know.

03:49.814 --> 03:51.313
See, I'm trying
this new technique

03:51.315 --> 03:54.417
where I imagine how I would feel
in someone else's position.

03:54.419 --> 03:56.819
Y-You mean empathy?

03:56.821 --> 03:59.288
Oh, I thought I came up with it.

03:59.290 --> 04:02.358
Well, regardless,
I-I appreciate the effort.

04:02.360 --> 04:03.459
Thank you.

04:03.461 --> 04:04.760
It's really hard.

04:07.899 --> 04:09.265
Morning.

04:09.267 --> 04:11.133
Good morning.

04:11.135 --> 04:13.636
Aw, you didn't have
to cook me breakfast.

04:13.638 --> 04:15.504
Well, I wasn't sure
how I did last night,

04:15.506 --> 04:18.107
and I wanted to finish strong.

04:18.108 --> 04:20.242
You don't need to worry.

04:20.244 --> 04:21.543
Last night was great.

04:21.546 --> 04:24.346
Ah, well, you say that now,

04:24.348 --> 04:29.351
but wait until you taste this.

04:29.353 --> 04:31.854
Oh, my God, this is amazing.

04:31.856 --> 04:34.557
Which is why I keep an omelet
pan in the trunk of my car.

04:36.594 --> 04:38.661
Well, thank you, it's delicious.

04:38.663 --> 04:40.729
My husband never cooked for me.

04:40.731 --> 04:43.933
Oh, uh, y-you were married.

04:43.935 --> 04:48.137
Yeah. Well, technically,
I guess I still am.

04:48.139 --> 04:50.506
Is that "technically,"

04:50.508 --> 04:52.208
like, the paperwork
hasn't gone through,

04:52.210 --> 04:54.510
or "technically,"

04:54.512 --> 04:58.247
like, he's in the closet
watching us right now?

04:58.249 --> 05:01.450
No, no, we're separated.

05:01.452 --> 05:03.152
Do you mind if we talk
about something else?

05:03.154 --> 05:04.553
Of course.

05:04.555 --> 05:08.157
Uh, you know, my secret to
making great omelets is that

05:08.159 --> 05:09.859
I beat the egg whites
separately.

05:09.861 --> 05:12.628
Speaking of which, how long
have you been separated?

05:12.630 --> 05:15.231
About two weeks.

05:15.233 --> 05:19.235
That is not a lot of weeks.

05:19.237 --> 05:24.206
In fact, that's the bare minimum
to get to the plural "weeks."

05:24.208 --> 05:26.141
Doesn't matter.

05:26.143 --> 05:27.543
He moved out, I moved on.

05:27.545 --> 05:28.978
Oh. Good.

05:28.980 --> 05:31.180
Yeah, do you mind me asking
what he does for a living?

05:31.182 --> 05:32.615
He's a firefighter.

05:32.617 --> 05:34.383
Oh. Interesting.

05:34.385 --> 05:38.487
A potentially jealous man
who's handy with an ax.

05:38.489 --> 05:40.623
It's-it's okay, though.

05:40.625 --> 05:44.727
He's almost had two
weeks to cool down.

05:45.930 --> 05:48.364
Okay, the next drug is Romatrol.

05:48.366 --> 05:49.598
Oh, I know this one.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.933
We're actually
pushing it really hard.

05:50.935 --> 05:52.468
It treats mild dermatitis.

05:52.470 --> 05:54.937
Uh, correct. And who can it
be prescribed to?

05:54.939 --> 05:58.140
Adults and children
who have absolutely, for sure,

05:58.142 --> 06:00.276
stopped growing.

06:00.278 --> 06:01.677
Right again.

06:01.679 --> 06:03.546
And what are the side effects?

06:03.548 --> 06:05.447
Oh, shoot, shoot.

06:05.449 --> 06:06.916
Mm, remember the mnemonic.

06:06.918 --> 06:08.884
Ah-- GRAVY, yes. G-R-A-V-Y.

06:08.886 --> 06:12.187
Okay, gastric distress,
redness, anal leakage,

06:12.189 --> 06:16.091
vasculitis and yellow eyes.

06:16.093 --> 06:17.893
Oh, uh, so close.

06:17.895 --> 06:18.994
It's actually yellow discharge.

06:18.996 --> 06:21.063
Oh, right.

06:21.065 --> 06:24.233
That's why we went with "gravy."

06:24.235 --> 06:26.535
Hello.

06:26.537 --> 06:27.636
Hey.
Hi.

06:33.444 --> 06:36.779
He knows he doesn't
live here anymore, right?

06:36.781 --> 06:40.516
Maybe he's experiencing
memory loss because he took...

06:40.518 --> 06:42.851
Flaxitrite.
Yeah.

06:42.853 --> 06:45.254
- Thank you.
- Uh, Sheldon, what are you doing?

06:45.256 --> 06:47.556
Oh, I was just checking in
on my old room

06:47.558 --> 06:48.991
to see what you've done with it.

06:48.993 --> 06:50.659
Why?

06:50.661 --> 06:53.729
Well, I could use a place
to work in the evenings, and...

06:53.731 --> 06:55.631
No.
Well, it's just that

06:55.633 --> 06:57.433
there's not a lot of space in our apartment...
- No.

06:57.435 --> 06:59.335
Well, and I feel
like Amy's been having...

06:59.337 --> 07:00.402
No.

07:00.404 --> 07:01.370
And since you're not...

07:01.372 --> 07:02.738
No.

07:02.740 --> 07:03.806
It's...

07:03.808 --> 07:05.040
No.

07:07.011 --> 07:08.077
No.

07:08.879 --> 07:10.646
That is our room now,

07:10.648 --> 07:12.448
and we're gonna
turn it into a gym.

07:12.450 --> 07:14.249
Do you really expect me
to believe that?

07:15.052 --> 07:17.453
No.
No.

07:18.689 --> 07:20.122
So I guess what's bugging me

07:20.124 --> 07:21.957
is that they only broke up
13 days ago,

07:21.959 --> 07:23.792
and now I'm dating her.

07:23.794 --> 07:25.194
So, am I, like,
the good guy in my movie,

07:25.196 --> 07:26.695
or the bad guy in their movie?

07:26.697 --> 07:29.898
Pretty sure you're
the weird friend in our movie.

07:29.900 --> 07:32.301
I like her, okay?

07:32.303 --> 07:33.569
I just, I-I don't know
how I feel about

07:33.571 --> 07:35.604
being the third wheel
in a relationship.

07:35.606 --> 07:37.973
Says the guy in my bed
with my wife.

07:38.976 --> 07:41.443
Guys, I mean,
he's around, okay?

07:41.445 --> 07:43.479
He's apparently not happy
about the breakup,

07:43.481 --> 07:45.414
and based on the sweatpants
he left at her place,

07:45.416 --> 07:47.783
he's, like,
a medium to large man.

07:48.753 --> 07:51.220
Maybe those are
his "after the holiday" pants,

07:51.222 --> 07:52.921
like you have.

07:53.858 --> 07:55.257
Oh, no. I mean, do you think

07:55.259 --> 07:56.692
it's too soon
for her to be dating?

07:56.694 --> 07:58.027
If you and Bernadette broke up,

07:58.029 --> 07:59.294
like, how long would you wait?

07:59.296 --> 08:00.429
Oh, well, I don't even
want to think...

08:00.431 --> 08:01.597
Eight days.

08:03.334 --> 08:04.433
What?

08:04.435 --> 08:07.603
Two days to cry.
Six days to hit the gym.

08:07.605 --> 08:10.105
First of all,
you already look amazing.

08:10.107 --> 08:11.573
Aw, that's sweet.

08:11.575 --> 08:14.476
I'm gonna give him
an extra day of crying.

08:16.414 --> 08:19.281
The answer is still no.

08:21.352 --> 08:25.621
You can say we wouldn't know
you're here, but we'd know.

08:27.324 --> 08:29.391
Because you'd be here!

08:30.528 --> 08:33.761
So, who was that?

08:34.732 --> 08:36.432
I can't believe
you hung up on me!

08:38.436 --> 08:39.702
What the hell?

08:39.703 --> 08:41.703
What are you doing here?

08:41.706 --> 08:42.971
I am proving you wrong.

08:42.972 --> 08:44.339
I've been working
back there for hours.

08:44.341 --> 08:46.008
You had no idea.

08:46.010 --> 08:48.077
Do something.

08:48.079 --> 08:51.346
What the hell?
What are you doing here?

08:51.348 --> 08:52.948
I-I am trying to respect Amy.

08:52.950 --> 08:54.216
Okay, look,

08:54.218 --> 08:56.118
you have an office at work.
Why don't you go there?

08:56.120 --> 08:58.954
I can't go to the office every
time I have a brilliant thought.

08:58.956 --> 09:00.055
I'd basically be living there.

09:00.057 --> 09:02.191
Sounds good, do that.
Yeah...

09:02.193 --> 09:04.593
No. No, the campus
isn't safe at night.

09:04.595 --> 09:06.662
There's raccoons and
undergrads just walking around

09:06.664 --> 09:08.764
like they own the place.

09:08.766 --> 09:10.099
Look.

09:10.101 --> 09:11.667
I need somewhere to work
in the evenings.

09:11.669 --> 09:13.102
You have a space
you aren't using.

09:13.104 --> 09:16.572
Just take a look at my proposal.

09:17.641 --> 09:18.774
What is this?

09:18.776 --> 09:19.742
A rental agreement.

09:19.744 --> 09:21.443
I will only use
the room for work.

09:21.445 --> 09:23.445
I-I won't sleep here,
I won't eat your food,

09:23.447 --> 09:24.680
I won't even use your bathroom.

09:24.682 --> 09:27.816
So you can just walk in any
time of the day or night?

09:27.818 --> 09:29.351
Well, he does that now.

09:29.353 --> 09:31.086
At least this way
we'll get paid.

09:33.424 --> 09:35.924
I am Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali,

09:35.926 --> 09:38.827
and thank you
for taking a walk with me...

09:41.499 --> 09:43.198
...through the stars.

09:44.735 --> 09:48.003
I-I think that one was too long.

09:48.005 --> 09:50.005
Yeah, you're right.
I totally felt it.

09:50.007 --> 09:51.106
Should we, uh, run it again?

09:51.108 --> 09:53.175
Please, God, no.

09:53.177 --> 09:56.011
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:56.013 --> 09:57.980
Can I help you?

09:57.982 --> 09:59.815
Which one of you
is Rajesh Koothrappali?

09:59.817 --> 10:01.517
Really? You're not sure

10:01.519 --> 10:04.620
which one of us is
Rajesh Koothrappali?

10:04.622 --> 10:09.224
I am. I was just trying
not to be racist.

10:11.195 --> 10:13.595
I'm Nell's husband.

10:16.634 --> 10:18.033
Oh, uh...

10:18.035 --> 10:20.302
h-here's the thing--
I didn't know

10:20.304 --> 10:22.538
that she was married
until after...

10:22.540 --> 10:23.906
After what?

10:26.010 --> 10:28.577
I'm...

10:28.579 --> 10:30.279
I'm really sorry.

10:30.281 --> 10:32.114
Well, that doesn't
make me feel better.

10:32.116 --> 10:33.882
Wh-What would make
you feel better?

10:33.884 --> 10:35.517
I want you to stop
seeing my wife.

10:35.519 --> 10:37.052
Done. Nice to
meet you. Bye.

10:39.123 --> 10:41.623
What am I gonna do?

10:47.531 --> 10:52.034
Hey, buddy,
do-do you want to talk?

10:52.036 --> 10:55.804
I thought we were
gonna start a family.

10:55.806 --> 10:58.774
Next thing I
know, it's over.

11:00.377 --> 11:02.110
It's gonna be okay.

11:02.112 --> 11:03.612
How is it gonna be okay?

11:03.614 --> 11:06.982
You're sleeping
with my wife.

11:06.984 --> 11:10.285
I mean, besides that.

11:16.459 --> 11:18.225
Can I get you anything?

11:18.227 --> 11:19.760
A glass of water?

11:19.762 --> 11:22.396
A laser show?

11:22.398 --> 11:24.064
No, thank you.
Oh, good.

11:24.066 --> 11:26.901
'Cause I don't, I don't
even know how to turn it on.

11:26.903 --> 11:28.168
I'm sorry.

11:28.170 --> 11:31.038
I shouldn't
have come here.

11:31.040 --> 11:34.542
I guess I just wanted to see
who she replaced me with.

11:34.544 --> 11:36.343
Don't say that.

11:36.345 --> 11:37.978
What you two had
was special.

11:37.980 --> 11:39.446
No one can replace you.

11:39.448 --> 11:40.581
Did she say that?

11:40.583 --> 11:42.049
No.

11:43.886 --> 11:45.352
I should go, right?

11:45.354 --> 11:46.554
Stay.

11:46.556 --> 11:49.623
Okay, I'll
call you later.

11:49.625 --> 11:51.859
Look, if it makes you
feel any better,

11:51.861 --> 11:53.794
I barely know her.

11:53.796 --> 11:56.230
And she had sex with you?

11:56.232 --> 11:59.199
Nell tells me
you're a fireman.

11:59.201 --> 12:00.668
What's that like?

12:02.000 --> 12:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here

12:09.145 --> 12:11.979
Okay, I-I-I'm really
uncomfortable

12:11.981 --> 12:13.280
with him back in that room.

12:13.282 --> 12:15.249
Why? He hasn't made
a peep all day.

12:15.251 --> 12:16.216
Y-Y-You don't get it.

12:16.218 --> 12:18.152
All the years
that we lived together,

12:18.154 --> 12:20.387
he drove me crazy
the whole time.

12:20.389 --> 12:22.590
And now he's not.

12:22.592 --> 12:25.392
Exactly.

12:26.128 --> 12:27.595
D-Don't look at me like that.

12:27.597 --> 12:29.897
It-it-it means he did it
on purpose.

12:29.899 --> 12:31.966
It was a choice.

12:31.968 --> 12:34.835
That-That's like finding out
Godzilla could've had Arby's

12:34.837 --> 12:37.204
instead of Tokyo.

12:37.206 --> 12:40.407
I don't think
they have Arby's in Japan.

12:40.409 --> 12:42.876
Not my point.

12:44.547 --> 12:46.614
Sheldon.

12:46.616 --> 12:48.015
Sheldon!

12:48.017 --> 12:52.252
I'm sorry. Am I
being too loud?

12:52.254 --> 12:55.222
No, you're being perfect
and you know it.

12:55.224 --> 12:59.159
Would you like me to be a
less considerate tenant?

12:59.161 --> 13:01.528
No. Yes. What...?

13:01.530 --> 13:03.030
Stop messing with me!

13:05.668 --> 13:07.301
Hey, I was wrong.

13:07.303 --> 13:10.404
There's an Arby's in Okinawa.

13:14.744 --> 13:16.810
He was best friends
with her older brother,

13:16.812 --> 13:18.078
but he didn't
even notice her.

13:18.080 --> 13:19.346
And then years afterward,

13:19.348 --> 13:21.782
they randomly bumped into
each other at the DMV.

13:21.784 --> 13:23.917
Two hours later,
they were in love.

13:23.919 --> 13:28.622
You can really see the sparkle
in his license photo.

13:28.624 --> 13:30.791
He told you all this
at the planetarium?

13:30.793 --> 13:32.493
No, no, we went
to House of Pies.

13:32.495 --> 13:34.061
He got banana cream.
I got coconut.

13:34.063 --> 13:35.863
We did halfsies.

13:35.865 --> 13:38.832
You did pie halfsies
with another man?

13:38.834 --> 13:41.969
You mean other than you?

13:43.139 --> 13:45.105
Yeah.

13:45.107 --> 13:48.308
I feel bad for
him, Bernie.

13:48.310 --> 13:49.643
He's a, he's a good guy.

13:49.645 --> 13:51.145
Well, if you're uncomfortable
with it,

13:51.147 --> 13:52.980
maybe stop sleeping
with his wife.

13:52.982 --> 13:54.281
I don't think the sex
is the problem.

13:54.283 --> 13:56.850
I know for a fact
I was just okay.

13:57.953 --> 13:59.186
For the record, I'm the one

13:59.188 --> 14:01.188
who introduced you
to House of Pies.

14:03.392 --> 14:05.192
Sheldon?

14:05.194 --> 14:06.794
Oh, Leonard.

14:06.796 --> 14:09.797
Sorry, I just, I had
to get out of there.

14:09.799 --> 14:11.331
What did he do now?

14:11.333 --> 14:13.467
Nothing. He's being a dream.

14:15.204 --> 14:16.603
Don't give me that look.

14:16.605 --> 14:18.472
That's how Penny looked at me.
I'm not crazy.

14:18.474 --> 14:21.008
Penny and I have the same
"You're crazy" look?

14:21.010 --> 14:22.476
That's kind of sweet.

14:22.478 --> 14:26.213
I know how to deal with
Sheldon being Sheldon,

14:26.215 --> 14:29.483
but Sheldon being a-a
rational, thoughtful person?

14:29.485 --> 14:31.585
I'm clueless.
I-It's like

14:31.587 --> 14:33.954
when my mom called last year
to sing happy birthday

14:33.956 --> 14:36.623
and I-I just threw up.

14:37.493 --> 14:38.892
Well, if it gets
to be too much,

14:38.894 --> 14:40.828
you can always send him
back over here.

14:40.830 --> 14:42.196
I made a deal with him,

14:42.198 --> 14:43.664
and besides, that
wouldn't be fair to you.

14:43.666 --> 14:45.399
Well, actually, I miss him.

14:45.401 --> 14:46.400
He's been over there a lot.

14:46.402 --> 14:49.570
Well, great.
Tell him he can come back.

14:49.572 --> 14:51.538
I can't. He's thinking of me
and my feelings

14:51.540 --> 14:53.107
and trying to be respectful.

14:53.109 --> 14:55.843
That's what he's doing
to me, too, the jerk!

14:56.345 --> 14:58.545
Stop that.

14:58.547 --> 15:03.751
Hey, your mad look and Sheldon's
constipated look are the same.

15:10.459 --> 15:11.859
This is nice.

15:11.861 --> 15:13.026
It is.

15:16.232 --> 15:17.898
She used to kiss me
like that.

15:18.701 --> 15:20.267
You okay?

15:20.269 --> 15:24.204
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry.

15:24.206 --> 15:26.406
Yeah.

15:28.811 --> 15:30.544
Oh, God,
I'm so alone.

15:30.546 --> 15:32.246
Sorry, I can't do this.

15:32.248 --> 15:34.248
What's going on?

15:34.250 --> 15:36.483
I met Oliver the other day.

15:36.485 --> 15:39.219
Wait, you tracked down
my husband?

15:39.221 --> 15:40.854
No, that would be weird.

15:40.856 --> 15:43.690
He tracked me down, then we
spent the evening together.

15:44.827 --> 15:46.360
I don't believe this.

15:46.362 --> 15:49.963
He-he only did it
because he cares about you.

15:49.965 --> 15:52.900
No, he did it because he's
possessive and jealous.

15:52.902 --> 15:54.101
Really?
I didn't get that at all.

15:54.103 --> 15:56.103
He made me feel
very comfortable.

15:56.105 --> 15:58.705
Well, I'm glad you
two hit it off.

15:58.707 --> 16:02.075
You know, I don't think that
you're being very fair to him.

16:02.077 --> 16:04.011
You're taking his side?

16:04.013 --> 16:06.480
No, but I should point out
that he did offer

16:06.482 --> 16:09.616
to go to counseling, so at least
one of you is trying.

16:09.618 --> 16:12.519
You're crazier than he is.

16:12.521 --> 16:15.422
I'll tell you what, just
give him one more chance

16:15.424 --> 16:16.523
and if it doesn't work out,

16:16.525 --> 16:19.526
I'll be happy to keep
sleeping with you.

16:19.528 --> 16:21.995
You would?

16:23.766 --> 16:25.833
Either way, you've
got yourself a fella.

16:25.835 --> 16:27.935
Like, how nice is that?

16:32.141 --> 16:33.640
Hey, Sheldon.

16:36.612 --> 16:38.312
Hello.
Hey.

16:38.314 --> 16:41.582
So, your contract provides
for a three-day trial period,

16:41.584 --> 16:43.917
and I don't think
this is working out.

16:43.919 --> 16:45.452
So, to put it
in legal terms,

16:45.454 --> 16:47.721
the party of the first part
would like

16:47.723 --> 16:50.791
the party of the second part
to get out.

16:50.793 --> 16:53.694
What time does the
trial period end?

16:53.696 --> 16:55.429
12:00, noon.

16:55.431 --> 16:58.498
Yeah-- what does
it say after that?

17:01.804 --> 17:04.438
Eastern Standard Time.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.641
That was three hours ago.

17:07.643 --> 17:09.376
And, uh, since you
didn't exercise

17:09.377 --> 17:13.780
your right to revoke, I
exercised my right to extend,

17:13.781 --> 17:18.318
triggering this long-form
rental agreement...

17:19.454 --> 17:21.888
...of which you're
already in violation.

17:21.891 --> 17:24.691
This is just
a-a bunch of paper.

17:24.693 --> 17:25.992
You can't enforce this.

17:25.994 --> 17:28.996
Hire a lawyer.
Let's find out.

17:28.998 --> 17:31.698
This is not happening.

17:31.700 --> 17:32.900
Be that as it may,

17:32.902 --> 17:34.968
page nine says that
you have to provide me

17:34.970 --> 17:38.472
with lemon-flavored sparkling
waters, so... chop-chop.

17:43.712 --> 17:44.811
Hey, how'd it go?

17:44.813 --> 17:46.980
Well, apparently
he's not leaving

17:46.982 --> 17:50.284
and I have to go get him
sparkling water.

17:50.286 --> 17:51.985
Why are you smiling?

17:51.987 --> 17:55.489
I don't know.
It just feels right.

18:03.599 --> 18:05.399
...to the stars.

18:09.572 --> 18:10.838
Hey.

18:10.840 --> 18:13.574
Hey, buddy.

18:13.576 --> 18:14.775
I talked to Nell.

18:14.777 --> 18:16.377
She was pretty upset
after you left.

18:16.379 --> 18:19.713
Yeah, I'm sorry.
No. No, no, no.

18:19.715 --> 18:21.382
She told me that you said
something so creepy

18:21.384 --> 18:24.151
that I seemed great
in comparison.

18:24.153 --> 18:26.086
I know exactly what it was.

18:26.088 --> 18:27.254
I... no, actually,

18:27.256 --> 18:28.622
there was a couple of
things it could've been.

18:28.624 --> 18:31.992
Whichever one it
was, it was creepy.

18:31.994 --> 18:33.661
Anyway, uh, I went over
to comfort her,

18:33.663 --> 18:37.197
and we talked, and I think we're
gonna give it another chance.

18:37.199 --> 18:40.100
I am so happy for you!
Hey-hey-hey.

18:40.102 --> 18:42.703
Hey, uh, we should celebrate.

18:42.705 --> 18:43.804
House of Pies?

18:43.806 --> 18:45.439
You know it.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.144
Should we invite Nell?

18:50.146 --> 18:52.246
- Do we have to?
- Nah.
