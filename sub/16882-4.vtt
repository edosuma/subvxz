WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.003
(gunfire, explosions on TV)

00:03.037 --> 00:05.706
(heavy metal music playing)

00:05.739 --> 00:07.575
>> EDGAR: Jimmy!

00:07.608 --> 00:09.043
What's happening?!

00:09.077 --> 00:11.412
What's happening?!

00:11.445 --> 00:13.214
What are you wearing?

00:13.247 --> 00:14.882
>> JIMMY: It's your war costume.

00:14.915 --> 00:15.983
>> EDGAR: It's not a costume!

00:16.016 --> 00:16.984
And why are you wearing it?

00:17.017 --> 00:17.985
>> JIMMY: They have a killer

00:18.018 --> 00:19.720
veterans' discount at the diner.

00:19.753 --> 00:20.854
>> EDGAR: Seriously? How much?

00:20.888 --> 00:21.855
>> GRETCHEN: Why'd you let me

00:21.889 --> 00:23.091
sleep?

00:23.124 --> 00:24.825
>> JIMMY: Okay, there is an

00:24.858 --> 00:26.694
alarm on every phone.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.096
So, literally everybody can be

00:28.129 --> 00:29.230
self-reliant on this.

00:29.263 --> 00:30.231
>> GRETCHEN: You went to

00:30.264 --> 00:31.232
breakfast?

00:31.265 --> 00:32.233
>> JIMMY: Yes.

00:32.266 --> 00:33.234
>> GRETCHEN: You went to

00:33.267 --> 00:34.235
breakfast with Killian?

00:34.268 --> 00:35.236
>> JIMMY: No, I didn't go to

00:35.269 --> 00:36.270
breakfast with Killian.

00:36.304 --> 00:37.271
I went to breakfast with my

00:37.305 --> 00:38.272
book.

00:38.306 --> 00:39.273
Killian just happened to be

00:39.307 --> 00:40.274
sitting across from me,

00:40.308 --> 00:41.275
prattling on about the fourth

00:41.309 --> 00:42.276
grade.

00:42.310 --> 00:43.277
>> KILLIAN: Seventh grade.

00:43.311 --> 00:44.278
>> GRETCHEN: Listen, Jimmy, I'm

00:44.312 --> 00:45.279
only gonna say this once.

00:45.313 --> 00:46.280
You and me, we could end

00:46.314 --> 00:47.381
tomorrow, who knows, but in the

00:47.415 --> 00:48.382
meantime, if there is even a

00:48.416 --> 00:50.118
remote possibility of breakfast

00:50.151 --> 00:51.919
and you don't wake me up, I will

00:51.952 --> 00:53.020
never touch your dick again with

00:53.053 --> 00:54.021
any part of my body.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.022
At least you brought me

00:55.055 --> 00:56.023
leftovers.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.024
>> JIMMY: Oh, actually, those

00:57.057 --> 00:58.759
were for... Yeah, enjoy those.

00:58.792 --> 00:59.760
>> EDGAR: He wore my uniform for

00:59.793 --> 01:01.462
a discount.

01:01.495 --> 01:02.596
>> GRETCHEN: What about the kid?

01:02.630 --> 01:03.597
>> JIMMY: You know how busy that

01:03.631 --> 01:04.865
place gets on weekends?

01:04.898 --> 01:06.767
A soldier reunited with his fat

01:06.800 --> 01:07.935
little son?

01:07.968 --> 01:08.936
>> GRETCHEN: Hella smart.

01:08.969 --> 01:09.937
>> JIMMY: Oh, that reminds me.

01:09.970 --> 01:11.939
Yours came to $18.23.

01:11.972 --> 01:13.274
We'll just call it $20.

01:13.307 --> 01:14.275
>> KILLIAN: I don't have any

01:14.308 --> 01:15.276
money.

01:15.309 --> 01:16.277
>> JIMMY: Go and steal it from

01:16.310 --> 01:17.278
your mom's purse like a normal

01:17.311 --> 01:20.581
boy.

01:20.614 --> 01:21.749
>> EDGAR: The last time I wore

01:21.782 --> 01:23.551
that uniform during active duty,

01:23.584 --> 01:25.486
we were doing house checks.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.788
A kid, 16, maybe 17, heard us...

01:27.821 --> 01:28.956
>> JIMMY: This is a really hard

01:28.989 --> 01:29.957
level.

01:29.990 --> 01:31.325
>> EDGAR: Oh, I'm sorry.

01:31.359 --> 01:32.426
I'll stop talking about my

01:32.460 --> 01:33.961
actual war experiences so you

01:33.994 --> 01:35.763
can play your war video game.

01:35.796 --> 01:36.764
>> JIMMY: Thank you.

01:36.797 --> 01:37.765
>> GRETCHEN: Jimmy.

01:37.798 --> 01:38.799
>> JIMMY: Oh, come on, his

01:38.832 --> 01:40.401
stories are super-depressing.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.435
>> GRETCHEN: I'll listen to your

01:41.469 --> 01:42.636
stories.

01:42.670 --> 01:43.971
>> EDGAR: Thanks.

01:44.004 --> 01:45.473
One day I found four stray dogs

01:45.506 --> 01:46.674
fighting over a dead baby...

01:46.707 --> 01:48.309
>> GRETCHEN: Eject!

01:48.342 --> 01:49.677
Sorry, bud.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.145
>> EDGAR: That's okay.

01:51.179 --> 01:52.980
Actually, I-I'm speaking at the

01:53.013 --> 01:54.315
dedication of a new veterans'

01:54.348 --> 01:55.483
memorial today if you guys want

01:55.516 --> 01:57.351
to come...?

01:57.385 --> 01:59.287
>> LINDSAY: Oh, my God!

01:59.320 --> 02:01.021
The worst drive over here!

02:01.054 --> 02:02.823
(sighs)

02:02.856 --> 02:04.292
What?

02:04.325 --> 02:05.626
Oh, I had my jaw wired shut, so

02:05.659 --> 02:06.627
I don't put anything bad in my

02:06.660 --> 02:07.628
mouth.

02:07.661 --> 02:08.629
>> GRETCHEN: But putting bad

02:08.662 --> 02:09.630
stuff in your mouth is kind of

02:09.663 --> 02:10.631
your thing.

02:10.664 --> 02:11.632
>> LINDSAY: I know!

02:11.665 --> 02:12.633
>> GRETCHEN: Thanks for driving

02:12.666 --> 02:13.634
me to work. Bye.

02:13.667 --> 02:14.702
>> LINDSAY: Bye, Jimmy.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.704
>> JIMMY: Bye.

02:16.737 --> 02:17.705
>> EDGAR: Could you take off my

02:17.738 --> 02:19.006
uniform now?

02:19.039 --> 02:20.541
>> JIMMY: Oh, damn it!

02:20.574 --> 02:23.877
(groans)

02:23.911 --> 02:26.214
War is hell.

02:33.153 --> 02:36.390
>> * I'm gonna leave you anyway

02:36.424 --> 02:39.493
I'm gonna leave you anyway

02:39.527 --> 02:41.895
Gonna leave you anyway. *

02:46.934 --> 02:49.837
>> SAM: The craftsman movement

02:49.870 --> 02:53.574
was a protest against the

02:53.607 --> 02:55.643
dehumanizing aspects of the

02:55.676 --> 02:57.511
Industrial Revolution.

02:57.545 --> 03:00.481
Irony is building these shits

03:00.514 --> 03:02.082
was so expensive, couldn't no

03:02.115 --> 03:03.150
laborers even dream of living in

03:03.183 --> 03:04.151
one.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.152
>> GRETCHEN: Do you just want to

03:05.185 --> 03:06.320
send me the Wikipedia link?

03:06.354 --> 03:07.321
What am I doing here?!

03:07.355 --> 03:08.322
>> SAM: I need media coverage on

03:08.356 --> 03:09.323
this bitch, bitch.

03:09.357 --> 03:10.324
>> GRETCHEN: What are you

03:10.358 --> 03:11.325
thinking?

03:11.359 --> 03:12.326
>> SAM: Specifically, I want to

03:12.360 --> 03:13.694
get the house featured in

03:13.727 --> 03:15.396
Curbed, Apartment Therapy, or

03:15.429 --> 03:17.498
Black Dwell.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.599
>> GRETCHEN: What's Black Dwell?

03:18.632 --> 03:19.767
>> SAM: It's like Dwell, but for

03:19.800 --> 03:21.269
black people.

03:21.302 --> 03:22.903
No... you're right.

03:22.936 --> 03:25.606
Go for regular Dwell.

03:25.639 --> 03:28.041
I believe in you.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.047
>> HONEY NUTZ: On-on purpose?

03:34.081 --> 03:35.048
>> SHITSTAIN: You ain't break

03:35.082 --> 03:36.049
your jaw or nothing?

03:36.083 --> 03:37.050
>> LINDSAY: Nope.

03:37.084 --> 03:38.051
>> HONEY NUTZ: Isn't your

03:38.085 --> 03:39.052
husband mad that you can't open

03:39.086 --> 03:40.053
your mouth?

03:40.087 --> 03:41.054
>> LINDSAY: Paul only likes

03:41.088 --> 03:42.055
hand jobs.

03:42.089 --> 03:43.056
>> SHITSTAIN: But you have a

03:43.090 --> 03:44.057
huge mouth!

03:44.091 --> 03:45.058
>> HONEY NUTZ: Seriously.

03:45.092 --> 03:46.059
You're like a crocodile.

03:46.093 --> 03:47.060
>> LINDSAY: When I played field

03:47.094 --> 03:48.061
hockey, they had to melt two

03:48.095 --> 03:49.530
mouth guards together.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.531
>> HONEY NUTZ: This fool Paul

03:50.564 --> 03:51.565
know that if you lose weight,

03:51.599 --> 03:54.101
that ass gonna shrink, too?

03:54.134 --> 03:55.436
>> LINDSAY: Mm, Paul isn't an

03:55.469 --> 03:58.806
ass man.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.107
>> HONEY NUTZ: Look, why would

04:00.140 --> 04:01.709
this prick buy the car if he

04:01.742 --> 04:02.943
ain't even appreciate the

04:02.976 --> 04:05.413
features?

04:05.446 --> 04:07.114
>> SAM: My piano teacher growing

04:07.147 --> 04:09.583
up had a craftsman.

04:09.617 --> 04:11.485
I used to sit on that bench and

04:11.519 --> 04:15.423
pray, "God, please, let me have

04:15.456 --> 04:17.391
a house like this some day.

04:17.425 --> 04:18.492
Also, let me figure out this

04:18.526 --> 04:20.093
piece of shit 'Maple Leaf Rag.'"

04:20.127 --> 04:21.094
>> GRETCHEN: It's one of the

04:21.128 --> 04:22.095
hardest rags.

04:22.129 --> 04:23.096
>> SAM: This house really means

04:23.130 --> 04:24.097
something to me, Gretch.

04:24.131 --> 04:25.098
>> GRETCHEN: Yeah, buddy.

04:25.132 --> 04:26.099
It means you've worked hard and

04:26.133 --> 04:27.100
you made it.

04:27.134 --> 04:28.101
>> SAM: No, it means I'm gonna

04:28.135 --> 04:30.103
get so laid.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.138
House like this, bitches be

04:31.171 --> 04:32.606
delivering the pussy.

04:32.640 --> 04:33.607
>> GRETCHEN: "Delivering the

04:33.641 --> 04:34.608
pussy"?

04:34.642 --> 04:35.609
>> SAM: Oh, yeah.

04:35.643 --> 04:36.644
I send out a quick group text.

04:36.677 --> 04:37.978
"Hey, girl?" or "What's

04:38.011 --> 04:39.747
crackin'?" or "You want to come

04:39.780 --> 04:41.014
see my new architecturally

04:41.048 --> 04:42.015
significant house?"

04:42.049 --> 04:43.283
Then ding-dong, there it is.

04:43.317 --> 04:44.284
>> GRETCHEN: Okay.

04:44.318 --> 04:45.285
>> SAM: Piping fresh at your

04:45.319 --> 04:46.354
door in 30 minutes or less!

04:46.387 --> 04:47.355
>> GRETCHEN: All right.

04:47.388 --> 04:48.422
>> SAM: I get it, though.

04:48.456 --> 04:49.423
You know, dating is scary for

04:49.457 --> 04:50.858
women.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.292
Like, what if for once they

04:52.326 --> 04:54.595
said, "No, you come to my house

04:54.628 --> 04:55.796
for it this time," and I didn't

04:55.829 --> 04:56.964
come?

04:56.997 --> 04:57.965
>> GRETCHEN: Would you come?

04:57.998 --> 04:58.966
>> SAM: Hell, no!

04:58.999 --> 05:00.200
Look at my house.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.336
These girls are afraid that if

05:02.370 --> 05:03.837
they opened up a pussy dine-in-

05:03.871 --> 05:05.806
only joint, no one would come.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.341
Their tables be empty, have to

05:07.375 --> 05:08.776
offer Groupons and shit.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.511
So they keep delivering it.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.145
>> GRETCHEN: All right, and I'm

05:12.179 --> 05:13.146
out.

05:13.180 --> 05:14.815
Great house, dum-dum.

05:14.848 --> 05:15.816
I'm gonna go back to the office

05:15.849 --> 05:17.017
and make some calls.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.352
>> SAM: You do that, bitch.

05:18.386 --> 05:19.953
Hey, and tell Black Dwell my

05:19.987 --> 05:21.121
subscription shows up crazy late

05:21.154 --> 05:22.322
every month!

05:22.356 --> 05:23.724
Get a free month or some shit!

05:23.757 --> 05:24.725
(crowd clapping)

05:24.758 --> 05:25.726
>> COUNCILMAN: Some people think

05:25.759 --> 05:28.362
Los Angeles is out of touch.

05:28.396 --> 05:29.463
Too obsessed with the

05:29.497 --> 05:30.698
entertainment industry to care

05:30.731 --> 05:32.566
about national issues.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.201
But with this memorial to our

05:34.234 --> 05:35.869
nation's heroes, carved by our

05:35.903 --> 05:38.472
very own Rumer Willis, we will

05:38.506 --> 05:39.540
demonstrate just how wrong they

05:39.573 --> 05:41.942
are.

05:44.878 --> 05:47.080
And now, one of Los Angeles's

05:47.114 --> 05:49.650
own brave servicemen, Edgar

05:49.683 --> 05:52.052
Quintero.

05:55.255 --> 05:56.690
>> EDGAR: Thank you, Councilman

05:56.724 --> 05:59.560
Jim Burton.

05:59.593 --> 06:02.229
The process of readjusting for

06:02.262 --> 06:05.499
a soldier is a difficult one.

06:05.533 --> 06:08.268
In war, you exist on a higher

06:08.301 --> 06:10.604
plane of awareness.

06:10.638 --> 06:12.506
But not in a fun, hippie way.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.608
You're aware of a window opening

06:14.642 --> 06:17.678
a block away, a pair of socks

06:17.711 --> 06:19.179
being hung on a laundry line

06:19.212 --> 06:20.347
right behind you.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.950
You're strung tight as a violin.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.251
And when you come home, that's

06:24.284 --> 06:25.252
when shit gets real.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.421
>> COUNCILMAN: Thank for your

06:27.455 --> 06:30.424
service, soldier.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.025
And now, L.A.'s very own

06:32.059 --> 06:33.026
Zig Zags!

06:33.060 --> 06:34.027
Huh?

06:34.061 --> 06:37.798
(crowd cheering)

06:37.831 --> 06:40.067
*

06:57.184 --> 07:00.253
>> These pricks.

07:00.287 --> 07:01.922
They just trot us out there so

07:01.955 --> 07:03.156
they can feel better about

07:03.190 --> 07:05.058
themselves for a second before

07:05.092 --> 07:06.460
they go back to seeing us as

07:06.494 --> 07:07.461
disposable meat.

07:07.495 --> 07:10.430
(Edgar snorts)

07:10.464 --> 07:13.333
>> EDGAR: Edgar Quintero.

07:13.366 --> 07:14.902
6th Battalion, 8th Infantry.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.336
>> TOMMY: Tommy Boden.

07:16.369 --> 07:17.605
I don't identify by my troop

07:17.638 --> 07:19.306
anymore.

07:19.339 --> 07:21.675
It's just Tommy now.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.413
>> EDGAR: Oh, let me help you.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.981
>> TOMMY: I can do it!

07:28.015 --> 07:29.449
(sighs)

07:29.483 --> 07:30.450
Sorry.

07:30.484 --> 07:31.619
>> EDGAR: It's okay.

07:31.652 --> 07:34.154
(flicks lighter)

07:34.187 --> 07:37.024
>> TOMMY: I guess I got to get

07:37.057 --> 07:39.192
used to life without a wing now.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.494
>> EDGAR: Yeah, man.

07:40.528 --> 07:41.995
That's rough.

07:42.029 --> 07:43.196
>> EDGAR: Hey, listen, some of

07:43.230 --> 07:44.297
my troopmates are going to get

07:44.331 --> 07:45.966
a bite.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.300
If you want, you should come;

07:47.334 --> 07:49.670
we'd love to hear your stories.

07:56.677 --> 07:57.711
(Gretchen whoops)

07:57.745 --> 07:58.646
>> JIMMY: Oh, come on!

07:58.679 --> 08:00.213
>> GRETCHEN: That is 301

08:00.247 --> 08:01.815
exactly, so you have to go down

08:01.849 --> 08:04.184
on me for five hours and one

08:04.217 --> 08:05.185
minute.

08:05.218 --> 08:06.019
>> JIMMY: In a row?

08:06.053 --> 08:06.887
I'll die.

08:06.920 --> 08:07.855
>> GRETCHEN: Pussy.

08:07.888 --> 08:08.989
All right, three sessions, hour

08:09.022 --> 08:10.524
and a halfish each.

08:10.558 --> 08:13.026
>> JIMMY: That's doable.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.227
God, day drinking's the best.

08:14.261 --> 08:15.362
>> GRETCHEN: Day drinking is the

08:15.395 --> 08:16.564
best. (laughs)

08:16.597 --> 08:17.565
Aren't we lucky we're both in

08:17.598 --> 08:18.799
professions where we can day

08:18.832 --> 08:19.833
drink?

08:19.867 --> 08:20.701
>> JIMMY: Are you in a

08:20.734 --> 08:21.535
profession where you can day

08:21.569 --> 08:22.235
drink?

08:22.269 --> 08:23.036
>> GRETCHEN: They all are if you

08:23.070 --> 08:23.971
want it bad enough.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.205
What do you say we get one of

08:25.238 --> 08:26.339
those sessions out of the way

08:26.373 --> 08:27.374
right now?

08:27.407 --> 08:28.341
>> JIMMY: That sounds good.

08:28.375 --> 08:29.643
If we leave now, we can probably

08:29.677 --> 08:31.011
be at my place in 30 minutes or

08:31.044 --> 08:32.345
less.

08:32.379 --> 08:33.881
>> GRETCHEN: Actually, let's go

08:33.914 --> 08:34.982
to my place.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.083
>> JIMMY: You-you-- sorry, your

08:36.116 --> 08:37.317
place? Do you have a place?

08:37.350 --> 08:38.986
>> GRETCHEN: Do you think I just

08:39.019 --> 08:40.053
materialize out of the ether

08:40.087 --> 08:41.088
whenever you want me?

08:41.121 --> 08:42.255
>> JIMMY: No...

08:42.289 --> 08:43.156
>> GRETCHEN: That I exist in

08:43.190 --> 08:44.057
some suspended state of

08:44.091 --> 08:45.225
crypto-animation only made

08:45.258 --> 08:47.060
material when your balls tingle?

08:47.094 --> 08:48.328
>> JIMMY: No.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.196
Not literally.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.397
I'm used to seeing you at my

08:50.430 --> 08:51.231
house.

08:51.264 --> 08:52.265
>> GRETCHEN: You are in rare

08:52.299 --> 08:53.200
form lately.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.101
>> JIMMY: What?

08:54.134 --> 08:55.836
Edgar and his army perks.

08:55.869 --> 08:56.704
Killian, whose name who you

08:56.737 --> 08:57.871
constantly forget.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.072
Me who didn't even merit

08:59.106 --> 09:00.207
breakfast.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.909
Are you aware that you only want

09:01.942 --> 09:03.043
people in your life on your

09:03.076 --> 09:03.911
terms?

09:03.944 --> 09:04.912
>> JIMMY: Yes.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.079
>> GRETCHEN: Well, stop.

09:06.113 --> 09:07.114
Your self-awareness on this

09:07.147 --> 09:08.415
means nothing, if you don't

09:08.448 --> 09:09.416
change it.

09:09.449 --> 09:10.718
>> JIMMY: Okay, fine.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.219
How do I start?

09:12.252 --> 09:15.255
>> GRETCHEN: Well, first step,

09:15.288 --> 09:17.457
Jimmy... I need you to come eat

09:17.490 --> 09:19.192
me out in my apartment.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.293
(Jimmy scoffs)

09:20.327 --> 09:21.361
>> BARFLY: I'll do it.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.395
>> GRETCHEN: See?!

09:22.429 --> 09:23.964
I am a wanted woman.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.565
What do you say, buddy?

09:25.599 --> 09:26.967
>> JIMMY: Well, I-I-I wouldn't

09:27.000 --> 09:28.568
want to cockblock this fella.

09:28.602 --> 09:29.469
>> BARFLY: Yay!

09:29.502 --> 09:30.971
>> JIMMY: But all right.

09:31.004 --> 09:33.774
Let's go.

09:33.807 --> 09:36.176
Sit down, man.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.781
(Gretchen chuckles)

09:40.814 --> 09:41.715
>> GRETCHEN: I didn't have a

09:41.749 --> 09:44.051
chance to tidy up.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.086
Cute, huh?

09:46.119 --> 09:47.587
I'm not much of a cleaner.

09:47.621 --> 09:49.422
>> JIMMY: You're not much of a

09:49.456 --> 09:50.590
human.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.092
>> GRETCHEN: Oh, calm down.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.494
I'll be right back.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.333
(cat meows)

10:00.367 --> 10:01.334
>> JIMMY: Whoa.

10:01.368 --> 10:02.469
She never returned you?

10:02.502 --> 10:04.071
(whispering): Do you miss books?

10:04.104 --> 10:07.407
(mewing)

10:07.440 --> 10:09.710
(Jimmy gags, coughs)

10:12.145 --> 10:14.114
>> GRETCHEN: You want to watch a

10:14.147 --> 10:16.149
little TV first?

10:16.183 --> 10:17.184
>> JIMMY: Okay.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.585
Where's the TV?

10:18.618 --> 10:19.419
>> GRETCHEN: I watch on my

10:19.452 --> 10:20.420
computer.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.254
>> JIMMY: What do you mean, you

10:21.288 --> 10:22.022
watch on your computer?

10:22.055 --> 10:22.790
>> GRETCHEN: You're so old.

10:22.823 --> 10:24.792
Here.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.264
>> JIMMY: Well, you're a festive

10:31.298 --> 10:32.465
masturbator.

10:32.499 --> 10:33.466
>> GRETCHEN: Couldn't find an

10:33.500 --> 10:34.467
extension cord.

10:34.501 --> 10:35.502
(loud Middle Eastern dance music

10:35.535 --> 10:36.670
begins playing)

10:36.704 --> 10:37.971
>> JIMMY: What is that?

10:38.005 --> 10:39.006
>> GRETCHEN (groans): It's my

10:39.039 --> 10:40.140
neighbor Ladan, she has the

10:40.173 --> 10:41.809
worst taste in music.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.677
(screaming): Turn it down,

10:43.711 --> 10:45.713
whore!

10:45.746 --> 10:47.681
(sighs)

10:47.715 --> 10:48.849
Shit.

10:48.882 --> 10:49.717
I think I may have downloaded

10:49.750 --> 10:52.052
porn viruses again.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.487
(sighs): Well, you ready to

10:54.521 --> 10:56.556
slice off a piece of this?

10:56.589 --> 10:58.558
>> JIMMY: Not really.

10:58.591 --> 11:01.862
>> GRETCHEN: Too bad.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.496
>> TOMMY: Boys, this is Edgar.

11:03.530 --> 11:04.832
Edgar, this is Bone Bag and

11:04.865 --> 11:05.833
Martinez.

11:05.866 --> 11:06.633
>> EDGAR: Bone Bag.

11:06.666 --> 11:07.400
>> BONE BAG: Nice to meet you.

11:07.434 --> 11:08.135
>> EDGAR: Martinez.

11:08.168 --> 11:08.902
>> MARTINEZ: Hey, man.

11:08.936 --> 11:09.803
How are you?

11:09.837 --> 11:10.570
>> EDGAR: Good.

11:10.603 --> 11:11.538
>> MARTINEZ: Have a seat.

11:11.571 --> 11:12.873
>> EDGAR: Thank you.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.041
>> MARTINEZ: And so, talk to us,

11:14.074 --> 11:14.908
tell us what it feels like

11:14.942 --> 11:15.876
being home.

11:15.909 --> 11:16.844
>> EDGAR: Oh, well, you know,

11:16.877 --> 11:18.011
it's a hard adjustment, but I

11:18.045 --> 11:18.812
got some good friends who

11:18.846 --> 11:19.813
support me.

11:19.847 --> 11:20.580
>> BONE BAG: It's all you got,

11:20.613 --> 11:21.381
right?

11:21.414 --> 11:22.349
Your brothers.

11:22.382 --> 11:23.150
>> EDGAR: Oh, no, I mean civie

11:23.183 --> 11:24.184
friends.

11:24.217 --> 11:25.052
I don't really hang with anyone

11:25.085 --> 11:26.186
from over there.

11:26.219 --> 11:27.254
>> BONE BAG: They remind you

11:27.287 --> 11:28.055
too much of all the shit that

11:28.088 --> 11:28.822
went down?

11:28.856 --> 11:29.589
>> EDGAR: Nah, mostly, they're

11:29.622 --> 11:30.490
just kind of dicks.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.258
So where'd you guys train?

11:31.291 --> 11:32.359
I was at Pendleton.

11:32.392 --> 11:33.493
>> TOMMY: Yeah, yeah, same here.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.327
>> MARTINEZ: Bitch, you went to

11:34.361 --> 11:35.395
Juilliard.

11:35.428 --> 11:36.529
>> EDGAR: I've never heard of

11:36.563 --> 11:37.230
that base.

11:37.264 --> 11:38.031
>> WAITRESS: Here you go, guys.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.000
>> MARTINEZ: Ah, yes.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.001
>> BONE BAG: My Pilates

11:41.034 --> 11:41.701
instructor is gonna be so

11:41.735 --> 11:42.402
pissed at me.

11:42.435 --> 11:43.203
>> MARTINEZ: Yeah, at least I go

11:43.236 --> 11:44.271
back to boot camp tomorrow.

11:44.304 --> 11:45.438
>> EDGAR: Why would you go back

11:45.472 --> 11:46.439
to boot camp?

11:46.473 --> 11:47.240
>> MARTINEZ: Dude, there's a

11:47.274 --> 11:48.241
great one on Melrose.

11:48.275 --> 11:49.276
>> TOMMY: So, Edgar, why don't

11:49.309 --> 11:50.510
you tell us that story you were

11:50.543 --> 11:51.779
telling at the dedication?

11:51.812 --> 11:53.613
>> EDGAR: Oh, uh, okay, um...

11:53.646 --> 11:55.582
well, you know how when you get

11:55.615 --> 11:57.017
back and it's hard to stop

11:57.050 --> 11:58.551
seeing danger everywhere?

11:58.585 --> 11:59.452
It's like, I used to have these

11:59.486 --> 12:01.088
dreams about war...

12:01.121 --> 12:01.955
>> MARTINEZ: Hold on, hold on.

12:01.989 --> 12:03.090
>> EDGAR: ...lots of violent

12:03.123 --> 12:04.091
stuff.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.258
>> MARTINEZ: Wait, wait, wait.

12:05.292 --> 12:06.693
Okay.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.128
(Edgar clears throat)

12:08.161 --> 12:09.296
>> EDGAR: But...

12:09.329 --> 12:11.098
now they're the same.

12:11.131 --> 12:13.133
Only the dream is set here

12:13.166 --> 12:14.567
at home.

12:14.601 --> 12:16.870
Does that ever happen to you

12:16.904 --> 12:17.905
guys?

12:17.938 --> 12:19.873
>> BONE BAG: No, I take Ambien.

12:19.907 --> 12:20.908
>> GIRL: Excuse me, we are giant

12:20.941 --> 12:21.942
fans.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.043
Could we get your autograph?

12:23.076 --> 12:24.411
>> TOMMY: Not now.

12:24.444 --> 12:27.948
>> GIRL: Not even here?

12:27.981 --> 12:30.350
>> TOMMY: Absolutely.

12:34.021 --> 12:35.088
>> GIRL: Thanks.

12:35.122 --> 12:37.490
(girl sighs)

12:39.426 --> 12:40.593
>> EDGAR: Who are you guys?

12:40.627 --> 12:41.795
>> MARTINEZ: You didn't tell

12:41.829 --> 12:42.662
him?

12:42.695 --> 12:43.396
>> TOMMY: I was just in

12:43.430 --> 12:44.097
character.

12:44.131 --> 12:44.932
I was assuming that he knew and

12:44.965 --> 12:45.799
he was just running with it.

12:45.833 --> 12:46.834
>> BONE BAG: I'm so sorry, man.

12:46.867 --> 12:47.835
We're prepping for a movie.

12:47.868 --> 12:48.601
>> MARTINEZ: Uh, it's this

12:48.635 --> 12:49.837
gritty indie flick; we play

12:49.870 --> 12:51.104
soldiers trying to adjust to

12:51.138 --> 12:52.139
life back home.

12:52.172 --> 12:53.106
>> TOMMY: Seriously, you've

12:53.140 --> 12:54.241
never seen NCIS: LA?

12:54.274 --> 12:55.475
I was nominated for an ALMA

12:55.508 --> 12:56.243
last year.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.277
I'm a quarter Peruvian, I know I

12:57.310 --> 12:57.945
don't look it, but...

12:57.978 --> 12:58.946
>> EDGAR: All right, I'm gonna

12:58.979 --> 12:59.947
go.

12:59.980 --> 13:00.948
(actors protesting)

13:00.981 --> 13:02.816
>> TOMMY: I am really sorry.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.651
We just want to make this as

13:04.684 --> 13:07.520
real... as possible.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.522
For you.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.191
>> MARTINEZ: Yeah.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.863
>> EDGAR: Okay, I'm in.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.530
All right, I get it.

13:17.564 --> 13:18.598
Yeah, I get it.

13:18.631 --> 13:19.599
>> TOMMY: It's great!

13:19.632 --> 13:20.767
Now, if you could just sign this

13:20.800 --> 13:22.369
life-rights release thingy...

13:22.402 --> 13:24.304
it-it, but, it-it, it's typical

13:24.337 --> 13:25.338
lawyer bullshit-- it's just to

13:25.372 --> 13:27.474
protect you... from suing us.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.742
(Tommy sighs)

13:33.847 --> 13:34.814
(people speaking loudly in

13:34.848 --> 13:35.815
foreign language)

13:35.849 --> 13:37.817
(Jimmy sighs)

13:41.754 --> 13:44.091
(Jimmy gasps)

13:46.593 --> 13:48.461
>> GRETCHEN: So, you gonna stick

13:48.495 --> 13:49.229
around for a bit or...?

13:49.262 --> 13:50.197
>> JIMMY: Yeah, of course.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.131
>> GRETCHEN (laughs): Oh...

13:51.164 --> 13:53.133
Oh... good... then.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.068
So... we could try to watch TV

13:55.102 --> 13:56.703
again.

13:56.736 --> 13:58.005
>> JIMMY: Except it's not a TV,

13:58.038 --> 13:59.039
is it?

13:59.072 --> 14:00.040
It's a computer.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.041
>> GRETCHEN: I watch television

14:01.074 --> 14:02.042
programs on it, so for my

14:02.075 --> 14:03.176
purposes, it is a TV.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.177
>> JIMMY: Although TVs don't

14:04.211 --> 14:04.844
usually get viruses from

14:04.878 --> 14:05.645
downloading too many gang bang

14:05.678 --> 14:06.579
videos.

14:06.613 --> 14:07.580
>> GRETCHEN: Consensual group

14:07.614 --> 14:08.815
sex is very different than a

14:08.848 --> 14:10.017
gang bang.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.184
>> JIMMY: Is it?

14:11.218 --> 14:12.185
>> GRETCHEN: All right, I get

14:12.219 --> 14:13.386
it.

14:13.420 --> 14:14.421
My place isn't as nice as yours.

14:14.454 --> 14:15.588
>> JIMMY: Your place isn't as

14:15.622 --> 14:16.589
nice as a crack hovel.

14:16.623 --> 14:17.824
>> GRETCHEN: Maybe it isn't

14:17.857 --> 14:19.927
perfectly OCD tidy, or decorated

14:19.960 --> 14:21.929
with stupid posters of dumb art,

14:21.962 --> 14:22.996
or pillows with goddamn whales,

14:23.030 --> 14:24.164
or old-timey maps, but it's

14:24.197 --> 14:25.165
still my home.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.333
>> JIMMY: My phone is covered in

14:26.366 --> 14:27.534
goo!

14:27.567 --> 14:28.735
>> GRETCHEN: Join the club,

14:28.768 --> 14:29.937
phone!

14:29.970 --> 14:31.171
If you want to go, just go.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.339
>> JIMMY: Not unless you want me

14:32.372 --> 14:35.943
to go.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.512
Fine.

14:39.546 --> 14:40.713
You know what?

14:40.747 --> 14:42.082
I can feel you wanting me to

14:42.115 --> 14:44.417
leave like a scorching flame

14:44.451 --> 14:45.718
emanating from the other side of

14:45.752 --> 14:46.920
the bed, so I'm going to leave.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.355
>> GRETCHEN: Don't invent that I

14:48.388 --> 14:49.856
want you to leave just as a

14:49.889 --> 14:50.890
smoke-screen for you wanting to

14:50.924 --> 14:52.092
leave.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.260
>> JIMMY: Then I'll stay!

14:53.293 --> 14:54.461
>> GRETCHEN: No!

14:54.494 --> 14:55.695
I don't want to be the person

14:55.728 --> 14:57.130
who makes you stay somewhere you

14:57.164 --> 14:58.098
don't want to be.

14:58.131 --> 14:59.266
>> JIMMY: If that's what you

14:59.299 --> 15:00.467
want.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.701
(Jimmy clears his throat)

15:01.734 --> 15:02.702
>> GRETCHEN: Fine, just walk

15:02.735 --> 15:03.903
away.

15:03.937 --> 15:04.904
>> JIMMY: No, you are kicking me

15:04.938 --> 15:06.106
out!

15:06.139 --> 15:07.107
>> GRETCHEN: Whatever you have

15:07.140 --> 15:08.275
to tell yourself.

15:08.308 --> 15:09.476
>> JIMMY: So, I should go or...?

15:09.509 --> 15:10.710
>> GRETCHEN: If that's what you

15:10.743 --> 15:11.911
want to do.

15:11.945 --> 15:14.281
(Jimmy scoffs)

15:14.314 --> 15:16.683
(Gretchen sighs)

15:22.755 --> 15:25.425
>> LINDSAY: What are you doing?

15:25.458 --> 15:26.626
>> EDGAR: Nothing.

15:26.659 --> 15:27.827
They're not home.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.062
>> LINDSAY: Shoot!

15:29.096 --> 15:31.898
I need to talk to Gretchen.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.467
Can I ask you a question?

15:34.501 --> 15:36.569
What do you think of my ass?

15:36.603 --> 15:38.972
>> EDGAR: I-I don't know.

15:39.006 --> 15:42.542
Well, let me see it.

15:47.047 --> 15:49.316
It looks fine to me.

15:49.349 --> 15:50.583
I mean, it's just something you

15:50.617 --> 15:51.784
sit on.

15:51.818 --> 15:52.986
It's not like the size of your

15:53.020 --> 15:54.187
ass defines you.

15:54.221 --> 15:55.355
>> LINDSAY: You've never been

15:55.388 --> 15:56.956
west of Doheny.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.092
What are you doing out here?

15:59.126 --> 16:00.327
>> EDGAR: Waiting for someone.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.494
>> LINDSAY: Who?

16:01.528 --> 16:02.695
>> EDGAR: My dealer.

16:02.729 --> 16:05.098
I called him, and then I was

16:05.132 --> 16:06.833
waiting, and when I thought it

16:06.866 --> 16:08.435
was him pulling up, I suddenly

16:08.468 --> 16:10.437
thought maybe I didn't want

16:10.470 --> 16:12.105
heroin after all.

16:12.139 --> 16:14.307
>> LINDSAY: Do you want heroin?

16:14.341 --> 16:15.942
>> EDGAR: No.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.211
But mostly yes right now.

16:18.245 --> 16:19.712
>> LINDSAY: Do you want to come

16:19.746 --> 16:24.317
with me instead?

16:24.351 --> 16:27.154
>> EDGAR: Yeah.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.522
(engine starting)

16:41.101 --> 16:44.037
(loud music plays in car)

16:44.071 --> 16:45.338
>> KILLIAN: Hi.

16:45.372 --> 16:48.941
>> DEALER: What you need, fool?

16:52.011 --> 16:53.180
>> GRETCHEN: Thanks.

16:53.213 --> 16:54.347
>> PIZZA DELIVERY GUY: You bet.

16:54.381 --> 16:55.515
Sign that, please.

16:55.548 --> 16:56.716
And don't forget to enjoy that

16:56.749 --> 16:57.917
pizza.

16:57.950 --> 16:59.152
I am so excited for you.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.353
And have a beautiful evening.

17:00.387 --> 17:01.521
>> GRETCHEN: Wait a second.

17:01.554 --> 17:02.722
Why the hell are you so happy?

17:02.755 --> 17:03.923
>> PIZZA DELIVERY GUY: With

17:03.956 --> 17:05.158
what? Like, my job?

17:05.192 --> 17:06.359
>> GRETCHEN: Well, yeah.

17:06.393 --> 17:07.527
No offense.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.728
>> PIZZA DELIVERY GUY: No, none

17:08.761 --> 17:09.929
taken.

17:09.962 --> 17:11.164
It's like a really sweet gig for

17:11.198 --> 17:12.365
me.

17:12.399 --> 17:13.366
I just drive around, listening

17:13.400 --> 17:14.367
to TED Talks or my jams or

17:14.401 --> 17:15.368
whatever, and if I want to get

17:15.402 --> 17:16.569
high, let's roll.

17:16.603 --> 17:17.570
If I don't want to deliver a

17:17.604 --> 17:18.771
pizza, I don't.

17:18.805 --> 17:19.772
I just pull over and eat that

17:19.806 --> 17:20.773
shit, and I tell 'em I got

17:20.807 --> 17:22.008
robbed again.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.009
Put that up against your 401K,

17:23.042 --> 17:24.211
you know?

17:24.244 --> 17:25.212
>> GRETCHEN: So, you don't want

17:25.245 --> 17:26.213
to have your own pizza

17:26.246 --> 17:27.380
restaurant?

17:27.414 --> 17:28.381
>> PIZZA DELIVERY GUY: Oh, my

17:28.415 --> 17:29.382
God, that would be awesome.

17:29.416 --> 17:30.583
You want to do that?

17:30.617 --> 17:31.784
Let's do it.

17:31.818 --> 17:32.785
>> GRETCHEN: Oh, no. No, no, no.

17:32.819 --> 17:33.786
>> PIZZA DELIVERY GUY: Give me

17:33.820 --> 17:35.021
your number.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.022
>> GRETCHEN: I was just...

17:36.055 --> 17:37.224
Never mind.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.225
>> PIZZA DELIVERY GUY: Yeah,

17:38.258 --> 17:39.226
it's probably a lot of work,

17:39.259 --> 17:40.393
huh?

17:40.427 --> 17:41.394
For now, just delivering

17:41.428 --> 17:42.395
happiness really works for my

17:42.429 --> 17:45.998
lifestyle, so... namaste.

17:48.435 --> 17:50.403
>> EDGAR: Hold still.

17:50.437 --> 17:51.604
One more.

17:51.638 --> 17:52.805
>> LINDSAY: Oh.

17:52.839 --> 17:54.040
>> EDGAR: Ah.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.242
>> LINDSAY: Oh. Ah!

17:55.275 --> 17:56.409
(Edgar mumbles)

17:56.443 --> 17:57.610
Ah! Oh, yeah.

17:57.644 --> 17:58.811
>> EDGAR: All right, so my

17:58.845 --> 18:00.880
point is, I just don't want to

18:00.913 --> 18:01.981
be some symbol of patriotism.

18:02.014 --> 18:03.283
>> LINDSAY: No kidding.

18:03.316 --> 18:04.451
It's depressing.

18:04.484 --> 18:05.652
Whenever they bring one of those

18:05.685 --> 18:06.886
army guys out to sing the

18:06.919 --> 18:08.087
National Anthem, I'm like, "Ugh,

18:08.121 --> 18:09.289
no.

18:09.322 --> 18:11.291
Where's Beyoncé?"

18:11.324 --> 18:12.459
>> EDGAR: So, how do I get

18:12.492 --> 18:13.660
people to treat me normal?

18:13.693 --> 18:14.894
>> LINDSAY: Stop talking about

18:14.927 --> 18:16.629
it all the time!

18:16.663 --> 18:18.265
If you have a bad thought, just

18:18.298 --> 18:19.432
push it down.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.234
Or eat it, like I do.

18:21.268 --> 18:22.602
I mean, I don't see

18:22.635 --> 18:24.271
you as just some vet.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.438
>> EDGAR: Well, how do you see

18:25.472 --> 18:26.639
me?

18:26.673 --> 18:27.840
>> LINDSAY: As a freeloading,

18:27.874 --> 18:28.841
kind of dumb Mexican guy that

18:28.875 --> 18:30.076
hangs out at Jimmy's.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.278
How do you see me?

18:31.311 --> 18:33.813
>> EDGAR: Um... as Gretchen's

18:33.846 --> 18:36.783
pretty friend who should learn

18:36.816 --> 18:38.451
to be happy with who she is.

18:38.485 --> 18:39.619
>> WAITRESS: Here you go.

18:39.652 --> 18:40.820
>> LINDSAY: Oh!

18:40.853 --> 18:42.021
>> WAITRESS: So, I didn't get a

18:42.054 --> 18:43.256
chance to tell you when you were

18:43.290 --> 18:44.457
here earlier today, but we have

18:44.491 --> 18:45.658
a military discount.

18:45.692 --> 18:46.859
>> EDGAR: Aw, thanks, but... I'm

18:46.893 --> 18:48.094
good.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.296
Psst.

18:49.329 --> 18:50.463
Um, yes, of course I'll have

18:50.497 --> 18:52.865
that discount, thank you.

18:52.899 --> 18:54.100
>> LINDSAY: Ow! Ow!

18:54.133 --> 18:55.302
>> EDGAR: Are you okay?

18:55.335 --> 18:56.469
>> LINDSAY: Yes. The pain makes

18:56.503 --> 18:57.670
it even better.

18:57.704 --> 18:58.871
>> EDGAR: Did you...?

18:58.905 --> 19:00.106
>> LINDSAY: Mm-hmm.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.308
>> EDGAR: Hold on.

19:01.341 --> 19:02.475
>> LINDSAY: It's the best.

19:02.509 --> 19:03.676
Right?

19:03.710 --> 19:04.877
>> EDGAR: Aw. Uh-huh.

19:04.911 --> 19:07.447
>> LINDSAY: Mm-hmm.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.317
(knocking)

19:10.350 --> 19:11.484
>> GRETCHEN: Hey.

19:11.518 --> 19:12.685
Where are you going?

19:12.719 --> 19:13.886
>> JIMMY: To come see you.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.155
I wanted to say, uh, I'm sorry.

19:16.189 --> 19:17.357
>> GRETCHEN: For dissing my

19:17.390 --> 19:18.491
apartment?

19:18.525 --> 19:19.692
>> JIMMY: No. That place is a

19:19.726 --> 19:21.160
shithole, but you're right.

19:21.194 --> 19:22.362
I can be a bit... set in my

19:22.395 --> 19:23.530
ways, and I should have invited

19:23.563 --> 19:24.731
you to breakfast.

19:24.764 --> 19:25.965
>> GRETCHEN: Yes.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.166
>> JIMMY: And I shouldn't have

19:27.200 --> 19:28.368
left your apartment.

19:28.401 --> 19:29.536
>> GRETCHEN: Eh. Actually, I'm

19:29.569 --> 19:30.737
glad you left.

19:30.770 --> 19:31.738
>> JIMMY: You are?

19:31.771 --> 19:32.839
>> GRETCHEN: Turns out I'm

19:32.872 --> 19:33.506
like you.

19:33.540 --> 19:34.541
I want things on my own terms,

19:34.574 --> 19:35.542
too.

19:35.575 --> 19:36.743
When I deliver the pussy, I can

19:36.776 --> 19:37.977
leave whenever I want.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.178
>> JIMMY: Sorry. Deliver the

19:39.212 --> 19:40.380
pussy?

19:40.413 --> 19:41.548
>> GRETCHEN: It sounds better

19:41.581 --> 19:42.749
when a black guy says it.

19:42.782 --> 19:43.983
I am probably broken, Jimmy.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.184
I don't know.

19:45.218 --> 19:47.387
My point is, I am done comparing

19:47.420 --> 19:50.657
this to what normal people do.

19:50.690 --> 19:51.858
>> JIMMY: Good.

19:51.891 --> 19:53.092
Why would we even want to do

19:53.125 --> 19:54.327
what normal people do?

19:54.361 --> 19:55.528
>> GRETCHEN: Yeah.

19:55.562 --> 19:58.898
Normal people are terrible.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.767
So am I coming in, or are we...?

20:00.800 --> 20:03.603
>> JIMMY: Yeah, come on.

20:07.374 --> 20:08.541
>> TOMMY: It's nice that the

20:08.575 --> 20:12.111
city unveiled this statue...

20:12.144 --> 20:14.213
but...

20:14.247 --> 20:16.716
it isn't enough...

20:23.222 --> 20:24.424
We ache, yet nobody pays

20:24.457 --> 20:26.025
attention!

20:26.058 --> 20:28.895
Well... you're going to pay

20:28.928 --> 20:30.096
attention now.
