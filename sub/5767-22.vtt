00:09.810 --> 00:11.402
Cary asked me.

00:11.440 --> 00:12.532
I know.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.309
He's just on a call.

00:17.580 --> 00:20.515
So, the IRA agreed to
an Offer and Compromise,

00:20.550 --> 00:23.110
on your tax case.

00:23.150 --> 00:24.344
The IRA?

00:26.190 --> 00:29.057
The... the IRS.

00:29.090 --> 00:30.489
You'll have to
pay a penalty,

00:30.530 --> 00:32.225
we can deal with all
the specrflcs later,

00:32.260 --> 00:34.455
but you have some un-cashed
checks in your file.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.092
You should take a
look at those.

00:36.130 --> 00:37.791
Thanks.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.232
I'm not gay.

00:44.770 --> 00:47.375
You asked
whether I was gay?

00:47.410 --> 00:49.298
Yes...

00:49.350 --> 00:50.499
two years ago.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.415
I know.

00:52.450 --> 00:54.509
I wanted to answer.

00:54.550 --> 00:56.347
I'm not gay, I'm...

00:58.320 --> 00:59.582
...flexible.

00:59.620 --> 01:01.759
Okay.

01:03.560 --> 01:06.199
Flexible. Good.

01:06.230 --> 01:08.596
And, uh...

01:08.630 --> 01:10.860
Lana Delaney,
this FBI agent,

01:10.900 --> 01:13.266
that's... flexible?

01:13.300 --> 01:16.133
Yeah. Sort of.

01:16.170 --> 01:19.173
Because as your lawyer,
I wouldn't...

01:20.380 --> 01:23.099
You know what, it's your life.
You do what you want.

01:23.150 --> 01:26.813
(cell phone buzzing)

01:28.250 --> 01:29.683
What?

01:29.720 --> 01:32.154
It's the_Veriscene case.
The Judgment's In.

01:32.190 --> 01:33.350
We find out tomorrow.

01:33.390 --> 01:35.153
That's good.

01:35.190 --> 01:38.353
I don't know. I've got a bad
feeling about this one.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.358
How's everyone this morning?

01:40.400 --> 01:41.651
DIANE:
Well, Your Honor.

01:41.700 --> 01:44.362
_ We seem to have
a deSIgnated hitter here today.

01:44.400 --> 01:45.765
Yes, Your Honor.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.791
My partner, Will Gardner,
couldn't be in court...

01:47.840 --> 01:50.263
Oh, you don't have to cover for
him. I know Will's suspended.

01:50.310 --> 01:52.699
How's he doing?
Very well, thank you for asking.

01:52.740 --> 01:55.231
Like a kid
with ﬁve days until Christmas.

01:55.280 --> 01:56.304
(Wynter laughs)

01:56.350 --> 01:57.908
Well, tell him
he's missed.

01:57.950 --> 01:59.645
Shall we get started?

01:59.680 --> 02:02.478
Plaintiff alleges
that Veriscene,

02:02.520 --> 02:04.545
a drug administered
for the cure of acne,

02:04.590 --> 02:07.582
_caused_ Mr. Goode
irreverSIble sterility.

02:07.620 --> 02:10.259
Accordingly, I am entering
judgment for the plaintiff,

02:10.290 --> 02:12.451
in the amount of $25 million
in compensatory.

02:12.500 --> 02:15.298
I acknowledge that this amount

02:15.330 --> 02:18.390
is in excess of the $18 million
requested by the plaintiff,

02:18.430 --> 02:20.898
but I find the actions here
particularly heinous.

02:20.940 --> 02:22.407
Your Honor...
Yes, Mr. Canning?

02:22.440 --> 02:24.328
You want to appeal?

02:24.370 --> 02:26.372
Oh, I do. Uh, vehemently.
As is your right.

02:26.410 --> 02:29.868
Mr. Goode, no matter where this
ends up, I want you to know,

02:29.910 --> 02:33.368
justice was done here today.

02:33.420 --> 02:34.569
Whoo-hoo! Yes!

02:34.620 --> 02:36.417
(both laughing)

02:36.450 --> 02:38.441
Congratulations.

02:38.490 --> 02:40.583
I am rarely speechless,
but I am speechless.

02:40.620 --> 02:42.724
GOODE: Thank you.
Thank you both.

02:42.760 --> 02:44.352
DIANE:
It's not over yet.
They're going to

02:44.390 --> 02:46.324
drag this out in
appeals, so...

02:46.360 --> 02:47.759
I thought it was
going against us.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.394
Sometimes fate smiles.

02:50.430 --> 02:52.466
Will, are you
standing or sitting?

02:52.500 --> 02:54.866
Which one do you
want me to be?

02:58.840 --> 02:59.909
You're kidding.

03:01.340 --> 03:03.444
You're kidding.

03:03.480 --> 03:05.778
(laughing)
Do you know what this means?

03:05.810 --> 03:07.448
That we can pay off
our balloon payment.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.914
And dodge the executioner
for another quarter.

03:09.950 --> 03:11.383
If you get a settlement.

03:11.420 --> 03:12.819
Where's Canning at?
He'll appeal.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.283
For effect.
$25 million should motivate him.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.423
(Diane laughs)

03:16.460 --> 03:18.451
Peter, you okay?

03:18.490 --> 03:19.991
(exhales)

03:20.030 --> 03:22.419
We have a problem
with the house.

03:22.470 --> 03:23.926
We?

03:23.970 --> 03:26.268
Uh, Jackie.

03:26.300 --> 03:29.929
She paid ten percent in
cash on the down payment.

03:31.270 --> 03:33.579
Apparently, she was
bidding against someone.

03:33.610 --> 03:37.376
Me. She was
bidding against me.
(chuckles)

03:37.410 --> 03:40.675
So I'm planning on going
ahead with the purchase

03:40.720 --> 03:43.484
and then flipping the
house in a few months.

03:43.520 --> 03:45.385
Okay.

03:45.420 --> 03:46.648
Are you moving in?

03:46.690 --> 03:48.385
Just temporarily.
I think

03:48.420 --> 03:49.956
I could get more
money for the house

03:49.990 --> 03:51.548
if I did some work
in the backyard.

03:51.590 --> 03:54.491
Why are you
telling me this, Peter?

03:54.530 --> 03:58.022
Look, I don't want you
to worry about these...

03:58.070 --> 03:59.389
decisions.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.964
This is all temporary.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.558
I'm not trying to...

04:02.610 --> 04:04.430
Colonize our past?

04:04.470 --> 04:06.335
(chuckles)
Well, I don't think

04:06.380 --> 04:07.972
I'd exactly put it that way,

04:08.010 --> 04:11.275
but yes, I don't want these
decisions to be misunderstood.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.969
Okay. I won't.

04:14.020 --> 04:17.979
So... we're making
this work, right?

04:18.020 --> 04:19.681
Oddly, yes, we are.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.415
(chuckles)

04:23.590 --> 04:25.751
I heard Cary is
back with you guys.

04:25.790 --> 04:28.497
Yep, starts today.
Oh.

04:28.530 --> 04:30.498
He's a good guy.

04:30.530 --> 04:32.464
Wish him luck.

04:32.500 --> 04:35.435
So, we'll need you
out here until we get
an office cleared out,

04:35.470 --> 04:37.506
if you're all right
with that.
I am.

04:37.540 --> 04:40.407
Good. It'll just
be a few weeks.

04:45.480 --> 04:47.778
(long sigh)

04:47.820 --> 04:50.345
(quietly):
Welcome back, Cary.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.952
Whew.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.540
(line ringing)

05:24.020 --> 05:25.578
MAN:
Yeah?

05:25.620 --> 05:28.316
Um, is this F&E Construction?

05:30.560 --> 05:31.822
Hello?

05:31.860 --> 05:33.828
Who is this?

05:33.860 --> 05:37.466
Uh, I'm a lawyer following up
on a un-cashed check

05:37.500 --> 05:39.639
from F&E Construction.

05:39.670 --> 05:42.833
Unfortunately, we'll need you
to reissue the check.

05:44.810 --> 05:47.608
Who is this?

05:47.640 --> 05:50.108
Um... is this F&E Construction?

05:50.150 --> 05:51.469
Yes.

05:51.510 --> 05:53.512
I don't recognize your voice.

05:53.550 --> 05:56.678
I'm a lawyer representing...

05:56.720 --> 05:58.449
someone.. .

05:58.490 --> 06:01.857
uh, who has an un-cashed check
from F&E Construction,

06:01.890 --> 06:03.949
and she can't access her funds,

06:03.990 --> 06:06.129
uh, unless you reissue, so...

06:06.160 --> 06:08.390
Who's the check made out to?

06:08.430 --> 06:09.522
Cash.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.593
(man chuckles)

06:13.640 --> 06:16.438
Where are you
calling from, lady?

06:16.470 --> 06:18.802
Can you just reissue
the check, sir?

06:18.840 --> 06:21.832
Sure. Give me a check number.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.947
You know what, um, I'll call
you back with that information.

06:27.980 --> 06:29.686
Thank you.

06:30.720 --> 06:31.846
(whistles)

06:31.890 --> 06:33.517
Wow.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.084
(laughs)
Oh, hey, Cary.

06:35.120 --> 06:37.156
How are you doing?
Good.

06:37.190 --> 06:38.919
You seem to be, too.

06:38.960 --> 06:41.599
Oh, it's just from being
liaison to Eli Gold.

06:41.630 --> 06:44.167
As soon as he's back
on the campaign trail,

06:44.200 --> 06:46.930
I'll be out there with
everyone else. Where are you?

06:46.970 --> 06:48.631
_ I'm out there
With everyone else.

06:48.670 --> 06:50.865
(laughs)
Well, then you'll have company.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.002
Canning.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.473
Oh, Cary.

06:53.510 --> 06:55.603
Good to have you back.
Thank you.

06:55.640 --> 06:57.176
The Veriscene case-- we're
in the middle of negotiations.

06:57.210 --> 06:59.474
Yeah, go for it.
I know my way around.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.612
DIANE:
We're not committing

07:00.650 --> 07:03.585
to an offer yet, but if you
have a number, we'll listen.

07:05.150 --> 07:07.186
Mr. Canning,
are you with us?

07:07.220 --> 07:10.018
Oh, I'm sorry, I was
just texting my lavwer.

07:10.060 --> 07:12.494
It's funny, isn't it,
lawyers having lawyers?

07:12.530 --> 07:14.555
And my lawyer probably
has a lawyer, too.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.591
We should all be getting
progressively smaller,

07:16.630 --> 07:17.961
like matryoshka dolls.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.228
Yes. So_ are we
neganhng,

07:20.270 --> 07:22.090
or what are we doing?
No, we're
negoﬁaﬂng.

07:22.140 --> 07:24.938
I-I think I have
an offer for you.

07:24.970 --> 07:26.733
A one-time offer.

07:30.210 --> 07:31.746
Zero? Really?
Yeah, unfortunately

07:31.780 --> 07:35.511
you have five minutes to
decide whether to take it.

07:35.550 --> 07:36.812
I see.
And if we don't,

07:36.850 --> 07:39.114
you have a bomb or something?

07:39.150 --> 07:40.856
Sort of.

07:40.890 --> 07:42.858
Hi. We're all here.
Where are you?

07:42.890 --> 07:44.755
Just changing.
I'll be right in.

07:44.790 --> 07:46.826
The rash is
back, Michael.

07:46.860 --> 07:48.725
I know. I'm trying the
ointment three times a day.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.660
PATTI:
You have to stop eating
so much spicy food.

07:50.700 --> 07:53.589
Yes. No more Thai
food for you.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.835
Oh, please,
it's just poop.

07:55.870 --> 07:58.236
You shovel the stuff
all day, buddy.

07:58.270 --> 07:59.931
Oh, God.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.732
Patti Nyholm.

08:01.780 --> 08:03.600
Well, look at you.
And you.

08:03.650 --> 08:06.107
Poster child
for Motherhood Today.

08:06.150 --> 08:08.243
You have no changing tables
in the restroom, Will.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.748
It's a lawsuit
waiting to happen.
Yep, doing our part

08:10.790 --> 08:12.553
to suppress the birth rate.

08:12.590 --> 08:13.750
So, I need

08:13.790 --> 08:15.781
some legal advice
on my contract.

08:15.820 --> 08:17.924
Oh, my God, wait.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.019
You can't practice
law anymore.

08:20.060 --> 08:22.790
What was I thinking?

08:22.830 --> 08:23.922
No, thank you.

08:23.970 --> 08:25.164
I'll be right out, Michael.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.690
This'll take a few minutes.

08:26.740 --> 08:29.061
That must be really
hard on you, Will,

08:29.100 --> 08:31.705
just sitting around
watching all these lawyers

08:31.740 --> 08:33.776
while you're, what,
surfing the Web?

08:33.810 --> 08:36.028
Clipping coupons?
What's up, Patti?

08:36.080 --> 08:38.207
A lawsuit.
Really? Which one?

08:38.250 --> 08:41.549
A new one. It'll
be great being on
opposite sides again,

08:41.580 --> 08:42.808
dusting it up...

08:42.850 --> 08:44.841
Oh, wait. Darn it.

08:44.890 --> 08:47.211
You're not a
lawyer anymore.

08:47.260 --> 08:50.684
I keep forgetting.

08:50.730 --> 08:51.958
So sorry I'm late.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.218
Here's my lawyer now.

08:53.260 --> 08:55.296
Ms. Nyholm, I believe
you know everybody.

08:55.330 --> 08:57.321
I think I do. Hello.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.792
How are your
negotiations going?

08:58.830 --> 09:00.263
CANNING: Well, I don't
know, I gave them

09:00.300 --> 09:03.861
five minutes to agree
to my settlement offer,
and that time is up... now.

09:03.910 --> 09:05.036
We're suing you.

09:05.070 --> 09:07.038
CANNING:
On behalf of LOC
Pharmaceuticals,

09:07.080 --> 09:08.775
makers of Veriscene
and Elvatyl.

09:08.810 --> 09:10.107
And their insurer, LifeState.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.777
We joined forces

09:11.810 --> 09:13.914
to sue you for
$50 million

09:13.950 --> 09:16.885
for fraud and malicious
prosecution.
Come on,

09:16.920 --> 09:18.911
this is harassment.
Is that your legal
opinion, Will?

09:18.950 --> 09:20.087
DIANE:
No, it's mine.

09:20.120 --> 09:21.781
Your company
doesn't like being sued,

09:21.820 --> 09:24.084
try making products that
don't kill and maim people.

09:24.130 --> 09:26.223
PATTI:
Here's a better idea--
stop intentionally

09:26.260 --> 09:27.989
and wrongfully
instituting legal
proceedings

09:28.030 --> 09:30.260
you know are
without merit.
We were just

09:30.300 --> 09:32.768
awarded $25 million--
I'd call that merit.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.859
No. I would call that
judicial bribery.

09:36.740 --> 09:37.729
Oops.

09:37.770 --> 09:39.670
Is that a sensitive topic?

09:39.710 --> 09:41.371
This case was
built for a jury.

09:41.410 --> 09:42.536
You requested a bench trial.

09:42.580 --> 09:46.038
It's a million-dollar case,
and your basketball buddy

09:46.080 --> 09:47.775
awarded you $25 million.

09:47.820 --> 09:50.084
I was cleared
by a grand jury.
No.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.088
You weren't indicted
by a grand jury.

09:52.120 --> 09:54.782
You gamed the system;
I know you, Will.

09:54.820 --> 09:56.651
You can't do that with me.

09:56.690 --> 09:59.056
Or with me.
That's right.

09:59.090 --> 10:01.092
We're the dream team.

10:18.380 --> 10:19.642
(suspenseful
movie music playing)

10:19.680 --> 10:21.819
ELI:
Jackie?

10:21.850 --> 10:23.989
Mr. Gold?

10:24.020 --> 10:25.339
Hi.

10:25.390 --> 10:28.279
Peter said you were here.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.720
Shouldn't you be
in synagogue?

10:31.360 --> 10:33.351
Uh... no.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.992
How are you feeling?

10:35.030 --> 10:36.349
Better.
Good.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.766
Then I won't feel bad
about saying this.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.908
Your son is
gomg to lose.

10:43.940 --> 10:46.670
Without Alicia, he will
lose the governorship.

10:46.710 --> 10:48.268
Uh, I-I don't know...

10:48.310 --> 10:50.676
She was on_our
Side, Jackie.

10:50.710 --> 10:51.938
Alicia was offering
to help Peter,

10:51.980 --> 10:53.117
then you got involved.

10:53.150 --> 10:54.344
How did I get involved?

10:54.380 --> 10:55.938
This friggin' house!

10:55.980 --> 10:57.743
My God, I've never
heard so much

10:57.790 --> 10:59.815
real estate _talk
in all my life.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.749
If their separation goes
wide, everything collapses.

11:02.790 --> 11:04.655
Eli, what do you want?

11:07.260 --> 11:09.728
I want you to apologize to her.

11:09.770 --> 11:12.364
(sighs)
Your son will not
win without Alicia,

11:12.400 --> 11:13.867
and I_wi|| not _
manage his campaign

11:13.900 --> 11:15.367
without her.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.799
So say, "I'm sorry,"

11:16.840 --> 11:18.865
even if you
don't believe it.

11:23.180 --> 11:24.875
I dreamt I died.

11:24.910 --> 11:27.310
Everybody just did

11:27.350 --> 11:29.409
what they always did.

11:29.450 --> 11:30.382
They didn't care.

11:30.420 --> 11:32.752
Um, do you want me

11:32.790 --> 11:35.088
to get you a nurse or some...
Are you religious?

11:35.120 --> 11:37.452
Am I, um... I...

11:37.490 --> 11:39.128
I thought Jews believed in God.

11:39.160 --> 11:41.025
Yes, we all do;
every one of us.

11:41.060 --> 11:41.958
I don't want to die.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.365
I'll get you a nurse.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.391
(whispers):
I don't want to die.

11:47.840 --> 11:48.966
It's a scare tactic.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.206
Look at Ketter Sum Holdings.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.333
They sued the lawyers
bringing class actions

11:52.370 --> 11:54.770
against their artificial knees
in order to scare them off.

11:54.810 --> 11:56.107
WILL:
There might be more.

11:56.140 --> 11:58.142
I think Patti is using
this suit to fact-find.

11:58.180 --> 11:59.272
For an appeal?
Yes.

11:59.310 --> 12:00.447
Look who they're deposing.

12:00.480 --> 12:01.947
Kalinda, me.

12:01.980 --> 12:03.481
Patti doesn't have enough,

12:03.520 --> 12:06.409
so she's using this suit to find
out if we did anything wrong.

12:06.450 --> 12:08.008
I wish I could agree,

12:08.060 --> 12:09.755
but if the law
taught me anything,

12:09.790 --> 12:12.486
it's that never,
ever trust a man with a limp.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.822
Look, if they want
to find out more

12:15.860 --> 12:18.499
about our tactics,
we turn it back on them.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.896
ELI:
Right, every time they ask a
question, ask for more detail.

12:20.940 --> 12:22.965
What did you mean by that?

12:23.010 --> 12:24.034
Can you explain?

12:24.070 --> 12:25.105
Good. Anything else?

12:25.140 --> 12:28.405
(banging, toy playing
"Mary Had a Little Lamb")

12:28.440 --> 12:30.340
Sorry.
Okay,

12:30.380 --> 12:32.473
I will sit in with Will;
who do we have for Kalinda?

12:32.510 --> 12:34.375
Most of our litigators
were in on this.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.342
So, they're all subject
to being called.

12:36.380 --> 12:39.247
All but one.

12:39.290 --> 12:42.782
CANNING:
Miss Sharma, have you ever
misrepresented your occupation

12:42.830 --> 12:44.457
in order to interview
a Witness?

12:44.490 --> 12:47.891
Could you be more specific?

12:47.930 --> 12:49.488
Sure.

12:49.530 --> 12:52.169
Have you ever misrepresented
your occupation

12:52.200 --> 12:53.497
in order to interview a witness,

12:53.540 --> 12:55.360
as you did with my wife

12:55.400 --> 12:56.367
to get into my house?

12:56.400 --> 12:58.231
CARY:
Objection, what
does that have to do

12:58.270 --> 12:59.430
with the Veriscene case?
Well, Miss Sharma

12:59.470 --> 13:01.870
claims she's never broken
the law in purswt of a case.

13:01.910 --> 13:05.141
I have firsthand knowledge
of such law-breaking.

13:05.180 --> 13:07.319
So, Miss Sharma, can you
please answer the question?

13:10.220 --> 13:12.814
Could you repeat the question?

13:12.860 --> 13:14.816
Sure. Were you Kalinda
Sharma's direct supervisor?

13:14.860 --> 13:17.181
_ We don't_ have
direct superwsors here.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.528
Did you tell her to investigate
on the Veriscene case?

13:19.560 --> 13:20.788
In what way, "investigate"?

13:22.870 --> 13:24.292
Okay, wm.

13:24.330 --> 13:25.524
I get it.

13:25.570 --> 13:27.333
We can do this all day.

13:28.470 --> 13:29.539
I pull the judge out of court,

13:29.570 --> 13:32.266
he raps you one the knuckles
for being unresponsive,

13:32.310 --> 13:34.369
and all you've done
is waste half a day.

13:34.410 --> 13:35.900
I take exception
to your suggestion

13:35.940 --> 13:37.146
that we're wasting anything.

13:37.180 --> 13:38.602
But remember,

13:38.650 --> 13:41.278
I'm not the one with_ a balloon
payment due on his office.

13:44.390 --> 13:46.142
Oops.

13:46.190 --> 13:48.818
Was that the elephant
in the room?

13:50.460 --> 13:52.155
(toy playing
"Mary Had a Little Lamb")

13:54.100 --> 13:56.022
(phone rings)

13:56.060 --> 13:58.164
Hello.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.293
MAN:
You were gonna get back to me.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.898
I... Who is this?

14:01.940 --> 14:02.736
F&E Construction.

14:02.770 --> 14:05.637
You wanted me
to reissue a check.

14:05.670 --> 14:08.901
Yes, I did.

14:08.940 --> 14:10.578
I said I'd get back to you,
though.

14:10.610 --> 14:12.976
I know, but you didn't.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.580
So I decided to call you.

14:15.620 --> 14:19.215
Okay, um, let me get all
my ducks in a row, sir,

14:19.250 --> 14:21.480
and I'll get back to you.

14:21.520 --> 14:22.555
Sir?

14:22.590 --> 14:25.479
No, you won't.

14:25.530 --> 14:27.327
Excuse me?

14:27.360 --> 14:28.998
You won't call me back.

14:29.030 --> 14:31.919
You have no intention
of calling me back.

14:31.970 --> 14:34.939
I said I would, and so I...

14:34.970 --> 14:36.904
Actually, um,

14:36.940 --> 14:38.908
I think we're done here.

14:38.940 --> 14:40.578
No, we're not.

14:40.610 --> 14:42.601
(line clicks)

14:43.950 --> 14:45.645
WILL:
Could you be more specific?

14:45.680 --> 14:47.910
Did you introduce judges

14:47.950 --> 14:50.316
to bookies at your Wednesday
night basketball...

14:50.350 --> 14:51.647
Objection, relevance.

14:51.690 --> 14:53.988
Isn't Judge Wynter relevant?

14:54.020 --> 14:55.908
The man who awarded
you $25 million?

14:55.960 --> 14:56.949
Isn't he one of the judges

14:56.990 --> 14:58.389
you introduced to bookies?

14:58.430 --> 14:59.988
Objection.
And weren't you confronted

15:00.030 --> 15:01.292
about this at the grand jury?

15:01.330 --> 15:02.991
Excuse me, Ms. Nyholm,

15:03.030 --> 15:04.566
you have referenced proceedings

15:04.600 --> 15:06.227
_ that resulted _
in a sealed transcript.

15:06.270 --> 15:09.330
Yes, but Mr. Gardner can
answer to his own testimony.

15:09.370 --> 15:10.928
This question requires
your knowledge

15:10.970 --> 15:11.959
of the grand jury investigation.

15:12.010 --> 15:13.671
No, it merely requires
Mr. Gardner's knowledge

15:13.710 --> 15:15.974
of the grand jury
investigation.

15:16.010 --> 15:18.069
All right, we're taking this
to the judge.

15:18.110 --> 15:20.112
(overlapping arguing)

15:21.380 --> 15:23.484
Okay, okay, okay.

15:23.520 --> 15:25.249
You are all new to me,

15:25.290 --> 15:27.554
so my apologies if I need
to be reminded of your names,

15:27.590 --> 15:28.955
but Ms.--

15:28.990 --> 15:30.582
Lockhart. _
You are argumg

15:30.630 --> 15:33.190
the only way these questions
could be asked

15:33.230 --> 15:35.994
is if they were taken
from sealed transcripts?

15:36.030 --> 15:37.520
Yes, Your Honor,
someone is leaking them

15:37.570 --> 15:39.026
grand jury testimony,

15:39.070 --> 15:41.538
and we would argue this
line of questioning

15:41.570 --> 15:43.606
should be stricken.

15:46.610 --> 15:49.636
If I may interject, Your Honor,
we're merely asking questions

15:49.680 --> 15:51.568
based on our own knowledge.

15:51.610 --> 15:53.271
And if you can allow me
an explanation,

15:53.320 --> 15:54.639
these movements that you see,

15:54.680 --> 15:56.170
uh, these random movements,

15:56.220 --> 15:57.517
they're the consequence
of a neurological disorder

15:57.550 --> 16:00.713
I suffer from called
tardive dyskinesia.

16:02.290 --> 16:04.053
And I just didn't want you

16:04.090 --> 16:06.354
to misinterpret
any of movements.

16:06.390 --> 16:07.596
Okay, I won't.

16:09.130 --> 16:10.688
I've had this condition
since childhood.

16:10.730 --> 16:13.096
Are you going somewhere
with this, Mr. Canning?
No,

16:13.140 --> 16:15.563
I just wanted
to explain.
Okay, thanks.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.306
I will allow these
questions to proceed.

16:17.340 --> 16:18.705
WILL & DIANE:
Your Honor...

16:18.740 --> 16:21.004
But if you produce evidence
these questions are based

16:21.040 --> 16:23.099
on sealed grand jury evidence,

16:23.150 --> 16:25.448
I will exclude
all such testimony

16:25.480 --> 16:27.175
from this suit.

16:27.220 --> 16:29.472
We need to get Kalinda
to follow Patti and find out

16:29.520 --> 16:31.112
who's leaking
this grand jury testimony.
No.

16:32.490 --> 16:34.754
We need to talk settlement.

16:34.790 --> 16:37.657
Will, we're vulnerable.

16:38.690 --> 16:40.294
No, we're not.

16:40.330 --> 16:42.457
There's nothing there.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.388
But what is there
doesn't look good.

16:44.430 --> 16:46.193
You played
basketball with him,

16:46.230 --> 16:47.492
you introduced him

16:47.540 --> 16:49.496
to a bookie, and he awarded us

16:49.540 --> 16:52.031
seven million above our ask.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.476
Here's what I suggest.

16:55.510 --> 16:56.807
We offer to drop the
Veriscene class action.

16:56.840 --> 16:59.047
It's what they
want, anyway.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.117
Damn it.

17:02.150 --> 17:03.549
I know, but it's
the smart move.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.342
We need to get
this behind us.

17:05.390 --> 17:08.109
This balloon payment,
our clients...

17:08.160 --> 17:10.321
_Patric _Edelst_ein
is making n0ise.

17:10.360 --> 17:12.749
I mean, he's 20%
of our quarter.

17:12.790 --> 17:15.452
Everything's falling
apart as we fight this.

17:16.760 --> 17:18.762
Uh, do you want me...

17:18.800 --> 17:20.768
No, it's all right,
we've just been...

17:20.800 --> 17:23.268
riding close to the edge
this whole year.

17:23.310 --> 17:24.402
It's not for anyone to know.

17:24.440 --> 17:25.668
I understand.

17:28.810 --> 17:30.175
Okay.

17:30.210 --> 17:31.677
Let's make this go away.

17:34.820 --> 17:36.742
They brought
out the buffet.

17:36.780 --> 17:38.509
This must be serious.

17:38.550 --> 17:40.814
You drop the lawsuit,

17:40.860 --> 17:42.589
and we drop the
Veriscene class action.

17:42.620 --> 17:45.054
That's our offer;
take it or leave it.

17:45.830 --> 17:47.195
Fruit?

17:47.230 --> 17:48.549
Please.

17:49.400 --> 17:52.119
Uh, no.

17:52.170 --> 17:53.467
But thank you.
Don't you want

17:53.500 --> 17:54.592
to take it back to your client?

17:54.640 --> 17:56.494
No. _
We're not caVIng
on the appeal.

17:56.540 --> 17:57.768
We know.
DIANE:
You have no case.

17:57.810 --> 18:00.370
Not without
some grand jury leak.
You don't understand.

18:00.410 --> 18:01.775
This isn't about a case.

18:01.810 --> 18:03.778
You-you want to tell them?

18:03.810 --> 18:04.674
No, no.

18:04.710 --> 18:06.803
You're much better
at the nasty stuff.

18:06.850 --> 18:09.216
CANNING:
We're not here to settle.

18:09.250 --> 18:11.115
We're here to destroy you.

18:12.290 --> 18:14.588
PATTI: Our clients are tired
of being sued by you.

18:14.620 --> 18:16.781
Four class actions in two years?

18:16.820 --> 18:18.458
They've taken it personally.

18:18.490 --> 18:19.787
(brightly):
Look at you.

18:19.830 --> 18:20.819
Hi, boo-boo.
They've set aside

18:20.860 --> 18:23.624
a large sum of money to
put you out of business.

18:23.670 --> 18:25.888
That's why we're here,
to make an example of you.

18:25.930 --> 18:27.659
You've seen Butch Cassidy
and the Sundance Kid.

18:27.700 --> 18:29.839
We're the Super-posse.

18:29.870 --> 18:31.508
So, thank you for the offer,

18:31.540 --> 18:32.734
but no.

18:32.770 --> 18:35.375
We're getting paid a lot of
money to make you go bankrupt.

18:35.410 --> 18:36.809
Thank you for the fruit, though.

18:37.810 --> 18:39.778
PATTI :
Peanut

18:39.810 --> 18:42.313
(muffled talking)

18:42.350 --> 18:44.341
(muffled):
Hello, hello.

18:54.660 --> 18:57.367
(children chattering nearby)

19:26.660 --> 19:28.651
Hi. That's pretty.

19:53.620 --> 19:56.259
Well, Kalinda,
funny seeing you here.

19:56.290 --> 19:58.827
Yeah, almost as funny
as seeing you here,

19:58.860 --> 20:01.749
with Ms. Nyholm, leaking
grand jury testimony.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.427
Mr. Wiley
is legally sharing

20:03.470 --> 20:05.995
his 0 testimony
before the grand jury.

20:06.030 --> 20:07.930
Really?
Yeah, the state's attorney

20:07.970 --> 20:10.530
wasn't interested in pursuing
the case against Will Gardner.

20:10.570 --> 20:11.730
Ms. Nyholm is.

20:11.770 --> 20:13.635
And our kids love
playing together.

20:13.680 --> 20:16.501
So it's all
perfectly legal.

20:20.950 --> 20:22.975
Hi.

20:23.020 --> 20:26.581
Cary, we're having some trouble
with Andrew Wiley,

20:26.620 --> 20:29.350
an investigator from
the state's attorney's office.

20:29.390 --> 20:30.527
Yes, I know him.
He's the one working

20:30.560 --> 20:31.822
with Nyholm and Canning.

20:31.860 --> 20:34.420
I doubt that.

20:34.460 --> 20:36.655
Wiley doesn't break the rules.

20:36.700 --> 20:39.828
Unless he's using
his own testimony.

20:39.870 --> 20:42.259
Yep. So we need
something from you.

20:42.300 --> 20:43.961
Well, you know that
I can't share what I know

20:44.010 --> 20:45.602
about the grand jury
because that would be unethical.

20:45.640 --> 20:46.459
Yes, but you

20:46.510 --> 20:49.377
can use your knowledge
in another way.

20:53.720 --> 20:56.348
Thank you for coming.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.382
It means so much to me.

20:59.990 --> 21:02.879
I came to recommend
that you retain a lawyer.

21:02.920 --> 21:04.751
You... Why?

21:04.790 --> 21:06.052
You took money

21:06.090 --> 21:08.627
from my children's trust
so that you could outbid me

21:08.660 --> 21:10.560
on my family home.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.363
I intend to sue you.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.767
I'm sorry, Alicia.

21:16.800 --> 21:20.600
This family's been
through so much, and I...

21:20.640 --> 21:22.835
I thought I knew best.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.871
I'm so sorry.

21:26.410 --> 21:27.672
Jackie, please.

21:27.720 --> 21:28.971
What do you want?

21:29.020 --> 21:31.682
I want you to
accept my apology.

21:31.720 --> 21:33.950
No, you don't.
I want to make things right.

21:33.990 --> 21:35.651
It'll be good

21:35.690 --> 21:38.329
for Zach and Grace
and... and Peter.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.022
(chuckles softly)

21:42.060 --> 21:44.324
You want Peter to win.

21:44.370 --> 21:46.099
That's what you want.

21:46.130 --> 21:48.098
Eli was here, wasn't he?

21:48.140 --> 21:50.700
I-I-I don't know.

21:50.740 --> 21:52.708
I...

21:53.740 --> 21:56.675
(suspenseful music playing)

21:58.710 --> 22:00.678
He...

22:00.720 --> 22:03.416
He can't do it without you.

22:07.920 --> 22:09.888
Here's what I want, Jackie.

22:09.920 --> 22:12.127
You sign the house
over to the kids,

22:12.160 --> 22:15.049
you put it in their names,
I won't sue.

22:22.600 --> 22:27.435
You want me to accept your
apology, show me you mean it.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.630
Sign the house over to the kids.

22:32.750 --> 22:34.513
(clamoring)

22:34.550 --> 22:35.574
Excuse me.

22:35.620 --> 22:37.042
Watch your toes.

22:37.080 --> 22:40.652
Everyone, please,
indoor voices.

22:40.690 --> 22:42.783
Your Honor, like you, I look at
life a little differently--

22:42.820 --> 22:43.821
with a little more caution,

22:43.860 --> 22:45.725
a little more quiet.
Why like me?

22:45.760 --> 22:46.727
I'm sorry, I...

22:46.760 --> 22:47.897
You said "like me."

22:47.930 --> 22:48.954
What do you mean?

22:49.000 --> 22:50.490
What we mean, Your Honor,

22:50.530 --> 22:52.122
is that the defense's motion
is a desperate ploy

22:52.170 --> 22:53.467
to avoid
responsibility.

22:53.500 --> 22:54.762
CARY:
Mr. Canning asked

22:54.800 --> 22:56.563
Ms. Sharma one question
that couldn't have been

22:56.600 --> 22:57.908
in Mr. Wiley's
grand jury testimony,

22:57.940 --> 22:59.737
Your Honor.

22:59.770 --> 23:02.432
The $2,000 in cash
Mr. Gardner gave to a judge--

23:02.480 --> 23:03.742
money that was supposedly
for UNICEF.

23:03.780 --> 23:05.145
Was for UNICEF.

23:05.180 --> 23:06.442
This was evidence that Mr. Wiley

23:06.480 --> 23:07.447
personally witnessed,
Your Honor.

23:07.480 --> 23:08.412
Yes, but the question isn't

23:08.450 --> 23:09.474
whether he personally
witnessed it or not.

23:09.520 --> 23:13.786
Andrew, did you testify to it
or did you witness it?

23:13.820 --> 23:16.084
Wait a minute, you can't
talk to our client.

23:16.120 --> 23:17.678
Andrew, which one did you do?

23:17.730 --> 23:19.584
Oh, my God.
Andrew, no, stop right there!

23:19.630 --> 23:20.426
He's right, I just

23:20.460 --> 23:22.519
witnessed it.
Due to this admission,

23:22.560 --> 23:24.460
Your Honor, all the evidence
regarding Mr. Gardner's

23:24.500 --> 23:26.866
bribing of a judge
should be excluded.

23:26.900 --> 23:28.561
Your Honor, I'd like
to add another name

23:28.600 --> 23:30.397
to our witness list:
Alicia Florrick.

23:34.480 --> 23:36.801
_ I have to
Witness prep you.

23:36.840 --> 23:37.909
They're coming
after you,

23:37.950 --> 23:41.147
trying to get to Will
bribing judges another way.

23:41.180 --> 23:43.171
I know.

23:45.250 --> 23:46.740
F&E Construction.

23:49.790 --> 23:51.781
What is it?

23:53.800 --> 23:54.994
Why?

23:55.030 --> 23:57.760
I found a check
in your file from Canada.

23:57.800 --> 23:59.995
An un-cashed check from 2007.

24:00.030 --> 24:01.793
Yeah. That-that shouldn't
be there.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.660
That should be
in my personal file.

24:03.710 --> 24:05.132
It's for $21,000.

24:05.170 --> 24:07.104
That would go a long way
to pay your tax bill.

24:07.140 --> 24:08.971
I know.
Do you have the check?

24:10.210 --> 24:12.849
Thanks.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.677
It's-it's complicated.

24:14.720 --> 24:16.176
I called the number on it.

24:19.220 --> 24:21.017
As part of your tax work,

24:21.060 --> 24:24.723
I called employers
for updated checks.

24:24.760 --> 24:25.852
VVhen?

24:25.890 --> 24:27.221
When did I call? Tuesday.

24:27.260 --> 24:29.899
Did you speak to anyone?

24:29.930 --> 24:30.897
Yes.

24:30.930 --> 24:32.124
VVho?

24:32.170 --> 24:33.262
I don't know.

24:33.300 --> 24:34.836
_ He wouldn't
give me his name.

24:34.870 --> 24:36.565
He asked for the number
on your check.

24:36.600 --> 24:37.669
Did you give it?

24:37.710 --> 24:40.133
No.

24:42.180 --> 24:43.841
Thanks.

24:43.880 --> 24:46.178
He called me back.

24:50.750 --> 24:52.718
What's going on, Kalinda?

24:52.750 --> 24:56.208
It's just something
from an old thing.

24:56.260 --> 24:57.659
"An old thing"?

24:57.690 --> 24:58.850
Is it Lemond Bishop?

24:58.890 --> 25:01.597
No. I'm gonna go
and take care of it.

25:01.630 --> 25:02.892
Kalinda.

25:02.930 --> 25:04.818
Yeah?

25:07.230 --> 25:08.891
Nothing.

25:08.940 --> 25:10.168
I'll be back.

25:10.200 --> 25:12.009
I'm-I'm gonna go
take care of it.

25:44.070 --> 25:45.833
That might be
too big for you.

25:45.870 --> 25:46.359
I've got some lighter
ones around the corner.

25:46.410 --> 25:47.707
No, this one's fine.

25:47.740 --> 25:48.934
You sure?

25:48.980 --> 25:50.971
You need anything else,
let me know.

25:52.980 --> 25:54.971
(elevator bell dings)

26:24.710 --> 26:26.268
*

26:54.780 --> 26:56.771
*

27:26.470 --> 27:29.769
ZACH: And it's not just
the sink, the shower, too.

27:29.810 --> 27:31.209
Okay, I'll call down,
but we're probably on our own.

27:31.250 --> 27:33.718
They go out of their
way not to fix things

27:33.750 --> 27:35.911
When they're converting to
condos, so it forces you to buy.

27:35.950 --> 27:38.214
Are you gonna?

27:38.250 --> 27:39.945
Buy?

27:39.990 --> 27:41.810
I don't know.

27:41.860 --> 27:44.420
I like it here,
but maybe there's better.

27:44.460 --> 27:46.428
Dad wants you
to buy the house.

27:46.460 --> 27:48.155
He...
He told you

27:48.200 --> 27:50.225
he wanted to sell it,
didn't he?

27:50.260 --> 27:51.227
Would you?

27:51.270 --> 27:53.022
Buy the house?
Yeah.

27:53.070 --> 27:54.264
No.
Why not?

27:54.300 --> 27:55.267
You were going to.

27:55.300 --> 27:56.267
I know, but everything's

27:56.300 --> 27:57.392
up in the air right now.

27:57.440 --> 27:59.101
You got a raise.

27:59.140 --> 28:01.108
Yes. But sometimes
getting a raise

28:01.140 --> 28:03.108
means that you cost more,
so when they're looking

28:03.140 --> 28:05.870
to downsize, it's easier to
fire you than someone cheaper.

28:05.910 --> 28:07.207
And they're
looking to downsize?

28:07.250 --> 28:09.946
No, but we're just going
through a bad spell.

28:09.980 --> 28:11.117
GRACE:
You should move in.

28:11.150 --> 28:15.154
_ We should all
live in one house.

28:15.190 --> 28:17.078
What?

28:17.120 --> 28:19.179
Not like you guys
are married.

28:19.230 --> 28:20.857
Like a commune.

28:20.900 --> 28:21.855
Hmm.

28:21.900 --> 28:24.118
(both laugh)

28:24.170 --> 28:26.229
I've kind of grown
to like you.

28:26.270 --> 28:28.067
Yeah? Not Zach?

28:28.100 --> 28:29.169
No, not Zach.

28:29.200 --> 28:30.189
He's getting too big.

28:30.240 --> 28:32.231
(chuckles):
Hey.

28:32.270 --> 28:33.999
(cell phone ringing)

28:34.040 --> 28:35.268
You shouldn't
answer it.

28:35.310 --> 28:36.800
It's probably work.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.842
They can't fire you
if they can't find you.

28:38.880 --> 28:40.006
Very funny.

28:45.550 --> 28:46.517
(sighs)

28:46.550 --> 28:47.517
Hello?

28:47.550 --> 28:50.519
MAN:
Alicia Florrick?

28:50.560 --> 28:52.118
(phone beeps)

28:52.160 --> 28:53.286
GRACE:
Is it work?

28:53.330 --> 28:55.321
No. Wrong number.

28:59.100 --> 29:01.864
(phone keypad beeping)

29:03.400 --> 29:05.903
KALINDA (recorded):
This is Kalinda.
Please leave a message.

29:05.940 --> 29:07.237
(voicemail beeps)

29:09.340 --> 29:11.308
WILL:
You ready for this?

29:11.350 --> 29:12.408
I hope so.

29:12.450 --> 29:13.917
Don't worry, it'll
all be about me.

29:13.950 --> 29:14.769
Just tell the truth.

29:14.820 --> 29:16.811
(toy playing "Mary Had
a Little Lamb")

29:16.850 --> 29:18.112
Have you seen Kalinda?

29:18.150 --> 29:19.117
No, Why?

29:19.150 --> 29:20.185
She's not in today.

29:20.220 --> 29:22.188
She's probably
just late.

29:22.220 --> 29:24.222
PATTI:
You were second chair

29:24.260 --> 29:26.956
on the Veriscene case,
right, Mrs. Florrick?

29:26.990 --> 29:28.321
Yes.

29:28.360 --> 29:30.021
Did you have
ex parte communication

29:30.060 --> 29:31.266
With Judge Wynter
during the trial?

29:31.300 --> 29:33.325
No.
And you have
no personal

29:33.370 --> 29:35.031
relationship with Judge Wynter?
That's correct.

29:35.070 --> 29:37.163
But someone you know does?

29:37.200 --> 29:39.168
You mean Will?

29:39.210 --> 29:40.165
No.

29:40.210 --> 29:42.508
I mean your husband.

29:43.310 --> 29:45.005
Peter Florrick.

29:47.050 --> 29:48.244
1-1 have no idea.

29:48.280 --> 29:49.941
CANNING:
You have no idea Whether

29:49.980 --> 29:51.516
your husband has a personal
relationship with Judge Wynter?

29:51.550 --> 29:53.017
I mean, I know that

29:53.050 --> 29:54.381
he knows him, but I don't know

29:54.420 --> 29:55.978
the extent of
their relationship.

29:56.020 --> 29:57.317
Did you know that your husband

29:57.360 --> 29:59.225
met with Judge Wynter
three times

29:59.260 --> 30:03.219
in the week leading up to
the Veriscene verdict?

30:03.260 --> 30:04.295
No.
Really?

30:04.330 --> 30:06.992
On the eve of Judge Wynter's
decision to award you

30:07.030 --> 30:10.329
$25 million, your husband
met with him three times,

30:10.370 --> 30:12.338
and you had no idea?
That's correct.

30:12.370 --> 30:14.372
DIANE:
Are we working off
the assumption

30:14.410 --> 30:16.435
they did, in fact, meet?
How do we know this?

30:16.480 --> 30:18.471
Because we're going
to subpoena Peter Florrick.

30:20.510 --> 30:23.240
DIANE:
You're g0ing to subpoena
the state's attorney?

30:23.280 --> 30:24.884
We already have.

30:30.620 --> 30:33.953
Hold the door, please.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.456
Thanks.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.252
No problem. 28th?

30:37.300 --> 30:39.291
Yeah.

30:47.980 --> 30:50.972
(elevator buzzing)

30:56.950 --> 31:00.249
So, you seeing Alicia?

31:00.290 --> 31:02.110
Am I seeing Alicia?

31:02.160 --> 31:03.650
No, actually, I'm being deposed.

31:03.690 --> 31:05.055
Oh. Really?

31:05.090 --> 31:06.318
Although it
occurred to me

31:06.360 --> 31:08.157
I've never seen
Where AliCia works.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.327
Does she know
you're coming?

31:10.360 --> 31:13.659
Not that it matters
either way.

31:13.700 --> 31:15.395
I don't know.

31:15.440 --> 31:18.432
So you must be looking forward
to getting back to the laW, huh?

31:18.470 --> 31:20.233
Iam.

31:20.270 --> 31:22.500
I think convicts
call it "short time."

31:22.540 --> 31:23.677
Really?

31:23.710 --> 31:25.905
I never did.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.309
(elevator bell dings)

31:34.220 --> 31:36.518
Well, hi.

31:36.560 --> 31:38.084
Hi.

31:38.130 --> 31:39.529
Look who I found.

31:39.560 --> 31:41.357
Yes. Welcome.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.391
I thought I would come
and meet you.

31:43.430 --> 31:44.328
Which one?

31:44.370 --> 31:46.691
You, Peter.

31:46.730 --> 31:48.266
Thought you might want
to see my office.

31:48.300 --> 31:49.597
WILL: Hello, Eli.
Yeah.

31:49.640 --> 31:52.234
I...

31:52.270 --> 31:53.498
Hi.

31:53.540 --> 31:55.235
H-Hello, everyone.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.407
Hi. I wasjust

31:57.440 --> 31:58.577
showing Peter my office.

31:58.610 --> 32:00.373
He's here
for a deposition.

32:00.410 --> 32:01.616
Really?

32:01.650 --> 32:04.084
Good. Great.

32:04.120 --> 32:05.087
Cary.

32:05.120 --> 32:06.382
Hey, Cary.
Hello.

32:06.420 --> 32:08.479
Hello, Mr. Florrick.
How you doing?

32:08.520 --> 32:09.316
Hey, how you
guys doing?
Hi.

32:09.360 --> 32:10.554
So how's it going here?

32:10.590 --> 32:12.251
At Lockhart-Gardner? It's good.

32:12.290 --> 32:14.190
I mean, I loved the state's
attorney's office,

32:14.230 --> 32:16.289
but there's a lot
of smart people here, too.

32:16.330 --> 32:18.321
(toy playing
"Mary Had a Little Lamb")

32:20.330 --> 32:22.139
One of our new
assoaates.

32:22.170 --> 32:23.159
(elevator bell dings)

32:24.140 --> 32:26.358
Hey, Kalinda.

32:28.180 --> 32:30.432
It's a surprise
party for you.

32:30.480 --> 32:34.109
I'm impressed.

32:34.150 --> 32:36.471
What you have done
in three years is amazing.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.249
Thank you.

32:38.290 --> 32:39.211
Okay.

32:39.250 --> 32:42.151
I guess I should go
meet my executioners.

32:42.190 --> 32:44.078
Oh, Peter, you didn't
have to do this.

32:44.130 --> 32:45.324
You could've blown it off.

32:45.360 --> 32:46.486
It's a stupid nuisance suit.

32:46.530 --> 32:48.555
I wanted to get out
and stretch my legs.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.989
Hey. Come over tonight.

32:51.030 --> 32:52.998
I'll have to work.
Just to see the house.

32:53.030 --> 32:54.634
Stay for five minutes, tops.
I wish I could.

32:54.670 --> 32:57.468
Peter?

32:57.500 --> 32:59.058
Have you checked in
on Jackie lately?

32:59.110 --> 33:00.236
Have I?

33:00.270 --> 33:01.476
Yeah. Why?

33:01.510 --> 33:02.602
I'm worried.

33:02.640 --> 33:04.198
She seems confused.

33:04.250 --> 33:06.502
She's getting older.

33:06.550 --> 33:08.643
Hey...

33:08.680 --> 33:11.114
congratulations.

33:12.420 --> 33:13.682
You made it.

33:23.760 --> 33:26.399
You need money?

33:26.430 --> 33:29.536
Just an advance
on the work so far.

33:29.570 --> 33:31.458
Why?

33:34.340 --> 33:35.568
Kalinda, What's going on?

33:35.610 --> 33:37.669
1-1 have to go.

33:37.710 --> 33:40.747
You have to... Why?

33:40.780 --> 33:43.146
I thought you were
liking it here.

33:43.180 --> 33:45.341
I am liking it here.

33:45.390 --> 33:46.743
Okay, then you
would understand

33:46.790 --> 33:49.315
my confusion.

33:52.330 --> 33:54.753
Look”.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.449
we're in a bit of trouble.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.821
We're_short
on receivables.

33:58.870 --> 34:01.338
Patric Edelstein
is delaying his monthly,

34:01.370 --> 34:04.100
and we have some long-term suits
that haven't paid out yet.

34:05.240 --> 34:06.798
I can get you some.

34:06.840 --> 34:08.478
Not everything.

34:10.510 --> 34:13.070
Okay.

34:14.720 --> 34:15.846
This is good-bye?

34:15.880 --> 34:17.677
Just for a little bit.

34:17.720 --> 34:20.382
You're gonna make me cry.

34:21.660 --> 34:23.719
(wry laugh)
I don't know.

34:23.760 --> 34:27.548
It feels like things
are falling apart.

34:27.590 --> 34:30.650
You'll build them up again,
that's what you do.

34:42.880 --> 34:43.938
And you met with
Judge Wynter three times

34:43.980 --> 34:47.143
before this last Thursday,
the day of the verdict?

34:47.180 --> 34:48.317
Yes.

34:48.350 --> 34:49.510
Is that a lot for you?

34:49.550 --> 34:51.188
Yeah.

34:51.220 --> 34:53.484
In fact, before these
three meetings,

34:53.520 --> 34:55.385
you had only
met him once...

34:55.420 --> 34:56.614
in 2008

34:56.660 --> 34:58.355
at a judge's lunch,

34:58.390 --> 35:01.257
With 12 other judges.

35:01.300 --> 35:02.619
Yeah, that sounds
about right.

35:02.660 --> 35:05.322
So Why'd you meet with him?

35:05.370 --> 35:06.291
PETER:
Those three times?

35:06.330 --> 35:08.434
I like him.

35:09.740 --> 35:11.469
Did the subject
of your wife's lawsuit

35:11.510 --> 35:12.738
come up
at these meetings?

35:12.770 --> 35:14.328
No.
Really?

35:14.380 --> 35:16.302
At the same time you were
meeting with this judge,

35:16.340 --> 35:18.479
your Wife had a suit
in front of him,

35:18.510 --> 35:20.341
and the subject never came up?

35:20.380 --> 35:21.642
That's correct.
This grand jury
investigation

35:21.680 --> 35:23.773
into Will Gardner's
supposed bribing

35:23.820 --> 35:25.583
of three judges,
including Judge Wynters...

35:25.620 --> 35:26.644
Objection.

35:26.690 --> 35:27.782
PATTI:
We are not referring

35:27.820 --> 35:29.310
to the content
of that investigation,

35:29.360 --> 35:32.158
just to Mr. Florrick's
supervision of it.

35:32.190 --> 35:33.179
But just to correct you,

35:33.230 --> 35:35.391
uh, Ms. Scott-Carr
had supervision over it.
Yes,

35:35.430 --> 35:36.499
until you removed her.
I removed her

35:36.530 --> 35:38.327
because the grand jury
had concluded.

35:38.370 --> 35:40.167
But the state's attorney
can bring charges again?

35:40.200 --> 35:41.838
He can. I chose not to.

35:41.870 --> 35:43.462
You also chose not
to bring charges against

35:43.500 --> 35:45.866
the three judges
involved in this bribery scheme.

35:45.910 --> 35:48.333
The supposed
bribery scheme? Yes.

35:48.380 --> 35:49.472
Why not?
I didn't want to.

35:49.510 --> 35:52.343
I thought Ms. Scott-Carr
had gone beyond her directive.

35:52.380 --> 35:54.519
So when you met
With Judge Wynter...

35:54.550 --> 35:55.778
he owed you?

35:57.980 --> 35:59.686
Did you not want to answer?

35:59.720 --> 36:02.314
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know
that was a question.

36:02.360 --> 36:04.453
CANNING: Didn't you ask
Judge Wynter to decide

36:04.490 --> 36:07.425
this verdict for your wife
as a quid pro quo

36:07.460 --> 36:08.688
for dropping his investigation?
No.

36:08.730 --> 36:10.459
But isn't that
a fair conclusion?

36:10.500 --> 36:12.525
No.
And how is that?

36:14.500 --> 36:17.162
Because my Wife
and I are separated.

36:20.010 --> 36:21.500
Then I...

36:21.540 --> 36:23.269
(laughs)

36:24.680 --> 36:26.272
That is news to me.

36:27.380 --> 36:28.472
Then what other reason

36:28.520 --> 36:29.942
could there be
for these meetings?

36:29.980 --> 36:33.245
His support for my campaign.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.983
So I guess you could accuse me

36:37.020 --> 36:40.285
of being corrupt for myself,

36:40.330 --> 36:42.457
but not for my Wife.

36:48.030 --> 36:49.463
How's it going?

36:49.500 --> 36:51.468
Good. You?

36:51.510 --> 36:52.568
Good.

36:52.610 --> 36:55.408
I have to head out.
I just wanted to say good night.

36:55.440 --> 36:57.408
That man Who called me,

36:57.440 --> 36:59.408
F&E Construction,

36:59.450 --> 37:01.771
he called me at home,

37:01.820 --> 37:03.640
and he said my name.

37:06.450 --> 37:08.418
He said your name?
Yes.

37:08.460 --> 37:10.485
Did you give your name?

37:10.520 --> 37:12.226
No.

37:12.960 --> 37:16.020
Kalinda,
Who is this man?

37:16.060 --> 37:18.597
We said we would be up front
With each other.

37:18.630 --> 37:20.427
I know.

37:20.470 --> 37:22.529
Is this man dangerous?

37:22.570 --> 37:24.435
Yeah.

37:24.470 --> 37:27.405
Well, Who is he?

37:29.510 --> 37:31.398
He's my husband.

37:34.050 --> 37:36.746
Come on.
You don't have anything.

37:36.780 --> 37:38.839
The state's attorney
just told you

37:38.890 --> 37:41.450
there's no way he could have
done this for his Wife

37:41.490 --> 37:43.014
because they're separated.

37:43.060 --> 37:45.949
And he's done this with
some considerable expense

37:45.990 --> 37:47.719
to his own political career...

37:47.760 --> 37:50.297
because it's now in the record
that they've separated.

37:50.330 --> 37:52.469
So, What do you have?

37:52.500 --> 37:54.058
PATTI:
A pa55ion to see
this through.

37:54.100 --> 37:57.536
WILL:
We take back our offer
to drop the class action.

37:57.570 --> 37:59.663
You lost. Face it.

37:59.710 --> 38:01.063
They're right.

38:01.110 --> 38:02.975
We lost.

38:03.010 --> 38:04.546
We should probably
just head out.

38:04.580 --> 38:06.844
You think?

38:06.880 --> 38:08.541
Here's the thing, though.

38:08.580 --> 38:10.639
We were the distraction.

38:10.680 --> 38:12.545
You were the distraction?
What does that mean?

38:12.590 --> 38:15.787
CANNING:
Have you checked on your
top client, Patric Edelstein?

38:15.820 --> 38:17.617
He's no longer your top client.

38:17.660 --> 38:18.581
He's ours.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.325
_ PATTI:
We just got the text.

38:20.360 --> 38:21.691
He's been unhappy
With Will's suspension,

38:21.730 --> 38:24.563
and with your distraction
With this lawsuit.

38:24.600 --> 38:26.522
CANNING: Sleight of hand.
You were watching the right,

38:26.570 --> 38:28.492
you should've been
watching the left.

38:28.540 --> 38:29.666
Mommy!
That's right,

38:29.700 --> 38:31.099
we're done here.

38:31.140 --> 38:33.028
Mommy's coming home.

38:33.070 --> 38:34.537
CANNING:
After you.

38:34.580 --> 38:35.831
PATTI:
No, no, after you.

38:35.880 --> 38:36.835
Please.

38:36.880 --> 38:38.643
Mommy!
Hello!

38:38.680 --> 38:40.545
PATTI:
Let's go. Come on.

38:40.580 --> 38:42.548
Oops.

38:44.890 --> 38:47.017
And it's too late
to call him.

38:47.050 --> 38:49.359
They planned
on that, too.

38:49.390 --> 38:51.381
(sighs)

38:52.960 --> 38:55.099
So...

38:55.130 --> 38:57.621
tomorrow?

38:57.660 --> 39:00.060
Tomorrow.

39:12.680 --> 39:14.648
How you doing?

39:14.680 --> 39:17.649
Me? I'm, uh...

39:17.680 --> 39:19.944
okay.

39:19.990 --> 39:21.139
You?

39:21.190 --> 39:23.658
Same.

39:23.690 --> 39:25.521
That was weird.

39:25.560 --> 39:27.653
With Peter today?

39:27.690 --> 39:29.658
Yes, it was.

39:44.880 --> 39:46.939
Do you think it was a mistake?

39:48.720 --> 39:50.915
No.

39:51.950 --> 39:53.781
(elevator bell dings)

39:56.590 --> 39:58.478
Good night, Alicia.

39:58.530 --> 40:00.680
Good night, Will.

40:00.730 --> 40:02.721
(elevator doors close)

40:04.230 --> 40:06.164
* In the hell

40:06.200 --> 40:08.964
* Beneath the stairs

40:11.670 --> 40:13.706
* There's someone

40:13.740 --> 40:16.732
* In that room

40:18.750 --> 40:20.843
* That frightens you

40:20.880 --> 40:23.747
* When they go boom

40:25.850 --> 40:29.183
* Boom, boom, boom

40:29.220 --> 40:31.450
* Boom, boom

40:31.490 --> 40:32.479
* Boom

40:33.590 --> 40:35.126
* Boom, boom, boom...

40:35.160 --> 40:37.856
GRACE: Mom,my doorknob's
still broken.

40:37.900 --> 40:39.663
PETER:
How about some wine?

40:39.700 --> 40:41.691
No, I have to get back.

40:42.770 --> 40:44.465
They didn't change much.

40:44.510 --> 40:46.535
The house? Yeah.

40:46.570 --> 40:47.662
They tried to flip it,

40:47.710 --> 40:49.177
but they didn't put
any work into it

40:49.210 --> 40:50.632
so nobody wanted it.

40:52.180 --> 40:53.841
Thanks for today.

40:53.880 --> 40:55.211
I think you stopped
the suit.

40:55.250 --> 40:56.842
(sighs)

40:56.880 --> 40:58.586
I guess I just
told the truth.

40:58.620 --> 41:00.247
That's bigger than you think.

41:00.290 --> 41:02.019
(timer beeps)

41:02.060 --> 41:03.812
GRACE:
Dad, the pizza's ready.

41:03.860 --> 41:05.122
Okay.

41:05.160 --> 41:07.082
Pizza?
No, I have to

41:07.130 --> 41:10.759
get up early for work tomorrow.
Things are in flux.

41:10.800 --> 41:13.963
When aren't things in flux?

41:17.800 --> 41:20.132
Hey, come say good-bye
to your mom.

41:20.170 --> 41:21.159
She's leaving.

41:23.140 --> 41:26.678
* I...

41:26.710 --> 41:30.646
* Met you

41:30.680 --> 41:34.116
* I...

41:34.150 --> 41:37.813
* Met you

41:37.860 --> 41:39.828
* Boom...

41:49.170 --> 41:51.035
ALICIA:
I love you both.

41:51.070 --> 41:52.765
I'll see you in
a few days.

41:55.780 --> 41:56.599
Stay, Mom.

41:56.640 --> 41:59.006
No one will think
it means anything.

41:59.050 --> 42:00.574
Just...

42:00.610 --> 42:01.713
have some pizza.

42:01.750 --> 42:02.944
Then you can go.
